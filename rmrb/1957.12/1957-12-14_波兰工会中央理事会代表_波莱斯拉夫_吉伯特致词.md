Speech by Bolesław Jaszczuk, Representative of the Central Council of Trade Unions of Poland

Dear Comrades and Friends:

　　I have come to China this time with a glorious mission, that is, on behalf of the Presidium of the Central Council of Trade Unions of Poland and the Polish working class and its mass organization—the trade union, to extend our heartfelt brotherly congratulations to your Congress and all the working people of the People's Republic of China.

　　We sincerely congratulate your Congress, which is a major event in the life of the Chinese working masses and all the people, and it will usher in an important stage in the activities of Chinese trade unions. The Polish working people and all the people cherish sincere, brotherly sympathy and friendship for the heroic Chinese working class and the Chinese people, who are famous for their heroism in the liberation struggle and have a rich and ancient culture. We highly appreciate the role played by the great Chinese people in consolidating the cause of peace and opening up the road to social progress in the world.

　　In recent years, close brotherly ties have been established between the trade unions of our two countries. This is a relationship that links the people of our two countries in the common struggle for peace and socialist ideals.

　　Like you, we are proud and pleased by the historical achievements of the Chinese people in developing industry and agriculture and in raising the living standards and cultural level of the masses.

　　The Polish working class observes your daily work and struggle with sincere feelings of solidarity and deep admiration.

　　In the past thirteen years, the working people of the Polish People's Republic have made great achievements in the cause of building socialism. This period has been a stage of great changes in the history of the Polish people, and a stage of selfless efforts to restore and develop the national economy. In this regard, we have achieved great success. We have fundamentally changed the economic and social structure of our country. We have restored many cities destroyed by the Hitlerite occupiers, including our capital, Warsaw. The broad masses of the people can receive education and enjoy cultural life.

　　Under the leadership of the Party, the Polish people and the entire working class are implementing a program of reforming our political and economic life, strengthening socialist forces, and creating perfect conditions for the development of socialist democracy. Our working class is overcoming difficulties and dealing with internal contradictions that arise in the construction of socialism.

　　The changes that have taken place in our country have opened up broad avenues for the activities of trade unions, for the development of the initiative and activities of the working masses, for improving production methods through expanded worker participation in enterprise management, for fully utilizing the production potential of enterprises, and for reducing production costs.

　　In order to realize the wishes of the masses and taking into account their criticisms, the Polish trade unions have carried out major reforms in their work.

　　Our goal is to develop trade unions on a completely democratic basis and ensure close ties between trade union organizations and their leadership and the masses of trade union members. The purpose of this reform is to improve the activities of trade unions, enhance the role they play in national life, and enable them to better fulfill their responsibilities as representatives and educators of the working masses. Our trade unions cooperate with workers' committees and play a major role in developing production and improving the economic work of enterprises. We are striving to make the activities of trade unions and workers' committees play a greater role in adopting new democratic methods to manage and lead the economy, in increasing the influence of all workers in enterprises on production, and in enabling the people of the whole country to have good living conditions.

　　Polish trade unions attach great importance to close cooperation between trade unions of various countries—this cooperation is carried out in accordance with the program of the World Federation of Trade Unions and the principles established by the Fourth World Trade Union Congress. In the relations between our country and the trade unions of other countries, we attach particular importance to the increasingly close cooperation with the Chinese trade unions.

　　Our friendship comes from deep ideological ties and our common ideals of socialism and proletarian internationalism.

　　The strength of this friendship comes from the solidarity of the socialist family of nations. The socialist countries are united under the great banner of Marxism-Leninism, under the banner of the struggle for peace and social progress, against the threat of new wars and the plans of imperialist adventurers.

　　We believe that with the brotherly cooperation of socialist countries, the people of our country will move forward more rapidly on the road of socialist construction. The guarantee of this rapid progress is the continuous growth of the strength and vitality of socialist countries, and the existence of the first socialist country—the Soviet Union, the cradle of the great October Socialist Revolution. We have already celebrated the fortieth anniversary of this revolution under the circumstances that the socialist ideals have won victory and the socialist science and technology are especially prosperous and flourishing.

　　The unbreakable friendship, unity and cooperation between the working classes and trade unions of various countries in our great camp are indispensable factors for our common struggle and for the further development of the socialist construction of our countries and the improvement of the material and cultural living standards of the working people of our countries.

　　Dear friends, it is with these wishes that we have come to your country and participate in this great congress. The achievements of your congress will undoubtedly make a creative and valuable contribution to the entire international trade union movement.

　　Currently, the Polish trade unions are preparing for their Fourth National Congress. Please allow me to express that we will be honored to welcome a delegation from the Chinese trade unions at our Congress.

　　At the same time, please allow me to extend on behalf of the entire leadership of the Polish trade union movement and the workers of our country to you, representatives of brothers, to your great All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the working class of the People's Republic of China, our most heartfelt congratulations.

　　Thank you for your invitation and brotherly hospitality, and congratulations to the Congress for achieving results that will be beneficial to the working class and the Chinese people, and for the smooth development on your socialist construction road.

　　Long live the unbreakable friendship between the people of Poland and China!

　　Long live the ever-increasing unity of the socialist countries!

　　Long live the fraternal friendship of the working people of the world!

　　波兰工会中央理事会代表
    波莱斯拉夫·吉伯特致词亲爱的同志们和朋友们：
    我这次来到中国负有一个光荣的使命，就是代表波兰工会中央理事会主席团和波兰工人阶级和它的群众性的团体——工会，向你们的大会和全体中华人民共和国劳动人民致以衷心的兄弟般的祝贺。
    我们衷心地祝贺你们的大会，它是中国劳动群众和全体人民生活中的一件大事，它将在中国工会的活动中开始一个重要阶段。波兰劳动人民和全体人民，对于英勇的中国工人阶级，和在解放斗争中以英勇著名的、有着丰富古老文化的中国人民，怀着诚挚的、兄弟般的同情和友谊。我们对于伟大的中国人民在巩固和平事业上和开辟世界社会进步的道路上所起的作用，有极高的评价。
    最近几年来，我们两国的工会之间建立起亲密的兄弟般的联系。这是联结着我们两国人民为共同争取和平与社会主义理想的一种关系。
    我们也和你们一样，由于中国人民在发展工业和农业、在提高群众的生活水平和文化水平中获得历史性的成就，而感到骄傲和愉快。
    波兰工人阶级以衷心的团结的感情和深刻的钦佩心情，注视着你们的每天的工作和斗争。
    在过去十三年中，波兰人民共和国的劳动人民在建设社会主义的事业中，获得了很大的成就。这一个时期，在波兰人民历史上是一个有巨大变化的阶段，是一个为恢复和发展国民经济而奋不顾身的努力的阶段。在这方面，我们得到很大的成就。我们根本改变了我们国家的经济社会结构。我们使被希特勒占领者破坏的许多城市恢复起来，其中包括我们的首都——华沙。广大的人民群众都能受到教育和享受文化生活。
    波兰人民和全体工人阶级，在党的领导下，正在实行着革新我们政治和经济生活的纲领，加强社会主义力量，创造发展社会主义民主的完善的条件。我国的工人阶级正在克服困难，以及处理在建设社会主义时出现的内部矛盾。
    我国所发生的变化，为工会的活动、为劳动群众的主动性的发挥与活动的发展、为经过扩大工人参加企业管理改进生产方法，为充分利用企业生产潜力，为降低生产成本等方面，开辟了广阔的道路。
    波兰工会为了实现群众的愿望，并考虑到他们的批评，对自己的工作进行过重大的改革。
    我们努力的方向是，要使工会在完全民主的基础上发展，保证工会的组织和它们的领导机构与工会会员群众之间保持密切联系。这个改革的目的是要改进工会的活动，提高工会在国家生活中所起的作用，使它们能很好地履行作为劳动群众的代表和教育者的职责。我们的工会同工人委员会共同合作，在发展生产和提高企业的经济工作水平方面起了很大的作用。我们正在努力使工会和工人委员会的活动，对于采用新的民主方法来管理和领导经济，对于增加企业全体工人对生产的影响，对于使全国人民有很好的生活条件，能起更大的作用。
    波兰工会极为重视各国工会之间的密切合作——这种合作是根据世界工会联合会的纲领和世界工会第四次代表大会所确定的原则进行的。在我国与其他国家工会的关系中，我们特别重视同中国工会的越来越密切的合作。
    我们之间的友谊，来自意识形态的深厚联系以及我们的社会主义和无产阶级国际主义的共同理想。
    这种友谊的力量来自社会主义国家大家庭的团结。社会主义国家是在伟大的马克思列宁主义的旗帜下，在为争取和平和社会进步、反对新的战争威胁和帝国主义冒险分子的计划的斗争的旗帜下团结起来的。
    我们相信，在社会主义国家兄弟般的合作下，我国人民在社会主义建设的道路上将更迅速的前进。这种迅速的进展的保证是社会主义国家的力量和活力的不断增长，是第一个社会主义国家——苏联，伟大的十月社会主义革命的摇篮——的存在。我们已经在社会主义理想获得胜利、社会主义的科学和技术特别昌盛繁荣的情况下，庆祝了这一革命的四十周年。
    我们伟大的阵营内各国工人阶级和工会之间牢不可破的友谊、团结和合作，是我们的共同斗争和为进一步发展我们各国的社会主义建设以及提高我们各国劳动人民的物质与文化生活水平所不可缺少的因素。
    亲爱的朋友们，我们就是抱着这些愿望来到你们的国家并参加这个伟大的代表大会的。你们代表大会的成就，无疑地会对整个国际工会运动作出具有创造性的宝贵贡献。
    目前，波兰工会正在筹备自己的第四次全国代表大会。请允许我表示：我们将能在我们的大会上，荣幸地欢迎中国工会的代表团。
    同时请允许我代表波兰工会运动的全体领导人和我国的工人向你们，代表兄弟们，向你们伟大的总工会和中华人民共和国工人阶级致以最衷心的祝贺。
    感谢你们的邀请和兄弟般的招待，祝贺大会为工人阶级和中国人民的利益，为在你们社会主义建设道路上顺利发展获得成果。
    波中两国人民之间牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    社会主义国家的日益增强的团结万岁！
    全世界劳动人民的兄弟般的友谊万岁！
