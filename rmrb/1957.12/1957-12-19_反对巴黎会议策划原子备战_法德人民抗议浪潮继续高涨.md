    Protests Continue to Surge in France and Germany

    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 17th: The movement to protest the establishment of atomic weapons storage depots and rocket launch installations on French territory is expanding daily in France.

    In recent days, many gatherings have been held within France to express this protest, and the government and members of the National Assembly have received tens of thousands of petitions, resolutions, and telegrams.

    On the 16th, another eighty-five figures from the academic community sent a letter to Prime Minister Gaillard opposing the atomic weapons storage program being discussed by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, demanding that West Germany not be allowed to produce or possess nuclear weapons. Those signing the letter included Frédéric Joliot-Curie, Jean Gasso Chattelier, and Jean Hauser.

    According to "Liberation," some French social activists and politicians have formed a "Committee to Protest the Setting Up of Atomic Weapons Storage Depots and Nuclear Rocket Launch Installations in France."

    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 18th: According to a Deutsche Presse-Agentur dispatch on the 17th, the wave of protests against the North Atlantic Group's atomic arms expansion plan continues to surge in various parts of Germany.

    Many industrial enterprises in the German Democratic Republic held mass rallies with the participation of many workers. Resolutions were passed at the meetings protesting the atomic war preparation plan being drafted by the North Atlantic Group Council's Paris conference.

    More than three hundred citizens of Ansbach, Bavaria, West Germany, held a town meeting. A resolution was passed at the meeting opposing the establishment of atomic rocket launch bases and atomic weapons storage depots in West Germany.

    Professor Gerlach, a well-known atomic scientist and a signatory to the famous "Göttingen Declaration" against equipping the West German army with atomic weapons, issued a statement, following the ten well-known professors of Heidelberg University, reiterating his adherence to the principles of the "Göttingen Declaration" and opposing "any form of atomic armament" for West Germany.

    Professor Wieber, an eighty-nine-year-old professor at Heidelberg University, delivered a broadcast address on television and radio on the 16th, calling for the prevention of the North Atlantic Group's Paris conference from reaching an agreement on the establishment of missile bases in West Germany.
