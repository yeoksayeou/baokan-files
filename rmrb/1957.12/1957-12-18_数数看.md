    Let's Count

    This is a game. The way to play is: look at the picture and count horizontally, row by row, from left to right; when counting, count the cats, geese, and chickens separately and add them separately; do not pause in the middle, and the faster you count, the better. For example, "One cat, one goose, two cats, one chicken, three cats, two geese, ...".

    Please try it and see how much you can count without making a mistake? Is it one hundred? One thousand? Or several thousand? (Picture attached)

    数数看
    这是一种游戏。玩的方法是：看着图，从左至右，一排一排地横着数；数的时候，猫、鹅和鸡分开数、分开加；不许中间停歇，数得越快越好。如“一只猫、一只鹅，两只猫、一只鸡，三只猫、两只鹅，……。”
    请试试看，你能不出差错地数多少？是一百？一千？还是几千？（附图片）
