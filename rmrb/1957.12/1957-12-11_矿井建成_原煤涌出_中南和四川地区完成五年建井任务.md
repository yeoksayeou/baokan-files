Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, December 8th: The Zhengzhou Administration of the Ministry of Coal Industry has overfulfilled the basic construction task for the coal industry in the Central South region stipulated by the state's first Five-Year Plan by the end of November.

　　Over the past five years, the Administration has vigorously restored and renovated the original mines in the existing coal industrial bases of Jiaozuo, Pingxiang, and Zixing, doubling their production capacity compared to 1952. At the same time, it has focused on constructing new coal industrial bases in Pingdingshan, Hebi, and other areas.

　　During the first Five-Year Plan period, eighteen new mine shafts were successively built in the Central South region, of which five have been put into production and have already reached an average of 90% of their designed daily output. Twelve mine shafts are under construction, of which two are about to be handed over for production.

　　In order to guarantee the coal supply for the Wuhan Iron and Steel United Enterprise under construction, two medium-sized coal washing plants were built in the Central South region ahead of schedule. The Pingxiang coal washing plant has already been put into production in October of this year.

　　The coal industrial construction team in the Central South region has also developed rapidly over the past five years. The exploration force has increased more than tenfold compared to five years ago, and the design team has expanded twentyfold.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 8th: The mine construction of the Chongqing Administration of the Ministry of Coal Industry has completed the first Five-Year Plan one month ahead of schedule. As of November this year, eight new mine shafts with a total annual output of 3.16 million tons have started construction in the Sichuan region.

　　During the first Five-Year Plan period, the coal mine development in the Sichuan region was extremely rapid. Due to the renovation and technical transformation of most of the original nine mine shafts under the Chongqing Coal Administration Bureau, the output has increased from 1.12 million tons in 1952 to 2.41 million tons this year (estimated figure), an average annual increase of 21.9%. However, the coal output still cannot meet the growing needs of the Sichuan region. Therefore, the construction of mines on an unprecedented scale began in the later period of the first Five-Year Plan. The mine construction force has developed from scratch. At present, a construction team capable of undertaking the construction of mines with an annual output of more than 3 million tons has been formed. The geological and design forces have also developed rapidly.

　　During the first Five-Year Plan, the mine construction of the Chongqing Coal Administration Bureau was mainly concentrated in the Nantong mining area in the Sichuan region, the Huarong mountain area on both sides of the Jialing River, and the Yongrong mining area along the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. During the second Five-Year Plan, not only will these mining areas have greater development, but also the construction of modern mines will begin on the Yunnan and Guizhou Plateaus.

### 矿井建成　原煤涌出  中南和四川地区完成五年建井任务

　　矿井建成　原煤涌出
    中南和四川地区完成五年建井任务
    据新华社郑州8日电　煤炭工业部郑州管理局已在11月底超额完成国家第一个五年计划规定的中南区煤炭工业基本建设任务。
    五年以来，管理局对焦作、萍乡、资兴等原有煤炭工业基地的原有矿井，大力进行了恢复改建，使这些矿井生产能力较1952年提高一倍。同时，着重建设了平顶山、鹤壁等新的煤炭工业基地。
    中南地区在第一个五年计划期间陆续新建的矿井有十八对，其中有五对已经投入生产，并且已经平均达到设计日产量的90％；正在建设的矿井有十二对，其中有两对即将移交生产。
    为了保证兴建中的武汉钢铁联合企业的用煤，在中南地区还超计划地建设了两座中型选煤厂，其中萍乡选煤厂已经在今年10月投入生产。
    中南地区煤炭工业建设的队伍，五年来也发展很快。勘探力量，已经比五年前增长十倍以上，设计队伍扩大了二十倍。
    据新华社重庆8日电　煤炭工业部重庆管理局矿井建设已提前一个月完成了第一个五年计划。到今年11月止，四川地区已有八对年产共三百一十六万吨的新井开工。
    第一个五年计划期间，四川地区煤矿发展极为迅速。由于重庆煤管局原有九对矿井大部分进行了改建和技术改造，产量已由1952年的一百一十二万吨提高到今年的二百四十一万吨（预计数），平均每年增长21.9％。但煤的产量仍不能满足四川地区日益增长的需要。因此，在第一个五年计划的后期开始了空前规模的矿井建设。建井力量是从无到有地发展起来的。目前已经组成了能担负年产三百多万吨矿井建设的施工队伍。地质和设计力量也迅速地发展。
    第一个五年计划，重庆煤管局的矿井建设主要集中四川地区的南桐矿区、嘉陵江两岸的华蓥山区和成渝铁路沿线的永荣矿区。第二个五年计划，不但这些矿区将有更大的发展，而且还要在云南和贵州高原开始现代化矿井的建设。
