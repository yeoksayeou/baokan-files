　　Taming the Mang River
　　By Our Correspondent Shang Kai
    "A Magic Sword to Suppress the Mang"
    Beneath the city of Jiyuan, Henan Province, over the rolling Mang River, stands an ancient, single-arched stone bridge. In the past, a bronze sword hung from the arch of this great stone bridge, its blade sharp and its cold light glinting, pointing directly at the river's heart. A myth of "A Magic Sword to Suppress the Mang" has been passed down here.
    The story originates from a folk legend: in remote antiquity, the Mang River was originally a python god in the heavenly palace. Because of his irritable temperament, he often violated the rules and was banished from the heavenly palace by the gods, who transformed him into the Mang River. The Mang River originates in Yangcheng County, Shanxi Province, on the southern edge of the Taihang Mountains, flows through Jiyuan, Meng County, and Wen County in Henan Province, and empties into the Yellow River in Wuzhi County. It is 130 kilometers long and is formed by the confluence of thirteen large and one hundred and sixty-five small streams. The people in the Mang River basin originally hoped that the Mang River would bring them blessings, but who knew that the Mang River's nature was difficult to change. Every flood season, it would stir up trouble, breach dikes, and overflow its banks. Generation after generation, countless villages and fields were submerged, and countless lives and properties were swallowed. People feared it like a python. Some say that since the Mang River is a large python, it is most afraid of swords. Therefore, people hung a bronze sword with a sharp blade under the arch of the Mang River Bridge, hoping to use this sharp sword to tame this wildly rampaging Mang River.
    The bronze sword on the Mang River Bridge merely expressed the urgent desire of the working people in the old society to harness the Mang River, but it could not tame it. Contrary to people's wishes, due to the destruction of forests and grasslands in the upper reaches, a large amount of soil and water was lost, and the downstream riverbed was silted up. When mountain torrents suddenly arrived, they could not be discharged smoothly, which made the Mang River become more and more ferocious year by year. According to local historical records, the floods in 1915, 1919, 1924, and 1939 alone destroyed more than 10,000 mu of fertile land, millions of houses, and countless utensils and property. After the floods came severe droughts. In 1942 and 1943, the ditches and rivers dried up, and the land was barren for thousands of miles. People along the river sold their wives and children, and finally, the tragedy of cannibalism occurred. A tragic ballad was circulated in the Mang River basin:
    "The Mang River water, long and long,
    Winding and twisting, all wrong;
    When it's dry, you drill underground,
    When it floods, you wash away land and houses;
    Drought brings no harvest, floods reduce production,
    Every year we suffer misery with you."
    Successive attacks of water and drought disasters led to a year-by-year decline in agricultural production, and the lives of the masses became even more miserable. In their own words, it was "bran in the morning, soup at noon, thin porridge by moonlight in the evening, and no cotton clothes to wear in winter." For thousands of years, the people in the Mang River basin have struggled in water and drought disasters year after year and day after day, groaning in hunger and cold.
    With the victory of the national people's revolution, the Mang River basin was also liberated. The Communist Party and the People's Government firmly grasped the masses' demands for harnessing the Mang River, put forward the call to march towards the Mang River, and reawakened the great people in the Mang River basin's beautiful hopes for the future. From then on, the myth of "A Magic Sword to Suppress the Mang" was shattered. People realized that to tame the Mang River, they could only rely on the leadership of the Communist Party and the strength of the people themselves. Thus, a massive mass movement to harness the Mang River unfolded on the 1,300 square kilometers of land in the Mang River basin. After years of hard work, the Mang River, which had been raging for thousands of years, has finally been tamed like a sheep and has begun to serve production and benefit the people.
    Everyone who comes to the Mang River basin is amazed by the local people's great achievements in harnessing the Mang River and asks the same question: "How was this rampaging Mang River tamed?" The best way to answer this question is to take a tour along the Mang River basin.
    Green Hills, Clear Water in Dry Gullies
    Leaving Jiyuan City and heading northwest along the Mang River for about thirty miles, you enter a mountainous area with undulating peaks, which is called the upper reaches of the Mang River. The further you go, the more excited you become. Look, the high and low ridges are covered with lush trees, occasionally dotted with a few persimmon trees as red as fire; on the hillsides far and near, the pasture is lush, and herds of cattle and sheep are moving slowly; at the foot of the mountains, the streams are gurgling, stirring up a layer of white waves on the pebbles... People can't help but exclaim: what a beautiful scene of southern China. But who could have imagined that three or five years ago, this was still a bare mountain? At that time, not to mention trees, even weeds were as sparse as scabs on a mangy head. Bare mountains could not retain soil and water. In times of drought, there was no water. In the event of heavy rain, mountain floods would erupt, and all the valleys would converge. The terraced fields on the hillsides were scoured into ravines, the rocks were exposed, the cultivated land was shrinking year by year, and the output was decreasing year by year, with an average yield of only about sixty catties per mu in normal years. Soil erosion brought untold disasters to the people!
    Now all this is in the past. According to Comrade Li Chuanqing, Deputy County Head of Jiyuan County, since 1949, more than 900,000 mu of barren mountains have been afforested in the upper reaches of the Mang River through methods such as closing mountains for afforestation and planting seedlings, accounting for more than 70% of the total area of barren mountains. This has played a great role in blocking floods, storing water, and reducing disasters in the downstream areas. This is very evident in the Tiger Ridge area. Tiger Ridge is the hometown of Cao Yongjian, a national model worker in forestry. Afforestation began here in 1949. Comrade Cao Yongjian led us into a mountain gully. Here, the trees were luxuriant and the shade was everywhere. In some places, people had to bend over or turn sideways to pass through. Many trees had grown into timber. Cao Yongjian pointed to the large stones tightly embedded between the tree trunks and said to us, "Did you see that? Before closing the mountains for afforestation, when it rained heavily, stones as big as cows rolled all over the mountains, which was really scary." Now the trees block the stones, the stones fix the mud and sand, there is green shade overhead, and there are fallen leaves and weeds to protect the slopes below. Soil erosion has completely stopped. According to the observation of the Water Conservancy Bureau of Jiyuan County, now there is no water under the forest when the daily rainfall is 30 mm, the water does not leave the slope when the daily rainfall is 50 mm, and clear water flows for a long time three days after the daily rainfall is 100 mm. More than fifty of the seventy large and small dry ditches in the Tiger Ridge area have become long-flowing streams. It is very convenient for the masses to build weirs, draw water for irrigation, cooking, washing clothes, and watering livestock. They praised, "Green hills, clear water in dry gullies." According to the personal experience of the masses, the mountain climate has also changed significantly. In the past, this mountainous area was either hit by heavy winds and torrential rains or suffered from long-term drought. Hail fell two out of three years. Since the trees grew on the mountains, the rain became more even, and hail disappeared altogether. The Tiger Ridge area has achieved a continuous three years of bumper harvests.
    Small Reservoirs, Treasures of the Mountains, Drought Resistance and Flood Prevention
    Standing on the Mang River levee and looking south, you can see a long ridge like a belt, stretching from northwest to southeast, which the local people call the South Ridge. Several of the larger tributaries of the Mang River originate on the ridge tops of this area. The South Ridge area belongs to the loess hilly area, with no trees or grasses, and ravines everywhere. Every autumn, mountain floods erupt, carrying mud and sand, pouring down and directly helping the Mang River to wreak havoc; once the flood season is over, there is a severe drought. The masses say that this is "nine droughts in ten years, and disasters every season."
    Now, the natural features of the South Ridge area have completely changed.
    Coming down from the Mang River levee and walking along any tributary of the Mang River towards the South Ridge, the first thing you will find is that the high ground on both sides of the riverbed has been transformed into furrowed fields with crisscrossing channels. "Where did this water come from?" Let's not worry about it for now. Continuing forward for not too far, you will be faced with a dam blocking the way. Climbing to the top of the dam, a pond of calm autumn water suddenly appears before your eyes. White ducks swim gently across the surface of the water, the reflection of the South Ridge trembles slightly, and occasionally, a fish floats to the surface where the waves turn, and then suddenly plunges into the bottom of the water. Unexpectedly, there is such a landscape in this loess hilly area. This is a small reservoir built by the local people themselves. Bypassing this reservoir and continuing forward, you will find a second, a third, and even a fourth and a fifth similar small reservoir. The masses call this a reservoir group. Each small reservoir stores about 100,000 to 150,000 cubic meters of water, and a water discharge culvert is buried at the bottom of the dam, which can be used to release water for irrigation at any time. The furrowed fields you saw just now are irrigated with the water from the reservoir. According to Comrade Shang Fengtian, Deputy Secretary of the Jiyuan County Party Committee, the characteristics of this small reservoir are: small investment, quick results, less labor, and easy for the masses to build, which is an effective measure to block floods, develop upstream irrigation, and reduce downstream water damage.
    Now, sixty such small reservoirs have been built on the thirteen larger tributaries north and south of the Mang River, forming many reservoir groups, which can block more than 7.4 million cubic meters of floodwater, which can control one-third of the flow of the Mang River during the flood season. This not only greatly alleviates the flood damage in the downstream of the Mang River, but also makes it possible to irrigate many high grounds on the ridges, changing the drought-stricken face of thousands of years, and making the production and life of the masses achieve a leap forward. In the Nan Yao Agricultural Cooperative in the upper reaches of the Shipan River, a tributary of the Mang River, there are a total of 620 households. Before the construction of the reservoir, in addition to a few brick wells more than ten feet deep for drinking water, the cooperative's more than 5,900 mu of ridge slopes had no irrigation conditions at all, and were often threatened by drought. At that time, the tragic ballad "Nan Yao Village, broken beach, nine disasters in ten years, people starving" was circulating. Since the construction of three small reservoirs in 1953, 90% of the ridge slopes can be irrigated, dry land has become paddy fields, single cropping has become double cropping, and the total grain output of the cooperative has increased from 900,000 catties to 2,180,000 catties, and the historically grain-deficient village has become a surplus-grain village. The masses sang at the celebration of the harvest: "Small reservoirs, treasures of the mountains, drought resistance and flood prevention are really good; since the reservoir group was built, Nan Yao has become a treasure bowl." Now, the Nan Yao Agricultural Cooperative is planning to use the reservoir to raise a large number of fish and ducks and grow rice next year. When we left here, Comrade Wang Jinghong, director of the cooperative, especially instructed us to come back next year, saying, "At that time, our poor mountains and barren ridges will become a land of fish and rice in southern China."

　　驯服漭河
　　本报记者　商恺
    “宝剑镇漭”
    河南省济源城下，滚滚东去的漭河上，架有一座古老的独拱大石桥。从前，这座大石桥的拱顶下面，悬有一口青铜宝剑，剑锋犀利，冷光闪闪，直刺河心。这里流传着一个“宝剑镇漭”的神话故事。
    故事来源于民间的传说：在遥远的古代，漭河原是天宫里的一位蟒神，因为他性情暴躁，常常触规犯律，被天神逐出了天宫，将他变成了这条漭河。漭河发源于太行山南麓的山西省阳城县境，流经河南省的济源、孟县、温县，到武陟县注入黄河，全长一百三十公里，由十三条大沟、一百六十五条小沟汇合而成。漭河流域的人们，原希望漭河能为他们造福，谁知道漭河秉性难移，每到汛期，便兴风作浪，溃堤泛滥，世世代代，不知被它淹没了多少村庄田园，吞噬了多少生命财产，人们畏之如蛇蟒。有人说，漭河既然是条大蟒，那么蟒是最怕剑的。于是，人们便在漭河大石桥的拱顶下面，悬挂了一口青铜宝剑，希图借助这口犀利的宝剑，来驯服这条疯狂暴跳的漭河。
    漭河大桥上的青铜宝剑，仅仅表示了旧社会劳动人民对治理漭河的迫切愿望，但是却无法驯服漭河。和人们的愿望相反，由于上游的林木草坡遭到了破坏，水土大量流失，下游河床被淤浅，山洪骤至，宣泄不畅，这就使漭河一年比一年变得更加凶暴起来。据当地史料记载，仅1915年、1919年、1924年、1939年等几次较大的洪水，即冲毁良田万余亩，房屋千万间，各种器皿财物，漂没无算。大水之后，便是大旱。1942年和1943年，沟干河涸，赤地千里。沿河人民卖妻子，卖儿女，最后出现了人吃人的惨剧。漭河流域曾流传着一首悲惨的歌谣：
    “漭河水，长又长，
    弯弯曲曲不像样；
    天旱你往地下钻，
    天涝冲地又冲房；
    旱不收，涝减产，
    年年跟你受凄惶。”
    水旱灾害连续袭击，农业生产逐年下降，群众生活也就更为悲惨了。用他们自己的话来形容，那就是“早上糠，中午汤，晚上稀饭照月亮，冬天穿不上棉衣裳”。千百年来，漭河流域的人们，就是这样年复一年、日复一日地在水旱灾害中挣扎着，在饥寒交迫中呻吟着。
    随着全国人民革命的胜利，漭河流域也获得了解放。共产党和人民政府，紧紧地抓住了群众的治漭要求，提出了向漭河进军的号召，重新唤起了漭河流域广大人民对未来生活的美好希望。从此，“宝剑镇漭”的神话故事破灭了，人们认识到，要驯服漭河，只有依靠共产党的领导和人民自己的力量。于是，一个声势浩大的群众性的治漭运动，在漭河流域一千三百平方公里的土地上展开了。经过连年奋战，目前这条疯狂暴跳了几千年的漭河，终于像只绵羊似的乖乖地驯服了，开始为生产服务，为人们造福。
    凡是到漭河流域来的人们，无不惊异当地人民治理漭河的巨大成就，都提出了同样的问题：“这疯狂成性的漭河，是怎样被驯服了的？”解答这个问题的最好办法，是沿漭河流域作一次参观旅行。
    绿了荒山头，干沟清水流
    出济源城，溯漭河西北行，约三十里，便进入了峰峦起伏的山岳地带，所谓漭河上游便是指的这里。从这里越往前走，越令人感到兴奋，看吧，高高低低的岭岗上，都布满了蓊郁的林木，偶尔有几棵红得像火一样的柿子树，点缀其间；远远近近的山坡上，牧草丰美，成群的牛羊正在缓缓移动；山脚下，溪水淙淙，在鹅卵石上激起了一层白色的浪花……人们不由得要赞叹一声：好一片江南景色。可是，谁能想像到三五年前，这里还是一片光山秃岭啊！那时候，不要说林木，就是蒿草都稀少得像癞痢头上的癞发一样。光山秃岭不能保持水土，平时干旱无水，一遇暴雨，则山洪暴发，万谷并流，山坡梯田被冲刷得沟壑纵横，岩石裸露，耕地逐年缩小，产量逐年降低，平常年景每亩仅能收六十斤左右。水土流失不知给人们带来了多少灾难！
    现在这一切都成过去了。据济源县副县长李传清同志介绍：从1949年以来，在漭河上游通过封山抚育和播种栽植等方法，已经绿化荒山九十余万亩，占荒山总面积的70％以上，这对拦洪蓄水，减少下游灾害，发挥了很大的作用。这在虎岭一带表现的非常显著。虎岭是全国林业劳动模范曹永健的家乡，这里从1949年便开始封山造林。曹永健同志把我们带进了一条山沟里，这里林木繁茂，绿荫处处，有些地方，人们必须弯着腰或侧着身子，才能穿过去，许多树木已经长大成材。曹永健指着紧紧嵌在树干之间的大石块对我们说：“看见了吗？在封山育林以前，下大雨的时候，像牛这么大的石头，被冲得满山乱滚，真吓死人。”现在树木挡住了石头，石头固定了泥砂，上面有绿荫遮天，下面有落叶和杂草护坡，水土流失已经完全停止了。据济源县水利局的观测：现在日降雨三十公厘，林下不见水，日降雨五十公厘，水已不出坡，日降雨一百公厘，三日后清水长流。虎岭一带共有大小干沟七十多条，已有五十多条变成了长流水。群众节节打堰，引水浇地、做饭、洗衣、饮牲口都非常方便。他们赞美道：“绿了荒山头，干沟清水流。”根据群众亲身的体会，山区气候也发生了显著的变化，过去，这一带山区里，不是恶风暴雨，便是长期干旱，三年有两年下冰雹。自从山上长起林木，却变得雨水调匀，冰雹更是不见了，虎岭一带已经获得连续三年的丰收。
    小水库，山地宝，抗旱又防涝
    登上漭河大堤，举目南望，只见有一长岭如带，从西北往东南迤逦而去，当地群众称它为南岭。漭河的几条较大的支流就发源在这一带的岭巅上。南岭一带，属于黄土丘陵区，既无林木，又无水草，到处沟壑纵横。年年秋季山洪暴发，挟泥带沙，一倾而下，直助漭河为虐；汛期一过，接着又是大旱。群众说这里是“十年九旱，季季有灾。”
    现在，南岭一带的自然面貌已经完全改变了。
    走下漭河大堤，随便沿着漭河的任何一条支流向着南岭走去，首先发现的便是河床两岸的岭坡高地，都变成了渠道纵横的畦田。“这是哪里来的水呢？”暂且不去管它吧。继续往前走不了多远，迎面出现一条拦河坝，挡住了去路。登上坝顶，一塘平明如镜的秋水，突然展现在眼前。白色的鸭群轻轻地在水面上泅过，南岭的倒影颤颤欲动，偶尔浪花翻处，一只鱼儿浮到水面，又猛地钻进了水底。想不到，在这黄土丘陵地带，会有这样一片湖光山色。这就是当地群众自己动手修筑的小型水库。绕过这座水库，继续往前走，还会出现第二座、第三座以及第四座、第五座同样的小水库。群众称这为水库群。每座小水库大约蓄水十万到十五万方，坝底埋有泄水涵管，可以随时放水浇田。刚才看到的畦田，便是用水库的水浇灌的。据中共济源县委副书记尚风田同志给我们介绍，这种小型水库的特点是：投资小，收效快，费工少，群众容易举办，是拦蓄洪水，发展上游灌溉，减少下游水害的有效措施。
    现在，在漭河南北十三条较大的支流上，已经修建了六十座这样的小型水库，组成了许多水库群，共能拦蓄洪水七百四十多万方，可以控制漭河流域汛期三分之一的流量。这不仅大大地减轻了漭河下游的洪害，而且使许多岭坡高地都可以引水灌溉，改变了千百年来的干旱面貌，使群众的生产和生活获得了飞跃的发展。在漭河支流石盘河的上游的南姚农业社，共有社员六百二十户。在修建水库以前，这里除了有几眼十几丈深的砖井供人吃水以外，全社五千九百多亩岗坡高地，根本没有灌溉条件，经常受着干旱的威胁。当时流传着“南姚村，破烂滩，十年九灾人饿翻”的悲惨歌谣。自从1953年修起三座小型水库以后，90％的岭坡高地都能引水灌溉，旱田变成了水田，单作变成了双作，全社粮食总产量由九十万斤提高到了二百一十八万斤，历史上的缺粮村变成了余粮村。群众在庆祝丰收的大会上唱道：“小水库，山地宝，抗旱防涝真正好；自从修了水库群，南姚变成了聚宝盆。”现在，南姚农业社正计划明年利用水库大量地养鱼养鸭和栽种水稻。当我们离开这里的时候，社主任王经宏同志特别嘱咐我们到明年这个时候再来，他说，“那时候，我们这穷山秃岭的地方，就变成江南的鱼米之乡了。”
