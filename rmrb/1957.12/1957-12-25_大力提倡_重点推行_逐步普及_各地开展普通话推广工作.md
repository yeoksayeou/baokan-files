    Vigorously Advocate, Focus on Promotion, Gradually Popularize
    Various Regions Carry Out Mandarin Promotion Work
    This newspaper reports that since the Ministry of Education issued the "Notice on Continuing to Promote Mandarin" on August 21 this year, the vast majority of provincial and municipal education administrative departments across the country have reversed their previous state of insufficient attention to the work of promoting Mandarin. Some prefectural, county, and municipal education administrative departments have also assigned cadres to concurrently manage Mandarin promotion work, actively implementing the policy of "Vigorously advocate, focus on promotion, and gradually popularize," making the promotion of Mandarin a regular task.
    Shanghai, Qinghai, Sichuan, Shandong, Hubei, Hunan, and Guangdong, among other provinces and cities, have determined to further deepen the work of promoting Mandarin and have specifically arranged future tasks. Jingjiang County in Jiangsu Province held a Mandarin promotion work conference, and the Guangzhou Municipal Mandarin Promotion Work Committee also held a meeting of all its members to study how to further strengthen the promotion of Mandarin in light of the city's specific circumstances. During the summer vacation, Shanghai successively held six summer vacation Mandarin training classes for kindergarten teachers and caregivers in eighteen districts, with a total of more than 1,500 participants. After eight to ten days of study, most trainees could correctly pronounce the marked syllables formed by phonetic letters and could use phonetic letters to practice Mandarin. The Shandong Provincial Department of Education held a "Mandarin Phonetics Research Class" at the Provincial Teachers' Continuing Education College, training teachers in rotation to continue to cultivate the backbone of Mandarin promotion in various counties and cities of the province. Overall, the work of promoting Mandarin in various parts of the country has generally shifted from being sporadic to being regular. However, there are also individual provincial and municipal education administrative departments that, due to being busy with other work, have not truly paid attention to the work of promoting Mandarin and are still in a state of stagnation. This needs to be changed.
    The dialect survey work is being actively carried out in various provinces and cities. Except for Jiangsu, Nanjing, Liaoning, and other provinces and cities that have basically completed the preliminary dialect survey work, it is generally expected to be completed before the end of this year. Only a few provinces and cities, such as Fujian and Gansu, need to be extended to 1958. The Hebei Provincial Dialect Survey Work Steering Group held its second meeting on November 23 and 24 to discuss how to further sort out materials and compile a language learning manual, among other issues.
    In order to consider the issue of promoting phonetic letters in primary and secondary schools starting in the autumn of next year, the Chinese Writing Reform Committee and the Ministry of Education convened a forum on October 30 with the participation of directors of education departments and bureaus from two cities (Beijing, Tianjin) and one province (Shandong), as well as teachers from some primary and secondary schools and normal schools in Beijing. During the forum, most people believed that the promotion of phonetic letters would not be a major problem in secondary schools and normal schools, and that it could be promoted with emphasis in primary schools with suitable conditions.
    The film "Let's All Speak Mandarin," co-produced by the Chinese Writing Reform Committee and the Ministry of Education with the assistance of the Shanghai Science and Education Film Studio, has been printed with 106 copies and distributed by the China Film Distribution and Exhibition Corporation for screening across the country.

### 大力提倡　重点推行　逐步普及  各地开展普通话推广工作

    大力提倡　重点推行　逐步普及
    各地开展普通话推广工作
    本报讯　从今年8月21日教育部发出“关于继续推广普通话的通知”以来，全国绝大多数的省、市教育行政部门都扭转了对推广普通话工作重视不够的状态，有些省份的专署、县、市教育行政部门也指派干部兼管普通话推广工作，积极贯彻“大力提倡，重点推行，逐步普及”的方针，使推广普通话成为经常工作。
    上海、青海、四川、山东、湖北、湖南、四川、广东等省、市，确定进一步深入开展推广普通话工作，具体地布置了今后的任务。江苏靖江县召开了推广普通话工作会议，广州市推广普通话工作委员会也召开了全体委员会议，研究如何结合该市具体情况进一步加强普通话推广工作。上海市在暑假期间，先后在闸北等十八个区分块联合举办了六个暑期幼儿园教养员普通话训练班，参加学习的共一千五百多人。经过八到十天的学习，大多数学员看到用拼音字母拼成的标调音节，就能正确发音，并可以运用拼音字母练习普通话。山东省教育厅在省教师进修学院举办了“普通话语音研究班”，轮流训练教师，继续为该省各县、市培养推广普通话的骨干。总的看来，全国各地的普通话推广工作，一般都由忽热忽冷转入经常化。但也有个别省市的教育行政部门，由于忙于其它工作，对推广普通话工作还没有真正地重视起来，还处于停滞不前的状态。这是需要改变的。
    方言普查工作，各省市在积极进行中，除江苏、南京、辽宁等省市已经基本上完成方言初步普查工作外，一般都预计在今年年底以前完成。只有福建、甘肃几个省市须延至1958年。河北省方言调查工作指导组在11月23、24日召开了第二次会议，讨论了如何进一步整理材料编写学话手册等问题。
    中国文字改革委员会和教育部为了考虑明年秋季开始在中小学中推行拼音字母问题，曾在10月30日召开了有二市（北京、天津）一省（山东）教育厅局长及北京市部分中、小学和师范学校教师参加的座谈会，座谈中多数人认为：拼音字母的推行，在中学、师范学校问题不大，小学可以有重点的在有条件的学校推行。
    中国文字改革委员会和教育部协助上海科学教育电影制片厂摄制的“大家来说普通话”电影，已经印制了一百零六个拷贝，由中国电影发行总公司分发到全国各地上映。
