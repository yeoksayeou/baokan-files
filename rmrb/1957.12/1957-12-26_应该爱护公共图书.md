    Public Books Should Be Cherished
    Recently, I went to the Shanghai Library's reading room several times to consult newspaper editorials, but I discovered an intolerable bad phenomenon of harming public interests for personal gain. I borrowed the October issues of the People's Daily several times and found that several days' worth of newspapers were missing. Some newspapers had been torn, the words were blurred, and one even had a small hole cut out of it, because a picture was missing. This year in April and May, when I was in Beijing, I sometimes went to the Beijing Library's reading room to read magazines and newspapers, and I often found this situation as well. Although this is only done by a very small number of people, this despicable behavior of harming public interests for personal gain seriously hinders the convenience of the majority of readers. Therefore, I suggest that all public libraries should strengthen publicity work and educate readers to cherish public books. Those who damage public books should be dealt with seriously, so that these immoral people can disappear from our new society.

    应该爱护公共图书
    最近我多次去上海市图书馆阅览室查阅报纸社论，却发现一种令人不能容忍的损公利己的坏现象。我借了几次10月份的人民日报，发现里面竟缺了好几天的报纸，有的报纸已被撕破，字迹模糊不清，甚至有一张被开了一个小小的天窗，原来是一张图片不翼而飞了。今年4、5月我在北京时，有时去北京图书馆阅览室看杂志和报纸，也经常发现这种情形。这虽然是极个别的人干的事，但这种损公利己的卑鄙行为，却严重地妨碍了广大读者阅读的便利。因此，我建议各公共图书馆要加强宣传工作，教育读者爱护公共图书。对破坏公共图书的人，要严肃地进行处理，这样才能使这种不道德的人在我们的新社会里销声匿迹。
