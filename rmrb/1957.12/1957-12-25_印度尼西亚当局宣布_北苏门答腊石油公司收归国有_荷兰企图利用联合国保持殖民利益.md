Xinhua News Agency Comprehensive Report: Jakarta News: Indonesian authorities have formally announced that the North Sumatra Oil Company is a state-owned enterprise. It was previously reported that the Indonesian government decided in July of this year to place the North Sumatra oil field under the management of the Army Chief of Staff. After the outbreak of World War II, the former Dutch owner of this oil field fled. After Indonesia's independence in 1945, Indonesian workers and experts were responsible for restoring production at the oil field. However, the issue of company ownership had never been resolved.

Hague News: Dutch Foreign Minister Luns stated in the Second Chamber of the Dutch Parliament on the 23rd that he would use the United Nations to interfere in Indonesia's struggle to recover West Irian. Luns, adopting the guise of an outdated colonizer, smeared Indonesia's actions against Dutch companies as "violations of international law." He also insisted that the situation in Indonesia had "seriously deteriorated" in the past three weeks. He expressed satisfaction that the NATO Paris conference had expressed "concern" about the situation in Indonesia. Luns also stated that Indonesia's determination of the waters between Indonesian islands as territorial waters was "unacceptable." He said that the Netherlands would contact the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom to issue a joint statement on the matter.

New York News: The Netherlands' chief representative to the United Nations, Schuurman, handed a letter to the United Nations on the 23rd, expressing "protest" against Indonesia's actions to regain West Irian. The Dutch government is attempting to shift the responsibility for the situation caused by its occupation of West Irian and wants to use the United Nations for intervention.

    印度尼西亚当局宣布
    北苏门答腊石油公司收归国有
    荷兰企图利用联合国保持殖民利益
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：雅加达消息：印度尼西亚当局已经正式宣布北苏门答腊石油公司是国营企业。以前曾经报道，印度尼西亚政府在今年7月间决定把北苏门答腊石油矿交由陆军参谋长管理。在第二次世界大战爆发以后，这个油矿以前的荷兰业主逃跑了。1945年印度尼西亚独立之后，这个油矿就由印度尼西亚工人和专家负责恢复了生产。但是，公司的所有权问题一直没有解决。
    海牙消息：荷兰外交大臣伦斯23日在荷兰议会第二院表示要利用联合国来干涉印度尼西亚的收复西伊里安的斗争。伦斯摆出已经过了时的殖民者的架子，把印度尼西亚对荷兰企业采取的行动污蔑为“违反国际法”，他还硬说印度尼西亚国内的情况在过去三个星期间已经“十分严重地恶化”。他对于北大西洋公约组织巴黎会议表示“关心”印度尼西亚国内的事情这一点表示满意。伦斯对于印度尼西亚确定印度尼西亚各岛之间的海域为领海这一点也表示“不能接受”。他说，荷兰将同美国、澳大利亚和英国接洽，以便就这件事发表一项联合声明。
    纽约消息：荷兰驻联合国的首席代表舒尔曼23日把一封信交给联合国，表示“抗议”印度尼西亚为了争取收复西伊里安而采取的行动。荷兰政府企图借此转移它对侵占西伊里安所造成的局势应负的责任，并想利用联合国进行干涉。
