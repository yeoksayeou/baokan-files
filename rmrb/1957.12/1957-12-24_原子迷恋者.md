    Atomic Fanatic
    West German Chancellor Adenauer openly opposed the Soviet proposal to establish a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe, calling it a "fantasy."
    Here, Adenauer once again demonstrated that he is very active in the cause of opposing peace. He is the first head of government of a Western country to publicly express opposition to the establishment of a Central European nuclear-free zone.
    The Soviet Union's peaceful proposal is entirely realistic and has been supported by public opinion in many European countries, including West Germany. As long as West Germany, the United States, and Britain can take a positive attitude on this issue, then the realization of this proposal is entirely possible.
    Adenauer insisted that this proposal was a "fantasy," which precisely shows that Adenauer is a fanatic who dreams day and night of American missiles and atomic weapons.

    原子迷恋者
    西德总理阿登纳公然反对苏联提出的关于在中欧建立一个无原子区的建议，他认为那是一个“幻想”。
    在这里，阿登纳又一次表现了他在反对和平的事业上是十分积极的。他是西方国家政府首脑对建立中欧无原子区的问题第一个公开表示反对的人。
    苏联的这个和平建议，是完全有实现的现实前提的，它已得到欧洲许多国家、包括西德的舆论的支持。只要西德和美英在这个问题上能够采取积极的态度，那么，实现这个建议便是完全可能的。
    阿登纳硬说这个建议是个“幻想”，这正表明阿登纳是个日夜在梦想着美国导弹和原子武器的迷恋者。
