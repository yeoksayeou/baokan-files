　　Running People's Hospitals Diligently and Thriftily

With the restoration and development of the national economy, the hospital system across the country has also greatly developed and improved. There are now more than 4,000 hospitals and more than 276,000 beds nationwide, an increase of nearly four times compared to the highest year before liberation. The ranks of hospital workers across the country are also growing day by day. To date, there are more than 300,000 hospital staff nationwide. Based on the principle of hospitals serving the people and serving production, hospitals have not only developed in cities and coastal areas, but have also greatly developed and improved in industrial and mining enterprises, rural areas, and minority areas. Over the past few years, hospitals across the country have completed arduous medical tasks. In 1956 alone, they completed diagnoses and treatments for more than 300 million outpatient visits and more than 5 million inpatients. They also organized medical staff to go deep into factories, rural areas, and border areas to conduct investigations and research on the prevention and treatment of common diseases, endemic diseases, and occupational diseases, thereby cooperating with industrial and agricultural production. The quality of medical care and work efficiency in hospitals are also constantly improving, and various systems are becoming increasingly完善 reasonable. In recent years, all localities have led the absorption of more than 20,000 traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to participate in hospital work, which has played a positive role in treating diseases, creating favorable conditions for the unity of Chinese and Western medicine, inheriting the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine, and summarizing the experiences of traditional Chinese medicine. Hospitals in various places have done some work in running hospitals diligently and thriftily, and have achieved certain results. At present, many hospitals across the country have formulated many sound systems to save medicines and equipment and overcome waste, saving a lot of resources for the country. The achievement of these results is due to the correct leadership of the Party, the increased political awareness and efforts of all hospital staff, and also the study of advanced Soviet experiences.

The development of our hospitals is huge, and the achievements are the main aspect. However, this does not mean that our hospitals have no problems. Our hospitals are a part of the socialist cause, and they must serve the people wholeheartedly and implement the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily and running all undertakings diligently and thriftily. Measuring our hospitals with this yardstick, we will find that some of the hospital's work systems, equipment, and work styles still violate the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily. Some hospitals, when stipulating certain systems, do not proceed from the perspective of making it convenient for patients, but from the perspective of making it convenient for themselves. For example, the outpatient clinics of some hospitals are "bureaucratized," and many hospitals only have half-day outpatient clinics. Hospitals emphasize handling matters according to "routine" and make many unreasonable regulations for patients. Some hospitals have stipulated many unreasonable conditions for patients' admission, preventing patients from receiving early treatment. Some hospitals blindly pursue so-called "modernization" in basic construction and internal equipment, emphasizing "ostentation" and "beauty." The Ministry of Health has counted the investment in 10,000 beds in newly built general hospitals in 17 provinces and cities, and the results all exceeded the national standards. Some people one-sidedly emphasize treatment requirements, unreasonably abuse valuable medicinal materials without considering the patient's condition needs, or perform some unnecessary examinations on patients, causing great waste. Hebei Province used more than 4,000 catties of ginseng in 1956; a staff hospital in Taiyuan used 867 ampoules of oil-based penicillin and 27,120 ampoules of water-based penicillin from January to September this year. There are also many unreasonable phenomena in the staffing of hospitals. There are too many administrative and support personnel, and technical personnel are used improperly. Some medical personnel still exhibit irresponsibility in their medical work style.

What do these problems in hospitals illustrate? This shows that we have not completely resolved the fundamental issue of wholeheartedly serving the people, and the policy of running hospitals diligently and thriftily has not been well implemented.

In order to thoroughly solve this fundamental ideological problem and policy issue, we must recognize that the emergence of these problems has its roots. From the so-called "nursing homes" and "Anji homes" and other medical organizations in the Tang and Song dynasties, to the period of reactionary rule by the Kuomintang, China's hospitals, whether they were government-run, private-run, church-run, or run by "charitable" organizations, all served a small number of people. After liberation, the ranks of hospital workers have greatly developed, and the political thinking of medical workers has also greatly improved. However, we cannot fail to see that many people in the hospital workforce have, on the one hand, accepted the bad influences of the old hospitals, and on the other hand, most of them come from the exploiting classes, despise labor, and despise the people. Among these people, there is more or less the thinking and medical style of the bourgeoisie. Therefore, the fundamental idea of serving the people wholeheartedly, which our Party insists on, is still incompatible with some people. The bourgeois thinking and style of these people have an impact on various aspects of hospital work. In this way, in the issue of running hospitals, there are actually two ideologies, two paths, and two styles in hospitals. We firmly advocate that hospitals must face the people, face production, and run hospitals diligently and thriftily. All our organizational systems, regulations, construction, etc. must be based on these principles. On the contrary, some people in our hospital ranks do not agree with these principles. They apply the bourgeois approach of running hospitals in the old society to people's hospitals. All considerations are not based on facilitating the people and serving the people, but on facilitating themselves; they actually disagree with the policy of running hospitals diligently and thriftily, and blindly seek novelty, completeness, largeness, and height in hospital construction. Judging from the problems exposed in the anti-rightist and rectification movements, and from the examples cited above, the problems in hospital work also involve the struggle between proletarian ideology and bourgeois ideology. We must adhere to proletarian ideology and oppose bourgeois ideology. This is the fundamental issue in improving hospital work.

What is our standard for running hospitals? This is to serve the people wholeheartedly and run hospitals diligently and thriftily. All the work of our hospitals should be measured by this standard; medical systems should be reformed and the level of professional skills should be improved according to this standard. Why do we adhere to this standard? That is because our hospital is socialist and belongs to the people. Therefore, serving the people is its inherent nature and the starting point and purpose of all work. Hospitals with such a nature must adhere to the policy of running hospitals diligently and thriftily. Running hospitals diligently and thriftily can be said to be a sign of the socialist nature of our hospitals and a major distinction between our hospitals and those in old China. Facts have proven that whichever hospital has a high cure rate for diseases, works diligently and thriftily in all its work, and has systems and regulations that facilitate patients, that hospital is welcomed by the people; otherwise, the people will not welcome it.

Our emphasis on running hospitals diligently and thriftily does not mean that hospitals should not have any necessary medical equipment and medicines, nor does it mean that running hospitals diligently and thriftily can affect the improvement of medical quality, nor should it be considered that running hospitals diligently and thriftily will reduce the level of medical science and technology. Diligence means being diligent and serving the people wholeheartedly; thrift means being thrifty. When we say to run hospitals diligently and thriftily, we should not only oppose extravagance and waste and practice strict economy in terms of manpower and material resources, and oppose carelessness and irresponsibility in the medical style; but also we should try our best to improve the quality of medical care, solve all necessary and possible medical equipment and equipment, and make full use of all our existing equipment to actively tap potential, so that patients can receive technically excellent and economical treatment. Therefore, our policy of running hospitals diligently and thriftily is consistent with improving the quality of medical care and technical level, and is not contradictory.

In order to run our hospitals well in accordance with the standard of running hospitals diligently and thriftily and serving the people, we must first strengthen the leadership of the Party, strengthen political and ideological education, rectify the ranks of hospital workers, and mobilize the masses to speak out freely, expose all wrong ideas and styles,展开 debate, and establish the idea and style of running hospitals diligently and thriftily and serving the people. Hospitals are places where intellectuals are concentrated. It is very important to do a good job in the ideological transformation of intellectuals in hospitals. Party committees at all levels must pay great attention to this work.

In order to resolutely implement the policy of running hospitals diligently and thriftily, it is necessary to overcome waste, lower the standards of basic construction, equipment, and patient meals in hospitals in the future, improve the financial management of hospitals, rectify institutions, streamline administrative support personnel according to the situation, and change the current situation of overly detailed hospital departments and wasted manpower. It can be said with certainty that our hospitals currently have potential to be realized in terms of manpower, material resources, and financial resources. As long as the ideological problems are solved and the masses are mobilized, a new atmosphere will surely emerge. In order to facilitate patients' access to medical treatment and benefit production, hospitals in various places should promote the three-shift outpatient system in accordance with local conditions and time, and fully tap the potential of hospital personnel and equipment. County and district medical institutions can adopt methods such as seeing patients as they come, providing door-to-door medical services, and conducting mobile medical services, depending on the characteristics of rural production. In short, all medical institutions must arrange their work according to the principles of diligence and thrift and facilitating patients' access to medical treatment. In the future, the establishment of simple beds in urban and rural hospitals is a major measure that we have proposed based on the 600 million people and the economic conditions and living standards of our country. Simple beds are a form that will be needed for a long time to come, not only in rural areas, but also in cities, and not only can grassroots organizations run them, but also large hospitals and teaching hospitals can run them. Various localities can take different forms to set them up according to the situation.

In order to implement the policy of running hospitals diligently and thriftily and serving the people, it is necessary to expand prevention and implement the idea of prevention first in China's health work. Medical personnel should go deep among the masses to carry out publicity work to enable them to master the knowledge of disease prevention and guide them to carry out the Patriotic Health Campaign, so as to achieve the goal of preventing and eliminating diseases.

In order to implement the policy of running hospitals diligently and thriftily and serving the people, it is necessary to further implement the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine, give full play to the role of traditional Chinese medicine in preventing and treating diseases, enhance the unity of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, and reverse the phenomenon of not valuing traditional Chinese medicine ideologically.

Our slogan is: Establish a medical attitude of serving the people wholeheartedly and run hospitals diligently and thriftily. Under the leadership of the Party, hospital workers across the country must follow the policies prescribed by the Party for hospitals, strengthen ideological transformation, improve political awareness, and run people's hospitals diligently and thriftily.

　　勤俭办好人民的医院
    随着国民经济的恢复和发展，全国医院事业也有很大的发展和提高。现在全国有四千余所医院，二十七万六千余张病床，比解放前的最高年度增加了近四倍。全国医院工作的队伍也在一天天的壮大起来，到目前为止，全国已有医院工作人员三十多万。根据医院面向人民、面向生产的方针，医院不仅在城市和沿海地区有了发展，而且在工矿、企业、农村和少数民族地区也有了很大的发展和提高。全国各地医院几年来完成了繁重的医疗任务，只1956年一年，就完成了三亿多人次的门诊和五百多万住院病人的诊断和治疗，并且组织了医务人员深入工厂、农村和边疆，进行了多发病、地方病与职业病的调查研究和防治工作，从而配合了工农业生产。医院中的医疗质量和工作效率也在不断的提高，各种制度也在日益完善合理。几年来各地有领导地吸收了二万多中医参加了医院工作，在医治疾病方面起了良好的作用，对中西医团结，继承祖国医学遗产，总结中医经验创造了有利条件。各地医院在勤俭办医院方面做了一些工作，取得了一定成绩。现在全国很多医院为了节省药品器材，克服浪费，制定了很多良好的制度，为国家节省了大量资财。这些成绩的获得，是因为有了党的正确领导，是因为医院全体工作人员的政治觉悟的提高和努力，同时也是因为学习了苏联的先进经验。
    我们医院的发展是巨大的，成绩是主要的。但是这并不是说我们的医院就没有问题了。我们的医院是社会主义事业的一部分，它必须全心全意为人民服务，必须贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭办一切事业的方针。用这个尺度去衡量一下我们的医院，就会发现医院工作的一些制度上、设备上、工作作风上还有违背勤俭建国的方针的。有些医院在规定某些制度时，不是从一切为了病人方便出发，而有为了自己方便出发的观点，如一些医院的门诊“机关化”，有不少医院只有半天门诊，医院中强调按“常规”办事，而对病人作了很多不合理的规定。有些医院对病人入院规定了许多不合理的条件，致使病人不能得到早期治疗。有些医院在基本建设和内部设备上盲目追求什么“现代化”，讲究“排场”、“漂亮”。卫生部统计了十七个省、市新建综合医院的一万张病床的投资，结果都高出了国家规定的标准。有些人片面强调治疗要求，不根据病人的病情需要，不合理地滥用贵重药材，或对病人作一些不必要的检查，造成了很大的浪费。河北省在1956年共用人参达四千多斤；太原一个职工医院在今年1—9月份就用了油剂盘尼西林八百六十七支、水剂盘尼西林二万七千一百二十支。医院的编制上也有不少不合理的现象。行政、勤杂人员过多，技术人员使用不当。某些医务人员的医疗作风上还存在不负责任的现象。
    医院中存在的这些问题说明了什么呢？这说明了我们在全心全意为人民服务这个根本问题上还没有彻底解决，勤俭办院的方针还没有很好的贯彻。
    为了彻底解决这个根本思想问题和方针问题，我们必须认识到这些问题的产生是有其根源的。从唐宋时代的所谓“养病坊”、“安济坊”等医疗组织开始，到国民党反动统治时期，我国的医院不论是官办的、私办的、教会办的、“慈善”机关办的，无一不是为少数人服务的。解放之后，医院工作队伍有了很大的发展，医务工作人员的政治思想也有了很大的进步，但是我们不能不看到，医院工作队伍中有很多人一方面接受了旧医院的不良的影响，另一方面他们中的多数人出身于剥削阶级，轻视劳动、轻视人民，在这些人中间或多或少地存在资产阶级的思想和医疗作风。因此，我们党所坚持的为人民服务的根本思想，对某些人来讲还是格格不入的。这些人的资产阶级的思想作风，在医院的各项工作中发生影响。这样，在办医院问题上，实际上在医院中存在着两种思想、两条道路、两种作风。我们坚决主张医院必须面向人民、面向生产、勤俭办院。我们的一切组织制度、规定、建设等必须根据这些原则。与此相反，我们的医院队伍中有些人不同意这些原则。他们把旧社会的资产阶级的办医院的一套用在人民医院上面，一切考虑不是从便利于人民为人民服务出发，而是从便利于自己出发；他们实际上不同意勤俭办医院的方针，在医院建设上盲目地求新、求全、求大、求高。从反右派中和整风运动中暴露出来的问题来看，从前面所举的一些例子来看，在医院工作中的问题，也存在着无产阶级思想和资产阶级思想的斗争。我们必须坚持无产阶级的思想，反对资产阶级的思想。这是改进医院工作的根本问题。
    我们办医院的标准是什么呢？这就是全心全意为人民服务和勤俭办院。应该以这个标准来衡量我们医院的一切工作；应该以这个标准来改革医疗制度，提高业务技术水平。我们为什么要坚持这个标准呢？那就是因为我们的医院是社会主义的、人民的。因此，为人民服务就是它的本来性质，就是一切工作的出发点和目的。具有这样一种性质的医院，必须坚持勤俭办院的方针。勤俭办医院可以说是我们医院社会主义性质的标志，是我们的医院与旧中国的医院的主要区别点。事实证明，哪一个医院对疾病的治愈率高，一切工作克勤克俭，一切制度、规定便利于病人，哪一个医院就受到人民的欢迎；否则，人民就不欢迎。
    我们强调勤俭办医院绝不是说医院中连一些必要的医疗设备和药材都不要了，也绝不是说为了勤俭就可以影响医疗质量的提高，也不能认为勤俭办医院就使得医学科学技术水平降低。勤就是勤勤恳恳，全心全意为人民服务；俭就是节约。我们说勤俭办医院不仅要在人力物力上反对铺张浪费、厉行节约，在医疗作风上反对粗枝大叶、不负责任；而且我们要尽量提高医疗质量，解决一切必需而且可能解决的医疗设备、器材，充分利用我们现有的一切设备，积极挖掘潜力，使病人得到技术优良而且经济的治疗。因此，我们勤俭办医院的方针是和提高医疗质量、技术水平相一致的，不是矛盾的。
    为了按照勤俭办医院、为人民服务这个标准来办好我们的医院，我们就要首先加强党的领导，加强政治思想教育，整顿医院工作队伍，发动群众来大鸣大放，揭露一切错误的思想和作风，展开争辩，树立勤俭办医院、为人民服务的思想作风。医院是知识分子成堆的地方，在医院中作好知识分子的思想改造工作是非常重要的，各级党委必须十分重视这一工作。
    为了坚决贯彻勤俭办医院的方针，今后在医院中必须克服浪费、降低基本建设和设备以及病人伙食的标准，改善医院的财务管理，整顿机构，根据情况精简行政勤杂人员，改变目前医院分科过细、人力浪费的情况。肯定地讲，当前我们医院中不论在人力、物力、财力上都是有潜力可以发挥的，只要解决了思想问题，把群众发动起来，一定能涌现出新的气象。为了便利病人就诊，有利于生产，各地医院要因地、因时制宜地推行三班门诊制，充分挖掘医院人员和设备的潜在力量。县、区医疗机构可以根据农村生产的特点采用随到随诊、上门出诊、巡回医疗等办法。总之，各个医疗机构，都要根据勤俭和一切便利于病人就诊的原则去安排自己的工作。今后在城乡医院中举办简易病床，这是我们从六亿人民出发，从我国经济情况和人民的生活水平出发提出的一项重大措施。简易病床是今后长期需要的一种形式，不但农村中需要，而且在城市中也需要，不但基层组织可以办，在大医院、教学医院也可以办。各地可以根据情况采取不同形式来设置。
    为了贯彻勤俭办医院、为人民服务的方针，要扩大预防，贯彻我国卫生工作预防为主思想。医务人员要深入到群众中去，向他们进行宣传工作，使他们掌握预防疾病的知识，指导他们开展爱国卫生运动，从而达到防治和消灭疾病的目的。
    为了贯彻勤俭办医院、为人民服务的方针，要进一步贯彻党的中医政策，充分地发挥中医在防治疾病中的作用，增进中西医团结，从思想上扭转不重视中医的现象。
    我们的口号是：树立全心全意为人民服务的医疗态度，勤俭办医院。全国医院工作人员必须在党的领导下，遵循党给医院所规定的方针，加强思想改造，提高政治觉悟，克勤克俭地办好人民的医院。
