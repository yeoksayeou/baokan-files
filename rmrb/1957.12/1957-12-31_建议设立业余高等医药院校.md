    Suggest Establishing Amateur Higher Medical Colleges
    After reading the "People's Daily" report on "Developing Amateur Higher Education," I was very excited. Developing amateur higher education is an important measure taken by the state to improve the scientific and technological level of cadres currently in service, especially worker and peasant cadres.
    Judging from the existing amateur higher education institutions, the vast majority are engineering-related, and there isn't even one amateur university for medicine and health. Is it that medical colleges are not suitable for running schools of an amateur nature? I don't think so, and I hope the Ministry of Higher Education will pay attention to this.
    Secondly, among the existing amateur higher education institutions, there are more night universities and fewer correspondence universities. I hope to vigorously develop correspondence universities so that not only cadres working in large cities can attend amateur higher education institutions, but also people in small cities can have the opportunity to receive amateur higher education through correspondence courses.

    建议设立业余高等医药院校
    看了“人民日报”关于“发展业余高等教育”的报道后，非常兴奋。发展业余高等教育是国家为了提高在职干部、特别是工农干部的科学技术水平的重要措施。
    从现有业余高等学校看来，绝大部分是工科，而医药卫生的业余大学一所也没有。是否医药院校不适合办业余性质的学校呢？我认为并不是这样，希望高等教育部重视起来。
    其次，现有的业余高等学校中，夜大学多而函授大学少。我希望大力发展函授大学，这样，不仅在大城市工作的干部可以上业余高等学校，在小城市的人也可以有机会通过函授来受到业余高等教育。
