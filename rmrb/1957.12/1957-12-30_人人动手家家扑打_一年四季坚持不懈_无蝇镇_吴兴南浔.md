Everyone Participates, Every Household Swats Flies; Perseverance Throughout the Year
Fly-Free Town—Nanxun, Wuxing
Jin Luo

    After two years of effort, Nanxun Town in Wuxing County has now become a "fly-free town."

    Nanxun Town began its "fly-free town" experiment in March 1956, according to a decision by the Wuxing County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Wuxing County People's Committee. By June of this year, a general survey showed that in the several residential election districts formally designated as experimental zones, over 99% of households were fly-free, and even in non-experimental zones, the fly-free rate reached 95%. In the town center, it is now possible to sleep without mosquito nets. Over the past two years, the patriotic health campaign and the elimination of the four pests have significantly improved the health of all town residents. According to statistics from the Nanxun Town Health Clinic, last year, outpatients with infectious diseases related to mosquitoes and flies accounted for a little over 17.4% of total outpatient visits; this year, from January to October, this figure has decreased to just under 4%. Due to the mass patriotic health campaign and public education, the hygiene habits of the masses have also significantly changed, fostering a good atmosphere where "everyone talks about cleanliness, and every household loves hygiene."

    Nanxun Town in Wuxing County has a population of over 13,000. The vast majority of the more than 3,400 households are engaged in industry, handicrafts, and commerce. The town has a large floating population, with farmers and vendors from all directions bustling about every day. Doing a good job of hygiene in this place and creating the miracle of a "fly-free town" is not an easy task. However, where there's a will, there's a way. The achievements and experiences of Nanxun Town over the past two years are worthy of our attention.

    Fully Mobilizing the Masses to Make Hygiene Work Regular

    Over the past two years, Nanxun Town has gained considerable and complete experience in hygiene work. They have basically adopted a method of combining the elimination of the four pests with the launch of a mass patriotic health campaign, embodying the mass and regular nature of the health movement, and implementing the spirit of "running all undertakings diligently and thriftily." Hygiene work cadres are also able to proactively use their scientific and technical knowledge to serve the health movement.

    The significant achievements of hygiene work in Nanxun Town are inseparable from the leadership of the Party and the government. After the Wuxing County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Wuxing County People's Committee decided to conduct the "fly-free town" experiment in Nanxun Town, they regularly concerned themselves with the town's progress. Important guidelines, principles, and requirements were all proposed after research and discussion by the County Committee. The Nanxun Town Committee and Town People's Committee also played an active leading role in specific work, implementing the mass line working method, proactively arranging work, and combining central work with hygiene work. In addition, responsible comrades from the Town Committee and Town People's Committee personally participated in hygiene inspections, cleaning, and fly-swatting activities. The Town Committee also organized residents to conduct hygiene inspections in factories, government offices, schools, and other units based on the demands of the masses, supervising these units to do a good job in hygiene work.

    A Relatively Complete Set of Systems

    At the beginning of the patriotic health campaign, and at the beginning of each stage of the shock campaign, it is necessary to carry out extensive publicity campaigns to raise the awareness of the masses and criticize the thinking of "fearing trouble and fearing difficulty." To this end, Nanxun Town mobilized a wide range of publicity forces, using more than ten kinds of publicity tools to create a huge publicity momentum. At the same time, discussions were carried out through various meetings all the way down to the residents' groups, so that the publicity for eliminating the four pests truly reached every household and penetrated the hearts of the people. In order to make hygiene work regular, a relatively complete set of systems has also been established throughout the town. For example, the entire town, with households as units, formulated fly-swatting targets level by level. Each election district and collective unit designated special personnel to collect and submit the four pests, issue receipts, and report statistics on a regular basis. Each residents' group also formulated sanitation covenants (combined with the public security department's "four preventions" covenant). All food and beverage businesses also listed fulfilling the sanitation covenant as one of the main items in the socialist labor competition. In addition, there are also regular cleaning systems (once every seven, ten, or fifteen days) and temporary and regular inspection systems, red flag circulation competition systems, and systems for various organizations and groups to accept resident inspections, etc. Because these systems can be resolutely implemented, the regularization of the patriotic health campaign is guaranteed.

    Deploying Central Work While Arranging Hygiene Work

    Closely related to the implementation of the regular patriotic hygiene system is the issue of unified arrangement of central work and hygiene work. In this regard, Nanxun Town has also created some experiences. The Town Committee adopted the method of "unified leadership, divided line operations," dividing all work into four fronts: industry, commerce, handicrafts, and resident work (including government office work and cultural, educational, and health work), with at least one member of the Town Committee responsible for specifically grasping each front. At the same time, when the Town Committee convened heads of various regions and units to study and deploy work, it always made sure to clearly put forward the central tasks, and also did not neglect the arrangement of hygiene work, thus enabling the continuous and smooth development of the regular patriotic hygiene movement.

    Timely Issuing New Requirements Based on Different Seasons

    Nanxun Town has also noticed that, based on seasonal conditions and combined with the original hygiene habits of the masses, new requirements are promptly put forward to carry out the patriotic hygiene campaign. Generally speaking, the work is carried out around five different festivals (New Year's Day, Spring Festival, Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, National Day). Taking this year as an example, the progress of the hygiene campaign in Nanxun Town in each quarter is as follows:

    Around New Year's Day and the Spring Festival, combined with the masses' original "dusting" customs, the masses were fully mobilized to carry out two comprehensive and thorough clean-up campaigns. At that time, the requirement of "moving everything, leaving no corner or hole untouched" was put forward to the masses, and places that were warm, humid, and suitable for mosquitoes and flies to hide were thoroughly cleaned to eliminate a large number of overwintering mosquitoes and flies. On the basis of the comprehensive clean-up, supplemented by drug pest control experiments, key areas were disinfected with drugs in places where manpower could not reach.

    In late February, the town launched another comprehensive pupae extermination campaign. All places where pupae and larvae were bred, such as manure tanks, garbage dumps, bone piles, and other places where organic decaying matter was piled, were repeatedly exterminated. The same treatment was given to fly pupae in the fourteen natural villages on the outskirts of the town. This time, a total of more than 3.6 million pupae were dug up, and the soil area covered more than 500 square meters, comprehensively eliminating the fly pupae in and around the town.

    In March, when mosquitoes and flies began to breed, a patriotic hygiene shock campaign was launched, focusing on eliminating and controlling the first generation of mosquito and fly larvae and their breeding grounds, comprehensively and thoroughly overturning jars and pouring out basins, and improving environmental sanitation. All water-filled containers and water-filled places were cleaned, and in conjunction with the production increase and frugality campaign, about 600 meters of sewers were dredged, and part of the fertilizer was excavated to support agricultural production. For some Taiping water tanks and production water tanks that could not be abolished, the methods of changing water frequently, raising fish, or placing "666" gypsum bricks were adopted. Key inspections and key treatments were carried out for some water-filled places that could not be filled, were not easy to handle, and were prone to breeding flies. In addition, the masses were required to immediately kill the first generation of mosquitoes and flies as soon as they were discovered, so as to "fight early, fight small, and fight thoroughly."

    May and June are the seasons when mosquitoes and flies breed in large numbers. The whole town seized the two links of strictly controlling the habitat and breeding grounds of mosquitoes and flies and vigorously exterminating adult mosquitoes and flies, and launched a shock campaign around the Dragon Boat Festival, carrying out a comprehensive clean-up, focusing on cleaning firewood rooms, kitchens, courtyards, livestock pens, and other places, removing roadside weeds, dredging ditches, and using artificial swatting methods to eliminate a large number of mosquitoes and flies, greatly reducing the density of mosquitoes and flies.

    After July, in addition to continuing to vigorously exterminate mosquitoes and flies, the breeding grounds of mosquitoes and flies were continuously controlled. The part of the manure tank in the town that had not yet been treated, the fourteen manure tanks and ponds, pools, and depressions in the suburbs of the town were disinfected with drugs once every ten days. In addition to maintaining "two cleanliness and three no's" (the inside of the upper and lower four walls and six sides are clean, the outside four weeks are clean; no flies, no maggots, no odor) in public toilets, disinfection work is also often carried out. Streets, bridges, and other public places are cleaned once or twice a day, and the cleaning sections for residents and sanitation workers are designated to maintain cleanliness and hygiene at all times.

    Because different measures are taken in different seasons, the regularity of hygiene work is guaranteed, and the hygiene work in each period has a certain focus, which has received significant results.

    Giving Play to the Role of Activists and Attaching Importance to the Creativity of the Masses

    In carrying out the patriotic hygiene campaign, how to give play to the role of activists and drive the masses to participate in the movement is a very important task. In order to carry out the experiment of "fly-free town" in Nanxun Town, although a number of hygiene work cadres were equipped, it would not have been possible to achieve such achievements in two years without the large number of activists and backbone forces among the masses. In the fourteen residential election districts in Nanxun Town, each election district has a hygiene movement shock team, with more than 100 people participating in the work of the shock team. The form and task of the shock team are very flexible. According to the needs of the work, it can become a shock team, a propaganda team, and an inspection team for eliminating the four pests at any time. Among the residents, it is also a force for carrying out organizational work. In the hygiene movement over the past two years, activists have been constantly emerging and trained. Last year, a total of more than 40 activists and advanced units for eliminating the four pests were selected in the town. This year, the number of activists has expanded to 116. For example, Wang Ajin, one of the four most famous activists in the town, is 60 years old this year; she often turned in the flies she swatted by the kilogram. Over the past two years, she has been successively rated as an activist for eliminating the four pests and a "five-good" activist for workers' families in the special zone, county, and town, and has also attended the provincial "five-good" activist meeting for workers' families. Among the more than 70 people's representatives in Nanxun Town, more than 10 were elected because of their active hygiene work. These facts have greatly improved the enthusiasm of the masses to do a good job in cleaning and hygiene.

    In the town, good experiences created by activists and the masses in the hygiene movement, such as the masses finding that overwintering fly pupae were mostly buried in the soil under the manure tank when they moved the manure tank, which found an important breeding ground for flies. When stacking wine jars, the workers of Zhang Hengchang Sauce Garden adopted the method of stacking wine jars with the mouth of the jar facing down and the bottom of the jar tilted at a 45-degree angle, so that water would not accumulate in the jar, and rain water would not accumulate at the bottom of the jar even if it faced up. These experiences have been valued and promoted.

    Another favorable condition for Nanxun Town to do a good job in hygiene work is that the town has a sanitation center with more than 70 employees. The workers of the sanitation center have undertaken very important tasks in the hygiene movement. All the cleaning and hygiene work of public places such as feces, public toilets, garbage bins, streets, and rivers is undertaken by them, ensuring the environmental hygiene of the whole town. Because they played a great role in the hygiene movement, they were rated as an advanced work unit in the province in 1956.

    Being Diligent and Frugal, Spending Less Money, Doing Good Things

    The sanitation work in Nanxun Town basically conforms to the spirit of "running all undertakings diligently and thriftily," achieving not spending money and spending less money. From last year to this year, the town only spent more than 100 yuan on purchasing some prizes when rewarding activists. Less medicine was used last year (part of what was distributed by the province has not been used up), and only 800 kilograms of "666" powder was used this year, at a price of about 350 yuan. The Party Committee and the health department had determined the principle of "artificial as the main, drugs as auxiliary" in advance, clearly pointing out that the main reliance was on mobilizing the masses to do a good job in hygiene work, that is, relying on artificial extermination of adult mosquitoes and flies; relying on artificial control of mosquito and fly breeding grounds. Only in cases where artificial control is impossible, a small amount of drugs are used. These regulations have generally been done by the masses. This year, when the county put forward higher requirements for hygiene work, some people proposed to use more drugs. At this time, the Town Committee expressed to everyone: It is necessary to combine technical guidance with mass movement; but at the same time, it also pointed out: In order to practice frugality, it is necessary to strive for the greatest effect with a small amount of drugs.

    Learning While Doing, Technical Work Keeping Up

    In Nanxun Town, in addition to the doctors in the town health clinic, none of the health work cadres sent by the county epidemic prevention station were technically trained personnel. However, over the past two years, they have "learned while doing, learned while doing" in the mass movement, used their brains, and also carried out some technical work. Although these technical tasks still need to be further improved, they are all relatively practical. They have gone to the Nanjing Epidemic Prevention Station to learn work experience, and they have also learned from books and periodicals, paying attention to using the scientific and technical forces in nearby areas. For example, they do not have meteorological equipment, so they contacted the teachers of Wuxing No. 1 Middle School and borrowed their meteorological data for application. In the hygiene movement, they investigated the density of mosquitoes and flies and larvae to guide the development of the movement; they also learned from foreign experience and manufactured "666" powder gypsum bricks to eliminate larvae in Taiping water tanks and other water-filled containers. They have also basically mastered and controlled the breeding grounds of golden flies and meat flies through investigation and research. For the extermination of house flies, the Nanjing Epidemic Prevention Station sent them samples of house fly pupae, so that they learned the ability to identify house fly pupae, and eliminated a large number of house fly pupae in livestock pens, slaughterhouses, and garbage dumps.

    In addition, during their study in Nanjing, the local health work cadres saw a small fish called the Chinese crucian carp (also known as the Chinese fighting fish, the local name in Wuxing is the rough-skinned fighting fish) at the Nanjing Epidemic Prevention Station, which can eat a lot of larvae. After returning to Nanxun, they found that there were many of these fish in the Nanxun area. This fish is only about one inch in size, and its skin and scales are very rough, and even cats do not want to eat it, but it eats larvae more fiercely than willow fish. They once conducted an experiment: a Chinese crucian carp can eat more than 200 larvae in more than 40 minutes. What needs to be further experimented with now is how much ability this fish has to swallow larvae in the wild.

    Several Issues to Pay Attention To

    Judging from the health work in Nanxun Town, there are still some shortcomings that need to be greatly corrected:

    First, the development of the movement is not balanced enough. Over the past two years, it has focused on the work of exterminating mosquitoes and flies, and the work of eliminating rats and sparrows has not been done well enough; the hygiene work of related food and beverage industries and hygiene industries has not been done thoroughly enough; the water source management work has also not been done seriously. The hygiene appearance of a small number of election districts still needs to be greatly improved.

    Second, the fundamental problem of exterminating mosquitoes and flies lies in controlling breeding grounds. At present, Nanxun District has basically controlled the breeding grounds of golden flies and meat flies, but the problem of how to control the breeding grounds of house flies has not been well solved. Controlling the breeding grounds of house flies is a very meticulous and complex task, which requires more effort in the future. The work of treating the root of the problem also needs to be further improved in terms of mosquito extermination.

    Third, in terms of the regularization of the movement, although Nanxun Town has achieved results, there are still times when there is a slack phenomenon. For example, since the autumn of this year, the hygiene work has not been as energetic as it was before the summer, so that the density of mosquitoes and flies has increased slightly again. This requires educating the masses at any time to overcome complacency and paralysis, especially in late autumn and early winter, it is necessary to overcome the slack mood of "almost done" and "it's cold, it doesn't matter if there are a few mosquitoes and flies."

    Fourth, scientific and technical work should catch up, otherwise the level of the hygiene movement cannot be improved, and the work achievements will be difficult to consolidate. In this regard, scientific and health work cadres still need to make further efforts.

    Nanxun Town, Wuxing County, which created the "fly-free town," has a new look in hygiene work. Every corner and public place in the town is often kept clean.

    人人动手家家扑打　一年四季坚持不懈
    无蝇镇——吴兴南浔
    金萝
    吴兴县南浔镇经过两年来的努力，现在已经成为“无蝇镇”。
      南浔镇从1956年3月根据中共吴兴县委和吴兴县人民委员会的决定开始“无蝇镇”的实验工作。到今年6月份普查结果，镇内正式划为实验区的几个居民选区，无蝇户已达到99％以上，非实验区的无蝇户也达到95％；镇中心已经可以不挂蚊帐睡觉。两年来，由于开展了爱国卫生运动和除四害工作，已显著改变了全镇居民的健康状况，据南浔镇卫生所统计，去年全镇患与蚊蝇有关的传染病例的门诊病人占门诊总次数的17.4％强；而今年1至10月份则已降低到4％弱。由于开展了群众性的爱国卫生运动和宣传教育，更显著地改变了群众的卫生习惯，形成了“人人讲清洁，家家爱卫生”的良好风气。
    吴兴县南浔镇有一万三千多人口。三千四百多户居民绝大部分是从事工业、手工业和商业的。镇上人口的流动性很大，每天可以看到熙熙攘攘地来自四面八方的农民和商贩。要想做好这地方的卫生工作，创造“无蝇镇”的奇迹，这不是一件容易的事。然而，事在人为，南浔镇两年来的成绩和经验，值得我们重视。
    充分发动群众使卫生工作经常化
    两年来，南浔镇已经获得了相当完整的卫生工作经验。他们基本上采取了除四害和开展群众性的爱国卫生运动相结合的方法，体现出卫生运动的群众性和经常性，贯彻了“勤俭办一切事业”的精神。卫生工作干部也能够主动地将自己的科学技术知识为卫生运动服务。
    南浔镇的卫生工作获得显著成绩，是与党和政府的领导分不开的。中共吴兴县委和吴兴县人民委员会确定在南浔镇进行“无蝇镇”的实验工作后，经常关心这个镇的工作的进展，重要的方针、原则和要求，都是在县委会研究讨论后提出的。南浔镇委和镇人民委员会在具体工作中，也起了积极的领导作用，贯彻了群众路线的工作方法，主动安排工作，使中心工作和卫生工作相结合；此外，镇委和镇人民委员会负责同志还亲自参加卫生检查、打扫清洁、扑灭苍蝇等活动，镇委还根据群众的要求，组织居民到工厂、机关、学校等单位进行卫生检查，监督这些单位做好卫生工作。
    有一套比较完整的制度
    在爱国卫生运动开始时，以及在每一阶段的突击运动开始时，必须开展广泛的宣传运动，以提高群众的认识，批判“怕烦、怕难”的思想。为此南浔镇曾经动员了广泛的宣传力量，使用十多种宣传工具，造成巨大的宣传声势。与此同时，还通过各种会议一直布置到居民小组中去开展讨论，使除四害的宣传真正达到家喻户晓，深入人心。为了使卫生工作经常化，全镇还建立了一套比较完备的制度。例如全镇以户为单位，逐级订出了灭蝇指标，各选区和各集体单位都推定专人收集和汇缴四害、开具收据、按期统计上报。各居民小组还订立了卫生公约（结合公安部门的“四防”公约）；各饮食行业也将履行卫生公约列为社会主义劳动竞赛的主要项目之一。此外，还有经常性的打扫制度（每隔七天、十天或十五天一次）和临时性、经常性的检查制度、红旗循环竞赛制度、各机关团体接受居民检查的制度等等。由于这些制度都能坚决贯彻，才保证了爱国卫生运动的经常化。
    部署中心工作同时安排卫生工作
    与执行经常性的爱国卫生制度有密切关系的，是统一安排中心工作和卫生工作的问题。这方面，南浔镇也创造了一些经验。镇委采取了“统一领导、分线作战”的方法，将全部工作分为工业、商业、手工业和居民工作（包括机关工作和文教卫生工作）四条战线，每条战线至少有一个镇委委员负责具体掌握。与此同时，镇委在召集各地区、单位负责人研究与部署工作时，总是做到既明确地提出中心任务，也不忽视对卫生工作的安排，因而使经常性的爱国卫生运动得以继续顺利开展。
    根据不同季节及时提出新的要求
    南浔镇还注意到根据季节情况，结合群众原有的卫生习惯，及时提出新的要求，开展爱国卫生运动。总的说来，是围绕着五个不同的节日（元旦、春节、端午、中秋、国庆）来开展工作的。以今年为例，南浔镇在各季度中开展卫生运动的进程是这样的：
    在元旦和春节前后，结合群众原有的“掸尘”习俗，充分发动群众，分别进行了两次全面、彻底的清洁大扫除；当时向群众提出了
  “百物一动，不漏一角一洞”的要求，对温暖、潮湿的地方以及适合蚊蝇躲藏的地方都彻底地加以打扫，以消灭大量的越冬蚊蝇。在全面大扫除的基础上，再辅以药物杀虫的实验工作，对人力所不及的地方则有重点地进行了药物消毒。
    2月下旬，镇上又开展了一次全面灭蛹运动，凡是有蛹蛆孳生的地方，如粪缸、垃圾堆、堆骨场和其他堆放有机腐败物质的地方，都反复进行了灭蛹工作。对镇郊十四个自然村的蝇蛹，也作了同样的处理。这一次先后共挖蛹三百六十多万只，紧土面积五百多平方公尺，比较全面地消灭了镇上和镇郊的蝇蛹。
    到了3月份蚊、蝇开始繁殖的时候，又开展一个以消灭和控制早春第一代蚊蝇幼虫及其孳生地为主要内容的爱国卫生突击运动，全面彻底地进行了翻缸倒钵、改善环境卫生的工作，清理了所有积水容器和积水场所，并且结合增产节约运动，有重点地疏通了下水道约六百公尺，挖出一部分肥料支援农业生产。对一些不能取缔的太平水缸和生产用水缸，则采用勤换水、养鱼或投放“六六六”石膏砖的办法。对一些不能填平、不易处理的积水场所和容易繁殖苍蝇的重点场所，则进行重点检查和重点处理。此外，还要求群众一发现第一代蚊蝇立即加以扑灭，做到“打早、打小、打了”。
    5、6月份是蚊蝇大量繁殖的季节，全镇就抓住严密控制蚊、蝇栖息和孳生场所，大力扑灭成蚊成蝇这两个环节，在端午节前后掀起一个突击运动，开展全面性的大扫除，重点打扫柴房、厨房、庭院、牲畜圈等场所，铲除路边杂草，疏通阴沟，并运用人工扑打法消灭大量蚊蝇，大大地降低了蚊蝇密度。
    7月份以后，除了继续大力扑灭蚊蝇以外，又继续控制蚊蝇的孳生场所，对镇上尚未处理的部分粪缸、镇郊的十四个粪缸和池塘、水潭、洼地等，每十天药物消毒一次，公共厕所除了保持“两净三无”（内部上下四壁六面干净，外部四周干净；无蝇、无蛆、无臭气）外，也经常进行消毒工作。街道、桥梁等公共场所，每天都打扫一、二次，并且划定了居民和清卫所工人的清扫地段，经常保持清洁卫生。
    由于在不同季节采取不同措施，从而保证了卫生工作的经常化，并使每一时期的卫生工作都有一定的重点，收到显著的效果。
    发挥积极分子的作用重视群众的创造
    在开展爱国卫生运动中，如何发挥积极分子的作用，带动群众投入运动，是一个非常重要的工作。南浔镇为了进行“无蝇镇”的实验工作，虽然配备了若干卫生工作干部，但是如果没有大量涌现出来的群众中的积极分子和骨干力量，要在两年内获得这样的成绩还是不可能的。在南浔镇的十四个居民选区里，每个选区都有一个卫生运动的突击队，全镇共有一百多人参加突击队的工作。突击队的形式和任务都非常灵活，它根据工作的需要，随时可以成为除四害的突击队、宣传队以及检查队。在居民中，它又是一支进行组织工作的力量。在两年来的卫生运动中，还不断地涌现和培养了积极分子。全镇去年共评选了四十多名除四害积极分子和先进单位，今年，积极分子人数又扩大到一百一十六人。例如全镇最有名的四个积极分子之一的王阿金老太太，今年已经六十岁了；她常常把扑打来的苍蝇论斤上缴，两年来，连续被评为专区、县、镇除四害积极分子和工人家属五好积极分子，还出席过省职工家属五好积极分子会议。在南浔镇的七十多名人民代表中，有十多名是由于卫生工作积极而当选的。这些事实，大大地提高了群众做好清洁卫生工作的积极性。
    在镇上，积极分子和群众在卫生运动中创造的良好经验，例如群众在迁移粪缸时，发现过冬的蝇蛹大都埋藏在粪缸底下的泥土里，这就找到了苍蝇的重要孳生场所。张恒昌酱园职工在堆叠酒坛时，采用了坛口朝下、坛底作四十五度倾斜的方法，使坛内既不会积水、坛底虽然朝上也不至于积下雨水。这些经验都得到重视和推广。
    南浔镇搞好卫生工作还有一个有利条件，是镇上设有一个有七十多职工的清卫所。清卫所的工人在卫生运动中担负了很重要的任务，所有粪便、公共厕所、垃圾箱、街道、河流等公共场所的清洁卫生工作都由他们担负起来，保证了全镇的环境卫生。由于在卫生运动中发挥了很大的作用，1956年他们被评为全省先进工作单位。既勤又俭
    少花钱  办好事
    南浔镇的卫生工作，基本上符合“勤俭办一切事业”的精神，做到不花钱和少花钱。从去年到今年，镇上只是在奖励积极分子时，花了一百多元购买一部分奖品。去年使用的药物比较少（省里发下去的一部分还未用完），今年也只用了八百斤“六六六”粉，价约三百五十元。党委和卫生部门事先就确定了“人工为主，药物为辅”的原则，明确指出主要依靠发动群众来做好卫生工作，即依靠人工扑灭成蚊、成蝇；依靠人工控制蚊蝇孳生场所。只有在人工无法控制的情况下，才采用少许药物。这些规定，群众一般都办到了。今年，当县里对卫生工作提出更高的要求后，曾有人提出要多使用药物，这时，镇委就向大家表示：要做到使技术指导和群众运动相结合；但同时也指出：为了厉行节约，要以少量的药物争取最大的效果。
    边学边做  技术工作紧跟上
    在南浔镇，除了镇卫生所的医师以外，由县防疫站派去的卫生工作干部，没有一个是受过专门训练的技术人员。但是这两年来，他们在群众运动中“边做边学，边学边做”，开动了脑筋，也进行了若干技术工作。这些技术工作，虽然还需要继续提高，但是都较实用。他们曾经到南京市防疫站去学习工作经验，也向书本、报刊学习，注意运用附近地区的科学技术力量。例如他们没有气象设备，就和当地吴兴一中的教师取得联系，借用他们的气象资料来应用。在卫生运动中，他们调查了蚊蝇和孑孓的密度，指导运动的开展；还学习了外地的经验，制造了“六六六”粉石膏砖，消灭太平水缸等积水器内的孑孓。他们还经过调查研究，基本上掌握与控制了金蝇、麻蝇的孳生场所。对于消灭家蝇，南京市防疫站为他们送来了家蝇蛹的样品，使他们学会了识别家蝇蛹的本领，在牲畜圈、屠宰场、垃圾堆里消灭了大量家蝇蛹。
    此外，当地的卫生工作干部在南京学习期间，曾在南京市防疫站看到一种叫中华鲋鱼（又名中华斗鱼，吴兴土名糙皮斗）的小鱼，能大量吃孑孓。他们回到南浔后，发现这种鱼在南浔一带很多。这种鱼只有一寸左右大小，皮、鳞很糙，连猫也不要吃，但它吃起孑孓来，比柳条鱼还厉害。他们曾进行了一次试验：一条中华鲋鱼，在四十多分钟内，能把二百多条孑孓吃光。现在，需要进一步实验的是这种鱼在野生情况下对吞食孑孓的能力究竟有多大。
    要注意的几个问题
    从南浔镇的卫生工作情况看来，目前还存在若干缺点，需要大力改正：
    第一，运动的发展还不够平衡，两年来偏重于扑灭蚊蝇的工作，对消灭鼠雀的工作还做得不够；有关饮食行业、卫生行业的卫生工作做得不够彻底；水源管理工作也未认真做好。有少数选区的卫生面貌还有待于大力改善。
    第二，扑灭蚊蝇的根本问题，在于控制孳生场所。目前，南浔区对金蝇、麻蝇的孳生场所基本上已经加以控制，但如何控制家蝇孳生场所的问题还未很好解决。控制家蝇孳生场所是一个非常细致复杂的工作，这就需要在今后加一把劲。灭蚊方面也需要进一步做好治本的工作。
    第三，在运动的经常化方面，南浔镇虽然获得了成绩，但有时候仍有松懈现象。如今年秋季以来，卫生工作就没有夏季以前那样有劲，以致蚊蝇密度又稍有增加。这就需要随时教育群众克服自满麻痹情绪，特别是晚秋和初冬季节，更要克服“差不多了”“天冷了，有几个蚊蝇也无所谓”的松懈情绪。
    第四，科学技术工作应该赶上去，否则卫生运动水平就无法提高，工作成绩也难以巩固。这方面，还需要科学、卫生工作干部作进一步的努力。
    创造了“无蝇镇”的吴兴县南浔镇，出现了卫生工作的新面貌。镇上各个角落和公共场所经常保持干净。
