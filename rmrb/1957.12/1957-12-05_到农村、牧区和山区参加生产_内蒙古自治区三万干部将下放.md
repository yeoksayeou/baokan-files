　　Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, December 4th. On top of transferring 12,000 cadres downward this spring, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will transfer another 30,000 cadres to rural areas, pastoral areas, and peripheral mountainous areas this year to participate in socialist construction. This was stated by Wang Duo, Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, on the 2nd at a meeting of members of the Rectification Leadership Group directly under the Autonomous Region.

　　Wang Duo said that through this spring's streamlining of institutions and the transfer of cadres downward, some institutions in the Autonomous Region have initially changed the phenomenon of bloated institutions and overstaffing, and improved the efficiency of institutional work. The cadres transferred downward have enriched and strengthened the grassroots level, further close the ties between the Party and the masses, and also opened up the road for cadres to return to production, thereby strengthening the labor production front. Wang Duo pointed out that the work of streamlining institutions and transferring cadres downward last time was not thorough enough. For example, the Autonomous Region Supply Bureau, the Handicraft Industry Administration, etc., only became bureaus under the department, and the number of personnel was not reduced or reduced very little. The work of transferring cadres downward was also not thorough enough. A considerable number of personnel who were originally planned to be transferred have not been transferred for various reasons; there are also quite a lot of people going to schools to study. In the current rectification, cadres of all ethnic groups have raised these shortcomings. In addition, in the previous stage of work, attention was only paid to streamlining administrative organs, and no attention was paid to streamlining non-production personnel in business and enterprise departments. This aspect should be the focus of streamlining institutions in this rectification. The work of streamlining institutions in the league, administrative region, banner, and county-level organs of the Autonomous Region is also not thorough enough, and there is even an increase in personnel in individual units.

　　Wang Duo pointed out that in the future, many institutions at the level of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region can consider being abolished or merged, and some league and administrative region institutions can also be greatly reduced according to changes in tasks. Some institutions at the banner, county, and city level can also be merged.

　　Wang Duo finally talked about the fact that this time, cadres must be transferred to the very bottom to participate in agricultural and pastoral production, so that they can be tempered in labor and change the shortcomings of past layer-by-layer transfers.

    到农村、牧区和山区参加生产
　　内蒙古自治区三万干部将下放
    新华社呼和浩特4日电　内蒙古自治区将在今年春天下放干部一万二千人的基础上再下放三万人，到农村、牧区和边沿山区去参加社会主义建设。这是中共内蒙古自治区委员会书记王铎2日在自治区直属机关召开的整风领导小组成员会议上说的。
    王铎说，经过今年春天的紧缩机构下放干部，自治区一些机关初步改变了机构庞大、人浮于事的现象，提高了机关工作的效率。下放的干部充实和加强了基层，使党同群众的联系进一步密切了，同时也开辟了干部回到生产去的道路，因而加强了劳动生产战线。王铎指出，上次紧缩机构、下放干部的工作做得还不够彻底，如自治区供应局，手工业管理局等只是变为厅属局，人员没有减或减得很少。下放干部的工作也进行得不够彻底，原来已经打算下放的工作人员中，有相当数量的人因为种种原因还未下放；进学校学习的人员也相当多。在目前整改中，各民族干部已经提到这些缺点。另外，在上一阶段工作中只注意紧缩行政机关，而没有注意紧缩事业企业部门的非生产人员，这次整风中应该把这方面作为紧缩机构的重点。自治区各盟、行政区和旗、县一级机关紧缩机构的工作进行得也不彻底，个别单位甚至还有增人的现象。
    王铎指出，今后内蒙古自治区一级机关有很多机构可以考虑撤销或合并，有些盟、行政区机构根据任务的变化也可以大大缩小。旗、县、市级机关有些机构也可以合并。
    王铎最后谈到这次下放干部必须一下子放到底，参加农牧业生产，使他们在劳动中受到锻炼，改变过去层层下放的缺点。
