Xinhua News Agency report: The peace proposals recently put forward by Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, in letters to the heads of Western governments have received great attention from public opinion in Western countries. Many influential newspapers have pointed out the great significance of the Soviet proposals for easing international tensions and have called on the governments of the countries concerned to give them serious consideration.

Some political figures and newspapers in Washington are calling for serious consideration of the Soviet proposals.

Senate Democratic Assistant Leader Mansfield on the 13th called for "appropriate consideration" of Bulganin's letters.

The "Washington Post" published an editorial on the 13th, advocating that the United States should accept the Soviet proposal to stop nuclear tests from January 1 next year and agree to hold a summit meeting of Eastern and Western governments.

The "New York Herald Tribune" also admitted that Bulganin's letter was "well-reasoned, logical, very persuasive and clearly and pertinently explained the current international tension," and that the letter "put forward constructive suggestions."

The "New York Times" said in an editorial that Bulganin's letter "should be carefully studied." While expressing opposition to holding another high-level meeting between East and West at this time, the newspaper also said, "This does not rule out the possibility of taking a positive attitude towards new negotiations."

The "Washington Post and Times-Herald" published an editorial entitled "America's Answer to Bulganin," saying, "The Soviet Premier emphasizes the possibility of disaster facing the world and puts forward a series of specific suggestions that he believes can improve the international situation. We believe that the United States should accept this call."

An article in London's "Daily Herald" criticized the West's attitude when commenting on the letter. The author questioned: "Why don't Western countries put forward their own proposals for a peaceful settlement of the European issue? When Mr. Khrushchev suggested negotiations and discussions on joint troop withdrawals in Europe a few months ago, why didn't they immediately agree?"

"News Chronicle" foreign correspondent Forrest, in a report from Paris, criticized the North Atlantic Group's top-level meeting for only discussing military issues.

Paris' "Le Monde," reporting on Bulganin's letters to the heads of Western governments, wrote that the letter to Prime Minister Gaillard "is worded in a gentle and friendly way, which is enough to impress French public opinion."

"Le Monde" said that Bulganin's proposal to establish a nuclear-free zone in Central Europe "deserves serious study." "Le Monde" concluded that the possibility of talks between East and West does indeed exist.

West German Social Democratic Party Chairman Ollenhauer, at a press conference held in Bonn on the 13th, emphasized that the Soviet government's note to the governments of all United Nations member states and Bulganin's letter to Adenauer undeniably contain a series of specific proposals. It would be a serious mistake to regard them as mere propaganda. He called on the governments of the North Atlantic Group to seriously study these Soviet proposals.

Rome's "Unità" emphasized that if Bulganin's proposal is adopted, it would first stop the arms race, thereby leading people to abandon the plan to build rocket launch sites in Europe.

"Il Paese" said that Bulganin's letter was a warning to the member states of the Atlantic Group, urging them not to take new serious measures that would further strain international relations.

　　苏联和平建议受到西方舆论重视
    许多报刊要求有关国家政府认真考虑
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁最近分别给西方国家政府首脑的信件中所提出的和平建议，受到西方各国舆论的极大重视，许多有影响的报刊纷纷指出苏联的建议对于缓和国际紧张局势的重大意义，要求有关国家的政府认真考虑。
    华盛顿一些政界人士和报刊要求对苏联的建议给以认真的考虑。
    美国参议院民主党助理领袖曼斯菲尔德13日要求对布尔加宁的信件给予“适当的考虑”。
    “华盛顿邮报”13日发表社论，主张美国应该接受苏联关于从明年1月1日起停止核试验的建议，并同意召开东西方政府首脑会议。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”也承认布尔加宁的信是“理由充分、合乎逻辑、极有说服力并且明白和中肯地说明了当前的国际紧张局势”，信中“提出的是建设性的建议”。
    “纽约时报”在社论中说，布尔加宁的信“应当仔细研究”。这家报纸在表示反对在目前再次召开东西方高级会议的同时又说，“这并不排除对新的谈判采取积极态度的可能性”。
    “华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”刊载题为“美国给布尔加宁的回答”的社论说，“苏联总理强调指出世界面临灾难的可能性并且提出一系列他认为能改善国际局势的具体建议。我们认为，美国应当接受这个呼吁。”
    伦敦“每日先驱报”的一篇文章在评论这封信时指责西方的态度。作者质问：“为什么西方国家不提出它们自己的和平解决欧洲问题的建议？当赫鲁晓夫先生在几个月以前建议举行谈判和讨论在欧洲共同进行撤军的时候，它们为什么不马上就表示同意？”
    “新闻纪事报”外交记者福莱斯特在一篇从巴黎发来的报道里指责北大西洋集团最高级会议只讨论军事问题。
    巴黎“世界报”报道布尔加宁致西方国家政府首脑的信件时写道，给政府首脑盖伊阿的信“措词委婉友好，足以使法国舆论感动”。
    “世界报”说，布尔加宁提出在中欧建立没有原子武装地区的建议“值得认真研究”。“世界报”作出结论说，东西方举行会谈的可能性的确是存在的。
    西德社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔13日在波恩举行的记者招待会上，强调指出苏联政府致各联合国会员国政府的照会和布尔加宁给阿登纳的信件无可否认是包含着一系列的具体建议。如果把它们看作仅仅是宣传，那便要犯严重的错误。他要求北大西洋集团各国政府认真研究苏联的这些建议。
    罗马“团结报”强调指出，如果布尔加宁的建议被采纳，这首先就会使军备竞赛停止，从而也就会使人们放弃在欧洲建立火箭发射场的计划。
    “国家报”说，布尔加宁的信是要预先警告大西洋集团成员国，要他们不要采取会使国际关系更加紧张的新的严重措施。
