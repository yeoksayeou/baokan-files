Strengthen Inspection to Ensure Rectification Quality
Commentator of this newspaper

Many organizations are vigorously carrying out rectification. Units with correct rectification methods are resolving problems extremely quickly, with many units largely resolving hundreds or thousands of general and relatively easy-to-solve problems within ten days to half a month. To ensure the quality of rectification, it is now essential to conduct a serious and strict inspection of the rectification situation.

From the experience of some units that have conducted serious inspections, inspection is indeed an important measure to ensure the quality of rectification. After inspection, the Ministry of Railways discovered that some of its subordinate units were handling the opinions raised by the masses with a simple and perfunctory attitude: Some people had not even understood the opinions of the masses before rushing to express their attitude, resulting in irrelevant answers; some people only made abstract and general statements on the specific suggestions and criticisms raised by the masses. Some people tried their best to push the masses' opinions away, trying to shirk their responsibility. Still others verbally expressed acceptance of the masses' opinions but did not genuinely improve their work and style. The Ministry of Railways promptly discovered and corrected these shortcomings during the inspection, which reduced many defects and errors in the rectification.

Extensive airing of views, big-character posters, major rectification, and major improvement are, in themselves, the most in-depth and widespread mass inspection of our work and style. It is impossible to do a good job in rectification by sitting in the office and looking at the reports sent from below. It is relatively easy to find shortcomings in work; it is not so easy to overcome these shortcomings. On the other hand, the bureaucracy, subjectivism, sectarianism… and other erroneous understandings of many people do not disappear as soon as they enter the rectification stage, and solving problems will not be completely unaffected by these bad "-isms." The facts are not like this. Recently, in individual units of the central government organs, it has been discovered that a bureaucratic and formalistic attitude is being adopted towards rectification work, with a large number of the masses' opinions being transferred outwards and upwards; problems that should be solved are kept for reference or explained to the people who raised the opinions, and hardly any are actually rectified. However, when they report to the higher authorities, they claim that all these opinions have been dealt with. The Pharmaceutical Administration Department of the Ministry of Health is like this. The masses of the Pharmaceutical Administration Department raised a total of four hundred opinions. This department reported to the ministry that the opinions raised by the masses had been completely rectified. However, when the ministry went to inspect, it found that this was not the case at all. This department pushed some of the problems to the ministry for solution, some to the neighboring departments, and left two hundred and forty for itself, waiting to be solved in 1958 and during the second five-year plan. From this, it can be seen that the rectification situation cannot be completely judged based on the rectification figures reported from below. In some units, the figures are one thing, and whether they are really rectified is another; rectification is one thing, and whether the rectification is correct and good is another. If the leaders only look at the rectification figures, and think that it is almost done when they see that 80% or 90% have been rectified, then they will give great convenience to bureaucracy and other bad "-isms"; moreover, this practice of only looking at figures and not paying attention to quality, only listening to reports and not personally inspecting, is itself a manifestation of bureaucratic style.

Inspection not only requires leaders to do it themselves, but also requires the widespread mobilization of the masses to participate. Leaders are only a minority, and there are thousands of problems to be solved, so it is impossible to personally examine every item. Moreover, the problems that the masses can come into contact with may not be accessible to leaders. Therefore, organizing the masses to inspect the rectification under leadership will discover more problems and solve the problems more correctly. In this regard, many units have already taken some measures. When the Leading Group for Rectification in the Labor and Wages Department of the Ministry of Coal Industry inspected the rectification situation, they did not find anything improper. However, when the problems were handed over to the masses for inspection, problems were discovered. Among the twenty-odd problems that had been solved, for some problems, the leaders of the department should have put forward preliminary handling opinions and then forwarded them, but the department did not express any opinions before forwarding them. When the Construction Bank recently inspected the rectification, it also adopted the method of combining leaders and the masses. The leading group, on the one hand, organized various specialized groups to conduct inspections; on the other hand, it allowed the masses to raise opinions to see which problems had not been solved or were not satisfactorily solved, and which problems had not been aired. After inspection, the achievements of rectification were affirmed, and some shortcomings in the rectification work were also discovered, such as the improvement methods or explanations for individual problems were not appropriate enough, and after the improvement plan for individual problems was put forward, it was not promptly organized for implementation, and so on. This practice of mobilizing the masses to review the rectification is very worthy of promotion.

    加强检查保证整改质量
    本报评论员
    许多机关都在大力进行整改。整改方法正确的单位，解决问题的速度极快，不少单位在十天半月之内就把几百条几千条一般性的比较容易解决的问题大体解决完毕。为了保证整改的质量，这时候十分需要对整改情况进行一次认真的严格的检查。
    从已经认真进行检查的一些单位来看，检查的确是保证整改质量的一项重要措施。铁道部经过检查后，就发现了所属有些单位用简单草率的态度处理群众提出的意见：有些人还没有弄清楚群众的意见，就急于表示态度，以至文不对题，答非所问；有些人对群众提出的具体的建议和批评，只是抽象地笼统地表示一下态度就算了事。有些人把群众的意见尽量往外推，尽量想法脱掉自己的责任。还有些人是口头上表示接受群众的意见，而实际上并不真正在改进工作改进作风。铁道部在检查中及时发现和纠正了这些缺点，就使整改减少了许多缺点和错误。
    大鸣大放大整大改本来就是对我们的工作和作风的一次最深入最广泛的群众性的检查。以为坐在办公室里看看下面送来的汇报，就可以搞好整改，这是不可能的。发现工作中的缺点是比较容易的；要克服这些缺点，就不是那么容易了。另一方面，许多人的官僚主义、主观主义、宗派主义……以及其他错误的认识，并不是一进入整改阶段就都不再存在了，解决问题的时候，也不会就一点也不受这些坏主义的影响了。事实并不如此。最近在中央国家机关的个别单位，就发现用官僚主义和形式主义的态度对待整改工作，把群众的意见大量地往外转、往上送；把应该解决的问题留存参考，或者向提意见的人作解释，真正改了的简直没有几条。而当他们向上级汇报的时候却可以说是对这些意见都已作了处理。卫生部的药政司就是这样。药政司的群众一共提出了四百条意见。这个司向部里报告说，群众提出的意见已全部整改了。可是，部里一去检查，发现根本不是那么一回事，这个司把一部分问题推给部里去解决，一部分推给左邻右舍的司局去解决，自己留下了二百四十条，还要等待1958年和第二个五年计划期间解决。由此可见，并不能完全根据下边报上来的整改数字来判断整改的情况。在一些单位，数字是一回事，真的整改了没有是一回事；改了是一回事，改的对不对好不好又是一回事。如果领导者只看整改的数字，看到已改了80％、90％，就认为是差不多了，那就会给官僚主义以及其他坏主义大开方便之门；而且，这种只看数字不注意质量，只听汇报不亲自检查的作法，本身就是官僚主义作风的表现。
    检查不只是需要领导者亲自动手，而且还要广泛地发动群众参加。领导者只是少数，要解决的问题成千上万，不可能条条亲自过目。而且，群众能接触到的问题，领导者就不一定能接触到。因此，有领导地组织群众对整改进行检查，就会发现更多问题，把问题解决得更正确。在这方面许多单位都已经采取了一些措施。煤炭部劳动工资司整风领导小组检查整改情况的时候，没有发现什么不妥当的地方。可是把问题交给群众一检查，就发现了问题，在已经解决的二十来个问题中，对有一些问题，司的领导上应该提出初步处理意见，而后上转，但是司里没有表示意见就上转了。建设银行最近对整改进行检查的时候，也采取领导和群众相结合的办法，领导小组一方面组织各专门小组进行检查；一方面让群众提意见，看有那些问题还没有得到解决或解决的不满意，还有那些问题没有鸣放等。经过检查，既肯定了整改的成绩，也发现了整改工作中的一些缺点，比如个别问题的改进办法或解释意见不够妥善，个别问题提出改进方案以后，没有及时组织实现等等。这种发动群众对整改进行复查的作法是很值得提倡的。
