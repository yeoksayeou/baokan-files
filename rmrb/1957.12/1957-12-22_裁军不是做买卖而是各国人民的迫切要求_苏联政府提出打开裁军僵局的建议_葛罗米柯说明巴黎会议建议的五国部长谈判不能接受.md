Xinhua News Agency, December 21st: TASS Moscow reports: Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko, in response to inquiries at the joint session of the two houses of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on December 21st, said that although the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries have made efforts, the international tension has not eased, and the disarmament issue has not been resolved to this day. The Soviet government is very concerned about this. Gromyko emphasized that the disarmament issue should not fall into a deadlock. The Soviet government proposes convening a special session of the United Nations or a disarmament conference.

Gromyko recounted that disarmament negotiations have been going on in the United Nations for ten years, and no results have been achieved to this day, and now they have been interrupted again. Gromyko pointed out that the reason for this is that the main opponents in the negotiations, the United States, Britain, and France, do not want to undertake any obligations to stop the nuclear arms race. When the disarmament is being discussed fruitlessly within the United Nations, the governments of the United States, Britain, and France pretend to be in favor of disarmament at the negotiating table, while actually engaging in an arms race within the scope of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Gromyko emphasized that the United States very much wants to make the material and human resources of West Germany serve this aggressive organization.

Gromyko continued that the United States, Britain, France, and Canada have resisted all proposals on disarmament. The United States and Britain evaded resolving the disarmament issue, linking the signing of an agreement on this issue to some far-fetched conditions. They even complicated such a simple issue as stopping nuclear weapons testing. Gromyko said that the British and American governments are trying to gain a military advantage over the Soviet Union. The US government has tried every possible way to prevent the great China from participating in the resolution of the disarmament issue, which has put itself in a ridiculous situation.

Gromyko said that the reason why the US and British governments did not want disarmament in the past was because they thought, since they were strong, why should they disarm? However, the Soviet Union's recent scientific and technological achievements have completely shattered their illusion of superiority. Currently, the tone of the United States and Britain is: disarmament should not be carried out, but they should catch up with the Soviet Union in scientific and technological achievements, especially in the production of rockets.

Evaluating the Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Gromyko said that the meeting did not achieve the results expected by its organizers. The participating countries had to discuss the issues raised in Bulganin's letter to the heads of state of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states. In this way, it was as if the Soviet Union was invisibly attending the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting.

Gromyko emphasized that the Soviet government takes a positive attitude towards the sober assessment of the situation made by the heads of government of countries such as Norway and Denmark at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting; at the same time, it expresses doubts about whether Adenauer's refusal to provide the United States with rocket weapons bases is sincere. He said that Adenauer's statement is incompatible with his agreement to arm the West German army with atomic weapons and rocket weapons and to conduct joint scientific research in this regard.

Gromyko emphasized that, under these circumstances, the statements by the heads of certain countries regarding disagreement with their countries' existing borders are very worrying.

Gromyko said that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Paris meeting's suggestion of holding negotiations between ministers of five countries is not satisfactory to the Soviet Union and cannot be accepted by it. Some people are trying to have Soviet representatives sit at the same table with those with whom the Soviet Union has patiently, but fruitlessly, conducted disarmament negotiations for many years. The heads of Western countries should now understand that disarmament is not a business deal but the urgent demand of people of all countries. They must also take into account that today's world situation is not the world situation of a few months ago. The Soviet Union's two satellites have made due contributions.

    裁军不是做买卖而是各国人民的迫切要求
    苏联政府提出打开裁军僵局的建议
    葛罗米柯说明巴黎会议建议的五国部长谈判不能接受
    新华社21日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部长葛罗米柯21日在苏联最高苏维埃两院联席会议上回答询问时说：苏联和其他爱好和平国家虽然曾经作出努力，但是国际紧张局势尚未缓和，裁军问题直到现在还没有解决，苏联政府对此非常关切。葛罗米柯强调说，裁军问题不应当陷于僵局。苏联政府建议召开联合国特别会议或者裁军代表会议。
    葛罗米柯追述说，裁军谈判在联合国内已经进行了十年，到今天为止还没有获得任何结果，现在又中断了。葛罗米柯指出，其所以这样，是因为谈判的主要对手美、英、法不想承担任何停止核军备竞赛的义务。当在联合国内对裁军进行毫无结果的讨论的时候，美、英、法三国政府在谈判桌前装出赞成裁军的样子，而实际上却在北大西洋公约组织的范围中进行军备竞赛。葛罗米柯强调指出，美国很想使西德的物力和人力后备为这一侵略组织服务。
    葛罗米柯继续说，美国、英国、法国和加拿大抵制了一切关于裁军的建议。美国和英国逃避解决裁军问题，把签订关于这个问题的协定同一些牵强附会的条件联系起来。他们甚至把停止试验原子武器这样简单的问题也弄得很复杂。葛罗米柯说，英、美两国政府力图在军事方面取得对苏联的优势。美国政府千方百计地阻挠伟大的中国参加裁军问题的解决，这反而使自己处于可笑的境地。
    葛罗米柯说，美、英两国政府过去之所以不想裁军，是因为他们认为，既然他们强大，何必裁军呢。但是，苏联最近的科学和技术成就使他们的那种占居优势的幻想完全破灭了。目前美国和英国的腔调都是：不应当裁军，而应当在科学技术成就方面，特别是在生产火箭方面赶上苏联。
    葛罗米柯在评价北大西洋公约组织巴黎会议时说，这次会议没有达到它的组织者所预期的效果。会议的参加国不得不讨论布尔加宁给北大西洋公约组织成员国首脑的信中所提出的问题。这样一来，就好像苏联无形之中出席了北大西洋公约组织会议一样。
    葛罗米柯强调指出，苏联政府对于像挪威、丹麦这样一些国家的政府首脑在北大西洋公约组织会议上对局势所作的清醒估计，持肯定的态度；同时，对阿登纳拒绝为美国提供火箭武器基地是否真诚，表示怀疑。他说，阿登纳的这一声明跟他同意用原子武器和火箭武器武装西德军队以及同意在这方面进行共同的科学研究工作这两者是互不相容的。
    葛罗米柯强调说，在这种情况下，某些国家首脑关于不同意他们国家现有国界的声明使人感到非常忧虑。
    葛罗米柯说，北大西洋公约组织巴黎会议关于五国部长之间举行谈判的建议不能使苏联满意，也不能为它所接受。有人企图要苏联代表同那些苏联曾经与之耐心地、但毫无结果地进行了多年裁军谈判的人坐在一张桌子上。西方国家首脑现在应该明白，裁军不是做买卖，而是各国人民的迫切要求。他们还必须考虑到，今天的世界局势已经不是几个月以前的世界局势了。苏联的两个卫星已经作出了应有的贡献。
