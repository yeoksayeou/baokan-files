Xinhua News Agency, December 9th: The Qinghe Woolen Mill, one of China's largest woolen factories, owned by the Beijing local government, completed its first Five-Year Plan total output target more than a month ahead of schedule. In four years and eleven months, the cumulative production of woolen fabric reached 2 million meters, exceeding the Five-Year Plan by 140,000 meters; the cumulative production of Serge reached 3.07 million meters, exceeding the plan by 330,000 meters; and the wool yarn production reached 2.12 million kilograms, exceeding the Five-Year Plan by 140,000 kilograms. Compared with 1952, the year before the start of the first Five-Year Plan, the total output of various products this year increased by 3.8 times.

　　The quality of various products has been continuously improved. This year, the proportion of first-class woolen fabric reached 97.8% of the total woolen fabric products, the proportion of first-class serge reached 97.4%, and the first-class wool yarn reached 99.5%. Within five years, the factory added twenty-one new products, some of which have gained a good reputation in the market, and some have been selling well abroad. Labor productivity has also greatly improved. Calculated by value, the total value of products produced by each worker this year is equal to 3.5 times that of 1952.

　　In five years, this factory has accumulated more than 71 million yuan in funds for the country; this money can be used to build nine new woolen mills with 10,000 spindles each. With the continuous development of production, the material and cultural life of all employees has also been greatly improved.

　　The Beijing Qinghe Woolen Mill was built in 1907, but in 1949 it only produced more than 6,000 meters of woolen fabric and 4,000 kilograms of wool yarn. This year, many of the factory's machinery and equipment are still old equipment from fifty years ago, but these old machines have greatly exerted their power in the hands of workers who have become their masters. This year, the output of woolen fabric increased 87 times compared with 1949, and the output of wool yarn increased 156 times compared with 1949.

　　清河制呢厂提前完成五年计划
    据新华社9日讯　我国最大的毛织工厂之一——北京市地方国营清河制呢厂，提前一个多月完成了第一个五年总产量计划。在四年零十一个月中生产的毛呢累计共达二百万公尺，超过五年计划十四万公尺；哔叽产量累计达到三百零七万公尺，超过计划三十三万公尺；毛线产量达到二百一十二万公斤，超过五年计划十四万公斤。同第一个五年计划的前一年——1952年比较，这个厂今年各种产品总产量增加了三点八倍。
    各种产品的质量不断提高。今年，毛呢一等品占毛呢产品的比例达到97.8％，哔叽一等品的比例达到97.4％，毛线一等品达到99.5％。五年内全厂增加了二十一种新产品，有些产品在市场上已获得良好信誉，有的已畅销国外。工人劳动生产率也有了很大提高。按价值计算，今年每个工人生产的产品总值等于1952年的三点五倍。
    五年里，这个厂为国家积累资金达七千一百多万元；用这些钱可以新建九个一万锭子的毛织厂。随着生产不断发展，全厂职工物质文化生活也有了很大改善。
    北京市清河制呢厂建于1907年，但是在1949年它只生产毛呢六千多公尺，毛线四千公斤。今年，这个厂的许多机器设备仍然是五十年前的老设备，但是这些老机器在作了主人的工人手里，大大发挥了威力。今年，毛呢产量比1949年增加了八十七倍，毛线产量比1949年增加了一百五十六倍。
