    Victory Surely Belongs to Socialism
    Si Mu

    I. Facts Are the Most Eloquent

    Capitalism will eventually be replaced by socialism, and all countries will eventually take the socialist road. This is the inevitable trend of history and the unavoidable result of social progress. Socialism is a just cause, representing the requirements of the development of social productive forces and the direction of historical progress. Its superiority cannot be matched by the evil, declining, and decadent capitalism.

    However, the bourgeoisie, relying on this dying system to make fortunes, is unwilling to withdraw from the historical stage. It tenaciously defends it in every possible way, still dreaming of the eternal existence of capitalism. After the great victory of the October Socialist Revolution and the birth of the first socialist country, the Soviet Union, even though Churchill's attempt to strangle the communist infant "in the cradle" failed, and Truman's gleeful expectation of seeing the Soviet Union and Hitler's Germany "mutually wounded" in the anti-fascist war also became a bubble, until recently, Dulles and his ilk still comforted themselves by saying that the communist rule in the Soviet Union, China, and other countries was "a phenomenon that will disappear,"妄想 “改变共产党世界的性质”. As for some Western commentators who appear as apologists for capitalism, although they dare not rant and rave as they did in the past, describing socialism as an "absurd system that should be abolished" or a "historical mistake," they still stubbornly insist that socialism cannot surpass capitalism and that the Soviet Union cannot catch up with the United States.

    Facts are the most eloquent. For forty years, although world peace has been constantly undermined by the imperialists through comprehensive or local means, the two systems of socialism and capitalism have coexisted peacefully for most of the time. Of course, there are contradictions and struggles in peaceful coexistence, and the result of the confrontation and struggle is already clear: as Comrade Mao Zedong said, "It is not the West wind prevailing over the East wind, but the East wind prevailing over the West wind," and "the forces of the new world have surpassed those of the old world." Looking at the future, as long as "war can be prevented and peace can be maintained," in the process of peaceful competition, the decisive victory will surely belong to socialism, and the existing facts are the arguments.

    II. The Leap Forward of Socialism

    Historically, in the struggle against feudalism, capitalism took two or three hundred years to prove its superiority and become a world system. However, long before the October Revolution, it had begun to decline, and in terms of economic development, it was generally in a state of stagnation, and sometimes (such as the Great Depression of 1929-1933) even regressed. What about socialism? When the Communist Manifesto drafted by Marx and Engels was published in 1848, it was still an ideal. However, after seventy years, the October Revolution triumphed, and socialism took root on one-sixth of the world's land, becoming a living reality. This emerging system not only moved forward like the rising sun, but also accelerated its leap forward. Russia, a country that was economically backward before the revolution, after only twenty-two years, the Soviet Union's industrial development had left behind the most developed capitalist countries in Western Europe, such as Britain, France, and Germany, and jumped to the first place in Europe. Ten years later, due to the victory of the anti-fascist war and the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, socialist countries were no longer isolated islands in the vast ocean of capitalism, but developed into a powerful world system. In just three or forty years, socialism has grown so strong, and the pace of historical progress is obviously getting faster and faster.

    Now, as is well known, this socialist world system spans Europe and Asia, from the Pacific Ocean in the east to the Elbe River in the west, including thirteen countries. Its territory accounts for 26% of the world, its population accounts for about 35% of the world, its industrial output accounts for about one-third of the world, and its grain output accounts for about 40% of the world. While the socialist system is rapidly developing and growing, the imperialist colonial system is rapidly disintegrating. In the twelve years since the war, more than a dozen countries have broken free from the shackles of imperialism and achieved independent status, and the liberation movement in colonies and semi-colonies continues to strengthen. This has made the old capitalist world even smaller and its power even more isolated. Even within the imperialist countries, there are many contradictions and divisions. As the declaration of the meeting of representatives of the communist and workers' parties of the twelve socialist countries pointed out: within the imperialist camp, "the increasingly sharp contradictions exist not only between the bourgeoisie and the working class, but also among the monopoly bourgeoisie and various strata of the people, and between the monopoly bourgeoisie of the United States and the people and even the bourgeoisie of other capitalist countries." Comrade Mao Zedong said, "Now there are 2.7 billion people in the world, the population of socialist countries is nearly one billion, the population of independent former colonial countries is more than 700 million, the population of countries striving for independence or complete independence is 600 million, and the population of the imperialist camp is only about 400 million." The comparison of these numbers, one billion, thirteen billion to four hundred million, also shows in terms of population that "socialism is developing upward, while imperialism is declining."

    III. Made a "Summary" of the Competition

    The most vivid and convincing argument that proves that the East wind prevails over the West wind and that the forces of the new world surpass those of the old world is the successful launch of the two Soviet artificial satellites. We know that in addition to boasting about the military "superiority" and industrial development of the imperialist camp, capitalist apologists most like to boast about the "advanced" science and technology of Western countries, especially the United States, and ridicule the "backwardness" of socialist countries. Even when the Soviet Union announced its preparation to launch the first artificial satellite, Washington officials could not help but "laugh" and named their planned 1.5-kilogram artificial satellite carrier rocket "Vanguard" first, confident that it would also take the lead. But now the whole world has seen that two Soviet artificial satellites have been launched into the sky one after another, while the much-hyped and "long-awaited" launch of the American "Vanguard" artificial satellite failed shamefully and miserably amidst the wailing in Washington and the ridicule around the world. In contrast, who is advanced and who is backward is even more clearly exposed. Experts and scientists tell us that the Soviet artificial satellites went into the sky, indicating that the Soviet science and technology in many important fields (such as physics, mathematics, mechanics, chemistry, metallurgy, electronics, automatic control, jet technology, and radio technology) has reached its peak and can solve many complex problems that predecessors have not solved. Coupled with the Soviet Union's "world first" positions in atomic power plants, jet airliners, synchrophasotrons, intercontinental missiles, and atomic icebreakers, the development of Soviet science and technology has far surpassed the United States and other Western countries. In the face of such ironclad facts, American and British scientists and political commentators could not help but exclaim that since the day the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite on October 4, the United States had been reduced to a "second-rate country" in science and technology, and the United States was ten years behind the Soviet Union. Even Washington officials, who had always been arrogant, had to publicly declare for the first time that they would strive to "catch up with the Soviet Union." The launch of two Soviet artificial satellites not only marked the great victory of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union in the science and technology competition, but also most concentratedly and vividly demonstrated and proved that the socialist system has unparalleled superiority and unlimited vitality over the capitalist system, and that the socialist world is more advanced and powerful than the capitalist world.

    It should also be pointed out that because artificial satellites can only be launched on the basis of intercontinental missiles, this scientific miracle is also of great significance in the comparison of military power between the two camps. Therefore, in his recent two interviews with American journalists, Comrade Khrushchev confidently declared that he absolutely believed that the United States did not have intercontinental rockets, and that the Soviet Union had also surpassed the United States in the production of general rockets and in the manufacture of new weapons.

    IV. Catch Up with the United States, Catch Up with Britain!

    However, in order for socialism to achieve a decisive victory in the economic competition between the two systems, it must also catch up with and surpass capitalism in terms of per capita industrial and agricultural output. And we do not deny that, in general, capitalist countries, especially the most developed capitalist country, the United States, are still temporarily leading in this regard. It is precisely for this reason that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people have put forward the goal of catching up with and surpassing the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita industrial and agricultural output in the shortest possible historical period. In his speech to the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions on December 2 on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Liu Shaoqi put forward the goal of struggle for the Chinese people, which is to catch up with or surpass Britain in the production of steel and other important industrial products in fifteen years. If these great goals of struggle of the Soviet Union and China can be achieved as scheduled, "the socialist world will leave the imperialist countries far behind." Therefore, the question now depends on whether our socialist countries can catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of economic development level in a very short historical period. The people of the Soviet Union, the people of China, and the people of other socialist countries have full confidence and predict that the socialist system will surely win in this competition. The reasons are as follows:

    First, at present, the total output or per capita output of some important industrial and agricultural products in the Soviet Union and other socialist countries has approached or exceeded the level of advanced capitalist countries. For example, the Soviet Union's total output of coal, iron ore, and wool fabrics is now close to the level of the United States, and the total output of wheat, wood, and sugar has surpassed the level of the United States. Poland's per capita industrial output has exceeded Italy and is about the same as France; its per capita coal output is 1.7 times higher than that of France. Czechoslovakia's per capita steel output has exceeded the level of Italy, Sweden, and France; its output of motorcycles, washing machines, and shoes ranks first in the world in terms of per capita output, and its output of lathes has also exceeded France and Britain, catching up with West Germany, and approaching the level of the United States; it is estimated that Czechoslovakia's per capita industrial output will catch up with the world's most developed capitalist countries by 1970.

    Second, in terms of the speed of industrial development, socialist countries are many times faster than capitalist countries. From 1937 to 1956, the industrial production of socialist countries increased more than four times, while the industrial production of capitalist countries increased only once during the same period. Taking the steel output, which everyone is most concerned about, for example, due to the increase in steel output during the five years of the Soviet Union's Sixth Five-Year Plan, it would take the United States eighteen years to achieve, while the operating rate of the American steel industry is often as low as 80% or less. The Soviet Union expects to increase its steel output to 120 million tons in fifteen years, catching up with the level of the United States. In terms of whether my country's steel output can catch up with Britain, according to Comrade Li Fuchun's estimate, my country's steel output may reach about 40 million tons by 1972 (i.e., fifteen years later). Although Britain's current steel output has reached 21 million tons, due to the slow speed of industrial development in Britain (for example, my country is expected to only need five years to increase steel output from 5 million tons this year to 10.5 million tons, while it took Britain 35 years to achieve the same increase), limited resources, and the difficulty in expanding the market, or even its shrinking, its steel output in 1972 will not easily reach the same level as my country in the same year. Moreover, in the final analysis, the outcome of the economic competition between the two systems depends on the outcome of the struggle to improve the growth rate and level of labor productivity. In recent years, the industrial labor productivity of the Soviet Union has increased by 6%-8% annually, while the industrial labor productivity of the United States has increased by only 1.5%-2% annually. In this regard, my country's figures are also much higher than those of the United States (for example, in 1955, the labor productivity of my country's state-owned industrial sector increased by about 10% compared with 1954, and in 1956 it increased by 26% compared with 1955). In this way, since the growth rate of industrial labor productivity and industrial production in socialist countries is much faster than that of capitalist countries, this guarantees that the distance between socialist and capitalist countries in terms of economic level will be shortened year by year, and will finally catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in the near future.

    Third, in his report on the "Fortieth Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution," Comrade Khrushchev pointed out that in developing the national economy, the Soviet Union has the following five favorable conditions, which make the Soviet people firmly believe that the Soviet Union can catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita product production in the shortest historical period. The five conditions are: (1) The Soviet Union now has a technically advanced and powerful socialist industry and a vigorously developing large-scale mechanized agriculture. (2) The Soviet Union has a large number of cadres with high professional skills, far exceeding the number in the United States. (3) Due to the outstanding achievements in the development of Soviet science and technology, these achievements are being used more extensively in production, so that the greatest results can be obtained with the least manpower and capital. (4) The Soviet Union has endless natural resources, which can infinitely develop the economy. (5) The existence of the world socialist system, the close cooperation and mutual assistance between socialist countries, and the coordination of their economic development plans are conducive to the most rapid development of all countries in the socialist camp.

    These favorable conditions of the Soviet Union, after the two red moons went into the sky, even some realistic people in Western countries could not help but admit it. The Soviet Union's powerful scientific army has made Western countries feel out of reach. It is true that the first four favorable conditions are not possessed by every socialist country other than the Soviet Union, but because everyone has the fifth condition, each socialist country, due to the active efforts of its own people, coupled with the great assistance of the Soviet Union and mutual assistance and cooperation among themselves, has the potential to more rapidly improve the level of economic development. On the contrary, due to selfish and self-interested relations, imperialist countries cannot carry out economic and technological mutual assistance and cooperation like socialist countries to seek common economic prosperity. What should be especially pointed out here is that the achievements of the new technological revolution, such as atomic energy, automation, and electronics, can be and have been fully used by the Soviet Union and other socialist countries to develop their economies; while in imperialist countries, because capitalism restricts the development of social productive forces and distorts this development, the achievements of what Western economists call the "Second Industrial Revolution" have not been used in many ways to serve social progress and human welfare. In this way, the speed of economic development in socialist countries will definitely be faster than that of imperialism in the future. Based on these reasons, even if we do not take into account the trend of economic recession that has already begun to emerge in the United States and other capitalist countries, we can confidently assert that in the competition between the two systems, victory will surely belong to socialism.

    胜利一定属于社会主义
    思慕
    一、事实是最雄辩的
    资本主义终将为社会主义所代替，各个国家将来都要走社会主义道路，这是历史的必然，社会向前发展无可避免的结果。社会主义是正义的事业，代表着社会生产力发展的要求，历史前进的方向，它的优胜之处绝不是邪恶、没落、腐朽的资本主义所能比。
    可是，依靠着这个垂死的制度发财致富的资产阶级却不甘心退出历史舞台，还是极度顽强地、千方百计地捍卫着它，依然做着资本主义万古长存的好梦。在伟大的十月社会主义革命取得了胜利，第一个社会主义国家苏联诞生以后，纵然丘吉尔企图把共产主义婴儿“在摇篮中扼死”的毒手扑了一个空，后来杜鲁门要看到苏联和希特勒德国在反法西斯战争中“两败俱伤”的幸灾乐祸的期待也成为泡影，但直到最近，杜勒斯之流还是自己安慰自己说，共产主义在苏联、中国等国的统治是“一种要消逝的”现象，妄想“改变共产党世界的性质”。至于以资本主义辩护士出现的一些西方论客，现在虽然不敢像过去那样信口雌黄，把社会主义说成是“应该取消的荒唐制度”、“历史的错误”，但还是硬着嘴巴力言社会主义赛不过资本主义，苏联赶不上美国。
    事实是最雄辩的。四十年来，尽管世界和平不时遭到帝国主义者的全面的或局部的破坏，但社会主义和资本主义两个制度在大多数年间还是和平共处的，当然，在和平共处中有矛盾有斗争，而对立斗争的结果，胜负已经分明，那就是毛泽东同志所说的，“现在不是西风压倒东风，而是东风压倒西风”，“新世界的力量已经超过了旧世界”。再以今后的情况来说，只要“战争可以防止，和平可以维护住”，在和平竞赛的过程中，预断决定性的胜利一定属于社会主义，现有的事实就是论据。
    二、社会主义的跃进
    从历史上说，在和封建主义的斗争中，资本主义要经过两三百年才证明它的优越性，成为世界体系；而远在十月革命以前，它已开始走下坡路，在经济发展方面，总的来说，是陷于停滞的状态，有时（例如1929—1933年经济大恐慌）还要倒退。而社会主义呢？当1848年马克思、恩格斯所草拟的共产党宣言发表的时候它还是一个理想，然而经过七十年，十月革命胜利，社会主义在世界六分之一的土地上扎了根，成为活生生的现实以后，这个新兴的体系不但如旭日东升，一往直前，而且加速地向前跃进。在革命前本是经济落后的国家的俄国，仅仅经过二十二年，苏联的工业发展，已把西欧最发达的资本主义国家英、法、德等国抛在后面，跃居欧洲第一位。再过十年，由于反法西斯战争的胜利和中国人民革命的胜利，社会主义国家不再是资本主义汪洋大海中的孤岛，而发展成为强大的世界体系。仅仅三四十年的工夫，社会主义却如此壮大，历史前进的步伐，显然一步快似一步了。
    现在，如所共知，这个社会主义世界体系，横跨欧亚两洲，东起太平洋，西至易北河，包括十三个国家，它的领土占全世界26％，人口约占全世界35％，工业产量约占全世界三分之一，谷物产量约占全世界40％。在社会主义体系迅速发展和壮大的同时，帝国主义殖民体系迅速地土崩瓦解。在战后十二年中，已有十多个国家先后挣脱了帝国主义的枷锁而取得了独立的地位，而殖民地和半殖民地解放运动还在继续加强。这就使得资本主义旧世界更加缩小，势力更加孤单了。即在帝国主义国家内部，也是矛盾重重，四分五裂。正如十二个社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言所指出：在帝国主义阵营内部，“日趋尖锐的矛盾不仅存在于资产阶级和工人阶级之间，而且存在于垄断资产阶级和人民的各个阶层之间，存在于美国的垄断资产阶级和其他资本主义国家的人民以至资产阶级之间。”毛泽东同志说，“现在全世界有二十七亿人口，社会主义各国的人口将近十亿，独立了的旧殖民地国家的人口有七亿多，正在争取独立或者争取完全独立的国家的人口有六亿，帝国主义阵营的人口不过四亿左右。”十亿、十三亿对四亿，这个数字的对比在人口方面也说明了“社会主义在向上发展，而帝国主义却在衰退”。三、给竞赛作出了“总结”
    特别生动地、令人信服地证明东风压倒西风、新世界的力量超过旧世界的论据是，苏联两个人造卫星发射的成功。我们知道，资本主义辩护士除了夸耀帝国主义阵营的军事“优势”和工业发达之外，最喜欢吹嘘西方国家特别是美国的科学技术的“先进”，而嘲笑社会主义国家的“落后”。就是在苏联宣布准备发射第一颗人造卫星的时候，华盛顿官员还表示“忍不住笑”，而把自己计划要发射的一点五公斤重的人造卫星运载火箭先命名“先锋”号，自信也一定领先。而现在全世界都看到，苏联两个人造卫星已经先后飞上了天，而美国的大吹大擂、“千呼万唤始出来”的“先锋”号人造卫星的发射却在华盛顿一片悲鸣、在全世界一片嘲笑声中可耻地悲惨地失败了。相形之下，谁是先进，谁是落后，更加明显地暴露出来。内行的科学家告诉我们，苏联人造卫星上了天，表明了苏联的科学技术在好些重要领域中（如物理、数学、力学、化学、冶金、电子学、自动控制、喷气技术、无线电技术等方面）已经登峰造极，能够解决前人所没有解决的许多复杂问题。再加上苏联在原子能发电站、喷气客机、同步稳相加速器、洲际导弹、原子能破冰船等方面所取得的“世界第一”的位置，苏联的科学技术的发展已经把美国和其他西方国家远远抛在后边。在这样铁的事实的面前，美英的科学家和政论家不禁惊呼，从10月4日苏联发射第一颗人造卫星那一天开始，美国在科学技术方面已经沦为“二等国”，美国比苏联落后十年，连一向大言不惭的华盛顿官员也不得不第一次公开地宣称要努力“赶上苏联”。苏联两个人造卫星上了天，不仅标志着以苏联为首的社会主义阵营在科学技术竞赛中的巨大胜利，而且最集中地、生动地表现出和证明了社会主义制度对资本主义制度具有无比优越性和无限生命力，社会主义世界比资本主义世界先进和强大。
    更要指出，因为只有在洲际导弹的基础上才能够发射人造卫星，这个科学上的奇迹在两个阵营的军事力量的对比上也具有重大的意义。所以赫鲁晓夫同志在新近两次对美国记者的谈话中，满怀信心地宣称，他绝对相信美国没有洲际火箭，在一般火箭生产方面、在制造新型武器方面，苏联也已超过美国。四、赶过美国、赶过英国！
    但是，社会主义在两个制度的经济竞赛中要获得决定性的胜利，还必须在按人口平均计算的工农业产量方面赶上和超过资本主义。而我们并不否认，总的说来资本主义国家，特别是最发达的资本主义国家美国在这方面还是暂时领先。正因为这个缘故，苏联共产党和人民已经提出了要在最短的历史时期内在按人口计算的工农业产量方面赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家。12月2日刘少奇同志代表中共中央向中国工会第八次全国代表大会致词中提出中国人民的奋斗目标，要在十五年后在钢铁和其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或者超过英国。如果苏联和中国这些伟大的奋斗目标都能够如期实现，“社会主义世界就将把帝国主义国家远远地抛在后面”。因此，今后的问题就要看我们社会主义国家能否在很短的历史时期内在经济发展水平方面赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家。苏联人民、中国人民和其他社会主义国家的人民都有充分的信心，预断社会主义体系在这场竞赛中一定获得胜利。理由是有如下几项：
    第一，在目前，苏联和其他社会主义国家在某些重要工农业产品的总产量或按人口平均计算方面已经接近或者超过先进的资本主义国家的水平。例如苏联现在煤、铁矿石和毛织品的总产量已接近美国的水平，小麦、木材和糖的总产量已赶过了美国的水平。波兰在按人口平均计算的工业产量方面已经超过意大利而和法国差不多；它的煤产量按人口平均计算更比法国多一点七倍。捷克斯洛伐克的钢产量按人口平均计算已经超过了意大利、瑞典和法国的水平；它的机器脚踏车、洗衣机和鞋子的产量在按人口平均计算方面都居于世界第一位，车床产量也已经超过了法国和英国，赶上了西德，而接近美国的水平；预计捷克斯洛伐克的工业产量按人口平均计算到1970年就将赶上世界最发达的资本主义国家。
    第二，从工业发展的速度来说，社会主义国家比资本主义国家快好些倍。从1937年到1956年，社会主义国家的工业生产量提高到四倍以上，而资本主义国家的工业生产量在同时期却只增加了一倍。以大家最关心的钢的产量来说，由于苏联第六个五年计划的五年中钢产量的增加，在美国需要十八年才能达到，而美国的钢铁业的开工率经常低到80％以下，苏联预期在十五年内就可以把钢的产量增加到一亿二千万吨，赶上美国的水平。以我国钢的产量能否赶上英国来说，根据李富春同志的估计，我国到1972年（即十五年后），钢的产量有可能达到四千万吨左右，英国目前的钢产量虽已经达到二千一百万吨，但由于英国工业发展速度慢（例如我国预计只需要五年就可以把钢产量由今年的五百万吨增加到一千零五十万吨，而英国在过去要花三十五年才能达到同样的增加数字），资源有限和市场难以扩大甚至日益缩小的情况，它在1972年的钢产量也不容易达到我国同年的水平。而且，归根到底，两种制度经济竞赛的结局决定于为提高劳动生产率增长速度和水平而进行斗争的结局。近年苏联工业劳动生产率每年增长6％—8％，而美国的工业劳动生产率每年增长仅1.5％—2％。在这方面，我国的数字也比美国高好些（例如1955年我国国营工业部门的劳动生产率比1954年增长约10％，1956年又比1955年增长26％）。这样，社会主义国家工业劳动生产率和工业生产量增长的速度既然都比资本主义国家快得多，这就保证社会主义国家和资本主义国家在经济水平方面的距离一年比一年缩短，而终于在不远的将来赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家。
    第三，赫鲁晓夫同志在“伟大的十月社会主义革命四十年”的报告中指出，在发展国民经济方面，苏联有以下的五个有利的条件，使苏联人民深信苏联能够在最短的历史时期内在按人口平均计算的产品生产方面赶上并超过最发达的资本主义国家。这五个条件是：（1）苏联现在拥有技术上先进的强大的社会主义工业和正在蓬勃发展的大规模机械化农业。（2）苏联拥有业务水平很高而人数远超过美国的干部。（3）由于苏联科学技术的发展有了卓越的成就，这些成就在生产中得到了更广泛的运用，因而可以用最少的人力和资金获得最大的成果。（4）苏联拥有无穷无尽的天然资源，能够无限地发展经济。（5）世界社会主义体系的存在、各社会主义国家的亲密合作和互相帮助以及它们经济发展计划的配合，有利于社会主义阵营各国最迅速地向前发展。
    苏联这些有利条件，在两个红色月亮上了天以后，即使西方国家中有些有现实感的人士也不能不加以承认。苏联的强大的科学大军更使得西方国家有望尘莫及之感。诚然，头四个有利条件，不是苏联以外每一个社会主义国家都具备，但是由于大家都具有第五个条件，各个社会主义国家由于本国人民的积极努力，加上苏联的伟大援助和彼此间的互助合作，都有可能更迅速地提高经济发展的水平，反之，帝国主义国家由于自私自利的关系，却无法像社会主义国家那样进行经济和技术的互助合作，求得共同的经济高涨。在这里，特别要指出的，就是新的技术革命的成果，如原子能、自动化、电子学等，苏联等社会主义国家有可能并已经充分地运用来发展经济；而在帝国主义国家内，因为资本主义束缚着社会生产力的发展并且使这种发展畸形化，西方经济学者所称为“第二次产业革命”的成果在许多方面都没有用来服务于社会进步和人类福利。这样，社会主义国家的经济发展的速度在今后一定比帝国主义更快。根据这种种理由，即使不计及美国和其他资本主义国家现已露出苗头的经济衰退的趋势，我们也可以满怀信心地断言，在两个制度的竞赛中，胜利一定属于社会主义。
