Zhu Xuefan said, "We thank the trade union representatives of various countries for their presence and the working class of various countries for their support to us. We will continue to work hard to promote the unity and unification of the international trade union movement."

　　Zhu Xuefan said, "During the congress, the broad masses of workers all over the country sent congratulatory letters, telegrams, and gifts to the congress, especially with their good production results, expressing their congratulations to the congress. This expression of the broad masses of workers across the country will surely promote the arrival of a new and lasting upsurge in production and construction."

　　Zhu Xuefan finally said, "The task of the congress has been completed. In the future, we must answer the call of the congress with the results of our actual work. Trade union workers must integrate with the masses of workers, maintain close ties with the masses, deeply carry out the rectification movement and the socialist education movement in enterprises, overcome the shortcomings in trade union work and the work style of cadres, help workers to work hard to carry out self-education and self-transformation, improve the ideological awareness and cultural and technical level of workers, enhance the unity of the working class, enhance the unity of the working class and the people of the whole country, work hard and thriftily, and build a new socialist China."

　　Zhu Xuefan shouted at the end of his speech: "Long live the Chinese working class!" "Long live the unity of the working class of the world!" "Long live the vanguard of the Chinese working class - the Communist Party of China!" "Long live world peace!"
