Xinhua News Agency, December 8th - According to TASS, The Hague, December 7th: The Central Committee of the Dutch Communist Party issued a statement on the West Irian issue saying: "The Central Committee of the Dutch Communist Party once again clearly states that it advocates the immediate and unconditional return of West Irian to the Republic of Indonesia. It calls on all progressive and peace-loving Dutch people to support the struggle of the Indonesian people, and demands that the Dutch government, on the basis of negotiations with the Indonesian government, immediately return West Irian to the Republic of Indonesia, and at the same time abandon any interference in Indonesian affairs.
The Central Committee of the Dutch Communist Party pointed out that the Dutch government's policy on the West Irian issue is against Indonesian sovereignty and poses a great danger to universal peace. At the same time, the Dutch government's policy is causing great losses to the interests of the Dutch people, because the Dutch people need to live in friendship with the Indonesian people on the basis of complete equality, mutual respect for independence, and stopping any attempt by colonialists to carry out armed intervention in Indonesia. The Dutch government bears full responsibility for the current serious situation.
The Central Committee of the Dutch Communist Party pays tribute to the Indonesian people and the Central Committee of the Communist Party, and assures them of its solidarity in their struggle against Dutch imperialism.
Xinhua News Agency, December 8th, The Hague: The Dutch Navy Department announced on the 7th that it had decided to send a second destroyer, the "Drenthe," to West Irian. This destroyer will set sail soon.
Last week, the Netherlands sent a destroyer to West Irian, and now this warship has arrived in the waters near Indonesia.
Reports say that a Dutch submarine destroyer, the "Groningen," is approaching Singapore, a region near Indonesian territory. A fast ship, the "Van Namon," is also "cruising near West Irian."
A Dutch naval spokesperson did not mention the military and provocative nature of this decision, saying that the mission of these warships "includes protecting ships of the Dutch Royal Rotterdam Lloyd shipping company withdrawing from Indonesia" and "preparing to help Dutch citizens withdraw from Indonesia."

　　把西伊里安交还原主
　  荷兰派遣军舰向印度尼西亚挑衅
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社海牙7日讯：荷兰共产党中央委员会就西伊里安问题发表声明说：“荷兰共产党中央委员会再一次明确声明，它主张立即无条件地把西伊里安交给印度尼西亚共和国。它号召一切进步的和爱好和平的荷兰人支持印度尼西亚人民的斗争，并且要求荷兰政府在同印度尼西亚政府谈判的基础上，立即把西伊里安交给印度尼西亚共和国，同时放弃对印度尼西亚事务的任何干涉。
    荷兰共产党中央委员会指出，荷兰政府在西伊里安问题上的政策是反对印度尼西亚的主权的，并且对普遍和平具有很大危险。同时，荷兰政府的政策正在给荷兰人民的利益带来很大损失，因为荷兰人民需要同印度尼西亚人民在完全平等、互相尊重独立和制止殖民主义者对印度尼西亚进行武装干涉的任何企图的基础上友好相处。荷兰政府要对目前的严重局势负完全责任。
    荷兰共产党中央委员会向印度尼西亚人民和共产党中央委员会致敬，并且保证声援他们反对荷兰帝国主义的斗争。
    新华社8日讯　海牙消息：荷兰海军部7日宣布，它决定派遣第二艘驱逐舰——“德伦特号”开赴西伊里安。这艘驱逐舰很快就要启程。
    上星期，荷兰已经向西伊里安派出了一艘驱逐舰，现在这艘军舰已经到达印度尼西亚附近海面。
    有消息说：荷兰有一艘潜艇驱逐舰“哥罗宁根号”正在靠近印度尼西亚领土的新加坡地区。一艘快速舰“范纳蒙号”也“在西伊里安附近游弋中”。
    荷兰海军发言人没有谈到这一决定的军事挑衅性质，他说，派出的这些军舰的任务“包括保护从印度尼西亚撤退的荷兰皇家轮船公司的船只”和“准备帮助荷兰公民从印度尼西亚撤退”。
