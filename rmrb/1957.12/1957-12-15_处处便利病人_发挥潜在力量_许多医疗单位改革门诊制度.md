(Reported by this newspaper) During the upsurge of rectification and reform, some hospitals and clinics in eight or nine provinces and cities including Shandong, Henan, Heilongjiang, and Beijing have successively reformed their outpatient systems based on the principle of making it convenient for patients to seek medical treatment.

The Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical College, starting from November 25th, changed its outpatient hours from seven hours a day to twelve hours and relaxed the conditions for emergency treatment. Outpatient hours are now from 8:00 am to 8:00 pm, with the emergency room open on Sundays. The neurology, otolaryngology, and traditional Chinese medicine departments, which have particularly limited manpower, have also changed from the original four to six hours of outpatient service to eight hours, basically ensuring that patients are seen as soon as they arrive. To improve the quality of outpatient service, each department also rotates senior physicians and professors to work in the outpatient department. After the Third People's Hospital of Henan Province implemented a three-shift outpatient system on November 22nd, it abolished the emergency room and replaced it with an on-duty room. From 8:00 am to 8:00 pm every day, resources are allocated to facilitate patients' medical treatment. The hospital also merged the previous pricing, charging, and dispensing areas together to simplify procedures, and set up an information desk to guide patients to see a doctor.

The Hejian County Hospital in Hebei Province, starting on October 20th, changed its work schedule, which had previously been the same as other agencies in the county. Now, outpatient hours are from 8:30 am to 7:00 pm, with no break at noon and no closing on Sundays. At the same time, based on the rural living habits of the county, with more patients seeking medical treatment in the morning and on market days, and fewer people in the afternoon, and the fact that the hospital outpatient department has only ten staff members, the staff was divided into main and deputy shifts. The morning is the main shift, with all staff working, and the afternoon is the deputy shift, with half the staff working on a rotating basis. This not only extends the outpatient hours but also does not increase the working hours of medical staff, and also improves work efficiency. In the past month, the number of outpatient visits has increased by more than 10%.

The Hongxing Township Clinic in Nanyuan District, Beijing, based on the habit of farmers who like to see a doctor in the cool morning in summer and in the warm noon in winter, changed its outpatient hours from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm starting in November, with no break at noon. This has greatly facilitated farmers' medical treatment and met their needs. The Qinghe Woolen Mill Health Center in Beijing, in order to adapt to the three-shift rotation production of the factory's workers, added a night shift from 8:00 pm to 12:00 am to diagnose and treat people who cannot see a doctor during the day.

Although these reforms have been implemented for a short time, they are based on thorough debates and have a solid mass base. Detailed calculations have been made, and the potential has been fully tapped. Therefore, since the trial implementation, great results have been achieved. For example, the refractive examination in the ophthalmology department of the Third People's Hospital of Henan Province was already booked until December 28th. After the implementation of the three-shift outpatient service, not only could the originally scheduled patients have their examinations earlier, but the number of treatments also increased, achieving immediate consultation and doubling efficiency. Gastrointestinal fluoroscopy in the radiology department was already booked until January of next year. In the past, only one patient could be fluoroscoped per day, but now it can be increased to three to four patients, shortening the appointment time and increasing efficiency by more than three times. At the same time, 75% of those who come to see a doctor in the evening are workers, cadres, and students, which greatly reduces the time they spend on seeing a doctor, affecting production, work, and study. The outpatient department of the Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical College has been experiencing serious congestion for several years. After changing the outpatient hours, the congestion at the entrance of the hospital disappeared, and there were no more patients waiting in the middle of the night to register. The number of outpatient visits has also increased by more than 20%.

The outpatient reforms have been warmly welcomed by the masses. For example, after the Third People's Hospital of Henan Province implemented the three-shift outpatient system, at 5:00 pm on November 26th, an old farmer came from a village more than fifty miles south of Xinxiang City. He originally planned to go to the hospital first to see when he could see a doctor and then find a hotel to stay and wait for medical treatment. As a result, he saw a doctor as soon as he arrived, and he was so happy that he couldn't close his mouth. After the advertisement for the Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical College changing its outpatient hours was published in the Lüda Daily, it immediately received calls from more than a dozen factories and mines, expressing their welcome and support.

### 处处便利病人　发挥潜在力量  许多医疗单位改革门诊制度

    处处便利病人　发挥潜在力量
    许多医疗单位改革门诊制度
    本报讯　在边整边改高潮中，山东、河南、黑龙江及北京等八、九个省、市的部分医院及诊所，在便利病人就医的原则下，先后改革了门诊制度。
    大连医学院附属医院从11月25日起，把过去每天七小时的门诊时间改成十二小时，并放宽急诊条件，门诊时间为上午八时至下午八时，星期日开放急诊室。人力特别少的神经科、耳鼻喉科及中医科，也由原来的四至六小时门诊改为八小时，基本上作到了患者随到随诊。为了提高门诊质量，各科还轮派高级医师、教授去门诊部工作。河南省第三人民医院于11月22日开始实行门诊三班制后，取消了急诊室，改为值班室，每日上午八时至晚上八时，都调配力量便利病人就医。该院还把以前的划价、收费、取药等处合并一起，简化手续，又设置了询问台，引导病人就诊。
    河北省河间县医院于10月20日开始，改变了和该县其他机关一起上下班的制度，现在门诊时间为上午八时半至下午七时，中午不休息，星期日不停诊。同时，还根据该县农村生活习惯，上午和逢集日看病人多，下午人少及医院门诊部只有十个工作人员的情况，划分了正副班，即上午为正班，工作人员全体上班，下午为副班，上班人数为正班的一半，工作人员轮换，既延长了门诊时间，又不增加医务人员劳动时间，还提高了工作效率，一月来门诊人次增加了10％以上。
    北京市南苑区红星乡门诊部，根据农民在夏季天热时喜欢在早晨凉快时看病、冬季天冷时喜欢在中午暖和的时候看病的习惯，从11月份起把门诊时间改为自上午九时起至下午五时止，中午不休息，这样，就大大便利了农民就医，满足了农民要求。北京市清河制呢厂卫生所适应该厂工人三班轮流生产的情况，增设了夜班，从晚八时至十二时，为白天不能来看病的人诊病。
    这些改革为时虽短，但由于是在经过大辩论的基础上进行的，有着牢固的群众基础，算过细账，也充分挖掘了潜力，因而试行以来，收到很大效果。如河南省第三人民医院眼科的曲光检查，已经预约到12月28日，实行三班门诊后，不但原来预约的病人可提前检查，还增加了治疗人次，做到随到随诊，提高了效率二倍。放射线科的胃肠透视已经预约到明年1月份，过去一天只透视一个病人，现在可增至三至四个病人，缩短了预约时间，提高了效率三倍多。同时，晚上来看病的75％是工人、干部和学生，这样一来，就大大减少了他们因看病而影响生产、工作和学习的时间。大连医学院附属医院门诊部几年来一直存在着严重的患病人就诊拥挤现象，改变门诊时间后，医院门口的拥挤现象消失了，半夜来等挂号的病人没有了，门诊人次还增加20％以上。
    门诊改革受到群众的热烈拥护。如河南省第三人民医院实行门诊三班制后，11月26日晚上五点钟，从新乡市南五十多里的乡间来了一个农民老伯，他本打算先到医院看看什么时候能看病，再去找旅馆住下等候就医，结果来到就看了病，他高兴得连嘴也合不上。大连医学院附属医院改变门诊时间的广告在旅大日报登出后，即接到十多个厂矿单位职工打来的电话，表示欢迎和支持。
