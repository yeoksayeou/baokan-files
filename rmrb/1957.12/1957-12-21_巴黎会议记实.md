    Record of the Paris Conference
    Chi Bei'ou
    Dignitaries from all countries gather in Paris
    Aggressor groups hold meetings
    The slogan is to strengthen "interdependence"
    In reality, they want to salvage the crisis
    Partners sleep in the same bed but dream different dreams
    The alliance is on the verge of disintegration
    To cheer everyone up
    Eisenhower presides despite his illness
    But the spirit has already dissipated
    It is not easy to clean up the mess
    The leader wants to tighten control
    The partners want to sit on an equal footing
    The leader wants the partners to sacrifice
    The partners hope the leader will provide alms
    The leader is keen on nuclear war preparations
    The partners are afraid of being destroyed
    Everyone has their own plans
    Many contradictions and differences
    At the meeting, everyone talks at once
    You say East, he says West
    Soviet proposals are attractive
    Many representatives talk about them
    Forced to include them in the agenda
    Helplessly change the topic
    The United States is truly cunning
    Bargaining and offering ideas
    "Let me set up a nuclear base first
    I agree to test the waters with talks"
    This so-called "dual approach"
    Is actually perfunctory
    Four days of arguing and wrangling
    The Paris Conference has ended
    Engaged in some military conspiracies
    Repeating those warlike tunes
    The communique is full of beautiful words
    "Peace" and "unity" are written all over the paper
    But it cannot hide the smell of gunpowder
    It cannot cover up contradictions and differences
    Although the United States is not satisfied
    People need to be more vigilant

    巴黎会议记实
    池北偶
    各国冠盖满巴黎
    侵略集团开会议
    口号是加强“互赖”
    实际想挽救危机
    伙伴们同床异梦
    联盟正濒于解体
    为了给大家打气
    艾克扶病去主持
    怎奈精神已涣散
    收拾局面不容易
    盟主想加紧控制
    伙计要平坐平起
    盟主让伙计牺牲
    伙计望盟主布施
    盟主热中核备战
    伙计害怕被毁灭
    各人有各人打算
    矛盾重重多分歧
    会议上七嘴八舌
    你说东来他说西
    苏联倡议有吸力
    许多代表都谈起
    不得已列入议程
    莫奈何换了话题
    美国到底多诡计
    讨价还价出主意
    “让我先搞核基地
    试探会谈我同意”
    这所谓“双管齐下”
    其实是敷衍了事
    四天争吵和扯皮
    巴黎会议已散戏
    搞了些军事阴谋
    重弹那好战调子
    公报说尽漂亮话
    “和平”“团结”写满纸
    但掩不住火药气
    盖不了矛盾分歧
    美国虽然不满意
    人们却要更警惕
