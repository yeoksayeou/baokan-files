　　Xinhua News Agency, December 17th Dispatch from Paris: The North Atlantic Group government heads held their first five-hour secret working conference on the afternoon of the 16th. After the meeting, the group's Secretary-General Spaak admitted at a press conference that there were differences of opinion among the member states on some issues.

　　Diplomatic observers pointed out that the strength of the Soviet Union and its influence, especially the peace initiatives and warnings recently put forward by the Soviet government in its letters to various governments, were among the main issues facing the meeting on the 16th. Many speeches on that day touched on this issue directly or indirectly.

　　The meeting on the afternoon of the 16th was presided over by the Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Group, the Belgian Spaak. In his address, he called for rejecting the Soviet proposal to establish a broad region in Central Europe where atomic weapons would not be deployed, because accepting this proposal would "lead to neutralism." He also advocated equipping the North Atlantic Group's army in the "most effective way."

　　Norwegian Prime Minister Gerhardsen's speech was directly opposed to Spaak's request. Gerhardsen advocated establishing a neutral zone in Central Europe to ease tensions. He announced that Norway would absolutely not agree to the establishment of rocket launch pads and atomic weapons storage facilities on its territory. He suggested postponing any decision on the establishment of medium-range ballistic missile bases to allow time to study the possibility of disarmament.

　　The Norwegian Prime Minister's proposal was supported by Danish Prime Minister Hansen. Hansen said: "Continuing the arms race will not lead to a solution to the problems between East and West. Therefore, it is necessary to promote the easing of international tensions, especially to pave the way for the resumption of disarmament negotiations and for negotiations on issues that often contain the danger of conflict."

　　U.S. President Eisenhower and Secretary of State Dulles presented the U.S. plan at the meeting. Eisenhower avoided mentioning the Soviet proposal. He announced that the United States was determined to use force "when necessary" and guaranteed to "assist" its North Atlantic allies in this regard with "the most appropriate strength."

　　Eisenhower said that the United States still hoped to reach a disarmament agreement, suggesting that the North Atlantic Group establish a "technical advisory group" to continue "studying" the disarmament issue. However, he also stated that the United States would adhere to its attitude that has deadlocked disarmament negotiations, insisting on making the resolution of the issue of stopping nuclear weapons testing dependent on the cessation of the production of military fissionable materials and the resolution of other disarmament issues.

　　Eisenhower also talked about the issue of "economic cooperation," which is very attractive to the United States' partners. He said that he intended to ask Congress to increase the current $300 million development loan fund by another $625 million, increase the Export-Import Bank's lending power by $2 billion, and suggest that Congress extend the Reciprocal Trade Act for five years and participate in the United Nations' expanded technical assistance program.

　　Dulles then put forward specific proposals on "strengthening" the North Atlantic Group. Dulles still could not forget the completely bankrupt "deterrence" policy, clamoring for maintaining a "retaliatory force" composed of the U.S. strategic air force and other forces possessing nuclear weapons. He advocated establishing atomic weapons storage facilities for the North Atlantic Group, requesting immediate consultations with Western European countries on the establishment of missile launch bases in various countries, and he also indicated that the nuclear warheads provided to Western Europe would still be under U.S. "supervision." He also suggested starting a "unified plan" in Europe to study, develop, and produce new weapons, including medium-range missiles. He said that in order to enable the North Atlantic allies to learn more about nuclear issues in the military field, he would recommend that the U.S. Congress amend current laws. He also put forward proposals to further strengthen the ties between the North Atlantic Group and other aggressive military groups.

　　West German Chancellor Adenauer, when talking about the Soviet peace proposals in his speech, said that although he was currently "unable to comment" on the Soviet letters, he "did not object" to using diplomatic means to find out "what kind of exact ideas" were associated with the Soviet proposals.

　　Adenauer expressed his support for the Western principle of "mutual dependence." He did not explicitly talk about the issue of establishing U.S. missile bases, but generally said that the North Atlantic Group "must generally be equipped with modern weapons." At the same time, he admitted that in West Germany, the movement against the establishment of missile bases was growing stronger.

　　Adenauer particularly emphasized the need for North Atlantic Group member states to conduct "political consultations" on major policy issues.

　　French Prime Minister Gaillard also emphasized consultation in his speech. In response to the attempts by the United States and Britain to establish a "leadership core" and a nuclear weapons monopoly, he said that to strengthen the North Atlantic Group, the principle of equality among member states must be strictly observed, especially in the division of labor. He demanded that coordination be strengthened in the economic field as well. At the same time, Gaillard slandered the Soviet Union.

　　Italian Prime Minister Zoli believed that the political consultations within the North Atlantic Group must be of a "preventive and lasting" nature. He also advocated further merging the armed forces of member states and demanded the restoration of the "military superiority" that the West had lost.

　　Canadian Prime Minister Diefenbaker said that without prior agreement through consultation, no North Atlantic Group member state could be expected to support policies related to regions outside the scope of the group. He also advocated not easily rejecting proposals for negotiations with the Soviet Union.

　　Belgian Prime Minister Van Acker advocated that the West should consider "cautious and limited negotiations with the Eastern bloc." He also believed that the role of the North Atlantic Group should not remain limited to a purely military nature.

　　Dutch Prime Minister Drees demanded that the North Atlantic Group "pay the closest attention" to the situation in Indonesia. He slandered the Indonesian people's movement against Dutch colonialism and demanded that Western countries adopt a "consistent attitude."

　　Turkish Prime Minister Menderes demanded a re-examination and strengthening of the ties between the North Atlantic Group and the Baghdad Pact organization. He also demanded that the North Atlantic Group intervene in the dispute between Turkey and Britain and Greece over the Cyprus issue.

　　The last speaker at the meeting on the afternoon of the 16th was British Prime Minister Macmillan. When talking about Britain's attitude towards the Soviet peace proposals, he quoted Churchill's words: "We arm to parley." He defended the proposition to strengthen the atomic arms race, saying: "Unless we are effectively armed, we cannot negotiate successfully. Therefore, we must reaffirm our strength. Do not be afraid of the consequences of modern weapons."

　　Macmillan went to great lengths to tout the Western rhetoric of "mutual dependence," saying that the current "purely separate concept of national defense can no longer exist," demanding that the North Atlantic Group become a "single defense unit." At the same time, he argued that because Britain "bears certain responsibilities" outside the scope of the North Atlantic Group, the British army must form a "complete system capable of being independently responsible."

### 巴黎会议上七嘴八舌

　　巴黎会议上七嘴八舌
    挪威、丹麦反对建立导弹和原子武器基地　美国继续鼓吹核备战并用美元作钓饵　西德、意大利等国强调所谓“协商”　法国要求平等对待　比利时主张东西方谈判　英国高唱“互相依赖”……
    据新华社17日讯　巴黎消息：北大西洋集团政府首脑会议在16日下午举行了历时五小时的第一次秘密的工作会议。会议结束后，这个集团的秘书长斯巴克在记者招待会上承认，集团成员国之间在一些问题上意见有分歧。
    外交观察家指出，苏联的强大和它的影响，特别是苏联政府最近在给各国政府的信件中所提出的和平倡议和警告，是16日会议面临的主要问题之一。在这一天的会议上，许多发言都直接间接地接触到这个问题。
    16日下午的会议由北大西洋集团秘书长、比利时的斯巴克主持。他在致辞中要求拒绝苏联关于在中欧建立不安置原子武器的广阔地区的建议，因为接受了这个建议就会“导致中立主义”。他还鼓吹以“最有效的方式”装备北大西洋集团的军队。
    挪威首相基哈德森的发言同斯巴克的要求针锋相对。基哈德森主张在中欧建立中立地区，以缓和紧张局势。他宣布挪威绝不同意在它领土上建立火箭发射台和原子武器储存库。他建议推迟关于建立中程弹道导弹基地的任何决定，以便有时间来研究裁军的可能性。
    挪威首相的主张得到丹麦首相汉森的支持。汉森说：“继续扩充军备并不能促使东西方之间的问题获得解决。因此有必要促进国际紧张局势的缓和，特别是为恢复裁军谈判，为就那些经常包含着发生冲突的危险的问题进行谈判铺平道路。”
    美国总统艾森豪威尔和国务卿杜勒斯在会上提出了美国的方案。艾森豪威尔避而不谈苏联的建议。他宣布，美国决心“在必要时”使用武力，并且保证在这方面用“最适当的力量去援助”它的北大西洋盟国。
    艾森豪威尔说，美国仍然希望达成裁军协议，建议北大西洋集团建立一个“技术顾问组”来继续对裁军问题进行“研究”。但是，他又表示，美国将坚持它使裁军谈判陷于僵局的那种态度，硬要使停止核武器试验问题的解决取决于军用裂变物质生产的停止和有关裁军的其他问题的解决。
    艾森豪威尔还谈到对美国的伙伴有很大引诱力的“经济合作”问题。他说，他打算要求国会把目前三亿美元的开发贷款基金再增加六亿二千五百万美元，把进出口银行贷款的权力增加二十亿美元，并且建议国会把互惠贸易法有效期延长五年和参加联合国扩大了的技术援助计划。
    杜勒斯接着提出了有关“加强”北大西洋集团的具体建议。杜勒斯仍然没有忘情于已经彻底破产的“威慑”政策，叫嚷要维持一支由美国的战略空军和拥有核武器的其他部队组成的“报复力量”。他主张建立北大西洋集团的原子武器储存库，要求同西欧各国立即协商关于在各国建立导弹发射基地的问题，他还表明，向西欧提供的核弹头仍然要在美国“监督”之下。他还建议在欧洲着手实行研究、发展和生产包括中程导弹在内的新式武器的“统筹计划”。他说，为了使北大西洋盟国在军事方面的核问题上获知更多情况，他将建议美国国会修改现行法律。他也提出了进一步加强北大西洋集团同其他侵略性的军事集团之间的联系的主张。
    西德总理阿登纳在发言中谈到苏联的和平建议时说，虽然他现在“无法评论”苏联的信件，但是他“不反对”通过外交途径来弄清楚同苏联的建议联系在一起的“到底是些什么样的确切的主意”。
    阿登纳表示支持西方“互相依赖”的原则。他没有明确地谈到建立美国导弹基地的问题，而是一般地说，北大西洋集团“一般都必须以现代武器装备起来”。同时，他承认，在西德，反对建立导弹基地的运动日益强大。
    阿登纳特别着重地要求北大西洋集团成员国在重大政策问题上进行“政治协商”。
    法国总理盖伊阿在发言中也强调协商。针对着美英两国要建立“领导核心”和核武器垄断的企图，他说，要加强北大西洋集团，就必须严格遵守成员国平等的原则，特别是在分担工作的问题上。他要求，在经济方面也必须加强统筹。同时，盖伊阿对苏联进行诬蔑。
    意大利总理佐利认为，必须使北大西洋集团内部的政治协商具有“预防和持久”的性质。他同时还主张进一步合并成员国的武装部队，并且要求恢复西方已经丧失掉的“军事优势”。
    加拿大总理迪芬贝克说，如果不事先通过协商达成协议，就不能期望任何北大西洋集团成员国支持有关这个集团范围以外的地区的政策。他还主张不要轻易拒绝同苏联谈判的建议。
    比利时首相范阿克主张，西方应当考虑“同东方集团进行慎重而有限制的谈判”。他还认为北大西洋集团的作用不应该仍然限于单纯军事性质。
    荷兰首相德里斯要求北大西洋集团“最密切地注意”印度尼西亚的局势。他诬蔑印度尼西亚人民反对荷兰殖民主义的运动，并且要求西方国家采取“一致的态度”。
    土耳其总理曼德列斯则要求重新研究和加强北大西洋集团同巴格达条约组织的联系。他还要求北大西洋集团干预土耳其和英国同希腊在塞浦路斯问题上的纠纷。
    在16日下午会议上最后发言的是英国首相麦克米伦。他谈到英国对苏联的和平建议的态度时，引用了丘吉尔的话：“我们武装起来谈判。”他为加强原子军备竞赛的主张辩护说：“除非我们有效地武装起来，不然就不能顺利地进行谈判。因此，我们必须重申我们的力量。不要害怕现代武器的后果。”
    麦克米伦竭力为西方“互相依赖”的论调吹嘘，说目前“纯粹单独的国家防务概念不能再存在”，要求北大西洋集团成为一个“单一的防御单位”。同时他又借口英国在北大西洋集团范围外“负有若干责任”，而主张英国的军队必须自成一个“完整的体系，能够独立负责”。
