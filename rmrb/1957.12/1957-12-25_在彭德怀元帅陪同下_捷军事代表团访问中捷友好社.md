Xinhua News Agency, December 24th. The Czechoslovak military delegation, headed by General Lomský, visited the Sino-Czech Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Beijing on the afternoon of the 24th, accompanied by Marshal Peng Dehuai, General Xiao Hua, and Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong.

At 2:20 pm, the military delegation arrived at the Lujing Village of the agricultural cooperative. More than two hundred male and female members of the cooperative welcomed the distinguished guests with colored flags, drums, and gongs. When the entire military delegation entered the courtyard of the cooperative cadres' office, the members all rushed into the courtyard, cheering and applauding them, and earnestly requesting General Lomský to speak to them.

Standing in the crowd, General Lomský said to the members of the cooperative, "During our visit to China, we have encountered good friends everywhere. After visiting from north to south and then from south to north and returning to Beijing, we must come here to bring the greetings of the Czechoslovak army and people, as well as the villagers of Vinarice, who have established friendship with you. Today, Minister Peng Dehuai and Czechoslovak Ambassador to China, Mr. Bušek, have come with us to chat with you, talk about your achievements, and talk about the unbreakable Sino-Czech friendship."

The members of the cooperative warmly applauded General Lomský's speech. Then, several female members requested Marshal Peng Dehuai to say a few words to them as well. Marshal Peng Dehuai smiled and agreed to this request and also spoke to the members.

In the temporary living room, the members of the cooperative served plates of fried peanuts and candied sweet potato slices to entertain the guests. After the cooperative director, Guo Rong, introduced the situation of the agricultural cooperative to the delegation, he said, "Our achievements have been achieved under the leadership of the Party and the government and with the help of Czechoslovak comrades." General Lomský was extremely interested in everything in the cooperative and asked many questions with great concern. Finally, he said, "Your construction plan is very well completed. After we go back, we will definitely tell all this to our comrades in our country and to the members of the Vinarice village."

General Lomský presented gifts to the agricultural cooperative, and the members of the agricultural cooperative gave the delegation one hundred catties of peanuts produced by themselves as a gift. Then, the military delegation and the members of the agricultural cooperative took a group photo together.

Then, led by the members, the military delegation visited the cooperative's supply and marketing cooperative, irrigation canal, the "Sino-Czech Friendship Exhibition Room," and the clinic, and also visited the home of the cooperative director Guo Rong and the poor peasant Li Yonglu. When visiting the "Sino-Czech Friendship Exhibition Room," General Lomský wrote an inscription for the agricultural cooperative. At 4:40 pm, the delegation said goodbye to the members of the cooperative.

    新华社24日讯　以洛姆斯基上将为首的捷克斯洛伐克军事代表团，24日下午在彭德怀元帅、萧华上将和萧向荣中将陪同下，参观访问了北京郊区的中捷友好农业生产合作社。
    下午两点二十分，军事代表团到达农业社的芦井村，二百多男女社员拿着彩旗，打鼓敲锣地欢迎贵宾。当军事代表团全体人员走进社干部的办公大院时，社员们一齐涌进院子，向他们欢呼、鼓掌，并恳切地要求洛姆斯基上将给他们讲话。
    洛姆斯基上将站在人群中向社员讲话说，我们在中国访问期间，到处遇到好朋友。当我们从北到南、又从南到北访问回到北京以后，不能不到你们这里来，将捷克斯洛伐克军队和人民、以及同你们建立了友谊的维纳尔日采村的问好带给你们。今天我们和彭德怀部长、捷克斯洛伐克驻华大使布希尼亚克，一起来跟你们谈谈天，谈谈你们取得的成就，谈谈牢不可破的中捷友谊。
    社员们热烈鼓掌欢迎了洛姆斯基上将的讲话。接着有几位女社员请求彭德怀元帅也给他们讲几句话，彭德怀元帅笑着答应了这个请求，也向社员讲了话。
    在临时的客厅里，社员们端出了一盘盘的油炒花生米和糖煎白薯片款待客人。社主任郭荣向代表团介绍了农业社的情况后说，我们的这些成就，都是在党和政府的领导下以及捷克斯洛伐克同志的帮助下取得的。洛姆斯基上将对社内的一切都异常感兴趣，十分关怀地提出了许多问题。最后他说，你们的建设计划完成得很好，我们回去后，一定把这一切告诉给我们国内的同志和维纳尔日采村的社员们。
    洛姆斯基上将给农业社赠送了礼品，农业社社员以一百斤自己生产的花生作礼物赠给了代表团。然后，军事代表团和农业社的社员们一起合影留念。
    接着由社员们带领，军事代表团参观了社的供销合作社、水渠、“中捷友谊展览室”以及诊疗所，还访问了社主任郭荣的家和贫农李永禄。洛姆斯基上将在参观“中捷友谊展览室”时，为农业社题了字。四点四十分，代表团向社员告别。
