The Uzbek gymnastics team from the Soviet Union competed in a friendly match yesterday afternoon and evening (15th) against the second team of the Chinese Youth Gymnastics Team.

The Uzbek gymnastics team athletes achieved first place in the men's and women's team total scores, respectively. In the ten men's and women's individual events, Uzbek team athletes won nine first places, while the Chinese team won two first places (two first places in men's vault). The first place in the men's and women's all-around was also won by Uzbek team athletes.

Before the evening's competition began, Vice Chairman Zhu De and Vice Premier He Long received the leader, coaches, and all members of the Uzbek gymnastics team.

After the competition, Vice Premier He Long presented awards to the winners of this competition.

△ Sportsman Khelmbaki did a great circle on the horizontal bar, spinning like a windmill. During the forward giant swing, he made a thrilling move of letting go of the bar. The audience held their breath for him, but he quickly made a "swallow" pose in the air and landed steadily on the ground. He scored 9.6 points and won first place. China's Qiao Zhenying scored 9.45 points and won second place.

△ Chinese athlete Li Shiming's parallel bars included a back uprise to handstand, front somersault dismount... all showed the lines of strength and beauty. He scored 9.55 points, winning a championship for the Chinese athletes. Yu Liefeng also performed a beautiful Yamashita vault to win first place in the vault for the Chinese athletes (Uzbekistan's Shirkin scored 9.5 points and tied with Yu Liefeng for first place).

△ Soviet female athlete Iskhakova, after a sprint, performed a straddle handstand onto the balance beam. What then appeared before the audience was a beautiful handstand, walking steps, and a handstand with a 360-degree turn dismount. Iskhakova had previously performed on a ten-meter-high balance beam at the All-Soviet Gymnastics Competition, so it seemed she didn't care about the height of just over a meter. Her movements were so accurate and steady that she won first place with an absolute advantage of 9.6 points. Sixteen-year-old Chinese athlete Ma Wenjuan scored 9.26 points and won third place.

△ The female athletes' movements were so flexible and light, they darted between the uneven bars like swallows. Soviet athlete Chukseeva's movements not only had a high degree of difficulty, but also a high degree of skill. Look at her, standing calmly on the low bar, leaping backward, immediately crossing over the high bar, then doing a very easy straddle-up, then gripping the high bar tightly with both hands, her body slightly shrugged upward, and when people looked closely, she was already standing steadily upside down on the high bar. Just when people were worrying about how she would dismount, she did a split and landed on the ground like a nail. She scored 9.56 points and won first place.

△ Yesterday's competition results were:

Men's total score: 1st place, Uzbek team (330.1 points); 2nd place, Chinese team (328.30 points); Women's total score: 1st place, Uzbek team (218.96 points); 2nd place, Chinese team (215.01 points).

Men's all-around: 1st place, Khelmbaki (Uzbekistan); 2nd place, Yu Liefeng (China); 3rd place, Qiao Zhenying (China).

Women's all-around: 1st place, Chukseeva (Uzbekistan); 2nd place, Iskhakova (Uzbekistan); 3rd place, Ma Wenjuan (China). (Attached picture)

　　乌兹别克体操队胜中国青年队
    △苏联乌兹别克体操队昨天（15日）下午和晚上同中国青年体操队第二队举行了友谊比赛。
    乌兹别克体操队运动员分别取得了男女团体总分第一名。在男女十个单项中，乌兹别克队运动员取得了九个第一，中国队获两个第一（男子跳跃有两个第一）。男女全能的第一名也被乌兹别克队运动员获得。
    在晚上的比赛开始前，朱德副主席和贺龙副总理接见了乌兹别克体操队的领队、教练和全体队员。
    比赛结束后，贺龙副总理给这次比赛的优胜者发了奖。
    △运动健将赫里姆巴奇在单杠上做大车轮动作，转得像风车一样，在向前大回环时，他来了个脱手的惊险动作，观众都替他捏一把汗，但是他在空中迅速地来了个“燕子”姿势安稳地飞落在地面上。他以九点六分得第一名。中国的乔振英以九点四五分得第二名。
    △中国运动员李世铭的双杠后拉起接手倒立，前空翻下……都显出了力和美的线条，他以九点五五分为中国运动员取得了一个冠军。于烈峰以漂亮的近端燕式腾越也为中国运动员获得跳跃第一名（乌兹别克的希尔金以九点五分和于烈峰同得第一）。
    △苏联女运动健将伊斯哈科娃，在一阵助跑后，一个屈肘侧手翻就上了平衡木，接着出现在观众眼前的是优美的倒立、走跳步、倒立转体三百六十度下。伊斯哈科娃曾经在全苏体操竞赛会上在十公尺高的平衡木上作表演，看来一公尺多的高度她是不在乎的。她的动作是这样准确和稳健，以九点六分的绝对优势得了第一名。十六岁的中国运动员马雯娟以九点二六分得第三名。
    △女运动员们动作是那样灵活轻巧，她们像飞燕一般穿插在高低杠之间。苏联运动健将丘克谢耶娃的动作不但具有高度的难度，而且具有高度的技巧。你看她，泰然地站在低杠上，身子向后一跃，一下就越过了高杠，接着非常轻松地做了个穿腿上，然后双手握紧高杠，身体微微向上一耸，当人们定眼看时，她已经稳稳地倒立在高杠上了。当人们正在担心她怎么来下时，她一个分腿就像钉子一样立在地上了。她以九点五六分获得第一名。
    △昨天比赛的成绩是：
    男子总分第一，乌兹别克队（三三○·一分），第二，中国队（三二八·三○分）；女子总分第一，乌兹别克队（二一八·九六分），第二，中国队（二一五·○一分）。
    男子全能：第一名赫里姆巴奇（乌兹别克），第二名于烈峰（中国），第三名乔振英（中国）。
    女子全能：第一名丘克谢耶娃（乌兹别克），第二名伊斯哈科娃（乌兹别克），第三名马雯娟（中国）。（附图片）
