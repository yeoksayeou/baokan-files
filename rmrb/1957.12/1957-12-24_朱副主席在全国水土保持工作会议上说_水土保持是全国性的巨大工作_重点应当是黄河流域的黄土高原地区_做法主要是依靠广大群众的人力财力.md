Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd: Vice Chairman Zhu De said, "Carrying out soil and water conservation work, controlling and preventing soil erosion, is a decisive measure to fundamentally control water and drought disasters in our country and rapidly develop agricultural production. This work must be greatly strengthened."

Vice Chairman Zhu De made this request at the Second National Soil and Water Conservation Work Conference. On December 19th, he delivered a speech at this meeting, giving important instructions on soil and water conservation work.

Vice Chairman Zhu De said that many mountainous and hilly areas in our country have severe soil erosion. According to statistics, the total area of soil erosion in the country reaches 1.5 million square kilometers, equivalent to slightly less than one-sixth of the total land area of our country. Due to serious soil erosion, soil fertility in soil erosion areas declines year by year, water storage capacity is greatly reduced, and there are either droughts or floods, so crop yields are greatly reduced; in the lower reaches of various rivers, because the riverbed is silted up with sediment, a large river flow easily causes dike breaches and collapses, which seriously threaten agricultural production, transportation, and so on in the plains areas. Our country suffers from water disasters on tens of millions to hundreds of millions of mu of cultivated land every year; tens of millions to hundreds of millions of mu of cultivated land suffer from drought disasters, fundamentally caused by soil erosion.

Vice Chairman Zhu De pointed out: The Party and the government attach great importance to soil and water conservation work. Since liberation, as a result of the Party and the government actively leading the broad masses of people to carry out soil and water conservation work, the area of soil erosion that can now be controlled has reached 190,000 square kilometers. This achievement cannot be underestimated. First of all, it has enhanced the confidence of the broad masses of people in controlling soil erosion. People have seen the results and are willing to do it; secondly, and more importantly, many successful typical experiences have been created in soil and water conservation work, which has prepared the conditions for further carrying out this work.

However, the areas where soil erosion can already be controlled are still a small part, and soil erosion is still very serious in other vast areas, especially in the provinces of the Yellow River Basin. Therefore, soil and water conservation work must be greatly strengthened.

Vice Chairman Zhu De said that the focus of soil and water conservation work should be the Loess Plateau region of the Yellow River Basin. In these areas, soil erosion occurs when it rains, and droughts occur when it does not rain. Local agricultural production is affected, and the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River are threatened by floods mixed with a large amount of sediment. Therefore, soil and water conservation work in these areas should be carried out faster, more, and better. If soil and water conservation work in these areas is done well, plus the forty-nine cascade projects built on the Yellow River, the Yellow River will be clear. The ancients said, "When a sage appears, the Yellow River will be clear." Who is the "sage"? The "sage" is the masses of people who have been liberated under the leadership of the Communist Party; it is the heroic models and "experts" who have emerged in the course of carrying out soil and water conservation work. Under the leadership of the Party, advanced figures lead the broad masses of people to actively carry out soil and water conservation work, and the Yellow River will certainly be clear, and it is just around the corner.

Vice Chairman Zhu De pointed out: The fundamental way to control soil erosion is to plant trees and afforest extensively in afforestation areas in mountainous and hilly areas. Planting timber forests, special economic forests, and fuel forests can not only conserve soil and water, but also solve the needs of national economic construction for timber and special economic forest products, and can increase the income of the masses and solve the problem of firewood for the masses. With the increase in special economic forests, it will be possible to correspondingly increase exports of special economic forest products, earn more foreign exchange, and support socialist construction; because economic forests generate large incomes and support many people, the mountain population can also increase, which will be more conducive to the development and construction of mountain areas.

Vice Chairman Zhu De said that according to the general rule, soil erosion is rooted in the erosion of the land surface. Therefore, the method of focusing on the management of slopes, combined with the management of gullies, is correct. Within the scope of an agricultural cooperative, it should be managed from the watershed to the foot of the slope, from the tributaries to the main gully, from top to bottom, from small to large, storing water section by section, and intercepting sand and soil section by section, to form slopes and gullies in a concentrated manner. In the process of management, terracing, dike construction, and pond excavation should be closely combined with the improvement of cultivation techniques and afforestation, forest protection, grass planting, etc., in order to achieve the purpose of storing water, conserving soil, and increasing production.

Soil and water conservation must emphasize doing it from top to bottom, from small to large, section by section. Large reservoirs and other water conservancy projects certainly have a role in intercepting floods, but the most important thing is to do a series of soil and water conservation work in the upstream areas of various large and small rivers. The farmers of Daquanshan Mountain in Yanggao County, Shanxi Province, said: "Water is a dragon, it first flows from the top. If you only manage the bottom and not the top, everything will be in vain." This is very true. Soil and water conservation is a fundamental task. Large-scale water conservancy projects such as reservoirs must be built on the basis of doing a good job in soil and water conservation in order to achieve good results. Otherwise, with silt filling up, its effectiveness will gradually decrease or even disappear.

Vice Chairman Zhu De emphasized that soil and water conservation is a huge national task and must rely on the broad masses of the people to do it well. In areas with serious soil erosion, to do a good job in soil and water conservation, 6,000 to 7,000 people per square kilometer are needed. In this way, without the strength of the masses, this work cannot be done well. In fact, the development of the afforestation movement in recent years, the large-scale water conservancy construction movement launched last winter and this winter, are mainly carried out relying on the manpower, materials, and financial resources of the people. The broad masses are also willing to do a good job in soil and water conservation, because this work is in their best interests. Therefore, as long as we lead them and rely on them, this work can certainly be done well.

Soil and water conservation work must also be comprehensively planned and strengthened. The planning for doing a good job in soil and water conservation must be incorporated into the comprehensive plans for the development of production in provinces, counties, townships, and agricultural production cooperatives, and this work must be carried out step by step and in a planned manner. This matter involves agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, water conservancy, transportation, and scientific research, etc. The relevant departments should, under the unified leadership of Party and government organs, closely cooperate and actively support. Our agricultural and water conservancy experts should carefully study and summarize the rich practical experience of the people in carrying out soil and water conservation work, and help the people do this well.

Vice Chairman Zhu De said that the Party Central Committee has proposed that our country will build a socialist society in ten to fifteen years, and that in about fifteen years, it will catch up with or surpass Britain in terms of the output level of important industrial products. In order to achieve this great goal, it is necessary to vigorously develop agricultural production, based on the principle of giving priority to the development of heavy industry and implementing the simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, in order to support industrial construction. Doing a good job in soil and water conservation is a decisive measure to ensure the development of agricultural production. Therefore, all localities must seriously attach importance to this work.

Vice Chairman Zhu De finally pointed out that the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) has clear provisions on the indicators for soil and water conservation work. Article 13 of this development program requires: "Within twelve years, in all possible places, significant results should be achieved in maintaining soil and water, and the damage from soil erosion should be gradually reduced." Article 5 also requires that through the management of large and small rivers, "ordinary water and drought disasters should be basically eliminated within twelve years." Can this requirement be achieved? This is entirely achievable. Because the liberated people of our country have made remarkable achievements in this regard in the past few years and have experience in doing a good job in soil and water conservation. On the basis of the completion of agricultural cooperation, and after the nationwide rectification movement, with the unprecedented high enthusiasm of the broad masses for building socialism, as long as our leadership in this regard is active and correct, then we are fully confident of doing a good job in soil and water conservation.

    朱副主席在全国水土保持工作会议上说
    水土保持是全国性的巨大工作
    重点应当是黄河流域的黄土高原地区
    做法主要是依靠广大群众的人力财力
    新华社23日讯　朱德副主席说：“开展水土保持工作，控制和防止水土流失，是根治我国水旱灾害，迅速发展农业生产的一项有决定意义的措施，这个工作必须大大加强。”
    朱德副主席是在第二次全国水土保持工作会议上提出这个要求的。12月19日他在这个会议上发表了讲话，对水土保持工作作了重要指示。
    朱德副主席说，我国许多山区和丘陵地区都有水土大量流失现象。据统计，全国水土流失面积共达一百五十万平方公里，等于我国大陆国土总面积的六分之一稍弱。由于水土流失严重，在水土流失地区，土地肥力逐年减退，蓄水能力大大降低，并且非旱即涝，因此农作物产量大大降低；在各河下游，由于河床被泥沙淤高，河水流量一大，就容易溃堤决口，使平原地区的农业生产和交通运输等等受到严重威胁。我国每年有几千万亩到一亿几千万亩耕地遭受水灾；有几千万亩到一亿亩耕地遭受旱灾，根本上都是由于水土流失造成的。
    朱德副主席指出：党和政府对于水土保持工作是极为重视的。解放以来，党和政府积极领导广大人民开展水土保持工作的结果，现在，能够控制的水土流失面积已达十九万平方公里。这个成绩是不能低估的。首先，它增强了广大人民控制水土流失的信心，人们看到了效果，就勇于去做；其次，也是更重要的，在水土保持工作上创造了许多成功的典型经验，为进一步开展这个工作准备了条件。
    但是，已经能够控制水土流失的地区，还是很小一部分，其他广大地区特别是黄河流域各省水土流失现象仍然十分严重。因此，水土保持工作必须大大加强。
    朱德副主席说，水土保持工作的重点应当是黄河流域的黄土高原地区。这些地区，有雨的时候水土流失，没有雨就闹干旱，当地的农业生产既受影响，黄河中、下游又受夹杂着大量泥沙的洪水威胁。因此，应该把这些地区的水土保持工作更快更多更好地开展起来。这些地区的水土保持工作做好了，再加在黄河上修建的四十九个梯级工程，黄河就清了。古人说：“圣人出则黄河清。”“圣人”是谁？“圣人”就是在共产党领导下获得了解放的人民群众；就是在开展水土保持工作中涌现的英雄模范和“专家”。在党的领导下，先进人物带动广大人民群众，积极地开展水土保持工作，黄河一定能清，而且指日可待。
    朱德副主席指出：控制水土流失的根本办法是在山区、丘陵地区的宜林地带大量地植树造林。植造用材林、特种经济林和薪炭林，不仅能够保持水土，还能解决国民经济建设对木材和特种经济林木产品的需要问题，并可增加群众的收入，解决群众的烧柴困难。特种经济林木增多了，便能相应地增加出口的特种经济林木产品，换取更多的外汇，支援社会主义建设；因为经济林木收入大，养的人多，山区人口也能增加，这样，便会更有利于山区的开发和建设。
    朱德副主席说，根据一般的规律，土地表面被侵蚀是水土流失的根源。因此，以坡地的治理为主，结合沟壑治理的方法是正确的。在一个农业社的范围内，应该从分水岭到坡脚，从支毛沟到干沟，由上而下，由小到大，节节蓄水，分段拦沙、拦土，成坡成沟地集中治理。在治理过程中，要把修梯田、地埂、挖塘同改进耕作技术和造林、护林、种草等等密切地结合起来，以便达到蓄水保土、增加生产的目的。
    水土保持必须强调由上而下，由小到大，逐段逐条地来做。大的水库等水利工程在拦蓄洪水上当然有作用，但是最重要的还是要在各条大小河流的上游地区做好一系列的水土保持工作。山西阳高县大泉山的农民说：“水是一条龙，先从顶上行，治下不治上，万事一场空。”这是说得很对的。水土保持是根本性的工作，水库等大型水利工程必须建立在做好水土保持的基础上，才能收到良好的效果，否则，泥沙充塞，它的效能将要逐渐地降低甚至消灭。
    朱德副主席强调指出：水土保持是一个全国性的巨大工作，必须依靠广大人民群众，大家动手，才能做好。在严重的水土流失地区，要搞好水土保持，每平方公里就需要六千到七千个人工。这样看来，离开群众的力量，这个工作是绝对做不好的。事实上，几年来植树造林运动的开展，前冬去春和今年冬季展开的大规模的兴修水利运动，都主要是依靠人民群众的人力、物力和财力进行的。广大群众也是愿意做好水土保持工作的，因为这个工作符合他们的切身利益，因此，只要领导他们依靠他们，这个工作一定能够做好。
    水土保持工作还必须全面规划，加强领导。必须把做好水土保持工作的规划，订到各省、各县、各乡和各个农业生产合作社发展生产的综合规划中去，并且要有步骤、有计划地进行这个工作。这件事牵涉到农业、林业、畜牧业、水利、交通和科学研究等各个方面，各有关部门应当在党政机关的统一领导下，密切配合，积极支援。我国的农业和水利专家，应当很好地研究和总结人民群众开展水土保持工作的丰富的实践经验，帮助人民群众做好这件事情。
    朱德副主席说，党中央已经提出，我国要在十年到十五年内建成社会主义社会，并且要在十五年左右的时间内，在重要工业产品的产量水平方面，赶上或者超过英国。为了达到这个伟大目标，必须根据在优先发展重工业的基础上，实行发展工业和发展农业同时并举的方针，大力发展农业生产，以支援工业建设。而做好水土保持工作，又是保证发展农业生产的一项有决定意义的措施，因此，各地必须把这个工作认真地重视起来。
    朱德副主席最后指出：关于水土保持工作的指标，全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）已有明确规定。这个发展纲要的第十三条要求：“在十二年内，在一切可能的地方，显著地收到保持水土的功效，逐步减少水土流失的损害。”第五条中又要求通过对大小河流的治理，“在十二年内，基本上消灭普通的水灾和旱灾”。这个要求能不能实现呢？这是完全可以实现的。因为获得了解放的我国人民，在过去几年中已经在这方面做出了显著的成绩，并且有了做好水土保持工作的经验。在农业合作化已经完成的基础上，在经过全民的整风运动，广大群众建设社会主义的积极性空前高涨的情况下，只要我们在这方面的领导是积极的，正确的，那么做好水土保持工作是完全有把握的。
