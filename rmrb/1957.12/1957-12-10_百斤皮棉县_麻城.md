Hundred-Jin Cotton County—Macheng

    The 130,000 mu of cotton in Macheng County, Hubei Province, this year, averaged 103 jin of ginned cotton per mu, reaching the target set by the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) ten years ahead of schedule.

    Macheng County is located at the southern foot of the Dabie Mountains. More than two-thirds of the county's arable land is in mountainous and hilly areas, with insufficient water and fertilizer resources, and other natural conditions are not favorable. This autumn, just when the cotton was forming bolls, the county experienced a continuous drought of eighty days, but the people of Macheng County overcame nature and disasters, ensuring this year's bumper harvest.

    Right: "Having lived such a long life and grown cotton for fifty years, this is the first time I've seen so much and such good cotton," said seventy-year-old Mei Heting happily.

    Lower Left: The cotton harvest is abundant, selling a large amount of good cotton to the state. This is the cotton about to be shipped to Hankou.

    Lower Right: Lin Shimeng, the Party branch secretary of the "May 1st" Agricultural Cooperative No. 2 in Macheng County, created a rare national record of 1,764 jin per mu of cotton and wheat in his 2.2 mu double-cropping experimental field this year (540 jin of wheat per mu, 1,224 jin of seed cotton). These are labor models from Macheng County learning about the high-yield experience of cotton and wheat double-cropping from Lin Shimeng (second from the right).

    百斤皮棉县——麻城
    湖北省麻城县今年的十三万亩棉花，平均亩产皮棉一百零三斤，提前十年达到全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）规定的指标。
    麻城县位于大别山南麓，全县有三分之二以上的耕地在山区和丘陵地带，水源、肥源不充裕，其它自然条件也不优越。今年秋季，正当棉花结桃的时候，全县连续大旱八十天，但是麻城县人民战胜了自然和灾害，保证了今年的丰收。
    右：“活了这样大的年纪，种了五十年的棉花，还是第一次见到这么多、这么好的棉花。”七十岁的老爹梅鹤亭高兴地说。
    下左：棉花丰收了，把大批好棉卖给国家。这是即将运往汉口的棉花。
    下右：中共麻城县“五一”农业二社的支部书记林世猛，今年在他的二亩二分棉麦两熟试验田里，创造了亩产棉麦一千七百六十四斤的全国少见的纪录（小麦每亩五百四十斤，籽棉一千二百二十四斤）。这是麻城县的劳模们在向林世猛（右二）了解棉麦两熟的丰产经验。
