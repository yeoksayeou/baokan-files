Soviet Academician Joffe believes that the characteristics of Soviet science are: the adoption of advanced research methods based on dialectical materialism; the collectivity of labor of scientists in various specialties; and the participation of all nationalities in the Soviet Union in scientific creation. Many major issues have been put on the agenda, and a bright future lies ahead.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 5th: Soviet scientist and Academician of the Academy of Sciences, Joffe, recently published an article in "Pravda" stating that the characteristic of Soviet science is its adoption of advanced research methods based on dialectical materialism. One manifestation of this method is to regard science as a whole. Dividing science into various departments is a practice under certain conditions and is often temporary in nature. In this way, many new departments emerge in the field of science. Each such scientific department requires the interlocking labor and connection of scientists with different specialties.

He also said that experience has proven that it is these marginal scientific departments that become the source of new ideas, and they develop particularly rapidly.

Joffe pointed out that in the era of Soviet power, Soviet science has grown at an incredible rate in quantity. At the same time, it has also acquired characteristics in quality that are different from pre-revolutionary Russian science and foreign science.

He said that the characteristic of Soviet physics is the close integration of theory and practice. If we trace the development of any branch of Soviet physics (from nuclear physics and optics to semiconductor physics and low-temperature physics), we can find that physics constantly generates new technologies, which are achieved through the development of theory, and each practical application in turn raises many new problems with theoretical significance.

Joffe spoke of another characteristic of Soviet science, which is the collectivity of the labor of scientists of various specialties. He said that in this way, we can solve major problems that go beyond the scope of a scientific department. And being able to raise these issues and solve them effectively is due to the planned nature of Soviet science and the fact that science has become an integral part of our lives.

Joffe said that another characteristic that must be pointed out is that all nationalities in the Soviet Union participate in scientific creation. This is a manifestation of the friendship of our nationalities and their unity in striving to achieve common great goals.

Joffe then talked about the brilliant achievements of Soviet scientists in recent years, including achievements in the utilization of atomic energy, the creation of the "Tu-104" jet aircraft, intercontinental ballistic missiles, and the successful launch of artificial earth satellites. He said that the acquisition of these amazing achievements is the result of the highly developed level of science.

He pointed out that while achieving these technological achievements, the Soviet Union has also made many achievements and discoveries in so-called "pure" physics. For example, in the field of semiconductors, Soviet scientists have put forward the concept of polarons (free electrons surrounded by charged media), excitons and phonons (the state of high-energy media), and the special state of electrons on the surface of objects.

Soviet scientists discovered the new phenomenon of paramagnetic resonance and magneto-optical effect, discovered new forms of fast electron light radiation and new forms of light scattering (the latter discovered simultaneously with Indian scholars). At the lowest temperatures, Soviet scholars discovered the superfluidity and infrasound phenomenon of metamorphic helium. The Soviet Union discovered new situations in the strength and plasticity of crystals and polymer materials, put forward new concepts, and also established the theory of chemical processes of combustion and explosion. Physical theory has laid a new path for the use of semiconductor thermocouples to generate electricity and obtain cold and heat. Soviet scientists have also created new types of machines for manufacturing liquid oxygen and helium, manufactured ultrasonic microscopes, and found new uses for hydroacoustics.

Joffe said that, of course, these are just a few examples of the many scientific works completed by the Soviet Union that have a profound impact on modern science and technology. The projects of large-scale scientific work in the Soviet Union have increased dozens of times. Soviet physicists are raising and solving thousands of major problems. The speed at which they draw practical conclusions from theoretical research has accelerated many times over.

Academician Joffe went on to say that in summarizing the path we have traveled, one main situation must be pointed out, that is, the Soviet Union has cultivated a strong team of scientists who are loyal to the Soviet motherland and capable of solving any problem. The development of general education and higher education ensures the necessary reserve force for science. The socialist system that has triumphed in our country has created all the necessary conditions for the transition to solving more significant problems of technological innovation and life transformation.

The academician said that in the current scientific work, the problem of the wide utilization of nuclear energy and solar energy, the problem of electrification of daily life, the problems of automatic control and manipulation, and the problem of flying out of the earth's atmosphere have been put on the agenda. All these bright prospects can be fully realized in the near future.

　　苏联科学的特征和发展远景
    苏联科学院院士约费认为：苏联科学的特征是：采用基于辩证唯物论思想的先进研究方法；各种专业科学家劳动的集体性；苏联各民族都参加了科学创造。许多重大问题已提到日程上来，美好的远景就在眼前。
    据新华社莫斯科5日电　苏联著名科学家、科学院院士约费最近在“真理报”上发表文章说，苏联科学的特征在于它采用的是基于辩证唯物论思想的先进研究方法。这种方法的表现之一是把科学看成一个整体。而把科学分成各个部门是在一定条件下的做法，而且常常是暂时性质的。这样，在科学领域里就出现许许多多新的部门。每一个这样的科学部门都需要具有不同专长的科学家们相互交错的劳动和联系。
    他又说，经验证明，正是这些边缘科学部门成为新思想产生的泉源，它们发展得特别迅速。
    约费指出，在苏维埃政权的年代中，苏联的科学在数量上以难以置信的速度增长了起来。同时，它在质量上也获得了不同于革命前的俄国科学和外国科学的特征。
    他说，苏联物理学的特征是理论与实际的紧密结合。如果追溯苏联任何一个物理部门的发展情况（从原子核物理学和光学到半导体物理学和低温物理学），那么就可以发现，物理学不断产生新的技术，这些新技术是通过发展理论的道路达到的，而每一次实际的运用又会引起许多具有理论意义的新问题。
    约费谈到苏联科学的另一个特征是各种专业科学家劳动的集体性。他说，这样，我们就可以解决超出一个科学部门范围的大问题。而能够提出这些问题和有效地解决这些问题，是由于苏联科学的计划性，是由于科学已经成为我们生活的一个组成部分。
    约费说，还必须指出的一个特征是，苏联各民族全都参加了科学创造。这是我国各民族的友谊和他们团结一致争取实现共同的伟大目标的一个表现。
    约费接着谈到了苏联科学家在最近几年中所获得的辉煌成就，其中包括在利用原子能方面的成就，“图—104”喷气飞机的制成，洲际弹道火箭以及人造地球卫星的发射成功等。他说，这些惊人成就的获得是由于科学水平高度发展的结果。
    他指出，在取得这些技术成就的同时，苏联在所谓“纯粹”物理学方面也有不少成就和发现。例如，在半导体问题方面，苏联科学家提出了关于极化子（由带电介质包围起来的自由电子）、关于激子和声子（这是高能量介质的状态）关于物体表面电子的特殊状态的观念。
    苏联科学家发现了顺磁共振和光磁效应的新现象，发现了快速电子光辐射的新形式和光散射的新形式（后一种和印度学者同时发现）。在最低温度下，苏联学者发现了变态氦的超流动性和次声现象。苏联在晶体和高分子物质的强度和塑性方面发现了新情况，提出了新观念，还建立了燃烧和爆炸化学过程的理论。物理理论给利用半导体热电偶发电、获得冷和热奠定了新道路。苏联科学家还创造了制造液体氧和氦的新型机器，制造了超声波显微镜，找到了水声学的新用途。
    约费说，当然，这只不过是苏联所完成的、给现代科学技术以深远影响的许多科学工作中的若干例子而已。苏联大规模科学工作的项目已经增加了数十倍。苏联物理学家正在提出和解决千百个重大问题。他们根据理论研究得出实际结论的速度加快了好多倍。
    约费院士接着说，在总结过去走过的道路时，有一个主要情况不能不指出，这就是苏联培养出了忠于苏维埃祖国和能够解决任何问题的强大的科学家队伍。普通教育和高等教育的发展保证了科学的必要后备军。在我国获得了胜利的社会主义制度，为过渡到解决革新技术和变革生活的更加重大的问题创造了一切必要的条件。
    这位院士说，在当前的科学工作中，广泛利用核能和太阳能的问题、日常生活电气化的问题、自动控制和操纵的问题以及飞出地球大气圈外的问题，已经被提到日程上来了。所有这些美好的远景在不远的将来完全可以实现。
