    Reproductive Capacity of the "Four Pests"
    ·Rats·
    Both the "house mouse" and the "brown rat" have a very high reproductive capacity. The house mouse can reproduce seven to ten times a year, with each litter containing about four to eight pups. The young mice mature in just over a month, and the mother mouse can conceive even while nursing. It generally lives for two years. The brown rat can reproduce in all seasons, with spring being its main breeding season. It typically produces five to six litters per year, with an average of eight to ten pups per litter. The young rats mature in about two to three months, and the mother rat can mate again one or two days after giving birth. It generally lives for three years. (Li Cuizhu)
    ·Sparrows·
    In northern China, sparrows breed from April to July. Each nest contains four to six eggs, sometimes up to eight. From laying the eggs, through incubation and raising the chicks, until the fledglings take flight, it takes about five weeks. A pair of sparrows breeds at least two broods each year. In the south, due to the warm climate and abundant food, sparrows can be seen breeding almost every month of the year, although mainly from late spring to early autumn. They generally produce three broods, sometimes four or even more. According to this estimate, each pair of sparrows can increase to ten, or even thirty, in a year. (Zheng Zuoxin)
    ·Flies·
    The length of time required for each generation of flies to reproduce depends on the local climate. In the north (around Beijing), houseflies reproduce about fifteen generations per year. In the south (around Guangdong), they reproduce about twenty generations per year. Each female fly can lay six hundred eggs per generation. A pair of houseflies can produce 360,000 houseflies by the third generation, and by the fifteenth generation, they will have reproduced to "1,405,161" followed by twenty-eight "0"s! (Gong Kunyuan)
    ·Mosquitoes·
    Mosquitoes reproduce about ten generations per year in the north (around Beijing), and about fifteen generations per year in the south (around Guangzhou). Each female mosquito can lay four hundred eggs per generation. A pair of house mosquitoes will have 160,000 mosquitoes by the third generation. By the tenth generation, they can produce 256 x 10<sup>18</sup> mosquitoes, that is, 256 million trillion! (Gong Kunyuan)

    “四害”的繁殖力
    ·老鼠·
    “小家鼠”和“大家鼠”的繁殖力都很大。小家鼠一年可以繁殖七次到十次，每次约下仔四头到八头，幼鼠只需一个多月就发育成熟，母鼠在哺乳期仍可受孕；它一般能活二年。大家鼠一年四季都可以生殖，春季是它主要繁殖季节，一般每年生产五次到六次；每次下仔平均八头到十头，幼鼠约二、三个月就发育成熟，母鼠生产一、二天后又可以交配；它一般能活三年。  （李翠珠）
    ·麻雀·
    在我国北方麻雀从4月到7月繁殖。每窝产卵四枚到六枚，多到八枚。所产的卵从产出、经孵化、育雏一直到雏鸟起飞，需时约五周。一对麻雀每年繁殖至少两窝。在南方，因气候温暖，食物丰富，一年中几乎每月都见麻雀繁殖，不过主要还是在春末到秋初；所产的卵一般三窝，有的四窝，或者更多。依此估计，每一对麻雀一年之间可以增加到十个，甚至到三十个左右。  （郑作新）
    ·苍 蝇·
    苍蝇繁殖，每一世代所需时间的长短和当地气候有关。在北方（北京一带），家蝇每年约繁殖十五代；在南方（广东一带）每年约繁殖二十代。每代每一雌蝇可以产卵六百个，一对家蝇繁殖到第三代时就产生家蝇三十六万个，到第十五代，就会繁殖到“1，405，161”后面还要加二十八个“○”！
                      （龚坤元）
    ·蚊子·
    蚊子的繁殖，在北方（北京一带），普通家蚊每年约繁殖十代；在南方（广州一带）每年约繁殖十五代。每代每一雌蚊可以产卵四百个，一对家蚊繁殖到第三代就有十六万只蚊子。到第十代的时候可以产生蚊子256×1018个，即二千五百六十万万亿个！  （龚坤元）
