    Wearing a Work Uniform for Five Years
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Sun Minghui reported: Wang Delu, an old worker at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, recently proposed a valuable conservation measure: he plans to wear his work uniform, which he has already worn for five years, for another five years.
    Wang Delu is a water filtration worker at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. In addition to frequently digging sand, washing sand, and carrying sand, he is also responsible for heavy pipeline maintenance tasks. He often has to dig ditches and fill soil, and often has to kneel or crawl to connect and replace pipe heads. According to factory regulations, he could originally receive a new set of work clothes every eight months, but he did not do so.
    More than four years ago, when Wang Delu received his current work uniform, he bought some dye and dyed the work uniform black. Based on past experience, he believed that white work clothes did not resist dirt, and that washing them more often would shorten the life of the work clothes. In order to reduce the wear and tear on his work clothes, he tried not to wear them when doing lighter work.
    However, over time, the work clothes would still wear out, and sometimes even get torn by steel wire or soil baskets. To prevent the tears from widening, he always carried a needle and thread with him, and whenever there was a small tear in his work clothes, he would use his rest time to sew them up. Now, the parts of his work clothes that are easily worn out are patched upon patches, and have been repaired many times. However, the patches are neatly done and do not look unsightly when worn.
    Not long ago, someone advised Wang Delu to get a new set of work clothes. Wang Delu also felt that he had worn his work clothes for four years longer than the others in his group, and that he could get a new set. But when he received the brand-new blue twill work clothes, he felt it was a pity to turn in the old work clothes as waste. He thought that he should save as much as he could for the country. So, he returned the newly received work clothes to the factory, and planned to wear the old work clothes until the last year of the second five-year plan.

### 一件工作服穿五年

    一件工作服穿五年
    新华社记者孙铭惠报道：石景山钢铁厂老工人王德禄最近提出一项有价值的节约措施，他计划把他的已经穿了五年的工作服再穿上五年。
    王德禄是石景山钢铁厂的滤水工人，除了要经常挖砂、洗砂、抬砂以外，还担负着繁重的管道检修任务。他要常常挖沟填土，还要常常跪着或是爬着接换管头。按照工厂规定，他原可以每八个月领一身新工作服，但他没有这样做。
    四年多以前，当王德禄领来现在这身工作服时，他就买了些染料把工作服染成黑色的。他根据过去的经验，认为白色工作服不抗脏，而多洗一次，就会使工作服寿命缩短一些。为了减少工作服的磨损，凡是做比较轻些的工作，他都尽量不穿工作服。
    但是，天长日久，工作服还是要磨坏的，有时甚至被钢丝、土篮挂开口子。他为了防止口子扩大，身上总是带着针线，工作服上一有了小口，就利用休息时间缝补起来。现在，他的工作服容易磨坏的地方，已经是补钉叠补钉，补了好几次了。但是补得较整齐，穿起来也并不难看。
    不久以前，有人劝王德禄领新的工作服。王德禄也觉得自己的工作服已经比同组的人多穿了四年，可以领一身新的。但是当他领到崭新的蓝斜纹布工作服时，又觉得要把旧工作服缴回去作废实在可惜。他想，能给国家节省一点就节省一点。于是，又把刚领到的新工作服退回给工厂，并且计划把旧工作服再穿到第二个五年计划最后一年。
