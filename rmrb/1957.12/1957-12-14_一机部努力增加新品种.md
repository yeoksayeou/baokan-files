　　The First Ministry of Machine Building Strives to Increase New Product Varieties

　　(Our Dispatch) The First Ministry of Machine Building, based on the tasks and characteristics of the machine industry, has decided to vigorously increase new product varieties, actively produce agricultural machinery and equipment for manufacturing chemical fertilizers, and strengthen cooperation between enterprises to implement the central government's policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results.

　　In the past year, thanks to the promotion of the national production upsurge and the emphasis on implementing the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results, the First Ministry of Machine Building achieved the fastest progress in all aspects of production during the First Five-Year Plan, with all indicators exceeding the plan. The total output value increased by 59% compared to 1955, accumulating more than 37 million yuan of wealth for the country. In 1955, only 8,000 machine tools were produced, while last year 17,000 were produced, more than doubling the output.

　　However, some units do not have a comprehensive understanding of the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results. They one-sidedly pursue "more" and "faster," and are only willing to produce familiar old products or mass-produced products. Their enthusiasm for trial-producing new products and undertaking sporadic tasks is not high, resulting in the implementation of the product variety plan being lax at the beginning and tight at the end, sometimes even failing to complete the plan. Some units also have the idea of ​​"never asking for help," and are unwilling to cooperate with other units. As a result, the equipment capacity of other units cannot be fully utilized, and their own units set up another set of equipment, causing a double waste.

　　In order to further comprehensively implement the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results, overcome the shortcomings of the First Five-Year Plan period, and strive to achieve a self-sufficiency rate of 90% in machinery and equipment during the Second Five-Year Plan, the First Ministry of Machine Building has decided to produce more important new products in the future (the initial plan is to trial-produce and produce 1,800 kinds during the Second Five-Year Plan, and it is estimated that this number will increase). In order to adapt to the needs of agricultural development, it will vigorously manufacture equipment for producing chemical fertilizers and trial-produce agricultural machinery and drainage and irrigation machinery suitable for China's rural areas. At the same time, it will also strengthen the cooperation and coordination of various units in the future, so that the machines produced are not only numerous, fast, and good, but also low in cost.

　　一机部努力增加新品种
    本报讯　第一机械工业部根据机械工业任务和特点，决定大力增加新品种，积极生产农业机械和制造化学肥料的设备，并加强企业间的协作，以贯彻中央提出的多快好省的方针。
    第一机械工业部在去年一年中，由于全国生产高潮的推动和重视贯彻了多快好省的方针，生产上各方面的进步是第一个五年计划中最快的一年，各项指标都超额完成了计划。生产总值较1955年提高了59％，为国家积累了三千七百多万元的财富。1955年只生产八千台机床，去年生产了一万七千台，增加了一倍多。
    但是，有些单位对多快好省的方针理解得不全面，片面地追求“多”和“快”，只愿做驾轻就熟的老产品或成批产品，对试制新产品和承制零星活的积极性不高，以至品种计划执行得前松后紧，有时甚至完不成计划。有的单位还有“万事不求人”的思想，不愿与其他单位协作，结果其他单位的设备能力不能充分发挥，自己单位又另搞一套设备，造成双重浪费。
    为了进一步全面贯彻多快好省的方针，克服第一个五年计划期间的缺点，争取在第二个五年计划中机器设备自给率达到90％。第一机械部决定今后将多多生产重要的新品种（初步计划第二个五年计划期间将试制和生产一千八百种，估计这个数字还将增加）。为了适应农业发展的需要，今后将大力制造生产化学肥料的设备和试制适合中国农村需要的农业机械和排水灌溉机械。同时，今后还要加强各单位的协作配合，使生产出来的机器不但又多又快又好，而且成本低廉。
