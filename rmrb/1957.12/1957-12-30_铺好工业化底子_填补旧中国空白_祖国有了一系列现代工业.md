Xinhua News Agency, December 29th. A series of new industrial sectors have been established in China's industry, which is an important sign that the initial foundation of China's socialist industrialization has been laid.

The new industries established during China's First Five-Year Plan include the manufacturing of airplanes, automobiles, steam turbine power generating equipment, heavy machinery, new-style machine tools, precision instruments, electrolytic aluminum, seamless steel pipes, alloy steel, plastics, radio and wired communications equipment. The establishment of these new industries has changed the incomplete state of China's industry before liberation and created favorable conditions for the technological transformation of the entire national economy.

The machine manufacturing industry, known as the heart of industry, was basically a repair and assembly industry in old China and could not manufacture any important machinery and equipment. Now, it has dozens of manufacturing systems and can manufacture products that could not be manufactured at all before liberation, such as trucks, high-efficiency locomotives, ocean-going ships, automated blast furnace equipment, open-hearth furnace equipment, coking oven equipment, combined coal mining machines, electric shovels, heavy machine tools, geological drilling rigs, coal washing equipment, steam turbine power generating equipment, hydro turbine power generating equipment, precision instruments, and combine harvesters. With the improvement of the manufacturing capacity of the machinery industry, China's self-sufficiency in machinery and equipment has increased from about 20% before liberation to more than 60%. Most of the manufacturing departments now owned by the machinery industry have been developed in recent years.

China's aviation industry, which did not exist before liberation, has now been established. Jet aircraft can already be manufactured in batches. Recently, China also successfully trial-produced the first multi-purpose civil aircraft.

The iron and steel industry, which is the foundation of industry, could only smelt a few high-quality steels and ordinary carbon steels and roll ordinary small and medium-sized steel products before liberation. Now, the iron and steel industry has new industries such as the manufacturing of alloy steel, hard alloy, seamless steel pipes, and large steel products. In 1952, China could only produce more than 180 kinds of steel and more than 400 specifications of steel products. This year, it can produce more than 370 kinds of steel and more than 4,000 specifications of steel products. Before liberation, 95% of the steel products needed for production and construction nationwide had to be imported from abroad. This situation has fundamentally changed this year, and more than 80% of the steel products needed nationwide can be produced domestically. The carbon electrode industry, which is closely related to the metallurgical industry, has also been established in recent years.

The non-ferrous metal industry has newly established aluminum and other non-ferrous metal smelting and processing industries. Aluminum is widely used in industry, and China's aluminum resources are very rich, but all aluminum materials used before liberation were imported from abroad. Now, China has a complete aluminum processing industry from raw material mining to raw material processing. The variety of non-ferrous metal industry products has also increased in recent years.

The chemical industry was a very backward sector before liberation, and most of the chemical industrial products needed domestically were imported from abroad. In recent years, China has established or developed departments that produce high-grade dyes, industrial and aviation paints, plastics, phosphate fertilizers, antibiotics, aircraft tires, and special rubber products. The variety of chemical industrial products has increased by nearly 1,000 during the First Five-Year Plan.

The radio industry and the wired communications industry are also important departments newly established during the First Five-Year Plan. At present, China can manufacture telecommunications equipment, including transceivers and automatic telephone exchanges.

In recent years, China has also established some new industrial sectors in the light industry.

A large number of new industrial enterprises are under construction. After these projects are put into production, new industries such as tractors, automatic control instruments, petroleum machinery, glass fiber, synthetic rubber, and synthetic fibers will also be born on China's land.

Establishing various new industries and filling the gaps in old China's industry is a major measure to change China's weak industrial base. Among the 450 above-quota projects that were fully completed and put into production during the First Five-Year Plan, many were new industrial enterprises that did not exist before liberation. While establishing new industrial enterprises, the existing industrial enterprises were also technologically transformed, and these enterprises have gradually acquired the ability to produce new industrial products.

    铺好工业化底子　填补旧中国空白
    祖国有了一系列现代工业
    新华社29日讯　我国工业中已经建立了一系列的新工业部门，这是我国社会主义工业化初步的基础已经建立起来的重要标志之一。
    我国第一个五年计划期间建立起来的新工业，包括飞机、汽车、汽轮发电设备、重型机器、新式机床、精密仪表、电解铝、无缝钢管、合金钢、塑料、无线电和有线电的制造等。这些新工业的建立，改变了解放前我国工业残缺不全的状况，为实行整个国民经济技术改造创造了有利条件。
    人们称为工业的心脏的机器制造工业，在旧中国基本上是一个修理装配性质的工业，不能制造任何重要的机器设备。现在，它已经拥有几十个制造系统，能够制造载重汽车、高效率机车、海洋船舶、自动化高炉、平炉、炼焦炉设备、联合采煤机、电铲、重型机床、地质钻机、煤炭洗选设备、汽轮发电设备、水轮发电设备、精密仪表、联合收割机等解放前根本不能制造的产品。随着机器工业制造能力的提高，我国机器设备自给能力，已经从解放前20％左右提高到60％以上。机器工业现在所拥有的制造部门，绝大部分都是最近几年里发展起来的。
    我国解放以前没有的航空工业，现在已经建立起来。喷气式飞机已经能够成批地制造。最近，我国还试制成功了第一架多种用途的民用飞机。
    作为工业的基础的钢铁工业，解放前只能冶炼少数的优质钢和普通炭素钢，轧制普通的中小型钢材。现在，钢铁工业中已经有了制造合金钢、硬质合金、无缝钢管、大型钢材等新的工业。1952年，我国只能生产一百八十多种钢和四百多种规格的钢材，今年已经能生产三百七十多种钢和四千多种规格的钢材了。解放以前全国生产和建设上所需要的钢材，95％要从国外进口，今年已经根本改变了这种形势，全国所需要的钢材80％以上可以由国内自己生产了。同冶金工业有密切联系的炭素电极工业，也是在最近几年里建立的。
    有色金属工业中新建立了铝及其他有色金属的冶炼和加工工业。铝在工业中的用途很广，我国铝的资源也十分丰富，但是解放以前所用铝材都是从国外进口的。现在，我国已经有了一个从原料采掘到原料加工的完整的铝加工工业了。有色金属工业产品品种，近几年来也有了增加。
    化学工业在解放以前原是一个十分落后的部门，国内所需的大部分化学工业产品，都是从国外进口的。最近几年来，我国建立或发展了生产高级染料、工业和航空油漆、塑料、磷肥、抗生素、飞机轮胎及特种橡胶制品等产品的部门。化学工业产品品种，在第一个五年计划期间增加了近一千种。
    无线电工业和有线电工业，也是第一个五年计划期间新建立起来的重要部门。目前，包括收发报机、自动电话交换机在内的电讯设备，我国已经能够制造。
    最近几年来，我国在轻工业方面也建立了一些新的工业部门。
    还有一大批新的工业企业正在建设中，等到这批工程投入生产以后，像拖拉机、自动控制仪表、石油机械、玻璃纤维、人造橡胶、合成纤维等新的工业，也都将在我国的土地上诞生。
    建立各种新的工业，填补起旧中国工业中的空白，是改变我国工业基础薄弱的一项重大措施。在第一个五年计划期间，全部建成和投入生产的四百五十个限额以上的工程中，有不少是解放以前没有的新工业企业。在建立新的工业企业同时，还对原有的工业企业实行了技术改造，这些企业也逐渐具备了生产新的工业产品的能力。（附图片）
