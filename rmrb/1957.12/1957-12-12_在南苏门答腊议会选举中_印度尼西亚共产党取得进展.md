Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 11th: The Indonesian Communist Party has made significant progress in the South Sumatra local parliamentary elections.

The South Sumatra local parliamentary elections were held on December 1st. So far, according to incomplete statistics from the election results in Palembang, the capital of South Sumatra, the Indonesian Communist Party received 21,000 votes, an increase of 4,000 votes compared to the number it received in the local area during the 1955 Constitutional Assembly elections. The number of votes obtained by other parties in this election has decreased compared to the number of votes obtained in the Constitutional Assembly elections. The Masyumi Party received 50,000 votes, a decrease of 8,000 votes; the Indonesian Nationalist Party received more than 8,000 votes, a decrease of 10,000 votes; and the Nahdlatul Ulama received 10,200 votes, a decrease of 3,000 votes.

In other areas of South Sumatra, the number of votes received by the Indonesian Communist Party has also increased. For example, in Lampung, the Indonesian Communist Party received 55,000 votes, an increase of 13,000 votes compared to the Constitutional Assembly elections.

The Indonesian Communist Party has made such progress in the face of numerous difficulties. As previously reported, Baliian, the commander of the Second Military District of South Sumatra, declared military separation on March 9th of this year, and this area is under the control of an organization called the "Eagle Committee." During the election campaign, the local military authorities prohibited the Indonesian Communist Party from holding campaign rallies, and some communists were arrested. It is reported that the progress made by the Indonesian Communist Party in the South Sumatra elections under these circumstances has surprised the anti-communist forces in Indonesia.

    在南苏门答腊议会选举中
    印度尼西亚共产党取得进展
    新华社雅加达11日电　印度尼西亚共产党在南苏门答腊的地方议会选举中获得重大进展。
    南苏门答腊的地方议会选举是在12月1日举行的。到现在为止，据南苏门答腊首府巨港选举结果的不完全统计，印度尼西亚共产党获得两万一千票，比1955年制宪议会选举中在当地获得的票数增加了四千票。其他党派在这次选举中的得票数字都比在制宪议会选举时的得票数字减少了。马斯友美党获得五万票，也就是减少了八千票；印度尼西亚国民党获得八千多票，也就是减少了一万票；伊斯兰教师联合会获得一万零二百票，也就是减少了三千票。
    在南苏门答腊的其他地区，印度尼西亚共产党的得票数字也有增加。例如在楠榜，印度尼西亚共产党获得了五万五千票，比制宪议会选举时增加了一万三千票。
    印度尼西亚共产党是在困难重重的情况下取得这样的进展的。以前曾经报道，南苏门答腊第二军区司令巴利安在今年3月9日曾经宣布实行军事割据，这个地区就处在一个叫作“鹰委员会”的组织的控制之下。在竞选期间，当地军事当局禁止印度尼西亚共产党召开竞选大会，有一些共产党员还遭到逮捕。据报道，印度尼西亚共产党在这种情况下仍然在南苏门答腊的选举中取得进展，使印度尼西亚的反共势力感到惊讶。
