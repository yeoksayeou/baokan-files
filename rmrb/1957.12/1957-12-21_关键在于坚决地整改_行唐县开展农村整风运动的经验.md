The Key Lies in Resolutely Rectifying
——The Experience of Xingtang County in Carrying Out the Rural Rectification Movement
CPC Xingtang County Committee
Rectification is the main body of the rural rectification movement and also the purpose of the movement. In the first batch of rectification and socialist education movements, Xingtang County Party Committee grasped this spirit from beginning to end, adhered to the principle of boldly rectifying, resolutely rectifying, and thoroughly rectifying, and fully relied on and mobilized the masses to carry out democratic rectification.

Rectify while Airing Views

From the very beginning of the rural rectification movement, the Xingtang County Party Committee proposed that not only should the spirit of major rectification and major improvement be implemented during the stage of focusing on rectification, but also the spirit of rectification should be implemented from the beginning of airing views and debates, so as to achieve improvement while airing views and debating. According to the statistics of 109 villages, a total of 65,460 correct opinions were aired, and more than half of them were improved during the airing of views and debate stage. The reason why the county party committee did this was because it saw that most of the opinions raised by the masses in the course of airing views and debates were correct, and they were also the issues that most of the masses were most concerned about. Therefore, the county party committee first focused on the issues of cadre work style and internal management of the society, which were common and easy to improve; for some problems that were difficult to improve at once, it first proposed ways to gradually improve them; for problems involving a wide range and could not be solved at once, it waited for the stage of focusing on rectification to improve them. Doing so has three advantages: First, it allows the masses to quickly see the results of the rectification, encourages the masses' confidence in actively participating in the rectification, and further promotes the development of airing views and debates; second, it allows some cadres who have made mistakes to unload their burdens as soon as possible, obtain the understanding of the masses, and actively lead the rectification; third, it can avoid the bias of simply suppressing evil spirits in the airing and debate stage, and it will not cause ideological pressure on cadres in the stage of focusing on rectification to settle all accounts.

In the process of rectifying while improving, the county party committee felt that it must pay attention to solving the following problems: First of all, it is necessary to explain to the cadres the purpose and significance of carrying out the rectification movement, and educate the cadres to take the initiative to go downstairs. This approach unites the masses and protects the enthusiasm of the cadres. Zhang Yongren, a public security committee member and Communist Party member of Xiyuting Village, after being helped by the branch to understand the root cause of his mistakes, reviewed his mistakes of commandism at the meeting of commune members' representatives. Seeing his sincere review, some representatives said: "Although your work style is rigid, you work well, your position is firm, and your hands are clean. As long as you change your commandism, you are a good cadre." Second, the opinions aired by the commune members should be well analyzed and studied. The correct ones should be actively checked and corrected by the cadres, and the incorrect ones can also be not rushed to refute. Because as long as the cadres resolutely rectify, even some wrong opinions will be recognized by the masses. Third, improving work should master a variety of methods according to the different nature of the problem. Such as commune member representative meetings, team and group meetings, individual conversations, big-character posters to express attitudes, door-to-door apologies, spot checks and corrections, etc. The 486 correct opinions aired by the masses in Xisizhuang Village were resolved by using the above-mentioned various forms, and the masses were very satisfied. They said: "This rectification has reviews and actions, hits the nail on the head, and we must run the commune well in the future." The facts in many villages prove that the result of doing so is easier to obtain the understanding of the masses and easier to protect the enthusiasm of the cadres than solving them once in a concentrated manner.

Mobilize the Masses for Democratic Rectification

When entering the stage of focusing on rectification, in addition to the problems that were improved while airing views in the previous stage, the remaining more than 30,000 correct opinions were regarded as the main content of rectification. In order to achieve thorough improvement, it is necessary to grasp the key points during rectification. In the first batch of rural rectification movements, the Xingtang County Party Committee grasped five points in terms of rectification content for general villages and communes: First, ideologically solve the problem of the two roads of socialism and capitalism, overcome capitalist ideas and right-leaning ideas, and establish firm confidence in taking the socialist road; second, overcome commandism, bureaucracy, and solve problems such as violation of laws and regulations, establish a democratic work style of cadres, and improve the relationship between the party and the masses; third, organizationally establish the leading advantage of poor and lower-middle peasants in the commune, purify the party organization, adjust the leading core, and establish various democratic systems; fourth, in terms of policies, focus on solving the problem of non-mutual benefit of agricultural tools, forest trees, etc. entering the commune; fifth, in terms of production management, adjust the production scale of the commune and team, and improve and improve the management level of labor and finance.

After the rectification content is determined, how to carry out the rectification? The general method adopted by each village and commune is to take the party branch as the core, and absorb commune cadres, youth, women cadres, and respected old peasants and mass activists to participate together to study and improve work. In terms of specific practices, first analyze and study the opinions aired by the masses, draft a rectification plan, and then organize the masses to conduct debates. After the opinions are consistent, the problems are handed over to the commune committee and other relevant departments for handling and execution. From the effect of doing so, there are two major benefits: First, doing so has a wider range of democracy than rectification conducted solely by the party branch or commune committee. After the Dongyiqu Village Branch absorbed impartial old peasants to participate in the rectification, because the masses believed in these old peasants, only one or two days of work cleared up 38 problems. Second, after sorting out the rectification plan, handing it over to the masses for airing and debate not only saves the masses' meeting time, but also is a good way to follow the mass line. Many problems have been solved quickly and well after airing and debate by the masses. The commune cadres of the Beichengzai Agricultural Cooperative handed over the proposed rectification opinions to the masses for airing and debate. Most of the 422 commune members in the entire commune actively participated in the rectification. They said: "If the commune cadres ask the masses for ideas, they will definitely be able to improve it." Once, the commune cadres proposed that in the future, cadres should participate in production, and the cadre subsidy should be controlled to account for 0.88% of the total annual workdays, but no specific measures were proposed. The commune members said: "This kind of rectification is too rough, we have to refine it." After everyone aired their views and debated, they came up with four methods: First, streamline the cadres, reduce the original eleven commune management committee members to seven, and reduce the nine people receiving subsidy work to five; second, the commune fixed 6.5 mu of land and contracted it to the commune cadres for labor; third, establish a commune cadre rotation duty system; fourth, reduce the meeting time of cadres. In addition, during the rectification, when encountering divergent opinions from the masses, special debates should be organized in a timely manner. This approach not only improved the work, but also improved the masses' understanding.

Establish the Leading Advantage of Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants

After mobilizing the masses for democratic rectification, most of the problems have been improved, and on the basis of the party having carried out criticism and self-criticism to distinguish right from wrong, it will be transferred to the stage of rectifying the organization. In the process of rectifying the organization, attention was paid to implementing the party's class line policy in rural areas and establishing the leading advantage of poor and lower-middle peasants. This is a very important task in the rectification. This work must be combined with commending advanced party members, cadres, and commune members, and mobilizing the masses for debate, so that the masses can see who is good and who is bad. When the commune members of Baimiao Village discussed who could serve as a commune cadre, the poor peasants put forward four conditions: First, ideologically progressive, resolutely take the socialist road; second, actively work and earnestly implement policies; third, be fair in handling affairs and not be corrupt; fourth, have a democratic work style and be able to consult with the masses. The middle peasants and well-to-do middle peasants put forward different opinions. They said that these conditions are not necessary. A democratic work style and fair handling of affairs are good cadres. At that time, many poor peasants proposed: These two articles alone are not enough. If you do not support socialism and do not earnestly implement policies, a democratic work style and fair handling of affairs cannot be considered good cadres. Poor peasant Qiao Luoyu said: "This spring, the rich middle peasants in our commune took power. Some of them handled affairs fairly, but they did not agree with socialism and only caused trouble, which caused great losses to the commune." After airing and debate in various villages, the commune members unified their thinking. According to the understanding after the re-election of 96 communes, there are a total of 2,622 cadres above the production team leader, and poor and lower-middle peasants account for 72.5%.

Rectification and Production are Equally Important

In the process of rectification, Xingtang County generally paid attention to the combination of rectification and production, and timely resolved the contradiction between leading production and rectification. First of all, the leading ideology of the work team and the township and commune cadres clarified the relationship between rectification and production, and corrected the bias of only focusing on rectification and not production or only focusing on production and neglecting rectification; second, the work team and the township and commune cadres divided the front, and some people were responsible for leading production, and some people were responsible for leading rectification. At the beginning of the rectification, first make the current production plan, arrange production, mobilize production, and then start rectification. During the rectification process, the general approach is to produce during the day and rectify at night, and report and check rectification and production at the same time; third, rectify while improving, and cadres take the lead in participating in production. After the commune members of Dongjiang Village aired their opinions on the commune cadres not participating in production, the commune cadres immediately accepted the criticism and took the lead in laboring. The commune members' attendance rate increased from 70% in the past to 95%, reversing the phenomenon of slow progress in production; fourth, in the later stage of the movement, through airing and debate on the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), the conservative thinking of cadres and the masses was resolved, and the enthusiasm of the masses for building socialism was guided to the great leap forward of agricultural production. After airing and debate, each commune has formulated a plan for the great leap forward of agricultural production in 1958, and launched a water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation movement.

    关键在于坚决地整改
    ——行唐县开展农村整风运动的经验
    中共行唐县委会
    整改是农村整风的主体，也是运动的目的。行唐县在第一批整风和社会主义教育运动中，自始至终掌握了这个精神，坚持了大胆地改、坚决地改、彻底地改的原则，充分依靠和发动群众进行了民主整改。
    边鸣放边整改
    从农村整风运动一开始，行唐县委就提出了不仅要在着重整改阶段贯彻大整大改的精神，而且从鸣放辩论一开始，就贯彻了整改的精神，作到了边鸣、边辩、边改进。据一百零九个村的统计，共鸣放出正确意见六万五千四百六十条，在鸣放辩论阶段就改进了一半以上。县委所以要这样作，是因为看到群众在大鸣大放中提出的意见，绝大部分是正确的，而且又是多数群众最关心的问题。因此，县委就先抓住带有普遍性而又易于改进的干部作风、社内经营管理等问题进行了改进；对于一些一下子难于改进的问题，先提出办法逐步地改；涉及面大又一下不能解决的问题，就等着重整改阶段去改进。这样做了有三条好处：第一，使群众很快看到整风的成果，鼓舞了群众积极参加整风的信心，进一步促进了开展大鸣大放；第二，使一些犯有缺点错误的干部，及早卸下包袱，取得群众谅解，积极领导整风；第三，既可避免在鸣辩阶段发生单纯压邪气的偏向，又不致使干部在着重整改阶段算一笔总账，造成思想压力。
    在边整边改的过程中，县委感到必须注意解决以下几个问题：首先要向干部讲清开展整风运动的目的和意义，教育干部主动下楼，这样作既团结了群众也保护了干部的积极性。西玉亭村治保委员、共产党员张永仁，经过支部帮助认识到错误根源后，在社员代表大会上检讨了强迫命令的错误。代表们见他诚心检讨，有的说：“你虽然作风生硬，但劳动好，立场稳，手头干净，你只要改了强迫命令就是好干部。”第二，对社员鸣放出来的意见，要很好加以分析研究，正确的干部要主动检查纠正，不正确的也可以不忙于批驳。因为只要干部坚决地整改，即使有些错误的意见，也会被群众识别出来。第三，改进工作应该掌握根据问题的不同性质采取多种多样的办法。如社员代表会，队、组会，个别交谈，大字报表示态度，登门道歉，现检查、现改正等等。西寺庄村群众鸣放出的四百八十六条正确意见，就是采取上述多种形式解决的，群众非常满意。他们说：“这回整风是有检讨有行动，针针见血，今后非把社办好不可。”许多村的事实证明，这样作的结果，比集中起来一次解决，更易于取得群众谅解，也易于保护干部的积极性。
    发动群众民主整改
    在进入着重整改阶段时，除了前段边鸣放边改进的问题外，把其余的三万多条正确意见就当成了整改的主要内容。为了作到彻底改进，在整改时必须要抓住重点。行唐县委在第一批农村整风运动中，在整改内容上，一般的村、社抓住了五条：第一，在思想上解决社会主义与资本主义两条道路的问题，克服资本主义思想与右倾思想，树立走社会主义道路的坚定信心；第二，克服命令主义、官僚主义和解决违法乱纪等问题，树立干部的民主作风，改善党群关系；第三，从组织上树立贫农、下中农在社里的领导优势，纯洁党的组织，调整领导核心，树立各种民主制度；第四，从政策上着重解决农具、林木等入社不互利的问题；第五，从生产管理上，调整社、队生产规模，改进和提高劳动、财务的管理水平。
    整改内容确定后，怎样进行整改呢？各村、社一般采取的办法是，以党支部为核心，吸收社干部、青年、妇女干部及在群众中有威信的老农和群众积极分子参加，共同研究改进工作。在具体作法上，首先分析研究群众鸣放意见，起草出整改方案，然后组织群众进行辩论，意见一致后，再把问题分别交社委会等有关部门处理执行。从这样作的效果看，有两大好处：第一，这样作，比光由党支部或社委会单独进行整改民主范围广泛。东义取村支部吸收公正老农参加整改后，因为群众信仰这些老农，只一两天的工夫，就查清了三十八个问题。第二，整理出整改方案后，再交群众去鸣放辩论，不但节省了群众开会时间，也是一种走群众路线的好方法。许多问题经过群众鸣放辩论后，解决得又快又好。北城宅农业社社干部把提出的整改意见交给了群众鸣放辩论，全社四百二十二名社员大部分积极参加了整改。他们说：“社干部叫群众出主意，准能改好。”有一次社干部提出今后干部参加生产，干部补助工应控制到占全年总工数的0.88％，但没有提出具体办法。社员们说：“这种整改太粗，咱们得上上细。”经过大家鸣放辩论，共想出了四条办法：第一，精简干部，把原来十一个社管理委员减为七个，受补贴工的九人减少为五人；第二，社里固定六亩五分地，包给社干部劳动；第三，建立社干部轮流值日制度；第四，减少干部开会时间。另外，在整改时，遇到群众有分歧的意见，要及时组织专题辩论，这样作既改进了工作，又提高了群众认识。
    树立贫农和下中农的领导优势
    经过发动群众民主整改后，在大部分问题已经改进，和党内已经开展批评与自我批评分清是非的基础上，即转入整顿组织的阶段。在整顿组织过程中，注意了贯彻党在农村的阶级路线政策，树立贫农、下中农的领导优势，这是整改中一项很重要的工作。这一工作必须与表扬先进党员、干部、社员结合进行，并发动群众进行辩论，使群众看到谁好谁坏。白庙村社员在讨论什么人可以担任社干部时，贫农提出了四个条件：第一，思想进步，坚决走社会主义道路；第二，工作积极，认真执行政策；第三，办事公道，不贪污；第四，作风民主，有事能和群众商量。中农和富裕中农则提出了不同意见，他们说用不着这些条件，作风民主，办事公道就是好干部。当时许多贫农提出：光这两条不行，不拥护社会主义，不认真执行政策，光作风民主办事公道，不能算好干部。贫农乔洛雨说：“今年春天，咱社里富裕中农当了权，有的办事到公道，但不赞成社会主义，光闹事，使社里受到了很大损失。”各村经过鸣放辩论，社员们统一了思想。据九十六个社改选后的了解，共有生产队长以上的干部二千六百二十二人，贫农和下中农就占72.5％。
    整风生产两不偏废
    行唐县在整风过程中，普遍注意了整风和生产的结合问题，及时地解决了领导生产与整风的矛盾。首先是在工作组和乡、社干部的领导思想上，明确了整风和生产的关系，纠正了只管整风不管生产或只管生产忽视整风的偏向；第二，工作组和乡、社干部划分战线，一部分人负责领导生产，一部分人负责领导整风。整风开始时，首先作出当前生产规划，安排好生产，将生产发动起来，再开始整风。整风过程中一般的又采取了白天生产，晚上整风，整风生产同时汇报、同时检查；第三，边整边改，干部带头参加生产。东讲村社员鸣放出社干部不参加生产意见后，社干部立即接受批评，带头劳动，社员出勤率由过去70％提高到95％，扭转了生产工作进度慢的现象；第四，在运动后期，通过对全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的鸣放辩论，解决了干部、群众的保守思想，把群众的建设社会主义热情引导到农业生产大跃进方面来。各社经过鸣放辩论都制定了1958年农业生产大跃进的规划，开展了水利积肥运动。
