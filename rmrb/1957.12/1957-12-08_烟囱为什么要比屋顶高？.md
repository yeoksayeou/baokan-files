Why are chimneys higher than roofs?
　　Wood or coal absorbs oxygen from the air during combustion, releasing carbon dioxide (commonly known as carbonic acid gas) and water vapor, as well as some dust. To keep the fire burning, it is necessary not only to supply oxygen but also to remove these combustion byproducts. Generally, a chimney is installed on the stove to vent to the outside, and the chimney outlet should be at least two feet higher than the roof. This is because the wind outdoors often passes over the roof. If the chimney is as high as the roof, the wind blowing over the roof will enter the chimney, forcing the smoke back into the room, and filling the house. At the same time, carbon dioxide and other waste products cannot be smoothly discharged from the stove, making it impossible for the stove to continue burning smoothly.
　　Similarly, the chimney outlet should not face north, because the northwesterly wind in winter will hinder the chimney's smoke exhaust. (Qi)

### 烟囱为什么要比屋顶高？

专栏：为什么

　  烟囱为什么要比屋顶高？
    木柴或煤块在空气中吸收了氧气，经过燃烧后放出了二氧化碳（俗称碳酸气）和水汽、以及一些灰尘。要使炉火能继续燃烧，不仅要供给氧气，而且要把燃烧后产生的这些废物排除。一般是在炉子上安装一个烟囱通出室外，烟囱的出气口应比屋顶高二尺以上。因为户外的风常常是沿屋顶而过，假如烟囱与屋顶一样高，那么吹过屋面的风会灌到烟囱里去，迫使炉烟回倒，而充满屋内，同时二氧化碳等废物就不能畅快地从炉内排出，炉子也就无法继续顺利地燃烧。
    同样道理，烟囱的出口处不能正对北面，因为冬天的西北风会妨碍烟囱的出烟。　　　（圻）
