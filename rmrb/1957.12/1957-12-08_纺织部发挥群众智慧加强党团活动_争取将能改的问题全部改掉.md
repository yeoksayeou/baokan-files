Xinhua News Agency report: The Ministry of Textile Industry has launched a rectification upsurge. Since the rectification movement entered the stage of focusing on general rectification in late November, more than 4,300 opinions raised by the masses have been addressed within a few days.

Problems raised by staff regarding professional and technical work, which can be resolved at present, have been quickly resolved. For example, engineering and technical personnel previously criticized in big-character posters that the ministry did not pay enough attention to the research of substitute fibers. Now the ministry has accepted this opinion and decided to include this work in the 1958 new product trial production plan, and sent someone to Tianjin to collect relevant information. An engineer from the Printing and Dyeing Section suggested in a big-character poster that, according to the Soviet method, sodium hypochlorite should be used instead of bleaching powder to bleach textiles in printing and dyeing factories, which would not only result in whiter products but also be cheaper; it was also suggested to reduce the proportion of reducing agent sodium sulfide to save raw materials. After discussion by the Technology Department, these two suggestions were considered feasible and have now been notified to printing and dyeing factories across the country for adoption. Staff of the Wool, Flax, and Silk Bureau had pointed out that the lack of technical standards for gabardine affected the quality, and now people have been organized to formulate technical standards and send them to relevant parties for comments.

While studying the thorough streamlining of institutions to eliminate organizational bloat and overstaffing, the Textile Ministry has also begun to establish systems to improve institutional work and improve work efficiency. Originally, big-character posters criticized some units in the ministry for not reporting back after business trips, or not studying after reporting. The ministry's rectification leading group has decided that working groups sent out by the ministry must report to the minister after returning, and the minister will convene relevant personnel to study appropriate solutions to the problems raised in the report. The General Office accepted the criticism in big-character posters about the slow circulation of official documents and made six regulations to improve the sending of official documents, including increasing the number of document deliveries and limiting the time for opening documents; improvement plans for the distribution, signing, urging, inspection, and file management of official documents have also been drafted and submitted for discussion. There have also been improvements in organizational life and labor discipline. The Cadre Department has stipulated a leave and attendance system. In addition, the management of canteens, dormitories, welfare expenses, etc. has also been strengthened.

The work style of leading cadres and Party members has also improved after being criticized. Some leading personnel at all levels who have been criticized have openly made self-criticisms to the masses, expressing their determination to correct their shortcomings. The Party committee has stipulated a system for members of the Standing Committee of the Party Committee to meet with the masses, and some units have also stipulated a system for Party members to be assigned to contact the masses. Staff members expressed satisfaction with these improvements. The relationship between leading cadres and general cadres, and between the Party and the masses, is closer than before.

The Ministry of Textile Industry paid attention to utilizing the wisdom of the masses in the improvement work, so that many problems were solved quickly and well. For example, the ammonia gas smell in the blueprint room of the Basic Construction Design Institute was very strong, which affected the health of the staff. Although ventilation equipment was installed and many other methods were tried in the past, the problem was never well resolved. This time, after the masses raised their opinions, the institute turned it over to everyone for discussion. After research by engineering and technical personnel and blueprint room staff, methods such as reducing the size of the room and raising the floor were adopted, and the results were very good.

In order to strive to correct all the problems that can be corrected in the near future, the ministry and various units have taken some measures, including full-time division of labor by responsible cadres at all levels to lead the rectification work of various units, and specific progress has been arranged; strengthening Party and League activities, and giving play to the leading and guaranteeing role of Party members, League members, and activists. Units such as the General Office have also organized special review groups to check while rectifying.

　  纺织部发挥群众智慧加强党团活动
　　争取将能改的问题全部改掉
    新华社讯　纺织工业部掀起整改热潮。自11月下旬整风运动进入着重一般整改以来，几天内已经处理了四千三百多条群众提出的意见。
    工作人员提出的有关业务技术工作方面的问题，凡是目前能够解决的，都已迅速得到解决。比如过去工程技术人员在大字报上批评部对代用纤维的研究重视不够。现在部里已经接受这个意见，决定把这项工作列入1958年新产品试制计划，并派了专人到天津去收集有关资料。印染科一个工程师在大字报上建议，按照苏联办法，在印染厂用次氯酸钠代替漂白粉漂白纺织品，不但漂出来的东西白，而且价钱也比较便宜；还建议降低助染剂硫化碱的比例，节省原料。这两项建议经过技术司讨论后认为切实可行，现在已经通知全国印染厂采纳。毛麻丝局的工作人员曾提出华达呢由于缺乏技术标准影响质量，现在也已组织人将技术标准制定出来，送到有关方面征求意见。
    在研究彻底紧缩机构，消除机构臃肿、人浮于事现象的同时，纺织部还着手建立制度改进机构工作，提高工作效率。原来大字报批评部里有些单位出差回来不汇报，汇报后不研究。部整风领导小组已决定由部派出的工作组回来后要向部长汇报，并且由部长召集有关人员对汇报中提出的问题研究出适当的解决办法。办公厅接受大字报关于公文运转迟缓的批评，作出了六项改进公文发送的规定，其中包括增加送公文的次数，限定公文拆封时间等；在公文的分发、签署、催办检查和档案管理等方面也拟出改进方案交大家讨论。在机关生活和劳动纪律等方面，现在也有了改善。干部司已规定了请假考勤制度。另外，对食堂、宿舍、福利费开支等方面的管理也都加强了。
    领导干部和党员的作风，在受到批评之后，也有所改进。受到批评的一些各级领导人员都公开向群众作了检讨，表示改正缺点的决心。党委规定了党委常委委员接见群众的制度，有的单位还规定了党员分工联系群众的制度。工作人员对这些改进表示满意。在领导干部和一般干部之间、党群之间的关系比过去密切了。
    纺织部在改进工作中注意了发挥群众智慧，使许多问题解决得又快又好。比如基本建设设计院晒图室阿莫尼亚气味很重，影响工作人员身体健康，过去虽然设有通风设备和想了许多别的办法，问题始终没有很好解决。这次群众提意见后，院里将它交给大家讨论。经过工程技术人员和晒图室工作人员的研究，采取把房间隔小，地板垫高等办法，结果效果很好。
    为争取在最近将目前能改的全部改掉，部和各单位均采取了一些措施，其中包括各级负责干部专职分工，领导各单位的整改工作，并且安排了具体进度；加强党团活动，发挥党团员、积极分子的带头保证作用。办公厅等单位还组织了专门的复查小组，边改边查。
