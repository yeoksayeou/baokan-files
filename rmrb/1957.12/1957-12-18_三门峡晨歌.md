　　Sanmenxia Morning Song

  　The girls on "Dressing Table" [Note]
    In the morning, I came to the "Dressing Table" and saw silhouettes swaying on the lightly misty stone island. Could it be the graceful fairies of legend dressing up on the platform? Or the imperial concubine of legend resting here?
    I walked through the light mist and onto the "Dressing Table." Ah, they are truly a few young girls! Not draped in transparent gauze, nor wearing gorgeous palace attire, but dressed in simple work clothes; what they hold in their hands are not delicate combs, but heavy drill handles, and the drills beside them are roaring! Alas, busy girls, rash girls, the yellow wind messes up their beautiful hair, the scorching sun tans their cheeks, and oil stains their dark blue work clothes!
    I said, "Hello! Girls on the Dressing Table, haven't you ever thought about dressing up?"
    The young drill leader answered, raising a core sample she had just taken out: "Oh, we are too busy, busy tailoring a verdant dress for the Yellow River!" She also flicked her pigtail and cast a playful glance: "Besides, this empty dressing table has no mirror, how can we dress up? Wait, there will be a day when we can dress up nicely here!" I said: "Then, where is the mirror?" The girl smiled: "You! You've forgotten that the round reservoir will be built beside the Dressing Table!"
    [Note] The Dressing Table is a graceful stone island on the left bank of Sanmenxia by the water. Legend has it that fairies dressed up here, and it is also said that the imperial concubine rested here during her tour of Sanmen. There is now a drilling machine on the island.
    Hanging Drum Stone [Note]
    The black cliff became brighter and brighter, gradually revealing its green original appearance, another brilliant dawn! You, towering Hanging Drum Stone, do you remember that the drum sound has stopped for thousands of years? Do you miss the heroic figure of King Yu beating the drum in the morning glow? Do you know where the drum that summons the workers is now?
    The green cliff becomes brighter and brighter, and is even smeared with a layer of light purple morning glow. You, towering Hanging Drum Stone, is it strange: without the booming of the drum, where do so many bustling crowds come from from all directions? White-bearded boatmen, red-faced youths, braided girls... they come carrying wind drills, shouldering surveying instruments, driving excavators, bulldozers, and dump trucks... Ah! These are all our drummers, the shiny machines, the precise instruments are their drumsticks. Can you see this drum? Your small cliff can no longer hold it. You must know that the entire earth is our drum surface. See the Yellow River no longer roaring, the mountains shaking for it. We are waving our arms day and night, beating the drum of socialism...
      [Note] On the mountain on the left bank of Sanmenxia, ​​there is a protruding cliff. Legend has it that when King Yu controlled the water, he hung a drum here, and every dawn, he beat the drum to summon the water control people from all directions.
    Yellow River Cantata
    In the morning, at the Sanmenxia construction site, I heard the Yellow River Cantata resounding on the banks of the Yellow River.
    Yellow River, in those years of war, how many times have you heard the soul-stirring Yellow River Cantata? How many times have you seen the sons and daughters of the Yellow River emerge from the mountains and green gauze tents on both sides of you, raise their hands to swear in front of you, and set off in the dark of night to annihilate the enemy. When dawn came, they had already wiped their snow-bright sabers with the enemy's dirty blood, sang this majestic song, and waded through your turbid yellow water...
    Now, can you hear a new Yellow River Cantata resounding in the Sanmenxia Valley? Look at how many heroic sons and daughters of the Yellow River have formed such a huge choir, thousands upon thousands of drillers, boatmen, excavator operators, engineers... using their youthful and rugged voices, singing the strongest sound of labor. How many instruments accompany them, thousands upon thousands of drills, motors, excavators, and excavators, making loud and harmonious sounds, playing the prelude to this great movement. Look, Renmen Island is like a huge piano, every shiny black machine is its key, how many keys sound together! Look, Shenmen Island is like a slender violin, using your turbulent Yellow River as its string... This is a new Yellow River Cantata that engulfs mountains and rivers. When the reservoir is completed, we will sing the final chapter of this cantata and cross your clear river...

　　三门峡晨歌
    马锐
  　“梳妆台”〔注〕上的姑娘
    早晨，我来到“梳妆台”前，看轻雾蒙蒙的石岛上，有人影儿摇晃，这可是传说中翩翩的仙女在台上梳妆？还是传说中来这儿休憩的娘娘？
    我穿过轻雾，走到“梳妆台”上。啊，真是几个年青的姑娘！可不是披着透明的轻纱，也不是穿着华丽的宫服，是穿着朴素的工装；她们手上握的不是轻巧的梳子，而是沉重的钻把，钻机在她们身旁隆隆地轰响！唉，忙碌的姑娘，鲁莽的姑娘呵，黄风吹乱了她们的秀发，烈日晒黑了她们的双颊，油迹沾满了那深蓝色的工装！
    我说：“你们好！梳妆台上的姑娘，难道说你们从来也没有想到过梳妆？”
    答话的是年青的钻机长，她举一举手里刚取出的岩心：“哦，我们太忙呀，忙着给黄河裁剪碧绿的衣裳！”她又把小辫儿一甩，投过来顽皮的目光：“再说这空空的梳妆台也没有镜子，可怎么梳妆？等着吧，总有那么一天我们要在这儿好好地梳妆！”我说：“那么，镜子呢？”姑娘笑了：“你呀！忘了圆圆的水库就要修好在梳妆台旁！”
    〔注〕梳妆台是三门峡左岸水边的一个亭亭玉立的石岛，相传有仙女在这儿梳妆，又传说娘娘游三门时曾在此休息。今岛上有一钻机。
    挂鼓石〔注〕
    黑色的悬崖一会儿比一会儿亮了，渐渐现出它青绿色的本来面目，又是一个灿烂的黎明！你，耸立的挂鼓石，可记得鼓声已经停息了几千年？可怀念那禹王在朝霞里擂鼓的雄姿？可知道那一面招唤劳动者的鼓儿如今在何方？
    青绿色的悬崖一会儿比一会儿亮了，更抹上一层淡紫色的朝霞。你，耸立的挂鼓石，可奇怪：没有咚咚的鼓声，从四面八方哪来这么多熙攘的人群？白胡子的艄公、红脸膛的青年、长辫子的姑娘……他们扛着风钻走来，肩着测量仪走来，驾着电铲、推土机和自卸卡车走过来……呵！这都是我们的鼓手呵，黑亮的机械，精密的仪器是他们的鼓棰。你可看到了这一面鼓儿？你那小小的悬崖已经挂不住它了，要知道整个大地才是我们的鼓面，看黄河不再咆哮、山岳为之震动，我们正昼夜不息地挥动臂膀，把社会主义的鼓声擂响……
      〔注〕三门峡左岸山上，有一个突出的悬崖，相传禹王治水时，曾在这儿挂一面鼓，每到黎明，就擂起鼓声，把治水的人们从四面八方唤来。
    黄河大合唱
    早晨，在三门峡工地上，我听见黄河大合唱响在黄河之滨。
    黄河呵，在那战火纷飞的年代，你听见过多少次动人心魄的黄河大合唱？多少次呵，你看见黄河儿女从你两岸的万山丛中，青纱帐里走出来，面对着你举手宣誓，趁着沉沉的夜色出发去歼灭敌人。当黎明到来，他们已经用敌人的污血擦了雪亮的马刀，唱着这一首雄壮的歌，趟过你混浊的黄水……
    如今，你可听见在三门峡谷里响起一首新的黄河大合唱？看多少英雄的黄河儿女，组成了一支多么壮大的合唱队，上千上万的钻工、船工、电铲手、工程师……用他们的青春的粗犷的歌喉，唱出劳动的最强音。多少乐器为他们伴奏呵，上千上万的钻机、马达、掘土机、电铲，发出高昂而谐和的音响，奏出这伟大乐章的序曲。看呵，人门岛像一架巨大的钢琴，每台黑亮的机器都是它的琴键，多少个琴键一齐响了！看神门岛像一只细长的提琴，用你汹涌的黄河作它的弦……这是一首气吞山河的新黄河大合唱，当水库完工的日子，我们要唱着这个合唱的最后一章，跨过你碧清见底的河水……。
