　　The Soviet Union Vigorously Helps the Economic Construction of Hungary, Bulgaria, and Albania
    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, December 4th: The Soviet Union's enormous economic assistance to Hungary has played a significant role in Hungary's economic recovery and development since liberation.
    The Soviet Union's economic assistance to Hungary is primarily carried out through trade. Shortly after Hungary's liberation, in August 1945, the two countries signed their first trade agreement. Since then, the two countries have signed six trade agreements, and the trade volume has increased to nineteen times that before Hungary's liberation.
    The trade agreement signed between the Soviet Union and Hungary in March of this year further provided Hungary with strong assistance. In terms of basic construction, Hungary has built many important industrial enterprises with Soviet assistance since liberation. The Danube Iron and Steel United Enterprise, the largest metallurgical enterprise in Hungary, was designed and equipped with Soviet assistance and built under the guidance of Soviet experts.
    Grants and loans are another important aspect of the Soviet Union's economic assistance to Hungary. The largest amount of loans was provided after the counter-revolutionary riots in Hungary last October; Hungary has successively obtained loans of approximately 1.2 billion rubles from various socialist countries, of which 875 million rubles were lent by the Soviet Union. After suffering serious losses in the counter-revolutionary event last year, Hungary not only did not experience inflation, but also basically recovered to last year's production level in less than a year. Such rapid recovery is inseparable from the assistance of fraternal countries, especially the enormous assistance provided by the Soviet Union.
    Currently, the Soviet Union is helping to build the first atomic reactor and the first atomic power station.
    Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, December 4th: Since liberation, Bulgaria has received enormous assistance from the Soviet Union in socialist construction.
    By the end of last year, long-term loans provided by the Soviet Union to Bulgaria amounted to 8 billion leva, equivalent to approximately 27% of Bulgaria's total investment in basic construction during this period. Bulgaria used these loans to purchase machinery, equipment, and building materials needed by various sectors of the national economy from the Soviet Union.
    In addition to providing machinery and equipment, the Soviet Union also provided technical assistance to Bulgaria in various construction projects by supplying technical data, design blueprints, and dispatching experts. Since liberation, more than 1,100 Soviet experts have worked in Bulgaria in the industrial sectors alone. In agriculture, Bulgaria, with Soviet assistance, has established its own agricultural machinery and chemical fertilizer factories. Bulgaria also continuously receives various agricultural machines from the Soviet Union. By 1960, Bulgaria will be able to complete the mechanization of agriculture in major tasks.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, December 4th: Albania's economic development has been very rapid in the thirteen years since liberation, and Soviet assistance has played a significant role in this regard.
    Since Albania's liberation, the Soviet Union has provided Albania with a total of 420 million rubles in loans. According to the results of the Albanian-Soviet talks in April of this year, the Soviet Union canceled these debts as a grant to Albania. Through these loans, the Soviet Union supplied Albania with complete sets of equipment for many factories, mines, and hydroelectric power stations.
    In agriculture and animal husbandry, Albania has established twenty-two tractor stations with Soviet assistance. The Soviet Union has supplied a large number of tractors, combine harvesters, and other agricultural machines, as well as complete sets of equipment for soil improvement. After the Albanian-Soviet talks in April of this year, the Soviet Union provided Albania with another 31 million rubles in grain loans.

　　苏联大力帮助匈保阿经济建设
    据新华社布达佩斯4日电　苏联给予匈牙利的巨大经济援助对匈牙利解放以来的经济恢复和发展，起了巨大的作用。
    苏联对匈牙利的经济援助首先是通过贸易来进行的。匈牙利解放后不久，在1945年8月，两国就签订了第一个贸易协定。从那时以来，两国先后签订了六个贸易协定，贸易额已经增加为匈牙利解放前的十九倍。
    今年3月间苏联同匈牙利签订的贸易协定更进一步给了匈牙利有力的援助。在基本建设方面，匈牙利解放以来在苏联帮助下建设了许多重要工业企业。匈牙利规模最大的冶金企业多瑙钢铁联合企业，就是由苏联帮助设计和装备、并在苏联专家指导下建设起来的。
    无偿赠与和贷款是苏联对匈牙利经济援助的另一个重要方面。最大量的贷款则是在匈牙利去年十月的反革命暴乱事件之后；匈牙利先后从各个社会主义国家获得共约十二亿卢布的贷款，其中有八亿七千五百万卢布是苏联贷给的。匈牙利在去年反革命事件中遭受严重损失以后，不但没有发生通货膨胀，而且在不到一年的时间内基本上恢复到去年的生产水平，这样迅速的恢复是同各兄弟国家的援助、首先是苏联所给予的巨大援助分不开的。
    目前，苏联正在帮助建造第一座原子反应堆和第一个原子能发电站。
    据新华社索非亚4日电　解放以来，保加利亚在社会主义建设方面得到了苏联的巨大援助。
    到去年年底为止，苏联提供保加利亚的长期贷款达八十亿列弗，约相当于这一时期保加利亚基本建设投资总额的27％。保加利亚用这些贷款从苏联购买了国民经济各部门所需要的机器、设备和建筑材料。
    苏联除了提供机器设备外，还通过供给技术资料设计蓝图、派遣专家等方式在各项建设中给保加利亚以技术援助。解放以来，仅在工业各部门就有一千一百多个苏联专家在保加利亚工作过。在农业方面，保加利亚在苏联帮助下建立了自己的农业机器和化学肥料工厂。保加利亚还不断地从苏联得到多种农业机器。到1960年，保加利亚就可以在主要工作方面完成农业的机械化。
    据新华社地拉那4日电　阿尔巴尼亚在解放后的十三年中经济发展十分迅速，苏联的援助在这方面起了很大作用。
    自从阿尔巴尼亚解放以来，苏联给予阿尔巴尼亚的贷款共达四亿二千万卢布。根据今年4月阿苏会谈的结果，苏联取消了这些债务，作为对阿尔巴尼亚的无偿赠与。通过这些贷款，苏联供应了阿尔巴尼亚许多厂矿、水电站的全套设备。
    在农业和畜牧业方面，由于苏联的帮助，阿尔巴尼亚建立了二十二个拖拉机站，苏联供应了大量的拖拉机、联合机等农业机器，以及改良土壤的全套设备。今年4月阿苏会谈后，苏联又给予阿尔巴尼亚三千一百万卢布的粮食贷款。
