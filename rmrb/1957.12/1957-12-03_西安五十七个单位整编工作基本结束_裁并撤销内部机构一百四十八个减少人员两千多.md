　　Basic Completion of Reorganization Work of Fifty-Seven Units in Xi'an
　  148 Internal Organizations Abolished and Merged, Reducing Staff by Over Two Thousand
    (Our Newspaper) After the masses aired their views freely, debated extensively on organizational structure and staffing, fifty-seven Party, government, and mass organizations in Xi'an City have determined their new staffing levels. According to the new staffing levels, 2,425 staff members can be reduced, accounting for 41.21% of the original staffing.

    The reorganization work of the first batch of fifty-seven units in Xi'an City that underwent reorganization started around the 20th of last month. Leading comrades of each unit made mobilization reports to the masses on streamlining organizations and transferring cadres to lower levels, requiring the broad masses of employees to freely air their views on the problems existing in the organizational structure and staffing of their units in the past. During this process, all comrades in each unit deeply exposed the long-standing problems of bloated organizations and overstaffing with a revolutionary spirit. At the same time, in the spirit of improving work, reducing administrative layers, and leveraging potential strength, they put forward opinions on new organizational structures and staffing.

    When debating the new organizational structure and determining the number of personnel, the comrades in each unit were able to conduct serious discussions and research using methods of presenting business, calculating detailed accounts, and explaining principles. In some units, the leaders had right-leaning conservative ideas, and the proposed streamlining plans were not practical. After discussion by the masses, they were criticized, and as a result, they had to revise the plans repeatedly. In other units, comrades simultaneously proposed several plans, and then repeatedly compared them among the masses, eliminated them one by one, and finally selected the one that best suited the actual situation and was beneficial to future work.

    After the masses extensively debated and determined the organizational structure and staffing, these fifty-seven units can abolish and merge a total of 148 municipal-level bureau/division level and equivalent internal organizations, accounting for 40.44% of the total number of original organizations at the same level. The original staffing was 5,889 people, and now according to the new staffing, only 3,464 people are needed, reducing the staff by 2,425 people. Because in the debate on reorganizing organizations, the broad masses of cadres have ideologically recognized the revolutionary significance of this streamlining and reduction of personnel, the vast majority of cadres have posted big-character posters, written application forms and letters of guarantee to the organization requesting to be transferred to lower levels. Now that the new organizations have been determined in each unit, they are actively studying the rational arrangement of cadres based on work needs and the specific conditions of each cadre.

　　西安五十七个单位整编工作基本结束
　  裁并撤销内部机构一百四十八个减少人员两千多
    本报讯　经过群众对机构设置、人员编制的一场大鸣大放，大争大辩之后，西安市党、政、群众团体已有五十七个单位确定了新编制。根据新编制可以减少工作人员两千四百二十五人，占原编制的41.21％。
    西安市第一批进行整编的五十七个单位的整编工作，都先后于上月20日左右开始。各单位领导同志都分别向群众作了紧缩机构、下放干部的动员报告，要求广大职工群众对本单位以往机构设置、人员编制方面存在的问题进行大鸣大放。在这个过程中，各单位所有的同志都以革命精神深入地揭发了本单位机构臃肿、人浮于事等长期存在的问题，同时也本着改进工作，减少办事层次，发挥潜在力量的精神，提出了新的机构设置和人员编制的意见。
    各单位在辩论新的机构设置和确定人员名额时，同志们都能用摆业务、算细账、讲道理的办法进行认真讨论研究。有的单位领导上由于有右倾保守思想，制定的紧缩机构方案不切合实际，经过群众讨论都受到了批判，因而不得不对方案一再进行修改。还有的单位同志们同时提出好多个方案，然后在群众中一个个进行反复评比，逐个淘汰，最后选择出最能切合实际对今后工作有利的其中的一个方案。
    经过群众大争大辩之后确定机构设置和人员编制的这五十七个单位，可以裁并撤销市级科处一级和相当这一级的内部机构共一百四十八个，占原有同一级机构总数的40.44％；原编制人员五千八百八十九人，现按新编制只需三千四百六十四人，减少人员两千四百二十五人。由于在整编机构的辩论中，广大干部已从思想上认识到这次紧缩机构、减少人员的革命意义，因而绝大多数干部纷纷张贴大字报，向组织写申请表和保证书要求下放，现在各单位在新机构确定后，正在根据工作需要和干部各人的具体条件，积极研究干部的合理安排问题。
