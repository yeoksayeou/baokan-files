The fiery water conservancy construction movement still has some cold corners. These dead corners should be eliminated quickly so that the movement develops more comprehensively and healthily. Before the spring plowing, the 1958 water conservancy construction tasks should be completed to lay a solid foundation for the overall leap forward in agricultural production!

This newspaper reports: A magnificent, large-scale mass movement for water conservancy construction has been launched in most parts of the country. However, in the fiery movement, there are still cold corners; in the surging high tide, there are still calm places. There are slow-moving areas in almost every province and every county, and they are particularly prominent in some provinces and counties. If this unsatisfactory situation is not changed, there is still a risk that the task of farmland water conservancy construction this winter and next spring will not be completed. The current task of leadership in water conservancy movement is: On the one hand, pay attention to guiding advanced areas to continue to move forward and strive to overfulfill their tasks; on the other hand, actively help and urge slow-moving areas to catch up quickly!

Comrade Chen Zhengren, Deputy Minister of the Rural Work Department of the CPC Central Committee and Deputy Director of the Seventh Office of the State Council, delivered a radio talk to rural workers and agricultural cooperative members across the country on the Central People's Broadcasting Station last night. The above-mentioned basic situation of the current water conservancy construction movement and the current tasks of the leadership were all pointed out in his talk.

36% of the 1958 Water Conservancy Construction Plan has been completed

He said: Judging from the current development of the water conservancy movement, its characteristics are: large scale, sufficient energy, and fast progress. According to incomplete statistics from 20 provinces and regions as of December 20, the number of people working on water conservancy construction every day has reached more than 63 million. For example, in Anhui Province, the average number of people working every day is more than 11 million, accounting for about 80% of the province's agricultural labor force. Henan, Shandong, Sichuan and other provinces also have 7 or 8 million laborers working. Many counties, districts, townships, and cooperatives that have developed well have invested in water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, and other agricultural basic construction. The number of people has reached more than 80%-90% of the total labor force, and even local urban residents, students, troops, and handicraftsmen have also participated in the booming water conservancy construction movement. In these areas, there are really no idlers in every household, and everyone is engaged in production. The members of the commune proposed "go to work early and leave work late, be a hero under the moonlight." They took the farmland as the battle line, the ponds and dams as the battlefield, and the hoe and carrying pole as the swords and guns, and were determined to eliminate drought and flood disasters earlier. In some areas in the north, although it has entered the cold season, the wind and snow cannot cool the people's fiery hearts. Many areas are rushing to work in the snow and insisting on completing their tasks. They put forward the heroic slogan of "strong winds cannot blow away the high tide, and cold weather cannot freeze the determination" and tenaciously fought against the severe cold and freezing. With the support of this enthusiastic emotion, water conservancy construction has achieved unprecedented results in the past two months. Many counties and cooperatives have completed their original winter repair tasks ahead of schedule, and some have even completed their 1958 water conservancy plan tasks ahead of schedule. Only 16 provinces, according to incomplete statistics as of December 20, the benefits of various engineering facilities that have been completed can expand the irrigated area by 33.9 million mu, accounting for more than 36% of the 1958 planned target of 92.21 million mu. For example, Henan Province expanded the irrigated area by 1.54 million mu in the past 20 days. By early December, 14 counties in Gansu Province had completed their original 1958 plan. By late November, Baoding Prefecture in Hebei Province had expanded the irrigated area by 1.32 million mu, accounting for 94% of the original annual plan. While carrying out water conservancy construction, flood control and soil and water conservation work have also made great progress in various places.

Some areas are slow to act and lack enthusiasm

According to the national target of increasing the irrigated area by 92.21 million mu in 1958 recently determined by the State Economic Commission, from the perspective of the national progress, from mid-October to early December, it took about two months, with an average of about 15 million mu completed per month. From now to the spring plowing next year, there are about three to four months left; more than 15 million mu must be completed every month to achieve the planned task of 92.21 million mu. At the same time, there are also tasks such as soil and water conservation, flood control, improvement of existing irrigation facilities, winter irrigation and spring irrigation, which also require a lot of labor and time. We must soberly consider that in these three or four months, in addition to water conservancy construction, leaders at all levels must also devote great efforts to rectify the commune and do a good job in accumulating fertilizer, winter plowing, land processing, sideline production, and so on. In northern areas, we must also withstand the impact of snow and freezing. The actual time that can be truly used for construction is only about 100 days. In order to ensure that rectification of the commune and production are not delayed, it is entirely possible for provinces such as Henan, Hebei, Anhui, and Gansu to seize the time, not slacken their efforts, and make full use of the winter time to complete and overfulfill their tasks. However, according to the recent reports from various provinces, not all provinces, counties, townships, and cooperatives are seizing the time so tightly and with such great enthusiasm. For example, in Heilongjiang Province, there are still five counties that have not taken any action at all. According to statistics from Zhejiang Province at the end of November, there are still 12 counties without water conservancy activities. The Hulunbuir League and Bayannur League in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region did not hold meetings to deploy water conservancy tasks until early December. Although 14 counties in Gansu Province have overfulfilled their tasks, some individual counties have not developed a single mu of irrigated land.

The main reason for the slowness is the ideological problems of the leadership

What are the reasons for the slow development of the water conservancy movement in some areas? Comrade Chen Zhengren said: According to the inspection results of Zhejiang, Shanxi, Hunan, Inner Mongolia and other provinces and regions, it can be roughly summarized into the following aspects: First of all, the leadership, especially the grass-roots leadership, does not have a sufficient understanding of the important relationship between water conservancy and agricultural production, the direction of water conservancy development is not well grasped, the movement is not tightly grasped, and the determination is not enough. Lack of enthusiasm is the main reason why work cannot be carried out quickly. Second, there is a lack of unified arrangement for winter agricultural production and labor use. Winter plowing, winter planting, land processing, fertilizer accumulation, sideline production, and water conservancy construction are mutually opposed, and it is believed that only after completing one task can another task be carried out. As a result, on the one hand, many tasks that should be able to be done at the same time have not been done, and on the other hand, a lot of labor has been wasted idle. Third, the policy of "small-scale as the mainstay, relying on the masses, and running water conservancy diligently and thriftily" has not been implemented enough. They do not pay attention to tapping the potential of the masses and the local areas, and simply wait for allocations and equipment from higher levels. Some areas have placed their main strength on a few larger-scale key projects, while neglecting the leadership of large-scale mass water conservancy projects. Fourth, it is limited to general appeals and lacks specific guidance. Or there is deployment but no inspection; there are indicators but no measures; or there is a lack of strong movement guidance institutions, and problems cannot be solved in time. These have seriously affected the healthy and smooth development of the movement.

For slow areas, we must inspect, help, supervise, and criticize

The important key to solving these problems at present lies in the leaders personally going to the slow areas to provide in-depth and specific assistance to solve ideological problems. Practice has proved that the first secretary of the Party committee taking command, leading cadres contracting and being responsible for sections, focusing on in-depth work, and conducting universal inspections are the primary links in breaking through backwardness and quickly carrying out work. Some areas, in response to the thinking of local cadres and the masses, put forward topics, organized debates, and found the reasons why water conservancy work could not be carried out, and solved ideological problems; or organized Party and government responsible comrades in areas with insufficient enthusiasm to visit advanced areas; or selected cadres from advanced areas to provide assistance to slow areas. These are all effective methods, and all localities can adopt them according to local conditions and people. For areas where work is particularly ineffective, the situation should be investigated and then publicly criticized in newspapers, and they should be required to examine in newspapers the reasons why they cannot move.

We must trust the masses and rely on the masses

Another important key to overcoming backwardness is to dispel the view in some areas that they simply wait for national assistance while neglecting to mobilize and rely on the masses. "Relying on the masses and vigorously developing farmland water conservancy" is a fundamental policy of farmland water conservancy construction in our country. Many people support and understand this in principle, but in specific implementation, some areas have not seriously implemented it. Some people often emphasize the special circumstances of their own area, saying that this can be done in high-yield areas, but it is difficult in barren areas; this can be done in plain areas, but it is difficult in mountainous areas; the masses elsewhere have the habit of raising funds and materials, but in this area, water conservancy has always been invested by the state, and it is difficult to change the method immediately... All these statements are wrong. Wushan County in Gansu Province is a poor mountainous area. This year, it has developed more than 110,000 mu of irrigated land, of which the subsidy given is only 17 cents per mu. Many vivid examples show that as long as we explain the truth to the masses, earnestly and deeply mobilize the masses, and adhere to the policy of adapting to local conditions, using local materials, and running water conservancy diligently and thriftily, the masses are willing to contribute money and effort. Relying on the masses and relying on cooperatives can not only solve the problems of funds and materials in farmland water conservancy construction, but also solve the problem of technical guidance. Over the years, the peasant masses have accumulated rich experience in fighting against water and drought disasters. At present, there are about 1 million peasant water conservancy technicians, well-drilling technicians, and water pump drivers who have received short-term training in the country. There are also many experienced masters in rural areas who have experience in well-drilling and dam-building. Giving full attention to the training and use of these people is the fundamental way to solve the problem of technical guidance in the current mass water conservancy. Various places can also take measures such as holding "old farmer forums," "skilled craftsman meetings," and "Zhuge Liang meetings" to rely on the wisdom of the masses to solve some of the difficulties encountered in the progress of the project.

Promote advanced experience and overcome blind optimism

The third key to overcoming backwardness is to widely promote various advanced experiences and take measures such as organizing visits, holding seminars, and using newspapers, radio, and compiling small booklets to disseminate advanced experiences in a timely manner and drive backwardness.

In areas where work is developing well and tasks are being completed a lot, we should also pay close attention to constantly preventing and overcoming blind optimism and strive to overfulfill tasks. According to the recent report from Sichuan Province, Kai County in Wanxian Prefecture of the province was the best place for water conservancy work in the entire prefecture last year, but this year it has fallen to seventh place. Suining County has also dropped from the first place in the prefecture to the eighth place. The main reason for their change from advanced to backward is that the leadership is satisfied with the existing achievements and the work is generalized. In areas like these, as long as the leadership quickly changes these shortcomings, they will soon catch up.

Pay attention to quality, safety, and overall arrangements

In the construction of projects in various places, we should pay close attention to project quality and construction safety, and truly achieve "repairing one place and using it well," "guaranteeing quality, guaranteeing quantity, and guaranteeing safety," that is, achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results. Only in this way can we improve the enthusiasm of the masses in water conservancy construction and create favorable conditions for continuing to carry out work. Recently, casualties have occurred continuously in some areas in water conservancy construction, and effective measures have not been taken to stop them. This situation should arouse the high vigilance of the local leading departments and be quickly improved. Close attention should also be paid to the work of keeping warm and protecting against the cold on the construction site.

For the use of rural labor in winter, it is hoped that Party committees and agricultural cooperatives at all levels should make plans and arrange them appropriately. In particular, we should attach importance to giving play to the role of women and semi-laborers, so as to ensure that winter production and sideline production are not delayed, and more labor can be drawn into water conservancy and other agricultural basic construction. We should also attach importance to the rational use of labor, maximize labor efficiency, and avoid phenomena such as rushing to work.

A great opportunity, don't lose it!

Comrade Chen Zhengren pointed out: Winter is a great season for water conservancy construction in most parts of our country, and the opportunity cannot be lost. Recently, the leading departments of Hunan, Shandong, Jiangsu and other provinces held telephone conferences or broadcast rallies, calling on cadres and farmers across the province to seize the time in December and January and February, make persistent efforts, and push the water conservancy movement to a new climax. This measure is completely correct and timely. This should be done in most areas of the country that are not severely affected by freezing. We suggest that all provinces, prefectures, counties, and agricultural cooperatives that have climatic conditions should strive to complete or basically complete the water conservancy construction tasks for the entire year of 1958 before the spring plowing. If this requirement can be achieved, it will lay a solid and reliable foundation for the great leap forward in agricultural production in 1958. As long as we work harder, make the backward areas catch up, and make the advanced areas maintain the high tide, we believe that it is entirely possible to achieve this requirement. It is hoped that governments and agricultural cooperatives at all levels can use this requirement as the goal of struggle for winter water conservancy work, make overall arrangements, and strive to achieve it all. In the northeast, northwest, and parts of north China where the winter is severely cold, we should take advantage of the time before the heavy freezing to try to do more projects. As long as the leadership is determined, does a good job in the political work of the masses, and takes some appropriate measures, it is still possible to continue construction in some areas even in areas that have already frozen. Yanbei Prefecture in Shanxi Province has adopted the method of "freezing in the morning and evening and working at noon, freezing on the shady slopes and working on the sunny slopes," and there are still 200,000 people engaged in farmland basic construction every day. Projects such as storing water to raise ice, building ice dams, drilling wells, and some projects that can be carried out in sheds should be actively built.

    先进的再前进！  迟缓的赶上去！
    在火热的水利建设运动中，还有一些冷冷清清的角落。应当迅速地消灭这些死角，使运动更全面更健康地发展，在春耕前完成1958年度水利建设任务，为农业生产全面大跃进打下坚实的基础！
    本报讯  一个规模壮阔、声势浩大的群众性的兴修水利运动已在全国大部地区展开。但是，在火热的运动里，还有冷冷清清的角落；在澎湃的高潮中，还有风平浪静的地方。行动迟缓的地区，几乎每个省每个县都有，在部分省和县特别突出。这种不能令人满意的情况如果不加改变，今冬明春兴修农田水利的任务仍有不能完成的危险。当前领导方面在水利运动方面的任务是：一方面，注意指导先进地区继续前进，争取超额完成任务；另一方面，积极帮助和督促行动迟缓的地区，迅速地赶上去！
    中共中央农村工作部副部长、国务院第七办公室副主任陈正人同志昨天晚上在中央人民广播电台对全国各地农村工作人员和农业社社员发表了广播谈话。上述当前水利建设运动的基本情况和当前领导方面的任务，都是他在这次谈话中指出的。
    1958年度水利建设计划已经完成了36％
    他说：从当前水利运动发展的情况看，其特点是：规模大、劲头足、进度快。根据二十个省区到12月20日的不完全统计，当前每天出工兴修水利的人数，达到六千三百万人以上。例如安徽省每天平均出工人数达一千一百余万人，占全省农业劳动力的80％左右。河南、山东、四川等省出工的劳动力也有七、八百万人之多。许多开展较好的县、区、乡、社，投入兴修水利，积肥和其他农业基本建设的人数达到总劳动力的80％—90％以上，甚至连当地的城镇居民、学生、驻军、手工业者也都参加了轰轰烈烈的兴修水利运动。在这些地区，真是户户无闲人，人人搞生产；社员们提出“早出工、晚收工，月亮底下当英雄”。他们把田土作战线，塘坝当战场，锄头扁担当刀枪，决心要把旱涝灾害更早消灭。北方部分地区，虽然已经进入严寒季节，但风雪吹不冷人们火热的心，很多地区冒雪赶工，坚持完成任务。他们提出“大风吹不走高潮，天冷冻不了决心”的英雄口号，顽强与严寒冰冻作斗争。在这种热烈情绪的支持下，两个多月来，水利建设获得了空前成绩，不少县、社已经提前完成了原订的冬修任务，有的甚至已提前完成了1958年的水利计划任务。光是十六个省，截止12月20日的不完全统计，已经完成的各项工程设施的效益，就可以扩大灌溉面积三千三百九十万亩，占1958年度计划指标九千二百二十一万亩的36％以上。如河南省在最近二十天中，就扩大了灌溉面积一百五十四万亩；甘肃省到12月上旬已经有十四个县完成了1958年的原订计划；河北省保定专区到11月下旬，已扩大灌溉面积一百三十二万亩，占原订年度计划的94％。在兴修水利的同时，各地治涝和水土保持工作也有很大进展。
    部分地区行动迟缓，劲头不大
    根据国家经济委员会最近确定的1958年全国增加灌溉面积的指标是九千二百二十一万亩。从全国进度来看，由10月中旬到12月上旬，约两个月的时间，平均每月完成一千五百万亩左右。从现在到明年春耕，约还有三个月到四个月的时间；必须每月完成一千五百万亩以上才能实现九千二百二十一万亩的计划任务。同时还有水土保持、治涝、改善已有灌溉设施、冬灌春灌等项工作，也需要很多的劳动力和时间。我们要清醒地考虑到，在这三、四个月的时间中，除了兴修水利外，各级领导还要拿出很大力量来进行整社工作以及搞好积肥、冬耕、土地加工、副业生产等等。北方地区还要经受下雪、冰冻的影响，实际能够真正用于施工的时间，也不过一百天左右。为了做到整社、生产两不误，像河南、河北、安徽、甘肃等省，抓的紧，不松劲，充分利用冬季时间，完成和超额完成任务是完全可能的。但是，根据最近各省汇报的情况来看，并不是所有的省、县、乡、社都是那样抓的紧，那样劲头大。如黑龙江省到现在为止还有五个县根本没有行动起来；浙江省到11月底的统计还有十二个县没有水利活动；内蒙古自治区的呼伦贝尔盟和巴彦淖尔盟到12月上旬才开会向下布置水利任务；甘肃省虽然有十四个县已超额完成了任务，但也有个别县份却一亩水地也没有发展。
    迟缓的主要原因是领导思想有毛病
    当前部分地区水利运动开展迟缓的原因，究竟何在呢？陈正人同志说：根据浙江、山西、湖南、内蒙古等省区检查结果，大致可归纳为以下几个方面：首先是领导思想上，特别是基层领导的思想上，对水利和农业生产的重大关系认识不足，对发展水利方向掌握不定，对运动抓的不紧，决心不够，劲头不足，这是工作不能迅速开展的主要原因。第二，对冬季农业生产和劳力的使用缺乏统一安排，把冬耕、冬种、土地加工、积肥、副业生产和兴修水利等工作，互相对立起来，认为只能做完一项工作，才能再干另一项工作。因而一方面使许多应该能够同时作而又可以作的工作没有作起来，而另一方面却有不少劳动力在空闲浪费。第三，对“小型为主，依靠群众，勤俭办水利”的方针贯彻不够，不注意发掘群众的和本地区的潜力，单纯等待上级拨款、拨器材。有些地区把主要力量放在少数较大型的重点工程上，而忽视了大面积的群众性水利工程的领导。第四，只限于一般号召，缺乏具体指导。或是有布置，无检查；有指标，无措施；或是缺乏强有力的运动指导机构，有问题不能及时解决。这些都严重影响着运动健康地顺利地发展。
    对迟缓的地区要检查、帮助、督促、批评
    当前解决这些问题的重要关键，在于领导亲自出马，到迟缓的地区，深入地具体地进行帮助，解决思想问题。实践证明，党委第一书记挂帅，领导干部分片包干负责，重点深入，普遍检查，是当前突破落后、迅速开展工作的首要环节。有些地区，针对当地干部、群众的思想，出题目，组织辩论，找水利工作不能开展的原因，解决了思想问题；或者组织劲头不足地区的党政负责同志到先进地区参观；或由先进地区挑选干部，到迟缓的地区进行帮助。这些都是行之有效的办法，各地都可以因地制宜、因人制宜地采用。对于工作特别不力的地区，应当查明情况后在报纸上公开批评，并要求他们在报纸上检查动不起来的原因。
    必须相信群众、依靠群众
    克服落后的另一个重要关键，是解除部分地区单纯等待国家帮助，而忽视发动和依靠群众的观点。“依靠群众，大兴农田水利”是我国农田水利建设的一项根本方针。在道理上很多人都拥护的，都明白的，但在具体执行中，有些地区却没有认真贯彻，有些人往往强调本地区的特殊情况，说什么丰产的地区可以这样做，贫瘠的地区就有困难；平原地区可以这样做，山区就有困难；别处群众有集资筹料的习惯可以这样做，本地区一贯是由国家投资办水利，马上改变方式就有困难，……这种种说法，都是不对的。甘肃省武山县是个贫苦山区，今年一年发展了十一万多亩水地，其中给补助的每亩也不过一角七分钱。很多生动的事例说明，只要向群众讲清道理，认真深入地发动群众，坚持因地制宜、就地取材、勤俭办水利的方针，群众是愿意出钱出力的。依靠群众，依靠合作社不但能解决农田水利建设中的资金和物料问题，就是技术指导问题，也可以得到解决。农民群众多年来在与水旱灾害作斗争中，积累了丰富的经验。现在全国约有一百多万受过短期训练的农民水利技术员、凿井技工、抽水机司机手，在农村中还有更多的有打井筑坝经验的老师傅，充分重视对这些人的培养使用，是解决当前群众性水利中技术指导问题的根本办法。各地还可以采取开“老农座谈会”、“精工巧匠会”“诸葛亮会”等办法，依靠群众智慧来解决工程进行中碰到的一些困难。
    推广先进经验克服盲目乐观情绪
    克服落后的第三个关键，是广泛推广各种先进经验，采取组织参观，开座谈会，利用报纸、广播、编小册子等方式，及时传播先进经验，带动落后。
    在工作开展较好，任务完成较多的地区，也应切实注意，不断预防和克服盲目乐观情绪，力争超额完成任务。根据最近四川省汇报，该省万县专区的开县，去年是全专区水利工作开展最好的一个地方，而今年却落到了第七名；遂宁县也是由本专区的第一名降为第八名。他们从先进变为落后的主要原因，就是领导上满足于已有的成绩，工作一般化。像这些地区，只要领导迅速改变这些缺点，很快就会赶上去的。
    注意质量，注意安全，注意全面安排
    各地在兴修工程中，应当十分注意工程质量和施工安全，切实做到修好一处，用好一处，“保质、保量、保安全”，就是说要做到多快好省。只有这样才能提高群众兴修水利的积极情绪，造成继续开展工作的有利条件。最近，部分地区在兴修水利中，不断发生伤亡事故，而没有采取有效措施加以制止，这种情况，应当引起当地领导部门的高度警惕，迅速改善。对于工地御寒保温工作也要密切注意。
    对于冬季农村劳动力的使用，希望各级党委和农业合作社都应当作出计划。适当安排。特别要重视发挥妇女和半劳动力的作用，以便一面不误冬季生产和副业生产，一面能抽出更多的劳动力投入水利和其他农业基本建设。还要重视合理使用劳力，最大限度地提高劳动效率，避免干活一窝蜂等现象。
    大好时机，切勿失去！
    陈正人同志指出：冬季是我国绝大部分地区兴修水利的大好季节，时机不可失去。最近湖南、山东、江苏等省领导部门召开了电话会议或广播大会，号召全省干部和农民群众，抓紧12月和1、2月的时间，再接再厉，把水利运动推向新的高潮，这种措施是完全正确和及时的。在全国不受冰冻严重影响的大部分地区，都应当这样作。我们建议：凡是气候条件允许的省、专、县和农业合作社都应当争取在春耕以前完成或基本完成1958年全年水利兴修任务，这个要求若能实现，将为1958年农业生产的大跃进，奠定坚实可靠的基础。只要我们再加一把劲，使落后地区赶上去，先进地区把高潮坚持下去，相信是完全有可能达到这个要求的。希望各级政府和农业社，能把这个要求作为冬季水利工作的奋斗目标，全面安排，力争全部实现。东北、西北和华北部分冬季严寒的地区，更应趁目前未上大冻以前，争取多作一些工程。只要领导有决心，做好群众政治工作，并采取一些适当的措施，就是在已经冰冻的地区，还是可以部分继续施工的。山西雁北专区采取“早晚结冻中午干、阴坡结冻阳坡干”的办法，每天还有二十万人进行农田基本建设。像蓄水养冰、打冰坝、打井以及一些可以在工棚中进行的工程，更应积极兴建。
