　　In this enterprise rectification campaign, many opinions of the workers on the work of the enterprise were raised within the trade union groups; the debates on some issues were also conducted within the trade union groups, or first started within the trade union groups and then expanded. Some enterprises also submitted the handling methods and rectification plans for the opinions raised by the workers to the trade union groups for discussion. Trade union group meetings played a significant role in the rectification campaign, becoming one of the good forms for promoting socialist democracy.

　　In fact, trade union groups have long been playing their role in enterprise life. Everyone knows the position of trade union groups in enterprises. They are generally established according to production teams (sections, work teams), and production teams are the most basic units of enterprise production. Trade union groups face every individual and work directly with them, and most of the work of the trade union is specifically realized through them. Trade union groups determine the effectiveness of trade union grassroots work and also greatly affect the production of enterprises.

　　In recent years, with the development of trade union grassroots work, trade union group work has also seen new development, and groups that have done well in their work have continued to emerge in various regions and industries. These trade union groups have accumulated some experience in their work. Their experience points out that the effectiveness of trade union group activities should be concentrated on doing a good job in production. To do a good job in production, it is necessary to carry out mass production organization work; at the same time, doing a good job in production is the result of carrying out work in many aspects, especially the result of doing a good job in the ideological and political work of the group. Trade union group leaders should pay attention to discovering key issues in production and also help production team leaders take technical or organizational measures to solve problems. However, trade union group leaders should find out the problems existing in the workers themselves more through the problems in production. Some people encounter difficulties in production technology, some people encounter difficulties in their personal lives, and some people have problems in their ideological understanding. These problems need to be solved by using collective strength according to different situations. If some people do not abide by labor discipline or have other serious ideological and work style problems, the trade union group leader should organize everyone to reason with him and conduct necessary criticism of him. By solving these problems, we can stimulate the enthusiasm of the workers, and organize this enthusiasm through the formulation of guarantee conditions, carry out competitions, and guide everyone to work hard to improve and increase production.

　　Their experience points out that the group, as a collective, must continuously enhance unity. Within the trade union group, some contradictions occur daily. The production command work undertaken by the production team leader is specific and complicated. He has a direct relationship with each worker. In terms of assigning work, adjusting labor organization, determining quotas, supervising product quality, maintaining labor discipline, promoting grades, and distributing bonuses, workers often have opinions. If some production team leaders lack a democratic work style, have simple and rigid work methods, or some workers lack a correct work attitude, contradictions are more likely to occur. The workers in the group have their own ideas and personalities. Sometimes there are also some opinions between each other in production cooperation, evaluation and rewards, and life together. Some of these problems need to be solved by the superiors, but most of them can be solved within the group. The trade union group, on the one hand, creates conditions for the production team leader to follow the mass line. The production team leader can report the tasks of the group to the workers through group production meetings, group life meetings, or other forms, raise problems in the work, listen to everyone's criticisms and suggestions, and absorb everyone to improve production work together; on the other hand, carry out criticism and self-criticism among the workers, help the workers establish a correct work attitude, and resolve the contradictions between each other.

　　Their experience points out that the trade union group is both a regular place for promoting internal democracy in enterprises and for conducting mass self-education; it constantly concentrates and persists. Since the establishment of the workers' congress and the development of the rectification campaign, the role of the trade union group in this regard has become more significant. Workers' representatives are generally produced from trade union groups. They collect proposals within the group, listen to the masses' criticisms and suggestions on the work of the enterprise, and solicit the masses' opinions on the solution of various problems, and then bring them to the workers' congress for study. The resolutions and calls passed by the workers' congress are conveyed to all members of the group by the workers' representatives, and the trade union group studies how to specifically implement them. At the same time, the group's criticisms and suggestions and how to implement the resolutions of the congress are often repeatedly deliberated, discussed, and debated. This often involves the workers' understanding and attitude towards the relationship between improving life and developing production, personal interests and national interests, democracy and centralization, freedom and discipline. Through deliberation, discussion, and debate, incorrect understandings are overcome, correct viewpoints are established, and everyone's awareness is raised.

　　Similarly, the trade union group is a regular place for fully promoting trade union democracy and implementing trade union resolutions. The active life of the trade union group strengthens the trade union members' sense of responsibility towards the trade union organization and close the link between the trade union organization and the entire working masses.

　　The activity methods of these groups are roughly: 1. Group meetings. There are basically two types of group meetings, namely group meetings (commonly known as group life meetings) and group production meetings. 2. Collective activities, such as reading newspapers, listening to reports, visiting, and going to parks. 3. Individual activities, such as visiting each other, individual heart-to-heart talks, and comforting the sick.

　　Trade union group meetings are one of the main forms of trade union group activities. How to hold a good group meeting? According to the experience provided by groups that have done well in their work, attention should be paid to holding a good group meeting: 1. Determine the content of the meeting. In addition to the content uniformly arranged by the grassroots committee and the workshop committee, the group should choose the main problems currently existing in itself as the content of the meeting. The content should not be too much, and it should be of concern to everyone. In order to make everyone actively participate in the meeting, the content should be notified to everyone in advance, and some necessary deliberation should be done. 2. Control the meeting well. Fully promote democracy and pay attention to encouraging everyone to speak. For problems that are unclear about right and wrong, guide everyone to start a debate to clarify right and wrong. For problems that are not easy to discuss clearly for a while, be good at waiting, further organize investigation and research, or conduct individual deliberation, and then seek a solution. Unless there are special reasons, the meeting time should be shortened as much as possible, and it should be ended on time or ahead of schedule. 3. On the basis of conducting education, everyone voluntarily puts forward a covenant to be jointly observed, such as not being absent without reason, arriving on time, etc. The group backbone should take the lead in observing this covenant. 4. The grassroots and workshop committees should ensure the group meeting time in arranging spare time activities, and also help some workers solve the difficulties encountered due to participating in the meeting, such as extending the childcare time of kindergartens, etc.

　　The experience of these groups shows that doing a good job in the group requires giving play to the enthusiasm of each member of the group. The group leader has a great role in organizing everyone to do a good job in the group. The trade union group leader should be a person who is enthusiastic about serving everyone, he must be good at caring for others, and he should be a person who can play a leading role and set an example in production and social activities. The trade union group leader should form the backbone of the group together with the administrative group leader, the group cadre, the party member, and the old worker, jointly plan and carry out group activities, deliberate preliminary opinions on solving various problems, and rely on the group backbone to respectively undertake certain specific tasks in the group. The trade union group leader should support the production group leader, and the production group leader should rely on the trade union group leader, which is very important for doing a good job in the group.

　　Doing a good job in the group certainly depends on the efforts of all members of the group, but the key lies in strengthening the leadership of the grassroots committee and the workshop committee over the trade union group. According to the experience of some grassroots, the grassroots committee should let the trade union group solve the problems that they can solve, submit the problems that should be discussed by the masses to the trade union group for discussion, and at the same time create conditions for the trade union group to solve these problems. The trade union grassroots committee and the workshop committee should regularly study work together with the trade union group leaders. In addition to putting forward the necessary unified requirements, they should help the group leaders consider how to carry out activities according to the needs of each group. When carrying out a political movement or a major activity, the group leader should be informed of the task, working methods, and problems that should be paid attention to in the work in advance. It is best if there are groups that take the lead to introduce their practices. In order to specifically help the group leaders, the workshop committee members or even the grassroots committee members should also be assigned to contact certain groups, and they should help the group leaders consider the current tasks and study working methods together with the group leaders. When a task has progressed to a certain extent, the grassroots or workshop will convene a meeting of group leaders to check the work and exchange experiences. Some grassroots regularly analyze the work of the trade union group, classify and rank them, find out the experience of outstanding groups and the problems that still exist, and help them improve; find out the problems and difficulties in the work of backward groups, and help them learn from the experience of advanced groups and overcome difficulties. The grassroots committee should also help the group leaders systematically improve their leadership level, which is mainly done through short-term amateur training. The training of trade union group leaders is best conducted twice a year: once after the trade union re-election, to explain to the group leaders the tasks of the trade union, the responsibilities of the group, and how to be a trade union group leader; once half a year later, to solve the problems existing in the actual work of the group leaders and exchange group work experience.

　　An important experience for the grassroots committee to strengthen group work is to continuously educate workers to enhance collectivist ideology, and encourage workers to do a good job in the group from the competition reward methods and the selection of outstanding trade union activists. Their slogan is: everyone cares about the group, and every group strives for advancement.

　　Of course, the provincial and municipal trade unions and industrial trade unions analyze and study the group work in their respective regions and industries, make specific instructions on how trade union grassroots organizations strengthen group work, and pay attention to summarizing and exchanging group work experience and commending and rewarding outstanding trade union group leaders, which is of great help to strengthening trade union group work.

　　It should be said that although group work has made great progress, it is still a fact that group work is weak in many grassroots. In these grassroots, much work is concentrated at the grassroots committee level, the work of each workshop and each group is not very active, the role of trade union activists is difficult to give full play to, trade union members weaken their sense of responsibility towards the trade union because they have few opportunities to participate in trade union life, and the problems within the workshop group are difficult to be solved realistically and in a timely manner. Trade union full-time cadres work very hard but still cannot handle things completely. This situation should be changed.

　　怎样做好工会小组工作
    刘实代表（全总组织部部长）发言摘要
    在这次企业整风中，职工对企业工作的很多意见，是在工会小组内提出的；一些问题的辩论，也是在工会小组内进行或者首先在工会小组内展开而后扩大范围的。有一些企业，还把职工所提意见的处理办法和整改方案交到工会小组讨论。工会小组会，在整风中起了显著的作用，成为发扬社会主义民主的好形式之一。
    其实，工会小组在企业生活中早就发挥着自己的作用。工会小组在企业中所处的位置是大家都知道的。它一般的是按照生产组（工段、工作队）建立的，生产组是企业生产的最基本的单位。工会小组面对着每一个人并且直接对他们进行工作，工会的绝大部分工作是通过它来具体实现的。工会小组决定着工会基层工作的成效，也在很大程度上影响着企业的生产。
    这几年，随着工会基层工作的发展，工会小组工作也有了新的发展，工作做得好的小组在各地、各产业都不断地出现。这些工会小组在工作中都积累了一些经验。他们的经验指出：工会小组活动的成效要集中地表现在搞好生产上。要搞好生产，必须进行群众生产组织工作；同时，搞好生产又是多方面进行工作的结果，特别是做好小组思想政治工作的结果。工会小组长要注意发现生产上的关键问题，也要帮助生产组长采取技术上或者组织上的措施来解决问题。但是，工会小组长要更多地透过生产上的问题找出职工本身存在的问题。有的人在生产技术上碰到困难，有的人在个人生活上碰到困难，有的人在思想认识上有问题，这些问题都需要分别情况来运用集体力量帮助解决。有的人不遵守劳动纪律或者有其他严重的思想作风问题，工会小组长就要组织大家同他讲道理，对他开展必要的批评。经过解决这些问题来激发职工的积极性，并且把这种积极性通过制订保证条件组织起来，开展竞赛，引导大家努力改进和提高生产。
    他们的经验指出：小组做为一个集体，必须不断地增强团结。在工会小组内，日常地发生着一些矛盾。生产组长所担负的生产指挥工作是具体而且繁杂的，他同每个职工直接发生关系，在派活、调整劳动组织、确定定额、监督产品质量、维护劳动纪律、提升等级和分配奖金等等方面，往往有的职工有意见。如果有的生产组长缺乏民主作风，工作方式简单生硬，或者有的职工缺乏正确的劳动态度，矛盾就更加容易发生。小组内的职工，各人有各人的思想性格，在生产协作、评比奖励和生活相处上，有时相互之间也有一些意见。这些问题，有的是需要上面来解决的，但是绝大部分是可以在小组内部解决的。工会小组，一方面给生产组长走群众路线创造条件，生产组长可以通过小组生产会议、小组生活会或其他形式向职工报告小组的任务，提出工作中的问题，听取大家的批评和建议，吸收大家一道来改进生产工作；一方面，在职工中开展批评和自我批评，帮助职工树立正确的劳动态度，解决相互之间的矛盾。
    他们的经验指出：工会小组既是发扬企业内部民主，又是进行群众自我教育的经常场所；它不断地集中起来，又坚持下去。在建立职工代表大会和开展整风以来，工会小组在这方面的作用更为显著。职工代表一般的是从工会小组中产生的，他在小组内搜集提案，听取群众对企业工作的批评和建议，征集群众对各项问题的解决意见，然后带到职工代表大会上去研究。职工代表大会所通过的决议和号召，由职工代表传达给小组全体成员，工会小组又研究如何具体贯彻执行。同时，小组对提出的批评建议和如何贯彻执行大会决议，又往往是经过反复的酝酿、讨论、争辩的，这里往往涉及到职工对改善生活和发展生产、个人利益和国家利益、民主和集中、自由和纪律等关系的认识和态度，经过酝酿、讨论、争辩，克服不正确的认识，树立正确的观点，提高了大家的觉悟。
    同样，工会小组是充分发扬工会民主、贯彻执行工会决议的经常场所。工会小组生活活跃，就增强了工会会员对工会组织的责任感，密切了工会组织同全体职工群众的联系。
    这些小组的活动方式，大致上是：1、小组会议。小组会议基本上有两种，就是小组会（通称小组生活会）和小组生产会议。2、集体活动，如读报、听报告、参观、游园等。3、个别活动，如互相串门、个别谈心、慰问病人等。
    工会小组会是工会小组活动的主要形式之一。如何开好小组会呢？根据工作得好的小组所提供的经验看，开好小组会要注意：1、确定好会议内容。除了基层委员会和车间委员会统一布置的内容外，小组要选择本身当前存在的主要问题做为会议内容。内容不能太多，而且应该是大家所关心的。为了使大家积极地参加会议，事先要把内容通知给大家，并且做一些必要的酝酿。2、掌握好会议。要充分发扬民主，注意启发大家发言。对于是非不清的问题，要引导大家展开辩论，弄清是非。对于一时不易谈清楚的问题，要善于等待，进一步组织调查研究，或者进行个别酝酿，再来求得解决。如无特殊原因，会议时间要尽量缩短，做到准时或者提前结束。3、在进行教育的基础上，由大家自愿提出共同遵守的公约，如不无故缺席、准时到会等等。小组骨干应该带头遵守这个公约。4、基层、车间委员会在安排业余活动时间上要保证小组会时间，还要帮助某些职工解决由于参加会议所碰到的困难，如延长托儿所的托儿时间等。
    这些小组的经验说明：搞好小组，需要发挥小组每个成员的积极性。在组织大家搞好小组上，小组长有着很大的作用。工会小组长应该是一个热心为大家服务的人，他要善于关心别人，他应该是个在生产上、社会活动上能够处处起带头作用和以身作则的人。工会小组长要和行政组长、小组干事、党员、老工人在一起形成小组的骨干，共同来筹划开展小组活动，酝酿解决各项问题的初步意见，并且依靠小组骨干来分别担负小组内的一定的具体任务。工会组长要支持生产组长，生产组长要依靠工会组长，这对于搞好小组是很重要的。
    搞好小组，固然要依靠小组全体成员的努力，但是关键还在于基层委员会和车间委员会加强对工会小组的领导。根据一些基层的经验看，基层委员会要放手地让工会小组解决它们能够解决的问题，把应该经过群众讨论的问题交到工会小组去讨论，同时给工会小组解决这些问题创造条件。工会基层委员会和车间委员会要定期地同工会小组长在一起研究工作，除了提出必要的统一的要求外，要帮助小组长考虑如何根据各小组的需要开展活动。在开展政治运动或者进行某项重大活动时，要事先向小组长交代任务、工作方法和工作中应注意的问题，最好能够有先行一步的小组介绍他们的做法。为了具体地帮助小组长，车间委员甚至基层委员还要分工联系一定的小组，他们帮助小组长考虑当前的任务，同小组长一道研究工作方法。当一项工作进行到一定程度时，基层或车间就召集小组长会议，检查工作，交流经验。有些基层对工会小组工作定期地进行分析，分类排队，找出优秀小组的经验和还存在的问题，帮助他们提高；找出落后小组工作中的问题和困难，帮助他们学习先进组的经验和克服困难。基层委员会还要帮助小组长有系统地提高领导水平，这主要是通过业余短期训练来进行。对工会小组长的训练最好一年能进行两次：一次在工会改选之后，向小组长讲清工会的任务、小组的职责、怎样当工会小组长；一次在半年以后，解决小组长在实际工作中存在的问题，交流小组工作经验。
    基层委员会加强小组工作的一条重要的经验是，要不断地教育职工增强集体主义思想，并且从竞赛奖励办法上和评选优秀工会积极分子上鼓励职工来搞好小组。他们的口号是：人人关心小组，组组争取先进。
    当然，省、市工会和产业工会对本地、本产业的小组工作进行分析研究，对工会基层组织如何加强小组工作做出具体指示，并且注意总结和交流小组工作经验、表扬奖励优秀工会小组长，对于加强工会小组工作是有很大作用的。
    应该说，虽然小组工作有很大发展，但是在不少基层里，小组工作薄弱还是一个事实。在这些基层里，许多工作都集中在基层委员会一级，各车间、各小组的工作很不活跃，工会积极分子的作用很难充分发挥，工会会员由于参加工会生活的机会很少而削弱了对工会的责任感，车间小组内部的问题很难切合实际地及时地得到解决，工会专职干部很辛苦却仍然不能把事情完全办好。这种情况是应当改变的。
