Promote Revolutionary Spirit by Streamlining Institutions, Participate in Labor, Able to Advance or Retreat
150,000 Transferred Cadres in Jiangsu to Take Up Production Posts

(Our report) Nanjing - After entering the third stage of rectification, focusing on rectification, the Party and government organs of Jiangsu Province and Nanjing City, the first batch of factories and mines and most universities in the province to carry out airing opinions and rectification, first focused on streamlining institutions and transferring cadres to strengthen the labor front. They treated this work with a revolutionary spirit that broke with convention, thus promoting a rapid upsurge of cadres participating in labor throughout the province. According to statistics, from mid-October to the end of November, the above-mentioned areas transferred more than 11,000 cadres, and nearly 70,000 cadres have been transferred in the past six months of consolidation, of which more than 37,000 have been directly transferred to participate in labor. The province originally planned to transfer 130,000 people. Judging from the current situation, it is estimated that it may reach 150,000.

At the end of last year, the progress of streamlining institutions and transferring cadres in Jiangsu Province was relatively slow. The reason was that although the leading organs had long recognized the phenomenon of bloated and oversized institutions and overstaffing, they did not have a deep understanding of the central government's instructions at that time. Therefore, they lacked revolutionary spirit and measures that broke with convention in arranging the placement of institutions and extra-establishment personnel. After this extensive airing of opinions, especially after studying the documents of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, everyone's understanding of streamlining institutions has been greatly improved. At the same time, the previous stage of consolidation work has basically clarified the situation of institutions and personnel. This enabled the leading organs to deeply realize the urgency and importance of conducting labor training for cadres, and they believed that the time was ripe for transferring a large number of cadres. Therefore, the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to transfer cadres according to the proportion of 35% to 50% for provincial and municipal-level organs, 40% for prefectural committees and special district organs, 15% to 20% for counties, and 50% for enterprises and institutions, regardless of the establishment of institutions and personnel. In this way, this work did not remain in the discussion of issues such as establishment and system, but quickly ushered in a leap forward and formed a upsurge of cadres participating in labor.

According to the experience of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, in order to make this work proceed quickly and well, in addition to first unifying the understanding of leading cadres and making a firm determination, it is also necessary to have loud revolutionary slogans and carry out large-scale political mobilization. The Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee first conveyed and studied the spirit of the Third Plenary Session to all cadres, and put forward loud mobilization slogans such as "Participate in the labor front to accelerate the realization of China's technological and cultural revolution from poverty to wealth," "Go to the countryside and up the mountains to realize the Forty Articles," and "Train ourselves into successors to the communist cause in labor." This changed people's resistant emotions caused by regarding the transferred cadres as "being streamlined," and enabled everyone to fully realize the great significance of participating in labor for national construction and self-transformation, and made the Party's intentions quickly become the urgent requirements of the vast number of cadres themselves, who regarded participating in labor as a heroic and glorious act. At the same time, discussions and debates were launched on some representative erroneous views such as "no future in the countryside" and "waste of talent," focusing on criticizing the bourgeoisie's view of despising labor, and criticizing the individual's gains and losses thinking of being able to advance but not retreat, being able to be an official but not a commoner. In this way, the issue of participating in labor training has become a matter of each cadre heroically participating in socialist construction with a high degree of self-sacrifice, and at the same time, it is also a matter of passing the socialist "hurdle," and it is a matter of struggle between two ideologies and two paths. Such extensive and in-depth ideological mobilization is not only necessary for all cadres, but also plays a role in changing customs and habits in society.

This time, Jiangsu Province adopted the method of in-depth mobilization from top to bottom, self-application and registration from bottom to top, and final approval by the leadership, adopted the method of advanced driving the backward, the masses educating themselves, and adopted methods such as letters of determination (posted in the form of big-character posters), honor rolls, farewell parties, and family forums, thus quickly forming a vigorous mass movement and quickly bringing the movement to a climax. This kind of mass conscious movement makes the leadership completely active, and there is no issue of establishment at all. Moreover, this time, from the heads of departments and bureaus to the secretaries of the provincial party committee, they all personally and enthusiastically talked to the transferred cadres, encouraged them to march into the countryside, train and transform themselves, carefully helped them solve ideological problems, and also seriously helped them solve certain necessary and solvable practical difficulties.

This kind of bold approach must be supplemented by comprehensive planning and meticulous organizational work. First of all, provincial-level organs and relevant units comprehensively rank all institutions and personnel to have a clear understanding. At the same time, unified consideration was given to the transfer of cadres and the retention of the backbone of the organs, the political quality and professional level of the cadres, resolutely implementing the Party's cadre line, and opposing the tendency to only value the professional level of cadres and ignore political quality. Treat female cadres and male cadres equally to prevent squeezing out female cadres. Unified consideration was also given to some aspects, such as the need to increase a group of backbones on the cultural and educational front and at the grassroots level in the countryside, and the need to supplement vacancies after the cleaning up of primary and secondary school teachers. In terms of the order of transfer, first transfer those who directly participate in labor production, and then transfer others. Those who live in the countryside and have their own labor force generally return to their hometowns to participate in labor; those who have labor force but live in cities or have no home are arranged in cooperatives in areas with more land and fewer people in the form of small collectives (groups of three to five people) to participate in labor, and organize a group to tea gardens, vegetable gardens, aquaculture enterprises and farms to participate in collective production as much as possible; for some female cadres with poor working conditions and family burdens, mobilize them to engage in housework. The issues of retirement and retirement of old cadres who can no longer work shall be handled in accordance with the regulations of the central government. After the cadres are transferred, we must pay great attention to the consolidation work, and the above should not adopt the wrong attitude of "unloading the burden" and "pushing it out." The county, district, and township should care for the new soldiers on the labor front today as the army cares for the new soldiers. Once the transferred cadres come into contact with practical problems, some people may have ideological "regressions," and some people may encounter specific difficulties that need help to solve. Therefore, the provincial party committee also requires counties, districts, and townships to do a good job in welcoming and sending off, and cooperatives should help them arrange food, lodging, and production, and also often care for them politically and ideologically. The provincial party committee also plans to conduct a comprehensive inspection at an appropriate time to effectively solve the problems existing in the transferred cadres.

It is estimated that the task of transferring cadres in Jiangsu Province can be basically completed by the provincial-level organs in mid-December, and the whole province can be basically completed before mid-February next year. After this, the focus of rectification will shift to improving the system, delegating power, establishing institutions, revising rules and regulations, and improving work style and work methods. Launch the masses to air their views extensively, carry out in-depth debates and meticulous research, boldly change the unreasonable parts, and thoroughly correct the mistakes of the three isms of leadership, so that the Party's leadership over all aspects of work will take a step forward.

### 发扬革命精神紧缩机构　参加劳动锻炼能上能下  江苏十五万下放干部将走上生产岗位

    发扬革命精神紧缩机构　参加劳动锻炼能上能下
    江苏十五万下放干部将走上生产岗位
    本报讯　江苏省省级和南京市党政机关、全省第一批开展鸣放和整风的厂矿和大部分高等学校，在转入着重整改的第三阶段以后，首先把紧缩机构、下放干部加强劳动战线作为整改的重点，用打破常规的革命精神对待这一工作，因而推动全省迅速出现了一个干部参加劳动的高潮。据统计，从10月中旬到11月底，上述几个方面共下放干部一万一千多人，连同半年来整编中下放的干部已近七万人，其中有三万七千多人直接下放参加劳动。全省原定下放十三万人，从目前情况看，估计可能达到十五万人。
    去年年底，江苏省紧缩机构和下放干部工作的进度比较迟缓。原因是领导机关虽然对机构臃肿庞大和人浮于事的现象早有认识，但是当时对中央指示的体会不深，因此对机构设置和编外人员的出路安排缺乏革命精神和打破常规的措施。经过这次大鸣大放，特别是经过学习党的八届三中全会文件后，大家对紧缩机构的认识有了很大的提高。同时前一阶段的整编工作又已基本上摸清了机构和人员的情况。这就使领导机关深刻地体会到对干部进行劳动锻炼的迫切性和重要性，并且认为大批地下放干部的时机已经成熟。因此，中共江苏省委决定，不等机构编制确定，就按照省和市一级机关35％到50％，地委和专区机关40％，县15％到20％，企业和事业单位50％的比例下放干部。这样，就使这一工作不停留在编制、体制等问题的讨论上，而迅速地出现了一个跃进。形成了干部参加劳动的热潮。
    根据江苏省委的经验，为要使这一工作进行得又快又好，除必须首先统一领导干部的认识，下定决心以外，还必须有响亮的革命口号，进行大规模的政治动员。江苏省委首先把三中全会的精神在全体干部中作了传达和学习，并且提出了“参加劳动战线，加速实现我国由穷变富的技术文化革命”、“下乡上山，实现四十条”、“在劳动中把自己锻炼成为共产主义事业的接班人”等响亮的动员口号。这就改变了人们把下放干部当作“被精简掉”而产生的抵触情绪，使大家充分认识到参加劳动对于建设国家、改造自己的重大意义，使党的意图迅速变成了广大干部本身的迫切要求，他们把参加劳动看作一种豪迈的光荣的举动。同时，对某些有代表性的“农村无前途”、“大材小用”等错误论调，展开了讨论和辩论，集中批判了资产阶级轻视劳动的观点，批判了能上不能下、能为官不能为民的个人患得患失的思想。这样，参加劳动锻炼的问题，就成了一方面是每个干部以高度的自我牺牲精神，英勇地参加社会主义建设的问题；同时也是过社会主义“关”的问题，是两种思想和两条道路斗争的问题。这样广泛、深入的思想动员，不仅对于所有干部是必须的，而且在社会上起着移风易俗的作用。
    江苏省这次大批下放干部，采取了自上而下的深入动员、自下而上的申请报名和最后由领导批准的方式，采取了先进带动落后、群众自己教育自己的方式，采取了决心书（以大字报形式张贴）、光荣榜、欢送会、家属座谈会等方式，因而迅速形成了轰轰烈烈的群众运动，并且很快就使运动进入高潮。这种群众性的自觉运动，使领导上完全主动，也根本不存在编内编外的问题。并且这次还作到了从厅局长到省委书记都亲自动手，亲切而热情地找下放干部谈话，鼓舞他们向农村进军，锻炼改造自己，细致地帮助他们解决思想问题，也认真地帮助他们解决某些必须而又可能解决的实际困难。
    这种大刀阔斧的做法，必须辅之以全面规划和做好细致的组织工作。首先，省级机关和有关单位，对所有机构和人员全面排队，做到心中有数。同时，对下放干部和保持机关骨干，对干部的政治质量和业务水平，都作了统一的考虑，坚决执行党的干部路线，反对只重视干部的业务水平而忽视政治质量的偏向。对女干部与男干部一视同仁，防止排挤女干部。对有些方面，如文教战线和农村基层需要增加一批骨干，中小学教员清理以后需要补充缺额，也都统一考虑在内。在下放的次序上，先放直接参加劳动生产的，后放其他。凡家住农村、本人有劳动力者，一般都回乡参加劳动；有劳动力而家住城市或无家可归者，以小集体的方式（三五人为一组），尽量安排到地多人少地区的合作社参加劳动，并视可能组织一批到茶园、菜园、水产养殖企业和农场等地参加集体生产；对一部分工作条件很差而有家务牵累的女干部，动员她们从事家务劳动。对已经不能劳动的老干部的退职、退休问题，则按中央的规定办理。干部下放以后，必须大力注意巩固工作，上边不能采取“卸包袱”和“推出门了事”的错误态度，县、区、乡要像军队关心新战士那样，关心今天劳动战线上的新战士。下放干部一接触到实际问题，有些人可能思想“回潮”，有些人可能发生具体困难，需要帮助他们解决。因此，省委还要县、区、乡做好迎送工作，要合作社帮助他们安排食宿和生产，还要在政治思想上经常关心他们。省委还准备在适当时机作一次全面检查，切实解决下放干部中存在的问题。
    据估计，江苏省下放干部的任务，省级机关在12月中旬就可以基本完成，全省在明年2月中旬以前可以基本完成。在这以后，整改的重点将转入改进体制，权力下放，机构设置，修订规章制度，改进工作作风和工作方法。发动群众大鸣大放，展开深入的辩论和细致的研究，对不合理的部分要大胆地改，对领导上的三个主义要痛改前非，使党对各方面工作的领导跃进一步。
