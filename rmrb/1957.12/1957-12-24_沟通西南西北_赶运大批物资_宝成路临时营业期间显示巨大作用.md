Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, December 23rd: The Baoji-Chengdu Railway, traversing the Daba and Qinling Mountains, has already demonstrated its immense power during its temporary operation. Every day, one can see trains loaded with passengers, machinery, grain, and local products speeding along the line. Currently, the Baoji-Chengdu Railway operates seven passenger and freight trains daily between Chengdu and Baoji, transporting an average of over 3,000 passengers and 9,000 tons of goods per day.

In the past year, national construction materials transported via the Baoji-Chengdu Railway alone amounted to over 910,000 tons, ranking first in the railway's total transport volume. This year, construction materials and machinery for the Sichuan-Guizhou, Neijiang-Kunming, and other railways have been directly transported to the construction sites via this railway. More than half of the petroleum needed by Sichuan is transported in via this railway. The tens of thousands of tons of machinery and equipment transported monthly from other regions for the Chengdu Measuring & Cutting Tools Factory, Radio Equipment Factory, Thermal Power Plant, and other projects currently under construction in the Chengdu area are also almost entirely transported via the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. In October, the Chengdu Thermal Power Plant had a batch of machinery transported from the Soviet Union that needed to be installed within the year. However, the machinery was very large and heavy, with the largest weighing 60 tons. It would have been difficult to transport it to Chengdu via the Yangtze River. At that time, the railway department measured and compared the size of the machinery with the area of the railway tunnels and determined that it could pass through. They immediately allocated large heavy-duty freight cars and spent only three days transporting the machinery from Baoji to Chengdu.

The large-scale transportation of Sichuan grain and local products outwards, as well as the transportation of daily necessities, fertilizers, and agricultural implements into the southwest, is also a major task of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. The Sichuan Basin, known for its richness, was previously hampered by inconvenient transportation. Only 30,000 to 50,000 tons of grain were directly transported to the northwest each year. Most of the grain had to pass through the Yangtze River and detour through the Beijing-Hankou and Longhai Railways, circling half of China, before being transported to the northwest. After the Baoji-Chengdu Railway opened this year, it transported more than 640,000 tons of grain in one year. Sichuan's live pigs are also transported directly to Beijing by train. Freight cars heading south along this railway also transport an average of more than 500 tons of daily necessities, fertilizers, agricultural implements, and other goods to various parts of the southwest every day.

To adapt to the new situation after the opening of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, the Sichuan commercial, grain, service, and other departments have re-planned the province's material circulation routes. Before the Baoji-Chengdu Railway opened, the Sichuan Provincial Department of Commerce only had a few counties and cities where cotton cloth was transported via the Shaanxi-Sichuan Highway from Baoji. Now that the railway has opened, due to the shorter transportation time and lower transportation costs, cotton cloth from all 124 counties and cities in the province is transported via the Baoji-Chengdu Railway. At the same time, due to the opening of the railway, more than 800 vehicles originally operating on the Shaanxi-Sichuan Highway have now been transferred to the Chengdu-Hejiang, Sichuan-Tibet, and Sichuan-Yunnan highways, as well as the Sanmenxia and Tongchuan coal mine construction sites, to support key industrial construction and transportation needs in minority areas of the southwest.

The Baoji-Chengdu Railway began construction in 1952. From 1953, it undertook the task of transporting materials within Sichuan while being built section by section and operating section by section. By the end of last year, this railway had transported more than 2.85 million tons of materials, playing a significant role in supporting industrial and agricultural production and mountain area construction. So far this year, after the entire line was opened to traffic, the materials transported have reached more than 2 million tons, an increase of 2.7 times compared to last year.

    沟通西南西北　赶运大批物资
    宝成路临时营业期间显示巨大作用
    新华社成都23日电　横穿大巴山和秦岭的宝成铁路，在临时营业期间已经显示出巨大的威力。人们每天都可以在线路上看到奔驶着的满载旅客、机器、粮食和土特产的列车。现在，宝成铁路从成都到宝鸡每天对开七列客货列车，平均每天要运送旅客三千多人，载运物资九千吨。
    一年来，单是通过宝成铁路运送的国家建设物资，就有九十一万多吨，占铁路全部运量的首位。今年川黔、内昆等铁路的建设材料、机器设备，已通过这条铁路直送工地；供四川需用的石油，有一半以上是从这条铁路运进来的。今年成都地区正在兴建的量具刃具厂、无线电器材厂、热电厂等工程，每月从外地运来的成万吨机器设备，也几乎全部是取道宝成铁路。10月间，成都热电厂有一批从苏联运来的机器，要赶在年内安装，但机器体积和重量都很大，最大的重六十吨，假如绕道从川江运到成都是有困难的。当时铁路部门把机器体积和铁路隧道面积作了测量比较，认为可以通过，立即调拨了大型载重车皮，只花了三天时间就把机器从宝鸡运到成都。
    大批川粮、土特产的外运，以及日用百货、肥料、农具的运进西南，也是宝成铁路的主要任务。素称富饶的四川盆地，过去因为交通不便，每年直接运往西北的粮食只有三、五万吨，大部分粮食不得不经过川江，绕道京汉、陇海铁路，兜了半个中国，才运到西北。今年宝成铁路通车以后，一年就运出了六十四万多吨粮食。四川的生猪也由火车直接运往北京。沿这条铁路南驶的货车，平均每天也有五百多吨的日用百货、肥料、农具等运到西南各地。
    适应宝成铁路通车以后的新情况，四川商业、粮食、服务等部门，已经对全省物资流转路线重新作了规划。四川省商业厅在宝成铁路未通以前，全线只有几个县、市的棉布是经宝鸡由川陕公路运进的；现在铁路通车以后，由于运输时间缩短，运输成本降低，全省一百二十四个县、市的棉布都改经宝成铁路运输了。同时，由于铁路通车，原来行驶在川陕公路上的八百多辆汽车，现在已抽调到成河、川藏、川滇等公路和三门峡、铜川煤矿等工地，支援重点工业建设和西南少数民族地区的运输需要。
    宝成铁路是在1952年开始修筑的。从1953年起，它就在逐段修筑、逐段营业的情况下，担负起四川境内的物资运输任务，到去年年底，这条铁路一共运输了二百八十五万多吨物资，对支援工农业生产和山区建设起了很大作用。今年到目前为止，全线通车以后运输的物资已达二百多万吨，比去年增加二点七倍。
