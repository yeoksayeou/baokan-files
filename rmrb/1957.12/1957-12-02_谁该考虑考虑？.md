Who Should Consider?

A deputy section chief of the Cultural and Entertainment Supplies Company in Shenhe District, Shenyang City, said to his critics during the Rectification Movement: "You are my subordinates, under my leadership. What good will it do you to give me opinions? You should consider it."

Hearing this, people can't help but ask: Who exactly should be considering?

It seems that it is this deputy section chief comrade who should seriously consider things. He should carefully consider: What has the Party taught? Is he willing to be the dregs washed ashore by the surging Rectification Movement? ...

If the critics must consider something, then they will consider: How to more boldly expose these "terminally ill" patients of "bureaucratism" who are unaware of their condition, and resolutely fight them to the end!

### 谁该考虑考虑？

　  谁该考虑考虑？
    沈阳市沈河区文娱用品公司一位副科长在整风运动中对批评者说：“你是我的下级，在我领导之下。对我提意见，对你有什么好处？你要考虑考虑。”
    听了这个话，人们不禁要问：究竟谁该考虑考虑呢？
    看来，应该好好考虑考虑的倒是这位副科长同志。他应该好好考虑考虑：党是怎样教导的？自己是否甘心要作被汹涌澎湃的整风运动抛到岸上的渣滓？……
    如果一定要让批评者考虑考虑的话，那他们就会考虑：如何更大胆地揭发这种“病入膏肓”而不自知的“官僚主义病”患者，并同他们坚决斗争到底！
