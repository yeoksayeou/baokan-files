　　An Exciting Game of First Division Football
　　Tianjin Team Wins 1-0 Against "August First" Team
　　This newspaper reports Unexpectedly, the "August First" football team, which has not suffered a defeat in domestic competitions for the past two years, lost 0-1 to the Tianjin team in a National First Division Football League match held at the Xian Nong Tan Stadium in Beijing on the 1st.

　　At the beginning of the match, the "August First" team launched an offensive first, but soon the Tianjin team took the initiative, taking advantage of the tailwind. Just three minutes into the game, Tianjin's right winger Liu Yinpei fired the first "shot" from 25 meters away from the goal, but the ball went slightly to the left and out of bounds. After that, the Tianjin team used the tactics of spreading out the two wingers and then having the two inside forwards cut inside, launching multiple attacks on the "August First" team. They got many opportunities to shoot and corner kicks, but these many attacks were repelled one by one by the "August First" team's defense. At the same time as repelling the opponent's attack each time, the "August First" team launched an offensive in a timely manner. The "August First" team's forwards repeatedly inserted into the opponent's territory for powerful shots, but none of them hit the target. In the first half of 45 minutes, neither side scored a goal.

　　In the second half, the teams changed sides and fought again. The "August First" team played with the wind, and the offensive was even more fierce, but not long after, defender Jiang Jixiang, who had repeatedly made contributions in front of his own goal in the first half, was injured and left the field, replaced by Sun Yuming. When the game reached the fourteenth minute, Tianjin's right winger Liu Yinpei received the ball passed from the midfield by center forward Jin Changji, and quickly advanced forward. "August First" team defender Sun Yuming stepped forward to intercept, but was suddenly dodged by Liu Yinpei. Liu Yinpei lifted his foot and shot fiercely at the bottom line on the left side of the goal, and the ball hit the right post of the goal and bounced into the net. After conceding a goal, the "August First" team launched a fierce counterattack across the board, trying to reverse the defeat, but because the Tianjin team firmly defended its position, it was never able to score, and finally lost 0-1 to the Tianjin team.

　　The Tianjin team has now won the league championship in the Beijing-Tianjin area. If they can defeat the Shanghai Institute of Physical Education team, the Red Flag Sports Association team, the Wuhan Institute of Physical Education team, and the Nanjing Military Region team in the third stage of the league (to be held in Shanghai), they will secure this year's National First Division Football League championship.

　　On the 1st, before the match between the "August First" team and the Tianjin team, a friendly match was held at the Xian Nong Tan Stadium in Beijing between the veterans team - the Jinghua team and the Movie and Drama Association team. The Jinghua team won 6-2 against the Movie and Drama Association team.

　  甲级足球队的一场精彩比赛
　　天津队一比零胜“八一”队
    本报讯　出人意外，两年来在国内比赛中，一直没有打过败仗的“八一”足球队，1日在北京市先农坛体育场举行的全国足球甲级队联赛的一场比赛中以○比一输给了天津队。
    比赛开始，“八一”队首先展开攻势，但是不久天津队即乘顺风之势夺得了主动权。刚三分钟天津队右边锋刘荫培就在距门二十五公尺处射出第一“炮”，球稍为偏左越出界外。此后，天津队又利用了两边锋拉开然后两内锋向内插的战术，对“八一”队进行了多次进攻。他们获得了多次的射门和角球的机会，但是这许多进攻都被“八一”队后卫一一击退了。在每一次打退对方进攻的同时，“八一”队都及时地发动了攻势。“八一”队前锋曾多次地插到对方腹地进行劲射，但都未中的。上半场四十五分钟内，双方都没有打进一个球。
    下半场易地再战，“八一”队打顺风，攻势更为猛烈，但是时过不久，曾经在上半场于自己门前多次建功的后卫姜杰祥，因伤下场，由孙玉明替入。比赛进行到第十四分钟时，天津队右边锋刘荫培接得中锋金昌吉从中场传来的球后，迅速向前推进，“八一”队后卫孙玉明上前堵截，竟被刘荫培一下闪过，刘荫培在门左方底线举脚猛射，球中大门右柱弹入网内。“八一”队失一球后，全线展开猛烈反攻，力图挽回败局，但因天津队固守阵地，始终没能得分，最后以○比一输给了天津队。
    天津队现已获得了联赛京津区冠军。如果在联赛的第三阶段（在上海进行）中，他们能分别战胜上海体育学院队、红旗体协队，武汉体育学院队和南京部队队，就稳获今年全国足球甲级队联赛冠军。
    1日，在“八一”队和天津队比赛之前，老将队——京华队和剧影联队在北京市先农坛体育场举行了一场友谊比赛，京华队以六比二战胜剧影联队。
