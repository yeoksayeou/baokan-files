Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 8th (TASS dispatch): "The New Republic" magazine published an article by Hans Morgenthau entitled "The Decline of America." The author is the leader of the Center for the Study of American Foreign Policy at the University of Chicago.

Morgenthau wrote that a year ago, he also published some articles in this magazine entitled "The Decline of American Foreign Policy." He said, "In light of recent events, I now feel that what I then considered to be merely a crisis of American foreign policy is actually a crisis of America's actual strength and the American system of governance itself. What has happened to the United States has a very obvious dual significance. On the one hand, it has greatly weakened the prestige of the United States, and on the other hand, it has also weakened its actual strength."

Morgenthau pointed out that the technological superiority of the United States "has actually been shattered in front of the whole world." "Because the United States cannot regain its reputation as a great power in one sector, its greatness in all other aspects will inevitably be doubted... What the United States has lost from the perspective of prestige has also been lost from the perspective of strength." The author pointed out that the fact that the Soviet Union was able to launch considerably heavy satellites into outer space further demonstrated the sharp decline of America's actual strength.

After pointing out the changes in the balance of military power between the United States and the Soviet Union, Morgenthau wrote that all European countries "are beginning to consider that if they want to survive an atomic war, then they cannot be too closely linked to the United States, or not linked to the United States at all."

Morgenthau said that the United States is no longer the most powerful country in the world. It cannot match the Soviet Union in terms of actual strength and potential strength. The author believes that the decline of American prestige "is not due to a lack of money, nor to poor organization and poor work in cultivating scientific cadres (although these mistakes are very serious), but to the decline of the American government, to the decline of its philosophy and activities."

　　美国实力急剧衰落
　　“新共和”杂志载文论述美国声名狼借
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社纽约8日讯：“新共和”杂志刊载了汉森·摩根索的题为“美国的衰落”的文章，作者是芝加哥大学美国外交政策研究中心的领导人。
    摩根索写道，一年以前他也是在这个杂志上发表了一些题为“美国外交政策的衰落”的文章。他说：“结合近来的事件看，现在我觉得那时我所认为只是美国外交政策的危机的那些东西实际上是美国实际力量和美国统治制度本身的危机。美国所发生的事件非常明显地具有两重意义。一方面，它大大地削弱了美国的威信，另一方面，也削弱了它的实际力量。”
    摩根索指出，美国技术上的优势“实际上已经在全世界面前破灭了。”“由于美国不能在一个部门挽回自己大国的声誉，所以它在一切其他方面的伟大也必将受到怀疑……那种从威信角度看来美国失去了的东西，从实力观点看来也已经丧失了”。作者指出，苏联能够把相当重的卫星放射到宇宙空间去就更加显示出美国实际力量的急剧衰落。
    摩根索在指出美国和苏联军事力量对比的改变之后写道，所有的欧洲国家“开始考虑，如果他们想在原子战争中苟全性命，那么他们就不能过于紧密地与美国联结在一起，或者根本就不与美国联结在一起。”
    摩根索说，现在美国已经不是世界上最强大的国家了。它不能在实际力量和潜在力量方面同苏联匹敌。作者认为，美国威信的衰落“不在于缺钱，也不在于组织不好和培养科学干部工作不好（尽管这些错误是很严重的），而在于美国政府的衰落，在于它的哲学与活动的衰落。”
