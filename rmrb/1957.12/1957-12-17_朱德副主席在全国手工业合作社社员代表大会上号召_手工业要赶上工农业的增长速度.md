Xinhua News Agency, 16th. Vice Chairman Zhu De delivered a speech at the First Congress of Members of the All-China Handicraft Cooperative, saying that the gathering here of representatives of more than 100,000 handicraft cooperatives (groups) and more than 5 million members (group) to discuss further consolidating and developing handicraft cooperatives, to discuss and adopt the model charter of handicraft cooperatives, and to establish the All-China Handicraft Cooperative Federation is of great significance.

Vice Chairman Zhu said that China has always been a country known for its developed handicrafts. The diverse and high-quality products meticulously crafted by Chinese handicraft workers are not only loved by domestic consumers, but also welcomed by people from all over the world. Handicrafts occupy an important position in China's national economy. Handicrafts play a significant role in serving agricultural production, industrial production, basic construction, and transportation, meeting the needs of urban and rural people's lives, supplying a portion of export goods, helping to solve the employment of some of the social labor force, and accumulating some construction funds for the country. Because handicrafts can meet the above-mentioned diverse needs of the country and the people to a certain extent, our country can concentrate more power to develop large-scale industries. In this respect, handicrafts also make a significant contribution to China's socialist industrialization. Not only in the past and present, but also for a long time to come, handicrafts will be an indispensable assistant to state-owned large-scale industries. There are also many handicraft industries that must be preserved and continue to develop forever.

Vice Chairman Zhu pointed out that the holding of this congress marks the victory of great historical significance gained by the socialist road in China's handicraft sector. Last year, the socialist transformation of handicrafts, like the socialist transformation of agriculture and capitalist industry and commerce, had basically been realized. China has a total of 8 million professional handicraft workers, plus about 20 million handicraft workers engaged in fishery, salt industry, transportation, service industry, and part-time agriculture. Last year, more than 90 percent of handicraft workers had chosen the socialist path and participated in handicraft, fishery, salt industry, transportation, and agricultural cooperatives, and another part participated in state-owned enterprises and joint state-private enterprises. This is a great revolution in the ownership of the means of production in China's handicrafts. This year, with the victorious development of the struggle against the bourgeois rightists and the nationwide rectification movement, handicraft cooperatives in various parts of the country have also successively started rectification from August, so the socialist revolution on the political front and ideological front in the handicraft sector is also achieving victory.

Vice Chairman Zhu said that during the first five-year plan period, China's handicraft output value is expected to increase by 76.5 percent, which is 70.5 percent higher than the highest annual output in 1936 before liberation. On the basis of production development and increased labor productivity, in 1956, the average salary of members of handicraft cooperatives across the country increased by 66 percent compared with 1952. In that year, more than 90 percent of the members increased their labor income. What is particularly important is that the handicraft workers who were despised, oppressed, and exploited by foreign imperialism and Chinese landlords and capitalists in the old era have truly turned over and become masters of their own country and society along with the workers and farmers of the whole country due to the establishment of the People's Republic and their own participation in cooperatives.

Vice Chairman Zhu said that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, the Chinese people have victoriously completed and overfulfilled the first five-year plan for developing the national economy, and will start implementing the second five-year plan from next year. The basic task of the Chinese people is to complete the transition from capitalism to socialism in the next ten to fifteen years, build China into a powerful socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture, and catch up with and surpass Britain, which ranks second in the capitalist world in terms of output of various important industrial products, in about the next fifteen years. In order to realize this task, as our Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have repeatedly instructed, China's economic construction must implement the policy of fully paying attention to the development of agriculture and light industry under the premise of focusing on heavy industry. In the development of industry, it is necessary to implement the policy of combining the adoption of advanced technology with the full utilization of the potential of the original industry, and combining large, medium, and small-scale industries.

Vice Chairman Zhu then pointed out that according to the above-mentioned basic tasks and policies, the members of handicraft cooperatives across the country and all working cadres should assume important responsibilities. At present, handicraft cooperative organizations across the country must continue to carry out the rectification movement, while carrying out the rectification of the cooperatives, in order to achieve the purpose of raising the socialist awareness of the members, improving the leadership level of the cooperative cadres, and consolidating the cooperatives. The rectification movement is an effective method to solve the problem of who will win between the socialist and capitalist roads, and it is also an effective method to solve the contradictions within the working people, consolidate the political unity of the people, and promote production development. Therefore, handicraft production cooperatives not only need rectification now, but also should carry out rectification once a year or every other year for a long time to come.

Vice Chairman Zhu believes that in order to run handicraft production cooperatives well, it is necessary to implement the principles of democratic management and "more, faster, better, and more economical" development of cooperative production, and actively develop handicrafts that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood and have a broad foreign market. In order to run handicraft cooperatives well, it is also necessary to pay attention to correctly coordinating the interests of the state, the cooperative, and the individual members, and correctly handle the contradictions that may occur frequently between state-owned enterprises and handicraft cooperatives, and between agricultural cooperatives and handicraft cooperatives, according to the principle of overall planning and appropriate arrangements. All members of handicraft cooperatives must be made aware that the income of cooperative members can only be gradually improved with the development of production, and that the income of members of handicraft cooperatives should not be higher than the wages of workers in state-owned factories with higher labor productivity at any time, nor should it be too much higher than the income of farmers. Otherwise, it will harm the interests of the entire national construction and the political unity of the people of the whole country, which will also harm the long-term interests of the members of handicraft cooperatives. Under the principle of diligence and thrift in running cooperatives, the accumulation of cooperatives should be actively expanded in order to expand the production scale of cooperatives. On the other hand, local state organs at all levels must pay attention to ensuring that the collective ownership of the means of production by the working people of handicraft cooperatives is fixed for a long time, and that handicraft cooperatives should not be transformed into state-owned enterprises except in individual cases where it is extremely necessary and approved by the Party's provincial (municipal) committees. Otherwise, it will affect the consolidation and further development of handicraft cooperatives.

Vice Chairman Zhu said that the existing handicraft cooperatives also have the task of assisting the government in uniting, educating, and transforming individual handicraft households. Because handicraft cooperatives have not been fully consolidated and developed, and cannot fully meet the various daily needs of urban and rural residents, some handicraft workers still remain outside the cooperatives, and some new individual handicraft households will also appear. This situation is difficult to avoid for a certain period of time; as long as they do not engage in illegal business activities, their individual production is also allowed. However, we must resolutely struggle against those individual handicraft households who engage in illegal activities, and at the same time, we must always pay attention to uniting and educating all individual handicraft households and helping them to embark on the socialist road more quickly. In most parts of the country, there are already few individual handicraft households, so the work of uniting, educating, and transforming individual handicraft households in all walks of life can be entrusted to handicraft cooperatives in the same industry. This will be conducive to the overall planning of handicraft production and the regular education of individual handicraft households.

Vice Chairman Zhu also pointed out that handicrafts are an important part of local industry, and the local committees of the Communist Party of China at all levels and the local state administrative organs at all levels must further strengthen the leadership and management of handicraft cooperatives. We must also have sufficient possibility to strive to basically consolidate the existing handicraft cooperatives in three to five years, and enable the production of handicraft cooperatives to achieve a development during the second five-year plan that is not lower than the average growth rate of industry and agriculture, in order to meet the diverse needs of the people. As pointed out in the Party's "Eighth National Congress" proposal on the second five-year plan, during the second five-year plan, handicraft cooperatives, in addition to paying attention to rectification and consolidation of organizations, should also pay attention to preserving and continuing to carry forward the original advantages of these handicrafts, increase product varieties, and improve product quality. It should be particularly pointed out that the members of handicraft cooperatives should improve their technical level and labor proficiency, and young members should especially learn from veteran craftsmen, inherit all the excellent handicraft skills of our country, and carry them forward. In order to continue to develop handicraft production and improve labor productivity in handicrafts, cooperation between relevant departments should also be implemented.

Vice Chairman Zhu finally said that the nearly 20 million collective handicraft workers who have embarked on the socialist road of development are an important army in the socialist construction army of China's 640 million people, and are an important force in completing China's socialist construction cause. Like workers and collective farmers, the labor of collective handicraft workers is glorious. The people of our country, after the victory of the socialist transformation in 1956 and the victory of the anti-Rightist struggle and the nationwide rectification movement in 1957, have been further united on the basis of socialism and are striving to build a prosperous and happy socialist family. We will rely on the diligent and thrifty efforts of all the people of our country to build an advanced and prosperous socialist country on the land of an originally very backward and poor large oriental country. Our international conditions are very favorable, because we have the support and sympathy of socialist countries headed by the great Soviet Union and the broad masses of people all over the world; in the balance of international forces, the forces of peace, democracy, and socialism already have an indisputable advantage. Therefore, I believe that as long as our country's collective handicraft workers work together with collective farmers, the working class, and working intellectuals, unite as one, then, locally speaking, the task of consolidating and further developing handicraft cooperatives, and as a whole, the task of building a socialist society in our country, can be completely realized.

    朱德副主席在全国手工业合作社社员代表大会上号召
    手工业要赶上工农业的增长速度
    新华社16日讯　朱德副主席16日在中华全国手工业合作社第一次社员代表大会上作了讲话。他说，全国十万多个手工业合作社（组）的五百多万名社（组）员的代表，在这里集会，讨论进一步巩固和发展手工业合作社的问题，讨论和通过手工业合作社的示范章程，并且成立中华全国手工业合作总社，这是有重大意义的。
    朱副主席说，我国历来就是以手工业发达闻名于世界的国家。我国手工业劳动者所精心制作的花色多样、质量优美的产品，不仅受到国内消费者的喜爱，而且受到世界各国人民的欢迎。手工业在我国国民经济中占有一个重要的地位。手工业在为农业生产、工业生产、基本建设和交通运输事业服务，满足城乡人民的生活需要，供应一部分出口物资，帮助解决一部分社会劳动力就业问题和为国家积累一部分建设资金等方面，都具有重大的作用。由于手工业能够在一定程度上满足国家和人民的上述多方面的需要，我们的国家便能够集中更大的力量来发展大工业。从这方面来说，手工业对于我国的社会主义工业化建设，也有重大的贡献。不仅在过去和现在，而且在今后很长时期中，手工业都将是国营大工业的不可缺少的助手。还有许多手艺工业，是要永远保存和继续发展的。
    朱副主席指出，这次大会的举行，标志着社会主义道路在我国手工业部门中所获得的具有伟大历史意义的胜利。在去年，手工业的社会主义改造，同农业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造一样，已经基本上实现。我国共有专业手工业者八百万人，加上从事渔业、盐业、交通运输业、服务业和兼营农业的手工业者，共约二千万人。去年，百分之九十以上的手工业者都已经选择了社会主义的道路，分别参加了手工业、渔业、盐业、交通运输业和农业合作社，另外有一部分参加了国营企业和公私合营企业。这是我国手工业在生产资料所有制方面所发生的大革命。今年，随着反对资产阶级右派的斗争和全民整风运动的胜利发展，全国各地的手工业合作社从八月起也陆续开始整风，因而在手工业部门中，在政治战线上和思想战线上的社会主义革命，也正在取得胜利。
    朱副主席说，第一个五年计划期间，我国手工业产值预计将增长百分之七十六点五，比解放前年产量最高的一九三六年将增长百分之七十点五。在生产发展和劳动生产率提高的基础上，在一九五六年，全国手工业合作社社员的工资平均比一九五二年增长了百分之六十六，这一年，百分之九十以上的社员都增加了劳动收入。特别重要的是，在旧时代受到外国帝国主义和中国地主、资产阶级的贱视、压迫和剥削的手工业劳动者，由于人民共和国的建立和他们自己加入了合作社，已经真正翻过身来，和全国工人、农民在一起成为自己国家和社会的主人了。
    朱副主席说，在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，我国人民已经胜利地完成和超额完成了发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，从明年起就将开始执行第二个五年计划。我国人民的基本任务，就是要在今后十年到十五年内，走完从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期，把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的强大的社会主义国家，并且要在今后十五年左右的时间内，在各种重要工业产品的产量方面，赶上和超过工业产量占资本主义世界第二位的英国。为着实现这个任务，正如我们党中央和毛主席所多次指示的，我国的经济建设，必须执行在以重工业为中心的前提下充分注意发展农业和轻工业的方针。而在发展工业方面，则必须执行使采用先进技术和充分利用原有工业的潜力相结合，使大型、中型和小型工业相结合的方针。
    朱副主席接着指出，根据上面所说的基本任务和方针，全国手工业合作社的社员和全体工作干部，应当承担起重大的责任。在目前，全国手工业合作组织必须继续开展整风运动，同时进行整社，以便达到提高社员群众的社会主义觉悟，提高合作社干部的领导水平，巩固合作社的目的。整风运动是解决社会主义和资本主义两条道路谁胜谁负问题的有效方法，同时也是解决劳动人民内部的矛盾、巩固人民的政治团结和推动生产发展的有效方法。因此，手工业生产合作社不仅现在需要整风，就是今后长时期内也应当每年或隔一年整一次风。
    朱副主席认为，为了办好手工业生产合作社，必须贯彻执行民主办社和“又多、又快、又好、又省”地发展合作社生产的勤俭办社原则，积极地发展对于国计民生有利和有广大的国外市场的手工业。为了办好手工业合作社，还必须经常注意正确地协调国家、合作社和社员个人三方面的利益，根据统筹兼顾、适当安排的原则，正确地处理经常可能发生的国营企业和手工业合作社之间，以及农业合作社和手工业合作社之间的矛盾。必须使全体手工业合作社的社员认识，合作社社员的收入，只能随着生产的发展而逐渐得到进一步的提高，而且手工业合作社社员的收入，无论什么时候都不应当高于劳动生产率更高的国营工厂工人的工资，同时也不应当过高于农民的收入。否则，就会危害到整个国家建设的利益和全国人民的政治团结，也就是会危害到手工业合作社社员的长远利益。在勤俭办社的原则下，应当积极地扩大合作社的积累，以便扩大合作社的生产规模。另一方面，各级地方国家机关必须注意使手工业合作社的劳动人民集体所有制长期地固定下来，除了极端必要并且经过党的省
  （市）委批准的个别情况以外，不应当把手工业合作社转变为国营企业。否则，就会影响到手工业合作社的巩固和进一步发展。
    朱副主席说，现有的手工业合作社，还担负有协助政府团结、教育和改造个体手工业户的任务。由于手工业合作社还没有充分巩固和发展起来，还不能充分地满足城乡居民的各种日常需要，一部分手工业者还留在合作社以外，同时还会出现一部分新的个体手工业户，这种情况在一定时期内，是难以避免的；只要他们不从事违法的经营，他们的个体生产也是允许的。但是，我们必须坚决地同那些从事违法活动的个体手工业户进行斗争，同时经常注意团结和教育所有的个体手工业户，帮助他们更快地走上社会主义道路。在全国大多数地区，个体手工业户，已经为数不多，因此，对各行各业的个体手工业户的团结、教育和改造工作，可以委托同一个行业的手工业合作社管起来。这样将会有利对手工业生产进行统筹安排，和对个体手工业户进行经常的教育。
    朱副主席还指出，手工业是地方工业的重要的组成部分，中国共产党的各级地方委员会和各级地方的国家行政机关，必须进一步地加强对于手工业合作社的领导和管理。我们必须也有充分的可能争取在三年到五年内把现有的手工业合作社基本上巩固起来，并且使手工业合作社的生产在第二个五年计划期间获得不低于工农业的平均增长速度的发展，以便满足人民的多方面的需要。正如党的“八大”关于第二个五年计划的建议所指出，在第二个五年计划期间，手工业合作社除了应当注意整顿和巩固组织之外，还应当注意保存和继续发扬这些手工业原来的优点，增加产品品种，提高产品质量。特别应当指出的是，手工业合作社的社员们都应当提高技艺水平和劳动的熟练程度，年青的社员们特别应当向老工艺人学习，把我国一切优良的手工技艺都继承下来，并且加以发扬光大。为了继续发展手工业生产和提高手工业的劳动生产率，还应当实行有关部门之间的协作。
    朱副主席最后说，已经走上了社会主义的发展道路的近两千万的集体手工业劳动者，是我国六亿四千万人所组成的社会主义建设大军的一支重要的方面军，是完成我国社会主义建设事业的一个重要的力量。和工人、集体农民一样，集体手工业者的劳动是光荣的。我国全体人民，经过一九五六年社会主义改造的胜利和一九五七年反右派斗争和全民整风运动的胜利，已经在社会主义的基础上进一步地团结起来，为建成繁荣幸福的社会主义大家庭而奋斗。我们将依靠我国全体人民勤劳和节俭的努力，在原来很落后和贫穷的一个东方大国的土地上，建成一个先进和富强的社会主义国家。我们的国际条件是很有利的，因为我们有着以伟大的苏联为首的社会主义各国和全世界广大人民的支持和同情；在国际的力量对比中，和平、民主和社会主义的力量，已经具有无可争辩的优势。因此，我相信，只要我国集体手工业者同集体农民，工人阶级和劳动知识分子在一起，团结一致地努力，那末，就局部说，巩固和进一步发展手工业合作社的任务，就整体说，在我国建成社会主义社会的任务，都是完全可以实现的。
