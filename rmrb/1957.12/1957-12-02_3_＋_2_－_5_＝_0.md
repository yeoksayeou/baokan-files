　　The teachers at the adult education school say that Xiao Fang is doing well in her studies, and the masters in the electrical workshop also praise Xiao Fang for her hard work. If you ask Xiao Fang why she studies so well, she is sure to pout at you, and with an air of "is it even worth asking," she will say:
　　"Why? It's very simple, I don't want to be a 3+2-5 at work!"
　　Many people who hear this are baffled.
　　This happened last autumn.
　　In order to complete the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, the electrical workshop was particularly busy. One day, Xiao Fang was installing the electromagnetic switch of an electric crane by herself. Installing this thing is not a simple matter. Xiao Fang worked on it all day and finally installed it, but the master was nowhere to be found to test the crane. Xiao Fang waited and waited, getting really bored! Later, she simply sat on the grass at the entrance of the electrical workshop, picked a wild flower, tore off the petals one by one and threw them away, chanting in her heart:
　　"Qualified, unqualified; qualified, unqualified..." Suddenly, a petal flew to the left, and Xiao Fang sighed and said, "Oh no, the electric crane installation must be unqualified, see, the petals have fallen to the left..."
　　"Xiao Fang, what are you doing?" The master shouted to her: "Come to the workshop quickly, we are going to test the crane soon!"
　　"Okay, I'm coming—!" Xiao Fang flipped over and ran away in a flash.
　　The test results showed that the electric crane moved up, down, left and right very flexibly. The worker driving the crane greeted Xiao Fang loudly:
　　"Thank you, electrician!"
　　Xiao Fang waved her hand and said with a smile: "It's nothing, we should do this to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule—!"
　　Xiao Fang was very happy that day, and Xiao Fang's master also stroked his beard with satisfaction, and specially brought a book from home and gave it to Xiao Fang, saying:
　　"Here is a 'Electrical Engineering Manual' for you, there are a lot of advanced technologies in it!"
　　Xiao Fang took the book and flipped through it in surprise, flipping through it, suddenly shouting:
　　"Master, what are these things drawn on it?"
　　Xiao Fang's master explained it to Xiao Fang for a while, but Xiao Fang still didn't understand. Finally, her master sighed and said: "Alas, your education is low, this 'Electrical Engineering Manual' requires junior high school level to understand, this gift is not appropriate for you, you taking it is also 3+2-5=0!" After saying that, he took the gift back.
　　Gifts or no gifts, Xiao Fang didn't care, but the sentence her master said unintentionally stung her heart. Xiao Fang thought: Yes, my education is low; but is low education 3+2-5=0?
　　One morning, Xiao Fang was connecting the wire for a young welder, and kept making mistakes. The rash young man became impatient and said angrily:
　　"Forget it, how much auxiliary time are you wasting for me! I think you are fiddling around like this, and it is still 3+2-5=0!"
　　These words touched Xiao Fang's pain again, and she turned around and ran back to the electrical workshop. The young man took a broken wire and stood there, still confused.
　　That night, Xiao Fang wrote in her diary:
　　"I am seventeen years old, I am not young anymore! Why am I still crying? It would be embarrassing if others saw it! But, I can't listen to the sentence 3+2-5=0 anymore! Am I really a 0? No, no, a thousand no's, ten thousand no's! I must study culture, catch up, it is difficult to master advanced technology without culture, and it is even more difficult to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule..."
　　From then on, Xiao Fang studied culture with special dedication. She didn't know where she found a small iron plate, whether it was during rest or night shift, she was either doing exercises on the small iron plate with chalk, or burying her head in reading. When she didn't understand something, she would ask this person, and ask that person, everyone became her teacher.
　　Xiao Fang loved to doze off when she was on the night shift guarding the electric meter. She didn't know who told her that to cure this sleepiness, it is best to use paper twists to clear the nose. She did as she was told, but it didn't work, she sneezed and her eyelids still couldn't open, making the comrades think she had the flu.
　　Xiao Fang tried all kinds of methods, and finally when she felt sleepy, she ran outside and did a few sections of broadcast gymnastics "one two three four", and then wrote on the small iron plate, answering herself:
　　"Are you willing to be a 3+2-5 at work?
　　No, I don't want to be.
　　If you don't want to be, why are you still dozing off when you are studying on duty?
　　…"
　　In this way, Xiao Fang learned little by little, remembered, recited, and did, and in the blink of an eye, a year had passed.
　　At the end of the semester, Xiao Fang got five points in every subject. Xiao Fang's master told her:
　　"Now that you are reading the third volume of junior high school, I can give you my 'Electrical Engineering Manual' to read."
　　Xiao Fang said: "No need, master, I already bought it!"

　　3＋2－5＝0
　　翟航
    业余学校老师说小芳学习成绩不错，电工房老师傅们也夸小芳学习很用心。你如果问小芳为什么学得好，她准向你一撇嘴，做个那还用问的神气说：
    “为啥？很简单，我不愿在工作上做个3＋2－5呗！”
    这话很多人听了都摸不着头脑。
    这是去年秋季的事了。
    为了提前完成第一个五年计划，电工房的工作特别忙碌。一天，小芳一个人安装一部电行车的电磁开关，安装这玩艺可不是件简单事，小芳弄了一天总算装好了，可是找师傅来试车，师傅又不知到那去了。小芳等呀，等呀，等得实在闷人！后来她索性坐在电工房门口的草地上，摘了朵野花，一瓣一瓣地扯下来扔出去，心里在念着：
    “合格，不合格；合格，不合格……”忽然，一瓣花飞到了左边，小芳叹了口气说：“糟了，电行车安装一定不合格，看嘛，花瓣都落到左边了……”
    “小芳，你在干啥？”师傅在喊她：“快到车间来，马上要试车啦！”
    “嗳，来啦——！”小芳一翻身，一溜烟地跑去了。
    试车结果，电行车开起来上下、左右都很灵活。开行车的工人向小芳大声地打着招呼：
    “谢谢你啦，电工师傅！”
    小芳摆着手，笑着说：“没啥，为了提前完成五年计划，这是我们应该做的——！”
    这天，小芳可高兴了，小芳的师傅也满意地捋着胡子，还特意从家里带来一本书，送给小芳，说：
    “送你一本‘电工手册’，这上面，高深的技术可多了！”
    小芳接过书惊喜地翻着，翻着，忽然嚷起来：
    “师傅，这上面画了些啥呀？”
    小芳的师傅给小芳讲解了一阵，小芳还是弄不懂。末了，她师傅叹了口气说：“唉，你的文化低，这‘电工手册’要初中水平才能看得懂，这个礼物送给你不恰当，你拿了它也是3＋2－5＝0！”说罢，又把这份礼物收回去了。
    礼物不礼物，小芳是不在乎的，但她师傅无意中说的这句话，却刺痛了她的心。小芳想：是呀，我的文化低；但是文化低就是3＋2－5＝0吗？
    一天早上，小芳给一个年青的电焊工接皮线，接来接去，总出岔。那个毛毛楞楞的年青人等得不耐烦，生气说：
    “算了，你耽误我多少辅助时间！我看你这样拨弄来，拨弄去，还是个3＋
  2－5＝0！”
    这话又触到小芳的痛处了，她转身便跑回电工房。那个年青人拿了根断皮线，楞在那里，还莫名其妙。
    那晚，小芳在日记上写着：
   “我已经十七岁啦，已经不小啦！为什么我还哭呢？别人看到了多丢人！但是，我再也不能听3＋2－5＝0这句话了！难道我真是个0吗？不，不，一千个不，一万个不！我一定要学文化，赶上去，没文化要掌握高深的技术，是困难的，要提前完成五年计划，更是困难的……。”
    从这以后，小芳学文化特别专心了。她不知从那儿找了块小铁板，不论休息也好，值夜班也好，不是用粉笔在小铁板上做着习题，便是埋着头在看书。不懂的地方，她便问这个，请教那个，大家都成了她的老师。
    小芳做夜班守电表的时候，最爱打瞌睡。她不知听谁说的，要治这瞌睡病，最好用纸捻通鼻子。她照着做了，但是不行，她一边打喷嚏，一边眼皮还是睁不开，弄得同志们都以为她得了流行性感冒病。
    小芳法子想尽了，最后她瞌睡来了，就跑到室外“一二三四”地做几节广播体操，然后就在小铁板上自问自答地写着：
    “你愿在工作上做个3＋2－5吗？
    不，我不愿做。
    不愿做，为什么你值班自学还打瞌睡呢？
        ……”
    就这样，小芳一点一点地学着，记着，念着，做着，眨眨眼，一年时间就过去了。
    学终期考，小芳门门功课都得五分。小芳师傅跟她说：
    “你现在读初中三册，我那本‘电工手册’可以送给你看了。”
    小芳说：“不用啦，师傅，我早买啦！”
