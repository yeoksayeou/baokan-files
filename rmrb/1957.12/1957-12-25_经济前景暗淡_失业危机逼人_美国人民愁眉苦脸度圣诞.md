　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 24th: On the eve of Christmas, the December 20th issue of "U.S. News & World Report" stated: From the East Coast to the West Coast, the results of surveys show that Americans are not in a joyful mood. "They are confused today. They are worried and agitated. People are deeply concerned about the economic prospects."

　　"Housewives are panicked by the rising cost of living, farmers are dissatisfied with the rising cost of agricultural production while the prices of agricultural products remain unchanged, and workers are worried about whether they will have work to do next year and whether they can rely on overtime work to earn more for living expenses."

　　William Schnitzler, Secretary of the AFL-CIO, recently described the lives of American workers, saying: Thirty million American families have an annual income of less than $2,000, which is less than $40 per week. Many of them are starving.

　　Christmas did not bring joy to African Americans either. Several famous actors from the American black theater group "Porgy and Bess," which had performed in Moscow, were still trapped in the misery of unemployment as Christmas approached. Joe Attles, the protagonist of the group, said, "I am in good health, I can do almost any job, but no one wants me." Famous actor Owen Barnes had to temporarily work as a mail collector at the post office, and another actor, George Hul, had to scrape by in a clothing store in Manhattan. Jerry Laws, the director of this world-renowned black theater group, also had to work for a car dealer. He said he had sent out 200 job applications, but to no avail.

　　The "gift" that the U.S. government gave to the people on the eve of Christmas was: Many civil and military officials and members of Congress were loudly clamoring, demanding that the people "tighten their belts" in order to bear more military spending.

### 经济前景暗淡　失业危机逼人  美国人民愁眉苦脸度圣诞

    经济前景暗淡　失业危机逼人
    美国人民愁眉苦脸度圣诞
    据新华社24日讯　纽约消息：在圣诞节前夕，20日一期的“美国新闻与世界报道”说：从东海岸到西海岸，调查的结果表明美国人没有欢乐情绪，他们“今天心中混乱。他们担心事、激动不安，人们对经济的前景忧心忡忡”。
    “家庭主妇们对日益上升的生活费用感到心慌意乱，农民们对农业生产费用日益上涨而农产品价格保持不动表示不满，工人们担心明年是否有工作做，担心明年是否可以依靠加班工作多筹一些生活费。”
    劳联—产联秘书威廉·希尼兹勒最近描述美国工人的生活说：有三千万个美国家庭全年收入不到两千美元，即每星期不到四十美元。他们中有许多人在挨饿。
    圣诞节更没有给美国黑人带来欢乐。曾经在莫斯科进行过访问演出的美国著名黑人剧团“波基和贝斯”的几位著名演员在临近圣诞的时候还陷在失业的苦难中。这个剧团的主角乔·阿特利斯说：“我正在身强力壮的时候，我几乎可以做任何工作，但是没有一个人要我。”著名男演员欧文·巴恩斯不得不在邮政局暂时充当收信员，另一位男演员乔治·赫尔不得不在曼哈顿的一家成衣店中混饭吃。这个满载世界声誉的黑人剧团的导演杰里·劳斯也不得不在一个汽车推销商处工作。他说，他曾经发出二百封求职信，但是毫无结果。
    美国政府在圣诞前夕送给人民的“礼物”是：许多文武官员和议员在大声叫嚷，要求人民“束紧腰带”，以便负担更多的军事开支。
