A waterwheel that can draw water uphill

    The Jun County Farm Implement Factory in Hubei Province has successfully trial-produced a bucket-type waterwheel that can draw water from a low-lying river up a hillside. This waterwheel requires neither human nor animal power, and can be driven as long as there is water in the river. This waterwheel is very useful in mountainous areas and highlands.

    能引水上山的水车
    湖北省均县农具厂，试制成功一种能把低处河水引上山坡的戽斗式水车。这种水车既不用人力也不用畜力，只要河里有水就可以带动。这种水车在山区和高地用处很大。
