　　Labor and Happiness
　　Hu Huiling
　　Dimitrovgrad, a heroic city! This city was built by the Bulgarian people with their own hands, under extremely difficult conditions, out of their boundless love for the great communist fighter, Dimitrov. The film "Heroic City," which reflects this event, although it does not have particularly outstanding artistic creation; however, the fervent labor passion of ordinary people that it praises deeply moved me and made me more deeply aware of the meaning and value of labor.
　　Labor is painful in exploitative societies, even though it creates everything. But when it gains freedom and becomes a conscious, collective force, it becomes a heroic undertaking, a source of happiness.
　　In the film, Shelyu, the young man who used to look at people sideways and was undisciplined but brave and fearless, could he have become a strong and promising person if he hadn't been in this socialist labor furnace, if he hadn't been taught, criticized, and inspired by the collective force of labor?
　　Baugdan, the strong bricklayer who only cared about immediate interests, if he had left this great construction project halfway according to his own ideas, could he have become such a cheerful and happy husband and father, could he have faced his comrades and the second generation with such a clear conscience?
　　Let's talk about the upright and decisive Nevina. When the construction project turned from ideal into reality, didn't she also become more mature, not only transforming from an ordinary female worker into a skilled welder; at the same time, her thoughts and her soul were also tempered to be stronger and more perfect?
　　All of this is happiness! What is more gratifying than the transformation and growth of people? And all of this comes from socialist collective labor.
　　True friendship and love can only be created in such labor. Shelyu and Nevina were originally people who didn't understand or know each other, and at first they even seemed very different. However, based on their integrity and enthusiasm, and based on their having withstood the tempering of labor, they naturally progressed from frequent fierce arguments to sincere mutual help, to the development of genuine love. Although all perfect love does not completely follow the path of Shelyu and Nevina, their love makes us feel that it can stand the test. The close and seamless friendship between Soviet engineer Vasily and Shelyu, and between Soviet female welding technician Lyuda and Nevina, is also heartwarming. The Soviet people's selfless assistance and deep friendship towards the people of fraternal countries is not only manifested in spiritual and material aspects, not only in fighting side by side, but also develops more intimately in common labor.
　　Why did the film give me so many feelings, so unforgettable? I think it is precisely because it complexly and richly displays the characters' labor life, displays the spiritual outlook of our era; it not only shows the birth of a socialist city, but also praises the growth of socialist new people. After watching this movie, I also thought of the tens of thousands of comrades in our country who are actively responding to the Party's call to go to the countryside, mountainous areas, and mines. They will certainly also become true and strong communist fighters through the tempering of socialist labor.

### 劳动和幸福

　　劳动和幸福
　　胡惠玲
    季米特洛夫城，英雄的城！这座城是保加利亚人民怀着对伟大的共产主义战士——季米特洛夫的无比热爱，用自己的双手，在极端困难的条件下修建起来的。反映这一事件的影片“英雄城”，虽然没有特别出色的艺术创造；然而它所歌颂的平凡人的火热的劳动激情，却深深使我感动，使我更深切地认识到劳动的意义和价值。
    劳动在剥削社会里是痛苦的，虽然它创造了一切。但当它获得了自由并成为自觉的、集体的力量以后，就成为豪迈的事业，成为幸福的泉源了。
    影片中那个惯于斜着眼睛看人、散漫成性但却勇猛无畏的年青人舍柳，如果不是在这社会主义的劳动洪炉里，如果没有劳动着的集体力量的教导、批评和激发，他能成一个坚强的有为的人么？
    那个身强力壮但却只顾眼前利益的瓦工保格丹，如果他根据自己的想法，半途离开了这伟大的建筑工程，他能成为那么开朗愉快的丈夫和父亲，他能那么毫无愧色地面对着他的同志们和第二代么？
    就说正直果敢的涅维娜吧，当建造工程由理想变成现实的时候，她不也更加成熟，不仅由一个普通女工变成了熟练的电焊工；同时，她的思想、她的心灵，也都锻炼得更结实了、更完美了么？
    这一切就是幸福！有什么比人的改造和成长更令人欣慰的呢？而这些，又都是来自社会主义的共同劳动。
    真正的友谊和爱情也只有在这样的劳动中缔造。舍柳和涅维娜本是不了解也不相识的人，而且最初看起来甚至是很不相同的人。可是，基于他们的正直热情、基于他们经受住了劳动的锻炼，很自然地，他们便由经常激烈的争吵，到互相热诚的帮助，到发生了真挚的爱情。虽然，所有美满的爱情并不完全沿着舍柳和涅维娜的路线产生，可是他们的爱情却使我们感到，那是能经得起考验的。苏联工程师瓦西里和舍柳，苏联女电焊技工留达和涅维娜之间的亲密无间的友情，也是使人心动的。苏联人民对兄弟国家人民的无私援助和深长情谊，不仅表现在精神的和物质的方面，不仅表现在并肩战斗方面，而且在共同的劳动中更加发展、更加亲切。
    影片为什么会给了我这么多的感受，这么不能忘怀呢？我想，正是由于它复杂而多采地展示了人物的劳动生活、展示了我们这个时代的精神面貌；它不仅表现了一座社会主义城市的诞生，也歌颂了社会主义新人的长成。看过这部电影后，我也联想到我国成千上万积极响应党的号召走向农村、山区和矿场的同志们，他们一定也将同样在社会主义劳动的锻炼中，成为真正的、坚强的共产主义战士。
