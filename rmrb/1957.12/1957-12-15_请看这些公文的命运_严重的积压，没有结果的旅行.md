　　Look at the Fate of These Official Documents
　　——Severe Backlog, Unfruitful Journey

　　In the central state organs, thousands upon thousands of official documents flow ceaselessly every day, moving from the central government to local areas, from one ministry to another, from one department, bureau, division, section to another. They convey important guidelines, policies, instructions, decisions, requests for instructions, and reports. They embody a part of our national political life. However, due to the bureaucratic attitude of the leaders in some departments toward these official documents, serious backlogs and the phenomenon of "document travel" have resulted, causing undue losses to the work. During this period of extensive airing of views, the masses have powerfully exposed and severely criticized this undesirable phenomenon in big-character posters.

　　Yesterday's News

　　From many big-character posters in state organs, it can be seen that because a draft has to go through many levels before it leaves the gate, many urgent matters become yesterday's news. A big-character poster from the Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry stated that in the summer of 1956, the Wuhan Metallurgical Construction General Company of the Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry submitted an official document to the Ministry regarding measures for heatstroke prevention, requesting instructions. The Construction Bureau of the Ministry did not approve it until November, when the cold winter had already arrived, at which point heatstroke prevention was no longer needed, but cold prevention was. A big-character poster from the Ministry of Finance, titled "A Top-Priority Document Sleeping in the Industrial Department for a Month and a Half," stated: In order to solve the serious shortage of asbestos in 1957, the State Economic Commission issued a top-priority document on June 27, 1957, notifying an increase of several tens of thousands of yuan in investment in the Sichuan Asbestos Mine. This document arrived at the Industrial Department of the Ministry of Finance on July 1st and went to sleep, until the representatives of the Sichuan Provincial Planning Commission came to Beijing for a meeting in August and inquired about the top-priority document that had been sleeping in the Industrial Department for a month and a half. Due to the serious backlog, several long-distance calls were made and official letters were written between higher and lower levels to inquire about this matter, which not only cost a lot of manpower and material resources, but more importantly, affected the rapid development of asbestos production. A big-character poster from the Ministry of Construction Engineering stated that on June 22, 1957, the Planning Department, the Capital Construction Department, and the Finance Department held a meeting to determine that the economic accounting system of the joint processing plant should be changed to reduce enterprise losses and disputes in foreign settlements. However, when this document was sent from the Planning Department to the Capital Construction Department for countersigning, it was held up until October 24th, and only returned after inquiries. Because the time was dragged on for too long, it resulted in undue expenses of more than 970,000 yuan for the enterprise.

　　A cadre from the Planning Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce wrote a big-character poster stating that he drafted a working bulletin in late April 1957, which was passed up through various levels to the minister, and then there was no further news. After repeated inquiries, the returned document had the following words written in the vice minister's instruction: "This document has been held up for a long time, it has lost its effectiveness, do not issue it." The date signed was July 1st. The cadre who wrote this big-character poster questioned: Why did a document take two months to process, and without hearing any specific revisions from the minister, it could not leave the gate and became "ineffective"? He demanded a reply from the ministry leaders. Seven cadres from the Ministry of Justice jointly wrote a big-character poster criticizing the procrastination in legal interpretation work. The big-character poster stated that, taking the documents handled by the Legislation Compilation Department as an example, among the 107 documents processed in 1956, only 35.5% were answered within one month, 33.6% were answered within three months, and the rest were answered after three months, with some individual cases being backlogged for as long as a year and a half before being answered.

　　No One in Charge

　　A big-character poster from the Production Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering stated: The Central South Fourth Company requested instructions in December 1956 regarding the scrapping of bamboo-reinforced concrete hollow floor slab materials. After the document arrived, the handling unit filed the document away without replying for half a year. In May 1957, the Central South Fourth Company sent a letter urging a reply, and only then was the document retrieved from the file cabinet. However, due to the unsound working system and responsibility system, the Technology Department, the Finance Department, and the Production Bureau all believed that it was not the task of their own units, so they had to return the document to the General Office for re-handling. Two secretaries of two vice ministers of the Ministry of Finance wrote a big-character poster titled "An Official Document Backlogged for Nearly Four Years," criticizing the procrastination of the vice ministers. The big-character poster stated that the issue of the supervision and destruction of damaged RMB and government bonds by the People's Bank was instructed by the former Government Administration Council Finance and Economics Committee in 1953: "The financial department should be the main party, sending personnel to supervise the destruction." However, many problems occurred in the implementation process, and as early as 1954, 40 provinces, cities, and province-administered cities raised many opinions. However, the relevant vice minister did not study and actively handle the issue well. Although three vice ministers successively reviewed the document, it was not resolved. The instructions of these three vice ministers were: Vice Minister Jin Ming instructed: "This issue has been dragging on for a long time and has not been resolved." He believed that "having the Supervision Department of the Ministry of Finance supervise the destruction is somewhat formalistic, but it does not seem appropriate to completely reject it, and the bank also disagrees." He "wants the Supervision Department to study it again." Vice Minister Rong Zihe believed: "This is a legislative procedure issue, and it is not appropriate to evade it. Please Vice Minister Hu consider it again." Vice Minister Hu Lijiao expressed agreement with the Supervision Department's opinion, suggesting that the State Council clearly stipulate that the financial department no longer send personnel to participate in the supervision and destruction, and that the bank destroy them on its own. He also gave a verbal instruction: "The Supervision Department should report to Vice Minister Rong again." After that, he never inquired about it again. Over the years, some provinces and cities have sent letters and telegrams requesting instructions, but the Ministry of Finance has been slow to respond, and the problem has been dragged on until recently, when preparations were made to study the handling method.

　　"Travel" with No Results

　　A big-character poster from the Ministry of Urban Construction stated: In July 1956, the Ministry of Urban Construction received a document from the Ministry of Public Security "Rules on the Management of Explosive Materials," soliciting the opinions of this ministry. The General Office forwarded it to the Security Department, the Security Department forwarded it to the Planning Bureau, the Planning Bureau held it for 20 days and then forwarded it to the Design Bureau, the Design Bureau held it for eight days and sent it to the Public Utilities Bureau, the Public Utilities Bureau held it for 14 days and then returned it to the General Office. Everyone circled their names on it, without offering any opinions. After more than two months of "travel," the final destination was "filing." A big-character poster from the Ministry of Forestry, titled "The Fate of an Official Document," stated that on April 10th, a document was received from the Ministry of Forest Industry "Regarding the increase in the production of third-grade papermaking timber, second-grade pit props, treetop wood, coarse branches and twigs, and logs, etc., all wood products may be exempt from silviculture fees." It was sent to the Planning and Finance Department that day, but that department said it should be handled by the Business Bureau, and the Business Bureau returned it, saying it should be handled by the Planning and Finance Department. The Planning and Finance Department still said that it should be handled by the Business Bureau, and the Business Bureau said it should be handled by the Planning and Finance Department. It was pushed back and forth for several rounds, and no one handled it. Later, after the Secretariat contacted the Planning and Finance Department, it was considered that it should be handled by the Business Bureau. After it was sent to the Business Bureau, they still did not accept it, so they had to send the document to the director of the General Office, who instructed: "Please Vice Minister Zhang Kexia read and instruct." Vice Minister Zhang instructed: "I agree with the regulations of the Ministry of Forest Industry. Since it is a copy, it can be filed for reference." This document was then sent to the file cabinet. Wang Buyun, the director of the China Minerals Company of the Ministry of Foreign Trade, wrote a big-character poster with the title: "Layer upon Layer of Approval, Everyone Passes It On, the Section Clerk is in Trouble." This big-character poster criticized that in order to handle a telegram from Sichuan Province, the office of Minister Ye Jizhuang approved it to the bureau, the director approved it to the division, the director approved it to the section member, and the section member finally wrote according to Director Liu's instruction: "Extracted, and informed Director Chen of China Minerals Company, who will draft a reply on behalf of the ministry." The big-character poster stated: "Now that this telegram has been forwarded to me, I am still considering how to reply after reading it." It is unknown when this telegram will complete this long journey.

　　请看这些公文的命运
　　——严重的积压，没有结果的旅行
　　新华社记者　余志恒
    在中央国家机关里，每天都有成千上万的公文在那里川流不息地运转，从中央到地方，从这个部到那个部，从这个司、局、处、科到那个司、局、处、科，它传递着重要的方针、政策、指示、决定、请示和报告，它体现着我们国家政治生活中的一部分。但是，由于有些部门的领导人以官僚主义态度对待这些公文，造成严重的积压和公文旅行的现象，给工作带来了不应有的损失。在这次大鸣大放中，群众在大字报上对这种不良的现象进行了有力的揭露和严厉的批评。
    明日黄花
    从许多国家机关的大字报可以看出，由于一个文稿从起草到发出，要经过很多层次才出大门，因而使许多急事都成了明日黄花。冶金工业部建筑局大字报说，冶金部建筑局武汉冶金建筑总公司在1956年夏天曾给冶金部一件关于防暑措施的公文，请予批示。这个部的建筑局直到寒冬已经降临的11月才批下去，这时已不需防暑而需要防寒了。财政部一张题为“在工业司睡了一个半月的特急文件”的大字报说：为了解决1957年石绵严重不足，国家经济委员会在1957年6月27日以特急文件通知增加四川石绵矿投资若干万元。这个文件在7月1日到达财政部工业司便睡觉了，直到8月份四川省计委代表来北京开会，才查问到这个特急文件已压在工业司睡了一个半月的觉。由于严重的积压，为查询这件事，上下之间曾打过数次长途电话、写过公函，花费了不少人力物力不说，重要的是影响了石绵生产的迅速发展。建筑工程部的大字报说，1957年6月22日计划司、基建司、财务司等开会确定将联合加工厂的经济核算体制加以改变，以减少企业亏损和对外结算上的扯皮。但这个文稿从计划司送到基建司会签时，竟被压到10月24日，经查询才给发回来。由于时间拖得太久，结果给企业造成不应有的开支达九十七万多元。
    商业部计划局一个干部写的大字报说，他在1957年4月下旬起草了一个工作通报的文件，经层层上转到部长那里以后就没有下文了。一再催问，最后退回的文件上写着副部长批示的几个大字：“此文已压了很久，失去时效，不发。”签字日期是7月1日。写这张大字报的干部质问：为什么一个文稿经两个月之久，又没有听到部长在具体内容上提出任何修改的意见，竟出不了大门而变成“失去时效”呢？他要求部首长答复。司法部有七个干部联名写大字报批评法律解答工作中的拖拉现象。大字报说，以法令编纂司所经办的文件为例，在1956年处理的一百零七件文件中，一个月以内答复的仅占35.5％，三个月以内答复的占33.6％，其余都在三个月以外，个别还有积压达一年半才答复的。
    无人作主
    建筑工程部生产局的大字报说：中南四公司1956年12月请示竹筋混凝土空心楼板材料报废问题，文件到后，接办单位把文件压了半年没有答复就归档了。1957年5月，中南四公司来函催问，又才把这个文件从档案柜里取出来，但由于工作制度和责任制度不健全，技术司、财务司、生产局都认为不属于自己单位的任务，所以只好把文件退回办公厅重新批办。财政部两位副部长的两个秘书写了一张题为“一件积压将近四年的公文”的大字报，批评副部长们的推诿拖拉作风。大字报说，人民银行残破人民币和公债券的监销问题，1953年经前政务院财经委员会批示：“应由财政部门为主，派员监销”。但在执行中发生不少问题，远在1954年先后就曾有四十个省、市和省辖市财政部门提出了不少意见。但有关副部长没有很好研究、积极处理，虽然先后经过三位副部长看过，但未获解决。这三位副部长的批示是：金明副部长批：“这个问题扯了很久，一直未解决”。他认为“由财政部监察司监销是有些形式主义，但完全推开也似不太好，同时，银行也不同意”。他“要监察司再研究一下”。戎子和副部长认为：“这是立法手续问题，不便推脱，请胡副部长再考虑”。胡立教副部长表示同意监察司的意见，建议国务院明确规定财政部门不再派人参加监销，由银行自行销毁。并口头指示：“监察司再向戎副部长汇报一下”。至此以后再也没有过问了。几年来，有些省、市来函、来电请示，财政部迟迟不能作答，问题就这样拖下来了，直到最近才准备研究处理办法。
    没有结果的“旅行”
    城市建设部一张大字报说：1956年7月城市建设部收到公安部“关于爆炸物品管理的规则”公文，征求这个部的意见。办公厅批给保卫司，保卫司转给规划局，规划局压了二十天以后转给设计局，设计局压了八天送给公用局，公用局压了十四天以后退给办公厅，大家都在上面划了圈，没有提出任何意见，两个多月的旅行，最后的归宿是“存档”。林业部一张题为“一个公文的下场”的大字报说，4月10日收到森林工业部“关于增产三等造纸材、二等坑木、梢头木、粗枝桠和原木等木材产品可一律免纳育林费”的来文，当天送给计划财务司，这个司说应该叫经营局办，经营局又退回叫计划财务司办，计划财务司仍说该经营局办，经营局又说该计划财务司办，推来推去周转几个回合，没有人办，后来经秘书处与计划财务司联系，认为应由经营局处理，送经营局后，他们仍不接受，只好把这个文件送办公厅主任，主任批：“请张克侠副部长阅示”。张副部长批：“我同意森工部的规定，既是抄件，存查可也”。这个文件就被送到档案柜里去了。对外贸易部中国矿产公司处长王步云写了一张大字报，标题是：“层层批，个个转，科办员作了难”，这张大字报批评为处理四川省的一个电文，叶季壮部长办公室批给局，局长批给处，处长批给科员，科员最后根据刘处长的批语写道“已摘，并转告中国矿产公司谌处长，由公司代部拟稿”。大字报说：“现在这个电文虽然转给了我，我看后如何答复，还在考虑中”。不知道这个电文将旅行到何时才能了却这段漫长的旅程？
