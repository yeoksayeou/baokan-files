Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 26th - Soviet scientists have applied the principles of rocket technology to create a jet-powered thermal drilling device, and it is already being used successfully. This allows rockets to play a role not only in flying into the infinite cosmos but also in drilling into the earth's layers, opening up a second (ground-based) use for rockets. The main component of the thermal drilling device is a jet-powered burner made of steel tubes. Inside the burner, a mixture of liquid fuel (currently kerosene) and oxygen is burned, which can spray out a scorching hot airflow with a temperature exceeding 3,500 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 20 to 25 atmospheres. Under the action of this airflow, the rock quickly splits and breaks into small particles, which are ejected from the borehole. As the steel tube burner drills deep into the rock, a special device automatically guides it in the specified direction. The drilling speed can be controlled; drilling fast results in small holes, while drilling slowly results in large holes, and sometimes bag-shaped holes suitable for filling with explosives can be burned out. The metal shell of the jet burner is cooled by circulating water inside, and the liquid fuel, water, and oxygen it needs are supplied by a special device.

Thermal drilling is more economical, faster, and more efficient than mechanical drilling. For example, using a thermal drilling device to drill granite can reach 24 meters per hour, while drilling the same depth using mechanical drilling methods would take many days.

The Soviet Union has now produced various devices that use thermal drilling methods. These devices can be widely used in geological exploration, mines, construction engineering, and other work.

Xinhua News Agency, 25th - TASS Moscow reported: The famous Soviet scientist Ginzburg said that the explosion of supernovae can throw primordial cosmic particles into cosmic space. The galactic electronic cloud can be considered as the location of cosmic rays, and when there is a sufficient frequency of such explosions here, these particles can maintain a certain fixed density.

Ginzburg, a corresponding academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, recently published an article in "Komsomolskaya Pravda" introducing the theory of the origin of cosmic rays established by Soviet scientists and exploring a series of issues related to the study of cosmic rays. The scientist wrote that the results of studying cosmic radio radiation prove that there are "condensations" of fast electrons in individual locations in the universe, and therefore also "condensations" of other particles that make up cosmic rays. These locations are the outer shells of supernovae. The explosion of this type of star is a huge nuclear explosion, which sometimes causes the star's matter to scatter completely, creating gas clouds. In this case, supernovae can emit light equivalent to tens of billions of ordinary stars.

This spectacular phenomenon is rare. In the past thousand years, it has only been discovered three times in our star system: 1054, 1572, and 1604. The last star shone for half a year and then slowly went out. Chinese and Japanese chroniclers recorded this phenomenon in their historical records. They also recorded the location where this strange star shone. Now there is a "young" Crab Nebula at this location. This nebula is the remnant of the exploded star. After the star exploded, gaseous matter scattered at a speed of 1,000 kilometers per second. Now this nebula is the most powerful source of radio radiation. The theory of the origin of cosmic rays, established by Soviet physicists and astrophysicists in the past three or four years, is based on these facts.

    火箭能上天也能入地
    苏联制成喷气热力钻探装置
    宇宙线起源理论已由苏联学者创立
    新华社莫斯科26日电　苏联科学家应用火箭技术原理制成了一种喷气式热力钻探装置，并且已经成功地在使用。这使得火箭不但在飞入无穷的宇宙空间方面，而且在钻入地层方面发挥作用，开辟了火箭的第二个（地面上的）用途。热力钻探装置的主要构件是一种由钢制管子构成的喷气式燃烧器。燃烧器里面有液体燃料（目前使用煤油）和氧气的混合物在燃烧，它能喷出温度超过摄氏三千五百度、压力达二十至二十五大气压的赤热气流。在这种气流作用下，岩石很快地劈裂并碎成小粒，这些小粒由钻孔喷出。当钢管燃烧器向岩石深处钻入时，一种特制装置会自动地将它引到规定的方向。钻进速度可以控制，深入得快钻的孔小，深入得慢钻的孔大，有时可以烧出适于填入炸药的袋形洞。喷气式燃烧器的金属壳由里面的循环水来冷却，它所需要的液体燃料、水和氧气则由特制的装置来供应。
    热力钻探比机械钻探用钱省、速度快、效率高。例如，用热力钻探装置来钻探花岗岩，每小时可达二十四公尺，而用机械钻探方法钻同样深度则需要很多天才行。
    苏联现在已制成使用热力钻探法的各种装置。这些装置可广泛采用于地质勘探、矿井、建筑工程等项工作中。
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联著名科学家金兹堡说，超新星的爆发可以把原始宇宙粒子抛到宇宙空间里。银河系电子云可以被认为是宇宙线存在的地点，当这里有足够频率的这种爆发时，这些粒子可以保持某种固定的密度。
    苏联科学院通讯院士金兹堡最近在“共青团真理报”上发表了一篇文章，介绍苏联科学家创立的宇宙线起源的理论，并且探讨了一系列与研究宇宙线有关的问题。这位科学家写道，研究宇宙无线电辐射的结果证明，在宇宙的个别地点有快速电子“凝聚块”，因而也就有组成宇宙线的其他粒子的“凝聚块”。这些地点就是超新星的外壳。这种星的爆发就是巨大的原子核爆炸，这种爆炸有时会使这个星的物质完全飞散，造成气体云。在这种情况下，超新星可以发出相当数百亿个普通恒星所发出的光。
    这种奇观的现象是少见的。近千年来，我们这个恒星系中只发现了三次：1054年、1572年和1604年。最后一颗星亮了半年，然后慢慢地熄灭了。中国和日本编年史编纂者都在自己的史料中记载了这一现象。其中并且记载了这颗奇怪的星发光的地点。现在在这个地点有一个“年轻的”蟹状星云。这一星云就是爆炸的那颗星的残余。这颗星爆炸以后，气体物质以每秒一千公里的速度飞散开来。现在这一星云是最强大的无线电辐射源。最近三、四年中苏联物理学家和天体物理学家创立的宇宙线起源理论就是以这些事实为根据的。
