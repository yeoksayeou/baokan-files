    Making Furniture
    The New Year is approaching. Every parent wants to prepare some interesting gifts for their children during this joyous time.
    Today, we are here to introduce how to make toys using paper boxes that contain snow cream (or ink). These small sofas and small cabinets look fun and are easy to make. If you take the children to work together to make some small furniture as a New Year's gift for them, they will be very happy.

    做家具
    新年就要到来了。每一位做父母的总想在这个欢乐的日子里，为孩子们准备些有意思的礼物。
    今天我们在这里给大家介绍的，是利用装雪花膏（或墨水）的纸盒子做玩具。这种小沙发、小柜子，看上去很好玩，做起来也很简单。如果领着孩子们一起动手，做几件小家具，作为送给他们的新年礼物，他们一定非常高兴。
