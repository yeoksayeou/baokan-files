Xinhua News Agency, December 5th. The Chairman of the Burmese Trade Union Congress, Tekin Lun, who was invited to attend the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, today gave a statement he and the General Secretary of the Burmese Trade Union Congress, Tekin Qing Su, issued in support of the Indonesian people's struggle to liberate West Irian to Yono, the General Secretary of the All-Indonesia Central Trade Union Federation, who is in Beijing attending the "Eighth National Congress" of trade unions, asking him to forward it to the Chairman of the Indonesian Action Committee for the Liberation of West Irian.

The statement said, on behalf of the Burmese working people, we express our deep sympathy and unreserved support to you and, through you, to all the Indonesian people who are waging a historically significant struggle for the liberation of West Irian. We have no doubt that West Irian is an integral part of Indonesia, and we join you in demanding the unconditional return of West Irian to Indonesia as soon as possible.

The statement said that the Dutch imperialists' conspiracy over West Irian not only threatens the independence and security of Indonesia, but also threatens peace in Asia and other parts of the world.

The statement said that people all over the world were outraged to hear the news of the recent assassination attempt on your national leader, President Sukarno, and therefore you have once again received the support of the world's peaceful and democratic forces for your just struggle.
