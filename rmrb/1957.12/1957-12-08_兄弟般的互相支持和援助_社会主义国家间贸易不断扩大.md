　　Xinhua News Agency, 7th December: According to a TASS report, trade between the Soviet Union and various socialist countries is expanding year by year.
　　In 1956, the People's Republic of China ranked first in the Soviet Union's trade with socialist countries and in its overall foreign trade. The German Democratic Republic was second, Czechoslovakia was third, and Poland was fourth. In that year, these four countries accounted for more than half of the Soviet Union's total foreign trade, and the entire socialist camp accounted for about 76% of the Soviet Union's total foreign trade.
　　Trade between the Soviet Union and China is developing year by year. Last year, the trade volume between the Soviet Union and China accounted for 20.5% of the Soviet Union's total foreign trade. From 1953 to 1956, the trade volume between the Soviet Union and China increased by almost 54%. At the same time, the structure of goods supplied by the Soviet Union to China has also changed significantly. In 1956, the proportion of complete sets of equipment in the total value of goods exported from the Soviet Union to China increased from 7.3% in 1952 to 29.6%.
　　In 1956, the trade volume between the Soviet Union and European socialist countries increased to 14.8 billion rubles, almost five times more than in 1946. Among them, the trade volume between the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union accounted for more than one-fifth of the Soviet Union's trade with various socialist countries. Both the German Democratic Republic and Czechoslovakia are major countries supplying machinery and equipment to the Soviet Union. Last year, about 55% of all equipment imported by the Soviet Union from abroad was imported from these two countries.
　　Compared with 1950, the trade volume between the Soviet Union and seven countries, including Poland, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, Albania, North Korea, and Mongolia, has increased significantly. The trade relations between the Soviet Union and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have also expanded.
　　Trade with the Soviet Union also occupies a leading position in the foreign trade of socialist countries. In China's foreign trade volume, the Soviet Union accounts for more than 53%; in Poland's foreign trade volume, the Soviet Union accounts for 27.5%; in Czechoslovakia's foreign trade volume, the Soviet Union accounts for nearly 32%; in the German Democratic Republic's foreign trade volume, the Soviet Union accounts for 41%; and in the total foreign trade volume of Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania, the Soviet Union accounts for 48%, 44%, and more than 40%, respectively. Before the Second World War, the Soviet Union accounted for only 1% of the total foreign trade volume of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria.

　　社会主义国家间贸易不断扩大
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联同各社会主义国家的贸易年年在不断扩大。
    1956年，在苏联对社会主义国家贸易和整个对外贸易中占第一位的是中华人民共和国，第二位是德意志民主共和国，第三位是捷克斯洛伐克，第四位是波兰。这一年，总计这四个国家占苏联对外贸易总额的一半以上，整个社会主义阵营国家在苏联对外贸易总额中所占的比重约为76％。
    苏联同中国的贸易年年都在发展。去年，苏中贸易额已经占苏联对外贸易总额的20.5％。从1953年到1956年，苏中贸易额差不多增加了54％。同时，苏联供应给中国的商品结构也大大改变了。1956年，在苏联向中国输出的商品总额中，全套设备供应的比重已经从1952年的7.3％增加到29.6％。
    1956年，苏联同欧洲各社会主义国家的贸易额已经增加到一百四十八亿卢布，几乎比1946年增加了五倍。其中，德意志民主共和国和苏联两国之间的贸易额占苏联同各社会主义国家的贸易额的五分之一强，它和捷克斯洛伐克都是供应苏联机器设备的主要国家。去年，苏联从国外进口的全部设备中约有55％是由这两个国家进口的。
    同1950年比较，苏联同波兰、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚、朝鲜、蒙古等七个国家的贸易额大大地增长了，苏联同越南民主共和国的贸易关系也扩大了。
    对苏贸易在社会主义国家的对外贸易中也占首要地位。在中国的对外贸易额中，苏联所占的比重是53％强；在波兰的对外贸易额中，苏联的比重是27.5％；在捷克斯洛伐克的对外贸易额中，苏联占将近32％；在德意志民主共和国的对外贸易额中，苏联占41％；在罗马尼亚、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚的对外贸易总额中，苏联所占的比重分别是48％、44％和40％强。而在第二次世界大战以前，苏联在波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚和保加利亚的对外贸易总额中所占的比重仅为1％。
