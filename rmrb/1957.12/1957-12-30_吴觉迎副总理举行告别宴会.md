Xinhua News Agency, December 29th – Burmese Federal Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein and his wife held a banquet tonight to bid farewell to China's state and government leaders.

Premier Zhou Enlai attended the banquet tonight.

Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein said at the banquet that the Burmese friendly economic delegation's visit to China has successfully completed its mission of strengthening friendly relations between the two countries and is of great benefit to the development of economic exchanges between the two countries. He said that the delegation has not only made new friends in China but also renewed old friendships, further consolidating the friendly relations between the two countries and gaining new strength.

Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein repeatedly expressed his gratitude to Premier Zhou Enlai and other state leaders of China. He said that the delegation was given the opportunity to visit and inspect China without any reservations. There is an old Chinese saying, "Seeing once is better than hearing a hundred times." Now we have not only "seen once" but "seen a hundred times." The delegation traveled no less than 8,000 kilometers in China, visiting many places in Northeast, East China, and Northwest China, and everywhere they were warmly welcomed and kindly received. In his speech, he also mentioned the achievements China has made in developing industry, especially in developing heavy industry, and pointed out that these achievements were obtained in the short few years after China's liberation, which made the delegation particularly excited.

Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein said that, in all respects, Myanmar and China are close neighbors that are as closely related as lips and teeth. Like two neighboring households, the people living on both sides have the same bloodline. The friendship between the two countries has existed for a long time in history and is now increasingly consolidated on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the spirit of the Bandung Conference. He said that while promoting friendship between the two countries, both sides should work together to develop economic exchanges that are mutually beneficial to the two countries.

Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein also asked the ambassadors of Czechoslovakia, Poland, the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Romania, and Mongolia to China, who attended tonight's banquet, to convey his gratitude to the state leaders and people of these countries, because the delegation he led had received a warm welcome and reception when visiting these countries.

Premier Zhou Enlai thanked Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein for his praise of China's construction situation, saying that he would take this praise as an encouragement to the Chinese people, and hoped that when Burmese friends visit China again, they would give more guidance to China's work in various fields.

Premier Zhou Enlai said that the friendly relations between China and Myanmar are not only manifested in the long-term friendly exchanges in history, but especially now, are more closely manifested on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Premier Zhou said that China faces the sea to the east, and this road for exchanges with countries around the world has been artificially cut off by American imperialism. Now, New China can only communicate with European countries, Asian and African countries, and even countries around the world from the north through Ulaanbaatar and Moscow, and from the southwest through Yangon and New Delhi. Therefore, rather than saying that China has received many Burmese friends, it is better to say that the Burmese hosts in Yangon have received more Chinese guests. Premier Zhou said, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Burmese government and people for giving the Chinese people great convenience, enabling them to have friendly exchanges with Asian and African countries through the road of Yangon. Premier Zhou finally wished that the friendship between China and Myanmar would be like "evergreen mountains and ever-flowing rivers." At the end of his speech, he shouted in Burmese, "Long live China-Myanmar friendship" and "Long live the Paukphaw friendship between China and Myanmar."

Bulgarian Ambassador to China, Mr. ? Galkov, on behalf of the ambassadors of various countries attending the banquet, wished for the development of friendship between all countries and the consolidation of world peace.

    吴觉迎副总理举行告别宴会
    据新华社29日讯　缅甸联邦副总理吴觉迎和夫人今晚举行宴会，向我国国家和政府领导人告别。
    周恩来总理出席了今晚的宴会。
    吴觉迎副总理在宴会上说，缅甸友好经济考察团这次访问中国，圆满地完成了加强两国友好关系的任务，并且对发展两国的经济来往有莫大的好处。他说，代表团这次在中国既结识了新朋友，又同老朋友叙旧而更形亲密，这就使两国的友好关系进一步巩固，获得了新的力量。
    吴觉迎副总理在宴会上一再表示对周恩来总理和我国其他国家领导人的谢意。他说，代表团这次在中国得到了毫无保留地让他们任意参观和任意考察的机会。中国有句老话“百闻不如一见”，现在我们已不止“一见”，而是“百见”了。代表团在中国旅行了不下八千公里，参观访问了东北、华东和西北的许多地方，到处都受到热情的欢迎和亲切的招待。他在讲话中还提到中国在发展工业，特别是在发展重工业方面所取得的成就，并且指出这些成就都是在中国解放后的短短几年中获得的，因而使代表团感到特别兴奋。
    吴觉迎副总理说，从各方面来看，缅中两国是唇齿相连、休戚相关的近邦。犹如相互毗邻的两户人家，两边居住的人民有着相同的血统。两国的友谊在历史上就长期存在，目前更在和平共处五项原则和万隆会议精神的基础上日益巩固。他说，在促进两国友好的同时，双方要为发展对两国互利的经济来往而共同努力。
    吴觉迎副总理还请出席今晚宴会的捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、苏联、保加利亚、罗马尼亚和蒙古驻中国的使节，转致对这些国家的国家领导人和人民的谢意，因为他所率领的代表团在这些国家访问时曾受到热情的欢迎和接待。
    周恩来总理在宴会上感谢吴觉迎副总理对中国建设情况的称赞，表示要把这种称赞当作对中国人民的一种鼓励，并且希望缅甸朋友们再到中国访问时，能对中国各方面的工作给予更多的指教。
    周恩来总理说，中缅两国的友好关系不仅表现在历史上有着长期的友好往来，特别是现在，在和平共处五项原则的基础上表现得更加密切。周总理说，中国的东方面临大海，这条与世界各国来往的道路被美帝国主义人为地隔断了。现在，新中国只有从北部通过乌兰巴托、莫斯科，从西南通过仰光、新德里，才能同欧洲国家、亚非国家以至世界各国来往。因此与其说中国接待了许多缅甸友人，不如说在仰光的缅甸主人接待了更多的中国客人。周总理说，我愿借此机会，感谢缅甸政府和人民给了中国人民极大的方便，使他们能够通过仰光这条道路同亚非各国友好来往。周总理最后祝中缅两国友谊有如“青山不老，绿水长流”。他在结束讲话时，用缅甸话高呼“中缅友好万岁”和“中缅两国的胞波友谊万岁”。
    保加利亚驻中国大使?加尔科夫代表出席宴会的各国使节在宴会上祝各国友好的发展和世界和平的巩固。
