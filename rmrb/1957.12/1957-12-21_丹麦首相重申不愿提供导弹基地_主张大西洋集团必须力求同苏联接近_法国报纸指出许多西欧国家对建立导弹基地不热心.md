Xinhua News Agency, December 20th. TASS, Copenhagen, December 19th: The Danish "Commercial Daily" published a statement by Danish Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Hansen to the Associated Press. Hansen said that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization must strive for closer relations with the Soviet Union. Member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should take "very clear steps to continue negotiations." Hansen reiterated that Denmark is unwilling to set up intermediate-range rocket launch sites on its territory. Hansen emphasized, "We believe that for us, accepting such weapons would be incorrect."

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 20th: French newspapers, commenting on the final communique of the North Atlantic Group's summit that ended on the 19th, emphasized that although the meeting reached a principled agreement on the establishment of missile bases after the United States exerted great pressure on European countries, Western European countries are not enthusiastic about this agreement.

"Le Monde" commented: In the view of some countries, the agreement of European countries in the North Atlantic Group to set up intermediate-range ballistic missile launch pads on their territory does not mean that every European country in the North Atlantic Group individually accepts this obligation. Everyone seems to tend to think that their neighbors are more suitable for undertaking this new responsibility. West German Defense Minister Strauss explained that his country is too close to future targets and therefore cannot set up long-range missiles on its territory.

"Paris Daily" wrote that the Dutch representatives are very enthusiastic about rockets, but they say in private that their country's "soil is too soft" and not suitable for building rocket bases. Therefore, rocket bases are best built in... Britain or France. Representatives from Belgium and West Germany also pointed out the "advantages" of deploying rocket bases in the French Alps. "Le Parisien Libéré" wrote indignantly: "It's strange that Belgium and Germany (West Germany) actually want to control French territory, while they themselves are afraid of becoming imaginary targets and dare not accept missiles."

    丹麦首相重申不愿提供导弹基地
    主张大西洋集团必须力求同苏联接近
    法国报纸指出许多西欧国家对建立导弹基地不热心
    新华社20日讯  塔斯社哥本哈根19日讯：丹麦“商报”登载了丹麦首相兼外交大臣汉森向美联社记者发表的谈话。汉森说，北大西洋公约组织必须力求同苏联接近。北大西洋公约组织成员国应当采取“十分明确的步骤来继续举行谈判”。汉森重申，丹麦不愿意在本国领土上设置中程火箭发射场。汉森强调指出，“我们认为，对我们来说，接受这种武器将是不正确的。”
    据新华社巴黎20日电  法国报纸在评论19日结束的北大西洋集团最高级会议的最后公报时强调指出，会议虽然在美国对欧洲国家施加很大压力以后，在建立导弹基地的问题上达成了原则性的协议，但是西欧各国对于这个协议并不热心。
    “世界报”的评论说：在某些国家看来，北大西洋集团欧洲国家同意在它们的领土上设置中程弹道导弹发射台，这并不意味着北大西洋集团的每一个欧洲国家都分别接受了承担这一义务。大家似乎都倾向于认为自己的邻国比较适宜于承担这种新的责任。西德国防部长施特劳斯解释说：他的国家是过于靠近未来的目标了，因而不能在国土上设置长距离导弹。
    “巴黎日报”写道，荷兰代表对火箭非常热心，但是，他们私下里说，他们国家的“土壤过于松软”，不适合建立火箭基地，因此，火箭基地最好还是建立在……英国或法国。比利时和西德的代表也指出在法国的阿尔卑斯山地区部署火箭基地的“优点”。“解放了的巴黎人报”愤慨地写道：“真是奇怪，比利时和德国（西德）竟然想要支配法国的领土，而它们自己却因为害怕成为想像中的靶子而不敢接受导弹”。（附图片）
