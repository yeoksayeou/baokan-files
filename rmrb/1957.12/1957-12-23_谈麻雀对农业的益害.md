On the Benefits and Harms of Sparrows to Agriculture
Researcher, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Zheng Zuoxin

Since the launch of the Four Pests Elimination Campaign, there have been disputes about the benefits and harms of sparrows and the extent of their harm because people's opinions differed. The focus of the debate is what sparrows eat in various types of regions and throughout their annual life cycle.

In recent years (1953 to 1956), ornithological researchers from the Institute of Zoology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in collaboration with the Entomology Teaching and Research Group of Hebei Agricultural College, collected 504 sparrows in fruit-growing areas and farmland in Changli County, Hebei Province, and 344 sparrows in farmland near Beijing in 1955 and 1956, totaling 848. Specimens were collected in all months of the year. By dissecting the sparrows' stomachs and crops, it was found that sparrows in this type of area eat the following five items: 1. Crops, including rice, millet, sorghum, wheat, mung beans, sesame, melons, etc.; 2. Insects, such as locusts, scarabs, wireworms, ladybugs, caterpillars, etc.; 3. Weed seeds, such as Kochia scoparia, quinoa, foxtail grass, etc., of many kinds; 4. Plants with no special economic relationship, including seeds of wild plants (excluding weeds), mulberries, etc.; 5. Others, including spiders, snails, etc.

Now, regarding each food item, the percentage of the total annual amount eaten by the sparrows we dissected is calculated as follows:

Food Category 	Percentage of Food Weight (Annual)
1. Crops 	52.22%
2. Insects 	9.46%
3. Weed Seeds 	25.94%
4. Plants with No Benefit or Harm 	10.87%
5. Other 	0.87%

From the above statistics, it can be seen that crops account for 52.22% of the sparrows' food throughout the year, exceeding the sum of all other foods. Sparrows eat crops almost every month, and in most of the time (nine months), the crops they eat exceed 50% of their food intake at that time, especially during the autumn crop ripening period, when crops account for more than 70% of their food intake.

Sparrows also eat weed seeds in all months of the year, but weed seeds account for only 25.94% of their total annual food intake, and they only eat more in winter. Weeds produce a very large number of seeds, which are difficult to count. Therefore, the benefit of sparrows eating some weed seeds to agricultural production is not significant, and it is not of great significance in eliminating weeds.

The animal food eaten by sparrows is mainly insects, accounting for 9.64% of the total annual food intake. Although the quantity is not large, most of the insects eaten are pests, and they are eaten during the summer breeding season of the pests, especially in June, when the insects eaten account for more than half of the food intake in June, so sparrows have considerable benefits during this period. Sparrow chicks almost entirely eat insects (accounting for 94.92% of the total food intake), and most of them are pests.

From the above analysis, it can be seen that sparrows are of little benefit to crops, but the harm is great. The stage when sparrows consume the most crops is exactly when crops ripen in this area. For example, in Changli County, Hebei Province, winter wheat ripens in late June, and spring wheat ripens in July, and sparrows concentrate on harming wheat during this period. For example, millet ripens in August, and sorghum is harvested in August and September, and sparrows then turn to harm these two crops. Especially when grains are ripe but not yet harvested, sparrows flock to peck at the ears, not only swallowing the grains, but also knocking many mature crop seeds to the ground due to pecking, which is very wasteful. According to a survey by the "Georgi" State Farm in the Soviet Union, on 400 hectares of winter wheat land, sparrows reduced the yield from 22 quintals per hectare to 12 quintals. In one year, this farm lost nearly 400 tons of wheat. Although no scientific statistics have been done on this issue in China, the serious harm caused by sparrows to crops is also similar in the double-cropping or triple-cropping rice areas in the south.

After the harvest period, that is, in the overwintering season, sparrows still feed on grains; especially during seed drying, threshing, drying grounds, and in poultry and livestock farms and open-air grain storage stacks, the noise and harm of sparrows are well known. According to our observations in the suburbs of Beijing, sparrows mainly forage in rice straw piles with grains on the threshing floor after the harvest. During the overwintering season, sparrows mostly look for food near farmhouses, especially near grain storage houses and drying grounds, and along roadsides and field ridges in the fields. At present, most agricultural areas do not have complete warehouse facilities, and sparrows are also harmful to grain storage places. It should be particularly pointed out that sparrows often increase with the expansion of cultivated land because they are fond of grains, and they often spread everywhere with human economic activities. This is an ecological feature that distinguishes sparrows from other small birds.

As for the diet of sparrows in cities and forest areas, it is still worth further study. The National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) points out that "killing sparrows is to protect crops, and sparrows in cities and forest areas can be spared." This instruction is correct. According to my recent inspections in the Soviet Union and East Germany, I know that they have the same understanding and views on the sparrow issue. In the southern Soviet Union and East Germany, relevant research institutions are also studying how to control sparrows and eliminate their harm in agricultural areas.

It is advisable to catch and kill sparrows in autumn and winter. Sparrows often forage in groups in winter, making it easier and more effective to catch and kill them. When sparrows breed in spring and summer, if their nests and eggs are destroyed, they will continue to build nests and lay eggs. Therefore, after discovering a sparrow's nest, it is better to let it lay eggs and raise chicks, and wait until the chicks are fed a little larger and before they fly away from the nest, and then kill them all at once. In this way, while preventing and controlling sparrow damage, we can also take advantage of the benefits of sparrows eating insects during the breeding season.

When catching and killing sparrows, it is not advisable to indiscriminately kill all small birds. We should pay attention to protecting beneficial birds, especially many insect-eating small birds that are similar in appearance to sparrows, such as tits (called "zizibo" in the north and "baimianzhi" in the south), flycatchers (i.e., flycatchers, or called "big-eyed mouths," etc.), and warblers (i.e., willow warblers, or called "weizi").

    谈麻雀对农业的益害
    中国科学院动物研究所研究员  郑作新
    自从开展除四害运动以来，对于麻雀的益害问题和它的为害程度究竟怎样，曾经一度因为大家的看法有所不同，引起争论。争论的焦点，就是麻雀在各种类型的地区内，以及在它的全年生活过程中，究竟吃的是什么？
    近几年来（1953到1956年），科学院动物研究所鸟类学研究人员协同河北农学院昆虫学教研组人员，曾经在河北省昌黎县的果区、农地等处，采得五百零四只麻雀，又在1955到1956年在北京近郊的农田一带采得三百四十四只，共计八百四十八只。全年各月份都采到标本。由剖验雀胃和嗉囊，知道麻雀在这一类型地区，吃的东西可分为下列五项：一、农作物，包括稻子、谷子、高粱、小麦、绿豆、芝麻、瓜类等；二、昆虫，如蝗虫、金龟子、金针虫、瓢虫、毛虫等；三、杂草种子，如地肤、藜、狗尾草等，种类很多；四、没有特殊经济关系的植物，包括野生植物（杂草除外）的种子、桑葚等；五、其它，包括蜘蛛、蜗牛等。
    现在就各项食物，把我们剖验的麻雀所吃的分量，核算全年的百分比如下表：
    食物类别           食物分量的百分比（全年）
    ⒈农作物            52.22％
    ⒉昆虫              9.46％
    ⒊杂草种子          25.94％
    ⒋无益害关系的植物  10.87％
    ⒌其  它            0.87％
    由上面的统计，可以看出麻雀的食物中农作物占了全年食量的52.22％，超过其它一切食物的总和。麻雀几乎在各月中都吃了农作物，而且在大部分时间（九个月）吃的农作物都超过当时食量的50％，尤其在秋季作物成熟期间，它的食量中农作物达到70％以上。
    麻雀在全年各月中也都吃杂草种子，但是在它的全年食量中，所吃的杂草种子仅占25.94％，只在冬季吃得比较多。杂草所产生的种子非常多，难以数计；所以，麻雀吃掉一些杂草种子，对农业生产的益处并不显著，在消灭杂草这一方面意义不大。
    麻雀所吃的动物性东西以昆虫为主，在全年食物总量中占9.64％，虽然数量不多，因为所吃的昆虫大多数是害虫，而且吃的时候正是害虫夏季繁殖期间，特别是在6月，所吃的昆虫占6月食量的一半以上，所以麻雀在这一期间有相当益处。麻雀幼鸟几乎完全吃昆虫（占总食量的94.92％），而且多半是害虫。
    从上面的分析，可以看到麻雀对农作物益处不大，而害处却很大。麻雀取食农作物最多的阶段，恰恰就在这一带地区农作物成熟的时期。例如在河北省昌黎县，冬小麦在6月下旬成熟，春小麦在7月成熟，而麻雀也在这期间集中为害小麦。又如谷子在8月成熟，高粱在8、9月间收成，麻雀就在这期间转而为害这两种作物。特别是在谷物成熟而还没有收割的时候，麻雀集群地在穗头上啄食，不但吞吃了谷物，而且由于啄食，把许多成熟的作物种子弹落地上，糟蹋得很厉害。据苏联“格奥尔吉”国营农场的调查，在四百顷的冬小麦地上，麻雀使每公顷上的产量由二十二公担降到了十二公担。一年内，这个农场损失了将近四百吨小麦。国内对这个问题虽然没有做过科学统计，但是在南方一年两熟或者三熟稻作区，麻雀对农作物为害的严重，也有类似的情况。
    在收获期以后，就是在越冬季节，麻雀仍然取食粮物；特别是在晒种、打场、晒场等期间，以及在家禽、家畜的饲养场和露天储粮的囤垛等地方，麻雀的嚷扰和害处，是人们都知道的。根据我们在北京近郊的观察，麻雀在收获以后主要在晒谷场上带谷粒的稻草堆中觅食。到越冬季节，麻雀大都在农舍，特别是在贮粮房屋和晒场的附近，以及在田野的路旁、田埂等处寻找食物。目前，一般农区并没有完善的仓库设备，麻雀对贮粮场所也是有害处的。应该特别指出，麻雀因为嗜食谷物，所以常常随着耕地的扩大而增加，并且往往随着人类的经济活动而到处分布。这是麻雀和其他小鸟在生态上不同的一种特征。
    至于麻雀在城市里以及林区等处的食性究竟怎样，还值得进一步的研究。全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）指出“打麻雀是为了保护庄稼，在城市里和林区的麻雀，可以不要消灭”。这项指示是正确的。据最近我在苏联和民主德国的考察，知道他们对麻雀问题也有同样的了解和看法。在苏联和民主德国的南部，有关的研究机构也正在研究如何在农作区控制麻雀、消灭它们的为害。
    捕打麻雀以在秋、冬季节进行为宜。麻雀在冬季因为常常结群觅食，捕打比较容易奏效。麻雀在春夏间繁殖的时候，若毁掉它的巢和卵，还会继续营巢产卵，所以在发现雀巢后，倒不如任它产卵育雏，等到幼鸟喂养稍大，在没有起飞离窝以前，一齐予以扑灭。这样，在防除雀害的同时，还可以利用麻雀在育雏期中吃虫的益处。
    在捕打麻雀的时候，不宜对所有小鸟乱打，应该注意保护益鸟，特别是许多和麻雀形色相似的吃虫小鸟，如山雀（北方叫吇吇伯，南方叫白面只）、鹟（音翁，即捕蝇鸟，或称大眼嘴儿等）、莺（即柳串儿，或称苇?子）等。
