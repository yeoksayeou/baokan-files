Where is the "Strength"?

The American ruling clique has been frightened by the proposals of some Western European countries to negotiate with the Soviet Union. The "New York Herald Tribune," in an editorial dispatched from Paris and clearly inspired by the American delegation, vehemently denounced the Western European countries. The editorial rebuked the Western European countries for "veering with the wind," their actions being "despicable" and "at the expense of someone else." In short, the Western European countries have greatly annoyed their overlord this time.

In addition to the vehement denunciation, the "New York Herald Tribune" admonished the Western European countries to negotiate "from a position of strength, not from a position of weakness." This is tantamount to admitting that the United States and its partners are now in a "weak" rather than a "strong" position.

Since the "New York Herald Tribune" cannot produce America's "strength" and yet demands that its allies negotiate from a "position of strength," this kind of admonition will certainly not convince its allies. The fact that the United States cannot subdue its allies with "strength" but only with vehement denunciations clearly illustrates the dead end to which America's policy of "position of strength" has reached.

### “实力”何在？

    “实力”何在？
    美国统治集团被一些西欧国家要求同苏联谈判的主张吓慌了。“纽约先驱论坛报”在一篇从巴黎发出而且显然是出于美国代表团的授意的社论中，对西欧国家破口大骂。这篇社论责骂西欧国家是“看风转舵”，它们的作法是“卑鄙的”，是“在牺牲别的什么人”。总之，西欧国家这次是大大地惹恼了它们的盟主。
    在大骂之余，“纽约先驱论坛报”训诫西欧国家说：要“凭借实力地位而不要凭借孱弱地位”来谈判。这无异是承认美国和它的伙伴们现在是处于“孱弱”的而不是“实力”的地位。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”既然拿不出美国的“实力”来，而又要美国的盟国们必须凭借“实力地位”来谈判，这种训诫当然不会使它的盟国心服的。美国不能以“实力”，而只能以破口大骂来制服它的盟国，这清楚地说明了美国的“实力地位”政策已到了何等穷途末路的地步了。
