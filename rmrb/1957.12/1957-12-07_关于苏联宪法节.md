　　About the Soviet Constitution Day
　　Question: December 5th is "Soviet Constitution Day." How was this established?
　　Answer: On December 5, 1936, the Extraordinary Eighth Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union adopted the new Constitution of the Soviet Union. Therefore, every December 5th has become a traditional festival for the Soviet people.
　　Question: What are the differences between the new Soviet Constitution passed in 1936 and the first Soviet Constitution passed in 1924?
　　Answer: The 1924 Soviet Constitution reflected the achievements of the victory of the October Revolution and the fact that power had been transferred to the hands of the workers; the new 1936 Constitution reflected the fact that the Soviet Union was building a socialist society and gradually transitioning to a communist society, and legally consolidated the various achievements of the Soviet people from 1924 to 1936.
　　Question: What are the characteristics of the Soviet Constitution?
　　Answer: The Soviet Constitution is the world's first truly democratic and socialist constitution. This constitution uses extremely simple language to explain the fact that socialism and the most thorough democratic system have been victorious in the Soviet Union. It not only encourages the Soviet people to continue their unremitting struggle to realize the beautiful society of communism, but also points out the direction for the oppressed people of the world to strive for peace, freedom, and a happy life. Therefore, the new Soviet Constitution is a document of great historical and international significance.
　　Article 1 of the Soviet Constitution states: "The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is a socialist state of workers and peasants." The socialist public ownership system is clearly recorded in the constitutional provisions.
　　Article 3 of the Constitution states: "All power in the Soviet Union belongs to the urban and rural workers, and is exercised by the Soviets of Workers' Deputies." The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union is the highest state power organ of the Soviet Union. The Supreme Soviet is composed of the Council of Nationalities and the Council of the Union, which are both chambers with equal rights. The Council of the Union represents the common interests of all citizens of the Soviet Union; the Council of Nationalities represents the special interests of all ethnic groups. The Soviet of Workers' Deputies is the political foundation of the Soviet Union. With this democratic grass-roots political organization, the working people can actively play the role of masters in managing state affairs.
　　The new constitution guarantees the true and thorough realization of socialist democracy and freedom. It stipulates that all citizens of the Soviet Union enjoy: the right to vote; the right to work; the right to education; the right to material security in old age, illness, or loss of working capacity; and women enjoy equal rights with men in all aspects of life. The equal rights of Soviet citizens regardless of nationality or race, and the unbreakable friendship of all ethnic groups are all specifically written into the new constitution.
　　The new constitution guarantees freedom of conscience for Soviet citizens. The law guarantees Soviet citizens freedom of speech, publication, assembly, procession and demonstration.
　　Question: What are the differences between the Soviet Constitution and capitalist constitutions?
　　Answer: The Soviet Constitution takes the fact that socialism has been victorious in the Soviet Union as its starting point and is based on the socialist public ownership system. Capitalist constitutions take the belief that the capitalist system will exist "forever" as their starting point and are based on capitalist private ownership. The Soviet Constitution not only defines the rights of citizens, but also effectively provides material guarantees to realize these rights. Capitalist constitutions are limited to formally defining the rights of citizens, but cannot guarantee the realization of these rights. (Liu)

### 关于苏联宪法节

　　关于苏联宪法节
    问：12月5日是“苏联宪法节”，这是怎样规定的？
    答：1936年12月5日，非常第八次苏联苏维埃代表大会通过了苏联的新宪法。因此，每逢12月5日便成了苏联人民的传统节日。
    问：1936年通过的苏联新宪法和1924年通过的苏联第一部宪法有什么不同？
    答：1924年的苏联宪法是反映了十月革命胜利的成果，政权转入劳动者手中的事实；1936年的新宪法则是反映了苏联在建设社会主义社会和逐渐过渡到共产主义社会的事实，并且从法律上巩固了苏联人民1924年到1936年间所取得的各种成就。
    问：苏联宪法有什么特点？
    答：苏联宪法是全世界第一部真正民主的、社会主义的宪法。这部宪法用极简明的词句，说明了社会主义和最彻底的民主制度在苏联已获得胜利的事实。它不仅鼓舞苏联人民为实现共产主义的美好社会而继续进行不懈的斗争，并且向全世界被压迫人民指出争取和平、自由和幸福生活的方向。因此，苏联新宪法是一个具有伟大历史意义和国际意义的文件。
    苏联宪法第一条说：“苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟为工农社会主义国家。”社会主义公有制度明确地被记载在宪法条文里。
    宪法第三条说：“苏联全部政权属于城乡劳动者，由劳动者代表苏维埃实现之。”苏联最高苏维埃是苏联最高的国家政权机关。最高苏维埃由民族院和联盟院组成，他们都是有平等权利的议院。联盟院代表苏联全体公民的共同利益；民族院代表各族人民的特殊利益。苏联劳动者代表苏维埃是苏联的政治基础。劳动人民有了这种民主的基层的政权组织，就可以积极地发挥管理国家大事的主人翁作用。
    新宪法保证了社会主义民主、自由的真正、彻底的实现。它规定苏联全体公民享有：选举权；劳动权；教育权；在年老、患病、或丧失劳动力时的物质保证权；妇女在生活各方面都与男子享有平等的权利。苏联公民不分民族和种族的平等权利、各族人民的牢不可破的友谊都具体地写在新宪法里。
    新宪法保证了苏联公民的信仰自由。法律保证苏联公民享有言论、出版、集会、游行及示威自由。
    问：苏联宪法和资本主义宪法的不同点是什么？
    答：苏联宪法是以社会主义在苏联已获得胜利的事实为出发点，以社会主义公有制为基础。资本主义宪法是以资本主义制度“永远”存在的信念为出发点，以资本主义私有制为基础。苏联宪法不仅确定公民的权利，并且切实地给以物质保证，以实现这些权利。资本主义宪法只限于形式上确定公民的权利，而不能保证这些权利的实现。（刘）
