In the Shaanxi Province, 6,294 agricultural cooperatives in the Hanzhong and Ankang special districts and 26 counties (cities) including Xi'an and Heyang, have successively started a comprehensive rectification campaign since late November. Counties in the northern Shaanxi and Shangluo special districts, as well as parts of Guanzhong counties, are currently being mobilized and arranged, and cadres are being trained. It is expected that they will be fully launched around the end of December.

At present, in areas where rectification has begun, most cooperatives are still in the stage of publicity and mobilization, while others have already started large-scale airing of views and criticisms. Cooperatives that started earlier and progressed faster have completed the airing of views and are now concentrating on rectification.

In order to guide the rural rectification work, each county has generally established a rural rectification office, and a large number of cadres have been transferred to participate in rural rectification. More than 11,000 full-time cadres have participated in the more than 6,000 cooperatives that have already started. Each cooperative generally has an average of one to three cadres. In addition, various counties have trained a large number of cooperative cadres. Counties in the Hanzhong special district have trained more than 4,600 people, and Xunyang County in the Ankang special district alone has trained more than 1,300 people. After training, the ideological level of these cadres has generally improved, which will play a significant role in carrying out rural rectification. The steps of rectification work in various places are generally divided into four stages: large-scale airing of views and criticisms, rectifying the organization and improving work, carrying out large-scale debates, and systematic summary. The time is generally around fifty days. Some counties are conducting the first batch of rectification mostly in third-class cooperatives, which have many problems and heavy tasks, and plan to use more than two months.

In order to closely integrate rectification with winter production, some cooperatives produce during the day and rectify at night; some study production and rectification in a unified manner, arrange them separately, collectively lead, and divide responsibilities; others include production, fertilizer accumulation, and water conservancy construction as part of the content of airing views, mobilizing everyone to put forward opinions, and promoting production through debate. In short, various places have adopted many methods to ensure that both production and rectification are not delayed.

The current problems in the work are: many cadres still have insufficient understanding of the significance of rural rectification, believing that it is the same as previous cooperative rectification, and it is enough to "solve a few specific problems" or criticize a few "troublemakers." Therefore, they do not pay attention to conducting in-depth and meticulous investigation and research work. Those who have entered the rectification stage lack sufficient ideological preparation, determination, and confidence. In some counties, the rural rectification work cannot be completed in one phase according to the number of forces and cooperatives. They are also reluctant to require the end of one phase, and each phase only lasts for more than 30 days. In this way, the time is short and the task is heavy, and the cadres feel insufficient, and the work is difficult to be meticulous.

### 陕西六千多个农业社开始整风

　　陕西六千多个农业社开始整风
    本报讯　陕西省汉中、安康专区各县以及西安、郃阳等二十六县（市）的六千二百九十四个农业社，从11月下旬起，先后开始全面整风。陕北、商雒专区各县，以及关中部分县，目前正在动员布置，训练干部，预计12月底左右即可全面展开。
    已开始整风地区目前除一部分社还正在宣传动员外，一般的已开始了大鸣大放。开展较早、进展较快的社，已结束了鸣放，正集中力量进行整改。
    为了指导农村整风工作，各县普遍成立了农村整风办公室，并抽调大批干部参加农村整风。已开始的六千多个社，共参加脱产干部一万一千余人。每社一般平均有一至三个干部。另外各县还训练了大批社干部，汉中专区各县共训练了四千六百多人，安康专区仅洵阳一个县就训练了一千三百多人。这批干部，经过训练后，思想水平普遍提高，对开展农村整风将起很大作用。各地整风工作步骤大体分为：大鸣大放，整顿组织、改进工作，开展大辩论，系统总结等四个阶段。时间一般在五十天左右。有些县第一批开展的大多数是三类社，问题多任务重，计划用两个月多的时间。
    为了使整风与冬季生产密切结合，有的社白天生产，晚上整风；有的将生产整风统一研究，分别安排，集体领导，分工负责；还有的把生产、积肥、修水利列为鸣放内容之一，发动大家提意见，通过辩论，推动生产。总之，各地都采取了很多办法，作到生产整风两不误。
    当前工作中的问题是：不少干部对农村整风意义还认识不足，认为和以往整社一样，只“解决几个具体问题”或批判几个“捣蛋人”就对了，因而不注意做深入细致的调查研究工作。进入整改阶段的，由于思想准备不足，决心不大、信心不足。也有些县的农村整风工作，按力量与社数不能一期搞完的，也勉强要求一期结束，每期只搞三十多天，这样时间短任务重，干部力量就感不足，工作难搞得细致。
