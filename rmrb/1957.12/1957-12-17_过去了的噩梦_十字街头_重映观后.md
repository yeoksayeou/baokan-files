　　The Nightmare of the Past
　　——After Watching the Re-screening of "Crossroads"

    I braved the severe cold to go and see "Crossroads."

    I sat in front of that seemingly blurred and distant silver screen, concentrating and holding my breath for two hours. My emotions were once again captured.

    This was the second time I had seen "Crossroads." The first time was eighteen years ago. At that time, I was still studying in Shanghai. I knew very little about life and the world; I only felt darkness and cold around me, and an indescribable weight bound my heart. Time flies, and eighteen years have passed in a flash. In these eighteen years, what earth-shattering changes have taken place on the land of China!

    Eighteen years ago, Chinese students (except for a few children of wealthy and powerful families) faced an inescapable fate: the beginning of unemployment upon graduation. Our motherland's beautiful rivers and mountains were already devastated, and the nation was subjected to the ravages and insults of foreign powers, while young students struggled in the ranks of the unemployed, suffering from hunger and cold, with no way to serve their country despite their enthusiasm. The movie "Crossroads" summarized and reflected precisely this kind of cursed reality. Therefore, after it was released in 1937, it won the welcome of progressive intellectual youth in Shanghai. It aroused our deep thoughts and strong resonance. I still clearly remember that on a late autumn night, after a few classmates and I finished watching "Crossroads," we walked a long way, and no one spoke the whole time. Everyone's expression was serious, and a ball of anger burned in our hearts. Later, in the darkness, someone started reciting Pushkin's "To Siberia's Mines," and everyone followed along in unison with passionate tones.

    We should thank director Shen Xiling for not only exposing the sinful reality of the old era in a relatively concentrated way through "Crossroads," but also issuing a call to rebellion to the people. Although the Kuomintang strangled the freedom of artistic creation, and the director and actors faced various complex difficulties, this call to rebellion against the old era was still conveyed to sensitive audiences in a roundabout way (mainly through Lao Liu's departure and letter). This greatly strengthened the determination of vacillating intellectuals to move forward courageously. I remember that several of the classmates who recited "To Siberia's Mines" together eventually took Lao Liu's path.

    Eighteen years! When I returned to Shanghai at the end of January this year, I saw how good the liberated Shanghai had become! The imperialists had all rolled out. Leaning on the railing by the river, I saw Chinese warships docked, Chinese factories emitting smoke, and Chinese workers holding a Spring Festival gala in the floating restaurant. Everywhere there were Chinese voices, sounds of joy!

    The threat of unemployment for intellectual youth has also been permanently eliminated. University graduates are no longer vagrants on the streets and competitors in a life of suffering. Before them lies a vast and free world, and a magnificent and bright future. Little Xu, if he has a spirit in the afterlife, will surely sleep peacefully with a smile.

    Some people say that "Crossroads" still has flaws. I think that as a historical footprint that has already been walked, we don't need to hide it. This movie does have some shortcomings. For example, the acting still cannot get rid of the influence of formalism; it is too enthusiastic in pursuing dramatic effects, and there are too many humorous "gags," which dilute the serious atmosphere to a considerable extent, and so on. However, all these shortcomings cannot conceal the serious epochal significance of the topic revealed by "Crossroads." It faithfully recorded a nightmare of the past for us—that cursed, damned old era ruled by imperialism and its lackeys!

    It's late at night. My heart still cannot be calm for a long time. The scenes of the past and present China are all lingering in my mind. I really want to fly back to Shanghai, fly to the top of the majestic "Shanghai Mansion," and shout loudly to the knowledge youth of Shanghai and the whole country: "My young friends, you are too happy! I bless you to live in this great era! May you cherish it!"

　　过去了的噩梦
　　——“十字街头”重映观后
　　之频
    我冒了严寒，去看“十字街头”。
    我在那显得模糊而茫远的银幕前，凝神屏息的坐了两个钟头。我的感情又一次的被俘掳了过去。
    这次是我第二度看“十字街头”。第一回看它，远在十八年前。那时，我还在上海读书。关于生活，关于这个世界，我知道得很少；只觉得四周黑暗而且阴冷，有一种不可名状的重压羁系在心头。时光稍纵即逝，一晃十八年过去了。这十八年间，中国的土地上发生了多少惊天动地的变迁！
    十八年前，中国学生（除了少数豪门权贵的子弟以外）都面临着一个难以逃避的厄运：毕业即失业的开始。祖国的锦绣河山已经残破不堪，国家民族受尽了异族的蹂躏和侮辱，而青年学生却挣扎在饥寒交迫的失业大军的行列里，满怀热忱，无由报国。“十字街头”这部电影所概括了和反映了的，正是这样一种可诅咒的现实。因而，它在1937年问世以后，就赢得上海进步知识青年群众的欢迎。它激起了我们深沉的思索和强烈的共鸣。我还清楚的记得，在一个深秋的夜晚，我和几个同学看完“十字街头”出来，走了很长的一程路，始终没有一个人说话。大家的神情严肃，心里燃烧着一团怒火。后来，在黑暗里，不知道是谁开始诵读了普希金的“致西伯利亚囚徒”，大家跟着用激昂的调子合诵了起来。
    应当感谢导演沈西苓先生，他不仅通过“十字街头”比较集中的暴露了那旧时代的罪恶的现实，而且向人们发出了叛逆的号召。尽管国民党扼杀着艺术创作的自由，导演和演员面临着种种复杂的困难，但是，这种向旧时代挑战的叛逆的号召，还是曲曲折折地（主要是借着老刘的出走和来信）传达给了敏感的观众。这就大大增强了彷徨中的知识青年勇往直前的决心。记得，我们一起朗诵“致西伯利亚囚徒”的同学，后来，有几个终于走上了老刘的道路。
    十八年了！今年1月底我回上海，看到解放了的上海变得多好啊！帝国主义者全部滚了出去。倚着江畔的栏杆望去，停泊着的是中国的军舰，冒烟的是中国的工厂，水上饭店里正在举行春节联欢晚会的是中国的劳动者。到处喧腾着中国的声音，欢乐的声音！
    知识青年失业的威胁也已经永远被解脱，大学毕业生不再是街头的流浪汉和苦难人生的角逐者。在他们的面前，有着广阔自由的天地，有着壮丽灿烂的未来。小徐地下有灵，定然会含笑长眠的罢。
    有人说“十字街头”还有缺陷。我想，作为已经走过的历史足迹，我们也不需要隐讳它。这部电影的确有一些缺点。例如，演技还摆不掉形式主义的影响；太热中于追求戏剧效果，插科打诨的“噱头”过多，以致相当程度的冲淡了严肃的氛围，等等。但是，这一切缺点，都掩盖不了“十字街头”所揭示的严重时代意义的课题。它为我们忠实地记录了一个过去了的噩梦——那个可诅咒的该死的帝国主义及其奴才统治着的旧时代！
    夜深了。我的心还久久的不能平静。过去的和现在的中国的情景，都一齐萦回于脑际。我真想飞回上海，飞到巍峨的“上海大厦”的顶上，向上海，向全国的知识青年高声呼喊：“我的青年朋友们，你们太幸福了！我祝福你们活在这伟大的时代！愿你们宝爱它！”
