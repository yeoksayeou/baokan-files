	Producing Light Bulbs Below Ten Watts
	Currently, the smallest light bulbs produced by various light bulb factories are fifteen watts, which does not meet the needs. Because now many office buildings and dormitories have toilets that are generally only one or two square meters, a five-watt light bulb would suffice. Corridors in general dormitories would be bright enough with a ten-watt bulb. If fifteen-watt or higher light bulbs are installed everywhere, the nation would waste an unknown amount of electricity each month! Therefore, I suggest that various light bulb factories produce some light bulbs below ten watts to meet the needs of the majority of users.

    生产十瓦以下的灯泡
    目前各灯泡厂生产的灯泡，最小的是十五瓦，这不能满足需要。因为现在许多办公楼和宿舍里的厕所，一般只有一、二平方公尺，安个五瓦的灯泡就行了。一般宿舍的走廊，安个十瓦的也就够亮的了。如果无论什么地方都安十五瓦以上的灯泡，全国每月不知浪费了多少电！所以，我建议各灯泡厂生产一些十瓦以下的灯泡，来满足广大用户的需要。
