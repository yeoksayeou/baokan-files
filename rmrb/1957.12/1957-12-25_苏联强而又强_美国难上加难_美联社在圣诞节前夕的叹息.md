Xinhua News Agency, December 24th dispatch from Washington: The Associated Press issued some news on December 23rd summarizing the situation before Christmas. These reports acknowledged that the international situation has undergone tremendous changes, the strength of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp has surpassed the West, and the difficulties of the U.S. ruling group are growing unprecedentedly.

The news agency's Moscow correspondent, Milks, said that the Soviet Union will enter the new year with Western countries in a "defensive" position in several respects. He said, "The scientific and technological achievements of the Soviet Union in launching two artificial satellites and intercontinental missiles, coupled with the support of the obvious political unity of the communist world, make 1958 seem like a difficult year for the West." Milks spoke of the constantly increasing grain production in the Soviet Union, the creation of many new records in industrial production, and the prospect of further improvements in people's living standards.

The situation in the United States is not like this. The news agency said that the United States is currently "uneasy" due to the success of the Soviet artificial satellites and the failure of the U.S. "Vanguard" rocket test, and is "nervous about signs of a recession in the national economy."

The Associated Press's Washington correspondent, Marou, said, "For U.S. President Eisenhower, this Christmas cannot be a pleasant one. Because he will find that the doubts about his leadership are more serious than at any time in his life. And not just because of his health."

Marou said that when Eisenhower took office in 1953, "the United States was ahead of the Russians militarily. But now the situation is different." "Eisenhower must now decide how to catch up with the Soviet Union. But this raises other problems that urgently need to be solved." Eisenhower wants to "increase military spending. But in doing so, he will encounter two tasks, one is to curb inflation and the other is to curb the growing economic recession. At the same time, the cost of living is almost constantly rising, and now there is the added problem of unemployment." In diplomacy, Eisenhower also encountered difficulties. For example, in "dealing" with the Soviet Union, the United States used to be able to "proceed from a position of strength," but now it doesn't work anymore.

### 苏联强而又强　美国难上加难  美联社在圣诞节前夕的叹息

    苏联强而又强　美国难上加难
    美联社在圣诞节前夕的叹息
    据新华社24日讯　华盛顿消息：美联社23日发出了圣诞节前综述局势的一些消息，这些消息承认国际形势已经发生了巨大变化，苏联和社会主义阵营的力量超过了西方，美国统治集团的困难正在空前增长。
    这家通讯社驻莫斯科记者米尔克斯说，苏联将在西方国家在若干方面处于“守势”的情况下进入新的一年。他说，“苏联发射两颗人造卫星和洲际导弹方面所获得的科学和技术上的成就，加上共产主义世界明显的政治团结的支持，使得1958年对西方来说似乎将是困难的一年”。米尔克斯谈到苏联粮食产量不断增加、工业生产创造了许多新纪录以及人民生活水平进一步提高的前景。
    美国的情况就不是这样。这家通讯社说，美国目前正在由于苏联人造卫星的成功和美国“先锋”式火箭试验失败而“感到不安”，并且对于“国民经济有衰退的迹象感到神经紧张”。
    美联社驻华盛顿记者马劳说，“对于美国总统艾森豪威尔说来，今年的圣诞节不可能是一个愉快的圣诞节。因为他将发现他的领导地位所受到的怀疑比在他一生中的任何时候更为严重。并不只是因为他的健康。”
    马劳说，当艾森豪威尔在1953年执政的时候，“美国在军事上是走在俄国人的前面的。但是现在的情形不同了”。“艾森豪威尔现在必须决定怎样赶上苏联。但是从这一点产生了急需解决的其他问题。”艾森豪威尔要“增加军事开支。但是他在这样做的时候将碰到两项任务，一方面要制止通货膨胀、另方面制止日益增长的经济衰退现象。同时，生活费用几乎在不断上涨，目前又加上失业问题。”在外交方面，艾森豪威尔也遇到了困难。例如，同苏联“打交道”，美国以前可以“从实力出发”，但是现在已经行不通。
