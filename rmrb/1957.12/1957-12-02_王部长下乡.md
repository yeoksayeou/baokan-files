　　Minister Wang Goes to the Countryside
　　Jian Zhong
    Once, while I was talking with a comrade from the Hongzhao County Committee about County Secretary Wang Xiujin, I asked him, "Secretary Wang has been transferred from the Provincial Party Committee's Rural Work Department to here for almost eight months. In your opinion, what aspect of his work stands out the most?"
    Without even thinking, he replied, "Going to the countryside!"
    Frequently going to the countryside is indeed a characteristic of Comrade Wang Xiujin's work. From the day the Provincial Party Committee approved his request to go to the grassroots this spring, he happily thought: I can live with the peasant masses again, just like I did ten years ago.
    Recently, I had the opportunity to stay in the Xiong Huo Agricultural Cooperative for half a month with a work group led by him. This time, going to the countryside was mainly to explore, based on the spirit of the Third Plenary Session and the Forty Articles, how to use the debate on production and construction as a link, on the basis of the socialist debate, to stir up a production upsurge throughout the county.
  The cooperative cadres arranged for the work group to stay in a cave dwelling that had served as a hideout during the War of Resistance Against Japan. After putting down his luggage, he went to find cooperative cadres and experienced old farmers to lead him to inspect the fields and river滩 (tān - a flat, sandy area near a river), and to listen to the masses' opinions and requests for transforming nature. In the evening, he found farmers to come to the cave dwelling for heart-to-heart talks, to understand the ideological state of the broad masses and the ideological changes of the wealthy middle peasants during the debate on the two roads. Then, he carefully and thoroughly explained the spirit of the Third Plenary Session and the Forty Articles to the masses in simple terms, observing their reactions and faithfully pondering the questions they raised.
    When the masses were discussing production potential and formulating production plans, he valued every opinion. Once, in the midst of a noisy discussion, someone sighed and said, "No matter how great the potential, no matter how clever the methods, it won't work if people's hearts don't return to the cooperative." He also noticed this remark. After analyzing it with the comrades in the work group, he immediately mobilized the masses to continue to speak out freely on the issue of production and construction. In just a few days, the masses expressed thousands of opinions, enabling the work group to find the key to carrying out the debate and the basis for formulating plans. When the masses debated how to achieve increased production, and when wealthy middle peasant Zhang Shanzi and others proposed contracting production to individual households, which was opposed by everyone, he explored the positive factors in Zhang Shanzi's negative opinion.
    "You are very diligent and frugal, and you also have production skills. I heard that this year, the cooperative had nine mu of saline-alkali land planted with cotton, and you came up with the method of 'digging pits and replacing soil,' which resulted in a bumper harvest, didn't you?" Comrade Wang Xiujin asked Zhang Shanzi with a kind smile, like a close friend.
    "Secretary Wang, in the past, we were also tenants for landlords. It wasn't until the land reform that we had a few mu of land. It's not that I don't want to run the cooperative well, but..."
    "What do you think about the method of contracting production to individual households? Hmm?"
    "If the cooperative contracts the land to me, how about we compare yields in the fall? Those young people say I want to go back to the old ways. As I see it, they don't want to contract production to individual households because they still want to work without paying attention to quality, just to muddle through and earn work points."
    "Hmm! So, if the cooperative seriously implements contracting work and output, and we find a way to get everyone to work for the cooperative as sincerely as you do, and you pass on your past farming techniques to the cooperative, do you think that would be better than contracting production to individual households?"
    "Well, let's see, let's see if the cooperative can do it!" Zhang Shanzi looked at Wang Xiujin's face and smiled knowingly.
    It was clear that Comrade Wang Xiujin determined that Zhang Shanzi's proposal to contract production to individual households was not out of malice. He was mainly dissatisfied with the shortcomings in the cooperative's management. Behind his negative opinion was a positive desire to run the cooperative well. After a debate, the wealthy middle peasants' proposal for "contracting production to individual households" was naturally criticized. From exploring potential, they saw that many important measures to increase production, such as building water conservancy projects and improving large areas of land, could only be implemented with the collective production methods of the cooperative. They then automatically abandoned the proposal for "contracting production to individual households." At the same time, their proposal also promoted the cooperative's management and improved everyone's confidence in relying on the cooperative to achieve production plans. Everyone wants to reach the production level of wealthy middle peasants in the cooperative within ten years, doubling the production levels.
    In short, in Comrade Wang Xiujin's mind, "every word of the masses is useful." Every action of the masses strengthens his strength and determination.
    This day, after the masses discussed the Forty Articles, they proposed to immediately start work on dredging the canals. This news made Comrade Wang Xiujin's heart stir. So he took off his clothes, rolled up his trouser legs, and jumped into the cold, muddy bottom of the canal to work with the masses. During the break, he chatted with everyone about the prospects for rural development, observed their expressions, and felt their strong desire to increase production. In less than a day, everyone dug the canal that used to take three days to dig. He returned to the cave dwelling, washed off the mud splattered on his face, and then sat and lay on the kang, thinking: How great is the potential on the agricultural front? It's really impossible to figure out! In the past, sitting in the provincial Party committee office, seeing factories being built here and roads being built there, I felt that socialism was advancing rapidly, and it seemed that this speed of progress was mainly reflected in the cities. As for the countryside, although I felt it was important and that it had potential, it was always somewhat abstract and conceptual. Now, standing by the side of the masses, breathing with the masses, this abstract concept has become concrete, and I feel that the potential hidden in the countryside, which is many times greater than that of the cities, is so in need of the Party to lead the masses to develop it! From this, he felt the importance of his position even more. His understanding of the Forty Articles for agricultural development became particularly profound, practical, and full of flesh and blood.
    Because Comrade Wang Xiujin often comes into contact with reality and understands the demands of the masses, he can make his leadership work well-grounded and full of vitality. Some township work cadres come to him to discuss work, and he can propose the most practical solutions based on the specific circumstances of each place and his own personal experience.
    This morning, Comrade Wang Xiujin was about to go to understand the progress of the work of the production planning special team organized by the masses themselves. Kang Pilie, the energetic county magistrate who was transferred down here with him, walked into the cave dwelling excitedly with a water conservancy cadre. He said that the plan to build the Fen River Third Main Canal had been approved by the County People's Congress the day before yesterday. Some remaining specific issues need to be discussed further. As he spoke, he unfolded a "Plan of the Third Main Canal" and asked where two small hydropower stations should be located, how the funds should be used, and so on.
    This is a canal that runs through the entire territory of Hongzhao County. With this canal, a large number of low-lying areas along the Fen River can be transformed into fertile land; it can connect the existing canals in the county so that 70% of the land in the county can be irrigated. The members of the Xiong Huo Cooperative, like the broad masses of the province, have dreamed of this Third Main Canal, which can change the face of the county and bring happiness to the people, for many years, but it has never been realized. After liberation, it could be realized, but they wanted to rely entirely on state investment. At the same time, on some specific projects, they often started from the local interests of their own village and cooperative, and their opinions were inconsistent. Now, the masses of the county have raised their socialist ideological awareness in the great debate, and the County People's Congress has unanimously passed a resolution on "people-run and government-assisted" to build the Third Main Canal. However, there is one issue related to the economic interests of a part of the Xiong Huo Cooperative that has not yet been finalized, which is whether the section of the canal passing through the head of Xiong Huo Cooperative village should "go high" or "go low." The advantage of "going high" is that the cooperative can use the method of flooding with floodwater to transform hundreds of mu of river滩 (tān - a flat, sandy area near a river) land. The disadvantage is that in order to draw water from a low place to a high hill, it will cost more manpower and financial resources than the income from these hundreds of mu of river灘 (tān - a flat, sandy area near a river) land, and it will not be beneficial to the entire Third Main Canal.
    "Let's discuss it with the masses and decide. The masses are always reasonable." When County Magistrate Kang raised this question, Comrade Wang Xiujin immediately found the Xiong Huo Cooperative cadres and people's representatives, explained the advantages and disadvantages of the "going high" project they hoped for, explained the principle of spending less money and doing more, and focusing on the overall situation, and asked them to consider and choose.
    "Obey the overall situation, go low!" Cooperative Director Zhang Shengsun thought for a while and said.
    "Yes, go low. As long as we have this Third Main Canal, it will benefit everyone. We'll start work after the October Revolution Day." Party Branch Secretary Zhang Junwa and the representatives said, hitting the edge of the kang forcefully with their fists.
    At this time, Comrade Wang Xiujin's simple and happy eyes moved away from the faces of the cooperative cadres and representatives. He suddenly felt full of strength and immediately went with everyone to the Fen River to inspect the canal of the Third Main Canal.
    Comrade Wang Xiujin lives and works closely with the masses in this way. Once, when I asked him about his experience since being transferred down, he said modestly, "In the past, there were many people like me who were floating in the air. Today, the Party calls on everyone to go to the countryside and go up the mountains, and there are even more people like me. To talk about experience, it is to be at ease, to be at ease in the long term from an ideological and emotional point of view, and to regard going to the countryside as normal life. If you are a leader, then bring your leadership work to the masses, otherwise, squatting in the office can be bureaucracy, and going to the countryside can also be bureaucracy." This is very useful for those comrades who are not at ease in rural work or who regard going to the countryside as a "temporary task." (Attached picture)

　　王部长下乡
　　剑仲
    有一次，我和洪赵县委会一个同志谈起县委书记王绣锦同志的时候，我问他：“王书记由省委农村工作部部长下放到这里快八个月了，据你看，他在工作上哪方面表现得最突出？”
    他连思索一下也没有就回答说：“下乡嘛！”
    经常下乡，这的确是王绣锦同志工作上的一个特点。从今年春天省委同意了他到基层去的意愿那天起，他就愉快地想：又能像十年前那样，经常和农民群众生活在一起了。
    最近，我有机会和他所率领的一个工作组一起到雄火农业社住了半个月。这次下乡，主要是根据三中全会精神和四十条纲要，去探索如何由社会主义大辩论的基础上，用生产建设大辩论这条纽带，在全县掀动起一个生产高潮。
  社干部把工作组安置在一座曾在抗日战争时期做过隐蔽所的窑洞里。他放下行李卷，就去找社干部和有经验的老农领着到四野查看土地和河滩，听取群众对改造大自然的意见和要求。晚上，又找农民到窑洞来促膝谈心，了解广大群众的思想状态，和富裕中农在两条道路大辩论当中的思想变化。然后，再把三中全会的精神和四十条纲要，仔细地，深入浅出地讲解给群众听，看他们有什么反应，忠诚地琢磨着他们提出来的问题。
    群众讨论增产潜力制订生产规划的时候，他对每一条意见都很重视。有次在一片吵嚷声中有人叹气说：“潜力再大，法子再巧，人心不归社也是不行。”这话也被他注意了，他和工作组的同志一分析，立刻发动群众在生产建设问题上继续大鸣大放，不几天的工夫群众就鸣放出来上千条意见，使工作组从中找到了开展辩论的关键和制订规划的依据。群众辩论如何实现增产的时候，当富裕中农张善子等提出包产到户的主张遭到大家反对的时候，他却探索着张善子这个消极意见中的积极因素。
    “你很勤俭，也有生产技术。听说今年社里有九亩盐咸地棉花是你想出了“挖坑换土”的办法，结果丰收了，是不是？”王绣锦同志像个知心朋友一样，笑容可掬地问着张善子。
    “王书记，过去咱也是给地主当佃户，土改才算有了几亩地。咱也不是不想把合作社搞好，可……”
    “你看把产量包到户这办法到底好不好？嗯？”
    “社里把地包到我手，秋后咱们比产量好不好？那些年轻人说我想走回头路，照我看，他们不愿包产到户就是还想干活不讲质量，光混工分。”
    “唔！这样说要是社里认真实行包工包产，咱们想法叫大家像你那样真心给社干活，你把过去自己种地的技术都传授到社里来，你看这样比包产到户是不是更好些？”
    “那，看吧，看社里做到做不到！”张善子望着王绣锦的脸，会意地微笑着。
    这就清楚了，王绣锦同志断定张善子提出包产到户并非出于恶意，他主要是不满意合作社管理上存在的缺点，在他的这个消极意见后面蕴藏着希望办好合作社的积极要求。经过一场辩论，富裕中农的“包产到户”的主张固然受到批判，他们从挖掘潜力当中，看到许多重要增产措施如兴修水利，改良大片土地等，只有合作社的集体生产方式才有条件实行，他们便自动放弃了“包产到户”的主张。而同时，他们这种主张也促进了合作社的经营管理，提高了大家依靠合作社实现生产规划的信心。大家要在十年内，使合作社的生产水平达到富裕中农生产水平的两倍。
    总之，在王绣锦同志的心目中，“群众的每一句话都是有用的。”群众的每一行动都增强着他的力量与决心。
    这天，群众讨论过四十条纲要，便提出马上动工疏浚渠道，这个消息使王绣锦同志的心情为之一振，于是他脱下衣服，挽起裤脚，跳下冰冷泥泞的渠底和群众一起劳动起来了。休息的时候，他和大家闲谈着农村发展远景，观察着他们的表情，感受着他们内心那种强烈的增产要求。不到一天的工夫，大家就挖完了这条往年总要三天才能挖得完的渠道。他回到窖洞，洗掉被溅到脸上的泥浆，然后就坐卧在炕边想：农业战线上的潜力到底有多大，真是叫人没法捉摸啊！过去坐在省委机关里，看到这里盖工厂，那里修马路，便觉得社会主义在飞速前进，仿佛这种前进速度主要表现在城市里。至于农村，虽说也感到它重要，感到它有潜力，可总有些抽象化、概念化。现在，自己站在群众身边，和群众一起呼吸，这个抽象的概念才具体化起来，才感到蕴藏在农村的、比城市不知要大多少倍的潜力，是多么需要党来领导群众开发呀！由此他越发感到自己的岗位的重要。他对农业发展四十条纲要的体会也就格外深切、实际，和有血有肉。
    正因为王绣锦同志经常接触实际，了解群众的要求，他也就能使自己的领导工作有根有底，生气勃勃。有些乡的工作干部来找他商量工作，他都能根据各地的具体情况和自己的亲身体验，提出最切合实际的解决办法。
    这天上午，王绣锦同志正要去了解由群众自己组织的生产规划专门小组的工作进展情况，那个和他一块下放到这里的、精力充沛的康丕烈县长，带着一个水利干部兴冲冲地走进了窑洞。说，修建汾河三干渠的计划，前天已经在县人民代表大会上通过了。剩下的一些具体问题要再来商量一下。他说着便把一张“三干渠沿线平面图”展开来，提出两个小型水电站设在那里好，资金如何使用，等等。
    这是一条贯串洪赵县全境的渠道，有了这条渠就可把汾河沿岸的大量洼地改变成良田；可以连结县境内已有的几道渠道使全县70％的土地都能灌溉。雄火社的社员们和全省广大群众一样，对这条能够改变全县面貌，给人们带来幸福的三干渠梦想了多年，但总不能实现。解放以后能够实现了，他们却又想完全依赖国家投资，同时在某些具体工程上又往往从本村本社的局部利益出发，而意见不一致。现在，全县群众在大辩论中提高了社会主义思想觉悟，县人民代表大会一致通过了一个“民办公助”修三干渠的决议，但其中有一个关连到雄火社一部分经济利益的问题还没有最后取得一致的意见，这就是三干渠经过雄火社村头的一段渠道是“走高线”还是“走低线”，“走高线”的好处是，社里有几百亩河滩地可以用洪水淤漫的办法来加以改造，坏处是为了把水由低处引上一段高岗就要化费比这几百亩河滩地收益大得多的人力和财力，同时对整个三干渠也没有什么好处。
    “还是和群众来商量决定吧，群众总是讲道理的。”当康县长提出这个问题的时候，王绣锦同志立刻把雄火社社干部和人民代表找来，说明他们所希望的“走高线”的工程的利害，说明少花钱多办事、从全局着眼的原则，请他们考虑和选择。
    “服从全局，走低线！”社主任张生顺思索了一会，说。
    “对，走低线，只要有了这条三干渠对大家都有好处。过了十月革命节就动工。”党支部书记张俊娃和代表们说着，拳头用力往炕沿上一捶。
    这时候，王绣锦同志那双朴实而又快乐的眼睛才从社干部和代表们的脸上移开来，他顿时觉得浑身充满了力量，立刻就和大家到汾河那边去查看三干渠渠道去了。
    王绣锦同志就是这样密切地和群众在一起生活着，工作着。有一次当我问起他下放以来的体会的时候，他谦逊地说：“过去像我这种浮在空中的人不少，今天党号召大家下乡上山，像我这种人也更多。要说体会，那就是安心，从思想感情上长期安心，把下乡看做是正常生活。如果是领导者，那就把领导工作带到群众中去，否则蹲在机关里可以是官僚主义，下乡也可以是官僚主义。”关于这一点，对于那些不安心农村工作，或者把下乡看做是一项“临时任务”的同志，是很有用处的。（附图片）
