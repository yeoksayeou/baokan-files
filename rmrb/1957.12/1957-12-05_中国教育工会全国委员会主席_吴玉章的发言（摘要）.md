Speech by Wu Yuzhang, Chairman of the National Committee of the Educational Workers' Union of China (Summary)

Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the work of the Educational Workers' Union of China has greatly developed and improved over the past four years. The number of members has increased from 767,800 in 1953 to the current 2,012,212, accounting for 80% of the total number of education and science workers. Educational Workers' Union organizations at all levels, in the ideological remolding movement and daily ideological and political education work, have assisted Party committees in mobilizing and organizing the masses to participate in theoretical study and the study of current affairs and policies, playing a positive role in implementing the Party's policy of uniting, educating, and remolding intellectuals. Educational Workers' Union organizations at all levels, based on the needs and possibilities of the masses, have extensively carried out mass-based professional activities through new-old mutual assistance, professional lectures, production meetings (or professional seminars), rationalization proposals, and other forms. In order to improve the material and cultural lives of education and science workers, educational workers' union organizations have also carried out multifaceted welfare work and rich and colorful cultural and sports activities, encouraging them to actively and effectively complete the tasks of educational construction and scientific research stipulated in the country's first Five-Year Plan.

However, in implementing the guidelines and tasks stipulated by the Seventh National Congress of Trade Unions, there has been a certain degree of blindness in our work.

The Educational Workers' Union is an intellectual union mainly composed of teachers and scientific research workers. It differs greatly from other unions with industrial workers as their main members. This difference, in addition to the characteristic that the main members of the Educational Workers' Union—teachers and scientific research workers—are mental laborers, is that although they are also people who rely on wage income as a source of livelihood and should belong to the working class, due to the influence of their family background and past education, the majority of them are still bourgeois and petty-bourgeois intellectuals in terms of ideology. We did not have sufficient understanding of this characteristic in the past. Therefore, after the Central Committee convened a meeting on the issue of intellectuals in January 1956, on the one hand, it aroused the attention of the whole Party and the whole country to the work of intellectuals, and thus gave a great impetus to the work of the Educational Workers' Union. However, on the other hand, our understanding of the spirit of the Central Committee was not comprehensive. We only saw the importance of the role of intellectuals and the progressive side of them. Therefore, in practical work, we showed one-sided emphasis on care, accommodating them everywhere, and only grasped the work of improving their working conditions and living conditions (which, of course, should be done and must be done in the future), but relaxed the ideological and political work for them. This shows that we only emphasized the unity side in implementing the Party's policy on intellectuals, but relaxed the remolding side. It was not until the in-depth development of the current rectification and anti-rightist movement and the prominent exposure of problems that we more clearly defined this characteristic, that is, for the majority of scientific research workers and teachers, the issue of their position and who they serve has not been completely resolved. This situation shows that among the majority of the main members of the Educational Workers' Union, socialist remolding should still be carried out politically and ideologically. Moreover, since they are people who educate others and are known as soul engineers, according to the principle that "educators must be educated," ideological and political education for them is even more important.

Based on our past work experience and the current new situation, and based on the spirit of Chairman Mao's speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," in order to fully mobilize the vast number of education workers and science workers to meet and realize the Second Five-Year Plan with greater enthusiasm, we believe that the Educational Workers' Union should especially strengthen the following three aspects of work in the future:

First, it is necessary to strengthen ideological and political work and assist the Party in carrying out ideological remolding of education and science workers. In addition to the current need to carry out the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle to the end, we must comprehensively implement the Party's policy of uniting, educating, and remolding intellectuals in the work of the trade union. This is an important task for the Educational Workers' Union for a considerable period of time to come. The remolding of intellectuals should mainly rely on self-education, and the Educational Workers' Union is precisely a mass organization for education and science workers to conduct self-education and self-remolding. In addition to continuing to strengthen daily ideological and political work, the trade union should, in the future, regard organizing education and science workers to participate in physical labor and organizing visits as an important task in order to enable them to gain confidence in the future of socialism through observation and practice in social life.

Second, the trade union must fully play its regulatory role in correctly handling internal contradictions in schools. The emergence of contradictions among the people in schools, like in other aspects, is due to no more than two reasons: one is certain bureaucracy on the part of school leaders, and the other is the existence of certain backward ideologies among the masses. The trade union should, on the one hand, play a role in supervising the masses and help school leaders effectively overcome bureaucracy, and on the other hand, carry out persuasive education on certain unreasonable or excessive demands of the masses. In the past, the trade union has also used forms such as membership meetings or representative conferences and production meetings to put forward criticisms and suggestions to administrative leaders, and has also done some publicity and explanation work to the masses, thereby playing a certain regulatory role; in the future, under the leadership of the Party committee, it should play a regulatory role with more clear purpose and initiative.

Third, the trade union must assist the administration in running socialist education well and complete the national education plan. According to past experience, the trade union, whether in expanding teachers' knowledge fields, researching and exchanging teaching experience, improving teaching methods, teaching organization, and teaching management, coordinating the relationship between teaching departments and auxiliary departments, improving the professional level of teaching auxiliary personnel, or improving teaching conditions, in mobilizing the masses to discuss and revise teaching plans, work plans, and organizing the masses to ensure the completion of plans, can and should do a lot of work.

If the Educational Workers' Union does the above work well, it will be possible to encourage the vast number of teachers and scientific workers to implement the state's requirements for them stipulated in the Second Five-Year Plan with great confidence and courage, and it will also be possible to play its role in the great historical task of the Party's construction of a large army of working-class intellectuals.

　　中国教育工会全国委员会主席
　　吴玉章的发言（摘要）
    中国教育工会的工作在党中央和全国总工会的领导下，四年多来有了很大的发展和提高。会员人数已由1953年的767，800人，增加到现在的2，012，212人，占教育、科学工作者总人数的80％。各地教育工会组织，在思想改造运动和日常的思想政治教育工作方面，协助党委动员和组织群众参加理论学习和时事政策学习，对于贯彻党的团结、教育、改造知识分子的政策都起了一定的积极作用。各地教育工会组织根据群众需要与可能，通过新老互助，业务讲座，生产会议（或业务座谈会），合理化建议等形式，广泛开展了群众性的业务活动。为了改善教育、科学工作者的物质、文化生活，教育工会组织还开展了多方面的生活福利工作和丰富多采的文化体育活动。鼓舞他们积极地有效地完成了国家第一个五年计划规定的教育建设和科学研究的任务。
    但是，我们在贯彻执行工会“七大”规定的方针任务的时候，在我们的工作中却存在着某种程度的盲目性。
    教育工会，是一个以教师和科学研究工作者为主体的知识分子工会。它和其它以产业工人为主要成员的工会有着很大的不同。这种不同，除了教育工会的主要成员——教师和科学研究工作者是脑力劳动者这一特点外，他们虽然也是以工资收入为生活资料来源的人，应该属于工人阶级，但由于他们的家庭出身和过去所受教育的影响，他们的大多数在意识形态上还是资产阶级和小资产阶级知识分子。这一特点，在过去我们是认识不够的。因此，在1956年1月中央召开了关于知识分子问题的会议以后，一方面引起了全党、全国对于知识分子工作的重视，因而也对教育工会的工作给予了很大推动。但是另一方面我们对中央的精神的领会是不全面的，只看到了知识分子作用的重要和他们进步的一面，因而在实际工作中表现了片面强调照顾，处处迁就，只抓住了改善他们的工作条件、生活条件的工作（这当然是应该做而且今后也还必须做的），却放松了对他们的思想政治工作。这就说明我们在执行党的知识分子政策时只强调了团结的一面，而放松了改造的一面。直到这次整风、反右运动深入展开，问题突出地暴露出来了以后，我们才比较地明确了这一特点，即对于多数科学研究工作者和教师群众来说，他们的立场和为谁服务的问题并未完全解决。这一情况，就表明在教育工会的主要成员的大部分人当中，还应当在政治上和思想上进行社会主义改造。又由于他们是教育人的人，被誉为灵魂工程师，根据“教育者必须受教育”这一原理，对他们的思想政治教育就更加重要了。
    根据我们过去工作中的经验和当前新的形势，根据毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”讲话的精神，为了充分动员广大教育工作者、科学工作者以更大的热情迎接和实现第二个五年计划，我们认为教育工会今后应特别加强下面三方面的工作：
    首先是必须加强思想政治工作，协助党对教育、科学工作者进行思想改造。除了目前必须把整风运动和反右斗争进行到底外，我们必须在工会工作中全面贯彻党团结、教育、改造知识分子的政策。这是教育工会在今后相当长的一个时期内的重要任务。知识分子的改造主要应依靠自我教育，而教育工会正是教育、科学工作者进行自我教育、自我改造的群众组织。工会在这方面的工作除继续加强日常的思想政治工作外，今后应把组织教育、科学工作者参加体力劳动，组织参观、访问，以便使他们通过社会生活的观察和实践获得对于社会主义前途的信心，作为一项重要任务。
    其次，工会必须在正确处理学校内部矛盾方面充分发挥自己的调节作用。学校中的人民内部矛盾的产生，也和其他方面一样，其原因不外两种，一个是学校领导方面的某些官僚主义，一个是群众中还存在某些落后思想意识。工会就应该一方面发挥群众监督作用，帮助学校领导上有效地克服官僚主义，另方面对群众的某些不合理的或过高的要求进行说服教育。工会过去也曾采用会员大会或代表大会、生产会议等形式对行政领导提出批评、建议，也曾向群众做了一些宣传解释工作，从而起到了一定的调节作用；今后应在党委领导下，更加有明确目的地和主动地发挥调节作用。
    再次，工会必须协助行政办好社会主义教育事业，完成国家教育计划。根据过去的经验，工会不论在扩大教师的知识领域、研究和交流教学经验、改进教学方法、教学组织和教学管理，协调教学部门与辅助部门的关系，提高教学辅助人员的业务水平和改善教学条件方面，在发动群众讨论、修订教学计划、工作计划以及组织群众保证完成计划等方面，都是可以而且应该做许多工作的。
    教育工会做好了上面这些工作，就有可能鼓舞广大教工群众和科学工作者以极大的信心和勇气来贯彻实行第二个五年计划规定的国家对他们的要求，也就有可能在党建设工人阶级知识分子大军的伟大历史任务中，发挥自己的作用。
