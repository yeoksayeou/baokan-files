Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 23rd: People from all walks of life in Indonesia have expressed their support for the upcoming Asian-African Solidarity Conference, believing that this conference will support the Indonesian people's just struggle against Dutch colonialism.

Today, Indonesian newspapers published an open letter from the National Committee of the All-Indonesia People's Congress. The letter stated that the Asian-African Solidarity Conference will strengthen the unity of the Asian and African peoples in their struggle against colonialism.

The letter stated that the Indonesian people have always paid close attention to and cared about the development of the struggles of the Asian and African countries for independence, because any progress and victory achieved in their struggles will affect the Indonesian people's struggle for complete independence. The letter pointed out that the victory of the Egyptian people in resisting Anglo-French aggression and the achievements of the Chinese people in the first five-year plan are good examples.

The letter also stated that the Indonesian government's decision on the issue of territorial waters is a serious blow to imperialist countries conducting war demonstrations and military build-ups in Indonesian territorial waters. The actions of these imperialist countries threaten the national independence of Indonesia and its neighbors. The letter said that the Indonesian people will certainly be able to maintain their sovereignty over all territorial waters.

Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd: New York dispatch: Indonesian Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Sastroamidjojo, said in an American television program on the 22nd that if the Netherlands' position on the West Irian issue does not change, there will be no place for Dutch interests in Indonesia. He also warned Western countries not to interfere in this dispute.

Sastroamidjojo told a group of Americans who were asking questions, "If a part of your country were occupied by another country, you would act the same way as we do." In response to questions about the cultural and racial differences between the West Irian people and the Indonesian people, he pointed out that if race were the determining factor in national qualifications, the United States would be divided into many parts. He also expressed his disapproval of the idea of holding a plebiscite in West Irian.

    信上说，印度尼西亚人民一向密切注意和关怀亚非各国人民争取独立的斗争的发展，因为在他们的斗争中所取得的任何进展和胜利都会影响到印度尼西亚人民为争取完全独立而进行的斗争。信上指出，埃及人民在反对英法侵略中取得的胜利以及中国人民在第一个五年计划中取得的成就都是良好的榜样。
    信上还说，印度尼西亚政府关于领海问题的决定，对于在印度尼西亚领海上进行战争示威和军事集结的帝国主义国家是一个严重的打击。这些帝国主义国家的行动使印度尼西亚和它的邻国的民族独立受到了威胁。信上说，印度尼西亚人民一定能够保持他们对全部领海的主权。
    据新华社23日讯　纽约消息：印度尼西亚驻联合国常任代表沙斯特罗阿米佐约22日在美国电视节目中发表谈话说，如果荷兰在西伊里安问题上的立场不改变的话，印度尼西亚就将没有荷兰利益插足的地方。他还警告西方国家不要干涉这个争端。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约向一群提问题的美国人说，“如果你们的国家的一部分被另一个国家侵占的话，你们将同我们 一样地行动。”他在回答关于西伊里安人和印度尼西亚人在文化上种族上不同的问题时指出，如果种族是决定国家资格的因素的话，美国就将分裂成很多部分。他还表示不赞成在西伊里安举行公民投票的意见。
