New Year's Day Breakfast

    On the morning of New Year's Day, the whole family sits around the table, drinking a bowl of hot almond tea and eating a few shredded radish cakes. This doesn't cost much and has a very New Year's atmosphere.

    Now, let me introduce how to make almond tea and shredded radish cakes:

    Almond Tea: Rice flour is a good material for making almond tea. It is cheap and has high nutritional value. Buy half a catty of rice flour, five cents worth of dried almonds (sweet ones), and a little white sugar. First, soak the almonds in boiling water for a while, peel off the outer skin, put them in a pot, add two bowls of water, and boil for twenty minutes; then add three or four bowls of water and bring to a boil.

    Then, mix the rice flour with cold water into a paste, pour it into the almond water, and stir constantly with a spoon until it boils into a paste. Add some white sugar, and the almond tea is ready. This pot of almond tea can serve five or six people.

    Shredded Radish Cakes: Buy half a catty of white radish, two taels of peanut oil, sesame seeds (one jiao's worth), half a catty of white flour, chopped green onions, and a little white sugar and salt.

    Instructions: Mix the white flour with oil and water (one and a half taels of oil and some cold water), then roll the dough into a sheet; fold it up and roll it into a sheet again; fold it up again and roll it again; repeat three to four times, and finally roll the large sheet of dough into a cylinder and cut it into sixteen dough pieces.

    Peel the white radish and shred it, stir-fry it in an oil pan for a while, add some green onions and salt, and then take it out to make the filling.

    Roll the cut dough pieces into thin skins, wrap the filling, and press them into cakes with your hands. Brush a layer of sugar water on the surface of the cake and sprinkle with sesame seeds. At this time, heat the pan for making pancakes, first bake the side with sesame seeds until the sesame seeds turn yellow, then turn it over and bake for about ten minutes until cooked. The heat should not be too high when baking. Zhong Huashu

    元旦的早点
    元旦日的早晨，全家人围着桌子坐下，喝一碗热腾腾的杏仁茶，吃几个萝卜丝饼，这既不用多花钱，又很有新年的气氛。
    现在把杏仁茶和萝卜丝饼的做法介绍如下：
    杏仁茶　大米面是做杏仁茶的很好的材料，价钱便宜，营养价值也高。买米面半斤、五分钱的干杏仁（甜的）和少许白糖。先把杏仁用开水泡一会，将外皮剥下，放在锅内，加水二碗，煮二十分钟；再加水三、四碗，煮开。
    然后把米面用凉水调成糊状，倒入杏仁水内，用勺不断地搅，直到开锅成糊状，加一些白糖，杏仁茶就做好了。这一锅杏仁茶可供五、六人食用。
    萝卜丝饼　买白萝卜半斤、花生油二两、芝麻（一角）、白面半斤、葱花及白糖、盐少许。
    做法：将白面用油和水和好（油一两半并加一些凉水），然后将面赶成片状；折叠起来，再赶成片状；再折叠起来，再赶；往返三到四次，最后将大面片卷成筒状，切成十六份面剂。
    将白萝卜去皮擦成丝，放在油锅炒一会，加一些葱和盐，即可取出做馅。
    将已切好之面剂赶成薄皮，将馅包好，用手压成饼状。在饼上面刷一层白糖水，洒点芝麻。这时将烙饼的锅烧热，先烙有芝麻的一面，等芝麻发黄色再翻过来烙，约十几分钟即可熟。烙时底火不要太旺。　钟华淑
