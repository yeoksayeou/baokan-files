Parks in Budapest

　　Budapest now has more than five hundred parks. Some of them are very large, such as the City Park and the park on Margaret Island. The children of Budapest will not feel that there is nowhere to play, and lovers and old people will not feel that there is nowhere to stroll and rest. However, the counter-revolutionary rebellion last October left traces on Budapest's parks. The restoration work of the parks cost nearly two million forints. Gardeners planted nearly 900,000 annual flowers in the park, and the damaged benches were also restored. The most popular park chairs in the past are now arranged along the boulevards of Margaret Island, in the City Park, Tchaikovsky Park, and the park near the National Museum.

    布达佩斯的公园
    布达佩斯现在有五百多个公园。其中有一些是规模很大的公园，如市立公园、玛尔吉特岛上的公园。布达佩斯的孩子们也不会感到无处可玩了，恋人们和老年人也不会感到无处可散步和休息了。可是，去年十月反革命暴乱却给布达佩斯的公园留下了痕迹。公园的恢复工作差不多花费了两百万福林。花匠们在公园里种植了近九十万棵一年生的花木，毁坏了的长凳也恢复起来。从前最受人欢迎的公园里的圈椅，现在沿着玛尔吉特岛的林荫道上，在市立公园、柴可夫斯基公园、国立博物馆附近的公园里又布置起来了。
