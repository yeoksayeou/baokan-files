　　Discussing the Outline for Agricultural Development
　　Always Ready to Support Agriculture
　　The faculty, staff, and students of the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics recently discussed the revised draft of the Outline for Agricultural Development.
　　During the discussion, everyone further recognized the important role of agriculture in socialist construction. Many people examined their own ideas of underestimating agriculture and agricultural labor. Through the discussion, many realized that the reason for the erroneous idea of underestimating agricultural labor was due to being detached from labor and not integrating well with workers and peasants. To change this situation and become a true intellectual of the working class, one must be tempered through labor. Through the discussion, everyone saw the future of rural development and were willing to contribute their efforts to the implementation of the revised draft of the Outline for Agricultural Development. They expressed their readiness to respond to the call of the motherland at any time and go to the countryside to support agricultural construction. The students of the first department proposed to save food and not waste a single grain of rice or vegetable; they would use their vacations to participate in agricultural labor to help cooperatives. The students of the second department proposed launching a "letter campaign" to encourage their relatives and friends to concentrate on agricultural production. The students of the third department proposed to lower food standards and eat coarse grains; to be careful to protect crops when walking; and to achieve "four lights and three no leftovers" when eating (bowl light, plate light, ground light, table light; no leftover rice, no leftover vegetables, no leftover soup); teachers of basic courses expressed their active participation in voluntary labor, using fewer temporary workers, and reducing state expenditures.
　　Strengthened Determination to Go to the Countryside and Mountains
　　Faculty, staff, and students of the Beijing Railway Institute enthusiastically discussed the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program item by item.
　　During the discussion, everyone unanimously agreed that the National Agricultural Development Program is a great program for building a socialist countryside, and it is also closely related to people of all strata in the city. Everyone believed that through the discussion of this great program, they further recognized the socialist development direction of the countryside, thereby strengthening their determination and confidence in requesting to go to the countryside and mountains.
　　During the discussion, many people criticized the idea of ​​ignoring agriculture and looking down on farmers. Ma Yuanming of the Physics Teaching and Research Section said, "Our food and clothing are provided by the farmers; the farmers are our parents in terms of food and clothing; but we despise the farmers and think that agricultural labor is nothing. On the contrary, we often say how great our contributions are without remembering where the water comes from. This idea is too sorry for the working people." He Jibing of the Telecommunications Department said, "Looking down on farmers is the ideology of the exploiting class left over from the old society."
　　In the discussion, many students first criticized their past erroneous attitude of only knowing how to open their mouths for food and reach out for clothes, despising labor, especially agricultural labor. Some students also criticized that in the past, they only talked about the interdependence of industry and agriculture and that both were important, but in action and thought, they showed contempt for agricultural labor. More students criticized the erroneous idea of ​​only aspiring to engage in industrial production and never considering going to rural areas to work in the future.
　　After these days of study and discussion, everyone further recognized the beautiful prospects of the socialist countryside. Many people also enthusiastically expressed or reiterated their determination to be demobilized and contribute their strength to the realization of this great program.
　　To Contribute to Increased Production Targets
　　The faculty, staff, and students of Beijing Agricultural University conducted a serious discussion on the Outline for Agricultural Development.
　　During the discussion, everyone pointed out the close relationship between the forty articles of the Outline for Agricultural Development and the agricultural university. Vice President Shen Qiyi, Professor Xiong Dashi, and Professor Shen Jun all made suggestions on the issue of combining teaching and scientific research work well with farm production. Many teachers also expressed their opinions in conjunction with their teaching and scientific research work. For example, Professor Sun Qu of the Agronomy Department said: In the future, in the teaching of cultivation science, it is necessary to break the past restrictions, and reorganize the teaching content and research work according to the spirit of the outline. Professor Ye Hecai of the Soil and Agricultural Chemistry Department said: The wisdom of our working people is also fully reflected in mobilizing mass-based water conservancy projects, such as the "Two Immortals Passing on the Tao" and "Three Immortals Passing on the Tao" methods created by farmers in Shaanxi to solve the problem of irrigation in mountainous areas. He expressed that he would connect these practical problems in future teaching and scientific research work. Professor Peng Keming believes that although the country is now vigorously increasing the production of inorganic chemical fertilizers, we must still simultaneously increase the amount of organic fertilizers and should still focus on organic fertilizers. During the discussion, some teachers also made suggestions on the work of the school. For example, some teachers in the Agronomy Department suggested that the spirit of the outline should be used to examine the school's teaching and scientific research work, formulate plans, and further organize scientific research forces to better contribute to the completion of the increased production targets stipulated in the outline.

　　讨论农业发展纲要
    随时准备支援农业
    北京航空学院师生员工在最近讨论了农业发展纲要修正草案。
    在讨论中，大家都进一步认识了农业在社会主义建设中的重要作用。不少人检查了自己的轻视农业、轻视农业劳动的思想。通过讨论，许多人认识到产生轻视农业劳动错误思想的原因是由于脱离劳动，没有很好地和工农相结合的缘故。要改变这种状况，使自己成一个真正的工人阶级知识分子，必须到劳动中去锻炼。通过讨论，大家看到了农村发展的远景，都愿意为实现农业发展纲要修正草案尽自己的一份力量，纷纷表示准备随时响应祖国的号召，到农村去支援农业建设。一系同学提出要节约粮食，不浪费一米一菜；利用假期参加农业劳动来帮助合作社。二系同学提出发起“一封信运动”鼓励自己的亲友安心农业生产。三系同学提出要求降低伙食标准，改吃粗粮；走路时注意保护庄稼；吃饭时做到“四光三不剩”（碗光、碟光、地光、桌光；不剩饭、不剩菜、不剩汤）；基础课教师表示积极参加义务劳动，少用临时工，减少国家开支。
　  坚定了下乡上山的决心
    北京铁道学院师生员工热烈地逐条讨论了全国农业发展纲要修正草案。
    在讨论中，大家一致认为：全国农业发展纲要是建设社会主义农村的伟大纲领，它和城市各阶层人民也有着密切的关系。大家认为：通过对这个伟大纲领的讨论，进一步认清了农村的社会主义发展方向，从而更加坚定了大家要求下乡、上山的决心和信心。
    在讨论中，不少人批判了忽视农业、看不起农民的思想。物理教研组马元明说：“我们的衣食都是农民供给的，农民是我们的衣食父母；可是却轻视农民，觉得农业劳动无所谓，相反，我们往往把自己说得有多大贡献而不饮水思源，这种想法真太对不起劳动人民了。”电信系何积炳说：“看不起农民，是旧社会遗留下来的剥削阶级思想。”
    不少同学在讨论中，首先批判了自己过去只知道饭来张口，衣来伸手，轻视劳动，特别是轻视农业劳动的错误态度，有的同学也批判了过去只在口头上讲工农业是相互依赖，都很重要，但在行动上和思想上却表现出对农业劳动的轻视，更多的同学批判了过去只一心向往着搞工业生产，根本没有考虑过将来去农村劳动的错误思想。
    经过这几天来的学习和讨论，大家进一步认清了社会主义农村的美好远景，很多人还热情地表示或重申了自己要求下放的决心，要为实现这一伟大纲领献出自己的力量。
  　要为增产指标做出贡献
    北京农业大学全校师生员工对农业发展纲要进行了认真的讨论。
    在讨论的过程中，大家都指出农业发展纲要四十条和农业大学的密切关系。沈其益副校长、熊大仕教授、沈隽教授都针对教学和科学研究工作要很好地和农场生产结合的问题提出了建议。许多教师并且结合着自己的教学和科学研究工作发表了意见。如农学系教授孙渠说：今后在耕作学的教学上，要打破过去的限制，根据纲要的精神要重新组织教学内容和研究工作。土壤农化系叶和才教授说：在发动群众性的兴修水利中，也充分体现了我国劳动人民的智慧，例如陕西农民创造的“二仙传道”、“三仙传道”的方法来解决山区灌溉的问题等等。他表示在今后的教学和科学研究工作中要联系这些实际问题。彭克明教授认为国家现在虽然正在大力增产无机化学肥料，但是我们仍必须同时以增加大量有机肥料，仍应该以有机肥料为主。在讨论的过程中有些教师还对学校的工作提出了建议。如农学系有的教师建议以纲要的精神检查全校教学和科学研究工作，订出规划，进一步把科学研究力量组织起来，更好地为完成纲要中规定的增产指标做出贡献。
