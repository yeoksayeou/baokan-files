    In the harsh winter, when the surrounding scenery becomes desolate, if you keep a few pots of flowers indoors, the green branches and leaves will bloom with bright flowers, not only filling the room with the breath of spring, but also making life more rich and colorful!
    In winter, the most common potted flowers are poinsettias, freesias, and daffodils. In terms of the flowers' elegance, the fragrance's delicacy, the posture's gracefulness, and the length of the flowering period and the ease of cultivation, the daffodil ranks first.
    Daffodils have a long history of cultivation in China. People in the Six Dynasties took the daffodil's head to be shaped like a garlic bulb, and once called it "elegant garlic"; the old folks in the Wudang Mountain valley took its stem to be hollow like a scallion, and once called it "heavenly scallion"; and ancient literati and poets mostly took its simplicity, light posture, and plainness, like a water sprite, and once called it "elegant guest."
    According to ancient books, daffodil varieties used to be called "narcissus" for single-petal varieties and "yu linglong" for double-petal varieties. But there is also a double-petal variety with curled petals, light yellow below and light white above, and the flower shape is not cup-shaped, called "true daffodil," which the ancients liked the most. But some people think that the single-petal variety produced in Jiading, with short leaves and tall flowers, is the best variety. In modern times, due to the import of foreign daffodils, the varieties have become richer.
    Daffodils prefer moist air and a warm climate. They cannot lack water, nor can they be immersed in water. Therefore, the low, damp places on both sides of rivers, with sandy soil, are the most ideal places for them to grow.
    To grow daffodils at home, you only need to buy a daffodil bulb from a flower shop. A large daffodil bulb has about three to five "arrows" (buds) inside. Each arrow draws a stem, and each stem blooms with several flowers. The larger the daffodil bulb, the more arrows it has, and the more arrows it has, the more abundant the flowering. After buying the daffodil bulb, you can use a knife to cut a line vertically and horizontally on the top to make it easier for the arrows inside to come out. After cutting, soak it in water for a day, wipe off the poisonous sticky liquid flowing from the cut, and then put it in a shallow pot filled with pebbles (a pot specifically for growing daffodils), and add water until it covers the pebbles. After the roots grow, move it to the window in the sunlight, and change the water once a day thereafter. In a house with a stove, it will bloom in about a month. Although daffodils like a warm climate, when the room temperature is too high and there is not enough sunlight, its branches and leaves grow slender and scattered, and the flower heads are very short and wither quickly. To grow daffodils well, a relatively cool place with sunlight is most suitable. If you add a little salt to the water, the flowers will bloom for a longer time.
    After the flowers wither, cut off the branches and leaves and bury the daffodil bulb with soil. In May of the lunar calendar, dig out the daffodil bulb, soak it in stored urine (three or four days) overnight, then dry it in the sun, and hang it in a warm place near the kitchen. In August or September, replant it in the soil (preferably mixed with pig manure), and it will regrow branches and leaves and bloom again.

    在严寒的冬季，当四外的景色变得十分荒凉时，如果在室内养上几盆花，那绿色的枝叶里吐出鲜艳的花朵，不但满室生春，而且更显得生活丰富多采！
    冬季，最常见的盆花有一品红、香雪兰和水仙花等。按花的莹韵，香气的清幽，姿态的窈袅以及花期的长短与培养的难易来说，水仙花却居第一。
    水仙花在我国栽培历史悠久。六朝人取水仙头像蒜头的形状，曾称它为雅蒜；武当山谷间老乡取它茎干虚通如葱，曾称它为天葱；而古代文人墨客多取它不事铅华，轻姿约素，宛如水中仙子，曾称它为雅客。
    水仙花的品种，按古籍的记述，过去称单瓣的叫水仙，重瓣的叫玉玲珑。但还有一种花瓣卷皱的重瓣，下面轻黄，上面淡白，花形不呈杯状，称为真水仙，古人最欢喜它。但又有人认为嘉定产的单瓣种，叶短花高是最好的品种。近代以来，由于外国水仙的输入，品种更丰富了。
    水仙花性喜空气湿润，气候温暖，它既不能缺水，又不能浸在水中，因此在河流两岸的低湿处，砂性的土质，才是它最理想的生长地方。
    家庭里养水仙花，只要到花店里买个水仙头就行了。大的水仙头，里面约有三、五个“箭”（芽），每个箭抽茎一枝，每茎上开花数朵。水仙头愈大，箭也愈多，箭愈多开花愈盛。买到水仙头以后，可用刀将它上面纵横割开一线，使里面的箭容易钻出来。割后再浸水一天，擦去切口流出的有毒的粘液，再放入装有小石子的浅盆里（专养水仙花的盆），加水至盖满小石子为止。生根后再移放窗前阳光下，以后每天换水一次。在生有火炉的家里，约一月即可开花。水仙花虽喜温暖气候，但室温过高和阳光不足时，它的枝叶长得瘦长而披散，花头很短小，雕谢快。要养好水仙花，以比较冷凉但有阳光照射的地方最为适宜，如水中加上一点儿盐，则花开得时间更长。
    花谢以后，把枝叶剪去，用土将水仙头埋上。在农历5月把水仙头掘出后，用存尿（三四天）浸一夜后晒干，悬挂在靠近厨房暖和的地方。八九月间再栽入土中（最好用猪粪拌土），即可重新长出枝叶和开花。
