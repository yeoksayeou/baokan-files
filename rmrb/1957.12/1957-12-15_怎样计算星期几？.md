How to Calculate the Day of the Week?
　　Hong Qi
    Can you calculate what day of the week next year's "May Day" International Labor Day will fall on without looking at a calendar? Now I will introduce a calculation method that can calculate the day of the week for any day of any year within this century.
    The calculation method is very simple. Its formula is as follows:
    (Month Index + Day of the Month) ÷ 7
    If it can be divided evenly by 7, it is Sunday; if it cannot be divided evenly, the remainder is the day of the week.
   Why divide by 7?
    Because there are seven days in a week. If January 1st is Monday, then to calculate the Sundays in January, we can divide the days of the month by 7. The day that is divisible is Sunday; if it is not divisible, the remainder is the day of the week.
    How is the index obtained?
    January has thirty-one days. After dividing by 7, there are 3 days left. The remaining number is the index for February.
    February has twenty-eight days (twenty-nine days in a leap year). If we add the remaining 3 days from January, February also becomes thirty-one days, and after dividing by 7, there is still a remainder of 3. Therefore, March and February have the same index.
    Now that you know the index calculation method, it is not difficult to calculate the index for each month of each subsequent year. A normal year has three hundred and sixty-five days, which is fifty-two weeks and one day. Therefore, every year that passes, the month index of the following year should increase by 1. For example, the month indices for 1959 are all 1 greater than the indices for 1958. The added number should cycle between 0 and 6. For example, if the index for June in 1958 is 6, the index for June in 1959 should be 0. Since there is a leap year every four years, and a leap year has one more day than the year before it, the month index should be 2 greater than the month index of the previous year after the leap month (referring to February 29th). The following table lists the month indices for recent years to help readers with their calculations. (Attached chart)

　　怎样计算星期几？
　　洪圻
    你能不查日历就算出明年“五一”国际劳动节是星期几吗？现在我向大家介绍一种计算方法，可以算出本世纪内任何一年的任何一日是星期几。
    计算方法很简单，它的公式如下：
    （该月指数＋日数）÷7
    凡能被7除尽的，就是星期日；除不尽的，余数是几，就是星期几。
   为什么要除以7？
    因为一个星期是七天。假如1月1日是星期一，那末我们要算出一月份的星期日是那几天，就可以把日数用7来除，除尽的那天就是星期日；除不尽的，余数是几就是星期几。
    指数是怎样得来的？
    1月是三十一天，除7以后，剩3天。剩下来的数字就是2月份的指数。
    2月份是二十八天（闰年二十九天）。如果把1月份剩下的3天加上，2月份也就成为三十一天，除7以后仍然下余3。因此3月份和2月份的指数相同。
    知道了指数推算方法，要算出以后各年每月的指数就不是难事了。常年每年是三百六十五天，即五十二个星期零一天，因此每过一年，下一年度的月份指数应增加1，像1959年各月指数都比1958年的指数大1。加的数字应以0—6为循环，例如1958年6月份指数是6，1959年6月份的指数应为0。由于每四年有一次闰年，而闰年又比闰年的前一年多一天，所以过了闰月（指2月二十九天）以后，月份指数应较上年度该月份指数多2。下表列出最近几年内的月份指数，以便帮助读者推算时作参考。（附图表）
