    Correctly Treat Individual Farmers

    The State Council has issued the "Instructions on Correctly Treating Individual Farmers," which is a policy measure of great significance in the current rural work. Conscientiously implementing this instruction will greatly help to further consolidate our country's agricultural cooperative system and promote the development of agricultural production and other construction undertakings in rural areas.

    At present, in rural areas of our country, except for a few minority areas where land reform has not yet been carried out, more than 90% of farmers in most areas have joined agricultural production cooperatives, and only about 3% are individual farmers. However, how to correctly treat these individual farmers is still an important principle in rural work. Because the agricultural cooperation was basically completed not long ago, people's attention was focused on consolidating the cooperatives, and the leadership of individual farmers was neglected. Moreover, these individual farmers are extremely scattered, and the work of the Party and the government among them has been greatly weakened in the past two years. Some of these individual farmers originally had more serious capitalist ideas. After the opening of the free market, some areas lacked necessary management, resulting in the emergence of individual farmers engaging in speculative activities, violating the state's unified purchase and sale policies, evading burdens, and even sabotaging cooperatives in many places. This situation has had an adverse impact on the consolidation of cooperatives and the stability of rural order, and should be given due attention.

    What is the situation of these individual farmers? Most of them are wealthy farmers, or semi-merchant and semi-farmer households engaged in commerce, or semi-worker and semi-farmer households engaged in handicrafts, or scattered households living in remote mountains and forests who are temporarily inconvenient to join the cooperative, and a few are poor farmers who lack labor. In addition, there are also some landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries under control, and vagrants who have not been approved to join the cooperative for production. The reason why these individual farmers have not yet joined the cooperative, apart from landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries under control due to political reasons, is partly because they themselves do not believe in the superiority of the agricultural cooperative system, and even harbor resistance.

    Some staff members lack specific analysis of these individual farmers, thinking that since these individual farmers are already few in number, they can be ignored and there is no need to work on them. They do not understand that as long as individual farmers exist, we must firmly and patiently carry out socialist transformation on them, and this is still a task that will take a considerable amount of time to complete. Some comrades seem to have forgotten that the vast majority of collective farmers were still individual farmers two or three years ago, and the current individual farmers are still part of the entire rural residents, and they have various social and historical connections with the vast number of farmers who have joined the cooperatives. Their performance in production activities and other social activities cannot but have a certain impact on the cooperative members. Some farmers with particularly serious capitalist ideas, in order to influence cooperative members, openly claimed to compete with socialist cooperatives and to compete with cooperatives. They are wholeheartedly yearning for capitalism, spreading reactionary capitalist ideas, and even trying to bring down cooperatives. Obviously, their activities that are detrimental to socialism should be regarded as a manifestation of the struggle between the two roads of capitalism and socialism in rural areas. Ignoring this struggle will cause losses. Some individual farmers, especially some wealthy individual households, engage in illegal activities as soon as they see an opportunity. They even made up such complacent ballads: "Going it alone, going it alone, is better than the county magistrate. Public grain is not paid, and grain purchase is owed." Some landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries under control, and other bad elements who have not been allowed to join the cooperative also take the opportunity to carry out sabotage everywhere. Under this circumstance, some cooperative members from well-to-do middle peasant families once showed wavering. The decline of righteousness and the rise of unhealthy trends in some rural areas between spring and summer this year were largely due to this.

    It should be pointed out that the incorrect laissez-faire tendency towards individual farmers needs to be corrected urgently, and some areas have already begun to correct it. However, at the same time, we must continue to oppose another tendency, that is, in some areas, there was a tendency to exclude and discriminate against individual farmers at one time, such as forcing them to join the cooperative, or forcing them to change their cultivated land, etc. Although this tendency is not the main one at present, and some places have already made some corrections, it is necessary to appropriately point out and prevent this tendency from recurring.

    So, how should we treat individual farmers?

    Because individual farmers include different social components and their political situations are different, the principle of differentiated treatment should be implemented first. For individual farmers, our task is to continue to carry out socialist transformation on them. That is to say, on the one hand, we should strengthen unity with them, without discrimination or exclusion; at the same time, we must strengthen ideological education and leadership for them, and strive for them to gradually join the cooperative under the principle of voluntariness. For landlords, rich peasant elements and counter-revolutionaries under control who have not yet changed their social composition, as well as other bad elements, our task is to strengthen their supervision separately, carry out control according to law, and insist on gradually transforming them into self-reliant laborers through labor.

    Based on this principle, in future rural work, the following points should be noted for individual farmers: First, in order to enable individual farmers to receive political and ideological education regularly, to understand government decrees in a timely manner, and to abide by government decrees, all meetings related to them in rural areas, such as residents' meetings, rectification meetings, etc., should be convened for individual farmers to participate. The socialist debate in rural areas should also absorb them to participate. This is a very important opportunity to raise the socialist consciousness of individual farmers, criticize the capitalist ideas of some of them, and expose and crack down on the sabotage activities of certain landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionary elements. At the same time, any useful opinions that may be put forward by individual farmers can also be understood. In addition to this, special meetings of individual farmers can also be convened to explain policies to them, correct their erroneous thoughts and words and deeds, and dispel their concerns about cooperation. In July this year, Baoying County, Jiangsu Province, held a meeting of representatives of individual farmers, where class education was carried out, inspiring them to confide, raise ideological issues, and let everyone debate. On the basis of the majority's improved awareness, the erroneous ideas of wealthy middle peasants were criticized, achieving the purpose of unity (see page 4 of this newspaper on September 19). This is an important experience and worth referring to in various places. Second, in agricultural production, the production of individual farmers should be subject to the state plan, especially in the planting plan, it must be subject to the state's procurement requirements for agricultural products. In market management, appropriate supervision should also be carried out on individual farmers. If they do violate the state's unified purchase and sale regulations, the cooperative, entrusted by the township and town people's governments, should stop them, and when necessary, report to the local government for handling according to law. Third, in terms of state public grain, taxes, and civil construction burdens, individual farmers should bear and pay in accordance with government laws, just like farmers who have joined the cooperative. When the cooperative accepts the government's entrustment to apportion the burdens of individual farmers, it should handle it fairly by referring to the burdens of cooperative farmers, neither favoring nor being too light. Individual farmers who are affected by disasters or are poor should also be reduced or exempted according to law. Fourth, when the cooperative carries out agricultural infrastructure construction, as long as it is a matter that has a direct stake in the production of individual farmers, individual farmers should be mobilized to participate, and they should contribute labor or money accordingly according to the principle of how much they benefit and how much they bear. Fifth, in terms of national rural loans and social relief, appropriate care should be given to individual farmers who are indeed poor, actively helping them to implement mutual assistance in production and promoting the development of their production. Sixth, for landlords, rich peasant elements, counter-revolutionaries under control, and other bad elements who have not been allowed to join the cooperative for production, the township and town people's governments should also, in accordance with the instructions of the State Council, designate relevant cooperatives to effectively supervise and control them and strengthen their transformation.

    After the State Council issued the "Instructions on Correctly Treating Individual Farmers," we hope that the party and government leading organs in various places will, in accordance with the instructions of the State Council, refer to the specific conditions in various places, and effectively strengthen the work of treating individual farmers.

### 正确地对待个体农户

    正确地对待个体农户
    国务院发布了“关于正确对待个体农户的指示”，这是目前农村工作中具有重要意义的一项政策措施。认真地贯彻执行这个指示，将大大地有助于我国农业合作化制度的进一步巩固，有助于农业生产和农村中的其他各种建设事业的发展。
    目前在我国农村中，除了还没有进行土地改革的少数民族地区以外，绝大部分地区的90％以上的农户都参加了农业生产合作社，只有3％左右是个体农户。但是，如何正确地对待这些个体农户，仍然是农村工作中的一个重要的原则问题。由于农业合作化基本完成的时间还不久，人们的注意力集中于巩固合作社方面，忽略了对个体农户的领导，而这些个体农户又极为分散，党和政府在他们中间的工作近两年来是大大减弱了。这些个体农户中一部分人资本主义思想本来比较严重，在自由市场开放以后，某些地区又缺乏必要的管理，以致在不少地方出现了个体农户进行投机活动、违反国家的统购统销政策、逃避负担，甚至对合作社进行破坏的现象。这种情况对合作社的巩固和农村秩序的安定产生了不利的影响，必须给以应有的重视。
    这些个体农户的情况究竟是怎样的呢？他们多数是富裕农民，或者是兼营商贩的半商半农户，或者是兼营手工业的半工半农户，或者是散居深山远林一时不便入社的散居户，也还有少数是缺乏劳动力的贫苦农民。另外，还有一些未被批准入社生产的地主、富农、被管制的反革命分子以及没有正业的游民。这些个体农户其所以尚未入社，除了地主、富农、被管制的反革命分子由于政治的原因以外，其中一部分就是由于他们自己还不相信农业合作制度的优越性，甚至抱有抵触情绪的缘故。
    有些工作人员对于这些个体农户缺乏具体分析，以为既然这些个体农户已经为数很少了，因此就可以不加注意，可以不必对他们进行工作了。他们不了解，只要有个体农户存在，我们就必须坚定地和耐心地对他们进行社会主义改造，而且这还是一个要经过相当长的时间才能完成的任务。有些同志似乎忘记了现在的绝大多数集体农民在两三年前也还是个体农民，现在的个体农民也仍然是整个农村居民的一部分，他们对已经加入了合作社的广大农民有着多方面的社会的历史的联系。他们在生产活动及其他的社会活动上的表现，不可能不对合作社社员产生一定的影响。有些资本主义思想特别严重的农民，为了要影响合作社社员，他们也公然声称要和社会主义的合作社比赛，要和合作社竞争，他们一心向往资本主义，散播资本主义的反动思想，甚至企图把合作社搞垮。显然的，他们的这些不利于社会主义的活动，应该看做是资本主义和社会主义这两条道路斗争在农村中的一种表现。如果忽视这种斗争情况，就会造成损失。某些个体农户，特别是一些富裕的个体户，他们一看到有机可乘，就进行违法活动。他们甚至编出这样得意的歌谣：“单干单干，赛过知县。公粮不交，购粮尾欠。”有些未被允许入社的地主、富农、被管制的反革命分子以及其他坏分子，也到处乘机进行破坏。在这种情况下，合作社内部某些富裕中农出身的社员，曾经一度表现动摇。今年春夏之间部分农村里正气下降、歪风上升，在很大程度上就是由此而来的。
    应该指出，对待个体农户的不正确的自流放任的偏向，是急需纠正的，有些地区已经开始纠正。但是，同时也要继续反对另外一种偏向，这就是在一部分地区有一个时候曾经发生排斥和歧视个体农户的偏向，比如强迫他们入社，或者强迫他们更换耕地等等。这种偏向虽然在目前不是主要的，有些地方也已经有所纠正，但是适当地指出并且防止这种偏向重复发生，也是必要的。
    那末，究竟应该怎样对待个体农户呢？
    由于个体农户，包含的社会成分不同，他们的政治情况不同，因此首先就要实行区别对待的原则。对于个体农民，我们的任务，是要对他们继续实行社会主义的改造。这就是说，一方面对于他们应该加强团结，不加歧视，不加排斥；同时又必须对他们加强思想教育，加强领导，并争取他们在自愿原则下逐步地加入合作社。对于尚未改变社会成份的地主、富农分子和被管制的反革命分子以及其他坏分子，我们的任务，就是要分别地加强对他们的监督，依法进行管制，坚持使他们在劳动中逐步改造成为自食其力的劳动者。
    根据这样的原则，今后在农村的各项工作上，对于个体农户，应注意以下几点：第一，为了使个体农户能够经常受到政治思想教育，能够及时了解政府法令，遵守政府法令，农村中一切和他们有关的会议，如居民会议、整风会议等应该召集个体农户参加。农村的社会主义大辩论更应该吸收他们参加。这对于提高个体农户的社会主义觉悟，批判他们中间某些人的资本主义思想，揭露和打击某些地主、富农、反革命分子的破坏活动，是一个很重要的机会。同时，对于个体农户中可能提出的一切有益的意见，也可以从而得到了解。除此以外，还可以召集专门的个体农户的会议，通过这种会议向他们解释政策，纠正他们的错误的思想言行，解除他们对于合作化的顾虑。在今年7月间，江苏宝应县就召开了一次个体农民代表会议，会上进行了阶级教育，启发他们谈心，提出思想问题，让大家进行辩论。在多数人觉悟提高的基础上，批判了富裕中农的错误思想，达到了团结的目的（见9月19日本报四版）。这是一个重要的经验，值得各地参考。第二，在农业生产上，应该使个体农户的生产，服从国家计划，特别是在种植计划上必须服从国家农产品的征购要求。在市场管理上，也应该对个体农户进行适当的监督。如果他们确实违反国家统购统销的规定，合作社受乡、镇人民政府的委托，就应该加以制止，必要的时候应该报告当地政府依法处理。第三，在国家公粮、税收、民工建勤等负担上，个体农民都应按照政府的法令，同入社的农户一样地负担和缴纳。合作社在接受政府委托分摊个体农户的负担的时候，应该比照合作社农户的负担，公平处理，既不偏重，也不偏轻。受灾的或者贫困的个体农户，也应该依法减免。第四，合作社在进行农业基本建设的时候，只要是对于个体农户在生产上有直接利害关系的事情，就都应该动员个体农户参加，并且应该按照他们受益多少、负担多少的原则，相应地出工或出钱。第五，在国家的农村贷款和社会救济方面，对于确实贫困的个体农户，应该给予适当照顾，积极帮他们在生产上实行互助，促使他们的生产能够得到发展。第六，对于尚未被准许入社参加生产的地主、富农、被管制的反革命分子以及其他坏分子，乡、镇人民政府也应该按照国务院的指示，指定有关的合作社，切实加以监督和管制，加强对他们的改造。
    在国务院发布了“关于正确对待个体农户的指示”以后，我们希望各地党政领导机关，按照国务院的指示，参照各地具体情况，有效地把对待个体农户的工作加强起来。
