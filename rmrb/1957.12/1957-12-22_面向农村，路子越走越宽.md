Facing the Countryside, the Road Gets Wider and Wider
　　Liu Ruman, Shen Fumin

　　Days of Distress

　　From the end of 1955 to the beginning of 1956, the United Processing Factory in Qin County, Shanxi Province, underwent a production reorganization: it was decentralized from the original special district management to county management; and it changed from operating only egg products to operating multiple businesses such as power generation, agricultural tool repair, granular fertilizer, oil extraction, flour milling, and printing.

　　At that time, the purpose of implementing production reorganization was originally to better serve local agricultural production directly. However, the leaders and some employees of this factory did not quickly change their service concept. They always looked outward and not inward; they preferred to do fixed work rather than odd jobs; they preferred to manufacture rather than repair; they preferred to do big jobs rather than small, scattered jobs; they preferred to produce machines rather than repair agricultural tools; they preferred to do ready-made work rather than try out new products; they preferred to align with large-scale industry rather than serve agriculture. In terms of product sales, they only hoped for higher-level sales and were unwilling to deal directly with farmers. Some people also mistakenly believed that farmers had low purchasing power, not much capital, and a small rural market. There was nothing to do to serve agricultural production, and local industry had no future. As a result, they couldn't do big jobs and looked down on small jobs, and production was often in a state of "starvation." Last year, there were 4,284 production stoppage days, which is equivalent to the current 104 workers in the factory not producing for 41 days. There was no money to buy materials, wages could not be paid at the end of the month, and more than 60,000 yuan of loans were owed to the bank. From May of last year to March of this year, in the 11 months, 87,688 yuan was lost. As a result, the thinking of the employees was chaotic: cadres asked to be transferred to other jobs, workers asked to transfer to other factories, and individual leading cadres also said: "It's not good to do business that loses money, it will have to be shut down sooner or later, it's better to leave early, if you want to do it, go to a big factory or mine."

　　Finding a Way Out

　　Just when they were at their wits' end, in February of this year, the Changzhi Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party clearly put forward the operating policy for county-run enterprises: "Take materials locally, process them locally, do both wholesale and retail jobs, actively serve the rural economy, face the countryside, face the market, and produce products urgently needed by the people to meet the production and living needs of the broad masses of the people." The county party committee also proposed: to go all out to support agricultural production.

　　Comparing the instructions of the higher-level party committee with the actual situation of the factory, the leaders of the factory began to become clear-headed. They examined and criticized the mistakes of deviating from the countryside and the needs of the market in their operating policies, and began to clearly establish the concept of serving the rural economy. This spring, when the county held a three-level expanded cadre meeting and professional meetings such as agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, and animal husbandry, the factory invited more than 4,000 people to visit the factory, understand the urgent needs of farmers, and listen to many suggestions for improving work. Subsequently, the factory organized seven visiting groups consisting of party and government leading cadres and technical workers, who visited 21 townships and 181 agricultural cooperatives in four batches, and learned about many problems that urgently needed to be solved in the countryside but could not be solved by farmers. For example, Guo Village, Nanren, and eight other townships had more than 40 new-style walking plows, which became "hanging plows" because the parts were broken and could not be repaired; 25 waterwheels could not be installed for more than a year; after agricultural cooperation, farmers' demands greatly increased, such as developing water conservancy requiring water conservancy tools, opening up fertilizer sources to increase yield per unit area, and supplying pig feed substitutes after the development of pig raising, and so on.

　　Through the visits, they signed agreements with 17 agricultural cooperatives to install and guarantee the repair of boiler-locomotives, diesel engines, waterwheels, and double-share plows, and signed contracts with 279 agricultural cooperatives to process 700,000 jin of horse feed and 2,580 jin of wild oilseeds... At the same time, they undertook the mechanical equipment for the Yingchun River Reservoir and the Houquan Hydropower Station. These facts all show that serving the countryside is not something that there is nothing to do, but rather there is more and more to do; for local industry, only by truly facing the countryside is the correct path to development.

　　Becoming Good Friends of Farmers

　　After understanding the needs of the countryside, the factory concentrated all its efforts on serving agricultural production. Their slogan was: "Go all out to support agricultural production." The method was: "Production is combined with the rural market, invention and creation are combined with the practical experience of old farmers, and the trial production of new products is combined with the needs of the local people."

　　In terms of water conservancy: The Yingchun River Reservoir project required drilling from the beginning, but large-scale drilling was not needed, and there were no tools for small-scale drilling. The factory created a small hand-cranked formation drill that could drill ten meters deep based on the principle of the drilling machine. Six people could drill 40 meters a day. The first step of the project was solved in this way. What followed was that the accumulated water could not be discharged, and the migrant workers could not operate. The factory selected four technical workers to live on the construction site for a long time and drain water day and night with machines to ensure the smooth progress of excavation and embankment construction. They also made a three-ton stone roller with ball bearings, which could compact 8,000 square meters of embankment a day, increasing efficiency by 13 times compared to manual labor. In early May, the project entered a tense stage, and the migrant workers were crowded and unable to complete the work. They selected three welding workers to install the 7.5 kW generator in the factory on the construction site. With electric lights on the construction site, the construction was changed to two shifts day and night, which resulted in the completion of the project one month ahead of schedule. However, the most arduous task in the construction of the reservoir was the manufacture of mechanical equipment to control and regulate the amount of water. They selected nine technical workers to form a research and trial production team, and sent people to visit the Changzhi Xingfu Reservoir. After three months of hard work, they finally succeeded in trial-producing a complete set of mechanical equipment such as a four-ton gate-lifting machine and a high-pressure sluice gate in late June of this year. On July 21, the reservoir began to release water, just in time for the needs of drought resistance and seedling protection. As a result, the autumn grain yield per mu in the four villages around the reservoir increased by 61 jin, and they achieved the first year's bumper harvest. The farmers praised: "The unity of workers and peasants is of one heart, and man will surely conquer nature."

　　The factory also helped farmers build a small hydropower station in Houquan. Except for the motor, the entire mechanical equipment such as water turbines, water turbine switches, and gate-lifting machines were all manufactured by the factory. 116 households in Houquan and Manshui villages, as well as supply and marketing cooperatives and schools, turned on electric lights on September 15. Two small steel mills were also installed near the hydropower station to process grain for farmers, which can replace more than 15,000 man-hours and animal power a year and put them into agricultural production. The farmers said excitedly: "We are not worried about drought, we don't need oil to light the lamps, and we don't need donkeys and cattle to grind flour."

　　In terms of fertilizer: The factory used local peat mixed with chemical fertilizers to make a granular fertilizer; and used nitrate soil and wood ash to make a brine fertilizer. This year, they have supplied 110 tons of granular fertilizer and 15,000 jin of brine fertilizer to agricultural production. According to the actual use results of the county's farm and five agricultural cooperatives, each jin of granular fertilizer is equal to one dan of local fertilizer.

　　In addition, they have successfully trial-produced corn cob grinders to help farmers solve the problem of expanding pig feed; trial-produced small power steel mills, rice milling machines, wheat screening machines and other small machinery, saving farmers manpower and animal power in miscellaneous labor; and at the same time, repaired a large number of agricultural machinery for farmers. All of these have been warmly welcomed by the farmers.

　　Unlimitedly Good Prospects

　　Due to the conscientious implementation of the policy of serving the rural economy, the factory has not only powerfully supported agricultural production, but also greatly changed the face of the enterprise. The production task has changed from the original "not enough to eat" to "cannot finish eating"; from losing money every month in the past to having a surplus every month. In the past six months, they have successfully trial-produced 45 new products, of which 28 are directly for agricultural production. The variety of products has increased from 13 in July of this year to 94. If the output value is 100 last year, it has been expanded to 166.58% this year, and labor productivity has increased by 73.59% compared with last year. All employees have also realized from practice that local industry does not have no future, but has unlimitedly beautiful development prospects.

　　With the advent of a new upsurge in rural production and construction, the enthusiasm of the factory's employees to support agriculture has become even higher. Now they are further improving technology, improving enterprise management, and carrying out an increase production and practice economy movement, striving to better assist the peasant brothers in building a new socialist countryside.

    面向农村，路子越走越宽

    苦闷的日子
    1955年底到1956年初，山西省沁县联合加工厂进行了生产改组：由原来的专区经营下放为县营；由经营蛋品一种业务转为经营发电、农具修配、颗粒肥料、榨油、磨面、印刷等多种业务。
    当时实行生产改组的目的，本来是为了更好地直接为当地农业生产服务。但是，这个厂的领导人员和部分职工在服务观点上却没有很快扭过来，总是向外看，不向内看；愿做固定活，不愿做杂活；愿制造，不愿修理；愿做大活，不愿做零星活；愿生产机器，不愿修理农具；愿做现成活，不愿试制新产品；愿向大工业看齐，不愿为农业服务。在产品销售方面，也只希望上级包销，而不愿意直接同农民打交道。有的人还错误地认为农民购买力低，资金不多，农村市场狭小，为农业生产服务没啥可干，地方工业没有前途。结果大活干不了，小活看不起，生产上经常处于“挨饿”状态。去年一年生产停工日有四千二百八十四个，等于现在全厂一百零四个工人四十一天没有生产。买材料没有资金，月终发不了工资，欠下银行六万多元贷款；从去年5月到今年3月的十一个月中间，赔钱八万七千六百八十八元。这样一来，职工思想混乱了：干部要求调动工作，工人要求转厂，个别领导干部也说：“赔钱买卖不好干，迟早得收摊，不如早点走了好，要干就到大厂矿。”
    找到了出路
    正当走头无路的时候，今年2月间，中共长治地委工业会议明确提出了县营企业的经营方针：“就地取材、就地加工，既做整批大活，又做零星小活，要积极为农村经济服务，面向农村，面向市场，生产人民群众急需的产品，满足广大人民群众生产和生活上的需要。”县委也提出：要全力以赴，支援农业生产。
    把上级党委的指示拿来同本厂的实际情况一对照，这个厂的领导人员的头脑开始清醒了。他们检查和批判了在经营方针上脱离农村、脱离市场需要的错误，开始明确树立了为农村经济服务的观点。今年春天，县里召开三级扩大干部会和农林水牧等专业会议的时候，这个厂邀请了四千多个人到厂里参观，了解了农民的迫切要求，听取了许多改进工作意见。随后，这个厂由党政领导干部和技术工人组织了七个访问组，先后四次到二十一个乡、一百八十一个农业社进行了调查访问，在访问中了解到许多农村中急待解决而农民又无法解决的问题。例如，郭村、南仁等八个乡有四十多部新式步犁，因为零件坏了不会修理，成了“挂犁”；二十五部水车有一年多安装不起来；农业合作化以后，农民的要求大大增加，如开发水利要求水利工具，为了提高单位面积产量，要求开辟肥料来源，养猪事业发展以后要求供应猪饲料代用品，等等。
    通过访问，他们同十七个农业社订立了安装、包修锅驼机、柴油机、水车、双铧犁的协议，同二百七十九个农业社订立了七十万斤马料和二千五百八十斤野生油料的加工合同……同时承揽了迎春河水库和后泉水力发电站两项工程的机械设备。这些事实都说明，为农村服务并不是没啥可干，而是有越来越多的活；对于地方工业来说，也只有真正面向农村，才是正确的发展途径。
    成了农民的好朋友
    在了解了农村的需要以后，这个厂就把全部力量集中到为农业生产服务方面来了。他们的口号是：“全力以赴支援农业生产”。办法是：“生产同农村市场相结合，创造发明同老农实际经验相结合，新产品试制同当地群众的需要相结合”。
    在水利方面：迎春河水库工程开始就需要钻探，但是大规模钻探不需要，小型钻探没有工具。这个厂就根据钻探机的原理，创造了一种能钻十公尺深的小型手搬地层钻，六个人一天能钻四十公尺。工程第一步困难就这样解决了。接着而来的是积水排不出去，民工无法操作。这个厂就抽出四个技术工人，长时间住在工地，用机器日夜排水，保证了挖土筑堤的顺利进行。他们还制成了一个三吨重、带有滚珠的大石滚，一天可夯堤八千平方公尺，比人工提高效率十三倍多。5月上旬工程进入紧张阶段，民工拥挤赶不出活来，他们便抽出三个电焊工人，把厂内七点五瓩的发电机在工地安装起来。工地上有了电灯，施工改为日夜两班，结果使工程提前一个月完成。但是，水库建设中的一项最艰巨的任务，是制造控制和调节水量的机械设备。他们抽出九个技术工人组成研究试制小组，并派人到长治幸福水库参观。经过三个月的苦心钻研，终于在今年6月下旬把四吨重的起闸机、高压水闸等全套机械设备试制成功。7月21日，水库开始放水，正赶上抗旱保苗需要用水灌溉田地。结果，水库周围四个村庄的秋粮每亩增产六十一斤，获得了第一年的大丰收。农民们称赞说：“工农团结一条心，人定胜天有保证。”
    这个厂还在后泉帮助农民建起一座小型水力发电站。除电机以外，整个机械设备如水轮机、水轮开关、起闸机等都是这个厂制造的。后泉、漫水两个村庄一百一十六户农民以及供销社、学校等都在9月15日点上了电灯。水电站附近还安装起了两部小钢磨，代农民加工粮食，一年就可以顶替下一万五千多个人力和畜力，投入农业生产。农民们兴奋地说：“天旱不发愁，点灯不用油，磨面不用驴和牛。”
    在肥料方面：这个厂利用当地的泥炭配上化学肥料，制造成一种颗粒肥料；利用硝土和柴灰，制造成卤水肥料。今年他们已经供应到农业生产上的颗粒肥料有一百一十吨，卤水肥料有一万五千斤。据这个县的农场和五个农业社实际使用的结果，每斤颗粒肥料等于一石土肥。
    此外，他们还试制成功了玉米轴磨粉机，帮助农民解决了扩大猪饲料的问题；试制成动力小钢磨、碾米机、筛麦机等小型机械，节省了农民在杂务劳动方面的人力和畜力；同时为农民修理了大批农业机械。这都受到了农民的热烈欢迎。
    前途无限好
    由于认真执行了为农村经济服务的方针，这个厂不但有力地支援了农业生产，企业的面貌也有了很大改变。生产任务由原来的“吃不饱”，变成了“吃不了”；由过去月月赔钱，变成了月月盈余。半年来，他们已经试制成功了四十五种新产品，其中直接为农业生产服务的有二十八种。产品品种由今年7月的十三种增加到九十四种。产值如以去年为一百，今年已扩大为166.58％，劳动生产率比去年提高了73.59％。全体职工也从实践中体会到，地方工业不是没有前途，而是有无限美好的发展远景。
    随着农村新的生产建设高潮的到来，这个厂的职工支援农业的热情更加高涨。现在他们正在进一步提高技术，改进企业管理，开展增产节约运动，争取更好地协助农民兄弟建设社会主义的新农村。
