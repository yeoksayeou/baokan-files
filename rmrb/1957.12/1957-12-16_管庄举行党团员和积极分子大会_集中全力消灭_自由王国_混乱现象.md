Xinhua News Agency, Guanzhuang, December 14th: The Party Committee of the Ministry of Building Materials Industry's Guanzhuang Design Bureau held a meeting this afternoon of over 1,200 Party members, League members, and activists, mobilizing Party members to take the lead in deeply airing views and vigorously rectifying, striving to thoroughly eliminate the "free kingdom"—the chaotic phenomena in Guanzhuang.

    Su Jiguang, Secretary of the Design Bureau Party Committee, delivered a mobilization report at the meeting. He said, "The 'free kingdom' is not good, it is incompatible with socialism; but it is good that the 'free kingdom' has been exposed. We not only have the courage to face this shortcoming squarely, but also have the determination and confidence to overcome it. With the leadership and support of the five-person working group sent by the State Council, our confidence is even higher, and we will concentrate all our efforts to fight for the elimination of the 'free kingdom' with a revolutionary spirit."

    Su Jiguang said that the leaders of the ministry also attach great importance to the problems in Guanzhuang. Not long ago, they sent people to Guanzhuang to establish a unified administrative leadership organization—the Design Bureau, and established a temporary Party Committee, and are currently strengthening the work of Party and administrative leadership.

    When Su Jiguang spoke about the situation of airing views and general rectification in the previous stage, he said that although certain achievements have been made, there are still areas that are not deep or thorough enough, and it is necessary to further mobilize the masses to deeply air views and continue to vigorously rectify. He said that the current work is: First, to check the work of airing views and rectification in the previous stage, how much has been changed, and what problems still exist; second, to deeply air views. Focus on the tendency of neglecting politics and the serious departmentalism that exists in various units, and conduct thorough airing of views. Regarding the relaxation of labor discipline, violations of laws and discipline, and aspects of production and business, those that have not been thoroughly aired should continue to be aired; third, regarding the issue of public security, start with household registration, and conduct a household registration throughout Guanzhuang in the near future; fourth, regarding the issue of material supply, it is necessary to find out the situation of material supply and establish a unified supply relationship; fifth, carry out a campaign to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene throughout Guanzhuang to give the environment of Guanzhuang a new look.

    Zeng Yifan, Deputy Secretary-General of the State Council and leader of the five-person working group, also spoke at the meeting. He said that everyone's big-character posters expressing warm welcome to the working group are a manifestation of their high trust and support for the Party and the government. Zeng Yifan said that the State Council attaches great importance to the Guanzhuang issue. Because the Guanzhuang issue is not simply a Guanzhuang issue, it has considerable universal significance for the whole country. The State Council decided to send a five-person working group, determined to solve the Guanzhuang issue and draw experience and lessons from solving the Guanzhuang issue.

    Zeng Yifan said that under the leadership of the State Council and the Ministry of Building Materials Industry, our working group will assist the Guanzhuang Party Committee, closely rely on Party members, League members, activists, and the broad masses, and will certainly be able to thoroughly solve the problem of the "free kingdom"—Guanzhuang.

    Finally, Xu Yaosan, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of the Ministry of Building Materials Industry, called on every Party member and League member to take the lead in taking immediate action, mobilizing the broad masses, deeply airing views, and bravely exposing problems, and to rectify Guanzhuang well.

    管庄举行党团员和积极分子大会
    集中全力消灭“自由王国”混乱现象
    新华社管庄14日电　中共建筑材料工业部驻管庄设计管理局党委会，今天下午召开了一千二百多人的党、团员、积极分子大会，动员党团员带头深入鸣放，继续大力整改，为彻底消灭“自由王国”——管庄的混乱现象而奋斗。
    设计管理局党委书记苏继光在会上作了动员报告。他说，“自由王国”是不好的，这是和社会主义不相容的；但是“自由王国”被揭发出来，这是好的。我们不但有勇气来正视这个缺点，而且有决心、有信心来克服这个缺点。在国务院派来的五人工作组的领导和支持下，我们的信心更高，我们要集中全力以革命的精神为消灭“自由王国”而奋斗。
    苏继光说，部的领导也很重视管庄的问题，不久前，曾派人来管庄成立了统一的行政领导机构——设计管理局，成立了临时党委会，目前正在加强党和行政领导的工作。
    苏继光讲到前一阶段鸣放和一般整改的情况时说，虽然取得了一定的成绩，但是也还有不深不透之处，需要进一步发动群众深入鸣放，继续大力整改。他说当前的工作是：第一，要检查一下前一阶段鸣放和整改的工作，究竟改了多少，还存在什么问题；第二，要深入鸣放。抓住忽视政治的倾向和各单位存在的严重的本位主义两大重点，进行彻底的鸣放，关于劳动纪律松弛、违法乱纪和生产业务等方面凡是鸣放不透的也要继续鸣放；第三，关于治安问题，先从户口登记入手，在最近期内全管庄进行一次户口登记；第四，关于物资供应问题，要摸清物资供应情况，建立统一的供应关系；第五，开展全管庄的除四害讲卫生的运动，使管庄的环境面貌为之一新。
    国务院副秘书长、五人工作组组长曾一凡也在会上讲了话。他说，大家对工作组表示热烈欢迎的大字报，是对党和政府高度的信任和拥护的表现。曾一凡说，国务院对于管庄的问题很重视。因为管庄问题不单纯是管庄的问题，它对于全国来说有着相当普遍的意义。国务院决定派了五人工作组，决心解决管庄的问题，从解决管庄的问题中吸取经验教训。
    曾一凡说，我们工作组在国务院和建筑材料工业部的领导下，协助管庄党委，紧紧地依靠党团员积极分子和广大群众，一定要而且一定能够把“自由王国”——管庄的问题彻底解决。
    最后，建筑材料工业部党委副书记徐耀三号召每个党团员带头立刻行动起来，发动广大群众，深入鸣放，勇敢揭发，一定要把管庄整顿好。
