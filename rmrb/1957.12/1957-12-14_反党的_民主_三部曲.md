　　The Anti-Party "Democracy" Trilogy
　　Ding Zi
    Xu Maoyong, using the pen name "Fu Xian," published three consecutive essays on the eighth page of the People's Daily, which were an anti-Party "democracy" trilogy: "Don't Be Afraid of Democracy" on April 20th, "Don't Be Afraid of Undemocratic" on April 27th, and "Experiences of a Third Type of Person" on May 16th. According to Xu Maoyong's "experiences," whether one is afraid of democracy, afraid of undemocratic practices, or "afraid of both" – these are all evidence of "undemocratic" practices in the new society. And this "undemocratic" behavior, it is said, is the root cause of transforming contradictions among the people into antagonistic contradictions. How straightforward!
    In the article "Don't Be Afraid of Democracy," Xu Maoyong used "cunning" tactics against "high-ranking cadres." He said to them: I understand your anxieties about "becoming increasingly afraid of democracy." Your foundations are very weak, "merely a composition of dogmatism, sectarianism, bureaucratism... " and "naturally cannot withstand the impact of democracy." But "the more you fear, the more useless you become," because as things develop, contradictions will turn into antagonistic ones, and then you will be even more afraid. Here there is sarcasm, warning, and intimidation. The conclusion is very clear: "Therefore, whether the contradictions among the people are handled correctly, and whether they will transform into antagonistic contradictions, depends on whether or not there is democracy..." With a few strokes of his pen, Xu Maoyong attributed the emergence of today's antagonistic contradictions to the Communist Party's "lack of democracy," turning anti-Party and anti-socialist elements into "democratic fighters." What a protector of the "democratic fighters"!
    But may I ask Xu Maoyong: Why did the bourgeois right-wingers provoke anti-Party and anti-socialist "antagonistic contradictions"? Is it because the Party wanted everyone to speak out freely and help the Party rectify its style, that it was "afraid of democracy"? You published so many essays in various newspapers and periodicals in a few months, attacking "high-ranking cadres" and slandering the Party's leadership. Is that not also proof that others are "afraid of democracy"? If Xu Maoyongs really "stood on the foundation of democracy," then why would that "foundation" be so weak that it could not withstand the "democratic impact" of the anti-rightist struggle?
    It is not Xu Maoyong, but the facts, that can answer these questions. It is true that contradictions among the people, if not handled correctly, can transform into antagonistic contradictions. But for anti-Party and anti-people elements hidden among the people, even if we handle contradictions among the people perfectly correctly, they may still provoke antagonistic contradictions, and sometimes even use our democracy to provoke antagonistic contradictions; the right-wingers are like this. Therefore, in terms of China's actual situation, whether contradictions among the people will transform into antagonistic contradictions is certainly related to whether the methods of handling contradictions are correct or not, but is it not also related to whether the exploiting classes in the process of transformation can honestly accept socialist transformation? If you insist on "fighting for" the "democracy" of the bourgeoisie, you will inevitably encounter the "democratic impact" of socialism, and you will definitely "not be able to withstand it"! Is that not the fact?
    But Xu Maoyongs never want to learn from the facts. After using "Don't Be Afraid of Democracy" to intimidate "high-ranking cadres," he used "Don't Be Afraid of Undemocratic" to mobilize the masses. In this mobilization order, he first presented Confucius' "benevolence," to prove that even under the system of monarchical autocracy, people had to be given a little "quasi-democracy" and benevolence, otherwise "the people would definitely rise up in rebellion." Then, "in our current society," that is, in a society "where political power already belongs to all the people, and there are no (!) fundamental conflicts of interest between classes," how could "bureaucrats" not give even a little "democracy"? Is it not worth "sacrificing oneself for righteousness" to "rebel"? Listen, "Why be afraid of bureaucratism? People are most afraid of death, but the current bureaucrats do not have so much power that they can cause people to die." This is truly a vehement mobilization order!
    But only anti-Party and anti-socialist right-wingers can be mobilized. Because the people have their own "experiences": "political power" certainly "belongs to all the people," but "there are not necessarily no fundamental conflicts of interest between classes" among the people. Those who are dreaming of "restoration," engaging in anti-Party and anti-socialist activities, and wanting to replace socialist democracy with bourgeois "democracy" are legion. Therefore, it is essential to oppose bureaucratism on the premise of safeguarding and developing socialist democracy, using the fire of criticism to burn away the undemocratic practices of bureaucrats. As for those "cunning" individuals who use bourgeois "democracy" to deceive, they must be subjected to a "democratic impact," and a "democratic impact" has already been carried out. Is that not the fact?
    But Xu Maoyong is, after all, different from the others; he also has "experiences as a third type of person." He uses his identity as a "Communist Party member" to speak from experience, talking about the personal "experiences" of an "eighth-rank official" who "once held power in a small area," saying that like himself, such a "eighth-rank official" who is "afraid of democracy" must also "have suffered from the undemocratic practices of certain people," and is sometimes also afraid of "undemocratic practices." He who is "afraid of democracy" "collapsed," but those "undemocratic" people he was afraid of have not "collapsed"! In Xu Maoyong's view, this situation cannot even compare to bourgeois "democracy," let alone socialist democracy?
    This is Xu Maoyong's "defection" from someone who is "deeply aware of the inside story", which should be able to "defeat the enemy with one blow." But the result has instead "hit" his own weakness. Because "undemocratic practices" toward anti-Party elements is precisely a characteristic of socialist democracy that distinguishes it from bourgeois democracy. Xu Maoyong's "fear of democracy" towards subordinates and his "fear of undemocratic practices" towards superiors is precisely a counter-evidence of the power of socialist democracy under centralized guidance. If those who are "arrogant" like Xu Maoyong had no "fear" towards either subordinates or superiors, would our country still be considered a socialist country?

### 反党的“民主”三部曲

　　反党的“民主”三部曲
　　丁梓
    徐懋庸曾以“弗先”的笔名在人民日报第八版上发表了三篇连续性的杂文，那是反党的“民主”三部曲：4月20日的“不要怕民主”、4月27日的“不要怕不民主”和5月16日的“第三种人的体会”。根据徐懋庸的“体会”，怕民主也好，怕不民主也好，既怕民主又怕不民主的“两头怕”也好，都是新社会“不民主”的证据，而这“不民主”，据说就是使人民内部矛盾转化为对抗性矛盾的根源。多么干脆！
    在“不要怕民主”一文里，徐懋庸对“高级干部”大耍其“巧诈”的手腕。他对他们说：我懂得你们“愈来愈怕民主”的苦衷。你们的基础薄弱得很，“只是教条主义、宗派主义、官僚主义……的构成”，“自然经不起民主的冲击的”。但“愈怕愈不中用”，因为发展下去，矛盾就要变成对抗性的了，那时候你们更要害怕。这里有讥讽，有警告，有恐吓。结论是非常明确的：“所以人民内部的矛盾处理得正确不正确，会不会转化为对抗性的矛盾，是决定于民主不民主……。”徐懋庸轻轻几笔，便把今天对抗性矛盾的产生归因于共产党的“不民主”，使反党反社会主义分子也“转化”为“民主战士”了。好一个“民主战士”们的保镳！
    但得请问徐懋庸：资产阶级右派分子为什么要挑起反党反社会主义的“对抗性矛盾”呢？难道党要大家大放大鸣，帮助党整风，也是“怕民主”吗？你在几个月内，在各种报刊上发表了那么多攻击“大干部”、诬蔑党的领导的杂文，也是别人“怕民主”的反证吗？如果徐懋庸们真的“站到民主的基础上去”了，那么为什么“基础”也会那样薄弱，经不起反右派斗争的“民主的冲击”呢？
    能够回答这些问题的不是徐懋庸，而是事实。不错，人民内部的矛盾，如果处理得不正确，是可能转化为对抗性矛盾的。但是对于隐蔽在人民内部的反党、反人民分子来说，即使我们处理人民内部矛盾的方法完全正确，他们也可能挑起对抗性矛盾，有时甚至会利用我们的民主挑起对抗性矛盾，右派分子就是这样。所以就我国的实际情况说，人民内部的矛盾会不会转化为对抗性矛盾，固然与处理矛盾的方法正确不正确有关，但处在改造过程中的剥削阶级能否老老实实地接受社会主义的改造，难道同这没有关系吗？你硬要“争取”资产阶级的“民主”，就一定要碰到社会主义的“民主的冲击”，而且一定“经不起”！事实不是这样吗？
    可是徐懋庸们从来不想从事实吸取教训。他用“不要怕民主”来恐吓“高级干部”之后，又用“不要怕不民主”来动员群众。在这篇动员令里，他首先端出孔子的“仁学”，以证明在君主专制的制度下，也不能不给人民一点“近乎民主”的仁，否则“人民一定就起来造反”。那末，“在我们现在的社会中”，即“政权既已归于全体人民，阶级之间，既已没有（！）根本利益的冲突”的社会中，“官僚主义者”居然不给一点“民主”，难道还不值得用“杀身成仁”的精神来“造反”吗？你听，“为什么怕官僚主义？人们最怕的是死，但现在的官僚主义者并没有那么大的权力，能致人民于死地。”这真是声色俱厉的动员令！
    可是能够被动员起来的，只有反党反社会主义的右派分子。因为人民有人民自己的“体会”：“政权”固然“归于全体人民”，但人民内部的“阶级之间”不见得“没有根本利益的冲突”，做着“复辟”迷梦的，进行反党反社会主义的活动的，要用资产阶级的“民主”来代替社会主义的民主的，大有人在。所以一定要在保卫和发展社会主义民主的前提下来反对官僚主义，用批评的火来烧掉官僚主义者的不民主，而对于用资产阶级的“民主”来掉包的“巧诈”者，则必须加以“民主的冲击”，而且已经进行了“民主的冲击”了。事实不是这样吗？
    可是徐懋庸毕竟与众不同，他还有“第三种人的体会”哩。他以“共产党员”的身份现身说法，说出了“在小小的范围里当过权”的“八品文官”的切身“体会”，说像他自己这样“怕民主”的“八品文官”，还要“吃过某些人的不民主的苦头”，有时也很怕“不民主”，而“怕民主”的他“垮台”了，可是他所怕的“不民主”者，居然还不“垮台”！在徐懋庸看来，此情此景，连资产阶级的“民主”都远远比不上，还谈得到社会主义民主吗？
    这是“深知底细”的徐懋庸的“反戈一击”，总可以“制敌于死命”了吧，可是结果恰恰“击”中了他自己的要害。因为对反党分子的“不民主”，正是社会主义民主不同于资产阶级民主的一个特色。徐懋庸对下“怕民主”，对上“怕不民主”，正是在集中指导下的社会主义民主的威力的反证。如果像徐懋庸那样的“骄横”者对下对上都没有一点儿“怕”，我们的国家还算社会主义国家吗？
