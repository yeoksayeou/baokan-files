Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech at the Banquet Welcoming Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein

Your Excellency Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein, Ladies and Gentlemen:

First of all, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, and in my own name, I would like to extend a warm welcome to our distinguished guest, His Excellency Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein and his wife, as well as all members of the Burmese Friendly Economic Delegation. It has been exactly one year since Vice Premier He Long and I visited Burma last December and joined the leaders of the Burmese government in attending the joint Chinese-Burmese border people's gathering in Mangshi. It is a great pleasure for me to be able to meet with His Excellency U Kyaw Nyein again in Beijing today.

Your Excellency Deputy Prime Minister, after you come to China, you will surely see for yourself, as you did in Mangshi, how deep the friendship of the Chinese people is for the Burmese people. This friendship has existed between the peoples of China and Burma since ancient times, and in the past eight years, it has undergone significant development on a new foundation. For nearly a hundred years, the Chinese and Burmese people have been comrades in arms, suffering from the same colonial oppression and striving for national independence. Today, in maintaining national independence, opposing wars of aggression, and engaging in peaceful construction, the two countries share common aspirations and determination, and are making unremitting efforts. It is no accident that the two countries have maintained a precious friendship since the establishment of diplomatic relations. We often remember that Burma was one of the first countries to recognize the People's Republic of China and has consistently advocated the restoration of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations. Our two countries have engaged in effective cooperation in maintaining international peace and security and promoting the unity of Asian and African countries. Our two countries and India jointly initiated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. In recent years, our two governments have followed these principles, resolving many issues to the satisfaction of both sides, thus demonstrating the vitality of the Five Principles. We firmly believe that the friendly relations between the two countries, established on the basis of the Five Principles, will be increasingly consolidated and developed.

Your Excellency Deputy Prime Minister, we are very pleased that you have led a friendly economic delegation to our country this time. The Chinese people have always paid attention to and cared about the work of the Burmese people in developing the national economy on the road of independence and self-reliance. One of the important common tasks facing our two countries today is to vigorously develop industrial and agricultural construction and quickly overcome the backward state of the country. In recent years, the people of both countries have been actively working towards achieving this goal. With the progress of construction work and the deepening of friendship between the two countries, economic ties between the two countries have become much closer than before. In terms of trade, the trade volume between our two countries has increased forty-two times in the past three years. Technical cooperation has also begun. Naturally, both countries feel the need to exchange experiences in construction work. We firmly believe that the Burmese Friendly Economic Delegation led by Your Excellency Deputy Prime Minister will greatly help promote mutual understanding and friendship between the two countries, promote economic ties and exchange of experiences between the two countries, which will also be an important contribution to the realization of the Bandung Conference's resolution on developing economic cooperation among Asian and African countries.

The goal of the Chinese people in the next ten to fifteen years is to build China into a socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture on the basis of giving priority to the development of heavy industry and implementing the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture. We have just completed the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy, laying a preliminary foundation for industrialization. However, due to China's large area, large population, and poor foundation, and our lack of experience in construction work, Your Excellency Deputy Prime Minister and other Burmese guests will find that our country is still very backward economically, and in construction work, there are not only successful experiences, but also failed experiences. We are willing to introduce the actual situation to our Burmese friends. We also sincerely hope that Burmese guests will give us valuable advice.

When I visited Burma several times in the past, I was warmly received by the Burmese government and the Burmese people, and I felt like I was at home. I hope that His Excellency Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein and other Burmese guests will feel at home during their stay in our country, whether in Beijing or elsewhere, and enjoy their visits and sightseeing.

In conclusion, I propose a toast:

To the health of His Excellency Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein and his wife,

To the health of His Excellency Prime Minister U Nu,

To the health of His Excellency President U Win Maung,

To the development of friendly relations between China and Burma,

Cheers!

### 在欢迎吴觉迎副总理的宴会上  周恩来总理的讲话

    在欢迎吴觉迎副总理的宴会上
    周恩来总理的讲话吴觉迎副总理阁下：女士们、先生们：
    首先，我代表中国政府和中国人民，并且以我个人的名义，向我们的贵宾吴觉迎副总理阁下和他的夫人以及缅甸友好经济考察团的全体团员们表示热烈的欢迎。自从去年12月我和贺龙副总理访问缅甸并且同缅甸政府的领导人一起参加芒市中缅边民联欢大会以来，已经整整一年了。今天能够在北京同吴觉迎阁下再次会晤，对我来说，是莫大的愉快。
    副总理阁下，你来到中国以后，一定会像在芒市的时候一样，亲自看到中国人民对于缅甸人民怀有多么深厚的友情。这种友情自古以来就存在于中缅两国人民之间，八年来，又在新的基础上有了重大的发展。近百年来，中国人民和缅甸人民是同样遭受殖民主义压迫和同样争取民族独立的患难之交。今天在维护民族独立、反对侵略战争、从事和平建设等方面，两国又具有共同的愿望和决心，并且在进行着不懈的努力。两国自从建交以来，一直保持着珍贵的友谊，这不是偶然的。我们经常记得，缅甸是最早承认中华人民共和国的国家之一，并且一贯主张恢复中国在联合国的合法地位。我们两国在维护国际和平和安全、促进亚非国家团结等方面曾经进行过具有成效的合作。我们两国和印度共同倡导了和平共处五项原则。几年来，我们两国政府遵循着这些原则，使许多问题得到双方满意的解决，从而显示了五项原则的充沛生命力。我们深信，两国在五项原则的基础上建立起来的友好关系必将日益巩固，日益发展。
    副总理阁下，你这次率领一个友好经济考察团前来我国使我们十分高兴。中国人民一向注意和关怀缅甸人民在独立自主的道路上发展国民经济的工作。我们两国今天所面临的共同的重要课题之一，就是大力发展工农业建设，迅速克服国家的落后状态。近年来，两国人民都为实现这一目标而积极努力。随着建设工作的进展和两国友谊的加深，两国之间经济上的联系比以前密切得多了。就贸易而言，最近三年以来，我们两国间的贸易额增加了四十二倍。技术合作也有了开展，很自然地，两国都感到有交流建设工作经验的必要。我们深信，副总理阁下领导的缅甸友好经济考察团来到我国将大大有助于促进两国之间的相互了解和友谊，促进两国之间的经济联系和经验交流，这对于实现万隆会议关于发展亚非国家经济合作的决议，也将是一个重要的贡献。
    中国人民在今后十年到十五年内的目标是在优先发展重工业的基础上，实行工农业同时并举的方针，把中国建成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义国家。我们刚刚完成了发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，奠定了工业化的初步基础。但是由于中国面积大、人口多、底子穷，我们在建设工作方面的经验也还不够，因此副总理阁下和其他缅甸贵宾们在访问各地的时候，将会发现我国在经济上还很落后，在建设工作中不仅有成功的经验，也有失败的经验。我们愿意把实际情况介绍给缅甸朋友们。我们也衷心地盼望缅甸贵宾们向我们提出宝贵的意见。
    我过去几次访问缅甸的时候，都承缅甸政府和缅甸人民给予热情的接待，感到像在自己家里一样。我希望吴觉迎副总理阁下和其他缅甸贵宾们在我国逗留期间，无论在北京或在其他各地，也像在自己家里一样，尽情地参观游览。
    最后，我建议：
    为吴觉迎副总理阁下和他的夫人的健康，
    为吴努总理阁下的健康，
    为吴温貌总统阁下的健康，
    为中缅两国友好关系的发展，
    干杯！
