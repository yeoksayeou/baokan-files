Xinhua News Agency, 15th. The December matches of the second round of the 1957 National Football League, Group A, were held in Shanghai and Nanjing today. In Shanghai, the Beijing team defeated the Shanghai Institute of Physical Education team with a score of 2-1, and the Tianjin team defeated the Red Flag Sports Association team with a score of 1-0. In Nanjing, the "August 1st" team defeated the Wuhan Institute of Physical Education team with a score of 2-0, and the Locomotive Sports Association team defeated the Nanjing Military Region team with a score of 4-0.

　　In the match between the Beijing team and the Shanghai Institute of Physical Education team, both sides were very brave in their offense. In the last two minutes of the first half, the Beijing team's goalkeeper Zhang Junxiu was careless in receiving the ball and failed to catch the light shot in front of the goal by Li Qinliang, the left winger of the Shanghai Institute of Physical Education team, losing a point. In the second half, the Beijing team launched a vigorous counterattack. Within ten minutes, from the twenty-second to the thirty-second minute, center forward Zhang Honggen scored two goals in a row, one with a header and one with a powerful shot, to achieve victory.

　　The Beijing team has already won six and drawn three in the second round, and is the only team that has not been defeated. The eight teams participating in the Shanghai and Nanjing competition zones in the second round have only two games left in this league. The Beijing team will also play against the Nanjing Military Region team and the Wuhan Institute of Physical Education team on the 19th and 22nd respectively. Judging from the current situation, it is basically certain that the Beijing team will win the championship.

　　北京足球队有希望得冠军
    新华社15日讯　1957年全国足球甲级队联赛第二循环12月份的比赛，今天在上海和南京又各举行了两场比赛。在上海，北京队以二比一战胜上海体育学院队，天津队以一比零胜红旗体育协会队。在南京，“八一”队以二比零胜武汉体育学院队，火车头体育协会队以四比零胜南京部队队。
    北京队对上海体育学院队的一场比赛，双方进攻都很勇猛。上半时最后两分钟，北京队守门员张俊秀接球大意，竟没有把上海体育学院队左边锋李勤良在门前轻射的一球接住，丢了一分。下半时，北京队极力反攻，在二十二分钟到三十二分钟的十分钟内，中锋张宏根以一次头顶，一次硬射连续攻入两球，才获得胜利。
    北京队在第二循环比赛中已经六胜三平，是唯一没有败过的队。第二循环参加上海、南京竞赛区比赛的八个队，在这次联赛中还都只剩下两场比赛没有举行。北京队19日和22日还将先后同南京部队队和武汉体育学院队比赛。按目前情势看，北京队获得冠军已经基本上可以肯定了。
