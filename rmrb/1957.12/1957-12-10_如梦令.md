　　Like a Dream
　　Li Zhuozhao
      (Scene at the White House) Wisps of black smoke drift away, the President scratches his cheek and wrings his hands, annoyed as he gazes at the vast sky, the red twin stars remain as before. Backward! Backward! A time of utter hopelessness in the setting sun.

　　如梦令
　　李浊照
      （白宫即景）缕缕黑烟飘走，总统搔腮搓手，恼恨望长空，红色双星依旧。落后！落后！日暮途穷时候。
