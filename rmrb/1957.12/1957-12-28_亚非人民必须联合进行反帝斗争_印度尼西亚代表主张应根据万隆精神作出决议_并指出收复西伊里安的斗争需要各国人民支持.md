Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 26th: At the first plenary session of the Asian-African Solidarity Conference, the head of the Indonesian delegation, Siradjuddin Abbas, said that the Indonesian government recently had to take measures to end the economic rule that the Netherlands was trying to impose on Indonesia. These actions are necessary to safeguard Indonesia's national economy. He also said, "In our struggle to restore sovereignty over West Irian, we need your support."

In his report to the conference on the issue of colonialism, Abbas said that the United Nations had not fully considered Indonesia's demands for a satisfactory solution to the West Irian issue. He went on to say that Indonesia is convinced that more than half of the world's people support its legitimate demands.

Abbas said that although the people of Indonesia had gained independence since 1945, part of its territory was still under the rule of Dutch imperialism. Therefore, in the face of serious danger, the Indonesian government had to declare a state of war at home as a precaution. He expressed his belief that everyone would support these measures. He said that Indonesia pursues a neutral policy and will continue to take a stand against imperialism in accordance with the principles of the Bandung Conference.

Abbas pointed out that some people are attempting to consolidate the position of imperialism, disregarding human rights. However, Indonesia believes that the unity and cooperation between the people of all countries against imperialism is the most effective weapon to fight back against imperialism.

He said that the Indonesian people will never forget the sympathy shown by some countries for their ongoing struggle against imperialist rule. It is for this reason that the Indonesian people have sincere sympathy for the people of all countries who are engaged in liberation struggles.

Finally, the Indonesian representative requested the conference to adopt the following resolutions in accordance with the principles of the Bandung Conference:

One, take joint action to fight against imperialism;

Two, adopt resolutions expressing support for the struggle of the Algerian people, the struggle of the Palestinian people, and the liberation struggles of the people of other Asian and African countries.

    亚非人民必须联合进行反帝斗争
    印度尼西亚代表主张应根据万隆精神作出决议
    并指出收复西伊里安的斗争需要各国人民支持
    新华社开罗26日电　印度尼西亚代表团团长西拉求丁·阿巴斯在亚非团结大会第一次全体会议上说：印度尼西亚政府最近不得不采取措施来结束荷兰力图强加于印度尼西亚的经济统治。这些行动对于保障印度尼西亚的国民经济是必要的。他还说，“在我们恢复对西伊里安的主权的斗争中，我们需要你们的支持”。
    阿巴斯在他向大会作的关于殖民主义问题的报告中说，联合国没有充分考虑印度尼西亚提出的关于圆满解决西伊里安问题的要求。他接着说，印度尼西亚确信，全世界半数以上的人民支持它的正当要求。
    阿巴斯说，尽管印度尼西亚人民从1945年以来就已经获得了独立，但是它的部分领土仍然处于荷兰帝国主义的统治之下，因此在面临严重危险的情况下，印度尼西亚政府不得不宣布在国内处于战争状态，以防万一。他表示相信，大家都将支持这些措施。他说，印度尼西亚奉行中立政策，而且将继续根据万隆会议的原则，采取反对帝国主义的立场。
    阿巴斯指出，有人企图巩固帝国主义的地位，无视人权。但是印度尼西亚相信，反对帝国主义的各国人民之间的团结和合作，是反击帝国主义的最有效的武器。
    他说，印度尼西亚人民永远不会忘记，有些国家对他们正在进行的反对帝国主义统治的斗争所表示的同情。正是由于这个原因，印度尼西亚人民对于正在进行解放斗争的各国人民怀着真挚的同情。
    最后，印度尼西亚代表要求大会根据万隆会议的原则通过下列决议：
    一，采取联合行动同帝国主义进行斗争；
    二，通过决议表示支持阿尔及利亚人民的斗争、巴勒斯坦人民的斗争以及亚非其他国家人民的解放斗争。
