    No Home Leave for Those with Less Than Three Years of Service
    I warmly endorse the State Council's provisional regulations (draft) regarding the vacation and wage benefits for workers and staff returning home to visit relatives. I deeply feel that the Party and the government's concern for employees is meticulous. To make this regulation more complete and more in line with the current and near-future realities of our country, I believe that the following should be added to the regulations: "Generally, workers and staff with less than three years of service should not enjoy the benefits of this regulation."
    I believe that the principle of the state in formulating this regulation is to appropriately meet the needs of employees to visit relatives, while also conforming to the spirit of thrift, benefiting production, and not excessively increasing state expenditures. Therefore, the target of this system should be veteran employees who have worked for more than three years. New employees have not yet made a great contribution to the country and society, and should not enjoy excessive preferential treatment from the state. At the same time, according to general circumstances, these people are young people who have just left school, are not married, and do not have high wage income. Doing so can save the state a large amount of expenditure.

    不满三年工龄不得探亲
    我热烈地拥护国务院关于工人、职员回家探亲的假期和工资待遇的暂行规定（草案）。我深深感到党和政府对职工的关心是无微不至的。为了使这个规定更完善、更符合我国当前和最近将来的实际情况，我认为规定中应加上这一条：“一般工龄不满三年的工人、职员不应享受本规定的待遇。”
    我认为国家制订这个规定的原则，既要适当满足职工探亲的要求，又要符合节约精神，做到有利于生产，又不过多地增加国家开支。因此，这个制度实行的对象应该是参加工作三年以上的老职工。新参加工作的人对国家对社会的贡献还不大，不宜享受国家过多的优厚待遇。同时按照一般情况，这些人都是刚离开学校不久的青年，没有结婚，工资收入也不多。这么作，可以为国家节约很大一笔开支。
