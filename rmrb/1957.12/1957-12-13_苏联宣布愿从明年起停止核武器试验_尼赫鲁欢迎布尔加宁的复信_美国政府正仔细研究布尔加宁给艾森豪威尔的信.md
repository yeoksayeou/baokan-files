Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 12th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru stated today that he welcomes the Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin's reply to him regarding the cessation of nuclear weapons testing and the arms race. He said the reply "certainly deserves the fullest consideration." He stated, "I am grateful that Mr. Bulganin discussed this issue at such length, and that he also suggested that atomic testing should be stopped. This is what we have been saying for a long time."

Prime Minister Nehru made these remarks while speaking in the Council of States during the debate on foreign policy.

All major newspapers in the Indian capital today published the full text of Bulganin's reply to Nehru on the front page under banner headlines.

A "Hindustan Times" reporter wrote, "There is a growing feeling that it is time for the West to change its attitude of picking at every solution."

The reporter also wrote that because the West does not put forward any initiatives, "the West's attitude can be interpreted as merely attempting to prolong international tension."

The "Indian Times," commenting on Bulganin's proposal to stop nuclear weapons testing, said, "The proposal is fair and very pertinent; therefore, Western countries should take it very seriously."

Xinhua News Agency, December 12th: Washington dispatch: A U.S. State Department spokesman said on the 11th that the White House, the State Department, and other government agencies are currently carefully studying the letter from Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin to U.S. President Eisenhower.

According to Reuters reporter Harris, the White House and the State Department are eager to avoid giving the impression that the United States will immediately reject the Soviet proposal. He said the U.S. government may respond only after discussing the letter with the heads of government of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Harris also said that U.S. officials are not currently taking seriously Bulganin's proposal to hold a summit meeting of the heads of government of major Eastern and Western powers to ease international tension. He said the State Department left observers with the impression that it is very sensitive to certain comments in Western Europe that a new attitude toward the Soviet Union might break the current Cold War stalemate. Washington officials frankly admitted that, at a time of increasing emphasis on missiles and bases, the proposal to hold a summit meeting of major Eastern and Western powers to ease international tension has great appeal in the world. The State Department is carefully avoiding immediately rejecting the proposal because one of the United States' "main goals at the Paris conference is to get the allies to agree to the establishment of missile bases or launch pads."

    苏联宣布愿从明年起停止核武器试验
    尼赫鲁欢迎布尔加宁的复信
    美国政府正仔细研究布尔加宁给艾森豪威尔的信
    新华社新德里12日电　印度总理尼赫鲁今天表示欢迎苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁就停止核武器试验和军备竞赛问题给他的复信。他说，这个答复“当然值得给予最充分的考虑”。他说：“我对于布尔加宁用那么长的篇幅讨论这个问题，而且他还建议应该停止原子试验，表示感谢。这也就是我们长期以来一直在说的话”。
    尼赫鲁总理是在联邦院就开始辩论外交政策发言时说这些话的。
    印度首都各报今天都在第一版用通栏大字标题刊载了布尔加宁给尼赫鲁的复信全文。
    “印度斯坦时报”记者写道，“人们愈来愈感到，现在是西方改变它那专门对每个解决办法进行挑剔的态度的时候了。”
    这个记者还写道，由于西方不提出任何倡议，因此“可以把西方的态度理解为仅仅是企图使国际紧张局势长久保持下去。”
    “印度时报”在评论布尔加宁提出的关于停止核武器试验的建议时说：“这个建议是公正的和非常中肯的；因此西方国家应当非常重视它。”
    新华社12日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院发言人11日说，白宫、国务院和其他政府机构目前正在对苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁给美国总统艾森豪威尔的信进行仔细的研究。
    据路透社记者哈里斯报道，白宫和国务院急于避免给人以美国将立即拒绝苏联的建议的印象，他说，美国政府可能要在同北大西洋公约组织各国政府首脑讨论这封信后才作答复。
    哈里斯又说，美国官方目前并没有认真对待布尔加宁提出的关于举行东西方大国政府首脑会议来缓和国际紧张局势的主张。他说，国务院给观察家们留下的印象是，它对西欧认为对苏联采取新态度可能打破目前冷战的僵局的某些言论很敏感，华盛顿人士坦白承认，在日益强调导弹和基地的时候，召开东西方大国会议来缓和国际紧张局势的主张在世界上是有很大的号召力的。国务院小心翼翼地避免立即拒绝这个建议，因为美国“在巴黎会议上的主要目标之一是要各盟国同意建立导弹基地或发射台”。
