A Note

    Scared Themselves
    The "New York Herald Tribune," in a dispatch reporting on the "Gaither Committee" report, said: "The secret materials provided by these reports are simply overwhelming," thus causing two members of the "Gaither Committee" and a member of an outer committee to suffer heart attacks.
    Here, one naturally thinks of the story of former U.S. Secretary of Defense Forrestal, who was so frightened by the war terror he himself created that he jumped to his death. This time, although the members of the "Gaither Committee" did not suffer mental breakdowns, but heart problems, they were similarly frightened by the terror they themselves created.

    吓唬了自己
    “纽约先驱论坛报”在一则报道“盖瑟委员会”报告的电讯中说：“这些报告所提供的秘密材料简直使人吃不消”，因而使“盖瑟委员会”的两个委员和一个外围委员会的委员得了心脏病。
    在这里，人们自然会想起美国前国防部长福莱斯特尔被自己所制造的战争恐怖吓得跳楼自杀的故事。这一次“盖瑟委员会”的委员们虽然不是在神经上出了毛病，而是在心脏上出了毛病，但是他们是被他们自己所制造的恐怖吓坏了却是一样的。
