    Xu Zhou Leeks Shipped North

    "Xu Zhou Leeks" are now on the market and are being shipped to Beijing, Tianjin, and Northeast China.

    "Leeks" are a special winter vegetable product of Xu Zhou, with a yield of nearly one million catties. About 50% are sold to major cities in the north and south, and are popular with consumers.

    According to the person in charge of the Torch Production Cooperative, the largest grower of leeks in the suburbs of Xu Zhou, there has been less rain this autumn, and the leeks are growing well with better quality than in previous years. In order to ensure supply and prevent speculation, the Municipal Vegetable Company has made comprehensive arrangements for the production and sales of leeks this winter, and has reasonably adjusted prices and strengthened market management to ensure reasonable allocation of goods.

    Large Amount of Peat Fertilizer on the South Bank of Taihu Lake

    Farmers building water conservancy projects on the south bank of Taihu Lake have discovered a large amount of high-quality peat fertilizer in areas near the lake. The average thickness of the peat layer is about two feet. It is estimated that this area alone can yield four million dan, which can fertilize 200,000 mu of land. This discovery has greatly encouraged the farmers near the construction site.

    According to preliminary identification, the peat found here belongs to low-lying peat, and the main substances forming the peat are moss and reed plants. It is estimated that there may be large amounts of this peat around Taihu Lake. (Xinhua News Agency)

    Seasonal Aquatic Product "Fresh Ribbonfish"

    Tens of thousands of fishing boats have begun winter ribbonfish operations on the "Shengshan Ocean" sea area in Zhejiang, East China. This year's East China Sea ribbonfish season has started half a month earlier than in previous years, and there have been improvements and increases in fishing gear and vessels. This year's winter ribbonfish season is expected to be another bumper harvest.

    Ribbonfish are called white ribbonfish or foot ribbonfish in some places, and are commonly called ribbonfish because their shape resembles a "ribbon." Ribbonfish groups are found in Shandong Peninsula, Zhejiang coastal area, Fujian, and Guangdong. Its annual output is more than 100,000 tons.

    The peak period of the ribbonfish season is around the "Winter Solstice." As of the 15th of this month, according to incomplete statistics, the East China Sea has produced about 400,000 dan of ribbonfish. Due to the timely purchase, refrigeration, and transportation by aquatic product supply and marketing departments, fresh ribbonfish can now be eaten throughout the country.

    Ribbonfish is an aquatic product with few small bones and tender meat, and it is very nutritious. According to the analysis of the "Food Composition Table" of the former Central Institute of Hygiene, ribbonfish contains 15.9% protein, 3.4% fat, and 2% carbohydrates. There are also many ways to eat ribbonfish, whether it is fried, deep-fried, steamed, or braised. (Zhao Wenhai)

    Glutinous Rice with Three Panicles on One Stem

    Wuxi County, a famous rice-producing area in China, has produced glutinous rice with three panicles growing on one stem.

    This glutinous rice was discovered in the First Agricultural Cooperative of Gedai Township, Wuxi County. In a 4.2 mu glutinous rice paddy, most of the rice stems grew three or two panicles. The panicles had black awns, with a main panicle standing at the end of the stem, and the second and third panicles growing on the second and third sections of the rice stem. According to the cooperative members, the development of these three panicles was not consistent. When the main panicle was already mature, the second and third panicles were still filling. At the autumn harvest, the cooperative members did not notice this phenomenon, so they harvested it at the same time as ordinary rice. At that time, the second and third panicles were not yet mature.

    太湖南岸有大量泥炭肥料
    正在太湖南岸兴修水利工程的农民，在靠近湖滨的地段发现了大量上好的肥料泥炭。泥炭平均厚度约在两尺左右。估计仅这一地段就可挖出四百万担，可以肥田二十万亩。这个发现给工地附近的农民以很大的鼓舞。
    据初步鉴定，这里发现的泥炭属于低位泥炭，形成泥炭的主要物质是苔属、芦苇属植物。估计，这种泥炭可能在太湖四周都有大量存在。　（新华社）
    应季的水产“鲜带鱼”
    在东海浙江“嵊山洋”海面上，上万条渔船开始了带鱼汛冬季作业。今年东海带鱼汛的生产时间比往年提前了半个月，而且网具船只都有改进和增加。今年的带鱼冬汛预计又是一个大丰收。
    带鱼有的地方叫白带鱼、脚带鱼，因形状似“带”普通都叫它带鱼。在我国山东半岛、浙江沿海和福建、广东一带都有带鱼群。它的年产量约在十万吨以上。
    “冬至”前后是带鱼汛的旺盛时期。截至本月15日为止，据不完全的统计，东海带鱼已生产约四十万担。由于水产供销部门及时收购、冷藏和运送，所以现在全国各地都能吃到质量新鲜的带鱼。
    带鱼是一种小刺少、肉细嫩的水产品，营养很丰富。根据前中央卫生研究院“食物成分表”的分析来看，带鱼含有蛋白质15.9％、脂肪3.4％、醣2％。带鱼的吃法也很多，不论煎、炸、清蒸、烧焖都可以。　（赵文海）
    一茎三个穗的糯稻
    我国著名的产稻区无锡县，出现一棵茎上长出三个穗子的糯稻。
    这种糯稻是在无锡县葛埭乡第一农业社发现的，在一块四亩二分的糯稻田里，绝大部分稻茎上都长了三个或两个稻穗。穗上长着黑色的稻芒，一个主穗矗立茎端，在稻茎的第二节和第三节上生出了第二个和第三个穗子。据社员们说，这三个穗子的发育不够一致，当主穗已经成熟的时候，第二穗和第三穗还正在灌浆。秋收时，社员们还没有发现这种现象，以致把它和一般水稻同时收割了，当时第二穗和第三穗都还没有成熟。　（新华社）
