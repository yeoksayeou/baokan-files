    Highest Unit Yield Record for Chinese Fir
    Xihou Village in Nanping County, northern Fujian Province, has created the nation's highest unit yield record for Chinese fir over a large area. According to repeated measurements and verifications by forestry departments and the results of actual felling, the average wood yield per hectare of the village's Chinese fir trees, which are over twenty years old, reaches approximately 600 cubic meters. This is more than double the average yield of 270 cubic meters per hectare for thirty-year-old Chinese fir in Zhengxikou Township, Huitong County, Hunan Province. Among them, one plot of Chinese fir had a wood yield of 1,170 cubic meters per hectare. (Xinhua News Agency)

    Multi-Spike Rice
    The branching, multi-spike rice cultivated this year at the agricultural experimental site of Chongqing Statistical School produced seven rice spikes per stem.
    This type of rice is more robust than other varieties during its growth period, with deep green leaves and tall, strong, and lodging-resistant stems. This type of rice has strong tillering ability, generally with about eight to sixteen tillers per plant, and each tiller has one main spike and two to four branching spikes. The main stem has branches at each node from the second node (from top to bottom) to the sixth node, and the branches grow more branches, with a maximum of eight to nine branches per stem. The main spike of this rice has a total of eleven to thirteen spikelet stalks; each spikelet stalk has three to six small spikelet stalks; each small spikelet stalk has two to seven small spikelets; each spikelet yields 175 to over 290 grains; and the weight of one thousand grains is about 25 grams. The growth period is about 141 days.

    杉木单位产量最高纪录
    福建省北部山区南平县溪后村，创造了全国杉木大面积最高单位产量纪录。根据林业部门多次测量核定和实际砍伐的结果证明，这个村二十多年生的杉木，每公顷木材平均产量达六百立方公尺左右，比湖南省会同县政溪口乡三十年生的杉木，每公顷平均产量二百七十立方公尺多一倍以上。其中有一片杉木每公顷木材产量达一千一百七十立方公尺。　　　（新华社）
    多穗稻
    重庆统计学校农业试验地今年培育的分枝多穗水稻，一茎长出七个稻穗。
    这种水稻，生长期中较其它品种健旺，叶色浓绿，茎秆高大，坚硬抗倒。这种水稻分蘖力强，一般一株约有八至十六个分蘖，每个分蘖又有一个主穗和二至四个分枝穗。主茎从第二节（自上而下）至第六节，每节都有分枝，分枝上又长分枝，最多一茎有八至九个分枝。这种稻的主穗共有十一至十三个支梗；每个支梗上长有三至六个小支梗；每个小支梗有二至七个小穗；每穗结谷一百七十五至二百九十多粒；一千粒谷重约二十五克。生长期为一百四十一日左右。
