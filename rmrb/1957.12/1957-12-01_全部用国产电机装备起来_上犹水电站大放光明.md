Shangyou Hydropower Station Shines Brightly, Equipped Entirely with Domestic Motors

　　Our newspaper, Shangyou, 30th dispatch: China's first in-dam powerhouse hydropower station, the Shangyou Hydropower Station, was completed and officially generated electricity on November 30th.

　　The Shangyou Hydropower Station is built at Tieshanguan in Shangyou County, Jiangxi Province. It is equipped with four 15,000-kilowatt hydraulic turbine generators, with a total generating capacity of 60,000 kilowatts and an annual power generation of 290 million kilowatt-hours. This hydropower station not only provides a large amount of power for the development of various rare metal mineral resources in southern Jiangxi but also guarantees the industrial and lighting electricity consumption in Ganzhou City. In the future, it can also supply some rural and agricultural electricity, which will greatly promote the economic development of Jiangxi Province, especially southern Jiangxi.

　　All the turbines, generators, and giant transformers of this hydropower station are domestically produced. The installation and use of 15,000-kilowatt domestically produced turbines and 12,000-kilowatt transformers in hydropower stations is a pioneering achievement in China's hydropower construction history.

　　This hydropower station officially started construction in July 1955 with the help and guidance of Soviet experts. It began to generate electricity partially in October 1957, taking only two years and eight months. The total cost was only more than 57 million yuan. Building a thermal power plant with the same capacity would also take about two years. The cost, calculated at the lowest standard of 1,000 yuan per kilowatt, would also require 60 million yuan, while the cost per kilowatt of the Shangyou Hydropower Station is less than 1,000 yuan. The completion of the Shangyou Hydropower Station breaks the preconceived notion that some hydropower stations take longer to build and require more investment than thermal power plants. It shows that as long as we make good use of our country's water resources, conduct careful exploration and design, and give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of hydropower construction personnel, China's hydropower construction can develop in a faster, better, and more economical way.

　　At 10:00 am on November 30th, the Shangyou Hydropower Station held a grand power generation ceremony. Yang Shangkui, First Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, Bai Dongcai, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, Ouyang Wu, Deputy Governor of Jiangxi Province, and many nearby farmers attended the ceremony.

At present, the civil engineering has been basically completed, and the installation of boiler, turbine, pipeline, and electrical equipment is in full swing.

### 全部用国产电机装备起来　上犹水电站大放光明

    全部用国产电机装备起来
　　上犹水电站大放光明
  　本报上犹30日电　我国第一座坝内厂房水电站上犹水电站于11月30日峻工正式发电。
    上犹水电站建在江西省上犹县境内的铁扇关，共安装一万五千瓩水轮发电机四台，发电量六万瓩，年发电量达二点九亿度，这个水电站不仅为开发赣南各种稀有金属矿产资源提供了大量的动力，并且可保证赣州市工业和照明用电，今后还可以供应一部分农村和农业用电，将大大促进江西省特别是赣南的国民经济的发展。
    这个水电站所有的水轮机、发电机和巨型变压器全部是国产品。一万五千瓩的国产水轮机和一万二千瓩的变压器在水电站安装和使用，在中国水电建设史上还是创举。
    这个水电站在苏联专家的帮助和指导下于1955年7月正式开工兴建，至1957年10月部分开始发电，先后仅费时二年零八个月。全部造价只五千七百多万元。建设同样容电量的火电厂也需要二年左右的时间，造价按最低标准每瓩一千元计算也需要六万元，而上犹水电站每瓩造价还不到一千元。上犹水电站的建成打破某些水电站比火电厂建设慢，投资大的成见看法，说明只要很好地利用我国水利资源，精心地勘查设计，发挥水电建设人员的积极性和创造性，我国的水电建设就可以又多又快又好又省地发展。
    11月30日十时，上犹水电站举行隆重的发电典礼，中共江西省委第一书记杨尚奎、省委书记白栋材、江西省副省长欧阳武和附近许多农民都参加了典礼。（附图片）
