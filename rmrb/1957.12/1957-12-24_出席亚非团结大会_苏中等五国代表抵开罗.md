Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 23rd: The Chinese delegation, headed by Guo Moruo, arrived in Cairo on the afternoon of December 22nd via a Tu-104 special plane from Moscow to attend the Asian-African Solidarity Conference.

The Soviet delegation, headed by Sharof Rashidov, Vice-Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, as well as delegations from Mongolia, North Korea, and Vietnam, arrived on the same plane.

Cairo International Airport presented a scene of jubilation that day. When the giant Tu-104 jet landed at the airport at 4:20 PM Cairo time, carrying the first group of attendees for the conference, hundreds of Egyptian students, workers, and representatives of people's organizations waved flags and shouted slogans such as "Welcome peace fighters," "Asian-African solidarity and friendship," and "Down with imperialism."

The delegations from the Soviet Union, China, and three other countries were welcomed by members of the Egyptian reception committee, headed by Khaled Mohieddin. These committee members included many Egyptian parliamentarians, writers, and prominent artists.

As the heads of the various delegations stepped out of the aircraft to the sound of music from the band, they were immediately surrounded by the crowd. Female students in uniform presented flowers to the guests, and then the welcoming crowd escorted the guests to the airport lounge. There, Mohieddin delivered a short speech, welcoming the delegations of the five countries to Cairo on behalf of the Egyptian people and the reception committee. Mohieddin said, "The unity of the people of all countries is a barrier to protect us from imperialist aggression, and it is an effective force for defending peace." He also said that the upcoming conference will consolidate the friendship between the people of all countries and will inevitably have an impact on peace-loving people.

    出席亚非团结大会
    苏中等五国代表抵开罗
    据新华社开罗23日电　出席亚非团结大会的中国代表团在郭沫若率领下，从莫斯科乘图—104专机在22日下午到达开罗。
    乘同一架飞机到达的有：以苏联最高苏维埃主席团副主席夏·拉希多夫为首的苏联代表团，以及蒙古、朝鲜和越南代表团。
    开罗国际机场这天呈现一片欢腾景象。当巨型的图—104喷气式客机在开罗时间四点二十分载着来出席大会的第一批人员在机场着陆时，数百名挥舞旗帜的埃及学生、工人和人民团体的代表高呼“欢迎和平战士”、“亚非团结和友好”和“打倒帝国主义”等口号。
    苏、中等五国代表团受到以哈立德·毛希丁为首的埃及接待委员会委员们的欢迎。这些委员中包括许多埃及议员、作家和著名艺术家。
    各国代表团团长在乐队的音乐声中步出机舱后，立即被群众包围起来。穿着制服的女学生向客人们献了花，随后欢迎的群众把客人们拥到了机场上的客厅里。在这里，毛希丁发表了简短的演说，他代表埃及人民和接待委员会欢迎五国代表团来到开罗。毛希丁说：“各国人民之间的团结是保护我们免受帝国主义侵略的屏障，它是保卫和平的有效力量。”他还说，即将举行的大会将巩固各国人民之间的友谊，并且必然会对爱好和平的人民发生影响。
