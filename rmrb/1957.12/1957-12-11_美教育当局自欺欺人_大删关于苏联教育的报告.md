Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch from New York: The "New York Post" recently published an editorial exposing the US education authorities' shameful deletion of the original manuscript when recently publishing a report on the state of Soviet education.

The editorial said that the original report was written by Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt. The published report admitted that Soviet science education was superior to that of the United States. However, in order to "reduce the impact of the report to a safe limit," the US government did not hesitate to drastically delete and distort Mrs. Roosevelt's original manuscript, and even intentionally understated the number of Soviet university students by one million.

    美教育当局自欺欺人
    大删关于苏联教育的报告
    据新华社10日讯　纽约消息：“纽约邮报”最近发表一篇社论，揭露美国教育当局在最近发表一个谈到苏联教育情况的报告时曾经对原稿进行了可耻的删改。
    社论说，原报告是由伊丽诺·罗曼夫人编写的。公布了的报告承认苏联的科学教育优于美国。但是美国政府为了把报告的影响“缩小到安全限度”，竟不惜对罗曼夫人的原稿大肆删改并且加以歪曲，甚至有意把苏联大学生人数少说了一百万人。
