The Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the Central Committee of the CPSU Publishes Unpublished Manuscripts of Marx

The Soviet journal "Modern and Contemporary History" in its third issue published fragments of Karl Marx's unpublished manuscript of a set of essays on "Revolutionary Spain" from November 1854.

In the summer of 1854, with the counter-revolutionary forces in Europe rampant, revolutionary events broke out in Madrid. Marx and Engels warmly congratulated the Spanish people on their struggle against autocracy. They wrote in the "New York Tribune": "We have again seen the invincible and inviolable barricades. Evil forces have disappeared. A new revolutionary era has become possible."

In order to better explore the nature and causes of the 1854 events, Marx began to study the history of Spain, especially the Spanish revolution in the first half of the nineteenth century. Marx's series of essays "Revolutionary Spain," serialized in the "New York Tribune" from September to December 1854, was a summary of these topics. A total of eight essays on the history of the Spanish revolution were published: from the War of Liberation against Napoleon I to the January 1, 1820 uprising led by Riego. However, according to Marx's notebooks, in addition to these eight essays, he also sent three essays on revolutionary Spain to the editorial department of the "Tribune." None of these three essays were published, and the manuscripts have not been found to this day. However, among the large number of manuscripts written by Marx related to his research on Spain, there is still a manuscript written in English, which appears to be part of the essay sent to the "Tribune" editorial department on November 21.

The manuscript elaborates on the final stage of the Spanish Parliament's struggle against the intervention of 1822-1823, the restoration of Ferdinand VII, and the victory of the counter-revolutionary forces. The manuscript is missing the first page, and the second page begins with only half a sentence. The middle part of the manuscript analyzes the nature and dynamics of the Spanish revolution of 1820-1823, including some important theoretical conclusions that are of great relevance to understanding the entire history of Spain in the nineteenth century. In it, Marx seems to summarize the series of essays "Revolutionary Spain," which is of great help to readers in understanding the complex events that occurred in Spain. Marx believed that the reason for the failure of the 1820-1823 revolution (which was bourgeois in nature) was that the revolutionary residents of the cities failed to gain the support of the peasants. While pointing out many special opportunities in the development of this revolution, Marx emphasized that in addition to the general laws of social development, the national characteristics and ancient traditions of various nations also had a great impact on the course of history.

The Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the Central Committee of the CPSU is preparing to include this part of the manuscript in the tenth volume of the second edition of the Collected Works of Marx and Engels.

　　苏共中央马克思列宁主义研究院公布未发表的马克思的手稿
    苏联“近代史和现代史”杂志第三期刊载了从未发表过的卡尔·马克思关于1854年11月“革命的西班牙”的一组论文的手稿片断。
    1854年夏，在欧洲反革命势力嚣张的情况下，马德里爆发了革命事件。马克思和恩格斯热烈地祝贺西班牙人民反对专制制度的斗争。他们在“纽约论坛报”上写道：“我们又看到了所向无敌的、不可侵犯的街垒。邪力消逝了。新的革命纪元成为可能。”
    为了更好地探讨1854年事件的性质和原因，马克思着手研究西班牙的历史，特别是十九世纪上半期西班牙的革命。马克思在1854年9至12月在“纽约论坛报”上连载的一组论文“革命的西班牙”，就是这些课题的总结。共计刊载了八篇关于西班牙革命史的论文：从反对拿破仑第一的解放战争开始到吕埃果所领导的1820年1月1日的起义为止。但是，从马克思的笔记本上看来，除了这八篇论文以外，他寄给“论坛报”编辑部的还有三篇关于革命的西班牙的论文。这三篇论文一篇也没有发表，而这些手稿至今也未找到。但是，马克思所写的与研究关于西班牙的丰富著作有关的大量的手稿中间还保存有一篇用英文写的手稿，看来，它乃是11月21日寄往“论坛报”编辑部的论文的一部分。
    手稿阐述了西班牙国会反对1822—1823年干涉的斗争的最后阶段，阐述了裴迪南第七的复位以及反革命势力的胜利。手稿缺第一页，第二页开头只有半句话。手稿中间部分分析了1820—1823年西班牙革命的性质和动力，包括一些对了解整个十九世纪西班牙历史有很大关系的重要的理论性的结论。马克思在其中仿佛给“革命的西班牙”一组论文作了总结，这对读者了解西班牙所发生的复杂的事件大有帮助。1820—1823年革命（按其性质是资产阶级革命）失败的原因，马克思认为在于城市革命的居民没有能够得到农民的支持。马克思在指出这次革命发展中的许多特殊的机遇时强调说，除了社会发展的一般规律外，各个民族的民族特点和古老的传统，也对历史的进程发生了巨大的影响。
    苏共中央马克思列宁主义研究院准备把这一部分手稿载入第二版马恩全集的第十卷。
