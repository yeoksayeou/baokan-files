Talking to Young People About the Issue of "Politics and Expertise"
Liu Xianzhou, Vice President of Tsinghua University

Currently, our country is advancing on the road of socialism, and socialist transformation is developing in depth. In the process of transformation, there will be a struggle between the two lines of capitalism and socialism in all aspects; that is to say, there will be a struggle between bourgeois ideology and working-class ideology. Correctly resolving this issue means "passing the test of the socialist revolution." Only when all aspects of the country have passed the test of the socialist revolution can the country's socialism be consolidated. At present, our Party is vigorously calling for nationwide socialist education, which is a concrete measure aimed at this issue.

The cause of higher education is an aspect of the cause of socialist construction. It also has the same nature in the transition period and must be transformed from capitalist education to socialist education. In this process of transformation, the struggle between the two lines of capitalism and socialism naturally exists. Therefore, the struggle between bourgeois ideology and working-class ideology will naturally occur. Moreover, since most people who are most closely related to the cause of higher education, such as teachers and students, come from bourgeois and petty-bourgeois families, they are more likely to have old bourgeois ideas. During the anti-rightist struggle, the debates on teaching and scientific research work in schools fully demonstrated the existence of this two-line struggle. Undeniably, the issue of the relationship between "politics and expertise" or "redness and expertise" that has occurred among many young people in schools in recent years is a concrete reflection of the struggle between bourgeois and working-class ideologies in some young people.

Some people may not be convinced by this view, thinking that "expertise first, politics later" or "expertise first, redness later" is acceptable. They believe that if expertise is learned well, can't it also serve the people? Why is it said to have bourgeois ideas? Then, it is best to ask yourself: Does this idea mean that emphasizing political study at the same time will delay some time for learning expertise and be detrimental to personal prospects? Focusing only on personal interests is the essence of bourgeois ideology; and based on the experience of the past few years, it is difficult to expect someone with this kind of thinking to wholeheartedly serve the people, even if they have learned their expertise well. Because at that time, they will have more "capital" and will be even more concerned about their personal interests.

Currently, many young people have various surface reasons for raising this issue. In general, the most important seems to be the "division of labor theory." They believe that "politics" and "expertise" can be separated and opposed to each other.

First, it is division of labor by person. They believe that: "Politics and expertise are different in nature; study time interferes with each other, and it is difficult for one person to take care of both. It is unrealistic to strive to be both a scientist and a revolutionary." Some even use the following facts as a basis: Currently, there are many scientists in our country who are not Party members, and there are even more Party members who are not scientists, but both are useful to the country. They do not know that this phenomenon has its certain historical roots. Because during the period of reactionary rule, most of the scientists in the country came from the exploiting classes and were educated by the exploiting classes for a long time. It was rarely possible for them to come into contact with revolutionary truth, so very few scientists could become revolutionaries; and the revolutionaries were constantly risking their lives to fight against the enemy, so they had even less time to study science and technology; as a result, the current situation was formed. It is said that the Soviet Union had the same situation after the success of the October Revolution. After liberation, the Party, on the one hand, called on all intellectuals to strengthen political study and conduct ideological transformation through the practice of social reform and their own work. In the past few years, considerable achievements have been made. The political consciousness of most intellectuals has been improved to varying degrees. Some of them have even become working-class intellectuals. On the other hand, in various important work positions in the country, many leading cadres have become excellent experts in the work they are responsible for through practical work and study. Moreover, because they have the cultivation of Marxism-Leninism, their leadership achievements far exceed those of bourgeois experts. At present, both of these aspects are moving towards the common goal of being "both red and expert." This fact can make up for this historical defect. Today's young people, on the one hand, have a good environment for learning expertise, and on the other hand, have a good opportunity for political study. They are unwilling to cultivate themselves into "both red and expert" people based on the results of the dark period in the past. Do they want to cultivate themselves into bourgeois intellectuals first, and then go through a long process of "intellectual ideological transformation"? This is really a pity.

During the period of reactionary rule, especially in the twenty years from 1928 to before liberation, because I hated the political corruption at the time, I also embraced the theory of dividing politics and scholarship. I was determined to specialize in teaching and writing books. I not only did not participate in the government work at the time, but I also did not do the administrative work of the school.

It was not until after liberation that I realized, based on my personal experience, that the political work under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party is essentially different from the political work under the reactionary government in the past. All its plans and measures are truly for the country and the people; that is to say, the current political work is the common cause of all the people under the correct leadership of the Party. Because of this, my view of politics has undergone a fundamental change. Not only have I very happily participated in some political and administrative work, but I also believe that all people with patriotism and a pursuit of truth should participate. We should contribute our share of strength to the great socialist construction cause of the motherland. Some young people still believe that politics and expertise can be separated and that the division of labor can be based on individuals. In their bones, they are thinking about only focusing on their expertise and not asking about politics. This kind of thinking is completely wrong. This is a selfish, individualistic, bourgeois ideology.

Secondly, it is the division of labor by time, by the order of before and after for one person. These people believe that during the study period, because of the lack of time and busy courses, they think of "becoming an expert first, and then studying politics." This is the general idea of "expertise first, redness later." Some people also say: "It is more difficult to delve into expertise, and it is easier to study politics; in the relatively short period of time in school, we should seize the time to learn expertise well, and it will not be too late to study politics after leaving school." There is also a completely exposed bourgeois statement: believing that "having expertise means having everything; expertise is capital, as long as the expertise is good, reputation and status will be available, and even joining the Party will be easy"! At the same time, they take the fact that a few older scientists, artists, educators, and engineers in the country have been accepted into the Party as an example.

It is true that a few older scientists, artists, educators, and engineers in the country have joined the Party, but the reason why they were accepted into the Party is because they already possessed the qualifications of a Communist Party member, not because they were scientists, artists, educators, or engineers. Everyone thinks, there are still some scientists, artists, educators, and engineers in the country who have not only not been accepted into the Party, but have become famous right-wing elements. This can fully prove that "expertise first" does not necessarily mean that you can be "red later"!

I also made this mistake in the past. After liberation, after the Party's education and several years of political study, I realized that today's so-called politics, in addition to participating in some political activities or administrative work as mentioned above, also has another more important and profound meaning; that is: "It is the guide for our thoughts and actions." I once said to the students in several classes of Tsinghua University: "Because the politics we are studying now is mainly the guide for our thoughts and actions, no one can be separated from it." For example, if I ask a classmate: "Why did you enter a certain major in Tsinghua University?" He may answer: "I am preparing for the needs of the motherland for cadres in this major in industrial construction." But he may also answer (or think in his heart): "I am doing this because this major is very new, there are very few talents in this major, and after graduation, I can get a better position and higher treatment." This is a political issue. Let's ask a graduating student: "Where are you going to work after graduation?" He may answer: "I am willing to go to the place where the motherland needs me most." But he may also answer (or think in his heart): "I want to go to the place that gives me the best position, the easiest work, the best treatment, the most beautiful environment, and is closest to home!" This is also a political issue. Last year, some graduates from a university in Tianjin were assigned to the Northeast, but they refused to go because they thought it was too cold. Some were assigned to Suzhou, went there and ran back to Tianjin because they thought it was too remote. Graduates from a certain college in Shanghai were assigned to Hankou, went there and ran back to Shanghai because they thought watching movies in Hankou was not as convenient as in Shanghai. The aspirations of many graduates from a certain college in Beijing are "three institutes": the Academy of Sciences, the Design Institute, and staying in the college (as an assistant teacher); very few people are willing to go to factories and mines to do practical work. Before the summer vacation this year, Tsinghua University conducted a volunteer survey and statistics on a certain class of graduating students. The results were similar to the "three institutes" thinking. 50% were willing to go to the Academy of Sciences, 20% were willing to go to the Design Institute, and 20% were willing to stay in the school as assistant teachers. Only 10% were willing to go to factories to participate in practical work. In a socialist country, is it possible to train cadres in a planned way for the cause of socialist construction like this? These are all issues of political and ideological consciousness. There are many young people who are even less willing to be red when they become experts.

Anyone's thoughts and actions are influenced by their political cultivation and cannot be separated from it at any time. In fact, the thoughts and actions of me personally, who firmly refused to participate in political work for more than 20 years in the past, although it had a certain degree of passively resisting the spirit of reactionary and corrupt politics, still could not escape the politics of the time. If we go further and look at the problem from the standpoint of the working class, the thought and action of not participating in corrupt politics at that time was not thorough enough. Because in a university controlled by such a government, even if you only serve as a professor, you are still training cadres for it, and you are still decorating its façade. As a result, from the perspective of class stand, you are still serving the enemy! In short, anyone, as long as they have thoughts and actions, cannot be separated from political issues. In recent years, the proposal of "expertise first, redness later" by young people is itself a political issue! How can people leave politics? How can one achieve expertise first and politics later?

Some people think that getting a score of five in political class and often listening to reports means that they have learned politics well. This is wrong, because these are just measures to help study politics, not the study of politics itself. It must be experienced in personal thoughts and actions to be considered a true study of politics. Therefore, it is also incorrect to say that "studying politics is relatively easy." It requires a long period of study and training.

The young people trained in colleges and universities are all cadres who will assume leadership responsibilities in all aspects of the motherland's socialist construction cause in the future. It is also very necessary to participate in some legitimate social activities during their study period to train their work style. If they have a certain amount of training during their study period, it will be easier to succeed in handling affairs when they take on certain work responsibilities after leaving school. Studying science itself also requires the guidance of a materialistic viewpoint in order to avoid mistakes or make fewer mistakes. Therefore, studying politics and engaging in social activities have their important significance.

In short, people with "emphasizing expertise and neglecting politics" or proposing "expertise first, redness later" ideas among some young people are essentially more or less having selfish, individualistic, bourgeois ideas, whether consciously or unconsciously. They are influenced by the old society, the old family, or fathers, brothers, teachers, and friends with old ideas; at the same time, it is also an unavoidable manifestation in the process of socialist ideological revolution in the transition period. I hope that young comrades will overcome it with the greatest determination and the greatest effort. Otherwise, it will be difficult to pass the socialist hurdle. Not only will their own standpoints and viewpoints often conflict with the society they are in in the future, increasing pain; when encountering wrong trends, personal standpoints are more likely to waver. If it is allowed to continue to develop, it may even be possible to degenerate to the road of anti-socialism. The situation of some right-wing elements, both big and small, in the past is a lesson from the past!

People like us who are already in our sixties and seventies have personally experienced a long period of dark and chaotic society. At that time, the country was always in danger of being divided or destroyed. It is very fortunate and happy to be able to meet the motherland starting to move towards prosperity and strength, starting to enter the stage of socialist construction, and seeing the infinite bright future of the motherland in our later years, and we sincerely want to contribute the few remaining years and meager strength to the motherland. Young people are much happier than us to be born in such an era. The socialist construction cause of the motherland and the great contributions of the motherland to the cause of progress of all mankind in the future will be the glorious task of young people. Young people, your vision should be far-reaching, your spirit should be great, and you should try to completely eliminate the bad influence of the old society and the old family on your thinking. During the study period, you must attach equal importance to politics and expertise, and appropriately participate in voluntary labor and physical exercise, so as to cultivate yourselves into all-round developed people and cultivate yourselves into working-class intellectuals.

    同青年们谈谈“政治和业务”的问题
    清华大学副校长　刘仙洲
    目前我们国家正在社会主义的道路上前进，社会主义改造正在深入发展。在进行改造的过程中，各方面都会存在着资本主义和社会主义两条路线的斗争问题；也就是说，都会存在着资产阶级思想和工人阶级思想的斗争问题。正确地解决了这个问题，就是“过了社会主义革命的一关”。全国各方面都过了社会主义革命的一关，国家社会主义才算巩固了。目前，我们党大力号召进行全民性的社会主义教育，就是针对着这一问题的具体措施。
    高等教育事业是社会主义建设事业的一个方面，它在过渡时期也具有同样的性质，也必须由资本主义的教育改造成为社会主义的教育。在这个改造过程中，很自然的也存在着资本主义和社会主义两条路线的斗争问题，因此，也就很自然地要发生资产阶级思想和工人阶级思想的斗争问题。又因为对高等教育事业最有关系的人，如教师和学生，绝大多数是资产阶级和小资产阶级家庭出身的，就更容易具有资产阶级的旧思想。在反右派斗争期间，对学校的教学工作和科学研究工作的争论中，已经充分地表现出这两条路线斗争的存在。无庸讳言，几年以来在学校中不少青年里边所发生的“政治和业务”的关系问题或“红与专”的问题，也正是若干青年里边资产阶级和工人阶级两种思想斗争的具体反映。
    有人对这样的看法也许不大服气，以为“先业务后政治”或“先专后红”都是可以的。他们认为，当业务学好了，不是同样可以为人民服务吗？为什么说是具有资产阶级的思想呢？那么，最好自问一下：这样的想法是不是认为同时重视政治学习就要耽误一部分学习业务的时间，就要对个人的前途不利？凡事只围绕着个人的利益打算盘就是资产阶级思想的本质；而且就过去几年的经验看，凡是具有这种思想的人，即使业务学好了，也很难期望他全心全意的为人民服务。因为那时他更有了一些“资本”，更要围绕着个人的利益打小算盘了。
    目前不少青年对于这一问题提出的表面理由有各种说法。总起来看，最重要的似乎是“分工论”。认为“政治”和“业务”可以分开而对立。
    首先是按人和人来分工。他们认为：“政治和业务性质上是彼此不同的；学习时间上是彼此防碍的，一个人很难兼顾。既要争取做一个科学家，又要做一个革命家是不现实的”。他们有的更拿下面的事实作根据，目前在我国有不少科学家不是党员，也有更多的党员不是科学家，但是两者对国家都是有用的。他们不知道这种现象是有它一定的历史根源的。因为在反动统治时期，国内一些科学家绝大多数出身于剥削阶级，长期地受到剥削阶级的教育，很少可能接触革命真理，因此绝少科学家能成为革命家；而革命家们又时时刻刻地冒着生命危险和敌人作斗争，更很少有时间进行科学技术的学习；结果就形成目前这种情况。苏联在十月革命成功以后，据说也有同样的情况。解放以后，党一方面号召所有知识分子加强政治学习，并通过社会改革的实践和本身业务来进行思想改造，几年以来，已收到相当的成绩。多数知识分子在政治觉悟上都有了不同程度的提高。其中一部分并已成为工人阶级的知识分子。另一方面，在国家各项重要工作岗位上，有不少领导干部经过实际工作的锻炼和学习，他们对于负责领导的业务，已成为优秀的专家。更因为他们具有马列主义的修养，领导的成绩，多远远超过资产阶级专家以上。目前，这两方面，都正在向着“又红又专”的共同目标前进。这种事实，正可以补足这一历史缺陷。现在的青年们，一面有很好的业务学习环境，一面又有很好的政治学习机会，竟以过去黑暗时期产生的结果为标准，不愿把自己培养成为“又红又专”的人，难道说愿意先把自己培养成资产阶级知识分子，再经过一段长期的“知识分子思想改造”过程吗？这真是太可惜了。
    我在反动统治时期，特别自1928年到解放前的二十年里边，因为痛恨当时的政治腐败情况，也曾经抱着搞政治和搞学问的分工论。立志专门教书写书，不但不参加当时的政府工作，连学校的行政工作都不干。
    我这种思想直到解放以后，根据亲身的体验，认识到：在中国共产党领导下的政治工作和过去反动政府时的政治工作有着本质上的不同，它的一切计划和措施真正是为国为民的；也就是说：现在的政治工作是在党的正确领导下，全体人民的共同事业。因为这样我对政治的看法才有了根本的改变，不但自己很愉快地参加了一些政治工作和行政工作，并且认为所有具有爱国心和追求真理的人们都应当参加。尽我们应尽的一份力量，贡献给祖国伟大的社会主义建设事业。有些青年们现在还认为政治和业务可以分开，可以按人和人来分工，骨子里就是想着自己专搞业务不问政治。这种思想是完全错误的。这是一种自私自利的个人主义的资产阶级思想。
    其次是，一个人按时间的前后分工。这些人认为在学习期间，因为时间少、课程忙，想着“先成一个专家，然后再学习政治”。也就是一般所说的“先专后红”的主张。也有人说：“钻研业务比较难，学习政治比较容易；在学校比较短的一段时间内，应该抓紧时间先学好业务，出校以后再学习政治也不晚”。更有一种完全暴露出资产阶级思想的说法：认为“有了业务就有了一切；业务是资本，只要业务好，名誉地位就都有了，甚至入党也容易了”！同时更拿国内已有少数年长的科学家、文艺家、教育家和工程师们被接收入党作例证。
    国内已有少数年长的科学家、文艺家、教育家和工程师入了党确是事实，但是他们所以被接收入党，是因为他们已经具备了共产党员的条件，并不是因为他们是科学家、文艺家、教育家或工程师而入党的。大家想想，国内还有一些科学家、文艺家、教育家和工程师，不但没有被接收入党，反而成了著名的右派分子，这可以充分证明“先专”不见得就能“后红”吧！
    这种错误想法，我从前也是犯过的。到解放以后，经过党的教育和几年的政治学习，才明确了今天的所谓政治，除前边所说的参加一部分政治活动或行政工作以外，还有它另一种更重要更深刻的意义；就是：“它是我们思想和行动的指南”。我曾对清华大学几个班的同学们说过：“因为我们现在学习的政治，主要是我们思想和行动的指南，所以任何人也不可能脱离它。”例如，我若问一位同学：“你为什么考入清华大学的某一专业？”他可能答：“我为的是准备祖国在工业建设中对这一专业干部的需要。”但是，他也可能答（或者是心里想）：“我为的是这一专业很新，这一专业的人才特少，毕业以后，可以得到较好的地位，较高的待遇。”这是政治问题。我们再问一位毕业同学说：“你毕业以后到哪里去工作？”他可能答：“我愿到祖国最需要的地方去。”但是他也可能答（或者是心里想）：“我要到给我的地位最好，工作最轻，待遇最优，环境最美，离家最近的地方去！”这也是政治问题。去年天津某大学的毕业生有分配到东北的，不肯去，嫌太冷。有分配到苏州去的，去了又跑回天津，嫌太偏僻。上海某学院的毕业生分配到汉口，去了又跑回上海，嫌汉口看电影不如上海方便。北京某学院许多毕业生的志愿是“三院”：科学院、设计院和留在本院（任助教）；愿到厂矿去作实际工作的人很少。今年暑假前，清华大学曾对某班将毕业的学生作过一次志愿调查和统计，结果也和“三院”思想差不多。有50％愿到科学院，有20％愿到设计院，有20％愿留校任助教。只有10％愿去工厂参加实际工作。在社会主义国家为社会主义建设事业有计划的培养干部，像这样能行么？这都是政治思想觉悟问题。有不少的青年，等到专了就更不愿红了。
    任何人的思想行动，都是受着他的政治修养的影响的，是时时刻刻无法脱离的。实在说起来，过去我个人那二十多年坚决不参加政治工作的思想和行动，它固然有某种程度的消极的抗拒反动腐败政治的精神，但终不能脱出当时的政治之外。若更进一步，就工人阶级的立场来看问题，当时那种不参加腐败政治的思想和行动，并不够彻底。因为在那样政府控制下的大学里，即使只担任教授，仍旧是为它培养了干部，仍旧是为它装饰了门面。结果，在阶级立场上看同样是为敌人服务！总之，任何人，只要有思想，有行动，都是无法脱离政治问题的。近年来青年们提出“先专后红”的主张，它本身也是一个政治问题！人又那能离开政治呢？那能做到先业务后政治呢？
    有些人认为：政治课能得五分，经常听报告，就算学好了政治。这是错误的，因为这些都只是帮助学习政治的措施而不是学习政治的本身，必须是体验到个人的思想和行动上来，才算是真正学习了政治。所以说“学习政治比较容易”也是不正确的。它需要长时期学习和锻炼。
    在高等学校培养的青年都是将来在祖国社会主义建设事业各方面担负领导责任的干部。在求学时代参加一些正当的社会活动以训练自己的工作作风也是很必要的。若在学习期间就有一定的训练，离校以后担负一定工作责任时，处理事务就比较容易成功。学习科学本身也需要有唯物观点的指导才能不犯错误或少犯错误。所以学习政治和从事社会活动是有它的重要意义的。
    总之，目前在一部分青年里边具有“重业务轻政治”或提出“先专后红”想法的人，无论是自觉的或是不自觉的，他们本质上都是或多或少的具有自私自利的个人主义的资产阶级思想；是受到旧社会、旧家庭、或抱有旧思想的父兄师友们的影响的；同时它也是在过渡时期社会主义思想革命过程中不易避免的一种表现。希望青年同志们要用最大的决心最大的努力来克服它。不然的话，就很难通过社会主义的一关。不但自己的立场观点会常常和今后所处的社会发生矛盾，增加痛苦；一遇歪风，个人的立场更容易发生动摇。若任它继续发展下去，甚至有可能堕落到反社会主义的道路上去。过去一些大大小小的右派分子的情况就是前车之鉴！
    像我们这样年龄已到六七十岁的人，亲身经历过一大段黑暗混乱的社会，那时国家时时有被人瓜分或灭亡的危险。到晚年能遇到祖国开始走向繁荣富强，开始进入社会主义建设的阶段，已经看到祖国前途的无限光明，感到非常幸运和愉快，并且衷心的愿意把余下的不多的年月、微薄的力量贡献给祖国。青年们生在这样的时代是比我们幸福的多。祖国社会主义建设事业和祖国今后对于全人类进步事业的伟大贡献，将是青年们的光荣任务。青年们，你们眼光应该放远，气魄要大，要尽量把旧社会旧家庭给你们思想上的坏影响完全去掉。在学习期间，一定要对政治和业务并重，并适当地参加义务劳动和体育锻炼，把自己培养成为全面发展的人，培养成为工人阶级的知识分子。
