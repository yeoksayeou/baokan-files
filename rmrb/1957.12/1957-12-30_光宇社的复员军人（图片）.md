    Demobilized Soldiers of Guangyu Cooperative
    In Guangyu Agricultural Cooperative, Jianping County, Hebei Province, where "Mother of Soldiers" Rong Guanxiu is located, there are several demobilized soldiers who are deeply loved by the masses because they actively take the lead in production and maintain close ties with the masses. Demobilized soldier Song Fuxi was elected as the secretary of the CCP party branch this year, and Han Chongyue was elected as the village director.

    In the manure accumulation campaign, the demobilized soldiers played a leading role. They got up early and collected more. Up to now, the village has accumulated more than 700,000 jin of fertilizer, laying a good foundation for increased production in the coming year.
    This is the flock of sheep of Guangyu Cooperative.
    Rong Guanxiu and Song Fuxi are happy for the beautiful vision of the future. They said, "In the future, let our 'trees cover the sky and sheep fill the mountains.'"
    Demobilized soldiers are working hard to learn agricultural techniques. Han Chongyue is consulting with cadres sent down from the Academy of Sciences about the method of "artificial pollination of corn."
    To welcome the great harvest in the coming year, Guangyu Cooperative is building a reservoir.
    "Mother of Soldiers" Rong Guanxiu is very concerned about the demobilized soldiers and often learns about their life and production. This is her visiting at the home of a demobilized soldier.

    光宇社的复员军人
    在“子弟兵母亲”戎冠秀所在的农业社——河北省建屏县光宇农业社，有几位复员军人，由于他们在生产中积极带头，密切联系群众，深受群众爱戴。复员军人宋富喜今年被选为中共党支部书记，韩崇月被选为村主任。

    在积肥运动中，复员军人起了带头作用，他们起的早拾的多。到目前止，全村已积肥七十余万斤，给来年增产打下了良好基础。
    这是光宇社的羊群。
    戎冠秀和宋富喜，为未来的美好远景而高兴。他们说，将来让咱们的“树遮天，羊满山”。
    复员军人对农业技术都很努力学习。韩崇月正向科学院下放干部请教关于“苞米人工辅助授粉”的方法。
    为迎接来年大丰收，光宇社正在兴修水库。
    “子弟兵母亲”戎冠秀非常关怀复员军人，经常了解他们的生活、生产情况。这是她在复员军人家里探望。
