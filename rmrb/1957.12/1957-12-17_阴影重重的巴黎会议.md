　　The Paris Conference Shrouded in Shadows
　　By Pan Fei, our correspondent
    London, December 16th – The highest-level meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, attended by sixty delegates from fifteen countries—including prime ministers, foreign ministers, and defense ministers—opened in Paris today.

    The holding of such a conference was determined as early as the meeting between Eisenhower and Macmillan. For two months, the United States and Britain have been engaged in a series of activities—from mobilizing public opinion to impatiently launching non-flying artificial satellites—to prepare for this conference. There is no doubt about their emphasis on this conference.

    The Paris Conference has been given this mission: it must inject "new life" into the North Atlantic Group, giving it a new "direction" and "confidence."

    Eisenhower and Macmillan are determined to perform a "resurrection" operation for this dying military bloc. They also demanded that the Paris Conference specifically implement the principle of "mutual dependence," in other words, how to more effectively salvage the already defeated "deterrence policy," how to further expand the nuclear arms race, and how to continue to intensify the "Cold War."

    It seems that both Eisenhower and Macmillan have spared no effort to place a large political bet on the Paris Conference. Unfortunately, the current situation is very different from when this military bloc was established more than eight years ago. The Paris Conference is being held under circumstances where the balance of power between the two camps has undergone fundamental changes, and the contradictions between capitalist countries have become even more acute.

    It is conceivable that Eisenhower will call for "strengthening unity" at the Paris Conference, and Macmillan will advocate "mutual dependence," and so on. However, even judging from the pre-conference preparations, the conflicting interests of the member states of the North Atlantic Group are difficult to reconcile.

    The United States clearly emphasizes the military nature of this conference. Eisenhower's mission to Paris is to send the disaster of nuclear war to the people of Western European countries as a Christmas gift. The U.S. government does not deny that the U.S. is interested in finding missile launch sites in Western Europe. They not only want to establish missile bases in countries such as Britain, France, and Italy... but also want to push these bases to countries bordering the Soviet Union, such as West Germany, Denmark, and Norway. As everyone knows, the United States does not yet have intercontinental missiles, and the medium-range missiles under development have a range of only 1,500 miles. The United States hopes to set up missile bases in the heartland of Northern and Central Europe, as well as in Near Eastern countries like Turkey, placing the Soviet Union's industrial centers within the range of U.S. medium-range missiles, thereby rebuilding the U.S.'s "deterrent power."

    Reports indicate that the United States will propose nine suggestions to the "North Atlantic Treaty Organization," including storing strategic nuclear weapons in Western Europe, the United States supplying medium-range missiles to Western Europe, and strengthening "scientific cooperation" between the United States and Western Europe. However, all Western European countries, including Britain, emphasize the need to strengthen "political consultation" to varying degrees. Regarding the establishment of missile launch sites, not only have Norway and Denmark expressed clear refusal, but even Adenauer of West Germany has adopted a cautious attitude. This is precisely what Dulles is worried about, that the Paris Conference may only make vague principled decisions on this issue; while the United States hopes to reach specific agreements.

    Britain will play a special role at the Paris Conference. To Western Europe, it appears as Washington's agent; to the United States, it claims to be Western Europe's "representative." Since the Washington talks, a clear tendency in British foreign policy has been to strengthen "cooperation" with the United States, further rely on the United States, and use a set of traditional methods in this process to elevate itself and suppress the United States. It is under this guiding thought that Britain generously opened its territory to allow the United States to establish missile bases. The British government comfortably allows American planes carrying nuclear weapons to "patrol" the skies. Britain has also played the role of the U.S.'s "think tank," and many schemes have been provided to Washington by Downing Street, such as suggesting the merger of Western European countries' armies. But at the same time, Britain also requires that the U.S.-British relationship should be an "equal alliance," with "full cooperation" rather than a "small partner relationship."

    France is participating in the Paris Conference with dissatisfaction and skepticism. It strongly opposes the attempt by the United States and Britain to monopolize nuclear weapons production under the slogan of "mutual dependence." It is unwilling to recognize the special status of the United States and Britain in the "North Atlantic Treaty Organization." French government officials are uneasy about Dulles' statement that the Paris Conference will help resolve the Algerian issue. They stated that if they were asked to choose between the North Atlantic Group and Algeria, they would rather have Algeria than the North Atlantic Group.

    France's position on many issues is supported by West Germany. This makes the differences between Western European countries and the United States, as well as between Western European countries and the United States and Britain, even more prominent.

    A series of "troublesome" specific issues are also facing the Paris Conference. For example, if the North Atlantic Group is armed with missiles, who will control these weapons? There is currently a so-called "double-key trigger" theory circulating, that is, Western European countries "control" the missiles, and the United States controls the nuclear warheads. But simple common sense tells people that war command, which requires a high degree of centralization, cannot achieve this kind of "dual" leadership. Another example: how will the production of weapons be divided? Every huge monopoly group hopes that the Paris Conference will make decisions that are most beneficial to itself. The British "Manchester Guardian" has expressed concern about this, saying: "British radar may be the best in the world, but there is no reason to believe that the United States will abolish its factories and research institutions in this area and rely on Britain."

    The United States and Britain hope that the Paris Conference can make decisions and take actions on some major issues in order to boost the "North Atlantic Treaty Organization." However, all signs before the conference indicate that the external situation and internal disputes have placed this military bloc in a state of disintegration. All efforts to change this situation will be futile.

### 阴影重重的巴黎会议

　　阴影重重的巴黎会议
　　本报记者　潘非
    本报伦敦16日电　有十五个国家的六十个代表——包括总理、外交部长、国防部长——参加的北大西洋集团最高级会议，今天在巴黎开幕。
    举行这样一次会议，是早在艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦会谈时确定了的。两个月来，美国和英国进行了一系列的工作——从动员舆论直到迫不及待地放射不能起飞的人造卫星——来准备这次会议。他们对于这次会议的重视是用不着怀疑的。
    巴黎会议被赋与了这样的使命：它必须为北大西洋集团注射“新的生命”重新给它以“方向”和“信心”。
    艾森豪威尔和麦克米伦立志要为这奄奄一息的军事集团施行“起死回生”的手术。他们还要求巴黎会议将具体地贯彻“互相依赖”原则，换句话说，是如何更有效地挽救业已一败涂地的“威慑政策”，如何进一步扩大核军备竞赛与继续加剧“冷战”。
    看来，无论是艾森豪威尔也好，麦克米伦也好，都费尽力气，对巴黎会议下了一注很大的政治赌注。可惜的是，当前局势同八年多前这个军事集团成立的时候大不相同了。巴黎会议是在两个阵营力量对比已起了根本变化，而且资本主义国家间的矛盾也更加尖锐的情况下召开的。
    可以想像，艾森豪威尔将在巴黎会议上呼吁“加强团结”，麦克米伦将会鼓吹“互相依赖”，诸如此类。但是，即使是从会前的准备工作来看，北大西洋集团成员国的利害关系是难以调和的。
    美国明显地强调这次会议的军事性质。艾森豪威尔巴黎之行的任务，是把核战争的灾难当作圣诞节礼物送给西欧国家的人民。美国官方毫不否认，美国感到兴趣的，是能在西欧找到导弹的发射场。它们不仅要在英、法、意……这些国家建立导弹基地，并且要把这种基地推进到西德、丹麦、挪威这些靠近苏联边境的国家。大家知道，美国还没有洲际导弹，正在试制中的中程导弹也只有一千五百英里射程。美国希望把导弹基地设置在北欧、中欧的心腹地带以及像土耳其这样的近东国家，把苏联的工业中心置于美国中程导弹的射程之内，从而重建美国的“威慑力量”。
    有消息说，美国将向“北大西洋公约组织”提出九点建议，包括在西欧储存战略核武器，美国向西欧供应中程导弹，加强美国与西欧的“科学合作”等。但是，所有的西欧国家，包括英国在内都在不同程度上强调必须加强“政治协商”。关于设立导弹发射场，不仅挪威与丹麦已表示了明确拒绝，甚至连西德的阿登纳也采取了谨慎的态度。这正是杜勒斯所担忧的，巴黎会议可能在这一问题上只作出含糊的原则决定；而美国所希望的是达成具体的协议。
    英国将在巴黎会议上扮演一个特殊的角色。对西欧，它以华盛顿的经纪人的面目出现；对美国，它又以西欧的“代表”自居。自从华盛顿会谈以后，英国外交政策中的一个明显倾向是：加强同美国的“合作”，进一步依赖美国，并在这一过程中运用一套传统的手法，来提高自己，压抑美国。正是在这种思想指导下，英国慷慨地开放自己的领土，让美国建立导弹基地。英国政府心安理得地让携带核武器的美国飞机在天空“巡逻”。英国还起了美国“智囊团”的作用，许多计谋都是由唐宁街提供给华盛顿的，例如建议西欧国家军队的合并。但同时，英国又要求美英关系应该是“平等的联盟”，必须“有充分的合作”，而不是“小伙伴的关系”。
    法国是带着不满和怀疑的情绪参加巴黎会议的。它强烈地反对在“互相依赖”口号下由美英垄断核武器生产的企图。它不愿意承认美英在“北大西洋公约组织”的特殊地位。法国政府官员对杜勒斯所说的巴黎会议将有助于解决阿尔及利亚问题的谈话感到不安。他们表示，如果要求在北大西洋集团与阿尔及利亚之间进行选择，那末他们宁愿要阿尔及利亚而不要北大西洋集团。
    法国在许多问题上的立场，得到西德的支持。这就使得西欧国家和美国以及西欧国家和美英之间的分歧更加突出了。
    摆在巴黎会议面前，还有一连串“麻烦的”具体问题。例如，北大西洋集团如果用导弹武装起来，那末这些武器将由谁来控制呢？目前传说着一种所谓“双指拔枪机”的理论，即由西欧国家“控制”导弹，由美国控制核弹头。但简单的常识告诉人们，要求高度集中的战争指挥，是不可能实现这种“双重”领导的。又如：武器的生产将如何分工？各个巨大的垄断集团都希望巴黎会议作出对自己最有利的决定。英国的“曼彻斯特卫报”对此已表示隐忧，它说：“英国的雷达也许是世界上最好的，但也没有理由相信，美国将会撤销它在这一方面的工厂与研究机构，而依赖英国。”
    美国和英国希望巴黎会议能在一些重大问题上作出决定，采取行动，以便为“北大西洋公约组织”打气。但是，会前的一切迹象表明，外部的局势与内部的纠纷，已使这个军事集团处于分崩离析之中。要想改变这种情况的一切努力，都将是徒劳的。
