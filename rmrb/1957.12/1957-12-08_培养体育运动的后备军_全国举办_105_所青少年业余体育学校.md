　　Cultivating a Reserve Force for Sports
　　National Establishment of 105 Youth Amateur Sports Schools

　　This newspaper reports: In order to promote mass sports activities and cultivate outstanding athletes for the future, our country began establishing youth amateur sports schools in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places in 1955. As of June 1957, one hundred and five youth amateur sports schools (twenty-five youth schools and eighty junior schools) have been established in eighty-six cities, currently training ten thousand seven hundred and twenty-three young athletes. The sports programs offered by the youth amateur sports schools include sixteen disciplines such as track and field, gymnastics, swimming, soccer, basketball, volleyball, tennis, badminton, table tennis, skating, skiing, cycling, weightlifting, diving, water polo, and ice hockey, with track and field and gymnastics being the most common.

　　Youth amateur sports schools utilize existing stadiums, gymnasiums, or well-equipped schools and factories to recruit young people who have a certain sports foundation, demonstrate good character at their original units of study or work, and show potential for cultivation. These youths voluntarily attend the schools, spending three to four hours of their spare time each week learning and training according to advanced scientific theories and teaching methods.

　　Among the already established schools, there are two types: one is comprehensive, including more programs, such as the Beijing Youth Amateur Sports School, which has six departments including track and field, gymnastics, swimming, soccer, basketball, and volleyball; the other is single-program, such as the Jilin Skiing Amateur Sports School and the Tianjin Swimming Amateur Sports School. Each school has a part-time or full-time principal or director of education, as well as a certain number of full-time and part-time coaches, thus ensuring regular teaching and training.

　　After more than a year of organized teaching and training, the physique of the young people has generally been enhanced. For example, students in the track and field class of the Shanghai No. 1 Junior Amateur Sports School, upon enrollment, had an average height of 160 cm, weight of 108 *shi jin* (54 kg), vital capacity of 3200 ml, blood pressure of 118/66 mmHg, and grip strength of 68 *shi jin* (34 kg) (combined for both hands). After one year, their height increased to 165 cm, weight to 115 *shi jin* (57.5 kg), vital capacity to 4300 ml, blood pressure to 110/64 mmHg, and grip strength to 117 *shi jin* (58.5 kg). The reason their physical functions have developed so rapidly is inseparable from systematic physical education and training. In addition, the sports technical level of the young people has also been significantly improved, and many have reached the standards of graded athletes. For example, among the 690 students enrolled in Tianjin in the first year, 511 reached the graded athlete standard after one year of teaching and training, accounting for 76% of the total number of students. The third-grade students in the junior swimming department of the Beijing Youth Amateur Sports School totaled eleven. In the 1956 test, only one person reached the level of a second-grade athlete, but after a period of training, all of them have now reached the standard of second-grade athletes.

　　Through learning, some young people have not only significantly improved their sports performance and generally enhanced their physique, but also improved their academic performance, and have therefore been rated as outstanding students in their original schools. Many young people have also become the mainstays of various sports teams in their original units or have served as amateur instructors and referees for the teams and sports teams. They have played a key and promotional role in the development of sports activities in their original units. (Cui Yinshan) (Attached picture)

　  培养体育运动的后备军
　　全国举办105所青少年业余体育学校
    本报讯　为了开展群众性的体育运动，培养未来的优秀运动员，我国从1955年起即开始在北京、天津、上海等地成立青、少年业余体育学校。截至1957年6月止，在八十六个城市已经建立了一百零五所青、少年业余体育学校（青年二十五所，少年八十所），正在培养着一万零七百二十三名青、少年运动员。青少年业余体育学校开办的运动项目有田径、体操、游泳、足球、篮球、排球、网球、羽毛球、乒乓球、滑冰、滑雪、自行车、举重、跳水、水球、冰球等十六项，其中以田径、体操两个项目为最普遍。
    青少年业余体育学校是利用现有体育场、馆或设备较好的学校、工厂，吸收具有一定运动基础，在原单位学习、工作、品德良好，并有培养前途的青年和少年，在自愿原则下来校学习，这种学校每星期利用三、四小时的业余时间，根据先进的科学理论和教学作业方法来进行教学训练。
    在已经开办的学校中，分为两种类型，一种是综合性的，包括的项目较多，如北京青少年业余体育学校就设立有田径、体操、游泳、足球、篮球、排球等六个科；一种是一个单项的，如吉林的滑雪业余体育学校，天津的游泳业余体育学校。各学校都有兼职或专职校长或教导主任，并有一定数量的专、兼职教练员，这样就保证了经常性的教学训练工作。
    青、少年们经过一年多有组织的教学训练，他们的体质普遍增强了。例如上海市第一少年业余体育学校田径班学生，入学时平均身高一百六十公分、体重一百零八市斤、肺活量三千二百毫升，血压118／66毫米、握力六十八市斤（左右手相加）。一年后身高增到一百六十五公分、体重一百一十五市斤、肺活量四千三百毫升、血压110／64毫米、握力一百一十七市斤，他们的身体机能之所以发展得这样快，是与系统的进行体育教学训练分不开的。此外，青、少年们的运动技术水平也有了显著提高，有很多人达到了等级运动员的标准。例如天津市第一年招收的六百九十名学生，经过一年的教学训练，有五百一十一人达到等级运动员标准，占学生总数76％。北京市青少年业余体育学校少年游泳科三年级学生共有十一人，1956年测验只有一人达到二级运动员水平，但经过一段训练，今年已经全部达到了二级运动员标准。
    经过学习，有些青少年不仅运动成绩有了显著提高，体质普遍增强，而且学业成绩也有了提高，因而在原校被评为优秀学生。还有不少青少年已成为原单位各项运动代表队的主力，或担任了代表队和运动队的业余指导员、裁判员。他们对原单位的体育活动的开展起了骨干作用和推动作用。　（崔印善）（附图片）
