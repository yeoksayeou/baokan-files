Free German Trade Union Federation Presidium Member
Rudi Hauffner's Speech

Dear Comrades and Friends!

Please allow me, on behalf of the Free German Trade Union Federation of the German Democratic Republic and its 5.5 million members, to extend fraternal fighting greetings to the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions and all delegates, as well as to all working people of your country.

The workers and trade union workers of the German Democratic Republic are watching the struggle of the Chinese working people with utmost excitement and fraternal feelings, as well as the enormous scale and rapid speed of the socialist transformation of Chinese industry and commerce.

We are studying the new and unique achievements made by the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Chinese trade unions in their creative work. We highly value the experience you have accumulated during the period of the Chinese socialist revolution. This experience has creatively enriched Marxism-Leninism, flexibly applying Marxist dialectics under the specific conditions of your country.

In formulating the Second Five-Year Plan, the Chinese Communist Party has unfolded broad prospects for the Chinese working people: to transform the People's Republic of China from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country in the shortest possible time.

On behalf of the German working class and its trade union organizations, please allow me to wholeheartedly wish you a victorious realization of this magnificent plan, and assure you of our fraternal support and sympathy.

The workers of the German Democratic Republic, in alliance with the working peasants, seized political power in 1949, wresting the old reactionary regime from the hands of the monopoly capitalists, large landowners, and militarists who had twice plunged Germany and the world into the horrors of war. We had a hard time then, with many difficulties, and life was not yet prosperous; however, as a result of our efforts, material and cultural life has improved more than ever before.

Our trade union has set itself the task of cultivating more talents in the working class during the transition period from capitalism to communism, so that the working class, under the leadership of its political party—the Socialist Unity Party of Germany—can better lead the country's economic construction. We regard the trade union as a school of communism, striving to raise the working class's awareness of its historical role, unswervingly safeguarding the interests of workers, employees, and intellectuals, and enabling the working people and their trade unions to establish the closest ties with the working-class political party.

Our republic is located on the western border of the socialist camp. There is a dividing line in central Germany that abnormally splits our country. German militarism has been revived under the protection of American monopoly organizations, and now it is the most serious threat of war in central Europe. Monopoly capital is the international enemy of the working class.

The resolutions of the Fourth World Trade Union Congress also pointed this out. We fully agree with the resolutions of this congress and will do everything in our power to promote the unity of world workers' action, because this unity is the only force to stop imperialist aggression plans and victoriously strive for peace and socialist progress. The direct task facing German workers and their trade unions is to establish unified action to deal with West German monopoly capital; West German monopoly capital is preparing new aggression and has already begun a new offensive against West German workers, with the aim of shifting the burden of military preparations for a new world war onto the workers.

In the struggle against West German militarism and revanchism, German workers are realizing their great task—striving for the reunification of Germany and making it a peaceful, democratic, and anti-imperialist country, and guaranteeing peace in Europe. When German workers are fighting, we believe that we will receive the support of workers in Europe and around the world, because our struggle is in the interests of workers around the world.

We have a common enemy, we must defeat it together. We have common interests, and we can only realize these interests through close cooperation in battle and fraternal unity in striving for the unity of workers of all countries. At the Fourth World Trade Union Congress, our common task of victoriously striving for peace, democracy, and socialism was determined. No force in the world can hinder the progress of mankind and the arrival of the victory of socialism.

However, there are forces in the world that can stop war and defend peace. Therefore, we must consolidate our fraternal friendship and the unity of the working class around the world.

Long live the friendship between the German people and the people of the powerful People's Republic of China!

Long live the powerful world socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China!

Long live world peace!

    自由德国工会联合会主席团委员
    鲁廸·海波涅尔致词亲爱的同志们和朋友们！
    请允许我代表德意志民主共和国自由德国工会联合会及其五百五十万会员，向中国工会第八次全国代表大会和全体代表以及你们国家的全体劳动者，致以兄弟般的战斗的敬礼。
    德意志民主共和国的工人和工会工作者以极其兴奋和兄弟的心情注视着中国劳动人民的斗争，注视着中国工商业社会主义改造的巨大规模和飞快的速度。
    我们正在研究中国人民、中国共产党和中国工会在创造性的工作中所取得的新的独特的成就，我们非常珍视你们在中国社会主义革命时期所积累的经验，这些经验创造性地丰富了马列主义，灵活地在你们国家的具体条件之下应用了马克思主义辩证法。
    在制订第二个五年计划时，中国共产党为中国劳动人民展开了广阔的远景，要在最短时间之内，把中华人民共和国从落后的农业国改变成为先进的工业国。
    请允许我代表德国工人阶级及其工会组织衷心地祝你们这个宏伟的计划胜利实现，并保证给你们以兄弟般的支援和同情。
    德意志民主共和国的工人与劳动农民结成联盟，于1949年取得了政权，夺取了曾经两次使德国与全世界陷入战争恐怖的垄断资本家、大地主、军国主义分子的旧的反动政权。我们当时很艰苦，困难很多，生活还不富裕；然而，由于我们努力的结果，物质、文化生活较以前任何时期都提高了。
    我们工会给自己提出了这样的任务：在从资本主义到共产主义的过渡时期，培养工人阶级具有更多的才能，以便工人阶级在自己的政党——德国统一社会党的领导下，能更好地领导国家的经济建设。我们把工会看做共产主义的学校，努力提高工人阶级对自己历史作用的认识，坚持不渝地捍卫工人、职员和知识分子的利益，并使劳动人民及其工会得以同工人阶级政党建立最密切的联系。
    我们的共和国位于社会主义阵营的西陲。德国中部有一条界线，这条界线反常地分裂了我国。德国的军国主义在美国垄断组织的庇护下复活了，现在，它是欧洲中部最严重的战争威胁。垄断资本是工人阶级的国际敌人。
    世界工会第四次代表大会的决议也指出了这一点。我们完全同意这次大会的决议，并要尽一切力量促使世界工人行动达到统一，因为这种统一是制止帝国主义的侵略计划和胜利地争取和平和社会主义进步的唯一力量。德国工人及其工会面前的直接任务，就是建立统一行动以对付西德垄断资本；西德垄断资本正在准备着新的侵略，而且业已开始向西德工人发起新的进攻，其目的是要把发动新的世界大战的军备负担转嫁到工人身上。
    在反对西德军国主义和复仇主义的斗争中，德国工人实现着自己伟大的任务——争取德国的重新统一，并使之成为一个爱好和平的、民主的、反帝国主义的国家，以及保证欧洲的和平。德国工人在进行斗争的时候，我们相信会得到欧洲和全世界工人的支持，因为我们的斗争符合于全世界工人的利益。
    我们有共同的敌人，我们必须共同打败它。我们有共同的利益，我们只有在战斗中紧密合作和兄弟般地团结起来争取各国工人的团结，才能实现这个利益。在世界工会第四次代表大会上，确定了我们胜利地争取和平、民主和社会主义的共同任务。世界上没有任何力量能阻碍人类的进步和社会主义的胜利到来。
    然而，世界上有能够制止战争、保卫和平的力量。因此，我们必须巩固我们兄弟般的友谊和全世界工人阶级的团结。
    德国人民和强大的中华人民共和国人民之间的友谊万岁！
    以苏联和中华人民共和国为首的强大的世界社会主义阵营万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
