    新华社太原27日电　太原市各国营厂矿和基本建设单位大体上做好了迎接1958年新任务的准备工作。各单位明年第一季度的计划下达车间以后，职工们正在讨论，纷纷制订保证条件和竞赛条件。
    明年太原市国营厂矿的生产计划和基本建设单位的建设任务，一般比1957年提高10％左右，新产品的试制任务增加更多。太原重型机器厂、山西机床厂等九个单位明年要试制的新产品就有七十六种。各单位在整风的同时，加强了对明年生产建设准备工作的领导。大部分单位都由厂长或副厂长、总工程师等领导，组织一定的力量，专门负责编制计划、制订技术组织措施、调整劳动组织、检修机器设备等准备工作。
    工作进展较快的太原矿山机器厂从今年第三季度就开始为明年生产做准备。太原机车车辆修理工厂，根据明年的生产任务，合并了车间，还增加了机床和工具。这个厂不少的工人已开始做明年的工作。
