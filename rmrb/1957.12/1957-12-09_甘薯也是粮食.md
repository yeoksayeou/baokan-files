Sweet Potatoes Are Also Grain

    Henan Province's sweet potato unified purchase work has been slow this year. As of November 20, the province had completed less than 40% of its task. Among them, the four special districts of Nanyang, Kaifeng, Luoyang, and Anyang have not even reached 10% of their assigned tasks. However, there are also those who have completed it well, such as the Shangqiu Special District, which had completed 73% of its unified purchase task by November 15.

    Why is the progress of work in the four special districts of Nanyang, Kaifeng, etc., so far behind that of Shangqiu? The fundamental reason is that rural work cadres in these areas have this kind of thinking: "As long as the grain purchase task is completed, it doesn't matter if the sweet potato task is not completed."

      "Sweet potatoes are half a year's grain." The position of sweet potatoes in China's grain production is very important. In the major producing areas of Shandong, Hebei, and Henan, the sweet potato planting area accounts for 8% of the total area of ​​grain crops, and the output accounts for 17% of the total grain output. Farmers in northern regions and dryland areas in the south have 20% to 50% of their food rations as sweet potatoes. Why do we say "it doesn't matter if the sweet potato task is not completed"?

    "As long as the grain purchase task is completed, it doesn't matter if the sweet potato task is not completed." This is the ideological root cause of the poor completion of the sweet potato unified purchase task in the four special districts of Nanyang and others. However, what is the root of this ideological root cause? There is only one answer: are sweet potatoes grain or not?

### 甘薯也是粮食

　　甘薯也是粮食
    河南省今年甘薯统购工作进度缓慢，截至11月20日为止，全省完成的任务还不到40％，其中南阳、开封、洛阳、安阳四个专区，还没有达到分配任务的10％。但是，也有完成得好的，如商丘专区截至11月15日就完成了统购任务的73％。
    南阳、开封等四个专区的工作进度为什么比商丘差这么远呢？根本原因就是这些地区的农村工作干部存在这样一种思想——“只要完成了粮食征购任务，甘薯任务完不成没啥。”
      “甘薯半年粮。”甘薯在我国粮食生产中的地位是很重要的。在山东、河北、河南几个主要产区，甘薯种植面积占粮食作物总面积8％，产量占粮食总产量的17％。北方地区和南方的旱作地区的农民有20％至50％的口粮是甘薯，为什么说“甘薯任务完不成没啥”呢？
    “只要完成了粮食征购任务，甘薯任务完不成没啥。”这是南阳等四个专区甘薯统购任务完成得不好的思想根源。但是，这种思想根源的根源又是什么呢？只有一个——甘薯是不是粮食。
