Be Humble, Be More Humble!
Che Jianzhi

My social circle isn't wide, but I do have a few friends. Some of these friends are editors at newspapers, others are cadres in government offices. They all share a common trait: they love literature and art, and some even aspire to become writers in the future. Recently, I had the opportunity to visit them, and they all, coincidentally, poured out their grievances to me, all concerning the issue of submitting manuscripts.

The friend who works as an editor said with great emotion, "Some young contributors today have quite the high and mighty attitude! They seem to have never considered how high the sky is or how thick the earth is!" Then he cited a few examples.

A young reader submitted a manuscript to a newspaper supplement, saying in an accompanying letter: "I am a person with extremely poor literary skills... Some time ago, I submitted a manuscript to a publication, which was returned with a printed note saying 'unsuitable for publication.' Their publication doesn't need new blood. These shameful fools! These arrogant fellows!"

A young man who had published a few lines of poetry wrote a letter questioning the editor, saying that a poem published in the newspaper was plagiarized from him because his poem contained the phrase "American helmet," and this poem also had it. He attached a photo of his poem, saying that this poem had been reprinted in this publication and that publication, and the publication time was long ago, so this "plagiarist" and the editor could not have failed to see it, and so on. The editor checked and found that the content and sentences of the two poems were completely different, with only the four words "American helmet" being the same.

As for the friends working in government offices, they also had grievances. One friend said, "My ambition is to become an amateur writer, so I often use my spare time to write manuscripts and send them to newspapers, but they are always returned. I want them to answer: Do amateur authors have to join an organization like the 'Writers Association' to have their works published?"

Another friend said, "I racked my brains to write a manuscript, but the editorial department always returns it, returns it!"

My friends' discussions sparked some thoughts in me, reminding me of Chairman Mao's instruction: "Modesty helps one to progress, while conceit makes one lag behind."

The examples above illustrate a common problem: it is difficult to say that some young people are humble. Some initially "humbly" claim to be "people with extremely poor literary skills," but when their manuscripts are not adopted, they scold the editors as "shameful fools" and "arrogant fellows." Some become arrogant after publishing a few lines of poetry, showing off everywhere and even taking photos of their "works." Some insist that the editors publish their unsightly exercises, and some even say that their works are not published because they are not members of the Writers Association! Can these be considered expressions of humility?

Wanting to aspire to be a writer and practicing writing in spare time, I don't think anyone objects. But just starting to practice writing, and being eager to publish what is written by "racking one's brains," and then scolding the editor for "not valuing new blood" when it is not published, is a bit too much!

As the saying goes, "A full pot makes no sound, but a half pot clangs." These young friends are still empty "pots" now, but they are already arrogant and making clanging noises. What will happen when they become "half pots" or more than "half pots"?

Many people who have embarked on the anti-Party and anti-socialist road due to extreme and serious individualism have been exposed in the newspapers and should be taken as a mirror. Among the above-mentioned young friends, some are determined to become writers, so let's take writers as an example. The so-called "internationally renowned" "writers" Ding Ling and Ai Qing, and the so-called "child prodigy" writer Liu Shaotang, were they not all right-wing elements who fell because of extreme arrogance and conceit? Especially the fact of Liu Shaotang's fall, is even more worthy of these young friends' deep thought and reflection. I sincerely hope that these friends who aspire to be writers but are not yet writers, will draw lessons from this, and the most important thing is to be humble, be more humble!

    虚心些，再虚心些！
    车鉴之
    我的交游虽不广，朋友倒还有几个。这些朋友有的在报社做编辑，有的是机关干部，他们有一个共同的特点：都喜爱文艺，有的还想将来当作家。最近有机会去拜访了他们，谁知他们都不约而同地向我发了一阵牢骚，而且都是关于投稿问题的。
    那个做编辑的朋友感慨万分的说：“现在有的青年投稿者派头可不小呀，天有多高，地有多厚，他们似乎从来没有考虑过！”接着他举了几个例子。
    一个青年读者向报纸副刊投稿，在附信中说：“我是一个文学水平极差的人……前些时候我向一个刊物投了一篇稿子，竟被附上‘不能刊用’的油印信退回来了。他们的刊物不需要新生力量。这些可耻的蠢物！这些骄傲的家伙！”
    一个发表过几行诗作的青年写信质问编辑，说报上登的一首诗是抄袭他的，因为他的诗里写有“美国钢盔”，而这首诗里也有。并附来他那首诗的照片，说这首诗曾被这个刊物那个刊物转载过，发表时间已很久，这个“抄袭者”和编辑同志不可能没见到云云。编辑查对了一下，两首诗的内容、句子完全不同，相同的只有“美国钢盔”四个字。
    至于在机关工作的几个朋友也有牢骚。一个朋友说：“我的志愿是想当一个业余作家，因此经常用业余时间写稿寄给报社，但都被退回来了。我要他们解答：业余作者是否要参加像‘作家协会’这样的组织才能发表作品呢？”
    另一个朋友说：“我搜索枯肠写成稿子，但编辑部总是退回，退回！”
    朋友们的议论倒引起了我的一点感想，使我想起了毛主席的“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”的指示。
    上面举的一些例子说明了一个共同的问题：对于有些青年人很难说他们是虚心的。有的开始虽“自谦”为“文学水平极差的人”，但当他的稿子未被采用时，就骂编辑为“可耻的蠢物”、“骄傲的家伙”；有的发表过几行诗就不可一世，到处炫耀，还把他的“作品”拍了照，有的硬要编辑发表他不像样子的习作，有的竟说他的作品没有发表是因为不是作家协会的会员！这些能算是虚心的表现么？
    要立志当作家，在业余时间练习写作，我想没有人反对。但是刚开始练习写作，把“搜索枯肠”写成的东西，就要急于发表，发表不成，就骂编辑“不重视新生力量”，这就未免太过份了！
    俗话说，“满壶全不响，半壶响叮噹”。这些青年朋友现在还是“壶”内空空的时候，就已经狂妄自大，发出叮噹之声，当他们成了“半壶”或者超过“半壶”时又将如何呢？
    由于有极端严重的个人主义而走上反党、反社会主义道路的人，报纸上已经揭发了许多，应当当做镜子照照。上述几位青年朋友中，有的是立志当作家的，我们就以作家为例吧，所谓“国际著名”的“作家”丁玲和艾青，所谓“神童”作家刘绍棠，不正都是因为极端狂妄自大而堕落成为右派分子的么？尤其是刘绍棠堕落的事实，更值得这些青年朋友们深思细想。我衷心地希望这些立志做作家而现在还不是作家的朋友们，要从这里吸取教训，特别重要的是要虚心些，再虚心些！
