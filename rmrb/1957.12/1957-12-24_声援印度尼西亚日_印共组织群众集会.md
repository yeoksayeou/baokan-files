    “Support Indonesia Day”
    Communist Party of India Organizes Mass Rally
Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 23rd: General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, Ajoy Ghosh, stated at a mass rally held in Delhi City Hall on the afternoon of the 22nd that Indonesia is fully entitled to take decisive steps against Dutch imperialists. This rally was organized by the Delhi branch of the Communist Party of India in response to the call from the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of India to hold a “Support Indonesia Day.”
    The rally unanimously passed a resolution demanding that the Indian government fully support Indonesia's struggle to "eliminate all traces of Dutch imperialism." The resolution pointed out that the reason Dutch imperialism "clings to West Irian is the same as the reason Portugal clings to Goa and the Americans cling to Taiwan," because imperialists want to use these bases to threaten the rise of Asia.
    "Support Indonesia Day" activities were also held in many other places in India.

    “声援印度尼西亚日”
    印共组织群众集会
  据新华社新德里23日电　印度共产党总书记高士22日下午在德里市政大厅举行的一次群众集会上说，印度尼西亚完全有权对荷兰帝国主义者采取断然步骤。这次集会是印度共产党德里组织为了响应印度共产党中央委员会政治局关于举行“声援印度尼西亚日”的号召而组织的。
    这次集会一致通过了一项决议，要求印度政府完全支持印度尼西亚为“消灭荷兰帝国主义的一切痕迹”而作的斗争。决议指出，荷兰帝国主义“死抓住西伊里安不放的原因，同葡萄牙抓住果阿和美国人抓住台湾不放的原因是一样的”，因为帝国主义分子要利用这些基地来威胁亚洲的兴起。
    在印度其他许多地方也举行了“声援印度尼西亚日”。
