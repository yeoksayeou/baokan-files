Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 25th: The "Saturday Evening Post" recently published a "Confession of an Assessor," introducing the oral record of an "assessor" from Delaware County, Indiana.

The article stated: In addition to real estate, the "assessor" also "assesses" household items every year on March 1st, taxing almost everything visible (and some things not visible), including televisions, complete sets of golf equipment, electric lawnmowers, and cash in bank accounts (if the taxpayer has savings). If an assessor sees a puppy near a home, they will also collect a "dog tax."

The author of the article said: In Delaware County, there are a total of one hundred and twenty-five male and female assessors, most of whom go door-to-door to "assess" properties during the assessment period from March 1st to 15th. They can calculate the value of 145 million US dollars of property in a small county for the purpose of taxation. The author said: People who do this job must have "a face as thick as an elephant's hide."

The author said that he was shocked by the poverty he saw in the shantytowns and slum alleys. He once went to a slum to "assess" property. He walked into what seemed to be a coal shed, but inside lived five or six children playing on the filthy floor, a young woman breastfeeding a baby, and an old grandmother. The old grandmother was using an overturned empty bucket as a surface to make pancakes. The assessor only stayed inside for a minute or two and wrote down the cheapest possible valuation on the assessment form for the household's contents: twenty-five dollars.

    美国万税
    据新华社25日讯　纽约消息：“星期六晚邮报”不久以前刊载了一篇“估税员的自白”，介绍印第安纳州特拉华县一个“估税员”的口述记录。
    文章说：除了房地产以外，“估税员”每年3月1日还要对居民家中什物用具“估税”，对差不多一切看得到的东西（有些还是看不见的东西）都要估税，其中包括电视机、高尔夫球全套设备、电动割草机和存在银行的现款（如果纳税人有存款的话）。估税员如果在哪家附近看见小狗，还要征收“狗税”。
    文章的作者说：在特拉华县一共有一百二十五名男女估税员，他们大多数在3月1日到15日的估税期间挨家逐户地去“估税”。他们在一个小小的县份能算出价值一亿四千五百万美元的财产，以便征税。作者说：干这一行的人必须有“像大象一样厚的脸皮”。
    作者说，他在棚户区和小巷里贫民区中看到的贫困现象使他吃惊。他曾到一个贫民窟中去“估税”，他走进一个仿佛是堆煤的棚屋内，但是里面却住着五六个在污秽的地板上嬉戏的孩子，一个正在给婴儿喂奶的年青妇女和一个老祖母。老祖母把一个空桶倒放着，在那上面作面饼。估税员只在里面停留了一两分钟，就在这家的室内用具的估税单上写下了最便宜的估价：二十五元。
