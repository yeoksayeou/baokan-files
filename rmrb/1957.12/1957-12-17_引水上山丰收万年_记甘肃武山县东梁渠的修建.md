Drawing Water Up the Mountain for Ten Thousand Years of Bumper Harvests
　　——A Record of the Construction of the Dongliang Canal in Wushan County, Gansu
    Gu Lei
    The farmers of Dongliang Mountain in Wushan County, Gansu Province, used their own financial and material resources, and utilized their slack farming season to build the sixty-li-long Dongliang Canal, drawing water from the Nie River through mountains and across ravines to irrigate the land on the mountain, which is more than 1,900 meters above sea level. If viewed as a natural phenomenon, this canal is merely a small stream compared to the great rivers, with a flow rate of only 0.7 cubic meters per second, which is insignificant. However, viewed as a phenomenon of the struggle between man and nature, it is a huge wave of farmers pursuing a happy life, boldly creating, and turning ancient fantasies into reality! At the same time, it is also a banner, a banner calling on people to march towards drought. This banner should be held high by the people of all arid regions!

    Bold Imagination
    Drought was the greatest misfortune for the people of Wushan in the past. Ninety percent of the county's area is high mountains, large ridges, hills, and ravines. The annual rainfall is less than 500 millimeters, which is not much more than the sweat shed by the farmers.

    Dongliang Mountain is located in the central part of Wushan County. Like many mountainous areas, the amount of rainfall has always determined the joy and suffering of farmers for many years. A year of hard work for farmers is a year of hoping for rain. Farmers are constantly looking for the hope of a bumper harvest from every cloud floating in the sky, but often they hang their heads low. Drought has made people displaced. In Baijiashan, located at the top of Dongliang Mountain, before liberation, more than seventy households had twenty-four households living by begging, and several others were displaced in other places! Drought has made people engage in heavy and painful labor. Farmers in Baijiashan had to go down the mountain two or three li to fetch water for drinking and livestock. The mountain was steep and the slope was slippery, making it difficult and dangerous. The whole village spent at least 10,000 workdays a year on fetching water and other things. Drought has made people's lives bleak. A song goes like this:

    Poor North Mountain, rich South Mountain, no suffering compares to Dongliang Mountain;
    Fetching water and grinding flour requires going down the mountain, no one wants to marry a girl from Baijiashan!

    This song has been circulating for many years. In those days, people used to look at Yunwu Mountain in the south, longing for a clear spring in that cloud-locked and misty place. There is a legend that reveals the farmers' desperate emotions: The Old Lord saw the suffering of the farmers and built a water mill on the mountainside, drawing water up the mountain. One day, the Old Lord went for a walk on the mountain and met a shepherd boy. The Old Lord asked with great interest, "Child, have you seen the water going up the mountain?" The shepherd boy did not believe that water could go up the mountain, and he had not actually seen the water going up the mountain. He thought the old man was joking with him, so he mischievously said, "It just came up and went down again!" The Old Lord was very angry, thinking that the shepherd boy did not know his hard work, so he left. Since then, the water has never gone up the mountain again, leaving only traces of the water mill on the mountainside. The farmers thought: If the Old Lord could not draw water up the mountain, who else would be more capable than him!

    After liberation, the farmers of five townships and nine agricultural cooperatives in Dongliang Mountain changed their impoverished lives. However, when they yearned for a better life, they thought of water again. Without water, poverty cannot be completely eradicated.

    In recent years, the Wushan County Committee of the Communist Party of China has been leading farmers to fight drought. In order to permanently get rid of the threat of drought, the slogan "Eliminate dry plains, bring paddy fields up the mountain" was put forward. The farmers of Dongliang Mountain picked up the fantasies they had abandoned for many years, and their eyes saw Yunwu Mountain again. This mountain is the source of the Nie River, and the water source is higher than Dongliang Mountain. Dongliang Mountain stretches for more than forty li from north to south, and the southern end is connected to Yunwu Mountain. If a large canal is opened on Dongliang Mountain, diverting a stream of water from the source of the Nie River, flowing from south to north, more than 30,000 mu of land on Dongliang Mountain can be turned into paddy fields.

    This is a very bold imagination, and also an ideal full of difficulties. To bring water from Yunwu Mountain to Dongliang Mountain, the canal needs to be sixty li long, winding and turning, crossing forty mountain streams, passing through four forests, passing through more than one hundred meters of cliffs, passing through dangerous sections such as Xun'er Cliff, Yama's Plaque, Ghost Gate Pass, and Muddy Beach, sixty drop structures need to be built, more than one hundred meters of culverts need to be dug, and eighteen flood-crossing bridges and culverts need to be built. According to normal construction methods, building such a large canal requires many conditions. For example, accurate topographic surveys, key geological exploration data, complete designs, careful plans, strong construction teams, and a large amount of building materials. At that time, water conservancy engineering technicians who visited the Dongliang Canal believed that even with the above conditions, it would still be difficult to build this canal. They even doubted whether the water could be controlled on steep mountain slopes and irrigated smoothly. They worriedly said, "Water is a dragon, flowing from high to low. One careless move and it will create a big hole."

    Entrusting a Magic Weapon

    So, what were the construction conditions facing Wushan County? Very simple: the wishes of the masses, two water conservancy section chiefs who had not studied water conservancy technology, one level, and the tall Yunwu Mountain. At this time, there were two paths to take: one was to build, and the other was not to build. The Wushan County Committee of the Communist Party of China chose the first path and was determined to lead the farmers to build the canal well. This is a resolution full of revolutionary spirit. This resolution came from the leadership's high sympathy for the suffering of the masses, from the Party organization's sense of responsibility for the people's lives, from the trust in the strength and wisdom of the masses, and from seeing the joyful faces of thousands of farmers behind them with ideals. This is all the wealth for building the Dongliang Canal. Then, the County Committee entrusted the task of leading the construction of the Dongliang Canal to two water conservancy section chiefs, without giving them money or materials, but only giving them a magic weapon: "Go, and discuss with the masses when you encounter difficulties!"

    Water Conservancy Section Chief Wang Jian and Deputy Section Chief Li Hua had not studied water conservancy. When the farmers of Liangshan saw Li Hua, they said, "It's him, he used to harvest wheat with us. He has learned his skills!" In fact, Li Hua didn't have any great skills, he just knew how to use a level for simple topographic surveys.

    The first thing they did was to select the route. This was simply unbelievable. Li Hua led a few people, carrying a level, and ran all over Dongliang Mountain, measuring here and looking there. Many times, Li Hua set up the level on the hillside opposite Dongliang Mountain, leaving a few people on the canal line, and both sides waved red flags and blew whistles, and inserted stake numbers after giving a signal. In two days, the entire sixty-li canal line was measured. However, some farmers did not believe that water could go up the mountain. Some people said, "Such a long road, such a big mountain, wanting water to go up the mountain is as impossible as a long vine on a rolling hill, a horse growing horns, or a crow growing red ears!" It was a big deal that the farmers didn't believe it. If this ideological problem was not resolved, the farmers would not work hard. What to do! Wang Jian and Li Hua remembered the words "discuss with the masses." So they organized many old farmers to inspect the measured route and let everyone express their opinions. The farmers were very happy. Some used iron shovel handles to measure back and forth, some ran up and down the hillside to observe with their eyes, some set up tripods and leaned over to compare, all using "local" methods. Running from the north end of Dongliang Mountain to Yunwu Mountain, everyone said that water could go up the mountain. As soon as they said "Let's do it!", more than 1,500 people started construction on the first section of nine kilometers. Including route selection and training of key personnel, it took only five days.

    The start of the Dongliang Canal was actually the beginning of the struggle against various difficulties. Later, every step encountered seemingly difficult technical problems. However, these problems were thrown out of the canal by the farmers like digging dirt. Solving each problem was a kind of creation, and this creation ran through the entire process of canal construction.

    To build the dam for the water intake, there were only stones, no cement, and no money to buy it. Wang Jian asked the farmers what to do, and they replied that there were plenty of ways. As a result, they piled large stones and laid a layer of turf on top. The water entered the gaps in the stones, wetting the turf, and the grass grew out of the gaps, like green velvet, tightly hugging the stones. When building culverts, underground canals, and drops, the farmers simply didn't use turf at all, but built them entirely with stones. The farmers called the former "turf stones" and the latter "dry-laid stones," but both had a common saying: "Shoot cement."

    The Masses Have Many Methods

    The canal was suddenly cut off by a mountain stream. The mountain stream was forty-two meters wide and twenty-two meters deep. It was impossible to fill it in, because they couldn't find enough dirt, and the workload was too great. They wanted to build a large bridge, but they didn't have reinforced concrete, and no one knew how to design it. Wang Jian invited twenty-three carpenters to discuss together. They studied and studied, but didn't have many good ideas. "Hey! Anyway, this task is entrusted to you all. Whether the water can go up the mountain depends on you. You must come up with a solution." After Wang Jian finished speaking, he went elsewhere. This made the old carpenter Lin Manxu feel bad. As he thought about it, he didn't know why he ran to the railway dozens of miles away. He stood next to a steel beam bridge, carefully observing it, and suddenly had an idea. He ran back to the construction site. In the evening, he discussed with everyone and prepared to use wood as steel beams, learning the method of building bridges to build a wooden bridge. "They have one layer, do we have wood that long?" someone asked. Lin Manxu said: "Then we'll build three layers." Lin Manxu drew a sketch and worked with other carpenters, discussing and working together, and finally built a large wooden bridge, with a trough made of wooden planks on top to lead the water across the mountain stream. The construction of this aqueduct, including labor and materials, cost less than 2,000 yuan and could be used for thirty years. If reinforced concrete were used, 200,000 yuan would not be enough.

    The farmers created and moved forward. When there was no way to climb the cliff, the farmers used ropes to hang themselves in the air to work! The two-foot-long hoes were ground down to four or five inches long. When the tools were gone, they went home to get them. In order to rush the work, they lit torches and worked at night. The canal was like a bustling night market. Someone suggested that a single main canal could not irrigate scattered plots of land, so the farmers thought of ways to open branch canals. The mountain terrain had a slope, and most of the branch canals sloped downwards. The farmers said: "This is called the 'White Horse Dividing Mane' method." Someone else suggested that the canal was sixty li long, and many villages used water. If everyone irrigated the land at the same time, the upstream water volume would be sufficient, but the downstream water volume would be small. What should be done? If the canal broke down, there would be no way to retreat the water, which would damage the land. What should be done? It was necessary to solve the problem of water storage and retreat. The farmers discussed and said that it would be best to dig ponds on both sides of the canal, which could store water and retreat water. As a result, two hundred ponds were dug. The farmers said: "This also has an emphasis, called the 'Long Vine Bearing Melons' method." The farmers thus contributed more than 100,000 workdays, dug nearly 300,000 cubic meters of earth, created dozens of new technologies, and built the Dongliang Canal without asking the state for money.

    The Joy on Dongliang Mountain

    During the days of releasing water, Dongliang Mountain was full of joy. The water flowed from Yunwu Mountain to the end of the canal in eleven hours. The clear water flowed into the village, and the farmers of that village shouted: "The Old Lord did not bring water up the mountain, but the Communist Party led us to bring water up the mountain!" Naughty children jumped into the water and didn't come out, young women secretly washed their feet aside, and the elderly asked others to help them to the canal bank, saying that they had not lived in vain in this life. Soon after the water entered Baijiashan, eight girls from the plains married youths from Baijiashan amid drums and music, and several other couples were looking forward to the wedding day. A new water mill was built in Baijiashan, with new couplets posted on the door. The upper couplet reads: "Build a new mill, permanently consolidate for thousands of years;" the lower couplet reads: "Water goes up the mountain, bumper harvests for ten thousand years." This couplet expresses the joy of the people of Dongliang Mountain and their yearning for the future. Last year, the canal was not fully completed, but several hundred mu of land were irrigated, and a scene of bumper harvest appeared. For the first time in history, farmers in Baijiashan planted hemp, with a yield of 150 jin per mu, equivalent to 1,000 jin of wheat. Farmer Wang Shu used to grow pumpkins with the largest weighing thirty-five jin. After irrigating them with water, the largest weighed seventy-five jin. The farmers of Dongliang Mountain plan to irrigate 30,000 mu of land in 1958. Calculating a minimum increase of fifty jin of grain per mu, the output can be increased by 1.5 million jin. At the same time, they also have better plans: to use the drops on the canal to build small hydropower stations to supply lighting and power; to plant reeds extensively along the canal and ponds, which can protect the canal and ponds, and can also be used for weaving mats; to raise ducks and fish in large quantities in the ponds to increase income. This plan has already started. In this way, the arid and bare Dongliang Mountain will become a "Dongliang River" with water, grass, trees, ponds, and green shade!

    The news of the completion of the Dongliang Canal quickly spread to various parts of Gansu Province. Cadres from many counties led farmers to visit. The leading organs sent people to summarize experience. Water conservancy technicians went to the canal to study. The Dongliang Canal has become a vivid teaching material. It educated cadres, increasing their confidence and determination to lead the masses to overcome drought! It educated farmers, making them see their own strength and no longer shrink back and hesitate in the face of nature! It educated those water conservancy engineering technicians who memorize formulas by rote, making them know who they should rely on to build water conservancy!

    Now, in Tianshui Prefecture alone, thirteen projects similar to the Dongliang Canal have started construction. The Beiliang Canal, jointly opened by farmers from Wushan County and Gangu County, is one hundred kilometers long, with a mountain stream that is one hundred and twenty meters deep and one hundred meters wide. The entire project requires several million workdays. The farmers did not ask the state for money or people. Li Hua is still in charge of surveying, Lin Manxu is still leading the water across the large mountain stream, and the farmers themselves are still contributing money and labor. This winter, the two counties will concentrate 70,000 people to work in the severe cold. In other counties in Gansu Province, the seeds of the Dongliang Canal have also been sown, and more than thirty large canals have already started construction! The Dongliang Canal has opened up a path for water conservancy in mountainous areas. The name of the Dongliang Canal will forever be recorded in the history of water conservancy in China, with its brilliance never ceasing! (Attached pictures)

    The farmers of Dongliang Mountain, who used to buy vegetables from the foot of the mountain, are now supplying vegetables to the foot of the mountain. The largest pumpkin grown by old farmer Wang Shu of Hejiawan weighs more than seventy jin. 　　　　　　　　　Xinhua News Agency reporter Hao Changgeng

　　引水上山丰收万年
　　——记甘肃武山县东梁渠的修建
    顾雷
    甘肃省武山县东梁山的农民，用自己的财力、物力，利用农闲时间，修成一条长六十华里的东梁渠，引聂河的水穿山越涧，浇灌拔海一千九百多公尺高的山上的土地。如果作为一种自然现象看，拿这条渠同大江大河比，不过是条小溪，每秒钟流量只有零点七立方公尺，微不足道。然而作为人和自然斗争的现象看，它却是农民追求幸福生活、大胆进行创造、变古老幻想为现实的大涛大浪！同时也是一面旗帜，是号召人们向干旱进军的旗帜。这面旗帜，应该被所有干旱地区的人民高高举起！
    大胆的想像
    干旱，是武山人民过去最大的不幸。全县90％的面积是高山、大岭、丘壑、沟涧。每年落雨量不到五百公厘，并不比农民流出的汗水多。
    东梁山在武山县中部，同许多山区一样，多少年来雨水的多寡，一直左右着农民的欢乐与痛苦。农民辛勤劳动的一年就是盼雨的一年。农民时刻从空中飘过的每朵云块里寻找丰收的希望，但常常垂下了头。干旱，使人们流离失所。地处东梁山顶的柏家山，解放前七十多户人家，有二十四户靠讨饭过日子，另有几户流落异乡了！干旱，使人们从事沉重、痛苦的劳动。柏家山的农民，吃水、饮牲口，都要跑到二三里路的山下去担，山陡坡滑，吃力而又危险。全村每年用在担水等方面的劳动日至少一万个。干旱，使人们的生活变得暗淡了。有一首歌这样唱道：
    穷北山富南山呀，苦楚较不过东梁山；
    担水磨面要下山呀，有女不嫁柏家山！
    这支歌流传许多年了。在那些日子里，人们曾遥望南面的云雾山，思念那云锁雾衮地方的一口清泉。这里有个传说又流露了农民们绝望的情绪：老君爷看到了农民的苦处，在山腰里修了一座水磨，把水引上了山。这天，老君爷到山上走走，遇见个放羊娃。老君爷兴致勃勃地问：“孩子，看见水上山了没有？”放羊娃是不相信水会上山的，也确实没有看见上了山的水，以为老头和自己开玩笑呢，便调皮地说：“刚上来，又下去了！”老君爷很生气，以为放羊娃不知道自己的辛苦，便扬长而去。从此，水再也没有上山，只在山腰里留下了水磨的痕迹。农民们想：老君爷没有把水引上山，还有谁比他有本事呢！
    解放以后，东梁山五个乡、九个农业社的农民，改变了贫困的生活。但是，当他们向往更美好生活的时候，又想到了水。没有水，不能彻底赶走贫困。
    这些年来，中共武山县委一直在领导农民进行抗旱。为了永远摆脱干旱的威胁，提出了“消灭旱川，水田上山”的口号。东梁山的农民，又拾起丢掉了多年的幻想，眼睛重新看到了云雾山。这个山是聂河的发源地，水源比东梁山高。东梁山由北到南，绵延四十余里，南端同云雾山相接。如果在东梁山上开一条大渠，从水源处把聂河的水分出一股，由南向北流，可以使东梁山上的三万多亩土地变成水田。
    这是个十分大胆的想像，也是个充满困难的理想。把云雾山的水引到东梁山，渠道要曲折蜿蜒六十里，越过四十条山涧，穿过四座森林，通过一百多公尺长的悬崖峭壁，经过熏儿崖、阎王匾、鬼门关、烂泥滩等险要地段，要修六十座跌水，打暗渠一百多公尺，建筑渡洪桥和涵洞十八座。依照正常的施工方法，建筑这样大的渠，需要有很多条件。例如，精确的地形测量，重点地质钻探资料，完整的设计，周密的计划，强大的施工队伍，大量的建筑材料。当时，到东梁渠参观的水利工程技术人员，还认为即使具备了上面那些条件，想建成这条渠仍然是困难的。他们甚至怀疑，在坡度很大的山地上，能不能把水控制住，顺利地进行浇灌。他们耽心地说：“水是一条龙，从高往低行，一个不小心，冲个大窟窿。”
    交给一件法宝
    那末，摆在武山县面前的施工条件是什么呢？非常简单：群众的愿望，两个没有学过水利技术的水利科长，一台水平仪，高大的云雾山。这时，有两条路可走：一是修，一是不修。中共武山县委，选择了头一条路，下决心领导农民把渠修好。这是一个充满革命气魄的决心。这决心，来自领导对群众疾苦的高度同情，来自党组织对人民生活的责任感，来自对群众力量和智慧的信任，来自看到身后千万个农民有了理想后喜悦的面孔。这就是修建东梁渠的全部财富。接着，县委把领导修建东梁渠的任务交给了两位水利科长，没有给他们钱，也没有给他们材料，只交给他们一件法宝：“去吧，遇见困难去同群众商量！”
    水利科长汪鉴和副科长李华都没有学过水利。在梁山的农民看见李华说：“是他呀，和我们一起割过麦子。学会本事啦！”其实，李华没有什么大本事，只是会用水平仪进行简单的地形测量。
    他们进行的头一件事是选线。这简直是令人难以置信的事。李华领着几个人，扛着一台水平仪，跑遍东梁山，这里量量，那里看看。有很多时候，李华将水平仪架在东梁山对面的山坡上，留几个人在渠道线上，双方又摇红旗，又吹哨子，打个信号就插上了桩号。两天，把六十里渠道线全部测量完毕。可是，有些农民不相信水可以上山。有人说：“这么远的路，这么大的山，想水上山除非辘辘长蔓、马长角、乌鸦长出红耳朵！”农民不相信是件大事情，不解决这个思想问题，农民是不会好好劳动的。怎么办呢！汪鉴和李华想起了“同群众商量”这句话。于是组织许多老农民，沿测量好的线路察看，让大家发表意见。农民很高兴，有的用铁锨把子量来量去，有的在山坡上跑上跑下用眼端详，有的扎上三角架伏身在上面比划，全用的“土”办法。从东梁山北头，跑到云雾山，大家都说水可以上山。说声干，一千五百多人在第一段九公里的线路上动工了。连选线加训练骨干，不过五天时间。
    东梁渠的开工，实际上是向各种困难斗争的开始。以后，每一步都在技术上遇到似乎不易解决的难题。然而，这些难题在农民面前，却像挖土一样，被扔出渠道之外了。每解决一个难题就是一种创造，这种创造贯穿了修渠的全部过程。
    要砌入水口的坝，只有石块，没有洋灰，也没有钱买。汪鉴问农民怎么办，答应说，有的是办法。结果，砌一块大石头，上铺一层草皮。水进入石缝，浸湿了草皮，草从石缝里长出来，像绿色的丝绒，紧紧地把石块抱住。到砌涵洞、暗渠、跌水的时候，农民索性连草皮都不用了，全用石块砌筑。农民称前者是“草皮石头”，后者是“干砌块石”，但两者有一个共同的说法：“枪毙洋灰”。
    群众办法很多
    渠道突然被一个山涧截断了。山涧宽四十二公尺，深二十二公尺。想填平，找不到土，工作量也太大。想修大桥，没有钢筋混凝土，也没有人会设计。汪鉴请了二十三个木工在一起讨论。研究来，研究去，没有多少好的办法。“嗨！反正这个任务交给你们大伙了，水能不能上山就看你们了，一定要想出办法。”汪鉴说完这句话，又到别处去了。这可难坏了老木工林满绪。他想着想着，不知为什么竟跑到几十里以外的铁路上去了。他站在一座钢梁桥旁边，仔细打量，灵机一动，突然跑回工地。晚上，他同大伙商量，准备用木头当钢梁，学着架桥的办法搭一座木桥。“人家那是一层，咱们有那样长的木头吗？”有人问。林满绪说：“那就架三层。”林满绪划了草图，同其他木工一起，一边商量，一边干，终于搭起了一座大木桥，上面安上用木板做成的槽，把水引过了山涧。修这个渡槽，连工带料花了不到两千元，能用三十年，如果用钢筋混凝土，二十万元也是不够的。
    农民们一边创造，一边前进。没有办法爬上悬崖，农民用根绳子，从山上把自己吊在半空里干！两尺多长的镐头，磨得剩下四五寸长，工具没有了，回家去拿。为了赶工，点上火把带夜干。渠道像繁华的夜市。有人提出，单靠一道干渠，浇不了零星的土地，农民就想办法开支渠。山地有坡度，支渠大都向下倾斜。农民说：“这叫白马分鬃法”，又有人提出，渠道长六十里，许多村子用水，如果大家一起浇地，上游水量足，下游水量小，怎么办呢？如果渠道发生了故障，渠里的水没有退路，会把地冲坏，怎么办呢？必须解决蓄水、退水的问题。农民们一商量，说在渠两旁打塘最好，又能蓄水，又能退水。结果，打了二百个塘。农民说：“这也有讲究，叫做长藤结瓜法”。农民就这样支付了十余万个劳动工作日，挖了近三十万立方公尺的土，创造了几十种新技术，没有要国家的钱，把东梁渠修成了。
    东梁山上的喜悦
    放水的日子里，东梁山上一片欢腾。水，由云雾山到渠梢，流十一个小时。清澈的水，流到那个村子，那个村子的农民就高呼：“老君爷都没有把水引上山，共产党领导我们把水引上山了！”顽皮的孩子跳进水里不出来，年青的妇女偷着在一旁洗脚，老年人找人扶着走到渠边，说这一辈子没有白过。水进了柏家山不久，有八个川地的姑娘在鼓乐声中嫁给了柏家山的青年，还有几对正盼着结婚的日子。柏家山新修了一座水磨，门上贴上了新对联。上联是：修新磨永固千秋；下联是：水上山丰收万年。这副对联，说出了东梁山人民的喜悦和对未来的向往。去年，渠道没有全部竣工，浇灌了几百亩土地，出现了一片丰收的气象。柏家山农民有史以来第一次种大麻，亩产一百五十斤，等于一千斤小麦。农民汪树，往年种南瓜最大的一
  个三十五斤，灌了水以后，最大的一个七十五斤。东梁山的农民，计划1958年浇三万亩地，以每亩最低增产五十斤粮计算，可增产一百五十万斤。同时，他们还有更美好的计划：利用渠道上的跌水，建设小型水电站，供给照明和动力用电；渠边、塘边大量种植芦苇，既可护渠和塘，又可用来编席；池塘内大量养鸭、养鱼，增加收入。这个计划，已着手进行。这样，干旱的、光秃秃的东梁山，就会变成有水有草、有树有塘、绿荫满山的“东梁川”了！
    东梁渠建成的消息，迅速传到甘肃省各地。许多县的干部，带领农民去参观。领导机关，派人去总结经验。水利技术人员，到渠上学习。东梁渠变成了一分生动的教材。它教育干部增加了领导群众战胜干旱的信心和决心！它教育农民看到了自己的力量，不再在大自然面前畏缩、犹豫！它教育那些死记公式的水利工程技术人员，使他们知道兴修水利，应当依靠谁？
    现在，只是天水专区，就有十三条类似东梁渠的工程开工了。由武山县和甘谷县农民合开的北梁渠，长达一百公里，有一个山涧深一百二十公尺、宽一百公尺。整个工程，需要几百万个工日。农民没有向国家伸手要钱、要人。担任测量的仍是李华，引水过大山涧的还是林满绪，出钱出力的仍是农民自己。今年冬天，两个县要集中七万人，冒严寒施工。在甘肃省其他县里，也大都撒下了东梁渠的种子，三十多条大渠已经开工了！东梁渠，给山区水利化打出了一条道路。东梁渠的名字，将永远载在中国的水利史上，光辉永远不息！（附图片）
