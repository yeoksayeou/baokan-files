A Clever Scheme Gone Wrong
By a commentator of this newspaper

On December 6th, more than two months after the Soviet Union successfully launched its first artificial Earth satellite, the American rocket carrying a satellite only the size of a small football crashed and exploded a few feet after liftoff. The much-touted American "Vanguard" program for launching Earth satellites thus staged a ridiculous farce before the people of all countries.

The most powerful capitalist country, the United States, after long preparations, could not send a small sphere of only 1.5 kilograms into space; on the other hand, the Soviet Union, a socialist country, already had two giant artificial Earth satellites weighing 83.6 kilograms and 508.3 kilograms, respectively, soaring in space at altitudes of hundreds to over a thousand kilometers. What a stark and vivid contrast this is. Everyone can see from this fact that in the scientific and technological race between the Soviet Union and the United States, the United States has irretrievably lost. And the failure of the United States is far from limited to science and technology. The premature demise of the American satellite convincingly demonstrates the decay and backwardness of the capitalist system, and on the other hand, it makes people more convinced of the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system.

The capitalist world, especially the United States and other imperialist ruling groups, are extremely alarmed by this situation. The confidence of other countries in the North Atlantic group in the United States has long been shaken. The speeches made by US President Eisenhower one after another after the Soviet artificial satellite went into space, the continuous talks between the United States and Britain, and between the United States and other important member countries of the North Atlantic Group, fully revealed this uneasy mood. The United States has repeatedly expressed to its partners its intention to implement the principles of scientific "cooperation" and so-called "mutual dependence," but in reality, it is going all out to accelerate its arms expansion and war preparations, and wants to catch up with the Soviet Union in the development of weapons (missiles), in order to stabilize people's minds and tighten its control over its partners, so as to continue to promote its bankrupt policy of "strength." The United States has this purpose for the upcoming top-level meeting of the North Atlantic Group. Before the meeting was held, the United States tried every means to send anything into space, just to give the United States a little more prestige at the meeting. However, contrary to expectations, the little prestige that the United States had left in the North Atlantic countries was blown to pieces along with the "Vanguard" program. For the policies that the United States is preparing to promote at the upcoming top-level meeting of the North Atlantic Group, this is a premature dirge.

The United States may eventually send an artificial Earth satellite. But the farce that is currently being staged has completely bankrupted the myth that the United States has always boasted of being the most powerful and advanced country in the world. People of all countries will see from this fact once again that the power of the new world has definitely surpassed the old world.

    弄巧成拙

    12月6日，在苏联成功地发射了它的第一颗人造地球卫星的两个多月之后，美国运送一个只有小足球一样大小的卫星的火箭，在升空到几英尺的高度就坠地炸毁了。大肆吹嘘的美国发射地球卫星的所谓“先锋”计划，就这样在各国人民面前演出了一幕可笑的丑剧。
    最强大的资本主义国家美国，在经过长期准备之后，不能把一个只有一点五公斤的小球体送上天去；而另一方面，社会主义国家苏联的两颗重达八三点六公斤和五○八点三公斤的巨型人造地球卫星，却早已在数百公里以至一千多公里的高空遨游。这是一个多么鲜明的、生动的对比。每个人都可以从这个事实中看出，在苏联和美国之间所进行的一场科学技术的竞赛中，美国是无可挽回地输了。而美国的失败远不只限于科学技术方面。美国卫星的夭折令人信服地显示了资本主义制度的腐朽和落后，另一方面也使人更加确信社会主义制度的无比优越。
    资本主义世界，特别是美国及其他帝国主义统治集团对这种情况是万分惊慌的。北大西洋集团其他国家对美国的信心早就已经动摇了。美国总统艾森豪威尔在苏联人造卫星上天之后连续发表的演说，美英之间，以及美国同北大西洋集团其他重要成员国家之间不断举行的会谈，都充分流露了这种不安的心情。美国一再对它的伙伴们表示要实行什么科学“合作”和所谓“相互依赖”的原则，而实际上它全力以赴的是加速进行扩军备战，想在武器（导弹）的发展方面赶上苏联，借以安定人心和加紧对它的伙伴的控制，来继续推行它的破了产的“实力”政策。美国对于即将举行的北大西洋集团最高级会议，就是抱了这个目的。美国在这个会议举行之前，千方百计地想把无论什么东西送上天去，也正是为了要给美国在会议上多少增加一点威风。可是，事与愿违，美国在北大西洋国家中残存的一点威信，同那个“先锋号”计划一起被炸毁得精光了。对于美国在即将举行的北大西洋集团最高级会议上所准备推行的政策来说，这是一支预先奏出的送葬曲。
    美国也许终将会送出一个人造地球卫星的。但是目前所演出的这个丑剧，已使美国一向自己吹嘘的是世界上最强大和最先进的国家的神话完全破产了。各国人民将从这个事实中，再一次看到新世界的力量已确定无疑地超过了旧世界。
