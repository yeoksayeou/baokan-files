　　Develop Fire Protection Services and Strengthen the Fight Against Fires
　　Following the State Council's issuance of the "Instructions on Strengthening Fire Protection Work" on September 11th this year, the "Fire Supervision Regulations" were also promulgated on November 30th. This is of great significance for promoting the development of China's fire protection services and further strengthening the fight against fires.
　　Fire protection work is an extremely important measure to safeguard our country's socialist construction and the safety of the people's lives and property. Fire protection work in old China was extremely backward and corrupt. In the eight years since liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the construction of fire protection work has been actively carried out, and relying on the broad masses of the people, the struggle against fires has been effectively carried out. As a result, fires have been greatly reduced compared with before liberation, significantly changing the backward state of fire protection work in old China.
　　However, it should be noted that with the vigorous development of socialist construction in our country, the continuous growth and concentration of material wealth, and the gradual improvement of people's lives, the factors causing fires will inevitably increase with the increase in the use of fire and electricity in production and life. Under these circumstances, in order to more effectively organize the fight against fires, it is very necessary for the state to stipulate the organs, tasks, powers, organization, and systems of fire supervision in the form of laws and regulations, so that specialized agencies have a basis for their work, and the broad masses of the people also have something to follow.
　　It should be pointed out that the current fire situation is still serious. Fires continue to occur in cities, towns, industrial and mining enterprises, and rural areas. Some major fires in enterprises not only disrupt the production plans of one enterprise, but also often affect the production activities of many enterprises related to it. On November 14, 1956, the capital construction site of the Yongdeng Cement Plant in Gansu Province suffered a major loss due to a fire, which burned down the nearly completed factory buildings and the equipment that had already begun to be installed, thus making it impossible to realize the plan to support the Liujiaxia Reservoir and other construction projects in Gansu on schedule. However, some people still do not have a sufficient understanding of the seriousness of the harm caused by fires and the importance of fire protection work in safeguarding socialist economic construction and the safety of people's lives, and they have a rather serious sense of麻痹(má bì - paralysis, numbness, carelessness) and僥幸(jiǎo xìng - lucky, by chance). Therefore, fire protection work has not been well established in some areas and in some aspects. Some cities have not correspondingly planned fire protection work in the context of rapid industrial development, a significant increase in population, and the continuous expansion of building areas. Some enterprise management departments turn a blind eye to the dangerous situation of fires, lack necessary fire safety measures, and even when the fire supervision authorities put forward requirements for eliminating fire hazards, they still do not deal with them, resulting in serious fire losses. The expansion project construction site of the Datong Power Plant in Shanxi Province erected a large number of mat sheds during winter construction last year, and did not pay attention to fire safety. Although the local authorities made many suggestions, it was not improved. Later, a fire was caused by careless welding by workers, which not only burned down 7,500 square meters of new factory buildings and generators, but also affected the completion of the plant's production tasks. The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Supply and Marketing Cooperative warehouse stored a large number of explosive materials, which was very dangerous in terms of fire. Although the local public security organs repeatedly made suggestions to the cooperative to improve, they were not adopted. Finally, a fire occurred on June 1 this year, burning most of the stored materials, with a loss of 1.17 million yuan, and killing five residents. This is an act of dereliction of duty that shows indifference to the safety of state property and the lives of the people. Among the residents, due to a lack of fire prevention awareness and fire prevention knowledge, and a lack of attention to fire safety, fires often occur, causing significant losses.
　　In order to effectively prevent the occurrence of fires and safeguard socialist construction and the safety of the people's lives and property, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the Fire Supervision Regulations. People's Committees at all levels should, in accordance with the spirit of the "Instructions on Strengthening Fire Protection Work" issued by the State Council on September 11 and the requirements stipulated in the regulations, earnestly strengthen leadership over fire protection work, criticize and correct the erroneous ideas of turning a blind eye to the serious situation of fires and not caring about fire protection work, and should also make comprehensive plans for urban fire protection facilities in accordance with the development of urban construction and industrial construction.
　　The competent departments of the national economy must regard fire protection work as an important task to ensure the safety of production and construction, incorporate fire protection work into the production management plan, and strictly implement the system of responsibility for fire prevention at each level. The leaders of enterprises not only have the task of producing material wealth for the country, but also have the responsibility to protect the country's wealth from harm; they should take fire prevention measures in accordance with the fire hazard situation of their own enterprises and the characteristics of the production process, educate the broad masses of employees to consciously abide by the fire prevention system, and actively participate in fire prevention work.
　　Public security organs should earnestly undertake the task assigned by the state to implement fire supervision, further strengthen the organizational construction and business construction of fire protection work, strive to improve the technical level of fire protection personnel, widely and deeply carry out fire prevention publicity and education work, improve the fire prevention awareness of the broad masses of the people, popularize fire protection knowledge, and closely integrate the work of specialized fire protection agencies with the mobilization and organization of the masses for self-protection.
　　Actively participating in fire protection work is the duty of every state worker, worker, farmer, student, and citizen. Everyone should always maintain fire prevention awareness, consciously abide by and implement the fire prevention system, use fire and electricity safely in daily production and life, and supervise and inspect each other to effectively block loopholes in fire hazards. As long as everyone pays attention to fire prevention, everyone is vigilant about fires, and fire prevention work becomes a conscious action of every citizen, the harm of fires will surely be reduced or even prevented.

### 发展消防事业加强同火灾的斗争

　　发展消防事业加强同火灾的斗争
    继今年9月11日国务院发布了“关于加强消防工作的指示”以后，11月30日又公布了“消防监督条例”。这对于促进我国消防事业的发展，进一步加强同火灾作斗争，具有重大的意义。
    消防工作是保卫我国社会主义建设和人民生命财产安全的一项极为重要的措施。旧中国的消防工作是极端落后和腐败的。解放后的八年以来，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，积极地进行了消防工作的建设，组织和依靠广大人民群众，有效地开展了同火灾的斗争，因而火灾较解放以前大为减少，显著地改变了旧中国消防工作的落后面貌。
    但是应当看到，随着我国社会主义建设的蓬勃发展，物质财富的不断增长和集中，人民生活的逐步改善，生产、生活用火、用电的增多，火灾因素必然会日益增加。在这种情况下，为了更有效地组织同火灾的斗争，国家适时地把消防监督的机关、任务、权限、组织、制度等等，用法令的形式规定下来，使专门机关在工作中有所依据，广大的人民群众也有所遵循，是十分必要的。
    应当指出，当前的火灾情况还是严重的，不论在城市、集镇、工矿、企业和农村，火灾都还不断的发生。有些企业的重大火灾，不只是破坏了一个企业的生产计划，还常常影响了同它有关的许多企业的生产活动。1956年11月14日，甘肃永登水泥厂基建工程工地，就因为失火而造成重大损失，把即将落成的厂房和已经开始安装的设备全部烧光，因而使得支援刘家峡水库和甘肃其他建设工程的计划不能如期实现。但是还有些人，对于火灾危害的严重性及消防工作在保卫社会主义经济建设和人民生命安全的重要意义，认识不足，有相当严重的麻痹、侥幸思想。因此，消防工作在部分地区和有些方面尚未很好地建立起来。有的城市在工业迅速发展、人口显著增多、建筑面积随之不断扩大的情况下，没有相应地把消防工作加以规划。有些企业管理部门，对于火灾的危险情况熟视无睹，缺乏必要的消防安全措施，甚至当消防监督机关提出消除火灾危险措施的要求后，仍然不作处理，以致造成严重的火灾损失。山西大同发电厂扩建工地，在去年冬季施工中，大量搭建席棚，不注意防火安全，虽经当地机关多次建议，仍未改进，后因工人焊接不慎引起火灾，不但将七千五百平方公尺的新建厂房和发电机全部烧毁，而且影响到该厂生产任务的完成。新疆维吾尔自治区供销合作社仓库，存放了大量爆炸物品，火灾危险性很大，虽经当地公安机关多次向该社提出改进建议，但都没有采纳，终于今年6月1日发生火灾，将库存物资大部烧毁，损失一百一十七万元，并且烧死居民五人。这是对国家财产和人民生命的安全漠不关心的渎职行为。在居民群众中，由于缺乏防火警惕和防火知识，不注意防火安全，也常常发生火灾，造成重大损失。
    为了有效地制止火灾的发生，保卫社会主义建设和人民生命财产的安全，必须认真地贯彻实施消防监督条例。各级人民委员会，应当根据国务院9月11日发布的“关于加强消防工作的指示”的精神和条例中规定的要求，切实加强对消防工作的领导，批判和纠正对火灾的严重情况熟视无睹和不关心消防工作的错误思想，并且应当根据城市建设和工业建设的发展，将城市消防设施相应地加以全面规划。
    国民经济各主管部门，必须将消防工作作为保障生产建设安全的一项重要任务，把消防工作纳入生产管理计划之内，严格实行逐级防火负责制。企业的领导人员，不仅有为国家生产物质财富的任务，同时还有保卫国家财富不受危害的责任；应当根据本企业火灾危险情况和生产操作过程中的特点，采取防火措施，教育广大职工群众，自觉地遵守防火制度，积极参加防火工作。
    公安机关应当切实的担负起国家赋予的实施消防监督的任务，进一步加强消防工作的组织建设和业务建设，努力提高消防人员的技术水平，广泛深入地开展防火宣传教育工作，提高广大群众的防火警惕性，普及消防知识，使消防专门机关的工作和发动、组织群众自防密切结合起来。
    积极参加消防工作是每一个国家工作人员、工人、农民、学生、市民应尽的义务。每一个人都应当经常保持防火警惕性，自觉地遵守和执行防火制度，在日常的生产、生活中做到安全用火、用电，并且相互督促检查，切实地堵塞火灾危险漏洞。只要人人注意防火，个个警惕火灾，使防火工作成为每个公民的自觉的行动，火灾的危害就一定能够减少以至制止。
