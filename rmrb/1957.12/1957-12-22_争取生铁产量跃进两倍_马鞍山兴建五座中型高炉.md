Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, December 21st. Five medium-sized blast furnaces at the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant recently officially started construction.

These five medium-sized blast furnaces are designed to have a much larger production capacity than the existing six small blast furnaces at the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant.

After these five medium-sized blast furnaces are put into operation successively in 1959, Ma'anshan's annual pig iron production will be three times its current level.

    马鞍山兴建五座中型高炉
    新华社合肥21日电  马鞍山铁厂五座中型高炉最近正式动工兴建。
    这五座中型高炉的设计能力比马鞍山铁厂现有的六座小型高炉的生产能力大得多。
    这五座中型高炉到1959年陆续投入生产以后，马鞍山的生铁年产量将为现在的三倍。
