A Discussion

　　Dishonorable "Labor"
　　You Junwen, a cadre from an organization in Houma, Shanxi

　　In our organization, there is a leader who often has his family members go to the agricultural cooperative's fields to pick cotton as a "sideline" income. He even openly tells others that this is also a kind of "labor."

　　Originally, it was a custom in the countryside that after the cotton harvest, some cotton bolls and cotton petals left on the cotton plants could be picked up by the farmers. There is nothing wrong with this. Now that we have cooperatives, after the agricultural cooperative harvests the cotton fields, there will inevitably be some remnants. It should be up to the family members of the cooperative members to pick them up freely. On the one hand, this will ensure that this very small portion of labor results is not lost, and on the other hand, since these were originally the result of the cooperative members' labor, it is reasonable for the cooperative members' families to pick them up.

　　However, it is unreasonable for a person who does not participate in agricultural production to have his family members share the picking with the masses. This comrade even thinks that this is "labor," and uses this to defend his selfish behavior, which is even more absurd. If the effort spent taking other people's labor results is also called labor, then thieves can also call theft labor. Wouldn't this be a huge absurdity? A cadre should organize his family members to participate in agricultural or other labor nearby, and leaders of organizations should set an example. However, that should be real labor. This kind of taking small advantages and competing with farmers for profit has nothing to do with glorious labor.

### 不光荣的“劳动”

　　不光荣的“劳动”
　　山西侯马一机关干部　游俊文
    我们机关里有一个领导人，经常让自己的家属到农业社的田里去拾棉花，作为“副业”收入。并且还公开对别人说这也是一种“劳动”。
    本来农村里是有这种习惯的，棉花收获以后，有些遗在棉株上的棉桃和棉瓣，让农民拾走。这没有什么不好。现在合作化了，农业社收获后的棉田，也还不可免的有些遗物，应该由社员家中的人去自由拾拣，一方面使这极小部分劳动果实也不损失，另一方面，这些原就是社员们劳动的结果，由社员家中人拾走，也属合理。
    但是，一个并不参加农业生产的人，让自己的家属也同群众去分拾，就不合理了。这位同志居然还认为这是“劳动”，用这为自己的自私行为作辩护，这就更不像话了。如果把取走别人劳动果实所花的力气，也叫劳动的话，那末，偷窃者也可把偷窃行为叫作劳动了，这岂不是一个绝大的荒谬吗？一个干部应该组织自己的家属就近参加农业或其他的劳动，机关领导人更是应该以身作则，但是，那应该是真正的劳动。这种占小便宜、与农民争利的事，跟光荣的劳动是不相干的。
