Cultural Briefs

	An Innovation in Vocal Music Education
	With the help of Bulgarian vocal music expert Chirkin and Soviet expert Diliziyeva, the Vocal Music Department of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music has begun to establish opera and chamber music specialties. The opera class has now been established, and chamber music classes have also begun. The opening of these two specialties is an innovation in vocal music education in our country.
	The opera class will work closely with the Shanghai Experimental Opera House. It is now divided into two classes, A and B. Class A members are mainly teachers, and they will complete the five-year curriculum of a formal opera major within a year, and rehearse fragments of operas such as "Madame Butterfly," "The Abduction from the Seraglio," and "The Queen of Spades" based on their conditions. Based on the rehearsal of the opera fragments, they will then rehearse the entire opera. Class B members are selected from the third, fourth, and fifth-year students of the institute. They will systematically receive some basic opera training and observe the rehearsals of Class A. Expert Chirkin's wife and Zhang Tuo, director of the Shanghai Experimental Opera House, will teach the opera performance course for this class.
	The chamber music specialty is headed by Soviet expert Diliziyeva. He teaches according to the Stanislavsky system, training soloists, ensembles, chamber music teachers, and accompanists for our country through rigorous training.
	Dai Opera Performances are Active
	After the autumn harvest, nearly a hundred Dai amateur drama troupes in the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan Province began to travel to perform Dai opera in villages and towns.
	Performing Dai opera after the autumn harvest is an annual event for the Dai people since liberation. This year's scale is larger than in previous years, and many new plays have emerged. The Dai amateur drama troupe in Luxi County is now rehearsing two new Dai operas, "Ai Zuo Nong Slaying the Snake" and "Pamo Luan," based on beautiful folk tales.
	Dai opera has a history of more than sixty years and is a drama form loved by the Dai people. In recent years, the Communist Party and the People's Government have vigorously helped the Dai people develop their own drama, encouraged folk artists to create new scripts, and excavated and reorganized traditional plays that had been lost. For example, the love comedy "Thousand Petal Lotus," which is loved by the Dai people, has been reorganized and is back to meet the audience. In the process of reorganization, special attention has been paid to the inherent performance traditions, advocating the use of ethnic musical instruments for accompaniment and the unique dance techniques of the ethnic group to express the characters and plot of the play.
	Dochang High-Pitched Opera Revived
	Dochang County, Jiangxi Province, recently established a folk professional high-pitched opera troupe. This troupe brings together more than 20 veteran artists from Dochang and Hukou counties and has also absorbed some new students.
	The high-pitched opera of Dochang and Hukou is a branch of the famous "Qingyang Tune" of the Ming Dynasty, which retains the characteristics of "rolling tune." Before the late Qing Dynasty, high-pitched opera troupes in Dochang and Hukou, such as the "Xiulan Troupe," often performed in Zhizhi, Susong, and Taihu areas of Anhui. In 1939, the veteran artists of Dochang and Hukou still maintained the troupe organization of the "Xiulan Troupe" and performed on makeshift stages in the two counties. However, due to the persecution of the reactionary rulers, they finally had to disband and find other ways to make a living. Year after year, the veteran artists have lost their lives one after another, and this precious drama form is in danger of being lost and forgotten. After liberation, this drama form has been restored with the vigorous help of the Communist Party and the People's Government. More than 40 kinds of original and complete handwritten copies such as "The Story of the Pipa," "The Story of the White Rabbit," and "The Story of the Chain" have now been discovered.

	Qin腔 Opera "Fire Mane Horse" to be Made into Color Film
	The first Qin腔 opera color film "Fire Mane Horse" will begin shooting this month. The director and crew of Changchun Film Studio watched more than 40 full and excerpted plays in Xi'an and finally selected the famous playwright Li Shisan's posthumous work "Fire Mane Horse" as the blueprint for filming the Qin腔 opera film. This film will be directed by Comrade Zhang Xinshi. The "Shaanxi Qin腔 Opera Film Troupe," composed of famous Qin腔 opera actors Liu Yuzhong, Su Yumin, and others, has been rehearsing intensively in recent months and is expected to go to Changchun Film Studio for filming this month.

    声乐教育上的创举
    上海音乐学院声乐系在保加利亚声乐专家契尔金和苏联专家迪利济也娃的帮助下，开始分设歌剧专业和室内乐专业。现在歌剧班已经成立，室内乐也开始上课。这两个专业的开设，在我国声乐教育上是一个创举。
    歌剧班将和上海实验歌剧院密切合作，现分甲乙两班，甲班成员以教员为主，他们将在一年内突击学完正规歌剧专业要学习的五年的课程，并且根据条件排练“蝴蝶夫人”、“后宫的诱惑”、“黑桃皇后”等歌剧的片断，根据歌剧片断的排练情况再排练歌剧。乙班成员是在该院三、四、五年级同学中选拔出来的。他们将按部就班地接受歌剧的一些基本训练，并观摩甲班的排练。契尔金专家夫人和上海实验歌剧院导演张拓担任这一班的歌剧表演课程。
    室内乐专业由苏联专家迪利济也娃负责。他根据斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基体系进行教学，通过严格的训练，为我国培养独唱、重唱人材、室内乐教员和伴奏人材。
      傣戏演出活跃
    秋收结束了，云南德宏傣族景颇族自治州的近百个傣族业余戏剧队，开始出发去走乡串镇演出傣戏。
    秋收后演傣戏，是傣族人民在解放以来一年一度的盛事。今年规模更大过往年，出现了好些新剧目。潞西县傣族业余戏剧队现在就正在排演根据优美的民间传说编写的“艾左弄斩蛇”、“帕莫鸾”两出新傣戏。
    傣戏已有六十多年的历史，是傣族人民所喜爱的剧种。近几年来，共产党和人民政府大力帮助傣族人民发展自己的戏剧，鼓励民间艺人创作新剧本，发掘和整理已经失散的传统剧目。如为傣族人民所喜爱的恋爱喜剧“千瓣莲花”，就已经整理出来，又和观众见面了。在整理中，并且特别注意固有的演出传统，提倡以本民族的乐器伴奏和以本民族的特有的舞技来表现剧中的人物形象和故事情节。
    都昌高腔戏重生
    江西省都昌县最近成立了高腔戏民间职业剧团。这个剧团集中了都昌、湖口两县二十多位老艺人，并且吸收了一些新生。
    都昌、湖口的高腔，是著名的明代“青扬腔”的一个支派，它保持着“滚调”的特色。清代末年以前，都昌、湖口的高腔班社如“秀兰班”等，曾经常到安徽至德、宿松、太湖一带演出。1939年都昌、湖口的老艺人还保持着“秀兰班”的班社组织，在两县境内草台演出。但是由于反动统治者逼迫，终于不得不散伙另找生路。一年又一年，老艺人相继失去，这一名贵的剧种眼看要湮没失传。解放以后，这个剧种经过共产党和人民政府的大力帮助，才重新恢复起来。现在已经发现“琵琶记”、“白兔记”、“连环记”等四十多种正本、全部的传抄本。

    秦腔“火炎驹”将拍成彩色片
    第一部秦腔彩色影片“火炎驹”将在本月开拍。长春电影制片厂的导演和摄制组在西安观摩了四十多个本戏和折戏，最后选定名剧作家李十三的遗著“火炎驹”作为拍摄秦腔电影的蓝本。这部影片将由张辛实同志担任导演。由秦腔著名演员刘毓中、苏育民等组成的“陕西省秦腔电影剧团”，近月来正在紧张进行排练工作，估计在本月里可以去长春电影制片厂进行开拍。（李哲明）
