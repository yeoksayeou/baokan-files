    Leading Cadres Take the Lead, Broad Masses Actively Assist
    A Surge of Rectification Emerges in the Ministry of Railways

    (Our Dispatch) Beginning November 23rd, following a mass upsurge of airing views, a mass upsurge of rectification has emerged in the Ministry of Railways. As of the 27th, 14 units within the Ministry of Railways have processed (not including external transfers, same below) over 60% of the issues raised by the masses. Individual units, such as the Trade Union of the Ministry of Railways, the Bureau of Capital Construction, and the People's Railway Publishing House, have processed over 80%. On the 26th and 27th alone, ten units processed 20% to 40% of the issues. For example, the Passenger Bureau processed 36.7% in two days, the Education Bureau processed 37.5%, and the Rolling Stock Bureau processed 25.4%. A mass upsurge of rectification has emerged in the Ministry of Railways.

    Judging from the rectification process, although this stage mainly involves general rectification, it is generally well-rectified with very good results. For example, the Financial Accounting Bureau accepted the opinions of the employees and revised the "Measures for Remitting and Allocating Railway Transportation Revenue," which can save 10 million yuan in working capital. They also changed the revenue inspection methods, which can save 30% of the manpower of revenue inspectors. It is estimated that approximately 600 revenue inspectors can be reduced in operating railways. The Rolling Stock Bureau accepted the opinion of the Factory Management Bureau to no longer send the rarely used small-tonnage two-axle open wagons for major repairs at factories, but instead perform mid-life repairs at the sections, which can reduce the number of vehicles requiring factory repairs by 200 vehicles each year, saving more than 500,000 yuan. The Rolling Stock Bureau also accepted the suggestion of the Beijing Railway Administration to allocate passenger cars with single-layer windows and poor heating equipment, which are currently used in the north, to various bureaus in the south. In 1958, ten passenger cars would not need to be fitted with cold-proofing equipment, saving more than 20,000 yuan. In the past, the Ministry of Railways employees took free shuttle buses to and from work. During the airing of views, employees raised many opinions, suggesting that a fee be charged for taking shuttle buses. The General Office of the Ministry of Railways accepted this suggestion and, starting from January 1, 1958, a fee will be charged for taking shuttle buses. In the past, the Factory Management Bureau transferred three handymen from various factories every winter to tend the office stoves. Employees raised objections to this. After seeing this suggestion, the Factory Management Bureau immediately improved it. Now the employees tend the stoves themselves. After this change, the employees participate in simple physical labor and save three handymen. In the past, official documents reported by the General Office required the endorsement of the director of the General Office after being signed by the Minister and Vice Ministers, which often resulted in a backlog of documents that could not be issued in a timely manner. Now, a "Weekly Briefing System for Leaders to Endorse Official Documents" has been established, abolishing the General Office endorsement method. After this change, official documents are no longer backlogged. The Minister and Vice Ministers can also understand each other's endorsement of official documents and can also check the implementation of the decisions of the Minister's office meetings. The Director of the General Office can still understand the Ministry's document issuance situation. There are many such examples in this rectification upsurge in the Ministry of Railways. The broad masses of employees are satisfied with the leadership's vigorous efforts in carrying out rectification.

    The reason why the Ministry of Railways was able to form a mass upsurge of rectification in just a few days is mainly because the Party organization of the Ministry of Railways earnestly implemented the instructions of the Party Committee of Central Government Departments, strengthened leadership, and the cadres and masses of various units of the Ministry of Railways improved their understanding of rectification, and actively led and participated in rectification with revolutionary spirit and enthusiasm. Secondly, the past practice of a small number of people in the leading group and professional group studying rectification was changed. A combination of leadership and the masses was adopted, and the problems were classified in advance according to their nature, and then handed over to specialized groups or sections composed of the masses for discussion. The masses proposed improvement methods, and finally the leading group reviewed and announced them. This is not only rectified quickly but also rectified well. The leadership is proactive, and the masses are satisfied after rectification. Third, leading cadres personally took the lead, divided responsibilities, participated in various specialized groups or sections, and studied improvement methods with the masses. Fourth, problems were solved in the order of easy to difficult, changing the past phenomenon of indiscriminate, unplanned rectification, which would lead to delays when encountering difficult problems. Fifth, the Rectification Office of the Ministry of Railways also used wired broadcasting to promptly commend and criticize units that had rectified well and poorly, exchange information and experience, and encourage the rectification of various units.

    Currently, although the rectification work of the Ministry of Railways is progressing rapidly, the progress of various units is uneven. In the rectification process, some units have simple, crude, and irrelevant responses to the problems.

    The Party Group of the Ministry of Railways recently inspected the rectification situation of various units of the Ministry of Railways and instructed various units to not only be fast but also good in the rectification, and to ensure quality. It also required all units to have processed more than 80% of the opinions raised by the masses by the end of November.

    领导干部亲自动手　广大群众积极协助
    铁道部出现整改高潮
    本报讯　从11月23日起，在铁道部机关，继群众性的鸣放高潮之后，又出现了群众性的整改高潮。27日为止，铁道部机关已经有14个单位，处理（不包括外转、下同）的问题已达群众所提意见的60％以上。个别单位，如铁道部机关工会、基本建设局、人民铁道出版社，处理已达80％。仅26.27两日就有十个单位处理了20％到40％的问题，如旅客局两天内就处理了36.7％；教育局处理了37.5％；车辆局处理了25.4％。一个群众性的整改高潮已经在铁道部机关出现了。
    从整改中的情况来看，虽然这一阶段主要是一般性的整改，但一般来说是改得好的，效果也很好。如财务会计局接受职工提的意见，修改了“铁路运输收入上缴办法和拨款制度”，这一项就可节省流动资金一千万元；他们还改变了收入检查办法，这样改变以后可以节省收入检查人员的人力30％，估计，营业铁路就可以减少收入检查人员六百人左右。车辆局接受工厂管理局提出的意见，把现在很少使用的小吨位二轴敞车不再入厂大修，改为在段作中年修，每年可以减少需要入厂修理的车辆二百辆，可以节约五十余万元。车辆局又接受了北京局建议，把现在北方使用的单层窗户的客车和暖气装置较差的客车配给南方各局。1958年有十辆客车可以不再加装防寒装置，可以节约两万余元。铁道部职工上下班坐的交通车，过去是免费的，在鸣放中职工提了许多条意见，建议乘交通车收费，铁道部办公厅接受这一建议，从1958年1月1日起，乘交通车一律收费。工厂管理局过去每年冬季都从各工厂调来三个杂工来生办公室的火炉，职工对此提出了意见。工厂管理局看到了这条意见后，马上改进。现在火炉已改由职工自己动手生。这样改了以后，职工既参加了简单的体力劳动，又节省了三个杂工。办公厅过去上报的公文，在部长、副部长签字后，还要办公厅主任会章，往往积压公文不能及时发出。现在建立了“首长批发公文每周简报制度”，废除了办公厅会章的办法。这样改了后，公文不再积压了，部长、副部长之间批发公文的情况也可以互相了解，还可以检查部长办公会议决议的执行情况。办公厅主任仍然可以了解部的发文情况。像这样的例子，在铁道部这次整改高潮中是非常之多。广大职工对领导上这样大力进行整改都感满意。
    铁道部机关所以能在几天之内形成群众性的整改高潮，主要是铁道部党组织认真执行中央国家机关党委的指示，加强了领导，铁道部各个单位的干部与群众提高了对整改的认识，以革命的精神和热情积极地领导与参加整改。其次，改变了过去领导小组和专业小组少数人研究整改的作法，采取了领导与群众相结合的作法，把问题都事前按性质分类，然后交由群众组成的各专门小组或科室讨论，由群众提出改进的办法，最后由领导小组审核公布。这样既改的快，也改的好，领导主动，改了后群众也满意。第三，领导干部亲自动手，分工负责，参加各专门小组或科、室，和群众一起研究改进的办法。第四，按照先易后难的顺序解决问题，改变了过去不分难易、无计划地改，遇到困难问题就拖延时间的现象。第五，铁道部整风办公室还利用了有线广播，及时地表扬与批评整改好的与不好的单位，交流情况和经验，鼓励各单位的整改。
    目前，铁道部机关的整改工作虽然进展很快，但各单位的进度不平衡。有的单位在整改中对问题的处理有简单粗率和答非所问现象。
  　铁道部党组最近已检查了铁道部各单位的整改情况，并指示各单位在整改中不仅要快，还要好，要保证质量。并要求各单位在11月底，处理的数字都达到群众所提意见的80％以上。
