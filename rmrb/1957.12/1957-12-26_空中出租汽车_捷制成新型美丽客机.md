    “空中出租汽车”
    捷制成新型美丽客机
    新华社布拉格25日电　捷克斯洛伐克制造的一种“空中出租汽车”式飞机正在交通事业中成功地同汽车运输竞赛，这种“超级航空”型飞机运送乘客速度比汽车快，而票价并不贵于汽车。
    这种飞机小巧、美丽、舒适，它几乎可以在任何场所降落，例如草地、屋旁空场等。飞机的座舱除了一位飞行员外还可以容纳三位乘客和货物。飞机可以在热带以及寒带气候条件下飞行。这种飞机还可以安装无线电导航设备，以便在恶劣气候条件下飞行、黑夜飞行和穿过云层着陆。它的一般飞行速度是每小时二百四十公里，可以不着陆飞行一千六百公里。现在这种飞机已经向外国出口，有二十多个国家购买这种飞机。
