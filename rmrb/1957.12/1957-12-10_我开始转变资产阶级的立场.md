　　I Begin to Transform My Bourgeois Standpoint
　　Lu Yuwen

　　“Class struggle,” “working-class standpoint” – in the past few years, these terms were merely abstract concepts for me. Born into a landlord family, educated in the bourgeois style, and having served as an official in the reactionary Kuomintang regime for many years, I stood on the side of the reactionary ruling class for half my life. Consequently, I had many vague ideas about the concept of the “working class.” Since my surrender to the people in 1949, I have participated in the land reform movement, the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Movements, and the Suppression of Counter-Revolutionaries Movement. Each movement has educated and reformed me, but none as profoundly and intimately as this anti-Rightist struggle.

　　Gradually Clarifying the Significance of the Anti-Rightist Struggle

　　When I first spoke at the CPPCC National Committee symposium criticizing the statements of the rightists, I did not realize that I and the rightists stood on different political standpoints. I did not realize that the rightists' statements were made with ulterior motives. I did not have such a high level of political understanding. I simply felt that some people's statements did not conform to the facts, and were even distortions and slanders. I thought that this was not the correct attitude to help the Party rectify its work, unfair to the Communist Party, and detrimental to the cause of socialism. Therefore, I reminded everyone not to regard new socialist democratic things with old bourgeois democratic views, and to be vigilant against the idea of breaking away from the leadership of the Communist Party.

　　Under the Party's policy and call for "Let a hundred flowers bloom," everyone aired their views, and so did I. I absolutely did not want to hinder others from airing their views, and I absolutely did not expect that anyone would prevent me from airing my views. Why did Tan Tiwu fiercely scold me to my face for being "insincere"? Why did some people not sympathize with me, the person being scolded, but instead sympathize with Tan Tiwu, the person doing the scolding? I did not use a "class viewpoint" to look at the problem and was perplexed at the time and felt very confused.

　　The first anonymous letter enlightened me. Tan Tiwu, and those who sympathized with Tan Tiwu, were not opposing me personally, but opposing my support for the Communist Party. I support the Communist Party because I had taken a lifetime of detours, wrong paths, and even sinful paths, and finally found the correct path to take on the side of the Communist Party. Therefore, this anonymous letter did not achieve the purpose of intimidating me, but instead enlightened my awareness. When I spoke at the State Council symposium criticizing Chu Anping's fallacy of "the Party's world," I put forward a more clear and resolute proposition than my first speech. But even then, I still did not realize that this was class struggle.

　　Immediately afterward, the People's Daily editorial "What is the Reason?" was published. The broad masses of workers rose up to speak. The broad masses of peasants rose up to speak. Progressive intellectuals who were wholeheartedly following the Communist Party on the socialist road rose up to speak. "Those threats and insults only remind us that in our country, class struggle is still going on, and we must use the viewpoint of class struggle to observe the current phenomena and draw correct conclusions." These words in the People's Daily editorial made me realize that I had joined the anti-Rightist struggle. Later, I gradually understood that this struggle was a profound and sharp class struggle between the two lines of socialism and capitalism, with historical significance.

　　Enlightenment from Threatening Letters

　　When the broad masses of workers and peasants rose up to counterattack the bourgeois reactionaries, the rightists' rampant attacks in the sunlight subsided, but I received more anonymous letters from the shadows. Since the first anonymous letter was published, I received thirty anonymous letters in the three months of June, July, and August.

　　The content of these thirty anonymous letters was vicious cursing. Cursing my mother, cursing my ancestors, calling me "lacking integrity," "lacking personality," "an unadulterated slave," and so on. Cursing me was just an introduction; the main point was to curse the Communist Party. In addition to vicious cursing, there was also threatening. "Do not continue to be an accomplice, or you will bring evil upon yourself," "Your life is in danger," "How did the Hungarian incident happen?" "The Communist Party will perish in less than three years."… and so on. An anonymous letter postmarked in Shijiazhuang City told me after abuse and threats: "Please do not basely investigate the ink and paper of this letter, you will get nothing," indicating that the letter writer was a veteran agent. An anonymous letter from Guangxi, with the words "Good News" written on the envelope, told me after abuse and threats: he had been to many places, "Now is the era of Chen Sheng and Wu Guang… My name will appear soon."

　　I was cursed for "lacking integrity." Yes, I do not have the integrity of those who write anonymous letters to keep vigil for the reactionary Jiang Jieshi regime. I have the conviction to stick to the socialist road with the Communist Party, and abandoned the so-called integrity of "orphaned officials and illegitimate sons" of the reactionary class. I was cursed as "an unadulterated slave." Yes, I strive to be an intellectual who serves the workers and peasants, but the people who write anonymous letters are unadulterated slaves of Jiang Jieshi and Dulles, unadulterated slaves who cannot see the sunlight. From the language used by those who write anonymous letters to insult me, can't we clearly see their reactionary class standpoint?

　　These thirty anonymous letters, judging from the postmarks of the post office, came from sixteen large and medium-sized cities across the country. What do these thirty anonymous letters illustrate? It illustrates the absolute necessity and correctness of the Party's policy of suppressing counter-revolutionaries. It shows that there are still remaining counter-revolutionaries hidden within our people, and we need to continue to heighten our vigilance and wipe them out. It shows that the rampant attacks of the rightists against the Communist Party and socialism are connected with the underground activities of counter-revolutionaries hidden within the people. All the insults and threats against me enlightened me to recognize more problems.

　　The Education from Letters of Condolence

　　During the same period that I received thirty threatening letters, I also received seventy-one letters of condolence.

　　The content of these seventy-one letters was condolence, support, and encouragement. "If the intimidators really want to move a hair on your head, they will be crushed to pieces," "Although we don't know each other, our common ideals connect us," "Go forward bravely! Dear Comrade, there is always a young comrade supporting you." What particularly moved me was that the day after the news reported that I had received threatening letters, thirty-seven veteran workers from the state-owned Beijing Broadcasting Equipment Company sent three representatives with their jointly signed letter of condolence to the State Council to express their condolences to me in person.

　　Among these seventy-one letters, some came in the name of the entire trade union, school, or cooperative, some were jointly signed by several or even dozens of people, and some came in individual names. In terms of the region from which they came, they came from all provinces except Tibet. In terms of the composition of the senders, there were workers, peasants, teachers and students from universities and middle schools, cadres from government departments, ethnic minorities, political and legal workers, employees from supply and marketing cooperatives and department stores, and housewives.

　　What do these seventy-one letters of condolence illustrate? It shows that the Communist Party's belief among the 600 million working people across the country is supreme and cannot be shaken in the slightest. It shows that socialism has taken root in the hearts of the people in all regions, classes, and industries in China. If a small group of bourgeois rightists still delusionally attempts to restore capitalism, they are not only doomed to fail but will also inevitably be severely punished by the 600 million people. It also enlightened me that all the care and support for me is not out of love for me personally, but because I have changed my position and am willing to follow the Communist Party.

　　Education That Can Never Be Forgotten

　　Since then, I have noticed that the faces of the people I came into contact with have changed. Among friends who were usually quite good, some have become indifferent to me, and some even scold me behind my back. On the contrary, some people with whom I only had a nodding acquaintance have recently become extraordinarily affectionate when we meet. Some students, who originally deeply resented me for being an accomplice to the reactionary regime and have not interacted with me at all for twenty years, have now also written to greet me and have forgiven my past sins. I now need to learn to use a class viewpoint and class analysis methods to re-sort the people related to me, and re-divide who is a friend, who is not a friend, and who is an enemy according to the six criteria instructed by Chairman Mao.

　　This anti-Rightist struggle has educated me too profoundly. I will never forget the insults and threats from the rightists and the thirty anonymous letters. I will never forget the encouragement from the seventy-one letters of condolence. I will also never forget the changes in the warm and cold faces and friendly and hostile sentiments of the people I came into contact with. I believe that this anti-Rightist struggle has helped me abandon the bourgeois standpoint. I am determined to consolidate the profound education I have received, continue to transform myself, and always follow the Communist Party.

### 我开始转变资产阶级的立场

专栏：

　　我开始转变资产阶级的立场
　　卢郁文
    “阶级斗争”、“工人阶级立场”这些语汇，对我来说，在过去几年只是一些抽象的概念。自己是地主阶级出身，受的是资产阶级教育，做了多年国民党反动政权的官吏，半生站在反动统治阶级的立场，因而对“工人阶级”的概念，有很多模糊的思想。自从1949年我投降了人民之后，曾参加过土地改革运动，三反、五反运动、肃反运动。每一次运动都使我受到一次改造的教育；但是都赶不上这次反右斗争给我的教育深刻而切肤。
　　逐步明确反右派斗争的意义
    当我第一次在民革中央座谈会上发言批评右派分子的言论的时候，我没有意识到我和右派是站在不同的政治立场上。我没有意识到右派分子的发言是别有用心。我没有这样高的政治水平。我只是觉得有些人的发言不符合事实，甚至是歪曲和诬蔑。我认为这不是帮助党整风的正确态度，对于共产党不公平，对于社会主义的事业不利。因此，我提醒大家：不要以资产阶级民主主义的旧观点来看待社会主义民主的新事物；警惕着摆脱共产党的领导的想法。
    在党的“百家争鸣”的方针和号召之下，大家鸣，我也鸣。我绝对不想阻碍别人鸣，我也绝对没想到会有人不许我鸣。为什么谭惕吾恶狠狠地当面骂我“言不由衷”呢？为什么有些人不同情我这个被骂的人，反而同情谭惕吾那个骂人的人呢？我不会用“阶级观点”看问题，当时曾百思不得其解，很感困惑。
    第一封匿名信启发了我。谭惕吾也好，同情谭惕吾的人也好，他们不是反对我个人，而是反对我拥护共产党。我拥护共产党是由于我走了半生的弯路、错路甚至于罪恶之路，最后在共产党方面找到了应该走的正确道路。所以，这封匿名信没有达到恐吓我的目的，反而启发了我的觉悟。当我在国务院座谈会上发言批判储安平的“党天下”的谬论的时候，我提出了较第一次发言更为显明、坚决的主张。但这时，我仍然没有意识到这是阶级斗争。
    紧接着人民日报的社论“这是为什么”发表了。广大的工人群众起来讲话了。广大的农民群众起来讲话了。一心一意跟着共产党走社会主义道路的进步知识分子起来讲话了。“那些威胁和辱骂，只是提醒我们，在我们的国家里，阶级斗争还在进行着，我们还必须用阶级斗争的观点来观察当前的种种现象，并且得出正确的结论。”人民日报社论中的这些话，使我知道我已经投入了反右派斗争。以后又逐步明白了，这场斗争是具有历史意义的深刻而尖锐的社会主义和资本主义两条路线的阶级斗争。
    恐吓信给我的启发
    当广大的工人、农民起来向资产阶级反动派反击的时候，右派分子在阳光下的猖狂进攻敛迹了，可是我接到从阴暗处来的匿名信加多了，自从第一封匿名信被发表之后，我在6、7、8这三个月中间，接到了匿名信三十封。
    这三十封匿名信的内容，是咬牙切齿地辱骂。骂娘、骂祖宗、“没有气节”、“少了人格”、“不折不扣的奴才”、等等。骂我还只是个引言，主要是骂共产党。咬牙切齿的辱骂之外，就是张牙舞爪地恐吓。“不要继续为虎作伥，否则自寻其恶果”，“你的性命难保”，“匈波事件怎样发生的？”“共产党不满三年将自取灭亡。”……等等。一封盖着石家庄市邮戳的匿名信于辱骂恐吓之后告诉说：“请不要卑鄙地追究这封信的墨水、纸张，你们将什么也得不到”，说明这个写信的人是一个老牌特务。一封来自广西的匿名信，信封上写着“报喜”二字于辱骂恐吓之后告诉说：他已经走了好多地方，“现在已近陈胜吴广的时代……我的名字，不久就要出现了”。
    骂我“没有气节”。是的，我没有写匿名信的人那样为蒋介石反动政权守灵牌的气节；我有的是坚持跟着共产党走社会主义道路的信念，而抛弃了反动阶级“孤臣孽子”的所谓气节。骂我“不折不扣的奴才”。是的，我争取做一个为工农服务的知识分子，可是写匿名信的人是蒋介石杜勒斯一流的不折不扣的奴才，是见不得太阳光的不折不扣的奴才。从写匿名信的人对我的辱骂的用语，不是可以很清楚地看出他们的反动的阶级立场来吗？
    这三十封匿名信从邮政局的邮戳来看，是来自全国十六个大中城市的。这三十封匿名信说明什么呢？它说明了党的镇反肃反政策的绝对必要性和正确性。它说明了现在仍然有残余的反革命分子隐藏在我们人民内部，需要我们继续提高警惕，把他们肃清干净。它说明了右派分子的反共、反社会主义的猖狂进攻，是和隐藏在人民内部的反革命分子的地下活动连接在一起的。所有对我的辱骂和恐吓，启发我认识到更多的问题。
    慰问信给我的教育
    我在接到三十封恐吓信的同一期间内，也接到了七十一封慰问信。
    这七十一封信的内容是慰问，是支持，是鼓励。“如果恐吓者，真要动一动您的一根毫毛，他就要粉身碎骨”，“我们虽不相识，共同的理想把我们连在一起”，“勇于前进吧！亲爱的同志，随时都有一个青年同志在支持你”。特别使我感动的，报上公布我接到恐吓信的第二天，国营北京广播器材公司三十七位老工人就派了三个代表拿着他们联名的慰问信来国务院当面慰问我。
    这七十一封信中，有的是以工会、学校、合作社的全体名义来的，有的是几个人以至于几十个人联名来的，有的是以个人的名义来的。就来信的地区说，计除西藏地方而外，来自全国各省。就来信者的成份来说，有工人、农民、大中学校教员、学生、机关干部、少数民族、政法工作者、供销合作社和百货公司店员、家庭妇女。
    这七十一封慰问信说明什么呢？它说明了共产党在全国六亿劳动人民中间的信仰是至高无上的，是丝毫不能动摇的。它说明了社会主义在中国的各个地区、各个阶层、各个行业已深入人心，一小撮资产阶级右派分子如果还痴心妄想图谋资本主义的复辟，不但注定要失败也必然要遭到六亿人民的严厉的惩罚。它也启发了我，所有对我的关怀和支持不是对于我个人有所爱，而是由于我转变了立场，愿意跟着共产党走。
    永远不能忘记的教育
    从此之后，我发觉所接触的人们对我的面孔起了变化。平素相当要好的朋友中间，有的人对我冷淡起来，甚至也在背地里骂我。相反地，有些人和我平素仅仅是一面之识，点头之交，近来碰面倒格外亲热起来。有的学生，原来对于我为反动政权帮凶深感憎恶，二十年来压根和我没有来往，现在也来信问候我，原谅了我过去的罪恶。我现在需要学习用阶级观点和阶级的分析方法把和我有关系的人，重新排队，根据毛主席指示的六项标准重新划分一次谁是朋友，谁不是朋友，谁是敌人。
    这次反右斗争给我的教育太深刻了。我将永远忘不了右派分子和三十封匿名信对我的辱骂和恐吓。我更将永远忘不了七十一封慰问信对我的鼓励。我也将永远忘不了我所接触的人们对我冷暖面孔和友情敌意的变化。我相信这次反右斗争，帮助我弃绝了资产阶级立场。我决心巩固我所得到的深刻教育，继续改造自己，永远跟着共产党走。
