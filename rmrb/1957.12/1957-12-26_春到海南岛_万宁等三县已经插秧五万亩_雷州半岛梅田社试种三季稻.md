This newspaper's Guangzhou, December 25th dispatch reported by reporter Huang Xiangqing: While the fields of Northeast China are still covered with皑皑 white snow, the first spring plowing season of the Second Five-Year Plan has arrived in Hainan Island. On this beautiful and treasure-filled island, early rice sowing and seedling cultivation for next year have already begun comprehensively. Across the sea from Hainan Island, on the Leizhou Peninsula, the Meitian Agricultural Cooperative in Haikang County has also started transplanting rice seedlings earlier than ever before, in order to strive for three harvests a year.

After socialist education and inspired by the Agricultural Development Program, farmers on Hainan Island have a high enthusiasm for production, and after the winter's great production effort, a high tide of spring plowing and preparation has been set off. While accumulating manure and building water conservancy projects, agricultural cooperatives throughout the island have rationally arranged their labor force, and as early as the end of November, they successively began sowing and plowing. The spring sowing time in the southeastern coastal counties is generally ten days to half a month earlier than last year, striving for the timely greening of transplanted seedlings and avoiding frost damage. Up to now, Wanning, Qiongdong, and Lehui counties have transplanted rice seedlings in about 50,000 mu of rice paddies; the faster-progressing townships and cooperatives have completed 70 to 80 percent of the transplanting work.

Not only is the spring plowing and preparation work earlier than in previous years, but the quality has also significantly improved. Wanning and other counties inspected more than 40,000 mu of seedling fields, of which more than 80 percent implemented a series of advanced technical measures such as seed selection, disinfection, sparse sowing, and cultivation of strong seedlings, and more than 1,000 jin of base fertilizer was applied per mu.

The Meitian Agricultural Cooperative in Nanxing Township, Haikang County, Leizhou Peninsula, has exceeded the provisions of the Agricultural Development Program in this year's grain production. In order to strive to turn the barren beach 洋田 fields into three-season rice paddies within two or three years, the cooperative began spring plowing and transplanting seedlings as early as the 10th of this month. Meitian Cooperative is located in a barren beach 洋田 field area with no mountains, no trees, lack of water, and little rain. In the past, the cooperative's more than 1,800 mu of fields could only grow a single crop per year, yielding only about 120 jin of rice per mu. With the establishment and development of agricultural cooperatives, the members, after several years of hard work, have repaired water conservancy facilities and transformed all the single-crop bad fields into double-crop fertile fields, yielding 815 jin of rice per mu this year. For a greater harvest, the cooperative is determined to take advantage of the climatic conditions similar to Hainan Island and formulate a three-season plan. With the help of agricultural technicians over the past two years, they have conducted temperature measurements and seedling wintering experiments, and this year they began to implement the three-season plan on a portion of the paddy fields. The plan is as follows: transplant the first season of early rice seedlings in mid-December, striving to harvest after the Qingming Festival; then transplant middle rice seedlings, harvesting around the summer solstice; and transplant the third crop of late rice seedlings around the beginning of autumn. If the Meitian Cooperative realizes its three-season plan, the annual output of rice paddies per mu can be increased to 1,200 jin, and it will open up broad avenues for grain production increase in the Leizhou Peninsula.

    春到海南岛
    万宁等三县已经插秧五万亩
    雷州半岛梅田社试种三季稻
    本报广州25日电　记者黄向青报道：当祖国东北田野还被皑皑白雪复盖着的时候，第二个五年计划的头一个春耕季节来到了海南岛。在这个风光明媚的宝岛上，明年的早稻播种育秧工作已经全面展开。与海南岛隔海相对的雷州半岛上，为了争取一年三熟，海康县梅田农业社也空前地提早插秧了。
    经过社会主义教育并在农业发展纲要的鼓舞下，海南岛农民生产情绪高涨，紧接着冬季大生产之后，掀起了春耕备耕的高潮。在积肥和兴修水利的同时，全岛农业社合理安排了劳动力，早在11月底，就陆续开始播种、翻地。东南海岸各县春播的时间，普遍比去年提早了十天到半月，争取移植后的秧苗及时转青，避免冻害。到目前为止，万宁、琼东、乐会三县，已经约有五万亩稻田插下了秧苗；进展较快的乡社完成了插秧工作的百分之七、八十。
    春耕备耕工作不但比往年早，质量也显著提高了。万宁等县检查了四万多亩秧田，其中就有八成以上的秧田，贯彻实行了选种、消毒、疏播、育壮秧等一系列的先进技术措施，而且每亩田下足了底肥一千斤以上。
    雷州半岛海康县南兴乡梅田农业社，今年的产粮数量超过了农业发展纲要的规定。为了争取在两三年内把瘦瘠的海滩洋田变成一年三熟的稻田，这个社在本月10日就提早开始春耕插秧了。梅田社地处无山无树、缺水少雨的瘦瘠海滩洋田区。全社一千八百多亩田过去每年只能种单造，每亩只能收稻谷一百二十斤左右。随着农业社的建立和发展，社员们经过几年的艰苦努力，修好了水利，把全部单造坏田改造成为双造良田，今年每亩产稻谷八百一十五斤。为了更大的丰收，这个社又决心利用和海南岛相近的气候条件，制订了一年三熟的计划。两年来在农业技术人员的帮助下，进行了气温测定和秧苗过冬试验，今年开始在一部分水田上实施三熟计划。这个计划是：在12月中旬插第一季的早稻秧，争取清明后收获；跟着插中稻秧，在夏至前后收获；在立秋前后插下第三造的晚稻秧苗。如果梅田社实现一年三熟计划，每亩稻田的年产量就能提高到一千二百斤，并将为雷州半岛的粮食增产开辟宽广的途径。（附图片）
