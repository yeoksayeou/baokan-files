    The Jiaxing Iron Factory in Zhejiang, a locally state-owned enterprise, has recently successfully trial-produced a mud dredger. This mud dredger is designed based on the principle of axial flow pumps. It can dredge 20 tons of river mud per hour, with a working efficiency about 20 times higher than manual labor. (Gu Jie)
