　　Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd: Xinhua News Agency reporter Hai Lan reports: The late arrival and steady rise of the peak season for the supply of consumer goods after the autumn harvest, changing the usual pattern of an early arrival, is a major feature of the market this autumn. Looking at the sales of industrial products in the commercial department system, the total sales in October only increased by 1.76% compared to September. Although there was continued growth in November, it was not significant. It is expected that the commercial department system will normally complete the annual sales plan by the end of the year.

　　The changes in the distribution methods of agricultural producers' cooperatives, and the postponement of distribution times, are the decisive factors causing the market peak season to arrive late. In the past, farmers sold and bought as they harvested, and purchasing power poured into the market after the autumn harvest. Last year, because agricultural cooperatives pre-distributed earnings, the market entered a peak season in September. This year, agricultural cooperatives generally reduced the number of pre-distributions, concentrating the distribution at the time of final accounting, which was delayed compared to previous years. Taking the southern provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang, which harvest earlier, as examples, Fujian's last crop of rice was harvested in November and distributed in December in previous years, but this year it will be postponed to the beginning of next year. Agricultural cooperatives in Zhejiang Province distributed earnings at the end of October last year, but this year it will be delayed to November. After the bumper harvest, farmers in various places actively sold grain, cotton and other agricultural products to the state, and the amount of money the state put into purchasing agricultural products also greatly increased compared to previous years, but most of this money was deposited in banks. Since the autumn harvest, rural deposits have risen rapidly. By the end of October, the balance of rural deposits nationwide will reach twelve billion yuan, more than one and a half times higher than the same period last year. In the most recent month alone, more than 500 million yuan has been absorbed. In addition, during the socialist debate in the countryside, farmers were educated about borrowing and repaying debts and actively repaying agricultural loans when they were due. The situation of farmers repaying overdue loans in various places is better than in previous years. Up to the beginning of November, the People's Bank has recovered 41% of the overdue agricultural loans, reaching the planned recovery number for the second half of the year. Some cooperative members have some money in hand, but are also busy with water conservancy construction and accumulating fertilizer, and do not have time to go to the market.

　　In cities, due to the deepening of the education on building the country and managing households diligently and frugally, thrift has become a new social trend. The growth of industrial product sales in major cities is not high. Last year, the supply of industrial products was tighter in each successive quarter, but this year, since the second quarter, it has changed from tight to eased. Since the autumn harvest, the supply situation in urban markets has been normal.

　　In previous years, the post-autumn period was a slow season for the sale of means of production, but this year has broken this pattern. After the autumn harvest, large-scale winter agricultural production campaigns were launched throughout the country, and farmers' need for means of production greatly increased. Since October, the sales volume of hardware, transportation and electrical equipment, coal, cement, agricultural tools, fertilizers and other means of production in various markets has risen sharply. According to a survey conducted by the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in 19 key market towns in seven provinces including Jiangsu, Henan, and Sichuan, the sales of agricultural tools in October increased by more than 100% compared with September, while department stores and cultural goods only increased by 18% to 20%. The supply and marketing cooperative system in Henan Province sold 45.7% of the planned amount of means of production in the fourth quarter in October alone. A situation of short supply of means of production has generally emerged in various places.

　　The postponement of the peak season for the supply of consumer goods has provided good conditions for commercial departments to prepare for the supply of goods. At the same time, due to the postponement of the peak season, it is expected that purchasing power may be released more concentratedly, and the arrival of the off-season next year may also be postponed accordingly. Commercial departments in most areas have seen this feature and seized the current favorable opportunity to actively organize sources of goods. The reserves of daily-use industrial products are generally sufficient. However, some areas lack sufficient understanding of the characteristics of this year's peak season market, and there are varying degrees of relaxation or conservative thinking. Some are not active enough in organizing sources of goods and carrying out sales promotion, and some even compress inventories of industrial products, reducing the quantity and variety of goods. These practices are detrimental to production and supply. In some areas where the peak season is approaching, the supply of market goods has begun to become tight. In Yunnan Province, which entered the peak season in October, due to poor preparation of goods, the number of out-of-stock commodities in each special zone reached more than 100 for drugs alone. Some commercial units in Heilongjiang Province have not timely delivered peak season materials to the grassroots level. Currently, some rural markets are even out of stock of matches, soap, face cream, etc., which are in sufficient supply throughout the province. This should be noted and corrected.

### 今年市场旺季为什么来得迟？

　　今年市场旺季为什么来得迟？
    新华社2日讯　新华社记者海蓝报道：秋后生活资料供应的旺季姗姗来迟、稳步上升，改变历来旺季提早到来的规律，是今年秋后市场的一个主要特点。从商业部系统工业品的销售情况看，10月份销售总额只比9月份增长1.76％，11月份虽然续有增长，但不显著。预计到年底，商业部系统将正常地完成全年销售计划。
    农业生产合作社收益分配办法的改变，分配时间的推迟，是造成市场旺季来的迟的决定因素。过去农民随收、随卖、随买，秋收后购买力就陆续涌入市场；去年因农业社提前预分，9月间市场即进入旺季。今年农业社普遍减少了预分次数，比较集中地在决算时一次分配，决算时间都比往年推迟。以收获较早的福建、浙江等南方省份为例，福建往年最末一季稻在11月收割，12月分配，而今年要推迟到明年初才分配；浙江省农业社去年在10月底分配，今年要延至11月。各地农民在丰收后踊跃地把粮、棉等农作物卖给国家，国家投放收购农产品的货币也比往年大大增加，但这些钱大都存入银行里。秋收以来，农村存款迅速上升，到10月底，全国农村存款余额将达十二亿元，比去年同期增加一倍半以上，最近一个月来就吸储了五亿多元。再加上农村在展开社会主义大辩论的时候，对农民进行了有借有还、积极归还到期农业贷款的教育，各地农民归还到期贷款的情况比往年为好。到11月上旬止，人民银行收回的到期农业贷款已达到下半年计划收回数的41％。有些社员手头有点钱，也因为忙于兴修水利和积攒肥料，无暇上市。
    在城市里，由于勤俭建国、勤俭持家教育的深入人心，节约已成为社会新风尚。各大城市的工业品销售额增长都不多。去年工业品供应是一季比一季紧张，今年自第二季度以来就从紧张转向缓和，秋收以来，城市市场供应情况都很正常。
    往年秋后是生产资料销售的淡季，但是今年却打破了这个规律。秋收以后，全国农村紧接着开展了规模巨大的冬季农业生产运动，农民们对于生产资料的需要大大增加。自10月份以来，各地市场的五金、交通电工器材、煤炭、水泥、农具、肥料等生产资料的销售量成直线上升。据全国供销合作总社在江苏、河南、四川等七个省十九个重点集镇调查，10月份农具销售额比9月份增加一倍以上，而百货和文化用品却只增加18％到20％。河南省供销合作社系统10月份销售的生产资料就完成了第四季度计划的45.7％。各地已普遍呈现生产资料供不应求的现象。
    生活资料供应的旺季推迟，给商业部门做好物资供应的准备工作提供了良好条件。同时由于旺季推迟，预计购买力可能比较集中地投放，明年淡季到来的时间也可能随着推迟一些。大部分地区的商业部门已看到这一特点，抓住当前有利时机，积极组织货源，日用工业品的储备一般都很充足。但是也有一些地区由于对今年旺季市场的特点缺乏足够的认识，存在着不同程度的松劲情绪或保守思想。有的在组织货源、开展推销方面不够积极，有的甚至压缩工业品的库存，减少商品数量和品种，这些做法对生产对供应都是不利的。有些旺季来临的地区，市场物资供应开始出现紧张局面。云南省10月份转入旺季，由于物资准备不好，各专区脱销的商品仅药品一项就达百余种。黑龙江省有些商业单位没有及时把旺季物资下放到基层，目前有些农村市场上甚至连全省货源充足的火柴、肥皂、雪花膏等都脱销了。这是应当注意改正的。
