　　Grassland Lights
　　Gao Peisan
　　Guyang, this ancient mountain city, is getting younger and younger. Its beauty lies not only in its location, surrounded by mountains and rivers and embraced by verdant hills; not only in the vast and boundless grasslands and countless herds of cattle, sheep, and horses that surround it; not only in the brand-new and beautiful buildings that line its wide and clean streets... but also because this grassland town now has electric lights installed throughout the entire city.
　　Thick electric poles, bundles of wire, large and small boxes of light bulbs, switches, and fuse boxes, all pulled by rubber-wheeled carts. Street by street, lane by lane, door to door, from the new city in the south to the old city in the north, wherever the workers installed them, they were surrounded by enthusiastic crowds.
　　The residents on the old city side are mostly farmers. When the installation workers stepped into the old city, they became even more enthusiastic. Disregarding the cold wind and blowing sand at the top of the poles, they often worked through their breaks, even arriving early and leaving late each day, consciously extending their working hours.
　　The electric light in commune member Yin Futian's home was installed in the afternoon. In the evening, the old man returned from the yam field. Before the dinner table was even set, the light was on. The newly plastered white walls and the snow-white sheepskin rug on the kang were illuminated by the electric light, making the whole room brighter than daylight. Tonight, in this dazzling light, the old couple enjoyed their dinner, talking as they ate. The old man took a bite of his steamed bun, picked up a large mouthful of shrimp paste stewed tofu with his chopsticks, and, before he even swallowed it, began to reminisce about the past: how quickly things are changing! Just take the matter of lighting, not to mention the distant past, but since we can remember, until before liberation, how many families in our small place could afford to light kerosene lamps at night? Poor families didn't even use lamps, or if they did, they used sesame oil lamps for a short while. After liberation, everyone used kerosene lamps, and now we have electric lights. It's truly a step-by-step climb.
　　Grandma Yin, glancing at the electric light, added, "Humph! Have you forgotten how we used to use sesame oil lamps, and we were so poor that we didn't even have cotton to twist the wicks? Didn't we use scraps of paper instead?"
　　At this moment, the old man put down his thin porridge bowl, picked up his water pipe, slightly twisted his body, and faced the portrait of Chairman Mao hanging on the wall. He took a deep puff of smoke and said in a very emotional tone, "Our generation has had a really hard life. We must never forget the well-diggers when we drink water. We suffered under the landlord for most of our lives, enduring hunger and cold. We finally made it through that bitter sea. I herded cows for twelve years and wielded a hoe for twenty-five years. In those days, we poor people were considered worse than livestock in the eyes of the landlords.
　　I am fifty-five years old this year, and I have never been out of this area. I have never even seen what an electric light looks like. I never thought I would be using electric lights now. In those days, a poor wretch like me couldn't even dream of such luxury. That's why socialist construction is truly unmatched. Even our small town is developing so quickly. I don't know how well Beijing and Shanghai have been built."
　　Grandma Yin chimed in, "Socialism is so good, and yet some people say things to undermine it. Zhang Yunting says that joining the commune is not as good as the days when he had his own cart and ox. He also says that it was more convenient to run transportation and do petty trade before the spring and after the autumn, and he made more money. He also complains that after selling surplus grain now, he doesn't even have enough grain for himself."
　　When the old man heard this, he stroked his beard and said angrily, "Zhang Yunting is a well-to-do middle peasant. He can't see eye-to-eye with commune members like us. He says those things with ulterior motives. They can't stand the light of day. He's speaking those dark words with a dark heart. People like him, no matter how clever they pretend to be, are purely intoxicated with the capitalist ideology. Just wait and see. If people like him don't turn back quickly, they'll suffer in the end."
　　As the old couple were talking enthusiastically, they heard production team leader Zhao Qizi shouting outside the door, "Uncle Yin, have you finished eating? Tonight's debate will still be held at my place."
　　The old man quickly replied from inside the house, "Qizi, is the electric light installed in your house? Why don't we hold the debate at my place? The electric light is bright."
　　"The electric light in my house was installed this morning. Uncle, get off the kang and let's go," the production team leader shouted again.
　　"Okay, okay," the old man said as he got off the kang and put on his shoes. He walked out the door and saw a sea of lights before him, as if all the stars in the sky had fallen onto the grassland.

### 草原灯火

　　草原灯火
　　高佩三
    固阳，这座古老的山城，越来越年青了。它的美丽：不仅因为它依山傍水，翠岗环抱；不仅因为在它周围有着浩浩无垠的草原，数不尽的牛羊马群；不仅因为在它宽敞整洁的街道上，有着崭新漂亮的建筑群。……而且，如今这座草原城镇，全城都安上了电灯。
    粗大的电杆、一盘一捆的电线，大箱、小箱的灯泡、电门、闸盒，用胶轮车拉的满满的。一条街，一道巷，挨门挨户，由河南面的新城到河北面的旧城，工人们安装到哪里，就被哪里的热闹人群包围起来。
    旧城这边的居民，绝大部分是种地的农户。当安装工人们一跨进旧城时，他们就显得更加油了。他们不顾高杆上的寒风侵袭，土砂迷眼。他们常常忙得挤掉工间休息，甚至每天早到迟退，自觉地延长操作时间。
    社员尹福田家里的电灯，午后安好。傍晚老汉从山药地里回来，没等摆好饭桌，电灯就亮了。屋内才粉刷过的白墙面，炕上铺着的雪白羊毛毯，乍被电灯一照，整个屋子比白昼还亮堂。今晚在这耀眼的灯光下，老两口这顿晚餐，吃得高兴，边吃边说，老汉咬了一口馒头，用筷子夹起一大口虾酱炖豆腐，没等咽完，就追述起往事来：世道变化的多么快啊！就拿点灯这事来说，还不要说远年，从咱们记事，到解放以前，咱们这小地方，在那年头黑夜能点起煤油灯的才有几家？穷人家都不点灯，点一会也是麻油灯。解放后都点上煤油灯了，现在又安上电灯，这可真是步步登高。
    尹大娘两眼瞟着电灯，接过来补充了两句：“哼！你忘啦咱那时点麻油灯，穷的连捻灯芯的棉花都没有，不是用乱纸捻代替吗？”
    这时，老汉放下稀粥碗，端起水烟袋，略微一扭身子，对正了墙上挂着的毛主席像。深深地吸了一口烟，用他那十分感慨的声调说：“咱这一辈子人呵！生来真不容易。多昝吃水也不能忘了掏井的人。给地主受了多半辈子苦，挨饿受冻的苦海，总算熬过来了。放了十二年的牛，扛了二十五年的锄头。那年月咱穷人在地主眼里，简直都不如畜类。
    我今年五十五岁的人了，长这么大，没出过门，连电灯是啥样的都没见过。想不到现在咱也用上电灯了。要是在那年月像咱这样的穷棒子，做梦也梦不到这种阔气。要不说社会主义建设，真就是比不了。像咱们这小城镇，都建设得这么快，北京、上海那些大城市，也不知道建设得多好了。”
    尹大娘接过来说：“社会主义这么好，还有人说破坏话呢。人家张云亭说，入了社还不如从前自车自牛的日子好过。还说那时春前秋后的跑运输、作小买卖，赚钱多方便。还嚷现在卖余粮卖的，自己的粮食也不够吃。”
    老汉一听，捋了一把胡子，气呼呼地说：“张云亭是富裕中农，他跟咱们这样的社员，说不到一起。他说那些阴腔，那都见不得天。那都是黑着心说黑话。像他那样的人，别看混充精明，他纯粹是吃了资本主义的迷魂药了。往后看吧，他那样的人，不赶快回头，那还不是死吃亏。”
    老两口正在说得起劲的当儿，听见生产队长赵起子在门外喊叫：“尹二伯吃完饭了吗？今晚的辩论会，还在我那儿开。”
    老汉在屋里忙答腔：“起子，你家的电灯安好了吗？辩论会要不在我这儿开吧，电灯亮亮的。”
      “俺家的电灯，在今天前半晌就安好了，二伯下炕快走吧。”生产队长又喊了一遍。
      “好，好。”老汉边说边下炕穿鞋，走出门来，只见眼前一片灯火，好像满天星斗全落到草原上来了。
