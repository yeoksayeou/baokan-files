Large-Scale Water Conservancy Must Rely on the Masses

Rely on the state or rely on the masses? This is a question raised by many regions when discussing farmland water conservancy construction. Currently, in most parts of the country, this issue has been resolved, and a high tide of mass-based water conservancy construction has been formed. However, in some regions, this issue remains unresolved. Many people do not see the power of the masses. When the task of water conservancy construction comes down, they do not first mobilize the masses, but first find out from the higher authorities: how much money can the state provide? They plan to build more if the state provides more money, and less if the state provides less money. Some people directly propose: "To carry out large-scale water conservancy, the government must invest heavily." The current lack of enthusiasm for water conservancy construction in some areas and some agricultural cooperatives, and even the lack of any action, is largely related to this idea of solely relying on the state. Even in areas where the movement has already started, some cadres do not have a clear understanding of this issue.

Of course, some funds are needed to carry out water conservancy construction. The state has also fully considered the current needs of farmland water conservancy construction, and has increased the 1958 appropriations as much as possible, and has issued one-fifth to one-quarter of the total amount in advance. However, state appropriations can only be used as subsidies. The main part of the funds needed for current farmland water conservancy construction must be raised by the masses themselves. This is not only because the state's financial resources are limited, but also because farmland water conservancy, which is mainly composed of small-scale projects, is itself a mass-based construction undertaking. If it is not done by relying on the masses' own strength, it will be impossible to achieve the goal of being more, faster, better, and more economical. In the eight years since the liberation of Laibin County, Guangxi Province, the construction of farmland water conservancy has expanded the irrigated area by 255,000 mu, of which 130,000 mu were built during the high tide of water conservancy construction in 1956. If calculated according to the construction progress of the previous six years before 1956, the county would need another sixteen years to eliminate drought. Such a slow pace is extremely incompatible with the needs of national socialist construction and the masses' demands for developing production and improving their lives. Why was the progress so slow in the past? According to the analysis of relevant departments in Laibin County, in addition to the reason that cooperation had not been realized in the past, the main reason was that the cadres had the idea of relying on the state, believing that it would be impossible to eliminate drought without the state providing a large amount of money. Now, all the cadres in the county have realized the power of the masses from summing up the great achievements of water conservancy construction in 1956. Once they publicized and mobilized, a high tide of water conservancy construction was set off throughout the county. The water conservancy projects planned to be built throughout the county this winter and next spring can irrigate 530,000 mu of land. The masses in some districts have automatically raised a large amount of funds and materials, and want to eliminate drought within this year. The entire county can basically eliminate drought by 1960. In the Sanggan River irrigation area of Ying County, Shanxi Province, the second and third drainage canals were excavated. The second canal was invested by the state, and compensation was paid for the land occupied, and even money was paid for sand and stones, costing more than 110,000 yuan and subsidizing more than 30,000 catties of grain. It took two full years to complete a canal that was only twenty miles long, and the quality of the project was very poor. However, the situation was completely different for the third canal, which was built by relying on the masses and parallel to the second canal. The entire project only took twenty days, the quality was qualified, and as the canal was completed, the masses' canal maintenance plan was also formulated and implemented. The state only spent 13,000 yuan on subsidies for this canal.

Digging wells, opening canals, repairing ponds, and building dams are originally a component of agricultural production. Farmers have always regarded repairing water conservancy and planting land as their duty. It was only because of the limitations of social conditions in the past that farmers could not realize their desire to build water conservancy on a large scale, and had to endure the suffering of water and drought disasters for a long time. Now the social conditions have fundamentally changed, and the strength of the farmers has gathered from drops of water into rivers. In the past winter and spring, cadres and the masses in various places have also gained a lot of experience in carrying out large-scale water conservancy. As long as we are good at leadership, small-scale water conservancy projects and even some medium-sized water conservancy projects can be done by the masses themselves. Now, the peasants of Anhui Province have decided that small-scale water conservancy will not require any state funding at all, and they will increase and improve the irrigated area by more than 20 million mu this winter and next spring. In Wushan County, Gansu Province, the 113,000 mu of watered land built this year only required an average state subsidy of 1.7 cents per mu; among them, the 33,000 mu built in January did not require a single cent of state subsidy. Facts have repeatedly shown that small-scale water conservancy construction can rely on the masses, and must rely on the masses. State monopoly can only create the illusion among the masses that they are repairing water conservancy for the state, and the result is like Ying County repairing the second canal, which cost more money, more time, and the quality cannot be guaranteed. Moreover, there is so much farmland water conservancy that needs to be built throughout the country, how can the government afford to take care of it all, even if it wants to?

Some people do not see the strength of the masses, and always think that the production conditions in their areas are particularly poor and the people's lives are particularly difficult. If the state does not take more care of them, there will be no way to carry out water conservancy. Of course, in some mountainous areas, ethnic minority areas, old revolutionary base areas, and disaster areas, the difficulties in building water conservancy are greater, and the state should naturally give appropriate care to these areas first. However, even in these areas, the construction of small-scale water conservancy mainly relies on the manpower, financial resources, and materials of the masses. Although the conditions in these areas are poor, there is also a favorable side. The reason why these areas have been trapped in poverty for a long time, in addition to social reasons, is mostly because less water conservancy has been built, production cannot develop rapidly, and thus the masses' demand for water conservancy construction is even more urgent. Dong'an County, Hunan Province, is an area that has suffered from drought for many years. Last year, the drought-affected area in the county reached 78%, and production was reduced by 35%; this year, the drought-affected area in the county reached 63%, and production was reduced by 14%. Precisely because of this, as soon as the autumn harvest ended this year, 130 agricultural cooperatives in the county automatically wrote reports to the county leading organs, expressing their determination to eliminate drought. The Pingyi Agricultural Cooperative in Shizipu Township in this county suffered a 45% reduction in production due to drought this year, and the members decided to build a reservoir in winter that can irrigate 1,600 mu of land. In their application to the county leading organs, they said: "We don't want the government to give money, and we don't want the government to give grain. We only need the government to send a technician to guide us, and we can build the reservoir." The Zhumu Agricultural Cooperative in this county reduced production by 10% this year, and the members raised 1,200 yuan and sent a junior high school graduate carrying grain to the county water conservancy bureau to request temporary training in water conservancy technology; their reservoir has already started construction. Some cadres in Dong'an County originally thought that the masses were in economic difficulties and wanted the state to provide more subsidies, and the plan of the county water conservancy bureau was also relatively conservative, only preparing to build 55 reservoirs this winter and next spring; they did not expect that the masses not only did not want the state to give more money, but also that they wanted to build not 55 reservoirs but 85. According to the plan revised by the masses' discussion, this county can basically eliminate drought in only three years. The example of Dong'an County tells us that the determination and enthusiasm of the masses far exceed the expectations of those who are full of difficulties in their minds. The greater the disaster, the greater the determination and enthusiasm of the masses to eliminate the disaster. With determination and enthusiasm, there is a way to overcome difficulties. Miracles are often created in the most difficult areas or under the most difficult conditions.

Some people have not seriously studied the state's water conservancy construction policy, lack the spirit of seeking truth from facts, like to engage in large-scale projects, and look down on small-scale projects. And large-scale projects are technically strong and require a lot of money, which is difficult for the masses to organize themselves, so they have to rely on the state. Are large and medium-sized water conservancy projects good? Of course, they are very good. Since liberation, the state has invested heavily in controlling large rivers and rivers, and many medium-sized projects are also being held in various places. Precisely because large and medium-sized projects need to rely on state investment, they can only be planned uniformly by the central and local governments according to the necessary and possible conditions, and built with emphasis and steps. Moreover, according to China's natural conditions, mass-based small-scale water conservancy projects can never be replaced by a few large and medium-sized projects. For example, more wells need to be drilled in the northern plains; the terrain in mountainous areas is complex, and the forms of water conservancy projects should be diverse; the hilly areas in the south need to build reservoirs, but also need to dig ponds, build dams, and so on. How can relying solely on a few large and medium-sized projects solve all water conservancy problems? The characteristics of small-scale water conservancy projects are that they cost less and produce results quickly, and every township and every cooperative can build them. If 500 million peasants start building small-scale water conservancy at the same time, the effect will certainly be much faster and greater than concentrating on building a few large-scale water conservancy projects. The water conservancy department of Hengyang County, Hunan Province, originally had the idea of emphasizing large and neglecting small, and had planned to invest 80,000 yuan to concentrate on building two medium-sized reservoirs. When the county party committee reviewed the plan, it compared and calculated the benefits and investment of medium and small-sized reservoir projects, and revised the plan. The original plan to invest 80,000 yuan to build two medium-sized reservoirs could only irrigate 9,800 mu of land. According to the revised plan, the county only needs to invest more than 64,000 yuan to help the masses build 118 small reservoirs, irrigating more than 53,000 mu of land. The irrigated area has increased by more than four times compared with the original plan, but the investment has decreased by more than 15,000 yuan. It can be seen that the principle of mainly small-scale and supplemented by medium-scale is completely correct. Without adhering to and implementing this principle, there will be no mass-based water conservancy construction movement, and it will be impossible to eliminate ordinary water, drought, and flood disasters within a few years.

After a large-scale socialist education movement in the rural areas of the country, the socialist enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of the peasants have been greatly improved; the cooperative production in the past two years has also enhanced the material and financial resources of the peasants. We must boldly believe in the masses, closely rely on the masses, continue to enlighten and improve the consciousness of the masses, consolidate the determination and confidence to overcome disasters, and make the water conservancy construction movement develop more broadly, more realistically, and more sustainably.

### 大兴水利必须依靠群众

　　大兴水利必须依靠群众
    依靠国家还是依靠群众？这是不少地区在讨论农田水利建设的时候提出来的问题。目前，在全国大部分地区，这个问题已经解决，群众性的水利建设的高潮已经形成。但是，在一部分地区，这个问题仍然没有解决。有不少人看不见群众的力量。兴修水利的任务下来了，他们不是首先去发动群众，而是首先向上级摸底：究竟国家能拿出多少钱来？他们打算，国家多给钱就多修，少给钱就少修。有一些人更直接提出：“要大兴水利，非政府大量投资不可。”目前部分地区和一些农业社兴修水利劲头不足，甚至还没有动静，和这种单纯依靠国家的思想大有关系。就是运动已经开展起来的地区，部分干部对这个问题也还没有明确的认识。
    当然，进行水利建设没有一定的资金是不行的。国家也充分考虑了当前农田水利建设的需要，尽可能地增加了1958年的拨款，并且将总数的五分之一到四分之一提前发放了。但是，国家的拨款只能作为补助。当前农田水利建设所需资金的主要部分，必须依靠群众自己筹集。这不仅是因为国家的财力有限，而且因为以小型工程为主的农田水利，它本身就是一种群众性的建设事业，如果不依靠群众自己的力量来办，就不可能达到又多又快又好又省的目的。广西省来宾县解放后八年以来，兴修农田水利共扩大灌溉面积二十五万五千亩，其中十三万亩是在1956年的水利建设高潮中兴修的。如果按照1956年以前六年的建设进度推算，全县还需要十六年才能消灭干旱。这样缓慢的进度，是同国家社会主义建设的需要和群众发展生产、改善生活的要求极不相称的。过去的进度为什么如此缓慢呢？据来宾县有关部门的分析，除了过去没有实现合作化的原因以外，主要是干部有依赖国家的思想，认为国家不大量出钱，就不能消灭旱灾。现在，全县干部从总结1956年水利建设的巨大成绩中，认识了群众的力量。一经他们宣传动员，全县的水利建设高潮就掀起来了。全县计划今冬明春兴修的水利工程可以灌田五十三万亩。有些区的群众自动筹集了大批资金和物料，要在今年以内消灭干旱。全县到1960年就可以基本消灭旱灾。山西省应县桑干河灌溉区开挖了第二、第三两条排水干渠。其中第二干渠由国家投资，占地出赔偿费，连沙土石头也出钱买，共花费十一万多元，补助粮食三万多斤，一条不过二十里长的渠道整整费了两年时间才完成，工程质量还很差。但是，同第二干渠并列的第三干渠，是依靠群众兴修的，情形就完全不同了。全部工程只需二十天的时间，质量合格，而且随着渠道的完工，群众的渠道养护计划也制定出来付诸实施了。而国家对这条渠只花了一万三千元补助费。
    打井、开渠、修塘、筑坝本来是农业生产的一个组成部分。修水利，种田地，从来农民都看作自己的本分。只是过去由于社会条件的限制，农民才无法实现广修水利的愿望，不得不长期忍受水旱灾害的苦难。现在社会条件根本改变了，农民的力量由滴水汇成江河。在前冬去春，各地干部和群众也取得了不少大兴水利的经验。只要我们善于领导，小型水利工程以至某些中型水利工程，是群众自己办得到的。现在，安徽省的农民，已经决定小型水利完全不要国家出钱，今冬明春要增加和改善灌溉面积二千多万亩。甘肃省武山县今年兴修的十一万三千多亩水地，平均每亩只要国家补助一角七分钱；其中1月份兴修的三万三千多亩，没有要国家补助一分钱。事实一再说明，小型水利建设可以依靠群众，也必须依靠群众。国家包办，只能使群众产生这样的错觉：似乎他们在为国家修水利，结果就像应县修第二干渠那样，多花了钱，多费了时间，质量还不能保证。而且，全国需要兴修的农田水利是那样多，政府就是想包办，又怎能包办得起呢？
    有些人看不见群众的力量，总以为自己的地区生产条件特别差，人民生活特别困难，国家如果不多多照顾，兴修水利就没有办法。当然，像某些山区、少数民族地区、老根据地和灾区，兴修水利的困难是要大一些，国家对于这些地区，自然要首先予以适当的照顾。但是，就是这些地区，兴修小型水利主要也是要依靠群众的人力、财力、物力。这些地区条件固然较差，但也有有利的一面。这些地区之所以长期陷于贫困，除了社会原因以外，多半由于水利兴办得少，生产不能迅速发展，因而群众对兴修水利的要求也更为迫切。湖南省东安县是个连年遭受旱灾的地区，去年全县受旱面积达78％，减产35％；今年全县受旱面积又达63％，减产14％。正因为这样，今年秋收刚结束，全县就有一百三十个农业社自动写报告给县领导机关，表示决心消灭干旱。这个县的狮子铺乡平一农业社今年受旱减产45％，社员们决心在冬天修建一座能灌田一千六百亩的水库。他们写给县领导机关的申请书上说：“一不要政府拿钱，二不要政府拿粮，只要政府派一个技术人员来指导一下，我们就可以把水库修起来。”这个县的竹木农业社今年减产10％，社员自筹了一千二百元资金，并且派了一个初中毕业生背着粮食到县水利局要求临时学习修水利技术；他们的水库早已开工。东安县的一些干部原来认为群众经济困难，想要国家多给补助，县水利局的计划也比较保守，只准备今冬明春修水库五十五个；没想到群众不仅不要国家多出钱，而且他们要修的水库不是五十五个而是八十五个。按照群众讨论修订过的计划，这个县只要三年时间，就可以基本消灭旱灾。东安县的例子告诉我们，群众的决心和劲头远远超过那些脑子里满是困难的人的意料。灾害大，群众消灭灾害的决心和劲头更大。有决心，有劲头，就有办法克服困难。奇迹，往往是在最困难的地区或者在最困难的条件下创造出来的。
    有些人对国家的水利建设方针没有认真研究，又缺乏实事求是的精神，喜欢搞大型工程，看不起小型工程。而大型工程技术性强，需钱多，群众自己难于举办，只好依靠国家。大、中型水利工程好不好呢？当然很好。解放以来国家大量投资治理大江大河，许多中型工程各地也都在举办。正因为大、中型工程需要靠国家投资，所以只能由中央和地方根据必要和可能的条件，统一筹划，有重点有步骤地兴修。而且，根据我国的自然条件，群众性的小型水利工程，决不是少数大、中型工程可以代替得了的。比如，北方平原地带需要多打井；山区地形复杂，水利工程的形式就应该多种多样；南方的丘陵地带需要修水库，也需要挖塘、筑坝，等等。光靠少数的大、中型工程，怎么能解决全部水利问题？小型水利工程的特点是花钱少、收效快，每乡、每社都可以兴修。五亿农民同时动手兴修小型水利，其效果当然比集中兴修的少数大型水利工程快得多，大得多。湖南衡阳县水利部门原来有重大轻小的思想，曾计划投资八万元，集中兴建两座中型水库。县委审查计划的时候，将中、小型水库工程效益和投资作了对比核算，修改了这个计划。原计划投资八万元兴建的两座中型水库只能灌田九千八百亩。修改后的计划全县只需投资六万四千多元，便可以帮助群众兴修一百一十八座小型水库，灌田五万三千多亩。灌溉面积比原计划增加四倍多，投资却减少了一万五千多元。由此可见，小型为主、中型为辅的方针是完全正确的。不坚持贯彻这个方针，就没有群众性的水利建设运动，也就不可能在几年之内消灭普通水、旱、涝灾害。
    全国农村经过大规模的社会主义教育运动，农民的社会主义积极性和生产劲头大大提高了；两年来的合作生产，也增强了农民的物力财力。我们要大胆地相信群众，紧紧地依靠群众，继续启发和提高群众的觉悟，巩固战胜灾害的决心和信心，使水利建设运动更广阔、更踏实、更持久地发展下去。
