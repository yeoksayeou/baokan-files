    Diligently and Thriftily Manage the Household
    Zhu De
    The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao recently put forward the slogan "Diligently and thriftily manage the household" as an important supplement to the principle of "Diligently and thriftily build the country." This call is based on China's actual situation, and it has great significance for every family and the construction of our entire country.
    Our country is a country with vast land, abundant resources, and a large population, but it is also an economically and technologically backward country with a low standard of living for the people. In order to change this backward state of our country, in the past few years, the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Party, have made great efforts, enabling the cause of production and construction to achieve tremendous development. But generally speaking, our country is still backward and poor. To build a prosperous and strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture in ten to fifteen years on this basis, and to strive to catch up with and surpass the United Kingdom in terms of the output level of major industrial products, this is not an easy task. We must rely on the concerted efforts of more than 600 million people in China, give full play to all positive factors, and conscientiously implement the principle of "building the country diligently and thriftily, and managing the household diligently and thriftily" in order to achieve this great goal.
    The Chinese people have always been diligent and thrifty. The fine tradition of "seeking enough to eat and enough to wear" has been maintained for thousands of years. In the past few decades of revolutionary war, the vast number of cadres and troops led by our Party inherited and carried forward this glorious tradition. Living a simple life and sharing weal and woe with the masses has become a virtue pursued by every revolutionary. Precisely because of this, our Party and the vast number of people under the leadership of our Party were able to overcome various difficulties and finally defeat the enemy in the severe situation of being surrounded and attacked by the enemy. After we entered the city from the countryside, on the one hand, we greatly changed the extravagant atmosphere left over by the old bourgeois cities; but on the other hand, with the initial improvement of life in a peaceful construction environment, and due to the influence of bourgeois reactionary ideas and decadent lifestyles, a kind of extravagant and wasteful atmosphere has grown among some people, pursuing gorgeous clothing and food, demanding luxury in housing, and paying attention to ostentation in weddings, funerals, and social interactions, thinking that this is enough to gain "face." It should be admitted that this is a bad trend. This bad trend was criticized in the "Three-Anti" movement launched in 1952, and it was overcome to a certain extent. But in the past few years, this trend has developed somewhat. We must thoroughly correct it.
    The laboring masses who lived in the old society and the revolutionary cadres who have been tempered through struggle are easy to accept the call for hard work and thrifty housekeeping, because they have suffered hardships in the old era, and comparing today's life with the past, they know that today's life has been greatly improved. The broad masses of young people also understand that the beautiful future of the motherland and the happy life of the people can only be created through hard work. They are vigorously working hard for the construction of the new society. But for some young people, especially some young people who have been influenced by bourgeois ideas, they neither know the hardships of the past nor can they compare today's happiness. They even say: "You lived in the old era and should suffer; we live in the new society and should enjoy happiness." As a result, some people are preoccupied with the level of wages and benefits, and only consider their own narrow interests, while ignoring the major fact that our country has just begun to build socialism, that there are still many difficulties in construction, and that the improvement of life can only be gradually improved with the development of production. This is the most dangerous phenomenon. I hope that our young generation will resolutely overcome individualism, establish collectivism, and devote themselves to the great struggle of socialist construction with exemplary practical actions. For some minors and children who have not yet reached adulthood, we should also strengthen the education of diligence and thrift, especially for some minors and children whose families are relatively wealthy, this aspect of education is even more urgently needed.
    Diligently managing the household includes two aspects: diligence and thrift. "Diligence" means increasing production in many ways. All family members who have a little time must be allowed to participate in certain labor, such as participating in agricultural production if they are older, and engaging in sideline production, raising livestock and poultry, and necessary housework if they are younger. "Thrift" means saving in many ways. In terms of clothing, food, housing, transportation, and daily use, whether it is cash or materials, if it can be saved, try to save it as much as possible; if it can be spent less, try to spend less; the saved cash and materials should be saved. Over time, this is a large amount. As the saying goes, "Save a handful a day, and you can buy a horse in ten years." In this way, not only can we solve the temporary expenses of our own family's weddings, funerals, and medical care, but also accumulate funds for national construction. In short, when implementing the policy of diligently and thriftily managing the household, we should mainly work hard in three aspects: diligent production, practicing strict economy, and planning household expenses in a planned way. Everyone is responsible for diligently managing the household, and women, as the hosts of household affairs, bear greater responsibility in this regard. If every woman can diligently and thriftily manage the household, she can make a significant contribution to the socialist construction of the motherland.
    After the individual economy was transformed into a collective economy, due to insufficient publicity and education, many people often have a kind of illusion, thinking that since we have entered socialism now, all difficulties can be solved by the state and the collective. They say: "Production listens to the gong, and eating and clothing depend on the chairman of the commune." This idea is wrong. Socialism implements the principle of "those who do not work shall not eat" and "distribution according to work," not some kind of "eating from the big pot." We should create an atmosphere of advocating thrift among the people of the whole country, strive for simplicity and thrift in daily life, all weddings and funerals, and social interactions, and at the same time advocate accumulating grain to prevent famine, accumulating money for emergencies, advocating mutual assistance, and carrying forward the virtue of "helping neighbors" of the working people of our country. These are of great significance to the interests of individuals, families, and the country.
    Our country has 600 million people, each of whom has a family, and each person bears an unshirkable glorious responsibility of raising the old and the young in the family. However, some extreme individualists regard the glorious task of raising the old and the young as an extra burden, and improperly push this responsibility to the public and the collective, which is completely wrong. From the perspective of Marxists, socialism and communism are not about abolishing the family, but about making the family happier and more fulfilling. The ancient precepts of raising parents and educating children are not only applicable now, but will also be applicable in the future.
    In order to build socialism, we still have to make more than ten years of arduous efforts. But as long as our 600 million people and more than 100 million families in the country are aware and unite, and implement the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily and managing the household diligently and thriftily, then all the difficulties in our construction and life can be overcome. The current China, which is still relatively backward and relatively poor, will surely become an advanced, prosperous, socialist and communist China!

    勤俭持家
    朱德
    中国共产党中央和毛主席，最近提出了勤俭持家的口号，作为勤俭建国这个方针的重要补充。这个号召，是根据我国实际情况提出来的，它对每个家庭和我们整个国家的建设，都有重大的意义。
    我国是一个地大物博、人口众多的国家，但也是一个经济技术落后、人民生活水平很低的国家。为了改变我国这种落后状态，几年来，全国人民在党的领导下，作了极大的努力，使生产和建设事业获得了巨大的发展。但是总的说来，我们的国家还是落后和贫穷的。要想在这样的基础上在十年到十五年内建成一个有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的富强的社会主义国家，并且争取在主要工业产品的产量水平方面赶上和超过英国，这不是一件轻而易举的事情。必须依靠全中国六亿多人的一致努力，发挥一切积极因素，切实贯彻执行“勤俭建国、勤俭持家”的方针，才能达到这个伟大的目的。
    我国人民向来是勤劳节俭的，“食求果腹，衣求蔽体”的优良传统，一直保持了几千年。在过去几十年的革命战争时期，我们党所领导的广大干部和军队，继承并发扬了这一光荣传统。生活俭朴，与群众同甘共苦，成为每个革命者所追求的美德。正因为如此，我党以及我党领导下的广大人民，能够在敌人重重包围和进攻的严重情况下，克服各种困难，终于战胜了敌人。在我们由乡村进入城市以后，一方面大大地改变了旧的资产阶级的城市所遗留下来的奢侈风气；但是另一方面，随着在和平建设环境中生活有了初步的改善，并由于资产阶级的反动思想和腐朽的生活方式的影响，在某些人中间，又滋长起一种奢侈浪费的风气，衣食追求华美，居住要求阔气，在婚丧嫁娶、送往迎来等方面讲究排场，以为这样才够“面子”。应该承认，这是一种不良的风气。这种不良风气，在1952年展开的“三反”运动中，曾经受到过批判，得到了一定程度的克服。但是这几年来，这种风气又有所发展。我们要彻底地把它纠正过来。
    在旧社会生活过的劳苦群众和经过斗争锻炼的革命干部，对于艰苦奋斗和勤俭持家的号召，是容易接受的，因为他们在旧时代受过艰难困苦，拿今天的生活同过去的生活相比较，他们就知道今天的生活是大大地改善了。广大的青年群众也都懂得，祖国的美好将来和人民幸福的生活，只能靠艰苦的劳动来创造，他们生气勃勃地为新社会的建设而努力劳动。但是对于一些青年特别是对一些受了资产阶级思想影响的青年说来，他们既不知道过去的艰苦，也就比不出今天的幸福。他们甚至说：“你们是生活在旧时代，应该受苦；我们是生活在新社会，应该享福。”于是有些人就斤斤计较工资待遇的高低，专门考虑个人的狭隘的利益，而对于我们国家还在刚刚开始建设社会主义，建设中还有许许多多的困难以及生活的改善只能随着生产的发展来逐步提高等重大的事情，反而置诸脑后了。这是一种最危险的现象。希望我们青年一代，坚决克服个人主义，树立集体主义，并以模范的实际行动，投身到社会主义建设的伟大斗争中去。对于一些尚未成年的少年儿童，也应该加强勤俭教育，特别是一些家庭生活比较富裕的少年儿童，这方面的教育更为迫切需要。
    勤俭持家包括勤和俭两个方面。“勤”就是要多方面增产。凡家庭成员中稍有时间的就必须让他们参加一定的劳动，大的如参加农业生产，小的如搞副业生产、饲养家畜家禽以及必要的家务劳动等。“俭”就是要多方面节约。在衣、食、住、行以及日用等方面，无论是现金和物资，凡是可以不花的，就尽量不花；凡是可以少花的，就尽量少花；节省下来的现金和物资，都应当储蓄起来。这样日积月累，就是一个很大的数目。俗话说得好：“一天省一把，十年买匹马。”这样，不仅可以解决自己家庭红白喜事、医药卫生等临时开支的需要，还可以为国家积累建设的资金。总之，在贯彻执行勤俭持家方针的时候，主要应当从勤劳生产、厉行节约和有计划地安排家务开支等三方面来努力。勤俭持家，人人有责，妇女是家务的主持者，在这方面负有更大的责任。如果每个妇女都能勤俭持家，就可以对祖国的社会主义建设事业作出重大的贡献。
    在由个体经济变为集体经济后，由于我们宣传教育不够，不少人往往产生了一种错觉，以为现在既然进入社会主义了，一切困难都可以靠国家和集体来解决。他们说：“生产听锣响，吃穿找社长。”这种想法是错误的。社会主义实行的是“不劳动者不得食”和“按劳取酬”的原则，并不是什么“吃大锅饭”。我们应该在全国人民中造成一种崇尚节俭的风气，日常生活、一切婚丧嫁娶和人情往来都要力求简朴和节约，同时提倡积粮防荒、积钱备用，提倡互助互济，发扬我国劳动人民的“乡邻相帮”的美德。这些对于个人、家庭和国家的利益，都有重大的意义。
    我们的国家有六万万人，每个人都有一个家庭，每个人在家庭中都负有一种不可推辞的光荣的养老养小的责任。可是有些极端的个人主义者，把养老养小的光荣任务，看成是一个额外负担，不正当地把这个责任推给公家和集体，这是完全错误的。在马克思主义者看来，社会主义和共产主义并不是要取消家庭，而是要使家庭更幸福更美满。养亲教子的古训，不仅现在适用，就是将来也是适用的。
    为了建成社会主义，我们还要做十几年的艰苦努力。但是只要我们全国六亿多人和一亿多个家庭都觉悟和团结起来，实行勤俭建国和勤俭持家，那么，我们建设和生活中的一切困难都是可以克服的。目前仍然是比较落后和比较贫穷的中国，一定能变为先进的富强的社会主义和共产主义的中国！
