Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 17th. The special committee of the Indonesian Parliament, established to study the cooperation between President Sukarno and former Vice President Hatta, reported to the Parliament on the evening of the 16th that Hatta had expressed his unwillingness to resume the vice presidency or to concurrently serve as chairman of the National Planning Council.

Arim, chairman of the special committee, in reporting the results of three meetings held with Sukarno, Hatta, and government representatives over the past two weeks, said that Hatta stated in the meetings that resuming the vice presidency was not the only form of cooperation between him and President Sukarno. He is willing to cooperate with President Sukarno as a civilian. Hatta advocated the establishment of a presidential cabinet, with him serving as an advisor to the president. However, he believes that a cooperative cabinet cannot be formed because some parties oppose this.

    哈达不愿重任副总统
    据新华社雅加达17日电　印度尼西亚国会成立的研究苏加诺总统和哈达前副总统合作问题的一个特别委员会在16日晚间向国会报告说，哈达表示不愿意重新担任副总统，也不愿意兼任国家计划委员会主席。
    这个特别委员会的主席阿里姆在报告过去两个星期内同苏加诺、哈达以及政府方面进行了三次会谈的结果时说，哈达在会谈中表示，他重新担任副总统并不是他同苏加诺总统恢复合作的唯一形式。他愿意以平民身份同苏加诺总统合作。哈达主张成立一个总统内阁，由他担任总统的顾问。但是，他认为不能促成组织一个合作内阁，因为有些党派反对这点。
