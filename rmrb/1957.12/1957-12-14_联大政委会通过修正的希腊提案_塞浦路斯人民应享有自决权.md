Xinhua News Agency, New York: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee passed an amended Greek proposal on Cyprus on December 12th by a vote of thirty-three to twenty (with twenty-five abstentions). The proposal states that the people of Cyprus should enjoy the right to self-determination.

The proposal expresses concern over the lack of progress made in resolving the Cyprus issue over the past year. It points out that "a solution needs to be reached at the earliest possible date to maintain peace and stability in the region" and earnestly hopes for "further negotiations and discussions in a spirit of cooperation with the aim of applying the right of self-determination to the people of Cyprus."

Socialist countries, most Asian and African countries, eight Latin American countries, as well as Greece, Iceland, and Ireland voted in favor. Britain, France, and other countries voted against it. Abstentions included India and the United States.

Prior to this, on December 10th, U.S. Representative Lodge defended Britain at the meeting, calling for "quiet diplomacy" on the Cyprus issue. He believed that this issue did not need to be resolved by the United Nations.

    联大政委会通过修正的希腊提案
    塞浦路斯人民应享有自决权
    据新华社讯　纽约消息：联合国大会政治委员会12日以三十三票对二十票（二十五票弃权）通过了经过修正的关于塞浦路斯的希腊提案，提案指出塞浦路斯人民应当享有自决权。
    提案对过去一年在解决塞浦路斯问题方面没有获得进展表示关心，它指出“需要在尽可能早的时期内取得一个解决办法来保持这个地区的和平和稳定”，并且殷切希望“本着合作精神，以使自决权适用于塞浦路斯人民为宗旨来进一步进行谈判和讨论”。
    社会主义国家、大部分亚非国家、八个拉丁美洲国家以及希腊、冰岛、爱尔兰投了赞成票。英法等国投了反对票，在弃权票中包括印度和美国。
    在这以前，美国代表洛奇在10日会议上替英国辩护，他要求在塞浦路斯问题上采用“静悄悄的外交”，他认为这个问题不必由联合国来解决。
