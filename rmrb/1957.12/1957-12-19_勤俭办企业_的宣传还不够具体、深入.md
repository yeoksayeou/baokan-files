    "Frugal Enterprise Management" Propaganda Still Lacks Specificity and Depth
    Since the Central Government called for "building the country through diligence and thrift," all aspects of the country have begun to pay attention to the issue of saving state funds. However, I feel that newspapers have not done enough in concretely promoting the idea of frugal enterprise management. Generally speaking, the spirit of "achieving more with less money" and "making do with whatever is available" is better implemented in local state-owned factories; among state-owned factories, small factories are better than large factories, and renovated factories are better than newly built factories. I believe that "building the country through diligence and thrift" requires joint efforts from top to bottom, and it is not enough to rely solely on the control and review of some central leading organs such as the State Planning Commission. Therefore, I suggest that your newspaper find some typical factories among local state-owned factories or state-owned factories that have better implemented the spirit of building the country through diligence and thrift in terms of investment use, collaborative thinking, and raw material utilization in production and capital construction, summarize their work experience, and publicize and introduce them in the newspaper. This can provide some inspiration and warning to units that waste more, and also encourage units that run enterprises arduously.

### “勤俭办企业”的宣传还不够具体、深入

    “勤俭办企业”的宣传还不够具体、深入
    自从中央号召“勤俭建国”以来，全国各方面已经开始注意节约国家资金的问题了，但我觉得报纸对勤俭办企业思想的具体宣传作得还不够。一般地说，
  “少花钱多办事”、“因陋就简”的精神，在地方国营厂贯彻得比较好；国营厂中是小厂比大厂好，改建厂比新建厂好。我认为“勤俭建国”必须要上下一齐动手，光靠国家计划委员会等一些中央领导机关的控制和审核是不够的。因此，我建议你报在地方国营工厂或国营工厂中找出一些在生产及基本建设上，对投资使用、协作思想及原材料利用等方面贯彻勤俭建国精神较好的典型工厂，总结他们的工作经验，在报上加以宣传和介绍。这样能给以浪费较多的单位有所启发和警惕，而对艰苦办企业的单位也有所鼓励。
