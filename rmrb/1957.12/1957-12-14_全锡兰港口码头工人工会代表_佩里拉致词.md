Comrades,

I am here as a representative of Ceylon, participating in the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions. Ceylon was once ruled by British imperialism for over a century and a half. For thousands of years, our small country of Ceylon and your large country of China have had many things in common in terms of religion, economy, and culture. Every illiterate person knows the name Fa Xian, who came to Ceylon during the Anuradhapura dynasty to study Buddhism. This fact further proves the connection between Ceylon and China since ancient times. In our history, there is also the name General Zheng He.

In the fifth century, Ceylon was a very good market for Chinese textiles. Your ancestors once exchanged their goods with Arab and European merchants in the ports of Ceylon. This was because the people of both countries enjoyed the freedom of trade at that time.

Since then, both of our countries have been trampled under the iron heel of Western imperialism, colonialism, and semi-colonialism. When Portugal conquered our country in the early sixteenth century, the institution of slavery began for the first time in Ceylon. The Portuguese deprived our ancestors of the equality and freedom they enjoyed, just like your ancestors, and they brought alcoholism and bribery. While uncivilized foreigners savagely plundered the country's wealth, our ancestors defended our independence in the Kandy region.

Following the Portuguese, came the Dutch, who lived in the coastal areas. They were also trained in the same school. Their system was no less than that of the Portuguese. After the British East India Company arrived in Ceylon, they seized the coastal provinces from the Dutch; subsequently, in 1815, the British invaded the Kandyan kingdom, arrested the last king of the Sinhalese and transported him as a prisoner to the port of Vellore in India. From then on, Ceylon completely lost its independence and remained under the iron rule of British imperialism until 1947.

The British imperialists who conquered Ceylon implemented the so-called "Waste Lands Ordinance," plundering all the land of the Sinhalese, just as France is doing now in Algeria. Westerners planted coffee in the Kandy region and invested foreign capital in Ceylon. Because the imperialists destroyed ancient rivers, ponds, lakes, and streams during their rule, today we must allocate 26 million rupees from our national income to import rice from abroad. This is the dowry given to us by British imperialism.

Our beautiful island is famous throughout the world for tea, rubber, and coconuts. The main possessors of these lands are still British imperialists. This is not to say that there are no domestic landlords. But domestic landlords also complain because their skin is black. The British imperialists never allowed Ceylon to develop industry because they believed that it would be a blow to their industrial cities such as Manchester and Sheffield. In 1818, three years after the demise of the Sinhalese kingdom, feudal elements who had lost their privileges due to British rule organized a revolt against British rule, but they failed.

In 1840, the national income depended entirely on coffee cultivation. Around 1848, coffee cultivation was hit by pests, and the national income suddenly decreased. Due to the sudden decrease in national income, the British government levied a special tax, increasing the burden on the people of Ceylon. The people of our inland mountainous regions, severely persecuted in both ways, organized an uprising in 1848. As a result, the Sinhalese seized several British fortresses in the Kandy region. This uprising was led by some civilians such as Gongal Godapanda and Bulan Apo. As a result, the uprising was brutally suppressed, and the leaders were arrested and sentenced to death. This was the first truly people-led uprising in our country against British colonialism.

Now, I want to talk about a glorious page in our history. 1935 is a famous year on this page. During this period, beautiful socialism from the doctrines of Karl Marx and Lenin appeared in Ceylon. The "Lanka Sama Samaja Party" headed by Comrade Philip Gunawardena was born under the principles of Marxism and Leninism; he had participated in the Marxist-Leninist movements in America, Britain, and Spain. Later, the workers also accepted Marxism and Leninism, and they stood on the front lines against imperialism. I am a member of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party, and in 1937, I led a strike in the inland, where Comrade Govindan was shot and killed by the imperialist police of Moroya. During the Second World War, the activities of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party were banned. During the war, the Lanka Sama Samaja Party entrusted me with organizing activities secretly. From then on, there was an opportunity to serve Marxism and the labor movement of Ceylon.

During this period, Comrade Philip Gunawardena and the leaders of the Sama Samaja Party movement were arrested and detained. From then on, the secret organization led workers and peasants against British imperialism.

On Easter in 1943, Japanese imperialists bombed Colombo. At the same time, the leaders of the Sama Samaja Party escaped from prison. They fled to India, where they participated in the anti-imperialist movement. At the end of the war, the Sama Samaja Party became a legal political party.

In 1945, the Lanka Sama Samaja Party led the strike of barge workers in the port of Colombo. The port workers fought bravely, and the strike was victorious. During the strike struggle, a police inspector named Banda from the imperialist police force died, and the leaders of the strike, such as Comrade Philip Gunawardena and I, were arrested and imprisoned. The "All-Ceylon Port and Dock Workers' Union" was formed around this time in 1945.

In 1946, a general strike occurred and was victorious. The general strike that broke out in 1947 was brutally suppressed by the imperialists, and bloodshed occurred. The British imperialists saw the united working class and then granted Ceylon independence in 1947. The Lanka Sama Samaja Party won more seats in the 1947 election and became the main opposition party in the first parliament of Ceylon.

Following in the footsteps of the Russian October Revolution of 1917, according to that great milestone, we organized our labor movement and formulated our party's policies. I am proud to say that we are now studying the results of the great Chinese Revolution of 1949.

Today, the trade union movement in Ceylon is developing faster than at any time in Ceylon's history. Our government has nationalized privately owned bus companies. Our government has nationalized the port, and the Trincomalee naval base and the Katunayake airport have been transferred to us from the imperialists. Now, there is no threat of war from any country on our island, and at the same time, the imperialists have lost the opportunity to use our country as a base to attack great China. I believe that when the time is ripe, the tea and rubber plantations belonging to British capitalists will eventually be nationalized.

Thank you all.

    全锡兰港口码头工人工会代表
    佩里拉致词同志们：
    我是作为锡兰的一个代表参加中国工会第八次全国代表大会。锡兰曾经被英帝国主义统治了一个半世纪以上。几千年来，我们锡兰这个小国家和你们中国这个大国家，在宗教、经济和文化方面有着许多共同点。每一个不识字的人都知道巴希汗·泰罗这个名字，他在阿努拉达波尔朝代时曾到锡兰研究佛教。这一事实更加证明了锡兰和中国自古以来就有了联系。在我们的历史上，也有秦和将军的名字。
    在五世纪时，锡兰是中国纺织品的一个非常好的市场。你们的祖先曾经在锡兰的港口，同阿拉伯与欧洲的商人交换过他们的商品。这是因为那时两国人民都享有贸易的自由。
    自那时以后，我们两个国家都受着西方帝国主义、殖民主义和半殖民主义制度的铁蹄的践踏。当葡萄牙在十六世纪初征服了我们的国家后，在锡兰第一次开始了奴隶制度的政府。葡萄牙人剥夺了我们祖先所享有的、同你们祖先一样的平等和自由，他们带来了酗酒和贿赂。当不文明的外国人野蛮地夺取这个国家的财富时，我们的祖先就在康第扬地区保卫着我们的独立。
    继葡萄牙人之后，又来了荷兰人，他们居住在沿海地区。他们也是同一个学院里训练出来的。他们的制度也不亚于葡萄牙人。英国东印度公司到了锡兰后，从荷兰人手中夺取了沿海各省；随后，英国人在1815年侵犯了康第扬王朝，逮捕了僧迦罗族最后一个国王，把他当作俘虏运送印度的维罗尔港。从此，锡兰就完全失去了独立，到1947年为止，它一直在英帝国主义的铁蹄统治之下。
    征服了锡兰的英帝国主义者实行了所谓“荒地法”，掠夺了僧迦罗人的全部土地，就像法国现在在阿尔及利亚的所作所为一样。西方人在康第扬地区种植了咖啡，并且在锡兰投下了外国资本。由于帝国主义者在他们统治的时期内毁坏了古代的河流、池塘、湖泊和小溪，今天，我们必须从我国的国民收入中拨出二千六百万卢比从外国进口大米。这是英帝国主义者送给我们的嫁妆。
    我们美丽的岛屿，以茶、橡胶和椰子著名于世。这些土地的主要占有者仍然是英帝国主义者。这并不是说，那里没有本国的地主阶级。但是本国的地主也有抱怨，因为他们的皮肤是黑的。英帝国主义者从来就不让锡兰发展工业，因为他们认为，这对他们的工业城市如曼彻斯特、西菲尔特是一个打击。在1818年，也就是僧迦罗国王亡国后的第三年，由于英国统治而丧失了特权的封建分子，组织了一次暴动来反对英国统治，但是他们失败了。
    1840年，国民收入完全依靠着咖啡种植。大约在1848年前后，咖啡种植受到了虫害的打击，国民收入突然减少了。由于国民收入的突然减少，英国政府征收了一种特别税，加重了锡兰人民的负担。在两方面都受到严重迫害的我国内地山区人民，在1848年组织了一次起义。结果僧迦罗人夺取了康第扬地区的几个英国要塞。这次起义是由钢果尔·戈达彭达和布兰·阿波等一些平民领导的。结果，起义被残酷地镇压下去，领袖们被捕，并且被判处了死刑。这是第一次真正由我国人民领导的反对英国殖民主义的起义。
    现在，我要谈谈我国历史上光辉的一页。1935年是这一页中著名的一年。在这个时期，来自卡尔·马克思和列宁学说的美好的社会主义在锡兰出现了。以菲力浦·古那瓦邓同志为首的“锡兰平等社会党”在马克思主义和列宁主义的原则下诞生了，他曾参加过美国、英国和西班牙的马克思、列宁主义运动。后来，工人们也接受了马克思主义和列宁主义，他们站在反对帝国主义的前线。我是锡兰平等社会党的党员，1937年在内地领导了一次罢工，戈文登同志就是在那里被摩洛亚的帝国主义警察所枪杀的。在帝国主义第二次世界大战期间，锡兰平等社会党的活动被禁止了。在大战期间，锡兰平等社会党委托我秘密组织活动。从此，就有了为马克思主义和锡兰的工人运动服务的机会。
    在这一时期，菲力浦·古那瓦邓同志和平等社会党运动的领袖们被捕和被拘禁起来了。从那时起，秘密组织领导了工人和农民反对英帝国主义。
    1943年复活节时，日本帝国主义者轰炸了科伦坡。同一时期，平等社会党的领袖们逃出了监狱。他们逃亡到印度，在那里参加了反对帝国主义运动。在战争结束时，平等社会党成了一个合法的政党。
    1945年，锡兰平等社会党领导了科伦坡港口的驳船工人罢工。港口工人勇敢地进行了斗争，罢工取得了胜利，在罢工斗争中，帝国主义警察部队里一名叫班达的警察巡官死亡了，领导罢工的领袖如菲力浦·古那瓦邓同志和我都被捕、监禁起来。“全锡兰港口和码头工人工会”就是在1945年这个时候成立的。
    1946年，一个总罢工发生了，并且取得了胜利。1947年爆发的总罢工被帝国主义者残酷地镇压下去了，发生了流血事件。英帝国主义者看见工人阶级团结一致，于是就在1947年让锡兰独立。锡兰平等社会党在1947年选举中获得了更多席位，成为锡兰第一届议会中的主要反对党。
    随着1917年俄国十月革命的足迹，按照那一伟大的里程碑，我们组织了我们的工人运动并且制定了我们党的政策。我骄傲地说，现在我们正在研究伟大中国1949年革命的成果。
    今天锡兰的工会运动同锡兰历史上任何时期比起来，它的发展是快的。我国政府将私人所有的公共汽车公司收归国有。我国政府将港口国有化了，亭可马里海军基地和卡屠纳雅克飞机场已经从帝国主义手中移交给我们了。现在我们岛上没有来自任何国家的战争威胁，同时，帝国主义者已失去以我国作为基地来进攻伟大中国的机会了。我相信当时机成熟时，属于英国资本家的茶园和橡胶园最后也将实行国有化的。
    谢谢大家。
