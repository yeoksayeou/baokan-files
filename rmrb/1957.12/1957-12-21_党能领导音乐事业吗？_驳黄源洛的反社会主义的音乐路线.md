    Can the Party Lead the Music Industry?
    ——Refuting Huang Yuanluo's Anti-Socialist Music Line
    Li Huanzhi
    Since the Party put forward the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," the right-wing composer Huang Yuanluo has used various meetings to promote his series of anti-socialist musical remarks, especially attacking the Party's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" wantonly, distorting Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" out of context, and denying the achievements of the socialist music industry…and so on. While denying that the Party can lead music work, he put forward an anti-socialist music work program.
    In April of this year, at the "Symposium of Musicians in Beijing" held by the editorial department of "People's Music," Huang Yuanluo made the following assessment of the current state of music work: "To implement the policy of 'Let a hundred flowers bloom' in the music circle, it is still necessary to improve the gardener's skills and understand flowers. The current flowers are not all in bud, but many flowers are still just seeds (or, some even have to find ways to collect seeds), the seeds are deeply buried in the hearts of composers, how to arrange gardens for these seeds, give them some conditions to make them flourish, and there is still a lot of work to do, and many specific measures to be taken, it is not enough to just shout 'release'." (For the full text of the speech, see "People's Music" May 1957 issue)
    That is to say: the flowers of music have not yet bloomed, because the garden has not been arranged, and some do not even have seeds! The "Let a hundred flowers bloom" proposed by the Communist Party is just shouting in words.
    Since the music scene is so "barren," then, may I ask, what is the root cause of this situation? Huang Yuanluo's conclusion is: "The reason for this is historical, the fate of music is not in the hands of music workers, but in the hands of people 'outside the industry' (dare not call them "laymen"),... music needs to have relatively independent views, to maintain the healthy development of the music and cultural cause, cannot be manipulated by others, let alone obey orders." (Ibid.)
    Isn't it very obvious: the music industry cannot be "manipulated" by the Party and the government (the so-called "outsiders"), music needs to have "relatively independent views" from socialist ideology, and "even more" cannot "obey" the "orders" of the Party and the government.
    Although Huang Yuanluo verbally "admits that the Party can lead cultural and artistic work," supports Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," and believes that Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policy is "a further determination of the literary and artistic policy of the May Fourth Movement." However, let us listen to how Huang Yuanluo understands the "May Fourth Movement" and Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policy? He said:
    "The May Fourth Movement was a great cultural revolution movement in Chinese history. Without the May Fourth Movement, I am afraid there would be no scientists, engineers, and educators present who first had patriotic ideas, no new music workers, no spread of Marxism-Leninism in China, and China's social progress would be delayed for many years. In terms of culture, the May Fourth Movement opened the door to Western academic research and severely criticized feudal and backward culture. At this time, culture could only be promoted to the intellectuals (basically the petty bourgeoisie). Chairman Mao's Yan'an Literary and Art Symposium in 1942, after revolutionary practice, further determined the literary and artistic policy of the May Fourth Movement and promoted it to the grassroots masses, that is, the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers." (Speech at the Symposium of Senior Intellectuals of the General Political Department)
    The assessment of the May Fourth Movement is the starting point of Huang Yuanluo's anti-socialist ideological system. He thought that by grasping "opening the door to Western academic research" and "severely criticizing feudal and backward culture," he could prove that he and Chairman Mao's "one hand reaching out to the West" were consistent, and he could also use it to oppose "some of our cultural department leaders" who "overemphasize people's habits," "deny modern music theory and technology," and therefore "forget the spirit of the May Fourth Movement."
    In fact, Huang Yuanluo's so-called "May Fourth Spirit," in addition to "opening the door to Western academic research," is the culture of "intellectuals" who are "basically petty bourgeois." Therefore, Huang Yuanluo attempted to deny the historical fact that the May Fourth Movement was guided by communist ideology. He only said that it was because of the May Fourth Movement that Marxism-Leninism was spread in China. (Probably because the Communist Party of China was born after the May Fourth Movement.) In this way, the May Fourth Movement seems to have been led by the bourgeoisie.
    Regarding the historical characteristics of the May Fourth New Culture Movement, Chairman Mao stated very clearly in "On New Democracy":
    "On the cultural front or ideological front in China, the period before the 'May Fourth' and the period after the 'May Fourth' constitute two different historical periods.
    "Before the 'May Fourth,' the struggle on the Chinese cultural front was the struggle between the new culture of the bourgeoisie and the old culture of the feudal class. Before the 'May Fourth,' the struggle between schools and the imperial examination, the struggle between new learning and old learning, and the struggle between Western learning and Chinese learning all had this nature.
    "After the 'May Fourth,' it was different. After the 'May Fourth,' China produced a completely new cultural force, which is the communist cultural thought led by the Chinese Communists, namely the communist worldview and social revolution theory...
    "Before the 'May Fourth,' the new culture of China was a culture of the old democratic nature, belonging to a part of the capitalist cultural revolution of the world bourgeoisie. After the 'May Fourth,' the new culture of China was a culture of the new democratic nature, belonging to a part of the socialist cultural revolution of the world proletariat."
    Why is Huang Yuanluo unwilling to admit the great influence of the Russian October Revolution on the May Fourth Movement? Is he unwilling to admit the leading and organizational role played by communist intellectuals represented by Li Dazhao in the May Fourth Movement? Is he unwilling to admit that the historical characteristic of the May Fourth Movement was a revolutionary struggle against imperialism and feudalism in which the broad masses of the people participated (the Chinese working class launched the first strike with political goals on June 3, 1919)? Obviously, Huang Yuanluo just wants to distort history to deny the Party's leading role in the new cultural cause since the May Fourth.
    Huang Yuanluo always thinks that he is the one who understands what is called "advanced" and what is called "backward" the most. However, his understanding of the "May Fourth Spirit" precisely reverses the advanced and the backward. The so-called "opening the door to Western academic research" is not the main characteristic of the new culture after the May Fourth, but the "Westernization" movement that began in the second half of the nineteenth century with "Chinese learning as the foundation, Western learning for practical application," and even Kang and Liang's "Reform Movement of 1898." This series of bourgeois reformist political movements had already opened their arms to Western capitalist culture. In music, Western music was also introduced into China through the piano courses in church schools. This is the bourgeois old democratic cultural revolution.
    The new culture after the May Fourth is the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal culture of the people led by the proletariat, which has nothing in common with Huang Yuanluo's so-called "May Fourth Spirit." Chairman Mao called the new culture since the May Fourth "national, scientific, and mass culture." These three characteristics are the specific manifestations of the spiritual essence of the May Fourth New Culture Movement.
    We might as well use these three characteristics to measure Huang Yuanluo's "May Fourth Spirit."
    Huang Yuanluo once used a formula to explain his "May Fourth Spirit." He said: "What is advanced music art? I think it should be: national form → creative processing through modern music theory and technology → national form (equivalent to the formula of unity, transformation, and unity)." This is Huang Yuanluo's basic attitude towards national heritage. The so-called "modern music theory and technology" is just a different name for "Western music technology." In Huang Yuanluo's view, the musical heritage of any nation is "primitive" and "backward" material, which must be "created and processed" through the "Western music" furnace to succeed in the "Huang Yuanluo style" national form. In fact, Huang Yuanluo takes a completely negative attitude towards the issue of inheriting national heritage. For example, he said:
    "Some people think that strengthening national folk learning is beneficial. I think there are benefits, but the loss is not worth it..."
    "New music can stimulate human wisdom and help people be sensitive to new things. On the contrary, old tunes make life conservative."
    "I think that fixed tunes, whether they are signs or boards, will only hinder the development of music culture... There is no benefit in clinging to the signs and boards and treating them as national advantages." (Speech at the New Opera Symposium)
    "If we want to obey the traditional habits of the masses, we cannot adopt equal temperament in a hurry; if we cannot adopt equal temperament, a series of theoretical problems cannot be solved, and our country's music will stagnate in its natural form and cannot move forward... One says to obey science, and the other says to obey the habits of the masses." (The issue of national form in music creation)
    This series of arguments is nothing more than setting the national music tradition against the so-called "new music," believing that the national music heritage has no "advantages" at all, and opposing "the masses' traditional habits" with "science," as if respecting the national tradition is anti-"science" and will "make our country's music stagnate in its natural form."
    Since the advantages of the national music tradition are fundamentally denied, and the decisive role of Western music technology is emphasized blindly, what kind of "national form" can be "created" as a result? Therefore, Huang Yuanluo said: "This flower is still in the initial stage of cultivation," and is "the weakest flower today." Isn't this a general obliteration of the achievements made by Chinese new music creation in nationalization since the May Fourth Movement!
    According to Huang Yuanluo's intention, Chinese national music should be transformed by Western music technology, and the flower that blooms in this way is "the flower that will bloom the most brilliantly in the future." What kind of "nationalization" of music is this? Isn't this a thorough "Westernization" of the nation!
    Then, let's look at Huang Yuanluo's "science"?
    In all of Huang Yuanluo's speeches and articles, there are many pleasant words such as "modern music theory and technology," "advanced art," "modern art level," and "scientific theoretical basis," as well as "advanced" concepts such as "spirit of the times," "moving forward," "creating new sounds," and "sensitivity to new things." But what is the "spiritual essence" hidden under these beautiful hats? After all, it is still a "Western music technology." Western music technology is "the panacea" in Huang Yuanluo's eyes. With it, "backward" national music can become "advanced art," with it, "the masses' traditional habits" can "move forward" according to the "scientific theoretical basis," with it, we can "break out" of the "superstition" of national music and "create new sounds" and have the "spirit of the times." In short, with it, "it is the only way for us to rise from the dead" (Huang Yuanluo's remarks during the rectification movement in 1957). If anyone does not take his "panacea," then "everything is in vain," "without life, without soul, without future," "tied together all day long, becoming a huge manure machine" (ibid.).
    All the meaning of Huang Yuanluo's "science" lies here.
    Huang Yuanluo's "formula of advanced art" violates history. Chairman Mao said: "The new culture of China today is also developed from the old culture of ancient times. Therefore, we must respect our own history and must not cut off history. But this respect is to give history a certain scientific status, and to respect the dialectical development of history." Huang Yuanluo denies the artistic value of the national music heritage, does not give it a certain scientific status, and believes that the old culture is "backward" and "unscientific." Therefore, composers do not need to learn too much national music, because "a little is also a little, and a little can also create." As long as there is Western music technology, it is enough to transform and replace the art of one's own nation. Is this violation of the laws of historical development a scientific historical viewpoint?
    Huang Yuanluo's "formula of advanced art" is divorced from real life. The "new national form" he wants to create can be successful just by "transforming" the old form through Western technology. Real life and the spirit of the times have no place in his formula. Moreover, according to Huang Yuanluo, composers of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois origin do not need to study Marxism-Leninism and do not need ideological reform, because: "People who study music theory and creation are somewhat guided by the May Fourth thought, and are not far from Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policy." Therefore, as long as there is Western music technology, new sounds can be "created." This anti-realist creative method is permeated with the decadent aesthetic viewpoint of bourgeois formalism from the inside out. This ideological system is full of the corrupt philosophical viewpoint of bourgeois idealism from top to bottom. Is there half a scent of an advanced materialist in it, or a trace of the ground of scientific thought and objective truth!
    Huang Yuanluo worships Western music technology to the point of superstition. Isn't this a thorough anti-scientific act!
    Then, in Huang Yuanluo's "May Fourth Spirit," where is the "mass" characteristic reflected?
    Huang Yuanluo believes that Chairman Mao's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art in 1942 was "a further determination of the literary and artistic policy of the May Fourth Movement, and promoted it to the grassroots masses, that is, the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers." If we look at the "May Fourth Spirit" as interpreted by Huang Yuanluo, then Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policy is to make "opening the door to Western academic research" a "further determination" and "promote" it "to the grassroots masses." This is "popularization." No wonder Huang Yuanluo wants to say that "advanced works of art are understood and accepted by the masses only after a considerable period of education," because "there is a distance and a contradiction between professional colleges and mass organizations; how should this contradiction be resolved?" "The masses are not experts. The things that experts have researched should be gradually promoted among the masses..." But "this is often emphasized 'habit' and deepens their contradiction." However, "in order to cater to the habits of the masses, it is also possible to accommodate the masses a little bit. This is the work that a Party propagandist should do. Isn't this solvable?"
    The argument is very clear: "Mass habits" should not be emphasized. The works of "experts" who meet Huang Yuanluo's "May Fourth Spirit" - "should be promoted among the masses" and "understood and accepted by the masses only after a considerable period of education." If, "in order to cater to the habits of the masses," it is necessary to "accommodate the masses a little bit," then this is not the work of "experts," but the work of the so-called "Party propagandists."
    Huang Yuanluo criticizes us "cultural department leaders" everywhere for "overemphasizing people's habits." Look at how "indignant" he is in opposing "habits": "When vulgar sociological viewpoints are combined with dogmatism, the space for music has been fixed in their minds. 'Habits' can replace everything. New life is opposed to habits, creating new sounds is opposed to habits, and modern music theory and technology in the world's knowledge treasury are opposed to habits..." Because the leadership "only looks at it from one angle (whether it is the most familiar and most habitual to the masses at present) to review and evaluate any music creation," "this treats the music industry as a general commodity," and "thinks that this is called 'reality'—reality is 'cashing out'." (Quoted from Huang Yuanluo's speech at the Symposium of Senior Intellectuals of the General Political Department)
    What is "habit"? The "people's habit" that Huang Yuanluo clamors against is a concept with a broad meaning. "Habit" refers to our national music tradition, "habit" refers to things that the people like to see and hear, "habit" refers to the artistic taste of the masses, "habit" refers to the people's emotions and thoughts, and even the revolutionary tradition and socialist moral qualities of the working people are "habits" in Huang Yuanluo's eyes. In short, "habit" represents everything of the masses. Huang Yuanluo is attacking the Party's mass line in literary and artistic policy in the name of opposing "habit."
    Why does Huang Yuanluo oppose Comrade Zhou Yang's "hard搬柏林斯基的话, 就是: '要改变人民的习惯, 等于把他捆起来用鞭子抽他, 赶着他走’”？ Isn't it precisely because Huang Yuanluo hates "the habits of the people"! Huang Yuanluo also dreams of returning to the era of the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang that has gone and will never return, where he can arrogantly ride on the heads of the people and use his bourgeois rightist "May Fourth Spirit" to "tie up the people, whip them, and drive them away"!
    What kind of "popularization" is this? This is a thorough "popularization"!
    Huang Yuanluo's entire ideological system of the "May Fourth Spirit" is like this. He attempts to rewrite the history of the new music movement with the pen of the reactionary bourgeois rightists, to deny the Party's leadership in the literary and artistic cause, and to obliterate all the achievements of the socialist music industry.
    Therefore, Huang Yuanluo's assessment of the music industry led by the Party is: "Vulgar sociology shrouds the airspace of music, and the thinking of musicians is imprisoned." "Under this kind of ideological domination, the thoughts of 'anti-foreign dogmatism' and 'revivalism' converge, and 'guerrilla tactics' and 'vulgar sociology' converge, producing a set of formulas for leading literary and artistic work." Therefore, "the leadership, truly for the business, is empty. There is no real ideological weapon combined with practice. He only has a red-tasseled spear, and it is rusty. The higher up the weapon is, the more rusty it becomes. One layer and two layers, the higher up it is, the more it follows behind." (Speech at the rectification group meeting of the Song and Dance Troupe of the Political Department of the Navy)
    How Huang Yuanluo hates "guerrilla tactics" and "red-tasseled spears"! However, these two things are so closely accompanied by the history of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle. The "red-tasseled spear" itself is certainly a relatively primitive weapon, but when it is under the leadership of the most advanced - communist - strategic thinking and in the hands of the broad masses of workers and peasants, this weapon is invincible. Huang Yuanluo is only attacking the Party's revolutionary tradition and the Party's mass line in the name of opposing the backward "red-tasseled spear," that is, attacking Marxism-Leninism and communist ideology in the name of opposing "vulgar sociology."
    History cannot be rewritten. The history of the new music movement proves that only when musicians and composers accept communist ideology and the leadership of the Communist Party can the Chinese music industry embark on the most thorough road of nationalization, scientification, and popularization. We say that Nie Er is the first socialist realist composer in our country. Since him, under the ideological leadership of the Party, a stronger and stronger new force of music has been formed, paving the way for the Chinese socialist music industry. Here, we do not underestimate the contributions of patriotic composers with democratic ideas in China since the May Fourth Movement, such as Xiao Youmei, Huang Zi, and Zhao Yuanren, to the Chinese new music industry. Their hard work is a component of the new music culture since the May Fourth Movement. However, because they did not accept the leadership of communist ideology, although they wrote many patriotic works with democratic ideas, they also wrote songs like "Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth" (Huang Zi) and "New Life Movement Song" (Zhao Yuanren) that maintained the rule of the reactionary class and maintained the reactionary social order. Their creative path is not the most thorough nationalization, scientification, and popularization.
    The music industry led by the Party is closely linked to the interests of the working masses from the beginning. The Party is always watching and caring about the growth of the music industry. Therefore, the guidelines and policies put forward by the Party in various periods of the revolution have powerfully promoted the music work. In particular, Chairman Mao's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art in 1942 encouraged music workers to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers more firmly, to learn from the folk and from the masses more deeply and conscientiously, and to work hard to transform their thinking. Therefore, many new achievements have been made in music work.
    Since the national liberation, the Party has put forward the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" for the development of science and culture, which is precisely a call to welcome the upsurge of socialist cultural construction. However, Huang Yuanluo deliberately distorts and denies the great significance of the Party's guidelines and policies, saying that "the flowers of music art have not yet bloomed," and the Party's policies are only "preparing the preconditions for the future blooming." Huang Yuanluo also fantasizes that the Party's policies will "prepare the preconditions" and "arrange gardens" for his anti-socialist "flowers"! The policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom" will never prepare any conditions or "arrange gardens" for bourgeois art. The flowers of socialist music have sprouted, budded, bloomed, and bore fruit since Nie Er. The Party's policies encourage us to engage in creative labor more actively and to open up a wider garden for socialist culture and art. No social system in history can compare with socialist society in solving the relationship between art and the people so thoroughly, in inheriting all the cultural achievements created by the wisdom of predecessors so correctly, and in respecting one's own national art while equally respecting the art of other nations.
    "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" is a powerful guarantee for the further prosperity of socialist culture.

### 党能领导音乐事业吗？——驳黄源洛的反社会主义的音乐路线

    党能领导音乐事业吗？
    ——驳黄源洛的反社会主义的音乐路线
    李焕之
    自从党提出了“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针以来，右派作曲家黄源洛就利用各种会议来宣扬他一系列的反社会主义的音乐言论，尤其是对党的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针肆意攻击，对毛主席的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”作断章取义的歪曲，对社会主义音乐事业所获得的成就一笔抹煞……等等。他在否定党能领导音乐工作的同时，提出了一个反社会主义的音乐工作纲领。
    今年4月，在“人民音乐”编辑部召开的“在京音乐家座谈会”上，黄源洛对目前音乐工作的状况，就作了如下的估价：“在音乐界要贯彻‘百花齐放’这一政策，首先还是要提高园丁的技术，要懂得花。目前的花并不是都已经含苞待放，而是有许多花还只是种子（或者，有些甚至连种子都还要设法搜罗），种子深深埋在作曲家们心里，如何为这些种子安排园地，给他一些条件让他枝繁叶茂，还要做很多的工作，还要进行许多具体措施，单单叫‘放’是不够的。”（发言全文见“人民音乐”1957年5月号）
    这就是说：音乐之花还没有开放，因为园地还没有安排好，有的连种子都还没有呢！共产党提出的“百花齐放”还只是在口头上叫喊而已。
    音乐界既是如此“荒芜”，那么，请问，造成这种局面的根源何在呢？黄源洛的结论是：“这原因是有历史的，音乐的命运不掌握在音乐工作者手里，而掌握在‘行外’（不敢叫他们“外行”）人士手里的结果，……音乐需要有相对的独立主张，要维护音乐文化事业的健康发展，不能由人摆布，更不能唯命是从。”（同上）
    事情不就很明显了吗：音乐事业不能由党和政府（即所谓“行外”者）来“摆布”，音乐需要有和社会主义思想“相对的独立主张”，“更”不能“唯”党和政府之“命”是从。
    虽然黄源洛在口头上是“承认党能领导文化艺术”的，是拥护毛主席的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”的，而且认为毛主席的文艺方针是“五四运动的文艺方针的进一步确定”。可是，我们听听黄源洛对于“五四运动”和毛主席的文艺方针是怎样理解的呢？他说：
    “五四运动是中国历史上一个伟大的文化革命运动，没有五四运动，恐怕就没有在座的首先具有爱国主义思想的科学家、工程师、教育家，没有新音乐工作者，没有马克思列宁主义在中国的传播，中国的社会进步，还不知要推迟若干年。在文化方面，五四运动敞开了向西洋学术研究的大门，严厉批判了封建落后文化。这时候，文化方面还只能推动到知识分子（基本上是小资产阶级）方面，1942年毛主席延安文艺座谈会，是经过革命实践，把五四运动的文艺方针进一步确定，推动到基层群众，就是工农兵方向。”（在总政高级知识分子座谈会上的发言）
    对于五四运动的估价，是黄源洛的反社会主义思想体系的出发点。他以为抓住了“敞开了向西洋学术研究的大门”和“严厉批判了封建落后文化”，就可以证明他和毛主席的“一手伸向西洋”是一致的，他也就可以用来反对“我们有些文化部门领导”“过分强调人民习惯”，“否认现代音乐理论技术”，因此是“忘记了五四运动的精神实质”。
    其实黄源洛的所谓“五四精神”，除了“敞开了向西洋学术研究的大门”之外，就是“基本上是小资产阶级”“知识分子”的文化。所以黄源洛是企图否认五四运动是在共产主义思想指导下的历史事实，他只说因为有了五四运动才有马列主义在中国的传播。（大概因为中国共产党是诞生在五四运动之后的缘故吧。）这样说来，五四运动似乎是资产阶级所领导的了。
    关于五四新文化运动的历史特点，毛主席在“新民主主义论”里说得很明确：
    “在中国文化战线或思想战线上，‘五四’以前和‘五四’以后，构成了两个不同的历史时期。
    “在‘五四’以前，中国文化战线上的斗争，是资产阶级的新文化和封建阶级的旧文化的斗争。在‘五四’以前，学校与科举之争，新学与旧学之争，西学与中学之争，都带有这种性质。
    “‘五四’以后则不然。在‘五四’以后，中国产生了完全崭新的文化生力军，这就是中国共产党人所领导的共产主义的文化思想，即共产主义的宇宙观和社会革命论。……
    “在‘五四’以前，中国的新文化，是旧民主主义性质的文化，属于世界资产阶级的资本主义的文化革命的一部分。在‘五四’以后，中国的新文化，却是新民主主义性质的文化，属于世界无产阶级的社会主义的文化革命的一部分。”
    为什么黄源洛不愿意承认俄国十月革命对五四运动的巨大影响呢？不愿意承认以李大钊为代表的共产主义知识分子对五四运动所起的领导作用与组织作用呢？不愿意承认五四运动的历史特点是广大人民群众参加的（中国工人阶级在1919年6月3日发动了第一次有政治目的的罢工）反帝反封建的革命斗争呢？很显然的，黄源洛不过想歪曲历史，来否认党在五四以来的新文化事业上的领导作用而已。
    黄源洛总以为自己是最懂得什么叫“先进”和什么叫“落后”的，然而他所认识的“五四精神”，恰恰是把先进和落后倒置了。所谓“敞开向西洋学术研究的大门”，并不是五四以后的新文化的主要特点，而是五四以前，始于十九世纪下半期的“中学为体，西学为用”的“洋务”运动，以至康、梁的“变法维新”，这一系列的资产阶级改良主义的政治运动，就已经是向西洋资本主义文化伸开了双手了。在音乐方面，西洋音乐也通过了教会学校中的琴科而输入中国。这是资产阶级旧民主主义的文化革命。
    五四以后的新文化，就是无产阶级领导的人民大众反帝反封建的文化，这和黄源洛的所谓“五四精神”是毫无共同之点的。毛主席把五四以来的新文化叫做“民族的科学的大众的文化”，这三个特征，就是五四新文化运动的精神实质的具体表现。
    我们不妨根据这三个特征来衡量一下黄源洛的“五四精神”吧。
    黄源洛曾经用一个公式来说明他的“五四精神”，他说：“先进的音乐艺术是什么呢？我以为应该是：民族形式→经过现代音乐理论技术创造加工→民族形式（相当于团结、改造、团结的公式）”，这就是黄源洛对待民族遗产的基本态度。所谓“现代音乐理论技术”不过是“西洋音乐技术”的异名同音。任何民族的音乐遗产，在黄源洛看来都是“原始的”、“落后”的材料，都必须经过“西洋音乐”的熔炉去“创造加工”，才能成功“黄源洛式”的民族形式。实际上，对于继承民族遗产这个问题，黄源洛是采取一概否定的态度，譬如他说：
    “有人觉得加强了民族民间学习有好处，我觉得好处是有的，但抵不上损失之大，……”
    “新的音乐是可以刺激人类智慧，使对新事物敏感有帮助的，相反的，旧曲调是使生活保守的。”
    “我认为固定曲调的牌子也好，板子也好，都只会阻碍音乐文化的发展。……死守着牌子板子不放松，并且把它当作民族优点是没有什么好处的。”（新歌剧座谈会上的发言）
    “要服从群众的传统习惯，就不能急忙的采用平均律；不能采用平均律，一系列的理论问题就不能解决，而使我国音乐停滞于自然形态，不能向前发展；……一个说要服从科学，一个说要服从群众习惯。”（音乐上创作的民族形式问题）
    这一系列的论点，无非是把民族音乐传统和所谓“新的音乐”对立起来，认为民族音乐遗产根本谈不上什么“优点”，并且把“群众的传统习惯”和“科学”对立起来，似乎尊重民族传统都是反“科学”的，都会“使我国音乐停滞于自然形态”。
    既然根本否定民族音乐传统的优点，而又一味强调西洋音乐技术的决定性的作用，其结果还会“创造”出什么“民族形式”来呢？所以黄源洛说：“这朵花现在还在最初的培养阶段”，是“今日最弱的一朵花”。这不就是一概抹煞了五四以来的中国新音乐创作在民族化方面所取得的成就吗！
    按照黄源洛的意图，应该是用西洋音乐技术来改造中国民族音乐，这样开出来的花，才是“未来会开得顶灿烂的一朵花”。这还有什么音乐的“民族化”呢，这难道不是彻头彻尾的用西洋来“化民族”吗！
    那么，我们再看黄源洛的“科学”吧？
    在黄源洛的一切发言和文章里，到处充满了：“现代音乐理论技术”、“先进的艺术”、“现代艺术水平”、“科学理论基础”等动听的词汇，还有什么“时代精神”、“向前发展”、“创造新声”、“新事物的敏感”等“先进”的概念。但是在这些美丽的帽子掩盖下的“精神实质”又是什么呢？说来说去还是一个“西洋音乐技术”。西洋音乐技术在黄源洛的眼里是“万灵金丹”，有了它，“落后”的民族音乐才能变成“先进的艺术”，有了它，“群众的传统习惯”才能按照“科学理论基础”而“向前发展”，有了它，才能“钻出”“迷信”民族音乐的圈套而“创新声”、而具有“时代精神”，总之，有了它，“才是我们起死回生的唯一法门”（黄源洛在1957年整风中的言论）。如果谁不吃他这颗“万灵金丹”，那么，“一切，白费工夫”，“没有生命、没有灵魂、没有前途”，“一天到晚捆在一起，成了一个巨大的造粪机”（同上）。
    黄源洛的“科学”的一切含义就在这里。
    黄源洛的“先进艺术的公式”，是违反历史的。毛主席说：“中国现时的新文化也是从古代的旧文化发展而来，因此，我们必须尊重自己的历史，决不能割断历史。但是这种尊重，是给历史以一定的科学的地位，是尊重历史的辩证法的发展”。黄源洛却否定民族音乐遗产的艺术价值，不给以一定的科学的地位，认为旧文化是“落后”的，“不科学”的。所以，作曲家不必太多地学习民族音乐，因为“有一点也就是一点，一点也可以创作”。只要有西洋的音乐技术就足够来改造和代替自己民族的艺术了。这种违反历史发展规律的作法，难道是科学的历史观点吗？
    黄源洛的“先进艺术的公式”，是脱离现实生活的。他所要创造的“新民族形式”，不过是旧形式经过西洋技术的“改造”就可以成功了的，现实生活、时代精神在他的公式中没有任何地位。而且按照黄源洛的说法，资产阶级和小资产阶级出身的作曲家，可以不必学习马列主义，可以不必思想改造，因为：“学习音乐理论创作的人，是多少受过五四思想指导的，同毛主席文艺方针并不是有多少距离的”。所以，只要有西洋的音乐技术，就可以“创造新声”。这种反现实主义的创作方法，是里里外外都渗透了没落的资产阶级形式主义的美学观点，这种思想体系，是上上下下都充满着腐朽的资产阶级唯心主义的哲学观点，难道这里面还有半点先进的唯物主义者的气味，还有一丝一毫的科学思想和客观真理的地盘吗！
    像黄源洛这种崇拜西洋音乐技术到了迷信的程度，这难道不是彻头彻尾的反科学的吗！
    那么，在黄源洛的“五四精神”中，“大众的”特征又表现在哪里呢？
    黄源洛认为1942年毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话是“把五四运动的文艺方针进一步确定，推动到基层群众，就是工农兵方向”。如果按照黄源洛所解释的“五四精神”来看，那么，毛主席的文艺方针就是把“敞开了向西洋学术研究的大门”作“进一步确定”，并且把它“推动到基层群众”，这就是“大众化”。无怪乎黄源洛要说“先进的艺术品是经过相当长的教育才为群众理解接受的”，因为“专业学院和群众团体之间是有距离的，有矛盾的；这矛盾应如何解决呢？”“群众不是专家，专家研究出来的东西，是应该在群众中逐步推广的……”但“这常被强调‘习惯’而加深了他们的矛盾”。不过，“为了群众习惯，也可以迁就一下群众，是一个从事党的宣传员应做的工作，这就不是可以解决吗？”
    论点十分清楚：“群众习惯”不应该强调，“专家”合乎黄源洛“五四精神”的“专家”——的作品“应该在群众中推广”，并且“经过相当长的教育才为群众理解接受”，如果，“为了群众习惯”而必须“迁就一下群众”时，那么，这不是“专家”的工作，而是所谓“从事党的宣传员”的工作了。
    黄源洛处处都批评我们“文化部门领导”是“过分强调人民习惯”，你看他是多么“愤慨”地在反对“习惯”啊：“庸俗社会学观点和教条主义结合起来，音乐空间在他们脑子里已经定型，
  ‘习惯’可以代替一切，新的生活和习惯对立，创作新声和习惯对立，世界知识宝库中的现代音乐理论技术和习惯对立，……”因为领导“仅从一个角度去看（是不是目前群众最熟悉的，最习惯的）来批评审定任何音乐创作”，“这就把音乐事业，当成一般商品看待”，而“认为这就叫‘现实’——现实就是‘兑现’”。（引自黄源洛在总政高级知识分子座谈会上的发言）
    什么叫“习惯”？黄源洛叫嚣着反对的“人民习惯”，是一个含义广泛的概念。“习惯”是指我们的民族音乐传统，“习惯”是指人民大众所喜闻乐见的事物，“习惯”是指群众的艺术趣味，“习惯”是指人民的感情与思想，甚至劳动人民的革命传统和社会主义的道德品质，在黄源洛眼里也都是“习惯”。总之，“习惯”代表着人民群众的一切，黄源洛就是借反对“习惯”之名来攻击党在文艺政策上的群众路线。
    黄源洛为什么要反对周扬同志“硬搬柏林斯基的话，就是：‘要改变人民的习惯，等于把他捆起来用鞭子抽他，赶着他走’”呢？不正是因为黄源洛仇视“人民的习惯”吗！黄源洛还梦想着回到那已经一去不复返的国民党反动派统治的年代里，可以蛮横地骑在人民的头上，用他的资产阶级右派的“五四精神”，来“把人民捆起来，用鞭子抽他，赶着他走”呢！
    这是什么“大众化”啊？这是彻头彻尾的“化大众”！
    黄源洛的整个“五四精神”的思想体系就是如此。他企图用反动的资产阶级右派的笔来改写新音乐运动的历史，来否定党对文艺事业的领导，来抹煞社会主义音乐事业的一切成就。
    因此，黄源洛对党所领导的音乐事业的估计是：“庸俗社会学笼罩着音乐的领空，音乐家的思维被禁锢着”，“在这一种思想支配之下，‘反洋教条’和‘复古主义’者的思想汇流，‘游击战术’和‘庸俗社会学’汇流，产生了一套领导文艺工作的公式”。所以，“领导，真正对业务来说，他是空的没有真正结合实际的思想武器，他只有一枝红樱枪，而且生了锈，这支武器越到上面，就锈的越厉害。一层两层，越是上层，越是跟在后面”。（在海军政治部歌舞团整风小组会上的发言）
    黄源洛是多么仇视“游击战术”和“红樱枪”啊！然而这两个东西却是那么亲切地伴随着中国人民革命斗争的历史。“红樱枪”本身固然是一件比较原始的武器，但当它是在最先进的——共产主义的——战略思想领导下、掌握在广大工农群众手里的时候，这支武器却是不可战胜的。黄源洛不过是假借反对落后的“红樱枪”之名，来攻击党的革命传统，攻击党的群众路线，也就是假借反对“庸俗社会学”之名，来攻击马列主义、攻击共产主义思想。
    历史是不能改写的，新音乐运动的历史证明：只有当音乐家、作曲家接受了共产主义思想和共产党的领导以后，中国的音乐事业才走上了最彻底的民族化、科学化和大众化的道路。我们说聂耳是我国第一个社会主义现实主义的作曲家，从他之后，在党的思想领导下组成了一支越来越强大的音乐的生力军，为中国社会主义音乐事业开辟了道路。在这里，我们丝毫不低估五四以来的、中国具有民主思想的爱国作曲家，如萧友梅、黄自、赵元任等人对中国新音乐事业的贡献，他们的劳绩是五四以来新音乐文化的组成部分。但是，由于他们没有接受共产主义思想的领导，他们虽然写了不少爱国的、具有民主思想的作品，却也写了像“青天白日满地红”（黄自）、像“新生活运动歌”（赵元任）这类维护反动阶级的统治、维护反动的社会秩序的歌曲。他们的创作道路还不是最彻底的民族化、科学化和大众化的。
    党所领导的音乐事业，一开始就是和劳动群众的利益密切联系着的。党是时时刻刻都在注视着、关怀着音乐事业的成长，因此，党在革命的各个时期所提出的方针政策，都使音乐工作有力地向前推进。特别是1942年毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话，鼓舞了音乐工作者更坚定地为工农兵服务，更深入地、认真地向民间学习、向群众学习、努力改造思想，因此，在音乐工作上取得了许多新的成就。
    全国解放以来，党提出了发展科学与文化的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，正是为迎接社会主义文化建设高潮的号召。但黄源洛却有意歪曲和否定党的方针政策的伟大意义，说什么“音乐艺术的花还没有开”，党的政策只是为“未来的盛开准备了先决条件”。黄源洛还异想天开地以为党的政策将会为他的反社会主义的“花”“准备先决条件”呢！“百花齐放”的方针决不会为资产阶级的艺术准备任何条件和“安排园地”的。而社会主义音乐的花朵，从聂耳以后就已经萌芽、包苞、开花、结果了。党的政策鼓舞我们更积极地从事创造性的劳动，为社会主义文化艺术开拓更宽广的园地。历史上没有任何的社会制度能比得上社会主义社会这样彻底地解决艺术和人民的关系，这样正确地继承前人智慧所创造的一切文化成果，这样尊重自己民族的艺术而又同样尊重其它民族的艺术。
    “百花齐放、百家争鸣”是社会主义文化更进一步繁荣的有力保证。
