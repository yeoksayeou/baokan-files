Xinhua News Agency report: Bulganin's letters to Western governments have sparked tremendous reactions in many countries.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi: Indian Prime Minister Nehru indirectly expressed support on December 12 for the Soviet proposal to hold a summit conference of various countries to discuss the current international situation. He said, "New measures should be taken to solve the major problem of world peace. This can only be done through consultation, and I sincerely hope this can become a reality." Nehru spoke at the beginning of a day-long debate on foreign affairs in the Council of States. He welcomed Bulganin's reply to his letter on the issue of stopping nuclear weapons tests and the arms race.

TASS, Ottawa: Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs Smith made a statement on December 11 before the House of Commons Committee on External Affairs on Canada’s relationship with the Soviet Union, stating: "Let us, through every avenue, hold negotiations at any level with the Soviet Union, which will enable us to make a positive contribution to reaching our ultimate goal." Smith then said that we have, in effect, already been “coexisting” with the Soviet Union for forty years. I have no disagreement with the Soviet leaders on the question of peaceful or competitive coexistence, and I would like to add that our goal should be peaceful cooperation so that we can continue negotiations and seek happiness for all mankind.

London: British newspapers have called on Western governments to seriously consider Bulganin's letters to Western governments. The Labor Party's "Daily Herald" published an editorial on December 12 stating, "It would be a sad folly if the West dismissed this Russian step as propaganda." The newspaper concluded: "The West must be prepared to negotiate with Russia. We must step up the work of constructive policy-making."

The "Times" editorial specifically addressed the proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. The newspaper pointed out that there is much evidence recently to prove that such a proposal is supported in the West. The newspaper advocated resolutely utilizing all available means of negotiation and discussion to resolve the various complex and frightening problems that currently threaten peace due to the confrontation between the two major blocs. "The Times" also believes that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should first "unite its ranks" before making such an attempt.

Paris: The French newspaper "l'Humanité" wrote on December 12, commenting on Soviet Premier Bulganin's letter to French Prime Minister Gaillard: "Either support the American plan and consequently become an atomic target destined for certain destruction in the future; or dedicate oneself to easing international tensions and accept the East-West conference proposed by the Soviet Union, thereby restoring the great power status in the world. This is the choice facing our country—a choice between anti-Sovietism and national interests, between the most terrible war and the defense of peace."

Bonn: Bulganin's letter to Adenauer has aroused widespread attention among West German political figures. According to the West German News Agency, West German Foreign Minister Brentano said at a parliamentary group meeting of the Christian Democratic Union-Christian Social Union on December 11 that the Soviet government leader's letter "is correct in its manner and calm in its tone." He also said that efforts must be made to promote the easing of international tensions and to find and carefully study all possibilities suitable for this. West German Social Democratic Party Chairman Ollenhauer said that Bulganin's letter to Adenauer on the eve of the NATO Paris meeting shows that the Soviet government is very concerned about the "important" expansion of atomic armament and the establishment of missile bases in West Germany. West German and West Berlin newspapers also attached great importance to Bulganin's letter to Adenauer. Newspapers and press releases run by the West German government have published the full text of the letter.

Washington: American news agencies, in commenting on Bulganin's letter to Eisenhower, have attempted to give readers the impression that Bulganin's letter is a Soviet "propaganda move." This tone was instructed by the U.S. State Department. U.S. officials are apparently afraid that Bulganin's letter might have a significant impact on American public opinion. According to the Associated Press, U.S. official representatives said in "informal" conversations with American journalists that Bulganin's letter would be "rejected." However, American newspapers also admitted that this was not easy to do. United Press International said, "The Soviet move puts Eisenhower in a difficult position. It faces him with the problem of how to avoid the Soviet proposal, including the proposal for talks, without giving the impression of a direct refusal." Apart from "The New York Times," even the brief summaries of Bulganin's letters were not published by the American bourgeois press.

Democratic Party leader Stevenson said on December 12 that he hoped the U.S. government's response to Bulganin's letter would be "affirmative in spirit." He believes that today's Washington government "lacks imagination and initiative." Stevenson has left for Chicago after ending his twenty-five-day term as a special adviser to the State Department on December 11.

    苏联倡议大国会谈解决重大问题
    许多国家政府和舆论表示重视
    美国国务院指使宣传机关贬低布尔加宁信件的意义
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：布尔加宁给西方各国政府的信件激起许多国家的巨大反应。
    据新华社新德里消息：印度总理尼赫鲁12日间接表示支持苏联提出的举行各国首脑会议讨论目前国际局势的建议。他说：“应该采取新的措施来解决世界和平这个大问题。只有大家一起协商才能做到这一点，我真希望这能成为事实。”尼赫鲁在联邦院就外交问题进行一天的辩论开始时发言。他表示欢迎布尔加宁就停止核武器试验和军备竞赛问题给他的复信。
    据塔斯社渥太华消息：加拿大外交部长史密斯11日在众议院外交委员会就加拿大同苏联之间的关系发表声明说：“让我们通过一切途径同苏联举行任何一级的谈判，这将使我们能对达到我们的最终目的这方面做出积极的贡献。”史密斯接着说，实际上我们同苏联已经“共处”了四十年。在和平的或竞争性的共处问题上我同苏联领导人的意见决没有分歧，我还想进一步说，我们的目标应当是和平合作，以便我们能继续进行谈判，为全人类谋求幸福。
    伦敦消息：英国报纸要求西方国家政府认真考虑布尔加宁给西方各国政府的信件。工党的“每日先驱报”12日发表社论说：“如果西方把俄国这一步骤当作宣传而不予理睬，那将是一种可悲的愚蠢做法。”该报最后指出：“西方必须作好同俄国谈判的准备。我们必须加紧进行建设性的制订政策的工作。”
    “泰晤士报”的社论特别谈到在中欧建立没有核武器地区的主张。该报指出，最近有许多证据可以证明这样一种主张在西方是受人支持的。这家报纸主张坚决要利用能够获得的进行谈判和讨论的一切办法，解决目前形成两大集团对立的局面从而威胁和平的各种复杂而令人害怕的问题。“泰晤士报”同时认为北大西洋公约组织在进行这种尝试前先要“团结自己的队伍”。
    巴黎消息：法国“人道报”12日在评论苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁给法国总理盖伊阿的信件的时候写道：“或者是支持美国计划，因而今后只能成为必定遭受毁灭的原子靶子；或者是致力于缓和国际局势，同时接受苏联所建议的东西方会议，从而在世界上恢复大国地位。这就是我国面临的抉择——在反苏和民族利益之间、在最可怕的战争与保卫和平之间的抉择”。
    波恩消息：布尔加宁给阿登纳的信引起了西德政界人士普遍的重视。据西德通讯社报道，西德外交部长勃伦塔诺11日在基督教民主联盟——基督教社会联盟议会党团会议上说，苏联政府领导人的信“方式是正确的，语气是心平气和的”。他还说，必须努力促进国际紧张局势的缓和、并且找寻和仔细研究一切适宜于这一可能性的办法。西德社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔说，布尔加宁在北大西洋公约组织巴黎会议召开前夕给阿登纳写这封信，说明苏联政府对于“关系重大的”原子军备扩张和在西德境内建立火箭基地一事非常注意。西德和西柏林的报纸也都对布尔加宁给阿登纳的信很重视。西德政府所办的报刊和 新闻公报都登载了这封信的全文。
    华盛顿消息：美国各通讯社在评论布尔加宁给艾森豪威尔的信时，企图给读者这样一种印象：仿佛布尔加宁的信件是苏联的“宣传步骤”。这种语调是美国国务院指示的。美国官方人士显然害怕布尔加宁的信件对美国舆论界可能产生巨大影响。据美联社报道，美国官方代表人物在同美国记者的“非正式”谈话中说，布尔加宁的信将遭到“拒绝”。但是美国报刊也承认这不是容易做到的事。合众社说，“苏联的步骤使艾森豪威尔处境困难。使它面临这样一个问题：怎样避开苏联的建议，其中包括会谈的建议，而又不使人产生直接拒绝的感觉。”美国资产阶级报纸除了“纽约时报”外，甚至都没有登载布尔加宁的信件的简短摘要。
    美国民主党领袖史蒂文森12日说，他希望美国政府对布尔加宁信件的答复“在精神上将是肯定的”。他认为今天的华盛顿政府“缺乏想像力和主动性”。史蒂文森在11日结束了为期二十五天的国务院特别顾问职务后，已动身回芝加哥。
