Territorial Sovereignty and "Freedom of the High Seas"
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

The Indonesian government recently announced that the seas surrounding the Indonesian islands, between the Indonesian islands, and connecting the islands are all part of Indonesia's internal waters or territorial waters, under its absolute sovereignty. This is a significant measure taken by the Indonesian government to preserve its territorial integrity and safeguard its national sovereign interests. Undoubtedly, this action by the Indonesian government will be sympathized with and supported by all peace-loving nations and peoples who respect the territorial integrity of other countries, their sovereign rights, and non-interference in their internal affairs.

However, Dutch Foreign Minister Luns, in a statement on the Indonesian issue on December 23, openly expressed his "unacceptability" of this reasonable measure by the Indonesian government. Luns threatened that the Netherlands would take joint action with the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom to put pressure on the Indonesian government. Prior to this, a British Foreign Office spokesman also stated that the British government believes that the waters between the Indonesian islands are "high seas" and that it cannot "abandon" its "policy of protecting the freedom of the high seas." It is already very clear that colonial countries such as the Netherlands, Britain, the United States, and Australia are trying to collude and use international law terms such as "freedom of the high seas" to undermine the Indonesian government's exercise of national sovereignty.

Indonesia is a country with more than three thousand islands. In the past, the Indonesian government stipulated that the extent of its territorial waters was three nautical miles around each island. As a result, many foreign warships and ships were able to travel unhindered between the Indonesian islands, many foreign groups arbitrarily transported munitions to aid Indonesian insurgents, and engaged in smuggling activities. Furthermore, special agents sent by colonial countries such as the Netherlands often took advantage of this situation to infiltrate Indonesian islands to carry out sabotage. This is a very serious threat to Indonesia's sovereignty and security. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary for the Indonesian government to stipulate that the waters between the islands are a natural part of its territory. The recent dispatch of additional warships to Singapore by the Netherlands, poised to take action, further illustrates this necessity.

Similarly, it is also completely reasonable for Indonesia to extend its territorial waters from three nautical miles to twelve nautical miles beyond the baseline. The British Foreign Office spokesman said, "The usual limit of territorial waters is three miles," which is completely unfounded. According to international law, the extent of a country's territorial waters is determined by the country itself. Recently, the Indian government stipulated that the extent of its territorial waters is six nautical miles from the baseline, which is the latest example. In the past, when Britain detained Napoleon on St. Helena, it expanded the island's maritime jurisdiction to a radius of twenty-four miles, which goes without saying. It can be seen that Britain's claim that the limit of territorial waters is three miles is only a British legal provision, and it cannot be applied to Indonesia at all. Indonesia is a sovereign country, and it has every right to stipulate the extent of its own territorial waters. The incessant complaints of Western colonial countries such as the Netherlands and Britain about Indonesia's stipulations regarding the extent of its territorial waters are nothing more than a crude interference in Indonesia's sovereignty.

The so-called "freedom of the high seas" raised by Western colonial countries such as the Netherlands and Britain is irrelevant to Indonesia's patriotic action of stipulating the extent of its territorial waters. Indonesia has not only not hindered the freedom of the high seas, but it has also stated that foreign ships sailing in Indonesian internal waters will be protected as long as they do not undermine Indonesia's sovereignty and security. On the contrary, it is precisely Western imperialist countries such as the United States and Britain that are hindering the freedom of the high seas. Disregarding the reasonable protests of various countries, they arbitrarily delineate vast waters in the Pacific Ocean as so-called "restricted zones" to conduct nuclear weapons explosions, threatening the peace and security of various countries and harming the interests of the people of various countries.

Obviously, Western colonial countries such as the Netherlands and Britain are interfering in Indonesia's stipulations regarding the extent of its territorial waters with ulterior motives of aggression. They attempt to prevent Indonesia from protecting its own national sovereignty and security, and to continue to allow colonialists to run rampant near the Indonesian islands, carrying out nefarious activities.

    领海主权和“公海自由”
    本报评论员
    印度尼西亚政府最近宣布，围绕印度尼西亚各岛屿的、在印度尼西亚各岛屿之间和联接各岛屿的海面，一律是印度尼西亚绝对主权范围内的内海或领海的一部分。这是印度尼西亚政府为了领土的完整，为了维护印度尼西亚国家主权利益而采取的一项重大措施。毫无疑问，印度尼西亚政府这一行动，一定得到一切爱好和平和尊重别的国家领土主权完整、不干涉别国内政的国家和人民的同情和支持。
    可是，荷兰外交大臣伦斯在12月23日发表的关于印度尼西亚问题的声明中，公然对印度尼西亚政府这个合理措施表示“不能接受”。伦斯扬言，荷兰将要同美国、澳大利亚和英国采取联合行动，对印度尼西亚政府施加压力。在此以前，英国外交部发言人也曾表示：英国政府认为，印度尼西亚各岛屿之间的海面是“公海”，它不能“放弃”“保护公海自由的政策”。事情已经非常明白，荷兰、英国、美国和澳大利亚等殖民国家正在力图勾结起来，利用所谓“公海自由”等国际法名词，来破坏印度尼西亚政府行使国家主权。
    印度尼西亚是一个拥有三千多个岛屿的国家。过去，印度尼西亚政府把领海范围规定为各岛屿周围三海里，结果许多外国军舰和轮船得以在印度尼西亚的各岛屿之间畅行无阻，许多外国集团任意运进军火接济印度尼西亚的叛乱分子，并且进行走私活动，而荷兰等殖民国家派遣的特务分子也往往利用这种情况潜入印度尼西亚各岛屿进行破坏活动。这对于印度尼西亚的主权和安全是很严重的威胁。因此，印度尼西亚政府规定各岛屿之间的水面为它的领域的当然部分，是绝对必要的。最近荷兰增派兵舰到新加坡，蠢蠢欲动，更加说明了这种必要性。
    同样的，印度尼西亚把它的领海范围从三海里扩展到基线以外的十二海里，也是完全合理的。英国外交部发言人说，“领海通常界限是三英里”，这是根本没有根据的。按照国际法，各国的领海范围由各国自行规定。最近，印度政府规定自己的领海范围从基地线伸入海中六海里，就是最新的例子。过去，英国在圣赫勒拿岛拘禁拿破仑的时候，曾把这个岛的海上辖区扩大到周围二十四英里的地方，那就更不用说了。可见，英国提出领海界限为三英里，只是英国的法律规定，它根本不能适用于印度尼西亚。印度尼西亚是一个主权国家，它完全有权规定自己的领海范围。荷兰、英国等西方殖民国家对印度尼西亚规定自己领海范围喋喋不休，只能是对印度尼西亚主权的粗暴的干涉。
    荷兰、英国等西方殖民国家提出的所谓“公海自由”问题，是同印度尼西亚规定领海范围的爱国行动毫不相干的。印度尼西亚不仅没有妨碍公海自由，它并且表示，在印度尼西亚内海上航行的外国轮船，只要它们不破坏印度尼西亚的主权和安全，就将受到保护。正好相反，妨害公海自由的恰恰是美国、英国等西方帝国主义国家，它们不顾各国的合理抗议，任意在太平洋上划定广阔的水域作为所谓“禁区”，进行核武器爆炸，威胁各国和平安全，损害各国人民的利益。
    很明显，荷兰、英国等西方殖民国家干涉印度尼西亚规定自己的领海范围，抱有不可告人的侵略目的。它们企图使印度尼西亚不能保护自己国家的主权和安全，而继续任令殖民者在印度尼西亚各岛屿附近横行霸道，进行罪恶的活动。
