Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 9th: The Third Congress of Rural Youth of the German Democratic Republic was held in Schwerin on the 7th and 8th. The congress adopted a program of action for rural youth, calling on young men and women to actively participate in the socialist construction of the countryside.

    Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, pointed out in his speech at the congress that the rural youth of the German Democratic Republic must participate in the socialist transformation of the countryside. He said that the Free German Youth League must now regard raising the socialist consciousness of young people as its basic task, and must make all farmers understand the superiority of the socialist mode of operation.

    The program of action adopted by the congress pointed out that it is now clear to everyone that socialism has proven its superiority in agriculture. The modern technology provided to farmers by machine tractor stations determines the face of rural life. The doors of all universities and colleges are open to rural youth. Thanks to the worker-peasant alliance, it is possible to carry out large-scale production in the countryside on the basis of voluntary cooperation.

    The program of action called on young men and women in the German Democratic Republic to participate more actively in the socialist construction of the countryside. In accordance with the spirit of the resolution of the 33rd Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the congress called on young members of agricultural production cooperatives, young workers at machine tractor stations, and young agronomists and young breeders to strengthen the socialist elements in agriculture. The program pointed out that it is necessary to increase the harvest of the most important feed crop—maize—which is the main method of increasing livestock production.

    The program also called on German youth to resolutely fight against West German militarism.

　　民主德国农村青年代表大会发出号召
　　农村青年要改造农村
    据新华社9日讯　据塔斯社柏林8日讯：德意志民主共和国农村青年第三届代表大会7日和8日在什未林举行。大会通过农村青年行动纲领，号召男女青年积极地参加农村的社会主义建设。
    德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希在大会上讲话时指出：民主德国的农村青年必须参加农村社会主义改造的事业。他说，自由德国青年联盟现在必须把提高青年的社会主义觉悟当作自己的基本任务，必须使全体农民懂得社会主义经营方式的优越性。
    大会所通过的行动纲领指出：现在大家都很清楚，社会主义已经证明它自己在农业中的优越性。机器拖拉机站向农民提供的现代技术决定着农村生活的面貌。各大专学校的门都为农村青年敞开着。由于有了工农联盟，才有可能在农村中在以自愿原则进行合作化的基础上进行大规模生产。
    行动纲领号召民主德国男女青年更积极地参加农村的社会主义建设。遵照德国统一社会党第三十三次中央全会的决议精神，代表大会号召农业生产合作社的青年社员、机器拖拉机站的青年工作人员和青年农艺师、青年饲养员加强农业中的社会主义成分。纲领指出，必须提高最重要的饲料作物——玉蜀黍的收获量，这是牲畜增产的主要方法。
    纲领还号召德国青年坚决进行反对西德军国主义的斗争。
