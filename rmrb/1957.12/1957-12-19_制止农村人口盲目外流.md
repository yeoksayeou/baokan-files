　　Curb the Blind Outflow of Rural Population
    The blind influx of rural population into cities is detrimental to both cities and rural areas and must be effectively curbed. From last autumn to this summer harvest, according to incomplete statistics from various regions, the number of rural people who blindly flowed into cities reached as high as 570,000; from this autumn to early October, another 110,000 farmers from the four provinces of Shandong, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu blindly flowed into cities. Although local governments have conducted persuasion and repatriation work separately, which has had some effect, this trend has not been completely reversed. Now, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council have issued instructions on curbing the blind outflow of rural population, stipulating strong measures from all aspects to curb the outflow of rural population. Party and government organs and people's organizations in various regions must conscientiously implement these instructions and strive to stop the phenomenon of farmers blindly flowing out in a relatively short period of time.
    Curbing the blind outflow of rural population has great significance in our national life. On the one hand, this will greatly reduce the state's burden on cities. Farmers flowing into cities inevitably increases the city's grain supply and allocation costs, exacerbates the tension in the supply of non-staple foods, and worsens the housing shortage. The purpose of rural people flowing into cities is to find work, but because urban labor employment is planned according to construction needs and is limited, it is difficult to settle this unplanned outflow of population. Some backward elements, especially landlords, rich peasants, and released prisoners who flow into cities, take the opportunity to engage in speculation, gambling, and even theft to maintain their lives, which seriously affects the social order of cities. On the other hand, curbing the blind outflow of rural population also has an important impact on stabilizing rural production order. This autumn, a total of 1,038 male laborers went out from Rangujiqu District in Dingtao County, Shandong Province, accounting for 13.7% of the total labor force in the district. In the fourth production team of the Lvhua Agricultural Cooperative in Changzi County, Shanxi Province, out of a total of 50 male laborers, there was a period when only six production team leaders and group leaders were left. In areas with a large outflow of rural population, there have even been serious phenomena of cultivation plans not being completed and crops not being harvested. If the large outflow of rural population is not curbed, it is obviously greatly detrimental to the rapid development of agricultural production and the strengthening of rural construction, and greatly detrimental to the realization of the Agricultural Development Program.
    The fundamental way to curb the blind outflow of rural population is to strengthen ideological education for the peasant masses. One of the reasons for the blind outflow of rural population is the mistaken belief in rumors that urban employment is easy, envy of urban life, and contempt for and avoidance of agricultural labor. In response to this situation, it must be explained to the peasants that urban employment is not easy. Currently, the number of personnel in government agencies, organizations, factories, and enterprises is not too small, but surplus. Not only is there no need to increase it, but it is already starting to transfer a large number of people to rural areas to increase the strength of the agricultural production front. In the future, if there is a need to recruit personnel, in addition to absorbing them locally in cities, recruiting personnel in rural areas will also be carried out through agricultural cooperatives in a planned manner, and it will not be possible to randomly recruit them. At the same time, peasants should also be educated to be content with agricultural production. Agricultural production has broad prospects. Agriculture occupies an important position in the national economy, and socialist industrial construction needs the strong support of agriculture. Although rural life is still relatively difficult, a prosperous life is the result of hard work. With the development of national economic construction and the hard work of the peasants, rural life is improving and will continue to improve. Under the conditions of rapid development of agricultural production and low rural living expenses in our country, the income level of peasants will soon be able to gradually catch up with the income level of workers. A large number of rural people leaving the countryside will not only not improve rural life, but on the contrary, the reduction in labor will inevitably reduce agricultural income. This is detrimental to both the country and the individual peasants. Therefore, as peasants of New China, as members of agricultural cooperatives, everyone should have such a strong will, that is, to resolutely improve the face of the countryside and build a prosperous and happy new socialist countryside with their own tenacious labor.
    Among the outflowing rural population, some are farmers from disaster-stricken areas. After the disaster, some farmers are unwilling to engage in on-site production for self-salvation and go out to make a living. Local township governments and agricultural cooperatives not only do not dissuade them, but some even write letters of introduction to encourage farmers to go to the cities. It should be pointed out that this practice is very wrong, is a serious dereliction of duty to the country and the disaster victims, and affects the recovery and development of agricultural and sideline production in the disaster areas. Over the years, the state has allocated a large amount of funds to disaster-stricken areas for relief and production. In the future, township governments and agricultural cooperatives in disaster-stricken areas must make full use of this funding to organize disaster victims to overcome famine through production, and should not shirk their responsibilities and condone the outflow of rural population.
    To curb the blind outflow of rural population, it is also necessary to strictly control the employment of urban factories, mines, enterprises, and government units, and strengthen the management of urban household registration. In the past few years, the blind outflow of rural population has increased unabated, which is closely related to the lax employment system and household registration management. Some enterprises and institutions, out of convenience, arbitrarily go to the countryside to recruit workers and arbitrarily employ rural people who flow into the cities. Some households also retain nannies who do not have household registration or only have temporary household registration. These practices not only violate national regulations and stimulate the continued blind outflow of rural population, but also bring adverse consequences to national construction and urban security because they are often mixed with a small number of bad elements. In a few places, some people introduce farmers to participate in temporary work as "contractors" and make profits from it, and new exploiters have emerged in society. Therefore, in the future, all government agencies, enterprises, and individuals must strictly implement the employment system, abide by the urban household registration management methods, and eliminate the above-mentioned phenomena by mobilizing rural people to return to their hometowns.
    The long-term blind outflow of rural population is related to the work of the civil affairs departments, public security departments, and railway departments in many places, in addition to the above-mentioned reasons. Many places turn a blind eye to the phenomenon of blind outflow of rural population and do not intervene; or although they have tried to dissuade them, they are not resolute and forceful enough. In particular, the railway departments have not conducted serious inspections of passengers without tickets or with insufficient tickets; even if passengers without tickets or with insufficient tickets are found, they have not followed the regulations to complete the ticket supplement procedures. This opens the door to blind migrants, allowing them to move freely everywhere without spending fares or spending less fares. The fact that someone in Anhui Province traveled back and forth to the Northeast three times in seven months, with a total travel expense of less than ten yuan, is a clear example. In order to effectively curb the blind outflow of rural population from all aspects, in addition to the railway and shipping departments strengthening the ticket inspection system, all regions should, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, establish dissuasion agencies on some railway lines with a large flow of rural population, transportation hubs at the junction of provinces, and stations and ports, to persuade and repatriate blindly flowing rural population. This is an important measure to curb the inflow of rural population into cities. According to the laws of previous years, winter is a period with a relatively large blind outflow of rural population, so all regions should start this work as soon as possible.
    Curbing the blind outflow of rural population is an important task related to national construction, the worker-peasant alliance, and the normal life of many people. Because this work involves many regions and many departments, all regions should mobilize all relevant departments under the leadership of the Party committee and act immediately in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council. At present, rural production is booming, and state organs at all levels are vigorously streamlining institutions, and leading cadres, staff, intellectuals, family members of workers, and family members of soldiers in cities are going to the countryside and mountains one after another. All of this has created extremely favorable conditions for curbing the blind inflow of rural population into cities. As long as we work patiently and meticulously, fully explain the truth to the masses, and work diligently, the phenomenon of the long-term blind outflow of rural population can be completely curbed.

### 制止农村人口盲目外流

　　制止农村人口盲目外流
    农村人口盲目流入城市，既不利于城市，也不利于农村，必须加以有效地制止。从去年秋后到今年夏收，据各地不完全统计，盲目流入城市的农村人口共达五十七万人之多；从今年秋季到10月上旬，山东、河南、安徽、江苏四省又有十一万农民盲目流入城市。各地政府虽曾分别进行过劝阻和遣送返乡的工作，也起了一些作用，但还没有完全扭转这种趋势。现在，中共中央和国务院发布了关于制止农村人口盲目外流的指示，从各方面规定了制止农村人口外流的有力措施。对这个指示，各地党政机关和人民团体必须认真贯彻执行，争取在较短时间之内使农民盲目外流的现象能够停止。
    制止农村人口盲目外流，在我们国家生活中具有重大意义。一方面，这将会大大减轻国家对城市的负担。农民流入城市，在城市就食就宿，必然增加城市粮食供应量和调拨费用，增加副食品供应紧张局势和住房拥挤的状况。农村人口流入城市的目的是寻找工作，但是，由于城市劳动就业是根据建设需要有计划进行的，而且是有限度的，因此，这种计划外的盲目外流的人口是难以安置的。有些落后分子特别是流入城市的地主、富农以及劳改释放分子等，就乘机进行投机、聚赌以至偷窃来维持生活，严重地影响着城市的社会治安。另一方面，制止农村人口盲目外流，对于稳定农村生产秩序也有重要影响。山东省定陶县冉固集区今年秋季外出的男劳动力共一千零三十八名，占全区劳动力总数的13.7％。山西省长子县绿化农业社第四生产队共有五十名男劳动力，有一个时期走得只剩下六名生产队长和组长。在农村人口大量外流的地区，甚至发生耕作计划不能完成、作物无人收割的严重现象。如果对农村人口大量外流的现象不加以制止，显然是大大不利于迅速发展农业生产和加强农村建设，大大不利于实现农业发展纲要的。
    制止农村人口盲目外流的根本办法，是加强对农民群众的思想教育工作。农村人口盲目外流，原因之一是误信传说，认为城市就业容易，羡慕城市生活，轻视和躲避农业劳动。针对这种情况，必须向农民说明，城市就业并非容易，目前机关团体工矿企业人员不是过少，而是有余，不仅不需要增加，而且已经在开始大量向农村输送，以便增加农业生产战线的力量。今后如果需要招用人员，除在城市就地吸收外，在农村召用人员，也将通过农业社进行有计划地调配，而不可能随便录用。同时还应教育农民，要安心于农业生产。农业生产有着广阔的前途。农业在国民经济中占有重要地位，社会主义工业建设需要农业的大力支援。目前农村生活固然还较艰苦，但是，富裕的生活是艰苦劳动的结果。随着国家经济建设的发展和农民的辛勤劳动，农村生活正在提高并将继续提高。在我国农业生产迅速发展和农村生活费用低廉的条件下，农民收入的水平不要很久就可以逐步赶上工人收入的水平。大批农村人口离开农村，不仅不会改善农村生活，相反，由于劳动力的减少，必然会减低农业收入。这对国家和对农民个人都是不利的。因此，作为新中国的农民，作为农业社社员，每人都应当有这样的坚强意志，这就是用自己的顽强的劳动坚决改善农村面貌，建设社会主义的繁荣幸福的新农村。
    在外流的农村人口中，有一部分是受灾地区的农民。受灾之后，有些农民不愿就地生产自救，而外出谋生，当地乡政府和农业社不仅不予劝阻，有的甚至开写介绍信鼓励农民到城市中去。应该指出，这种作法是非常错误的，是对国家对灾民严重不负责任的表现，而且影响灾区农副业生产的恢复和发展。历年来，对于受灾地区，国家都曾拨出大批款项作为救济和生产之用。今后受灾地区的乡政府和农业社，必须对这项资金加以充分运用，组织灾民生产渡荒，而不应推卸责任，纵容农村人口外流。
    制止农村人口盲目外流，还必须严格控制城市工矿企业和机关单位的用人，加强城市户口的管理。过去几年来，农村人口盲目外流有增无减，同用人制度和户口管理不严有重要关系。有些企业单位，由于贪图方便，任意到农村去招收工人，任意雇用流入城市的农村人口。有些住户也留用没有户口或只有临时户口的保姆。这些作法，不仅违反国家制度，刺激农村人口继续盲目外流，而且由于其中往往混有少数不良分子，给国家建设和城市治安带来不良后果。在少数地方，更有人以“包工头”的身分介绍农民参加临时工作，从中牟利，社会上出现了新的剥削者。因此，今后各机关企业以及个人，必须严格执行用人制度，遵守城市户口管理办法，通过动员农村人口还乡的工作，对上述现象加以清除。
    农村人口长期盲目外流，除上述原因外，还与许多地方的民政部门、公安部门以及铁道等部门的工作有关。对农村人口盲目外流现象，不少地方听之任之，不加过问；或是虽曾进行过劝阻，但也不够坚决有力。特别是铁道部门，对于无票或缺票的乘客，没有进行认真的检查；就是有时查出无票或缺票乘客，也没有按照规章办理补票手续。这就为盲目流动人口打开了方便之门，使他们能够不花路费或是少花路费而自由到处流动。安徽省有人在七个月中往返东北三次，所用路费不足十元，就是一个明显的例证。为了有效地从各方面制止农村人口盲目外流，除铁路、航运部门必须加强验票制度之外，各地应当根据中共中央和国务院指示，在一些农村人口流动较多的铁路沿线、省与省交界的交通要隘以及车站、港口，设立劝阻机构，对盲目流动的农村人口进行劝说和遣送回乡的工作。这是制止农村人口流入城市的一项重要措施。根据历年的规律，冬季是农村人口盲目外流较多的时期，因此，各地应该尽速着手进行这一工作。
    制止农村人口盲目外流，是关系国家建设、关系工农联盟、关系许多人正常生活的一项重要任务。由于这项工作牵涉到许多地区、许多部门，因此，各地应该在党委领导下，动员各有关部门，根据中共中央和国务院的指示，立即行动起来。目前农村生产正在蓬勃发展，而各级国家机关正在大力紧缩机构，城市中的领导干部、工作人员、知识分子、职工家属和军人家属正在纷纷下乡上山，这一切对于制止农村人口盲目流入城市造成了极有利的条件。只要我们耐心地细致地进行工作了，向群众充分说明道理，长期以来农村人口盲目外流的现象是完全能够制止的。
