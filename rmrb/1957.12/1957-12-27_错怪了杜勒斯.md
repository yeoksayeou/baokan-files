Notes

    Wrongly Blaming Dulles
    The failure of the United States at the NATO Paris conference caused mutual complaints within the Washington ruling group. New York Governor Harriman accused Dulles of having to bear "full responsibility" for the fact that Western European countries did not accept the US proposal to establish missile bases in Europe, because Dulles' prior publicity was inadequate and he did not "psychologically prepare the American allies."
    Dulles is being scolded as a fool everywhere, which is certainly his own fault and he deserves it. However, to say that he did not work hard before the Paris conference is a misjudgment.
    The failure of the United States at the Paris conference was precisely because Western European countries were "psychologically prepared" and unwilling to completely entrust their national destiny to the Americans.

    错怪了杜勒斯
    美国在北大西洋集团巴黎会议上遭到失败，在华盛顿统治集团内部引起了互相抱怨。纽约州长哈里曼指责说，杜勒斯必须对西欧各国没有接受美国在欧洲建立导弹基地的建议“负完全责任”，因为杜勒斯在事先宣传不力，没有“让美国盟国在心理上有所准备”。
    杜勒斯到处被人骂为笨蛋，这当然是咎由自取，活该。但是，说他这次在巴黎会议之前没有卖力气，却未免错怪他了。
    美国在巴黎会议上的失败，正是由于西欧国家“在心理上有所准备”，它们不愿意把国家的命运完全交给美国人。
