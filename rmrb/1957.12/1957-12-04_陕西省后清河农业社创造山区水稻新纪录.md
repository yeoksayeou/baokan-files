Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, December 3rd: The Houqinghe Agricultural Cooperative in Yijun County, Shaanxi Province, achieved a yield of 1,654 jin per mu on two mu of rice this year, surpassing the highest mountainous rice record set by the Tingzi Township No. 7 Agricultural Cooperative in Jurong County, Jiangsu Province, by 235 jin.

The Houqinghe Agricultural Cooperative is located in a small gully in the Qiaoshan Mountains of northern Shaanxi, with a cold climate and barren land. Therefore, when selecting seedling fields, the cooperative members specifically chose well-ventilated and sunny locations. During the management of the seedling fields, they also paid attention to flooding the fields at night to prevent the seedlings from freezing and draining the fields at noon on sunny days to increase soil temperature. They also applied large amounts of organic fertilizers such as oil residue and green grass to change the soil and increase its fertility. At the same time, they adopted shallow planting and close planting methods to increase the number of plants per unit area, implemented frequent and shallow irrigation, used water rationally, and promoted strong and fully developed rice seedlings.

Yijun County is one of the low-yield grain areas in Shaanxi Province. With the specific help of the Chengguan Agricultural Technology Station of Yijun County, the Houqinghe Agricultural Cooperative created a thousand-jin rice record last year. This year, the cooperative's forty mu of large-area high-yield rice also reached 1,150 jin per mu. These yields are three to four times higher than the local rice yields.

　　陕西省后清河农业社创造山区水稻新纪录
    新华社延安3日电　陕西宜君县后清河农业社今年有二亩水稻亩产一千六百五十四斤，比江苏省句容县亭子乡第七农业社创造的山区水稻最高纪录，高出了二百三十五斤。
    后清河农业社在陕北乔山山脉的一条小沟道里，气候寒冷，土地瘠薄。因此，社员们在选择秧田时，特别选了通风向阳的地方，在秧田管理过程中，也注意了在晚间放水漫田，防止秧苗受冻，晴天中午落水晒田，提高地温，并大量施用油渣、青草等有机肥料，改变土壤增加地力。同时，采取浅插与小株密植的办法，增加单位面积株数，实行勤浇浅浇，合理用水，促使稻苗发壮熟足。
    宜君县是陕西省粮食低产区之一，后清河农业社在宜君县城关农业技术站的具体帮助下，去年创造了水稻千斤纪录，今年社里的四十亩大面积丰产水稻，亩产也达到一千一百五十斤，这些产量比当地的水稻产量高出三倍到四倍。
