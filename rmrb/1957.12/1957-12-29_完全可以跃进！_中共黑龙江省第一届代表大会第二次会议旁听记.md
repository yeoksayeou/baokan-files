    A Great Leap Forward is Entirely Possible!
    ——Notes from the Sidelines of the Second Session of the First CPC Heilongjiang Provincial Congress——
    By our reporter, Kang Weizhong

    The 400-Jin Target is Entirely Achievable
    At the recently held Second Session of the First CPC Heilongjiang Provincial Congress, delegates fully discussed and studied the province's 1958-1967 Agricultural Development Plan (Draft). According to this ten-year plan, the province's grain yield per unit area and total output will be doubled on the existing basis, that is, the yield per mu will be increased from the current 192 jin to 400 jin, reaching the target set by the National Agricultural Development Program, and the total grain output will be increased from the current 7.85 million tons to 18 million tons. This is an unprecedented Great Leap Forward in the history of agricultural production increase in Heilongjiang Province. From 1949 to 1957, the total grain output of Heilongjiang Province increased by 45%, while the province's agricultural plan (draft) stipulates that from 1958 to 1967, the total grain output of the province will increase by 129%. Compared with the two, the increase rate differs by more than double, and this leap forward speed is inspiring and surprising.

    Two Different Views
    Regarding the target of achieving a yield of 400 jin per unit area within ten years, there were two completely different views. The vast majority of people believe that this indicator is in line with the actual situation of agriculture in the province, and express confidence and certainty in completing the indicator. Some even believe that it can be exceeded. However, a few people with right-leaning conservative ideas deny the possibility of a leap forward in agricultural production and doubt that this target can be achieved. They believe that: it is possible to complete the target for one or two crops (rice, corn), but not for several crops on average; it is possible for small areas (high-yield fields), but not for entire communes, townships, or counties; some even believe that production has reached its peak and there is no more potential to be tapped, and so on. Therefore, at the meeting, combined with studying the reports made by Secretaries Ouyang Qin, Feng Jixin, and Yang Yichen to the conference, and in connection with reality, the method of presenting facts and reasoning was used to focus on criticizing right-leaning conservative ideas, which made those with right-leaning conservative ideas suddenly realize their errors, and also made more people enhance their courage and confidence in completing the agricultural production increase targets. The First Secretary of the AiHui County Party Committee said: "In the past, due to conservative thinking, we lacked enthusiasm and did not have the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains, but instead lowered our heads when encountering high mountains and made way when encountering rivers." Wang Jingyi, a representative from Wangkui County, said: "Our assessment of the shortcomings of the work in 1956 exceeded the achievements, our understanding of the potential of agricultural production in the county was insufficient, and our understanding of 'man can conquer nature' was insufficient, so our thinking was conservative and we were unable to move forward." Wang Chongwen, the Party Secretary of Shengli Township, Zhaoyuan County, said: "These days I have been pondering that next year our township can achieve a yield of 7,000 jin per hectare (6,000 jin per hectare will reach the agricultural increase target), and I feel like there is a flower that has not yet bloomed in my heart." Then the First Secretary of the County Party Committee, Bayan Hu, said: "I didn't think of having a flower in my heart, but I always feel like there is a force that hasn't been exerted. Next year, the county will achieve 5,000 jin per hectare." He also said: "These days I think about it until twelve o'clock at night, and I'm not sleepy when I get up in the morning. I don't know why, but I always feel full of energy." These words of the Secretary of the Zhaoyuan County Party Committee reflect the ideological quality and style of the vast majority of rural cadres who are courageous in overcoming difficulties and full of vigor, and reflect their infinite courage and confidence in realizing the province's agricultural plan.

    Conditions for a Great Leap Forward are Mature
    The objective conditions for achieving a great leap forward in agricultural production are now mature. After the agricultural cooperation in the province, especially after the rural socialist debate, the enthusiasm of farmers in building socialism has been unprecedentedly high, which has already been demonstrated in the province's autumn harvest, threshing, grain purchase (both progressing two to four times faster than last year), and winter production activities this year. Heilongjiang Province is also an emerging important industrial area, and the machinery manufacturing industry is very developed, which can manufacture more and better agricultural machinery and chemical fertilizers to support agriculture. The vast number of rural cadres have also accumulated experience in leading collective production. In particular, after the realization of agricultural cooperation, the focus of the Party's leadership in rural areas has shifted from leading socialist transformation to leading socialist construction. Recently, in accordance with the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, a large number of cadres have been mobilized and organized to go to the countryside and mountains. All of these provide a reliable guarantee for achieving a great leap forward in agriculture.

    As for the rich land resources of Heilongjiang Province, the potential is very large, which can be seen from the imbalance in the growth of yield per unit area between counties, townships, and communes in the province. Taking 1953 as an example, compared with counties, the difference between the highest and lowest average yield per mu was 222 jin. The disparity in yield between townships and communes is even greater. The average yield per mu in Baoshan Township, Suihua County, increased from 155 jin in 1953 to 280 jin in 1957, an increase of 80.5% in five years. The Hongguang Cooperative in Zhaodong increased from 186 jin per mu in 1953 to 397 jin in 1957, an increase of 117% in five years. Some townships and communes, however, have not increased much, or have not increased or even decreased production. Why does this phenomenon occur? According to investigation and research, the main reason is that the high-yield units and regions have carried out farmland water conservancy construction, cultivated more carefully, applied more fertilizer, and used better seeds. Besides, there is no particularly advantageous condition. These examples show that the potential for agricultural production increase in Heilongjiang Province is endless. As long as we are good at exerting the collective strength after cooperation and actively take measures to increase production, it can be fully utilized. In the production upsurge from last winter to this spring, water fields equal to the total development in the past forty years were developed, and the fertilizer application area increased by 20%. Many problems that seemed impossible to solve were solved in a short period of time. This shows that the cooperative system has unlimited power in farmland capital construction and improving land fertility, and this power will be more significantly demonstrated in the future development of agricultural production.

    Of course, achieving the target of 400 jin per mu is not an easy task. Heilongjiang Province has a cold climate, a short frost-free period, and only one harvest per year; at the same time, because it was developed relatively late, there are few people and much land, and the labor force and animal power are insufficient. Under these conditions, we must make efforts in many aspects with the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains. The meeting believes that it is necessary to earnestly solve the following key issues of production increase on the basis of consolidating the agricultural cooperative system and continuing to oppose the spontaneous capitalist forces in rural areas:

      Grasp Several Key Points for Increasing Production
    The first is the issue of water conservancy construction. Heilongjiang Province, on the one hand, has extremely rich water resources, with a total annual flow of about 93.6 billion cubic meters, which can irrigate 6 million hectares of paddy fields. According to the utilization of one-third, it can also irrigate 2 million hectares, which can increase grain production by 4 million tons annually, equal to more than half of the province's total grain output this year. However, only about 4% of the water source is currently utilized. On the other hand, due to insufficient attention to soil and water conservation work, coupled with the large amount of rainfall in recent years, flood disasters are very serious. Three major floods occurred from 1953 to 1957, with a disaster area of 2.02 million hectares, equivalent to 29% of the arable land area this year, and a reduction of 1.78 million tons of grain, equivalent to 22.7% of the total grain output this year. It can be seen that floods are the main disaster in Heilongjiang Province. Therefore, building water conservancy projects to reduce and eliminate flood disasters is the central link in achieving the 400-jin target.

    According to the province's agricultural plan, flood disasters should be basically eliminated within ten years. At present, the planning work for fundamentally controlling the Songhua River is being stepped up, and it is expected that a planning plan can be proposed in 1959 and the fundamental control work can be started. According to estimates by relevant units in Heilongjiang Province, if the two tasks of eliminating waterlogging and reducing soil erosion are done well, the province can increase grain production by more than 1.5 million tons each year, and the amount of grain production will be even greater after the Songhua River is fundamentally controlled.

    More importantly, we must actively utilize water, turn water disasters into water conservancy, turn waterlogged land into paddy fields, and develop the rice industry. Planting paddy fields in Heilongjiang Province is not only experienced by farmers, but also suitable for soil and climate conditions, and the yield is also very high. In general years, the yield per hectare is 6,000 to 7,000 jin. Its output value is more than twice that of dry land. According to the province's agricultural development plan (draft), in the next ten years, the area of paddy fields will be expanded from the current 250,000 hectares to 1 million hectares. In this way, this item alone will increase grain production by 4 million tons each year. Calculated based on the province's existing 7 million hectares of arable land, this measure alone can increase the yield by nearly 100 jin per mu on average.

    The second is the issue of increasing fertilizer application. Judging from the current situation of fertilizer application in the province, the potential in this area is also very large. In the past, farmers in Heilongjiang Province relied on the unique advantages of few people, much land, and fertile soil here, and developed the habit of planting land without applying fertilizer. "Hanging around in the Great Northern Wilderness, you can harvest grain without applying manure" is a true reflection of this situation. Although the Party and the government have called on all localities to accumulate and apply more fertilizer every year, the area and quantity of fertilizer application are still not large in general. According to the investigation and records of the Hejiang Prefecture Agricultural Experiment Station: In the black calcium soil area, applying 400 jin of farm manure per hectare can increase the yield by 20% to 30%; in the gray soil area, applying the same amount of fertilizer can increase the yield by more than 40%. The Lianhe Agricultural Cooperative in Zhaodong County increased grain production by 66% by planting millet with manure compared to millet without manure, and sorghum also increased by 42% under the same conditions. Investigation materials prove that Heilongjiang has abundant fertilizer sources. The province can produce more than 78 million tons of human and animal manure fertilizer each year, but the actual amount currently used is less than half. For this reason, the meeting requested that cooperatives in various places establish a permanent fertilizer accumulation system, stipulate reasonable prices, and mobilize farmers to accumulate fertilizer in every commune, every household, and every person, and utilize all fertilizer sources. It is also necessary to organize farmers to raise pigs in large numbers, and strive to raise one pig per plot of land in the next five years. In addition, it is necessary to fully collect urban fertilizer sources and supply them to rural areas. At the same time, it is necessary to gradually expand the area of chemical fertilizer use according to the industrial supply capacity.

    The third is the issue of reforming cultivation techniques. Intensive cultivation is the experience of increasing production in our country for thousands of years, but many cadres and farmers in Heilongjiang Province do not have this habit and have long relied on "extensive planting and low yield" to eat. Sloppy land preparation, no plowing or harrowing, missing seedlings and broken ridges, lack of attention to seed selection and thinning, only cutting down trees but not afforesting, etc., are the fundamental reasons for the low yield per unit area. After liberation, especially after cooperation, this situation has changed a lot, but cultivation is still very rough. It is necessary to quickly change the rough cultivation situation with revolutionary spirit, adhere to intensive cultivation, more hoeing and plowing, full seedlings and seedling protection, and ensure "three timeliness" and "three meticulousness" in sowing, hoeing, and harvesting to increase grain production.

    Solve the Problem of Insufficient Labor and Animal Power
    In order to do a good job in water conservancy construction, accumulating and applying fertilizer, and intensive cultivation, it is necessary to solve the problem of insufficient manpower and animal power in the province. At present, each labor force in the province bears an average of more than three hectares of arable land, and each animal force bears more than five hectares. According to the requirements of improving agricultural cultivation, each labor force can generally only bear an average of two hectares, and it is not appropriate to exceed three hectares more; each animal force can only bear about 3.5 hectares. In recent years, due to the increase in reclamation area and the development of diversified operations, the shortage of manpower and animal power has become more acute. This is the main reason for the rough cultivation and the slow increase in yield per unit area. In order to solve the problem of insufficient manpower and animal power, the main method at present is to improve the organization of the existing manpower and animal power, so as to achieve rational use and fully exert potential. At the same time, on the one hand, it is necessary to quickly dissuade farmers from blindly flowing into cities, on the other hand, streamline institutions, organize cadres to go to the countryside and mountains, and mobilize middle and primary school graduates who cannot go to school to participate in agricultural production; mobilize urban surplus population and cadres, workers, and staff members whose families are in the countryside to return to their hometowns. It is estimated that as a result of this, each cooperative in the province can increase at least 20 households of labor force. In addition, with planned and appropriate resettlement of some immigrants from other provinces, the shortage of labor force can be alleviated. In terms of animal power, it is necessary to quickly reverse the phenomenon of weak and dying draught animals; train stray horses and cattle to become draft animals; promote the use of old cattle and old horses; and promote the experience of combined use and feeding and group feeding to ensure good feeding. At the same time, it is necessary to vigorously breed draught animals, requiring an increase of more than 480,000 horses in five years, and pay attention to improving animal breeds and improving the quality of draught animals. To completely solve the problem of insufficient manpower and animal power, it is necessary to gradually implement agricultural mechanization. Now, we must immediately start selecting several townships, concentrate a part of the existing agricultural machinery for large-scale mechanized pilot projects, and accumulate experience.

    In the process of realizing a great leap forward in agricultural production, it is urgent to organize the cooperation and coordination of industry, agriculture, commerce, culture, education and other departments, and mobilize forces from all aspects to support agriculture. At present, all relevant departments in the province are following the spirit of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) and considering and formulating their own plans to support agriculture according to the agricultural needs of the province. After the huge support from various aspects is gradually implemented, a new situation will emerge in the province's agricultural production.

    The meeting pointed out that the formulation of agricultural development plans for the province and various regions is only the beginning of building a new socialist countryside. The struggle with nature, in a sense, is more difficult than the struggle with class enemies. Therefore, we must never regard the realization of the ten-year agricultural development plan as an easy task. It is required that Party organizations at all levels strengthen their leadership over agriculture, mobilize the whole Party, and go all out to support agriculture, like supporting industry, and transfer a large number of cadres to support agriculture, mobilize cadres who can be mobilized from organs, schools, and enterprises to go to the countryside and mountains, and go to the forefront of agricultural production to strengthen the agricultural production front. At the same time, it is also required that Party committees at all levels severely improve their work style, resolutely overcome the three major styles, establish a work style of seeking truth from facts and being down-to-earth, conduct in-depth investigation and research, earnestly cultivate typical examples, and be good at summarizing the experience and creation of the masses, and strive to realize the various indicators stipulated in the province's agricultural plan ahead of schedule.

    完全可以跃进！

    四百斤指标完全可以实现
    在最近举行的中共黑龙江省第一届代表大会第二次会议上，代表们充分地讨论和研究了全省1958年——1967年农业发展规划（草案）。根据这个十年规划，全省的粮食单位面积产量和总产量要在现有基础上翻一翻，即单位面积亩产量由今年的一百九十二斤提高到四百斤，达到全国农业发展纲要所规定的指标，粮食的总产量由现在的七百八十五万吨提高到一千八百万吨。这是黑龙江省农业增产史上空前未有的大跃进。从1949年到1957年这八年中，黑龙江省粮食总产量增加了45％，而全省农业规划（草案）规定的1958年到1967年这十年中，全省粮食总产量增加129％。两者相比，增产幅度相差一倍多，这种跃进的速度是令人振奋和惊异的。
    两种不同的看法
    对于在十年内实现单位面积产量四百斤的指标，曾有着两种迥然不同的看法。绝大多数人认为这个指标是符合全省农业的实际情况的，对完成指标表示有信心有把握，有的还认为可以争取超过。但是，也有少数有右倾保守思想的人，否认农业生产有跃进的可能性，怀疑这个指标能完成。他们认为：一两项作物（稻子、玉米）完成指标行，几种作物平均起来不行；小块面积（丰产田）行，整社、整乡、整县不行；个别的甚至认为生产已经到顶，再无潜力可挖等等。因此，在会上结合学习欧阳钦、冯纪新和杨易辰书记给大会作的报告，连系实际，用摆事实讲道理的方法，集中地批判了右倾保守思想，使有右倾保守思想的人猛省过来，同时也使更多的人增强了完成农业增产指标的勇气和信心。爱辉县委第一书记说：“过去因为有保守思想，干劲不足，没有愚公移山的精神，而是遇高山低头，遇河水让路。”望奎县代表王景义说：“我们对1956年工作缺点的估计超过了成绩，对全县的农业生产潜力认识不足，对‘人定胜天’认识不足，因此思想保守，举步不前。”肇源县胜利乡党委书记王崇文说：“这几天我琢磨着明年我们全乡每公顷产量可达到七千斤（每公顷六千斤就达到农业增产指标），心里总像有朵花没有开似的。”接着县委第一书记巴彦胡说：“我心里倒没有想到有朵花，但总觉得有股劲没有使出来。明年全县要来个每公顷五千斤。”他并且说：“这几天夜间想到十二点，早晨起来还不困，不知怎么的，总像满身是劲。”肇源县委书记这番话，正反映了绝大多数农村干部那种勇于克服困难、朝气勃勃的思想品质和作风，反映了他们对实现全省农业规划的无限勇气和信心。
    大跃进条件已成熟
    就目前实现农业生产大跃进的客观条件来说也已经成熟。全省农业合作化以后，特别是经过农村社会主义大辩论，农民建设社会主义的积极性空前高涨，这已经从全省今年秋收打场、征购粮食（两者比去年进度加快二至四倍）和冬季生产活动的事例中表现出来。黑龙江省又是一个新兴的重要工业地区，机械制造工业很发达，可以制造更多更好的农业机械和化学肥料支援农业。广大农村干部也积累了领导集体生产的经验。特别是实现农业合作化以后，党在农村的领导重心已由领导社会主义改造转入领导社会主义建设方面来，最近又根据三中全会精神，动员组织大批干部下乡，上山。所有这些，都为实现农业大跃进提供了可靠的保证。
    就黑龙江省丰富的土地资源来说，蕴藏的潜力很大，这可以从全省县与县、乡与乡、社与社之间单位面积产量增长的不平衡的情况看出来。以1953年为例，县与县相较，每亩平均产量最高和最低的相差二百二十二斤。乡和乡、社与社之间，产量的悬殊更大。绥化县宝山乡全乡平均亩产由1953年的一百五十五斤增加到1957年的二百八十斤，五年中增长80.5％。肇东红光合作社由1953年的亩产一百八十六斤提高到1957年的三百九十七斤，五年中增长了117％。而一些乡社则增产不多，或没有增产甚至减了产。为什么会出现这种现象呢？根据调查研究，主要原因是高产的单位和地区进行了农田水利建设，耕作较细，上粪较多，种籽较好，此外，并没有得天独厚的地方。这些事例说明，黑龙江省农业增产潜力无穷无尽，只要我们善于发挥合作化以后的集体力量，积极采取增产措施，就可以使它充分发挥出来。前冬去春的生产高潮中，发展了等于四十年来发展总和的水田，施肥面积增加了20％，许多看来无法解决的问题在短短的时间内得到了解决。这表明合作化制度在农田基本建设、提高地力方面有无限的威力，这种威力在今后的农业生产发展中将表现得更加显著。
    实现亩产四百斤的指标，当然也并不是轻而易举的事。黑龙江省气候寒冷，无霜期短，一年只有一季收成；同时因为开发较晚，人少地多，劳力畜力不足。在这种条件下，必须以愚公移山的精神，进行多方面的努力。会议认为：必须在巩固农业合作化制度，继续反对农村中资本主义自发势力的基础上，认真解决以下增产关键问题：
      抓住几个增产关键
    一是水利建设问题。黑龙江省一方面水利资源极为丰富，年总流量约为九百三十六亿公方，可灌溉水田六百万公顷，按利用三分之一计算，亦可灌溉二百万公顷，每年可增产四百万吨粮食，等于今年全省粮食总产量一半以上。可是现在只利用了水源的4％左右。另一方面，由于对水土保持工作重视不够，加上近几年降雨量较大，洪涝灾害非常严重。1953年到1957年中间就发生了三次大的水灾，受灾面积二百零二万公顷，等于今年耕地面积29％，减产粮食一百七十八万吨，等于今年粮食总产量的22.7％。可见水患是黑龙江省的主要灾害。因此，兴修水利，减少和消除洪涝灾害是实现四百斤指标的中心环节。
    根据全省农业规划，要在十年内基本上消灭洪涝灾害。目前，根治松花江的规划工作正在加紧进行，预计在1959年可提出规划方案，开始进行根治工作。根据黑龙江省有关单位估计：如果作好消除内涝和减少水土流失两项工作，每年全省就可以增产粮食一百五十万吨以上，根治好松花江之后，粮食增产的数量就更多了。
    更重要的是要从积极方面去利用水，变水害为水利，变涝地为稻田，发展水稻事业。在黑龙江省种植稻田，不仅农民有经验，土质和气候条件也适宜，而且产量也很高，一般年景，每公顷产六、七千斤。它的产值相当于旱田的两倍多。根据全省农业发展规划（草案），在今后十年内，稻田面积要由目前的二十五万公顷扩大到一百万公顷。这样，每年仅这一项就增产粮食四百万吨，按全省现有耕地七百万公顷计算，光这一项措施，平均每亩就可提高产量将近一百市斤。
    二是增施肥料问题。从目前全省土地施肥情况看，这方面的潜力也是很大的。过去，黑龙江省的农民凭借着这里人少、地多、土质肥的得天独厚的优越条件，养成了种地不施肥的习惯。“吊儿浪当北大荒，不上粪也打粮”，正是这种情况的写照。党和政府虽然年年号召各地多积肥多上肥，但是从总的方面来说，施肥面积和数量仍然不算多。据合江专区农业试验站调查记载：在黑钙土地区，每公顷施农家肥料四百斤，可提高产量20％到30％；在灰化土区，施同样肥料，提高产量达40％以上。肇东县的联合农业合作社，施大粪种植的谷子比不施粪的增产粮食66％，高粱在同样情况下也增产42％。调查材料证明，黑龙江肥源是丰富的。全省每年可产人、畜粪肥总数在七千八百万吨以上，而目前实际利用的数量尚不足半数。为此，会议要求各地合作社要建立常年的积肥制度，规定合理代价，发动农民社社积肥，户户积肥，人人积肥，把一切肥源都利用起来。还要组织农民大量养猪，在近五年内作到一埫地养一口猪。此外，要充分搜集城镇肥源，供应农村。同时，要根据工业供应能力，逐步扩大化学肥料的使用地区。
    三是改革耕作技术问题。精耕细作是我国几千年来的增产经验，但黑龙江省许多干部和农民还没有这种习惯，长期地靠“广种薄收”吃饭。整地不细致，不翻不耙，缺苗断垅，不重视选种、间苗，只砍树不造林等等，这是单位面积产量不高的根本原因。在解放以后，特别是合作化以后，这种情况已有了不小的改变，但耕作仍很粗糙。必须以革命气魄迅速改变耕作粗放的状况，坚持精耕细作，多铲多趟，全苗保苗，保证播种、铲趟、收割“三适时”“三细致”，以增加粮食产量。
    解决劳畜力不足的问题
    为了作好兴修水利、积肥施肥、精耕细作，必须解决全省人力、畜力不足的问题。目前，全省平均每一个劳动力负担耕地面积三公顷以上，每一畜力负担五公顷以上。根据改进农业耕作的要求，每一劳动力一般地只能平均负担二公顷，多一些也不宜超过三公顷；每一畜力只能负担三点五公顷左右。几年来，由于垦荒面积增加和多种经营的发展，人力、畜力更感不足。这是耕作粗放和单位面积产量提高不快的主要原因。为了解决人、畜力不足的问题，目前主要的办法是改进现有人、畜力的组织，做到合理使用，充分发挥潜力。同时，一方面必须迅速劝阻农民盲目流入城市，一方面精简机构、组织干部下乡上山，并发动不能升学的中、小学毕业生参加农业生产；把城市闲余人口和家在农村的干部职工家属动员回乡。估计这样作的结果，全省每个合作社至少可增加二十户的劳动力，再加上有计划地、适当地安置一些外省移民，劳动力不足的情况可以有所缓和。在畜力上必须迅速扭转耕畜瘦弱、死亡的现象；训练散马、散牛变为役畜；提倡使用老牛老马；推行使用、喂养合一和分组喂养的经验，保证使好、喂好。同时要大力繁殖耕畜，五年内要求增加马四十八万多匹，并注意改良畜种，提高耕畜质量。要彻底解决人畜力不足的问题，必须逐步实行农业机械化。现在要立即着手选择若干乡，集中一部分现有的农业机器进行大面积机械化的试点，积累经验。
    在实现农业生产大跃进的过程中，迫切需要组织工、农、商、文教等部门的协作配合，动员各方面的力量支援农业。目前全省各有关部门正在遵循全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）精神，根据本省农业需要，考虑和制订各自支援农业的规划。各方面的巨大支援逐步实施之后，全省农业生产将出现崭新的局面。
    会议指出：全省和各地农业发展规划的拟订，仅仅是建设社会主义新农村的开始。和自然作斗争，在某种意义上讲，比和阶级敌人作斗争要更加艰巨一些。因此决不能把十年农业发展规划的实现，视为轻而易举的事情。要求各级党组织加强对农业的领导，全党动员，全力以赴，像支援工业那样，抽调大批干部去支援农业，动员机关、学校、企业中能够动员出来的干部下乡上山，到农业生产最前线去，加强农业生产战线。同时还要求各级党委狠狠地改进工作作风，坚决地克服三大主义，树立实事求是、脚踏实地的工作作风，深入调查研究，认真培养典型，善于总结群众的经验和创造，为提前实现全省农业规划规定的各项指标而努力。
