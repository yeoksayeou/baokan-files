　　Congratulations on the Publication of the Draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme
　　Tang Lan
    The draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme has been approved by the State Council at its plenary session and published in the newspapers. The formulation and implementation of this scheme will undoubtedly provide favorable conditions for our country to build a new socialist culture. Using the phonetic alphabet scheme to annotate Chinese characters will not only enable hundreds of millions of illiterate people to quickly recognize characters and improve their cultural level, but also unify the pronunciation of characters, laying the foundation for the promotion of Mandarin. Ethnic minorities can use this scheme to develop their own scripts, and it will be more convenient for them to learn Chinese.
    The new scheme uses only twenty-six extremely common Latin letters, which is much more convenient than using special phonetic symbols and mixing Russian letters in the original draft. “V” is generally not used, so there are actually only twenty-five letters, which is much simpler than using thirty-seven phonetic symbols in the past.
    Because some scholars in the past confused the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme with the abolition of Chinese characters, many people doubted or even opposed the original draft. I personally advocate the direct romanization of Chinese characters in the fundamental reform of Chinese characters, but I think it is also possible to carry out reforms using Latin letters in parallel. Now, the explanation of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme draft by the Chinese Writing Reform Committee first points out that the current task of writing reform is to formulate and implement the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, which is only to help teach Chinese characters, unify pronunciation, and promote Mandarin, and should not be confused with the fundamental reform of Chinese characters. This can dispel unnecessary concerns among the general public and will be more conducive to the implementation of this scheme.
    At present, the conditions for fundamentally reforming Chinese characters are not yet in place, and the widespread elimination of illiteracy and the promotion of Mandarin are the main tasks at present. Any phonetic alphabet scheme that can accomplish this task will be welcomed by the masses of the people. This new draft has been researched and discussed for a long time and reflects the opinions of the majority of those who participated in the discussion, so it must be easy to implement.
    However, with the emergence of a new thing, the masses of the people will definitely have all kinds of views. Some people will find it convenient, and some people will definitely find it inconvenient. We should mainly consider the interests of the majority of people. If everyone finds it convenient, then even if there are some inconveniences for oneself, one should try to overcome them. The phonetic alphabet is a tool that contains various spellings. For illiterate people, it is easier to learn from scratch, but for people who have learned Chinese characters or other phonetic methods, it is somewhat difficult to learn this new tool. Of course, the difficulty is not too great. If there is no ideological resistance and one is not too lazy to learn, this difficulty is easily overcome. Although I am personally unfamiliar with this new tool, I must learn it and I am confident that I can learn how to master and use this new tool well.
    I believe that Chinese characters should be fundamentally reformed and should be reformed into a phonetic script. Different opinions on this issue can be discussed at leisure in the future. Today, the publication of the draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is a major step forward in the process of Chinese writing reform. The implementation of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme will create conditions for the fundamental reform of Chinese characters. In the process of practice, this scheme will gradually be improved, and experience can also be drawn from it. In short, this is beneficial to the fundamental reform of Chinese characters. I advocate the national form of writing, but the national form is not only in the form of the letters. Some Soviet publications often write Latin letters in the form of Chinese characters. The phonetic symbol “ㄩ” is not much different from the new scheme’s “U”, and “ㄧ” is even no different from “I”. If you like the Chinese character form, it is not impossible to write Latin letters as if they were Chinese characters. Therefore, I think we should not only focus on the form of the letters, but should look at whether the whole scheme is convenient for learning and application. The new scheme can do this, which is what makes it far superior to other schemes in the past.
    The publication of the draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is a great happy event under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and on the basis of the victory of the anti-Rightist struggle. When the Zhang-Luo alliance rampantly attacked the Party, they wanted to use the issue of writing reform as a smokescreen. The rightist element Chen Mengjia was even setting fires everywhere, provoking the relationship between the Party and the masses, and doing his utmost to incite. However, facts are always facts, and the Party's policy has never been divorced from the masses. Taking the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme as an example, it has also undergone a long period of mass discussion. There were divergent and complex opinions in the discussion, and finally a consensus was reached, which made the new scheme relatively perfect. Through the publication of this scheme, we can also appreciate the greatness and correctness of the Party. In our country with more than 600 million people, illiterates still account for 70 to 80 percent. The formulation and implementation of this scheme will help improve the cultural level of the entire nation and enable our country to build socialism more quickly. The State Council's resolution was published in the newspaper to let the people of the whole country know in advance and allow the people to express their opinions so that they can be fully prepared when submitting it to the National People's Congress for discussion. I fully support this serious and prudent measure. From the standpoint of hundreds of millions of illiterate people who need to rapidly improve their culture, I congratulate the publication of this scheme draft and wish it a smooth approval by all the people's representatives at the National People's Congress.

　　祝贺汉语拼音方案草案的公布
　　唐兰
    汉语拼音方案草案已经由国务院全体会议通过，并且登报公布。这个方案的制定和推行，毫无疑问地将使我国建设社会主义的新文化取得良好的条件。用拼音方案来为汉字注音，既能使几亿文盲迅速地认识文字，提高文化；又可以统一文字的读音，为推广普通话奠定基础。少数民族可以利用这个方案来制定自己的文字，并且在学习汉语时将更为便利。
    新的方案只用极为通用的拉丁字母二十六个，比原草案里用特殊的音标符号，和夹用俄文字母等，方便多了。“V”一般是不用的，实际上只有二十五个字母，比过去用三十七个注音字母也简单多了。
    由于过去有些学者们把汉语拼音方案和废除汉字混淆起来，所以很多人对原草案怀疑，甚至于反对。我个人在汉字的根本改革问题上是主张由汉字直接拼音化的，但是我认为用拉丁字母来进行改革，也不妨并行。现在，中国文字改革委员会关于汉语拼音方案草案的说明，首先指出当前文字改革的任务，制定和推行汉语拼音方案，只是帮助教学汉字、统一读音和推广普通话，不应该与汉字的根本改革问题混淆起来。这样可以消释一般群众的不必要的疑虑，将更有利于这个方案的推行。
    在目前，根本改革汉字的条件还未具备，而普遍地扫除文盲，推广普通话是当前的主要任务，任何能完成这个任务的拼音方案，都会被人民群众所欢迎。这个新草案经过长期的研究和讨论，反映了参加讨论的大多数人的意见，因而它一定是容易推行的。
    但是，一件新事物的出现，人民群众一定会有各式各样的看法，有人觉得方便，也一定有人会觉得不方便。我们主要应为大多数人的利益着想，如果大家都觉得方便，那末，对于自己尽管有一些不方便，就应该设法克服。拼音字母是一种工具，包含着各种拼法，对文盲来说，从头学起是比较容易的，但学过汉字的人，或者学过其他拼音方法的人要改学这种新的工具，是有一些困难的。当然，困难并不太大，如果不是思想有抵触，懒得去学，这一点困难是很容易克服的。我个人尽管对这个新工具很生疏，但是我一定要学会而且有信心能学好如何掌握并使用这个新的工具。
    我认为中国文字应该进行根本改革，应该改革为拼音文字，关于这个问题的不同意见，以后还可以从容讨论。今天，汉语拼音方案草案的公布是中国文字改革前进过程中的一大步；推行了汉语拼音方案，将为中国文字的根本改革创造条件；在实践过程中，这个方案将更逐渐完善，也可以从中吸取经验；总之，这对于根本改革中国文字是有利的。我主张文字的民族形式，但民族形式不仅仅在字母的形式上面，苏联的有些刊物上往往把拉丁字母写成汉字形式，注音字母的“ㄩ”，跟新方案的“U”，相去是无几的，“ㄧ”跟“I”，更没有什么不同，如果喜欢汉字形式，也未尝不可用拉丁字母写得跟汉字仿佛。所以，我认为不应该只着眼于字母的形式问题，而应该看整个方案的是否便利于学习和应用。新方案能做到这一点，这是它远胜过去其它方案的地方。
    汉语拼音方案草案的公布是在中国共产党的领导下，在反右派斗争胜利的基础上的一件大喜事。当章罗联盟猖狂向党进攻时，他们是想借文字改革问题来作烟幕的。右派分子陈梦家更是到处放火，挑拨党和群众的关系，极其煽动的能事。但是，事实总是事实，党的政策从来没有脱离过群众，就以汉语拼音方案来说，也是经过长期群众讨论的。在讨论中有过分歧复杂的意见，最后才获得一致，这就使得新方案能够比较完善。我们通过这个方案的公布，也可以体会到党的伟大和正确。在我国六亿多人民中，文盲还占百分之七八十，这个方案的制定和推行，将有助于提高全民的文化水平，使我国更快地建成社会主义。国务院决议登报公布，让全国人民事先知道，让人民都可以表示意见，以备提请全国人民代表大会讨论时有充分的准备，我完全拥护这个严肃慎重的措施。我从几亿文盲需要迅速提高文化的立场上，祝贺这个方案草案的公布，并预祝它将在全国人民代表大会上顺利地获得全体人民代表们的批准。
