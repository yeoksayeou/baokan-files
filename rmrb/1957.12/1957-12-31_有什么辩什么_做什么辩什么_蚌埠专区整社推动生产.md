Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: In Bengbu Special District, Anhui Province, over 700 agricultural cooperatives are universally using the methods of "argue about what you have" and "debate what you do" to carry out commune rectification, which has not only rectified the communes well but also promoted current production. The Dongfanghong Second Cooperative and the Xianfeng Cooperative in Xiao County were originally both Class III cooperatives. There were many problems in production management, financial management, and cadre work style. Therefore, at the beginning of large-scale water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation, the cooperative members were not very active. During the blooming and contending period, the cooperative members put forward many sharp criticisms and constructive opinions on these problems. After the cooperative improved its work vigorously based on the opinions of the masses, the production enthusiasm of the cooperative members generally increased. More than 90% of the labor force was invested in winter production. Now, these two cooperatives have completed the tasks of winter and spring water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation ahead of schedule and exceeded their targets. When repairing water conservancy facilities in the Wa Wu Agricultural Cooperative, Suchang Township, Su County, some cooperative members said, "We repair every year, and we are flooded every year," and they were not active in this year's water conservancy project. Some demanded that sideline production be the main focus in winter to "gain immediate benefits." Some proposed "the state pays the money, and we provide the manpower." In response to these ideological obstacles, the agricultural cooperative organized its members to study the National Agricultural Development Program and debate issues such as "Do we need to carry out large-scale water conservancy this year? Have there been achievements in previous repairs?", "Should winter production focus on water conservancy or sideline production?", and "Who should we rely on for the repairs?". In the debate, some said, "Last year's flood was very large, but as a result, we harvested tens of thousands of catties more grain, which is the achievement of water conservancy." Some said, "If the Party had not led us to build the Lao Wanghu Dam and open dozens of large and small ditches, more than 3,000 mu of land in the lake would not have been able to harvest grain at all." Everyone affirmed that large-scale water conservancy projects must be carried out this year, and they criticized the erroneous idea that sideline production should be the main focus in winter. When debating "who to rely on for repairs," everyone criticized the dependent thinking of reaching out to the state for money. After the debate, the cooperative members enthusiastically invested in the water conservancy movement, all saying, "Dig one more cubic meter of soil this year, harvest one more dou of grain next year, march towards nature, and demand grain from the low-lying areas." Many agricultural cooperatives have also promoted sideline production through rectification and debate. The agricultural cooperatives in Hao Township, Wuhe County, through debate and sorting in the rectification, found many avenues for sideline production such as brick kilns, flour milling, tofu grinding, and weaving. They have drawn up a plan for sideline production for this winter and next spring, which is expected to generate profits of 125,000 yuan for the whole year. Specialists have now been assigned to lead sideline production.

    In order to ensure that production and rectification are not delayed, agricultural cooperatives in various places have also adopted various forms of blooming, contending, and debate, allowing cooperative members to "do a good job when there is work, finish what they have to say," "speak wherever they go, and express all opinions thoroughly." The Matou Agricultural Cooperative in Huaiyuan County launched a blooming campaign during rest periods on the water conservancy construction site, putting forward more than 100 opinions in one day. Cadres who went to the construction site with the migrant workers also set up two writing stations to record the opinions of the cooperative members, which was very popular. Cooperative members engaged in fertilizer accumulation also used their spare time to hold symposiums and engage in large-scale blooming and contending.

### 有什么辩什么　做什么辩什么  蚌埠专区整社推动生产

    有什么辩什么　做什么辩什么
    蚌埠专区整社推动生产
    新华社专讯　安徽省蚌埠专区有七百多个农业社普遍运用“有什么辩什么”、“做什么辩什么”的办法进行整社，既整好了社，又推动了当前生产。萧县东方红二社和先锋社原来都是三类社，在生产管理、财务管理和干部作风等方面都存在不少问题，因此在大兴水利、积肥的开始，社员不很积极。鸣放中，社员们对这些问题提出不少尖锐的批评和建设性的意见，社里根据群众意见狠狠改进了工作以后，社员的生产积极性普遍提高，90％以上的劳动力投入了冬季生产，现在这两个社已经提前超额完成了今冬明春兴修水利和积肥的任务。宿县突町乡瓦屋农业社在兴修水利时，社员们有的说：“年年兴修，年年受淹”，对今年兴修水利不积极；有的要求冬季以搞副业为主，可以“马上得利”；有的提出“国家出钱，我们出人”。针对这些思想障碍，农业社组织社员一面学习全国农业发展纲要，一面辩论“今年要不要大兴水利，以前兴修有没有成绩”、“冬季生产以兴修水利为主，还是以搞副业为主”、“依靠谁来兴修”等问题。在辩论中，有的说：“去年水灾很大，但结果还多收了几万斤粮，这就是兴修水利的成绩”，有的说，“不是党领导我们筑好老汪湖大堤，开了大小几十条沟，湖内三千多亩地就根本不能收粮食”。大家肯定今年要大兴修水利，并且批判了冬季生产以副业为主的错误思想，在辩论“依靠谁来兴修”的时候，大家批判了那种向国家伸手要钱的依赖思想，经过辩论以后，社员们热情地投入兴修水利运动，都说“今年多挖一方土，明年多收一斗粮，向自然进军，向洼地要粮”。不少农业社还通过了整社辩论，带动了副业生产。五河县濠城乡各个农业社在整社中通过辩论排队，找出了烧窑、磨粉、磨豆腐、编织等多种副业生产门路，订出了今冬明春副业生产计划，预计全年可获利十二万五千元，现已指定专人领导副业生产。
    为了使生产、整社两不误，各地农业社还采用多种形式鸣放、辩论，让社员们做到“有活干好，有话说完”、“人到那里那里鸣、所有意见都提净”。怀远县码头农业社在兴修水利的工地上利用休息时间展开鸣放，一天提出一百多条意见。随民工到工地上的干部，还设立两个代笔站，代社员记录意见，很受欢迎。搞积肥生产的社员，也利用工余时间开座谈会大鸣大放。
