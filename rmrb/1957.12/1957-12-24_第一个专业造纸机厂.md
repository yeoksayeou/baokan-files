    The First Specialized Paper Machine Factory
    China's first relatively standardized, specialized large-scale paper machine factory, the Shanghai Paper Machinery Factory, broke ground and began construction on the 18th in the Pengpu New Industrial Area.
    The predecessor of the Shanghai Paper Machinery Factory was the original Zhonghua Iron Factory, which in the past could only undertake the construction of small-scale cylinder or Fourdrinier multi-cylinder paper machines. Only after liberation did it begin to manufacture paper machines with a daily paper production capacity of five, ten, and eighteen tons. After the expansion of this factory is completed, the main products will be paper machines with a daily paper production capacity of fifty and one hundred tons. This factory is expected to be completed and put into production in the fourth quarter of next year.

    第一个专业造纸机厂
    我国第一个比较正规的专业大型造纸机厂——上海造纸机械厂，18日在彭浦新工业区破土开工兴建。
    上海造纸机械厂的前身，就是原来的中华铁工厂，过去只能承造小型圆网或长网多烘缸造纸机，解放后，才开始制造日产纸量五吨、十吨、十八吨的造纸机。这个厂扩建完成以后，主要产品将是日产纸五十吨和一百吨的造纸机。这个厂预计在明年第四季度建成并投入生产。
