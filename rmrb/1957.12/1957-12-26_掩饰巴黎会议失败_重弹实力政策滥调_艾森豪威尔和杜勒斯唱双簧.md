Xinhua News Agency, December 24th dispatch: Washington News: U.S. President Eisenhower and Secretary of State Dulles delivered a broadcast address to the nation on the evening of the 23rd, discussing the results of the NATO Paris meeting and asking the American people to make "many sacrifices" to intensify the nuclear arms race. Apparently considering the enormous influence of a series of Soviet peace initiatives around the world, Eisenhower had to repeatedly express in his speech his "hope to improve understanding between East and West."

　　Eisenhower insisted at the beginning of his speech that the main purpose of the NATO meeting was to strive for a "just peace" and that the United States was "always ready" to take any measures to ease international tensions. Dulles also stated that Western countries should be committed to reaching agreements with the East on major disputes to promote the easing of international tensions.

　　But Eisenhower also said that the "most effective" means of preventing war is for the West to have adequate strength. Dulles said that the United States believes that lasting peace will not be achieved if the West is "weak and disunited." This shows that the U.S. government still intends to implement the bankrupt "position of strength" policy.

　　Eisenhower and Dulles avoided answering many important Soviet initiatives and continued to slander the Soviet Union, as if the main obstacle to easing international tensions was Soviet policy, not American policy. Dulles rejected in his speech the Soviet proposal to convene a UN General Assembly to specifically discuss disarmament issues.

　　Eisenhower and Dulles attempted to create the impression that the NATO Paris meeting was a success. In order to cover up the fact that the United States did not achieve its intended goals at the Paris meeting, Dulles heavily touted the meeting's military "achievements." He described the barely reached "in principle" agreement on the United States providing missiles to Europe as the "most notable decision."

　　Dulles also spoke of hoping to strengthen the West's scientific equipment and intelligence gathering for military scientific research, and that NATO now hopes to explore the possibility of establishing ties with the Organization of American States, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the Baghdad Pact Organization.

　　Although Dulles tried his best in his speech to avoid talking about the deep contradictions within the NATO group reflected in the Paris meeting and the serious difficulties the United States faces in realizing its agenda, he also admitted that "differences and dissatisfactions inevitably arise from time to time among free nations, no matter how arduous or skillful efforts we make." He urged Western countries to "interdepend" and "unite." He said that realizing the decisions of the Paris meeting will require "lasting effort and sacrifice."

    掩饰巴黎会议失败　重弹实力政策滥调
    艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯唱双簧
    据新华社24日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔和国务卿杜勒斯23日晚上向全国发表广播谈话，谈论北大西洋公约组织巴黎会议的结果，要求美国人民为加紧核军备竞赛作出“很多的牺牲”。显然是考虑到苏联一系列和平倡议在全世界产生的巨大影响，艾森豪威尔在谈话中不得不一再表示“希望改善东西方之间的谅解”。
    艾森豪威尔在演说开始时硬说，北大西洋公约组织会议的主要目的是力求达到“正义的和平”，美国“随时准备”采取任何措施，以便缓和国际紧张局势。杜勒斯也表示西方国家要致力于使东西方之间就主要的争端达成协议，来促使国际紧张局势的缓和。
    但是艾森豪威尔同时又说，防止战争的“最有效”的手段是西方拥有适当的实力。杜勒斯说，美国认为，如果西方“软弱和涣散”的话，就不会达到持久和平。这就表明了，美国政府仍然打算执行已经破产了的“实力地位”政策。
    艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯避而不答苏联的许多重要倡议，而继续对苏联进行诽谤。仿佛缓和国际紧张局势的主要障碍是苏联的政策，不是美国的政策。杜勒斯在谈话中拒绝了苏联提出的召开联合国大会来专门讨论裁军问题的建议。
    艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯企图造成一种印象，北大西洋公约组织的巴黎会议是成功的。为了掩盖巴黎会议上美国没有达到预定目标的事实，杜勒斯大肆吹嘘会议的军事“成就”。他把会议就美国向欧洲提供导弹勉强达成的“原则性”协议，说成是“最引人注目的决定”。
    杜勒斯还谈到希望加强西方的科学设备和情报汇合以进行军事科学的研究，以及北大西洋公约组织现在希望探求同美洲国家组织、东南亚条约组织和巴格达条约组织建立联系的可能性。
    杜勒斯在谈话中虽然竭力避免谈到巴黎会议反映出的北大西洋集团内部的深刻矛盾以及美国要实现它的一套打算所面临的严重困难，但是他也承认，“自由国家之间不时发生分歧和不满，这是不可避免的，不管我们进行如何艰苦或巧妙的努力。”他竭力要求西方国家“相互依赖”和“团结”。他说，要能实现巴黎会议的决定，将需要“持久的努力和牺牲”。
