    Methods for Identifying Radios
    Lu Tianming
    The quality of a radio should be checked from both its electrical and mechanical performance. Our country has not yet formulated standards for radios of various grades. State-owned factories generally use Soviet standards as quality indicators. The following are some simple identification methods for your reference.
    1. Output Power Test: Output power refers to the loudness of the speaker. The greater the power, the louder the sound. Output power comes in several types: 4 volt-amperes, 1.5 volt-amperes, and 0.5 volt-amperes. If the output power is 4 volt-amperes, the sound from the speaker can be heard clearly and loudly in every corner of a room with a volume of 850 cubic meters; if the output power is 1.5 volt-amperes, it can be heard clearly within 300 cubic meters; if the output power is 0.5 volt-amperes, it can be heard clearly within 70 cubic meters.
    2. Sensitivity Test: Sensitivity refers to the ability to receive broadcasts from various radio stations. This can be tested by comparison, comparing the radio being tested with another good radio. During the test, start with the lowest frequency, then compare the middle and higher frequencies to see if the two radios receive the same number of stations and the same volume.
    3. Selectivity Test: When listening to the broadcast of one radio station, if it is not mixed with the broadcast of other radio stations, it indicates that the radio has good selectivity. During the test, you can listen to any two radio stations within a range of 20 kilocycles to see if they interfere with each other. If there is interference, it indicates that the radio's selectivity is too poor.
    4. Fidelity Test: The sound emitted by the radio should not be harsh or muddy, but soft and pleasing, which indicates good fidelity.
    5. Noise Test: A good radio should be very quiet when the tuning dial is turned to a place where there is no broadcast, or there should only be a slight hum (i.e., a continuous buzzing sound that cannot be heard from more than one foot away); when listening to a radio broadcast, there should be no howling, hum, or hissing sound.
    6. Heat Test: During the test, the radio can be turned on for four hours, and then touch the transformer to see if it is hot (the hand should not be burned), and see if there is any fluid flowing out of the transformer and capacitor, and touch each resistor (except for the filter resistor) to see if it is hot. If there are no above mentioned phenomena, it indicates that it is a good radio.
    7. Structure Check: Rotate each knob to see if it is flexible. But it should not wobble up and down or left and right, nor should it be rotated violently. Then rotate the waveband (long, medium, short wave) back and forth several times to see if it will cause the radio to stop working (especially the short wave).
    This method of using the senses to identify the quality of a radio is not very accurate, but it does have a certain effect. (Excerpted from Commercial Work Weekly)

    鉴别收音机的方法
    鲁天明
    收音机的好坏，应该从它的电器性能和机械性能两方面来检查。我国现在还没有制定出各级收音机的标准，国营工厂一般都以苏联的标准作为质量指标。苏联将收音机分为四个等级，最好的属于一级。这里介绍的，是一些简易的鉴别方法，供大家参考。
    1、输出功率测验：输出功率是指喇叭的声音大小，功率越大，声音就越大。输出功率有四伏安、一点五伏安、零点五伏安几种。如果输出功率为四伏安，喇叭发出来的声音在八百五十立方公尺的屋内，每个角落都能听到清晰、洪亮的声音；输出功率为一点五伏安，则在三百立方公尺之内听得清楚；输出功率零点五伏安的，在七十立方公尺内听得清楚。
    2、灵敏度测试：灵敏度就是指接收各地电台播音的能力。这可用比较的方法，把被测试的收音机和另一良好的收音机作比较。测试时可由最低的周率开始，然后比较中间的和较高的周率，看这两个收音机所收的电台多少、声音大小是不是相同。
    3、选择性测试：收听一个电台的播音时，如果不夹杂其它电台的播音，说明这个收音机的选择性好。测试时，可在相差二十千周波的范围内，收听任何两个电台，看看是否互相干扰，如有干扰，说明这个收音机选择性太差。
    4、传真度测试：收音机发出的声音，不刺耳、不混浊，柔和、动听，即表示传真度好。
    5、杂声测试：良好的收音机，当度盘转到没有播音的地方，应该很寂静，或仅有轻微的交流声（即连续的嗡嗡声，一尺以外就听不到了）；收听电台播音时，没有啸叫声、交流声和嘶嘶声。
    6、热度测试：测试时，可将收音机连开四小时，然后用手摸摸变压器是否发烫（手不能触），看看变压器和电容器是否有流质流出，用手摸摸各个电阻（滤波电阻除外）是否发热。如果没有上述现象，说明是个好收音机。
    7、结构检查：旋转每个转扭，看看是否灵活。但不应上下左右摇晃，也不应猛力旋转。再把波段（长、中、短波）来回旋转几次，看看是否会使收音机停止工作（尤其是短波）。
    这种用感官鉴别收音机质量的方法，虽然不够精确，但也有一定的作用。（摘自商业工作周报）
