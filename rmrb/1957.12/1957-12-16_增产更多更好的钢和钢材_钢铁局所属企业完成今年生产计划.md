　　Xinhua News Agency, December 13th: Enterprises under the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry have completed this year's steel and steel material production plans ahead of schedule and with overproduction. As of December 8th, steel production exceeded the annual plan by 90,000 tons, and steel material production exceeded the plan by 260,000 tons.
    In order to increase the production of more steel and steel materials for the country, the enterprises under this bureau have adopted a series of technical and organizational measures this year. First, in light of China's scrap steel resources, many measures have been taken in steelmaking production to minimize the use of scrap steel. At present, scrap steel is completely unused in alkaline converter steelmaking; the amount of pig iron used in open-hearth steelmaking has been generally increased; some units are now able to successfully use 90% pig iron in the charge for steelmaking and have successfully completed the test work of using all pig iron for steelmaking. The amount of pig iron used in electric furnace steelmaking has also been greatly increased. This has created conditions for producing more steel. Secondly, efforts have been concentrated on organizing and promoting many technical operation experiences and improving several production equipment around saving metal and fuel. According to the situation in the first three quarters, due to the improvement of the quality of steel ingots and steel materials, steel production increased by about 12,000 tons and steel material production increased by about 8,500 tons; as a result of promoting experience such as rolling according to negative tolerances in steel rolling production, about 20,000 tons of steel material were saved; due to the reduction of metal material consumption in steelmaking, steel production increased by about 12,000 tons. In order to save fuel, some improvements have been made to some thermal equipment and process procedures. For example, strengthening the thermal control of open-hearth furnaces has greatly improved fuel utilization; the use of automatic reversing devices for meeting gas in open-hearth furnaces can save 3% of gas. In steel rolling production, 35% of heating furnaces have adopted air preheaters this year, and this measure alone can save about 8% of coal consumption. In addition, oxygen is also widely used in electric furnace steelmaking. Currently, nearly 90% of electric furnace steel is made with oxygen. This has played a significant role in improving the quality of steel, reducing electricity consumption, and improving the utilization rate of electric furnace equipment.
    In the first three quarters of this year, the enterprises under the Iron and Steel Bureau successfully trial-produced more than 80 new varieties, including certain special ferroalloys and various nickel-chromium steel substitutes that were previously dependent on imports.

### 增产更多更好的钢和钢材  钢铁局所属企业完成今年生产计划

　　增产更多更好的钢和钢材
    钢铁局所属企业完成今年生产计划
    新华社13日讯　冶金工业部钢铁工业管理局所属企业已经提前超额完成今年钢和钢材的生产计划。截至本月8日统计，钢比年度计划超产九万吨，钢材超产二十六万吨。
    这个局所属企业为给国家增产更多的钢和钢材，今年采取了一系列的技术组织措施。首先结合我国废钢资源情况，在炼钢生产中采取了许多措施，达到了尽量少用废钢的要求。目前在碱性转炉炼钢中已完全不用废钢；在平炉炼钢中配用生铁的数量，普遍提高；部分单位目前已能成功地在配料中使用90％的生铁炼钢，并且顺利完成了全部用生铁炼钢的试验工作。电炉炼钢中生铁配用量也大大提高了。这样就为增产更多的钢创造了条件。其次，是集中力量、围绕节约金属和燃料，组织推广了许多技术操作经验，改进了若干生产设备。根据前三个季度的情况，由于钢锭和钢材质量的提高，就增产钢约一万二千吨，钢材约八千五百吨；在轧钢生产中推广按负公差轧制等经验的结果，节约了钢料约二万吨；由于炼钢金属料消耗的降低，共增产钢约一万二千吨。为了节约燃料，对部分热工设备和工艺过程进行了一些改进。如加强平炉热工控制，使燃料利用情况大大改善；平炉采用相遇煤气的自动换向装置，即可节约煤气3％。在轧钢生产中，今年已经有35％的加热炉采用了空气预热器，仅这项措施可以节约煤耗约8％。此外，在电炉炼钢中，还广泛地采用了氧气，目前将近90％的电炉钢是采用氧气炼出的。这对改善钢的质量、降低电耗以及提高电炉设备利用率，都起了很大作用。
    钢铁局所属企业在今年前三个季度里，试制成功了八十多种新品种，其中包括一向依靠进口供应的某些特殊铁合金和多种镍铬钢代用品等。
