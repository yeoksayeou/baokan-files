Comrades!

    I am deeply honored to represent my organization, the Ceylon Labour Union, to extend fraternal congratulations and best wishes to your congress. I thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak here, and I must also express my gratitude for your invitation to China and the very friendly arrangements you have made.

    The Ceylon Labour Union, which I represent, is no stranger to China. Our organization has sent several delegations to your country. Not long ago, Comrade Perera, the chairman of our union, accepted the invitation of your government and visited China. On our part, we are greatly pleased to have been able to welcome a Chinese trade union delegation to Ceylon not long ago. Therefore, the Ceylon Labour Union has sent me to attend this congress with the most sincere pleasure to extend to you the warmest congratulations. Allow me, on behalf of the Ceylon Labour Union, to once again congratulate you on the success of your congress.

    Comrades, it is fitting that workers' representatives from many countries are attending the congress. It is fitting because workers all over the world, regardless of race, creed, or nationality, have common goals and interests, and are united in the same great class with solid fraternal friendship.

    But it must be remembered that there are very significant differences between us and you. You, the Chinese workers, have already taken this great country into your own hands and are striving to build a new society on the ruins of the old society. I can add that you occupy a special place in our hearts and in our feelings, because your victory and your achievements are a source of inspiration for all of us Asians. Comrades, in other words, your revolution has been victorious, but we still have to complete our revolution. There is no doubt that we will have that day too. And I believe that such a day is not too far away. When that day comes, we will also take the fate of our country into our own hands, and we will seek assistance from the great Chinese working class. We can fully believe that our Chinese class brothers will not disappoint us.

    At the beginning of this congress, Comrade Lai Ruoyu mentioned the struggle against imperialism and the struggle for peace. We in Asia understand the relationship between war and imperialism very clearly. The struggle for peace is already a struggle waged by the working classes of all countries side by side.

    In this regard, Comrade Lai Ruoyu made a correct statement when he spoke of the international solidarity of the working class. Comrades, I think we all experience that, at different times, the imperialist countries always collude with each other; if necessary, one imperialist country will help another imperialist country. For example, the Indonesian representative here can tell you that we have seen British imperialism help Dutch imperialism, and we have seen the imperialist countries headed by the United States collude with each other internationally, so we must also take concerted action internationally.

    I have said that it is fitting that many foreign workers' representatives are gathered here, and I can say even more that it is of great significance. Because we all know, comrades, that the day will come when the workers of all countries will stand up and forever eliminate the exploitative capitalist system from the earth.

    Long live the victory of the great Chinese working class!

    Long live the international solidarity of the working class!

    Long live the world socialist revolution!

### 锡兰劳工联合会代表维蒂雅萨卡拉致词

    锡兰劳工联合会代表维蒂雅萨卡拉致词同志们！
    我能代表我的组织——锡兰劳工联合会向你们的代表大会致以兄弟般的祝贺，并且表达最好的愿望，深感荣幸。我感谢你们给我在这里致词的机会，同时，我不得不对你们邀请我到中国并作了十分友好的安排，表示感谢。
    对中国来说，我所代表的锡兰劳工联合会是并不生疏的。我们的组织曾经派遣了几个代表团来过贵国。在不久以前，我们联合会的主席佩瑞拉同志曾经接受贵国政府的邀请，访问了中国。在我们方面，我们感到极大愉快的是，在不久以前，能欢迎中国工会代表团访问锡兰。因此，锡兰劳工联合会以最真诚的愉快心情派我出席这次大会，向你们致以最热烈的祝贺。允许我代表锡兰劳工联合会再一次祝贺你们大会的成功。
    同志们，许多国家的工人代表出席了大会，这是应当的。所以说是应当的，是因为全世界的工人，不管种族、信仰和国籍如何，都具有共同的目标与利益，都以巩固的兄弟友谊，团结在同一个伟大的阶级里。
    但是必须记住，我们和你们之间，有很重大的区别。你们中国工人已经把这个伟大的国家掌握在自己的手里，努力地在旧社会的废墟上建立一个新的社会。我可以再加一句，在我们的心里，你们在我们的感情中占有特殊的地位，因为你们的胜利和你们的成就是我们所有亚洲人的一个鼓舞的源泉。同志们，换一句话说，你们的革命已经胜利了，可是我们还得来完成我们的革命。毫无疑问，我们也将同样地有这一天。而且我相信，这样的一天并不太遥远的。当这一天到来的时候，我们也会同样地把我国的命运掌握在自己的手里，我们就要向伟大的中国工人阶级争取援助。我们完全可以相信，我们中国的阶级兄弟们一定不会使我们失望的。
    在这次大会开始的时候，赖若愚同志提到了反对帝国主义的斗争和争取和平的斗争。我们在亚洲对于战争与帝国主义之间的关系是懂得非常清楚的。争取和平的斗争已经是各国工人阶级并肩进行的斗争。
    在这方面，赖若愚同志在讲到国际工人阶级团结的问题时作了正确的叙述。同志们，我想我们都体验到，在各个不同时期，帝国主义国家总是互相勾结的；如果有需要，一个帝国主义国家就会帮助另一个帝国主义国家。比方，像这里的印度尼西亚代表就可以告诉你们，我们看到英国帝国主义帮助荷兰帝国主义，我们看到以美国为首的帝国主义国家在国际上相互勾结，因此我们也必须在国际上采取一致行动。
    我已经说过，许多外国工人代表集会在这里是应当的，我更可以说是有重要意义的。因为我们都知道，同志们，这个日子将要到来，到那一天，各国工人将要站起来，把剥削性的资本主义制度从地球上永远消灭掉。
    祝伟大的中国工人阶级胜利！
    国际工人阶级团结万岁！
    世界社会主义革命万岁！
