　Implementing the Policy of "Prevention First," Emphasizing Military Medical Scientific Research
　　The People's Liberation Army's Health Undertakings Have Great Development

　　(Our Dispatch) In recent years, the health undertakings of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have greatly developed.

　　Under the guidance of firmly implementing the health work policy of "prevention first," in recent years, various units of the PLA have taken active measures to control the spread of various acute infectious diseases in the troops, such as smallpox, meningitis, typhus, and relapsing fever. Especially in troops performing border and coastal defense tasks, systematic investigation and research, as well as planned prevention and treatment of malaria, schistosomiasis, and dysentery, have not only guaranteed the health of the officers and soldiers but also greatly helped local residents improve their sanitation conditions. For example, in some areas of the Yunnan border, malaria was highly prevalent. Local residents believed that in the malarial areas, the army could "enter but not leave." In 1952, the PLA dispatched more than 300 medical experts, professors, and health cadres to form the Yunnan Anti-Malaria General Team, and mobilized health personnel in the troops to form a nearly 2,000-strong anti-malaria force to conduct on-the-spot investigations in the malarial areas. In March 1953, a large-scale anti-malaria campaign was launched in the troops. After several years of efforts by the military and civilians, the spread of malaria in these areas has now been basically controlled. For example, the incidence of malaria in 1956 decreased by more than 95% compared to 1952. Various units also emphasized health education and propaganda. Learning health knowledge has become a regular part of the officers and soldiers' curriculum. Now, all soldiers have developed good hygiene habits.

　　In recent years, in addition to building and expanding many hospitals and sanatoriums, and enriching medical equipment, the PLA has also improved its medical technology and medical effects year by year. In terms of medical technology, many new disciplines such as cardiothoracic surgery and plastic surgery have been developed. The medical technology level of some disciplines (such as lung resection and esophageal cancer surgery) has reached the international scientific level. Since its establishment last year, the PLA Chest Hospital has performed esophageal resection surgery on 47 patients, with a 100% cure rate. The emergency surgery hospital established in 1955 has also achieved good results in the surgical treatment of acute cholecystitis, gastritis, and enteritis in the past year or so; some of the research on the treatment of acute bone injuries and bone transplantation has also reached the international level. The PLA Plastic Surgery Hospital, which was just established this year on the "August 1st" Army Day, has also achieved good results in the late-stage treatment and research of severe war injuries. At present, some disabled patients with partial organic defects have had their functions restored after repair and plastic surgery. For example, for soldiers with hand defects, the ulna and radius are separated into a pincer shape, and this pincer-like action can become flexible and powerful after practice, and they can slowly eat, brush their teeth, and write. Due to the continuous improvement of medical technology, the continuous improvement of nursing work, and the firm implementation of the policy of "health personnel facing the company," the cure rate and bed turnover rate have been increased. For example, the average cure rate of patients was 71.2% in 1953 and 96.2% in 1956; the bed turnover rate was 64.4% on average in 1953 and 86.8% on average in 1956. Some hospitals have had no accidents in the past three years.

　　In recent years, some achievements have also been made in military medical science. For example, since 1951, the PLA Academy of Military Medical Sciences has conducted research on many topics such as aviation physiology, defense against nuclear weapons, and chemical weapon injuries. As of August last year, it had completed more than 270 scientific papers. In addition, medical scientists and medical workers in many troop health agencies have conducted investigations and research on major infectious diseases in the troop garrison areas; investigations of the nutritional status of various services and units in the Kangzang Plateau, Xinjiang, and other regions, and research on nutritional standards; the late treatment of severe trauma; and the research on the manufacture of dried plasma and blood substitutes have also achieved good results. For example, the dried plasma successfully developed by Professor Wang Keqin and others can not only be stored for seven to ten years, and is easy to carry and preserve, but also does not require blood type verification when used, and has rich nutrition. It plays a decisive role in preventing shock in acute injuries or treating injured who have already developed shock.

　　In the past year, the PLA Academy of Military Medical Sciences, various military medical universities, general hospitals of various troops, chest hospitals, etc. have held academic conferences and presented a total of more than 700 scientific papers, many of which are creative research results conducted in actual work and have a considerable high scientific level.

　  贯彻“预防为主”的方针　重视军事医学科学研究
　　解放军卫生事业有很大发展
    本报讯　几年来，中国人民解放军的卫生事业有了很大的发展。
    在坚决贯彻“预防为主”的卫生工作方针的指导下，几年来，解放军各个部队采取了积极措施，控制了各种急性传染病，如天花、脑膜炎、斑疹伤寒、回归热等疾病在部队里流行。特别是在担任边防、海防任务的部队中，由于对疟疾、血丝虫病、痢疾进行了系统的调查研究和有计划的防治，不仅使部队官兵的健康得到了保证，而且帮助当地居民大大地改善了卫生状况。例如，云南边防某些地区疟疾流行非常严重，当地居民认为：军队在瘴气区是“进得来，出不去”的。1952年，解放军抽调了医学专家、教授和卫生干部三百多人，成立了云南抗疟总队，并且动员了部队里的卫生人员，组成了近两千人的防疟大军，深入瘴气区进行了实地调查。1953年3月，开展了规模巨大的部队防疟运动。经过军民几年的努力，现在这些地区已经基本上控制了疟疾的流行。如1956年疟疾发病率比1952年降低了95％以上。各个部队还重视了卫生宣传教育工作。学习卫生知识已经成为官兵们经常的课业。现在，全体军人都养成了良好的卫生习惯。
    几年来，解放军除了新建和扩建了许多医院和疗养院，充实了医疗设备以外，在医疗技术和医疗效果方面也逐年有了提高。在医疗技术方面，发展了心肺外科、整形外科等许多新的学科。有些学科的医疗技术水平（如肺切除和食管癌手术）已经达到了国际科学水平。解放军胸科医院自去年建院以来，曾经给四十七个病人施行了食管切除手术，治愈率100％。1955年建立的急症外科医院，一年多以来，在急性的胆道炎、胃炎和肠炎的外科治疗方面，也收到了良好的效果；在急性骨损伤的治疗和骨移植的研究方面，有些也达到国际水平。今年“八一”建军节刚建立的解放军整形外科医院，在严重战伤的晚期治疗和研究方面也取得良好的成绩。目前已经使一些部分机体缺损的残废病员，经过修补和整形以后，恢复了功能。如对手缺损的伤员，经过把尺骨和桡骨分开成为钳状，这种钳状的动作经过练习可以变得灵活、有力，慢慢能够吃饭、刷牙和写字。由于医疗技术水平的不断提高，护理工作的不断改进，和坚决贯彻了“卫生人员面向连队”的方针，提高了治疗率和病床周转率。如病人的平均治愈率1953年是71.2％，1956年是96.2％；病床周转率1953年平均是64.4％，1956年平均是86.8％，有些医院三年来没有发生过事故。
    几年来，在军事医学科学方面也作出了一些成绩。如解放军医学科学院自1951年以来，对航空生理、防核子武器和化学武器伤等许多专题进行了研究，到去年8月份为止，已经完成了二百七十多篇科学论文。此外，许多部队卫生机关的医学家和医务工作者，在对部队驻在区主要传染病的调查研究方面；在对各军种和康藏高原、新疆等地区部队营养情况的调查和营养标准的研究方面；在对严重创伤的晚期治疗方面，以及制造干血浆和血液代替品的研究等方面，也取得了很好的成绩。如王克勤教授等试制成功的干血浆，不仅能保存七至十年，便于携带和保存，用的时候不必查验血型，而且有丰富的营养。在防止急性伤员发生休克或已发生休克的伤员的治疗方面有决定性的作用。
    最近一年来，解放军医学科学院、各军医大学、各部队总医院、胸科医院等分别举行了学术会议，共提出了七百多篇科学论文，其中不少是在实际工作中所进行的创造性的研究成果，具有相当高的科学水平。
