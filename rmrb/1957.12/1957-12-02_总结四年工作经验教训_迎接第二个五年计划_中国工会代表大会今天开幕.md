Xinhua News Agency, 1st - The Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions will open in Beijing on December 2nd.

　　The main tasks of this congress are to summarize the experiences and lessons of China's trade union work over the past four years based on the spirit of the resolutions of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, to discuss and decide on the specific tasks of the national workers and trade unions during the Second Five-Year Plan, and to revise the Constitution of Chinese Trade Unions and elect the Eighth Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions based on the experience of recent years and the current actual situation.

　　All preparations for the meeting have been completed. The nine hundred and eighty-nine formal representatives and one hundred and one alternate representatives elected by trade union organizations at all levels have mostly arrived in Beijing. They belong to twenty-nine industrial systems, including industry, transportation, agriculture, water conservancy, salt industry, forestry, commerce, culture, and education, as well as local trade union organizations in various provinces and cities. Many of them are activists in production or trade union work who emerged during the First Five-Year Plan. According to statistics, among all the representatives, there are a total of two hundred model workers and advanced producers. Among the representatives, there are also more than one hundred and forty veteran trade union workers who have been engaged in the workers' movement for more than ten years, and more than fifty representatives of ethnic minority workers. After gathering in Beijing, the representatives held a preparatory meeting from the 28th to the 30th, reading and discussing the three reports to be submitted to the congress for discussion, and putting forward many opinions for modification and supplementation.

　　The Seventh Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions held its last meeting on the 29th, discussed and in principle approved the documents and reports to be submitted to the "Eighth Congress" of trade unions for discussion, and completed an important preparation for the congress.

　　In order to welcome this meeting of great historical significance, since the first half of this year, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, various industrial trade unions, and local trade union organizations at all levels have carried out a relatively long period of ideological and organizational preparation. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions convened a national conference of trade union activists in August to summarize and exchange practical experience in trade union work, and convened an enlarged meeting of the Party group in September to clarify some confused ideas of some trade union cadres on the guiding principles and tasks of trade union work, and unified understanding. Subsequently, a national conference of trade union representatives was convened to discuss the current development of the rectification movement and further welcome the new production upsurge. All of these have created favorable conditions for the success of this congress.

    总结四年工作经验教训　迎接第二个五年计划
　　中国工会代表大会今天开幕
    新华社1日讯　中国工会第八次全国代表大会12月2日将在北京开幕。
    这次大会的主要任务是根据中国共产党第八次全国代表大会决议的精神，总结四年来我国工会工作的经验教训，讨论和决定全国职工和工会在第二个五年计划期间的具体任务，并且根据几年来的经验和当前的实际情况，修订中国工会章程，选举中华全国总工会第八届执行委员会。
    会议的各项准备工作都已完成。各级工会组织选出的九百八十九个正式代表和一百零一个候补代表，绝大部分已经到达北京。他们分别属于工业、交通、农业水利、盐业、林业、商业、文化、教育等二十九个产业系统和各省市地方工会组织。其中有不少人是第一个五年计划期间出现的生产上的或工会工作中的积极分子。据统计，在全体代表中，劳动模范和先进生产者共有二百人。代表中还有一百四十多个从事工人运动十年以上的老工会工作者；还有少数民族工人代表五十多人。代表们在聚集北京以后，在28日到30日举行了预备会议，对于将要提交大会讨论的三个报告进行了阅读和讨论，并且提出了不少修改和补充的意见。
    全国总工会第七届执行委员会在29日举行了最后一次会议，讨论和原则通过了提交工会“八大”讨论的文件和报告等事项，完成了大会的一项重要的准备工作。
    为了迎接这个具有重大历史意义的会议，从今年上半年以来，全国总工会、各产业工会和地方各级工会组织都进行了比较长时期的思想和组织准备工作。全国总工会在8月份召开了全国工会积极分子代表大会，总结交流了工会工作中的实际经验，9月份召开了党组扩大会议，澄清了部分工会干部对于工会工作方针任务认识上的一些混乱思想，统一了认识。接着，又召开了全国工会代表会议，讨论了关于当前开展整风运动以及进一步迎接新的生产高潮的问题。这些都为开好这个大会创造了有利条件。
