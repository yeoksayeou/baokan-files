　　The Ranks of Ethnic Minority Workers are Growing
　　-- An Interview with Ethnic Minority Representatives --
　　By Our Correspondent　Ye Jianyun
    Our country is a multi-ethnic nation. In addition to the Han people, there are more than fifty ethnic minorities living here. Although the population of ethnic minorities is only more than 35 million, accounting for 6% of the country's total population, they live in areas that account for 60% of the country's total area. In the years of reactionary rule, they suffered oppression and devastation. After liberation, the situation underwent fundamental changes. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, by 1956, 423 modern industrial and mining enterprises had been built in ethnic minority areas. In the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, more than 100 industrial enterprises with considerable scale in steel, machinery manufacturing, textile, silk reeling, and fur have been successively built in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains. When Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was first established, there were fewer than 60 workshops, and only a few small power plants with dilapidated equipment and a woolen mill could barely be called modern industry. Now, modern factories are being built one after another. The large-scale Baotou Iron and Steel Complex is under accelerated construction. Last year, Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Prefecture newly built and expanded more than 40 factories and mines. Currently, the Tianyang Gold Mine, which produces 8,000 to 10,000 taels of gold per year, is under construction. In Sichuan, on the grasslands where the Red Army passed during the Long March, several dairy processing plants, power plants, and coal mines are also under construction and preparation for construction. The industrial output value of Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Jilin Province has accounted for 76% of the total industrial and agricultural output value of the autonomous prefecture. The unprecedented large-scale geological exploration work in progress further indicates the bright prospects for industrial development in ethnic minority areas. Since 1952, more than 90 geological exploration teams have been conducting surveys in ethnic minority areas. According to the geological data that has been obtained, there are extremely rich iron ore reserves, overflowing underground oil seas, inexhaustible coal seams, as well as non-ferrous metals, rare metals, non-metallic minerals, and water resources in ethnic minority areas. It has everything.
    Due to the rapid development of industry in ethnic minority areas, a contingent of ethnic minority workers has been formed. Although this contingent now has only 160,000 people, this clear fact tells us that ethnic minorities have fundamentally changed their backward economic conditions and are gradually embarking on the ranks of advanced nations. A situation from nothing to something, from small to large, has already unfolded before us.
    At the moment when industry in ethnic minority areas is thriving and the contingent of ethnic minority workers is rapidly growing, I interviewed ethnic minority representatives from the frontier of the motherland who attended the Eighth National Congress of Trade Unions.
    The speech of U守洛夫, the Xinjiang Autonomous Region Uygur representative and vice chairman of the autonomous region's trade union, ignited people's hopes and ideals like a poem. He said that the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang are good at riding horses. After liberation, the growth rate of ethnic minority workers is like a horse galloping at full speed, not several times, dozens of times, but hundreds of times. During the period of reactionary rule, there were less than 500 ethnic minority workers in the entire region; now it has developed to more than 125,000 people; next year it will develop to more than 150,000 people. Taking Kashgar, the main city of southern Xinjiang, as an example, there was not a single factory with 20 people gathered together to produce before liberation. Now, there is a hydroelectric power station here, and the city has thousands of industrial workers. Yili in northern Xinjiang, even in its heyday, had only a leather factory with nearly 100 people. Now there are several factories with more than 100 people. Three state trade unions, three municipal trade unions, sixteen county trade unions, and fourteen industrial trade unions have been established throughout the region…
    The people of ethnic minorities in our country are hardworking and brave. They use their tenacious hands and passionate feelings to actively engage in socialist construction. There is a Mongolian girl in the Inner Mongolia delegation named Modeg, who is a milkmaid at the Teni River State-owned Ranch in Hulunbuir League. As soon as she entered the ranch, her excellent production results were recorded on the ranch's honor roll. In winter, heavy snow closed the grassland, and dairy cows began to die due to lack of feed. This girl, who had been herding cattle and sheep for the herdsman since she was 14 years old, dug out grass from a foot and a half deep snowdrift in the bitter cold of minus 40 degrees Celsius. Although there was grass, the dairy cows were too hungry and cold to even get up from the ground to chew the grass. At this time, she came up with a way to cook corn porridge for them. Feed them three times a day and give them water three times a day. Others managed 17 cows, but she managed 38. Not only did none of these cows die, but on the contrary, they gained 70% of their weight. The milk yield of the dairy cows she raised increased from 20 kilograms a day to 280 kilograms. When she first entered the ranch, the enterprise was newly established and the equipment was very poor. The cowshed had no walls. In winter, the wind on the grassland was like a sharp knife, making people shiver. She had to work ten hours a day, and the cowsheds were scattered. She had to walk dozens of miles back and forth to finish one milking trip. Her hands were chapped, festered, and oozed pus, but she didn't complain. She often said to people: "I am an ordinary shepherd girl. Today, I am able to participate in the socialist state-owned ranch and contribute to socialism. It doesn't matter if I suffer a little bit." These simple words fully reflect the desire of people of all ethnic groups to enthusiastically build socialism.
    The result of the people of all ethnic groups enthusiastically building socialism is that the economy of their own ethnic groups has developed rapidly. The production and living conditions of the people of all ethnic groups have also been improved. The speech of Pu Changliang, the Yi representative from Yunnan Province who attended the conference, fully confirmed this. Pu Changliang is 26 years old this year and lives in Luoshuidong Township, Second District, Longwu County, Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture. In 1952, when he was 21 years old, he changed from a farmer of an ethnic minority to a worker of his own ethnic minority.
    This is a happy young man. He talked about winter in Yunnan, and he also talked about spring there. "Right in this place where the four seasons are like spring," he said, "the Party and the state helped us build many factories, and our small town of Longwu also built an iron factory. I am a hammer worker in this iron factory."
    When people mention small town iron factories, they can imagine that it is a small factory with a small scale and manual operation. However, when Pu Changliang talked about it, the significance of this matter was extraordinary.
      "Our motherland has Anshan Iron and Steel, and the Yi people regard it as a pearl in their palms. Longwu Iron Factory has only more than 100 workers. Compared with Anshan Iron and Steel, it is like comparing a grain of rice to an elephant. Although it is small, the people of all ethnic groups there regard it as a remarkable event." He was afraid that I would not understand what he meant, so he repeatedly talked about many situations.
    According to his explanation, this small iron factory should be called a school and a treasure pot for people of all ethnic groups. In the past, let alone young people, even the elderly in their seventies and eighties had never seen a factory in Longwu. At that time, the compatriots of all ethnic groups in the mountainous areas suffered from the exploitation of merchants. Buying a needle required seven or eight catties of rice, and exchanging a hoe required seven or eight dou. The girls thinned the bamboo slices to sew clothes, and the young men cut down large trees in the mountains, burned off the branches and leaves, and then burned the trunks thinly to make agricultural tools such as plows and harrows. Although the situation has improved a lot after liberation, under the conditions of inconvenient transportation, it is still a major difficulty for people of all ethnic groups to lack agricultural tools when transporting materials from afar into the mountainous areas. Since Longwu built an iron factory, the situation has changed greatly. They can not only choose all kinds of plowshares and hoes in the supply and marketing cooperative, but also these things are made by the workers of their own ethnic groups.
    Pu Changliang said that when he first entered the factory, he could not speak a word of Chinese or write a Chinese character. After five years, his Chinese level is almost equivalent to graduating from senior elementary school.
    Among the 694 key construction projects stipulated during the First Five-Year Plan period, 472 projects were distributed in the interior and ethnic minority areas in the frontier. Now the First Five-Year Plan is about to end, and the Second Five-Year Plan is calling us. With the rapid development of our country's socialist construction, the ranks of ethnic minority workers will be further expanded during the Second Five-Year Plan period.

　　少数民族工人的队伍在成长中
　　——访少数民族代表——
　　本报记者　叶剑韵
    我国是一个多民族的国家，除了汉族以外，还居住着五十个以上的少数民族。少数民族的人口虽然只有三千五百多万，占全国总人口的6％；可是居住的地方却占了全国总面积的60％。在反动统治的年代里，他们受尽了压迫和摧残。解放后，情况发生了根本的变化。建国以来，到1956年，少数民族地区已经建成了四百二十三个现代工矿企业。在新疆维吾尔自治区，天山南北相继建成了一百多个有相当规模的钢铁、机器制造、纺织、缫丝、皮毛等工业企业。内蒙古刚成立自治区的时候，只有不到六十个作坊，勉强称为近代工业的只有几处设备破旧的小发电厂和一所毛织厂。现在现代化的工厂一个接一个地建立起来了。规模宏大的包头钢铁联合企业，正在加紧建设。桂西僮族自治州去年新建扩建了四十多个厂矿，目前，正在建设一座年产八千到一万两黄金的田阳金矿厂。在四川，当年红军长征经过的草地上，几座奶品加工厂、发电厂和煤矿也正在修建和准备修建。吉林省延边朝鲜族自治州的工业产值，已占到自治州工农业总产值的76％。正在进行的空前规模的地质勘探工作，更预示着少数民族地区工业发展的光辉远景。从1952年开始，先后有九十多个地质勘探队在少数民族地区进行查勘。据已经取得的地质资料证实，在少数民族地区有藏量极为丰富的铁矿，有溢流地下的石油海，有取之不尽的煤层，还有有色金属、稀有金属、非金属矿和水力资源，真是应有尽有。
    由于少数民族地区的工业有了迅速的发展，一支少数民族的工人队伍已经形成。现在，这支队伍虽然只有十六万人，可是，这件显明的事实却告诉了我们：各少数民族从根本上改变经济落后的状况，逐步走上先进民族的行列，一个从无到有，从小到大的局面已经展现在我们面前了。
    就在少数民族地区的工业蒸蒸日上，少数民族工人的队伍迅速成长壮大的时刻，我访问了来自祖国边疆出席工会第八次代表大会的少数民族代表。
    新疆自治区维吾尔族代表、自治区工会副主席乌守洛夫的谈话，像诗一样燃起了人们的希望和理想。他说，新疆各族人民是善于骑马的，解放后，民族工人成长的速度就像快马加鞭一样，不是几倍、几十倍，而是成百倍的。反动统治时期，全区的少数民族工人还不足五百人；现在已经发展到十二万五千多人；明年将发展到十五万多人。拿南疆的主要城市喀什市来说，解放前没有一个二十人集中在一起生产的厂子。现在，这里有了水力发电站，全市拥有数千名产业工人。北疆的伊犁，在鼎盛时期，也只有一个近百人的皮革厂，现在百人以上的厂子就有好几个。全区成立了三个州工会，三个市工会，十六个县工会，十四个产业工会……
    我国少数民族的人民，是勤劳勇敢的。他们用坚忍的双手，用火热的心情，积极地从事社会主义建设。内蒙古代表团里有一位蒙族姑娘叫莫德格，她是呼伦贝尔盟特尼河国营牧场的一个挤奶工人。她一走进牧场，她的优异的生产成绩就被记载在牧场的光荣榜上。冬天，大雪封闭了草原，奶牛因缺乏饲料开始死亡。这个十四岁就给牧主放牛放羊的姑娘，在零下四十度的严寒的日子里，从一尺半深的雪堆子中间挖出草来。草虽有了，奶牛连饿带冻躺在地上爬不起来绞草吃。这时她就想了个办法，给它们煮玉米粥吃。一天喂三遍、饮三遍。别人管理十七条牛，她却管理了三十八条。这许多牛，不仅没有一头死亡，相反的还获得了七成膘。她饲养的奶牛，由一天挤二十公斤奶提高到二百八十公斤。刚进牧场，企业是新办的，设备很差，牛棚没有墙壁。冬天，草原上的风像尖刀一样刮得人直抖索。她每天要工作十个小时，牛棚又分散，往返要走几十里路才能挤完一趟奶。她的手冻破了，生了疮，出了脓，可是她没叫一声苦。她常对人说：“我是一个普通的牧羊姑娘，今天能够参加社会主义的国营牧场工作，为社会主义出一分力，苦一点累一点算不了什么。”这几句朴素的言语，充分地反映了各族人民热情地建设社会主义的心愿。
    各族人民热情地建设社会主义的结果，首先是本民族的经济得到了迅速的发展。各族人民的生产和生活状况也得到了改善。出席大会的云南省彝族代表普长亮的谈话充分地证实了这一点。普长亮今年二十六岁，家住红河哈尼族彝族自治州龙武县二区落水洞乡。1952年当他二十一岁的时候，他由一个少数民族的农民变成一个少数民族自己的工人了。
    这是一个心境舒畅的小伙子。他讲了云南的冬天，也讲了那里的春天。“就在这四季如春的地方，”他说：“党和国家帮助我们办了许多工厂，我们小小的龙武县城也办了铁工厂，我就是这个铁工厂的锤工。”
    提起小城镇的铁工厂，人们想像得到那是一个规模不大的，带有手工操作的小厂子，可是，普长亮谈起来，这件事的意义，却非同小可。
      “我们祖国有个鞍钢，彝族人民把它看成是一颗掌上的珍珠。龙武铁工厂只有一百多个工人，比比鞍钢，就像用一粒稻米去比一只大象。小虽小，那里的各族人民，却把它看成是一件了不起的大事。”他怕我不能领会他的意思，又反反复复地说了许多情况。
    根据他的解释，这个小小的铁工厂应当叫做学校，应当叫做各族人民的聚宝盆。过去，别说年青人，就是七八十的老年人也没见过龙武有过一个工厂。那时候，大山地区的各族同胞，受尽了商人的剥削。买一根针要七、八斤米，换一把锄头要七、八斗。姑娘们把竹片削细了缝衣服，小伙子们在大山里砍倒了大树，用火烧去枝叶，再把树干烧得细细的，就这样做成犁、耙等农具。解放后情况虽然好多了，但从老远的地方把物资运进山区，在交通不便的条件下，缺农具依旧是各族人民的一大困难。自从龙武办了铁工厂，情况大大地变了。他们不仅可以在供销社里挑选各式的犁铧和锄头，而且这些东西，还是本族工人亲手做的哩。
    普长亮说，他刚进厂的时候，一句汉语不会说，一个汉字不会写。经过了五年，他的汉语程度已经快相当于高小毕业了。
    第一个五年计划期间规定的六百九十四个重点建设项目，就有四百七十二个项目分布在内地和边疆的少数民族地区。现在第一个五年计划就要结束了，第二个五年计划正在召唤着我们。随着我国社会主义建设事业的飞速发展，在第二个五年计划期间内，少数民族工人的队伍将会得到进一步的扩展。
