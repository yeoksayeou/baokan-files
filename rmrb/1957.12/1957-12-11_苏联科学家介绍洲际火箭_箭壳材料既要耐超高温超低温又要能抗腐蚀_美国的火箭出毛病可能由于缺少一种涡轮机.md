　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 10th: Soviet Deputy Doctor of Technical Sciences and Engineering Major Parfenov recently published an article in the "Soviet Air Force Newspaper," discussing some urgent technical problems that scientists need to solve when manufacturing intercontinental ballistic rockets, and introducing various sturdy materials that can withstand ultra-high temperatures, ultra-low temperatures, and corrosion.
    The article stated that when an intercontinental rocket re-enters the atmosphere during the final stage of its trajectory, the temperature of the rocket's nose cone can reach 5,000 degrees. Even with cooling and deceleration measures, the material used to manufacture the rocket remains a critical issue.
    After analyzing the value of metals such as tungsten, rhenium, molybdenum, and niobium in rocket manufacturing, the article pointed out that even the most refractory and heat-resistant metals cannot ultimately solve the problem of rocket shell materials. In a few years, the era of rare "exotic" metals will soon be over, and the era of refractory clay and metal-ceramics will arrive.
    The article stated that clay is extremely difficult to melt, but it is too brittle and cannot withstand vibration and impact. To improve its ductility, 10% to 20% of powdered cobalt metal is mixed into the clay. The mixture is then heated to a very high temperature. The resulting solid, baked mixture is called metal-ceramic. This material can be used not only to manufacture rocket shells, but also to coat nozzles.
    The article pointed out that the temperature of the gas flow ejected from the combustion chamber is as high as 3,000 degrees. Cooling the combustion chamber and nozzle is an extremely complex problem. This problem has now been successfully solved. One solution is to manufacture a "sweating" wall. Liquid seeps out under enormous pressure from the walls of the combustion chamber and nozzle, which have many fine pores, and need to be cooled. These small droplets evaporate immediately, carrying away a large amount of heat from the wall.
    The article stated that in the liquid oxygen storage tank on the rocket, the temperature is almost as low as minus two hundred degrees Celsius. Ordinary metals and alloys become as brittle as glass at such ultra-low temperatures and are completely unsuitable for use as materials for manufacturing storage tanks. It is necessary to manufacture an alloy with high ductility under high vacuum conditions. Sometimes the walls of the oxygen storage tank are not made of metal alloys, but of special plastics – fluorocarbons. Sometimes rockets use concentrated nitric acid as an oxidizer. Concentrated nitric acid is extremely corrosive and can destroy many metals. Its storage tank, as well as the pipes that send it into the combustion chamber, are made of plastic. However, the parts for manufacturing compression and injection devices must have materials that are not only chemically stable, but also sufficiently strong and wear-resistant. Covering these parts with a layer of tantalum can solve this problem.
    The article pointed out that in the manufacture of the extremely complex automatic devices and radio equipment that constitute the rocket's electronic "brain," many kinds of rare metals and new materials must also be used.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 10th: According to TASS, Moscow: Soviet Engineering Major Grenin recently published an article in the "Soviet Air Force Newspaper," saying that a turbine that drives a powerful centrifugal pump is of particular importance in solving the problem of the smooth flight of intercontinental ballistic rockets. The author estimates that some U.S. rockets explode in the first few seconds of flight, possibly due to the lack of such a reliable turbine. The article stated that intercontinental ballistic rockets use liquid-fueled jet engines. The combustion process inside this type of engine is extremely violent. In order to prevent the walls of the combustion chamber and nozzle from melting at high temperatures, the liquid fuel must flow along the outer surface of the walls of the combustion chamber and nozzle to cool them. When the fuel cools the walls of the combustion chamber, it heats up itself, and then enters the engine in a heated state, which has a good effect on the combustion process. At the same time, the engine's fuel must be supplied by a powerful centrifugal pump. The centrifugal pump must be driven by a special turbine to ensure smooth flight.

### 苏联科学家介绍洲际火箭  箭壳材料既要耐超高温超低温又要能抗腐蚀  美国的火箭出毛病可能由于缺少一种涡轮机

　　苏联科学家介绍洲际火箭
    箭壳材料既要耐超高温超低温又要能抗腐蚀
    美国的火箭出毛病可能由于缺少一种涡轮机
    新华社莫斯科10日电　苏联技术科学副博士、工程少校帕尔费诺夫最近在“苏联空军报”上发表文章，谈科学家在制造洲际弹道火箭时所要解决的一些迫切的技术问题，并且介绍了各种能耐超高温、超低温、抗腐蚀的坚固材料。
    文章说，在洲际火箭重新回到大气层进入路线最后一段的时候，火箭外壳头部的温度可能达到五千度。即使采用了冷却和减低速度的办法，制造火箭的材料仍然是极迫切的问题。
    文章在分析了钨、铼、钼、铌等金属在火箭制造方面的价值后指出，甚至最难熔和最耐火的金属也不能最后解决火箭外壳材料问题。再过几年，稀有“奇异”金属的时代即将成为过去，耐火陶土和金属陶土的时代即将到来。
    文章说，陶土是极难熔的，但是太脆，受不起震动和打击。为了提高其延展性，在陶土中混入10％到20％的金属钴粉。然后把混合料加热到很高的温度。这样制成的整块的、经过焙烧的混合物就叫金属陶土。这种物质不仅可以用来制造火箭外壳，而且可以用来覆盖在喷嘴上。
    文章指出，燃烧室中喷出的气流温度高达三千度。冷却燃烧室和喷嘴是极复杂的问题。这个问题现在已经成功地解决了。解决方法之一是制造“发汗”壁。液体在巨大压力下从需要冷却的燃烧室和喷嘴的有许多细孔的壁上渗出。这些小水滴立即蒸发，从壁上带走大量的热。
    文章说，在火箭上的液态氧储存库中，温度几乎低到零下二百度，普通金属和合金在这种超低温中会变得像玻璃一样脆，完全不适合用作制造储存库的材料。必需要在高度真空条件下制造一种具有高度延展性合金。有时氧气储存库的壁不用金属合金，而用特种塑料——氟碳化合物来制造。有时火箭用浓硝酸来作氧化剂。浓硝酸性质极烈，能毁坏许多金属。它的储存库以及把它送入燃烧室的管子，是用塑料制成的，然而制造压缩和喷射器械的零件必需要有不仅具有化学稳定性、而且还有足够坚固和耐磨损性能的材料。这些零件上覆盖一层钽可以解决这一问题。
    文章指出，在制造构成火箭电“脑”的、极复杂的自动装置和无线电装置中，也要使用许多种稀有金属和新物质。
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联工程少校格列宁最近在“苏联空军报”上发表文章说，在解决洲际弹道火箭顺利飞行的问题中，一种带动强大离心泵的涡轮机具有特别重大的意义。作者估计，美国的一些火箭在飞行的最初几秒钟就爆炸，可能就是由于缺少这种可靠的涡轮机。文章说，洲际弹道火箭采用的是液体燃料喷气发动机。这种发动机内燃烧过程进行得极其猛烈。为了避免燃烧室和喷嘴的壁在高温中熔化，要使液体燃料沿燃烧室和喷嘴的壁的外表流过，以进行冷却。燃料在冷却燃烧室的壁的时候，本身即行加热，然后再以经过加热的状态进入发动机内，这对燃烧过程有良好的作用。同时，发动机的燃料要用一种强大的离心泵来供应。离心泵要用一种特制的涡轮机来带动，这样才能保证飞行顺利。
