Comrade Chairman, Comrade Foreign Delegates, Delegates to the Congress!

On behalf of the one million working people of Chile, I extend my deepest congratulations to our brothers, the Chinese workers, on the occasion of the Eighth National Congress of Trade Unions of China.

The United Workers' Confederation of Chile, uniting a vast number of workers, staff, and peasants, could not be without a representative at this great congress convened by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. I am honored to have been chosen as the representative of the United Workers' Confederation of Chile, to come and directly and vividly absorb the rich experience of the Chinese revolution and the creative construction of the Chinese working class. The Chinese working class, on the ashes of a decadent and barbarous feudal system, has established with extreme speed a vibrant, powerful, and peace-loving New China, whose basic purpose is for the benefit and happiness of the working people.

Comrade Delegates, the working people of Chile, like the working people of other Latin American countries, have been engaged in a serious struggle to secure a guaranteed standard of living, to defend the freedoms of the people and to defend trade union rights, and to safeguard the sovereignty and national independence which is still being trampled upon by U.S. imperialism.

The U.S. imperialist monopolists, with the support of cruel despotic regimes and servile, corrupt governments, are pursuing a policy of systematically plundering our country's main resources, bringing to our countries acute economic crises, intensifying the exploitation of workers, and increasing their hunger, poverty and unemployment.

The Chilean government shamelessly hired a so-called American economic expert delegation, fostered by Mr. Roy Groves, a big copper mine boss. This delegation, under the slogan of fighting inflation, drafted a general economic plan. During the three years of implementation, this economic plan has only meant wage cuts, an increase in the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed, and the selling of new wealth to the greedy U.S. imperialist monopolists.

The policy carried out with blood and fire by General Ibáñez's government has been opposed by the working class from the beginning. The result of this policy is that workers' wages have continuously declined in the past two years, and workers are currently waging a difficult struggle to prevent further wage cuts. In the past two years, workers' wages have been reduced by more than 210 billion pesos; on the other hand, the purchasing power of wages and salaries has significantly decreased due to the continuous rise in the prices of food, clothing, and rent. The cost of living has risen by 117% in the past two years. Coupled with the increase in unemployment, the situation of the workers has become even more serious. For example, small and medium-sized mines have almost completely shut down, leaving thousands of families in a state of starvation; 40% of the construction industry has stopped work, 30% of metallurgical workers and textile workers are unemployed, and the rest only work three days a week and receive only half their wages.

Taking advantage of the deepening economic crisis and the increasing number of unemployed workers, domestic and foreign capitalists, with the support of the government and its repressive instruments such as the police, have intensified the exploitation of workers, reduced wages, cut down on employed workers, increased labor intensity, and vigorously used cheap labor to extract maximum profits.

Since the policy of planned plunder and oppression weighs heavily on the shoulders of urban and rural workers, and since this situation also affects other sectors of the population, such as the fact that commercial sales have decreased by almost half and a large proportion of small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen have gone bankrupt, even losing their entire fortunes, can it be said that the anti-national interests policy implemented by imperialism is only harming the working masses?

Due to the implementation of this pro-imperialist and fatal policy, big bankers, landlords who occupy 80% of cultivated land, and especially the large U.S. monopolists who control the exploitation of copper, iron, and nitrate mines and electric power enterprises, have made huge profits. Anaconda Copper Mining Company, which controls copper production and the trade of copper in the capitalist market, doubled its profits last year compared to previous years.

But, Comrade Delegates, the greed of imperialism is endless, and in order to seize new wealth, they have recently launched a frenzied offensive. The government, as a faithful tool for implementing their plans, has hastily handed over wealth to them. Currently, the United Workers' Confederation of Chile, united with the forces of the people, is mobilizing nationwide to launch a struggle to raise wages and oppose the passage of three draft laws. These three draft laws attempt to hand over the operation of all coastal ports, oil wells, and new electricity resources to the control of the United States.

However, the Chilean working class is not prepared to give up the wealth of its country. It calls on all democratic forces to launch a broad national movement in order to resist the sale of our country's wealth through mass struggles, to reclaim the control of raw materials that are still in the hands of imperialism today, and to establish an independent government that is not controlled by U.S. monopoly capitalists, thereby guaranteeing a broad democratic life and freely establishing friendly diplomatic and trade relations with all countries in the world, especially with socialist countries.

Finally, on behalf of the United Workers' Confederation of Chile, I extend my warmest congratulations to this significant congress, wishing the congress success, and wishing the friendly relations between the workers of Chile and China and the working people of the world to become closer and their unity to become more solid.

### 智利工人统一工会全国组织书记  路易斯·菲盖罗阿致词

    智利工人统一工会全国组织书记
    路易斯·菲盖罗阿致词主席同志、外国代表同志们、大会代表同志们！
    我谨代表智利一百万劳动人民，以深厚的感情向我们的兄弟——中国工人们的工会第八次代表大会祝贺。
    智利工人统一工会团结了广大工人、职员和农民，它不能没有代表参加中华全国总工会召开的这一伟大的代表大会。我很荣幸地被推选为智利工人统一工会的代表，前来直接地和生动地吸取中国革命和中国工人阶级创造性建设的丰富经验。中国工人阶级在腐朽野蛮的封建制度的灰烬上，以极快的速度建立了一个充满活力的、强大的和爱好和平的新中国，它的基本目的是为了劳动人民的利益和幸福。
    代表同志们，智利的劳动人民，像拉丁美洲其他各国的劳动人民一样，一直在进行着严重的斗争，为争取保障生活水平，维护人民的自由和保卫工会权利而斗争，为维护仍然受着美帝国主义践踏的主权和民族独立而斗争。
    美帝国主义垄断资本家在残酷的专制制度和奴颜婢膝的腐败政府的支持下，执行着有计划地掠夺我国主要资源的政策，给我们这些国家带来了尖锐的经济危机，加重了对劳动者的剥削，增加了他们的饥饿、贫穷和失业。
    智利政府恬不知耻地聘用了一个由铜矿大老板罗依·格罗佛斯先生所豢养的所谓美国经济专家代表团，这个代表团，在反对通货膨胀的口号下，拟订了一个总的经济计划。在三年的执行过程中，这个经济计划只意味着工资的下降，失业和半失业人数的增长，以及把新的财富出卖给贪欲的美帝国主义垄断资本家。
    伊巴涅斯将军的政府用鲜血和烈火执行的这个政策，一开始就遭到工人阶级的反对。这个政策执行的结果是，工人的工资在两年内连续下降，目前工人正在展开艰巨的斗争，以便防止工资再次降低。最近二年来，工人们的工资已经减少了二千一百多亿比索；另一方面，由于衣食用品和房租不断上涨，工资和薪金的购买力显著下降。近二年来生活费用已经上涨了117％。加之，失业人数的增加，劳动者的处境就愈加严重了。譬如中小矿业几乎全部停工，使成千上万的家庭处于饥饿状态；40％的建筑业停工，30％的冶金工人和纺织工人失业，其余的人每周仅工作三天，只拿到一半工资。
    利用经济危机的加深和工人失业人数的日益增加，国内外的资本家在政府及其警察机构等镇压工具的支持下，加强了对劳动者的剥削，降低工资，削减在业工人，增加劳动强度，并大力利用廉价劳动力榨取最大的利润。
    既然有计划掠夺和压迫的政策沉重地压在城乡劳动者的肩上，既然这种情况也影响了其他阶层的人民，例如商业销售量几乎减少了一半，很大一部分中小工商业家都遭到破产，甚至倾家荡产，那么，难道可以说帝国主义执行的反民族利益的政策仅仅损害着劳动群众吗？
    由于执行了这个亲帝国主义的致命的政策，大银行资本家，占有耕地80％的地主，特别是控制铜、铁、硝石矿的开采和电力企业的美国大垄断资本家，大赚其钱。控制着铜的生产和在资本主义市场上控制铜的贸易的安那康达铜矿公司，去年的利润就比往年增加了一倍。
    但是，代表同志们，帝国主义的贪欲是无止境的，为了夺取新的财富，他们最近又进行了疯狂的进攻。作为执行他们计划的忠实工具——政府就急忙把财富交给他们。目前智利工人统一工会同人民力量团结在一起，正在全国范围内动员起来，展开为争取提高工资，反对通过三个法律草案的斗争。这三个草案，企图把所有的沿海港口、石油井的经营和新的电力资源都交由美国来控制。
    但是，智利工人阶级并不准备出让本国的财富。它号召一切民主力量开展一个广泛的民族运动，以便通过群众性的斗争，抵制出卖我国的财富，收回今天还在帝国主义手中的原料控制权，建立一个不受美国垄断资本家控制的独立政府，从而保障广泛的民主生活，自由地同世界各国，特别是同社会主义国家建立友好的外交和贸易关系。
    最后，我代表智利工人统一工会，向这次具有重大意义的代表大会致以最热烈的祝贺，祝大会成功，祝智利和中国工人以及全世界劳动人民之间的友好关系更加密切，团结更加巩固。
