    Three Mu Eight Fen "Thousand Jin Hemp"
    The Youth Production Team of Yanfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province, has three mu and eight fen of high-yield land that averages 1,025 jin of ramie per mu. The entire team's 25.5 mu of ramie yielded an average of 636 jin, an increase of 77% compared to last year. The members of the Youth Production Team are very keen to learn from the high-yield experiences of other regions and constantly seek advice from veteran farmers. This year, they fully adopted advanced experiences such as selecting superior varieties, double-row close planting, rational fertilization, and rational crop rotation. In terms of manure accumulation, they dug three "ten-thousand-jin pits" and accumulated a particularly large amount of river mud. They also used wet soil, river mud, and wheat straw to cover the hemp fields, overcoming more than forty days of drought, and treated insect pests five times with drugs and manual labor, ultimately ensuring a bumper harvest of ramie. ·Xinhua News Agency·

    三亩八分“千斤麻”
    浙江省萧山县岩峰农业社青年生产队，有三亩八分丰产地平均每亩产络麻一千零二十五斤，全队二十五亩半络麻产量平均六百三十六斤，比去年增产77％。青年生产队的队员都很虚心学习各地丰产经验和不断向老农请教。今年他们全部采用了选用良种、双行密植、合理施肥、合理轮作等先进经验，积肥方面挖了三个“万斤坑”，河泥也捻得特别多。他们还用湿土、河泥、麦草盖麻地战胜了四十多天的干旱，用药物和人工治了五次虫害，最后保证了络麻丰收。·新华社·
