Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 25th: The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has, in the past two weeks, conducted an in-depth inspection of the rectification work of the first and second batches of rectification units in the city. The Municipal Party Committee requires leading cadres of all units to, with revolutionary spirit, mobilize and rely on the masses to quickly launch a citywide upsurge in rectification.

According to the inspection, since the units participating in the first and second batches of rectification in Tianjin entered the stage of focusing on rectification in mid-October, they have achieved great results. Most leading cadres and some middle-level cadres in most units have conducted public self-criticisms based on the criticisms raised by the masses. The self-criticisms of most leading cadres were relatively profound and were welcomed by the masses. Through rectification, the relationship between leaders and those led, and the relationship between the Party and the masses, have been significantly improved in many units. Party members of the Dongya Wool and Linen Textile Factory have strengthened the close ties between the Party and the masses by visiting homes and engaging in individual conversations. More than 39,000 cadres have been transferred to lower levels in the city. According to statistics, nearly 30% of the units have now addressed 80% to 90% of the opinions raised by the masses; more than 50% of the units have addressed 60% to 70% of the opinions raised by the masses. Units with faster progress in rectification work have begun to show a vigorous new atmosphere, and a new production upsurge is gradually forming.

The Municipal Party Committee also found many problems in the current rectification work during the inspection. First, the leaders of some units are not determined enough to rectify, they do not rectify thoroughly, and work is not progressing quickly enough. Although most units have solved many problems, most of them are dealt with on a case-by-case basis, and many major key problems have not been resolved. About 20% of the units have only addressed 10% to 30% of the opinions raised by the masses. Second, some units have not fully expressed their opinions, and a few backward units have not even truly launched a wave of free airing of views, and many problems have not been exposed. The Tianjin Municipal Party Committee and the district committees have criticized these units for their slow progress or perfunctory approach to rectification work. For individual units with more serious problems, relevant departments have also formed special groups to conduct inspections.

Based on the inspection results, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of Party member cadres on the 24th to mobilize all units to deepen the rectification work and called on units with slow progress to catch up with the advanced units with a revolutionary spirit and launch an upsurge in rectification. Wan Xiaotang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Municipal Party Committee, pointed out at the meeting: At present, the units that have rectified well are still a minority, and most units have not rectified enough. Wan Xiaotang said that the main reasons for the slow progress of rectification work in many units are due to the following erroneous thoughts and attitudes among some leading cadres: (1) Some leading cadres in some units have a "good enough" mentality and lack the determination to carry out rectification boldly, resolutely, and thoroughly. They simply calculate the percentage of problems solved, and after picking up some sesame seeds, they become complacent and slack off. (2) Dealing with rectification with a bureaucratic attitude. Failing to deeply analyze and study the opinions of the masses, and lacking a clear understanding; failing to investigate the root causes of the problems, and failing to fundamentally study ways to improve, and dealing with things perfunctorily; some leading cadres in some units also researched improvement plans behind closed doors, without following the mass line. (3) A few leading cadres dare not face their own shortcomings, and do not humbly accept the correct criticisms of the masses. Some are afraid of "getting burned" and even harbor resistance. (4) Some leading cadres take a liberal attitude towards the shortcomings and mistakes of their colleagues and subordinates, and dare not carry out criticism; some leading cadres in some units are not united, but have no determination to correct this in the rectification, which seriously affects the progress of the rectification. (5) Many units have a waiting mentality, relying on higher levels to solve problems.

Wan Xiaotang pointed out that a few units with faster progress should deepen and thoroughly investigate the rectification work and rectify it thoroughly. Most units should quickly solve general problems, turn to special rectification, and solve major key problems. For a few backward units, higher-level leading organs should strengthen specific leadership, boldly mobilize the masses, and rely on the supervision and inspection of leaders and the supervision of the masses to quickly reverse the situation of slow progress in rectification.

    天津市委检查全市整改工作
    改得好的单位出现朝气蓬勃的新气象
    多数单位改得不够需要迅速迎头赶上
    据新华社天津25日电　中共天津市委员会在最近两周内深入检查了全市第一、二批整风单位的整改工作。市委要求各单位领导干部以革命的精神，发动和依靠群众，在全市范围内迅速掀起整改的高潮。
    据检查，天津市参加第一、二批整风的单位在10月中旬转入着重整改阶段以来，已经取得很大成绩。大多数单位的领导干部和一部分中层干部，根据群众提出的批评，公开进行了检查，多数领导干部的检查比较深刻，受到群众的欢迎。通过整风，不少单位领导人与被领导人之间的关系、党群关系都有了显著的改进。东亚毛麻纺织厂党员用登门造访、个别谈心等方式，加强了党和群众的亲密联系。全市目前下放的干部已经有三万九千多人。据统计，目前有近30％的单位已处理了群众所提意见的80％到90％；约有50％以上的单位已经处理了群众所提意见的60％到70％。整改工作进展较快的单位开始出现了朝气蓬勃的新气象，一个新的生产高潮正在逐步形成中。
    市委在检查中还发现当前整改工作中存在不少问题。首先是部分单位的领导人员整改决心不大，改得不狠，工作进展不快。目前多数单位虽然也解决了不少问题，但大多数是就事论事，许多重大的关键问题还没有得到解决。还有约20％的单位，只处理了群众所提意见的10％到30％。其次，有些单位鸣放得不深不透，少数落后的单位甚至还没有真正掀起鸣放热潮，许多问题还没有揭发出来。天津市委及各区委对这些整改工作进展迟缓或者草率从事的单位提出了批评，对个别问题比较严重的单位，还由有关部门组成专门小组进行检查。
    中共天津市委根据检查结果在24日召开了党员干部会议，动员各单位把整改工作深入一步，号召进展迟缓的单位以革命的精神，迅速赶上先行单位，掀起整改高潮。市委书记处书记万晓塘在会上指出：目前改得好的单位还是少数，多数单位还改得不够。万晓塘说，许多单位整改工作进展迟缓的主要原因，是由于在一部分领导干部中存在以下几种错误的思想和态度：（一）有些单位领导干部存在“差不多”的思想，缺乏大胆地、坚决地、彻底地进行整改的决心，单纯计算解决问题的百分比，在拣了一些芝麻以后，便骄傲自满，松懈下来。（二）用官僚主义态度对待整改。不深入分析研究群众的意见，心中无数；不追查问题产生的根源，不从根本上研究改进办法，敷衍了事；还有的单位领导干部关门研究改进方案，不走群众路线。（三）少数领导干部不敢正视自己的缺点，不虚心接受群众的正确批评，有的害怕“引火烧身”，甚至存有抵触情绪。（四）有些领导干部对同级和下级干部的缺点和错误，采取自由主义的态度，不敢展开批评；有些单位领导干部之间不团结，但没有决心在整风中改正，严重地影响整改的进行。（五）不少单位存在着依赖上级解决问题的等待思想。
    万晓塘指出：少数进展较快的单位，应该使整改工作搞深搞透，改得彻底。多数单位应该把一般问题迅速加以解决，转入专题整改，解决重大的关键性问题。对少数落后单位，上级领导机关应加强具体领导，放手发动群众，依靠领导的督促检查和群众的监督，迅速扭转整改进展迟缓的状况。
