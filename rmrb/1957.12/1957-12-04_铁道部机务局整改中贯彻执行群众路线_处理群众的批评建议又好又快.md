　　The Locomotive Bureau of the Ministry of Railways Implements the Mass Line in Rectification
　　Handling Mass Criticism and Suggestions Well and Quickly

　　(Our Dispatch) The Locomotive Bureau of the Ministry of Railways has achieved significant results by vigorously carrying out rectification using the mass line method. As of November 30th, the bureau had processed 983 of the 1,164 opinions put forward by the masses during the airing of views, accounting for 84.4% of the total opinions, and had basically ensured quality.

　　In the past, although the rectification leading group of the Locomotive Bureau also paid attention to rectifying while correcting, and mobilized all the masses to participate in handling various opinions, it did not fully utilize the collective strength of the masses due to insufficient "movement" methods, and mostly used the conventional method of proposals by supervisors, review by section chiefs, and approval by bureau leaders. This affected the speed and quality of rectification. In the handling plans proposed by various sections, there were shortcomings such as incorrect handling, incompleteness, irrelevant answers, and harsh attitudes. For example, when the Repair Section responded to the masses' suggestion to formulate wheelset (carriage wheel) management methods, the supervisor did not understand the original meaning of the opinion and replied that the management methods were already stipulated in the repair regulations. In fact, the person making the suggestion was referring to the management and allocation of spare wheels, not the repair of existing wheels on locomotives. Because the reply was not discussed by the masses, the head of the section did not notice it. This not only caused dissatisfaction among those who made suggestions, but also hindered future work improvements.

　　After listening to the instructions of the Central State Organs Party Committee on vigorously carrying out rectification using the mass line on November 22nd, the rectification leading group of the Locomotive Bureau reviewed the bureau's rectification work and decided to change the past approach from November 23rd, adopting a method that fully utilized the collective strength of the masses, combining leadership with the masses, and collective discussion with individual responsibility. They reclassified all criticisms and suggestions according to business, nature, and scope of work, and established six specialized groups to be responsible for reviewing the issues handled by each section and office. These six groups were responsible for handling problems within their respective areas; each group was composed of leading cadres above the section level. After the specialized groups were established, the opinions put forward by the masses during the airing of views were assigned to each section and office. First, the supervisors proposed handling opinions, which were discussed among the masses in the section and office, and the leaders of the section and office signed and took responsibility, and then submitted to the specialized group for collective review. Major issues were finally approved and announced by the director or the rectification leading group.

　　Handling opinions after discussion by the masses in the sections and offices reduced shortcomings such as incorrect, one-sided, and harsh handling, and educated the masses. Collective review by groups accelerated the progress and basically ensured quality. For example, when the Operation Section responded to the masses' opinion to change the locomotive assigned crew system to a rotating crew system, the section simply replied: The assigned crew system is a kind of socialist superior system and cannot be changed. This reply obviously could not solve the problem well. Later, after discussion within the section, the reply was supplemented from three aspects on why the assigned crew system should not be changed, and the reply became more substantial and reasonable. In the past, nine responses to mass opinions by the Operation Section were repeatedly returned by the bureau leadership team due to improper handling. Since adopting the mass line method, of the nearly one hundred opinions handled, only one was returned for reprocessing due to improper procedures.

　　Due to the full use of the mass line and mass movement methods, the speed of rectification in the Locomotive Bureau has also improved compared to the past. In the past, because only a few people reviewed the rectification opinions, progress was very slow. The bureau affairs meeting could only handle about twenty items in half a day. Now, the bureau leaders and the groups handling the issues can handle an average of seventy or eighty items per day. During the rectification upsurge, from November 23rd to 30th, the opinions handled in eight days were nine times faster than the eight days from November 14th to 22nd before the upsurge.

　　The current mass line approach adopted by the Locomotive Bureau in rectification has changed the situation in which a few people were tense and overburdened in the rectification work, making everyone more concerned about the rectification work, everyone responsible for the rectification work, and everyone receiving specific education in the rectification. This is of great benefit to raising the awareness of the masses, increasing their sense of ownership in their work, and improving future work.

### 铁道部机务局整改中贯彻执行群众路线　处理群众的批评建议又好又快

　　铁道部机务局整改中贯彻执行群众路线
　　处理群众的批评建议又好又快
    本报讯　铁道部机务局采取群众路线方法大力进行整改，已经获得显著效果。截至11月30日为止，全局对群众在鸣放中所提出的一千一百六十四条意见，已经处理九百八十三条，占意见总数的84.4％，并基本上保证了质量。
    过去一个时期，机务局整风领导小组虽然也注意边整边改，也曾动员全体群众参加处理各项意见，但是由于采取“运动”方式不足，多用主管人提出、科长审查、局领导批准的常规办法，没有充分发挥群众集体力量，因而影响了整改的速度和质量。在各科提出的处理方案中，出现了处理错误、不全面、答非所问、态度生硬等等缺点。如检修科答复群众提出的制订轮对（车轮）管理办法的建议时，由于主管人没有弄清意见的原意，而答复说管理办法在检修规程中已有规定。实际上，提意见的人是指的备用车轮的管理调配问题，而不是机车现有车轮的检修问题。因为答复意见没有经过群众讨论，科的负责人也没有发现。这样，不仅引起提意见人的不满，也妨害今后工作的改进。
    机务局整风领导小组在11月22日听取了中央国家机关党委关于采用群众路线大力进行整改的传达指示以后，对局的整改工作进行了检查，并决定从11月23日起，改变过去的方式，采取了充分运用群众集体力量，使领导与群众结合、集体讨论与个人负责结合的方法。他们把所有的批评意见和建议，按业务、性质和工作范围重新进行分类，成立了六个专门小组，负责审核各科、室处理的问题。这六个小组负责分片处理本范围的问题；每个小组都由科以上的领导干部组成。专门小组成立以后，就把群众在鸣放中所提出的意见，分交各科、室，先由主管人提出处理意见，在本科、室群众中进行讨论，由科、室领导人签字负责，再交分片的专门小组集体审查，其中重大问题最后由局长或整风领导小组批准公布。
    处理意见经过科、室群众讨论，减少了处理错误、片面和生硬等缺点，并使群众得到教育。经过分片集体审查，加速了进度也基本上保证了质量。如运用科在答复群众提出的机车包乘制改为轮乘制的意见时，科内只简单答复：包乘制是社会主义优越制度的一种，不能改变。这种答复显然不能很好地解决问题，后来经科内讨论后，从三个方面补充了包乘制不宜改变的道理，答复就变得充实而合理。运用科在过去对群众意见的答复，由于处理不当而连续被局领导小组退回的有九件，自从改用群众路线的方法以后，所处理的近百条意见，仅有一件是由于手续不合而退回重新处理。
    由于充分运用群众路线和群众运动的方法，机务局的整改速度也较过去有了提高。在过去一段时间，因为只是少数人审核整改意见，进度很慢。局务会议审核，半天只能处理二十来条。现在局领导和分片处理的平均每天七、八十条。在整改高潮中，自11月23日至30日，八天所处理的意见，比高潮前11月14日至22日的八天，处理速度加快了九倍。
    机务局在整改中采取现行的群众路线的作法，改变了在整改工作中少数人紧张和负担过重的现象，使得人人更关心整改工作，人人都对整改工作负有责任，人人在整改中受到具体的教育。这对提高群众觉悟，增加对工作的主人翁感和改进以后的工作都有很大好处。
