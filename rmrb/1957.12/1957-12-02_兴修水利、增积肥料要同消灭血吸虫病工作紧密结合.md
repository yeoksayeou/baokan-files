Combine Water Conservancy Construction and Fertilizer Accumulation with the Elimination of Schistosomiasis

People's Daily Commentator

Currently, a large-scale mass movement of water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation is being launched one after another throughout the country, striving for a large increase in agricultural production in the future. In the vast areas of China where schistosomiasis is prevalent, eliminating schistosomiasis, which seriously endangers people's health and hinders agricultural production, is an important condition for achieving increased agricultural production. Therefore, closely combining the main measures for increasing agricultural production—water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation—with the major measures for preventing schistosomiasis—eliminating snails and managing manure—is an important task in schistosomiasis-endemic areas at present. The millions of labor armies organized in various places are currently engaged in large-scale water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation movements. In the vast areas where schistosomiasis has not yet been eliminated, this movement should be closely integrated in a planned way to meet the requirements of eliminating snails and managing manure to kill schistosomiasis eggs.

The prevention and control of schistosomiasis must be combined with the development of agricultural production and water conservancy construction. This has been affirmed at the Third National Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control Conference and in the instructions of the State Council, and it is also a basic experience summarized in practice over the past few years. Actual work in recent years has repeatedly proved that areas that have done this have achieved good results. For example, when Wujin County, Jiangsu Province, dredged the Lao Meng River, it combined the elimination of snails on a 37-mile long section, which not only made both tasks meet the requirements, but also saved about 30,000 workdays. When Fengxian County dredged the Lengjing Port and Santuan Port projects in the spring of this year, it also combined the elimination of snails. A re-examination in September this year proved that the snail density has dropped from the original 30 per square foot to 0.3, which is better than the effect of other snail elimination methods. Another example is Yujiang County, Jiangxi Province, which combined the adjustment of the farmland irrigation system last spring, and adopted the method of filling old ditches and opening new ditches, filling 243 old ditches and opening 78 new ditches, with a total length of more than 330 miles. In August this year, 122 ditches were inspected, and only 14 snails were found in three ditches, and the density has dropped to 0.003. Moreover, the irrigation system has become more rational and applicable, and nearly 2,000 acres of cultivated land have been added. The Dongxihu land reclamation project in Hubei Province, which has already started construction, will not only eliminate snails in an area of 4.8 million square kilometers after completion, but also reclaim 400,000 acres of fertile land. In short, these three things—building water conservancy, eliminating snails, and digging river mud—can be done together and achieve multiple gains. The effect of combining fertilizer accumulation with manure management is also very obvious. Where manure is well managed, not only are schistosomiasis eggs killed and the snail positivity rate is reduced, but also the amount of manure fertilizer is greatly increased and the quality is also improved. At the same time, maggots and flies are also killed, environmental hygiene is improved, and infectious diseases of the human gastrointestinal system are reduced. Therefore, the masses call manure management a good method of "increasing crop production and prolonging life." For example, after one year of manure management in Heping Agricultural Cooperative in Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, the snail positivity rate dropped from the original 1.99% to 0.1%; the number of people suffering from infectious diseases of the gastrointestinal system dropped from 10.61% of the population to 3.54%, and nearly 13,000 dan of manure fertilizer were added.

However, some people say: "It is too troublesome to combine the two tasks, and it does not conform to the principle of diligence and thrift in running water conservancy," "Combining them is an extra burden and helping others." These statements are obviously one-sided and wrong. Of course, it is indeed more troublesome to combine the two tasks than to do one thing alone. For example, if water conservancy construction is to be combined with the elimination of snails, it is necessary to increase the amount of earthwork and add an operation. If fertilizer accumulation is to be combined with manure management and sealing to kill eggs, it is necessary to use manure fertilizer in an organized and planned way, and it cannot be used indiscriminately. But these are just some minor troubles, and what these minor troubles bring are unparalleled benefits. On the contrary, if we are afraid of these minor troubles today, and in areas where snails are distributed, we do not combine water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation with the elimination of snails and manure management, there is a risk that the snails will move with the excavation of a large amount of earthwork, so as to expand the epidemic area; there is a risk that the insect eggs in the manure will hatch in the water and expand the infection. If we start from scratch again after the water conservancy project is completed and shovel soil to eliminate snails, it will not only cost money, but also affect the quality and life of the completed water conservancy project. The result will really bring big troubles. Obviously, combining water conservancy construction to eliminate snails and combining fertilizer accumulation to manage manure well is a good thing that saves labor, saves money, and is greatly beneficial to the people. It not only does not violate, but also completely conforms to the principle of building the country with diligence and thrift.

Combining water conservancy construction with the elimination of snails and combining fertilizer accumulation with manure management is a mass work with certain technical requirements. Therefore, to truly combine these two tasks well, it is necessary to do a lot of careful organizational work and ideological education work. It is necessary to repeatedly educate cadres and the masses to explain the advantages and disadvantages of combining and separating the two. The elimination of snails should be included in the water conservancy construction plans of the provinces (cities), prefectures, and counties for unified planning, and the required labor and earthwork should also be calculated and arranged together. Leadership should be unified in the work. Before construction, the distribution of snails in the construction area should be investigated and mapped, and the construction methods and operating procedures should be determined. Each project should arrange the order of snail elimination and river opening according to the engineering quality requirements and snail elimination effect requirements. During construction, it can be contracted by village, cooperative, and team in sections, ensuring construction and snail elimination, and ensuring quality and quantity. Water conservancy and prevention cadres participating in the construction should work under the unified leadership of the water conservancy department to prevent the phenomenon of each emphasizing their own work and being disjointed. Technical guidance should be strengthened from beginning to end. Cadres and masses without practical experience should be guided through practical operation and typical demonstration to ensure the quality of the project and the effect of snail elimination. At the same time, attention should be paid to doing a good job in various safety protection work to protect migrant workers from schistosomiasis infection. After the completion, a unified acceptance should be implemented, not only to check whether the water conservancy project is qualified, but also to ensure that the snail elimination meets the standard requirements. If there are omissions and incomplete places, "make-up lessons" should be given immediately, to meet the requirement of "thoroughly eliminating harm".

In the combination of fertilizer accumulation and manure management, cadres and the masses should also be made to understand its benefits, so that they know that doing so can increase manure fertilizer, can effectively kill insect eggs, and that regular sealing to kill insect eggs is also a scientific method to improve fertilizer efficiency. At the same time, it can also eliminate flies, improve environmental sanitation, reduce disease transmission, and promote people's health. At present, the effective method of manure management is small-scale centralized manure tanks with special personnel management. Centralization is a necessary condition for good management and persistence. With special personnel management, it is possible to seal on time. When carrying out this work, the cooperative members' manure entering the cooperative and the use of fertilizer in private plots should be properly handled. The price of manure entering the cooperative must be reasonable. The collection of wild manure and animal manure should be encouraged to open up fertilizer sources and reduce the opportunity for sewage sources to be contaminated. The managed manure should be sealed regularly to kill eggs, and fertilizer should be used in a planned way. Fertilizer for production should be planned according to the time of fertilizer use, and preparations should be made in advance to avoid affecting fertilizer use for production due to regular sealing, or destroying regular sealing due to fertilizer use for production. These are all things that need attention.

The mass movements of water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation in various places have already started one after another, so time is very tight. The relevant departments in various places should immediately and quickly deploy the work of combining the elimination of snails and take active actions. If we miss this good opportunity, we will cause irreparable losses.

　　兴修水利、增积肥料要同消灭血吸虫病工作紧密结合
　　本报评论员
    目前，全国各地正在先后展开一个大规模的兴修水利和积肥的群众运动，争取今后农业的大增产。而在我国血吸虫病流行的广大地区，消灭危害人民健康、妨碍农业生产最严重的血吸虫病，却又是实现农业增产的一个重要条件，因此，紧密地把农业增产的主要措施兴修水利、增积肥料和预防血吸虫病的重大措施消灭钉螺、管理粪便结合起来进行，是当前血吸虫病流行地区的一项重要任务。目前各地组织起来的数以百万计的劳动大军，正在进行着大规模的兴修水利和积肥的运动。在广大血吸虫病还未消灭的地区，应该有计划地密切地结合这一运动来达到消灭钉螺和管理粪便杀灭血吸虫卵的要求。
    血吸虫病的防治工作必须和发展农业生产、兴修水利相结合，这是在第三次全国血吸虫病防治会议上和国务院的指示中已经肯定了的，也是几年来实践中总结出来的一条基本经验。几年来的实际工作也已一再证明，凡是这样做了的地区，都收到了很好的效果，如江苏省武进县在疏浚老孟河的时候，在全长三十七华里的地段上，结合了消灭钉螺工作，不仅两项工作都做得合乎要求，并且还节省了约三万多个工作日。奉贤县在今年春季疏浚冷泾港、四团港的工程时，也结合了消灭钉螺工作，今年9月进行了一次复查，证明钉螺密度已由原来每平方市尺三十只降到零点三只，比采用其它灭螺方法的效果好。又如江西省余江县去年春季结合调整农田灌溉系统，先后采用填旧沟开新沟的办法，填平旧沟二百四十三条，开新沟七十八条，共长三百三十余里，今年8月检查了一百二十二条沟，只在三条沟中发现了十四只钉螺，密度已降至零点零零三只，而且使灌溉系统更加合理、适用，同时还增加了近两千亩耕地面积。湖北省已开始施工的东西湖围垦工程，完工后，不仅可在四百八十万平方公里的面积上消灭钉螺，还开垦出四十万亩良田。总之，修水利、灭钉螺、挖河泥这三件事是完全可以一举两得、一齐做好的。积肥同粪便管理结合起来，效果也很明显，凡是粪便管理得好的地方，不仅杀灭了血吸虫卵，钉螺阳性率有了降低；而且粪肥数量有了很大的增加，质量也有了提高。同时还杀灭了蛆蝇；改善了环境卫生；减少了人们肠胃系统的传染病。所以群众对管理粪便工作，称之谓“田增产、人增寿”的好办法。如湖北省孝感县和平农业社经过一年的粪便管理，结果钉螺阳性率由原来的1.99％降低到0.1％；患肠胃系统传染病的人由占人口10.61％，下降到3.54％，还增加了粪肥近一万三千担。
    但是也有人说：“两件事结合在一起进行太麻烦，而且不合乎勤俭办水利的原则”，“结合进行是额外负担、替人家帮忙”。这些说法，显然是片面的和错误的。当然，把两件工作结合起来做，确实要比单纯干一件事麻烦一些，譬如兴修水利如果要结合消灭钉螺，就要增加一点土方，增多一道操作。积肥如果要和管理粪便、封存杀卵结合起来，就要有组织有计划的使用粪肥，不能随便滥用。但是这些都不过是一些小小的麻烦，这些小麻烦所换来的却是无比的好处。相反的，如果我们今天因为害怕这些小麻烦，而在有钉螺分布的地区，不把兴修水利、积肥和消灭钉螺、管理粪便工作结合起来一齐做，就有造成钉螺随着大量土方的挖掘而搬家，以致使疫区扩大的危险；就有让粪便里的虫卵下水孵化扩大感染的危险。倘若在水利工程修好以后，再重起炉灶，铲土灭钉螺，不仅费钱，而且影响到已修成的水利工程的质量和寿命。其结果会真正带来了大麻烦。显而易见，结合兴修水利消灭钉螺，结合积肥管理好粪便，就是一件省工、省钱，对人民大大有利的好事，不但不违背，而且是完全符合勤俭建国的原则的。
    兴修水利结合消灭钉螺，和积肥结合粪便管理，是一个群众性的并且还有一定技术要求的工作，因此要把这两项工作真正结合得好，就需要作许多周密的组织工作和思想教育工作，要对干部和群众反复地进行教育，说明两者结合进行和分开进行的利弊。要把消灭钉螺工作纳入省（市）、专区、县的兴修水利规划中统一规划，连所需要的劳力、土方也一起计算安排。在工作中要统一领导。施工前查清工区里钉螺的分布情况，绘制成图表，确定施工方法和操作规程。每项工程都应当根据工程质量要求和灭钉螺效果要求，安排灭钉螺和开河的工作顺序。施工的时候可以按乡、社、队分段包干，包修包灭，保质保量。参加施工的水利、防治干部，应当在水利部门统一领导下工作，以防止发生各自强调自己的工作、互相脱节的现象。自始至终要加强技术指导，对没有实际经验的干部和群众，应当通过实际操作，典型示范，以保证工程质量和灭钉螺的效果。同时应该注意做好各项安全防护工作，保护民工不感染血吸虫病。竣工以后，还要实行统一验收，不但检查水利工程是不是合格，灭钉螺也要达到标准要求，发现有遗漏不彻底的地方，应该立即“补课”。作到“除害务尽”的要求。
    在积肥和管理粪便工作的结合方面，也要使干部和群众懂得它的好处，使他们知道这样做可以增多粪肥，可以有效地杀灭虫卵，而且定期封存杀灭虫卵，也是提高肥效的一个科学方法，同时还可以消灭苍蝇，改善环境卫生，减少疾病传染，增进人民健康。目前粪便管理的有效方法是粪缸小型集中，专人管理。集中起来，是管理得好和坚持下去的必要条件。有了专人管理，才可能做到按时封存。在进行这个工作的时候，应该妥善处理社员粪便入社和自留田的用肥。粪便入社，折价必须合理。要鼓励拾野粪和畜粪，开辟肥源，减少染污水源的机会。管理起来的粪便，坚持封存杀卵，做到有计划地用肥。生产用肥应当按用肥时间作出规划，预先做好准备，以免因为定期封存而影响生产用肥，或者因为生产用肥而破坏定期封存。这些都是需要注意的。
    各地兴修水利和积肥的群众运动，目前已纷纷行动起来了，因此时间已十分紧迫，各地有关部门应当立即把结合消灭钉螺的工作迅速地布置下去，积极行动起来。我们如果错过了这个良好的时机，就将要造成难以补偿的损失。
