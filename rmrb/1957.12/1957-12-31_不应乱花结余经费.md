Reader's words:

    Don't Squander Surplus Funds
    Some schools, seeing that they have a surplus of funds this year, have begun to rush to spend money, spending money on things they shouldn't. Shandong Teachers' Training College used its year-end surplus of more than 300 yuan to purchase more than 4,000 tree seedlings. Shandong Agricultural Mechanization School also used its year-end surplus of more than 400 yuan to order tree seedlings. These two units turned their surplus funds into advance payment for goods.
    The behavior of rushing to spend money at the end of the year and not wanting to hand over the surplus funds to the national treasury not only violates the national financial system but also violates the policy of building the country and running schools diligently and thriftily. It is suggested that the above units, in conjunction with the rectification movement, examine and correct the behavior of rushing to spend money.

### 不应乱花结余经费

    不应乱花结余经费
    有些学校看到今年经费有结余，就开始抢花钱，把不该花的钱也花了。山东省教师进修学院把年终结余的三百余元，购买了四千余株树苗。山东农业机械化学校也把年终结余四百余元，订购了树苗。这两个单位把结余的经费转作预付订货款，付出去了。
    年终抢花钱，不愿把结余的经费上缴国库的行为，不仅违反国家财政制度，而且违反勤俭建国、勤俭办学校的方针。建议以上单位结合整风运动，检查和纠正抢花钱的行为。
