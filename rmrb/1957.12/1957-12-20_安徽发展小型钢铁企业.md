Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, December 19th: Anhui Province is vigorously developing local small-scale iron and steel enterprises based on the principles of utilizing local materials and local supply.

Currently under construction are two small blast furnaces in Ma'anshan and iron plants in Fanchang and Dangtu counties. Once completed, these enterprises will be able to produce 95,000 tons of pig iron annually. The Anhui Steel Plant, with an annual output of 50,000 tons of steel and steel products, is also being planned. In addition, in the Dabie Mountain area, including Yuexi, Jinzhai, and Lu'an, which are areas rich in local iron ore, 61 new and restored iron smelting blast furnaces and 28 earthen furnaces have been built this year. Due to the increase in iron smelting equipment, the province's output of local iron from January to October this year reached 10,000 tons, more than triple the total output of last year and more than triple the highest annual output before liberation (1936).

The construction of these small-scale iron and steel enterprises embodies the principle of "small investment, quick results, and large returns." The iron plant in Dangtu County, built with an investment of 400,000 yuan and producing 7,500 tons of pig iron annually, is expected to be completed and put into operation in just four months. The profits earned within five years of operation can be used to rebuild an iron plant of the same scale.

    安徽发展小型钢铁企业
    据新华社合肥19日  电安徽省根据就地取材、就地供应的原则，正在大力发展地方小型钢铁企业。
    目前已经动工兴建的有马鞍山的两座小型炼铁高炉和繁昌、当涂两县的炼铁厂，这些企业建成后每年能生产生铁九万五千吨。正在筹建的还有年产五万吨钢和钢材的安徽钢厂。此外，在大别山区的岳西、金寨、六安等土铁产区，今年也新建和恢复了六十一座炼铁高炉和二十八座地炉。由于增加了炼铁设备，今年全省1到10月份的土铁产量达到了一万吨，比去年全年的产量增加了两倍以上，超过了解放前最高年产量（1936年）的三倍多。
    这些小型钢铁企业的兴建，贯彻了“投资小、收效快、收益大”的原则，在当涂县投资四十万元兴建的年产七千五百吨生铁的炼铁厂，预计只要四个月的时间就能建成投入生产。在投入生产后的五年内所获得的利润，就能用来重建同样规模的炼铁厂。
