　　Fujian Actively Promotes Birth Control
　　More Than Two-Thirds of the Province Has Held Exhibitions
　　(Our Newspaper News) Since the beginning of this year, health departments at all levels in Fujian Province have actively promoted birth control work. Up to now, more than two-thirds of the province has held contraceptive exhibitions, educating approximately 700,000 people.
　　Through the exhibitions, the masses have realized that using scientific methods to regulate birth density and having children in a planned way to achieve the goal of "bearing one, raising one, and strengthening one" is a positive measure to protect families, women, and children. This has dispelled the erroneous ideas held by some people, such as "contraception is immoral" and "bearing sons and daughters is predetermined by fate."
　　After visiting the exhibitions, people in need of birth control have been actively purchasing contraceptives from local pharmaceutical companies. According to statistics from Fujian Provincial Pharmaceutical Company: In the first quarter of this year, the province sold only more than 77,300 pieces of various contraceptive drugs and devices; in the second quarter, it sold more than 182,200 pieces, and in the third quarter, sales reached approximately 300,000 pieces.

　　福建积极宣传节育
    全省三分之二以上地区举办过展览会
    本报讯　福建省各级卫生部门今年以来积极宣传节制生育工作。到目前为止，全省三分之二以上地区已经举办过避孕节育展览会，大约有七十万人受到教育。
    通过展览会，使群众认识到用科学方法来调节生育密度，有计划的生孩子，达到“生一个、养一个、壮一个”的目的，是保护家庭、妇女和儿童的积极措施，解除了某些群众存在的“避孕不道德”、“生男育女是命中注定”等错误思想。
    需要节育的群众参观展览会以后，纷纷向各地医药公司购买避孕用具。据福建省医药公司统计：今年第一季度全省出售各种避孕药物器具仅七万七千三百多件；第二季度就出售了十八万二千二百多件，第三季度出售约达三十万件。
