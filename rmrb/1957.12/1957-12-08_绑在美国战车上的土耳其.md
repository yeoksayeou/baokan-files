　　Turkey Tied to the American War Chariot
　　Xing Xiangchao
    The Turkish army's aggressive threats against the Syrian border, under the condemnation of Arab countries and fair-minded public opinion worldwide, have now temporarily eased. However, the war crisis has not been completely eliminated. The Turkish army has not completely withdrawn from the Syrian border, and the United States still attempts to use the Turkish army at any time to achieve its goals of aggression against Syria and Arab countries. This clearly exposes Turkey as a docile tool in the American plan to invade Middle Eastern Arab countries.
    The Turkish ruling clique's submission to American aggressive policies stems from the desire to rely on the United States to restore the prestige of the Ottoman Empire. In the dozen or so years since the war, Turkey has actively supported all of America's aggressive plans in the Middle East, not hesitating to turn its own territory into a troop deployment area and arsenal for the United States in the Middle East. In the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact, cobbled together by the United States, Turkey is a country with a large army. Turkey has a population of just over 24 million, but it has an armed force of about 500,000, most of which is the army. At the same time, Turkey is also one of the countries with the highest density of American military bases. On Turkey's 300,000 square miles of land, the United States has established many military bases, including 22 air force bases, ten naval and army bases, and many radar stations specifically for reconnaissance activities against the Soviet Union. The American Sixth Fleet frequently visits and is stationed in Turkish ports, and the B58 bombers, which the United States has not yet widely used in its own armed forces, are constantly taking off and landing at Turkish airports.
    In order to turn the entire Turkey into its military base, the United States gave Turkey a huge amount of military weapons in the years after Turkey joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Turkey received 1,300 military aircraft, 1,400 tanks, 3,500 artillery pieces and other equipment and supplies, worth nearly $2 billion, from the United States alone. In addition, the United States provided another $1 billion in "aid," most of which was also used to expand the army and maintain weapons. The United States sent military advisory groups of several thousand people to train and command Turkish troops.
    Why does the United States attach so much importance to Turkey? This is because the Turkish ruling clique is willing to submit to the American aggressive policies, and Turkey is located at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa. In the eyes of American aggressors, it can threaten the peace and security of the Soviet Union to the north, and invade the entire Middle Eastern Arab countries to the south.
    In recent years, the United States has used Turkey as a base to carry out many aggressive military activities against the Soviet Union. The United States has released balloons from Turkey many times, using high-altitude air currents to conduct military reconnaissance of the Soviet Union. The United States used its powerful radar station near Samsun on the Black Sea coast to continuously conduct reconnaissance of Soviet missile test launches. This year, the Soviet Union announced the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles and successfully launched artificial satellites twice. America's disadvantage in science and technology has been completely exposed. This makes Turkey an even more important position in the American aggression plan. According to Western newspapers, the only missile that the United States has successfully tested so far is the "Redstone" type, with a range of only 700 kilometers. This type of missile cannot reach Soviet territory when launched from bases controlled by the United States in other countries. The United States wants to use Turkey as a base for launching its rockets. Admiral Robert Briscoe, commander of the Southern European forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, announced on November 12 that the United States "has made a proposal to Turkey to provide missiles," which confirms the information revealed by the Western newspapers.
    However, the Soviet Union has defensive capabilities that are far stronger than the American aggressive forces. Even the American ruling class must now admit this. Therefore, although the United States waves the banner of anti-Sovietism and makes all kinds of gestures threatening the peace and security of the Soviet Union, anyone with a slightly sober mind will know that the United States does not have the power to launch a war of aggression against the Soviet Union from Turkey. The real purpose of the United States in supporting the Turkish military force is obviously to deal with the national independence movements of the Middle Eastern Arab countries. The facts of recent years have also shown that in order to invade Arab countries and promote the so-called Eisenhower Doctrine in the Middle East, the United States has constantly created tension in the Middle East, using Turkey and Israel to threaten Arab countries. After Syria cracked the American-planned subversion plot in August of this year, Henderson, an American expert on Middle Eastern aggression, immediately visited Turkey, and then the Turkish army concentrated on the Syrian border, attempting to provoke a war of aggression against Syria. This clearly shows what role Turkey played in the American aggression plan. In this military threat, the United States even directly commanded the movements of the Turkish army. American troops are stationed in Nusaybin and Gaziantep, which are close to the Syrian border in Turkey. Helicopters painted with American markings travel frequently and often violate Syrian airspace.
    The United States is building military bases and arming the Turkish army on such a large scale because it wants to use Turkey's cheap labor and cheap cannon fodder to pull chestnuts out of the fire for it. According to Western journalists, each Turkish infantryman receives only six to twelve cents in American dollars per month; the total allowance for all Turkish soldiers for a year is not even enough to buy an American heavy military aircraft. Even in the Korean War, the total cost of a Turkish soldier was less than one-fifth of that of an American soldier.
    However, for Turkey, restoring the old prestige of the Ottoman Empire is just a dream that can never be realized. The result of its submission to American policy has brought profound disasters to the Turkish nation. Not to mention the loss of national sovereignty, the burden of military expenditure alone has made Turkey gasp for breath. Although the United States supplies Turkey with a large number of heavy military equipment such as airplanes and tanks, the costs of maintenance, repair, and fuel for this equipment are still borne by the Turkish government. The war machine devours more than 40% of Turkey's annual national budget. The huge military burden has pushed Turkey's economic and financial situation to the brink of complete collapse. This danger has caused serious unease within Turkey. The collective resignation of a group of senior generals, including Turkish Army Chief of Staff General Tunaboylu, not long ago, shows the deepening of the crisis in Turkey. If the Turkish ruling clique continues to pursue the American policy of aggressive war, and ignores the peace demands of its own people and the people of the Middle Eastern countries, it will only lead Turkey to a more dangerous path and bring unimaginable serious consequences to the Turkish people.

　　绑在美国战车上的土耳其
　　邢象超
    土耳其军队对叙利亚边境的侵略威胁，在阿拉伯国家和全世界公正舆论的谴责下，现在虽然已经暂时趋于缓和，但战争危机并没有完全消除，土耳其军队还没有从叙利亚边境全部撤退，美国仍然企图随时利用土耳其军队来实现它侵略叙利亚和阿拉伯国家的目的。这清楚地暴露了土耳其是美国侵略中东阿拉伯国家计划中的一个驯服的工具。
    土耳其统治集团屈从美国的侵略政策，是想依靠美国来重整奥斯曼帝国的声威。战后十几年来，土耳其积极支持美国对中东地区的一切侵略计划，不惜把自己的国土变成美国在中东的屯兵场和兵器库。在美国拼凑起来的北大西洋公约集团和巴格达集团中，土耳其是一个拥有庞大陆军的国家。土耳其只有二千四百多万人口，却有五十万人左右的武装部队，其中大部分是陆军。同时，土耳其也是美国军事基地最密集的国家之一。在土耳其的三十万方英里的土地上，美国建立了许多军事基地，其中有二十二个空军基地、十个海、陆军基地，以及许多专门对苏联进行侦察活动的雷达站。美国的第六舰队经常访问和驻屯在土耳其的港口，而美国在自己武装部队内尚未普遍使用的B58式轰炸机，却不断在土耳其的机场起落。
    美国为了使整个土耳其变成它的军事基地，在土耳其参加北大西洋集团以后的几年间曾给了土耳其巨量的军火武器。土耳其单是从美国就得到了一千三百架军用飞机，一千四百辆坦克，三千五百门大炮以及其他装备物资，总值约近二十亿美元。此外，美国又提供了十亿美元的其他“援助”，这些钱主要也是用来扩张军队和保养武器的。美国派出了数达几千人的军事顾问团，负责训练和指挥土耳其部队。
    美国为什么这样重视土耳其呢？这是因为土耳其统治集团愿意屈从于美国的侵略政策，而土耳其地处欧亚非三洲的要冲，在美国侵略者看来，北可以威胁苏联的和平安全，南可以进侵整个中东阿拉伯国家。
    这些年来，美国利用土耳其作基地，对苏联进行了不少侵略性的军事活动。美国曾经多次从土耳其放出气球，利用高空气流对苏联进行军事侦察。美国利用它设在黑海沿岸萨姆松附近的强力雷达站，不断对苏联试验火箭的情况进行了侦察。今年，苏联宣布制成洲际弹道导弹并两次成功的发射了人造卫星，美国在科学技术方面的劣势已经完全暴露出来了。这使土耳其在美国的侵略计划中占有更加重要的地位。据西方报刊透露，美国目前已经试验成功的导弹，只有“红石”式一种，射程仅七百公里。这种导弹，从美国控制的其他国家的基地发射，都达不到苏联的领土。美国想利用土耳其作为它发射火箭的基地。北大西洋集团南欧部队司令美国海军上将罗伯特·布里斯科在11月12日宣布，美国“已向土耳其提出了提供导弹的建议”，这就证实了西方报刊所透露的情况。
    然而，苏联拥有比美国侵略势力强大得多的自卫力量，这一点连美国统治集团现在也不得不承认了。因此，美国虽然打着反苏的旗帜，并且作出种种威胁苏联和平安全的姿态，但任何头脑稍微清醒的人都会知道，美国是没有力量从土耳其发动侵略苏联的战争的。美国扶植土耳其军事力量的真正目的，显然是为了对付中东阿拉伯国家的民族独立运动。近年来的事实也说明，美国为了侵略阿拉伯国家，在中东地区推行所谓艾森豪威尔主义，曾不断在中东制造紧张局势，利用土耳其和以色列威胁阿拉伯国家。今年8月，叙利亚破获美国所策划的颠覆阴谋以后，美国侵略中东的专家汉德逊立即访问了土耳其，接着土耳其军队就集中到叙利亚边境，企图挑起对叙利亚的侵略战争，这十分清楚的表明了土耳其在美国的侵略计划中担当了什么角色。在这次军事威胁中，美国甚至直接指挥了土耳其军队的调动。在土耳其紧邻叙利亚边境的奴息本、加西恩塔普等地都驻有美国部队，漆着美国标志的直升飞机往来频繁，并经常侵犯叙利亚的领空。
    美国这样大规模地在土耳其建筑军事基地和武装土耳其军队，是想利用土耳其廉价的劳动力和廉价的炮灰，为它火中取栗。据西方国家的记者指出，每一个土耳其步兵，每月津贴仅有六分到一角二分美金；全部土军士兵的一年津贴，还买不到一架美国重型军用飞机。即使在侵略朝鲜战争中，一个土耳其士兵的全部费用也不到一个美国兵的五分之一。
    可是，对土耳其来说，恢复奥斯曼帝国旧日的声威，只不过是永远不能实现的梦想。它屈从美国政策的结果，却给土耳其民族带来了深重的灾难。先不说国家主权的丧失，单就军费负担来说，也已经使土耳其压得喘不过气来。美国虽然供给土耳其为数极多的飞机、坦克等重型军事装备，但这些装备的保养、修理和燃料等费用，仍然是由土耳其政府负担的。战争机器吞食了土耳其每年国家预算的40％以上。巨大的军事负担，已经使土耳其的经济财政情况接近完全崩溃的境地。这种危险已经引起土耳其国内的严重不安。不久以前，土耳其陆军参谋长图纳博伊卢将军等一批高级将领的集体辞职，说明了土耳其国内危机的加深。土耳其统治集团如果继续追随美国的侵略战争政策，而漠视它国内人民和中东各国人民的和平要求，那只会使土耳其走到更危险的道路上去，给土耳其人民带来不堪设想的严重后果。
