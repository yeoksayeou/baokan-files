    Welcoming the Bell of 1958
　　Xiangrikui (Sunflower)
    This year on New Year's Eve, starting from 11:45 PM, after the Central People's Broadcasting Station broadcasts several pieces of national instrumental music, people will hear a majestic set of chimes from the Warring States period. Immediately following will be twelve strikes of stone chimes from the Yin Dynasty, announcing the beginning of 1958.
    The Warring States chimes are a musical instrument from the Warring States period more than two thousand years ago in our country. It consists of thirteen bronze bells of different sizes; each bell is divided into four parts: the drum, the zheng, the mei, and the xi, and can produce four tones. This set of chimes was unearthed this May in a Chu tomb in Changtaiguan, Xinyang County, Henan Province.
    The Yin Dynasty stone chimes are one of the oldest musical instruments unearthed in our country. It was produced around 1401 BC, more than 3,350 years ago, and was unearthed in Wuguan Village, Anyang, Henan in 1950.
    When we hear the sound of these two ancient instruments, we will marvel at the amazing wisdom and creativity of our ancestors!

    迎接1958年的钟声
　　向日葵
    今年除夕晚上，从二十三点四十五分起，在中央人民广播电台在播送几首民族器乐曲以后，人们将听到一阵气势磅礴的战国编钟声响了起来。紧接着是十二响殷代的石磬声，宣告1958年开始了。
    战国编钟，是我国两千多年前战国时代的一种乐器。它由十三个大小不同的铜质钟组成；每一个钟分鼓、钲、枚、铣四个部位，能发出四个音。这套编钟，是今年5月在河南省信阳县长台关一座楚墓中发掘出土的。
    殷代石磬，是我国目前发掘出土的最古老的乐器之一。它产生在纪元前约1401年，距今三千三百五十多年，是1950年在河南安阳武官村出土的。
    当我们听到这两种古老乐器的响声时，将要为我们祖先的惊人智慧和创造而感叹！
