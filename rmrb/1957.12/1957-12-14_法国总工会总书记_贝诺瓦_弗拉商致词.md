Comrades:

	On behalf of the French General Confederation of Labor and the French working class, I extend warm fraternal greetings to your Eighth National Congress.

	Through you, the delegates attending the congress, I pay tribute to the heroic Chinese working class. Standing at the forefront of the people of the whole country, the Chinese working class is changing the face of the country and building a new society.

	Our working class is familiar with your long, resolute, and heroic history of struggle to liberate the country from the shackles of imperialism and its running dogs. Our working class warmly salutes your victory. We know that your country and government have made enormous contributions to the struggle to defend peace and strive for friendship among peoples of all countries, which has greatly strengthened the friendly and solidarity feelings of our working class towards you.

	Therefore, I can say that it is in the name of all working people in France that I congratulate you on your greatest achievements in the great cause of building socialism, and I wish your Eighth National Congress a new step forward in fulfilling the tasks of the trade union.

	In France, we share the common goal with the proletarians of the world, but the tasks of the trade union are different from yours.

	We must fight against the ruling class in the camp that hates peace and hates socialism.

	For more than ten years, successive governments in our country have waged colonial wars against the people who are fighting for their own independence.

	For more than ten years, the French General Confederation of Labor has continuously fought for peace and independence in Vietnam, and for peace and independence for the Algerian people.

	At the same time, we must organize workers to take action to defend wages and living conditions.

	The colonial wars waged by successive governments have exhausted the country, and the ruling class is trying to have the people, especially the working class, bear the costs of the war.

	In our country, increased production does not mean improved living conditions for workers, but means increased profits for capitalists and monopoly bourgeoisie. They promote colonial wars and expand armaments, from which they reap huge profits.

	However, the working class defends its living conditions with hardship and courage, and wages an unremitting struggle for peace.

	For ten years, the working class has carried out thousands of strikes to fight for wage increases and to defend social welfare that has been violated.

	In this way, the working class has forced the capitalists to retreat and defeated their attacks. The struggles of the working class have sometimes achieved significant successes, making it difficult for the ruling class to implement its reactionary policies.

	This constantly expanding and sustained action is one of the main reasons for the government instability and numerous government crises that characterize the current political situation in France.

	Just recently, when the parliament was unable to form a government, nearly three million workers held a twenty-four-hour strike demanding wage increases; soon after, one million civil servants and workers in state-owned enterprises followed their example.

	The French ruling class has tried to divide the working class in order to achieve its goals. With the support of reformist leaders, they have done so. In the history of our workers' movement, splitters have split the French General Confederation of Labor for the third time.

	However, the working class is increasingly aware that its division is the root cause of its own weakness and difficulties.

	The French General Confederation of Labor has never ceased its fierce struggle to achieve unified action and trade union unity. Its efforts have been partially successful.

	At present, all struggles and strikes taking place in France are being carried out with the unity of all workers and various organizations in enterprises. The will of the workers to unite is becoming stronger and stronger. Some cadres of organizations outside the General Confederation of Labor, who were hostile to unity yesterday, have now joined the movement for unity, some voluntarily, and some because they would be isolated if they did not.

	For us, as for the working class of the world, the main issue is to further deepen the unity of the workers. The French working class demands profound changes in the political situation of the country. For the French working class, it is not lacking in courage and militancy.

	The only obstacle to achieving these changes is that unified action has not reached a sufficient degree.

	We, the French General Confederation of Labor, believe that the unwavering and vigorous struggle against all obstacles to unity is our main task.

	From experience, we know that this is an arduous task, a sustained struggle. But experience also tells us that as long as there is an indomitable spirit, victory can be won.

	We will continue this struggle, because we know that it is not only a national responsibility, but that in forcing changes in our country's political situation, we are also working to defend world peace.

	Before ending my speech, please allow me to once again wish your congress the greatest achievements, and wish you ever-increasing victories in the construction of the country.

	Long live the All-China Federation of Trade Unions!

	Long live the great solidarity of the working people of the world in victoriously defending peace, defending the independence of all countries, and improving living conditions!

### 法国总工会总书记  贝诺瓦·弗拉商致词

专栏：

    法国总工会总书记
    贝诺瓦·弗拉商致词同志们：
    我代表法国总工会和法国工人阶级，向你们的第八次全国代表大会致以兄弟般的热烈敬礼。
    我通过你们出席大会的代表，向英勇的中国工人阶级致敬。站在全国人民最前列的中国工人阶级，正在改变着国家的面貌，建设一个新的社会。
    我国工人阶级熟悉你们为了把国家从帝国主义及其走狗的枷锁下解放出来，而进行的长期的、坚决的和英勇的斗争历史。我国工人阶级热情地向你们的胜利致敬。我们知道，你们的国家和政府在保卫和平和争取各国人民友谊的斗争中作了巨大的贡献，这就大大地加强了我国工人阶级对你们的友好、团结的感情。
    因此，我可以说，我是以法国全体劳动者的名义，祝贺你们在从事建设社会主义的伟大事业中取得最大的成就，祝你们的第八次全国代表大会在完成工会的任务方面，向前迈进新的一步。
    在法国，我们与全世界无产者有着共同的目标，但是工会的任务却是与你们不相同的。
    我们必须向仇视和平、仇视社会主义的阵营中的统治阶级作斗争。
    十多年来，我国的历届政府对争取自身独立的人民进行了殖民战争。
    十多年来，法国总工会不断地为越南的和平与独立，为阿尔及利亚人民的和平与独立而进行了斗争。
    同时，我们必须组织工人为保卫工资和生活条件而采取行动。
    历届政府所进行的殖民战争使国家精疲力尽，统治阶级并且企图由人民群众，首先是工人阶级来担负战争的费用。
    在我们那里，增加生产并不意味着劳动者生活条件的改善，而是意味着资本家、垄断资产阶级利润的增长。他们推动殖民战争和扩张军备，从中获取巨额利润。
    但是，工人阶级艰苦勇敢地保卫其生存条件，并为拥护和平进行了坚持不渝的斗争。
    十年来，工人阶级进行了成千上万次罢工，争取增加工资，保卫受到侵犯的社会福利。
    这样，工人阶级就迫使资本家退却，并且击败了资本家的进攻。工人阶级的斗争有时获得了重大的成就，使统治阶级的反动政策难以实施。
    这个不断扩大的持久的行动，是引起作为法国当前政局特点的政府不稳定性和无数次政府危机的主要原因之一。
    就在最近，当议会无法组成一个政府的时候，近三百万劳动者举行了要求增加工资的二十四小时罢工；不久，一百万公务员和国营企业工人也仿效了他们的榜样。
    法国统治阶级力图分化工人阶级以便达到其目的。在改良主义领导者的支持下，他们做到了这一点。在我国工人运动史中，分裂分子第三次分裂了法国总工会。
    但是，工人阶级日益认识到，它的分裂正是本身力量薄弱和遭遇困难的根源。
    法国总工会从来没有间断过为了实现统一行动和工会的统一而进行的激烈斗争。它的努力已部分地取得了成就。
    目前，在法国进行的所有斗争和罢工都是在企业中全体劳动者和各个组织团结一致地进行的。劳动者的团结意志越来越坚强。总工会以外的各个组织的一些干部，他们昨天还仇视统一，但今天已经投入团结的运动中，其中有些人是自愿的，有些人则是因为不这样做就会遭到孤立。
    对我们来说，正如对世界工人阶级一样，主要的问题是更深入地实现工人的统一。法国工人阶级要求本国的政局发生深刻的变化。对于法国工人阶级来说，它是不缺乏勇敢和战斗性的。
    获得这些变化的唯一障碍是统一行动尚未达到足够的程度。
    我们法国总工会认为，向统一的一切障碍进行坚持不渝的、强有力的斗争，是我们的主要任务。
    根据经验，我们知道这是一个艰巨的任务，是一场持久的斗争。但是经验也告诉我们，只要有百折不挠的精神，胜利是可以赢得的。
    我们将继续进行这个斗争，因为我们知道这不仅是民族责任，而是在迫使我国政局发生变化的同时，我们也在为保卫世界和平而努力。
    在结束发言以前，请让我再一次祝你们代表大会取得最大的成就，祝你们在国家的建设中取得日新月异的胜利。
    中华全国总工会万岁！
    全世界劳动者为胜利地保卫和平、保卫各国人民的独立、改善生活条件的大团结万岁！（附图片）
