Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, November 30th (Special Dispatch) The Second Session of the First Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Shanxi Provincial Committee, which closed on November 29th, based on the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, specifically deployed further promotion of the whole people's rectification movement and the development of agricultural production.

The meeting analyzed and studied the situation of the whole people's rectification movement in Shanxi Province and how to strive for the complete victory of the rectification movement. At present, the rectification movement in organs, groups, schools, and enterprises above the county (city) level in the province has shifted to the stage of focusing on rectification and reform, and a new upsurge of "big blooming and big contending" has emerged. The whole people's rectification movement in the rural areas of the province has been universally launched in 8,269 agricultural cooperatives after the completion of pilot work. Due to the in-depth development of the rectification movement, not only has people's socialist consciousness been raised, but also a new high tide has emerged on the province's industrial and agricultural production front. It is expected that the province will basically complete the stage of focusing on rectification and reform by the end of January next year and complete the rectification task by the end of April.

In order to achieve a complete victory in the rectification movement, the meeting pointed out that we must not be satisfied with the victories already achieved, and we must not give up halfway or act hastily. The meeting put forward different specific requirements and methods for continuing to deepen the rectification movement among organs, rural areas, workers, and other urban working people. It also required that in the third and fourth stages, efforts should be made to consolidate and expand the achievements of the rectification movement, and to eliminate as much as possible all negative factors in society that are unfavorable to socialism in various aspects. It is required to seriously carry out the rectification movement among handicraft cooperatives, transportation cooperatives, and all urban small vendors and all independent laborers.

The meeting held a heated discussion on the "Shanxi Province Twelve-Year Agricultural Development Plan" (revised draft) proposed by the CPC Shanxi Provincial Committee. The draft plan proposed that by 1967, the total grain output of the province should reach 17.5 billion jin; the average yield per mu in the province, except for a small number of areas with very barren land, should be increased from 125 jin in 1955 to 400 jin. During the second five-year plan period, the agricultural production level and income level of all agricultural cooperatives in the province should catch up with the level of well-to-do middle peasants, and the average yield per mu in some counties should reach 400 jin. By 1967, the area of irrigated land in the province should be increased from 7.36 million mu in 1955 to 24 million mu or 26 million mu. The delegates to the meeting were full of high confidence in completing the grain production increase targets and water conservancy development plan targets in the province's plan during the discussion. Everyone expressed their willingness to lead the province's peasants to push the water conservancy construction and manure accumulation campaign in this winter and next spring to a new high tide, creating favorable conditions for a great leap forward in agricultural production in 1958.

How to make grain production rise steadily at a relatively fast pace? This was a question that the meeting paid close attention to. The meeting believed that in order to achieve the various targets of the province's twelve-year plan, it is necessary to consolidate the collectivization system ideologically, organizationally, and economically, rely on the collective strength of the masses and the possible economic support of the state, gradually transform natural conditions, overcome natural disasters, and take various measures to increase yield per unit area. It is required to vigorously build small-scale water conservancy projects within twelve years to eliminate drought. Two-thirds of the province's water resources have not yet been utilized. Strive for an average of 1.6 mu of irrigated land per capita in the province, so that 80% of the soil erosion area in the province can be controlled. In terms of cultivation, in addition to increasing the multiple cropping area to 20% of the total cultivated land, reorganize the planting area ratio of various crops and adjust the rotation system. It is also necessary to improve 3 million mu of alkaline land and low-lying land, restore abandoned cultivated land, repair river beaches, and build dams to silt land 2.8 million mu. It is also required to change the phenomenon in some areas of simply paying attention to grain and cotton production and neglecting the development of various economies, and vigorously develop various economies such as agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations in mountainous areas.

Mobilizing all forces to support agricultural production was another prominent feature of the meeting. Representatives of industrial, commercial, transportation, cultural, and educational departments attending the meeting put forward preliminary opinions on supporting agriculture at the meeting based on the needs of the province's twelve-year agricultural development plan. Industrial, handicraft, and commercial departments proposed to actively improve the manufacturing and supply of agricultural production materials and overcome the uncoordinated phenomena that existed in the past in terms of supply, production, and sales. According to the established policy of agricultural mechanization, the Provincial Institute of Agricultural Sciences will establish agricultural machinery research institutions to study and test agricultural machinery suitable for Shanxi Province and the transformation of existing agriculture. A group of veteran technical workers will also be transferred from the province's machinery factories to work in agricultural machinery repair and assembly stations in various places. The meeting required that a unified plan including comprehensive balance in all aspects of industry, commerce, transportation, culture, and education be formulated from the bottom up according to the province's twelve-year agricultural development plan.

    中共山西省代表大会确定
    深入开展全民整风运动力求全胜  动员一切力量实现农业增产指标
    本报特约新华社太原30日电11月29日闭幕的中共山西省第一届代表大会第二次会议，根据中央八届三中全会的精神，具体部署了进一步开展全民整风运动和发展农业生产等工作。
    会议分析研究了山西省全民整风运动的情况和如何争取整风运动的完全胜利问题。目前全省县（市）级以上机关、团体和学校、企业的整风运动都已转入着重整改阶段，并且出现了第二次大鸣大放的高潮。全省农村的全民整风运动，在试点工作结束以后，已经在八千二百六十九个农业社普遍展开。由于整风运动的深入开展，不仅使人们的社会主义觉悟提高，全省工农业生产战线上也出现了新的高潮。预计全省将在明年1月底基本上结束着重整改阶段，4月底全部完成整风任务。
    为了使整风运动取得全胜，会议指出决不能满足于已经取得的胜利，决不能半途而废或者草率从事，对机关、农村、工人和城市其他劳动人民中继续深入开展整风运动，会议提出了不同的具体要求和作法，并且要求在第三、第四两个阶段，努力巩固与扩大整风运动的成果，尽可能多地从各方面消除社会上一切不利于社会主义的消极因素。要求在手工业合作社、运输合作社和所有城镇的小商小贩一切独立劳动者当中，也认真地开展整风运动。
    会议对中共山西省委提出的“山西省十二年农业发展规划”（修正草案），进行了热烈的讨论。规划草案中提出到1967年，全省粮食总产量要求达到一百七十五亿斤；全省除一少部分土地很瘠薄的地区以外，每亩平均产量由1955年的一百二十五斤提高到四百斤。在第二个五年计划期间，还要使全省所有的农业社的农业生产水平和收入水平赶上富裕中农的水平，有一部分县每亩平均产量达到四百斤。全省到1967年的水浇地面积，由1955年的七百三十六万亩增加到1967年的二千四百万亩或二千六百万亩。各地到会代表在讨论中，对完成全省规划中粮食增产指标和发展水利的计划指标，充满了高度的信心，大家都表示领导全省农民把今冬明春的水利建设和积肥运动推向高潮，为1958年农业生产大跃进创造良好的条件。
    如何使粮食生产以较快的速度稳定地上升？是这次会议很注意的一个问题。会议认为：为了达到全省十二年规划的各项指标，必须从思想上、组织上和经济上巩固合作化制度，依靠群众的集体力量和国家可能的经济支援，逐步改造自然条件，克服自然灾害，采取各种措施提高单位面积产量。要求在十二年内大力兴修小型水利，消灭旱灾。全省现在还有二分之一的水利资源没有利用。争取全省按人口平均每人有水浇地一亩六分，使全省80％的水土流失面积得到控制。在耕作上除使复种面积增加到占耕地总数的20％以外，改组各种作物的种植面积比例和调整轮作制。还要改良碱地、低洼地三百万亩，恢复弃耕地、修河滩、打坝淤地二百八十万亩。还要求改变有些地区单纯注意粮棉生产、忽视发展各种经济的现象，大力开发山区的农业、林业、畜牧业和副业等多种经济。
    动员一切力量支援农业生产，是这次会议的另一个显明特点。出席会议的工业、商业、交通运输、文教等部门的代表，根据全省十二年农业发展规划的需要，都在会上提出了支援农业的初步意见。工业、手工业、商业部门提出要积极改进农业生产资料的制造和供应工作，克服过去在供产销方面存在的不协调现象。根据农业机械化的既定方针，省农业科学研究所将建立农业机械的研究机构，研究和试用适合山西省需要的农业机械和现有农业的改造。从全省机械厂中还将要抽调一批老技术工人分配到各地的农业机器修配站去工作。会议要求根据全省十二年农业发展规划，自下而上地制定出包括工业、商业、交通运输、文教等各方面的综事平衡的统一规划。
