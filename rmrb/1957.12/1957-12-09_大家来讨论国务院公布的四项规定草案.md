　　Impossible to Achieve Absolute Uniformity
　　After reading the article "Exploration of the Vagueness of Family Visit Leave" (see page 3 of this newspaper on November 29), I have a different opinion.
　　There are only Spring Festival, National Day, and May Day once a year. Apart from the time required for meetings, activities, and round trips, even if one goes home during these holidays, the total stay is only four or five days. If we follow Comrade Zhou Zhi's suggestion and do not give leave, the opportunity to reunite with family members will be too small compared to those who can use public holidays to go home and those who live far away. This is unreasonable. Comrade Zhou cited an example: it takes 30 days to travel from Northeast China to Yunnan. If the state gives six weeks of leave, one can only live at home for twelve days, which is one or two dozen days less than those who live closer. He advocated extending the leave to achieve uniform family visit time. I disagree with this opinion. Because each employee lives at a different distance from home, even those who live nearby are not exactly the same. It is impossible to achieve absolute uniformity. Therefore, I still agree with the provisions of the draft.
　　Regarding the issue of reimbursement for train and boat fares. It is a personal matter for employees to go home for family visits. The state provides leave and wages to give employees a certain opportunity to reunite with their families. Those who live too far away and have lower wages are also given subsidies. This is a great consideration. Our country has a large population and a poor foundation, so we should not rely entirely on subsidies. Comrades who live far away can save some money by being frugal and thrifty, and with the state's subsidies, it will not be too difficult to go home for family visits. Therefore, I disagree with revising the travel expense subsidy method.

　　The Decision to Consolidate the Worker-Peasant Alliance
　　I strongly support the State Council's interim regulations on the wage treatment of ordinary workers and odd-job workers. Implementing these regulations can prevent a large influx of rural youth into cities. Taking the situation in my hometown (a mountainous area of Jin County) as an example, there are only eighty-two households in the whole village, and thirty-two young people blindly flowed into the city to work as ordinary workers and odd-job workers last year. During the summer hoeing season, there were only eighteen people left in one team in the commune. Because there were few people and a lot of land, everyone was too busy to hoe it all. Not only that, but some young people who stayed in the countryside were not content with agricultural labor in order to earn more money and always wanted to run to the city. After the implementation of the new regulations, this kind of phenomenon can be avoided.

　　Become a Technician in Name and in Fact
　　I am a young apprentice. In the past, our apprenticeship period was indeed too short. After only half a year of study in the factory, we were promoted to technicians. The title was good, but the actual knowledge was very poor. We neither understood the complexity of the technology nor had work experience. It was easy to produce defective products and cause accidents in production. Rapid promotion also easily made young apprentices arrogant and self-righteous and disrespectful to old technicians, which was not conducive to apprentices improving their technical level and ideological awareness. Therefore, I think it is absolutely necessary to extend the apprenticeship period.
　　Excessively high treatment for apprentices also makes young apprentices unwilling to study technology diligently, but instead pursue personal gains and losses, and even extravagant and wasteful in life. I think the government has seen this problem, and the new regulations are timely. I support this regulation and will definitely not fail the Party's training. I am willing to study hard during the study period and become a technician in name and in fact in the future.

　　Taking Care of People with Special Contributions
　　Regarding the State Council's provisional regulations (draft) on the retirement of workers and staff, I think it does not take into account people who are under 50 years old, but have a long working age and have made special contributions to society and have lost their ability to work. For example, those who participated in the First Domestic Revolutionary War and the Anti-Japanese War, who have struggled hard for a long time and whose bodies are weakened and have lost their ability to work. Many of them joined the revolution at the age of fifteen and are now only forty years old, with twenty-five years of service. Because they are not yet fifty years old, they cannot enjoy retirement benefits and can only be treated as resignation. And some people only joined the revolution at the age of forty, with only ten years of service. Now that they are fifty years old, they can enjoy retirement benefits. Judging from the above situation, there are unreasonable aspects. I think we can stipulate conditions like this: "Those who have made special contributions to society, have worked for more than fifteen years, and whose bodies are weakened and have lost their ability to work, regardless of age, and who are certified by a doctor as unable to continue working, can also enjoy retirement benefits."

### 大家来讨论国务院公布的四项规定草案

　　大家来讨论国务院公布的四项规定草案
    不可能绝对一致
    读了“探亲假期太笼统”（见11月29日本报三版）一文后，我有不同的意见。
    一年只有一个春节、国庆节、五一节，除了开会活动和往返旅途所需的时间外，即使在这几个假日里都回家，总共不过住了四五天，如果按周志同志的建议作，不给假期，同能利用公共休假日回家和离家远的人比起来，与家属团聚的机会就太少。这不合理。周同志举例说，从东北到云南往返旅途需三十天，如果国家给假六个星期，就只能在家居住十二天，比路途较近的人在家住的时间少了一、二十天，他主张延长假期，以达到探亲时间一致。我不同意这个意见。因为每个职工离家远近不同，就是近的也不完全相同，不可能达到绝对一致。所以，我还是同意草案的规定。
    关于车船费补助问题。职工回家探亲是个人的私事，国家为了职工同家属有一定团聚的机会，给予假期，工资；离家太远、工资较低的，还给以补贴，这就是绝大的照顾。我们国家人口多、底子穷，不应当完全依靠补助。离家远的同志，只要平时注意节约，储积一部分钱，加上国家的补助，回家探亲是不会有多大困难的。因此，我不同意修改路费补助办法。

　  巩固工农联盟的决定
    我很拥护国务院关于普通工和勤杂工的工资待遇暂行规定。实施这个规定可以防止农村青年大量流入城市。拿我的家乡（锦县一个山区）情况来说，全村只有八十二户人家，去年就有三十二名青年盲目流入城市当普通工和勤杂工。在夏锄时，社里一个队只剩下十八个人了，由于人少地多，大家怎么忙也锄不出来。不仅如此，有些留在农村的青年为了多挣钱不安心农业劳动，也总想往城里跑。实施新规定以后，这类现象就可以避免。

　　做一个名副其实的技工
    我是一个青年徒工。过去我们学徒的期限的确太短了，进厂学习才半年，就升为技工，名义不错，但实际知识很差，既不懂得技术的复杂性，也没有工作经验，在生产中很容易出废品和造成事故。升级较快，也容易使青年徒工骄傲自大，不尊重老技工，这对徒工提高技术水平和思想觉悟都不利。因此我认为延长学徒期是完全必要的。
    徒工待遇过高，也会使青年徒工不虚心钻研技术，而追求个人得失，甚至生活上铺张浪费。我认为政府看到了这个问题，定出了新规定是适时的。我拥护这个规定，一定不辜负党的培养，愿在学习期内刻苦钻研，将来成为名副其实的技工。

  　照顾有特殊贡献的人
    国务院关于工人、职员退休处理的暂行规定（草案），我认为没有照顾到未到五十岁、但工龄较长、对社会有特殊贡献的丧失劳动能力的人。如参加过第一次国内革命战争、抗日战争，经过长期的艰苦奋斗而身体衰弱丧失劳动能力的人。其中有许多是十五岁参加革命，现在才四十岁，已有二十五年工龄，因不到五十岁，就不能享受退休待遇，只能按退职处理。而有一些人是四十岁才参加革命，工龄只有十年，现在够五十岁了，就能享受退休待遇。根据上述情况来看是有不够合理的地方。我认为可规定类似这样的条件：“对社会有特殊贡献，工龄满十五年以上，身体衰弱丧失劳动能力，不限年龄大小，经医生证明不能继续工作的，也可以享受退休待遇。”
