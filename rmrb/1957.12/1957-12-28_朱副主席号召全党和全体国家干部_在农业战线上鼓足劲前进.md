Xinhua News Agency, December 26th. Vice Chairman Zhu De gave important instructions on current agricultural work at the National Agricultural Work Conference on the afternoon of December 23rd. He called on the whole Party and all state working cadres to go all out in the high tide of developing agriculture and to strive to realize and achieve ahead of schedule the tasks stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft).

Vice Chairman Zhu first pointed out: Agriculture must be developed more rapidly. He said: Agriculture occupies a very important position in my country's national economy. Agricultural and sideline products account for nearly half of the total value of industrial and agricultural output, and the number of people engaged in agricultural production accounts for more than 80% of the country's total population. Agriculture not only provides raw materials and markets for light industry, but also is an important market for many heavy industrial products. At the same time, agriculture is also one of the most important sources of export goods and capital accumulation in our country. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the development of agricultural production could not keep up with the needs of the development of industry and the entire national construction, especially in 1955 and 1957, the development of the entire socialist construction cause has been considerably affected. Therefore, how to treat the issue of developing agriculture has become a key issue in my country's socialist construction at present. Starting from this situation, the Party Central Committee and the government have decided to use greater efforts to develop agricultural production during the Second and Third Five-Year Plan periods. That is to say, in our national construction, we must implement the guiding principle of developing industry and developing agriculture simultaneously on the basis of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, and develop agriculture more rapidly; ensure that our country is built into a prosperous and strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture in ten to fifteen years, and strive to catch up with or surpass the United Kingdom in terms of important industrial output within about fifteen years.

Vice Chairman Zhu said: Generally speaking, my country's agricultural production has achieved great development during the First Five-Year Plan period. It is expected that the total output value of agricultural and sideline products and some important agricultural and sideline products such as grain, cotton, and tea can exceed the plan. Greater achievements have also been made in agricultural infrastructure construction such as water conservancy, soil and water conservation, and land reclamation. Our country completed the socialist transformation of agriculture during this period, but we not only avoided the possible temporary decline in agricultural production, but also achieved the goal of continued agricultural production increase. This is particularly gratifying.

However, we still face many major problems in agriculture: First, agricultural development, especially in many industrial raw material crops, still cannot keep up with the needs of industrial and the entire national economic development. Although there has been a large increase in grain production, it is still felt to be insufficient. Second, although the total agricultural output value plan and the total grain output target have been completed nationwide, the completion of the plan by various provinces (cities) and autonomous regions is unbalanced. Some provinces have already lagged behind in developing agriculture. Within a province, there are some counties that have not completed the agricultural production increase plan, and the output of many counties is even lower than that of 1952. It is estimated that there will also be such contradictory situations of production increase and decrease in a county's districts and townships. This is a rather serious phenomenon. The reason why many agricultural and sideline products and many regions cannot reach the planned targets is partly due to objective reasons such as poor natural conditions and being subjected to floods, droughts, and insect pests; on the other hand, it is clear that the subjective work has not been done well. The same natural conditions have high yields, low yields, increased production, and decreased production, and even areas with poor natural conditions and subjected to floods and droughts have achieved higher yields. This proves that the reason why many regions have not completed the agricultural production increase plan is mainly due to the fact that the work has not been done well. These are the main problems that we must strive to solve in the future.

Next, Vice Chairman Zhu pointed out: To further develop agricultural production, we must, according to the provisions of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), adopt the method of combining top-down and bottom-up, and mobilize the masses to discuss and formulate comprehensive plans for each province, county, township, and agricultural cooperative that are truly practical. With a plan, there will be a goal to strive for and a basis for inspection, and we will not lose sight of one thing while attending to another. This plan should include two main aspects. On the one hand, it is required to consolidate the agricultural collectivization system, and to require that within three to five years, the production and income of most agricultural cooperative members catch up with or exceed the level of local wealthy middle peasants. On the other hand, it is necessary to formulate practical, possible, and fully active production increase targets for various major agricultural products. While agriculture is developing, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, small-scale processing industries and mining industries, as well as culture, education, and health, also need to be developed accordingly.

All these undertakings are entirely possible and should mainly rely on agricultural cooperatives to do well. In order to ensure various constructions and measures for agricultural production increase, such as water conservancy and soil and water conservation, fertilizer accumulation and seed selection, etc., it is also necessary to make plans and set targets for completion on a regular basis. All these production and construction works are interconnected and must be coordinated with each other. This plan must be adapted to local conditions. Mountainous areas must march towards mountainous areas; areas with low-yielding land must march towards low-yielding land. There must be no uniformity.

At the present stage, the key to developing agriculture is mainly to solve the problems of water conservancy and fertilizer. And the issue of agricultural mechanization is also increasingly being put on the agenda.

Water conservancy construction must rely on the masses, with small-scale projects run by the masses as the main focus, and combine them with a part of medium-sized and a small number of large-scale projects run by the state. Small-scale projects as the main focus can become a mass water conservancy construction movement; only by forming a mass movement can we eradicate floods and droughts. In terms of fertilizer, my country currently produces very little chemical fertilizer, so it is necessary to carry out a wide-ranging fertilizer accumulation movement. My country has many sources of fertilizer. Human and animal manure, green manure, and aquatic algae are all abundant sources of fertilizer. To solve the fertilizer problem, it is also mainly necessary to rely on the masses. On the issue of supplying agricultural machinery, many people used to have a wrong idea that my country has a large population and little cultivated land, and that production can be increased without using machines, and that the realization of agricultural mechanization is a matter for the distant future. However, practice in recent years has proved that after agriculture has achieved collectivization, and under the circumstances of a large-scale development of agricultural production, rural labor is not only not surplus, but is increasingly felt to be insufficient. Farmers' demands for various agricultural machines, especially small-scale agricultural machines, are becoming increasingly urgent. Machines going to the countryside is a new thing in my country's history, and it is a symbol of the rapid development of my country's socialist agricultural economy. Do not underestimate the significance of this matter. In this regard, industry has begun to lag behind the needs of agricultural development. With the implementation of the forty articles of the Agricultural Program and the further development of agriculture, the driving role of agriculture in the development of industry will become even more significant. Machines going to the countryside also raises many new issues for rural work. A series of measures must be taken, such as training personnel to use various machines, organizing repair and maintenance organizations, supplying spare parts, and correspondingly improving labor organization, so as to ensure the regular and effective use of these machines.

In the development of agriculture, in addition to paying attention to the development of grain and cotton and other important industrial raw material crops, Vice Chairman Zhu also requested: We should also pay attention to the development of all agricultural and sideline products that can be supplied for export. He said that during the First Five-Year Plan period, agricultural and sideline products accounted for about 75% of the total export value. This shows that agriculture is one of the most important sources of export goods in our country. In the future, the proportion of agricultural and sideline products in the total export value may decrease relatively due to the increasing export of industrial products, but in terms of absolute quantity, we should still strive for more increases year by year. In order to develop the export trade of agricultural and sideline products, we must adopt policies to encourage production, incorporate the production targets for developing agricultural and sideline products for export into the agricultural development plan, and the purchase prices must be sufficient to encourage production enthusiasm; we must conscientiously organize the purchase, processing, and transportation of export products.

Finally, Vice Chairman Zhu emphasized: We now have full conditions to strive for a great leap forward on the agricultural front and strive to complete the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) on schedule or ahead of schedule. My country's agricultural collectivization has been basically completed. More than 97% of farmers have joined agricultural production cooperatives. After the national rectification movement in 1957, the enthusiasm of the broad masses has been unprecedentedly high, and a high tide of agricultural production increase has begun to appear. At the same time, the Party Central Committee's policy of using greater efforts to develop agriculture has also been determined. The Party Central Committee and the government are using a large amount of manpower, materials, and financial resources to support the development of agricultural production. Under this situation, enhancing the awareness of all Party comrades of the importance of developing agriculture, strengthening the leadership of local Party committees and people's committees at all levels over agriculture, and strengthening the support of various departments for the agricultural front are of decisive significance. We must oppose conservatism in developing agriculture, and oppose the phenomenon of leadership lagging behind the mass high tide of production increase. We must oppose the idea of underestimating agriculture. All conscious state working cadres, especially educated youth, should warmly respond to the call of the Party and the government to "go down to the countryside and up to the mountains." Going to the agricultural front is not only an excellent opportunity for the vast number of cadres and young people to realize the integration with workers and peasants, but also they can bring their cultural knowledge to the countryside and make important contributions to the cause of building a prosperous and happy new socialist countryside.

    朱副主席号召全党和全体国家干部
    在农业战线上鼓足劲前进
    新华社26日讯　朱德副主席23日下午在全国农业工作会议上，对当前农业工作作了重要的指示。他号召全党和全体国家工作干部在发展农业的高潮中鼓足劲前进，为实现和提早实现农业发展纲要（修正草案）所规定的任务而奋斗。
    朱副主席首先指出：必须更快地发展农业。他说：农业在我国国民经济中占有很重要的地位，农副业产品在工农业总产值中的比重接近一半，从事农业生产的人数更占了全国人口80％以上。农业不仅为轻工业提供原料和市场，并且是许多重工业品的重要市场。同时农业还是我国出口物资和资金积累的最重要来源之一。由于第一个五年计划期间，农业生产的发展赶不上工业和整个国家建设发展的需要，特别是在1955年和1957年，整个社会主义建设事业的发展已经受到了相当的影响。因此，怎样对待发展农业的问题，在目前就成为了我国社会主义建设中的一个关键性的问题。从这种情况出发，党中央和政府已经决定在第二个和第三个五年计划期间，用较大的力量来发展农业生产。这就是说，我们在国家建设中，必须执行在优先发展重工业的基础上，实行发展工业和发展农业同时并举的指导方针，更快地发展农业；保证在十年到十五年的时间内把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的富强的社会主义国家，并且要在十五年左右的时间内，在重要工业产量水平方面赶上或者超过英国。
    朱副主席说：在第一个五年计划期间，总的来说我国农业生产获得了巨大的发展。在农副业总产值和粮食、棉花、茶叶等一些重要农副产品方面，预计都可以超过计划。其它如在兴修水利、进行水土保持、开垦荒地等农业基本建设方面，也获得了更大成就。我国在这个期间完成了农业的社会主义改造，但是我们不但避免了可能发生的农业生产的暂时下降现象，而且达到了农业继续增产的目的。这一点是特别值得高兴的。
    但是，我们在农业方面还面对着许多重大问题：第一，农业发展，尤其是在许多工业原料作物方面，仍然赶不上工业和整个国民经济发展的需要。粮食虽然有了很大增产，也仍然感觉不足。第二，农业总产值计划和粮食总产量指标，在全国说虽然完成了，但是各省（市）自治区完成计划的情况是不平衡的。有些省份在发展农业方面已经落后了。一省之内都有一些县没有完成农业增产计划，有不少县的产量甚至比1952年的产量还低。估计一个县的区乡也会有这种增产和减产的矛盾情况。这是一个相当严重的现象。许多农副业产品和许多地区所以不能达到计划的指标，一方面有自然条件不好，遭到水、旱、虫灾等客观原因；另一方面显然还有主观方面工作没有做好的原因。同样的自然条件，却有高产、低产、增产、减产之分，甚至自然条件差，遭到了水旱灾害的地区，达到了更高的产量。这就证明，许多地区所以没有完成农业增产计划，工作没有做好的原因是更主要的。这些就是我们在今后时期内必须努力解决的主要问题。
    接着，朱副主席指出：进一步地发展农业生产必须根据农业发展纲要（修正草案）的规定，采取自上而下和自下而上互相结合的办法，发动群众来讨论和制订各省、各县、各乡和各个农业社的，真正切合实际的综合规划。有了规划就有了奋斗的目标，检查的根据，就不会顾此失彼。这种规划应当包括两个方面的主要内容。一方面是要求巩固农业合作化制度，要求在三年到五年内，使大多数农业社社员的生产和收入赶上或者超过当地富裕中农的水平。另一方面是制定各种主要农产品的实际可能而又充分积极的增产指标。与农业发展的同时，林业、牧业、副业、小型加工工业和采矿业，以及文化、教育、卫生等，也需相应地发展起来。
    所有这些事业，都完全有可能而且也应当主要依靠农业社来办好。为了保证农业增产的各种建设和措施，如水利和水土保持，积肥选种等等，也必须作出规划，定出定期完成的指标。所有这些生产和建设工作是彼此联系着的，必须互相配合起来。这种规划必须因地制宜，山区就要向山区进军；有低产地的地区就要向低产地进军，绝不能千篇一律。
    目前时期发展农业的关键，主要是解决水利和肥料问题。而农业机械化问题，也在日益提到日程上来。
    兴修水利必须依靠群众，以群众举办的小型工程为主，和国家举办的一部分中型的和少数大型的工程互相结合起来。小型为主才能成为群众性的水利建设运动；只有形成了群众性的运动才能根除水旱灾害。肥料方面，目前我国生产的化学肥料还很少，因此必须开展广泛的积肥运动。我国肥源是很多的，人畜粪便，绿肥水藻等都是丰富的肥源。要解决肥料问题，也同样主要是必须依靠群众。在供应农业机械问题上，过去许多人曾经有一个错误的想法，认为我国人口多、耕地少，不使用机器也可以提高产量，并且认为实现农业机械化是遥远将来的事情。但是最近几年来的实践证明，在农业已经实现合作化以后，在农业生产大发展的情况下，农村劳动力不但没有多余，而是日益感到不足。农民对于各种农业机械，首先是小型的农业机械的要求，正在日益迫切起来。机器下乡，这是我国历史上的新鲜事情，这是我国社会主义农业经济大踏步向前发展的象征。千万不要把这件事的意义低估了。在这方面，工业已经开始赶不上农业发展的需要了。随着农业纲要四十条的执行和农业的进一步发展，农业对于工业发展的推动作用还会更加显著。机器下乡也给农村工作提出了许多新问题。必须采取一系列的措施，例如训练各种机器的使用人员，组织修配机构，供应零件，相应地改进劳动组织等等，以便保证这些机器的经常和有效的使用。
    在农业的发展中，除了应当首先注意发展粮食和棉花等重要工业原料作物的生产以外，朱副主席还要求：应当同样注意发展一切可以供应出口的农副业产品的生产。他说，第一个五年计划期间，农副业产品在出口总额中，占了75％左右。这就可见，农业是我国出口物资的最重要的来源之一。今后农副业产品在出口总额中的比重，由于工业产品出口的日益增加，可能会相对地有所下降，但在绝对的数量方面，仍应争取逐年有较多的增加。为了发展农副业产品的出口贸易，必须采取鼓励生产的政策，把发展供应出口的农副业产品的生产指标订入发展农业的规划中去，收购价格必须足以鼓舞生产的积极性；必须切实组织好出口产品的收购、加工和运输工作。
    最后，朱副主席着重指出：我们现在有充分的条件，争取在农业战线上来一个巨大的跃进，争取农业发展纲要（修正草案）按期或提前完成。我国农业合作化已经基本完成，97％以上的农民已经加入了农业生产合作社，又经过1957年的全民整风运动，广大群众的积极性空前高涨，一个农业增产高潮已经开始出现。同时党中央关于用较大的力量来发展农业的方针，也是确定了的。党中央和政府正在以大量的人力、物力和财力来支持农业生产的发展。在这种情况下，提高全党同志对于发展农业的重要性的认识，加强各级地方党委、人民委员会对于农业的领导，加强各部门对于农业战线的支援，就有了决定的意义。必须反对发展农业方面的保守主义倾向，反对领导落在群众性的增产高潮后面的现象。必须反对轻视农业的思想。一切有觉悟的国家工作干部，特别是知识青年，应当热烈地响应党和政府关于“下乡上山”的号召。到农业战线上去，这不但是广大的干部和青年实现和工农群众相结合的极好的机会，而且他们这样做，就可以把自己的文化知识带到农村中去，就可以对于建成繁荣幸福的社会主义的新农村的事业，作出重要的贡献。
