Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, December 3rd. The volunteer sewing cooperative organized by students of the Northeast Institute of Technology began serving "customers" at the end of November.

　　This volunteer sewing cooperative was formed under the initiative of Liu Shuhui and Fu Runlan, Communist Youth League members and second-year students in the Mining and Electrical Engineering Department. Previously, they often saw classmates taking their clothes to the street to be mended, costing at least a dime each time, and taking up a lot of time. Therefore, they proposed establishing a volunteer sewing cooperative. After this proposal was put forward, fifteen male and female students who knew how to use sewing machines actively signed up to participate. They utilized an old sewing machine from the school, and mobilized students to recycle waste products such as ink bottles and toothpaste tubes, selling them to buy needles and thread.

　　The volunteer sewing cooperative will be "open for business" during spare time on Thursday and Friday afternoons each week. Each member participating in the cooperative will dedicate one hour of spare time each week to mend clothes for classmates free of charge.

　  大学生义务缝纫合作社
    新华社沈阳3日电　东北工学院学生自己组织起来的义务缝纫合作社，11月底开始为“顾客”服务。
    这个义务缝纫合作社，是在矿电系二年级学生、共青团员刘淑慧和傅润兰倡议下组成的。以前，她们经常看到同学们拿着衣服到街上去补，每次最少要花一角多钱，还要花不少时间。于是，她们就提出成立义务缝纫合作社。这个倡议提出后，就有十五个会用缝纫机的男女学生积极报名参加。他们把学校的一台旧缝纫机利用起来，并动员同学把墨水瓶、牙膏瓶等废品回收，卖出钱来买针、买线。
    义务缝纫合作社将在每周利用星期四、五的下午课余时间“营业”，参加合作社的每个成员，每周抽一小时的课余时间为同学们免费缝补衣服。
