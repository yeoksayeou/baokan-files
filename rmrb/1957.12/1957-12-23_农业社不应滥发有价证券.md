	Agricultural Cooperatives Should Not Indiscriminately Issue Securities

	Currently, some agricultural production cooperatives in some areas are printing a lot of securities with different names. Some are called circulating notes, some are called vegetable coupons, and some are called work point coupons. The face value of these securities is the same as the Renminbi issued by the state, with denominations ranging from fen, jiao, yuan, to ten yuan. These coupons are mainly circulated within the cooperative. Their use is primarily for advances given to members by the cooperative. However, the amount issued is very large, sometimes as high as over 9,000 yuan, and they are not for one-time use only, but are repeatedly used in a "in and out" manner. As a result, these securities, once in the hands of the members, are used for everything and circulate freely. For example, for buying and selling payments, as gift certificates, etc. Some cooperatives also use them outside the cooperative. For example, members of the Jianqiang Agricultural Cooperative in Xing'an Township, Fushun City, can use the coupons to pay for medical consultations and medicines at the clinic, to buy woodenware at the woodworking cooperative, and to buy ironware at the ironworking cooperative. The iron and woodworking cooperatives can also use these coupons to pay the agricultural cooperative for transportation costs.

	From the above situation, it is clear that these securities have replaced the function of the state currency circulation. This increases the amount of currency in circulation in the domestic market and disrupts the monetary circulation order. I believe that the issuance of these securities is illegal; it will not only cause market confusion, but also easily lead to the malpractice of issuing blank checks within the cooperative, affecting the consolidation of the cooperative. Therefore, I suggest that the relevant departments should stop this in a timely manner to avoid serious adverse consequences. Cui Liangwen

### 农业社不应滥发有价证券

    农业社不应滥发有价证券
    当前，有些地方的农业生产合作社，印制了很多名称不同的有价券证，有的叫流通票，有的叫菜票，也有的叫工分票。这些有价证券的票面额和国家发行的人民币一样，有分券、角券、元券、十元券等多种。这种券主要是在社内流通的。他的使用范围首先是社里给社员的预支。但是发行数额很大，有的高达九千多元，同时也不是使用一次为止，也是采取出笼和回笼的方式反复使用。这样一来，这些有价证券到了社员手以后，就无所不用，流通无阻。例如买卖支付、作礼券等。有的社对社外也使用。如抚顺市兴安乡坚强农业社的社员可以持券到卫生所去交诊疗费和医药费，到木业社去买木器，到铁业社去买铁器。铁木业社也可以用这种券支付给农业社的运费。
    从以上这些情况来看，这种有价证券就显然代替了国家货币流通的职能。这样，就增加了国内市场上的货币流通量，破坏货币流通秩序。这种有价证券的发行，我认为是不合法的，它不但会引起市场混乱，同时在社内也容易造成开空头支票的流弊，影响社的巩固。所以，我建议各有关部门应及时制止，以免产生严重的不良后果。崔良文
