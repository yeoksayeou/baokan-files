Strengthen Leadership at All Levels and Make Preparations
Beijing to Launch Winter Campaign to Eliminate the Four Pests and Promote Hygiene

(Our newspaper reports) Beijing is actively preparing to launch a winter campaign to "eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene."

In order to ensure the smooth progress of this campaign, the Beijing Patriotic Health Campaign Committee has done a lot of preparatory work. First, it strengthened the leadership of the Municipal Patriotic Health Campaign Committee, and reorganized and replenished the Patriotic Health Campaign Committee organizations at all levels. Second, it invited model units and health models to hold discussions according to various systems, visited farmers and experts in the suburbs, and widely solicited their opinions on carrying out the winter patriotic health campaign and launching a large-scale health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests in the future. Based on these opinions, the work plan for the winter health campaign was repeatedly revised. In order to widely promote the health work experience and the experience of eliminating the four pests of typical units in the campaign, the Beijing Patriotic Health Campaign Committee also organized many typical experience exchange meetings, and organized observations to determine the most fundamental and effective methods for eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene, and repeatedly publicized and promoted these methods. For example, this winter, the city will vigorously promote the use of drugs to poison rats and the use of mud to seal compost to eliminate the breeding grounds of fly pupae.

Beijing organized district heads, agricultural cooperative directors, and others to visit the mud-sealed composting in Xibalizhuang and Tiancun Township in the suburbs of Beijing. The local agricultural cooperative introduced their experience in combining fertilizer accumulation and hygiene, and adopting scientific methods to treat manure and garbage. The Dongdan District demonstrated how to use drugs to kill rats. At the same time, it also organized units such as organs, factories, construction sites, schools, service industries, and catering industries to observe and exchange experiences with each other. Recently, it is also planning to organize a large-scale sparrow catching experience exchange meeting to prepare for the sparrow catching campaign month in the spring of next year.

In order to make this campaign achieve the expected results, the Beijing Patriotic Health Campaign Committee and relevant departments jointly formed a publicity office, responsible for overall publicity work. Currently, it is actively preparing publicity materials and organizing forces. In the publicity and education work of this campaign, the focus will be on criticizing factories, organs, schools, enterprises and other units for not paying attention to hygiene work, believing that eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene is dispensable; opposing hygiene work with production and study; emphasizing difficulties, waiting passively, and the backward ideas existing among some masses, especially farmers, that "if it is not dirty, you will not get sick" and "getting sick is bad luck." In addition, the patriotic health campaign and the elimination of the four pests are listed as one of the contents of the socialist debate, laying a solid ideological foundation for the regularization of health work. At present, the rural areas in the suburbs should combine the large-scale production movement of water conservancy construction and increased fertilizer accumulation to make a hygiene work plan for "eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene."

In addition, industrial and commercial departments have made full preparations for the supply of drugs and tools necessary for eliminating the four pests. For example, the Second Local Industry Bureau guarantees that there will be no shortage of drugs for rat extermination, and relevant departments will organize sales to facilitate the masses. The Handicraft Industry Bureau is actively organizing the production and processing of clips for eliminating rats and sparrows, and sesame oil and nets for eliminating sparrows. The commercial sector has also made preparations for organizing the purchase, sales of sparrows.

On December 2, the Beijing Patriotic Health Campaign Committee held an enlarged committee meeting to formally deploy the work of Beijing's winter campaign to "eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene" this year. Starting from the 3rd, five large-scale mobilization meetings will be held according to the system to gradually launch the winter patriotic health campaign.

This campaign will be carried out in four stages. The first stage is to eliminate overwintering mosquitoes and flies; improve environmental hygiene; deepen the campaign to dissuade spitting everywhere; and prevent gas poisoning and common diseases in winter. In the second stage, in addition to continuing the activities of the first stage, a rat-catching campaign will be launched. In the third stage, a sparrow-catching campaign will be launched, and the activities of the first and second stages will continue. The fourth stage is make up lessons and summarize.

    加强各级领导做好准备工作
    北京将开展冬季除四害讲卫生运动
    本报讯　北京市积极准备开展冬季“除四害、讲卫生”运动。
    为了保证这一运动的顺利开展，北京市爱国卫生运动委员会曾经做了许多准备工作。首先加强市爱国卫生运动委员会的领导力量，整顿和充实了各级爱国卫生运动委员会组织。其次按各个系统分别邀请了典型单位和卫生模范举行座谈，访问了郊区农民和专家，广泛征求他们对开展冬季爱国卫生运动和今后大规模开展以除四害为中心的卫生运动的意见，并且根据这些意见反复修改了冬季卫生运动的工作计划。为了在运动中普遍推广典型单位的卫生工作经验和除四害的经验，北京市爱国卫生运动委员会还组织了许多次典型经验交流会，并且组织了观摩，确定除四害讲卫生的最根本最有效的作法，对这些作法加以反复宣传和推广。如今年冬季将要在全市范围内，大力推广使用药物毒杀老鼠和采用泥封堆肥的方法消灭蝇蛹主要孳生地的经验。
    北京市曾组织各区区长、农业社主任等参观了北京郊区西八里庄和田村乡的泥封堆肥，由当地农业社介绍了他们结合积肥、搞好卫生，采用科学方法处理粪便、垃圾的经验，观摩了东单区怎样采用药物灭鼠。同时，还组织了各机关、工厂、建筑工地、学校、服务行业、饮食行业等单位互相观摩、交流经验。最近还计划组织一次大规模的捕雀经验交流会，为明年春天开展捕雀运动月作好准备。
    为了使这次运动收到预期的效果，北京市爱国卫生运动委员会同有关部门共同组成了宣传办公室，负责全面的宣传工作。目前正积极准备宣传材料，组织力量。在这次运动的宣传教育工作中，将着重批判工厂、机关、学校、企业等单位不重视卫生工作，认为除四害、讲卫生可有可无；把卫生工作同生产、学习对立起来；强调困难，消极等待，以及一部分群众中，特别是农民中存在的“不干不净吃了没病”，“得病是时运不好”的落后思想。此外，还把爱国卫生运动和除四害列为社会主义大辩论内容之一，给卫生工作经常化打下巩固的思想基础。目前郊区农村要结合兴修水利、增积肥料的大生产运动，作出“除四害、讲卫生”的卫生工作规划。
    此外，对除四害所必需的药物、工具的供应，工业和商业部门都作了充分准备，如第二地方工业局保证灭鼠用的药物不缺货，有关部门为了便利群众将组织推销。手工业管理局正积极组织生产和加工消灭鼠雀用的夹子，和灭雀用的苏子油、线网等。商业部门也做好了组织收购麻雀和供销的准备工作。
    12月2日，北京市爱国卫生运动委员会举行了扩大委员会，正式布置了北京市今年冬季开展“除四害、讲卫生”运动的工作。从3日起，将按照系统，召开五个大规模的动员大会，把冬季爱国卫生运动逐步开展起来。
    这次运动将分作四个阶段进行。第一个阶段，消灭过冬蚊蝇；改善环境卫生；深入开展劝止随地吐痰运动；预防煤气中毒和冬季多发病。第二个阶段除继续进行第一阶段的各项活动外，开展捕鼠运动。第三个阶段，开展捕雀运动，并且继续进行第一、二阶段的活动。第四阶段，补课和总结。
