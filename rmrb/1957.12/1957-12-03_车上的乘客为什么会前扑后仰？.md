Why Do Passengers on Vehicles Pitch Forward and Backward?

Why do passengers on a car (or trolleybus) lean backward involuntarily when the car suddenly starts, and lean forward involuntarily when the car suddenly stops?

Before explaining this, we can do a simple experiment: Put a ball on the ground. If you don't kick it, it will stay still. If you kick it hard, the ball will roll forward and roll far away before slowly stopping. Why is this? This is because every object has the characteristic of remaining stationary when it is at rest, and the characteristic of maintaining its motion when it is in motion (the reason why the ball slowly stops after being kicked is the result of the ground and air resisting its movement). This characteristic is called inertia in science.

When the car is not moving, the car is stationary, and the passengers are also stationary. If the car suddenly starts, the person's body is still trying to maintain its stationary state due to inertia, so they involuntarily lean backward. Conversely, when the car is moving, the passengers inside the car also maintain forward motion with the car. When the car suddenly stops, the person's body still maintains its forward motion, so they involuntarily lean forward. In short, it is all due to the effect of inertia.

There are many examples of inertia in daily life. For example, when we are walking and our foot is tripped, our body will lurch forward. Also, when buses, trolleybuses, and trains are approaching a station, they glide to the station using inertia, which also saves a lot of gasoline, coal, and electricity.

### 车上的乘客为什么会前扑后仰？

　  车上的乘客为什么会前扑后仰？
    为什么当汽车（或电车）猛一开动的时候，车上的乘客会不自觉地向后一仰；而当车猛一停的时候，又会不自觉地向前一扑？
    没说明这个问题之先，我们可以做一个简单的实验：在地上放一个皮球，如果不用脚去踢它，它会呆在那儿不动；如果用脚使劲一踢，球就会往前滚，滚到很远的地方才慢慢地停下来。为什么会这样呢？这是因为每一个物体在静止时，有保持静止的特性，在运动时又有保持运动的特性（皮球被踢出去后又慢慢地停下来，是因地面和空气对它的运动起了阻碍作用的结果）。这种特性，在科学上叫做惯性。
    当车没有开动的时候，车是静止的，乘客也是静止的。如果车猛一开动，人的身体却因为惯性的原理还在保持静止状态，所以不知不觉地就向后一仰；相反，当车在行驶时，车内的乘客也随着车保持向前的运动，而车猛一停，人的身体还保持着向前运动的状态，所以又不知不觉地向前一扑。总之，这都是由于惯性作用的结果。
    有关惯性的例子在日常生活中是很多的：比如，我们走路时，脚被绊了一下，身体就会向前扑。又如公共汽车、电车、火车快到站时，靠惯性滑行到站，这也节省了不少汽油、煤和电。
