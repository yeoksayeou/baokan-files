Mobilize the Masses to Ensure Safe Production: Speech by Representative Wang Jinsheng
　　(Advanced Producer of Jiaozuo Coal Mine) (Abstract)

　　Attending this conference makes me extremely excited and gives me deep thoughts. I am a worker by birth. My father was a miner who worked in the Jiaozuo Coal Mine under the rule of British and Japanese imperialism. Because the imperialists only cared about profits and did not care about the lives of the workers, he was almost crushed to death during labor. I started working as a drag worker in the mine at the age of nine. At that time, it was during the Japanese occupation. They treated workers like beasts of burden. We lived in cave dwellings, which leaked and collapsed when it rained, often causing deaths.

　　At that time, the Japanese stipulated that a worker had to produce four tons of coal every day. If you didn't complete it, they would beat you. We never even thought about safe production or labor protection insurance. At that time, there were no work clothes. Everyone wore a torn hat on their head, broken shoes on their feet, and worked naked. Accidents happened constantly. Workers died every few days. I was on the night shift at the No. 16 upper mountain in the west cave of the Wangfeng Mine and personally saw six people crushed to death in one coal fall. When a worker died, the Japanese only gave 300 yuan in puppet currency. The contractor skimmed off a layer, and the people handling the formalities skimmed off another layer. Only 100 yuan was left in the hands of the bereaved family, which was not enough to buy a coffin. They had no choice but to wrap the body in a mat and bury it. The family members were left unattended and displaced!

　　In 1945, Japan surrendered. At that time, everyone thought that the Kuomintang reactionaries were Chinese and might be better than the imperialists. Who knew that one hen's egg was worse than the last. In order to fight the civil war, they oppressed and exploited the working people and conscripted soldiers every day. To avoid being conscripted, some young workers and I sometimes worked underground for twenty-four hours without daring to come up. Sometimes we had no choice but to sleep in old boilers. That kind of situation was really like eating Coptis chinensis – we had bitterness we couldn't express.

　　Just when we were desperately calling for help, the Eighth Route Army came, and the Party liberated us. I can't describe how happy I was in my heart. In a word, we saw the light of day.

　　The Great Mine started work on the third day after liberation. I was full of energy and went to work on the first day and became a group leader. At that time, my skills were very poor. My father was afraid that I couldn't do it, but I said, "Let's do it. Now we are working for ourselves. If I don't understand, I'll learn from others." So I accepted the task of group leader.

　　At the beginning of the work, the Party proposed safe production. The administrative and trade union leaders repeatedly educated us to pay attention to safe production. I was very touched. I thought of the "coal blacks" in the old society, who were like pieces of meat sandwiched between stones, with no one caring about their life or death. Now we have become masters, and the Party and leaders are so concerned about us. We must do a good job in safety. I also thought of my father, who was almost killed in an accident. I realized that ignoring safety is not only detrimental to the country, but also makes my family uneasy.

　　In December 1948, the mine launched a production increase and conservation campaign. Many young people in my group launched surprise attacks. Once, near the end of the shift, the wheel workshop and my group did not coordinate well. The last cart was pulled too fast, and the cart derailed, scratching group member Zhang Jinming. After his mother found out, she criticized me and said, "Accidents can still happen after liberation. What will happen to my whole family of seven or eight people?" This gave me a great shock. But I didn't know how to handle it well, so I went to the Party and the trade union. The leaders told me that it was not enough to ensure safety and production for one person, and that we must organize the workers to pay attention. I thought, "That's right. A single hemp thread breaks when pulled, but ten hemp threads twisted into a rope are strong." So I organized the group members to visit Zhang Jinming every day, both to comfort him and to educate everyone. The group members said, "We have to pay attention to safety. If it's not safe, individuals will suffer, and the country will also suffer losses." From then on, safe production had a ideological foundation among the group members. The group had no accidents for a year, and I was rated as a first-class model worker.

　　In 1950, the Liu Jiuxue group in my mine had no accidents for one year and two months and was rated as a model group. The Liu Jiuxue safe production campaign was launched throughout the mine. I thought, "Liu Jiuxue is so old, and he can achieve long-term safe production. Why can't we?" I made up my mind to do a good job in the group's safe production. At that time, some workers did not have enough understanding of safe production. With the efforts of the whole group, we achieved a thousand days without accidents.

　　After we achieved this result, some group members had a "dizzy" attitude and became arrogant and complacent. Group member Li Dehong said, "Not to mention a thousand days without accidents, there won't be an accident in ten thousand days." Some individual group members were not energetic at work and even dozed off underground. When I saw this, I thought, "This is terrible. Accidents are lurking around us at any time. If we are not careful, something will happen." We held a group meeting in a timely manner, criticized the slack attitude. In addition, whenever an accident occurred in a brother team or group, we analyzed the cause of the accident and checked our own work. If we found any problems, we solved them.

　　At the end of 1953, in view of the characteristics of my mine, which was "high in gas" and "high in water inflow," the leaders decided to launch the "Two-ization" campaign (standardization and regularisation of safety rules among the masses) to ensure the regularisation of safe production. This was a new and important event. However, my group did not advance one meter in four shifts during the implementation. The group members could not accept it and said, "Can't we change a white steamed bun for a black steamed bun every day?" Niu Er said, "Although we were beaten and bullied in the British and Japanese era for decades, the rules were not so strict. The five fingers are not the same length." At that time, I realized that "Two-ization" was the concretization of safe production and also the requirement of the country. We must not dig and mine randomly as in the past. On the one hand, we organized a technical research group. I also personally took the lead in operations with Liu Jinshun and others, overcame difficulties, achieved the specification requirements, and broke the quota. Everyone saw the facts, and their enthusiasm increased. The "Two-ization" campaign was launched. During the campaign, everyone also created some experience. For example, prepare well before placing the shelf, and master "one straight and three good": (1) The coal wall should be straightened, (2) The pillar socket should be well made, (3) The beam socket should be well dug, (4) The beam and pillar openings should be trimmed well. In this way, efficiency is increased by half.

　　In production, we sometimes found that individual group members had poor labor discipline, and we needed a system. After discussion, everyone formulated attendance, meeting, and handover systems, and stipulated "six no handovers": 1. The socket is not qualified, no handover; 2. Changes in coal quality and gas conditions are not handed over; 3. Electric drills, gloves, and tools are not complete, no handover; 4. The shed pillars are not up to standard, no handover; 5. The situation of the roadway is not clearly explained, no handover; 6. No handover before the appointed time. In addition, there is a cross-operation system, which clearly divides labor and prepares for the handover: one person raises the empty car, one person prepares the mud and transports the splitting sheet, one person opens the wood, and one person prepares the track board material to lay the wooden board. The day shift digs the coal and transports the materials, so there is no idle time and production is balanced.

　　In this way, from March 1949 to October 1957, our group had no industrial injuries for eight years and seven months. Production efficiency was 0.3 meters per worker in 1950, and increased to 5.7 meters per worker in 1957. The number of people was reduced from 25 to 9, and the first five-year plan was completed 126 days ahead of schedule.

　　The second five-year plan is about to begin. In order to better build socialism and enable the working people to live a better life, I am determined to act in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee and the spirit of the conference resolution, conscientiously implement the principle of building the country with diligence and thrift, and continue to work hard with the group members on the basis of the existing work. Guarantee not to be arrogant or impatient. During the second five-year plan, no accidents will occur, no worker in the whole group will shed a drop of blood, and we will complete the plan of no accidents for thirteen years.

　　发动群众保证安全生产王金生代表
　　（焦作煤矿先进生产者）发言（摘要）
    参加此次大会使我万分兴奋，也有深刻感想。我是个血统工人，父亲是矿工，曾在英、日帝国主义统治下的焦作煤矿作工。由于帝国主义者只图利润不顾工人死活，在劳动中曾险些被砸死。我在九岁时就下井当拖工。那时是日寇侵占时期，他们把工人当牛马使用，住的是窑洞，下雨时连漏加塌，砸死人是常事。
    那时日本人每天规定一个工人要出四吨煤，完不成就打。什么安全生产、劳动保护保险连想也没想到。当时工作那有工作衣呀，大家都是头上戴顶破帽，脚上穿双烂鞋赤身光肚干活，事故是不断发生，三天两天就有工人兄弟死亡。我在王封矿西洞上山十六号夜班，亲眼看到一次落煤就砸死六人。工人死了日本人只给三百元伪币，大包工从中剥一层，办手续的再剥一层，到死难家属手中只剩一百元，连买棺材都不够，没法只好用席子一包就埋了，家属因没人管都流离失所了！
    1945年日本投降了，当时大家想国民党反动派总是中国人吧，比帝国主义可能好些，谁知鸡窝里出猫头鹰一窝不如一窝。他们为了打内战压迫剥削劳动人民，天天抓壮丁。我和一些年青的工人兄弟，为了避免被抓，有时在井下干二十四小时还不敢上来。有时没法只好睡在旧锅炉里，那种处境真是哑吧吃黄连有苦没处说。
    正在呼天天不应，叫地地不灵的时候，八路军来了，党解放了我们，我心里那种高兴劲简直是没法说，一句话见了青天啦。
    解放后第三天大井开工，我满身是劲，头一天就上了班并当了组长，当时我的技术很差，爸爸怕我干不了，我说：“干吧，现在是给自己干啦，不懂跟别人学嘛。”这样我就接受了小组长任务。
    初开工党就提出叫安全生产，行政和工会领导一再教育我们要注意安全生产。我很受感动，想到旧社会的“煤黑”，是四面石头当中夹块肉，死活没人管，现在成了主人了，党和领导又这样关怀，一定得把安全搞好。又想到我爸爸曾因发生事故险些死亡，体会到不顾安全不仅对国家不利，自家老少也不安。
    1948年12月，矿里开展增产节约运动。我组青年多搞突击，有一次快下班了，轮子工段和我组没很好联系，最后一车拉的太快，车脱了轨，擦伤组员张金明。他母亲知道后就批评我说：“解放了还能出工伤事故，我全家七、八口人怎么办？”给我的刺激很大。但自己不知如何处理好，就去找党和工会，领导告诉要搞好生产和保证安全，一个人是不行的，必须组织工人兄弟让大家都注意。我一想可不是，一根麻线一扯就断，十根麻线拧成绳力量就大了。我就组织组员们每天去探望张金明，一方面安慰他也教育了大家。组员都说：“可得注意安全啦，不安全个人痛苦，国家也受损失”。从此安全生产在组员中有了思想基础，小组一年没出事故，我被评为一等模范。
    1950年我矿刘九学小组一年零二月没出事故，被评为模范组，全矿开展了刘九学安全生产运动。我想人家刘九学年纪那么大了，人家能作到长期安全生产，咱为啥不能呢？我就下定决心要搞好小组安全生产。当时有的工人对于安全生产认识并不足。在全组的努力下，作到了千日无事故。
    我们取得这个成绩后，有的组员就有了“老妈坐飞机，晕头晕脑”的劲头，骄傲自满啦。组员李德红说：“别说千日无事故，就是万日也不会出事故。”个别组员有的干活不起劲，甚至在井下打瞌睡。我看到了就想，这不得了，工伤事故随时随地都埋伏在咱身边，一不小心就要出事。我们及时召开了小组会，批评了麻痹思想，另外，凡是兄弟队组发生事故，我们就分析发生事故原因，检查对照自己的工作。发现有问题就进行解决。
    1953年年底，领导根据我矿“瓦斯大”和“涌水量多”的特点，为了保证安全生产经常化，决定开展“两化”运动（规程群众化、经常化）。这是个新事大事。但我组在执行中四班没进一公尺，组员接受不了说：“每天拿白馍不能换个黑馍。”牛二说：“英、日时代干几十年活虽然挨打受气，但规矩没这严格，五个指头出来也不能一般齐。”我当时认识到“两化”是安全生产的具体化，但大家不接受，干着急没办法，我就去找党支书，支书让我坚持下去，并和大家商量，我们用个别谈话和小组讨论的办法，弄清了工程规格化就是安全生产全面观点，也是国家要求，决不能和过去一样乱挖乱采。一面组织技术研究小组，我又和刘金顺等亲自带头操作，克服了困难，达到了规格要求，突破了定额，大家看到事实，情绪高了，“两化”运动开展了。运动中大伙也创造了一些经验。如在搁棚前作好准备，掌握“一直三好”：（1）煤墙要刷直，（2）柱窝要打好，（3）梁窝要挖好，（4）梁柱口要修砍好。这样，效率提高半倍。
    在生产中有时发现个别组员，劳动纪律不好，需要有个制度。大家研究后，订了出勤制度、会议制度、交接班制度，订出“六不交接”1、窝头不合格不交接；2、煤质、瓦斯情况变化不交接；3、电钻、手套、工具不全不交接；4、棚柱不合规格不交接；5、巷道好坏情况交代不清不交接；6、不到钟点不交接。另外有交叉作业制度是在交接班时，明确分工进行准备工作；一人扬空车，一人搞炮泥运劈片，一人开木头，一人准备道板材料铺木板。上班老掘帮铲煤，运输帮运料，这样不窝工，生产均衡。
    这样我们组由1949年3月到1957年10月，八年零七个月没有发生任何工伤事故，生产效率1950年每工是0.3公尺，到1957年提高到每工5.7公尺，人员由原二十五人减到九人，并作到了提前一百二十六天完成了第一个五年计划。
    第二个五年计划就要开始了，为了更好建设社会主义，使劳动人民过更美好的生活，我决心按照中央的指示和大会决议精神去作，认真的贯彻执行勤俭建国的方针，在现有的工作基础上和组员继续努力。保证不骄不躁，在第二个五年计划期间，不发生事故，不让全组工人兄弟流一滴血，完成十三年不出事故的计划。
