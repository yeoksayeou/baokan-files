Was There Really a Bumper Harvest?
Jiangsu Cadres and Peasants Enhance Awareness Through a Great Debate on the Year's Harvest

    This newspaper reports that this year, Jiangsu's rural areas have achieved a bumper harvest exceeding that of 1955. However, the objective fact of the bumper harvest was once obscured by the departmentalism of cadres and the clamoring of wealthy middle peasants. Over the past three months, through the debate of "Is this year's harvest really good? Is it a slightly better than average year, or a bumper harvest year?" many cadres and masses have raised their awareness, reported real production figures, clarified the truth, and correctly handled the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual.
    This year, Jiangsu Province's various grain crops, with the exception of reduced production of some crops in some areas of southern Jiangsu and Xuzhou, have achieved bumper harvests for wheat, barley, early, mid, and late rice, double-cropping rice, miscellaneous grains, and soybeans. The province's 36 million mu of rice alone produced 1.1 billion jin more grain than last year, and 600 million jin more than in 1955. The province's total grain output reached over 25 billion jin, exceeding the highest target set in the state's First Five-Year Plan. The Provincial Rural Work Department recently surveyed 2,342 agricultural cooperatives and found that 26.8% of the cooperatives had reached or exceeded the income level of wealthy middle peasants.
    However, until recently, many rural cadres and masses did not acknowledge that this year was a bumper harvest year. Many cadres only saw the reduced production of summer wheat in some areas and did not see the bumper autumn harvest, and held departmentalism and tailism ideologies, and reduced the increased production figures at each level. Some agricultural cooperative cadres even took the lead in concealing production and privately dividing it, scolding those cadres who reported real production figures as "boasting" and flattering their superiors. Some wealthy middle peasants also spread rumors saying, "This year's grain grew well, but it hasn't been harvested."
    When provincial leaders inspected work in Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Huaiyin, and Xuzhou special districts, they conducted special investigations into whether this year's harvest was a slightly better than average year or a bumper harvest, and suggested that the Party congresses and three-level cadre meetings of Jiangdu, Hanjiang, Baoying, Huaiyin, and Huaian counties should launch debates on this year's harvest, advocate loyalty to the Party, and guide peasants to launch debates on the harvest issue. At the preparatory meeting for the recent Third Provincial Party Congress, the representatives of each county also discussed the production issue. Through discussions and listing the facts, the participating cadres unanimously admitted that this year's weather was more normal than in 1955, many areas did indeed achieve comprehensive bumper harvests, and many agricultural cooperatives achieved large-scale production increases.
    Over the past three months, rural cadres and the vast number of peasants in various regions have generally enhanced their socialist awareness and correctly handled the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual during the discussions on the year's harvest. After launching a debate on this year's harvest among peasants in Qiaotou Township, Taixian County, more than 2 million jin of grain were reported. After the debate in Yangzhou Special District, a total of more than 200 million jin of grain was reported. Suzhou, Yangzhou, and other special districts combined the debate on the year's harvest with debates on who benefits from concealing production and privately dividing it, and whether to use surplus from good years to compensate for poor years, making everyone realize the benefits of reporting real production figures and implementing the policy of using surplus from good years to compensate for poor years for the state, the collective, and the individual, and actively turning in public grain and selling surplus grain.

### 到底丰收了没有？　江苏干部、农民通过年景大辩论提高觉悟

　　到底丰收了没有？
　　江苏干部、农民通过年景大辩论提高觉悟
    本报讯　今年江苏农村已获得超过1955年的大丰收，但是大丰收的客观事实曾一度为干部的本位主义和富裕中农的叫嚣所蒙蔽。近三个月来，通过“今年年景到底好不好？到底是平年偏丰，还是丰收年景”的辩论，许多干部和群众提高了觉悟，报实了产量，弄清了真相，正确处理了国家、集体、个人之间的关系。
    今年江苏全省各种粮食作物，除苏南和徐州部分地区部分农作物减产外，大、小、元麦，早、中、晚稻和双季稻，杂粮和大豆等都获得了丰收。仅全省三千六百万亩水稻一项，即比去年增产了十一亿斤粮食，比1955年也增加六亿斤。全省粮食总产量达到二百五十亿斤以上，超过了国家下达的第一个五年计划的最高指标。省委农村工作部不久前划片调查了二千三百四十二个农业社，发现有26.8％的社已达到或超过富裕中农的收入水平。
    但是，不久以前，许多农村干部群众不承认今年是一个丰收年景。不少干部只看到部分地区夏熟小麦减产而没有看到秋熟大丰收，存在本位主义和尾巴主义思想，层层压低增产数字。甚至有些农业社干部还带头瞒产私分，骂那些报实产量的干部是“吹牛”拍上级的马屁。部分富裕中农也散布空气说：“今年粮食长得是不错，就是不见打”。
    省委负责同志在镇江、扬州、淮阴、徐州专区检查工作时，对今年年景到底是平年偏丰还是丰收作了专题调查，并建议江都、邗江、宝应、淮阴、淮安等县的党代会和三级干部会，对今年年景展开辩论，提倡对党忠诚老实，并要引导农民对年景问题展开辩论。在最近召开的全省三届二次党代表大会预备会上，各县代表对产量问题也进行了讨论。通过讨论和列举的事实，与会干部一致承认今年天时比1955年正常，许多地区的确都取得了全面的丰收，许多农业社都是大面积增产。
    近三个月来，各地农村干部和广大农民，在对年景进行讨论中，普遍提高了社会主义觉悟，正确处理了国家、集体和个人之间的关系。泰县桥头乡在农民中展开对今年年景的辩论后，就补报出二百多万斤粮食。扬州专区经过辩论，共补报出二亿多斤粮食。苏州、扬州等专区结合年景问题的辩论，还辩论了瞒产私分对谁有利？要不要以丰补歉等问题，使大家认识到报实产量，贯彻以丰补歉方针对国家、集体和个人的好处，积极缴公粮卖余粮。
