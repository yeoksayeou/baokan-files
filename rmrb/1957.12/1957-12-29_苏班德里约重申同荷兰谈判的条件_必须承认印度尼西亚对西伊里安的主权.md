Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 28th: Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio reiterated to the press today that an absolutely necessary condition for Indonesia to hold negotiations with the Netherlands is that the Netherlands recognizes Indonesian sovereignty over West Irian.

Subandrio said that it is practically unnecessary to say such things again, because he has repeatedly made similar statements.

Subandrio confirmed that the news that Indonesia wants to buy weapons from the United States is true. This matter has been raised with the United States for a long time, but so far no clear result has been obtained. He said that the government also plans to purchase weapons from Western and Eastern European countries, and this is not because the plan to purchase weapons from the United States is progressing slowly, but because the government pursues an independent and autonomous policy.

Subandrio also said that the government sent military delegations abroad to speed up the purchase of arms. He declined to say when these delegations went abroad and to which countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 28th: The Indonesian Ministry of Information and some newspapers in Jakarta have criticized the malicious propaganda by "The New York Times" and other American newspapers regarding the Indonesian people's anti-Dutch struggle.

In a radio broadcast on the evening of December 27, the Indonesian Ministry of Information said that the Indonesian government has warned against interfering in the dispute between Indonesia and the Netherlands, so as to avoid expanding the dispute. The Ministry of Information said: "The New York Times" and other American newspapers published news reports favorable to the Netherlands, and these reports "seem to be singing the same tune as the slanderous news spread by the Netherlands." The Ministry of Information warned in the conversation that this practice will poison the atmosphere and also arouse the anger of the Indonesian people.

The Indonesian Nationalist Party's "Indonesian Torch Daily" pointed out that "The New York Times" and other Western newspapers are vigorously promoting "trusteeship of West Irian." The newspaper said that the liberation of West Irian is an indisputable demand of the Indonesian people, and the argument of "trusteeship of West Irian" obviously cannot find a market in Indonesia.

    苏班德里约重申同荷兰谈判的条件
    必须承认印度尼西亚对西伊里安的主权
    新华社雅加达28日电　印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约今天再一次向报界表示，印度尼西亚同荷兰举行谈判的一个绝对必要的条件是荷兰承认印度尼西亚对西伊里安的主权。
    苏班德里约说，实际上已经不需要再说这样的话，因为他已经一再发表过类似的谈话。
    苏班德里约证实，关于印度尼西亚要向美国购买武器的消息是确实的。这件事已经向美国提出很久，但是到现在为止还没有得到明确的结果。他说，政府还计划向西欧和东欧国家购买武器，这样做并不是因为从美国购买武器的计划实现得很慢，而是因为政府奉行独立自主的政策。
    苏班德里约还说，政府派军事代表团到国外去是为了加速进行购买军火的工作。他拒绝说明这些代表团在什么时候出国和到那些国家去。
    据新华社雅加达28日电　印度尼西亚情报部和雅加达的一些报纸纷纷抨击“纽约时报”和其他美国报纸对印度尼西亚人民反荷斗争所进行的恶意宣传。
    印度尼西亚情报部27日晚间在发表广播谈话时说，印度尼西亚政府已经警告不要干涉印度尼西亚同荷兰的纠纷，以免纠纷扩大。情报部说：“纽约时报”和其他美国报纸刊载了有利于荷兰的新闻报道，这些报道“同荷兰所散布的挑拨是非的新闻报道似乎是一鼻孔出气的”。情报部在谈话中发出警告说，这种作法将会毒化气氛，而且还会激起印度尼西亚人民的忿怒。
    印度尼西亚国民党的“印度尼西亚火炬报”指出，“纽约时报”和其他西方报纸都在大肆宣扬“托管西伊里安”。这家报纸说，解放西伊里安是印度尼西亚人民的不容争辩的要求，至于“托管西伊里安”这种论调在印度尼西亚显然是找不到市场的。
