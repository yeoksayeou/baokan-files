　　Change the Indoor Air
　　Xue Wen
    In winter, in cold climates, outdoor activities decrease and indoor living time increases, which is a natural phenomenon. As long as a certain amount of outdoor activity time is maintained every day, generally speaking, it is not detrimental to human health. However, a problem needs to be paid attention to, that is, the indoor ventilation problem, so that the room always has a sufficient supply of fresh air.
    In order to maintain the body's life functions, people must breathe in oxygen from the air and exhale carbon dioxide produced in the body. Therefore, in the room where people live, if the ventilation is not good, the carbon dioxide gas in the indoor air will gradually increase, while the oxygen will relatively decrease, making the indoor air turbid and unsuitable for breathing. Although carbon dioxide is not toxic to the human body, the reduction of oxygen and the turbidity of the air are very unfavorable to the human body.
    Some people are afraid of the cold, so in winter, they always close the doors and windows tightly; even some tiny gaps in the doors and windows are sealed tightly. This practice is very bad for health. Especially in rooms with a stove, there is a greater risk of gas poisoning.
    How can we ensure that there is always enough fresh air in the room? This mainly depends on ventilation equipment. This kind of ventilation equipment is not complicated. Generally, for living rooms, as long as a vent (i.e., skylight) is left on the door, window, or wall, the ventilation problem can be completely solved.
    How big should the vent be? This is related to the size of the room, the number of occupants, the speed of air circulation, and whether a stove is used. Generally speaking, in the case of no fire, a room occupied by one person can ensure a sufficient supply of fresh air with a vent of about ten square inches. However, this refers to the case where the structure of the house is extremely tight. In fact, general houses have considerable gaps in doors and windows, and people open and close the doors from time to time when entering and leaving, which can solve part of the ventilation problem. Especially in the cold winter, the temperature difference between indoor and outdoor is large, the air flows quickly, the vent can be smaller, and it does not need to be opened frequently. It can be opened four or five times a day, and each time it can be opened for about half an hour. In addition, if someone smokes or does heavy physical labor indoors, the vent needs to be opened more times, and each time it needs to be opened for a longer time. Especially when a stove is used indoors, the vent needs to be opened frequently to prevent gas poisoning. When people are sleeping, the amount of air needed is less, so the vent can be opened smaller at night.
    The vent should preferably be a rolling window, so that the size of the window can be adjusted according to needs.

　　换换室内的空气
　　学文
    冬天，在气候寒冷的地区，室外活动减少，室内生活时间增多，这原是一种自然现象。每天只要能保持一定的室外活动时间，一般说来，对于人的健康并没有什么不利。但是有个问题需要注意，那就是室内的通风问题，使室内经常有足够的新鲜空气供应。
    人为了维持机体的生活机能，必须通过呼吸从空气里吸取氧气，同时把身体里产生的二氧化碳呼出去。所以在人常住的屋子里，如果通风不好，室内空气里的二氧化碳气就要渐渐增加，同时氧气就相对的减少，使室内空气变得污浊而不适于呼吸。二氧化碳对于人体虽然没有毒害，但氧气减少和空气污浊，对于人体却很不利。
    有些人因为怕冷，到了冬天，总是把门窗关得很严；甚至把门窗上一些微小的缝隙，也糊得严严的。这种作法，对于健康很不好。特别在升着火炉的屋子里，更容易发生煤气中毒的危险。
    怎样才能使室内经常有充分的新鲜空气呢？这主要靠有通风的设备。这种通风设备并不复杂，一般住人的屋子，只要在门、窗或墙壁上留个通气口（即气窗），就完全可以解决通风问题了。
    留多大的通气口呢？这和屋子的大小、住人多少、空气流通速度、以及是否生火炉等都有关系。一般说来，在不升火的情况下，一个人住的房间，有一个十平方寸左右的通气孔，就可以保证新鲜空气的充分供应。不过这是指房屋构造极其严密的情况说的，事实上一般房屋门窗都有相当空隙，人在进出时门也时开时关，这都可以解决一部分通气问题。特别是在寒冷的冬季，室内外温度相差较大，空气流动快，通气口就可以小些，而且不必经常开着，每天开四、五次，每次开半小时左右就可以了。另外，室内有人吸烟或者作重体力劳动，通气孔就需要多开几次，每次开的时间也要长些。特别是室内生火炉时，更需要经常把通气口打开，以防煤气中毒。人在睡眠时，需要空气量较少，所以夜间可以把通气孔开得小些。
    通气口最好采用卷窗的方式，以便根据需要，调节窗口的大小。
