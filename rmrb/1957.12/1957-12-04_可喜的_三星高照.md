Audience's Words

　　The Delightful "Three Stars Shine Brightly"

　　Who would like to spare a few hours to see the China Youth Art Theatre's performance of "Three Stars Shine Brightly"? Willing! That's great. This play will bring you good things. The story takes place in a locomotive repair factory, about improving a component to shorten the task completion time by more than two hours per shift. The workers launch a competition that starts without any formal mobilization.

　　You might say: Competition, competition… the same old stuff, what's there to see! No! The competition here is a competition of souls, a competition of love, a competition between the older and younger generations... and all the competitions are tightly woven into the resolution of contradictions between the advanced and the backward. What is lovable is the actors' simplicity, the director's meticulous design, to the point that it's hard to feel like you're watching a play during the performance; but it's not submerged in the clutter of daily life. Here is naturalness, simplicity, witty humor, full of a sense of humor. Don't we love to laugh? Laugh! Laugh out loud, smile, chuckle… there are plenty of opportunities to offer you. And it will make you think deeply after laughing, you will also launch a competition between an advanced me and a backward me!

　　Are there any shortcomings? Yes, the union secretary—a person with a larger negative side, although played with great energy and typicality, has no development from beginning to end. Such a person, in this competition, if not changing himself, would be kicked out. But at the end of the play, he is still calm and composed. In addition, the process of overcoming the old worker's ideological shortcomings is also too brief. But these do not dim the brilliance of the three stars. The three stars still shine brightly, this play is still a good play. How much we need, how much we need such scripts and performances that reflect the lives of workers.

　  可喜的“三星高照”
    谁愿意抽出几个钟头去看一看中国青年艺术剧院演出的“三星高照”么？愿意！那太好了。这个剧会给你带来好东西。事件是发生在一个机车修理厂里，为了改进一个机件使每班缩短两点多钟的时间来完成任务。工人们展开了一场没有发动就开展的竞赛。
    你也许会说：竞赛，竞赛……老一套，有什么看头！不是的！这里的竞赛，是人的灵魂的竞赛，爱情的竞赛，老一代与新一代的竞赛……而一切的竞赛，都紧紧地穿在先进与落后矛盾的解决里。可爱的是演员的朴实、导演的精心设计，以至演出时很难感到是在看戏；但又不是沉没在日常生活的芜杂中。这里是自然、淳朴、风趣横生，充满幽默感。我们不是爱笑么？你笑吧！大笑，微笑，失笑……都尽有充分的机会送给你。并且使你笑后还会引起深思，你也会以一个先进的我和一个落后的我展开一场竞赛！
    有没有美中不足？有的，那个工会秘书——一个消极面较大的人，虽然演的很够劲，也典型，可是从始到终，没有发展。这样的人在这场竞赛中，如果不是改变了自己，就是被踢开。可是戏的结局他还泰然自若。此外，那个老工人思想缺点的克服过程也嫌太简略了些。但这些，并不能使三星黯然。三星还是高照，这剧依然是好剧。我们多需要、多需要这样的反映工人生活的剧本与演出。
