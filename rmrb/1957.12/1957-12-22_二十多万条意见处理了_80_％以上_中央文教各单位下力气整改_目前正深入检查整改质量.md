    Reported by Our Newspaper: Central government organs and cultural and educational units are in the midst of a rectification upsurge, with most units currently conducting reviews of their rectification efforts.

    According to statistics from December 20th, the masses raised more than 270,000 opinions in the cultural and educational units during this period of great airing of views and great debate. Most units have now processed over 80% of these opinions, some have processed over 50%, and only a few have processed 30% to 40%.

    The cultural and educational units have achieved significant results during this major rectification and improvement, resolving a large number of general and specific issues. These general issues include matters related to welfare, professional work, the ideological work style of leading cadres, waste, and bad people and deeds.

    During this general rectification, many units also resolved some relatively significant problems. While rectifying, the Ministry of Education researched and formulated plans on how to implement the class line in general education, plans on conducting socialist education, and the 1958 teaching plan. During rectification, Beijing Hospital carried out revolutionary reforms to some unreasonable phenomena in the past medical system, and implemented a system where the families of senior cadres would be charged for medical treatment in all cases.

    This general rectification also saw some units resolve many problems that had been delayed for a long time. The Broadcasting Bureau had a serious problem of tape waste for a long time. During rectification, the masses proposed a unified tape management method, which could save the state at least 400,000 yuan per year and also save a large amount of foreign exchange. The Primary Education Department of the Ministry of Education accepted the opinions of the masses during rectification, and processed more than 500 pieces of exhibits that had been backlogged for seven years, and also discovered more than 100 boxes of books.

    The issue of the ideological work style of leading cadres in various units has been universally exposed and initially resolved during this general rectification. The Ministry of Culture conducted a top-down supplementary lesson on the issue of leadership style; in other units, most of the leading cadres who had been criticized by the masses also made preliminary self-criticisms.

    After this rectification, the ideological work style of leading cadres in various units has undergone a relatively significant change. Now, ministers and bureau-level cadres of the Ministry of Education generally participate in business meetings of relevant grassroots units. When the Teaching Section of the Secondary Normal Education Department discussed the 1958 teaching plan, Cui Jieping, the deputy director in charge of this section, personally participated in the meeting and made many specific suggestions, which the masses were very satisfied with. Many units have also established a system for leading cadres to receive the masses. Two Party member deputy directors of the Workers' and Peasants' Education Department of the Ministry of Education began to actively seek out ordinary cadres to talk to; they also used their spare time to talk to comrades who came to Beijing from various places to visit. During the talks, they discovered that some factories and mining areas had seriously neglected workers' spare-time education, and they reported these situations to the central government in a timely manner.

    After this general rectification, a new atmosphere has emerged in various agencies. The atmosphere of democracy and freedom in the agencies has been greatly strengthened, the enthusiasm of the masses has been greatly improved, the phenomenon of lax work discipline has been overcome, and phenomena such as procrastination and lateness in meetings have also been changed.

    There are still many problems in the rectification of various cultural and educational units. According to preliminary inspections, some units have been found to have false rectification phenomena. The Pharmaceutical Administration Department of the Ministry of Health received more than 400 opinions from the masses. During rectification, the department transferred some of the opinions to the Ministry and other departments for handling, and prepared to leave the remaining 240 opinions to be resolved next year or during the second five-year plan. The department believed that they had processed 100% of the opinions of the masses. After inspection by the Ministry of Health's Rectification Leadership Group, it was found that the actual amount of rectification by this department was very small. After the Ministry's leadership group's inspection, they concentrated their efforts to deal with it for three days and reached 70%. The rectification of some units is not thorough enough. The Primary Education Department of the Ministry of Education has 32 opinions that were planned to be resolved during the special airing of views. After inspection, it was found that 26 of these opinions could be resolved during this general rectification. The Xinhua News Agency's Administrative Office had 744 opinions left to be resolved in the special airing of views stage. This inspection found that 605 opinions can be resolved now. In this rectification, some units have also been rectified relatively roughly; some have been rectified unreasonably; some units have not carefully studied the opinions of the masses and have given irrelevant answers; and some units have missed the small problems raised by the masses.

    Now, most of the cultural and educational units of the central government organs are conducting reviews of their rectification efforts, and are preparing for future special airing of views and cadre downshifting.

    二十多万条意见处理了80％以上
    中央文教各单位下力气整改
    目前正深入检查整改质量
    本报讯  中央国家机关文教各单位整改形成高潮，大部分单位正对整改进行复查。
    根据12月20日的统计，文教各单位在这次大鸣大放中，群众共提出了二十七万多条意见，现在大部分单位已处理了80％以上，一部分单位处理了50％以上，只有少数单位处理了30％—40％。
    文教各单位在这次大整大改中，收到了显著的效果，解决了大量一般性的具体问题。这些一般性的问题包括生活福利、业务工作、领导干部的思想作风、浪费、坏人坏事等。
    在这次一般整改中，许多单位也解决了一些比较重大的问题。教育部在整改的同时，研究和制定了关于在普通教育中如何贯彻阶级路线的方案、关于进行社会主义教育的方案，1958年教学计划等。北京医院在整改中对过去医疗制度中的一些不合理现象进行了革命性的改革，执行了高级干部的家属治病一律收费的制度。
    这次的一般整改，有些单位还解决了许多过去长期拖延没有解决的问题。广播事业局的录音胶带，长期以来存在着严重的浪费现象，在整改中，群众提出了统一管理胶带的办法，每年至少可以给国家节约四十万元，还可以节省大量外汇。教育部小学教育司在整改中接受群众的意见，处理了积压七年的五百多件展览品，还发现了一百多箱图书。
    各单位领导干部的思想作风问题，在这次一般整改中得到了普遍的揭发和初步解决。文化部曾经进行了一次自上而下的关于领导作风问题的补课；在其他单位，凡是被群众提过意见的领导干部，也大多数做了初步检查。
    经过这次整改，各单位领导干部的思想作风有了比较显著的转变。现在教育部的部长和司局长级干部普遍参加有关基层单位的业务会议，中等师范教育司教学科在讨论1958年的教学计划的时候，主管这个科的副司长崔阶平亲自参加了这个会议，并且提了不少具体意见，群众很满意。许多单位还建立了领导干部接待群众的制度。教育部工农教育司两位党员副司长开始主动找一般干部谈话；他们还利用业余时间找从各地来北京参观的同志谈话，在谈话中，他们发现有些工厂矿区存在着严重的忽视工人业余教育的情况，他们把这些情况及时地向中央做了报告。
    经过这次一般整改，各机关都出现了一片新的气象，机关里的民主自由空气大大加强，群众的积极性有了很大的提高，工作纪律松弛的现象也得到了克服，开会拖拉、迟到等现象也有了改变。
    现在文教各单位在整改中还存在着许多问题。根据初步检查，发现有些单位整改有虚假现象。卫生部药政司群众共提出了四百多条意见，在整改中，这个司把一部分意见转给部和其他司处理，其余二百四十条意见准备留待明年或第二个五年计划期间解决，这个司认为他们处理群众意见已经达到100％，经过卫生部整风领导小组检查，发现这个司实际改的数量很小。在部的领导小组检查后，他们才集中力量处理了三天，达到70％。有的单位整改还不够彻底。教育部小学教育司有三十二条意见准备在专题鸣放的时候解决，经过检查，发现其中有二十六条意见可以在这次一般整改中解决。新华社行政处有七百四十四条意见留在专题鸣放阶段解决，这次检查有六百零五条意见可以在现在解决。在这次整改中，还有些单位改得比较粗糙；有的改得不合理；有些单位对群众的意见没有认真研究，答非所问；有些单位把群众提出的小问题漏掉了。
    现在中央国家机关大部分文教单位正在对整改进行复查，并且为以后的专题鸣放和干部下放做准备工作。
