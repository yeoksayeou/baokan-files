　　Can rice be grown in sandy areas?
    In the past, who could have believed that rice could be grown in the sandy areas of Inner Mongolia? However, in the past two years, the farmers in this area have been eating the rice they grew themselves.
    In the Yihutaga Gacha (township) and Bagetala Gacha (township) of the Left Rear Banner of Horqin, most of the land consists of rolling sand dunes. Mongolian farmers have historically only cultivated miscellaneous grains on the sand dunes through rotational fallowing, resulting in very low yields. Last year, after the realization of cooperativization, they cooperatively built ponds and canals in the marshlands, reclaimed wasteland to grow rice, and hired Han Chinese rice-growing experts from other regions to teach paddy field cultivation and other techniques. The rice paddy yields were almost four times higher than dry land yields. This year, due to rice cultivation, the economic lives of nine cooperatives have significantly improved. Recently, these nine cooperatives are stepping up the reclamation of marshlands, and the Banner People's Committee has decided to help farmers build a mechanical irrigation project here. The two townships plan to expand the rice fields to 445 hectares next year.
    Cooperativization has enabled Mongolian farmers to learn new production skills, and cooperativization has created miracles in the barren sandy areas.

　　砂丘地区不能种稻吗？
    从前，谁能相信内蒙古的砂丘地带能种水稻？可是，最近两年来，这地方的农民却吃到了自己种出来的大米。
    在科尔沁左翼后旗的伊胡塔嘎查（乡）和巴格塔拉嘎查（乡），大部分是绵延起伏的砂丘。蒙古族农民历来只是在砂丘上轮歇地耕种杂粮，产量很低。去年实现了合作化，在沼泽地合作修筑塘坝、渠道，开荒种水稻，从外地聘请汉族种稻能手来传授水田栽培等技术。稻田产量比旱田高出将近四倍，今年，有九个社因种水稻的缘故，经济生活显著上升了。最近九个社正在加紧开垦沼泽地，旗人民委员会决定在这里帮助农民兴建一处机械灌溉工程。两个乡计划明年把水田扩大到四百四十五公顷。
    合作化使得蒙古族农民学会了新的生产本领，合作化使得贫瘠的砂丘地区出现了奇迹。
