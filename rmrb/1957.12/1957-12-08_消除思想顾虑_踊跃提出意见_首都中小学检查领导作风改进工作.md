Eliminate Ideological Concerns, Actively Offer Opinions
　　Capital's Primary and Secondary Schools Inspect Leadership Style Improvement Work

　　(Report from our newspaper) Since the rectification movement began in Beijing's middle and primary schools, teachers and staff have been highly enthusiastic. The vast majority have actively offered various work-related opinions to school leaders and the Municipal Education Bureau in a spirit of ownership. These opinions are mainly expressed in the form of big-character posters, covering aspects such as the ideological style of school leaders, administrative management, education, teaching work, Party, Youth League, and trade union work, and general affairs. As of November 20th, 137 middle schools with 11,371 teachers and staff had joined the rectification movement, posting a total of 76,651 big-character posters and offering 310,809 suggestions; 13,028 primary school teachers and staff city-wide had participated in the rectification, posting a total of 68,711 big-character posters and offering 286,826 suggestions.

　　Before the start of the rectification movement, there were various ideological concerns among Party members, Youth League members, and the masses. Some Party members disagreed with posting big-character posters, believing that they were suitable for counteracting rightists but not for rectification. They feared that the masses' opinions would not be factual. Some Party members were prepared to be criticized. The masses had even more ideological concerns. Many teachers worried that big-character posters would expose their shortcomings to students, making them lose face. Many others feared being labeled as rightists for offering opinions. Some people lacked confidence in the rectification and were passive.

　　In response to these ideological situations, many schools, in addition to organizing everyone to study rectification documents, also did a lot of ideological groundwork. On the one hand, through general mobilization meetings, small group discussions, and other forms, they dispelled the ideological concerns of Party members and Youth League members, and called on them to play a exemplary role in the rectification movement, leading everyone to post big-character posters and expose shortcomings in their work. On the other hand, they held separate forums for teachers and staff, democratic parties forums, individual talks, etc., patiently explaining the significance, policies, and steps of the rectification to dispel everyone's ideological concerns.

　　With good prior preparation, most teachers and staff were able to actively offer opinions as soon as the movement began. After mobilization on November 23rd, all 154 teachers and staff at Dongdan District No. 24 Middle School posted 190 big-character posters on the same day. Within four days of hearing the mobilization report, 679 teachers and staff at Chongwen District Middle School posted 1,567 big-character posters. Among the big-character posters posted, the most opinions were about the ideological style of leading cadres and school education administrative work. There were also many opinions on Party and Youth League organizations, with most opinions focusing on the Party and Youth League organizations' insufficient ideological leadership over Party members and Youth League members, and insufficient concern for those applying to join the Party.

　　Currently, schools are responding to and resolving the opinions raised on various aspects of work. Middle schools are concentrating their efforts on inspecting the style of leading cadres. Party leaders from some schools, such as No. 4 Middle School, No. 25 Middle School, and No. 27 Middle School, have recently made preliminary self-criticisms to all teachers and staff. Wen Hanjiang, Principal of No. 4 Middle School, and Liu Tieling, Deputy Secretary of the Party Branch, made public self-criticisms at a general meeting of teachers and staff based on the opinions raised by the masses during the airing of views, which was well-received by the masses and encouraged the staff to continue offering opinions and improving work. As for opinions on administrative management and education and teaching, schools are acting on the spirit of "easy first, difficult later." Problems that can be solved immediately are being addressed, and problems that cannot be solved immediately are being studied.

　　However, in some schools, the airing of views is not thorough enough, and the masses still have concerns. Some schools are not handling the opinions of the masses seriously enough. These shortcomings should be noted.

    消除思想顾虑　踊跃提出意见
　　首都中小学检查领导作风改进工作
    本报讯　北京市各中、小学整风运动开始以来，教职工们的情绪非常高涨，绝大多数人都以主人翁的态度，积极地向学校领导以及市教育局提出各种工作方面的意见。这些意见主要是通过大字报形式提出来的，内容涉及到学校领导的思想作风、行政管理、教育、教学工作以及党、团、工会工作和总务工作等方面。截至11月20日，中学已经有一百三十七个学校的一万一千三百七十一个教职工投入整风运动，一共贴出大字报七万六千六百五十一张，提出意见三十一万八百零九条；全市已经参加整风的小学教职工有一万三千零二十八人，一共贴出大字报六万八千七百一十一张，提出意见二十八万六千八百二十六条。
    整风运动开始以前，在党团员和群众中有各种思想顾虑。有些党员不同意贴大字报，他们认为大字报用来反右派是可以的，用来整风就不合适，他们怕群众提意见不实事求是，也有些党员有准备挨整的思想。群众的思想顾虑更多，不少教师顾虑大字报揭露了他们的缺点，让学生看见，面子上不好看；还有不少人怕提意见被当成右派；有些人对整风没有信心，表现消极。
    针对这些思想情况，许多学校除组织大家学习整风文件外，还做了很多思想酝酿工作。一方面通过大会动员、小会讨论等形式，解除党团员的思想顾虑，并号召党团员在整风运动中要起模范作用，带动大家贴大字报，揭露工作中的缺点；一方面分别召开教师、职工座谈会，民主党派座谈会、进行个别交谈等，耐心地讲解了整风的意义、政策、步骤等，以解除大家的思想顾虑。
    事先准备工作做好了，运动一开始，绝大部分的教职工都能踊跃提意见。东单区二十四中在11月23日动员后，全校一百五十四个教职工在当天就贴出大字报一百九十张。崇文区中学六百七十九个教职工，在听完动员报告后，四天之内就贴出大字报一千五百六十七张。在所贴的大字报中，以对领导干部的思想作风和学校教育行政工作方面的意见为最多。对党、团组织提的意见也比较多，多数意见是党、团组织对党、团员的思想领导不够，对申请入党的同志关心不够等。
    目前，各学校正在对大家提出的各方面工作上的意见分别进行答复、解决。各中学正集中力量检查领导干部作风。部分学校如四中、二十五中、二十七中等校的党员领导干部，已在最近向全校教职工作了初步检查。四中校长温寒江和党支部副书记刘铁岭在全体教职工大会上，根据群众在鸣放中提出的意见进行了公开的检查，群众反映很好，鼓励了职工继续提意见和改进工作的热情。至于行政管理方面和教育、教学方面的意见，各校根据“先易后难”的精神，能够马上解决的问题已经着手解决，一时还不能解决的问题也正在加以研究。
    但是，目前有些学校鸣放得还不透，群众还存有顾虑。有些学校对于群众意见的处理还不够认真负责。这些缺点应该引起注意。
