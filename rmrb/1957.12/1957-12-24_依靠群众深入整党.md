    Rely on the Masses to Deepen Party Rectification
    By our reporter Ji Xichen
    Examining Party Members Through Debate
    Among the 146 Party members in Zhaodu Township, Jintang County, Sichuan Province, the vast majority have played exemplary and backbone roles in various tasks. However, during this socialist education movement, many problems within the Party have also been exposed. Specifically, these manifest as: serious right-leaning ideology, a lack of emphasis on implementing the Party's class line; and a failure to resolutely combat various unhealthy tendencies inside and outside the Party. Capitalist ideological behaviors and localism that disregards national interests have also become widespread. Serious selfishness and violations of law and discipline exist to varying degrees, and some Party members have lost their political enthusiasm and are unable to fulfill their role as Party members. In response to this situation, the general branch, following instructions from the county Party committee, consciously conducted an examination of the political situation of Party members throughout the entire socialist education movement. While boldly mobilizing the masses to speak out, all Party members were allowed to participate in meetings and speak out along with the masses, further exposing problems within the Party and the political attitudes of Party members. In addition to a few Party members who harbored doubts, resistance, and dissatisfaction with the unified purchase and sale of grain and collectivization, individual Party members even negated the achievements of socialism and attacked the Party's various policies. With the deepening of the movement, the general branch constantly paid attention to examining the political trends, stances, viewpoints, and ideological qualities of Party members, and promptly carried out education and sorting, so that the branch knew what was going on and prepared for Party rectification.
　  Carry out ideological struggle
　  In-depth Party Rectification Study
    On the basis of distinguishing between the major issues of right and wrong on the two roads, and in order to create conditions for the township's rectification work, the general branch decided to first carry out Party rectification. In view of the dispersed nature of rural Party members and the weakness of branch leadership, the general branch adopted the form of a Party member congress to conduct centralized Party rectification study. During the four-day Party member congress, Party members continued to speak out freely. In the 124 comments made by participating Party members on the leadership work of the general branch, they sharply criticized the branch for neglecting to ensure quality in the development of the organization, for not being thorough or specific in leading agricultural production, for neglecting the ideological education of Party members, and for shortcomings in leadership style. Based on these criticisms, the general branch gave explanations and conducted profound self-criticism. At the same time, in order to enlighten and educate Party members to conduct self-examination, the general branch also used the method of giving Party lectures, systematically educating Party members on Party member standards and Party discipline, explaining the purpose, significance, and principles of Party rectification, and requiring Party members to use the spirit of Party rectification to examine their own thinking and work style and raise their class consciousness. All Party members universally linked to personal thoughts, conducted examinations of capitalism, localism, individualism, and right-leaning ideas, and carried out mutual criticism and self-criticism. Those with serious errors and shortcomings were given key assistance. In response to the problems revealed, a combination of large and small meetings and in-depth and meticulous individual ideological education work was adopted to combat various unhealthy tendencies. Through these ideological criticisms, the class consciousness of Party members was raised and the direction of advance was further clarified.
    Patiently conducting ideological analysis and making appropriate criticisms are very important for helping Party members who have made mistakes to recognize their errors. When criticizing Party member Tan Daishu for making speculative business, because the leadership had not had sufficient individual talks with him beforehand and had not cleared his thinking, serious resistance and confrontational emotions occurred during the self-criticism. Some Party members even attempted to resolve his ideological problems in a simple and crude way. Learning from this lesson, special attention was paid to individual ideological education and fact-checking when criticizing Zeng Yongcai, a serious violator of law and discipline. All speakers were able to start from exposing specific facts and展开说理分析(unclear - elaborate on reason analysis), so that all Party members were deeply educated. Party members generally reflected that: "This Party rectification is like taking a bath, the more you wash, the cleaner you become. If you don't wash, we will forget that we are Party members."
    Listening to Mass Opinions and Strengthening Party-Mass Relations
    Before the start of Party rectification, the Party branch, in conjunction with speaking out freely, widely solicited opinions from the masses on Party members. However, some Party members, fearing a reduction in their prestige, fearing Party discipline, and fearing losing face, used the excuse that the masses did not understand the internal situation of the Party and were unwilling to listen to the opinions of the masses. In addition to repeatedly educating Party members to trust the majority of the masses, explaining the great significance of doing a good job in Party-mass relations for consolidating the cooperative and further developing production, the branch also actively encouraged and supported the criticisms made by the masses, and reviewed and answered the more than 400 correct and basically correct opinions raised by the masses to Party members. After the start of Party rectification, in order to further improve Party-mass relations and strengthen the ties between Party members and the masses, each branch specially convened a Party rectification meeting with the participation of non-Party cadres and mass representatives. At the meeting, because the branch sincerely and modestly solicited their opinions, they raised many criticisms and suggestions about the work of the branch and the style of Party members, such as criticizing Party member cadres for their undemocratic leadership style, not consulting with the masses on matters, a small number of Party members violating law and discipline, being selfish, and the branch failing to strengthen unified leadership, resulting in disunity between cooperatives and between Party members. In response to these opinions, in addition to the branch secretary representing all Party members, expressing welcome to the criticisms of the masses and the determination to correct them, some also had the Party group leader represent the Party members to make self-criticisms to the masses. Party members who served as cadres in the cooperative also sincerely conducted self-criticism on their shortcomings and errors at the members' congress and production team meetings respectively. Therefore, the masses generally reflected: "The Communist Party members are really doing things for us, and they can also make self-criticism to us when they make mistakes. They are really selfless!"
    Strictly Enforcing Party Discipline and Recommending Outstanding Party Members
    In order to strictly enforce Party discipline, the general branch organized Party members to study the document "Several Provisions of the Central Supervisory Committee of the CPC on Disciplining Rural Communist Party Members for Violating Party Discipline," so that Party members clearly understood how to abide by Party discipline. On this basis, in accordance with the principle of "being serious and earnest, and treating differently," Party disciplinary actions were taken against six Party members who violated Party discipline. When dealing with these Party members, the facts of the mistakes of the Party members who made mistakes were repeatedly checked and investigated, and the opinions of both the critics and the criticized were listened to, distinguishing between right and wrong, distinguishing between responsibilities, and correctly determining the nature of the errors. Then, Party members were fully allowed to appropriately discuss and decide on their punishments based on the policy boundaries for disciplining Party members. In addition to allowing Party members who were punished to state their reasons for appeal at the meeting, a special symposium was held to listen to their opinions, and the branch once again educated the Party members who were punished, pointing out the direction of their efforts. This spirit of "learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, and curing the disease to save the patient" not only educated the perpetrators themselves, but also educated all Party members.
    While criticizing mistakes, in order to establish role models by praising good people and good deeds, each branch universally recommended 24 outstanding Party members at meetings with the participation of mass representatives, based on the conditions of being active in work, selfless, caring for the hardships of the masses, having a firm stance, daring to fight against bad people and bad deeds, and resolutely implementing the Party's policies and branch resolutions. Comrade Liao Jiayong, secretary of the third branch and director of Zhongxing Cooperative, has always been active in his work, resolutely implementing the Party's policies, completing various tasks, and being able to care for the hardships of the masses, and actively helping poor households solve difficulties in production and life. This time, he was re-elected as director of the cooperative by a unanimous vote. Experience has proven that this method of Party rectification with criticism and praise is one of the effective methods for educating and improving Party members.
    Through Party rectification, the Party's combat effectiveness has been improved, and the ties between the Party and the masses have been strengthened. Many Party members have won the love and trust of the masses due to the improvement of their work style. In the election of cooperative and team leaders, 94% of Party members were elected by the masses as cooperative and team leaders. Party member cadres are more concerned about the hardships of the masses. When a five-guarantee household in Jia Ling Cooperative died of illness, Party member Zhang Shengyou and two others braved the heavy rain to bury the deceased and handle the aftermath, which deeply moved the masses. Party member Zhang Defa of Qixing Third Cooperative originally wanted to withdraw from the Party and the cooperative, but he improved his consciousness during Party rectification. He went back and actively worked, leading the members of the team to accumulate more than 300 loads of fertilizer in one day. Under the leadership of Party members, the whole township has launched a winter production upsurge, actively accumulating fertilizer, building water conservancy projects, and welcoming the great leap forward in production to increase grain production by one million catties next year.

    依靠群众深入整党
    本报记者　纪希晨
    通过辩论考察党员
    中共四川金堂县赵渡乡的一百四十六名党员中，绝大多数都在各项工作中起了模范骨干作用，但在这次社会主义教育运动中，也暴露出党内存有不少问题。具体表现在：严重的右倾思想，不重视贯彻党的阶级路线；对党内外各种不良倾向也没有坚决进行斗争。资本主义思想行为，和不顾国家利益的本位主义也普遍有了滋长。严重自私自利和违法乱纪的现象也不同程度存在着，有的党员丧失了政治积极性，起不了党员的作用。针对这种情况，总支根据县委指示，在整个社会主义教育运动的过程中，有意识的对党员的政治情况进行了考察工作，在放手发动群众鸣放的同时，让所有党员参与会议和群众一起鸣放，进一步暴露出党内的问题和党员的政治态度，除少数党员对粮食统购统销和合作化怀疑抵触不满外，个别党员竟否定社会主义的成绩，攻击党的各项政策。随着运动的深入发展，总支经常不断地注意考察党员的政治动向，立场观点和思想品质，及时进行了教育和排队，这样使支部作到了心中有数，给整党做好了准备工作。开展思想斗争
　  深入整风学习
    在分清两条道路的大是大非基础上，为给全乡整改工作创造条件，总支决定首先进行整党。鉴于农村党员分散，分支领导薄弱，总支采用党员大会形式，集中进行整风学习。在四天的党员大会中，党员继续大鸣大放，畅所欲言。与会党员在给总支领导工作提出的一百二十四条意见中，对支部发展组织忽视保证质量，领导农业生产不深入，不具体，忽视党员思想教育工作，以及领导作风上的缺点进行尖锐的批评。根据这些批评，总支逐条进行了解答和深刻的检讨。同时，为启发教育党员进行自我检查，总支又采用上党课方式，系统地对党员进行了党员标准和党纪教育，交代了整风的目的、意义和方针，要求党员用整风精神检查自己的思想、作风，提高阶级觉悟。全体党员普遍联系个人思想，对资本主义、本位主义、个人主义、右倾思想等进行了检查，开展了相互批评和自我批评，对有严重错误缺点的则进行重点帮助。针对揭露出的问题，采用了大会套小会，和深入细致的个别思想教育工作相结合的方法，同各种不良倾向进行斗争。通过这些思想批判，提高了党员的阶级觉悟，进一步认清了前进的方向。
    耐心地进行思想分析，恰如其分的批评对帮助犯错误的党员认识错误非常重要。批判党员谭代树做投机生意的错误时，由于领导上事先没有和他进行充分的个别谈话，未打通他的思想，以致检讨时发生了严重的抵触和对抗情绪，有的党员竟企图用简单粗糙的方式来解决他的思想问题。记取这一教训，后来在批判严重违法乱纪分子曾永才时，就特别注意了个别思想教育和核对事实的工作，所有发言的人都能从揭发具体事实出发，展开说理分析，使所有党员都受到深刻的教育，党员普遍反映说：“这次整风跟洗澡一样，愈洗愈净，不洗，我们就忘记自己是党员了”。
    倾听群众意见　密切党群关系
    整党开始前，党支部结合鸣放，广泛在群众中征求了对党员的意见。但是有的党员因怕降低自己的威信；怕受到党的处分；怕下不了台；借口群众不了解党内的情况，不愿意听取群众的意见。支部除反复教育党员相信群众多数，说明搞好党群关系，对巩固社，进一步发展生产的重大意义，同时还积极鼓励并支持了群众提出的批评，对群众向党员提出的四百多件正确和基本正确的意见，进行了检讨和解答。整党开始后，为了进一步改善党群关系，密切党员和群众的联系，各分支又专门召开了有非党干部和群众代表参加的整党会议，会上由于支部诚恳虚心的征求他们的意见，于是他们对支部工作和党员作风又提出了很多的批评和建议，如批评党员干部领导作风不民主、有事不和群众商量，少数党员违法乱纪、自私自利，分支部未加强统一领导，以致社与社、党员与党员之间闹不团结等。对这些意见，分支书记除代表所有党员，表示欢迎群众的批评和改正的决心，有的还由党小组长代表党员向群众作了检查，在社内担任干部的党员对自己的缺点错误，也诚恳地分别在社员大会、生产队会议上进行了自我批评。因此群众普遍反映：“共产党员硬是给我们办事的，有错误也能向我们检查，真是大公无私！”
    严肃党的纪律　推荐优秀党员
    为了严肃党的纪律，总支组织党员学习了“中共中央监委关于处分农村中共产党员违反党纪的几项规定”的文件，使党员明确了应如何遵守党纪，在此基础上，本着“严肃认真，区别对待”的方针，对六个违反党纪的党员进行了党纪处分。在处理这些党员的时候，对犯错误的党员的错误事实，进行反复的核对和调查研究，听取批评者和被批评者双方的意见，分清是非，分清职责，正确地确定其错误性质，然后充分让党员根据处分党员的政策界限，恰当地讨论决定其处分，被处分的党员除在会上允许其申诉理由外，还专门召开座谈会，听取他们的意见，支部再一次对受处分党员进行教育，指出努力方向，这种“惩前毖后，治病救人”的精神，既教育了犯错误的本人，又教育了全体党员。
    在批判错误的同时，为了通过表扬好人好事，树立榜样，各分支普遍在有群众代表参加的会议上，根据工作积极，大公无私，关心群众疾苦，立场坚定，敢于向坏人坏事作斗争，坚决执行党的政策和支部决议等条件，推荐了二十四个优秀党员。三分支支部书记、中兴社主任廖家永同志，工作一贯积极，贯彻执行党的政策，完成各种任务都很坚决，并且能关心群众疾苦，主动帮助贫困户解决了生产、生活中的困难，这一次又以全票连选连任社主任。经验证明：这种有批评、有表扬的整党方法，是教育提高党员的有效方法之一。
    通过整党，提高了党的战斗力，密切了党和群众的联系，许多党员由于改进了工作作风，取得了群众的爱戴和信任，在选举社、队领导中，94％的党员被群众选为社、队领导干部。党员干部更加关心群众疾苦，加凌社当一家五保户病故的时候，党员张声友等三人冒着大雨安葬和处理善后事宜，群众深受感动。七星三社党员张德发，原要退党退社，整党中提高了觉悟，回去积极工作，带领队上社员一天就积肥三百多挑。全乡在党员带动下掀起冬季生产高潮，积极积肥，兴修水利，迎接明年增产粮食一百万斤的生产大跃进。
