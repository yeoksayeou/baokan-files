Xinhua News Agency, December 26th. The State Council recently issued a "Notice on the Issue of Acquiring Scattered Railway Materials and Preventing Bad Elements from Stealing Railway Materials."

The notice stated that since the second half of 1956, due to the tight supply of steel in the country, a chaotic situation of raising prices and rushing to purchase scattered or buried railway materials has emerged in various regions. This not only resulted in the waste of sawing old rails with residual value into scrap steel, but more seriously, it triggered the bad behavior of some vagrants and bad elements along the railway lines stealing railway materials. This situation seriously threatens the safety of railway transportation.

The notice stated that in order to curb the current chaotic situation in the acquisition of railway materials and the possible theft, the following temporary provisions are made:

(1) People's committees at all levels must strengthen widespread publicity and education among the masses along the railway lines to cherish the people's railways and prohibit the theft and sale of railway materials; mobilize the masses to protect state public property; and severely deal with those who steal and sell railway materials.

(2) All railway materials within five kilometers on both sides of the railway line shall be collected by the Ministry of Railways; railway materials scattered or buried in urban and rural areas outside the above range shall still be collected and recycled by various departments and provinces (cities) and districts. However, in order to prevent the unreasonable phenomenon of treating old railway materials with residual value as scrap steel, the local railway department must be requested to send someone to identify them before disposal, and those with residual value shall be handed over to the Ministry of Railways for use; the part that can be treated as scrap steel shall remain with the original department or province (city) or district for use.

(3) In order to ensure that collectors receive reasonable remuneration, appropriate standards should be set for the purchase price.

    国务院发出通知
    改进铁路器材收购工作
    制止游民、坏分子盗窃铁路器材
    新华社26日讯　国务院最近发出“关于收购散置的铁路器材和制止坏分子偷窃铁路器材问题的通知”
    通知说自1956年下半年以来，由于国家钢材供应紧张，各地区出现了抬价抢购散置或者埋藏的铁路器材的混乱现象。不仅将尚有使用价值的旧轨锯断成废钢处理造成浪费，而且更严重的是引起了铁路沿线一部分游民和坏分子偷窃铁路器材的恶劣行为。这种情况严重地威胁着铁路运输的安全。
    通知说，为了制止目前在铁路器材收购工作上的混乱情况和可能发生的偷窃行为，特暂作如下规定：
    （一）各级人民委员会要对铁路沿线群众加强爱护人民铁路、禁止盗卖铁路器材的广泛宣传教育；发动群众保护国家公共财产；对于盗卖铁路器材者必须给以严肃的处理。
    （二）凡属于铁道沿线两侧各五公里内的铁路器材，统一由铁道部负责搜集，在上述范围以外散置或者埋藏在城乡的铁路器材，仍分别由各部门和各省（市）、区收集和回收，但是为了防止把尚有利用价值的旧铁路器材作为废钢铁处理的不合理现象发生，在处理前必须请当地铁道部门派人进行鉴定，将尚有利用价值的交由铁道部接收利用；可做废钢处理的部分，仍留原部门或省（市）、区使用。
    （三）为了使收集者得到合理的报酬，对于收购价格应该规定适当的标准。
