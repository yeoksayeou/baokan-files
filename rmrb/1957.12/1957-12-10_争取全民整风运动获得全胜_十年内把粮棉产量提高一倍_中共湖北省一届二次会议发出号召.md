Xinhua News Agency Special Dispatch: The Second Session of the First Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in Hubei Province, lasting ten days, concluded on November 30th. The meeting called on the entire party to conscientiously implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and lead the people of the province to strive for a complete victory in the rectification movement and to double grain and cotton production within ten years.

In his report on the rectification movement on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee, Zhang Pinghua, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, said that Hubei Province is currently in the midst of a high tide of socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. Judging from the situation in the province, the problem of "letting go" has now been basically solved, and the current focus should be on "transformation." This is a key to whether or not we can achieve a complete victory in the rectification movement, so we must transform things thoroughly.

Wang Yanchun, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, pointed out in his report on "Doubling Grain and Cotton Production" on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee that during the First Five-Year Plan period, all agricultural crops in the province, except for oil crops, overfulfilled their plans, and the achievements were tremendous. However, the potential for agricultural production in the province is still very large. To this end, in accordance with the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the requirements of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), the Provincial Party Committee has revised the original twelve-year plan for the development of agricultural production, requiring that grain and cotton production in the province be doubled on the existing basis in the next ten years (1958 to 1967). In the next three to five years, the production level of the vast majority of cooperatives should catch up with or exceed that of well-to-do middle peasants.

Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, made a concluding speech at the meeting. He emphasized that we should resolutely oppose conservative thinking at present, but at the same time, we must prevent blind adventurism. The experience of cadres in Hongan County and other regions in cultivating experimental fields should continue to be promoted throughout the province. In the future, the first secretaries of the Provincial Party Committee, the Prefectural Party Committees, and the County Party Committees should personally cultivate experimental fields.

Nearly two hundred representatives spoke and submitted written speeches at this meeting. The representatives also put forward criticisms and suggestions on the shortcomings of the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee.

　　争取全民整风运动获得全胜  十年内把粮棉产量提高一倍
    中共湖北省一届二次会议发出号召
    本报特约新华社稿　历时十天的中共湖北省第一届代表大会第二次会议已在11月30日闭幕。会议号召全党认真贯彻党的八届三中全会精神，领导全省人民为争取整风运动的全胜和在十年内把粮、棉产量提高一倍而奋斗。
    省委书记张平化代表省委在会上作的关于整风运动的报告中说，湖北省目前在政治战线和思想战线上正处在社会主义革命的高潮中。从全省的情况看，“放”的问题现在已经基本上解决了，当前的重点应放在“改”上，这是能否争取整风运动全胜的一个关键，因此必须狠狠地改。
    省委书记王延春代表省委作的“把粮、棉增产一倍”的报告中指出，在第一个五年计划期间，全省农业作物中除油料作物外都超额完成了计划，成绩是巨大的。但全省农业生产的潜力还很大。为此，省委根据党的八届三中全会精神和全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）的要求，对原来发展农业生产的十二年规划作了修改，要求在今后十年内（1958年到1967年）把全省粮、棉产量在现有基础上再增产一倍。在今后三年到五年内，要使绝大多数合作社的生产水平赶上或超过富裕中农。
    省委第一书记王任重在会上作了总结发言，他着重指出，当前应该坚决反对保守思想，但同时又要防止盲目冒进。红安县和其他一些地区干部培育试验田的经验，要继续在全省推广，今后省委、地委、县委的第一书记，都要亲自培育试验田。
    在这次会议上发言和书面发言的代表有近二百人。代表们还对省委领导上的缺点提出了批评和建议。
