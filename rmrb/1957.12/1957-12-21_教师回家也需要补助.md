    Teachers Need Subsidies to Go Home Too
    The regulations for employees to visit relatives do not include teachers and staff of schools, which is not comprehensive enough. Teachers and staff have winter and summer vacations every year, which are good opportunities to go home, but they cannot return home without travel expenses. I have not been home for seven years because a round trip costs 200 yuan, which I cannot afford. I hope the government will consider the specific difficulties of people like us and subsidize travel expenses for visiting relatives once a year or every two years. This can encourage the families of teachers and staff to return to their hometowns to engage in production, so as to reduce the burden on the cities.

    教师回家也需要补助
    职工回家探亲的条例不包括学校的教职员工，这不够全面。教职员每年有寒暑假，是回家的好机会，但没有路费仍回不了家。我七年没有回过家，就是因为往返一趟需要二百元，拿不出。希望政府考虑我们这些人的具体困难，每年或每两年补助一次回乡探亲路费。这样，可以鼓励教职员家属回乡生产，以减轻城市负担。
