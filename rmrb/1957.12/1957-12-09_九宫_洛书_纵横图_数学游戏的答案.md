　　Nine Palaces - Luo River Scroll - Magic Square
　  Answers to a Math Game

　　The diagram on the left is the answer to yesterday's "Math Game." Because viewed from the top, bottom, left, and right, it meets all the conditions of the problem, that is, the sum of the three numbers in the vertical, horizontal, and diagonal rows is fifteen. Therefore, it can be said that there are four ways to fill it out; however, the basic construction rule remains unchanged.

　　This figure is an ingenious creation of our ancestors and has a very long history. In the "Da Dai Li Ming Tang Pian", there is a record of "two, nine, four, seven, five, three, six, one, eight"; Bei Zhou Zhen Luan's annotation of Han Xu Yue's "Shushu Jiyi" on the "Nine Palaces Algorithm" says: "The Nine Palaces are, two and four as shoulders, six and eight as feet, three on the left and seven on the right, nine on the head and one on the foot, five in the center." All of these refer to this figure.

　　Because this figure has a marvelous structure, wonderfully created, some people believe that this is beyond human ability, attributing the credit for creating this figure to the gods. For example, attaching it to ancient myths and legends: when King Yu was controlling the floods, a large turtle emerged from the Luo River, and this figure was copied from the pattern on the turtle's back, so it is called the "Luo River Scroll." Furthermore, arranging the ten numbers from 1 to 10 together is called the "He River Map," saying that it was carried out by a dragon horse that jumped out of the Yellow River when Fuxi ruled the world. These attachments are of course unbelievable.

　　The legends about the "He River Map" and "Luo River Scroll" are frequently seen in ancient books, such as "Yi Xi Ci Shang Zhuan" which has "The He River produces the Map, the Luo River produces the Scroll, the sages follow them." "Shangshu Zhonghou" has "Bo Yu watched the He River, a tall man with a fish body came out, saying he was the spirit of the He River, and gave Yu the He River Map." "Bamboo Annals" has "The Dragon Map came out of the He River, the Turtle Map came out of the Luo River, with vermillion seal characters, and gave it to Xuanyuan." And so on. But what they actually looked like was never clearly recorded. However, linking the above figure with ancient legends was something that happened after the Northern Song Dynasty. For example, Zhen Luan called it "Nine Palaces" and did not know the name "Luo River Scroll."

　　In the "Xu Gu Zhai Qi Suanfa" compiled by Yang Hui of the Southern Song Dynasty, there are many "magic squares" similar to the above figure. The first diagram is our figure, and he already calls it the "Luo River Scroll." Yang Hui also proposed a method of making the diagram, saying: "Arrange the nine numbers diagonally, exchange the top and bottom, change the left and right, the four corners protrude." That is, first arrange the nine numbers diagonally: then exchange the top and bottom, left and right, that is: then extend the middle number on the four sides to the four corners to form a square, which becomes exactly the same as our figure. This method of construction is also very interesting. Think about it, can you come up with other orderly methods of construction? (Zhang Huaigu)

### 九宫—洛书—纵横图　数学游戏的答案

　　九宫—洛书—纵横图
　  数学游戏的答案
    左图就是昨天“数学游戏”的答案。因为从上、下、左、右四面来看它，都合乎问题的条件，即竖行、横行、斜行上的三个数字的和数都是十五。因此，可以说它可有四种填写方法；不过，基本的构成法则却是不变的。
    这个图形是我们祖先的精巧创造，历史非常悠久。在“大戴礼明堂篇”中就有“二、九、四，七、五、三，六、一、八”的记载；北周甄鸾注汉徐岳的“数术纪遗”的“九宫算法”说：“九宫者，二、四为肩，六、八为足，左三右七，戴九履一，五居中央。”都是指的这个图形。
    因为这个图形结构奇妙，巧夺天工，于是就有人认为这是人力所不能及的，把创造这个图形的功劳归之于神明。如附会上古神话传说：在禹王治洪水的时候，从洛水里出来一只大龟，这个图形就是按照龟背上的图形抄下来的，所以叫做“洛书”。又把从1到10的十个数字排列一起，叫做“河图”，说是伏羲氏王天下的时候，黄河里跳出来的龙马负出来的。这些附会当然是不足信的。
    关于“河图”、“洛书”的传说，虽屡见于古籍，如“易系辞上传”有“河出图，洛出书，圣人则之。”“尚书中候”有“伯禹观于河，有长人鱼身出，曰河精也，授禹河图。”“竹书纪年”有“龙图出河，龟图出洛，赤文篆字，以授轩辕。”等等。但究竟它们是什么样子，却都没有明确记载。而把上述图形与上古传说联系在一起的，却是北宋以后的事。如甄鸾就称它作“九宫”，而不知道有“洛书”的名称。
    南宋杨辉所辑录的“续古摘奇算法”一书中，有许多与上图相类的“纵横图”。其第一图就是我们这个图形，他已管它叫做“洛书”。杨辉还提出一种造图的方法说：“九子斜排，上下互易，左右相更，四维挺出。”就是先将九个数字斜排：然后把上下、左右互相调换，就是：再把四边中间的一子向四角挺出，成为正方形，就成了同我们的图形完全相同的样子了。这种造法也很有意思。想想看，您还能提出其它的有秩不紊的造法吗？　（张怀古）
