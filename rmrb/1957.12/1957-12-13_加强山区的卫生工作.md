Strengthening Health Work in Mountain Areas
　　By a commentator of this newspaper

    Since liberation, under the care and leadership of the Party and the government, significant progress has been made in health work in mountain areas. In addition to the general establishment of county-level hospitals, most mountain areas have district and township health centers, joint clinics, health stations and other basic health organizations. For example, Shaanxi Province has sixty-three counties and three hundred and four districts in mountain and old revolutionary base areas. It has sixty-three county hospitals (including five county-level hospitals), five county epidemic prevention stations, thirty-two county maternal and child health centers, three leprosy hospitals (villages), and two hundred and sixty-four district health centers. In addition, there are two hundred and four privately-run township health centers and two hundred and eighty-five joint clinics. Similarly, Shanxi Province has four hundred and eighty township health centers with over two hundred simple hospital beds attached, one hundred and seventy-three health stations, one thousand six hundred and seventy-three rural health stations, and five hundred and thirty-one joint clinics in mountain and old revolutionary base areas. Other provinces such as Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangxi have also generally established various basic medical and health institutions in mountain and old revolutionary base areas.

    However, due to the weak initial foundation and uneven work in various places, the medical resources in mountain areas are far from meeting objective needs, and medical and health conditions are more backward than in general rural areas, especially in some poor and remote mountain areas. Therefore, the current focus of health work in mountain areas should first be on poor mountain areas, especially old revolutionary base areas and poor mountain areas inhabited by minority nationalities, which should be given more care and attention.

    Further carrying out disease prevention and control work in mountain areas, especially the prevention and control of serious endemic diseases in mountain areas, should mobilize the masses to vigorously carry out the patriotic health campaign in mountain areas, strengthen health publicity work, and improve the health knowledge of the masses in mountain areas. Active investigation and research should be conducted on various diseases that are most harmful to the people and other diseases in mountain areas, and effective prevention and control measures should be taken according to the different incidence situations and possible conditions in various places. Disease prevention and control work must be carried out jointly by relevant departments under the unified leadership of the local Party and government. For example, the prevention and treatment of endemic goiter with iodized salt should be closely linked to the salt affairs, commerce, supply and marketing cooperatives, health and other departments to manufacture and supply in a planned manner; the prevention and treatment of leprosy should be carried out jointly by the civil affairs, agriculture, health and other departments. Prevention and control of other diseases should also be carried out in a planned and focused manner.

    Health institutions in poor mountain areas should be gradually strengthened, and the role of mass medical and health institutions and social medical forces should be fully utilized. In addition to the state gradually establishing some district health centers, local governments can consider adjusting district health centers in plain areas or areas with overlapping medical institutions to mountain areas lacking doctors and medicines; gradually transfer medical personnel with higher technical levels to supplement the health centers in mountain areas; qualified health centers can focus on setting up simple hospital beds to solve the treatment of acute and severe patients. County hospitals and specialized prevention and treatment institutions should establish close business and technical guidance relationships with health centers in mountain areas, so that patients who cannot be treated in mountain areas can receive treatment as soon as possible, and mountain medical personnel should be trained in a planned manner to improve their professional and technical level.

    Various places should take care of the economic difficulties of poor mountain areas according to possible conditions. In the allocation of maintenance funds for health institutions, various places should focus on taking care of health institutions in poor mountain areas to reduce the medical burden on local people. The medical reduction and exemption fees allocated by the government to old revolutionary base areas, minority nationality areas, poor families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and poor people every year are limited and cannot meet the needs of the vast mountain areas. The solution depends on the unified planning of the local government. In addition to the state gradually establishing some medical and health institutions, the role of mass health institutions and individual practicing doctors should be fully utilized. Government departments should mobilize them to participate in various medical and health work such as vaccinations, physical examinations, water conservancy construction, road construction, and disaster relief, and should give reasonable remuneration; provide loan assistance to those with difficult capital turnover; and help them rectify the situation separately for those with little business and economic difficulties that cannot be maintained.

    Health institutions in mountain areas must carry out their work in accordance with the characteristics of mountain areas, and should promote and promote various working systems and methods that facilitate people's access to medical treatment. For example, the combination of outpatient and mobile medical treatment adopted by health institutions in many areas, regularly and regularly going deep into various villages to see patients, is a better working method that adapts to the situation in mountain areas. This method of "delivering medical care to the door" not only facilitates people's access to medical treatment, but also greatly expands the business of health institutions, which is worth promoting in various places.

### 加强山区的卫生工作

　　加强山区的卫生工作
　　本报评论员
    解放以来，在党和政府的关怀和领导下，山区卫生工作有了显著的进展，除普遍设立了县卫生院外，大多数山区已经设有区、乡卫生所，联合诊所，保健站等基层卫生组织。如陕西省共有山区、老区六十三个县，三百零四个区，就设有县卫生院六十三个（包括五个县医院），县卫生防疫站五个，县妇幼卫生所三十二个，麻风病院（村）三个，区卫生所二百六十四个，另外，还有民办的乡卫生所二百零四个，联合诊所二百八十五个。又如山西省在山区、老区设有乡卫生所四百八十个，并附有简易病床二百多张，卫生站一百七十三个，农村保健站一千六百七十三个，联合诊所五百三十一个。其他如湖南、江西、广西等省的山区、老区，也普遍设立了各种基层医疗卫生机构。
    但是由于原来的基础很薄弱，各地工作也不平衡，山区的医药力量还远不能适应客观的需要，医疗卫生条件较之一般的农村落后，特别在一些贫瘠、偏僻的山区更为突出。因此，目前对山区的卫生工作，首先要把重点放在贫瘠山区，特别是革命老根据地和少数民族聚居的贫瘠山区应当给予更多的关心和照顾。
    进一步开展山区的疾病防治工作，尤其是山区严重的地方病的防治工作，应当发动群众大力开展山区的爱国卫生运动，加强卫生宣传工作，提高山区群众的卫生知识。对于山区各种危害人民最严重的疾病和其他疾病要积极进行调查研究，并根据各地不同的发病情况和可能条件采取有效的防治措施。疾病防治工作必须在当地党政统一领导下由各有关部门协同进行。例如用含碘食盐防治地方性甲状腺肿应当由盐务、商业、供销合作社、卫生等部门密切联系，有计划地制造供应；对麻风病的防治应当由民政、农业、卫生等部门协同进行。对其他疾病也要有计划、有重点地进行防治。
    应当逐步加强贫瘠山区的卫生机构，充分发挥群众性医疗卫生机构和社会医疗力量的作用。除了国家逐步建立一部分区卫生所外，各地政府可酌情调整平原地区或医疗机构重叠地区的区卫生所到缺医少药的山区去；逐步抽调技术水平较高的医务人员，充实到山区的卫生所；有条件的卫生所可以重点设置简易病床，以解决急重病人的治疗。县卫生院和专业防治机构要同山区卫生所建立密切的业务技术指导关系，使山区不能处理的病人尽快地得到治疗，并有计划地轮训山区医务人员，提高他们的业务技术水平。
    各地要根据可能条件照顾贫瘠山区的经济困难。在分配卫生机构的维持经费中，各地应当重点地照顾到贫瘠山区的卫生机构，以减轻当地群众的医药负担。政府每年拨给革命老根据地、少数民族地区、贫苦烈军属以及贫苦群众的医疗减免费用是有限的，不能满足广大山区的需要，解决的办法要靠当地政府的统一筹划。除了国家逐步建立一部分医疗卫生机构之外，应当充分发挥群众性卫生机构和个体开业医生等的作用，政府各部门动员他们参加预防接种、体格检查、兴修水利、筑路、救灾等各项医疗卫生工作，均应给予合理的报酬；对资金周转困难的给以贷款帮助；对业务少、经济困难无法维持的，应当分别情况，帮助他们进行整顿。
    山区卫生机构必须适应山区的特点进行工作，应当发扬和推广各种便利群众就医的工作制度和方法，如不少地区的卫生机构已经采取门诊与巡回医疗相结合，定期定点地深入各村看病，是适应山区情况的一种较好的工作方法。这种“送医上门”的方法，不但便利了群众就医，也使卫生机构的业务大大地开展，值得各地推广。
