Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 26th: The American journal "Foreign Affairs" published an article by Bader, president of the Near East Foundation, on the 19th, admitting that American policies are unpopular in the Middle East.

Bader said, "On some of the most decisive issues, the United States and the Middle East are essentially talking about two different things." Bader admitted that the policies pursued by the United States under the banner of "preventing the Soviet Union" have run into snags in the Middle East. He said that in the Middle East, people do not believe that Russia poses a threat. Bader said that U.S. policy toward the Middle East emphasizes "alliance." But what Middle Eastern countries are concerned about is national development, and they emphasize unity among Arab countries. Bader believes that it is difficult to make "any progress" in resolving these contradictions between the United States and Middle Eastern countries.

    美国“外交季刊”承认
    美国政策在中东不受欢迎
    据新华社26日讯　纽约消息：美国“外交季刊”19日刊载近东基金会主席巴杜的一篇文章，承认美国的政策在中东不受欢迎。
    巴杜说，“在一些最有决定性的问题上，美国和中东所谈的实质上是两回事。”巴杜承认美国打着“防备苏联”的旗帜奉行的政策在中东碰了壁。他说，在中东，人们都不认为俄国构成一种威胁。巴杜说，美国对中东的政策强调“结盟”。但是中东国家所关心的是国家的发展，它们强调阿拉伯国家之间的团结。巴杜认为，要解决美国和中东国家之间的这些矛盾，是很难“有什么进展”的。
