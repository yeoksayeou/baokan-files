　　Welcoming the Draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme
　　Shao Lizhi
    The draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, which we have long awaited, has been published by the State Council. This is a major event in our country's cultural and educational construction, a major event in our country's written language reform, and it is worthy of our warm welcome.
    In recent years, our country's written language reform work has been carried out in the following three aspects: simplifying Chinese characters and collating Chinese characters, promoting Putonghua, and formulating a Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme. Prior to this, in terms of character simplification and collation, the Scheme for Simplifying Chinese Characters and the First List of Variant Characters Subject to be Sorted Out had already been published. The promotion of Putonghua has achieved certain results and is continuing. Only the Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme had not been published, and everyone was waiting for it to be published soon. Now the draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme has been published.
    This draft was formulated after a long period of research, extensive discussion, and repeated consultation by language experts and people from all walks of life. The scheme adopts twenty-six existing Latin letters. The use of Latin letters to spell Chinese in our country has a relatively long history. Latin letters are very familiar to people in our country who have received secondary education or above. Scientific and technological books for their study and reading all use Latin letters. Adopting Latin letters is of great benefit to cultural exchanges between our country and the people of other countries. Latin letters are more convenient in writing, such as connected writing and cursive writing, than phonetic symbols. The scheme adopts a phoneme-based syllable structure, which is more accurate and flexible in phonetic notation and spelling than phonetic symbols.
    We can use the phonetic letters in this scheme to annotate Chinese characters and help people recognize them. Chinese characters are not phonetic writing; one cannot pronounce the sound simply by looking at the shape of the characters. Although many Chinese characters are pictophonetic characters, due to the evolution of Chinese character shapes and Chinese phonetics, pictophonetic characters cannot accurately represent the pronunciation of Chinese characters. For example, the two characters "江" (jiāng, river) and "河" (hé, river), "工" (gōng, work) and "可" (kě, can) are phonetic components, but now these two characters are not pronounced "工" or "可." This is unfavorable for the vast number of children and adult illiterates to learn Chinese characters, and also affects the popularization and improvement of culture and education. Therefore, we must have a way to solve the problem that the shapes of Chinese characters cannot represent their pronunciation. Using this set of phonetic letters to annotate Chinese characters can solve this problem.
    We can use this set of phonetic letters as a tool for correcting pronunciation in teaching Putonghua, helping to promote Putonghua. We all know that Chinese dialects are complex, and the pronunciation varies greatly from place to place. In order to further strengthen the political, economic, and cultural unity of the Chinese nation and smoothly carry out socialist construction, we must promote Putonghua. Also, because Chinese characters cannot represent pronunciation, to promote Putonghua, we cannot but use a set of phonetic letters as a tool for correcting pronunciation. The now-published draft phonetic alphabet scheme will greatly promote the smooth development of the work of promoting Putonghua.
    In terms of scientific and technological terms and the absorption of foreign words, we can now begin to study and try using Chinese phonetic letters. In scientific and technological terms, we translate the original text into Chinese characters, which is quite laborious. Now that we have phonetic letters, we can adopt the method of transliteration instead of using Chinese characters for semantic translation or transliteration. For some foreign country names, place names, and personal names that are already commonly used in our country, because there are already fixed Chinese character translations, we can consider not making changes. For some place names and personal names that are not yet commonly used in our country, we can directly spell them with phonetic letters, which can reduce the confusion and divergence in transliteration with Chinese characters.
    I also feel that after the publication of the draft phonetic alphabet scheme, illiterates who speak the same dialect or local language can use this set of phonetic letters to spell their language as a temporary tool for mutual communication, enabling them to initially escape illiteracy and providing them with great convenience in daily life, while also helping them to further learn Chinese characters.
    As mentioned above, formulating a Chinese phonetic alphabet scheme and carrying out written language reform work are of great benefit to our socialist construction. However, a small handful of right-wing elements, such as Zhang Bojun, slander and attack written language reform, saying that written language reform work is done behind closed doors by a few people without discussion. This is purely a blatant lie. The purpose of their saying this is not just to oppose written language reform, but to use the issue of written language reform to incite some intellectuals to oppose the Communist Party and the People's Government. From many facts, this is part of their anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist conspiracy, and we should expose their conspiracy.
    In summary, although the draft Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme cannot be definitively said to have reached perfection, given the current situation and conditions, the comrades of the Chinese Written Language Reform Committee have indeed made their greatest efforts. According to the current urgent need for a phonetic alphabet scheme, I personally believe that this scheme is very good. Of course, we still sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will actively participate in the discussion of this draft scheme, put forward opinions, and enthusiastically try it out.

### 欢迎汉语拼音方案草案

　　欢迎汉语拼音方案草案
　　邵力子
    我们期望已久的汉语拼音方案草案已经由国务院公布了。这是关系我国文化教育建设事业的一件大事情，这是我国文字改革工作的一件大事情，是值得我们热烈欢迎的。
    几年来，我国的文字改革工作是分作以下三个方面来进行的：简化汉字与整理汉字，推广普通话和制订汉语拼音方案。在这以前，汉字简化和整理方面，已经公布了汉字简化方案和第一批异体字整理表。普通话的推广工作已经收到一定的成效，现在正在继续进行。只有汉语拼音方案没有公布，大家都在盼望早日公布。现在汉语拼音方案草案已经公布了。
    这个草案是经过语文专家和社会人士长期研究、多方讨论、反复磋商之后制订出来的。这个方案采用了二十六个现成的拉丁字母。在我国用拉丁字母拼写汉语，已经有相当长久的历史。拉丁字母对我国受过中等以上教育的人来说，是很熟悉的。供他们学习和阅读的科学技术书籍中都用到拉丁字母。采用拉丁字母对我国与各国人民之间的文化交流有很大好处。拉丁字母在书写上，如连写、草写等，都比注音字母方便。这个方案采用了音素化的音节结构，这在注音、拼音方面也比注音字母准确、灵活。
    我们可以用这个方案中的拼音字母来给汉字注音，帮助人们认识汉字。汉字不是拼音文字，看了汉字的字形不能就读出音来。虽然有不少的汉字是形声字，但是由于汉字字形和汉语语音的演变，形声字并不能确切地表示汉字的读音。如“江”“河”这两个字，“工”“可”是声符，可是现在这两个字并不读“工”“可”。这对广大儿童和成人文盲学习汉字是不利的，也影响到文化教育的普及与提高。所以我们必须要有一个办法来解决汉字字形不能表示读音的问题。应用这一套拼音字母来给汉字注音，就可以解决这个问题了。
    我们可以用这一套拼音字母来作教学普通话的正音工具，帮助推广普通话。我们都知道汉语方言复杂，各地语音很不一致。为了进一步加强汉民族的政治、经济、文化的统一，顺利进行社会主义建设，我们必须推广普通话。也由于汉字不能表示读音，要想推广普通话，就不能不利用一套拼音字母来作正音工具。现在公布的拼音方案草案，将大大促进推广普通话工作的顺利发展。
    在科学技术名词和外来语的吸收方面，现在就可着手研究试用汉语拼音字母。在科学技术名词上，我们都是把原文译成汉字，费力不小。现在我们有了拼音字母，就可以采用音译的办法，不必再用汉字来意译或音译了。对一些已经在我国通行的外国国名、地名和人名，因为已有固定的汉字译法，可以考虑不再作改动，对一些在我国还未通行的地名、人名就可以直接用拼音字母拼写，可以减少用汉字译音的分歧混乱现象。
    我还觉得拼音方案草案公布后，在讲同一种方言土语的文盲中，就可以应用这一套拼音字母来拼写他们的语言，作为相互交际的暂用工具，使得他们初步脱离文盲的地位，使他们在日常生活中有莫大的方便，同时对他们进一步学习汉字也有帮助。
    如上面所说，制订汉语拼音方案，进行文字改革工作，对我们社会主义建设事业有很大的好处。而一小撮右派分子如章伯钧等，却污蔑和攻击文字改革，说文字改革工作是少数人关起门来搞的，没有经过讨论。这纯粹是睁眼说瞎话。他们所以这样说的目的，并不仅仅是反对文字改革，而是想借文字改革这一问题来煽动一些知识分子反对共产党，反对人民政府。从许多事实上看，这乃是他们反共、反人民、反社会主义阴谋的一部分，我们应当揭穿他们的阴谋。
    总起来说，汉语拼音方案草案虽然还不敢肯定地说是已经作到尽善尽美的地步，但就目前情况和条件看来，中国文字改革委员会的同志们确已尽了最大的努力。按照目前迫切需要一个拼音方案的情况来说，我个人确信这个方案还是很好的。当然，我们还是恳切的希望各方面人士积极的参加对这一方案草案的讨论，提出意见，并热心试行。
