Xinhua News Agency dispatch: After the socialist education movement was fully launched in the companies of the People's Liberation Army in most areas, the broad masses of soldiers actively participated in this mass self-education movement.

Since the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army issued relevant instructions to the entire army on September 4, soldiers of the army, navy, and air force have held various forums, speaking their minds freely and boldly expressing their opinions. Leaders and cadres of various units went deep into companies, platoons, and squads to listen to the opinions of soldiers and guide them in expressing their views. After the airing of views, the broad masses of soldiers conducted extensive debates on the superiority of agricultural cooperation, the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain and other agricultural products, the living conditions of workers and peasants, and the relationship between workers and peasants. Soldiers used methods such as presenting facts, reasoning, recalling, and comparing to distinguish between right and wrong in the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads.

During the debates, in order to analyze problems and distinguish between right and wrong, many companies invited local cadres, workers, and peasants to give reports to the troops. Some units organized large numbers of officers and soldiers to visit factories and rural areas. Some units sent work groups composed of soldiers to investigate rural production and living conditions in some soldiers' hometowns. Other units sent large numbers of officers and soldiers to rural areas to listen to peasants' socialist debates. They ate, lived, and worked with the peasants, listening to their debates while conducting their own debates.

The wall newspapers and blackboard newspapers of each company became a garden for soldiers to conduct debates, publishing various opinions of the soldiers and printing the letters of determination of each squad, platoon, and individual.

The socialist education in the companies, in a vivid and powerful form, raised the awareness of the broad masses of soldiers, enabling them to recognize the significant role of a series of national policies in the socialist revolution.

　  解放军全面展开社会主义教育运动后
　　士兵看问题看得又远又透彻
    据新华社讯　社会主义教育运动已经在中国人民解放军绝大多数地区部队的连队中全面展开。广大士兵踊跃参加了这一群众性的自我教育运动。
    自从中国人民解放军总政治部9月4日向全军发布有关指示以来，陆、海、空军各部队士兵，分别举行了各种座谈会，畅所欲言，大胆鸣放。各部队首长和机关干部深入到连、排和班，听取士兵意见，引导他们畅抒己见。鸣放结束后，广大士兵又对农业合作化的优越性，粮食和其他农产品统购统销政策，工人、农民的生活状况及工农关系等问题进行了大辩论。士兵们用摆事实、讲道理以及回忆、对比等方法，分清了社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争的大是大非。
    在大辩论中，为了分析问题、辨明是非，许多连队邀请了地方干部、工人和农民给部队作报告，有些部队组织了大批官兵到工厂、农村进行参观、访问，有的部队派出由士兵组成的工作组，到一些士兵家乡调查农村生产和生活情况，还有的部队派出大批官兵到农村倾听农民的社会主义大辩论，他们跟农民同吃、同住、同劳动，一边听农民辩论，一边自己进行辩论。
    各个连队的墙报和黑板报，成为士兵们进行辩论的园地，发表了士兵们各种不同的意见，刊载了各个班、排和个人的决心书。
    连队中的社会主义教育以生动有力的形式提高了广大士兵的觉悟，使他们认识到一系列的国家政策在社会主义革命中的重大作用。
