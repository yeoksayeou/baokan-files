Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd: According to TASS, Berlin, December 22nd: The German Communist Party issued a statement on December 21st via "904 German Free Radio Station" regarding the results of the NATO Paris meeting, condemning Adenauer for continuing to pursue a policy of atomic arms race.

The statement pointed out: While Adenauer verbally talks about striving for understanding and disarmament, he is simultaneously plotting to make West Germany an atomic and rocket base at the secret meetings of the NATO Military Committee.

The statement called on the people of West Germany to wage struggles within and outside parliament to strive for the establishment of a region in Central Europe where no atomic weapons are stored. The statement emphasized the importance of unified action by all trade union members, Communist workers, Social Democratic workers, Christian workers, and non-party workers in West Germany.

Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, December 23rd: According to a report by the Yugoslav News Agency on December 22nd, the Yugoslav State Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Popovic, stated in a conversation with reporters from the Polish "People's Tribune" and "Workers' News Agency" that he fully supports the Polish government's initiative and plan to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe.

He said that Yugoslavia, like many other countries, is in favor of a complete ban on the production, use, and storage of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons. "We are particularly firmly opposed to arming Germany, located in the divided heart of Europe, with these weapons."

Popovic said that arming the Bundeswehr (West German) with atomic weapons would intensify international tensions and create enormous difficulties for the resolution of the disarmament issue and the unification of the two parts of Germany.

    争取在中欧建立无原子武器区
    德共号召西德工人统一行动　南斯拉夫表示支持波兰建议
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社柏林22日讯：德国共产党21日在“九○四德国自由广播电台”就北大西洋集团巴黎会议结果发表声明，谴责阿登纳继续执行原子军备竞赛政策。
    声明指出：阿登纳在口头上高谈要争取谅解和裁军，但是同时又在北大西洋集团军事委员会秘密会议上策划使西德成为原子和火箭基地。
    声明号召西德人民进行议会内和议会外的斗争，争取在欧洲中部建立一个不存放原子武器的地区。声明强调指出了西德全体工会会员、共产党工人、社会民主党工人、基督教工人和无党派工人实行统一行动的重要性。
    据新华社贝尔格莱德23日电　据南斯拉夫通讯社22日报道，南斯拉夫外交国务秘书长波波维奇在同波兰“人民论坛报”和“工人通讯社”的记者谈话时，表示完全支持波兰政府关于在中欧建立不设原子武器地区的倡议和计划。
    他说，南斯拉夫像其他许多国家一样，赞成完全禁止生产、使用和储存核武器和热核武器。“我们特别坚决地反对用这些武器去武装位于分裂的欧洲中心的德国。”
    波波维奇说，用原子武器武装联邦（西德）国防军会加剧国际紧张局势，给裁军问题的解决和德国两部分的统一造成巨大困难。
