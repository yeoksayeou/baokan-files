　　Indonesian Workers Take Action
　　Take Over the Head Office of the Dutch Shipping Company
Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 3rd: Indonesian workers' representatives took over the head office of the Dutch Royal Rotterdam Lloyd shipping company in Jakarta at 10 a.m. today.

　　The workers' representatives met with the general manager of the Dutch company, read him the announcement of the requisition of the company, and asked him to sign his agreement. The general manager refused to sign and left the office with other Dutch staff.

　　The workers then lowered the Dutch flag at the company's head office and raised the Indonesian flag.

　　No incidents occurred during the workers' takeover of the company. Worker representatives guarded every office in the head office until the government authorities sent police to the scene.

　　The Indonesian Minister of Maritime Affairs told an Antara News Agency reporter that the takeover of the Dutch Royal Rotterdam Lloyd shipping company was not included in the ministry's plan. However, he said that since the takeover had already taken place, the Ministry of Maritime Affairs would take further measures to maintain traffic in an orderly manner.

　　Indonesian Minister of Information Sudibjo said that the West Irian Liberation Action Committee did not know about the takeover in advance. He said that the issue would be resolved by the Jakarta military authorities.

　  印度尼西亚工人行动起来
　　接管荷兰轮船公司总管理处
    新华社雅加达3日电　印度尼西亚的工人代表今天上午十时在雅加达接管了荷兰皇家轮船公司的总管理处。
    工人代表们曾经会见这家荷兰公司的总经理，向他宣读征收这家公司的公告，并且要求他签字表示同意。这个总经理拒绝签字，并且偕同其他荷兰籍职员离开了办公室。
    工人们接着在这家公司的总管理处降下了荷兰国旗，升起了印度尼西亚国旗。
    在工人接管这家公司的过程中，没有发生任何事故。工人代表看管着这个总管理处的每一个办公室，直到政府当局派警察到场为止。
    印度尼西亚海运部长对安塔拉通讯社记者说，接管荷兰皇家轮船公司并没有包括在这个部的计划里。但是，他说，既然接管工作已经施行，海运部为了有秩序地维持交通，将采取进一步的措施。
    印度尼西亚情报部长苏迪比约说，解放西伊里安行动委员会事先不知道这一接管行动。他说，这个问题将交雅加达军事当局解决。
