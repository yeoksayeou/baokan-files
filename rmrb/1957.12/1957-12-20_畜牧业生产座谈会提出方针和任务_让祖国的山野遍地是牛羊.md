Xinhua News Agency, December 19th: The Rural Work Department of the CCP Central Committee, the State Nationalities Affairs Commission, and the Ministry of Agriculture recently jointly convened a symposium on livestock production in pastoral areas. Vice Chairman Zhu De gave important instructions on livestock work at the meeting. Deng Zihui, Minister of the Rural Work Department of the CCP Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, gave a concluding report.

    The information gathered at the symposium indicated that China's livestock production has achieved great successes in recent years. By this year, the country had 84.27 million head of large livestock, 97.69 million sheep and goats, and 125 million pigs, all exceeding the highest pre-war levels and significantly higher than in 1949 and 1952. However, livestock production is not stable enough. The net increase rate of large livestock has been declining since 1955, and the number of large livestock this year is 1.5% lower than last year. In some areas, the burden on draft animals has increased due to the decrease in the number of large livestock. Among draft animals, there is an unfavorable phenomenon for agricultural development, with fewer young animals and more old, weak, and disabled animals than strong animals.

    In order to change the unstable state of livestock production and promote its great development, the symposium summarized and exchanged experiences and lessons in livestock work, studied the characteristics of various regions, and proposed guidelines and tasks for developing livestock production.

    Based on the characteristics and specific conditions of various regions, the symposium believed that the guidelines for developing livestock production in grassland pastoral areas should be: actively developing livestock production on the basis of actively and steadily carrying out socialist transformation, gradually changing nomadic grazing to settled grazing, implementing a combination of agriculture and animal husbandry (firstly, feed production), engaging in sideline production such as livestock product processing, and developing diversified economies centered on animal husbandry. The guidelines for mountainous pastoral areas should be: on the basis of striving for self-sufficiency and surplus in grain and oil, actively developing animal husbandry under the principle of not destroying soil and water conservation, and developing diversified economies combining agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations. The symposium pointed out that, regardless of grassland or mountainous pastoral areas, their tasks are: not only to develop livestock, but also to transfer livestock to other areas; not only to supply meat and livestock products, but also to provide draft and working animals to agricultural areas with insufficient animal power. General agricultural areas must overcome the phenomenon of insufficient attention to animal husbandry, fully recognize the interdependence between agriculture and animal husbandry, greatly develop animal husbandry, and gradually achieve self-sufficiency or partial self-sufficiency in the livestock they need.

    The symposium required that all regions must do a good job in protecting livestock to ensure they safely survive the winter, and at the same time immediately begin the work of regulating draft animals to solve the problem of insufficient draft animals in some areas and ensure that spring plowing can be carried out in a timely manner next year.

    This symposium was held from November 25th to December 7th. The meeting was attended by responsible persons from livestock departments of 14 provinces and autonomous regions, including Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, Gansu, Xinjiang, Sichuan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, as well as some counties, banners, and relevant central ministries.

    畜牧业生产座谈会提出方针和任务
    让祖国的山野遍地是牛羊
    据新华社19日讯　中共中央农村工作部、国务院民族事务委员会和农业部最近联合召开了牧区畜牧业生产座谈会。朱德副主席在会上对畜牧业工作作了重要指示。中共中央农村工作部部长、国务院副总理邓子恢作了总结报告。
    座谈会汇集的情况表明：几年来我国畜牧业生产获得了巨大成绩。到今年全国已有大牲畜八千四百二十七万头；绵羊、山羊九千七百六十九万只；猪一亿二千五百万头，都超过了战前最高水平，比1949年和1952年也都增加很多。但是畜牧业的生产还不够稳定，大家畜的纯增率从1955年开始出现了下降趋势，今年大家畜的数量比去年减少1.5％。有些地区，由于大家畜头数减少，耕畜的负担比过去加重。在耕畜中，出现了幼畜少老残多壮畜多的不利于农业生产发展的现象。
    为了改变畜牧业生产的不稳定状况，促进畜牧业生产大发展，座谈会总结和交流了畜牧工作中的经验和教训，研究了各类地区的特点，提出了发展畜牧业的方针和任务。
    根据各地的特点和具体条件，座谈会认为，草原牧区发展畜牧业生产的方针应当是：在积极而又稳步地进行社会主义改造的基础上积极发展畜牧业，逐步改游牧为定居放牧，实行农牧业结合（首先是饲料生产）兼营畜产品加工业等副业生产，发展以牧业为中心的多种经济。山地牧区的方针应当是：在争取粮食、油料自给有余的基础上，在不破坏水土保持的原则下，积极发展畜牧业，发展农林牧副业相结合的多种经济。座谈会指出，不论草原牧区和山地牧区，它们的任务都是：不仅要发展牲畜，而且要外调牲畜，不仅要供应肉食和畜产品，而且要对农业区畜力不足的地方提供耕畜和役畜。一般农业区必须克服对畜牧业重视不够的现象，要充分认识农业和畜牧业的相互依存关系，必须大量发展畜牧业，逐步做到所需牲畜自养自给或部分自给。
    座谈会要求当前各地必须做好保护牲畜安全过冬的工作，同时立即着手进行耕畜调剂工作，以解决部分地区的耕畜不足问题，保证明年春耕能够适时进行。
    这个座谈会是11月25日到12月7日举行的。参加会议的有内蒙古、青海、甘肃、新疆、四川、广东、广西、云南、贵州、河北、山西、陕西、吉林、黑龙江等十四个省、自治区畜牧部门以及部分县、旗和中央有关各部的负责人。（附图片）
