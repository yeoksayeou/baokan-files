　　Strengthen Unity, Support Each Other
  　Speech by Fu Zhong, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army (Abstract)
    The thirty-year combat history of the Chinese People's Liberation Army fully demonstrates that the absolute leadership of the Chinese Communist Party is the main source of our army's invincible power. The heroic and outstanding struggle of the Chinese working class has provided us with a good example. In the successive revolutionary wars and in the modernization of our army, the Chinese working brothers have given us tremendous assistance. Now, with the rapid development of our country's economic construction, our army has developed from a single-service arm into a combined army with various services and arms. At the same time, a strong air force and navy have also been built. In the past arduous revolutionary wars, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, which had to use inferior equipment to strike at superior enemies due to the lack of an industrial base, its excitement can be imagined when it received aircraft, artillery, automobiles and other weapons and equipment manufactured by our working brothers. Everyone is determined to use excellent combat training results to liberate Taiwan, an inseparable part of the motherland, and defend the socialist construction of the motherland, to answer the great support of the working brothers and the people of the whole country.
    With the active support and great encouragement of the Chinese working brothers, all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, in addition to completing combat training, defending borders and coasts, consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, etc., also actively participated in our country's economic construction by using all possibilities, and strived to save military expenditure in reducing the number of standing troops, adhering to diligence and thrift in army building, and rationally using various expenses, in order to accumulate more construction funds for the country, so as to accelerate our country's economic construction and establish our national defense cause on a more powerful economic foundation.
    Chinese working brothers and the Chinese People's Liberation Army have established a deep, flesh-and-blood class friendship in the long-term revolutionary struggle and production construction. In the future economic construction and national defense construction, our friendship will be further promoted. In the modernization of the People's Liberation Army, support from the working brothers is indispensable in terms of weapons and equipment, technical personnel, and other supplies; similarly, in carrying out production and construction, the Chinese working brothers can fully expect to receive strong assistance from the People's Liberation Army. The strong unity between the army and the people is a huge force for us to build and defend a socialist society and defend world peace.

　　加强团结　互相支援
  　解放军总政治部副主任傅锺致词（摘要）
    中国人民解放军三十年来所经历的战斗道路，充分证明了中国共产党的绝对领导是我军战无不胜攻无不克的力量的主要源泉。中国工人阶级英勇卓绝的斗争，给了我们以良好的榜样。在历次革命战争中，在我军的现代化建设中，中国工人兄弟给了我们巨大的援助。现在，随着我国经济建设的迅速发展，我军已从单一兵种建设成为拥有诸兵种的合成军队，同时，还建设了坚强的空军和海军。在过去的艰苦的革命战争中，由于缺乏工业基础，不得不用劣势装备来打击优势敌人的中国人民解放军，当得到了我国工人兄弟亲手制造的飞机、大炮、汽车和其他各种武器装备的时候，其兴奋的心情，是可以想见的。大家都决心以战斗训练的优异成绩，解放祖国不可分割的领土台湾，保卫祖国的社会主义建设，来回答工人兄弟和全国人民的伟大支援。
    在中国工人兄弟的积极支援和巨大鼓舞下，中国人民解放军的全体指战员，在完成战斗训练，保卫边防、海防，巩固人民民主专政等等任务以外，还利用一切可能，积极参加了我国的经济建设，并在减少常备兵员、坚持勤俭建军、合理使用各种经费等等方面，力求节约军费开支，为国家积累更多的建设资金，以加速我国的经济建设，使我们的国防事业，建立在更加强大的经济基础之上。
    中国工人兄弟和中国人民解放军，在长期的革命斗争和生产建设中，建立了深厚的、血肉相联的阶级友谊。在今后的经济建设和国防建设中，我们的友谊将更加发扬光大。在人民解放军的现代化建设中，无论武器装备、技术兵员以及其他供应方面，都离不开工人兄弟的支持；同样，在进行生产建设方面，中国工人兄弟完全可以指望得到人民解放军的大力援助。军民之间的坚强团结，是我们建设和保卫社会主义社会、保卫世界和平的巨大力量。
