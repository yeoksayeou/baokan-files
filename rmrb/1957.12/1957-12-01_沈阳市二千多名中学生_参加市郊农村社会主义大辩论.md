    More than Two Thousand Middle School Students in Shenyang
　　Participate in Socialist Debate in Rural Suburbs
    (Our Newspaper) Shenyang – As of November 28th, thirteen middle schools in Shenyang have organized more than two thousand students from the third grade of junior high school and above to participate in the socialist debate in the rural suburbs. This is an important measure taken by the Shenyang education department to strengthen students' socialist ideological education in conjunction with classroom political teaching.
    In order to strengthen the organizational work before students participated in the rural debate, the Culture and Education Department of the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee organized a collective lesson preparation for political teachers throughout the city on issues such as agricultural cooperation and the unified purchase and sale of grain. Political teachers and class teachers in many schools contacted agricultural cooperatives in advance to understand the progress of the rural debate. When organizing students to participate in the great debate, some schools selected several classes or students from a grade to participate in batches, while others selected student representatives from senior grades to participate, and then organized discussions and communication separately.
    Since political teachers in various schools had successively carried out a series of education on the issues of stance, the international situation, and agricultural cooperation to students in October, and some schools also invited rural cadres to give reports to students, the students were very enthusiastic when participating in this rural socialist debate. For example, students from Shenyang No. 35 Middle School participated in a four-day debate at the Gaokan Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in the eastern suburbs of Shenyang. In addition to participating in debates in various production teams at night, they also helped commune members with their work during the day. In order not to delay their studies, they also borrowed a place with the help of their teachers and took two classes.
    Many students took notes carefully during the debate. Students from Shenyang No. 4 Middle School also took the initiative to help farmers with detailed accounting during the debate. Four hundred students from Shenyang No. 23 Middle School rushed to Yangshitun Agricultural Cooperative, more than ten miles away from the school, on a snowy night and listened to the summary of the cooperative's great debate in the newly built club house. Before participating in the rural debate, some students from Shenyang No. 35 Middle School had a vague understanding of whether there was enough grain in the countryside, but since the students participated in the great debate, they have seen this problem clearly. In the Gaokan Village Agricultural Production Cooperative, there was a farmer named Wu Zhishang who clamored that there was not enough grain to eat. The commune members patiently reasoned with him with facts and carefully calculated the details. This guy, who had been a foreman under the puppet Manchukuo and had not been completely reformed, said that he needed one dan and four dou of grain a month on the first day, but then said that he needed nine dou the next day, contradicting himself. The students were very moved to see the commune members patiently reasoning with him and, on the other hand, severely exposing his deception and waste of grain. Xiao Wanzhu, a student who had doubted that there was enough grain, said: "This debate is more profound than the education received in textbooks. As long as grain is not wasted in the countryside, it is completely enough to eat. The road to becoming a rich peasant that Wu Zhishang wants to take is not feasible." Through the debate, he felt his lack of knowledge and lack of integration with reality, and expressed that he must work hard to learn from farmers and improve his awareness in the future.
    After students from thirteen middle schools across the city participated in the rural debate, the vast majority had a clear understanding of agricultural cooperation, saving grain, and participating in agricultural labor. For example, students who participated in the debates at the Yuhong Agricultural Production Cooperative in the western suburbs, the Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative in the southern suburbs, and the Gaotun Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in the eastern suburbs saw the improvement of the peasants' lives through the debates. Many peasants have eliminated illiteracy, used new agricultural tools, and the yield per unit area of cultivated land has been continuously increasing. They all deeply feel the superiority of the agricultural cooperation led by the Party. Therefore, some students made appointments with agricultural cooperative cadres after the debate, saying that after obtaining their graduation certificates, they would come to the cooperative to participate in labor.
    Currently, there are also thirty-three schools in the city that have not yet participated in the rural debate, and they will also organize students to participate in this activity in batches in the near future.

### 沈阳市二千多名中学生　参加市郊农村社会主义大辩论

    沈阳市二千多名中学生
　　参加市郊农村社会主义大辩论
    本报讯　沈阳市学校到11月28日为止，已有十三所中学，组织了二千多名初中三年级以上的学生参加了市郊农村社会主义大辩论。这是沈阳市教育部门结合课室政治教学加强学生社会主义思想教育的一项重要措施。
    为了加强学生参加农村大辩论前的组织工作，中共沈阳市委文教部曾组织了全市政治教员就农业合作化、粮食统购统销等问题，进行了一次集体备课。许多学校的政治教员和班主任，事先和农业社进行了联系，掌握了农村辩论的进度。在组织学生参加大辩论时，有的学校抽出了几个班或是一个年级的学生分批集中参加，有的学校则是在高年级班次中选出学生代表参加，事后分别组织讨论和传达。
    由于各校政治教师在10月份先后向学生进行了立场问题、国际形势、农业合作化等一系列的教育，有的学校还邀请了农村干部给学生做报告，因此参加这次农村社会主义大辩论时，学生们的情绪非常饱满。例如沈阳市第三十五中学的学生到沈阳东郊高坎村农业生产合作社参加了四天大辩论，除了晚上分别到各个生产队参加辩论外，白天还帮社员干活。为了不耽误学习，他们还在老师的帮助下，借了地方，上了二节课。
    许多学生在大辩论中，都认真做了笔记。沈阳第四中学的学生在辩论中还主动地帮助农民算细账。沈阳二十三中学的四百名学生曾在大风雪的晚上赶到离校十几里路远的杨士屯农业社，在该社农民新修的俱乐部里听了全社大辩论的总结。沈阳市三十五中学在参加农村大辩论前，部分同学曾对农村粮食够吃不够吃，有些模糊认识，但自从学生参加大辩论后，他们看清了这一问题。在高坎村农业生产合作社里有个嚷着粮食不够吃的农民武志尚，社员们拿事实，摆道理耐心和他算细账。这个曾经当过伪满工头尚未彻底改造的家伙，头一天说一个月要吃粮一石四，第二天却又说吃粮九斗，前言不对后语。学生们看到社员们耐心地和他说理，另一方面也狠狠地揭发了他的欺骗和浪费粮食现象，很受感动。曾经怀疑粮食不够吃的学生萧万柱说：“这次辩论比在课本上所受的教育还深刻，农村粮食只要不浪费，是完全够吃的，像武志尚所想走的富农道路是行不通的。”通过辩论，他感到自己的知识贫乏和不结合实际，表示今后一定要努力向农民学习提高自己的觉悟。
    全市十三个中学学生参加农村大辩论后，绝大多数对于农业合作化、节约粮食、参加农业劳动有了明确的认识。例如分别参加西郊于洪农业生产社、南郊红星农业生产社、东郊高屯村农业生产社大辩论的学生们，通过辩论看到了农民生活的提高，许多农民已经扫除了文盲，使用了新式的农具，耕地单位面积产量不断地增加，都深深地感到党所领导的农业合作化的优越性。因此有的同学在辩论会后就和农业社干部预约，表示拿到毕业证书后，就来社里参加劳动。
    目前，全市还有三十三所尚未参加农村大辩论的学校，他们也将在最近分批组织同学参加这一活动。
