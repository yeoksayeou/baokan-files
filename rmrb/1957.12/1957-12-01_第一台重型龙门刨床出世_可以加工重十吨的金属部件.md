Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, November 30th. The Wuhan Heavy Machinery Plant has produced its first heavy-duty planer-type milling machine during its trial production phase. Inspection has proven that the performance and quality of this milling machine are normal. Another planer-type milling machine of the same size and a forging hammer are being installed and will soon be completed.

The model of this planer-type milling machine is 7242A, weighing 36 tons, with a worktable length of six meters and a width of 1.5 meters, a cutting thrust of eight tons, and can process metal parts weighing ten tons.

Milling machines have a wide range of uses and can process flat surfaces, inclined surfaces, grooves, and more. According to the needs of the country, the Wuhan Heavy Machinery Plant will produce this model of machine in batches next year.

The Wuhan Heavy Machinery Plant began construction in February 1956 and is not yet fully completed. The three machine tools it produced this year were manufactured using some workshops of one main factory building and some equipment from some auxiliary workshops that have already been built. This year's trial production is mainly to create conditions for formal production next year.

　　第一台重型龙门刨床出世
    可以加工重十吨的金属部件
    新华社武汉30日电　武汉重型机床厂已经在试生产过程中生产出了第一台重型龙门刨床。经过验收证明，这台刨床的性能和质量都正常。另一台跟它同样大小的龙门刨床和一台锻锤正在安装，不久也可以制成。
    这台龙门刨床的型号是7242A，重三十六吨，工作台长六公尺，宽一点五公尺，切削推力八吨，可以加工重十吨的金属部件。
    刨床用途很广，可以加工平面、斜面、槽子等等。根据国家的需要，明年武汉重型机床厂将成批生产这种型号的机床。
    武汉重型机床厂于1956年2月动工兴建，现在还没有完全建成。它今年生产的三台机床，是利用已建成的一个主厂房的部分车间和一些附属车间的部分设备制造的。今年的试生产主要是为明年正式生产创造条件。
