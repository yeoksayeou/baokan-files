Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Through the rural socialist education movement, the vast majority of third-category cooperatives in Huang County, Shandong Province, have changed their backward state.

According to a recent survey by the Huang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, of the 347 agricultural cooperatives in the county, 31 were originally classified as third-category cooperatives. After in-depth socialist education, 29 of them have now changed their original backward state, with 10 of these even leaping into the ranks of advanced cooperatives in the current high tide of production.

The transformation of the third-category cooperatives is mainly the result of the ideological transformation of the cooperative cadres. In the past, the leading cadres of these cooperatives generally had more serious capitalist ideas. They were enthusiastic about engaging in private plots and doing business, and even engaged in sectarian disputes. The evil winds suppressed the righteous spirit, and the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of cooperative members could not be brought into play. During the great debate, the masses used the method of presenting facts and reasoning to thoroughly criticize capitalist ideas, enabling many cooperative cadres to solve long-standing ideological problems.

    黄县三类社改观
    据新华社讯　通过农村社会主义教育运动，山东黄县的三类社绝大部分改变了落后面貌。
    据中共黄县委员会最近的调查，全县三百四十七个农业社中，原有三类社三十一个，经过深入的社会主义教育以后，现在有二十九个改变了原来的落后状态，其中并有十个社在当前的大生产高潮中跃入先进的行列。
    三类社的转变主要是社干部思想转变的结果。过去，这些社的领导干部大都有比较严重的资本主义思想，他们热心于搞自留地、作买卖，甚至闹宗派纠纷，邪风压倒了正气，广大社员的生产热情得不到发挥。在大辩论中，群众用摆事实、讲道理的方法，对资本主义思想进行了彻底批判，使许多社干部解决了思想上长期未能解决的问题。
