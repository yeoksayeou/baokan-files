    From "Coal Blackies" to College Students
    — A Record of Coal Miners Studying at the Beijing Mining Institute
    Peng Lizhao
    As you enter the northwestern suburbs of Beijing, you can see magnificent buildings standing everywhere. This is the Beijing Mining Institute, one of Beijing's eight major colleges and universities, which is developing rapidly. Currently, more than 230 students from coal miner backgrounds are studying here. Just a few years ago, these students were coal miners from places like Kailuan, Huainan, Jiawang, Datong, Yangquan, Jixi, and Fushun.

    In the old society, coal miners were looked down upon as "dirty coal blackies," they could not get enough to eat or wear, and they had no access to education at all. After the founding of New China, in order to cultivate the backbone of technical cadres for the coal mining industry, the Party and the government selected a group of excellent coal miners from coal mines all over the country to study at coal miners' schools (formerly known as coal miners' and peasants' accelerated secondary schools). Afterward, they stepped into this institution of higher learning, studying in departments such as Mining Machinery, Mining Electrical Engineering, Mine Construction, and Coal Mining. Wang Guoju, a miner from Yangquan Coal Mine with more than ten years of experience, excitedly said to me, "In the old society, we were called 'dirty coal blackies,' and we never dreamed that we could go to college! Hundreds and thousands of coal miners going to college is a first in Chinese history!"

    Although these students from coal miner backgrounds had studied at coal miners' schools for three years and worked in the mines for several years, they still had many difficulties in learning professional scientific knowledge and theory. In order to overcome various difficulties in their studies, they displayed a spirit of hard study and perseverance, setting an example for coal miners to improve their cultural and technical skills and to conquer scientific fortresses. Wang Guoju, a coal mining student who became a miner at the age of seven, initially needed two or three hours to solve a single advanced mathematics problem. Later, he paid attention to improving his learning methods and gradually improved his academic performance. In the previous academic year, his exam scores included two scores of five and two scores of four. He said that descriptive geometry was very difficult, and the students called it "headache geometry," but the students were not afraid of difficulties. When they couldn't understand descriptive geometry diagrams, they used cardboard to fold models based on the diagrams to practice, and they understood after practicing several times. Xu Zhenlun and Zhou Zhidi, students in the Mining Electrical Engineering Department, also encountered many difficulties in their studies in the past, but they were overcome by their strong spirit of learning, and they gradually caught up with the pace of their studies. In the previous academic year, Zhou Zhidi received five scores of five, and Xu Zhenlun received two scores of five and two scores of four. These students from coal miner backgrounds, who found it difficult to remember chemical terms and their atomic valences, compiled these things into clapper rhymes and doggerel to help them remember. For example, they used the tune of "Singing Erlang Mountain" to compose the "Atomic Valence Song":

    "Hydrogen, potassium, sodium, chlorine, silver, bromine, they are monovalent,
    Oxygen, copper, lead, zinc, mercury, calcium, magnesium, they are divalent,
    Aluminum is trivalent, phosphorus is pentavalent,
    Nitrogen is divalent, tetravalent, and also pentavalent!
    Manganese is tetravalent and heptavalent!
    Iron is di- and trivalent…"

    They couldn't write block art characters on drawings, so they used their rest time to practice stroke by stroke on paper and on the ground, just like elementary school students learning to write, and even practiced on their bodies with their fingers in bed at night.

    In order to enable these students of worker and peasant origin to keep up with the progress of general students, in addition to regularly understanding their learning situation, the school leaders also provided convenient conditions, such as exempting them from Russian, assigning them to separate classes, providing more teachers, and assigning teachers to provide tutoring, which increased the number of tutoring sessions and provided convenient conditions such as borrowing instruments. At the same time, students exchanged experiences and helped each other, thus improving their learning methods.

    Many teachers at the Beijing Mining Institute regard cultivating technical cadres for the country's coal mines as their most glorious and pleasant work. Because of this, Lu Dahong, a teacher in the Electrical Engineering Teaching and Research Group, can care about the learning of worker and peasant students. He sometimes personally corrects errors in students' lecture notes, and even goes to student dormitories to provide individual tutoring. Wu Zhenchun, a teacher in the Electrical Engineering Teaching and Research Group, understands that students from miner backgrounds generally know how to use motors, but do not know the actual principles of motor manufacturing. During practical lessons, he patiently disassembled the motor and explained each component to the students, enabling them to quickly understand the principles of motor manufacturing. With the help of teachers, they quickly caught up with the progress of general students. More than 70% of them achieved scores of five and four in courses such as advanced mathematics, descriptive geometry, chemistry, and physics.

    These students from coal miner backgrounds love the new society, love the Communist Party, and have firmly established their class stand. When they saw the words and deeds of right-wing elements inside and outside the school who opposed socialism, they were very indignant and rose up to strike them head-on. Some students from coal miner backgrounds busied themselves writing big-character posters to refute them. The third-year miner class in the Coal Mining Department alone posted nearly twenty big-character posters refuting right-wing elements within an hour, launching a fierce debate against the right-wing elements in the school. They became the main force in the school's counterattack against the right-wing.

    These students from coal miner backgrounds have carried forward the working class's fine traditions of hard work and plain living in the school, and have also achieved good results in their studies, setting an example for general students.

    从“煤黑子”到大学生
    ——记在北京矿业学院学习的煤矿工人
    彭利钊
    一走进北京西北郊，就可以看到宏大的建筑物到处矗立，这就是北京的八大学院。为祖国培养煤矿工业高级技术干部的北京矿业学院，正在这里日新月异地发展着。现在已有二百三十多名矿工出身的学生在这里学习。几年以前，这些学生都还是开滦、淮南、贾汪、大同、阳泉、鸡西和抚顺等地的煤矿工人。
    在旧社会里，煤矿工人被轻视为“臭煤黑子”，吃不饱，穿不暖，根本没有受教育的机会。新中国成立以后，党和政府为了培养煤矿工业技术干部的骨干，在全国各地煤矿抽调了一批优秀的煤矿工人，到煤矿工人学校（过去称煤矿工农速成中学）学习。他们以后就踏进了这所高等学校，分别在矿山机械、矿山电机、矿井建设和采煤等系学习。来自阳泉煤矿的一位有十多年工龄的王国咀激动地对我说：“在旧社会里，我们被称为‘臭煤黑子’，做梦也想不到现在能上大学！成千成百的煤矿工人上大学，这在中国历史上还是第一次！”
    这些矿工出身的学生，虽然经过三年的煤矿工人学校学习和在矿山上工作过好几年，但是，他们对学习专业科学知识理论，还是有很多困难的。为了克服学习中的各种困难，他们发挥了刻苦钻研，坚韧不拔的学习精神，给煤矿工人树立了提高文化技术和攻克科学堡垒的榜样。七岁就当矿工的采煤系学生王国咀，开始做一道高等数学题需要两三个小时，后来他注意改进了学习方法，逐渐提高了学习成绩。他在上一学年的考试成绩，有两门是五分，有两门是四分。他说投影几何很难，同学们都叫它“头痛几何”，但是，同学们没有害怕困难。他们看不懂投影几何图，就用硬纸根据投影几何图来折叠成模型来比划，一连划好几次就理解了。矿山电机系学生许振伦和周志第，过去在学习上也碰到很多困难，但都被他们两人顽强的学习精神克服了，慢慢地就跟上了学习进度。在上一学年，周志第四门都是五分，许振伦有两门是五分，两门是四分。这些矿工出身的学生，对化学名词和它的原子价不容易记，就把这些东西编成快板和顺口溜来帮助记忆。譬如他们用“歌唱二郎山”的调子编成的“原子价歌”：
    “氢钾钠氯银溴，它们是一价，
    氧铜铅锌汞钙镁，它们是二价，
    铝三价来磷五价，
    氮是二价又四价，那个又五价！
    锰是四七价呀！
    铁是二、三价……。”
    他们在图纸上写方块美术字写不来，就利用休息的时间，像小学生学写字一样在纸上和地上一笔一划的练习，甚至到晚上在被窝里还用手指在身上练习。
    为了使这些工农出身的学生，跟上一般学生的进度，学校领导上除定期了解他们的学习情况外，还给予方便的条件，如免修俄文，单独给他们编班，多配备教师，指定教师进行辅导学习，这样就增加了辅导次数，以及借用仪器等方便条件。同时，同学们之间互相交流经验，互相帮助，因而改进了学习方法。
    北京矿业学院的许多教师，都把为祖国煤矿培养技术干部，看做是自己最光荣和愉快的工作。正因为这样，电工教研组教师陆大宏能关心工农学生的学习，他有时亲自给学生校正讲义的错误，甚至到学生宿舍里进行个别辅导。电工教研组教师吴震春，了解矿工出身的学生一般会使用马达，但不知道马达制造的原理的实际情况。在上实习课时，他耐心地把马达拆卸开，一个机件一个机件地讲给学生听，使学生很快就理解了马达制造的原理。他们就是这样在教师的帮助下，很快就跟上了一般学生的进度。他们的高等数学、投影几何、化学和物理等门功课，有70％以上的人获得了五分和四分的成绩。
    这些矿工出身的学生，都热爱新社会，热爱共产党，站稳了阶级立场。当他们看到校内外的右派分子反对社会主义的言论和行动时，都非常激愤，起来迎头痛击。有的矿工出身的学生忙着写大字报驳斥，仅采煤系三年级矿工班在一个小时内就贴出了近二十张驳斥右派分子的大字报，向校内的右派分子展开了激烈论战。他们成为学校反击右派的主力军。
    这些矿工出身的学生，在学校里发扬了工人阶级艰苦朴素的优良作风，在学习上也获得了很好的成绩，为一般学生树立了榜样。
