    Scientific Research Must Follow the Socialist Road
    Tsinghua University Science Discussion Clarifies This Truth

    (Our dispatch) The Second Tsinghua University Science Discussion Conference conducted reports and discussions on scientific papers, and also launched a heated debate on the two roads in scientific work.

    In this science discussion conference, various departments and teaching and research groups of Tsinghua University held thirty-seven academic discussion sessions, reporting a total of ninety-one academic papers. In these discussions, everyone discussed the academic papers and also evaluated them based on the principles of the socialist scientific road. Everyone unanimously agreed that the quality of the papers presented at this science discussion conference was higher than the level of the papers presented at the first science discussion conference, and the discussions were also more thorough. In this discussion conference, the proportion of papers on special research and production experiments increased from 50% in the first science discussion conference to 80%, and about 25% of the papers were of great significance to the national economy and teaching work, and had a high scientific level. These papers have been well received and valued by industrial departments, scientific research institutions and teachers. The authors of these papers include not only professors with rich research experience, but also newly grown young lecturers and teaching assistants.

    In this science discussion conference, all teachers launched a great debate on the two roads in scientific research work. Through presenting facts and reasoning, they not only exposed the shortcomings and problems existing in the work, but also distinguished right from wrong, raised awareness, and launched mass criticism and self-criticism.

    Through the ideological debate in this science discussion conference, everyone deeply felt the importance of correcting the political direction in scientific research work. Correcting the political direction means firmly taking the socialist road, and the Party's leadership is the most important guarantee of the socialist direction. Many facts show that without taking the socialist road under the leadership of the Party, one will inevitably take the capitalist road, and there is no middle road. Once scientific research work embarks on the wrong bourgeois road, not only will scientific research work not be carried out correctly, but teaching work and ideological education work will also suffer serious impact and losses.

    Through this discussion, everyone also deeply felt the seriousness and harm of theory being divorced from practice. Due to the relationship between the old Chinese social system and economic conditions, the divorce of theory from practice was a common phenomenon in the old Chinese science and technology circles, but many people have not given it enough attention. Through this discussion, many teachers are determined to put aside their airs and use actions in future practical work to overcome their own partiality in knowledge and the shortcomings of having more book knowledge and less production knowledge.

    Through this discussion, everyone also deeply realized that the relationship between teaching work and scientific research work is an important issue for universities. Incorrectly handling this relationship will lead to both scientific research work and teaching work suffering. Everyone unanimously agreed that teachers must complete the teaching task as their primary task, and at the same time, vigorously carry out scientific research work on the premise of completing and ensuring the continuous improvement of teaching quality. Facts have proved that under the correct combination of teaching work and scientific research work, not only can good technical forces be trained for the country, but also scientific problems can be solved for the country, and at the same time, they themselves can achieve rapid and healthy growth.

    Through this discussion, everyone also further realized the necessity and importance of ideological transformation, and recognized the harm of bourgeois ideology. "Being expert before being red" is essentially wanting to be expert but not red. The result of not being red is that one cannot become an expert either. If one does not take the all-round development socialist road of wholeheartedly serving the people and combining theory with practice, one will inevitably take the capitalist road of wholeheartedly striving for personal interests and being divorced from theory.

    This discussion conference ended on the 21st.

### 科学研究必须走社会主义道路  清华大学科学讨论会辨明了这条真理

    科学研究必须走社会主义道路
    清华大学科学讨论会辨明了这条真理
    本报讯　清华大学第二次科学讨论会，进行了科学论文的报告及讨论，同时也热烈地展开了科学工作中的两条道路的辩论。
    在这次科学讨论会中，清华大学各系及教研组分别进行了三十七次学术讨论会，共报告了九十一篇学术论文。在这些讨论会中，大家对学术论文进行了讨论，而且根据社会主义科学道路的原则也对这些学术论文提出了评价。大家一致认为这次科学讨论会所提出的论文的质量比第一次科学讨论会上提出的论文水平要高，讨论的也比较充分。在这次讨论会中，专题研究及生产试验性的论文已从第一次科学讨论会的50％增加到80％，并且有25％左右的论文对国民经济及教学工作有较大的意义，有较高的科学水平。这些论文均得到了产业部门、科学研究机关和教师们的好评及重视。这些论文的作者中，不但有富有研究经验的教授，同时也有新成长的年轻讲师和助教。
    在这次科学讨论会中，全体教师展开了科学研究工作中的两条道路的大辩论。通过摆事实，讲道理的方式，不但揭发了工作中存在的缺点及问题，而且辨明了是非，提高了认识，展开了群众性的批评及自我批评。
    通过这次科学讨论会的思想辩论，大家深深感到在科学研究工作中端正政治方向的重要性。端正政治方向也就是坚定走社会主义道路，而党的领导又是社会主义方向的最重要的保证。很多事实说明，不在党的领导下走社会主义道路，就必然走资本主义道路，中间道路是没有的，而且一旦科学研究工作走上了错误的资产阶级道路，不但科学研究工作不能得到正确的开展，教学工作和思想教育工作也会受到严重的影响及损失。
    经过这次讨论，大家也深深感到理论脱离实际的严重性及危害性。由于旧中国社会制度及经济条件的关系，理论脱离实际是旧中国科学技术界的普遍现象，但很多人一直并没有给以足够的重视。通过这次讨论，很多教师决心放下架子在今后的实际工作中用行动来克服自己知识上的片面性，书本知识多而生产知识少的缺点。
    经过这次讨论，大家也深刻体会到教学工作和科学研究工作的关系是高等学校的一个重要问题。不正确地处理了这个关系时，科学研究工作及教学工作就会两败俱伤。大家一致认为教师必须把教学任务当作自己第一位的任务来完成，同时在完成并保证不断提高教学质量的前提下，大力开展科学研究工作。事实证明，在教学工作与科学研究工作正确结合的条件下，不但可以为国家培养好的技术力量，而且也可以为国家解决科学问题，同时自己也获得了迅速而健康的成长。
    经过这次讨论，大家也进一步体会了思想改造的必要性及重要性，认识了资产阶级思想的危害性。要先专后红实质是要专不要红，不要红的结果是专也专不起来。不走全心全意为人民服务的理论联系实际的全面发展的社会主义道路，就必然走一心一意为个人利益奋斗的理论脱离实际的资本主义道路。
    这次讨论会已于21日结束。
