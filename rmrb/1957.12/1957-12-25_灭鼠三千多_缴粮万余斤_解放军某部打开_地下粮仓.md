    (Reported by our newspaper) A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, in active response to the state's call for vigorously conserving grain, combined the elimination of rats with solving the problem of two months' worth of pig feed for 200 pigs. They used their rest time to take shovels and baskets to dig rat holes in the fields near their station, both to eliminate rat infestation and to dig for grain. In the past half month, they have dug up 16,549 jin of grain (corn and soybeans) and killed over 3,200 rats.

    One day, Li Zhuxiu and four others went to the soybean and corn fields to dig grain from rat holes to use as pig feed. They dug six rat holes and unearthed 110 jin of soybeans. The next day, they dug up 109 jin of grain from five rat holes. The discovery of the "underground granary" quickly spread throughout the unit. In four or five days, just two squads dug up 1,719 jin of grain.

    They discovered while digging rat holes that rats mostly live in scattered locations along the edges of soybean and corn fields and on field ridges; they are also in the furrows, but less frequently. Generally, large rat holes contain as much as thirty or forty jin of grain. Usually, the more soil and the older the soil that the rat digs out from underground, the bigger the nest and the more grain it stores. When looking for rat holes, one should first find the main hole, which is the main entrance. The characteristic of the main entrance is that it is large and worn smooth. When digging a rat hole, one should dig deep along the entrance to find grain. Underground, the hole often branches into four or five openings and nests. Therefore, when one opening and nest does not yield grain, one should look for two more openings and nests, and one will surely find it. When digging rat holes, one must strictly prevent rats from escaping through other holes in order to eliminate them.

### 灭鼠三千多　缴粮万余斤  解放军某部打开“地下粮仓”

    灭鼠三千多　缴粮万余斤
    解放军某部打开“地下粮仓”
    本报讯　解放军某部全体官兵积极响应国家大力节约粮食的号召，结合消灭老鼠，解决二百口猪两个月的猪饲料问题。他们利用休息时间拿锹携筐，到驻地附近田野去挖老鼠洞，一面除鼠害，一面挖粮食。近半月来，他们已挖粮（玉米和大豆）一万六千五百四十九斤，打死老鼠三千二百余只。
    一天，李竹修等五人到豆地和玉米地里去挖老鼠洞里的粮食来做猪的饲料，挖了六个老鼠洞，就挖出黄豆一百一十斤。第二天他们又从五个老鼠洞中挖出一百零九斤粮食。“地下粮仓”发现后，很快在部队中传开了。在四、五天内，仅两个班就挖粮一千七百一十九斤。
    他们在挖鼠洞中发现，老鼠多散居在大豆和苞米地畔、田埂，地垅也有，不过较少。一般的大鼠洞，粮食多至三、四十斤。通常老鼠从地下向上倒出的土越多、越旧，窝就越大、储粮也越多。在寻找鼠洞时，应先找出主洞，也就是总洞。总洞的特点是：洞口大，磨的溜光。挖鼠洞时，应依洞口深挖找粮，洞地下又常分支四、五个洞口和窝不等，因此当一个洞口和窝找不到粮时，要多找两个洞口和窝，必然找到。在挖鼠洞时，要严防老鼠从别的洞眼逃遁，以便消灭。
