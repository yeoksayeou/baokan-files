　　Unfinished Task
　　Sun Kunxiang
　　At the end of last month, I went back to my hometown to visit relatives. Before leaving, my uncle gave me a task: to persuade an old woman (my uncle’s clan aunt) from his family to come and live with us. I readily agreed. At the time, I thought: an old, childless widow of nearly sixty, wouldn't she be overjoyed to come to the city for a leisurely life? What was there to persuade?

　　After returning home, I mentioned it to my mother, and she was also very happy, saying, "If Auntie stays in the village enjoying the 'Five Guarantees,' it will increase the burden on the commune; even though she isn't a close aunt, it’s right to show her some filial respect."

　　The next day after breakfast, I went to see Auntie. It had been more than four years since I had seen her last. I remembered that her gate faced south, and although there were seven or eight rooms in the courtyard, they were mostly collapsed or leaking. Only the two southern rooms where she lived were barely habitable. As I walked to the gate, wow! The walls were freshly plastered with lime, making me almost doubt I had the right gate.

　　A child of thirteen or fourteen ran out of the east room and asked me, "Comrade, who are you looking for?"

　　"I'm looking for the person who lives in the south room, she is my Auntie."

　　"She's at the busy season nursery!"

　　"It's already Minor Snow, how can there still be a busy season nursery?"

　　"Comrade, don't you know we're in the middle of a production upsurge? Wait, I'll go get her."

　　Soon, Auntie came home. She looked no older than she did four years ago, and although her cotton-padded coat had two patches, it was very clean. When she saw it was me, she smiled and quickly invited me into the house.

　　The bedding, table, and stools in the room were all neatly arranged. A picture of Chairman Mao hung on the wall, with two red paper strips on either side that read "Listen to Chairman Mao's words" and "Be diligent and thrifty in managing the household."

　　After some small talk, I turned to the main topic: "Auntie, the reason I came home this time is that my uncle asked me to come and take you back."

　　Unexpectedly, as soon as I said that, she said angrily, "Why are you asking me to go again! I can still do so much work at home, going there would make me useless." Then she told me that during the busy season, she looked after the fields, shelled corn, picked cotton, and took care of children in the busy season nursery. During the slack season, she collected manure and gathered firewood. She also kept eight hens. Last year, she earned over 800 work points, and this year she has already earned over 900. Aside from food and clothing, she has enough pocket money to spend. In recent years, the money my uncle sent home has all been used to rebuild the west rooms and repair the gate.

　　"You're getting on in years, and there's no one to take care of you in the mornings and evenings, it's better to go," I still wanted to persuade her.

　　"Don't think I'm almost sixty, I'm still very strong! I can still work in the fields for another ten or twenty years, why would I need someone to take care of me? How can you young people say such foolish things? Now it's a cooperative! The commune and the neighbors are so good to me! If I'm even slightly unwell, they all come to ask how I am, get water for me, and cook for me!"

　　I had nothing to say. To wrap things up, I could only say, "Well, whenever you feel like it, you can go and stay for a couple of days, take a look, and then come back."

　　Auntie, seeing that I wasn't saying anything more, became happy again, rolled up her sleeves, and started making noodles, insisting I stay for chicken and potato noodles.

　　While eating the noodles, she told me that this year the commune's production was lower than last year because of the heavy rainfall, so she had been mixing some pumpkin into her diet since the summer to save wheat. To save even more grain, she also dried more than ten catties of dried vegetables, and a few days ago, when the grain rations were distributed, she voluntarily took fifteen catties less.

　　After returning from my visit home, I made a "self-criticism" to my uncle for not completing the task. My uncle, of course, had no reason to blame me. He decided at the time to send home five yuan a month, as fulfilling our responsibility to support her. But we had no certainty as to whether Auntie would accept the money.

    没完成的任务
    孙堃祥
    上月底，回故乡探亲。临走时，舅父交给了一项任务：把家中的一个佬娘（舅父的本家婶子）动员来。我满口答应了。当时我想：一个快六十岁的绝户老妈妈，能到城市来清闲度日，不欢天喜地才怪呢，还动员什么。
    回家后，对母亲一说，她也很欢喜，说：“佬娘在家里享受五保，就要增加社里的负担；虽说不是亲婶侄，孝敬孝敬也是应该的。”
    第二天吃过早饭，我就去看佬娘。四年多没去看她了，记得，她的大门是在路南，院里虽有七、八间屋，可早就塌的塌，漏的漏了，只有她住着的两间南屋还免强能住。走到大门口，哟！墙全用石灰刷的崭新，简直使我怀疑认错了大门。
    从东屋里跑出一个十三、四岁的小孩，问我：“同志，你找谁？”
    “找住南屋里的，她是我的佬娘。”
    “她在农忙托儿所里啦。”
    “都小雪了，怎么还有农忙托儿所？”
    “同志，你不知道现在是生产高潮吗？等着，我去给你找。”
    一会儿，佬娘回家来了。她比四年前丝毫没见老，穿的棉衣上有两个补绽，但满干净。她一见是我，赶紧笑嘻嘻把我让到屋里。
    屋里的床被、桌橙都摆设得非常整齐，墙上挂着一张毛主席画，两边还贴着两张写着“听毛主席的话”、“劳动勤俭持家”的红纸条。
    闲扯了几句，我就转向正题：“佬娘，我这次来家，是我舅叫我来接您。”
    不料，刚一说，她就气呼呼地说：“怎么又叫我去！在家里我还能干好多活，到那里就成废人了。”接着又告诉我：农忙时，她看场、剥玉米、拾棉花和在农忙托儿所里看小孩，农闲时就拾粪、搂柴草，家里还养着八个母鸡，去年光工分就赚了八百多，今年已经九百挂零了。自己除了吃、穿，还有足够的零钱花。几年来，舅父捎家的钱，都用到翻盖西屋和修整大门上了。
    “您这么大年纪，早晨晚上家里没人伺候，还是走好。”我还想劝她。
    “你别看我快六十了，身体可壮着啦！坡里的活也还能再干一、二十年，要人伺候干吗？你这年青人怎么也说这些糊涂话。现在是合作社啦！社里、街坊家对我可好啦，稍有点不舒坦，就都来问长问短，给打水啊！做饭啊！”
    我没有什么话好说了，为了收场，只好说：“那么，你啥时高兴就去住两天，看看再回来吧。”
    佬娘见我不再说了，才又高兴起来，挽起袖子合开面，留我吃鸡子烂锅面。
    吃面条的时候，她又告诉我：今年因为雨水大社里比去年减了产，她从夏天就掺和着吃了些南瓜，所以省下点麦子；为了节省粮食，她又晒下十多斤干菜，前几天分口粮时，自动少要了十五斤。
    探家回来后，向舅父做了没完成任务的“检讨”。舅父当然没有理由责备我，当时决定，今后每月寄家五元钱，算尽抚养的责任。可是佬娘到底会不会收这笔钱，我们都没有把握。
