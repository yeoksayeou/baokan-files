"Principled" Agreements Cannot Conceal Disagreements
By our reporter Pan Fei

The Paris conference concluded with the achievement of a "principled" agreement. The so-called "principled" agreement means that the United States' original plan to arm Western Europe with intermediate-range missiles has not been fulfilled, or at least has been greatly delayed. It also means that the contradictions and disagreements within the North Atlantic Group have not been resolved.

The peaceful proposals put forward in Bulganin's letter have received the support of peace-loving countries and people all over the world. Taking Britain as an example, according to a recent Gallup poll, 85% of Britons favor negotiations with the Soviet Union, and 56% favor not arming East and West Germany with nuclear weapons. This has created tremendous public pressure, forcing the agenda of the Paris conference to be temporarily changed, and the Soviet peace proposals to be listed as one of the issues to be formally discussed.

The Paris conference affirmed that intermediate-range missiles would become the weapons of the North Atlantic Group, but on the issue of establishing missile launch sites, the fourteen member states other than the United States were divided into three types of countries: Britain, the Netherlands, and Turkey risked providing the United States with bases for nuclear war; Norway and Denmark directly rejected the US request; and the vast majority of Western European countries, including France and West Germany, either dared not rashly undertake obligations due to strong domestic public pressure, or attempted to use this to bargain with the United States, and adopted a reserved attitude.

This situation made Britain's original action of wanting to play the role of "model partner" on this issue a great irony for Britain. The British "Daily Telegraph" could only comfort itself with this reason, saying: "The American 'Thor' and 'Jupiter' intermediate-range missiles will not be supplied to Britain until the end of next year, and to other countries of the North Atlantic Group until the year after next. Therefore, these countries believe that there is time to further consider their policies."

The final communiqué of the Paris conference talked about political issues in considerable length, which also indicated the failure of US policy. The United States had to admit that there was a need to "improve" and "strengthen" political consultations among the member states of the North Atlantic Group; and that this military group could not limit its interests to military aspects alone. The communiqué devoted an entire paragraph to the issue of disarmament. Although the Paris conference still repeated the Western countries' clichés on the issue of disarmament, even Dulles had to agree that there was a need for further contact with the Soviet Union.

The Paris conference did not resolve the disputes and conflicts within the North Atlantic Group. On issues such as Algeria, Cyprus, the withdrawal of British troops stationed in West Germany, and the cost of maintaining these troops, the disagreements were as great as before. In the communiqué, they were merely concealed by a "principled" agreement.

Eisenhower and Dulles failed to impose the intentions of the United States on its Western European partners. Of course, this does not mean that the harm of the US aggressive policy to world peace can be underestimated. The United States is trying to use the smokescreen of "peaceful contact with the Soviet Union" to calm world public opinion, and is attempting to "implement" the "principles" of the Paris conference at the North Atlantic Group meeting next spring. But the decisive fact is that the balance of power between the two camps has undergone a fundamental change. This not only encourages the Western European people's will to defend peace, but also makes the ruling groups of these countries have to make a calm re-evaluation of the current situation. This is why the Paris conference cannot bring stability to the North Atlantic Group.

### “原则性”的协议掩盖不了分歧

    “原则性”的协议掩盖不了分歧
    本报记者  潘非
    巴黎会议以达成“原则性”的协议而结束。所谓“原则性”的协议，意味着美国以中程导弹武装西欧的原定计划没有如愿以偿，至少，是被大大地推迟了。它也意味着北大西洋集团内部的矛盾和分歧没有得到解决。
    布尔加宁信中所提出的和平倡议，得到了全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的支持。拿英国来说，根据盖洛普最近的民意测验，英国人中赞成同苏联进行谈判的达85％；赞成不以核武器武装东、西德的占56％。这就形成了巨大的舆论压力。使得巴黎会议的议程不得不临时作了更改，把苏联的和平建议列为要正式讨论的问题之一。
    巴黎会议肯定了中程导弹将成为北大西洋集团的武器，但是在设立导弹发射场的问题上，除美国以外的十四个成员国，分裂为三种类型的国家：英国、荷兰和土耳其甘冒危险，为美国提供进行核子战争的基地；挪威和丹麦，直截了当地拒绝了美国的要求；而绝大部分的西欧国家，包括法国和西德在内，它们或者慑于国内公众强大的压力，不敢贸然承担义务，或者企图借此同美国进行讨价还价，都采取了保留的态度。
    这种情况，使得英国原来想在这问题上起“模范伙伴”作用的行动变成了对英国的一大讽刺。英国的“每日电讯报”只能以这样的理由来聊以解嘲，它说：“美国的‘雷神’和‘丘辟特’式中程导弹，直到明年年底才能供给英国，后年才能供给北大西洋集团其他国家。因此，这些国家都认为有进一步考虑它的政策的时间。”
    巴黎会议的最后公报以相当多的篇幅谈到政治问题，这也表示了美国政策的失败。美国不得不承认：在北大西洋集团的成员国间，有必要“改善”和“加强”政治协商；以及这个军事集团不能只把它的兴趣局限于军事方面。公报以整整一段提到裁军问题。尽管巴黎会议仍然重复西方国家在裁军问题上的陈词滥调，但是即使是杜勒斯，也不得不同意有必要同苏联作进一步的接触。
    巴黎会议没有解决北大西洋集团内部的争执和纠纷，在阿尔及利亚、塞浦路斯、英国撤退驻扎在西德的军队以及维持这支军队的费用等问题上，分歧同原来一样大。在公报里不过是用“原则性”的协议把它们掩盖起来罢了。
    艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯没有能够把美国的意图，强加在它的西欧伙伴的身上。当然，这并不意味着可以低估美国侵略政策对世界和平的危害性。美国正企图用“同苏联进行和平接触”这一烟幕来平息世界舆论，并且企图在明年春天的北大西洋集团会议上“贯彻”巴黎会议的“原则”。但是具有决定意义的事实是：两个阵营的力量对比已经起了根本的变化。这不仅鼓舞了西欧人民保卫和平的意志，并且使得这些国家的统治集团，也不能不对当前的局势重新作冷静的估计。巴黎会议不能为北大西洋集团带来稳定，原因就在于此。
