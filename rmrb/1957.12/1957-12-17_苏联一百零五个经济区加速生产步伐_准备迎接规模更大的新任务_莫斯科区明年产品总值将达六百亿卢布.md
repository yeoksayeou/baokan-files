Moscow Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 16th – The National Economic Committees of the Soviet Union’s 105 economic zones are leading their subordinate industrial enterprises to complete the 1957 production plan ahead of schedule and to prepare for the even larger 1958 production plan. The 430 industrial enterprises managed by the Moscow (City) National Economic Committee will produce approximately 60 billion rubles worth of products in 1958, including over 400 types of new products and over 180 types of new machines. Due to enterprise specialization, the adoption of new technologies, the improvement of labor organization, and the enhanced skills of cadres, labor productivity will further increase next year. Moscow is a machine manufacturing center. Over 30% of the Soviet Union's automobiles, 30% of its ball bearings, and 37% of its powerful transformers are produced in Moscow. Next year, many modern machines will be manufactured, such as a giant high-speed electronic computer capable of performing 20,000 calculations per second, complex automatic continuous production equipment, new sedans, trucks, watches, televisions, and so on. Next year, machine manufacturing plants will widely adopt precision castings and modified cast iron. In electrical equipment, radio equipment, and watch factories, highly durable alloy cutting tools and dies will be widely used, capable of continuously producing 500,000 parts without needing to be reground. Many textile mills will switch to producing wide fabrics. With just this one improvement, Moscow can increase the annual production of cotton cloth by 2.4 million square meters, woolen fabrics by 500,000 square meters, and silk fabrics by 2.3 million square meters. The specialization of factories in the Moscow (City) economic zone will develop in two directions: first, the specialization of backup production and auxiliary production, organizing large-scale mechanized facilities such as casting, forging, tool, and other workshops and sections; second, individual factories will reduce the variety of products and hand over what they are not good at producing to specialized enterprises.

    苏联一百零五个经济区加速生产步伐
    准备迎接规模更大的新任务
    莫斯科区明年产品总值将达六百亿卢布
    本报莫斯科16日电　苏联一百零五个经济区的国民经济委员会，都在领导所属工业企业提前完成1957年生产计划和迎接规模更大的1958年生产计划。莫斯科（市）国民经济委员会所管理的四百三十个工业企业在1958年将出产总值约六百亿卢布的产品，将出产四百多种新式产品和一百八十多种新式机器，由于企业的专业化，新技术的采用，劳动组织的改善，干部水平的提高，明年劳动生产率将进一步增长。莫斯科是机器制造业中心，苏联30％以上的汽车、30％的滚珠轴承、37％的强大变压器是在莫斯科市生产的。明年将制造许多现代化机器，如每秒钟能够演算二万次的巨型高速电子计算机，复杂的自动连续生产装置，新式轿车、卡车、手表、电视机等等。明年机器制造厂将广泛采用精密铸件和变性铸铁，在电气器材、无线电器材和钟表工厂将广泛采用高度坚韧的合金的切削工具和压模，它们能够连续生产五十万零件而不必重磨。许多纺织厂的织布机将改产宽幅布匹。仅仅这一项改进，莫斯科一年就可以增产棉布二百四十万平方公尺、毛呢五十万平方公尺、丝绸二百三十万平方公尺。莫斯科（市）经济区的工厂的专业化将向两个方面发展：其一，后备生产和补助生产的专业化，组织大型的机械化的场所，如铸造、锻压、工具及其他车间和工段。其二，个别工厂将减少产品的品种，而把它们不善于生产的东西交给专门的企业去生产。
