Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The First Cooperative of Daxing in Changsha County, Hunan Province, has moved from being disorganized to consolidated through the rectification campaign, and has also set off a production upsurge.

The First Cooperative of Daxing has 148 households. Since this year, the illegal landlords and rich peasants in the cooperative have been quite active. Some well-to-do middle peasants also frequently exaggerate some shortcomings in their work, refusing to invest domestic fertilizer or work, preparing to withdraw from the cooperative and work independently after the autumn harvest. Under their influence, some members also lost confidence in running the cooperative. Less than 50% of the cooperative's labor force regularly went to work. At the beginning of the rectification campaign, the cooperative's Party branch adopted the methods of "big contending, big blooming, and big debate," while simultaneously strengthening specific leadership over production, specifically arranging autumn and winter production and members' household side occupations to the teams and households. They also established labor discipline and covenants through the masses. In this way, the rectification campaign and production advanced simultaneously, resulting in an unprecedented production upsurge since the establishment of the cooperative.

The characteristic of the rectification campaign in this cooperative is to boldly mobilize the masses, thoroughly unleash criticism, and rectify while criticizing. Before the unleashing of criticism, the purpose and significance of the rectification campaign were first fully discussed among the Party and Communist Youth League members to remove concerns. Then, extensive publicity was carried out among the masses to welcome criticism and suggestions. In the first few days, the members put forward 630 suggestions. The Party branch and cooperative committee immediately grasped these opinions and modified what they could immediately. In this way, more and more opinions were expressed, and the more thorough they became. When the cooperative cadres saw that the opinions raised were sharp, but most of them hoped to run the cooperative well, and many were problems that they had never thought of, they were greatly shocked, and thus more boldly and freely mobilized criticism. Cooperative Committee member Su Chengwu was very moved when he saw that the members both criticized his shortcomings and affirmed his good skills, and wanted him to actively lead the overall production of the cooperative. So he took the initiative to go to various teams to solicit opinions, and immediately worked with everyone to survey and formulate a water conservancy plan, which enabled this year's winter repair to start half a month earlier. A total of more than 2,000 suggestions were put forward by the whole cooperative, most of which were correct. The Party branch and cooperative committee have classified and ranked these opinions and are vigorously carrying out rectification and reform. This cooperative has combined the rectification campaign with Party and Communist Youth League consolidation.

The cooperative also mobilized the masses to focus on criticizing several well-to-do middle peasant households with serious capitalist ideas and behaviors, which greatly educated the masses.

    能改马上改　越放越彻底
    大兴一社从涣散走向巩固
    新华社专讯　湖南省长沙县大兴一社，通过整风已由涣散走向巩固，并掀起了生产高潮。
    大兴一社有一百四十八户。今年以来，社里的不法地主和富农等相当活跃，部分富裕中农也经常夸大工作中的一些缺点，不把家肥投资也不出工，准备秋后退社单干。在他们影响下，部分社员也对办社丧失信心。全社劳力经常出工的不到50％。整风一开始，这个社党支部便采取大鸣、大放、大争的方法，同时加强对生产的具体领导，把秋冬生产和社员家庭副业都具体安排到队到户，并通过群众订出劳动纪律和公约，这样整风生产齐头并进，出现了建社以来未有的生产高潮。
    这个社整风的特点，是大胆发动群众，彻底鸣放，边放边改。鸣放前，首先在党、团员骨干中充分讨论整风的目的和意义，解除顾虑，然后就在群众中大力宣传欢迎批评和提意见。开始几天社员放出六百三十条意见，党支部和社委会就抓紧研究这些意见，能改的马上就改，这样，大家的意见就越放越多，越放越彻底。社干看到提出的意见虽然尖锐，但大多数是希望把社办好，有很多是从来没想到的问题，震动很大，于是就更加大胆放手发动鸣放。社委粟成武看到社员既批评他的缺点，又肯定他的技术好，要他积极把全社生产领导起来，很受感动，便主动去各队征求意见，立即和大家一道勘察订出了水利计划，使今年冬修提早一个半月开工。全社一共提了两千多条意见，大多数是正确的。党支部和社委会已将这些意见分类排队大力进行整改。这个社结合整风进行了整党整团。
    这个社还发动群众有重点地批判几户具有严重资本主义思想和行为的富裕中农，这对群众教育很大。
