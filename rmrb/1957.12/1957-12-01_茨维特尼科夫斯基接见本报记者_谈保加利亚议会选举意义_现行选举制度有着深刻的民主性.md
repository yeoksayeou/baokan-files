　　Tsvetanov Meets with Our Newspaper Reporter
　　Discusses Significance of Bulgarian Parliamentary Elections
　　Current Election System Possesses Profound Democracy
    Sofia Dispatch from our newspaper, November 30th. On the eve of the third Bulgarian National Assembly elections, the Chairman of the Bulgarian National Election Committee and President of the Supreme Court, Ni. Tsvetanov, met with reporters and answered their questions.
    The Bulgarian National Assembly elections are scheduled to be held regularly on December 22nd. At present, the nomination of parliamentary candidates and voter registration have been completed. Two hundred and fifty-four parliamentary candidates are meeting with voters across the country.
    Tsvetanov first spoke about the profound democracy of the Bulgarian electoral system. He said that all Bulgarian citizens who are eighteen years of age or older, regardless of nationality, race, gender, religious belief, education level, place of residence, social origin, or property status, have the right to vote and be elected. Voters have the broadest rights in nominating candidates for parliamentary representatives. Not only do the central organs of political, social and cultural organizations of the working people have the right to propose candidates, but also the general meetings of workers and staff members of enterprises and institutions, agricultural cooperatives, state farms and rural peasants, as well as the general meetings of officers and soldiers of the armed forces have this right. A prominent manifestation of the democratic nature of the Bulgarian electoral system is that the election of parliamentary representatives is not prepared and conducted by state and police organs as in capitalist countries, but directly by the voters through the electoral committees at all levels elected by them.
    Tsvetanov then spoke about the significance of this election. He pointed out: The significance of this election is significant. The spiritual and political unity of the people of the whole country, as demonstrated in the process of preparing for the election, will bring new sources of strength for the victorious construction of socialism in Bulgaria. The countless meetings between parliamentary representative candidates and voters will further enhance the contact between the highest organ of the people's power, the National Assembly, and the broad masses, and further raise the political and ideological level of the masses. He emphasized that there is no doubt that this election will demonstrate the increasingly solid spiritual and political unity of the Bulgarian people under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party and under the banner of the Fatherland Front, and the unified will of the Bulgarian people to advance along the road of building socialism and safeguarding world peace in the fraternal unity of the Soviet Union and all People's Democratic countries.

　  茨维特尼科夫斯基接见本报记者
　　谈保加利亚议会选举意义
　  现行选举制度有着深刻的民主性
    本报索非亚30日电　在保加利亚第三届国民议会选举前夕，保加利亚全国选举委员会主席、最高法院院长尼·茨维特尼科夫斯基接见了记者并回答了记者的问题。
    保加利亚国民议会选举定期在12月22日举行。目前，议员候选人的提名和选民登记工作已经结束。二百五十四名议员候选人正在各地同选民会面。
    茨维特尼科夫斯基首先谈到了保加利亚选举制度的深刻的民主性。他说，凡年满十八岁的保加利亚公民不分民族、种族、性别、宗教信仰、教育程度、居住地区、社会出身和财产状况都有选举权和被选举权。在议会代表候选人提名方面选民有最广泛的权利。不仅劳动人民的政治、社会和文化组织的中央机构有权提出候选人，企业和机关的职工全体会议，农业社、国营农场和农村的农民以及部队的官兵全体会议都有这一权利。保加利亚选举制度民主性的一个鲜明表现是：议会代表选举不是像资本主义国家那样由国家和警察机构准备和进行的，而是直接由选民通过他们选出的各级选举委员会准备和进行的。
    茨维特尼科夫斯基接着谈到了这次选举的意义。他指出：这次选举的意义是重大的。在准备选举过程中所表现的全国人民精神上、政治上的团结一致，将为在保加利亚胜利地建设社会主义带来新的力量源泉。议会代表候选人同选民的无数次的会见，将更加密切人民政权最高机构——国民议会同广大群众的接触，更加提高群众的政治思想水平。他强调指出，毫无疑问，这次选举将显示保加利亚人民在保加利亚共产党领导下和祖国阵线旗帜下日益牢固的精神上、政治上的团结一致和保加利亚人民在苏联和所有人民民主国家兄弟般的团结下，沿着建设社会主义和维护世界和平道路前进的统一意志。
