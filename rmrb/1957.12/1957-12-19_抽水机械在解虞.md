Pumping Machinery in Jieyu
Hui Wen
It is necessary and beneficial to use hydraulic machinery, but problems will arise if preparations are inadequate.
Jieyu County in the Jinan Special Zone of Shanxi Province is located on the northern foothills of the Zhongtiao Mountains and is a region rich in cotton and wheat. The land is flat and water resources are abundant. According to a preliminary survey, about 600,000 mu of the county's 750,000 mu of arable land can gradually be turned into irrigated land; however, most of it requires the use of groundwater, making it suitable for developing water lifting irrigation. In 1956, the county planned to increase the irrigated area by 200,000 mu. If human and animal-powered water lifting tools were developed, the county would have to install more than 10,000 animal-powered waterwheels, increasing the number of livestock by nearly 20,000. At the time, it seemed fundamentally impossible to increase the livestock so much. On the other hand, the groundwater level in the county is generally high, the water source is abundant in most areas, the masses have strong investment capacity, and there are good conditions for developing mechanical water lifting irrigation. Thus, developing mechanical irrigation to ensure increased grain and cotton production became the urgent demand of the vast number of agricultural cooperative members in the county; at the same time, after the advanced agricultural cooperatives were established, they also had the conditions to develop pumping machinery on a large scale. The Jieyu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party analyzed this situation and believed that developing power-driven pumping machinery could increase agricultural production, solve the problem of insufficient labor and livestock power in economic crop areas, and overcome the difficulties brought about by the lack of livestock power after increasing the number of wells. Therefore, it was decided to promote pumping machinery on a large scale throughout the county.

In the past year, the county developed 404 diesel engines and locomotive boilers, totaling 2,383 horsepower; now the county has a total of 445 power-driven pumping machines of various types, totaling 2,575 horsepower, including the original machines. Due to the large-scale development of power-driven pumping machinery, the irrigated area has been expanded by more than 80,000 mu, which has played a significant role in increasing cotton and wheat production this year.

However, after the large-scale development of pumping machinery, many problems and many unexpected difficulties also occurred. First of all, agricultural cooperatives had few drivers and low technical skills, so they could not manage the machines well, and there was no set of management, maintenance, and repair systems. In addition, there was no machine room, and the machines were placed randomly, exposed to wind and rain. As a result, the machines often malfunctioned. Last year, only about half of the pumping machinery in the county was used regularly. When the machinery broke down or lacked parts, it could not be repaired in time. People often ran around, seeking help everywhere, and some even went to Taiyuan and Xi'an for repairs and parts. This not only increased repair costs but also delayed timely irrigation of crops. The Qinghua Red Star Cooperative sent four machines to Taiyuan and Xi'an for repairs after they broke down. Because the problems were relatively large, the repair costs alone cost nearly 4,000 yuan, equivalent to 50% of the machine cost. At the same time, because the factory had not included it in the quarterly production plan in advance, it took nearly half a year to repair them. The utilization rate of the machines in the county was also not high. In addition to being used for irrigation, the rest of the time they were idle for a long time and could not play a role.

The emergence of the above problems once frustrated the enthusiasm of some agricultural cooperatives for developing mechanical irrigation. Some agricultural cooperatives went from wanting machines and vying to buy machines when they didn't have them to worrying about machines when they had them; some cooperatives even asked to return the machines because the operating techniques were difficult to master.

After the county party committee discovered this situation, they believed that the problem was serious. If it was not effectively resolved, it would inevitably affect the continued development of water conservancy and the further close relationship between workers and peasants. Over the past year, they have gone through a tortuous road and finally found a solution to these problems.

Cultivate Drivers, Expand the Technical Team, Strengthen Management and Maintenance, and Establish Repair and Parts Organizations
First, adopt various methods to train and improve drivers and expand the technical team. In 1955, there were only more than 40 people in the county who knew how to operate diesel engines. Such a weak technical force could not meet the needs of large-scale development of power-driven pumping machinery. In order to effectively solve this problem, in addition to the province and special zone continuing to train 84 various drivers, they also adopted three methods to train personnel: training, master-apprentice teaching, and contracted rotational guidance. Training courses were held in seven phases, training 947 people. In the training, they encountered the difficulty of lacking suitable teaching materials, so they compiled popular teaching materials based on the training materials of the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau. When there were not enough teachers, they were responsible for training on the one hand by the existing more skilled old technicians of supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives, and on the other hand, they hired technicians from Tianjin Internal Combustion Engine Manufacturing Factory and Shijiazhuang Power Machine Manufacturing Factory to serve as teachers. More than 70% of the trainees who have undergone training can initially master the operating techniques. However, drivers who have undergone short-term training lack practical experience and have a low technical level. They further improved and cultivated technical forces by adopting the method of teaching while driving and master-apprentice teaching in actual work. A total of 666 apprentices were trained in the county, of which 574 were able to master the operating techniques well. For example, the Xingfu Cooperative in Yuyang Town, the county only trained 24 drivers for them, and they brought out 33 apprentices in actual work. Now the cooperative has a total of 57 technicians, with an average of two technicians mastering each machine. They also organized ten mechanical technicians from the county and township supply and marketing cooperatives to contract packages by region, guiding in rotation and helping to solve specific difficulties in operation. At the same time, they formulated safety operating procedures, promoted four experiences in mechanical management, saving fuel consumption, comprehensive utilization of machinery, and diesel engine modification to gas engine, and organized visits to exchange experiences. Through the above methods, the difficulties in operating techniques have been basically overcome.

The second is to strengthen management and maintenance and establish a simple repair and parts group.

Each agricultural cooperative has implemented a management system in which each person is responsible for a specific machine, and people follow the machine. Each machine has fixed workers who are fully responsible for everything from operation, oil use, irrigation to maintenance, and they are fixed all year round. Each agricultural cooperative has also formulated and implemented a inspection and maintenance system. In addition to inspecting and wiping at any time, many cooperatives do disassembly and scrubbing once every ten days to half a month, and a major disassembly and cleaning once a month. Some cooperatives also soften the water used by the locomotive boiler. Each agricultural cooperative also implements quota management, and strives to reduce fuel consumption and reduce costs. In this way, the chaos in management has been eliminated, the damage to machinery has been greatly reduced, and many advanced deeds such as reducing fuel consumption have emerged.

They also established repair and parts groups with one or several cooperatives as a unit, responsible for solving general repair and parts problems. There are a total of nine decent repair and parts groups established by agricultural cooperatives in the county. According to their experience, as long as there is an old technician, an investment of 1,500 to 2,000 yuan, and the purchase of tools such as pliers, wrenches, and cylinder boring machines, general problems can be repaired, and small screws, yuan rods, and other parts can be manufactured. The repair cost is also very low. Since its establishment eight months ago, the repair group of Xingfu Cooperative in Yuxiang Township has repaired more than 50 major and minor problems and distributed more than 50 large and small parts, saving more than 1,100 yuan compared with repairs outside. The members said: With the repair group, major problems are prevented, and minor problems are repaired by ourselves, which saves money and trouble.

If the machine has a major problem, it will be repaired by the supply and marketing cooperative and the ginnery. In the past six months, the county has repaired a total of 172 large and small machines and supplied more than 120 parts, basically ensuring the normal use of the machines.

In order to encourage the enthusiasm of drivers, each cooperative, based on the principle of "appropriately higher than general farm work", adopted the method of "gradually improving technology and gradually increasing work points", appropriately assessed the level according to the driver's technical level, gave reasonable remuneration separately, and at the same time paid attention to solving the welfare problems of the drivers. In addition, driving registration books, material cost accounting registration books, accident registration books, and merit and demerit registration books have been established for timely evaluation, rewards and punishments.

Use Power Machinery for Sideline Processing to Save Labor and Livestock Power and Increase Member Income
In order to give full play to the efficiency of machinery, they also use power machinery for sideline processing. The county mainly uses water pumps to irrigate cotton and wheat. However, the water demand and irrigation season of these two crops are only four to five months throughout the year, and the machines are idle for more than half a year. Due to the relationship between water sources, even during the irrigation period, it is difficult for high-horsepower machinery to exert all its effectiveness. On the other hand, farmers use a lot of labor and livestock power for sideline processing such as grinding flour, squeezing oil, and ginning cotton every year, which causes the tension of labor and livestock power. Moreover, these sideline processing are mostly concentrated in the winter and spring, which are not busy irrigation seasons. Therefore, it is necessary and possible to use machinery for sideline processing. According to incomplete statistics, there are a total of 234 machines with 1,271 horsepower in the county that are used for irrigation combined with sideline processing. The 85 machines used for ginning alone processed 55 million catties of lint cotton, accounting for more than 50% of the county's total output. The Liaoyuan Cooperative has a 58-horsepower diesel engine. In addition to driving an eight-inch water pump, it also uses the remaining 30 horsepower to simultaneously drive 18 ginning machines and four steel mills. Last winter and this spring, in addition to irrigating 222 mu, it also ginned 1.25 million catties of cotton and ground 5,000 catties of flour every day. Due to the comprehensive utilization of machinery, Liaoyuan Cooperative has increased its income by more than 53,000 yuan this year, and can net an income of more than 35,700 yuan after deducting the cost of mechanical construction. Because the use of machinery replaces human and animal power for sideline processing, a lot of labor has been freed up, which has a great effect on alleviating the tension of insufficient labor and animal power in economic crop areas. According to incomplete statistics, the county can save 120,000 working days of labor and more than 500,000 days of livestock power to invest in agricultural production. All of these have consolidated and encouraged the enthusiasm of agricultural cooperative members to develop pumping machinery. (Attached picture)

　　抽水机械在解虞

　　使用水利机械有必要有好处  准备工作不到家却会出毛病
    山西省晋南专区的解虞县位于中条山北麓，是一个盛产棉麦的地区。土地平坦，水利资源丰富。据初步普查，全县七十五万亩耕地中约有六十万亩可以逐步变成水浇地；但是大部分需要利用地下水，适合发展提水灌溉。1956年这个县计划增加灌溉面积二十万亩，如果发展用人力和畜力的提水工具，全县就得安装畜力水车一万多部，增加牲口将近两万头。当时看来，增加这么多的牲口是根本不可能的。从另一方面看，全县地下水位一般都很高，多数地区水源很旺，群众投资能力强，有着很好的发展机械提水灌溉的条件。这样，发展机械灌溉，保证粮棉增产，就成为全县广大农业社社员的迫切要求；同时，农业高级合作化以后，也具备了大量发展抽水机械的条件。中共解虞县委分析了这一情况，认为发展动力抽水机械，能够提高农业产量，解决经济作物区劳畜力不足的问题，克服增加水井以后带来的畜力不足的困难，因此决定在全县范围内大量推广抽水机械。
    去年一年，全县便发展了柴油机和锅驼机四百零四部，共二千三百八十三马力；现在全县连原有的机械，共有各种动力抽水机械四百四十五部，共二千五百七十五马力。由于动力抽水机械大量发展，水浇地扩大了八万多亩，对今年的棉麦增产起了不小的作用。
    但是在抽水机械大发展以后，也发生了不少问题和许多意想不到的困难。首先是农业社的司机人员少，技术低，不能很好地管理机器，也没有一套管理和保养检修的制度，加上没有机房，机器随便乱放，听任风吹雨淋，结果机器经常发生毛病。去年全县经常使用的抽水机械只有半数上下。机械出了毛病和缺了零件以后，又不能及时修理，往往是东奔西走，到处求人，有的还跑到太原和西安去修理和配零件。这样不但加大了修理成本，也耽误了作物的及时灌溉。清华红星社有四部机器发生毛病以后送到太原和西安去修理，因为毛病较大，光修理费就花了将近四千元，相当于机器成本的50％。同时由于工厂事先没有纳入季度生产计划，费了将近半年的时间才修理回来。全县的机器利用率也不高，除用于浇地以外，其余的时间便长期闲着不能发挥作用。
    上述问题的出现，曾经挫折了部分农业社发展机械灌溉的积极性。有的农业社由原来没机器想机器，争着买机器一变而为有了机器愁机器；甚至有个别社因为操作技术难掌握竟要求退机器。
    县委发现这种情况以后，认为问题是严重的，如不有效地加以解决，势必要影响到水利的继续发展和工农关系的进一步密切。一年来，他们走过了一段曲曲折折的道路终于找到了解决这些问题的办法。
　　培养司机人员扩大技术队伍  加强管理养护建立修配组织
    首先是采用多种多样的办法培养和提高司机手，扩大技术队伍。1955年的时候，全县会开柴油机的只有四十多个人，这样一支薄弱的技术力量是不能适应大量发展动力抽水机械的需要的。为了切实解决这一问题，除省、专区继续给他们培训了各种司机手八十四人以外，他们还采取训练、师傅带徒弟和包干轮回指导等三种办法来培训人员。训练班先后举办了七期，训练了九百四十七人。在训练中碰到了缺少合适的教材的困难，他们便根据省水利局的训练教材，编写了通俗的教材。教员不足，他们便一方面由供销社和农业社现有的比较熟练的老技工负责训练，另一方面向天津内燃机制造厂、石家庄动力机器制造厂聘请技工担任教师。经过训练的学员70％以上都能初步掌握操作技术。但是经过短期训练的司机手，缺乏实际经验，技术水平还很低。他们便在实际工作中采取边开边教、师傅带徒弟的办法进一步提高和培养技术力量。全县共带出徒弟六百六十六人，其中有五百七十四人能够较好地掌握操作技术。例如虞仰镇幸福社，县上只给他们训练了二十四名司机手，他们在实际工作中带出了三十三名。现在全社共有五十七名技工，每部机械平均有两个技工掌握。他们还组织县和集镇供销社的十名机械技术员分片包干，轮回指导，帮助解决操作中的具体困难。同时，制定了安全操作规程，推广了机械管理、节省耗油量、机械综合利用、柴油机改装煤气机四种经验，并且组织参观交流经验。通过上面几种办法，基本上克服了操作技术上的困难。
    其次是加强管理养护，建立简易的修配组。
    各农业社都实行了专人专机、人跟机器走的管理制度。每部机器都固定工人，从操作、用油、浇地到保养全盘包给他们，而且常年固定。各农业社还制订和贯彻了检修保养制度。除随时检修擦洗以外，许多社作到了每十天至半月拆卸擦洗一次，每月大拆洗一次。有的社锅驼机用的水还经过软化处理。各农业社还实行定额管理，努力减少燃料消耗，降低成本。这样一来，管理上的混乱现象便消除了，机械损坏情况大为减少，并且出现了许多减少燃料消耗等的先进事迹。
    他们还以一个社或几个社为单位成立修配小组，负责解决了一般的修配问题。全县农业社自己建立的像样的修配小组共九个。根据他们的经验，只要有一个老技术工人、投资一千五百至二千元，购买些钳子、扳子、搪缸机等工具，就可以修理一般的毛病，并且能制造小螺丝、元杆等零件。修理成本也很低。象于乡幸福社的修配小组成立八个月以来，共修过大小毛病五十多次，配大小零件五十多件，比到外面修理节省开支一千一百多元。社员们说：有了修理小组，大毛病防止了，小毛病自己就修了，既省钱又省事。
    如果机器出了较大的毛病，就由供销社和轧花厂修配。半年来，全县共修好大小机器一百七十二部，供应零件一百二十多件，基本上保证了机器的正常使用。
    为了鼓励司机的积极性，各社都本着“适当高于一般农活”的原则，采取“逐步提高技术，逐步增加工分”的办法，按司机各人技术高低适当评定等级，分别给以合理报酬，同时注意解决司机手的福利问题。此外，还建立了开车登记簿、领物成本核算登记簿、事故发生登记簿和功过登记簿等，以便按时评比，进行奖惩。
　　利用动力机械进行副业加工  节省人力畜力增加社员收入
    为了充分发挥机械效能，他们还把动力机械用于副业加工。这个县使用抽水机主要是浇灌棉花和小麦。但是这两种作物的需水和灌溉季节，全年也不过四至五个月，有半年以上的时间机器闲着不用。大马力机械由于水源关系，即使在灌溉期内，也很难发挥所有的效用。另一方面，农民每年用于磨面、榨油、轧花等副业加工方面的劳畜力很多，造成了劳畜力的紧张，而且这些副业加工又多集中在冬春这两个灌溉不忙的季节里，这就有必要而且有可能用机械来进行副业加工。据不完全的统计，全县用来浇地结合副业加工的机械共有二百三十四部，一千二百七十一马力。仅用于轧花的八十五部机器就加工出皮棉五千五百万斤，占全县总产量的50％以上。燎原社一个五十八马力的柴油机，除带动一台八寸水泵以外，还利用剩余的三十多个马力同时带动十八部轧花车和四个钢磨，去冬今春除浇地二百二十二亩外，还轧花一百二十五万斤，每天磨面五千斤。燎原社由于综合利用机械，今年来共增加收入五万三千多元，除去机械建设成本还可以净收入三万五千七百多元。由于使用机械代替人力、畜力进行副业加工，因而腾出了不少的劳动力，对缓和经济作物区劳畜力不足的紧张局势有很大作用。据不完全统计，全县可以节省出劳力十二万个工日、畜力五十多万日投入农业生产。这些都巩固和鼓舞了农业社员发展抽水机械的积极性。（附图片）
