After entering the third stage of the rectification campaign, most units have successively experienced a climax of airing views freely. After the climax of airing views emerges, the masses should be rapidly mobilized to launch a rectification upsurge.

Airing views freely is for the sake of major rectification and major changes. Airing views only raises problems, while rectification is what solves problems. After a raging fire has already been ignited, it must be allowed to quickly burn away all the bad things on our bodies. Some comrades do not oppose vigorously carrying out rectification in the third stage of the rectification campaign, but they have different views on whether to immediately launch a rectification upsurge after the climax of airing views. They feel that although a climax of airing views has already formed, generally speaking, the depth of airing views is not yet sufficient, with many general problems being exposed and fewer major problems; therefore, we should wait until the airing of views is deeper and more thorough, and major problems are exposed more fully and clearly, before concentrating our efforts on rectification, so as to quickly solve major problems in our work. This idea is inconsistent with the demands of the masses and the needs of the work. At present, the eyes of the masses are watching the actions of the leaders, judging from their attitude towards these problems how much determination the leaders have to carry out rectification. If the leaders vigorously carry out rectification, using action to prove their determination, the enthusiasm of the masses will be further encouraged and become even higher and fuller, and the masses will be even bolder in exposing more problems in the work. Airing views and rectification should thus alternate and promote each other, so that the development of the movement deepens step by step. In some units where the rectification has already formed a high tide, the atmosphere of democracy has become active, the relationship between the Party and the masses has improved, there is more contact between superiors and subordinates, and the masses are more able to speak their minds freely, and a lively and vigorous political situation has begun to appear. Conversely, if the leaders abandon the large number of problems that the masses urgently demand to be solved, and only repeatedly mobilize the masses to expose major problems, the confidence of the masses will decline.

Burning away the bad things on one's body requires determination. And determination is not easy for anyone to make on any issue. In every unit, there are almost always some old problems that have been delayed for three to five years without being resolved. When the leaders of many units mention these problems, they get a headache, feeling that even the rectification movement will hardly solve these old problems. Thus, they show hesitation and retreat in the face of these problems, lacking determination. Can the rectification movement really not solve these old problems? Facts have long proven that this argument is groundless. Almost every unit can find examples of this: some old problems that have been delayed for many years without being resolved, as long as a big-character poster is put up, the leaders truly take an interest in these problems, and mobilize the masses to come up with solutions, the problems are quickly solved easily. According to inspections by some units, the reason why some problems have not been solved for a long time is mainly because the leading cadres are dragging their feet, turning a deaf ear to the opinions of the masses, and lacking strict demands on themselves. If they are still afraid that old problems cannot be solved, it is actually neither believing in the masses nor believing in themselves. If they treat rectification with this spirit, then naturally no problems can be solved. We should firmly believe that as long as we mobilize the masses, as long as everyone has a serious, responsible, mutually supportive, and mutually cooperative socialist spirit, what was usually indistinguishable between right and wrong will definitely be distinguished during rectification; what could not be solved usually will definitely be solved reasonably during rectification.

At present, it is the time when various agencies are summarizing this year's work, formulating next year's plans, and business work is quite busy. Some leading comrades feel that they cannot spare the time, and therefore do not have enough determination to vigorously carry out rectification. Under these circumstances, ensuring that rectification and business are both not neglected is certainly not an easy task. However, as long as the leaders are good at distinguishing the primary from the secondary and the urgent from the less urgent in their work, good at arranging time and manpower, and good at closely integrating rectification with work, they can completely achieve both rectification and business without neglecting either. At present, a high tide of building farmland water conservancy is being launched in rural areas across the country, and the busyness and tension of the business work of the Farmland Water Conservancy Bureau of the Ministry of Water Conservancy can be imagined. However, while holding the National Farmland Water Conservancy Conference, this bureau vigorously carried out rectification, and 74% of the problems raised by the masses were quickly resolved. It can be seen that as long as the leaders are clear-headed, ensure that the main business work is done well, even if the secondary work is slightly affected, it does not matter much. Because rectification is to solve the fundamental problems in our work and many specific problems, large and small, as long as rectification is done well, the face of our work will be completely renewed. This gain is much greater than some temporary impact on the business.

A few comrades have more serious problems in their thinking and style of work, or have made major mistakes, or encounter problems related to personal interests, and therefore take a negative attitude towards rectification, or even have great resistance. They are unwilling to seriously and humbly accept criticism from the masses, and cannot handle problems related to individuals in accordance with the principles of the Party. Some people even resist criticism and hinder the airing of views. Although there are not many such comrades, their obstruction to the movement is very great. The leading groups of various units should seize the opportunity to criticize and educate these comrades, and help them to treat the rectification movement with a correct attitude.

Launching a rectification upsurge requires great determination, but also requires specific leadership and correct methods. The masses have put forward tens of thousands of opinions, and the time for rectification is limited. Therefore, the rectification work must both ensure quality and strive for time, so as to be both fast and good.

The key to ensuring both speed and quality lies in implementing the mass line. Some people believe that airing views is a matter for the masses, while rectification is a matter for the leaders, and the masses can only raise problems but cannot solve them. This statement is completely wrong. Airing views is a mass movement under leadership, and rectification is also a mass movement under leadership; we should believe that the masses can not only raise problems, but also solve them. Some comrades have this wrong idea because they believe that handing over problems to the masses for discussion and resolution will take a long time and prevent problems from being solved quickly; or they are afraid that the masses will only see the part and not the whole, consider personal interests more and overall interests less, so that problems cannot be solved correctly. Facts have proven that this idea is completely inconsistent with reality. Some units did not pay attention to implementing the mass line at the beginning, and only a few leaders were there to rectify behind closed doors, resulting in slow rectification and poor problem solving. The masses said that this is becoming more and more bureaucratic and more and more subjective. The Bureau of Civil Affairs of the Ministry of Internal Affairs initially only had leading cadres rectifying behind closed doors, solving 20 problems, but the masses were dissatisfied with 13 of them. However, after mobilizing the masses to carry out rectification together, the problems were solved quickly and the masses were satisfied. Of course, sometimes some of the masses may have wrong views on certain issues. However, what we rely on is the majority of the masses. Moreover, correct thinking will definitely be established and promoted in mass discussions, and various erroneous ideas will be criticized and corrected. In the process of rectification, we must not only rely on the masses to solve problems, but also mobilize the masses to check the situation of rectification, so as to prevent the tendency of pursuing progress only without paying attention to quality.

Most of the opinions put forward by the masses are relatively easy to solve, but most of them belong to general and specific problems in work or mass life; a few are more difficult to solve, but are major problems, such as policies, systems, institutions, cadre demobilization, and some complex issues in life and welfare. What is the order of solving problems, is it better to solve the difficult ones first and then the easy ones, or the easy ones first and then the difficult ones? Judging from the situation of general units, it is best to solve the easy ones first and then the difficult ones, first concentrating efforts to solve those large numbers of problems that are easy to solve, and consciously postponing the difficult major problems. Many units of the central state organs have already gained experience in this regard. From mid-November to mid-month, more than 53% of the central state organs have processed more than 80% of the opinions from the airing of views, and more than 28% of the units have processed about 50% of the opinions, initially forming a rectification upsurge. Among them, some units initially focused on major problems, and the progress of rectification was very slow, and the morale of the masses was not high. Later, they changed to the method of solving the easy ones first and then the difficult ones, and solved seven or eight out of ten of the problems raised in the airing of views within ten days and a half months. This is a successful approach. Conversely, some other units have always adopted the method of solving major problems first, and as a result, major problems have not been solved for a long time, and general problems have also been left there without anyone being seriously responsible for solving them. Because they cannot see the effect of rectification, the morale of the masses quickly declines. In fact, the reason is very obvious. We say that a rectification upsurge must be launched immediately after the airing of views, because the masses have already exposed a large number of problems waiting for the leaders to solve. If the leaders ignore the large number of problems related to the broad masses and only solve three or two major problems that cannot be sorted out in ten days and a half months, the leaders will become detached from the masses. Major policy issues are inherently difficult to solve, and it is even more difficult to raise them in the early stages of rectification, because at this time, neither the leaders nor the masses are well prepared for these issues. On the other hand, solving these problems is not something that every staff member can get involved in. Comrades who cannot get involved are naturally difficult to maintain high morale. By the time the leaders solve the major problems, even if there is still time to solve those large numbers of problems, the enthusiasm of the masses has already subsided. At this time, it will take twice the effort to mobilize the masses again, and the rectification work will be less effective. Of course, some units may have some special circumstances, and there may be some problems that must be solved first, otherwise they will become an obstacle to the movement, and of course these problems should be solved first. The issue of working methods should be determined according to the actual situation.

Some comrades look down on small problems. They feel that rectification is to solve big problems, and it is not worth spending a lot of time solving trivial problems. This idea is very wrong. The so-called small problems are only in comparison with some difficult major problems, mainly meaning that they are relatively easy to solve and do not require repeated debates and research, and certainly do not mean that they are all trivial matters. Among the problems handled by the central state organs in this stage, there are many important issues related to business policies, work rules and regulations, and leadership style. Facts have proven that many small things and specific problems are precisely the concrete and prominent manifestations of the three bad styles, and they have common ideological roots with some big problems, or even the roots of some big problems. Usually, many leading comrades do not pay attention to these small things, allowing them to accumulate over time, causing problems to pile up, becoming stumbling blocks in many work, and leading personnel to develop bureaucratic habits of procrastination, fatigue, and ignoring the opinions of the masses. Now, in the rectification, the leading comrades in the organs have begun to use a vigorous and responsible attitude to solve these small problems, which can not only eliminate many obstacles in our work, but also sweep away the old-fashioned atmosphere of inertia and turning a deaf ear to problems in the organs, making people feel refreshed, and its significance and role are very far-reaching.

Will adopting the method of solving the easy ones first and then the difficult ones result in grabbing sesame seeds and losing the watermelon? Some comrades have such concerns. Whether the watermelon will be lost depends not on whether to grab the sesame seeds first, but on how to hold the watermelon. As mentioned earlier, starting to hold the watermelon may not be able to hold it well, but there is a risk of losing the sesame seeds. We believe that solving the easy ones first and then the difficult ones is, in a sense, also for the sake of better solving major problems. If a large number of specific problems are placed there without being solved, it will be difficult for the masses to concentrate their thoughts on major problems, and they will not have the experience of solving major problems; the leaders will also not be able to get rid of the entanglement of these problems. Solving these problems first will free up the leaders to solve major problems, and the attention of the masses will naturally shift over. Some people are afraid that this will squeeze out the time to solve major problems. Facts have proven that it usually only takes ten days and a half months for many units to solve general problems, and when solving general problems, the leaders can also draw some strength to prepare for solving major problems, and at the same time appropriately organize the masses to conduct some thematic airing of views and debates. Of course, if the leaders are not clear-headed, only satisfied with solving general problems, and relax the preparatory work for solving major problems, or are not clear about the overall situation and do not grasp the time well, so that they cannot solve major problems well, then even if they solve more than 90% of the problems, it cannot be said that rectification has truly solved the problems, nor can they achieve the true victory of the rectification movement. Judging from the situation of the central state organs adopting the method of solving the easy ones first and then the difficult ones, most of them have taken various measures to prepare for solving major problems while solving general problems, and the units that have solved general problems almost have already put solving major problems on the rectification agenda. It can be believed that as long as the leaders are clear-headed, they will inevitably both pick up sesame seeds and hold watermelons in the rectification stage.

### 在鸣放高潮以后要立即掀起整改高潮

    在鸣放高潮以后要立即掀起整改高潮
    整风进入第三阶段以后，大多数单位已经先后出现了大鸣大放的高潮。鸣放高潮出现以后，应该迅速发动群众掀起整改高潮。
    大鸣大放为的是大整大改。鸣放只是提出问题，整改才是解决问题。熊熊大火已经燃烧起来以后，就要让它迅速地烧掉我们身上的各种坏东西。有些同志并不反对在整风的第三阶段大力进行整改，可是他们对于是否在鸣放高潮之后立即掀起整改高潮，却还有不同的看法。他们觉得：鸣放高潮虽然已经形成，可是，一般地说，鸣放的深度还不太够，揭发出来的一般问题很多，重大问题较少；因此，还是应该等到鸣放得更深更透，重大问题揭露得更加充分更加明确的时候，再集中力量进行整改，这样，才能迅速地解决工作中的重大问题。这种想法同群众的要求和工作的需要是不一致的。现时群众的千万只眼睛正在注视着领导者的行动，要从对待这些问题的态度判断领导者对整改的决心到底有多大。领导者大力进行整改，用行动来证明自己的决心，群众的热情就会受到进一步的鼓舞而更加高涨饱满，群众就会更加大胆地揭露工作中的更多问题。鸣放和整改就应该这样互相交错、互相推动，使运动的发展步步深入。有些整改已经形成高潮的单位，民主空气活跃了，党群关系改善了，上下级之间的接触更多了，群众也比较能畅所欲言，生动活泼的政治局面开始出现了。相反地，如果领导者抛开群众迫切要求解决的大量问题，只是反复动员群众揭露大问题，群众的信心就会低落下来。
    烧掉自己身上的坏东西，这需要决心。而决心并不是任何一个人在任何一个问题上都很容易下的。每一个单位中差不多都有一些拖延了三年五载没有解决的老问题。不少单位的领导者一提起这些问题就头疼，觉得就是整风运动也很难使这些老问题得到解决。于是，在这些问题面前就表示出犹豫退缩，决心不大。整风运动真的解决不了这些老问题吗？事实早已证明了这种论调是毫无根据的。几乎每一个单位都可以找到这样的事例：一些拖延多年不能解决的老问题，只要大字报一贴，领导者真正来过问这些问题，并且动员群众来想办法，问题很快地就迎刃而解。据有些单位检查，有些问题所以长期不得解决，主要是因为领导干部拖拖拉拉，对群众意见充耳不闻，对自己缺乏严格要求。现在如果仍然怕老问题解决不了，实际上就是既不相信群众又不相信自己。如果用这种精神对待整改，那自然是什么问题也解决不了。应该坚定地相信：只要发动群众，只要大家都具有认真负责、互相支援、互相协作的社会主义精神，平时分不清的是非，整风中一定能够分清；平时解决不了的问题，整风中一定能够得到合理的解决。
    目前，正值各机关总结今年工作、制定明年计划、业务工作相当繁忙的时候。有些领导同志感到腾不出手来，因而没有足够的决心大力进行整改。在这种情况下，保证整风业务两不误，当然并不是一件十分容易的事。但是，只要领导者善于分清工作的主次和轻重缓急，善于安排时间和人力，善于使整改和工作密切结合，就完全能够做到整改和业务两不误。目前全国农村正在掀起兴修农田水利的高潮，水利部农田水利局业务工作的繁忙紧张是可想而知的。但是，这个局在召开全国农田水利会议的同时，大力进行整改，群众所提出的问题很快地就解决了74％。可见只要领导人员心中有数，保证把主要的业务工作做好，次要的工作即使稍受影响也关系不大。因为整改是要解决我们工作中的根本性问题以及许多大大小小的具体问题，只要整改得好，我们的工作面貌就会焕然一新。这收获比起业务上所受到的一些暂时影响是大得多的。
    少数同志思想作风上有比较严重的毛病，或者犯了较大的错误，或者是遇到和个人利益有关的问题，就对整改抱消极态度，甚至有很大的抵触情绪。他们不肯认真地虚心地接受群众批评，不能按照党的原则处理和个人有关的问题。有些人甚至抗拒批评、阻碍鸣放。这样的同志虽然不多，但是，他们对运动的阻碍作用是很大的。各单位的领导小组应该抓紧对这些同志进行批评和教育，帮助他们用正确的态度对待整风运动。
    掀起整改高潮需要决心大，还需要领导具体，方法对头。群众提出的意见成千上万，整改的时间有限，因此，整改工作既要保证质量又要争取时间，做到又快又好。
    保证又快又好的关键在于贯彻群众路线。有些人认为鸣放是群众的事，整改是领导的事，群众只能提出问题而不能解决问题。这种说法是完全错误的。鸣放是有领导的群众运动，整改同样是有领导的群众运动；应该相信群众不但能提出问题，也能解决问题。有些同志所以有这种错误的想法，是认为把问题交给群众讨论解决一定会拖长时间使问题不能迅速解决；或者是怕群众只看到局部而看不到全体，多考虑个人利益、少考虑整体利益，使问题不能得到正确解决。事实证明，这种想法是完全不符合实际情况的。有些单位开始没有注意贯彻群众路线，只是少数领导人在那里关门整改，结果是改得又慢，问题解决得也不好。群众说，这是越改越官僚，越改越主观。内务部优抚局开始只是领导干部关门整改，解决了二十个问题，结果有十三个问题群众不满意。而发动群众共同进行整改以后，则问题解决得又快，群众又满意。当然，有时候一部分群众对某些问题也会有错误的看法。但是，我们依靠的是群众中的多数。而且，在群众性的讨论中一定会树立和发扬正确的思想，批判和纠正各种错误思想。在整改过程中，不但要依靠群众解决问题，还要发动群众对整改的情况进行检查，以防止那种只追求进度而不注意质量的偏向。
    群众提出来的意见，绝大部分是比较容易解决的，但是大多属于工作或群众生活中的一般的具体问题；有少数是比较难解决的却是重大的问题，比如方针、政策、体制、机构、干部下放以及生活福利中的某些复杂问题。解决问题的顺序究竟是先难后易，还是先易后难好？就一般单位的情况看，最好还是先易后难，首先集中力量解决那些大量的容易解决的问题，有意识地把难解决的重大问题推后一步。中央国家机关的许多单位在这方面已经取得了经验。从11月中旬起截至本月中旬为止，中央国家机关已有53％以上的单位，处理了80％以上的鸣放意见，28％以上的单位处理了50％左右的鸣放意见，初步形成了整改高潮。其中有些单位开始的时候先抓重大问题，整改进度很迟缓，群众情绪不高，后来改用先易后难的办法，十天半月之内，就把鸣放中提出的问题解决了十之七八。这是成功的做法。相反地，另外一些单位一直采取先解决重大问题的办法，结果重大问题迟迟解决不了，一般问题也扔在那里没人认真负责解决，因为看不到整改的效果，群众的情绪很快就低落下来。其实道理是很明显的。我们说鸣放高潮之后必须立即掀起整改高潮，就是因为群众已经揭露出大量问题在那里等着领导解决。而领导上撇开大量的和广大群众有关的问题不顾，只去解决三两个十天半月内不能搞出头绪的大问题，领导就要和群众脱节。大政方针问题本来就不好解决，在整改初期提出更不好办，因为这时无论是领导和群众，对这些问题都还缺乏准备。另一方面，解决这些问题并不是每一个工作人员都能插上手的。插不上手的同志自然很难保持高涨的情绪。等到领导方面解决了重大问题，即使还有时间来解决那些大量的问题，而群众的热情却已经消沉了。这时候再回过头来发动群众，就要加倍费劲，整改工作就要事倍功半。当然有些单位可能有某些特殊情况，在他们那里可能有某些问题必须首先抓紧解决，否则将会成为运动的障碍，那当然应该首先解决这些问题。工作方法问题本来就应该根据实际情况而定。
    有些同志看不起小问题。他们觉得整风就要解决大问题，花许多时间解决鸡毛蒜皮的小问题不值得。这想法是很不正确的。所谓小问题，只是和某些难解决的重大问题比较而言，主要是说它们比较容易解决，不需要反复进行辩论和研究，决不是说它们都是鸡毛蒜皮。中央国家机关这一阶段处理的问题中，就有不少有关业务方针政策、工作规章制度以及领导作风方面的重要问题。事实证明，许多小事情和具体问题，正是三个坏主义的具体的突出的表现，它们和某些大问题有着共同的思想根源，甚至是某些大问题的根子。平常，许多领导同志不注意这些小事情，任其日积月累，使问题成堆，成为许多工作中的绊脚石，领导人员养成了拖拉疲沓、不重视群众意见的官僚主义习气。现在整改中一反常规，机关中的领导同志开始用雷厉风行、认真负责的态度来解决这些小问题，这样不但可以大量排除我们工作中的许多障碍，而且一扫机关中的那种因循守旧、对问题充耳不闻的暮气，使人耳目一新，它的意义和作用是十分深远的。
    采取先易后难的办法会不会抓了芝麻丢了西瓜呢？有些同志有这样的顾虑。是不是会丢掉西瓜，不在于是否先抓芝麻，而是看怎样去抱西瓜。一开始就去抱西瓜，如前所述，不一定能抱得很好，可是却有丢掉芝麻的危险。我们认为，先易后难，在某种意义上说，也是为了更好的解决重大问题。具体问题一大堆摆在那里不解决，群众的思想就很难集中到重大问题上来，也没有解决重大问题的经验；领导者也不可能摆脱这些问题的牵扯。先把这些问题解决了，领导者就可以腾出手来解决大问题，群众的注意力也就自然转移过来了。有人怕这样会挤掉解决重大问题的时间。事实证明，很多单位解决一般问题大多只要十天半月的功夫，而且，在解决一般问题的时候，领导者还可以抽出一些力量为解决重大问题作准备，同时适当组织群众进行一些专题鸣放和辩论。当然，如果领导者的头脑不清醒，只满足于解决一般问题，而放松了解决重大问题的准备工作，或者是心中无数，没有很好地掌握时间，以致不能很好地解决重大问题，那么，即令解决了90％以上的问题，也不能说整改真正解决了问题，也不能取得整风运动的真正胜利。就中央国家机关采用先易后难的方法的情况看，大多在解决一般问题的同时就采取各种措施为解决重大问题作准备，一般问题解决得差不多的单位，已经把解决重大问题提到整改日程上来。可以相信，只要领导思想清醒，在整改阶段就必然会既拣芝麻又抱西瓜。
