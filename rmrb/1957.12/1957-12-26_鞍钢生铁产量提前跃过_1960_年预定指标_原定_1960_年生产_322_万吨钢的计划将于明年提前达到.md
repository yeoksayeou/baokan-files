Anshan, December 18 (Reporters Chen Ji and Jin Yukun) report: Anshan Iron and Steel, China’s largest iron and steel production base, has seen its iron and steel production level advance several years ahead of the planned targets. Vice Premier Li Fuchun emphasized in his report on the First Five-Year Plan for National Economic Development: After Anshan Iron and Steel Complex basically completes the forty-eight major new construction and renovation projects by 1960, the steel production scale can be expanded to 3.22 million tons. Now, thanks to the Soviet Union's assistance in design and equipment, the support of the entire nation, and the active efforts of Anshan Iron and Steel's employees, the production level originally planned to be reached after 1960 will be achieved ahead of schedule next year. This year, Anshan Iron and Steel's annual steel production has reached about 2.9 million tons, about 600,000 tons more than the target set by the First Five-Year Plan, and about 2.1 million tons more than the annual output in 1952. The original plan was to expand the annual pig iron production to 2.5 million tons after 1960. This year, Anshan Iron and Steel's pig iron production has already reached more than 3.3 million tons, exceeding the target by more than 800,000 tons three years ahead of schedule.

The reason why Anshan Iron and Steel's iron and steel production has been able to advance so rapidly is mainly due to the state's positive attitude towards promoting Anshan Iron and Steel, coupled with the Soviet Union's selfless assistance and the creative learning of Soviet experience by the workers, which greatly shortened the process of mastering modern and latest technologies. What is particularly encouraging is that many technical and economic indicators have now reached relatively advanced levels. Before liberation, the utilization coefficient of Anshan Iron and Steel's blast furnaces was 1.77, meaning that 1.77 cubic meters of effective furnace volume was required to smelt one ton of iron. This year, Anshan Iron and Steel's ironmaking workers have further promoted advanced experiences and new technologies such as high-temperature, humid-air operation and high-basicity self-fluxing sintered ore, reducing the effective volume occupied for smelting one ton of iron to about 0.705 cubic meters. This is equivalent to the fact that a blast furnace with the same effective volume now produces pig iron equivalent to two and a half blast furnaces before liberation. Before liberation, the highest utilization coefficient of Anshan Iron and Steel's steelmaking plant open hearth furnaces was 3.23, meaning that 3.23 tons of steel could be produced per square meter of hearth area, while the First Steelmaking Plant has recently reached 8.2 tons.

In recent years, Anshan Iron and Steel has also actively trial-produced and increased a large number of new products, such as heavy rails, large I-beams, large channel steel, seamless steel pipes, alloy seamless steel pipes, cold-drawn steel pipes, high-quality steel plates, silicon steel sheets, and boiler steel plates, supporting the production and construction needs of various domestic departments. In 1952, Anshan Iron and Steel could only supply more than 500 products to the country, but now it can supply more than 5,000, which is equivalent to ten times that of 1952.

Currently, Anshan Iron and Steel is considering increasing the annual steel production to more than 4 million tons during the Second Five-Year Plan period, without basically requiring state investment or increasing a large amount of equipment. (Attached picture)

The plan to build six large blast furnaces in Anshan, as stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan, has been completed ahead of schedule this year. At present, Anshan Iron and Steel already has nine large blast furnaces smelting high-quality pig iron day and night.

    鞍钢生铁产量提前跃过1960年预定指标
    原定1960年生产322万吨钢的计划将于明年提前达到
    本报鞍山18日电　记者陈迹、金雨困报道：我国规模最大的钢铁生产基地——鞍钢的钢铁生产水平已经比预定的计划向前跃进了几年。李富春副总理曾经在关于发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的报告中着重提到：鞍山钢铁联合企业到1960年，基本上完成四十八项主要新建改建工程后，钢的生产规模可以扩大到三百二十二万吨。现在由于苏联在设计和设备上的帮助，全国的支援，以及鞍钢职工积极努力，这个计划在1960年以后达到的生产水平，将在明年提前达到。今年鞍钢的钢的年产量已达到二百九十万吨左右，比第一个五年计划规定的指标多六十万吨左右，比1952年的年产量多二百一十万吨左右。原来计划在1960年后把生铁年产量扩大到二百五十万吨。今年鞍钢的生铁产量就已达到三百三十多万吨，提前三年超过指标八十多万吨。
    鞍钢的钢铁生产所以能够如此迅速地跃进，主要是由于国家对鞍钢采取了积极的促进的态度，加上苏联无私的帮助和职工群众创造性地学习苏联经验，大大地缩短了掌握现代最新技术的过程。特别令人鼓舞的是：目前已有许多技术经济指标达到了比较先进的水平。解放前鞍山的炼铁高炉利用系数是一点七七，即每炼一吨铁需用高炉的有效容积一点七七立方公尺。今年鞍钢炼铁工人进一步推广了高温湿风操作法、高碱度自熔性烧结矿等先进经验和新技术，每炼一吨铁所占用的有效容积已降低到零点七零五立方公尺左右。这就等于现在一个同样有效容积的高炉炼出的生铁要相当于解放前的二个半高炉。解放前鞍钢炼钢厂平炉最高的利用系数是三点二三，即每平方公尺炉底能出三点二三吨钢，而第一炼钢厂最近已达八点二吨。
    鞍钢几年来还积极试制和增加了大量新品种，如重轨、大型工字钢、大型槽钢、无缝钢管、合金无缝钢管、冷拔钢管、优质钢板、矽钢片及锅炉钢板等，支援了国内各部门生产和建设的需要。1952年鞍钢只能供给全国五百多种产品，现在已能供给五千多种，相当于1952年的十倍。
    目前鞍钢正考虑在基本上不要国家投资和增加大量设备的条件下，在第二个五年计划期内使钢的年产量跃进到四百万吨以上。（附图片）
    第一个五年计划规定在鞍山建设六座大型高炉的计划今年已经提前完成。目前，鞍钢已经拥有九座大型高炉在日夜不停地冶炼着优质生铁。
