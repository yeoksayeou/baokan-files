Hubei's Agricultural Production Achieves Comprehensive Leap Forward
Guizhou Exceeds the Five-Year Plan's Grain Production Increase Target

    This newspaper reports that Hubei Province has achieved tremendous success in agricultural production this year. The province's total grain output reached 21.9 billion jin, an increase of 5.3% compared to the bumper year of 1956 and an increase of 30% compared to 1952. New high-yield records have emerged in many areas. The province has achieved its agricultural development targets ahead of schedule. There are eleven counties with an average grain yield of over 800 jin per mu, namely Xiaogan, Huangpi, Xinzhou, Xishui, Macheng, Hongan, Guangji, Yunmeng, Dawu, Hanyang, and Hanchuan, among which Xiaogan's yield reached 1,004 jin per mu. In forty-five counties, grain output increased by 20% to 50% or more compared to 1955, and in eleven counties, the average grain yield per mu for the entire county ranged from 1,005 jin to 1,474 jin.
    The province's cotton output reached 4.3 million dan, an increase of 13.2% compared to the bumper year of 1956 and an increase of 61% compared to 1952. Macheng and Guangji counties achieved an average yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu. In thirty-nine counties, cotton output increased by 30% to more than double compared to 1955. The province's grain, cotton, and other crop production have all exceeded the targets set in the first Five-Year Plan (with oilseed production completing 90% of the target).
    The fundamental reason why Hubei Province's agricultural production was able to achieve such tremendous results this year is that the broad masses and cadres accumulated relatively rich experience and lessons in the second year of cooperativization, while fully exploiting the superiority of cooperativization and overcoming the severe drought and various natural disasters this year. Secondly, the Party committees at all levels correctly implemented the policy of overall planning and strengthened leadership, enabling a more reasonable arrangement for the production of various crops with grain as the center. Thirdly, in many areas, there was less bureaucracy and less subjectivism on the part of the leadership; the leadership dug deep, grasped firmly, saw clearly, and worked with great enthusiasm in developing agricultural production. In other words, these areas were able to lead production with an innovative spirit, resolutely relying on the masses, and using the mass line method.
    The tremendous achievements in Hubei Province's agricultural production have created favorable conditions for achieving a great leap forward in agricultural production in the future. At present, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China requires that the output of grain, cotton, and oilseeds all increase by more than 10% in the first year of the second Five-Year Plan—1958—and is currently revising the comprehensive plan for developing agricultural production in the province over the next ten years.

    Xinhua News Agency reports that the total grain output of Guizhou Province this year is 10.6 billion jin, an increase of 9.3% over last year, which has exceeded the grain production increase target stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan.
    One of the characteristics of Guizhou Province's grain production increase this year is that high-yield townships and agricultural cooperatives have emerged everywhere. The average grain yield per mu in Guangming Township, Zhengan County, was 977 jin, an increase of 177% compared to before liberation and an increase of 76% compared to before agricultural cooperativization. The production and living standards of the farmers in the entire township have now exceeded the level of prosperous middle peasants. Yanpen Agricultural Cooperative in Chayan Township, Zunyi County, located in a barren, high-altitude mountainous area, achieved an average yield of 1,003 jin per mu on 140.9 mu of land this year, more than double the yield before liberation. Miao farmers in the Bawan Mountain area of the Miaoling Mountains planted more than 100 mu of dry rice on newly reclaimed land this year, with an average yield of 480 jin per mu, creating the highest dry rice yield per mu in the province.

    钻得深　抓得紧　干劲大
    湖北农业生产全面跃进
    贵州超额完成五年计划的粮食增产任务
    本报讯　今年湖北省的农业生产获得巨大的成绩。全省粮食产量达到二百一十九亿斤，比丰收的1956年增长了5.3％，比1952年增长了30％。不少地区出现了新的高额丰产纪录。全省提前达到农业发展指标，平均亩产粮食八百斤以上的有十一个县，即孝感、黄陂、新洲、浠水、麻城、红安、广济、云梦、大悟、汉阳、汉川，其中孝感亩产一千零四斤。全省有四十五个县粮食产量比1955年增产20％至50％以上，有十一个县全县每亩平均粮食产量由一千零五斤至一千四百七十四斤。
    全省棉花产量达到四百三十万担，比丰收的1956年增长了13.2％，比1952年增长了61％，皮棉平均亩产百斤的有麻城、广济两个县，有三十九个县棉花产量比1955年增产30％到两倍以上。全省粮棉和其他作物生产都超额完成了第一个五年计划（其中油料生产完成90％）。
    今年湖北省农业生产能够取得这样巨大的成绩，根本原因在于广大群众和干部在合作化的第二年积累了比较丰富的经验和教训，同时充分发挥合作化的优越性，战胜了今年的大旱灾和各种自然灾害。其次，各级党委正确执行了全面规划，加强领导的方针，使各种作物生产以粮食为中心进行比较合理的安排。第三，有不少地区，领导上官僚主义较少，主观主义较少；领导上对发展农业生产钻得深、抓得紧、看得透、干劲大，就是说，这些地区能以革新的精神，坚决依靠群众，运用群众路线的方法来领导生产。
    湖北省农业生产获得巨大的成绩，对于今后实现农业生产大跃进创造了有利条件。目前中共湖北省委要求在第二个五年计划的头一年——1958年粮棉油料的产量都增加10％以上，同时正在修订今后十年全省发展农业生产的全面规划。
    据新华社讯　贵州省今年粮食总产量为一百零六亿斤，比去年增产9.3％，已超额完成第一个五年计划所规定的粮食增产任务。
    贵州省今年粮食增产的特点之一，是各地都出现了一些高额丰产的乡和农业社。正安县光明乡平均每亩产粮九百七十七斤，比解放前增产177％，比农业合作化前增产76％。现在全乡农民的生产和生活水平，都已超过了富裕中农的水平。遵义县查堰乡堰盆农业社，处在土地贫瘠的高寒山区，今年一百四十点九亩田，平均每亩产量一千零三斤，比解放前提高一倍以上。苗岭山区八万山一带的苗族农民，今年在新开荒地上所种的一百多亩旱稻，平均每亩产量四百八十斤，创造了全省旱稻亩产的最高纪录。
