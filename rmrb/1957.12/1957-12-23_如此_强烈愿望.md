Such a "Strong Desire"
After Dulles returned to Washington, he said that the Paris Conference's decision demonstrated a "strong desire to get the Soviet Union back to participate in… disarmament negotiations."

Washington officials made a truthful annotation to Dulles's "strong desire." These officials said that, according to Dulles's idea, such negotiations would not involve the substance of disarmament, and even if such discussions were held, the United States would not necessarily participate.

After this annotation, people can clearly see that the "strong desire" expressed by the North Atlantic Group's Paris Conference resolution is not a desire to discuss disarmament issues, but merely a propaganda trick.

    如此“强烈愿望”
    杜勒斯回到华盛顿后说，巴黎会议的决定表明了“要争取苏联回来参加……裁军谈判的强烈愿望”。
    华盛顿的官员们为杜勒斯的这种“强烈愿望”作了一番如实的注解。这些官员们说，照杜勒斯的设想，这种谈判不会涉及裁军的实质问题，并且即使举行这种讨论，美国也不一定会参加。
    经此一番注释，人们可以清楚地看出北大西洋集团巴黎会议的决议所表现的那种“强烈愿望”，并不是什么要讨论裁军问题的愿望，只不过是一个宣传花招而已。
