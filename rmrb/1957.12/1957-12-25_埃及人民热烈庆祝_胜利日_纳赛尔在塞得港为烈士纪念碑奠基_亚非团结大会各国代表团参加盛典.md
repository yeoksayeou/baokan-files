    纳赛尔在塞得港为烈士纪念碑奠基
    亚非团结大会各国代表团参加盛典
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：埃及总统纳赛尔23日在塞得港参加了庆祝英法侵略军撤出塞得港一周年的“胜利日”盛大纪念活动。他和埃及议会议长、内阁部长们在当天上午从开罗乘专车到达塞得港。
    纳赛尔等一行人在到达以后不久立即前往烈士墓，并敬献花圈。当纳赛尔乘着敞篷汽车通过主要街道前往墓地时，街上、房屋窗口和屋顶上拥挤着数以千计的人向他致意。他们一行人还视察了在英法侵埃战争以后兴建的新房屋地区，这些房屋是为那些住房被战争破坏的居民建筑的。
    在市内的行政公署广场上举行了庄严的仪式，纳赛尔为烈士纪念碑安置了奠基石，并且在广场中心升起一面给塞得港的特别旗帜，以表彰这个城市在抵抗侵略的战斗中显示的英勇精神。接着举行了军事检阅。参加检阅的武装部队是在反侵略战争中作过战的那些部队。米格式和伊柳辛式飞机结成队形在检阅队伍上空飞翔。
    下午，纳赛尔在市运动场发表了一篇重要演说。
    埃及全国各地在这一天也普遍地举行了热烈的庆祝活动。
    出席亚非团结大会的苏联、中国和其他国家的代表团23日应邀到塞得港参加庆祝“胜利日”活动。
    以郭沫若为首的中国代表团参观军事检阅后，23日下午在为抵抗英法侵略而牺牲的烈士墓前献了花圈。
    郭沫若在献花圈后说，烈士们的牺牲换来了塞得港的光复，使英法侵略军的最后一个士兵在一年以前从这里撤退。他说：“我们愿意在争取和平的斗争中踏着先烈的血迹前进”。
    苏联、蒙古、朝鲜、越南的代表团也在烈士墓前献了花圈，并且致词悼念烈士。
    大马士革消息：叙利亚人民抵抗军、青年军人员和大马士革居民23日举行游行，庆祝英法侵略军撤出塞得港一周年。
    大马士革街道上挤满了游行者，他们高举火炬，欢唱爱国歌曲，纪念这个反侵略“胜利日”。
    据叙利亚新闻社报道，大约有三万名人民抵抗军人员参加了游行。
