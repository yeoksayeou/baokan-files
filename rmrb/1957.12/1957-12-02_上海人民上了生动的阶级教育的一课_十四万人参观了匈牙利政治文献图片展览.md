Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 1st. The seventy-two sets of pictures and texts introducing the truth about the Hungarian Incident gave the people of Shanghai a vivid lesson in class education. Since the "Hungarian Political Documents and Pictures Exhibition" opened in Shanghai on November 10th and ended today, more than 140,000 people have visited it. After seeing the exhibition, many workers, soldiers, young students, and government cadres excitedly wrote down their feelings: "Kindness to the enemy is cruelty to the people." "It is a daydream for imperialism to try to overthrow the achievements of socialism and restore the capitalist system." "Salute to the Hungarian people and the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party who are determined to fight against the counter-revolutionaries!" Many people left messages expressing their deep gratitude to the Soviet Union for its timely and just assistance to Hungary after seeing the brutality of the imperialists and counter-revolutionaries in Hungary. More viewers said: After seeing the exhibition, they have a deeper understanding of the importance of our country's anti-Rightist struggle and the necessity of ideological remolding of intellectuals. Many viewers carefully recorded the materials on display and went back to tell their comrades and relatives. Some people even used these conclusive facts to powerfully refute the Rightists' slander of the Hungarian Incident at meetings.
    After its conclusion in Shanghai, the "Hungarian Political Documents and Pictures Exhibition" will be moved to Guangzhou.

    新华社上海1日电　介绍匈牙利事件真相的七十二组图文、照片，给上海人民上了生动的阶级教育的一课。“匈牙利政治文献图片展览”从11月10日在上海展出以来到今天结束为止，已有十四万多人前往参观。许多工人、战士、青年学生和机关干部看了展览以后，激动地写下了自己的感想：“对敌人的仁慈，就是对人民的残忍。”“帝国主义想推翻社会主义成果、复辟资本主义制度，这等于白日作梦。”“向坚决与反革命作斗争的匈牙利人民和匈牙利社会主义工人党致敬！”许多人留言表示看到帝国主义和反革命分子在匈牙利的残暴行为后，深深感谢苏联对匈牙利及时的正义的援助。更多的观众表示：看了展览以后，更深刻地认识到我国反右派斗争的重要意义和知识分子改造的必要性。许多观众详细地记录了展出的材料，回去转告自己的同伴和亲人，有的人还用这些确凿的事实在会议上有力地驳斥了右派分子对匈牙利事件的污蔑。
