    Deli Temple Fruit Tree Cooperative Achieves a Bumper Harvest
　　Expands Public Accumulation, and Reserves More Funds
    (Our Dispatch) The Deli Temple Fruit Tree Production Cooperative in Fuxian County, Liaoning Province, has achieved another bumper harvest this year. The total income of the cooperative has increased by 25.4% compared to last year.
    The Cooperative Management Committee believes that since the income of the vast majority of cooperative members has increased this year, and their lives have generally improved, the cooperative is in a position to further increase public accumulation. During the autumn harvest distribution, in addition to retaining 10% of the net income as public accumulation fund and 2% as public welfare fund, the cooperative also retained more than 90,900 yuan as a living reserve fund, prepared for making up for lean years with good years and for the members' advance payments for the coming year. This can not only ensure the stability of the members' lives, but also enable the cooperative to have sufficient funds to continuously expand production.
    This year, the remuneration for each work day is 1.70 yuan, an increase of 0.20 yuan compared to last year. The average income per household can reach 680 yuan, 21.66 yuan more than last year. The average income per person is 126.35 yuan, 7.72 yuan more than last year.
    After the autumn harvest distribution plan was submitted to all members for discussion, everyone believed that the method of reserving living reserve funds was excellent, as it can enable members to have a steady stream of income and avoid waste.
    The Deli Temple Cooperative was established in 1952 (as a primary cooperative) and transformed into an advanced cooperative in 1955. By the autumn of this year, the accumulated public accumulation totaled more than 721,000 yuan. Tan Guolin, the director of the cooperative, said: "We cannot be satisfied with the existing achievements. We must make further efforts to improve winter production this year and strive for another comprehensive bumper harvest in 1958." (Liu Huichun)

### 得利寺果树合作社大丰收　扩大公共积累　多留储备资金

    得利寺果树合作社大丰收
　　扩大公共积累　多留储备资金
    本报讯　辽宁省复县得利寺果树生产合作社，今年又获得了大丰收，全社总收入比去年增加了25.4％。
    社务管理委员会认为，由于今年绝大多数社员增加了收入，生活普遍有了改善，合作社已经具备进一步增加公共积累的条件了。在秋收分配的时候，这个社除从纯收入中留出10％的公积金和2％的公益金外，还留出了九万零九百多元作为生活储备金，准备以丰补歉和用做社员的来年预支，这样既可保证社员生活的稳定，又可使合作社有充足的资金来不断地扩大生产。
    今年每个劳动日的报酬是一元七角，比去年增加二角。平均每户的收入能达六百八十元，比去年多分二十一元六角六分，平均每人收入一百二十六元三角五分，比去年多分七元七角二分。
    秋收分配方案交给全体社员讨论以后，大家认为留生活储备金的办法太好了，这样可以使社员生活细水长流，可以避免浪费。
    得利寺社从1952年成立（初级社），1955年转为高级社，到今年秋季，积存的公共积累共七十二万一千多元。这个社的主任谭国林说：“我们不能满足于现有的成绩，还要进一步努力，搞好今年冬季生产，争取1958年再来一个全面大丰收。”　（刘辉春）
