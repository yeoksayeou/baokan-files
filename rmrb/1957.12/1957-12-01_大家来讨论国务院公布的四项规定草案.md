The workers of the Fifth Construction Site of the Beijing First Construction Engineering Company discussed the four draft provisional regulations on worker and staff retirement, etc., issued by the State Council on the evenings of November 28th and 29th. They put forward supplementary and revised opinions on the four drafts. The following is a record of the opinions of one of the carpentry groups. Most of the workers in this group are skilled technicians from Shanghai.

Retirement Age Should Be Specified According to Occupation

Chen Jinru said: "The draft stipulates that the retirement age for workers is 60. I think this age is not suitable for carpenters. The most important thing for carpenters is to have clear eyesight in order to accurately grasp the dimensions of the woodwork. But most of us carpenters lose our clear vision before the age of 60. There is a saying in the South: 'A young craftsman, an old doctor,' which means that a craftsman cannot be too old, because he will not be able to see clearly and work. But the older a traditional Chinese medicine doctor is, the more experienced he becomes. Therefore, I think the retirement age should be specified according to different types of work." Some people also suggested that the funeral allowance given to retired workers after their death is too small. Zhang Shibao said: "The funeral allowance is the last sum of money the state gives to retired workers. If the retired worker does not have a large family burden, then giving him six to nine months of retirement pay as a funeral allowance is sufficient. But if his family burden is large, even nine months of retirement pay is not enough. I suggest giving retired workers with large burdens more funeral allowance, or the local government should find ways to provide relief to his family." Cao Abao suggested that the state should try to provide temporary job opportunities to retired workers with heavy family burdens. Pan Fangguo and others also raised the following questions: Are carpenters among the construction workers considered to be working at high altitudes? Which provision should their retirement age be based on?

Retirement Due to Work-Related Injury Should Be Treated Preferentially

Regarding the issue of resignation, Zhang Youtu raised an opinion: "For workers who resign due to loss of working ability, they should be treated differently according to the different reasons for their loss of working ability. For example, two workers both resigned due to loss of working ability, but one worker was injured on the job, and the other was caused by his own illness. Then, the government should treat the worker who lost his working ability due to work-related injury preferentially and should not treat him as an ordinary resignation. I hope there will be clear provisions on this." Tao Fugen said, "What is 'resignation processing'?" I hope it will be specifically stipulated in the measures.

It is Suggested That Workers in the North and South Be Mutually Transferred to Work Closer to Home

When the workers discussed the State Council's provisional regulations on the vacation and wage benefits for workers and staff to visit their families, worker Fu Renzhen calculated the travel expenses for returning home: "For example, my family of three all depends on me to support them. If I work near Shanghai, then it will cost 32 yuan for me to return to Shanghai to visit my family, which will not affect our life. But now I am in Beijing, and it costs dozens of yuan to return to Shanghai to visit my family, which exceeds half of my salary. Although it is stipulated that I can get a subsidy, half a month's salary is also paid for travel expenses, and the salary for half a month's vacation is equivalent to not receiving it, and the family's life becomes a problem." Tao Fugen suggested that workers in the South should return to work in the South, and workers in the North should also return to the North. He said: "This will not only save the state's expenses for subsidizing workers to return home to visit relatives, but also facilitate our family members to return to their hometowns for production. I hope the government will consider this suggestion."

Master Apprenticeships Should Consider Mutual Willingness

The group of workers is also concerned about the regulations on the learning period and living allowances for apprentices. Many skilled veteran workers believe that the stipulated three-year apprenticeship period and the amount of living allowances are reasonable. In addition, they also made some suggestions. Pan Fangguo said: "Under the unified arrangement of the state, when the master and apprentice sign a contract, it is best to consider the mutual willingness of both parties. In this way, it can further encourage the master and apprentice to teach and learn earnestly, and the relationship between the two parties will be more harmonious." He suggested that this point be written into the regulations. Tao Fugen suggested that the government should consider whether he can give priority to bringing his own children when he brings apprentices. (Zhang Wei)

The Wages of General Laborers Are Indeed High

I am a general laborer in the letterpress workshop of the Beijing Xinhua Printing Factory, responsible for cleaning the workshop. When our factory studied and discussed the State Council's draft provisional regulations on the wage treatment of ordinary workers and general laborers in enterprises, institutions, and state organs, I wholeheartedly supported it.

I used to farm in the countryside. It will have a negative impact on farmers if people like me, who do simple physical labor in factories (sweeping, pouring spittoons, cleaning toilets), receive a monthly salary of 45 yuan. If this phenomenon of excessively high wages is not changed, it will indeed encourage farmers to flow to cities, affecting the worker-peasant alliance. In order to build socialism and strengthen the worker-peasant relationship, I personally believe that the wage standards for ordinary workers and general laborers should be adjusted. The draft regulations of the State Council correctly solve this problem.

### 大家来讨论国务院公布的四项规定草案

　　大家来讨论国务院公布的四项规定草案
    北京市第一建筑工程公司第五工地的工人们，在11月28、29两个晚上，讨论了国务院发布的关于工人、职员退休等四项暂行规定草案。他们对四个草案提出了补充、修改的意见。下面记下来的是其中的一个木工小组的意见。这个小组里大部分是从上海来的熟练的技术工人。
    退休年限应按工种规定
    陈进如说：“工人退休的年限，在草案上规定是六十岁。我看，这个年限对木工不适合。木工重要的是要眼睛看得清，才能精确的掌握木活的尺寸。而我们木工都是不到六十岁，眼睛就看不清了。在南方有一句俗话叫“少年手艺老郎中”，意思就是说，作手艺的人年纪不能太老了，老了就看不清、作不动，而中医的年纪越老就越有经验。所以，我认为退休的年限最好根据不同的工种来规定。”有的人也提出草案规定退休工人去世后给的安家费少了。张石宝说：“安家费是国家给退休工人的最后一次钱，如果退休工人家庭负担不大，那给他发六至九个月的退休费安家是不少的；如果他的家庭负担大，即使给他九个月的退休费也不够。我建议给负担大的退休工人多发些安家费，或者由当地政府设法救济他的家庭。”曹阿宝建议国家尽量给家庭负担大的退休工人作临时工的机会。潘芳国等还提出这样的疑问：建筑工人中的木工算不算高空作业呢？他们的退休年限应该按哪一条规定？
    因公伤退职应受到优待
    对退职问题，张有土提出了意见：“对于因丧失劳动力而退职的工人，应该根据他丧失劳动力的不同原因，区别对待。比如，两个工人同样是由于丧失劳动力而退职，但是，有一个工人是因为公伤，另一个是由于自己的病造成的。那么，政府就应该优待那个因公伤而丧失劳动力的工人，不应作一般退职处理。希望对此有明确规定。”陶福根说，“退职处理”是怎么个处理呢？希望在办法中具体规定一下。
　　建议南北方工人互调回家工作
    工人们讨论到国务院关于工人、职员回家探亲的假期和工资待遇的暂行规定时，工人甫仁珍对回家探亲的路费算了一笔账：“比如，我家有三口人都靠我养活。我要在上海附近工作，那我回上海探亲三十二元钱就够了，不会影响生活。但我现在北京，回上海探亲路费得好几十元，超过了我的一半工资。虽然规定可以补助，可是我的半个月的工资也付给了路费，半个月假期中的工资就等于没有领，家人的生活就成问题。”陶福根建议南方的工人回南方工作，北方的工人也回北方去。他说：“这样作，既节省了国家补助工人回家探亲的开支，也便于我们的家属回乡生产。这个建议希望政府考虑。”
　  师傅带徒弟照顾双方自愿
    小组工人对学徒的学习期限和生活补贴的规定也很关心。许多技术熟练的老工人都认为规定学徒的学习期限三年和生活补贴的数目是合理的。另外，他们也提了些意见。潘芳国说：“在服从国家统一安排下，师傅和徒弟订合同时，最好还能照顾双方自愿。这样，可以进一步鼓励师傅和徒弟认真的教和认真的学，双方的关系也会更融洽。”他建议把这一点写到规定上去。陶福根建议政府考虑，自己如果带徒弟时，是否可以优先带自己的子女。　（张碨）
    勤杂工的工资确实高
    我是北京新华印刷厂活版车间的勤杂工，负责车间的清扫工作。当我们厂学习讨论了国务院关于企业、事业单位和国家机关中普通工和勤杂工的工资待遇暂行规定草案时，我是从心眼里拥护。
    我过去也在农村种过地，像我这样在工厂作简单的体力劳动（扫地、倒痰盂、扫厕所），每月拿四十五元工资，对农民是会产生不好影响的。如果不改变这种工资偏高的现象，确实会助长农民往城市里流，影响工农联盟。为了建设社会主义，为了加强工农关系，我个人认为应该调整普通工和勤杂工的工资待遇标准。国务院的规定草案正是正确地解决了这个问题。
