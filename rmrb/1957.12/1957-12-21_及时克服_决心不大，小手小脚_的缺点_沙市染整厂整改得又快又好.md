Promptly Overcome the Shortcomings of "Lack of Determination, Half-heartedness"
Shashi Dyeing and Weaving Factory Rectifies Quickly and Well

(Our newspaper's correspondent Wang Rong reports) The Shashi Dyeing and Weaving Factory, a joint state-private enterprise in Hubei Province, promptly overcame the shortcomings of "lack of determination, half-heartedness" in its rectification work, enabling the rectification to proceed quickly and well, and the enterprise to take on a completely new look.

During the period of great airing of views and full expression of opinions, the factory's employees posted more than 800 big-character posters (an average of nearly five per person), putting forward 1,594 suggestions. These suggestions covered a wide range of areas, and the vast majority of them were correct. However, after entering the stage of focusing on rectification, the branch committee members spent three days searching through the opinions of the masses and only found three opinions that they thought could be improved, and did not propose any specific improvement measures. Many employees criticized, "The leaders lack sincerity in improving their work."

The Shashi Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party promptly criticized their shortcomings of "lack of determination, half-heartedness" in the rectification. The factory's Party branch then held a series of symposiums to listen to the opinions of employees from all aspects on the rectification work, and then held a branch committee meeting to comprehensively examine the shortcomings and problems in the rectification work. The examination revealed that the branch committee members' understanding of the rectification work was inconsistent. The branch committee members who had just arrived at the factory had no concerns about the rectification work, but were afraid that if they performed too actively, it would affect the unity between the leaders; some branch committee members believed that although they had shortcomings, they were not serious, and that the opinions raised by the masses were one-sided, so they did not humbly listen to the criticism of the masses and did not face up to their own shortcomings and errors; some branch committee members with more shortcomings in their work and life also believed that some of the special treatments that should not have been enjoyed in the past should be abolished, but they were afraid that exposing their shortcomings in front of the masses would reduce their prestige and make it difficult to work, so they "protected their weaknesses and feared pain," and evaded the rectification work; some branch committee members even mistakenly believed that the rectification was a means to carry out great debates and unite the masses, and that it was enough to change a few things to show their attitude. The branch committee made an in-depth analysis and serious criticism of these ideas, which straightened out the attitudes of the leaders. This cleared the ideological obstacles for vigorously carrying out the rectification work.

After the factory's leaders made the determination to thoroughly rectify, they not only took the employees' opinions seriously, but also further traced the root of the problems raised by the employees. For example, what kind of leadership methods are not generalized? What are the ideological roots of leaders living in more houses and receiving more subsidies? ... They conducted in-depth analysis and research on these issues. Some leading cadres with privileged ideas made self-criticisms in front of the masses and returned some of the special treatments that should not have been enjoyed within a time limit. At the same time, they also established a system whereby factory-level leaders take turns visiting employees' homes every Sunday, hold a workers' symposium once a week, and go deep into the workshops every morning to study and solve problems with the workers.

The poor quality of the factory's food was a problem that employees had long been concerned about but had not been completely resolved. During the airing of views, employees also raised the issue that "the food is expensive, there is little oil, there are few varieties of vegetables, and the taste is not good." In the past, the factory's leaders believed that the lack of oil was a problem of the entire supply plan, and that the food was expensive and not cheaper than in brother factories. This time, they did not treat the opinions of the masses in this way, but believed that this was related to the daily lives of all employees and should be resolved quickly. They immediately mobilized the cooks to raise eight pigs to solve the problem of insufficient oil and meat supply; strengthened the political and ideological work of the cooks, helped them find ways to practice thrift, increase the variety of dishes, and improve cooking methods; and mobilized cadres to reclaim wasteland in their spare time, planting more than one mu of green vegetables. The employees saw the actual effects of the rectification, and the big-character posters that had once been depressed were once again dazzling, and a mass rectification upsurge was set off.

In order to rely on the enthusiasm of the masses to thoroughly rectify, the factory's leaders also handed over the most thorny problems—the wage problem and the transfer of cadres to lower levels—to the masses for discussion. After discussion by the masses, these two problems were also successfully resolved. More than 90% of the cadres have applied to the leaders to be transferred to lower levels, and the plan to streamline the organization is being implemented smoothly.

By mid-November, more than 86% of the problems that could be solved in the factory had been resolved. In order to make the rectification work more thorough, they organized an inspection team including personnel from all aspects through the employees' representative meeting to inspect the problems that had been resolved one by one. The results confirmed that the vast majority of the problems were resolved properly, and the masses expressed satisfaction. The inspection also found that four problems could be solved but had not been solved, that the improvement measures for six problems had not been implemented well, and at the same time, 27 new problems were identified, and the leaders dealt with these problems again. Now, the factory has completely dealt with the correct opinions raised by the employees, and has truly achieved "everything is managed by someone, and every item has a solution." In order to consolidate the results of this rectification, various corresponding systems have also been formulated.

At present, a new atmosphere has emerged in the factory. The factory-level leaders have changed their style of relying solely on reports from workshop and functional department heads for everything, and often go deep into the workshops or grassroots to understand the situation. Factory Director Zhang Xiaohai found that the quality of vulcanized blue cloth in the dyeing workshop was not good, and immediately convened two symposiums with production workers, accepted four suggestions made by the workers, and the rate of qualified products rose from 90.3% to 93% the next day. The leaders are more concerned about the lives of the employees. Before the arrival of winter, they instructed the general affairs department to prepare bedding straw for the workers. During holidays, factory-level leaders went to visit workers' families separately, and the relationship between superiors and subordinates was as close as family. The enthusiasm of employees for production has soared unprecedentedly. In the past, the quality of the factory's products rarely reached national standards. Since October, the quality has reached 100% of the requirements. As of November 20, the total output value plan for the whole year has been completed by 104.51%, the profit plan has been completed by 101.67%, the cost has been reduced by 10.428% compared with the annual plan, and 11 new products have been successfully trial-produced.

    及时克服“决心不大，小手小脚”的缺点
    沙市染整厂整改得又快又好
    本报讯  通讯员王融报道：湖北省公私合营沙市染整厂及时克服了整改工作中“决心不大，小手小脚”的缺点，使整改工作进行得又快又好，企业面貌焕然一新。
    这个厂的职工在大鸣大放阶段贴出了八百多张大字报（平均每人将近五张），提出意见一千五百九十四条。这些意见涉及的方面很广，而且绝大部分是正确的。但是转入着重整改阶段以后，支部委员在群众意见中找了三天，才找到了三条认为能改进的意见，也没有提出具体的改进措施。许多职工批评说：“领导对改进工作缺乏诚意。”
    中共沙市委员会及时批评了他们这种在整改中“决心不大，小手小脚”的缺点。这个厂的党支部随即召开了一系列的座谈会，听取了各方面职工对整改工作的意见，接着召开支委会，全面检查了整改工作中的缺点和问题。检查中发现，支委、委员们对整改工作的认识是不一致的。刚来厂不久的支委，对整改工作没有顾虑，但是怕自己表现得太积极了会影响领导之间的团结；有的支委认为，自己虽有缺点，但不严重，群众提的意见是片面的，因而不虚心听取群众的批评，不正视自己的缺点和错误；有的工作和生活上缺点较多的支委，也认为以前的某些不应享受的特殊待遇应该取消，但是怕在群众面前公开了自己的短处，会降低威信，不好工作，因而“护短怕痛”，对整改工作躲躲闪闪；有的支委甚至错误地认为，整改是为了开展大辩论和团结群众的手段，改几条表示表示态度就行了。支委会对这些思想进行了深刻的分析和严肃的批判，使领导人员都端正了态度。这便为大张旗鼓地开展整改工作扫除了思想障碍。
    这个厂的领导人员在下了彻底整改的决心以后，不但能认真对待职工的意见，而且能根据职工提出的问题，进一步追根索源。如什么样的领导方法才不一般化？领导多住房子和多拿补助费的思想根源何在？……这些问题，他们都进行了深入的分析研究。一些有特权思想的领导干部都在群众面前作了检讨，并将不应该享受的某些特殊待遇限期退回。同时，他们还建立了厂级负责人每星期日轮流到职工家庭访问、每周召开一次工人座谈会、每天上午深入车间同工人研究解决问题等制度。
    这个厂的伙食办得不好是职工长期关心而没有彻底解决的一个问题。鸣放中，职工又提出：“伙食贵，油少，菜的花样少，味道不好。”以前，这个厂的领导人员对这个问题的看法是：油少，是整个供应计划的问题；伙食贵，兄弟厂也不便宜。这次，他们就不这样对待群众的意见了，而是认为这关系到全体职工每天的生活，应该赶快设法解决。他们便立即发动炊事员喂了八头猪，解决油和肉供应不足的问题；加强对炊事人员的政治思想工作，帮助他们想办法厉行节约，增加菜的品种，改善烹调方法；发动干部在业余时间开荒，种了一亩多地的青菜。职工们看到了整改的实际效果，一度消沉的大字报又琳琅满目了，一个群众性的整改高潮掀了起来。
    这个厂的领导人员为了依靠群众热情彻底整改，把原来认为最棘手的问题——工资问题和干部下放问题也交给群众讨论。经过群众讨论，这两个问题也顺利解决了。90％以上的干部都向领导申请下放，紧缩机构的方案正在顺利实施。
    到11月中旬，厂里能解决的问题已经解决了86％以上。为了使整改工作更加彻底，他们通过职工代表会组织了一个包括各方面人员的检查组，对已经解决的问题逐项进行了检查。结果肯定绝大部分问题解决得是妥善的，群众都表示满意。检查中也发现有四个问题能解决而没有解决，有六个问题的改进措施贯彻得不好，同时检查出了二十七个新问题，领导方面对这些问题又都作了处理。现在，这个厂对职工提出的正确的意见，已经全部处理完毕，并且真正做到了“事事有人管，条条有着落”。为了把这次整改的成果巩固下来，还制定了各种相应的制度。
    目前，这个厂里已经出现了一片新气象。厂级领导人员改变了凡事只靠车间和职能部门负责人汇报的作风，经常深入到车间或基层去了解情况。厂长张小海在染布车间发现硫化蓝布质量不好，立即召集生产工人开了两次座谈会，接受了工人提的四项建议，第二天的正品率就由90.3％上升到93％。领导人员对职工生活更加关心了。冬天到来以前，他们就责成总务部门为工人办好了床铺草。假日里，厂级领导人员都分头到工人家庭去探望，上下级之间已亲如家人。职工生产热情空前高涨。过去这个厂的产品质量很少达到国家指标，从10月份以来，质量都百分之百达到了要求。到11月20日止，今年全年的总产值计划已经完成了104.51％，利润计划完成了101.67％，成本比年计划降低了10.428％，还试制成功了十一种新产品。
