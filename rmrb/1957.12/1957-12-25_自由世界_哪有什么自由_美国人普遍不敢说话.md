Xinhua News Agency, New York, 24th: Leslie Moeller, head of the Journalism Department at Iowa State University in the United States, published an article in the bi-monthly "Vital Speeches of the Day" not long ago, pointing out that Americans are generally afraid to speak because they fear "investigations" by the FBI's secret agents.

He said: "We habitually describe the United States as a free country. But it is a country where that freedom is often hindered. The hindrance to freedom is now greater than in many years past, perhaps greater than at any time in the past. These hindrances are no longer just hindrances; some freedoms have disappeared, and the struggle to restore these freedoms is not progressing smoothly."

The author cited some examples of Americans being afraid to speak. A radio station in Salt Lake City conducted a survey a few years ago on the dismissal of MacArthur. Among those interviewed, 40% had opinions, but they dared not publicly express them. The reasons? "It's always right to be careful in what you say." "I don't know what 'others' think, so I don't want to say anything." "Someone will use this to harm me later." "I don't want the FBI to investigate me."

Moeller continued: When the "Times-Union" of Rochester (New York) investigated "whether the residents of Rochester believe that the taxes paid after the increase in taxes were exchanged for what they deserved," it found that many people were unwilling to speak. A reporter reported that she had to ask "dozens of people to get one answer that could be published." Hans Knight of the "Harrisburg Patriot-News" described the same situation. Mr. Knight wrote a two-column letter to "Editor & Publisher" on July 13, 1957, expressing some concern about freedom of speech, based on talking to two thousand people over two years to collect materials for a Sunday supplement; the name of this supplement had a certain irony—"The People Speak." What made him uneasy was that people were "afraid of their opinions being published."

Moeller also talked about the reasons why Americans are afraid to speak and afraid to join organizations. He said: "For example, the Attorney General drafts a list of so-called subversive organizations, but these organizations may not necessarily receive notice that they will be included in the list, and they are not given a chance to appeal before the list is published. As long as you participate in this kind of organization, whether actively or accidentally, intentionally or unintentionally, it is often regarded as evidence of subversive activities or intentions without in-depth investigation.

Moeller concluded that in today's American climate, people are often overly afraid to speak, afraid to tell the truth. "When we find that 40% of our citizens dare not even express an opinion when asked a question," what freedom is there to speak of?

### “自由世界”哪有什么自由  美国人普遍不敢说话

    “自由世界”哪有什么自由
    美国人普遍不敢说话
    据新华社24日讯　纽约消息：美国衣阿华州立大学新闻系主任莱斯利·莫勒不久以前在“当前重要演说”半月刊上发表一篇文章，指出美国人民由于害怕美国联邦调查局特务密探的“调查”，普遍地不敢讲话。
    他说：“我们习惯地把美国说成是一个自由的国家。但是它是那种自由经常受到妨碍的国家。现在自由受到的妨碍比过去许多年都大，也许比过去任何时期都大。这些妨碍已经不仅是妨碍了；某些自由已经消失了，而恢复这些自由的斗争进行得并不顺利。”
    作者举出了美国人不敢讲话的一些事例。盐湖城一家电台几年前就麦克阿瑟免职一事进行了一次调查。经过接谈的人中40％是有意见的，但是他们不敢公开发表自己的意见。理由是什么？“说话谨慎总不会有错。”“我还不知道‘别人’怎么想，因此我什么也不愿意说。”“以后会有人用这个来害我。”“我不想叫联邦调查局来调查我。”
    莫勒继续写道：罗彻斯特（纽约州）的“时代联合报”在调查“罗彻斯特的居民是不是认为增加赋税以后所交的税款换得了应得的东西”时，发现许多人都不肯说话。一位记者报道说，她必须问过“几十个人，才能得到一次可供发表的答复。”“哈里斯堡爱国新闻”的汉斯·奈特叙述了同样的情况。奈特先生1957年7月13日写给“编者与出版者”的一封占两栏篇幅的信里对言论自由表示有些担忧，他的根据是用两年的时间同两千个人谈过话，以便为一个星期日副刊搜集材料；这个副刊的名称带有某些讽刺意味——“人民的发言”。使他不安的是人们“害怕自己的言论被发表”。
    莫勒还谈到美国人民不敢讲话、不敢参加社团的原因。他说：“例如司法部长拟就一份所谓颠复性组织的名单，但这些组织并不一定能接到通知说它们将被列入名单之内，而名单发布以前并不给它们一次申诉的机会。只要参加了这种组织，不管积极或偶然，有意或无意，便不经深入调查而时常被看作有颠复性活动或意图的证据。
    莫勒最后说，在今天美国的气候下，人们时常过分地害怕发言，害怕说真心话。“当我们发现，在提出一个问题的时候，我国公民有40％连表示一下意见都不敢，”那还谈得上什么自由呢？
