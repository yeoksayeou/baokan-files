Xinhua News Agency, December 30th dispatch from Stockholm: According to TASS, the 18th Congress of the Swedish Communist Party opened in Stockholm on the 28th. This congress is being held on the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the Swedish Communist Party.
    More than 300 delegates attended the congress, along with many guests.
    Representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the Soviet Union, China, France, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Germany, and Albania attended the congress.
    The opening of the congress was presided over by Jonasson, a member of the Central Committee of the Swedish Communist Party and editor-in-chief of "New Daily." After the leadership of the congress was elected, Hagberg, Chairman of the Swedish Communist Party, gave a summary report on the work of the Swedish Communist Party in the period since the last congress.
    He spoke in detail about the work of the party, explained the party's tasks for the future, and analyzed the current international situation and Sweden's foreign and domestic policies. He focused on the issue of striving for peace.
    After Hagberg's report, the congress began to discuss his report.
    The head of the delegation of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union attending the congress, Mazurov, alternate member of the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee, delivered a congratulatory message to the congress on behalf of the CPSU Central Committee at the meeting on the 28th. He warmly congratulated the convening of the congress, saying that this congress is a major event in the life of the Swedish Party because it will summarize the long road traversed by the Swedish Communist Party in the forty years since its founding.
    He said: The Swedish Communist Party, on the basis of creatively applying Marxism-Leninism in combination with the conditions of its own country, has unswervingly struggled for the interests of the Swedish working class and all working people, for peace, democracy and social progress. The Swedish Communist Party has made significant contributions to defending the social and democratic rights of the Swedish working people in the daily struggle to improve the living conditions of the working class, to strive for their unity of action and to oppose the attacks of large monopoly capital.
    The Central Committee of the CPSU wishes the Swedish Communist Party success in resolving the tasks it faces and in further strengthening its ranks ideologically and organizationally, and, under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and the principles of proletarian internationalism, to continue tirelessly to fight for the cause of the working class, for peace and socialism.
    Mazurov's speech was interrupted more than once by warm applause from the entire audience. In his speech, he especially spoke about the relations between the Soviet Union and Sweden. He said that the Soviet Union and Sweden are neighboring countries, and we are very willing to maintain good-neighborly relations between the peoples of the two countries, which are built on the principle of peaceful coexistence in accordance with the vital interests of the two peoples. The Soviet people respect the peace-loving people of Sweden and are promoting the comprehensive development and strengthening of friendly and good-neighborly relations between our two peoples.
    Representatives of the fraternal Communist Parties of France, China and Italy also delivered congratulatory messages to the congress one after another, and were warmly welcomed by the congress.
    The congress announced that it had received congratulatory telegrams from fraternal parties in Japan, Indonesia, Switzerland and other countries.
    Xinhua News Agency, December 30th dispatch from Stockholm: Zeng Shan, representative of the Chinese Communist Party and member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, delivered a congratulatory message at the 18th Congress of the Swedish Communist Party. He also read out the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.
    Zeng Shan said that the Swedish working class is a fighting force with a long history of struggle and glorious revolutionary traditions. "The birth of the Swedish Communist Party in 1917 was a major turning point in the history of the Swedish workers' movement. It marked the Swedish workers' movement breaking free from the shackles of social reformism and opening up a path of Marxism-Leninism. For forty years, under the leadership of the Swedish Communist Party, the Swedish working class has waged unswerving, arduous and heroic struggles to strengthen and consolidate its ranks, to strengthen the domestic and international fighting unity of the working class, to safeguard the vital interests of the working people, to strive for social progress and to defend world peace. The path of struggle traversed by the Swedish Communist Party over the past forty years proves that the Swedish Communist Party has withstood various tests and has become the most resolute and most loyal defender of the interests of the Swedish working class and working people. The Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people are concerned about the struggle waged by the Swedish Communist Party and the Swedish working people, and sympathize with and support this struggle. We firmly believe that your struggle will achieve a great victory."
    Zeng Shan said: "We are particularly pleased to see that this congress of your party is being convened at a time when the development of the international situation has entered a new turning point that is favorable to socialism and opposes imperialism, and international unity of the communist movement has begun a new stage." "The balance of world forces has undergone a fundamental change. Now, the advantage is definitely not on the side of the imperialist aggressive forces, but on the side of the socialist, nationally independent and peaceful forces. However, on the other hand, it must be seen that the reactionary forces of imperialism will never withdraw from the stage of history automatically. At present, the reactionary forces headed by US imperialism are gathering the Atlantic Group countries, stepping up the arms race, attempting to establish US missile bases in Europe, carrying out new war provocations, and strengthening their conspiracies to oppose socialism, suppress national independence movements, and undermine world peace." Zeng Shan continued, in this situation, the Communist Party must further strengthen the unity within its own ranks, further strengthen the unity with all progressive and democratic forces, and further strengthen the unity between the working classes of the world, in order to defend and advance the cause of peace, democracy and socialism, so that the conspiracy activities of the imperialist reactionary forces cannot succeed.
    Zeng Shan said that the people of China and Sweden have traditional friendship. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, friendly exchanges between the peoples of the two countries have seen new growth and expansion. He expressed gratitude for the friendly attitude of the Swedish government and the Swedish people towards China, and even more gratitude to the Swedish Communist Party for its great efforts in promoting and strengthening the friendly relations between the two peoples. He said: "The sympathy and support of the Swedish Communist Party and the Swedish people for the Chinese people have given great encouragement to the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people who are striving to build socialism."
    Zeng Shan finally read out the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to the 18th Congress of the Swedish Communist Party. The full text of the congratulatory telegram is as follows:
        Congratulatory Telegram from the Central Committee of the CPC
    "To the 18th Congress of the Swedish Communist Party:
    The Communist Party of China extends warm and fraternal congratulations to the Congress.
    We are closely watching and concerned about the arduous struggle of the Swedish Communist Party for the past forty years. Your congress is being convened precisely at a time when the world political situation has entered a new turning point that is favorable to socialism, and the international unity of the communist movement has begun a new stage. We wish the Congress a complete success in holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism. We wish your party new progress in the cause of uniting the entire working class, uniting all democratic and progressive forces, and uniting all the people of Sweden, and new achievements in the struggle to safeguard the vital interests of the working masses, and to strive for peace, democracy and socialism.
                              Central Committee of the Communist Party of China"

    建党四十年一贯为工人阶级利益而斗争
    瑞典共产党第十八次代表大会开幕
    苏中法意等国兄弟党代表在会上致贺词
    据新华社30日讯　据塔斯社斯德哥尔摩讯：瑞典共产党第十八次代表大会28日在斯德哥尔摩开幕，这次代表大会是在瑞典共产党建党四十周年的时候举行的。
    参加代表大会的有三百多名代表，还有许多来宾。
    苏联、中国、法国、意大利、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、挪威、丹麦、芬兰、德国、阿尔巴尼亚等国共产党和工人党的代表参加了大会。
    代表大会由瑞典共产党中央委员、“新日报”总编辑约翰逊主持开幕。在选出代表大会的领导机构之后，瑞典共产党主席哈格堡作了关于瑞典共产党自从上次代表大会以来这一段时期内的工作总结报告。
    他详细谈到党的工作，说明了党在今后的任务，并且对当前的国际局势和瑞典的外交和内政政策作了分析。他着重谈到争取和平的问题。
    哈格堡报告结束后，大会开始讨论他的报告。
    出席这次大会的苏联共产党代表团团长、苏共中央主席团候补委员马祖罗夫在28日会议上代表苏共中央向大会致贺词。他热烈祝贺大会的召开，他说，这次代表大会是瑞典党生活中的一件大事，因为它将总结瑞典共产党在建党以来的四十年中所经历的漫长道路。
    他说：瑞典共产党在结合本国条件创造性地运用马克思—列宁主义学说的基础上，始终不渝地为争取瑞典工人阶级和全体劳动人民的利益、争取和平、民主和社会进步而斗争。瑞典共产党在争取改善工人阶级的生活条件、争取他们行动一致和反对大垄断资本的进攻的日常斗争，为保卫瑞典劳动人民的社会和民主权利作出了重大的贡献。
    苏共中央委员会祝瑞典共产党在解决它所面临的任务和进一步在思想上和组织上加强队伍方面取得成就，并且在马克思—列宁主义学说和无产阶级国际主义原则的指导下，不疲倦地继续为工人阶级的事业、为争取和平和社会主义而奋斗。
    马祖罗夫的讲话不止一次地为全场的热烈掌声所打断。他在讲话中特别讲到苏联和瑞典之间的关系。他说，苏联和瑞典两国是邻国，我们很愿意使两国人民之间保持睦邻关系，这个关系是在符合两国人民切身利益的和平共处原则的基础之上建立起来的。苏联人民很尊重瑞典的爱好和平的人民，并且正在促进我们两国人民之间友好的睦邻关系的全面发展和加强。
    法国、中国和意大利各兄弟共产党代表也先后向代表大会致贺词，受到大会热烈欢迎。
    大会宣布收到了日本、印度尼西亚、瑞士等兄弟党的贺电。
    新华社30日讯　斯德哥尔摩消息：中国共产党代表、中国共产党中央委员会委员曾山在瑞典共产党第十八次代表大会上致贺词。他并且宣读了中国共产党中央委员会的贺电。
    曾山说，瑞典工人阶级是有悠久的斗争历史和光荣的革命传统的一支战斗队伍。“瑞典共产党在1917年的诞生，是瑞典工人运动的历史的一个重大的转折点，它标志着瑞典工人运动打破了社会改良主义的束缚而开辟了一条马克思列宁主义的道路。四十年来，瑞典工人阶级在瑞典共产党的领导下，为着壮大和巩固自己的队伍、为着加强工人阶级国内和国际的战斗团结，为着维护劳动人民的切身利益、争取社会进步和保卫世界和平，进行了始终不渝的艰苦的英勇的斗争。四十年来，瑞典共产党走过的斗争道路证明，瑞典共产党经受了各种考验，已经成为瑞典工人阶级和劳动人民的利益的最坚决和最忠实的捍卫者。中国共产党和中国人民关注着瑞典共产党和瑞典劳动人民所进行的斗争，同情和支持这一斗争。我们坚决相信，你们的斗争必将达到伟大的胜利。”
    曾山说：“我们特别高兴地看到，你们党的这一次代表大会是在国际形势的发展已经进入了一个有利于社会主义和反对帝国主义的新的转折点，共产主义运动的国际团结开始了一个新阶段的时机召开的。”“世界力量的对比已经起了根本的变化。现在，优势已经肯定地不在帝国主义的侵略势力一边，而是在社会主义的、民族独立的和和平的力量的这一边了。但是，在另一方面，又必须看到，帝国主义的反动力量是绝不会自动退出历史舞台的。目前，以美帝国主义为首的反动力量就正在纠集大西洋集团国家，加紧军备竞赛，企图在欧洲建立美国的导弹基地，进行新的战争挑衅，加强反对社会主义、镇压民族独立运动和破坏世界和平的阴谋活动。”曾山接着说，在这种形势之下，共产党必须更加加强自己队伍内部的团结，更加加强同一切进步和民主力量的团结，更加加强全世界工人阶级之间的团结，以保卫和推进和平、民主和社会主义事业，使帝国主义反动力量的阴谋活动不能得逞。
    曾山说，中国和瑞典两国人民有传统的友谊。中华人民共和国成立以来，两国人民间的友好往来有了新的增长和扩大。他表示感谢瑞典政府和瑞典人民对中国的友好态度，更感谢瑞典共产党为促进和加强两国人民友好关系而作出的重大努力。他说：“瑞典共产党和瑞典人民对于中国人民的同情和支持，给了正在为建设社会主义而奋斗的中国共产党和中国人民以极大的鼓舞”。
    曾山最后宣读了中国共产党中央委员会给瑞典共产党第十八次代表大会的贺电。贺电全文如下：
        中共中央贺电
    “瑞典共产党第十八次代表大会：
    中国共产党谨向大会致以热烈的兄弟般的祝贺。
    我们亲切地注视和关怀瑞典共产党四十年来的艰苦斗争。你们这次大会的召开，正当世界政治形势进入了一个有利于社会主义的新转折点，共产主义运动的国际团结开始了一个新阶段的时候，我们预祝大会在高举马克思列宁主义的旗帜下获得圆满的成功。祝你们党在团结整个工人阶级、团结一切民主进步力量和瑞典全体人民的事业上，获得新的进展。祝你们的党和你们的人民在维护劳动群众的切身利益、争取和平、民主和社会主义事业的斗争中，获得新的成就。
                              中国共产党中央委员会”
