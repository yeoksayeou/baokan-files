Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 30th - Hubei Province's iron and wood handicraft cooperatives have successfully trial-produced more than 30 kinds of improved farm tools worthy of promotion, including major farm tools such as iron-toothed rollers and seed drills, as well as small, ingenious tools such as hillside plows and knife-edge harrows. Their efficiency is one to six times higher than that of old-fashioned farm tools. These improved farm tools have been repeatedly tested and evaluated by farmers and continuously improved, so they are fully applicable.

Currently, iron and wood handicrafts in various parts of the province are holding exhibitions to promote improved farm tools, inviting members of local agricultural cooperatives to visit, which are deeply welcomed by agricultural cooperatives. During the winter sowing period, iron and wood handicraft cooperatives throughout the province have supplied more than 10,000 improved seed drills.

　　湖北手工业社改良农具
    据新华社武汉30日电湖北省铁、木手工业社已试制成功三十多种值得推广的改良农具，其中包括铁錾滚、条播器等主要农具，山地犁、刀口耙等精巧灵便的小型农具等。它们的效率比旧式农具提高一倍到六倍。这些改良农具都曾交给农民反复试验、鉴定，不断改进，所以完全适用。
    目前，全省各地铁、木手工业正纷纷召开推广改良农具展览会，邀请当地农业社社员参观，深受农业社欢迎。在冬播期间，全省各地铁、木手工业社已供应改良农具条播器一万多部。
