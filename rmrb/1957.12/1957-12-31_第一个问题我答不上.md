    I Cannot Answer the First Question
    Lin Yin, Guangxi Teachers College
    In the article "The Revolutionary Examination" by Comrade Wen Qinggui, published in the "People's Daily" supplement on December 21st, three questions were posed to intellectual cadres: 1. Do you possess the feelings of workers and peasants? 2. Can you distinguish the five grains? 3. Can your shoulder carry and your hand lift? I can answer the latter two questions because I came from a peasant family and participated in productive labor. However, I cannot answer the first question.
    The reason is simple: after I started working, I became more and more estranged from the peasants.
    Before 1952, I got along well with the peasants. During the long periods of suppressing bandits, opposing local bullies, land reform, and land reform review, I lived in the homes of peasants for a long time, eating, living, and working with them. However, things changed greatly after I was transferred in 1952. When I returned to my hometown during the summer vacation, the villagers treated me as a "returning home in glory" "relative visiting," and my family also treated me as a "guest." Why? Upon examination, I found three reasons:
    First, I had the stinking airs of an intellectual. When I went home, I was always "neatly dressed," wearing socks and shoes in June, and leather boots in winter, with wide trousers covering my shoes; I smoked cigarettes, and when smoking, I didn't want to use wood chips to light them, but wanted to use matches; I walked with a refined manner, and when I walked into the crowd, I was like a "crane standing among chickens." Therefore, when I met villagers, if I didn't greet them first, they would pretend not to recognize me and walk past with their heads down.
    Second, I became a bit disgusted with the peasants being dirty, even my father, who was over fifty years old and still worked all year round, I also thought he was dirty and felt he was like a beggar, shameful.
    Third, the idea of pursuing comfort and pleasure gradually increased in my mind. When I was transferred, the government assigned me to work in the supply and marketing cooperative, but I was afraid of having to cross mountains and ridges to deliver goods, which would be too tiring, so I didn't want to go; I was also assigned to work in the district government, but I was afraid of going to engage in "three togethers" with the peasants again, so I declined. I insisted on going to school to be a teacher, thinking that being a teacher was easy and I could "avoid rain in spring, wind in autumn, sun in summer, and snow in winter."
    Because of these three reasons, I cannot answer Comrade Wen Qinggui's first question. I think, to answer this question, besides going back to the countryside to be a primary school student for a few years, there is no other way to pass the "exam."

    第一个问题我答不上
    广西师范学院　林荫
    12月21日“人民日报”副刊刊登的文庆归同志“革命的考试”一文中，对知识分子干部出了三个试题：1、你具备了工农的感情吗？2、你能分辨五谷吗？3、肩能挑，手能提吗？后两个题我能回答，因为我出身于农民家庭，参加过生产劳动。但是，第一个题我就答不上了。
    原因很简单，就是我参加工作以后，一天天的和农民疏远了。
    在1952年以前，我还是和农民很讲得来的。剿匪反霸土地改革，土改复查等漫长的时间中，长期住在农民家里，和他们同吃、同住、同劳动；然而自1952年转业之后，情况就大不同了。当我在暑期回乡的时候，乡亲们把我当成“衣锦还乡”的“探亲者”，家庭中也把我当了“客人”。原因呢？我检查起来有下面三个：
    第一，有了一付知识分子的臭架子。在回家的时候，总是“衣冠整齐”，六月套上鞋袜，冬天穿上皮靴，六寸宽的长裤脚扫着鞋面；抽的是香烟，而且在抽烟时不愿用木柴头点，而要划火柴；走起路来，文质彬彬，走到群众中，俨然是“鹤立鸡群”。因此碰上村邻，如果不是我先喊他们，他们也就会当不认识，低头走过。
  第二，我有点嫌农民脏了，甚至连我那五十多岁还要终年劳作的父亲，我也嫌他脏了，觉得他像叫化子一样，丢人。
    第三，在我的脑子里好逸恶劳的享乐思想逐渐多起来。转业的时候，政府分配我去供销社工作，我怕要跨山越岭，送货上门，太累，不愿去；又分配去区政府工作，我又怕再去和农民搞“三同”而谢绝。我坚持要到学校去当教师，认为当教师清闲，可以“春不受雨，秋不受风，夏不受日，冬不受雪”。
    由于有这三个原因，所以文庆归同志的第一道试题就无法回答了。我想，要回答这个问题，除了再去农村作几年小学生外，是别无他法可以考得“及格”的。
