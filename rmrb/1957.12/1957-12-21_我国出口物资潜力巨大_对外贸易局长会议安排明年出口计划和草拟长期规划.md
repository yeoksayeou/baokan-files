Xinhua News Agency, 20th: The Ministry of Foreign Trade recently convened a national foreign trade directors' meeting to arrange the 1958 foreign trade export plan and to preliminarily draft a long-term plan for export commodities during the Second Five-Year Plan period. Vice Chairman Zhu De and Vice Premier Chen Yi both attended the meeting and gave important instructions.

The meeting, based on the requirements of our country's Second Five-Year Plan and in coordination with the realization of the Agricultural Development Program, unanimously agreed that during the Second Five-Year Plan period, our country's foreign trade must be greatly developed. Foreign trade departments should import more raw materials and machinery and equipment needed for economic construction, as well as materials needed for people's lives.

During the discussion of the long-term plan for export commodities during the Second Five-Year Plan period, the meeting believed that because the development of agricultural production in our country lags behind the growth of industrial production and the needs of people's lives, the overall export commodity supply is relatively tight. However, it's not tight across the board. Materials vital to people's lives are relatively tight, while general materials are relatively loose; large cities and areas along transportation lines are relatively tight, while remote areas and mountainous regions are relatively loose. It must be recognized that our country has a vast territory, abundant resources, and a wide variety of agricultural, sideline, local, and special products. Therefore, the export potential is enormous. According to surveys, the total value of Sichuan Province's local and special products is 1.325 billion yuan per year, with mountainous areas accounting for 500 million yuan. Currently, only 186 million yuan are supplied for export, leaving a large export potential untapped. Other regions have similar situations. Therefore, in addition to the continued limited export of several major commodities closely related to people's food and clothing, various industrial products, mineral products, aquatic products, small local products, mountain goods, handicrafts, and other materials not closely related to people's lives must be vigorously organized for export. This will not only earn the import of important materials necessary for national production, construction, and market supply, but also play a major role in supporting industrial and agricultural production, increasing people's income, especially in enlivening the urban and rural economy, and supporting the development of the mountain economy.

During the discussion, the representatives from various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, adhering to the principles of building the country through diligence and frugality and striving for more, faster, better, and more economical results, demonstrated a pragmatic revolutionary spirit and put forward plans. The figures in these plans exceeded the draft figures submitted by the Ministry of Foreign Trade to the conference for discussion by tens of billions of yuan. The increased varieties included mineral products, local products, agricultural and sideline products, and food. The meeting, based on the spirit of being both active and reliable, and considering both foreign market capacity and domestic production conditions, arranged the 1958 export plan and preliminarily drafted a long-term plan for export commodities during the Second Five-Year Plan period.

The meeting required that the foreign trade bureaus of each province, city, and autonomous region, under the leadership of the local Party and government, should coordinate with relevant departments to specifically arrange production plans for export commodities, and, under the principle of overall consideration, correctly arrange the domestic and export sales ratio of these export commodities, and include the production and supply plans for export commodities as an integral part of the local national economic plan.

In order to develop the production of export commodities in a planned way, the meeting emphasized that the Ministry of Foreign Trade, various foreign trade specialized companies, and foreign trade organizations at various ports should closely liaise with the supplying departments, rely on grassroots cooperatives, organize forces to go to the mountains, the countryside, and into factories and mines, and strengthen procurement work. When organizing the production of export commodities, attention must be paid to improving quality, specifications, and packaging according to the needs of foreign markets, in order to facilitate foreign sales. To this end, foreign trade departments should regularly inform production departments of foreign requirements and opinions in this regard, so that production departments can improve the quality, specifications, and packaging of export commodities. The meeting required that after the export plan and long-term plan are determined, the production departments should guarantee production, the supplying departments should guarantee supply, and the purchasing departments should guarantee purchase. In order to support the development of export commodity production, in addition to mainly relying on central and local production departments for investment, foreign trade departments will also appropriately invest in adding some small processing plants and cold storage facilities directly related to export commodities, and implement the method of prepayment for certain export commodities that must be developed.

In view of the important role of foreign trade in national construction, and the fact that local foreign trade tasks are bound to increase greatly in the future, the meeting believed that the foreign trade organizations of each province, city, and autonomous region must continue to be strengthened, and thus it is very necessary to establish them independently, in order to take on the task of exploring the potential of export commodities, organizing new export varieties, especially going deep into mountainous areas to organize supply sources, and completing the state's foreign trade plan.

    我国出口物资潜力巨大
    对外贸易局长会议安排明年出口计划和草拟长期规划
    新华社20日讯  对外贸易部最近召开的全国对外贸易局长会议，安排了1958年对外贸易出口计划和初步拟订了第二个五年计划期间的出口货源长期规划草案。朱德副主席和陈毅副总理都到会上作了重要指示。
    会议根据我国第二个五年计划的要求，并配合农业发展纲要的实现，一致认为在第二个五年计划期间，我国对外贸易必须大大发展。对外贸易部门应该进口更多的经济建设所需的原材料和机械设备以及人民生活需要的物资。
    会议在讨论第二个五年计划期间出口货源长期规划时，认为由于我国农业生产的发展落后于工业生产和人民生活需要的增长，因此，总的来说，出口货源是比较紧张的。但不是一切都紧张，关系人民生活重大的物资较紧，一般物资较松；大城市和交通沿线较紧，偏僻地区和山区较松。必须看到我国幅员广阔，资源丰富，农副土特产品品种繁多，因此出口潜力是十分巨大的。据调查，四川省每年土特产总值十三亿二千五百万元，山区占五亿元，现在供应出口的仅一亿八千六百万元，还有很大的出口潜力没有发挥出来，其他地区也有类似情况。因之，除若干同人民吃、穿关系重大的主要商品必须继续限量出口外，各种工业品、矿产品、水产品、小土产、山货、手工艺品等与人民生活关系不大的物资，必须大力组织出口。这不仅能换取国家生产、建设和供应市场所必需的重要物资的进口，并且对扶植工农业生产，增加人民收入，特别是活跃城乡经济，支持山区经济的发展都将起重大的作用。
    在讨论中，各省、市、自治区到会代表本着勤俭建国和多、快、好、省的方针，发挥了实事求是的革命前进的精神，提出了规划，这些规划的数字突破了对外贸易部提交大会讨论的草案数字达数十亿元，增加的品种有：矿产品、土产品、农副产品和食品等。会议根据既要积极又要可靠的精神，结合国外市场容量和国内生产情况，安排了1958年出口计划和初步拟定了第二个五年计划期间出口货源长期规划草案。
    会议要求各省、市、自治区对外贸易局应在当地党政领导下，协同有关部门具体安排出口物资的生产规划，并且在统筹兼顾的原则下，正确安排这些出口物资的内外销比例，把出口物资的生产和供应规划列为地方国民经济规划的一个组成部分。
    为了有计划地发展出口商品生产，会议强调对外贸易部、各对外贸易专业公司和各口岸对外贸易机构要密切与供货部门的联系，依靠基层合作社，组织力量上山、下乡、深入厂矿，加强收购工作。在组织出口商品生产时，必须注意按照国外市场的需要，改进品质、规格、包装，以利对外推销。为此，对外贸易部门应该经常向生产部门介绍国外对这方面的要求和意见，以便生产部门改进出口商品的品质、规格和包装。会议要求在出口计划和长期规划确定以后，生产部门应作到包产，供货部门作到包供，收购部门作到包收。为了扶植出口商品生产的发展，除了主要依靠中央和地方主管生产部门进行投资外，对外贸易部门也将适当投资增设一些直接与出口物资有关的小型加工厂、冷藏设备，并且对某些必须发展的出口商品实行预付货款的办法。
    鉴于对外贸易对国家建设的重要作用，以及今后地方对外贸易任务势必大大增加的情况，会议认为各省、市、自治区对外贸易机构必须继续加强，因而单独设置很有必要，以便担负起发掘出口货源潜力，组织新的出口品种，特别是深入山区组织货源，完成国家的对外贸易计划的任务。
