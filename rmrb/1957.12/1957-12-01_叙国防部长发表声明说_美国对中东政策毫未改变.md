Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 30th - Newspapers here published a statement on the 29th by Syrian Defense Minister Azm, saying: "There is no indication that the United States will change its Middle East policy, not even the slightest possibility of such a change."

Referring to the visit of American Socialist Party leader Thomas, who left Syria on the 28th, Azm said: "The sole purpose of this American was to spread confusion and try to convince us that there is a possibility that the United States' policy towards Arab countries might change." Thomas arrived in Damascus on the 23rd.

Azm, who was recently appointed concurrently as Minister of Finance, pointed out in the statement that the United States' actions in the Middle East should be attributed to its imperialist policies. He said that the good relations between us and other countries should be based on the resolutions of the Bandung Conference and on the principle of eliminating imperialism. Azm asked: How can a policy of coexistence be compatible with a policy of imperialism?

Newspapers also reported that political figures here also believe that if the United States' claim to change its Middle East policy were true, then the Turkish and Israeli troop deployments would not have occurred. These people pointed out that Turkey and Israel are both servants of the United States, and they cannot survive without American aid. Their provocations cannot be carried out without the orders of their master, the United States.

The "Public Opinion" newspaper also pointed out in an editorial on the 29th that the so-called change in American policy is nothing more than a smokescreen. The newspaper said that the foundation of the United States' policy towards this region of the world lies in: implementing the "Eisenhower Doctrine" and fulfilling the Baghdad Pact, and further guaranteeing the existence of Israel, with the aim of eliminating Arab nationalism and free Arab countries. However, facts have proven that this policy was doomed to failure from the start.

### 叙国防部长发表声明说　美国对中东政策毫未改变

　  叙国防部长发表声明说
　　美国对中东政策毫未改变
    据新华社大马士革30日电　这里各报29日刊载的叙利亚国防部长阿泽姆的声明说：“没有任何迹象表明美国会改变它的中东政策，甚至连这种改变的可能性的迹象也没有”。
    阿泽姆谈到28日离开叙利亚的美国社会党领袖托马斯的访问时说：“这个美国人的唯一目的在于散布混乱，想使我们相信美国对阿拉伯国家的政策有可能改变。”托马斯是在23日到达大马士革的。
    新近被任命兼财政部长的阿泽姆在声明中指出，美国在中东所作所为，应该由美国的帝国主义政策来负责。他说，我们和其他国家之间的良好关系应该以万隆会议的决议为基础，也应该以消除帝国主义的主张为基础。阿泽姆问道：共处的政策怎么能够同帝国主义的政策互相符合呢？
    报纸还报道，这里的政界人士也认为，假如美国所说的打算改变对中东政策的话是实话，那么就根本不会发生土耳其和以色列集结军队的事。这些人士指出，土耳其和以色列都是美国的仆从，没有美国的援助它们就无法生存。它们进行挑衅，不可能不是奉了它们的主子美国的命令。
    “舆论报”29日在社论中也指出，某些人所说的美国政策的改变，无非是一种混淆视听的说法。这家报纸说，美国对世界这一地区的政策的基础在于：实现“艾森豪威尔主义”和履行巴格达条约并且进一步保障以色列的存在，以期消灭阿拉伯民族主义和自由的阿拉伯国家。但是，事实证明，这种政策从一开始就失败了。
