Xinhua News Agency, December 16th: The 141 cadres from Renmin University of China who were sent down to the Sino-Czech Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative in Beijing held a meeting on the 14th to summarize their gains since being sent down. Hu Xikui, Vice President of Renmin University of China, and many cadres from the university also attended the summary meeting. Zhai Liangchao, the leader of the sent-down cadres, Associate Professor of Renmin University of China, and Director of the Department of Economics, said at the meeting that the sent-down cadres had taken the first step on the road of labor training. He said that the biggest gain for the sent-down cadres during the month and a half of labor training was that everyone's class stance, ideology, mass viewpoint, and labor viewpoint had been initially trained and improved.

In the summary he made on behalf of all the sent-down cadres, Zhai Liangchao said: The sent-down cadres received realistic class education while living and working with rural residents. Once, a sent-down cadre made remarks at a debate that the rural population had fewer cloth coupons and that farmers' lives were not as good as workers', which was supported by a well-to-do middle peasant who opposed the policy of unified purchase and sale. However, the poor and lower-middle peasants present refuted this erroneous argument with the fact that cloth coupons were sufficient. Zhai Liangchao also said that the farmers' hardworking, simple, and thrifty qualities and their spirit of loving the cooperative as their home deeply moved the sent-down cadres. Many cooperative cadres and members dedicated all their energy to the cooperative.

Zhai Liangchao emphasized that labor training has brought new changes to the thinking and work style of the sent-down cadres. They put down the airs of intellectuals and lived and worked with the peasants. Many cadres carried manure baskets, and some cadres even carried urine buckets to collect urine fertilizer from each household every morning.

The 141 cadres from Renmin University of China were sent down to the Sino-Czech Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative on October 26th, including 36 Communist Party members and 59 Communist Youth League members; 105 associate professors, lecturers, teachers, and teaching assistants, accounting for 75% of all the sent-down cadres. They were all very active in labor. According to statistics, their average attendance rate was over 98%; in November, 130 people (the other 11 participated in the cooperative's long-term planning and other work) earned a total of more than 28,600 work points.

Hu Xikui, Vice President of Renmin University of China, congratulated the sent-down cadres on their achievements in labor training at the meeting. He said: The facts of more than a month have proved that the Party's policy of sending down cadres for labor training is correct, and everyone can become a working-class intellectual, but this is only the beginning. It is necessary to continue to carry out long-term and arduous training and strive to train oneself into a truly red and expert working-class intellectual who can withstand risks in a considerable period of time.

Zhang Tingliang, Secretary of the Zhang Guozhuang Township Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Guo Rong, Director of the Sino-Czech Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative, also spoke at the meeting.

　　在劳动中受到现实的阶级教育
    中国人民大学下放干部开会总结
    据新华社16日讯　中国人民大学下放到北京市中捷友好农业生产合作社的一百四十一个干部14日开会总结下放以来的收获。中国人民大学副校长胡锡奎和学校里的许多干部也来参加了总结会。下放干部的领队、中国人民大学副教授、经济系主任翟良超在会上说，下放干部在劳动锻炼的道路上已经迈进了第一步。他说，在一个半月的劳动锻炼中，下放干部最大的收获是大家的阶级立场、思想意识、群众观点和劳动观点都得到了初步的锻炼和提高。
    翟良超在代表全体下放干部所作的总结中说：下放干部在和农村居民一起生活、劳动中受到了现实的阶级教育。有一次，一个下放干部在辩论会上发表了农村人口的布票少、农民生活不如工人的言论，得到了反对统购统销政策的一个富裕中农的支持，但是到会的贫农、下中农都纷纷用布票够用的事实驳斥了这种错误的论调。翟良超又说，农民们勤劳、纯朴、节俭的品质和爱社如家的精神使下放干部深为感动。许多合作社的干部和社员把自己的全部精力都献给了合作社。
    翟良超着重谈到了劳动锻炼已经使下放干部的思想、作风起了新的变化，他们放下了知识分子的架子，和农民一起生活，共同劳动。不少干部背起了粪筐，有的干部还抬着尿桶每天早晨到各家去收集尿肥。
    中国人民大学一百四十一个干部是10月26日下放到中捷友好农业生产合作社的，其中共产党员三十六人，青年团员五十九人；副教授、讲师、教员和助教一百零五人，占全体下放干部的75％。他们在劳动中都很积极，据统计，他们出勤率平均在98％以上；11月份里一百三十人（其他十一人参加社内的远景规划等工作）共做了两万八千六百多个工分。
    中国人民大学副校长胡锡奎在会上祝贺下放干部在劳动锻炼中所取得的收获，他说：一个多月的事实证明，党的下放干部进行劳动锻炼的方针是正确的，大家是可能做一个工人阶级的知识分子的，但是这仅仅是开始，要继续进行长期的艰苦的锻炼，争取在相当长的时间内，把自己锻炼成一个真正经得起风险的又红又专的工人阶级知识分子。
    中共张郭庄乡委员会书记张廷亮、中捷友好农业生产合作社主任郭荣也在会上讲了话。
