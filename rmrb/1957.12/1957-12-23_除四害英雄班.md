    “Eradicate the Four Pests Hero Class”
    Students of Dongping Second Complete Primary School in Zhenlai County, Jilin Province, have always been active in patriotic health campaigns. In 1952, Class 3 of the fourth grade of the school won the honorary title of "Rodent-Catching Model Class" for catching nearly 3,000 rats. Since the launch of the winter rodent-catching campaign this year, the students of the school have achieved even greater results than in the past. Forty-two students in Class 3 of the sixth grade participated in the campaign, and in more than 20 days from the beginning of November to the end of the month, they collectively caught more than 38,000 rats and individually caught more than 2,000 rats, averaging more than 900 rats per person. Because Class 3 of the sixth grade achieved great results in catching rats, the students called them the "Eradicate the Four Pests Hero Class." (Zhang Yongfa)

    “除四害英雄班”
    吉林省镇赉县东屏二完小同学，对爱国卫生工作一向积极。1952年，该校四年级三班因捕获老鼠近三千只，曾获得全县捕鼠模范班的光荣称号。今年开展冬季捕鼠运动以来，该校同学又获得比过去更大的成绩。六年级三班四十二人参加运动，从11月初起到月底止的二十多天中，就集体捕鼠三万八千多只，个人捕鼠二千多只，平均每人捕鼠九百多只。因为六年级三班捕鼠成绩大，同学们都称他们为“除四害英雄班”。  （张永发）
