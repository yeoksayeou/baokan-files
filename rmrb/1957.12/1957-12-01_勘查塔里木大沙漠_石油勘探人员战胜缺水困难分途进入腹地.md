Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 30th: Petroleum exploration personnel recently entered the hinterland of the Taklamakan Desert in the Tarim Basin of Xinjiang successfully from three directions, embarking on geological surveys and gravity and magnetic prospecting.

The Taklamakan Desert is located in southern Xinjiang, stretching 1,100 kilometers from east to west and approximately 500 kilometers from north to south. Geologically, it is a blank spot.

Before the exploration team entered the desert, a lightly equipped reconnaissance team was dispatched in early August to scout the desert's natural geography, climate, and water sources. This reconnaissance team ventured into the edge of the desert twice, but was forced to retreat after exhausting the drinking water carried by camels, as they failed to find a water source. Later, setting out from Bachu County, they endured more than twenty days of arduous desert life and finally successfully crossed the Taklamakan Desert, completing their reconnaissance mission. During these twenty-plus days, the reconnaissance personnel drank only one teacup of water per person per day according to a fixed ration, and the camels drank water only once a week. While advancing arduously in the desert, they searched for water sources and recorded geological conditions. In the course of their reconnaissance, they found groundwater in several places.

After the reconnaissance team successfully completed its mission, exploration team personnel entered the desert from Bachu, Hotan, and other places in early October. Recently, they have all successfully reached the worksite. Geologists from an integrated team have already discovered outcrops of old Tertiary strata in the western part of the desert. This is of great significance for the geological interpretation of the Taklamakan.

### 勘查塔里木大沙漠  石油勘探人员战胜缺水困难分途进入腹地

　　勘查塔里木大沙漠
    石油勘探人员战胜缺水困难分途进入腹地
    据新华社乌鲁木齐30日电　石油勘探人员最近从三面分途顺利地进入新疆塔里木盆地塔克拉玛干大沙漠的腹地，展开地质调查和重力、磁力勘探工作。
    塔里木大沙漠位于新疆南部，东西为一千一百公里，南北约五百公里，是地质上的一个空白点。
    在勘探队进入沙漠以前，8月初曾派出一支轻装踏勘组侦察沙漠内的自然地理、气候和水源情况。这支轻装踏勘组两次深入沙漠边缘，在用完骆驼驮的饮水以后因未找到水源而被迫退出。后来，他们从巴楚县境出发，经历了二十多天艰苦的沙漠生活，终于顺利地穿过塔克拉玛干大沙漠，完成了踏勘任务。在这二十多天中，踏勘人员每天每人按定量只喝一茶缸水、骆驼每周喝一次水。他们一面艰难地在沙漠里前进，一面找寻水源，记载地质情况，在踏勘过程中他们在几处地方找到了地下水。
    在轻装踏勘组顺利地完成了踏勘任务以后，勘探队人员在10月初分别由巴楚、和阗等地进入沙漠。最近他们都已经顺利地到达工地。一个综合小组的地质人员已在沙漠的西部发现了老第三纪地层的露头。这对塔克拉玛干的地质解释有很重要的意义。
