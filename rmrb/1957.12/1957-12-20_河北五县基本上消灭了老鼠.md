　　Five counties in Ba Shang (Zhangbei, Kangbao, Shangdu, Guyuan, Shangyi) in Hebei Province have implemented large-scale measures to poison domestic and wild rats repeatedly over the past two years, eliminating approximately 90% of the wild rats on nearly all cultivated land and grasslands near cultivated land, and around villages, totaling about 10 million mu (667,000 hectares) of land. They completed the task of basically eliminating wild rats in all areas of the five counties (excluding the large grasslands). They also eliminated 70% to 90% of domestic rats in approximately 410,000 houses in all villages and towns in the five counties, creating many basically rat-free villages and towns, powerfully supporting the increase in agricultural production, and greatly reducing the threat of plague.
　　The five counties of Ba Shang are located in a plateau area at an altitude of 1,500 meters. It borders the large grasslands of Xilin Gol League and Chahar League in Inner Mongolia to the north, and has a large number of uncultivated grasslands within its borders, which are suitable areas for rodent reproduction. According to investigations over the past eight years, a total of twelve species of rats in six families have been discovered. The more numerous and common ones are the brown rat, yellow rat, striped field mouse, and narrow-skulled vole. According to surveys, the density of wild rats in the grassland is approximately 19.1 active burrows per hectare, and 5.4 active burrows per hectare in cultivated land. According to a rough survey of grassroots cadres in 29 townships in Shangyi, Zhangbei and other counties before the poisoning, the density of domestic rats was 72.5 active burrows per 100 houses (each house being 10 square meters).
　　Since the Central Government called for the elimination of the four pests, in order to eliminate the threat of plague in Ba Shang and support the agricultural bumper harvest campaign, the five counties in Ba Shang, under the leadership and strong support of Party committees and governments at all levels, made full use of the favorable conditions of agricultural cooperativization and the strength of mass organizations such as the Communist Youth League and the Women's Federation to launch the work of poisoning domestic and wild rats. The Hebei Provincial Plague Prevention Station learned from the experience of Jilin and Inner Mongolia in using white arsenic to poison wild rats, and successively implemented two or three rounds of blitzkrieg poisoning with white arsenic bait in April 1956 and April 1957 on nearly all cultivated land and grasslands within half a kilometer of cultivated land, and around villages within one kilometer, totaling about 10 million mu of land. The poisoned bait used was a mixture of one part white arsenic to ten parts boiled naked oats. Thirty to forty grains were placed in each rat burrow.
　　After repeated poisoning over the past two years, the density of wild rats on cultivated land in Ba Shang has decreased from 5.4 active burrows per hectare to 0.09; the density of wild rats on grasslands has decreased from 19.1 per hectare to 1.85. According to investigations conducted in June and July this year in thirteen villages and fourteen points in Zhangbei and Kangbao counties, covering 42 hectares of land, using water irrigation and shovel digging methods, no wild rats were found in the cultivated land, and only 0.2 wild rats per hectare were found in the grassland near the cultivated land, basically eliminating wild rats in the cultivated land and the surrounding grassland.
　　In the autumn of 1956, more than 404,000 houses and more than 690,000 rat holes in all villages and towns in the five counties of Ba Shang also underwent three to five rounds of poisoning of domestic rats. The poisoned baits used were fried noodle pellets containing 1% zinc phosphide and fried noodle pellets containing 0.5% antu, each pellet weighing one gram, with three pellets placed in each rat burrow without blocking the burrow. Bait was laid approximately every ten days, with zinc phosphide and antu used alternately. According to statistics from two counties, after baiting, a total of about 100,000 dead rats were found outside the burrows, and active burrows decreased by 65% to 90%.
　　In 1957, the five counties in Ba Shang switched to using fish meal-dipped noodle pellets containing 0.5% to 1% antu and 1% to 3% zinc phosphide to poison domestic rats. The results of key experiments showed that the effect was better than fried noodle pellets. According to surveys in eleven villages in Zhangbei, Guyuan, Kangbao and other counties, the number of rat burrows has now been reduced to 0.75 to 8.44 active burrows per 100 houses. They plan to vigorously poison rats this autumn and winter to basically eliminate domestic rats in the five counties.

　　河北五县基本上消灭了老鼠
    本报讯　河北省坝上五县（张北、康保、商都、沽源、尚义）两年来，反复实施了多次大规模的毒杀家鼠野鼠措施，消灭了接近全部耕地和耕地附近草原、村周围约一千万亩（六十六点七万公顷）土地上的野鼠的90％，完成了基本消灭五个县（除大草原以外）全部地区野鼠的任务。消灭了五个县全部村庄城镇共约四十一万间房屋的家鼠的70％到90％，创造了许多基本无鼠村镇，有力地支持了农业的增产，并大大减少了鼠疫的威胁。
    坝上五县为海拔一千五百公尺的高原地区。它北面和内蒙古锡林郭勒盟、察哈尔盟的大草原相接壤，境内有大量还没有开垦的草原，这是适宜于啮齿动物繁衍的地区。据八年来的调查共发现有六科十二种鼠，数量较多而又常见的有褐家鼠、黄鼠、棒杆鼷鼠、狭颅小田鼠等。据调查，草原野鼠密度大约是每公顷十九点一个盗开洞，已耕地每公顷五点四个盗开洞。家鼠密度据毒杀前尚义、张北等县二十九个乡基层干部粗略调查，每一百间房屋（每间十平方公尺）有七十二点五个盗开洞。
    自从中央号召除四害以后，为了消灭坝上鼠疫的威胁和支援农业丰产运动，坝上五县在各级党政的领导和大力支持下，充分利用了农业合作化的有利条件和共青团、妇联等群众团体的力量，展开了毒杀家鼠野鼠的工作。河北省鼠疫防治站学习了吉林、内蒙古使用白砒毒杀野鼠的经验，先后在1956年4月和1957年4月，在坝上五县接近全部耕地和耕地一华里以内的草原，半华里以外的村周共约一千万亩的土地上，实施了两三次白砒毒饵突击投药，使用的毒饵是一比十白砒煮莜麦。每个鼠洞放三四十粒。
    经过两年来的反复毒杀，坝上耕地上的野鼠密度，由每公顷五点四个盗开洞减少至零点零九个；草原上的野鼠密度由每公顷十九点一个减少到一点八五个。据今年6、7月在张北、康保两县十三个村十四个点四十二公顷土地上用水灌和锹挖方法的调查，耕地里面没有发现野鼠，耕地附近草原每公顷只有零点二只，基本上消灭了耕地和耕地附近的野鼠。
    1956年秋季，坝上五县的全部村庄城镇共四十万四千多间房屋，六十九万多个鼠洞也进行了三到五次毒杀家鼠投药。使用的毒饵是含1％磷化锌的油炒面丸和含0.5％安妥的油炒面丸，每丸重一克，每个鼠洞投三粒，不堵洞，每隔十天左右投饵一次，磷化锌同安妥交叉使用。据两个县的统计，投药以后，一共发现洞外死鼠约十万只，盗开洞减少65％至90％。
    1957年坝上五县改用含0.5％至1％安妥和含1％至3％磷化锌的鱼粉蘸面丸毒杀家鼠。重点试验的结果效果比油炸面丸好。据张北、沽源、康保等县的十一个村庄调查，目前鼠洞已经减少到每百间房屋零点七五到八点四四个盗开洞。他们计划通过今年秋冬大力毒杀，基本上消灭五个县的家鼠。
