Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 23rd: According to TASS, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, received the Editor-in-Chief of the British "Daily Express," Mr. Pickering, and the journalist accompanying him, Mr. Lancaster, on December 19th at their request. He held talks with them and answered some of their questions regarding Soviet-British relations and international issues.

Pickering said that according to preliminary news from the Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council, Western countries may resume negotiations with the Soviet Union. He asked Khrushchev: If negotiations can be realized in the near future, what do you think the outcome of the negotiations will be?

Khrushchev replied that we have spoken more than once about the necessity of negotiations, because the current international relations, including international relations in Europe, are not satisfactory. We have said more than once that all disputes must be resolved through negotiation. We are always ready to do so. However, negotiations can only achieve good results if Western countries, in the negotiations, must start from recognizing the necessity of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems, start from recognizing the status quo, and must strive to end the "Cold War" and ease international tensions.

Khrushchev said that we know that there are still people in the West who insist that it is impossible to reach an agreement with Soviet representatives, or even to trust them at all. Frankly speaking, those who say such things are simply unwilling to negotiate with us. These people will try to force us to make certain political concessions during negotiations, and their so-called political concessions simply mean eliminating the Soviet system in the Soviet Union and eliminating the socio-economic achievements of the people's democratic countries, whose people are building their lives on the basis of socialism. Of course, negotiations will not succeed that way. If the representatives of Western countries are wise enough not to make such demands, if they start from recognizing the necessity of peaceful coexistence and recognizing the status quo, then there is no reason to prevent negotiations from achieving positive results.

Pickering said that there are indications that some people in Britain are recently willing to consider the issue of neutralizing and denuclearizing the whole of Germany in Europe. He asked Khrushchev whether he thought this was a promising path for Soviet-British research.

Khrushchev said that we believe that the realization of such a desire would be beneficial to the people of all European countries. The Soviet Union will be happy to participate in the satisfactory resolution of this issue.

When discussing the issue of Soviet-British relations, Pickering said that Khrushchev had stated several times that it seemed that relations between Britain and the Soviet Union would improve in the coming years. He asked the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: Has the progress made in this regard disappointed you? What measures do you think the British government can take to promote the improvement of relations between the two countries?

Khrushchev said that I can say that there is no feeling of disappointment, but there is no particular pleasure either. The issue of improving Soviet-British relations is now in a state of stagnation. I think this is caused by some man-made reasons. The Soviet people and government, as well as the British people, are committed to establishing trust and friendly relations between our two countries. I think the British government also realizes the necessity of improving our mutual relations. We also believe that the difficulties that currently prevent the British government from taking more decisive steps in this regard will eventually be overcome. The interests of our two countries, the interests of our two peoples, require getting closer and being friendly with each other.

Regarding the ways to improve Soviet-British relations, Khrushchev said that the main way in this regard is to develop trade. We are happy to do so. We can be a profitable partner for you in trade. Our country can buy many industrial products made very well by the British. Britain can also buy the industrial products it needs from us. It is important that it can purchase raw materials from us, because its economy relies on foreign raw materials. Therefore, we can effectively and mutually beneficially develop our relations and strengthen the friendship between our two countries.

However, to develop British-Soviet trade, restrictions and discrimination must be eliminated. If someone tells us: This can be bought, that cannot be bought, then this situation deeply offends us, so that we sometimes deliberately do not buy things that we could have bought under normal conditions. Our people have their own sense of pride, and we do not want to be servile.

In addition, some people say that it is impossible to have free trade with the Soviet Union, because it is said that certain secrets of the Soviet Union's defense industry cannot be disclosed, and so-called "strategic" goods cannot be sold to it. However, such arguments are untenable, because precisely in the development of our defense industry, we may not need to import goods from Western countries. Although the Americans, with the help of the British, were the first to build the atomic bomb, the Soviet Union produced the hydrogen bomb before the Americans. The Soviet Union was the first to build intercontinental ballistic missiles before Western countries, and we were the first to launch artificial Earth satellites before other countries. This shows that our scientific and technological level is very high, no less than that of Britain or the United States, for example.

Therefore, the view that "strategic" goods cannot be sold to the Soviet Union based on security considerations is completely unfounded.

Pickering said that the development speed of British-Soviet trade has greatly disappointed the British public. We hope to develop this trade faster. In conversations with British government officials and business people, I personally felt that they seemed to think that the Soviet side was not very enthusiastic about this matter. Therefore, he asked: "Is the existence of discrimination the only obstacle to the widespread development of British-Soviet trade?"

Khrushchev said, yes, I think that is the only obstacle. I know that British business people are very willing to do business with us. But British government officials are using certain administrative measures to suppress their desire to trade with us. Thus, a situation is formed: industrialists and business people hope to trade with the Soviet Union, but your government is apparently bound by the common agreement involving all members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Your government, in following this agreement, sacrifices the interests of national industry and disregards the interests of the British people.

Pickering said that Khrushchev had said in a recent conversation that the Soviet Union plans to catch up with the living standards of the United States in about fifteen years. He asked Khrushchev, when will the Soviet Union catch up with the living standards of Britain?

Khrushchev said that we believe that among all capitalist countries, the United States has reached the highest level of production, whether in terms of total output or per capita output. Therefore, we have set ourselves the task of using the superiority of the socialist system to catch up with and surpass the country with the highest level of production—the United States.

However, I do not have the necessary materials on hand to compare the Soviet production level with the British production level, and I also admit that I have not considered when and in which products our country will catch up with Britain.

Khrushchev then said to Pickering that the Soviet Union has long surpassed Britain in the total production of many products, even it can be said most products. Britain is higher than the Soviet Union in terms of the per capita production and consumption level of certain products, but it is lower than the United States. The Soviet Union will catch up with Britain in this regard first, and then catch up with the United States. As for the total production, then I say again that the level of Britain is already a thing of the past for us.

Khrushchev pointed out that when comparing the production and consumption levels of the Soviet Union and Britain, the following situation must be taken into account: a large part of the industrial goods produced in Britain (and the United States is the same, only to a lesser extent) are exported to other countries, and residents of the country can only consume a part of the goods produced. Therefore, the per capita production level of industrial goods in the United States and Britain is usually much higher than the per capita consumption level. In addition, it should also be taken into account that the capitalist system in Britain, the United States and other capitalist countries makes the distribution of products, that is, the consumption of products, very uneven, that is to say, the living standards of people with high incomes and people with low incomes are very different. There is no such phenomenon under the socialist system. Our system guarantees a considerable degree of balance in the living standards of all the people.

Pickering asked Khrushchev if he agreed that Britain must maintain its strength and must possess the most modern weapons for its defense.

Khrushchev said that every country has the right to be concerned about its own security and defense. Like all other countries, highly developed Britain also has the right to do so. However, whether a country is great now depends less on the size of its strength and the number of its weapons than it does on the development of its economy and the development of culture and science. Therefore, a competition in developing a peaceful economy is more beneficial and safer. The more weapons a country accumulates, the less willing other countries will be to lag behind in the arms race. The arms race can only deplete the economy and can also lead to military conflicts that may have fatal consequences.

Pickering asked Khrushchev what he thought of the prospects for the cause of peace now? On this issue, is he an optimist or a pessimist?

Khrushchev said that I have never considered myself a pessimist. We have always been optimists, and now we are looking forward to the future with even greater optimism, because we believe that reason and healthy thinking will surely prevail.

He said that all signs now indicate that the prospects for the cause of peace have improved. Even some prime ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states had to talk about peace when speaking at the Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council, and some of them used to advocate the threat of war. If the people of all countries can fight for peace more persistently, if they exert greater pressure on those government leaders and politicians who are unwilling to implement peaceful coexistence, then peace can be guaranteed. In addition, an important fact in the current international situation should also be mentioned. That is: the balance of power between capitalist countries and socialist countries is changing in favor of socialist countries. And socialist countries have never intended to wage aggressive wars. On the contrary, they always do everything possible to ensure the peaceful coexistence between countries. This also shows that the prospects for the cause of peace are good.

The vast majority of people in capitalist countries advocate peace. It can be said that the tendency to advocate peaceful coexistence and to resolve disputes through negotiations on the basis of equality and mutual benefit is strengthening in international relations now.

It is precisely because of this that we are optimistic about the prospects for the cause of peace.

Finally, Khrushchev asked the British news reporter to convey to the British people through their newspaper that the Soviet Union has neither intended to invade Britain nor intended to invade other countries in the past or now. The Soviet Union is willing to live in peace and friendship with Britain and all other countries.

Khrushchev said again when saying goodbye: We are waiting for the British Prime Minister to visit the Soviet Union. We were guests of the British government last year. I think we will treat him with the same hospitality.

Pickering said that the British Prime Minister will read Khrushchev's words in the "Daily Express."

    答英国“每日快报”主编问
    赫鲁晓夫谈东西方谈判  西方国家必须从承认现状出发
    和平事业的前景已有了改善  主张和平共处的倾向在加强
    据新华社24日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科23日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫12月19日应英国“每日快报”主编皮克林的请求接见了他和随同他的记者兰克斯特，并且同他们进行了谈话，回答了他们提出的一些关于苏英关系的问题和一些国际问题。
    皮克林说，据有关北大西洋公约组织理事会巴黎会议的初步消息透露，西方国家有可能重新同苏联举行谈判。他问赫鲁晓夫：如果谈判能够在不久的将来实现，您认为谈判的结果将会如何？
    赫鲁晓夫答道，我们曾不止一次地谈到谈判的必要性，因为目前的国际关系，其中包括欧洲的国际关系，是不能令人满意的。我们不止一次地说过，一切争执问题必须用谈判的方式解决。我们这方面随时准备这样做。然而谈判只有在这样一种情况下才能获得良好的结果，那就是：西方国家在谈判时必须从承认不同社会制度的国家和平共处的必要性出发，从承认现状出发，并且必须努力结束“冷战”和缓和国际局势。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们知道，在西方还有人硬说，不可能同苏联代表达成协议，甚至根本不能相信苏联代表。老实说，说这种话的人根本不愿意同我们商谈。这些人在谈判时将力图使我们作出某些政治让步，而他们的所谓政治让步简直就是消灭苏联的苏维埃制度，消灭人民民主国家的社会经济成果，而这些国家的人民正是在社会主义的基础上建立他们的生活。这样，谈判当然不会成功。如果西方国家的代表十分明智而不提出这种要求，如果他们从承认必须和平共处出发、从承认现状出发，那么就没有什么理由会妨碍谈判达到积极效果。
    皮克林说，有迹象说明，近来在英国有人愿意考虑在欧洲使整个德国中立化和成为无原子武器地区的问题。他问赫鲁晓夫是否认为这是苏英两国可以加以研究的很有希望的途径？
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们认为，实现这样的愿望对于欧洲各国人民是有好处的。苏联将乐意参予圆满解决这个问题。
    在谈到苏英关系问题的时候，皮克林说，赫鲁晓夫曾经几次表示，仿佛在今后一些年里英国和苏联的关系将有改善。他问苏共中央第一书记：在这方面已经取得的结果是否使你感到失望？你认为，英国政府采取怎样的措施才能促成两国关系的改善？
    赫鲁晓夫说，我可以讲失望的情绪是没有的，但是也没有感到特别愉快。改善苏英两国关系的问题现在处于某种停滞的状态。我认为，这是由于某些人为的原因而引起的。苏联人民和政府以及英国人民都致力于在我们两国之间建立信任和友好的关系。我认为，英国政府也意识到必须改善我们两国的相互关系。我们也相信，目前显然还妨碍英国政府在这方面采取更果断的步骤的那些困难最后必将克服。我们两国的利益，我们两国人民的利益要求彼此接近和友好。
    关于改善苏英关系的途径，赫鲁晓夫说，这方面的主要途径是发展贸易。我们这方面将乐意这样做。我们能够成为你们在贸易中的有利的伙伴。我国可以向你们购买英国人制造得很好的许多工业品。英国也可以向我们购买它所需要的工业品。重要的是，它能够向我们采购原料，因为它的经济依靠着外来的原料。因此，我们可以有效而互利地发展我们的关系，加强我们两国之间的友谊。
    然而，要发展英苏贸易，就要取消限制和歧视。如果有人对我们说：这个可以买，那个不可以买，那末，这种情况深深触怒我们，以致在正常的条件下本来可能买的东西，有时我们也故意不买了。我国人民有自己的自豪感，我们不愿意卑躬屈膝。
    此外，有人说，同苏联不可能进行自由贸易，因为据说，不能对苏联公开国防工业的某些秘密，不能卖给它所谓“战略”商品。然而，这样的论据是站不住脚的，因为正是在发展我们的国防工业方面，我们未必需要从西方国家输入商品。虽然美国人得到英国人的帮助第一个制造出原子弹，但是苏联制造出氢弹是先于美国的。苏联先于西方国家第一个制造出洲际弹道火箭，我们先于其他国家第一个发射了人造地球卫星。这说明我们的科学技术水平很高，决不低于例如英国或美国。
    因此，认为基于安全的考虑而不能把“战略”商品售给苏联的这种看法是完全没有根据的。
    皮克林说，英苏贸易的发展速度使英国公众大为失望。我们希望更快地发展这种贸易。在同英国政府人士和商界人士交谈中，我亲身体会到，他们认为似乎苏联方面对这件事热情不大。因此，他问道：“歧视的存在是不是英苏贸易广泛发展的唯一障碍？”
    赫鲁晓夫说，是的，我认为这是唯一的障碍。我知道，英国商界人士很愿意同我们做生意。但是英国政府人士却利用某些行政措施来压制他们想同我们贸易的愿望。于是就形成这样一种情况：工业家、商界人士希望同苏联贸易，而贵国政府却显然被涉及北大西洋公约组织所有成员国的共同协定束缚住了手脚。遵循这个协定的贵国政府牺牲了民族工业的利益，置英国人民的利益于不顾。
    皮克林说，赫鲁晓夫在不久前的谈话中曾经说过，苏联计划在大约十五年内赶上美国的生活水平。他问赫鲁晓夫，苏联大约在什么时候赶上英国的生活水平？
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们认为在所有的资本主义国家中，不论是就总产量来说，或者是按人口计算的产量来说，美国都达到了最高的生产水平。因此，我们为自己规定了任务，要运用社会主义制度的优越性，赶上和超过具有最高生产水平的国家——美国。
    但是，现在我手头没有苏联生产水平同英国生产水平对比的必要材料，而且我也承认，我没有考虑过在什么时候和在那些产品上我们国家会赶上英国。
    赫鲁晓夫接着对皮克林说，苏联在许多产品甚至可以说是大多数产品的总生产量方面早已超过了英国。在按人口计算的某些产品的生产和消费水平方面英国是比苏联高，但是比美国低。苏联将在这一方面先赶上英国，然后赶上美国。至于谈到总生产，那么我再说一遍，英国的水平对我们说来早已是过去的事情了。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，在比较苏英两国的生产水平和消费水平时必须考虑到下面的情况，这就是，由于英国（美国情况也一样，只不过程度上较轻一些）有很大一部分生产出来的工业商品要输出到其他国家去，而本国居民只能消费一部分生产出来的商品。因此，在美国和英国按人口计算的工业商品的生产水平通常总是远远高于按人口计算的消费水平。此外还应该考虑到，英国、美国和其他资本主义国家的资本主义制度使得生产品的分配、即生产品的消费很不平均，也就是说收入高的人和收入低的人的生活水平悬殊极大。在社会主义制度下没有这种现象。我们的制度保证全体人民的生活水平在相当大程度上的平衡。
    皮克林问赫鲁晓夫，他是否同意英国必须保持实力、必须为自己的国防而掌握最现代化的武器这一点。
    赫鲁晓夫说，每一个国家都有权关心本国的安全和国防。像其他一切国家一样，高度发达的英国也有权这样做。但是，现在一个国家是否伟大，与其说是取决于实力的大小和武器的多少，倒不如说主要取决于经济的发展和文化科学的发展。因此，发展和平经济方面的竞赛，要有益些和安全些。一个国家积累的武器越多，其他国家也就越不甘心在军备竞赛上落后。军备竞赛只能耗竭经济，并且还会导致可能有致命后果的军事冲突。
    皮克林问赫鲁晓夫，他认为现在和平事业的前景如何？在这个问题上，他是乐观主义者，还是悲观主义者？
    赫鲁晓夫说，我从来没有认为自己是悲观主义者。我们一直是乐观主义者，而现在我们是更加乐观地展望着未来，因为我们相信：理智和健康思想一定胜利。
    他说，现在一切迹象都说明，和平事业的前景有了改善。甚至某些北大西洋公约成员国的总理在北大西洋公约组织理事会巴黎会议上发言时，也不得不说到和平，而其中某些人过去是主张战争威胁的。如果各国人民能更加坚忍不拔地为和平而斗争，如果他们对那些不愿意实行和平共处的政府领导人和政治家施加更大的压力，那么和平是可以得到保证的。此外，还应该提到当前国际局势中一个重要事实。这就是：资本主义国家和社会主义国家间的力量对比正在发生有利于社会主义国家的变化。而社会主义国家从来没有打算进行侵略战争。恰恰相反，它们总是尽一切可能来保证各国之间的和平共处。这一点也说明，和平事业的前景是不错的。
    资本主义国家的绝大多数人都主张和平。可以说，现在国际关系中，主张和平共处以及在平等互利的基础上用谈判解决争端问题的倾向加强了。
    正因为如此，我们对和平事业的前景抱着乐观的态度。
    最后，赫鲁晓夫请英国新闻记者通过他们的报纸转告英国人民，苏联过去和现在既没有侵略英国的意图，也没有侵略其他国家的打算。苏联愿意同英国以及所有其他国家和平友好地相处。
    赫鲁晓夫在告别的时候又说：我们等待英国的首相光临苏联。我们去年曾在英国政府那儿作客。我想，我们也将同样地殷勤地款待他。
    皮克林说，英国首相将在“每日快报”上读到赫鲁晓夫的话。
