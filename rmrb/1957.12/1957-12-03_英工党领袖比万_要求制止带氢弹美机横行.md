Xinhua News Agency, London dispatch from TASS: Prominent British Labour Party activist Bevan has demanded a halt to flights of planes carrying hydrogen bombs over Britain and Western Europe. In the "World News" newspaper, Bevan pointed out that if a plane taking off from a British or any other Western base were to drop a hydrogen bomb, it would "determine the fate of the British people," because the Soviet Union, in order to retaliate, would inevitably "encircle all bases capable of attacking it."

Bevan emphasized that it is "intolerable" for the U.S. government to decide on such an important issue as the use of nuclear weapons, and that the British government's guarantee that U.S. bombers cannot use nuclear weapons without the British government's consent is "absolutely insufficient."

A "Reynolds News" editorial emphasized that ordinary British people should, through the organizations they belong to, "demand that our national leaders renegotiate with the Russians."

    英工党领袖比万
　　要求制止带氢弹美机横行
    据新华社2日讯　塔斯社伦敦讯：英国工党著名活动家比万要求制止载有氢弹的飞机在英国和西欧上空飞行。比万在“世界新闻报”上指出，不管是从英国还是别的任何一个西方基地起飞的飞机如果投掷氢弹，都会“决定英国人民的命运”，因为苏联为了反击，必然要“包围所有能够向它进攻的基地”。
    比万强调，像使用核武器这样重要的问题，由美国政府来决定，这是“不能容忍的”，而英国政府关于美国轰炸机不经英国政府同意不能使用核武器这样的保证是“绝对不够的”。
    “雷诺新闻”社论强调，普通的英国人应通过自己所参加的组织“要求我们的国家首脑重新与俄国人谈判”。
