    Reader's Letters

    Don't Blindly Issue Introduction Letters Allowing Farmers to Flood into Cities
    Our Labor Department of the Beijing West Mining Area People's Committee often has farmers from other places holding introduction letters from their townships or communes seeking work. On August 22nd, Li Zhenfang, Li Yinwei, and six others, members of the Mingxing Agricultural Cooperative of Gaomentun Township, Quyang County, came to the Beijing West Mining Area with introduction letters from their agricultural cooperative requesting temporary work. On December 2nd, the People's Committee of Guchengchuan Township, Bakeshiying District, Luanping County, and the Zengfeng Third Agricultural Cooperative of the township issued an introduction letter to Wang Dexuan, a member of the township, to the Beijing West Mining Area requesting a job introduction.

    According to our understanding, quite a few farmers from the above two townships and cooperatives are coming out to find work with introduction letters, and they all come with the consent of township and cooperative cadres. It is understood that the travel expenses of these farmers seeking work are all borrowed from various sources, so it takes a lot of effort to persuade them to return to their hometowns for production.

    Although the State Council has repeatedly instructed to prevent farmers from blindly flowing into cities, it has not attracted their attention. I believe that blindly issuing introduction letters to allow farmers to find work in cities is wrong. This will not only fail to help farmers solve their living difficulties but also cause them economic losses.

    A Typical Bureaucrat
    Yuci County, Shanxi Province, transported a batch of sweet potato seeds by train from Tianzhen County on November 13th to establish a sweet potato superior seed breeding base. The shipping list for this batch of sweet potatoes clearly stated that the receiving unit was the Yuci County Grain Bureau, but the Yuci Railway Station did not check and hastily notified the Yuci City Vegetable Company to pick up the goods by phone. Cadres of the Vegetable Company went to the railway station without clarifying the origin and received the two train cars of sweet potatoes and also obtained an introduction letter from the City Grain Bureau. After the Vegetable Company received the sweet potatoes, they were distributed to various vegetable cooperatives in the city for vegetable sales.

    The occurrence of this accident was mainly due to the bureaucratic work style of Director Yang of the Railway Station Transportation Office and Zhang Peiliang, a cadre of the Yuci City Vegetable Company. I believe that these derelict bureaucrats should be severely dealt with and ordered to make a public self-criticism.

    Gansu Province Should Stop Farmers From Randomly Digging Licorice Roots
    In several districts of the western part of Otog Banner, Ik Zhao League, Inner Mongolia, farmers from some areas of Gansu Province often come to dig licorice roots. They have neither proof from the local People's Committee nor approval from our district's relevant departments, and they dig everywhere randomly, seriously affecting agricultural and pastoral production and damaging transportation. For example, after some farmers dig up the licorice roots, they do not fill the land with soil, and when the herders' sheep pass by, some sheep fall into the pits and die. In particular, some farmers dig licorice roots on the main roads, destroying the roads. Now, some have even dug into the farmland of the state-owned farm in the Fifth District of Otog Banner, damaging crops and affecting production. Therefore, I suggest that the relevant departments in Gansu Province should strengthen education for farmers and quickly stop this phenomenon from continuing, or, with the approval of the leading organs, come to dig in an organized manner.

    不要盲目开介绍信让农民流入城市
    我们京西矿区人民委员会劳动科经常有外地农民执着乡或社的介绍信来找工作。8月22日曲阳县高门屯乡明星农业社社员李振方、李银未等八人拿着农业社的介绍信到京西矿区来要求作临时工。12月2日滦平县巴克什营区古城川乡人民委员会及该乡增丰第三农业社给该乡社员王德轩开介绍信到京西矿区要求介绍工作。
    据我们了解，以上这两个乡、社开介绍信出来找工作的农民还不少，并且都是经过乡、社干部研究同意他们出来的。这些出来找工作的农民，据了解，他们的路费都是东拼西凑借来的，所以动员他们回乡生产也就很费口舌。
    虽经国务院一再指示防止农民盲目流入城市，但仍未引起他们的重视。我认为这样盲目开介绍信让农民到城市找工作是不对的。这不但不能帮助农民解决生活困难，反而给他们造成经济上的损失。

    典型的官僚主义者
    山西榆次县为了建立甘薯优种繁殖地，11月13日由天镇县用火车运回一批甘薯种籽。这批甘薯的运货单上明明写的收货单位是榆次县粮食局，但榆次火车站不进行查对，糊里糊涂的用电话通知榆次市蔬菜公司提货。蔬菜公司的干部到火车站也不问清来历，将两车皮甘薯接收走了，同时还到市粮食局开了介绍信。蔬菜公司接收这批甘薯以后，就分配给全市各蔬菜合作社当蔬菜销售去了。
    这次事故的产生，主要是火车站运输室杨主任和榆次市蔬菜公司干部张培梁的官僚主义作风造成的。我认为对这些失职的官僚主义者，要严格处理，并令其公开检讨。

    甘肃省应制止农民乱挖甘草根
    内蒙古伊克昭盟鄂托克旗西部的几个区，经常有甘肃省部分地区的农民来挖甘草根。他们既无当地人民委员会的证明，也不经我区有关部门的批准，到处乱挖，严重地影响了农牧业的生产和破坏了交通运输。例如有的农民挖完甘草根以后，不加土把地填平，牧民们的羊群经过时，有的羊只跌在坑里窝死。特别是有部分农民在大路上挖甘草根，把道路都破坏了。现在，有的已经挖到鄂托克旗五区国营农场的庄稼地里去了，损坏了庄稼，影响了生产。因此我建议甘肃省有关部门应当对农民加强教育，赶快制止这种现象继续下去，或者经领导机关批准以后，有组织地来挖。
