Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 11th: The first modern cement plant in Northwest China, the Yongdeng Cement Plant, officially commenced production on December 10th.

　　At 3 p.m. that day, a grand opening ceremony with over 2,000 people was held at the plant site. In addition to the leading Party and government officials of Gansu Province and Lanzhou City, the ceremony was attended by responsible persons from the Ministry of Building Materials Industry, the Heavy Industry Bureau of the State Planning Commission, and the China Heavy Industry Trade Union. The Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the German Democratic Republic to China, Mr. Gipner, and German experts who assisted in the construction of the plant also attended the ceremony.

　　When Jiao Shanmin, Chairman of the State Acceptance Committee and Vice Minister of the Ministry of Building Materials Industry, announced that the engineering quality of the cement plant met the specifications stipulated by the state, the entire venue erupted in warm applause. He also expressed gratitude on behalf of the government to the government of the German Democratic Republic for the assistance given in the construction of the plant and to the experts for their efforts in the construction.

　　Gipner spoke at the meeting. He said: The relations of mutual assistance between our two countries in various aspects embody the spirit of the treaty of friendship and cooperation signed by our two countries on December 25th two years ago. The commissioning of this factory, which we jointly built, is only one manifestation of the new relations established between socialist countries.

　　A representative of the German Democratic Republic experts also spoke at the meeting.

　　To express their gratitude to the experts, the Yongdeng Cement Plant presented them with silk banners on the spot.

　　At the meeting, the Yongdeng Cement Plant also donated one hundred tons of cement produced during the trial production to the farmers of Yongdeng County to show their support for farmland irrigation.

　　This cement plant, designed and supplied with complete sets of equipment by the German Democratic Republic, is one of the most mechanized and electrified cement plants in China. Its raw material, ore, is mined using flat tunnel and vertical shaft methods, then crushed twice and transported into the plant via a two-kilometer-long aerial ropeway. This method is a first in China's building materials industry.

　　The main product of the Yongdeng Cement Plant is No. 500 ordinary Portland cement, and it can also produce low-grade cement below No. 300. Next year, it will also produce a batch of oil well cement specifically for the Yumen Oil Mine.

　　In the past, the cement used in the Northwest region was transported from areas over 2,000 kilometers away, and the transportation costs were very high. After the Yongdeng Cement Plant is completed, it will save a lot of transportation costs.

    中德友谊开花结果
    永登水泥厂开工生产
    新华社兰州11日电　西北第一座现代化的水泥厂——永登水泥厂在12月10日正式开工生产。
    这天下午三时在厂地举行了二千多人的开工生产典礼大会，参加大会的除甘肃省、兰州市的党、政负责人外，还有建筑材料工业部、国家计划委员会重工业局和中国重工业工会的负责人，德意志民主共和国驻我国特命全权大使纪普纳和帮助建厂的德国专家也参加了大会。
    当国家验收委员会主任委员、建筑材料工业部副部长焦善民宣布水泥厂的工程质量符合国家规定的规格时，全场响起了热烈的掌声。他并代表政府感谢民主德国政府对这个厂的建设所给的帮助和专家在建厂中所作的努力。
    纪普纳在会上讲了话。他说：我们两国在各方面的互助关系，体现着我们两国在两年前的12月25日所签订的友好合作条约的精神。我们共同建设的这座工厂投入生产，它只是社会主义国家之间所建立起来的新关系的一个表现。
    民主德国专家代表也在会上讲了话。
    永登水泥厂为表示对专家的感谢，当场给专家赠送锦旗。
    在大会上，永登水泥厂还将试生产出来的一百吨水泥赠送给永登县农民，以表示对农田水利的支援。
    这座由民主德国帮助设计和供应成套设备的水泥厂，是我国目前机械化、电气化程度最高的水泥厂之一。它的原料——矿石是采用平洞、竖井的方法开采的，然后经过两次破碎，通过两公里长的架空索道运送入厂。这种作法在我国建筑材料工业上还是首创。
    永登水泥厂的主要产品是五百号普通矽酸盐水泥，也可生产三百号以下低标号水泥。明年还将生产一批油井水泥，专供玉门油矿使用。
    西北地区过去使用的水泥，是从二千公里以外的地区运来的，运费很高。永登水泥厂建成后，就可节省很多运费。
