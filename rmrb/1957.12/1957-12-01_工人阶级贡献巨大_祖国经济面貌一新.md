Xinhua News Agency, 30th: China's working class has made enormous contributions to the country during the first Five-Year Plan.

According to statistics from the State Statistical Bureau, by the end of this year, the total value of industrial products produced by workers nationwide over the five years (excluding individual handicrafts, the same below) is expected to reach 243.5 billion yuan. During the same period, the labor productivity of workers has continuously improved; taking 1952 as 100, it is expected to reach 155 in 1957.

The types and quantities of products produced by China's working class for the people during the first Five-Year Plan are also considerable. Calculated based on actual output from 1953 to the third quarter of this year, electricity has reached 62.8 billion kilowatt-hours, with an average of 100 kilowatt-hours per person nationwide; raw coal is 434.44 million tons, with an average of over 600 kilograms per person. From the time Li Hongzhang founded the Jiangnan Manufacturing Bureau in 1900 to start steel production until 1948, a period of 49 years, old China only produced 7.6 million tons of steel. However, steelworkers in new China produced 15.44 million tons of steel in just four years and three quarters of the first Five-Year Plan. It is estimated that the steel ingot output this year alone will be about 70% of the total steel ingot output in old China over 49 years. In terms of consumer goods, although often affected by insufficient raw material supply, textile and light industrial workers produced over 21 billion meters of cotton cloth, 3.9 million tons of edible oil, and 21.06 million tons of salt for the people in these four years and three quarters alone.

Thanks to the efforts of workers nationwide, China's industry reached the total output value level stipulated for 1957 in the first Five-Year Plan last year ahead of schedule. It is estimated that by the end of this year, it can exceed the original 1957 plan by 17%, an increase of 1.3 times compared to 1952. Among the 46 products included in the state plan, 35 have completed the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. In addition, workers nationwide have produced thousands of new products in these five years, including jet aircraft, trucks, over 200 different models of machine tools, and over 200 new types of steel. Workers in the light industrial sector have also added thousands of new varieties and designs of daily necessities for the people.

In terms of capital construction, with the hard work of exploration, design, construction, and installation workers nationwide and the active support of the people, the capital construction investment amount stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan has also been completed ahead of schedule. In these four years, more than 400 industrial enterprises above the quota nationwide have been put into production in whole or in part, 5,000 kilometers of railways and more than 40,000 kilometers of roads have been completed, and more than a dozen large reservoirs and over 100 million square meters of hospitals, schools, and residences have been completed one after another. In addition, many new mineral resources have been discovered. Due to the above-mentioned achievements in capital construction, China's economic outlook has undergone fundamental changes. At present, the total value of fixed assets nationwide has increased by more than half compared to 1952. The newly added fixed assets in the industrial sector alone in four years and nine months are more than 50% higher than the total industrial capital before liberation in 1936. The increase in these fixed assets has not only greatly improved the production capacity of industry and agriculture and improved people's lives, but also changed China's technological foundation. Among them, the automobile manufacturing plant, aircraft manufacturing plant, measuring tool and cutting tool plant, electron tube plant, radio factory, etc., which have been completed, are all industrial sectors that China has never had before and are technically top-notch.

In order to realize the first Five-Year Plan, China's working class launched a magnificent socialist emulation movement with a heroic and bold posture. In 1956, in the upsurge of the socialist revolution, in order to respond to the central government's call for more, better, faster, and more economical results, an unprecedented advanced producer movement was launched nationwide, which not only greatly advanced the competition but also brought socialist production and construction to a new upsurge. According to statistics, the rationalization proposals put forward by workers nationwide in just one year last year were equivalent to 90% of the total in the three years from 1953 to 1955. From the beginning of the first Five-Year Plan to the first half of this year, workers nationwide put forward a total of 4.56 million rationalization proposals and inventions, of which only 515,000 have been implemented and whose value can be calculated, saving the country more than 900 million yuan in wealth each year.

In the socialist emulation, labor models, advanced producers, advanced workers, and advanced collective units, including workshops, departments, work sections, and production teams, have always played a leading role in the working class. According to statistics, in the first four years of the Five-Year Plan, 2.6 million advanced producers were selected. Among them, Wang Chonglun, who runs ahead of time, Sheng Li, a high-speed cutting expert, Qian Fendi, a weaving model, Song Jiwu, a combine driver, Zheng Xikun, Li Xikui, and Yang Maolin, the initiators of the 500-ton-kilometer over-axle loading movement, Li Chuanjiang, who created the advanced soybean oil extraction method, Ai Zhaochang, the initiator of the 100,000-kilometer safe driving without major repairs movement, and the Ma Hengchang team have all made outstanding contributions to the production and construction of their respective industries.

### 工人阶级贡献巨大　祖国经济面貌一新

    工人阶级贡献巨大
　　祖国经济面貌一新
　　五年来工业总产值达二千多亿元，劳动生产率提高百分之五十五。生产和基本建设都可提前和超额达到五年计划水平。
    据新华社30日讯　我国工人阶级在第一个五年计划期间对国家作出了巨大的贡献。
    据国家统计局统计，到今年年底，全国工人在五年内生产的工业产品的总产值（不包括个体手工业，下同），预计将达到二千四百三十五亿元。在同一期间内，工人的劳动生产率不断提高；以1952年为一百，1957年预计能达到一百五十五。
    我国工人阶级在第一个五年计划期间为全国人民生产的产品种类及其数量，也是相当可观的。以1953年到今年第三季度的实际产量计算，电力已经达到六百二十八亿度，全国人民平均每人可以分到一百度；原煤四亿三百四十四万吨。平均每人可分到六百多公斤。旧中国从1900年李鸿章创办江南制造局开始出钢起到1948年的四十九年间，生产的钢只不过七百六十万吨；但是新中国的钢铁工人只在第一个五年计划的四年又三季度，就生产了钢铁一千五百四十四万吨，预计今年一年的钢锭产量就将等于旧中国四十九年钢锭产量总和的70％左右。在生活资料方面，虽然经常受到原料供应不足的影响，但是纺织和轻工业工人在这四年又三个季内，为全国人民仅是生产的棉布就有二百一十亿多公尺，食油三百九十万吨，盐二千一百零六万吨。
    由于全国工人的努力，我国工业在去年就提前达到了第一个五年计划规定的1957年总产值水平；预计到今年年底，可以超过原定1957年计划的17％，比1952年增长一点三倍。列入国家计划的四十六种产品中，已经有三十五种提前完成了五年计划。此外，全国工人在这五年内还生产出了几千种新产品，其中包括喷气式飞机、载重汽车、二百多种不同型号的机床、二百多种新种类的钢。轻工业部门的工人也为全国人民增加了几千种新品种新花色的日用品。
    基本建设方面，在全国勘探、设计、建筑、安装等工人的辛勤劳动和全国人民积极支援下，也已经提前完成了第一个五年计划规定的基本建设投资额。在这四年多时间内，全国有四百多个限额以上工业企业全部或部分投入了生产，五千公里的铁路和四万多公里的路修建完成，十几座大型水库和一亿多平方公尺建筑面积的医院、学校、住宅也先后落成。另外还发现了很多新的矿产资源。由于上述基本建设成就的取得，我国经济面貌已经起了根本变化。目前全国固定资产的总值，已经比1952年增加一半以上。光是工业部门在四年零九个月内新增加的固定资产，就比解放以前1936年全部工业资金还多50％以上。这些固定资产的增加，不但大大提高了工、农业的生产能力，改善了人民生活，同时改变了我国的技术基础。其中像已经建成的汽车制造厂、飞机制造厂、量具刃具厂、电子管厂、无线电厂等等，都是我国从来没有过的、技术上是头等的工业部门。
    我国工人阶级为实现第一个五年计划，以豪迈、英勇的姿态，广泛而深入地展开了波澜壮阔的社会主义竞赛运动。1956年，在社会主义革命高潮中，为了响应中央又多又好又快又省的号召，又在全国范围内开展了空前规模的先进生产者运动，不仅使竞赛大大向前推进了一步，而且使社会主义的生产和建设达到了新的高涨。据统计，只是去年一年内，全国工人提出的合理化建议就相当于1953年到1955年三年总和的90％。自第一个五年计划开始到今年上半年止，全国工人提出的合理化建议和创造发明，共达四百五十六万件，其中只是已经实现的和可以计算出价值的五十一万五千件，每年就能为国家节约九亿多元的财富。
    在社会主义竞赛中，工人阶级中的劳动模范、先进生产者、先进工作者，以及包括车间、部门、工段、生产小组等的先进集体单位，始终起着带头作用。据统计，在五年计划的前四年中，评选出先进生产者就有二百六十万人。其中如跑在时间前面的王崇伦，高速切削能手盛利，织布模范钱芬娣，康拜因司机宋继武，满载超轴五百吨公里运动倡议者郑锡坤、李锡奎、杨茂林，创造大豆先进榨油法的李川江，安全行驶十万公里无大修运动的发起者艾肇昌，以及马恒昌小组等对各该行各业的生产和建设都作了突出的贡献。
