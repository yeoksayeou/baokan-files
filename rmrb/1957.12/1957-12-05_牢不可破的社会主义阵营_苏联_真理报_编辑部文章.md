The declaration adopted by the conference of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries and the peace manifesto calling on workers and peasants, men and women, and all good people of the world, issued by the conference of representatives of more than sixty Communist and Workers' Parties, are the focus of world opinion. These are two important documents of great historical significance.

The declaration of the conference of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries reflects the urgent issues of the current international situation, the struggle for peace and socialism, and the relations between socialist countries and the Communist and Workers' Parties leading them. The declaration has significant theoretical and practical significance for the current international communist and workers' movement. It is a model of creative Marxism-Leninism, further clarifying the basic laws of the era of transition from capitalism to socialism, and pointing out to the working people the road to the final victory of the new social system – communism.

The conference that adopted this declaration powerfully demonstrated the unbreakable unity, common interests, and goals among socialist countries and the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries. The declaration particularly powerfully emphasizes that the growing and consolidating world socialist system is exerting an increasing influence on the international situation, thereby helping the cause of peace, progress, and people's freedom.

The expansion of socialism beyond the borders of one country into a world social-economic system, and the formation and consolidation of the socialist camp, are the main factors determining the international situation and the main characteristics of the current stage of social development. Comrade N.S. Khrushchev said in his report at the celebration of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet, the emergence of the world socialist system is the greatest achievement of the international communist and workers's movement and the victory of Marxism-Leninism.

The formation and development of the socialist camp prove the deepening and sharpening of the general crisis of the world capitalist system. The sharp increase in the economic strength and political influence of the socialist camp demonstrates the objective historical regularity and showcases the prospects of social development. The declaration states: "The main content of our era is the transition from capitalism to socialism, which began with the Great October Socialist Revolution in Russia."

The road opened up by the Great October Socialist Revolution and our outstanding victories have led to the development and strengthening of socialist forces around the world. The great Chinese people and the people of many countries in Europe and Asia have firmly embarked on the road of socialism. The socialist system is at such a stage that, in Marx's words, it can "develop on its own basis."

The process of formation and development of the new social structure – socialism – is fundamentally different from the process of formation and development of capitalism. The emergence of capitalism marked the cruel and merciless exploitation of millions of peasants and handicraftsmen. Capitalism began its road by enslaving the natives of the New World and burying them alive in gold and silver mines, by enslaving and plundering India and other countries in the East, and by turning Africa into a hunting ground for blacks.

The imperialists are unwilling to say how their wealth was formed in the past and in the present. They are silent about the fact that American imperialism extracts about ten billion U.S. dollars in profits from Latin American countries every year. The oil of the Near East gives the American and British monopolies about two billion U.S. dollars a year. Hundreds of millions of people in various countries suffer inhuman exploitation and live in abject poverty, while gold falls into the hands of the United States like raindrops.

Socialist countries do not build their happiness by exploiting, enslaving, or plundering the people of other countries. Their wealth is formed and increased by the labor of the people, whose common goal is to lead all working people onto the broad road of social and economic progress.

The socialist countries united into a unified camp are built on their common social and economic system, on the unity of their goals and tasks, and on the principles of Marxism-Leninism. Socialist countries strive to strengthen their firm unity because there are powerful imperialist countries opposed to them and jointly opposing the new social system.

The socialist camp is not a temporary group of these or those countries, but an association of countries that has emerged in the process of social development and in the struggle between socialism and capitalism, in accordance with their social and economic systems. This association is generated by the logic of class struggle and the logic of the struggle between socialism and capitalism on an international scale.

The declaration points out that the socialist countries are united in a unified family because they have embarked on the common socialist road, because their social and economic systems and state power have a common class essence, because they need to support and assist each other, because they have common interests and goals in the struggle against imperialism and for the victory of socialism and communism, and because they have common Marxist-Leninist thought. The fraternal mutual assistance and cooperation between socialist countries play a huge role in consolidating the economic and political independence of each socialist country and in strengthening the entire camp.

Today, the world socialist camp is a huge and ever-growing force. Currently, the socialist system accounts for more than 37% of the world's coal production, about a quarter of steel production, and about a third of cotton production. Socialist countries account for about one-third of the total world industrial production.

The huge potential of the socialist system and its irrefutable superiority over the capitalist system are becoming increasingly clear. One of the most obvious manifestations of the superiority of the socialist economic system is its economic development exceeding the high speed of the capitalist economic system year by year. The following table can most eloquently illustrate this point:

	Progress of industrial production in socialist and capitalist countries:
	1937	1950	1951	1952	1953	1954	1955	1956
Socialist countries	100	190	226	259	295	332	369	410
Capitalist countries	100	142	154	158	169	169	187	195

It can be seen that in 1956, the socialist countries had increased their industrial production to four times the 1937 production level (calculated according to the current territory of these countries), while the industrial production of the capitalist countries increased by less than twice during the same period. Socialist countries have made great achievements in many important industrial sectors. The following table can show how rapidly the national economy of socialist countries is growing:

	Growth of industrial production in socialist countries compared with the 1937 development level (calculated according to the current territory):

		Electricity		Coal (converted to hard coal)	Steel		Cotton fabrics
(Unit: billion kWh)	(Unit: million tons)		(Unit: million tons)	(Unit: billion square meters)
1937	1956	1937	1956	1937	1956	1937	1956
All socialist countries	66.8	293.5	261.1	713.7	23.9	68.2	4.6	9.6
Soviet Union		36.2	192.0	119.4	368.0	17.7	48.7	2.6	4.3※

※ If calculated by length, it is equal to 5.5 billion meters.

The great achievements of each socialist country in developing its own economy undeniably prove that socialism establishes a higher level of organization of social production than capitalism, which is characterized by anarchic production, crises, unemployment, and the impoverishment of the masses. As a result of the victory of socialism, the total industrial output of the Soviet Union in 1957 increased thirty-two times compared to 1913, while the production of means of production increased seventy-three times.

People's China is confidently moving forward along the road of socialist industrialization. For example, during the First Five-Year Plan, China's steel production was more than double the production in the half-century before liberation.

In People's Poland, as a result of the completion of the Six-Year Plan, industrial production has almost quadrupled compared to pre-war levels.

As everyone knows, capitalist Czechoslovakia was an industrially developed country. In the era of people's power, its economy advanced at a rate of development unseen in the old social system. Between the First and Second World Wars, the annual growth rate of industrial output in Czechoslovakia was 1%-2%, while the rate of industrial growth after the Second World War reached 10%-12% per year.

Accompanying the rapid development of industry is the transformation of agriculture on a socialist basis. The Soviet Union was the first to solve the task of socialist collectivization of agriculture along the path pointed out by Lenin. In the People's Republic of China, 97% of peasant households have joined cooperatives. In Bulgaria, socialist components account for 87% of arable land in agriculture; in Czechoslovakia, socialist components account for 60% of the land area; and in Romania, they account for over 42% of all agricultural land.

Based on the economic development of socialist countries and the achievements in industry and agriculture, the wealth of the people continues to grow, and the welfare of the working people is improving.

Another very important fact is that the Soviet Union and some people's democratic countries have caught up with and surpassed capitalist countries, including the United States, in the development level of some of the most important scientific and technological sectors, and are surpassing capitalist countries in the training of technical cadres. Here is shown the undeniable superiority of the socialist social system, showing that science and technology serve the people. In our era—the era of electricity and atomic energy, the era of automation and electronics—technical cadres are of decisive significance. It is precisely in this area that the capitalist system lags behind the socialist system.

Currently, there are more than six million experts with higher and secondary specialized education in the national economy of the Soviet Union, thirty-two times more than in old Russia. In China, from 1953 to 1957, the number of graduates from institutions of higher education was approximately seventy thousand more than from 1912 to 1947.

The world socialist economic system can harmoniously link the common interests of the socialist family with the unique interests of each sovereign state, can use the superiority of the new social system, and thereby ensure the most favorable conditions for all socialist countries in building the economic foundations of socialism and communism. Increasingly improved methods of economic cooperation, especially the widespread coordination of plans in the economic, scientific, and technological fields, are for this purpose. This is a new form of international economic mutual assistance that is only available to socialist countries.

The declaration states that the unity of socialist countries is a reliable guarantee of the national independence and sovereignty of each socialist country. This guarantee exists in the strength and power of the socialist camp and all socialist countries.

The indestructible socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is one of the great forces in the contemporary cause of maintaining peace. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "We believe that strengthening the unity of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union is the sacred international obligation of all socialist countries."

The achievements of the economic development of the socialist camp are the result of the resolute implementation of Marxism-Leninism, which transforms the world. The experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries in Europe and Asia proves the great vitality of Marxism-Leninism and the bankruptcy of reformist theories.

In the forty years since the October Revolution, in some European countries, including large capitalist countries such as Britain and France, right-wing social democrats have held power dozens of times. However, in any one country, their holding of power has not carried out any socialist reforms of the social system. In internal affairs, the right-wing social democrats continue to defend the interests of the capitalists; in foreign affairs, they pursue a policy of suppressing national liberation movements in Asia and Africa and provoking hatred towards socialist countries. Such is the result of the right-wing social democrats holding power; this is historical evidence of the bankruptcy of reformism.

Humanity now has the richest experience in building a socialist society. This is the experience of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all other socialist countries.

What does this international experience of socialist construction demonstrate? It shows that the process of socialist revolution and socialist construction follows some major laws that are universally applicable to all countries that embark on the road of socialism.

The declaration points out that these common laws are: the working class, with the Marxist-Leninist party at its core, leading the working masses in this or that form of proletarian revolution, establishing this or that form of proletarian dictatorship; establishing an alliance of the working class with the basic masses of peasants and other working strata; eliminating capitalist ownership of the basic means of production and establishing public ownership of the basic means of production; gradually realizing the socialist transformation of agriculture; planning the development of the national economy in order to build socialist and communist society and improve the living standards of the working people; carrying out socialist revolution in the ideological and cultural fields, creating a strong intellectual force loyal to the working class, the working people, and the socialist cause; eliminating national oppression, establishing equality and fraternal friendship between nations; defending the fruits of socialism and preventing it from being invaded by domestic and foreign enemies; practicing proletarian internationalism and uniting with the working class of all countries.

The declaration elevates this theory to a primary position: in building socialism, there must be leadership of the working masses by the working class and its Marxist-Leninist party.

Without the Marxist-Leninist party, as the vanguard of the working class, socialist countries cannot exist, the ruling class of the proletariat cannot be organized, and the tasks of socialist construction cannot be successfully carried out.

Historical experience proves that it is impossible to spontaneously build a new society. And it is impossible to arm the masses with knowledge of the laws of social development and to give material force to the great ideas of Marxism-Leninism without the leadership of the Party. That is the conclusion of history.

The major laws of socialist revolution and socialist construction summarized in the declaration have been verified by the historical and creative experience of the world socialist system, which has achieved tremendous success.

History has confirmed Lenin's brilliant thought about the diversity of forms and methods of socialist construction. Building a society without exploiters and the exploited is only possible when creatively applying the common laws of socialist revolution and socialist construction in accordance with the specific conditions of each country.

The process of humanity advancing towards socialism is certainly not exactly the same today as it was forty years ago. Time has brought some changes to this process. However, it does not involve the main and fundamental laws of the transition from capitalism to socialism.

For example, in some countries, it is now possible to implement universal suffrage from the beginning of the socialist transformation of the country's social life. This real possibility did not exist in the Soviet Union forty years ago. The possibility of using parliamentary organs as an organizational form of power has emerged. New forms of proletarian dictatorship have emerged—people's democratic power, the people's democratic dictatorship in China. But objective laws show that various forms of proletarian dictatorship are an inevitable stage of socialist development.

The declaration also emphasizes that in socialist countries, the working masses enjoy true freedom and democratic rights.

One of the important signs of a socialist society is the extensive participation of the masses of the people in the management of the state and in the work of state leading organs. For example, the elections of local Soviets held in the republics of the Soviet Union at the beginning of this year elected more than 1.5 million representatives from among the workers.

The elections of local people's congresses held in the People's Republic of China in 1956 elected approximately five million representatives from among workers, peasants, intellectuals, members of various parties, and representatives of minority nationalities.

Let those bourgeois activists who talk so much about their democracy compare the materials on the participation of the masses of people in the management of the state in the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries with the materials on the participation of the masses of people in the management of the state in capitalist countries.

For centuries, the exploiting classes and their thinkers have asserted that the working masses do not have organizational talent and are not competent to manage the state and the national economy. Socialism has overturned this false myth. The workers of the Soviet Union and various socialist countries have promoted many outstanding organizers of industry and agriculture, great state activists, and brilliant political leaders from their ranks. The working masses have shown the greatest organizational talent and have shown the world examples of managing the national economy, managing all social affairs, and managing state affairs in an exemplary manner.

The basis of the unity of the socialist camp is the great principle of proletarian internationalism, the idea and policy of the international solidarity of the working class—the staunch fighter for the progress and freedom of all nations, and for socialism.

The fundamental social, economic, political, and ideological differences between the two camps of capitalism and socialism determine that the mutual relations of the socialist camp countries are completely different from the mutual relations of the imperialist camp countries. In the capitalist world, the principle of force—the principle of the strong preying on the weak—is implemented, and the policy of oppression, intimidation, creating wars, and seizing other people's land, sources of raw materials, and sales markets is carried out.

Between socialist countries, another unprecedented new relationship has been formed. All problems and mutual relations can be completely resolved through comradely discussions on the basis of strict adherence to the principles of socialist internationalism.

In mutual relationships, socialist countries steadfastly implement the principles of complete equality, respect for territorial integrity, respect for national independence and sovereignity, and non-interference in internal affairs.

Socialist camp countries regard mutual assistance and further consolidation of the unity of the socialist camp as their lofty internationalist obligation.

In order to consolidate the fraternal relations and friendship between socialist countries, Communist and Workers' Parties must implement a Marxist-Leninist internationalist policy, educate all working people in the spirit of combining internationalism and patriotism, and resolutely overcome the remnants of bourgeois nationalism and chauvinism. This is the consensus expressed by the Communist and Workers' Parties in the declaration.

V.I. Lenin demonstrated the possibility and necessity of peaceful coexistence between two systems—the capitalist system and the socialist system. The Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries believe that the Leninist principle of peaceful coexistence between two systems, which has been further developed in the resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU under the current conditions, is the unshakable foundation of the foreign policy of socialist countries and a reliable basis for peace and friendship between the people of all countries.

The declaration points out: At present, it is in the vital interests of the working people of all countries to support the Soviet Union and all socialist countries, which implement a policy of maintaining world peace and are a bastion of peace and social progress. The working class, democratic forces, and working people of all countries are concerned with constantly consolidating fraternal ties for the benefit of the common cause, protecting the historical, political, and social achievements of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all socialist countries—the first and most powerful socialist countries—from any conspiracies of the enemies of socialism, and expanding and consolidating these achievements.

The growth of the socialist system, the achievements of the socialist camp, and the expansion of the attractiveness of Marxist-Leninist thought have caused panic and fear for the fate of capitalism in the imperialist camp.

International imperialism, headed by the most reactionary groups in the United States, is attempting to obstruct the forward, law-abiding development of human society. World reactionaries are carrying out constant sabotage activities against socialist countries. Faced with the indestructible power of Marxist-Leninist thought and the truth as bright as the sun, the theorists of capitalism cannot put forward anything decent to counter it, so they seize on some nationalistic prejudices and bring out the so-called "national communism" thought, which, according to its authors, can split the socialist camp.

The reactionaries' attack on Marxism has aroused the activism of various revisionist schools and views, revived the opportunistic thoughts that have long been abandoned by history, and made dogmatism and sectarianism prevail. Dogmatism and sectarianism hinder the development of Marxist-Leninist theory and the creative application of it in specific, changed conditions, and alienate the Party from the masses. The conference emphasized the need to resolutely overcome revisionism and dogmatism in the ranks of the Communist and Workers' Parties, and that revisionism is the main danger under the current conditions.

No matter how hard the imperialists and their accomplices try, they have not been able to, and will never be able to, shake the foundation of the socialist camp. The fraternal communist parties, armed with Marxist-Leninist theory, having full experience in fighting the enemies of socialism, and being good at identifying enemies wearing any masks, are giving due counterattacks to their hostile activities.

The recently held 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the 8th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the congresses of the communist parties of France, Italy, and some other countries, and the meeting of representatives of the communist and workers' parties in Moscow during the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, clearly showed the unity of the party ranks and the Communist Party's unwavering loyalty to the principles of proletarian internationalism and the revolutionary banner of Marxism-Leninism.

The Communist Party has won victory and is still winning victory with its loyalty to Marxism-Leninism and the principles of proletarian internationalism. They are determined to continue to hold high the banner of proletarian international solidarity in the future.

The two declarations have added greater confidence to the people of all countries in the victory of the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism, and in the complete victory of Marxist-Leninist thought, which illuminates the path of mankind towards communism.

    牢不可破的社会主义阵营
　　苏联“真理报”编辑部文章
    社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议通过的宣言和六十多个国家的共产党和工人党代表会议向工人和农民们、男人和妇女们、全世界一切善良的人们呼吁的和平宣言，是世界舆论注意的中心。这是两个具有巨大历史意义的重要文件。
    社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言反映了当前国际局势的迫切问题、争取和平和社会主义的斗争、社会主义国家之间和领导这些国家的共产党和工人党之间的关系问题。宣言对于当前国际共产主义运动和工人运动具有重大的理论和现实意义。它是创造性的马克思列宁主义的典范，它更加明确地揭示了由资本主义向社会主义过渡的时代的基本规律，向劳动人民指出了新的社会制度——共产主义走向最后胜利的道路。
    通过这项宣言的会议有力地表明了社会主义国家、社会主义国家共产党和工人党之间的牢不可破的团结一致、共同的利益和目的。宣言特别有力地强调指出，日益壮大和巩固的世界社会主义体系，正在给予国际局势越来越大的影响，从而帮助了争取和平、进步和人民自由的事业。
    社会主义越出一国的范围而变成世界社会经济体系，社会主义国家阵营的形成和巩固，是决定国际局势的主要因素，是社会发展现阶段的主要特征。尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志在苏联最高苏维埃庆祝会的报告中说，世界社会主义体系的产生，是国际共产主义运动和工人运动的最伟大成果，是马克思列宁主义的胜利。
    社会主义阵营的形成和发展证明，世界资本主义体系总危机的深刻化和尖锐化。社会主义阵营经济威力和政治影响的急剧提高，表明客观的历史规律性，并且展示出社会发展的前景。宣言写道：“我们时代的主要内容是由俄国伟大十月社会主义革命所开始的由资本主义向社会主义的过渡。”
    伟大十月社会主义革命所开辟的道路和我国的卓越胜利引起了全世界社会主义力量的发展和增强。伟大的中国人民和欧亚两洲许多国家的人民，已经稳固地走上了社会主义的道路。社会主义体系正处在这样的阶段上，用马克思的话来说就是，它已能在“本身的基础上发展”。
    新的社会结构——社会主义的形成和发展的进程，同资本主义形成和发展的进程根本不同。资本主义的出现标志了对千百万农民和手工业者残酷无情的剥削。资本主义是靠奴役新世界的土著居民并把他们活埋在金矿银矿当中而开始了自己的道路的，是靠奴役和抢劫印度和东方其他国家、把非洲变为猎取黑人的禁区而开始了自己的道路的。
    帝国主义者不愿意说过去和现在他们的财富是怎样形成的。他们闭口不谈美帝国主义每年从拉丁美洲国家榨取约十亿美元的利润。近东的石油一年给美国和英国的垄断资本约二十亿美元。世界各国千千万万的人们遭受着非人的剥削，生活在赤贫中，而黄金却像雨点般地落到美国手中。
    社会主义国家既不是靠剥削，也不是靠奴役和掠夺其他国家的人民来建立自己的幸福，它们的财富是由人民的劳动形成和增多起来的，他们共同努力的目的，是要把全体劳动人民都引上社会和经济进步的康庄大道。
    社会主义国家联合成统一的阵营，是建立在它们共同的社会经济制度上，建立在它们的目标和任务的一致上，建立在马克思列宁主义的原则上。社会主义国家尽力加强它们之间的牢固团结，因为有强有力的帝国主义国家同它们相对立，并共同反对新的社会制度。
    社会主义阵营不是这些或那些国家的临时性的集团，而是在社会发展过程中、在社会主义和资本主义之间的斗争过程中产生的符合于它们的社会经济制度的各国的联合。这种联合是由阶级斗争的逻辑和在国际范围内社会主义和资本主义之间斗争的逻辑产生的。
    宣言中指出，社会主义国家团结在统一的大家庭里，是由于它们走上了共同的社会主义道路，由于它们的社会经济制度和国家政权有共同的阶级实质，由于它们需要互相支持和援助，由于它们在反对帝国主义、争取社会主义和共产主义胜利的斗争中有共同的利益和目的，由于它们有共同的马克思列宁主义思想。社会主义国家彼此兄弟般的互相援助和合作在巩固社会主义每一个国家的经济和政治独立以及在加强整个阵营方面起着巨大的作用。
    今天，世界社会主义阵营是一支不断壮大的巨大力量。现在，社会主义体系的采煤量占全世界采煤量的37％以上，钢铁产量约占四分之一，棉花产量约占三分之一。在世界工业生产总量中，社会主义国家约占三分之一。
    社会主义体系的巨大潜力和它对资本主义体系的无可辩驳的优越性，越来越明白地显示出来了。社会主义经济体系的优越性的最明显的表现之一，就是它的经济发展一年比一年地越过资本主义经济体系的高速度。下表可以最雄辩地说明这点：
        社会主义国家和资本主义国家工业生产的进展情况：
              1937 1950 1951 1952 1953 1954 1955 1956社会主义国家100 190 226 259 295 332　369 410资本主义国家100 142 154 158 169 169 187 195
    由此可见，1956年，社会主义国家已把工业生产量提高到1937年（按这些国家现在的领土范围计）生产水平的四倍，而资本主义国家的工业生产在同时期却提高不到两倍。社会主义国家在许多重要工业部门中都取得了很大的成绩。下表可以表明，社会主义国家的国民经济在怎样迅速地增长着：
          社会主义国家工业生产与1937年发展水平（按现在的领土
            范围计）相比的增长情况：电力
      煤（折合为硬煤计）钢　棉织品（单位：十亿度）（单位：百万吨）（单位：百万吨）
    （单位：十亿平方公尺）1937 1956 1937 1956 1937 1956 1937 1956所有的社会主义国家66.8　293.5　261.1　713.7　23.9　68.2
　4.6　9.6苏　联　36.2　192.0　119.4　368.0　17.7　48.7　2.6
　4.3※
    ※如按长度计等于五十五亿公尺。
    每个社会主义国家发展自己经济的巨大成就，都无可争辩地证明社会主义比具有生产无政府状态、危机、失业、群众贫困化的资本主义建立有社会生产的更高级的组织形式。社会主义胜利的结果，苏联1957年的工业产品总量比1913年增加了三十二倍，而生产资料的生产增加了七十三倍。
    人民中国正满怀信心地沿着社会主义工业化道路前进。例如，在第一个五年计划期间，中国的钢产量比解放前半个世纪的产量还多一倍多。
    在人民波兰，由于六年计划完成的结果，工业生产量几乎超过战前四倍。
    大家知道，资本主义的捷克斯洛伐克是一个工业发达的国家。在人民政权年代，它的经济以在旧社会制度下见所未见的发展速度前进着。在第一次和第二次世界大战之间，捷克斯洛伐克工业产量的年增长率为1％—2％，而第二次世界大战后工业增长的速度达到每年10％—12％。
    伴随着工业迅速发展而来的是在社会主义基础上的农业改造。苏联第一个沿着列宁指出的道路解决了农业社会主义集体化的任务。在中华人民共和国，加入合作社的已占农户总数的97％。在保加利亚，社会主义成分在农业中占耕地的87％，在捷克斯洛伐克，社会主义成分占土地面积的60％，在罗马尼亚则在全部农业用地中占42％强。
    在社会主义国家经济发展、工农业成就的基础上，人民的财富不断增长，劳动人民的福利正在提高。
    另一个非常重要的事实是：苏联和一些人民民主国家在某些最重要的科学技术部门的发展水平方面赶上并且超过了资本主义国家，其中包括美国，在培养技术干部方面正在超过资本主义国家。在这里显示出社会主义社会制度不可争辩的优越性，显示出科学和技术是为人民服务的。在我们这个时代——电气和原子能时代、自动化和电子学时代——技术干部有着决定性的意义。资本主义制度正是在这方面落后于社会主义制度了。
    目前在苏联国民经济中有六百多万受过高等和中等专门教育的专家，比旧俄多三十二倍。在中国，从1953年到1957年，高等学校毕业生比1912年到1947年大约多七万人。
    世界社会主义经济体系能够使社会主义大家庭的共同利益同每一个主权国家的独特利益和谐地联系起来，能够利用新社会制度的优越性，并以此保证所有的社会主义国家在建立社会主义和共产主义的经济基础中有最顺利的条件。日益改进的经济合作方法，特别是在经济、科学和技术方面的计划的广泛配合方法，就是为了这个目的。这是一种新的、只为社会主义国家所有的国际经济互助的形式。
    宣言中说，社会主义各国的团结一致，是每一个社会主义国家的民族独立和主权的可靠保证。这种保证存在于社会主义阵营和一切社会主义国家的力量和强大之中。
    以苏联为首的不可摧毁的社会主义阵营是当代维护和平事业的巨大力量之一。毛泽东同志说过：“我们认为，增强以苏联为首的社会主义各国的团结，是一切社会主义国家的神圣的国际义务。”
    社会主义阵营各国经济发展的成就，是坚决实现了改造世界的马克思列宁主义的结果。苏联和欧亚各人民民主国家的社会主义建设经验，证明了马克思列宁主义的伟大生命力和改良主义理论的破产。
    自十月革命以来的四十年间，在欧洲的一些国家，其中包括像英、法这样的大资本主义国家，由右翼社会党人掌握政权曾不下几十次。但是，在任何一个国家，他们的握有政权都没有对社会制度进行过任何社会主义的改革。在内政方面，右翼社会党人继续维护资本家的利益，在外交方面，他们则推行镇压亚非各国民族解放运动的方针，挑拨对社会主义国家的仇恨。右翼社会党人掌握政权的结果就是如此，这是改良主义破产的历史证据。
    人类现在已有了最丰富的建设社会主义社会的经验。这就是苏联、中华人民共和国和其他一切社会主义国家的经验。
    社会主义建设的这种国际性的经验说明了什么呢？它说明社会主义革命和社会主义建设的过程，遵循着普遍适用于各个走上社会主义道路的国家的一些主要规律。
    宣言中指出这些共同的规律是：以马克思列宁主义政党为核心的工人阶级，领导劳动群众进行这种形式或那种形式的无产阶级革命，建立这种形式或那种形式的无产阶级专政；建立工人阶级同农民基本群众和其他劳动阶层的联盟；消灭基本生产资料资本主义所有制和建立基本生产资料的公有制；逐步实现农业的社会主义改造；有计划地发展国民经济，以便建成社会主义和共产主义，提高劳动人民的生活水平；进行思想文化领域的社会主义革命，造成忠于工人阶级、劳动人民和社会主义事业的强大的知识分子队伍；消灭民族压迫，建立各民族间的平等和兄弟友谊；保卫社会主义果实，不让它受到国内外敌人的侵犯；实行无产阶级的国际主义，同各国工人阶级团结一致。
    宣言中把这一理论提到了首要地位：在建设社会主义时必须要有工人阶级及其马克思列宁主义的政党对劳动群众的领导。
    没有作为工人阶级的先锋队的马克思列宁主义的政党，社会主义国家就不可能存在，就不能组织无产阶级这个统治阶级，就不能成功地执行社会主义建设的任务。
    历史经验证明，自发地建设新社会是不可能的。而以社会发展规律的知识武装群众，赋予马克思列宁主义的伟大思想以物质力量，没有党的领导作用是不可能的。历史的结论就是这样。
    宣言中所总结的社会主义革命和社会主义建设的各项主要规律，都得到了获得巨大成就的世界社会主义体系的群众的历史性创造经验的验证。
    历史证实了列宁关于社会主义建设形式和方法的多样化的天才思想。建设一个没有剥削者和被剥削者的社会，只有在按照各国的具体条件，创造性地运用社会主义革命和社会主义建设的共同规律时，才有可能。
    人类向社会主义前进的过程，今天当然已经同四十年前不完全相同了。时间给这个过程带来了一些变化。然而，它却不会涉及到从资本主义向社会主义过渡的主要的、根本的规律。
    例如，在一些国家里，现在能够从国家的社会生活开始实现社会主义改造时就实行普遍的选举权。这种现实的可能性，在四十年前的苏联是没有的。出现了利用议会机关作为政权的组织形式的可能。出现了无产阶级专政的新形式——人民民主政权，中国的人民民主专政。但是客观的规律性说明，各种不同形式的无产阶级专政是社会主义发展的不可避免的阶段。
    宣言还强调指出，在社会主义国家，劳动群众享有真正的自由和民主权利。
    社会主义社会的重要标志之一，就是广泛吸引人民群众参加管理国家，参加国家领导机关的工作。例如，今年年初在苏联各共和国举行的地方苏维埃的选举，就从劳动者中间选出了一百五十多万名代表。
    1956年在中华人民共和国举行的地方人民代表大会的选举，从工人、农民、知识分子、各政党成员、少数民族代表中，选出了大约五百万名代表。
    让那些大谈其民主的资产阶级活动家，把苏联、中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家关于人民群众参加管理国家的材料同资本主义国家吸引人民群众参加管理国家的材料作一番比较吧。
    多少世纪以来，剥削者阶级和他们的思想家都断言说，劳动群众没有组织才干，不能胜任管理国家和国民经济的任务。社会主义推翻了这种虚伪的神话。苏联和各社会主义国家的劳动者从自己的行列中推举出许许多多卓越的工农业组织者，伟大的国务活动家和英明的政治领袖。劳动群众表现出了最伟大的组织才干，向全世界表明了模范地管理国民经济、管理一切社会事业和国家事务的范例。

    社会主义阵营团结一致的基础是无产阶级国际主义的伟大原则，是工人阶级——争取各族人民进步和自由、争取社会主义的坚决战士——国际团结的思想和政策。
    资本主义和社会主义两个阵营之间的社会经济、政治和思想的根本分歧，决定了社会主义阵营国家的相互关系同帝国主义阵营国家的相互关系是截然不同的。在资本主义世界实行的是强力原则——强凌弱的原则，执行着强压、恫吓、制造战争、夺取他人土地、原料来源和销售市场的政策。
    在社会主义国家之间则形成了另外一种前所未见的新关系。所有的问题和相互关系，完全可以在严格遵守社会主义的国际主义原则的基础上通过同志式的讨论加以解决。
    在相互关系上，社会主义国家坚定不渝地执行着完全平等、尊重领土完整、尊重国家独立和主权、互不干涉内政的原则。
    社会主义阵营国家认为互相援助、进一步巩固社会主义阵营的团结是自己崇高的国际主义义务。
    为了巩固社会主义各国间的兄弟关系和友谊，共产党和工人党必须执行马克思列宁主义的国际主义政策，用国际主义和爱国主义相结合的精神教育全体劳动人民，坚决克服资产阶级民族主义和沙文主义的残余。这是共产党和工人党在宣言中表示的一致意见。
    弗·伊·列宁论证了两种制度——资本主义制度和社会主义制度和平共处的可能性和必要性。社会主义国家的共产党和工人党认为，根据当前条件在苏共第二十次代表大会的决议中得到了进一步发展的关于两种制度和平共处的列宁主义原则，是社会主义国家对外政策的不可动摇的基础，是各国人民之间和平友好的可靠基础。
    宣言指出：目前，各国劳动者对于执行维护世界和平政策的并且是和平和社会进步的堡垒的苏联和所有社会主义国家给以支持，是符合他们的切身利益的。各国工人阶级、民主力量和劳动者所关切的，是为了共同事业的利益不断地巩固兄弟联系，是维护第一个和最强大的社会主义国家苏联、中华人民共和国和所有社会主义国家所取得的历史、政治和社会成果，使它们不受社会主义敌人的任何阴谋所侵犯，并且扩大和巩固这些成果。
    社会主义体系的成长，社会主义阵营的成就，马克思列宁主义思想吸引力的扩大，在帝国主义阵营中引起了对资本主义命运的慌乱和恐惧。
    以美国最反动的集团为首的国际帝国主义，企图阻挠人类社会一往直前的、合乎规律的发展。世界反动派对社会主义国家进行着经常不断的破坏活动。资本主义的理论家面对马克思列宁主义思想不可摧毁的力量和光明如太阳的真理，提不出任何像样的东西来与之相抗，便抓住一些民族主义的偏见，而端出了按其作者所说可以分裂社会主义阵营的所谓“民族共产主义”思想。
    反动派对马克思主义的进攻，引起了各种修正主义流派和观点的活跃，使早已为历史所抛弃了的机会主义思想复活，使教条主义和宗派主义盛行。教条主义和宗派主义阻碍马克思列宁主义理论的发展和在具体的、变化了的条件下创造性地应用它，并使党脱离群众。代表会议着重指出必须在共产党和工人党的队伍中坚决克服修正主义和教条主义，而在目前条件下修正主义是主要的危险。
    不管帝国主义者及其帮凶如何挖尽心思，他们没有能够，而且也绝不能够动摇社会主义阵营的基础。以马克思列宁主义理论武装起来的、有对社会主义敌人进行斗争的充分经验、并善于辨认戴着任何假面具的敌人的各兄弟共产主义政党，对他们的敌意活动正在给以应有的回击。
    近来举行的苏联共产党第二十次代表大会，中国共产党第八次全国代表大会，法国、意大利和其他一些国家共产党的代表大会，以及在庆祝十月革命四十周年的日子里各共产党和工人党代表在莫斯科举行的会议，鲜明地表示出党的队伍的团结一致，共产党对无产阶级国际主义原则、对马克思列宁主义革命旗帜的不可动摇的忠诚。
    共产党是以对马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义原则的忠诚获得了胜利，并且还正在获得胜利。他们决心今后仍要高举无产阶级国际团结的旗帜。
    两个宣言给各国人民对和平、民主和社会主义事业的胜利，对照耀着人类走向共产主义道路的马克思列宁主义思想的完全胜利，增添了更大的信心。　（原载苏联“真理报”11月27日，王佐昌译）
