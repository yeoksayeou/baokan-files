Many people like to wear knitted underwear. In winter, many people wear woolen sweaters and woolen trousers, while some wear cotton undershirts and cotton underpants. In summer, many people wear T-shirts and vests. Especially since the supply of cotton cloth has been reduced, more people are wearing knitted underwear. Therefore, how to make knitted underwear more durable is common knowledge that everyone wants to know.

The most important point in protecting knitted underwear is that you should not use a brush when washing it, nor should you rub it hard on a washboard. The best way to wash it is to first soak the dirty underwear in clean water to remove the dust on the clothes; then, apply soap to the wet clothes, let it sit for a while, and then gently rub it with your hands, which will wash it very clean without damaging the clothes. When washing colored knitted underwear, do not soak it in boiling water, and do not expose it to the hot sun after washing, so as to keep the color bright and lasting.

If you don't plan to wear newly bought white knitted underwear for the time being, it is best to wash it with clean water first and then put it away. Because general white T-shirts, etc., have to be bleached, and if they are stored for too long, yellow spots will appear.

Do not wear woolen sweaters and woolen trousers directly against the skin. Because the fluff sticking to the skin is not comfortable, and at the same time, the fluff will be turned into fluff balls by sweat stains, losing its warmth. When drying woolen clothes, the fluff should face the sun, which can make the fluff soft and also avoid fading on the front.

    怎样保护针织内衣？
    很多人都喜欢穿针织内衣。冬天，许多人穿绒衣、绒裤，有些人穿棉毛衫、棉毛裤；夏天，很多人都要穿汗衫、背心。特别是棉布供应量缩减以后，穿针织内衣的人更多。因此，怎样使针织内衣更耐穿些？这是大家都想知道的常识。
    保护针织内衣的最重要的一点，是洗的时候不能用刷子刷，也不能用力在搓板上搓。最好的洗法是：先把穿脏了的内衣放在清水里泡一泡，去掉衣服上的尘土；然后，在湿衣服上抹上肥皂，放一些时候，再用手轻揉，就能洗得很干净，又不伤衣服。染色的针织内衣洗的时候切勿用开水泡，洗好后也不要在烈日下晒，这样可以保持颜色鲜明持久。
    新买来的白色针织内衣，如果暂时不穿的话，最好先用清水洗一次，再放起来。因为一般的白汗衫等都要经过漂白，储存时间过长，就会发生黄色斑点。
    绒衣、绒裤不要贴着肉穿。因为绒毛粘在皮肤上既不舒服，同时绒毛也会被汗渍弄成绒毛球，失去保暖作用。晒绒衣的时候，应该使绒毛面向着太阳，这样可使绒毛松软，还可以避免正面褪色。
