Xinhua News Agency Special Dispatch: The Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to transfer 150 party member cadres from provincial-level organs and industrial and mining enterprises to strengthen the work of cultural and educational departments.

　　The first group of 50 party member cadres who went to support the cultural and educational front have mostly been assigned to secondary technical schools and middle schools in various cities and counties of the province, serving as principals, vice principals, or deputy secretaries of the Party general branch. The second group is also about to depart.

　　Before being assigned to their posts, these cadres visited Jilin Provincial Experimental Middle School. Leaders from the Provincial Party Committee's Cultural and Educational Department and the Provincial Education Department briefed them on the current rectification situation in various secondary schools and the current teaching policies.

Xinhua News Agency Special Dispatch: Chongqing Municipality recently transferred more than 160 cadres from Party committees and government departments to support the cultural and educational front. The vast majority of these cadres are Communist Party members. Most of them have been transferred to ordinary middle schools to serve as principals and political instructors. Currently, there are already sixty-two Party general branches and branches in ordinary middle schools, an increase of twenty-five branches compared to before the start of the rectification movement, and the number of Party members among the faculty and staff has also nearly doubled. After these cadres were dispatched, they strengthened political and ideological education work and strengthened the relationship between the Party and the masses. After Communist Party member Wang Xialiang became the principal of Chongqing No. 41 Middle School, he was loved by teachers and students. He can consult with the masses on matters, solving the long-standing problem of the school - administrative meetings were unable to resolve major events and were not regularized; at the same time, he also established meeting systems for the academic affairs, general affairs, and other departments.

    本报特约新华社专稿　重庆市最近从党委和政府部门抽调了一百六十多个干部支援文教战线。这些干部绝大部分是共产党员。他们大多数被调到普通中学去作校长和政治教员。目前，普通中学中党的总支和支部，已经有六十二个，比整风运动开始前增加了二十五个支部，教职员中的党员人数也增加将近一倍。这些干部派下去以后，加强了政治思想教育工作，密切了党群关系。共产党员王霞量担任重庆市第四十一中学的校长后，师生们都喜爱他。他有事能找群众商量，把这个学校长期存在的问题——行政会议不能解决重大事件和经常化的问题解决了；同时，还建立了教务、总务等部门的会议制度。
