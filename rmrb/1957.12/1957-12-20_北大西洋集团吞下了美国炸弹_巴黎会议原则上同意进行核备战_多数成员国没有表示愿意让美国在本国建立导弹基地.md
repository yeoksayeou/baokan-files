Xinhua News Agency, December 19th: Paris Dispatch: The Defense Ministers and Foreign Ministers of the fifteen member countries of the North Atlantic Group held a joint secret meeting on the morning and afternoon of the 18th, mainly discussing military and political issues. In the evening, the heads of government of the fifteen countries also held a secret meeting. News emanating from the meeting stated that the group's member states had reached a "principled" agreement on the United States' plan to establish medium-range missile launch bases and nuclear weapon storage depots in Western Europe. Thus, under the prodding of the United States, the North Atlantic Group has taken a step forward on the path of atomic armaments.

Since the meeting on the 17th reached an agreement on a so-called "two-pronged" compromise, news has been circulating here that the United States, under the strong pressure from Western European countries, both inside and outside the meeting, demanding negotiations with the Soviet Union and opposing the establishment of nuclear missile bases on their territory, has been forced to reluctantly agree to "explore" the Soviet Union's attitude through diplomatic channels. At the same time, it uses this as a bargaining chip to force its allies to make sacrifices for atomic armaments.

According to various reports, to actually implement the aforementioned "principled" agreement, the relevant countries must conduct bilateral negotiations with the United States separately and conclude specific agreements. Sources say that Norway and Denmark have indicated that they still oppose the establishment of missile bases and nuclear weapon storage depots on their territories, although they generally do not object to doing so in Western Europe. Currently, besides Britain, which has already negotiated with the United States to establish four medium-range missile bases in Britain, only the Netherlands and Turkey among the other members of the North Atlantic Group have clearly expressed their willingness to allow the United States to establish such bases.

Observers point out that the progress of the United States' missile base plan has been so slow, which Eisenhower and Dulles did not originally anticipate.

It is revealed that the meeting on the 18th also reached a "principled" agreement on the establishment of the North Atlantic Group's "balanced collective forces" (especially in naval, air defense, and logistics). Agreements were also reached on cooperation in weapon research, development, and production, and it is said that an "Atlantic Science Committee" will be established for this purpose, and "scientific advisors" will be appointed. In addition, on the issue of economic cooperation, it is said that a special institution has been decided to be established to assist the more backward countries in the group.

It is reported that the drafting of the final communique of the North Atlantic Group's heads of government meeting was accelerated on the 18th. Belgian Foreign Minister Larock, who participated in the drafting work, stated after the heads of government meeting on the evening of the 18th that the issue of seeking to resume disarmament negotiations with the Soviet Union, which had occupied most of the time at the meeting on the 17th, still needed to "reach consensus" at the final meeting of the fifteen heads of government on the morning of the 19th.

In addition, according to North Atlantic Group Secretary-General Spaak, the issue of the group's relationship with other military blocs is also one of the "highly contentious issues." On this issue, a proposal supported by the United States calls for these military blocs to regularly exchange intelligence and working documents. However, diplomatic observers point out that some North Atlantic Group member states far from the Middle East, such as Norway, Denmark, and Canada, are not enthusiastic about establishing connections.

### 北大西洋集团吞下了美国炸弹  巴黎会议原则上同意进行核备战  多数成员国没有表示愿意让美国在本国建立导弹基地

    北大西洋集团吞下了美国炸弹
    巴黎会议原则上同意进行核备战
    多数成员国没有表示愿意让美国在本国建立导弹基地
    据新华社19日讯　巴黎消息：北大西洋集团十五个成员国的国防部长和外交部长在18日上午和下午举行了联席秘密会议，主要讨论军事和政治问题。傍晚时分，十五国的政府首脑也举行了秘密会议。会后传出来的消息说，这个集团的成员国已经就美国在西欧建立中程导弹发射基地和核武器储存库的计划达成了“原则性”协议。这样，北大西洋集团就在美国的鞭策下在原子备战道路上跨进了一步。
    自从17日会议就一项所谓“双管齐下”的折衷办法达成协议后，这里就流传着这样的消息：美国迫于西欧国家在会内、会外要求同苏联谈判和反对在它们的领土上建立核导弹基地的强大压力，不得不勉强同意通过外交途径来“试探”苏联的态度，同时又以此作为交换条件，来迫使它的盟国为原子备战作出牺牲。
    据各方面报道，要实际执行上述“原则性”协议，还必须由有关国家分别同美国进行双边谈判和缔结具体的协定。有消息说，挪威和丹麦已经表明，它们仍然反对在它们的领土上建立导弹基地和核武器储存库，虽然总的说来并不反对在西欧这样做。目前，除英国已经同美国谈妥可以在英国建立四个中程导弹基地外，北大西洋集团其他成员国中，只有荷兰和土耳其明白表示愿意让美国建立这种基地。
    观察家指出，美国的导弹基地计划进展得这样缓慢，这是艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯原先没有预料到的。
    据透露，18日的会议还就建立北大西洋集团的“均衡的集体部队”（特别是在海军、空防和后勤方面）问题达成了“原则上”的协议。关于武器的研究、发展和生产方面进行合作的问题，也达成了协议，据说为此将成立一个“大西洋科学委员会”和任命“科学顾问”。此外，在经济合作问题上，据说已经决定成立一个特别机构来援助集团中较落后的国家。
    据报道，北大西洋集团政府首脑会议最后公报的起草工作在18日加紧进行。参加起草工作的比利时外交大臣拉罗克在18日晚上政府首脑会议结束后表示，曾经在17日会议上占去大部分时间的关于谋求恢复同苏联的裁军谈判的问题，仍有待于在19日上午十五国政府首脑们的最后会议上“取得一致意见”。
    此外，据北大西洋集团秘书长斯巴克透露，关于这个集团同其他军事集团的联系问题，也是“争执很多的问题”之一。在这个问题上，美国所支持的一个建议要求这些军事集团经常交换情报和工作文件。但是，外交观察家指出，离中东较远的一些北大西洋集团成员国，例如挪威、丹麦和加拿大，对建立联系并不热心。
