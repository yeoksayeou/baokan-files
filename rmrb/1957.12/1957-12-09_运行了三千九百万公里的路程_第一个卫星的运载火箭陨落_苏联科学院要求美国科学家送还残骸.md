    Having Traveled 39 Million Kilometers
　　The First Satellite's Carrier Rocket Falls
    Soviet Academy of Sciences Requests US Scientists Return the Remains

    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th. TASS, Moscow, 7th: The Soviet Academy of Sciences has issued a statement to American scientists, requesting them to return the remains of the carrier rocket of the Soviet Union's first artificial satellite, which fell in Alaska and along the west coast of North America, to the Soviet Union.

    The statement said: Analyzing and studying the remains of the carrier rocket that have not been completely burned, as well as determining the location of its fall, is of great scientific significance, because it can allow us to obtain valuable materials about the phenomena that occur when artificial Earth satellites enter the dense atmosphere.

    The Soviet Academy of Sciences requests that American scientists report materials about the location where the remains of the carrier rocket of the first artificial Earth satellite fell, and send all the remains of the carrier rocket that can be found to the Soviet Academy of Sciences.

    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th. TASS, Moscow, 7th: The carrier rocket of the Soviet Union's first artificial satellite, which had orbited the Earth for fifty-eight days, descended sharply on December 1st, entered the dense atmosphere, and then burned and fell, with the remains landing in Alaska and along the west coast of North America. This was determined by Soviet scientists based on observational data.

    The carrier rocket began to descend significantly around midnight on November 30th, and the time it took to orbit the Earth quickly shortened. On December 1st, when it was traveling along the route of Irkutsk, the Chukchi Peninsula, Alaska, and the west coast of North America, it descended so significantly that it fell.

    The carrier rocket of the Soviet Union's first artificial satellite traveled a total of 39 million kilometers. Its initial orbit around the Earth took 96.2 minutes, with a peak altitude of approximately 900 kilometers.

    运行了三千九百万公里的路程
　　第一个卫星的运载火箭陨落
    苏联科学院要求美国科学家送还残骸
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科7日讯：苏联科学院向美国科学家发表了一个声明，要求他们把陨落在阿拉斯加和北美洲西岸路线上的苏联第一个人造卫星的运载火箭的残骸送还苏联。
    声明说：对尚未完全烧毁的运载火箭的残骸进行分析和研究，以及断定它坠落的地点，都具有重大的科学意义，因为这可以使我们得到关于人造地球卫星在进入大气稠密层时所发生的现象的宝贵材料。
    苏联科学院请求美国科学家报告关于第一个人造地球卫星的运载火箭的残骸坠落地点的材料，并且把将能找到的全部运载火箭的残骸寄给苏联科学院。
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科7日讯：已经绕地球飞行了五十八天的苏联第一个人造卫星的运载火箭，12月1日猛烈下降，进入稠密的大气层，随后即燃烧陨落，残骸落在阿拉斯加和北美洲西海岸地方。这是苏联科学家根据观测资料确定的。
    运载火箭于11月30日午夜时分开始显著下降，绕地球运行一周的时间很快缩短。12月1日，当它沿伊尔库次克、楚克奇半岛、阿拉斯加和北美洲西海岸路线运行的时候，特别显著地下降以致陨落。
    苏联第一个人造卫星的运载火箭一共运行了三千九百万公里的路程。它最初绕地球运行一周的时间是九十六点二分钟，顶点高度约九百公里。
