    Good News from My Hometown, Painful Memories
    To the Editor:

    When I saw the front page of the People's Daily on November 15th, "The People of Jiyuan and Meng Counties Fight Tirelessly for Years, Taming the Mang River, Benefiting Ten Thousand People," and the full-page report on page two, I was unable to find suitable words to express my feelings. Surprise, sorrow, gratitude. I read the entire report in one breath, and then read it several more times. That night, I could hardly sleep, because the report reminded me of painful past events, and I repeatedly thought about the beautiful and happy future that is coming.

    My home is located in a village south of the tamed Mang River in Jiyuan County. There were only my mother and I in the family. Before liberation, we only had half a mu of land, and our livelihood depended entirely on my mother's weaving.

    Jiyuan is a place that often suffers from disasters, especially droughts. As the report said, it is often "nine droughts in ten years, disasters every year." In 1942 and 1943, there were consecutive years of severe drought, and the grain harvest was poor. Most of the farmers in the county left their homes and fled to other places. My mother and I also fled to my uncle's house. Although I was only ten years old at the time, and we ate wheat bran mixed with wild vegetables that was so thin you could see your reflection, in order to survive, I had to grind wheat into flour with my mother every night, and then steam the flour into steamed buns during the day to sell in Guanzhuang, a small town close to the Mang River. At that time, in order to survive, I don't know how many people in the town had to rely on snatching buns and grabbing food to stay alive. I personally witnessed countless such situations: someone would just buy a steamed bun or a bowl of rice, and if they weren't careful, it would be snatched away. The person snatching would turn around and run while eating, and the person who was robbed would chase after them. Because the people grabbing the buns were mostly so hungry that they were just skin and bones, they were often caught and beaten with fists and feet, often beaten until their heads were bleeding, but they still wouldn't let go of what they had grabbed, and would keep stuffing it into their mouths, because if they didn't, they would only starve to death. I was young and weak, and it was very dangerous to sell things there, so I had to sell them near my village where there were more passersby. But even there, things could not be avoided.

    It was one afternoon in the eleventh month of the lunar calendar. The weather was gloomy, the piercing northwest wind was howling, and snowflakes were flying in the wind. The sun was about to set, and I hadn't sold all my steamed buns yet. I was just about to go home when a man in his thirties came from the east, his face as thin as a monkey's, leaning on a stick. He asked for several steamed buns to eat, but he didn't pay for them. I grabbed his clothes and wouldn't let go, demanding that he pay. Then he suddenly said, "Okay, come with me to my house to get the money." I believed him and he tricked me into a secluded place, taking the opportunity to run away. I wouldn't let him go. At that moment, he raised the stick in his hand and hit me on the head. With a "thud," I fell to the ground, and the steamed buns rolled all over. By the time I woke up, my mother and neighbors had found me and carried me home.

    After this happened, my mother never let me sell steamed buns alone in places with few people. At the same time, because puppet soldiers and bandits often ate steamed buns without paying, and the steamed buns were often snatched away, the capital of two dou of wheat was lost, and we had to stop this small business.

    Life was even harder at this time. Every day, my mother and I went to the fields to pull wild vegetables, dig grass roots, and peel tree bark to eat. But wasn't everyone doing the same thing? So the grass roots and tree bark were quickly eaten up. Later, we went to pull up some wheat seedlings, and even picked up goose droppings (undigested wheat seedlings) to make into cakes to eat.

    We were on the verge of starvation. In desperation, my aunt advised my mother to remarry and find a way to survive. In that man-eating society, who would ask a question or offer a helping hand! Even our closest relatives and friends were powerless, because everyone's fate was no different.

    Looking back now, it's truly terrifying. That year, my mother and I almost froze and starved to death. In those years, I don't know how many people on both sides of the Mang River were walking on the road and couldn't walk anymore, and just fell in the snow and froze and starved to death. Even those who fled to other places did not avoid the danger of hunger and death.

    The Party has brought me happiness. Last year, my hometown established an advanced agricultural cooperative, and my mother also joined the cooperative. Last September, I went home once, and my hometown had completely changed. My mother, who is nearly fifty years old, earns enough work points in a year to live a decent life, and the days of suffering are gone forever.

    When I saw the good news from my hometown—Jiyuan—in the newspaper, I felt indescribable joy and excitement. Seeing its changes with my own eyes in the place where I grew up, how could I not be grateful to the Communist Party from the bottom of my heart? I want to use my personal experience and the ironclad facts I have seen with my own eyes once again to refute the right-wingers' fallacy of "the present is not as good as the past"!

### 故乡的喜讯　痛苦的回忆

    故乡的喜讯　痛苦的回忆编辑同志：
    当我看到11月15日人民日报头版“济源、孟县广大人民连年奋战，漭河驯服，万民受益，”及二版的整版报道之后，我的心情是难以找到适当的词汇来表达的。惊喜、悲痛、感激。我一口气看完了这一报道，并且接着又看了几遍。这天晚上，我几乎通宵都不能入睡，因为这一报道使我回忆起惨痛的往事，也反复地想着即将到来的美好幸福的未来。
    我的家就住在济源县内那条被驯服了的漭河南面的一个村庄里。家里只有我和母亲两口人。解放前只有半亩地，生活全靠母亲纺织维持。
    济源这块地方，是常常闹灾荒的，特别是旱灾，正像报道中所说的，经常是“十年九旱，年年有灾”，1942、1943连年大旱，五谷欠收。全县的农民大部分都背井离乡逃往他乡。我和妈妈也逃到舅舅家，当时我虽只有十岁，天天吃的又是能照出人影的麦麩加野菜饭，但为了活命也不得不在每天晚上与母亲一起把麦推成面，白天再把面蒸成馍，拿到紧靠漭河的官庄小镇上去卖。那时，为了活命，镇上也不知有多少人不得不靠抢馍抓饭来维持生命。我亲眼看到不知有多少次这样的情形：一个人刚买了一个馒头或一碗饭，一不小心就会被人抢去。抢的人扭回头就一面跑一面吃，被抢的就追。因抓馍的人，大都是饿得只剩一把骨头，所以常又被人追上，拳打脚踢，常被打得头破血流，抓去的东西也不肯放，还直往嘴里塞，因为不这样他们也只有饿死。我年小无力，在那里卖东西是很危险的，因此，只好到我居住的村旁过路人多的地方去卖。那也不能避免事情发生。
    那是在旧历11月的一天下午。天气阴沉沉的，刺骨的西北风呼呼地吹着，雪花随风飘着。太阳快落山了，我的馍还未卖完。我正打算回家，这时，从东方来了一个三十多岁的男子，脸瘦得像猴子一样，拄着一根棍，要了几个馒头吃，吃了不给钱，我拉住他衣服不放，要他给钱。后来他忽然说：“好吧，跟我到家去取。”我信以为真，他把我骗到一个僻静的地方，乘机要跑，我那里肯放他。这时他举起手中的棍向我头上打来。“哄”的一下，我昏倒在地上，馒头滚了一地，等我醒来时，已被妈妈和邻居找到抱回家了。
    这事发生后，妈妈再不叫我一个人在人少的地方卖馍了，同时由于伪军土匪常吃馍不给钱，馍也常叫人抢去，二斗麦的本钱就赔干了，也只得停止了这个小生意。
    这时的生活就更苦。每天我和妈妈到野外去拔野菜、挖草根、剥树皮回来吃。但哪家不是这样呢？所以草根树皮也就很快吃光了。以后就去拔些麦苗，甚至把雁粪（未消化的麦苗）拾回来作成饼吃。
    眼看就要饿死了。在无可奈何的情况下，老姨劝妈妈改嫁，找条活路。在那样吃人的社会里，有谁来问一声，帮一帮忙呢！就连自己最近的亲友也无能为力，因为大家命运并没有两样。
    现在回想起来真可怕，那一年我和妈妈就差一点冻饿死。在那个年头，漭河两岸的人民不知有多少人就在路上走着走着走不动了，就倒在雪里冻饿而死。就是逃在外乡的人，也并没有避免饥饿和死亡的危险。
    党给我带来了幸福，去年我的故乡成立了高级农业社，妈妈也入社了。去年9月我回了一次家，我的家乡完全变了样。年近半百的妈妈，一年劳动所得的工分足够她过一般还不算低的生活，苦难的日子一去不复返了。
    当我在报上看到了我的故乡——济源的喜讯时，真是说不出的喜悦和激动，在我生长的地方亲眼看到它的变化，怎能不从心眼里感激共产党呢？我要再一次用我亲身的经历和亲眼所见的铁的事实来驳斥右派分子“今不如昔”的谬论！北京市阜城门外社会路六号　赵宗仁
