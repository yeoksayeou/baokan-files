Let's Eliminate "Blind Letters"
Sun Zhiping, Postal Department, General Post Office of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications

The Beijing Post Office handles an average of about 1,800 "blind letters" every day, letters for which the address cannot be found:

	The first category: Large organizations have affiliated institutions all over the country, but the senders are unwilling to write the address clearly. For example, "Petroleum Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences"—do you think it's in Beijing? No, it's in Dalian; "642 Team of the North China Geological Bureau"—it's hard to tell that it's in Tongguan, Shaanxi. As a result, a letter from Guangzhou addressed to the "Fifth Exploration Team of the Fourth Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways" had to go to Beijing and then back to Wuhan; an official document from Nanjing addressed to the "Third Engineering Team of the Long-Distance Line of the Engineering Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications" went to Beijing and then back to Shanghai.

	The second category: After the socialist transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises and handicrafts in various places, most of them abolished their names and only retained their numbers. The correspondence has numbers but no addresses. For example, "Service Department No. 93 of the Beijing No. 64 Sewing Production Cooperative" has to be searched everywhere. Taking Beijing cooperatives alone, there are countless numbering for sewing, binding, woodwork, bicycle, cotton weaving, clocks and watches, printing, sheet metal, bamboo and willow rattan grass, shoemaking, hardware, and paper boxes. It is quite a difficulty to ask the postal sorters and delivery personnel to memorize the addresses of these numbered cooperatives.

	The third category: Some people's correspondence has place names but no detailed and accurate addresses, such as "No. ×× Biandan Hutong, Beijing" and "No. ×× Chuantangmen, Beijing." There are as many as fourteen Biandan Hutongs and Chuantangmens in Beijing City. Which one should be delivered to? There are three thousand three hundred and forty-two streets and alleys of all sizes in Beijing City, including five hundred and forty-three duplicate place names (not including the two thousand six hundred and twenty-two place names outside the city). Is it possible to not write a clear and accurate address?

	There are also many duplicate house numbers, such as 1-26 on the south end of Fuyou Street in Beijing, and 1-26 on the north end; there are fifty-four duplicate numbers on Zhao Dengyu Road, and one hundred and sixty-one duplicate numbers on Zhengyangmen Street.

	The fourth category: Unprincipled simplification and sloppiness. Can you guess that "Ji Bai Jing Zhan" is "Hebei Provincial Department Store Beijing Wholesale Station"? There are also similar shapes and sloppy writing, such as "Beijing National Defense Club" and "Beijing International Club," "Beijing Taijichang" and "Beipiao Taiji Mine," and "No. 8 House Number" and "No. 11 House Number" are easily confused.

For this reason, post offices across the country have wasted a lot of manpower and time to inquire and investigate everywhere, delaying the affairs of many people. Although Beijing Post Office has produced labor heroes like Luo Shuzhen who can deliver 880,000 letters without errors, it is impossible to fundamentally solve the problem by having a few, dozens, or hundreds more labor heroes to eliminate so many "blind letters." Therefore, I suggest that in order for your letters to be delivered quickly, accurately, and safely, please be sure to write your mailing address clearly. Let us work together to eliminate "blind letters"! Spending a few more seconds writing the envelope can save countless manpower and resources for the entire postal and telecommunications industry!

### 大家来消灭“瞎信”

    大家来消灭“瞎信”
    邮电部邮政总局  孙志平
    北京邮局平均每天约有一千八百件“瞎信”，找不到地址：
    第一类：是大机关附属机构遍布全国，可是写信人却不愿写清地名，如“中国科学院石油研究所”，你以为它在北京吗？不然，它在大连；“华北地质局642队”，你很难看出它在陕西的潼关。结果就有由广州寄“铁道部第四设计院第五勘察队”的信，不得不跑到北京，再回到武汉；由南京寄“邮电部工程管理局长途线路第三工程总队”的公文，到了北京，再回到上海。
    第二类：是各地私营工商业和手工业社会主义改造后，大都废名存号，来往通信，有号码无地址，如“北京第六十四缝纫生产合作社第九十三服务部”就得到处寻找。单以北京合作社而论，就有缝纫、装订、木器、自行车、棉织、钟表、印刷、黑白铁、竹柳藤草、制鞋、五金、纸盒……数不尽的编号，若叫邮局分拣员、投递员都能熟记这些编号合作社地址，实在是个不算小的困难。
    第三类：是有些人通信，有地名没详细准确地址，如“北京扁担胡同××号”“北京穿堂门××号”，北京城内扁担胡同、穿堂门就各有十四个之多，究竟该投那一家呢？北京城内大小街道胡同三千三百四十二个，其中两个以上的重复地名就有五百四十三个，（城外还有二千六百二十二个地名不计在内）难道不写清详细准确的地址能行吗？
    重复门牌也不少，如北京府右街南头有1—26号，北头又有1—26号；赵登禹路有五十四个重号，正阳门大街有一百六十一个重号。
    第四类：是无原则的简化和潦草，如“冀百京站”你能猜到是“河北省百货公司驻京批发站”吗？还有字形相似，写法潦草的如“北京国防俱乐部”与“北京国际俱乐部”“北京台基厂”与“北票台基矿”，“门牌八号”与“门牌11号”都易混淆。
    为此，全国各地邮局，不知浪费了多少人力和时间来到处探听调查，耽误了多少人的事情，虽然像北京邮局出现了投递八十八万件信无差错的劳动英雄罗淑珍等等能干的投递员，可是要想消灭这么多的“瞎信”，再来几个、几十个、几百个劳动英雄也不可能根本解决问题。因此，我向大家建议，为了你们的信件能迅速准确安全投递，请您通信一定要把通信地址写得清清楚楚。让我们大家一起动手，来消灭“瞎信”吧。每个人在写信封时多花几秒钟时间，就能为整个邮电事业节省下数不清的人力和物力！
