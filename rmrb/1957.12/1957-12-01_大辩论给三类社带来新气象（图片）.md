The Great Debate Brings a New Atmosphere to Third-Category Cooperatives
    Jingshan Agricultural Cooperative in Qingshui Township, Wuhu County, Anhui Province, was formerly a third-category cooperative. After the socialist great debate and rectification of the cooperative, the enthusiasm of the members for production has greatly increased. This is a scene of members collectively reclaiming wasteland.
