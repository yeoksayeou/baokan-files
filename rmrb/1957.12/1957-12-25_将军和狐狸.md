    The General and the Fox
    Some European countries refused to accept the US medium-range missiles, and American newspapers believe that this was a "thorough defeat" for the United States at the Paris meeting. However, the US General in charge of these missiles, the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Group Army, Norstad, self-deprecatingly said: "From a military point of view, it is not necessary for every country to have such missiles. ... It is no good to set them (missiles) in places that are politically unacceptable and cannot play a military role."
    This general is just like the fox in Aesop's fables who couldn't get the grapes. According to him, the "defeat" suffered by the United States at the Paris meeting seems to be a good thing for the United States' plan to expand its arms race.

    将军和狐狸
    一些欧洲国家拒绝接受美国的中程导弹，美国报纸认为这是美国在巴黎会议上“地道地吃了败仗”。然而，负责掌管这种导弹的美国将军、北大西洋集团军队最高统帅诺斯塔德却自我解嘲地说：“从军事观点来看，并不需要每个国家都有这种导弹。……把它们（导弹）设置在那些政治上不被接受、在军事上不能发挥作用的地方是没有好处的。”
    这位将军真像是伊索寓言里的那个吃不到葡萄的狐狸，因为按照他的说法，美国在巴黎会议上吃的“败仗”，对于美国的扩军备战的计划倒好像是一件好事了。
