    — A Record of a Debate Among Residents of Dazhigu Street, Tianjin, on the Issue of Planned Grain Supply

    "Not knowing the bitterness of the past, one cannot know the sweetness of today." This is the conclusion reached by residents of Dazhigu Street in Tianjin after a debate on the planned grain supply during the socialist education movement.
    The two residents' committees of Dazhigu Street, with over 1,100 households, put forward more than 1,400 opinions related to planned supply during the "blooming and contending" period initiated by the Communist Party. Some people here were clamoring that there was not enough grain to eat. Resident Committee member Hao Shuzhen said, "My family has eight people, and we are short of grain for two days a month. Can we just save and not eat?" Housewife Zhang Keru said, "I stayed at my mother's house for half a month last month, and only then did we have enough grain to eat." There were many similar statements. Was there enough grain or not? The cadres conducted an investigation in Liangjia Hutong, where the most complaints about insufficient grain were heard. The investigation revealed that 23 out of 25 households had enough or even a surplus. The four households that complained the loudest included: one household with six people, a ration of 162.5 jin, where four people exceeded the standard, making them a surplus household; another household with nine people, four adults and five children, a ration of 257 jin, which was completely sufficient each month. Only two families were short one or two days a month because the grain rations had not been adjusted in time as the children grew older.
    After everyone carefully calculated the accounts, one thing was clarified: the vast majority of families had enough grain. However, why were some people still clamoring that there was not enough grain? The masses themselves analyzed five reasons: first, there was no plan for eating grain. Ma Xiuying had two children, and every time the children cried or made a fuss, she would casually give them a piece of cake. Over time, the children became accustomed to it, and this situation was very common. Second, raising chickens and ducks. Qin Shuzhen raised four or five chickens, which required 20 jin of grain a month. Some even raised 14 chickens and still complained that there was not enough grain. Raising chickens and ducks in the city not only affected hygiene and public order but also wasted grain. Third, not collecting grain coupons when relatives and friends came to eat. A relative stayed at Ma Yinglan's house for more than ten months without grain coupons, and this family also complained that there was not enough grain. Fourth, wanting to keep something in reserve, accumulating more grain coupons to exchange for fine grains, or even wanting to save more grain coupons, this thinking was also very common. Fifth, grain rations were not adjusted as children grew older.
    After clarifying the question of whether there was enough grain, everyone started a debate on the issue of "Is planned supply good or not?" During the "blooming and contending" period, because some people complained that there was not enough grain, they thought that planned supply was inconvenient. Some said, "Socialism should mean that you can buy anything you want, without quantity restrictions. If you have money, you can buy whatever you want." Some even said, "We finally looked forward to a good life, but there are still limits on what we can buy." These views were opposed by people at the debate. Wang Zhenhua, an elderly woman in her sixties, said very excitedly, "In the old society, the hungry died of starvation, and the full were stuffed. Big merchants and capitalists ate well and dressed well, and we poor people had nothing. Now everyone has food and clothing, so how can you say planned supply is not good?" Old Granny Wang Yuping mentioned the starvation deaths of her two sons in the old society at the meeting, and couldn't help but shed tears. She said, "Now that we have planned supply, everyone can buy grain and eat their fill." Old Granny Zhao Huifen also mentioned that once before liberation, she asked her daughter to take 40,000 yuan in puppet currency to buy corn flour. At that time, she could buy four jin, but by the time she finished lining up, the price had risen to 20,000 yuan per jin, and she only bought two jin. She said, "In the past, prices changed eight times a day. Now, prices don't go up for years. This is all thanks to Chairman Mao's leadership!" Some people said, "With planned supply, prices are more stable." The painful memories of the elderly also educated the young people. When the question of "Can we do without planned supply?" was raised at the meeting, young woman Ma Yinglan immediately said, "That won't do. The profiteers will speculate and hoard again."
    "Not knowing the bitterness of the past, one cannot know the sweetness of today." This debate was also a class education on the two different paths of the new and old societies. Housewife Zhao Guilan said, "The country is building itself through diligence and thrift, and we must also live well through frugality. This is also our contribution as housewives to socialist construction." Granny Su Runqing and her fifteen-year-old son had a monthly grain ration of 59 jin. In the past, she always thought it was not enough. Now she has made a plan for the grain she eats every day: eat more steamed buns made from fermented dough and less flatbreads made from unleavened dough, and she can save ten liang of flour a day; eat cabbage porridge with salted vegetables every other day, which is both delicious and saves rice. With such careful calculations, there is enough grain. In the past, young housewife Liu Guizhen always envied others for their good clothes and food and complained that her husband didn't earn enough money. Sometimes, she couldn't help but argue with her husband. She made a self-criticism at the debate, saying, "Before, I always wanted to have whatever I wanted. This time, my thinking is straightened out. Not only will I not complain, but I will also be frugal and live well." Ma Fengyun's family of three had a high income but ate and drank extravagantly and didn't know how to manage their lives, leaving them with no money left at the end of each month. She also told her neighbors at the debate that she was determined to be frugal.

    “不受过去苦，不知今日甜”
    ——记天津大直沽街居民关于粮食计划供应问题的辩论
    新华社记者　朱泽民
    “不受过去苦，不知今日甜”，这是天津市大直沽街的居民在社会主义教育运动中，经过了一场对粮食计划供应的辩论以后得出的结论。
    大直沽街的两个居民委员会一千一百多户人家，在鸣放中共提出一千四百多条有关计划供应方面的意见。这里有一些人叫喊粮食不够吃。居民委员郝淑珍说：“我家八口，一个月差两天的粮食，光节约不吃饭行吗？”家庭妇女张克茹说：“我上月到娘家住了半月，粮食才够吃了。”类似这样的说法不少。到底粮食够吃不够吃？干部们在闹不够吃最多的梁家胡同作了一个调查。调查结果，二十五户中有二十三户都够吃甚至有余。叫喊不够吃最凶的有四户：其中一户全家六口，定量一百六十二斤半，有四口人都超过了标准，是个余粮户；另一户九口人，大人四口，小孩五口，定量二百五十七斤，每月完全够吃。只有两家因为小孩长大了，粮食定量没有及时调整，所以每月差一两天。
    经过大家算细账，首先明确了一个问题：绝大部分人家粮食都够吃。但是，为什么还有小部分人叫嚷粮食不够吃呢？群众自己分析出有五个原因：第一是吃粮食没计划。马秀英有两个小孩，每次孩子一哭一闹，顺手就给一块饼，日子长了，小孩都成了习惯，这种情况非常普遍。第二是养鸡鸭。秦淑珍养了四、五只鸡，一月就要二十斤粮，有的甚至养十四只鸡也喊粮食不够吃。在城市中养鸡鸭，不但影响卫生和公共秩序，而且浪费粮食。第三是亲戚朋友来吃饭不收粮票。马英兰家来了一个亲戚，一住十个多月没有粮票，这家也喊粮食不够吃。第四是想留后手，多积点粮票换细粮吃，甚至想多存点粮票，这种思想也很普遍。第五是小孩长大了，粮食定量没有调整。
    粮食够吃不够吃的问题明确以后，大家就围绕“计划供应好不好”问题展开了辩论。在鸣放的时候，由于有些人喊粮食不够吃，就认为计划供应不方便，有的说：“社会主义就应该买什么有什么，不限制数量，有钱就可以随便买。”有的甚至说：“好容易盼着过好日子，买东西又都有个数。”这些看法在辩论会上受到了人们的反对。六十多岁的老太太王振华十分激动地说：“旧社会饿的饿死，饱的饱死，大奸商大资本家吃好的穿好的，没有咱穷人的分，现在谁都有吃有穿，怎么能说计划供应不好呢？”王玉萍老大娘在会上提起旧社会里两个儿子饿死的事，止不住掉下眼泪，她说：“现在有了计划供应，大家都能买到粮食，都能吃饱饭了。”赵慧芬老大娘也提到，解放前有一次，她让女儿拿着四万元伪币去买玉米面，当时能买四斤，可是一排队的功夫就涨到两万元一斤，结果只买了两斤。她说：“过去东西一天八个价，现在成年也不涨钱，这都是毛主席领导的好哇！”有的人就说：“实行了计划供应，物价更稳定了。”老人们的痛苦回忆也教育了青年人，在会上一提起“不计划供应行不行？”青年妇女马英兰立刻说：“那可不行，奸商又要投机倒把了”。
    “不受过去苦，不知今日甜”，经过了一场辩论，也是一场新旧社会两条不同道路的阶级教育。家庭妇女赵桂兰说：“国家是勤俭建国，咱们也要省吃俭用把日子过好，这也是咱家庭妇女对社会主义建设起了作用。”苏润卿大娘和一个十五岁儿子，两人每月粮食定量是五十九斤，过去总嫌不够，现在她把每天吃的粮食订了个计划：多吃发面馒头，少吃死面烙饼，一天就能省十两面；每隔两天吃一次白菜熬咸饭，又好吃，又省米，这样一精打细算，粮食就够吃了。青年家庭妇女刘桂珍过去总羡慕别人吃穿好，嫌丈夫赚钱少，有时不免要和丈夫吵架拌嘴。她在辩论会上自己检讨说：“以前我总想吃什么有什么，这回我思想搞通了，不但不抱怨，还要好好节约，把日子过好。”马凤云一家三口人，收入多，可是大吃大喝，不会过日子，月月一个钱不剩。她在辩论会上也对邻居们表示，要下决心节约。
