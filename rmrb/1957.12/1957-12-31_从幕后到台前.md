    Notes

    From Behind the Scenes to Center Stage
    The U.S. State Department announced that Dulles is preparing to lead an "observer delegation" to attend the Baghdad Pact Ministerial Council meeting to be held at the end of January next year.
    The United States is not a formal member of the Baghdad Pact, so why does the Secretary of State have to travel such a long distance?
    Dulles clearly saw that the Baghdad Group was becoming increasingly loose, so he ignored his identity as a director and suddenly ran from behind the scenes to the front stage. However, when an ugly drama has been performed to the point where people don't want to watch it, what effect will the director's appearance have? Of course, it will only become uglier.

    从幕后到台前
    美国国务院宣布，杜勒斯准备率领“观察员代表团”，出席明年1月底召开的巴格达条约部长理事会会议。
    美国并不是巴格达条约的正式成员，何劳堂堂的国务卿长途奔波呢？
    杜勒斯显然是看到巴格达集团内部越来越松劲儿了，于是，他竟不顾他的导演者的身份，突然从幕后跑到台前。然而，当一场丑戏已经演得人家都不想看的时候，导演出场又会有什么作用呢？当然只会丑上加丑。
