    Who Feeds Whom
    The spokesmen for American monopoly capital often say that if underdeveloped countries were to leave the United States, they would have no way to survive. But the truth is quite the opposite.
    Not long ago, the "New York Times" admitted that among thirty major mineral raw materials, the United States could only supply itself with magnesium and molybdenum, and the remaining twenty-eight were plundered from underdeveloped countries. It wrote: "We get copper from Africa and South America, tin from the Far East and Bolivia. Oil comes from northern South America and the Middle East, iron ore from Liberia and Labrador…."
    Who exactly feeds whom? This is very clear. Without the plunder of underdeveloped countries, the American monopoly capitalist groups would not be able to survive.

    谁养活谁
    美国垄断资本的代言人经常说，不发达国家若是离开了美国，似乎就没有办法生活。但，事实却正好相反。
    不久以前，“纽约时报”承认，在三十种主要矿产原料中，美国能够自给的仅有镁和钼，其余二十八种多是从不发达国家掠夺来的。它写道：“我们从非洲和南美洲获得铜，从远东和玻利维亚获得锡。石油来自南美洲北部和中东，铁砂来自利比里亚和拉布拉达……。”
    究竟谁养活谁？这是很清楚的。没有对不发达国家的掠夺，美国垄断资本集团是活不下去的。
