　　Diet for Scarlet Fever Patients

　　The diet of scarlet fever patients should be adjusted according to the changes in their condition during different stages of the illness. In the early stages of the illness, when patients have symptoms such as high fever, vomiting, sore throat, headache, and swollen cervical lymph nodes, they should be given liquid foods, such as hawthorn juice, orange juice, lotus root powder, rice soup, honey water, vegetable juice, wheat bran soup, etc. These foods contain sufficient vitamin C and carbohydrates. It is advisable to have six meals a day.

　　When the patient's toxic symptoms lessen, semi-liquid foods can be given, such as mashed potatoes, carrot puree, boiled sweet potatoes, porridge, biscuits, thin noodles, as well as fruit juice, vegetable juice, and other foods. Avoid eating fried foods.

　　In the third week after the onset of the illness, kidney disease often occurs. At this time, avoid eating stimulating foods, such as scallions, spinach, celery, radishes, meat broth, and chicken soup; it is not advisable to give patients foods containing protein, and the diet should be salt-free. Patients can be given noodles, well-cooked rice, bread, rusks, non-alkaline steamed buns, cabbage, potatoes, carrots, squash, winter melon, and a small amount of milk.

　　When the patient's body temperature drops, the sore throat and swollen lymph nodes disappear, and the appetite increases significantly, attention should be paid to providing sufficient amounts of protein, minerals, and vitamins. Generally speaking, patients in the recovery period need 100-150 grams of protein per day (approximately 3.2-4.8 taels).

　　Here is a sample menu for a patient in the recovery period:

　　8:00 AM　Soy milk (or milk), steamed bun, peanut butter, sweet potato porridge

　　12:00 PM　Steamed egg, braised tofu with spinach, rice or steamed bun

　　4:00 PM　Fruit juice (or vegetable juice), biscuits

　　6:00 PM　Braised fish balls with carrots, dried shrimp with cabbage, rice (or steamed bun).

　　Note: If economic conditions permit, two eggs can be added to breakfast, and meat and fruit can be added to lunch and dinner.

　　猩红热病人的饮食
    猩红热的患者，由于病情的变化，各个时期的饮食也应随着调配。在患病初期，患者有高烧、呕吐、咽痛、头痛、颈淋巴肿大等症状，应该采用流质状的食物。 如山渣水、橘子汁、冲藕粉、米汤、蜂蜜水、蔬菜汁、麦麸汤等，这些食物中含有足够的维生素丙和醣。每日以进餐六次为宜。
    当患者中毒症状减轻，这时可给予流质和半流质状的食物，如土豆泥、葫萝卜泥、煮白薯、粥、饼干、细面条，以及果汁、蔬菜汁等食物，切忌吃油炸、油煎的食物。
    在患病后第三个星期，常常容易并发肾脏的疾病，这时在饮食中应避免食用刺激性的食物，如葱、菠菜、芹菜、小红萝卜、肉汤、鸡汤等；不宜给病人吃含有蛋白质的食物，应该让病人吃无盐的饮食。可给予面条、烂饭、饼、面包干、无碱的馒头，白菜、土豆、葫萝卜、南瓜、冬瓜及少量牛奶等食物。
    当病人体温下降，咽痛和淋巴肿大等现象消失，食欲显著增加的时候，应注意给予足够量的蛋白质、矿物质和维生素。一般的说，恢复期的患者每天需要蛋白质100—150克（约合3.2—4.8市两）
    这里列举的，是恢复期病人一天的食谱：
    八时　豆浆（或牛奶）、馒头、花生酱、白薯煮稀饭
    十二时　蒸鸡子、烧豆腐菠菜、米饭或馒头
    四时　果汁（或蔬菜汁）、饼干
    六时　烩鱼丸子加葫萝卜、海米烧大白菜、米饭（或馒头）。
    注：若经济条件许可，早饭可以加鸡蛋二个、午饭和晚饭可加肉和水果等食物。
