How Dutch Colonialists Invaded Indonesia
Wu Shihuang
    The Dutch colonialists' 360-year invasion of Indonesia "presents a picture of treachery, bribery, massacre, and baseness"①; on the other hand, the Indonesian people's heroic struggle against Dutch aggression has written countless magnificent poems.
    Spice Monopoly
    The Netherlands was "the model capitalist country of the seventeenth century"②. During the period of primitive capital accumulation, it used the plunder of Indonesian spices (mainly pepper, cloves, and nutmeg) as one of its main means of obtaining profits. In 1596, Dutch merchant ships first arrived at Javanese ports, competing with the old colonial power, Portugal, for spices. In order to strengthen its competitive power against Portugal, several Dutch trading companies merged in 1602 to form the East India Company. It obtained from the Dutch Parliament the exclusive right to trade in Indonesia, and also acquired the special powers to recruit troops, build forts, issue currency, appoint officials, and conclude treaties with foreign countries on behalf of the Dutch Parliament. The East India Company thus possessed the power of a "state."
    After the establishment of the East India Company, it seized several bases in the spice-producing center of the Moluccas Islands by using violence and exploiting the contradictions between the feudal lords on the islands, and launched fierce battles with Portugal. As a result of the struggle, Portuguese power was expelled, and the Netherlands took control of the monopoly of spice sales. The East India Company set the purchase price of spices very low, forcing the Moluccan residents to sell spices to it at the specified price, under penalty of "death without pardon." In 1621, the residents of Banda Island were massacred for resisting this unreasonable regulation, and almost all the residents of the island were killed. When the supply of Indonesian spices in the European market sometimes exceeded demand, and prices fell, the East India Company immediately dispatched a large number of speedboats to various islands to cut down privately planted spice trees, reducing production and raising prices. This cruel exploitation and oppression by the East India Company aroused constant uprisings among the Moluccan residents, the most famous of which was the uprising led by Pattimura in 1817, which dealt a heavy blow to the Dutch colonialists.
    Shortly after establishing a base in the Moluccas, the East India Company occupied Jakarta in 1619 as a base for invading Indonesia, squeezed out British power in Java, and expanded its power and seized territory by exploiting the contradictions between the two kingdoms on Java Island: Mataram and Banten. Jan Pieterszoon Coen, the head of the Dutch invasion, once stipulated a colonial policy, saying: "The only correct policy is to incite one kingdom against another... not to let Banten become too weak, nor to let Mataram become too strong."
    The East India Company implemented a compulsory supply system in Java to exploit the Indonesian people. It forcibly stipulated the types and quantities of crops that residents within its sphere of influence had to pay, so that Indonesian crops served exports and developed in a one-sided and deformed direction.
    In addition to seizing the fruits of the Indonesian farmers' labor, the East India Company also shipped large quantities of opium from India every year to poison the Indonesian people. In addition, it looted Indonesian people everywhere as slaves, and shipped large numbers of slaves from Bali to Jakarta every year to do hard labor. Marx pointed out in "Das Kapital": "In order to obtain slaves for use in Java, the Dutch practiced a kind of kidnapping system in Celebes (now Sulawesi - author), and trained a group of kidnappers for this purpose."③ Then Marx pointed out: Due to the Dutch colonialists' cruel exploitation, "Wherever they went, desolation and population extinction occurred immediately. In Bungwanggi, Java, in 1750, there were more than 80,000 residents, but in 1811, only 8,000 people were left."④
    Compulsory Cultivation System
    At the end of the eighteenth century, the East India Company collapsed, as a result of Anglo-Dutch industrial competition, with Dutch industry lagging far behind British industry. The Netherlands was no longer the dominant country in trade and industry, and its monopoly position in trade had been overthrown by Britain.
    After the collapse of the East India Company, the Dutch colonial government was established in 1800. Due to the intensification of exploitation and oppression, the Javanese peasants' uprising of 1825 was triggered. This uprising was led by Diponegoro and was a major uprising in the colonial era. The rebel army adopted guerrilla tactics, making the colonial army exhausted. The war continued for five years before being brutally suppressed.
    After the great uprising was suppressed, the colonial government, in order to solve the economic crisis caused by the war and strengthen exploitation, began to implement a compulsory cultivation system from 1830. The essence of this system was to intensify the compulsory supply system previously implemented by the East India Company. It not only exploited the fruits of the farmers' labor, but also directly requisitioned the farmers' labor force. It stipulated that Javanese farmers must allocate one-fifth of their land to grow crops designated by the government as in-kind land rent paid to the government. It forced farmers to grow coffee, sugarcane, indigo, tobacco, or tea, which were all commodities that could generate the most profit in the European market. The system stipulated that those without land must perform sixty-six days of unpaid labor for the colonial government each year. The colonial government made full use of the feudal system and closely integrated with the feudal lords when implementing this system. It stipulated that feudal lords or officials who supervised farmers' planting could extract a certain percentage of the crop harvest as remuneration. Feudal lords and officials used this stipulation to exploit farmers extensively, forcing them to allocate the best land to grow the economic crops designated by the government, leaving barren land for growing grain; and forced farmers to cultivate the government's portion first, planting their own portion after the season had passed.
    This compulsory cultivation system plunged farmers into a miserable situation: poverty, hunger, disease, famine, and death. In 1844, a major famine occurred in Grobogan, Central Java, and most of the residents starved to death. Farmers in many areas continued to stage uprisings.
    On the other hand, due to the implementation of the compulsory cultivation system, the colonial government remitted an average of three million guilders to the Dutch treasury every year. During the forty years (1830-1870) of implementing the compulsory cultivation system, a total of nine hundred million guilders were remitted to the Netherlands, exceeding the profits extracted by the East India Company in two hundred years. This huge profit made the Netherlands, like an anemic patient receiving a large amount of blood transfusion, suddenly become active, and the railway network and textile industry developed rapidly. It can be seen that the development of Dutch industry grew by sucking the blood of the Indonesian people.
    New Colonial Policy
    By the 1870s, the Dutch industrial bourgeoisie had developed to the point where its power could force the Dutch colonial government to abandon its commercial monopoly, abolish the compulsory cultivation system, and open up industrial markets and investment locations in Indonesia. On the other hand, since the 1870s, world capitalism had developed to the stage of capital export, the competition for colonies intensified, and the development of capitalism led to an unprecedented concentration of capital in a few countries, so much so that they could not find places to use capital at home, so they knocked on the door of Indonesia. Due to its own weakness, the Dutch colonialists were forced to open the door of Indonesia and allow international capitalist forces to enter.
    Due to the above two reasons, the Dutch colonial government implemented a new colonial policy in 1870. The main content of this policy was, first, to abolish the compulsory cultivation system (but the compulsory cultivation of coffee was not abolished until 1915), and second, to promulgate the Land Law, implement state ownership of land, and confiscate countless mountains, forests, uncultivated land, and grasslands. The colonial government provided capitalists with convenient conditions for plundering land, and business owners could lease land from the government for a long period (seventy-five years) to establish plantations. Although Indonesian farmers were not allowed to transfer land to non-Indonesians, short-term leases were allowed, which was a disguised form of transfer. This Land Law accelerated the differentiation process of farmers and promoted some capitalist development in agriculture, but it also preserved the pre-capitalist exploitation methods used by local landlords and foreign capitalists to exploit landless or land-poor farmers. A large number of bankrupt farmers in Java provided cheap labor for the plantations.
    After the colonial government opened Indonesia's door to international capitalist forces, in addition to the Netherlands, the largest investor was Britain, followed by the United States, France, Germany, and Belgium. The Dutch and British jointly organized the Royal Dutch Shell Oil Company, an oil trust, and jointly operated tin mines. The claws of American capital also extended into the oil and rubber sectors.
    By the beginning of the 20th century, Java was filled with various plantations, and eastern Sumatra became Indonesia's largest plantation area. International financial capital groups set up banks in Indonesia, and agricultural product processing and manufacturing plants were gradually established. In order to facilitate the plunder of agricultural products, the dumping of industrial products, and the suppression of people's uprisings, railways were built, various repair workshops were established, and shipping companies gradually developed. The class differentiation process accelerated, farmers lost land at an accelerated pace, and the proletariat was formed. With the intensification of national oppression and exploitation, the national liberation movement flourished. In 1926-1927, under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party, the Indonesian people launched a great uprising, giving the Dutch colonialists a great blow.
    Round Table Conference Agreement
    Due to the hard struggle of the Indonesian people, and the tremendous changes in the balance of power between the socialist and capitalist camps after World War II, conditions favorable to the national independence movement were created. In 1945, the Republic of Indonesia was born. It politically broke free from the shackles of Dutch colonial rule, but economically, due to the signing of the Round Table Conference Agreement, Indonesia's plantations, oil, tin mines, banks, shipping, and other important enterprises were still largely in the hands of Dutch colonialists. At the same time, West Irian, which accounted for 20% of Indonesian territory, was still occupied by Dutch colonialists. Currently, the Indonesian people are launching a vigorous struggle to completely abolish the Round Table Conference Agreement and liberate West Irian. The Indonesian government has taken over many enterprises of the Dutch colonialists. This just struggle of the Indonesian people has received enthusiastic support from people all over the world. We believe that the Indonesian people's anti-colonialist struggle will surely be victorious!

    荷兰殖民者怎样侵略印度尼西亚
    吴世璜
    荷兰殖民者三百六十年来对印度尼西亚的侵略，“展示了一幅背信弃义，贿赂，虐杀，和卑劣的画图”①；另一方面，印度尼西亚人民反抗荷兰侵略的英勇斗争，则写下了无数可歌可泣的诗篇。
    香料垄断
    荷兰是“十七世纪资本主义的标本国家”②，在资本原始积累时期，它就以掠夺印度尼西亚的香料（主要是胡椒、丁香和肉豆蔻）为其获取利润的主要手段之一。1596年荷兰商船首次到达爪哇海港，和老牌殖民国家葡萄牙争夺香料。为了加强和葡萄牙竞争的力量，几个荷兰贸易公司于1602年合并组成东印度公司。它得到了荷兰国会给予在印度尼西亚通商的独占权，同时又获得了在印度尼西亚征募军队、建筑炮台、发行货币、任命官吏和代表荷兰国会和外国缔结条约等特权。东印度公司就俨然具有“国家”的权力了。
    东印度公司成立之后，在出产香料的中心地摩鹿加群岛使用暴力和利用岛屿上封建主之间的矛盾，攫得了几个根据地，和葡萄牙展开了激烈的斗争。斗争的结果，葡萄牙的势力被排斥出去，由荷兰掌握了贩卖香料的垄断权。东印度公司把收购香料的价格定得非常之低，强迫摩鹿加居民必须按照规定的价格把香料卖给它，违者“格杀勿论”。1621年班达岛居民因为反抗这蛮横无理的规定，惨遭屠杀，全岛居民几乎全被杀光。印度尼西亚香料在欧洲市场上的供应有时供过于求，价格降落，东印度公司立即派遣大队快艇，驰往各岛砍伐民间种植的香料树，使产量减少，提高价格。东印度公司这种残酷的剥削和压迫，引起了摩鹿加居民不断的起义，其中最著名的是1817年巴迪慕拉领导的起义，起义者曾给荷兰殖民者以沉重的打击。
    东印度公司在摩鹿加建立据点后不久（1619年）即侵占雅加达作为侵略印度尼西亚的大本营，排挤英国在爪哇的势力，利用爪哇岛上两个王国：马打蓝和万丹之间的矛盾，扩张势力，霸占领土。荷兰侵略头子燕·彼得斯逊·昆曾经规定了一个殖民政策，他说：“唯一正确的政策，就是嗾使一个王国去反对另一个王国……不让万丹变得太弱，也不让马打蓝变得太强”。
    东印度公司在爪哇实行强迫供应制来剥削印度尼西亚人民，它强制规定了在它势力范围内的居民必须缴纳的农作物的种类和数量，使印度尼西亚的农作物为输出而服务，向着片面的畸形的方向发展。
    东印度公司除了夺取印度尼西亚农民的劳动果实，每年还从印度运来大量的鸦片，毒害印度尼西亚人民。此外它又四出掳掠印度尼西亚人民为奴隶，每年从巴厘运来大批奴隶到雅加达做苦工。马克思在“资本论”中指出：“荷兰人为要获得在爪哇使用的奴隶，曾在西里伯岛（今苏拉威西——作者）实行一种盗人制度，它并为此目的，训练了一批盗人的人。”③接着马克思又指出：由于荷兰殖民者的残酷剥削，“他们足迹所至，随即发生荒废与人口消灭的现象。爪哇本鸠汪吉地方，1750年，居民有八万以上，1811年，不过留下八千人。”④
    强迫种植制度
    十八世纪末东印度公司倒闭了，这是由于英、荷工业竞争，荷兰的工业被英国工业远远地抛在后面的结果。荷兰已经不是贸易和工业的统治国家了，荷兰在贸易上的垄断地位已被英国推翻了。
    东印度公司倒闭之后，1800年成立荷兰殖民地政府。由于剥削和压迫的加强，引起了1825年爪哇农民大起义，这次起义是由帝博尼哥罗领导的，这是殖民时代的一次大起义，起义军采用游击战术，使殖民军队疲于奔命，战争继续了五年之久，最后被残酷地镇压下去。
    大起义被镇压之后，殖民地政府为了解决由战争而引起的经济危机和加强剥削，由1830年开始实行强迫种植制度。这制度的本质，是变本加厉地实行东印度公司过去推行的强迫供应制，它不仅剥削农民的劳动果实，而且直接征用农民的劳动力。它规定了爪哇农民必须拨出五分之一的土地种植政府指定的农作物，作为向政府缴纳的实物地租。它强制农民必须种植咖啡、甘蔗、木蓝、烟草或茶等，这些经济作物都是在欧洲市场上最能获取利润的商品。制度规定没有土地的人每年须为殖民地政府做六十六天无偿的劳动。殖民地政府在实行这制度时，充分利用封建制度，和封建主密切结合在一起。它规定监督农民种植的封建主或官吏可以从农作物的收成中抽取若干成作为酬劳。封建主及官吏利用这种规定，向农民大肆剥削，强迫农民将最好的土地拨出来种植政府指定的经济作物，剩下瘠硗的土地种粮食；又强迫农民先耕种政府的部分，过了季节时令，才种自己的部分。
    这种强迫种植制度，使农民陷入悲惨的境地：贫困、饥饿、疾病、灾荒和死亡。1844年中爪哇格罗博甘发生大灾荒，居民大都饿死了。许多地区的农民不断地举行起义。
    另一方面，殖民地政府由于实行强迫种植制度，平均每年汇回荷兰国库三百万盾。在实行强迫种植制度的四十年间（1830—1870），总共汇回荷兰九万万盾，超过了东印度公司二百年间榨取的利润。这巨大的利润，使荷兰像一个贫血病者得到了大量的输血，霍然活跃起来，铁道网和纺织业迅速发展起来。由此可知，荷兰工业的发展是靠吸吮印度尼西亚人民的鲜血成长起来的。
    新殖民政策
    荷兰工业资产阶级发展到十九世纪七十年代，它的力量已经能够迫使荷兰殖民地政府放弃商业垄断权，取消强迫种植制，在印度尼西亚开辟工业市场和投资的场所。另一方面，自十九世纪七十年代开始，世界资本主义已经发展到资本输出的阶段，殖民地的争夺加强起来，资本主义的发展使少数国家内的资本达到空前未有的集中，以致在国内找不到运用资本的场所，于是它们来敲印度尼西亚的大门了。荷兰殖民者由于本身的软弱，被迫将印度尼西亚的大门打开，让国际资本主义势力进来。
    由于上述两种原因，荷兰殖民地政府于1870年实行新殖民政策。这政策的主要内容，首先是取消强迫种植制（但强迫种植咖啡直到1915年才取消），其次是公布土地法，实行土地国有，没收了无数的山林、未耕地和草原。殖民地政府为资本家提供了掠夺土地的便利条件，企业主可以向政府长期（七十五年）租赁土地建立种植园。印度尼西亚农民的土地虽然不许转让给非印度尼西亚人，但允许作短期的租赁，这是变相的转让。这个土地法加速了农民的分化过程，并在农业方面促进了某些资本主义的发展，但又保存了本国地主和外国资本家去剥削无地或少地的农民的前资本主义的剥削方式。爪哇大批破产的农民为种植园提供了廉价的劳动力。
    殖民地政府把印度尼西亚的大门敞开让国际资本主义势力进来之后，除荷兰外，投资最多的是英国，次为美、法、德、比等。荷、英共同组织了石油托辣斯皇家石油壳牌石油公司，又共同经营锡矿。美国资本的魔手也伸进了石油和橡胶两部门。
    到了二十世纪初，爪哇布满了各种种植园，苏门答腊东部成为印度尼西亚最广大的种植园地区。国际金融资本集团纷纷在印度尼西亚设立银行，同时农产品加工制造厂逐渐建立起来。为了便于掠夺农产品、倾销工业品和镇压人民起义，于是铁路修建起来了，各种修理工场也设立起来，航运公司逐渐发展。阶级分化过程加速进行，农民加速地丧失土地，无产阶级形成了。随着民族压迫和剥削的加剧，民族解放运动蓬勃地发展起来。到了1926—1927年印度尼西亚人民在印度尼西亚共产党领导之下，举行了大起义，给予荷兰殖民者极大的打击。
    圆桌会议协定
    由于印度尼西亚人民的艰苦奋斗，和第二次世界大战后社会主义阵营和资本主义阵营力量的对比发生了巨大变化，创造了有利于民族独立运动的条件，1945年印度尼西亚共和国诞生了。它在政治上摆脱了荷兰殖民统治的枷锁，但是在经济上，由于圆桌会议协定的签订，印度尼西亚的种植园、石油、锡矿、银行、航运等重要企业，都仍然大部分掌握在荷兰殖民者手里，同时占印度尼西亚国土20％的西伊里安，仍旧被荷兰殖民者霸占着。目前印度尼西亚人民正为彻底废除圆桌会议协定，为解放西伊里安，展开了如火如荼的斗争。印度尼西亚政府已经接管了荷兰殖民者的许多企业。印度尼西亚人民这种正义的斗争，受到了全世界人民的热烈支持，我们相信，印度尼西亚人民反殖民主义的斗争一定可以得到胜利！
