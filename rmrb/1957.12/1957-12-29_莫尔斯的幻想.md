    Morse's Delusions
    By Our Commentator
    U.S. Senator Wayne Morse recently made a broadcast in Tokyo saying that he has always opposed recognizing New China. At the same time, Morse also advocated handing Taiwan over to the United Nations for "trusteeship." He said that only after this is done would the United States consider the issue of recognizing New China.
    It seems that Morse has too little self-awareness. The liberation of the Chinese people and the establishment and development of the People's Republic of China do not require the approval of the U.S. Congress, let alone the consent of people like Morse. Morse is unwilling to recognize New China, of course he has his freedom, he can insist on his "non-recognition" stance until the day he enters his coffin, and he can write this in his will, which will not have any impact on the Chinese people.
    Judging from Morse's speech, he is actually trying to bargain with the Chinese people. Morse's calculation is this: if the Chinese people are willing to give up sovereignty over Taiwan and hand Taiwan over to the United States through the "trusteeship" of the United Nations, then the American masters might show mercy and recognize China. This is really asking for the sky, a pipe dream! There has never been such a deal in the world: using something that others do not need at all to exchange for others' sacred territory. Morse should wake up! The Chinese people have never been eager for American recognition, and we have always despised imperialists. Even if the United States never recognizes China, the Chinese people can still live as usual, and can live better year by year; and Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the Chinese people are determined to liberate Taiwan, and the United States cannot shake the Chinese people's determination by any means.
    The Chinese people have no illusions about U.S. imperialism. The problem now is that people like Morse have illusions about the Chinese people. They are creating all kinds of "two Chinas" conspiracies,妄想想要求中国人民接受，以便为美国的山穷水尽的对华政策找出路(attempting to force the Chinese people to accept them in order to find a way out for the United States' dead-end China policy). However, facts have long proven that this is just walking from one dead end into another.

    莫尔斯的幻想
    本报评论员
    美国参议员韦恩·莫尔斯最近在东京发表广播说：他一向反对承认新中国。同时，莫尔斯又主张把台湾交给联合国“托管”。他说，只有这样做了以后，美国才会考虑承认新中国的问题。
    看来，莫尔斯是太无自知之明了。中国人民的解放，中华人民共和国的成立和发展，并不需要美国国会批准，更不需要莫尔斯之流同意的。莫尔斯不愿意承认新中国，当然有他的自由，他尽可以坚持“不承认”主张一直到进棺材的一天，并且尽可以把这一点写在他的遗嘱上，那对中国人民是不会有任何影响的。
    从莫尔斯的讲话来看，他实际上是想同中国人民讨价还价的。莫尔斯的算盘是这样打的：如果中国人民愿意放弃台湾的主权，通过联合国“托管”的方式，把台湾让给美国，那么美国老爷们就可能大发慈悲承认中国。这真是漫天要价，异想天开！世界上从来没有这样的买卖：居然用一种别人根本不需要的东西，来换取别人的神圣领土。莫尔斯还是清醒清醒吧！中国人民从来就不稀罕美国的承认，我们对于帝国主义者从来就是鄙视的。美国即使永远不承认中国，中国人民也还是可以照样生活，并且可以生活得一年比一年好；而台湾是中国的领土，中国人民是一定要解放台湾的，美国用任何办法都不能动摇中国人民的决心。
    中国人民对美帝国主义是没有任何幻想的。现在的问题是莫尔斯之流却对中国人民存在着幻想。他们正在制造各种各样的“两个中国”的阴谋，妄想要求中国人民接受，以便为美国的山穷水尽的对华政策找出路。但是，事实早就证明，这不过是从一条死胡同走进另一条死胡同而已。
