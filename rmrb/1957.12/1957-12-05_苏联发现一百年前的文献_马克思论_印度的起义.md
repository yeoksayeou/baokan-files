　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 4th - The Institute of Marxism-Leninism under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union recently discovered an article written by Marx - "The Indian Uprising." The fifth issue of the "Soviet Oriental Studies" magazine, published here, has published this article in Russian for the first time.
    The article discusses the Indian national liberation movement of 1857-1859. It was once published anonymously in the American "New York Daily Tribune" on August 29, 1857. The "Soviet Oriental Studies" magazine pointed out that Marx's notes in his notebook that year undoubtedly confirmed that he wrote the article.
    This article on Indian history summarized the experiences of the Indian people's liberation struggle, analyzed the domestic and international situation in India at that time, and the causes, nature, and driving forces of the uprising. In this article, Marx once again emphasized the universality of Indian dissatisfaction with British rule, and refuted the claim that Indians were indifferent to the events that occurred at that time.
  The article also discusses some issues related to the course of the Indian events.

　　苏联发现一百年前的文献
　　马克思论“印度的起义”
    新华社莫斯科4日电　苏共中央马克思—列宁主义研究院最近发现了马克思写的一篇文章——“印度的起义”。这里出版的“苏维埃东方学”杂志第五期第一次用俄文发表了这篇文章。
    文章是论述1857—1859年印度民族解放运动的。它曾经没有署名刊登在1857年8月29日美国的“纽约每日论坛报”上。“苏维埃东方学”杂志指出，马克思这一年在他的笔记本中的记述毫无疑问地证实了这篇文章是他写的。
    这篇关于印度历史的文章总结了印度人民解放斗争的经验，分析了当时印度国内外的局势、起义的原因、性质和动力。马克思在这篇文章中再次强调指出了印度不满英国统治的普遍性，驳斥了关于印度人对当时所发生的事件是漠不关心的说法。
  文章还论及有关印度事件过程的一些问题。
