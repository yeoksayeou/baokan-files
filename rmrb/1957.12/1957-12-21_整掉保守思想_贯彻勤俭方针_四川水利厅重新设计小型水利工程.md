Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu – After the rectification campaign entered the rectification and improvement phase, cadres of the Sichuan Provincial Water Conservancy Department posted a big-character poster. This big-character poster pointed out that since the province had focused on developing small-scale reservoirs and mountain ponds and other water conservancy projects, due to the conservative thinking of some technical cadres, they deviated from reality in project design, only seeking perfection and grandeur, emphasizing form and one-sidedly stressing safety, thus neglecting the policy of “running water conservancy projects diligently and thriftily.” They designed earth dam projects with excessively gentle slopes and excessively thick dam bodies, resulting in great waste of manpower and materials. The big-character poster also included an accounting: of the approximately 1,200 small-scale reservoirs completed in the province before September this year, if each reservoir had an average dam height of twelve meters and a dam length of sixty meters, approximately 8.6 million cubic meters of earthwork were wasted. This part of the earthwork could be used to build more than 770 similar reservoirs, which could irrigate an additional 890,000 mu of farmland.

After this big-character poster was posted, the rectification leadership group of the Water Conservancy Department immediately convened relevant cadres to launch a debate on the design of small-scale water conservancy projects. As a result of the debate, everyone recognized the past mistakes of design and construction being divorced from the masses.

At present, the Sichuan Provincial Water Conservancy Department has organized technical cadres to redesign the earth dam projects of small-scale reservoirs and mountain ponds.

### 整掉保守思想  贯彻勤俭方针  四川水利厅重新设计小型水利工程

    整掉保守思想  贯彻勤俭方针
    四川水利厅重新设计小型水利工程
    据新华社成都讯  四川省水利厅在整风进入整改阶段后，干部贴出了一张大字报。这张大字报指出：全省从重点开展兴修小型水库和山弯塘等水利工程以来，由于部分技术干部存在着保守思想，在工程设计中脱离实际，只顾求全求大，偏重形式和片面强调安全，因而忽视了“勤俭办水利”的方针。他们将土坝工程设计得坡度过坦，坝身过厚，在人力物力上造成很大浪费。大字报上还算了一笔账：全省今年9月以前已完工的小型水库约一千二百座，如以平均每座水库坝高十二公尺，坝长六十公尺计算，共浪费土方约八百六十万公方。用这部分土方可修同样的水库七百七十多座，可以增灌农田八十九万亩。
    这张大字报贴出后，水利厅的整风领导小组立即召集有关干部对小型水利工程设计问题展开了辩论。辩论结果，大家认识了过去脱离群众的设计施工的错误。
    目前，四川省水利厅已组织技术干部对小型水库、山弯塘的土坝工程重新进行了设计。
