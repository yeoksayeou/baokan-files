Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 27th. Sudanese representative, Foreign Minister Muhammad Ahmad Mahjoub, delivered a report on racial discrimination at the first plenary session of the Asian-African Solidarity Conference on the evening of the 26th. He requested the conference to adopt a resolution condemning racial policies and suggested certain measures be taken in countries with racial discrimination.

The measures he proposed are: immediate abolition of all laws related to racial discrimination or any other discrimination, ensuring freedom of speech and assembly for all people, granting all citizens the right to vote without discrimination, achieving equality between men and women, abolishing laws that stipulate Europeans have the right to plunder land belonging to Africans, and granting all people equal opportunities in the economic field.

He pointed out that racial discrimination is a clear violation of the United Nations Charter. He requested the United Nations to ensure that all member states respect its charter.

Tracing the origin of racial discrimination, the Sudanese representative pointed out that it was sown in Africa by European imperialism. He believes that economic greed is the root of racial discrimination, as evidenced by the fact that Europeans do not give Africans any opportunity to improve their living standards.

The Sudanese representative said that apartheid not only makes the cost of living high for Africans, but also causes poor health, disease, and limited education.

He pointed out that apartheid exists not only in South Africa, but also in the Belgian Congo, Kenya, and even the United States, where it has developed to a terrible extent in the southern United States.

The Sudanese representative expressed his hope that the conference would pay attention to this issue so that Africans can regain their deprived rights.

    苏丹代表主张
    必须根除种族歧视
    新华社开罗27日电　苏丹代表、外交部长穆罕默德·艾哈迈德·马哈古卜26日晚上在亚非团结大会第一次全体会议上作了关于种族歧视的报告。他要求大会通过决议谴责种族政策，并且建议在有种族歧视的国家内采取某些措施。
    他所提议的措施是：立即废除一切有关种族歧视或任何其他歧视的法律，确保全体人民言论和集会的自由，毫无歧视地给予所有的公民以选举权，实现男女平等，废除规定欧洲人有权掠夺属于非洲人的土地的法律，给予全体人民在经济领域中平等的机会。
    他指出，种族歧视显然是违反联合国宪章的。他要求联合国使所有成员国都尊重它的宪章。
    苏丹代表在追溯种族歧视的起源时指出，这是欧洲帝国主义在非洲种下的。他认为，经济上的贪婪是种族歧视的根源，其证据是欧洲人不给非洲人以任何改善生活水平的机会。
    苏丹代表说，种族隔离不但使得非洲人生活费用高昂，而且也造成了健康情况恶劣、疾病和教育受到限制的情况。
    他指出，种族隔离不仅存在于南非，而且存在于比属刚果、怯尼亚以至美国，在美国南部发展到了可怕的程度。
    苏丹代表表示希望会议将注意这个问题，而使得非洲人能重新获得他们被剥夺了的权利。
