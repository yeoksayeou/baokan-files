Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, December 10th: Indonesian Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Djuanda, in his capacity as the highest military authority, announced on the 9th that all Dutch plantations in Indonesia, as well as plantation-affiliated factories and agricultural experiment stations, would be placed under the control of the Indonesian government.

Army Chief of Staff Nasution and Finance Minister Slamet issued a joint statement on the 9th, announcing military control over the Jakarta headquarters and other branches of the three Dutch banks: Escomptobank, Andelsbank, and Escompto Discount Bank.

In addition, in East Java, West Java, North Sumatra, and Makassar in Sulawesi, Indonesian workers and youth took over some Dutch banks and enterprises, or supervised these banks and enterprises.

So far, in the struggle of the Indonesian people to liberate West Irian, Dutch enterprises that have been placed under Indonesian government control or taken over by workers and handed over to the government include: all Dutch plantations, three major banks, four shipping companies including the Royal Dutch Steamship Company, and four of the five major Dutch trading companies, including Jacobson van den Berg, Internationale Crediet- en Handels-Vereeniging "Rotterdam" (International), and Mirandolle, Voute & Co. Some hotels, clubs, libraries, and factories in Jakarta, Palembang, and other places were also taken over by workers. In addition, in the most resource-rich areas such as North Sumatra, the military authorities also ordered the control of all local Dutch enterprises.

Currently, Dutch enterprises that have been controlled or announced to be controlled account for the majority of Dutch monopoly enterprises in Indonesia. Because the main oil enterprise, Bataafsche Petroleum Maatschappij (BPM), is a Dutch, British, and American joint venture, it has not yet been touched.

Currently, all controlled enterprises are still operating as usual, and Indonesian workers are closely protecting the materials and equipment in the enterprises.

The Indonesian government has not yet decided whether to nationalize or confiscate these Dutch enterprises that have been placed under control. The government stated that it may study how to deal with these enterprises after the West Irian issue is resolved. The Indonesian government may decide whether to pay the Dutch enterprises appropriate compensation based on the Netherlands' attitude on the West Irian issue.

    印度尼西亚总理宣布
    管制全部荷兰种植园
    军政当局对荷兰银行实行军事管制
    据新华社雅加达10日电　印度尼西亚总理兼国防部长朱安达在9日以最高军权执掌者的身分宣布，印度尼西亚国内的所有荷兰种植园以及种植园附属的工厂和农业试验站等一律由印度尼西亚政府实行管制。
    陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安和财政部长斯拉梅特在9日发表联合声明，宣布对小公银行、安达银行和亦士公银行这三家荷兰银行的雅加达总行和在其他地方的分行实行军事管制。
    此外，在东爪哇、西爪哇、北苏门答腊和苏拉威西的望加锡，印度尼西亚的工人和青年接管了一些荷兰银行和企业，或者对这些银行和企业实行监督。
    到目前为止，在印度尼西亚人民为争取解放西伊里安而进行的斗争中，被印度尼西亚政府加以管制以及被工人接管后移交政府的荷兰企业有：全部荷兰的种植园、三家大银行、包括荷兰皇家轮船公司在内的四家轮船公司、荷兰五大洋行中的玉美利、国际、雅谷逊和慕娘等四大洋行。雅加达、巨港等地的一些旅馆、俱乐部、图书馆和工厂也被工人接管。此外，在北苏门答腊等物产最丰富的地区，军事当局也下令对当地所有荷兰企业实行管制。
    目前已经被管制和已经宣布管制的荷兰企业占在印度尼西亚的荷兰垄断企业的大部分。因为主要的石油企业巴达维亚石油公司是一个荷兰、英国和美国的合资企业，所以还没有去触动它。
    目前，所有被管制的企业仍然在照常进行工作，印度尼西亚的工人正在严密地保护着企业中的物资和设备。
    印度尼西亚政府还没有决定把这些已经加以管制的荷兰企业收归国有还是予以没收。政府表示，可能在西伊里安问题解决以后才去研究怎样处理这些企业的问题。印度尼西亚政府可能根据荷兰在西伊里安问题上的态度来决定是否付给荷兰企业一笔适当的补偿费。
