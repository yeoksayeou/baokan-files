Dear fellow delegates, dear friends:

Less than seven weeks after the close of the Fourth World Trade Union Congress, the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions is being held.

Since the Fourth World Trade Union Congress has shown the growing strength and influence of the World Federation of Trade Unions, I ask you to accept the warm congratulations of our international trade union organization, wishing your congress success, and at the same time express our sincere gratitude to the Chinese trade unions and workers for their great contribution to strengthening the strength of the world trade union movement.

Taking the opportunity of attending your congress, the delegation of the World Federation of Trade Unions wants to pay tribute to one of the members of the World Federation of Trade Unions. The trade union organizations of various countries belonging to the World Federation of Trade Unions are strengthening international workers' solidarity and enriching and clarifying the content of solidarity in the current international situation.

You have contributed to strengthening the international workers' movement through the various achievements you have made in the great and historically significant economic and social reforms in your country.

Your various achievements have aroused the admiration of your brothers, sisters, and working men and women all over the world. Even our class enemies cannot but express respect or feel uneasy about this achievement.

Your wise and open evaluation of your own achievements and difficulties helps our workers' organizations to strive for the most responsible attitude to move forward.

Since we first met on your Chinese soil, your victorious people's revolution has achieved increasingly brilliant achievements. That meeting was in November 1949, a few weeks after the founding of the People's Republic of China, when the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference was held.

All this is well known. But it is not useless to trace it. Under the tireless leadership of your glorious Communist Party of China, you are advancing towards the road of socialist society. You have opened up this road in a unique way according to the actual conditions of your country. You are advancing along this creative path, while showing your absolute loyalty to the great lessons of the 1917 October Revolution for the international workers' movement, which we have just celebrated its fortieth anniversary.

On the new historical page of your country, we are very pleased to see that it includes the great efforts made by the Chinese trade unions.

Your trade unions are active participants in the main activities of your national life. Trade unions represent a large part of the vivid democracy in your people's democratic country. All this explains the origin of the prestige enjoyed by the Chinese trade unions in the ranks of the entire world trade union movement. Organizationally, the World Federation of Trade Unions has 92 million members. And the entire world trade union movement exceeds the number represented by the World Federation of Trade Unions.

We are pleased to note that Comrade Lai Ruoyu, in his report to the Congress, reiterated the determination of the Chinese trade union organizations to strengthen their international activities and further expand their international contacts. Comrade Lai Ruoyu, in quoting the recent resolutions and decisions of the Fourth World Trade Union Congress, reminded us that the greatest task for all trade union organizations is to achieve unity on an international scale.

I should say that after the Leipzig Congress, our common obligations and responsibilities require us to continue to move forward on the road to unity. For us, seeking unity is not only the obligation to abide by the decisions of a congress, it is not a moral and emotional matter. Seeking unity is due to the need to develop the activities of our workers' organizations and the need to guarantee the victory of workers all over the world.

Achieving unity means that workers have more means to take action in the current situation in the struggle against imperialism, for peace, social and economic progress, and for national independence.

For working men and women, unity is the result of hard work. Just as all the new rights they have won are the result of their struggle against international reactionaries, against exploiters, and against imperialist forces.

When workers in various countries unite and act together to achieve clear goals, they strengthen their strength and enable the situation to develop in a favorable direction.

Take the Algerian issue as an example. The World Federation of Trade Unions again issued an appeal to the United Nations General Assembly, which is discussing the Algerian issue, last week. We reiterated to the various member states of the United Nations that workers from various countries and participating in different international trade union organizations support the Algerian people's right to independence and demand a peaceful solution to the Algerian issue.

Attention should be paid to this common position of all trade union organizations. This common position must also be explained at the United Nations General Assembly. However, it is necessary to work together to organize concerted action to make the pressure of workers and trade unions around the world more effective.

This is not an abstract requirement based on our theory. This is a practical need related to the current struggle situation of the Algerian people and workers. For the Algerian people and workers, it is not enough to only express international workers' support to them, or to partially realize it, but to effectively guarantee its full realization.

The resolution of the Fourth World Trade Union Congress stipulates the promotion of the establishment of an international committee to support Algerian workers, which embodies this requirement.

Considering the struggle of the working people for peace, it is necessary to reorganize concerted action. National trade union organizations belonging to various international organizational systems can participate in this action, because they have expressed common opinions and propositions, especially in the prohibition and abolition of atomic and thermonuclear weapons.

Trade union organizations in various countries should always pay attention to how to unite with the peace forces of other social strata in the actions to strive for peace.

This makes it absolutely necessary for these trade union organizations to achieve organized and coordinated efforts on an international scale. Therefore, the world-scale movement to ban atomic and thermonuclear weapons initiated by the World Peace Council will receive indispensable and irreplaceable support to strive for the peace and security desired by the people of all countries.

It should not be assumed that the combination of the organized forces of the working class in the world will automatically and suddenly be realized. It is understandable that initiatives must be taken constantly and boldly. We will gladly welcome any initiative that can strengthen the struggle of workers for peace and make this struggle effective.

Therefore, in order to strive for unity, the World Federation of Trade Unions and its member organizations will not ignore any steps, any initiatives, and any suggestions for striving for concerted action, as long as they can lead workers to realize the international unity of their trade unions.

At the same time, we solemnly declare that seeking worker unity must start from class principles and from strengthening the organizational capacity of working men and women, because they are a social class that is clearly different from their exploiting class.

This is the main principle in the conclusions of the Fourth World Trade Union Congress, and these principles are the conclusions drawn from the countless experiences in the long history of the international workers' movement over a century.

We believe that congresses like the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions will give the workers of China new prospects, and also give the workers of the world new prospects based on our international workers' solidarity principles.

This explains why so many foreign trade union delegations have come to attend your congress.

Therefore, I would like to once again represent the World Federation of Trade Unions in wishing your congress a great success.

Long live international workers' solidarity!

Long live the solidarity of workers all over the world!

Long live the All-China Federation of Trade Unions!

Long live the World Federation of Trade Unions, a firm fighter for the great cause of international trade union unity and for peace and friendship between the people of all countries!

### 世界工会联合会总书记  路易·赛扬的祝词

    世界工会联合会总书记
    路易·赛扬的祝词
    亲爱的代表同志们，亲爱的朋友们：
    在世界工会第四次代表大会闭幕后不到七个星期，就举行中国工会第八次全国代表大会。
    既然世界工会第四次代表大会已经显示出世界工联的力量和影响日益增长，所以我请你们接受我们这个国际工会组织的热烈祝贺，祝你们大会成功，同时对中国工会和劳动者对加强世界工会运动力量所作出的巨大贡献，恳切地表示感谢。
    世界工联代表团趁出席你们的代表大会的机会，要向参加世界工联的会员之一致敬。世界工联所属各国工会组织在当前国际形势中使国际工人团结日益加强、团结的内容更加丰富、更加明确。
    你们在你们国家里进行伟大的、有历史意义的经济和社会改革中获得种种成就，从而对加强国际工人运动作出了贡献。
    你们的各种成就引起了你们的兄弟、姊妹和全世界男女劳动者的钦佩。就是我们的阶级敌人也不得不对这种成就表示尊敬或者感到惶惶不安。
    你们明智地对自己的成就和困难公开加以评价，这就有助于我们的工人组织力求采取最负责的态度向前进展。
    自从我们第一次在你们中国的国土上见面以来，你们的胜利的人民革命已经获得日益辉煌的成就。那次见面是在1949年11月，中华人民共和国成立后几星期，举行亚洲澳洲工会会议的时候。
    这一切都是人所共知的。但是加以追述，不是无益的。你们在光荣的中国共产党领导之下不停息地在向着社会主义社会的道路上前进。你们根据自己国家的实际，以独特的方法开拓了这条道路。你们在沿着这条创造性的道路前进，同时表明你们绝对忠实于我们刚刚庆祝了四十周年的1917年十月革命对于国际工人运动的伟大教训。
    在你们国家的新的史页上，我们感到十分愉快地看到其中包括着中国工会所作出的巨大努力。
    你们的工会是你们国家生活的主要活动的积极参加者。工会代表着你们人民民主国家生活中一大部分生动的民主。这一切说明了中国工会在整个世界工会运动的行列中所享有的威望的由来。从组织方面来说，世界工联拥有九千二百万会员。而整个世界工会运动是超过世界工联所代表的这一数字的。
    我们高兴地注意到：赖若愚同志在他向代表大会作的报告里重申中国工会组织决心加强它们的国际活动，进一步扩大它们的国际联系。赖若愚同志在引用世界工会第四次代表大会最近的决议和决定时，提醒我们说：对于一切工会组织的莫大的任务就是在国际范围内实现团结一致。
    我应该说，在来比锡代表大会以后，我们的共同义务和责任要求我们在团结的道路上继续迈进。对于我们来说，寻求团结不仅仅是遵守一次代表大会的决定的义务，这并不是道义上和感情上的事情。寻求团结一致是由于必须发展我们工人组织的活动和需要保证全世界劳动者的胜利。
    实现团结一致，意味着劳动者在当前形势下进行反对帝国主义、争取和平、社会与经济进步和争取民族独立的斗争拥有更多的采取行动的手段。
    对于男女劳动者说来，团结一致是努力争取的结果。就像争取到的一切新的权利是他们对国际反动势力、对剥削者、对帝国主义力量斗争取得胜利的结果一样。
    当他们团结起来一致行动以便达到明确的目标时，各国的劳动者就加强了力量，使得事态能向有利的方向发展。
    拿阿尔及利亚问题作例子。世界工联在上周再次向正在讨论阿尔及利亚问题的联合国大会发出呼吁。我们再次向联合国各个会员国说明各个国家和参加不同国际工会组织的劳动者都支持阿尔及利亚人民享有独立的权利，并要求和平解决阿尔及利亚问题。
    应该注意到一切工会组织的这个共同立场。必须也在联合国大会上说明这种共同立场。然而，必须协力组织一致行动，以使世界各国劳动者和工会的压力更为有效。
    这并不是从我们的理论出发的抽象要求。这是同阿尔及利亚人民和劳动者当前斗争形势有关连的实际需要。对于阿尔及利亚人民和劳动者来说，不应该仅仅对他们表示国际工人的支持，部分地实现也不够，而是应该有效地保证完全实现。
    世界工会第四次代表大会的决议中规定促进建立一个支援阿尔及利亚劳动者国际委员会，就是体现了这种要求。
    考虑到劳动人民争取和平的斗争，重新有必要组织一致行动。属于各个不同国际组织系统的各国全国性工会组织都可以参加这一行动，因为它们都表示出共同的意见和主张，特别是在禁止和废除原子和热核子武器方面。
    各国工会组织应该经常注意如何在争取和平的行动中同其它社会阶层的和平力量联合起来。
    这就使得这些工会组织完全有必要在国际范围实现有组织地协同努力。因此，世界和平理事会所发起的禁止原子和热核子武器的世界规模的运动，将得到不可或缺的、不能替代的支持来争取实现各国人民所渴望的和平与安全。
    不应该认为世界上工人阶级有组织的力量的结合将自动地突然实现。可以理解：必须不断地、大胆地采取主动。我们将愉快地欢迎一切足以使劳动者拥护和平的斗争加强、使这个斗争取得实效的任何倡议。
    因此，为了力求团结，世界工联和它的会员组织将不忽视争取一致行动的任何步骤、任何倡议和任何建议，只要能使劳动者走向实现他们工会的国际团结。
    我们同时郑重申明：谋求工人团结一致要从阶级原则出发，从加强男女劳动者组织能力的基础出发，因为他们是同他们的剥削者阶级断然不同的一个社会阶级。
    这就是世界工会第四次代表大会结论中的主要原则，这些原则是从一个世纪以来国际工人运动长期斗争历史的无数经验中得出的结论。
    我们相信像中国工会第八次全国代表大会这样的代表大会将给予中国的劳动者以新的前景，而且，根据我们的国际工人团结原则，也将给世界的劳动者以新的前景。
    这就说明了为什么这么多的外国工会代表团前来参加你们的大会。
    所以我要再次代表世界工联祝你们这次代表大会获得巨大成功。
    国际工人团结万岁！
    世界劳动者团结万岁！
    中华全国总工会万岁！
    争取国际工会团结和争取和平和各国人民之间的友谊的伟大事业的坚决战士——世界工联万岁！
