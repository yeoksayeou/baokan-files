Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, November 30th: More than 20 leading ethnic cadres from the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture and Yining City in Xinjiang recently held a meeting to discuss the instructions of Deng Xiaoping, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, in his report on the rectification movement, which stated that "in all minority areas and among minority populations where the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production has been basically realized, socialist education should be carried out in the same way, and appropriate anti-rightist struggles should be conducted." In their speeches, everyone unanimously supported carrying out anti-rightist struggles and criticizing local nationalism among ethnic cadres.

Jia Heda (Kazakh), the governor of the autonomous prefecture, said: The rectification movement and anti-rightist struggle have been launched throughout the country, and our Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture is no exception. The Central Committee's proposal to focus on criticizing local nationalism in the rectification movement and anti-rightist struggle is completely correct and necessary. Some people believe that rectification and anti-rightist struggles are matters for Han cadres. This view is wrong and must be corrected. There are bureaucratism, subjectivism, and sectarianism among the ethnic cadres in the autonomous prefecture, as well as rightists, and in recent years local nationalism has also been on the rise. Therefore, we must resolutely carry out the rectification movement in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee. Ethnic leading cadres must actively and conscientiously participate in and lead this movement, and work under the unified leadership of the Party. Only in this way can we have unified thinking and action, and avoid making mistakes.

Abudureyim Aisa (Uyghur), the deputy governor of the autonomous prefecture, said that the instructions to carry out rectification and appropriately conduct anti-rightist struggles in minority areas are correct, and we must resolutely implement them. The autonomous prefecture has carried out a series of political movements in recent years, and the socialist consciousness of the people and cadres of all ethnic groups has been greatly improved. Party organizations have been established in various places. Therefore, the conditions for carrying out rectification and appropriately conducting anti-rightist struggles in the autonomous prefecture are fully available. Not everyone is satisfied with our previous political movements. Some people oppose and hate the Communist Party and take advantage of the Communist Party's rectification to oppose the Communist Party and oppose socialism. They wear the cloak of representatives of ethnic interests, exaggerate the shortcomings in our ethnic work, and provoke and incite discord among ethnic groups, undermining ethnic unity and national unification. It is not conducive to the socialist construction of the motherland if we do not criticize and struggle against such bad elements. In recent years, local nationalism has been on the rise again among ethnic intellectuals in the autonomous prefecture. This is harmful to ethnic unity and also harmful to the development of the ethnic group itself. Therefore, we must resolutely oppose local nationalist tendencies in the rectification.

Nugushetian (Kazakh), the director of the Public Security Bureau of the autonomous prefecture, said that in recent years, local nationalist ideas have grown anew. For example, some people clamor for "national independence," the establishment of "East Turkistan," the establishment of an ethnic party, and the exclusion of Han cadres and Han people. Among these people, some use ethnic issues as an excuse to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party; others are deliberately undermining ethnic unity and national unification. Local nationalism is an important aspect of bourgeois nationalist ideology and is very harmful to ethnic unity. If we want to take the socialist road, we must have the unity of all ethnic groups and the unity of the motherland, and more importantly, the leadership of the Communist Party. Opposing the leadership of the Party, creating ethnic divisions, and undermining the unity of the motherland is a disaster for minority ethnic groups. Therefore, carrying out rectification and appropriately conducting anti-rightist struggles in minority ethnic groups is of great significance.

At the symposium, Halatibai (Kazakh), deputy chief procurator of the autonomous prefecture, Xia Yimardan (Kazakh), president of the People's Court of the autonomous prefecture, Basti (Uyghur), deputy secretary of the Yining Municipal Party Committee, Kudeke (Kazakh), secretary of the Party Committee of the autonomous prefecture's cultural, educational, and health system, and Hasanov (Uyghur), mayor of Yining City, and others emphasized in their speeches that combining the opposition to local nationalist tendencies in the rectification movement is of great significance, and expressed their willingness to actively lead and carry out this movement.

Xinhua News Agency, Kashi, November 30th: At a recent meeting of three-level cadres in Kashi City, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, local ethnic cadres spoke enthusiastically, exposing and criticizing the local nationalist ideas that currently exist among some cadres and intellectuals.

The materials provided at the meeting proved that under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people of all ethnic groups in Kashi City have achieved victory in the democratic revolution and the socialist revolution over the past eight years. Through training in multiple political movements, cadres and the masses of all ethnic groups have raised their awareness, and most people actively support the Communist Party and are determined to take the socialist road. However, in the past one or two years, local nationalism has grown to a certain extent among some minority people, and there is a tendency to expand, especially during the period of blooming and contending, some bourgeois elements and landlord elements, under the guise of loving the ethnic group, incited the masses, provoked ethnic relations, slandered the Party's ethnic policies, and launched a frenzied attack on the Communist Party and socialism, attempting to undermine the unity of the motherland and the unity of all ethnic groups. They said that the fact that some Han cadres held leadership positions in the Party Committee meant that the autonomous region was only nominally autonomous, excluded Han cadres and all external cadres, and wanted Han cadres to return to the interior, and incited the masses to say: "There is less rice in Kashi, and the peaches are expensive, all because the Han cadres have eaten them all." Even when a Han engineer led ethnic workers to build a highway bridge, they said that "the Han people are ruling high above, driving the Uyghur people to do heavy work."

The materials exposed at the meeting showed that, in addition to a very small number of bourgeois elements and landlord elements who opposed the Communist Party and socialism attacking the Communist Party under the guise of ethnicity, because some cadres had not yet established a correct communist view of ethnicity, some leading cadres had the view that "as long as you oppose Han chauvinism, everything will be fine," thus allowing bourgeois nationalist statements to find some market.

Uyghur and other ethnic cadres participating in the meeting enthusiastically and earnestly criticized these local nationalist tendencies, and unanimously pointed out that local nationalism is a poison that splits national unity and socialist construction, and is fundamentally incompatible with the proletarian view of ethnicity and Marxism-Leninism. Ethnic cadres also cited many examples to prove that the tremendous changes in Kashi City in recent years and the happy life of the people of all ethnic groups are inseparable from the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the support and assistance of the people of all ethnic groups in the country, especially the support and assistance of the Han people. The vast majority of Han cadres have come to the border areas far from their homes with loyalty and sincerity to serve the people of minority ethnic groups, and have been welcomed by ethnic minority cadres and the masses. The words of local nationalists in this regard completely violate the fundamental interests of the minority ethnic groups.

After exposure and criticism, the local ethnic cadres participating in the meeting generally further recognized the reactionary nature and harmfulness of local nationalism, and unanimously expressed their determination to wage a resolute struggle against local nationalism. Tudiyov, the mayor of Kashi City, said: "Only by thoroughly exposing bourgeois nationalism and further strengthening the unity of all ethnic groups can the cause of socialist construction advance by leaps and bounds."

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, November 25th: The Guangxi Provincial Ethnic Affairs Commission recently held a meeting of directors of ethnic affairs commissions from special districts, cities, and counties to deploy the criticism of Han chauvinism and local nationalism in ethnic areas of Guangxi Province in conjunction with the rectification movement.

The directors of the ethnic affairs commissions who participated in the meeting put forward specific methods for criticizing the two kinds of nationalism: under the unified leadership of the local Party committees of the Communist Party of China, in conjunction with the rectification movement in various counties this winter and spring, begin to speak out freely among cadres and the masses, and combine this with the criticism of nationalism. The methods and methods of criticism should be self-examination and criticism by each ethnic group (focusing on positive education among the masses) to improve ideological understanding and achieve ethnic unity.

Many directors of ethnic affairs commissions spoke at the meeting, explaining the necessity of focusing on criticizing local nationalism. Liang Bin (Miao), the county head of the Miao Autonomous County, said that in the past, the criticism of these two kinds of nationalist ideology in the Damiao Mountains mainly focused on criticizing Han chauvinism while ignoring criticizing local nationalism. Of course, it was correct to emphasize criticizing Han chauvinism in the past, and we must continue to resolutely criticize Han chauvinism in the future. However, in the past, there was insufficient criticism of local nationalist ideology. Therefore, after agricultural collectivization, the local nationalist ideological sentiments of some ethnic cadres and the masses have shown a clear rise. For example, excessively emphasizing the particularity of local work; making excessive unreasonable demands on the state; ignoring or refusing to accept the advanced experience and goodwill assistance of advanced regions and advanced ethnic groups. Therefore, for Damiao Mountain, criticizing local nationalism should be given top priority.

### 新疆伊犁自治州、伊宁市和喀什市民族干部一致认为　地方民族主义同祖国统一不相容  广西民委开会决定批判大汉族主义和地方民族主义

　  新疆伊犁自治州、伊宁市和喀什市民族干部一致认为
　　地方民族主义同祖国统一不相容
　  广西民委开会决定批判大汉族主义和地方民族主义
    新华社乌鲁木齐30日电　新疆伊犁哈萨克族自治州和伊宁市主要民族领导干部二十多人在日前举行会议，座谈中共中央总书记邓小平在关于整风运动的报告中所提出的“在一切已经基本上实现了生产资料所有制的社会主义改造的少数民族地区和少数民族人口中，应该同样进行社会主义教育，并且适当地进行反右派斗争”的指示，大家在发言中一致拥护在民族干部中开展反右派斗争和批判地方民族主义。
    自治州州长贾和达（哈萨克族）说：全国各地已经开展了整风运动和反右派斗争，我们伊犁哈萨克族自治州也不能例外。中央提出要在整风运动和反右派斗争中，着重批判地方民族主义，这是完全正确的、必要的。有的人认为：整风和反右派是汉族干部的事，这种看法是错误的，必须纠正。自治州民族干部中有官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义，也有右派分子，而且近几年来地方民族主义也有一些抬头。因此，我们必须坚决根据中央的指示，把整风运动开展起来。民族负责干部必须积极认真地参加和领导这一运动，在党的统一领导下进行工作，这样，我们才能有统一的思想和行动，才能避免发生错误。
    自治州副州长阿不都热衣木艾沙（维吾尔族）说，在少数民族中进行整风和适当地进行反右派斗争的指示是正确的，我们必须坚决贯彻执行。自治州几年来进行了一系列的政治运动，各族人民和干部的社会主义觉悟大大提高，各地建立了党组织。因此，在自治州进行整风和适当地进行反右派斗争的条件是完全具备的。我们历次的政治运动，并不是所有的人都满意的。有些人反对和仇视共产党，趁着共产党整风的机会来反对共产党反对社会主义。他们披着民族利益代表者的外衣，夸大我们民族工作中的缺点，挑拨和煽动各民族间的不和，破坏民族团结和祖国的统一。对这样的坏分子不进行批判和斗争，对于祖国的社会主义建设是不利的。近几年来在自治州的民族知识分子中，地方民族主义思想又有了一些抬头。这是有害于民族团结，也是有害于本民族的发展的。所以，我们在整风中要坚决地反对地方民族主义倾向。
    自治州公安局局长奴古雪天（哈萨克族）说，近几年来，地方民族主义思想有了新的滋长。如有人叫嚷要“民族独立”，成立“东土耳其斯坦”，成立一个民族党，排斥汉族干部和汉族群众。在这些人中间，有的是以民族问题为借口，反对共产党的领导；有的是别有用心地破坏民族的团结和祖国的统一。地方民族主义是资产阶级民族主义思想的一个重要方面，对民族团结有着很大的危害性。我们要走社会主义道路，就必须要有各民族的团结和祖国的统一，更重要的是要有共产党的领导。反对党的领导、制造民族分裂、破坏祖国的统一，就是少数民族的灾难。因此，在少数民族中进行整风和适当地开展反右派斗争，有着非常重大的意义。
    座谈会上，自治州副检察长哈拉提拜（哈萨克族）、自治州人民法院院长夏衣马尔旦（哈萨克族）、中共伊宁市委副书记巴斯提（维吾尔族）、州文教卫生系统党委书记库得克（哈萨克族）、伊宁市市长哈山诺夫（维吾尔族）等在发言中一致强调在整风运动中结合反对地方民族主义倾向，有着十分重要的意义，并表示要积极地领导开展这一运动。
    新华社喀什30日电　新疆维吾尔自治区喀什市在最近召集的三级干部会议上，本地民族干部热烈发言，揭露和批判目前在一些干部和知识分子中存在的地方民族主义思想。
    会议上提供的各项材料证明，喀什市各族人民八年来在共产党的领导下，取得了民主革命和社会主义革命的胜利，各民族干部和群众经过多次政治运动的锻炼，提高了觉悟，大多数人都积极拥护共产党，坚决走社会主义道路。但是近一、二年来，在某些少数人中间，地方民族主义却有了一定的滋长，并有扩展的趋向，特别是在大鸣大放时期，一些资产阶级分子和地主分子打着热爱民族的幌子，煽动群众，挑拨民族关系，诬蔑党的民族政策，向共产党向社会主义进行了疯狂的进攻，企图破坏祖国的统一和各民族的团结。他们把一些汉族干部在党委担任领导工作，说成自治区是有名无实，排斥汉族干部和一切外来干部，要汉族干部回到内地去，并煽动群众说：“喀什大米少了，桃子贵了，都是被汉族干部吃光了。”甚至当汉族工程师领导民族工人修一座公路桥时，他们也把这说成是“汉族人高高在上的统治着，驱使维吾尔族人做笨重活。”
    会议上暴露的材料说明，除了极少数反对共产党、反对社会主义的资产阶级分子和地主分子披着民族的外衣向共产党进攻以外，由于有些干部还没有树立起正确的共产主义民族观，某些领导干部存在着“只要反对大汉族主义就万事大吉”的看法，因而使资产阶级民族主义的言论找到了一些市场。
    参加会议的维吾尔等民族干部热烈认真地批判了这些地方民族主义倾向，并一致指出地方民族主义是分裂祖国统一，破坏各民族团结和社会主义建设的毒剂，是同无产阶级民族观、同马克思列宁主义根本不相容的。民族干部们还列举出许多事例证明，喀什市近年来的巨大变化和各族人民幸福的生活，都是和中国共产党的领导，全国各族人民的支援帮助，特别是汉族人民的支援和帮助分不开的，绝大多数汉族干部都是远离家乡忠心耿耿地来到边疆为少数民族人民服务的，并受到了少数民族干部和群众的欢迎。地方民族主义者在这方面的言论，完全违背了少数民族人民的根本利益。
    经过揭露和批判，参加会议的本地民族干部普遍进一步认识了地方民族主义的反动实质和危害性，一致表示要和地方民族主义作坚决的斗争。喀什市市长吐地尤夫说：“只有彻底揭露资产阶级民族主义，更进一步加强各民族的团结，才能使社会主义的建设事业大步前进。”
    据新华社南宁25日电　广西省民族事务委员会最近召开专、市、县民委主任会议，部署在广西省民族地区结合整风运动，批判大汉族主义和地方民族主义。
    参加这次会议的民委主任对批判两种民族主义提出了具体做法：在各地中共党委统一领导下，在今冬明春结合各县整风运动，在干部和群众中开始大鸣大放，结合批判民族主义。批判的方式方法，应该各民族自我检查、批判（在群众中着重进行正面教育），提高思想认识，达到民族团结。
    许多民委主任在会上发言，说明着重批判地方民族主义的必要性。苗族自治县县长梁彬（苗族）说，大苗山过去批判这两种民族主义思想，主要是批判大汉族主义而忽视批判地方民族主义。当然，过去强调批判大汉族主义是对的，今后也仍然要坚决批判大汉族主义。但是，过去对地方民族主义思想批判不够。因此，在农业合作化以后，有些民族干部和群众的地方民族主义思想情绪已有明显的抬头。例如，过分地强调当地各项工作的特殊性；向国家提出过多的不合理的要求；忽视或拒绝接受先进地区和先进民族的先进经验和善意帮助。所以，在大苗山来说，批判地方民族主义应放在首要地位。
