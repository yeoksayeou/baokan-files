Use Your Brain to Find Ways to Break Through New Quotas
	Summary of Speech by Representative Ying Zhongfa (Technician at Shanghai No. 2 Textile Machinery Factory)
　　The Shanghai No. 2 Textile Machinery Factory was just a dilapidated textile machinery parts repair shop at the time of liberation. At that time, it could only make some general parts. The Kuomintang reactionaries once wanted this factory to manufacture 12,000 old-fashioned spindles. After spending more than two years, they still couldn't do it successfully, and they lost money every year. But once this factory was in the hands of the working class, it turned over. When the first Five-Year Plan began, our factory had become a manufacturer of large quantities of fine spinning machines. The fine spinning machines we manufactured have been exhibited at international exhibitions and have won praise. In addition to cotton spinning machines, our factory also manufactures twisting machines and doubling machines. Now we have successfully designed fine wool spinning machines, which are expected to be officially put into production during the second Five-Year Plan.
　　I remember in 1953, when the motherland entered the first Five-Year Plan, I was elected as the union group leader. This group was originally the Lu Agou group, which was the advanced banner of the entire factory. At that time, it happened that the union called on everyone to formulate personal guarantee conditions based on the operation plan. This was a new thing, and some workers didn't understand it, thinking, "What's the point of making a plan? Haven't we been producing well without an operation plan?" New things always encounter some difficulties. After I discussed it with the activists in the group, we separately publicized the importance of the operation plan to all comrades in the group. Then, after discussing with the foreman, we reallocated the work according to the strengths of each group member. We asked the Youth League group leader to focus on cultivating a female worker (Youth League member) to first formulate a sample of personal guarantees and introduce it at the group meeting. This promoted the entire group. As a result, our group began to carry out production rhythmically according to the operation plan.
　　In the fourth quarter of 1953, the task assigned to us by the workshop increased by 30% compared with the third quarter, that is, 450 more workdays were required. With 42 people in the group, each person had to increase by more than ten workdays. To complete these tasks, it was not enough to just rely on physical strength. We remembered what the All-China Federation of Trade Unions pointed out: pay attention to improving technology, improving technology, learning and mastering new technologies, and everyone using their brains to find tricks. But many people always felt that there were not so many tricks? Or they thought that the tricks had already been found in the previous quarter. After I asked the union comrades to tell the story of Wang Chonglun, everyone proposed to learn from Wang Chonglun and expressed that they must complete the task of increasing production and practicing economy, and put forward friendly challenges to all groups in the factory and brother factories. What about me? I am a union group leader. I remember what the outstanding Soviet union group leader, Gimosina, said: "You know, I am a union group leader, and I must play an exemplary role in labor. Is it okay for others to reach high indicators and I fall behind?!" Of course not! I strictly demand myself and want to lead everyone with practical actions. I am a fitter, repairing tools every day. How do I start using my brain? I remembered Comrade Lu Agou saying that some Soviet machines were still from the Tsarist era. The outer shell was very old, but the machine parts were constantly innovated, so production efficiency continued to increase. So, I also wanted to transform several punching press molds into semi-automatic and automatic ones. I constantly consulted with master workers and technicians, and pondered day and night. Finally, I improved two sets of semi-automatic punching dies, each of which increased output by three and a half times, and ensured quality and safety. On the basis of the successful completion of the task of increasing production and practicing economy, we revised the quotas, and all 130 processes of all parts were increased by more than 50% compared with the original.
　　With the development of the movement to increase production and practice economy in the factory, the enthusiasm for socialist competition became higher and higher, but the labor intensity of some processes was very high, such as the fender hemming process. Both hands and feet had to move simultaneously and continuously for the product to come out. The female worker who operated it had to stand up and tap her waist after working for a while. I thought that I am a union group leader and have the responsibility to care for the health of the workers, but I couldn't think of a good way to solve this problem. Later, after reading the "Illustrated Manual of Sheet Metal Pressing" written by Soviet comrades, I found several reference drawings of automatic punching devices. I absorbed these principles, and the new mold was finally made successfully. Not only did the operating comrades no longer have sore backs, but also the output increased by 50%.
　　In 1955, after the factory party committee put forward the policy of "improving quality and comprehensively practicing economy," some people in the group thought that we were all doing punching press work, the parts were small, there was nothing to save, and the quality could only be so. Even if we saved a little bit, it wouldn't be done well. I calculated detailed accounts with everyone: the utilization rate of sheet metal pressing in the Soviet Union has reached 75%, while we only have 52%. If we carefully calculate the blanking of each part like a tailor making clothes, we can definitely improve it; at the same time, don't think that our parts are small and it doesn't matter. In fact, scrapping a very small spindle gall spring costs 12 cents, which is equal to a bowl of plain noodles. Little by little, it can become a big current. After everyone understood this principle, they used their brains and overcame operational difficulties, moving large scraps over to punch small parts, and even bending down a little bit of usable scraps to punch "washers." The group also organized technical lectures and, in conjunction with production requirements, learned the Soviet three-inspection system quality inspection method. This greatly improved product quality, reduced the annual scrap rate by 60%, and increased the sheet metal utilization rate to 67%, saving 11,020 kilograms of steel plate material in 14 months.
　　When the All-China Federation of Trade Unions called for carrying out the advanced producer movement, we formulated 26 mentorship, brotherhood, and sisterhood contracts for teaching and learning from each other, helping each other, learning from each other's strengths, and improving together. In a very short period of time, the technical level of the entire group improved, and the original first Five-Year Plan task was completed 17 months and 22 days ahead of schedule. From the perspective of labor productivity, in January 1953, the entire group manufactured 25 kinds of parts, and the working hours required for each machine tool were 92.16 hours. By June 1956, the number of parts had increased to 47, and each machine tool only required 31.65 hours. In the past three years, the number of parts increased by 21, and the tasks increased year by year, but the machine tool equipment not only did not increase, but instead squeezed out two punching presses to support other groups. Parts with large batches and small volumes were basically changed to semi-automatic molds.
　　In order to adapt to the needs of production development, we reorganized the organization, and I was also promoted to technician. But I still don't want to give up the glorious title of union activist, and I am determined to maintain the honor of being advanced in production and not be willing to fall behind others. In the past five years, I have proposed and implemented 50 rationalization proposals, which have played some role in improving quality and ensuring safe production. In terms of increasing output, it ranged from 50%, two times to 16 times. Before this year's National Day, I and several comrades studied the advanced experience of the Soviet Vorodoshav and improved the edgeless blanking die, increasing output by more than 30 times and solving the key problem of waiting for materials in the workshop. The achievement of these results is the result of the party's training and encouragement, and the crystallization of collective wisdom. From 1953 to the present, our entire factory has put forward 6,469 rationalization proposals, saving a value of 1,460,052 yuan, and promoted 119 advanced experiences at the same time. The first Five-Year Plan target was fully completed one year and nine days ahead of schedule. The current spinning machines can spin 60 to 80 count yarn, which can not only meet the needs of new factories in China, but also be exported in large quantities.

　　动脑筋想办法突破新定额
    应忠发代表（上海第二纺织机械厂技师）发言摘要
    上海第二纺织机械厂，刚解放时是一家破烂的纺织机械零件修配厂，当时只能做些一般的零件，国民党反动派曾经想要这个厂制造一万二千枚老式锭子，花了二年多时间，还是做不成功，年年亏本，但这个厂子一到工人阶级手里，就翻了个身，当第一个五年计划开始的时候，我们的厂已经变成一个大量出产精纺机的制造厂了。我们制造的精纺机，在国际展览会上展出过并博得好评。除了棉纺机以外，我厂还制造了拈丝机、并丝机，现在又设计成功精毛纺机，预计在第二个五年计划中正式投入生产。
    记得在1953年，祖国进入第一个五年计划的时候，我被推选为工会小组长。这个小组原来是陆阿狗小组，是全厂的先进旗帜。当时正碰上工会号召每个人根据作业计划订出个人保证条件。这是一件新的事情，有的工人思想不通，认为“订什么计划，没有作业计划不是也生产得蛮好吗？”新的事情总会遇到一些困难，我和小组里的积极分子商量以后，就分别向全组同志宣传作业计划的重要意义。再同工长研究，根据各个组员的特长重新调配了工作。请团小组长重点培养了一个女工（团员）先订出个人保证的样板，在小组会上介绍，这样就推动了全小组。于是，我们的小组就开始按作业计划有节奏地进行生产了。
    在1953年的第四季度，车间交给我们的任务比第三季度增加了30％，即要增加四百五十个工作日。全组四十二人，每人要增加十多工，要完成这些任务，光拼体力是不行的。我们想起中华全国总工会所指出的：注意提高技术、改进技术、学习和掌握新技术，大家动脑筋、找窍门的方向，可是许多人总觉得哪里有那样多的窍门呢？或者是认为窍门在上一季度已经找光了。我就请工会的同志来讲王崇伦的故事后，大家提出了要向王崇伦学习，表示一定要完成增产节约的任务，并向全厂各小组和兄弟厂提出了友谊的挑战。我呢？我是一个工会小组长，记得苏联的优秀工会小组长吉莫什娜讲过：“要知道，我是工会小组长，必须在劳动中起模范作用，要别人达到高度的指标，自己落在后面行吗？！”当然不行！我严格要求自己，要以实际行动来带动大家。我是一个钳工，每天修配修配工具，从何着手动脑筋呢？我想起了陆阿狗同志说，苏联有些机器还是沙皇时代的，外壳很陈旧，但机件内脏却不断革新，所以生产效率不断提高。于是，我也想把几个冲床模子改成半自动化和自动化。我不断请教老师傅、技术员，日夜思索，终于改进了两副半自动冲模，产量各提高三倍半，并保证了质量和安全。在增产节约任务胜利完成的基础上我们修改了定额，全部零件一百三十道工序都比原来的提高了50％以上。
    随着全厂增产节约运动的开展，社会主义竞赛的劲头越来越高，但有些工序的劳动强度很高，如叶子板卷边工序，两只手两只脚都要同时不断动作，产品才能出来，操作的那位女工，做一会儿就要站起来敲敲腰，我想自己是工会小组长，有责任关心工人的健康，可是，想不出好的办法解决这一问题。后来看了苏联同志写的“钣料压制法图解”，找出几个自动打出装置的参考图样，把这些原理吸收过来，新的模子终于做成功了，不只操作的同志再不会腰酸背痛，并且产量也提高了50％。
    1955年厂党委提出“提高质量、全面节约”的方针后，小组里有人认为我们都是干冲床生活的，零件小，既没有什么可以节约，质量也只能如此，即使节约一点点也弄不好了。我就同大家一起算细账：苏联对钣压制的利用率已达到75％，而我们只有52％，如果我们把每种零件落料像裁缝师傅做衣裳一样的精打细算，一定还可以提高；同时，不要以为我们零件小无所谓，实际上报废一只很小的锭胆弹簧就要一角二分，等于一碗阳春面，一点一滴，汇集起来能成大流。这个道理大家懂得后就开动了脑筋，克服操作上的困难，把大的边料移过来冲小的零件，还有一点点可用的边料也拗下来冲“华司”。小组里又组织技术讲座，并配合生产要求学习了苏联三检制的质量检验法，这就使产品质量大大提高，全年报废率降低了60％，钣料利用率提高到67％，十四个月中节约钢板材料一万一千零二十公斤。
    当全总号召开展先进生产者运动时，我们根据“互相学习、互相帮助、取长补短、共同提高”的原则，订立了二十六份包教包学、互教互学的师徒、兄弟、姊妹合同，在很短的时间内，全组的技术水平有所提高，提前了十七个月零二十二天完成了原定的第一个五年计划任务。从劳动生产率来看，1953年1月全组制造二十五种零件，每台机床所需工时为九十二点一六小时，到1956年6月，零件增加到四十七种，每台只需三十一点六五小时，三年多来零件增加二十一种，任务年年加多，但机床设备不仅没有增加，反而压缩出两台冲床，支援别的小组，凡是批量大、体积小的零件，基本上都改用半自动化的模子了。
    为了适应生产发展的需要，我们改编了组织，我也被提升为技师。但是我仍然不愿放弃工会积极分子这个光荣称号，在生产上决心保持先进的荣誉，不甘落于别人的后面。五年中我提出并实现的合理化建议有五十件，对提高质量保证安全生产起了一些作用，提高产量方面从50％、二倍到十六倍。今年国庆节前夕我与几位同志一起学习苏联伏罗多沙夫先进经验，改进无边落料冲模，提高产量三十多倍，解决了车间等工待料的关键问题。这些成绩的获得，是党的培养和鼓舞的结果，是集体智慧的结晶，我们全厂从1953年起到目前为止，职工提出合理化建议有六千四百六十九件，节约价值一百四十六万零五十二元，同时推广了先进经验一百一十九件。提前了一年零九天全面完成了第一个五年计划指标，现在的细纱机已能纺六十支到八十支纱，不但可以满足国内新厂需要，而且能大量出口。
