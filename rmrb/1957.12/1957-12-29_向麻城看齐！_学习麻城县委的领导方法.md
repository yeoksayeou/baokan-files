Learn from Macheng!
-- Learning the Leadership Methods of the Macheng County Party Committee
Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

Macheng County achieved a bumper harvest this year, becoming a county with 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu and 800 jin of grain per mu in paddy fields, achieving the targets set by the Agricultural Development Program ten years ahead of schedule. The output of grain and cotton in Macheng County has leaped forward by a large margin. Why was Macheng County able to achieve such a great victory? Is it because they are uniquely blessed? No! Macheng achieved this bumper harvest this year after overcoming two severe droughts. Is it because the soil, climate conditions, or other objective conditions in Macheng are particularly superior? No! Macheng County is a region of half mountains and half plains, and its natural conditions are not very good. So what is the "secret" to their great leap forward in cotton and grain production? Comrade Zhao Jinliang, Secretary of the Macheng County Party Committee, will answer you in his article.

Some places with relatively backward production do not examine the reasons from the leadership's perspective to gain lessons, but instead "blame heaven and earth." They are like some backward elements in Wangji Township, Macheng County, who say: "Cotton doesn't grow tall, always blaming the land." But the cadres of Wangji Township are not like that. They accepted criticism, took measures, corrected shortcomings, and mobilized the masses. In a very short period of time, they transformed their backward state, and the whole township achieved an average yield of 120 jin of ginned cotton per mu this year. For those places with roughly the same natural conditions but backward production, we should say: Heaven is not to blame, earth is not to blame, the masses are not to blame, the leadership is to blame! Countless facts prove that all advanced regions and advanced units are the result of effective and strong leadership. Therefore, the key to changing the backward state of production lies in changing the leadership methods and leadership style of the leading organs.

We believe that the leadership methods of Macheng County are in line with the Central Committee's decision on leadership methods, are correct and advanced leadership methods, are Marxist leadership methods, and are not bureaucratic leadership methods. They adopted the method of the county party committee proposing agricultural production increase targets and mobilizing the masses to discuss and formulate plans, avoiding subjectivism. They adopted the method of leading cadres engaging in experimental fields, realizing the combination of general calls and individual guidance, typical demonstrations, from points to areas, and the mass line of combining leadership and the masses, avoiding bureaucracy and commandism. In this way, from leading cadres to the broad masses, everyone has clear goals to strive for (production increase targets), and everyone gradually learns agricultural production increase technical measures, overcoming difficulties step by step, achieving victory after victory. Leading cadres and the broad masses share weal and woe, are of one heart and one mind, and are full of energy, finally achieving a bumper harvest and a great victory. The peasants of Macheng County have summarized the work style of rural cadres this year as "three less" and "four more." Three less are fewer meetings, fewer empty talks, and fewer hard words (less coercion). Four more are more demonstrations, more practical work, more hardship, and more reasoning. The masses very much like this good style of work, and we hope that all party organizations and cadres at all levels throughout the province will learn this good style. Through the rectification movement, we should eliminate the subjectivism, bureaucratism, and commandism that involve too many meetings, too many empty talks, and too many hard words. Through the method of leading cadres engaging in experimental fields, we will implement participating in production and leading production, so that leadership and the masses are combined. I believe that all places that want to learn from Macheng County in production should first learn the leadership methods of the Macheng County Party Committee. The Macheng County Party Committee believes: "The combination of leadership and the masses, and the unity of the party and the masses are the power for us to achieve a great leap forward in production." This is an absolutely true principle.

In addition, it should also be pointed out that the Macheng County Party Committee's leadership over production in 1957 was very tight, consistent from beginning to end, and not complacent, tight at the beginning and slack at the end. (Some counties such as Hongan, Xiaogan, Xinzhou, Gucheng, Xishui, and Tianmen have also done this, but most counties have not done this, or have not done it well enough.) Because the leading comrades of the county party committee have such drive, they have motivated the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of cadres and people in the county, from formulating plans, implementing the "three guarantees and four to the fields," segmenting inspections, visiting and comparing, making breakthroughs in backward areas, to fighting drought to protect the harvest, and conducting year-end acceptance evaluations and awarding prizes, the whole year is one tense battle after another. This is how the county achieved a great bumper harvest in agricultural production. Unlike some county party committees, which are tight at times and slack at others; they become proud and complacent when they achieve a little success, or become pessimistic and disappointed when they encounter disasters. Some of our county party committees are satisfied with the bumper harvest models of several townships and several cooperatives, and neglect the leadership of backward townships and backward cooperatives, and therefore cannot achieve a balanced increase in production over a large area of the county. The Macheng County Party Committee's method of timely discovering and helping backward townships and backward cooperatives to learn from the advanced is worth learning. It is wrong for leading organs to simply criticize and accuse backward regions or units, and they must be given practical assistance, from strengthening cadres and technical guidance to necessary material support.

Macheng County has issued a challenge to all counties in the province. In 1958, they want to increase the county's cotton output to 130 jin to 150 jin of ginned cotton per mu, and the county's paddy field grain output to 950 jin to 1,000 jin per mu, and explain the basis and measures for increasing production. This is a great leap forward on the basis of a great leap forward. Now, the party organizations and people of Macheng County are enthusiastically carrying out winter production movements mainly focused on water conservancy construction, accumulating and manufacturing fertilizer, and improving soil, and have already begun tense battles to realize the 1958 production plan. Comrades of the various county party committees, do you dare to accept this challenge? Can agricultural production in your area leap forward by a big step? I think people should bravely accept the challenge and conduct friendly competition with Macheng County. In this socialist competition, some counties may surpass Macheng, and many counties may catch up with Macheng. Each county should learn from each other, supervise each other, and advance together. We hope that those relatively backward regions will catch up.

Learn from Macheng! Catch up with and surpass Macheng, should become the battle cry of all counties.

    向麻城看齐！
    ——学习麻城县委的领导方法
    中共湖北省委第一书记  王任重
    麻城县今年取得了大丰收，成为皮棉百斤和水田粮食亩产八百斤的县，提前十年实现了农业发展纲要规定的指标。麻城县粮食和棉花的产量都是跳跃式的向前跨进了一大步。为什么麻城县能够得到这样大的胜利呢？是不是他们得天独厚呢？不！麻城今年是战胜了两次严重干旱才取得丰收的。是不是麻城的土质气候条件或者其他客观条件特别优越呢？不！麻城县是一个半山半平原的地区，自然条件并不很好。那么他们棉粮生产大跃进的“秘诀”是什么呢？麻城县委书记赵金良同志在他写的文章里会给你解答。
    有些生产比较落后的地方，不是从领导上检查原因，取得教训，而是“怨天尤人”。他们像麻城县王集乡的某些落后分子一样：“棉花长不高，老是怪土地”。但是王集乡的干部不是这样，他们接受了批评，采取了措施，纠正了缺点，发动了群众。在很短的时间内，就转变了落后状态，全乡今年实现了平均亩产皮棉一百二十斤。对于那些自然条件大致相同而生产落后的地方，我们应当说：天无过，地无过，群众无过，领导有过！无数的事实证明，一切先进地区，先进单位，都是领导有方，领导有力的结果。因此改变生产落后状态的关键，在于改变领导机关的领导方法，领导作风。
    我们认为麻城县的领导方法是符合中央关于领导方法的决定的，是正确的、先进的领导方法，是马克思主义的领导方法，不是官僚主义的领导方法。他们采取了县委提出农业增产指标，发动群众讨论制订规划的方法，避免了主观主义，采取了领导干部搞试验田的方法、实现了一般号召和个别指导相结合，典型示范，由点到面，领导和群众相结合的群众路线，避免了官僚主义命令主义。这样从领导干部到广大群众都有明确的奋斗目标（增产指标），都逐渐学会了农业增产的技术措施，一步又一步地战胜困难；一个接一个地取得胜利，领导干部和广大群众同甘共苦，同心同德，干劲十足，终于取得了大丰收、大胜利。麻城县的农民把今年农村干部的工作作风总结成为：“三少”“四多”。三少是会议少，空话少，硬话少（强迫少）。四多是示范多，实干多，吃苦多，说理多。群众很喜欢这种良好的作风，我们希望全省从上到下，各级党的组织和干部都学习这种良好作风。通过整风运动去掉那些会议多、空话多、硬话多的主观主义、官僚主义、命令主义。通过领导干部搞试验田的办法，实行参加生产领导生产，使领导和群众相结合。我认为一切要想在生产上向麻城县看齐的地方，应当首先学习麻城县委的领导方法。麻城县委认为：“领导和群众相结合，党和群众一心一意是我们取得生产大跃进的力量”。这是千真万确的真理。
    此外，还应当指出麻城县委1957年对生产的领导，抓得很紧，一贯到底，不是麻痹自满，前紧后松。（还有红安、孝感、新洲、谷城、浠水、天门等一部分县，也是这样做的，但是，多数县还没有这样做，或者做得还不够好。）由于县委领导同志有这样一股干劲，带动了全县广大干部和人民群众的积极性和创造性，从制订规划，实行三包四到田，分段检查，参观评比，突击落后，到抗旱保丰收，秋后验收评奖，全年都是一个接一个紧张的战斗；这样才取得了全县农业生产的大丰收。不像有些县委那样，时紧时松；一有点成绩就骄傲自满，或者一遇到灾害就悲观失望。我们有些县委满足于若干乡，若干社的丰产典型，忽视了对于落后乡落后社的领导，因而不能取得全县大面积的平衡增产。麻城县委及时发现和帮助落后乡落后社向先进看齐的方法，是值得学习的。领导机关对于落后地区或单位单纯批评指责是不对的，必须予以切实的帮助，从加强干部、技术指导到必要的物质支援。
    麻城县向全省各县发出了挑战书。他们在1958年要使全县棉花的产量达到亩产皮棉一百三十斤——一百五十斤，全县水田亩产粮食九百五十斤——一千斤，并且说明了增产的根据和措施，这是在大跃进的基础上，再来一个大跃进。现在麻城县的党组织和人民群众正在热火朝天地进行着以兴修水利、积肥造肥和改良土壤为主要内容的冬季生产运动，已经为实现1958年的生产规划而开始了紧张的战斗。各个县委的同志们，你们敢不敢接受这个挑战？你们那里的农业生产能不能向前跃进一大步？我想，人们应当勇敢地接受挑战，和麻城县进行友谊比赛。在这场社会主义竞赛中，有些县可能超过麻城，有许多县可能赶上麻城。各县应当互相学习互相督促共同前进。我们希望那些比较落后的地区赶上来。
    向麻城看齐！赶上并超过麻城，应当成为各县的战斗口号。
