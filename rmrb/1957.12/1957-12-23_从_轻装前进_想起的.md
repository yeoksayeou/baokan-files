    Thoughts Inspired by "Traveling Light"
    Huang Mo

    In the People's Daily of December 13th, there was an essay entitled "Traveling Light" (by Xing Zi). Although the story is short, its meaning is quite profound, especially in today's context, and has practical significance.

    Li Deyou in the story is a person who "has a set of innate abilities for managing life." When he was a soldier, his superiors called for "traveling light." He was not only reluctant to throw away his own things, but also picked up things that others had thrown away and stuffed them into his backpack. It was not until the battle of Linfen that he finally decided to throw away his huge backpack that hindered his progress, volunteered for the assault team, and became one of the first soldiers to break into Linfen. After liberation, Li Deyou was transferred to a local job, got married, and had a family. His old habits returned: buying this today and that tomorrow, arranging his home in an orderly fashion. At this time, his superiors called for going to the countryside to engage in production. He thought about it for a long time, unable to understand, because he was reluctant to part with the home he had built up. Later, he suddenly remembered the past, remembering the story of "traveling light" from before, so he resolved to "travel light" once again for the victory of socialist construction!

    Li Deyou's situation is very common in our lives. Aren't there already hundreds of thousands of people today who, like Li Deyou, have resolutely "traveled light"? A relatively comfortable material life has not become a prison that confines their aspirations, nor has it eroded their revolutionary spirit. Once the motherland issues a call to them, they can go to the battle station like soldiers.

    But there are also a few people who are not like this. They are reluctant to part with the office desk by the window on the fifth floor, reluctant to part with the small room in the dormitory, and all kinds of things crammed into this room – asking them to say goodbye to these things is like taking their lives! For them, the ideal of life and the purpose of life are probably to stay put in a big city, walking from the dormitory to the office, from the department store to the cinema, plus a spouse and children, then they have the entirety of life's joy!

    When talking about such people, people inevitably complain about the comfortable material life, saying that material enjoyment has harmed them; in fact, the fault does not lie in material life, but in themselves. The purpose of our revolution is not to drag humanity backwards, but to build a socialist and communist society with a high degree of material civilization; mankind's material enjoyment will only get better and better, not worse and worse. But people are transforming and building material life while also transforming and building themselves; as material life improves, people's spiritual world becomes richer and broader, and their vision becomes more far-reaching. They will never become slaves to the material life they have created, corrupted by it; instead, their eyes are always looking forward, always being the masters of life. Only those who reap without sowing, like the bourgeoisie, are destined to be corrupted and degenerate. Therefore, those with individualistic thoughts should go to life and labor to temper and transform themselves, so that they are qualified to enjoy it.

    从“轻装前进”想起的
    黄沫
    12月13日的人民日报上，有一篇题为“轻装前进”的散文（作者兴子），故事虽短，寓意却颇深刻，特别是在今天看来，有着现实意义。
    故事中的李德有，是个“有一套天生的过日子的本领”的人。他当战士的时候，上级号召“轻装前进”，他不但舍不得扔下自己的东西，还要拣别人扔下的东西塞进自己的背包。直到后来打临汾的时候，他才终于决心扔下他那个硕大无比的妨碍他前进的背包，报名参加了突击队，成为最先突入临汾的战士之一。解放后，李德有转业到地方，结了婚，有了一个家。他的老脾气又来了：今天买这，明天买那，把个家布置的井井有条。这时上级号召下乡生产，他想了好久，想不通，因为舍不得他经营起来的这个家。后来，他忽然想起以前了，想起了从前“轻装前进”的故事，于是决心为了社会主义建设的胜利，再一次“轻装前进”！
    李德有的情形，在我们生活中很普遍，今天不是已经有成千上万的人，像李德有那样毅然决然地“轻装前进”了吗？比较舒适的物质生活，并没有成为禁锢他们的志向的牢笼，并没有消磨了他们的革命志气，而一旦祖国向他们发出号召，他们就能够像战士一样地走上战斗的岗位。
    可是也还有少数的人不是这样。他们舍不得五层楼上那个靠窗的办公桌，舍不得宿舍里那一间小小的屋子，以及挤满这间屋子的各种各样的东西——要他们和这些东西告别一下，就像要了他们的命一般！对于他们来说，生活的理想、人生的目的，大概就是死守在一座大城市里，每天从宿舍走到办公室，从百货商店走到电影院，再加上爱人、孩子，便有了全部的人生乐趣！
    谈到这样一些人，人们就难免要埋怨舒适的物质生活了，说是物质享受害了他；其实罪过并不在物质生活，而在他自己。我们革命的目的，并不是为了要把人类拖回去，而是为了建设有着高度物质文明的社会主义社会和共产主义社会；人类的物质享受将是越来越好，而不是越来越坏。但是人们在改造和建设物质生活的时候，同时在改造和建设着自己；随着物质生活的提高，人的精神世界也越来越丰富、宽广，眼光越加远大。他们永远不会成为自己创造的物质生活的奴隶，被它所腐化；而是眼光永远向着前面，永远做生活的主人。只有坐享其成的人，如资产阶级，才注定了要腐化堕落的。因此，有个人主义思想的人，更是应该到生活中、劳动中去锻炼改造自己，使自己具备享受它的资格。
