State Council Issues Directive
Strengthen Socialist Transformation of Individual Farmers

(Our dispatch) Beijing, December 21st - The State Council issued the "Directive on Correctly Treating Individual Farmers" on December 21st. The full text is as follows:

After the basic realization of agricultural cooperation, in our country's rural areas, apart from a small number of ethnic minority areas where land reform has not yet been carried out, there are still about 3% of individual farmers. The majority of these individual farmers are wealthy peasants, or farmers who also engage in commerce or handicrafts, or scattered farmers living in remote mountains and forests. There are also some poor farmers who lack labor; in addition, there are a few landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries under surveillance, and vagrants without regular occupations. Because these individual farmers are few in number and extremely dispersed, and because the township and town people's committees have focused their efforts on consolidating agricultural cooperatives in recent years, neglecting their leadership, coupled with the serious capitalist thinking of some of them and the lack of management of free markets in some areas, speculative activities by individual farmers have emerged in many places, violating the state's policy of unified purchase and sale, evading the burden of public grain, and even sabotaging agricultural cooperatives. These illegal acts have had an adverse impact on the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives.

In order to strengthen the unity, education, transformation, and management of individual farmers, the following decisions are now made, and people's committees at all levels should implement them in accordance with the specific conditions of their localities.

(1) For individual farmers, the township and town people's committees may entrust the agricultural cooperatives in or near their locations to conduct education and strengthen leadership according to their different circumstances. Agricultural cooperatives should include individual farmers when convening various relevant meetings of villagers in order to continuously raise their political awareness and enable them to understand and abide by the government's laws and administrative measures in a timely manner.

(2) The entrusted agricultural cooperatives have the responsibility to supervise the production activities, planting plans, taxation, and agricultural product sales of individual farmers. Individual farmers should hand over the taxes and agricultural products they are required to pay and sell to the state to the agricultural cooperative for joint payment and sale to the state. If some individual farmers are unable to transport the goods themselves and need the agricultural cooperative to transport them on their behalf, the individual farmers should reasonably share the actual transportation costs. If individual farmers have arrears or have failed to pay public grain, or have surplus grain and other unified purchase materials that should be sold but have not been sold, the agricultural cooperative has the right, entrusted by the township and town people's committees, to urge them to make up the payment and sale in full. If individual farmers have difficulties in life and need to have their public grain or unified purchase tasks reduced or exempted as appropriate, the agricultural cooperative should truthfully reflect the situation, and the township and town people's committees should handle it in accordance with relevant laws and regulations. If individual farmers buy or sell agricultural products that are subject to state unified purchase or prohibited from free trade in the free market, the agricultural cooperative has the right to stop them. If the prevention is ineffective, it should be reported to the township and town people's committees for handling in accordance with the law.

(3) The entrusted agricultural cooperatives have the responsibility to comprehensively manage the slaughter of livestock and the felling of trees by individual farmers in accordance with the law. If individual farmers slaughter livestock that should not be slaughtered or cut down trees indiscriminately in violation of government regulations, the agricultural cooperative has the right to stop them. If the prevention is ineffective, it should be reported to the township and town people's committees for handling in accordance with the law.

(4) The entrusted agricultural cooperatives may apportion compulsory labor to individual farmers in accordance with the regulations of the State Council and local people's committees; they may also apportion labor and funds needed for the construction of public water conservancy projects or the undertaking of other public welfare undertakings related to them in accordance with the covenants of the entire village.

Individual farmers may jointly use public water conservancy facilities with agricultural cooperatives and be jointly responsible for their maintenance. Water conservancy facilities built independently by agricultural cooperatives can also be used by individual farmers with the consent of the agricultural cooperative, as long as the water volume is sufficient. However, individual farmers need to pay an appropriate amount of water fees and participate in the annual repairs and maintenance of these water conservancy projects.

(5) All burdens shared by individual farmers should be handled in accordance with the burdens of cooperative farmers, neither too light nor too heavy. For poor individual farmers, they should also be reduced or exempted accordingly.

(6) Agricultural cooperatives may, in accordance with the principles of voluntary participation and mutual benefit, organize labor assistance between members of agricultural cooperatives and individual farmers or between individual farmers to enable them to continue to develop production. For individual farmers with difficulties in life, agricultural cooperatives, credit cooperatives, banks, and township and town people's committees should give them appropriate consideration in terms of loans and relief.

(7) Agricultural cooperatives should strengthen leadership and education for individual farmers, closely unite them, and strive for their voluntary participation in agricultural cooperatives. Those who are unwilling to join should be allowed to do as they please.

For individual farmers scattered in remote mountains and forests, after the nearby agricultural cooperatives absorb them into the cooperative, they may be allowed to be responsible for their own profits and losses economically, while providing guidance and assistance in production, and strengthening their regular political and ideological education.

(8) For landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries who have not yet been allowed to participate in agricultural cooperative production, the township and town people's committees should entrust the agricultural cooperative to be responsible for supervision and transformation in accordance with relevant laws.

### 国务院发布指示  加强对个体农户的社会主义改造

    国务院发布指示
    加强对个体农户的社会主义改造
    本报讯  十二月二十一日国务院发布“关于正确对待个体农户的指示”。全文如下：
    农业合作化基本实现以后，在我国农村中，除了部分还没有进行土地改革的少数民族地区外，还有百分之三左右的个体农户。这些个体农户多数是富裕农民，或者是兼营商贩或手工业的农户或者是深山远林里居住零散的农户，也还有一部分是缺乏劳力的贫苦农民；另外，还有少数是地主、富农、被管制的反革命分子以及没有正业的游民分子。由于这些个体农户已经为数不多，并且极为分散，又由于乡、镇人民委员会近年来把力量集中在巩固农业合作社方面，疏忽了对他们的领导，加上他们中一部分人资本主义思想严重以及某些地区对自由市场缺乏管理，以致在不少地方出现了个体农户进行投机活动，违反国家的统购统销政策，逃避公粮负担，甚至还对农业合作社进行破坏。这些违法行为对农业合作社的巩固产生了不利的影响。
    为了加强对个体农户的团结教育改造和管理，现在作如下各项决定，各级人民委员会应该根据各地具体情况贯彻执行。
    （一）对于个体农户，乡、镇人民委员会可以委托他们所在地或者附近的农业合作社按照他们本人的不同情况分别进行教育和加强领导。农业合作社召开乡村居民各种有关会议的时候，应该吸收个体农户参加，以不断地提高他们的政治觉悟，并且使他们能及时地了解和遵守政府的法令和行政措施。
    （二）受委托的农业合作社，有责任对个体农户的生产活动、播种计划、纳税和农产品交售进行必要的监督。个体农户应该把向国家应纳的税款和交售的农产品，交给农业合作社一起向国家交纳和出售。如果有的个体农户无力自己运输而需要由农业合作社代为运输的，则应该由个体农户合理地摊纳实际需用的运费。个体农户如有尾欠或者漏交公粮，或者是存有应售而未售的余粮及其他统购物资，农业合作社得根据乡、镇人民委员会的委托，有权督促其照数补交和出售。个体农户因为生活困难，需要酌情减免公粮或统购任务的，农业合作社应该依实反映，由乡、镇人民委员会根据有关的法令和规定处理。个体农户如果在自由市场买卖国家统一收购和禁止自由买卖的农产品，农业合作社有权加以制止，如果制止无效，应该报请乡、镇人民委员会依法处理。
    （三）受委托的农业合作社，有责任对个体农户宰杀牲畜、砍伐树木依法进行全面的管理。个体农户违反政府规定私自宰杀不应宰杀的牲畜或者乱砍树木，农业合作社有权加以制止，如果制止无效，应该报请乡、镇人民委员会依法处理。
    （四）受委托的农业合作社，可以按照国务院和地方人民委员会的规定，向个体农户摊派义务工；也可以按照全村人民的公约，向个体农户摊派兴修与其本人有关的公共水利建设或者兴办其他公益事业所需要的人工和款项。
    个体农户可以同农业合作社共同使用公共的水利建设并且共同负责加以养护。农业合作社自力修建的水利建设，只要水量充足，经农业合作社同意，个体农户也可以参加使用，但是个体农户需要缴纳适当数量的水费并且参加这些水利工程的岁修和养护工作。
    （五）个体农户分摊的一切负担，应该比照合作社农户的负担办理，既不要偏轻，也不要偏重，对于贫苦的个体农户，还应该相应地减免。
    （六）农业合作社，对于在生产上有困难的个体农户，可以根据自愿互利的原则，组织农业合作社社员和个体农户之间或者是个体农户相互之间的劳动互助，使他们能够继续发展生产。对于生活困难的个体农户，农业合作社、信用合作社、银行和乡、镇人民委员会，应该使他们在贷款和救济方面得到适当的照顾。
    （七）农业合作社应该对个体农民加强领导和教育，紧密地团结他们，争取他们自愿地加入农业合作社。凡不愿意加入的，听其自便。
    对于散居在深山远林的个体农户，附近的农业合作社在吸收他们入社以后，可以允许他们在经济上自负盈亏，而在生产上给以指导和扶助，并且加强对他们经常的政治、思想教育工作。
    （八）对于尚未允许参加农业合作社生产的地主、富农和反革命分子，乡、镇人民委员会应该委托农业合作社依照有关法令负责进行监督和改造。
