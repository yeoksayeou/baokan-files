　　Selling Wildcats
　　Old Man Wang is old, but his marksmanship is as good as ever. In less than a day, he shot four wildcats. He thought about carrying them to Changxindian to sell, but suddenly remembered that there were transferred cadres living in Xiaying Village; some were even university teachers, who probably often ate fish and meat. Surely they would be happy to have some game today.
　　He entered the village and inquired, and went into the Zhao family's courtyard. Huh, why are they squatting in the yard eating? Each of them is sweating profusely while eating. Looking at the food, the old man's idea cooled by half. Twenty or so people, each holding a sweet potato in one hand and a cornbread in the other, with two bowls of roughly pickled cabbage on the wooden stools.
　　These university teachers were all very friendly, one calling him "Grandpa," another inviting him to eat. Old Man Wang also squatted down and asked them if they were used to the life here; he also asked how everyone's labor was going, completely forgetting about selling the wildcats.
　　After smoking two pipefuls of tobacco, Old Man Wang carried the wildcats and walked out. He didn't sell the wildcats, but he felt quite happy inside.

　　卖野猫
    王大爷老了，枪法可不亚当年。不到一天，打了四只野猫。有心背到长辛店去卖，忽然想起下营村住着下放干部；有些还是大学教师，平常大概常吃鱼肉，今天一定欢喜野味。
    进了街一打听，就进了赵家院。咦，他们怎么就蹲在院里吃饭，一个个吃得满头大汗，再看那饭菜，大爷的念头就凉了一半。二十来个人，人人一手拿着白薯，一手拿着窝头，木头墩上，还放着两碗暴腌白菜。
    这些大学教师们说话都挺和气，这个叫大爷，那个请吃饭。王大爷也蹲下来问他们生活过得惯不；又问大伙儿劳动得怎么样，根本忘了卖野猫的事儿。
    抽了两锅烟，王大爷才背着野猫走出来。野猫没有卖成，心里倒挺痛快。
