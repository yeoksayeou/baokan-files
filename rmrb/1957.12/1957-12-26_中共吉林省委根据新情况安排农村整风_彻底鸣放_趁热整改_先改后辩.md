    The Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Arranges Rural Rectification Based on New Situation: Thorough Airing of Views, Immediate Rectification, Rectification Before Debate

    (Reported by this newspaper) On the evening of December 16th, the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a telephone conference. Zhang Shiying, the Minister of the Rural Work Department of the Provincial Committee, made specific arrangements for the current rural work in the province on behalf of the Provincial Committee. He pointed out that the current steps for rural rectification should be rectification before debate, and focus on rectification in conjunction with current work.

    **Conditions for Prioritizing Rectification**

    The Provincial Committee believes that after the first batch of extensive debates, the capitalist words and deeds of upper-middle peasants against agricultural cooperativization and the state monopoly of purchase and marketing were refuted, the ideas and behaviors of a few upper-middle peasants who wanted to withdraw from the cooperatives and engage in grain speculation were isolated, and the destructive activities of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements were struck down. Therefore, in the second batch of extensive airing of views, anti-socialist remarks have been greatly reduced, while remarks supporting socialism have prevailed.

    Facts have proved that in the second batch of rural rectification, about 90% of the opinions expressed by the masses were correct or basically correct, and the vast majority of the opinions were well-intentioned, mostly regarding the work style of cadres and the operation and management of agricultural cooperatives. Only a few percent were misunderstandings and incorrect opinions. In this case, it is not necessary to adopt a large-scale debate method to concentrate fire on criticizing the erroneous opinions of a small number of peasants in airing their views. We should seize the opportunity, take advantage of the momentum, rely on the promotion of the masses, and vigorously improve our work, quickly transition to the rectification stage, that is, the stage of rectifying the cooperatives, the Party, and the Youth League. Even if there are some incorrect remarks in the airing of views, we can debate and refute them after the rectification has come to an end.

    **Advantages and Obstacles of Prioritizing Rectification**

    The Provincial Committee believes that there are many benefits to immediately transitioning to rectification after the extensive airing of views. First, 60% to 70% of the poor and lower-middle peasants support cooperativization and are determined to run the cooperatives well, so they actively support prioritizing rectification. Second, prioritizing rectification also makes it easier to win over and unite the majority of middle peasants. Although a few upper-middle peasants do not have confidence in taking the socialist road, running the cooperatives well, and whether rectification can be successful, as long as we are determined to rectify, earnestly solve problems, and improve our work, it will also bring the wavering upper-middle peasants closer to the Party and closer to the agricultural cooperatives. Third, prioritizing rectification before debate is more conducive to further exposing the destructive activities of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements.

    The current difficulties and obstacles in transitioning to the rectification stage are mainly the determination of county and district leaders and the ideological problems of township and cooperative cadres. County and district leaders are afraid that it will not be well integrated with the grain requisitioning work and do not adequately analyze the changes in the second batch of rural rectification. Some township and cooperative cadres also have the idea of rectifying people, fearing that it will backfire, and have insufficient understanding of the fact that rural rectification is mainly to improve work, promote production, and overcome the three major isms. Some people even believe that because not so many anti-socialist remarks were aired in the second batch, it means that the airing of views was not thorough, and they take some inappropriate measures as a result. They neither record nor report the correct opinions raised by the masses in the airing of views, and some pursue some stains on the personal life style of individual peasants. This will also allow some bad elements to take advantage of loopholes and instigate a change of targets, which should be noted and corrected.

    **What to Rectify, What to Improve**

    When rural rectification enters the second stage – the rectification stage – cadres must have a clear understanding of what to rectify and what to improve. The Provincial Committee pointed out that first, we should rectify and improve issues related to current work, such as first criticizing departmentalism and individualism, reporting actual yields, exposing and criticizing the concealment of yields and the private distribution of grain, solving how to quickly organize the transportation of public grain and purchase grain, how to speed up the threshing progress, reduce losses and waste in threshing, and how to promote current water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, and sideline production; second, we should focus on improving the work style of cadres, such as the issue of cadres participating in productive labor, financial procedures, and democratic work style; third, we must improve the problems in the distribution work, such as high production costs, little public accumulation, and a small share for cooperative members, how to implement overall planning and comprehensive consideration, household-by-household arrangements, the issue of contracting work to households or groups, and research on the scale of cooperatives and teams, the decentralization of power between cooperatives and teams, and other operational management issues. In the rectification stage, we must first solve and improve the problems that affect current production and grain requisitioning work, and adopt the method of starting with the easy and then the difficult, picking up sesame seeds first and then embracing watermelons. We should also combine rectification with mobilizing the masses to conduct special airing of views, airing of views on whatever is being rectified. In the rectification work, we must mobilize the masses to launch a high tide of airing of views. Only by fully mobilizing the masses, relying on the masses, and following the mass line can we do a good job in rectification.

    After the rectification comes to an end, we will move to the third stage, namely the stage of large-scale debate (continued airing of views). After the large-scale debate, we will move to the fourth stage, namely the stage of discussing the Forty Articles of the National Programme for Agricultural Development and formulating production plans, and at the same time, we can also combine it with solving the rectification problems that were not solved in the previous stage.

    中共吉林省委根据新情况安排农村整风
    彻底鸣放　趁热整改　先改后辩
    本报讯　12月16日晚，中共吉林省委本月中旬召开了电话会议，省委农村工作部长张士英代表省委在会上对全省当前农村工作做了具体安排。他指出，目前农村整风工作的步骤应当是先整改后辩论，结合当前工作，集中进行整改。
    有条件先整改
    省委认为由于经过第一批大辩论，驳倒了上中农反对农业合作化和统购统销的资本主义言行，孤立了少数上中农的闹退社和搞粮食投机的思想与行为，打击了地主、富农、反革命分子、坏分子的破坏活动。因此，在第二批大鸣大放中，反对社会主义的言论大为减少，而拥护社会主义的言论占了上风。
    事实证明，第二批农村整风中，群众鸣放出来的意见有90％左右是正确的和基本正确的，绝大多数意见都是善意的，大部分都是对干部作风、农业社经营管理方面的意见，只有百分之几是属于误解和错误的意见。这样就可以不必先采用大辩论方式，去集中火力先批判少数农民群众在鸣放中的错误意见。应该抓紧时机乘群众兵临城下、趁热打铁、依靠群众的推动，狠狠地去改进工作，迅速转入整改阶段，即整社、整党整团阶段。即使在鸣放中有若干错误言论，也可以在整改告一段落后，再去进行辩论和批驳。
    先整改的好处和阻碍
    省委认为：大鸣大放后，立即转入整改有很多好处。首先60％到70％的贫农、下中农他们拥护合作化，决心想把社办好的，因此，他们积极拥护先整改。第二，先整改也便于争取团结大多数中农，虽然少数上中农对走社会主义道路、办好合作社，能否整改好还没有信心，但是只要我们能决心整改，认真解决问题，改进工作，也会使动摇的上中农靠近党，靠近农业合作社。第三，先整改后辩论对进一步暴露地主、富农、反革命分子、坏分子的破坏活动更有利。
    目前转入整改阶段的困难和阻碍主要是县、区领导的决心和乡、社干部的思想问题。县、区领导怕与粮食征购工作结合不好，对第二批农村整风情况变化分析不够，乡、社干部也有的存在整人思想，怕引火烧身，对农村整风主要是改进工作、推动生产、克服三大主义认识不足。甚至有的人认为第二批没有鸣放出那么多反社会主义言论，就认为是鸣放不彻底，从而就采取些不适当的做法。对群众在鸣放中提出的正确意见也不记录也不汇报，有的追究个别农民的某些生活作风上的污点，这也会使一些坏分子钻空子，鼓动转移目标，这都应引起注意纠正。
    整什么　改什么
    当农村整风转入第二阶段——整改阶段时候，必须使干部明确认识整什么，改什么？省委指出：首先是整改与当前工作有关的问题。如先批判本位主义、个人主义思想，报实产量，揭发批判隐瞒产量和私分粮食问题，解决如何迅速组织运送公粮和购粮问题，如何加快打场进度，减少打场中损失浪费现象，如何推动当前水利、积肥和副业生产问题；第二，应着重改进干部作风，如干部参加生产劳动问题，财务手续问题，民主作风问题；第三，要改进分配工作中的问题，如生产费用高，公积金留的少，社员分配部分少的问题，如何贯彻统筹兼顾，逐户安排问题，包工包产问题，研究社、队规模，社队分权及其它经营管理问题等。在整改阶段中，必须先解决和改进影响当前生产和征购粮工作中的问题，要采取先易后难，先拣芝麻，后抱西瓜的办法。并结合整改发动群众进行专题鸣放，整什么就发动群众鸣放什么。在整改工作中，必须发动群众掀起一个鸣放高潮，只有充分发动群众，依靠群众，走群众路线，才能搞好整改工作。
    在整改告一段落后，再转入第三阶段，即大辩论阶段（继续鸣放），大辩论后再转入第四阶段，即讨论农业发展纲要四十条制定生产规划阶段，同时还可结合解决前一阶段没解决的整改问题。
