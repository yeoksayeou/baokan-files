    Telegram of Respect to the World Federation of Trade Unions
    To the World Federation of Trade Unions in Prague:
    As the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions successfully concludes, we, representing 16 million members of Chinese trade unions, extend our highest and warmest respects to the World Federation of Trade Unions.
    The Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions was convened at a time when our country has achieved a basic victory in the socialist revolution, the first Five-Year Plan has been successfully overfulfilled, and the second Five-Year Plan is about to begin. The congress summarized the experiences and achievements of China's trade union movement and determined the specific tasks of trade unions in the future. Chinese trade unions will continue to work hard to organize and educate workers and staff, unite the people of the whole country, and build a new socialist China with diligence and thrift.
    The Chinese working class will continue to unremittingly strengthen unity, unification, and mutual support with the working classes of all countries in the world, in order to further support the magnificent anti-colonialist movement and the movement to defend world peace throughout the world, and will strive to implement the resolutions and declarations of the Fourth World Trade Union Congress, and strive to strengthen the unity and unification of the international trade union movement.
                    The Entire Delegation of the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions
　　　　　　　　                            December 12, 1957
