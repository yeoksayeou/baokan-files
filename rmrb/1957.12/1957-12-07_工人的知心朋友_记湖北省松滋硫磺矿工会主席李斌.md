The Workers' Intimate Friend
　　——Remembering Li Bin, Chairman of the Trade Union of Songzi Sulphur Mine in Hubei Province
　　By Our Reporter Cao Baoming
　　This is the Cause of the Party
　　At the end of 1953, Li Bin had just been transferred from the Jingzhou Prefectural Committee to serve as the chairman of the trade union of the Songzi Sulphur Mine. He immediately asked an old worker to take him into the mine to have a look. What kind of hole was this? The tunnel was not even half the height of a table. The workers were all holding wooden oil lamps in one hand, touching the ground with the other, and squatting forward on their feet. Li Bin couldn't walk like that, he could only crawl. As soon as he entered the cave, he felt difficulty breathing and gasped for air; his back was constantly rubbing against the top of the tunnel. After crawling about halfway, he really couldn't take it anymore and shouted, "Let's take a break." Who knew that the old worker leading the way would treat him like a capitalist, and coldly said, "It's still far! If you can't crawl, then go out." If a Communist Party cadre crawled back halfway the first time he entered the mine, what impact would this have on the masses? He hardened his heart: "Even if it kills me today, I will follow you to the end." He crawled like this from ten o'clock in the morning to four o'clock in the afternoon, completing more than thirty working faces. As soon as he came out of the cave, his legs were so sore that he couldn't stand still, and his head, feet, and bare upper body were covered in mud. Many workers gathered around, giggling and asking him, "Does your body hurt?" He just said, "It's okay." Behind him, a young worker shouted, "Ouch, your back is all scraped!" Some workers quickly fetched water and towels for him, and even helped him wash his back. When he went home, because of the wounds on his back and the soreness in his legs, he really couldn't lie down or sit still. The next day, he couldn't even go downstairs.
　　As soon as Li Bin arrived, he heard people introduce that this mine had just been taken over from a capitalist. The entire mine only had a Western-style building made of earthen bricks, and the cadres were all crammed into it for office work and sleeping. All they ate was old cabbage, but this still had to be carried over mountains and ridges from forty miles away. If a child wanted to eat a piece of candy, they had to walk twenty miles of mountain road, taking three or four hours, to go to the market town to buy it. The workers were all working naked in the cave, covered in dirt from head to toe. The workers had no dormitories or sheds, and after working twelve hours a day, they slept next to the sulphur refining pool, and had to tend to the charcoal fire for refining sulphur at night.
　　"Can this work be done?" After experiencing it himself in the mine, he couldn't sleep well for several nights. He thought about requesting a transfer.
　　However, can a Communist Party member retreat in the face of difficulties? If he didn't do it, who would? The Party Secretary, Yan Qigen, was an old cadre he had known since 1948, and was already over fifty years old, but he was still working hard in this mine. He himself had also been moved by the plight of the miners and was determined to change the face of the mine! The workers' enthusiasm in fetching water to wash his back further spurred him on. He heard the words of the industrial minister of the prefectural committee before his departure: "The work in the mountains is very hard. But this is the cause of the Party, and it must be done well!"
　　Establishing Affection with the Masses in Labor
　　After Li Bin convinced himself, he encountered new difficulties: How could the trade union engage in production? He heard that others' experience was to organize production meetings. Coincidentally, some sulphur refining workers could produce more than 130 jin of sulphur a day, but some only produced 110 jin, a significant difference. He immediately convened a production meeting to study the reasons. The workers all said: "The output is high for a few days, and low for a few days, it all depends on luck." "Extracting treasure from the fire, if you're unlucky, you just can't refine sulphur." The more they talked, the more superstitious they became. One worker even said that the reason why his output had not improved for a long time was because a female student had stepped over his sulphur refining pool, bringing bad luck. Of course, Li Bin did not agree with these opinions, but everyone thought that he did not understand the production of the mine, and it was useless to talk, so they all closed their mouths and said nothing, making the meeting end unhappily. After the meeting, he individually chatted with several old workers, and they still believed that "the level of output depends entirely on luck." Later, he discovered that the output of Xiong Taiquan in one workshop was the highest, so he went to him to study. He went to the sulphur refining pool to find him several times. This old worker, who had more than twenty years of experience and a volatile temperament, sometimes turned around and glared at him, and sometimes simply ignored him.
　　What to do? The work experience during the land reform helped him. He changed his style of "wandering around, standing around, and looking around" in the workshop, and went to help the workers with some odd jobs. Xiong Taiquan was repairing the jars for refining sulphur, so he picked up dry charcoal next to him while chatting: "What are the benefits of doing this?" Seeing that he was not putting on airs, Xiong Taiquan replied, "You have to fix the jars well, block the seams, so that the sulphur can go from the bottom and not run off." Xiong Taiquan was starting a fire to refine sulphur, and he also went to split firewood on the side, while asking: "Why do you have to do this?" Xiong Taiquan told him again: "The coal paste (coal mud) should be cleaned up, so it doesn't smother the fire." Gradually, the longer he talked with Xiong Taiquan, the more he summarized Xiong Taiquan's experience of high output: "The jars are fixed well, the seams are blocked tightly, and the coal paste is cleaned up so it doesn't smother the fire." He also discussed this summary with several old workers, and they also thought the summary was not bad. Only then did he convene the second production meeting to promote Xiong Taiquan's experience, and the output quickly and universally increased to an average of 150 jin.
　　Li Bin learned from this: He must put down his airs and establish affection with the masses in labor in order to discover and solve problems, and transform from an outsider into an insider. Therefore, despite the harsh environment of the mine, he also went down with a bare body and a wooden oil lamp, running through every tunnel and every working face. In the cave, while helping the workers load ore and push baskets, he learned about the situation and became familiar with the production. This enabled him to later persuade the workers to "reduce private tunnels and enlarge main tunnels" [Note], increasing the height of the tunnels from one and a half feet to three and a half feet, improving the working environment and increasing production efficiency.
　　Taking the Lead in Overcoming Difficulties
　　Their mine was on the side of a mountain, surrounded by mountains on three sides, and in front of the mine entrance was a large ditch. Every year, they encountered three major difficulties in production. In the harsh winter, the mountains were covered with two feet of snow, and the workers had to carry more than 200 jin of ore and walk on steep slopes. Snow posed a great threat to safe production. Li Bin always personally led cadres to the workshops to sweep snow and pave roads as soon as it was light, and only ate after sweeping, making it very convenient for the workers to start production. In late autumn and early winter, the water sources in the mountains dried up, and they had to go down the mountain to fetch water. One year, there was a drought, and the workers went over the mountains and ridges to fetch water five miles away. There was a very narrow steep slope on the road, nine hundred steps, and if they were not careful, they would fall off the cliff with the bucket. Their daily production and domestic water consumption required more than 2,000 loads, and the water carriers could not keep up no matter how busy they were. Li Bin also personally went to carry water, driving many cadres and workers to carry water. In the sweltering summer rainstorms, the water from all the mountains flowed into the large ditch in front of the mine, and at any time there was a danger of flooding the mine and stopping production. Li Bin also inspected the situation on the mountain day and night to prevent flash floods.
　　One summer night two years ago, there was thunder, lightning, and heavy rain. The flood pouring straight down from the high mountains made the whole mountain rumble and the mountain slopes slippery and difficult to walk on. After 11 o'clock, Li Bin and the trade union cadre Zhou Jiemin were still patrolling the workshops with umbrellas. As soon as they arrived at the entrance of No. 2 cave of Workshop 1, they found that the ditch in front was blocked by slag piles. The rapidly rising mountain water flowed back and flowed into the mine. It was only a foot away from sealing the cave entrance, while there were more than 30 workers in the cave producing. A serious accident was about to occur! He hurriedly dropped his umbrella, told Zhou Jiemin to guard the cave entrance, and stumbled to the workers' dormitory on the mountain and shouted: "Get up quickly and drain the water!" With one shout, the workers came with rakes and hoes. He also asked people to go down into the cave to call the 30 or so people, while leading the way in digging ditches in the heavy rain. Half an hour later, they dug three large ditches, and the mountain water receded rapidly. No. 2 cave continued to produce normally the next day.
　　How to Treat Small Matters of Life
　　Since the second half of 1955, their production has fundamentally improved. They have successively used reward funds to build more than 4,300 square meters of dormitories, and the provincial trade union has also invested here to build a workers' club. The workers reflected: "A street has been built in the deep mountains." In this way, there should be no problem with the workers' lives, right? But the workers of Workshop 2 had just moved into the new building and reported to him: "There are not enough toilets, we have to find a solution." He thought: "Why are you looking for me for such a small matter as toilets!" He didn't pay attention. Later, the workers came to him again and took him to see. He saw that more than 150 people lived together, and there were only two squatting places in the toilet, which was indeed too few. He passed the opinion on to the administration, but the administration did not solve it either. The third time, the workers criticized at the staff and workers' congress: "Try going to the toilet every morning." This aroused his vigilance, and he quickly urged the administration to spend dozens of yuan to add a toilet. When the workers saw him, they happily said: "It's good to make suggestions, the toilet problem has been solved." However, some workers were not hygienic, and there was poop and pee all over the toilet. One day, he pulled the secretary of the Youth League and said: "Let's take the lead and clean the toilet." The secretary of the Youth League swept the floor, and he sprinkled lime. Then the Party secretary and the manager also came to help. They cleaned it up in a few strokes, and also put a broom by the door, with a very witty sign: "Aim and shoot, pay attention to hygiene." In this way, the workers also consciously maintained cleanliness.
　　After dealing with daily affairs every morning, Li Bin always went to the workers' dormitory to visit some sick workers and help them solve their difficulties. Once, Liu Xingdian, a sulphur carrier, was sick and covered with two quilts, lying there with tears in his eyes. Li Bin asked: "Have you taken medicine?" Liu Xingdian said: "There is no water." "Why don't you go pour it?" "I can't walk, and there is no one." Li Bin immediately went to the next door to bring boiling water, helped him up to take the medicine, and then made him a bowl of sugar water to drink, and then covered him with a quilt. More than an hour later, Li Bin was not at ease. He came to see him again and saw that he had a higher fever. He hurriedly found the trade union chairman of the workshop, and the two helped him to the clinic. Liu Xingdian was still very excited when he mentioned this afterwards: "This is even better than being taken care of at home. If you don't work hard to produce, you will be sorry."
　　In April this year, more than half of the workers in the mine had the flu. The medical staff was too busy. Li Bin also organized the trade union cadres and activists, personally took the lead as nurses, brought water and food to the patients, told them to take medicine, and put them to bed, busy for more than a month.
　　In dealing with living problems, Li Bin did not give the masses whatever they asked for. In the third quarter of this year, some workers in Workshop 2 believed that production was good, and the thatched houses (part of the workers' dormitory) built in early 1954 should be converted into tiled houses. However, the entire mine only had 4,000 yuan of reward funds left this year, and the administration also planned to use it to convert the thatched shed used for production at the mine entrance into a tiled house. There was a conflict between the workers' demands and the leaders' intentions. Li Bin handed this problem over to the staff and workers' congress for discussion. The representatives debated very enthusiastically. Some said: "Sleeping in a thatched house, if there is a fire in the middle of the night, and there is little water, it is easy to have an accident." Some said: "If the thatched shed in front of the cave entrance catches fire, and the sulphur smoke is fumigated, none of the people in the cave can get out. It's more dangerous!" In this way, everyone agreed that this part of the workers' dormitory would not be rebuilt temporarily, and the money would be used to rebuild the production plant at the cave entrance. The workers also further clarified the relationship between production and life, and set off a wave of striving to overfulfill the annual production plan.
　　Educating and Cultivating a New Generation
　　Their mine only had more than 200 people in 1953, but by the second half of 1955, it had developed to 1,000 people, with many new workers. Most of these workers came from nearby villages, and they had a very popular saying at the time: "When busy, farm at home, and when idle, go up the mountain to earn some money for oil and salt. If it weren't for the money, why would I come to the mine?" When they became fixed workers, they still held this attitude. How to conduct socialist and communist education for these new workers became a major task of the trade union.
　　In addition to general propaganda and education, Li Bin paid close attention to rooting and connecting with these new workers and cultivating activists.
　　Peng Lirong, a miner he personally cultivated, was a young worker from a poor peasant family and was very honest. But his biggest shortcomings at the time were: he didn't attend meetings, he went to bed after eating, and his production was neither backward nor forward. Li Bin told him in the workshop: "Old Peng, after get off work, let's talk carefully." He "Um" said a word, and then stopped talking. But when Li Bin went to the dormitory to find him, cough, he lay on the bed and said: "I am tired today, I want to sleep." He refused Li Bin like this no less than ten times.
　　However, Li Bin had already inquired clearly: his family had a large population and life was difficult. His father told him: "Go to the mine and bring back more money to support the family." His uncle, Peng Yiqing, was an old worker in the mine. In the old days, he broke his leg while working and was driven away by the capitalist, making it impossible for his family to live. His wife left him, and he begged for food. It was not until after liberation that the people's government helped him to bring his wife back and reunite the family.
　　Therefore, Li Bin still took every opportunity to talk to him, asking him how old he was, how many people were in his family, and how was his life. He always answered one sentence for every question. When asked whose mine it was, he also answered: "I don't know, just work and get money." The two gradually became familiar. Li Bin asked him: "How many brothers does your father have?" He said: "Two or three." "Where is your uncle?" "The lame one in the mine is my uncle." "How did he become lame?" "The capitalist broke it." "Why didn't he get medical treatment?" "He didn't even have food to eat, how could he get medical treatment!" "Why didn't you give him medical treatment?" "We can't even protect ourselves, we don't have money to give him medical treatment." "Alas, it would be great if it were like now." "What else is there to say now? The government is so good!" Seeing that he was conscious, Li Bin explained to him the two social systems and the Communist Party, and carried out positive education. Later, Peng Lirong asked him to help fill out the form to join the trade union, and he did not miss the opportunity: "Such a handsome young man, can't even write?" "I haven't studied!" "Why didn't you study in the past?" "My father didn't even have food to eat, how could he afford to send me to school?" Constantly inducing him to recall the past, comparing the present, and inspiring his class consciousness.
　　Gradually, the twenty-year-old Peng Lirong became active in all aspects of work and study. The workers elected him as the trade union group leader, and he did a good job of collecting membership fees and asking people to attend meetings. At this time, Li Bin helped him summarize his operating experience in mining, increasing the output from 1,400 jin per person per day to 2,000 jin. Li Bin also helped him to summarize the operating experience of Gao Guangzhong and others, extending the service efficiency of a sieve from washing 42,000 jin of ore to 70,000 jin. Teaching him various working methods. He was later also selected as a third-class model worker and went to the county to attend meetings.
　　Last year, during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, Peng Lirong and three workers left production to run around in major cities for several months. After the three returned to the mine, they said: "I would rather take a few less wages than leave production to be a cadre." However, as soon as Peng Lirong came back, Li Bin educated him and asked him to return to the group to produce. He did not say anything, and went to the mine to mine the next day, and even though his hands were blistered, he still persisted. This year, when the flu attacked the mine, many cadres fell ill, and he left production to engage in workshop leadership work for more than a month. But when the production order returned to normal, he returned to the group to produce.
　　After Li Bin's long-term help and education, Peng Lirong has now become the deputy secretary of the Party branch and the labor insurance committee of the trade union in Workshop 1, but he still does not leave production, and his production and political work are done very well. He has also cultivated many activists such as Chen Liangzhen and Yi Shaolin. Chen Liangzhen was also elected by the workers as the production team leader and joined the Party.
　　After nearly four years of effort, Li Bin has already achieved: He can tell the names, family situations, and labor situations of more than 800 of the 1,060 workers in the entire mine. His work experience has aroused the interest of trade union cadres throughout Hubei Province. He was elected as a representative to attend the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions.

　　[Note] In the past, this mine opened a tunnel for each person, and they called this kind of tunnel a "private tunnel." Private tunnels were only one and a half feet high, making it difficult for people to move around, but if they were all increased to three and a half feet high, there was not enough manpower. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce "private tunnels" and concentrate manpower to enlarge the main tunnels to improve the working environment.

　　工人的知心朋友
　　——记湖北省松滋硫磺矿工会主席李斌
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    这是党的事业
    1953年年底李斌刚由荆州地委机关调到松滋硫磺矿担任工会主席，便叫个老工人领他进洞去看看。这算什么窿洞呢？巷道还没有桌子一半高。工人们都是一手端着木油灯，一手着地，两脚一前一后蹲着走。李斌不会这样走，只会爬。刚进洞，他就感觉呼吸困难，气直喘；背也不断擦着顶板。大约爬了一半路，他实在有点吃不消，就叫道：“休息一下。”谁知领路的老工人把他当资本家看待，冷冷地说：“还远哩！你爬不来，就出去。”共产党的干部头次进矿就半途爬回去了，这会在群众中造成什么影响？他把心一横：“今天就是拼了命，也要跟着你爬到底。”他就这样从上午十点钟爬到下午四点，爬完了三十多个工作面。刚出洞，他两腿酸痛的站不稳，连头带脚和光着的上身都擦满了泥。许多工人嘻嘻哈哈地围拢来，问他：“身上痛不痛？”他刚说：“还好。”背后就有个青工喊道：“哎哟，背都擦破了！”一些工人连忙给他打水、拿毛巾，还帮助他洗背。他回家去，因为背上有伤和两腿酸痛，真是躺也躺不住，坐也坐不住。到了第二天，他还下不了楼。
    李斌一来就听人介绍过：这座矿是刚由资本家那里接手过来的。全矿就只有一座土砖砌的西式楼房，干部们都挤在里面办公、睡觉。他们吃的全是老白菜，但这还是从四十里外爬山越岭挑来的。小孩要吃颗糖，也得走二十里山路，走上三四个钟头，到集镇上去买。工人们都是赤着身子在洞里干活，浑身上下都是土。工人们没有宿舍，也没有工棚，一天干完十二小时后，就睡在炼磺池边，夜里还要招呼炼磺的炭火。
    “这工作能干得了？”他亲自进洞体会一番以后，一连几夜都睡不好觉。他想请求调动工作。
    但是，一个共产党员能在困难面前退缩么？自己不干让谁干？党委书记阎起根是他1948年就认识的老干部，已经五十多岁了，但人家还在这矿上干的挺起劲。他自己也曾经为矿工们的困苦生活激动过，决心要改变矿山的面貌！工人替他打水洗背的热情，更鞭策着他。他耳边响起了地委工业部长在他临行前谈的话：“山里工作很苦。但这是党的事业，一定要搞好！”
        在劳动中同群众建立感情
    李斌说服了自己以后，又遇到新的困难：工会怎样搞生产？他听说别人的经验是组织生产会议。正好，炼磺工人有的一天能出一百三十多斤硫磺，但有的才出一百一十斤，相差悬殊。他马上召集生产会议研究原因。工人们都说：“产量是一人高几天，低几天，全凭运气。”“火中取宝，运气不好，就是炼不出磺来。”后来越说越邪门，有个工人竟说他的产量长期提不高的原因，是有个女学生跨了他的炼磺池，倒了霉。李斌当然不同意这些意见，但是，大家认为他不懂矿上的生产，说也没用，都闭口不讲了，弄得会议不欢而散。他会后又找几个老工人个别扯谈，他们仍然认为“产量高低，全凭运气”。后来，他发现一工场熊太权的产量最高，便去找他研究。他一连去炼磺池边找了几次，这个有二十多年工龄而性情暴躁的老工人，有时转过身来瞪他一眼，有时干脆理也不理。
    这咋办呢？土改时期的工作经验帮助了他。他改变了下工场“转转、站站、看看”的作风，去帮助工人干些零星活。熊太权在修补炼磺的坛子，他就在旁边拣枯炭，同时扯谈：“这样做有啥好处？”熊太权见他没有架子，也就回答说：“要把坛子整好，缝子堵塞，磺才从下边走，不跑散。”熊太权在生火炼磺，他也去一边劈柴火，一边问：“为啥要这样做？”熊太权又向他讲：“煤巴（煤泥）搞利索些，不霉火。”慢慢地，他同熊太权谈的时间长了，也就总结出了熊太权产量高的经验：“坛子整好，缝子堵紧，煤巴搞利索些，不霉火。”他又把这个总结同几个老工人研究，他们也认为总结的不差。他这才召集第二次生产会议，推广熊太权的经验，产量很快就普遍提高到平均一百五十斤。
    李斌从这里得出了经验：必须放下架子，在劳动中同群众建立感情，才能发现问题，解决问题，从外行变为内行。因此，尽管矿洞环境很坏，他也赤身端着木油灯下去，跑遍了每条巷道、每个工作面。在洞里，他一边帮助工人装矿石，推篓子，一边了解情况，熟悉生产。这使他后来就能说服工人“减少私巷、加大主巷”〔注〕将巷道由一尺半高加大为三尺半高，改善了劳动环境，提高了生产效率。
            带头战胜困难
    他们这座矿是在半山腰上，三面环山，前面顺着矿洞口是条大水沟，每年在生产上都要遇到三大困难。严冬，矿山上积雪两尺来厚，而工人们要背着两百多斤重的矿石在陡坡上行走。雪给安全生产造成很大威胁。李斌总是天一明就亲自率领干部去工场扫雪铺路，扫完才吃饭，使工人们一开始生产就很方便。秋末冬初，山上水源枯竭，必须下山挑水。有一年天旱，工人们就翻山越岭去五里外挑水。路上有个很窄的陡坡，九百多步，稍不小心，就会连人带桶摔下岩去。他们一天的生产用水和生活用水需两千多担，挑水工人怎么也忙不过来。李斌也就亲自去挑水，带动了许多干部和工人都去挑水。盛夏暴雨，各山的水都往矿洞前面的大水沟流，随时都有淹没矿洞、停止生产的危险，李斌又日日夜夜在矿山上检查情况，以防山洪袭击。
    前年的一个夏夜，打雷，闪电，暴雨。从高山直泻下来的洪水，冲得全山哗哗响，冲得山坡滑溜难行。十一点多钟，李斌还同工会干部周介民打着雨伞，去各工场巡查。他们一走到一工场二号洞门口，就发现前面的水沟被矿渣堆堵住了，急涨的山水倒流回来，流进了矿洞，还差尺把高就要将洞门封死，而洞里还有三十多个工人在生产。眼看就要造成一场严重事故！他慌忙丢下雨伞，叫周介民守住洞口，自己跌跌扑扑跑到山上工人宿舍喊叫：“赶快起来，去排水！”一声吆喝，工人们都带着耙锄赶来了。他又一边叫人下洞去喊那三十多人，一边在暴雨中带头挖沟。半小时后，他们挖开了三条大沟，山水便急速消退。二号洞第二天仍然照常生产。
          怎样对待生活小事
    从1955年下半年起，他们的生产根本好转了。他们先后用奖励基金盖了四千三百多平方公尺的宿舍，省工会也在这里投资建了个工人俱乐部。工人反映：“在深山里建起了大街。”这样，工人生活该没问题了吧？但二工场的工人刚搬进新楼，就向他反映：“厕所不够，得想办法解决。”他想：“像厕所这样的小事，找我干什么！”没有注意。后来工人又找他，还拉他去看，他见一百五十多人住在一起，厕所只有两个蹲位，是少了，便将意见转给行政，但行政也没解决。第三次，工人就在职工代表会上提出批评：“你们每天早晨来解手试试看。”这才引起他的警惕，赶快催行政花了几十元，加盖了个厕所。工人见了他都欢欢喜喜地说：“还是提意见好，厕所解决了。”但是，有的工人不讲卫生，拉的厕所遍地屎尿。有一天，他又拉着团委书记说：“我们两人带带头，打扫厕所去。”团委书记扫地，他撒石灰。接着党委书记和经理也来动手了。他们几下就打扫得干干净净，还在门边搁上一把扫帚，写了个很俏皮的牌子：“瞄准射击，注意卫生。”这样，工人也自觉保持清洁了。
    李斌每天上午处理了日常事务后，总要去工人宿舍，探看一些生病的工人，帮助他们解决困难。有一次，拖磺工刘兴典病的盖了两床被窝，眼泪噙噙地躺在那里。李斌问道：“吃药没有？”刘兴典说：“没有水。”“为什么不去倒？”“走不动，也没有人。”李斌立刻去隔壁端来开水，扶他起来吃了药，又替他冲了碗糖水喝，再盖好被窝。一个多钟头后，李斌不放心。又来看他，见他烧的更厉害。便急忙找工场的工会主席，两人将他搀扶到住诊所去了。刘兴典事后提起这事还很激动：“这比家里照顾的还好。要不好好生产，就对不起人。”
    今年4月，全矿有一半以上的职工得了流行性感冒。医务人员忙不过来。李斌又将工会的干部和积极分子组织起来，亲自带头担任护理员，给病人端水送饭，招呼病人吃药，安置病人睡觉，忙了一个多月。
    在处理生活问题上，李斌并不是群众说什么，就给什么。今年第三季度，二工场有的工人认为生产好了，应该将1954年初盖的草房（一部分工人宿舍）改为瓦房。但全矿今年只剩下四千元奖励基金了，行政还准备用来将矿洞口上的生产用的茅棚改为瓦房。工人的要求与领导的意图有了矛盾。李斌便将这个问题交给职工代表会讨论。代表们争论的很热烈。有的说：“睡在草房里，半夜失火，水又少，很容易出事故。”有的说：“如果洞口前的茅棚失火，硫磺烟子一熏，洞里的人一个也出不来。更危险！”这样，大家都同意这部分工人宿舍暂时不改建，而将这笔钱用来改建洞口的生产厂房。工人们还由此进一步明确了生产与生活的关系，掀起了争取超额完成全年生产计划的热潮。
          教育和培养新的一代
    他们这座矿1953年才二百多人，到1955年下半年就发展到一千人，新工人很多。这些工人大都是附近乡里来的，他们当时有句很流行的话：“忙时在家种田，闲时上山挣点油盐钱。不为几个钱，我来矿里干啥？”当他们成为固定工人后，也还抱着这种态度。如何向这些新工人进行社会主义和共产主义教育，便成了工会的重大任务。
    李斌除了一般地宣传教育外，很注意在这些新工人中扎根串连，培养积极分子。
    他亲自培养的淘矿工彭立荣，这个青工是贫农出身，很忠厚。但他当时最大的缺点是：开会不到，吃了饭就睡觉，生产不落后也不上前。李斌在工场里向他讲：“老彭，下班后，我们仔细谈谈。”他“嗯”了一声，就不讲了。但当李斌去宿舍找他时，咳，他却躺在床上说：“我今天搞累了，要睡觉。”他就这样拒绝了李斌不下十来次。
    不过，李斌已从旁打听清楚：他家人口多，生活困难。他父亲嘱咐他：“到矿上多拿点钱回来养家。”他的叔父彭仪卿是矿上的老工人，旧时做工压断了腿，被资本家赶走，弄得一家人无法生活，妻子跟人去了，自己讨米要饭。直到解放后，人民政府才帮助他把妻子接回来，全家团聚。
    因此，李斌仍然一有机会就找他扯谈，问他多大年纪，家里多少人，生活怎样。他总是问一句答一句。问他这座矿山是哪个的，他也答：“不晓得，做工拿钱就行了。”两人逐渐混熟了。李斌就问他：“你父亲有几弟兄？”他说：“两三个。”“叔父在哪里？”“矿上那个跛了腿的，就是我叔父。”“怎么跛的？”“资本家压断的。”“怎么不医？”“他饭都没吃的，还医！”“你们为啥不给他医？”“我们也自身难保，没钱给他医。”“唉，像现在就好了。”“现在还有啥说的？政府多好！”李斌看他有觉悟，便给他讲解两个社会制度和共产党，进行正面教育。后来，彭立荣找他帮助填写加入工会的表，他也不放过机会：“这么漂亮的小伙子，还不会写字？”“没读过书嘛！”“过去怎么不读书？”“我父亲吃的都没有，还有钱供我上学？”不断地诱导他回忆过去，对比现在，启发他的阶级觉悟。
    渐渐地，二十来岁的彭立荣在工作、学习等各方面都积极起来了。工人选他当工会小组长，他对收会费、叫人开会，都做的挺好。这时，李斌帮助他总结自己淘矿的操作经验，使产量由每人每天一千四百斤提高到两千斤。李斌又帮助他去总结高光忠等人的操作经验，使一个筛子的使用效率由淘洗四万二千斤矿石延长到七万斤。教给他各种工作方法。他后来还被评选为丙等劳模，到县里去开会。
    去年肃反，彭立荣和三个工人脱产去各大城市跑了几个月。那三人回矿后表示：“宁肯少拿几个工资，也要脱产当干部。”但是，彭立荣刚回来，李斌就教育他，要他回小组生产，他二话没讲，第二天就去淘矿，把手都磨起了泡，也仍然坚持下来。今年流行性感冒袭击矿山，很多干部病倒了，他又脱产搞了一个多月的工场领导工作。但当生产秩序恢复正常后，他又回小组生产去了。
    经过李斌长期的帮助和教育，彭立荣现时已成了一工场的党支部副书记兼工会劳动保险委员，但他仍然不脱产，生产和政治工作都搞的挺好。他还培养了陈良珍、易绍林等许多积极分子。陈良珍还被工人选为生产组长，并入了党。
    经过这样将近四年的努力，李斌已经做到：全矿一千零六十名工人，他能讲出八百多人的姓名、家庭情况和劳动情况。他的工作经验引起了湖北全省工会干部的兴趣。他被选为出席中国工会第八次代表大会的代表。
    〔注〕这个矿从前是一个人就开一个巷道，他们把这种巷道叫做“私巷”。私巷都只有一尺半高，人很难行动，但要都加大为三尺半高，力量来不及。故需要将“私巷”减少，集中力量加大主要巷道，以改善劳动环境。
