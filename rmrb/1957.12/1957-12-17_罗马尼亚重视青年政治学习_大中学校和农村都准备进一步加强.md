Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, December 16th -- The Romanian newspaper "Spark of Youth" recently reported that Romanian youth's political studies have greatly improved this year compared to last year. The number of youth political study groups has increased by 30% compared to last year, and the number of participants has doubled. A large number of political study groups have also been organized in universities and colleges this year.

The "Spark of Youth" pointed out that youth political study groups play a significant role in raising the political thinking of young people and mobilizing them to build a new socialist life. The newspaper believes that this achievement is the result of the Romanian Workers' Party and the Labor Youth League attaching importance to youth political studies.

The newspaper then criticized the Labor Youth League in some states for not paying enough attention to this work, and the political studies of some rural youth have not yet been organized. It requested that the Labor Youth League organizations in various regions conscientiously study the situation of youth political studies, and send the best cadres to these rural areas to organize youth political studies. It also called on the administrative units and Labor Youth League organizations in universities and colleges to strengthen their leadership over youth political studies.

    罗马尼亚重视青年政治学习
    大中学校和农村都准备进一步加强
    新华社布加勒斯特16日电　罗马尼亚“青年火花报”最近报道说，今年罗马尼亚青年的政治学习比去年有了很大改进。青年政治学习小组的数量比去年增加了30％，参加的人数增加了一倍。在大、中学校里今年也组织了一大批政治学习小组。
    “青年火花报”指出，青年政治学习小组对提高青年的政治思想和发动青年进行建设社会主义新生活的工作有很大作用。报纸认为，这一成就是罗马尼亚工人党和劳动青年联盟重视青年政治学习的结果。
    这家报纸接着批评某些州的劳动青年联盟对这一工作还不够关心，一些农村青年的政治学习还没有组织起来。它要求各地劳动青年联盟组织认真地研究青年政治学习的情况，并且派遣最好的干部到这些农村把青年的政治学习组织起来。它还要求大中学的行政单位和劳动青年联盟组织加强对青年政治学习的领导。
