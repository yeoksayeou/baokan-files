　　Home · The Sound of the Qin
　　—Sketches from the Borderland
    Gu Gong

　　Home

　　The engineer very stingily took out some moldy tobacco scraps, rolled them into a small paper tube, and smoked them with relish. But after smoking half of it, he put out the cigarette, saying with cherishment:

　　"Let's save some! Otherwise, we'll 'run out of food' tomorrow!"

　　I sat next to him, giving him a helpless bitter smile.

　　However, the engineer didn't seem very satisfied with my bitter smile. He began to nag:

　　"It's really tough here! But I really don't want to leave here. There's always something indescribable that makes you reluctant to leave. At first, when I first arrived in the army, I heard the soldiers say, and the cadres say: 'Come to our home to play tomorrow, we're having a party!' 'Our family's living conditions have improved a lot.' 'Hey! I've been away from home for two days for a meeting, and I really miss it!'… When I first heard these words, I was always confused, always thinking that the 'home' they were talking about was either Henan or Shanxi, either by the Pearl River or at the foot of Changbai Mountain… No, it turns out that the home they were talking about refers to the Kangzang under their feet, referring to the company they are in, the unit they are in… Why does everyone talk like this? This matter always puzzled me… Well, guess what, as time went by, my feelings changed unconsciously, and now when I open my mouth, I'm also like this! 'Come sit at my house?' 'Go home quickly!'… Everyone understands what this 'home' means: it refers to Kangzang, referring to the troops I am in…"

　　The engineer got excited and lit the half-smoked cigarette again, taking a deep breath full of happiness and warmth!

　　"In my life, I have traveled to many places and experienced many things, but I think if someone were to ask me: 'What was the most difficult and challenging period in your life?' Then I would answer without hesitation: 'It is today'; but if that person were to ask me again: 'What was the happiest and most proud period in your life?' Then I would answer even more quickly: 'It is also today!'…"

　　The Sound of the Qin

　　A soldier sat on a tree stump, playing the huqin. The sound of the huqin was like a babbling spring, the sound of the huqin was like an eagle spreading its wings and circling, the sound of the huqin was like this newly built road, winding down from this mountain peak and then winding up to that mountain peak….

　　The Tibetan laborers, who had just packed up their picks, hoes, and food utensils and were preparing to go home, gathered around in twos and threes, in groups of four and five. The soldier was playing their hometown folk song! They couldn't help but hold hands and sway gently, their bare feet couldn't help but tap to the rhythm, and their mouths couldn't help but sing softly:

　　After crossing dozens of snow-capped mountains!
　　We can still see the smoke from the roof of our house.
　　After wading through hundreds of rivers!
　　We can still hear the calls of our parents.
　　I have drunk many, many river waters,
　　Only the water of the Yarlung Zangbo River is the sweetest.
　　I have seen many, many flowers,
　　Only the flowers of our hometown are the most beautiful.

　　The soldier's tune became more and more rapid, and the laborers' dance steps became faster and faster…. When the tune was finished, everyone laughed "boisterously" in mutual admiration, and several female laborers lifted their colorful outer skirts to cover their blushing faces.

　　A laborer, still with a bit of childishness, suddenly pounced on the soldier's knee and said:

　　"Come back to our hometown with me!"

　　Immediately, many laborers leaned closer:

　　"If you don't go to our hometown, everyone in our village will miss you so much that they'll get sick!"

　　"You play the qin so well that you can make the whole village dance…"

　　"We will always remember the sound of your qin, remembering every word you said when you were building the road with us."

　　"Let's go! Let's go! Let's go to our hometown!"

　　The soldier plucked the strings of the qin and smiled helplessly:

　　"No, my fellow villagers, you have so many hometowns, which hometown should I go to? But as long as you live in Kangzang, you will always hear the sound of our qin…"

　　As he spoke, the soldier began to play the huqin again, the sound of the qin warming this land, the sound of the qin warming the heart of every Tibetan people….

　　家·琴声
　　——写在边疆的散记
    顾工
　　家
    工程师非常吝啬地掏出一些发霉的烟末，卷成一个小纸筒，津津有味地吸着。但吸了一半他又把烟掐灭了，珍惜地说：
    “就留下点儿吧！不然明天就要‘断粮’了！”
    我坐在他的旁边，替他作了一个无可奈何的苦笑。
    不过，看样子工程师对我这个苦笑，并不十分满意。他开始唠叨了：
    “这儿是真苦啊！可是我还真不愿意离开这儿，这儿总有点儿说不上来的叫你舍不得离开的地方。起初，我刚到部队的时候，听战士们说，听干部们说：‘明天到我们家玩玩去，我们举行晚会！’‘我们家的生活条件改善多了’‘咳！离家出来开了两天会，真想的慌！……’我乍听这些话，总搞不清，总以为他们说的‘家’?！不是河南，就是山西，不是珠江边上，就是长白山下……不，原来他们所说的家，就是指他们脚底下站着的康藏，指他们所在的连队、所在的单位……怎么都这么说话呢？这事儿总叫我纳闷……。好，你猜怎么着，日子长了，不知不觉我的感情也起了变化了，现在我一张口，也是这样啦！‘上我家坐坐？’‘快回家去吧！’……这个‘家’谁都明白：就是指康藏，指我所在的部队……”
    工程师一兴奋，又把那掐灭的半截烟头点着了，充满幸福，充满温暖地深深吸了一口！
    “我这一生，跑过好多地方，经过好多事，可是我想假使有一个人来问我：你这一生中最艰苦最困难的是哪段日子？’那么我会不加思索地回答：‘是今天’；但是那个人假使再问我一句：‘你这一生中最快乐最值得自豪的是哪段日子？’那么我会更快地回答：‘也是今天！’…… ”
    琴声
    一个战士坐在一根树桩上，在拉着胡琴。那琴声像泉水潺潺流动，那琴声像苍鹰展翅回旋，那琴声像是这段刚刚修好的公路，从这个山巅上绕下来，又向那个山巅盘上去……。
    正收拾好镐、锄，收拾好食具准备回家的藏族民工，都三三俩俩地，四五成群地围上来，这位战士拉的正是他们家乡的民歌啊！他们不由得手牵着手，轻轻地摆起来，他们赤着的脚，也不由得轻轻地踏着节奏，他们的嘴也不由得轻轻地唱起来：
    翻过了几十座雪山啊！
    还看得见自己屋顶的炊烟
    淌过了几百道河流啊！
    还听得见父母双亲的呼唤
    我喝过许多许多的河水
    只有雅鲁藏布江的水最甜
    我见过许多许多鲜花
    只有我们家乡的花朵最艳
    战士的曲子越拉越急促了，民工们的舞步也越跳越快速了……。当这个曲子拉完的时候，大家都相互赞赏地“哄哄”地笑起来，有几个女民工，撩起彩色的外裙，遮住了自己的发红的脸。
    一个还带着几分孩子气的民工，突然扑到战士的膝上说：
    “你跟着我回到我们的家乡吧！”
    立时，许多民工都更加靠拢来：
    “你不去我们的家乡，我们全乡人都会想出病来的！”
    “你的琴拉得太好了，能够拉得整个村庄都跳起来……”
    “我们永远想着你的琴声，想着你和我们在一起修路时说过的每句话。”
    “走吧！走吧！去我们的家乡吧！”
    战士拨了拨琴弦，无可奈何地笑了：
    “不行啊！我的乡亲们，你们有这么多的家乡，我去哪个家乡才好呢？可是只要你们生长在康藏，你们就永远会听到我们的琴声……”
    说着，战士又拉起了胡琴，琴声温暖着这片土地，琴声温暖着每一颗藏族人民的心……。
