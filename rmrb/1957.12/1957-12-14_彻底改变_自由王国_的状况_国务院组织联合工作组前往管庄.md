Xinhua News Agency, Guanzhuang, December 13th. In order to thoroughly resolve some fundamental problems existing in units affiliated with central state organs residing in Guanzhuang, the State Council dispatched a five-person work team to Guanzhuang on the 11th.

This work team is composed of personnel from five units: the State Council, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Tong County Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Hebei Province, the Ministry of Public Security, and the Ministry of Building Materials Industry. Their arrival in Guanzhuang will coordinate with the third stage of the rectification movement in Guanzhuang. On the basis of the original achievements in general rectification, they will further mobilize the masses to focus on rectifying a batch of problems that must be solved and can be solved currently, such as social security, unified administrative management, and material supply.

At 3:00 PM on the 11th, the news of the arrival of the five-person work team in Guanzhuang spread throughout Guanzhuang like a spring breeze. The masses were in high spirits and extremely joyful. Big-character posters expressing warm welcome to the work team appeared on the walls of various units. One big-character poster, jointly written by more than fifty people and titled "Hail the Arrival of the State Council Work Team, United from Top to Bottom, Resolutely Eliminate the 'Independent Kingdom' of Guanzhuang," stated, "The arrival of the work team makes us deeply realize how the Party and the government care about the lives and demands of the people, and how resolutely and thoroughly the Party is improving its work with a revolutionary spirit. We are determined to respond to the call of the Party and resolutely wage a resolute struggle against bureaucratism and departmentalism." A big-character poster jointly written by sixty-four people said: "We sincerely hope to unify the leadership of the 'independent kingdom' – Guanzhuang – and eradicate the departmentalism that has existed in Guanzhuang for many years." Another big-character poster said: "We will use a hundredfold confidence to correct our work attitude and carry out rectification with the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, and resolutely and thoroughly change this 'independent kingdom' situation."

The Guanzhuang Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has been further strengthened in its confidence in rectification by the arrival of the work team. Party Secretary Su Jiguang said that we must make every effort to solve the problems of Guanzhuang with the help of the work team, which will deepen the rectification work by one step.

The five-person work team is currently holding various symposiums to gain an in-depth understanding of the situation and prepare to assist in solving some problems.

(Editor's note: Guanzhuang is located between Beijing and Tong County, Hebei. Due to the bureaucratism and departmentalism of the leaders of the organs stationed here, Guanzhuang has long been in a chaotic state of being unmanaged. See this newspaper's article "Independent Kingdom – Guanzhuang" on November 30th for details.)

　　彻底改变“自由王国”的状况
    国务院组织联合工作组前往管庄
    新华社管庄13日电　国务院为了彻底解决住在管庄内的中央国家机关所属单位存在的一些带根本性的问题，在11日派了一个五人工作组到管庄去。
    这个工作组是由国务院、中共北京市委员会、中共河北省通县地方委员会、公安部和建筑材料工业部五个单位的人员组成的。他们到管庄去将配合管庄第三阶段的整风运动，在原有的一般整改成绩的基础上，进一步发动群众，集中地整改当前必须解决而又可以解决的一批问题，比如社会治安、行政统一管理、物资供应等问题。
    11日下午三时，五人工作组到达管庄的消息像春风一样传遍了全管庄，群情振奋，欣喜万分，对工作组表示热烈欢迎的大字报，纷纷出现在各单位的墙上。有一张五十多人联名写的题为：“欢呼国务院工作组的到来，上下一心，坚决消灭管庄的‘自由王国’”的大字报说，“工作组的来临，使我们深刻体会到党和政府是如何关怀着人民的生活和要求，党是如何坚决彻底以革命的精神来改进工作。我们决心响应党的号召，坚决的向官僚主义和本位主义进行坚决的斗争”。一张六十四人联名写的大字报说：“我们衷心地希望能把‘自由王国’——管庄统一领导起来，把管庄多年来的本位主义连根拔掉”。还有一张大字报说：“我们将以百倍的信心来端正工作态度，并以批评和自我批评的精神来进行整改，坚决的彻底的改变这种‘自由王国’的局面”。
    中共管庄党委对于工作组的来临更加增强了整改的信心，党委书记苏继光说，我们要尽一切努力在工作组的帮助下解决管庄的问题，这将使整改工作深入一步。
    五人工作组这两天正在召开各种座谈会，深入了解情况，准备协助解决一些问题。
    （编者按：管庄位于北京和河北通县之间。由于驻在这里的机关领导上的官僚主义和本位主义，管庄长期处于无人管理的混乱状态。详见本报11月30日“自由王国——管庄”一文。）
