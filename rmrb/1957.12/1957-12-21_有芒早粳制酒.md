    Using Awned Early Indica Rice to Make Wine
    The nationally renowned Shaoxing Distillery in Zhejiang, with the assistance of the Shaoxing County Grain Bureau, has recently successfully trial-produced yellow wine and white spirit using awned early indica rice. Every 100 jin of rice can produce 73 jin and 15 liang of white spirit, which is nearly 9 jin more wine per 100 jin compared to using early rice. The steaming time is shortened by more than one hour. The cost of the wine is also reduced by 4%. (Wang Rongtang)

    有芒早粳制酒
    闻名全国的浙江绍兴酒厂，最近在绍兴县粮食局的帮助下，用有芒早粳试制黄酒、白酒成功。每百斤稻谷可出白酒七十三斤十五两，比用早稻制酒每百斤多出酒将近九斤。蒸制时间缩短一小时多。酒的成本也降低4％。（王荣堂）
