　　To Do a Good Job of Work Regarding the Families of Transferred Cadres
　　Editor:
　　Recently, it has been discovered that many family members are holding back transferred cadres, disagreeing with cadres participating in physical labor. A comrade named Jin in my department has already signed up to participate in physical labor as a worker and has written big-character posters expressing his determination. However, after discussing it with his wife at home, because his wife disagreed, Comrade Jin's determination wavered. There are also some family members who, upon hearing that their husbands and children are going to the countryside for production, make a lot of noise and commotion.
　　The lack of understanding among family members has a great impact on the progress of the work of transferring cadres. Therefore, I believe that we should quickly conduct ideological education for family members at present, so that they can recognize the great significance of cadres participating in physical labor. The specific methods are: First, the organization should dispatch some people to hold family member symposiums separately to understand the ideological situation of family members and conduct education and persuasion; second, resident organizations, especially women's organizations, should play a role and regard the work of educating family members as the current focus of work; third, proper arrangements should be made for the family members of transferred cadres; fourth, the cadres themselves should mobilize their family members.

### 要作好下放干部的家属工作

　　要作好下放干部的家属工作编辑同志：
    最近发现有许多家属拉下放干部的后腿，不同意干部参加体力劳动。我部有一个姓金的同志已报名参加体力劳动当工人，并且自己写了大字报表示决心。但回家后与爱人一商量，因为爱人不同意，金同志的决心就动摇了。也还有一些家属听说自己的丈夫、子女要下乡生产，就大吵大闹。
    家属思想不通，对干部下放工作的开展有很大影响，因此，我认为在目前应该赶紧对家属进行思想教育，使他们认识到干部参加体力劳动的重大意义。具体办法是：第一，由机关抽出些人分头召开家属座谈会，了解家属们的思想情况进行教育说服；第二，居民组织特别是妇女组织应发挥作用，把教育家属的工作当作目前的工作重点；第三，要对下放干部的家属进行妥善安排；第四，由干部本人向家属进行动员。
