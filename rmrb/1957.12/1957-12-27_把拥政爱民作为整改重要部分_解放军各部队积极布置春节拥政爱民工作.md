    Taking Supporting the Government and Cherishing the People as an Important Part of Rectification
    PLA Units Actively Deploy Spring Festival Work of Supporting the Government and Cherishing the People
    Xinhua News Agency, 26th. The various units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are actively deploying work to support the government and cherish the people during the 1958 Spring Festival.
    The General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army recently issued a notice on the work of supporting the government and cherishing the people during the 1958 Spring Festival, requiring the entire army to regard the work of supporting the government and cherishing the people during the 1958 Spring Festival as an important part of the current rectification stage. The Party committees and political organs of units at or above the regiment level must, based on the problems in the relationship between the army and local Party and government organs and the relationship between the army and the people revealed during the rectification, combined with the opinions solicited by the army from local Party and government organs and the people since 1957, summarize the situation of the relationship between the army and local Party and government organs and the relationship between the army and the people in 1957. On the one hand, conduct education on supporting the government and cherishing the people to the troops; on the other hand, explain the measures taken by the troops to solve the relationship between the army and the people to the local Party and government organs and the people, and seek to further strengthen the unity between the army and local Party and government organs and between the army and the people under the leadership of the local Party and government organs and the supervision of the people.
    The notice also requires units at or above the regiment level to make specific plans for supporting the government and cherishing the people and supporting production (especially agricultural production) in 1958 according to the tasks of the troops and the specific conditions of the駐地, and actively organize the implementation of所属 troops after being reviewed by the local Party committee, in order to greet the great leap forward in agricultural production in 1958 with practical actions.
    The military units stationed in Nanjing, Shenyang, Wuhan, Guangzhou and other places, and the political department of the Air Force, have recently made specific plans in accordance with the notice of the General Political Department. The Guangzhou area garrison plans to use four million workdays to support agricultural production in 1958. The leading organs of the Nanjing garrison require the political organs above the regiment level to send working groups during the Spring Festival to solicit opinions from the masses and local Party and government organs on the implementation of mass discipline, policies and laws by the troops, and resolutely correct any shortcomings found. The leading organs of the Nanjing garrison also called on the troops to actively support the current winter and spring agricultural production campaign and the patriotic health campaign. The political departments of the military units stationed in Shenyang, Wuhan and other places proposed to further inspect the military occupation of land during the Spring Festival, resolutely return the surplus land to the masses before the spring plowing, and strive not to delay spring plowing and sowing. The Air Force and other units proposed that before the Spring Festival, combined with the socialist education and discipline rectification work of the troops, a widespread and in-depth ideological education on supporting the government and cherishing the people should be carried out in the troops, and all thoughts and behaviors that are not conducive to the unity between the army and the people should be analyzed and criticized, and corresponding improvement measures should be formulated. Problems that violate mass discipline and affect the unity between the army and the people should be jointly studied and handled item by item with the local Party and government organs. The leading organs of the Air Force also called on the troops to practice thrift, live a simple life, and buy as few New Year goods as possible during the New Year and Spring Festival, so as not to cause market supply tensions.

    把拥政爱民作为整改重要部分
    解放军各部队积极布置春节拥政爱民工作
    新华社26日讯　中国人民解放军各部队积极布置1958年春节期间的拥政爱民工作。
    人民解放军总政治部已在最近发出1958年春节期间拥政爱民工作的通知，要求全军把1958年春节期间拥政爱民工作当作目前整改阶段的一个重要部分。团以上单位的党委和政治机关必须根据整改中揭露的军队和地方党政机关关系、军民关系方面的问题，结合1957年以来部队征求地方党政机关和人民群众的意见，将1957年军队和地方党政机关关系、军民关系的情况做出总结。一方面向部队进行拥政爱民教育；另方面把部队解决军民关系的措施向地方党政机关和人民群众作出交代，求得在当地党政机关领导和人民群众的监督下，进一步增强军队和地方党政机关、军民之间的团结。
    通知中还要求团以上单位按照部队的任务和驻地的具体情况，做出1958年拥政爱民和支援生产（特别是农业生产）的具体规划，经过当地地方党委审核后，积极组织所属部队实施，以实际行动迎接1958年农业生产的大跃进。
    南京、沈阳、武汉、广州等地驻军和空军政治部，都在最近按照总政治部的通知做出了具体的规划。广州地区驻军计划在1958年用四百万个劳动日支援农业生产。南京驻军领导机关要求团以上政治机关在春节期间派出工作组，向驻地群众和地方党政机关征求对部队执行群众纪律与政策法令情况的意见，发现缺点坚决改正。南京驻军领导机关还号召部队积极支援各地今冬明春的农业大生产运动和爱国卫生运动。沈阳、武汉等地驻军政治部提出要在春节期间进一步检查军事占用土地的情况，坚决把多余土地在春耕以前退回给群众，争取不误春耕播种。空军等单位提出春节前结合部队社会主义教育和整顿纪律工作，在部队中普遍进行一次广泛深入的拥政爱民的思想教育，对一切不利于军民团结的思想、行为，进行分析批判，订出相应的改进措施。凡违犯群众纪律、影响军民团结的问题，应与地方党政机关共同研究逐件逐条加以处理。空军领导机关还号召部队在新年春节期间要厉行节约，简朴过年，尽量少买年货，以免造成市场供应紧张情况。
