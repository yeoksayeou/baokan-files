Seeing American Society's Morbid State Through the Corruption and Degeneration of American College Students
"The American Courier" Magazine Publishes a College Student's Letter
Editor's Note: "The American Courier" magazine published a long letter from a senior college student in its November issue under the "University Forum" column. In this letter, the author exposes the corruption and degeneration of American college students and points out that this is a microcosm of American society's morbid state. The full text of the original letter is translated below:

Sir: Today's college student is merely a mirror of his culture. The student's social status, etiquette, taboos, conformity, speech, and interests are primarily the products of the interaction between the student and his environment; in this sense, his intellectual state is similar to that of any category of American.

The intellectual games of college students, their often foolish pranks such as stealing female students' underwear, their lack of individuality, and their conformity are completely the same as those of any other category of people.

The initiation rites and free discussions of college fraternities may be boring, but they are no more boring than the novels we read in weekly popular magazines, the content of gossip columns in our newspapers, or the conversations we have while playing cards with ladies. All the stupid actions common on American college campuses can be found in the cultural patterns of the American people.

There seems to be great indifference to politics on campus. University people are simply not interested in current world affairs. The reason is obvious. Today, America maintains itself in a state of constant readiness that can be called "New New Deal." Our economy is not the government-sponsored "slow socialism" of the 1930s; our economy is now balanced and maintained by spending tens of billions of dollars on defense—a method that keeps our manufacturers, our neighbors, our labor force, and industries tense, busy, and prosperous. Thus, students, and adults like them, optimistically accept this situation because they know they are powerless in this regard. This attitude of college students is mistaken by many as political indifference.

Many college students today know almost nothing about literature. What they write is incoherent, and they are unwilling and unable to discuss any form of art other than nude paintings. They disdain the immortal masterpieces in their magnificent university libraries, and greedily read the low-grade publications and obscene magazines that fill the newsstands, resulting in bloated minds and empty stomachs. Throughout the United States, like a swarm of black ants crowding onto a piece of rotten candy, millions flock to local newsstands to greedily read every issue of their favorite scandal magazines. These people devour these things in one breath, taking pride in the vile and malicious insinuations that appear in the guise of exposing someone's private life. After swallowing and digesting these magazines, their greedy, hungry eyes turn to the latest popular novels... the latest, most vulgar, and most obscene books, whose authors have limited talent and write entirely for profit by using the stimulation and limited satisfaction that American readers get from life to make money.

Many college students amuse themselves with boring things like beer parties, campus elections, and beauty pageant competitions, which are both low-grade and a waste of time. But American housewives also put aside housework and turn on the TV in the afternoon for entertainment, enjoying countless advertising farces, where some poor, miserable people appear in front of everyone, competing with each other for prizes and money. These poor, unthinking people are very much like the rats dissected in biological laboratories for everyone to study, using their own problems to entertain the vast audience of mothers.

I am saying that American college students are merely products of their culture. Their habits are no more ridiculous than those of the entire American public. If he is a complete, unchangeable, and thorough conformist, it is only because his culture worships conformity; in the final analysis, college students learn their values from the entire culture rather than from the university itself.

If a college student is afraid of debate, it is only because he has been consciously and unconsciously taught that in America, personal ideals and permanent human values are less important than the ability to get along, and "getting along" means expressing opinions after seeing the "situation." The stupid cliché "If you don't have something brilliant to say, don't say anything at all" has poisoned his mind since he was able to speak.

The authors of books on cultivating personality and the promoters of cheap ideas about success have convinced him that in America, those who get along and are "successful" in the common sense are those who don't offend anyone and please everyone. They preach that you must never be unconventional, never appear special, and especially must be popular; they also preach that you must never, ever discuss religion or politics, and that it is useless to express opinions unless they are in agreement or affirmative; they also say that those who disagree with teachers, or fraternities, or bosses are monsters, unrestrained people, radicals, or are subjected to dirty, nasty, vulgar abuse, which is only one of the many abuses that people who dare to disagree slightly sometimes encounter.

College students, like the general American public, are prisoners in the prisons they themselves have built. His seeking of his companions' approval at any cost is the lock, bars, and high walls of his prison. His fear of expressing different freedom locks him in tightly. Any bit of enterprising spirit, any bit of talent, any bit of passion must conform to the purpose of seeking others' approval. ...

American college students today are very ignorant of any form of art, indifferent to politics, have mediocre tastes, and are bored in conversation. They are generally unconcerned about wasting their time and indulging in absurd American pastimes such as baseball batting averages, pitcher scores, and pornographic books and pictures. College students are fully committed to the meaningless pursuit of "'our' happiness," but this pursuit was first carried out, encouraged, implemented, and promoted by their elders—the American public.

However, given the prevalence of beer parties, Easter parades, debates over pitcher scores, and metal monsters (referring to large sedans - translator) that consume a lot of fuel and cannot even fit in garages, it is fair to ask: What is the reason our society is so sick in so many ways? Despite our nation's rich natural resources, vigorous, strong, and industrious people, and the government system designed for such a complex and vast country and people that is probably the best, most practical, and successful, we still seem to be seriously ill, a serious illness that hinders the growth of American culture as a whole, limits us, and allows us to make only a small amount of valuable cultural contributions in painting, sculpture, literature, and philosophy in this ocean of talent and material wealth. The central idea of the morbidity that permeates all aspects of American life, the philosophy that best describes the American people, is "profiteering."

Why do American parents want to make their children conformists, people who seek only economic security? Why do American parents generally no longer proudly say, "This child certainly has his own ideas," but instead say "This child really knows the value of a dollar"? This is because Americans, the general, vast American public, do not truly "know" the value of a dollar. They value money too much. For money, they sacrifice everything and teach their sons to sacrifice everything.

It seems that a fundamental central idea of our cultural value system today, our universal, all-encompassing purpose as a people and a nation, is the pursuit of material goals. Of course, it is unobjectionable for a part of a system to sell labor and products to customers at fixed prices in order to make a certain degree of profit. However, when this profit-making purpose goes awry, when the concept of "profit" begins to develop like a cancerous malignancy, shrouding all other aspects of the system in its vast, dark, and morbid shadow, when the system goes so awry that "capitalism" only means "profit" and "profiteering" becomes the most important lesson taught to young people—then, the inherent competition of our system goes beyond being an economic way of life and becomes a social, emotional, spiritual, moral, and psychological way of life... becomes an ethic. Thus, competition becomes a dangerous, festering toxin that infects the entire culture... Thus, merchants promote their products through television programs, relying on competitions of human misfortune... Thus, famous pastors say that the pure religious peace of mind they preach can and must be sold like soap of pure quality - by relying on acting, dancers, singers, and the noisy and tiresome advertising gimmicks that seem to characterize all commercial ventures today.

Obviously, today's semi-capitalist economy in America is seen by too many people too often as merely a profit-making economy. ...

"Physically fit" America, with its mass-producing brains and collectivized blood, looks very healthy on the outside, but suffers from acromegaly... its arms are too long, its outstretched hands for grabbing and seizing are too big, too greedy, its brains are too small, and they are all the same. When this "monster" seeks pleasure in the dark, it uses money, "profiteering," as a beacon. The firefly-like light of this lamp is so dim, so weak, so unreal, so tiny, and the light it casts on the narrow, trampled road is so incomplete that the monster, in its tumbling pursuit to reach this goal, is willing to give up the right to express, and even to hold independent ideals, if these ideals conflict with the boss, the public, the company... "those who give money." This monster does not know why the generation it nurtures is so silent. This is because—as is the case with most children—they learn from their fathers, who have no time to speak, talk, or express ideas, because besides sleeping, he is drunkenly tumbling in pursuit of the vague, distant, but attractive goal of greater material happiness.

　　从美国大学生腐化堕落看美国社会病态
　　“美国信使”杂志刊载一个大学生的来信
    编者按“美国信使”杂志11月号“大学论坛”栏下刊载了一个大学四年级学生的一封长信。作者在这封信中揭露了美国大学生的腐化堕落，并且指出这是美国社会病态的缩影。现将原信全文译载如下：
    先生：今天的大学学生只不过是他的文化的一面镜子。学生的社会地位、礼仪举止、禁忌戒律、从俗随流、言论和兴趣主要是学生和他的环境相互影响的产物；在这个意义上说来，他的智力状况和任何类别的美国人是相似的。
    大学生的智力游戏，他们抢女同学三角裤这种常常是愚蠢的取闹，他们的缺乏个性和他们的从俗随流是同任何其他类别的人完全一样的。
    大学生联谊会的入会礼和自由讨论可能是无聊的，但是并不比我们在每周出版的通俗杂志上读到的小说、比我们报上的闲谈栏里的内容、比同女士们玩牌时候的谈话更无聊。美国各大学校园里共有的一切愚蠢的举动都在美国人民的文化形态中找得到相同的东西。
    校园里对于政治似乎是十分冷淡的。大学人士对于目前的世界大事干脆就是不感兴趣。理由是明显的。今天美国使自己保持一种可以称作“新新政”的经常准备状态。我们的经济不是1930年代的政府赞助的“缓慢的社会主义”，我们的经济现在是靠花费几百亿防御费用的办法而得以保持平衡并维持下来——这种办法使得我们的制造商、我们的邻居、我们的劳动大军和工业都很紧张忙碌，愉快繁荣。于是学生们、以及跟他们相像的成年人，都达观地接受这种情况，因为他们知道在这方面他们是无能为力的。大学生的这种态度被许多人误认为政治上的冷淡。
    许多大学生今天对于文学差不多一无所知。他们写的东西文理不通，除了裸体画以外，不愿意也不能够讨论任何形式的艺术。对于他们的堂皇的大学图书馆里的不朽杰作，他们不屑一顾，而贪读充斥书摊的低级书刊和猥亵杂志，结果是脑满肠肥、腹内空虚。在美国各地，像一群黑蚂蚁拥到一块烂糖上去一样，千百万人蜂涌到当地书摊上贪婪地阅读每一期他们喜欢的揭人丑闻的杂志。这些人如饥如渴地一口气读完这些东西，对于以揭露某些人私生活的面貌出现的卑鄙恶毒的含沙射影的东西反以为荣。在把这些杂志囫囵吞枣融会贯通以后，贪婪、饥渴的眼睛又转到了最新出版的流行小说……最新的、最下流的、最猥亵的书上一饱眼福，这些书的作者才华有限，进行写作完全是为了用使美国读者在生活中得到发泄的刺激和有限的满足这种办法来牟利赚钱。
    许多大学生搞啤酒会、校园选举和美女选拔比赛这样的无聊事情来取乐，这种娱乐既低级又浪费时间。但是美国家庭妇女也放下家务不理，在下午扭开电视机消遣，欣赏不胜枚举的广告闹剧，在大家面前出现的是一些可怜的苦命人，为了奖品和钱互相比赛彼此的苦命。这些可怜的、没有思想的人非常像生物实验室里剖腹开膛、让大家研究的老鼠，以他们自己的切身问题来供广大的听众妈妈们消遣。
    我是说美国的大学学生仅仅是他的文化的产物。他的一套习惯并不比全体美国公众的习惯更荒唐可笑。如果他是一个完全的、不可更改的、彻底的从俗随流的人的话，那仅仅是因为他的文化崇尚从俗随流；归根结底，大学生与其说是从大学本身，不如说是整个文化学到他的价值标准的。
    如果一个大学生害怕辩论，那只是因为他被有意识地和无意识地教导说，在美国，个人的理想和永久的人的价值不如处世的能力重要，而“处世”就是说在看清“形势”以后再表示意见。“如果没有精彩的话要说就干脆什么也不要说”的愚蠢滥调，从一个人能说话的时候起就毒害着他的思想。
    陶冶个性书籍的作者、成功之道的廉价思想的宣扬者使他相信，在美国吃得开，在通行的意义上“成功”的人是那些不得罪任何人，讨好一切人的人。他们宣扬说，决不要标新立异，决不要显得特殊，尤其是必须人缘好；又宣扬说，决不要，千万不要讨论宗教或政治，表示意见没有用，除非是表示同意或肯定的意见；又说，同教师，或联谊会，或老板意见不合的人是怪物、是不受拘束的人，是激进分子，或者是遭到肮脏的、难听不堪的、下流的无聊的辱骂，这种辱骂只是有时胆敢略有不同意见的人会遭到的许许多多辱骂之一而已。
    大学生像一般美国人民一样，都是他自己建造的监狱里的囚犯，他不惜任何代价寻求他的同伴的赞同就是他的监狱的门锁、铁栅和高墙。他害怕表现不同的自由，这把他牢牢地锁住了。任何一点奋发情绪、任何一点才能、任何一点热情都必须顺从寻求别人的赞同这个目的。……
    美国大学生今天对于任何形式的艺术都十分无知、对政治冷淡、趣味平庸、谈吐无聊，对于他们虚度光阴，寄情于像棒球击球率、投手得分和淫书淫画等美国时行的荒唐玩意儿，一般是毫不介意的。大学生全力来没有意义地追求“‘我们’的快乐”，但是这种寻求是他们的长辈——美国公众最先进行、鼓励、贯彻和为他发扬光大的。
    但是，鉴于啤酒会、复活节游行、投手得分的辩论以及大得汽车房都装不下的耗油奇多的金属怪物（指大型轿车——译）的盛行一时，很可以问一下：我们的社会在这么多方面呈现病态的原因何在？尽管我们的国家赋有富饶的自然资源，有生气勃勃、强壮有力、勤劳生产的人民，以及为这样复杂和庞大的国家和人民设计出来的大概是最优秀、最实际和成功的政府制度，我们仍然好像生了重病，这一重病阻碍了美国整个文化的成长，限制了我们，使我们在这个才华洋溢、物资富足的海洋里只能在绘画、雕刻、文学和哲学方面作出很少一点有价值的文化贡献。贯彻美国生活各方面的病态的中心思想，最能说明美国人民的特点的哲学是“唯利是图”。
    为什么美国的父母们要使他们的子女成为从俗随流的人，成为许许多多但求经济保障的人。为什么美国的父母普遍都不再自豪地说，“这孩子肯定有他自己的主意”，而是说“这孩子真是知道一块钱的价值”？这是因为美国人，普遍的、一般的广大美国人并不真正“知道”一块钱的价值。他们把钱看得太重了。为了钱，他们牺牲一切，并且教导他们的儿子们牺牲一切。
    看来，今天我们的文化价值制度的一个根本的中心思想，我们作为人民和一个国家的普遍的、贯穿一切的目的，是对物质目标的追求。当然，一个制度的一部分如果是按照固定的价格出卖劳务和产品给顾客，以牟取一定程度的利润，那是无可厚非的。但是，当这个牟利的目的走了样，当“利润”的概念开始了毒癌一样的恶性大发展，把这个制度的所有其他方面都罩在它的庞大的、黑暗的、病态的阴影下的时候，当这个制度走样得很厉害，以致“资本主义”只意味着“利润”，而“唯利是图”成了教导青年的最重要的教训的时候——于是，我们的制度固有的竞争办法就超出了是一种经济生活方式的范围，就成了一种社会的、感情的、精神的、道德的和心理的生活方式……成了一种伦理。于是竞争成了感染整个文化的危险的、溃烂的毒素……于是商人通过电视广播节目，靠比赛人间不幸来推销他们的产品……于是著名的牧师表示，他们所宣扬的真纯的宗教上的心灵平静，是能够而且必须像推销质量真纯的肥皂那样来兜售——就是靠演戏、靠舞女、歌手、靠似乎是今天一切商业事业的特征的喧闹而令人厌倦的广告花招来兜售。
    显然，今天美国的半资本主义的经济被太多的人太经常地看作仅仅是牟利的经济了。……
    有着大规模生产的脑子和集体化的血液的“身体健美”的美国，在外表上看起来是十分健康的，然而身患肢端肥大症……手臂太长了，伸出来抢东西的、抓东西的手太大了，太贪婪了，脑子太小了，而且是千篇一律的。这个“怪物”在黑暗中寻求快乐的时候，用钱，用“唯利是图”作为灯塔。这盏灯的萤火虫一样的亮光是这么黯淡、这么微弱、这么不实在、这么细小，它投在狭窄的人人践踏的路上的光是这么不完全，以致这个怪物在颠扑以求达到这个目标的时候，愿意放弃表达，甚至是持有独立理想的权利，如果这些理想同老板、公众、企业……“这些给钱的人”冲突的话。这个怪物不知道为什么他所养育的一代人这么沉默。这是因为——大多数的孩子是这样——他们学爸爸的样，爸爸没有时间说话、交谈、表达思想，因为他除了睡觉以外就是醉眼惺忪地颠扑追求渺茫的、遥远的但是吸引人的更大的物质幸福的目标。　都克大学迪克·瓦瑟曼
