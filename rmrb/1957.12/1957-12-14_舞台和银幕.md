　　Stage and Screen
　　The Intriguing "Borrowing the New Year"
　　The Shandong Lü Opera "Borrowing the New Year" is a program with an exquisite structure and a strong comedic atmosphere. The stage art documentary "Borrowing the New Year" filmed based on it basically retains the characteristics of the original play.
　　"Borrowing the New Year" depicts the story of a poor scholar going to his fiancée's house to borrow the New Year's money on New Year's Eve. It mainly portrays his accidental encounter with his fiancée and his fiancée's sister-in-law teasing them. These plots are very interesting, and through them, the characters' personalities are also quite clearly displayed, allowing us to deeply feel the sincerity and simplicity of this young engaged couple, and the kindness and humor of the sister-in-law.

　　Serial Drama "Investiture of the Gods"
　　The "Investiture of the Gods" performed recently at the Beijing Theater by the Shanghai Xinhua Peking Opera Troupe is a serial drama with stage machinery. Serial dramas with stage machinery have a long history in Shanghai. After liberation, it disappeared for a time, and only reappeared when the repertoire was opened up last year. Its characteristics are: one scene per act, with great emphasis on scenery and lighting, strong plot, and relatively popular lyrics, which are easily accepted by the general audience. However, for a long time, serial dramas were criticized and opposed by audiences because they simply pursued novelty in scenery and illusions, and overshadowed the plot. The Xinhua Peking Opera Troupe has made some improvements in this regard. (Yun)
　　Performances by the New Force of Opera
　　In order to strengthen students' artistic practice and increase their exposure to the audience, the China National Academy of Chinese Theatre Arts has recently increased students' external practice performances. So far, more than sixty performances have been given to the public this year. Recently, they also staged "The Four Scholars," "Mu Guiying," "Jinshan Temple," and "The Zhu Henji Case" in Beijing. Eighth-grade students of the opera school also went to Shandong and other places for practice performances in mid-October. Under the guidance of teachers, these students perform earnestly and seriously, and are making rapid progress. Many of their programs have been welcomed by the audience.

　　舞台和银幕
    趣味盎然的“借年”
    山东吕剧“借年”是一个结构精致、喜剧气氛相当浓厚的节目。根据它拍摄成的舞台艺术纪录片“借年”，基本上保留了原剧的特点。
    “借年”描写了一个穷书生在大除夕到未婚妻家去借年的故事。其中主要表现了他和未婚妻的无意相遇，以及未婚妻的嫂子戏弄他俩等情节。这些情节是非常富于趣味性的，而且通过它们，也相当清晰地展现了人物性格，使我们深切地感到这一对年青的未婚夫妻的真挚、纯朴和嫂子的善良、诙谐等。

    连台本戏“封神榜”
    最近在北京剧场演出的上海市新华京剧团的“封神榜”，是机关布景的连台本戏。机关布景连台本戏在上海有较悠久的历史。解放后曾一度绝迹，直到去年剧目开放时，才又重新出现。它的特点是：一场戏，一场景，十分重视布景和灯光，故事情节强，唱词较通俗，容易为一般观众接受。但是，连台本戏在很长时期内由于单纯地追求新奇的布景和幻术等的效果，喧宾夺主，严重地脱离了剧情，因此受到观众的批评和反对。目前新华京剧团在这方面已有所改进。　（匀）
    戏曲新军的演出
    中国戏曲学校为了加强学生的艺术实践并增多和观众见面，最近增加了学生的对外实习演出。到目前为止，今年已对外演出了六十多场。最近，他们又在北京上演“四进士”、“穆桂英”、“金山寺”、“朱痕记”等剧。戏曲学校八年级的学生在10月中还到山东等外地实习演出过。这些学生在教师的指导下，演出认真、严肃，进步很快。他们很多的剧目都受到了观众的欢迎。
