A Letter from Ukraine to the Children
Ai Wu

I stayed in the Soviet industrial city of Zaporozhye for eleven days. One evening, a little after eight o'clock, I walked out of my hotel room and met a Ukrainian worker. He had probably just come out of the room opposite, after repairing a water pipe, perhaps? He was wearing blue overalls, with pliers and similar tools in his pocket. He enthusiastically grabbed us and asked if we were Chinese. We said we were. He immediately knelt down to perform a salute. We were completely taken aback and quickly helped him up. He hugged and kissed our foreheads and faces, repeatedly shouting things. All I remember was "德加慈巴" (Dejia Ciba - Friendship), and something like "卡克" (Kake). When we went down to the dining hall to eat, we asked the translator, Comrade Markova, what "卡克" meant. She guessed for a while, then added a sound before "卡克" and suddenly understood, saying, "It's 'forever'!" We immediately understood too. The worker was saying our Sino-Soviet friendship is forever. He was about forty years old, strongly built, and he must have been a soldier who fought against the German fascists. When he kissed me, I saw under the light that he had no ear on the left side of his face, only a scar. I didn't see him again after that; he was probably just working at the hotel temporarily. You will ask why he knelt down to salute? You know, my grandfather's generation would kneel down to salute distinguished guests to show the utmost respect. He probably knew that China used to perform this respectful salute, but didn't know that we don't do it anymore. It's been a long time since I've seen it myself. Why would a Ukrainian know about the Chinese custom of kneeling in salute, and use it to treat his most respected guests? I'll tell you slowly!

On our second night in Kyiv, the Ukrainian Writers' Association hosted us with over thirty writers. The first to raise his glass and speak was the white-haired old writer,賀德琴科 (He Deqin Ke), who was seventy-seven years old, speaking about his youth. He participated in both the 1905 and 1917 revolutions. He said that during the 1917 revolution, he participated in the armed uprising in his hometown of尼考来城 (Nikolai City). The bandit马赫诺 (Mahno, A. Tolstoy's novel "1918" wrote about this bandit) came to attack Nikolai City. Their forces were weak, so they withdrew from the city. The Chinese workers in the city, who were hired by the Tsar to build railways, used weapons to resist Mahno's attack and defend the city, which strengthened the revolutionary forces. Later, these Chinese workers also participated in the construction of Soviet socialist industry.贺德琴科 (He Deqin Ke) said that he worked with them, and those Chinese workers were all skilled and disciplined.

Then, the writer明科 (Ming Ke), in his fifties, raised his glass and said that when he was six years old, he really wanted to go to China and India. One day, he took a cloth bag at home, secretly took a piece of bread and a large piece of fatty meat from the kitchen, and also took the thermometer from the wall, putting them all in the bag. Then he secretly left, heading towards China and India. After walking for half a day, he finished eating the bread and fatty meat, but was still hungry, and he missed his mother very much, so he had to hurry home. His family had been looking for him for half a day. When his mother saw him come back, she was overjoyed and quickly scooped a bowl of Ukrainian vegetable soup for him, and put bread in front of him. But his father had been searching for him for half a day, and was exhausted. When he saw him, he scolded him, almost hitting him. He said, laughing, that he still wanted to go to China now. I asked: How many Chinese people were in Ukraine during the 1917 revolution? The female writer阿廖沙·克拉薇茨 (Alyosha Kravitz) said that there were tens of thousands of Chinese workers at that time, all hired by the Tsar to build railways. That night, she brought my Russian short story collection (which she bought herself) for me to sign as a memento. She also gave me a copy of her novel called "The Growth of China and the Soviet Union," which was all about Chinese stories. She had never been to China, but her aunt's husband was Chinese. She inscribed Chinese characters on the novel she gave me: "I, a small person, write small books." The book was not small at all, with seven hundred and twenty pages.

In Zaporozhye, I spoke with索罗维也夫 (Solovyov), the deputy chief engineer of the Zaporozhye Steel Plant. He said that in his hometown of Voroshilovgrad, there is a monument to revolutionary martyrs, with eighty martyrs inscribed in gold on marble walls, ten of whom were Chinese workers.

From the above situations, it seems that the Chinese people left many good impressions on the Ukrainian people in the past, and shed blood for the revolution, so they are commemorated. I speculate that the Ukrainian worker who gave us a kneeling salute must have had contact with Chinese people before.

A few days ago, we had already arrived at the airport, but due to heavy fog in Zaporozhye, we could not take off. After waiting for two days without success, we changed to a bus and traveled from 4:00 PM until 7:00 AM the next morning to Kyiv. We stopped in Kharkiv (the second largest city in Ukraine) for an hour for rest. We got off the bus and rested on the sidewalk. A worker walked up to us, gesticulating and speaking. We didn't understand what he was saying, and thought he was drunk, but he walked a dozen yards away, then turned back, took off his hat, and shouted loudly to us: "Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong!" It turned out that Mao Zedong's arrival in Moscow was being broadcast that night. We heard it on the radio in the long-distance bus, and he was obviously excited and madly enthusiastic about the news as well.

    从乌克兰寄给孩子们的信
    艾芜
    我在苏联的工业城市查波罗什城住过十一天。有一天晚上八点多钟，走出旅馆房间，遇见一个乌克兰工人，他大概从对面房里修水管出来吧？穿着蓝色工作服口袋里还装着老虎钳之类的工具，热情地拉着我们问是不是中国人？我们就说是。他立即跪下去行礼。我们简直慌极了，连忙把他扶起来，他就抱着吻我们的额头和脸，连喊好些话，我只记得有“德加慈巴”（友谊），还喊什么“卡克”。下去饭厅吃饭的时候，我们问翻译马尔科娃同志卡克是什么意思，她猜了好一阵，才在“卡克”前面加一个音，恍然大悟的说：“是永久呀”。我们也一下了解了，那个工人是说我们中苏友谊是永久的。他年纪约有四十多岁，身体强壮，他一定当过兵打过德国法西斯的，同我接吻的时候，我就在灯光下看见他左边脸颊没有耳朵，只有一个疤痕。以后就没有看见他了，他大约是临时到旅馆来工作的。他为什么跪下行礼？你们会问这句话的。你们知道吗？我的祖父那代人，见着尊贵的客人，就要跪下行礼，表示非常的尊敬。他大概知道中国行这种尊贵的礼，而不知道我们中国现在已不行这种礼了，我也好久没有看见过。乌克兰人为什么会知道中国行跪拜的礼，去对待他最尊敬的客人呢？这一点我慢慢告诉你们吧！
    我们到基辅的第二天晚上，乌克兰作家协会有三十多个作家招待我们。第一个举起杯来讲话的是白发满头的老作家贺德琴科，有七十七岁了，举着杯讲他年青的事情。他参加过1905年和1917年两次革命。他说1917年革命他在他家尼考来城参加武装起义，土匪马赫诺（阿·托尔斯泰的小说“1918年”写到过这个匪徒）来攻尼考来城。他们力量单薄，便退出了城。城内的中国工人，是沙皇雇来修铁路的，都用武器抵抗马赫诺的进攻，保卫了城市，而革命的人们也因此增加了力量。后来这些中国工人还参加建设苏联社会主义工业的工作。贺德琴科说，他同他们一道工作过，那些中国工人都会作工，而且守纪律。
    接着，五十多岁的作家明科，又举起杯来说：他六岁的时候，就很想去中国和印度，有一天就在家里拿一个布袋，还从厨房里悄悄拿一个面包，和一大块肥肉，又把壁上的寒暑表取下，全放进口袋，然后偷偷地走了，一直向中国和印度走去·走了半天，面包夹肥肉吃完了，肚子还饿，又非常想念他的妈妈，于是只好赶快回家。他家里人已找了他半天。妈妈一见他回来，喜欢得了不得，连忙舀碗乌克兰菜汤给他吃，又把面包送到他面前。可是爸爸寻了他半天，累得不得了，一见他，就骂他，差不多要打他一顿。他说到这里的时候，笑着说，他现在还想到中国去。我问：当1917年革命的时候有多少中国人在乌克兰？女作家阿廖沙·克拉薇茨就说，那时有上万的中国工人，都是沙皇雇来修铁路的。她在这天晚上把我的俄文短篇小说集拿来（是她自己买的）要我签字留纪念。又送我一本她作的长篇小说名叫“中苏的成长”，里面全写的中国人的故事，她没有到过中国，但她的姨父是中国人。她在送我的长篇小说上还题上中国字：“我，小的人，我写小的书。”书实在不小，有七百二十页。
    在查波罗什城，我同查波罗什钢铁厂的副总工程师索罗维也夫谈过话，他说他家乡伏罗希洛夫格勒有革命时的烈士纪念碑，是用大理石镶在壁上写上金字，共有八十个烈士，其中有十名就是中国工人。
    从以上的情形看来，中国人过去留给乌克兰人许多好的印象，而且为革命流过血，因此他们才加以纪念。我推测那个向我们行跪拜之礼的乌克兰工人，先前一定同中国人有过来往的。
    几天前本来已到飞机场了，因查波罗什雾大，不能起飞，等了两天也走不成，我们就改乘公共汽车，从下午四时走到第二天早上七时到基辅。半夜在哈尔科夫（乌克兰第二大城市）停车休息一小时，我们下车来在街上人行道歇歇，一个工人走到我们面前，手舞足蹈地讲话。我们不懂话，以为他吃醉了，但他走了一两丈远，又回头来，揭下帽子，大声地向我们喊：“毛泽东！毛泽东！”原来这一夜正广播毛主席到达莫斯科的消息，我们在长途汽车上的收音机里也听见了，显然他也为这一消息兴奋得发狂了。
