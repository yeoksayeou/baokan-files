　　Telephones are playing an increasingly important role in the lives of modern people. What will telephones be like in the near future? This is a question that everyone is interested in.
    In the future, the telephone will probably look like a small box placed on the table. The telephone receiver will be invisible, installed inside the machine. The dial will be replaced by buttons. According to another plan, even buttons may not be needed; just speaking a phone number aloud would suffice, and the rest of the work will be done by semiconductors. Some scientific research institutes in the Soviet Union have already begun to study the establishment of new-style telephone machines.
    The Soviet Union is currently studying the establishment of new types of mechanical-electronic telephone exchanges. In these telephone exchanges, the work of finding lines is done by fast-acting electronic equipment. Errors and noise can be greatly reduced. Even more attractive is the possibility of establishing all-electronic telephone exchanges, based on the principles of electronic computers and magnetic computers, which can find the required line from millions of lines extremely quickly, without human intervention.
    Currently, there is a practical problem that telephones cannot be installed in some places due to line limitations. Now, relevant research institutes in the Soviet Union believe that high-frequency settings for long-distance calls can also be used in cities, meaning that dozens of telephones can talk simultaneously on one line. In this way, only three to five telephone lines would need to be installed in a residential area of ​​one hundred households.
    The Leningrad Institute is also studying several plans for rural telephone exchanges. One is a telephone exchange within a collective farm or a district that does not require an operator. Another exchange is specifically for communication between machine tractor stations and villages. In addition, a rural economic telephone exchange that saves the most power and does not require any staff is also being designed.
    Since 1952, the Soviet Union has begun to use semi-automated long-distance telephone equipment. That is to say, an operator in City A can directly connect to a user in City B, saving one operator. In the near future, the Soviet Union will adopt fully automated domestic long-distance telephone equipment, at which time, users in City A can directly call users in City B without reservation or the help of an operator. This raises another question: how to calculate the time and cost of long-distance calls? Here again, we need to rely on electronics. Electronic equipment can remember everything; it can automatically determine the phone number, the name of the city, the date and time of the call, the duration of the call, and the price. Based on these records, accurate bills can be issued to users. (Bing Yun) (Attached picture)

### 将来电话会变成什么样？

　　将来电话会变成什么样？
    电话在现代人民的生活中起着愈来愈重要的作用。到底，在不久的将来，电话会变成个什么样子呢？这个问题是大家所感到兴趣的。
    将来，电话机的样子大概是一只不大的匣子，它放在桌上。电话听筒是看不见的，它装在机子的里面。拨号盘将被电钮所代替。按另一种方案，甚至连电钮都用不着，只需要大声地讲出一个电话号码就够了，而其他的工作将由半导体来完成。目前苏联的一些科学研究所已经着手研究建立新式的电话机器。
    现在苏联正在研究建立新型的机械电子电话交换所。在这种电话交换所里寻找线路的工作是由动作很快的电子设备来完成的。差错和杂音可以大大地减少。更为吸引人的是有可能建立全部电子设备电话交换所，根据电子计算机和磁石计算机的原则建立起来的电话交换所能极快地从数百万条线路里找到所需要的那条线路，而不需要人去管。
    目前，在实际生活还存在着这样一个问题，由于线路的限制，有些地方就不能装上电话。现在，苏联的有关研究所认为，在市内也可以运用长途电话的高频设置，也就是说，在一条线路上可以有几十只电话机同时通话。这样，在一百户的住宅区里只安设三、五副电话线路就够了。
    列宁格勒研究所还在研究几种农村电话交换所的方案。一种是不需要接线员的一个集体农庄内部或一个区内的电话交换所。另一种交换所是专门供机器拖拉机站与村庄联系的。此外，还在设计一种最省电力又不需任何工作人员的农村经济电话交换所。
    从1952年开始，苏联开始使用半自动化的长途电话设备。也就是说，甲城的接线员可以直接挂乙城用户的电话，这样就省掉一个接线员。在不久的将来，苏联将采用完全自动化的国内长途电话设备，那时，甲城的用户可以直接挂乙城用户的电话，不需预约也不需接线生的帮助。这样又会产生一个问题，就是怎样计算长途通话的时间和价钱呢？这里又需要借助于电子了。电子设备能够记住一切，它能自动地判断出电话的号码，城市的名称，挂电话的日子和时间，通话的时间和价钱。根据这些记载就能给用户开出确切的账单来。（丙　匀）（附图片）
    这是列宁格勒莫斯科大街上一幢房子的新型自动电话分站。这个站为一百户服务，而线路总共才有二十副。
