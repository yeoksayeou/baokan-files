    Beijing News: On the basis of the decisive victory in the anti-rightist struggle, national universities and colleges have successively entered the third stage of the rectification movement in October—the stage of focusing on rectification and improvement. In accordance with the spirit of the Central Committee's "resolutely unleashing, boldly unleashing, and thoroughly unleashing" and "resolutely reforming, boldly reforming, and thoroughly reforming," the Party committees of various schools once again mobilized the masses, setting off a high tide of airing views and improving work. According to preliminary statistics from universities and colleges in Beijing, as of November 30, teachers, students, and staff had put forward a total of 327,000 opinions, nearly 192,000 of which had been dealt with, with most schools having dealt with more than 50% of the issues raised. By early November, universities and colleges in Shanghai had put forward more than 127,000 opinions, and according to preliminary statistics from eleven universities and colleges, more than 5,000 opinions have been dealt with. In Shanxi Province, the four universities and colleges put forward more than 7,000 opinions in less than a week after Tao Lujia, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, made a mobilization report. At present, universities and colleges are improving their work with a revolutionary spirit, and a lively and dynamic new situation has begun to emerge. Some problems that were previously considered unsolvable or had been delayed for a long time are now being quickly resolved. The rectification and improvement work is now deepening, and some schools are conducting thematic airing of views and launching major debates in conjunction with the improvement of work, while some schools are preparing to review the rectification and improvement work of the previous stage.

  Strengthening the Training of Intellectuals from the Working Class

    In the anti-rightist struggle, many people deeply realized that to build socialism, it is necessary to cultivate a contingent of intellectuals from the working class. Therefore, how to cultivate working-class intellectuals in universities and colleges has become one of the main issues in this airing of views and rectification.

    Many people have put forward opinions on implementing the policy of opening universities and colleges to workers and peasants. For example, some people believe that the across-the-board cancellation of subsidies for cadres transferred from work and the suspension of worker-peasant rapid middle schools have to some extent affected workers and peasants from entering universities. Others have also pointed out that universities and colleges provide insufficient assistance to worker-peasant students, pay insufficient attention to their learning difficulties, and some teachers even have discriminatory thoughts towards worker-peasant students. At present, in addition to the Ministry of Higher Education assisting the State Council in vigorously studying and solving how to implement the class line and increase the proportion of worker-peasant students in universities and colleges, many schools have taken various measures to help worker-peasant students overcome learning difficulties. For example, Shandong Institute of Technology has specifically studied how to strengthen the teaching and tutoring of worker-peasant students and has assigned teachers to strengthen the teaching of problem-solving classes for worker-peasant classes. Peking University recently also held a meeting specifically to discuss the issue of cultivating worker-peasant students.

    Cultivating new intellectuals with a revolutionary spirit, reforming and strengthening ideological and political education and labor education in schools are important aspects of cultivating working-class intellectuals. Under the leadership of the Party committees, various schools have opened or are preparing to open courses on socialist education and have strengthened ideological and political education. Jiaotong University sent twenty-five Party member cadres to various departments to do political work and designated nineteen Party members, including Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee Hu Xinren and Party Committee member Deng Xuchu, to serve as teachers of political courses, Party courses, and current affairs and policy courses. The rectification movement has given socialist ideological education extremely rich content and a lively and dynamic debate method, enabling everyone to deeply understand the issues. For example, regarding the issue of "specialization first, then redness" versus "both red and expert," tens of thousands of college students in Shanghai conducted nearly a month of intense debate, enabling the vast majority of students to realize that college students in socialist countries must take the path of "both red and expert." Beijing Petroleum Institute discussed the relationship between physical labor and ideological transformation, and Beijing Medical College discussed the issue of "should college students clean toilets?" These discussions have deeply educated the students.

    Labor education in various schools is also being strengthened, and a new trend of actively participating in physical labor is beginning to form. Schools frequently organize teachers and students to participate in agricultural production, repair campuses, playgrounds, roads, and clean classrooms and dormitories. Harbin Institute of Technology once organized teachers and students to help farmers harvest crops overnight. Shanxi Agricultural College organized more than 1,000 teachers and students to help farmers with the autumn harvest for three days. Shanghai First Normal College established a cooperative relationship with agricultural cooperatives and decided that all teachers and students in the college would go to the countryside for labor once a month and for one to two weeks during the summer vacation. The Communist Youth League branch of the Physics Department of Fudan University initiated a regular "Communist Voluntary Labor Day." Many schools have established physical labor committees and other institutions to lead this work. At present, the State Council is studying a system for students and graduates to participate in physical labor, so that participation in labor can be consolidated institutionally.

    While strengthening ideological and political education, many schools have also launched struggles against theft and hooliganism. This struggle is also a vivid socialist education lesson.

    Improving Teaching and Scientific Research Work

    During the airing of views, teachers and students raised many opinions on teaching and scientific research work. According to statistics, the opinions on teaching and scientific research work raised by teachers, students, and staff in Beijing universities and colleges accounted for more than 31% of all opinions. The opinions raised included: excessive study burden, repetition of study content, poor teaching quality, insufficient connection with practice, and poor organization of production internships. Various schools have treated this issue as a central link in the rectification and improvement. Many schools have paid attention to streamlining class hours and increasing elective courses. Beijing Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics and Beijing Petroleum Institute have both revised their teaching plans, reducing class hours from 30 to 34 hours per week to 24 to 26 hours per week. Renmin University of China decided to reduce class hours for first, second, and third-year students to 18 to 20 hours per week, and for fourth-year students to 16 hours per week. Beijing Normal University organized the majority of teachers to study and solve long-standing problems related to problem-solving classes, student assignments, lectures by young teaching assistants, and tutoring. The Mathematics Department and Biology Department of Peking University have held a series of meetings to study strengthening the leadership of teaching and research offices, collective activities of teaching groups, and the contact between teaching assistants and students, and have criticized the teaching attitude of some teachers. In scientific research, attention has been paid to the direction of combining with practice and with the country's socialist construction, and various conditions for scientific research have been improved as much as possible, such as improving the supply of materials and improving library work.

    Resolutely Implement the Policy of Running Schools Diligently and Thriftily

    Checking extravagance and waste, establishing a school spirit of diligence, thrift, hard work, and running schools diligently and thriftily is being promoted in many schools. Tsinghua University has checked the phenomenon of waste in laboratory equipment and has done a better job in this regard. The Chemistry Department of Peking University exposed the waste caused by lax equipment management. In the past four days alone, nearly 18,000 pieces of glass instruments, nearly 8,000 pieces of porcelain, ironware, woodwork, and electrical materials, and more than 2,200 bottles of medicines, and 259 instruments worth more than ten yuan were recovered from teachers and students. Some people, in the name of scientific research, locked instruments such as cameras and microscopes in cabinets for their own use. Exposing the phenomenon of backlog and waste is of great significance for implementing the policy of running schools diligently and thriftily.

    Waste in basic construction is also very serious. Many schools have wasted resources in the construction of laboratories, classrooms, etc., under the guidance of the idea of pursuing large-scale and new projects. Some schools have occupied too much land. According to the inspection by the Ministry of Higher Education, nine schools, including Xi'an Jiaotong University, have wasted 1,800 mu of land, accounting for nearly two-fifths of the land area of the nine schools.

    Streamlining institutions, transferring personnel, and improving work are also important aspects of implementing "running schools diligently and thriftily." According to preliminary estimates from most universities and colleges in Beijing and Hubei, the current number of administrative staff who can be streamlined and transferred is about 25%-30%. Renmin University of China plans to streamline 880 faculty and staff, accounting for about 35% of the total number of people. The school headquarters has been reduced by almost 50%, and surplus cadres have been transferred to strengthen the grassroots. At present, only four schools, including Renmin University of China, Tsinghua University, Beijing Foreign Affairs College, and Beijing Agricultural University, have transferred 970 cadres. A high tide of demanding to go to factories and rural areas to participate in labor and settle down is forming.

        Earnestly Improve Leadership Style

    The style of university and college leaders going deep into the masses, going deep into teaching, and overcoming bureaucracy is growing. Wu Yuzhang, President of Renmin University of China, posted a big-character poster, expressing his acceptance of the students' opinions and his willingness to spend more time going deep into the grassroots and meeting with students more often. This big-character poster was warmly welcomed by the students. Many schools have stipulated the time for the president and Party committee secretary to meet with the masses, and many presidents and deans often eat in the students' dining halls or participate in the students' activities to understand the students' living conditions.

    Many school leaders have begun to go deep into teaching. The vice president of Beijing Normal University listens to teachers' lectures, and the presidents and Party committee secretaries of Northeast People's University and Changchun Automobile Tractor Institute have participated in the work of teaching and research offices. This is of great benefit to improving teaching quality.

    Sending cadres to the grassroots of schools is an effective way to overcome detachment from reality. In fifteen universities and colleges in Shanghai, 350 cadres have been transferred from the school's Party and government leadership departments to serve as general branch secretaries, department heads, and assistant department heads in various departments. For example, Fudan University transferred 34 Party member cadres to serve as student Party branch secretaries, and the Party committee of Shanghai First Medical College transferred nearly half of all transferred cadres. Many Communist Youth League cadres eat, live, entertain, and study with the students.

    The Ministry of Higher Education is Seizing the Rectification and Improvement Work

    At present, under the leadership of the Central Committee and the State Council, the Ministry of Higher Education is focusing on strengthening ideological and political education, implementing the class line in training cadres, checking and overcoming waste, streamlining institutions and transferring personnel, implementing the policy of running schools diligently and thriftily, and solving problems such as the leadership system of higher education and secondary specialized education. At the same time, problems are being categorized and summarized into problems such as political and ideological education, teaching and scientific research, continuing education and implementation of the class line, and secondary specialized education. All leading comrades are divided into seven thematic research groups to leverage the strength of the masses and are required to complete their tasks on schedule according to plan. At present, the Ministry of Higher Education has initially drafted "Instructions on Effectively Implementing the Policy of Building the Country Diligently and Thriftily and Running Schools Diligently and Thriftily," which will be issued to various schools for implementation, and has drafted documents such as "Several Opinions (Draft) on Improving the Examination System" and "Opinions and Reference Programs on Formulating Teachers' Teaching Workload Distribution Methods in Universities and Colleges," which are prepared to be issued to some universities and colleges for conducting large-scale airing of views, large-scale unleashing of views, and large-scale debates in conjunction with rectification and improvement, so as to further revise them before implementation.

    The Ministry of Higher Education notified various schools on October 8 to report problems that need to be solved by the ministry. As of November 23, a total of 73 schools reported 1,417 opinions. Among them, 335 opinions have been transferred to other units for handling, and the relevant departments and offices of the Ministry of Higher Education are actively studying and handling the remaining more than 1,000 opinions. In order to understand the rectification and improvement situation of schools more timely and deeply, some leading comrades have contacted relevant universities and colleges in Beijing to read big-character posters and participate in certain rectification and improvement meetings. In addition, responsible comrades from local higher education bureaus were invited to Beijing to report on the rectification and improvement situation of universities and colleges.

    全国高等学校正以革命精神改进工作
    生气勃勃群情活跃的新局面开始出现
    本报讯　全国高等学校在反右派斗争取得决定性胜利的基础上，于10月间先后转入整风运动的第三阶段——着重整改阶段。各校党委根据中央“坚决地放、大胆地放、彻底地放”和“坚决地改、大胆地改、彻底地改”的精神，再次发动群众，掀起了一个鸣放和改进工作的热潮。据北京市各高等学校的初步统计，到11月30日，师生员工共提出三十二万七千条意见，已处理的近十九万二千条，多数学校已处理的问题在50％以上。上海各高等学校到11月上旬共提出十二万七千多条意见，据十一所高等学校的初步统计，已经处理了五千多条意见。山西省四所高等学校在省委书记陶鲁笳作动员报告后不到一个星期，就提出了七千多条意见。目前高等学校正以革命的精神来改进工作，出现了生气勃勃、群情活跃的新局面，有些过去认为不能解决或长期拖延不解决的问题，现在都能很快地解决了。整改工作现在已经走向深入，有些学校结合改进工作，正进行专题鸣放，开展大争大辩，有些学校对前一阶段的整改工作正准备进行复查。
  加强培养工人阶级知识分子
    在反右派斗争中，许多人都深刻地认识到，要建成社会主义，必须培养工人阶级的知识分子队伍。因此，如何在高等学校中培养工人阶级知识分子成为这次鸣放和整改的主要问题之一。
    不少人对贯彻高等学校向工农开门的方针提出了意见。例如，有人认为笼统地取消调干助学金和停办工农速成中学都在一定程度上影响了工农学生升入大学，也有人提出高等学校对工农学生帮助少，对他们学习上的困难注意帮助不够，部分教师甚至存在歧视工农学生的思想。目前，除了高等教育部协助国务院大力研究解决如何贯彻阶级路线、增加高等学校的工农成分学生外，许多学校都采取了各种措施来帮助工农学生克服学习上的困难，如山东工学院专门研究了如何加强工农学生的教学和辅导，并且抽调了教师加强了工农班习题课的教学工作。北京大学最近也召开会议专门讨论关于培养工农学生的问题。
    用革命精神培养新的知识分子，革新和加强学校中的思想政治教育和劳动教育，是培养工人阶级知识分子的重要方面。各校在党委领导下，已经开设或准备开设社会主义教育课程，并且加强了思想政治教育工作。交通大学派了二十五名党员干部到各系作政治工作，并确定党委副书记胡辛人、党委委员邓旭初等十九名党员担任政治课、党课和时事政策课的教员。整风运动给社会主义思想教育以极其丰富的内容，生动活泼的辩论方式，使大家能够深刻地认识问题。比如对“先专后红”还是“又红又专”的问题，上海市上万大学生进行了将近一个月的激烈辩论，使绝大多数同学认识到社会主义国家的大学生必须走“又红又专”的道路。北京石油学院讨论了体力劳动和思想改造的关系问题，北京医学院讨论了“大学生应不应该打扫厕所”的问题。这些讨论使学生受到深刻的教育。
    各校劳动教育也在加强，开始形成踊跃参加体力劳动的新风气。学校经常组织师生参加农业生产、修整校园、操场、道路，打扫教室、宿舍等劳动。哈尔滨工业大学曾组织师生帮助农民连夜抢收庄稼。山西农学院组织师生千余人帮助农民秋收三天。上海第一师范学院和农业社建立协作关系，决定全院师生每月下乡劳动一次，暑期下乡一至二周。复旦大学共青团物理系教师支部倡议举行经常性的“共产主义义务劳动日”。许多学校成立了体力劳动委员会等机构领导这一工作。现在，国务院正在研究在校学生和毕业生参加体力劳动的制度，使参加劳动能从制度上巩固下来。
    在加强思想政治教育的同时，许多学校都开展了反盗窃、流氓的斗争。这场斗争也是一堂活生生的社会主义教育课。
    改进教学和科学研究工作
    在鸣放中师生对教学和科学研究工作提了很多意见。据统计北京市高等学校师生员工所提教学和科学研究方面的意见占全部意见的31％多。所提的意见如：学习负担过重、学习内容重复、讲课质量不高、联系实际不够、生产实习组织不好等。各校都把这个问题作为整改中的中心环节来对待。许多学校注意了精简学时，增加选修课。北京航空学院和北京石油学院都修改了教学计划，把上课时数从每周三十至三十四学时减少到每周二十四至二十六学时。中国人民大学决定把一、二、三年级学生每周上课时间减为十八至二十学时，四年级减为每周十六学时。北京师范大学组织广大教师研究解决了长期无法解决的有关习题课、学生作业、年轻助教讲课、辅导等问题。北京大学数学系、生物系等都召开了一系列的会议，研究加强教研室领导、教学小组集体活动、助教和学生联系等问题，并对某些教师的教学态度提出批评。在科学研究方面，注意了和实践结合、和国家社会主义建设相结合的方向，尽量改善科学研究的各种条件，如改善资料供应、改进图书馆工作等。
    坚决贯彻勤俭办学的方针
    检查铺张浪费、树立勤俭朴素、艰苦奋斗、勤俭办学的校风正在许多学校中推行。清华大学检查了实验室设备方面的浪费现象，在这方面做的较好。北京大学化学系揭发了设备管理不严造成的浪费现象。最近不到四天中就从师生手里清回了玻璃仪器近一万八千件，瓷器、铁器、木器、电料等近八千件，药品二千二百多瓶，价值十元以上的仪器二百五十九件。有的人以科学研究为名，把照像机、显微镜等仪器，锁在柜子里，据为己有。揭发积压浪费现象，对贯彻勤俭办学方针有很大意义。
    基本建设方面的浪费也很严重。不少学校在求大、求新的思想指导下，修建的实验室、教室等都有浪费。有的学校占用土地过多，据高等教育部检查，仅西安交通大学等九校就浪费土地一千八百亩，几占九校用地面积的五分之二。
    紧缩机构，下放人员，改进工作也是贯彻“勤俭办学”的重要方面。据北京、湖北两地多数高等学校初步估计，目前可精简下放的行政职工约25％—30％左右。中国人民大学拟精简教职员工八百八十人，占总人数的35％左右。校部编制几乎裁减50％，多余的干部下放充实基层，目前仅中国人民大学、清华大学、北京外交学院和北京农业大学等四校，已下放干部九百七十人。要求到工厂农村去参加劳动和安家落户的热潮正在形成。
        认真改进领导作风
    高等学校领导深入群众、深入教学克服官僚主义的作风正在成长。中国人民大学吴玉章校长贴了一张大字报，表示接受同学们的意见，愿意多抽一些时间深入下层，多和同学见面。这张大字报受到同学们的热烈欢迎。许多学校都规定了校长、党委书记接见群众的时间，许多校院长已经常常在同学们的饭厅吃饭或参加同学们的活动，借以了解同学们的生活情况。
    许多学校领导同志已开始深入教学，北京师范大学副校长听教师讲课，东北人民大学和长春汽车拖拉机学院等校的校院长和党委书记都参加了教研室的工作。这对提高教学质量有很大好处。
    向学校基层派干部是克服脱离实际的有效办法，上海市十五所高等学校里，从学校党政领导部门调往各系作总支书记、系主任、系主任助理等工作的干部已有三百五十名，如复旦大学下放三十四名党员干部作学生党支部书记，上海第一医学院党委下放干部几占全体下放干部的一半，许多共青团的干部和同学同吃、同住、同娱乐、同学习。
    高等教育部抓紧整改工作
    目前，高等教育部在中央和国务院的领导下，以加强思想政治教育工作，贯彻培养干部中的阶级路线、检查克服浪费、精简机构下放人员，贯彻勤俭办学方针，以及解决高等教育、中等专业教育领导体制等问题为研究中心。同时，把问题排队，归纳为政治思想教育、教学及科学研究、业余教育及贯彻阶级路线以及中等专业教育等问题。将全部领导同志分为七个专题研究小组，发挥群众力量，要求按计划按时完成任务。目前，高等教育部已初步拟出“关于切实贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭办学方针的指示”，即将发给各校执行，并拟出“关于改进考试制度的几点意见（初稿）”“关于高等学校制定教师教学工作量分配办法的意见和参考方案”等文件，准备发给部分高等学校，结合整改，进行大鸣、大放、大辩论，以便进一步修改后实行。
    高等教育部曾于10月8日通知各校报送需要部里解决的问题，截至11月23日止，共七十三所学校，报来意见一千四百一十七条，其中除了三百三十五条意见已转其他单位处理外，其余一千多条意见，高等教育部有关司、处正在积极研究处理。为了更及时深入地了解学校整改情况，部分领导同志分别和北京市有关高等学校联系，看大字报、参加一定的整改会议。另外，分别约各地高教局负责同志来京汇报高等学校整改情况。
