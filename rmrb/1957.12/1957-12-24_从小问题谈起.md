　　The Pricing Bureau of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, when discussing streamlining its organization, once argued for a long time about whether to reduce two more people or two less. Generally speaking, reducing two more or two less people is not a very complicated issue. Why did it cause such a big dispute? It turned out that it involved how the bureau chiefs and other leading cadres worked. In the past, leading cadres above the level of bureau chief in this bureau generally did not handle problems themselves. Those who advocated reducing two fewer people believed that the bureau chiefs would not do practical work as in the past. Those who insisted on reducing two more people were actually against this bad work style and wanted the leading cadres to handle things themselves. After the leadership clarified the issue, the opinions became consistent. Bureau chiefs should personally study one or two price issues. In this way, the problem of reducing two more or two less people was readily solved. Reducing two more people is of course a good thing. However, what is more important is that this debate touched on the working methods and leadership style of leading cadres.

　　The Rubber Bureau and the Pharmaceutical Bureau of the Ministry of Chemical Industry live in the same courtyard. Both units have only about a hundred people. However, they each have their own sets of canteens, bathrooms, tea stoves, and receiving and dispatching services. Not only that, but both parties have to put locks on the doors of the courtyard wall, making the two brother units living in the same courtyard not communicate with each other, like disharmonious brothers who have separated in the old society. During this rectification, this situation was changed. The locks were removed, the doors were opened, and the canteens, bathrooms, etc. of the two agencies were also merged. In this way, not only manpower and material resources were saved, but also the staff of the two units interacted and communicated with each other. This certainly cannot be regarded as a big problem. However, if we do not stop at the superficial phenomena of these specific problems and ask further, why do two socialist state organs live together like separated brothers in the old society? This will naturally make people think of the undesirable trend of departmentalism that is prevalent in our enterprises, which is unwillingness to cooperate and unwillingness to support each other. Isn't this unwillingness to interact and unwillingness to work together between the two bureaus a concrete and subtle manifestation of that unwillingness to cooperate? In the big picture, we want to promote collaboration and oppose departmentalism. Can we tolerate this bad idea in small matters? It is relatively easy to solve specific problems, but it will take some effort to eradicate this bad idea. However, if we only solve specific problems without touching the essence of the problem, then this idea will grow and reproduce when it encounters a suitable climate and soil.

　　Many units, after the big blooming and big contending, are concentrating their efforts on solving general problems that are easy to solve first. Some people call this picking sesame seeds or sweeping sesame seeds. Of course, compared to some issues such as guiding principles, policies, organizational structures, etc., what is being solved now are indeed mostly small problems. However, can we regard them as trivial matters that do not involve any principles or ideological style? As can be seen from the two small things mentioned above, although some things are not of great importance and the problems are not very complicated, they are precisely concrete and prominent manifestations of three bad styles. That is to say, small problems often conceal some far-reaching big problems. As long as we analyze small problems carefully, we can get inspiration from them.

　　Usually, many leaders look down on various specific small problems, letting them drag on for three or five years, making the agency full of problems. This situation not only cultivates the old and sluggish style of everyone not taking action to solve problems when facing them, but also breeds and spreads various molds from these problems, invisibly corroding our work and thinking. This time, we thoroughly cleared it out and dealt with it, making our agency full of fresh air, which in itself is of great significance. However, if it only stops there, it is not enough. Since small problems hide big problems in terms of ideological style, these things must be unearthed. We are conducting rectification, not a general improvement of work. We must not only solve specific problems, but also find the root causes of these specific problems. Sesame seeds can be squeezed into oil. If we sweep up sesame seeds and put them in bags without taking them to squeeze oil, we only solve half of the problem. Don't think that what is being solved or has been solved are mostly small problems. As long as we are good at digging out and clearing away the things hidden deep in the problems, we can greatly and severely attack the three bad styles in the general rectification stage.

    从小问题谈起
    易槐
    合作总社物价局在讨论紧缩机构的时候，曾经为多减两个人少减两个人的问题争执了很久。一般说，多减两个人少减两个人并不是十分复杂的问题，为什么会引起很大的争论呢？原来这里边牵扯到各处处长等领导干部怎样工作的问题。过去，这个局的处长以上的领导干部一般都不亲自动手处理问题。主张应该少减两个人的，认为处长们还像过去一样不做实际工作；坚持要多减两个人的，实际就是反对这种不良作风，要领导干部亲自动手。领导方面把问题明朗化后，意见就一致起来。处长应该亲自动手研究一两种物价问题。这样，多减两个人少减两个人的问题也就迎刃而解了。多减两个人，当然是一件好事。可是，更为重要的是这个辩论触及到领导干部的工作方法、领导作风问题。
    化工部的橡胶局和医药局住在一个院子里，两个单位的人员都不过百人左右。食堂、浴室、茶炉、收发等却都各搞一套。这还不算，两家还都要在院墙的门上加上锁锁起来，使得住在一个院里的两个兄弟单位不通声气，像旧社会里分了家的不和睦的兄弟一样。这次整改中，改变了这种状况，锁去掉了，门打开了，两个机关的食堂、浴室等也都合办起来了。这样，不仅节约了人力物力，而且两个单位的工作人员互相来往互通声气了。这当然不能算是大问题。可是，如果不停留在这些具体问题的表面现象上面，再追问一下，为什么两个社会主义的国家机关却像旧社会的分了家的弟兄一样住在一起呢？这自然会使人想起流行在我们企业里的那种不愿协作不愿相互配合支援的本位主义歪风。这两个局的这种不愿来往不愿共事的状况，不正是那种不愿协作的思想的具体而细微的表现吗？在大的方面，我们要提倡协作反对本位主义，在小问题方面，我们是否就可以容忍这种坏思想呢？解决具体问题是比较容易的，要拔除这种坏思想就不能不费一点劲了。但是如果只是解决具体问题而不触及问题的本质，那末这种思想遇到适宜的气候土壤，就又会滋长繁殖起来。
    许多单位在大放大鸣之后，正在集中力量首先解决容易解决的一般性的问题。有人把这叫做拣芝麻或扫芝麻。当然，比起某些方针政策机构体制等问题，现在解决的的确大多是小问题。可是，能不能就把它们看成是不牵扯什么原则什么思想作风的鸡毛蒜皮的小事呢？从前面谈到的两件不大的事情中可以看出，有些事情关系虽不重大，问题也并不十分复杂，可是，它却正是三个坏主义的具体的突出的表现。也就是说，小问题的后面经常掩盖着某些意义深远的大问题。只要把小问题认真做些分析，就会从中得到启发。
    平常，有很多领导看不起各种具体的小问题，任凭它拖上三年五载，弄得机关里问题成堆，这种状况不但养成了大家面对问题不去动手解决的老大疲沓作风，而且从这些问题中还会滋生蔓延出各种霉菌，无形地腐蚀着我们的工作和思想。这一次，我们把它彻底清除出来加以处理，使我们的机关中充满了清新的气息，这本身就有极大的意义。可是，如果仅止于此，那还不够。既然小问题后面掩盖着思想作风方面的大问题，就要把这些东西挖掘出来。我们是整风，不是一般的改进工作，既要解决具体问题，还要找出产生这些具体问题的根源。芝麻是可以榨出油来的，扫起芝麻就装在袋里而不拿去榨油，只是解决了问题的一半。不要看正在解决或已经解决的大都是小问题，只要我们善于从中挖掘并清除问题深处隐藏着的东西，在一般整改阶段，就可以大大地狠狠地打击三个坏主义。
