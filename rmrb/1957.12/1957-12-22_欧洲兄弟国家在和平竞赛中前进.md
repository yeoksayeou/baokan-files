Xinhua News Agency, December 20th:
    European brotherly countries are advancing in the peaceful competition.
    Czechoslovakia's steel rolling equipment is at the same level as the United States, Poland's coal production is more than twice that of France, East Germany is the world's largest producer of lignite coal, Romania's oil production ranks second in Europe, Bulgaria's coal and electricity production are the first in the Balkans...

    The industrial production of European People's Democratic countries is booming.

    Currently, the number of machine tools exported by Czechoslovakia accounts for one-tenth of the total machine tool exports of all capitalist countries. Czechoslovakia's current production of hard coal ranks seventh in Europe and twelfth in the world, and steel ranks eighth in Europe and tenth in the world. On a per capita basis, Czechoslovakia produces more electricity than France and Italy, and its steel rolling equipment has reached the same level as the United States. The production of motorcycles and washing machines both rank first in the world.

    Compared with European capitalist countries, the industrial output of Poland and East Germany are second only to Britain, France, and West Germany. Last year, Poland produced about twice as much coal as France. Poland's machine production has more than doubled that of Italy. On a per capita basis, Poland's industrial production exceeds that of France. Due to the enormous development of the machinery manufacturing industry, East Germany is now the second-largest machinery manufacturing and exporting country among socialist countries, second only to the Soviet Union. It also has a strong chemical industry, and its production in this sector now ranks sixth in the world. East Germany is known as the world's largest lignite coal producing country, producing more than 200 million tons of lignite coal last year alone.

    Romania, famous for its oil reserves and production, has increased its oil production from 3.9 million tons in 1947 to more than 10.92 million tons in 1956, second only to the Soviet Union in Europe. Romania's machinery manufacturing industry and chemical industry are developing rapidly. The products produced by these two sectors can now not only meet domestic needs but also be exported abroad. Bulgaria's coal production now ranks first among the Balkan countries, and its per capita electricity production ranks first among the Balkan countries.

    Last year, the seven European People's Democratic countries produced a total of 80 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity (3.3 times the pre-war level), 417 million tons of coal (2.2 times the pre-war level), and 15 million tons of steel (2.5 times the pre-war level). In the same year, the countries of the entire socialist camp produced 293.5 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity (accounting for 17.4% of the world's total), 970 million tons of coal (accounting for 37.8% of the world's total), and 68.22 million tons of steel (accounting for 24.5% of the world's total).

    With the exception of Czechoslovakia and East Germany, the European People's Democratic countries were industrially underdeveloped before the war, and most of them were backward agricultural countries. Now, Poland and Hungary have developed into industrial countries, and Romania and Bulgaria have become industrial-agricultural countries. Albania has also developed into an agricultural-industrial country, and its industrial production has accounted for more than 44% of the entire national economy.

    In order to further and rapidly develop industry, Poland, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Romania, and Albania are currently implementing new five-year plans that began in 1956. According to the plan, the industrial production of these countries will increase by approximately 50% to more than 90% in five years. Bulgaria's second five-year plan will end this year. Summary materials for the past four years and eleven months show that the industrial production tasks of this five-year plan are likely to be overfulfilled by 14%, and the overfulfilled portion alone is equivalent to 60% of the total pre-war industrial output value. The implementation of this five-year plan will increase Bulgaria's industrial production this year by 74% compared to 1952.

    欧洲兄弟国家在和平竞赛中前进
    捷克斯洛伐克轧钢设备水平同美国相等，波兰煤产量比法国多两倍，民主德国是世界最大褐煤生产国家，罗马尼亚石油产量居欧洲第二位，保加利亚煤和电力都居巴尔干第一位……。
    新华社20日讯  欧洲各人民民主国家的工业生产在蓬勃发展。
    目前，捷克斯洛伐克输出的机床数量相当于所有资本主义国家机床输出总量的十分之一。捷克斯洛伐克现在的硬煤产量居欧洲第七位和世界第十二位，钢居欧洲第八位和世界第十位。按人口平均计算，捷克斯洛伐克生产的电力超过了法国和意大利，轧钢设备达到了和美国同等的水平，机器脚踏车、洗衣机都占世界第一位。
    同欧洲资本主义国家相比，波兰和民主德国的工业产量都仅次于英国、法国和西德。去年波兰生产的煤约比法国多两倍。波兰的机器产量已经超过意大利一倍。按人口平均计算，波兰的工业品生产超过了法国。由于机器制造业的巨大发展，民主德国现在是社会主义国家中仅次于苏联的机器制造和出口量最大的国家。它还拥有强大的化学工业，这个部门的生产现在居世界第六位。民主德国被称为世界上最大的褐煤生产国家，单在去年一年中就生产了两亿多吨褐煤。
    以石油蕴藏和生产著名的罗马尼亚的石油产量，已经从1947年的三百九十万吨增加到1956年的一千零九十二万多吨，仅次于苏联而居欧洲第二位。罗马尼亚的机器制造工业和化学工业正在迅速发展中。现在这两个部门所生产的产品，不仅能够满足本国需要，而且还向国外输出。保加利亚的煤产量现在已经居于巴尔干半岛各国的前列，按人口平均的电力生产居巴尔干半岛国家的第一位。
    欧洲七个人民民主国家去年总共生产了八百亿度电力（为战前的三点三倍）、四亿一千七百万吨煤（为战前的二点二倍）、一千五百万吨钢（为战前的二点五倍）。同一年，整个社会主义阵营各国生产的电力是二千九百三十五亿度（占全世界的17.4％）、煤是九亿七千万吨（占全世界的37.8％）、钢是六千八百二十万吨（占全世界的24.5％）。
    欧洲各人民民主国家除捷克斯洛伐克和民主德国外，战前工业都不发达，其中多数是落后的农业国。现在，波兰和匈牙利已经发展成为工业国，罗马尼亚和保加利亚已经成为工业—农业国。阿尔巴尼亚也已经发展成为农业—工业国，它的工业生产已经占整个国民经济的44％以上。
    为了进一步迅速地发展工业，波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、民主德国、罗马尼亚、阿尔巴尼亚目前都正在执行着从1956年开始的新五年计划。根据计划规定，这些国家的工业生产在五年中将增加约50％到90％多。保加利亚的第二个五年计划将在今年结束。已往四年零十一个月的总结材料表明，这个五年计划的工业生产任务有可能超额14％完成，单是超额的部分就相当于战前工业总产值的60％。这个五年计划执行的结果将使保加利亚今年的工业生产比1952年增加74％。
