Integrating Teaching with Production Practice
Northwest Agricultural College Strives to Support Agricultural Cooperatives

Editor's Note: A major direction for improving agricultural production is to increase yield per unit area. This requires rapidly improving farmers' production skills and enabling them to gradually master agricultural science knowledge.

Strengthening the management of agricultural economy is also a major factor in promoting agricultural production. Because now it is no longer an individual economy of a few acres, but a collective economy of several thousand or tens of thousands of acres per commune, and a collective economy with diversified operations in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries. The management of this collective agricultural economy also requires farmers to master scientific management knowledge.

Northwest Agricultural College has assisted some agricultural cooperatives in these two aspects. This is a major support from agricultural schools to agricultural production. There are twenty-seven agricultural colleges and more than one hundred intermediate agricultural schools in the country. If every agricultural college and agricultural school supports agricultural cooperatives like Northwest Agricultural College, they will make a significant contribution to improving China's agricultural production.

The friendship that Northwest Agricultural College has begun to establish with agricultural cooperatives is not only beneficial to the agricultural cooperatives. It is also of great significance for how the teaching and research work of agricultural colleges can be more closely linked to practice, and for how the teachers and students of agricultural colleges can go deep into practice to transform themselves.

(Our newspaper's dispatch from Xi'an) Northwest Agricultural College closely integrates its teaching and scientific research with the production practice of agricultural cooperatives, which has improved the quality of teaching and scientific research, played a significant role in the ideological transformation of teachers and students, and at the same time, helped agricultural cooperatives improve their management, increase the level of cultivation technology, and increase their income.

Northwest Agricultural College has adopted measures such as holding agricultural technology training classes, helping agricultural cooperatives with production planning, conducting high-yield experimental fields, or sending professors and students to live in agricultural cooperatives to specifically help improve cultivation techniques, to meet the requirements of agricultural cooperatives near the school and some key communes in Shaanxi Province, so that they gradually master scientific production techniques. Professor Su Xianzong of the Agronomy Department took advantage of his refresher course in 1955 to live in the Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative in Liquan County for six months, helping to summarize the experience of high-yield corn and improve the technology of planting cotton. The members often said, "Without the help of the Agricultural College, our corn and cotton would not have increased production so much." Recently, Northwest Agricultural College sent Professor Su Xianzong to the Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative again to preliminarily discuss ways to establish close ties: the Agricultural College will help the Fenghuo Cooperative study how to improve management, help the agricultural cooperative formulate next year's plan and long-term plan. The agricultural cooperative will send a group to the Agricultural College to study, and the Agricultural College will help them summarize high-yield experiences. The Fenghuo Cooperative also hopes that Northwest Agricultural College will send people to live in the commune for a long time to guide production and teach commune cadres some basic agricultural science knowledge; it hopes that students from Northwest Agricultural College can intern or cadres can be sent down to their commune, and welcomes cadres and students from Northwest Agricultural College to settle down there for a long time.

During the high tide of agricultural cooperation in the winter of 1955, Northwest Agricultural College organized a working group to support agricultural cooperation, mobilizing teachers from thirteen teaching and research groups and some students to help the Qianjin No. 1 Cooperative in Wugong County formulate a production plan for 1956 to 1958. The Fruit Tree Teaching and Research Group used the school's seedlings to help the agricultural cooperative plant more than 400 apple and pear trees, and specifically taught the members pruning and fertilization techniques. The Vegetable Teaching and Research Group specifically taught the members vegetable planting techniques (this commune had never grown vegetables before). The Crop Cultivation Teaching and Research Group also often went to the commune to teach cultivation techniques. With the specific help of Northwest Agricultural College, the Qianjin No. 1 Cooperative has diversified its operations, its capital turnover has become more flexible, and its income has also increased compared to the past. For example, from January to September this year, the 30 mu of vegetable land alone generated an income of more than 3,000 yuan, which is two or three times more than planting wheat or corn. In terms of field crops, the harvest has also increased significantly. For example, in 1955, the average yield of dry land cotton per mu was more than 30 jin, last year it was 60 jin, and this year it has reached more than 80 jin.

The teachers of Northwest Agricultural College run training classes and correspondence classes to train cadres for agricultural cooperatives and agricultural leading departments. They designed an easy-to-learn, easy-to-understand, simplified and easy-to-use bookkeeping system and trained accountants. Since 1954, Professor Wang Liwo has been working on the professional bookkeeping of agricultural cooperatives. After trials and repeated revisions in agricultural cooperatives such as Qianjin No. 1 Cooperative and Xinnong No. 1 Cooperative, it has now been finalized and promoted in all agricultural cooperatives in Wugong County. While formulating the bookkeeping system for agricultural cooperatives, Northwest Agricultural College has held four or five agricultural cooperative accounting training classes, teaching the methods of using this bookkeeping system and basic accounting and statistical work knowledge to the accountants of all agricultural cooperatives in Wugong County.

The teachers and students of Northwest Agricultural College not only helped agricultural cooperatives improve their cultivation techniques and management level, but also learned rich production experience and the fine style of hard work and simplicity from the peasants. After Professor Su Xianzong helped the Fenghuo Cooperative summarize the experience of high-yield corn, he wrote a long paper of ten thousand words, "Preliminary Report on the Research on High-Yield Cultivation Techniques of Watered Land Double Cropping Corn in Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative," which put forward many new insights on how to increase corn yield. After strengthening their ties with agricultural cooperatives, many students linked the knowledge they learned from books with the production of agricultural cooperatives, which also consolidated their classroom knowledge and improved the quality of their studies.

In order to establish closer ties with agricultural cooperatives, Northwest Agricultural College has decided to select more key communes in different regions within Shaanxi Province to establish relatively close ties. Northwest Agricultural College will provide these communes with more regular technical guidance, and send teachers and students to the communes to conduct scientific experiments and internships. Recently, Northwest Agricultural College approved 265 sophomores and juniors to participate in production in more than 20 agricultural cooperatives in the mountainous areas of northern and southern Shaanxi, and then return to school to continue their studies after one year. Accompanying these students to work in the mountainous areas are also 30 lecturers, teaching assistants, and cadres. (Li Qian)

    教学工作同生产实践相结合
    西北农学院努力支援农业社
    编者按：提高农业生产的一个主要方向，就是提高单位面积产量。这就需要迅速提高农民的生产技术水平，让农民逐渐掌握农业科学知识。
    加强农业经济的经营管理，也是促进农业生产的重大因素。因为现在已经不是一家几亩地的个体经济，而是一社几千几万亩土地的集体经济，而是农林牧副业多种经营的集体经济。对这种集体的农业经济的管理，也需要农民掌握科学的管理知识。
    西北农学院在这两方面对一些农业社进行了帮助。这是农业学校对农业生产的重大支援。全国有二十七个农业学院，有一百多个中级农业学校，如果每一个农学院和农业学校都像西北农学院这样来支援农业社，那么，他们对提高我国农业生产将会作出巨大的贡献。
    西北农学院和农业社开始建立的这种友谊，不只是对农业社有利。就是对于农学院的教学和研究工作如何更密切地联系实际，对于农学院师生如何深入实际改造自己，也都有很大的意义。
    本报西安讯　西北农学院的教学工作和科学研究工作和农业社的生产实践密切地结合，提高了教学和科学研究的质量，对教师和学生的思想改造起了很大作用，同时，还帮助农业社改善了经营管理，提高了耕作技术水平，增加了收入。
    西北农学院采取了举办农业技术训练班，帮助农业社搞生产规划、搞丰产试验田，或派教授和学生住到农业社具体帮助改进耕作技术等办法，满足学校附近的农业社和陕西省的一些重点社的要求，使他们逐渐掌握科学的生产技术。农学系苏献忠教授在1955年利用进修的机会在醴泉县烽火农业社住了六个月，帮助总结玉米丰产经验和改进种植棉花的技术。社员们经常说，“不是农学院的帮助，咱们的玉米和棉花那能增产这样多。”最近，西北农学院又派苏献忠教授到烽火农业社去，初步商定密切联系的办法：农学院帮助烽火社研究如何改善经营管理，帮助农业社制定明年规划和长远规划。农业社派小组到农学院去学习，农学院帮助他们总结丰产经验。烽火社还希望西北农学院派人长期住在社里，指导生产，并且教给社干部一些基本的农业科学知识；希望西北农学院学生实习或下放干部可到他们社里去，并且欢迎西北农学院的干部和学生长期在那里安家落户。
    在1955年冬季农业合作化高潮中，西北农学院组织了支援农业合作化工作组，动员了十三个教研组的教师和一部分学生帮助武功县前进一社制定1956年至1958年的生产规划。果树教研组利用学校的树苗帮助农业社栽种了四百多棵苹果树和梨树，并且具体教给社员整枝、施肥技术，蔬菜教研组具体把蔬菜种植技术教给社员们（这个社过去没种过菜），作物栽培教研组也常到社里传授栽培技术。前进一社在西北农学院的具体帮助下，经营多样化了，资金周转灵活了，收入也比过去增多了。例如他们今年1至9月份，仅三十亩地蔬菜就收入三千多元，比种植小麦或玉米多收入二、三倍。在大田作物方面，收获量也有显著增加。如1955年每亩旱地棉花平均产量是三十多斤，去年是六十斤，今年已达到八十多斤。
    西北农学院的教师们开办训练班、函授班为农业社和农业领导部门培养干部。他们设计一种易学易懂、简化易用的簿记，训练会计员。从1954年以来，王立我教授就着手研究农业社专业簿记，经过在前进一社和西农一社等农业社的试验和多次修改，现在已经定案并在武功全县的农业社推广了。在制定农业社簿记的同时，西北农学院曾举办了四、五次农业社会计训练班，把使用这种簿记的方法和基本会计、统计工作知识教授给武功县所有农业社的会计。
    西北农学院的师生不仅帮助农业社提高了耕作技术和管理水平，也向农民学习了丰富的生产经验和勤劳朴实的优良作风。苏献忠教授帮助烽火社总结玉米丰产经验回来后，写了一篇长达万言的“对烽火农业社水地回茬玉米丰产栽培技术研究的初步报告”论文，对如何提高玉米产量提出不少新的见解。很多学生在加强和农业社的联系后，把书本上学到的知识和农业社的生产联系起来，也巩固了课堂知识，提高了学习质量。
    为了更密切地和农业社联系，西北农学院已经决定在陕西省内分别不同地区选择更多的重点社，建立比较密切的联系，西北农学院对这些社进行比较经常的技术指导，并且派教师和学生到社里进行科学试验和实习。最近，西北农学院又批准二、三年级的学生二百六十五人，分别到陕北陕南山区的二十多个农业社参加生产，一年后再回校继续学习。同这些同学一起去山区劳动的，还有讲师、助教和干部三十人。　　　（李茜）
