Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The "Liu Jiemei's Past and Present Life Contrast Exhibition" began its pre-exhibition at the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace on the 3rd and will officially open on the 6th.

The exhibition is divided into three parts. The first part displays Liu Jiemei's clothing, utensils, and other physical objects from two different periods of his life, before and after liberation, as well as photos and charts reflecting his transformation from being liberated, forgetting his roots, to ideological change. The second part uses physical objects and pictures to showcase the situation of the large-scale airing of views, debates, and major achievements in the rural areas of Beijing's suburbs, as well as the new atmosphere that has emerged in the rural areas of the suburbs after the socialist education movement. The third part uses many photos and charts to illustrate the leap in agricultural production across the country since cooperativization, the significant rise in the living standards of farmers, the brilliant achievements of the first Five-Year Plan in agricultural production and construction, and the bright prospects after the realization of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft).

During the official exhibition period, cadres and masses from central and Beijing municipal government agencies, military units, schools, and rural areas in the suburbs will be organized to visit and study. Liu Jiemei, who has already arrived in Beijing, will also report on his ideological experiences to the visiting masses. The exhibition will also screen the film "Liu Jiemei Repents and Returns" for the visiting masses.

Liu Jiemei is the station director of the Agricultural Technology Guidance Station in Macaomiao Township, Huanggang County, Hubei Province, and a member of the Communist Party. Due to the existence of serious ideas of forgetting his roots and backsliding, during the large-scale airing of views this year, he made a number of erroneous statements attacking the Party, attacking cooperativization, and the policy of unified purchase and sales. After debate and education, he expressed his determination to thoroughly correct his past mistakes and forever follow the Communist Party on the road to socialism.

    刘介梅是湖北省黄岗县马曹庙乡农业技术指导站站长，共产党员，由于存在严重的忘本退坡思想，在今年大鸣大放期间，曾发表了不少攻击党、攻击合作化和统购统销政策的错误言论。经过辩论和教育，他表示要痛改前非，永远跟着共产党走社会主义的道路。
