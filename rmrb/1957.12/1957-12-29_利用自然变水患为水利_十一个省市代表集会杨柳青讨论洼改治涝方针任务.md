Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Representatives from eleven provinces and cities gathered in Yangliuqing, Hebei Province, Tianjin Special District, for a conference on transforming low-lying areas and controlling floods, jointly convened by the Ministry of Water Conservancy and the Ministry of Agriculture, which opened on the 26th. The main purpose of this conference is to exchange experiences in transforming low-lying areas and controlling floods, and to formulate guiding principles, tasks, and long-term plans for future work in this area.

He Jifeng, Vice Minister of Water Conservancy, said at the meeting: The North China Plain and the Songliao Plain are China's main areas prone to waterlogging. In normal years, the area affected by waterlogging exceeds 95 million mu, accounting for 92% of the country's flood-prone areas. Waterlogging has become a serious threat to agricultural production, leading to instability and low yields. Therefore, it is essential to vigorously promote the transformation of low-lying areas and flood control in these regions, turning low-yielding land into high-yielding land and achieving a great leap forward in agricultural production. He said that since liberation, especially after the realization of agricultural cooperation in 1956, significant achievements have been made in transforming low-lying areas and controlling floods, thanks to the attention of party and government leaders at all levels and the efforts of the broad masses of cadres and people. Many typical examples have been created, and rich experience has been accumulated. The movement to transform low-lying areas and control floods has now expanded from the activities of individual townships and cooperatives to entire counties, special districts, and even river basins, developing on an increasingly larger scale and ushering in a new high tide. The current problems are: insufficient understanding of the severity and complexity of waterlogging in some areas; inadequate understanding of the need to understand natural laws, utilize nature, transform nature, and turn water calamities into water conservancy; and neglect of the role of changing cropping systems and planting adaptable crops in flood control. Secondly, there is still doubt about the principle of combining storage and drainage, with emphasis on storage, with some regions believing that flood control mainly relies on drainage. There is also an emphasis on large-scale projects and a neglect of small-scale projects, an emphasis on key areas and a neglect of overall areas. Some projects lack overall planning and comprehensive consideration, with inconsistent requirements and uncoordinated steps between upstream and downstream areas, increasing contradictions and causing losses to production. These biases must be corrected as soon as possible. When discussing future work in transforming low-lying areas and controlling floods, He Jifeng proposed the following three major tasks: (1) Vigorously carry out engineering construction for transforming low-lying areas and controlling floods, and improve flood control capabilities, requiring the basic elimination of ordinary floods within ten years; (2) Increase the area of rice cultivation. In northern regions, the area of paddy fields needs to be expanded by 130 million to 150 million mu within ten years. The Hai River basin and the Shandong Peninsula should also actively develop rice cultivation in low-lying, waterlogged, and saline-alkali areas, depending on the availability of water sources; (3) Improve the soil. The 96 million mu of low-lying land in Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui, the 17 million mu of saline-alkali land in the four provinces of Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, the more than 190 million mu of grassland swamps in the Northeast region, and the more than 17 million mu of saline-alkali wasteland along the coast of Bohai Sea and northern Jiangsu should all be actively improved and utilized.

More than 200 people, including responsible persons from agricultural and forestry and water conservancy departments of relevant special districts and counties in the nine provinces of Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Liaoning, as well as Beijing and Tianjin, participated in the meeting.

    利用自然变水患为水利
    十一个省市代表集会杨柳青讨论洼改治涝方针任务
    据新华社讯　中央水利部和农业部联合召开的十一个省市洼改治涝会议26日在河北省天津专区驻地杨柳青开幕。这次会议主要交流洼改治涝经验，制定今后洼改治涝的方针、任务和长远规划。
    水利部副部长何基沣在会上讲话说：华北平原和松辽平原，是我国主要的涝灾地区，一般年份受涝面积九千五百多万亩，占全国易涝面积的92％，涝灾成为农业生产的严重威胁，生产不稳定，而且产量低，因此，在这些地区必需大力开展洼改治涝运动，变低产为高产，实现农业生产大跃进。他说：解放以后特别是从1956年实现农业合作化后，由于各地党政领导的重视和广大干部群众的努力，洼改治涝工作已取得了很大成绩，创造了许多典型、积累了丰富的经验，洼改治涝运动目前已由一乡一社的活动推向一个县、一个专区以至一个流域，发展规模越来越大，出现了新的高潮。现阶段的问题是：有些地区对内涝灾害的严重性和复杂性认识不足；对于摸清自然规律，利用自然、改造自然、变水患为水利体会不够；忽视改变耕作制度，改种适应性作物等农业措施在治涝上的作用。其次，认为治涝主要依靠排水，对蓄泄兼施、以蓄为主的方针还有怀疑；重大型轻小型，重点轻面，有的工程缺乏全面规划、通盘考虑，上下游要求不一致，步调不统一，增加了矛盾，给生产带来损失。这些偏向必须及早纠正。在谈到今后洼改、治涝工作时，何基沣提出以下三大任务：（一）大力进行洼改、治涝的工程建设，提高防涝能力，要求在十年内基本消灭普通涝灾；（二）增加稻谷种植面积，在北方地区，十年内需扩大水田一亿三千万到一亿五千万亩，海河流域和山东半岛地区，也应该根据水源可能，在洼涝盐碱地区积极发展水稻；（三）改良土壤。晋、冀、鲁、豫和苏北、皖北的九千六百万亩低洼地和晋、冀、鲁、豫四省的一千七百万亩盐碱地、东北地区的一万九千多万亩草原沼泽地，以及渤海沿岸苏北沿海的一千七百多万亩盐碱荒地，都要积极加以改良利用。
    参加这次会议的有河北、河南、山东、山西、安徽、江苏、吉林、黑龙江、辽宁九个省有关专区、县和北京、天津两市的农林、水利部门负责人二百多人。
