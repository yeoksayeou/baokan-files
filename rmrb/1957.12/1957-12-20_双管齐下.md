Notes

    "Playing Two Tracks at Once"
    At the Paris conference, a so-called "playing two tracks at once" policy emerged. According to explanations from American and British news agencies, "playing two tracks at once" means: on one hand, exploring the possibility of negotiations with the Soviet Union, and on the other hand, intensifying the implementation of nuclear arms race plans.
    Why "play two tracks at once"? This is because the arms expansion and war preparation plan prepared by the United States for this conference has encountered unexpected resistance, and at the same time, the pressure to negotiate with the Soviet Union is too great. In order to ease this resistance and pressure, the so-called "playing two tracks at once" policy was put forward to induce Western European countries to swallow the poison of intensified nuclear arms race prepared for them by the United States.
    "Playing two tracks at once" is actually playing one track alone, that is, under the guise of exploring the possibility of negotiations with the Soviet Union, to continue to promote the policy of arms expansion and war preparation. However, this is a road that will not work. Because no matter whether it is using "playing two tracks at once" or other methods, it cannot conceal or save the complete bankruptcy and failure of the American "policy of strength."

    “双管齐下”
    在巴黎会议上，出现了一种所谓“双管齐下”的政策。据美英通讯社的解释，所谓“双管齐下”就是：一面探讨同苏联谈判的可能性，一面加紧推行核军备竞赛的计划。
    为什么要“双管齐下”呢？这是因为美国为这个会议所准备的扩军备战计划遭到了意想不到的抗拒，同时要求同苏联谈判的压力太大了。为了缓和这种抗拒和压力，于是就提出了所谓“双管齐下”的政策，来诱使西欧国家吞下美国为它们所准备的加紧核军备竞赛的毒药。
    “双管齐下”实际上是一管独下，即在所谓探讨同苏联谈判的可能性的掩盖下，来继续推行扩军备战的政策。但是，这已是走不通的道路了。因为不管是用“双管齐下”或者是其他的手法，都掩饰不住、也挽救不了美国“实力政策”的彻底破产和失败。
