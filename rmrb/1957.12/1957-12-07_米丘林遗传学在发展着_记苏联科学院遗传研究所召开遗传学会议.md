Michurin Genetics is Developing
　  —On the Genetics Conference Held by the Institute of Genetics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences
    Li Jigeng
    To commemorate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, the Institute of Genetics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences held a conference in Moscow from October 8th to 12th on the heritability and variability of animals, plants, and microorganisms.
    Since the world-renowned August 1948 All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences conference, this conference was the first nationwide genetics discussion meeting. Participants included: the famous geneticists Lysenko, Nuzhdin, Grushchenko, Dolgushin, Plesent, Isaev, Kushner, Feginson; experts on individual development Razumov, Novikov, Kupielman; the famous plant fertilization problem experts Polenkov, Metvejeva; cytologists Kostriukova, Maklov; the famous breeders Yurev, Piselev, Kuchumov; wheat classification expert Yakubzener; wheat-Agropyron hybrids breeder Lapchenko; plant physiologists Ginjer, Rubin; microbiologists Gimokov, Molomchev, Krasilnikov; virologists Sikov, Zhdanov; animal husbandry experts Vasenke, Psenichnai, etc. About two hundred academic reports were presented at the meeting. These reports collectively reflected the latest achievements of Michurin genetics in solving many theoretical and practical problems of great significance in the short period of nine years. At the same time, from the literature cited in many reports, it can also be seen that this advanced biological science has had a huge and far-reaching impact on other countries around the world, whether socialist or capitalist.
    The first report on the first day of the conference was Nuzhdin's "On the Current Situation of the 'Carriers' of Hereditary Material." In addition to briefly and clearly pointing out the basic differences between the two directions in genetics—the Michurin direction and the Mendel-Morgan direction—on this issue, the report also emphasized that the chromosomal theory of heredity and gene theory are incorrect, and even proven by the experimental results obtained by Morganian geneticists themselves (such as position effects); conversely, more and more experimental results prove that the basic principles of Michurin genetics are correct and can withstand the test of practice.
    Denying the possibility of obtaining asexual hybrids has always been an argument used by Morganian geneticists against Michurin genetics. Grushchenko, in his report entitled "The Development of Asexual Hybrid Work," refuted some of the experimental basis recently put forward by opponents, especially mentioning the work of Stup and Bimo in Germany. According to Grushchenko's report, Stup and Bimo both obtained real asexual hybrids in their experiments, but they avoided talking about it and publicly declared: they did not confirm Lysenko's work. Grushchenko's report cited a large number of facts about asexual hybrids obtained by scientists in the United States, Britain, France, China, Japan, and other countries, and further demonstrated the achievements and significance of this method in breeding practice. His report greatly helped people understand the nature of the controversy on this issue.
    The issue of stages in plant individual development occupied a considerable proportion in this meeting. The research on this issue has been inextricably linked to the development of Michurin genetics from the beginning. The reports in this area included: Razumov's "The Current Situation of Vernalization Research"; Novikov's "The Acquisition of New Plant Traits When Changing Photoperiod Conditions in the Third Stage"; Kupielman's "The Basic Laws of Plant Individual Development from the Perspective of Stage Development Theory"; Plesent's "On the Contact Nature of Plant Development Stages," and others. Particularly worth mentioning is Razumov's report, which not only specifically refuted the views of some opponents but also pointed out the tasks for future research in this area.
    In animal genetics, Kushner's report "Improving the Heterosis Effect Applied to Livestock Breeding" was of great significance. He pointed out that the correct selection of parent breeding stock has a direct impact on the size of heterosis in offspring, and suggested using recurrent backcrossing methods to fix this advantage in offspring. In addition, Psenichnai reported on the role of feed in the individual development of livestock; Vasenke demonstrated the control of heredity in livestock, etc.
    Reports in microbial and viral genetics included: Gimokov's "Several Laws of Variability of Pathogenic Microorganisms"; Murachev's "The Current Situation of the Problem of Microbial Variability"; Krasilnikov's "Variability of Microorganisms Under the Influence of External Factors"; Sikov's "The Problem of Viral Genetics," and others.
    On the last day of the meeting, Academician Lysenko gave a report entitled "On the Laws of Life of Biological Species and Its Significance for Practice." Based on rich experimental observation materials, Academician Lysenko once again comprehensively demonstrated the species and species formation, the relationship between individuals within and between different species, and refuted the criticisms of his opponents in this regard one by one. After the meeting, the participants also visited Academician Lysenko's experiments on this issue.
    The conference was of great significance in summarizing and developing Michurin genetics. This conference fully demonstrated that genetics, as an important component of Michurin biology, is developing effectively.

　　米丘林遗传学在发展着
　  ——记苏联科学院遗传研究所召开遗传学会议
    李继耕
    苏联科学院遗传研究所为了纪念十月革命四十周年，10月8日到12日在莫斯科召开了关于动物、植物以及微生物的遗传性和变异性的会议。
    自从举世闻名的1948年8月全苏列宁农业科学院会议以来，这次会议是第一次全苏性的遗传学讨论会。参加会议的人包括：著名的遗传学家李森科，努日金，格鲁森科，多尔古森，普列森特，伊塞也夫，库什聂尔，费金逊；个体发育问题专家拉祖莫夫，诺维科夫，库彼尔曼；著名的植物受精问题专家波连科夫，梅特外捷娃；细胞学家考斯特留克娃，马克洛夫；著名的选种家尤列夫，皮塞列夫，库丘莫夫；小麦分类专家雅库波曾聂尔；小麦—鹅冠草杂种的培育者拉普琴科；植物生理学家金杰里，鲁宾；微生物学家吉莫科夫，莫洛姆切夫，克拉西尔尼科夫；病毒学家西霍夫，日丹纳夫；畜牧学家瓦先克赫，普森尼契奈等。会上共提出学术报告约二百篇。这些报告集中地反映了在短短九年里米丘林遗传学在从事解决许多具有重大理论和实践意义的问题当中所获得的最新成就。同时从许多报告所引用的文献里，也可以看出这一先进生物科学对世界其他各国，不论是社会主义国家，还是资本主义国家，所发生的巨大而深远的影响。
    第一天会议的第一个报告是努日金的“关于遗传性‘物质的携带者’问题的现状”。报告中除扼要而明确地指出遗传学中两个方向——米丘林方向和孟德尔、摩尔根方向对这一问题的基本分歧以外，还强调说明遗传性的染色体理论和基因理论的不正确，甚至也被摩尔根派遗传学家自己所获得的实验结果（如位置效应）所证明；相反地，愈来愈多的实验结果证明米丘林遗传学的基本原理是正确的，经得起实践考验的。
    否认无性杂种获得的可能性，一直是摩尔根派遗传学家反对米丘林遗传学的一个论点。格鲁森科在以“无性杂种工作的发展”为题的报告中，批驳了反对者们最近提出的一些试验根据，其中特别提到德国的斯图普和比莫的工作。根据格鲁森科的报告，斯图普和比莫都在自己的试验中得到了真正的无性杂种，他们却避而不谈，反公开宣称：他们没有证实李森科的工作。在格鲁森科的报告中引证了美国、英国、法国、中国、日本等国许多科学家们所获得的大量关于无性杂种的事实，并且进而论证了这一方法在选种实践中所取得的成就和意义。他的报告使人们对这一问题争论的性质的了解，有很大帮助。
    植物个体发育中的阶段性问题，在这次会议中占有相当大的比重。这一问题的研究，对米丘林遗传学的发展，从一开始就有着不可分割的联系。在这方面提出报告的有：拉祖莫夫的“春化作用研究的现状”；诺维科夫的“在第三阶段改变光周期条件时植物新性状的获得”；库彼尔曼的“从阶段发育理论角度看植物个体发育的基本规律”；普列森特的“论植物发育阶段的联系性质”等。特别值得提起的是拉祖莫夫的报告，他不仅具体地驳斥了某些反对者的观点，而且还指出在这一方面今后研究的任务。
    动物遗传方面库什聂尔的报告“应用于家畜饲养中的杂种优势效果的提高”具有很大意义。他指出正确地选择亲本种畜，对于后代杂种优势的大小有直接的影响，并且建议用轮回杂交方法在后代固定这一优势。此外，普森尼契奈报告了饲料在家畜个体发育中的作用；瓦先克赫论证了关于家畜遗传性的控制等。
    在微生物和病毒遗传方面提出报告的有：吉莫科夫的“病原微生物变异性的几个规律”；穆拉切夫的“微生物变异性问题的现状”，克拉西尔尼科夫的“微生物在外界作用影响下的变异性”；西霍夫的“病毒遗传问题”等。
    会议的最后一天，李森科院士作了题为“论生物种的生活规律和它对实践的意义”的报告。根据丰富的实验观察材料，李森科院士再一次全面地论证了种和种的形成，种内和不同种个体间的相互关系，并且一一反驳了反对者在这方面对他的批评。会后，参加会议的人们还实地参观了李森科院士就这一问题所进行的试验。
    会议在总结和发展米丘林遗传学方面具有重要的意义。这次会议充分显示：作为米丘林生物学重要组成部分的遗传学，正在具有成效地发展着。
