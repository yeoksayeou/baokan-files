　　Why People Eat More in Winter Than in Summer
　　Chen Xuecun
    We all have this experience: we eat more in winter than in summer. Is this phenomenon normal?
    We know that in order to live and work, a person needs heat—the power to work. This heat energy is produced by food undergoing chemical changes in the body. How much heat energy each person needs daily depends on factors such as body size, age, gender, nature of work, and climate. Generally speaking, a strong adult male engaged in light labor needs 2,400 kilocalories of heat energy per day.
    The body's heat energy consumption can be divided into two parts: one part is the basic heat energy consumption, that is, the heat energy required without being affected by exercise. For example, the heat energy necessary to maintain body temperature, breathing, heartbeat, and other internal organ activities. The other part is the extra heat energy consumption, such as the heat energy required for eating, dressing, singing, writing, and various physical labors. And the heat energy consumed each day is basically equal to what is taken in.
    In winter, in order to adapt to climate change, the human body has the following ways to regulate body temperature: 1. Some extra movements, such as shivering, stomping feet, rubbing hands, and even running; 2. Due to cold stimulation, the activity of certain endocrine glands in the body—the thyroid gland and the adrenal gland—is strengthened, secreting more thyroxine and adrenaline. These endocrine hormones (also known as hormones) can accelerate the body's metabolism; 3. In winter, people wear more clothes, which increases the burden on the body. These can promote the acceleration of metabolism and make the body release more heat energy, so it is necessary to eat more food to supplement the extra heat energy consumed.
    If the heat energy we get from food every day is not enough to supply what is consumed, then the fat and carbohydrates stored in our body tissues and the protein that makes up the body tissues will be consumed to supply the missing heat energy. As a result, the body will gradually become thin and weak, labor productivity will decrease, and ultimately diseases will occur. Therefore, it is normal to eat more in winter.

### 为什么人在冬天比夏天吃得多

　　为什么人在冬天比夏天吃得多
　　陈学存
    我们每个人都有这么一个体会，冬天的饭量比夏天大。这种现象是不是正常呢？
    我们知道，一个人要活着，要工作，就需要热量——工作的力量。这种热能是靠食物在身体内经过化学变化而成的。每人每日需要多少热能，这决定于身体大小、年龄、性别、劳动性质、气候等条件。一般的说，一个壮年男子从事轻劳动者，每天需要二千四百仟卡热能。
    身体热能的消耗，可以分为两部分：一部分是基本的热能消耗，也就是说在不受运动的影响之下所需要消耗的热能。例如维持身体的体温、呼吸、心跳和其他内腑活动所必需的热能。另外一部分是额外热能消耗，例如吃饭、穿衣、唱歌、写字、各种体力劳动等所需要消耗的热能。而每天所消耗的热能，基本上和所摄取的相等。
    冬天，为了适应气候的变化，人的身体就有下列调节体温的办法：一、有些额外的动作，例如战栗、顿脚、擦手、甚至跑步等；二、由于寒冷的刺激，使身体的某些内分泌腺——甲状腺和肾上腺的活动加强，分泌出更多的甲状腺素和肾上腺素，这些内分泌素（又名贺尔蒙）都可以使身体的代谢加快；三、冬天穿的衣着也较多，因此使身体的负担加重。这些都能促进代谢的加快，使热能放散得多，因此也需要吃更多的食物来补充多消耗的热能。
    假若我们每日从食物中得来的热能不够供给所消耗的，那么我们身体组织中所贮存的脂肪与碳水化合物和构成身体组织的蛋白质，就要被消耗来供给所缺少的热能，身体因此就会渐渐的瘦弱，劳动力减低，最终还会发生疾病。所以在冬天多吃一些饭是正常的现象。
