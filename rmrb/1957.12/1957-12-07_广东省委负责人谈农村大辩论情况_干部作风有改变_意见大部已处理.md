Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 5th. The person in charge of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China told reporters on the 3rd that most agricultural cooperatives in the province have been able to pay attention to resolving the urgent and immediately solvable problems raised by members during the rural great debate.

The person in charge of the Provincial Party Committee said that the vast majority of the opinions raised by members of agricultural cooperatives throughout the province during the "blooming and contending" period were basically well-intentioned and constructive. These opinions mainly focused on improving current production management and the style of cadres; a small number of opinions were incorrect. Most agricultural cooperatives first solved the problems in current production management in accordance with the spirit of rectification and reform. According to statistics from 493 cooperatives in five counties of the Huiyang Special Zone in November, 57% of the 24,000 correct opinions raised by members had been adopted. The remaining opinions, which were difficult to implement for the time being, were also explained to the masses. This greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses for speaking out and improved their enthusiasm for production.

The person in charge of the Provincial Party Committee said that the work style of rural cadres has now undergone a more significant change, and they have universally participated in labor. More than 600 of the more than 1,000 cadres above the level of team leader in 82 cooperatives in Heyuan County have gradually corrected their shortcomings after being criticized by members, and have generally gone down to the teams, households, and fields. After deepening their work, they learned from conversations that more than 2,200 households in difficulty needed assistance, so they actively tried to help them solve their difficulties, further strengthening the relationship between cadres and members.

The person in charge of the Provincial Party Committee pointed out that during the rectification, poor and lower-middle peasant members also raised many opinions on the issue of well-to-do middle peasants. This problem has also been rectified relatively well. On the one hand, Heping Agricultural Cooperative in Huiyang County criticized the capitalist ideas of well-to-do middle peasants, encouraged them to run the cooperative well, and resolutely take the socialist road; on the other hand, it also made specific arrangements for some well-to-do middle peasant households whose income had decreased. According to statistics from 1,442 cooperatives in five counties of the Gaoyao Special Zone in mid-November, cooperatives that had resolved or were dealing with issues related to well-to-do middle peasants and some remaining issues in running cooperatives accounted for 74% of the total number of cooperatives.

The person in charge said that recently, during the busy season of autumn harvesting and winter planting, agricultural cooperatives throughout the province have more universally improved labor organization and emphasized the collective management of winter planting. According to the plan of the Guangdong Provincial leading organs, after the winter production and grain purchase work are completed, agricultural cooperatives throughout the province will carry out comprehensive and systematic improvement work after the great debate.

    广东省委负责人谈农村大辩论情况
　　干部作风有改变　意见大部已处理
    据新华社广州5日电　中共广东省委负责人3日对记者说，在农村大辩论中社员提出来的迫切而又可能立刻解决的问题，全省大多数农业社能够注意解决。
    省委负责人说，全省农业社社员鸣放时提出的意见，绝大多数基本上是善意的和建设性的，这些意见主要集中在改善当前生产管理、干部作风等问题上；少数意见是错误的。大多数农业社根据边整边改精神首先解决了当前生产管理中的问题。据11月份惠阳专区五个县四百九十三个社的统计，社员们提出的二万四千条正确意见中已有57％的意见被采纳。其余的意见一时难以办到的，也向群众作了解释。这样做了以后，大大鼓舞群众鸣放的情绪，提高了他们生产积极性。
    省委负责人说，现在农村干部的作风有了较显著的改变，普遍参加了劳动。河源县八十二个社的一千多个组长以上的干部，有六百多人被社员批评后逐步改正了缺点，普遍做到下组下户下田，工作深入以后，从谈心中了解到有二千二百多户困难户需要帮助，就积极设法帮助他们解决了困难，进一步密切了干部和社员间的关系。
    省委负责人指出，整改当中，贫农和下中农社员对富裕中农问题提的意见也是较多的。这个问题也是整改得较好的。惠阳县和平农业社一方面批判富裕中农资本主义的思想，勉励他们好好办社，坚决走社会主义道路；另一方面对减少收入的某些富裕中农户也作了具体安排。据高要专区五个县一千四百四十二个社11月中旬统计，已经解决和正在处理有关富裕中农问题和办社中某些遗留问题的社占总社数的74％。
    负责人说，近来在秋收冬种大忙期间，全省农业社更普遍改进劳动组织，强调冬种的集体经营。按照广东省领导机关的计划，在冬季生产和粮食征购工作告一段落后，全省农业社将在大辩论后进行全面有系统的改进工作。
