    "More" and "Faster" Must Be Realistic and Conform to Reality
    Chen Zhiyan
    Reading the news published on today's edition about the Yuxi Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party leading the development of local industry is very gratifying. In addition to seeing a spirit of active promotion, there are several points worth mentioning. First, it is based on the needs of agriculture and serves agricultural production. Second, it determines what industries to develop based on the natural resource conditions of each county in the region. Third, it is resourceful and thrifty in running enterprises. Because it can achieve these points, the Yuxi area can transform from an industrial "barren land" – with only two 20-kilowatt small generators and ten workers – into a small industrial network with 900 kilowatts of electricity and nearly a hundred factories and mines in two or three years.
    From this news, it seems that Yuxi Prefecture has implemented the policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical." Their approach has reference value for some areas where local industry is not very developed.
    Writing this, I remembered a passage from the editorial "We Must Adhere to the Construction Policy of More, Faster, Better, and More Economical" in this newspaper on the 12th of this month: "...The 'more' and 'faster' that we require are realistic and conform to actual conditions. Blind, subjective 'more' and 'faster' cannot truly achieve the goals of 'more' and 'faster'. That approach will not only fail to effectively promote construction, but will also harm it." The purpose of quoting this passage is, on the one hand, to illustrate that the Yuxi Prefecture has both a revolutionary spirit of promotion and attention to being realistic and conforming to reality in the development of local industry; on the other hand, it also wants to remind us of the opposite situation that has occurred in some places in the past.
    Generally speaking, comrades in local areas are very interested in developing local industry. However, there have been some deviations in some places in the past. Specifically, one is that the target of service is unclear. Instead of focusing on the actual needs of the local people, especially the needs of agriculture, they look at which products sell well in the market and which products have high profits, and then rush to follow suit. As a result, products are often stockpiled or do not solve local problems. The other is that the conditions are unclear. That is, there is insufficient investigation and research into the local resource conditions, and factories are built blindly. As a result, there is insufficient raw materials, or raw materials are purchased from distant places, which makes the cost of the product very high. Furthermore, they are greedy for new and big things, pay attention to ostentation, and are not practical. As a result, limited funds do not accomplish much. To sum up these points, it is said that they violate the spirit of being realistic and conforming to reality, and thus fail to achieve the goals of "more" and "faster."
    Looking back at the Yuxi Prefecture, the situation is different. This is the reason why we want to say a few words here.

### “多”和“快”要实事求是、合乎实际

    “多”和“快”要实事求是、合乎实际
    陈之衍
    读了今天本版发表的中共玉溪地委领导发展地方工业的消息，是很令人高兴的。从中除了看到一种积极的促进的精神以外，还有几点值得提出来。一是根据农业的需要，为农业生产服务；二是根据本区各县自然资源的条件，确定发展些什么工业；三是因陋就简，勤俭办企业。因为能做到这几点，所以玉溪专区就能在两三年以内从一块工业上的“不毛之地”——只有两个二十瓩的小发电机和十个工人，发展到一个拥有九百瓩电力和近百个厂矿的小型工业网。
    从这条新闻看来，玉溪专区贯彻了多、快、好、省的方针。他们的做法对于一些地方工业很不发展的地区是有参考意义的。
    写到这里，想起了本月12日本报的社论“必须坚持多、快、好、省的建设方针”里的一段话：“……我们所要求的多和快，是实事求是的、合乎实际情况的多和快，盲目的主观主义的多和快，并不能真正达到多和快的目的。那种做法，不但不能有效地促进建设事业，反而会给它带来损害”。引这段话的目的，一方面是想说明玉溪专区在发展地方工业中既有革命的促进精神，又注意了实事求是和合乎实际；一方面也想提醒一下过去某些地方出现过相反的情况。
    地方上的同志对于发展本地方的工业，一般说来兴趣还是大的。但过去有些地方有过一些偏向。具体说来，一是服务的对象不明。不是着眼于本地方人民的实际需要，特别是农业的需要，而是看市场上那些产品畅销、那些产品利润大，于是趋之若鹜，其结果往往是产品积压，或者并不解决本地方的问题。另一个是条件不明。这就是对本地的资源条件调查研究不够，盲目建厂，结果是原材料不足，或者从远地购买原材料，使得产品成本很高。再就是贪新贪大、讲求排场、不务实际，结果是有限的资金，没有办多少事情。总括这几点，就是说违背了实事求是和合乎实际的精神。也就达不到多和快的目的。
    反过来看看玉溪专区，情况就不同了。这就是我们想在这里说几句话的原因。
