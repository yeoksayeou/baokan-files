    The archives of the Marx-Lenin Institute in Moscow contain many documents about the participation of Czech and Slovak communists in the October Revolution and their struggle to defend the Soviet regime. Recently, they handed over a party membership card of the famous Czechoslovak writer Jaroslav Hašek, the author of the world-renowned novel "The Good Soldier Švejk," which they had preserved for many years, to the archives department of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. Hašek participated in the struggle to defend the Soviet regime during the Soviet Civil War and joined the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). His party membership card indicates the year 1920.
