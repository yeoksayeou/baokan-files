Xinhua News Agency, 20th, Paris Dispatch: The summit meeting of the heads of government of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization closed on the afternoon of the 19th. The meeting issued a declaration and a communiqué, announcing the establishment of a nuclear weapon stockpile for the North Atlantic Group and the deployment of intermediate-range ballistic missiles to "strengthen" the military "strength" of the North Atlantic Group. These decisions of the meeting show that, despite the firm opposition of the public in various countries, the North Atlantic Group, under the instigation of the United States, is moving towards stepping up preparations for atomic war.

The declaration calls on Western countries to unite and groundlessly insists on the so-called Soviet "threat." The purpose of the declaration is to attempt to rationalize the "Cold War" and arms race policies pursued by the United States.

Under the recent series of peace initiatives by the Soviet Union and the strong pressure from the people of Western countries demanding peace, the declaration had to express its readiness to "resolve international problems through consultation" and "end world tensions." At the same time, however, it emphasized the continued pursuit of the bankrupt policy of "strength," believing that this is "absolutely necessary." The declaration used the "interdependence" argument announced earlier by the United States and Britain, expressing the need to "promote greater consistency and greater strength" among member states.

The communiqué issued by the meeting is divided into six parts: "International Situation," "Work of the Alliance," "Disarmament," "Defense of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization," "Scientific and Technological Cooperation," and "Economic Cooperation."

The meeting communiqué, in its section on the "Defense" of the North Atlantic Group, announced that the group "has decided to establish a reserve of atomic warheads" and equip itself with intermediate-range ballistic missiles, which will be controlled by the American commander of the North Atlantic Group forces.

Information revealed during the meeting indicated that the above decision was made under pressure from the United States. However, it can be seen from the communiqué that, because Western European countries are afraid of establishing missile bases, the extent to which these countries have accepted the US plan remains to be haggled over in the future. The communiqué stated that arrangements for the deployment and use of nuclear warhead stockpiles and missiles in Western Europe will be "made with corresponding decisions in agreement with the countries directly concerned."

The communiqué also announced that the armed forces of the group will be "standardized and unified as highly as possible," especially in "certain aspects of air and sea defense and logistical support, as well as the composition and equipment of troops." The group will hold a ministerial meeting in early 1958 to specifically discuss military issues.

In addition, the communiqué also mentioned that the member states of the North Atlantic Group should coordinate in the research, development, and manufacture of modern weapons, and that they should try to promote the scientific and technological development of the North Atlantic Group countries through "the convergence of scientific equipment and intelligence and the sharing of tasks." A science committee will also be established and a scientist will be appointed as the scientific advisor to the Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Group.

The communiqué did not mention what attitude the member states of the North Atlantic Group would take towards the specific proposals in the Soviet letters, a question that had aroused heated debate during the meeting. The communiqué only stated in the section on disarmament that Western countries are "willing" to negotiate with the Soviet Union on disarmament issues. It demanded that the Soviet Union rejoin the work of the United Nations Disarmament Commission, which has proven to be ineffective, and stated that the West would also agree to "hold a meeting of foreign ministers to resolve the deadlock." At the same time, the communiqué reiterated the West's past claims at the London disarmament talks and the Twelfth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, with particular emphasis on resolving the so-called "supervision" issue first. In order to conceal the West's deliberate attitude of bringing the disarmament talks to a standstill, the communiqué tried its best to shift the responsibility to the Soviet Union. Observers pointed out that the communiqué did so in an attempt to divert world public opinion from the Soviet Union's specific peace proposals.

The communiqué, in its section on the "Work of the Alliance," acknowledged that "further improvements" were still "needed" on the issue of "political consultation," which had been repeatedly insisted upon by many countries in Western Europe. However, the only method it proposed in this regard was to require member states to "frequently and fully inform" the permanent representatives of each country in the group of policies that have a significant impact on the North Atlantic Group countries. In addition, it stipulates that the Council of Permanent Representatives and the Secretary-General of the Group should conduct "effective consultations" and "mediate at an early stage" when necessary.

When discussing the issue of "Economic Cooperation," the communiqué supported the development of the economic group of the six countries of Western Europe (Common Market) and the European "Free Trade Area" plan planned by Britain. At the same time, the communiqué reflected the demands of Western European countries and expressed its support for "expanding international trade by reducing barriers to exchange and trade." The communiqué also promoted the argument that the member states of the North Atlantic Group and other countries in the "free world" are "economically interdependent."

The communiqué announced that the North Atlantic Group must intervene in affairs outside the scope of the group. In this regard, it used words such as "peace," "cooperation," and "concern" for the "economic welfare" of the people of the Middle East to conceal the colonialist and ferocious nature and intentions of this military group, and avoided talking about the fierce infighting among some major colonial countries in the Middle East and Africa. The communiqué also stated that "the friendly historical, economic and other ties between certain European countries and Africa" would make the cooperation between the member states of the North Atlantic Group and African countries and peoples "particularly appropriate and effective," thus supporting the colonial interests and colonial rule of colonial countries such as France in Africa. The communiqué reiterated the North Atlantic Group's support for the Netherlands and its interference in Indonesia's internal affairs. It described the upsurge of Indonesia's anti-Dutch colonial movement as "serious incidents in Indonesia" and expressed "concern for such incidents."

The communiqué repeated the West's habitual trick of using the German issue to poison the international atmosphere. It blamed the Soviet Union for the long delay in Germany's reunification, while reiterating the West's insistence on imposing the West German system on East Germany through so-called "free elections."

Xinhua News Agency, 20th, Paris Dispatch: The supreme meeting of the North Atlantic Group has decided to hold two ministerial meetings next year.

A meeting of the group's defense ministers and major military leaders is scheduled to be held in March next year. It is said that the purpose of this meeting is to draw up the military technical details for the US plan to supply missiles to Europe.

The foreign ministers and defense ministers of the North Atlantic Group countries will meet in May; they will issue detailed instructions on missile "defense" work based on specific recommendations made after the March meeting and the development of the political situation.

    美国使大西洋集团走上核备战道路
    巴黎会议敲着“实力”的破鼓闭幕
    在西欧建立导弹基地问题有待下回分解
    新华社20日讯  巴黎消息：北大西洋集团各国政府首脑会议在19日下午闭幕。会议发表了一个宣言和一个公报，宣布要建立北大西洋集团的核武器储备和配备中程弹道导弹，以“加强”北大西洋集团的军事“实力”。会议的这些决定表明，北大西洋集团不顾各国公众的坚决反对，正在美国的策动下向加紧准备原子战争的道路前进。
    宣言号召西方国家团结一致，并且毫无根据地硬说有所谓苏联“威胁”。宣言的目的是企图使美国所奉行的“冷战”和军备竞赛政策合理化。
    在苏联最近一系列的和平倡议和西方各国人民要求和平的强大压力下，宣言中不得不表示了准备“用协商来解决国际问题”和“结束世界紧张局势”。但在同时，它强调继续奉行破了产的“实力”政策，认为这是“绝对必要的”。宣言搬用了美英两国早先宣布的“互相依赖”的说法，表示要设法在成员国之间“促进更大的一致和更大的实力”。
    会议发表的公报分为“国际局势”、“联盟的工作”、“裁军”、“北大西洋公约组织的防务”、“科学和技术合作”以及“经济合作”等六个部分。
    会议公报在谈到北大西洋集团的“防务”的部分宣布，这个集团“已经决定建立原子核弹头的储备”和配备中程弹道导弹，这些导弹将由美国籍的北大西洋集团军队总司令掌握。
    会议期间透露出来的消息表明，上述决定是在美国的压力下作出的。但是，从公报里可以看出，由于西欧国家害怕设立导弹基地，这些国家对美国的计划接受到什么程度，还有待于今后的讨价还价。公报说，在西欧的核弹头储备库和导弹的部署及使用上的安排，将“在同直接有关国家取得协议的情况下作出相应的决定”。
    公报还宣布，将使这个集团的武装部队“尽可能高度地标准化和统一”，特别是在“空、海防御和后勤支援以及部队的组成和装备等的某些方面”。这个集团将在1958年年初举行一次部长级会议来专门讨论军事问题。
    此外，公报还谈到北大西洋集团各成员国要在现代化武器的研究、发展和制造方面进行配合，要设法通过“科学设备和情报的汇合以及分担任务”的办法来促进北大西洋集团国家的科学、技术的发展，还将成立一个科学委员会和任命一个科学家充当北大西洋集团秘书长的科学顾问。
    公报没有提到北大西洋集团成员国对苏联信件中的具体建议采取什么态度，而这个问题是会议期间曾经引起热烈争论的。公报只是在关于裁军的部分表示，西方国家“愿意”就裁军问题同苏联谈判。它要求苏联重新参加已经证明是无效的联合国裁军委员会的工作，并且表示西方也将同意“举行外交部长级会议来解决僵局”。同时，公报重申西方过去在伦敦裁军谈判和联合国大会第十二届会议上提出的主张，其中特别强调要先解决所谓“监督”问题。为了掩饰西方故意使裁军谈判陷于僵局的态度，公报竭力企图把责任推给苏联。据观察家指出，公报这样做是企图转移世界舆论对苏联各项具体和平建议的注意力。
    公报在谈到“联盟的工作”的部分承认，在西欧许多国家一再坚持的“政治协商”的问题上，仍然“需要进一步改善”。但是，在这方面它所提出的办法不过是要求各成员国把对北大西洋集团各国有重大影响的政策，“经常而充分地通知”各国在这个集团中的常任代表。此外，规定常任代表理事会和集团的秘书长进行“有效的协商”，并且在必要时“及早进行调停”。
    在谈到“经济合作”问题时，公报对发展西欧大陆六国的经济集团（共同市场）和英国策划的欧洲“自由贸易区”计划一概加以支持。同时，公报反映了西欧国家的要求，表示赞成“通过减少交流和贸易方面的障碍来扩大国际贸易”。公报还宣扬了北大西洋集团成员国和“自由世界”其他国家“在经济上互相依赖”的论调。
    公报宣布，北大西洋集团必须干预这个集团范围以外的事务。在这方面，它用“和平”、“合作”、“关心”中东人民的“经济福利”等字眼来掩饰这个军事集团的殖民主义凶恶性质和企图，并且避而不谈一些主要殖民国家在中东和非洲地区激烈的明争暗斗。公报还说，“某些欧洲国家和非洲之间在历史、经济和其他方面的友好联系”将会使得北大西洋集团成员国同非洲国家和人民的合作“特别适当和有效”，这样来支持法国之类的殖民国家在非洲的殖民利益和殖民统治。公报再次表明北大西洋集团支持荷兰和干涉印度尼西亚内政的立场，它把印度尼西亚反对荷兰殖民主义运动的高涨说成“印度尼西亚国内的严重事件”，并且表示“以关切的心情对待这种事件”。
    公报重复西方的惯伎，利用德国问题来毒化国际气氛。它把德国迟迟不能重新统一的责任硬推在苏联身上，同时重申西方坚持通过所谓“自由选举”来把西德的制度强加于民主德国的态度。
    新华社20日讯  巴黎消息：北大西洋集团最高级会议决定在明年举行两次部长级会议。
    预订在明年3月间召开这个集团国家的国防部长和主要的军事首脑的会议。据说，这次会议的目的是要为美国供应欧洲导弹的计划拟订军事方面的技术细节。
    北大西洋集团国家的外交部长和国防部长将在5月开会；他们将根据3月的会议后提出的具体建议和政局发展发布一项关于导弹“防御”工作的详细指示。
