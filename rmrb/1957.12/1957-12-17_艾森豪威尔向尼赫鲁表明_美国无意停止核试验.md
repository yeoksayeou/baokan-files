Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 15th - U.S. President Eisenhower, who is in Paris preparing to attend the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit, telegraphed Indian Prime Minister Nehru on the 15th. The telegram indicated that the United States does not intend to stop testing nuclear weapons.

Eisenhower's telegram was a response to Nehru's letters to the Soviet and U.S. governments on November 28th. In his letters, Nehru spoke of the threat to peace posed by the nuclear arms race and called for a halt to nuclear weapons testing. Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin, in his reply to Nehru on December 10th, stated that the Soviet Union was prepared to cease all nuclear weapons explosions from January 1st of next year, provided that the United States and Great Britain did the same.

In his telegram to Nehru, Eisenhower avoided mentioning the Soviet proposal and instead tried to defend the United States' engagement in the nuclear arms race. He repeated the old tune of the United States at the London meeting of the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee, saying that the issue of stopping nuclear weapons tests must first depend on reaching agreement on other disarmament measures and on stopping the production of military fissionable materials.

Eisenhower said that American "security" must "continue to depend to a very large extent" on American military weapons. The United States is at a stage where "testing is necessary" and that stopping nuclear weapons tests without depending on the above conditions would be "unacceptable" to the United States.

### 艾森豪威尔向尼赫鲁表明  美国无意停止核试验

　　艾森豪威尔向尼赫鲁表明
    美国无意停止核试验
    据新华社15日讯　巴黎消息：正在巴黎准备出席北大西洋集团政府首脑会议的美国总统艾森豪威尔，在15日打电报给印度总理尼赫鲁。电报中表明美国不打算停止试验核武器。
    艾森豪威尔的电报，是对尼赫鲁在11月28日给苏联政府和美国政府的信件的答复。尼赫鲁在他的信里谈到进行核武器竞赛对和平的威胁，并且要求停止试验核武器。苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁在12月10日函复尼赫鲁时声明：苏联准备从明年1月1日起停止任何核武器的爆炸，只要美国和英国也这样做。
    艾森豪威尔在给尼赫鲁的电报中避而不谈苏联的建议，却竭力为美国从事核军备竞赛进行辩护。他重弹美国在联合国裁军小组委员会伦敦会议上的旧调，说什么停止核武器试验问题必先取决于就其他裁军措施达成协议，并且取决于停止生产军用裂变物质。
    艾森豪威尔说：美国的“安全”必须“继续在极大程度上依靠”美国的军事武器。美国正处在“需要试验”的阶段，如果核武器试验的停止不取决于上述条件，那将是美国“所不能接受的”。
