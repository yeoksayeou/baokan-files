    Yunnan Water Conservancy Bureau Cadres Criticize Wasteful Practices
    Rebar Piled in the Open, Cement Left to Be Soaked by Rain
    (Our Dispatch) The Yunnan Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau is currently mobilizing all staff to launch a special "speaking out" campaign on "how to implement the spirit of diligence and thrift in water conservancy."
    Many big-character posters revealed that due to a lack of thorough planning and proper work arrangements, the waste of funds, manpower, and time is alarming. The bureau's survey and exploration team surveyed and drilled the Shiping Yangjie Reservoir and Qujing Xiaoxiang River Reservoir several times from 1954 to 1957. Reworking was caused by geological reasons. Taking the drilling team's relocation as an example, it cost several hundred yuan each time. Because the survey and exploration team's assignment was unclear, the First Survey Team was transferred to another county to undertake new tasks immediately after starting work in Songming. One big-character poster wrote: "The Xiangyun Reservoir wasted more than 10,000 yuan in design costs, more than 14,000 workdays in labor, and more than 80% of the construction soil was transported by people carrying it on their backs. There was no timely effort to seize transportation tools, wasting more than 150,000 workdays." There were also many cases of waste in construction sites due to poor prior planning, such as using large materials for small purposes. For example, the light rail of the Chaihe Reservoir, due to poor planning, some of it was installed but never used, or it was dismantled after a short period of use. The wood used for the Chaihe Reservoir spillway was sawn from four meters long to three meters long, and more than a thousand pieces of wood have not yet been used.
    According to big-character posters, work was hampered because the equipment group was irresponsible, did not understand the situation below, and did not understand the structure and performance of the equipment. For example, some equipment was not received after the notification was sent out, and some units received the equipment before receiving the notification, and even had cases of incorrect and missed shipments.
    The phenomenon of rebar being piled in the open and cement being left to be soaked by rain is also very common.
    The masses criticized the waste phenomenon and demanded that leading cadres not work high up in the office but go deep down. On the allocation of equipment, the masses requested that the leaders understand the situation and sign if they are confident, and not sign if they are not confident, so as not to turn good things into bad things.
    According to the criticisms and suggestions of the masses, the Yunnan Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau has put forward a plan for diligence and thrift in water conservancy, and is taking it to the masses for discussion.

### 云南水利局干部批评浪费现象  钢筋堆露天　水泥任雨淋

    云南水利局干部批评浪费现象
    钢筋堆露天　水泥任雨淋
    本报讯　云南省水利局目前就“如何贯彻勤俭办水利的精神”发动全体工作人员展开专题鸣放。
    许多大字报揭发：由于缺乏周密计划和没有妥善安排工作，资金、人力和时间的浪费很惊人。这个局的勘测总队从1954年到1957年勘查钻探石屏羊街水库和曲靖潇湘江水库好几次，因地质关系造成了返工，单以钻探队搬一次家来说就要几百元。因为勘测总队布置任务不明确，第一测量队到嵩明刚开始工作，又被调到别县担当新的任务。有一张大字报写着：“祥云水库在设计上浪费一万余元，劳动力浪费一万四千余工，施工土料运输80％以上人挑人背，没有及时抓运输工具，浪费劳动力十五万工以上。”事先规划不好，施工工地大材小用的浪费现象也很多。像柴河水库的轻便铁道，由于计划不周，有的安装起来根本没有使用，或者使用的时间很短就拆掉了。柴河水库溢洪道用的木料，把四公尺长的锯成三公尺，并且有一千多根木料还没有用过。
    据大字报揭发，因为器材组不负责任，不了解下情，又不懂器材的构造和性能，工作受到损失。如有的器材通知单发出去后，没有收到器材，有些单位收到器材后，还没收到通知单，甚至有错发和漏发器材的情况。
    钢筋堆在露天，水泥任雨淋的现象也很普遍。
    群众对浪费现象提出了批评，要求领导干部不要高高在办公室搞工作，要深入下去。在配备器材上，群众要求领导上了解一下情况，有把握再签字，无把握就不签，以免把好事办成坏事。
    云南省水利局根据群众的批评和建议，提出了勤俭办水利的方案，正在拿到群众中去讨论。
