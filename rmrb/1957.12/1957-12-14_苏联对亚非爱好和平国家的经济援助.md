　　Since the first day of its founding, the Soviet Union has consistently respected the national sovereignty and independence of the oppressed Asian and African countries, and supported their struggle for independence and freedom. After the war, as many Asian and African countries embarked on the road of national rejuvenation and adhered to an independent and autonomous policy, the relations between the Soviet Union and these countries developed on a new basis. The Soviet Union provided these countries with economic and technical assistance without any conditions, which greatly benefited the cause of peace and the progress of the world.

　　The Soviet Union has consistently supported the efforts of peace-loving Asian and African countries to develop their own industries and has specifically helped them implement industrialization plans. The Soviet Union is currently helping India build a steel plant with an annual output of 1.3 million tons of steel and will supply India with 1 million tons of steel in the next three years. On November 9 this year, the Soviet Union and India signed an agreement on Soviet assistance in establishing certain public industrial enterprises in India and the Soviet Union providing a loan of 500 million rubles (approximately 600 million Indian rupees). The Soviet loan will be used to build a heavy machinery manufacturing plant with an initial annual output of 45,000 tons, a coal mining machinery manufacturing plant with an annual output of 30,000 tons, a thermal power station with a power generation capacity of 250,000 kilowatts, an optical glass factory, and coal mining and coal washing enterprises. The Soviet side will prepare detailed engineering reports for all these enterprises and provide equipment, machinery and materials, technology and assistance. The Soviet Union agreed to send 700 specialized technicians and workers from India to study first-class production and technology methods in Soviet steel and mining enterprises. The Soviet Union also donated a senior industrial technology institute to India free of charge. During India's second five-year plan, the total amount of loans granted to India by the Soviet Union amounted to 1.8 billion rupees.

　　The Soviet Union signed a trade agreement with Burma in July 1955. According to Burma's wishes, the Soviet Union provided equipment for textile mills, rice mills, cotton gins, and hydroelectric power stations, tractors and other agricultural machinery, various lathes, and industrial equipment. In order to help Burma solve the difficulties in selling rice, in April last year, it was agreed to extend this agreement to five years. Burma will export 400,000 tons of rice to the Soviet Union annually in the next four years, and the Soviet Union will provide Burma with equipment, machinery, and other commodities, and provide technical and other assistance. The Soviet Union also donated a technical college to Burma to train technical personnel for Burma.

　　In September 1956, the Soviet Union and Indonesia signed an agreement on technical and economic assistance, granting Indonesia a loan of 100 million US dollars. The Soviet Union is willing to help Indonesia conduct a thorough exploration of resources such as coal mines, non-ferrous metals, and hydropower.

　　The Soviet Union has previously helped Afghanistan build cotton gins, erect about 1,500 kilometers of telegraph and telephone lines, and build several oil depots. In 1954, another agreement was signed on helping Afghanistan build a bread joint factory and renovate the urban area of ​​Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan. The Soviet Union supplies Afghanistan with equipment, machinery, and technical assistance in the form of loans. In January last year, the Soviet Union granted Afghanistan another US$100 million in loans to help Afghanistan develop agriculture, water conservancy construction, power, and transportation equipment.

　　The Soviet Union and Syria issued a joint communiqué on August 6, stating that the Soviet Union is ready to cooperate with Syria in railway and highway construction, hydropower station construction, irrigation projects, industrial construction, and geological exploration and design work, and will properly consider the issue of loaning to Syria to pay for design, exploration work, equipment supply, and other expenses. According to Syria's request, the Soviet Union will properly consider selling Syria machinery, equipment, materials, and other goods, and purchasing Syria's grain this year and increasing purchases of cotton and other commodities. On October 28, the Soviet Union and Syria signed an agreement on economic and technical cooperation in Damascus. This agreement came into effect on the 11th of this month after the exchange of instruments of ratification in Moscow.

　　In addition, in the past three years, the Soviet Union has also signed important economic agreements with Iran, Lebanon, Yemen and other countries. The Soviet Union is willing to provide selfless assistance to all countries striving for national independence and economic independence.

　　The Soviet Union is also a supporter of providing technical assistance to underdeveloped countries in accordance with the United Nations' policy. The Soviet Union, Ukraine, and Belarus donate funds directly to the United Nations Technical Assistance Fund Organization every year. The Soviet representative stated at the tenth session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East in February 1954 that the Soviet Union is willing to study the specific requirements of various countries in Asia and the Far East in terms of technical assistance in accordance with the United Nations Technical Assistance Fund plan, such as: developing the exploitation and processing industry of mineral raw materials, developing the metallurgical industry and machine manufacturing industry, especially the agricultural machine manufacturing industry, developing the textile industry, food industry, and rubber processing enterprises, building hydroelectric power stations and thermal power stations, as well as in water conservancy, locust control, training local cadres for industrial and other economic sectors and improving their technical level. This plan has aroused great interest in this region. The Soviet Union agreed to provide technical assistance in accordance with the UN policy at the request of India, Indonesia, Burma, Ceylon, and Jordan.

　　The Soviet Union has been at the forefront of the world in the peaceful use of atomic energy. However, the Soviet Union does not intend to monopolize this most important achievement in human science. The Soviet Union advocates the establishment of international cooperation and is willing to conduct research jointly with nuclear physicists from all countries. In July 1956, the Soviet Union and Egypt signed an agreement stipulating that the governments of the two countries will cooperate in nuclear physics research and the peaceful use of atomic energy by establishing devices and laboratories, providing equipment and instruments, exchanging experts, sending Egyptian experts to the Soviet Union for further studies, and conducting joint research. The Soviet Union will help Egypt build a nuclear physics laboratory equipped with a basic particle accelerator with an energy of 3 million electron volts. An experimental atomic reactor with 2,000 kilowatts is now under construction, which will be equipped with scientific laboratories. In September 1956, the Soviet Union signed an agreement with Indonesia to help Indonesia train technicians in the application of atomic energy and radioactive materials in medicine. The Soviet Union also intends to introduce its experience in the peaceful use of atomic energy to India and other countries.

　　The Soviet Union takes care of the difficulties of the countries being assisted in every way. The interest rate on Soviet foreign loans is very low. In order to take care of the foreign exchange and financial situation of these countries, the Soviet Union agreed that these countries can use their traditional export commodities to pay for commodities imported from the Soviet Union in trade with the Soviet Union, and can use their local currencies to pay and settle accounts. For example, Burma can use its difficult-to-sell rice to exchange for Soviet industrial equipment, and India can use rupees to repay Soviet loans, etc.

　　The Soviet Union's foreign aid is essentially different from the United States' "aid." It is not taking advantage of others' difficulties, but solving their problems. Last year, when the United States stopped supplying Egypt with grain in order to pressure Egypt to accept "international control" of the Suez Canal, the Soviet Union sold Egypt 200,000 tons of wheat to meet the needs of the Egyptian people. Syrian Minister of Public Works Kayyali expressed his gratitude for Soviet assistance on August 24, saying: "The Soviet Union will purchase approximately 450,000 tons of Syrian agricultural products, so we can prevent our economy from being hit as it was last year. Last year, when we wanted to sell agricultural products to Italy, the United States sold a large amount of agricultural products to Italy at low prices, attempting to destroy our economy."

　　Based on their own experience, Asian and African countries are convinced that establishing economic ties with the Soviet Union in various fields can consolidate their national independence, enhance mutual understanding and cooperation among countries, and benefit the cause of world peace.

### 苏联对亚非爱好和平国家的经济援助

　　苏联对亚非爱好和平国家的经济援助
    苏联自立国的第一天起，就始终不渝地尊重被压迫的亚非国家的民族主权和独立，支持亚非国家争取独立自由的斗争。战后，由于许多亚非国家走上民族复兴的道路，并且坚持独立自主的政策，苏联同这些国家的关系在新的基础上发展起来了，苏联对这些国家给予不附带任何条件的经济和技术援助，大大有利于和平事业和全世界的进步。
    苏联一贯支持亚非爱好和平国家在发展本国工业上所作的努力，并且具体帮助它们实现工业化的计划。苏联目前正在帮助印度建设一座年产一百三十万吨钢材的炼钢厂，并将在最近三年内供应印度一百万吨钢材。今年11月9日，苏印两国签订了一项关于苏联帮助印度建立某些公营工业企业和苏联给予五亿卢布（约合六亿印度卢比）贷款的协定。苏联的贷款将用于建造一座初期年产四万五千吨的重型机械制造厂，一座年产三万吨的采煤机械制造厂，一座发电能力二十五万瓩的热电站，一座光学玻璃工厂，以及采煤和选煤企业。苏联方面将为所有这些企业准备详细的工程报告，并且提供设备，机器和材料，技术和援助。苏联同意由印度派遣七百名专门技术人员和工人到苏联的钢铁和采矿企业中学习生产和工艺的第一流方法。苏联还无偿地赠送给印度一所高级工业技术学院。在印度第二个五年计划期间，苏联给予印度贷款的总额达十八亿卢比。
    苏联在1955年7月和缅甸签订贸易协定。按照缅甸的愿望，苏联提供纺织厂、碾米厂、轧棉厂和水电站的装备、拖拉机和其他农业机器，各种车床和工业器材。为了帮助缅甸解决销售大米的困难，去年4月，又协议把这一协定延长到五年，缅甸在今后四年内，每年将向苏联输出四十万吨大米，而苏联将向缅甸提供装备、机器和其他商品，并给予技术和其他援助。苏联还赠送给缅甸一所工艺学院，为缅甸培养技术人才。
    1956年9月，苏联与印度尼西亚签订了技术援助和经济援助的协定，给予印度尼西亚一亿美元的贷款。苏联愿意帮助印度尼西亚对煤矿、非铁金属、水力发电等资源进行彻底的勘查。
    苏联过去已经帮助阿富汗建立了轧棉厂、架设了约一千五百公里的电报线和电话线，建设了好几处储油库。1954年，又签订了关于帮助阿富汗建设一座面包联合工厂和整修阿富汗首都喀布尔市区的协定。苏联以贷款方式为阿富汗供应装备、机器和提供技术援助。去年1月，苏联又给予阿富汗一亿美元的贷款，帮助阿富汗发展农业、水利建设、电力和运输设备。
    苏联和叙利亚在8月6日发表联合公报说：苏联准备在铁路和公路建设、水电站建设、灌溉工程、工业建设以及地质勘探和设计工作等方面与叙利亚进行合作，并将妥善考虑有关贷款给叙利亚作为支付设计、勘探工作、装备供应和其他各项开支的费用的问题。根据叙利亚的要求，苏联将妥善考虑售给叙利亚机器、装备、材料和其它货物，并且购买叙利亚今年的谷物和增购棉花等商品的问题。10月28日，苏叙两国在大马士革签订了关于经济和技术合作协定。这个协定已在本月11日于莫斯科交换批准书后生效。
    此外，在过去三年间，苏联还和伊朗、黎巴嫩、也门等国签订了重要的经济协定。苏联愿意向一切争取民族独立和经济独立的国家提供无私的援助。
    苏联又是根据联合国方针向经济不发达国家提供技术援助的拥护者。苏联、乌克兰和白俄罗斯，每年都直接对联合国技术援助基金组织捐助基金。苏联代表在1954年2月联合国亚洲与远东经济委员会第十届会议上声明，苏联愿意根据联合国技术援助基金计划，研究亚洲和远东各国在技术援助方面的具体要求，例如：发展矿物原料的开采和加工工业、发展冶金工业和机器制造工业，特别是农业机器制造工业、发展纺织工业、食品工业和橡胶加工企业，建设水力发电站和火力发电站，以及在水利、灭蝗、为工业和其他经济部门训练本国干部并提高他们的技术水平等方面。这项计划已引起了这一地区的很大兴趣。苏联同意根据印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、锡兰、约旦的请求依据联合国的方针提供技术援助。
    苏联在和平利用原子能方面已经走在全世界的前头。但是苏联并没有打算垄断这个人类科学上最重要的成果。苏联主张建立国际合作，愿意同一切国家的核子物理学家们共同进行研究。1956年7月，苏联和埃及签订协定，规定两国政府将通过建立装置和实验室、提供设备和仪器、交换专家、派遣埃及专家到苏联进修和进行共同研究，在核子物理研究和和平利用原子能方面进行合作。苏联将帮助埃及修建一个装有能量达三百万电子伏特的基本粒子加速器的核子物理实验所，现在正修建一个有两千瓩的实验性的原子反应堆，它将设有科学实验室。1956年9月，苏联与印度尼西亚签订协定，帮助印度尼西亚在原子能和放射性物质在医学的应用方面训练技术人员。苏联也打算把和平利用原子能方面的经验介绍给印度以及其他国家。
    苏联处处照顾被援助国家的困难。苏联对外贷款的利息很低。为了照顾这些国家的外汇和财政情况，苏联同意这些国家在同苏联贸易时，可以用它们传统输出的商品来偿付从苏联输入的商品，并且可以用它们本国的货币来支付和清偿。例如，缅甸可以用它销售困难的大米来换取苏联的工业装备，印度可以用卢比来偿付苏联的贷款等。
    苏联的对外援助和美国的“援助”有本质的不同。它不是乘人之危，而是解人之困。去年美国为了要压迫埃及接受对苏伊士运河的“国际管制”而停止供给埃及粮食的时候，苏联却卖给埃及二十万吨小麦，满足埃及人民的需要。叙利亚公共工程部长卡雅利在8月24日表示感谢苏联的援助时说：“苏联将购买大约四十五万吨叙利亚农产品，因此我们就可以使我国经济不致像去年那样受到打击。去年在我们要把农产品卖给意大利的时候，美国却以贱价卖给意大利大量的农产品，企图借此摧毁我国经济。”
    亚非国家根据本身的经验确信，同苏联发生各方面的经济联系，能够巩固它们的民族独立，增进各国间互相了解和合作，而且有利于世界和平事业。　（新）
