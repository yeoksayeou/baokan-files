　　Hops
    Hops are perennial, vine-like climbing plants, with vines reaching about five meters in length, long internodes, and palmate leaves. The flowers grow on the nodes of lateral branches; female flowers are cone-shaped, while male flowers are conical. The female flowers are the part used for practical purposes. Both male and female flowers lack petals, having only sepals and stamens/pistils.

    Hops have many names, including "jiuhua" (酒花), "shemahua" (蛇麻花), "tanghuacao" (唐花草), etc. Because the female flowers are used for making beer, they are commonly called hops.

    Hops have significant uses. Besides being an important ingredient in brewing beer, giving it a special aroma, they also have medicinal properties, such as aiding digestion, acting as a diuretic, and having a sedative effect. Hops are also an important additive for preserving yeast and making bread, helping to prevent bread from spoiling.

    Hops are a valuable special economic crop, with an export price of over 20 yuan per kilogram. Hops play a very important role in the export trade of countries such as Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia.

    However, hop production in our country is currently not high. This is because in the old society, many people believed that the domestic climate was not suitable for hop cultivation, and most hops were imported at high prices. Cultivation was only emphasized after liberation. Successful trials began in Qingdao and other places in 1952. At present, it has been推广到extended to Qingdao, Beijing, the Northeast, and other regions. (Wang Rui?) (With picture)

　　啤酒花
    啤酒花系多年生的蔓性藤本植物，蔓长约五公尺，节间很长，叶掌状。酒花开在侧枝节上，雌花为松球果状，雄花为圆锥形。日常所利用的是雌花。雌雄花都没有花瓣，只有花萼包片、雌雄蕊。
    啤酒花名称很多，有酒花、蛇麻花、唐花草……等，因雌花供制啤酒用，故通称为啤酒花。
    啤酒花用途很大，除了作为酿制啤酒的一种重要添加原料，使啤酒具有特殊香味以外，同时又具有医药效能，如健胃，利尿，镇静作用等。啤酒花同时是酵母保存和制造面包的重要添加料，它能使面包不易腐坏。
    啤酒花是一种贵重的特用经济作物，出口价格每公斤二十多元。啤酒花在捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、南斯拉夫等国的出口贸易中就占很重要的地位。
    但是目前我国酒花生产还不多。因为在旧社会里，许多人都认为国内风土不适于啤酒花的栽培，酒花大多是高价进口。解放后才注意培植，1952年开始在青岛等地试栽成功。目前已推广到青岛、北京、东北等地。　（王瑞?）（附图片）
