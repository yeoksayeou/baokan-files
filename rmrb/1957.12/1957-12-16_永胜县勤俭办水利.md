Yongsheng County Diligently and Thriftily Manages Water Conservancy
　　Zixing Yi
　　Yongsheng County, located in the southern border of the motherland, is known both inside and outside Yunnan Province for relying on the masses to diligently and thriftily develop water conservancy.
　　Yongsheng County is a multi-ethnic, semi-mountainous county. Although there are many mountains and broad ravines, due to backward production and slash-and-burn cultivation (heavily felling forests to burn and plant on mountains) before liberation, most of the mountainous areas became bare mountains and broken ravines. In addition, steep slopes and rapid water flow meant that water sources dried up quickly, often resulting in "flood disasters when it rained, and drought disasters when it didn't," and agricultural production increases were not guaranteed. Of the county's more than 360,000 mu of cultivated land, only more than 40,000 mu of paddy fields could guarantee harvests before liberation. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the government, water conservancy construction was carried out year by year. By the end of 1956, more than 4,000 medium and small-sized water conservancy projects had been repaired, the area of paddy fields had increased 1.8 times, and flood and waterlogging disasters had also been greatly reduced.
　　Overcoming the Mentality of Relying on the Government
　　In 1957, on the basis of the basic advanced collectivization of the entire county, the Party committee fully mobilized the masses and diligently and thriftily developed water conservancy. The original plan was to borrow 110,000 yuan, but after mobilizing the masses to increase production and practice economy, the government only loaned 1,640 yuan (of which 700 yuan was loaned but not used). Due to the large-scale construction of water conservancy projects, it is estimated that the county can increase grain production by 4.22 million jin this year, accounting for 21.8% of the county's total increase in production.
　　In the past few years, due to state investment in several medium-sized projects, coupled with insufficient ideological mobilization, cadres and the masses generally requested the government to pay for the construction of large projects. In addition, the major and minor spring crops in 1956 suffered from drought and insect pests, reducing production and income for the masses. Objective difficulties further aggravated the masses' reliance on the government to build water conservancy projects. When winter repairs began, many cadres and masses pinned their hopes on state-invested medium-sized projects, and water conservancy work could not be started.
　　After the district and county Party committees discovered these situations, they believed that carrying out water conservancy construction in the context of reduced state investment and loan quotas and low incomes for the masses in 1956 required criticizing the mentality of greed for large projects and neglecting small ones, as well as relying on the government, and conscientiously implementing the principles of focusing on small-scale projects and managing water conservancy diligently and thriftily. The county Party committee specifically analyzed the three aspects of water conservancy projects that used the most cash: non-beneficiary villagers' labor wages, technical and stonemason wages, and tool and equipment costs, and these three aspects could be managed to save expenses. Therefore, the county Party committee decided to call on the entire Party and all rural work cadres to fully mobilize and rely on the masses, overcome all difficulties, and rely on their own strength to diligently and thriftily manage water conservancy.
　　The county Party committee summarized the experiences of advanced townships such as Lang'e, Zhangpei, and Muke, and promoted them throughout the county. Lang'e Township persisted in hard work for three years of year-round construction and built a large ditch more than 150 li long. This township did not have technical cadres, so the masses came up with various ways to measure; life was difficult, so the laborers themselves extracted part of their labor force to engage in sideline production to support water conservancy; lacking tools, they made them themselves. Zhangpei and Muke townships did not hire stonemasons, but trained their own, saving a large amount of expenses. On the contrary, medium-sized projects such as Longtan, which were contracted by the government, not only used a lot of labor, but also fostered the masses' dependence mentality, and farmers' demands for government investment became higher and higher.
　　Professional Organizations for Year-Round Construction
　　Is it better to repair water conservancy projects through temporary shock tactics, or through year-round construction? The county Party committee summarized the experiences of some townships and cooperatives and affirmed: the practice of extracting a certain amount of labor from the cooperative to organize a professional water conservancy engineering team to carry out water conservancy construction year-round, believing that this has five major benefits: First, it promotes the rational division of labor in agricultural cooperatives, avoiding temporary shock repairs to water conservancy and disrupting production plans; Second, laborers are skilled and familiar with the work, which can improve work efficiency and ensure quality and safety; Third, with professional construction, technical level can be improved and planning strengthened; Fourth, with sound organizational leadership, attendance rate can be improved; Fifth, with a professional water conservancy team, decisive water conservancy measures can be grasped in a planned and step-by-step manner to complete on schedule.
　　In 1957, the county's 101 townships organized a total of 65 township or cooperative water conservancy engineering teams. The number of people in each team was determined by the amount of labor and the size of the project in the township or cooperative, with the smallest being 30 people and the largest being 150 people. Generally, the number of people extracted accounted for 5%-10% of the cooperative's labor force. Combined with contracting work and output, advanced and active elements with experience in water conservancy were fixed to water conservancy work. The water conservancy engineering team implemented fixed-quota contracting and paid according to labor. After the masses mutually agreed through consultation, water conservancy work points were slightly higher than agricultural work points by one to two points. This encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses to build water conservancy projects and eliminated the phenomenon of loafing on the job in the past. This also avoided the phenomenon of old, weak, child laborers, and pregnant women going to the construction site, and the attendance rate was greatly improved. Last year, the labor situation was tight during planting; this year, the county transferred out 3,500 laborers to support national defense transportation, and more than 1,000 people were also occupied in water conservancy, but the county completed transplanting one season earlier.
　　After the establishment of the engineering team, a more prominent problem encountered was the overspending of laborers' rations, the lack of non-staple food expenses, and pocket money. To persist in year-round construction, the engineering team cannot be consolidated without solving these two problems. The solution is: according to different situations, for medium-sized projects, the state granary will supplement the staple food – rice; for small-scale projects, the surplus grain in the cooperative's granary will solve the problem, and if it is insufficient, the cooperative will uniformly borrow from the state granary; in economic crop areas, the state granary will directly allocate the grain. The non-staple food expenses are solved by the water conservancy team developing sideline production. Sideline production projects include digging medicinal materials, sawing planks, burning charcoal, burning lime, etc., more than ten kinds, and the income is used by the team to solve non-staple food and pocket money. Generally, the number of people extracted for sideline production by the water conservancy team accounts for one-tenth or one-twentieth of the labor force in the team. The water conservancy engineering teams in 24 townships throughout the county have all developed sideline production according to local conditions, not only borrowing less from the state, but also not asking for money from the cooperative.
　　In order to solve the problem of technical workers, this year a large number of stonemasons were trained throughout the county, implementing the measures of master apprenticeship, and converting plasterers and blacksmiths, to save stonemason wage expenses. Eighty-one townships in the county have trained their own stonemasons, not only meeting the needs of the county, but also transferring 45 stonemasons to other counties to support road construction work.
　　Saving Expenses and Reducing Costs
　　In the process of water conservancy construction, various methods are adopted to save tool and equipment expenses. First, clean up the old equipment of the original projects and uniformly control the allocation and use. The equipment cleaned out from the medium-sized projects not only met the needs of the Banshan River and other two flood control projects, and the Machangping and other two reservoirs, but also supported 22 townships, so that these 22 townships did not buy equipment. Mobilizing the townships and cooperatives to clean up small-scale project equipment also saved a lot of expenses. Some townships and cooperatives also invented the use of joining together one- or two-inch short cannon rods. Second, strengthen management, save use, and extend the life of tools and equipment. On the one hand, educate the laborers to cherish tools, and on the other hand, mobilize everyone to discuss and formulate specific methods for use and management. For example, give the tools an effective service life, and criticize or deduct work points for waste. Include the protection of tools in the content of evaluating models. In this way, the laborers consciously came up with many ways to extend the life of the tools. Third, mobilize the masses to bring their own tools to support the project. As long as the problem of the equivalent value of the tools is solved, the masses are happy to take out good tools. Fourth, the tools and equipment should be repaired and manufactured by the members as much as possible, and a certain number of work points should be awarded, which is also an important aspect of saving. According to preliminary statistics from 14 townships, the total value of lime and charcoal self-burned, wooden and bamboo agricultural tools self-made, and iron agricultural tools self-repaired in half a year reached more than 10,300 yuan. Some townships even mined their own saltpeter and made their own explosives.

　　永胜县勤俭办水利
　　子星乙
    地处祖国南疆的永胜县，以依靠群众勤俭兴办水利而闻名于云南省内外。
    永胜县是个多民族杂居的半山区县，虽然山多阱广，但解放前由于生产落后、刀耕火种（大砍森林烧种山地）的结果，大部山区成了光山破阱。加之坡陡水急，水源枯绝很快，经常是“有雨洪灾，无雨旱灾”，农业增产没有保证。全县三十六万多亩耕地，解放前仅有四万多亩的水田可以保收。解放后，在党和政府的领导下，逐年开展了水利建设，到1956年底止，共整修中、小型水利工程四千多件，水田面积增加了一点八倍，洪灾和涝灾也大大减轻。
    克服依赖政府思想
    1957年，在全县基本高级合作化的基础上，党委充分发动群众、勤俭兴办水利，原计划贷款十一万元，经过发动群众、增产节约后，政府只贷了一千六百四十元（其中还有七百元贷了未用）。由于大量兴修了水利工程，预计今年全县可增加粮食四百二十二万斤，占全县总增产数的21.8％。
    过去几年，由于国家投资兴办了几件中型工程，加上思想发动不够，因而从干部到群众普遍要求政府出钱修大工程。加之1956年大春小春作物遭受旱虫灾害减了产，群众收入不多，客观上的困难更加重了群众依赖政府修水利的思想。冬修开始了，由于很多干部和群众都把希望寄托在国家投资的中型工程上，水利工作动不起来。
    地、县委发现了这些情况后，认为在国家投资和贷款指标减少，群众1956年收入不多的情况下进行水利建设必须批判贪大放小和依靠政府的思想，认真执行以小型为主和勤俭办水利的方针。县委具体分析了水利工程上使用现款最多的三个方面：即非受益乡民工工资，技术、石工工资，工具器材费用，而这三方面是可以设法节省经费的。于是县委决定，号召全党和全体农村工作干部，充分发动和依靠群众，克服一切困难，依靠自己力量勤俭办水利。
    县委总结了莨莪、章裴、睦科等先进乡的经验，推动全县。莨莪乡坚持常年施工苦干三年，修通了长达一百五十多里长的一条大沟。这个乡没有技术干部，群众想出多种办法来测量；生活困难，民工自己就抽出部分劳力搞副业生产来支援水利；缺乏工具就自己造。章裴、睦科两乡没有请石工，自己培养石工，节省了大批经费。相反，由政府包办的龙潭等中型工程，不但用工多，而且助长了群众的依赖思想，农民们对政府投资的要求越来越高。
    专业组织常年施工
    水利工程的兴修，是临时突击好，还是常年施工好？县委总结了一些乡、社的经验，肯定了：由社内抽出一定劳力，组织专业的水利工程队，常年兴修水利的做法，认为这样做有五大好处：一、促进农业社的合理分工，避免临时突击修水利，打乱生产计划；二、民工熟脚熟手，可以提高工效，保证质量和安全；三、有了专业的施工，可以提高技术水平，加强计划性；四、有了健全的组织领导，可以提高出勤率；五、有了专业的水利队伍，可以有计划有步骤地抓住对增产有决定意义的水利措施，按期完成。
    1957年，全县一百零一个乡共组织了六十五个乡或社的水利工程队。各队人数是由乡、社劳力多少、工程大小决定的，最少的三十人，最多的一百五十人。一般所抽人数占全社劳力的5％—10％。结合包工包产，就把对水利有经验的先进积极分子固定到水利工作上。水利工程队实行定额包工，按劳付酬，经过群众互相商得同意，水利工分稍高于农业的一至二分。这样就鼓舞了群众兴修水利的积极性，消灭了以往磨洋工的现象。这样做，也避免了老弱、童工、孕妇上工地的现象，出勤率大大提高。去年栽插时，劳力使用状况紧张；今年全县为支援国防运输，外调劳力三千五百个，水利方面也占用了一千多人，可是全县反而提前一个节令栽完了秧。
    工程队成立后，遇到比较突出的问题，是民工口粮超支、副食费及零用开支不足。要坚持常年兴修，这两个问题不解决，工程队就无法巩固。解决的办法是：根据不同情况，兴修中型工程的，由国家粮库补给主食——大米；小型工程的，由社内的社仓余粮解决，不敷时由社统一向国家粮库借补；经济作物区，直接由国家粮库拨补。副食费由水利队内开展副业生产来解决。副业生产项目有挖药材、解板子、烧木炭、烧石灰等十多种，收入归队解决副食及零用。一般水利队所抽副业人数，占队内劳力的十分之一或二十分之一。全县二十四个乡的水利工程队，都因地制宜地开展了副业生产，不但少向国家贷款，也没有向合作社内去要钱。
    为了解决技术工的问题，今年在全县培养了大批石工，实行师傅带徒弟，泥水工、锻磨匠改行等措施，来节约石工工资开支。全县有八十一个乡，都培养出自己的石工，不仅满足了本县需要，还调出外县四十五个石工，支援修路工作。
    节省费用降低成本
    在水利建设过程中，采取多种办法，节省工具器材费用。第一、清理原有工程的旧有器材，统一掌握调配使用。从中型工程中清理出来的器材，满足了板山河等两个防洪工程、马厂坪等两个水库所需的大部器材外，还支援了二十二个乡，使这二十二个乡没有买器材。发动各乡、社清理小型工程器材，也节约了很多的经费。有的乡、社还发明把一二寸长的短炮杆接起来再用。第二、加强保管，节约使用，延长工具器材寿命。一面教育民工爱护工具，一面发动大家讨论，制订了使用、管理的具体办法。如给工具评出有效使用期，对浪费的，批评或扣工分。把爱护工具列入评比模范的内容。这样，民工都自觉地想了很多办法延长工具寿命。第三、发动群众自带工具，支援工程。只要解决了工具的等价问题后，群众是乐意拿出好工具的。第四、工具器材尽量发动社员自修自造，评给一定工分，这也是节约的一个重要方面。据十四个乡的初步统计，半年内自烧石灰和木炭、自造木竹农具、自修铁农具的总值达一万零三百多元。有的乡连炸药也是自己采硝自己造的。
