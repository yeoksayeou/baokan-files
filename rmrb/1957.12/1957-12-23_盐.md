    Salt
    Zhang Mingzhe
    Legend has it that long ago, there were two brothers. The younger brother was a simple farmer, while the elder brother was a greedy miser. One day, the younger brother found a magic millstone in the field that could continuously grind out salt. The greedy elder brother, upon learning of this, tricked his younger brother into giving him the millstone, put it on a boat, and prepared to sell salt overseas to make a fortune. After setting sail, the millstone indeed continuously ground out snow-white salt. Before long, the salt was almost filling the boat, and only then did he realize he hadn't learned how to stop the mill. But the boat became heavier and heavier, and finally, both the man and the boat sank to the bottom of the sea. Naturally, the magic millstone is still turning non-stop at the bottom of the sea, so the seawater is salty, and sea salt is always inexhaustible.
    Of course, this is just a myth. How did salt really come about?
    After it formed within the Earth's crust, due to volcanic eruptions, it was sprayed onto the ground along with molten substances. Dissolved by rainwater, it flowed into the ocean and lakes through rivers. Over a long period of time, there became a lot of salt in the sea and lakes. This is the origin of sea salt and lake salt. In provinces such as Sichuan and Yunnan in China, well water is extracted and boiled to produce salt, which is called well salt. In some places in Xinjiang, Sichuan, and other provinces, solid salt can be directly mined from underground, which is rock salt.
    As the saying goes, "The seven necessities to begin the day are firewood, rice, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, and tea." This illustrates that salt is an indispensable part of our lives.
    Salt exists in the human body as sodium ions and chloride ions. These two substances play a regulatory role in the body: preventing the water inside the body from being too much or too little in a certain place, and also maintaining the body's acid-base balance, so that the body does not develop diseases due to excessive acidity (or alkalinity).
    Usually, the human body contains about four taels of salt. Salt in the human body acts like a gate, separating and maintaining the balance between intracellular fluid, interstitial fluid, and blood within the body. When sweating too much, people feel thirsty and want to drink water. At the same time, a lot of salt has been excreted with the sweat. If you drink too much water, because the tissue lacks salt, the water will penetrate into the intracellular fluid, resulting in water loss in the interstitial fluid and water intoxication in the cells. The dizziness or convulsions that occur in workers in high-temperature workshops such as steel factories are caused by water deficiency in the tissues and too much water and too little salt in the muscle cells and nerve cells, disrupting the normal balance of water and salt in the body. Therefore, workers in high-temperature workshops need to drink salt soda regularly, and not just plain water. If you eat too much salt, the increased sodium content in the body will result in a large amount of potassium being excreted. Potassium, in addition to maintaining normal water and acidity in the body, also promotes tissue growth. Lack of potassium will slow down or stop tissue growth. Normally, people need to eat about five or six qian of salt per day, and a little more or a little less doesn't matter much. Because the body's tissue function has a very ingenious effect: it always tries to maintain a certain amount of salt in the body. If there is too much, it will be excreted in the urine; if there is too little, the amount of salt excreted will also decrease. Of course, too much or too little is not good. Some people like to eat saltier or lighter food, mainly due to habit. Some people say that without salt, there is no strength. In fact, strength mainly consumes calories, that is to say, it mainly relies on carbohydrates and fats in the body to provide calories. Of course, using strength easily causes sweating, and salt is also excreted more with sweat, so people who use strength should eat more salt, mainly to replenish the body's salt content. The statement that without salt, there is no strength is unscientific.
    Salt has a wide range of uses in our daily lives. We can't do without salt for cooking and eating every day, and we still need salt for pickling vegetables and meat. The reason why pickled vegetables can be stored for a long time without spoiling is that salt water easily absorbs water from other places to become thinner, so the water inside the bacteria in the vegetables or meat slowly runs into the salt water, and the bacteria therefore wither and die. Putting some salt in vinegar to prevent white mold is also the same principle.
    Salt is also a cheap medicine and industrial raw material. A person who is often constipated can help with bowel movements by drinking a glass of salt water every morning. The physiological saline used for intravenous injection in hospitals is a water solution containing 0.85% salt. In industry, salt can be used to make caustic soda, alkali, and hydrochloric acid. Chlorine obtained by electrolyzing salt water can be used to make bleaching powder and disinfect tap water. The steel industry often uses 10%-15% salt water for quenching.
    From this, it seems that the role of salt in people's lives and production has far exceeded the task given to it in the "seven necessities to begin the day."

    盐
    张明哲
    相传在很久以前，有兄弟二人，弟弟是一个纯朴的农民，而哥哥却是一个贪得无厌的财迷。一天，弟弟在田里拾到了一只神磨，这个神磨能不断的磨出盐来。贪婪的哥哥知道了，便从弟弟那里骗取了神磨，把它放在船上，准备到远洋以外去卖盐发财。开船后，那石磨果然不断地磨出雪白的盐来。不多久，盐就快装满船了，这时他才想起没有学会停磨的办法。可是船已越来越重，最后终于连人带船都沉了下去。自然，那只神磨还在海底不停的转，所以海水是咸的，海盐老是那么取之不尽、用之不竭。
    这当然只是神话，盐到底是怎样来的呢？
    它是在地壳内形成以后，由于火山的爆发，随着融熔的东西喷到地面上来，被雨水溶解后，经过河川而流入海洋和湖沼内，天长日久，海里湖里都有了很多盐。这就是海盐和池盐的来源。我国四川、云南等省有把井水取出来熬盐的，叫作井盐。新疆、四川等省有些地方可以直接从地下开采出成块的盐，这就是岩盐。
    俗话说：“开门七件事，柴米油盐酱醋茶”。这就说明盐是我们生活中不可缺少的东西。
    盐在人体内是以钠离子和氯离子存在着。这两种东西在身体内都起着调节作用：不使人体内部的水分在某处过多或者过少，还维持体内的酸碱平衡，使身体不致因酸度（或碱度）过大而发生病症。
    通常人体内约含盐四两多。盐在人体内像闸门一样，把身体内部的细胞内液、组织间液和血液分开并保持平衡。出汗太多时，人们便感到口渴想喝水。同时许多盐已随着汗一起被排泄出，如果喝多了水，因为组织内缺少盐分，水便渗透入细胞内液中，而成组织间液失水和细胞内的水中毒。钢铁厂等高温车间的工人发生头晕或抽搐，就是因为组织内缺水，而肌肉细胞和神经细胞内的水太多、盐太少，失去体内水与盐的正常平衡所引起的。所以高温车间的工人需要常喝盐汽水，而不能只喝白开水。如果吃盐太多，体内所含的钠随着增加过多的结果，便使体内所含的钾大量排泄出去。钾在人体内除了维持正常的水分和酸碱度外，还促进组织的生长。缺乏钾，组织生长就迟缓或者停止。平常人们每天吃进去的盐大约需要五、六钱，稍多一些或稍少一些并没有太大关系。因为人体的组织机能有一种非常巧妙的作用：它总要设法保持体内有一定的盐分。多了就从尿中排泄出去；少了排泄出去的盐也会减少。当然过多或过少就不行了。有人喜欢吃的咸一些或淡一些，主要是习惯的关系。有人说，不吃盐就没有力气。其实力气主要是消耗热量，也就是说主要依靠体内的糖类和脂肪供给热量。当然，用力气容易出汗，盐也随着汗流排泄较多，所以用力气的人吃盐要多一些，主要是为了补充体内的盐分。不吃盐就没有力气的说法是不科学的。
    盐的用途，在我们日常生活中是很广泛的。每天作菜吃饭固然离不了盐，腌菜、腌肉也还是需要盐。腌菜之所以能长久放置不坏，是因为盐水很容易从别的地方吸水使自己变得稀一些，这样菜或肉里的细菌体内的水分，便慢慢跑到盐水中去，而细菌因此干瘪而死去。醋里边放些盐可以防止长白毛，也是这个道理。
    盐还是便宜的药剂和工业的原料。一个时常便秘的人，如果每天清晨喝一杯盐开水，可以帮助通大便。医院里静脉注射用的生理食盐水，就是含有0.85％食盐的水溶液，在工业上，盐可以用来制烧碱、碱和盐酸等。电解食盐水得到的氯可以制漂白粉和自来水消毒用。钢铁工业上常用10％—15％的食盐水蘸火。
    由此看来，盐在人们生活和生产上所起的作用，已经远远超过“开门七件事”中所给予它的任务了。
