Xinhua News Agency, December 17th: In order to seize the opportunity to carry out rectification quickly, effectively, and thoroughly, central state organs are currently widely organizing the masses to review the rectification work and are urging lagging units to catch up.

According to statistics, during this period of extensive airing of views ("Da Ming Da Fang"), the masses put forward more than 940,000 criticisms and suggestions for improving work, touching on all aspects of the "three bad tendencies" of leading organs. Currently, the rectification movement in more than two-thirds of the units has reached a climax and achieved significant results. However, the development of the movement is uneven. Inspections up to the beginning of December revealed that more than 300 bureau-level units had completed less than 30% of their rectification tasks. These units had not seized the opportunity, and the movement was in a lagging state. In particular, it was also discovered that six bureau-level units had become stagnant after the masses aired their views, with leaders failing to rectify even a single one of the numerous criticisms.

Inspections also revealed that among the problems that had been rectified, the phenomena of "half-cooked rice" (incomplete rectification), improper rectification, and false rectifications still existed to a considerable extent in some units. The fundamental reason for this phenomenon is that some leading cadres still displayed a bureaucratic style in the rectification movement.

The various organs noted that, in order to promote the rapid and healthy development of the rectification movement, grasping inspections and strengthening leadership over lagging units have become important links in deepening the rectification movement.

The units in the industrial, transportation, and financial and trade systems, where the movement developed relatively quickly, have recently conducted reviews of their rectification efforts. Some units have mobilized the masses to conduct comprehensive inspections. After the rectification in the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry entered a climax, it was found that some units had low rectification quality, and some problems were simply "explained" by the leaders and considered rectified; some were treated as "reference" opinions and not seriously addressed; and some were simply pushed to other departments to handle. For example, the Iron and Steel Department of the Black Metallurgical Design Institute received 28 criticisms regarding the unclear division of labor of the department head. The department did not conduct any research but "transferred it to the institute's system reform team for resolution." A department head of the Metallurgical Equipment Department, without discussing it with everyone, handled 96 issues related to cadre work style on his own, writing "noted for reference" with a stroke of the pen. The masses expressed great dissatisfaction with this bureaucratic attitude. In order to correct these situations, the ministry took measures: the ministry's rectification leading group conducted spot checks, the leading groups of each bureau conducted general inspections, and the masses were mobilized to conduct general reviews. Some units of the Ministry of Finance organized the masses to conduct blanket checks in different areas. During the review, the masses were mobilized to discuss "Which of your suggestions have not been resolved? Which problems have not been handled satisfactorily? What problems should be improved but have not been raised?" Through this discussion, the masses not only checked the phenomenon of low rectification quality but also continued to air their views.

In order to prevent omissions and correct errors and improve the quality of rectification, the Water Transport Design Institute of the Ministry of Communications adopted a comprehensive inspection method combining leadership and the masses during the rectification process and proposed to combine "inspection, supervision, and airing of views," which promoted rectification and encouraged in-depth airing of views. During the review, the masses of the Ship Branch of the design institute criticized a section chief for being "still stiff in his attitude" in contacting the masses and demanded serious improvement. Through the review, the branch also received 18 opinions on unreasonable wages and unclear responsibilities of certain leading cadres.

Since mid-December, the work of reviewing rectification has been generally launched in various organs. Some organs have specifically designated a time for review, and many units have also conducted inspections through meetings of representatives of organ employees. During the inspection, the masses put up big-character posters criticizing the bureaucratic style in rectification and the phenomenon of unreasonable rectification. This mass inspection movement actually formed another criticism movement. Someone in the Ministry of Construction Engineering posted a big-character poster titled "Don't Praise Too Early," sharply criticizing the minister's simple "case-by-case" review in the rectification process, pointing out that some problems were explained unsatisfactorily, and some "did not touch the essence of the problem." The big-character poster demanded that the minister not treat the criticisms of the masses with only "beautiful promises." Under this strict criticism and supervision, the minister earnestly carried out rectification and personally handled nearly a hundred opinions in three days.

Through the supervision and inspection of the masses, the incomplete phenomena in the rectification process were promptly corrected, and the masses were very satisfied. Some cadres in the Ministry of Communications said, "Everyone has to go through the socialist pass, work is done by everyone, and we are all responsible for rectification." Some people compiled a "jingle" saying: "The determination to rectify is great, review after the rectification, sift through it three or four times, plug loopholes and correct errors, complete it in one go without being verbose, group rectification and group review, the three major tendencies have nowhere to hide."

In order to eliminate the lagging phenomenon in rectification, many organs have taken measures to strengthen leadership and mobilize the masses to find solutions. The Ministry of Agriculture was affected by its preoccupation with business and a lack of rectification methods in the previous period, which affected rectification. Recently, the person in charge of leading the rectification in the ministry has been strengthened, and the leaders of each bureau have also personally taken action. The person in charge of the party committee has gone deep into each bureau to conduct inspections. Some work during the day and carry out rectification in the evening, so that the movement has quickly unfolded. The Ministry of Health showed procrastination in the rectification work in the previous period. At the same time, the leadership only wanted to "hold the watermelon," trying to solve big problems at once, ignoring general rectification, resulting in a slow movement. Recently, the ministry has reversed this situation and launched a climax of rectification. The Ministry of Coal Industry has three lagging units and has recently adjusted its leadership. The ministry requires them to work overtime and seize the opportunity to catch up with the rectification work.

According to the inspection of the Party Committee of the Central State Organs, the important reason for the lagging of the rectification movement is the wrong method, chaotic steps, and failure to mobilize the masses to take the "easy first, difficult later" method to concentrate their efforts on general rectification, which made the movement slow to progress. Even now, there are still a few units that do not pay attention to the experience already gained by most organs. Some emphasize that the situation in their own organs is "special" and "hold on to the watermelon" refusing to dismount; some hold on to the watermelon and grab sesame seeds at the same time, trying to do everything at once, resulting in chaotic steps; some even mistakenly emphasize that they should "gain advantage by striking later," waiting for the experience of others, causing the mass movement to lose a favorable opportunity. The actual situation has proven that these practices are a manifestation of subjectivism that does not start from the demands of the masses. Failure to reverse this quickly will be detrimental to the development of the current rectification movement.

    九十四万多条意见结果如何？
　　国家机关组织群众复查整改情况
    及时纠正整改不彻底现象　三个坏主义再无藏身之处
    新华社17日讯　中央国家机关为了抓紧时机又多又快又好地进行整改，最近正在广泛地组织群众对整改进行复查，并且推动整改落后的单位，迎头赶上。
    根据统计，中央国家机关在这次大鸣大放中，群众共提出了九十四万多条批评意见和改进工作的建议，这些意见触及到领导机关三个坏主义的各个方面。现在，三分之二以上的单位整改运动已经形成高潮，收到了显著的效果。但是运动发展并不平衡，到12月上旬的检查，有三百多个司局一级的单位整改不到30％，这些单位没有抓紧时机，运动处在一种落后的状态。特别是还发现有六个司局单位在群众鸣放之后即冷落下来，大量的批评意见领导上一条也未改。
    检查中还发现，在已经改了的问题中，“夹生饭”现象和整改不当以及虚假情况，在一部分单位中还相当严重地存在着。造成这种现象的根本原因是某些领导干部在整风运动中依然表现了一种官僚主义的作风。
    各机关注意到，为了推动整风运动迅速而健康的发展，抓紧检查，抓紧对落后单位的领导，成为当前使整风运动更加深入的一个重要环节。
    运动发展较快的工业、交通和财贸系统各单位，最近大都对整改进行了复查，有的单位发动群众全面进行检查。冶金工业部在整改进入高潮之后，发现有的单位整改质量不高，有的问题领导上简单地“解释”一下就算改了；有的被当作“参考”意见，不认真进行处理；有的干脆推给别的部门去处理。例如黑色冶金设计院钢铁科有二十八条批评科长分工不清的意见，科内未作研究就“转院体制小组解决”。冶金设备科一位科长未经大家讨论，自己一次处理了九十六条有关干部作风的问题，大笔一挥都写上
  “已参考注意”。群众对这种官僚主义的态度表示非常不满。为了纠正这些情况，这个部采取了措施：部整风领导小组进行抽查，各司局领导小组普遍进行检查，同时发动群众普遍复查。财政部有的单位组织群众分片普查，在复查中发动群众讨论“你提的意见有那些没有得到解决？那些问题处理得不满意？有些什么问题应该改进而还没有提出？”通过这种讨论，群众不仅检查了整改质量不高的现象，而且继续进行了鸣放。
    交通部水运设计院在整改中为了防漏纠错，提高整改质量，采取了领导与群众相结合的普查方法，并且提出“检查、监督、鸣放”结合进行，这样既推动了整改，又鼓励了深入鸣放。这个设计院所属的船舶分院群众在复查时，批评一位科长在联系群众方面“态度还是生硬”，要求认真改进。这个分院通过复查，群众又提出了有关工资不合理、某些领导干部职责范围不清等十八条意见。
    从进入12月中旬以来，对整改的复查工作差不多已在各个机关普遍展开。有的机关并且专门划定一个复查的时间，不少单位还通过机关职工代表会议来进行检查。有的单位在检查中，群众贴出了大字报，批评整改中的官僚主义作风和整改不合理的现象。这种群众性的检查运动，实际上形成了又一次的批评运动。建筑工程部有人贴出一张题为“不要赞誉过早”的大字报，尖锐地批评部长在整改中简单的“就事论事”的检讨，指出有的问题解释得不能令人满意，有的“没有接触到问题的实质”。大字报要求这位部长不要只用“美好的诺言”来对待群众的批评。在这种严格的批评和督促下，这位部长认真地进行了整改，在三天内亲自处理了近百条意见。
    经过群众的监督和检查，整改中的不彻底现象及时纠正了，群众非常满意。交通部有的干部说：“社会主义关大家都要过，工作是大家做的，整改要我们大家负责。”有的人编了“顺口溜”说：“整改决心大，改后又复查，三番二次过过箩，堵漏纠错，一气呵成不罗嗦，群改又群查，三大主义无处躲”。
    为了消除整改的落后现象，许多机关已经采取了措施，加强了领导，并且发动群众想办法。农业部前一个时期由于忙于业务和整改办法不多，使整改受到影响，最近这个部“挂帅”领导整改的人加强了，各司局也都由领导人亲自动手，党委负责人深入各司局进行检查，有的白天工作，晚上便进行整改，使运动很快展开。卫生部前一个时期整改工作表现拖拉，同时领导上只想“抱西瓜”，企图一下解决大问题，忽视一般整改，结果运动迟缓。最近这个部已经扭转了这种情况，掀起了整改高潮。煤炭工业部有三个落后单位，最近已经调整了领导力量，部里要求它们加班加点抓紧时机，使整改工作迎头赶上。
    根据中央国家机关党委的检查，整改运动落后的重要原因是方法不对头，步伐混乱，没有发动群众采取“先易后难”的方法来集中力量进行一般整改，这样就使运动迟迟不前。直到现在，也还有少数单位不重视大多数机关已经取得的经验，它们有的强调本机关情况“特殊”，“抱住西瓜”不肯下马；有的又抱西瓜又抓芝麻，眉毛胡子一把抓，步伐混乱；有的甚至错误地强调要“后发制人”，等待别人的经验，使群众运动失掉有利时机。实际情况已经证明，这些作法都是不从群众要求出发的一种主观主义的表现，不迅速扭转，对当前整风运动的发展是不利的。
