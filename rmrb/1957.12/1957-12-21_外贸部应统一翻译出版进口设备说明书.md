    The Ministry of Foreign Trade Should Unify the Translation and Publication of Imported Equipment Manuals
    Equipment manuals are the primary technical data for guiding equipment installation, adjustment, and rational use. Our country imports a considerable amount of equipment from abroad. Because there is no unified organization to plan and organize the translation and publication of these foreign equipment manuals, some manuals are translated and published repeatedly, resulting in a waste of manpower and resources, while some manuals are not translated, especially those from countries like Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Hungary. Because manuals cannot be supplied in a timely manner, the installation and commissioning of equipment is affected, and the equipment is even subjected to damage that could be completely avoided. For example, the Sifang Rolling Stock Plant of the First Ministry of Machine Building installed a Polish vertical milling machine, but because there was no Chinese manual and they did not know how to use it, it was delayed for seven or eight months before it could be put into production. The Qiqihar Rolling Stock Plant has a large Polish-made radial drilling machine, but because there was no Chinese manual to guide them, improper use led to the gears being broken four times, seriously affecting the precision of the machine tool. Similar situations are numerous and too many to mention. These lessons illustrate the importance of translating and publishing equipment manuals for maintaining state fixed assets and extending equipment life. The State Council once instructed that the translation, publication, and supply of foreign equipment manuals should be planned, organized, and managed uniformly by the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and agreed to increase their staffing. However, the Ministry of Foreign Trade only convened two or three meetings with the relevant departments, emphasized some difficulties, and only agreed to do organizational work, not translation and publication work. Many units hope that the Ministry of Foreign Trade will take comprehensive charge of this matter, but more than a year has passed, and the Ministry of Foreign Trade has not expressed its attitude, and it seems they want to let it drop.
    We believe that the State Council's designation of the Ministry of Foreign Trade to undertake this task is entirely correct because: Firstly, the Ministry of Foreign Trade knows the models and quantities of imported equipment, and can know which equipment manuals need to be translated and how many copies should be published. Moreover, when signing equipment ordering contracts, they can ask the manufacturing countries for manuals, translate and publish them in advance, so that when the equipment arrives in China, Chinese manuals can be supplied in a timely manner, without affecting installation and use. Secondly, currently, equipment is imported from countries such as the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Poland, and Hungary. If each department prepares such a set of translators to translate the manuals, but the workload is not large, it will inevitably lead to a waste of personnel and resources. Only centralized and unified management is the most economical and rational. Moreover, due to business relations, the Ministry of Foreign Trade has cadres who are familiar with the languages of various countries, and if necessary, they can be supplemented by transfers from other departments, which is not a big problem. Therefore, it is possible and necessary for the Ministry of Foreign Trade to uniformly plan, organize, and manage the translation and publication of foreign equipment manuals. Why is the Ministry of Foreign Trade not implementing the State Council's instructions? We hope they will conduct a thorough review and quickly resolve this issue.

    外贸部应统一翻译出版进口设备说明书
    设备说明书是指导设备安装、调整和合理使用的主要技术资料。我国由国外供应的设备相当多，由于对这些国外设备说明书的翻译出版，没有统一的机构来计划和组织，以致有些说明书翻译出版重复，造成了不少人力物力的浪费，而有些说明书则无人翻译，尤其是德、捷、波、匈等国家的。因为说明书不能及时供应，就影响设备的安装和投入生产，甚至使设备遭受到完全可以避免的损坏。例如第一机械工业部的四方机车车辆厂安装了一台波兰立式铣床，因为没有中文说明书，不会使用，延迟了七、八个月才投入生产。齐齐哈尔机车车辆厂有一台波兰制造的大摇臂钻床，因为没有中文说明书指导，使用不当，曾先后四次打坏齿轮，严重地影响了机床的精密度。诸如此类的情况很多，不胜枚举。从这些教训中，说明了设备说明书的翻译出版工作对维护国家的固定资产，延长设备寿命，是具有多么重要的意义。国务院曾指示过，国外设备说明书的翻译出版供应工作由外贸部统一计划组织管理，并同意他们增加编制。但外贸部只召集各有关部开了二、三次会议，强调了些困难，仅仅同意做组织工作，不同意做翻译出版工作。很多单位都希望外贸部还要全面的抓起来，可是事隔一年多，外贸部始终没有表示态度，看样子他们是想不了了之了。
    我们认为国务院指定外贸部来负担此项任务完全是正确的。因为：第一，外贸部掌握设备进口的型号及台数，可以知道需要翻译那些设备说明书，出版数量多少，而且在签订设备订货合同时，就向制造国家要说明书，预先翻译出版，当设备到达国内时，就可及时供应中文说明书，不致影响安装和使用。第二，目前进口设备的有苏、捷、德、波、匈等国家，如果各个部门都准备这样一套翻译人员来翻译说明书，而工作量不大，一定会造成人员窝工浪费，只有集中起来统一管理最经济合理。而且外贸部因业务关系、熟悉各国文字的干部都有，必要时可由其它部门抽调补充，问题不大。所以，外贸部统一计划组织管理国外设备说明书的翻译出版工作，是可能的，也是应该的，外贸部为什么不执行国务院的指示，希望能很好的检查一下，并迅速解决这个问题。
