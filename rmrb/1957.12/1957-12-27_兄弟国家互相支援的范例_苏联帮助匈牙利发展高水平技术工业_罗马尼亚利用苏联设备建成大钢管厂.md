Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 26th December - Hungarian Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Apro, published an article in "People's Free Newspaper" on the 25th, discussing the recent Soviet-Hungarian agreement signed in Moscow on Soviet economic and technical assistance to Hungary.

Apro pointed out that, according to the agreement, Soviet economic and technical assistance will enable Hungary to effectively change its industrial structure, to first develop industries that require fewer raw materials and have high technical requirements (such as telecommunications equipment and instrument industries), and to improve technical standards as much as possible, and widely apply modern technology.

Apro said that the Soviet Union has agreed to provide Hungary with basic construction loans of up to 300 million rubles at an annual interest rate of 2%. From 1958 to 1963, the Soviet Union will supply Hungary with various industrial equipment under this loan. Apro pointed out that Hungary will strictly focus on using Soviet assistance to develop the production of telecommunications equipment, instruments, and diesel engines, and focus on developing and expanding some factories, replacing new machines, and continuing to complete some construction projects.

Apro said that with the help of the Soviet Union, Hungary will no longer export aluminum ingots in the future, but export semi-finished or finished aluminum products, and will build cold-rolling and hot-rolling mills at the Danube Steel Plant. In addition, Hungary will further develop the construction, oil extraction, textile, paper, metallurgy, and chemical industries.

Apro said that the design and research departments and factories of Hungary and the Soviet Union will conduct direct contact and directly exchange experience and information. The Soviet Union has decided to provide Hungary with the latest achievements researched by Soviet experts in several industrial production sectors.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 26th December - A giant steel pipe manufacturing plant in Roman, Romania, has been put into production on December 24.

The products produced by this factory will not only be able to fully meet the needs of the domestic oil, gas and chemical industries for seamless steel pipes in the future, but can also be exported to other countries.

Romanian Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Heavy Industry, G. Popa, pointed out at the celebration of the factory's opening that the complex and state-of-the-art equipment of this steel pipe manufacturing plant was all supplied by the Soviet Union under preferential conditions. This is a vivid example of the selfless assistance given to Romania by the great friend, the Soviet Union.

On the eve of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Romanian People's Republic (December 30), good news of new enterprises being put into production has also come from other regions of the country. A silicate brick factory in Galati State has been put into production. A joint enterprise including an oxygen manufacturing plant and an oil equipment repair plant newly built in Pitesti State has been completed. Some new mines in Rovinari State and Craiova State have also begun production.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 26th December - At present, Romania's machinery manufacturing industry has been able to supply more than three-quarters of the machinery and equipment needed by various departments of the national economy. The backward state in which Romania relied almost entirely on imports of machinery and equipment before liberation has been fundamentally changed.

The machinery manufacturing industry is an industrial sector that was established in Romania after liberation. However, in just over a decade, this industrial sector has been able to produce hundreds of types of mining equipment, petroleum industry equipment, lathes, tractors, trucks, steam turbines, and eighty types of agricultural machines.

In recent years, the output of various machinery and equipment has increased significantly. For example, this year the production of tractors has increased to 19 times that of ten years ago, lathes have increased to eight times that of seven years ago, trucks have increased to 7.5 times that of three years ago, buses have increased to 2.6 times that of two years ago, ball bearings have increased to 380 times that of 1949, and agricultural machines have increased to three times that of 1956. Last year, the total output value of the machinery manufacturing industry increased to 3.6 times that of 1950. Due to the rapid development of the machinery manufacturing industry, its proportion in the entire industry has increased from 7.1% in 1950 to 12% in 1956.

    兄弟国家互相支援的范例
    苏联帮助匈牙利发展高水平技术工业
    罗马尼亚利用苏联设备建成大钢管厂
    新华社布达佩斯26日电　匈牙利部长会议副主席奥普罗25日在“人民自由报”上发表文章，谈苏匈两国最近在莫斯科签订的苏联给予匈牙利经济和技术援助的协定。
    奥普罗指出，根据协定，苏联在经济上和技术上的援助将使匈牙利有效地改变工业结构，来首先发展原料需要少、技术要求高的工业（如电讯器材和仪器工业等），并尽可能地提高技术水平，广泛应用现代技术。
    奥普罗说，苏联答应给匈牙利三亿卢布以内的基本建设贷款，年利为2％。在1958—1963年间，苏联将在这一贷款项下供给匈牙利各种工业设备。奥普罗指出，匈牙利将严格地集中使用苏联的援助来发展电讯器材、仪器和柴油发动机等的生产，集中发展和扩建一些工厂，更换新机器和继续完成一些建设项目。
    奥普罗说，在苏联的帮助下，匈牙利将来可以不再出口铝锭，而出口铝的半成品或成品，将建成多瑙钢铁厂的冷轧、热轧厂。此外，匈牙利将进一步发展建筑、采油、纺织、造纸、冶金、化学等工业。
    奥普罗说，匈牙利和苏联的设计和研究部门以及工厂将进行直接联系，直接交流经验和资料。苏联已决定把苏联专家在几个工业生产部门研究出的最新成果供给匈牙利。
    新华社布加勒斯特26日电　罗马尼亚罗曼市的一座巨型钢管制造厂已经在12月24日投入生产。
    这个工厂生产的产品将来不仅能够充分满足国内石油、煤气和化学工业对无缝钢管的需要，而且还可以向其他国家输出。
    罗马尼亚部长会议副主席、重工业部长格·波帕在庆祝工厂开工生产的大会上指出，这个钢管制造厂的复杂的、最新式的设备全是苏联在优惠条件下供给的。这是伟大朋友苏联给予罗马尼亚无私援助的鲜明例证。
    在罗马尼亚人民共和国成立十周年（12月30日）前夕，国内其他地区也传来了新企业投入生产的喜讯。加拉齐州的一个矽酸盐砖制造厂已经开工生产。彼特什蒂州新建的一个包括氧气制造厂和石油设备修配厂的联合企业已经竣工。罗维纳里州和克拉约发州的一些新矿井也开始生产了。
    新华社布加勒斯特26日电　目前罗马尼亚的机器制造业已经能够供应国民经济各部门所需的四分之三以上的机器设备。解放前罗马尼亚几乎全部机器设备依赖进口的落后状态已经从根本上改变了。
    机器制造业是罗马尼亚解放以后才建立起来的工业部门。但是在短短十多年中，这个工业部门已经能够生产几百种采矿设备、石油工业设备、车床、拖拉机、载重汽车、蒸汽涡轮机，以及八十种农业机器。
    几年来，各种机器设备的产量增加得十分显著。例如，今年拖拉机的生产量增加到了十年前的十九倍，车床增加到七年前的八倍，载重汽车增加到三年前的七点五倍，公共汽车增加到两年前的二点六倍，滚珠轴承增加到1949年的三百八十倍，农业机器增加到1956年的三倍。去年，机器制造业的总产量增加到了1950年的三点六倍。由于机器制造业的迅速发展，它在整个工业中所占的比重已经从1950年的7.1％增加到1956年的12％。
