　　Burmese Deputy Prime Minister U Ba Swe

　　U Ba Swe was born on October 7, 1915, in Aung Pin Kwin village, about fifty miles from Dawei Township. His parents, U Tun Lai and Daw Pwa Latt, were both merchants.

　　He studied at Dawei National High School and later entered university in 1936 from Dawei Public High School. Before entering university, U Ba Swe led a student strike in Dawei to support the famous university boycott movement of 1936. During this strike, he came into contact with national strike leaders, paving the way for his participation in national politics when he continued his studies at Yangon University.

　　At university, U Ba Swe was in charge of the "Peacock's Voice" magazine published by the Yangon University Student Union. He also participated in the "Red Dragon Reading Club." While still a student at university in 1938, U Ba Swe, along with the late Thakin Ba Swe, led the famous oil workers' march from Yenangyaung to Yangon. Later, in 1939, he served as the General Secretary of the All Burma Students' Union.

　　He left university in 1940 to participate in national political life, but soon returned to the university to serve as Chairman of the Yangon University Student Union (1940-41) and actively participated in the work of the People's Revolutionary Party. He was one of the founders of this party when it was established in 1939. U Ba Swe also actively participated in organizing the work of the famous Thirty Comrades who went to Japan for military training.

　　During the Japanese occupation of Burma in 1942, he initially served as the Executive Committee member of the People's Revolutionary Party in Dawei Township. Later, during the period of 1942-45, he went to Yangon to serve as the captain of the Civil Defense Force. He was also secretly one of the leaders of the Anti-Fascist Organization.

　　In 1944, as one of the leaders of the anti-Japanese movement, U Ba Swe was responsible for the movement in the Yangon, Hmawbi, and Hlegu areas. He was arrested by the Japanese and imprisoned for twenty-four days, but through the efforts of U Nu and others, he was later released on April 24, 1945. After his release, U Ba Swe continued to stay in Yangon and played an active and responsible role in the recovery of Yangon on May 1, 1945.

　　On September 1, 1945, U Ba Swe, as one of the most active leaders of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League, served as the Chairman of the Socialist Party, formerly known as the People's Revolutionary Party, with U Kyaw Nyein as the secretary. Later, Thakin Mya became the chairman, and U Ba Swe served as the general secretary. In 1947, when the late Aung San and others went to Britain, U Ba Swe served as the General Secretary of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League, a position he held until he became the Vice Chairman of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League in 1952.

　　Since the Trade Union Congress (Burma) was established in 1948, U Ba Swe has been serving as its chairman. In the 1952 general election, U Ba Swe was elected in the Taikkyi constituency and joined the cabinet as Minister of Defense, and later as Minister of Mines. In 1953, U Ba Swe was elected as the chairman of the newly established Asian Socialist Conference.

　　In the 1956 general election, U Ba Swe was elected in the Lanmadaw constituency of Yangon. He succeeded U Nu as the Prime Minister of the Union of Burma. When U Nu reassumed the position of Prime Minister in February 1957, U Ba Swe remained as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.

　　U Ba Swe married Daw Nu Nu, the daughter of a large mine owner from Dawei, in 1942 and has eight children.
