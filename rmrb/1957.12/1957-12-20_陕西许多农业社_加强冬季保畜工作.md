Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, December 19th: Agricultural cooperatives in various parts of Shaanxi are strengthening their winter livestock protection efforts. Recently, in the Liuchi, Jiuyuan, and Leifeng townships of Fuxian County, over 700 feeding rooms in agricultural cooperatives have added doors and windows, and over 200 feeding rooms have built soft sheds for livestock. The entire county has stored over 1,800 jin of grass for each large animal. In the Dazhuang, Zhenyuan, and Chengguan townships of Wugong County, over 30 feeding rooms have added 190 warm water pots and 380 grass curtains. After classifying livestock in Zhenyuan and Daijia townships, over 270 old, weak, and sick animals have been separated for feeding.

The Shaanxi Provincial Animal Husbandry Bureau dispatched over 90 cadres to over 40 counties in November to assist with livestock protection work. Wugong, Lantian, Fuxian, Heyang, and Xi'an have recently organized livestock appraisals or held meetings of feeding team leaders and feeders to exchange livestock protection experiences. Fuxian County also organized over 30 traditional Chinese veterinary doctors to conduct livestock inspections in agricultural cooperatives. (Attached picture)

    加强冬季保畜工作
    新华社西安19日电　陕西各地农业社加强冬季保畜工作。最近，鄜县柳池、九原、雷丰三个乡的农业社有七百多个饲养室增设了门窗，两百多个饲养室为牲畜搭起了软棚。全县为每条大家畜贮备下一千八百多斤草。武功县的大庄乡、贞元乡和城关镇有三十多个饲养室增设了一百九十口温水锅和三百八十多个草帘。贞元乡和戴家乡对牲畜进行分类排队之后，将二百七十多头老、弱、病畜加以分槽喂养。
    陕西省省畜牧局在11月间就派出九十多名干部分赴四十多个县帮助进行保畜工作。武功、蓝田、鄜县、郃阳和西安市最近都组织了牲畜评比，或召开了饲养队长、饲养员会议交流保畜经验。鄜县还组织了三十多个中兽医到农业社进行了牲畜检查。（附图片）
