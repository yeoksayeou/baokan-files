Xinhua News Agency, 22nd. The Ministry of National Defense has directed the entire army to cancel the current regulations in the Chinese People's Liberation Army regarding the issuance of multi-child allowances to officers, effective January 1st of next year.

When the People's Liberation Army implemented the supply system in the past, the living expenses of officers' family members and children who were approved to accompany them were borne by the army. In January 1955, after officers switched to a salary system, the leadership of the troops, considering that officers could not have savings during the supply system period, and that some officers had many children, stipulated that allowances be given to officers with many children in order to avoid difficulties in their family life. In the past year, many officers with more children have requested the cancellation or modification of this regulation in order to reduce the burden on the state, and many of them have already voluntarily stopped receiving this allowance. After several months of investigation and research, the Financial Department of the General Logistics Department of the People's Liberation Army believes that a frugal family style has been cultivated among officers, and that in the three years since the implementation of the salary system, most people have accumulated some savings, more or less, and the difficulty of supporting their families has been greatly reduced. Therefore, the conditions for canceling this regulation are ripe, and it was immediately reported to the Ministry of National Defense for approval to cancel it.

### 国防部指示全军  取消军官多子女补助费

    国防部指示全军
    取消军官多子女补助费
    新华社22日讯  中国人民解放军部队中现行的发给军官多子女补助费的规定，国防部已指示全军从明年1月1日起取消。
    解放军部队在过去实行供给制度的时候，经批准随队的军官家属及其子女的生活费等，统由军队负担。1955年1月，军官改行薪金制度后，部队领导机关考虑到军官在供给制度时期内不可能有积蓄，部分军官的子女又多，为了不使他们的家庭生活发生困难，曾规定对子女多的军官给予补助。最近一年来，有不少子女较多的军官为了减轻国家负担，纷纷请求取消或修改这项规定，其中有许多人已经自动不领取这项补助费。解放军总后勤部财务部经过几个月的调查研究以后，认为在军官中已养成勤俭持家的风气，而且实行薪金制以后的三年来，多数人或多或少有了一些积蓄，赡养家属的困难已大大减少，因此取消这项规定的条件已经成熟，随即报请国防部批准取消。
