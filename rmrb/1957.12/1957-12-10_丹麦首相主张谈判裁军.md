　　Danish Prime Minister Advocates Negotiated Disarmament

    Xinhua News Agency, Copenhagen, December 9th: Danish Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Hansen delivered a speech at the annual meeting of the Copenhagen Journalists Association on December 8th, advocating negotiated disarmament and the easing of international tensions.

    He said, "The fact that artificial celestial bodies can now be launched into interstellar space 1,500 kilometers away shows us the height that science and technology have reached... I believe that we have never felt such an urgent need to have the leaders of the world consider their responsibilities, and let them declare that they should negotiate, strive to reach disarmament agreements, ease tensions, and seek mutual understanding between countries."
