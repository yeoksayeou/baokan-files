    Recently, this reporter visited the Lhasa Transportation Station.

    In the station's plaza, vehicles came and went in an endless stream. Many trucks loaded with supplies drove out of the plaza gate, heading for Shigatse, Gyantse, Phari, Yatung, and other places. Then several buses drove in, bringing herders from various tribes on the northern Tibetan grasslands. They brought hundreds of bundles of mutton and butter to Lhasa to exchange for daily necessities. Countless Buddhists, wearing festive costumes, supported the old and led the young as they traveled by bus from all parts of Tibet to Lhasa to worship Buddha.

    The Lhasa Transportation Station currently undertakes the transportation task for more than 3,000 kilometers of highways. The vehicles dispatched by this station transport thousands of tons of supplies from the interior to Tibet and transport timber from southeastern Tibet, mineral sands from northern Tibet, and some local specialty products to various towns along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway.

    Currently, the Tibetan plateau is in the season of ice and snow. Although the severe cold has brought many difficulties to highway transportation, it cannot stop the operation of vehicles. On the highways of Tibet, more than 3,000 meters above sea level, cars are still traveling as usual. They cross glaciers and snow-capped mountains, pass through sparsely populated valleys and grasslands, and bring supplies and passengers to their destinations. The person in charge of the transportation station said that in the past five months, more than 3,500 vehicles were dispatched from this transportation station, transporting nearly 10,000 tons of grain, department stores, and various construction equipment from Qinghai, Gansu, and other places, ensuring the normal progress of construction in Tibet during the winter. In the past, some people said that the roads in Tibet were: "January, February, March, mountains are blocked by snow, wanting to travel, it's difficult, difficult, difficult." However, the more than 200 drivers at this transportation station overcame difficulties with strong will and completed their tasks. They said, "January, February, March, mountains are blocked by snow, as long as we go, no matter how difficult it is!"

    Now, this station receives batches of Tibetan guests every day, and more and more Tibetan guests are coming to take the bus. This reporter saw an old man from a pastoral area in northern Tibet getting off the bus, taking out a pure white "hada" from his arms and respectfully hanging it on the front of the car. He told others that in the past, it took him more than twenty days to ride a horse from Heihe to Lhasa. Now, the car only takes two days to bring him to Lhasa.

### 冰川雪岭只等闲

    冰川雪岭只等闲
    新华社记者　郭超
    最近记者访问了拉萨运输总站。
    在车站的广场上，来来往往的车辆，络绎不绝。许多辆满载物资的卡车从广场驶出大门，开向日喀则、江孜、帕里、亚东等地。接着又开进来几辆客车，这些客车带来了藏北草原上各个部落的牧民，他们带着上百包羊肉和酥油到拉萨来换取生活用品。无数佛教徒，穿着节日服饰，扶老携幼地从西藏各地乘车到拉萨朝佛。
    拉萨运输站目前担负着三千多公里长度的公路线的运输任务。由这个车站派出的车辆，把成千上万吨物资从内地源源运到西藏，又把西藏东南部的木材和藏北的矿砂以及部分土特产品运到青藏公路沿线的各个城镇。
    目前，西藏高原正是冰封雪冻的季节。严寒虽然给公路运输带来了很多困难，但阻挡不住车辆的运行。在西藏拔海三千公尺以上的公路线上，汽车照常在行进，它们越过冰川和雪岭，走过人烟稀少的山谷和草地，把物资和乘客带到目的地。运输站的负责人说，在最近的五个月中，由这个运输站里派出了三千五百多车次的汽车，从青海、甘肃等地运来了将近一万吨的粮食、百货和各种建设器材，保证了西藏冬季建设的照常进行。过去，有人说西藏的公路是：一、二、三（月），雪封山，想通车，难上难。但是，这个运输站的二百多名驾驶员用坚强的意志克服了困难，完成了任务。他们说：“一、二、三，雪封山，只要走，哪怕难？”
    现在，这个车站每天都要接待一批批藏族客人，来搭车的藏族客人愈来愈多了。记者看到，一位从藏北牧区来拉萨的老人下车以后，从怀里掏出一根洁白的“哈达”恭恭敬敬地挂到汽车头上，他告诉别人说，过去他从黑河到拉萨，骑马得走二十多天，现在，汽车只用两天的时间便把他带到了拉萨。
