    Celestial Music and "Final Echo"
    The chairman of the U.S. National Committee for the International Geophysical Year, Kaplan, recently published an article in the American "National Geographic Magazine" saying that the sound of the Soviet artificial satellite in the sky, like a xylophone, is a kind of celestial music, emanating from the most unusual celestial body. "This music should only exist in the heavens," this American scientist can be considered a connoisseur.
    However, in the United States, there are some people who maliciously curse the signals sent by the Soviet satellite as "monotonous." For them, perhaps the "boom—pada" sound of the American Vanguard is the "final echo".

    仙乐和“绝响”
    美国国际地球物理年委员会主席卡普兰最近在美国“全国地理月刊”上发表文章说：苏联人造卫星在天空发出的像木琴的声音，是一种仙乐，是最不寻常的星体上发出来的。“此曲只应天上有”，这位美国科学家亦可以算是知音了。
    但是在美国却另外有一些人，他们恶意咒骂苏联卫星发出的讯号“单调”。对于他们来说，大概美国先锋号发出的“轰隆——叭哒”的声音才是“绝响”。
