The Peaceful Transformation of the Bourgeoisie is a Success

Judging from the situation in the past two years, the Party's policy of peaceful transformation of the bourgeoisie is correct and successful.

First, the state has achieved the goal of changing capitalist ownership into socialist ownership. After the realization of overall public-private partnership and the fixed interest system, public-private joint ventures are basically socialist enterprises. It can be said that China's capitalist economic system has been eliminated, and the socialist economic system has been basically established. The decisive victory of the socialist revolution not only eliminated the exploitation system that had existed for thousands of years, but also affected many social strata such as intellectuals, religious circles, ethnic minorities, and democratic parties. This is a very profound and broad change in the political and economic life of the country. In this great change, because we earnestly implemented the Party Central Committee's policy of peaceful transformation and carried out the above-mentioned work, there were no obstacles in material production and commodity circulation, and the equipment of enterprises was not damaged; and because the social productive forces were liberated, the enthusiasm of employees was greatly improved, which promoted the development of production. According to statistics from the State Statistical Bureau, the output value of newly added public-private joint venture industries in 1956 increased by 42.4% compared with 1955, and the total retail sales of public-private joint ventures, cooperative commerce, and private commerce in 1956 increased by 15.2% compared with 1955.

Second, from the perspective of class relations, during the high tide, the bourgeoisie handed over the means of production and the economic front. Because the Party and the state promptly carried out the above-mentioned series of unity and education work, their emotions quickly stabilized. Therefore, many capitalists, after being assigned work, played a role to a certain extent in their production technology and business management knowledge, and played a role in the production and operation of enterprises. At the same time, due to work arrangements, theoretical education, labor competitions, and especially the development of the rectification movement, the bourgeoisie has been further transformed into laborers, and the prerequisite conditions and a good start have been obtained.

The Reactionary Nature of the Capitalist Stand

Although our socialist transformation of industry and commerce, handicrafts, and agriculture has achieved a decisive victory, it does not mean that there are no problems. In the class relations of our country during the transition period, the bourgeoisie occupies an important position. Although the petty-bourgeois peasants and individual handicraftsmen are all laborers, their aspect as private owners leads to this class. Therefore, the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the working class for the leadership of individual laborers runs through the entire transition period. Every struggle made by the working class against the bourgeoisie contains this meaning. After the high tide of transformation, due to the victory of the socialist revolution on the economic front, the struggle between the two roads is prominently and concentratedly manifested in politics and ideology. This is reflected in the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the working class for the leadership of peasants and handicraftsmen, and it will of course be expressed more and more prominently in politics and ideology. Therefore, in the current nationwide rectification movement, the rectification of the industrial and commercial circles and the rectification of the handicraftsmen also have closely related significance.

The high tide of socialist transformation was a major turning point in China's political life. The role and status of the capitalist economy before and after the high tide underwent fundamental changes. Before the high tide, the capitalist economy had a positive aspect that was conducive to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and a negative aspect that was unfavorable to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Therefore, the state's policy towards capitalism was to use its positive aspects, limit its negative aspects, and gradually transform it into a socialist economy. After the high tide, the work of transforming the capitalist economy into a socialist economy has been basically completed, and the capitalist economy no longer has a positive aspect, that is, it has no need to exist. In this case, if people continue to adhere to the capitalist stand and attempt to restore the capitalist economy, it would be to make socialism regress to capitalism and make history regress, so the capitalist political stand has become reactionary after the high tide.

So, in what aspects is the reactionary nature of the capitalist stand manifested? According to the situation in the period before the rectification, the manifestations of the reactionary capitalist stand can be summarized as follows: (1) Some people in the industrial and commercial circles verbally admit that socialism is good, but when encountering specific problems, they exaggerate the shortcomings of the socialist economy and try to beautify the capitalist economy as much as possible. They say that the capitalist economy has profit as a driving force and has flexibility in production and operation, unlike the planned economy which is rigid. This approach is to support socialism verbally and abstractly, but in fact and specifically, it opposes socialism and fundamentally negates the socialist system. (2) Some people in the industrial and commercial circles are not convinced by the leadership of the working class, and believe that the working class has nothing to learn. In particular, they feel very resistant to the leadership and supervision of the workers in their own factories and stores. (3) Some people in the industrial and commercial circles are nostalgic for the autocratic management methods of the capitalist period and oppose collective leadership; they believe that collective leadership is the reason why private personnel have positions but no power. They are even more unconvinced by the public representatives promoted from the employees of their own factories and stores. They say: "Laymen cannot lead experts." Therefore, they demand the abolition of the public representative system. (4) Some people in the industrial and commercial circles applied for joint ventures during the high tide, but after the joint venture was realized, they were not convinced in their hearts, so they demanded to withdraw from the public-private joint venture. If they could not withdraw, they would "pretend to be public for private gain," "combine public and private for private gain," "embezzle and steal," and practice "socialism during the day and capitalism at night." This way of turning back is directly destroying the achievements of socialist transformation. (5) Some people in the industrial and commercial circles deny the two-sidedness of the bourgeoisie and deliberately blur the class boundaries in order to resist ideological transformation. Because they only ask for encouragement and not criticism, they only want to hear "wealth" and do not want to hear transformation. (6) Some people in the industrial and commercial circles, starting from greedy demands, distort the redemption policy, saying that fixed interest is not exploitation, demanding fixed interest for ten or twenty years, and also demanding a one-time payment, so that there is neither the name of exploitation nor the reality of exploitation. This is a way to gain both fame and fortune. (7) Some people in the industrial and commercial circles are nostalgic for the capitalist way of life and the past decadent life, so they say that the new society is very monotonous and that "the present is not as good as the past." (8) Some people in the industrial and commercial circles viciously slander and attack the leftists, attack progressive backbone elements, and undermine the prestige of the Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. (9) Some people in the industrial and commercial circles oppose the basic policies of the state, worship the United States and oppose the Soviet Union, oppose unified purchase and sales, and oppose the five major movements, especially the "Five-Anti" movement. (10) Some people in the industrial and commercial circles slander the socialist system for not having democracy and freedom, and demand bourgeois democracy and freedom. Some people even fantasize about a change of dynasty and hope that the Communist Party will collapse. These manifestations of the reactionary nature of the capitalist political stand are concentrated in opposing the socialist system and opposing the leadership of the Communist Party and the working class. This stand is undoubtedly opposed to the socialist road of our people.

The capitalist stand is obviously reactionary, but the bourgeoisie has two sides. Moreover, because the bourgeoisie is currently in a state of intense political division, we cannot regard the bourgeoisie as a monolithic iron plate or a stone. We must combine class analysis with the political differentiation within this class to observe. The rightists among them concentratedly represent this reactionary capitalist stand and adhere to this reactionary stand, attempting to restore capitalism. They have no positive side; they only have a reactionary, dark, and negative side. The leftists among them have already stood on the socialist stand in politics, that is, the stand of the working class, firmly support the leadership of the Communist Party, and firmly take the socialist road. They basically have no negative side, only a positive side. The above two types of people are only a minority. The largest part of the industrial and commercial circles is the middle-of-the-roaders. Their characteristic is that they have varying degrees of two-sidedness in their political stand. On the one hand, they tend to accept the leadership of the Communist Party and are willing to take the socialist road to varying degrees; but on the other hand, they have not basically abandoned the capitalist political stand. They are not completely convinced about handing over enterprises, about socialism, and about the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party, and they are still nostalgic for capitalism.

In response to this situation, this year we launched a rectification movement in the industrial and commercial circles, with the educational content of opposing bourgeois rightists, breaking the capitalist stand, and establishing the socialist stand. The rectification movement in the industrial and commercial circles includes two contents: the anti-rightist struggle and the general rectification. The anti-rightist struggle is to resolve the contradiction between the enemy and ourselves, while the general rectification is to resolve the contradiction within the people. At present, this movement has been deeply developed in various parts of the country. Some cities have begun to shift to the general rectification movement. After the struggle, the rightists have been basically discredited and isolated; the middle-of-the-roaders are beginning to change; and the leftists have been tempered and improved in the movement. For the vast industrial and commercial circles, it is still necessary to carry out socialist education in the rectification movement to solve the issue of stand.

Correctly Handle the Relationship Between the State and Small Commodity Producers

After the high tide of the three major socialist transformations, because the small commodity economy has not been finally eliminated, and the small commodity economy is constantly, frequently, and spontaneously generating capitalism every day and every hour, we need to correctly handle the relationship with small commodity producers and need to struggle against the spontaneous forces of capitalism. Handling this relationship and struggling against spontaneous forces is both a struggle on the political and ideological front and a struggle on the economic front. Carrying out this struggle will still be a problem that cannot be ignored in our country for a considerable period of time in the future.

Since the second half of 1956, the spontaneous forces of capitalism have developed to varying degrees in various cities, and once formed a small countercurrent of capitalism. This spontaneous force is concentratedly manifested in the rapid increase in self-employed industrial households and unlicensed vendors. According to incomplete statistics from sixteen large and medium-sized cities including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Chongqing, Shenyang, Xi'an, Jinan, Qingdao, Chengdu, Harbin, Guiyang, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Zhengzhou, the number of self-employed industrial households has developed to more than 57,000, with nearly 120,000 people. Among these self-employed industrial households, about 25% were left over from before the high tide, and about 75% were newly developed. The number of unlicensed vendors in these sixteen cities has also reached more than 158,000, most of whom also developed after the high tide, especially after the opening of the free market. It is worth noting that some of these self-employed households have changed from individual economies to capitalist enterprises. In Shanghai, for example, capitalist enterprises account for about 17% of self-employed industrial households. In Beijing, Tianjin, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Wuxi and other places, they also account for 3% to 12.5%. In general, the situation of individual vendors changing to capitalism is not as serious as that of industrial households. However, this tendency cannot be ignored. Some small vendors have also become large vendors. Zhao Zili, an unlicensed vendor in Harbin, already has 50,000 yuan in capital, employs more than 20 people, and has set up five secret warehouses to engage in illegal activities. Yang Xiuying, a female merchant in Lixian County, Gansu Province, has developed her capital from 300 yuan to tens of thousands of yuan. She has established bases in major cities in the northwest provinces and Chongqing, Tianjin, Chengdu, Wuhan, Guangzhou, etc., and has equipped herself with assistants. She is known as the "Guerrilla Commander" among the merchants (the relevant areas have dealt with the above two people). During this period, traveling merchants and intermediaries (middlemen) have also developed. Speculative and illegal activities have also increased.

In the development of self-employed households, there is another situation that must arouse our serious attention. That is: some agricultural cooperatives and farmers do not engage in agricultural production but engage in commercial activities; some private personnel of public-private joint venture enterprises, and even some employees and members of handicraft cooperatives (groups), in order to seek huge profits and obtain high salaries, actually demand to withdraw from public-private joint venture enterprises and cooperatives (groups), and take the capitalist road back. Some have openly withdrawn, or have been poached to engage in the activities of unlicensed industrial and commercial households, and some are "socialism during the day and capitalism at night"; some are hanging the signboard of socialism, but engaging in capitalist operations. In particular, under the domination and influence of serious capitalist ideas, some private personnel and cooperative members spread reactionary remarks that undermine the consolidation of joint venture enterprises and cooperatives, saying that "joint venture is not as good as cooperation, cooperation is not as good as individual work, and individual work is not as good as black households," praising the "benefits" of individual work as: "no study, no tax, more money, no tiredness, freedom and no meetings," therefore, demanding "opening the cage and releasing the birds."

The development of capitalist spontaneous forces has already aroused the attention of party and government leaders in various places. Various places have strengthened market management in conjunction with the nationwide rectification, rectified and reorganized self-employed households, and have initially achieved positive results. Capitalist spontaneous forces have been restricted and attacked to a certain extent. But we must also see the other side of the problem. Although capitalist spontaneous forces have been restricted and attacked, the growth of spontaneous forces has not completely stopped. Taking Guangzhou as an example, after the city rectified and reorganized self-employed industrial households in June this year, it added another 2,184 households by September; in Wuxi, capitalist self-employed industrial households only numbered 85 in the second quarter of this year, but by the third quarter, they had developed to 147 households. This shows that the struggle between capitalist spontaneous forces and us is very tenacious. If we ignore this tenacity, we will make mistakes.

In order to correctly handle the relationship between the state and small commodity producers and to struggle against the spontaneous forces of capitalism, we must have a comprehensive understanding of them. We must recognize both the two-sidedness of small commodity production and its long-term and inevitable existence.

Under China's specific conditions, the existence of the small commodity economy has both a positive side that is beneficial to socialism and a negative side that is detrimental to socialism. The positive effect of the small commodity economy on socialism is mainly due to its characteristics of being flexible, convenient, diverse, and highly adaptable in production and operation. They can generally change the variety of production and operation according to changes in market demand for small commodities, "whatever you want, we have it"; in the repair service industry, they can renovate and repair old things, "repair them as soon as they come," and "be there whenever you call"; in the use of raw materials, they can use waste products and small materials. All of these can play a certain supplementary role to the socialist economy. In addition, the existence of the small commodity economy also has a certain positive effect on appropriately solving the problem of labor employment in some cities. The negative effects of the small commodity economy on socialism are mainly due to the private nature of the small commodity economy, its blindness and speculation in production and operation, and its capitalist spontaneous tendency. Some small producers rush to buy raw materials, purchase first- and second-category materials at high prices, make exorbitant profits, produce shoddy products, and engage in deception and fraud. These behaviors not only conflict with the requirements of the planned development of the national economy, but also seriously affect the stability of the market order and damage the interests of consumers. Not only that, especially some small producers poach employees of socialist enterprises, members of handicraft cooperatives, and agricultural population, and induce them to take the capitalist road back, "combine public and private for private gain," steal state property, and do everything possible to engage in illegal activities that undermine the foundation of socialism. All of these cannot but directly affect the consolidation of the socialist transformation cause. The two-sidedness of the small commodity economy is an objective fact. Denying the two-sidedness of the small commodity economy, whether one-sidedly emphasizing its positive role or emphasizing its negative role, is incorrect. Of course, this two-sidedness of the small commodity economy is specifically reflected in each household, which is different. Some households have a larger positive role; some households have a larger negative role. At the same time, it is also different at different times, places, and conditions. In short, we must comprehensively analyze and prevent one-sidedness.

After we have clarified the two-sidedness of the small commodity economy, we should further recognize the long-term nature of the small commodity economy that will continue to exist for a considerable period of time.

Everyone is clear that our country is a large country with a population of more than 600 million, but industrial and agricultural production is relatively backward, and the needs of the people are diverse. In this case, the socialist economy should and can only concentrate its main forces on developing modern industrial and agricultural production, and fundamentally meet the needs of the people. It is impossible to meet the needs of the people for all small commodities and sporadic repair services in a short period of time, nor is it possible to directly incorporate all small commodity production and circulation into the track of the national plan. Therefore, it is inevitable that some people will engage in production and sales under the leadership of the state to make up for the deficiencies of the socialist economy. At the same time, it should also be seen that the state cannot completely take over the problem of social employment in a short period of time, so some people will engage in the production and sales of some small commodities as a way to make a living. These situations show that the small commodity economy may exist for a considerable period of time.

The high tide of socialist transformation fundamentally changed the nature of the ownership of basic means of production, but the three major transformations cannot completely eliminate the small commodity economy all at once, and the existence of the small commodity economy is the breeding ground for the spontaneous forces of capitalism. Our country was originally a society dominated by small commodity production, and this habitual force still has a profound influence on people's thinking. It is also difficult to eliminate the influence of this habitual force in a short period of time. Although the socio-economic status of the bourgeoisie has now changed, most people's capitalist stand and ideology have not been completely changed. These are the social roots of the long-term existence and development of the small commodity economy and the generation of capitalist spontaneous forces.

Our analysis of the development of spontaneous forces and our affirmation of the two-sidedness of the small commodity economy and its long-term existence are by no means to encourage the development of spontaneous forces, or to let us be left to our own devices and abandon the struggle, but to recognize, on the basis of comprehensive analysis, that handling the relationship between the state and small commodity producers and struggling against the spontaneous forces of capitalism is a long-term and complex task. It is necessary to overcome the erroneous view that the capitalist spontaneous forces are no longer harmful after the socialist transformation has achieved a decisive victory. At the same time, we must also overcome the erroneous idea and practice of trying to completely block the small commodity production in a short period of time.

Requirements for General Rectification in Industrial and Commercial Circles

The main target of the general rectification in the industrial and commercial circles is the 85% of the middle-of-the-roaders in the industrial and commercial circles, because their political stand has not basically changed. The purpose of the rectification for them is to overcome their wavering between the socialist stand and the capitalist stand, to draw a clear line with the rightists politically and ideologically, and to resolutely take the socialist road. Therefore, the general rectification in the industrial and commercial circles should follow the formula of "unity-criticism-unity," carry out criticism and self-criticism gradually and deeply in a gentle and friendly manner. Of course, the leftists should also seek progress in the rectification in order to consolidate their political stand and improve their work style. As for small industrialists and merchants, generally speaking, they are both laborers and private owners. Some of them have some minor exploitation and have a spontaneous tendency towards capitalism. In terms of economic status and working conditions, they are both different from the employees and also different from the bourgeois elements. Therefore, the principle for the rectification of small industrialists and merchants must be education-oriented. Through education, change their original political stand, criticize the capitalist spontaneous tendencies, correct the relationship between the individual, the collective, and the state, accept the leadership of the Party, and take the socialist road. When carrying out socialist education specifically, we should also adapt to the characteristics of small industrialists and merchants, and ensure that both rectification and business are not affected. At the same time, on the basis of carrying out socialist education for them, we should establish regular political and ideological education work for small industrialists and merchants.

Regarding the attitude towards unlicensed industrial and commercial households, according to its two-sidedness and long-term nature, we adopt the policy of "utilizing, restricting, and transforming," as well as the principle of "prohibiting underground factories" and "the underground should become above ground." We must carry out effective management and supervision of them, and also do a good job in education and guidance. We must not only fully utilize their positive role, but also struggle against their capitalist spontaneous tendencies and speculative and illegal activities and other negative and destructive behaviors, so that the small commodity economy is placed under the leadership, supervision, and management of the state, and truly plays its supplementary role to the socialist economy, and gradually incorporates them into the track of socialist transformation. For this purpose, some places are now conducting reviews and reorganizations of them. After review and reorganization, some will be retained and some will be eliminated. We believe that this method is necessary. Among the part of the industrial and commercial households that are allowed to exist, we should strengthen supervision of the minority that are capitalist enterprises and actively carry out socialist transformation; for individual households, we should do a good job in education and management, strictly restrict their development towards capitalism, and gradually incorporate them into the track of cooperation according to the conditions.

Now, I would like to raise the following questions for the comrades of the handicraft cooperatives to pay attention to:

(1) During the high tide of full-scale public-private joint venture in 1957, about 15,000 private industrial enterprises across the country took the road of cooperation. Therefore, there are some small owners and capitalists in the handicraft cooperatives. Under the current circumstances, it is inappropriate to carry out class divisions and distinguish their class components in the cooperatives. However, due to their different socio-economic status, there are generally varying degrees of capitalist tendencies, and they may directly bring capitalist influences to the cooperatives. We hope that the comrades of the cooperatives will strengthen the education and transformation work for them, especially in this rectification movement, through large-scale airing of views, big debates, and severely criticize their capitalist tendencies. We should struggle against and give necessary punishment to the few who take the lead in asking to withdraw from the cooperative, which affects the consolidation of the cooperative, and those who abandon the work of the cooperative and are keen on running the free market and engaging in "underground factories."

(2) Due to the capitalist habits in the ideology of the vast majority of members, due to the fact that the bourgeoisie will still exist for a period of time, and due to the fact that individual handicraft households will continue to exist for a relatively long period of time, and due to the influence of these factors, the tendency to turn back in the handicraft cooperatives cannot be completely eliminated overnight or by one or two movements. This situation requires us to continue to strengthen the ideological transformation work of the bourgeois elements; it requires us to strengthen the education of individual handicraftsmen from the aspects of market management and administrative management. Here, we hope that the handicraft departments will constantly strengthen the socialist education of the members, especially the small owners and capitalists, on the basis of the rectification movement, and persevere in the political and ideological work on a regular basis.

(3) The collectively owned handicraft cooperative is one of the important economic forces for the state to struggle against the spontaneous forces of capitalism in society. Therefore, we hope that the handicraft cooperatives will further improve business management, improve product quality, stabilize product prices, improve service attitudes, facilitate the needs of residents, and overcome the weaknesses in the old business management style. In this way, it will become a powerful assistant to the state-owned economy in developing production and ensuring supply. At the same time, because it fully exerts the superiority of the socialist economy, it can economically plug loopholes and restrict the development of capitalist spontaneous forces.

(4) The collectively owned cooperative economy is also an important material basis for the state to transform the individual economy. The existing handicraft cooperatives also have the task of assisting the government in uniting, educating, and transforming individual handicraft households. We hope that the handicraft production cooperatives will improve their business management, implement the principle of running the cooperatives diligently and thriftily, and constantly attract individual handicraft households to embark on the road of socialist transformation more quickly with the significant superiority of the socialist economy. Secondly, handicraft cooperatives and individual handicraft households have certain connections with the free market in terms of raw material procurement and product sales. There are also certain interactions between handicraft cooperatives and individual industrial households in business operations. Therefore, we hope that the handicraft cooperatives will become models of abiding by state administrative management and market management laws, leading individual handicraft households to abide by state laws, and at the same time assisting the government in uniting, educating, and transforming them.

    当前对资本主义工商业改造工作的一些情况和问题
    国务院第八办公室副主任兼中央工商行政管理局局长许涤新在全国手工业合作社第一次社员代表大会上的讲话（摘要）
    对资产阶级的和平改造是成功的
    根据两年来的情况看起来，党对资产阶级的和平改造政策是正确的，是成功的。
    首先，国家达到了改变资本主义所有制为社会主义所有制的目的。在实现全面公私合营和定息制度之后，公私合营企业基本上已经是社会主义性质的企业。可以说，我国资本主义经济制度已经消灭，社会主义经济制度已经基本上建立了。社会主义革命的决定性的胜利，不但消灭了存在几千年的剥削制度，而且影响到知识分子、宗教界、少数民族、民主党派等许多社会阶层。在国家政治经济生活中，这是非常深刻和广泛的变革。在这一巨大变革中，由于我们认真的贯彻了党中央和平改造的政策，进行了上述工作，在物质生产和商品流通方面没有发生障碍，在企业的设备方面没有受到破坏；而因为社会生产力的解放，职工积极性大大提高，推动了生产的发展。根据国家统计局的统计，1956年新增的公私合营工业的产值，比1955年产值增加42.4％，公私合营、合作化商业和私营商业1956年的零售总数比1955年增加15.2％。
    其次，从阶级关系来看，在高潮中，资产阶级交出了生产资料，交出了经济阵地。由于党和国家及时地进行了上述一系列的团结教育工作，使他们的情绪迅速地稳定下来。因此，许多资方人员在安排工作之后，在一定程度上发挥了他们的生产技术和经营管理知识，对企业的生产经营发挥了作用。同时，由于工作安排、理论教育、劳动竞赛，特别是整风运动的开展，使资产阶级分子进一步改造为劳动者，得到了前提条件和良好的开端。
    资本主义立场的反动性
    我国对工商业、手工业、农业的社会主义改造，虽然已经取得了决定性的胜利，但并不是就没有问题了。在我国过渡时期的阶级关系中，资产阶级居有重要的地位。小资产阶级的农民和个体手工业者虽然都是劳动者，但他们作为私有者的一面是通向这个阶级的。因此，资产阶级同工人阶级争夺个体劳动者领导权的斗争也贯穿了整个过渡时期。工人阶级向资产阶级所作每一个斗争中，都包含着这种意义。在改造高潮之后，由于经济战线上社会主义革命的胜利，两条道路的斗争，突出地、集中地表现在政治上、思想上。这反映在资产阶级同工人阶级争夺农民和手工业者领导权的斗争上，也当然会更多地更突出地从政治上和思想上表现出来。因此，在当前全民整风的运动中，工商界的整风和手工业者的整风，也有着息息相关的意义。
    社会主义改造高潮，是我国政治生活中的一个重大转折点。资本主义经济在高潮以前和高潮以后的作用和地位产生了根本的变化。在高潮以前，资本主义经济具有有利于国计民生的积极性一面和不利于国计民生消极性一面。因此，国家对资本主义的政策，是利用它的积极性，限制它的消极性，逐步把它改造成为社会主义经济。高潮之后，资本主义经济改造成为社会主义经济的工作，已经基本完成，资本主义经济就不再具有积极性了，也就是没有存在的必要了。在这种情况下，人们如果继续坚持资本主义立场，企图恢复资本主义经济，那就是要使社会主义向资本主义倒退，使历史倒退，所以资本主义的政治立场，在高潮以后已经变成反动的了。
    那末，资本主义立场的反动性，表现在哪些方面呢？根据整风以前一个时期的情况来说，资本主义反动立场的表现可以归纳为如下几点：（1）工商界中有些人口头上承认社会主义是好的，但遇到具体问题，就夸大社会主义经济的缺点，尽量美化资本主义经济。他们说资本主义经济有利润作动力，在生产经营上有灵活性，不像计划经济那样死板。这种做法就是在口头上、在抽象方面拥护社会主义，而在事实上、在具体方面，反对社会主义的做法，从根本上否定社会主义制度的做法。（2）工商界中有些人对工人阶级的领导不服气，认为工人阶级是没有什么可学习的。特别对本厂本店工人的领导和监督，感觉到十分抵触。（3）工商界中有些人留恋资本主义时期的独断独行的经营管理方式，反对集体领导；认为集体领导就是私方人员有职无权的原因。他们对于从本厂本店职工提拔的公方代表，更不服气。他们说：“外行不能领导内行”，因此，要求取消公方代表制度。（4）工商界中，有人虽然在高潮时申请合营，但在实现合营以后，心中不服，因而要求退出公私合营，退不成就“假公济私”，“合公营私”，“贪污盗窃”，“白天社会主义，晚上资本主义”。这种走回头路的办法，是直接地在破坏社会主义改造的成果。（5）工商界中有人否认资产阶级的两面性，故意混淆阶级界限，以达到抗拒思想改造的目的。因为他们只要求鼓励，不要求批评，只愿听“财富”，不愿听改造。（6）工商界中有人从贪得无餍的要求出发，歪曲赎买政策，说定息不是剥削，要求定息十年二十年，还要一次付清，既无剥削之名，又得到剥削之实，这是名利双收的办法。（7）工商界中有人留恋资本主义的生活方式，留恋过去腐朽糜烂的生活，因此，说新社会很单调，“今不如昔”。（8）工商界中有人恶毒地诬蔑攻击左派，打击进步骨干分子，破坏民建会、工商联的威信。（9）工商界中有人反对国家的基本政策，崇美、反苏，反对统购统销，反对五大运动，特别是“五反”运动。（10）工商界中有人诋毁社会主义制度没有民主自由，要求资产阶级的民主自由，有的人甚至幻想变天，希望共产党垮台。资本主义政治立场反动性的这些表现，集中起来就是反对社会主义制度、反对共产党和工人阶级的领导。这种立场，无疑是同我国人民的社会主义道路对立的。
    资本主义立场明显地是反动的，但资产阶级有两面性，并且，由于资产阶级在政治上目前正处于激烈分化的情况下，因此，我们不能把资产阶级看做一块铁板，一块石头，必须把阶级分析，同这个阶级内部的政治分野相结合来观察。他们中的右派分子，集中地代表了这种反动的资本主义立场，并且坚持这种反动立场，企图使资本主义复辟。他们是没有积极性的一面；只有反动的阴暗的消极的一面。他们中的左派分子，在政治上已经站住了社会主义立场，即工人阶级的立场，坚决拥护共产党的领导，坚决走社会主义道路。他们基本上没有消极性的一面，只有积极的一面了。以上这两种人都只是少数，工商界人数最多的一部分是中间分子。他们的特点是在政治立场上具有不同程度的两面性，一方面在不同程度上倾向于接受共产党的领导，愿意走社会主义道路；但是另一方面，基本上还没有抛弃资本主义政治立场，对于交出企业，对于社会主义，对工人阶级和共产党的领导，并不完全心服，对资本主义还有留恋。
    针对这种情况，今年我们在工商界全面开展了一个以反对资产阶级右派，破资本主义立场、立社会主义立场为教育内容的整风运动。工商界的整风运动，包含着反右斗争和一般整风两个内容。反右斗争是解决敌我矛盾，而一般整风则是解决人民内部矛盾。目前这个运动已在全国各地深入开展。有些城市已开始转入一般整风运动。经过斗争，右派分子已经基本上被斗臭、被孤立了；中间分子开始在变化；左派分子在运动中受到锻炼，得到提高。对于广大工商界来说，还需要在整风运动中进行社会主义教育，解决立场问题。
    正确处理国家同小商品生产者之间的关系
    社会主义三大改造高潮以后，由于小商品经济并未最后被消灭，而小商品经济是不断地、经常地、每日每时自发地在产生着资本主义的，这就需要我们正确地去处理同小商品生产者之间的关系，需要与资本主义自发势力作斗争。处理这种关系和与自发势力作斗争，既是政治、思想战线的斗争，也是经济战线的斗争。进行这种斗争，将仍然是我国今后在一个相当长的时间内不可忽视的问题。
    1956年下半年以来，资本主义自发势力，在各城市有不同程度的发展，一度曾经形成了一小股资本主义的逆流。这种自发势力，集中地表现为自发工业户和无证商贩的迅速增加。据北京、天津、上海、广州、武汉、重庆、沈阳、西安、济南、青岛、成都、哈尔滨、贵阳、无锡、苏州、郑州等十六个大中城市的不完整统计，自发工业户已发展到五万七千多户，近十二万人，在这部分自发工业户中，有25％左右是高潮前遗留下来的，75％左右都是新发展的。这十六个城市的无证商贩也达十五万八千多人，大部分也是在高潮以后，特别是自由市场开放以后发展的。值得注意的是，在这些自发户中，一部分已经从个体经济变为资本主义性质的企业。像上海市，自发工业户中，资本主义性质的企业约占17％，北京、天津、武汉、广州、无锡等地，也占到3％到12.5％。在小商贩中，由个体变为资本主义的情况，一般说，没有工业户严重。但是，这种倾向也是不可忽视的，有些小商贩也已经变成了大商贩。哈尔滨市有一个无证商贩赵子礼，已经有五万元资金，雇用了二十多人，还设立了五个秘密仓库，从事非法活动；甘肃省礼县的女行商杨秀英，资金从三百元发展到了几万元，在西北各省及重庆、天津、成都、武汉、广州等大城市中，都设有据点，配备了助手，在行商中被称为“游击司令”（有关地区，对上述二人已作了处理）。在这个时期中，行商、中间人（居间人）也有所发展。投机违法活动也增加了。
    在自发户的发展中，还有一个情况必须引起我们的严重注意。这就是：一些农业社和农民不搞农业生产而从事商业活动；一些公私合营企业的私方人员，甚至一些职工和手工业合作社（组）的社员，为了牟取厚利，获得高额薪金，竟要求退出公私合营企业、合作社（组），走资本主义的回头路，有的人已经公然退出，或者被挖走，进行无证工商户的活动，有的是“白天社会主义，晚上资本主义”；有的挂着社会主义的招牌，而从事资本主义的经营。尤其是，有一些私方人员和合作社社员，在严重的资本主义思想的支配和影响下，散布着破坏合营企业、合作社巩固的反动言论，说什么：“合营不如合作，合作不如单干，单干不如黑户”，颂扬单干的“好处”是：“不学习、不拿税、挣钱多、不吃累、自由自在不开会”，因此，要求“开笼、放鸟”。
    资本主义自发势力的发展，已经引起了各地党政领导的注意，各地已经结合全民整风，加强了市场管理，对自发户进行了清理整顿工作，并且已经初步收到了积极的效果。资本主义自发势力在一定程度上已经受到了限制、打击。但是我们还必须看到问题的另一方面。资本主义自发势力虽然受到了限制、打击，但自发势力的滋长并没有完全停止。以广州为例，该市自今年6月份对自发工业户进行清理整顿以后，到9月份，又增加了二千一百八十四户；无锡市的资本主义性质的自发工业户，今年二季度还只有八十五户，到三季度，已经发展为一百四十七户。这就说明，资本主义自发势力同我们的斗争，是十分顽强的，忽视这种顽强性，我们就会犯错误。
    为了正确地处理国家同小商品生产者之间的关系，同资本主义自发势力进行斗争。我们必须对它们有一个全面的认识，既要认识小商品生产的二面性，又要认识它们存在的长期性和必然性。
    在我国的具体条件下，小商品经济的存在，既有有利于社会主义的积极作用的一面，也有不利于社会主义的消极作用的一面。小商品经济对于社会主义的积极作用，主要由于它们在生产经营上具有机动、灵活、方便、多样，以及由此而产生的适应性强的特点。它们一般能根据市场对小商品的需要的变化，改变生产和经营的品种，“要啥有啥”；在修理服务行业上，可以翻新补旧，“随来随修”，“随叫随到”；在使用原料上，可以利用废品、小料。所有这些，对社会主义经济可以起到一定的补充作用。此外，小商品经济的存在，对于适当地解决一部分城市的劳动就业问题，也有一定的积极作用。小商品经济对社会主义的消极作用，主要由于小商品经济的私人性质，它在生产经营上的盲目性、投机性和它的资本主义自发倾向。一些小生产者抢购原材料，套购一、二类物资，抬价暴利，粗制滥造，欺骗作假等行为，不仅同国民经济有计划发展的要求发生矛盾，也严重地影响着市场秩序的稳定，损害着消费者的利益。不仅如此，特别是有些小生产者挖雇社会主义企业的职工、手工业合作社的社员和农业人口，引诱他们走资本主义的回头路，“合公营私”，盗窃国家财产，千方百计地进行挖社会主义墙脚的违法活动。所有这些，就不能不直接地影响着社会主义改造事业的巩固。小商品经济的二面性，是客观存在的事实。否认小商品经济的二面性，如果片面地强调其积极作用，或者强调它的消极作用，都是不正确的。当然，小商品经济的这种二面性，具体地反映在每一户上面，是有所不同的，有的户积极作用大一些；有的户消极作用大一些。同时，在不同的时间、地点和条件下，也是有所不同的。总之，我们必须全面分析，防止片面性。
    我们在明确了小商品经济的二面性之后，还应该进一步认识小商品经济在相当长的时期内还会存在的长期性。
    大家都很清楚，我国是一个有六亿多人口的大国，但是工农业生产比较落后，而人民的需要却是多种多样的。在这种情况下，社会主义经济应该也只能集中主要力量来发展现代工农业生产，从根本方面来满足人民的需要，而不可能在短期内就满足人民对所有小商品和零星修理服务的各种各样的需要，也不可能把全部小商品生产和流通都直接地纳入国家计划的轨道，因此，就不可避免地会有一些人在国家的领导下，从事生产和贩运，来弥补社会主义经济的不足。同时，还应该看到，国家不可能在短期内就把社会就业问题，完全包下来，因此，有些人就会从事一些小商品的生产和贩运，作为谋生之道。这些情况，说明小商品经济有可能在一个相当长的时期内存在着。
    社会主义改造高潮从根本上改变了基本生产资料所有制的性质，但是三大改造不可能一下子就完全消灭小商品经济，而小商品经济的存在，则是产生资本主义自发势力的温床。我国原来就是一个小商品生产占优势的社会，这种习惯势力在人们的思想上还有着深厚的影响，要求在短期内消灭这种习惯势力的影响，也是有困难的；现在资产阶级的社会经济地位虽然已经改变，但是，大多数人的资本主义立场和思想意识还没有彻底改变。这些，都是小商品经济在一个长时期内存在、发展和产生资本主义自发势力的社会根源。
    我们分析自发势力的发展情况，肯定小商品经济的二面性及其存在的长期性，决不是为了要鼓励自发势力的发展，或者要我们放任自流、放弃斗争，而是为了在全面分析的基础上，认识到处理国家同小商品生产者之间的关系和与资本主义自发势力作斗争，是一个长期的复杂的任务。需要克服那种认为在社会主义改造已经取得决定性胜利之后，资本主义自发势力已经不足为害的错误看法，同时，也要克服那种企图在朝夕之间，把小商品生产完全堵死的错误思想和做法。
    对工商界一般整风的要求
    工商界一般整风的主要对象，是占工商界人数85％的中间分子，因为他们的政治立场基本上还未改变。对他们通过整风，就是要他们克服自己在社会主义立场和资本主义立场间的动摇性，在政治上、在思想上同右派划清界限，坚决走社会主义的道路。因此，工商界一般整风，应当按照“团结——批评——团结”的公式，和风细雨，逐步深入，开展批评与自我批评。当然，左派分子为了巩固自己的政治立场和改进工作作风，也应该在整风中求得进步。至于小型工商业者，一般说，他们既是劳动者，又是私有者，他们中有的人有一些轻微的剥削，并具有资本主义的自发倾向。他们在经济地位和劳动条件上，既和职工有所不同，又同资产阶级分子也有区别，因此，对于小型工商业者的整风的方针，必须以教育为主。通过教育，改变他们原有的政治立场，批判资本主义自发倾向，端正个人、集体和国家的关系，接受党的领导，走社会主义的道路。具体进行社会主义教育的时候，还应该适应小型工商业者的特点，要做到整风和业务两不误。同时，应该在对他们进行社会主义教育的基础上，建立对小型工商业者的经常的政治思想教育工作。
    对于无证工商户的态度，根据它的二面性和长期性，我们采取“利用、限制、改造”的政策，以及“禁止地下工厂”，“地下的应该变为地上”的方针。要对它们进行有效的管理和监督，也要做好教育和辅导工作。既要充分利用它们的积极作用，又必须同它们的资本主义自发倾向和投机违法活动等消极破坏行为作斗争，使小商品经济置于国家的领导、监督和管理之下，真正发挥其对社会主义经济的补充作用，并逐步地把它们纳入社会主义改造的轨道。为了这个目的，现在一些地方对它们进行审查、清理。经过审查清理，保留一部分、淘汰一部分。我们认为这种办法是必要的。在允许存在的一部分工商户中，对其中少数属于资本主义性质的企业，应该加强监督，积极进行社会主义改造；对个体户，应该做好教育与管理工作，严格限制其向资本主义发展，根据条件，逐步把它们纳入合作化的轨道。
    现在，提出如下几个问题，请手工业合作社的同志们加以注意：
    （一）1957年全行业公私合营高潮中，全国约有一万五千多个私营工业企业走合作化的道路。因此在手工业合作社中，有一部分小业主和资本家。在目前情况下，在合作社中进行划阶级，区别他们的阶级成分，是不适当的。但由于他们的社会经济地位不同，一般都存在着不同程度的资本主义倾向，他们有可能把资本主义影响直接地带到合作社来。我们希望合作社的同志们，加强对他们的教育改造工作，特别是在这次整风运动中，通过大鸣大放大辩论，对他们的资本主义倾向进行严肃的批判。对他们中间少数带头闹退社，使合作社的巩固遭到影响的分子，和放弃合作社工作，热中跑自由市场，搞“地下工厂”的分子，则应对他们进行斗争，并给以必要的处分。
    （二）由于广大社员思想意识中资本主义的习惯势力，由于资产阶级还将存在一个时期，由于个体手工业户也将在一个较长的时期内继续存在，由于这些因素的影响，手工业合作社内部走回头路的倾向，也不是一朝一夕或者一两次运动所能完全清除掉的。这种情况，要求我们继续加强对资产阶级分子的思想改造工作；要求我们从市场管理和行政管理方面，加强对个体手工业的教育。在这里，我们希望手工业部门在整风运动的基础上，不断地加强对社员特别是小业主和资本家的社会主义教育，把政治思想工作经常地坚持下去。
    （三）集体所有制的手工业合作社是国家同社会上资本主义自发势力进行斗争的重要经济力量之一。因此，我们希望手工业合作社，进一步改善经营管理、提高产品质量、稳定产品价格、改善服务态度、便利居民需要，克服旧的经营管理作风上的弱点。这样一来，它就会在发展生产、保证供应方面，成为国营经济的有力助手，同时，因为它充分发挥了社会主义经济的优越性，就能够从经济上堵塞漏洞，使资本主义自发势力的发展受到限制。
    （四）集体所有制的合作社经济，也是国家改造个体经济的一种重要物质基础。现有的手工业合作社，还担负有协助政府团结教育和改造个体手工业户的任务。我们希望手工业生产合作社要改善经营管理，贯彻勤俭办社的方针，以社会主义经济显著的优越性，不断吸引个体手工业户更快地走上社会主义改造的道路。其次，手工业合作社和个体手工业户在原料收购与产品销售上，与自由市场均有一定的连系，手工业合作社与个体工业户在业务经营上互相之间也有一定的往来，因此，我们希望手工业合作社成为遵守国家行政管理和市场管理法令的楷模，带动个体手工业户遵守国家法令，同时协助政府对它们进行团结、教育和改造。
