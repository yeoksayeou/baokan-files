Settling Down and Establishing a Career in the Countryside
　　——On Deputy County Chief Chen Chunhuai Returning Home to Run a Cooperative
　　By Our Reporter　Jin Feng

　　"Chunhuai, you've come back just in time!"
　　Deputy County Chief Chen Chunhuai was walking on the road back to his home (Huimaying Village, Xian County, Hebei Province). The biting spring wind of March stirred up clouds of yellow dust. But Chen Chunhuai felt a surge of warmth throughout his body.
　　As he neared the village, he heard a distant clamor of voices. It turned out that hundreds of men, women, and children from his village, hearing that he was returning home to run a cooperative, had thronged to the main road at the edge of the village to welcome him.
　　"Chunhuai, are you really back?" "Chunhuai, you've come back just in time; now our village cooperative can be run well!" "Brother Chunhuai, how long are you staying before you leave?" The crowd surged forward, surrounding him, asking questions all at once. Their faces were filled with joy, hope, and a touch of uncertainty.
　　Chunhuai, while hastily greeting everyone, quickly replied, "I've come back to work and run the cooperative with you all; how could I leave after just a few days? I'm here to stay for good."
　　After the welcome meeting, Chen Chunhuai took a tour of the village. He couldn't help but be shocked and gasp in surprise. He had only heard that his village had suffered severe disasters last year, but he hadn't realized it was this bad. Out of 153 households in the village, the flood had washed away 700 houses, leaving only twenty-odd households with undamaged homes. Now, the entire village of more than 600 people was crowded into these twenty-odd mud houses, livestock sheds, and shacks. They all looked at him with a troubled, pleading gaze. In the open fields, lay thirteen emaciated livestock – the village's entire animal power. Beneath the collapsed mud houses, lay buried and destroyed farming tools. Without livestock, tools, or fertilizer, the villagers were relying almost entirely on their bare hands to plant crops.
　　Chunhuai was in a state of turmoil. He had barely returned home and sat down when his cousin – a fifty-year-old poor peasant named Chen Chunling – came to see him: "Chunhuai," Chunling said in a low voice, struggling to move his numb lips, "I'm really in dire straits. The relief grain is all gone, and I've been lying in bed for two days."
　　"Why don't you engage in some sideline occupations?" Chunhuai quickly helped him sit down, asking gently.
　　"Others have money, but we don't have any capital. We don't even have a cart; what kind of sideline occupations can we do?!"
　　Chunhuai didn't say anything, giving him ten yuan to buy some grain first.
　　Poor peasant Zhou Guangping came in, his whole body shivering from the cold, his trousers torn, revealing a large patch of flesh. Chunhuai gave him another ten yuan.
　　One after another, people came to this small room. Chunhuai had expected this situation before he came to the village. He sold his watch, and the hundred-odd yuan quickly disappeared.
　　"This is not a sustainable solution; we must quickly organize to overcome the spring famine," Chunhuai immediately convened a meeting of the Party branch committee and the cooperative committee, deciding to first address the most pressing issues for the masses: the livelihood of impoverished households and the village's housing problem. He requested a subsidy of 1,000 yuan from the county to build houses, organizing the labor force of impoverished households into four house-building teams. Those who had money (cadres, military personnel, workers' families, and some well-to-do middle peasants) contributed funds, and those who didn't received some subsidies, first building houses for those living in livestock sheds and shacks, thereby solving the livelihood problems of impoverished households. This immediately stabilized the people's mood.

　　He was the first to jump into the water
　　Now, he focused prominently on the production issue. They had to strive for a bumper wheat harvest; they couldn't keep asking the state for grain. At the time, they needed to fight drought and irrigate the wheat. The village only had twenty wells, which wasn't enough. There was a large pit of 100 mu in the west of the village, with five or six feet of water, which could be used to irrigate 2,000 mu of land. He mobilized everyone to build channels to irrigate the wheat.
　　"This is a new thing; can we really draw water from the ground when it's not raining?" Some elderly villagers shook their heads, expressing their doubts.
　　"The weather is still cold; people can't stand in the water to work after digging out the water," Chunhuai requested the digging of two irrigation channels, five feet wide and three feet deep. Water was found at a depth of only two feet. Some well-to-do middle peasants, hoping the cooperative would collapse, refused to work properly, making all kinds of excuses.
　　"We charged into gunfire during the war; can't we stand in the water?" Chunhuai said, rolling up his trouser legs and jumping into the water first. Seeing him jump in, the cooperative cadres and members followed suit, completing five irrigation channels, more than ten li long, in two days, firing the first shot in the township's campaign to build channels and fight drought. Qimin Agricultural Production Cooperative of Huimaying Village, which had been a third-class cooperative and a backward village for several years, had recently been given a red flag to another cooperative because it failed to complete the spring sowing task. Now, it received a red flag for the first time.
　　When the water from the West Big Pit flowed into the wheat fields through the channels, Chunhuai convened a forum of veteran farmers and cooperative cadres to discuss establishing the cooperative's various systems: contracting work, contracting production, raising and using livestock, accumulating fertilizer, rewarding overproduction, finances, and work points... putting the cooperative on a normal track. He went to the fields to produce with the villagers during the day, and gathered various meetings at night to study and arrange the tasks for the next day.

　　The results of his day and night labor with the villagers were evident. This year's wheat in their village grew heavily, yielding more than 80 jin per mu (previously, this barren red land yielded at most 50 jin per mu). When the villagers were busy threshing, it rained several times in a row, and grass seedlings grew everywhere in the cornfields. Chunhuai quickly organized all the women in the village to gather and thresh wheat, and pulled out the main labor force to hoe the fields. He knew that if he didn't weed quickly, the fertilizer in the fields would soon be consumed by the grass, and the corn yield would decrease. After pulling wheat for three consecutive days, he went to hoe the fields with the strong laborers.
　　"Don't hoe anymore; I don't think you can handle it," the villagers advised him to put down the hoe. They knew that he hoed the fields during the day and stayed up late at night for meetings.
　　"I can do it; I won't fall behind if you can do it," Chunhuai gritted his teeth, keeping pace and not letting himself fall behind. On the first day, he hoed a little over one mu; on the second day, he hoed two mu, matching the performance of a strong laborer.

　　Three Red Flags
　　The Qimin Agricultural Production Cooperative of Huimaying Village had a bumper wheat harvest. This most backward cooperative in the township became the cooperative with the highest yield, and this village, which had been short of grain for eight years, became a surplus grain village in the first year, selling more than 80,000 jin of wheat to the state. The cooperative bought back more than 20 livestock, more than 40 waterwheels, and also bought weeding machines and double-wheeled double-share plows.
　　Now, the Qimin Production Cooperative is like a steed tamed by a skilled rider, galloping forward. Pest control, drought resistance, autumn harvest, wheat planting, it successively received two more red flags. In less than half a year, three red flags fluttered in the sky above Huimaying Village, and it regained the honor of being a model village (during the War of Resistance Against Japan). This cooperative also had a bumper autumn harvest, with a total grain harvest of more than 350,000 jin, exceeding the three-fixed output by 100,000 jin. The grain task (including purchase and public grain) of 150,000 jin was completed in two days, and more than 10,000 jin were delivered beyond the quota. Now, this village has changed from four shortages (shortage of grain, housing, livestock, and fertilizer) to four adequacies: surplus grain (now the cooperative, in addition to selling surplus grain, also stores seeds, fertilizer, basic construction and reserve grain totaling 140,000 jin, of which the public accumulation fund will be 50,000 jin, and the reserve grain will be stored more than 10,000 jin; in addition, it also stores more than 10,000 jin of wheat, preparing to distribute it to cooperative members for the New Year), adequate housing (180 rooms have been built, and more are being built), self-sufficient livestock (currently 55) and fertilizer.
　　Today, the members of the other cooperatives in Dongcun Township no longer dare to discuss the Huimaying Village cooperative with the same contemptuous tone as before. When going to the market, people look at the members of Huimaying Village with respectful and envious eyes as they buy livestock, farming tools, fertilizer, new mattresses for the kangs, and zippered velvet jackets for the new daughter-in-law.

　　How much effort did Chunhuai spend to run this cooperative well?
　　He felt that leading a cooperative was definitely not easier than being a deputy county chief, but rather more arduous. A cooperative, with hundreds of people and thousands of mu of land. The thinking of each cooperative member had to be specifically understood and analyzed, and no task could be ignored without ideological work. There was always a struggle between the advanced and the conservative, between individual interests and collective interests. After the wheat harvest this year, he was going to a meeting in the county, and the production captain at home was preparing to conceal production and sabotage, wanting to distribute the good wheat to the cooperative members and conceal more than 10,000 jin. After he returned, he asked each team to report their own production, which was 40,000 jin lower than the assessed production. He asked the cooperative members to discuss the relationship between individual interests and national interests, and asked each team to elect representatives to supervise each other. As a result, the actual production after threshing was more than 10,000 jin higher than the assessed production. He often used this example to educate everyone, and no grain was lost during the autumn harvest. After grasping ideological work, labor allocation was a major issue in directing production. When several agricultural tasks were crowded together, improper allocation would lead to production losses. This year, when wheat harvesting and field hoeing were squeezed together, he listened to the experienced veteran farmers and resolutely organized female labor to thresh the grain, pulling out the main labor force to hoe the fields, which resulted in an extra 20 jin of corn per mu. The soil of a neighboring village was better than their village, but because the hoeing was not timely, there was a yield reduction of 60 jin per mu. And for labor to be properly allocated, specific production experience was needed. In the past, when he was a deputy county chief, he often went to the countryside. But he mostly listened to reports from district and township cadres. At that time, he also wanted to specifically lead production, but he didn't know the main link. He also went to the fields to take a look, but it was mostly a cursory glance. As long as he saw many people in the fields, he would be happy, thinking that the enthusiasm of the cooperative members must be high. Little did he know that this might be: "A swarm of bees from afar, but working without efficiency up close," and inefficiency was the most annoying thing for cooperative members. At that time, he also promoted increased production experience, and also knew that it was necessary to adapt to local conditions, but he didn't know the specific production conditions, and he didn't have much confidence when combining them. Now that he actually participated in production, he had to know some specific ways to increase production. For example, timely cultivation is a very important point. Their corn was hoed in a timely manner, resulting in an extra yield of more than 20 jin per mu. Their beans were planted in a timely manner, resulting in an extra yield of more than a dozen jin per mu.
　　Now, Chen Chunhuai is settling down and establishing a career in the countryside, not only learning production, but also learning the skills to direct and lead production. He has also gained a lot of experience in the laws of running a cooperative.

　　The countryside is waiting for you!
　　"Who says the countryside has no future?" Chen Chunhuai seemed unable to understand why people would have such a contemptuous view of the countryside: "Our countryside gloriously supported the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation in the past. Now, in the period of socialist construction, the future of the countryside is also very bright." He talked about their cooperative's production plan for next year: to increase the yield from 200 jin per mu this year to 300 jin per mu. He calculated the account: as long as the yield is 300 jin per mu, the 3,000 mu of land in the village will have a grain income of 900,000 jin. After deducting rations, seeds, and feed, less than 400,000 jin, 500,000 jin of surplus grain can be sold; plus sideline income (roughly 300,000 jin of grain), plus a bumper harvest of jujube trees (which is 600,000 jin of grain), the annual income will reach 1.8 million jin of grain; the 600 people in the village will have an income of 3,000 jin of grain each, which is much higher than the level of local wealthy middle peasants. Even without counting the income from jujube trees, 2,000 jin per person is close to or exceeds the level of local wealthy middle peasants. And this production target is entirely possible to achieve. Their cooperative will dig 40 wells this winter and spring, and accumulate more than 10,000 cartloads of fertilizer. The problems of water conservancy and fertilizer sources are not big, and there is no lack of funds, but the labor force is very tight. There are only more than 200 male and female laborers in the cooperative. The production and construction tasks of the cooperative are large, and there are many avenues for sideline occupations: opening ditches, digging wells, digging pit mud, raising pigs, watering public vegetable gardens, feeding the cooperative's sheep, chickens, ducks, rabbits, burning kilns, weaving reed mats, fishing, managing jujube trees... how many hands are needed to take care of it all!
　　"One hundred more laborers would not be too many," Chen Chunhuai, seeing the news in the newspaper that a large number of cadres were going to the countryside to directly participate in production, expressed a warm welcome on behalf of his cooperative: "We will definitely arrange everything properly and give the heroes a place to use their talents! If you ask about the future of our cooperative: next year we will walk to the Yellow River, the year after we will definitely cross the Yellow River, and we will catch up with the Yangtze River in ten years!"

　　"I hope the comrades who are determined to go to the countryside will come to our cooperative as soon as possible," Chen Chunhuai said with a smile, "We are also preparing the local specialty – the exported fine-grained golden thread rock sugar-flavored big jujubes to entertain everyone!"

　　在农村安家立业
　　——记陈春槐副县长回家办社
　　本报记者　金凤
    “春槐，你回来得正好”！
    陈春槐副县长走在回家（河北省献县回马营村）的路上。三月料峭的春风，刮起一团团的黄土。陈春槐却觉得全身发热。
    快到村子时，远远一片人声喧哗，原来他村里几百口男女老少，听说他要回家办社，都拥到村边大道来迎接他了。
    “春槐，你真的回来了？”“春槐，你回来得正好，这下咱村社能办好了，”“春槐哥，你住几时就走？”众人一拥上来，团团围住了他，七嘴八舌的问。他们脸上满是又欢喜又带着希望又有些不放心的样子。
    春槐一面忙不迭的和大伙招呼，一面赶忙回答：“我是回来和大伙一起劳动、一起办社来了，那能住几天就走，我是老实住下不走了。”
    欢迎大会开过以后，陈春槐在村上转了一圈，他不由得大吃一惊，倒吸了口冷气。他只听说去年他村闹灾严重，还没想到竟难到这地步。全村一百五十三户，大水冲倒了七百间房子，只二十几户的住房没有冲垮。现在，全村六百多口，就挤在这二十多户的土房里，挤在牲口棚里，挤在窝棚里。他们都拿着一种为难的祈求的眼光看着他。露天地里，躺着十三头瘦弱的牲口，这就是全村所有的畜力了。倒塌的土房下，埋着砸毁了的农具。没有牲口、没有农具、没有肥料，社员几乎是全靠手种上庄稼的。
    春槐心乱如麻，刚刚回到屋里还未坐定，他的本家哥哥——一个五十多岁的老贫农陈春灵找来了：“春槐”，春灵小着声音，艰难地动着那冻得麻木的嘴唇：“我实在困难不过，救济粮已经吃完，我躺在炕上两天了。”
    “你怎么不搞些副业咧？”春槐连忙让他坐下，温和地问他。
    “人家有钱，咱没本钱，连一辆小车也没有，搞啥副业？！”
    春槐没有啃声，塞给他十元钱，让他先去量些粮食。
    贫农周光平进来了，他全身冻得直打哆嗦，裤子破得露出一大块肉。春槐又给了他十元钱。
    接二连三，人在往这间小屋走来。春槐没下乡以前也想到可能有这情况。他卖了一块表，一百多块钱很快就光了。
    “这不是办法，得赶紧组织起来度过春荒”，春槐马上召开了支委会和社委会，决定先解决当时群众最迫切的问题：困难户的生活问题和全村的住房问题。他向县里要求补助了一千元盖房款，把困难户的劳力组成了四个盖房班。家里有钱的（干部、军官、工人家属和些富裕中农）出钱，没钱的补助些款，先把住牲口棚、窝棚人家的房屋盖了起来，同时也就解决了困难户的生活问题。这一下群众的情绪安定了下来。
    他头一个跳下水去
    现在，他突出地来抓生产问题了。必须争取麦季丰收，不能老向国家伸手要粮食。当时正需要抗旱浇麦。村里只有二十眼水井，浇不过来。村西有个一百亩的大坑，存水还有五六尺深，要利用起来，能浇二千亩地。他发动大家修渠浇麦。
    “这可是个新鲜事儿，老天爷不下雨，还能打地上出水”？一些老年社员摇摇头表示将信将疑。
    “天气还冷，挖出水来人不能站在水里干活”，春槐要求挖五尺宽、三尺深的灌溉渠二道，刚挖到二尺深就见水了。一些富裕中农巴不得社要垮台，不肯好好干活，千方百计推托。
    “打仗时炮火连天还冲锋呢，水里难道就下不去”，春槐说着卷起裤腿，头一个跳下水去。社干部和社员一见他跳下去一个个也跟着干起来，两天就完成了共长十多里的灌溉渠五道，打响全乡修渠抗旱的头一炮。几年来一直是三类社、落后村的回马营村启民农业生产合作社，不久前还因为完不成春耕播种任务，给别的社扛了红旗送去，现在第一次得到一面红旗。
    当西大坑的水顺着渠道流入麦田的时候，春槐又召开了老农和社干部座谈会，商量建立起社的各项制度：包工、包产、饲养和使用牲畜、积肥、超产奖励、财务和工分……把合作社纳上正常的轨道。他白天和社员一起去田间生产，晚上就召集各种会议，研究和布置第二天的任务。
    他和社员一起白天黑夜劳动的成绩显出来了，他们村今年的麦子长得沉甸甸地，每亩地打了八十多斤（往年这种瘠贫的红土地每亩最多打五十斤）。当社员忙着打场的时候，接连下了几场雨，棒子地里草苗齐长，春槐赶紧把全村妇女都组织起来收麦打麦，把主要劳动力都抽出来耪地。他知道，要不赶紧锄草，地里的肥料很快就会让草耗去，棒子就要减产了。他在连着拔了三天麦子以后，又和壮劳动力一起去耪地。
    “你别耪了，我看你是不行了”，社员们都劝他放下锄头。他们知道他白天耪地，晚上还要熬夜开会。
    “行啊，你们能干我保险不落后”，春槐咬咬牙齿，一步紧跟一步的不让自己给拉下来。头一天他耪了一亩多一点，第二天他就耪了二亩，顶得上一个壮劳动力。
    三面红旗
    回马营村的启民农业生产合作社的小麦丰收了。这个全乡最落后的社变为产量最高的社，这个八年缺粮的社头一年变为余粮社，卖给国家八万多斤麦子。社里买回二十多头牲口，四十多辆水车，又买了锄草机和双轮双铧犁。
    现在，启民生产合作社就像一匹由一个善于驾御的骑手调弄的骏马一样，放开前蹄向前飞奔了。除虫、抗旱、收秋、种麦，又一连得了二面红旗。不到半年，三面红旗飘扬在回马营村的上空，它重新获得了（抗日战争时候）模范村的荣誉。秋季这个社又是丰收，共收粮食三十五万多斤，超过三定产量十万斤。粮食任务（连征购带公粮）十五万斤两天就完成了，还超额多交一万斤。现在，这个村已经由四缺（缺粮、缺房、缺牲口、缺肥料）变为四足了：粮食有余（现在社里除卖余粮外，还存种籽、肥料、基本建设及储备粮共十四万斤，其中公积金将有五万斤，储备粮将存一万多斤；另外还存麦子一万多斤，准备过年时分给社员），房子够住（已盖了一百八十间，还正在盖着），牲口（现有五十五头）、肥料自足。
    如今，东村乡的其他几个社的社员，再也不敢用先前那种轻蔑的口气来谈论回马营村的合作社了。赶集的时候，人们都用着尊敬而羡慕的眼光来打量回马营村的社员买牲口、买农具、买肥料、买炕上新铺的褥单和新媳妇穿的带拉链的花绒衣。
    为了搞好这个合作社春槐花费了多少力气。
    他觉得领导一个合作社决不比当一个副县长轻松，宁可说还要辛苦些。一个合作社，好几百口人，好几千亩地。每个社员的思想要具体了解和分析，那一项任务下来都不能忽略思想工作。这里时时存在着先进与保守、个人利益与集体利益的斗争。今年麦收以后，他正去县里开会，家里的生产队长就准备瞒产捣鬼，要把好麦子分给社员，还要瞒产一万多斤。他回来以后让各队自己报产，就比评产数低四万斤。他让社员讨论个人利益与国家利益的关系，又让各队选出代表，互相监场。结果打下场来实产比评产数高出一万多斤。他常常用这个例子教育大家，秋收就没丢失一颗粮食。在抓紧思想工作以后，劳力调配是指挥生产上的一个主要问题。在几种农活赶在一起的时候，调配不得当，就会在生产上吃亏。今年收麦耪地挤在一起时，他听从有经验的老农的话，坚决组织妇女劳力打场，把主要劳力抽出来耪地，这就使每亩棒子多收二十斤。邻近一个村的土质比他们村好，只因为耪的不及时，每亩少收六十斤。而劳力要调配得当，就需要有具体的生产经验。过去他当副县长时候，也经常下乡。但多是听听区乡干部汇报情况。那时也很想具体领导生产，但是要抓那个主要环节，心中没底。那时也去地里看看，但多是走马观花。只要看到地里人多，心里就很欢喜，以为社员生产情绪一定高涨。那里知道这也许正是：“远看一窝蜂，近看打窝工”，而窝工正是社员最恼火的事。那时也推广增产经验，也知道要因地制宜，可是就不知道具体的生产条件，结合起来把握不大。现在自己实际参加了生产，就得知道一些增产的具体门路。譬如耕作及时就是很重要的一条。他们的棒子耪的及时，一亩多收二十多斤。他们的豆子耩的及时，一亩又多收十几斤。
    现在，陈春槐在农村安家立业，不仅学会了生产，也学会了指挥和领导生产的本领。对办社的规律，他也体会不少。
        农村正等待着你！
    “谁说农村没有前途？”陈春槐似乎不能理解人们会有这一种看不起农村的想法：“我们的农村过去光荣地支援了抗日战争、解放战争，现在社会主义建设时期，农村的前途也光明得很。”他谈了一下他们社明年的生产规划：要在今年亩产二百斤的基础上提高到亩产三百斤。他算了一下这笔帐：只要每亩三百斤，全村三千亩土地就有九十万斤粮食收入，除去口粮、种子、饲料等不到四十万斤，还可以卖五十万斤余粮；加上副业收入（大致三十万斤粮食），再加上枣树还能丰收的话（就是六十万斤粮食），全年收入将达一百八十万斤粮食；全村六百人，每人收入将达三千斤粮食，这就大大超出当地富裕中农的水平。即使不算枣树收入的话，每人二千斤，也赶上和超过当地富裕中农的水平。而这个生产指标是完全有可能实现的。他们社今冬明春要打四十眼井，要积肥一万多车。水利和肥源的问题都不大，资金也不缺乏，就是劳力紧得很。全社男女劳力只有二百多，社里生产建设任务大了，副业的门路又多，开渠、打井、挖坑泥、养猪、浇公共菜园、喂公共畜牧场的羊、鸡、鸭、兔、烧窖、编芦席、打鱼、管理枣树……要多少双手才能侍弄得过来呵！
    “要来一百个劳力一点都不多”，陈春槐看到报上发表的大批干部要下乡直接参加生产的消息，他代表他的合作社表示十二分的欢迎：“我们一定会安排得妥妥当当，让英雄们都有用武之地！要问我们的合作社的前途：明年走到黄河边，后年一定过黄河，十年赶过长江去！”
    “希望决心下乡的同志早一点到我们社来”，陈春槐最后笑着说：“我们还准备着本村的特产——出口的细纹金丝冰糖味的大枣来招待大家哩！”（附图片）
