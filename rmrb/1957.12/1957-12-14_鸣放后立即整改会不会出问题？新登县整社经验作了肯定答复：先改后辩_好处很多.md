Will Problems Arise from Immediate Rectification After Airing Views?
The Experience of ZhengShe in Xindeng County Affirms:
Rectify First, Then Debate - Many Benefits

    This newspaper reports that the Zhejiang Daily published the experience of ZhengShe from three townships in Xindeng in a front-page article on the 10th, and wrote a short commentary, putting forward that rectification must grasp the current urgent demands of the masses, rectify first and then debate, rectification must keep up with airing views, and criticized some townships for lacking determination for rectification, insufficient momentum, and attempting to end things hastily without seriously solving problems; as well as the erroneous thoughts and practices of some cadres who one-sidedly believed that airing views was only for debate, and rectification was secondary.

    Rectify First or Debate First?

    The basic-level rectification work in Chengyang, Sanhe, and Yongchang three townships (towns) in Xindeng County, Zhejiang, on the basis of deepening airing views, closely grasped the masses' urgent demands for rectification, immediately turned to vigorous rectification, and achieved remarkable results.

    Although these three townships carried out rectification while airing views during the Great Airing and Great Blooming, many cadres still lacked a complete understanding of the meaning and purpose of rectification. Therefore, when the county party committee proposed immediately turning to vigorous rectification after airing views, many people had resistance, they believed that: ① Without first clarifying right and wrong, the masses' ideological understanding is blurred, and rectification cannot meet the requirements; ② Activists are very angry after hearing reactionary remarks and demand debate, rectification first will pour cold water on activists and make debate difficult to carry out; ③ The capitalist ideology of wealthy peasants has not been thoroughly criticized, if rectification is done first, they will become arrogant; ④ Rectification first will fuel the reactionary arrogance of some landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries, and the evil atmosphere will rise further. Another part of the comrades agreed to rectify first and then debate. The county leadership concentrated these two different opinions and handed them over to everyone for discussion. First, everyone analyzed the ideological trends of various classes after airing views from the perspective of class analysis: Poor and lower-middle peasants, accounting for about 60%, demanded rectification, about 15% demanded rectification but doubted whether we could rectify, and only 25% demanded immediate debate. Among the new and old upper-middle peasants, most people demanded rectification except for a few who were more conscious, but doubted whether it could be rectified. In general, the majority of the masses demanded rectification, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants' demands were even more urgent. Second, judging from the opinions raised in airing views, most of them are correct, and many opinions have clear boundaries of right and wrong, and there are conditions for immediate rectification. Third, judging from the effects already received from rectifying while airing views, it also confirms that only great rectification can better mobilize the masses, which is conducive to uniting the majority of the masses and conducive to current production and various tasks. Fourth, problems that cannot be distinguished between right and wrong for a while can be solved in the debate process. If some wealthy peasants continue to release some wrong remarks, and illegal landlords and rich peasant elements become arrogant, it will further expose their nature, and this can be used to better educate the poor and lower-middle peasants and the broad masses, which is conducive to the development of the Great Debate. After such debate and repeated explanations of the meaning and purpose of the movement, most comrades greatly improved their understanding of the importance of rectification, ideologically accepted the practice of rectifying first and then debating, and expressed that they must do a good job in great rectification.

    What to Rectify, How to Rectify?

    After the Great Airing and Great Blooming, the three townships raised a total of more than 47,000 opinions. Among them, some should be rectified, some need to be explained, and some need to be debated. Among the issues that should be rectified, there are also those that can be rectified immediately, and those that cannot be done for a while and need to be resolved over a longer period of time in the future. In this stage (about half a month or so), how to rectify? What to rectify? After research, these opinions were first analyzed and summarized, and the rectification committee repeatedly researched and discussed with the masses, from top to bottom and from bottom to top, and formulated a rectification plan. And while formulating the plan, action was taken, focusing on solving the following problems:

    First, first focus on solving problems that are closely related to current work. The most prominent are current agricultural production, rectification and consolidation of cooperatives, and grain issues. The masses raised many opinions on these issues. For example, in production, their biggest opinion is that the leadership does not grasp the seasons, and is always too late to act; production is not specific, and material supply is not timely, etc. The leaders of each township accepted the criticism, made self-criticisms to the masses, and immediately corrected them, and strengthened the leadership of current production. The masses of Sanhe Township criticized the grain management office for untimely supply of seeds, and 5,000 jin of broad bean seeds were transported on the third day after airing views. Within two days, 59 of the 66 production teams in Sanhe Township formulated short-term plans and labor quotas for rushing to harvest and plant. According to the statistics of nine cooperatives in Sanhe and Chengyang townships: During the rectification, 100 teams improved production management, formulated production plans and labor quotas, seven cooperatives revised "three guarantees", one cooperative summarized and announced accounts, two cooperatives arranged for difficult households, five cooperatives adjusted labor base points, five cooperatives dealt with private plots, and three cooperatives dealt with the issue of mountain forest joining the cooperative. In grain work, the main focus is on reporting actual output on the basis of the masses' self-awareness and completing the state's grain purchase tasks.

    Second, earnestly rectify the work style of cadres and improve the relationship between cadres and the masses. In airing views, the masses made sharp criticisms of cadres in these areas. For example, the masses in Sanhe Township criticized: "You call on others to save, but you only eat white rice." After research, it was immediately improved, and the Sanhe Township canteen was changed to eating two thin meals and one dry meal a day, with sweet potatoes and radishes, replacing fine grains with coarse grains. Bian Zhusheng, the head of Qinghe Cooperative in Yongchang Township, had shortcomings such as not going deep into work and not going to the more distant teams. After accepting the criticism of the masses, he immediately went to the team eight miles away to help study the work.

    Third, for those that should be rectified but cannot be acted on immediately, the main task is to formulate a rectification plan as soon as possible.

    Many Benefits of Vigorous Rectification

    The effect of vigorous rectification is very good. The main ones are: First, it fully mobilized the poor and lower-middle peasants, further improved their socialist consciousness, and cultivated activists.

    Second, it united the majority of the masses. In addition to fully mobilizing the poor and lower-middle peasants, the main task was to educate and unite a part of the middle masses, and bring them closer to the Party. According to the analysis of Chengyang Town: 53% of the new and old upper-middle peasants expressed their support for rectification. In Yongqiao Brigade, Yonghe Cooperative, Yongchang Township, twelve of the twenty-three middle elements turned into activists through rectification (including five wealthy peasants).

    Third, after vigorous rectification, it promoted deeper and more thorough airing of views, which is conducive to the development of the Great Debate. At the end of the airing stage in Yongchang Township, the masses raised a total of 9,800 opinions, and after rectification, they raised another 1,770 opinions. On the other hand, some wealthy peasants further exposed serious capitalist ideas during the rectification.

    Fourth, due to the early rectification, the problems were solved in a more timely manner, and the rectification was faster, which promoted current production and various central tasks. For example, after the masses criticized the leadership for lagging behind the seasons in grasping production, immediate measures were taken to promote this year's autumn harvest and winter planting.

    In short, practice has fully proved that the practice of rectifying first and then debating has many benefits. At this point, all cadres truly and thoroughly solved ideological problems.

### 鸣放后立即整改会不会出问题？新登县整社经验作了肯定答复：先改后辩　好处很多

　　鸣放后立即整改会不会出问题？
　　新登县整社经验作了肯定答复：
　　先改后辩　好处很多
    本报讯　浙江日报10日以头条地位发表了新登三个乡的整社经验，并写了短评，提出整改必须抓住群众当前迫切要求，先改后辩，整改一定要跟上鸣放，并批判了有些乡对整改决心不大，劲头不足，没认真解决问题，就企图草率收兵；以及有些干部片面认为鸣放仅是为了辩论，整改是次要的等等错误思想和作法。
    先改还是先辩？
    浙江新登县城阳、三合和永昌三个乡（镇）的基层整风工作在放深鸣透的基础上，紧紧抓住群众对于整改的迫切要求，立即转入大力整改，取得了显著的成绩。
    这三个乡在大鸣大放中虽然都进行边整边改，但很多干部对整改的意义和目的还缺乏完整的认识。因此当县委提出鸣放后立即转入大力整改时，许多人有抵触情绪，他们认为：①不先辩清是非，群众思想认识模糊，改了也不能满足要求；②积极分子听了反动言论以后很气愤，要求辩论，先改会给积极分子泼冷水，使辩论难以开展；③富裕农民的资本主义思想没有彻底批判，如果先改，他们会翘尾巴；④先改会助长部分地主、富农、反革命分子的反动气焰，邪气更要上升。另有一部分同志赞成先改后辩。县领导上便把这两种不同的意见集中起来交给大家讨论。首先，大家以阶级分析的观点，分析了鸣放以后各阶层的思想动向：贫农、下中农约占60％的人要求改，约有15％的人要求改但又怀疑我们能否改，要求马上辩论的只占25％。在新、老上中农中，除少数觉悟较高的人要求辩论外，大多数人是要求改，但又怀疑能不能改。总起来看，大多数群众要求改，特别是贫农、下中农的要求更为迫切。其次，从鸣放中提出的意见来看，大多数是正确的，而且有很多意见是非界限清楚，有条件马上改。第三，从边放边改中已收到的效果来看，也证实了只有大整大改才能更好地发动群众，有利于团结群众的大多数，有利于当前生产和各项工作。第四，对于一时分不清是非的问题，可以放到辩论过程中去解决。如果部分富裕农民继续放出一些错误言论，不法地主、富农分子翘尾巴，那就更加暴露了他们的本质，可以借此更好地教育贫农、下中农和广大群众，有利于大辩论的开展。经过这样的辩论和反复说明运动的意义、目的，大多数同志对整改的重要性的认识有了很大的提高，从思想上接受了先改后辩的做法，并表示一定要搞好大整大改。
    改什么，怎样改？
    经过大鸣大放，三个乡共提出四万七千多条意见。其中有的是应改的，有的是需要解释的，还有的是需要辩论的。在应改的问题中间也包括马上可以改的，一时办不到而需要今后较长时间加以解决的。在这一阶段中（约计半月左右的时间）怎样改？改哪些内容？经过研究，首先把这些意见作了分析归纳，由整改委员会到群众，自上而下、自下而上地反复研究讨论，制订出整改方案。并且边订方案边行动，抓住解决以下问题：
    第一，首先抓住解决与当前工作关系重大的问题。突出的是当前的农业生产、整顿巩固合作社和粮食问题。群众对这些问题提出了很多意见。如在生产上，他们最大的意见是领导上不掌握季节，放马后炮；生产抓得不具体，物资供应不及时等。各乡领导接受批评，都向群众作了检讨，并马上进行改正，加强对当前生产的领导。三合乡群众批评粮管所种子供应不及时，鸣放后第三天就运到蚕豆种五千斤。三合乡两天内六十六个生产队就有五十九个订出了小段计划与抢收抢种的劳动定额。据三合、城阳两乡共九个社的统计：整改中改进生产管理、制订生产计划与劳动定额的有一百个小队，修订“三包”的七个社，总结公布账目的一个社，安排困难户的二个社，调整劳动底分的五个社，处理自留地的五个社，处理山林入社问题的三个社。在粮食工作上，主要抓住在群众自觉的基础上报实产量，完成国家征购任务。
    第二，切实整顿干部作风，改善干群关系。在鸣放中，群众在这些方面对干部提出了尖锐的批评。如三合乡群众批评说：“你们号召人家节约，自己光吃白米饭”。研究后马上改进，三合乡食堂改为每天吃二稀一干，搭番薯、搭萝卜，以粗代细。永昌乡青河社社长卞竺生有工作不深入、不到较远的小队去等缺点，接受群众批评后，马上到八里路以外的小队去帮助研究工作。
    第三，对于应该改但还来不及马上行动的，主要是抓紧制订出整改方案来。
    大力整改好处很多
    大力整改的效果很好。主要的是：一，充分发动了贫农、下中农，进一步提高了他们的社会主义觉悟，培养了积极分子。
    二，团结了群众大多数。除充分的发动了贫农、下中农外，主要是教育团结了一部分中间群众，使他们靠拢了党。据城阳镇分析：新老上中农中间有53％的人对整改表示拥护。永昌乡永何社永桥大队二十三个中间分子，通过整改转为积极的有十二人（有富裕农民五人）。
    三，经过大力整改，促使鸣放更加深透，更加彻底，有利于大辩论的开展。永昌乡在鸣放阶段结束时，群众共提意见九千八百条，整改后又提出了一千七百七十条。另一方面，部分富裕农民在整改中更加暴露了严重的资本主义思想。
    四，由于提前进行了整改，问题解决的比较及时，改的快，推动了当前生产和各项中心任务。如群众批评了领导抓生产落后于季节后，立即采取了措施，推动了今年的秋收冬种。
    总之，实践中已完全证明了先改后辩的作法有很多好处。至此，全体干部真正彻底地解决了思想问题。
