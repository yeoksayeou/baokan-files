Xinhua News Agency, December 29th - According to a TASS report from London: The movement of the British public protesting against the establishment of American rocket bases in Britain and demanding East-West talks is intensifying.

    According to a report in the "Daily Worker" on the 28th, the Scottish Committee of the British Labour Party passed a resolution at a special meeting of the Executive Committee stating that the British government's plan to allow the United States to build four rocket launch pads in Scotland has aroused deep resentment among the residents of Scotland. The Executive Committee called for a broad movement across the country to "force the government to change its position on this issue."

    The General Secretary of the British Communist Party, Harry Pollitt, published an article in the "Daily Worker," calling on the workers' movement to lead the broad masses of the British people to rise up against the establishment of American bases and strive for high-level talks.

    In a letter to union members, the leaders of the National Union of Railwaymen emphasized that the proposal to establish rocket bases is aimed at the Soviet Union. The letter said: "It is time for the people of the West to rise up and stop these reckless actions." According to a report in the "Daily Worker," the Radcliffe (Lancashire) Trades Council passed a resolution protesting against the establishment of rocket launch pads in Britain. Speaking at the council meeting, Crompton said he was convinced that "if there is any country that desires peace, it is Russia."

    The London "News Chronicle" on the 28th called on Western countries to hold high-level talks with the Soviet Union. The newspaper wrote that we should not let go of even the slightest opportunity to negotiate with Russia.

Xinhua News Agency, December 29th - According to a Polish Press Agency report from Warsaw on the 28th: Some prominent figures in the West, in response to a New Year inquiry from Polish Radio regarding the prospects for peaceful coexistence, welcomed Poland's proposal to establish a region in Central Europe where no atomic weapons would be deployed.

    Kingsley Martin, editor of the British weekly "New Statesman and Nation," emphasized that Western countries should accept Poland's proposal and then take steps to neutralize Central Europe and withdraw foreign troops. Martin also advocated stopping nuclear weapons testing and halting the production of hydrogen bombs.

    Edouard Daladier, leader of the French Radical Socialist Party, said that Poland's proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone "should be studied in detail."

    Erich Ollenhauer, leader of the West German Social Democratic Party, believes that negotiations on establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone including East and West Germany, Poland, and Czechoslovakia "could be the first step towards resuming universal disarmament negotiations and easing international tensions." Ollenhauer also advocated the establishment of diplomatic relations between West Germany and Poland.

    Former Italian Prime Minister Parri also expressed support for Poland's proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. (Attached picture)

    Since the Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization indicated that it wanted to store atomic weapons and set up rocket launch pads in Europe, the French people's struggle against the American attempt to establish atomic bases in France has become more widespread. This is the entrance of the Saint-Anne Hospital in Paris, where slogans against the establishment of atomic bases in France have also appeared on the ground. (Xinhua News Agency)
