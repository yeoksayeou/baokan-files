What to Do After Retirement?
    —A Record of Conversations with Veteran Workers at the Shanxi Machine Tool Factory
    By Our Reporter Gu Ye
    On December 1st, a group of elderly workers at the Shanxi Machine Tool Factory gathered to discuss the draft "Provisional Regulations on the Handling of Retirement for Workers and Staff" issued by the State Council. They unanimously agreed that these regulations fully embodied the superiority of socialist society. Pang Yubao, a fitter, said: "My wife and I were overjoyed after hearing about these regulations, and we're even more motivated at work. The Party and the government are truly thinking of us. How many workers in the old society didn't starve in their old age?" Han Zhiguo said: "Back then, if you were just a little older, you'd be kicked out of the factory. I remember a master craftsman named Tao in Taiyuan, whose skills were the best, but he was left unattended in his old age. He had to set up a small stall by the roadside, soldering chimneys and repairing locks, and eventually starved to death. With such good skills, he died so tragically. What kind of fate awaited other old workers was clear for all to see. Now, as long as we work diligently, we don't have to worry about what to do when we get old! People say raising children is for old-age security, but these regulations are more reliable than having a good son."
    Then, Han Zhiguo, Mao Dengke, Duan Huangxi, and other workers raised some specific questions for the government to consider when formulating the implementing rules. They felt that old workers were receiving meticulous care in the new society, and many were reluctant to sit idle after reaching retirement age. They wondered if it was possible for them to voluntarily stay and work in the factory or go to nursing homes to raise chickens and pigs. They asked: What should be done with elderly workers who are single after retirement? If someone doesn't have a house in their hometown, can they continue to live in the factory dormitory after retirement? Can arrangements be made to facilitate the receipt of retirement pay and food rations for those who retire and return to their hometowns? And some people are worried that their retirement pay will not be enough to support their families (large families, young children), is it permissible to continue working in the factory?
    After raising the specific issues, everyone discussed the future prospects after retirement.
    Wu Linzhao said: "In my opinion, if a worker reaches retirement age, is still capable of working, and doesn't want to retire, and everyone thinks he can stay in the factory, then let him continue working." Pang Yubao said: "In my opinion, it's best to retire when you meet the retirement requirements. You have to know that age doesn't spare anyone! When you get older, even if you want to work, your heart is willing, but your strength is insufficient. Standing next to a machine for eight hours, you'll feel deaf, dizzy, and your hands won't obey you. The leaders and comrades will have to worry about you, fearing that you won't be able to hold on and that an accident will happen. Young people are educated, can calculate, and are physically strong. Letting them take over from us will contribute more to the country, won't it?" Wu Linzhao added: "If they can't continue their original work, let them do light work such as cleaning toilets. On the one hand, they'll get their retirement pay, and on the other hand, they'll get some extra money for doing light work. Wouldn't their lives be better?" Pang Yubao explained: "Considering individuals, their income may be less. But I've calculated it myself. My monthly income is more than 100 yuan, supporting five people. When I'm supposed to retire, some of the children can live independently, and I'll only need to support two or three people. Receiving 70% of my retirement pay will be very wealthy." Li Darong continued: "If an old worker meets the retirement requirements, and their work is indispensable due to work needs, they can stay in the factory if they volunteer; if the enterprise doesn't need them, they can go to the countryside to work, which is better." Wang Yinxi said: "The countryside needs a group of old workers to help them, and they need people to repair farm tools." Han Zhiguo interjected: "Yes, having labor in the countryside can increase income, so it's best to retire when you meet the retirement requirements. If you still ask for light work when you reach retirement age, it's not good for yourself or the country."
    Speaking of the countryside needing old workers, Wu Linzhao suddenly thought of his fellow villager, Wang Weidong, and said happily, "Old Wang has truly become a treasure in the countryside!"
    This Wang Weidong was also an old worker at the Shanxi Machine Tool Factory. He retired two years ago at the age of sixty and returned to his hometown, Dongjian'an Village, Wutai County. After returning home, the county sent people to visit him twice and found a house in Dongye Town, asking him to move in and telling him: "Now, agricultural machinery and equipment are being used more and more in the countryside, but no one knows how to use them. At the same time, the technical level of the farm tool repair station in Dongye Town is not high. Please be a consultant and give some guidance without having to do any hands-on work." After he went there, Dongye Town actually became the technical guidance center for the countryside. Whenever any agricultural cooperative in the county installed machinery, they asked him to lecture on operating techniques; when the farm tool repair station bought a chassis for a yuan-wheeled cart from Taiyuan, Old Wang drew some diagrams, asked the people at the station to piece together some parts, and turned the chassis into a yuan-wheeled cart, expanding the station's production capacity. This year, during the drought, the locomotive boilers in Dongjian'an Village and Dajian'an Village were burned out. The original plan was to transport them to Taiyuan for repair, but by the time they were repaired and transported back to irrigate the land, the crops would be ruined by the drought. Finally, they invited Master Wang to repair them, and the machines were saved, and the crops were saved.
    Now, everyone in that area knows Master Wang's good skills, and even the exploration team on Mount Wutai sent people to consult him when their drilling rig broke down. Once, a small kiln at the Yaotou Coal Mine on Mount Wutai was flooded. People didn't understand the technology, installed a water pump, but couldn't pump out the water, and couldn't find the problem after tinkering for ten days. After the county learned about it, County Magistrate Ma wrote a letter of introduction, and the mine led a donkey to invite Master Wang up the mountain. After he went there, he directed the workers to repair the water pump in less than three days. Everyone at the mine was all smiles, kept him for seven or eight days to watch operas, and gave him 20 yuan in remuneration. Master Wang said: "The state gives me more than 51 yuan a month in retirement pay, which is enough to spend. How can I accept compensation for this little help?" The mine leaders said, "You helped us repair the water pump and start production early, which is a great contribution. You are old and have skills. Use this money to buy some food and keep yourself healthy, so you can make even greater contributions to society." After repeated explanations, he finally accepted it.
    Now, people in Wutai County often lead donkeys or drive jeeps to invite Wang Weidong. People also congratulate him during the New Year and festivals. His food, clothing, housing, and transportation are all taken care of, and he has also been elected as a people's representative.
    When Wu Linzhao said this, everyone present laughed. (Attached picture)

    退休以后怎么办？
    ——记山西机床厂老工人的谈话
    本报记者  顾页
    12月1日，山西机床厂一些老年工人，在一起座谈国务院关于工人、职员退休处理暂行规定草案。他们一致认为，这个规定充分体现了社会主义社会的优越性。钳工庞玉宝说：我同我的老伴听了这个规定以后，合家欢喜，干起活来劲上加劲。党和政府替我们想得真周到。解放前，工人的晚年不挨饿的有几个？韩治国说：那时候年岁稍大一些，就被工厂一脚踢开了。记得有个姓陶的老师傅，当年在太原，技术数他最出色，可是到老就没人管，只得在大路旁摆个小摊，替人焊焊烟筒，修修锁子，最后竟活活饿死。有一身好手艺还死得这般凄惨，其他老工人是个什么下场，是明明摆着的。如今只要勤恳干活，不用愁老了怎么办了！人说养儿防老，这规定比养个好儿子还靠得住。
    接着，韩治国、毛登科、段黄希等工人提了些具体问题，供政府制定实施细则参考。他们觉得，老工人在新社会受到体贴入微的关怀，好些人到退休年龄还不肯坐着吃闲饭，可否随其自愿，或留厂工作，或到养老院喂鸡养猪。他们提出：有的老工人是单身汉，退休以后怎么办？在原籍没房子的人，退休以后可否仍在工厂宿舍居住？退休返乡的人，领取退休费和供应粮食能否给予方便？还有的人怕退休费不够维持生活（人口多，子女小），留厂继续工作，是否允许？
    具体问题摆出以后，大家又谈到退休以后的出路问题。
    武林召说：我看工人到了退休年龄，只要能够继续工作，本人也不想退休，众人认为他可以留厂，那就让他留厂继续工作好了。庞玉宝说：依我看，够了退休条件，最好还是退休。要知道，岁数不饶人呵！年纪大了，再想干也是心有余而力不足，在机器旁边站上八个小时，你就会觉得耳聋眼花，手不听使唤了。领导上和同志们还得为你捏一把汗，生怕你撑持不住，一下子出了事故。青年人有文化，会计算，体力强，让他们来接替我们，对国家的贡献不是更多些吗？武林召补充道：如果不能坚持原工作，就让他做做打扫厕所那一类轻便工作，一方面给他退休费，另方面他做轻便工作再补贴几个钱，他的生活不更好？庞玉宝解释说：考虑个人，收入可能少些。但是我自己就计算过，每月收入百多元，养活五口，等到我该退休的时候，有的孩儿可以独立生活了，我只需养两三口人，拿上70％的退休费，也是很富裕的呀。李大荣接着说道：够退休条件的老工人，如果工作需要离不开，本人自愿，可以留厂；企业不需要，可以到农村去工作，这样比较好。王银喜说：农村正需要一批老工人去帮助呢，修农具就要人。韩治国插嘴说：是的，有劳动力到农村满可以增加收入，所以最好还是退休条件够了就退休。要是到退休年龄还要求轻便工作，这对自己对国家都不好。
    讲到农村需要老工人，武林召一下子想起自己的同乡王维栋，高兴地说：“老王在农村里真正成了宝贝啦！”
    这王维栋也是山西机床厂的老工人，前年六十岁退休回自己的家乡——五台县东健安村。回到家，县里就两次派人登门访问，还在东冶镇找了间房子，请他搬进去住，并对他说：现在农村里用农业机械设备一天一天多起来，大家都不会用，同时东冶镇上的农具修配站技术水平也不高，请他去当个顾问，指点指点，不用动手干。他去后，东冶镇竟变成了农村的技术指导中心了。县里无论哪个农业社安装机器，都请他去讲操作技术；农具修配站到太原买了一个元车车架，老王绘了些图，叫站上的人七拼八凑地造些零件，就把一个车架变成一台元车，使修配站扩大了生产能力。今年天旱时节，东健安村和大健安村的锅驼机都给烧坏了，原打算运到太原修理，但等修好了再运回去浇地，庄稼也旱坏了。最后就邀请王师傅去修理了一下，机器给救活了，庄稼也给救活了。
    现在，那一带都知道王师傅的好手艺，连五台山上的勘探队坏了钻机，也派人来请教他。一次，五台山上的窑头煤矿，有个小窑被水淹了，人们不懂技术，安了个水泵，但抽不出水，拾掇了十来天也没找着毛病。县里知道后，由马县长写了封介绍信，矿上牵了头毛驴请王师傅上山去。他去一看，不出三天就指挥工人修好了水泵。矿里的人个个眉开眼笑，留他看了七八天戏，又给他二十元酬金。王师傅说：国家一个月给我五十一元多退休费，够花了，这点帮助，哪能要报酬。矿里的领导人说：“你帮助我们修好水泵，提早生产，有大贡献，你年岁大了，有技术，这点钱买点吃的，养好身体，对社会的贡献还大呢。”经一再解释，他才收下了。
    如今五台县里经常有人牵毛驴或者开着吉普车来请王维栋。过年过节人们还纷纷向他道贺。他的衣食住行无不受到关照，并且还被选为人民代表。
    武林召说到这里，在坐的人都笑了。（附图片）
