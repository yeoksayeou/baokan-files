    Simultaneously Engaging in Production and Rectification
　　Over Eight Thousand Agricultural Cooperatives in Shanxi Province Begin Extensive Airing of Views
    Seven Prefectural Committee Members of Xiangtan Prefecture Arrive at the Rectification Front Lines
    (Our Newspaper dispatch) On the basis of carrying out a large-scale debate centered on the grain issue, Shanxi's rural areas have shifted to a nationwide rectification movement. Of the province's more than 20,000 agricultural cooperatives, excluding the 560-plus cooperatives where rectification pilot projects were conducted and concluded by the end of October, a total of 8,200-plus cooperatives have now entered the first batch of rectification. The majority of these are joint-village cooperatives, large-scale cooperatives, and backward cooperatives, with a small number of advanced cooperatives also included. The rectification work of these 8,000-plus agricultural cooperatives is currently in the stage of carrying out extensive airing of views and large-scale debates. Some cooperatives in Yuci and Xin County that started earlier have already entered the rectification and improvement phase. After in-depth ideological mobilization and the removal of various ideological concerns of the masses, the Five-Star Cooperative in Heshun County, in ten days, aired more than 1,700 opinions concerning grain issues, cooperativization issues, the work style of Party and Youth League cadres, operational management, and financial systems. Currently, the Party branch and management committee of the cooperative are organizing the masses to conduct large-scale debates and vigorous rectification in close conjunction with production.
    In order to effectively carry out the movement and further consolidate the socialist position in the countryside to lay a solid foundation for increased production next year, Party committees at all levels have paid great attention to strengthening leadership. In addition to designating a secretary to take charge of the leadership, rural rectification offices have been organized to help Party committees understand and grasp the situation, discover and solve problems, summarize and promote experiences, and guide the movement in a timely manner. At the same time, more than 13,000 county and district cadres (including those who have been transferred to lower levels) have been selected and formed into a unified rectification team, which will go deep into the townships and cooperatives to provide specific assistance.

    (Our Newspaper dispatch) The rural rectification movement in Xiangtan Prefecture, Hunan Province, began in 5,045 agricultural cooperatives in mid-November. At present, most of the cooperatives have entered the stage of comprehensive airing of views and active rectification and improvement.
    The Chinese Communist Party committees at all levels in the Xiangtan area attach great importance to the leadership of the rural rectification movement. The entire area has drawn more than 15,000 cadres from leading organs at the prefectural, county, and township levels to go deep into the agricultural cooperatives to work, with an average of about three cadres per cooperative. The Xiangtan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has also sent seven prefectural committee members to the rectification front lines to direct the work. At the enlarged cadre meetings held in various counties in early November, they conscientiously reviewed the current production situation, summarized the experiences of the pilot rectification cooperatives, and focused on helping cadres correctly understand the close relationship between winter production and rectification.
    When these 5,000-plus agricultural cooperatives began rectification, the first step was to vigorously grasp production and organize a production upsurge. The main methods were: publicizing and studying the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), organizing visits and inspections, and studying typical experiences in increasing production; then, inspecting the local production situation and criticizing right-leaning conservative ideas, thereby formulating winter production plans and next year's production plans. When formulating plans, many cooperatives mobilized the masses to conduct airing of views and debates, and paid attention to solving some specific problems. Judging from the more than 5,000 agricultural cooperatives undergoing rectification in the entire prefecture, 96% of the cooperatives have now experienced a production upsurge.
    In the process of organizing the production upsurge, these cooperatives vigorously publicized the significance and purpose of rectification, understood various ideological situations, and brewed airing of views. After discussion, 744 of the 831 cadres in the four townships of Yueyang Rongjiawan and others expressed their attitude, deciding to humbly listen to the opinions of the masses and do a good job in rectification, and some of them also aired many of their own opinions. Extensive airing of views is also brewing among the broad masses, and many people have eliminated their concerns and made preparations.

    一面生产　一面整社
　　山西省八千多个农业社开始大鸣大放
    湘潭专区七个地委委员到达整风前线
    本报讯　山西农村在开展以粮食问题为中心的大辩论的基础上，已转入全民性的整风运动。全省的两万多个农业社，除在五百六十多个社进行了整风试点，并已于10月底先后结束外，目前进入第一批整风的社共有八千二百多个，其中多数系联村社、大型社和落后社，也有少数先进社。这八千多个农业社的整风工作，目前正在开展大鸣大放大辩论阶段。榆次、忻县等地一部分动手较早的社，已转入整改阶段。和顺县五星社经过深入的思想发动，解除群众的各种思想顾虑后，十天时间即鸣放出有关粮食问题，合作化问题，党、团员干部作风，经营管理，财务制度等方面的意见一千七百多条。目前该社党支部和管理委员会正组织群众紧密结合生产进行大辩论和大力整改。
    为了切实把运动搞好，进一步巩固农村的社会主义阵地，打好明年的增产基础，各地党委都十分注意加强了领导。除确定一个书记专责领导外，并组织了农村整风办公室，以帮助党委了解掌握情况，发现解决问题，总结推广经验，及时指导运动。同时抽调出一万三千多名县、区干部（包括下放的干部在内），统一组成一支整风队伍，分别深入到乡、社进行具体帮助。

    本报讯　湖南省湘潭专区农村的整风运动，11月中旬在五千零四十五个农业社内开展。目前大部分社都进入全面大鸣大放，结合大力进行整改的阶段。
    湘潭地区的中共各级党委很重视对农村整风运动的领导。全区从专区、县、乡各级领导机关中共抽调了一万五千多干部深入到农业社中去工作，平均每个社约有三个干部。中共湘潭地委也派出七个地委委员到整风前线去指挥。全区各县在11月上旬举行的扩大干部会议上，都认真检查了当前生产、总结了整风试点社的经验，着重帮助干部正确认识冬季生产与整风之间的密切联系。
    这五千多个农业社开始整风时，首先是大力抓紧生产，组织生产高潮。主要作法是：宣传、学习全国农业发展纲要（修正草案），组织参观访问，研究增产的典型经验；然后检查当地生产情况，批判右倾保守思想，从而制订今冬生产计划和明年生产规划。在制订计划时，很多社又发动群众进行鸣放争辩，并且注意解决一些具体问题。从全专区的五千多个整风的农业社看来，现在已有96％的社出现了生产高潮。
    在组织生产高潮的过程中，这些社又大力宣传整风的意义和目的，了解各种思想情况，酝酿鸣放。岳阳荣家湾等四个乡八百三十一个社干部，经过讨论后有七百四十四个表明了态度，决定虚心听取群众意见，搞好整风，有的自己也鸣放出不少意见。在广大群众中也正在酝酿大鸣大放，很多人已消除顾虑，作好了准备。
