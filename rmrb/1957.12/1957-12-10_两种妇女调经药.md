Two Kinds of Menstrual Regulating Drugs for Women

There are many drugs for treating menstrual disorders, but the safest, most effective, simplest, and cheapest are the traditional Chinese medicine "Tiao Jing Wan" (Menstrual Regulating Pill) and the Western medicine "Tiao Jing Pian" (Menstrual Regulating Tablet). These two medicines are prepared as over-the-counter drugs according to the prescriptions approved by the Central Ministry of Health. As long as they are used according to the instructions when there is no doctor's guidance, there will be no problems.

The ingredient of "Tiao Jing Pian" is Angelica extract, which is extracted from the traditional Chinese medicine Angelica sinensis. It can be seen that although "Tiao Jing Pian" is a Western medicine, it is actually a processed product of traditional Chinese medicine. Angelica sinensis is called the "essential medicine for women" in China's famous medical book "Compendium of Materia Medica." Li Shizhen also said that it can "harmonize blood and nourish blood," and the famous doctor Zhen Quan of the Tang Dynasty also said that it can treat "women's prolonged bleeding, lower back pain, metrorrhagia, and replenish all deficiencies." These ancient experiences have been scientifically proven today. It turns out that Angelica sinensis contains vitamins B1 and B2, which are effective drugs for pernicious anemia, and therefore can indirectly replenish blood. Angelica sinensis can also stimulate the uterine muscles and relax them, which makes it easier to discharge the blood stasis accumulated in the uterus. The relaxation of the uterine muscles also allows local blood circulation to flow smoothly, and the nutrition of the uterine body is improved.

"Tiao Jing Pian" should be taken three times a day, one or two tablets each time after meals. It should be taken for a longer period of time, which will also help the development of the uterus, and the curative effect will be more definite. But do not take too much at one time, as this may cause nosebleeds and dryness of the mouth and throat. Pregnant women should not take it, otherwise it will cause the fetus to develop too large and make delivery difficult.

"Tiao Jing Wan" is a traditional Chinese medicine over-the-counter drug, and its effect is similar to "Tiao Jing Pian." It is formulated with more medicinal materials. In addition to Angelica sinensis, it also contains Cyperus rotundus, Leonurus japonicus, Atractylodes macrocephala, Paeonia lactiflora, and twenty-one other medicinal materials. This medicine is compounded, so its effect is more comprehensive and powerful.

The packaging of "Tiao Jing Wan" is not consistent, but it is sold in pharmacies everywhere. It is a small honey pill, easy to swallow. Take two qian each time with boiled water. If it can be used for a longer period of time, the effect will be more complete.

    两种妇女调经药
    治疗月经病的药物很多，讲到安全、有效、简便、价廉的则要推中药“调经丸”与西药“调经片”。这二种药都是遵照中央卫生部核定的处方配就的成药，在没有大夫指导的时候，只要按照仿单应用，是不会出乱子的。
    “调经片”的成分是当归浸膏，是从中药当归中提炼出来的。由此可见，“调经片”虽说是一种西药，实际上也是一种中药的加工制成品。当归，我国有名的药书“本草纲目”中称它为“女人要药”，李时珍还说它可“和血补血”，唐代名医甄权也说它可以治疗“女人沥血腰痛，崩中，补诸不足”。这些古人的经验今天又在科学中得到证明，原来当归中含有维生素B1和B2，它是恶性贫血的特效药，因此能起间接的补血作用。当归也能刺激子宫肌肉，使其放松，这样又使积贮在子宫内的瘀血易于排出；由于子宫肌肉的放松也使局部的血液循环获得畅流，子宫体的营养就得到改善。
    “调经片”每天服三次，饭后每次一、二片。应作较长期的服用，这样它还有帮助子宫发育的作用，所起的疗效也更确切。但不能一次服用很多，这样会使鼻腔出血和口腔、咽喉干燥。孕妇不能服用，否则会使胎儿发育过大，分娩困难。
    “调经丸”是中药成药，作用与“调经片”相似。它所配合的药料较多，除当归外，还配有香附、益母草、白术、白芍等二十一种药料。这药既是复合配制的，因而起的作用比较全面有力。
    “调经丸”的包装并不一致，但各地药铺均有出售。它是一种小蜜丸，吞服容易，每次服用二钱，用白开水送服。如能较长期的应用，收效就更为完满。
