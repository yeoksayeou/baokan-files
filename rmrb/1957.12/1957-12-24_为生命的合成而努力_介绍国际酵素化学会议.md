    Striving for the Synthesis of Life
    —An Introduction to the International Enzyme Chemistry Conference
    The International Enzyme Chemistry Conference was held in Tokyo and Kyoto, Japan, from October 15th to 23rd. Representatives from relevant disciplines in the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and other countries, as well as Japanese scholars, attended the conference. The academic reports presented by the Soviet delegation, led by Academician Oparin, at the conference not only attracted the attention of scholars in the global biochemistry community but also drew the attention of people worldwide. The outstanding achievements of Soviet scientists in biochemistry once again demonstrated to the world the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system.
    This conference was divided into four parallel sessions. Each session focused on a single theme for reports and discussions. The synthesis of proteins and ribonucleic acid was of the greatest interest to the scientists. These two types of substances are indispensable components of any biological cell and are the foundation of life. In recent years, there has been significant progress in the study of the synthesis of these two substances. Therefore, it is understandable that this conference focused on discussing this issue.
    Academician Oparin of the Soviet Union presented research findings on the problem of protein synthesis at the session on "The Formation Mechanism of Proteins and Enzymes." Academician Oparin wrote the book "The Origin of Life" as early as 1936. In this book, he proposed a completely new, dialectical materialistic argument on the evolution of the organic world. His insightful argumentation has been highly praised by scientists in the field of biochemistry worldwide. This time, Academician Oparin introduced various reactions he observed after adding enzymes to "coacervates." "Coacervates" are a type of colloid, and Oparin believes that life originated from these "coacervates." He added multiple enzymes to the "coacervates," imitating living organisms, so that these artificially made "coacervates" could synthesize proteins after absorbing substances from the outside world. If this experiment is successful, it will be equivalent to taking the first step toward the synthesis of life.
    At this session, Dr. Masayasu Nomura of the University of Tokyo, Japan, and Dr. Pollock of the United Kingdom, among others, debated the mechanism of protein synthesis. Nomura believes that amino acids need to form an intermediate product before they can form amylase (a protein that can decompose starch); while Pollock believes that in living cells, amino acids do not need to form an intermediate product first and can be directly synthesized into enzymes (proteins) within two minutes. Dr. Straub of Hungary agreed with Nomura's opinion. Academician Engelhardt of the Soviet Union also reported on his research work. He believes that the protein involved in muscle contraction is a type of enzyme. This enzyme can decompose a substance in muscles and release energy; and there is also an enzyme attached to the outside of the cell membrane that can only decompose this substance outside the cell but not inside the cell.
    At another session, Dr. Makoto Ishimoto of Japan proposed that a bacterium also needs the same substance—cytochrome—that general organisms need during aerobic respiration when performing nitrate respiration (i.e., using nitrate salts instead of oxygen to carry out respiration). This experimental result confirms Oparin's view that in the primitive era when there was no oxygen on Earth, organisms could not perform aerobic respiration and could only rely on the reduction of sulfuric acid or nitric acid to obtain the energy they needed. At this session, reports on amino acid oxidase were also presented.
    At the third session, several reports on oxidation and energy metabolism in organisms were presented. At the same time, Professor Kornberg and Professor Ochoa of the United States also gave reports on the synthesis of nucleic acids.
    The theme of the fourth session was on the application of enzymes. Professor Custer of the United Kingdom proposed that glucosamine can be used to treat cancer. Glucosamine cannot be synthesized into nucleic acids, so cancer cells cannot proliferate when they absorb this substance, thus preventing the development of cancer. Dr. Shukuro Kinoshita, the creator of "Ajinomoto," reported that he used the action of enzymes to synthesize glutamic acid from glucose, starch, and nitrides. And Ajinomoto is the sodium salt of glutamic acid. This means that Ajinomoto or MSG, which previously needed to be extracted from plant products, can now be synthesized artificially.

    为生命的合成而努力
    ——介绍国际酵素化学会议
    国际酵素化学会议于10月15日到23日在日本东京和京都举行。参加这次会议的有苏联、美国、英国、法国、德国、荷兰、比利时等国有关学科的代表和日本的有关学者。以奥巴林院士为首的苏联代表团在会议上所作的学术报告，不仅引起了全世界生物化学界学者们的重视，而且引起了全世界人们的注意。苏联科学家在生物化学方面的卓越成就，又一次向全世界显示出社会主义制度的无比优越性。
    这次会议分成四个分会同时举行。各分会各就一个主题进行报告和讨论。科学家们最感兴趣的是蛋白质和核糖核酸的合成问题。这两类物质是任何生物的细胞中不可缺少的成分，是生命的基础。近年来对这两种物质合成问题的研究，有了长足的进展。因此这次会议的集中讨论这个问题，是可以理解的。
    苏联奥巴林院士在“蛋白质和酵素的形成机制”问题的分会上报告了关于蛋白质合成问题的研究成果。奥巴林院士早在1936年就写了“生命的起源”一书。他在这本书中，对有机界的进化提出了崭新的、辩证唯物主义的论点。他的精辟的论证，全世界生物化学方面的科学家都曾经予以很高的评价。这次奥巴林院士介绍了他向“团聚体”中加入酵素后所看到的各种反应。“团聚体”是一种胶体，奥巴林认为生命就起源于这种“团聚体”。他将向“团聚体”中加入多种酵素，模仿生物，使这种人工做成的“团聚体”从外界摄取物质以后能合成蛋白质。如果这个实验获得成功，那就等于向生命的合成迈开了第一步。
    在这一分会上，日本东京大学野村真康博士和英国波罗克博士等就蛋白质合成机制的问题展开了争论。野村认为，氨基酸需要先形成一种中间产物，然后才能形成淀粉酵素（一种能使淀粉分解的蛋白质）；而波罗克认为，在活细胞内，氨基酸不必先形成中间产物，在两分钟内就可以直接合成为酵素（蛋白质）。匈牙利斯徒劳布博士同意野村的意见。苏联恩格哈特院士也报告了他的研究工作。他认为参与肌肉收缩的蛋白质就是一种酵素。这种酵素能使肌肉内的一种物质分解而放出能量；并且还有一种酵素，附着在细胞膜的外面，只能使细胞外的这种物质分解而不能使细胞内的这种物质分解。
    在另一分会上，日本石本真博士提出，一种细菌在进行硝酸呼吸（即不用氧气而用硝盐使行呼吸作用）时，也需要一般生物在行有氧呼吸时所需要的同一种物质——细胞色素。这一实验结果证实了奥巴林的看法，即认为在地球上还没有氧的原始时代，生物不能行有氧呼吸，只能靠硫酸或硝酸的还原取得所需要的能量。在这一分会上，还提出了关于氨基酸的氧化酵素的报告。
    在第三分会上提出了几篇关于生物体内的氧化作用和能量代谢的报告。同时，美国肯巴格教授和奥其约瓦教授也作了有关核酸的合成的报告。
    第四分会的主题是关于酵素的应用。英国卡斯特教授提出，用氨基葡萄糖能治疗癌。氨基葡萄糖不能合成为核酸，所以癌细胞吸收这种物质就不能增殖，这样就可以阻止癌的发展。“味之素”的创造人木下祝郎博士报告，他利用酵素的作用从葡萄糖、淀粉和氮化物合成了谷氨酸。而味之素就是谷氨酸的钠盐。这就是说，以前需要从植物产品中提取的味之素或味精，现在可以人工合成了。
