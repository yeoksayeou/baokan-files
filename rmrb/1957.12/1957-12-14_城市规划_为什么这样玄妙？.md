　　Why is "Urban Planning" So Mysterious?
　　The Tianjin Local State-Operated Rubber Factory planned to build more than a hundred simple houses nearby to solve the housing problem for its employees. However, the Tianjin Municipal Construction Bureau emphasized that the simple houses occupied too much land and did not meet the requirements of urban planning, insisting that they build standard dormitories in the Zhongshanmen Workers' New Village. But the money for building more than a hundred simple houses could only build forty standard dormitories, which would not solve the problem.
　　If the Tianjin Municipal Construction Bureau is worried about occupying too much land, it doesn't seem to be the case. The Tianjin Hedong District Second Transportation Equipment Production Cooperative, due to the expansion of production and the number of employees, found that the original factory buildings and dormitories were not sufficient. If they could just be allocated three to five mu of land nearby for expansion, the problem would be solved. However, the Tianjin Municipal Construction Bureau approved thirty mu of land for them in Baimiao, a remote northern suburb, insisting that they build there. The reason was to comply with urban planning. Following the Construction Bureau's advice would not only require a large investment, but also bring a lot of trouble to production and employees' lives.
　　Why is this "urban planning" so mysterious? Can it be changed according to the current actual situation, and in the spirit of saving construction funds and facilitating production and employees' lives?

### “城市规划”为什么这样玄妙？

　　“城市规划”为什么这样玄妙？
    天津地方国营橡胶一厂准备在近处盖一百多间简易房屋，以解决职工的住房问题。但是，天津市建设局强调简易房屋占地过多，不符合城市规划的要求，非叫他们到中山门工人新村去盖标准宿舍不可。而盖一百多间简易房屋的钱，盖标准宿舍只能盖四十间，解决不了问题。
    如果说天津市建设局是怕多占地吧，却也不见得。天津市河东区第二交通器材生产合作社，因为生产和职工人数扩大了，原来的厂房和宿舍都不够用，只要就近拨给他们三到五亩地扩建一下，问题也就解决了。可是，天津市建设局却在很远的北郊区的白庙这个地方批给他们三十亩地，非叫他们到那儿去建设不可。理由也是要服从城市规划。要按建设局的意见办事，不但投资很大，而且给生产和职工生活都带来很多麻烦。
    这个“城市规划”为什么这样玄妙呢？能不能根据当前的实际情况，根据节约建设资金、便利生产和职工生活的精神改变一下呢？
