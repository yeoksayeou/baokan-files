    Beware of Asthma Recurrence
    Asthma is a disease that is not easily cured, and when it flares up, the patient struggles to breathe, which is very painful. In winter, if you don't pay close attention, this disease is more likely to recur.
    The onset of this disease is often caused by "allergies." For example, some patients are sensitive to certain foods (like eggs, shrimp, fish...), and contact with them will cause a "relapse." By the way, why do some people develop asthma in the same environment, after contact with the same things, while others are fine? This is related to each person's nervous system (referring to the cerebral cortex). If a person's nervous excitability is relatively high, they are prone to this disease. Since this disease is closely related to the nervous system, if patients can maintain a happy mental state and try to avoid emotional fluctuations, it will also reduce the recurrence of the disease.
    Cold is a stimulus to the respiratory tract. It will cause the blood vessels to constrict first and then dilate, thus reducing the resistance of the respiratory tract. Bacteria take advantage of this opportunity, creating favorable conditions for the recurrence of asthma. So, in winter, dress warmly. Is it necessary to stay indoors all day, guarding the stove to avoid the cold? Not necessarily. When going out, just wear a mask, both to block the cold (healthy people don't need to use a mask to block the cold) and to prevent polluted air. Indoors, also open doors and windows from time to time to keep the air fresh. At noon, when the temperature is higher, you can take a walk outdoors and bask in the sun.
    Smoking is a major enemy of asthma patients and should be avoided, because smoke increases the secretion of bronchial mucosa (that is, phlegm), causing coughing, which will tempt asthma to recur.
    Appropriate attention to nutrition, especially the intake of vitamins (for example, an appropriate amount of vitamin A can enhance the resistance of the bronchial mucosa), is also very important.
    In short, whether or not this old disease of asthma recurs largely depends on the patient themselves. If they can pay good attention, they can reduce the occurrence of attacks.

    当心喘病复发
    气喘病很不容易断根，一发起来，病人上气不接下气，十分痛苦。冬天，如果不很好注意，这病更易发作。
    这病的发作往往是“过敏”引起的，例如有些病人对某种食物（像鸡蛋、虾子、鱼……）敏感，一接触就会“老病复发”。顺便说一下，为什么同样的环境，接触同样的东西，有些人发喘病，有些人却没事，这和每个人的神经系统（指大脑皮质）有关系。如果一个人的神经兴奋性比较高，就容易发这种病。既然这种病和神经系统有密切的关系，那么，病人要是能够经常精神愉快，尽力避免情绪的波动，也就会减少这病的复发。
    寒冷对呼吸道是一种刺激，它会使血管先收缩，后扩张，因而降低呼吸道的抵抗能力，细菌便乘火打劫，为气喘的复发造成有利条件。所以在冬天要穿得暖和些。是不是一天到晚在屋里，守着火炉子来避寒呢？这倒不必。外出时只要戴个口罩，一方面挡寒（健康人则不必用口罩挡寒），一方面预防污浊的空气。在屋里也要不时开放门窗，使空气新鲜。中午气温较高，可以到室外散散步，晒晒太阳。
    吸烟是气喘病人的大敌，应该戒忌，因为烟使支气管粘膜的分泌（就是痰）增多，引起咳嗽，会勾引喘病复发。
    适当注意营养，特别是维生素的摄取（例如适量的维生素甲，能增强支气管粘膜的抵抗力），也是很重要的。
    总之，气喘这个老病的复发与否，很大因素决定于患者自己，如果能好好地注意，可以减少发作。
