Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, December 8th: Foundry worker Zhang Jinrong fulfilled his pledge to complete ten years of work in five years, twenty-four days ahead of schedule, as of December 7th.

Zhang Jinrong is a foundry worker at the Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory. He made this pledge last year on December 27th, when he completed eight years' worth of work.

At noon on the 7th, the factory was filled with the sound of gongs and drums. A congratulatory team of over a hundred people, consisting of Party, government, labor union, and Youth League representatives, as well as advanced producers from within the factory, arrived at the foundry workshop with silk banners to congratulate Zhang Jinrong. They called him "a person running ahead of the new high tide of production."

Zhang Jinrong is not only an outstanding foundry fast-hand but also an excellent producer who achieves more, faster, better, and more economically. Of the tens of thousands of products he has produced in five years, only seven were rejects. Zhang Jinrong pays great attention to thrift and never discards a bent or rusty nail. Where others use one bucket of sand to make one brake cylinder body, he can make two with the same amount. Zhang Jinrong is thirty years old this year, but his foundry work experience is only thirteen years less than his age. Because of his diligent study and hard work, he is now a seventh-grade foundry worker.

He works in the Iron Department's mold baking parts group, and the workpieces he handles change frequently. Large workpieces weigh more than a ton, while small ones weigh less than a kilogram, and they are often urgent, requiring immediate attention. Foremen often turn to Zhang Jinrong when they encounter difficult or urgent work assignments. Therefore, he has become the workshop's shock worker for completing rush tasks.

Zhang Jinrong is never satisfied with his achievements. He summarizes his experience after each workpiece, leading to new improvements each time. When he receives a workpiece he has never made before, he consults other experienced masters, greatly reducing the time spent on experimentation. Over the past five years, his work quota has been revised nine times. Many product quotas have exceeded the initial quotas set during the early stages of the Five-Year Plan several times over. Each time the quota is revised, he breaks through the target within about a month.

Zhang Jinrong attaches great importance to pre-production preparation. After the daily work assignment meeting, he prepares the tools needed for the next day, so that he can start work immediately upon arriving at work. He is also very clear about the operation process of each day's workpieces, allowing him to produce in an unhurried and relaxed manner, efficiently and easily.

Zhang Jinrong realized that allowing the left hand to remain idle during production was a great waste, so he constantly trained his left hand. Through arduous training, he finally created a two-handed operation method, which more than doubled his work efficiency.

He also created the "three-near" work method: sand bucket near, tools near, and the worker's position near the workpiece, which shortens auxiliary time and reduces labor intensity. It generally takes workers eleven minutes to mold a chill ring; Zhang Jinrong, using the "three-near" method, only needs one minute and fifty seconds.

When Zhang Jinrong gave his reply to the congratulatory team, he said: "I thank the Party and everyone for the honor given to me. But I am not pursuing honor for its own sake; I am doing it to realize socialism as soon as possible, so that our children and grandchildren can live happy lives." (Attached picture)

### 五年完成十年工作量　向优秀的翻砂工人张金荣贺喜

　　五年完成十年工作量
　　向优秀的翻砂工人张金荣贺喜
    据新华社南京8日电　翻砂工张金荣到本月7日提前二十四天实现了五年完成十年工作量的保证。
    张金荣是戚墅堰机车车辆修理工厂的翻砂工人。他是在去年12月27日完成八年工作量的时候提出这个保证的。
    7日中午，工厂里锣鼓喧天，一支由党、政、工、团和厂内先进生产者等一百多人组成的贺喜队带着锦旗来到翻砂车间，向张金荣贺喜。他们称他为“跑在生产新高潮前面的人”。
    张金荣不仅是出色的翻砂快手，而且还是一个作到多、快、好、省的优秀生产者。他五年生产的上万件产品，只有七件废品；张金荣很注意节约，决不丢弃一个弯钉和锈钉，别人一桶砂做一个制动缸体，他用一桶砂可以做两个。张金荣今年三十岁，但是他的翻砂工龄只比他的年龄少十三岁。由于他勤学苦练，现在已经是一个七级翻砂工人。
    他在铁部烘模零件组工作，平日的工作物经常调换；大的工作物有一吨多重，小的工作物不到一公斤，而且又是急件，必须随到随做。工长遇到难派的和紧急的工作，大都找张金荣。因此，他成了车间完成突击任务的突击手。
    张金荣从不满足已得的成绩，每做一件工作物都要总结一次，因此每做一次都有新的改进。他接到自己没有做过的工作物，就去请教别的老师傅，减少很多摸索的时间。五年以来，他的工时定额修改了九次。许多产品定额，都超过五年计划初期定额的好几倍。每次修改定额以后，他只要一月左右，就会突破定额指标。
    张金荣非常重视生产前的准备工作，在每天派活会以后就把第二天所需要的工具准备好，以便一上班就立即工作。他对每天工作物的操作过程，也很明确，生产时不紧不忙，又顺手、又轻松。
    张金荣想到在生产中让左手闲着，是很大的浪费，因此便经常锻炼自己的左手。由于艰苦锻炼，他终于创造了双手操作法，工作效率提高一倍以上。
    他还创造了砂桶近、工具近、人和工作物的位置近的“三近”工作法，缩短了辅助时间，减轻了劳动强度；冷圈造型一般工人十一分钟做一只，张金荣使用“三近”法，只要一分五十秒造一只。
    张金荣向贺喜队致答词的时候说：“我感谢党和大家给我的荣誉。但是我并不是为了追求荣誉，我是为了早日实现社会主义，让子子孙孙过幸福的日子”。（附图片）
