Double Red Soup

Winter is the season for eating haws and red dates. Like haws, red dates are fruits containing rich nutrients (the nutritional value of haws has been introduced above). However, the vitamin C content of dates is higher than that of apples and pears; the calorific value is also higher than that of general fruits, at 309 kilocalories per 100 grams. If dates and haws are cooked together, the color is bright, the nutrition is rich, and the price is cheap. Now, I will introduce the method of making Double Red Soup as follows:

Ingredients: Half a catty of haws, half a catty of red dates, two taels of white sugar. The total cost is about forty cents.

Preparation: Wash the haws, cut them open, and remove the stems and pits. Wash the red dates, put them in a pot with two large bowls of water, and put them on the fire to cook first. When the date skins bulge, add the haws and cook together. When the haws are slightly soft, add the white sugar, stir, and cook for a while, until the soup thickens.

    双红羹
    冬天是吃红果和红枣的季节。红枣和红果一样，都是含有丰富营养素的果品（红果的营养价值，上文已作介绍）。但是枣的维生素丙的含量比苹果、梨都高；发热量也比一般水果高，每百克为309仟卡。如果用枣和红果煮来吃，颜色鲜艳，营养丰富，而且价钱便宜。现在，介绍双红羹的做法如下：
    材料：红果半斤、红枣半斤、白糖二两。约共四角钱。
    制法：将红果洗净，切开，去柄及核。将红枣洗净，放在锅内加水二大碗，放在火上先煮。待枣皮凸起时，再把红果放入同煮。到红果微烂时，加入白糖，搅拌后，再煮一会，待汤浓时即成。
