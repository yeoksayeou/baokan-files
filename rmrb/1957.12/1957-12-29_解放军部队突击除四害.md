Xinhua News Agency, December 27th: Many units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have launched a campaign to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene. Some units have also combined this campaign with the current socialist education movement in the company, or listed it as one of the rectification measures in the organs' rectification campaign.

    The Chengdu Garrison units launched a "Four Pests Elimination Surprise Month" in mid-November, with everyone from generals to soldiers actively participating. The automotive unit established a Four Pests Elimination Headquarters on the day of mobilization, organizing nine youth shock teams and ninety-five shock groups. According to statistics from the first half of the surprise month, officers, soldiers, and staff of the Chengdu Garrison units have already eliminated 21,026 rats and sparrows, over 310,000 mosquitoes and flies, blocked nearly 5,000 rat holes, destroyed over 3,000 sparrow nests, cleared over 1,600 meters of sewage ditches, and disposed of over 3,000 dan (approx. 300,000 lbs) of sludge and garbage.

    The Political Department of the Beijing Garrison units held a meeting of all cadres on December 13th, conveying the Beijing Municipal Plan for carrying out the winter campaign to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene, and announcing the department's specific implementation plan. After the meeting, the Political Department established a Patriotic Health Campaign Committee, and each dormitory organized hygiene groups and sparrow-catching teams. An internal exhibition of pictures on eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene was held in the organs, and scientific educational films on eliminating the four pests were screened. After further understanding the great significance of eliminating the four pests, the officers and soldiers are vigorously carrying out various specific activities.

    Many units of the People's Liberation Army have been continuously engaged in the elimination of the four pests in recent years and have achieved great results. The Sixth Company of a certain unit of the Chengdu Garrison eliminated a total of 2,576 rats and sparrows in half a year, and the young soldier Wang Ancai alone eliminated 500. Over the past two years, the various units on the Fujian Front have eliminated a total of 552,850 rats, 373,020 sparrows, and a large number of flies and mosquitoes. Due to the long-term persistence in the movement to eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene, many companies have basically eliminated the occurrence of diseases such as malaria and dysentery. In order to further cooperate with the local masses to continue carrying out this movement, the leading organs of the Fujian Front troops recently issued a notice to the subordinate organs and troops, requesting that all units immediately take the initiative to contact the relevant departments of the local government, make comprehensive arrangements, cooperate with each other, and further set off a large-scale movement to eliminate the four pests and promote patriotic hygiene.

    解放军部队突击除四害
    新华社27日讯　中国人民解放军许多部队展开了除四害、讲卫生运动。有些部队还把这一运动同当前连队社会主义教育运动结合起来，或者列为机关整风中的整改内容之一。
    成都驻军各单位在11月中旬开始发起除四害突击月，从将军到士兵，都积极参加。汽车某部在动员的当天就成立了除四害指挥部，组织了九个青年突击队和九十五个突击小组。据突击月上半月的统计，成都驻军各单位的官兵和职工们已经消灭鼠、雀两万一千零二十六只、蚊蝇三十一万多只，堵塞鼠洞近五千个，捣毁雀窠三千多个，清理污水沟一千六百多公尺，处理污泥、垃圾三千多担。
    北京地区部队政治部在12月13日专门召开了全体干部会议，传达了北京市开展冬季除四害、讲卫生运动的计划，宣布了本部门的具体实施计划。会后，政治部成立了爱国卫生运动委员会，各宿舍分别组织了卫生小组和捕雀队，并举办了机关内部除四害、讲卫生的图片展览，放映了除四害的科学教育影片。官兵们在进一步认识了除四害的重大意义以后，正在大力展开各项具体活动。
    人民解放军许多部队在近几年来一直没有间断除四害的活动，并且取得了很大成绩。成都驻军某部六连在半年中共消灭老鼠、麻雀两千五百七十六只，青年战士王安才一人就消灭了五百只。福建前线各部队近两年来共消灭老鼠五十五万二千八百五十只，麻雀三十七万三千零二十只，以及大量的苍蝇和蚊子。由于长期坚持了除四害、讲卫生运动，很多连队已经基本上消灭了疟疾和痢疾等疾病的发生。为了进一步配合当地群众继续开展这一运动，福建前线部队领导机关最近又向所属机关、部队发出通知，要求各部队立即与当地政府有关部门主动取得联系，全面安排，互相配合，进一步掀起声势浩大的除四害和爱国卫生运动。
