　　Moving Forward on the Road of Integration with Workers and Peasants
　　——Commemorating the 22nd Anniversary of the "December 9th" Movement
    Today is the 22nd anniversary of the "December 9th" Movement. As the revolution on our country's political and ideological fronts has achieved great victories, it is of even greater and more significant importance for the broad masses of young people to commemorate this great festival.

      In the "December 9th" era, revolutionary young intellectuals, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, inherited the patriotic tradition of Chinese youth, carried forward the spirit of hard work and plain living, resolutely embarked on the road of integration with workers and peasants, went to the countryside, went to the factories, went to the liberated areas, participated in the people's liberation war, and wrote a glorious page in the history of our country's revolution. Their revolutionary actions set a brilliant example for the youth of our country.

    Over the past twenty-two years, our country has undergone earth-shaking changes. The Chinese Communist Party has led the people of the whole country to overthrow the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, establish the People's China, and further basically complete the socialist revolution of the ownership of the means of production. At present, our country's industrial and agricultural production has made tremendous progress. Our country's first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy has been completed and overfulfilled, thus laying a preliminary foundation for our country's industrialization. The basic task facing the working class and the people is to build our country into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science. Our Party has issued a loud call to catch up with and surpass Great Britain, the second most powerful capitalist country in the world, in steel and other important industrial products in fifteen years. The balance of power between the two major camps in the world has reached a new turning point, the forces of the new world have overcome the old world, and the east wind prevails over the west wind. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is working together to build the most beautiful socialist mansion for mankind. These new domestic and international situations have given a strong encouragement to the vast number of young people in our country. With the deepening of socialist construction and socialist revolution, the Party and the people have put forward higher demands on young students and young intellectuals, requiring them to thoroughly transform their thinking and become working-class intellectuals with a firm working-class stand, loving socialism, closely integrating with the workers and peasants, and serving the people wholeheartedly, that is, to be cultured laborers. Serving the workers and peasants, integrating with the workers and peasants, carrying forward the tradition of hard work and plain living, and being cultured laborers, are precisely the revolutionary road taken by intellectuals in the "December 9th" Movement.

    Encouraged by the victorious situation, the broad masses of young students and young intellectuals have shown ambition, braced their spirits, and wanted to make their own contributions to socialist construction and the new world, thus further strengthening their determination and confidence in transforming themselves, overcoming individualism, and subordinating themselves to collective interests. Loving labor, accepting labor training, and integrating with the workers and peasants have begun to take shape. From elementary schools to middle schools, from middle schools to universities, we can see vast numbers of students participating in physical labor and making friends with the workers and peasants. The scale and the number of people are truly unprecedented. Teachers and students of Northwestern Polytechnical University went to the rural areas in the suburbs of Xianyang to participate in physical labor. Many farmers praised them, saying, "These people do whatever work is available and don't put on any airs!" Although this is a plain and simple sentence, it reveals a truth and shows a gratifying phenomenon. When intellectuals put down their airs and integrate with the workers and peasants, they will be welcomed by the workers and peasants. If all the intellectuals in the country had no airs and went to the workers and peasants to serve them, then, it is conceivable that the alliance of workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals would inevitably be more consolidated, thereby greatly promoting our country's socialist construction. We congratulate these young intellectuals who are integrating with the workers and peasants, consolidate and persist in their labor enthusiasm.

    However, we should also see that some young intellectuals have not yet recognized the important significance of participating in labor training and integrating with the workers and peasants. They think they have knowledge and cannot put down their airs. They look down on workers and peasants, and although they verbally acknowledge that workers and peasants are the creators of material and spiritual wealth, they think that participating in physical labor is a waste of time and that dealing with workers and peasants is uninteresting. They do not know that labor created mankind, but mankind must continue to transform itself in future labor. Physical labor is the foundation of all labor, the source of creating material and spiritual wealth, and one of the important characteristics of communism is to combine mental and physical labor. Physical labor is glorious and noble. Only exploiters regard physical labor as low and terrible, and try their best to avoid it. Young intellectuals in all walks of life in our country should actively and consciously participate in physical labor, train and transform themselves into working-class intellectuals who are integrated with workers and peasants, who have both knowledge and are good at labor. If they are not trained in labor, if they cannot become one with the working masses, then, studying Marxism-Leninism may lead to dogmatism; studying mathematics and physics may be "only specialized but not red"; studying literature and art may lead to "one-bookism"; and studying technology may lead to the idea that technology is above all else. When young intellectuals go to labor and integrate with the workers and peasants, they can prevent and overcome erroneous views such as dogmatism, one-bookism, and technology above all else, and will prepare conditions for thorough ideological transformation.

    Is it a waste of time for young intellectuals to go to the workers and peasants and participate in production labor with them? Or does it promote growth? Is it interesting? Or is it uninteresting? It seems that the answer is that it promotes growth and is very interesting. As early as 1939, when commemorating the May Fourth Youth Day, Comrade Mao Zedong said, "The final demarcation between revolutionary, non-revolutionary, or counter-revolutionary intellectuals depends on whether they are willing and practice integration with the workers and peasants." It will be more cordial and flavorful for the vast number of young intellectuals to review Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions today. Many young intellectuals who have gone to the mountains and the countryside have also told us this from their personal experiences. A student from Shandong Institute of Technology helped an agricultural cooperative pull cabbage. He said, "We are only now beginning to understand the meaning of 'willingly be an ox for the children,' and in the future, we will always be good sons and daughters of the working people in all our work." This is a very good idea. Going to labor and integrating with the workers and peasants is precisely the "necessary path" and "required course" for the fundamental transformation of the ideology and style of intellectuals. At present, young people in organs who meet the conditions for physical labor, middle and primary school graduates who cannot continue their studies, and other young intellectuals should actively respond to the Party's call, go to the countryside and the mountains, and go to the workers and peasants to transform themselves.

    In order to ideologically eliminate the obstacles to integrating with the workers and peasants and actively participate in physical labor, the vast number of young people must also carry forward the fine style of hard work, plain living, and endurance of the "December 9th" Movement. The vast number of young people must learn from the revolutionary optimism of the revolutionary predecessors who were not afraid of difficulties and hardships, implement the spirit of building the country diligently and thriftily, running schools diligently and thriftily, and managing households diligently and thriftily, consciously train themselves in life and struggle, and cultivate themselves into cultured laborers. Hard work and diligence are the source of our great strength to overcome difficulties and accelerate national construction. We must save every penny of funds and invest it in construction, accelerate national accumulation, so as to build our country into the richest and most powerful country in the world in the next few decades. This is the responsibility of the people of the whole country, including every young person. We believe that this generation of young people, who have been nurtured by the Party for a long time, will certainly be able to inherit and carry forward the revolutionary tradition of "December 9th," and will certainly be willing and able to make up their minds to transform themselves, become conscious fighters for building socialism, shoulder the mission of the times, and forge ahead on the bright road of communism!

    在同工农结合的道路上前进
　　——纪念“一二·九”运动二十二周年
    今天是“一二·九”运动二十二周年。在我国政治战线和思想战线上的革命取得了巨大胜利的形势下，广大青年来纪念这个伟大的节日，更有新的重大的意义。
      “一二·九”时代的革命的知识青年，为了争取民族解放，在中国共产党领导下，继承了中国青年爱国主义的传统，发扬了艰苦朴素的精神，毅然走上同工农结合的道路，到农村去，到工厂去，到解放区去，参加人民解放战争，在我国革命史上写下了光辉的一页。他们的这种革命行动，为我国青年树立了光辉的榜样。
    二十二年来，我们的国家已经经历了翻天复地的变化。中国共产党领导全国人民推翻了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的统治，建立了人民的中国，并且进一步基本完成了生产资料所有制的社会主义革命。目前，我国工农业生产已经有了巨大的发展。我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划已经完成和超额完成，从而为我国的工业化事业奠定了初步基础。我国工人阶级和我国人民面临的基本任务，就是要把我国建成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义强国。我们党已经发出响亮的号召，要在十五年后，使我国的钢铁和其他重要工业产品赶上和超过世界上第二个最强大的资本主义国家英国。现在世界两大阵营力量的对比已经达到了新的转折点，新世界的力量胜过了旧世界，东风压倒了西风。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，正在同心协力建设人类最美满的社会主义大厦。这些国内国际的新形势，给我国广大青年以有力的鼓舞。随着社会主义建设和社会主义革命的深入发展，党和人民对青年学生和青年知识分子提出了更高的要求，要求他们彻底改造思想，成为具有坚定的工人阶级立场，热爱社会主义，同工农群众密切结合，全心全意为人民服务的工人阶级知识分子，也就是说，做有文化的劳动者。而为工农服务，同工农结合，发扬艰苦朴素的传统，做有文化的劳动者，正是在“一二·九”运动中知识分子所走的革命道路。
    在胜利形势的鼓舞下，广大青年学生和青年知识分子，都表现出有志气，振作精神，要为社会主义建设和新世界作出自己的贡献，从而更增强了他们改造自己的决心和信心，克服个人主义，服从集体利益。热爱劳动，接受劳动锻炼，同工农群众相结合，已经开始形成风气。从小学到中学，从中学到高等学校，我们都可以看到广大学生参加体力劳动，同工农群众交上了朋友。规模之大，人数之多，真是前所未有。西北工业大学师生到咸阳市郊农村参加体力劳动。许多农民称赞说，“这些人见活计就做，没有一点架子！”这虽然是一句平凡而简单的话，可是它道破了一条真理，表明了一种可喜的现象。知识分子放下架子，同工农群众相结合，就会为工农群众所欢迎。假如全国知识分子都没有一点架子，到工农群众中去，为工农群众服务，那么，可以想像，工人、农民、革命知识分子的联盟必然更加巩固，从而大大地促进我国的社会主义建设事业。我们祝贺这些同工农结合的知识青年，把劳动热情巩固下来，坚持下去。
    但是，我们也应该看到，还有一部分知识青年还没有认识参加劳动锻炼，同工农群众相结合的重要意义。他们认为自己有知识，架子放不下来。他们看不起工人农民，虽然口头上承认工人农民是物质财富和精神财富的创造者，可是却认为自己参加体力劳动是浪费光阴，同工农群众打交道没有意思。他们不知道劳动创造了人类，可是人类还要在以后的劳动中不断地改造自己。体力劳动是一切劳动的基础，是创造物质财富和精神财富的源泉，共产主义的重要特征之一，就是要把脑力劳动和体力劳动结合起来。体力劳动是光荣的高尚的事情。只有剥削者才把体力劳动看成是低下的和可怕的，极力想躲开它。我国各行各业的青年知识分子，都应当积极地自觉地去参加体力劳动，锻炼和改造自己成为与工农结合的，既有知识又善于劳动的工人阶级的知识分子。如果不在劳动中锻炼，如果不能同劳动群众打成一片，那末，学习马列主义，可能犯教条主义；学习数理，可能是“只专不红”；学习文学艺术，可能犯“一本书主义”；学习技术，可能是技术高于一切。而知识青年到劳动中去锻炼，同工农群众相结合，就能够防止和克服教条主义、一本书主义、技术高于一切等的错误观点，就将为思想上的彻底改造准备条件。
    知识青年到工农群众中去，同他们一道生产劳动，究竟是耽误了光阴？还是促进了成长？是有意思？还是没有意思？这样看来，回答是促进了成长，是很有意思。毛泽东同志早在1939年纪念五四青年节的时候就说过，“革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合。”广大的青年知识分子，在今天来重温一下毛泽东同志的指示，会更觉得亲切有味。许多上山下乡的知识青年，从他们的切身体会中，也告诉我们这一点。山东工学院一个学生帮助农业合作社拉白菜。他说，“我们现在才开始懂得俯首甘为孺子牛的意义，今后还要在各项工作中，一辈子永远做劳动人民的好儿女。”这是很好的想法。到劳动中去，同工农群众结合，正是知识分子思想作风得到根本改造的“必由之路”和“必修之课”。当前，凡具备体力劳动条件的机关青年，不能升学的中小学毕业生和其它知识青年，应该积极响应党的号召，下乡上山，到工农群众中去，到劳动中去改造自己。
    为了从思想上扫除同工农群众结合的障碍，积极参加体力劳动，广大青年还必须发扬“一二·九”运动的艰苦朴素、吃苦耐劳的优良作风。广大青年要学习革命先辈不怕艰难困苦的革命乐观主义精神，贯彻勤俭建国，勤俭办学，勤俭持家的精神，自觉地在生活中和斗争中锻炼自己，把自己培养成为有文化的劳动者。艰苦勤劳是我们克服困难，加速国家建设的伟大力量的源泉。我们要节约每一分资金投到建设中去，加速国家的积累，以便在最近几十年内把我国建设成为世界上一个最富强的国家。这是全国人民包括每一个青年的责任。我们相信，经过党的长期抚养的这一代青年，必定能够继承和发扬“一二·九”的革命传统，也一定愿意和能够下决心改造自己，成为自觉的建设社会主义的战士，负担起时代的使命，在共产主义的光明大道上奋勇前进！
