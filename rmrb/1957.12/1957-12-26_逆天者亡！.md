    Those Who Defy Heaven Shall Perish!
    By a commentator for this newspaper
    People all over the world want peace. Since the Moscow Conference of Communist and Workers' Parties, the efforts of socialist countries led by the Soviet Union to strive for peace and peaceful coexistence have promoted the entire world's peace movement. Even some people who used to advocate a "position of strength" policy have had to talk about peaceful coexistence. However, people cannot cease to be vigilant about the danger of war. There are indeed a small group of monopoly capitalists in the world who are calculating and acting against the will of heaven. The report of the American "Gaither Committee," revealed by "The Washington Post," has issued a warning to the people of the world: In the torrent of peace, a group of madmen suffering from war mania, for the sake of their moneybags, are stubbornly implementing plans to step up atomic war preparations, trying to push the world into the abyss of disaster.
    This "Gaither Committee," composed of a group of large American monopoly capitalists and government officials, had to admit in the face of the facts that the East wind has prevailed over the West wind, and lamented that the United States has been reduced to a second-rate country. But what lessons did they learn from this? Instead of abandoning the "position of strength" policy, acknowledging reality, and calmly sitting down to resolve disputes through negotiations, these war maniacs are viciously plotting a so-called "preventive war" – a war of so-called "preemptive strike."
    According to the logic of these maniacs: "In modern atomic warfare, the initial attack will be on such a massive scale that the attacking country may win in one fell swoop. Since the arms race is unfavorable to the United States, we must not sit and wait," but must carry out a "preventive war." Therefore, it proposed to increase the "initial operational capability" of the U.S. intermediate-range missiles to four times the current target, and to increase the capability of "intercontinental missiles" to almost ten times; therefore, it proposed to increase military spending by 20 billion yuan over a five-year period.
    This is what Eisenhower, Dulles, and their ilk are secretly doing while mouthing that they have no ambition to control the world, no intention of aggression, and hope the world will become a better paradise for everyone. The revelation of this conspiracy has understandably caused great shock among the American public, and even "The New York Post" exclaimed that this is a "mad" plan.
    Can a "preventive war" reverse the decline of the imperialist camp?
    It is not difficult for people to remember that Hitler once launched a "blitzkrieg" against the Soviet Union. In the first year of that war, Hitler was still in a superior position in terms of military technology. However, the result of the "preemptive strike" did not enable Hitler to win in one fell swoop, but ended in a disastrous defeat. The lessons of history have long revealed to people that victory ultimately belongs to the side of justice, and the outcome of war is determined by people, not by weapons. Moreover, according to the "Gaither Committee" itself, the United States has been reduced to a second-rate country militarily, and today is in a position of military inferiority! Furthermore, because the Soviet Union has the superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system, it can give full play to the advantages it has already gained in science and technology and develop at a speed that the United States cannot match. Even if the United States may one day reach the current level of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union will have gone far ahead. Therefore, it can be affirmed that American imperialism will never catch up with the Soviet Union. In this situation, if the United States once "strikes preemptively" and dares to launch an atomic war, its end will inevitably be self-destruction.
    It seems that it would be appropriate to send these war maniacs to the Elizabeth Psychiatric Hospital. If they are allowed to determine American policy, it will only bring unprecedented disaster to the American people. People must be vigilant against these maniacs who fantasize about launching a "preventive war."

    逆天者亡！
    本报评论员
    全世界人民要和平。从各国共产党和工人党莫斯科会议以来，以苏联为首的社会主义国家，争取和平，争取和平共处的努力，推动了整个世界的和平运动，甚至有些过去主张“实力地位”政策的人，也不得不谈和平共处了。可是，人们对于战争的危险却不能从此不加警惕，世界上确实还有一小撮垄断资本家，在打着如意算盘，逆天行事。“华盛顿邮报”透露的美国“盖瑟委员会”的报告，向全世界人民发出了警告：在和平的洪流中，一群患有战争狂热病的疯子，为了他们的钱口袋，顽固地执行着加紧原子备战计划，要把世界推到灾难的深渊里去。
    这个由美国一批大垄断资本家和政府官员组成的“盖瑟委员会”，在事实面前，不得不承认东风已经压倒西风，悲叹美国已经沦为二等国家。可是，他们从这里得到什么教训呢？这些战争狂人不是从此收起“实力地位”政策，承认现实，开始冷静地坐下来用谈判的方式解决争端，而是在穷凶极恶地策划着美其名的“预防性战争”——所谓“先发制人”的战争。
    按照这批狂人的逻辑：“现代的原子战争，首先进攻将是如此巨大规模，以致发动进攻的国家可能一举获胜。由于武器竞赛不利于美国，因此，我们万万不能坐着等待”，要进行“预防性战争”。于是，它提出要把美国的中程导弹的“初步作战能力”提高到目前目标的四倍，把“洲际导弹”的能力增加到差不多十倍；于是，它提出要在五年期间，增加军费二百亿元。
    这就是在艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯之流，口口声声没有控制全世界的野心，没有侵略意图，希望世界成为大家的更美好的乐土的时候，“绝密”地干着的勾当。这个阴谋的透露，何怪乎引起了美国公众的很大震动，何怪乎连“纽约邮报”也惊呼这是一个“疯狂”的计划。
    “预防性战争”能不能挽回帝国主义阵营的颓势呢？
    人们还不难记得，希特勒曾经发动过侵犯苏联的“闪电战”，在那战争的头一年里，从军事技术上来说，希特勒还居于优势地位。可是，“先发制人”的结果并没有能够使希特勒一举获胜，而是惨败了。历史的教训，早就揭示给人们，胜利最后属于正义的方面，战争的结局决定于人，而不决定于武器。何况，按照“盖瑟委员会”自己的说法，美国在军事上已沦为二等国，今天已居于军事劣势的地位了呢！何况，苏联由于有着社会主义制度比资本主义制度的优越性，它能充分发挥已经获得的科学技术上的优势，以美国望尘莫及的速度向前发展，往后即使美国将有一天可能达到现在苏联的水平，但那时苏联又远远地走到更前面去了。因之，可以肯定地说，美帝国主义是再也赶不上苏联的了。在这种情况下，美国如果一旦“先发制人”，胆敢发动原子战争，其结局必然是自取灭亡。
    看来，把这些战争狂人送到伊丽莎白精神病院去倒是合适的，要是让他们决定美国的政策，只会给美国人民带来空前的灾难。人们必须谨防这些妄想发动“预防性战争”的狂人。
