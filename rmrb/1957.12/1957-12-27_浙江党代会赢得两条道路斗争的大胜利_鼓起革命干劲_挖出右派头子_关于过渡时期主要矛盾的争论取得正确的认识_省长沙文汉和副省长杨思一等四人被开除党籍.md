Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, December 26th: The Second Congress of the Communist Party of China Zhejiang Province recently held its second session, where it discussed the current political situation in our country and the principal contradiction during the transition period. The meeting summarized the tremendous achievements of the rectification campaign, criticized the erroneous tendency to attempt to handle contradictions among the people by using methods designed for handling contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, and criticized right-leaning conservative viewpoints on all fronts of socialist construction.

One of the most important gains of the meeting was the exposure of the right-wing, anti-Party, and anti-socialist criminal activities of Sha Wenhan, member of the Provincial Party Committee Standing Committee and Governor of Zhejiang Province; Yang Si, member of the Provincial Party Committee Standing Committee and Deputy Governor of Zhejiang Province; Peng Ruilin, member of the Provincial Party Committee Standing Committee and Chief Procurator of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Procuratorate; and Sun Zhanglu, member of the Provincial Party Committee and Director of the Provincial Party Committee's Finance and Trade Department. The meeting unanimously passed a resolution to expel them from the Party.

Comrade Jiang Hua, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, delivered a lengthy report on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee, which was unanimously endorsed by the meeting.

The meeting was held in Hangzhou from December 9th to 13th. Seven hundred and two delegates attended the congress, and seven hundred and seventy-five people attended as non-voting participants, representing 200,115 official Party members and 100,628 probationary Party members in the province. Prior to the formal meeting, a preparatory meeting for the congress and a four-level cadre meeting were also held.

The congress conveyed and studied the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, used the methods of vigorous airing of views, big contending, big debate, and big-character posters to seriously review the work of the province since the last provincial Party congress closed more than a year ago, and discussed future tasks. Three hundred and thirty-two delegates made oral or written speeches at the congress and preparatory meeting. The congress was very enthusiastic, and debates were held on many important issues in the province's work. Various views and opinions were expressed, and finally, unity was achieved through debate, the political direction was corrected, the domestic and international situation was clarified, achievements were affirmed, shortcomings and errors were criticized, and the Party's unity was strengthened. The socialist consciousness and revolutionary enthusiasm of all delegates were greatly enhanced. The delegates unanimously agreed that this was a socialist revolution rectification congress, a socialist construction mobilization congress, and a historically significant congress of victory and unity for Zhejiang Province.

Comrade Jiang Hua delivered a work report to the congress on the 9th. In his report, he first talked about the rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle. He said that practice over the past year has proved that the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao are completely correct. As long as we grasp rectification, all our work will be significantly improved, and a lively new atmosphere will emerge.

Regarding the current situation, he pointed out, according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, that after the socialist revolution has basically completed in terms of the ownership of the means of production, the class struggle has not completely ended. The struggle between the bourgeoisie and proletariat, the struggle between the capitalist road and the socialist road, is still the main contradiction during the transition period, but this contradiction is mainly expressed not between the productive forces and the relations of production, but between the economic base and the superstructure.

He then pointed out that the struggle between the two roads can be expressed as contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, or as contradictions among the people. Under the current conditions in our country, the former is relatively rare, while the latter is abundant. The result of the anti-Rightist struggle proves that the majority of the masses can be trusted, and that the Rightists are, after all, an extremely small minority. Therefore, we must firmly believe in the majority of the masses. It is wrong to ignore the contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, but we must never exaggerate the strength of the enemy. We cannot regard the wavering and dissatisfaction of general bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals towards socialism, who do not belong to the Rightists, as contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, nor can we regard the wavering and dissatisfaction of well-to-do middle peasants towards socialism as contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, and wrongly use methods of resolving contradictions between ourselves and the enemy to deal with these contradictions.

He pointed out that the development of the situation is a process of ebb and flow, advancing in twists and turns. After the decisive victory in the anti-Rightist struggle, the class enemy was forced to retreat, and the struggle situation may ease for a certain period. However, the bourgeois Rightists and other anti-socialist elements will never be reconciled to their demise, and under certain conditions, they will launch new attacks on socialism. This undulating pattern of struggle will occur repeatedly over the next few years. Some comrades often fail to see this law of the development of the situation and oppose the anti-Rightist struggle to the correct handling of contradictions among the people, which is obviously wrong.

He said that the form of vigorous airing of views, big contending, big debate, and big-character posters is a new development in the Party's mass line working method. This method can not only correctly handle contradictions among the people, overcome shortcomings and errors in leadership, and overcome certain erroneous views of the masses; but also expose the enemy, mobilize and educate the masses to fight against the enemy. We must consciously learn to use this method in all our work and make it regular and traditional.

In his report, Comrade Jiang Hua also talked in detail about Zhejiang Province's rural work, industrial production and the working class, financial and trade work, intellectual and cultural and educational work, the bourgeoisie and democratic parties, military work, and Party work, and put forward future guidelines and tasks. In the Party work section, he made a profound explanation of the significance and lessons of the struggle against the Rightist elements Sha Wenhan, Yang Si, Peng Ruilin, and Sun Zhanglu. He particularly emphasized the necessity of resolutely opposing individualism, sectarianism, and localism.

After discussing Comrade Jiang Hua's report, the congress passed a resolution on the 13th, unanimously agreeing to the work report and instructing Party organizations at all levels in the province to conscientiously implement it.

After debate, the congress believed that in the past year or so, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Shanghai Bureau, Party organizations at all levels in Zhejiang Province have united the people of the province, worked diligently, and achieved great results. This is the basic aspect. Shortcomings and errors in work and at all levels of leadership also exist, but those are the secondary aspect. In 1957, the province achieved bumper harvests of grain, cotton, ramie, and oil crops. Tea, fisheries, and livestock and poultry such as pigs and sheep also increased compared with previous years. In areas such as Huangyan, Wenling, and the suburbs of Wenzhou, the average grain yield per mu has reached 800 jin, and in Cixi County, the average cotton yield per mu has reached more than 100 jin. A large number of "thousand-jin teams," "thousand-jin cooperatives," and "thousand-jin townships" have also emerged throughout the province.

These advanced areas have reached the targets set by the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) ten years ahead of schedule. Agricultural cooperatives throughout the province have been further consolidated, grain work has gradually become regularized, and relations between cadres and the masses have been greatly improved. Factories and mining enterprises throughout the province have made every effort to overcome the difficulties of insufficient raw materials and have launched an increase production and practice economy campaign, which has also achieved great results. The total value of industrial and handicraft output in 1957 is expected to exceed the target of the First Five-Year Plan by 10.12%. Investment in industrial capital construction has also greatly increased in recent years. Key projects such as the Xin'anjiang and Huangtankou hydropower stations, the Zhejiang Iron and Steel Plant, the Silk United Factory, and the Meat Processing Plant are under construction, and the Zhejiang Chemical Fertilizer Plant is being actively planned. The No. 1 blast furnace of the Shaoxing branch of the Zhejiang Iron and Steel Plant has produced the first batch of molten iron in Zhejiang's history. Cultural, educational, and health undertakings have also developed accordingly. Many villages that have eliminated illiteracy, townships that have eliminated schistosomiasis, and townships and towns that have basically eliminated mosquitoes and flies have emerged throughout the province. The cultural and health levels of the people of the province have been significantly improved. These facts fully demonstrate that the Party's guidelines, policies, and leadership are correct, while the right-leaning ideology that doubts the great achievements and great prospects of socialist construction is completely wrong.

The revolutionary enthusiasm stirred up by the congress was particularly evident in the discussion of the great leap forward in agriculture. Representatives from Jiaxing, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Jinhua, Jiande, and other regions unanimously proposed to strive to reach the target of 800 jin per mu of grain yield ahead of schedule in 1962. Representatives from Jinhua and Jiande also proposed a socialist emulation campaign to each other. The speeches of representatives from advanced areas such as Huangyan, Cixi, Shaoxing Donghu Farm, Qingtian Chuanliao District, and Jingning Cheng District were generally welcomed and valued. The representatives unanimously agreed that today there are advanced high-yield models in every region. As long as the leadership has a full spirit of revolutionary progress and adopts the method of the mass line, mobilizing the advanced to lead the backward and encouraging the backward to learn from and catch up with the advanced, it is entirely possible to reach the 800 jin target within the next five years. In order to achieve this goal, in addition to putting forward many measures to increase production, the representatives also wrote letters and telegrams to their respective counties, districts, and townships to seize the opportunity to supervise the current winter production and overfulfill the province's winter sowing plan ahead of schedule.

After vigorous airing of views, big contending, big debate, the congress used ample facts to prove that Sha Wenhan and Yang Si had degenerated into bourgeois Rightist agents within the Party and were using localist sectarianism to create divisions within the Party. The meeting also exposed a large number of facts about the anti-Party sectarian activities of Peng Ruilin and Sun Zhanglu. The meeting unanimously resolved to expel these ambitious elements who had persisted in their anti-Party stance for a long time from the Party and recommended to relevant departments that they be removed from all their administrative posts. The congress called on Party organizations and Party members throughout the province to fight for the consolidation of Party unity and solidarity in its resolution. The congress considered this to be a principled struggle between two roads within the Zhejiang Provincial Party organization. The victory of this struggle is of extremely great historical significance for consolidating and purifying the Party organization, strengthening the strong unity of Party organizations at all levels throughout the province under the unified leadership of the Central Committee, and enhancing the Party's combat effectiveness.

The congress also elected additional members to the Provincial Party Committee at the end.

    浙江党代会赢得两条道路斗争的大胜利
    鼓起革命干劲　挖出右派头子
    关于过渡时期主要矛盾的争论取得正确的认识
    省长沙文汉和副省长杨思一等四人被开除党籍
    新华社杭州26日电　在不久以前举行的中共浙江省第二届代表大会第二次会议上，讨论了我国目前的政治形势和过渡时期的主要矛盾问题。会议总结了整风运动的巨大成就，批判了那种企图用处理敌我矛盾的方法来处理人民内部矛盾的错误倾向，并且批判了在社会主义建设的各个战线上的右倾保守观点。
    会议的最重要收获之一是揭露了省委常委、浙江省省长沙文汉，省委常委、浙江省副省长杨思一，省委常委、浙江省人民检察院检察长彭瑞林，省委委员、省委财贸部部长孙章录的右派反党反社会主义的罪恶活动。会议一致通过决议把他们开除出党。
    省委第一书记江华同志代表省委在会议上作了长篇报告，这个报告受到会议的一致赞同。
    会议是12月9日到13日在杭州举行的。出席大会的代表七百零二人，列席七百七十五人，代表全省二十万零一千一百十五名正式党员和十万零六千一百二十八名预备党员。在正式会议举行以前，还召开了这次代表大会的预备会议和全省四级干部会议。
    这次大会传达和学习了党的八届三中全会的精神，运用大鸣大放大辩论和大字报的方法，认真地检查了上一次省的党代表大会闭幕后一年多来全省的工作，讨论了今后的任务。有三百三十二名代表在大会上和预备会议上作了口头或书面的发言。这次大会开得非常热烈，对全省工作中的许多重大问题展开辩论，讲出了各种不同的看法和意见，最后通过辩论得到了统一，端正了政治方向，认清了内外形势，肯定了成绩，批判了缺点和错误，从而加强了党的团结，大大地提高了全体代表的社会主义觉悟和革命干劲。代表们一致认为，这是一次社会主义革命的整风大会，是一次社会主义建设的动员大会，是浙江省一次具有历史意义的胜利和团结的大会。
    江华同志9日向大会作了工作报告。在他的报告中，他首先谈到整风运动和反右派斗争。他说，一年来的实践证明，党中央和毛主席的指示是完全正确的，只要抓住了整风，各项工作都获得显著的改进，出现了生动活泼的新气象。
    关于当前形势，他根据党中央和毛主席的指示指出：在生产资料所有制方面基本上完成了社会主义革命以后，阶级斗争并没有完全结束。资产阶级和无产阶级的斗争，资本主义道路和社会主义道路的斗争，仍然是过渡时期的主要矛盾，只是这种矛盾主要地不表现在生产力和生产关系之间，而表现在经济基础和上层建筑之间。
    他接着指出，两条道路的斗争既可以表现为敌我矛盾，也可以表现为人民内部矛盾。在我国目前条件下，前一种情况是比较少数的，后一种情况却是大量的。反右派斗争的结果证明：大多数群众是可以信赖的，右派分子毕竟是极少数。因此，必须坚定地相信群众的大多数。忽视敌我矛盾是错误的，但是决不能夸大敌人的力量。不能把不属于右派的一般资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子对于社会主义的动摇和不满看作敌我矛盾，也不能把富裕中农对于社会主义的动摇和不满看作敌我矛盾，错误地用解决敌我矛盾的方法来处理这些矛盾。
    他指出：形势的发展，是时松时紧、曲折前进的。在这次反右派斗争取得决定性胜利之后，阶级敌人被迫退却，斗争形势可能在一定时期缓和下来。但是，资产阶级右派和其他反社会主义分子决不甘心死亡，在某种条件下，又会向社会主义发起新的进攻。这种斗争的起伏形势，将在若干年内反复地发生。有些同志往往不看形势发展的这种规律，把反右派斗争和正确处理人民内部矛盾问题对立起来，这显然是错误的。
    他说，大鸣大放大争大辩和大字报这种形式，是党的群众路线工作方法的新发展。这个方法既可以正确处理人民内部矛盾，克服领导上的缺点和错误，克服群众的某些错误观点；又可以揭露敌人，动员和教育群众向敌人进行斗争。我们必须自觉地在各项工作中学会运用这种形式，并且使之经常化，使之成为传统。
    江华同志在报告中还详细地谈到了浙江省的农村工作、工业生产和工人阶级、财贸工作、知识分子工作和文教工作、资产阶级和民主党派、军事工作和党的工作，提出了今后的方针和任务。在党的工作部分，他对于反对右派分子沙文汉、杨思一、彭瑞林、孙章录等人的斗争的意义和教训作了深刻的说明。他特别着重地指出了坚决反对个人主义、宗派主义和地方主义的必要。
    大会在讨论了江华同志的报告以后，在13日通过决议，一致同意这个工作报告，并且责成全省各级党组织认真贯彻执行。
    大会经过辩论以后认为，一年多来，在党中央和上海局的正确领导下，浙江省各级党组织团结全省人民、勤勤恳恳地做了不少工作，获得了很大成绩，这是基本的方面。工作中和各级领导上的缺点和错误也是有的，那是次要的方面。1957年，全省粮食、棉花、络麻、油料都获得丰收，茶叶、渔业和猪羊等家畜家禽都比往年增产。黄岩、温岭和温州市郊区等地粮食平均每亩产量已经达到八百斤，慈溪县的棉花平均每亩产量达到一百斤以上，全省还出现了大批的千斤队、千斤社、千斤乡。
    这些先进地区都提前十年达到了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）规定的指标。全省农业合作社已经进一步巩固，粮食工作已经逐步走上正规，干部和群众的关系有了很大改善。全省各厂矿企业千方百计地克服原材料不足的困难，开展增产节约运动，也获得了很大的成绩。1957年工业和手工业总产值预计可以超额10.12％完成第一个五年计划的指标。几年来工业基本建设的投资也大大地增加了。新安江和黄坛口的水电站、浙江钢铁厂、丝绸联合厂和肉类加工厂等重点工程正在加紧建设，浙江化学肥料厂正在积极筹建。浙江钢铁厂绍兴分厂第一号高炉，已经炼出了浙江历史上的第一炉铁水。文教卫生事业也相应地发展了。全省已经出现不少消灭了文盲的村，消灭了血吸虫病的乡，基本上消灭了蚊蝇的乡和镇。全省人民的文化水平和健康水平显著地提高了。这些事实充分地说明党的方针政策和领导是正确的，而怀疑社会主义建设的伟大成就和伟大前途的右倾思想是完全错误的。
    大会鼓起的一股革命干劲，在讨论农业大跃进时表现得特别明显。嘉兴、宁波、温州、金华、建德等地区的代表一致提出要在1962年努力争取提前达到粮食亩产八百斤的指标。金华和建德两个地区的代表还相互提出社会主义竞赛。黄岩、慈溪、绍兴东湖农场、青田船寮区、景宁城区等先进地区代表的发言，普遍受到了欢迎和重视。代表们一致认为，今天各个地区都有先进的丰产典型，只要领导上有饱满的革命进取精神，采取群众路线的方法，发动先进的带动后进的，鼓励后进的学习和赶上先进的，是完全可能在今后五年之内达到八百斤指标的。为了实现这个指标，代表们除了提出许多增产措施以外，还特地写信、打电报到自己所在的县、区、乡抓紧督促当前冬季生产，提前超额完成了全省冬种计划。
    大会经过大鸣大放大争大辩，用充分的事实证明了沙文汉和杨思一已经堕落成为资产阶级右派在党内的代理人，并且用地方主义宗派主义的立场来制造党的分裂。会议同时揭发了彭瑞林、孙章录两人的反党宗派活动的大量事实。会议一致决议把这些在长期间坚持反党立场的野心分子清除出党，并且向有关方面建议撤销他们的一切行政职务。大会在决议中要求全省党组织和党员为巩固党的团结和统一而斗争。大会认为，这是浙江省党组织内一场两条道路的原则斗争。这场斗争的胜利，对于巩固和纯洁党的组织，加强全省各级党组织在中央统一领导之下的坚强团结，增强党的战斗力，具有极为重大的历史意义。
    这次代表大会最后还补选了省委委员。
