	Celebrating the Triple Good Harvest, Looking Forward to a Happy New Year
	A New Year's Gift
	Teachers and students of Peking University are actively preparing for New Year celebrations. The Student Union is planning to hold a costume party on New Year's Eve to celebrate the victory of the First Five-Year Plan. Students will dress up as intellectuals participating in labor in the countryside.
	Students of the Hindi Language Department of the Department of Eastern Languages will perform a modern Indian one-act satirical comedy, "The Protectors of Power." Indian expert Verma is the director of the play and has revised the script. The play also includes Indian dance, and expert Verma's wife, Ms. Alu, is teaching the female students to dance despite her hard work. Fourth-year students in the Urdu class of the Department of Eastern Languages will hold a poetry recital with Indian national characteristics. Teachers and students of the Philosophy Department will go to the Lianfeng Agricultural Cooperative on New Year's Day to hold a "Celebrating the Harvest, Welcoming the New Year" party.
	In order to implement the spirit of diligence and thrift in running the school, second-year students of the Chemistry Department are launching a waste iron collection campaign. They have now collected more than 400 kilograms of old iron wire, more than a dozen kilograms of steel pipes and water pipes, and more than 800 kilograms of hemp rope to hand over to the school as a New Year's gift. All students will also hold discussions on their gains in learning, work, and physical health over the past year, and look forward to 1958. (Jing Shan)
	Bring Out Good Programs
	The Student Union of the Renmin University of China and the student unions of various departments are actively preparing cultural and recreational programs to welcome 1958. The whole school has already carried out a general cleaning. Students thoroughly cleaned their dormitories, tidied up their stationery, and cleared campus garbage. These days, the Student Union has been soliciting New Year's performance programs from students and collecting excellent programs from brother schools.
	Some departmental committees of the school's trade union will organize members to go to the countryside before the end of the year to visit personnel who have been transferred to the countryside to participate in physical labor, and to offer condolences to their families. Some units will also hold parties with transferred cadres.
	The President will invite all international students to a tea party on New Year's Eve for a school-wide celebration.
	Preparing to Celebrate with Farmers
	To celebrate the New Year, the Beijing Mining Institute will invite farmers and cadres from nearby agricultural cooperatives to participate in the institute's New Year's cultural and recreational evening party on the evening of the 30th. On the morning of the 31st, students from various departments will be organized to carry out voluntary labor in nearby agricultural cooperatives. After the labor, small-scale celebrations will be held with the members. In the evening, the comrades of the agricultural cooperatives will be invited to the school by class to spend New Year's Eve with the students.
	These days, the Student Union of the Beijing Mining Institute and some cultural and recreational organizations are actively preparing for New Year's activities. The dance group, orchestra, and other five organizations are rehearsing, and the literary society is creating long narrative poems to be printed as New Year's cards to greet the classes. The cultural and recreational departments of various departments are also actively decorating the games rooms.
