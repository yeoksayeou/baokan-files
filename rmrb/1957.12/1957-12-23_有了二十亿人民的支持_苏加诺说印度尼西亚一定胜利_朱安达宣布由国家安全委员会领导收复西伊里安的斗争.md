Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 22nd -- President Sukarno said yesterday, when receiving Maria Maddalena Rossi, Vice-President of the Women's International Democratic Federation, that two billion out of the world's current two billion six hundred million people support Indonesia's struggle.

Rossi (Italian) was invited to come here to participate in the Third National Congress of the Indonesian Women's Movement Association.

Rossi told President Sukarno that although Italy participates in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Italian people fully support the Indonesian people's struggle to recover West Irian. She said she believes that Indonesia's struggle will be victorious.

President Sukarno expressed his pleasure at Rossi's words. The President said that the Indonesian people's struggle will surely be victorious. He also said that he will always stand with the Indonesian people and the peace-loving people of the world to fight for the defense of world peace and the struggle for social prosperity.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 22nd -- Indonesian Prime Minister Djuanda announced to reporters on the 21st that Indonesia's struggle to recover West Irian will henceforth be led by the Indonesian National Security Council. Prime Minister Djuanda also announced that the West Irian Liberation Action Committee, which had led this struggle in the past, has been dissolved.

The members of the National Security Council, led by Djuanda, include: three deputy prime ministers and several cabinet ministers, the chiefs of staff of the three armed services, the prosecutor general, the inspector general of police, and the minister of information. Minister of Information Sudibjo is the chairman of the dissolved West Irian Liberation Action Committee.

Prime Minister Djuanda delivered a radio address on the evening of the 21st, asking the Indonesian people to endure the temporary difficulties caused by the struggle against Dutch colonialism. Prime Minister Djuanda pointed out that the current struggle is to accelerate the recovery of West Irian, improve the national economy and Indonesia's international position, and more freely implement an independent foreign policy. Djuanda pointed out that certain difficulties have arisen due to the struggle for the liberation of West Irian. The difficulties caused by the suspension of ships of the Dutch Royal Shipping Company are more serious, and the government is trying to overcome these difficulties.

Djuanda emphasized that the original form of relations between Indonesia and the Netherlands cannot continue. Continuing economic and trade relations between Indonesia and the Netherlands would bring greater harm to Indonesia. Prime Minister Djuanda said that in the past, the Netherlands had extracted 1 billion guilders of profit from Indonesia every year, and 50,000 Dutch expatriates lived a luxurious life in Indonesia.

    有了二十亿人民的支持
    苏加诺说印度尼西亚一定胜利
    朱安达宣布由国家安全委员会领导收复西伊里安的斗争
    新华社雅加达22日电  苏加诺总统昨天在接见国际民主妇女联合会副主席玛丽亚·玛达琳娜·罗西的时候说，目前在全世界二十六亿人中有二十亿人民支持印度尼西亚的斗争。
    罗西（意大利人）应邀来到这里参加印度尼西亚妇女运动协会第三次全国代表大会。
    罗西对苏加诺总统表示，虽然意大利参加了北大西洋公约组织，但是意大利人民完全支持印度尼西亚人民为收复西伊里安而进行的斗争。她说，她相信印度尼西亚的斗争会取得胜利。
    苏加诺总统对罗西的话表示高兴。总统说，印度尼西亚人民的斗争一定能够取得胜利。他还说，他将永远同印度尼西亚人民和世界爱好和平的人民站在一起，为保卫世界和平和争取社会繁荣而斗争。
    新华社雅加达22日电  印度尼西亚总理朱安达21日向新闻记者宣布，印度尼西亚为收复西伊里安而进行的斗争今后将由印度尼西亚国家安全委员会领导。朱安达总理同时宣布，过去一个时期领导进行这一斗争的解放西伊里安行动委员会已经解散。
    由朱安达领导的国家安全委员会的成员包括：三位副总理和几位内阁部长、三军参谋长、检察总长、警察总监、情报部长。情报部长苏迪比约是已经宣告解散的解放西伊里安行动委员会主席。
    朱安达总理在21日晚间发表了广播演说，要求印度尼西亚人民忍受由于开展反对荷兰殖民主义者的斗争而引起的暂时困难。朱安达总理指出，目前的斗争是为了加快收复西伊里安、改善国家经济和印度尼西亚的国际地位，以及更自由地执行独立的外交政策。朱安达指出，由于进行解放西伊里安的斗争，已经产生了某些困难。由于荷兰皇家轮船公司的轮船停驶，在航运方面引起的困难比较严重，政府正在设法克服这种困难。
    朱安达强调说，印度尼西亚同荷兰之间的关系的原有形式是不能继续下去了。继续印度尼西亚同荷兰的经济与贸易关系就会给印度尼西亚带来更大的危害。朱安达总理说，过去荷兰每年从印度尼西亚攫取十亿盾的利润，有五万荷兰侨民在印度尼西亚过着豪华的生活。
