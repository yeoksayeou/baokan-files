　　The 60th meeting of the State Council plenary session adopted the draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, which is published in the newspaper today and will be submitted to the next meeting of the National People's Congress for discussion and approval. The formulation and implementation of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is an important task of current writing reform and a major event in the cultural life of our people.
　　To reform Chinese characters, making them easier for the broad masses of people to master and more convenient for expressing ideas, popularizing and improving national culture, has been a long-standing wish of the Chinese people. From the end of the Qing Dynasty, advanced figures at the time had proposed reforms to Chinese characters and made various attempts. The phonetic unification and national language movement produced after the 1911 Revolution, the later national language Romanization movement and the Latinized New Writing movement, as well as the simplified characters and shorthand characters that emerged from the masses, all played a certain role in reforming Chinese characters. Sixty years of writing reform work have accumulated many experiences and lessons, paving the way for solving the problem of writing reform in the future.
　　After the national liberation, writing reform became one of the projects of socialist cultural construction. The Party and the government have adopted a positive and steady approach to the work of writing reform. It must be recognized that the current work of writing reform is not to abolish Chinese characters and replace them with phonetic writing, but to improve the currently used Chinese characters to make them more convenient for the broad masses of people to learn and use, and at the same time to gradually unify the spoken language of the Han nationality. As for whether Chinese characters should be reformed into phonetic writing, it needs to be continuously studied and discussed over a longer period, but this is a different kind of problem and not what the current writing reform is to solve.
　　The current writing reform work includes three main tasks: (1) simplifying Chinese characters, that is, simplifying the strokes and number of Chinese characters, to facilitate teaching and application of Chinese characters; (2) popularizing Putonghua with Beijing pronunciation as the standard sound, to gradually unify the common language of the Han nationality; (3) formulating and implementing a set of phonetic alphabets for phonetic transcription of Chinese characters and to help teach Putonghua, that is, the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme.
　　Since the National Writing Reform Conference in October 1955, the writing reform work has made great progress in implementing the above three tasks. First, let's talk about the work of simplifying Chinese characters. In January 1956, the State Council announced the Chinese Character Simplification Scheme, of which the officially promoted in newspapers and periodicals is the first table of Chinese character simplification, listing 230 characters, and 125 characters selected from the second and third tables by analogy, totaling 355 characters. The number of simplified characters is not large, but because these characters are relatively commonly used, they greatly reduce the difficulty for children and adults to recognize and write characters in language teaching. Except for a few simplified characters that still have some shortcomings, the vast majority of the characters are welcomed by the broad masses of people, and people from all walks of life feel convenient.
　　On the other hand, the simplification of Chinese characters has also produced some malpractices. Some people have gone beyond the scope of the "Chinese Character Simplification Table" announced by the State Council and even arbitrarily created new simplified characters, destroying the norms of writing, for example, "舞会 (dance party)" is written as "午会", "书籍 (books)" is written as "书借", "乾隆 (Qianlong)" is written as "干隆". In order to overcome the chaotic phenomenon of writing Chinese characters, the Chinese Writing Reform Committee must re-examine and reorganize the simplified Chinese characters that have been promoted and those that have been tried by the masses but not yet adopted by newspapers and periodicals, and make a complete simplified Chinese character table for publication. When re-examining and reorganizing, the simplified characters that have been adopted but have shortcomings should be changed to more appropriate simplified characters, or the original characters should be retained. After the simplified Chinese character table is formulated and published, it should be stipulated that all newspapers and periodicals and publications in the country (ancient books and other publications with special properties can be regarded as exceptions) should adopt it uniformly, or adopt it in batches, to strive for the standardization of Chinese character forms. Language teachers and publishing and printing workers should pay close attention to avoid arbitrarily creating simplified characters and writing wrong characters.
　　The standardization of Chinese character forms will not restrict intellectuals, especially calligraphers. Calligraphy, as an art, is a characteristic of Chinese characters. After the simplification of Chinese characters, calligraphers can still write various fonts according to their own preferences. But this is only a matter for a few people, and writing is for hundreds of millions of people to learn and use. From the practical point of view of the vast majority of people, stipulating simplified Chinese characters is only beneficial and not harmful.
　　Second is the promotion of Putonghua. After 1956, the central government and most provinces and cities have established working committees for the promotion of Putonghua. In the past two years, about 600,000 primary and secondary school teachers across the country have received training in Beijing pronunciation, and a large part of primary and secondary schools across the country have begun to use Putonghua for teaching. In addition, millions of people have learned Putonghua through broadcasting. Preliminary experience shows that it is not difficult to promote Putonghua and teach Beijing pronunciation in cities and in primary and secondary schools, and the masses welcome it. In rural areas, especially among adults, it takes more time to promote it, and it should not be rushed.
　　Chinese language needs to have a unified standard for the whole nation in terms of phonetics, grammar, and vocabulary, to facilitate the development of production, popularization and improvement of culture, which is an inevitable trend. But to make nearly 600 million Han people, in addition to speaking their own dialects, be able to master the standard pronunciation and use a common spoken language, is an arduous task and cannot be achieved in a short period. This work is only at the beginning now, and we must make long-term unremitting efforts in the future. It must also be recognized that promoting Putonghua does not mean abolishing dialects, which cannot be done objectively. In a considerable period of time in the future, Putonghua and local dialects can coexist without conflict, and Putonghua should try to absorb the rich and vivid vocabulary in dialects as much as possible, to make the common language of the Han nationality more enriched and developed.
　　Third, the formulation and implementation of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme. To create a set of phonetic alphabets for Chinese language to facilitate the learning of Chinese characters and Chinese language has been the consistent advocacy of language workers and educators for sixty years. The national phonetic alphabet formulated by the Phonetic Unification Association in the era of the Northern Warlords, as well as the later national language Romanization and the Latinized New Writing of Northern Dialect, have all made attempts at Chinese phonetic transcription. Among them, the phonetic alphabet has played a certain advanced role in unifying pronunciation and assisting literacy education, and is still used as a phonetic tool for language teaching and editing dictionaries. The disadvantage of the phonetic alphabet is that the glyphs are not easy to distinguish and it is relatively difficult to write. After liberation, after long-term research and discussion by language workers and people from all walks of life across the country, it was finally decided to use the internationally used Latin alphabet (also known as the Roman alphabet) as the Chinese phonetic alphabet to replace the original phonetic alphabet. The draft now announced by the State Council completely uses Latin letters as the initials and finals of Chinese language, and the spelling rules are relatively simple. Adults and children can master this set of phonetic alphabets after about a month of teaching. Adults with phonetic knowledge can learn faster.
　　Why use Latin letters instead of other letters as the phonetic alphabets of Chinese language? This is because there are many conveniences in using Latin letters. Most modern countries use Latin letters to spell their own languages, and mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology generally use Latin letters as writing symbols; international telecommunications use Latin letters as codes. In addition, many ethnic minority languages in our country have already been spelled with Latin letters. Spelling Chinese characters with Latin letters is more convenient in terms of typing, printing and other practical aspects. The Latin alphabet is in fact an internationally used writing symbol, not exclusive to a certain country or a certain nation. Our use of Latin letters to transcribe Chinese characters is just like our use of the Gregorian calendar, kilometers, kilograms, and meters, which does not conflict with national cultural habits, but greatly facilitates the cultural exchange between our country and the world.
　　The main purpose of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is to transcribe Chinese characters phonetically, to help learn characters and unify pronunciation. With this set of phonetic alphabets, primary and secondary school students and adults who are new to culture can read phonetically transcribed Chinese character reading materials, and gradually recognize more Chinese characters by recognizing and remembering a few Chinese characters. In literacy teaching, it can help recognize and remember characters and distinguish sounds. In addition, editing dictionaries, bibliographies, indexes, as well as telegrams and shorthand, are much more convenient with phonetic alphabets.
　　Chinese characters use glyphs to express word meanings, and people who speak different pronunciations can use the same Chinese characters as a communication tool, which is a great advantage of Chinese characters. But on the other hand, because Chinese characters are not phonetic writing, as a result of language evolution, the pronunciation is not unified, and people use their own dialects to read the text, which hinders the gradual unification of pronunciations in various regions. After Chinese characters are transcribed phonetically with phonetic alphabets, people in different dialect areas will master the common standard pronunciation after learning Chinese characters. People who have not learned Chinese characters will easily learn Putonghua and easily recognize Chinese characters after learning phonetic alphabets. Phonetic alphabets are an indispensable tool for teaching Putonghua. The formulation of the phonetic scheme will greatly promote the work of promoting Putonghua.
　　The Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme is an auxiliary tool for teaching Chinese characters and Chinese language, and therefore it is also welcomed by domestic ethnic minorities and international friends who want to learn Chinese characters and Chinese language. Ethnic minorities in our country can use Chinese phonetic alphabets as a common foundation for creating and reforming their own ethnic languages, which is conducive to mutual learning and communication among people of all ethnic groups. In science and technology, phonetic alphabets can be used to write terms and symbols; it is conducive to the improvement of the cultural level of the broad masses of people and the mastery of modern scientific knowledge.
　　The purpose of creating phonetic alphabets and stipulating Chinese character simplification is the same, both are to serve Chinese characters, to enable more people to learn and use Chinese characters. After the implementation of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, there will be more people learning Chinese characters, not less. Some people think that writing reform will make people who have already recognized Chinese characters become illiterate, which is a great misunderstanding. Of course, experts in language and writing can use phonetic alphabets to study the further reform of Chinese writing, but this is academic work and does not belong to the scope of writing reform work currently promoted by the government, and should not and will not be confused with the current tasks of writing reform.
　　Writing reform is closely related to the cultural traditions and living habits of the broad masses of people. Various writing reform schemes must be repeatedly studied by language experts, discussed with the participation of the broad masses, and implemented nationwide after a period of trial implementation. The draft of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme now announced was made by the Chinese Writing Reform Committee by summarizing the various experiences of creating Chinese phonetic alphabets over a long period of time, made the original draft, and from February 1956, submitted it to the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and local committees to organize people from all walks of life to discuss, and widely solicited the opinions of language workers, language teachers and other relevant people, and underwent several revisions in the middle, and then the State Council organized the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme Review Committee to review it, and only in the last month the results of the review were submitted to the plenary meeting of the State Council for adoption. This draft has been studied by experts and discussed by the masses for a long time, and it is relatively mature, although the scheme itself may still have some shortcomings, it can still be gradually revised in practice in the future. In order to be cautious, the plenary meeting of the State Council decided to submit this draft to the next meeting of the National People's Congress for discussion and approval, and then gradually promote it in literacy education, promotion of Putonghua, publishing work, etc., which is completely correct.

　　当前文字改革的任务和汉语拼音方案
    国务院全体会议第六十次会议通过了汉语拼音方案草案，于本日在报上公布，以后还要提交全国人民代表大会下一次会议讨论和批准。制定和推行汉语拼音方案是当前文字改革的一项重要任务，是我国人民文化生活中的一件大事。
    改革汉字，使其更容易为广大人民所掌握，更便利于表达思想、普及和提高民族文化，是中国人民长久以来的一种愿望。从清朝末年起，当时的先进人物就曾经提出改革汉字的主张，并且作过各种不同的尝试。辛亥革命以后所产生的读音统一和国语运动，后来的国语罗马字运动和拉丁化新文字运动，以及从人民群众中间产生的简笔字和手头字，对于改革汉字都起过一定的作用。六十年来的文字改革工作，积累了许多经验和教训，为今后解决文字改革问题开辟了道路。
    全国解放以后，文字改革成为社会主义文化建设的项目之一。党和政府对于文字改革工作，采取了积极的稳步前进的方针。必须认识，当前的文字改革工作，不是为了废除汉字而代之以拼音文字，而是为了改良现在通用的汉字，使其更便利于广大人民群众的学习和使用，同时逐步统一汉民族的口头语言。至于汉字是否改革成拼音文字，需要在一个更长的时间内继续研究讨论，但这是另一种性质的问题，不是当前文字改革所要解决的问题。
    当前的文字改革工作包含三项主要的任务：（1）简化汉字，就是简化汉字的笔画和字数，以便利教学汉字和应用汉字；（2）推广以北京语音为标准音的普通话，以逐渐统一汉民族的共同语言；（3）制定和推行一套拼音字母，为汉字注音和帮助教学普通话，即汉语拼音方案。
    1955年10月全国文字改革会议以后，文字改革工作，在贯彻执行以上三项任务方面，有很大进展。首先说一说汉字简化工作。国务院于1956年1月公布汉字简化方案，其中已经报刊正式推行的是汉字简化第一表所列二百三十字和从第二表及第三表类推选出的一百二十五字，合计三百五十五字。简化的字数不多，但因为这些字都是比较常用的，在语文教学方面，大大减少了儿童和成年人认字、写字的困难。除其中个别的简化字还有一些缺点外，绝大部分的字都受到广大群众的欢迎，各方面人士都感到方便。
    另一方面，汉字简化也产生了一些流弊。有些人超出了国务院公布的“汉字简化表”的范围，甚至任意创造新的简字，破坏了书写的规范，例如“舞会”写成“午会”，“书籍”写成“书借”，“乾隆”写成“干隆”。为了克服书写汉字的混乱现象，中国文字改革委员会必须把已经推行的和已经群众试用而尚未经报刊采用的简化汉字，从新加以审订整理，制成完整的简化汉字表，予以公布。在从新审订整理的时候，对于已经采用但有缺点的简化字，应该改为较恰当的简化字，或者保留原字。简化汉字表制定公布之后，应当规定在全国报刊和出版物上（古籍及其他性质特殊的出版物可以作为例外），一律采用，或者分批采用，以力求汉字形体的规范化。语文教师和出版印刷工作者应当密切注意，避免随意创造简笔字和书写错别字。
    汉字形体的规范化并不会使知识分子，特别是书法家受到限制。书法作为一种艺术，是汉字的一个特点。汉字简化之后，书法家仍然可以依照各人的爱好，书写各种字体。但这究竟只是少数人的事，而文字是要为亿万人民群众所学习和使用的。从极大多数人的实用意义来说，规定简化汉字只有好处，没有坏处。
    第二是推广普通话。1956年以后，中央和大部分省市都已经成立了推广普通话工作委员会。在过去两年中，全国约有六十万中小学教师，受过北京语音的训练，全国中小学校，很大一部分开始用普通话进行教学。此外，通过广播学习普通话的有几百万人。初步经验证明，在城市中间和在中小学中间推广普通话，教北京语音，困难不大，群众是欢迎的。在农村中特别是在成人中推行，需要较多的时间，不宜要求过急。
    汉语在语音、语法、语汇上，要有一个全民族通行的统一标准，以利于发展生产、普及和提高文化，这是必然的趋势。但是要使近六亿的汉民族，除了讲各人自己的家乡话以外，人人都能掌握标准语音，使用一种共同的口头语，是一项艰巨的工作，不能要求在短时期内达到目的。现在这一项工作只是在开端，今后必须作长期的不懈的努力。还必须认识，推广普通话并不是就要废除方言，这是在客观上所不能办到的。在今后相当长的时期内，普通话和各地方言可以并行不悖，并且普通话应当尽量吸取方言中的丰富的生动的语汇，使汉民族的共同语言更加充实和发展。
    第三，制定和推行汉语拼音方案。为汉语创制一套拼音字母，以利于学习汉字和汉语，这是六十年以来语文工作者和教育工作者所一致主张的。在北洋军阀时代由读音统一会制定的国语注音字母，以及后来的国语罗马字和北方话拉丁化新文字，都曾经作过汉语拼音的尝试。其中注音字母，在统一读音和辅助扫盲教育这方面，起过一定的先进作用，至今被用作语文教学和编辑字典的注音工具。注音字母的缺点是字形不易分辨，书写比较困难。解放以后，经语文工作者和全国各界人士的长期研究和讨论，最后才决定了以国际通用的拉丁字母（又称罗马字母）作为汉语拼音字母，以代替原来的注音字母。现在由国务院公布的草案，完全用拉丁字母作为汉语的声、韵母，拼写规则比较简便，成人和儿童，经过一个月左右的教学，就可以掌握这一套拼音字母。有拼音常识的成年人学起来更快一些。
    为什么不用别种字母而用拉丁字母来作为汉语的拼音字母呢？这是因为采用拉丁字母有许多方便。现代极大多数的国家采用了拉丁字母来拼写本国语文，数学、物理、化学、生物学，一般都用拉丁字母作为书写符号；国际电信用拉丁字母作为电码。此外，我国少数民族文字已经有许多种用拉丁字母拼写。用拉丁字母拼写汉字，在打字、印刷及其他实用方面都比较便利。拉丁字母事实上是一种国际通用的书写符号，不是某一国家、某一民族所专有的。我们采用拉丁字母来为汉字注音，正像我们用公历、公里、公斤、公尺一样，和民族文化习惯并没有抵触，而对于促进我国和国际的文化交流有很大的便利。
    汉语拼音方案的用途主要是为汉字注音，来帮助识字和统一读音。有了这一套拼音字母，中小学生和初学文化的成年人，可以阅读注音的汉字读物，由认记少数汉字，逐渐认记更多的汉字。在扫盲教学中，可以帮助识字记字和辨音。此外，编辑字典、书目、索引以及电报、速记等方面，有了拼音字母都要方便得多。
    汉字用字形来表达字义，操不同语音的人们可以用同一种汉字作为交际工具，这是汉字的很大的优点。但是另一方面，由于汉字不是拼音文字，语言演变的结果，读音不统一，人们都用自己的方音来阅读文字，这样就妨碍了各地语音的逐步统一。汉字用了拼音字母来注音之后，不同方言地区的人们，学了汉字以后，就掌握了共同的标准语音。没有学过汉字的人，学了拼音字母，也就容易学会普通话，并容易认识汉字。拼音字母是教学普通话所不可缺少的工具。拼音方案的制定对于推广普通话的工作，将起极大的推动作用。
    汉语拼音方案是教学汉字和汉语的辅助工具，因此也是为要求学习汉字汉语的国内兄弟民族和国际友人所欢迎的。我国各少数民族创制和改革本民族的文字，可以把汉语拼音字母作为共同的基础，这就有利于各族人民之间的互相学习和沟通。在科学技术上，可以用拼音字母来书写术语和符号；有利于广大人民的提高文化水平和掌握现代科学知识。
    创制拼音字母和规定汉字简化，这两件事的目的相同，都是为汉字服务，为了使更多的人们学会汉字和使用汉字。汉语拼音方案推行以后，学汉字的人是更多而不是更少了。有些人以为文字改革将使已识汉字的人成为文盲，这是极大的误会。当然，研究语文的专家可以使用拼音字母来研究中国文字的进一步改革，但是这是学术性的工作，不属于政府当前所推行的文字改革工作的范围，不应该也不会与当前文字改革的任务混淆起来。
    文字改革和广大人民的文化传统和生活习惯密切相关。文字改革的各种方案必须经过语文专家的反复研究，广大群众的参加讨论，经过若干时期的试行，才能推行全国。现在公布的汉语拼音方案草案，是由中国文字改革委员会总结了过去长时期中创制汉语拼音字母的各种经验，制成了原草案，从1956年2月起，就提请政协全国委员会和各地方委员会，组织各界人士进行讨论，并且广泛征询了语文工作者、语文教师和其他有关人士的意见，中间经过数度修改，然后由国务院组织汉语拼音方案审订委员会加以审订，到了上月间才将审订的结果提到国务院全体会议通过。这个草案经过长时间的专家钻研和群众讨论，是比较成熟的，尽管方案本身可能还有一些缺点，日后在实践中仍然可以逐步修正。为了力求审慎起见，国务院全体会议决定，把这个草案提请全国人民代表大会下次会议讨论和批准，然后在识字教育、推广普通话、出版工作等方面逐步推行，这是完全正确的。
