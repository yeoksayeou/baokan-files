Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, December 13th: Syrian Army Commander and Chief of Staff, General Bizri, stated in a declaration to Syrian officers and soldiers and People’s Anti-Enemy Army political workers of both sexes on the 12th that imperialism has not abandoned its conspiracy to subvert Syria and is still seeking opportunities to undermine Syria's independence and unity.

    Bizri called: "Be vigilant and do not allow the enemy any opportunity to exploit. Be prepared at all times and do your utmost to carry out your tasks well."

    Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, December 13th: The Syrian Special Military Tribunal began hearing on December 11th the American conspiracy case uncovered in mid-August this year, which attempted to subvert the current Syrian government.

    The Special Military Tribunal is located in Damascus. Five defendants appeared in court for trial. One of the defendants, former Captain Mustafa Malki, confessed that he had met with an official of an American intelligence agency at the Semiramis Hotel in Damascus and had received money from him.

    Malki had previously been accused in a conspiracy case organized by the British.

    Some defendants were not present for trial because they had fled abroad. These defendants include: former Syrian President Adib Shishakli, former Syrian military attaché to the Italian Embassy Ibrahim Husseini, and Colonel Muhammad Naimah, who recently escaped from prison.

    After conducting preliminary interrogations of the defendants, the court announced that it would continue the hearing on December 14th.
