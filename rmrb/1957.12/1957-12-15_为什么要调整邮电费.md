　　Why Adjust Postal and Telecommunications Fees?
　　Commentator of this newspaper

The State Council has approved the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications' adjustment of postal and telecommunications fees starting from January 1st next year. Postal and telecommunications fees are related to the state's price policy; they are related to the communication between various organizations, groups, and enterprises, and the daily life of the broad masses of people; they are also related to the rational use and future development of various postal and telecommunications tools. In the past period, people have raised many opinions about some unreasonable phenomena in postal and telecommunications fees, such as some being too high or too low. This time, with the aim of fully leveraging the role of postal and telecommunications equipment and facilitating mutual contact between various organizations and enterprises and the broad masses of people, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has adjusted remittance fees, postage for parcels and printed matter, and various incidental fees such as insurance and return receipts in the postal sector. In the telecommunications sector, it has adjusted domestic telegrams, domestic long-distance calls, and local telephone fees. After this adjustment, the rates have been unified, prominent unreasonable phenomena have been eliminated, and the calculation standards and procedures have been simplified. The impact on the income of postal and telecommunications enterprises and the burden on users is not significant. We believe that this adjustment of postal and telecommunications fees will surely give greater play to the role of postal and telecommunications in serving socialist construction.

What unreasonable phenomena exist in the current postal and telecommunications fees?

First, they cannot adapt to the new situation of the basic victory of the socialist revolution and the rapid development of socialist construction. The current postal and telecommunications fees were mostly formulated in the early days of liberation. At that time, there were still various forms of ownership in our country's economy, and the transportation and economic conditions in various regions were also very uneven. The postal and telecommunications fees formulated at that time reflected the social and economic conditions and the government's policies at that time. For example, because capitalist ownership still existed at that time, in order to restrict the development of capitalism, some postal and telecommunications fees adopted different methods for public and private ownership, which was necessary at that time. For another example, because transportation conditions in provinces such as Gansu, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou were very inconvenient, in order to prevent postal and telecommunications enterprises from suffering excessive losses, the postage for printed matter in these regions was charged at one or two times the postage standard for general regions, which was also necessary at that time. However, at present, the social situation in our country has undergone fundamental changes, the socialist revolution in the economic sphere has achieved a basic victory, and the First Five-Year Plan has been completed and overfulfilled. Although postal and telecommunications fees have also been revised to some extent, the fundamental situation has not changed, so that in the new situation, some postal and telecommunications fees seem very unreasonable. Since the situation of multiple economies basically no longer exists, the method of differentiating between public and private ownership is outdated. Since the transportation conditions in provinces such as Gansu, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou have greatly improved, and transportation costs have been reduced compared with the past, it is unreasonable to still charge one or two times the standard postage for printed matter in general areas.

Second, national rates are not unified. The lack of unified rates is not only manifested in the fact that different regions have different charging standards and large price differences, but also in the fact that different business objects have different charging standards. The differences in rates between regions and between different business objects are sometimes reasonable. For example, since transportation conditions in remote areas such as Xinjiang and Qinghai are different from those in the interior, the postage for parcels is also different, which is reasonable. In order to take care of the interests of the blind, the postage for reading materials for the blind is lower than the postage for general printed matter, which is also reasonable. However, there are also many rate differences between regions and between different business objects that are unreasonable or difficult to implement. For example, long-distance telephone fees are 59% higher on average in East China than in North China. Calling from Shanghai to Beijing costs nine yuan for every three minutes, but calling from Beijing to Shanghai only costs five yuan and fifty cents for the same three minutes. For example, in the same Inner Mongolia region, the telegraph fees in the east and west are different, with the former being lower and the latter being higher, with a large difference. These are clearly unreasonable. For example, the difference in rates between military and government agencies and enterprise departments has proven over the years that it is sometimes difficult to clearly distinguish the nature of military and government agencies and enterprise departments, which is not easy to implement and even often causes misunderstandings. Now it seems that in order to take care of the needs of military and government agencies to convey orders and instructions, preferential treatment can be given in the order of transmission rather than in terms of fees.

Third, some postal and telecommunications fees are too high, and some are too low. The fees that are too high are mainly telegram fees. For example, sending an urgent coded enterprise telegram of 1,100 characters from Chongqing to Beijing costs 54 cents per character, totaling 594 yuan, which is even more expensive than a round-trip plane ticket between Beijing and Chongqing. The fees that are too low are mainly postage for parcels and monthly local telephone rental fees. The current ordinary parcel fee is calculated according to the freight rates of the transportation department and does not include the internal handling fees of postal and telecommunications enterprises for receiving, transporting, and loading and unloading parcels. In addition, the pricing unit for postal parcels is lower than the transportation regulations, so the fee is too low. The monthly local telephone rental fee often does not cover the cost of equipment maintenance and results in annual losses, which is also clearly too low. In addition, the postage for printed matter, except for the higher fees in provinces such as Gansu, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou, is also somewhat too low in other regions because the average delivery mileage has increased by nearly double compared to the past. As for the current remittance fee, regardless of the amount remitted, a fee of two jiao is charged for each transaction, resulting in a high burden for small remittances and a low burden for large remittances, which has long been reflected by the masses and repeatedly requested for improvement.

These unreasonable phenomena in postal and telecommunications fees not only cause uneven burdens on users, but also are not conducive to communication between various parties. High postal and telecommunications fees prevent postal and telecommunications equipment from being used rationally and hinder postal and telecommunications enterprises from playing a broad role in serving the people. For example, high domestic telegram fees cause users to switch to using long-distance telephones, resulting in an unbalanced load on telegram and long-distance telephone equipment, with surplus telegram equipment and personnel, while long-distance telephones are in short supply. However, long-distance telephone equipment requires large investments and has high costs, and it will be impossible to fully meet the needs in the future. Low fees do not conform to the principles of business operation, are not conducive to the development of postal and telecommunications services, and will cause various wastes. For example, low postage for parcels causes some unnecessary items to be mailed by the post office, increasing the burden on the transportation department. There is no reason to continue using these unreasonable postal and telecommunications fees. The State Council's approval of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications' adjustment of postal and telecommunications fees starting from January 1st next year to change this unreasonable phenomenon is a major rectification measure in the postal and telecommunications department's rectification movement and is entirely necessary.

This adjustment of postal and telecommunications fees reflects the superiority of our country's socialist system and reflects the government's care for the burden of the majority of the masses. After the remittance fee is changed to 1% of the remittance amount, the remittance fee for small remittances of 20 yuan or less is lower than the current two jiao: this part of the remittance accounts for 55% of the total number of remittances issued throughout the year, and this regulation takes care of the majority of remitters. After the adjustment of ordinary parcel postage, in some areas, it is slightly higher than the current postage, which is conducive to the rational use of the country's transportation forces; however, the postage for postal parcels under three kilograms is generally still lower than the transportation department's freight rates. For example, according to the new standard, the ordinary parcel postage from Beijing to Shanghai is still 25% lower than the railway ordinary parcel freight, which takes into account that the parcels received and sent by the post office are mainly personal, scattered, and self-use items and the cost burden of the masses. As for the postage for parcels sent to areas with inconvenient transportation and border areas, it has generally not changed, and some have even been reduced, especially the postage for air parcels has been generally reduced, and the postage for parcels sent over long distances has been reduced even more. Sending an air parcel of three kilograms from Beijing to Urumqi is 44% lower than the current postage, which takes into account the need to support the economic construction of border areas and strengthen the political, economic, and cultural exchanges between the people of the interior and the people of the border areas. After the adjustment of domestic telegram fees, ordinary clear telegrams have been reduced from 13.5 fen per word to 3 fen per word, and urgent coded telegrams have been reduced from 54 fen per word to 6 fen per word, which is a very large reduction and greatly facilitates telegram communication between agencies, enterprises, and the broad masses of people. In addition, the fees for mail return receipts, remittance return receipts, and reissuing duplicate receipts, mail or remittance inquiry fees, fees for changing the name and address of the recipient and withdrawing mail application fees, fees for changing the amount of the collected payment for goods, and fees for applying for telegraphic transfer change, refund, or extension of payment have all been reduced. The postage for reading materials for the blind is already lower than the postage for general printed matter, and it will be reduced according to the new regulations. Remittances for the families of martyrs will continue to be sent free of charge. Similar measures to take care of the majority of people and take care of special circumstances can also be found in this adjustment plan for postal and telecommunications fees.

In this adjustment of postal and telecommunications fees, some of the fees that were too low have also been increased, and the postal and telecommunications fees borne by some users have been increased due to changes in the zoning and classification methods and the unification of national rates. These can be understood by the masses as long as they are carefully explained. For example, after the remittance fee is changed to 1% of the remittance amount, the remittance fee for people remitting more than 20 yuan has increased, and the increase in the remittance fee for people remitting more than 100 yuan is relatively large. Is this adjustment reasonable? We believe it is reasonable. Remitting more money and paying more fees is one reason; the larger the remittance amount, the heavier the responsibility borne by the post office, and more remittance fees should be charged, this is another reason. Moreover, although the remittance fees paid by people remitting more than 20 yuan have increased, the remittance fees for most people have not increased by more than two jiao; only a small number of people remitting large amounts have increased their remittance fees by more than two jiao. In the past, the monthly local telephone rental fee used whether or not there was a business nature as the user classification standard. Users without a business nature were classified as Class A users and charged lower fees; users with a business nature were classified as Class B users and charged higher fees. However, because the definition of business nature was not clear, disputes often arose. Agencies, schools, and organizations used telephones no less frequently than other users, but they were classified as Class A users because they did not have a business nature and charged lower fees, which was unreasonable. The new regulations reclassify users according to the principle of using more and paying more, classifying the two types of users, residences and dormitories, who generally use telephones less frequently, as Class A users and charging lower fees; and classifying other users as Class B users and charging higher fees. In this way, the fees borne by the original Class A users such as agencies, schools, and organizations, who have been changed to Class B users, have increased somewhat, but this increase is reasonable. Because the more times a local telephone is used, the greater the mechanical wear and tear, and the higher the maintenance cost, the more units that use telephones more frequently should pay.

After this adjustment of postal and telecommunications fees, calculated based on the volume of business in 1957, the increased income and reduced income of postal and telecommunications enterprises will be reduced by 2.08 million yuan. Although this reduces the state's financial revenue, the figure is not large after all, but it is conducive to communication between various parties and the broad masses of people, so it is permissible. If it is required to reduce postal and telecommunications fees even more, it is impossible and unreasonable from the perspective of the country's current economic situation; even if it is reluctantly reduced, it will not be possible to complete the task well due to the limitations of postal and telecommunications equipment. Of course, because the postal and telecommunications industry involves a wide range of issues, the issue of postal and telecommunications fees is very complicated, and it is difficult to make a single adjustment completely perfect and satisfy all parties. This requires appropriate individual adjustments in the future.

Our country's postal and telecommunications industry has made great progress in recent years, especially after the construction during the First Five-Year Plan, a national postal and telecommunications network has been initially established. The fragmented postal and telecommunications situation in old China has been completely changed. The postal and telecommunications network centered on Beijing and connecting all parts of the country makes Beijing and all parts of the country connected. Every county seat and district can now be reached by telegram and telephone. The material conditions for the postal and telecommunications industry to better serve the people are quite available. This adjustment of postal and telecommunications fees has opened up a better situation for giving better play to the role of postal and telecommunications and better serving the people from the system. All employees of the postal and telecommunications department must quickly learn and master the new postal and telecommunications fee standards, further correct their service attitude, improve the quality of their work, and better undertake the task of communication throughout the country.

　　为什么要调整邮电费
　　本报评论员
    国务院批准邮电部自明年1月1日起调整邮电费。邮电费关系到国家的价格政策；关系到各个机关、团体、企业之间的通信联系和广大人民群众的日常生活；也关系到各种邮电通信工具的合理使用和今后的发展。过去一个时期，人们对邮电费中某些偏高、偏低等不合理的现象，曾经提出很多意见。这次，邮电部本着充分发挥邮电通信设备的作用，便利各个机关企业之间和广大人民群众之间相互联系的目的，在邮政方面，调整了汇兑费、包裹和印刷品邮件的邮寄费以及保价、回执等各项附带费，在电信方面，调整了国内电报、国内长途电话和市内电话费。经过这次调整，统一了费率，消除了突出的不合理现象，简化了计费标准和手续，对于邮电企业的收入和用户负担影响都不大。我们相信，这次邮电费的调整，必能更大地发挥邮电通信为社会主义建设服务的作用。
    现行的邮电费存在着哪些不合理的现象呢？
    第一是不能适应社会主义革命取得基本胜利和社会主义建设迅速发展的新的形势。现行的邮电费，大多是在全国解放初期制定的。当时我国还存在着多种经济的所有制，各地的交通情况和经济情况也很不平衡。那时候制定的邮电费，反映着那时候的社会情况、经济情况和政府在那时候的政策。例如由于当时还存在着资本主义所有制，为了限制资本主义的发展，部分邮电费采取了公私有别的办法，这在当时是必要的。又例如由于甘肃、四川、云南和贵州等省的交通条件很不方便，为了不使邮电企业亏损过大，这些地区的印刷品寄费采取了按一般地区的寄费标准加一倍或两倍收费的办法，这在当时也是必要的。但目前我国的社会情况已经发生了根本性的变化，经济上的社会主义革命已经取得基本胜利，第一个五年计划已经完成和超额完成，而邮电费虽然也有若干修改，但根本情况并未改变，以致在新的形势下，某些邮电费显得很不合理。多种经济的情况既然已经基本上不存在了，公私有别的办法就过时了。甘肃、四川、云南和贵州等省的交通情况既然有了很大的发展，运输费用已比过去降低，印刷品寄费仍按一般地区的标准加一倍或两倍收费，也就不合理了。
    第二是全国费率不统一。费率不统一不只表现为各个地区有不同的收费标准，有很大的差价，而且还表现为各个不同的业务对象，有不同的收费标准。地区之间和不同业务对象之间费率的差别，有些是合理的。例如由于新疆、青海等边远地区的交通条件同内地不同，包裹寄费也有所不同，这是合理的。为了照顾盲人利益，盲人读物的寄费比一般印刷品的寄费低，这也是合理的。但也有很多地区之间和不同业务对象之间的费率差别，是不合理的，或者是不容易执行的。例如长途电话费，华东比华北平均高59％。从上海往北京打电话，每三分钟为一次，需付费九元；从北京往上海打电话，同样每三分钟一次，却只需五元五角。又例如同一个内蒙地区，东部和西部的电报费不同，前者低，后者高，差别很大。这些显然是不合理的。又例如军政机关和企业部门之间费率的差别，几年来的经验证明，由于军政机关和企业部门的性质有时很难划分清楚，贯彻起来很不容易，甚至经常为此发生误会；现在看来，为了照顾军政机关传达命令指示的需要，可以不在费用上给予优待，而在传递次序上优先处理。
    第三是有些邮电费偏高，有些偏低。偏高的，主要是电报费。例如从重庆发一份一千一百字的加急密语企业电报到北京，每字五角四分，共需付费五百九十四元，竟比京渝来往飞机票还贵。偏低的，主要是包裹寄费和市内电话月租费。现行普通包裹费，是按照运输部门的运价核订的，没有计算邮电企业收取、搬运和装卸包裹等内部处理费用，加上邮政包裹计价单位低于运输规定，因此收费偏低。市内电话月租费则常常不敷设备维护费用的支出，年有亏损，显然也是偏低的。此外，印刷品邮费，除了甘肃、四川、云南和贵州等省偏高外，其他地区的印刷品邮件，由于平均寄递里程比过去增加将近一倍，邮费又有些偏低。至于现行的汇费，不论汇款额大小，每笔收费两角，造成小额汇款负担偏高，大额汇款负担偏低的现象，则是群众早有反映，一再要求改进的。
    邮电费中这种种不合理的现象，不只造成了用户负担的畸轻畸重，而且不利于各方面的通信联系。邮电费偏高使邮电通信设备不能得到合理的运用，妨碍了邮电企业发挥广泛为人民服务的作用。例如国内电报费过高，用户转向使用长途电话，就造成电报和长途电话设备负荷的不平衡状态，电报设备和人员有余，长途电话却出现了供不应求的紧张情况；而长途电话的设备投资大，成本高，在今后一个时期内是不可能完全满足需要的。费偏低了又不符合企业经营的原则，不利于邮电事业的发展，并且会造成种种浪费。例如包裹的寄费偏低，社会上有些不必要邮寄的物品，也交由邮局寄递了，增加了运输部门的负担。这种种不合理的邮电费，是没有理由再继续沿用下去的。国务院批准邮电部自明年1月1日起调整邮电费，改变这种不合理的现象，是邮电部门整风运动中一项重大的整改措施，是完全必要的。
    这次邮电费的调整，体现了我国社会主义制度的优越性，体现了政府对多数群众负担的照顾。汇兑费改按汇款额1％收取后，二十元以下的小额汇款者的汇费都低于现行的两角：这部分汇款占全年开发汇票总数的55％，这个规定就照顾了大多数汇款者。普通包裹寄费调整后，在某些地区，比现行的寄费略有提高，这对于合理使用国家的运输力量是有利的；但三公斤以下邮政包裹的寄费，一般仍低于运输部门的运费。例如按照新的标准，由北京寄往上海的普通包裹寄费，还比铁路普通包裹运费低25％，这就照顾到邮局收寄的包裹主要是个人零星自用物品和群众费用负担的情况。至于寄往交通不便的和边疆地区的包裹寄费，一般都没有变动，甚至有些还降低了，特别是航空包裹寄费普遍降低，远距离寄递的包裹寄费降低的幅度更大，从北京寄往乌鲁木齐一件三公斤的航空包裹，比现行的寄费降低44％，这就照顾到支援边疆地区经济建设和加强内地人民与边疆人民之间政治、经济、文化交流的需要。国内电报费调整后，寻常明语电报由每字一角三分五厘降为每字三分，加急密语电报由每字五角四分降为每字六分，幅度极大，这就大大便利了机关、企业以及广大人民群众之间的电报通信。此外，邮件回执、汇款回帖、补发副执据的资费，邮件或汇款查询费、更改收件人姓名地址及撤回邮件申请费、更改代收货价金额手续费、电汇改汇、退汇或展期兑款申请费等都降低了。盲人读物的邮费已低于一般印刷品邮费，按照新的规定还要降低。烈士遗款则继续免费寄递。类似这种照顾多数人、照顾特殊情况的措施，还可以在这次邮电费的调整方案中找到很多。
    在这次邮电费的调整中，也有一些偏低的提高了，还有一些用户负担的邮电费，由于改变分区、分类的办法，统一全国的费率而提高了。这些，只要经过细心的解释，群众是可以理解的。例如汇费改按汇款额1％收取后，汇款二十元以上的人汇费都有增加，其中汇款一百元以上的人，汇费增加的幅度比较大。这种调整合理不合理呢？我们认为是合理的。多汇款、多付费，这是其一；汇款额愈大，邮局所负担的责任也愈重，应该收取较多的汇费，这是其二。况且二十元以上的汇款者所支付的汇费虽然有所增加，但多数人增加的汇费不超过二角钱；增加汇费二角以上的，只是少数大额汇款者。市内电话月租费，过去以有无营业性质作为用户分类标准。没有营业性质的用户为甲种用户，收费较低；有营业性质的用户为乙种用户，收费较高。但由于营业性质的定义不明确，常常引起争执。机关、学校、团体使用电话的次数不比其他用户少，却因没有营业性质列为甲种用户，收费少，这是不合理的。新的规定以多使用、多付费的原则重新划分用户类别，将一般说来使用电话次数较少的住宅和宿舍两类用户列为甲种用户，收费较低；将其他用户列为乙种用户，收费较高。这样，机关、学校、团体等原来的甲种用户改为乙种用户，负担的费用是增加了一些，但这种增加是合理的。因为市内电话使用的次数越多，机械的损耗越大，维护费用也越大，使用电话次数多的单位应该多付费。
    这次邮电费调整之后，按照1957年的业务量计算，邮电企业增加的收入和减少的收入数字相抵，还要少收二百零八万元。这对国家来说，虽然是减少了财政收入，但数字毕竟不大，却有利于各方面和广大人民群众的通信联系，因而是可以允许的。如果要求把邮电费降得更多一些，从目前国家的经济情况来看，是不可能的，也是不合理的；即便勉强降下来，由于邮电设备的限制，也不可能很好地完成任务。当然，由于邮电事业牵涉的面很广，邮电费问题十分复杂，一次调整很难十分完善，使各方面都很满意。这就需要在今后一定时期内再作适当的个别调整。
    我国邮电事业这几年来有了很大的发展，特别是经过第一个五年计划期间的建设，一个全国范围的邮电通信网已经初步建立起来。旧中国支离破碎的邮电通信状况已经完全改变了。以北京为中心的沟通全国各地的邮电通信网，使北京和全国各个地区脉脉相通，每个县城和区现在都可以通达电报和电话了。邮电事业更好地为人民服务的物质条件已经相当具备了，这次邮电费的调整，又从制度上开辟了一个更好地发挥邮电通信的作用，更好地为人民服务的境地。邮电部门的全体职工，必须迅速学习和掌握新的邮电费标准，进一步端正服务态度，提高工作质量，更好地担负起全国范围内的通信联系任务。
