　　Strengthen Leadership, Tap Potential, Promote Advanced Experiences
　　Henan Province's Great Leap Forward in Cotton Production
    (Our Report) This year, Henan Province experienced a Great Leap Forward in cotton production, with a bumper harvest on 13.4 million mu of cotton fields across the province. The unit yield increased by 25.7% compared to the first year of the First Five-Year Plan, and the total output increased by 52.6%, exceeding the actual output of last year by more than 70 million jin, surpassing the state's First Five-Year Plan target.

    According to preliminary statistics, the average per-mu yield of ginned cotton in cotton-growing areas of Anyang, Shanxian, Huojia, Xinye, Puyang, Xin County, Lingbao, Nanyang, Qingfeng, and the suburbs of Xinxiang City all exceeded 40 jin, with the suburbs of Anyang City reaching over 60 jin. There were also 3,682 agricultural cooperatives with a per-mu yield of ginned cotton exceeding 40 jin. Among them, 2,801 cooperatives yielded between 40 and 60 jin; 796 cooperatives yielded between 60 and 80 jin; 71 cooperatives yielded between 80 and less than 100 jin; and 14 cooperatives yielded over 100 jin. Furthermore, according to information from 77 state-owned farms growing cotton, 20 farms had a per-mu yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton.

    Henan Province's cotton yield this year is not only the highest since liberation but also of particularly good quality. The characteristics are: high ginning percentage, long fiber, and white color. This year, the ginning percentage of cotton is generally around 35%, with the ginning percentage of Daizi cotton approaching 40% in many areas. Last year, top-grade fine white cotton accounted for 96.7% of the total purchased by the state during the same period, which rose to 99.7% this year; the grade of fine cotton has improved by two levels compared to the past.

    This province has seen many unprecedented examples of high cotton yields this year. Xinxiang, Huojia, Shanxian, and Lingbao, well-known cotton-producing areas nationwide, were this province's two key demonstration areas for controlling cotton pests this year. After thoroughly controlling cotton pests by using highly toxic concentrated pesticides, the average per-mu yield of ginned cotton on 300,000 mu of cotton fields reached 60 to 70 jin, generally increasing by about 30% compared to last year. The per-unit yield of 31,000 mu of cotton fields in Xiaoji Township, Xinxiang County, increased by 54.5% compared to last year. Nanyang Prefecture, a historically low-yield cotton area, has seen party and government leaders personally take charge in recent years, establishing specialized cotton planting organizations, strengthening technical instruction, and promoting advanced cotton planting experiences from Xinjiang. This year, the average per-mu yield of ginned cotton in the entire prefecture exceeded 31 jin, an increase of two times compared to 1952 and 58% compared to last year. Among them, Xinye, Nanyang, and Deng Counties increased by one and a half times compared to 1953, completely and thoroughly changing the face of low yields. The Sixth Agricultural Cooperative of Tangzhuang Township, Shangshui County, which had no cotton planting experience, grasped the key to increased production through water and fertilizer, averaging 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu on 22 mu of cotton fields. Although Taikang Laozuka Township suffered a severe flood, the 12,500 mu of cotton fields in the township still achieved a yield of 73 jin of ginned cotton per mu due to timely pest control and phased application of fertilizer. The Yuhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Linru, located in the hills where the cultivated land mostly consists of nodular limestone and red clay, after improving the soil, selecting excellent varieties, implementing close planting, and engaging in intensive cultivation, also averaged 50.5 jin of ginned cotton per mu on more than 2,800 mu of cotton fields. In Huqiao Township, Xia County, where the soil is sandy and alkaline, after improving the soil and engaging in intensive cultivation on the 73 mu of cotton fields being experimentally planted, the average yield was more than 40 jin of ginned cotton per mu. The cotton yield facts of many agricultural cooperatives prove that as long as leadership is strengthened, potential is tapped, and reliance is placed on increasing yield per unit area, cotton production can be greatly developed.

    加强领导　挖掘潜力　推广先进经验
　　河南棉花生产大跃进
    本报讯　今年，河南省棉花生产大跃进，全省一千三百四十万亩棉花获得大丰收。比第一个五年计划的第一年单位产量提高25.7％，总产量提高52.6％，较去年实产增加七千多万斤，超额完成了国家第一个五年计划指标。
    据初步统计，全省有安阳、陕县、获嘉、新野、濮阳、新县、灵宝、南阳、清丰和新乡市郊的棉花，平均亩产皮棉都在四十斤以上，安阳市郊高达六十斤以上；亩产皮棉四十斤以上的还有三千六百八十二个农业社。其中，四十斤到六十斤的二千八百零一个社；六十斤到八十斤的七百九十六个社；八十斤以上不到一百斤的七十一个社；一百斤以上的十四个社。另据七十七个种植棉花的地方国营农场了解，亩产百斤皮棉的有二十个农场。
    河南省今年的棉花产量不仅是解放以来最高的一年，而且质量也特别好。特点是：衣分率高、绒长、色泽白。今年棉花的衣分率普遍在35％左右，很多地区岱字棉的衣分率接近40％。去年同期国家收购的细白绒棉占总收购量的96.7％，今年上升到99.7％；细绒棉的品级比过去提高了两级。
    这个省今年出现了许多空前未有的棉花丰产典型。全国闻名的新乡、获嘉及陕县、灵宝老产棉区，今年是这个省的两个重点治棉虫示范区，通过使用巨毒浓药彻治棉虫之后，三十万亩棉田平均亩产皮棉六十到七十斤，一般地比去年增产30％左右。新乡县小冀乡三万一千亩棉田单产比去年提高54.5％。历史上棉花低产区的南阳专区，由于近几年来，党、政领导亲自动手，建立了植棉专业组织，加强了技术传授，推广了新疆植棉先进经验，今年全区平均单产皮棉三十一斤多，比1952年增产二倍，比去年增产58％；其中新野、南阳、邓县比1953年增产一倍半，全面彻底改变了低产面貌。没种棉习惯的商水县汤庄乡第六农业社，由于抓住了水和肥的增产关键，在二十二亩棉田内平均每亩收皮棉一百斤。遭受特大水灾的太康老塚乡，因为及时地除治虫害和分期追施肥料，全乡一万二千五百亩棉田，仍获亩产皮棉七十三斤的产量。位于丘陵而耕地多系?礓石和红粘土的临汝玉皇农业社，在二千八百多亩棉田内，经过改良土壤、选用优良品种，实行密植和精耕细作之后，平均每亩也收皮棉五十斤半。土质系沙碱地的夏邑胡桥乡，在试种的七十三亩棉花地内，经过改良土壤、精耕细作以后，平均每亩产皮棉四十多斤。许多农业社的棉花丰产事实证明，只要加强领导，挖掘潜力，依靠提高单位面积产量，棉花生产是可以大大发展的。
