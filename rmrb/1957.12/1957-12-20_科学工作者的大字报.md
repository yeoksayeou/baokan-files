Big Character Posters from Scientific Workers

    How to Treat the Country's Urgent Tasks
    The preparatory work for the Institute of Automation and Remote Control and the Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences was an urgent task of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1957. The original plan was to formally establish the two institutes in 1957. However, now that 1957 is almost over, the two institutes have not yet been established, and there is no news about the candidates for the directors. Is this the attitude one should have towards the country's urgent tasks?
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Institute of Mechanics　Qian Xuesen

    Lacking a Socialist Drive
    With the call to catch up with or approach the world's advanced levels in the most urgently needed and important scientific fields within twelve years, coupled with the already formulated twelve-year long-term plan, it stands to reason that scientific research personnel should have a goal and a direction to strive towards and should work actively. However, most of the research personnel in our institute lack a socialist drive. For example, for a certain sample annealing, it could have been completed in one go in twenty-four hours, but it was dragged out. The power was switched on at 8 a.m., and it took until 10 a.m. to reach the required temperature. At 12 p.m. when the quitting work bell rang, the furnace was stopped, and then another three hours were spent in the afternoon. This extended the work by five days. There are also those who let precious time slip away unnoticed while reading newspapers, smoking, drinking tea, and chatting... Now, one-sixth of the twelve years has passed. At this rate, when will we catch up with the world's advanced levels?! There are different reasons for the lack of a socialist drive, and it is worth examining.

    Two Suggestions
    The National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) has been published. The Party and the government call on us scientific workers to give it our full support. In order to ensure that this glorious task is truly reflected in the plans of our relevant research units, I suggest:

    1. During the upcoming review of the 1958 research plan, please pay special attention to whether the research plans of the relevant units are closely linked to the tasks in the Forty Articles Program. If there is no connection or insufficient attention, the unit should be asked to reconsider and formulate the plan.

    2. When deploying the second five-year plan, please ask the Academy and the Department to put forward clear and specific requirements for the research units related to the Forty Articles Program.

    怎样对待国家的紧急任务
    中国科学院自动化及远距离控制研究所和计算技术研究所的筹备工作是中国科学院1957年紧急任务，原来计划1957年内正式成立两所。但是，现在1957年快完了，而两所还未成立，连所长的人选也无消息。这是对待国家紧急任务应有的态度吗？　力学研究所　钱学森
    缺少一股社会主义的劲
    十二年内在最急需最重要的科学方面赶上或接近世界先进水平，有了这样一个号召，再加上已经制订十二年长远规划，照理说，科学研究人员有了目标，有了奔头，应该积极努力。可是我们所里大部分研究人员缺乏一股社会主义的劲。譬如：某一次试样退火，本来可以一口气二十四小时干完，但是拖拖拉拉地从上午八点推上电门，加热到十点才达到所需温度，十二点下班铃响了停炉，下午再来个三小时，这样就延长干了五天。也还有让大好光阴在看报、抽烟、喝茶、聊天……中不留任何痕迹地滑过去了。现在十二年已经过了六分之一，这样下去，何日才能赶上世界先进水平？！缺乏一股社会主义的劲，原因各有不同，值得检查。　金属研究所　谭丙煜
    两条建议
    全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）发表了。党和政府号召我们科学工作者全力予以支援。为了使这项光荣的任务名副其实地在我们各有关研究单位的计划中得到体现，我建议：
    一、在即将开始的审查1958年研究计划工作中，请各学部委员特别注意各有关单位的研究计划是否密切联系四十条纲要中的任务。如果没有联系或注意的不够，应请该单位重新考虑制订。
    二、在布置第二个五年计划时，请院和学部对四十条纲要有关的研究单位，提出明确、具体的要求。
