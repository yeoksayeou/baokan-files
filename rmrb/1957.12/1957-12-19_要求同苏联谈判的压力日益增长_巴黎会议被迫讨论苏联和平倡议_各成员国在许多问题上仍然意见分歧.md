Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 18th dispatch: The foreign ministers of the fifteen member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization held a secret meeting on the morning of the 17th to study the important political and economic problems facing the bloc. In the afternoon of the same day, the heads of government of the bloc held their second working meeting to hear and discuss the results of the foreign ministers' studies. According to information revealed by various parties, countries are striving to "coordinate" their divergent views on some important issues and are preparing a communiqué including a so-called "agreement in principle."

    In the nearly three-hour foreign ministers' meeting on the 17th, a large portion of the time was spent studying the issue of disarmament and the peace initiatives proposed by the Soviet Union in its recent letters to the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Observers pointed out that the Polish proposal, supported by the Soviet Union, regarding the establishment of a zone without atomic weapons in Central Europe, was not originally intended to be discussed, but it was precisely this proposal that sparked heated debate at the meeting.

    According to reports, some delegations believed that the Polish proposal was worth studying. Some countries also insisted on slowing down the US plan to establish missile bases in order to engage in contact with the Soviet Union. They feared that a missile race would stifle opportunities for negotiations with the Soviet Union. Canadian Foreign Minister Smith advocated that the West should seek to resume disarmament negotiations with the Soviet Union either within or outside the United Nations. French Foreign Minister Pineau suggested that the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, France, Canada, and the Soviet Union hold negotiations on disarmament issues. Pineau's suggestion was supported by British Foreign Secretary Lloyd.

    After the foreign ministers' meeting, the heads of government meeting again discussed disarmament and the Soviet government's letters. According to authoritative sources, as a result of the discussions, the meeting reached a general agreement on a "two-pronged" plan: on the one hand, it called for a "cautious exploration" of the possibility of negotiations with the Soviet Union and instructed the Permanent Representatives Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to formulate a common policy to deal with the Soviet proposals; on the other hand, it called for strengthening the military "strength" of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization with modernized new weapons.

    The Associated Press pointed out in a commentary that the pressure to try again to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union is growing. In some important countries, such as West Germany, Britain, Canada, and the Scandinavian countries, there is increasing social pressure in favor of trying again to stop the arms race. In this situation, it is difficult for the United States to dismiss the Soviet peace initiatives as mere "propaganda." The news agency also pointed out that the United States' acceptance of such a compromise is clearly aimed at allowing the military to continue to implement the plan to transport ballistic missiles to Western Europe.

    In addition to the above issues, the foreign ministers' meeting and the subsequent heads of government meeting also discussed the German question, the Middle East question, the North African question, the relationship between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other military blocs, and the issue of "political consultation" within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

    It is said that on many issues, countries still have differences and have not yet reached a consensus.

    要求同苏联谈判的压力日益增长
    巴黎会议被迫讨论苏联和平倡议
    各成员国在许多问题上仍然意见分歧
    据新华社18日讯　巴黎消息：北大西洋集团十五个成员国的外交部长在17日上午举行秘密会议，研究这个集团所面临的重要政治、经济问题。当天下午，这个集团的政府首脑举行第二次工作会议，听取和讨论了外交部长们研究的结果。根据各方透露的情况，各国正在一些重要问题上竭力“协调”它们的分歧的主张，并且着手准备一项包括所谓“原则协议”的公报。
    在17日将近三小时的外交部长会议中，有很大一部分时间用来研究裁军问题和苏联在最近给北大西洋集团各成员国的信件中所提出的和平倡议。观察家指出，原来不打算讨论受到苏联支持的关于在中欧建立不安置原子武器的地区的波兰建议，可是正是这个建议在会上引起了热烈的争辩。
    据报道，某些代表团认为，波兰的建议是值得研究的。还有些国家坚持放慢美国关于建立导弹基地的计划，以便同苏联进行接触。它们害怕进行导弹竞赛会扼杀同苏联谈判的机会。加拿大外交部长史密斯主张，西方应该谋求在联合国内或者联合国外同苏联恢复裁军谈判。法国外交部长比诺建议美、英、法、加、苏五国外交部长就裁军问题举行谈判。比诺的建议得到英国外交大臣劳埃德的支持。
    在外交部长会议后，政府首脑会议又就裁军和苏联政府的信件进行了讨论。据权威人士透露，讨论结果，会议已经就一项“双管齐下”的计划达成一般性协议：一方面，要求“谨慎地探讨”同苏联谈判的可能性，并且指示北大西洋集团常任代表理事会拟定对待苏联建议的共同政策；另一方面，又要求以现代化新武器来加强北大西洋集团的军事“实力”。
    美联社在评论中指出，要求重新尝试同苏联取得协议的压力日益增长。在某些重要国家，如西德、英国、加拿大、斯堪的纳维亚国家，有越来越大的社会压力赞成重新尝试制止军备竞赛。在这种情况下，美国很难把苏联的和平倡议说成仅仅是“宣传”。这家通讯社还指出，美国接受这样一个折衷办法，显然是着眼于要让军人继续执行把弹道导弹运往西欧的计划。
    除上述问题外，外交部长会议和随后的政府首脑会议还讨论了德国问题、中东问题、北非问题、北大西洋集团同其他军事集团的关系问题以及在北大西洋集团内部进行“政治协商”问题等。
    据说，在许多问题上，各国仍然存在着分歧，仍然没有取得一致意见。
