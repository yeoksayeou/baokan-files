Xinhua News Agency, Linyi. The Dushan Agricultural Cooperative in Junan County, Shandong Province, through a major debate, overcame complacency and determined that next year's average grain yield per mu will reach 612.5 jin, an increase of more than 40% compared to this year.

　　In recent years, the Dushan Cooperative has carried out production reforms with the spirit of "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," increasing grain production year by year and changing the face of the barren mountainous area. This autumn, when the cooperative was discussing and formulating next year's grain production increase plan, many cooperative cadres and members developed a sense of complacency as a result. For example, some said: "Most of the members of our cooperative have built new houses, every household has added floral quilts and new clothes, and there is more than enough grain to eat. It's already very good now, and further increasing production won't change that."

　　In order to correctly solve this problem, the cooperative's management committee held several members' meetings for a major debate. Through the debate, the cooperative cadres and members not only understood the completion of the plan to produce an average of 612.5 jin of grain per mu next year and became more motivated, but also put forward amendments to the measures to be taken to achieve this goal. Based on these opinions, the cooperative committee revised the original plan to build six new reservoirs this winter and spring to nine, to raise 300 more pigs, and also prepared to strive to make all 2,000 mu of wheat in the cooperative reach 200 jin per mu.

　　In order to achieve next year's grain production target, all of the cooperative's more than 900 male and female members are attending work, setting off a winter production upsurge. At present, 152 mu of land in the cooperative have been deeply ploughed and improved; 35 mu of land have been created by cutting ridges, filling gullies, leveling high ground and filling low-lying areas; and achievements have also been made in watering and topdressing wheat fields.

　　自满不得！
　　大辩论明确方向大山社继续前进
    据新华社临沂讯　山东省莒南县大山农业社通过大辩论，克服了满足于现状的思想后，确定明年粮食每亩产量平均达到六百一十二点五斤，比今年增产四成多。
    几年来，大山社以“愚公移山”的劲头进行生产改革，使粮食产量逐年增加，改变了贫瘠的山区面貌。今秋这个社在讨论制定明年粮食增产计划时，不少社干部和社员曾因此产生了满足于现状的思想。如有的说：“我们这个社大部分社员都修建了新屋，家家户户都添置了花被和新衣，粮食也是有吃有余，现在已经很不错了，再增产也是那样。”
    这个社的管理委员会为了正确解决这一问题，曾多次召开社员大会进行大辩论。经过辩论，社干部和社员不仅对完成明年平均每亩产粮六百一十二点五斤的计划想通了，劲头足了，还对实现这个指标所采取的措施提出了修正意见。社委会根据这些意见，将原计划今冬明春新建水库六座改为九座，再增养生猪三百头，还准备争取使全社二千多亩小麦全部达到每亩产二百斤。
    为了实现明年粮食生产指标，这个社的九百多名男女社员全部出勤，掀起冬季生产高潮。现在，全社已有一百五十二亩地经过了深翻改良；劈岭填沟、平高垫洼的土地达三十五亩；在麦田浇水、追肥方面也获得了成绩。
