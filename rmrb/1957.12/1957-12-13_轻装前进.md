Lighten the Load and Advance
　　Xing Zi
　　I met Li Deyou during the Liberation War. One day, new recruits were added to the platoon, and among them was a sticky, not-so-talkative guy, and that was him.

　　In those years of frequent battles, nobody wanted to carry extra things, simply because they were heavy and cumbersome. Several times, on the eve of forced marches, the higher-ups called on everyone to "lighten the load and advance." They would take the cotton out of their quilts, throw away unneeded shirts (mostly to the villagers), leaving almost nothing except their guns, shoes, and the clothes on their backs.

　　But Li Deyou couldn't bear to throw anything away. Sometimes he even picked up things that others had discarded! Everyone else was cleaning their guns, but he was staring blankly at that pile of cotton batting in the corner of the kang.

　　"This stuff is worth money if you buy it!"

　　Of course, his backpack was especially large, and when marching, it was like a small mountain pressing on his shoulders. What everyone was most unhappy about was that he didn't seem to care at all; if anyone said anything to him, he would purse his lips and turn his head to the side. Obviously, he was planning to take these things home. This was nothing strange, since he hadn't been in the army long.

　　"Lighten the load and advance" also had another interpretation, which was to temporarily discard unnecessary items when preparing to charge. But even in that situation, Li Deyou would avoid throwing things away if he could, and after the battle, he would hurry back to find them, not really trusting the comrades designated to collect the backpacks. In this way, he inevitably lagged behind during the charge.

　　Before the battle of Linfen, we had another forced march. During this, some comrades really couldn't bear it anymore and launched an "offensive" against Li Deyou while walking.

　　"Li Deyou, don't you feel heavy?"

　　"Your backpack is a bit big, isn't it!"

　　"Ah, ah, I can carry it." Li Deyou didn't understand that they were mocking him. "I can carry it."

　　"Everyone is lightening the load and advancing, what about you, Li Deyou?" I felt it was better to be direct.

　　Who knew that this would anger him instead. He glanced at me and said, huffily:

　　"Don't worry! I won't hold you back! ... I didn't ask you to carry it for me! ... I'll advance even if I don't lighten the load!"

　　A shock troop was being organized. The whole company signed up. As a result, the company made a selection. Li Deyou went to the company commander and said, "Company commander! Whether you pick me or not, I have to go!" Sure enough, when the list of shock troop members was announced, he was on it.

　　Li Deyou handed all his things over to me: what a huge backpack, two teacups, a bundle, and so on.

　　"Take the cotton out of the quilt," he said to me, "and that bundle of clothes, give it all to the cultural instructor and have him give it all to the villagers."

　　"Lightening the load?" I said softly, turning my head to the side to hide my excitement.

　　"Lightening the load!" He was covered in hand grenades. He felt the hand grenade pins to make sure they were secure. "How can you advance without lightening the load!"

　　Before setting off, he said to the instructor: "Instructor… This is an armed struggle, for the liberation of the suffering people, for victory, I – lighten the load and advance!"

　　With a deafening roar, thousands of pounds of yellow explosives blew a gap in the city of Linfen. The shock troops let out a shout and charged forward, and then we followed.

　　From the time Li Deyou left me until the end of the battle, I don't know why, I was very silent. We had a meal in a large courtyard. But I couldn't swallow a single bite.

　　Suddenly, I heard a familiar voice behind me –

　　"Where's my spoon? Where's my spoon?"

　　Turning around, I saw Li Deyou, his clothes torn, his face covered in dirt! I was overjoyed! I saw stars, I almost cried, I roared and lunged at him, giving him a punch.

　　"You didn't die!"

　　"If I died, this show couldn't go on!"

　　Later, during the battle of Taiyuan, he was wounded and transferred to a local job. Later, he was transferred to Beijing. The two of us met again unexpectedly in a department store. At that time, he was holding a stainless steel steamer in one hand, and some kind of bundle in the other, and a woman was following behind him (after being introduced, I learned that she was his wife). Of course, after we recognized each other, we first laughed until we couldn't breathe, and then, as usual, we expressed our affection with our fists.

　　"Buying things, setting up a home!" He weighed the stainless steel steamer in his hand. "Look, this pot is so good! ... I'm planning to buy a three-tube radio, what do you think?"

　　After that, I often went to his house on holidays. I really envied him, he had a natural talent for living life, buying this today, buying that tomorrow, arranging his home in an orderly manner, with everything he needed.

　　I was approved to return to my hometown to engage in production. Yesterday, I went to his house to say goodbye. Pushing open the door, I was shocked. I saw that he was busy, spreading many things and utensils, this pile and that stack, on the bed and on the floor. He was covered in dust, with a streak of black on his mouth. His wife was pouting on the side, mumbling something. Seeing me, he stood up and said, laughing:

　　"I was just about to look for you!" He pointed to the utensils on the floor. "Come on, you have priority! Take whatever you like!..."

　　I didn't understand!

　　"I've been approved to go to the countryside to participate in production! I thought about it a lot these past few days. I didn't get it, I couldn't bear to leave this home. Later," he said softly, "I suddenly remembered the past, you forgot that I said—"

　　"How can you advance without lightening the load!"

　　"Right! What's important is lightening the ideological load!" He once again wanted me to pick things and take them away.

　　I said I didn't need them now, because –

　　"I'm going too!"

　　This time, he punched me.

　　"For the construction of socialism, for victory, we must also 'lighten the load and advance'!" (with picture)

　　轻装前进
　　兴子
    认识李德有还是解放战争时期。有一天，排里补充新战士，其中有个粘粘乎乎不大说话的，那就是他。
    在那个战斗频繁的年月里，谁身上也不愿带有多余的东西，无非是嫌沉、嫌累赘。有几次上级也在急行军的前夕，号召大家“轻装前进”。把棉被里的棉花掏出来，把用不着的衬衣扔下（多半是给老乡），除了枪、鞋和随身穿的衣服而外，几乎什么也不剩。
    但是李德有却什么也舍不得扔。有时候人家别人扔下的东西他还拣起来呢！大家在擦枪，他对着炕角上那堆棉花套发楞。
    “这东西，买起来可就值钱啦！”
    当然，他的背包特别大，行起军来，简直像个小山似的压在他肩上。大家最不满意的是，他对这一切竟毫不在意；谁若是说说他，他就把嘴一撇，歪在一边。显而易见他是准备把这些东西带回家去。这没有什么稀奇的，入伍不久嘛。
    “轻装前进”还有个解释，这就是在准备冲锋的时候，临时扔下不需要的东西。但是，就连那种情况，李德有也是能不扔就不扔，打完了仗又赶快回去找，不大信任指定的搜集背包的同志。这样，在冲锋的时候，他就难免跑在后面。
    打临汾之前，我们又来了个急行军。这当中，有的同志实在忍无可忍，就在走路中间，向李德有展开了“攻势”。
    “李德有，你不觉沉吗？”
    “你的背包大点吧！”
    “啊啊，我背的动。”李德有没有弄明白人家在讽刺他。“我背的动。”
    “都轻装前进，你呢，李德有？”我觉得不如直说好些。
    谁知这反倒惹恼了他。他看了我一眼，气哼哼地说：
    “放心！拉不下我！……我也没让你替我背！……我不轻装也前进！”
    要组织突击队了。全连都报了名。这样，连里挑选了一下。李德有找连长说：“连长！挑不挑我也得去！”果然，公布突击队员名单时，就有他。
    李德有把所有的东西交给了我：什么硕大无比的背包啦、两个茶缸啦、一个包袱啦等等。
    “把棉被里的棉花拆出来”，他向我说，“还有那包衣服，都交给文化教员，让他都给老乡。”
    “轻装啦？”我轻轻说，把头扭在一边，掩饰自己的激动。
    “轻装啦！”他混身挂满了手榴弹。他摸摸手榴弹栓得牢靠不。“不轻装怎么前进呢！”
    在临出发之前，他跟指导员说：“指导员……这会儿是武装斗争，为解放受苦受难的人民，为胜利，我——轻装前进！”
    一声巨响，几千斤黄色炸药把临汾城炸开一个缺口，突击队呐喊一声，冲了上去，紧接着，我们也跟了上去。
    从李德有离开我，到战斗结束，不知为什么，我一直很沉默。在一个大院里，我们开饭了。可是我一口也咽不下去。
    忽然，我听到背后一个熟悉的声音——
    “我的勺呢？我的勺呢？”
    回头，我看见衣服撕得稀乱、满脸是土的李德有！我高兴坏了！眼前直冒星，直要流泪，大吼一声，扑上去给了他一拳头。
    “你没死呀！”
    “死了这台戏就没法唱啦！”
    后来打太原时，他挂了花，转业到了地方。再以后他调到北京。我俩是在百货公司不期而然又遇到的。那时，他一手抱了个钢种蒸锅，一手还拿个什么包袱，后面还跟着个女人（经介绍，我才知道那是他老婆）。当然，我们彼此认出来后，先是笑得透不过气来，以后，照老规矩，我们俩用拳头表示了一番亲热。
    “买东西，置家务！”他掂了掂手中的钢种蒸锅，“你看，这锅有多好！……我准备买个三个泡的收音机，你看怎样？”
    以后，我常常在假日时到他家里去。我真羡慕他，他有一套天生的过日子的本领，今天买这，明天买那，把个家布置得井井有条，应有尽有。
    我被批准回乡生产了，昨天我去他家辞行，推开门，我大吃一惊。我看到他正忙活，把许多东西、器具，这一堆那一罗的摊在床上、地上。他满身尘土，嘴巴子上还抹了道黑。他老婆在一边噘着嘴，正咕念什么。看见我，他站起身来，嘻嘻哈哈说：
    “我正要找你！”他指着地上的器具，“来，你有优先权！你喜欢什么就拿什么！……”
    我不明白！
    “已经批准我下乡参加生产了！我前些日子想了好多。我不通，我舍不得这个家。后来，”他小声说，“我忽然想到以前了，你忘了我说过——”
    “不轻装怎么前进呢！”
    “对！要紧的是思想上的轻装！”他再一次要我挑东西拿走。
    我说我现在不需要，因为——
    “我也走！”
    这一次，他打了我一拳头。
    “为了建设社会主义，为了胜利，我们还要‘轻装前进’！”（附图片）
