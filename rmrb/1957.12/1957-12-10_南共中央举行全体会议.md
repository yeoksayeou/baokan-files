    Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, December 9th: According to the Yugoslav News Agency, the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia held its ninth plenary session on December 7th in Brioni.
    The communique issued after the meeting stated that the plenary session approved the work and report of the LCY Central Committee delegation's participation in the Moscow celebration of the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. The plenary session considered that the LCY delegation's decision not to participate in the meeting of representatives of communist and workers' parties of socialist countries and not to sign the declaration of this meeting was "the right thing to do" because it believed that "some attitudes and estimates in the declaration were contrary to the attitudes of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia."
    The communique also stated that the plenary session believes that differences of opinion between the LCY and the communist parties of other countries on certain issues are unnecessary and should not become an obstacle to the development of fraternal cooperation in the struggle for socialism and peace throughout the world.

    南共中央举行全体会议
    新华社贝尔格莱德9日电　据南斯拉夫通讯社消息，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟中央委员会12月7日在布里俄尼举行了第九次全体会议。
    会后发表的公报说，全体会议批准了南共中央代表团参加莫斯科庆祝十月革命四十周年的工作和报告。全体会议认为，南共代表团不参加社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议以及不在这个会议的宣言上签字是“做得对的”，因为它认为宣言中“有些态度和估计是和南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的态度相违背的”。
    公报又说，全体会议认为，南共同其他国家共产党之间在某些问题上的意见分歧，不必要而且不应当成为在争取全世界社会主义和和平的斗争中发展兄弟合作的障碍。
