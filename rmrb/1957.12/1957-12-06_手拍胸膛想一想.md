Think it Over with a Hand on Your Chest
　　Zhang Changgong

　　At the debate, a wealthy middle peasant said that there wasn't enough food and wanted to withdraw his carts and horses from the commune. At this time, an old farmer with white hair and beard stood up in the corner, pointing at him and saying: "Brother, you're forgetting your roots... An old tree has many roots and an old man has many words, don't嫌嫌老汉说话啰嗦 [Don't mind the old man's nagging]. You are rich and imposing, with both mules and horses and sheep. Joining the commune seems like a loss to you, but the poor have benefited from your light! Think it over with a hand on your chest, is your heart fed to the wolves! This old man has a ledger in his heart, and it's a long story to tell. Your father and mother came to escape the famine, with a carrying pole and two baskets. You were as thin as a monkey then, three tendons holding up a head. The landlord pressed for rent and debts, forcing you to take your children and flee outside the pass. Poor people all over the world are of one heart, and our village took in your family. After a spring rain, the land is renewed, and the relatives, the Eighth Route Army, arrived. We struggled against the landlord and divided the land, and your father became the director of the farmers' association. He was injured fighting bandits, and as he breathed his last, he confided in me. "I am not long-lived and have no fortune, but my children have caught up with socialism." Who would have thought that now you have money and you are hedging your bets about joining the commune. You have a cotton brain and a tofu heart, blindly following the rich peasants. If they say it's a lamp, you add oil, if they say it's a temple, you kowtow. The agricultural cooperative is good in every way, where are you running to with the rich peasants? You eat grain outside your belly, exchanging it for wine and meat and reselling it. You want to hoard grain to become a grain merchant, stuffing yourself to death and starving others! A man's greed is like a snake trying to swallow an elephant, forgetting the pain once the wound is healed. One seedling in a thousand mu of land, the cooperative is our precious treasure. You must listen clearly to what the Party says, and keep it in your heart like a light in your palm. Open your eyes and look carefully, wake up and return to being a member of the commune…"

　　手拍胸膛想一想
　　张长弓
    在大辩论的会场上，一个富裕中农说粮食不够吃，要抽出车马退社。这时角落里站起一个须发皆白的老农，手指着他说：“老弟呀，你忘本啦……树老根多人老话多，莫嫌老汉说话啰嗦。你钱大气粗腰杆壮，又有骡马又有羊。入社好像吃了亏，穷人沾了你的光！手拍胸膛想一想，难道人心喂了狼！老汉心里有本账，提起来话儿长。你爹你娘来逃荒，一根扁担两只筐。你那时饿的像瘦猴，三根筋挑着一个头。地主逼租又逼债，担起儿女跑关外。天下穷人心连心，收留你家在咱村。一场春雨满地新，来了亲人八路军。斗争地主把土地分，你爹当上农会主任。为打土匪挂了花，咽气时跟我说下知心话。“我不长命没福气，孩子们赶上了社会主义。”哪想你这阵有了钱，入社脚踩两只船。棉花脑瓜豆腐心，跟着富农瞎胡混。他说是灯你就添油，他说是庙你就磕头。农业社里千般好，你跟富农往哪里跑？你粮食吃在肚皮外，又换酒肉又捣卖。想囤下粮食当粮商，撑死你一家饿死一方！人心不足蛇吞象，好了疮疤忘了伤。千亩地里一棵苗，合作社是咱宝中宝。党的话你要听清，心里就像掌上灯。你擦亮眼睛仔细看，觉悟回头当社员……
