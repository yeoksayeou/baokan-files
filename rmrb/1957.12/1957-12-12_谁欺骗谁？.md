　　Who is Deceiving Whom?
　　Zeng Tianjia
　　Posted a big-character poster, responding to the Party's call:
　　Requesting to go to the countryside, for training and transformation.
　　The organization just approved it, but she got a scare:
　　Pretending became reality, this is terrible!
　　Others aren't going down, why must I?
　　Isn't this bias, or just messing around,
　　It's simply deception, I'm going to sue!
　　This is a doggerel I wrote after hearing about the situation of a transferred cadre in a Beijing suburban village. This comrade posted a big-character poster requesting the organization to approve her going to the countryside for labor, but when the organization approved her request, she was full of displeasure. Although she had gone to the countryside, her thinking hadn't been resolved. She said, there are many people applying to go to the countryside, why only approve us? It seems that the leaders are biased, and those who like to give the leaders opinions are approved to go to the countryside. We have been deceived, the leaders have deceived us...
　　Let me add that this comrade is still a Communist Party member!
　　Cadre transfer to participate in labor is the Party's policy. This Communist Party member seems to have no understanding of the significance of the transfer. She is unwilling to go down in her heart, but she is afraid of being labeled as "backward". So she deceives herself and deceives the Party. What she is worried about day and night is: please don't approve me! However, things are not so satisfactory. The Party believes that what she said is the truth. In order to cultivate and train cadres, and in order not to disappoint her "sincerity", her request was approved. But she has given the Party the crime of "deception"! Who exactly is deceiving whom?
　　Of course, this is just a very individual case. Even in this village, I heard many transferred cadres talk about their experiences of going to the countryside for labor. Their experiences are very different from this female comrade's. They thank the Party for approving their transfer requests, and thank the Party for giving them a good opportunity for training. One comrade, after learning about the female comrade's bad performance, said angrily: "How can you say that the Party is biased and that the Party is deceiving her? The Party is cultivating us! If someone like her stays in the office, after many cadres are transferred, she will probably complain that the work in the office is too heavy!"
　　These are two different understandings of cadre transfer. With the correct understanding, one can get real training and transformation after going down, and one can closely connect with the masses. Otherwise, not only can one not train and transform oneself, but one will also cause a lot of trouble to others. People with the correct understanding are, after all, the majority. In this village, the vast majority of transferred cadres can endure hardship, actively produce, overcome difficulties, and some also help the township and cooperative do some political and ideological work, and help the villagers do some housework, and are welcomed by the township, cooperative cadres and the masses. There are many moving examples: a transferred cadre worked in a production team, and performed well in production and in relations with the masses. Later, the cooperative planned to transfer him to another production team, but this production team refused to let him go. They said angrily: "If you must transfer him, don't send any more transferred cadres to our team in the future." Another example is: two female comrades lived in a villager's home, and had a particularly good relationship with the villager. Later, they had to move to another place to live, and the people in the same courtyard were reluctant to part, and some even shed tears. ...
　　I think these examples will have some educational significance for the Communist Party member mentioned earlier. If she still has a bit of Communist Party flavor, she will see with shame: it is not the Party "deceiving" her, but she is deceiving the Party; it is not the Party "messing around", but the bourgeois individualism in her mind is causing trouble. This cannot be solved by "suing". To solve it, one must change one's position and be determined to train and transform oneself in labor.

### 谁欺骗谁？

　　谁欺骗谁？
　　曾田家
　　贴了大字报，响应党号召：
　　要求下乡去，锻炼和改造。
　　组织刚批准，她却吓一跳：
　　弄假成了真，这事多糟糕！
　　别人不下去，为何我就要？
　　不是有偏心，就是在胡闹，
　　简直是欺骗，我要把状告！
    这是我在北京郊区一个乡里听到一个下放干部的情况后写的一首打油诗。这个同志贴了大字报要求组织批准她下乡劳动，但当组织批准了她的要求的时候，她却满肚子不高兴。人虽然下到乡里了，思想可没解决问题。她说，申请下乡的人很多，为什么就单批准我们这些人？看来领导上有偏心，爱给领导提意见的人都被批准下乡了。我们受了骗，领导上欺骗了我们。……
    附带说明一下，这个同志还是个共产党员哩！
    干部下放参加劳动是党的政策，这个共产党员对下放的意义似乎毫不理解，心里是一千个不愿下去，但又怕背“落后”之名，于是她就欺骗自己，欺骗党。她日夜担心的是：该不要批准我呀！然而事情又不那么如意，党相信她说的是真话，为了培养和锻炼干部，为了不辜负她的一片“诚心”，批准了她的要求。而她却给党加上了“欺骗”的罪名！这到底是谁在欺骗谁呢？
    当然这只是极个别的事例。就是在这个乡里，我听到许多下放干部谈他们下乡劳动的体会，他们的体会和这个女同志的大不相同。他们感谢党批准他们下放的要求，感谢党给了他们一个很好的锻炼的机会。一个同志在得知这个女同志的不良表现之后，愤愤地说：“这怎么能说党有偏心，说党在欺骗她呢？党是在培养我们呀！像她这样的人，留在机关里，在许多干部下放之后，恐怕她又要嫌机关的工作太重了哩！”
    这是对干部下放的两种不同的认识。有了正确的认识，下去以后才能得到真正的锻炼和改造，才能密切地联系群众，否则不但不能锻炼和改造自己，反而会给别人增加许多麻烦。有正确认识的人毕竟是大多数。在这个乡里的下放干部，绝大多数都能吃苦耐劳，积极生产，克服困难，有的还帮助乡、社做一些政治思想工作，帮助老乡做一些家务劳动，受到乡、社干部和群众的欢迎。动人的事例是不少的：一个下放干部在一个生产队里劳动，在生产上和与群众的关系上表现都不错，后来社里打算把他调到另外一个生产队去，这个生产队不肯放，他们生气地说：“如果你们一定要调，以后就不要再派下放干部到我们队里来了。”另外一个例子是：有两个女同志住在老乡家里，和老乡的关系特别好，以后她们要搬到另外一个地方住，同院子的人都依依不舍，有的还流下了眼泪。……
    我想，这些例子对前面提到的那个共产党员多少会有一些教育意义。假如她还有一点共产党员气味的话，她会自惭地看到：不是党在“欺骗”她，而是她在欺骗党；不是党在“胡闹”，而是她脑子里的资产阶级个人主义思想在作怪。这不是“告状”能解决得了的，要解决就得改变立场，下定决心在劳动中锻炼和改造自己。
