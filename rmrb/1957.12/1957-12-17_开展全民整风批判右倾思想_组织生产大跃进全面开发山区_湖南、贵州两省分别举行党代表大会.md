Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, December 15th: The Second Session of the First Congress of the Communist Party of China, Hunan Province, which opened on November 26th, concluded on December 12th.

　　The meeting decided to mobilize all party members and people in the province to forge ahead, continuously organize several great leaps forward in agricultural production, so that by 1967, the province's total grain output will reach 45.4 billion jin, and the average income of the agricultural population will reach 150 to 160 yuan per person, doubling the current level. The meeting believes that completing this task is within reach, but it is necessary to seize the work during the Second Five-Year Plan period, especially to do a good job in next year's production. Next year, the total grain output is required to reach 24.5 billion jin to 25 billion jin, and 30 counties and cities in the province should have an average yield of 600, 700, 800, 900 to 1,000 jin per mu respectively, as a preparation for organizing a greater leap forward in the Second Five-Year Plan, so as to enable all agricultural cooperatives in the province to catch up with and surpass the production level of local well-to-do middle peasants within three to five years.

　　This meeting was conducted using the methods of great airing of views, great blooming, and great debates, fully promoting democracy, and comprehensively examining and summarizing the agricultural production and overall work of the province in the past five years. During the meeting, the representatives posted a total of 4,752 big-character posters, raising a total of 5,779 criticisms and suggestions. The provincial party committee secretary and heads of various departments personally attended, read each item, and studied how to deal with them. According to statistics, the responsible comrades of the provincial party committee and various departments of the provincial party committee posted a total of 346 big-character posters during the meeting, responding to some of the opinions raised and making immediate improvements in some cases. After full debate, the representatives distinguished right from wrong, and their revolutionary enthusiasm soared to an unprecedented level. Everyone expressed their determination to resolutely complete the targets stipulated in the Hunan Provincial Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) and strive to exceed them.

　　In the discussion, the representatives all agreed that the development of agricultural production in Hunan Province in the past five years has been relatively rapid. During this period, although it suffered from two floods and droughts unprecedented in a century, the grain output still increased from 20.6 billion jin to 23 billion jin, and the number of live pigs increased from 6.83 million to more than 9 million by the end of September this year, and the total agricultural output value increased by 12.5%. However, compared with Hunan's subjective and objective conditions, the speed of development is still not fast enough. This is mainly due to many shortcomings in the work, especially since the winter and spring of this year, the right-leaning conservative thought within the party has grown to some extent, the struggle between the two roads has not been emphasized enough, and the support for new things and the promotion of advanced experience have not been enough, resulting in a slackening phenomenon in the leadership of agricultural production. The meeting analyzed the new situation after the rural collectivization and believed that the struggle between the two roads in the countryside would still require a considerable period of time to resolve. This year, the income from household sideline occupations of some agricultural cooperative members accounted for about half of their total income. They were only willing to engage in their own private production and were unwilling to participate in the collective labor of the cooperative. The discipline of the agricultural cooperative was lax, and the enthusiasm for expanding reproduction was not great. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to widely and deeply carry out the mass rectification movement in the countryside, criticize the capitalist thinking of some well-to-do middle peasants, crack down on the sabotage activities of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, and strengthen the confidence and determination of the broad masses of peasants to take the socialist road, and thoroughly defeat capitalism politically and ideologically.

　　Based on the frequent occurrence of serious water and drought disasters in Hunan, the meeting believed that to ensure the rapid growth of grain production, it is necessary to vigorously build water conservancy projects with the spirit of moving mountains and filling the sea, and basically eliminate water and drought disasters within three to five years. In areas where conditions are suitable for mechanical irrigation and drainage, mechanical irrigation and drainage should be actively developed to solve the problem of waterlogging in the Dongting Lake area, the main grain-producing area, and the irrigation problem of farmland along rivers and lakes as soon as possible. Efforts should be made to use mechanical irrigation and drainage in all areas within two or three years, freeing up labor to focus on intensive farming, and completely change the extensive farming and low yield situation in these areas.

　　Mountainous areas account for more than two-thirds of the total area of Hunan Province, with abundant resources and great potential for increasing production, but there is a shortage of labor and inconvenient transportation. The meeting requested that party committees at all levels should strengthen the specific leadership of production work in mountainous areas in the future, and relevant departments should also strive to support from the aspects of industry, transportation, supply and marketing trade, culture, education, and health, and actively lead and help the people in mountainous areas develop mountain production.

　　Special dispatch from Xinhua News Agency to this newspaper: The Second Session of the First Congress of the Communist Party of China, Guizhou Province, was held from December 3rd to 5th. This meeting was held after a twenty-day provincial four-level cadre meeting.

　　The meeting discussed and adopted the "Guizhou Provincial Agricultural Plan Outline (Draft) for 1956 to 1967" proposed by the provincial party committee. This plan outline puts forward the following goals to the people of all ethnic groups in the province within twelve years: the average grain yield per mu in the province will be increased from 340 jin to 800 jin; the forest area of the province will be increased from 10% of the land area to 35%; the number of cattle and horses will be increased from 3.25 million to more than 6.6 million; the number of pigs will be increased from 4.4 million to 17 million; the production of various agricultural and sideline products, local specialties, and minerals will also be rapidly developed; the construction of road networks will be basically completed in all counties, districts, townships, and cooperatives; the comprehensive management of all river basins and waterways will be basically completed; and in the next five years, agricultural production cooperatives will catch up with or surpass the production and income levels of local well-to-do middle peasants when they were working individually, and strive to achieve this within three years.

　　The meeting believed that Guizhou Province is a mountainous area. According to the spirit of Article 17 of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) proposed by the Central Government on developing the mountain economy, it is necessary to determine the basic principle of comprehensively developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, local specialties, and minerals in a planned and appropriate manner based on doing a good job in soil and water conservation and striving for self-sufficiency in grain and oil crops. It would be wrong to neglect any of these aspects.

　　The meeting believed that in order to realize the Agricultural Plan Outline (Revised Draft), the entire party must be energetic, unite and lead millions of people, and use their own creative labor to change the backwardness of the mountainous areas. Therefore, it is necessary to implement the principle of building the country diligently and thriftily with more, faster, better, and more economical results, as instructed by the Party Central Committee, implement the principle of "overall planning, strengthening leadership," and "the secretary takes the lead, the whole party runs the cooperatives," actively respond to the Central Committee's great call to "face the mountainous areas, march into the mountainous areas, go to the countryside and up the mountains," vigorously streamline administrative institutions, reduce the upper levels, transfer cadres to lower levels, and strengthen the leadership of grassroots work. Leaders at all levels in rural areas must actively study agricultural production technology, and leaders at the county, district, and township levels must establish agricultural technology experimental sites and gradually become experts in leading agricultural production. It is necessary to give full play to the superiority of the cooperative system with the perseverance of the Foolish Old Man Who Moved the Mountains, vigorously build farmland water conservancy, and implement the principle of self-repair, self-management, and self-support by the cooperatives; vigorously carry out soil and water conservation work; green all barren mountains that can be greened; use abundant grass and water resources to vigorously develop animal husbandry; actively carry out basic farmland construction, gradually improve the soil, turn poor land into fertile land, change dry land into paddy fields, change sloping land into terraced fields, and change single cropping into multiple cropping; vigorously carry out the work of eliminating illiteracy; mobilize and organize middle and primary school graduates who cannot go on to higher education to go to the countryside and up the mountains; carry out the movement to eliminate the four pests and strive to eliminate the most serious diseases that endanger people's health. Developing mountain production is a long-term central task of the entire party. Industrial, commercial, transportation, financial, cultural, educational, and health departments must all make specific plans for building the mountains and work together to promote the development of mountain production. Agricultural production cooperatives are the organizational guarantee for developing mountain production, and it is necessary to implement the principles of "running cooperatives diligently and thriftily" and "running cooperatives democratically," and it is necessary to take into account the interests of the state, cooperatives, and members, increase public accumulation year by year, expand basic construction, and consolidate the cooperatives day by day.

　　The meeting believed that the task of developing mountain production and transforming the backward appearance of mountain areas is arduous and glorious. In the process of completing this task, it is necessary to fight against right-leaning conservative thinking and unrealistic practices, and it is currently necessary to deeply criticize right-leaning conservative thinking. At the same time, the entire party must constantly conduct socialist education among the people, carry out the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads, do a good job in rectifying the party, the league, and the cooperatives, and be vigilant against all enemies' sabotage at all times.

　　In addition, during the meeting, Comrade Miao Chunting delivered a report on behalf of the provincial party committee, "Striving for a Complete Victory in the Rectification Movement in Our Province." After discussion, the meeting unanimously approved this report. The meeting believed that although Guizhou Province's rectification movement has achieved great victory, it is only a preliminary victory, and it is necessary to work harder in the future to strive for a complete victory in the mass rectification movement.

　　A total of 354 representatives attended this meeting, of whom 106 made speeches and written statements during the meeting. At the end of the meeting, two additional members of the provincial party committee were elected.

　　开展全民整风批判右倾思想  组织生产大跃进全面开发山区
    湖南、贵州两省分别举行党代表大会
    新华社长沙15日电　11月26日开幕的中共湖南省第一届代表大会第二次会议，已于12月12日闭幕。
      会议决定动员全省党员和全省人民，奋发前进，连续组织几个农业生产大跃进，使全省在1967年粮食总产量达到四百五十四亿斤，农业人口每人平均收入达到一百五十到一百六十元，比现在增加一倍。会议认为完成这个任务是有把握的，但是，必须抓紧第二个五年计划期间的工作，尤其要把明年的生产搞好。明年要求粮食总产量达到二百四十五亿斤到二百五十亿斤，全省要有三十个县、市的每亩平均产量分别达到六百、七百、八百、九百至一千斤，作为实现第二个五年计划组织更大跃进的准备，以便在三、五年内使全省所有农业社赶上和超过当地富裕中农的生产水平。
    这次会议是运用大鸣、大放、大争的方法进行的，充分发扬民主，全面检查和总结了五年来的农业生产和全省工作。在会议期间，到会代表先后贴出了四千七百五十二张大字报，共提出批评和建议五千七百七十九条，省委书记和各部门负责人都亲自到场逐条阅读并研究处理办法。据统计，省委各负责同志和省委各部门在会议期间共出了三百四十六张大字报，对提出的部分意见分别作了答复，有的还立刻进行了改进。经过充分辩论，到会代表分清了是非，革命干劲空前高涨，大家表示坚决完成湖南省农业发展纲要（修正草案）规定的指标，并努力争取超过。
    在讨论中，代表们都认为，这五年来湖南省农业生产的发展是比较快的。在这期间，虽然遭受了两次百年来未有的洪水和大旱，粮食产量仍由二百零六亿斤增加到二百三十亿斤，生猪由六百八十三万头发展到今年9月底的九百多万头，农业总产值增长了12.5％。但是发展的速度和湖南的主客观条件比较起来，还是不够快，这主要是工作上存在着许多缺点，特别是去冬今春以来，党内的右倾保守思想一度有了滋长，对两条道路的斗争强调不够，对新鲜事物的支持和对先进经验的推广都不够，因而在农业生产的领导上产生了松劲现象。会议分析了农村合作化后的新形势，认为农村两条道路的斗争还需要一个相当长的时期才能解决。今年，有些农业社的社员家庭副业收入占总收入的一半左右，他们只愿自己私人生产，不愿参加社的集体劳动，农业社纪律松懈，扩大再生产的劲头不大。因此，要在农村中继续广泛深入地开展全民整风运动，批判部分富裕中农的资本主义思想，打击地主、富农、反革命分子和坏分子的破坏活动，坚定广大农民走社会主义道路的信心和决心，在政治上、思想上彻底战胜资本主义。
    根据湖南常常发生严重水旱灾的情况，会议认为要保证粮食生产以较快速度增长，首先就要以移山填海的劲头，大力兴修水利，在三、五年内基本上消灭水旱灾害。凡条件适合机械排灌的地方，应积极发展机械排灌，提早解决主要粮产区洞庭湖区的排渍问题和江河沿岸农田的灌溉问题，争取在二、三年内全部使用机械排灌，腾出劳动力在精耕细作上下功夫，彻底改变这些地区广种薄收的局面。
    湖南山区占全省面积三分之二以上，资源丰富，增产潜力很大，但劳力不足，交通不便。会议要求各级党委今后要加强山区生产工作的具体领导，各有关部门也应从工业、交通运输、供销贸易、文教卫生等方面努力支援，积极领导和帮助山区人民发展山区生产。
    本报特约新华社稿　中共贵州省第一届代表大会第二次会议，于12月3日至5日举行。这次会议是在历时二十天的全省党内四级干部会议结束后召开的。
    会议讨论并通过了省委提出的“1956年到1967年贵州省农业计划纲要（草案）”。这个计划纲要，向全省各族人民提出了十二年内的奋斗目标：全省粮食每亩平均产量由三百四十斤提高到八百斤；全省的森林面积由占土地面积的10％提高到35％；牛马的头数由三百二十五万头增加到六百六十多万头；猪的头数由四百四十万头增加到一千七百万头；各种农副业及土特产和矿业的生产也都要有迅速的发展；使所有的县、区、乡、社基本上完成道路网的建设；使所有的流域和河道基本上得到综合治理；在最近五年内要使农业生产合作社都赶上或超过当地富裕中农在单干时的生产水平和收入水平，并力争在三年内达到。
    会议认为，贵州省是个山区，根据中央提出的全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）第十七条发展山区经济的精神，确定要在做好水土保持、力争粮食和油料等自给有余的基础上，有计划地因地制宜地全面发展农业、林业、牧业和土特产、矿产等多种经济的基本方针。忽视其中任何一个方面都是错误的。
    会议认为，为了实现农业计划纲要（修正草案），全党必须振作起来，团结和带领千百万群众，用自己的创造性的劳动，改变山区的落后面貌。因此，必须贯彻执行党中央指示的又多、又快、又好、又省的勤俭建国的方针，贯彻执行“全面规划，加强领导”、“书记动手，全党办社”的方针，积极响应中央“面向山区，向山区进军，下乡上山”的伟大号召，大力紧缩行政机构，精减上层，下放干部，加强基层工作的领导。农村各级领导必须积极地钻研农业生产技术，县、区、乡各级领导都要建立农业技术试验地，逐渐变成领导农业生产的内行。要以愚公移山的毅力，充分发挥合作制度的优越性，大力兴修农田水利，贯彻合作社自修自管自养的方针；大力作好水土保持工作；绿化一切可以绿化的荒山；利用丰富的草源和水源，大力发展畜牧业；积极进行农田基本建设，逐步改良土壤，变瘦田为肥田，改旱田为水田，改坡地为梯田，改单季为多季；大力进行扫除文盲工作；动员组织不能升学的中小学毕业生下乡上山；开展除四害运动，为消灭危害人民健康的最严重的疾病而斗争。发展山区生产是全党的长期的中心任务，工业、商业、交通、财经、文教、卫生等部门，都必须作出建设山区的具体规划，共同为促进山区生产发展而努力。农业生产合作社是发展山区生产的组织保证，必须贯彻执行“勤俭办社”、“民主办社”的方针，必须统筹兼顾国家、合作社、社员三者之间的利益，逐年增加公共积累，扩大基本建设，使合作社日益巩固。
    会议认为，发展山区生产，改造山区落后面貌的任务是艰巨而光荣的。在完成这项任务的过程中，必须和右倾保守思想及脱离实际的作法作斗争，而当前必须深入批判右倾保守思想。同时，全党必须经常对人民进行社会主义教育，开展社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，作好整党、整团和整社工作，并时刻警惕一切敌人的破坏。
    此外，会议期间苗春亭同志代表省委作了“为争取我省整风运动的全胜而斗争”的报告。经过讨论，会议一致通过了这个报告。会议认为，贵州省的整风运动虽已取得巨大胜利，但只是初步的胜利，今后必须更加努力，为争取全民整风运动的全胜而斗争。
    出席这次会议的代表共三百五十四人，其中有一百零六人在会议过程中作了大会发言和书面发言。会议最后增选了两名省委委员。
