    The Ministry of Urban Construction Determines Central Tasks for 1958
    Continue to Improve Quality, Comprehensively Reduce Costs

    (Our Dispatch) In order to persistently implement the Party Central Committee's policy of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, the Ministry of Urban Construction has proposed that the central tasks for 1958 are to continue to improve engineering quality, comprehensively reduce engineering costs, and give full play to investment effectiveness.

    In the past, the Ministry of Urban Construction made great efforts to reduce the cost of civil buildings, such as reducing wall thickness, reducing indoor headroom, cutting down on dispensable equipment, and reducing auxiliary areas, which had significant economic effects. The cost in 1957 was reduced by 30% compared to 1953. According to an analysis by the person in charge of the General Office of the Ministry of Urban Construction, based on past experience, it is possible to increase the investment effect by 20% on the premise of improving quality; that is, to spend eighty yuan to do one hundred yuan's worth of work. The methods are: First, fully utilize local materials and reduce the use of mixed structures. Second, rationally solve the layout, expand the number of households, build fewer large units and suites, and reduce spare space, auxiliary area, and structural area as much as possible to increase capacity. Third, appropriately lower hygiene, fire prevention, and earthquake resistance standards, and overly high material quotas. Fourth, change a series of systems, save management costs, and eliminate material waste. Fifth, appropriately increase building density, save land purchase costs, and lower the standards of welfare facilities.

    Currently, the Ministry of Urban Construction is holding a local construction technology conference, focusing on studying the experiences created by the local construction industry in recent years in reducing construction costs and ensuring project quality, further summarizing and promoting them, so as to adopt these experiences in the Second Five-Year Plan, solving the people's needs for housing and cultural welfare life more, faster, better, and more economically, and implementing the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily ideologically and technically.

    During the First Five-Year Plan, the construction of urban public utilities generally kept up with the speed of industrial production; some places also gained some experience in using substitutes and reducing costs. For example, the Taiyuan Lancun Water Source Project Office used cement pipes instead of cast iron pipes, saving the country 15,000 tons of cast iron. The relevant person in charge of this ministry believes that the construction of public utilities currently needs to pay attention to two issues: one is to strengthen collaboration and close cooperation in all aspects to keep up with the needs of urban construction; the other is that each engineering unit must have a revolutionary spirit of creation to overcome the difficulty of raw materials. If these two issues are resolved well, it will be possible to make construction more, faster, better, and more economical.

    城市建设部确定1958年中心任务
    继续提高质量　全面降低造价
    本报讯　城市建设部为了坚持执行党中央的多快好省的建设方针，提出1958年的中心任务是：继续提高工程质量，全面降低工程造价，充分发挥投资效果。
    过去，城市建设部对降低民用建筑的造价曾经做了很大的努力，例如降低墙壁厚度，降低室内净空高度，削减可有可无的设备，减少辅助面积等等，经济效果很大。1957年的造价比1953年降低30％。据城市建设部办公厅负责人分析：根据过去的经验，在提高质量的前提下，把投资效果提高20％，即是说，花八十块钱办一百元的事，是可能的。办法是：第一、充分利用地方材料，少用混合结构。第二、合理解决平面布置，扩大居住户数，少建筑大单元、大套间的房子，尽可能减少备用空间，辅助面积、结构面积、增加容量。第三、适当降低卫生、防火、防震标准和偏高的材料定额。第四、改变一系列的制度，节省管理费用，杜绝材料浪费。第五、适当提高建筑密度，节省土地购置费用，降低福利设施标准。
    目前，城市建设部正在举行地方建筑技术会议，着重研究几年来地方建筑业所创造的降低建筑造价、保证工程质量的经验，进一步加以总结和推广，以便在第二个五年计划中采用这些经验，又多又快又好又省地为人民解决居住和文化福利生活的需要，从思想上技术上贯彻勤俭建国的方针。
    第一个五年计划期间城市公用事业的建设，大体上赶上了工业生产的速度；有些地方在利用代用品、降低造价方面，也取得一些经验。例如太原兰村水源工程处采用水泥管代替铸铁管，为国家节省了铸铁一万五千吨。这个部的有关负责人认为当前公用事业建设需要注意两个问题：一是加强协作，加强各方面密切配合，赶上城市建设的需要；二是各工程单位要有革命的创造精神，克服原材料困难。如果这两个问题解决得很好，就有可能使建设更加多些、快些、好些、省些。
