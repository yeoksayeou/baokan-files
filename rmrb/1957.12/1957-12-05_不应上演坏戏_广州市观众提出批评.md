Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 4th. The Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City Cultural Bureaus, and the Provincial and City Dramatists Associations, have been criticized severely by Guangzhou Cantonese opera enthusiasts for failing to promptly address the large number of bad plays appearing on the Cantonese opera stage recently, which has led to confusion in the repertoire.

In the past two or three months, many playwrights and actors in the Guangdong Cantonese opera circle have disregarded their promises to "not perform bad plays," which they made when they jointly responded to the call of National People's Congress representative Mei Lanfang and others in the drama community. Ignoring the impact on the audience, they have been competing to write and perform plays that are unhealthy or even contain toxins. According to newspaper advertisements, most of the 168 plays staged in Guangzhou's eleven theaters in the past two months are full of horror and erotic content. Such as "The Mad Monk of the Azure Sea," "Putting on the Old Kasaya Again," "A Walking Corpse's Revenge," "Iron-Mouthed Chicken's Journey to the Underworld," "Lightning Strikes a Kind-Hearted Person," "Mad Monk Marries a Corpse Beauty," "Morning Wife, Evening Sister-in-Law," etc. Scenes of corpses, tombs, and beheadings, as well as erotic depictions, have appeared on stage. Some playwrights, in order to obtain performance tax, have resorted to despicable means of stealing and deceiving, changing other people's scripts into so-called "new plays" to attract audiences. After obtaining a large amount of performance tax, they lead corrupt and decadent lives.

The Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City Cultural Bureaus, as well as the Provincial and City Dramatists Associations, were aware of these situations, but they tolerated them without taking any action. It was not until recently, when relevant leading organs and the general public raised criticisms, that the cultural departments began to pay attention and decided to take measures to deal with them.

### 不应上演坏戏　广州市观众提出批评

    不应上演坏戏
　　广州市观众提出批评
    新华社广州4日电　广东省、广州市文化局和省、市剧协，对最近时期粤剧舞台上出现的大量坏戏因而造成剧目混乱的情况，没有及时处理，受到广州市粤剧爱好者的严厉批评。
    近两、三个月来，广东省粤剧界不少剧作者和演员把曾经联名响应全国人民代表大会代表梅兰芳等号召戏剧界“不演坏戏”的诺言置之脑后，不顾对观众的影响，竞相编演一些不健康的甚至含有毒素的剧目。据报纸广告刊载，最近两个月广州十一个剧场上演的一百六十八个剧目，大部分充满着恐怖、色情的内容。如“碧海狂僧”、“重着旧袈裟”、“行尸复仇记”、“铁嘴鸡游鬼殿”、“雷劈好心人”、“狂僧娶艳尸”、“晨妻暮嫂”等，舞台上出现死尸、坟墓、斩杀等场景和色情描写。一部分编剧人员为了取得上演税，不惜采取卑鄙的偷窃和欺骗手段，将别人的剧本改换成所谓“新戏”来招徕观众。他们在取得大量上演税以后，生活腐化堕落。
    这些情况广东省和广州市文化局以及省市剧协是了解的，但他们一直容忍不加处理。直到最近有关领导机关和广大群众提出批评以后，文化部门才开始重视并决定采取措施加以处理。
