Xinhua News Agency dispatch: American newspapers continue to publish commentaries on the failure of the American satellite launch, with widespread complaints about Washington's "empty talk" and embarrassment.

    The "New York Herald Tribune" published a commentary by Alsop, saying: "Loss of confidence in American leaders is becoming increasingly common, and now confidence is completely lost... With the failure of the satellite, America's reputation has declined like never before. We have failed, that goes without saying, and now we are considered to be empty talkers and braggarts."

    Some newspapers, in light of recent events, emphasize that a re-examination of American diplomatic policy has now become an urgent matter. "New York Herald Tribune" reporter Higgins particularly emphasized this view. She called for abandoning certain stale dogmas that form the basis of American foreign policy, and first to re-examine America's attitude towards the Soviet Union. She asked, is now not the time to examine all the principles that determine our attitude towards the Soviet Union with new eyes?

    "U.S. News & World Report" magazine admitted that "America is now far behind the Soviet Union in the great race to build extremely powerful rockets." The failure of America to launch a tiny artificial satellite illustrates this point.

    The magazine said that even before the American artificial satellite launch failure on December 6, there had been "a series of failed rocket launch attempts." Earlier in the same week, defects were discovered in the "Atlas" intercontinental ballistic missile, forcing the fourth postponement of its test firing in four weeks. A few days before this, the testing of the "Jupiter" intermediate-range missile was declared a failure because the rocket engine failed a few minutes after launch. Defects were also found in the test firing of a long-range rocket with a "Snark" jet engine.

    The magazine also said: "The problems with the rocket carrying the artificial satellite had already arisen in the manufacture of ballistic test missiles with rocket engines."

    The "Chicago Sun-Times" wrote: "The humiliating ending of America's first launch of a small satellite has made America a laughingstock... People laugh at America, not so much because of the small size, delay or failure of the American satellite, but because America is accustomed to empty talk." The newspaper emphasized that the Soviet satellite showed the world that the Communists were not just talking big when they said they had ballistic rockets with a range of five thousand miles.

    The "Capital Times" published in Madison wrote: "We hope that the embarrassing situation encountered by the United States in the launch of the 'Vanguard' rocket can teach the United States, especially those in high positions in Washington, the much-needed humility. The habit of thinking that we can do everything because we are Americans should be abandoned."

### 发射卫星失败丢了脸  美国舆论怨声不绝  纷纷要求重新审查外交政策方针

    发射卫星失败丢了脸
    美国舆论怨声不绝
    纷纷要求重新审查外交政策方针
    本报综合报道  据新华社讯：美国报刊继续发表关于美国发射人造卫星失败的评论，对于华盛顿当局“放空炮”出了丑怨声四起。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”发表艾尔索普的评论说：“对美国领导人失掉信心日益成为平常的现象，而现在，信心是完全丧失了……随着卫星的失败，美国的声誉空前下降。我们已经失败，这自不待言，现在我们被认为是空谈者和吹牛家。”
    一些报纸就最近的事件强调指出，重新审查美国外交政策方针，现在已经成为迫不及待的事。“纽约先驱论坛报”女记者希金斯特别强调了这种看法。她呼吁放弃作为美国外交政策基础的某些陈腐的教条，首先要重新审查美国对苏联的态度。她问道，现在不正是用新的眼光考察决定我们对苏联的态度的一切原则的时候吗？
    “美国新闻与世界报道”杂志承认，“现在美国在建造极强大的火箭的大竞赛中比苏联落后了很多。”美国发射渺小的人造卫星的失败就说明了这一点。
    这家杂志说，早在12月6日美国人造卫星发射失败以前，就已经有“一系列发射火箭失败的尝试”。在同一周内的前一些时候，发现了“阿特拉斯”式洲际弹道火箭有缺陷，因而不得不在四周内第四次推迟这种火箭的试射。在这以前几天，由于火箭发动机在发射后几分钟失灵，“丘辟特”式中程导弹的试验宣告失败。在带有“斯纳克”喷气发动机的远程火箭试射时也发现了缺陷。
    杂志还说：“运载人造卫星的火箭的毛病，在制造有火箭发动机的弹道试验弹时就已经产生”。
    “芝加哥太阳时报”写道：“美国第一次发射小小卫星的丢脸的收场使美国成了笑柄……人家嘲笑美国，与其说是由于美国卫星的微小、推迟或失败，不如说是由于美国惯于放空炮”。报纸强调指出，苏联卫星向全世界表明，共产党说他们有射程五千英里的弹道火箭，并不是空说大话。
    麦迪逊出版的“首府时代报”写道：“我们希望，‘先锋’式火箭的发射使美国遭遇的尴尬境地，能够使美国，特别是使那些在华盛顿身居高位的人学会那种十分必需的谦虚。应当抛弃这种习惯，就是认为我们能做到一切，因为我们是美国人”。
