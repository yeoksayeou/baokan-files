    No Good Having Water Without Fertilizer
    In some townships in Guangling County, Yanbei Prefecture, Shanxi Province, after discovering that fertilizer accumulation work lagged behind water conservancy construction, the masses put forward the slogan "No good having water without fertilizer" and immediately launched a fertilizer accumulation campaign.
    In Guangling, it won't do to have water without fertilizer, and the same is true in other regions. Last year, the Xinjian Agricultural Cooperative in Zhouzhi County, Shaanxi Province, conducted fertilization and non-fertilization experiments on wheat fields. The comparative results were: wheat that was irrigated and fertilized yielded 363 jin per mu, while wheat that was only irrigated and not fertilized yielded 187 jin per mu. The yield differed by a factor of two.
    Regions that only focus on water conservancy and neglect fertilizer accumulation work should understand the principle of "No good having water without fertilizer" as soon as possible, and grasp water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation at the same time.

    有水无肥也不行
    山西雁北地区广灵县一些乡，在发现积肥工作落后于兴修水利以后，群众提出了“有水无肥也不行”的口号，立即展开了积肥运动。
    在广灵有水无肥不行，在别的地区也不行。陕西盩厔县新建农业社去年在麦田上作过施肥和不施肥的试验，对比的结果是：灌水又施肥的小麦亩产三百六十三斤，只灌水不施肥的，亩产一百八十七斤。两种情况，产量相差一倍。
    只顾修水利，不管积肥工作的地区，应该及早弄明白“有水无肥也不行”的道理，把兴修水利和积肥同时抓起来。
