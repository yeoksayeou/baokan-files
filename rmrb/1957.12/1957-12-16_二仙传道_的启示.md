　　Enlightenment from "Two Immortals Transmitting the Dao"
　　Jia Gong

　　I remember seeing a news item and a simple diagram about "Two Immortals Transmitting the Dao" and "Three Immortals Transmitting the Dao" in the People's Daily about a month ago. The editor also added a note, praising it as "valuable experience." At first, I didn't understand, but after reading it, I realized that it was a method of water diversion created by farmers in the mountainous areas of Shaanxi, used to "bring water up mountains and onto plateaus, transforming mountainous land into irrigated land."

　　"Transforming mountainous land into irrigated land" is a great thing. But there are two kinds of people when it comes to the "transformation" method. One kind is the creators of these "Immortals" and "Dao"; and the other kind is people who, upon hearing about water conservancy projects in the high mountains, immediately think of building large reservoirs and just hope that the state will invest money.

　　In fact, the latter can be further divided into two types.

　　One type has not seen the creativity of the masses and at the same time considers water conservancy construction in mountainous areas too difficult. So they feel that there is no other way except for "large reservoirs." The other type also fails to see the creativity of the farmers. In their eyes, these things with nice-sounding names like "Immortals" and "Dao" are just some extremely simple "toys." Calling them "valuable" and "creative" is enough to be laughed at as shallow: "Tsk, tsk, how can that compare to large reservoirs?"

　　I used to be one of those people who, "when it came to water conservancy construction in the high mountains," immediately "thought of" "money" and "reservoirs." However, I was only the first type of person among these; and my idea has been broken by this "Immortals" and "Dao" method.

　　I have lived in the mountains and on the plateaus of Shaanxi, and I deeply know that these "Immortals" and "Dao" creations are not simple at all.

　　I remember once, dozens of us were besieged by Hu Zongnan's bandit troops on a loess mountain in northern Shaanxi. The only farmer on this mountain had already fled with his family. We were hungry, thirsty, and exhausted to the point of distress. Fortunately, in a cave, we found a small bag of buckwheat flour and a small jar of lard that this family had "fortified." So, we quickly went to find water. After searching the entire mountain, we only found a small seepage pool, which the farmers used to collect rainwater for drinking. Probably because there had been no rain recently, the water was pitifully shallow. Mixed with mud and sand, we only managed to collect a little over half a bucket. We carried it back and agreed that no one could drink this water, in order to ensure that we could cook this buckwheat flour and solve the problems of hunger and thirst at the same time. We mixed the buckwheat flour and rubbed it into "cat ears," which is what the farmers in northern Shaanxi call "getong." When it was almost cooked, we stirred in the lard. Unexpectedly, there was no salt. The mud and sand mixed with the stale lard with its strange smell made it impossible to swallow. Only then did we regret not drinking a mouthful of cold water earlier. That night, we slept on the hillside, parched with thirst. We talked about the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and even talking about Quenching Thirst with Plums could not make our mouths water. Then we talked about Zhuge Liang's southern expedition to Zhu Tian to get a spring. We sighed with envy, wishing we could have that kind of luck. But we knew very well that even if the gods came, no water could be dug out on this mountain.

　　Another time, I experienced a dry summer on the plateau. Watching the seedlings on the plateau turn yellow and wither, while the low-lying river water, more than ten feet below the plateau, was slowly flowing downstream, unable to be used to save these seedlings. At that time, I was a cadre and thought I was "smarter" than the farmers. I really wanted to show off my abilities among them, but in the end, I was powerless.

　　These two incidents gave me the idea that relying solely on human power could not solve the "water" problem in the mountains and on the plateaus. And if this problem was not solved, there was no point in talking about developing and prospering the mountainous areas, and therefore the mountainous areas had no future. I was finally eager to get off the mountain.

　　However, the problem that I thought only gods could solve or perhaps could not solve at all was precisely solved by the farmers themselves. They named their creations "Immortals" and "Dao" intentionally. Whether the mountainous areas have a future or not cannot be conceived by "smart people" like me. It is firmly held in the hands of the farmers. Water has gone to the plateau, and it has also gone up the mountain. The future of prosperity in the mountainous areas has been revealed. But where are the gods? Where is the large machinery and equipment? Where are the bookworms filled with unrealistic ideas?

　　However, for the prosperity and construction of mountainous areas, this is only a beginning. When farmers are armed with science and technology, what are gods worth mentioning? Saying it is "valuable," in addition to its specific practical significance, is precisely because of its enlightenment about the collective power of farmers. How much wisdom is hidden in the farmers, and how urgently they need cultural enlightenment!

　　I think the farmers in the mountains and on the plateaus are unlikely not to understand that the role of "large reservoirs, water pumps, and locomobiles" is far greater than that of "Two Immortals Transmitting the Dao" and "Three Immortals Transmitting the Dao." But they understand the principle that "distant water cannot quench immediate thirst" even better. Rather than drawing cakes to satisfy hunger, it is better to eat cornbread first; although Quenching Thirst with Plums is superb, it is still better to drink a mouthful of cold water nearby. This is precisely where practical people who act according to their abilities are superior to learned visionaries. However, from here, we can also see that mountainous areas are also the most capable of absorbing culture and technology and have a great need for culture and technology. What the farmers have created is "Two Immortals Transmitting the Dao," but what they are hoping for are still "reservoirs" and "machines." If people with culture are willing to go to the mountains, they will be welcomed wholeheartedly, and there is a glorious and meaningful post for people with culture.

### “二仙传道”的启示

　　“二仙传道”的启示
　　贾恭
    记得大约一个月前，曾在人民日报上看到一条“二仙传道”“三仙传道”的新闻和一幅的简图，编者还加了按语，誉为“可贵的经验”，起初不解，读了之后，才明白是陕西山区农民们创造了一种引水方法，用它来“引水上山、上塬，变山地为水地”。
    “变山地为水地”，是件大好事。但在“变”法上，是有着两种人的。一种就是这“仙”、“道”的创作者们；而另一种，则是一听要在高山兴修水利，就想到修大型水库，只盼望着国家拿钱投资的人们。
    其实，后者又可分为两种。
    一种由于未曾看到群众的创造性，同时又把在山区兴修水利看得过难，于是便感到，除了“大型水库”以外，是再没有办法了的。另一种也是看不到农民的创造性。在他们眼里，这有着“仙”、“道”之类好听名字的东西，只不过是些极简陋的“玩艺”，称之为“可贵”和“创造”，足以被笑作浅薄的：“啧，啧，那能同大型水库相比吗？”
    我原也曾是“一说到在高山上兴修水利”，便“想到”“钱”和“库”的人。不过，我却只是这类人中的第一种；而且，我的这想法，已被这“仙”“道”的方法打破了。
    我在陕西的山上和塬上居住过，深知这些“仙”、“道”的创举，实在不简单。
    记得有一次，我们几十个人，被胡宗南匪军围困在陕北的一个土山上。这山上原来仅有的一个农民，早已携家逃避了。我们饥渴疲劳，都已到了难堪的地步，幸喜在一个土洞里，找到了这家“坚壁”下的一小袋荞面，一小罐猪油；于是，我们赶快去找水。经过遍山的搜索，只找到了一个小小的渗池，是农民用来引储食用的雨水的。大概由于近日无雨，水已浅少得可怜。夹泥带沙，也只收得了半桶多。抬回来，我们共同约定，谁也不能喝这水，以便保证煮熟这点荞面，一箭双雕地解决饥和渴的问题。我们把荞面拌和起来，搓成“猫儿朵”，就是陕北农民叫作“圪桶”的那东西。临熟还搅拌上猪油。不料没有盐，泥沙混杂上陈腐了的猪油的带异味的油腻，使人无法下咽，这才后悔还不如刚才喝口凉水的好。晚上露宿在山坡上，渴得难受，我们便谈论起三国演义来，说了望梅止渴，也还不能舌下生津，于是又说诸葛亮南征祝天取泉的事。我们叹羡着，如果能有这运气多好。但我们又明明知道，就是神仙来了，这山上也掘不出水来。
    另一次是在塬上经历过一个干旱的夏天。眼看着塬上的禾苗焦黄枯萎了，而十多丈高的塬下，低沉的河水正在缓缓地向下流逝去，无法用它来解救这些禾苗。我当时是干部，自以为比农民“聪明”些，很想在他们当中显出一番作为来，但却终于无能为力。
    两件事给了我这样的念头：只靠人力是无法解决山上和塬上“水”的问题，而这问题不解决，开发和繁荣山区的事，便无从说起，因而山区也是没有前途的了。我终于下山心切了。
    然而，被我认为只有神仙才能解决或也解决不了的问题，却正是农民们自己解决的。他们把自己的创造命名为“仙”、“道”，是有意趣的。山区的有无前途，原来并不能由我这样的“聪明人”去设想，它被紧紧掌握在农民们的手里。水上塬了，也上山了，山区的繁荣前途展现出来了，可是，神仙在哪里？大的机械设备在哪里？空想的饱学家们又在哪里呢？
    然而，对于山区的繁荣和建设来说，这还只不过是一个开端。当农民们用科学和技术武装起来以后，神仙何足道哉。说它是“可贵的”，除了它的实践的具体意义以外，正是它关于农民集体力量的这种启示。农民是蕴藏有多大的智慧而又多么急切需要文化的启发啊！
    我想，山上的和塬上的农民，是不至于不懂得“大水库、抽水机、锅驼机”的作用，要远远大于这“二仙传道”、“三仙传道”的。但他们更明白“远水不解近渴”的道理。与其画饼充饥，不如先吃窝窝头；望梅止渴虽属高超，却还不如就近喝口凉水的来得实际。这正是量力而行的实践家比饱学的空想家高明的地方。然而，从这里也能看出：山区也是最能吸收文化、技术和大量需要文化、技术的地方。农民们创造的是“二仙传道”，但想望的还是“库”和“机”，有文化的人倘愿意到山上去，是会受到十二分欢迎的，而且那里也正是有文化的人的光荣而又有意义的岗位。
