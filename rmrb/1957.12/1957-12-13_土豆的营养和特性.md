　　The Nutrition and Characteristics of Potatoes
　　Zheng Sufang
    The potato, also known as the Solanum tuberosum, yam bean, and foreign potato, is a food that can be used both as a grain and as a vegetable. From a nutritional point of view, it contains more protein and carbohydrates, as well as some minerals and vitamins. A pound of potatoes contains about a quarter of the protein and carbohydrates found in a pound of rice or flour, and four ounces of potatoes can generate 98 kilocalories of heat. Therefore, from a nutritional point of view, it has the characteristics of providing caloric energy like grain. At the same time, although the calcium content of potatoes is less than that of vegetables and some grains, it contains vitamin C, which grains lack, and the content is very high. Four ounces of potatoes contain more than 20 milligrams, which is much higher than tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots, eggplants, and common fruits such as watermelon, apples, peaches, pears, bananas, and crabapples. Therefore, it also has the characteristics of a vegetable.
    In addition to the above nutritional advantages, potatoes are also easy to store. In terms of cooking methods, it is suitable for various cooking methods, such as steaming, boiling, baking, stir-frying, deep-frying, making soup, and can be added to flour to make steamed buns. It can be cooked into sweet or savory dishes and is very delicious. Because potatoes do not have tough tendons (coarse fiber), they are also a very suitable food for children.
    In order to reduce the loss of various nutrients during cooking, it is best not to peel potatoes when steaming, boiling, or baking them. Potatoes turn brown when peeled or cut, because of the action of polyphenol oxidase in the air. To maintain the clean color of potatoes, many housewives soak peeled or cut potatoes in water. Although this method can avoid enzymatic oxidation and maintain the color of the potatoes, it loses a lot of nutrients. Therefore, it is best to peel the potatoes just before cooking, and do not cut them too early and soak them in water.
    One thing to note when eating potatoes: when potatoes sprout, the sprouted part will produce a lot of solanine, and excessive consumption of solanine can cause poisoning. Therefore, if you buy sprouted potatoes, be sure to remove the sprouted part before eating to avoid poisoning.

　　土豆的营养和特性
　　郑素芳
    土豆又叫马铃薯、山药蛋和洋芋，它是一种既可作粮食用又可作蔬菜用的食物。从营养价值来看，它含有较多的蛋白质和碳水化合物，以及一些矿物质和维生素。一斤土豆所含蛋白质和碳水化合物约为一斤米、面的四分之一，四两土豆就可产生热量九十八仟卡。所以，从营养观点看，它是具有粮食供应热量的特点。同时，土豆所含的钙质虽比蔬菜和某些谷类要少一些，但是它含有谷类所缺少的维生素丙，并且含量很高，四两土豆中就含有二十多毫克，比西红柿、黄瓜、胡萝卜、茄子及常吃的水果如西瓜、苹果、桃、梨、香蕉、沙果等的含量都要高得多，所以它又具有蔬菜的特点。
    土豆除了在营养上有以上优点外，还便于贮藏。在烹调方法上，它适用于各种的烹调方法，如蒸、煮、烤、炒、炸、作汤，掺入面粉可作馒头，烹调成甜咸味都很可口。由于土豆没有坚韧的筋（粗纤维），也是一种很适合幼儿吃的食物。
    为了在烹调时减少各种营养素的损失，在蒸、煮、烤土豆时，最好不削皮。土豆削去皮或切后会变成棕色，这是因为多酚氧化酶在空气中的作用。许多家庭主妇为了保持土豆的洁净颜色，就将削去皮或切了的土豆浸泡在水中。这种方法虽然可以避免的酶氧化作用，保持土豆的色泽，但营养素则损失很多。所以做菜的时候，最好临下锅时才削皮，不要很早切好泡在水里。
    吃土豆应当注意一件事：当土豆发芽时，发芽部分会产生很多的龙葵素，人吃了过多的龙葵素会中毒。所以买到已经发芽的土豆，一定要把发芽部分去掉才食用，以免发生中毒现象。
