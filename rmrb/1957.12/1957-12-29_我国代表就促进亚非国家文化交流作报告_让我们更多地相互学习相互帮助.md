Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, December 27th: Chu Tu-nan, Deputy Head of the Chinese Delegation to the Asian-African Solidarity Conference, delivered a report on promoting cultural exchange among Asian and African countries at the plenary session on the afternoon of the 27th.

He said, "Only by carrying out cultural exchange can we promote mutual understanding and friendly cooperation among the people of all countries, and it is conducive to promoting and safeguarding the national independence movement, and conducive to opposing war and defending peace."

Chu Tu-nan said, "Our meeting is to express the hopes and voices of 1.6 billion people in Asia and Africa." He said, "Our Asia and Africa were once the cradle and birthplace of great religions and civilizations of mankind. The various nations of Asia and Africa have made valuable and brilliant contributions to human culture in the long past. In the future, we also have our own serious responsibility in developing our national cultures and thus making human culture further prosper."

Chu Tu-nan said, "One of the characteristics of cultural development in Asia and Africa is the peaceful and friendly cultural exchange between Asian and African countries and nations for thousands of years. Our ancestors risked their lives and overcame extremely difficult obstacles, passing through deserts, jungles, seas, and high mountains, to open up the roads of cultural exchange. They left us, the people of Asia and Africa, and the whole world with a glorious example for seeking knowledge, friendship, human happiness, and carrying out peaceful and friendly cultural exchanges among the people of all countries. "The history of cultural exchange between Asian and African countries in the past thousands of years is also a great epic of peace and friendship in the world."

Chu Tu-nan said, "Unfortunately, in modern times, due to the intrusion of colonialism, the peaceful life of the people of Asian and African countries has been disrupted, their culture has been ravaged, and cultural exchange and friendly exchanges have been interrupted. The people of our Asian and African countries have suffered the same tragic fate."

"Some colonialists came to our land with weapons, and some in various disguises. In order to greedily suck the rich resources and endless labor of our countries, they adopted coercive blackmail and deceptive policies to enslave us. On the one hand, they despised and conspired to obliterate the great historical culture of various nations, and forced the title of 'backward' on us in order to deprive us of our national self-confidence; and they wantonly destroyed cultural monuments of various countries and stole precious cultural relics of various countries. On the other hand, they spread their own set of decadent 'culture' which paved the way for aggression everywhere, attempting to fundamentally poison us. They tried every means to provoke relations between Asian and African countries and to obstruct and cut off cultural exchanges between countries. As a result, our progress has been hindered, our development has encountered difficulties, and colonialism has taken advantage of this to invade and enslave us more deeply."

Chu Tu-nan said that now, the people of Asian and African countries have finally stood up. But we cannot and should not forget the days of suffering and humiliation.

Chu Tu-nan then reviewed the rapid development of cultural exchanges between the people of Asian and African countries in recent years, and narrated the facts of the extensive cultural exchanges between the Chinese people and the people of various countries since the founding of the People's Republic of China. He pointed out: "Every country has its unique experience in culture and science, which is worthy of reference by other countries. For example, India's water conservancy projects, Egypt's cotton planting experience, Japan's rice planting, Nepal's architectural art, etc., are all worthy of our study in China."

Chu Tu-nan said, "We should exchange more information with each other, hold more exhibitions and other diverse cultural activities to satisfy the people of all countries' kind concern for their ancient neighbors, constantly enhance each other's mutual understanding and friendship, and encourage and support each other. The most important thing is we must be good at learning from each other and helping each other in science and technology."

"Scientists from Asian and African countries know that in the great and extremely arduous undertaking of completing national economic and cultural construction and leading all mankind to march into the universe, our burden is very heavy. In this regard, the great Soviet people, as one of the attending countries of our conference, have already taken the lead in the world and have achieved extremely brilliant and great achievements. This is our common glory. We believe that through the mutual unity, friendship, mutual assistance, cooperation, and common progress of the people of Asian and African countries, the people of Asian and African countries will surely make glorious contributions to the new culture of mankind that are worthy of our ancestors."

Chu Tu-nan said, "When we talk about the new culture of mankind, undoubtedly we still regard the culture of the whole world as a whole. We actively promote cultural exchange, solidarity, and friendship among Asian and African countries, but this does not mean ignoring, and of course not rejecting, cultural ties with Western countries and the solidarity and friendship with the people of Western countries. On the contrary, cultural ties with Western countries and mutual understanding and friendship between peoples should also continue to be strengthened; but this kind of connection must be carried out on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect. We safeguard our national independence and freedom, love our national culture, and at the same time respect the independence and freedom of other countries and other nations, and respect the culture of other nations. Under this principle of natural justice, we welcome cultural exchanges and mutual learning between the people of Eastern and Western countries."

"We must oppose the cultural aggression disguised by imperialists in various forms, and we must be vigilant against the decadent and degenerate cultural toxins that imperialists are using to lure, paralyze, and corrupt our vigorous youth. At the same time, we must also guard against imperialists' various conspiracies to undermine our cultural exchanges and hinder our cultural prosperity. We must promote the normal and healthy international cultural exchange to flourish on these solemn lands of Asia and Africa while carrying forward national culture and developing human culture."

Chu Tu-nan concluded by saying, "The friendly unity, cooperative mutual assistance, and peaceful progress of the people of Asia and Africa are important guarantees for the development of economic construction and cultural prosperity in Asian and African countries, and are also urgently demanded by the people of Asian and African countries. Today, the people of Asia and Africa are further united, and Asian and African culture is also exuding the fragrance of spring like green shoots on ancient trees."

    我国代表就促进亚非国家文化交流作报告
    让我们更多地相互学习相互帮助
    据新华社开罗27日电　出席亚非团结大会的中国代表团副团长楚图南在27日下午的全体会议上作了关于促进亚非国家间文化交流的报告。
    他说：“只有开展文化交流，才能促进各国人民之间的相互了解和友好合作，并且有利于推动和维护民族独立运动，有利于反对战争和保卫和平。”
    楚图南说：“我们的会议是要表达亚非国家十六亿人民的希望和呼声。”他说：“我们亚洲和非洲曾经是人类伟大宗教和文明的摇篮和发祥地。我们亚洲和非洲的各个民族，在过去悠久的岁月中，对人类文化都有过有价值的辉煌的贡献。在今后发展自己的民族文化从而使人类文化得到进一步的繁荣昌盛，也就有着自己的严重的责任。”
    楚图南说：“亚非两洲文化发展的特点之一，就是几千年来亚非各国和各民族间和平友好的文化交流。我们的祖先曾经冒着生命的危险，克服异常艰巨的困难，通过沙漠丛林、大海高山，开辟着文化交流的道路。他们为求知识、求友谊、求人类的幸福和开展各国人民间的和平友好的文化交流，给我们亚非人民也给全世界留下了光辉的典范。”“过去数千年亚非各国间文化交流的历史，也是世界上一部伟大的和平友好的史诗”。
    楚图南说：“不幸的是，在近代以来，由于殖民主义的侵入，亚非各国人民的和平生活被破坏了，文化被摧残了，文化交流和友好往来被中断了，我们亚非各国人民都遭到了同样悲惨的命运。”
    “殖民主义者有的挟着武器，有的披着各色各样的外衣，来到了我们的国土上。他们为了要尽情地吮吸我们各个国家的丰厚的资源和无穷的劳力，就采取威胁讹诈和愚民政策来奴役我们。一方面，他们蔑视并阴谋抹煞各国民族的伟大历史文化，硬给我们加上‘落后’的称号，用以剥夺我们的民族自信心；并且大肆破坏各国文化古迹，盗窃各国的珍贵文物。另一方面，他们到处散布自己那套为侵略开路的腐朽的‘文化’，企图从根本上毒化我们。他们千方百计地挑拨亚非各国之间的关系，阻挠和截断各国之间的文化交流。于是我们的进步遭到阻碍，我们的发展遇到困难，而殖民主义更因利乘便，更深地来侵略我们和奴役我们。”
    楚图南说，现在，亚非各国人民终于站起来了。但是那一段苦难和屈辱的日子是我们大家不能也不应该忘记掉的。
    楚图南接着回顾了亚非各国人民之间的文化交流近几年来迅速发展的况状，并且叙述了中国人民从中华人民共和国成立以来同各国人民进行广泛文化交流的事实。他指出：“每一个国家在文化科学上都有其独特的经验，值得其他国家参考。例如，印度的水利工程，埃及的植棉经验，日本的水稻种植，尼泊尔的建筑艺术等等，都是值得我们中国学习的”。
    楚图南说：“我们彼此间应该交换更多的资料，举办更多的展览以及其他多种多样的文化活动，来满足各国人民对于古老邻居的亲切的关怀，不断增进彼此的相互了解和友谊，并且相互鼓舞，相互支援，其中最重要的是我们必须善于在科学技术上相互学习和相互帮助。”
    “亚非各国的科学家们知道，在完成国家经济文化建设和全人类向宇宙进军的伟大而极其艰巨的事业中，我们的担子是很重的。在这方面，作为我们这次会议的出席国之一的伟大的苏联人民已经走在世界的先头，并且获得了极为光辉伟大的成就。这是我们共同的光荣。我们相信，经过亚非各国人民相互的团结友好，互助合作，共同进步，亚非各国人民必然会给人类新的文化作出无愧于我们祖先的辉煌的贡献。”
    楚图南说：“当我们谈到人类新文化的时候，无疑地我们仍然是把全世界的文化看作一个整体的。我们积极促进亚非国家彼此的文化交流、团结友好，但这并不等于忽视、当然更不是拒绝同西方各国的文化联系和同西方各国人民的团结友好。相反地，同西方国家的文化联系和人民之间的相互了解和友谊，也应该继续加强；但是这种联系必须在平等互利、彼此尊重的基础上来进行。我们维护自己的民族独立自由，热爱自己的民族文化，同时也尊重别的国家别的民族的独立自由，尊重别的民族的文化。在这个天经地义的原则下，我们欢迎东西方各国人民之间的文化交流和互相学习。”
    “我们必须反对帝国主义者用各种形式伪装起来的文化侵略，必须警惕帝国主义者正在用腐朽堕落的文化毒素来诱惑、麻痹和败坏我们的朝气蓬勃的青年。同时，我们也必须提防帝国主义者以各种阴谋来破坏我们的文化交流，阻挠我们的文化繁荣。我们要在亚洲、非洲这两片庄严的大地上，在发扬民族文化和发展人类文化的同时，促使正常的健康的国际文化交流繁荣昌盛起来。”
    楚图南最后说：“亚非人民的友好团结、合作互助、和平进步是发展亚非各国经济建设和繁荣文化的重要的保证，也是亚非各国人民所迫切要求的。今天亚非人民正在进一步团结起来，亚非文化也像古树发青那样发出春天的芬芳。”
