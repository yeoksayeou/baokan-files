    Tiger Skin Tofu
    Buy two blocks of tofu and half a liang of maoxia (small shrimp, i.e., dried shrimp). Cut the tofu into small squares and pan-fry until golden brown. Add the maoxia and soy sauce, and bring to a boil. Then add a small amount of white sugar, chopped scallions or garlic leaves, and cook further until the aroma of scallions is noticeable. Serve. (Li Bochang)

    Emerald Fish Balls
    Buy a large yellow croaker (or bighead carp or carp). Mince the fish meat (with the bones removed), then chop and press it into a fish paste with the back of a knife. Add salt water and stir for fifteen minutes (half a liang of water can be added to one liang of yellow croaker meat). Once it becomes a paste, add a little MSG and cornstarch, mix well, and shape into balls.
    When cooking, first bring the water to a boil, then add a little cold water to maintain a rolling boil, and poach the fish balls until cooked through. Add a little salt and cooking wine to the soup, and then add small squares of blanched bok choy. When serving, drizzle with freshly fried scallion oil. Enjoy! (Zhao Wenhai)

    家常菜
    虎皮豆腐
    买豆腐两块、毛虾（即虾皮）半两。把豆腐切成小方块，用油煎成黄色；加入毛虾和酱油一同煮滚；然后放入少量白糖、葱花或蒜叶，再煮，闻葱香即可盛起。　（李伯昌）
    翡翠鱼丸
    买大黄鱼（胖头鱼或鲤鱼均可）一条，把鱼肉（剔去鱼骨）剁成肉末，再用刀背剁压成鱼泥，加入盐水搅打十五分钟（一两大黄鱼肉可加半两水），成糊状，即加入少许味精和生粉，搅匀，做成丸子。
    烹调时，先将水烧开，再略加冷水落滚，就将丸子氽熟。汤内加点细盐和料酒，再把切成小方块、用开水烫过的油菜放入。起锅时，浇上一点现炸的葱油，即可食用。　（赵文海）
