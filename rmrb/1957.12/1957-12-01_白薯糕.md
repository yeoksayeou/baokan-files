Sweet Potato Cake
    Ingredients: One catty of sweet potatoes, one catty of cornmeal. Total cost approximately 14 cents.
    Instructions: Wash the sweet potatoes and shred them finely. Place them in a basin and cover with a pot lid (to prevent nutrient loss). Mix the cornmeal with lukewarm water to a consistency that is neither too soft nor too hard. Then, thinly spread a layer of cornmeal on a steamer rack (the rack should be lined with a clean cloth), sprinkle a layer of shredded sweet potatoes, and then another layer of cornmeal. Gently pat the surface smooth and cover with the steamer lid. Steam over high heat for 30 to 40 minutes until cooked. Remove, cut into pieces, and serve as a main course for three people.
    Sweet potato cake is not only economical but also nutritious. We can obtain 1,815 kcal of energy, 45 grams of protein, 21.5 grams of fat, 360 grams of carbohydrates, 7.5 grams of crude fiber, 110 milligrams of calcium, 1,550 milligrams of phosphorus, 17 milligrams of iron, and various vitamins from each catty of cornmeal.

    白薯糕
    材料：白薯一斤，玉米面一斤。共约一角四分钱。
    做法：将白薯洗净，擦成细丝，放在盆内用锅盖盖上（不盖容易损失营养）；再将玉米面用温水和得不软不硬；然后在蒸屉上薄薄地铺一层玉米面（屉上要铺清洁的屉布），洒一层白薯丝，再在上面铺一层玉米面，轻轻地将表面拍平，盖上屉帽。用大火蒸三十分钟到四十分钟即熟，取出切成块，可供三人主食用。
    白薯糕不但经济，而且营养丰富。我们从每一斤玉米面即可得到热量1，815仟卡，蛋白质45克，脂肪21.5克，碳水化合物360克，粗纤维7.5克，钙110毫克，磷1，550毫克，铁17毫克，以及各种维生素；每一斤白薯可供给热量559仟卡，胡萝卜素5·76毫克，其他维生素含量也很丰富。　（钟华淑）
