Xinhua News Agency, December 6th. At the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions today, thirteen representatives spoke at the congress, expressing their intention to conscientiously implement the spirit of this congress, mobilize the broad masses of workers to launch a new mass production upsurge on the basis of the rectification movement, and to do everything possible to implement the policy of building the country and running enterprises with diligence and thrift, and to support agricultural production with practical actions.

　　Wang Jiayang (Minister of the Production Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions) focused on the issue of welcoming a new upsurge in production in his speech. He said that the new upsurge in production is different from previous production upsurges in terms of its foundation and conditions. It is developing on the basis of the great rectification movement. He said that in the new production upsurge, trade union organizations must, under the leadership of the Party, carry out the rectification movement to the end, invigorate democratic life through the rectification movement, and vigorously improve their work. They should work with the enterprise administration to summarize and promote advanced experiences well. They should pay attention to various initiatives and be good at using typical examples to promote the overall situation. At the same time, they should also improve the work of rationalization proposals, pay attention to the role of veteran workers, and carry out a variety of competition activities.

　　Zhang Zhaomei (Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Petroleum Trade Union) cited many examples in his speech to illustrate that the signs of a new production upsurge have begun to appear in petroleum industrial enterprises. He said that in the face of such a new situation, we must have clear goals and requirements to make it a huge force for in-depth development of increasing production and practicing economy in the petroleum industry system.

　　Han Limin (Chairman of the Trade Union of the Shandong Paper Mill) and Cao Guifang (Leader of the Trade Union Group of the Fine Yarn Workshop of the Northwest First Textile Mill) introduced the experiences of their factories and groups in carrying out socialist competition and trade union work in accordance with the policy of building the country and running enterprises with diligence and thrift.

　　Chen Qingquan (Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Federation of Trade Unions) explained in his speech the importance of trade union organizations mobilizing workers to support agricultural production. He said that in supporting agricultural production, the tasks of trade union organizations are: to widely organize the masses of workers to study and discuss the "National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) from 1956 to 1967", strengthen the ties between workers and peasants, and formulate plans to support agricultural production on this basis. In all enterprises that produce and supply production materials and living materials for farmers, trade union organizations should mobilize workers to carry out socialist competition and support agricultural production with practical actions. It is also necessary to strengthen the leadership of county and town trade union work so that county and town trade union work closely revolves around the development of agricultural production.

　　Jia Hongkui (Vice Chairman of the Trade Union of the Jilin Fertilizer Plant) used the construction and production situation of the Jilin Fertilizer Plant in his speech to illustrate the great significance of industry supporting agriculture.

　　Zhao Xishan (Chairman of the Trade Union of Yan'an County, Shaanxi Province) introduced in his speech how the workers of Yan'an have consistently carried forward the spirit of hard work, plain living, and diligence and thrift in running enterprises in the past. He especially introduced the Fengzu Firecracker Factory in Yan'an.

　　Xin Guangyi (Chairman of the Qingdao Municipal Federation of Trade Unions) said in his speech that during the construction period in our country, with the development of the national economy, the state has invested in many welfare undertakings, which has significantly improved the lives of workers. However, because the living problems of workers are multifaceted, especially under the current economic conditions in our country, many welfare problems cannot be solved all at once. Therefore, educating and organizing workers to use their own strength to solve the problems that they can solve is an important task of trade union organizations.

　　Wu Liangxian, a dockworker and advanced producer from the Shanghai Port Authority, also introduced in his speech the methods they use to overcome the difficulties of the masses by relying on the strength of the masses. Their grassroots trade union established a mutual aid association for the deaths of family members of workers. The mutual aid regulations stipulate that if a direct family member of a worker dies, each member contributes two cents. Based on 3,400 people in their loading and unloading area, a worker whose family member dies can receive 68 yuan, which solves a big problem. However, for each person who contributes two cents, there is no impact, and it can enhance unity and friendship among workers.

　　Wang Yingpu (Deputy Secretary-General of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions) introduced the situation of the Beijing trade union organizations running family nurseries in his speech. He said that nurseries have many benefits: they cost less money, solve more problems, and are easy to run with the active support and care of the masses.

　　Wang Rong (Minister of the Wage Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions) focused on issues related to trade union wage work in his speech. He said that with the tremendous development of our country's national economy, the increase in the wage level of workers and the growth of the total wage amount are quite rapid. It is estimated that the average wage of workers nationwide this year will be 42.8% higher than in 1952, and the total wage amount is expected to increase by 1.2 times compared to 1952. The lives of workers in our country have not only greatly improved compared to before liberation, but the wages of the vast majority of workers are also significantly higher than before the War of Resistance Against Japan. However, there are still many problems in the current wage work. In this rectification movement, workers have raised many criticisms and opinions on wage work. The opinions are mainly not about the level of wages, but that the wage relationships between various types of personnel are not reasonable enough, some wage systems are not practical enough, the piecework quotas have the phenomenon of being too loose or too tight, the bonus wage system is somewhat chaotic, etc. Through this rectification movement, we must strive to overcome these shortcomings and improve our work. Wang Rong also pointed out that publicizing the wage policies of the Party and the state, strengthening ideological and political education, raising the awareness of workers, and correctly handling wage issues on the basis of raising the awareness of workers are one of the important and regular tasks of the trade union. It is wrong to ignore the material incentive role of wages, but excessively emphasizing the material incentive role and relaxing ideological and political work for workers will promote the individualism, departmentalism, and egalitarianism of workers. The trade union must seriously deal with the appeals and demands of workers regarding wage issues, depending on the situation. Trade union organizations should not be afraid of being tedious, regardless of whether they are large or small, and should ensure that everything is explained and everything is resolved. Wang Rong also emphasized that the trade union must publicize and explain to all trade union cadres and the broad masses of workers that everything must start from the perspective of 600 million people, from the perspective of developing production, and from the perspective of consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, and correctly treat the relationship between wages and production.

　　Wei Xizhuo (Chairman of the Trade Union of the Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant), Cui Dongxuan (Vice Chairman of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture Federation of Trade Unions) and other representatives also spoke at the congress.

　　The congress will continue tomorrow.

Xinhua News Agency, December 6th. At the plenary meeting of the Eighth National Congress of Trade Unions held today, eleven trade union representatives from Asia, Africa, and Europe addressed the meeting. They expressed warm congratulations to the congress and emphasized that the working class of all countries should further strengthen mutual contact and unity.

　　Hachin Dalief, Deputy Secretary-General of the Central Trade Union of the Republic of Indonesia, focused on the struggle of the Indonesian people for the liberation of West Irian in his speech. He said that for this struggle, Indonesian workers have now carried out the second stage of action, carrying out a continuous 24-hour strike in all Dutch enterprises. Hachin Dalief believes that the Indonesian people will surely receive the support of Chinese workers and workers all over the world in this struggle. He said that your support will surely enhance the common spirit of fighting against colonialism and defending world peace. At the end of his speech, warm applause broke out in the hall. The Executive Chairman of the Congress stated that the Chinese working class will unswervingly support the just struggle of the Indonesian people to recover West Irian.

　　Reza Rusta, Secretary-General of the Central Federation of Iranian Workers and Working People's Trade Unions, delivered a speech. He said that although all the people of Iran demand the establishment of diplomatic relations with China, the ruling group of Iran, following the instructions of American imperialism, still does not recognize the People's Republic of China. As the Iranian proverb says, "Although the bat does not want to see the sun, the value and usefulness of the sun are not diminished because of this." He believes that in the near future, under the pressure of the masses of people from the Persian Gulf to the Caspian Sea, the Iranian government will be forced to recognize China. His speech was warmly welcomed by all the representatives.

　　Mitsuo Fujioka, Vice Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, extended warm congratulations to the congress on behalf of the 3.5 million members of the General Council. He said, "We are watching the development of socialism in China and are willing to draw various experiences from it." After pointing out that the mutual exchanges between Chinese and Japanese workers have developed, Fujioka Mitsuo said, "We believe that the struggle of Japanese workers and people will become a great force and will force the Japanese government to restore diplomatic relations between China and Japan."

　　Fukuhei Ichikawa, Chairman of the Japan Federation of Industrial Organizations, said in his speech that not only Japanese workers, but also workers in Asia, the Arab world, and all over the world are concerned about your congress and wish the congress success. He expressed his belief that the Chinese working class will definitely be able to build China into a great, prosperous, and strong socialist country.

　　Rakuzo Sato, a representative of the Japan National Federation of Industrial Unions, expressed his admiration for China's great socialist construction and the achievements of the trade union in his congratulatory speech. He said that if the frequent exchanges between Chinese and Japanese workers continue, then other Japanese trade union organizations that did not come to participate in the congress with us this time will soon open up friendly roads with Chinese trade unions. Sato Rakuzo said that the connection between Chinese and Japanese workers will surely become a force to promote the restoration of diplomatic relations and peaceful development between the two countries.

　　After delivering their speeches, representatives from these three trade union organizations in Japan presented gifts to the congress. The Executive Chairman of the Congress expressed his gratitude to them and said that the friendly unity and mutual support between Chinese and Japanese workers and people will surely be able to make outstanding contributions in opposing the manufacture and testing of atomic and hydrogen bombs and in the struggle for peace in Asia and the world.

　　Han Sang-doo, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Vocational Alliance, expressed his gratitude in his speech on behalf of the Korean working class to the Chinese working class and all the Chinese people who actively assisted Korea during the war and post-war period. He said that the friendship between the people of Korea and China has a long history, and the heroic struggle and friendly relations between the two peoples have not only made great contributions to peace in Asia and the world, but have also become an example of fully developing and demonstrating noble proletarian internationalism and noble moral character. Han Sang-doo said that now the American imperialists and Syngman Rhee are violating the armistice agreement and attempting to re-ignite the war in Korea. However, no matter how much the American imperialists ignore the wishes of the Korean people, their aggressive conspiracies will surely be shattered, and the peaceful reunification of Korea will surely be achieved. After delivering his speech, Han Sang-doo presented the congress with a banner and gifts.

　　Pareed, a representative of the Mauritius Agricultural Workers Union, said in his speech that they felt very honored to be able to come to China. He said that we, like other oppressed and backward countries that are still bound by imperialism, have also found strength from China, the Soviet Union, and other people's democratic countries to encourage ourselves and carry out the struggle for political and economic liberation.

　　D. Balajinnim, Chairman of the Central Council of Mongolian Trade Unions, extended warm greetings to the Chinese trade union and the working class on behalf of the Mongolian trade union. He said in his congratulatory speech that the Chinese working class, together with all the people, has achieved great achievements in socialist construction. These facts prove to the world the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. Thanks to the fraternal and selfless assistance of the great neighbor, the Soviet Union and China, the Mongolian People's Republic has made great progress in developing its economy and culture in recent years. The Mongolian people are infinitely delighted by the selfless help China has given us. Our task is to continue to develop and consolidate this friendship and connection. After delivering his speech, Balajinnim presented the congress with a banner, a film, porcelain, and other gifts.

　　Bolesław Gibert, a representative of the Central Council of Polish Trade Unions, said in his speech that the Polish people have sincere and fraternal sympathy and friendship for the heroic Chinese working class and the Chinese people. We have a very high evaluation of the role played by the great Chinese people in consolidating world peace and opening up the path of social progress in the world. The Polish people and the entire working class attach particular importance to the increasingly close cooperation with Chinese trade unions. After delivering his speech, Gibert presented the congress with a statue of a mermaid modeled after the coat of arms of Warsaw.

　　Bascu Nicolae, Secretary of the Central Council of Romanian Trade Unions, said in his speech that the achievements made by the Chinese people on the road of socialist construction have consolidated and enhanced the international status and influence of the People's Republic of China as a great power. Romania and China have the common goal of building socialism and the common will to consolidate peace. These common things make the people and trade union organizations of our two countries forever closely united. After delivering his speech, Nicolae also presented gifts to the congress.

　　Hoang Quoc Viet, Chairman of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, conveyed in his speech the congratulations of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor and all the working people of Vietnam to the congress. He said that the creative and extraordinary achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Chairman Mao in the anti-imperialist struggle and today's socialist reform and socialist construction have made the invincible socialist ideology more brilliant and made the people of all countries who are fighting against colonialism and against the warmongers of imperialism more full of confidence in the struggle. The Vietnamese people and the Vietnamese trade union have always regarded the Chinese working people and the Chinese revolutionary movement as their example. He expressed that they will further strengthen the close unity between the peoples of the two countries in the future. After delivering his speech, Hoang Quoc Viet presented the congress with a flag and gifts.

　　Chen Yongwen, Deputy Secretary-General of the Congress, read out the congratulatory letter from the Italian General Confederation of Labor to the Congress at today's meeting. The congratulatory letter, signed by Santi and Lama, Secretaries of the Secretariat of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, said that the Italian General Confederation of Labor is facing some difficult and urgent problems due to the sudden death of its General Secretary, Comrade Vittorio, and therefore can only send this congratulatory letter to the Congress. The congratulatory letter said that we know that the Chinese working class and the Chinese people have not only completed and overfulfilled the first five-year plan, but are also preparing to realize even more ambitious plans. Italian workers are convinced that one day they will also embark on the same path as you.

    在中国工会第八次全国代表大会上
　　工会代表决心贯彻执行大会精神
　  发动群众掀起生产新高潮
    十一位外宾强调加强各国工人阶级的团结
    据新华社6日讯　中国工会第八次全国代表大会今天继续举行。十三位代表在大会上发言，表示要认真贯彻执行这次大会的精神，发动广大职工在整风运动的基础上，掀起一个群众性的新生产高潮；要千方百计贯彻执行勤俭建国、勤俭办企业的方针，用实际行动支援农业生产。
    王家扬（全国总工会生产部部长）代表在发言中着重谈到了迎接生产新高潮的问题。他说，新的生产高潮同以往生产高潮的基础和条件都有所不同，它是在伟大的整风运动基础上发展起来的。他说，工会组织在新的生产高潮中，必须在党的领导下把整风运动进行到底，通过整风运动，活跃民主生活，狠狠地改进工作。要协同企业行政方面很好地总结和推广先进经验。重视各种创举，要善于运用典型推动全盘。同时，还要改进合理化建议工作，注意发挥老工人的作用和开展多种多样的竞赛活动。
    张兆美（中国石油工会全国委员会主席）代表在发言中，列举了很多事例说明新的生产高潮的苗头已在石油工业企业中开始出现。他说，在这样一种新形势的面前，我们必须有明确的目标和要求，使它成为石油工业系统中深入开展增产节约的巨大力量。
    韩黎民（国营山东造纸总厂工会主席）代表和曹桂芳（国营西北第一纺织厂细纱工区工会小组长）代表，介绍了他们所在的工厂和小组根据勤俭建国、勤俭办企业的方针，开展社会主义竞赛和进行工会工作的经验。
    陈庆泉（安徽省工会联合会主席）代表在发言中说明工会组织发动职工支援农业生产的重要意义。他说，在支援农业生产上，工会组织的任务是：广泛地组织职工群众，学习和讨论“1956年到1967年的全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）”，加强工人和农民的联系，并在这一基础上组织群众制定支援农业生产计划。在一切生产和供应农民生产资料、生活资料的企业中，工会组织应当发动职工开展社会主义竞赛，以实际行动支援农业生产。还必须加强县镇工会工作的领导，使县镇工会工作密切围绕着发展农业生产来进行。
    贾洪奎（吉林肥料厂工会副主席）代表在发言中以吉林肥料厂的建成和生产情况，说明了工业支援农业的重大意义。
    赵西山（陕西省延安县工会主席）代表在发言中介绍了延安的职工过去怎样一贯地发扬艰苦朴素和勤俭办企业的精神。他特别介绍了延安的丰足火柴厂。
    辛广义（青岛市工会联合会主席）代表在发言中说，在我国建设时期随着国民经济的发展，国家投资举办了许多福利事业，显著改善了职工生活。但由于职工生活问题是多方面的，特别是在我国目前的经济条件下，许多生活福利问题还不可能一下子解决。因此教育和组织职工运用自己力量来解决自己可以解决的问题，是工会组织的一项重要工作。
    上海港务局码头工人、先进生产者吴良先代表，在发言中也介绍了他们运用群众力量克服群众困难的办法。他们的基层工会建立了职工家属死亡互助会，互助条例中规定如有一名职工直系家属死亡，每一会员出两分钱，以他们的装卸区三千四百人计算，有家属死亡的职工可得六十八元，解决了很大的问题，但对拿出两分钱的每个人来讲，并没有什么影响，而且可以增进职工间的团结友爱。
    王瑛璞（北京市工会联合会副秘书长）代表在发言中介绍了北京市工会组织举办家属托儿站的情况。他说，托儿站有很多好处，花钱少，解决问题多，有群众的积极支援和爱护，容易办好。
    王榕（中华全国总工会工资部部长）代表在发言中着重在工会工资工作问题上发表了意见。他说，随着我国国民经济的巨大发展，职工工资水平的提高和工资总额的增长是相当快的。今年全国职工的平均工资预计要比1952年提高42.8％，工资总额预计要比1952年增长一点二倍。我国职工的生活，现在不仅比解放前有了很大的改善，而且绝大多数职工的工资比抗战以前也有了相当的提高。但是，目前工资工作中还存在不少问题。在这次整风中，职工对工资工作提出了许多批评和意见。意见中主要不在于工资水平的高低，而是各类人员之间的工资关系不够合理，有些工资制度不够实际，计件定额有偏松偏紧的现象，奖励工资制度有些混乱等等，通过这次整风，我们要努力克服这些缺点，改进工作。王榕还指出，宣传党和国家的工资政策，加强思想政治教育工作，提高职工的觉悟，并且在职工觉悟提高的基础上，正确地处理工资问题，这是工会经常的重要任务之一。忽视工资的物质鼓励作用是不对的，但是过多地强调物质鼓励作用，放松对职工的思想政治工作，就会助长职工的个人主义、本位主义和平均主义思想。对职工有关工资问题的申诉和要求，工会必须分别情况，认真对待。工会组织应该不嫌烦琐、不分巨细，做到事事有交代，件件有着落。王榕还强调说，工会必须向全体工会干部和广大职工群众，宣传解释一切要从六亿人口出发，从发展生产出发，从巩固工农联盟出发，正确地对待工资和生产的关系。
    在大会上发言的，还有韦锡琢（长春第一汽车制造厂工会主席）崔东铉（延边朝鲜族自治州工会联合会副主席）代表等。
    明天，大会将继续举行。
    新华社6日讯　在工会第八次全国代表大会今天举行的全体会议上，有十一位来自亚洲、非洲、欧洲地区的工会代表在会上致词。他们向大会表达了热烈的祝贺，并强调提出各国工人阶级要进一步加强相互之间的联系和团结。
    印度尼西亚共和国中央职工会副总书记哈沁·达利夫在祝词中，着重谈到了印度尼西亚人民为解放西伊里安进行的斗争。他说，为了这一斗争，现在印度尼西亚工人已经进行了第二阶段的行动，在所有的荷兰企业中进行了连续二十四小时的罢工。哈沁·达利夫相信印度尼西亚人民在这一斗争中，必将得到中国工人和全世界工人的支援，他说，你们的支援一定会增强反对殖民主义和保卫世界和平的共同斗争精神。在他致词结束的时候，全场响起了热烈的掌声，大会执行主席表示，中国工人阶级将始终不渝地支持印度尼西亚人民收复西伊里安的正义斗争。
    伊朗工人和劳动人民工会中央联合会总书记礼萨·鲁斯塔致词。他说，虽然伊朗全体人民都要求和中国建立邦交，但伊朗统治集团听从美国帝国主义的指示，至今还不承认中华人民共和国。伊朗谚语说得好：“蝙蝠虽不愿见太阳，但太阳的价值和用处并不因此而逊色。”他相信在不久的将来，在从波斯湾直到里海的人民群众的压力下，伊朗政府是会被迫承认中国的。他的致词受到了全体代表的热烈欢迎。
    日本工会总评议会副议长藤冈三男代表总评的三百五十万会员向大会致热烈的祝贺。他说，我们注视着中国社会主义的发展，并且愿意从中吸取各种经验。藤冈三男在指出中日两国工人的互相往来已经有了发展之后说，我们相信，日本工人和人民的斗争，成为巨大的力量，必将迫使日本政府恢复中、日邦交。
    全日本产业别工会会议议长市川福平致词说，不仅日本工人，而且亚洲、阿拉伯以及全世界的工人都很关心你们的大会，并且预祝大会成功。他表示相信中国工人阶级一定能够把中国建成一个伟大的繁荣富强的社会主义国家。
    日本全国产业别工会联合会代表佐藤乐造在祝词中，对中国伟大的社会主义建设和工会的成就表示敬佩。他说，如果中日两国工人的频繁往来继续下去，那么这次没有和我们一起来参加大会的其他日本工会团体，不久也将会开辟同中国工会友好的道路。佐藤乐造说，中日两国工人之间的联系，必将成为推动两国恢复邦交和和平发展的力量。
    来自日本的这三个工会组织的代表在致词后都分别向大会赠送了礼品，大会执行主席分别向他们表示感谢，并且说，中日两国工人和人民的友好团结和互相支援，一定能够在反对原子弹与氢弹的制造和试验中，在争取亚洲和世界和平的斗争中，作出卓越的贡献。
    朝鲜职业同盟中央委员会委员长韩相斗在致词中，代表朝鲜工人阶级向在战争时期和战后时期积极援助朝鲜的中国工人阶级和全体中国人民表示谢意。他说，朝中两国人民的友谊有着悠久的历史，两国人民的英勇斗争和友好关系，不仅对亚洲及世界和平作出了巨大的贡献，而且已经成为充分发扬和表现崇高的无产阶级国际主义和高尚道德品质的榜样。韩相斗说，现在美帝国主义者和李承晚正在违反停战协定，企图在朝鲜重新挑起战争。但是，不管美帝国主义怎样无视朝鲜人民的愿望，它们的侵略阴谋一定要破产，朝鲜的和平统一一定能够实现。韩相斗致词后向大会赠送了锦旗和礼品。
    毛里求斯农业工会代表巴雷德在致词中表示他们能到中国来感到很荣幸。他说，我们同还受着帝国主义束缚的其他被压迫的落后国家一样，也从中国、苏联及其他人民民主国家那里找到了鼓舞自己、进行争取政治和经济解放斗争的力量。
    蒙古工会中央理事会主席德·巴拉吉尼姆代表蒙古工会向中国工会和工人阶级热烈致意。他在祝词中说，中国工人阶级同全体人民一起，在社会主义建设方面已经获得了巨大的成就。这些事实向全世界证明了社会主义制度的无比的优越性。由于伟大的邻邦苏联和中国对蒙古的兄弟般的无私援助，蒙古人民共和国最近几年在发展自己的经济和文化方面获得了巨大的进展。蒙古人民对于中国给予我们的无私帮助感到无限欢欣。我们的任务是要继续发展和巩固这种友谊和联系。巴拉吉尼姆致词后，向大会赠送了锦旗和影片，瓷器等礼物。
    波兰工会中央理事会代表波莱斯拉夫·吉伯特致词说，波兰人民对于英勇的中国工人阶级和中国人民，怀着诚挚的和兄弟般的同情和友谊。我们对于伟大的中国人民在巩固世界和平事业上和开辟世界社会进步的道路上所起的作用，有着极高的评价。波兰人民和全体工人阶级，都特别重视同中国工会的越来越密切的合作。吉伯特致词后把模仿华沙的城徽塑造的一座美人鱼的塑像送给了大会。
    罗马尼亚工会中央理事会书记巴斯库·尼古拉致词说，中国人民在建设社会主义道路上所取得的成就，巩固和提高了中华人民共和国作为一个大国的国际地位和影响。罗中两国有着建设社会主义的共同目标和巩固和平的共同意志，这些共同的东西使我们两国人民和工会组织永远紧密地团结在一起。尼古拉致词后也向大会赠送了礼品。
    越南总工会主席黄国越在致词中转达了越南总工会和越南全体劳动人民对大会的祝贺。他说，中国人民在以毛主席为首的中国共产党领导下进行的反帝斗争和今天的社会主义改革和社会主义建设所取得的创造性的非凡成就，使得战无不胜的社会主义思想更加光辉，使正在进行反对殖民主义、反对帝国主义好战分子的各国人民更加充满了斗争信心。越南人民和越南工会，一向把中国劳动人民和中国革命运动，看作是他们的榜样。他表示今后要进一步加强两国人民的亲密团结。黄国越致词后，向大会献旗和赠送了礼物。
    大会副秘书长陈用文在今天的会议上向大会宣读了意大利总工会致大会的贺信。由意大利总工会书记处书记桑蒂和拉马签名的贺信说，意大利总工会由于它的总书记维多里奥同志的突然逝世而面临着一些困难而急迫的问题，因此只能向大会发出这封贺信。贺信说，我们知道中国工人阶级和中国人民不仅完成和超额完成了第一个五年计划，而且已在准备去实现更加远大的计划。意大利劳动者确信有一天他们也将走上你们的同样道路。
