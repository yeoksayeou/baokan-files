　　What is a Cold Wave?

    People often see "Cold Wave Warning" messages issued by the meteorological observatory in the newspaper. What exactly is a cold wave?
    Simply put, a cold wave is cold air coming from the north. The standard for the meteorological observatory to issue a "Cold Wave Warning" is: the temperature drops sharply by more than 10 degrees Celsius within a day, and the minimum temperature drops to below 5°C.
    How exactly are cold waves formed?
    The Siberian and Mongolian Plateaus, located in the north and northwest of China, are right in the center of the world's largest continent—Eurasia. They are located at higher latitudes and geographically belong to the frigid zone, so sunlight cannot directly reach these places. Due to the oblique incidence of the sun, the ground heats up less and for a shorter period during the day, while the ground radiates heat more and for a longer period at night. In addition, these places are far from the ocean, making it difficult to be affected by oceanic regulation, so the temperature is very low and the climate is very cold. For example, Verkhoyansk, the world's cold pole, has recorded a minimum temperature of minus 68°C.
    Air also has the characteristics of thermal expansion and contraction. Cold air shrinks in volume and increases in density, making it easier to sink. When more and more cold air sinks here, the pressure increases. When the force reaches a certain level, the cold air will flow along the ground to the surrounding areas where the density is lower and there is less air. This is what is called a "cold wave outbreak." The area where the cold air is most concentrated and the force is strongest is what we call the "cold wave path."
    Cold waves move southward and invade China, roughly dividing into three paths from west to east:
    The first path originates in Siberia or even further regions of the Soviet Union, and invades China from the northwest through Xinjiang. This route of cold wave invades China more frequently, affects a wider area, and can reach the southern provinces when its strength is strong.
    The second path invades China via the People's Republic of Mongolia. It originates in Siberia or the People's Republic of Mongolia. Because this cold wave source is close to China, and the terrain along the way happens to be high in the north and low in the south, the cold wave force is very strong. It rushes directly into China from north to south, and after reaching the Yellow River and Huai River basins via the North China Plain, it often spreads out in a fan shape, affecting a wide range, and can reach Jiangxi, Zhejiang and other provinces, and even the Nanling Mountains when its strength is strong. This cold wave often brings strong winds of level 6-7 or above, and the temperature can drop by more than 10°-20° within a day; the early and late frost damage in spring and autumn is often caused by it.
    The third path often invades China from the northeast. It generally originates on the Sea of Okhotsk in the Soviet Union, and its strength is weaker and the number of times is not large, so it has little impact on China.
    When a cold wave breaks out, it is often accompanied by strong winds, low temperatures, frost and blizzards, which have a great impact on people's production and life. If preventive work is done in a timely manner, unexpected disasters can be avoided or reduced.

　　寒潮是怎么回事

    人们常从报纸上看到气象台发布的“寒潮警报”消息。寒潮到底是怎样一回事呢？
    简单说来，寒潮就是从北方来的寒冷空气。气象台发布“寒潮警报”的标准是：一天之内，气温急剧下降摄氏十度以上，而最低气温又降至5℃以下。
    寒潮究竟怎样形成的呢？
    位于我国北方和西北方的西伯利亚和蒙古高原，正当世界上最大的大陆——欧亚大陆的中心，纬度较高，在地理上属于寒带，太阳光不能直射到这些地方。由于太阳的斜射，白天地面受热既短且少，而夜晚地面散热既长又多。再加上这些地方离海洋很远，很难受到海洋的调剂，所以温度非常低，气候也是非常冷的。譬如世界寒极——维尔霍扬斯克，最低温度曾达零下68℃。
    空气也有热胀冷缩的特性。冷空气体积缩小，密度变大，因而易于下沉。当这里冷空气愈沉愈多，压力也就增大，等到势力达到一定程度时，冷空气就要沿着地面向四周密度比较小、空气比它少的地方流去，这就是所谓“寒潮爆发”。其中冷空气最集中，势力最强的地方，就是我们所说的“寒潮路径”。
    寒潮南下侵入我国，自西向东大致可以分为三条路径：
    第一条路径，发源于苏联的西伯利亚甚至更远的地区，经过新疆从西北方向侵入我国。这路寒潮侵入我国的次数比较多，影响的地区也比较宽广，势力强盛时可达华南各省。
    第二条路径是经由蒙古人民共和国侵入我国的。它发源于西伯利亚或蒙古人民共和国。由于这路寒潮源地离我国近，而且沿途所经地势也恰好是北面高、南面低，所以寒潮势力非常强大。由北向南直接冲入我国，经华北平原到黄河、淮河流域之后，常成扇形形式展开，影响范围亦颇宽广，势力强盛时可达江、浙等省，甚至南岭山地。这路寒潮常刮六—七级以上的大风，一日内温度可降10°—20°以上；春、秋季的早、晚霜害也常常是它造成的。
    第三条路径常从东北方向侵入我国。它一般都发源于苏联的鄂霍次克海面上，势力较弱，次数也不多，所以对我国的影响不大。
    寒潮爆发时，常伴有大风、低温、霜冻和暴风雪，它对人们的生产和生活都有很大影响。如果及时做好预防工作，意外灾害是可以避免或减轻的。
