Accounting Clearly and Distinguishing Right from Wrong: Starting from 600 Million People
Shijingshan Power Plant Cancels Unreasonable Welfare Benefits

(Reported by this newspaper) After nearly two months of debate among the workers of the Shijingshan Power Plant in Beijing regarding the plant’s violation of state economic regulations in terms of employee welfare, they unanimously agreed to implement state regulations starting from November. This includes collecting rent, water fees, and furniture fees according to state standards, canceling housing subsidies and haircut allowances, and charging for family medical treatment as stipulated.

Big-Character Posters Raise Serious Criticisms, Some Agree, Some Disagree

Before November, the welfare standards for employees of the Shijingshan Power Plant mostly exceeded the standards stipulated by the state. For example, in violation of labor insurance regulations, the plant stipulated that all medical, surgical, and laboratory fees for direct family members of employees treated at the plant's clinic were completely free. When treated at designated hospitals, half of the cost of ordinary medicines, expensive medicines, hospitalization, surgery, and treatment was borne by the individual, while the other half and all other expenses were covered by the public. This item alone cost the state an extra 20,000 yuan per year. After the wage reform last year, the state stipulated that employees living in public housing should pay monthly rent, water fees, and furniture fees, but this plant did not collect these fees. Instead, it provided a monthly housing subsidy of 2.97 yuan to those living in private housing. The plant also issued a haircut allowance of 0.25 yuan to each employee per month.

Many employees were unaware of these circumstances. On September 20, an employee with the pseudonym "Jing Li" comprehensively exposed these issues in a big-character poster titled "State Regulations Should Be Implemented," and questioned the leading cadres: "What attitude do you have towards state regulations?" "Is economicism at play?" On September 23, Party Secretary Li Ximing explained to Party members and all employees the reasons for violating state economic regulations, initially examined and criticized economicism in leadership, and expressed his intention to immediately correct this mistake and act in accordance with state regulations. Party branches in each workshop also invited workers to discussions. Many employees supported Li Ximing's speech, advocating for the immediate implementation of state economic regulations, reducing what should be reduced, canceling what should be canceled, and not continuing to make mistakes. The employee representative assembly held from September 25 to 27, after careful discussion, also agreed to implement state regulations regarding the collection of rent, water fees, and the cancellation of haircut allowances.

However, when the decision of the employee representative assembly was disseminated among all employees, many employees could not understand it. Some said, "Workers create wealth for the country through production, why should they pay rent for housing?" Some said, "During the Japanese and Kuomintang rule, there was no rent collection, why are they collecting rent now?" Some said, "During the rectification campaign, workers should get more money and more welfare. Now, not only are we not getting more, but we are also getting less. This means the state wants to separate from the workers, which will affect the workers' enthusiasm for production."

Clear Accounting of Six Detailed Accounts, Workers Distinguish Right from Wrong

To help all employees understand the necessity of implementing state regulations, the plant calculated six detailed accounts for the employees in mid-October. The first was how many dormitories the state had built for the plant's employees in recent years and how much money was spent. The result was that more than 25,000 square meters were built, costing 1,400,080 yuan. More than 96% of the plant's employees lived in public housing. On average, each household with family members occupied 27 square meters, and each single employee occupied 7 square meters. The second was how much money the state spent each year on taxes, insurance, and maintenance for the houses occupied by employees. The result was more than 50,000 yuan, of which maintenance fees accounted for 30,000 yuan. If the houses could be lived in for 30 years, then the state's expenditure in these areas would almost equal the investment in building the houses. The third was comparing the money spent by the state on the plant's employee housing each year since liberation with the state's construction investment this year. The result of the comparison was that the state's construction investment this year, spread across the entire population, averaged only 16 yuan per person, while the expenses spent by the state on the plant's employee housing over the years averaged 1,600 yuan per person. The fourth was calculating how much more money the state spent each year because the plant's employees' families were not charged according to regulations for medical treatment. The result was that in 1956 alone, more than 24,000 yuan was spent. The fifth was calculating whether the current rent standard was high. The result was that it only accounted for a little more than 2% of the employee's income on average. The sixth was calculating the expenditure on welfare expenses. The result was that in addition to paying employees' salaries and bonuses, the state spent an average of more than 300 yuan per employee each year on labor insurance and welfare. The plant's welfare expenses were over budget every year. After canceling unreasonable welfare benefits in the future, it would only be possible to achieve a basic balance of income and expenditure.

After hearing these six accounts, the employees felt that they were truly unaware of their blessings. Many people said that if they had known in the past how much money the state spent on the living and welfare of each of us, there would not have been so many objections to canceling unreasonable welfare benefits. Many people said that they had to pay taxes and repairs for their own houses, and rent for private housing. It was completely appropriate to pay some rent for public housing. Some people said that their living expenses should be paid from their salaries. If they asked the state to cover everything, where would the state get the money for socialist construction? From these detailed accounts, everyone saw that the state's regulations took into account both the immediate interests of the working class and the long-term interests of the working class. Only by resolutely implementing state regulations could each worker be worthy of being a leading class.

Old Workers Compare Life in the Old and New Societies, New Workers Feel Happy with Today's Life

During the debate about why rent was not collected during the Japanese and Kuomintang rule, but now rent is collected, the old workers all said that the Japanese and Kuomintang did not give workers houses to live in at all. Why would they collect rent from the workers? Old workers Qin Longhai, Ma Ming, and Yu Jingwu all said that the Japanese built a few houses, but they were for Japanese employees and foremen to live in. Workers were not even allowed to enter. The Kuomintang only built blockhouses, and even building two toilets required workers to share the expenses on a per capita basis, two jiao per person, even those who did not live here had to pay. At that time, some workers lived in donkey sheds, which leaked rain in the summer and let in wind in the winter, so cold that they couldn't sleep. Some people dug small earthen kilns to live in, and they worried about them collapsing when it rained, and they were worried day and night, afraid of being crushed to death. Some people rented private houses, a mud house with drafts of wind cost one bag of flour a month for rent, and they had to pay a deposit of three months or half a year in advance, and they also had to endure the landlord's anger. Now, when they hear about rent collection, they say that rent was not collected in the past, but what kind of houses did they live in before, and what kind of houses do they live in now? What kind of life did they live before, and what kind of life do they live now? The state cares for us workers so much, who says the state wants to separate from the workers? Many young workers became clear-headed after listening to the old workers' recollections and comparisons, saying: Where did we know that workers suffered this kind of hardship in the past? Living today is truly happy.

Visiting the Countryside and Local Small Factories, Looking at Problems from the Perspective of 600 Million People

During the process of carrying out discussions among the masses of employees, the factory also organized workers to visit the countryside, the Jingxi Coal Mine, several small and medium-sized local state-owned factories, and joint state-private factories. This was very helpful in helping workers consider problems from the perspective of 600 million people. Old worker Jia Wannian from the boiler shop said: "It is often said that workers and peasants are like close brothers. If the older brother always eats well and drinks well, the younger brother will not be of one mind with you. Only if the older brother endures hardship first and enjoys later will the younger brother look up to you. However, some of our workers don't look like older brothers at all. Not to mention comparing with the peasants' spirit of hard work and arduous struggle, enduring hardship, even if we are asked to pay a little rent and water fees today, some people have objections. Don't you repair your own house when it is damaged? Even if you drink well water, you still have to buy ropes and buckets several times a year. Why shouldn't you pay for tap water? Especially some young people, they are always dissatisfied in this society, competing for wages and bonuses. It seems that we must fundamentally dig out the roots of this hedonism from the ideological aspect!"

Through in-depth discussions, the employees all realized that they should look at welfare issues from the perspective of 600 million people, and that they should be diligent and thrifty to ensure that the state can take out more funds for socialist construction. The broad masses of employees all happily agreed to cancel unreasonable welfare benefits.

To ensure that the living standards of old workers are not lowered, the factory leadership is currently studying specific measures.

### 算细账明是非　从六亿人口出发  石景山发电厂取消不合理的福利待遇

    算细账明是非　从六亿人口出发
    石景山发电厂取消不合理的福利待遇
    本报讯　北京石景山发电厂职工，就该厂在职工生活福利方面违反国家经济制度的问题展开了将近两个月的辩论以后，一致同意从11月份起执行国家制度，按照国家制度收房租、水费、家具费，取消房贴、理发津贴，家属治病照规定收费。
    大字报提出严正批评  有人赞成　有人反对
    11月以前，石景山发电厂的职工生活福利标准，大都超过国家规定的标准。如违反劳动保险条例，规定职工直系供养亲属在本厂医务室看病诊治的医药费、手术费、化验费等全部免费；在特约医院诊治时，普通药费、贵重药费、住院费、手术费、处理费由本人负担一半，其余一半和其他一切费用都由公家负担。仅这一项每年国家就多支出二万元左右。去年工资改革以后，国家规定住公家房子的职工一律按月收房租、水费和家具费，但这个厂都没有收，对住私人房子的人每月还发给房贴二元九角七分钱。这个厂每月还发给每个职工理发津贴二角五分。
    以上这些情况，许多职工是不知道的。9月20日，一位署名“景理”的职工在一张以“应该执行国家规定”为题的大字报上，全面揭发了这些问题，并质问领导干部：“以什么态度对待国家制度？”“是不是经济主义思想在作祟呢？”9月23日，党委书记李锡铭分别对党员和全体职工说明造成违反国家经济制度的原因，初步检查和批判了领导上的经济主义思想，并表示马上纠正这个错误，按照国家制度办事。各车间党的支部也邀请工人座谈。许多职工拥护李锡铭的讲话，主张立即执行国家经济制度，该减的就减，该取消的就取消，不要一错再错下去。从9月25日到27日举行的职工代表大会，经过认真讨论以后，也同意执行国家关于收房租、水费和取消理发津贴等制度。
    但是，当职工代表大会的决定在全体职工中传开时，不少职工想不通。有的人说：“工人生产是给国家创造财富，为什么住房子还要收房租？”有的说：“日本和国民党统治时代没有收房租，为什么现在收起房租来了？”有的说：“在整风中应该给工人增点钱，增点福利，现在不但不增，还要减少，这是国家要和工人分家，会影响工人的生产积极性。”
    算清六笔细账　工人辨明是非
    为了帮助全体职工都认识执行国家制度的必要，厂里在10月中旬给职工们算了六笔细账。一笔是几年来国家给本厂职工盖了多少宿舍，花了多少钱。算的结果是：一共盖了二万五千多平方公尺，花了一百四十万零八千元。全厂96％以上的职工住上了公家房。有家属的平均每户占房二十七平方公尺，单身职工每人平均占七平方公尺。二是算职工住了房子，国家每年花多少钱来纳税、保险和维护。算的结果是花了五万多元，其中维护费占三万元。假使房子能住三十年的话，那末国家在这些方面的开支几乎等于盖房的投资。三是把解放以来国家每年花在本厂职工住房上的钱和国家今年的建设投资作比较。比较的结果是：今年国家的建设投资，摊在全国人民身上，每人平均不过十六元，而历年来国家用在本厂职工住房上面的费用，每人平均摊得一千六百元。四是算由于本厂职工家属治病没有按照规定收费，国家每年多花多少钱。算的结果是仅1956年多花二万四千元。五是算目前房租标准高不高。算的结果是：平均只占职工收入的2％多一点。六是算福利费的开支。算的结果是：国家除发给职工工资、奖励外，每年平均为每个职工所花的劳保福利费达三百多元，厂里每年福利费都超支，今后取消不合理的福利以后，也只能做到基本上收支平衡。
    职工们听了这六笔账，觉得真是身在福中不知福。许多人都说，要是过去知道国家为我们每一个人的生活福利花这么多钱，对取消不合理的福利待遇，那里还有这么多意见。许多人说，住自己房要交税，要维修，租私人房住也要交房租，住公家房拿点房租完全应该。有些人说：自己的生活费用应该从工资中支出，要求国家包下来，国家哪里还有钱来进行社会主义建设？大家从这些细账中看到：国家的规定都是既照顾工人阶级的眼前利益，又考虑到工人阶级的长远利益，每个工人只有坚决执行国家规定，才不愧为领导阶级。
    老工人对比新旧社会生活  新工人感到今天生活幸福
    在辩论到日本和国民党统治时期不收房租，为什么现在收房租的时候，老工人们都说：日本人和国民党根本没给工人房子住，他们凭什么向工人收房租呢？老工人秦龙海、马明和于京武都说，日本人盖过几间房子，都是给日本职员和工头住的，工人连进都不许进去。国民党尽盖炮楼，盖两间厕所还要工人按人头摊钱，一人二角，不住在这里的也得出。那时候，工人们有的住驴棚子，夏天漏雨，冬天透风，冷得睡不着。有的人自己挖个小土窑住，下雨时就耽心塌下来，黑夜白天都提心吊胆，生怕砸死人。有的人租私人房住，一间透风的土坯房，一月一袋白面房租，还得先交三个月或半年的押金，还要受房东的气。现在听说收房租，就说过去不收房租，可是以前住的是什么房子，现在住的是什么房子；以前过的是什么生活，现在过的又是什么生活？国家对我们工人这样关心，谁说国家要和工人分家？许多青年工人听了老工人的回忆对比，头脑清醒起来了，说：我们哪里知道过去工人受这份罪？生活在今天真是幸福。
    参观农村和地方小工厂  从六亿人口出发看问题
    在职工群众开展辩论的过程中，工厂还先后组织了工人访问农村，访问京西煤矿、几个中小型地方国营工厂和公私合营工厂。这对帮助工人们从六亿人口出发考虑问题很有好处。锅炉场老工人贾万年说：“常常说工人农民如同亲哥俩，如果哥哥老是吃好的，喝好的，做兄弟的就不和你一条心了。做哥哥的只有吃苦在先，享受在后，弟弟才看得上你。可是，我们有些工人没有一点做哥哥的样子。不要说比农民的艰苦奋斗，吃苦耐劳的精神，就是今天让我们拿点房租、水费，有些人就有意见了。难道你住自己的房子，房子坏了就不修理了吗？就是吃井水，一年还得买几回绳子和水桶呢，吃自来水为什么不该拿钱呢？尤其是有些青年人，在这社会里老是不知足，争工资，争奖励。看来，总得从思想上挖掉这个享乐的根子才行！”
    通过深入的讨论，职工们都认识到应该从六亿人口出发来看待生活福利问题，应该勤俭节约，保证国家能拿出更多的资金进行社会主义建设。广大职工都愉快地同意取消不合理的福利待遇。
    为了保证老工人的生活水平不降低，现在，工厂领导方面正在研究具体的办法。
