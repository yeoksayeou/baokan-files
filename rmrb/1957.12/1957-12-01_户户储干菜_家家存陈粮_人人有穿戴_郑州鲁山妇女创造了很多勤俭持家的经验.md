Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 29th: Five hundred model housekeepers from the Zhengzhou suburbs—rural housewives—met from the 16th to the 19th and summarized dozens of experiences in saving grain. Because they are meticulous in their use of grain, every household now stores dried vegetables, and every family has surplus grain.

Many of the grain-saving experiences introduced at the meeting are time-honored golden rules passed down in the countryside. They said that noodles should be "rolled thinly and cut finely," so that the same amount of flour can produce more noodles. They also said, "Steaming buns saves, grilling buns costs, to eat pot cakes, sell the land." The housewives also introduced more than a dozen ways to eat wild vegetables. Bai Xiufeng of Miaowang Village washes sweet potato stalks and other things, dries them, grinds them finely, and mixes them with some sweet persimmons to make three kinds of sweet cakes without using any grain, which children love to eat. Now people throughout the village have adopted her method.

Women in the Zhengzhou suburbs have generally developed the habit of weighing grain before eating it. Song Da Niang of Nie Village has more than 20 people in her family. For several years, she has weighed the grain she uses every day, so she has never experienced a grain shortage, and she even has a small surplus. Fifteen women in H塞乡 have saved 4,000 jin of grain in the past year by insisting on weighing their grain.

According to Xinhua News Agency, 29th: Four hundred women from Lushan County, Henan Province, who have done a good job in thrift and housekeeping, recently held a forum to discuss the benefits of thrift and housekeeping and how to be thrifty and manage the household.

The information provided at the forum showed that thrift and housekeeping are of great benefit to the country, the agricultural cooperative, and oneself. Wei Naixiang, an old woman from Chengguan Town, supports her family of four entirely by mending clothes for others. Her family eats sparingly and uses frugally. They not only eat their fill and dress warmly, but also save 145 jin of grain to sell to the state. He Rui's family in Zhangliang Township pays attention to thrift. Taking saving cotton cloth as an example, since the state implemented the rationed supply of cotton cloth, her family has only used three chi of cloth coupons. Because the work of thrift and housekeeping has been carried out well in Malou Township, from October last year to the end of August this year, the sideline income of the township's cooperative members' families reached more than 2.76 million yuan, they raised more than 3,300 pigs, and saved more than 264,000 jin of grain, more than 33,000 chi of cotton cloth, and more than 30,000 jin of feed. Because of increased income and surplus grain and money, all of the original 2,000 grain-deficient households in the township's ten cooperatives have become self-sufficient or surplus households this year. The township has repaid more than 22,000 yuan in state loans and saved more than 3,900 yuan.

The situation at the forum also showed that developing diverse household sideline production is an important part of thrift and housekeeping. According to statistics, the women attending the forum raised a total of 565 pigs, more than 3,900 chickens, and 1,982 Angora rabbits. Household sideline income generally accounts for one-third to one-half of the family's total income.

　　郑州鲁山妇女创造了很多勤俭持家的经验
    据新华社郑州29日电　郑州市郊区的五百名勤俭持家能手——农村家庭主妇16日到19日开会，总结出了几十种节约用粮的经验。她们因为在用粮上精打细算，现在都户户储干菜，家家有陈粮。
    会上介绍的各种节约粮食的经验，有不少是长期流传在农村中的金玉良言。她们说，面条要“薄扞细切”，这样同样多的面粉可以多出面条。她们还说，“蒸馍省，烙馍费，要吃锅饼卖了地”。主妇们还介绍了十几种吃野菜的方法。庙王村的白秀峰把红薯秆等洗净、晒干、磨细，分别掺些甜柿子，不用一点粮食，可以做出三种甜饼，孩子们最喜欢吃。现在全村的人家都采用了她的这个办法。
    郑州市郊区的妇女普遍养成了吃粮上秤的习惯。聂庄有位宋大娘家，共有二十多口人。几年来她家每天用的粮都用秤称好，因此从未闹过粮荒，而且还有少量节余。候塞乡的十五位妇女，一年来由于坚持吃粮上秤，节约了四千斤粮食。
    据新华社29日讯　河南省鲁山县四百名勤俭持家做得好的妇女不久前举行座谈会，讨论了勤俭持家的好处和怎样来勤俭持家等问题。
    座谈会上提供的情况说明，勤俭持家对国家、对农业社、对自己都有极大的好处。城关镇老大娘卫乃香一家四口全靠她替人缝补衣裳过活，全家省吃俭用，不但吃得饱、穿得暖，还节省了一百四十五斤粮食卖给国家。张良乡何瑞家注意节俭，单以节约棉布来说，从国家实行棉布定量供应以来，她全家只用过三尺布票。马楼乡因为勤俭持家工作开展得好，去年10月到今年8月底全乡社员家庭副业收入达二百七十六万多元，养猪三千三百多头，节约粮食二十六万四千多斤，棉布三万三千多尺，饲料三万多斤。因为收入增加、粮钱有余，全乡十个社原来的二千多户缺粮户今年全部成为自足户或余粮户，全乡归还国家贷款二万二千多元，并储蓄三千九百多元。
    座谈会上的情况还表明，开展多种多样的家庭副业生产，是勤俭持家的重要内容。据统计，出席座谈会的全体妇女共养猪五百六十五只，鸡三千九百多只，安哥拉兔一千九百八十二只，家庭副业收入一般占全家总收入的三分之一到一半。
