Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Washington: Eisenhower returned to Washington on the 20th after attending the NATO summit in Paris. Upon arriving at the White House, he immediately began to implement the US government's military expansion plan.

That day, Eisenhower met with Budget Director Brundage to discuss how to increase military spending to manufacture new weapons.

United Press International reporter Dipley revealed in a report from Washington that senior US officials said: Eisenhower intends to request Congress to allocate funds for a "massive special program" to establish medium-range ballistic missile launch bases within the territory of four countries in the North Atlantic Group within eighteen months. According to the agreement already reached in Paris by the military leaders of the North Atlantic Group, these four countries will receive such missiles in the following order: Great Britain first, Turkey second, France third, and the Netherlands fourth.

Recently, the US ruling group has been instigating an anti-Soviet and war-preparation hysterical propaganda campaign domestically, and is promoting a plan to accelerate the nuclear arms race amidst this propaganda clamor.

According to the "New York Herald Tribune," Washington "some prominent figures, with the participation of US Vice President Nixon," held a special meeting. They used the Soviet Union's new achievements in science and technology to clamor about the so-called "Soviet threat." They demanded that the American people should "tighten their belts," "make sacrifices," and "shed blood, sweat, and tears" for the government's war preparations plan. The US government is increasing appropriations and concentrating its efforts on developing missiles and increasing nuclear weapons. The US government has ordered the acceleration of testing and "production" of medium-range missiles to deploy them on the territory of Western European countries. The Department of Defense also plans to allocate $2 billion to build a series of launch sites in the US mainland, specifically for launching long-range missiles. Senate Democratic Leader Johnson recently called for extending working hours and implementing a "full wartime mobilization schedule" to manufacture missiles. According to a spokesman for the US Army Corps of Engineers, the work of building new missile facilities in El Paso, New Mexico, and Texas has been accelerated into a "blitz" effort. Defense Secretary McElroy also said that the Department of Defense will request Congress to appropriate approximately $1 billion more in the current fiscal year, mainly for the development of missiles.

Conscription continues. The US Army Department announced that its conscription quota for January to June next year will increase. The reorganization of the army regarding the "five-unit atomic division" is also being accelerated.

Many American monopoly capitalists are extremely interested in this accelerated war preparation plan. They hope to use increased military spending to stimulate military production and to stem the current economic recession trend in the United States.

However, the American public is indifferent to this plan. A recent Gallup poll showed that the American people are currently most concerned about the poor domestic economic situation, racial discrimination issues, and maintaining international peace. Among those surveyed, only 7% felt "worried" about so-called "defense."

At the same time, according to the American press, the US government's war preparation plan itself has also encountered many other "tricky problems," including financial difficulties, "scientific and technological" problems, and so on.

A recent issue of "Newsweek" magazine said that a major problem with the missile program is "production technology." Defense Secretary McElroy admitted that neither the "Thor" nor the "Jupiter" missiles are currently "fully proven effective."

Regarding financial issues, Nixon recently said that the government will be willing to run a budget deficit to cope with military spending. This illustrates the US government's current financial difficulties and the further adverse effects that accelerating the nuclear arms race will bring to US finances.

The US government has announced that it is prepared to increase spending on the three armed forces and foreign "aid" by nearly $3 billion next year. Some newspapers estimate that the government's military appropriations request to Congress next year will increase by at least $5 billion compared to this year. This will further increase US government spending. From the 1955 fiscal year to the current 1958 fiscal year, the government's actual expenditures have been on a consistently rising straight line, from $68.1 billion to $79 billion. The actual expenditures of state and local governments have also been increasing at a rate of $3 billion per year during this period. Therefore, in the 1958 fiscal year, the expenditures of federal, state, and local governments combined will reach $121 billion, accounting for one-third of this year's total national income.

With such large expenditures, the US government is already heavily in debt. According to "Time" magazine, in mid-November of this year, the US federal government's debt had actually exceeded the maximum limit of $275 billion stipulated by Congress. In addition, the finances of US state and local governments are also in trouble now, and their debt amounted to $52.5 billion by the end of June of this year.

The US government's current tax revenue has reached an unprecedented high level. This year, federal, state, and local taxes are estimated to reach $119 billion, which is double the $60 billion in 1950. To further increase military spending, even more money will have to be taken from the people's pockets. According to a recent report in the "Wall Street Journal," many states in the United States now have organizations of taxpayers opposing high taxes. These organizations are demanding amendments to legislation to restrict the collection of new taxes and the increase of tax rates. They are also protesting against the inflation and high cost of living caused by the government's huge expenditures.

Some American newspapers pointed out that, especially since the American economy is currently in a recession, the heavy tax burden has further weakened the people's purchasing power, which will make economic activity even more difficult.

### 美国统治集团核军备竞赛狂热病发作  艾森豪威尔回国后立即布置扩军  但碰到了财政拮据和科学技术落后的难关

    美国统治集团核军备竞赛狂热病发作
    艾森豪威尔回国后立即布置扩军
    但碰到了财政拮据和科学技术落后的难关
    本报综合报道  据新华社讯：华盛顿消息：艾森豪威尔在出席巴黎北大西洋公约组织最高级会议后于20日返回华盛顿。他到达白宫后就立即着手推行美国政府的扩军计划。
    艾森豪威尔这一天会见了预算局长布伦戴奇，研究如何增加军事开支以制造新武器的问题。
    合众社记者迪普里从华盛顿发出的报道中透露，美国高级官员说：艾森豪威尔打算要求国会拨款实行一个“庞大的特别计划”，以便在十八个月之内在北大西洋集团里的四个国家境内建立中程弹道导弹的发射基地。按照北大西洋集团的军事首脑已经在巴黎达成协议，这四个国家将按照下列的次序获得这种导弹：英国第一，土耳其第二，法国第三，荷兰第四。
    最近以来，美国统治集团在国内煽动一个反苏和备战歇斯底里的宣传运动，并在这种宣传叫嚷声中推行着一个加紧核军备竞赛的计划。
    据“纽约先驱论坛报”报道，华盛顿“一些著名人士在美国副总统尼克松的参加下”举行了一个专门性的会议。用苏联科学技术的新成就来叫嚷所谓“苏联的威胁”。他们要求美国人民为了政府的备战计划应该“勒紧腰带”，“作出牺牲”，“流血、流汗、流泪”。美国政府正在增拨款项，集中力量于发展导弹和增加核武器的工作。美国政府已经命令加紧试验和“生产”中程导弹，以便把它们安置到西欧国家领土上去。国防部还计划拨出二十亿美元在美国本土建立一系列发射场，专门用来发射远程导弹。参议院民主党领袖约翰逊最近要求延长工作时间，实行一个“充分的战时动员时间表”来制造导弹。据美国工兵部队的发言人说，在新墨西哥州和得克萨斯州的厄尔巴索建造新的导弹设备的工作已经加紧成为一种“突击性”工作。国防部长麦克艾罗伊也说，国防部将要求国会在本财政年度再增拨约十亿美元，主要用来发展导弹。
    征兵在继续着。美国陆军部宣布，它在明年1月到6月的征兵额将要增加。军队关于“五单位制原子师”的整编工作也在加紧推行。
    美国许多垄断资本家对这种加紧备战计划极感兴趣。他们指望用增加军费来刺激军备生产，来拦挡美国目前的经济衰退趋向。
    但是，美国公众对这个计划却很冷淡。盖洛普民意测验所最近一次调查表明，美国人民目前最关心的是国内经济情况不佳、种族歧视问题以及维护国际和平问题。在被调查的人中对于所谓“防御”感到“忧虑”的只有7％。
    同时，据美国报刊说，美国政府的备战计划本身也遇到其他许多“棘手问题”，其中有财政困难问题、“科学技术”问题等等。
    12月间一期的“新闻周刊”说，导弹计划的一个大问题是“生产技术”。国防部长麦克艾罗伊承认，无论“雷神”式还是“丘辟特”式，目前都不是“完全证明有效”的导弹。
    在财政问题方面，尼克松曾经在最近说过，政府将不惜以预算出现赤字来应付军费开支。这已说明了美国政府目前的财政上的困难以及加紧核军备竞赛会给美国财政进一步带来恶果。
    美国政府已经宣布，准备在明年把三军开支和对外“援助”增加近三十亿美元。一些报刊估计，政府明年要求国会的军事拨款将比今年增加最少五十亿美元。这将使美国政府开支进一步增加。美国从1955财政年度到目前的1958财政年度，政府的实际支出已经一直是一条上升的直线，从六百八十一亿美元增加到七百九十亿美元。州和地方政府的实际支出在这个期间也每年以三十亿美元的速率向上增加。因此，在1958年度，联邦、州和地方政府的支出，已经将共达到一千二百一十亿美元，占今年的全部国民收入的三分之一。
    开支如此之大，美国政府目前已经高筑债台。据“时代”周刊说，今年11月中旬，美国联邦政府的债务实际上已经超过国会规定的二千七百五十亿美元的最高限额。此外，美国州和地方政府的财政现在也很困难，到今年6月底为止，它们的债务是五百二十五亿美元。
    美国政府目前的税收已经达到空前高的水平。今年，联邦、州和地方政府的捐税，估计要达一千一百九十亿美元，这比1950年的六百亿美元增加了一倍，再要增加军事开支，就要从人民的口袋中拿走更多的钱。据最近“华尔街日报”报道，现在美国有许多州都出现纳税人反对高额税收的组织，这些组织要求修改立法来限制征收新税和提高税率，它们还对政府的庞大开支所导致的通货膨胀和生活费用高涨提出抗议。
    美国有些报刊指出，特别是目前美国经济正处在衰退期中，沉重的税收负担更加削弱了人民的购买力，这将使经济活动更加遭遇困难。
