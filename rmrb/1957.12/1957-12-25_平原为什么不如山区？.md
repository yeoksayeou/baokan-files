Why are Plains Inferior to Mountains?
Zhou Zhenhua, First Secretary of the CPC Tangshan Prefectural Committee, Hebei Province

Tangshan Prefecture in Hebei Province is a region that is half plains and half mountains. The entire prefecture consists of ten counties: Le亭, Fengrun, Luanxian, Changli, and Yutian are five plain counties, while Zunhua, Funing, Lulong, Qian'an, and Qianxi are five mountain counties. Agricultural production is mainly grain. With the development of agricultural cooperativization, grain production has increased year by year. Since 1952, the average annual growth rate has been around 10%. If we exclude 1953, when severe floods caused a significant reduction in production, the average annual growth is 13%. This year, the entire prefecture experienced a general bumper harvest, with a grain yield of 367 jin per mu, an increase of 13.75% over last year and 55.11% over 1952. 90.36% of the cooperatives in the prefecture increased production compared to last year, and 77.2% of the cooperatives have caught up with or surpassed the production level of local well-to-do middle peasants.

However, the development of production is uneven across different regions of Tangshan Prefecture. The most significant manifestation of this is that mountainous areas are developing faster, while plains are developing slower. The five mountain counties increased from 238 jin per mu in 1952 to 386 jin per mu this year, an increase of 66%; the five plain counties increased from 241 jin per mu in 1952 to 354 jin per mu this year, an increase of 46.88%. The difference in development speed between mountainous and plain areas became even more pronounced after the establishment of advanced cooperatives. In 1956, the five mountain counties increased production by 19.62% compared to 1955, while the five plain counties only increased by 0.68%. This year, the mountain counties of Zunhua, Funing, and Lulong have already reached a yield of over 400 jin per mu, achieving the production targets for regions north of the Yellow River in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) ten years ahead of schedule. Only Leting County in the plains has achieved this target.

In terms of natural conditions, the plains are much more favorable than the mountains. Why is the increase in production faster in the mountains and slower in the plains? We can find the answer by comparing several measures that are critical to increasing production.

First, in terms of fertilization, the amount of fertilizer applied in the mountains is greater than in the plains. This is closely related to the number of pigs raised. According to statistics as of the end of October this year, the number of pigs raised in the five mountain counties increased from 454,875 in 1952 to 837,962 (excluding those sold to the state and slaughtered by the masses), an increase of 84.2%. The number of pigs raised in the five plain counties increased from 613,131 in 1952 to 761,199 (excluding those sold to the state and slaughtered by the masses), an increase of only 24.14%. Due to the large number of pigs raised in the mountains and the small number in the plains, there is a significant difference in the amount of fertilizer applied. In Zunhua, the number of pigs raised has developed to an average of four pigs per household, one pig for every 3.2 mu of land. The amount of fertilizer applied increased from less than 2,000 jin in 1951 to more than 6,000 jin in 1957. In Yutian County, the number of pigs raised is only slightly more than one per household, an average of one pig for every 11.7 mu of land. The amount of fertilizer applied is 2,000 to 3,000 jin. The amount of fertilizer applied plays a decisive role in the speed of production increase. For example, in Fanjialing, Zunhua, 86 pigs were raised in 1953, and much of the land was not fertilized. The fertilized land received a maximum of 2,000 jin, with an average yield of 160 jin per mu. This year, 836 pigs were raised, with an average of 1.5 pigs per person and one pig per mu of land. The amount of fertilizer applied was 8,000 jin per mu, and the yield increased to 445 jin per mu. The coastal areas of Fengrun and Luanxian and the low-lying areas of Yutian raise few pigs and do not even build toilets. Much of the land is not fertilized, and the fertilized land receives only about 1,000 jin, with a yield of only 100 to 200 jin.

Second, in terms of crop allocation, the proportion of high-yield crops (corn, sweet potatoes, rice, etc.) in the cultivated land area is larger in the mountains than in the plains. This year, the area of high-yield crops in the five mountain counties accounted for 54.07% of the total area of grain crops, and their yield accounted for 75.05% of the total output. In the five plain counties, the area of high-yield crops accounted for only 48.43% of the total area of grain crops, and their yield accounted for 70.19% of the total output. If the proportion of high-yield crops in the plains catches up with that of the mountains, it would increase grain production by 160 million jin.

Third, in terms of water conservancy construction, the mountains have developed better and more extensively than the plains. In the past two years, the area of irrigated land in the five mountain counties has expanded to 751,538 mu, accounting for 43.6% of the irrigable land area. In the five plain counties, it has expanded to 1,072,355 mu, accounting for only 24% of the irrigable land area. At the same time, the mountainous areas have vigorously carried out soil and water conservation work in recent years, controlling a watershed area of more than 600 square kilometers. This is also an important factor in promoting rapid production development. For example, Jianming Cooperative in Xisishilipu Township, Zunhua County, has actively built water conservancy projects in recent years, turning all dry land that can be irrigated into irrigated land. It has also built soil and water conservation projects, protecting more than 1,000 mu of land from mountain floods and ensuring bumper harvests year after year. Last year, the average grain yield was 440 jin per mu, and this year it has increased to 517 jin, five times higher than before the establishment of the cooperative.

Why have the mountains done better than the plains in several key measures to increase production? Of course, in addition to suffering from class oppression in history, the people in the mountainous areas have also suffered from deep natural disasters. Therefore, their revolutionary spirit of hard struggle and fighting against nature is relatively easy to promote. At the same time, the mountainous areas of Tangshan Prefecture are mostly old liberated areas. Under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government for many years, the people here have accumulated a lot of experience in fighting against nature. However, the fundamental reason why production in the plains is not as good as in the mountains lies in the leadership.

In terms of leadership ideology, the facts of the past few years have proven that the leadership ideology of Zunhua, Funing, Lulong and other counties is correct. Therefore, the leading cadres have determination and魄力 (pòlì - boldness, resolution), can tap the potential in light of local conditions, and can humbly learn from the experience of other places. However, some leading cadres in Fengrun and other counties have varying degrees of right-leaning conservative thinking. They cannot see the favorable conditions in their regions, one-sidedly emphasize difficult conditions, and even more cannot see the new situation after cooperativization. They stick to conventions, are content with the status quo, and believe that historical routines cannot be broken. They only look back and not forward in everything. In this way, they naturally cannot actively tap the potential for increased production. They often hold a skeptical and negative attitude towards the achievements and experience of other places, and even harbor jealousy, let alone humbly learn and study creatively. When formulating production plans, they do not admit the possibility of realization. When verifying the actual output, they also do not admit the established facts. As a result, they lost some grain (not actively tapping potential) and buried some grain (some townships and cooperatives concealed production and privately divided, and lowered the actual output). Leting County is an example. This county has better soil conditions and has always ranked first in the entire prefecture in terms of output. It is known as the "Ukraine" of China. However, in recent years, due to the county party committee's serious right-leaning conservative ideology, production has developed very slowly, and there has even been a phenomenon of retrogression. Last year, they were willing to admit that they were no longer the "Ukraine." This year, when entering the season of the autumn harvest, according to their estimates, the average yield per mu in the county would not exceed 340 jin. After the three expanded meetings of the prefectural committee, the county party committee carried out criticism and self-criticism, overcame right-leaning conservative thinking, and as a result, the grain yield per mu jumped from 332 jin last year to 407 jin, and regained the reputation of "Ukraine." This is not because they used the method of careful harvesting and fine beating to increase dozens of jin of grain per mu in a short period of one month, but because their minds were opened and a lot of grain was released. Li Jian, the second secretary of the county party committee, said correctly in his检讨 (jiǎntǎo - self-criticism) speech at the four-level cadre meeting of the prefectural committee held in November: without a great leap forward in thinking, there can be no great leap forward in production.

In terms of leadership methods, Zunhua, Funing, Lulong and other counties have always paid attention to cultivating key points, establishing banners, and using the experience of key points to guide the overall situation. These three counties have cultivated eleven key cooperatives in recent years. In addition to sending members of the county party committee or other strong cadres to reside in the cooperatives for a long time, the county party secretary often goes deep into the key points to create and summarize experience. Because the leadership of the key points has been strengthened, not only have banners been established, but also the correctness of general calls can be tested, leadership experience has been enriched, and the overall work has been powerfully promoted. Zunhua County often organizes activities to visit, "study," and hold discussions at key cooperatives. This year alone, it has organized 94 times and promoted more than 100 advanced experiences, which has played a great role in promoting production. Funing promoted the experience of "挖堰 (wā yàn - ditch digging)" to maintain soil and water in Qingshankou, Shuangling Township. "挖堰 (wā yàn - ditch digging)" has expanded to 180,000 mu in the county, becoming an important measure to achieve a yield of 400 jin per mu in the county. However, some counties have not made good use of this important leadership method. Shengang Red Flag Cooperative in Fengrun County, Liu Shoucheng Cooperative in Sanlizhuang, Luanxian County, and Ma Ruiming Cooperative in Bianjiapu, Yutian County, were all the earliest cooperatives in the entire prefecture, and they were also well-known banner cooperatives in the entire prefecture. Due to the leadership's failure to recognize the important significance of cultivating key points and abandoning leadership, these cooperatives failed to play a key role, and the leadership flowed into generalities. Sometimes the work is very difficult and passive.

Now, all counties have conducted inspections and criticisms of right-leaning conservative thinking in accordance with the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. On the basis of accepting historical lessons, they have formulated agricultural production increase plans for 1958. Combining the plans of various counties, the entire prefecture guarantees an average yield of 426 jin per mu, striving for 458 jin, exceeding the production requirements of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) for areas north of the Yellow River.

    平原为什么不如山区？
    中共河北省唐山地委第一书记　周振华
    河北省唐山专区，是一个半平原半山区的地区。全区共十个县，即乐亭、丰润、滦县、昌黎、玉田等五个平原县，遵化、抚宁、卢龙、迁安、迁西等五个山区县。农业生产以粮食为主。随着农业合作化的发展，粮食生产逐年提高。从1952年以来，平均每年增长速度为10％左右，如果除去受水灾严重减产的1953年，则平均每年增长13％。今年全区普遍丰收，粮食亩产达到三百六十七斤，比去年增长13.75％，比1952年增长55.11％。全区90.36％的社比去年增产，77.2％的社赶上或超过了当地富裕中农的生产水平。
    但是，唐山专区各地区之间，生产发展是不平衡的，最显著的表现，是山区发展速度较快，平原发展速度较慢。山区五个县由1952年亩产二百三十八斤，今年提高到三百八十六斤，增长了66％；平原五个县由1952年亩产二百四十一斤，今年提高到三百五十四斤，增长了46.88％。特别是高级合作化以后，山区、平原发展速度的差别更为明显。山区五个县1956年比1955年生产增长19.62％，而平原五个县则只增长0.68％。今年山区的遵化、抚宁、卢龙三个县已经达到亩产四百斤以上，提前十年实现了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）中黄河以北的地区产量指标，平原只有乐亭一个县达到了这个指标。
    按自然条件来说，平原比山区优越得多，为什么山区增产速度快，平原增产速度却慢呢？从几个对增产带有关键性的措施上作对比，就可以找到答案。
    首先，从施肥上看，山区施肥量比平原多。这又跟养猪多少有着重大关系。根据到今年10月底的统计，山区五个县养猪由1952年的四十五万四千八百七十五头，发展到八十三万七千九百六十二头（不包括卖给国家和群众宰杀的头数），增长了84.2％，平原五个县养猪由1952年的六十一万三千一百三十一头，发展到七十六万一千一百九十九头（不包括卖给国家和群众宰杀的头数），仅增长了24.14％。由于山区养猪多，平原养猪少，因而施肥量有显著的不同。遵化养猪发展到平均每户四头猪，三亩二分地一头猪，施肥量1951年不足二千斤，1957年达到六千多斤。玉田县养猪每户平均才一头多，平均十一亩七分地一头猪，施肥量两千到三千斤。施肥量多少，对于增产速度快慢起着决定性的作用。如遵化范家岭，1953年养猪八十六头，很多地不施肥，施肥的地最多两千斤，平均亩产一百六十斤；今年养猪八百三十六头，平均每人一头半猪，一亩地一头猪，每亩施肥八千斤，亩产提高到四百四十五斤。丰润、滦县的沿海及玉田的低洼地区，很少养猪，甚至连厕所也不修建，很多地不施肥，施肥的才一千斤左右，产量不过一、二百斤。
    其次，从作物配置上看，高产作物（玉米、白薯、稻谷等）在山区所占耕地面积的比重比平原大。山区五个县今年高产作物面积占粮食作物总面积的54.07％，其产量占总产量的75.05％；而平原五个县高产作物面积只占粮食作物总面积的48.43％，产量占总产量的70.19％。如果平原的高产作物赶上山区的比重，则能增产一亿六千万斤粮食。
    第三，从水利建设上看，山区比平原开展的较好，也较多。两年来，山区五个县水浇地扩大到七十五万一千五百三十八亩，占宜浇地面积的43.6％；而平原五个县扩大到一百零七万二千三百五十五亩，只占宜浇地面积的24％。同时，山区几年来大力开展水土保持工作，共控制流域面积六百多平方公里。这也是促使生产迅速发展的一个重要因素。如遵化县西四十里铺乡建明社，近年来积极兴修水利，凡能用水浇的旱地，都变成了水浇地；还修筑水土保持工程，使一千多亩地免受山洪冲刷，保证了连年丰收。去年粮食平均亩产四百四十斤，今年又提高到五百十七斤，比建社前增长了五倍。
    为什么山区在几个关键性的增产措施方面都做得比平原好呢？当然，山区人民在历史上除了同样受着阶级压迫，还受着自然条件给予的深重灾难，因此，他们艰苦奋斗，向自然作斗争的革命精神比较容易发扬起来。同时，唐山专区的山区又多是老解放区，在党和人民政府多年的领导下，这里的人民已经积累了不少向自然斗争的经验。可是，平原的生产不如山区，根本原因还是在于领导方面。
    在领导思想上，几年来的事实证明：遵化、抚宁、卢龙等县的领导思想是对头的。因此，领导干部有决心，有魄力，能够因地制宜地挖掘潜力，能够虚心学习外地经验。而丰润等县某些领导干部则有程度不同的右倾保守思想，看不到本地区的有利条件，片面强调困难条件，更看不到合作化以后的新情况，墨守成规，安于现状，认为不能打破历史常规，事事只往后看，不往前看。这样，自然不能积极挖掘增产潜力；对外地的成绩和经验，往往抱怀疑和否定态度，甚至存有嫉妒思想，更谈不到虚心学习，钻研创造。他们在制订生产计划的时候，不承认实现的可能性；在核定实产量的时候，也不承认既成的事实。结果，丢了一部分粮食（不积极挖掘潜力），埋了一部分粮食（部分乡、社瞒产私分、压低实产）。乐亭县就是一个例子。这个县土质条件较好，产量在历史上始终占全专区第一位，有中国的“乌克兰”之称。但近几年来由于县委领导思想严重的右倾保守，生产发展很慢，甚至有倒退现象，去年他们竟甘心承认已经不是“乌克兰”了。今年进入大秋的时候，照他们估计，全县平均亩产不超过三百四十斤；地委三次扩大会议以后，县委开展了批评与自我批评，克服了右倾保守思想，结果粮食亩产由去年的三百三十二斤，一跃而达到四百零七斤，又恢复了“乌克兰”的名誉。这倒不是他们在短短的一个月的时间，用精收细打的办法，使一亩地增加了几十斤粮食，而是因为思想上开了门，放出了很多粮食。该县县委第二书记李健同志在11月召开的地委四级干部会上的检讨发言中说的对：没有思想上的大跃进，就不可能有生产上的大跃进。
    在领导方法上，遵化、抚宁、卢龙等县始终注意培养重点，树立旗帜，运用重点经验指导全面。这三个县几年来培养了十一个重点社，除派县委委员或其它坚强干部长期驻社以外，县委书记经常深入重点，创造和总结经验。由于加强了对重点的领导，不仅树立了旗帜，而且可以检验一般号召是否正确，丰富了领导经验，有力地推动了全面工作。遵化县经常组织到重点社去参观、“留学”、座谈的活动，仅今年就组织了九十四次，推广先进经验一百多项，这对推动生产起了很大作用。抚宁推广了双岭乡青山口“等高撩壕”（挖堰）保持水土的经验，全县“等高撩壕”扩大到十八万亩，成为实现全县四百斤产量的一项重要措施。但有的县却没有很好的运用这一重要的领导方法。丰润县深港红旗社，滦县三里庄刘守成社，玉田县边家铺马瑞明社，都是全专区最早的合作社，也是全专区知名的旗帜社，由于领导上没有认识到培养重点的重要意义，放弃领导，使这些社没有发挥重点作用，领导也就流于一般化，有时工作很吃力很被动。
    现在各县都根据党的八届三中全会精神，对右倾保守思想进行了检查和批判，在接受历史教训的基础上，制订了1958年的农业增产计划。综合各县计划，全专区保证平均亩产四百二十六斤，争取四百五十八斤，超过全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）对黄河以北地区的产量要求。
