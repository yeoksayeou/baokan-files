Dear fellow workers of the nation:

The Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions has concluded victoriously. This congress was held at a time when the socialist revolution and socialist construction in our country had achieved great victories, when our country's first Five-Year Plan for developing the national economy had been completed and overfulfilled, and when the world situation had entered a new turning point favorable to socialism. The congress reviewed with confidence the achievements of the Chinese working class in completing the first Five-Year Plan and looked forward to the great future of the Chinese working class and the people of the whole country.

Fellow workers! The second Five-Year Plan is about to begin, and even more arduous tasks are waiting for us. We must resolutely respond to the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to "build the country diligently and thriftily, run enterprises diligently and thriftily, and run all undertakings diligently and thriftily," take practical actions, show our enthusiasm, work actively, and advance bravely, together with the people of the whole country, to build our country into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture and a modern science and culture as quickly as possible! We must catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products in fifteen years!

Fellow workers! We must deeply carry out socialist emulation, start a new upsurge in production, do our work conscientiously in our respective positions, and continue to promote the spirit of mutual help, mutual learning, learning from each other's strengths, and common improvement, to make production more, faster, better, more economical, and safer!

Fellow workers! The Party and the state require us to develop industry and agriculture simultaneously on the basis of giving priority to the development of heavy industry. We must vigorously support agricultural construction, produce more and better agricultural tools, fertilizers, water conservancy equipment and daily necessities for the broad masses of farmers; we must actively help farmers realize the agricultural development program and build a new socialist countryside!

Fellow workers! We must actively participate in the rectification campaign and socialist education movement, constantly improve our awareness, strengthen unity, and overcome the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie. Under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party, we must strive to become conscious, organized, disciplined, and cultured and technically proficient fighters for socialist construction!

Fellow workers! We must further participate actively in enterprise management with the spirit of being masters of our own affairs and loving the factory as our home, take the initiative to find ways to help the enterprise administration improve its management, overcome difficulties, pool our wisdom and efforts, and run our socialist enterprises well!

Fellow workers! We must proceed from the overall interests and long-term interests of the 600 million people of the country and gradually improve our lives on the basis of developing industrial and agricultural production! In terms of welfare work, we must do the most with the least money!

Fellow family members of workers! We must be diligent and thrifty in managing our households, arrange our family life well, and educate our children well; neighbors should be united and harmonious, and love and help each other!

Fellow activists of the trade union! We must guard against arrogance and rashness, maintain close ties with the masses, fully promote democracy in our work, widely attract workers to participate in trade union activities, and serve the masses with enthusiasm!

Dear fellow workers of the nation! We have the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the help of the great Soviet Union and fraternal countries, and the support of the working class and peace-loving people all over the world. As long as we unite with the broad masses of peasants and intellectuals, and unite all forces that can be united at home and abroad, no difficulty can stop our progress, and we will certainly be able to build our country into a great, prosperous and strong socialist country!

Dear comrades! The infinitely glorious future of our motherland is encouraging us to advance bravely. We must unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, work hard with the highest labor enthusiasm, the most humble learning spirit, and the greatest confidence and courage, study actively, and strive to realize our great and glorious task!

Dear fellow workers of the nation, the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions extends the most sublime salute of the working class to you!
