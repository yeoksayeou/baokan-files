Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 16th December: Hu Yaobang, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League, recently gave a report entitled "Broaden Your Vision, Advance Resolutely" to youth activists in Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province. He called on young people to take the lead in going to the countryside and mountains to temper themselves in the great crucible of labor.

Hu Yaobang's report discussed the three measures currently being taken in our country to implement the policy of "hard work and thrift in building the country," namely, rectification, streamlining institutions and transferring cadres, and saving and using resources frugally to develop production. Hu Yaobang said that rectification is to improve the fighting spirit of the revolutionary ranks, so that millions of party members, league members, and revolutionary cadres can truly become the backbone of the people and a backbone force and vanguard force that cannot be scattered or destroyed after rectification.

When talking about the work of streamlining institutions and transferring cadres, Hu Yaobang said that only labor can transform everything. A few people doubt whether participating in labor can transform intellectuals, and some even suggest that watching movies can also transform them, and that going to the countryside wastes their youth. He pointed out: I think only participating in labor is the only correct path. Labor is a crucible. Whether you dare to throw yourself into this crucible depends on your revolutionary will. We need a group of brave people to take the lead in going to the countryside and mountains with loyalty. He called on young people to show their revolutionary will and throw themselves into this great crucible.

Hu Yaobang said that saving and using resources frugally, working together with one heart and one mind, and developing production are the most fundamental ways for us to implement the policy of building the country through diligence and frugality. We must save and use resources frugally, work hard, and prepare to do it for ten or fifteen years. Hu Yaobang said that our country has undergone two transformations. The first transformation was overthrowing the Kuomintang reactionaries, which was achieved in 1949. The first transformation took twenty-eight years from 1921 to 1949. The second transformation, if calculated from 1953, will take fifteen to twenty years, and five years have already passed. If our country's grain output can reach 800 billion jin per year by 1967, and our country's population is 800 million at that time, each person will have an average of 1,000 jin of grain. If there are 500 to 800 million pigs and 60 to 80 million dan of cotton at that time, the living conditions of our country will be greatly changed. Hu Yaobang called on young people to broaden their vision, look at ten or fifteen years, see a prosperous and powerful new socialist China, and resolutely move forward.

### 把眼光放远点　干它十年十五年  胡耀邦号召青年带头上山下乡

　　把眼光放远点　干它十年十五年
    胡耀邦号召青年带头上山下乡
    新华社长沙16日电　中国共产主义青年团中央委员会第一书记胡耀邦最近在湖南省株洲市向全市的青年活动分子作了题为“眼光远大、坚决前进”的报告，他号召青年们带头上山下乡，到劳动的大熔炉里去锻炼自己。
    胡耀邦的报告谈到了我国目前为了执行“艰苦奋斗，勤俭建国”的方针而采取的三个措施，即整风，紧缩机构、下放干部和省吃省用、发展生产。胡耀邦说，整风是为了提高革命队伍的斗志，使千百万党员、团员和革命干部经过整风能真正成为人民群众的骨干，成为一支打不散、摧不垮的骨干力量、先锋力量。
    胡耀邦谈到紧缩机构、下放干部的工作时说，只有劳动才能改造一切，少数人怀疑参加劳动能不能改造知识分子，甚至有人提出看电影也一样可以改造，下乡浪费了自己的青春。他指出：我看只有参加劳动，才是唯一的正确的道路，劳动是个熔炉，敢不敢投到这个熔炉里去，那就要看革命的意志。我们需要有一批勇敢分子，忠心耿耿地带头下乡上山。他号召青年们拿出革命的意志来，投身到这个大熔炉里去。
    胡耀邦说，省吃省用、同心同德、发展生产，是我们执行勤俭建国方针最根本的办法。我们要省吃省用、艰苦奋斗，准备干它十年、十五年。胡耀邦说，我们国家有两个翻身，第一个翻身是打倒国民党反动派，这在1949年就实现了。第一个翻身从1921年到1949年翻了二十八年。第二个翻身如果从1953年算起，要十五年到二十年，现在已经过去五年。到1967年我国的粮食产量如果每年可以达到八千亿斤，而我国那时的人口是八亿，每人平均就有一千斤粮食。如果那时猪有五亿到八亿头，棉花有六千到八千万担，我们国家的生活面貌就会大大改变。胡耀邦号召青年们把眼光放远点，看十年、十五年，看到一个富饶强大的社会主义新中国，坚决前进。
