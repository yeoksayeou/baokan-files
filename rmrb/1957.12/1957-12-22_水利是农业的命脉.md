Water Conservancy is the Lifeline of Agriculture

"One drop of water, one grain of rice," "Water is food," "Get food from water" – these are the heartfelt feelings of Chinese farmers about the relationship between water and food.

Historical Frequency of Waterlogging and Drought Disasters

The threat of waterlogging and drought to agricultural production is widespread, severe, and historical. According to historical records, from 206 BC to 1936 AD, a total of 2,142 years, there were 1,031 major floods and 1,060 droughts in China, averaging almost one flood or drought per year. According to incomplete statistics, in 1928, thirteen provinces in North China, Northwest China, and Southwest China suffered widespread drought, with drought-stricken counties accounting for more than a quarter of the country's total. The number of disaster victims reached 120 million, and the average harvest of agricultural products was less than 20%, with many places harvesting nothing. In 1931, a major flood in the country affected 120 million mu in the Yangtze and Huai River basins alone. Rice losses accounted for 38% of the normal total output, and cotton losses accounted for 24% of the normal total output. During the 267 years of the Qing Dynasty, there were 201 droughts. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, water conservancy was neglected, and forests were destroyed, making droughts even more severe. Since liberation, due to the large-scale development of water conservancy, the disaster situation in some areas has been significantly alleviated, but it has not been completely eliminated. The following are the figures for grain production reduction caused by waterlogging and drought disasters over the years (unit: 100 million catties):

1949	114	1953	150
1950	52	1954	177
1951	63	1955	128
1952	—	1956	244

Droughts Can Be Conquered

People generally believe that the cause of drought is dry climate and low rainfall. Most agricultural areas in China are located in the monsoon zone. Due to the influence of monsoons, most of the rainfall is concentrated in summer, which makes it easy to cause spring and autumn droughts. However, low rainfall does not necessarily cause drought. Please see the following facts.

During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in western Hunan Province had uneven rainfall distribution. Coupled with the neglect of water conservancy, only about 30% of the paddy fields in the prefecture had water conservancy facilities. Therefore, droughts occurred frequently, and grain had to be transported from other places every year. This year, although the prefecture encountered a severe drought, thanks to the Party's leadership in mobilizing the masses to build water conservancy projects, it not only became self-sufficient in grain but also transported a large amount of surplus grain to support national construction.

This year, the drought in Hubei Province was much more severe than in 1952, but because of the construction of farmland water conservancy and the technical reform of agricultural production, grain output increased by 30% and cotton output increased by 60% compared with 1952. Yangwacao Agricultural Cooperative in Gaolan County, Gansu Province, is a mountain village that suffers from drought nine years out of ten. In the past, none of the more than 6,300 mu of land had water. After liberation, it experienced four drought years, and in the first three drought years, it needed state relief. After cooperativization, the cooperative built farmland water conservancy, turning 1,117 mu of dry land into irrigated land. In the fourth drought year, it not only did not need state relief but also sold 50,000 catties of surplus grain. In Guangxi Province, after cooperativization in 1956, the irrigated area increased to 4.94 million mu, overcoming the worst drought in decades. During the First Five-Year Plan period, Guangdong Province vigorously built farmland water conservancy, and seventeen counties and three cities basically eliminated drought disasters, and twenty-one counties and four cities initially eliminated drought disasters. However, during the enemy's puppet rule in 1943, a drought affected 80% of Guangdong Province, resulting in crop failures and famine, and 3 million people starved to death. In 1955, the province suffered the worst drought in nearly sixty years, but grain output increased by 2.1 billion catties, and six 1,000-catty counties – Chenghai, Chao'an, Chaoyang, Jieyang, Puning, and Nan'ao – 502 1,000-catty townships, and 870 1,000-catty cooperatives emerged, becoming famous throughout the country. Gansu Province, which has a history of severe droughts, experienced more than 100 droughts in the 200 years before liberation. After liberation, thanks to the construction of farmland water conservancy, it basically overcame the droughts and transformed from a grain-deficient province into a self-sufficient province. These facts show that only under the leadership of the Communist Party and relying on the strength of agricultural cooperativization can miracles of overcoming droughts and increasing agricultural production occur.

Turning Water Disasters into Water Conservancy

Water disasters generally include floods and waterlogging. In some areas and in some years, waterlogging is more serious than floods. For example, in Hebei Province from 1949 to 1954, the area affected by waterlogging accounted for an average of 66% of the area affected by water disasters; in the Huai River Plain, waterlogging and flood disasters were almost equal; in the Yangtze River embankments, such as the Dongting Lake area, more than 1 million mu of farmland out of more than 5 million mu of cultivated land could not be produced annually due to waterlogging. In Hebei Province and thirteen provinces and one city in Northeast China, East China, and Central China, waterlogging disasters occur frequently; the area prone to waterlogging is generally more than 90 million mu. Hebei Province is the worst, with a normally waterlogged area of 25 million mu, reaching a maximum of 45 million mu. Therefore, people in low-lying areas of Hebei Province used to call their hometowns "toad land," "regret land," and "bitter sea."

In recent years, relying on the strength of agricultural cooperation, various localities have actively built farmland water conservancy, making great achievements in flood control and drainage. Yingkou County (Liaoning Province) in the lower reaches of the Liao River has 13,000 hectares of land in the water source area, all of which were subject to waterlogging in the past, except for 500 hectares of higher land. Before liberation, farmers relied on weaving mats and making straw sandals for a living due to years of disasters, and some even sold their children because they could not make a living. After liberation in 1949, farmers in the county began to build projects such as the Liao River embankment, basically eliminating waterlogging. In 1956, the high tide of agricultural cooperativization, the area of paddy fields had increased to 11,240 hectares. Now, the area not only no longer needs the state to supply more than one million catties of grain every year, but also can sell more than 90 million catties of surplus grain. In 1955, Tianjin Prefecture, Hebei Province, based on summarizing the masses' experience in controlling waterlogging, formulated the policy of "utilizing nature, transforming nature, and turning water disasters into water conservancy" and launched a struggle against waterlogging disasters. Every year, it mobilizes 150,000 to 160,000 laborers to build farmland water conservancy, and at the same time, develops water-resistant and high-yield crops according to the specific conditions of low-lying areas. After three years of hard struggle, it has changed the poverty-stricken appearance of low-lying areas. According to a survey of 147 agricultural cooperatives, these cooperatives have all caught up with or surpassed the local wealthy middle peasant level. From 1949 to 1955, the area benefiting from flood control and drainage projects completed in eleven provinces including Henan and Hebei reached more than 58 million mu. In 1956, ten provinces carried out flood control and drainage engineering measures on more than 40 million mu of cultivated land.

Due to mountain torrents and floods, Shanxi Province has suffered an average of more than 1.2 million mu of cultivated land from floods every year for the past seven years. It has also caused greater flood disasters to downstream provinces such as Hebei and Henan. As of the end of 1956, the province had built more than 70,000 flood control and drainage projects, afforested and closed mountains for forest cultivation on 19.8 million mu, built 10.7 million mu of terraced fields, and planted 5.21 million mu of pasture, which can control soil erosion on 42.85 million mu. For example, Hongzhao County's 150,000 mu of flood land has an average grain yield of 300 catties per mu. Jinluo Township's Jinxing Agricultural Cooperative in Zhongyang County, where soil erosion is the most serious, originally had more than 300 mu that suffered from floods every year. In 1955, production was reduced by more than 20,000 catties due to the disaster. In 1956, after soil and water conservation was carried out, although there were 14 major rainstorms, soil and water did not leave the ditches, and the plains were not eroded, resulting in a bumper harvest.

Development of Irrigation

Vigorously developing farmland water conservancy is not only for disaster prevention and production protection, but more importantly for increasing production. According to many typical surveys, after farmland is irrigated, combined with other agricultural measures, the yield generally increases by 50% to 100%, and in some areas it increases by two or three times.

Crop Yield Increase in Key Irrigation Areas

Area	Irrigation Area	Crop	Irrigated Land	Non-Irrigated Land
		 	Mu Yield (Catties)	Mu Yield (Catties)
Shandong	Yuyuan Canal	Wheat	260	120
Shaanxi	Jinghui Canal	Cotton	285	195
Shaanxi	Weihui Canal	Corn	417	220
Sichuan	Guan Song ?	Rice	585	360
Hebei	Rongzhen Canal	Millet	200	90

Due to the construction of farmland irrigation projects, the area of paddy fields in Liaoning Province increased three times in 1956 compared with 1949, and the output increased six times. During the First Five-Year Plan period in Inner Mongolia, 5.7 million mu of dry land was transformed into paddy fields, and the output increased by 1.1 billion catties in five years. The output of the Xiyun River Irrigation Area in Yongning, Guangxi Province, increased from 1 million catties to 5 million catties before and after the construction of water conservancy. After the construction of farmland water conservancy in Zhejiang Province, more than 2.05 million mu of "rain-fed land" was transformed into fertile land, more than 2.83 million mu of single-season rice was transformed into double-season rice, 20 million mu of fields improved their drought resistance, 8.48 million mu of waterlogged fields were transformed, and more than 10 million mu of land was protected. As farmland water conservancy facilities increased year by year in Jiangxi Province, millions of mu of single-season rice became double-season rice, and the output increased from 7.7054 billion catties in 1949 to 13 billion catties. Before liberation, the total grain output of the Miao Autonomous Prefecture in Hunan Province was only 400 to 600 million catties, and grain had to be transported from other places every year. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, water conservancy was built year after year. Although the prefecture suffered a drought this year, the total grain output still reached more than 1.1 billion catties, and a large amount of surplus grain could be transported out. In areas such as the Dulong and Kucong ethnic groups in Yunnan, paddy fields appeared for the first time due to the construction of water conservancy, and the local people tasted the fragrance of rice for the first time. Farmers in Jianli County, Hubei Province, circulated a song: "With water but no fertilizer, half a grain; with fertilizer but no water, looking at the sky and crying."

"People cannot live without blood, and fields cannot live without water." "Developing agriculture, building water conservancy, for the country, benefiting ourselves." These facts further embody the meaning of Chairman Mao's saying: "Water conservancy is the lifeline of agriculture."

After the liberation of the whole country, under the leadership of the Party, farmland water conservancy has greatly developed. In terms of water management ideology, the old concept of "water is a disaster" has also been reversed, and the practice of quickly sending water to the sea or pushing it to other places has been changed. Now, many people realize that water is the wealth of the people, and we must cherish it and make full use of it. We must "turn water disasters into water conservancy." The national irrigated area has increased from more than 230 million mu at the time of liberation to 520 million mu (statistics as of the end of July this year). The number added in the years since liberation is more than double the accumulated irrigated area in the thousands of years before liberation. In 1956 alone, when cooperativization greatly developed, the area was expanded by more than 110 million mu.

At present, the proportion of irrigated area to cultivated area in my country has increased from 16.3% in 1949 to 30.5%.

The following is the annual increase in the national irrigated area since liberation (unit: 10,000 mu)

1950	1951	1952	1953	1954	1955	1956	July 1957

    水利是农业的命脉
    “一滴水，一粒粮”“水就是粮食”“向水要粮食”这是我国农民对水和粮食关系的切身感受。
    历史上水旱灾情频多
    水旱灾对农业生产的威胁，是普遍、严重而有历史性的。据历史记载，我国自公元前206年到1936年共二千一百四十二年间，发生过较大水灾一千零三十一次，旱灾一千零六十次，几乎平均每年一次水灾或旱灾。据不完全资料统计，1928年华北、西北、西南等区十三个省普遍遭旱，受旱县占全国县份四分之一强。灾民达一亿二千万人，农产品收获量平均不足二成，很多地方颗粒未收。1931年全国大水，仅长江、淮河流域即有一亿二千万亩，水稻损失占常年总产量的38％，棉花损失占常年总产量的24％。在清代二百六十七年中间，就发生了旱灾二百零一次。到了国民党反动统治时期，水利失修，山林破坏，旱灾更加严重。解放以后，由于水利建设大规模开展，部分地区灾害情况已有显著减轻，但还未能全部消除。下面是历年因水旱灾造成的粮食减产数字。（单位：亿斤）
    1949年  114，  1953年  150，
    1950年  52，  1954年  177，
    1951年  63，  1955年  128，

    旱灾可以战胜
    人们通常认为，旱灾的原因是由于气候干燥，降雨量少。我国绝大部分农业区均处于季风带内，由于受季风的影响，雨量大部分集中在夏季，因而易于发生春旱，秋旱。但是雨量少不一定就会造成旱灾。请看下面的事实。
    在国民党反动统治年代里，湘西土家族、苗族自治州雨量分布不匀，加上水利失修，全州有水利设施的稻田只有30％左右，因此经常发生旱灾，年年要从外地运进粮食。今年，全州虽然遇到了严重的旱象，但由于党领导群众兴修水利，粮食不但自足，并且还有大批余粮外运，支援国家建设。
    今年，湖北全省旱灾比1952年更严重得多，但因兴修了农田水利和进行了农业生产的技术改革等工作，粮食产量却比1952年增产30％，棉花增产60％。甘肃省皋兰县阳洼窑农业合作社，是十年九旱的山村，过去六千三百多亩地，无一亩水地。解放后经历了四个旱年，头三个旱年都需待国家救济。在合作化后，这个社兴修了农田水利，使一千一百一十七亩旱地变为水地，第四个旱年不但不用国家救济，而且卖出五万斤余粮。广西省1956年合作化后，灌溉面积增加到四百九十四万亩，战胜了几十年没有的大旱灾。在第一个五年计划期间，广东省大力兴修了农田水利，有十七个县三个市基本消灭旱灾，二十一个县、四个市初步消灭旱灾。可是，在1943年敌伪统治时期，一次旱灾广东全省就有80％的地区受旱，失收歉收，饿死三百万人。1955年全省又遭到近六十年所未有的严重旱灾，却增产粮食二十一亿斤，并出现了全国闻名的澄海、潮安、潮阳、揭阳、普宁、南澳等六个千斤县，五百零二个千斤乡，八百七十个千斤社。我国历史上干旱严重的甘肃省，解放前二百多年中发生旱灾一百多次，而解放后由于兴修农田水利，基本上战胜了旱灾，由缺粮省变成为粮食自供自足省份。这些事实说明只有在共产党领导下，并且依靠农业合作化的力量，才能出现战胜旱灾、增加农业生产的奇迹。
    变水害为水利
    关于水灾，一般都包括洪水和内涝。有些地区和有些年份的水灾，内涝比洪水更为严重。如河北省1949年至1954年间，内涝灾害面积平均占水灾面积的66％；淮河平原内涝和洪水灾害几乎相等；长江圩堄如洞庭湖区五百余万亩耕地中就每年经常有一百多万亩农田因内涝而不能生产。在河北省及东北、华东、华中等十三个省一个市的地区，经常有涝灾发生；一般年份易涝面积九千多万亩。其中以河北省为最甚，平常易涝面积有二千五百万亩，最大时达四千五百万亩。因之河北省低洼地区人民过去称自己家乡为“蛤蟆地”“后悔地”“苦海”。
    几年来，各地依靠农业合作的力量积极兴修农田水利，在防洪排涝方面，做出了很大的成绩。辽河下游的营口县（辽宁省）水源区有一万三千公顷土地，过去除五百公顷较高地外，全部受涝。解放前因年年受灾，农民依靠织席打草鞋为生，有的甚至生活无着而卖儿女。1949年解放后全县农民开始修筑辽河堤防等工程，基本上解除了涝害。农业合作化高潮的1956年，稻田面积已增加到一万一千二百四十垧。这个区现在不仅不再每年需要国家供应百余万斤粮食，而且全区能卖出余粮九千多万斤。河北省天津专区在1955年在总结群众的治涝经验的基础上，制订了“利用自然，改造自然，变水患为水利”的方针，向涝灾展开斗争。每年发动十五、六万劳动力兴修农田水利，同时根据低洼地区的具体情况发展耐水高产作物，经过三年的艰苦斗争，改变了低洼区的贫困面貌。据一百四十七个农业社调查，这些社都已经赶上或超过当地富裕中农水平。河南、河北等十一个省，从1949年到1955年所完成的防涝排水工程受益面积就达五千八百多万亩。1956年十个省又在四千多万亩耕地上进行了防涝排水的工程措施。
    山西省由于山洪暴发，泛滥成灾，七年来，全省平均每年有一百二十多万亩耕地遭受洪灾。并给下游的河北、河南等省造成更大洪水灾害。该省截至1956年底，共修成防洪排涝工程七万多宗，造林和封山育林一千九百八十万亩，修梯田一千零七十万亩，种牧草五百二十一万亩后，可控制水土流失面积四千二百八十五万亩。例如洪赵县十五万亩洪水地每亩产粮平均还达三百斤。水土流失最严重的中阳县金罗乡金星农业合作社，原有三百多亩平均每年遭水灾，1955年因灾减产二万多斤；1956年进行水土保持之后，虽经十四次较大暴雨，水土均未出沟，平地未遭冲蚀，因而获得丰收。
    灌溉事业的发展
    大力发展农田水利不仅仅是为了防灾保产，更主要的是为了增产。据许多典型调查，农田得到灌溉以后，结合其他农业措施，一般增产50％到一倍，有些地区增产两三倍。
    重点灌区作物增产情况
    地区    灌区    作物    灌溉地    非灌地
                            亩产（斤） 亩产（斤）
    山东    冶源渠  小麦    260       120
    陕西    泾惠渠  棉花    285       195
    陕西    渭惠渠  玉米    417       220
    四川    官宋硼? 水稻    585       360
    河北    荣臻渠  小米    200       90
    由于兴修农田灌溉工程，辽宁省水稻面积1956年比1949年增加三倍，产量增加了六倍。在内蒙古第一个五年计划期间，把五百七十万亩旱地变水田，五年增产达十一亿斤。广西邕宁西云江灌溉区兴修水利前后产量由一百万斤，增加到五百万斤。浙江省兴修农田水利后，二百零五万多亩“靠天田”变良田，二百八十三万多亩单季稻变双季，二千万亩田提高抗旱能力，八百四十八万多亩积涝田改变，一千多万亩地得到保产。江西省随农田水利设施的逐年增加数百万亩一季稻变成双季，产量由1949年七十七亿零五十四万斤上升到一百三十亿斤。湖南的苗族自治州解放前粮食总产量只有四到六亿斤，年年要由外地运来粮食。解放后在党的领导下连年兴修水利，今年全州虽然遭受了旱灾，但粮食总产量仍然高达十一亿多万斤，并能把大量余粮外运。云南的独龙人、苦聪人等地区，由于兴修了水利，第一次出现了水田，当地人民第一次尝到大米饭的香味。湖北监利县农民流传着的歌谣：“有水无肥一半谷，有肥无水望天哭。”
    “人少不得血，田少不了水。”“兴农田，修水利，为国家，利自己。”这些事实更体现出毛主席说：“水利是农业的命脉”的意义。
    全国解放后在党的领导下，农田水利有了大发展。在治水思想上也扭转了“水是灾害”的旧观念，改变了把水快送到海里或推到别的地方的作法。现在很多人都认识到水是人民的财富，要爱惜它，充分利用它，要“变水害为水利”全国灌溉面积已由解放时二亿三千多万亩发展到五亿二千万亩（到今年7月底统计）。解放几年来所增加的数字比解放前几千年积累的灌溉面积多一倍以上。仅合作化大发展的1956年就扩大了一亿一千多万亩。
    目前我国灌溉面积占耕地面积的比例，已由1949年的16.3％上升到30.5％。
    下面是解放以来全国灌溉面积历年增加的情况（单位：万亩）
