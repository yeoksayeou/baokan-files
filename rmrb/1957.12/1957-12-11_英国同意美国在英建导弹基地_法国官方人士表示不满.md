Xinhua News Agency, December 10th dispatch from London: U.S. Secretary of Defense Neil McElroy concluded three days of talks with British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd, and Defense Minister Duncan Sandys on the 9th, reaching an agreement on the issue of the U.S. establishing missile bases in Britain.

According to the contents of the agreement revealed by Western news agencies, Britain will sacrifice a portion of its national sovereignty, allowing the U.S. to establish four intermediate-range ballistic missile bases in Britain. Three of these will be controlled by Britain, and one by the U.S. The British government has also agreed to pay as much as $80 million to construct these bases.

The focus of the dispute during the talks was the question of who would control the nuclear warheads. According to reports, Britain requested that the U.S. agree to establish "broader political supervision" over U.S. nuclear weapons, bombers, and missiles stationed in Britain, because the British government is not satisfied with the existing arrangements for controlling U.S. nuclear bombers stationed in Britain. However, the U.S. insisted on maintaining complete U.S. control over the nuclear warheads. London political figures pointed out that in this regard, the British government is actually in the position of a petitioner, requesting U.S. ministers to agree to grant Britain the power to manage its own territory.

It is revealed that the talks also discussed the merger of parts of the U.S. and British air forces and navies.

Xinhua News Agency, December 10th dispatch from Paris: French official sources expressed great dissatisfaction on the 9th with the agreement reached between the U.S. and Britain on the establishment of missile launch bases in Britain. They believe this is another attempt to bypass other countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to establish a "core leadership" of the group by the U.S. and Britain.

According to reports, French officials commented on the agreement by saying that the entire issue of establishing missile bases should first be discussed by the NATO government heads of state conference to be held next week. These French officials stated that the French authorities believe that other member states of NATO should not be bound by this agreement.

    英国同意美国在英建导弹基地
    法国官方人士表示不满
    据新华社10日讯　伦敦消息：美国国防部长麦克艾罗伊同英国首相麦克米伦、外交大臣劳埃德、国防大臣桑迪斯在9日结束了为时三天的会谈，就美国在英国建立导弹基地问题达成了协议。
    根据西方通讯社透露的协议的内容，英国将牺牲一部分国家主权，准许美国在英国建立四个中程弹道导弹基地。其中三个由英国控制，一个由美国控制。英国政府并且已经同意支付数达八千万美元的经费来建筑这些基地。
    在会谈中，双方争论的焦点是由谁来控制核弹头的问题。据报道，英国要求美国同意对放置在英国的美国核武器、轰炸机和导弹建立“更加广泛的政治性监督”，因为英国政府对于现有的关于控制美国驻扎在英国的核轰炸机的安排并不满意。但是，美国方面坚持要保持美国对核弹头的完全控制。伦敦政界人士指出，在这方面，英国政府实际上是处于请求者的地位，请求美国部长同意给予英国以管理本国领土的权力。
    据透露，在这次会谈中还讨论了合并一部分美英空军和海军的问题。
    据新华社10日讯　巴黎消息：法国官方人士9日对美英两国达成关于在英国境内建立导弹发射基地问题的协议一事十分不满。他们认为这是又一次企图绕过北大西洋集团的其他国家来建立美英两国对这个集团的“核心领导”的行为。
    据报道，法国官员在评论这个协议时表示，建立导弹基地的整个问题应该首先由下周召开的北大西洋集团政府首脑会议来讨论。这些法国官员表示，法国当局认为北大西洋集团其他成员国不应该受这一协议的约束。
