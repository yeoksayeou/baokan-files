　　The CCP [Chinese Communist Party] Guoxian County Committee
　　In order to propel weak cooperatives to catch up with advanced cooperatives, the CCP Guoxian County Committee of Shanxi concentrated its efforts on rectifying forty weak cooperatives during this all-people rectification campaign.
　　Although the situations of these forty agricultural cooperatives varied, they all shared common characteristics: (1) The leadership of the management committee and production teams was controlled by landlords, rich peasants, wealthy middle peasants, merchants, and counter-revolutionaries, resulting in a serious spontaneous tendency towards capitalism. (2) Landlords, rich peasant elements, counter-revolutionary elements, and bad elements spread rumors, incited disturbances, retaliated, engaged in superstition, and gambled to carry out destructive activities. (3) Among the 680 Communist Party members in these forty cooperatives, 40% had a firm stance and worked actively; 35% had serious right-leaning tendencies and worked passively; 20% had serious capitalist ideologies and expressed doubts and dissatisfaction with the policies of the Party and the state; and the remaining 5% of Party members violated laws and discipline, degenerated, and some were even class enemies who had infiltrated the Party. Party member Wang Tiewen from Shangshe Village was a typical example. He consistently engaged in speculation and profiteering, hoarding large quantities of state materials. During the great debate, the following materials were found in a cellar in his home: twenty-one bicycles, two hundred and six bolts of various fabrics, over fifty *shi* of grain, one hundred and sixty-eight silver dollars, as well as large quantities of hemp skin, gourd oil, petroleum, and salt. He possessed immense wealth but constantly played the pauper, deliberately steaming corn husks for others to see, and inciting cooperative members to demand grain and dissolve the cooperative. (4) Production in these agricultural cooperatives was generally poor, with chaotic management. Taking Sanji Village Agricultural Cooperative as an example: the cooperative's grain yield declined year by year, from 255 *jin* per *mu* in 1955, to 233 *jin* in 1956, and 210 *jin* this year. One of the reasons for the reduction in production was chaotic management and unreasonable labor quotas. During the intense anti-drought struggle this year, one hundred and twenty-three cooperative members were working in their private plots, ninety-four were sitting idle, forty-one were running around trying to earn cash, and only forty-nine were working in the cooperative. The agricultural cooperative's five rubber-wheeled carts were used for transportation outside for seven months, with a net income of only 1,853 yuan, while unreasonable expenses amounted to 1,057 yuan. Financial accounts were not published on time, and cooperative members could not withdraw over 6,000 yuan in labor income; another group of cooperative members overspent by more than 3,800 yuan. The cooperative's four main cadres overspent by more than 200 yuan. The cooperative director, accountant, and other five cadres only worked five labor days in seven months.
　　After rectification, these agricultural cooperatives have fundamentally changed their backward appearance. The broad masses have strengthened their confidence and determination to follow the socialist road, and the spontaneous tendency towards capitalism has been greatly overcome. The work style of cadres has improved significantly, improving Party-mass relations and cadre-mass relations, purifying the Party ranks, and consolidating the cooperative. One hundred and seventy-nine backbone cadres for cooperative rectification were trained through practical work.
　　The Same Great Debate Method Should Be Adopted for Rectifying Weak Cooperatives
　　At the beginning of the cooperative rectification, the county committee underestimated the arduousness of rectifying weak cooperatives and dispersed the cadres participating in the rectification to ninety-two agricultural cooperatives, requiring them to be rectified in a very short period of time, which resulted in detours. The county committee learned from this lesson and concentrated the work teams in forty weak cooperatives, requiring them to basically rectify the cooperatives in forty to sixty days. At that time, some cadres sighed and lacked confidence when they heard that they were going to rectify weak cooperatives. The county committee criticized this erroneous thinking and encouraged everyone's confidence in overcoming difficulties.
　　After the work teams arrived in the villages, some comrades found everything displeasing and neglected to adopt the method of great debate, attempting to transform the weak cooperatives with simple, crude methods of rectification and deduction. One agricultural cooperative punished sixty people all at once, and a farmer was fined 100 yuan for stealing four ears of corn from the cooperative. After discovering this, the county committee promptly stopped their erroneous practices.
　　Use Class Analysis to Select Activists and Cultivate a Basic Team
　　It is not enough to rely solely on sending work teams from the leading organs to rectify weak cooperatives; it is necessary to organize a basic team composed mainly of Party members, League members, and activists from among the poor and lower-middle peasants. The reason why weak cooperatives are weak is precisely because they lack such a strong team. Before and after launching the great debate, the work teams devoted considerable effort to cultivating 1,600 activists, which played a significant role in the cooperative rectification. The work teams first explained the spirit of the central instructions to Party and League members, clarifying that the purpose of the great debate was to resolve the issue of who would win between the socialist and capitalist roads ideologically. On this basis, relying on the grassroots Party organizations, they used class analysis to analyze the ideological trends within and outside the Party and selected activists. After the basic socialist team was initially organized, the method of "ten looks and ten comparisons" was adopted, using political, production, material and cultural life, and social customs to inspire activists to compare the new and old societies. In the process of recollection and comparison, many people examined their right-leaning thoughts and confused concepts, and some tearfully reviewed certain erroneous remarks and thoughts of forgetting their roots. Through education, the activists distinguished right from wrong, raised their awareness, and learned the ability to lead the masses in great debate. Activists from the Xiawang Village Agricultural Cooperative proposed that the debate should pay attention to "four dos and four don'ts," which are: to reason, not to scold; to use your mouth, not your hands; to present facts, not empty talk; to speak to the point, not to talk nonsense. After the activists unified their thinking, the work teams further explained to them the methods and steps of the all-people rectification campaign, and then separately mobilized the masses to speak out freely and contend.
　　In weak cooperatives, the contradictions between the enemy and ourselves and the contradictions among the people are both more acute, capitalist ideology is prominent, and cooperative members have many opinions. When initially mobilizing the masses to speak out, the vast majority of people adopted a wait-and-see attitude, wondering if the work team was doing things practically? Would it protect people with problems? If problems were brought out but not resolved, would they be inviting trouble for themselves? At the beginning of the speaking out, people pushed back and forth, and those who spoke only said good things and not bad things, said things about the past and not the present, said things about the cooperative and not major national events, said empty words and not concrete problems. A group of wealthy middle peasants discussed and campaigned outside the meeting, instigating the masses and attacking the Party and cooperative leadership. A few extremely reactionary elements continued to carry out destructive activities. Those cooperative cadres with mistakes, fearing to get burned, emphasized that production was busy and they had no time to speak out. Or they only talked about the superiority of the advanced cooperative,堵住社员的嘴. Some believed that this year's crops were growing well, and as long as they could harvest more grain, they could explain it, and other problems were trivial matters and not worth debating.
　　In response to the above situation, in addition to reporting the great significance of the all-people rectification campaign to the masses, the work teams immediately addressed several issues of greatest concern to the masses in the cooperative. For example, the work team in the Sanji Agricultural Cooperative first helped the agricultural cooperative arrange the current production, working with the cooperative members during the day and dealing with problems in the evening. In a few days, they worked with the management committee to solve four urgent problems. The cadres with mistakes were mobilized to voluntarily "come downstairs" and make self-criticisms to the masses, stating that they would not retaliate against those who raised opinions. As a result, the masses reflected: "We didn't expect that the six people sent from above would do such a great thing for us." Then they vied with each other to speak out freely and contend. In order to let everyone speak out thoroughly and exhaustively, they also held forty-seven small heart-to-heart talks with various people, and collected many opinions through individual visits and casual conversations during production.
　　In order to remove obstacles in the great blooming and contending, some places, at the request of the masses, promptly cracked down on the enemy's destructive activities, making the masses deeply feel that the great blooming and contending was to promote righteousness and overwhelm evil, so they spoke out their inner thoughts without any scruples.
　　Grasp the Issues of Greatest Concern and Interest to Everyone and Mobilize the Masses to Debate
　　When organizing the great debate in weak cooperatives, it is necessary to initially grasp the main problems existing in the cooperative, and through typical figures, guide the center of the debate to the struggle between the two roads. Due to the reduction in grain production and cooperative members' income in Xiaoguxue Agricultural Cooperative last year, landlords, rich peasant elements, and a few wealthy middle peasants seized this handle and, during the blooming and contending stage, vigorously attacked the cooperative system, saying: "Last year was gray, this year is even grayer. If it doesn't collapse, every household will have to starve." They said that the cooperative was not run well because the state purchased too much grain. A few members of the masses were also blinded by their fallacies and blindly followed the shouting. In fact, the state's grain purchase has been decreasing year by year, from 860,000 *jin* in 1954 to 710,000 *jin* in 1956. Last year, each person received an average of 425 *jin* of grain. At the debate, these ironclad facts refuted their fallacies. Then everyone found the reason why the cooperative was not run well: the cooperative's leadership was controlled by the rich peasant element Zheng Xianlin (cooperative director). In order to dismantle the cooperative, he transferred a large number of cooperative members to build the stage enclosure wall during the busy season of weeding, which resulted in delaying weeding. Twenty-eight animals died in the cooperative, and he gloated, saying: "It's better to die than not to die. If they die, the insurance company will compensate, what are you afraid of." Under his control, many poor and lower-middle peasants could not get back their labor remuneration, while landlords, rich peasant elements, and wealthy middle peasants could get it back. The cooperative's financial accounts were only published once in two years. After these ugly facts were exposed, everyone realized that the cooperative system was good, and the cooperative was not run well because it was not well led. The Sanji Agricultural Cooperative initially grasped the renegade Zhang Liancheng's anti-Party behavior and debated the issue of whether or not to have Party leadership, which raised the masses' awareness.
　　In some places, on the contrary, they neither fully mobilized the masses to speak out freely nor conducted debates on the basis of the issues of greatest concern and interest to the masses through typical figures, but the work team formulated topics and discussed them one by one, resulting in a messy debate. These cooperatives are all large cooperatives with more than 300 to 500 households, and the problems are very complex, but they did not lead the masses to debate from the inside out and from point to surface according to this characteristic, but were eager to achieve success and universally launched the great debate all at once, so the problem was not solved deeply and thoroughly.
　　Distinguish Between Two Types of Contradictions and Determine Rectification Steps
　　In these weak agricultural cooperatives, contradictions between the enemy and ourselves and contradictions among the people are mixed together, and the reasons why the cooperatives are not run well are very complex. Therefore, in the process of the great blooming, great contending, we not only paid attention to distinguishing the boundaries between the reasons why the cooperatives were not run well and the socialist system, but also strictly drew a line between the contradictions between the enemy and ourselves and the contradictions among the people.
　　The general practice is to first carry out reasoning struggles against wealthy middle peasants with serious capitalist ideas and behaviors, and stop their illegal behaviors and harmful activities. The work team comrades all had individual talks with the wealthy middle peasants who were criticized, or held small heart-to-heart talks, explained the Party's consistent policy of uniting, educating, and transforming wealthy middle peasants, and pointed out the direction of their efforts.
　　The second step is to crack down on all kinds of demons and monsters. In this movement, the government arrested four people according to law; placed fifteen people under production control and re-labeled them as landlords and rich peasants; and only conducted struggles against eighty-five people at mass rallies without giving them punishment. When struggling against these demons and monsters, the masses did not allow them to argue, but asked them to confess their crimes in public and lower their heads to admit their guilt. As a result, some wealthy middle peasants who were criticized felt that everyone treated them differently from landlords and rich peasants, and they became closer to the Party and the poor peasants.
　　The third step, on the basis of the widespread improvement of mass awareness, through criticism and self-criticism, a "five checks" movement was launched among the cooperative cadres to check their concepts of the state, collective, masses, labor, and work responsibility; a "five comparisons" movement was launched among the cooperative members to compare their love for public property, the quality of their work, their labor attendance, their obedience to leadership, and their ideological progress. The cooperative cadres made inspections at certain meetings based on the criticisms made by the masses. In the "five checks" and "five comparisons" movement, a total of 367 model figures were commended, and 213 people were criticized. Finally, a "patriotic, cooperative-loving, family-loving public agreement" was formulated.
　　Further Rectify Cooperatives and Promote a Production Upsurge in Accordance with the Spirit of the Three Central Instructions
　　After the great debate came to an end, in accordance with the three instructions of the Central Committee on improving the work of agricultural cooperatives, and the rationalization proposals put forward by the cooperative members, the agricultural cooperatives were further rectified. The main problems solved were: the accounts were disclosed to the cooperative members in detail, the "three debts" were cleared up, and a financial system was established. Errors in violation of the mutual benefit policy were corrected, and the poor households were appropriately arranged. The cooperative's leadership structure was streamlined, the leadership composition of the cooperative and teams was adjusted, bad elements were removed, cooperative cadres with serious errors were replaced, and some outstanding individuals from the poor and lower-middle peasants were absorbed to participate in the cooperative's leadership work. A responsibility system was established in production management, and all cooperative cadres participated in production labor. At the same time as the cooperative rectification, the leadership of the branch was checked within the Party, and the right-leaning thoughts, commandism, and the tendency of disunity among the Party members were criticized. Ten Party members who violated laws and discipline were dealt with separately.
　　In the process of the all-people rectification campaign, attention was always paid to the combination with production. When the cooperative rectification work was about to end, a great debate on agricultural production and construction issues was conducted again, and a production plan for this winter and 1958 was formulated, thereby setting off an upsurge in production and construction.

　　从大鸣大放中整顿了薄弱社
    中共崞县县委会
    中共山西崞县县委为了推动薄弱社赶上先进社，在这次全民整风中，集中力量整顿了四十个薄弱社。
    这四十个农业社的情况虽然有所不同，但都具有共同的特点：（一）管理委员会和生产队的领导权，被地主、富农、富裕中农、商人和反革命分子所掌握，资本主义自发倾向严重。（二）地主富农分子、反革命分子和坏分子制造谣言、煽动闹事、反攻倒算、闹迷信、搞赌博进行破坏活动。（三）在这四十个社的六百八十名共产党员中间，立场坚定、工作积极的占40％；右倾思想严重、工作消极的占35％；资本主义思想严重、对党和国家政策表示怀疑和不满的占20％；其余5％的党员，违法乱纪，蜕化变质，有的还是混进党内的阶级异己分子。上社村党员王铁文就是一个典型的例子。他一贯进行投机倒把，大量套购国家物资。在大辩论过程中，从他家的地洞里发现的物资有：自行车二十一辆，各种布二百零六匹，粮食五十余石，白洋一百六十八元，还有麻皮、葫油、石油、食盐等大量的物资。他拥有万贯家私，还到处哭穷，故意蒸上糠窝窝让别人看，煽动社员闹粮闹社。（四）这些农业社的生产一般搞得不好，经营管理混乱，以三吉村农业社为例来说：这个社的粮食产量逐年下降，1955年亩产二百五十五斤，1956年二百三十三斤，今年是二百一十斤。减产的原因之一是经营管理混乱，劳动定额不合理。在今年抗旱斗争正紧张的时候，有一百二十三个社员在自留地里劳动，九十四人坐着不动，四十一人去东奔西跑抓现钱，在社里劳动的只有四十九人。农业社的五辆胶皮大车在外跑运输七个月，纯收入只有一千八百五十三元，不合理的开支就达一千零五十七元。财务账目没有按期公布，社员有六千多元的劳动收入领不回去；另一部分社员超支三千八百多元。社的四个主要干部长支款二百多元。社主任、会计等五个干部，七个月仅仅做下五个劳动日。
    这些农业社经过整顿以后，已经基本上改变了落后面貌。广大群众坚定了走社会主义道路的信心和决心，资本主义自发倾向大大克服；干部作风有了很大改进，改善了党群关系和干群关系，纯洁了党的队伍，巩固了合作社。从实际工作中训练了一百七十九名整社骨干。
    整顿薄弱社同样应该采用大辩论的方法
    在整社开始之初，县委对整顿薄弱社的艰苦程度估计不足，把参加整社的干部分散到九十二个农业社，要求在很短的时间内整好，结果走了弯路。县委接受了教训，将工作组集中到四十个薄弱社，要求以四十至六十天的时间，基本上把社整好。当时有少数干部听说要整顿薄弱社，就唉声叹气，缺乏信心。县委批判了这种错误思想，鼓舞了大家战胜困难的信心。
    工作组到村以后，有的同志看到一切都不顺眼，忽视采用大辩论的方法，企图用整一整、扣一扣的简单粗暴方法改造薄弱社。有一个农业社一下子就处罚了六十个人，有一个农民偷拿了社里的四个玉茭棒，就被罚款一百元。县委发现后，及时地制止了他们的这种错误做法。
    用阶级分析的方法挑选积极分子培养基本队伍
    整顿薄弱社光依靠领导机关派工作组去是不够的，必须组织一支以党团员和贫农、下中农中的积极分子为主的基本队伍。薄弱社之所以薄弱，正是缺乏这样一支强有力的队伍。在开展大辩论的前后，工作组用相当大的力量培养了积极分子一千六百人，对整社起了很大作用。工作组先向党、团员讲解了中央指示的精神，使他们明确了大辩论的目的，是要从思想上解决社会主义和资本主义两条道路谁胜谁负的问题。在这个基础之上，依靠基层党组织，用阶级分析的方法，对党内党外的思想动向作了分析，挑选了积极分子。社会主义的基本队伍初步的组织起来以后，采用“十看十比”的方法，从政治、生产、物质文化生活、社会风尚等方面，启发积极分子进行新旧社会对比。不少的人在回忆对比中，检查了右倾思想、糊涂观念，有的人痛哭流涕地检讨了自己的某些错误言论和忘本思想。经过教育，使积极分子辨明了是非，提高了觉悟，学会了领导群众大辩论的本领。下王村农业社的积极分子提出，在辩论中要注意“四要和四不要”，就是要讲道理，不要谩骂；只要动口，不要动手；要摆事实，不要说空话；要说在点子上，不要乱开腔。积极分子的思想认识统一以后，工作组向他们进一步交代了全民整风的方法、步骤，紧接着分头发动群众大鸣大放。
    薄弱社敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾都比较尖锐，资本主义思想突出，社员意见很多。在最初发动群众鸣放的时候，绝大多数人抱着观望的态度，看工作组是不是办事？会不会包庇有问题的人？如果把问题翻出来解决不了，反而自找苦头吃。开始鸣放，推来推去，发言的人，就尽说好事不说坏事，说过去的事不说现在的事，说社里的事不说国家大事，说空话不说具体问题。一部分富裕中农则在会外议论活动，鼓动群众，攻击党和社的领导。个别极端反动的分子，仍在继续进行破坏活动。那些有错误的社干部，害怕引火烧身，强调生产忙，没工夫鸣放。或者是光讲高级社的优越性，堵住社员的嘴。有的认为今年的庄稼长得好，只要能多打下粮食，就能交代，其它问题是淡事，没有辩头。
    针对上述情况，工作组除向群众报告了全民整风的重大意义外，立即着手处理了本社群众最关心的几个问题。例如在三吉农业社的工作组，首先帮助农业社安排了当前的生产，白天同社员在一起劳动，晚上处理问题。在几天的时间内，协同管理委员会解决了四个迫切问题。对那些有错误的社干部，动员他们主动“下楼”，向群众作检讨，表明对提了意见的人不打击报复。这样一来，群众纷纷反映说：“没有想到，上面派来六个人，给咱们办了天大的事。”接着就争先恐后地大鸣大放起来。为了让大家鸣透放尽，还先后分别召开了各种人的小型谈心会四十七次，同时通过个别访问和生产中的闲谈，收集了不少意见。
    为了扫除大鸣大放中的障碍，有些地方在群众的要求之下，及时地打击了敌人的破坏活动，使群众深深感到：大鸣大放是要发扬正气，压倒邪气，所以就毫无顾虑地把自己心里的话谈出来了。
    抓住大家最关心最有兴趣的问题，发动群众进行辩论
    在薄弱社组织大辩论，一开始就要抓住这个社存在的主要问题，通过典型人物，把辩论的中心引向两条道路的斗争上来。下孤薛农业社由于去年粮食减产和社员减少收入，地主富农分子和少数富裕中农抓住这个把柄，在鸣放阶段，大肆攻击合作化制度说：“去年灰，今年更灰，再不垮台，家家户户都得挨饿。”说社办不好是国家征购粮食多了。有少数群众也被他们的谬论所蒙蔽，盲目地跟上叫喊。其实国家征购的粮食是年年减少，1954年征购八十六万斤；1956年七十一万斤。去年每人平均分到粮食四百二十五斤。在辩论会上，用这些铁的事实驳倒了他们的谬论。接着大家找到了社办得不好的原因，是社的领导权被富农分子郑咸林（社主任）掌握了。他为了拆合作社的台，在锄苗紧张的季节，竟抽调大批社员修筑戏台围墙，结果耽误了锄苗。社里死了牲畜二十八头，他幸灾乐祸地说：“死了比不死强，死了有保险公司赔赏，怕什么。”在他把持之下，许多贫农和下中农领不回劳动报酬，而地主富农分子和富裕中农却能领回去。社里的财务账目，在二年的时间内，只公布过一次总数字。这些丑恶事实被揭露后，大家认识了合作化制度是好的，社办得不好是没领导好。三吉农业社一开始就抓住蜕化分子张连成的反党行为，辩论要不要党的领导的问题，提高了群众觉悟。
    有些地方恰恰相反，既没有充分发动群众大鸣大放，又没有根据群众最关心最有兴趣的问题，通过典型人物进行辩论，而是由工作组拟定题目，逐条讨论，结果乱辩了一顿。这些社都是三百户至五百户以上的大社，问题很复杂，但他们没有根据这个特点，由内而外、由点到面地领导群众辩论，而是急于求成，一下子就普遍展开大辩论，因而对问题解决的不深不透。
    区别两种矛盾，确定整改步骤
    在这些薄弱的农业社，敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾是混杂在一起的，社办得不好的原因是很复杂的。所以在大鸣大放大争的过程中，不仅注意了区别合作社办得不好的原因同社会主义制度的界限，而且严格地划清了敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾的界限。
    一般的做法是，首先对于具有严重资本主义思想和行为的富裕中农，进行说理斗争，制止他们的违法行为和有害活动。凡是受到批判的富裕中农，工作组的同志和他们都个别谈了话，或举行了小型谈心会，向他们讲解了党一贯团结、教育、改造富裕中农的方针，指出了努力的方向。
    第二步是打击各种牛鬼蛇神。在此次运动中，政府依法逮捕四人；管制生产和给重新戴上地主富农“帽子”的十五人；只在群众大会上进行了斗争而未给予处分的八十五人。在斗争这些牛鬼蛇神的时候，群众不允许他们争辩，要他们当众交代罪恶，低头认罪。这样一来，有些被批判的富裕中农，感到大家对待自己还是与地主富农大不相同，就更加靠拢了党和贫农。
    第三步，在群众觉悟普遍提高的基础上，通过批评与自我批评，在社干部中开展了查国家观念、集体观念、群众观念、劳动观念、工作责任心的“五查”运动；在社员中开展了比爱护公共财产、做活质量、劳动出勤、服从领导、思想进步的“五比”运动。社干部根据群众对自己提出的批评，在一定的会议上作了检查。在“五查”“五比”运动中，共表扬了模范人物三百六十七人，受到批评的二百一十三人。最后制定了“爱国爱社爱家公约”。
    按照中央三个指示的精神，进一步整顿合作社推进生产高潮
    大辩论告一段落后，遵照中央关于改进农业社工作的三个指示，和社员提出的合理化建议，进一步整顿了农业社。解决的主要问题是：向社员详细地公布了账目，清理了“三欠”，建立了财务制度。纠正了违反互利政策的错误，适当地安排了困难户。精简了社的领导机构，调整了社和队的领导成分，清除了坏分子，撤换了有严重错误的社干部，从贫农和下中农中吸收了一部分优秀分子参加了社的领导工作。在生产管理上建立了责任制度，社干部统统参加了生产劳动。与整社同时，在党内检查了支部的领导，批判了党员中的右倾思想、命令主义和不团结的倾向。违法乱纪的十名党员，分别作了处理。
    在全民整风的过程中，始终注意了同生产的结合。整社工作将要结束时，又进行了一次农业生产建设问题的大辩论，制定了今年冬季和1958年的生产计划，从而掀起了生产建设的高潮。
