　　Xinhua News Agency, Washington, December 29th: The U.S. State Department announced on the 28th that Secretary of State Dulles will lead a U.S. observer delegation to the fourth meeting of the Baghdad Pact Ministerial Council, to be held in Ankara, Turkey, from January 27th to January 30th. This is the first time Dulles has attended a meeting of the Baghdad Pact organization.
　　Although the United States has participated in the "Military Committee," "Anti-Subversion Committee," and "Economic Committee" of the Baghdad Pact organization, it has not yet participated in other bodies of the organization.
　　Dulles' decision to attend the Baghdad Pact organization meeting is to strengthen the ties between this organization and the North Atlantic Group. Prior to this, Dulles had met with the ambassadors to the United States from the Manila Pact Organization and the Organization of American States to discuss strengthening the ties between these two groups and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

    杜勒斯拉拢侵略伙计
    将出席巴格达集团会议
    据新华社29日讯 华盛顿消息：美国国务院28日宣布，国务卿杜勒斯将率领美国观察员代表团出席将从1月27日到1月30日在土耳其安卡拉召开的巴格达条约部长理事会第四次会议。这是杜勒斯第一次出席巴格达条约组织的会议。
    美国目前虽然参加了巴格达条约组织的“军事委员会”、“反颠覆委员会”和“经济委员会”，但是还没有参加这个组织的其他机构。
    杜勒斯决定出席巴格达条约组织会议，是为了加强这个组织同北大西洋集团的联系。在这以前，杜勒斯曾经会见马尼拉条约组织和美洲国家组织各国驻美使节，讨论关于加强这两个集团同北大西洋公约组织的联系。
