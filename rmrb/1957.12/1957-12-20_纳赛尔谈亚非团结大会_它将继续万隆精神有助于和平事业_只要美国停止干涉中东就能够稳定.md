Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, December 19th: Egyptian President Nasser pointed out to Romanian reporters in Cairo on December 14th that the upcoming Afro-Asian Solidarity Conference in Cairo is a continuation of the Bandung Conference. It will further strengthen the unity of Afro-Asian countries, make it possible for others to hear the voices of the Afro-Asian people, help the internal development of these countries, and promote the consolidation of peace.

The Romanian "Spark" newspaper published Nasser's remarks on the 18th. In his remarks, he also discussed the Middle East situation and Egypt's economic situation.

President Nasser said that Middle Eastern countries will not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and oppose any interference from the West. Any interference from Western countries will be opposed by Arab countries. Arab countries will not give up the struggle to achieve their ideals. He believes that if the United States stops opposing these countries' actions and allows these countries to be independent, a stable life will be established in the Middle East.

Nasser also said that the current goal of Arab countries is to unite. However, there are still many obstacles to achieving this goal, especially some personal differences among government leaders. Arab countries believe that their unity is a guarantee of economic development and political security. We hope to achieve unity in military, economic, and political terms.

Speaking about Egypt's economic situation, Nasser said that Egypt is an agricultural country, and now we want to turn it into an industrial and agricultural country. We are working hard to increase the yield per unit area of land. Nasser then spoke about Egypt's financial difficulties and introduced Egypt's economic construction plan.

    纳赛尔谈亚非团结大会
    它将继续万隆精神有助于和平事业
    只要美国停止干涉中东就能够稳定
    据新华社布加勒斯特19日电　埃及总统纳赛尔12月14日在开罗对罗马尼亚记者指出，即将在开罗举行的亚非团结大会是万隆会议的继续。它将进一步加强亚非各国的团结，将使别人有可能听到亚非人民的声音，将帮助这些国家内部的发展，并且将促进和平的巩固。
    罗马尼亚“火花报”18日发表了纳赛尔的谈话，他在谈话中还谈到中东局势和埃及经济情况等问题。
    纳赛尔总统说，中东国家将不干涉其他国家的任何内政，也反对来自西方的任何干涉，西方国家的任何干涉都会遇到阿拉伯国家的反对。阿拉伯国家不会放弃为实现它们的理想的斗争。他认为，如果美国停止反对这些国家的行动，让这些国家独立，在中东就会建立稳定的生活。
    纳赛尔又说，目前阿拉伯国家的目的是团结一致。但是要实现这一目的还有许多阻碍，特别是在政府领导人之间还有些个人的不同意见。阿拉伯各国认为它们的团结是经济发展和政治安全的保障。我们希望实现在军事、经济和政治上的团结一致。
    在谈到埃及的经济情况时，纳赛尔说，埃及是一个农业国，现在我们想把它变为工业农业国。我们正在努力提高土地单位面积的产量。纳赛尔随后又谈到埃及的财政困难，并且介绍了埃及的经济建设计划。
