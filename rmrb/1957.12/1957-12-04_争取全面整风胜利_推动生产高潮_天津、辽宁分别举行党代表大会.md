　　Strive for a Comprehensive Rectification Victory and Promote a Production Upsurge
　  Tianjin and Liaoning Hold Party Congresses Separately
    According to Xinhua News Agency, the Second Session of the Second Tianjin Municipal Congress of the Communist Party of China concluded on the afternoon of November 30.

    The central topic of the meeting was how to continue to carry out a nationwide rectification movement. The meeting believed that the current task of the rectification movement is to resolutely and thoroughly rectify and reform. The first and second batches of units in the city undergoing rectification have achieved certain results after entering the stage of focusing on rectification and reform. For example, the number of cadres who have been transferred to labor and production posts has reached 32,000, of which 12,000 have been transferred to rural areas. However, the entire rectification and reform work is only just beginning. The meeting emphasized that rectification and reform is the main link in this rectification movement and must be implemented to the end. Firmly believing in the majority of the masses and continuing to mobilize the masses to speak out freely, debate extensively, and contend thoroughly are the keys to doing a good job in rectification and reform. Secondly, in order to make rectification and reform effective, leading cadres must also take action themselves and concentrate their efforts to solve the key problems of their own units. From the perspective of the whole city, the focus of rectification and reform should be on: the implementation of the Party and the state's policies and guidelines, the issue of leadership style and the relationship between the Party and the masses, and the issue of streamlining institutions and transferring cadres. Various departments should determine different priorities according to their specific circumstances, find fundamental problems from the large number of opinions put forward by the masses, and organize forces to study and solve them. Thirdly, leading cadres facing up to their own shortcomings and mistakes and making open and sincere self-criticisms to the masses is a major part of doing a good job in rectification and reform. The meeting also pointed out that the principle of seeking truth from facts must be grasped in the rectification and reform. When carrying out rectification and reform vigorously, we must act in accordance with the Party and the state's policies and guidelines. For problems that should be changed and must be resolutely changed, we must also earnestly implement the principle of building the country diligently and thriftily, running enterprises diligently and thriftily, and running all undertakings diligently and thriftily, and strive to spend no money or spend as little money as possible.

    Regarding how to continue to implement the nationwide rectification movement in the future, the meeting believed that we have a large number of cadres who are intellectuals who have not been transformed. Therefore, strengthening the transformation of intellectuals should become the center of the nationwide rectification. The key issue in transforming intellectuals is to implement the policy of unified arrangement and comprehensive transformation, and to transfer cadres to industrial and agricultural production labor in a planned way. However, the transfer of cadres should start from the positive significance – training cadres and changing the social atmosphere – and should not be based on the idea of unloading burdens. The meeting also pointed out that it is necessary to take various effective measures to cultivate the working class's own professors, doctors, engineers, scientists, writers, journalists, and Marxist-Leninist theorists in an organized and planned way, and strive to establish a contingent of working-class intellectuals within about ten years. The key to realizing the above measures lies in strengthening the Party's leadership over cultural and educational undertakings. Cadres engaged in cultural and educational work should study their professions diligently and cultivate themselves into cadres who are both professionally proficient and politically red. They should also further strengthen the cadres in cultural and educational departments and develop a group of tested intellectuals to join the Party, so as to truly grasp the leadership in professional work.

    The meeting believed that a profound socialist ideological education must be carried out among workers, farmers, students, small and medium-sized industrial and commercial households, handicraftsmen, and street residents.

    The meeting called on the entire Party to take action, redouble its efforts, and overcome the mistakes of subjectivism, bureaucratism, and sectarianism with a serious and earnest attitude, improve all aspects of work, in order to achieve a complete victory in the movement. The meeting called on the entire Party to continue to implement the policy of "rectification and production are both correct" while vigorously rectifying and reforming, and to have full ideological and organizational preparations to welcome the new and unprecedented production upsurge that is bound to come and has already begun with the rectification movement, so as to achieve brilliant achievements on the economic front after the start of the Second Five-Year Plan.

    The meeting implemented the spirit of great airing of views and great contending, and carried out criticism and self-criticism.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, the Second Session of the First Liaoning Provincial Congress of the Communist Party of China was held from November 22 to 28. The meeting called on all Party members and the people of the province to strive for a complete victory in the rectification movement with indomitable spirit, and on this basis, to promote the upsurge of increasing production and practicing economy on the industrial front and the great leap forward in agricultural production and construction.

    The meeting believed that the achievements of Liaoning Province in various tasks in the past year have been tremendous. The development of the rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle is normal and healthy, and has already achieved significant results on the political and ideological fronts. The total industrial output value of the province is expected to exceed the 27% stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan by the end of the year. Especially after the rectification and socialist education movement was carried out in industrial and mining enterprises, the enthusiasm of workers and staff for production has generally increased, and a new upsurge in production and construction has arrived. On the agricultural front, it is expected that more than 99% of peasant households in the province will have joined cooperatives by the end of the year, and all have already achieved advanced cooperativization. In particular, since the socialist education movement was launched in rural areas, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of farmers has greatly improved, the socialist position in rural areas has been further consolidated, and a better foundation has been laid for striving for a bumper harvest next year and a great leap forward in agricultural construction.

    The meeting believed that the current task of the rectification movement in Liaoning Province is to do a good job in rectification and reform with all its strength. The key lies in the leadership having a deep understanding of rectification and reform, having the determination to rectify and reform, seeking truth from facts, and earnestly following the mass line. Streamlining institutions and transferring cadres is an important part of rectification. At present, streamlining institutions and transferring cadres has initially formed an upsurge in the province. As of November 26, more than 23,000 people have been transferred in two batches.

    The meeting pointed out that Liaoning Province is one of China's heavy industrial bases. In the Second Five-Year Plan, it must make full use of the existing industrial equipment capacity, work hard to do a good job in new construction and expansion projects, and vigorously tap potential to give full play to the role of the industrial base. Regarding rural work, the meeting pointed out that it is necessary to carry out a good socialist great debate, comprehensively discuss the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), and formulate specific plans in combination with local conditions to ensure that agricultural cooperatives in the province reach the production level of well-to-do middle peasants within three years; strive to achieve self-sufficiency in grain during the Second Five-Year Plan period; self-sufficiency in vegetables next year, and self-sufficiency in pork the year after next.

　　争取全面整风胜利　推动生产高潮
　  天津、辽宁分别举行党代表大会
    据新华社讯　中共天津市第二届代表大会第二次会议在11月30日下午闭幕。
    会议的中心议题是如何继续开展全民性的整风运动。会议认为，当前整风运动的任务是要坚决地、狠狠地整改。全市第一、二批整风单位在进入着重整改阶段后，已经取得一定成绩，例如目前下放到劳动生产岗位的干部已达三万二千人，其中有一万二千人下放到农村。但是整个整改工作还只是开始。会议强调指出：整改工作是这次整风运动的主要环节，必须贯彻到底。而坚定地相信群众的多数，继续发动群众大鸣大放、大争大辩，是作好整改工作的关键。其次，要使整改工作行之有效，领导干部还必须亲自动手，集中力量解决本单位的关键问题。从全市范围来看，整改工作的重点应是：对党和国家的政策方针的执行问题，领导作风和党与群众的关系的问题，紧缩机构与下放干部问题等。各部门应该根据自己的具体情况确定不同的重点，在群众提出的大量意见中找出带有根本性的问题，组织力量研究解决。第三，领导干部正视自己的缺点和错误，公开诚恳地向群众进行检查，是做好整改工作的主要一环。会议还指出，在整改中还必须掌握实事求是的原则，在雷厉风行地进行整改时，必须按照党和国家的方针政策办事。对于应改而必须坚决地改的问题，也必须认真执行勤俭建国、勤俭办企业、勤俭办一切事业的原则，尽量做到不花钱或少花钱。
    对于今后如何继续贯彻全民性的整风运动，会议认为，我们有大量的干部是没有经过改造的知识分子，因而加强知识分子的改造，应成为全民整风的中心。改造知识分子的关键问题是贯彻统一安排、全面改造的方针，有计划地把干部下放到工农业中去生产劳动。但是，下放干部应从积极的意义——锻炼干部、改变社会风气出发，而不能存着卸包袱的思想。会议还指出：必须采取各种有效措施，有组织、有计划地培养工人阶级自己的教授、医师、工程师、科学家、文学家、记者和马列主义理论家，争取在十年左右的时间内建立一支工人阶级自己的知识分子队伍。实现上述措施的关键在于加强党对文教事业的领导。做文教工作的干部要刻苦学习业务，把自己培养成又专又红的干部；还要进一步加强文教部门的干部，发展一批经过考验的知识分子入党，以便把业务上的领导权确实掌握起来。
    会议认为：在工人、农民、学生、中小工商户、手工业者和街道居民中，都必须进行一次深刻的社会主义的思想教育。
    会议号召全党动手、加倍努力，以认真严肃的态度，切切实实地克服主观主义、官僚主义、宗派主义的错误，改进各方面的工作，以求得运动的全胜。会议号召全党在大力整改的同时，继续贯彻整风生产两不误的方针。并有充分的思想准备和组织准备，迎接随着整风运动必然到来并且已经开始出现的新的规模空前的生产高潮，以便在第二个五年计划开始后在经济战线上也取得光辉的成就。
    会议贯彻了大鸣大放的精神，开展了批评与自我批评。
    据新华社讯　中共辽宁省第一届代表大会第二次会议11月22日到28日举行。这次会议号召全省党员和全省人民用坚毅不挠的精神争取整风运动的全胜，在这一基础上推进工业战线上的增产节约高潮和农业生产建设的大跃进。
    会议认为，这一年来辽宁省各项工作的成绩是巨大的。整风运动和反右派斗争的发展是正常的、健康的，并且已经在政治战线和思想战线上取得了显著的成效。全省的工业总产值预计到年底将超过第一个五年计划规定的27％，特别是在工矿企业开展整风和社会主义教育运动以后，职工生产积极性普遍高涨，生产建设的新高潮已经到来。在农业战线上，预计到年底全省入社农户将达到99％以上，并且已经全部高级合作化。特别是农村展开社会主义教育运动以来，广大农民的社会主义觉悟有很大提高，农村的社会主义阵地已经更加巩固，更好地打下了争取明年大丰收、农业建设大跃进的基础。
    会议认为，辽宁省整风运动的当前任务是全力搞好整改。其关键在于领导上对整改有深刻的认识，有整改的决心，实事求是，并且认真地走群众路线。紧缩机构、下放干部，是整风的一个重要内容。目前全省紧缩机构、下放干部已初步形成热潮，到11月26日止，全省前后两批已下放了二万三千多人。
    会议指出，辽宁省是我国重工业基地之一，在第二个五年计划中必须充分利用现在工业设备能力，努力作好新建和扩建工程，大力挖掘潜力，以充分发挥工业基地的作用。关于农村工作，会议指出要搞好社会主义大辩论，全面地讨论全国农业发展纲要（修正草案），并结合当地情况制定出具体规划，保证全省农业社在三年内达到富裕中农的生产水平；力争第二个五年计划时期内达到粮食自给；明年蔬菜自给，后年猪肉自给。
