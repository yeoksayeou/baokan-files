Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 14th. TASS reports: To celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of Soviet trade unions, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, chaired by Voroshilov, awarded the Order of Lenin to Soviet trade unions on the 13th, in recognition of their outstanding achievements in socialist construction and their important educational role as a school of communism. The awarding ceremony was solemnly held at the plenary session of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions in the Hall of Columns of the Trade Union Building in Moscow.

    Voroshilov spoke at the meeting. He said that the Communist Party requires trade union organizations to organize the working people, educate the working people, teach them to manage production, teach them to participate in the management of the state, and cultivate conscious Soviet workers—builders of communism. The Communist Party connects with the broadest masses of workers and staff through trade unions.

    He expressed the hope that Soviet trade unions will most actively publicize the two declarations of the Moscow Conference.

    On the same day, Voroshilov also awarded orders and medals to a large number of trade union activists and trade union workers.

    社会主义建设中功绩卓著
    苏联工会获列宁勋章
    据新华社14日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：为了庆祝苏联工会成立五十年，苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫13日授予苏联工会列宁勋章，以表彰它在社会主义建设中的卓越功绩和作为共产主义学校所起的重要教育作用。授勋的仪式在莫斯科工会大厦圆柱大厅全苏工会中央理事会全体会议上隆重举行。
    伏罗希洛夫在会上讲了话。他说，共产党要求工会组织劳动人民，教育劳动人民，教他们管理生产，教他们参加管理国家，培养自觉的苏维埃劳动者——共产主义建设者。共产党是通过工会来联系最广泛的职工群众的。
    他希望，苏联工会要最积极地宣传莫斯科会议的两项宣言。
    同一天，伏罗希洛夫还授给一大批工会积极分子和工会工作者以勋章和奖章。
