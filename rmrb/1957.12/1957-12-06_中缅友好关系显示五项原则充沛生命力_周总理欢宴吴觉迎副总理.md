Xinhua News Agency, December 5th – Sino-Burmese Friendly Relations Display the Abundant Vitality of the Five Principles.

Premier Zhou Hosts a Banquet for Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein

According to Xinhua News Agency on the 5th, Premier Zhou Enlai held a banquet in Beijing on the evening of the 5th to welcome Burmese Federation Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein and his wife, as well as all members of the Burmese goodwill economic delegation.

Premier Zhou Enlai, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, warmly welcomed the distinguished Burmese guests. In his speech at the banquet, he first spoke of the traditional friendship between China and Burma, which has seen significant development on a new basis. Burma was one of the first countries to recognize our country and has consistently advocated for the restoration of China's position in the United Nations, as well as the effective cooperation that the two countries have engaged in to safeguard international peace and security and to promote the unity of Asian and African countries.

Premier Zhou emphasized that China, Burma, and India jointly initiated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Over the past few years, our two governments have followed these principles, leading to the satisfactory resolution of many issues, thereby demonstrating the abundant vitality of the Five Principles. We firmly believe that the friendly relations between the two countries, built on the basis of the Five Principles, will become increasingly consolidated and developed.

Premier Zhou affirmed that the visit of the Burmese goodwill economic delegation led by Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein to our country will greatly help promote mutual understanding and friendship between the two countries, and promote economic ties and exchange of experiences between the two countries. This will also be an important contribution to the implementation of the Bandung Conference resolution on developing economic cooperation among Asian and African countries.

In his speech, Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein said that he brought the warm congratulations of the Burmese people to Premier Zhou Enlai and the Chinese people. He also said that although it has only been a few years since China's liberation and Burma's independence, the traditional friendship between the two countries has developed unprecedentedly, and this friendship is now on the path of consolidation and durability.

Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein emphasized that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are the best principles for guiding international relations. Burma has always adhered to and faithfully implemented these five principles in the past, and will continue to strictly abide by and faithfully implement them in the future. He also said that through the continued implementation of the Five Principles, the kinship-like relationship between China and Burma will be strengthened day by day and achieve unprecedented development. Finally, Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein suggested that Burma and China should send more delegations to visit each other, exchange knowledge and conduct technical cooperation, understand each other and help each other.

After the speeches by Premier Zhou Enlai and Deputy Prime Minister U Kyaw Nyein, the orchestra played the national anthems of Burma and China.

A reception was held before the banquet. At the reception, the distinguished Burmese guests were accompanied by Premier Zhou and others, and were introduced to meet with our national and government leaders and representatives from all walks of life.

Attending tonight's banquet and reception were Vice Premiers He Long, Chen Yi, and Li Fuchun; Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee Li Jishen, Huang Yanpei, and Peng Zhen; Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Zhang Zhizhong; Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the CPPCC Bao Erhan; Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Wentian; President of the Sino-Burmese Friendship Association Zheng Zhenduo; as well as heads of various departments of our government, people's organizations, and representatives from all walks of life in the capital.
