On the occasion of the historic Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, please allow me, on behalf of the Ceylon Federation of Trade Unions and all its members, to extend the warmest fraternal greetings to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and all the working people of China. Let me express my gratitude to you for inviting the Ceylon Federation of Trade Unions to participate in this great congress.

In addition to our Ceylon Federation of Trade Unions, all trade union organizations and working people in our country are pleased with the achievements of the Chinese working people, especially the successful completion of the first Five-Year Plan for national construction.

I had the honor of attending the Seventh National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions held in 1953. At that congress, representatives of the Chinese working masses discussed the first Five-Year Plan. After listening to the reports of this congress, I found that the first Five-Year Plan had been overfulfilled, which laid a preliminary foundation for building a strong industrial country. You are now ready to carry out the second Five-Year Plan for socialist construction.

The liberation of the Chinese people from the shackles of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and their embarkation on the road of socialism and peace, has greatly promoted the national liberation movements in Asia and other continents.

In 1949, the year your country was liberated, the Asian-Australasian Trade Union Conference was held in this great city of Beijing. The Ceylon Federation of Trade Unions had a representative who attended that meeting. Many Asian and Australian trade unions benefited from that meeting.

Between 1949 and 1950, when American monopoly capitalists bought our rubber for four shillings and five cents a pound and sold us rotten rice at high prices, our country faced great hardship and economic bankruptcy.

Because American monopoly capital acquired rubber at below-cost prices, rubber plantation owners cut the wages of rubber workers and closed rubber plantations, causing thousands of workers to lose their jobs.

At that time, the Ceylon Trade Unions launched a strike movement demanding the restoration of original wages and opposing the plunder of our country by American monopoly capitalists. The Ceylon Federation of Trade Unions and other trade union organizations demanded that the Ceylon government contact the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries in order to sell rubber at higher prices. The wave of strikes on rubber plantations enabled the Ceylon government to obtain higher rubber prices from American monopoly capitalists. The trade unions were not satisfied with increasing the price by this amount. They conducted a more determined movement. In 1952, the then Ceylon government signed an agreement with the government of the People's Republic of China, under which China would purchase all the crepe rubber produced by Ceylon each year, and Ceylon would purchase 275,000 tons of rice from China each year. In this way, Ceylon could sell rubber at a more reasonable price and also obtain better quality rice. As a result of extending this agreement year after year, the rubber industry and rubber workers have benefited greatly. This year, in order to help the Ceylon government implement the rubber plantation replanting subsidy plan, the Chinese government has provided substantial economic assistance.

Our people are very grateful for the help you have given us and regard your country as our best ally. This friendship was fully demonstrated when Premier Zhou Enlai visited Ceylon in the first half of this year. Even the capitalist newspapers in the country admitted that never in the history of Ceylon had a foreigner received such a warm welcome as the Chinese Premier.

When the delegation of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions visited our country in March this year, all the trade unions in our country expressed a warm welcome. Welcome meetings were held for this delegation throughout the country. Due to the establishment of diplomatic relations and the frequent exchange of delegations, the friendly relations between our two countries have been further strengthened.

Our trade unions and working people are watching with great care the great progress your country has made in all fields.

The various Ceylon delegations that have visited your country at various times have been deeply impressed by the tremendous progress you have made in such a short period of time.

The rapid progress your country has made in eliminating illiteracy and raising the cultural level of the people is astonishing. The great care your government gives to children is another thing that has made a very deep impression on those who have visited your country. Even the enemies of socialism admit that the speed of overall progress achieved by your country in such a short period of time is rare in world history.

You, the Chinese people, who make up a quarter of humanity, have embarked on the road of socialism and peace, which has changed the balance of power in the world in favor of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

The Fourth World Trade Union Congress, held in Leipzig in October this year, was attended by representatives of 105 million workers, accounting for 65% of the organized workers in the world. The conference unanimously passed a resolution to oppose colonialism and monopoly capital, strive for national independence, improve living conditions, and strive for democracy and social progress for the people of the world.

At the celebration of the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution last month, the Soviet Union showed the world its ability to defend its own territory, defend world peace, and oppose any aggressor. The launch of artificial satellites and the great progress in science and technology have frightened the American warmongers.

All of this shows that the powerful forces of socialism and peace, which have replaced capitalism in one-third of the earth, are moving towards a new stage in human history, towards the historical task of replacing the decadent capitalist era with the era of socialism and communism.

    锡兰工会联合会主席曼迪斯致词
    值此历史性的中国工会第八次全国代表大会开会的时候，请允许我代表锡兰工会联合会和它的全体会员，向中华全国总工会和全中国劳动人民致以最热烈的兄弟的敬礼。让我对你们邀请锡兰工会联合会参加这次伟大的代表大会，表示感谢。
    除了我们锡兰工会联合会之外，我国所有的工会组织和全体劳动人民都对中国劳动人民的成就，特别是对国家建设的第一个五年计划的胜利完成，感到高兴。
    我很荣幸地参加了在1953年举行的中国工会第七次全国代表大会。在那次大会上，中国工人群众的代表们讨论了第一个五年计划。在我听过这次代表大会的报告以后，我发现第一个五年计划已经超额完成了，这为建设一个强大的工业国家打下了初步基础。你们现在已经为进行社会主义建设的第二个五年计划作好了准备。
    中国人民从帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的枷锁中解放出来，走上了社会主义与和平的道路，这大大推动了亚洲和其他各洲的民族解放运动。
    在1949年，你们国家获得解放的一年，在这个伟大的城市——北京召开了亚洲澳洲工会会议。我们锡兰工会联合会有一个代表参加了那次会议。很多亚洲和澳洲的工会受到那次会议的好处。
    在1949年到1950年期间，当美国垄断资本家们以四角五分美金一磅的价钱买我们的橡胶，并且以高价卖给我们霉烂了的大米时，我们国家面临着重大的苦难和经济破产。
    由于美国垄断资本以低于成本的价钱收购橡胶，橡胶园主就削减橡胶工人的工资和关闭橡胶园，造成成千的工人失业。
    那时锡兰工会开展了罢工运动，要求恢复原有工资，反对美国垄断资本家掠夺我们的国家。锡兰工会联合会和其他工会组织要求锡兰政府与苏联、中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家接洽，以便以较高的价格卖出橡胶。橡胶园的罢工浪潮使锡兰政府从美国垄断资本家那里获得了较高的橡胶卖价。工会对增加这一点售价并不满意。它们进行了一个更坚决的运动。在1952年，当时的锡兰政府与中华人民共和国政府签订了协议，中国每年购买锡兰生产的全部烟胶片，锡兰则每年从中国购买二十七万五千吨大米。这样，锡兰可以用较合理的价格卖出橡胶，也可以得到质量较好的大米。这一协议一年年延长的结果，橡胶工业和橡胶工人得到很大的好处。今年，为了帮助锡兰政府执行橡胶园翻种补贴计划，中国政府给予了大量经济援助。
    我国人民非常感谢你们给我们的帮助，并且将你们国家当作我们最好的盟友。当今年上半年周恩来总理访问锡兰时，这种友谊充分表现出来了。连国内的资本主义报纸都承认，在锡兰历史上对外国人从来没有像对中国总理这样热烈欢迎过。
    当中华全国总工会代表团今年3月访问我国时，我国所有的工会都表示了热烈欢迎。全国各地都为这个代表团举行了欢迎会。由于建立外交关系和经常交换代表团，我们两国之间的友谊关系更进一步加强了。
    我国工会和劳动人民以极大的关怀注视着你们国家在所有各方面获得的伟大进步。
    在各个时期访问过你们国家的各个锡兰代表团对你们在这样短的时期内获得这样巨大的进步，都有很深刻的印象。
    你们国家在扫除文盲和提高人民文化水平方面的迅速进步是惊人的。你们政府给予儿童极大的关怀，这是使得到过你们国家访问的人获得极深刻印象的另外一件事情。连社会主义的敌人都承认，你们国家在这样短的时期内所达到的全面进步的速度，在世界历史上是少有的。
    你们，占全人类四分之一的中国人民，走上了社会主义与和平的道路，使世界上的力量对比起了对以苏联为首的社会主义阵营有利的变化。
    今年10月在来比锡举行的世界工会第四次代表大会，有代表一亿零五百万工人的代表参加，占全世界有组织工人的65％。大会全体一致地通过了决定，要反对殖民主义和垄断资本、争取民族独立、改善生活条件、争取全世界人民的民主和社会进步。
    在上个月举行的庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年纪念时，苏联将它所拥有的保卫自己的国土、保卫世界和平、反对任何侵略者的能力显示给了全世界。人造卫星的发射和科学技术的伟大进步已经吓坏了美国的战争贩子。
    所有这些，都表示出在地球上三分之一的地方代替了资本主义的社会主义与和平的强大力量，正在向着人类历史的新阶段，向着以社会主义和共产主义时代代替腐朽的资本主义时代的历史任务前进。
