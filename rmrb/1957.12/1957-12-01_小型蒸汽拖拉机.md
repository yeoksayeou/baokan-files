    Small Steam Tractor
    The Shenyang Agricultural Machinery Factory is stepping up the design of a ten-horsepower small steam tractor.
    This small tractor can drive water pumps, waterwheels, threshers, and chaff cutters, and can also pull carts and cultivate land. Its fuel can be based on local production, and it can use coal, firewood, sorghum stalks, and rice straw. It is very easy to operate.
    This cheap and practical small tractor is expected to be trial-produced before National Day next year.

    小型蒸汽拖拉机
    沈阳农业机械厂正在加紧设计一种十马力小型蒸汽拖拉机。
    这种小型拖拉机，既能带动抽水机、水车、脱谷机、铡草机，又能拉车和耕作；它的燃料可以根据当地的出产，使用煤、劈柴、秫秸、稻草均可；操纵它非常容易。
    这种便宜适用的小型拖拉机预计明年国庆节前可以试制出来。
