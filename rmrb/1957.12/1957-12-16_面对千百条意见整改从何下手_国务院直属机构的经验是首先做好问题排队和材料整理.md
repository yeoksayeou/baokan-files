Xinhua News Agency, December 15th: How to Start Rectification When Faced with Thousands of Opinions: The Experience of Institutions Directly Under the State Council is to First Sort Problems and Organize Materials.

　　Among the nineteen institutions directly under the State Council, fourteen have already entered the climax of concentrated rectification, except for a few that have not yet started or are in the process of starting rectification. In the past two weeks, these units have processed more than 60% of the more than 21,300 opinions raised by the masses during the airing of views, and it is expected that by around the 18th, most units will be able to process more than 80% of the opinions raised by the masses, and the general rectification can be concluded.

　　In the initial days of transitioning to concentrated rectification, each unit went through a period of exploration to determine where to start when faced with the thousands of opinions raised by the masses. Practice has proven that carefully classifying and prioritizing the opinions and problems raised by the masses is one of the important links for smoothly carrying out concentrated rectification. Some units were able to quickly classify the opinions raised by the masses according to their nature, distinguish between the primary and secondary, identify the sesame seeds and watermelons, and formulate a procedure for solving problems based on the method of easy before difficult. The leaders were then clear about the situation, and the problems were solved more and faster. However, there were also individual units where materials piled up, action was taken late, and the sorting work could not keep up with the needs of rectification. Sesame seeds and watermelons were grabbed together, or sesame seeds were regarded as watermelons, and watermelons were regarded as sesame seeds, which inevitably affected the speed of rectification. Therefore, the sorting of problems and the organization of materials should not be regarded merely as technical work, but it should be seen that it is mainly the leader's specific combat deployment.

　　In the process of organizing materials, for problems of the same nature, it is necessary to conduct comprehensive analysis, first concentrate them into several main problems, and then study the solutions in a unified manner, instead of dealing with each case separately and answering each item one by one. For example, the masses in the Bureau of Government Offices Administration raised hundreds of opinions on food. After research, they can be merged into three items, namely, the service personnel have a bad attitude, the variety of dishes is not adjusted enough, and the cooks still have opinions on the use of the card system. The leaders conducted research on the above three opinions, formulated specific improvement measures, and announced them to everyone, and the problem was basically solved. On the other hand, for some specific problems, such as broken doors and windows that need to be repaired, and too many subscriptions to newspapers and magazines that cause waste, if they should be changed, specific measures should be taken to solve them quickly, and should not be delayed.

　　In the climax of concentrated rectification, the ways in which leaders and the masses combine are diverse in various directly subordinate units. The Second and Fifth Offices, the Legislative Affairs Bureau, the Archives Bureau, the Written Language Reform Committee, and the General Office have all organized rectification teams for various special issues, absorbing relevant personnel and activists to participate, assisting leaders in soliciting opinions from the masses, and researching and proposing specific rectification plans. China International Travel Service adopted the method of selecting two representatives from each rectification study group to participate in the enlarged meeting of the agency's rectification leading group to jointly study and solve problems in rectification. The specific plan for preparation for change proposed by the enlarged meeting of the leading group was widely solicited from the masses in the form of a communiqué. Two days later, if everyone had no different opinions, it was considered final and then implemented. The Bureau of Government Offices Administration, with the leading group as the core, absorbed the heads of various sections (offices) and representatives of activists to participate and established a rectification committee, and each section (office) also established a rectification team accordingly. The problems aired were then used to establish twenty-seven rectification working groups according to their nature, absorbing relevant personnel from all aspects and activists to participate, jointly researching and proposing rectification plans, which were submitted to the leading group for research and decision after general discussion by the masses, and announced to the masses.

　　However, individual units have not paid attention to mobilizing the masses, so that everyone can use their brains and hands to engage in rectification, forming a phenomenon that leaders are rectifying behind closed doors, and the masses are idle and have nothing to do. Some masses criticized them as "people who do not see the sun." For the problems that have been changed, attention should be paid to using various methods such as big-character posters, report meetings, and broadcasts to publicize and promote them to the masses in a timely manner.

　　The experience of various units has also proved that in order to make the rectification work fast and good, the leadership must be determined and make every effort. It is necessary to have both a comprehensive battle plan and principled instructions, and specific methods and measures; it is necessary to be able to deeply explore specific problems, and to be able to grasp the essence through the phenomenon of problems, avoiding solving problems piecemeal. For each problem, a special person or special agency should be designated to be responsible for handling it in batches and within a limited time, and it should be checked at any time, so as to ensure that everything is taken care of and everything is accounted for.

　　Now, the units in the institutions directly under the State Council where the climax of concentrated rectification has passed are conducting a review of the quality of rectification. The next step is to first carry out the work of cadres being sent to lower levels, and then enter the stage of in-depth airing of views and in-depth rectification on special topics.

### 面对千百条意见整改从何下手  国务院直属机构的经验是首先做好问题排队和材料整理

　　面对千百条意见整改从何下手
    国务院直属机构的经验是首先做好问题排队和材料整理
    据新华社15日讯　国务院直属机构十九个单位中，除了少数单位尚未或者正在开始进入整改以外，有十四个单位都已经进入集中整改的高潮。两个星期以来，这些单位已经将鸣放中群众提出的二万一千三百多条意见处理了60％以上，预计到18日左右，大多数单位都可以将群众所提的意见处理到80％以上，可以结束一般整改。
    在转入集中整改的最初几天，面对群众所提出的千百条意见究竟应该从何处下手，各单位都经过了一段摸索的过程。实践证明，首先认真做好对群众提出的意见、问题的分类、排队工作是顺利开展集中整改的重要环节之一。有的单位由于能比较迅速地将群众提出的意见按性质分门别类进行排队，分清主次，识别出芝麻和西瓜，并根据先易后难的方法，订出解决问题的程序，领导就做到了心中有数，解决问题也就较多、较快。但也有个别单位，材料成堆，动手较晚，整理工作赶不上整改的需要，芝麻、西瓜一把抓，或是将芝麻看成了西瓜，将西瓜看成了芝麻，就势必影响整改的速度。因此，对问题排队、材料整理不能仅仅看成是技术性的工作，应该看到，主要是领导上具体作战的部署。
    在材料整理过程中，对同类性质的问题，必须经过综合分析，先集中成为几个主要问题，再统一研究解决的办法，不要就事论事，逐条答复。例如机关事务管理局群众对伙食提了好几百条意见，经过研究，可以归并成三条，即服务人员态度不好，菜的花样调剂不够和炊事员对使用卡片制度还有意见。领导上针对上述三条意见进行了研究，订出了具体的改进办法，向大家公布，问题也就基本上解决了。另一方面，对于有些具体问题，如门窗坏了需要修理，书报杂志订得太多有浪费现象等问题，凡是应该改的就应该采取具体办法，迅速解决，不宜迟缓。
    各直属单位在集中整改高潮中，领导和群众相结合的方式是多种多样的。第二、第五办公室、法制局、档案局、文字改革委员会、秘书厅等单位都组织了各种专门问题的整改小组，吸收有关人员和积极分子参加，协助领导征求群众意见，研究并提出整改的具体方案。国际旅行社采取了由各整风学习小组选派两名代表参加社整风领导小组扩大会议的方式，共同研究和解决整改中的问题。领导小组扩大会议提出的准备改的具体方案，以公报形式广泛征求群众意见，两天后大家没有不同意见，就算定案，然后付诸实施。机关事务管理局以领导小组为核心吸收各处（室）负责人和积极分子代表参加，成立了整改委员会，各处（室）也相应地成立了整改小组。又将鸣放的问题按性质成立了二十七个整改工作小组，吸收各方面的有关人员和积极分子参加，共同研究提出整改方案，经群众普遍讨论后，再提交领导小组研究决定，并向群众公布。
    但是有个别单位由于领导上没注意发动群众，使人人都来动脑、动手搞整改，形成了领导关门整改，群众都闲着没有事干的现象。有的群众批评他们是“不见阳光的人”。对于已经改了的问题，应该注意要尽量利用大字报、报告会、广播等各种方式，及时向群众公布和宣传。
    各单位的经验还证明，要使整改工作搞得既快又好，领导必须下决心、出全力。既要有全面的战斗部署和原则指示，又要有具体的办法和措施；既要能够深入摸具体问题，又要能够透过问题的现象抓住本质，避免枝枝节节地解决问题。对每一个问题，要指定专人或专门机构分层分批限定时间负责处理，并且要随时检查，这样才能保证事事有着落、件件有交代。
    现在，国务院各直属机构中集中整改高潮已经过去的单位，正在进行对整改质量的复查工作，下一步，准备先搞干部下放工作，然后再进入专题深入鸣放和深入整改。
