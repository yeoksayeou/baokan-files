Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 24th: Nine types of solar energy appliances were exhibited on the plaza of the Shanghai Science and Technology Popularization Association on the 22nd.

These nine solar energy appliances were designed by Chen Dayu, a technician from the Sixth Design Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building, and manufactured by the joint state-private Shunxin Electromechanical Factory. Their characteristics are good effect and low cost. For example, an air preheating dryer costs only a little over one hundred yuan, but its effect is four times higher than natural drying under sunlight, and it is more hygienic, making it most suitable for drying candies, raisins, etc. Another example is a solar-powered hot water shower system, which costs only a little over one thousand yuan.

According to Chen Dayu, the designer of these appliances, China is located in the North Temperate Zone and has good conditions for utilizing solar energy. Although it is December now, solar energy can still be used to cook rice and boil water in Shanghai.

    利用太阳能的器械
    据新华社上海24日电　上海市科学技术普及协会的广场上22日展出了九种利用太阳能的器械。
    这九种太阳能器械是由第一机械工业部设计六分局技术员陈达育负责设计，公私合营顺新机电厂加工制造的。它们的特点是效果好、成本省。如一只空气预热式干燥器，成本只要一百多元，效果比阳光下自然干燥要高四倍，并且比较卫生，最适宜于干燥糖果、葡萄干等用。又如一套利用太阳能的热水淋浴设备，只要一千多元费用。
    据设计这几种器械的陈达育介绍，我国地处北温带，有利用太阳能的良好条件。现在虽是12月天气，但在上海还能利用太阳能来煮饭、烧水。
