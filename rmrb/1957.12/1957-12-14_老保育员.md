　　The Old Nursery Worker
　　Dong Yao
　　When I came to Zhao Village this time, the commune had just finished the socialist debate. Commune leader Zhao Damao waved at me from afar as soon as he saw me. We shook hands, exchanged greetings, and I asked him, "Damao, what are you holding in your hand?"
　　Damao said proudly, "Socialism!"
　　"What?"
　　"Is that still fake?" As he said that, he opened his hand: "Look, the central government just announced the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program. This is our three-year plan based on the draft."
　　As he said that, he grabbed my luggage and ran to his house.
　　Damao's mother, Zhao San'da niang, was walking out of the north room and bumped into me. When Zhao San'da niang saw it was me, she said with a mix of laughter, "Oh my, what wind blew you here today? I've been thinking about you in my dreams for the past two years, hoping you would come like waiting for a gold mine; writing letters wouldn't reach you; I've always been concerned about you. This time..."
　　It seemed that Zhao San'da niang had a lot to say. Damao quickly said, "Mother, go boil some water. Old Dong traveled a long way and must be thirsty."
　　San'da niang busily said, "Okay, okay, let's talk later, mother and son."
　　After San'da niang left, I stared at her back for a while. Perhaps Damao saw through my thoughts, and he quickly said, "My mother has changed a lot. Everyone in the village says she has become a different person. When the commune selected three good members, the first person everyone nominated was her..."
　　This matter brought my thoughts back to 1950; although this place had been liberated for almost two years, life was still difficult. Originally, I came to this township to work on production and disaster relief; later, the leaders decided to have me stay here to work. Zhao Village is located on the old course of the Yellow River, all sandy soil, and the soil is very barren. In the past, the grain harvested each year was only enough to eat for four or five months, and people's lives were half grain and half chaff. Zhao San'da niang, since marrying into Zhao Village, had been a famous hard worker. For more than forty years, she had been living a hard life of food and fuel shortages. Even in her sixties, she was still going up the mountains and down to the lakes all day long, picking up firewood and grass. The hard life made San'da niang's temper very irritable. No matter how big or small the matter, she had to quarrel with the neighbors. I remember that around the Mid-Autumn Festival that year, it rained for more than ten days. Not only the masses, but even the township government was short of firewood. Cook Lao Zhu, with Damao's permission, took a handful of kindling from his woodpile. Who knew that Zhao San'da niang saw it. She jumped out:
　　"Lao Zhu, you black-hearted fellow, you see even this little bit of stuff of mine! I have been bullied all my life, and now you are taking advantage of your official position to bully me again. Is there any way for me to live? Just kill me, don't oppress me like this in the open and behind my back..."
　　She scolded and cursed, no matter how we apologized and explained, she still cursed incessantly. In the end, we had to avoid her. Who knew that she cursed for three days and three nights.
　　Later, the people of the village said to me, "Why did you poke the tiger's tail? She is the famous 'King Yama's Grandma' in our village. If you offend her, even the ancestors buried in the ground won't rest in peace. You don't know, even the children in the village are afraid of her." After that, we never dared to provoke her again. But I have never forgotten San'da niang's temper, even when I bumped into her when I first entered the door, I fully expected to be scolded. I didn't expect Da Niang to have changed.
　　That night, at my request, the commune's deputy director, Wang Lanying, told me the following story:
　　Not long after the cooperative was established, the commune decided to set up a busy season childcare group in order to give full play to the labor enthusiasm of women. Who should be the nursery worker? Zhao San'da niang volunteered, but when people heard that Zhao San'da niang wanted to be the nursery worker, they all said, "I'd rather have my child cry at home than have King Yama's Grandma look after them."
　　This did not discourage Zhao San'da niang's determination to be a nursery worker. She actively strived to look after a few children first. So she used the money she had saved up in the years since liberation to buy toys and snacks for the children. Coupled with her patience, the children were willing to be with her. Later, she bought powder and rouge for the children, washed their faces, and put makeup on them. The adults who hadn't sent their children there, when they saw Zhao San'da niang's diligence and how well the children were taken care of, were also relieved to send them. Once, Zhu Baoliu's fourth child, Xiao Zhu, suddenly fell ill, and everyone had gone to work. Zhao San'da niang arranged the other children and braved the heat to go to Zhangji Town, more than ten miles away, to take Xiao Zhu to see a doctor. On the way back, Zhao San'da niang was so hot that she could hardly breathe. When she was about to get home, she suddenly collapsed. When Zhao San'da niang woke up, Baoliu's wife quickly said, "San'da niang, you have worked so hard! Our child eats the sweets you bought every day; this time the child is sick, and you, old lady, have been implicated and fell ill with heatstroke. I really don't know how to repay you!..." Zhao San'da niang wiped her eyes, took a few breaths, and said a little impatiently, "Sister-in-law Liu, don't talk like that. Aren't we in the same commune? A commune is a family. If you don't care for your own child, who will? Don't say such things again."
　　The commune was very busy. The next day, a meeting was held to study the plan to catch up with the rich middle peasants. Deputy Director Wang Lanying was holding her newborn child, Jianshe, but couldn't coax him. The little guy kept crying, and Lanying angrily shouted, "Go! Go! Go! Hurry up and go to Grandma Zhao San."
　　When Grandma Zhao San took the child in her arms and patted him a few times, the child really stopped crying.
　　Seeing Zhao San'da niang, and then looking at the three-year plan, I thought to myself: If people like Zhao San'da niang have changed so well, is there anything more difficult to transform than people's thinking?

    我这一次到赵庄来的时候，社里刚刚结束社会主义大辩论，社长赵大毛一看到我老远的就招手，我们握了握手，叙了叙别情，我问他：“大毛，手里拿的啥？”
    大毛满神气的说：“社会主义呀！”
    “什么？”
    “这还假了吗？”说着他把手摊开：“呶，中央才公布的农业发展纲要修正草案，这是咱根据草案作的三年规划。”
    说着，就拿着我的行李，一股劲就跑到他家。
    大毛娘赵三大娘正从北屋往外走，没注意一下子走了个顶怀。赵三大娘一看是我，连说加笑的说：“哎呀呀，今儿是哪风把你吹来了呀，这两年大娘做梦还想着你，像盼金山似的也盼不来；写信吧又不知你在哪儿；想你的这份心，一直也放不下。这一次……”
    看起来赵三大娘有很多话要说，大毛忙说：“娘，你烧水去吧，老董老远路子赶来，怕渴了。”
    三大娘又忙着说：“好，好，咱娘儿俩回头再说话。”
    三大娘走后，我看着她的背影怔了一会。也许大毛看透了我的心事，他忙着说：“我娘变多了，村里人都说她成了另外一个人了。上天社里评选三好社员，大伙提名的第一个人就是她……”
    事情就这样把我的思想拉回到1950年上去了；那时虽然这里解放快两年了，苦生活还没大变。原先我到这乡搞生产救灾；后来领导上决定我留在这里工作。赵庄这个地方，处在废黄河故道上，全是沙土地，地质十分瘠薄，过去每年总是收的粮食只够四、五个月吃的，人民生活就是糠菜半年粮。赵三大娘这个人从嫁到赵庄起，就是有名的劳动能手，四十多年一直过着缺吃无烧的苦日子，到了六十多岁还是终天上山下湖，拾柴拾草的。苦日子把三大娘的性子练的也十分暴躁，不管大小事，他非要和邻居骂仗不可。记得那年中秋前后，小雨一下就是十多天。别说群众，连乡政府也缺柴，炊事员老朱征得大毛同意，在他家柴垛上抽了一把引火柴。谁知正被赵三大娘看到。她一跳跑了出来：
    “老朱，你这个黑心眼子的，我老妈子就这点东西你也看到眼里，我受民讹受了一辈子，你又依着官势来欺我，这还有我活的吗；你就杀了我吧，别这样明欺暗压的……”
    她连说带骂，不管我们怎样赔礼和解释，她仍是骂不绝口，最后我们只好躲开，谁知她一连就骂了三天三宿。
    后来这村群众对我说：“您怎么就戳老虎尾巴呀，她是咱村有名的‘阎王奶奶’，惹了她连入了土的老祖宗也不得安。你不知道，连庄上小孩没有不怕她的。”以后我们就再也不敢惹她了。可是三大娘这份脾气，我一直没有忘，就是刚进门碰了个顶怀的时候，我满以为又要挨一顿苦骂。没想到大娘变了。
    这天晚上，社里的副主任王兰英应我的要求，给我讲了这样一段故事：
    合作社成立不久，社里为了发挥妇女劳力的劳动积极性，决定成立农忙托儿组，叫谁当保育员呢？赵三大娘就自告奋勇，可是人家一听赵三大娘要当保育员，都说：“把孩子放家里哭也不让阎王奶奶看。”
    这并没有打消赵三大娘当保育员的决心，她积极争取先少看几个，于是她就把解放几年积存的钱，自动给孩子们买点玩的呀，吃的呀，加上她的耐心，孩子都愿意跟她了。后来她又买点粉呀，红呀，给孩子洗洗抹抹呀，没有送来孩子的大人，一看到赵三大娘这个殷勤，孩子又整理的这样好，也都放心送来了。有一次，朱宝六的四孩子小珠忽然得了病，大家又都去干活去了，赵三大娘把其余的孩子安排一下，冒着炎热跑到十多里以外的张集镇上给小珠去看病。在回来的路上，赵三大娘几次热的喘不过气来，快回到家的时候，她忽然倒下了。等赵三大娘醒来的时候，宝六妻子忙说：“三大娘呀，你可费心了，咱那孩子整天吃你买的糖呀的；这次孩子病了，看把你老人家也连累加热病倒了，俺真不知怎么报答你了！……。”赵三大娘擦了擦眼，喘了几口气，有点不耐烦的说：“六嫂子，说话别这么你的我的，咱不是一社吗，一个社就是一家人，自家的孩子自己不问，你说叫谁问呀；以后可不许这么说的。”
    社里很忙，第二天又开会研究实现赶上富裕中农的规划，副主任王兰英抱着她的头生子建设，怎么也哄不好，小家伙直哭，兰英气的吵着：“去！去！去！赶快跟赵三奶奶。”
    等赵三奶奶把孩子抱在怀里，拍了几拍，孩子当真的一声也不哭了。
    看到赵三大娘，我又看了三年规划，心里在想：像赵三大娘这样的人都变的这样好了，还有什么比人的思想再难改造的吗？
