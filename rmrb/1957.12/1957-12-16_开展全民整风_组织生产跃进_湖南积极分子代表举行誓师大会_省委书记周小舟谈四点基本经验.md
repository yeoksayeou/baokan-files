Xinhua News Agency, Changsha Electric Dispatch: The Hunan Provincial Socialist Agricultural Construction Activist Representatives Conference concluded in Changsha on the 11th. The conference lasted six days, with 1,041 representatives attending. This conference was a mobilization rally for the great leap forward in agricultural production in Hunan Province.

Cheng Qian, Governor of Hunan Province, Zhou Xiaozhou, First Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Hu Jizong, Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, all delivered reports at the conference. During the conference, the representatives studied and discussed the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) and exchanged production experiences. Representatives from the 56 participating communes also presented eight proposals to all representatives, and through them, to all farmers in the province: "On Achieving High Yield Grain Production," "On Vigorously Constructing Water Conservancy Projects to Eliminate Drought Early," "On Vigorously Promoting Manure Collection to Increase Agricultural Production," "On Vigorously Developing Pig Production," "Using the Spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Moved Mountains to Comprehensively Develop the Mountain Economy," "On Vigorously Developing Lake Area Production," "On Continuing to Actively Take Measures to Transform Low-Yield Fields into High-Yield Fields," and "On Increasing the Public Accumulation of Communes and Expanding Reproduction." The proposals asserted that the lake areas, mountain areas, and hilly areas of the province have created advanced experiences in increasing production in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries. As long as we clarify the direction of socialism in rural areas and continue to adopt measures to increase production, such as constructing water conservancy projects, increasing fertilizer accumulation, and improving soil, it is possible to organize a great leap forward in agricultural production.

At the conference, the Hunan Provincial People's Committee, on behalf of the Ministry of Agriculture, held an award ceremony for advanced communes in Hunan Province that won the title of National Agricultural Labor Model in 1956, awarding them Patriotic Bumper Harvest Medals, Patriotic Bumper Harvest Certificates, and bonuses. The awarded agricultural cooperatives were: Liuyang Xingxing Cooperative, Linli Fuqiang Cooperative, Wangcheng Xitang Cooperative, Changsha Hongqi Cooperative, Liling Hejiaqiao Cooperative, and Xinlian Cooperative.

Zhou Xiaozhou, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, made a report on "Deeply Launching the Mass Rectification Movement and Organizing the Great Leap Forward in Agricultural Production Next Year." According to the Hunan Provincial Agricultural Development Plan, by 1967, the total grain output of the province will reach 45.4 billion jin, with an average of 890 jin per mu, and 35 million pigs will be raised. The average net income per person will be 150 to 160 yuan.

Comrade Zhou Xiaozhou said that to accelerate the development of agricultural production and achieve a great leap forward in agricultural production, there are the following four basic experiences:

First, listen to the Communist Party, resolutely take the socialist road, and constantly struggle against capitalist ideology. The struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads inside and outside the cooperatives is still an acute and complex struggle, which is manifested in all aspects of production plans, business management, and product distribution. In order to implement this struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads, it is necessary to carry out the rectification movement in the countryside, to carry out great airing of views, great contending, and great debates, and rectification and reform in the countryside. We must adopt the method of mass discussion and criticism, and at the same time take specific measures to impose necessary restrictions on capitalism and spontaneous tendencies. It is necessary to stipulate the necessary discipline of collective life, so that the will of all farmers to build socialism can be concentrated and persevered.

Second, boldly reform technology and overcome right-leaning conservative thinking. An important experience of the Xingxing Agricultural Cooperative in Liuyang County in achieving bumper harvests year after year is to vigorously promote a series of advanced production technologies with a spirit of bold innovation, such as changing intercropping to continuous cropping, sparse planting to dense planting, salt water seed selection, suitable seedling fields, cultivating strong seedlings, advancing the season, intensive cultivation and meticulous farming, promoting improved varieties, improving soil, and rational fertilization and irrigation. They adopted a positive and prudent approach, the entire cooperative held technical night schools, established technical research organizations, and each area established technical groups. The main cadres of the ten cooperatives personally grasped experimental fields and conducted various production experiments, achieving great results. It is recommended that each agricultural cooperative set aside about 1% of the fields as experimental areas to do a good job in scientific experiments on various new technologies.

Third, work diligently and actively in production and expand the collective economy. The Daxing Cooperative in Pingjiang County is located on Phoenix Mountain at an altitude of 1,500 meters above sea level, where natural conditions are very poor. Thanks to the active labor of the members and the transformation of natural conditions, the average grain yield of the entire cooperative this year was 737 jin per mu. The heroic spirit of the members of the Daxing Cooperative is worth learning. At present, some cadres and masses of agricultural cooperatives are always thinking about the value of work points in the agricultural cooperatives that year. Some people are afraid of "working to death" and are unwilling to engage in more basic construction, and are unwilling to engage in agricultural and sideline production with low labor work point values. They only look at their present, not their future, and do not think about future generations. If they look further and think further, they will know that although they have done more labor days, the value of work points may be lower this year, but the labor is by no means in vain, and it will increase next year, the year after, and in three to five years. We must have a broader and longer-term vision, and we must especially emphasize the development of mountain production.

Fourth, practice strict economy, reduce costs, and increase accumulation to continuously expand reproduction. Finally, Comrade Zhou Xiaozhou gave detailed instructions on the rural rectification, consolidation, and production work this winter.

　　开展全民整风　组织生产跃进
    湖南积极分子代表举行誓师大会
    省委书记周小舟谈四点基本经验
    据新华社长沙电　湖南省社会主义农业建设积极分子代表会议11日在长沙闭幕。会议共开了六天，出席代表一千零四十一人。这次会议是湖南省农业生产大跃进的进军誓师大会。
    湖南省省长程潜，中共湖南省委第一书记周小舟，中共湖南省委书记胡继宗都分别在大会上作了报告。会议期间，代表们学习和讨论了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案），同时交换了生产经验。出席会议的五十六个社的代表，也分别向全体代表，并通过他们向全省农民，提出了“关于为实现粮食高额丰产”“关于大力兴修水利，提前消灭旱灾”“关于大力开展积肥运动增加农业生产”“关于大力发展生猪生产”“用愚公移山的劲头，全面发展山区经济”“关于大力发展湖区生产”“关于继续积极采取措施，改低产田为高产田”“关于增加社的公共积累、扩大再生产”等八个倡议书。倡议书认为，本省湖区、山区、丘陵区在农、林、渔、牧、副业等各项生产上，都创造有增产的先进经验。只要我们明确了在农村搞社会主义的方向，继续采取兴修水利、增积肥料、改良土壤等增产措施，就有可能组织农业生产大跃进。
    在这次会议上，湖南省人民委员会代表农业部，给湖南省荣获1956年度全国农业劳动模范称号的先进社，举行了颁发爱国丰产奖章、爱国丰产奖状和奖金的给奖典礼。受奖的农业社是：浏阳星星社、临澧富强社、望城西塘社、长沙市红旗社、醴陵贺家桥社、新联社。
    省委第一书记周小舟作了关于“深入开展全民整风运动，组织明年农业生产大跃进”的报告。根据湖南省农业发展规划，到1967年全省粮食总产量达到四百五十四亿斤，每亩平均八百九十斤，养猪三千五百万头。每人平均纯收入一百五十到一百六十元。
    周小舟同志说，要加速农业生产的发展，实现农业生产大跃进，有以下四条基本经验：
    一、听共产党的话，坚决走社会主义道路，不断和资本主义思想作斗争。在合作社内外社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，仍然是一场尖锐复杂的斗争，它表现在生产计划、经营管理、产品分配等各个方面。为要贯彻进行这种社会主义对资本主义两条道路的斗争，就必须开展农村的整风运动，要开展农村的大鸣、大放、大争和整改，要采取群众讨论，开展批评的办法，同时也要采取具体措施，对于资本主义和自发倾向加以必要的限制。要规定必要的集体生活的纪律，使全体农民建设社会主义的意志得以集中起来，坚持下去。
    二、大胆改革技术，克服右倾保守思想。浏阳县星星农业社连年获得丰收的一条重要经验是以大胆革新的精神，大力推广了一系列的先进生产技术，如间作改连作，稀植改密植，盐水选种，合式秧田，培育壮秧，提早季节，精耕细作，推广良种，改良土壤，合理施肥，合理排灌等。他们采取积极慎重的方针，全社举办了技术夜校，成立了技术研究组织，各片成立了技术小组，十个社主要干部亲自掌握试验田，进行各种生产试验，取得了很大成绩。建议每个农业社搞1％左右的田土作为试验区，来做好各种新技术的科学试验。
    三、勤劳地积极生产，扩大集体经济。平江县大兴社在拔海一千五百公尺的凤凰山上，自然条件很差，由于社员积极劳动，改造了自然条件，今年全社粮食亩产七百三十七斤。大兴社社员的英雄气概是值得学习的。目前有些农业社的干部和群众总是想着农业社当年工分值的高低，有些人怕“累死人”不愿意多搞基本建设，不愿意多搞劳动工分值低的农业和副业生产，他们只看自己的今天，不看自己的明天，不想子孙万代的事情，假若看得远一点，想得远一点，就会知道虽然多做了劳动日，今年工分值可能低一些，但是劳动决不是白费的，明年后年、三年五年就会增加。我们的眼光要放远些、大些，要特别强调发展山区的生产。
    四、厉行节约，降低成本，增加积累，以不断扩大再生产。最后，周小舟同志就今冬农村整风、整社、生产等工作作了详尽的指示。
