Thoughts on the Harvest
Gong Zhizang

In my hand is a heavy bundle of rice ears. How heavy it is! No, this bundle of rice ears weighs the same as the rice ears from the previous years of bumper harvests, but in my heart, it weighs so much more!

Last year, a category 12 typhoon made landfall…

Clouds were fleeing, painting the sky with terror; willows were bending, lying horizontally on the edges of fields and corners of houses; river water rose sharply, peering into the fields and villages…

The category 12 typhoon swept over the rice fields during the flowering and grain-filling stage, and the rice ears withered; the rice stalks resembled winter thatch. The category 12 typhoon swept through the closed doors of farmers' homes, and at night, by the lamplight, how many people sighed about how to make it through to the coming year.

The newly established agricultural cooperative suffered a heavy blow. Nature's remaining enemies set up a roadblock on the road to collectivization.

The newly established agricultural cooperative faced threats. Class enemies took the opportunity to organize reactionary forces to conspire to suffocate the agricultural cooperative.

The cooperative looked to the cooperative, the village looked to the village, and the masses looked to the Party.

"Find every possible way to strive for a bumper harvest year in 1957." The Party, with its wise eyes, saw through the bottom line of the countryside, used clear language to expose the truth that was being obscured, and used firm gestures to encourage my young and weak heart.

County committee cadres were sent down to settle in the countryside. The Party rectified the agricultural cooperative in the face of difficulties, and found the end of the thread in a tangled mess. The Party discerned everything with keen insight, distinguishing between the thinking of hostile classes and the negative and backward phenomena of the peasants.

Through a red line, those black, filthy garbage: fake cooperative members who were actually rich peasants, merchants masquerading as cooperative members, landlords hiding daggers under their pillows while falsely claiming to be reformed… in the class struggle, in broad daylight, they became rats scurrying across the street.

I saw the countryside experiencing a baptism of spring rain. At the break of dawn, the old grandfather opened the door and said with confidence: "The agricultural cooperative will surely look up this year."

I heard the magnificent sound of the countryside marching towards nature. Big rivers and small lakes dredged with mud boats, teams carrying shoulder poles on the edges of fields and roads. Shouting "Heave-ho," thinking of "Bumper Harvest" in their hearts. What is flowing is drop after drop of sweat, what will be harvested is pearls of rice.

In my hand is a heavy bundle of rice ears. How heavy it is! The Party's great achievements, the peasants' down-to-earth hard work, my heart changing from weak to strong… How could all of this not make it weigh heavily in my heart!

    丰收情思
    龚治臧
    手里是一束沉甸甸的稻穗，它的分量多重呵！不，这束稻穗，和以往的几个丰收年头的稻穗分量一样重，但在我心中分量可重呵！
    去年，十二级强台风登陆……
    云在逃难，渲染了满天恐怖；柳树折腰，横倒在场边屋角；河水陡涨，向田头村边窥探……
    十二级强台风掠过扬花孕穗的稻田，稻穗枯萎了，稻禾像冬天的茅草；十二级强台风扫过闭门关户的农家，夜晚灯火前，多少人唉叹怎能挨过来年。
    新建的农业社遭到了沉重的打击，大自然的残敌在合作化的道路上设下一个关卡。
    新建的农业社面临着威胁，阶级敌人趁机组织反动力量阴谋窒息农业社。
    社望社，乡望乡，群众眼望党。
    “想尽千方百计，力争1957的丰产年。”党用睿智的目光洞察了农村的底细，用明智的语言点破了被蒙住的真理，用坚定的手势激励了我那颗幼弱的心。
    下放了县委干部，在农村安家落户。党在困境中整顿了农业社，在一团乱丝中找出了头。党明察秋毫，分清了敌对阶级的思想和农民消极落后的现象。
    透过一条红线，那些黑色的污秽垃圾：假社员真富农，社员的招牌奸商的底子，枕头藏匕首伪称改造好的地主……在阶级斗争中，在光天化日下，变成了过街的老鼠。
    我看到，农村经历了一场春雨的洗涤。天蒙蒙亮，老爷爷推开门，满有信心的说：“农业社今年准会抬头。”
    我听到，农村响起了向大自然进军的雄伟音响。大河小湖?泥船，田头路边担成队。口里喊的“杭育”，心头响的“丰收”。流的是一滴滴汗珠，收获的会是稻米的珍珠。
    手里是一束沉甸甸的稻穗，它的分量多重呵！党的丰功伟绩，农民的踏实苦干，我的心灵由幼弱变得坚强……这许许多多，怎么会不使我心中分量重！
