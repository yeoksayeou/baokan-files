　　Market Stroll
    Shanghai's Free Market
    The tendency towards capitalism that once emerged in Shanghai's free market has been preliminarily corrected. Now, the amount of state-procured and unified-purchase materials flowing into the free market has significantly decreased, and vendors peddling peanuts on the streets have almost disappeared. The prices of 38 types of Chinese medicinal materials, such as fritillary bulbs and rehmannia root, which were once inflated three or four times in black market transactions, have now basically stabilized. Vegetable vendors who withdrew from cooperative groups in the previous period have returned to the cooperative groups with self-criticisms.
    In the past two or three months, Shanghai's industrial and commercial administrative departments have formulated management measures for state-procured and unified-purchase materials, established checkpoints at major traffic arteries to strictly prohibit these materials from flowing into the free market, and strengthened education for vendors to engage in legitimate business, be patriotic and law-abiding, and accept socialist transformation. As a result, transactions in the free market have become more normalized.
    Serving Science
    It is now more convenient to purchase scientific instruments and chemical reagents in the Shanghai market than in the past. The city's state-owned commercial departments have strengthened the operation of these commodities. The Transportation Electrical Equipment Company has designated two stores to be responsible for supplying electrical instruments and electrical equipment needed by scientific and technological departments; the No. 4 store of the Chemical Raw Materials Company has set up special counters for the supply of related commodities. The chemical reagents operated by the Chemical Reagent Store have increased from more than 1,600 kinds in the early third quarter to more than 2,200 kinds. In order to meet the needs, many stores have expanded the operation of small-packaged scientific and technological products, and have also adopted methods such as establishing a goods registration system and implementing door-to-door delivery.
　  Chongqing Expands Variety of Commodities
    Stores in Chongqing that sell daily-use industrial products have added many new varieties.
    In the past, the wholesale and retail businesses of Chongqing's state-owned commercial departments were often disconnected, and many commodities were stockpiled in warehouses and could not be seen by consumers. For example, the raincoat purchased by the purchasing station of the Municipal Department Store originally had more than 100 varieties, but only more than 20 varieties were sold on the market. In order to reverse this phenomenon, the wholesale department recently convened a meeting of representatives of grassroots store salespersons and exhibited more than 9,000 varieties of commodities, such as cultural supplies, department stores, and medicines, for the salespersons to choose from. For example, the commodities needed by the grassroots stores of the Cultural Supplies Company in the fourth quarter had already been purchased, but after this meeting, they purchased an additional 168,000 yuan worth of small new varieties.
　　Nanjing Sees Sharp Increase in Sales of Agricultural Books
    In order to cooperate with the vast number of intellectuals in learning agricultural knowledge, the Nanjing Zhongshan East Road branch of Xinhua Bookstore has set up a special counter for agricultural knowledge books since November. The service staff displayed all the agricultural knowledge books. It is crowded with customers every day, including government cadres who have been approved to go to the countryside as farmers, cadres who are actively striving to become farmers, and many middle and primary school students. According to the statistics of this branch in the past ten days, the sales volume of agricultural knowledge books has increased by nearly 60 times compared with usual. The best-selling books are the "Revised Draft of the National Agricultural Development Program" and various crop high-yield experiences, as well as pig-raising methods, rabbit-raising methods, etc. ·Xinhua News Agency·
     Zhangzhou Daffodils Shipped to Beijing
    When winter flowers wither one after another, if you raise a lush clump of daffodils in a sunny place indoors, the bright pink and white or pink and yellow flowers set off by the verdant green leaves, exuding bursts of fragrance, will bring people's mood to the warm spring scenery.
    In order to meet the diverse needs of the masses in the capital, the Native Produce Management Office of the Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative assigned special personnel to sign a purchase and sales contract for 10,000 daffodil bulbs with relevant operating units in Zhangzhou City, Fujian Province, the origin of daffodils, as early as the beginning of September. The local flower farmers, knowing that the daffodils were to be shipped to the capital, specially selected large and fresh ones, properly packaged them, and delivered the goods in advance, so that they and the daffodil enthusiasts in the capital could meet earlier. At present, this batch of daffodils is being sold uniformly by the Beijing Flower and Tree Company and has begun to supply the market. ·Pu Tiande·

　　市场巡礼
    上海的自由市场
    上海自由市场一度出现的资本主义自发倾向已经初步纠正。现在流入自由市场的国家统购和统一收购物资显著减少，在街头兜售花生的小贩几近绝迹；在黑市交易中价格一度被抬高三、四倍的贝母、生地等三十八种中药材，现在价格已基本稳定。前一时期退出合作小组的蔬菜摊贩，又带着检讨书回到合作小组来了。
    近两、三个月来，上海市工商行政部门制订了统购和统一收购物资的管理办法，在交通要道设立检查站，严禁这些物资流入自由市场，同时加强对小贩进行从事正当经营、爱国守法和接受社会主义改造的教育，因而自由市场的交易更趋正常。
    为科学服务
    现在上海市场上购买科学仪器和化学试剂比过去方便了。该市国营商业部门加强了对这些商品的经营。交通电工器材公司指定了两个商店负责供应科学技术部门所需用的电器仪表和电料设备；化工原料公司第四商店设立了有关商品的供应专柜。化学试剂商店经营的化学试剂由第三季度初的一千六百多种增加到二千二百多种。许多商店为了适应需要，扩大经营小包装的科学技术用品，并且通过建立要货登记制度，实行送货上门等办法。
　  重庆扩大商品花色品种
    重庆市经营日用工业品的商店增加了许多新的花色品种。
    过去，重庆市国营商业部门的批发与零售业务常常脱节，许多商品积压在仓库里，不能与消费者见面。如市百货公司采购站的雨衣，本来有一百多种花色品种，但市场销售的只有二十多种。为了扭转这个现象，前不久批发部门召开了基层商店营业员代表会议，同时展出文化用品、百货、医药等九千多个花色品种的商品，让营业员们选购。如文化用品公司的基层商店第四季度所需要的商品本来早就买好了，但经过这次会议，又选购了十六万八千多元的小宗的新品种。
　　南京农业书籍销量激增
    新华书店南京中山东路门市部为了配合广大知识分子学习农业知识，从11月份起设立了农业知识书籍专台。服务员将所有农业知识书籍全部陈列出来。这里每天都围满了顾客，其中有已经被批准下乡当农民的机关干部，也有正在积极争取当农民的干部，还有很多的中小学生。据这个门市部十天来的统计，农业知识书籍的销售量比平时增加了近六十倍，销量最大的是“全国农业发展纲要修正草案”和各种作物丰产经验，以及养猪法、养兔法等。·新华社·
     漳州水仙运京
    当隆冬花卉纷纷雕零的时节，如果在室内向阳的地方养上一株丛茂的水仙花，那鲜艳粉白或粉黄的花朵衬托着绿油油的青叶，散发出阵阵的芳香，会将人们的心情带到温暖的春景里。
    北京市供销社土产经营处，为了满足首都群众多方面的需要，早在9月上旬，即指派专人向水仙花产地福建漳州市有关经营单位，签订了一万头水仙花的购销合同。产地花农知道水仙花要运往首都，特意挑选了粒大又新鲜的，妥善加以包装，提前交了货，使她和首都的水仙花爱好者早日见面。目前这批水仙已由北京市花木公司统一销售，现已开始供应市场。　·普天德·
