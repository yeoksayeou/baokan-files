Localities are putting great effort into preventing and controlling swine fever.
Preventive injections against swine fever have been carried out in most areas.
This newspaper reports that the winter prevention and control of swine diseases has begun in various places. Sichuan, Shaanxi, Liaoning, Henan and other provinces have successively convened professional meetings. Guangxi, Zhejiang, Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Fujian and other provinces (regions) have all made comprehensive plans and issued instructions (notices) requiring vigorous efforts to carry out preventive injections for pigs. Jiangxi Province discussed and deployed this work at a meeting of rural work department heads of the local party committees. Zhejiang Province convened disease prevention meetings for key areas on a special district basis and established command organizations for the prevention and control of pig diseases at the special district and county levels. On October 30, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee issued a joint directive on quickly stopping the large-scale outflow of live pigs and launching a campaign to prevent swine fever.

After the promulgation of the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program, the enthusiasm of the masses for preventing and controlling swine fever was further encouraged. The work of preventing and controlling swine fever in the second half of this year has taken a leap forward compared with last year and the first half of this year. Sichuan Province proposed in its plan to eliminate swine fever within four years starting from 1958 and to control the epidemic of swine erysipelas and swine pleuropneumonia within five years. Shandong Province plans to eliminate swine fever throughout the province by 1962. The eight key pig-producing counties in Hunan Province are preparing to eliminate swine fever within three years. All provinces unanimously emphasized the need to do a good job in preventive injections before swine fever becomes epidemic, with the injection rate reaching more than 70% of the total number of pigs. Thanks to the attention of leaders at all levels and the active and proactive efforts of the business departments, preventive injections this autumn and winter started earlier and with greater enthusiasm than last year. For example, in Heilongjiang Province, the regular preventive injections against swine fever were basically completed by mid-October, with a total of about one million pigs injected. In Wu Chang County of this province, more than 40,000 pigs were injected in nine days, shortening the time for epidemic prevention work by half a month compared with last year and over fulfilling the planned task. In Liaoning Province, rabbit-adapted attenuated vaccine of swine fever was universally applied in counties and cities for injection starting from September, with a total of more than 2 million pigs injected by August. In Kaiyuan County of this province, only one pig died out of the 30,000 pigs injected, so the masses generally welcomed it, basically achieving "everyone volunteers, every pig gets injected".

In many areas, the agricultural and service departments closely cooperated and acted in unison. Shandong, Jiangxi and other provinces organized working groups from the two departments to go deep into the grassroots to promote preventive injection work. Service departments in Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, Gansu, Guangxi, Fujian, Hebei and other provinces also allocated epidemic prevention funds to support the agricultural departments in carrying out epidemic prevention work.

Liaoning, Guangxi and other provinces, as well as many regions such as Beijing, are actively organizing training courses on the production and injection of rabbit-adapted attenuated vaccine of swine fever. Hunan Province has completed the second phase of training, and Sichuan, Jiangxi and other provinces have trained a number of vaccine production cadres.

　　各地防治猪疫劲头很大
    大部地区开展了猪瘟预防注射
    本报讯　各地的冬季防治猪病工作已开展起来。四川、陕西、辽宁、河南等省，先后召开了专业会议；广西、浙江、黑龙江、内蒙古、甘肃、江西、江苏、福建等省（区）都进行了全面规划，发出了指示（通知），要求大力开展生猪预防注射工作。江西省在地委农村工作部长会议上作了讨论和布置；浙江省以专区为单位，召开了重点地区防疫会议，并建立专区和县的防治猪病指挥机构；中共陕西省委和省人民委员会于10月30日发出了关于迅速制止生猪大量外流和开展预防猪疫运动的联合指示。
    全国农业发展纲要修正草案公布以后，更鼓舞了群众的防治猪瘟的热情，今年下半年的防治猪瘟工作比去年和今年上半年跃进了一步。四川省在规划中提出从1958年起四年内消灭猪瘟，五年内控制猪丹毒和猪肺疫的流行。山东省计划全省在1962年前消灭猪瘟。湖南省的八个生猪生产基点县准备在三年内消灭猪瘟。各省一致强调要求在猪瘟流行以前做好预防注射工作；注射率达到猪总数的70％以上。由于各级领导重视，业务部门积极主动努力，今年秋冬预防注射比去年动手早、劲头也大，如黑龙江省，到10月中旬猪瘟定期预防注射基本结束，共注射生猪约一百万头。这个省的五常县在九天内注射四万多头，比去年缩短防疫工作时间半个月，并且超额完成计划任务。辽宁省从9月开始各县市普遍应用猪瘟兔化弱毒疫苗注射，到8月共注射生猪二百多万头。这个省的开原县注射的三万头猪当中，仅死亡了一头，因此群众普遍欢迎，基本上做到“家家自愿，头头注射”。
    许多地区农业厅和服务厅密切合作一致行动。山东、江西等省由二个厅组织工作组深入基层推动预防注射工作；黑龙江、江苏、甘肃、广西、福建、河北等省的服务部门，还拨出防疫经费支持农业部门开展防疫工作。
    辽宁、广西等省和北京市等许多地区都在积极组织制造和注射猪瘟兔化弱毒疫苗的训练班。湖南省已结束第二期训练，四川、江西等省已训练了一批制苗干部。
