It Depends on Human Effort

　　Countless advanced examples of agricultural production increases are before us, posing a sharp question to every county, every district, and every agricultural cooperative: "If others can do it, why can't we?"
　　December 14th, Zhejiang Daily editorial abstract
    In the past four years, most counties in Zhejiang Province have increased grain production, some have maintained it, and a few have decreased it. Among the counties that have increased production, some have increased it quickly, and some have increased it slowly. What do these imbalances indicate? They indicate that even under the current conditions of relatively backward tools and equipment, agricultural production has enormous potential. The potential lies in the significant differences in yields and the varying rates of increase. Currently, not only have many cooperatives and townships reached a per-mu yield of 800 jin (some have even exceeded 1,000 jin), but some counties have already reached 800 jin throughout the county (or suburban district). According to statistical data, their initial per-mu grain yield at the time of liberation and the base figures for similar areas were comparable. They have achieved 800 jin, which shows that other areas also have the potential to reach the 800 jin target.

    What are the reasons for these significant differences in yields and the varying rates of increase? Some may say that the quality of natural conditions and the degree of disaster are factors. We say that these are correct. However, we must ask: why do we still see significant differences in yields and varying rates of increase in areas with similar or even identical objective conditions?

    Nothing is more persuasive than facts. We can look at the following three comparative figures:

    First, in terms of land utilization. Comparing Huangyan and Pingyang, which are both located in plains areas, Huangyan County planted double-cropping rice on 82.5% of its paddy fields in 1956, with no idle land in autumn and winter. Furthermore, 10% of the fields were planted with green manure and naked barley in the winter, resulting in three crops a year, with a total yield of over 900 jin. Pingyang County, located in the subtropical zone of southern Zhejiang, has a frost-free period of up to 275 days, and other production conditions are better than those of Huangyan and Wenling. However, the winter planting area is less than 50%, with 520,000 mu of idle land in winter, and many places still use old methods such as dry plowing, sun-drying, and burning mud clods. In 1956, the grain yield was only a little over 500 jin per mu, and the increase from 1952 was only about 6%.

    Second, in terms of increasing fertilizer. Lin'an County, located in a hilly area, had only 28,000 mu of green manure at the beginning of liberation. By 1956, it had reached 75,000 mu, accounting for 60% of the paddy field area. In 1951, there were 17,000 pigs, and in 1956, this number increased to 47,000, with an average of one pig for every 3.4 mu of land. Due to sufficient fertilizer, the grain yield in 1956 reached 573 jin per mu, an increase of 49.5% in the past four years. It changed from being short of grain for three months each year before liberation to now having a surplus of grain for six months. Pingyang County, located in a plains area, currently has green manure accounting for only 13% of the paddy field area, with an average of one pig for every 8.6 mu of land. This is also one of the important reasons why the county's grain production has increased slowly, and the per-mu yield is more than 200 jin lower than that of Huangyan and Wenling.

    Third, in terms of water conservancy construction. Comparing Zhuji and Xianju, Zhuji County carried out large-scale water conservancy construction movements continuously for seven years from 1950 to 1956, averaging more than 2.22 million workdays per year. Each male and female able-bodied laborer in the county worked 15 days per year on average, and in 1956, each laborer worked 36 days. Currently, 94% of the county's paddy fields can withstand droughts of more than 30 days, and the double-cropping rice area has increased from 9,000 mu in 1949 to 260,000 mu. In 1956, the grain yield reached 602 jin per mu, an increase of 67% compared to 1949. However, Xianju County has only built 153 water conservancy projects in the past four years, using 130,000 workdays, with each male and female able-bodied laborer working 0.33 days per year, expanding the irrigation area by less than 3,000 mu. The drought-prone area still accounts for 40%. Therefore, the grain yield in 1956 was only 328 jin per mu, a decrease of 14.2% compared to the 1952 yield.

    From the above three comparative figures, the question has been answered very clearly and persuasively. Why do we still see significant differences in yields and varying rates of increase in areas with similar or even identical objective conditions? The decisive issue is still correct leadership, that is, "it depends on human effort."

    Cooperativization has opened up broad prospects for the development of agricultural production and the construction of a new socialist countryside. To make the development of production and the construction of the countryside leap forward under the favorable conditions of cooperativization, that is, to realize the Outline for Agricultural Development, we must rely on human effort. Today, countless advanced examples are before us, posing an extremely sharp question to every county, every district, every township, and every cooperative: "If others can do it, why can't we?" To answer this question, then compare yourselves with those cooperatives, townships, districts, and counties that are at the forefront! Compare the high and low yields, compare the good and bad work. Find the reasons why you are lagging behind from the comparison—is it your leadership's lack of confidence and insufficient enthusiasm? Or is it a lack of understanding and a lack of awareness, underestimating the potential for production? Do you emphasize the particularity of regional conditions and lack sensitivity to advanced things? Or do you rely on the state to solve difficulties and neglect to fully mobilize and rely on the socialist enthusiasm of the masses? Are you satisfied with administrative leadership and not studying production technology? Or have you suffered setbacks in your work and failed to draw the correct lessons from them, but instead shrunk back and dared not even promote advanced experiences suitable for local conditions? In short, through comparison and contrast, specifically analyze the local production situation and work situation, find the subjective and objective reasons why you are not as good as others, and you will find the specific direction for future struggle.

　　事在人为
    无数农业增产的先进榜样摆在我们面前，向我们每个县，每个区，每个农业社提出一个尖锐的问题：“人家能办到，为什么我们办不到？”
　　12月14日浙江日报社论摘要
    四年来，浙江全省粮食生产多数县增产，部分县平产，少数县减产。而增产县当中，又有的增得快，有的增得慢。这些不平衡的情况说明什么问题呢？说明农业生产即使是在目前这种比较落后的工具装备条件下，潜力也是极大的。潜力就在这种产量高低悬殊、增产速度快慢不一之中。现在，全省不仅有许多社和乡已经达到了亩产量八百斤（其中有的已经超过了一千斤），而且有的县已经在全县（市郊区）范围内达到了八百斤。根据统计材料，他们在解放初期粮食亩产量的基数和同类地区的基数是不相上下的，他们达到了八百斤，这就说明其他地区也同样蕴藏着能够达到八百斤指标的潜力。
    是什么原因造成这些产量高低悬殊、增产速度快慢不一呢？对于这个问题，也许有人会说：自然条件好坏是一个原因，受灾程度不同也是一个原因。我们说，这些都是对的。但是，我们要问：为什么在客观条件相似甚至相同的地区，仍然会有产量高低悬殊、增产速度快慢不一的现象呢？
    世上最有说服力的，莫过于事实。我们可以从以下三方面的数字类比来看：
    一，在土地利用方面。以同处平原地区的黄岩和平阳来相互比较，黄岩县，1956年双季稻面积占水田82.5％，秋冬两季没有闲田，并且已有10％的田冬季种植绿肥和裸麦间作，成为一年三熟，全年产量达到九百斤以上。而平阳县处于浙南亚热地带，无霜期长达二百七十五天，其他生产也比黄岩、温岭要好，但是冬种面积还不到50％，尚有冬闲田五十二万亩，许多地方仍然采用燥耕、晒白、烧泥块的老办法。1956年粮食产量每亩只有五百几十斤，1956年比1952年只增长6％左右。
    二，在增加肥料方面。丘陵地区的临安县，解放初期只有绿肥二万八千亩，到1956年，达到七万五千亩，占水田面积60％；1951年有生猪一万七千头，1956年发展到四万七千头，平均三亩四分田有猪一头。由于肥料充足，1956年粮食亩产量达到五百七十三斤，近四年来粮食增产49.5％，由解放前每年缺粮三个月变为现在余粮六个月。而平原地区的平阳县，目前绿肥只占水田面积的13％，平均八亩六分田才有一头猪，这也是这个县粮食增产很慢，亩产量比黄岩、温岭低二百多斤的重要原因之一。
    三，在兴修水利方面。以诸暨和仙居来相互比较，诸暨县1950年至1956年的七年间，连续开展大规模的兴修水利运动，平均每年用工二百二十二万多个，全县每个男女整劳动力每年出工十五个，1956年每个劳力出工达三十六个。目前全县能抗旱三十天以上的水田已达94％，双季稻面积达到71.5％，连作稻从1949年的九千亩发展到二十六万亩，1956年粮食亩产量达到六百零二斤，比1949年增长67％。可是，仙居县四年来只兴修水利一百五十三处，用工十三万个，每一男女整劳动力每年出工零点三三个，扩大灌溉面积不到三千亩，易旱面积仍占40％，因此，1956年粮食亩产量只有三百二十八斤，比1952年产量还减少14.2％。
    从以上三方面的数字对比来看，问题已经得到了十分明确而又十分具有说服力的回答。为什么在客观条件相似甚至相同的地区，仍然会有产量高低悬殊、增产速度快慢不一的现象呢？决定的问题还在于正确的领导，也就是说，“事在人为”。
    合作化为农业生产的发展、为社会主义新农村的建设，开辟了广阔的前途。要使生产的发展、农村的建设在合作化的有利条件下来一个跃进，也就是说要使农业发展纲要得以实现，非依靠人的努力不可。今天有无数先进的榜样摆在我们面前，这就向我们每一个县、每一个区、每一个乡和每一个社，提出了一个极其尖锐的问题：“人家能办到，为什么我们办不到？”要回答这个问题，那么就去和那些走在前头的社、乡、区、县比较一下吧！比比产量高低，比比工作好坏。从比较中寻找自己落在后面的原因——是自己的领导工作信心不足、劲头不够呢？还是不摸底细、心中无数、对生产的潜力估计不足？是强调地区条件的特殊性、对先进事物缺乏敏感呢？还是依赖国家解决困难、忽视了充分发动和依靠群众的社会主义积极性？是满足于行政领导、不钻研生产技术呢？还是工作中受了挫折以后没有从中正确地吸取教训、反而缩手缩脚连适合当地情况的先进经验也不敢推广了？总之，从对照比较中，具体地分析本地的生产情况和工作情况，找出自己不如人家的主客观原因，这就找到了今后具体的奋斗方向。
