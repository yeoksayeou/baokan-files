　　Increasingly Strong Trade Union Organizations

    With the basic victory of China's socialist revolution and the continuous development of socialist construction, the ranks of the working class have grown unprecedentedly, and the organizational construction of trade unions has also been strengthened and changed accordingly. The number of trade union members nationwide has increased from 10.2 million during the Seventh National Congress to more than 16.3 million, an increase of 63.1%; this is more than ten times the number of members during the Sixth National Labor Congress. In industrial areas such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Liaoning, and Jilin, trade union members account for more than 90% of the total number of employees (excluding temporary workers and their members; same below); in industrial systems such as electric power, coal mining, railways, postal and telecommunications, textiles, foreign trade, and printing, trade union members account for more than 90% of the total number of employees; other regions and industrial systems are also around 80%, and more remote areas and scattered industries (such as agriculture and supply and marketing cooperatives) are also around 70%. From this, it can be seen that the vast majority of employees nationwide have joined trade union organizations, especially the employees of industrial systems in the main sectors of the national economy.

    China's trade union is a completely unified organization led by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. At present, under the unified leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, there are seventeen national committees of industrial trade unions, three preparatory committees of industrial trade unions; five working committees, and provincial, municipal, and mining area committees have been gradually established according to industrial distribution and work needs. All provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in the country have established federations of trade unions, and most counties (autonomous counties) and towns have also established trade union organizations.
    The number of grassroots trade union organizations has decreased from 180,000 during the Seventh National Congress to more than 157,000. This is mainly due to the economic reorganization of private small factories, mines, and shops in the socialist transformation, and the merger of factories and shops, which has resulted in changes in the number of grassroots trade union organizations. The number of trade union organizational units has decreased from the original 100,000 to 30,000, while the number of trade union committees with more than 25 people has increased by 20,000 compared with 1953.

　　日益坚强的工会组织
    随着我国社会主义革命的基本胜利和社会主义建设事业的不断发展，工人阶级的队伍空前壮大，工会的组织建设也有了相应的加强和变化。全国工会会员由七次代表大会期间的一千零二十万人，增加到一千六百三十多万人，增长了63.1％；相当于第六次全国劳动大会期间的会员人数的十倍多。北京、上海、天津、辽宁、吉林等工业比较集中的地区，工会会员占职工人数的90％以上（不包括临时工及其会员。下同）；电业、煤矿、铁路、邮电、纺织、外贸、印刷等产业系统的工会会员占职工人数的90％以上；其他地区及产业系统也都在80％左右，比较边远的地区及分散的产业
  （如：农业、供销合作社等）也都在70％左右。由此可以看出：全国绝大部分的职工都已经参加了工会组织，特别是国民经济主要部门的产业系统的职工都已经组织起来了。

    我国工会，是一个以中华全国总工会为领导的完全统一的组织。目前，在中华全国总工会的统一领导下，全国共有十七个产业工会全国委员会，三个产业工会筹备委员会；五个工作委员会，并根据产业分布情况和工作需要，逐步建立了省、市、矿区委员会。全国各省、自治区、市区都建立了工会联合会，绝大部分县（自治县）、镇也都建立了工会组织。
    工会基层组织已经由七次代表大会期间的十八万个，减少到十五万七千多个。这主要是由于社会主义改造中私营的小型厂矿企业及商店的经济改组、实行并厂、并店的结果，工会基层组织的数目也随之发生了变化。工会组织单位由原来十万个，减少到三万个，而二十五人以上的工会委员会却比1953年增加了两万个。
