Xinhua News Agency, December 21st: TASS, London, December 20th: The British government's decision to allow the establishment of US missile bases in the country has aroused indignation among people from all walks of life in Britain.
	"Britain free from the shackles of the United States," "Strive for immediate talks with Russia," these were the slogans raised at a meeting held by London Communist Party members at Holborn Hall. British Communist Party Chairman Gallacher pointed out in his speech that American bombers carrying hydrogen bombs circling over British cities and the establishment of rocket weapons bases in Britain threaten peace. Gallacher emphasized that public dissatisfaction with the government's policies is growing. He called on Labour MPs, trade union movement, and cooperative movement leaders to support the British people's struggle against sacrificing British interests under US aggression plans.
	The movement against the establishment of US bases in Scotland has unfolded on a large scale. As previously reported, the British government intends to set up the first batch of bases in Scotland.
	Meen, a member of the Central Council of the Scottish Trades Union Congress, called on the working people to rise up and fight "against the establishment of missile bases in Scotland or anywhere else in Britain."
	The Mayor of Glasgow, Hood, also opposes the establishment of nuclear weapons in Britain. On the 18th, a large flag was raised on the balcony of the Glasgow City Council, which read: "No rocket weapons bases allowed in Scotland."
Xinhua News Agency, December 21st: The French people are taking various concrete actions to oppose the US plan to establish nuclear weapons and rocket weapons bases on French territory.
	The National Committee of the French Peace Movement called for opposition to turning France into a US missile base. The National Committee of the French Peace Movement issued a statement opposing the storage of atomic weapons and the establishment of rocket launch pads in Europe.
	The statement called on the French people to concern themselves with this issue and resolutely oppose turning France into a missile base.
	Workers in French factories and enterprises have established many "Committees for the Struggle to Defend Security" and have jointly written letters to the governments of NATO countries, French parliamentarians, and prestigious politicians, protesting the establishment of rocket bases in France. Working people from all over the Seine region have elected hundreds of delegations to visit mayors and parliamentarians, protesting against the establishment of rocket weapons on French territory.
Xinhua News Agency, December 21st: Tokyo News: At the US-Japan Security Committee meeting held on the 19th, US Pacific Commander-in-Chief Stump announced that the US government will supply Japan with "Sidewinder" air-to-air missiles. The Japanese government decided to accept the US missiles on the morning of the 20th. Defense Agency officials revealed that Japan will purchase these missiles from the United States and they are expected to arrive in Japan next spring.
	The Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on the US decision to supply Japan with missiles. The statement pointed out that the Japanese government, disregarding its previous promises, has actually agreed to turn Japan and Okinawa into US atomic bases. The statement said that this decision makes Japan more dependent on the US aggressive policies and makes the situation in Asia more tense. The statement called on the Japanese people to rise up more resolutely to defend the cause of peace and national independence.
	The Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement on the 20th, strongly opposing turning Japan into a missile base. The statement pointed out that Japan's acceptance of these missiles marks the first step in the US transporting nuclear weapons into Japan. This action by the Japanese government violates the promise made by Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi that nuclear weapons would never be brought into Japan, and proves that Kishi's promise was completely deceptive. The Socialist Party stated that it would thoroughly investigate this matter in the Diet.
	Aichi University Professor Keishiro Irie stated on the 20th that equipping the Japanese army with air-to-air missiles is part of the US effort to strengthen NATO, SEATO, and the Far East "defense line." This action shows the US conspiracy to regard Japan as a military base in the Far East.
Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 20th: Seoul News: Syngman Rhee's Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, Liu Zaixing, said at a press conference today that the South Korean government has held talks in Seoul with senior US military authorities regarding the issue of transporting US missiles into South Korea. He said that senior US officials had indicated to him that they would equip the South Korean army with missiles.
	Commenting on the decision of the NATO summit to prepare for nuclear missile warfare, Liu Zaixing said that war preparations for the new missile era should also be carried out in the Far East.
	According to senior military personnel of Syngman Rhee, Syngman Rhee's troops are currently receiving training in the use of missiles and nuclear weapons.

    反对接受美国导弹
    美李商量把导弹运进南朝鲜
    据新华社21日讯  塔斯社伦敦20日讯：英国政府允许在国内建立美国导弹基地的决定引起英国各阶层人民的愤慨。
    “英国摆脱美国的箝制”，“争取立即同俄国会谈”，这是伦敦共产党员在荷尔波恩大厅举行的集会上所提出的口号。英国共产党主席加拉赫在会上讲话时指出，带着氢弹在英国城市上空盘旋的美国轰炸机以及在英国建立火箭武器基地，这都威胁着和平。加拉赫强调指出，英国公众对政府政策的不满情绪愈来愈增长了。他呼吁工党的议员、工会运动和合作运动领导人支持英国人民的斗争，反对在美国的侵略计划下牺牲英国的利益。
    反对在苏格兰建立美国基地的运动已经大规模展开。前已报道，英国政府打算首先在苏格兰设置第一批基地。
    苏格兰职工大会中央理事会理事米恩号召劳动人民起来斗争，“反对在苏格兰或者英国其他任何一个地方建立导弹基地”。
    格拉斯哥市市长胡德也反对在英国设置核武器。18日在格拉斯哥市议会阳台上升起一面大旗，上面写着：“不许在苏格兰建立任何火箭武器基地”。
    据新华社21日讯  法国人民正在采取各种具体行动反对美国打算在法国领土上建立核武器和火箭武器基地的计划。
    法和平运动全国委员会号召反对把法国变成美国导弹基地。法国和平运动全国委员会发表声明，反对在欧洲储存原子武器和设置火箭发射台。
    声明号召法国人民过问这个问题，不屈不挠地坚决反对把法国变成导弹基地。
    法国的工厂和企业中的职工们成立了许多“保卫安全斗争委员会”，并且联名写信给北大西洋集团各国政府、法国议员以及有声望的政治家，抗议在法国建立火箭基地。塞纳省各地劳动群众选出了数以百计的代表团去访问市长们和议员们，向他们抗议在法国领土上设置火箭武器。
    据新华社21日讯  东京消息：在19日举行的日美安全委员会会议上，太平洋地区美军总司令斯图普宣布美国政府将把“响尾蛇”式空空导弹供给日本。日本政府在20日上午已经决定接受美国的导弹。防卫厅官员透露，日本将向美国购卖这种导弹，预料明年春天可以运到日本。
    日本共产党就美国决定供给日本导弹一事发表声明。声明指出，日本政府不顾以前的诺言，竟然同意把日本和冲绳岛变成美国的原子基地。声明说，这个决定使日本更加依附美国的侵略政策，使亚洲的局势更加紧张。声明号召日本人民更加坚决地起来捍卫和平事业和国家的独立。
    日本社会党20日发表声明，强烈反对把日本变成导弹基地。声明指出，日本接受这种导弹标志着美国把核武器运进日本的第一步。日本政府的这种行动违背了日本首相岸信介曾经做过的绝不把核武器运进日本的诺言，并且证明岸信介的诺言完全是个欺骗。社会党表示要在国会中彻底追究这件事。
    爱知大学教授入江启四郎20日发表谈话说，用空空导弹装备日本军队是美国为了加强北大西洋公约组织、东南亚条约组织以及远东“防御线”的一环。这一行动表明美国把日本当作远东的军事据点的阴谋。
    据新华社平壤20日电  汉城消息：李承晚的联合参谋总长刘载兴今天在记者招待会上说，南朝鲜政府已经同美国高级军事当局就把美国导弹运入南朝鲜的问题在汉城举行了会谈。他说，美国的高级官员向他表示将用导弹来装备南朝鲜军队。
    刘载兴在评论北大西洋集团首脑会议关于进行核导弹战争准备的决定时说，在远东方面也应当进行新的导弹时代的战争准备。
    据李承晚的高级军事人员透露，李承晚的部队目前正在接受使用导弹和核武器的训练。
