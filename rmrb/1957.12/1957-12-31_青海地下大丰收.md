Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 30th: The Qinghai Petroleum Prospecting Brigade of the Ministry of Geology has achieved fruitful results in the Qaidam and Hoh Xil Basins this year.

    During large-scale petroleum prospecting in the southern and western parts of the Qaidam Basin and its marginal areas, this team has discovered nine structures with potential for oil storage and has also found oil sandstone, providing important conditions for evaluating the oil-bearing prospects of the entire basin. Exploration in the Hoh Xil area on the northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains has resulted in the discovery of five new oil-bearing structures, the largest of which covers approximately 700 square kilometers. The structure is complete, with good closure, and strongly odorous sandstone has also been found. Preliminary surveys show that the Hoh Xil Basin is adjacent to Kumukuli in Xinjiang and can serve as a reserve base for petroleum exploration in China.

    In geological drilling conducted in the Qaidam Basin, oil has flowed twice recently in the Mahai structure. The effective closure area of this structure is 380 square kilometers, and it is a self-flowing well, currently undergoing oil testing. Recently, sandstone (rock layers with sandstone may contain oil) was also discovered during drilling in the Lenghu No. 7 structure. Through surface and underground geological work, another batch of oil-bearing structures suitable for drilling has been submitted to the state this year.

    While conducting petroleum prospecting, this brigade also paid attention to searching for other mineral deposits and has discovered chromium, gold, copper, iron, coal, graphite, and other important mineral locations.

    青海地下大丰收
    据新华社西宁30日电　地质部青海石油普查大队今年在柴达木和霍霍希里盆地获得丰硕的成果。
    这个队在柴达木盆地南部和西部以及边缘地区进行大规模的石油普查中，已发现九个可能储油的构造，并且找到了油砂岩，对评价整个盆地的含油远景提供了重要条件。在昆仑山北坡霍霍希里地区勘探的结果，新发现了五个储油构造，其中最大的约达七百平方公里，构造完整、圈闭较好，并且还发现油味强烈的砂岩。初步勘察了解，霍霍希里盆地同新疆的库木库里相毗邻，可为我国石油勘探后备基地。
    在柴达木盆地进行的地质钻探中，最近马海构造曾两次出油。这个构造的有效圈闭面积为三百八十平方公里，是一自喷井，现在正在进行试油工作。最近在冷湖七号构造钻探中也发现了砂岩（有砂岩的岩层就可能有石油）。通过地面和地下地质工作，今年又有一批可供钻探的储油构造向国家提交。
    这个大队在进行石油普查工作的同时，还注意寻找其他矿藏。并且已经发现有铬、金、铜、铁、煤、石墨和其他重要矿点。
