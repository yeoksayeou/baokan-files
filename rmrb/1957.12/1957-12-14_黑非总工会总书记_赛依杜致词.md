Comrade Chairman, fellow delegates, and comrades attending the meeting:
We, as fraternal guests invited to attend the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, bring you the greetings of the black African workers.

Our presence here is by no means a courtesy visit, but a concrete expression of our General Confederation's determination to strengthen the solidarity between the workers of People's China and the workers of black Africa.

Please allow us, through this congress, to pay tribute to the great Chinese revolution. The great Chinese revolution is one of the most significant events of our century. This people's revolution has opened up new prospects for the whole world, especially for colonial and semi-colonial countries.

The General Confederation of Black African Workers is the vanguard of the anti-colonialist struggle, and it is the true leading force of the African people's liberation struggle.

Its activities have expanded to the entire French-ruled Black Africa: Senegal, Sudan, Guinea, Upper Volta, Ivory Coast, Dahomey, Niger, Mauritius, Togo, Cameroon, and so on.

Its activities influence the entire political, economic, and social life of Africa.

Let us briefly talk about the work, program, and policies of the General Confederation of Black African Workers.

The purpose of the General Confederation is to organize African workers, unite them, and enable all African trade union organizations to fight in a concerted manner against the colonial system and all forms of oppression and exploitation, to safeguard their various economic and social demands, to strive for the legal recognition of the dignity of African workers, and for the overall liberation of the local people.

This means that the activities of the General Confederation of Black African Workers permeate all the struggles of workers in economically backward countries to achieve their own liberation, promote the economic and social progress of the people, and realize true democracy.

In the social sphere, it demands the abolition of all forms of oppression and exploitation, creating conditions for improving the living standards of the working masses and eliminating possible contradictions between the various strata of African society.

In the economic sphere, for the vital interests of the people of all countries, develop the resources of Africa:

1.  Abolish the current mercantile economy and change the current exchange system to make it conform to the interests of the people;
2.  Modernize agriculture and animal husbandry;
3.  Build industries, especially processing industries, to protect the current and future interests of the local people.

In the political sphere, fight to eliminate the colonial system, strive for the liberation of the African people, and defend public and individual freedom.

The General Confederation of Black African Workers has decided to develop friendly, fraternal, and mutually supportive relations with workers of all countries around the world, in accordance with the principle of proletarian internationalism.

Its content can be summarized as follows: Workers and the entire people unite and fight for the common goal of eliminating colonialism. Developing Africa and improving the living conditions of the African people through fair and reasonable distribution of our country's wealth among all social strata means carrying out the economic modernization and planning of African countries that benefits the people of all social strata.

The entire African people support this program, and they are fighting enthusiastically to achieve its goals.

Despite repression and frequent violations of trade union rights, the workers' struggle is intensifying in order to regain their sovereignty.

In Togo, workers staged a strong strike against the merger regulations, forcing the French government to concede. In Dakar, a seventeen-day general strike broke out in August this year, resulting in an increase in the minimum guaranteed wages for all industries. In Guinea, livestock and agricultural workers staged a major strike. In French Sudan, the Niger Company went on strike.

Other actions, no less significant than the above-mentioned strikes, are currently brewing.

Comrades, all these struggles embody the unwavering will of the working masses under the yoke of colonialism. Under the yoke of colonialism, no compromise is possible.

The African people, long enslaved under a system of inhuman exploitation and cultural oppression, can no longer tolerate their humiliating position of servitude. They have since realized that only liberation can improve their living conditions.

We also know that imperialism, as the highest stage of capitalism, is showing weakness and incompetence in the face of the rapid growth of progressive forces worldwide, due to its own insurmountable contradictions, and it is trying to hold on to the last bastion: the African continent.

However, we are full of confidence in the victory of our struggle because we are not alone.

Your congress is a brilliant proof of the ever-consolidating solidarity of workers around the world. It further illustrates the great significance of the historically significant and universally true motto: "Workers of all countries, unite!"

We congratulate you on the complete victory of your congress. Chinese comrades, thank you for your kind invitation.

Long live the solidarity of workers of the world!
Long live the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions!

### 黑非总工会总书记  赛依杜致词

专栏：

    黑非总工会总书记
    赛依杜致词主席同志，各位代表和列席的同志们：
    我们作为应邀参加中国工会第八次全国代表大会的兄弟来宾，给你们带来了黑非工人们的问候。
    我们来到这里，绝不是一个礼节上的访问，而是我们总工会决心加强人民中国工人同黑非工人之间的团结的具体表示。
    请允许我们，通过这个代表大会向伟大的中国革命致敬。伟大的中国革命是我们这个世纪中最重大的事情之一。这个人民革命为全世界，特别是为殖民地和半殖民地国家，开辟了新的前途。
    黑非总工会是反殖民主义斗争的先锋队，它真正是非洲人民进行解放斗争的领导力量。
    它的活动已扩大到仍在法国统治下的整个黑非洲：塞内加尔、苏丹、几内亚、上伏尔达、象牙海岸、达荷美、尼日尔、毛里求斯、多哥、喀麦隆等等。
    它的活动影响到整个非洲的政治、经济和社会生活。
    让我们简略地谈谈黑非总工会的工作、纲领和方针。
    总工会的目的，在于组织非洲工人，使他们团结起来，使所有的非洲工会组织行动一致地展开斗争，反对殖民制度和人压迫人、人剥削人的一切形式，维护它们在经济与社会方面的各种要求，争取非洲工人的人格尊严得到合法承认以及本地各族人民的全面解放。
    这就意味着，所有经济落后国家的工人为争取自身的解放、促使人民的经济和社会方面的进步和真正民主的实现而进行的斗争中，都渗透着黑非总工会的活动。
    在社会方面，要求取消一切压迫和剥削的形式，为提高劳动群众的生活水平和消除非洲社会各阶层之间可能存在的矛盾创造条件。
    在经济方面，为了各国人民的重要利益，开发非洲的资源：
    1．取缔现行的贩买生意式的经济，改变目前的汇兑制度，使它符合人民的利益；
    2．使农业和牧畜业经济现代化；
    3．建设工业，特别是加工工业，来保卫当地人民的目前和未来的利益。
    在政治方面，为消灭殖民主义制度、争取非洲人民的解放和保卫公众与个人自由而进行斗争。
    黑非总工会决定遵照无产阶级国际主义的原则，同全世界各国工人，发展友好的、兄弟般的和团结互助的关系。
    它的内容可以概述如下：工人和全体人民团结一致，为当前的共同目标——消灭殖民主义而进行斗争。开发非洲，通过在各社会阶层之间公平合理地分配我国的财富来改善非洲人民的生活条件，就是说，进行有利于各社会阶层人民的非洲各国经济现代化和计划化。
    全体非洲人民都拥护这个纲领，他们为了争取实现其中的目标，正在进行热情的战斗。
    尽管遭受镇压，工会权利经常受到侵犯，然而为了重新夺回他们的主权，工人的斗争还是日趋激烈。
    在多哥，工人进行了强有力的罢工，反对合并法规，迫使法国政府不得不让步。在达喀尔，今年8月爆发了为时十七天的大罢工，使各业最低保证工资得到增加。在几内亚，畜牧业和农业工人举行了大罢工。在法属苏丹，尼日尔公司进行了罢工。
    另外一些其规模不减于上述罢工的行动，在目前正在酝酿中。
    同志们，所有这些斗争，都体现了在殖民主义枷锁下劳动群众的不可动摇的意志。在殖民主义枷锁下，任何妥协都是不可能的。
    非洲人民长期以来在惨无人道的剥削和文化压迫的制度奴役下，已经不能再忍受他们这种屈辱的仆从地位。他们从此认识到，只有获得解放，才能使自己的生活条件得到改善。
    我们也知道，作为资本主义最高阶段的帝国主义，由于本身不可克服的矛盾，在全世界进步力量迅速增长的形势面前显出软弱无能，它企图死守在最后一个堡垒：就是非洲大陆。
    但是，我们对我们所进行的斗争的胜利，充满信心，因为我们不是孤单的。
    你们的大会是全世界工人团结日益巩固的辉煌的证明。它更加说明了具有历史意义的、已成为世界普遍的真理的名言：“全世界无产者，联合起来”的伟大意义。
    我们祝贺你们的大会获得全面的胜利。中国同志们，感谢你们友好的邀请。
    全世界工人团结万岁！
    中国工会第八次全国代表大会万岁！
