Comrades:

    First of all, please allow me, on behalf of the Thai working class, to thank the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for inviting representatives of the Thai working class to attend the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions.

    Please also allow me to express my heartfelt gratitude to all the Chinese worker comrades who have given the representatives of the Thai working class warm friendship. The Thai working class is extremely pleased to receive your warm and fraternal close friendship.

    It is our sincere wish that the Thai working class and all peace-loving people of Thailand, regardless of all difficulties, will strive to establish close fraternal ties with the great Chinese people. At the beginning of this year, Thai worker representatives, art representatives, and sports representatives visited the People's Republic of China. After they returned to Thailand, they were warmly welcomed by the peace-loving people of Thailand. When they heard that Chinese comrades had received their representatives with brotherly kindness, they were even more delighted.

    They know very well that the warmth and friendship you have given to their representatives is the warmth and friendship given to the Thai people and the entire Thai working class. I believe that the close fraternal relationship and mutual understanding between the Chinese and Thai people are unbreakable, because our friendship and our mutual understanding come from the sincerity of both sides.

    Dear comrades, I would like to take this valuable opportunity of the convening of the Eighth National Congress of Trade Unions to express to you the hopes of the Thai working class and all peace-loving Thai people for Chinese comrades.

    The Thai working class and all peace-loving people are extremely pleased to see a kinsman-like neighboring country freed from the oppression of imperialism, moving towards progress and prosperity, and becoming an economically and culturally independent and free country. We know that the prosperity and progress of the peace-loving Chinese people will not only bring happiness to the Chinese people themselves, but will also be happiness and a good example for all nations around the world, especially those in Asia and Africa who are oppressed by American imperialism and its running dogs. We can say that the revolutionary achievements of the Chinese working class under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party are like the sunshine that will give the people of the world a bright morning. This sunshine will become increasingly bright, and give warmth to the people of the world, and in fact, it can be said that all oppressed nations are waiting for this warm sunshine.

    Imperialists and colonialists use such views to teach the oppressed people, saying that neither the colonies nor the people of Asia and Africa are capable of self-government and self-reliance. They instill these lies into the people in order to place all ethnic groups under their rule. But now, the great Chinese working class has proved to all oppressed countries that we all have the same abilities. The prosperity and progress of China created by the united strength of the Chinese working class under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party is a clear proof.

    Regarding the peaceful construction work carried out by the Chinese people and Chinese workers, I can say with great confidence that the people and workers of our country have always believed in and respected your peaceful ideals, because the situation of the Thai people and the Thai working class is no different from your situation before liberation. War and imperialism have given the Chinese and Thai people good lessons. We are especially convinced that comrades will become pioneers in consolidating world peace.

    I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the great Chinese people and the working class on their revolutionary victory and on their economic and cultural progress and prosperity. This is the wish of the Thai working class and the peace-loving Thai people who respect and firmly believe in the peaceful ideals of the Chinese people. Our people and the working class are firmly and gladly following the Chinese comrades in the struggle for peace and the construction of a new society and a new life of democratic human equality. Our friendship and mutual respect are firm in the establishment of world peace, especially peace in Asia. Let us maintain our great friendship and develop it into an eternal friendship.

    Long live the friendship and mutual understanding between the Chinese and Thai people!

    Long live the peaceful construction work of Chinese comrades!

    Long live world peace!

    泰国工人大会总书记
    乃素帕猜·西沙蒂致词敬爱的同志们：
    首先，请允许我代表泰国工人阶级，感谢中华全国总工会邀请泰国工人阶级的代表，参加中国工会第八次全国代表大会。
    请再允许我，向给予泰国工人阶级代表温暖的友谊的全中国工人同志，表示衷心的谢意。泰国的工人阶级当受到你们温暖的和兄弟般的密切友谊时，也感到万分高兴。
    泰国工人阶级和泰国一切爱好和平的人民，将不顾一切困难，争取同伟大的中国人民建立兄弟般的紧密联系，这是我们真诚的愿望。今年年初，泰国工人代表、艺术代表和体育代表曾来中华人民共和国访问，他们回泰国后，受到泰国爱好和平的人民热烈的欢迎。当他们听到中国同志兄弟般地亲切地接待他们的代表时，他们就更感到高兴。
    他们很清楚，你们给予他们的代表的温暖和友谊，也就是给予泰国人民和泰国全体工人阶级的温暖和友谊。我相信中泰人民兄弟般的紧密关系和相互了解，是牢不可破的，因为我们的友谊和我们的相互了解，是出自我们双方的真心诚意。
    亲爱的同志们：我想趁着在工会第八次全国代表大会召开的这个宝贵机会，向你们表达一下泰国工人阶级和一切爱好和平的泰国人民对中国同志的希望。
    泰国工人阶级和一切爱好和平的人民，万分高兴地看到亲戚般的邻邦摆脱帝国主义的压迫，走向进步和繁荣，成为一个经济上和文化上独立、自由的国家。我们知道，爱好和平的中国人民的繁荣进步，不仅将给中国人民自己带来幸福，而且将是全世界各个民族，特别是那些被美帝国主义及其走狗压迫的亚非国家的幸福和好榜样。我们可以说，在中国共产党领导下的中国工人阶级的革命成就，正像将给全世界人民以光明的早晨的阳光一样，这一阳光将日益光明，并给全世界的人民以温暖，而且事实上，可以说各被压迫民族都在等待着这一温暖的阳光。
    帝国主义和殖民主义者用这样的观点来教导被压迫人民，说：无论是殖民地或亚洲、非洲人民，都没有能力自治和自救。他们把这些谎话灌输给人民，以便把各族人民置于他们的统治下。但现在，伟大的中国工人阶级已经向各被压迫的国家证明：我们大家都有相同的能力。在中国共产党领导下，中国工人阶级的团结力量所造成的中国的繁荣和进步，就是一个明证。
    对于中国人民和中国工人所进行的和平建设工作，我可以很有把握地说，我们国家的人民和工人是一向相信和尊重你们这种和平理想的，因为泰国人民和工人阶级的情况和你们解放前的情况是没有什么不同的。战争和帝国主义已经给了中国和泰国人民很好的教训。我们还尤其坚信：同志们一定会成为巩固世界和平的先锋。
    我想趁此机会，祝贺伟大的中国人民和工人阶级取得革命的胜利，并在经济上和文化上获得进步繁荣。这就是尊重和坚信中国人民和平理想的泰国工人阶级和爱好和平的泰国人民的愿望。我们的人民和工人阶级，在争取和平和建设民主的人类平等的新社会和新生活中，正坚定地和欣然地跟随着中国同志走。在建立世界和平尤其是亚洲地区的和平中，我们的友谊和相互尊重是稳固的。让我们保持我们伟大的友谊，并且发展为永恒的友谊吧。
    中泰人民的友谊和相互了解万岁！
    中国同志的和平建设工作万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
