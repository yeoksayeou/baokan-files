    The members of the Russian delegation visiting China this time were mostly selected from cities such as Leningrad, Sverdlovsk, Kuibyshev, and Rostov, with a total of fourteen athletes (six men and eight women). Among them, the more famous is center Zhubkov, who is two meters and three centimeters tall. He participated in the 16th Olympic Games and the 3rd International Youth Friendship Games held in Melbourne last year. He is agile and has strong defensive capabilities. He is currently the starting center for the Soviet national team.

    The women's team also has strong strength. Before the visit, when they had practice games in Moscow, they defeated the Moscow "Dynamo" women's team. Soviet basketball experts commented that they are the fastest-improving team in the Soviet women's team.

    There are many tall players in the Russian men's and women's basketball teams, especially the women's team, with an average player height of one meter and seventy-three centimeters. The characteristics of these two teams are: fast speed, good teamwork, simple movements, and high shooting accuracy.

　　苏联俄罗斯男女篮球队到京
    本报讯　应邀来我国访问的苏联俄罗斯男女篮球队，在领队卡普托夫斯基率领下，已于18日到北京。他们是继1950年苏联国家篮球队来我国访问后第二次来我国访问的苏联篮球队。
    俄罗斯篮球队男子队有队员十二名，女子队有队员十三名。他们都是列宁格勒、罗斯托夫等地的著名运动员，男队员茹布科夫是苏联国家篮球队队员。
　　俄罗斯男女篮球队介绍
    俄罗斯男女篮球队是两支技术水平很高的球队。1954年参加各加盟共和国联赛时，俄罗斯女队获得了第十名，男队获得了第七名；过了一年，女队进为第七名，男队升到第五名。
    去年，在全苏各族人民运动大会上，俄罗斯男女篮球队表演更为出色。女队获得了分组冠军和决赛第六名，男队获得了分组亚军和决赛的第四名。
    这次来中国访问的俄罗斯代表队成员大部分是从列宁格勒、斯维德洛夫、古比雪夫和罗斯托夫等城市选拔出来的，共有十四名运动健将（男六名、女八名）。其中比较著名的是身高二公尺零三公分的中锋茹布科夫，他曾经参加过去年在墨尔本举行的十六届奥林匹克运动会和第三届国际青年友谊运动会。他动作灵活，防守能力强。目前他是苏联国家队的正选中锋。
    客队女队的实力也很强。来访之前，她们在莫斯科作练习赛时，曾打败了莫斯科“狄纳摩”女子队。苏联篮球专家评论她们是苏联女子队中进步最快的一队。
    俄罗斯男女篮球队身体高的队员很多，尤其是女队，平均队员身高一公尺七十三。这两个队的特点是：速度快，全队合作好，动作也很朴实，投篮命中率高。
