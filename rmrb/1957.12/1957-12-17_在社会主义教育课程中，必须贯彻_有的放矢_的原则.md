How should socialist education courses be taught to achieve the desired effect? This is a problem that urgently needs to be studied. We have no experience in this area yet, and we may need to go through multiple trials and explorations to find better methods in the future. However, no matter what, one principle must be adhered to and implemented, and that is what Comrade Mao Zedong has often taught us: the close integration of theory and practice. Comrade Mao Zedong once used an analogy: we study theory in order to shoot the arrow of Marxism-Leninism at the target of the Chinese revolution. We know that this is the only correct way to study Marxist-Leninist theory.

To realize the principle of "shooting the arrow at the target," the most important point is that all teaching measures must start from the ideological situation of the students. The students' ideological situation varies depending on the different student groups. After several months of rectification and the anti-Rightist struggle, we know that although the various fallacies of the bourgeois Rightists against the Communist Party and against socialism have been resolutely refuted, there are still some confused ideas on many fundamental issues such as the leadership of the Party and the proletarian dictatorship and socialist democracy. On many other specific issues, there is still a struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism. For example, in institutions of higher learning, there is a widespread debate about being "red" versus being "expert." The so-called "expert first, then red" is actually advocating being only expert and not red. This view is a bourgeois ideology. In various departments, units, industries, trades, and departments of higher education, the manifestations of bourgeois ideology have their own characteristics. For example, in the judicial sector, bourgeois ideology manifests itself as denying the proletarian dictatorship, rejecting the leadership of the Party, and other right-leaning and revisionist ideas of old legal viewpoints. In the education and science sectors, bourgeois ideology manifests itself as the idea that "laymen cannot lead experts," that "science has its own laws of development and does not need to be led or planned," and that some people do not study practical problems and only want to become famous. In the architectural design sector, bourgeois ideology manifests itself as many people one-sidedly pursuing aesthetics, attempting to design buildings that serve as "personal monuments," and opposing the principle of economy, practicality, and attention to aesthetics where possible. In the medical and health sectors, a few people have a bourgeois tendency to neglect politics, dislike treating common diseases, and only want to treat difficult and rare diseases and treat patients as experimental subjects. In the literary and art ranks, some people have bourgeois individualistic ideas such as pursuing fame and fortune, opposing the leadership of the Party, being bookish, and deviating from the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. If we conduct socialist education without exposing these specific manifestations of bourgeois ideology and criticizing them in a "shooting the arrow at the target" manner, that is, engaging in debate, but instead talking abstractly about "opposing bourgeois ideology," it is actually difficult to hit the key points of bourgeois ideology, and it is also difficult to achieve the goal of transforming the old ideas of intellectuals and raising the socialist consciousness of students.

How can we understand the various erroneous ideas existing among students in order to transform them in a "shooting the arrow at the target" manner? The best way is to fully unleash ideas and speak out freely. The experience of rectification proves that the forms of great airing, great blooming, great debate, and big-character posters are conducive to improving work, correcting errors and shortcomings in work, and stimulating the enthusiasm and initiative of the masses, and are conducive to the self-education of the masses and overcoming various erroneous ideas. When conducting socialist education courses, it is necessary to repeatedly explain to the students that socialist education is self-education and self-transformation within the people, and that bourgeois ideology and other erroneous ideas in people's minds objectively exist. If they are not transformed, they will not only not disappear naturally, but will also develop and cause greater harm. This is detrimental to the socialist cause and to one's own transformation. Through forms such as great airing, great blooming, great debate, and big-character posters, after repeated debates, mutual education, distinguishing between right and wrong, and achieving the goal of self-education and self-transformation, the bourgeois ideas in one's mind can be eliminated, socialist ideas can be established, and one can consciously stand on the position of the working class and truly achieve personal happiness. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to take various concrete measures to create various conditions conducive to airing and blooming, such as repeated mobilization, dispelling students' ideological concerns, and not adding any restrictions or "frameworks" to the content of airing and blooming; Party and League workers and political theory teachers should go deep among the students to grasp the situation and carry out mobilization work; various symposiums should be held in large and small groups, and necessary individual talks should be conducted; and Party and League members and activists should be encouraged to take the lead in speaking. After symposiums and big-character posters are widely unfolded, the leaders of schools or units must gather the various issues raised by students, especially the main ideological issues related to the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism, study them, so that in the later stage of in-depth study, they can guide students to repeatedly debate these issues, so that they can truly achieve "shooting the arrow at the target" in their study. Currently, many schools are doing this when they start socialist education courses. (The preliminary situation of the Central School for Political and Legal Cadres carrying out socialist education, published in this issue, is an example.)

In order to achieve the goal of "shooting the arrow at the target," in addition to understanding the students' ideological situation, we must also pay attention to implementing this spirit when guiding the reading of documents. Generally speaking, for the sake of easy understanding, we should guide students to first study the major practical problems raised in the documents, and leave some more difficult and abstract problems to be studied later. For example, when studying "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" on the "two different types of contradictions," we should first guide students to clarify the current boundary between the people and the enemy, that is, to first clarify that "at the present stage, in the period of socialist construction, all classes, strata, and social groups that support, endorse, and participate in the cause of socialist construction belong to the scope of the people; all social forces and social groups that resist the socialist revolution and are hostile to and sabotage socialist construction are enemies of the people," in order to first determine what is the working-class position and what is the bourgeois position. We should also guide students to study the important issues such as proletarian dictatorship and socialist democracy raised in this section. However, some comrades do not guide students to first study these practical problems, but guide students to first study philosophical problems in an abstract and isolated way. Doing so can easily lead to disputes over abstract nouns and concepts, especially among young intellectuals, which should be avoided.

### 在社会主义教育课程中，必须贯彻“有的放矢”的原则

　　在社会主义教育课程中，必须贯彻“有的放矢”的原则
    社会主义教育课程的教学，应该如何进行，才能够取得应有的效果，这是目前亟待研究的问题。我们在这一方面还没有经验，今后可能需要经过多次的试验和摸索，才能找到较好的方法。但是，不论怎样，有一条原则是必须坚持贯彻的，这就是毛泽东同志所经常教导我们的：理论和实际的密切结合。毛泽东同志曾经打比方说：我们学习理论，就是为了以马克思列宁主义之矢，射中国革命之的。我们知道，学习马克思列宁主义理论，只有这个方法才是正确的。
    为了实现“有的放矢”的方针，最重要的一点，就是一切教学措施，都必须从学员的思想情况出发。学员的思想情况，是随着不同的学员对象而有所不同的。经过几个月来的整风和反右派斗争，我们知道，尽管资产阶级右派分子反对共产党、反对社会主义的各种谬论，已经受到坚决的驳斥，可是，在关于党的领导，关于无产阶级专政和社会主义民主等许多根本问题上，都还存在着若干糊涂的思想。在其他许多具体问题上，还存在着社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争。例如，在高等院校中，普遍地存在着红与专问题的争论。所谓“先专后红”，实际上也就是主张只专不红。这种主张，就是一种资产阶级的思想。而在各机关、各单位、各行各业、高等院校的各个科系中，资产阶级思想的表现，则都带着各自的特点。例如，在司法部门中，资产阶级思想就表现为否认无产阶级专政，不要党的领导，以及其他各种旧法观点的右倾思想和修正主义思想。在教育和科学部门中，资产阶级思想就表现为所谓“外行不能领导内行”，所谓“科学有自己的发展规律，不必加以领导和规划”，和有些人不研究实际问题，一心只想成名成家。在建筑设计部门中，资产阶级思想表现为许多人片面追求美观，企图设计出作为“个人纪念碑”的建筑，而反对经济、适用、在可能条件下注意美观的方针。在医药卫生部门中，有少数人存在着忽视政治的资产阶级倾向，存在着不喜欢治疗常见疾病，而只愿意治疑难病症和把病人当作实验品的资产阶级恶劣作风。在文艺队伍中，有些人存在着追求名利、反对党的领导、一本书主义、脱离工农兵方向的资产阶级个人主义思想。我们进行社会主义教育，如果不把资产阶级思想的这些具体表现揭发出来，不是“有的放矢”地加以批判，进行争辩，而是抽象地谈论“反对资产阶级思想”，实际上是很难打中资产阶级思想的要害的，也很难达到改造知识分子的旧思想，提高学员的社会主义觉悟的目的。
    如何才能了解学员中间存在着的各种错误思想，以便“有的放矢”地加以改造呢？最好的方式就是大放大鸣。整风的经验证明：大鸣、大放、大辩论、大字报的形式，既有利于改进工作，纠正工作中的错误和缺点，又有利于启发群众的积极性和主动性，有利于群众的自我教育，克服各种错误思想。在进行社会主义教育课程的教学时，必须反复向学员说明：社会主义教育是人民内部的自我教育和自我改造，人们头脑中的资产阶级思想和其他错误思想，是客观存在着的，如果不加以改造，它不但不会自然地消失，反而会发展起来，引起更大的危害。这对社会主义事业是不利的，对自己的改造也是不利的。而通过大鸣、大放、大辩论、大字报等形式，经过反复辩论，互相教育，分清是非，达到自我教育和自我改造的目的，使自己头脑中的资产阶级思想清除出去，社会主义思想树立起来，就可以自觉地站到工人阶级立场上来，真正地达到个人心情愉快。为了达到这个目的，就必须采取各种具体的措施，造成各种有利鸣放的条件，例如反复动员、解除学员的思想顾虑，在鸣放的内容上，不要加上任何的限制或“框框”；党团工作人员和政治理论课教员应该深入学员中去，掌握情况，进行发动工作；召开大组小组各种座谈会，并且进行必要的个别交谈；鼓励党团员和积极分子带头发言。而在座谈会和大字报普遍展开起来以后，学校或单位的领导，必须把学员中鸣放出来的各种问题，特别是关系到社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争的主要思想问题，集中起来，进行研究，以便在以后深入学习的阶段，引导学员对这些问题进行反复的争辩，这样，才能真正做到“有的放矢”地进行学习。目前有许多学校在开始进行社会主义教育课程的时候，就是这样作的。（本刊本期刊载的中央政法干部学校进行社会主义教育的初步情况，就是一个例子。）
    为了达到“有的放矢”的目的，除了要了解学员的思想情况以外，在指导阅读文件的时候，也必须注意贯彻这一精神。一般说来，为了便于理解，我们应该引导学员首先研究文件中所提出的重大实际问题，而把一些比较难学的、抽象程度较高的问题，留在后面去研究。例如，在学习“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的“两类不同性质的矛盾”时，应该首先指导学员弄清当前人民和敌人的界限，也就是首先弄清“在现阶段，在建设社会主义的时期，一切赞成、拥护和参加社会主义建设事业的阶级、阶层和社会集团，都属于人民的范围；一切反抗社会主义革命和敌视、破坏社会主义建设的社会势力和社会集团，都是人民的敌人”，以便首先确定什么是工人阶级立场，什么是资产阶级立场，还应该引导学员研究这一节中所提出来的无产阶级专政和社会主义民主等重要问题。但是，有的同志不是引导学员首先研究这些实际问题，却引导学员首先去抽象地孤立地研究哲学问题。这样做的结果，很容易引导到抽象名词概念的争论，在青年知识分子当中尤其容易这样，这是应该注意避免的。
