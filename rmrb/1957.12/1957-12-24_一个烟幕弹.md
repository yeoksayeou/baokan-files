A Smoke Bomb
    On the one hand, the Kishi Nobusuke government of Japan attempts to accept the American "Sidewinder" missiles. On the other hand, it fears opposition from the people at home, and therefore tries its best to conceal its dangerous behavior, saying that accepting the missiles is a harmless matter.
    However, the Kishi Nobusuke government did not expect that the Associated Press would unintentionally reveal its true colors. A dispatch from Tokyo on the 21st by this news agency said: Since Japan has agreed to accept the American "Sidewinder" missiles, it is very likely that it will reach an "agreement" with the United States on "Nike" missile bases next year. It turns out that the United States first gave the "Sidewinder" missiles in order to build "Nike" missile bases in Japan next year! And the Kishi Nobusuke government's propaganda is nothing more than a smoke bomb. But as the Japanese saying goes, "Having borrowed the eaves, one loses the main house." The Japanese people will not be so easily fooled.

    一个烟幕弹
    日本岸信介政府一方面企图接受美国的“响尾蛇”式导弹，一方面又害怕遭到国内人民的反对，因而竭力为自己的危险行径进行掩饰，把接受导弹说成是无伤大雅的事。
    但是，岸信介政府没有想到合众社却无意中泄了它的底。这家通讯社21日发自东京的一条消息说：既然日本已经同意接受美国的“响尾蛇”式导弹，明年就很可能同美国就“奈克”式导弹基地达成“协议”了。原来，美国先给“响尾蛇”式导弹，为的是要在明年在日本建立“奈克”式导弹基地！而岸信介政府的宣传，不过是一个烟幕弹。但日本俗话说得好：“借了檐下，丢了正房”，日本人民是不会那末容易上当的。
