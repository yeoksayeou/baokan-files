In the rectification campaign, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, following the spirit of rectifying while correcting, established a system where cadres at the level of division and bureau chiefs and above handle letters from the people and receive visitors personally. Not long ago, Xie Juezai, Minister of Internal Affairs, personally replied to letters from Liu Hao and Deng Chenren requesting to go to the frontier to participate in construction. In his reply, Minister Xie provided detailed and patient education regarding their unrealistic idea of only hoping to be “eagles” in a storm in the frontier, and not being content with the current agricultural production. He explained that the “storm” was right beside them—the socialist great debate in the countryside, manure accumulation, water conservancy construction, and other agricultural production and construction. He hoped that they would settle down and work hard to build a new socialist countryside, striving to be "eagles" on the agricultural front. Prior to this, Guo Bingkun, Vice Minister of Internal Affairs, and Liu Jingxiu, Director of the Department of Preferential Treatment, had also personally replied to letters from the people.

Handling letters from the people and receiving visitors is an important method for Party and government organs to connect with the masses and with reality. Therefore, many leading comrades often read and respond to letters from the people. However, some leading cadres of the organs, due to their busy work schedules, find it difficult to spare time to directly handle letters from the people and receive visitors. The Ministry of Internal Affairs improved this work during the rectification campaign, following the spirit of rectifying while correcting. This is not only a great encouragement and education to the letter writers, but also strengthens the connection between leaders and the masses, effectively overcoming bureaucracy.

　　负责干部亲自处理来信
    内务部在整风中根据边整边改的精神，建立了司、局长以上的干部处理人民来信和接待来访的制度。不久以前内务部谢觉哉部长、就曾亲笔答复了刘豪、邓陈仁要求到边疆去参加建设的来信。在复信中，谢部长对他们只希望到边疆去做一个暴风雨中的“雄鹰”，而不安于眼前的农业生产的不现实想法进行了详细的耐心的教育，说明“暴风雨”就在他们的身边——农村中的社会主义大辩论、积肥、修水利等农业生产和农业建设，希望他们安心努力建设社会主义的新农村，争取在农业战线上做一个“雄鹰”。在此以前，内务部郭炳坤副部长和优抚局刘敬修局长都曾亲自答复过人民来信。
    处理人民来信和接待人民来访，是党和政府机关联系群众、联系实际的重要方法，因此，许多领导同志都经常阅读和批复人民来信。但有些机关负责干部由于工作繁忙，很难抽出时间直接处理人民来信和接待来访。内务部在整风中根据边整边改精神，改进了这一工作。这不但对来信者是很大的鼓舞和教育，而且密切了领导同群众的联系，有效地克服了官僚主义。
