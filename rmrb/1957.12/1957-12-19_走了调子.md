    Off-Key
    The North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit was forced to temporarily add an item to its agenda: Bulganin's letters to them.
    When these letters were published, the U.S. State Department spokesman, as usual, used the hackneyed phrase "it's just propaganda" to try to shelve this Soviet peace initiative. Dulles also repeatedly emphasized that negotiations with the Soviet Union were meaningless. At the opening of the Paris conference, the U.S. President, in his speech setting the "tone" for the meeting, deliberately avoided these letters, not mentioning them at all.
    However, as Associated Press reporters Curry and Gaver pointed out, there is a "growing public pressure" around the world to take the Soviet initiatives seriously. Therefore, "it is difficult to dismiss Bulganin's timely move, which is attracting the world, as propaganda."
    Some humorous foreign reporters called Bulganin's letters the "invisible attendee" of the Paris conference, because these letters distracted many participants of the Paris conference, making it difficult for the United States to keep them focused on discussing how to step up preparations for nuclear war according to Washington's plan.
    Eisenhower set the "tone" for the conference, but the Soviet peace initiative aroused widespread repercussions around the world, throwing the conference off-key. This is probably something that Mr. President did not anticipate.

    走了调子
    北大西洋公约国家首脑会议被迫临时给自己增加了一项议程：布尔加宁给他们的信件。
    当这些信件发表的时候，美国国务院发言人照例用“这不过是宣传”的滥调，想把苏联这个和平倡议搁在一边。杜勒斯也曾一再强调同苏联举行谈判没有任何意义。在巴黎会议开幕时，美国总统发言为会议规定“基调”，还故意避开了这些信件，一字不提。
    可是，像美联社记者柯里和加弗向指出的，世界各地有一种“越来越大的公众压力”，要求认真看待苏联的倡议，因此，要把布尔加宁的“恰当其时的吸引全世界的举动说成是宣传是困难的”。
    某些有幽默感的外国记者把布尔加宁的信称为巴黎会议的“无形的出席者”，因为这些信件使得巴黎会议的许多参加者分了心，美国要想让他们专心致意地讨论怎样按照华盛顿的计划加紧准备核战争的问题是难以办到的。
    艾森豪威尔给会议规定好“基调”，但是苏联的和平倡议在全世界引起了广泛反响，使会议走了调子。这恐怕也是这位总统先生所没有预料到的吧。　（胡）
