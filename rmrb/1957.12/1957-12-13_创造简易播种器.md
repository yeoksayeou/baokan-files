    The members of the Meilin Township Agricultural Cooperative in Nanjing County, Fujian Province, have recently created a light and simple seeder during the winter planting season. Each person can use this tool to sow wheat on about twelve mu per day, which is three times more efficient than hand sowing. The structure of this seeder is simple. It is made by tying a bamboo tube about one meter long, with joints opened and the end shaped into a tongue, to the opening of a cloth bag containing seeds. When sowing, the seed bag and bamboo tube are carried on the back like a sprayer. While walking, the bamboo tube is tapped with a small wooden stick, and the seeds flow from the cloth bag into the bamboo tube, and are evenly distributed through the three rows of tongue-shaped openings at the end of the bamboo tube, which are separated by bamboo strips. Now, 36 of these seeders have been copied in the Meilin Cooperative and neighboring agricultural cooperatives. (Xinhua News Agency)

    创造简易播种器
    福建省南靖县梅林乡农业社社员，最近在冬种中创造了一种轻便简易的播种器。每人每天可以用这种工具条播小麦十二亩左右，比手播效率提高三倍。这种播种器的构造简单，只要在盛放种子的布袋口上，缚上一根打通关节、尾端削成舌形的一公尺长左右的竹筒就成了。播种时，把种子袋和竹筒像背喷雾器一样地倒背在身上，边走边用小木棍敲打竹筒，种子就由布袋中流入竹筒里，均匀地通过竹筒尾端用竹片隔成三行的舌形缺口源源播出。现在梅林社和邻近的农业社已仿制了三十六架。（新华社）
