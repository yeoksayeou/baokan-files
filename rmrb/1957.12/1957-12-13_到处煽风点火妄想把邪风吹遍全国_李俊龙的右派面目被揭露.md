Xinhua News Agency, December 12th: The Central Rectification Office of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, based on the demands of the masses, recently held a conference to expose and criticize the anti-communist and anti-socialist words and deeds of the rightist Li Junlong (Standing Committee Member and Deputy Minister of the Organization Department of the Central Committee of the RCCK).

Li Junlong, using his position as a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, went everywhere stoking fires and collecting poisonous weeds during his inspections in various places. At symposiums during his inspections in Guangdong and Heilongjiang, he acted as if he were a central government official, saying he was there to collect internal contradictions of the people. At the symposiums, he even viciously provoked the relationship between the attendees and the leading cadres, saying, "The leaders are here, you don't dare to raise opinions," openly kicking out the Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and leading cadres present.

During the period of blooming and contending, Li Junlong wanted to spread the anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-socialist evil wind throughout the country. He said: "When I inspected Heilongjiang, there was no blooming and contending yet. I once said to the Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee that the spring breeze had not yet crossed the Shanhaiguan. When I inspected Changchun, there was already blooming and contending, and I said the spring breeze had arrived at Shanhaiguan. After returning to Beijing, from the Wenhui Daily, I saw that some places had not yet started blooming and contending. Sichuan only recently started blooming and contending; this is the spring breeze first crossing the Jianmenguan. Hunan had not yet started blooming and contending but already made many restrictive rules and regulations; it's closing up before even opening. I hope 'the spring breeze crosses the Wusheng Pass and ruffles the eight hundred miles of Dongting Lake.'"

Li Junlong spared no effort to attack socialist culture and the Communist Party's policy towards intellectuals. From the arrangement to the use of intellectuals, from university professors to elementary school teachers, from science to literature and art, from South China to the Northeast, he shot poisonous arrows everywhere. He slandered the Communist Party as incapable of leading science, claiming that there was no freedom of academic research in the new society, and clamored that "the administrative cadres of scientific research institutions are all Party and League members, who do not understand the profession and hinder the development of science." He also made the ideological remolding of intellectuals by the Party sound grim and terrible, saying that ideological remolding is "negating thought, negating professional knowledge, negating personality." He even frantically put forward the reactionary proposal of restricting the Communist Party from developing intellectual Party members, saying, "Now the Communist Party has twelve million Party members, but in the future, don't accept intellectuals into the Party so quickly," vainly attempting to fundamentally sever the connection between the Communist Party and intellectuals, and win over intellectuals as his capital for opposing communism, opposing the people, and opposing socialism.

Li Junlong also launched vicious attacks on the socialist legal system and personnel system. He slandered that cadres below the county level had no legal system. In his view, no matter what kind of mistakes the cadres made, they were all "imprisoned," "controlled," and "killed," and that is what is called having a "legal system." He attempted to direct the spearhead of the dictatorship at the internal affairs of the people, rather than at the enemies of the people.

On the one hand, Li Junlong was extremely hostile to the people and revolutionary cadres, but on the other hand, he tried his best to exonerate counter-revolutionaries, saying that "the Kuomintang's district branch members are not counter-revolutionary backbones," and that "the Kuomintang's district branch is a confused district branch," and so on. He even closed his eyes to the provisions of the Constitution regarding our country's safeguarding of the people's democratic system and the suppression of all counter-revolutionary activities, and actually said that "such an important issue as the suppression of counter-revolutionaries should not be passed by the National People's Congress," attempting to portray the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement as illegal.

The meeting also revealed many facts about Li Junlong using his position as Deputy Minister of the Organization Department of the Central Committee of the RCCK to attempt to tamper with the political direction and organizational line of the RCCK, and turn the RCCK into a political tool for rightists.

### 到处煽风点火妄想把邪风吹遍全国  李俊龙的右派面目被揭露

    到处煽风点火妄想把邪风吹遍全国
    李俊龙的右派面目被揭露
    新华社12日讯　中国国民党革命委员会中央整风办公室根据群众的要求，最近举行大会对右派分子李俊龙（民革中央常务委员兼组织部副部长）反共反社会主义言行进行揭露和批判。
    李俊龙利用政协全国委员会委员的身份，在各地视察的时候到处煽风点火，搜集毒草。他在广东和黑龙江两次视察座谈会上，俨然以中央大员自居，说是来搜集人民内部矛盾的。他在座谈会上甚至恶毒地挑拨到会人员和领导干部的关系说：“领导在场，你们不敢提意见”，公然把到会的共产党员、共青团员和领导干部一齐轰了出去。
    在鸣放期间，李俊龙要把反共、反人民、反社会主义的邪风吹遍全国。他说：“我在黑龙江视察时，那里还没有鸣放，我曾对省委书记说，春风未度山海关。我到长春视察时，那里已在鸣放，我说春风已到山海关。回到北京后，从文汇报看，有的地方还未鸣放起来，四川最近才鸣放起来，这是春风初度剑门关。湖南未鸣放起来就定出许多清规戒律，是未放先收，我希望“春风度过武胜关，吹皱八百里洞庭”。
    李俊龙不遗余力地攻击社会主义文化和共产党对知识分子的政策。从对知识分子的安排到使用，从大学教授到小学教员，从科学到文艺，从华南到东北，他都到处施放毒箭。他诬蔑共产党不能领导科学，新社会没有学术研究自由，叫嚣“科学研究机关的行政干部都是党、团员，不懂业务，妨碍科学的发展”。他还把党对知识分子的思想改造说得阴森可怕，说思想改造就是“否定思想，否定业务知识，否定人格”。甚至疯狂地提出限制共产党发展知识分子党员的反动主张，说什么“现在共产党有一千二百万党员，今后接受知识分子入党不要那么快”，妄图根本割断共产党同知识分子的联系，争取知识分子作为他反共、反人民、反社会主义的资本。
    李俊龙对社会主义法制和人事制度也进行了恶毒的攻击。他污蔑县以下的干部没有法制，在他看来，不管干部犯了什么性质的错误，一律加以“关”“管”“杀”，这才叫作有“法制”。他企图把专政的锋芒指向人民的内部，而不是指向人民的敌人。
    李俊龙一方面对人民、对革命干部十分仇视，一方面却尽量为反革命分子开脱，说什么“国民党的区分部委员，并不是反革命骨干”，“国民党的区分部是糊涂的区分部”等等。他甚至闭眼不看宪法关于我国保卫人民民主制度、镇压一切反革命活动的规定，竟说“像肃反这样重要的问题，不通过人民代表大会是不对的”，企图把肃反运动说成是违法的。
    会上还揭露了李俊龙利用民革中央组织部副部长的身分，企图篡改民革的政治方向和组织路线，使民革变为右派分子的政治工具的许多事实。
