    The Moscow meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries was held just over a month ago. One can clearly see that the solemn appeal in the Moscow meeting's declaration to "give peace to the world," together with the successful launch of two Soviet artificial satellites, has had a huge and far-reaching impact. The struggle of peace-loving people in all countries against the arms race and for world peace has seen new developments. Especially in Western European countries, the call for an end to the "Cold War" and for negotiations between Eastern and Western countries comes not only from the broad masses of working people, but also from many social celebrities, entrepreneurs, and political figures. Western bourgeois newspapers no longer shy away from saying that "neutralism" and "nationalism" are on the rise among America's allies. Even in the United States, there are many insightful people who are asking the Eisenhower government to change its current foreign policy. However, at the same time, the American ruling group is trying to use the impact of the Soviet artificial satellites to stir up a frenzy of arms expansion and war preparation, in order to save its bankrupt "position of strength" policy.
    The NATO summit held in this situation, on the one hand, reflected the resistance of many Western European governments to the American policy of arms expansion and war preparation, under the pressure of social public opinion demanding peace. On the other hand, it also reflected the desperate struggle of the American ruling group to stubbornly continue the Cold War and the arms race. The result of the meeting indicates that the American ruling group's plans to refuse negotiations with the Soviet Union and to force Western European countries to accelerate arms expansion and war preparation have failed. Although the meeting's communiqué mentioned "in principle agreements" on storing nuclear weapons in Western Europe, establishing missile bases, and coordinating arms production, it could not but express its willingness to hold a five-nation foreign ministers' meeting with the Soviet Union on disarmament issues.
    The resolutions of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, as well as Comrade Khrushchev's speech and Comrade Gromyko's statement at the meeting, are a clear and powerful response to the NATO summit. The Soviet Union believes that the five-nation foreign ministers' meeting has proven in the past few years to be an institution that obstructs rather than promotes the implementation of universal disarmament by the US-British bloc, and refuses to participate in such fruitless meetings. The Soviet Union reiterated its initiative to stop the arms race and implement peaceful coexistence, mainly: (1) The Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom should stop nuclear weapons testing from January 1, 1958; (2) The Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom should not use nuclear weapons; (3) The Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom should not deploy any kind of nuclear weapons in East Germany, West Germany, Poland, and Czechoslovakia; (4) All countries, especially the major powers, should greatly reduce the number of armed forces and armaments; (5) Participants in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and participants in the Warsaw Treaty should conclude a mutual non-aggression pact; (6) Force must not be used to solve the Middle East problem, and the independence of Middle East countries must not be undermined; (7) Heads of government of socialist and capitalist countries should hold a meeting, preceded by a meeting of representatives of the Soviet Union and the United States.
    As pointed out in the declaration of the Moscow meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries, "War or peaceful coexistence has become the fundamental issue of world politics." These initiatives of the Soviet government point the way to ending the Cold War, easing international tensions, stopping the arms race, and implementing peaceful coexistence. This is another constructive and major effort by the Soviet government to implement its consistent peaceful foreign policy, and it also expresses the spirit of the Moscow meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries and their sincere desire for world peace. Poland, the German Democratic Republic, and Czechoslovakia have expressed their support for the Soviet initiatives, especially the initiative to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. Our government has issued a statement fully supporting these important measures proposed by the Soviet government to safeguard world peace. The question now is whether the imperialist countries, headed by the United States, will recognize reality and accept the Soviet proposals, or whether they will stubbornly continue the "Cold War" policy and expand arms and prepare for war for the benefit of a small handful of monopoly capitalists?
    As long as people calmly study the Soviet Union's various peace proposals, they can clearly see that the Soviet Union has no intention of threatening others by relying on its military advantage of mastering the latest weapons. On the contrary, in view of the development of modern weapons which may bring unprecedented destruction to all mankind in a war, the Soviet Union strives to reach an agreement to ban the use of these weapons. The Soviet Union has no intention of invading others. On the contrary, it actively advocates peaceful coexistence. The sincere desire of the Soviet Union to seek world peace is so clear and firm that even influential people in the United States, such as former Ambassador to the Soviet Union Kennan and financial magnate Eaton, agree to negotiate with the Soviet Union. If the American ruling group really hopes for world peace, as Eisenhower said in his Christmas broadcast, then it should fully accept the Soviet proposals. As many Western newspapers and social celebrities have said, what is wrong with the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom agreeing to stop testing and ban the use of nuclear weapons? Especially at a time when the Soviet Union already has intercontinental missiles while the United States and the United Kingdom do not, is this not beneficial to the United States and the United Kingdom without any harm? What is wrong with establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe? Is this not also beneficial without any harm at a time when the United States and the United Kingdom do not even have medium-range missiles? What is wrong with all countries, especially the major powers, implementing universal disarmament? Has not the Western bloc headed by the United States already lagged far behind the Soviet Union in terms of armaments? Is not the implementation of universal disarmament beneficial to the United States and the United Kingdom without any harm? What is wrong with holding negotiations with the Soviet Union and socialist countries to achieve peaceful coexistence? Has not someone in the United States said that if a war breaks out now, the United States homeland will suffer? Many more questions of this kind can be raised. In short, if the American authorities are not planning for the high profits of a few monopoly groups who make fortunes through the arms race and war, if they are planning for the interests of the entire American people, including the interests of those entrepreneurs who advocate peaceful competition, what reason do they have not to accept the Soviet Union's peace proposals?
    However, after the NATO summit, the actions of the American authorities are contrary to peace. The powerful monopoly groups in the United States are stirring up a new frenzy of the arms race. At a meeting, US Vice President Nixon, using the pretext of new achievements in Soviet science and technology, clamored about the "Soviet threat" and demanded that the American people "tighten their belts," "make sacrifices," and "shed blood, sweat, and tears." US Senate Democratic leader Johnson demanded that the American people extend working hours and implement a "full wartime mobilization schedule" to manufacture missiles. Some even advocate "preemptive" war. Foster, the host of the notorious "Gaither Committee Report," is one such warmonger. The White House is busy drafting plans for arms expansion and planning to establish medium-range missile bases in Western Europe and the United States. It seems that the American ruling group is planning to accelerate the arms race, trying to catch up with the Soviet Union, restore its shattered "deterrent force," and prepare for a new war.
    What will the arms race ultimately bring to the United States? Will the American ruling group's wishful thinking come true?
    People may wish to review the experience since the end of World War II. In the past ten years or so, the United States has been pursuing a policy of arms expansion and war preparation aimed at dominating the world, spending huge sums of money on a frenzied arms race, organizing military blocs, and establishing military bases everywhere. On the one hand, American imperialism has done this in order to place more countries under its enslavement, and on the other hand, it has done this in order to launch a war of aggression against the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union when the time comes. But what was the result? Facts show that despite the great efforts the United States has spent on the arms race, it has not only failed to surpass the Soviet Union further, but even failed to maintain its advantage in armaments ten years ago. Not only has it long lost the atomic weapons advantage it once monopolized, but now it has fallen far behind the Soviet Union in terms of the latest modern weapons. The US medium-range missiles are stillborn, let alone intercontinental missiles. Western military experts have admitted that in the face of the latest weapons, US overseas bases and strategic air forces have lost their so-called "deterrent" effect. And in order to expand arms and prepare for war, the United States has spent more than 300 billion US dollars, and the total military expenditure of the NATO countries has increased more than twofold in the past eight or nine years. The huge military expenditure has brought serious adverse consequences to the national economies of the United States and its allies. The US government's debt is high, reaching an unprecedented record of 270 billion US dollars, prices are constantly rising, taxes are constantly increasing, and the lives of the broad masses of working people are becoming increasingly difficult. The only ones who have benefited from the arms expansion and war preparation are a small handful of monopoly capitalists who have obtained tens of billions of huge profits. Now, the United States is definitely behind the Soviet Union in terms of the latest weapons and the most important science and technology. The famous American physicist Taylor believes that the United States is ten years behind the Soviet Union, and some say it is five years behind. Whether it is ten years or five years, the question is whether the United States can change this backward state in five or ten years. This is not something that can be determined by subjective wishful thinking, but is determined by the issue of the social system. The superiority of socialism has enabled the Soviet Union to change from backward to advanced in the above aspects, and in the future, the Soviet Union will definitely and inevitably advance at a faster pace on the basis of its already advanced scientific and technological level and strong economic foundation. Even if the United States goes all out and may manufacture intercontinental missiles and launch artificial satellites, by that time, the Soviet Union will have greatly surpassed its current level and will have far surpassed the United States again. Even many Westerners see this as a foregone conclusion. French professor La Ville said: "Is it possible for the United States to change this backward state after all? This is extremely unlikely, because the scientific education that the Russians give their youth has always been much better than that of the Americans. The Soviet Union trains two or three times more engineers than the United States every year. Therefore, there is simply no reason to think that in the next ten years, the Russians will sleep soundly and not work hard to maintain their advanced position."
    To put it mildly, even if the United States catches up with the Soviet Union in terms of the latest armaments and the most important science and technology, what will happen? At that time, will the United States be able to win the war against the Soviet Union and socialist countries? History can answer this question correctly. We have always believed that the final result of war is determined by the nature of the war, by the direction of people's hearts, and that weapons cannot determine the final victory or defeat of war. No matter how new and large a number of weapons the United States has, it will never be able to win the war. However, Western strategists do not believe this. They believe more in their material things. They always like to boast about how many tons of steel the United States has, and believe that this is their greatest magic weapon for winning the victory of the war. Well, let's put aside the above and talk about whether steel plays a decisive role in the war. People remember that at the beginning of the establishment of the Soviet regime, the annual output of steel was only three million tons, but it was subjected to the armed intervention of the fourteen invading armies, which had far more military advantages, and there were also White bandits causing trouble internally. But what was the result? It was not the newly established and seemingly weak Soviet regime that failed, but the foreign interventionists. People also remember that during the Second World War, German fascism swept across the European continent, with a total annual steel output of 45 million tons, while the Soviet Union's annual steel output before the war was only 18 million tons. German fascism relied on this advantage and attempted to defeat the Soviet Union in one fell swoop. At that time, the United States and the United Kingdom, although possessing an annual steel output of 70 million tons, were constantly beaten by German fascism, suffering repeated defeats, and had to find the Soviet Union for help, first holding the Tehran Conference, and then holding the Yalta Conference, asking the Soviet Union to take the lead in the anti-fascist war. And after losing a large area of territory in the early stages of the war, the Soviet Union's annual steel output at that time was only about 9 million tons. However, the end of the war was still the victory of the Soviet Union. People also remember that after the Second World War, the socialist forces once carried out a large-scale contest with the imperialist forces. This was the Korean War. American imperialism personally came forward, carrying the banner of the "United Nations Army," and deploying millions of troops, not only with hundreds of millions of tons of steel as backing, but also with atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs. It was truly invincible. No wonder MacArthur had set the arrogant plan of occupying the entire North Korea within three weeks. However, after three years of competition, the American invading army retreated to the south of the 38th parallel and finally agreed to the armistice. The historical facts have proved that merely material advantages, the advantages of steel, and the advantages of armaments cannot guarantee the victory of the war. The victory or defeat of the war is determined by the nature of the war. Victory belongs to the just side, and victory belongs to the people. Therefore, the arms race is not a way out for the United States. If it insists on going its own way, then what awaits it will be as stated in the declaration of the Moscow meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries: "If the imperialist war maniacs insist on launching a war at all costs, then imperialism is doomed to perish, because the people will never continue to tolerate the system that brings them such heavy pain and sacrifice."
    Where is the way out? Only by recognizing reality, recognizing the reality of the coexistence of the socialist system and capitalism, and accepting peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition. Have not Dulles and his ilk been boasting about the "Western civilization" and the superiority of the capitalist system? Dulles recently said that the production level of the NATO countries per capita is much higher than that of the socialist countries, and he said that this is the capital for the West to fight against the socialist countries. Then, okay, if you really think that your capitalist system is superior to the socialist system, what dare you not abandon the "Cold War," dare you not stop the arms race, and engage in peaceful competition? The people of socialist countries believe that the socialist system is far superior to the capitalist system. We have no intention of aggression. What we are concerned about is engaging in peaceful labor, building our own country, and improving the material and cultural living standards of the people. The Soviet Union has announced that it is ready to catch up with and surpass the United States in the most important products within fifteen years. We Chinese people have also made up our minds to catch up with or surpass the United Kingdom in steel and other important industrial products in about fifteen years. Which social system is better? Let's compete in peace and see who is better. Is this not much better for the United States, the United Kingdom, and other Western countries than a hopeless arms race and war adventure?
    The matter could not be clearer. World history has developed to a new turning point, as Chairman Mao Zedong said, "The East wind prevails over the West wind." The peace-loving people of all countries are fighting for the cause of world peace with full confidence. The slogan of the forces for world peace is: We want peaceful coexistence, not an arms race! As Khrushchev said at the meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union: "We will do everything possible to make the coming year 1958 a year of peace, a year of decline or complete elimination of the 'Cold War,' so that people can live a life without worrying about their own fate, the fate of their children, wives, and mothers. Let the two systems compete on a peaceful basis, on the basis of economic and cultural upsurges and more fully meeting the material and spiritual needs of the people."

### 要和平共处，不要军备竞赛

    要和平共处，不要军备竞赛
    各国共产党和工人党的莫斯科会议距离现在才不过一个多月，人们可以清楚地看到，莫斯科会议的宣言中提出的“给世界以和平”的庄严的呼吁，连同苏联两颗人造卫星发射成功，已经发生了巨大的深远的影响。各国爱好和平人民反对扩军备战、争取世界和平的斗争有了新的发展。特别是在西欧各国，要求结束“冷战”、东西方国家举行谈判的呼声，不仅发自广大劳动人民，而且也发自许多社会名流、企业家和政界人物。西方资产阶级报纸已不讳言，“中立主义”和
  “民族主义”正在美国的盟国中抬头。甚至在美国国内，也有不少明达人士要求艾森豪威尔政府改变现行的外交政策。但是，与此同时，美国的统治集团企图利用苏联人造卫星上了天的影响，煽动扩军备战的歇斯底里，挽救它的“实力地位”政策的破产。
    在这种形势下召开的北大西洋集团最高会议，一方面反映了要求和平的社会舆论压力下的西欧许多国家政府对美国扩军备战政策的抗拒，另一方面又反映了美国统治集团顽固地企图继续进行冷战和军备竞赛的绝望的挣扎。会议的结果表示，美国统治集团拒绝同苏联谈判和压迫西欧各国加速扩军备战的打算落空了。会议的公报尽管提到了关于在西欧储存核武器、建立导弹基地以及统筹军备生产的“原则协议”，但是也不能不表示愿意同苏联举行关于裁军问题的五国外长会议。
    苏联最高苏维埃会议的决议以及在会议上赫鲁晓夫同志的讲话和葛罗米柯同志的声明，是对北大西洋集团最高会议的明确有力的回答。苏联认为五国外长会议在过去几年的工作中证明它只是美英集团阻挠而不是促进实行普遍裁军的机构，拒绝参加这样毫无结果的会议。苏联重申停止军备竞赛和实行和平共处的倡议，主要是：（一）苏、美、英三国从1958年1月1日起停止核武器的试验；（二）苏、美、英不使用核武器；（三）苏、美、英不在东德、西德、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克境内配置任何种类的核武器；（四）各国首先是各大国大大裁减武装部队的人数和军备；（五）北大西洋集团参加国和华沙条约参加国订立互不侵犯协定；（六）不得使用武力解决中近东问题和不得破坏中近东国家的独立；（七）社会主义国家和资本主义国家政府首脑举行会议，在这个会议之前先举行苏美两国代表的会议。
    正如社会主义国家共产党和工人党莫斯科会议宣言中指出的，“是战争还是和平共处，已经成为世界政治的根本问题。”苏联政府的这些创议，为结束冷战、缓和国际紧张局势、停止军备竞赛、实行和平共处指出了方向。这是苏联政府执行其一贯的和平外交政策的又一次建设性的重大努力，也表达了社会主义国家共产党和工人党莫斯科会议的精神以及它们谋求世界和平的真诚愿望。波兰、德意志民主共和国和捷克斯洛伐克已表示支持苏联的创议，特别是关于在中欧建立没有核武器的地区的创议。我国政府已发表声明，完全支持苏联政府提出的旨在维护世界和平的这些重要措施。现在的问题是以美国为首的帝国主义国家，承认现实，接受苏联的建议呢？还是继续顽固地为了一小撮垄断资本家的利益，而继续“冷战”政策，扩军备战呢？　
    人们只要平心静气地研究一下苏联的各项和平建议，就可以清楚地看到，苏联没有凭借掌握最新式武器的军事优势来威胁别人的任何意图，相反地，苏联鉴于近代武器的发展可能在一次战争中给全人类带来空前的破坏，力求达成禁止使用这些武器的协议；苏联没有侵略别人的任何意图，相反地，它积极主张和平共处。苏联谋求世界和平的真诚愿望是如此明确和坚定，甚至美国的有势力人士如前驻苏大使凯南、金融巨头之一伊顿都赞成同苏联进行谈判。如果美国统治集团真的像艾森豪威尔在圣诞节广播中所说的那样希望世界和平，那就应该完全接受苏联的建议。正如西方许多报纸和社会名流所说的，苏、美、英三大国协议停止试验和禁止使用核武器，有什么不好呢？特别是在目前苏联已经有了而美英没有洲际导弹的情况下，这不是对美国和英国有利而无害吗？在中欧建立无核武器地带，有什么不好呢？这在美英目前连中程导弹也没有的情况下不是也是有利而无害吗？各国特别是大国实行普遍裁军有什么不好呢？以美国为首的西方集团不是已经在军备方面大大落在苏联后面吗？实行普遍裁军不是对美英有利而无害吗？同苏联和社会主义国家举行谈判以实现和平共处有什么不好呢？美国不是有人说如果目前发生战争美国本土就要遭殃吗？诸如此类的问题还可以提出很多。总而言之，如果美国当局不是为少数借军备竞赛和战争发财的垄断集团的高额利润打算，如果它是为美国的全民利益打算，也包括为那些赞成和平竞赛的企业家的利益打算，它还有什么理由不接受苏联的和平建议呢？
    但是，在北大西洋集团最高会议以后，美国当局的所作所为，却是同和平相背悖的。美国的有势力的垄断集团正在煽动着新的军备竞赛的狂热。美国副总统尼克松在一次会议上，借口苏联科学技术的新成就，叫嚷“苏联威胁”，要求美国人民“勒紧腰带”，“作出牺牲”，“流血、流汗、流泪”。美国参议院民主党领袖约翰逊，要求美国人民延长工作时间，实行一个“充分的战时动员时间表”来制造导弹。甚至有人主张“先发制人”的战争，恶名昭著的“盖瑟委员会报告”的主持人福斯特就是这样的战争狂人之一。白宫正在忙着拟订扩军计划，忙着筹划在西欧和美国本土建立中程导弹基地。看来，美国统治集团是在打算加速进行军备竞赛，企图赶上苏联，恢复它已经破灭了的“威慑力量”，准备新的战争。
    军备竞赛究竟会给美国带来什么结果？美国统治集团的如意算盘能不能如愿以偿呢？
    人们不妨回顾一下第二次世界大战结束以来的经历。在过去的十多年间，美国一直是执行着以称霸世界为目的的扩军备战政策，不惜耗费巨额的金钱进行疯狂的军备竞赛，组织军事集团，到处建立军事基地。美帝国主义这样做，一方面是为了把更多的国家置于它的奴役之下，另一方面也是为了在时机到来的时候发动对以苏联为首的社会主义国家的侵略战争。可是，结果如何呢？事实表明，尽管美国花了偌大的气力进行军备竞赛，它非但没有能够更远地超过苏联，而且连十年前在军备方面的优势也保持不住，不但它曾一度垄断过的原子武器优势早已丧失了，到现在，并且在现代最新的武器方面已经远远落在苏联后面了。美国的中程导弹尚在难产之中，更不用说洲际导弹了。西方的军事家已承认，在最新的武器面前，美国的海外基地呀、战略空军呀，都已经丧失了所谓“威慑”的作用。而为了扩军备战，美国已经花了三千多亿美元，北大西洋集团各国军费总额在过去八、九年间增加了两倍多。庞大的军费支出，为美国及其盟国的国民经济带来了严重的恶果。美国政府债台高筑，已达二千七百亿美元的空前纪录，物价不断上涨，税收不断增加，广大劳动人民生活日益困难。从扩军备战中唯一得到好处的，只是一小撮的垄断资本家获得了成百亿的巨额利润。现在，美国比起苏联来，在最新式的武器方面和在最重要的科学技术方面肯定地落后了。美国著名物理学家泰勒认为美国比苏联落后了十年，也有人说是落后了五年。不管十年也罢、五年也罢，问题在于美国再过五年、十年能不能改变这种落后状态。这不是什么主观愿望所能决定的，而是决定于社会制度的问题。社会主义的优越性，已经使苏联在上述方面从落后变为先进，而今后，苏联将在已经达到的先进的科学技术水平和强大的经济基础上，肯定地必然以更快的速度前进。即使美国全力以赴，并且可能制造出洲际导弹和发射人造卫星，但是，到那个时候，苏联又将大大地超过现在的水平，又远远地把美国抛在后面了。这种定局，就连许多西方人士也是这样看的。法国教授拉维尔?就说：“美国究竟是否改变得了这种落后状态呢？这是极不可能的，因为俄国人使他们的青年所受到的科学教育一向比美国人好得多。苏联每年培养出的工程师比美国多两三倍。因此，根本没有理由认为：今后十年中，俄国人会睡大觉，而不努力保持自己的先进地位。”
    退一万步讲，即使美国在最新式的军备方面、在最重要的科学技术方面赶上了苏联，又能怎么样呢？那时候，是不是美国就能够在发动对苏联和社会主义国家的战争取得胜利了呢？历史能够正确地回答这个问题。我们一贯认为，战争的最后结果，决定于战争的性质，决定于人心的背向，武器并不能决定战争的最后胜负。美国不论有怎样新式的大量的武器，也是决不能取得战争的胜利的。但是，西方的谋士们并不相信这点，他们更相信他们的物质。他们总是喜欢吹嘘美国有多少吨钢，并且相信这是他们赢得战争的胜利的最大的法宝。好罢，我们姑且撇开上述的不谈，就来谈谈钢铁究竟在战争中是否起决定的作用罢。人们记得，苏维埃政权成立之初，钢的年产量只有三百万吨，却遭到了拥有比这不知大多少倍的和军备优势的十四国侵略军的武装干涉，并且还有白匪作乱于内。可是，结果呢？失败的不是刚刚成立不久、表面看来很弱小的苏维埃政权，而是外国干涉者。人们又记得，在第二次世界大战期间，德国法西斯席卷了欧洲大陆，钢的年产量共达四千五百万吨，而苏联在战前钢的年产量才不过一千八百万吨，德国法西斯就恃着这种优势，企图一举打垮苏联。那时候的美国和英国，虽然拥有年产七千万吨的钢，但也不断挨德国法西斯的打，连吃败仗，只好找苏联想办法，先开了一个德黑兰会议，后开了一个雅尔塔会议，请苏联担当反法西斯战争的主力。而苏联在战争初期丧失了大片国土以后，当时钢年产量只剩下九百万吨左右了。可是，战争的结局，还是苏联胜利了。人们又还记得，在第二次世界大战后，社会主义力量曾经同帝国主义力量进行了一次大规模的较量。这就是朝鲜战争。美帝国主义亲自出马，打着“联合国军”的旗子，兴百万之师，不但有上亿吨的钢为后盾，还有原子弹、氢弹，真可谓不可一世，难怪麦克阿瑟定出了三个星期内占领整个北朝鲜的狂妄计划了。可是，较量了三年，美国侵略军败退到三八线以南，终于同意了停战。历史的事实证明了，仅仅是物质的优势、钢铁的优势、军备的优势，并不能保证战争的胜利。战争的胜败，却决定于战争的性质。胜利属于正义的一方，胜利属于人民。因之，军备竞赛，对美国来说，并不是一条出路。如果一意孤行的话，那么，等着它的，就将如社会主义国家共产党和工人党莫斯科会议宣言所说的：“如果帝国主义的战争狂人硬要不顾一切发动战争，那么帝国主义就注定灭亡，因为人民绝不会再继续容忍那个给他们带来如此惨重的痛苦和牺牲的制度。”
    出路何在？只有承认现实，承认社会主义制度同资本主义共存的现实，接受和平共处，和平竞赛。杜勒斯之流不是一直在夸耀“西方文明”、夸耀资本主义制度的优越性吗？杜勒斯最近还说北大西洋公约国家生产水平按人口计算比社会主义国家要高得多，他说这是西方同社会主义国家进行斗争的本钱。那么，好吧，如果你们当真认为你们的资本主义制度比社会主义制度优越的话，有什么不敢放弃“冷战”，不敢停止军备竞赛，进行和平竞赛呢？社会主义国家人民认为社会主义制度远比资本主义制度优越，我们没有任何侵略意图，我们所关心的是进行和平的劳动，建设自己的国家，增进人民的物质生活和文化生活水平。苏联已经宣布，准备在十五年内，在最重要产品方面赶上并且超过美国。我们中国人民也立下了决心，要在十五年左右的时间内在钢铁及其他重要工业产品方面赶上或者超过英国。究竟那种社会制度好，让我们在和平竞赛中见个高下吧。这对于美国、英国以及其他西方国家来说，岂不是比没有希望的军备竞赛和战争冒险好得多吗？
    事情已经再清楚也不过了。世界历史已经发展到新的转折点，正如毛泽东主席所说的，“东风压倒西风”。各国爱好和平人民正满怀信心地为世界和平事业而奋斗。世界和平力量的口号是：要和平共处，不要军备竞赛！正像赫鲁晓夫在苏联最高苏维埃会议上所说的：“我们将竭尽一切努力使即将到来的1958年成为和平的一年，成为‘冷战’衰落或完全消除的一年，让人们能过不为自己的命运、不为自己的孩子、妻子和母亲的命运感到不安的生活。让两个体系在和平的基础上，在经济和文化高涨、更充分地满足人们物质和精神需要的基础上展开竞赛。”
