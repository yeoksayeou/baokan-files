    The Moscow meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries was held just over a month ago. One can clearly see that the solemn appeal in the Moscow meeting's declaration to "give peace to the world," together with the successful launch of two Soviet artificial satellites, has had a huge and far-reaching impact. The struggle of peace-loving people in all countries against the arms race and for world peace has seen new developments. Especially in Western European countries, the call for an end to the "Cold War" and for negotiations between Eastern and Western countries comes not only from the broad masses of working people, but also from many social celebrities, entrepreneurs, and political figures. Western bourgeois newspapers no longer shy away from saying that "neutralism" and "nationalism" are on the rise among America's allies. Even in the United States, there are many insightful people who are asking the Eisenhower government to change its current foreign policy. However, at the same time, the American ruling group is trying to use the impact of the Soviet artificial satellites to stir up a frenzy of arms expansion and war preparation, in order to save its bankrupt "position of strength" policy.
    The NATO summit held in this situation, on the one hand, reflected the resistance of many Western European governments to the American policy of arms expansion and war preparation, under the pressure of social public opinion demanding peace. On the other hand, it also reflected the desperate struggle of the American ruling group to stubbornly continue the Cold War and the arms race. The result of the meeting indicates that the American ruling group's plans to refuse negotiations with the Soviet Union and to force Western European countries to accelerate arms expansion and war preparation have failed. Although the meeting's communiqu√© mentioned "in principle agreements" on storing nuclear weapons in Western Europe, establishing missile bases, and coordinating arms production, it could not but express its willingness to hold a five-nation foreign ministers' meeting with the Soviet Union on disarmament issues.
    The resolutions of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, as well as Comrade Khrushchev's speech and Comrade Gromyko's statement at the meeting, are a clear and powerful response to the NATO summit. The Soviet Union believes that the five-nation foreign ministers' meeting has proven in the past few years to be an institution that obstructs rather than promotes the implementation of universal disarmament by the US-British bloc, and refuses to participate in such fruitless meetings. The Soviet Union reiterated its initiative to stop the arms race and implement peaceful coexistence, mainly: (1) The Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom should stop nuclear weapons testing from January 1, 1958; (2) The Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom should not use nuclear weapons; (3) The Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom should not deploy any kind of nuclear weapons in East Germany, West Germany, Poland, and Czechoslovakia; (4) All countries, especially the major powers, should greatly reduce the number of armed forces and armaments; (5) Participants in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and participants in the Warsaw Treaty should conclude a mutual non-aggression pact; (6) Force must not be used to solve the Middle East problem, and the independence of Middle East countries must not be undermined; (7) Heads of government of socialist and capitalist countries should hold a meeting, preceded by a meeting of representatives of the Soviet Union and the United States.
    As pointed out in the declaration of the Moscow meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries, "War or peaceful coexistence has become the fundamental issue of world politics." These initiatives of the Soviet government point the way to ending the Cold War, easing international tensions, stopping the arms race, and implementing peaceful coexistence. This is another constructive and major effort by the Soviet government to implement its consistent peaceful foreign policy, and it also expresses the spirit of the Moscow meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries and their sincere desire for world peace. Poland, the German Democratic Republic, and Czechoslovakia have expressed their support for the Soviet initiatives, especially the initiative to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. Our government has issued a statement fully supporting these important measures proposed by the Soviet government to safeguard world peace. The question now is whether the imperialist countries, headed by the United States, will recognize reality and accept the Soviet proposals, or whether they will stubbornly continue the "Cold War" policy and expand arms and prepare for war for the benefit of a small handful of monopoly capitalists?
    As long as people calmly study the Soviet Union's various peace proposals, they can clearly see that the Soviet Union has no intention of threatening others by relying on its military advantage of mastering the latest weapons. On the contrary, in view of the development of modern weapons which may bring unprecedented destruction to all mankind in a war, the Soviet Union strives to reach an agreement to ban the use of these weapons. The Soviet Union has no intention of invading others. On the contrary, it actively advocates peaceful coexistence. The sincere desire of the Soviet Union to seek world peace is so clear and firm that even influential people in the United States, such as former Ambassador to the Soviet Union Kennan and financial magnate Eaton, agree to negotiate with the Soviet Union. If the American ruling group really hopes for world peace, as Eisenhower said in his Christmas broadcast, then it should fully accept the Soviet proposals. As many Western newspapers and social celebrities have said, what is wrong with the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom agreeing to stop testing and ban the use of nuclear weapons? Especially at a time when the Soviet Union already has intercontinental missiles while the United States and the United Kingdom do not, is this not beneficial to the United States and the United Kingdom without any harm? What is wrong with establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe? Is this not also beneficial without any harm at a time when the United States and the United Kingdom do not even have medium-range missiles? What is wrong with all countries, especially the major powers, implementing universal disarmament? Has not the Western bloc headed by the United States already lagged far behind the Soviet Union in terms of armaments? Is not the implementation of universal disarmament beneficial to the United States and the United Kingdom without any harm? What is wrong with holding negotiations with the Soviet Union and socialist countries to achieve peaceful coexistence? Has not someone in the United States said that if a war breaks out now, the United States homeland will suffer? Many more questions of this kind can be raised. In short, if the American authorities are not planning for the high profits of a few monopoly groups who make fortunes through the arms race and war, if they are planning for the interests of the entire American people, including the interests of those entrepreneurs who advocate peaceful competition, what reason do they have not to accept the Soviet Union's peace proposals?
    However, after the NATO summit, the actions of the American authorities are contrary to peace. The powerful monopoly groups in the United States are stirring up a new frenzy of the arms race. At a meeting, US Vice President Nixon, using the pretext of new achievements in Soviet science and technology, clamored about the "Soviet threat" and demanded that the American people "tighten their belts," "make sacrifices," and "shed blood, sweat, and tears." US Senate Democratic leader Johnson demanded that the American people extend working hours and implement a "full wartime mobilization schedule" to manufacture missiles. Some even advocate "preemptive" war. Foster, the host of the notorious "Gaither Committee Report," is one such warmonger. The White House is busy drafting plans for arms expansion and planning to establish medium-range missile bases in Western Europe and the United States. It seems that the American ruling group is planning to accelerate the arms race, trying to catch up with the Soviet Union, restore its shattered "deterrent force," and prepare for a new war.
    What will the arms race ultimately bring to the United States? Will the American ruling group's wishful thinking come true?
    People may wish to review the experience since the end of World War II. In the past ten years or so, the United States has been pursuing a policy of arms expansion and war preparation aimed at dominating the world, spending huge sums of money on a frenzied arms race, organizing military blocs, and establishing military bases everywhere. On the one hand, American imperialism has done this in order to place more countries under its enslavement, and on the other hand, it has done this in order to launch a war of aggression against the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union when the time comes. But what was the result? Facts show that despite the great efforts the United States has spent on the arms race, it has not only failed to surpass the Soviet Union further, but even failed to maintain its advantage in armaments ten years ago. Not only has it long lost the atomic weapons advantage it once monopolized, but now it has fallen far behind the Soviet Union in terms of the latest modern weapons. The US medium-range missiles are stillborn, let alone intercontinental missiles. Western military experts have admitted that in the face of the latest weapons, US overseas bases and strategic air forces have lost their so-called "deterrent" effect. And in order to expand arms and prepare for war, the United States has spent more than 300 billion US dollars, and the total military expenditure of the NATO countries has increased more than twofold in the past eight or nine years. The huge military expenditure has brought serious adverse consequences to the national economies of the United States and its allies. The US government's debt is high, reaching an unprecedented record of 270 billion US dollars, prices are constantly rising, taxes are constantly increasing, and the lives of the broad masses of working people are becoming increasingly difficult. The only ones who have benefited from the arms expansion and war preparation are a small handful of monopoly capitalists who have obtained tens of billions of huge profits. Now, the United States is definitely behind the Soviet Union in terms of the latest weapons and the most important science and technology. The famous American physicist Taylor believes that the United States is ten years behind the Soviet Union, and some say it is five years behind. Whether it is ten years or five years, the question is whether the United States can change this backward state in five or ten years. This is not something that can be determined by subjective wishful thinking, but is determined by the issue of the social system. The superiority of socialism has enabled the Soviet Union to change from backward to advanced in the above aspects, and in the future, the Soviet Union will definitely and inevitably advance at a faster pace on the basis of its already advanced scientific and technological level and strong economic foundation. Even if the United States goes all out and may manufacture intercontinental missiles and launch artificial satellites, by that time, the Soviet Union will have greatly surpassed its current level and will have far surpassed the United States again. Even many Westerners see this as a foregone conclusion. French professor La Ville said: "Is it possible for the United States to change this backward state after all? This is extremely unlikely, because the scientific education that the Russians give their youth has always been much better than that of the Americans. The Soviet Union trains two or three times more engineers than the United States every year. Therefore, there is simply no reason to think that in the next ten years, the Russians will sleep soundly and not work hard to maintain their advanced position."
    To put it mildly, even if the United States catches up with the Soviet Union in terms of the latest armaments and the most important science and technology, what will happen? At that time, will the United States be able to win the war against the Soviet Union and socialist countries? History can answer this question correctly. We have always believed that the final result of war is determined by the nature of the war, by the direction of people's hearts, and that weapons cannot determine the final victory or defeat of war. No matter how new and large a number of weapons the United States has, it will never be able to win the war. However, Western strategists do not believe this. They believe more in their material things. They always like to boast about how many tons of steel the United States has, and believe that this is their greatest magic weapon for winning the victory of the war. Well, let's put aside the above and talk about whether steel plays a decisive role in the war. People remember that at the beginning of the establishment of the Soviet regime, the annual output of steel was only three million tons, but it was subjected to the armed intervention of the fourteen invading armies, which had far more military advantages, and there were also White bandits causing trouble internally. But what was the result? It was not the newly established and seemingly weak Soviet regime that failed, but the foreign interventionists. People also remember that during the Second World War, German fascism swept across the European continent, with a total annual steel output of 45 million tons, while the Soviet Union's annual steel output before the war was only 18 million tons. German fascism relied on this advantage and attempted to defeat the Soviet Union in one fell swoop. At that time, the United States and the United Kingdom, although possessing an annual steel output of 70 million tons, were constantly beaten by German fascism, suffering repeated defeats, and had to find the Soviet Union for help, first holding the Tehran Conference, and then holding the Yalta Conference, asking the Soviet Union to take the lead in the anti-fascist war. And after losing a large area of territory in the early stages of the war, the Soviet Union's annual steel output at that time was only about 9 million tons. However, the end of the war was still the victory of the Soviet Union. People also remember that after the Second World War, the socialist forces once carried out a large-scale contest with the imperialist forces. This was the Korean War. American imperialism personally came forward, carrying the banner of the "United Nations Army," and deploying millions of troops, not only with hundreds of millions of tons of steel as backing, but also with atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs. It was truly invincible. No wonder MacArthur had set the arrogant plan of occupying the entire North Korea within three weeks. However, after three years of competition, the American invading army retreated to the south of the 38th parallel and finally agreed to the armistice. The historical facts have proved that merely material advantages, the advantages of steel, and the advantages of armaments cannot guarantee the victory of the war. The victory or defeat of the war is determined by the nature of the war. Victory belongs to the just side, and victory belongs to the people. Therefore, the arms race is not a way out for the United States. If it insists on going its own way, then what awaits it will be as stated in the declaration of the Moscow meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries: "If the imperialist war maniacs insist on launching a war at all costs, then imperialism is doomed to perish, because the people will never continue to tolerate the system that brings them such heavy pain and sacrifice."
    Where is the way out? Only by recognizing reality, recognizing the reality of the coexistence of the socialist system and capitalism, and accepting peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition. Have not Dulles and his ilk been boasting about the "Western civilization" and the superiority of the capitalist system? Dulles recently said that the production level of the NATO countries per capita is much higher than that of the socialist countries, and he said that this is the capital for the West to fight against the socialist countries. Then, okay, if you really think that your capitalist system is superior to the socialist system, what dare you not abandon the "Cold War," dare you not stop the arms race, and engage in peaceful competition? The people of socialist countries believe that the socialist system is far superior to the capitalist system. We have no intention of aggression. What we are concerned about is engaging in peaceful labor, building our own country, and improving the material and cultural living standards of the people. The Soviet Union has announced that it is ready to catch up with and surpass the United States in the most important products within fifteen years. We Chinese people have also made up our minds to catch up with or surpass the United Kingdom in steel and other important industrial products in about fifteen years. Which social system is better? Let's compete in peace and see who is better. Is this not much better for the United States, the United Kingdom, and other Western countries than a hopeless arms race and war adventure?
    The matter could not be clearer. World history has developed to a new turning point, as Chairman Mao Zedong said, "The East wind prevails over the West wind." The peace-loving people of all countries are fighting for the cause of world peace with full confidence. The slogan of the forces for world peace is: We want peaceful coexistence, not an arms race! As Khrushchev said at the meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union: "We will do everything possible to make the coming year 1958 a year of peace, a year of decline or complete elimination of the 'Cold War,' so that people can live a life without worrying about their own fate, the fate of their children, wives, and mothers. Let the two systems compete on a peaceful basis, on the basis of economic and cultural upsurges and more fully meeting the material and spiritual needs of the people."
