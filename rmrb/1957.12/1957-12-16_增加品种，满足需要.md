Increase Variety, Meet Needs
By a People's Daily Commentator

The First Automobile Works, based on China's resource conditions, specific needs in various aspects, and the fact that China has only one major automobile factory, plans to produce more than a dozen new types of automobiles in the next five years. Starting next year, in addition to continuing to produce Liberation-brand vehicles, it will also produce gas-powered vehicles, three-axle off-road vehicles, dump trucks, and tractor-trailers. At the same time, it will design a small car. This approach of striving to increase variety and meet social needs as much as possible, based on possible conditions, is worthy of emulation by all factories with similar situations and conditions, especially newly built factories that have been put into production or are about to be.

During the period of the First Five-Year Plan for the development of China's national economy, we have established a preliminary foundation for socialist industrialization. China has built a series of new industrial sectors, China's industrial production capacity has greatly increased, China's industrial technical level has improved to a certain extent, China's original industrial base has been greatly strengthened, and new industrial bases are under construction. Because China's socialist material foundation is still very inadequate, we should recognize that this is a significant change in China's economic development, especially in industrial development. We should sufficiently estimate the great significance of this change in order to better utilize this preliminary foundation of industrialization that has been established to serve the upcoming Second Five-Year Plan for the development of China's national economy.

However, at present, some newly built, expanded, and rebuilt industrial enterprises, due to their single product (which is correct in the long run) coupled with insufficient raw material supply or limited sales channels, are unable to fully utilize their production capacity. This situation is most evident in the machinery manufacturing industry.

Of course, because China's economy is backward, everything is lacking, and all kinds of factories need to be built. However, precisely because China's economy is backward, when a large factory is built, if it does not diversify its products as much as possible according to China's resource conditions and the needs of various sectors, as well as the possibilities of the factory's production equipment, then either the raw material supply will be insufficient or sales problems will occur. Although this is only a temporary phenomenon, it is impossible to completely resolve it in a short period. Moreover, when old problems are solved, new problems will arise.

The solution to this problem, from the perspective of the enterprise itself, is to utilize domestic raw materials and materials as much as possible and, based on the possibilities of the factory's production equipment, increase the varieties urgently needed by society as much as possible to meet needs. Doing so can gradually alleviate the contradiction of insufficient raw material supply, open up new sales channels, meet social needs in many ways, and at the same time improve technical levels and maximize the factory's production capacity. Not only has the experience of the First Automobile Works proven this point, but the experience of the Anshan Seamless Steel Tube Plant has also proven this point. The Anshan Seamless Steel Tube Plant originally had fewer product varieties, and the produced pipes could not be sold, while the pipes urgently needed by society were very scarce. Later, by increasing the variety, it not only met the needs of society more, but also increased the factory's production capacity from the original designed capacity of 60,000 tons per year to 100,000 tons per year. The experience of the First Automobile Works and the Anshan Seamless Steel Tube Plant should be learned not only by newly built, expanded, and rebuilt factories, but also by old factories. Because both of these factories are newly built large enterprises, and according to their original designs, they are all large-scale production with relatively single products. However, they can still greatly increase new varieties. Therefore, it is even easier for some old factories, many of which originally had diversified products, but later inappropriately emphasized specialization, thus reducing the variety, to increase the new varieties urgently needed by society as much as possible now.

Some people say: having many product varieties in a factory hinders the specialization of the factory's production and hinders the full utilization of production capacity. This argument only has one aspect of the truth and lacks comprehensive reasoning. Under certain conditions, that is, under the conditions where the supply of raw materials and product sales are guaranteed, it is of course beneficial for a factory to have fewer product varieties and more specialized production. The problem is: if our raw material production is not enough, the supply of raw materials is difficult, product sales are limited, and society needs a wide variety of products, then in this case, producing a single product is not as beneficial as producing a variety of products rationally. Otherwise, the limited raw materials will be made into unsalable products. This will not only make the supply of raw materials even tighter, but also the production capacity cannot be truly fully utilized. The experience of the First Automobile Works and the Anshan Seamless Steel Tube Plant proves that after they increased the variety of products, they not only did not waste production capacity, but also greatly improved production capacity.

It should also be pointed out that when increasing new varieties, not only should attention be paid to the fact that the products themselves of these new varieties use domestic raw materials as much as possible, but also attention should be paid to the fact that when these products are delivered to users, they can also utilize domestic, especially local, resources as much as possible. The First Automobile Works paid special attention to increasing gas-powered vehicles among the new products, which is a very good example. When manufacturing automobiles, this factory made great efforts to modify product designs in order to utilize domestic steel as much as possible. At the same time, they saw that China currently lacks gasoline resources, while gas resources are relatively abundant, so they produce automobiles that can use bituminous coal, anthracite coal, charcoal, coke, and even natural gas as power. This not only solves the difficulty of insufficient raw material supply in the production process, but also solves the difficulty of insufficient raw materials in the product use process, thus opening up product sales and improving production capacity. This is one of the vivid examples of implementing the Party Central Committee's proposal to build socialism in a way that is more, faster, better, and more economical in production. This spirit is worth learning by all factories with similar situations and conditions.

The important issue is that when factories increase new varieties, they must proceed from the needs of society and the specific conditions of the factory. It is wrong to subjectively increase new varieties away from social needs. It is also wrong to increase new varieties without considering the specific conditions of the factory, that is, without fully utilizing the factory's existing production equipment and technical strength, or abandoning some equipment, or requiring expansion of factory buildings, adding new equipment, and increasing new technical workers. As for carrying out necessary technical and organizational measures, such as rationally adjusting production lines, adjusting labor organization, and adding some tools, instruments, and individual machines, in order to use domestic or local raw materials to increase new varieties, that is of course necessary and correct.

　　增加品种，满足需要
　　本报评论员
    第一汽车制造厂根据我国的资源条件和各方面的具体需要，以及我国还只有一个大汽车工厂的情况，计划在今后五年内生产十几种新型的汽车，并且从明年起，除了继续生产解放牌的汽车以外，就要生产煤气汽车、三轴越野汽车、翻斗车和牵引车，同时，还要设计出一种小轿车。这种根据可能的条件，努力增加品种、尽量满足社会需要的做法，值得所有具有同样情况和条件的工厂，特别是已经投入或者即将投入生产的新建的工厂效法。
    在发展我国国民经济的第一个五年计划期间，我们已经建立起社会主义工业化的初步基础。我国已经建设起一系列的新的工业部门，我国的工业生产能力已有很大的增长，我国工业的技术水平有了一定的提高，我国原有的工业基地，已经大为加强，新的工业基地正在建设中。由于我国社会主义的物质基础还很不充分，所以我们更应该认识这是我国经济发展中特别是工业发展中的重大的变化，我们应当足够地估计这种变化的重大意义，以便更好地利用这个已经建立起来的工业化的初步基础，为即将到来的发展我国国民经济的第二个五年计划服务。
    但是，目前有些新建、扩建、改建的工业企业，由于它的产品单一（这从长远说来，有些是对的）加上原材料供应不足或者销路有限，以致它们的生产能力不能充分发挥。这种情形，在机械制造工业方面表现得最为明显。
    当然，由于我国经济落后，什么都缺，什么样的工厂都需要建设。但是，正因为我国经济落后，所以，当一个大型的工厂建设起来之后，如果不根据我国的资源条件和各方面的需要，以及工厂生产设备的可能性，尽可能地使产品多样化，那么，不是原料供应不足，就是销路发生问题。这虽然只是暂时的现象，但是，也不可能在很短的期间完全解决。而且旧的问题解决了，新的问题还将发生。
    解决这个问题的办法，就企业本身来说，就是尽量利用本国的原料和材料，根据工厂生产设备的可能，尽可能地增加社会急需的品种，以满足需要。这样做，可以逐步地缓和原材料供应不足的矛盾，可以开辟新的销路，多方面地满足社会需要，同时还可以提高技术水平，尽量发挥工厂的生产能力。不仅第一汽车制造厂的经验证明了这一点，而且鞍山的无缝钢管厂的经验也证明了这一点。鞍山的无缝钢管厂，原来产品品种较少，生产的管子销不出去，而社会上急需的管子，又很缺乏，后来增加了品种，不仅更多地满足了社会上的需要，而且这个工厂的生产能力，也由原设计能力的年产六万吨，增加到年产十万吨。第一汽车制造厂和鞍山无缝钢管厂的经验，不仅新建的扩建的和改建的工厂应当学习，就是老的工厂也应当学习。因为这两个工厂都是新建的大企业，按照它们原来的设计，都是大规模生产的，产品也是比较单一的。但是，它们还可能大量地增加新的品种。那么，一些老的工厂，有许多原来就是产品多样化的，后来有的不适当地强调了专一化，因而把品种减少了，现在要它们尽可能地增加社会急需的新品种，就更加容易了。
    有人说：工厂产品品种多，妨碍工厂生产的专业化，妨碍生产能力的充分利用。这种论点，只有一方面的道理，缺乏全面的道理。在一定的条件之下，即在原材料供应和产品销路都有保证的条件之下，工厂产品的品种少一些，生产专业化一些，当然是有好处的。问题是：如果我们的原材料生产还不够，原材料供应有困难，产品销路有限，而社会上又需要多种多样的产品，在这种情况下，生产单一的产品，就不如合理地生产多样的产品更为有利了。否则，将会把有限的原材料，制做成滞销的产品。这样，不仅使原材料的供应更加紧张，而且生产能力也不能真正充分地利用。第一汽车制造厂和鞍山无缝钢管厂的经验证明：他们在增加了产品的品种之后，不仅没有浪费生产能力，而且大大地提高了生产能力。
    还应当指出：在增加新品种的时候，不但要注意这些新品种的产品本身尽可能地使用本国的原材料，而且还要注意这种产品在交付用户使用的时候，也能够尽可能地利用本国的尤其是当地的资源。第一汽车制造厂在增加的新产品中，特别注意了增加煤气汽车，就是很好的例子。这个工厂在制造汽车的时候，为了尽量利用国产钢材，曾经用了很大努力修改了产品设计。同时，它们看到我国目前汽油资源缺乏，而煤气资源比较丰富，因而生产可以用烟煤、无烟煤、木炭、焦炭以至天然煤气作动力的汽车。这样，就不仅解决了生产过程中原材料供应不足的困难，而且也解决了产品使用过程中原料不足的困难，因而打开产品销路，提高生产能力。这是在生产方面，贯彻执行党中央所提出又多又快又好又省地建设社会主义的生动事例之一。这种精神，是值得所有具有同样情况和条件的工厂学习的。
    重要的问题是工厂在增加新品种的时候，必须要从社会需要和本厂的具体情况出发。离开社会需要而主观地增加新品种，那是不对的。不根据本厂的具体情况，也就是说，不充分利用工厂现有的生产设备和技术力量，或者废弃一部分设备，或者要求扩建厂房，增添新的设备，增加新的技术工人来增加新品种，那也是不对的。至于为了使用本国或者本地的原材料，增加新的品种，而进行必要的技术组织措施，如合理地调整生产线，调整劳动组织，以及补添某些工具、仪器和个别的机器，那当然是必要的和正确的。
