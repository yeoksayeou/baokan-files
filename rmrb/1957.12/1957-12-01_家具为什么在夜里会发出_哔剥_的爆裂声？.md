Why does furniture make "crackling" noises at night?

Furniture made of wood or other materials generally expands when heated and contracts when cooled. Because the temperature is lower at night than during the day, the furniture will contract. At the same time, when the air is hot, it contains more moisture. When it cools down at night, it deposits the moisture onto objects, and the molecules inside the objects adjust accordingly. The contraction and adjustment of the objects produces the "crackling" sound. It is easier to hear this sound clearly at night because it is quieter.

　  家具为什么在夜里会发出“哔剥”的爆裂声？
    木制或其他原料作的家具，一般都是遇热膨胀，遇冷收缩。因为夜里的气温比白天低，家具就要收缩。同时空气热的时候，包含的湿气较多，到晚上冷却时，就把湿气积放到物体上去，物体内部的分子因此也随着调整。物体的收缩与调整，就发出了“哔剥”的声音。夜里比较安静，所以容易清楚地听到这种声音。
