Xinhua News Agency, December 1st. The Polish Warsaw Acrobatic Troupe gave its first performance in China tonight at the Tianqiao Theater in Beijing, and was warmly welcomed by more than 1,500 spectators. The acrobatic troupe performed fourteen wonderful programs in more than two hours.

Vice Premier Chen Yi, Minister of Culture Shen Yanbing, Minister of Higher Education Yang Xiufeng, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, Vice Minister of Culture Liu Zhiming, and President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Chu Tunan and others watched tonight's performance.

Also watching tonight's performance were the Polish Ambassador to China, Kirilo, and the Polish cultural delegation headed by the Polish Minister of Higher Education, Żukrowski.

The acrobatic troupe began their performance tonight with a beautiful Polish folk music prelude. The first program was "Gladiators," which won a silver medal at this year's World Youth and Student Peace and Friendship Festival. The four-person group of W. Gaiderois, with their sturdy muscles, performed the beauty of human body modeling with various movements similar to "human pyramids."

The "Vehicle Skills" performed by the two-person group of Yang Kor has a different style from China's "Vehicle Skills." The performers pedaled the vehicle while freeing their hands or one foot to perform other programs. The most difficult of these was pedaling a bicycle while using their feet to pick up twelve plastic plates, a cup, and a spoon one by one on their heads.

During the intermission, Vice Premier Chen Yi met with the leader of the acrobatic troupe, P. Roschischewski, and other leaders, as well as the main actor of "Gladiators," W. Gaiderois.

After the performance, Vice Premier Chen Yi and others went to the stage to shake hands with the acrobatic troupe members to express their congratulations.

　　波兰华沙杂技团在北京首次演出
    据新华社1日讯　波兰华沙杂技团今晚在北京天桥剧场举行访华首次演出，受到了一千五百多名观众的热烈欢迎。杂技团在两个多小时内，共演出十四个精采的节目。
    陈毅副总理，文化部部长沈雁冰，高等教育部部长杨秀峰，外交部副部长章汉夫，文化部副部长刘芝明和对外文化协会会长楚图南等观看了今晚的演出。
    观看今晚演出的还有波兰驻中国大使基里洛克和以波兰高等教育部部长茹凯夫斯基为首的波兰文化代表团。
    杂技团今晚以优美的波兰民间音乐为前奏，开始他们的演出。第一个节目是曾经在今年世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节上获得银质奖章的“角斗士”。有着结实肌肉的瓦·盖德罗伊士四人小组，以类似“叠罗汉”的各种动作，表演了人体造型的美。
    杨·科尔二人小组表演的“车上手技”，同我国的“车技”有着不同的风格。演员一面用脚蹬车，一面腾出双手或一只脚表演其他节目。其中最困难的是一面蹬自行车，一面用脚把十二个胶质盘子、一只杯子和一只羹匙一个个地挑在头顶上。
    在演出休息时，陈毅副总理接见了杂技团团长包·罗斯齐谢夫斯基等领导人员和“角斗士”主要演员瓦·盖德罗伊士。
    在演出结束后，陈毅副总理等还到舞台上同杂技团演员们握手，表示祝贺。
