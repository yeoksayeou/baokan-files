Red Blossoms Welcome the New Year
By Our Reporter Wen Tianshen

On the eve of the New Year, I visited the No. 2 Machining Workshop of the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory. This is a workshop that is working on the 1958 plan, twenty-five days ahead of schedule. In the workshop, more than forty machine tools are adorned with festive big red flowers.

In front of a radial drilling machine adorned with red flowers, fitter Liu Zhenkuan is already working on the March 1959 plan. He and his fellow fitters Lan Yongfu, Han Jikui, and others, guarantee that they will each work fourteen hours every workday in the coming year and save 240 yuan each in cutting tool consumables.

Next to a planer adorned with red flowers, people introduced me to veteran worker Qi Shichun. Recently, when machining machine beds, he exceeded his quota by 25%. He quickly taught his method of exceeding the quota to others, enabling the entire group to exceed the quota by about 20%.

These days, in this workshop, the most desirable thing is to have one's machine tool adorned with red flowers to welcome the New Year. Turner Wang Wenlong has not produced a single defective product for twenty-two consecutive months. Recently, he and his group developed a method of using water instead of oil to cool the cutting tools, saving 100 kilograms of oil. As a result, the whole group won a second red flower before the end of the year.

Amid the sound of metal cutting, section chief Duan Wenhui pointed to another turner, Guo Yuquan, and said, "This person, who could never reach the quota before, can now exceed the quota." It seems that the section chief is particularly concerned and interested in him. Originally, when the section chief gave him tasks, he would often pester him, saying, "Why are you giving me this job? What if I can't reach the quota?" But recently, when he was given a new task, unexpectedly, he improved a fixture that day, increasing efficiency by 50%. The section chief said, "Now he smiles at me and says: I couldn't reach the quota in the past because I was afraid of difficulties. The worse my mood, the less likely I was to reach the quota. Now that my mood is high, I also have ideas."

An Zhiyou's machine tool, which was once known as the "king of defective products," has recently been adorned with red flowers. This young man's change began with the workshop's big debate and detailed accounting. Comrades helped him realize that although he only wasted a few minutes by making a defective product, the wasted time added up across many processes, such as turning, milling, and planing. He thought: the country requires us to catch up with Britain's industrial level in fifteen years. How could I make defective products and waste steel!

On the eve of the New Year, in Shenyang, this industrial city, I only visited one workshop out of hundreds of factories. But the workers' enthusiasm to strive to over fulfill their tasks and produce machines ahead of schedule makes me feel the pulse of our great motherland beating every minute.

### 红花朵朵迎新年

    红花朵朵迎新年
    本报记者　文天申
    在新年前夕，记者访问了沈阳第三机床厂二号加工车间。这是一个提前二十五天干着1958年活的车间。车间里，有四十多台机床都挂着喜气洋洋的大红花。
    在一台挂着红花的摇臂钻床前，钳工刘振宽已在干着1959年3月份的活。他和同组的钳工蓝永福、韩吉奎等，保证要在明年每个工作日中干出十四小时的活，在刀具消耗用品上，做到每人节约二百四十元。
    在一台挂着红花的刨床旁，人们给我介绍了老师傅祁士春。最近他在加工床身时，超过定额25％。他很快地把自己突破定额的方法教给了别人，使全小组都突破定额20％左右。
    这几天，在这个车间里，最令人向往的事就是让自己的机床戴上红花迎接新年。车工王文龙已经连续二十二个月没出废品了，最近他和他的小组研究出一种以水代油来冷却刀具的办法，节约了一百公斤油，全组因此在年底前又赢得了第二朵红花。
    在一片金属切削声中，工段长段文会指着另一个车工郭玉全说：“这个一直达不到定额的人，现在也能突破定额了。”看来工段长对他特别关心和感兴趣。原来，过去工段长给他任务时，他经常缠着说：“这活为啥给我干？定额达不到怎么办？”可是最近又给他一件新任务时，出乎意外地，他当天就改进了一种活具，效率提高了50％。工段长说：“现在他碰到我就笑着说：过去达不到定额，是怕困难。情绪越不好，越达不到定额。现在情绪高了，办法也有了。”
    过去曾经被称为废品大王的安志有的机床，最近也被戴上了红花。这个小伙子的变化是从车间大辩论、算细账那时候开始的。同志们帮助他认识到：自己做废一个活虽然只糟踏了几分钟；可是上面车、铣、刨等许多工序加起来，糟踏的就多了。他想：国家要求十五年赶上英国的工业水平，自己做出废品，浪费了钢铁，是多么不应该！
    新年前夕，记者在沈阳这个工业城市里，虽然只访问了数百个工厂中的一个车间，但是工人们力争超额完成任务、提前出产机器的劲头，每一分钟都使我感到伟大祖国的脉搏在跳动。
