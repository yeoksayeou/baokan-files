Villages and Communes Run People's Schools: Boys and Girls All Go to School

    Xiufeng Township in Gutian County, Fujian Province, is a remote mountainous area with scattered villages and obstructed transportation. In the old society, farmers suffered from hunger and cold, and had no opportunity to attend school; more than 98% were illiterate. After liberation, with the development of agricultural cooperation, the literacy campaign gradually formed a high tide. Now 96% of the young and middle-aged people in the township are participating in learning, showing a new atmosphere of "villages and communes running people's schools, boys and girls all going to school."

    By the autumn of this year, the township had eliminated illiteracy among more than 400 young and middle-aged people (accounting for 80% of the total number of young and middle-aged illiterates), and all 298 young illiterates had reached the literacy standard, shaking off the state of illiteracy. These people were originally uneducated "roughnecks." After studying at people's schools and completing three "Farmer Literacy Textbooks," they can now recognize more than 1,500 characters, read popular books and newspapers, and write simple notes and letters. Many of them have become activists in various movements due to the improvement of their political awareness and cultural level; some have become people's school tutors, work point recorders, accountants, and technicians in agricultural cooperatives; and some have been promoted to the higher primary classes of people's schools to continue their studies.

    Xiufeng Township has transformed from a culturally backward mountain township into the first cultural township in the province, winning the honorary title of provincial advanced literacy unit, and also received commendation and awards from the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League.

    村村社社办民校　男男女女齐上学
    福建省古田县秀峰乡，是一个村庄分散、交通阻塞的偏僻山乡。在旧社会里，农民饥寒交迫，没有上学机会，98％以上是文盲。解放后，随着农业合作化的发展，扫盲运动日益形成高潮。现在全乡96％的青壮年都参加学习，出现“村村社社办民校，男男女女齐上学”的新气象。
    到今年秋前为止，这个乡已扫除青壮年文盲四百多人（占青壮年文盲总数80％），青年文盲二百九十八人全部达到扫盲标准，摆脱了文盲状态。这些人原来都是不识字的“大老粗”，经过民校学习，读完三本“农民识字课本”，现在已认得一千五百多字，会看通俗书报，会写简单便条和书信。其中许多人由于政治觉悟、文化水平的提高，成为各项运动中的积极分子；有的当了民校辅导员，农业社的记工员、会计员和技术员；有的升入民校高小班，继续学习。
    秀峰乡从一个文化落后的山乡变成全省第一个文化乡，获得省扫盲先进单位的光荣称号，还受到共青团中央的表扬奖励。
