Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, December 23rd (Xinhua News Agency reporters Li Shao Yi and Fan Suí report): The Baoji-Chengdu Railway has been signed off on after inspection and will soon be officially handed over to the state for use.

Why hasn't the Baoji-Chengdu Railway officially opened to traffic yet since the north and south sections were connected in July of last year? Regarding this question that the people of the whole country are concerned about, the reporters interviewed the responsible person from the relevant departments in charge of building this railway.

The responsible person said that the Baoji-Chengdu Railway crosses the three provinces of Sichuan, Gansu, and Shaanxi. This railway is one of the main transportation arteries connecting Southwest and Northwest China; it is also a major artery connecting the Southwest region to the heart of the motherland—Beijing—and the entire country. Its completion plays a significant role in China's socialist construction. Therefore, the people of the whole country's earnest concern for this railway and their desire for the entire line to officially open for business as soon as possible is understandable. However, according to the normal stages of railway construction and use, track connection does not equate to official opening for business. The responsible person then introduced the Soviet Union's experience in railway construction. In the Soviet Union, the period from track connection to official handover to the state for use is divided into three stages: passage of engineering trains, commencement of temporary transportation, and official handover to the state for operation. This approach allows for the maximum utilization of the railway under construction for transporting materials, thereby reducing construction costs. At the same time, it allows for phased investments based on urgency, ensuring that state funds are used in the most rational and beneficial way and at the most opportune time. The construction of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway has precisely drawn on this valuable Soviet experience and responded to the Party and government's call for increasing production and practicing economy and reducing construction costs by adopting a phased approach to using funds and utilizing completed sections of the railway to transport construction materials or conduct temporary transportation operations. For example, the Chengdu-Guangyuan section, which started construction earliest, saved more than 2 million yuan in costs compared to the original budget for truck transportation by using the newly built railway to transport construction materials in the year following the completion of track laying in 1954. Looking at the entire line, the Chengdu-Mianyang section and the Mianyang-Shangxiba section were officially handed over to the state for operation as early as 1954 and 1955, respectively. Other sections also successively commenced engineering train transportation or temporary passenger and freight transportation as the track-laying progressed. On April 1st of this year, direct temporary passenger and freight transportation was implemented from Chengdu to Baoji, and on November 1st, it was extended from Baoji to Xi'an. According to statistics, in the past four years or so, the entire line has transported more than 3 million passenger trips and more than 4 million tons of cargo (including segmented transportation in previous years). These facts fully demonstrate that the Baoji-Chengdu Railway has already played a transportation role both before and after track connection.

The responsible person said that the only remaining issue is the section of track from Shangxiba to Baoji. Why wasn't this section handed over to the state for official operation immediately after track connection, like the Chengdu-Mianyang and Mianyang-Shangxiba sections, but rather postponed until January 1958? The responsible person said that the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is the first challenging and complex mountain railway built in China. The terrain, geology, and hydrogeology along the line, especially the section from Shangxiba to Baoji, are extremely complex. This section is mostly mountainous, with towering peaks, crisscrossing river valleys, and steep natural slopes, featuring many precipitous cliffs. At the same time, the line passes through seismic zones and areas prone to landslides, with extremely serious geological hazards, including faults, landslides, karst caves, collapses, groundwater, and debris flows. The variety and severity of adverse geological conditions along the Baoji-Chengdu Railway are rare in railway history both domestically and internationally. Soviet design expert Baskukin aptly compared the geological conditions along the Baoji-Chengdu Railway to "a complete museum of engineering geology science." Furthermore, due to a lack of experience, insufficient technical capabilities and understanding of the geological conditions, as well as some design and construction inadequacies, a total of 2,136 large and small geological hazards were successively discovered along the entire line after construction entered the mountainous areas in 1954, especially after the rainy seasons of 1955 and 1956.

The responsible person continued, the reason why the Shangxiba to Baoji section could not be quickly handed over to the state for use is precisely due to the aforementioned large number of serious hazards that needed to be rectified. The construction of hazard rectification and train operation interfere with each other; the more trains that run, the slower the hazard rectification will be, which will further prolong the construction time and postpone the date of official handover to the state for operation. At the same time, due to the high probability of landslides and road closures along the line, train operation is intermittent, and the station and track facilities have not been fully constructed and installed to the required extent after track connection. Therefore, it is more reasonable to slightly delay the official handover to the state. However, even under such a heavy task of hazard rectification, the greatest efforts were made to provide temporary operation using small-scale transportation methods to transport some urgently needed materials for the local area without affecting construction. Overall, the commencement of external transportation on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway cannot be considered late.

People may ask: Since geological hazards occurred on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway so early, why weren't the hazards rectified before track connection? Why was there such a rush to connect the entire line during the rainy season of 1956? In response to this question, the responsible person replied that from the perspective of railway construction, track connection is only a step in the construction process of a new railway. It is to create more favorable conditions for subsequent projects and is a means to serve construction. There are only benefits and no drawbacks to doing so. Track connection is not our ultimate goal. Our ultimate goal is to hand over to the state a railway with good quality and complete equipment for transportation operations. Moreover, the rainy season of 1956 came particularly early, starting with heavy rain on June 5th, which was unexpected. The rainfall was heavy and lasted for a long time, not only causing the Baoji-Chengdu Railway to suffer from landslides and road closures due to serious geological hazards, but also causing long-term traffic disruptions on the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway at that time. The various transportation access roads to our construction sites suffered the same fate and could not be opened for a long time, but the remaining work had to continue, and hazard rectification should not be stopped. At that time, the construction site was located in the Shaanxi-Gansu border area, and the supply of materials and provisions was difficult. In order to transport a large amount of materials to the construction site to maintain the continued progress of the project, the only way was to try our best to connect the entire line so that the north and south ends could support each other. Therefore, the measure of seizing the opportunity to connect the entire line was necessary, timely, and correct.

The responsible person finally said that the construction of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway was indeed arduous and complex, and the geological hazards that occurred along the line were also serious. However, thanks to the leadership of the Party and the government, the support of the people of the whole country, and the help of Soviet experts, all the staff of the Ministry of Railways and the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, with a spirit of being responsible to the state and the people, concentrated most of their efforts in the year or so before and after track connection, fought tenaciously against dangerous mountains and treacherous waters, and finally basically completed the rectification of the serious geological hazards that were rare in the history of Chinese railways, thereby creating the conditions for the official handover of the entire line to the state for use.

In early 1957, the results of the inspection of the track quality using a railcar showed that the entire section scored 1,400 points, which was failing. After the hard work of the track staff and strengthened maintenance, the re-inspection in September 1957 showed that the entire section scored 179.5 points, reaching above the qualified level; the entire line had eight excellent work zones, seven good work zones, and the number of unqualified work zones was reduced to six.

The responsible person said that in the process of building this challenging and complex mountain railway, we made some mistakes and shortcomings, but also learned many experiences and lessons. These rich experiences and lessons will be of great significance to China's future construction of mountain railways.

    宝成路为什么到现在还没有正式通车？
    筑路有关部门负责人答新华社记者问
    新华社成都23日电　新华社记者李绍伊、范眭报道：宝成铁路已经签字验收，很快就要交付国家正式使用了。
    宝成铁路为什么在去年7月南北接轨以后迄今还没有正式通车呢？记者就这个全国人民所关心的问题，访问了修建这条铁路的有关部门的负责人。
    负责人说，宝成铁路横跨川、甘、陕三省。这条铁路是联接我国西南和西北的主要交通干线之一；又是西南地区通向祖国心脏——北京和全国的大动脉，它的建成，对我国社会主义建设起着很大作用。因此，全国人民对这条铁路的殷切关怀，渴望全线及早正式营业的心情是可以理解的。但是，按照铁路修建和使用的正常阶段，接轨并不等于正式通车营业。负责人接着介绍了苏联修建铁路的经验。在苏联，铁路从接轨到正式交付国家使用，共分为通行工程列车、开办临时运输和正式交付国家营业三个阶段。这样作，可以尽量利用修建中的铁路来运输器材，以降低造价，同时又可以分别缓急分期投资，使国家资金用到最合理、最有利的方面和时间上。宝成铁路的修建正是吸取了苏联这一宝贵经验，响应了党和政府关于增产节约、降低造价的号召，采取分期使用资金、分段利用已成铁路来运输工程材料或兼办临时运输营业。例如开工最早的成（都）广（元）段，1954年提前完成铺轨工程以后的下一个年度里，利用新建成的铁路运输工程材料，其成本就比原预算的汽车运输费用节省二百多万元。再从全线来看，成（都）绵（阳）段和绵（阳）上（西坝）段，早在1954年和1955年就分别正式交付国家营业。其它各段也随着铺轨进度相继地开办了工程列车运输或临时客货运输。今年4月1日，从成都到宝鸡办理了直达的临时客货运输，11月1日又由宝鸡延长到西安。据统计，在最近四年多里，全线运输（包括各段的历年分段运输）旅客三百多万人次，运输货物四百多万吨。这些事实都充分说明了宝成铁路在接轨前后已经发挥了一部分运输作用。
    负责人说，现在的问题仅在于上西坝到宝鸡的一段线路。为什么这段线路不是如同成绵、绵上两段一样，在接轨以后就交付国家正式营业，而要推迟到1958年1月才能交付使用。负责人说，宝成铁路是我国修建的第一条艰巨复杂的山区铁路，沿线特别是上西坝到宝鸡这一段的地形地质和水文地质情况极其复杂。这一段绝大部分是山岳地区，崇山峻岭，河谷纵横，天然坡度陡峭，有许多悬崖绝壁。同时，沿线经过地震区和坍方地带，地质病害现象十分严重，有断层、滑坡、溶洞、崩坍、地下水和流石流泥等。宝成铁路不良地质的多种多样和严重程度，在国内外的铁路史上都是少有的。苏联设计专家巴斯库金曾恰当地把宝成铁路沿线的地质情况比喻成“一个完整的工程地质科学博物馆”。同时由于缺乏经验，当时的技术力量和水平以及对于地质情况的认识和掌握都不够，再加以某些设计和施工的不当，因此自1954年施工进入山区，特别是在1955年和1956年雨季以后，全线陆续发现大小病害二千一百三十六处。
    负责人接着说，上西坝到宝鸡段之所以没能很快地交付国家使用，正是由于上述的大量的严重病害需要整治。整治病害的施工与行车互有干扰，行车愈多，整治病害就愈慢，这样就会更加延长施工时间和推迟正式交付国家营业的日期。同时，由于沿线坍方断道的可能性大，行车时断时续，接轨以后站场行车设备也未建筑安装齐全到应有的程度，因此还是稍缓移交国家正式营业较为合理。但是就在整治病害这样繁重的任务下，在不影响施工的同时，还是尽了最大的努力以临时营业小量运输的方法，为地方运输了部分迫切需要的物资。总的说来，宝成路开办对外运输并不能算迟的。
    人们也许要问：既然宝成铁路病害发生很早，为什么不把病害治好了再接轨呢？为什么在1956年雨季急于全线接轨呢？对这个问题，负责人回答说，从铁路施工来说，接轨只是新建铁路施工过程中的一道工序，它是为以后工程创造更有利的条件，是为施工服务的一种手段，这样作是有百利而无一害的。接轨不是我们的最终目的。我们的最终目的，是交给国家一条质量良好、设备齐全的铁路来办运输。何况1956年雨季比常年来得特别早，6月5日就开始下大雨，这是我们初料所不及的。那时雨量大，延续时间长，不仅宝成铁路由于病害严重而坍方断道，川陕公路当时也发生长期行车中断的现象。我们修到工地的各种运输便道也遭受到同样的命运，长久不能通车，但是余工必须进行，病害更不宜停止医治。当时工地处于陕甘边区，材料给养均感困难。为了运送大量的材料到工地，以维持工程的继续推进，只有尽最大努力接通全线，以使南北两端互相支援。因此，抓紧全线接轨的措施是必要的、适时的和正确的。
    负责人最后说，宝成铁路的工程确实是艰巨、复杂的，沿线发生过的病害也是严重的。但是，由于有党和政府的领导，全国人民的支持和苏联专家的帮助，铁道部和宝成铁路的全体职工以对国家、对人民负责到底的精神，在接轨前后一年多的时间里，集中了绝大部分的力量，顽强地同险山恶水作斗争，终于把我国铁路史上罕有的严重病害基本上整治完竣，从而创造了全线正式交付国家使用的条件。
    1957年初，用轨道车检查线路质量结果，全段评分为一千四百分，不及格。经过线路职工辛勤的劳动，加强维修，到1957年9月份再次检查，全段评分为一百七十九点五分，达到合格以上；全线有八个优良工区，七个良好工区，不合格工区减为六个。
    负责人说，我们在建设这条艰巨复杂的山区铁路的过程中，出现了一些错误和缺点，也吸取了不少的经验教训。这些丰富的经验教训，对我国今后修筑山区铁路将有很大的意义。
