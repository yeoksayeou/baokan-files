    Who Should Be Interrogated
    Italian Undersecretary of Justice Scelba recently said that Italian Communist Party Deputy General Secretary Longo and PCI member of parliament Audisio will be interrogated regarding the events surrounding the execution of former Italian fascist leader Mussolini in 1945. It is said that this is due to accusations that Longo and Audisio were the masterminds and executioners of Mussolini's execution.
    Everyone knows that Mussolini's fascist rule caused the Italian people endless sacrifices and immense disasters. Although this fascist ringleader was executed by the angry people of Milan more than ten years ago, the disasters he left behind in Italy have not yet been completely eliminated. One must ask: in the Italian court, who should be interrogated? The Italian patriotic men of action who executed Mussolini, or the descendants of Mussolini who are trying to revive fascism in Italy?

    谁该受到审讯
    意大利司法次长斯卡耳法罗最近说，意大利共产党副总书记隆哥和意共议员奥迪西欧将被作审讯对象，以讯问1945年处决前意大利法西斯魁首墨索里尼前后的事态发展。据说，这是由于有人控告隆哥和奥迪西欧是处决墨索里尼的主使人和执刑人。
    谁都知道，墨索里尼的法西斯统治曾使意大利人民遭受到无穷的牺牲和极大的灾害。虽然，这个法西斯罪魁被愤怒的米兰人民处死已经十多年了，可是他给意大利所留下的灾害至今还未完全消除。人们要问：在意大利的法庭上究竟是谁该受到审讯呢？是那些处决了墨索里尼的意大利的爱国志士，还是那些力图使法西斯在意大利复活的墨索里尼的子孙们？
