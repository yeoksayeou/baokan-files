Xinhua News Agency, December 25th: The headquarters of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League (TDSL) convened representatives from various local organizations and league members in Beijing from November 10th to December 8th for multiple meetings to expose and criticize the anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes of Xie Xuehong, chairman of the TDSL and a rightist. According to revelations at the meetings, Xie Xuehong was an extremely arrogant personal ambitionist.

Xie Xuehong infiltrated the Communist Party in 1947. For ten years, she styled herself as a "veteran revolutionary" and a "February 28th heroine," looking down on everyone and acting like a dictator. The Communist Party had long educated her and patiently waited for her to repent. However, Xie Xuehong consistently resisted the Party's education, and this time, she took advantage of the Party's rectification movement to launch many poisonous arrows and attack the Party.

During the period of extensive airing of views, Xie Xuehong used various methods to stir up trouble. Behind the scenes, she instigated TDSL cadres and rightist elements such as Shen Yi to attack the Party's cadre policy as being sectarian and to slander Communist Party members as being "lawless and tyrannical"; she attacked the united front policy as being "better left than right" and "biased and credulous." Xie Xuehong also incited Gaoshan ethnic cadres to attack progressive people in the TDSL, saying: You Gaoshan people should get more people involved and not let this opportunity pass, give them (referring to progressive people) a hard time. She also shamelessly said: "Only I truly care about the Gaoshan people." Xie also colluded with TDSL members and rightist elements such as Jiang Wenye to provoke discord between the Communist Party and overseas Chinese, and they touted Xie, saying: "There is Liao Wenyi in Tokyo, Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan, and Chairman Xie on the mainland." Xie Xuehong also incited TDSL cadres to use methods such as writing big-character posters in an attempt to drive away Communist Party members in the TDSL. Xie Xuehong not only stirred up trouble in Beijing, but also went to Tianjin and Guangzhou to incite rightist elements to attack the Party.

Xie Xuehong also actively obstructed and undermined the anti-rightist struggle. When the National People's Congress convened this year, one delegate asked Xie to expose Zhang Bojun together, but Xie said: "Don't kick a man when he's down, don't criticize by name, just fire blanks." When the TDSL began its anti-rightist struggle, Xie released rumors saying "there are no rightists in the TDSL," and maliciously distorted the Party's rectification movement, saying: "Rectification is just for senior intellectuals." When the masses wanted the rightist element Shen Yi to confess her private conversations with another rightist element, Jiang Wenye, Xie Xuehong actually incited Shen Yi to say: "You can say you are a widow, private conversations are an insult to you." She also taught Shen to shift the blame to others, saying: "Anyway, the die is cast, you just say Chen Bingji (a member of the TDSL rectification leadership group) told you to stir up trouble." When it came time to criticize Shen Yi, Xie sent money and gifts to Shen, encouraging her to resist to the end "like a wild flower that can never be trampled to death."

Xie Xuehong had a set of reactionary political views. She denied the leadership of the Communist Party, saying "the TDSL is the core of the united front of all strata of people in Taiwan." She also absurdly said: "Taiwanese people do not understand the Communist Party, they have no good feelings towards the Communist Party, but they have good feelings towards the TDSL," attempting to replace the leadership of the Communist Party with the TDSL.

Xie Xuehong's confidants Yang Kehuang, Wang Sixiang and others wrote several pamphlets praising Xie, portraying Xie Xuehong as a great figure. Xie Xuehong distributed these books everywhere. Xie also wanted people to write dramas and operas about her "heroic history." In Hong Kong, Xie sent her autobiography and photos to the United States, Britain, Japan, and Southeast Asian countries, widely boasting about herself to capitalist countries. Xie also asked people to write articles calling her "the mother of the Taiwanese people" and "our great leader, Chairman Xie." At the general assembly of the North China General Branch of the TDSL, Xie's confidants mobilized the masses to pay "respects" to Xie, shouting "Long live the great leader of the Taiwanese people, Chairman Xie!" At this criticism meeting, someone questioned Xie about these things, and Xie actually replied: "It is necessary and natural to shout long live to me." In November 1950, Xie Xuehong originally planned to go abroad to attend an international conference. She printed more than a hundred photos, intending to distribute them along the way. Later, she did not go abroad, and she complained to others: "It's a pity, I almost became a famous international figure."

Xie Xuehong's organizational line served her personal ambitions. She consistently relied on counter-revolutionary elements, traitors, illegal capitalists, and various bad elements. When the TDSL headquarters was in Shanghai, Xie relied on counter-revolutionary elements Li Shanggen and Wang Sixiang, conspiring with them on matters big and small. In Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places, she also relied on traitors Yang Kepei, Guo Liang, and counter-revolutionary elements like Lin Zhenghan, and regarded these people as the leading backbone of local TDSL organizations. When these people were expelled from the league and dealt with according to law, Xie was extremely dissatisfied and continued to call for their grievances to be redressed.

When rightist elements frantically attacked the Party's anti-counterrevolutionary policy, Xie Xuehong was no exception. At a CPPCC inspection work symposium on January 22nd this year, she raised a number of cases, demanding rehabilitation. For example, the counter-revolutionary element Chen Changdai had been arrested according to law, but Xie still called for his grievance to be redressed. After the counter-revolutionary element Lin Zhenghan was sentenced to imprisonment, she still submitted to the procuratorial organs that Lin was not a counter-revolutionary element, demanding rehabilitation. When Wang Sixiang was definitely identified as a counter-revolutionary element, Xie said to others: "Wang Sixiang is a person who has a flesh-and-blood relationship with the revolution, he was framed." Xie Xuehong also adopted a position hostile to the Party on the policies of the Three-Anti, Five-Anti, and land reform campaigns.

Xie Xuehong has also consistently harbored hatred and used unscrupulous means to attack Communist Party members and leftists within the league. In Beijing, she instructed her confidants to monitor the actions of Party members and bribed a bad element in a certain agency to spread rumors saying: "Chen Bingji wants to kill Xie Xuehong." She also instructed people to falsely accuse Communist Party members to the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. She also carried out vicious attacks and framed the leaders of the TDSL leftists in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places. According to Shen Yi's exposure alone, there were already seventeen Party members and progressive people who were falsely accused by Xie Xuehong of being counter-revolutionary elements and counter-revolutionary suspects.

The meeting also revealed that Xie Xuehong used methods such as offering official positions, small favors, monetary bribes, and "fellow villager affection" to win over, deceive, and mislead some people, and cultivate personal influence.

Regarding Xie Xuehong's erroneous organizational line, the TDSL headquarters, under the leadership of the Party, had repeatedly criticized and corrected it. But she had always resisted. After the Communist Party put forward the principle of "long-term coexistence, mutual supervision," Xie Xuehong intensified her activities. Without discussing it with the headquarters, she privately submitted a list of chairmen and vice-chairmen, attempting to monopolize the TDSL organizations in various places and actively promote the organizational line of the rightists.

Xie Xuehong's becoming a rightist element has historical roots. The meeting revealed that she participated in the revolution in her early years. After being arrested in Taiwan in 1931, she betrayed and surrendered, and has been concealing the criminal fact of selling out her comrades. It was not until this criticism meeting, when Yang Chunsong, whom she had betrayed, exposed her on the spot, that she was embarrassed and lost color. After Xie was released from prison, she had close contacts with Japanese spies and ran "Sanmei Hall," treating Japanese soldiers with special cordiality and being called "a soldier's home." After Japan surrendered, Xie ran "Dahua Restaurant" and did many unspeakable things. In 1947, the people of Taiwan launched the heroic "February 28th" uprising. Although Xie participated in the uprising in the Taichung area, when the masses unanimously demanded the shooting of Liu Cunzhong, the puppet Taichung county magistrate who had blood debts, Xie shielded him and insisted on sending Liu Cunzhong back to the puppet police station for protection. Xie also did her best to relieve the siege of the Kuomintang reactionaries in various other places. When the Kuomintang reinforcements counterattacked Taichung, Xie, regardless of the life and death of the uprising troops, took away NT$100,000 of public funds donated by the people and fled to Puli with Yang Kehuang. When the enemy attacked Puli, Xie abandoned the people's armed forces and ran away with Yang again. On the way to escape, seeing news reports that Chiang Ching-kuo was going to suppress the "February 28th" incident, she wrote a letter to Chiang Ching-kuo, introducing herself as a Kuomintang member and asking Chiang Ching-kuo to "handle it leniently." Xie Xuehong has been promoting herself as a "February 28th" heroine, but in fact she was a "February 28th" deserter.

The TDSL headquarters thoroughly exposed and criticized Xie Xuehong's anti-Party and anti-socialist crimes, but in the face of conclusive evidence and witnesses, Xie Xuehong did not admit the facts, repeatedly lied and denied them in public, even reversing black and white and confusing right and wrong, sometimes even slamming the table, glaring, and being unreasonable. She even insulted "all league members are anti-Party and anti-socialist." Xie Xuehong's stubborn attitude aroused the infinite anger of the masses. The local organizations of the TDSL have sent letters of denunciation signed by all league members, and all league members unanimously demand that the rightist element Xie Xuehong must thoroughly confess, bow her head and admit her guilt, and she must not be allowed to carry out anti-Party and anti-socialist criminal activities.

    台盟声讨叛徒谢雪红
    “二·二八女英雄”原来是个女逃兵
    狂妄自大网罗坏蛋是台盟右派的头目
    新华社25日讯　台湾民主自治同盟总部召集各地方组织代表和在京盟员从11月10日到12月8日举行多次会议揭露和批判台盟主席、右派分子谢雪红反党、反社会主义的罪行。据会上揭露，谢雪红是一个极端狂妄的个人野心家。
    谢雪红在1947年混入共产党，十年来，她以“老革命”和“二·二八女英雄”自居，目空一切，唯我独尊。共产党内曾对她长期进行过教育，耐心地等待她悔改。但是谢雪红始终抗拒党对她的教育，这次更利用党整风机会放出许多毒箭，向党进攻。
    在大鸣大放期间，谢雪红用各种方式点火。她在幕后主使台盟干部、右派分子沈毅攻击党的干部政策有宗派主义，诬蔑共产党员“无法无天，作威作福”；攻击统战政策是“宁左勿右”，“偏听偏信”。谢雪红又煽动高山族干部攻击台盟中的进步人士，说：你们高山族多来些人，不要放过机会，狠狠地整整他们（指进步人士）。并无耻地说：“只有我才是真正关心高山族人民”。谢还通过亲信串连台盟盟员、右派分子江文也等人挑拨共产党和华侨的关系，他们又为谢吹嘘说：“东京有个廖文毅，台湾有个蒋介石，大陆有个谢主席。”谢雪红还煽动台盟干部用写大字报等办法企图赶走在台盟的共产党员。谢雪红不仅在北京点火，她还到天津、广州去煽动右派分子向党进攻。
    谢雪红又积极阻挠和破坏反右派斗争。今年全国人民代表大会开会时，有一位代表要谢一道揭发章伯钧，谢却说：“不要落井下石，不要指名批判，放放空炮好了。”当台盟开始反右派斗争的时候，谢又放出空气说“台盟没有右派”，并且恶意地歪曲党的整风运动说：“整风只不过搞搞高级知识分子而已”。当群众要右派分子沈毅交代她和另一右派分子江文也的私房话，谢雪红竟教唆沈毅说：“你可以说你是寡妇，私房话是对你侮辱。”她还教沈嫁祸于人，说：“反正已撕破脸皮，你就说是陈炳基（台盟整风领导小组成员）叫你点火好了。”到了批判沈毅的时候，谢又送钱送礼给沈，鼓励她要“像永远踩不死的野花那样”顽抗到底。
    谢雪红有一套反动的政治主张，她否认共产党的领导，说“台盟是台湾各阶层人民统一战线的核心。”并荒唐地说：“台湾人对共产党不了解，对共产党没有好感，对台盟有好感。”企图以台盟代替共产党的领导。
    谢雪红的心腹杨克煌、王思翔等人写过几本吹捧谢的小册子，把谢雪红描绘为一个伟大的人物。而谢雪红把这些书到处分送。谢还要人为她的“英雄历史”编写话剧和歌剧。在香港时，谢把自己的自传和照片分寄美、英、日及东南亚各国，广为向资本主义国家作自我吹嘘。谢又叫人写文章，称她为“台湾人民的妈妈”，称她为“我们伟大的领袖谢主席”。在台盟华北总支部大会上，谢的亲信动员群众向谢“致敬”，喊出“伟大的台湾人民领袖谢主席万岁！”在这次批判会上，有人对这些事情向谢提出质问，谢竟回答说：“对我喊万岁是需要的，自然的。”1950年11月谢雪红原来准备出国参加一个国际会议，她印了一百多张照片，打算沿途分送。后来出国未成，她对人埋怨说：“很可惜，差一点我就成了著名的国际人物了。”
    谢雪红的组织路线是为她的个人野心服务的。她一贯依靠反革命分子、汉奸、不法资本家及各种坏分子。台盟总部在上海时，谢曾依靠反革命分子李上根、王思翔，事无大小皆与共谋。在北京、上海、广州等地也是依靠汉奸杨克培、郭良，反革命分子林政汉这一类人，并且把这些人作为台盟地方组织的领导骨干。当这些人被开除盟籍和依法处理后，谢极端不满，一直为他们呼冤、翻案。
    当右派分子疯狂地攻击党的肃反政策的时候，谢雪红也不例外，她在今年1月22日政协视察工作座谈会上提出一批案件，要求平反。如反革命分子陈昌岱已被依法逮捕，谢仍为他呼冤。反革命分子林政汉被判处徒刑后，她仍向检察机关提出林不是反革命分子，要求平反。当王思翔已肯定为反革命分子时，谢对人说：“王思翔是和革命有血肉关系的人，他是被人陷害的。”谢雪红对三反、五反、土改政策也采取和党敌对的立场。
    谢雪红还一贯仇视并不择手段地打击盟内的共产党员和左派。在北京，她指示亲信监视党员行动，收买某机关一个坏分子造谣说：“陈炳基要杀谢雪红。”她还指使人向中共中央纪律检查委员会诬告共产党员。她对上海、广州等地台盟左派的领导人也进行恶毒的打击和陷害。仅据沈毅揭发，被谢雪红诬告为反革命分子和反革命嫌疑分子的已有党员和进步人士十七名。
    会上还揭发了谢雪红用封官许愿、小恩小惠、金钱收买、“同乡感情”等手段，拉拢、蒙蔽和欺骗一些人，培植个人势力。
    对于谢雪红的错误的组织路线，台盟总部在党的领导下，曾多次加以批判和纠正。但是她一直反抗。在共产党提出“长期共存，互相监督”方针以后，谢雪红更变本加厉，四处活动。她未经总部讨论，私自提出了一批主委、副主委名单，企图一手包办各地台盟组织，积极推行右派的组织路线。
    谢雪红所以成为右派分子是有历史根源的。会上揭露，她早年参加革命。1931年在台湾被捕后变节自首，并一直隐瞒出卖同志的罪恶事实。直到这次批判会上，被她出卖过的杨春松当场揭发她时，她才狼狈失色。谢出狱后，和日本特务往来密切，经营“三美堂”，招待日本士兵特别亲切，被称为“兵之家”。日本投降后，谢又经营“大华酒家”，做了许多不可告人的勾当。1947年台湾人民爆发了英勇的“二·二八”起义。谢虽然在台中地区参加起义，但当群众一致要求枪毙有血债的伪台中县长刘存忠时，谢却加以包庇，硬将刘存忠送还伪警察局保护。谢还到其他各处尽力为国民党反动派解围。在国民党援军反攻台中时，谢不顾起义部队的死活，携走了人民捐献的公款台币十万元，和杨克煌张惶逃往埔里。当敌人进攻埔里时，谢又背弃人民武装和杨一起逃跑。在逃跑途中，看见报载蒋经国要去镇压“二·二八”事件的消息，她就写信给蒋经国，介绍她自己是国民党员，要求蒋经国“宽大处理”。谢雪红一直宣传自己是“二·二八”的女英雄，事实上她是“二·二八”的逃兵。
    台盟总部对谢雪红的反党、反社会主义罪行进行了彻底的揭露和批判，但谢雪红在确凿的人证物证之前，不承认事实，一再当众撒谎和抵赖，甚至颠倒黑白，混淆是非，有时还拍桌子，瞪眼睛，蛮不讲理。她甚至侮辱“全体盟员都是反党、反社会主义”。谢雪红的这种顽抗态度引起了群众的无比愤怒。台盟各地方组织纷纷发来了全体盟员签名的声讨书，全体盟员一致要求右派分子谢雪红必须彻底交代，低头认罪，绝不容许她进行反党、反社会主义的罪恶活动。
