Xinhua News Agency, Guan Zhuang, December 27th: The struggle to eliminate the "free kingdom" and the chaotic situation in Guan Zhuang has begun. The chaos in Guan Zhuang is prominently manifested in the long-term failure to effectively curb the criminal behavior of a small number of lawless elements. With the assistance of the State Council's Five-Person Working Group, the units stationed in Guan Zhuang jointly held a meeting of more than 7,000 people on the afternoon of the 26th, resolutely striking at a group of counter-revolutionary elements and criminal offenders.

At the meeting, Liu Zhiwu, Director of the Tongxian Public Security Bureau, based on materials exposed by the masses from various units, requested the approval of the Chief Procurator of the Tongxian People's Procuratorate and arrested on the spot current counter-revolutionary Wang Songhai, hooligan criminal Kang Shouchang, habitual thief Liu Junyi, and Liu Baoming. In addition, habitual thief Sun Xulai and hooligans Gao Jingliang and Yu Chunzhi were forcibly taken into custody for re-education through labor in accordance with the law. The whole audience applauded enthusiastically after Liu Zhiwu's announcement.

The arrested current counter-revolutionary Wang Songhai was a temporary worker at the Beijing Engineering Office of the Second Engineering Company of the Basic Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Building Materials Industry. On the second day of the arrival of the State Council's Five-Person Working Group in Guan Zhuang (i.e., December 12th), he openly wrote reactionary slogans on the wall, slandering the Communist Party and the leaders of the Chinese people. Hooligan Kang Shouchang was a concrete worker at the Beijing Engineering Office. Before liberation, when he was a deputy squad leader in the Kuomintang army, he extorted and blackmailed, beat the masses, burned houses, and raped women, committing all kinds of evil deeds. After liberation, he continued to insult women and abuse young girls. According to Kang Shouchang's own confession, he had raped four young girls, raped four women, and abused ten young girls. In addition, he also stole the property of workers. Habitual thief Sun Xulai is currently a full-time engineer in the Budget Section of the Building Materials Industry Design Institute. He has been stealing books for a long time since 1952 and has been demoted and had his salary reduced for this in the past. He also stole books from the Xinhua Bookstore on Wangfujing, Beijing, on November 24th of this year. At the same time, he often stole public property in the office and his character was extremely bad. Female hooligan Yu Chunzhi is a tracer at the Cement Industry Design Institute. She has been defrauding people of their property and has defrauded more than ten male comrades of money and goods in the name of love.

Zhang Zhixuan, a member of the State Council's Five-Person Working Group, spoke on behalf of the group at the meeting. He pointed out that the criminal situation of a small number of lawless elements in Guan Zhuang is very noteworthy. According to statistics from nine units of the Ministry of Building Materials Industry, 259 theft cases occurred in one year from October of last year to October of this year. Even after a group of bad elements were dealt with in a big way in November of this year, theft cases continued to occur. The unbridled criminal activities of hooligans seriously threatened the evening outings or activities of female comrades. The reason why theft and hooligan criminals dared to be so rampant is mainly that the local public security organs have not been strong enough in cracking down on criminals, and the internal security departments of the Guan Zhuang organs have not fulfilled their due responsibilities. Another extremely important aspect is that the political and ideological education work in the various units in Guan Zhuang is extremely weak, bourgeois decadent ideas have not been seriously criticized, and the handling of persistently criminal elements has been lax. In addition, certain lax systems also give opportunities to thieves, hooligans and other bad elements.

Su Jiguang, Director of the Design Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Building Materials Industry and Secretary of the Guan Zhuang Party Committee, said that these hooligans, thieves, and current counter-revolutionaries who were dealt with have mixed into state organs and carried out various destructive activities, exposing the serious bureaucracy existing in our leading organs. The leaders of the units stationed in Guan Zhuang have long held a tendency to neglect politics in their thinking, so that corrupt bourgeois ideas and customs that are detrimental to social morals and behaviors that violate laws and regulations have been able to grow and spread. He called on all Communist Party members and cadres in the organs stationed in Guan Zhuang to mobilize and wage a resolute struggle against all lawless and undisciplined bad elements.

Employee representatives expressed their enthusiastic support for the resolute measures taken by the Party and the government at the meeting. They said that this meeting was the beginning of changing the face of Guan Zhuang. They expressed that they would further improve their revolutionary vigilance, stand firmly on the working class's position, and wage a relentless struggle against all bad people and bad deeds.

At yesterday's meeting, Liu Zhiwu, Director of the Tongxian Public Security Bureau, announced that the Guan Zhuang Public Security Police Station would be formally established from December 26th to strengthen social security in Guan Zhuang and maintain public order. The whole audience applauded warmly in support of this decision. (Attached picture)

### 消灭“自由王国”的斗争开始了  管庄举行群众大会打击一批反革命和刑事犯罪分子

    消灭“自由王国”的斗争开始了
    管庄举行群众大会打击一批反革命和刑事犯罪分子
    新华社管庄27日电　消灭“自由王国”管庄混乱现象的斗争已经开始。管庄的混乱，突出地表现在少数违法乱纪分子的犯罪行为长期没有得到有力的制止。在国务院五人工作组的协助下，驻管庄各单位26日下午联合举行了七千多人的大会，坚决打击了一批反革命分子和刑事犯罪分子。
    会上，通县公安局局长刘志武根据各单位群众揭发的材料，提请县人民检察院检察长批准，当场逮捕了现行反革命分子王松海、流氓犯罪分子康寿昌，惯盗犯刘俊仪、刘宝明。另外，依法强制收容劳动教养的有惯盗孙旭来，流氓分子高景良、于春芝。刘志武宣布以后，全场热烈鼓掌。
    被逮捕的现行反革命分子王松海，是建筑材料工业部基本建设局第二工程公司北京工程处的一个临时工人，他在国务院五人工作组到达管庄的第二天（即12月12日），公然在墙上涂写反动标语，污蔑共产党和中国人民的领袖。流氓分子康寿昌，是北京工程处混凝土工人，解放前他在国民党军队中任副班长时，敲诈勒索，殴打群众，烧毁民房，强奸妇女，无恶不作；解放后仍然一贯侮辱妇女，摧残幼女。据康寿昌本人交代：他先后曾强奸幼女四人，奸污妇女四人，摧残幼女十人。此外，还盗窃工人的财物。惯盗孙旭来，现为建筑材料工业设计院预算科专职工程师，他从1952年以来长期偷盗书籍，过去曾为此受到降职降薪处分。今年11月24日还在北京王府井新华书店偷书。同时他在机关内经常偷窃公家东西，品质极为恶劣。女流氓于春芝，是水泥工业设计院的描图员，她一贯诈骗财物，先后以恋爱为名骗取了十多个男同志的金钱及物品。
    国务院五人工作组组员张之轩代表五人工作组在会上讲了话。他指出，管庄少数违法乱纪分子的犯罪情况是十分值得注意的。据建筑材料工业部九个单位统计，从去年10月到今年10月，一年内就发生盗窃案件二百五十九起，在今年11月份大张旗鼓地处理了一批坏分子后，盗窃案件仍不断发生。流氓分子无法无天的犯罪活动，严重地威胁着女同志的夜晚外出或活动。盗窃、流氓犯罪分子所以敢于这样猖狂，主要是地方公安机关对犯罪分子的打击不够，管庄机关内部保卫部门也没有尽到应有的责任。另外一个极其重要的方面，就是管庄各单位政治思想教育工作极为薄弱，资产阶级腐朽思想一直没有受到严肃的批判，对于一贯犯罪的分子处理不严。此外，某些制度松弛也给盗窃、流氓等坏分子以可乘之机。
    建筑材料工业部设计管理局局长、管庄党委书记苏继光说，这些被处理的流氓、偷盗犯和反革命现行犯混进了国家机关，进行各种破坏活动，暴露出我们领导机关存在着严重的官僚主义，驻在管庄各单位领导思想上长期存在着忽视政治的倾向，以致使腐朽的资产阶级思想和伤风败俗、违法乱纪的行为得以滋长、蔓延。他号召驻管庄机关的全体共产党员和干部动员起来，向一切违法乱纪的坏分子进行坚决的斗争。
    职工代表在会上表示热烈拥护党和政府所采取的这种坚决措施，他们说，这个大会是改变管庄面貌的开端。他们表示要进一步提高革命警惕性，站稳工人阶级立场，向一切坏人坏事作无情的斗争。
    在昨天的大会上，通县公安局局长刘志武宣布，从12月26日起，正式成立管庄公安派出所，加强管庄的社会治安，维护公共秩序。全场群众热烈鼓掌，拥护这个决定。（附图片）
    12月26日，驻在管庄的中央各单位联合召开七千多人的群众大会，当众处理了七个一贯扰乱治安的反革命分子和刑事犯。这是群众大会会场。
