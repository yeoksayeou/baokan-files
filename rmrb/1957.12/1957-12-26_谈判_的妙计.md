    A Clever Trick of "Negotiation"
    General Norstad told American television viewers that negotiations with the Soviet Union "must be based on very real strength" and that the West cannot "sit here and do nothing." This means that instead of stopping the arms race through negotiation, they are using negotiation as a cover to advance towards war preparations.
    A "New York Times" dispatch made another comment: the negotiations agreed to by the United States at the Paris conference are merely appealing to former Secretary of State Acheson's old policy of letting strength speak for itself. Thus, negotiation again means standing still.
    Negotiation cannot hinder the arms expansion, cannot "sit here and do nothing," while negotiation can only proceed from a position of strength, stubbornly "sitting here and doing nothing." Herein lies the clever trick of negotiation.

    “谈判”的妙计
    诺斯塔德将军对美国电视听众说，同苏联谈判“必须有非常实在的力量作基础”，西方不能“坐在这里不动”。这就是说不是通过谈判来停止军备竞赛，而是拿谈判做幌子，以便向备战前进。
    “纽约时报”的电讯，作了另一注释：美国在巴黎会议上同意的谈判，不过是乞灵于前国务卿艾奇逊的让实力地位讲话的老政策。这样，谈判又是意味着站在原来的地方不动了。
    谈判不能妨碍扩军，不能“坐在这里不动”而谈判又只能从实力出发，硬是“坐在这里不动”。谈判妙计在此。
