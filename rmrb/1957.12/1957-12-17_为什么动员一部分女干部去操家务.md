    Why Mobilize Some Female Cadres to Manage Household Affairs

    Some people can't understand: Why did we previously advocate and mobilize women to participate in social work, but now we are mobilizing some female cadres to retire and engage in household labor? Is there a contradiction between the two? We say that there is no contradiction between the two. It must be understood that our new society has always advocated that women have the same rights as men to participate in various social labors, and this principle will never be shaken. It was like this in the past, it is like this now, and it will be like this in the future. Precisely because of this, we advocate that women participate in various social labors. New China needs female drivers, female tractor drivers, female captains, female engineers.... The problem is that we must distinguish between principles and specific practices determined according to specific circumstances. The current mobilization of some women to retire and engage in household labor is a specific practice determined according to specific circumstances. Based on the current situation of excessive staff in government offices, and the specific circumstances of some female cadres having many children, being physically weak, or other factors, their role in doing a good job in family work after retiring will be greater than their role as employees. Since this is more beneficial to socialist construction, it should be done. This approach, which only mobilizes a small number of female employees to return to family positions that are more suitable for their specific circumstances, is clearly a different matter from opposing women's participation in social work. Therefore, this current practice does not contradict our principle of advocating that women have the right to participate in social labor. In fact, in the future, more women will participate in various social labors just like men. At the same time, it must also be understood that while we advocate that women have the same right as men to participate in social labor, we never underestimate women's engagement in household labor. We should never advocate women's participation in various social labors on the basis of underestimating household labor (many female comrades now misunderstand this in this way), because household labor and other social labors are not opposed to each other. According to the naturally formed division of labor in human society, women have always been the main undertakers of household labor, and household labor will be an indispensable part of the entire social labor even in communist society. Therefore, even in communist society, many women will still engage in household labor. We cannot imagine what society would become if all women in society went to engage in other social labor and no one engaged in household labor anymore. Then, should a woman engage in household labor or participate in other social labor? This should be determined based on the specific situation of the woman. She should participate in whichever labor contributes more to socialism.

### 为什么动员一部分女干部去操家务

    为什么动员一部分女干部去操家务
    有些人想不明白：为什么我们过去曾提倡过和动员过妇女参加社会工作，现在却又动员一部分女干部退职从事家务劳动，这二者有无矛盾？我们说，这二者是没有矛盾的。必须了解，我们新社会是一向主张妇女有同男人一样的参加社会上各种劳动的权利的，这个原则是永远不会动摇的。过去是这样、现在是这样、将来还是这样。正因为这样，我们提倡妇女参加社会中的各种劳动。新中国需要有女司机、女拖拉机手、女船长、女工程师……。问题在于，我们必须将原则同根据具体情况决定的具体作法区别开。现在动员一部分妇女退职从事家务劳动，这是根据具体情况确定的具体作法。根据现在机关工作人员过多，而某些妇女干部因小孩多、身体弱或其他等具体情况，她们退职回家做好家庭工作所起的作用会比做职员的作用更大。既然这样对社会主义建设更有利就应当这样做。而这样仅仅动员很少一部分女职员回到更适合她们具体情况的家庭岗位的作法，同反对妇女参加社会工作显然是不同的两回事。所以，现在这个作法同我们提倡妇女有参加社会劳动的权利的原则是并不矛盾的。事实上，今后还会有更多妇女与男子同样参加社会的各种劳动的。同时还必须了解，我们提倡妇女与男人同样有参加社会的劳动的权利的同时，也决不轻视妇女从事家务劳动。我们决不应该在轻视家务劳动的思想基础上来主张妇女参加社会上的各种劳动（现在有不少女同志就是这样错误的来理解的），因为家务劳动与社会上其他各种劳动并不是对立的。根据人类社会的自然形成的分工，妇女从来就是家务劳动的主要承担者，而家务劳动就是到共产主义社会也会是整个社会劳动的不可缺少的一部分，因此，就是到共产主义社会，也还会有许多妇女要从事家务劳动的。我们不可能设想，如果社会中所有的妇女都去从事其他社会劳动去了，没有人再从事家务劳动，那社会将会变成什么样子。那么，一个妇女是应当从事家务劳动，还是应当参加其他的社会劳动呢？这就要根据这位妇女的具体情况而定，参加那种劳动对社会主义的贡献更大些，就应参加那种。
