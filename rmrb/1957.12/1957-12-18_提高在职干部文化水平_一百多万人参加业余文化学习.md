    To Improve the Cultural Level of On-the-Job Cadres
    Over One Million People Participate in After-Work Cultural Studies
    (Our Newspaper News) After-work cultural studies for on-the-job cadres have been widely developed. Cadre after-work cultural schools have been generally established in agencies above the county level throughout the country, and cultural studies for cadres (full-time) in some districts and townships have also been organized. By the first semester of the 1956 academic year, approximately 1.3 million agency cadres and 400,000 other staff members nationwide had participated in after-work cultural studies. From 1952 to the first semester of the 1956 academic year, more than 230,000 people have been lifted out of illiteracy, more than 450,000 have improved to the equivalent of upper primary school graduation level, more than 80,000 have improved to the equivalent of junior high school graduation level, and more than 600 have improved to the equivalent of senior high school graduation level. The cultural outlook of agency cadres has undergone great changes. For example, in the Chengdu Public Security Bureau, among the cadres who participated in cultural studies in 1953, illiterates and semi-illiterates accounted for 38%, those with upper primary school level accounted for 48%, and those with junior high school level accounted for only 14%. However, by the autumn of 1956, the number of cadres with junior high school level had risen to 73%, the number of cadres with upper primary school level had fallen to 26%, and illiteracy and semi-illiteracy among cadres had been basically eliminated. The working ability of the vast number of worker-peasant cadres has been significantly improved as a result of learning culture.
    The Party and the government also selectively transferred main responsible cadres with lower cultural levels, such as district heads, district party secretaries, county heads, and county party secretaries, to study off the job. Because they have heavy workloads and high mobility, it is more difficult to persist in systematic cultural studies in their spare time. At present, all provinces and cities have established cadre off-the-job cultural schools. In the first semester of the 1956 academic year, there were more than 73,000 people studying in cadre off-the-job cultural schools. From 1954 to the first semester of the 1956 academic year, more than 24,000 people were lifted out of illiteracy through off-the-job study, more than 30,000 people improved to the equivalent of upper primary school graduation level, and more than 9,900 people improved to the equivalent of junior high school graduation level.
    Some places have implemented the spirit of the central government's instruction to "focus on absorbing worker-peasant cadres who bear certain leadership responsibilities to participate in study" when organizing cadres to participate in after-work cultural studies. Hangzhou County, Zhejiang Province, specifically organized leadership cadre study classes, absorbing cadres above the district level to enroll, and adopted the learning method of "centralized classes, decentralized self-study, and specialized tutoring" according to their work characteristics. Some places have also opened special classes (groups) for veteran cadres, granting them the cultural knowledge they most urgently need.
    The cadres' enthusiasm for learning is very high. In particular, some leading cadres, in learning culture, are diligent in their studies, respect their teachers, are not late, and do not miss classes, driving and influencing the learning of the vast number of cadres. Kong Xianlian, Secretary of the CPC Hangzhou County Committee in Zhejiang Province, and Geng Xin, Deputy Manager of the Jiangxi Provincial Insurance Company, were both selected as learning models due to their active learning and excellent results.
    At present, many regions have adhered to after-work cultural studies for cadres during the rectification campaign. After comprehensive arrangements in Hu County, Shaanxi Province, after-work cultural schools have been established in counties and districts. 94.5% of the cadres in county-level agencies who should learn culture have already enrolled, and the participation of district and township cadres in cultural studies has also reached 87.4% of the number of people who should learn culture. However, the current quality of teaching in cadre cultural education is not high, the leading cadres in after-work schools are weak, and there are still some problems with the guiding principles, objectives, teaching materials, and teaching plans of cadre cultural education. The Ministry of Education will study and solve these problems in conjunction with the rectification.

### 提高在职干部文化水平  一百多万人参加业余文化学习

    提高在职干部文化水平
    一百多万人参加业余文化学习
    本报讯　在职干部的文化学习已经有了广泛开展，全国县一级以上机关普遍开办了干部业余文化学校，部分地区区、乡干部（脱产）的文化学习也已经组织起来。到1956学年度第一学期止，全国约有一百三十万机关干部和四十万其他工作人员参加了业余文化学习。从1952年到1956学年度第一学期，已经有二十三万多人摆脱了文盲状态，有四十五万多人提高到相当于高小毕业水平，有八万多人提高到相当于初中毕业水平，有六百多人提高到了相当于高中毕业水平。机关干部的文化面貌已经起了很大变化。例如成都市公安局在1953年参加文化学习的干部中，文盲、半文盲占38％，高小程度的占48％，初中程度的只占14％，但是，到1956年秋季，初中程度的干部人数上升到73％，高小程度的干部人数下降到26％，干部中的文盲、半文盲已经基本上扫除。广大工农干部由于学得了文化，他们的工作能力有了显著提高。
    党和政府还分批抽调文化程度较低的区长、区委书记、县长、县委书记等主要负责干部离职学习。因为他们工作任务繁重，流动性大，在业余时间坚持系统的文化学习困难较多。目前，各个省市都开办有干部离职文化学校。1956学年度第一学期，在干部离职文化学校学习的就有七万三千多人。从1954年到1956学年度第一学期，通过离职学习有二万四千余人摆脱了文盲状态，有三万人提高到相当于高小毕业的水平，有九千九百余人提高到相当于初中毕业的水平。
    有的地方在组织干部参加业余文化学习时，贯彻了中央指出的“着重吸收担负一定领导责任的工农干部参加学习”的精神。浙江省杭县专门组织了领导干部学习班，吸收区级以上干部入学，并且根据他们的工作特点，采取了“集中上课，分散自学，专人辅导”的学习方式。有的地方还开设了老干部特别班（组），授予他们最迫切需要的文化知识。
    干部的学习情绪都很高涨。特别是有的领导干部，在学习文化中勤学尊师，不迟到，不缺课，带动和影响了广大干部的学习。中共浙江省杭县县委书记孔宪连和江西省保险公司副经理耿新，由于学习积极，成绩优良，都曾被评选为学习模范。
    目前，不少地区在整风期间都坚持了干部的业余文化学习。陕西省鄠县经过全面安排，县、区都开办了业余文化学校，县级机关应当学文化的干部94.5％已经入学，区、乡干部参加文化学习的也已达到应当学习文化人数的87.4％。但是，当前干部文化教育工作教学质量不高，业余学校的领导干部薄弱，干部文化教育的方针、目的、教材、教学计划等，还有一些问题。对于这些问题，教育部将结合整改加以研究解决。
