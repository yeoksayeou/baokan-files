To Section Chief Wu
(A Big-Character Poster from a Certain Organization)

    Accounting Section, Section Chief Wu,
    Handles affairs steadily, with broad experience.
    To raise shortcomings, there are two,
    Passive work is the main one.
    Considers much, decides little,
    Fears making mistakes, can't bear it;
    Encounters things, asks the leadership,
    Do as told, small responsibility.
    Furthermore, has a volatile temper,
    Didn't do well in uniting the section;
    Discussing issues, lacks composure,
    Criticism of work is even less.
    Is it right? Don't be angry,
    Actively improve your work style!

    给吴科长
　　（某机关的一张大字报）
    会计科，吴科长
    办事稳健经验广。
    提缺点，有两条，
    工作被动占主要。
    考虑多，决定少，
    怕出错误受不了；
    遇见事，问领导，
    咋说咋办责任小。
    再就是，脾气躁，
    科内团结没做好；
    谈问题，欠沉着，
    批评工作更是少。
    对不对？别生气，
    改进作风要积极！
