Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The United States' farcical failure to launch an artificial Earth satellite continues to be a topic of discussion in public opinion in various countries.

The Berlin Christian Democratic Union's newspaper, "Neue Zeit," wrote when discussing the failure of the United States to launch an artificial Earth satellite: December 6, 1957, was not only a day of technological failure for the United States, but also a failure of its economy, politics, and propaganda—all the infamous aspects of the American way of life. The "Farmer's Echo" said that Western politicians had to remain silent, and the failure of the American attempt only made it more embarrassed. The superiority of the socialist camp over the capitalist camp has once again been demonstrated.

Indian newspapers believe that the failure of the United States to launch an artificial satellite once again demonstrates that the United States lags behind the Soviet Union in important science and technology. "The Statesman" stated affirmatively in its editorial on the 8th that the United States attempted to respond to the Soviet Union's achievements by realizing its satellite launch plan, but this attempt failed again. "The National Herald" wrote that the fact that the United States cannot even launch a small satellite now has caused deep disappointment in the United States and the entire Western world. "The Hindustan Times" also has the same view on this event.

British newspapers, in commenting on the embarrassing failure of the United States to launch a satellite, emphasized that this failure is not only a technological failure for the United States, but also a failure of its "Cold War policy."

The Labour Party's "Daily Herald" said in its commentary today that what exploded in Florida was not only the American rocket, but also the American assumption that "the United States always possesses greater destructive power than Russia and will therefore eventually win the political Cold War. This assumption is based on the American illusion that the rest of the world is mostly composed of farmers who cannot match American technical knowledge. This assumption has also been shattered, which is a good thing."

"Washington at a Loss," "Universal Disappointment," "The failure on the eve of the opening of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting has brought shame and dejection to American leaders," these are the words used by Italian newspapers in commenting on the failure of the United States to launch a satellite. "La Nazione" published an editorial saying that this failure is the result of scientists in the United States being neglected, serving only a few people and acting as tools in the hands of privileged figures. It is not the American scientists, technicians, and workers who have failed, but those who command them. The Italian news agency said, "The helplessness caused by the American failure is universal. This is a most ominous omen for the upcoming North Atlantic Alliance Council meeting. The prestige of the United States has suffered a serious blow."

### 卫星坠地　威信扫地  美国继续受到各方的嘲笑

　　卫星坠地　威信扫地
    美国继续受到各方的嘲笑
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：美国发射人造地球卫星失败的丑剧，继续成为各国舆论的话柄。
    柏林基督教民主联盟机关报“新时报”在谈到美国发射人造地球卫星失败时写道：1957年12月6日这一天，不仅仅是美国技术遭到失败，而且它的经济、政治和宣传——所有恶名昭彰的美国生活方式也都遭到了失败。“农民回声报”说，西方政治家不得不哑口无言，美国尝试的失败只能使它更加狼狈不堪。社会主义阵营对资本主义阵营的优越性又一次显示出来了。
    印度报纸认为美国发射人造卫星的失败，又一次说明了美国在重要的科学技术方面落后于苏联。“政治家报”在8日的社论中肯定地说，美国企图以实现发射卫星的计划来回答苏联的成就，可是这种尝试又失败了。“国民先驱报”写道，美国现在连很小的卫星都不能发射，这个事实在美国以及整个西方世界引起了深深的失望。“印度斯坦时报”对这一事件也有同样的看法。
    英国报纸在评论美国发射卫星的丢脸失败时着重指出，这种失败不仅是美国技术上的失败，同时也是它的“冷战政策”的失败。
    工党的“每日先驱报”今天在评论中说，在佛罗里达爆炸的除了美国的火箭外，还有美国的关于“美国始终拥有比俄国更大的破坏力、因此终将赢得政治冷战的假定。这种假定是根据美国的幻想：以为世界其他部分大都是由农民所组成的，无法与美国的技术知识相匹敌。这种假定也被爆炸得粉碎，这是一件很好的事情”。
    “华盛顿束手无策”、“普遍失望”，“北大西洋公约组织理事会会议开幕前夕的失败使美国领导人蒙受耻辱、垂头丧气”，这些是意大利报纸在评论美国发射卫星失败时的语句。“国家报”发表社论说，这次失败是为少数人服务的、并且作为特权人物手里的工具的科学家们在美国受到轻视的结果。失败的不是美国的科学家、技术人员和工人，而是那些指挥他们的人。意大利通讯社说，“由于美国的失败而引起的束手无策是带有普遍性的。这对即将举行的北大西洋联盟理事会会议是一个最不吉的预兆。美国的威信已遭到严重的打击”。
