　　We Must Not Neglect Rectification, But Also Do a Good Job in Production
    The CPC Hunan Provincial Committee Inspects Production and Rectification Work in Communes

    (Our dispatch) The CPC Hunan Provincial Committee, at a telephone conference of prefectural committee secretaries held on the evening of the 7th, instructed all localities to immediately overcome the shortcomings of imbalance and lack of thoroughness in winter production, and the tendency to emphasize production while neglecting rectification.

    At present, a high tide of winter production has been formed throughout Hunan Province, and the progress of winter planting, water conservancy, manure accumulation, and plowing has greatly exceeded any year in history.

    However, the Provincial Committee pointed out that there are still many shortcomings in the movement. A few areas in the province have not done a good enough job; within a county, a township, or a commune, the progress of the movement is still uneven. Some points are doing very well, but the overall picture is not good enough. In some places, in the midst of vigorously developing water conservancy and increasing fertilizer accumulation, there is still a bias toward focusing on quantity and not paying attention to quality.

    In order to make the high tide of winter production more widespread and in-depth, the Provincial Committee demanded that all backward areas immediately catch up. In water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation work, it is necessary to resolutely implement the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results, and to demand quantity as well as ensure quality. After the production plan has been drawn up, effective measures must be taken accordingly to ensure that the specific organizational work keeps up and guarantees the realization of the production plan.

    In terms of rural rectification, the 800 agricultural cooperatives that are currently being carried out in the first batch have entered the stage of concentrated rectification, and the more than 23,000 cooperatives that are being carried out in the second batch have also initially formed a high tide of free airing of views and vigorous debate after launching production. The overall progress of the movement is generally healthy and normal. However, in the first batch of cooperatives, there are still a few places where rectification is not effective; in the second batch of cooperatives, some cadres believe that the work is now very heavy and the time is too tight, so they do not want to seriously organize the masses to speak out freely. The Provincial Committee pointed out: This tendency to emphasize production and neglect rectification is wrong. Doing so not only violates the purpose of rectification, but will also directly affect the enthusiasm of the masses, affect the further development of the production movement, and affect the consolidation of the cooperative.

    In order to continue to do a good job in rural rectification and truly achieve that both production and rectification are not neglected, the Provincial Committee instructed all localities to immediately convene on-the-spot summary meetings in separate areas, conduct a general training of cadres, educate cadres to overcome all ideas that are not conducive to the free airing of views and vigorous debate, resolutely support the masses' enthusiasm for speaking out, and at the same time earnestly improve their work. It is absolutely not allowed to let the rectification work slip by lightly. Whatever can be changed now should be changed immediately. In the process of rectification, we should currently focus particularly on improving production management and the problems of cadre work style. In places where it cannot be changed without rectifying the Party, we should first focus on rectifying the Party and the Youth League. In this regard, responsible comrades in all localities must also personally go to the front line to earnestly inspect and deploy the work, so that they can obtain direct experience.

    Because it is also necessary to combine the year-end work of grain collection, saving grain, year-end distribution of cooperatives, and conscription in the production and rectification movement, the winter work tasks are quite heavy. The Provincial Committee finally demanded that all localities make comprehensive arrangements so that all tasks can be completed in a timely manner, in order to uniformly promote greater development of agricultural production.

### 不能忽视整风　也要搞好生产  中共湖南省委检查生产整社工作

　　不能忽视整风　也要搞好生产
    中共湖南省委检查生产整社工作
    本报讯　中共湖南省委在7日晚召开的地委书记电话会议上，指示各地立即克服冬季生产中不平衡、不扎实，和偏重生产，轻视整风的缺点。
    目前湖南全省的冬季生产高潮已经形成，冬种、水利、积肥、犁田的进度，都大大超过历史上任何一年。
    但是，省委指出运动还存在不少缺点。全省有少数地区搞得不够好；在一县、一乡、一社之内，运动进展仍不平衡。有的点上搞得很好，面上不够好。有些地方在大搞水利、增积肥料中，也还有注重数量、不注重质量的偏向。
    为了使冬季生产高潮更普遍深入的开展，省委要求所有一切后进地区立即赶上来。在水利积肥工作上坚决贯彻多快好省的方针，既要要求数量，又要保证质量。在生产计划订好以后，必须相应地做出有效措施，使具体组织工作跟上去，保证生产计划的实现。
    在农村整风方面，现在全省第一批开展的八百个农业社已经进入集中整改阶段，第二批开展的二万三千多个社在掀起生产以后，也已初步形成大鸣大放的高潮。整个运动进展一般是健康的，正常的。但是在第一批社中仍有少数地方整改不力；在第二批社中也有干部认为现在工作很重，时间太紧，因此就不想在群众中认真地组织鸣放了。省委指出：这种重视生产轻视整风的偏向是不对的。这样做不仅违反了整风的目的，同时将直接影响群众的积极性，影响生产运动的进一步开展，影响合作社的巩固。
    为了继续搞好农村整风，使生产整风真正做到两不误，省委指示各地立即分片召开战地总结会议，普遍整训一次干部，教育干部克服一切不利于大鸣大放的思想，坚决支持群众的鸣放热忱，同时切实改进工作。绝对不许将整风工作轻轻的滑过去。凡是现在能改的马上就改，在整改中，目前特别应该着重在改进生产管理和干部作风上的问题。在不整党就改不下去的地方，就应该首先着重整顿一下党团。在这方面，各地负责同志同样必须亲临前线，认真检查和部署工作，使自己取得直接经验。
    由于在生产、整风运动中，还必须结合做好今年粮食扫尾、节约用粮、合作社年终分配和征兵工作，冬季工作任务相当繁重，省委最后要求各地做好全面安排，使各项工作都能及时完成，以统一促进农业生产的更大发展。（黄驭白）
