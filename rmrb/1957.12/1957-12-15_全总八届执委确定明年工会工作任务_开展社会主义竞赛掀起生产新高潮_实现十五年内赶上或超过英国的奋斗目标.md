Xinhua News Agency, December 14th: The first meeting of the Eighth Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) concluded this morning. The meeting discussed the tasks of the trade union work for 1958.

Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the ACFTU, pointed out at the meeting that the central task of trade union organizations at all levels in the future is to conscientiously implement the resolutions of the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions, mobilize the broad masses of workers to launch a socialist emulation drive, usher in a new upsurge in production to greet the Second Five-Year Plan, and strive to achieve the great goal of catching up with or surpassing Britain in the output of steel and other important industrial products within the next fifteen years.

Lai Ruoyu then spoke about several specific issues of trade union work in the future. He pointed out: First, with the development of the rectification movement in factories and mines, the political and labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers has been unprecedentedly high, and extremely favorable conditions are in place for launching a new mass upsurge in production. Therefore, trade union organizations at all levels must be fully prepared in mobilizing workers to launch a socialist emulation drive, do a good job in organizing rationalization proposals, and pay attention to summarizing and promoting various advanced experiences. Second, trade union organizations at all levels must take advantage of this rectification movement to earnestly improve the leadership style of trade union work, organize trade union cadres to strengthen labor training, educate trade union cadres at all levels to closely connect with the masses, and better grasp the Party's policies. In the enterprise rectification movement, it is also necessary to pay attention to giving play to the role of the workers' representative assembly and doing a good job in the work of trade union groups. Third, trade union organizations at all levels should always pay attention to the lives of the workers. However, in caring for and improving the living welfare of the workers, it is necessary to proceed from the perspective of 600 million people and prevent the living standards of workers from being too different from those of farmers. At the same time, when solving the welfare problems of workers, trade union organizations must adhere to the principle of diligence and thrift in running all undertakings, strive to do more with less money as much as possible, and pay attention to educating workers not to make excessive demands. Fourth, strengthen the ideological education of young workers. Trade union organizations at all levels must not only warmly care about the production, life, and ideological situation of young workers, but also constantly conduct ideological education among them, and pay attention to correcting some of their incorrect ideological understandings. Fifth, trade union organizations at all levels must also strengthen publicity and education work.

After discussion, the executive committee members and alternate executive committee members present unanimously agreed with Lai Ruoyu's speech.

    全总八届执委确定明年工会工作任务
    开展社会主义竞赛掀起生产新高潮
    实现十五年内赶上或超过英国的奋斗目标
    新华社14日讯　中华全国总工会第八届执行委员会第一次会议在今天上午结束。会议讨论了1958年工会工作的任务。
    全国总工会主席赖若愚在会上指出，各级工会组织今后的中心任务，就是认真贯彻执行中国工会第八次全国代表大会的决议，发动广大职工群众开展社会主义竞赛，掀起新的生产高潮，迎接第二个五年计划，并且为实现在今后十五年在钢铁及其他重要工业产品的产量方面赶上或超过英国的这个伟大目标而奋斗。
    赖若愚接着谈到今后工会工作的几个具体问题。他指出：一、通过厂矿企业整风运动的开展，广大职工群众的政治热情和劳动热情空前高涨，掀起一个群众性的新的生产高潮已经具备了十分有利的条件。因此，各级工会组织在发动职工群众开展社会主义竞赛中，必须充分作好准备工作，做好合理化建议的组织工作，注意总结和推广各种先进经验。二、各级工会组织必须通过这次整风运动，认真改进工会工作的领导作风，组织工会干部加强劳动锻炼，教育各级工会干部密切联系群众，更好地掌握党的方针政策。在企业的整风运动中，还必须注意发挥职工代表大会的作用，做好工会小组工作。三、各级工会组织应该时刻注意关心职工群众的生活。但是在关心和改善职工的生活福利问题上，必须从六亿人口出发，使工人同农民的生活水平不致悬殊过大。同时，在解决职工生活福利问题的时候，工会组织必须掌握勤俭办一切事业的原则，尽可能作到少花钱多办事，并且注意教育职工不要提出过高的要求。四、加强青年工人的思想教育工作。各级工会组织一方面必须热情地关怀青年工人的生产、生活和思想情况，另一方面又必须对他们经常地进行思想教育，注意纠正他们中间的一些不正确的思想认识。五、各级工会组织还必须加强宣传教育工作。
    到会的执行委员和候补执行委员经过讨论，一致同意赖若愚的发言。
