　　A Poem by an Overseas Chinese
　　Xie Lanqi
    On the National Day, words I want to say fill my throat,
    Happy tears stream down my face.
    Compatriots, quickly open the lychee cans,
    Quickly scoop out the jade-colored fruit.
    I see the trees of my hometown,
    Celebrating a bumper harvest for the first time in forty years.
    Compatriots, don't throw away these wine bottles,
    Don't throw away these tobacco tins.
    If you have time, come to my house again
    For a lively evening.
    My little grandson is waiting for me,
    He's not waiting to drink wine,
    He's not waiting to smoke tobacco.
    He wants to taste the flavor of hometown fruit,
    He wants to see from the cans and bottles
    Where is the red Tiananmen,
    Where is the green Changbai Mountain.

        The Embassy
    Whenever I come to the gate of the embassy,
    My heart surges with happy dizziness.
    The big red national emblem is bright red,
    The golden stars sparkle.
    It seems to be calling me from afar,
    Asking me if I am cold, asking if I am warm,
    Asking if this wanderer far from the motherland
    Is safe in body and mind.
    Whenever I enter the embassy's living room,
    My heart races like ten thousand horses.
    I see Chairman Mao walking slowly down
    From the photograph on the wall.
    He holds my hand and asks me
    If I often receive letters from home,
    If I often hear news of the motherland's construction,
    And also asks me what improvements should be made in overseas Chinese affairs.
    With tears and a smiling face,
    I tell him the hardships of the past forty years,
    And also tell him my heart is full of joy today.
    Whenever I leave the embassy,
    My heart is filled with the happiness of youth.
    I murmur softly in the streets at night,
    The night is deep, hazy with fog,
    But I am full of energy, with a clear sense of direction,
    Because I have a great motherland,
    I am a loyal citizen of the motherland.

　　一个华侨的诗篇
　　谢蓝绮
    十·一想说的话儿塞满喉快乐的泪儿满脸流乡亲们快打开荔枝的罐头快舀出玉色的果儿我看见了家乡的树儿四十年来第一次庆丰收乡亲们莫扔掉这盛酒的瓶瓶莫扔掉这装烟的罐罐你们要有闲空再到我家里过个热闹的夜晚我的小孙儿在等着我他不等着喝酒他不等着抽烟他要尝尝家乡的水果味他要从罐上瓶上看看哪儿是红色的天安门哪儿是绿色的长白山
        大使馆每当来到大使馆的门前我的心，激荡着快乐的晕眩大红的国徽红丹丹金色的星星光闪闪好像老远就在招呼我问我寒，问我暖问我这远离祖国的游子是不是心身平安每当走进大使馆的客厅我的心又如万马奔腾我看见毛主席从墙壁的照片上缓步而下他拉着手问我问我可常收到家里的来信可常听到祖国建设的新闻还问我侨务工作应该有那些改进我含泪又带着笑颜向他诉说四十年来往事的辛酸也告诉他今天的满心喜欢每当离开大使馆的时候我的心充满了青春的幸福我低声吟哦在夜的街头夜色已深，迷蒙有雾而我却是精神抖擞，方向分明因为我有一个伟大的祖国我是祖国的忠实公民
