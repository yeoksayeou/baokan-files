　　Advancing Towards a Yield of 1,800 Jin Per Mu
　　By Our Correspondent Yao Dan
    The farmers living in Junzi Village on the outskirts of Zizhong County, Sichuan, used to be troubled by this land. They were not troubled because the land was too poor, but because it was too fertile. Among them, more than fifty mu of paddy fields (which are flooded for most of the year to prevent drought) would collapse into the fields before the rice was fully ripe. As a result, each mu could only yield 200 to 300 jin. Therefore, some people simply did not grow rice and switched to growing mat grass.
    If ponds and dikes could be built, the water in the paddy fields could be drained, and a season of spring crops such as wheat and broad beans could be planted. This would not only add an extra season, but the rice would no longer collapse. The local experienced farmers had long considered this plan. But how to build? Who would build it? Not only did everyone not dare to dream of it before liberation, but it was also impossible to solve under individual management after land reform. In the autumn of 1954, a number of mutual aid teams were established in the village, and under the leadership of the government, the construction of a mountain bay pond began on the high ground of the paddy fields. Then, the Junzi Agricultural Cooperative, with 25 households participating, was established. In the spring of 1955, the Junzi Cooperative boldly drained more than eight mu of paddy fields for the first time and added a season of spring crops, setting a precedent for turning one-season fields into two-season fields in this area. As a result, these eight mu of fields yielded 854 jin per mu. In 1956, double-cropping rice was widely promoted in Sichuan. In addition to expanding the double-cropping fields to 47 mu, the Junzi Cooperative also tried planting more than seven mu of triple-cropping fields. Therefore, the yield per mu of paddy fields in this year rose to 1,064 jin.
    With the expansion of the replanting area, fertilizers, labor, and water conservancy must be increased accordingly. Encouraged by the annual increase in production, people whose confidence has been boosted have accumulated more than 1.5 million jin of green manure and compost this year, and the number of pigs has increased from more than 110 last year to nearly 200. Each mu of triple-cropping fields applies 17,000 jin of various fertilizers. After a year of arduous struggle, another bumper harvest has emerged. This year, the average yield per mu of more than 300 mu of cultivated land in the whole cooperative reached more than 1,240 jin, an increase of 20% over last year.
    According to the grain yield standard of the National Agricultural Development Program, the Junzi Cooperative has long exceeded it. But they did not think that production had reached its peak. An exciting production plan has been made: next year, the average yield of grain per mu of more than 300 mu of cultivated land in the whole cooperative will reach 1,800 jin.

　　向亩产一千八百斤前进
　　本报记者　姚丹
    住在四川资中县城边上君子村的农民，过去一直为这片土地苦恼着。他们苦恼的不是因为土地太薄，而是因为它太肥。其中有五十来亩冲田（为了防旱，这种田一年中有大半年积水），总是不等稻子完全成熟就一片片地倒在田中，因此，一般每亩田只能收二、三百斤。因此有些人甚至根本不种稻谷，改种席草。
    要是能够修起塘堰来，冲田中的积水就可放掉，先种上一季麦子胡豆之类的小春作物，这不仅多收一季，稻谷也不会再倒伏。另外的几十亩塝田，也能够做到年年满栽满插。这个算盘，当地的老农早就打过，可是，如何修？谁去修？不仅解放前大家不敢妄想，就是在土地改革后个体经营时也无法解决。1954年的秋季，村中成立了一批互助组，在政府领导下，在冲田的高处开始修建一口山湾塘。接着便成立了有二十五户参加的君子农业社。1955年春，君子社第一次大胆地将八亩多水田放干，增种了一季小春，开创了这一带变一季田为两季田的先例。结果，这八亩多田，每亩单产即达到八百五十四斤。1956年，双季稻在四川大面积推广。君子社除了将两季田扩大到四十七亩外，又试种了七亩多三季田。因此，这一年每亩水田的单产，上升到一千零六十四斤。
    随着复种面积的扩大，肥料、劳动力、水利，都要相应增加。在年年增产鼓舞下提高了信心的人们，今年他们已积的青肥、堆肥就有一百五十多万斤，毛猪也由去年的一百一十多头发展到将近两百头。三季田中每亩所施各种肥料达一万七千斤。经过一年来的艰苦奋斗，又一个大丰收，已经出现今年全社三百多亩耕地，平均每亩产量达到一千二百四十多斤，比去年又增加了20％。
    按照农业发展纲要粮食产量的标准，君子社早已超过了。但是他们并没有认为生产已经到顶。一个激动人心的生产规划已经作出了：明年全社三百多亩耕地，平均每亩要产粮食一千八百斤。
