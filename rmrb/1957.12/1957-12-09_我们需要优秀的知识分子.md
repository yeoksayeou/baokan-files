　　We Need Excellent Intellectuals
    Lü Bingyuan, Head of Shengli Agricultural Cooperative, Fuyang County, Zhejiang Province
    Recently, the newspapers have continuously published news about the transfer of government cadres to the countryside to participate in labor. The cooperative members are very concerned and often ask: "I wonder when the cadres from the province and county will be transferred. It would be best if we could send a few more to our cooperative, so that we will have more strength to achieve the '800 jin' target next year."
    During this rectification movement, after the Party put forward the call for intellectual cadres to "go down to the countryside and up to the mountains," I personally and the cooperative members sincerely supported it. This is really a good way to combine book knowledge with practical experience. Speaking of which, we have a deep understanding. In 1954, the County Agricultural Bureau assigned Comrade Jiang Gan, a recent graduate from an agricultural university, to our cooperative. He has been working in our cooperative for two or three years. After he promoted the advanced experiences of semi-dry seedling fields and yellow mud water selection in the cooperative, the seedlings grew strong every year, without rotting, and the season was advanced, realizing the wish to plant double-cropping rice. We all regard Comrade Jiang Gan as our own cooperative cadre. Although he does not directly participate in production, he is always with the cooperative members day and night. When the cooperative members are harvesting rice, he selects seeds in the fields; when the team is scoring points, he helps with bookkeeping; at night, he also runs technical night schools, giving lessons to the "technicians" in the cooperative according to the production season. Now the thirty-two technicians in our cooperative were trained by him. This spring, the higher authorities transferred Comrade Jiang Gan to work elsewhere, and everyone was reluctant to let him go. In order to achieve the 800 jin target, we are very much in need of cadres like this.
    Recently, our cooperative, in accordance with the requirements of the National Agricultural Development Program, has formulated a plan to buy water pumps, automatic rice threshers, rice transplanters, and grain dryers before 1962. To gradually realize the mechanization of agriculture, the cooperative members need cadres with culture and scientific knowledge to help even more. Now that the Party is going to send a large number of cadres with culture and scientific knowledge to participate in agricultural construction, it really makes us extremely happy. We hope that government cadres can come sooner and work with us to realize the National Agricultural Development Program!

　　我们需要优秀的知识分子
    浙江富阳县胜利农业社社长　吕冰元
    最近，报纸上连续发表了机关干部下放到农村参加劳动的消息，社员们十分关心，时常在问：省里、县里干部不知什么时候下放，我们社里最好多派几个来，这样明年实现“八百斤”指标就更有力量了。
    这次整风运动中，党提出知识分子干部“下乡上山”的号召后，我个人和社员们都是诚心诚意的拥护的，这真是书本知识与实际经验相结合的好办法。讲起来我们是有深刻体会的。1954年，县农业局分配一个农业大学刚毕业出来的江淦同志到我们社里来，一直在我们社里工作了二、三年。他在社里推广半旱秧田、黄泥水选种的先进经验以后，秧苗就年年长得茁壮，不烂秧，季节提早，种双季稻的愿望也实现了。我们都把江淦同志看作自己的社干部，他虽然不直接参加生产，但是白天黑夜总和社员们在一起。社员割稻，他在田里选种；小队里评分，他帮助记账；夜里还办技术夜校，按生产季节向社里的“技术员”上课，现在我们社里三十二个技术员就是他培养出来的。今年春天，上级把江淦同志调到别处去工作，大家都舍不得让他走。为了实现八百斤的指标，像这样的干部我们是很需要的。
    最近，我们社里根据农业发展纲要的要求，订出了规划，在1962年之前要买抽水机、自动打稻机、插秧机、烘谷机。要使农业逐步实现机械化，社员们更需要有文化和科学知识的干部来帮助。现在党要派大批有文化和科学知识的干部下来参加农业建设，真使我们万分高兴，我们希望机关干部能够早些来，和我们一道为实现农业发展纲要而奋斗！
