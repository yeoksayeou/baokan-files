　　Raise the Communist Consciousness of the Working Class
    Trade Union Representatives Emphasize Strengthening Political and Ideological Work
    According to Xinhua News Agency on the 11th, the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions continued its plenary discussion this afternoon.
    The executive chairman first read the congratulatory messages from the democratic parties to the congress.
    Eleven representatives from various regions spoke at today's meeting, expressing their opinions on further strengthening the political and ideological education of employees and striving to achieve China's tasks for the next fifteen years.
    He Bo (Vice Chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions) said in his speech that, judging from the current situation of the working class, with the development of socialist construction, a large number of non-working-class elements have joined the ranks of the working class, bringing the ideas of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie into the working class. In addition, the bourgeoisie and other non-working-class ideas constantly and continuously encroach on the working class. Therefore, in future trade union work, we must vigorously strengthen the political and ideological work for the masses of employees.
    Wu Ziyu (Vice Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions) and Xia Bingliu (Chairman of the Nanjing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions in Jiangsu Province) also mentioned in their speeches that it is necessary to strengthen the political and ideological education of young workers. Wu Ziyu said that in the past few years, Sichuan Province has added hundreds of thousands of new workers. Many of these workers were originally students, small producers, and farmers. They are generally young, energetic, and easily accept new things, but they have not undergone political struggle and collective labor training. This urgently requires trade union organizations to universally and deeply carry out rectification and socialist education movements to truly equip them with the qualities of the working class. Xia Bingliu said that the method of educating new workers should adhere to the combination of positive education and mass self-education, especially relying on veteran workers to educate new workers, organizing democratic debates (including big-character posters), inviting the parents of new workers or those they trust to visit the factory, and asking them to cooperate in educating new workers. These are all relatively effective methods.
    Wei Wenfeng (Secretary of the Party Committee of Shenyang Smelter) said in his speech that the key to correctly implementing the fundamental line of trade union work lies in strengthening the Party's leadership over trade union work. He believes that the enterprise party organization's leadership over trade union work is mainly achieved through party members in the trade union organization; the central task of trade union work is to carry out socialist competitions, so the Party must strengthen its leadership over the competitions; the Party must also support the mass supervision of the trade union, which can not only ensure the correctness of the trade union's supervision and enhance the strength of the trade union's supervision, but also place the Party's supervision on the basis of mass supervision, so that it is better able to play the role of the trade union as a link between the Party and the masses.
    In their speeches today, the representatives continued to express their warm support for the basic tasks put forward in the congratulatory message from the CPC Central Committee to the congress for the Chinese working class and the people of the whole country in the next ten to fifteen years. Li Jinghan, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Postal and Telecommunications Trade Union, said that in order to achieve the basic tasks of the people of the whole country in the next ten to fifteen years, postal and telecommunications workers should adhere to the policy of building the country and running enterprises diligently and thriftily, vigorously develop the postal and telecommunications network, and organize mobile service teams to maximize the needs of China's industrial and agricultural construction and the development of science and culture.
    Zheng Jinghua, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Geological Trade Union, said that striving to catch up with or surpass Britain in steel and other important industrial products in about fifteen years requires geological workers to find more mineral resources for the country. The Geological Trade Union should carry out the rectification movement and the socialist education movement deeply and thoroughly, so that new workers and technicians can be further improved ideologically and politically.
    Wang Chongjiu, Xue Jianmin, Xia Xue, Du Yanqing, and Dou Yougui were among the other representatives who spoke at today's meeting.
    At today's meeting, Diallo Seydou, Secretary-General of the General Confederation of Black African Workers, brought greetings from the Black African workers. He said, "We pay tribute to the great Chinese revolution through this congress. The great Chinese revolution is one of the most important events of this century, and this people's revolution has opened up new prospects for the whole world, especially for colonial and semi-colonial countries." Seydou added that the General Confederation of Black African Workers is the vanguard of the anti-colonialist struggle, and its activities have expanded to the entire Black Africa still under French rule, influencing the political, economic, and social life of the entire Africa. The purpose of the General Confederation is to organize African workers to unite them and to coordinate the actions of all African trade union organizations to fight against colonialism and all forms of human oppression and exploitation, to support their various economic and social demands, to strive for the legal recognition of the personal dignity of African workers, and for the overall liberation of the local ethnic groups. We are full of confidence in the victory of our struggle because we are not alone.
    After Seydou's speech, he presented a banner to the congress. The banner read: "Chinese workers and Black African workers unite in the struggle against colonialism and imperialism!" All the representatives stood up and applauded warmly to express their gratitude.
    The executive chairman of the congress also read a congratulatory message from Mi. Somogyi, Chairman of the National Federation of Free Trade Unions of Hungary, to the congress. Somogyi did not attend today's meeting due to illness. In his congratulatory message, he conveyed the congratulations of the Hungarian people, organized workers, and trade union organizations to the congress. He stated that under the leadership of the Socialist Workers' Party and the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, and with the assistance of the countries of the socialist camp, the Hungarian working class and working people have largely healed the wounds left by the counter-revolution within a year. Hungary's political and economic life is developing more healthily than before the counter-revolutionary riots. Somogyi finally emphasized that the Hungarian trade unions and the Hungarian working class have learned a lesson from the reactionary forces at home and abroad, and the trade union organizations can never deviate from the path pointed out by Marxism-Leninism. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party or the Workers' Party can the trade union organizations avoid deviating from this path. In addition to sending a congratulatory message to the congress, Somogyi also presented a banner to the congress.
    After the speeches and addresses, Dong Xin, representative of the proposal review committee, made a review report on the proposals. In his report, he said that the congress had received a total of 322 proposals. The proposal review committee divided into groups to review the proposals according to their nature. All the proposals were first analyzed and studied by the groups, and preliminary review opinions were put forward. Then, the plenary meeting of the committee carefully reviewed and discussed each case and put forward handling opinions. Dong Xin said that the proposal review committee believed that these proposals reflected the strong desire of the Chinese working class to unite and build the country diligently and thriftily, and put forward positive suggestions for many aspects of China's socialist construction. We suggest that these proposals be handed over to the Eighth Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for handling separately in accordance with the review opinions. Dong Xin also said that 66 letters from employees were also received during the congress. These letters reflected the expectations and trust of the masses of employees in the congress. We suggest that these letters be handed over to the Eighth Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and instructed the relevant departments to handle them carefully. After Dong Xin's report, the representatives unanimously raised their hands to indicate their approval.
    After listening to Gu Dachun, Deputy Secretary-General of the Congress, on the "Methods (Draft) for Electing Executive Committee Members and Alternate Executive Committee Members of the Eighth National Congress of Chinese Trade Unions," the congress unanimously raised their hands to approve the election methods. The list of thirty-one ballot supervisors was also approved. The congress will continue tomorrow.

　　提高工人阶级的共产主义觉悟
    工会代表强调加强政治思想工作
    据新华社11日讯　中国工会第八次全国代表大会在今天下午继续进行大会讨论。
    大会首先由执行主席宣读了各民主党派向大会的贺词。
    在今天大会上发言的各地代表有十一人，他们就进一步加强职工政治思想教育工作、以及努力实现我国今后十五年任务等方面发表了意见。
    何波（云南省工会联合会副主席）代表在发言中说，从目前工人阶级的现状来看，随着社会主义建设事业的发展，大量的非工人阶级成份加入了工人阶级队伍，他们把资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想带进了工人阶级内部来，再加上资产阶级和其他非工人阶级思想经常不断地对工人阶级的侵袭，因此今后工会工作中必须大力加强对职工群众的政治思想工作。
    吴子瑜（四川省工会联合会副主席）代表和夏冰流（江苏省南京市工会联合会主席）代表，在发言中也都提到必须加强对青年工人的政治思想教育工作。吴子瑜说，这几年来四川省增加了几十万新工人，这批工人中，很多人原来是学生、小生产者和农民，他们一般都是青年，有朝气，易接受新事物，但没有经过政治斗争和集体劳动锻炼，这就迫切要求工会组织普遍深入地开展整风和社会主义教育运动，使他们真正具有工人阶级的品德。夏冰流说，教育新工人的方法，应该坚持正面教育、群众自我教育相结合的方法，特别是依靠老工人教育新工人，组织民主辩论（包括大字报），邀请新工人的父母或是他们所信服的人来厂参观，请他们配合教育新工人，这些都是比较有效的方法。
    魏文风（沈阳冶炼厂党委书记）代表在发言中说，正确执行工会工作的根本路线，重要的问题在于加强党对工会工作的领导。他认为企业党组织对工会工作的领导，主要是通过工会组织中的党员来实现；工会工作的中心任务，是开展社会主义竞赛，因此党必须加强对竞赛的领导；党还必须支持工会的群众监督，这样不但可以保证工会监督的正确性和增强工会监督的力量，而且可以把党的监督放在群众监督的基础上，更好地发挥工会作为党联系群众的引带作用。
    代表们在今天的发言中，对中共中央致大会祝词中提出的我国工人阶级和全国人民在今后十年到十五年内的基本任务，继续表示热烈的拥护和支持。中国邮电工会全国委员会主席李景韩说，为了实现全国人民在今后十年到十五年内的基本任务，邮电工人应该坚持勤俭建国、勤俭办企业的方针，大力发展邮电通信网，组织流动服务组，以最大限度地满足我国工农业建设和科学文化事业发展的需要。
    中国地质工会全国委员会主席郑晶华说，争取十五年左右在钢铁和其他重要工业产品方面赶上或超过英国，这就需要地质工作者为国家寻找更多的矿产资源。地质工会应该将整风运动和社会主义教育运动搞深搞透，使新工人和技术人员在思想上政治上得到进一步的提高。
    今天在大会上发言的代表还有王重九、薛建民、夏雪、杜延庆、窦有桂等五人。
    在今天的大会上，黑非总工会总书记狄亚洛·赛依杜带来了黑非工人的问候。他说，我们通过这个代表大会向伟大的中国革命致敬。伟大的中国革命是我们这个世纪中的一件最重大的事情，这个人民革命为全世界、特别是为殖民地和半殖民地国家开辟了新的前途。赛依杜又说，黑非总工会是反殖民主义斗争的先锋队，它的活动已扩大到仍在法国统治下的整个黑非洲，影响到整个非洲的政治、经济和社会生活。总工会的目的在于组织非洲工人使他们团结起来，使所有的非洲工会组织的行动协调一致地展开斗争，反对殖民制度和人压迫人、人剥削人的一切形式，拥护他们在经济和社会方面的各种要求，争取非洲工人的人格尊严得到合法承认，以及本地各族人民的全面解放。我们对我们所进行的斗争的胜利充满信心，因为我们不是孤单的。
    赛依杜致词后向大会献旗，这面锦旗上写着：“中国工人和黑非工人在反殖民主义、反帝的斗争中团结起来！”全体代表起立，热烈鼓掌，表示感谢。
    大会执行主席还宣读了匈牙利自由工会全国联合会主席米·绍莫吉给大会的贺词。绍莫吉因病没有参加今天的大会，他在贺词中转达了匈牙利人民、有组织的工人和工会组织对大会的祝贺。他说，匈牙利工人阶级和劳动人民在社会主义工人党和工农革命政府的领导下，在社会主义阵营各国的援助下，把反革命为我们留下的创伤，在一年之内大部分医治好了。匈牙利的政治和经济生活比反革命暴乱前更加健康地发展着。绍莫吉最后强调，匈牙利的工会、匈牙利的工人阶级已经从国内外反动派那里得到了教训，工会组织永远也不能离开马克思列宁主义指出的道路。只有在共产党或工人党的领导下，工会组织才不致于离开这条道路。绍莫吉除对大会致贺词外，还赠送给大会一面锦旗。
    大会发言和致词以后，董昕代表提案审查委员会作了关于提案的审查报告，他在报告中说，这次大会共收到提案三百二十二件，提案审查委员会根据提案的性质，分组进行了审查，所有提案，先由小组分析研究并提出初步审查意见，再由委员会全体会议详加审查，逐案讨论，提出处理意见。董昕说，提案审查委员会认为，这些提案反映了我国工人阶级团结一致、勤俭建国的强烈愿望，对于我国社会主义建设事业许多方面提出了积极的建议。我们建议，将这些提案交给中华全国总工会第八届执行委员会依照审查意见分别进行处理。董昕还说，大会期间还收到职工来信六十六件。这些来信，反映了职工群众对大会的期望和信任。我们建议，将这些来信交给中华全国总工会第八届执行委员会责成有关部门认真处理。董昕报告以后，代表们一致举手表示通过。
    今天的大会在听了大会副秘书长顾大椿关于“中国工会第八次全国代表大会选举执行委员候补执行委员的办法（草案）”以后，一致举手通过了这个选举办法。并且通过了三十一位监票人名单。大会将在明天继续举行。
