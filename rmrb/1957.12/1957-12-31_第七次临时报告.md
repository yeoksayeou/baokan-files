    Seventh Interim Report
    By a Commentator of this Newspaper
    The International Commission for Vietnam submitted its seventh interim report to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference, outlining the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Vietnam from August 1, 1956, to April 30, 1957.
    If the content and issues covered in this report are similar to the previous six reports, it is that the United States continues to directly, and through its many military advisory groups and agencies, and agents in South Vietnam, engage in activities that undermine the Geneva Accords and obstruct the peaceful reunification of Vietnam. If it differs from the previous six reports, it is that the United States has adopted more blatant, arrogant, and direct military means to prepare for a new military adventure in Vietnam, leading to a large-scale illegal entry of up to two hundred people, including Americans, into the demilitarized zone and even advancing to the military demarcation line. It is also noted that, despite the legitimate inquiries of the International Commission, many U.S. military advisory groups are still operating in South Vietnam without the inspection and supervision of the International Commission. Even the South Vietnamese authorities have so far failed to respond to the questions raised by the International Commission. U.S. military aircraft can even refuse inspection by the commission team under the pretext of being "U.S. Embassy" aircraft. Newly built airports are not allowed to be viewed by the commission, and even the absurd excuse of "this is a military airport" is used to refuse the commission's supervision. All of this cannot but make people realize that the International Commission's conclusion in the report that it will "continue to maintain and strengthen the peace of Vietnam on the basis of implementing the Geneva Accords" is very correct. Regarding the United States' serious acts of undermining the Geneva Accords and threatening the peace of Vietnam, as well as the South Vietnamese authorities' refusal to implement the Geneva Accords, the countries participating in the Geneva Conference should, as the report requests, take appropriate steps to safeguard the Geneva Accords and promote the peaceful reunification of Vietnam.

    第七次临时报告
    本报评论员
    越南国际委员会向日内瓦会议两位主席提出了第七次临时报告，概述了自1956年8月1日起至1957年4月30日止日内瓦协议在越南的实施情况。
    如果说这个报告的内容和所涉及的问题与前六次报告有相同的地方的话，那就是美国继续直接地和通过它在南越的许多军事顾问团和代理机构、代理人物在南越进行破坏日内瓦协议，阻挠越南的和平统一的活动。如果说它与前六次报告有所不同的话，那就是美国采取了更露骨、更嚣张和更直接的军事手段来准备在越南发动一次新的军事冒险，以致发生包括美国人在内的人数达二百人的大规模非法进入非军事区并且一直进犯到军事分界线的事件。人们也注意到：不顾国际委员会的正当的查问，美国的许多军事顾问团竟然仍在南越活动而不受国际委员会的监察和监督。甚至南越当局至今对于国际委员会所提的问题置不作复。美国军用飞机竟然可以借口是“美国大使馆”的飞机而拒绝让委员会小组视察。新建的机场不让委员会去看，甚至还用什么“此系军用机场”的荒谬借口来拒绝委员会的监督。所有这一切不能不使人们认识到：国际委员会在报告结论中指出它将“继续在实施日内瓦协议的基础上维持和加强越南的和平”，是非常正确的。对于美国这种严重的破坏日内瓦协议和威胁越南和平的冒险行为以及南越当局拒不履行日内瓦协议的行为，日内瓦会议与会各国，应该如报告所要求的，采取适当的步骤，以便维护日内瓦协议和促进越南的和平统一。
