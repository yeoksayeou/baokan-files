Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Henan Province had, by November 15th, overfulfilled its planned grain procurement target by 1.6%, an increase of over 22% compared to the same period last year. The plan was completed more than two months earlier than in previous years.

This year, Henan Province suffered from severe water and drought disasters in many areas, and the province's grain crop output is estimated to be 1.2 billion jin less than last year. In order to ensure the food supply for urban and rural people lacking grain, the Party and government leaders of Henan Province, at the beginning of the autumn grain procurement work, actively corrected the regulations that had been overly lenient in allowing grain retention under the summer grain unified sales policy, based on the fundamental guideline that the growth of people's living consumption cannot exceed the rate of production development, and still calculated purchases and sales according to the "Three Fixes" policy. Party organizations at all levels successively convened more than 100,000 cadre meetings, using the spirit of rectification to conscientiously examine and criticize the departmentalism and right-leaning sentiments of some cadres on the grain issue, and closely combined this with the current socialist education movement in rural areas, mobilizing peasants to conduct in-depth and extensive debates on issues such as the grain policy of "using abundance to compensate for scarcity" and the unified grain sales policy, thereby greatly enhancing the patriotic grain-selling consciousness of the broad masses of peasants. Many agricultural cooperatives voluntarily reported past under-reporting of production.

　　河南粮食征购任务超额完成
    据新华社讯　河南省到11月15日，超额1.6％完成了粮食征购预定计划，比去年同期增加了22％强。完成计划时间比往年提前两个多月。
    今年河南省由于许多地区遭到严重的水旱灾害，全省粮食作物产量预计比去年减产十二亿斤。为保证城乡缺粮人民的食粮供应，河南省的党政领导在秋季粮食征购工作开始，根据人民生活消费的增长不能超过生产发展速度的基本指针，主动纠正了在夏季粮食统销政策上各项粮食留量偏宽的规定，仍然按照“三定”政策计算购销。各级中共组织都相继召开了共计十多万人次的干部会，运用整风精神，认真检查和批判了一部分干部在粮食问题上的本位主义和右倾情绪，并且密切结合当前农村的社会主义教育运动，发动农民对“以丰补歉”的粮食方针和粮食统销政策等问题，展开了深入、广泛的辩论，从而大大提高了广大农民的爱国售粮觉悟。许多农业社自动报出了过去少报的产量。
