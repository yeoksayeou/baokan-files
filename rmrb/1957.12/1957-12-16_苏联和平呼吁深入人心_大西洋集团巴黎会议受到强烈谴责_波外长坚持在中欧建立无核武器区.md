Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The peace proposals recently put forward by the Soviet government are increasingly striking deep root in people's hearts, and governments and media in many countries have expressed their support. On the other hand, the plot of the United States and Britain to promote a new arms race policy through the Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Group has been strongly condemned.

    Warsaw dispatch: Polish Foreign Minister Rapacki delivered a speech at a meeting of the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee on the 13th.

    When discussing the international situation, he pointed out that the facts prove that activists in the Atlantic Treaty countries are trying to intensify the expansion of armaments, primarily rocket weapons, and want to deploy these weapons within West German territory.

    Rapacki, in discussing the danger of the arms race, pointed out that equipping the West German army with nuclear weapons is a serious threat to Poland, Europe, and the entire world.

    He said that Poland regards striving to ease international tensions and developing peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems as one of the most important tasks in its policy. This policy prompted us to propose the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. Further efforts must be made to seek a program for a mutually acceptable agreement. The proposals put forward by Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, in his letters are such an attempt. There is no doubt that adopting these proposals as a joint step by the major powers would have great moral significance.

    Sofia dispatch: The Bulgarian government issued a statement regarding the upcoming Paris summit of the North Atlantic Group, saying that the preparations for the meeting and some of the issues to be discussed on the agenda show that this meeting is not for consolidating peace and improving international relations, but for preparing for a new war.

    Referring to the letters from Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, to the leaders of Western countries, the statement pointed out: The Bulgarian government fully supports these proposals of the Soviet government and believes that if the interests of peace are concerned, these proposals should not be rejected.

    The statement went on to point out that, given that two of Bulgaria's neighbors—Turkey and Greece—are members of the North Atlantic Treaty, and that according to the published agenda of the Paris meeting, missile bases and missile and nuclear weapon depots may be established on their territory according to the decisions of the meeting, the Bulgarian government has reason to believe that these are direct infringements on Bulgaria's interests.

    The Bulgarian government believes that the proposal put forward by Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Romania, Stoica, regarding holding a meeting of leaders of Balkan countries is the only correct way to resolve disputes between Balkan countries.

    Berlin dispatch: According to a report by the German News Agency, the National Council of the National Front of Democratic Germany issued a statement on the 12th, calling on all German patriots and committees at all levels of the National Front to vigorously publicize the contents of the Moscow Peace Declaration, the recent Soviet peace proposals, and the proposals submitted by the People's Chamber to the West German Federal Assembly, so that everyone knows them.

    The statement said that the National Council of the National Front expresses its support for those workers, peasants, intellectuals, democratic groups, and all responsible people in West Germany who favor establishing a "nuclear-weapon-free zone" in Europe and withdrawing foreign troops from Germany and European countries. The statement emphasized that "the movement for peace must become a broad and powerful people's movement throughout Germany."

    Belgrade dispatch: The spokesman for the Yugoslav State Secretariat for Foreign Affairs, Draskovic, said at a press conference held on the 13th that the Yugoslav government is studying the letters from the Soviet government to the leaders of Western countries with great interest. He said that it can already be said that we believe that these measures by the Soviet government provide new possibilities for the views of relevant governments in the East and West to converge on many major international issues.

    New Delhi dispatch: The reply of Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, to Indian Prime Minister Nehru has been welcomed by Indian public opinion and political figures. Indian people are now waiting to see how the U.S. government responds to Nehru's appeal.

    The "National Herald" said that Bulganin's proposals to Western countries are an "effort to explore agreement." The "New India Times" said that "the Soviet proposals are just and can win the sympathy of peace-loving people all over the world." The "Hindustan Times" pointed out on the 15th that the Soviet Union's recent proposal to stop nuclear tests starting from January 1 should be accepted by Western countries. The newspaper believes that further proposals regarding an agreement between the United States, Britain, and Russia not to deploy nuclear weapons in East and West Germany have immediate urgency at present.

    A recent issue of the "Delhi Times" weekly said that Indian political figures believe that the upcoming meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council is clearly intended to cheer up the West after the great achievements of Russian scientists in launching earth satellites. This weekly revealed in a dispatch the plan of this meeting to strengthen the relationship between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the Baghdad Pact; it said that this plan seriously threatens the security of India and other Asian countries.

    Cairo dispatch: Egyptian newspapers all published the letters from Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, to the heads of government of the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany on the front page, pointing out that these documents are of great significance to the cause of peace and maintaining universal security. The newspapers emphasized that on the eve of the upcoming meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council, the Soviet Union once again called on Western countries to abandon the policy of arms race and follow the path of peaceful coexistence.

    The "Al-Akhbar" published an editorial pointing out: "Bulganin proposed reaching a peace agreement, while the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are preparing to meet to discuss the preparations for war." This policy of the West can only aggravate the "Cold War" and sharpen tensions.

    "Al-Gomhuria" wrote that Bulganin's letter pointed out: "The upcoming meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council pursues the goal of further arms race and poses a threat to universal security."

　　苏联和平呼吁深入人心
    大西洋集团巴黎会议受到强烈谴责
    波外长坚持在中欧建立无核武器区
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：苏联政府最近提出的和平建议，愈来愈深入人心，许多国家的政府和舆论界纷纷表示支持。另一方面，美英两国企图通过北大西洋集团巴黎会议推行新的备战政策的阴谋，则遭到强烈的谴责。
    华沙消息：波兰外交部长拉帕茨基13日在议会外交委员会会议上发表了演说。
    在论述国际局势的时候，他指出，事实证明大西洋公约国家的活动家力图加紧扩充军备，首先是火箭武器，想把这种武器配置在西德境内。
    拉帕茨基谈到军备竞赛的危险性时指出，以核武器装备西德军队对波兰、欧洲以及全世界是一个严重的威胁。
    他说，波兰把努力缓和国际紧张局势和开展不同社会制度的国家的和平共处看成是自己政策中最重要的任务之一。这一政策促使我们提出在中欧建立无原子武器地区的建议。必须为寻求一个双方都能接受的协议的纲领作进一步努力。苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁在信中所提出的建议就是这样一种尝试。毫无疑问，采纳这些建议作为大国的共同步骤，将具有重大的道义上的意义。
    索非亚消息：保加利亚政府就即将举行的北大西洋集团首脑巴黎会议发表声明说，会议的准备工作和会议日程上所要讨论的一些问题说明，这次会议不是为了巩固和平和改善国际关系，而是准备新战争。
    在谈到苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁给西方国家领导人的信时，声明指出：保加利亚政府全力支持苏联政府的这些建议，认为如果关心和平利益的话，就不应该拒绝这些建议。
    声明接着指出，鉴于保加利亚的两个邻国——土耳其和希腊都是北大西洋公约的成员国，而根据已经公布的巴黎会议的议程，又可能根据会议的决议而在它们的领土上建立导弹基地以及导弹和核武器仓库，保加利亚政府有理由认为这些是直接侵害保加利亚的利益的。
    保加利亚政府认为罗马尼亚部长会议主席斯托伊卡提出的关于举行巴尔干各国领导人会议的建议是解决巴尔干国家彼此间争端的唯一正确的途径。
    柏林消息：据德意志通讯社报道，民主德国全国阵线全国委员会在12日发表一项声明，号召全德国爱国人士和全国阵线的各级委员会大力宣传莫斯科和平宣言、苏联最近的和平建议和人民议院向西德联邦议院所提的建议的内容，要做到家喻户晓。
    声明说，全国阵线全国委员会对那些赞成在欧洲建立“无原子武器区”和赞成从德国和欧洲国家撤退外国军队的工人、农民、知识分子、民主团体以及西德一切有责任感的人士表示支持。声明强调说，“争取和平的运动必须成为全德广泛而有力的人民运动”。
    贝尔格莱德消息：南斯拉夫外交国务秘书处发言人德拉什科维奇在13日举行的记者招待会上说，南斯拉夫政府正在很感兴趣地研究苏联政府给西方国家领导人的信。他说，现在已经可以说，我们认为，苏联政府的这些措施提供了新的可能，使东西方有关各国政府在许多重大国际问题上的观点得到接近。
    新德里消息：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁给印度总理尼赫鲁的答复受到印度的舆论和政界人士的欢迎。印度人士现在正在等待看美国政府如何答复尼赫鲁的呼吁。
    “国民先驱报”说，布尔加宁向西方国家的建议是一种“探求协议的努力”。“新印度时报”说，“苏联的建议是公正的，它能够博得全世界爱好和平的人的同情”。“印度斯坦时报”15日指出，苏联最近提出的从1月1日开始停止核试验的建议应该为西方国家所接受。这家报纸认为，关于美国、英国和俄国协议不在东西德设置核武器的进一步建议目前具有直接的紧急意义。
    最近一期“德里时代”周刊说，印度政界人士认为，将要举行的北大西洋公约组织理事会会议明显地是在俄国科学家发射地球卫星取得巨大成就后想为西方打气。这家周刊在电讯中揭露这个会议要加强北大西洋公约组织和东南亚条约组织以及巴格达条约之间的关系的计划；它说，这个计划严重地威胁了印度和其他亚洲国家的安全。
    开罗消息：埃及各报都在第一版登载了苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁给美、英、法和西德政府首脑的信件，指出这些文件对和平事业和维护普遍安全具有极大的意义。报纸强调指出，在北大西洋公约组织理事会即将开会的前夕，苏联再一次地呼吁西方国家放弃备战政策，走和平共处的道路。
    “消息报”发表社论指出：“布尔加宁建议达成和平协议，而北大西洋公约组织各国却准备开会讨论战争的准备问题”。西方的这种政策只能加剧“冷战”，并且使紧张局势尖锐化。
    “共和国报”写道，布尔加宁的信中指出：“即将举行的北大西洋公约组织理事会会议追求进一步进行军备竞赛的目的，并且给普遍安全带来威胁”。
