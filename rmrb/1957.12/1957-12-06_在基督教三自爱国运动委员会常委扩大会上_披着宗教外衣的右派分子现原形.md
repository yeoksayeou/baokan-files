Xinhua News Agency, December 5th. At the tenth enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of the Protestant Churches in China, the anti-Communist and anti-socialist words and deeds of Liu Lingjiu, Zhou Qingze, Dong Hongen, Fan Aishi, and Zhou Fuqing, rightists in the Christian community who were wearing religious cloaks, were fully exposed and criticized.

　　Rightist Liu Lingjiu was the editor of the Christian publication "Tianjia" bi-monthly. During the period of great airing of views, Liu Lingjiu slandered the democratic life of socialist society, falsely claiming that after liberation, "the Communist Party was afraid of people speaking," turning the people of the whole country into "yes-men" and "slaves." Liu Lingjiu clamored wildly for the "rehabilitation" of counter-revolutionaries in the Christian community.

　　"Tianjia" bi-monthly was mainly aimed at rural Christians. Liu Lingjiu used "Tianjia" to openly spread the slander that the national "agricultural cooperatives were not run well and production decreased," defaming agricultural cooperative members as enduring painful forced labor, even saying that "peasants would rather starve to death than be exhausted to death." He also published a large number of fallacies slandering the state's religious policy in "Tianjia," inciting believers to oppose the Communist Party and the People's Government. This publication once had a very bad influence among rural believers.

　　At a symposium held by the Xiamen Municipal Religious Affairs Office during the period of great airing of views in May this year, Zhou Qingze, a pastor of the Gulangyu Church of the Chinese Christian Church, spread many malicious fallacies. Zhou Qingze publicly blustered that the main contradiction among the people today is that the people want to live but cannot live, and the people demand more freedom but cannot get it. He also spread rumors that the lives of the people across the country have become so difficult that they are eating "sand as rice," and that "80% of the farmers across the country are complaining." Zhou Qingze also fabricated lies to slander the Three-Self Patriotic Movement as a complete mess, describing this anti-imperialist patriotic movement that was enthusiastically supported by the broad masses of believers as "extremely detrimental to the religious life of the church," attempting to use religion to incite the broad masses of believers to make trouble.

　　The meeting also revealed that Dong Hongen, pastor of the Shanghai Church of the China Gospel Mission, is still colluding with imperialist elements in Hong Kong. During the period of great airing of views, Dong Hongen went everywhere to cry "injustice" for counter-revolutionaries and bad elements within Christianity. He used various opportunities to distort facts, attack religious policies, and slander religious activities as being interfered with, attempting to incite the masses of believers to oppose the Communist Party. Among the believers, Dong Hongen has consistently emphasized the fallacy that loving the church means not loving the country, poisoning young believers and hindering them from participating in the socialist construction of the motherland.

　　Another rightist revealed at the meeting, Fan Aishi, has consistently used the opportunity of preaching to spread a large number of anti-Soviet and anti-Communist fallacies since liberation. Fan Aishi is the chairman of the Ningbo Diocese of the Chinese Christian Methodist Episcopal Church. During the period of great airing of views in July this year, he viciously asked the Communist Party to "give way," saying: "If there are other political parties that are more mature than the Communist Party, the Communist Party should give way to them." Fan Aishi, who has consistently opposed the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, also openly promoted that "preachers have done too much to love the country, and have done less to love the church," intentionally pitting the patriotic obligations that every citizen must bear against personal religious beliefs, in order to spread reactionary poison and deceive believers.

　　Zhou Fuqing, an elder of the Shanghai Lingliang Church who is also a member of the Shanghai Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference, openly slandered the CPPCC anti-rightist symposium as a "set-up" by the Communist Party, "just like an American voting machine." At a symposium held by the religious group of the Shanghai CPPCC in March this year, he openly slandered the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, saying that the government was "using the suppression of counter-revolutionaries to eliminate religion." Regarding the Three-Self Patriotic Movement, which aims at anti-imperialism and patriotism, on the eve of the National Conference of the Protestant Churches in China in 1954, Zhou Fuqing gathered a group of reactionary and backward elements in the church in Shanghai several times to plot and sabotage it.

　　In order to achieve their evil goals of destroying the Communist Party and socialism, and in order to cover up their ugly faces, these rightists have put on religious cloaks, waved the banner of "for the sake of faith" and "for the sake of the church," and described their evil activities as being due to "sincere faith" and "love for the church," and consciously spread reactionary fallacies such as "to love the church means not to love the country" and "to be sincerely faithful means not to pursue political progress" among the broad masses of believers, openly slandering the religious policy of the People's Government, in order to win over some backward believers and promote their anti-Communist and anti-socialist conspiracies.

　　The materials revealed at the meeting also fully proved that these rightists had consistently been loyal to imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang before liberation, and after liberation, they were unwilling to sever their ties with imperialist elements. They harbored and concealed counter-revolutionaries and various criminal offenders, and were determined to be enemies of the people. Fan Aishi, who had colluded with imperialist elements as early as 1938, helped imperialist element Bi Fanyu to Ningbo twice before liberation in 1948 and 1949 to preach the so-called "Ten Sins of the Communist Party" and discuss the church's "contingency matters." When Chiang Kai-shek "retired" to Xikou, Zhejiang in January 1949, Fan Aishi went to Xikou three times to "preach" to Chiang, and the first topic was "Go Forward," encouraging this executioner to continue to pick up the butcher knife and suppress the people. After liberation, Fan Aishi persisted in his reactionary position and successively harbored counter-revolutionaries, fugitive landlords, and criminal offenders who undermined state finances in his home and in the church. He also formed close friendships with these people. Dong Hongen, who had planned to go to the United States to rely on imperialist elements before liberation in 1949 but failed, not only "regretted it very much" until now, but also recently planned to flee the country and go to imperialist elements.

　　In the seven-day meeting where these rightists were exposed and criticized, more than 100 people stood up to reason and fight against the rightists. Some people who did not speak at the meeting due to time constraints also wrote written speeches. Everyone who spoke at the meeting unanimously pointed out that all patriotic believers in the Christian community must draw a clear line with these rightists, continue to carry out the anti-imperialist patriotic movement, support the leadership of the Communist Party, and resolutely follow the socialist road together with the people of the whole country.

　　Bishop Chen Jianzhen, chairman of the Chinese Anglican Church, pointed out after exposing Fan Aishi's reactionary words and deeds that the reason why the rightists in the Christian community want to carry out anti-Communist and anti-socialist conspiracies under the guise of "for the sake of faith" and "for the sake of the church" is to cover up their attempt to restore imperialist control over the Chinese church. They hate socialism and the Communist Party to the bone. It is definitely not a matter of personal faith for Christians, but their insistence on a reactionary political stance and their refusal to repent.

　　Wu Yifang, Vice Governor of Jiangsu Province and Vice Chairman of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of the Protestant Churches in China, used her own personal experience in her speech, and cited the fact that both the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels have representatives from the religious community to participate, illustrating the respect and trust of the Communist Party and the People's Government for patriotic believers, and sternly refuted the slander that the Communist Party and the People's Government want to eliminate religion. Wu Yifang used many facts that she personally experienced in the United States to refute the rightists' fallacy that China has no democracy and freedom, and exposed the essence of so-called bourgeois democracy and freedom.

　　Tu Yuqing, General Secretary of the National Association of the YMCA of China, said at the meeting that the Communist Party led the Chinese people to gain liberation, so that our church is no longer an tool of imperialist aggression, and also enables us to truly be upright and patriotic believers, fulfill the obligations that a citizen should fulfill, and build socialism together with the people of the whole country. The broad masses of patriotic believers wholeheartedly support the leadership of the Communist Party.

　　Dozens of representatives from the Christian community from 25 provinces and cities including Shanghai, Nanjing, Henan, and Shandong also listed the various facts they had personally seen about the ever-improving lives of urban and rural people and the people's love for the Communist Party, as well as the correct implementation of religious policies in various places, refuting the rightists' fallacies that the people "can no longer live" and slandering religious policies.

　　After fierce debate, these rightists were at a loss for words, and they were in a completely isolated position at the meeting.

### 在基督教三自爱国运动委员会常委扩大会上　披着宗教外衣的右派分子现原形

　　在基督教三自爱国运动委员会常委扩大会上
　　披着宗教外衣的右派分子现原形
    据新华社5日讯　披着宗教外衣的基督教界右派分子刘龄九、周清泽、董鸿恩、范爱侍和周福庆，他们的反共反社会主义言行已在中国基督教三自爱国运动委员会第十次常委扩大会议上被充分地揭露和批判。
    右派分子刘龄九是基督教刊物“田家”半月刊的主编。在大鸣大放期间，刘龄九曾经诬蔑社会主义社会的民主生活，诽谤说解放后“共产党怕人说话”，已使全国人民变成“唯唯诺诺”的“奴隶”。刘龄九猖狂地叫嚣要为基督教界的反革命分子“平反”。
  “田家”半月刊的主要读者对象是农村基督教徒，刘龄九利用“田家”公开散布所谓全国“农业合作社没有办好，减了产”的谰言，诽谤农业社员经受着痛苦的强迫劳动，竟说“农民宁愿饿死而不愿累死”。他还在“田家”上刊登大量诬蔑国家宗教政策的谬论，煽动教徒起来反对共产党和人民政府。这个刊物一度在农村教徒中起了很恶劣的影响。
    在今年5月鸣放期间厦门市宗教事务处召开的座谈会上，中华基督教会鼓浪屿堂会牧师周清泽，曾经散布了许多恶毒的谬论。周清泽曾经公然胡说什么今天人民内部的主要矛盾是人民要生活下去而却活不下去，人民要求自由一些而却得不到自由。他还造谣说全国人民的生活已困难到“沙当米吃”的程度，“全国80％的农民都在埋怨”。周清泽还无中生有地诬蔑三自爱国运动搞得一团糟，把这个广大教徒热烈拥护的反帝爱国运动说成是“极有损于教会的宗教生活”，企图利用宗教煽动广大教徒起来闹事。
    会上还揭露了中国布道会上海教会基督徒会堂牧师董鸿恩，他至今仍与在香港的帝国主义分子勾搭。大鸣大放期间，董鸿恩到处为基督教内的反革命分子和坏分子喊“冤”。并利用各种机会，歪曲事实，攻击宗教政策，诬蔑宗教活动受到干涉，企图煽动教徒群众反对共产党。在教徒中，董鸿恩一贯强调爱教就不能爱国的谰言，毒害青年教徒，阻挠他们参加祖国社会主义建设。
    会上揭露的另一个右派分子范爱侍，解放后一贯利用讲道的机会大量散布反苏反共谬论。范爱侍是中华基督教循道公会宁波教区主席，在今年7月的鸣放期间他恶毒地要共产党“让位”，他说：“如果有其他政党比共产党更成熟，共产党就应当要让它”。一贯反对三自爱国运动的范爱侍，还公开宣传“传道人爱国的事情做多了，爱教的事情就少做了”，有意把每个公民必须承担的爱国义务和个人的宗教信仰对立起来，以散布反动的毒素，蒙蔽教徒。
    身为上海市政协委员的上海灵粮堂长老周福庆，在这次会议上竟公开诬蔑政治协商会议反右派座谈会是共产党“布置一套”，“简直像美国表决机器一样”。在今年3月上海政协宗教组召开的座谈会上，他公然诽谤肃反运动说，政府是“借肃反来消灭宗教”。对于以反帝爱国为宗旨的三自爱国运动，在1954年中国基督教全国会议的前夕，周福庆就曾在上海纠集一批教会中的反动分子和落后分子几次密谋，进行破坏。
    这些右派分子为了达到他们搞垮共产党和社会主义的罪恶目的，并且为了掩盖他们的丑恶面目，都曾经披起宗教的外衣，打着“为了信仰”、“为了教会”的幌子，把他们的罪恶活动说成是由于“信仰虔诚”和“热爱教会”，并且有意识地在广大教徒中散布“要爱教就不能爱国”，“为了信仰虔诚就不能追求政治上进步”等反动谬论，公开诬蔑人民政府的宗教政策，以便拉拢某些落后教徒，为他们的反共反社会主义的阴谋活动张目。
    这次会上揭露的材料，还充分证明了这些右派分子在解放前就一贯效忠帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮，解放后他们不愿割断同帝国主义分子的联系，他们包庇和窝藏反革命分子和各种刑事犯罪分子，一心与人民为敌。早在1938年就同帝国主义分子相勾结的范爱侍，在1948年和1949年的解放前夕，就曾经帮助帝国主义分子毕范宇两次到宁波，宣讲什么“共产党十大罪状”，并商谈教会的“应变事宜”。1949年1月蒋介石“引退”浙江溪口时，范爱侍三次去溪口给蒋贼“讲道”，第一篇讲题是“往前走”，鼓励这个刽子手继续拿起屠刀镇压人民。解放后，范爱侍坚持反动立场，先后在他家里以及利用教堂窝藏过反革命分子、逃亡地主和破坏国家金融的刑事犯罪分子多人。并同这些人结成密友。在1949年解放前夕就曾打算到美国依附帝国主义分子而未能成行的董鸿恩，不仅至今对此还“十分惋惜”，并且最近还曾打算逃出国境去投靠帝国主义分子。
    在集中揭露和批判这些右派分子的七天大会发言中，站起来和右派分子进行说理斗争的共有一百多人。有些因为时间限制而没有在会上发言的，还写了书面发言。在会上发言的人都一致指出，基督教界的所有爱国教徒都必须和这些右派分子划清界限，继续开展反帝爱国运动，拥护共产党的领导，坚决和全国人民一起走社会主义的道路。
    中华圣公会主席主教陈见真在揭发了范爱侍的反动言行后指出，基督教界的右派分子其所以要打着
  “为了信仰”、“为了教会”的幌子进行反共反社会主义的阴谋活动，其目的是要掩盖他们恢复帝国主义对中国教会的控制的企图。他们对社会主义和共产党恨之入骨，绝对不是什么基督教徒的个人信仰问题，而是他们坚持反动的政治立场，硬不悔悟。
    现任江苏省副省长的中国基督教三自爱国运动委员会副主席吴贻芳，在发言中以她自己的亲身经历，并举出全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会都有宗教界代表参加的事实，说明了共产党和人民政府对爱国教徒的尊重和信任，严正地驳斥了所谓共产党与人民政府要消灭宗教的谰言。吴贻芳以许多她在美国亲身经历的事实，驳斥了右派分子诬蔑中国没有民主和自由的谬论，揭露了所谓资产阶级民主自由的实质。
    基督教青年会全国协会总干事涂羽卿在会上说，共产党领导中国人民获得解放，使我们的教会不再成为帝国主义的侵略工具，也使我们能够真正地做一个正直的爱国的信徒，尽一个公民应尽的义务，和全国人民一道建设社会主义。广大爱国教徒都衷心拥护共产党的领导。
    来自上海、南京、河南、山东等二十五个省市的几十位基督教界代表人士，在会上还列举了他们亲眼看到的城乡人民生活日益改善和人民热爱共产党的种种事实，以及各地正确执行宗教政策的情况，驳斥了右派分子说人民“已生活不下去”和诬蔑宗教政策的各种谬论。
    经过激烈的辩论，这些右派分子理屈词穷，他们在会上陷于完全孤立的地位。
