Xinhua News Agency, 30th. National industrial enterprises have exceeded this year's production plan by more than 4%. According to the State Economic Commission, the total national industrial output value this year (excluding the output value of handicrafts) reached 62.8 billion yuan, an increase of 6.9% compared with 1956, exceeding the 1957 target stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan by more than 17%.

The actual situation of national industrial production this year is much better than estimated when the plan was drawn up at the beginning of the year. At the beginning of the year, it was estimated that the growth rate of China's industry in 1956 was 31%, which was the fastest growth rate of China's industry in recent years. At the same time, the poor harvest in agriculture in 1956 affected the supply of raw materials for light industry, and the imbalance in some sectors of the national economy needed to be adjusted, and the scale of capital construction was appropriately reduced. The original plan for the total national industrial output value this year was only 4.5% higher than last year. However, due to the conscientious implementation of the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on carrying out the increase production and practice economy movement and building the country diligently and thriftily by all industrial departments and localities, and due to the major victories of the rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle, which greatly encouraged the enthusiasm and creativity of the national workers in production, the implementation of the plan was much better than estimated at the beginning of the year.

The production plans for most of the 192 major industrial products included in this year's national plan have been completed or overfulfilled. The means of production industry increased by 11.9% compared with last year; the consumer goods industry increased by 2.2%.

Compared with 1956, the increase in the output of various major industrial products this year is as follows: raw coal increased by more than 18 million tons, power generation by more than 2.4 billion kilowatt-hours, crude oil by more than 280,000 tons, pig iron by more than 1.07 million tons, steel by more than 770,000 tons, nitrogen fertilizer by more than 90,000 tons, cement by more than 290,000 tons, timber by more than 5.18 million cubic meters, metal cutting machine tools by more than 3,100 units, AC motors by more than 300,000 kilowatts, radios by more than 170,000, rubber shoes by more than 43 million pairs, paper by more than 160,000 tons, sugar by more than 40,000 tons, bicycles by more than 140,000, fine spun woolen fabrics by more than 1.68 million meters, and cigarettes by more than 410,000 cases.

The biggest feature of this year's industrial production is that many departments have done a better job in increasing production and practicing economy than in previous years, which played a decisive role in overcoming the difficulty of insufficient raw materials at the beginning of the year and overfulfilling the 1957 plan. In particular, in terms of saving and substituting raw materials, improving production technology, and improving enterprise management, all industrial departments and localities have done a lot of work and gained a lot of experience. This year, due to the reduction in cotton consumption per yarn, yarn consumption per cloth, and pulp consumption per ton of machine-made paper, the raw materials saved throughout the year are roughly equivalent to an increase of 100 million meters of cotton cloth and more than 50,000 tons of paper. In order to overcome the difficulty of insufficient copper, the Ministry of Electrical Machinery Industry produced 7,000 tons of aluminum conductors this year, replacing 14,000 tons of copper conductors.

As a result of increasing production and practicing economy, the cost of industrial products of the twelve central industrial ministries (excluding the Ministry of Forestry Industry) in 1957 was reduced by about 4.1% compared with 1956.

In this year, various industrial departments also trial-produced a large number of new products. Among the more important new products are: multi-purpose An-2 civil aircraft, three-wheeled automobiles, 40,500 kVA 154 kV giant power transformers, VT-601 combined machine tools, M-2017 automatic centerless internal grinders, 140-ton bridge foundry cranes, thin steel plates for automobiles, medium plates, cold-drawn steel pipes for the aviation industry, alloy steel plates, etc.

Due to the overfulfillment of this year's production plan, China's industrial enterprises have now initially overcome the difficulty of insufficient raw materials. The situation of certain imbalances that originally appeared in various industrial departments has also been basically adjusted. (Attached picture)

### 今年全国工业总产值：  六百二十八亿元  超额4％以上完成了生产计划

    今年全国工业总产值：
    六百二十八亿元
    超额4％以上完成了生产计划
    新华社30日讯　全国工业企业已经超额4％以上完成了今年的生产计划。据国家经济委员会预计，今年全国工业的总产值（不包括手工业产值）达到了六百二十八亿元，比1956年增长6.9％，超过了第一个五年计划规定1957年指标的17％以上。
    今年全国工业生产的实际情况比年初编制计划时估计的情况要好得多。年初时估计到：1956年我国工业的增长速度是31％，这是近年来我国工业增长速度最快的一年。同时，1956年农业歉收，影响到轻工业原料的供应，加上国民经济某些部门出现的不平衡状况需要加以调整、基本建设规模适当缩小等原因，今年全国工业总产值原来计划只比去年增长4.5％。但是，由于各个工业部门和各个地方认真执行了中共中央和国务院关于开展增产节约运动和勤俭建国的指示，由于整风运动和反右派斗争的重大胜利，大大鼓舞了全国职工生产的积极性和创造性，结果，计划执行情况比年初估计的好得多。
    列入今年国家计划的一百九十二种主要工业产品的生产计划，绝大部分都完成或超额完成了。生产资料工业比去年增长11.9％；消费资料工业增长了2.2％。
    同1956年比较，今年各种主要工业产品增产数字如下：原煤增产一千八百多万吨，发电量二十四亿多度，原油二十八万多吨，生铁一百零七万多吨，钢七十七万多吨，氮肥九万多吨，水泥二十九万多吨，木材五百一十八万多立方公尺，金属切削机床三千一百多台，交流电动机三十多万瓩，收音机十七万多架，胶鞋四千三百多万双，纸十六万多吨，糖四万多吨，自行车十四万多辆，精纺毛织品一百六十八万多公尺，卷烟四十一万多箱。
    今年工业生产最大的特点是许多部门增产节约比历年搞得都好，这对克服年初原材料不足的困难和超额完成1957年计划起了决定性的作用。特别是在节约和代用原材料，提高生产技术，改进企业管理等方面，各个工业部门和各个地方都做了许多工作，并取得了很多经验。今年由于每件纱的用棉量、每匹布的用纱量和每吨机制纸的用浆量的降低，全年节约的原料大约等于增产了一亿公尺的棉布和五万多吨纸。为了克服铜料不足的困难，电机制造工业部今年生产了铝导体七千吨，代替了铜导体一万四千吨。
    由于增产节约的结果，1957年中央十二个工业部（不包括森林工业部）的工业产品的成本，约比1956年降低了4.1％。
    在这一年中，各个工业部门还试制成功了大量新产品。其中比较重要的新产品有：多种用途的安二型民用飞机、三轮汽车、四○五○○千伏安一五四千伏巨型电力变压器、VT六○一型组合机床、M二○一七型自动无心内圆磨床、一四○吨桥式铸造起重机、汽车用薄钢板、中板和航空工业用冷拔钢管、合金钢板等。
    由于今年生产计划超额完成，现在我国工业企业已经初步克服了原材料不足的困难。原来各个工业部门中出现的某些比例失调的情况，也基本上调整过来了。（附图片）
