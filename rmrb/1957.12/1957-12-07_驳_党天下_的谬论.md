Refuting the Fallacy of "The Party's World"
　　Sun Dingguo

    It is only natural that Chu Anping, in order to oppose the socialist system, opposes the dictatorship of the proletariat, and in order to oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat, goes a step further to oppose the leadership of the Party.

    Comrade Liu Shaoqi said at the Eighth National Congress of the Party: "In the socialist cause of our country, it is impossible to do without the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the dictatorship of the proletariat is realized through the leadership of the proletarian party—the Communist Party. The strength of the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party lies in its ideological weapon of Marxism-Leninism, its correct political and organizational lines, its rich experience in struggle and work, and its ability to concentrate the wisdom of the people of the whole country and express this wisdom as unified will and disciplined action. Not only in the past, but also in the future, in order to ensure that our country can effectively handle complex domestic and international affairs, it is necessary to have the leadership of such a party. This is jointly recognized by people of all strata of the country and all democratic parties based on actual life." It seems that Chu Anping is very dissatisfied with this point, and he is frantically attacking this point. Of course, from Chu Anping's class instinct, he can understand that with the leadership of the Communist Party, there is no way to bring down the dictatorship of the proletariat. To bring down the dictatorship of the proletariat, one must first attack and even abolish the leadership of the Communist Party. This is the essence of the problem. Therefore, Chu Anping shamelessly put forward the fallacy of "the Party's world," saying that "...the poor relationship between the Party and the masses in the past few years has become a problem that urgently needs to be adjusted in the current political life of our country. What is the key to this problem? In my opinion, the key lies in the ideological problem of 'the Party's world'." Here, we should first point out that what Chu Anping calls adjusting the political life of our country is nothing but replacing the dictatorship of the proletariat with the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. The so-called urgent need for adjustment is the urgent need to implement bourgeois restoration. Chu Anping uses "the Party's world" to slander and attack the Communist Party, which is a complete example of judging a gentleman's heart with a villain's mind. Because this "Party's world" originates from "the family's world." We know that Chiang Kai-shek had a "Chiang's world," and Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji also wanted to have a "Zhang's world" and "Luo's world," while Chu Anping also wanted to create a "Chu's world" in "News" or Guangming Daily. This kind of "family's world" thinking is a product of private ownership and is the ideology of slave owners, feudal lords, and capitalists. It has nothing to do with the proletariat and its vanguard. As early as the Book of Rites, there appeared the idea of "the world is for all, and a world of great harmony," and the Lvshi Chunqiu also mentioned that "the world belongs to the people of the world." Some progressive thinkers in the late Ming Dynasty also vigorously advocated the idea that "the world belongs to the people of the world." Kang Youwei, the leader of the Reform Movement of 1898, even wrote the utopian Book of Great Harmony. The good wishes of these people are commendable, but it is always a beautiful fantasy. This kind of fantasy also appeared in Europe, which is the utopian authors Malthus and the three great utopian socialists Saint-Simon, Fourier, and Owen. Facts have proved that to truly achieve a world of great harmony, to truly make the world belong to the people of the world, it is necessary to rely on the thoroughly revolutionary and great working class, and it is necessary to rely on the vanguard of this class—the great Communist Party. Because only the working class and its vanguard, the Communist Party, which bear the historical task of thoroughly eliminating private ownership, are the firm opponents of various forms of "family's world." Our resolute suppression of Chiang's world and our resolute attack on the Zhang's world, Luo's world, and the like, which bourgeois rightists hope for, are iron proofs. Therefore, I think Chu Anping's theory of "the Party's world" is not worth refuting at all, and it is not even necessary to argue with him about how many non-Party people are working in our organs and schools, because that is not important. In fact, we still only have 12 million party members today, and this number is only a drop in the ocean compared with the population of 650 million. Who can create a monolithic Party's world here? I don't think the problem lies here. The problem is that we cannot feel that we are in the wrong just because Chu Anping scolds us for being "the Party's world." On the contrary, we should clearly express that today's world of new China is the world led by the Communist Party. Facts have proved that only a China led by the Communist Party belongs to the people, and this world truly belongs to the people. The workers, peasants, and intellectuals of China all feel that every mine, every factory, every organ, school, every railway bridge, and even every inch of land in our beautiful motherland belongs to the collective and also belongs to themselves. Only the new China led by the Communist Party has realized the great ideals of "the world of great harmony" and "the world belongs to the people of the world" that our ancestors have hoped for for thousands of years. The work of the Communist Party members is to improve the socialist consciousness of the people and enhance their awareness of being masters of their own country. Isn't this a fact? Of course, bourgeois rightists cannot understand this at all. Chu Anping here is using "the Party's world" as an excuse to attack and even abolish the leadership of the Party. Therefore, we cannot but be forced to theoretically explain the leading role of the Party in socialist construction and the dictatorship of the proletariat. Here, there are three issues that deserve special attention.

    First of all, it should be explained that "the Party is the highest form of class organization of the proletariat," which is a famous formula of Lenin. Stalin gave the following explanation of Lenin's formula in the first of his twelve conditions for the Bolshevikization of the Party: "The Party must not regard itself as an appendage of parliamentary elections—as the Social Democrats in practice regard themselves; nor should it be regarded as a free adjunct to trade unions—as some anarcho-syndicalists sometimes repeatedly say about this point; but should be regarded as the highest form of class association of the proletariat, responsible for leading all other forms of organization of the proletariat—from trade unions to parliamentary groups." This means that the Party is not only an organized force, but also the highest organizational form that transcends all other organizations of the working class, and its natural mission lies in leading all other organizations of the working class. Therefore, the Party leads the government, the Party leads the army, the Party leads the trade unions, the Party leads the cooperatives, the Party leads the industrial and mining enterprises, schools, the Party leads the mass organizations of women and youth, and finally, the Party must also lead the democratic parties; the Party realizes political and ideological leadership in all these organizations, which is a matter of course. And it is precisely on this point that Chu Anping is most saddened. He draws circles and limits the scope of our Party's work, saying that the Party only "needs to control certain key points of the state organs," and believes that "in the whole country, no matter how big or small the unit is, even a section or a group must arrange for a Party member to be the leader... Is this kind of practice too much?" We say that there is no excessive place here (let alone too much), but only insufficient places. The Party is politically leading everything, how can it only control certain key points of the state? What are the key points? What are not the key points? Where should there be Party leadership, and where should there not be Party leadership? Chu Anping should say it more clearly. May I ask Chu Anping, is Guangming Daily considered a key point? You control this key point, and you change its political direction and make it a newspaper that advocates bourgeois restoration. Should the Party control it or not? The Party's political leadership is carried out through its various levels of Party organizations and Party members. This is why a Party member is arranged to be the leader in both large and small units. Without these leaders (whether it is the secretary or the group leader), through whom will the Party's policies and guidelines be implemented? You want leaders to ignite fires here and collude there, but you don't want the Communist Party to have a leader in all aspects and units. What is the intention? To put it bluntly, it is: if it is not the Communist Party's leader, it is the leader of the Zhang-Luo alliance; if it is not the leader of the proletariat, it is the leader of the bourgeoisie; if it is not the leader of the left, it is the leader of the right; if it is not a leader who can accept the leadership of the Party, it is a leader who opposes and resists the leadership of the Party. Isn't this very clear? Of course, it must also be explained here that in the past, present, and future of our country, it is impossible for all responsible work to be done by purely Party member cadres. The facts are very clear that, from the central government down to the grassroots units, a large number of excellent non-Party cadres are doing responsible work. They have excellently completed the glorious tasks entrusted to them by the state and the people. Communist Party members regard them as good teachers and helpful friends with respect. It is regrettable that Zhang Bojun and Luo Longji are both ministers of our country, and Chu Anping himself is also the editor-in-chief of a central-level newspaper. It can be said that the country treats them very well, but they have failed to live up to the trust of the country and the people and insist on being rightists. What can be said? From this point of view, the Party and the state can never rely on the leaders of the bourgeoisie or the leaders of the Zhang-Luo alliance to implement its policies and guidelines. We have learned another lesson from this anti-rightist struggle. One of the common characteristics of your leading figures of rightist elements is that they are double-dealers who outwardly agree but inwardly oppose and stab you in the back. The same policy, the same guideline, will change its nature once it gets into your hands. You use the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" to restore bourgeois sociology, economics, and history; you use the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" to conspire for bourgeois restoration and subvert the people's democratic dictatorship. You use the opposition to sectarianism to abolish the leadership of the Communist Party; you use the opposition to dogmatism to oppose Marxism; you use Chairman Mao's report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people to create contradictions, expand contradictions, and even transform contradictions, hoping to create a Hungarian incident in China. Therefore, in order to realize its leadership, the Party must have its various levels of organizations, and it must select loyal Party members and non-Party members to engage in leadership work in all aspects. The Party must rely on the leaders of the Communist Party members, the leaders of the left, and not rely on the rightist leaders of the Zhang-Luo alliance! But you will say again that it is laymen leading experts. Yes, we do not need to hide our shortcomings. Some of our cadres are unfamiliar with certain professions during the construction period. We admit that we have some laymen in some places. However, we must also explain that laymen can become experts. Our comrades can learn from experts, ask teachers for advice, and ask friends for advice. Many of our old Party members and old cadres have changed from experts in class struggle to experts in science and technology, and they are indeed increasing day by day. They will not always be laymen. What is particularly important is that you cannot deny that our Marxists and old cadres of the Party are true experts in socialist revolution and socialist construction, right? If you want to deny this point, then how can you explain the most basic fact that the Chinese revolution was victorious and socialist construction was victorious? Of course, it must also be emphasized here that Party member cadres arranged in any large or small unit must maintain close ties with the masses and must both lead the masses forward and learn from the masses. All our work is carried out by relying on the joint cooperation of Party member cadres and non-Party member cadres. The Party does not have a monolithic approach to the use of cadres. As long as a non-Party cadre is loyal to the socialist cause, the Party gives him a high degree of political trust. The Party always advocates the close cooperation of Party member cadres and non-Party cadres, and it is illegal for Communist Party members to exclude non-Party cadres. Precisely because of this, the close cooperation of Party member cadres and non-Party cadres is an important foundation for the victory of our cause. However, the Party implements political leadership without exception for any unit responsible for by Party member cadres or non-Party cadres. The Party cannot turn itself into a worthless and dispensable appendage. In short, we always adhere to Lenin's formula that the Party is the highest form of class organization of the proletariat and that the Party is the basic leading force for realizing the dictatorship of the proletariat. Chu Anping's various attacks are in vain.

    Secondly, it must also be explained that the Party is the highest form of class organization of the proletariat, and at the same time, it is the true embodiment of the connection between the advanced troops of the working class and the millions of masses of the working class. Therefore, the Party is the leading force of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The Party leads the dictatorship of the proletariat, but the Party does not directly realize this dictatorship. The dictatorship of the proletariat is not the dictatorship of the Party. I feel that it is very important to explain this problem, because Chu Anping is using the fact that people still have some misconceptions about this to bewilder people and attack the Party. Lenin said: "Generally and as a whole, the result is a flexible and relatively broad and powerful proletarian organ that is non-Party in form, and the Party is through this organ to maintain close contact with its own class and the masses, and the class dictatorship is realized through this organ under the leadership of the Party." If "there are no 'belts' connecting the vanguard of the advanced class with the masses of this class and with the working masses, then a dictatorship cannot be exercised." Lenin also said: "The Party absorbs the vanguard of the proletariat into itself, and this vanguard realizes the dictatorship of the proletariat. Without a foundation like trade unions, a dictatorship cannot be realized, and state functions cannot be performed. These functions must be realized through some new special organs, namely, through Soviet organs." Lenin's instructions are very important. That is to say, the Party does not directly realize the dictatorship, but the Party is the leading force for realizing the dictatorship. That is to say, the dictatorship is a matter for the state organs and a matter for the working class and the working people themselves. The concept of the dictatorship of the proletariat is a national concept. The role of the Party is to provide political and ideological leadership to the state and to carry out persuasive education work for the masses. The Party uses its own program and line to lead the state and the masses, and the complete realization of the program and line depends on the conscious and voluntary actions of the masses. The Central Committee of our Party and Chairman Mao applied these theories of Lenin to our country and adopted the system of the People's Congress, and the people exercise their power through the People's Congress. This power is concentratedly expressed in Articles 1 and 2 of the Constitution. Article 1 of the Constitution is: The People's Republic of China is a people's democratic state led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants. Article 2 is: All power in the People's Republic of China belongs to the people. The organs through which the people exercise their power are the National People's Congress and the local people's congresses at various levels. The National People's Congress, the local people's congresses at various levels, and other state organs all implement democratic centralism. In order to implement this democratic centralism, the Party put forward the famous formula of the mass line of "from the masses, to the masses." In our country, whether it is the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Movements, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, or the current struggle against bourgeois rightists, it is realized through this method of the mass line. (In this anti-rightist struggle, the method of the mass line has been raised to a new form of great debate). In this way, the correctness of the Party's leadership is guaranteed, and at the same time, the powerful force of the state and the people to exercise dictatorship over the enemy is strengthened. The same is true for other aspects of national life, such as industrial construction and agricultural construction. Taking the famous Forty Articles of Agriculture as an example, it is enough to illustrate the problem. In the political life of our country, the fundamental principle of combining dictatorship and democracy, and combining democracy and centralism is like this. However, Chu Anping, this rightist element, either turns a blind eye to all this or fundamentally distorts it. He only sees the Party issuing orders, but does not see the conscious and voluntary actions of the masses. He even feels uncomfortable when there is a Communist Party member working in a section or a group, and spreads rumors that "no matter how big or small the matter is, you have to look at the color of the Communist Party members to do things, and it only counts when the Party members nod their heads." It is said that this is the Party's idea of "all land under heaven belongs to the emperor," and because of this idea, China has formed "a monolithic situation of a family's world." It is also said that this has made non-Party people lose their "self-esteem and sense of responsibility to the country," which is really doing everything possible to incite discord and stir up trouble. All of this, Chu Anping is nothing more than saying that today's China is our Party exercising dictatorship, and our Party members are all sectarian elements who are exercising dictatorship over non-Party people. Therefore, people should rise up to overthrow this dictatorship and drive away these sectarian elements. This is completely nonsense. Of course, in a country of proletarian dictatorship, as Lenin and Stalin once analyzed, one fact can be regarded as the highest manifestation of the Party's leading role, that is, the state and other mass organizations will not decide any political or organizational issue without the Party's leadership instructions. Why does Chu Anping insist on making vicious attacks on this issue? Obviously, Chu Anping's set is also the political bewilderment and political agitation of "laymen cannot lead experts" shouted by all rightist elements, Luo Longji's shout that "small intellectuals of the proletariat cannot lead large intellectuals of the petty bourgeoisie," and Tan Tianrong's saying that "all the adults of Ephesus should be strangled to death and the city should be handed over to the young people." In a word, it is to tell the Communist Party to step down! To tell the Communist Party members to get out! Here, we should solemnly tell Chu Anping that the political life of our country is healthy, normal, and full of vitality. You can cite a hundred or a thousand shortcomings and mistakes, but you cannot overthrow the most fundamental one, that the Party is correctly leading the country and the people and building a great socialist country through the dictatorship of the proletariat; the majority of our cadres are wholeheartedly and diligently serving the people. You can cite a hundred or a thousand shortcomings and mistakes, but you cannot overthrow the most fundamental one, that they are dedicated to the cause of communism under the leadership of the Party, and they are the most resolute enemies of the bourgeois rightists! Of course, our Party never hides its own shortcomings, and it never condones Party members who make mistakes. Whoever violates the working methods of the mass line and violates the principles of democratic centralism, if someone really acts arbitrarily and engages in sectarianism, he will not only be opposed by the masses, but also be criticized and criticized by the Party. As for what kind of "masses" Chu Anping is talking about, it is worth considering. Are they rightist elements? Are they Tan Tianrong and Lin Xiling? Are they Chu Anping and Fei Xiaotong? If it is you people, then the Communist Party members have no need and no way to unite with you! We don't want to lead you either, because you are the enemy! Chu Anping also said here something like "self-esteem" and "sense of responsibility to the country." We don't need to pay attention to it, because your self-esteem is a manifestation of the reactionary nature of the bourgeois rightist elements, a hatred for the Communist Party and the working class; we don't hope that you have any sense of responsibility to our country. Because what can arouse your sense of responsibility is not the country of the proletarian dictatorship, but the country of the bourgeois dictatorship. Because what you oppose as monolithic is essentially that you are hoping for a "white monolithic." As long as the "white monolithic" bourgeois dictatorship appears, you - Chu Anping will have a higher and higher sense of responsibility! Of course, we are not that we do not hope that you will have a real sense of responsibility for our country after a real transformation!

    Furthermore, we cannot but say a few words about what Chu Anping said: "The ideological problem of this 'Party's world' is the ultimate source of all sectarian phenomena." Since the problem of "the Party's world" is a fabrication used by Chu Anping to attack and slander the Communist Party, then it is certainly untenable to say that it is the ultimate source of sectarianism. However, here we should also tell Chu Anping a little bit of common sense of historical materialism. The thing called thought cannot be the ultimate source, because thought still has its material class source. Sectarianism does exist in our Party, but it is fundamentally incompatible with our Party's ideology. The Marxist-Leninist party not only does not produce sectarianism, but also our Party openly declares that sectarianism (whether it is towards comrades within the Party or non-Party people) is illegal within the Party. We regard it as a product of class society and as a reflection of bourgeois ideology within the Party, just like bureaucracy. Bourgeois private ownership is the root cause of sectarianism. Therefore, when we fight against these things, we always call it clearing away the influence of bourgeois ideology within the Party. This is obviously very fair.

    When we criticize Chu Anping's fallacy of "the Party's world," we must first note that the Communist Party is the leading force of the proletariat, and the leadership of the Communist Party is the most important thing in the dictatorship of the proletariat. It should be said without reservation that it is the soul of the dictatorship of the proletariat. It must always be remembered that the dictatorship of the proletariat and the leadership of the Party are always standing on the same working line and are acting in the same direction. Without the leadership of the Party, there would be no dictatorship of the proletariat, and therefore, there would be no socialist system. (This article is the second part of Comrade Sun Dingguo's speech at the joint conference held by the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society and Guangming Daily on November 28 to criticize Chu Anping's reactionary words and deeds.)

    驳“党天下”的谬论
　　孙定国
    储安平为了反对社会主义制度，而反对无产阶级专政，为了反对无产阶级专政，而又更进一步地反对党的领导，这是很自然的。
    刘少奇同志在党的第八次代表大会上说：“在我们国家的社会主义事业中不可能没有无产阶级专政，而无产阶级专政是经过无产阶级的政党——共产党的领导来实现的。中国共产党的领导的力量，在于他有马克思列宁主义的思想武器，有正确的政治路线和组织路线，有丰富的斗争经验和工作经验，善于把全国人民的智慧集中起来，并且把这种智慧表现为统一的意志和有纪律的行动。不但在过去，而且在今后，为了保证我们的国家能够有效地处理国内和国际的复杂事务，都必须有这样一个党的领导。这是全国各阶层人民和各民主党派根据实际生活所共同承认的。”看来，储安平是十分不满意这一点的，他正是疯狂地向着这一点进行攻击。当然从储安平的阶级本能出发，他是能够了解到，有了共产党的领导，就没有办法把无产阶级专政搞垮。要搞垮无产阶级专政，就必须首先来攻击以至取消共产党的领导。这就是问题的本质所在。因此，储安平无耻地提出“党天下”的谬论，说什么“……几年来党群关系不好，成为目前我国政治生活中急须调整的一个问题。这个问题的关键究竟何在？据我看来，关键在于‘党天下’的这个思想问题上。”我们在这里应该首先指出，储安平所说的调整我国的政治生活，不是别的，就是要以资产阶级专政代替无产阶级专政。所谓急须调整，就是急须实行资产阶级复辟。储安平用“党天下”来诬蔑和攻击共产党，这是十足的以小人之心，度君子之腹的办法。因为这个“党天下”是导源于“家天下”的。我们知道，蒋介石有个“蒋天下”，章伯钧和罗隆基也想有个“章天下”“罗天下”，而储安平也想在“社讯”或者是光明日报来一个“储天下”。这种家天下的思想是私有制的产物，是奴隶主、封建主、资本家的思想。它和无产阶级以及它的先锋队是根本无干的。中国早在礼运上就出现过天下为公，世界大同的思想，吕氏春秋也提到过“天下者天下人之天下也”，明末的一些进步思想家，也大力地宣传过“天下者天下人的天下”的思想。戊戌政变的领袖康有为还写过乌托邦的大同书。这些人的善良心愿，是可嘉的，但是，它总是一个美好的空想。这种空想在欧洲也出现过，这就是乌托邦的作者马尔和圣西门、傅立叶、欧文三大空想社会主义者。事实证明真正要作到世界大同，真正要作到天下属于天下人，那就必须依靠彻底革命的、伟大的工人阶级，那就必须依靠这个阶级的先锋队——伟大的共产党。因为只有负担着彻底消灭私有制的历史任务的工人阶级和它的先锋队共产党，才是各种形形色色的“家天下”的坚决反对者。我们坚决地扑灭了蒋天下而又坚决地打击了资产阶级右派分子所希望的章天下罗天下以及什么储天下之类的东西，就是铁证。因此，我认为储安平的“党天下”的理论，本来是不值一驳的，甚至于也不需要和他去辩论什么我们的那些机关那些学校有多少党外人士在那里工作的问题，因为那是不关重要的。事实上我们直到今天还不过一千二百万党员，这个数字和六万万五千万人口比较起来还只不过是沧海的一粟，在这里有谁能够来一个清一色的党天下呢？我认为问题不在这里，问题是在于我们不能因为储安平骂我们是“党天下”，我们就感到有什么理屈了。相反，我们应该明白表示，今天这个新中国的天下，就是共产党领导的天下。事实证明，只有共产党领导的中国，才是属于人民的，这个天下，才是真正属于人民的天下。中国的工人农民和知识分子，都感觉到，我们美丽祖国的每一矿山，每一工厂，每一机关、学校，每一铁道桥梁，以至于每一寸土地，都是属于集体的而又都是属于自己的。只有共产党领导的新中国，才实现了我们先人几千年来所希望的“大同世界”和“天下者天下人之天下也”的远大理想。而共产党员的工作，就是要提高人民的社会主义觉悟，增强人们对自己的国家当家作主的思想。这难道不是事实吗？当然资产阶级右派根本不能这样理解。储安平在这里，却是在借口于“党天下”而来攻击以至于取消党的领导。因此，我们就不能不被迫的在理论上来阐明党在社会主义建设和无产阶级专政中的领导作用问题。在这里有三个问题值得着重加以说明。
    首先应该说明，“党是无产阶级阶级组织的最高形式”，这是列宁的一个著名公式。斯大林在他的党的布尔什维克化十二条的第一条中就对列宁的这个公式作了如下的解释：“必须使得党不把自己看成为国会选举机构的附属物——像社会民主党在实际上把自己看成的那样；也不能看成为职工会的不要钱的附加品——如同某些无政府主义工团主义分子有时对于这点所反复说的那样；而应看作是无产阶级的阶级联合之最高形式，负责领导无产阶级的其他一切形式的组织——自职工会到国会党团——的使命。”这就是党不只是一个有组织的部队，而且是超出于工人阶级其他一切组织的最高组织形式，其天然的使命就是在于领导工人阶级其他一切组织。因此，党领导着政府，党领导着军队，党领导着工会，党领导着合作社，党领导着工矿企业，学校，党领导着妇女的青年的群众组织，最后，党还要领导着各民主党派；党在这一切组织中实现着政治、思想上的领导，这是天经地义。而恰恰在这一点上，是储安平所最痛心的，他给我们党的工作划出了圈圈，限定了范围，说什么党只“需要掌握国家的机关的某些枢纽”，而认为在全国范围内，“不论大小单位，甚至一个科一个组都要安排一个党员作头儿……这样的做法是不是太过分了一点。”我们说，在这里没有过分的地方（更不用说太过分了），而只是还有不够的地方。党在政治上是领导一切的，怎么只能掌握国家的某些枢纽？什么是枢纽？什么不是枢纽？什么地方应该有党的领导，什么地方不应该有党的领导？储安平应该说得更清楚些。试问储安平，光明日报算不算个枢纽，这个枢纽由你掌握了，你就改变了它的政治方向，成为鼓吹资产阶级复辟的报纸，党到底应该掌握不应该掌握？党的政治领导，是通过它的各级党组织和党员去进行的。这就是为什么在大小单位都安排一个党员作头儿。没有这些头儿（不管是书记也算，组长也算），党的政策方针又通过谁们去贯彻去实行呢？你们要头儿，到这里点火，到那里串联，却独独地不叫共产党在各方面各单位有个头儿，这是用意何在呢？话要说穿了，就是：不是共产党的头儿，就是章罗联盟的头儿，不是无产阶级的头儿，就是资产阶级的头儿，不是左派的头儿，就是右派的头儿，不是能接受党的领导的头儿，就是反对和抵抗党的领导的头儿。这难道还不很明白吗？当然，在这里还必须说明，我们国家在过去、现在以及到将来，是不能都是清一色的党员干部作负责工作的，事实摆得很清楚，不论从中央政府一直到基层单位，大量的优秀的非党干部，在做着负责工作，他们出色地完成了国家和人民交付给他们的光荣任务，共产党员以尊敬的心情，把他们看作是良师益友。而遗憾的是章伯钧和罗隆基都是我们国家的部长，储安平本人也是中央一级报纸的总编辑，真可谓国家待之不为不厚矣，可是他们偏偏辜负了国家和人民的委托，偏偏要作右派。那有什么可说的呢？从这里看来，党和国家是永远也不能依靠资产阶级的头儿、依靠章罗联盟的头儿去贯彻执行它的政策方针的。从这次反右派斗争中我们又受到一次教训，你们那些右派分子的头面人物的共同特点之一就是阳奉阴违，三刀两刃的两面派。一样的政策，一样的方针，一到你们的手里就要变质。你们利用“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针来恢复资产阶级的社会学，经济学，历史学；你们利用“长期共存、互相监督”的方针来阴谋资产阶级复辟，颠覆人民民主专政。你们利用反对宗派主义来取消共产党的领导；利用反对教条主义来反对马克思主义；利用毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题的报告来制造矛盾，扩大矛盾以至于转化矛盾，希望在中国闹出个匈牙利事件。因此党要实现它的领导，就必须有它的各级组织，就必须选择忠实的党员非党员从事各方面的领导工作，党就必须依靠共产党员的头儿，左派的头儿，而不能依靠章罗联盟的那些右派的头儿！可是你们又要说，那是外行领导内行。是的，我们不需要掩饰自己的缺点，我们有些干部对于在建设时期的某些专业是生疏的，我们承认我们有些外行的地方，但是，我们还必须说明，外行是可以变成内行的。我们的同志可以向专家学习，可以向老师请教，向朋友请教，我们有许多老党员老干部，从阶级斗争的能手变成了科学技术方面的能手，确实是一天一天地增多起来了。他们不会永远是外行。而特别重要的是，我们马克思主义者、党的老干部，对于社会主义革命和社会主义建设，你们总不能不承认他们是真正的内行吧？如果你们想要否认这一点，那末，你们有什么办法来说明中国革命到底是怎么胜利的，社会主义建设到底是怎样胜利的这一最基本的事实呢？当然在这里，我们还必须强调指出，安排在任何大小单位的党员干部是要密切联系群众的，是既要领导群众前进而又要向群众学习的。我们的一切工作是依靠党员干部和非党员干部的共同合作来进行的。党在使用干部方面并没有清一色。非党的干部只要他忠实于社会主义事业，党是给予以高度的政治信任的。党总是提倡党员干部和非党干部的亲密合作的，共产党员排斥非党干部是非法的。正因为是这样，党员干部和非党干部的亲密合作是我们事业胜利的重要基础。可是，不论是党员干部还是非党干部负责的任何单位，党对于他们都是无例外地实行政治领导，党不能把自己变成不值钱的可有可无的附属品。总之，我们始终坚持党是无产阶级阶级组织的最高形式，党是实现无产阶级专政的基本领导力量——这一列宁的公式。储安平的种种攻击都是徒劳的。
    其次还要说明，党是无产阶级阶级组织的最高形式，而同时又是工人阶级先进部队与工人阶级千百万群众联系的真正体现者。因此，党是无产阶级专政的领导力量，党领导着无产阶级专政，但党并不是直接来实现这个专政。无产阶级专政并不就是党的专政。我感到说明这个问题非常重要，因为储安平正是利用人们对此还有些错误观念，向人们进行蛊惑，向党攻击。列宁说过：“一般和整个说来，结果就是一个在形式上非共产党的，灵活而比较广阔的，很有力量的无产阶级的机关，而党就是经过这个机关，去和本阶级以及群众密切联系的，阶级专政就是经过这个机关而在党领导之下来实现的”。如果“没有一些把先进阶级先锋队和这阶级群众，把这先锋队和劳动群众连结起来的‘引带’，那就不能实行专政”。列宁又说：“党是把无产阶级先锋队吸收到自身中来的，而这个先锋队就实现着无产阶级专政。没有职工会这样的基础，便不能实现专政，便不能执行国家机能。这些职能是必须经过一些也是新式特别机关，即经过苏维埃机关来实现的。”列宁的这些指示十分重要，这就是说，党不是直接来实现专政的，而党是实现专政的领导力量。这就是说，专政是国家机关的事情，是工人阶级和劳动人民自己的事情。无产阶级专政的概念是个国家的概念。而党的作用则是对于国家进行政治上和思想上的领导，对于群众进行说服教育工作。党是用自己的纲领路线来领导国家和群众的，而纲领路线的彻底实现，则是依靠群众的自觉自愿的行动。我们党的中央和毛主席把列宁的这些理论用之于我们的国家，就采取了人民代表大会的制度，人民通过代表大会来行使自己的权力。这种权力集中地表现在宪法的第一条和第二条中。宪法的第一条是：中华人民共和国是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家。第二条是：中华人民共和国的一切权力属于人民。人民行使权力的机关是全国人民代表大会和地方各级人民代表大会。全国人民代表大会、地方各级人民代表大会和其他国家机关，一律实行民主集中制。而为了贯彻这种民主集中制党又提出了有名的从群众中来到群众中去的群众路线的公式。在我国不论是三反、五反运动，肃反和镇压反革命的斗争，不论是当前所进行的反对资产阶级右派的斗争，都是通过这种群众路线的方法来实现的。（而在这次反右派斗争中，把群众路线的方法又提高到大辩论的新形式）。这样，既保证了党的领导的正确性，同时又加强了国家和人民对敌人实行专政的强大力量。对于国家生活的其他方面，例如工业建设，农业建设等，也同样是如此。即以著名的农业四十条纲要为例，也足以说明问题。在我们国家的政治生活里，专政与民主相结合，民主与集中相结合的根本原则就是如此。而储安平这个右派分子，对于这一切不是熟视无睹，就是根本歪曲。他只看到党在发号施令，而没有看到群众自觉自愿的行动。甚至于他对于一个科一个组有个共产党员在那里工作，都感到刺眼，并且造谣地说：“事无巨细，都要看共产党员的颜色办事，都要党员点了头才算数。”据说，这就是党的“莫非王土”的思想，由于这个思想，使中国形成了“一个家天下的清一色的局面。”并且还说，这样，就使党外人士丧失了“自尊心和对国家的责任感”，这真是极尽了煽风点火、挑拨离间的能事。所有这一切，储安平无非是在说，今天的中国就是我们党在专政，就是我们的党员而且都是一些宗派主义分子在对党外人士的专政。因此，人们应该起来打倒这个专政，赶走这些宗派主义分子。这完全是胡说八道。当然在无产阶级专政的国家里，如同列宁和斯大林所曾经分析过的，——有一件事实要算是党领导作用的最高表现，即国家和其他群众组织，非有党的领导指示，便不会决定任何一个政治问题或组织问题。为什么储安平偏偏要在这个问题上进行恶毒的攻击呢？显然，储安平的这一套也正就是一切右派分子所叫喊的“外行不能领导内行”，罗隆基叫喊的“无产阶级的小知识分子不能领导小资产阶级大知识分子，以及谭天荣所说的”爱非斯城的壮年人一齐绞死，把城交给青年人管理”的政治蛊惑和政治煽动。一句话，就是要叫共产党下台！要叫共产党员滚开！在这里，我们应该正告储安平，我们国家的政治生活，是健康的、正常的，生气勃勃的，你们可以举出一百条一千条缺点和错误，但是你们没有办法推翻最根本的一条，党在正确地领导着国家和人民，通过无产阶级专政来建设着伟大的社会主义国家；我们的干部中的大多数，是忠心耿耿勤勤恳恳为人民服务的。你们可以举出他们一百条一千条缺点和错误，但是你们没有办法推翻最根本的一条，他们是在党的领导下献身于共产主义事业，他们是资产阶级右派最坚决的敌人！当然我们党从来不掩盖自己的缺点，从来也不姑息犯错误的党员，谁要是违背了群众路线的工作方法，违反了民主集中制的原则，如果真正有人独断专行，搞宗派主义，那就不仅要受到群众的反对，而且还要受到党的指责和批判。至于储安平所说的“群众”是什么样子的“群众”，那就值得考虑了。是右派分子吗？是谭天荣和林希翎吗？是储安平和费孝通吗？如果是你们这些人，那共产党员是没有必要也没有办法和你们团结一致的！我们也不想对你们进行领导，因为你们是敌人！储安平在这里还说什么“自尊心”和“对国家的责任感”之类的话，我们也不必去理睬，因为你们的自尊心，是资产阶级右派分子的反动本性，对共产党，对工人阶级的一种仇恨心的表现；我们也不希望你们对我们的国家有什么责任感。因为能引起你们的责任感的，不是无产阶级专政的国家，而是资产阶级专政的国家。因为你们所反对的什么清一色，实质上你们是在希望来一个“白一色”。只要“白一色”的资产阶级专政出现了，你——储安平也就有了高度更高度的责任感了！当然，我们也不是不希望你们在真正地脱胎换骨之后，真正对于我们的国家有点责任感！
    再其次关于储安平所说的：“这个‘党天下’的思想问题，是一切宗派主义现象的最终根源”，我们也不能不说几句话。“党天下”的问题，既然是储安平用以攻击和诬蔑共产党的一种虚构，那么说它又是宗派主义的最终的根源，那当然就说不通了。但是，在这里我们还应该多少给储安平讲一点历史唯物主义的常识。思想这东西，总不能是最终的根源，因为思想还有它的物质的阶级的根源。宗派主义这个东西，在我们党内确实是有的，但是它又是和我们党的思想根本不相容的。马克思列宁主义的政党，它不仅不产生宗派主义，而且我们的党公开宣布宗派主义（不管它是对党内同志或者是党外人士）在党内是不合法的，我们把它和官僚主义一样看作是阶级社会的产物，看作是资产阶级的思想在党内的反映。资产阶级的私有制才是产生宗派主义的根源。因此，我们和这些东西作斗争的时候，总是把它叫作是肃清党内的资产阶级思想影响。这显然是十分公道的。
    在我们批判储安平的“党天下”的谬论的时候，我们必须首先注意到，共产党是无产阶级的领导力量，共产党的领导，是无产阶级专政中的最主要的东西。应该毫不隐讳地说，它就是无产阶级专政的灵魂。必须永远记住无产阶级专政是和党的领导永远站在一条工作路线上，是按照一个方向行动着的。没有党的领导，也就不可能有什么无产阶级专政，从而也就不可能有什么社会主义制度。（这篇文章是孙定国同志十一月二十八日在九三学社中央和光明日报联合举行的批判储安平反动言行大会上发言的第二部分）
