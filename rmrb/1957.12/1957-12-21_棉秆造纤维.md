    Cotton Stalks Make Fiber
    The Santai County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Sichuan Province has successfully trial-produced man-made fibers using cotton stalk bark, learning from the Chongqing May 1 Cotton Mill.
    This cooperative uses cotton stalk bark to manufacture fiber, achieving a yield rate of 80%. Every 100 jin of this fiber can be mixed with 30-40 jin of raw cotton to weave cloth. Without raw cotton, it can also be used to make medium-grade or better sacks and mosquito nets.
    The cost of making fiber from cotton stalk bark is not high, averaging only 6-7 jiao per jin. The remaining cotton stalks can also be used to make pulp. (Chen Zhizhang)

    棉秆造纤维
    四川省三台县供销社学习重庆五一造棉社用棉秆皮试制人造纤维成功。
    这个社用棉秆皮制造纤维，出成率达到80％。每百斤这种纤维再加上原棉三十一四十斤，就可织布，不加原棉，也可制中等以上的麻袋和蚊帐等。
    用棉秆皮制出纤维成本不高，平均每斤只六—七角，剩下的棉秆还可以制纸浆。（谌治章）
