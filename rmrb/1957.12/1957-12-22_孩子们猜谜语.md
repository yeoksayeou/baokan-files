    Children Guess Riddles
    Jiang Feng
    Whenever the family gathers around the fire during the long winter days, or enjoys the cool breeze on summer evenings, the children often need to find some games to enrich their lives. They often suggest to the adults: "Let's guess riddles, let's guess riddles!"
    Riddles are very popular with children. Like nursery rhymes, riddles are one of the earliest forms of literature accepted by children. It has a particularly charming attraction for children in their early school years. However, has such a literary form, beloved by children, been valued by all parents? No.
    Therefore, I would like to suggest to parents: "Try to give your children some riddles to guess!"
    Don't think of guessing riddles as just a pastime; it is a beneficial activity for educating children. Riddles often use bright, vivid, and rhythmic language to describe the characteristics of things children often see, such as natural phenomena, animals and plants, daily necessities, and various human organs, and ask children to guess, cultivating their thinking abilities. For example, sitting with your child under the bright moonlight, ask the following riddle:
      Sometimes it looks far away,
      Curved like a boat;
      Sometimes it looks far away,
      Round like a plate;
      Everyone guess,
      Is it a boat or a plate?
    This guides children to develop their thinking activities from the shape of the boat and the shape of the plate, allowing them to associate with the shift of time and the changes in shape, and this change in shape is related to "looking far away." Through this series of thinking activities, they finally guess the moon. This is of great help to developing children's imagination and cultivating their thinking abilities.
    Through guessing riddles, children can learn about various natural phenomena, such as the sun, moon, stars, wind, frost, rain, dew...; recognize the characteristics of various animals and plants, recognize the uses of various objects, and recognize the functions of various human organs. This broadens children's horizons and enriches their knowledge.
    Children are extremely interested in everything around them. They often ask adults all kinds of questions. If we can often give children some riddles to guess, we can help them solve a series of doubts, and solve them in such an interesting way. For example, in order to let children recognize some fruits, you can give children the following riddle:
    The eldest sister is beautiful,
    The second sister is full of juice,
    The third sister shows her teeth,
    The fourth sister has a crooked mouth.
    In this way, children recognize four kinds of fruits: apples, grapes, pomegranates, and peaches; and through the thinking process of guessing riddles, they understand the method of recognizing things from their characteristics. For another example:
    "Hair on top,
    Hair on the bottom,
    A big grape in the middle.
    If you can't guess,
    Take a few peeks." - Eyes
    This allows children to recognize their own body organs and their functions.
    From the above examples, it can be seen that guessing riddles has a certain effect on enriching children's imagination, broadening their horizons, and consolidating their acquired knowledge.
    The language of riddles is so accurate, concise, vivid, and full of rhythm. This beautiful language can guide children to master a rich vocabulary and cultivate their expression skills, which is also of great help to the development of children's language.
    Sometimes, guessing riddles subtly cultivates children's excellent qualities. Such as:
    "Little baby,
    Truly good,
    Loves cleanliness,
    Works diligently,
    Spits out silk to make clothes." - Silkworm
    Doesn't this imperceptibly educate children to develop good hygiene habits and the excellent virtue of loving labor?
    Therefore, giving children riddles to guess is also a powerful tool for education, which can play a good role in children's intellectual, moral, and aesthetic education.
    If you think what I have said makes some sense, then try it, compile or select some riddles for your children to guess! I believe it will be warmly welcomed by your children. (Attached picture)

    孩子们猜谜语
    蒋风
    每当在漫长的冬日一家人围炉烤火的时候，或者在夏夜的傍晚乘风凉的时候，孩子们往往需要找些游戏来丰富自己的生活内容，他们常常会向大人提出这样的建议：“挑谜猜，挑谜猜！”
    谜语，是深受孩子们欢迎的。谜语和儿歌一样，是较早为孩子们所接受的一种文学形式。它对学龄初期的儿童尤其具有魅人的吸引力。可是，这样一种为孩子们所喜爱的文学形式，有没有被所有的家长们重视呢？没有。
    因此，我想向做父母的提出：“尽可能挑些谜语给孩子们猜吧！”
    不要把猜谜语仅仅看做一种消遣，这是教育孩子的一种有益的活动。谜语往往把一些孩子们常见的事物，如自然现象、动植物、日常用品、人体各项器官等，用一种明快、生动而又有韵律的语言，把事物的特征描写出来，叫孩子们去猜想，培养了孩子们的思惟能力。例如：带孩子坐在皎洁的月光下，提出如下的谜语：
      有时远远看，
      弯弯像只船；
      有时远远看，
      圆圆像个盘；
      大家猜猜看，
      是船还是盘。
    这就引导孩子们从船的形状和盘的形状展开思惟活动，让他联想到时间的转移和引起形状的变化，而且这个形状的变化又是与“远远看”联系着的，通过这一系列的思考活动，最后猜出月亮来。这对发展孩子们的想像力，培养孩子们的思惟能力有很大的帮助。
    通过猜谜的活动，可以让孩子们认识各种自然现象，如太阳、月亮、星星、风、霜、雨、露……；认识各种动物、植物的特征，认识各种器物的用处，认识人体各种器官的功能。这就扩大了孩子们的眼界，丰富了孩子们的知识。
    孩子们对于周围的一切事物都感到极大的兴趣，他们经常向大人提出各种各样的问题，如果我们能经常给孩子们猜一些谜语，就能帮助孩子们解决一连串的疑问，而且解决得那么有趣。例如：为了让孩子们认识一些水果，可以给孩子们猜下面一个谜语：
    大姐美一美，
    二姐一嘟水，
    三姐露着牙，
    四姐弯着嘴。
    这样，孩子们就认识了苹果、葡萄、石榴、桃子四种水果；并且经猜谜的思惟过程，懂得从事物的特征来认识事物的方法。又如：
    “上边毛，
    下边毛，
    当中一颗大葡萄。
    猜不着，
    瞧几瞧。”——眼睛
    这可以让孩子们认识自己身体上器官和他的功能。
    从以上的例子可以说明，猜谜对于丰富孩子的想像力，扩大他们的视野，巩固他们已经获得的知识，都有一定的作用。
    谜语的语言又是那么准确、简洁、形象而又富于韵律。这种优美的语言，可以引导孩子掌握丰富的语汇，培养自己的表达能力，这对发展孩子的语言，也有很大的作用。
    有时候，猜谜还在潜移默化的作用下，培养了孩子们优秀的品质。如：
    “小宝宝，
    真正好，
    爱清洁，
    勤做工，
    吐出丝来做衣袄。”——蚕
    这不是无形中就教育孩子要养成爱清洁的卫生习惯和热爱劳动的优良品德吗？
    所以，给孩子们猜谜也是进行教育的有力工具，对孩子们的智育、德育、美育都能起到良好的作用。
    要是认为我谈的还有一些道理的话，那末，你就试试看，编制或挑选一些谜语给你的孩子猜猜吧！我相信，一定会受到你的孩子热烈欢迎的。（附图片）
