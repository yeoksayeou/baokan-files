    Cannot Live Like That
    "Can No Longer Live Like That" is an exciting film title, and the story it depicts is equally exciting. This Korean film tells the story of the earth-shattering changes that occurred in a village near the 38th parallel during the Korean People's Liberation War. This is a village that has suffered greatly; it was once liberated, but due to the temporary withdrawal of the People's Army, it fell into the clutches of the enemy again! Under the heavy burden, the people of this village uttered an angry cry from the bottom of their hearts: We can no longer live like this! They took active action, organized guerrillas to cooperate with the People's Army main force in combat; they showed noble qualities of loyalty and unyieldingness in the face of the enemy. Finally, the enemy was driven away, and the people regained their liberation. We can no longer live like that, and people will not only eliminate suffering with their own hands, but also create a bright and beautiful future with their own hands.

    不能那样活下去
    “再也不能那样活下去”是一个激动人心的片名，而它所描叙的故事内容也同样令人激动。这部朝鲜影片写的是三八线附近的一个村庄，在朝鲜人民解放战争期间所发生的翻天覆地的变化。这是一个多难的村庄，它曾经获得解放；但由于人民军暂时的撤退，又陷入敌人的魔掌！在沉重的负荷下，这个村庄的人民从心底发出了愤怒的声音：再也不能这样活下去了！他们积极行动起来，组织了游击队配合人民军主力作战；他们在敌人面前表现了忠贞不屈的崇高品质。终于，敌人被赶走了，人们重新获得了解放。再也不能那样活下去了，人们不仅用自己的手消除了苦难，还要用自己的手，创建光明美好的未来。
