Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 21st: The ninth session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union concluded today at the Kremlin.

After extensive discussion, the session passed the law on the 1958 National Economic Development Plan, the 1958 State Budget of the Soviet Union, and the resolution on the implementation of the 1956 State Budget. It also approved the decrees issued by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union during the seventh and ninth sessions.

Today, Lobanov presided over the closing sessions of the Union Council and the Council of Nationalities. Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko responded to inquiries from the deputies to the Soviet government regarding the current state of negotiations on disarmament.

First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, delivered a lengthy speech on some issues of the international situation. His speech was repeatedly interrupted by enthusiastic applause.

The session unanimously passed a resolution expressing support for the Soviet government's foreign policy and the proposals put forward in Bulganin's letters to the heads of Western countries and the Soviet government's notes to UN member states.

Xinhua News Agency, December 21st: TASS, Moscow: The Union Council and the Council of Nationalities of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union continued their sessions on the 20th.

The sessions discussed and adopted reports on the 1958 National Economic Development Plan, the 1958 State Budget, and the implementation of the 1956 Budget. The 1958 budget adopted by the session stipulates that the total state budget revenue for 1958 is 642,965,172,000 rubles, and the total expenditure is 627,742,125,000 rubles.

More than 40 deputies participated in the discussions in the two chambers.

The speech of Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, received great attention. He said that the Soviet Union is fully capable of surpassing the United States on the entire scientific front. At present, the Soviet Union has more specialized personnel with higher education than any other country in the world. The average age of young people graduating from Soviet universities is 22 years old, which is very important. This makes it possible for them to reach the peak of science at a very young age.

Xinhua News Agency, December 21st: TASS, Moscow: The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union today passed a resolution fully endorsing the foreign policy of the Soviet government. The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union fully supports the proposals put forward in Bulganin's letters to the heads of governments and the Soviet government's notes to UN member states.

The resolution pointed out that these proposals are in line with the tasks of easing international tensions, stopping the Cold War and the arms race, and expanding peaceful cooperation between countries.

The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union believes that, with the arms race, especially the arms race in atomic and hydrogen weapons, still continuing, it is necessary to take all measures to stop events from developing in a dangerous direction and to safeguard the cause of peace. The following steps would serve this purpose:

    The major powers possessing atomic and hydrogen weapons—the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom—should not use these types of weapons;

    The Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom should undertake obligations to cease all testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons from January 1, 1958;

    The Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom should reach an agreement not to deploy any type of nuclear weapons on the territories of East Germany and West Germany, and accept the proposals put forward by Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic regarding not producing or deploying nuclear weapons on the territories of these countries and West Germany;

    Significantly reduce the armed forces and armaments of all countries, and first and foremost, the major powers with the strongest armed forces;

    Reach an agreement on non-aggression between members of the North Atlantic Alliance and members of the Warsaw Treaty;

    Reach an agreement not to take any measures that would undermine the independence of countries in the Middle East and Near East, and not to use force in resolving issues related to this region;

    Those countries that are still carrying out war propaganda should stop such propaganda and strive to expand international trade and scientific and cultural ties between countries.

The resolution said that the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union is convinced that direct contact between the leaders of the great powers and their discussion of pressing international issues will help to find ways to ease the current international tensions and strengthen mutual trust between nations.

The resolution pointed out that in the current world situation, that is, with the existence of capitalist and socialist countries, the fact that any attempt to change this situation by external force, any attempt to change the political system by interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, and any attempt to forcibly change territories and undermine the status quo, will cause tragic consequences for world peace—this fact is being increasingly widely recognized.

The resolution believes that the decisions of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization conference prove that the leading countries of this organization intend to continue to pursue policies that endanger the cause of peace. In view of the fact that the leaders of the North Atlantic Alliance participating countries have declared that these countries advocate not using force against other countries, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union is willing to make new and important contributions to consolidating peace and creating an atmosphere of trust between peoples. Therefore, in this resolution, it entrusts the Soviet government to study the issue of further reducing the Soviet armed forces, maintaining the remaining number of armed forces and armaments at a necessary level sufficient to fully guarantee the defense interests of the Soviet Union, until an international disarmament agreement is reached. The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union hopes that the United States, the United Kingdom, and France will also take steps to reduce their armed forces, thereby contributing to the cause of establishing true international security.

    苏联最高苏维埃两院会议通过决议
    拥护苏联政府和平外交政策
    通过发展国民经济计划和国家预算
    据新华社莫斯科21日电  苏联最高苏维埃第九次会议今天在克里姆林宫闭幕。
    会议经过广泛讨论以后通过了关于1958年发展国民经济计划法、苏联1958年国家预算法，以及关于1956年国家预算执行情况的决议，批准了在第七次和第九次会议期间苏联最高苏维埃主席团所发布的命令。
    今天，洛巴诺夫主持了联盟院和民族院的闭幕会议。苏联外交部长葛罗米柯回答了代表们向苏联政府提出的询问，他们问现在各国关于裁军问题的谈判情况如何？
    苏共中央第一书记、苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫在会上就国际局势的一些问题发表了长篇讲话。他的讲话一再被热烈的掌声所打断。
    会议一致通过了一项决议，表示拥护苏联政府的外交政策，以及布尔加宁致西方国家首脑的信中和苏联政府给联合国会员国的照会中所提出的各项建议。
    据新华社21日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联最高苏维埃联盟院和民族院分别在20日继续开会。
    会议讨论并且通过了有关1958年发展国民经济计划、1958年度国家预算和1956年预算执行情况的报告。会议通过的1958年预算中规定，1958年国家预算总收入为六千四百二十九亿六千五百一十七万二千卢布，总支出为六千二百七十七亿四千二百一十二万五千卢布。
    参加两院会议的讨论的代表共有四十多人。
    苏联科学院院长涅斯米扬诺夫的发言受到了很大的注意。他说，苏联完全有条件在整个科学阵线上赶过美国。目前苏联受过高等教育的专门人材比世界上任何国家都多。苏联高等学校毕业的青年的年龄平均是二十二岁，这是很重要的。这样就可能使他们在很年青的时候就达到科学的高峰。
    新华社21日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联最高苏维埃会议今天通过了一项完全赞同苏联政府外交政策的决议。苏联最高苏维埃完全支持布尔加宁致各国政府首脑的信中和苏联政府给联合国会员国的照会中所提出的建议。
    决议指出，这些建议符合于缓和国际紧张局势、停止冷战和军备竞赛的任务，符合于扩大各国间的和平合作的任务。
    苏联最高苏维埃认为，在军备竞赛、特别是原子武器和氢武器方面的军备竞赛仍然继续进行的情况下，必须采取各种措施来制止事件朝危险的方向发展，并且保卫和平事业。采取如下步骤就会符合这一目的：
    拥有原子武器和氢武器的大国——苏联、美国和英国不使用这些类型的武器；
    苏联、美国和英国承担义务从1958年1月1日起停止原子武器和氢武器的一切试验；
    苏联、美国和英国达成协议，不在东德和西德领土上配置任何类型的核武器，接受波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和德意志民主共和国提出的关于不在这些国家和西德领土上生产和配置核武器的建议；
    大大裁减各国、而首先是裁减拥有最强大武装力量的各大国的武装部队人数和军备；
    达成关于北大西洋联盟参加国和华沙条约参加国互不侵犯的协议；
    就不采取任何会破坏中近东国家独立的措施和在解决同这个地区有关的问题时不使用武力一事达成协议；
    仍然在进行战争宣传的那些国家应该停止这种宣传，竭力扩大国际贸易和各国之间的科学文化联系。
    决议说，苏联最高苏维埃确信，大国领导人的直接接触和他们对迫切的国际问题的讨论，将会有助于寻求通向缓和当前国际紧张局势的道路和加强国际间的互相信任。
    决议指出，在目前世界局势中，即存在着资本主义国家和社会主义国家的情况下，任何想用外力改变这种局势的企图、想用干涉别国内政的方法改变政治制度的企图以及想强迫变更领土和破坏现状的企图，都将会使世界和平遭到悲惨的后果——这一事实得到了越来越广泛的承认。
    决议认为，北大西洋公约组织会议的决定证明，这个组织的领导国家打算继续执行危害和平事业的政策。鉴于北大西洋联盟参加国领导人曾经声明这些国家主张不对其他国家使用武力，苏联最高苏维埃愿意对于巩固和平和创造各国人民之间的信任气氛做出新的重要贡献，因此在本决议中委托苏联政府研究进一步裁减苏联武装部队的问题，将余下的、能够充分保证苏联的国防利益的武装部队数目和军备保持在必要水平上，直到达成国际裁军协定。苏联最高苏维埃希望，美国、英国和法国在裁减武装部队方面也采取步骤，从而对建立真正国际安全的事业做出贡献。
