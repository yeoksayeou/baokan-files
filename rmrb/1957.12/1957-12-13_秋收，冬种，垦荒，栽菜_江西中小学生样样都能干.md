　　Autumn Harvest, Winter Planting, Land Reclamation, Vegetable Growing
　　Jiangxi Primary and Secondary School Students Can Do It All
　　(Our Newspaper News) Middle and primary schools in various parts of Jiangxi Province have generally attached importance to organizing students to participate in physical labor. Currently, many schools have students going to the countryside to help agricultural cooperatives with the autumn harvest and winter planting; many schools have responded to the call for running schools diligently and thriftily, and are actively participating in labor such as school construction, land reclamation, vegetable growing, and road repair.
　　More than 3,000 students from Nanchang No. 1 Middle School, No. 7 Middle School, No. 8 Middle School, and No. 9 Middle School organized a labor force during the busy farming season to go to the suburbs to help agricultural cooperatives with the autumn harvest. Yongxin Middle School took four days of agricultural leave to allow students to actively participate in the autumn harvest. Many ripe rice crops in Yichun Farm were not harvested on time, so Yichun No. 2 Junior Middle School dispatched more than 200 people to harvest more than 70 mu in three and a half hours.
　　Under the call of "building the country diligently and thriftily, running schools diligently and thriftily," many students actively participated in school construction activities. More than 1,500 students from Yongxiu Middle School used their spare time to build an 8,970-square-meter sports field. Yu Gan Middle School organized all students to clean the streets. Students from Guixi Middle School and Dayuan Primary School in Wannian County used their spare time to carry bricks and tiles to build auditoriums and new school buildings. Many students also organized haircutting groups and laundry groups, etc. The past phenomenon of students wasting in life has also been greatly reduced.

    秋收，冬种，垦荒，栽菜
    江西中小学生样样都能干
    本报讯　江西省各地中、小学校都普遍重视了组织学生参加体力劳动。目前已有许多学校的学生到农村去帮助农业社秋收、冬种；许多学校的学生响应了勤俭办校的号召，积极参加了建校、垦荒、栽菜、修路等劳动。
    南昌一中、七中、八中、九中等四个学校的三千多名学生，在农忙时间，组织了一支劳动队伍，到郊区去帮助农业社秋收。永新中学放了四天农忙假，让学生积极参加秋收劳动。宜春农场许多黄熟的稻谷没有按时收割，宜春第二初级中学就出动了二百多人，利用三个半小时的工夫，收割了七十余亩。
    许多学生在“勤俭建国，勤俭办校”的号召下，积极参加了建校活动。永修中学一千五百多名学生利用课余时间修建了一个八千九百七十平方公尺的运动场。余干中学组织全体学生打扫街道。贵溪中学、万年县大源小学学生利用课余时间搬运砖瓦，修建大礼堂、新校舍。还有不少学生组织了理发小组、洗衣小组等。过去学生在生活上的浪费现象，现在也减少了许多。
