Xinhua News Agency, 17th: Xinhua News Agency reporter reports: The state-owned Xiangjiang Machine Factory recently submitted a report to the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party regarding the factory's handling of the employee family dormitory problem. The report stated that at the beginning of this year, the Xiangjiang Machine Factory applied to the state for the construction of 30,000 square meters of new family dormitories; the state approved the factory to build 10,666 square meters, with an investment of 550,000 yuan. After the Xiangjiang Machine Factory adopted various measures, the original application to the state for the construction of 30,000 square meters of family dormitories (including those already approved by the state) was cancelled, thereby saving the state a large amount of funds, and the problem of the shortage of employee family dormitories was basically resolved.

According to the reporter's understanding from relevant sources, the problems that existed in the Xiangjiang Machine Factory regarding employee family dormitories also exist in many factories and mining enterprises across the country. Therefore, the factory's methods or experiences in solving this problem have important reference value for factories and mining enterprises in solving the same problem.

The Xiangjiang Machine Factory has more than 70,000 square meters of employee dormitories, of which more than 55,000 square meters are permanent family dormitories newly built by the state for workers after 1952. The number of employees living in family dormitories accounts for about 60% of the total number of employees. This proportion has reached the quota set by the state in the first Five-Year Plan regarding this aspect (60% of employees with dependents, with each employee occupying an average of 20 square meters of building area). However, the employee family dormitories in the factory are still very tight. According to statistics in March of this year, a total of 442 employee households in the factory requested family dormitories. Among them, 127 households applied to bring their families to the factory and requested housing; 89 households had already brought their families to the factory and were waiting for dormitory allocation; 34 households were working couples in the factory who were married or urgently awaiting marriage or the woman was pregnant and requested a dormitory. In addition, 86 households living in temporary dormitories requested permanent dormitories; 23 households living in rented private housing requested public housing; and 83 households complained about overcrowding and requested readjustment. As a result, everyone was talking about it, complaining that the leadership was not solving practical problems; the leadership also believed that the employees' above-mentioned requests were reasonable, and believed that "too few houses were built." Therefore, they submitted a plan to the state to build another 30,000 square meters of housing. Although the state approved 10,666 square meters, the factory leadership still felt that it could not solve the housing shortage problem.

At this time, Liu Shaoqi, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, came to the factory to inspect work. Based on the actual situation of the factory, Liu Shaoqi gave instructions on solving this problem. At this time, the factory's leading cadres realized that the reasons for the dormitory shortage should be specifically analyzed, and the problem should be solved by following the mass line in accordance with the spirit of building the country through diligence and thrift.

After making a specific analysis of the dormitory shortage situation, the Xiangjiang Machine Factory found that it was not "too few dormitories were built," but because: (1) The factory unilaterally took care of employee welfare, the rent was too low, the electricity in the dormitory was only charged one-third of what it should have been, and water and furniture were not charged. As a result, it encouraged employees to demand too many, too good, and too urgent family dormitories, and made the state spend 139,000 yuan on subsidizing rent and utilities last year alone. (2) The factory lacked experience in managing dormitories and had not established a complete and strict system. In the past few years, many employee family members who should not have come to the factory moved to the factory. The number of non-direct relatives of employees who moved to the factory reached 391, occupying more than 2,000 square meters of dormitories. At the same time, the allocation of houses was not reasonable enough, and some cadres had too much housing, which was also a reason for workers to have opinions on the leadership. (3) The state's policy of preventing the blind influx of agricultural population into factories was not well publicized and implemented. At present, about 500 employee households in the factory have family members who are members of agricultural cooperatives. They have houses in the countryside and are much-needed labor force for agricultural cooperatives. These people can live and work in the countryside and should not be provided with dormitories by the factory. (4) The factory's leading cadres had a supply-based or all-inclusive mentality, and lacked education on how employees should correctly treat welfare issues. Moreover, the leading cadres only saw the employees' request for dormitories, but did not consider whether the state's economic conditions should or could meet this request.

Based on the results of investigation and research and analysis, the Xiangjiang Machine Factory formulated five measures to solve the employee family dormitory problem:

(1) Rationally adjust dormitories. The method of adjustment is: the 173 households living relatively spacious in the factory, especially the cadres with relatively spacious dormitories, should take the lead in vacating the houses that should be vacated and distribute them to employees who urgently need houses. The result had a great impact. Families of 137 employees who could return to the countryside to participate in production were mobilized to return to their hometowns to produce. Those who had brought their families to the factory but did not meet the conditions for dormitory allocation were all sent back to their original places of residence by the employees. The housing problems of 71 households that met the conditions for residing in family housing but had not been allocated houses and those with special difficulties have been gradually resolved.

(2) Formulate a strict and reasonable dormitory management system. This is the fundamental way to solve housing difficulties by turning passive into active.

I. Cancel the regulations on priority allocation of dormitories according to job rank. However, those who enjoy excellent labor insurance benefits, or those who participated in the revolution before the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, or those who are injured on duty and enjoy disability benefits, can be given priority in allocating public dormitories.

II. Strictly stipulate the conditions for family members to live in the factory. Those who meet one of the following conditions shall not move their family members to the factory: non-direct relatives of employees, or although they are direct relatives, they are rural or urban laborers; those who have worked for less than five years; family members are in a city near the factory and transportation is convenient.

III. Since no more dormitories will be built in the future, the allocation of existing dormitories will be determined according to the order of registration and other conditions, and allocated as much as is available, and allocated whenever available.

IV. Strictly review and approve application procedures for housing. Those who have not obtained the "Factory Housing Allocation Preliminary Notice" shall not move their family members to the factory first.

(3) According to the standards for collecting rent issued by the State Council, with reference to the relevant regulations of the province and city where the factory is located and the experience of fraternal factories, a new standard for charging rent, water, electricity and furniture has been formulated to make the state achieve a balance of payments in this regard. According to the new standard, the rent is increased by an average of 67.8%, the electricity bill is increased by an average of 150%, and water and furniture are all charged.

(4) Organize employees to build their own dormitories. The Xiangjiang Machine Factory organized a "Self-Built Housing Committee" and formulated "Interim Measures for Self-Built Housing." In order to encourage employees to build their own dormitories, the conditions for allowing employees to build their own dormitories are stipulated to be lower than the conditions for allocating public dormitories. However, it cannot be stipulated that every employee can build their own dormitory unconditionally. Because this will also cause a blind influx of agricultural population and non-employee dependent direct relatives into the factory.

(5) A family guest house with 50 beds has been newly built as a temporary dormitory for family members of employees who do not live in the factory to visit relatives. The guest house implements a charging system. In this way, it not only takes care of the problem of employees' family members visiting relatives, but also does not cause the state to pay for it. Therefore, this method is also very popular among employees.

The adoption of these measures not only saved the investment originally planned for building new dormitories, but also basically solved the employees' dormitory problems that had not been solved for many years in the case of existing dormitories; improved the relationship between the leadership and the masses; and also improved the ideological consciousness of the employees. Because this approach to solving the dormitory problem is the most realistic and profound education for all employees in the factory on how to correctly treat the relationship between individual interests and national interests, as well as the relationship between current interests and long-term interests. Now, the employees all realize that "asking the state for everything" is wrong and is not the attitude of the masters.

The Xiangjiang Machine Factory began to formulate the above-mentioned measures in April of this year. After repeated investigation, research and revision, it began to implement them in October. The method used by the Xiangjiang Machine Factory to carry out this work is: "Rely on cadres, rely on organizations, mobilize the masses, and follow the mass line." First, a professional team was established, headed by the deputy director of the factory in charge of living welfare work. The task of this team is to conduct investigations and research, formulate standards for rent, water, and electricity charges, and related systems. Second, a conference of employee representatives was held to explain the reason why the factory would no longer build new dormitories, and criticized the emotions of demanding too much, too high, and too urgent for dormitories. At the same time, the employee representative conference elected a "Housing, Water, and Electricity Research Committee" with the participation of workers, staff, technicians, and leading cadres. This committee is entrusted by the employee representative conference to jointly formulate various relevant standards and systems with the administrative side. This committee can both collect the opinions of the masses and implement the opinions of the leadership. Third, according to the progress of the work, cadres' meetings attended by party branch secretaries, section chiefs, and workshop directors were successively held to mobilize, clarify the basic spirit of solving the dormitory problem, explain the tasks, and explain the methods. The importance and responsibility of these cadres in solving the dormitory problem are important factors for the smooth resolution of the problem. Fourth, various methods are used to publicize to the employee masses and solve the ideological problems of the masses.

The Xiangjiang Machine Factory has not completely completed the work of solving the employee family dormitory problem, and some problems are still being solved. The work of adjusting dormitories has not been completed. It is still necessary to continue to mobilize and educate those family members who should return to the countryside to produce and the employees who should vacate spacious rooms to return to their hometowns or vacate their houses. There are still a very small number of employees who believe that the charging standards are too high, some of whom are genuinely experiencing difficulties due to low income and large population; others are pretending to be miserable. The factory is prepared to provide relief and subsidies to those with difficulties; it is prepared to use debate methods to educate those who are pretending to be miserable. The main problem with self-built dormitories is that the work of the self-built committee cannot keep up with the requirements of the masses. There are now many employees applying to build their own dormitories. Due to the lack of unified planning of the "self-built area," there has been a phenomenon of random construction. The drawings, materials, loans, etc. required for employees to build their own dormitories have not been fully prepared. At the same time, according to the situation of employees building their own dormitories last year and this year, the Xiangjiang Machine Factory believes that the state should invest in the outdoor roads, lighting, pipelines and toilet projects of employees' self-built dormitories. Because these projects require a lot of money, employees cannot afford them individually. In addition, the Xiangjiang Machine Factory basically solved the employee family dormitory problem in this way, but factories and mines in the same region or the same management system as this factory have not done so, which will cause employees to compare welfare with other factories, and even affect the transfer of employees. Therefore, the Xiangjiang Machine Factory hopes that relevant departments will review their methods and formulate basically unified methods in the same region or the same management system as soon as possible.

    职工宿舍问题怎样合理解决？
    请看湘江机器厂的好经验
    根据勤俭建国精神和采取群众路线方法，合理调整宿舍，严格管理制度，重订收费标准，鼓励自建住宅，照顾家属探亲
    新华社17日讯　新华社记者报道：国营湘江机器厂最近给中共中央报告了这个厂解决职工家属宿舍问题的情况。报告中说，湘江机器厂今年年初曾向国家申请新建三万平方公尺的家属宿舍；国家批准这个厂新建一万零六百六十六平方公尺，投资五十五万元。湘江机器厂采取各种措施以后，原来向国家申请新建的三万平方公尺的家属宿舍（包括国家已批准建设的），都不再建设了，因此为国家节省了大量的资金，而职工家属宿舍紧张的问题，也基本上得到解决。
    据记者从有关方面了解，湘江机器厂在职工家属宿舍方面曾经存在的问题，在全国很多厂矿企业中也还都存在。因此，这个厂解决这个问题的办法或经验，对厂矿企业解决同样的问题有重要的参考意义。
    湘江机器厂现有七万多平方公尺职工宿舍，其中有五万五千多平方公尺是1952年以后国家给工人新建的永久性的家属宿舍。居住家属宿舍的职工占全体职工总数的60％左右。这个比例已经达到国家编制第一个五年计划时关于这方面的定额（带眷职工占60％，每个职工平均占建筑面积二十平方公尺）。但是，工厂里的职工家属宿舍依然十分紧张。据今年3月间统计，全厂要求家属宿舍的职工共四百四十二户。其中申请把家属接来工厂而要求房子的一百二十七户；已将家属接来工厂坐待分配宿舍的八十九户；在本厂工作的男女双方已结婚或急待结婚或女方已怀孕而要求宿舍者三十四户。另外还有八十六户住临时宿舍的要求给永久性的宿舍；二十三户自租民房居住者要求给公房；八十三户嫌住的拥挤要求重新调整。于是，大家议论纷纷，埋怨领导上不解决实际问题；领导方面也就认为职工上述要求都合理，认为“住宅建少了”。所以就向国家提出再新建三万平方公尺住宅的计划。虽然国家批准了一万零六百六十六平方公尺，但工厂领导方面还是感到不能解决住宅紧张的问题。
    正在这时，中共中央副主席刘少奇来到这个厂检查工作，根据工厂的实际情况，刘少奇对解决这一问题作了指示。这时，工厂的领导干部才认识到：对宿舍紧张的原因应进行具体分析，应根据勤俭建国的精神，用走群众路线的方法来解决问题。
    湘江机器厂对于宿舍紧张的情况作了具体分析后，发现不是“宿舍建少了”，而是由于：（1）工厂片面地照顾职工福利，房租收费过低，宿舍里的用电仅收应收的三分之一，水和家具都不收费。因而助长了职工对家属宿舍过多过好过急的要求，而且使国家去年一年用于津贴房租和水电的费用，就达十三万九千元。（2）工厂缺乏管理宿舍的经验，没有建立起完善而严格的制度。过去几年中很多不应来厂的职工家属迁来了工厂，仅是职工非直系亲属迁来工厂的人就达三百九十一人，占居宿舍达二千平方公尺以上。同时，房屋分配得不够合理，有些干部住房过宽，也是工人对领导有意见的一个原因。（3）对于国家防止农业人口盲目流入工厂的政策，没有很好地宣传和执行。目前全厂约有五百户职工的家属是农业合作社的社员，他们在农村有房子，是农业社很需要的劳动力，这些人可以在农村安居乐业，不应该由工厂供给宿舍。（4）工厂领导干部有供给制或包下来的思想，对于职工应如何正确地对待福利问题，缺乏教育。而且，领导干部只看到职工要求宿舍的一面，而没有考虑国家的经济条件是否应该或是否能够满足这种要求。
    湘江机器厂根据调查研究分析的结果，制定了解决家属宿舍问题的五项措施：
    （一）合理调整宿舍。调整的办法是：全厂住的较宽余的一百七十三户，特别是宿舍较宽余的干部，首先带头腾出应让出的房子，分给急需房子的职工。结果影响很大。全厂有一百三十七户职工的家属可以回农村参加生产，就动员回乡生产，已将家属接来工厂而不够分配宿舍条件者，一律由职工送返原籍。合乎居住家属住宅条件而尚未分给房子的七十一户和有特殊困难者，已逐步解决了他们的住房问题。
    （二）制定严格合理管理宿舍的制度。这是变被动为主动解决住宅困难的根本办法。
    一、取消按职务等级优先分配宿舍的规定。但享受优异劳动保险待遇者，或抗日战争胜利以前参加革命者，或因公受伤享受残废待遇者，可优先分给公家宿舍。
    二、严格规定家属入厂居住的条件。凡是具有下列条件之一者不得把家属迁来工厂。职工非直系亲属，或虽是直系亲属但却是农村或城市劳动力者。参加工作不满五年者。家属在本厂附近的城市而且交通便利者。
    三、由于今后不再建宿舍，因此对现有的宿舍的分配，决定按登记先后等条件，采取空多少分多少，何时有何时分的办法。
    四、严格申请住宅审查批准手续，未取得“工厂住宅分配预备通知单”者，一律不准先将家属迁来工厂。
    （三）根据国务院颁发的收房租的标准，参照工厂所在的省、市有关规定和兄弟厂的经验，制订了新的房租水电和家具收费标准，使国家在这方面收支平衡。按新标准，房租平均提高67.8％，电费平均提高150％，水和家具全部实行收费。
    （四）组织职工自建宿舍。湘江机器厂组织了“自建住宅委员会”，制定“自建住宅暂行办法”。为了鼓励职工自建宿舍，允许职工自建宿舍的条件规定得低于分配公家宿舍的条件。但也不能规定每个职工都无条件地可以自建宿舍。因为这样也会造成农业人口和非职工供养的直系亲属盲目流入工厂。
    （五）新建了五十个床位的家属招待所，作为不住工厂的职工家属来探亲的临时宿舍。招待所实行收费制度。这样，既照顾了职工家属探亲的问题，又不致使国家贴钱。因此，这个办法也很受职工的欢迎。
    采取这些措施，不仅节省了原来计划新建宿舍的投资，而且在现有宿舍的情况下，基本上合理地解决了长年没有解决的职工的宿舍问题；改善了领导方面同群众的关系；同时也提高了职工们的思想觉悟。因为这种解决宿舍问题的作法，对全厂职工是一次如何正确对待个人利益同国家利益以及当前利益同长远利益的最现实而深刻的教育。现在，职工们都认识到：“一切都伸手向国家要”的作法是不对的，是非主人翁的态度。
    湘江机器厂今年4月开始制定上述措施，经过反复调查、研究和修改，到10月份开始执行。湘江机器厂进行这一工作的方法是：“依靠干部，依靠组织，发动群众，走群众路线。”第一，首先成立了专业小组，由负责生活福利工作的副厂长负责。这个小组的任务是进行调查研究，制定房租、水、电收费标准和有关制度。第二，召开职工代表大会，说明本厂宿舍不再新建的道理，批判了对宿舍要求过多过高过急的情绪。同时，职工代表大会选出有工人、职员、技术人员和领导干部参加的“住宅、水、电研究委员会”。这个委员会受职工代表大会委托，同行政方面共同制定各项有关的标准和制度。这个委员会既能把群众的意见集中上来，又能把领导方面的意见贯彻下去。第三，根据工作的进展，相继召开党支部书记、科长、车间主任参加的干部会议，进行动员，明确解决宿舍问题的基本精神，交代任务，说清办法。这些干部对解决宿舍问题的重视和负责，是使问题顺利解决的重要因素。第四，采用各种方式对职工群众进行宣传，解决群众的思想问题。
    湘江机器厂在解决职工家属宿舍问题这一工作还没有彻底完成，有些问题还正在解决。调整宿舍的工作还没有进行完毕，对那些应回乡生产的家属和应腾出宽余的房间的职工，还需继续动员和教育他们回乡或腾出房子。还有极少数职工认为收费标准过高，其中有的是因收入少人口多而确实有困难；也有的是虚张叫苦。工厂对有困难者准备予以救济补助；对虚张叫苦者准备用辩论的方法进行教育。职工自建宿舍存在的问题，主要是自建委员会的工作跟不上群众的要求。现在职工申请自建宿舍者已有很多，由于没有统一规划“自建区”，因此出现了乱建的现象。职工自建宿舍所需的图纸、材料、贷款等，也未完全准备好。同时，根据去年和今年职工自建宿舍的情况，湘江机器厂认为职工自建宿舍室外的道路、照明、管道及厕所等工程，应由国家投资。因为这些工程用钱多，职工个人负担不起。另外，湘江机器厂是用这样的办法把职工家属宿舍问题基本解决了，但和这个厂在同一地区或同一个管理系统的厂矿还没有这样作，这就会引起职工们向其它厂比福利的思想问题，甚至影响职工的调动。因此，湘江机器厂希望有关部门审查他们的办法，并早日在同一地区或同一管理系统拟定基本统一的办法。
