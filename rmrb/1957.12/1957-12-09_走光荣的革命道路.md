　　Taking the Glorious Revolutionary Road
　　Delin
    The "December 9th" Movement, which holds important significance in the history of the Chinese revolution, has passed its twenty-second anniversary. The nation's intellectual youth and students cherish this glorious revolutionary holiday and are commemorating it with various practical actions.

    In the year of the "December 9th" Movement, our motherland was in a critical state of life and death. Truly, a powerful enemy pressed our borders, our rivers and mountains were shattered, traitors were in power, and the nation was in peril! At that time, the revolutionary intellectual youth, under the call and leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, fearing not the bloody suppression of the traitorous bandits, raised the banner of patriotism, bravely held demonstrations and marches, raised their arms and shouted the slogan "Resist Japan and Save the Nation," inspiring the hearts of the people across the country and initiating the prelude to the War of Resistance Against Japan. This was a concentrated manifestation of the patriotism and revolutionary spirit of China's revolutionary intellectual youth and students. Today, our era is vastly different from that of the past. We live and grow in a peaceful and happy environment, and we are working and studying to build a strong socialist country with modern industry, agriculture, and science and technology. However, for the revolutionary intellectual youth and students, the lofty patriotism and revolutionary spirit of the "December 9th" era must be well inherited and carried forward, transforming it into a great driving force for participating in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. Facts have proven that the vast majority of our generation of youth are willing and able to inherit and carry forward this glorious revolutionary tradition, and are worthy of being called the outstanding sons and daughters of the socialist motherland. However, it must also be seen that some young people, although they are already in the ranks of socialist revolution and socialist construction, their steps are not strong enough and their confidence is not firm enough. They look ahead and behind, and walk along hesitantly. There are still quite a few people who sing the tune of "only expert, not red" and "expert first, then red," and it is still quite common to haggle over status and treatment, fear hardship, and pursue enjoyment of life. In a word, the bourgeois individualistic ideology has become a serious obstacle for many young people to hesitate or even retreat. At present, the socialist torrent is surging forward with the force of overturning mountains and overwhelming seas. If we do not resolutely throw away this individualistic burden, we will not only fail to go with the flow, but also be in danger of being swept away by this powerful torrent! We must raise our heads and look forward: the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is united in building a magnificent communist mansion, the strength of socialism has surpassed the capitalist world, and the East Wind has prevailed over the West Wind. The launch of two artificial satellites not only shows that the Soviet Union has left the United States behind in science and technology, but also that it will soon catch up with and surpass the United States in terms of per capita production. Our party has issued a grand call to catch up with and surpass Britain in steel and other important industrial products in fifteen years. What a great and heroic era this is! Faced with such an era, all individualistic plans seem too trivial and too small. In order not to fail this era, and in order to be worthy of the revolutionary youth of the previous generation, we must be determined to transform ourselves, strive to eliminate bourgeois individualistic ideology, establish a communist outlook on life and world outlook, and train ourselves to become intellectuals of the working class, laying a brick and a stone in the great project of building a communist mansion.

    One of the best ways to transform and train ourselves is to participate in physical labor and take the road of integration with workers and peasants, which is also the glorious road taken by the revolutionary youth of the "December 9th" era. Now the storm of intellectual youth participating in physical labor has begun to form a wave, which is a gratifying and good thing. We also need to raise this wave even higher, and we must consolidate it, make it regular, and make it an important part of our lives that cannot be separated. However, some young comrades have some different opinions on this issue. They say that intellectual participation in physical labor is a "waste of talent," "overqualified," and that "physical labor is in conflict with the development of science and technology," and so on. Therefore, they lack enthusiasm and consciousness for this significant revolutionary action, and even have serious resistance. This shows that these comrades have a very wrong view of labor, especially physical labor, and it also shows that they do not yet have a pressing determination to transform and train themselves. One of the major characteristics of socialism is to regard labor as a glorious and heroic cause, and physical labor is the foundation of all labor, because it is the source of creating all material and spiritual wealth. Therefore, a person's attitude towards labor is an important measure of his attitude towards socialism. Participating in physical labor can enable us to unite with the broad masses of workers and peasants, become one with them, learn from their excellent revolutionary qualities, absorb the nourishment to transform and train ourselves, and increase our revolutionary feelings and establish the stand of the working class; participating in physical labor can also enable us to increase our production knowledge and practice and verify scientific and technological theories. Physical labor is the foundation for the development of all science and culture. Participating in physical labor not only does not conflict with the development of science and technology, but only by earnestly combining knowledge with labor can the development of science and technology find a rich source. May we take action, resolutely take the glorious road of the "December 9th" and combine with workers and peasants, and strengthen labor training!

　　走光荣的革命道路

    在中国革命历史上具有重要意义的“一二·九”运动已经二十二周年了，全国的知识青年和青年学生都很珍重这个光荣的革命节日，并且正在以各种实际行动来纪念。
    在“一二·九”当年，我们的祖国正处在危急存亡之秋，真是强敌压境，河山破碎，汉奸当道，家国危亡！那时的革命知识青年，在中国共产党的号召和领导下，不怕汉奸卖国贼的血腥镇压，举起爱国主义的大旗，英勇地举行了示威大游行，振臂高呼“抗日救亡”的口号，振奋了全国的人心，揭开了抗日战争的序幕。这是中国的革命知识青年和青年学生爱国主义和革命精神的集中表现。今天我们的时代已经和当年迥然不同，我们在和平幸福的环境中生活和成长，正在为建设一个具有现代化的工业、农业和科学技术的社会主义强国而劳动和学习。但是，对于革命的知识青年和青年学生来说，“一二·九”时代那种崇高的爱国主义和革命精神，必须要很好地继承和发扬，把它转化为参加社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大动力。事实证明，我们这一代的青年，绝大多数是愿意而且也能够继承和发扬这个光荣的革命传统的，是不愧为社会主义祖国的优秀儿女的。不过也要看到有些青年，虽然已经置身在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的行列中，但是步伐还不够雄健，信心还不够坚定；他们瞻前顾后，在那里踽踽而行。唱“只专不红”“先专后红”的调子的人也还不在少数，斤斤计较地位待遇、惧怕艰苦、追求生活享受的人也还相当普遍，一句话，资产阶级的个人主义思想，成了许多青年踟蹰不前甚至后退的严重障碍。目前社会主义的洪流，正以排山倒海之势奔腾前进，我们如果不坚决扔掉这个个人主义的包袱，不但不能顺流而下，而且有被这股强大的洪流卷没的危险！我们要抬起头来，看向前方：以苏联为首的社会主义阵营正在团结一致地建设瑰丽的共产主义大厦，社会主义的力量已经超过资本主义世界，东风已经压倒西风。两个人造卫星上了天，不但表明在科学技术上苏联已经把美国抛在后面，而且在按人口平均的生产量方面赶上和超过美国已经为期不远。我们的党已经发出了在十五年后，在钢铁和其它重要工业产品方面赶上和超过英国的雄伟号召。这是何等伟大何等豪迈的时代！面对着这样的时代，一切个人主义的打算，真是显得太琐屑太渺小了。为了不辜负这样的时代，也为了无愧于上一代的革命青年，我们必须要下定决心改造自己，努力清除资产阶级的个人主义思想，树立共产主义的人生观和世界观，锻炼成为工人阶级的知识分子，在建设共产主义大厦的伟大工程中奠下一砖一石。
    改造和锻炼的最好办法之一，便是参加体力劳动，走和工农相结合的道路，这也是“一二·九”时代的革命青年所走过的光荣道路。现在知识青年参加体力劳动的风暴已经开始形成浪潮，这是一件可喜的好事。我们还需要把这股浪潮掀得更高，并且要把它巩固下来，使之经常化，成为我们生活上不可分开的一个重要部分。但是，有些青年同志对这个问题却有一些不同的意见。他们说什么知识分子参加体力劳动是“浪费人材”、“大材小用”，“体力劳动和发展科学技术有矛盾”，等等。因而他们对这一个意义重大的革命行动缺乏积极性和自觉性，甚至有严重的抵触情绪。这表明这些同志对劳动特别是体力劳动的看法很不对头，同时也说明他们还没有迫切要求改造和锻炼自己的决心。社会主义的重大特征之一，就是把劳动看作是光荣豪迈的高尚事业，而体力劳动又是一切劳动的基础，因为它是创造一切物质财富和精神财富的源泉，所以一个人对劳动的态度如何，是测验他对社会主义的态度如何的一个重要标尺。参加体力劳动，可以使我们和广大的工人农民结合在一块，和他们变成一体，向他们学习优秀的革命品质，吸收改造和锻炼我们自己的养料，使我们增加革命的感情和建立工人阶级的立场；参加体力劳动，还可以使我们增长生产知识，实践和印证科学技术理论。体力劳动是发展一切科学文化的基础，参加体力劳动不但和发展科学技术没有矛盾，而且只有认真地把知识和劳动结合起来，科学技术的发展才会找到丰富的源泉。愿我们行动起来，坚决地走“一二·九”的和工农结合的光荣道路，加强劳动锻炼吧！
