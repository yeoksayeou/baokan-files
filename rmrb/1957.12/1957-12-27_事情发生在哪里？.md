    Where Did It Happen?
    Some of the People's Daily's news reports do not clearly state the location, making it difficult to know where the events took place after reading them. For example, the two news reports written by Comrade Jin Feng, "Sneakers and Oil Gourds" and "Refuting Old Man Zuo," published on November 17th and November 21st, reflecting the great debates in rural areas, do not specify the province, county, township, or commune where the events occurred. This makes it easy to think that they are works of fiction. If they were works of fiction, they should be placed on page eight, but these two news reports were placed on page two.
    In addition, some news reports only mention the commune name, township name, or county name, but people do not know which county or province they are in. I think that clearly stating the location in the news report can only be beneficial and not harmful.

### 事情发生在哪里？

    事情发生在哪里？
    人民日报有些通讯没有把地名交代清楚，读后不知道事情发生在哪里。如11月17日和11月21日发表的金凤同志所写的“球鞋和油葫芦”、“驳倒左老印”两篇反映农村大辩论的通讯，就因为没有写明事情发生在哪省哪县哪乡哪社，使人容易觉得这是文学创作。如果是文学创作就应该放在第八版，可是这两篇通讯都是放在第二版的。
    另外，有些通讯，只说社名、乡名或县名，但是人们不知道是在哪县或哪省。我想，在通讯中把地点交代清楚只有好处，没有坏处。
