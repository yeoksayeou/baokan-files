    Forty Years of Soviet Science
    Niesimiyangnuofu, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences

    These days, the Soviet people and all progressive humanity are celebrating the fortieth anniversary of the Great October Revolution, which marked a fundamental turning point in world history.
    All of us, the fortunate generation who have participated to varying degrees in the great cause of transforming our motherland, feel a justified pride in our country, which was the first to embark on the socialist path and has become a guiding light for the working people of the world. We are filled with pride for our Communist Party, for our great people, who through their heroic struggle and labor have opened a new era in human life.
    On the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the great socialist revolution, we cannot help but remember with gratitude Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, the leader of the October Revolution, the founder of the Communist Party and the Soviet state.
    The great Lenin creatively developed the theories of Marx and Engels, demonstrated the possibility of the victory of the proletarian revolution in one country, and formulated the strategy and tactics of this revolution. Following Lenin's teachings, under the leadership of the Communist Party, our people completed this revolution, which became a great turning point in human history.
    The tremendous achievements of the Soviet Union, People's China, and other socialist countries, the great results of the revolutionary struggles of the working masses under the leadership of the Communist and Workers' Parties, and the emergence of the new world socialist system are all brilliant examples of the realization of scientific theory. In the field of social science, Marxism-Leninism, for the first time, provided us with a complete unity of theory and practice. The October Revolution fundamentally changed the situation of science: science became an inseparable part of socialist construction. The strength of Soviet science lies in its close integration with industry and the entire national economy, and in its method of dialectical materialism.
    Without practice, the development of science is unimaginable. On the other hand, the utilization of the results of scientific work runs through every step of industrial development. Each step forward in production provides nourishment for science, raises more and more new questions for science, and promotes scientific progress. However, not all scientific departments can directly influence technology; they often influence the last link of the chain—a certain phenomenon in technology—by giving new development possibilities to various links of the entire chain through a series of scientific departments. There are many such examples in the development of many branches of mathematics.
    Our Academy of Sciences has always been a major center of advanced mathematical thought throughout its history. The works of the outstanding Russian mathematicians of the nineteenth century, Ostrogradsky and Chebyshev, left a profound impact on world science. Lobachevsky's research has also received universal recognition, although this recognition came later. In the works of Soviet scientists, number theory, probability theory, topology, the theory of differential equations, the theory of functions, and functional analysis, as well as other mathematical fields, have been further brilliantly developed.
    Currently, technological development has reached such a level that complex mathematical instruments must be used in any of its links.
    While achieving success in the field of classical mathematics, in recent decades, the development of axiomatic methods and theoretical functional methods has changed the face of many mathematical fields and created entirely new departments. The combination of classical theory with these new methods has transformed entire mathematical fields such as probability theory, algebra, and topology. The most important new mathematical fields, such as modern operator theory and mathematical logic, have emerged. Operator theory, like the theory of differential equations and probability theory, has become a basic mathematical tool in physics. The peaceful use of atomic energy, the automatic control of production processes, and the development of jet technology have posed completely new problems for mathematics. Soviet mathematicians are successfully studying some new departments, such as information theory and program theory for electronic computers. The successful manufacture of high-speed electronic computers has opened a new era for science and technology.
    Mechanics is closely integrated with mathematics, and mechanics widely uses mathematical methods. Theoretical mechanics, built on the basis of mathematical achievements, contains a series of derived mechanics departments. These derived mechanics departments themselves are directly related to technology and determine the rapid progress of technology. Technology itself, in turn, poses many new problems for science, prompting it to solve a series of problems with new methods. This is particularly evident in the fields of aviation and rocket technology, the development of which is closely related to scientific research in fluid mechanics.
    Zhukovsky's works are the theoretical basis for the aerodynamic design of aircraft.
    Chaplygin's gas flow theory played a significant role in overcoming the sound barrier in aircraft. Soviet scientists have made great achievements in the theory of transonic and supersonic flight.
    Modern rapid rocket technology owes much to its founder, the great self-taught scientist Tsiolkovsky. Soviet researchers have creatively developed and are still victoriously developing Tsiolkovsky's scientific legacy. The fast "Tu-104" jet aircraft is flying on various routes, and some new high-speed jet aircraft have also been manufactured. The successful manufacture of intercontinental ballistic missiles is a decisive stage. The launch of the first artificial earth satellite is a great victory for science.
    Without strong structures with minimal weight, it would be impossible to solve many problems of new technology. Therefore, science is required to propose new solutions to the elasticity, strength, stability, bearing capacity, deformability, and destruction conditions of structures. At the same time, it is also necessary to consider plasticity, the interaction between deformed elements and gas and liquid flows, high speed, temperature conditions, and so on. Soviet scientists have made fundamental contributions to the development of these aspects. Of particular note is the contribution of the Institute of Mathematics of the Georgian Academy of Sciences, represented by Muskhelishvili and his school, to the theory of elasticity.
    During the forty years of the Soviet regime, technology has made great progress. The power of hydraulic turbines and steam turbines has been greatly increased, the number of metal processing machine tools has been greatly developed, and the speed of metal cutting, rolling, forging, and heat treatment has also been increased a lot. The metallurgical industry has made a tremendous qualitative leap. The development of the mining industry is characterized by the comprehensive promotion of mechanized processes. The increase in oil extraction has led to the transition to deeper mining layers, while increasing the speed of drilling.
    Before the revolution, automation only began to be adopted in some electrical and thermal power installations, in the manufacture of individual metal processing machine tools, and in telephone stations. At present, automation in our country is being promoted in many industrial sectors at an increasing speed. From instruments for controlling individual units to complete automation including the entire process, from the simplest control problems of maintaining certain values constant to the manufacture of complex automation systems that ensure the optimal operation of the entire process under unmanned management, this is the path of automation development over the past forty years. The current task is to transition to the comprehensive automation of the entire process and to the complete automation of production enterprises.
    In modern natural science, physics occupies a dominant position. The main prospects for current technological progress depend largely on the achievements of atomic physics and nuclear physics. Although the physics of our motherland is proud of the names of Stoletov, Umov, and Lebedev, it should be admitted that the physics of our country only prospered in the Soviet era.
    Soviet theoretical physics has grown. In the early days of the Soviet regime, Soviet optics occupied a prominent position. Rozhdestvensky's work in Leningrad on anomalous color gradients in metal vapors is a model of the highest experimental skill. Mandelstam and Landsberg in Moscow, simultaneously with Raman in India, made a great discovery—the phenomenon of combined scattering of light, which later gained great significance in chemical research worldwide. Vavilov and his school pioneered the study of faint light phenomena and determined its basic laws.
    One of the most important achievements of Soviet physics is the discovery of the Vavilov-Cherenkov effect, which laid the foundation for superluminal optics. The theory of this effect established by Soviet scientists reveals the essence of electron radiation moving at superluminal speeds in a certain medium, and points out its importance to nuclear physics.
    From the beginning of the Soviet era, solid-state physics has developed, thanks to Joffe and his school. The semiconductors they started studying long ago are of paramount importance.
    Kurchatov's discovery of photoelectric phenomena has had a very important impact. Soviet researchers have made important achievements in ferromagnetism. One of the huge centers currently focusing on this research is the Ural Branch of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Zavoisky in Kazan was the first to experimentally discover a very wonderful phenomenon—paramagnetic resonance. This phenomenon has been widely and comprehensively developed worldwide and applied to nuclear physics, chemistry, and biology.
    The Institute for Physical Problems in Moscow and Kharkov has made great achievements in the study of low-temperature physics. The results of Kapitza and his companions' research on liquid helium revealed a fundamental phenomenon—the superfluidity of helium, established the theory of this phenomenon, and predicted and discovered the so-called second sound in liquid helium.
    The achievements of Popov's great discoveries—radio engineering and electronics—have completely penetrated the life of the twentieth century, not only fundamentally changing science and technology, but also fundamentally changing daily life.
    The needs of radio communication have led to the necessity of studying radio wave propagation. It is conceivable that artificial earth satellites will help solve this problem in many ways. A great deal of work has been done in the study of short waves and later ultra-short waves. In this regard, Mandelstam and Papalexi's work on measuring the speed of radio wave propagation is of fundamental significance.
    However, no matter how great all these achievements are, current advances in the study of the atomic nucleus are still of primary significance to physics. It is this nuclear physics, which plays a decisive role in enhancing human power, that occupies the first place in modern natural science.
    Frenkel's droplet model of the atomic nucleus has had a great influence on the development of our understanding of the atomic nucleus, and this droplet model has been further developed in the theory of nuclear fission. Tamm was the first to propose the concept of nuclear forces arising from the exchange of light particles.
    1932 marked the beginning of a completely new stage in the development of nuclear physics. At that time, the first charged particle accelerator was successfully manufactured and the neutron was discovered. This discovery made it possible to carry out research on nuclear reactions occurring under the action of neutrons.
    As a result of research on artificial radioactivity produced by the capture of neutrons by the nuclei of various elements, Kurchatov and his companions discovered the isomeric nature of the nuclei of artificial radioactive elements in 1935.
    Our science has also played a significant role in the study of heavy nuclear fission and nuclear chain reactions.
    Our scientific and technological achievements in formulating new acceleration principles and manufacturing powerful "basic" particle accelerators are also undeniable.
    The study of cosmic rays is of particular significance to nuclear physics and theoretical physics.
    Soviet physicists have solved a series of the most important technical problems related to the use of atomic energy. In the Soviet Union, industrial atomic energy power stations have been working successfully for several years, and huge plans for building large atomic energy power stations are being implemented.
    Among the issues related to the peaceful use of atomic energy, in recent years, the possibility of establishing controllable thermonuclear reactions has attracted great attention. In this regard, some Soviet physicists have obtained many valuable theoretical and experimental data. For the first time in the laboratory, a temperature exceeding one million degrees was obtained by concentrating the discharge under the action of its own magnetic field.
    Soviet scientists have successfully carried out large-scale experiments in reactor physics and other problems of reactor construction. As a result of these works, a series of experimental and power nuclear reactors have been established. This has made it possible to organize the production of radioactive isotopes in our country, and radioactive isotopes have been widely used as penetrating radiation sources and "tracer" atoms in many aspects. Science has obtained powerful research tools.
    There is every reason to expect that due to the establishment and organization of the Siberian Branch of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Soviet science will be further strengthened, especially rapidly in physics and mathematics.
    Due to the great scientific achievements of physics, mechanics, electrical engineering, thermal physics, combustion physics, and other scientific departments, rapid progress has been made in modern turbine generator manufacturing and boiler manufacturing, in greatly increasing the voltage, distance, and power of transmitting electricity, and in the automation of technological processes.
    The modern achievements of physics and radio engineering have had a huge impact on the development of astronomy. In recent decades, we have seen the rapid development of astrophysics. The astrophysicists of the Crimean Observatory and the Byurakan Astrophysical Observatory of the Armenian Republic Academy of Sciences, led by Ambartsumian, have made particularly significant achievements. The Almaty Observatory of the Kazakh Academy of Sciences has also made great achievements. Summarizing our knowledge of the dynamics and physical characteristics of stars, our astronomers are able to conclude that stars are constantly forming in our Milky Way.
    Soviet chemistry has a glorious tradition. Simply mentioning Mendeleev, Zinin, and Butlerov is enough to illustrate this situation.
    Chemistry, with a good foundation, has developed by leaps and bounds in the Soviet era. Chemistry has been richly nourished by the rapidly developing chemical industry, which was virtually non-existent in pre-revolutionary Russia. Kurnakov's physical-chemical analysis method has been widely adopted. The complex compound chemistry school founded by Chugaev is of great significance.
    The Radium Institute, under the leadership of Khlopin and his students, carried out large-scale and significant labor, they first laid the scientific foundation for the creation of radium and natural radioactive elements, and later, in cooperation with other scientific institutions, laid the scientific foundation for the artificial radioactive element and fission material industry.
    Here, we can also mention many other works of inorganic chemistry and industry that are of great significance to the chlorine, fertilizer, and sulfuric acid industries, the establishment of our optical glass and chemical glass industries, the development of concrete production, refractory materials, and other silicate industries.
    Among the Soviet works in chemistry, perhaps the most influential for natural science is the chain reaction theory established by Semenov and his students, especially the theory of branched chain reactions.
    In organic chemistry, the unique discovery of synthetic rubber by Lebedev and his students has had the most direct and rapid impact on the development of industry. These works were produced on the basis of the long-term research of Favorsky and his school on unsaturated hydrocarbons, especially conjugated hydrocarbons. Lebedev was Favorsky's best student.
    Zelinsky and his school's research on the catalytic changes of hydrocarbons for forty years is one of the works of greatest significance. Basic work in petrochemistry and petroleum refining has been completed.
    Soviet scientists actively participated in the creation of new departments of organic chemistry—fundamental organic chemistry and its metal-organic chemistry. Scientists from Moscow, Kazan, Leningrad, and Gorky have discovered many new forms and functions of these substances. Their research clarifies several fundamental problems in chemistry and lays the foundation for new production. The fundamental and rich research work of Arbuzov and his Kazan school on organophosphorus chemistry is of particularly great significance.
    In the world of organic chemistry, the study of natural organic compounds occupies a large proportion. We are proud that the Orekhov school has conducted research on plant alkaloids commonly found in our country's plant raw materials. Now the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Uzbekistan has become the center for the study of plant alkaloids.
    Biology is one of the most complex and meticulous scientific departments. It is closely related to the national economy and healthcare. Biologists have widely launched research work, and they are increasingly absorbing the methods and ideas of mathematics, physics, and chemistry.
    As early as the early years of the Soviet regime, under the leadership of Bakh, biochemistry began to develop rapidly, and independent disciplines such as biophysics and radiobiology appeared.
    In our country, the chemical actions of organism movement, nerve activity, and muscle activity have been studied, and the relationship between chemical actions and muscle mechanical movements has been determined. Scientists from the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Ukraine, under the leadership of Palladin, have determined the relationship between the functional state of the brain and the enzymatic activity of the brain.
    Due to the work of the great physiologist Pavlov, Soviet physiology is at the forefront of world science. At present, Pavlov's legacy is being continued and developed by his students and successors, who have established new directions in physiology. Obel's research on the functions of the sympathetic nervous system is also very remarkable.
    Soviet botany is developing victoriously and effectively. The Michurin school, which has developed directly and closely in conjunction with agricultural practice, is of great significance in Soviet biology.
    Lysenko created the theory of stage development. This theory has had a great influence on the physiology of plants. He determined the physiological essence of various genders of cereals and many other crops.
    Tsitsin studied the problem of distant hybridization of plants.
    It should be particularly pointed out that the work done in the Soviet Union on the origin of life on Earth has received a great response, especially at the international discussion held in Moscow not long ago.
    In the past forty years, great achievements have been made in geological and geographical sciences. The rich legacy left by past great explorers illustrates this point, from Lomonosov to Karpinsky, Vernadsky, and Obruchev. Geology has undergone profound differentiation, and new disciplines have been separated and formed.
    It is particularly significant that Vernadsky's concept of geochemistry has penetrated into geology and profoundly transformed it. The emergence and development of geochemistry and its branches—biogeochemistry and radiogeochemistry—are a great contribution of Soviet science.
    The geological research of Soviet territory has been greatly improved. Geological prospecting is being carried out in vast areas. There are no more "blank spots." The geological map of the Soviet Union has been compiled.
    Particular note should be taken of the comprehensive research work on mineral layers, as well as the research work on the material structure and properties of new mineral raw materials.
    Due to Fersman's extensive investigation and research on the natural resources of the Kola Peninsula, mines, factories, and scientific research institutions have sprung up in the formerly uninhabited frozen soil zone. The scientific research of the geologists of Kazakhstan, headed by Satpayev, has made Kazakhstan occupy a leading position in the production of non-ferrous metals. The discovery of the most abundant diamond deposits in Yakutia is a great achievement of Soviet geologists.
    Gubkin elucidated the basic principles of oil origin. The discovery of huge oil and natural gas deposits in the Caucasus, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, the Emba region, and the Carpathian Mountains, and, in particular, the fact that the central part of the country between the Urals and the Volga River is now a huge major oil area, should be particularly emphasized.
    In the field of soil science, significant achievements have been made in the study of the origin and properties of soils (which is the basis for taking measures to rationally utilize soils and improve soil fertility). Here, it should be pointed out the work of the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Latvia in studying the effect of trace elements on soils.
    While natural sciences and technical sciences faithfully and effectively serve the material progress of our country, social sciences are our ideological weapon.
    Economics has helped the Party to clarify the roads and methods of industrialization and agricultural collectivization. The works of economists have promoted the socialist transformation of the economy.
    Philosophy has effectively helped to carry out communist education for the working people in the fierce ideological struggle against various bourgeois viewpoints and opportunist viewpoints.
    Under the Soviet regime, the forty-eight nationalities of the Soviet Union have their own writing for the first time in the entire history of their development. This fact is a vivid example of the victory of the Communist Party's Leninist national policy. Soviet linguistics has also played a great role in this regard.
    Our historians have studied many important issues of the present age. The achievements of our archaeologists are also very significant.
    In the peaceful economic competition between the socialist and capitalist systems, science plays an important role. The socialist mode of production and the maximum use of science can realize a production revolution. Here, we are referring first of all to the revolution in power industry. The revolution in the production of machines and materials based on the widest use of automation and the organization of continuous production will be of equal importance.
    At the same time, we can anticipate that events of great revolutionary significance will occur in the field of biology, that is, in the study of the basic activities of organisms, in the study of the physical and chemical phenomena of these activities at the cellular level, and in the study of these phenomena at the level of biological tissues and organs. We can expect that humans will be able to deeply understand and influence biological phenomena such as heredity, reproduction, cell division, the normal and pathological tissue composition, and the physical and chemical functions of tissues. All these open up new and unprecedented possibilities for medicine and agriculture.
    Humanity's aspiration to develop upwards into the sky, to go beyond the Earth's surface and atmosphere, has led to the first cosmic flight, which is a precursor to humanity's flight to the still-mysterious world of the Moon and other planets. Due to the creation of powerful astronomical instruments, the scope of the observable universe has expanded many times, and it is possible to study this vast cosmic laboratory in depth.
    Manufacturing new powerful accelerators can allow us to discern the original composition of matter and the secrets of the relationship between matter and energy.
    The great work program put forward by the historic resolution of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union stipulates the future path of our country's advance towards communism. To fully participate in the completion of this magnificent program is the glorious cause of scientific workers.
    As we look back with pride on the glorious path that the Soviet state has traversed in the past forty years, we are filled with determination to dedicate all our knowledge and ability to the great cause of communism and peace throughout the world.

    苏联科学的四十年
    苏联科学院院长　涅斯米扬诺夫
    这些日子里，苏联人民和全体进步人类都在庆祝标志着世界历史根本转折点的伟大的十月革命四十周年。
    我们大家，我们这一代在不同程度上参加过改造我们祖国这种伟大事业的幸福的人，都为我们第一个走上社会主义道路并且成为全世界劳动人民的指路明灯的祖国而感到正当的自豪。我们为我们的共产党，为我们的伟大人民而充满自豪，他们以自己的英勇斗争和劳动给人类生活打开了新纪元。
    在伟大的社会主义革命四十周年之际，我们不能不带着感激的心情怀念十月革命的领袖、共产党和苏维埃国家的创始人——弗拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁。
    伟大的列宁创造性地发展了马克思和恩格斯的学说，论证了无产阶级革命在一个国家内胜利的可能性，并且制订了这个革命的战略和策略。我国人民遵循着列宁的教导，在共产党的领导下完成了这个成为人类历史上伟大的转折点的革命。
    苏联、人民中国和其他社会主义国家的巨大成就、劳动群众在共产党和工人党的领导下取得的革命斗争的伟大成果，新的世界社会主义体系的出现，这些都是科学理论实现的光辉范例。在社会科学方面，马克思列宁主义第一次给我们提供了理论和实践的完全统一。十月革命根本地改变了科学的情况：科学成了社会主义建设的不可分割的一部分。苏联科学的力量就在于它同工业和整个国民经济密切结合，就在于它的方法是辩证唯物主义。
    没有实践，科学的发展是不可想像的。另一方面，科学工作的成果的利用又贯穿到工业发展的每一步。生产每前进一步就给科学提供出养料，向科学提出越来越多的新问题，促使科学进步。然而并非所有科学部门都能直接影响技术，它们常常是通过一系列的科学部门，给整个链条的各个环节以新的发展可能性，从而影响链条的最后一环——影响技术上的某一现象。在数学许多部门的发展中就有很多这样的例子。
    我们的科学院在它的整个历史中一直是一个最大的先进数学思想的中心。十九世纪的杰出的俄国数学家奥斯特罗格拉德斯基和契贝谢夫的著作给世界科学留下了深远的影响。洛巴契夫斯基的研究也得到了普遍的承认，虽然这种承认比较迟一些。在苏联科学家的著作中，数论、概率论、拓扑学、微分方程理论、函数论和泛函分析及其他数学领域都得到了进一步的光辉发展。
    目前技术发展已经达到这样的水平，就是它的任何一个环节都必须采用复杂的数学仪器。
    在古典数学领域取得成就的同时，近数十年来，公理化的方法和理论的泛函方法的发展改变了很多数学领域的面貌，产生了完全新的部门。古典理论同这些新方法相结合就使得像概率论、代数、拓扑学这样一些数学领域整个改观。像现代运算子理论和数理逻辑这样的最重要的新数学领域兴起了。运算子理论同微分方程理论和概率论一样，成为物理学中的基本数学工具。原子能的和平利用、生产过程的自动控制和喷气技术的发展在数学面前提出了完全新的问题。苏联数学家正在顺利地研究一些新的部门，如电子计算机的信息论和程序理论。高速电子计算机的制造成功给科学和技术开辟了新纪元。
    力学是同数学密切结合的，力学广泛运用数学的方法。在数学成就的基础上建立起来的理论力学，包含有一系列派生的力学部门。这些派生的力学部门本身同技术有直接联系并且决定着技术的迅速进步。而技术本身又给科学提出很多新问题，促使它以新的方法解决一系列的问题。在航空和火箭技术方面这种情况特别明显，这两个技术部门的发展同流体力学方面的科学研究密切相关。
    茹科夫斯基的著作是飞机空气动力设计的理论基础。
    在飞机克服声速障碍方面，恰普雷金的气流理论起了极大的作用。苏联科学家在跨音速和超音速飞行理论方面取得了巨大的成就。
    现代突飞猛进的火箭技术在很多方面都要归功于它的创始人——伟大的自学的科学家齐奥尔科夫斯基。苏联的研究人员过去创造性地发展了并且现在仍然在胜利地发展着齐奥尔科夫斯基的科学遗产。快速的“图——104”喷气机正在各航线上飞行，还制成了一些新式的高速喷气机。洲际弹道火箭的制造成功是一个决定性的阶段。第一颗人造地球卫星的发射是科学的伟大胜利。
    没有具有最小重量的牢固的结构，就不可能解决新技术的很多问题。因此要求科学对结构的弹性、强度、稳定性、承载能力、变形性及其破坏条件提出新的解决办法。同时还必须考虑到塑性、变形元件同气流和液流间的相互作用、高速、温度条件等。苏联科学家在这些方面的发展上作出了基础性的贡献。值得特别提出的，是格鲁吉亚科学院以穆斯赫利什维利及其学派为代表的对弹性理论的贡献。
    在苏维埃政权的四十年当中，技术有了长足的进步。水轮机和汽轮机的功率大大提高了，金属加工机床数量有了巨大发展，金属切削、压延、锻造和热处理的速度也提高了很多。冶金业有了巨大的质的跃进。采矿业的发展特征是全面推广机械化过程。石油开采量的增加引起了向更深的开采层的过渡，同时增加了钻探的速度。
    革命前自动化仅仅在一些电力装置和热动力装置中，在制造个别的金属加工机床和在电话站中开始采用。目前我国自动化正以日益增长的速度推广到很多工业部门中去。从控制个别机组的仪器到包括整个工艺过程的全盘自动化，从保持某些数值恒定的最简单的控制问题到制造保证在无人管理情况下整个过程最佳运转的复杂的自动化系统，这就是四十年来自动化的发展道路。当前的任务是，过渡到整个过程的综合自动化，过渡到生产企业的全盘自动化。
    在现代的自然科学中，物理学占主导地位。目前技术进步的主要前景在很大程度上取决于原子物理学和原子核物理学的成就。虽然我们祖国的物理学以斯托列托夫、乌莫夫、列别杰夫这些人的名字而感到骄傲，但是应当承认，我国的物理学只有在苏维埃时代才得到了繁荣。
    苏联的理论物理学成长了。在苏维埃政权初期苏联的光学占据了杰出的地位。列宁格勒的罗日杰斯特文斯基关于金属蒸汽中的反常色敬的著作是最高试验技巧的典范。莫斯科的曼杰利什塔姆和兰德斯别尔格同印度的拉曼同时作出了一个巨大的发现——光的并合散射现象，后来这种并合散射现象在全世界的化学研究中获得十分重大的意义。瓦维洛夫和他的学派首创地研究了微光现象，确定了它的基本规律。
    苏联物理学的最重要的成就之一是瓦维洛夫—契连科夫效应的发现，这个发现给超光速光学奠定了基础。苏联科学家所创立的这个效应的理论揭示了在一定介质中以超光速运动的电子辐射的实质，指出了它对原子核物理的重要性。
    从苏维埃时代一开始，固体物理就有了发展，这方面要归功于约费和他的学派。他们很早以前就开始研究的半导体具有极为重要的意义。
    库尔查托夫关于光电现象的发现起了非常重要的影响。苏联研究人员在铁磁性方面取得了重要成就。目前集中进行这种研究的巨大中心之一是苏联科学院乌拉尔分院。喀山的扎沃伊斯基首先在实验中发现了一个很奇妙的现象——顺磁谐振。这种现象在全世界得到了广泛的全面发展，并且应用到原子核物理、化学和生物学方面去。
    莫斯科和哈尔科夫的物理问题研究所在研究低温物理方面取得了很大成就。卡皮查和他的同伴研究液态氦的结果，发现了根本性的现象——氦的超流动性，建立了这个现象的理论，预见和发现了液态氦中的所谓次音。
    波波夫位大发现的成果——无线电工学和电子学已经完全渗入到二十世纪的生活中，它们不仅根本地改变了科学和技术，而且也根本地改变了日常生活。
    无线电通信的需要引起了研究无线电波传播的必要性。可以想像，人造地球卫星会在许多方面有助于这个问题的解决的。在研究短波以及后来的超短波方面曾经进行了大量工作。在这方面曼杰尔斯塔姆和帕帕列克西关于测量无线电波传播速度的著作具有原则性的意义。
    但是，不论所有这些成就如何伟大，目前在研究原子核方面的进展仍然对于物理具有主要意义。正是这种论定在提高人类威力方面起决定性作用的原子核物理，在现代自然科学中占首位。
    弗连克·利提出的原子核的液滴模型对于发展我们对原子核的认识有极大的影响，这种原子核的液滴模型在核分裂理论中得到了进一步的发展。塔姆第一个提出了由于轻粒子交换的结果而产生核子力的概念。
    1932年开始了原子核物理发展的完全新的阶段。当时制造成功了第一台带电粒子加速器并且发现了中子。这个发现使得有可能实现研究在中子作用下所发生的核反应。
    由于对各元素原子核捕获中子而产生的人为放射性进行研究的结果，1935年库尔查托夫和他的同伴发现了人为放射性元素的原子核的同质异能性。
    在研究重核分裂和原子核链式反应方面我国科学所起的作用也不小。
    在拟订新的加速原则和制造强大的“基本”粒子加速器方面，我们科学和技术的成就也是无可怀疑的。
    宇宙线的研究对于原子核物理和理论物理具有特别的意义。
    苏联的物理学家解决了一系列有关利用原子能的最重要的技术问题。在苏联，工业用原子能发电站已经顺利地工作了好几年，并且正在实现建设大型原子能发电站的巨大计划。
    在有关和平利用原子能的问题当中，近年来关于可能建立可控制的热核反应问题引起了很大的注意。在这方面，一些苏联物理学家获得了很多有价值的理论和实验资料。在试验室里第一次通过在本身磁场作用下的放电集中获得了超过一百万度的温度。
    苏联科学家在反应堆物理和建设反应堆其他问题方面顺利地进行了大规模的试验。这些工作的结果，建立了一系列的试验用和动力用的核反应堆。这样就能够在我国组织放射性同位素的生产，放射性同位素作为穿透性辐射源和“示踪”原子得到了多方面的广泛应用。科学得到强有力的研究工具。
    完全有根据预料，由于苏联科学院西伯利亚分院的建立和组织，苏联科学在物理数学方面会得到特别迅速的进一步的加强。
    由于物理学、力学、电工学、热物理学、燃烧物理学和其他科学部门的巨大科学成就，在现代涡轮发电机制造业和锅炉制造业中，在大大提高输送电力的电压、距离和功率方面，在工艺过程自动化方面都取得了飞快的进步。
    物理学和无线电工学的现代成就对天文学的发展起了巨大的影响。最近数十年来，我们看到了天体物理学的突飞猛进的发展。克里米亚天文台和阿姆巴楚米扬所领导的亚美尼亚共和国科学院比尤拉坎天文台的天体物理学家取得了特别重大的成就。哈萨克科学院的阿拉木图天文台也取得了很大的成就。总结了我们关于星球动力学和物理特点的知识，我们的天文学家就能够得出在我们的天河中星球不断形成的结论。
    苏联的化学有着光荣的传统。只要提起门德雷叶夫、津宁和布特列罗夫就完全能够说明这种情况。
    具有良好基础的化学，在苏维埃时代，得到飞跃的发展。化学从迅速发展的化学工业中得到了丰富的滋养，而在革命前的俄国，化学工业实际上是没有的。库尔纳科夫的物理—化学分析方法得到了广泛的采用。丘加也夫创立的络合物化学派，具有重要的意义。
    拉季耶夫研究所在赫洛平和他的学生领导下进行了大规模的意义重大的劳动，他们首先给创立镭和天然放射性元素打下了科学基础，以后同其他科学机构合作给人为放射性元素和分裂物质工业打下了科学基础。
    这里还可以提一下无机化学和工业方面很多其他对于氯、肥料、硫酸工业具有重要意义的工作，我国光学玻璃和化学玻璃工业的建立，混凝土生产、耐火材料和其他矽酸盐工业的发展。
    在苏联在化学方面的著作中，对于自然科学最有影响的也许要算谢苗诺夫和他的学生所创立的链式反应学说，特别是分支链式反应的学说。
    在有机化学中，列别杰夫和他的学生对合成橡胶的独特发现对于发展工业具有最直接和最迅速的影响。这些著作是在法沃尔斯基和他的学派长期研究不饱和烃、特别是偶联键烃的基础上产生的。列别杰夫就是法沃尔斯基的最好的学生。
    泽林斯基和他的学派四十年来对碳氢化合物的催化变化的化学的研究是具有最巨大意义的工作之一。石油化学和石油提炼方面的基础工作已经完成。
    苏联科学家积极参加创立有机化学的新部门——基本有机化学和属于它的金属有机化学。莫斯科、喀山、列宁格勒和高尔基城的科学家都发现了这些物质的许多新形式和新功能。他们的研究阐明了化学的若干基本问题并且给新的生产奠定了基础。阿尔布佐夫和他的喀山学派的基础性的、内容丰富的有机磷化物化学的研究工作具有特别重大的意义。
    在世界有机化学中，天然的有机化合物的研究占极大比重。我们引以自豪的是，奥列霍夫学派对我国植物原料中常见的植物硷进行了研究。现在乌兹别克共和国科学院已成为植物硷研究工作的中心。
    生物学是最复杂、最细致的科学部门之一。它同国民经济和保健有密切联系。生物学者广泛地展开了研究工作，他们越来越多地吸收了数学、物理和化学的方法与观念。
    早在苏维埃政权的最初年代里，在巴赫的领导下生物化学就已经开始迅速发展，出现了生物物理学和放射生物学等独立的学科。
    在我国已研究出了有机体运动机能、神经活动和肌肉活动的化学作用，确定了化学作用和肌肉机械动作之间的关系。乌克兰共和国科学院的科学家在帕拉金的领导下，确定了脑的机能状态同脑的酵素活动性之间的关系。
    由于伟大的生理学家巴甫洛夫的工作，苏联生理学位于世界科学的前列。目前巴甫洛夫的遗产正在由他的学生和继承者继续向前发展，他们在生理学中建立了新的方向。奥别利在交感神经系统机能方面的研究也是很卓越的。
    苏联的植物学正在胜利地、有成效地发展着。直接密切结合农业实践而发展起来的米丘林学派，在苏联生物学中具有巨大的意义。
    李森科创立了阶段发育论。这一学说对植物的生理学起了很大影响。他确定了谷物和其它许多农作物各种性的生理本质。
    齐津研究了植物的远缘杂交问题。
    应当特别指出苏联在地球生命起源方面所做的工作，它已得到了很大的反响，特别是在不久前在莫斯科所举行的国际讨论会上。
    在过去的四十年里，在地质地理科学方面获得了很大的成就。过去的伟大考察家所遗留下来的丰富遗产就说明了这一点，这些研究家从罗蒙诺索夫起直到卡尔平斯基、维尔纳茨基和奥布鲁切夫。地质学发生了深刻的分化，分出了并形成了新的学科。
    维尔纳茨基所创立的地球化学的观念渗入到地质学中去并深刻地改造了它，这是特别有意义的。地球化学和它的分支——生物地球化学和放射地球化学的产生与发展是苏联科学的伟大功绩。
    对苏联领土的地质研究大大地提高了。广大地区都进行着地质勘探。“空白点”没有了。苏联的地质地图编制成了。
    特别应当指出的是对矿层的综合研究工作，以及对新矿物原料的物质构造和特性的研究工作。
    由于费尔斯曼开始对科拉半岛的自然富源进行了广泛的考察研究，在从前无人烟的冻土带兴起了矿山、工厂和科学研究机关。以萨特帕耶夫为首的哈萨克的地质学家们的科学研究，使哈萨克在有色金属的生产方面占据主要地位。在雅库特发现储量最丰富的金刚石矿床，是苏联地质学家们的巨大成就。
    古勃金阐明了石油起源的基本原理。在高加索、土库曼、乌兹别克、恩巴地区和喀尔巴阡山一带发现巨大的油矿和天然气矿藏，应当特别强调指出的是在乌拉尔和伏尔加河之间的全国中心部分是目前巨大的主要油区。
    在土壤学方面，在研究土壤的起源和性质（这是采取合理利用土壤和提高土壤肥力的措施的基础）方面取得了显著成就。这里应当指出的是拉脱维亚共和国科学院在研究微量元素对土壤的作用方面的工作。
    自然科学和技术科学忠实而有效地为我国的物质进步服务，而社会科学则是我国的思想武器。
    经济学帮助党阐明了工业化和农业集体化的道路和方法。经济学家的著作促进了经济的社会主义改造。
    哲学在同各种资产阶级观点和机会主义观点进行激烈的思想斗争中有效地帮助了对劳动人民进行共产主义教育。
    在苏维埃政权下苏联四十八个民族在它们发展的整个历史中第一次有了自己的文字。这个事实是共产党的列宁主义民族政策取得胜利的鲜明范例之一。苏联语言学也在这方面起了很大的作用。
    我们的历史学研究了现代许多重要的问题。我们的考古学家的成就也是很显著的。
    在社会主义和资本主义两种制度进行和平的经济竞赛中，科学具有重要的作用。社会主义生产方式和科学的最大限度的利用能够实现生产革命。这里指的首先是动力工业的革命。在最广泛地利用自动化和组织连续生产的基础上机器和材料生产中的革命将具有同样的重要性。
    同时我们可以预料，在生物学方面，即在研究生物的基本活动，在细胞的基础上研究这些活动的物理和化学现象以及在生物组织和器官的基础上研究这些现象的部门会发生具有重大革命意义的事件。我们可以指望人能够深入了解并影响如遗传、生殖、细胞分裂、正常和病态的组织构成以及组织的物理和化学机能这些生物现象。所有这些给医学和农业开辟了新的、空前未有的可能性。
    人类要求向上空发展，要求越出地球表面和大气层的志向导致第一次宇宙飞行，这是人类飞向现在仍然是神秘的月球和其他行星世界的预告。由于强有力的天文仪器的造成，可被观察到的宇宙的范围扩大了许多倍，并且有可能深入研究这个广阔的宇宙实验室。
    制造新的强有力的加速器能够洞察物质的原始组成和物质与能相互关系的秘密。
    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会历史性的决议所提出的伟大的工作纲领规定了我国向共产主义前进的未来道路。全力参与完成这一宏伟的纲领，是科学工作者们的光荣事业。
    当我们怀着自豪的心情回顾苏维埃国家四十年来所经历过的光荣道路时，我们满怀着决心，今后要把我们的全部知识和能力献给共产主义的伟大事业和全世界的和平。
