　　Busy Construction on the Xin'an River
    The first phase of the cofferdam dewatering project on the right bank riverbed, one of the main projects of the Xin'an River Hydropower Station, has been completed ahead of schedule. A "wooden city" composed of seventy-eight wooden cages, more than 530 meters long and more than ten meters high, has stood safely in the turbulent river. The large-scale foundation pit excavation project has begun in full swing. An army of workers equipped with various machinery is working hard to complete the task of excavating 240,000 cubic meters of foundation pit and pouring 30,000 cubic meters of concrete before March next year.

　　新安江上施工忙
    新安江水电站主体工程之一的右岸河床第一期围堰闭气排水工程已提前完成。一座由七十八只木笼组成的长五百三十多公尺、高十数公尺的“木城”已安然屹立在湍急的江中。大规模的基坑开挖工程全面开始了。一支由各种机械装备起来的劳动大军正在为争取到明年3月以前完成开挖二十四万立方公尺基坑、浇捣三万立方公尺混凝土的任务而努力。（附图片）
