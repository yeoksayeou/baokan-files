　　Welcome Hard-Currency Fen Coins and Ten-Yuan Notes
　　Family Woman from Hankou’s Poyang Street, Yang Nianfang
　　Hard-currency fen coins and ten-yuan notes were issued yesterday, and I welcome them!
　　We have been looking forward to hard-currency fen coins for many days now. The current paper fen notes, no matter how much we cherish them, are easily damaged because they circulate too much. When they’re damaged, dirty, or torn, they can no longer be used; it’s a pity to throw them away. At times like these, we always think: How great it would be if there were coins. It seems the government has read our minds, and sure enough, they’ve issued hard-currency fen coins.
　　I also hope the government will consider issuing hard-currency jiao coins in the future.
　　As for the ten-yuan note, although I don't use it much in my daily life, I believe this is because our industrial and agricultural production has developed, and the circulation of commodities has expanded, requiring a large denomination note. Speaking of large denomination notes reminds me of my memories before liberation. At that time, prices rose several times a day, and ten-thousand-yuan notes would become waste paper overnight if kept in hand. No one dared to keep them at home, and as soon as they got them, they had to rush to exchange them for silver dollars. Now, the prices of major commodities have remained stable for several years, and people don't have to worry about the price of firewood, rice, oil, and salt at all; the days of frantically rushing to exchange banknotes for silver dollars have long become a distant nightmare. Ten yuan will still be ten yuan after a year, it won't be less.
　　Therefore, the issuance of the ten-yuan note has become a sign of our country's great economic development and the great increase in people's purchasing power.

### 欢迎硬分币和十元券

　　欢迎硬分币和十元券
　　汉口鄱阳街家庭妇女　杨念芳
    硬分币和十元券昨天开始发行了，我欢迎它们！
    我们盼望硬分币，真是望了好多日子了。现在的纸分币，尽管我们怎么珍惜它，可是，因为流传的次数太多了，它总是容易坏，坏了、脏了、烂了，就没法再使；丢了吧，又可惜。这时候，我们总是在寻思：要是有硬币该多好啊。政府像是猜透人们的心思似的，果然就发行硬分币了。
    我还希望政府在将来能考虑再发行一种硬角币。
    至于十元券，虽然我日常用它不多，但是我相信这是由于我们的工农业生产发展了，商品的流通扩大了，需要有一种大票子。说起大票子，却勾起我解放前的记忆。那时候，物价一天涨几回，万元大钞留在手里，过一夜也会变成废纸，谁也不敢留在家里，一到手，就得赶紧换成银元。现在呢，主要商品大约有好几年没有涨价了，人们根本不用为柴米油盐的价格担心；捧着一叠钞票惊惊慌慌去抢兑银元的事，早已成了遥远的噩梦了。十块钱放上一年，还是十块钱，不会少一个。
    因此，十元券的发行，就成为我们国家经济大大发展、人民购买力大大提高的标志了。
