Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd: The new Japanese Ambassador to India, Nisu Hao, publicly made remarks through the reactionary Pan Asia News Agency in Tokyo on December 12th, provoking the relationship between China and India and supporting the United States' occupation of China's territory Taiwan and the conspiracy to create "two Chinas."

Nisu Hao believes that the so-called Taiwan issue can be resolved under such circumstances, namely, by "establishing a 'United States of China' or 'Federation of China' including Taiwan, where the local government of Taiwan can maintain its own policies." Nisu Hao's remarks are a disguised presentation of the U.S.-made conspiracy of so-called "two Chinas," fully exposing his intention to interfere in China's internal affairs.

Nisu Hao served as an "economic advisor" to the Wang Jingwei puppet regime during the Japanese militarist war of aggression against China, and he still cannot forget the puppet "Manchukuo" created single-handedly by Japanese militarism. In order to create a basis for his so-called "United States of China" conspiracy, he even fabricated rumors, saying that the race living in Northeast China is "different from mainland China."

This Japanese diplomat openly provoked the friendly relations between China and India, saying that India and China are "actually" in "competition." He even said that Japan believes it "must help India" "win this potentially important competition" and even dreams of using this influence to "correct" China's "political direction." This sixty-nine-year-old diplomat seems to have forgotten that it is no longer the era of Japanese militarism's aggression against Asia.

### 日本驻印大使公然挑拨中印友好关系  散布美制“两个中国”的谬论

    日本驻印大使公然挑拨中印友好关系
    散布美制“两个中国”的谬论
    新华社23日讯　日本新任驻印度大使那须皓曾经在12月12日在东京通过反动的泛亚社，公然发表言论，挑拨中国和印度的关系并支持美国侵占我国领土台湾、制造“两个中国”的阴谋。
    那须皓认为，所谓台湾问题可以在这种情况下解决，就是“成立包括台湾在内的‘中国合众国’或‘中国联邦’，台湾的地方政府可以保持它自己的政策。”那须皓的这种言论是改头换面地提出了美国制造的所谓“两个中国”的阴谋，完全暴露了干涉中国内政的居心。
    那须皓在日本军国主义进行侵略中国的战争的期间曾经担任过汪精卫伪政权的“经济顾问”，他到现在还念念不忘日本军国主义所一手制造的伪“满洲国”。为了替他的所谓“中国合众国”的阴谋制造根据，他竟然造谣说，住在中国东北的种族“同大陆中国的不一样”。
    这个日本外交官公开挑拨中国和印度的友好关系，说什么印度和中国“实际上”是在“竞争”，他甚至说日本认为它“必须帮助印度”“在这场具有潜在的重要性的竞争中得胜”，还梦想通过这种影响来“纠正”中国的“政治方针”。这个六十九岁的外交官似乎忘了现在已不是日本军国主义侵略亚洲的时代了。
