Put Down the Stinking Airs of the Colonialists
By a commentator of this newspaper

Following the "concern" expressed by the NATO Paris conference regarding Indonesia, the Dutch colonialists have evidently become even more arrogant. In recent days, the Dutch colonialists have been busily scheming to further collude with and rely on the imperialist bloc headed by the United States to threaten Indonesia. On December 23, the chief Dutch representative to the United Nations, Schurmann, sent a letter to the United Nations, expressing "protest" against Indonesia's actions to recover West Irian. Dutch Foreign Minister Luns even claimed that he would use the United Nations to interfere in Indonesia's patriotic movement. At the same time, Luns slandered Indonesia's takeover of Dutch enterprises as "violating international law," and threatened Indonesia, saying that the basis for negotiations between the Netherlands and Indonesia was already "very narrow" and the situation had "seriously deteriorated."

But, people must ask the Dutch colonialists: You occupy Indonesia's West Irian, you plunder the resources and sweat of the Indonesian people, you infringe upon the sovereignty of others. Isn't it you who are violating the most basic principles of international law? The ones who have the right to lodge the most furious protests should be the Indonesian people and government, and definitely not the Dutch colonialists.

The Indonesian government has repeatedly stated that it can recover West Irian through negotiations, but the Dutch colonialists have consistently refused to negotiate. It is clear that Luns's statement that the basis for negotiations between the two sides is now "very narrow" is entirely the responsibility of the Dutch colonialists. It seems that the Dutch colonialists have not seen, or are unwilling to see, that the current Indonesian people are no longer the slaves under the rule of the East India Company, they have already stood up. It is no longer the time for the Dutch colonialists to intimidate and threaten them. Whether or not the Dutch colonialists are willing to negotiate is entirely their freedom, but the Indonesian people also have their own complete freedom, which is to recover West Irian and eliminate the remnants of colonialism. Now is the time for the Dutch colonialists to put down their stinking airs.

    放下殖民者的臭架子
    本报评论员
    在北大西洋公约组织巴黎会议对印度尼西亚表示“关切”以后，荷兰殖民者显然更加嚣张了。这几天，荷兰殖民者正在到处张罗，企图进一步勾结和依靠以美国为首的帝国主义集团，来威胁印度尼西亚。12月23日，荷兰驻联合国首席代表舒尔曼致函联合国，表示“抗议”印度尼西亚为了收复西伊里安而采取的行动。荷兰外交大臣伦斯更声称要利用联合国来干预印度尼西亚的爱国运动。同时，伦斯把印度尼西亚接管荷兰企业的行动污蔑为“违反国际法”，并且恫吓印度尼西亚说，荷兰和印度尼西亚双方谈判的基础已经“非常狭小”，局势已经“严重地恶化”。
    可是，人们要问荷兰殖民者：你们霸占着印度尼西亚的西伊里安，你们掠夺着印度尼西亚人民的资源和血汗，侵犯了别人的主权，违反了国际法最基本原则的，难道不正是你们吗？有权提出最愤怒的抗议的，应该是印度尼西亚人民和政府，而绝不是荷兰殖民者。
    印度尼西亚政府曾经一再表示过可以通过谈判来收复西伊里安，但是荷兰殖民者却始终拒绝谈判。可见伦斯所说目前双方谈判基础已经“非常狭小”，这完全要由荷兰殖民者负责。看来，荷兰殖民者并没有看到，或者不愿意看到现在的印度尼西亚人民已经不是东印度公司主宰下的奴隶，他们已经站起来了。荷兰殖民者对他们进行恫吓、威胁已不是时候。愿不愿意谈判，荷兰殖民者完全有它的自由，但印度尼西亚人民也有自己的完全的自由，这就是收复西伊里安、扫除殖民主义的遗患。现在是荷兰殖民者必须放下臭架子的时候了。
