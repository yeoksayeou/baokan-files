    Welcome Art Troupes to Visit Industrial and Mining Areas!
    Recently, Shang Xiaoyun and his troupe went to Xuanhua Town, Hebei Province, for a tour performance, which was warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the working people.
    Xuanhua Town is an industrial and mining area in Hebei Province with a population of 100,000. Usually, only Hebei Bangzi Opera, Ping Opera and other opera genres are frequently performed, and cultural life is relatively poor. This time, although Shang Xiaoyun's troupe only performed for a few days, it left a deep impression on people. During their performances, the "full house" sign was hung high in front of the theater every day, and in front of the ticket window, there were still many workers, farmers, and soldiers requesting to buy a ticket. At the same time, under the loudspeakers installed in the streets and alleys by the town's broadcasting station, many people wearing thick cotton coats and felt shoes braved the severe cold of more than ten degrees below zero to listen quietly to the live broadcast of the theater. Every time the performance ended, everyone applauded enthusiastically to express their gratitude to Shang Xiaoyun and his troupe for their wonderful performances.
    Many old workers said after listening to the opera: "If it weren't for the new society led by the Communist Party, how could our place see 'famous actors' performing for us! In the old society, let alone we didn't have money, even if we did, you couldn't invite them!"
    We welcome more art troupes to visit industrial and mining areas!

    欢迎艺术团体到工矿区来！
    最近，尚小云和他的剧团到河北省宣化镇作巡回演出，受到广大劳动人民的热情欢迎。
    宣化镇是河北省一个拥有十万人口的工矿区，平时经常上演的只有山西梆子、评戏等剧种，文化生活比较贫乏。这次尚小云剧团虽然只是短短几天的演出，但给人们已留下了深刻的印象。在他们演出时，剧场门前每天都高挂着“客满”的牌子，而在售票的窗口前还有不少的工人、农民、军人在要求买一张戏票。同时镇上广播站装设在街头巷口的喇叭下，有很多人穿着大棉袄、毡鞋等冒着零下十多度的严寒，在围着静听剧场实况的转播。每当演出一结束，大家就热烈地鼓掌，来表示对尚小云和他的剧团所作精彩表演的感谢。
    很多老工人听了戏后说：“要不是共产党领导的新社会，咱们这地方哪能看到‘名角’给咱们演戏！在旧社会别说咱们没钱，就是有钱你也请不来呀！”
    我们欢迎更多的艺术团体到工矿区来！
