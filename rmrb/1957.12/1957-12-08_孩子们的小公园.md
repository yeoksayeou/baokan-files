Children's Little Park
Here is a simple and beautiful park. The park has pine trees, swings, rocking horses, chairs and white rabbits.
To build such a small park, you only need to prepare a little loofah, branches, sorghum stalks, mud and cardboard. The pine trees in the park have leaves made of loofah cut into the shape of trees and dyed green; the trunks are made of small branches; and the roots are made of mud. The ponies, puppies, chairs, and swings in the park are all made of sorghum stalks dyed in various colors. The rabbits are cut from cardboard. We are introducing the layout and method of making the park. If you are interested, you may wish to lead your children to build a small park too. (Song Lvyun, Yi Yonghua)

　　孩子们的小公园
    这里介绍一所简单而又美丽的公园。公园里有松树、秋千、木马、椅子和小白兔。
  要想建设这样一座小小的公园，只需要准备一点丝瓜瓤、树枝、高粱秆、泥土和硬纸块就行了。公园里的松树，树叶是用丝瓜瓤子剪成树的形状，染上绿色做成的；树干是用小树枝做成的；根部是用泥土做的。公园里的小马、小狗、椅子、秋千，都是用高粱秆染上各种不同的颜色做成的。小兔是用硬纸剪成的。我们把公园的布置和做法介绍出来，如果大家有兴趣，不妨领着自己的孩子也来建设一座小公园。　　　　（宋绿云、易永华）
