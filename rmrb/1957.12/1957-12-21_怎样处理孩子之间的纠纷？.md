How to Handle Disputes Between Children?
		Jing Sheng

    When children reach the age of two or three, they have a desire to play with other children. This is the beginning of a child's entry into a peer group.

    Children like to play together, but they also often have disputes. This is unavoidable and there is no need to be alarmed. However, some parents always favor their own children and cannot handle things fairly and reasonably. In this situation, disputes between children often lead to quarrels between adults. They even lock their children in the house, forbidding them from playing with other children, which has a very bad influence on the formation of the child's personality.

    How should we handle disputes between children?

    The most important thing is that adults should handle problems fairly and reasonably, and not only see the advantages of their own children and not see the advantages of other children. Parents all love their children, but the true love of children should be the correct recognition of the child's strengths and weaknesses, and educate the child to be good at getting along with others. We should also treat other people's children equally and care about them.

    When dealing with disputes between children, it is very important that adults maintain a calm attitude. For example, two children are fighting. One says, "He hit me first." The other says, "He hit me first." In fact, sometimes they don't remember who hit whom first; however, no one is willing to admit their mistake. Parents should take a calm attitude to find out the truth of the matter and must not be emotional and deal with it simply. Some parents think that their child hitting someone else is a disgrace to them, so they pull the child over and beat and scold them; some parents think that their child has been taken advantage of and cannot bear it, so they take their child to the neighbor's house to settle the score. All these practices are wrong.

    Children's disputes often arise from games, and the purpose of the quarrels is mostly to compete for toys. Therefore, adults should care about children's games and organize them to play well, which can prevent some quarrels and fights from happening because of playing. If you encounter such things, adults should also discuss with them how to play this game well; at the same time, educate them to have a spirit of humility and fraternity in the middle of playing. If you find two children fighting, parents should not only pull them apart and explain the truth to them, but also ask them to admit their mistakes to each other; afterwards, they should consciously invite the other party to come to their house to play and help them restore their feelings. That is to say, when dealing with children's disputes, we must be good at grasping the measure and treat them differently according to different situations.

    It is impossible to absolutely avoid any disputes between children. It is also absolutely wrong to take a laissez-faire attitude towards disputes between children. The important thing is that parents should pay attention to these problems and deal with them seriously, which plays an important role in developing the relationship between children.

    怎样处理孩子之间的纠纷？
    京生
    孩子长到两三岁的时候，就有和别的孩子在一起玩的要求。这是孩子走入同年儿童集体的开始。
    孩子们喜欢在一起玩，但是也常常容易发生一些纠纷。本来，这是免不了的事，不必大惊小怪。可是有些父母，总是偏袒自己的孩子，不能作出公平合理的处理。在这种情况下，常常由于孩子之间的纠纷引起大人的争吵。他们甚至把孩子关在屋子里，不许自己的孩子和别人的孩子一起玩，因而对孩子的个性形成起了很坏的影响。
    怎样处理孩子之间的纠纷呢？
    最重要的是成人要公平合理地处理问题，不能只看见自己孩子的优点，看不见别人孩子的优点。做父母的都是爱护自己的孩子的，但是真正的爱护孩子，应该正确地认识孩子的优点和缺点，教育孩子善于与人相处。对别人的孩子也要“一视同仁”，关心他们。
    在处理孩子之间的纠纷时，大人的态度要冷静，这是十分重要的。比方说，两个孩子打架了。这个说，“他先打我。”那个说，“他先打我。”其实，究竟谁先打谁，有时他们已经不记得了；但是，谁都不肯承认自己有错误。作父母的要以冷静的态度，弄清事实的真象，决不能心情激动，简单处理。有的父母认为自己的孩子打了人，觉得给自己丢了脸，拉过孩子，打骂一顿；有的父母认为自己的孩子吃了点亏，心里受不了，拉着自己的孩子找到邻居家里去算账。这种种做法都是错误的。
    孩子的纠纷往往是从游戏引起的，争吵的目的也多半是为了争玩具。因此，成人应当关心孩子们的游戏，并且组织他们很好地游戏，这就可以防止一些因为玩而发生吵嘴打架的事了。如果遇到这类事情，大人还应当和他们一起商量这个游戏怎样才能玩得好；同时教育他们在玩的中间，应有谦让和友爱精神。如果发现两个孩子在打架，作父母的不仅应该把他们拉开，向他们说清道理，并且要他们向对方承认错误；事后，还应该有意识地邀请对方到家里来玩，帮助他们恢复感情。这就是说，在处理孩子纠纷的时候，要善于掌握分寸，要根据不同情况分别对待。
    想使孩子之间绝对避免发生任何纠纷，是不可能的。对孩子间的纠纷抱不管不问的态度，也是绝对错误的。重要的是，父母要重视这些问题，并认真处理这些问题，这对发展孩子之间的相互关系有重要的作用。
