Waste Bottle Caps are Useful

Do you have soda or beer bottle caps at home? Do you throw them away as waste after opening the bottles? Please keep them from now on! We can use them to do many things. Here are a few ways to utilize bottle caps:

　　Scale Remover: Find a wooden strip that is five or six tenths of an inch thick, half an inch wide, and five or six inches long. Nail two bottle caps to one end of the wooden strip (as shown in the picture), and it becomes a great tool for scraping fish scales.

　　Soap Shaver: Take a bottle cap and nail it to one end of a short stick (as shown in the picture) to make a soap shaver. Using it to shave soap flakes is not only safer and faster than using a knife, but also produces uniformly thick soap flakes.

　　Pipe Cleaner: Nail bottle caps around a wooden stick (as shown in the picture) to create a pipe cleaner. By rotating and scraping it back and forth inside a dirty pipe, you can remove rust, soot, and other dirt from the pipe.

　　Bottle caps can also be used as shoe scrapers. Simply take a piece of wood of suitable size and nail bottle caps all over it to create a very useful shoe scraper. When nailing, the curved side of the bottle caps should face up so that they can scrape off the mud from the soles of shoes.

### 废瓶盖也有用

    废瓶盖也有用
    你家里有汽水瓶或啤酒瓶的瓶盖吗？你是不是开瓶后就把它们当作废物扔掉了？请你以后把它们留下吧！我们可以利用它来做许多事情。这里介绍几种瓶盖利用法：
    刮鳞器：找一根五、六分厚，半寸宽，五、六寸长的木条，在木条的一端钉上两个瓶盖（如图）就成为一种很好的刮鱼鳞的工具。
    刮皂片器：用一个瓶盖，钉在一根短棒的一端（如图），就成为刮皂片器。用它刮肥皂片，不但比用小刀安全而迅速，并且刮下来的肥皂片厚薄均匀。
    管内除污器：把瓶盖钉在一根木棒的周围（如图），就成为一个管内除污器。用它在脏管内来回转动刮刷，可以除去管内的铁锈、烟灰等脏东西。
    瓶盖还可以作刮鞋板。只要取一块大小适宜的木板，在上面钉满瓶盖，就成为一个很好用的刮鞋板了。钉的时候，瓶盖的曲边应朝上，这样，它就能刮去鞋底上的烂泥。
