    Facts Prove That the Wages of Strong Laborers and Odd-Job Workers Are Indeed Too High
    Li Wenjin and several other strong laborers published their opinions in the People's Daily on November 30th (page 3): They believed that "ordinary workers in the construction industry are different from other ordinary workers. They do heavy work, eat a lot, and wear out their clothes easily. Our current wages for strong laborers are not high." I think this is not in line with reality. We are now implementing a piece-rate wage system. If they can meet the quota, then each strong laborer (based on a Level 2 worker standard) can earn 1.82 yuan per day. According to our Civil Engineering Division's practice over the past year, all ordinary workers can meet the quota as long as they don't slack off. Taking our division's nearly one hundred ordinary worker groups in October as an example, they averaged 111.83% of the quota. This efficiency is also normal throughout the year. Among them, Wang Sanwei's group reached 179.91% of the quota, and Liu Xiuyun's group reached 169.53%. Individual groups even reached 200% of the quota in July and August. This means that an ordinary worker earns almost more than two yuan or even around three yuan per day. This is higher than the wage of a Level 3 carpenter, and of course, higher than a farmer's daily labor income.

    After I saw the draft of the interim regulations on the wage treatment of ordinary workers and odd-job workers promulgated by the State Council, I wholeheartedly supported it. The wage treatment of ordinary workers and odd-job workers in our factory is somewhat too high. Take the comrades in the Welfare Section as an example. They do work such as carrying water, sweeping the floor, guarding the bathhouse, selling water tickets, and watching the house. Their monthly salary is 52.87 yuan for the high end, and 40 yuan for the low end. There is also a "pleasure team" composed of more than twenty people, mainly responsible for clearing garbage. The amount of work they do in eight hours is not as much as what others do in two hours. However, most of their monthly salaries are 52.87 yuan. Our slag conveying team also does hourly work. In addition to inspecting the machines, lubricating them, and supplying more than 600 tons of slag every day, we also have to push iron powder, raw coal, and natural coke for four hours, and we also have to work the night shift. Our workload is much greater than that of the "pleasure team." But our slag team has a total of twelve people, and the highest monthly salary is also 52.87 yuan, and the lowest is 45.18 yuan. Comparing the two, the wages of the odd-job workers and the "pleasure team" are obviously too high. If this continues, not only will the farmers have opinions about them, but we will also have many opinions!

    事实证明
    壮工、勤杂工的工资的确太高
    人民日报11月30 日三版发表的李文金等几个壮工的意见：认为“建筑业的普通工和别的普通工不一样，干的活累，吃的多，穿的费，我们壮工目前的工资不算高”，我认为是不符实际的。我们现在实行的是计件工资制度，如果能达到定额，那末，每个壮工（以二级工为标准）每天就可以拿到一元八角贰分的工资。根据我们土建工程处一年来的实践证明，所有普通工只要工作不偷懒，都能达到定额。用我们处10月份近百个普通工小组为例，他们平均达到定额111.83％。这个效率在全年中也是正常的。其中如王三畏领导的小组达到定额的179.91％，刘秀云领导的小组达到169.53％，个别小组在7、8月份还达到定额的200％。这就是说，一个普通工每天差不多都拿到两元以上甚至三元左右的工资。这比一个三级木工拿的工资还高，比农民每天的劳动收入当然更高。

    我看到国务院公布的关于普通工和勤杂工的工资待遇的暂行规定草案后，从心眼里拥护。我们厂的普通工和勤杂工的工资待遇，就有些偏高。拿福利科的工友来说吧，他们每天做的是提水、扫地、看澡塘子、卖水票、看房子等工作，每月工资多的五十二元八角七分，少的四十元。还有二十多人组成的“享受队”，主要是清除垃圾，每人八小时干的活，赶不上别人两小时干的多。可是他们的月工资大多数是五十二元八角七分。我们矿渣输送组，也是干计时工作。我们每天除检查机器、润油和供应六百多吨矿渣外，还要推四小时铁粉、原煤和天然焦等工作，晚上还得上夜班，我们的劳动量比“享受队”不知多多少。但我们矿渣组共十二个人，月工资最高的也是五十二元八角七分，最低的是四十五元一角八分。对比一下，勤杂工和“享受队”的工资显然是太高了。如果这样继续下去，不但农民对他们有意见，我们的意见也很多啊！
