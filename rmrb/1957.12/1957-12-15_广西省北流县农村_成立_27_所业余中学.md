    Rural Beiliu County, Guangxi Province
    Establishes 27 Spare-Time Middle Schools

    (Our Newspaper News) Twenty-seven rural spare-time middle schools have been established in Beiliu County, Guangxi Province, with a total of forty-eight classes, enabling more than 2,300 higher primary school graduates in the county to study while working in production.

    These spare-time middle schools are managed by a board of directors composed of local Party, government, Youth League, and relevant departments, which are specifically responsible for school equipment, enrollment, and financial income and expenditure. High school graduates in the villages are hired as teachers. To facilitate students' attendance and teachers' teaching, each spare-time middle school borrows classrooms from central primary schools for classes. School funding is borne by the students themselves.

    These spare-time middle schools stipulate that all junior high school courses will be completed in four years, with eight lessons per week, so that both teachers and students can participate in agricultural production and study. At present, these spare-time middle schools only offer Chinese and arithmetic courses. In the future, they plan to gradually add algebra, chemistry, biology, agricultural knowledge, and political classes. In order to strengthen the school's political and ideological education and teaching work, the county's education administrative department is preparing to convene a meeting of spare-time middle school teachers to study how to improve the quality of teaching.

    广西省北流县农村
    成立27所业余中学
    本报讯　广西省北流县成立了二十七所农村业余中学，共有四十八个班，使全县两千三百多个高小毕业生能够边生产边学习。
    这些业余中学由当地的党、政、团和有关部门组成校董会，具体负责学校设备、招生和经费收支等工作。学校聘请在乡的高中毕业生担任教师。为使学生上学和教师上课方便，各业余中学都借中心小学的教室上课，学校经费由学生自己负担。
    这些业余中学规定，四年学完初中全部课程，每星期上课八节，使教师和学生都能参加农业生产，又能学习。现在，这些业余中学只开设语文、算术两科，今后准备逐渐增设代数、化学、生物、农业常识和政治课等。为了加强学校政治思想教育和教学业务，该县教育行政部门，准备召开业余中学教师会议，研究提高教学质量。　（卢加兴）
