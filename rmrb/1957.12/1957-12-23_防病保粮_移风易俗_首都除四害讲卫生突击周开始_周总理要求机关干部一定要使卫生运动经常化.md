Preventing Disease and Protecting Grain, Changing Customs and Habits
The Capital's "Eliminate the Four Pests and Emphasize Hygiene" Campaign Begins
Premier Zhou Enlai Requires Cadres to Ensure Regular Hygiene Movement

Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd: The capital today launched an unprecedented "Eliminate the Four Pests and Emphasize Hygiene" campaign突击 with large-scale publicity activities.

The purpose of the campaign is to prevent disease, protect grain, change customs and habits, and further improve the sanitary conditions of the capital. During the突击, the focus will be on eliminating overwintering mosquitoes and flies. According to scientists' statistics, a pair of flies can breed five million flies in one summer; eliminating one mosquito or fly now is equivalent to eliminating millions of mosquitoes and flies in the summer.

Today, a propaganda team of more than 50,000 people, composed of Party and government leaders, Red Cross members, Red Cross youths, cadres, and street activists, all took to the streets, beating gongs and drums, holding models of mosquitoes, flies, rats, sparrows, and propaganda posters, to publicize the "Eliminate the Four Pests and Emphasize Hygiene" campaign to the masses. Wang Kunlun, Deputy Mayor of Beijing, gave a street speech to citizens in the Qianmen Railway Station Square, calling on the people of the city to take action and first thoroughly eliminate overwintering mosquitoes and flies. Yan Jingqing, a famous public health expert and Director of the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau, explained how to prevent and control winter infectious diseases. The secretaries of the district Party committees, district heads, secretaries of the district committees of the Communist Youth League, and chairwomen of the district women's federations also gave speeches on the streets. More than 290 broadcasting stations throughout the city broadcast their programs. The Cultural Troupe of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the China Acrobatic Troupe, and other art groups participated in today's publicity activities with artistic performances. Seven broadcasting propaganda vehicles, decorated with various propaganda materials and "four pests" models, conducted a roving propaganda campaign throughout the city. Many cinemas and theaters in the city broadcast three to five-minute speeches before each show, reminding the audience of the harm of the "four pests" to people and urging everyone to take action to eliminate the four pests and emphasize hygiene.

Today, the enthusiasm of many workers, staff members, students, and citizens in the capital for "Eliminating the Four Pests and Emphasizing Hygiene" was very high. They used their Sunday holiday to clean offices, courtyards, and residences. More than 1,000 residents in the Xisi District carried out clean-up campaigns in their respective streets. Bai Baiheng, a representative of street residents in this district, challenged the residents of the city on Beijing People's Broadcasting Station with the competition conditions of completely eliminating mosquitoes and flies and basically eliminating rats. The Qianmen District Grain Supply Station organized a congratulatory team to congratulate its 14 grain distribution branches on their achievements in "Eliminating the Four Pests and Emphasizing Hygiene." Many experts in "Eliminating the Four Pests" also "shared their experiences" by introducing their experiences to residents with their typical examples.

The capital's "Eliminate the Four Pests and Emphasize Hygiene" campaign began on the 5th of this month. Many leading cadres of central and local organs personally arranged and participated in this campaign. The State Council organs have taken action in accordance with the unified arrangements of the Beijing Patriotic Health Campaign Committee. Premier Zhou Enlai personally urged and put forward the request to the organs that "we must make the movement regular." The enthusiasm of the masses in eliminating the "four pests" is very high. More than 90,000 rats have been caught in the city, and more than 110,000 sparrows have been caught in the suburbs. After inspection, nearly 10,000 households in the Dongsi District have reached 97% and 99% or more of households without mosquitoes and flies, respectively. However, the development of the movement is not very balanced. Some areas and units are not very enthusiastic about eliminating overwintering mosquitoes and flies, and some organs, enterprises, and schools have not taken serious action. To this end, the Beijing Patriotic Health Campaign Committee decided to突击 for a week throughout the city, from the 22nd to the 29th in the urban area, and from the 24th to the 31st in the suburbs. Regardless of urban or rural areas, men or women, young or old, every household should mobilize, everyone should take action, and the "Eliminate the Four Pests and Emphasize Hygiene" campaign should be pushed to a climax in a vigorous and resolute manner. During the突击, in addition to vigorous publicity and vigorous突击, supervision and inspection will also be strengthened. Many units have now designated persons in charge of health work to be responsible for promoting the "Eliminate the Four Pests and Emphasize Hygiene" campaign in their units, and at the same time, they will ensure that the campaign is regular after the突击.

    防病保粮  移风易俗
    首都除四害讲卫生突击周开始
    周总理要求机关干部一定要使卫生运动经常化
    新华社22日讯  首都今天以空前规模的宣传活动，展开了“除四害、讲卫生”运动突击周的序幕。
    运动的目的是防病保粮、移风易俗、进一步改变首都的卫生面貌。在突击周内，将以消灭过冬的残存蚊蝇为中心。根据科学家的统计，一对苍蝇在一个夏季能繁殖五百万只苍蝇，现在消灭一个蚊蝇，就等于夏天消灭千百万个蚊蝇。
    由党、政负责人、红十字会会员、红十字少年、干部和街道积极分子五万多人组成的宣传队伍今天全部出动，敲锣打鼓，举着蚊、蝇、老鼠、麻雀的模型和宣传画，在大街小巷向群众宣传“除四害、讲卫生”。北京市副市长王昆仑在前门车站广场向市民们作了街头演说，号召全市人民行动起来，首先彻底消灭过冬蚊蝇。著名的公共卫生学专家、北京市卫生局局长严镜清在这里讲解了如何防治冬季传染病等方面的问题。各区的中共区委书记、区长、共青团区委书记、区妇联主席等也分别上街讲演。遍设在全市各主要街道的二百九十多个广播站都分别作了广播。中国人民解放军总政治部文工团、中国杂技团等文艺团体，都用文艺节目参加了今天的宣传活动。用各种宣传品和“四害”模型装饰起来的七辆广播宣传车在全市进行巡回宣传。全市许多电影院、剧场在每场开演前，都进行三、五分钟的广播讲话，提醒观众们“四害”对于人们的危害性，要求人人动手，除四害、讲卫生。
    今天，全城许多工人、职员、学生和市民“除四害、讲卫生”的热情十分高涨。他们利用星期天休假打扫了办公室、院落和住宅。西四区有一千多个居民在所在地的各个街道进行了清洁大扫除。这个区的街道居民代表白柏恒在北京人民广播电台以彻底消灭蚊蝇和基本上灭鼠的竞赛条件，向全市居民提出挑战。前门区粮食供应站组织了贺喜队，到所属的十四个粮食分店去祝贺他们在“除四害、讲卫生”方面取得了好成绩。许多“除四害”的能手，也都“现身说法”，用自己的典型事例向居民介绍了自己的经验。
    首都的“除四害、讲卫生”运动是从本月5日开始的。中央各级机关的许多领导干部亲自布置并参加了这一运动。国务院机关按照北京市爱国卫生运动委员会的统一布置已经行动起来。周恩来总理曾亲自进行督促，并且向机关干部提出“一定要使运动经常化”的要求。广大群众除“四害”的热情很高，全市已经捕鼠九万多只，郊区已经捕捉了十一万多只麻雀。东四区近万户居民经过检查，无蚊蝇的住户已分别达到97％和99％以上。但运动的发展还不很平衡，有些地区和单位对于消灭过冬的残存蚊蝇劲头不大，部分机关、企业、学校还没有认真行动起来。为此，北京市爱国卫生运动委员会决定在全市范围内突击一周，城区从22日到29日，郊区从24日到31日，地无分城市乡村，人无分男女老少，家家动员，人人动手，大张旗鼓、雷厉风行，把“除四害、讲卫生”运动推向高潮。在突击周内，除大力宣传，大力突击外，并将大力督促检查。现在许多单位已指定管理卫生工作的负责人，负责推动本单位“除四害、讲卫生”运动，同时在突击周后保证运动经常化。（附图片）
