　  High-Altitude Mountainous Area Weining Autonomous County
　  Large-scale Soil Improvement
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Weining Yi, Hui, and Miao Autonomous County, located in a high-altitude mountainous area of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, has decided to continue improving 80,000 mu of soil this winter and next spring. Collective farmers of all ethnic groups in the county are investing in this large-scale soil improvement campaign.
    Of the 1,040,000 mu of cultivated land in Weining Yi, Hui, and Miao Autonomous County, 95% is distributed on the tops of high mountains and hillsides at an altitude of about 2,000 meters, of which 350,000 mu are barren yellow mud and gray bubble soil, resulting in extremely low grain yields. Since 1953, the county has widely adopted the method of applying nitrate mud, lime, rock ash, and fertile mud to barren land to improve nearly 110,000 mu of soil, increasing grain production by 7,630,000 jin.

　  高寒山区威宁自治县
　  大规模改良土壤
    据新华社讯　位于云贵高原高寒山区的威宁彝族回族苗族自治县，决定今冬明春继续改良土壤八万亩。全县各族集体农民正投入这个大规模的改良土壤运动。
    威宁彝族回族苗族自治县的一百零四万亩耕地中，有95％分布在海拔二千公尺左右的高山顶和半山坡，其中有三十五万亩是土质瘠瘦的黄泥地和灰泡地，粮食产量极低。从1953年以来，这个县就普遍采用在瘦地施放硝泥、石灰、岩灰和肥泥的办法，改良土壤近十一万亩，增产粮食七百六十三万斤。
