Xinhua News Agency, December 21st: In response to the United States' practice of promoting atomic war preparations through the Paris Conference, Western countries' politicians and the public continue to demand negotiations with the Soviet Union.

London News: Former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Mr. George Kennan, said in a BBC television program on the 20th that the results of the Paris NATO meeting have made negotiations between the West and the Soviet Union more difficult. The meeting's agreement in principle to set up missile bases in Europe has made it difficult for the US and Britain to negotiate peace issues with the Soviet Union.

Kennan admitted that there is no so-called "communist military threat" at all, because "there is nothing in Marxism to support the expansion of world socialism by force." He said: "The Soviet Union has never invaded another country by force."

Kennan advocated that the West should further negotiate with the East, should not set up nuclear weapons in European countries, and should establish a region in central Europe without the armed forces of major powers. Germany should become a unified, neutral country that does not participate in Eastern and Western blocs.

However, Kennan still demanded that the United States maintain an "atomic deterrent force" to deal with the Soviet Union.

Fifty members of the Labour Party organization in the Hampstead district of London have asked the British government to begin negotiations with Soviet leaders on the proposals made by Bulganin in his letter to Macmillan.

Even within the ruling Conservative Party, some are dissatisfied with the government's policies. "The Daily Telegraph and Morning Post" published a letter from Conservative MP Osborne, asking the government to begin negotiations with the Soviet Union. The letter emphasized that "because of Britain's position, it will suffer greater losses in an atomic war than any other country in the world."

Rome News: The leadership of the Italian Socialist Party issued a statement expressing concern about the Italian government's foreign policy, which "damages national interests and violates the wishes of the people."

The leadership of the Socialist Party believes that "it is possible to resume direct negotiations between the West and the Soviet Union, and a high-level international conference must be held to reach an agreement on disarmament and the establishment of a neutral zone without nuclear weapons in Europe."

The statement said that the Italian Socialist Party believes that recent international events have proved the correctness of the following proposal: "namely, the proposal to establish a neutral zone in Europe as the basis for ensuring European security; the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Western and Eastern European countries, and the resumption of negotiations between major powers, especially between the United States and the Soviet Union."

Paris News: Representatives of peace activists from West Germany and the Saar have come to Paris to submit petitions to the delegations of various countries participating in the NATO summit, protesting against arming West Germany with atomic weapons and demanding that NATO member states hold negotiations with the Soviet Union to discuss a plan to establish a region in Europe where no nuclear weapons are placed.

Toronto News: Former Canadian Foreign Minister Lester Pearson, speaking at a banquet on the 19th, called on the United States to "hold serious negotiations with the Soviet Union on some outstanding issues." Pearson echoed the call for "both strength and negotiation," saying that NATO should maintain its military nature while also serving as "an instrument for negotiating peace."

    西方政界反对原子备战政策
    要求同苏联谈判并建立欧洲中立区
    本报综合报道  据新华社21日讯：针对美国通过巴黎会议推行原子战争准备政策的做法，西方国家政界和公众，继续要求同苏联举行谈判。
    伦敦消息：前美国驻苏联大使凯南20日在英国广播公司电视节目谈话中说，巴黎北大西洋公约组织会议的结果已经使西方同苏联的谈判更加困难了，会议在原则上同意在欧洲设置导弹基地已经使美英难以同苏联谈判和平问题。
    凯南承认，根本不存在所谓“共产主义的军事威胁”，因为“在马克思主义里没有任何东西支持以武力来扩张世界社会主义”。他说：“苏联从未以武力侵犯过别国。”
    凯南主张：西方应当进一步同东方进行谈判，不应当在欧洲国家设置核武器，应当在欧洲中部成立一个没有大国武装部队的地区。德国应当成为一个不参加东西方集团的统一的中立的国家。
    但是凯南仍然要求美国保持“原子威慑力量”来对付苏联。
    伦敦汉普斯特德区的工党组织的五十名党员已经要求英国政府同苏联领导人就布尔加宁写给麦克米伦的信中提出的建议开始进行谈判。
    在执政的保守党当中也有人对政府的政策感到不满。“每日电讯与晨邮报”刊载了保守党议员奥斯本的一封信，要求政府同苏联开始进行谈判。这封信着重指出，“由于英国所处的地位，它在原子战争中会遭受到比世界上任何一个国家都要大的损失”。
    罗马消息：意大利社会党领导机构发表声明，对“损害国家利益、违背人民愿望”的意大利政府的外交政策表示不安。
    社会党的领导机构表示相信：“西方同苏联之间恢复直接谈判是可能的，而且必须举行高级国际会议，以便就裁军和在欧洲建立一个没有原子武器的中立地区问题达成协议。”
    声明说，意大利社会党认为，近来的国际事件证明了以下建议的正确性：“即建议在欧洲建立中立地区，作为保证欧洲安全的基础；从西欧和东欧国家撤出一切外国军队以及在各大国之间，特别是在美国和苏联之间恢复谈判”。
    巴黎消息：西德和萨尔的和平人士代表纷纷来到巴黎，向参加北大西洋集团最高级会议的各国政府代表团递交请愿书，抗议用原子武器武装西德和要求北大西洋公约组织成员国同苏联举行谈判，讨论在欧洲建立一个不放置核武器地区的计划。
    多伦多消息：加拿大前外交部长莱斯特·皮尔逊19日在一个宴会上讲话的时候要求美国“就一些悬而未决的问题同苏联举行认真的谈判”。皮尔逊附和“要实力也要谈判”的主张，表示北大西洋公约组织在保持它的军事性质的同时也应当作为“一个谈判和平的工具”。
