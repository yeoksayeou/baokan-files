　　The Kunming Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau, in improving its work, not only adopted several steps for addressing public opinions, such as registering them, analyzing and studying materials, classifying problems, involving the public in handling them, and reporting the results of the handling to the public, but also paid attention to the following issues:

　　First, considering that the public has certain limitations in observing problems, and also cannot fully express their opinions in big-character posters, they did not completely stay within the scope of the original opinions raised by the public when improving their work. Instead, they analyzed and studied the opinions, found the essence of the problems, and fundamentally improved them. For example, cadres of the bureau's children's education and care center raised opinions that children were difficult to manage and the chaos was serious. After research, the leadership found that the reason was that in the past, ordinary orphans and child thieves were mixed together and treated the same. Therefore, it was decided to separate the two types of children for management and education, and a set of corresponding management and education methods was formulated, which completely solved the problem.

　　Second, in improving work, in addition to checking and improving the problems raised by the public, they also actively checked whether there were similar problems. If there were similar problems, they would be solved. In this way, some problems not raised by the public were also solved.

　　Third, when solving more significant problems, relevant policies and information were collected in advance as research reference materials.

　　Because the Kunming Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau paid attention to these issues, the rectification progress was faster and more practical, and the public was more satisfied. As of November 22, they had resolved 92.2% of the problems raised by the public during the rectification phase.

　　Obviously, these practices of the Kunming Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau in rectification reflect their positive attitude towards rectification and their determination to truly improve their work. Units that adopt a piecemeal approach to rectification, dealing with problems as they arise, modifying only what the public raises, should learn from them.

### 整改要有主动性积极性

　　整改要有主动性积极性
    昆明市民政局在改进工作中，不但对群众的意见采取了登记、分析研究材料、问题分类排队、吸收群众参加处理、向群众交代处理结果等几个步骤，而且注意了以下几个问题：
    第一、由于考虑到群众观察问题有一定的局限性；同时，也不可能把自己的意见在大字报上完全表达出来。因此，在改进工作的时候，他们没有完全停留在群众原提意见的范围里，而是经过分析研究，找出问题的实质，从根本上加以改进。如该局儿童教养院干部提出对儿童难以管教、混乱现象严重等意见，领导上经过研究，找出原因，是在于过去把一般孤儿和童窃混在一起，一律对待所致。于是决定对两类儿童分开管教，并订出了一套相适应的管教办法，彻底解决了这个问题。
    第二、在改进工作中，除了就群众已提出的问题进行检查、改进外，还主动检查有无类似的问题。如有类似的问题，即加以解决。这样，有些群众没有提出的问题也得到解决。
    第三、在解决比较重大的问题时，事先搜集有关的政策和情况，作为研究参考资料。
    昆明市民政局由于注意了这些问题，整改进度较快，也比较实际，群众也比较满意。到11月22日为止，他们已解决了群众在整改阶段中提出问题的92.2％。
    显然，昆明市民政局在整改中的这些做法，反映了他们对整改的积极态度和真正想改进工作的决心。那些对待整改采取就事论事、零敲碎打、群众提一点改一点，提什么改什么的做法的单位，应该向他们学习。
