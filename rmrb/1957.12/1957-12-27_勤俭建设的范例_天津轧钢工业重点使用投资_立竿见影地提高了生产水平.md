Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, December 26th, (Xinhua News Agency reporter Meng Fan reports:) The development of Tianjin's local steel rolling industry during the First Five-Year Plan provides a model for diligence, economy, and the rational use of state funds. Within five years, the steel rolling industry used over 2,127,000 yuan of state funds to transform backward technology and equipment, increasing the annual steel output from over 23,000 tons in 1952 to over 190,000 tons in 1957. If the expansion project currently under construction is included, the annual production capacity can reach 250,000 tons.

The most significant characteristic of the steel rolling industry's use of state funds is that every yuan of investment plays a role in ensuring the completion of the state plan, as required by the state plan. Therefore, the vast majority of state investment during the five-year period was used to solve key production problems. In terms of the allocation of the total investment, 66% was used to increase new equipment, transform existing equipment and factory buildings; 12% was used to adopt new technologies to reduce workers' physical labor and improve production efficiency; and only 2% was used to build non-productive buildings such as offices and canteens.

In the early stages of the First Five-Year Plan, the equipment of all eleven steel rolling plants was very rudimentary, capable of only rolling Class B steel, which did not meet national requirements in terms of tensile and torsional strength. At the same time, the varieties were also limited to nine-millimeter round steel and small flat steel, and they could not produce six-and-a-half-millimeter wire rod suitable for the wire drawing and nail making industries, which once caused production and sales difficulties. In order to meet the state's requirements for increasing the production of wire rod, in 1955, more than 500,000 yuan of funds were used to renovate two steel rolling workshops, increasing the output of steel by more than two times. In terms of quality, after adding physical performance testing instruments and improving the shortcomings in equipment and operation, the rolled steel gradually reached the Class A standard. The renovation project made full use of existing factory buildings and equipment, only increasing the number of steel rolling units and power equipment. The Tianjin Municipal Heavy Industry Bureau, which led this renovation, promptly summarized the experience of rationally using state investment. In 1956 and 1957, it focused on renovating five more workshops, further improving production efficiency. The rotation speed of the rolling mills has increased from more than 100 revolutions per minute in 1952 to more than 500 revolutions per minute.

The rapid growth of production efficiency in various steel rolling plants has caused an imbalance in billet and steel production. Especially since 1956, when the state abolished four-inch square small steel ingots and switched to six-inch to eight-inch square crude steel ingots, various steel rolling plants were unable to directly roll steel from large steel ingots due to equipment limitations, making it even more urgent to increase billet production capacity. Therefore, in 1956, more than 600,000 yuan of funds were used to add a billet mill, so that the billet and steel rolling capacity was initially balanced. This machine was installed in the old factory building of the Steel Rolling Plant No. 1. When the old factory building was not large enough, it was extended with iron frames, the roof was covered with asbestos boards, and thin brick walls were built around it, with a layer of mud plastered on the bricks, which cost very little.

Tianjin's steel rolling industry's method of focusing on using investment to solve key production problems according to the requirements of the state plan has not only improved the production level "immediately," but also enabled the state to recover more funds. According to statistics for the whole year of 1956 and from January to November 1957 alone, the profits obtained are equivalent to ten times the total state investment in five years.

    勤俭建设的范例
    天津轧钢工业重点使用投资  立竿见影地提高了生产水平
    新华社天津26日电　新华社记者孟帆报道：天津市地方轧钢工业在第一个五年计划期间的发展，为勤俭节约、合理运用国家资金提供了一个范例。五年内，轧钢工业使用国家资金二百十二万七千多元，改造了落后的技术设备，使钢材的年产量由1952年的二万三千多吨提高到1957年的十九万多吨。如果把正在施工的扩建工程计算在内，年生产能力可以达到二十五万吨。
    轧钢工业使用国家资金的最大特点是：根据国家计划的要求，使每一元投资都能对保证完成国家计划发挥作用。因此，五年期间国家投资的绝大部分，都是用于解决生产关键问题。在投资总额的分配方面，用于增加新设备、改造旧有设备和厂房的，占66％；用于采用新技术，减轻工人体力劳动，以提高生产效率的，占12％；用于兴建办公室、食堂等非生产性建筑的，只占2％。
    在第一个五年计划的初期，所有的十一个轧钢厂的设备都十分简陋，只能轧制乙类钢材，在拉力和扭力方面都达不到国家要求。同时，品种也只有九公厘的元钢和小型扁钢，不能生产适合拔丝、制钉行业需要的六点五公厘的盘条，因而曾经造成生产和销售的困难。为了适应国家增产盘条的要求，在1955年利用五十多万元资金改建了两个轧钢车间，钢材的产量提高了两倍以上；质量方面，在增添了物理性能试验仪器、改进了设备和操作中的缺点以后，轧出的钢材逐步达到了甲类标准。改建工程尽量利用了旧有的厂房和设备，只是增加了轧钢的机联数和动力设备。领导这次改建的天津市重工业局及时地总结了合理运用国家投资的经验，在1956年和1957年的两年中，又重点地改建了五个车间，进一步提高了生产效率，轧钢机的转数已由1952年每分钟一百多转提高到五百多转。
    各轧钢厂生产效率的急速增长，又引起了开坯和钢材生产的不平衡。特别是从1956年起，国家取消了四寸见方的小钢锭，改为六寸到八寸见方的粗钢锭以后，各轧钢厂由于设备限制，不能直接用大钢锭轧制钢材，增加开坯能力就更加迫切。因此，1956年又利用六十多万元资金增添了一部开坯机，使开坯和轧钢的能力得到了初步平衡。这部机器安装在轧钢一厂旧有的厂房内，旧厂房不够大，就用铁架接长，顶棚铺石棉板，四周砌了薄薄的砖墙，砖上抹着一层草泥，花钱很少。
    天津轧钢工业根据国家计划要求，有重点地使用投资解决生产关键问题的方法，不仅“立竿见影”地提高了生产水平，也使国家收回了更多的资金。仅据1956年全年和1957年1月到11月的统计，获得的利润就相当于五年内国家投资总额的十倍。
