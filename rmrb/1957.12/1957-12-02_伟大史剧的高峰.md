People have become accustomed to calling the two man-made satellites new moons. Compared to this, I think the two declarations published in Moscow can be called two new suns.

The new moon only displays the achievements of socialist countries in science and technology, leaving the United States, which prides itself on being the head of capitalism, far behind. This achievement is great and of historical significance; the new sun is the achievement of the world's progressive humanity itself, and it shows that the whole world is about to become paradise. This achievement is especially great and especially historically significant.

The new moon carries "Laika," precision instruments, and perfect communication equipment; the new sun carries more than 2 billion hearts, the joy and voices of more than 2 billion people in the world. More than 2 billion hearts radiate huge light, operating with the force of thunder. Whether it is night or day, anyone can see this light and hear this sound. Even those monsters and demons who are so scared that they shrink into a ball, close their eyes, and cover their ears cannot escape it.

People often like to compare the world to a wonderful stage. So, on this stage, great historical dramas are being performed one after another. The one currently being performed is an even greater historical drama than any previously performed. The people have named this historical drama "Socialism Triumphs over Capitalism." More than 2 billion people are playing great roles in this drama, fighting against those who play the role of capitalist clowns. There have been hardships and difficulties, twists and turns, failures, and risks, but people have always moved forward with perseverance and infinite optimism. Thus, victory arrives.

The "Communist Manifesto," published more than a hundred years ago, and the two current declarations are both great chapters of this great historical drama.

The "Communist Manifesto," as the prelude to this historical drama, has its never-fading glory. It illuminates the entire path of socialism's victory over capitalism with the light of truth; however, this road is, after all, one that mankind has never traveled before. The great pioneers, with their great spirit of sacrifice, led mankind onto this road. This achievement will last forever. Now, under the illumination of this brilliant light, mankind has taken great strides on this road. The declarations issued by the people on the march are no longer just predictions and road signs, but rather true reports of the experiences of the people on the march, the sights and sounds of the journey, and the conditions of life. They also report to those who are following along: Communism is no longer a "strange shadow" "wandering in Europe," but a magnificent and splendid manor that is clearly visible. The feet of the Soviet people at the forefront of this team are about to step inside.

The new declarations are the climax of the historical drama of socialism's victory over capitalism. Look! Humanity is cheering, the paean of communism rises into the clouds; on the entire world stage, peace, unity, progress, victory... countless rays of light, the ranks of socialism, the ranks of peace, the ranks of national liberation, the ranks of democracy... advancing rapidly like an overwhelming avalanche. This climax also foreshadows the impending end of this historical drama. An even greater historical drama, the prelude to the historical drama of the construction of human communist society, is about to begin. Those who are walking in front are already preparing to play new roles with great enthusiasm.

The new declarations—the new sun shines brightly, the east wind prevails, overwhelming the west wind, showing that the harsh winter of mankind is about to be shed completely, and spring will forever remain in the world. Great sun! Great east wind! Will forever be with the great spring!

    伟大史剧的高峰
    葛德
    人们已习惯于把两颗人造卫星称作新月亮，与此相比，我以为可以把在莫斯科发表的两个宣言，称作两个新的太阳。
    新的月亮显示的还只是社会主义国家在科学技术上的成就，它把自诩资本主义之首的美国远远抛在后面。这成就是伟大的，有历史意义的；新的太阳是世界进步人类本身的成就，它显示整个人间就要变为天堂，这成就尤其伟大，尤其有历史意义。
    新的月亮携带的是“莱伊卡”，是精密的仪器，是完善的通讯设备；新的太阳携带的却是世界上二十多亿颗心、二十多亿人民的欢乐和声音。二十多亿颗心放射着巨大的光芒，以雷霆万钧之势运行着。无论黑夜或白天，任何人都能看得见这光芒，听得见这声音。即使那些牛鬼蛇神们害怕得缩成一团，闭起眼睛，掩起耳朵，也不行。
    人们常爱把世界比作一个奇妙的舞台。那么，在这个舞台上，伟大的史剧一幕连一幕地演出着。目前，正在演出着的，是比以往演出过的更为伟大的史剧。人民把这个史剧命名为“社会主义战胜资本主义”。二十多亿人民，都在这剧中饰演着伟大的角色，同那些饰演资本主义小丑的角色们斗争着。这里面，有过艰辛困苦，有过曲折迂回，有过失败，有过风险，然而，人们总是以坚毅不拔的精神，无限乐观地前进着。于是，胜利到来。
    发表在一百多年前的“共产党宣言”，和现在的两个宣言，同是这个伟大史剧的两个伟大的篇章。
    “共产党宣言”，作为这个史剧的序幕，有着它永不磨灭的光辉。它以真理之光，照明了社会主义战胜资本主义的整个途径；然而，这道路毕竟还是人类未曾走过的。伟大的先驱者以伟大的牺牲精神，率领人类跨上这条道路。这功绩将永垂人间。现在，在这灿烂的光芒的照耀下，人类已是大踏步在这条道路上跨进。行进的人们发出的宣言，已不再只是预示和路标了，而是行进着的人们的经历、路途的见闻、生活的状况的真实报道。他们也向随着前进的人们报道：共产主义，已不再是在“欧洲游荡”的“怪影”，而是历历在目的堂皇瑰丽的大庄园。在这支队伍前列的苏联人民的脚，已是要跨进去的了。
    新的宣言是社会主义战胜资本主义史剧的高潮。看吧！人类在欢呼，共产主义的凯歌高入云霄；整个世界舞台上，和平、团结、进步、胜利……毫光万道，社会主义的行列，和平的行列，民族解放的行列，民主的行列……浩浩荡荡排山倒海般地迅速前进。这高潮也预示这史剧的行将结束。更伟大的史剧，人类共产主义社会建设的史剧的序幕，即将拉开。走在前边的人，已满怀热情地准备扮演新的角色了。
    新的宣言——新的太阳高照，东风大作，压倒了西风，展示出人类的严冬将要脱尽，春天将永远停留人间。伟大的太阳啊！伟大的东风啊！将同伟大的春天一起永在！
