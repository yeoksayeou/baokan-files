    Donghu Agricultural Cooperative Does a Good Job in Year-End Distribution
　　Increased Public Accumulation, Overdue Loans Repaid
    (Our dispatch) The Donghu Agricultural Cooperative in Donggou Township, Urumqi County, Xinjiang, paid attention to expanding public accumulation and repaying overdue loans during the year-end distribution this year, accumulating reserve funds, and the income of its members still increased compared to last year.
    This year, due to increased production, the actual income of the members of the Donghu Agricultural Cooperative has greatly increased. According to statistics, the income of 93% of the members of the cooperative has increased, with a net income of 210 yuan per person per year, which greatly exceeds the living and production level of local well-to-do middle peasants before joining the cooperative.
    However, since last year, after Donghu Agricultural Cooperative increased production and income, it one-sidedly emphasized more distribution and less deduction, thus neglecting public accumulation, which affected expanded reproduction. Not only was it impossible to repay the 15,000 yuan of national loans that were due, but even the 5,000 jin of highland barley seeds for this spring's sowing could not be raised, and as a result, it had to borrow another 500 yuan from the state. At the same time, among some members, due to increased production without thrift and increased income without reserves, the trend of waste prevailed. After last year's distribution, members went to Urumqi City in groups for leisure, wasting about 10,000 yuan.
    The Donghu Agricultural Cooperative accepted the lessons of the past. This year, on the basis of increasing the income of its members, it appropriately expanded public accumulation. The agricultural cooperative deducted 9.2% of the total income for the public accumulation fund, 2% for the public welfare fund, plus agricultural taxes and other expenses, a total of 36.7%, an increase of 5.7% over last year. Even so, the actual income of each member increased by 35 yuan compared to last year. Under the call for diligence and thrift in managing the household and saving reserves, all members invested and saved more than 20,000 yuan in agricultural cooperatives and credit cooperatives, accounting for more than 50% of the actual cash distribution. Now the Donghu Agricultural Cooperative has decided to take out 22,000 yuan from the public accumulation to repay all the national loans due in the past three years, and then take out more than 2,000 yuan to build a five-li-long canal, which can expand the irrigation area by more than 1,000 mu.

### 东湖农业社年终分配作得好　公共积累增多　到期贷款还清

    东湖农业社年终分配作得好
　　公共积累增多　到期贷款还清
    本报讯　新疆乌鲁木齐县东沟乡东湖农业社今年在年终分配时，注意扩大公共积累，归还到期贷款，积存了储备金，社员收入仍比去年增多。
    东湖农业社今年由于生产增长，社员的实际收入大有增加，据统计，全社有93％的社员增加了收入，每人每年净收入二百一十元，大大超过了当地富裕中农入社前的生活和生产水平。
    但是，从去年以来，东湖农业社在增产增收后，片面强调多分少扣，因而忽视了公共积累，影响了扩大再生产，不但一万五千元到期的国家贷款没法归还，而且连今春播种的五千斤青稞籽种也无从筹措，结果不得不向国家再贷款五百元。同时，在一些社员中，由于增产不节约，增收不储备，浪费之风大兴。去年分配后，社员们成群结队进乌鲁木齐市闲逛，浪费约一万多元。
    东湖农业社接受了过去的经验教训，今年在社员增加收入的基础上，适当地扩大了公共积累，农业社从今年总收入中扣留公积金9.2％，公益金2％，再加上农业税等各项费用，共扣留36.7％，比去年增加了5.7％。就是这样，每个社员的实际收入也比去年增加了三十五元。全体社员在勤俭持家、节约储备的号召下，向农业社、信用社投资和储蓄共二万多元，占实分现金的50％以上。现在东湖农业社决定从公共积累中拿出二万二千元，归还三年来各项到期的国家贷款，再拿出二千多元修建一条五里长的水渠，可扩大灌溉面积千余亩。（郝健）
