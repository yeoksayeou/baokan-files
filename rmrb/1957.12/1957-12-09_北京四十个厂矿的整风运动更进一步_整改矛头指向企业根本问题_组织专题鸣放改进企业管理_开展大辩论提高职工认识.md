Xinhua News Agency, December 8th—The rectification movement in forty major state-owned factories and mining enterprises in the capital, after more than two months of all-out rectification and handling of 765,000 opinions raised by employees (accounting for 90% of all opinions), has now begun to point the spearhead of advancement at the remaining 10%, namely 85,000 opinions.

These 10% of opinions are all related to fundamental issues of running socialist enterprises well. The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to continue to fully utilize the current mass rectification upsurge to further resolve these problems. Furthermore, based on this, in accordance with the principle of running enterprises diligently and thriftily, the masses will be mobilized to further air their views on several key issues in production management, organizing the widespread enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of employees, and launching a massive new upsurge in production to welcome the beginning of the Second Five-Year Plan. To this end, in addition to instructing each factory and mining enterprise to separately propose solutions and corresponding rules and regulations, and to report to their respective higher authorities for study and approval at each level, the Municipal Committee has also begun preparations to organize thematic airing of views and socialist debates on some of the issues that should be discussed and resolved by the employees, so as to solve these fundamental problems from both the organizational system and the ideological understanding of the masses.

Since the rectification movement in forty state-owned factories and mining enterprises in the capital officially began in late August, it entered a high tide of airing views in early September and a high tide of improving work in late September. Significant achievements have already been made in improving enterprise management and strengthening the relationship between leaders and the masses. First, on a comparable basis, non-production personnel have been reduced from an average of 26.6% of the total number of employees to 17.4%, a reduction of 42%. The streamlined management structure has shed its bloated and ineffective appearance, management personnel are closer to production and the workers, and work efficiency has greatly improved.

Second, many wasteful phenomena have been exposed, stopped, and eliminated. According to statistics from five units, simply reducing the backlog of tools, waste of raw materials, and utilization of scrap materials based on mass opinions has saved the country more than 5 million yuan. The practice of running enterprises diligently and thriftily is gradually taking shape. At the same time, under the principle of spending less money and accomplishing more, the working conditions of workers have been further improved.

Third, cadres who made mistakes have generally made self-criticisms to the masses. Many cadres have also formulated plans and systems for maintaining close ties with the masses, and the relationship between leaders and the masses has been further strengthened.

Fourth, some issues related to the daily life and welfare of employees that could be resolved within the authority of the factory or mine, such as adjusting housing and rationally allocating houses, and facilitating timely medical treatment for sick employees, have generally been resolved.

The leadership's action of mobilizing the masses to resolutely rectify their work style and improve their work has, in turn, most effectively enhanced the class consciousness of the broad masses of workers. The workers' general reaction to the leadership's willingness to correct mistakes and their reliance on them to improve their work is: "We have helped the leadership and educated ourselves." They said: "If the leadership's problems are resolutely corrected, we must also resolutely correct our own problems." Through specific ideological work, on issues related to the lives and welfare of employees, they compared their living standards with those of veteran workers before liberation, with the current level of peasant brothers, and with the current level of national construction. After making these three comparisons and recognizing the great significance of building the country diligently and thriftily for the rapid completion of socialism, many workers consciously realized their leading position and the responsibilities they bear. The employees of the Shijingshan Power Plant reduced some welfare standards in accordance with national regulations; 132 employees' family members at the State-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Mill have returned to their hometowns; and many young apprentices at the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, who used to complain about low wages, now feel that their wages are not low but high.

In the process of improving their work, these forty factories and mining enterprises have constantly encountered various obstacles. Some people who do not know how to follow the mass line, do not believe in the majority of the masses, or have shortcomings themselves, are not very determined to rectify and do not have enough enthusiasm. They always try to use various trends to divert the movement to other directions, attempting to evade, skip over, or even deviate from the goal of improving their work. According to the main fact that more than 99% of the opinions raised by the broad masses of workers are well-intentioned and more than 90% are correct or basically correct, and in accordance with the instructions of the higher-level Party committee, the Party organizations of each factory and mining enterprise, after the airing of views entered a high tide, generally did not refute or launch debates on some erroneous opinions, except for some debates conducted within a limited scope later, based on the consciousness and demands of the masses and in conjunction with resolving individual specific issues. Instead, they fully mobilized the masses and launched a vigorous upsurge of improving work with one heart and one mind. Therefore, in a very short period of time, hundreds of thousands of opinions were handled, and those relatively simple and easy-to-handle problems were basically solved. At the same time, many long-standing or relatively major problems that were usually difficult to handle were also solved.

In order to improve the quality of problem-solving and achieve the goal of thoroughly improving work, these forty factories and mining enterprises repeatedly reviewed the rectification work. Generally, they reviewed twice, and some reviewed three times, until the masses no longer had any opinions. The method of review was mainly for the leadership to publicize the rectification situation to the employees, or to make a summary report on the rectification, and then mobilize the masses to discuss and let the masses re-air any problems that had not been corrected or had not been corrected well, and then rectify according to the opinions of the masses.

In the process of repeated review, each factory and mining enterprise found many problems. Among the improperly rectified problems, the main problem was the failure to consult with the masses and the use of subjectivism and bureaucratic attitudes to handle the opinions of the masses, so the proposed solutions were often not in line with the actual situation. For example, workers in the casting department of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant suggested adding a turntable to the railway to facilitate transportation. The workshop leaders believed that the plant did not have a turntable, so they wrote on the opinion record sheet to the foreman for explanation. When the foreman explained to the workers, the workers laughed as soon as they heard it and said, "We have already found an old turntable and installed it, why are you still explaining it?" Some problems were handled simply and perfunctorily, and the answers were irrelevant. Some problems were simply answered as "pay attention in the future," "correct in the future," and "hand over to relevant personnel for handling," and the masses were very dissatisfied with this kind of vague answer. Some factories and mining enterprises, when solving the daily life and welfare problems of employees, because they were in the high tide of rectification and were afraid that employees would raise opinions, had the phenomenon of not considering carefully and making promises casually without principle. These unreasonable phenomena were promptly corrected during the review with the employees.

After the mass review, the problems that could be solved by these forty factories and mining enterprises themselves have generally been solved. According to this situation, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to turn the spearhead of improving work to the remaining 10% of opinions. Now, in addition to combining thematic airing of views to organize the widespread enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of employees to meet the production tasks of the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan, the leaders of each factory and mining enterprise are analyzing the unhandled opinions, distinguishing which can still be solved by the unit itself, which need to be solved with the assistance of higher-level organs, and which need to be solved through debate. Many factories and mining enterprises have arranged their schedules and are preparing to solve them in batches.

    北京四十个厂矿的整风运动更进一步
　　整改矛头指向企业根本问题
　　组织专题鸣放改进企业管理　开展大辩论提高职工认识
    新华社8日讯　首都四十个较大的国营厂矿企业的整风运动，在全力进行了两个多月的整改，处理了职工所提出的七十六万五千条意见（占全部意见的90％）以后，现在前进的矛头已开始指向所剩下的10％即八万五千条意见。
    这10％的意见，都是有关办好社会主义企业的根本性的问题，中共北京市委决定继续充分运用现在已经掀起的群众性的整风高潮来进一步解决这些问题。并且在此基础上，按照勤俭办企业的方针，就生产管理上的若干关键问题发动群众进一步鸣放，把广大职工群众普遍存在的生产积极性和创造性组织起来，掀起一个声势浩大的生产新高潮，迎接第二个五年计划的开始。为此，市委除了已责成各厂矿企业分别提出处理办法和相应的规章制度，报告所属上级逐层研究批准以外，同时已着手准备就其中若干应由职工群众讨论解决的问题，组织专题鸣放和社会主义大辩论，以便分别从组织制度上和群众的思想认识上双管齐下地来解决这些根本性的问题。
    首都四十个国营厂矿企业的整风运动在8月下旬正式开始以后，9月上旬即进入鸣放高潮，9月下旬进入改进工作的高潮。在改进企业管理和密切领导同群众的关系等方面，已经获得了重大成就。一、按可比部分，非生产人员由平均占职工总数的26.6％紧缩到17.4％，非生产人员较前减少42％。紧缩以后的管理机构已摆脱了臃肿失灵的现象，管理人员更加接近生产和工人群众，工作效率较前大大提高了。
    二、揭发、制止和消除了很多浪费现象。据五个单位统计，只是根据群众意见减少工具积压、原料浪费和利用废旧料一项，就为国家节约了五百多万元。勤俭办企业的风气正在逐渐形成。同时，在少花钱多办事的原则下，还进一步改善了工人的劳动条件。
    三、有错误的干部普遍向群众作了检讨。许多干部还制定了密切联系群众的计划和制度，领导跟群众之间的关系进一步密切了。
    四、在本厂矿企业权限范围内能解决的一些有关职工日常生活福利方面的问题，例如调整住房及合理分配房屋，便利患病职工及时就诊等问题，一般都解决了。
    领导上发动群众狠狠地整顿作风和改进工作的行动，反过来又最有成效地提高了广大工人群众的阶级觉悟。工人们对于领导上知过必改和依靠他们全力改进工作的普遍反映是：“帮助了领导，也教育了自己。”他们说：“领导上的毛病坚决地改了，我们身上的毛病也得坚决改。“通过具体的思想工作，在有关职工生活福利的问题上，他们同解放前老工人的生活水平比，同农民兄弟当前的水平比，又同整个国家当前的建设水平比，在进行了这三种比较并且认清了勤俭建国对于尽速建成社会主义的重大意义以后，许多工人就自觉地意识到自己所处的领导地位和所担负的责任。石景山发电厂的职工按照国家规定降低了若干福利标准；国营北京第一棉纺织厂已经有一百三十二名职工家属还乡；以前喊叫工资低的北京第一机床厂的很多青年徒工，现在也觉得工资不是低而是高了。
    这四十个厂矿企业在改进工作的过程中，曾经不断地遇到各种各样的阻碍。有些不会走群众路线、不相信群众多数或者本身有缺点的人，对整改的决心不大，劲头不足，总想利用各种风势把运动撁到别的方向去，企图捎过、越过以至离开改进工作这个目标。各厂矿企业的党组织，根据广大工人群众所提出的意见99％以上都是善意的、90％以上又都是正确或基本正确这一主要事实，按照上级党委指示，在大鸣大放进入高潮以后，对一些错误的意见除在以后根据群众的觉悟和要求，结合解决个别具体问题，在有限范围内进行了一些辩论外，一般暂不批驳，也不展开辩论，而是全力发动群众，掀起了一个万众一心的轰轰烈烈的改进工作的高潮。因此，在很短的时间内就处理了几十万条意见，把那些比较简单又较易处理的问题基本上都处理了，同时还处理了许多长期没有处理或者一些平时不易处理的比较重大的问题。
    为了提高处理问题的质量，达到彻底改进工作的目的，这四十个厂矿企业曾经反复地对整改工作进行了复查，一般都复查两次，有的复查三次，直到群众再没有意见为止。复查的方法，主要是领导上把整改的情况向职工群众公布，或者作整改的总结报告，然后发动群众进行讨论，让群众对没有改或改得不好的问题重新鸣放出来，再根据群众的意见进行整改。
    在反复进行复查的过程中，各厂矿企业都发现了不少问题。在整改不当的问题中，主要是不找群众商量，以主观主义、官僚主义的态度处理群众意见，因此提出的解决办法往往不符合实际情况。如石景山钢铁厂铸造部工人建议在铁道上加一个转盘，便于运输。车间领导干部认为本厂没有转盘，便在意见记录表上批交工长解释。当工长向工人解释时，工人一听就笑起来了，说：“我们已经找了一个旧转盘安上了，还解释干吗？”有的问题处理得简单草率，答复得文不对题。有些问题则简单地答复为“今后注意”、“今后改正”、“交有关人员处理”等，群众对这种不痛不痒的答复很不满意。有些厂矿企业在解决职工生活福利问题时，因为处在整改的高潮中，怕职工提意见，曾发生考虑不周和无原则地随便许愿的现象。在会同职工进行复查时，就把这些不合理的现象及时纠正过来了。
    经过群众性的复查，现在这四十个厂矿企业凡能由本单位自行处理的问题，一般已处理完毕。中共北京市委根据这种情况，决定把改进工作的矛头转向剩下的10％的意见。现在各厂矿企业的领导上除结合专题鸣放，把广大职工群众普遍存在的积极性和创造性加以组织，以迎接第二个五年计划第一年的生产任务以外，正在对那些没有处理的意见进行分析，分清哪些还是可以由本单位解决的，哪些是要由上级机关协助解决的，哪些是要通过辩论来解决的。不少厂矿企业已排列好日程，准备分批解决。
