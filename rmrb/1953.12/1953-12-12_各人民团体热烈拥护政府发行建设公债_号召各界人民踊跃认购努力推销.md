Xinhua News Agency, December 11th: Various people's organizations in our country warmly endorse the Central People's Government's issuance of the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds and call on members of their organizations to actively, enthusiastically, and take the lead in subscribing to ensure the successful completion of the bond sales work.

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued a call to the broad masses of workers and staff nationwide regarding supporting the issuance of national economic construction bonds. The call stated: Union members and fellow workers and staff! Actively subscribing to bonds is supporting national economic construction, and it is a practical act of patriotism. Only by realizing socialist industrialization in our country can our country become prosperous and strong, our national defense be consolidated, and the lives of workers, peasants, and the people of the whole country be fundamentally improved, so that we can live a happy and joyful life forever. In recent years, the wages of our workers and staff have been increased to some extent, and our lives are gradually improving. It is entirely possible to take out a portion of our income and savings to purchase bonds. Therefore, our working class should resolutely support the government's measure of issuing construction bonds and enthusiastically subscribe to them. At the same time, we should actively publicize to the people of the whole country and use our own exemplary actions to promote people from all walks of life to do their best to purchase bonds, ensuring the successful completion of the bond sales and subscription work. The call also stated: The state issues bonds to concentrate funds for construction. Our working class is the main force in industrial production and capital construction. We must launch labor emulation drives, push the labor emulation drive further forward, so that every bit of the country's funds can be fully utilized, creating more wealth for the country, accumulating more construction funds for the country, and striving to realize national industrialization and gradually transition to a socialist society.

The All-China Democratic Women's Federation said in written comments: The Central People's Government's issuance of economic construction bonds is an important measure. The issuance of construction bonds will inevitably accelerate the process of socialist industrialization in our country. Therefore, it is in line with the long-term interests of the people of the whole country, and it is also in line with the long-term interests of women. The All-China Democratic Women's Federation expresses its warm support for this important measure. In the past, during the Central People's Government's issuance of Victory Real Value Bonds, urban women群众 across the country played a significant role in actively subscribing to and promoting mass subscriptions. This time, we believe that the broad masses of women across the country will continue to carry forward the spirit of patriotism, enthusiastically subscribe, and strive to complete or overfulfill the subscription plan.

The All-China Federation of Democratic Youth said in written comments: The Central People's Government's issuance of economic construction bonds is of great significance for raising funds for socialist industrialization, promoting national industrialization, and developing the national economy, and it is also in line with the greatest interests of the people of the whole country and our youth. The youth of the whole country warmly support this decision. Chinese youth have a glorious patriotic tradition and have played an active role in past movements. Especially recently, under the education and inspiration of the general line and general task of the country's transition period, they have further raised their awareness and recognized the bright future of socialism and the responsibility of youth in building a socialist motherland. Therefore, the youth of the whole country will certainly be able to actively play a role in this bond promotion work, enthusiastically subscribe, and actively publicize to the people the great significance of the state's issuance of bonds, and strive for the successful completion and overfulfillment of the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds.

Tian Demin, Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation, said: Just as our students across the country are enthusiastically studying the country's general line and rejoicing for our country's bright socialist future, the Central People's Government has decided to issue national economic construction bonds next year, which is of great significance for our country to accumulate construction funds and accelerate the country's socialist industrialization. We believe that the students across the country will warmly support this measure. We call on the students across the country to work hard to assist the government in doing a good job in publicity work and strive for the rapid completion of the promotion of national construction bonds.

Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: Our people are currently working hard to realize the general line and general task of the country's transition period, and the issuance of construction bonds is of great significance. The complete fulfillment of this bond subscription will greatly help the smooth progress of the country's economic construction, and lay a solid foundation for the country's industrialization and the modernization of national defense. Therefore, this is fully in line with the common and highest interests of the people of the whole country. On behalf of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, I express my warm support for the government's issuance of bonds this time. In recent years, under the correct leadership and education of the government, the production and operation of industrialists and businessmen across the country have been continuously expanded and developed. Especially through the publicity and study of the national general line and general task, their political consciousness has been further improved. Therefore, it is entirely possible to successfully complete the amount of bonds allocated to the industrial and commercial circles by the state. Subscribing to bonds is a concrete manifestation of our industrial and commercial circles supporting national economic construction and patriotism. We must widely publicize the significance of issuing construction bonds among the broad masses of industrialists and businessmen across the country, and call on them to enthusiastically subscribe, and take the action of completing and overfulfilling construction bonds as a new contribution to national economic construction.

The person in charge of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles said in a written conversation: We clearly know that this bond is issued on the basis of the rising national economy and the generally improved political awareness of the people in our country, for the purpose of accelerating the country's economic construction. Therefore, there is no doubt that the broad masses of people across the country will warmly respond to the government's call and set off a wave of enthusiastic subscriptions. Our literary and art circles across the country must enthusiastically subscribe to bonds; actively carry out promotion work, and make full use of the effective tool of literature and art to vigorously carry out publicity.

    各人民团体热烈拥护政府发行建设公债
    号召各界人民踊跃认购努力推销
    【新华社十一日讯】我国各人民团体热烈拥护中央人民政府发行一九五四年国家经济建设公债，并号召自己组织中的成员积极地踊跃地带头认购，保证公债的推销工作胜利完成。
    中华全国总工会向全国广大职工发出关于拥护发行国家经济建设公债的号召。号召中说：工会会员和全体职工同志们！积极认购公债，就是支援国家经济建设，就是一种爱国主义的实际行动。只有在我国实现社会主义工业化，我们的国家才能富强，我们的国防才能巩固，工人、农民和全国人民的生活才能从根本上得到改善，我们才能永远过着幸福快乐的日子。几年来我们职工的工资已有所提高，生活在逐步地改善着，拿出一部分收入和积蓄来购买公债是完全可能的。因此我们工人阶级应当坚决拥护政府发行建设公债的措施，踊跃地认购公债。同时，应向全国人民积极地宣传，并以我们自己的模范行动来推动各阶层人民尽力购买公债，保证公债的推销和认购工作的胜利完成。号召中又说：国家发行公债，是为了集中资金，进行建设，我们工人阶级是工业生产和基本建设方面的主力军，我们必须展开劳动竞赛，把劳动竞赛向前推进一步，使国家的每一点资金都充分地发挥作用，为国家创造更多的财富，为国家积累更多的建设资金，为实现国家工业化和逐步过渡到社会主义社会而奋斗。
    中华全国民主妇女联合会在书面意见中说：中央人民政府发行经济建设公债，是一项重要的措施。发行建设公债必然会加速我国社会主义工业化的进程，因此，它是符合全国人民的长远利益，同时也是符合妇女的长远利益的。中华全国民主妇女联合会对这一重要措施，表示热烈拥护。过去，在中央人民政府发行胜利折实公债中，全国各地城市妇女群众曾在积极认购和推动群众认购中起了很大作用，这次，我们相信全国广大妇女必将继续发扬爱国主义精神，踊跃认购，为完成或超额完成认购计划而努力。
    中华全国民主青年联合会的书面意见中说：中央人民政府发行经济建设公债，对于筹集社会主义工业化资金，促进国家工业化和国民经济的发展，是有重要意义的，也是符合全国人民和我们青年的最大利益的。全国青年热烈拥护这一决定。中国青年有着光荣的爱国主义传统，在过去历次运动中都起了积极作用，特别最近在国家过渡时期总路线、总任务的教育和鼓舞下，更加提高了觉悟，认清了社会主义的美好前途和青年在建设社会主义祖国中的责任。因此，全国青年一定能够在这次推销公债工作中积极发挥作用，踊跃认购，并积极向人民群众宣传国家发行公债的重大意义，为一九五四年国家经济建设公债的胜利完成和超额完成而努力。
    中华全国学生联合会主席田德民说：正当我们全国学生热烈学习国家总路线，为我国美好的社会主义前途而欢欣鼓舞的时候，中央人民政府决定明年发行国家经济建设公债，这对我国积累建设资金，加速国家的社会主义工业化有着重大意义。我们相信全国学生定会热烈拥护这一措施。我们号召全国学生要努力协助政府作好宣传工作，争取国家建设公债推销工作的迅速完成。
    中华全国工商业联合会主任委员陈叔通说：我国人民目前正在为实现国家过渡时期总路线、总任务而努力，建设公债的发行是有重大意义的。全部完成这一次公债的认购，将大大有助于国家经济建设事业的顺利进行，奠定国家工业化、国防现代化的巩固基础。因此，这是完全符合全国人民共同的最高利益的。我代表全国工商业联合会对政府这次发行公债表示热烈拥护。几年来，全国工商业者在政府正确的领导和教育下，生产经营不断扩大和发展，特别通过国家总路线和总任务的宣传和学习，政治觉悟更有所提高，因而胜利地完成认购国家所分配给予工商界的公债数额，是完全可能的。认购公债正是我们工商界支援国家经济建设和爱国主义的具体表现。我们要在全国广大工商业者中，广泛地宣传发行建设公债的意义，并号召踊跃认购，以完成并超额完成建设公债的行动，作为对国家经济建设的新贡献。
    中国文学艺术界联合会负责人在书面谈话中说：我们清楚地知道：这次公债是在我国国民经济日益上升、人民政治觉悟普遍提高的基础之上，为了加速国家经济建设的目的而发行的。因此，毫无疑问，全国广大人民一定会热烈响应政府号召，掀起踊跃认购的热潮。我们全国文学艺术界一定要踊跃认购公债；积极展开推销工作，并要充分利用文学艺术这一有效的工具，大力进行宣传。
