Xinhua News Agency, December 11th: Soong Ching Ling sent a telegram to the Sino-Indian Friendship Association, congratulating the association on the opening of its first national conference. The telegram reads as follows:

Dear friends of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association:

In the nearly three years since the establishment of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association, your organization has grown and developed into a nationwide movement. As you convene your first national conference, it gathers new momentum to spread the awareness that this work is of utmost importance. Today, I feel that this work is of even greater significance.

World peace is a pressing issue in everyone's mind. People know that the increased possibility of peace that we are currently able to obtain is, to no small extent, due to the increasing friendly relations between the people of India and China. This therefore increases our responsibility to further strengthen these friendly ties and work together to take further steps to achieve world peace.

I heartily congratulate you on the achievements you have made so far. I also wish to express my firm belief that your organization will achieve even greater progress.

Long live the friendship between the people of India and China!

Soong Ching Ling

    宋庆龄电贺印中友协第一次全国会议
    【新华社十一日讯】宋庆龄致电印中友好协会，祝贺该会第一次全国会议的召开，电文如下：印中友好协会亲爱的朋友们：
    印中友好协会成立将近三年以来，你们的组织已经壮大发展成为一个全国性的运动了。在你们第一次全国会议召开的时候，它汇集起新的推动力量来传播这种认识，就是这一工作是具有极大的重要性的。今天我感到这一工作有着更为重大的意义。
    世界上的和平是每个人心目中的迫切问题。人们都知道：我们当前已能得到的业已增长的和平的可能性，在不小的程度上应归功于印度和中国人民间日益增加的友好联系。因此这就加重了我们的责任来进一步加强这些友好的联系并协力采取进一步的步骤以取得世界的安宁。
    我衷心地祝贺你们迄今已获得的成就。我并愿表示我坚信你们的组织将获得更多的进展。
    印度和中国人民间的友谊万岁！                                     
                                   宋庆龄
