Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 22nd. The Korean-Chinese delegation to the Military Armistice Commission issued the following communiqué on December 21st:

    The Military Armistice Commission held a meeting on December 21st.

    Major General Li Sang-jo, Chief Commissioner of the Korean-Chinese side, lodged the strongest protest with the US side against the crimes of directly instructing special agents to continuously murder Korean-Chinese prisoners of war demanding repatriation and sabotaging explanation work within the Tongjang-ri POW camp. Major General Li Sang-jo presented undeniable specific materials, accusing the US side of deploying a large number of Rhee and Chiang agents in the POW camp for a long time, including a large number of agents who had received specialized US training in violently controlling prisoners of war, and of seriously violating the armistice agreement by mixing this group of agents into the Tongjang-ri POW camp.

    Major General Li Sang-jo also listed specific facts of the US side's sabotage of the Korean-Chinese side's explanation work, sternly denouncing the US side's conspiracy to distort the "Terms of Reference," terminate the explanation work, and detain our captured personnel. Major General Li Sang-jo sternly pointed out that the US side must immediately cease its special agents' illegal activities and must not continue to threaten and obstruct the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Force from taking effective measures to thoroughly eliminate the US-deployed special agents and their organizations in Tongjang-ri, in order to ensure that the Korean-Chinese side's explanation work can be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the "Terms of Reference" and "Working Procedures." Major General Li Sang-jo also emphasized that the ninety days of explanation work for the Korean-Chinese side must be compensated. The handling of prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to repatriation after the ninety days of explanation work must be submitted to the political conference for discussion and resolution.

    Attachment 1: Statement by Major General Li Sang-jo Protesting the US Side's Instruction of Special Agents to Murder Our Captured Personnel:

    The instructions from Syngman Rhee and Wang Dongyuan conveyed by your special agent Park Dong-hyuk, intercepted by the Indian Custodial Force, have already revealed to the world the serious crimes of your direct instruction of special agents deployed by you in the Tongjang-ri POW camp to sabotage the explanation work and murder our captured personnel who insist on repatriation. At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on December 1st, you had to admit the facts revealed in this letter, but you did not terminate your illegal activities as a result. On the contrary, you instructed your special agents to intensify their inhuman atrocities to obstruct the repatriation of our captured personnel. On December 12th, Choi Jong-jun, Park Seok-sang, Choi Tae-yul, Kim Hak-soon, and other four captured personnel on our side who demanded repatriation in camp No. 38 of the Tongjang-ri POW camp were murdered by your special agents. Your special agents openly placed their corpses near the barbed wire of the camp to show the public, threatening other prisoners of war and preventing them from applying for repatriation. This shocking and brutal murder case once again revealed that the POW camp under your special agents' control is worse than a Nazi concentration camp.

    Speaking only of the murder incidents that have been exposed in the Tongjang-ri POW camp, since the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission took over the prisoners of war, your special agents, under your direct instructions, have murdered fourteen of our captured personnel. This is the direct result of the order from your Seoul Special Agent Headquarters to "clean up internally those who disobey orders" and "kill those who want to return to the North." You bear full responsibility for this series of inhumane and heinous crimes.

    For a long time, you have dispatched a large number of Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek's special agents, pretending to be prisoners of war in your POW camp to oppress and persecute our captured personnel, and engage in illegal activities such as forced tattooing, writing blood letters, and making fingerprints. Our captured personnel who insisted on repatriation with the slightest resistance were beaten and murdered. Before the signing of the armistice agreement, we warned you that among the prisoners of war who were not directly repatriated, all special agents sent by Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek must not continue to masquerade as prisoners of war and follow the prisoners of war to the demilitarized zone. However, you not only failed to remove the special agents mixed in with the prisoners of war, but also sent a large number of special agents to mix into the Tongjang-ri POW camp. When we handed over the non-directly repatriated prisoners of war on your side under our custody to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, we submitted their entire list to you. You have so far refused to submit to us the list of personnel who you claim are our captured personnel and handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for custody. The real reason is that you are afraid that your special agents will be identified by us, otherwise, what reason do you have not to hand over the list of those claimed to be our captured personnel to us?

    But your cowardly tricks cannot conceal your crime of thoroughly violating the armistice agreement. On the contrary, it can only further expose that you have planned to send a large number of special agents to mix into the Tongjang-ri POW camp to continue to maintain your reign of terror. When we handed over the prisoners of war to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission from you, we submitted to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission a list of more than 400 of the Rhee and Chiang agents you deployed in the POW camp, a large part of whom had received your special agent training on violently ruling prisoners of war. Now, the facts have proved that these special agents are the principal culprits in persecuting and murdering our captured personnel. For example, Wang Futian, the mastermind of the Zhang Zilong murder case and your special agent, was sent to your Jeju Island POW camp as the "Deputy Captain of the Third Regiment" after receiving special training at the US military special agent training class in Tokyo from April to July 1951, and is now mixed into camp No. 24 of the Tongjang-ri POW camp. Zhang Zunxian, another mastermind of the same case, was the principal of the so-called CIE school, a special agent organization established by you in the Jeju Island POW camp, and has now mixed into camp No. 25 of the Tongjang-ri POW camp. Your special agent Wang Shunqing was sent to the Jeju Island POW camp as the "First Regiment Commander" after graduating from a special training program at the US military special agent training class in Tokyo in May 1951, and has now also mixed into camp No. 17 of the Tongjang-ri POW camp under the pseudonym Zhang Yuqing, responsible for directing the criminal activities of murdering prisoners of war and sabotaging explanations. Your special agents Zhao Kaiwen, Zhong Zhiwei, and Zhao Jinzhong all received special training at the US military special agent training class in Tokyo in April 1952 and have now mixed into camps No. 12, No. 25, and No. 45 of the Tongjang-ri POW camp, respectively. Furthermore, Chi Gicheol and Han Eun-song, who are now mixed in camp No. 40 of the Tongjang-ri POW camp; Kim Seong-rok in the enclosure of the US 64th Field Hospital; Wen Zhonghao in camp No. 49; Yu Yonghwan and Li Jiseon in camp No. 52; and Kim Jeongho, one of the murderers in the camp No. 38 murder case, are all Syngman Rhee special agents sent by you to the POW camp. You insisted at this meeting and at the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference that you had no special agents in the Tongjang-ri POW camp. I now want to ask you, can you deny that these Chiang and Rhee special agents we have presented are veteran special agents who have been trained at your Tokyo special agent school? Can you deny that they are directly directed by your Syngman Rhee, Won Yong-deok, and Wang Dongyuan of the Chiang bandit's so-called embassy in South Korea? Can you deny that the receiver they use for illegal contact is provided by your "Army 8239 Unit First Broadcasting and Publishing Team"? Can you deny that the military mail number 500 used by these special agents to contact you is the same number as the military mail of Generals Clark and Hull's headquarters? The facts I have cited here are only individual examples. We have a large amount of concrete materials that cannot be denied by you regarding the fact that you sent special agents to mix into the POW camp to maintain your reign of terror.

    I now formally accuse you of being the murderers who murdered our captured personnel. I lodge the strongest protest with you. I demand that you immediately cease the illegal activities of your special agents, and at the same time, stop using the so-called prohibition of the use of force as an excuse to obstruct the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Force from taking effective measures to thoroughly eliminate the special agents and their organizations that you have deployed in Tongjang-ri, so as to ensure that we can carry out the ninety-day explanation work.

    Attachment 2: Statement by Major General Li Sang-jo Rebuking the US Side for Sabotaging the Explanation Work and Conspiring to Unilaterally Handle Prisoners of War:

    You are not allowed to evade responsibility for the repeated interruptions and suspensions of our explanation work in the Tongjang-ri POW camp. As early as before the transfer of prisoners of war to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, you actively deployed various steps to sabotage the explanation work. After the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission took over the prisoners of war, you delayed the construction of the explanation camp, proposed absurd construction time requirements, and deliberately delayed the start of the explanation work. Only after our thorough exposure and the firm opposition of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission did you have to finally withdraw the absurd construction time you proposed and construct the explanation camp according to the requirements of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, but this had already delayed the explanation work by nineteen days, and it could not begin until October 15th. Since the beginning of our explanation work, you have directly instructed your special agents to do everything possible to sabotage the explanation work. Your special agents did not allow the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army to listen to the explanation, so that our explanation work could not be carried out at all on the morning of October 16th and October 17th, and from October 18th to October 30th. The letters of your special agents intercepted by the Indian Custodial Force fully proved that Syngman Rhee himself and Won Yong-deok, the so-called commander-in-chief of the South Korean Gendarmerie, directly commanded the special agents mixed into the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army not to attend the explanation until all arrangements were in place. Your special agents sabotaged the broadcast for collective explanations, causing our explanation work to be unable to proceed again on November 2nd. Your special agents resisted the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's regulations on isolating the explained and unexplained prisoners of war, causing our explanation work to fall into a long-term suspension from November 6th. We have made various efforts with great patience, and tried to carry out the explanation work again on November 16th, but in the face of the unbridled resistance to isolation by your special agents, our explanation work could not be carried out from November 17th to December 20th. During this period, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission also independently arranged an isolation camp on December 10th, but under the sabotage of your special agents, the isolation regulations were still not immediately implemented to quickly restore our explanation work. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has clearly pointed out that the reason why the special agents under your direct instruction resist isolation is because they are afraid that this isolation arrangement will disrupt their special agent organization and damage their special agent rule. It must be pointed out here that long before you handed over the prisoners of war to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Force, you not only deployed a large number of Chiang and Rhee special agents to mix into the Tongjang-ri POW camp to sabotage the explanation work, but your commander also publicly agreed that the Chiang and Rhee special agents would not disrupt their organization so that they could continue to control the prisoners of war with violence. Only after our repeated efforts was our explanation work resumed today. Due to your various sabotage activities, our explanation work could only be carried out seven times until December 20th, and the total actual explanation time was less than forty-three hours. Within these forty-three hours, you also instructed your special agents to kidnap prisoners of war to make a lot of noise in the explanation tents and recite spells. You openly sent the Rhee and Chiang special agents who had been entrenched in your POW camp for a long time to oppress the prisoners of war as your representatives to attend the explanation, interfering with and threatening the prisoners of war, so that our captured personnel were still under the control and influence of your special agents even during individual explanations, and could not exercise their right to repatriation. While you instructed your special agents to carry out various sabotage activities, you threatened the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Force not to take necessary compulsory measures to sanction the special agents in order to ensure the implementation of the "Terms of Reference," causing our explanation work to never be able to proceed normally.

    But you still attempt to distort the "Terms of Reference" and openly clamor to stop the explanation work on December 22nd and "release the prisoners of war as civilians" on January 21, 1954. Your purpose is obviously to forcibly detain all prisoners of war, which is absolutely not allowed. As early as September 24th, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission proposed that because the explanation arrangements and equipment were not yet complete and could not be prepared by September 26th, the start of the explanation and visits would be postponed for five days, and the explanation period would be extended for five days accordingly. What reason do you have to oppose this decision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission? The "Terms of Reference" clearly stipulates that the explanation work should begin immediately after the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission takes over all prisoners of war, and there should be ninety days of time. Do you think that if you can delay the construction of the explanation equipment for more than ninety days according to your wishes, you can simply cancel the explanation work? Do you think that the explanation work can be allowed to be arbitrarily sabotaged by your special agents in violation of the "Terms of Reference," while the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission cannot, on the contrary, exercise its right to interpret the "Terms of Reference" according to Article 24 of the "Terms of Reference" and make a decision to extend the explanation period? Even after the full ninety days of explanation time, the handling of prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to be repatriated must be submitted to the political conference for solution within thirty days according to the provisions of the "Terms of Reference." Do you think that your unilateral interruption of the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference and the delay in convening the political conference will allow you to do whatever you want and forcibly detain the prisoners of war?

    The purpose of the "Terms of Reference" is to ensure that all prisoners of war have the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated after the armistice. To this end, the "Terms of Reference" stipulates that no force shall be used to obstruct the repatriation of prisoners of war; prisoners of war must be released from the control of the original detaining party; representatives of the country to which the prisoners of war belong must have the freedom and convenience to conduct uninterrupted explanations to all prisoners of war from the date of takeover by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has full power to exercise its legitimate duties, free from interference and influence by any party in any name and in any way. These are the basic clauses of the "Terms of Reference," and these are the indispensable prerequisites of Article 11 of the "Terms of Reference." Only after these prerequisites are fully realized can the termination of the explanation work be announced, and only after the political conference has been discussed for thirty days without a solution can the prisoner of war status of the prisoners of war be lifted and they become civilians. You have sabotaged all these basic clauses in the "Terms of Reference." Your special agents have used inhumane violence to obstruct the repatriation of prisoners of war. Incidents of persecution and murder of prisoners of war have occurred one after another. On December 12th, four more captured personnel on our side who insisted on repatriation in Camp 38 of Tongjang-ri were brutally murdered by your special agents. You directly command special agents to continue to control the POW camp. Intercepted letters from your special agents and communication equipment smuggled by you into the POW camp have long exposed your criminal behavior to the world. You arbitrarily sabotage the explanation work, so that our explanation work could only be carried out seven times until December 20th, and even in these seven times, it could not proceed normally. According to my preliminary report, even in our explanation work that has just resumed today, your special agents are still carrying out various sabotage activities. You openly threaten the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission with force not to take effective measures to ensure the implementation of the "Terms of Reference." These are all shameful acts of you, once again, breaking the agreement you signed after forcibly abducting more than 27,000 of our captured personnel. You have thoroughly sabotaged the "Terms of Reference," and the prerequisites of Article 11 of the "Terms of Reference" have thus been completely destroyed. The current issue is not the termination of the explanation work, but to ensure that the explanation work is carried out in accordance with the "Terms of Reference" and the "Working Procedures." It is not your so-called "releasing prisoners of war as civilians," but to ensure that all prisoners of war have the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated. Your special agents and their organizations in the Tongjang-ri POW camp must be thoroughly eliminated. Our explanation work must be guaranteed to be carried out in accordance with the "Terms of Reference" and the "Working Procedures." The ninety days of explanation time must be compensated. The handling of prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to repatriation must be submitted to the political conference for discussion and resolution. Your continued sabotage of the "Terms of Reference" and the political conference will only further expose your conspiracy to create a tense situation in an attempt to forcibly detain prisoners of war, and will never achieve your despicable purpose.

    对美方虐杀战俘和破坏解释工作的罪行
    李相朝向美方提出最强硬抗议
   【新华社开城二十二日电】军事停战委员会朝中代表团十二月二十一日发表公报如下：
    军事停战委员会十二月二十一日举行会议。
    朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将对美方直接指使特务在东场里战俘营内继续不断地虐杀要求遣返的朝中被俘人员、破坏解释工作的罪行，向美方提出最强硬的抗议。李相朝中将提出不容抵赖的具体材料，指控美方长时期以来即在战俘营中布置大批李、蒋特务，包括一大部分曾受过美方关于以暴力统治战俘的专门特务训练的特务在内，并严重违反停战协定，将这批特务混入了东场里战俘营。
    李相朝中将并列举美方破坏朝中方面解释工作的具体事实，严斥美方企图曲解“职权范围”、终止解释工作、扣留我方被俘人员的阴谋。李相朝中将严词指出，美方必须立即终止其特务非法活动，不得继续威胁阻挠中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队采取有效措施彻底肃清美方布置在东场里的特务及其组织，以保证朝中方面的解释工作得以按照
  “职权范围”与“工作细则”的规定进行。李相朝中将并着重指出：朝中方面解释工作的九十天的时间必须予以补足。在九十天的解释工作后尚未行使其遣返权利的战俘之处理问题，必须交由政治会议讨论解决。
  附件一、李相朝中将抗议美方指使特务谋杀
          我方被俘人员的发言如下：
    印度看管部队所截获的你方特务朴东赫所传达的李承晚和王东原的指示信件，早已向全世界揭露了你方直接指使东场里战俘营内你方所布置的特务破坏解释工作，杀害坚持遣返的我方被俘人员的严重罪行。你方在十二月一日的军事停战委员会会议上也不得不承认了这一信件所揭发的事实，但你方并未因此终止你方的非法活动。相反的，你方却指使你方特务变本加厉地以灭绝人性的暴行阻挠我方被俘人员的遣返。十二月十二日，东场里战俘营第三十八号营场内要求遣返的我方被俘人员崔钟俊、朴锡祥、崔泰律、金学顺等四人又为你方特务谋杀。你方特务并公然将他们的尸首放在营场铁丝网的附近示众，威胁其他战俘，使他们不敢申请遣返。这一骇人听闻的残暴谋杀案件，再次揭露了你方特务控制下的战俘营比纳粹集中营有过之而无不及。
    仅就东场里战俘营内已被揭发的谋杀事件而论，自从中立国遣返委员会接管战俘以来，你方特务在你方直接的指使下，已经杀害了十四名我方被俘人员。这是你方汉城特务总部所谓“在内部肃清不服从命令的分子”，“杀掉愿回北部的家伙”的命令的直接结果。对于这一系列的惨无人道的滔天罪行，你方负有完全的责任。
    长时期以来，你方就派遣了大批李承晚与蒋介石的特务，冒充战俘在你方战俘营中欺压迫害我方被俘人员，进行强迫刺字、写血书、打指印等非法活动，稍有反抗的坚持遣返的我方被俘人员都遭到毒打与虐杀。在停战协定签订以前，我方即已向你方提出警告：在不直接遣返的战俘中，除真正战俘以外，凡李承晚、蒋介石所派特务均不得继续混充战俘跟随战俘来到非军事区。但你方不但并未清除混在战俘中的特务，更增派了大批特务混入东场里战俘营。我方在将我方收容下的不直接遣返的你方被俘人员移交中立国遣返委员会时，即将其全部名单交与你方。你方至今拒绝将你方声称为我方被俘人员而移交中立国遣返委员会看管的人员的名单提交我方，其真正原因就是在于你方唯恐你方特务为我方所辨识，否则你方有何理由不将号称是我方被俘人员的名单交与我方？
    但你方这种卑怯的伎俩并不能掩盖你方彻底违反停战协定的罪行，相反地，它只能更暴露了你方是有计划地派遣大批特务混入东场里战俘营，继续维持你方的恐怖统治。我方在中立国遣返委员会从你方接管战俘时，即已向中立国遣返委员会提出了你方布置在战俘营中的李、蒋特务的一部分四百余名的名单，其中一大部分曾受过你方关于以暴力统治战俘的专门特务训练。现在事实证明这些特务正是迫害谋杀我方被俘人员的主犯。例如张子龙谋杀案的主谋犯你方特务王福田，就曾在一九五一年四月至七月在东京美军特务训练班受过专门训练后，派到济州岛你方战俘营担任“第三联队副队长”，而现在又混入东场里战俘营第二十四号营场。同一案件的另一主谋犯张遵贤，是你方在济州岛战俘营中所设立的特务机构所谓CIE学校的校长，现已混入东场里战俘营第二十五号营场。你方特务王顺清，于一九五一年五月在东京美军特务训练班受专门训练毕业后，即被派往济州岛战俘营担任“第一联队长”，而现在也化名张玉清混入了东场里战俘营第十七号营场，负责指挥谋杀战俘和破坏解释的罪恶活动。你方特务赵开文、锺志伟、赵金钟，都曾在一九五二年四月在东京美军特务训练班受过专门训练，现已分别混入东场里战俘营第十二号、第二十五号、第四十五号各营场。又如现在混在东场里战俘营第四十号营场内的池基哲与韩银松；美军第六十四野战医院围场内的金成禄；第四十九号营场内的文重浩；第五十二号营场内的于永焕与李芝深；以及第三十八号营场谋杀案凶手之一的金正浩，都是你方派遣在战俘营中的李承晚特务。你方曾在这个会上和关于政治会议问题的双方会谈的会上，硬说你方并无特务在东场里战俘营中。我现在要问你，你们能否认我们提出的这些蒋、李特务是曾在你方东京特务学校受过训练的老牌特务吗？你们能否认他们是直接受你方李承晚、元容德以及蒋匪所谓驻南朝鲜大使馆的王东原指挥的吗？你们能否认他们用以进行非法联系的收报机是你方“陆军八二三九部队第一广播出版队”提供的吗？你们能否认这些特务和你们联系用的军邮五百号是和克拉克、赫尔将军总部的军邮同一个号码吗？我在这里所举的事实还只是个别的例证，对于你方派遣特务混入战俘营维持你方恐怖统治的事实，我方掌握有不容你方抵赖的大量的具体材料。
    我现在正式指控你方是谋杀我方被俘人员的杀人犯。我向你提出最强硬的抗议。我要求你方立即终止你方特务的非法活动，同时不再藉口所谓不得使用武力，阻挠中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队采取有效措施彻底肃清你方布置在东场里的特务及其组织，以保证我方实现九十天的解释工作。
    附件二、李相朝中将斥责美方破坏解释工作、
    阴谋片面处理战俘的发言如下：
    对于东场里战俘营我方解释工作的一再中断与停顿，决不容许你方逃避责任。早在战俘移交中立国遣返委员会以前，你方就积极布置了破坏解释工作的种种步骤。在中立国遣返委员会接管战俘后，你方即拖延解释营场的修建，提出荒谬的修建所需时间，蓄意拖延解释工作的开始。只是在我方的彻底揭露和中立国遣返委员会的坚决反对下，你方才不得不最后收回了你方所提的荒谬的修建所需时间，按照中立国遣返委员会的要求修建了解释营场，但已使解释工作推迟了十九天，到十月十五日才能开始。自从我方解释工作开始以来，你方更直接指使特务千方百计地破坏解释工作。你方特务不让朝鲜人民军被俘人员听取解释，使我方解释工作在十月十六日、十月十七日的上午以及从十月十八日起一直到十月三十日的期间根本不能进行。印度看管部队所截获的你方特务信件，完全证明了你方李承晚本人和南朝鲜所谓宪兵总司令官元容德直接指挥混入朝鲜人民军被俘人员中的特务，在一切安排妥当前，不准朝鲜人民军被俘人员出席听取解释。你方特务破坏为集体解释而进行的广播，使我方解释工作在十一月二日又一次不能进行。你方特务抗拒中立国遣返委员会关于隔离已经解释与未经解释的战俘的规定，使我方解释工作自十一月六日起陷入长期停顿。我方曾以极大的忍耐进行各种努力，在十一月十六日试图再次进行解释工作，但在你方特务肆无忌惮地抗拒隔离的情况下，我方解释工作自十一月十七日起到十二月二十日一直不能进行。在此期间，中立国遣返委员会也曾在十二月十日自行安排了隔离营场，但在你方特务的破坏下，仍然未立即执行隔离的规定以迅速恢复我方的解释工作。中立国遣返委员会已经明确指出，在你方直接指使之下的特务之所以抗拒隔离，乃是由于害怕这种隔离的安排会打散其特务组织，有损于他们的特务统治。在这里必须指出：远在你方将战俘移交中立国遣返委员会与印度看管部队之前，你方不仅布置了大批蒋、李特务混入东场里战俘营以破坏解释工作，你方司令官且曾公开同意蒋、李特务不打乱他们的组织，使他们能继续用暴力控制战俘。只是在我方一再的努力下，我方解释工作才在今天又行开始。由于你方的种种破坏，我方的解释工作直至十二月二十日为止只能进行了七次，总共实际解释时间还不足四十三小时。就在这四十三小时之内，你方还指使特务挟持战俘在解释帐篷内大吵大闹，背诵咒语。你方以长期盘踞在你方战俘营中欺压战俘的李、蒋特务为你方代表，公然出席解释，干扰和威胁战俘，使我方被俘人员即使在个别解释时仍然处于你方特务的控制和影响之下，不能行使其遣返权利。你方一面指使特务进行种种破坏活动，一面威胁中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队不得采取必要的强制手段制裁特务以保证“职权范围”的实施，致使我方解释工作始终没有能够正常进行。
    但你方却还企图曲解“职权范围”，公然叫嚣在十二月二十二日停止解释工作，在一九五四年一月二十一日“释放战俘为平民”。你方的目的显然在于强迫扣留全部战俘，这是绝对不能容许的。中立国遣返委员会早在九月二十四日即已提出：由于解释的安排与设备尚未完备，九月二十六日不能准备完竣，因此将解释与访问的开始推延五天，并将解释期限顺延五天。你方有什么理由来反对中立国遣返委员会的这一决定？“职权范围”明确规定：解释工作应在中立国遣返委员会接管全部战俘后即行开始，并应有九十天的时间，难道你们认为如果你们能够按照你们的愿望将解释设备的修建拖过九十天的话，就可以根本取消解释工作吗？难道你们认为解释工作可听凭你方违反“职权范围”指使特务恣意予以破坏，而中立国遣返委员会却反而不能根据“职权范围”第二十四款解释“职权范围”之权，作出顺延解释期限的决定吗？就是在充分的九十天的解释时间之后，未行使被遣返权利的战俘的处理问题，根据“职权范围”的规定，也必须交由政治会议在三十天内设法解决。难道你方认为你方片面中断关于政治会议问题的双方会谈，拖延政治会议的召开，就可以让你方为所欲为，强迫扣留战俘吗？
      “职权范围”的目的，就在于保证全部战俘在停战之后有机会行使其被遣返的权利。为此，“职权范围”规定：对战俘不得使用武力阻挠其遣返；战俘必须从原拘留一方的控制下释放出来；战俘所属国家的代表必须有自由与便利自中立国遣返委员会接管之日起，不中断地向全部战俘进行解释，而中立国遣返委员会有充分的权力行使其合法职责，不受任何一方以任何名义和任何方式的干涉和影响。这是“职权范围”的基本条款，这是“职权范围”第十一款的不可或缺的前提，只是在这些前提充分实现之后，才能宣布解释工作的终止，才能在经过政治会议进行三十天的讨论而得不到解决的情况下，宣布解除战俘们的战俘身份，使之成为平民。你方破坏了“职权范围”中所有这些基本的条款，你方特务以惨无人道的暴力阻挠战俘遣返，迫害、谋杀战俘的事件层出不穷地发生。十二月十二日，东场里三十八号营场内又有坚持遣返的我方被俘人员四名惨遭你方特务所杀害。你方直接指挥特务继续控制战俘营，截获的你方特务信件和你方偷运入战俘营的通讯器材，早已向全世界暴露了你方的罪恶行为。你方恣意破坏解释工作，使我方解释工作直至十二月二十日为止只能进行了七次，而在这七次中也并未能够正常进行。根据我所得到的初步报告，就在今天刚刚恢复的我方解释工作中，你方特务仍然在进行着种种的破坏。你方公开以武力威胁中立国遣返委员会不得采取有效措施保证“职权范围”的实施，这些都是你方继强迫劫持二万七千余名我方被俘人员后，又一次背信弃义地破坏你方自己所签订的协议的可耻行为。你方彻底地破坏了
  “职权范围”，“职权范围”第十一款的前提从而已被破坏无遗。目前的问题不是解释工作的终止，而是保证解释工作按照“职权范围”与“工作细则”进行，不是你方所谓“释放战俘为平民”，而是保证全部战俘有机会行使其被遣返的权利。你方在东场里战俘营的特务及其组织必须彻底予以肃清，我方解释工作必须保证其按照“职权范围”与“工作细则”进行，九十天的解释时间必须予以补足，未行使其遣返权利的战俘的处理问题必须交由政治会议讨论和解决。你方继续破坏“职权范围”、政治会议，将只能进一步地暴露你方制造紧张局面企图强迫扣留战俘的阴谋，而决不能实现你方的卑鄙目的。
