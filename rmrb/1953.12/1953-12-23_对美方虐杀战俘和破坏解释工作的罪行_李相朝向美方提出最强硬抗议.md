Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 22nd. The Korean-Chinese delegation to the Military Armistice Commission issued the following communiqu√© on December 21st:

    The Military Armistice Commission held a meeting on December 21st.

    Major General Li Sang-jo, Chief Commissioner of the Korean-Chinese side, lodged the strongest protest with the US side against the crimes of directly instructing special agents to continuously murder Korean-Chinese prisoners of war demanding repatriation and sabotaging explanation work within the Tongjang-ri POW camp. Major General Li Sang-jo presented undeniable specific materials, accusing the US side of deploying a large number of Rhee and Chiang agents in the POW camp for a long time, including a large number of agents who had received specialized US training in violently controlling prisoners of war, and of seriously violating the armistice agreement by mixing this group of agents into the Tongjang-ri POW camp.

    Major General Li Sang-jo also listed specific facts of the US side's sabotage of the Korean-Chinese side's explanation work, sternly denouncing the US side's conspiracy to distort the "Terms of Reference," terminate the explanation work, and detain our captured personnel. Major General Li Sang-jo sternly pointed out that the US side must immediately cease its special agents' illegal activities and must not continue to threaten and obstruct the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Force from taking effective measures to thoroughly eliminate the US-deployed special agents and their organizations in Tongjang-ri, in order to ensure that the Korean-Chinese side's explanation work can be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the "Terms of Reference" and "Working Procedures." Major General Li Sang-jo also emphasized that the ninety days of explanation work for the Korean-Chinese side must be compensated. The handling of prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to repatriation after the ninety days of explanation work must be submitted to the political conference for discussion and resolution.

    Attachment 1: Statement by Major General Li Sang-jo Protesting the US Side's Instruction of Special Agents to Murder Our Captured Personnel:

    The instructions from Syngman Rhee and Wang Dongyuan conveyed by your special agent Park Dong-hyuk, intercepted by the Indian Custodial Force, have already revealed to the world the serious crimes of your direct instruction of special agents deployed by you in the Tongjang-ri POW camp to sabotage the explanation work and murder our captured personnel who insist on repatriation. At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on December 1st, you had to admit the facts revealed in this letter, but you did not terminate your illegal activities as a result. On the contrary, you instructed your special agents to intensify their inhuman atrocities to obstruct the repatriation of our captured personnel. On December 12th, Choi Jong-jun, Park Seok-sang, Choi Tae-yul, Kim Hak-soon, and other four captured personnel on our side who demanded repatriation in camp No. 38 of the Tongjang-ri POW camp were murdered by your special agents. Your special agents openly placed their corpses near the barbed wire of the camp to show the public, threatening other prisoners of war and preventing them from applying for repatriation. This shocking and brutal murder case once again revealed that the POW camp under your special agents' control is worse than a Nazi concentration camp.

    Speaking only of the murder incidents that have been exposed in the Tongjang-ri POW camp, since the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission took over the prisoners of war, your special agents, under your direct instructions, have murdered fourteen of our captured personnel. This is the direct result of the order from your Seoul Special Agent Headquarters to "clean up internally those who disobey orders" and "kill those who want to return to the North." You bear full responsibility for this series of inhumane and heinous crimes.

    For a long time, you have dispatched a large number of Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek's special agents, pretending to be prisoners of war in your POW camp to oppress and persecute our captured personnel, and engage in illegal activities such as forced tattooing, writing blood letters, and making fingerprints. Our captured personnel who insisted on repatriation with the slightest resistance were beaten and murdered. Before the signing of the armistice agreement, we warned you that among the prisoners of war who were not directly repatriated, all special agents sent by Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek must not continue to masquerade as prisoners of war and follow the prisoners of war to the demilitarized zone. However, you not only failed to remove the special agents mixed in with the prisoners of war, but also sent a large number of special agents to mix into the Tongjang-ri POW camp. When we handed over the non-directly repatriated prisoners of war on your side under our custody to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, we submitted their entire list to you. You have so far refused to submit to us the list of personnel who you claim are our captured personnel and handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for custody. The real reason is that you are afraid that your special agents will be identified by us, otherwise, what reason do you have not to hand over the list of those claimed to be our captured personnel to us?

    But your cowardly tricks cannot conceal your crime of thoroughly violating the armistice agreement. On the contrary, it can only further expose that you have planned to send a large number of special agents to mix into the Tongjang-ri POW camp to continue to maintain your reign of terror. When we handed over the prisoners of war to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission from you, we submitted to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission a list of more than 400 of the Rhee and Chiang agents you deployed in the POW camp, a large part of whom had received your special agent training on violently ruling prisoners of war. Now, the facts have proved that these special agents are the principal culprits in persecuting and murdering our captured personnel. For example, Wang Futian, the mastermind of the Zhang Zilong murder case and your special agent, was sent to your Jeju Island POW camp as the "Deputy Captain of the Third Regiment" after receiving special training at the US military special agent training class in Tokyo from April to July 1951, and is now mixed into camp No. 24 of the Tongjang-ri POW camp. Zhang Zunxian, another mastermind of the same case, was the principal of the so-called CIE school, a special agent organization established by you in the Jeju Island POW camp, and has now mixed into camp No. 25 of the Tongjang-ri POW camp. Your special agent Wang Shunqing was sent to the Jeju Island POW camp as the "First Regiment Commander" after graduating from a special training program at the US military special agent training class in Tokyo in May 1951, and has now also mixed into camp No. 17 of the Tongjang-ri POW camp under the pseudonym Zhang Yuqing, responsible for directing the criminal activities of murdering prisoners of war and sabotaging explanations. Your special agents Zhao Kaiwen, Zhong Zhiwei, and Zhao Jinzhong all received special training at the US military special agent training class in Tokyo in April 1952 and have now mixed into camps No. 12, No. 25, and No. 45 of the Tongjang-ri POW camp, respectively. Furthermore, Chi Gicheol and Han Eun-song, who are now mixed in camp No. 40 of the Tongjang-ri POW camp; Kim Seong-rok in the enclosure of the US 64th Field Hospital; Wen Zhonghao in camp No. 49; Yu Yonghwan and Li Jiseon in camp No. 52; and Kim Jeongho, one of the murderers in the camp No. 38 murder case, are all Syngman Rhee special agents sent by you to the POW camp. You insisted at this meeting and at the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference that you had no special agents in the Tongjang-ri POW camp. I now want to ask you, can you deny that these Chiang and Rhee special agents we have presented are veteran special agents who have been trained at your Tokyo special agent school? Can you deny that they are directly directed by your Syngman Rhee, Won Yong-deok, and Wang Dongyuan of the Chiang bandit's so-called embassy in South Korea? Can you deny that the receiver they use for illegal contact is provided by your "Army 8239 Unit First Broadcasting and Publishing Team"? Can you deny that the military mail number 500 used by these special agents to contact you is the same number as the military mail of Generals Clark and Hull's headquarters? The facts I have cited here are only individual examples. We have a large amount of concrete materials that cannot be denied by you regarding the fact that you sent special agents to mix into the POW camp to maintain your reign of terror.

    I now formally accuse you of being the murderers who murdered our captured personnel. I lodge the strongest protest with you. I demand that you immediately cease the illegal activities of your special agents, and at the same time, stop using the so-called prohibition of the use of force as an excuse to obstruct the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Force from taking effective measures to thoroughly eliminate the special agents and their organizations that you have deployed in Tongjang-ri, so as to ensure that we can carry out the ninety-day explanation work.

    Attachment 2: Statement by Major General Li Sang-jo Rebuking the US Side for Sabotaging the Explanation Work and Conspiring to Unilaterally Handle Prisoners of War:

    You are not allowed to evade responsibility for the repeated interruptions and suspensions of our explanation work in the Tongjang-ri POW camp. As early as before the transfer of prisoners of war to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, you actively deployed various steps to sabotage the explanation work. After the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission took over the prisoners of war, you delayed the construction of the explanation camp, proposed absurd construction time requirements, and deliberately delayed the start of the explanation work. Only after our thorough exposure and the firm opposition of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission did you have to finally withdraw the absurd construction time you proposed and construct the explanation camp according to the requirements of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, but this had already delayed the explanation work by nineteen days, and it could not begin until October 15th. Since the beginning of our explanation work, you have directly instructed your special agents to do everything possible to sabotage the explanation work. Your special agents did not allow the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army to listen to the explanation, so that our explanation work could not be carried out at all on the morning of October 16th and October 17th, and from October 18th to October 30th. The letters of your special agents intercepted by the Indian Custodial Force fully proved that Syngman Rhee himself and Won Yong-deok, the so-called commander-in-chief of the South Korean Gendarmerie, directly commanded the special agents mixed into the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army not to attend the explanation until all arrangements were in place. Your special agents sabotaged the broadcast for collective explanations, causing our explanation work to be unable to proceed again on November 2nd. Your special agents resisted the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's regulations on isolating the explained and unexplained prisoners of war, causing our explanation work to fall into a long-term suspension from November 6th. We have made various efforts with great patience, and tried to carry out the explanation work again on November 16th, but in the face of the unbridled resistance to isolation by your special agents, our explanation work could not be carried out from November 17th to December 20th. During this period, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission also independently arranged an isolation camp on December 10th, but under the sabotage of your special agents, the isolation regulations were still not immediately implemented to quickly restore our explanation work. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has clearly pointed out that the reason why the special agents under your direct instruction resist isolation is because they are afraid that this isolation arrangement will disrupt their special agent organization and damage their special agent rule. It must be pointed out here that long before you handed over the prisoners of war to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Force, you not only deployed a large number of Chiang and Rhee special agents to mix into the Tongjang-ri POW camp to sabotage the explanation work, but your commander also publicly agreed that the Chiang and Rhee special agents would not disrupt their organization so that they could continue to control the prisoners of war with violence. Only after our repeated efforts was our explanation work resumed today. Due to your various sabotage activities, our explanation work could only be carried out seven times until December 20th, and the total actual explanation time was less than forty-three hours. Within these forty-three hours, you also instructed your special agents to kidnap prisoners of war to make a lot of noise in the explanation tents and recite spells. You openly sent the Rhee and Chiang special agents who had been entrenched in your POW camp for a long time to oppress the prisoners of war as your representatives to attend the explanation, interfering with and threatening the prisoners of war, so that our captured personnel were still under the control and influence of your special agents even during individual explanations, and could not exercise their right to repatriation. While you instructed your special agents to carry out various sabotage activities, you threatened the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Force not to take necessary compulsory measures to sanction the special agents in order to ensure the implementation of the "Terms of Reference," causing our explanation work to never be able to proceed normally.

    But you still attempt to distort the "Terms of Reference" and openly clamor to stop the explanation work on December 22nd and "release the prisoners of war as civilians" on January 21, 1954. Your purpose is obviously to forcibly detain all prisoners of war, which is absolutely not allowed. As early as September 24th, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission proposed that because the explanation arrangements and equipment were not yet complete and could not be prepared by September 26th, the start of the explanation and visits would be postponed for five days, and the explanation period would be extended for five days accordingly. What reason do you have to oppose this decision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission? The "Terms of Reference" clearly stipulates that the explanation work should begin immediately after the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission takes over all prisoners of war, and there should be ninety days of time. Do you think that if you can delay the construction of the explanation equipment for more than ninety days according to your wishes, you can simply cancel the explanation work? Do you think that the explanation work can be allowed to be arbitrarily sabotaged by your special agents in violation of the "Terms of Reference," while the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission cannot, on the contrary, exercise its right to interpret the "Terms of Reference" according to Article 24 of the "Terms of Reference" and make a decision to extend the explanation period? Even after the full ninety days of explanation time, the handling of prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to be repatriated must be submitted to the political conference for solution within thirty days according to the provisions of the "Terms of Reference." Do you think that your unilateral interruption of the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference and the delay in convening the political conference will allow you to do whatever you want and forcibly detain the prisoners of war?

    The purpose of the "Terms of Reference" is to ensure that all prisoners of war have the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated after the armistice. To this end, the "Terms of Reference" stipulates that no force shall be used to obstruct the repatriation of prisoners of war; prisoners of war must be released from the control of the original detaining party; representatives of the country to which the prisoners of war belong must have the freedom and convenience to conduct uninterrupted explanations to all prisoners of war from the date of takeover by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has full power to exercise its legitimate duties, free from interference and influence by any party in any name and in any way. These are the basic clauses of the "Terms of Reference," and these are the indispensable prerequisites of Article 11 of the "Terms of Reference." Only after these prerequisites are fully realized can the termination of the explanation work be announced, and only after the political conference has been discussed for thirty days without a solution can the prisoner of war status of the prisoners of war be lifted and they become civilians. You have sabotaged all these basic clauses in the "Terms of Reference." Your special agents have used inhumane violence to obstruct the repatriation of prisoners of war. Incidents of persecution and murder of prisoners of war have occurred one after another. On December 12th, four more captured personnel on our side who insisted on repatriation in Camp 38 of Tongjang-ri were brutally murdered by your special agents. You directly command special agents to continue to control the POW camp. Intercepted letters from your special agents and communication equipment smuggled by you into the POW camp have long exposed your criminal behavior to the world. You arbitrarily sabotage the explanation work, so that our explanation work could only be carried out seven times until December 20th, and even in these seven times, it could not proceed normally. According to my preliminary report, even in our explanation work that has just resumed today, your special agents are still carrying out various sabotage activities. You openly threaten the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission with force not to take effective measures to ensure the implementation of the "Terms of Reference." These are all shameful acts of you, once again, breaking the agreement you signed after forcibly abducting more than 27,000 of our captured personnel. You have thoroughly sabotaged the "Terms of Reference," and the prerequisites of Article 11 of the "Terms of Reference" have thus been completely destroyed. The current issue is not the termination of the explanation work, but to ensure that the explanation work is carried out in accordance with the "Terms of Reference" and the "Working Procedures." It is not your so-called "releasing prisoners of war as civilians," but to ensure that all prisoners of war have the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated. Your special agents and their organizations in the Tongjang-ri POW camp must be thoroughly eliminated. Our explanation work must be guaranteed to be carried out in accordance with the "Terms of Reference" and the "Working Procedures." The ninety days of explanation time must be compensated. The handling of prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to repatriation must be submitted to the political conference for discussion and resolution. Your continued sabotage of the "Terms of Reference" and the political conference will only further expose your conspiracy to create a tense situation in an attempt to forcibly detain prisoners of war, and will never achieve your despicable purpose.
