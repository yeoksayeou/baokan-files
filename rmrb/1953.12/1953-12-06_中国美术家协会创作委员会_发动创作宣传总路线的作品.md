The Creative Committee of the Chinese Artists Association convened a symposium on December 1st to mobilize artists to vigorously publicize China's general line for the transition period through artistic creation. Over forty artists from Beijing attended, including Jiang Feng, Wu Zuoren, Ye Qianyu, Gu Yuan, Li Hua, Wang Shikui, Dong Xiwen, Yu Feian, Jiang Yan, and A Lao. The symposium was presided over by Cai Ruohong, who called on artists to attach importance to the publicity of the general line, avoid any indifference, immediately start creating, and provide a large number of works for newspapers and magazines to publish and for propagandists in various regions to use. Comrade Shao Yu also comprehensively conveyed the various reports on the general line.

Recently, artists have begun to study China's general line for the transition period, and some have already begun to create works to publicize the general line. For example, the People's Fine Arts Publishing House's creation studio is creating New Year pictures, posters, and comic strips with themes such as encouraging farmers to sell surplus grain, participate in mutual aid and cooperation, and strengthen the worker-peasant alliance. The comic strip newspaper has also sent painters to the countryside to collect materials. The North China People's Publishing House is creating comic strips with content such as "The Benefits of Selling Surplus Grain to the State" and has already completed a New Year picture titled "This Grain is Sold to the State." The Beijing People's Fine Arts Studio has also begun to draw some comic strips, some of which have been completed. The Painting Department of the Central Academy of Fine Arts is organizing teachers and students to go to the countryside collectively, in addition to preparing to create propaganda posters, and plans to compile several sets of puppet shows for mobile publicity during the Spring Festival.

In order to help painters carry out creation in a planned way, the Creative Committee of the Chinese Artists Association decided at the meeting that various art units and artists in Beijing should put forward their plans and opinions, so as to convene another meeting in the coming days to jointly study how to concentrate forces, divide labor for creation, and organize painters to go to the countryside. The painting, printmaking, and cartoon groups of the Creative Committee have all decided to focus their current creative tasks on publicizing the national general line.

    中国美术家协会创作委员会
    发动创作宣传总路线的作品
    中国美术家协会的创作委员会为发动美术家以美术创作大力宣传我国过渡时期总路线，于十二月一日召开了座谈会，在京美术家江丰、吴作人、叶浅予、古元、李桦、王式廓、董希文、于非暗、姜燕、阿老等四十多人都到会参加。座谈会由蔡若虹主持，他号召美术家必须重视总路线的宣传，不应稍有冷淡，要立即动手创作，大量供应各报纸杂志刊用和各地宣传工作者采用。邵宇同志并综合地传达了关于总路线的各次报告。
    最近一个时期，美术家们都已开始学习了我国过渡时期的总路线，有的并已开始创作有关总路线宣传的作品，如人民美术出版社创作室正在创作以鼓励农民出售余粮、参加互助合作和加强工农联盟等为主题的年画、招贴画和连环画；连环画报并已派画家下乡搜集材料。华北人民出版社正在创作“把余粮卖给国家的好处”等内容的连环画，并已完成“这粮食是卖给国家的”年画一张。北京人民美术工作室也已开始绘制一些连环画，有的并已完成。中央美术学院绘画系正在组织师生集体下乡，除准备创作宣传画外，并计划编制傀儡戏若干套，在春节中流动宣传。
    美协创作委员会为了能够帮助画家们有计划地进行创作，会上决定北京各美术单位和美术家提出自己的计划和意见，以便于日内另行召开会议，共同研究如何集中力量分工创作，和组织画家下乡等。创作委员会的绘画、版画、漫画等组，都决定以宣传国家总路线为目前创作任务的中心。
