    The Xishui County Rural Troupe on the Agricultural Production Front
    Hua Yumen
    After agricultural production became the overriding central task in rural areas, the rural troupe of Xishui County, Hubei Province, further implemented the principle of "serving production" in this year's agricultural production and autumn grain collection, and was consolidated and developed.
    Party Branches Must Attach Importance to Leading Rural Troupes
    It has long been proposed that rural troupes should be under the unified leadership of the township Party branches. However, some township Party branches still do not have a clear understanding of the spirit of rural troupes serving production; some are too busy with central work to take care of everything; and a very small number of troupes themselves still have impure elements in their organizational leadership or lack strong leadership, failing to play a role in propaganda and failing to win the attention of the Party branches. Due to the lack of leadership, the troupe was disorganized, the actors were discouraged, and the work was slack. All these situations hindered the development of rural troupes towards the correct path of "singing and entertaining themselves, serving production." Due to the lack of regular and strong leadership, during the summer and autumn transition this year, as soon as the drought resistance work ended and the rice was weeded three times, some rural troupes performed extensively, hindering production. At the same time, due to the lack of new scripts and adapted scripts, the difficulty in popularizing operas, and the failure to absorb nourishment from rich folk music and dance, some troupes performed many old operas with some feudal toxins (such as Sea Snail Lamp, Wujin Ji, Tea Garden Beating, Lazy Pot Burning, etc., Chu operas containing superstitious, erotic, and feudal toxins); the time and performance locations were often the entire night, performing from one district to another, sometimes for more than a dozen nights in a row. Along with this, many masses lavishly treated the actors, which, although satisfying the masses' entertainment needs, did not fully achieve the political effect of enlightening and educating the masses; some operas had a bad influence and caused waste of manpower, materials, and financial resources.
    This situation attracted the attention of the Party Committee. The Xishui County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, at the expanded cadre meeting in July, instructed that each township should establish cultural and artistic propaganda tools, such as troupes, blackboard newspaper groups, big-character poster groups, and broadcasting groups, according to the actual situation, specifically led by the propaganda member of the Party branch or the head of the propaganda team. It was also stipulated that the 1st and 15th of each month were fixed propaganda times, and usually small group activities were carried out in a decentralized manner. Before the start of the autumn grain collection work, when each township held an expanded Party branch meeting, the head of the troupe was invited to participate; in the meeting where production base propagandists passed on knowledge, cadres above the actor group leader level were invited to participate. In this way, not only could the literary and artistic propaganda work be closely integrated with the central task, but also the political enthusiasm of the rural troupe members was greatly enhanced. For example, Shi Wenhua, the director of the Wangcheng Township troupe, said:
  "If I don't do it again, I'll really be letting down the Party branch." Many township Party branches sent Party members to participate in the actors' meetings to provide political and ideological guidance. Under the leadership and help of the Party branch, the Baishi Township troupe developed more than a dozen actors and expanded the troupe organization. These facts prove that the reason why the Xishui rural troupe can be consolidated and developed normally is because of the leadership of the Party branch, the propaganda member being specifically responsible, placing the work of leading the rural troupe on the work agenda, and arranging the rural troupe in an appropriate position when deploying the central task. At the same time, all members of the troupe are constantly given political education, so that everyone has a goal to strive for, and the activities of the rural troupe can proceed along a normal path.
    The Rural Troupe is Both a Propaganda Team and a Production Team
    In rural literary and artistic propaganda activities, one of the most prominent and most difficult problems to solve is the contradiction between production and propaganda. Too many literary and artistic activities will inevitably affect production; if no activities are carried out, the propaganda force will be weakened, and the cultural life requirements of the masses cannot be met. Last year, this problem was not solved, which affected the production work of many actors. For example, last year, during the summer and autumn transition, the actors of the Fangfan Township troupe performed in the districts for more than 20 days, performing in every district, resulting in the sweet potatoes planted by the actors being covered in weeds two feet long, and many actors were dissatisfied. Wang Xiangyun, the head of the Malong Township troupe, said: "Last year, we often held meetings, and the meetings for verifying fields and determining production alone lasted more than 20 days in a month. The fields were so barren that they didn't look like fields. The family wife cursed, the masses gossiped, and I felt angry. Everything was bad, and the more I thought about it, the less motivated I was to do it." This year, the leadership called on the actors to participate in production, promote production; participate in mutual aid, and promote mutual aid. Most of the actors in Malong Township participated in mutual aid teams. In Konglong Township's six mutual aid teams, actors served as team leaders in four. Many actors took the lead in waterwheel irrigation, rush planting, waterwheel irrigation of ponds, saving water, and weeding fields. When promoting ammonium sulfate as top dressing, Xie Bingsheng, the head of the Maling Township troupe, borrowed 15 jin of ammonium sulfate for experimentation and mobilized the people in the same village. As a result, all eight households in the village borrowed a total of 130 jin of ammonium sulfate as top dressing.
    Rural troupes participating in production can also draw materials locally, seize typical examples, use real people and real events, and carry out propaganda through big-character posters, blackboard newspapers, broadcasting trumpets, and drum storytelling. For example, Zhou Hongwen, the deputy head of the Baishi Township troupe, used a broadcasting trumpet to promote "seedling transplanting" for drought resistance, which promoted the "seedling transplanting" work.
    After agricultural production becomes the overriding central task in rural areas, rural troupes should also become production teams, specifically achieving "participating in production, promoting production," and "participating in mutual aid, promoting mutual aid." This is one of the fundamental ways to solve the contradiction between production and propaganda.
    Diversify the Activities of Rural Troupes
    In order to prevent the slogans of "participating in production, promoting production" and "participating in mutual aid, promoting mutual aid" from falling through, the county leadership also proposed: change the activity mode, appropriately divide the troupe into several groups, not perform during busy farming seasons, and usually use small groups to turn stage activities into field activities through oral or simple literary and artistic propaganda forms. For example, the propaganda group organized by Chai Fengjiao and other eight female actors from Kailing Township helped the masses with waterwheel irrigation while promoting the "Ten Measures Duet" and the lyrics published in "Hubei Literature and Art," which was welcomed by the masses.
    However, in some areas, the troupes engaged in small group activities, and all they did were drum storytelling and clapper talks. The masses were tired of listening, and the actors were tired of performing, and the propaganda work was ineffective. This created obstacles to the promotion of small group activities. Therefore, it is necessary to explore and use folk art forms and create more small singing materials. Taking Xishui County alone, the folk art forms are very rich. The Tianqiao Township troupe alone has folk music and dance such as fisherman drums, cymbal playing, double carts, and lion dances. Other areas also have shadow puppetry, silk string gongs and drums, etc., that have not been used. This shows that if we ignore the treasure of folk art, rural literary and artistic activities will inevitably fall into a state of poverty.
    During the autumn grain collection propaganda, small group activities were widely promoted. In addition to performances during the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day, the Baishi, Malong, and other township troupes usually engaged in small group activities, which were very popular among the masses. Many old women said: "The propaganda has come to the house. We have watched the opera and listened to the policies. It is really good." Some farmers hurriedly offered tea and water, fearing that the actors would be thirsty.
    Rural production work is tense. The slack winter season must be turned into a busy winter, and water conservancy projects must be built during the Spring Festival. The actors themselves are farmers, and they should also do a good job in their own production. Too many large-scale stage activities will inevitably affect production. Facts have proved that not holding or holding fewer large-scale opera performances, holding more folk music and dance activities, and using more flexible small group activity forms to diversify the activities of rural troupes will not only not affect production but also be loved by the masses.
    Hold Small-Scale Performances and Training Courses to Improve the Level of Rural Troupes
    This year, the Xishui County rural troupes held a small-scale performance during the Dragon Boat Festival, based on production bases. The purpose of the performance was to further implement the principle of the troupe serving production, improve the professional level of the troupe, strengthen unity with each other, and meet the cultural life requirements of the masses. These purposes were all achieved. After the Wanggang Township troupe participated in the performance, they reviewed and criticized the reasons for performing large operas: First, they simply understood the principle of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new," thinking that any opera could be performed, even operas with feudal, superstitious, and erotic toxins; second, they did not seriously study their profession and were perfunctory when studying; third, performing large operas, dressed in red and green, could show off. After discussion, everyone agreed that these practices were not right. They also studied the People's Daily article "Several Questions Concerning Rural Amateur Troupes," and the members of the troupe more clearly realized that rural troupes should serve production. After that, they did not perform large operas. While satisfying the cultural life of the masses, the performance also educated the masses. After a farmer in Victory Township watched the opera "Unraveling the Knot," the ideological knot of not wanting to join the mutual aid team was untied, and he actively participated in the mutual aid team. Through the performance, models were correctly established, and the political and ideological level of general troupes was educated and improved. For example, the Guankou Guidance Area selected the Kailing Troupe as a model, and the surrounding troupes actively learned their spirit of decentralized propaganda and actively serving production. When the rice was weeded three times, the County Cultural Center went deep into the countryside and, based on the troupe guidance committee, held two sessions of troupe training courses. The training courses played a great role in consolidating the troupe, and actors from troupes in many areas of the county requested to do this. In the future, it will continue to be held at appropriate times to continuously improve the ideological, political, and professional level of the members of the rural troupe.
    In order to prepare for vigorously promoting the national general line, the county convened a meeting of rural troupe actors and drum storytelling artists from November 18th to 24th to study policies and study six key singing materials. This meeting first illuminated the eyes of the core members of the rural troupe themselves. Yang Wenlang, an actor from the Victory Troupe in Lidian District, said: "I have more than two dan of surplus grain myself. If I didn't come to study, I wouldn't want to sell it. This time, I understand the idea." When exposing the spontaneous tendencies of rural small commodity producers, Chen Shaoxiang, a female actor from the Xufan Troupe in Bahe District, said: "Taking the old road will affect the collapse of the mutual aid team. My mutual aid team originally had four middle peasants and five poor peasants. Last year, there was a bumper harvest, and the middle peasants were unwilling to help each other. They lent the grain to others and didn't lend it to the poor peasants, so the mutual aid team collapsed."
    After studying the general line, the Xishui County rural troupe will play a greater role in the task of promoting the general line to the vast number of farmers.

    在农业生产战线上的浠水县农村剧团
    华于门
    农业生产成为农村压倒一切的中心任务以后，湖北省浠水县的农村剧团，在今年农业生产和秋征等工作中，进一步地贯彻了“为生产服务”的方针，得到了巩固与发展。
    党支部要重视领导农村剧团
    农村剧团由乡党支部统一领导，这是早就提出来的问题，但是有部分乡的党支部对农村剧团是为生产服务的精神还不够明确；有的因忙于中心工作，难于照顾全面；有极少数剧团的本身在组织领导方面仍有不纯现象或领导不强，宣传没有起到作用，争取不到党支部的重视。剧团由于缺乏领导，表现组织涣散，演员泄气，工作松懈。这些情况，都妨碍了农村剧团向“自唱自乐、为生产服务”的正确道路发展。由于缺乏经常的坚强领导，今年夏秋之交，抗旱工作才结束，稻谷薅了三道脚的时候，有些农村剧团就大量演戏，妨碍了生产。同时，由于新剧本和改编剧本缺乏和歌剧的不易普及，又没有从丰富的民间音乐舞蹈中吸取养料，部分剧团就演出不少带有一些封建毒素的旧戏（如海螺灯、乌金记、打茶园、懒烧锅等含有迷信、色情、封建毒素的楚剧）；时间和演出地点，往往是整夜，这个选区演到那个选区，有的连演十几夜。与此相随，很多群众大请其客，虽然满足了群众的娱乐要求，但并没有完全收到启发和教育群众的政治效果；有些戏反而起了坏影响，并造成了人力、物力、财力上的浪费。
    这种情况，引起了党委的重视。中共浠水县委在七月间县扩大干部会上布置：各乡应根据实际情况，把文化艺术宣传工具建立为剧团组、黑板报组、大字报组、广播组等组织，具体由党支部宣传委员或宣传员大组长领导。又规定了每月一日和十五日是固定宣传时间，平常就化整为零地进行小组活动。在秋征工作开始以前，各乡召开扩大党支部会议时，吸收剧团团长参加；生产基点宣传员传授会中，吸收演员组长以上干部参加。这样，不但文艺宣传工作能够紧密结合中心，农村剧团团员们的政治热情也大大提高。如望城乡剧团导演施文华说：
  “我再不搞，实在对不起党支部。”很多乡党支部在演员开会时，就派党员参加进行政治思想指导。白石乡剧团在党支部的领导和帮助下，发展了十几个演员，扩大了剧团组织。这些事实证明：浠水农村剧团之所以能够得到巩固与正常发展，就是由于党支部的领导，宣传委员具体负责，把领导农村剧团的工作放在工作日程上，在布置中心工作时，能把农村剧团安排在一个适当的岗位上。同时，对剧团的所有成员，又不断地进行政治教育，使大家有了奋斗目标，农村剧团的活动就能循着正常的道路前进。
    农村剧团是宣传队又是生产队
    在农村文艺宣传活动中，最突出的也是最难解决的问题之一，即是生产与宣传的矛盾。过多的文艺活动，势必影响生产；不搞活动，又削弱了宣传力量，也不能满足群众文化生活要求。去年因没有解决这一问题，影响了很多演员的生产工作。如方畈乡剧团去年夏秋之交，演员在选区演了二十多天的戏，个个选区都演到了，结果演员种的山药长了二尺多长的草，很多演员不满意。马垅乡剧团团长王祥云说：“去年经常开会，光查田定产一个月开了二十多天的会，田地都荒得不像个样儿，家庭老婆骂，群众说怪话，自己呕气，几头不好，越想越没有劲搞。”今年领导上号召演员要参加生产，宣传生产；参加互助，宣传互助。马垅乡全乡演员大部分参加了互助组。孔垅乡六个互助组，演员当组长的有四个。许多演员都带头车水、抢插、车水灌塘、节约用水薅田。在推广硫酸錏作追肥时，马岭乡剧团团长谢炳生自己借十五斤硫酸錏作试验，并动员同湾的人，结果全湾八家共借了一百三十斤硫酸錏作追肥。
    农村剧团参加生产，也就能就地取材，抓住典型，用活人活事，通过大字报、黑板报、广播筒、鼓书等形式进行宣传。如白石乡剧团副团长周宏文用广播筒宣传“掇秧”抗旱，推动了“掇秧”工作。
    在农业生产成为农村压倒一切的中心任务以后，农村剧团就要同时也成为生产队伍，具体做到
  “参加生产，宣传生产”，“参加互助，宣传互助”。这才是解决生产与宣传的矛盾的根本办法之一。
    使农村剧团的活动多样化
    为了使“参加生产，宣传生产”、“参加互助，宣传互助”的口号不致落空，县领导上又提出：改变活动方式，把剧团适当分成若干小组，农忙时不演出，平时就通过小组，用口头或简单的文艺宣传形式，把舞台活动变为田畈活动。如快岭乡的女演员柴凤姣等八人组织的宣传小组，一边帮群众车水，一边宣传“十项措施对唱”和“湖北文艺”发表的唱词，受到了群众的欢迎。
    但是，有些地区的剧团搞小组活动，搞来搞去都是鼓书、快板，群众听厌了，演员也演腻了，宣传工作没有效果。这就给推广小组活动造成了障碍。因此，就必须发掘和运用民间文艺形式，多创作小型演唱材料。单以浠水一县来说，民间艺术形式就很丰富，仅田桥乡剧团就有渔鼓、敲盘子、双推车、狮舞等民间音乐舞蹈。其他地区也还有皮影子、丝弦锣鼓等没有运用。这说明了如果我们忽视了民间艺术的宝藏，农村文艺活动必然陷于贫乏状态。
    秋征宣传时，普遍地推广了小组活动，白石、马垅等乡剧团除了中秋、国庆节演出外，平常都是搞小组活动，很受广大群众欢迎。许多老婆婆说：“宣传到屋里来了，戏也看了，政策也听了，实在是好。”有的农民还连忙拿茶拿水招呼，怕演员渴了。
    农村生产工作是紧张的，冬闲要变成冬忙，春节还要兴修水利。演员本身是农民，他们也应该搞好自己生产。过多的搞大型的舞台活动，必然会影响生产。事实证明：不搞或少搞大型的戏曲演出，多搞民间音乐舞蹈活动，多运用灵活的小组活动形式，使农村剧团的活动多样化，是既不会影响生产，又为群众喜爱的。
    举行小型会演和轮训班  提高农村剧团的水平
    浠水县全县农村剧团，在今年端阳节举行了一次以生产基点为单位的小型会演。会演的目的在于能进一步贯彻剧团为生产服务的方针，提高剧团业务水平，加强彼此团结，满足群众文化生活要求。这些目的都达到了。汪岗乡剧团通过会演后，检讨和批判了演大戏的原因是：第一、简单地理解“百花齐放，推陈出新”的方针，认为什么戏都能演，有封建、迷信、色情的毒素的戏也可以演；第二、没有认真学习业务，学习时又敷衍了事；第三、演大戏穿得红红绿绿，可以出风头。经过讨论后，大家都认为这些作法是不对头的，又学习了人民日报“关于农村业余剧团的几个问题”一文，团员们更明确认识了农村剧团要为生产服务。以后就没演大戏。会演在满足群众文化生活的同时，也教育了群众。胜利乡有个农民看了“解疙?”剧后，不愿参加互助组的思想疙瘩解开了，积极参加了互助组。通过会演，还正确树立了榜样，教育并提高了一般剧团的政治思想水平。如关口辅导区评选了快岭剧团作为模范，周围剧团都积极学习他们分散宣传、积极为生产服务的精神。县文化馆在秧薅三道脚时，深入到农村中去，以剧团辅导委员会为基础，举办了两期剧团轮训班。轮训班对巩固剧团起了很大作用，全县很多地区的剧团演员都要求这样搞。今后在适当时机内还要继续举办，以不断地提高农村剧团成员的思想、政治和业务水平。
    为了准备大张旗鼓宣传国家总路线，县里从十一月十八日到二十四日，又召开了农村剧团演员和鼓书艺人们的会议，学习政策，又研究了六个重点的演唱材料。这次会议，首先照亮了农村剧团骨干分子自己的眼睛。里店区胜利剧团演员杨文朗说：“我自己有两石多余粮，如果不来学习，也是不想卖的，这回思想通了。”在揭发农村小商品生产者自发倾向的时候，巴河区徐畈剧团女演员陈少香说：“走旧道路，影响互助组也垮台。我那个互助组，原来有四户中农，五户贫农，去年丰产，中农就不愿意互助了，把谷子放给人家，也不借给贫农，结果互助组就搞垮了。”
    学习了总路线以后，浠水全县农村剧团将要在向广大农民群众宣传总路线的任务中，发挥更大的作用。
