    In a situation where the capitalist world market further declined and the struggle among capitalist countries for sales markets became increasingly acute, Britain's foreign trade situation in 1953 was dismal.
    In order to expand exports and reduce the trade deficit, the British government had taken a series of steps since the beginning of the year in an attempt to change the deteriorating export trade situation of 1952. Initially, Britain also attempted to enter the U.S. domestic market, requesting the United States to reduce tariff barriers so that British goods could expand sales in the U.S. market, thereby resolving the long-standing dollar shortage crisis in Britain's foreign trade, which had become a weakness held by Washington. However, this request from Britain was flatly rejected by the United States. Despite the U.S. government officials saying many nice words expressing sympathy, with the development of the domestic economic crisis in the United States, calls for raising tariffs became increasingly louder.
    After British Foreign Secretary Eden and Chancellor of the Exchequer Butler received a cold shoulder in Washington in March of this year when they put forward the slogan "Trade, not Aid," the British government had to come up with other ideas and take other measures to increase export trade. The main focus of these measures was to expand trade with Commonwealth countries and Western Europe, and to try to restore Britain's former status in the traditional markets of Latin America and the Near and Middle East.
    Britain first conducted negotiations on trade and payment issues with many Western European countries, including the Scandinavian countries, France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. At the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference held in London in early June this year, Britain also held negotiations with Commonwealth countries on expanding internal trade within the Commonwealth, allowing Commonwealth countries such as Australia and New Zealand to relax some import quotas on British goods.
    In order to enhance its competitive strength in the capitalist world market, Britain also took some specific measures in foreign trade, such as relaxing export credit, reducing interest rates on subsidized export loans, encouraging more investment in the production of export goods, restoring the free markets for copper, zinc, lead, and grains in London, as well as the auction markets for coffee, tea, and wool, to consolidate re-export enterprises and London's international financial activities, and sending trade inspection delegations abroad, etc.
    However, despite Britain's adoption of the above-mentioned measures, due to the increasingly deteriorating sales conditions in the capitalist world and the increasingly fierce struggle for sales markets, and because the British government still followed Washington's policy of restricting trade between the East and the West, Britain's export trade situation did not improve in 1953. According to statistics from "The Economist" magazine, in the first eleven months of this year, the total value of British export goods was 2,358.4 million pounds, a decrease of 15.4 million pounds compared with the same period in 1952; the total value of re-exports was 97.9 million pounds, a decrease of 38.5 million pounds compared with the same period last year. Exports and re-exports decreased by a total of 2.1 percent compared with the same period last year. Although the total import value in the first eleven months of this year decreased by 150 million pounds compared with the same period in 1952, the trade deficit still reached a huge figure of 600 million pounds.
    Among Britain's export goods this year, except for some light industrial manufactured goods such as textiles and chemical manufactures which showed some increase, the rest of the export goods generally declined. Among them, the decline in the output of machinery manufactures—power equipment, vehicles, textile machinery, and agricultural machinery, etc.—and electrical products, etc., which have always been important British exports, was particularly significant.
    The fierce competition in the limited capitalist world market from major capitalist exporting countries such as the United States, West Germany, and Japan has seriously hit Britain's export trade. This is an important reason for the sluggishness of Britain's export trade in 1953. The United States, on the one hand, erected high tariff barriers to prevent foreign goods from entering the U.S. market, and on the other hand, used dumping, export subsidies, and various so-called "aid" methods to promote its surplus goods to foreign markets. West Germany, under the support of the United States, used methods such as lowering prices, shortening delivery times, extending export credit, and reducing taxes on export trade revenue to enter the sterling area and Britain's traditional markets, squeezing out British influence everywhere. The gradual strengthening of Japan's competitive strength in export trade has also made it once again a strong rival to Britain in many markets. In the first ten months of this year, Britain's exports to the "third markets" outside the dollar and sterling areas decreased by 77 million pounds compared with the same period last year, which is the result of Britain's failure in this competition.
    Faced with the shrinking capitalist world market and the fierce attacks from countries such as the United States, West Germany, and Japan, British capitalists mainly relied on further exploiting the laboring people of their own country and colonies, launching a confrontational "export movement." This "movement" temporarily enabled British capitalists to increase exports to the dollar area and Western Europe to some extent. In the recent two months of October and November, the overall export situation in Britain showed a slight improvement. However, the overall export situation in 1953 and the pessimistic views on the future of exports expressed by British officials and bourgeois newspapers show that as long as the British government continues to follow the discriminatory trade policy of the United States, no matter what measures it takes, it will not be able to find a way out of Britain's trade crisis. Therefore, some people in British business circles and their political representatives are now increasingly clearly aware that the only way to completely reverse the unfavorable situation in Britain's foreign trade is to expand equal and mutually beneficial trade between East and West. The progressive people of Britain have long been demanding that Britain implement an independent and autonomous policy and develop trade relations with the peaceful and democratic camp. Their proposition is receiving increasing support.

### 一九五三年英国的对外贸易景况更加惨淡

    一九五三年英国的对外贸易景况更加惨淡
      【新华社讯】在资本主义世界市场情况进一步衰落和资本主义国家间争夺销售市场的斗争日益尖锐的情况下，一九五三年英国的对外贸易景况惨淡。
    为了扩大出口、减少贸易逆差，英国政府自今年开年以来，曾采取了一系列的步骤，企图改变一九五二年出口贸易的恶化状况。最初，英国还企图打入美国国内市场，曾向美国要求减低关税壁垒，以便英国货物得以在美国市场上扩大销售，这样来解救英国对外贸易上长期存在的、成为握在华盛顿手中的一条辫子的美元缺乏的危机。但英国的这一要求遭到了美国的干脆拒绝。尽管美国政府负责官员说了不少表示同情的漂亮话，但是随着美国国内经济危机的发展，要提高关税的呼声却越来越高了。
    当英国外交大臣艾登和财政大臣巴特勒今年三月在华盛顿提出“要贸易，不要援助”的口号讨了一个没趣之后，英国政府不得不另打主意，采取其他增加出口贸易的措施，这些措施的主旨是扩大与英联邦国家和西欧的贸易，并设法恢复英国在拉丁美洲和中近东这些传统市场的旧日地位。
    英国首先与西欧许多国家分别进行了贸易与支付问题的谈判，这些国家有斯堪的纳维亚半岛国家、法国、西德、意大利、比利时、荷兰和瑞士等。今年六月初在伦敦举行的英联邦总理会议上，英国又与联邦国家进行了扩大联邦内部贸易的谈判，使得澳大利亚、新西兰等联邦国家放宽了一些对英国货物的入口限额。
    为了增强在资本主义世界市场上的竞争力量，英国在对外贸易上还采取了一些具体措施，例如放宽出口信贷，减低补贴出口贷款的利息，鼓励向出口货物生产方面作更多的投资，恢复伦敦的铜、锌、铅和谷物的自由市场以及咖啡、茶和羊毛的拍卖市场，以整顿再出口企业和伦敦的国际金融活动，向国外派遣贸易视察团等。
    但是，尽管英国采取了上述的许多措施，由于资本主义世界销售条件的日益恶化，争夺销货市场的斗争日益剧烈，而英国政府仍追随华盛顿的限制东西方贸易的政策，因此一九五三年英国的出口贸易情况并未好转。据“经济学家”杂志的统计，今年头十一个月，英国出口货物总值为二十三亿五千八百四十万英镑，比一九五二年同期减少了一千五百四十万英镑；再出口总值为九千七百九十万英镑，比去年同期减少了三千八百五十万英镑。出口及再出口比去年同期共减少了百分之二点一。今年头十一个月的入口总值虽然比一九五二年同期减少了一亿五千万英镑，但贸易逆差仍达六亿英镑的庞大数字。
    今年英国的出口货物中，除某些轻工业制造品如纺织和化学制造品有了一些增加外，其余的出口货物一般都往下降。其中尤以机器制造品——动力装备、车辆、纺织机器和农业机器等——和电气制品等等英国历来重要出口品的输出下降得比较显著。
    美国、西德和日本等主要资本主义输出国家在有限的资本主义世界市场上的剧烈的竞争，使英国的出口贸易受到严重打击，这是一九五三年英国出口贸易不振的一个重要原因。美国一面高筑关税壁垒，不让外国货物进入美国市场，另方面则利用倾销、出口补贴和各种所谓“援助”的办法，向国外市场推销它的剩余货物。在美国扶植下的西德，利用降低价格、缩短交货日期、放长出口信贷和对出口贸易收益减税等办法，打进英镑区和英国的传统市场，到处排挤英国的势力。日本出口贸易上的竞争力量的逐渐强大，也使它在许多市场上再次成为英国的劲敌。今年头十个月，英国在对美元和英镑区以外的“第三种市场”的出口，比去年同期减少了七千七百万英镑，就是这种竞争中英国失败的结果。
    面对着资本主义世界市场萎缩以及美国、西德和日本等国凶猛进攻的情况，英国资本家今年主要是靠着进一步压榨本国和殖民地的劳动人民，发动了对抗性质的“输出运动”，这一“运动”暂时使英国资本家对美元区和西欧的出口有了一些增加，最近十月、十一月两个月，英国总的出口方面稍见起色。但是一九五三年整个出口情况以及英国官方和资产阶级报刊对出口前途的悲观论调，说明只要英国政府还继续追随美国的歧视性贸易政策，不管它采取什么措施，都不能替英国的贸易危机找到出路。因此，英国一部分企业界人士和他们的政治代表现在也越来越清楚地认识到，要彻底扭转英国对外贸易的不利局势，唯有扩展东西方之间平等、互利的贸易。英国进步人民许久以来一直要求英国实行独立自主的政策，发展与和平民主阵营的贸易关系。他们的这种主张正得到愈来愈多的支持。
