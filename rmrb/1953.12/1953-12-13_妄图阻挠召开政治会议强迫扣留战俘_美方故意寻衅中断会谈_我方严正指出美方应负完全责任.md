Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 12th: The delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China participating in the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference issued a communique as follows:

At the twenty-third meeting of the bilateral talks held today, the other party's representative, Dean, disregarding our opposition, unilaterally announced an indefinite adjournment and abruptly left the meeting. Therefore, the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference, which began in Panmunjom on October 26 this year, have now been interrupted due to the other party's unilateral announcement of an indefinite adjournment.

Dean's attitude at today's meeting showed that undermining the bilateral talks was a long-planned conspiracy by the U.S. side. The U.S. side is clearly trying to use this shameless means of obstruction and sabotage to carry out useless intimidation and blackmail against the Korean-Chinese side, and attempting to prevent the political conference from being convened, so that they can forcibly detain more than 20,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who have not yet been interviewed, and maintain international tension. At the beginning of today's meeting, our representative, Mr. Ki Sok-bok, first spoke, refuting the other party's unreasonable proposal on voting procedures. Ki Sok-bok demanded that Dean clearly answer: Since, according to the other party's proposal, agreements at the political conference should be reached by both sides voting as a unit, and the other party's member states would only be bound when they agreed to a certain agreement and participated in the signing; then even if the other party as a unit agreed to the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea, the U.S. government could still express its disagreement and not be bound, refusing to withdraw troops; even if the other party agreed to a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, the South Korean government could still express its disagreement and not be bound, insisting on "unification by marching north." If this is the case, what is the significance of the agreement reached between the other party as one side and our side? What guarantee does the other party have to ensure that these agreements are implemented? Mr. Ki Sok-bok further questioned, since Dean is the representative of seventeen countries, why is it that when he states here that he can invite neutral countries to participate in the political conference under the conditions he proposed, the Foreign Minister of the South Korean government, Byun Young-tae, whom he claims to represent, fundamentally opposes any neutral countries participating in the political conference? Does Dean's word count, or Byun Young-tae's word count? Does Dean have the right to represent South Korea in this negotiation?

Obviously because he was at a loss for words, Dean completely avoided answering these questions of great importance, calling them "straw men not worth hitting." On the contrary, he spent two and a half hours wantonly spreading rumors and slanders against our side on the issue of prisoners of war, and spoke at length about the absurd proposals of the other party opposing the determination of the agenda and the provision of a secretariat by the United Nations.

At the same time, in order to evade the sharp question raised by our side as to whether he represents South Korea, Dean brazenly declared that if our side agreed to the absurd proposal of the Soviet Union participating in the political conference as a belligerent party, then he could represent South Korea and guarantee that Syngman Rhee would be bound by the "draft proposal" put forward by the U.S. side this time.

After Dean finished his lengthy defamatory speech, our representative Huang Hua pointed out that Dean's explanation of his authority in his speech just now admitted that his representation of South Korea was conditional. Therefore, he asked Dean to answer: Does the country he represents include South Korea or not? Dean rudely refused our question three times in a row. During his second refusal of our question, Dean threatened our representative in the tone of an ultimatum, asking us to sign the other party's "draft proposal," which had already been refuted and rejected by our side, today, asking us: "Sign or not?" Finally, Dean became furious and insisted that our serious question was an insult to him, and moved for an adjournment until he said "you learn to be more polite." At this point, the U.S. side's intention to deliberately provoke and create an excuse to sabotage the bilateral talks was fully exposed.

Our representative immediately firmly stated that we had rejected the other party's proposal and demanded that Dean continue to conduct serious discussions on the current issues.

Our representative continued to analyze the contradictions in the voting procedures suggested by the other party, and demanded that Dean give a responsible answer to the questions we raised this morning. Because Dean continued to adopt an evasive attitude, our representative pointed out: The reason why Dean cannot answer our questions is because these questions expose that the other party's insistence on "unit voting" is precisely to enable certain member states of the other party to escape the constraints of the agreement, and to reserve room for their perfidious behavior. Our side believes that the issue of voting procedures is an extremely important issue. If the political conference does not have a voting procedure that can guarantee that the participating countries on both sides can abide by the agreement, the equal form and the principle of unanimous agreement of the political conference will be completely destroyed, and the political conference will become a farce. Our representative pointed out that during the Korean armistice negotiations, General Harrison, representing the other party, signed the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," but soon after, the South Korean government, as a member of the other party, forcibly detained 27,000 of our prisoners of war. Therefore, we can never accept this voting procedure of the other party again.

At this point, Dean brazenly acted like a rogue, saying that the "escape" of 27,000 prisoners of war occurred before the armistice agreement took effect, and therefore this matter should not be brought up again. Our side immediately pointed out that regarding the incident of the forced detention of 27,000 prisoners of war, our General Nam Il had already raised a reservation for discussion at the political conference on July 19, and the U.S. side did not object at that time. Now Dean is attempting to unilaterally write off the U.S. side's criminal act of forcibly detaining 27,000 of our prisoners of war after perfidiously signing the "Terms of Reference," which is clearly a further act of perfidy by the U.S. side.

Our representative then pointed out that the other party's request to treat their "draft proposal," which has long been refuted by our side, as a final proposal for us to accept can only make us doubt the other party's sincerity. In order to convene the political conference as soon as possible and resolve the Korean issue as soon as possible, we request the other party to put away their ultimatum and their "draft proposal" as soon as possible, conduct serious discussions on the current issues, and seek reasonable solutions.

Dean, losing control, madly cursed our proposal as "nonsense, a pile of garbage," and once again threatened us to immediately sign the "draft proposal" he put forward, otherwise he would adjourn indefinitely. This fully shows that Dean has made up his mind to use any means to achieve the purpose of sabotaging the bilateral talks. But our side resolutely fought back and insisted on continuing the talks. Dean, having no other tricks to play, again said that the fact that our side raised the fact that South Korea perfidiously forcibly detained our prisoners of war was an insult to the U.S. government, and demanded that our side withdraw it, otherwise he would consider that our side wanted to adjourn the bilateral talks indefinitely.

Our representative immediately pointed out with righteous indignation that the South Korean government's openly violating the "Terms of Reference" signed not long ago and forcibly detaining 27,000 of our prisoners of war is a serious act of perfidy known to the world and that no one can deny. If the other party is determined to adjourn the bilateral talks indefinitely, the other party should bear full responsibility for sabotaging the bilateral talks. As for our side, we are still prepared to continue the talks for the sake of peace, and suggest an adjournment until next Monday. But the U.S. representative, losing his rationality, did not listen to our speech and left the meeting halfway.

    妄图阻挠召开政治会议强迫扣留战俘
    美方故意寻衅中断会谈
    我方严正指出美方应负完全责任
   【新华社开城十二日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国参加关于政治会议问题的双方会谈的代表团发表公报如下：
    在今日举行的双方会谈第二十三次代表会议上，对方代表迪安不顾我方反对，片面宣布无限期休会，并横暴地退出会场。因此，今年十月二十六日在板门店开始的关于政治会议问题的双方会谈现已由于对方的片面宣布无限期休会而陷于中断。
    迪安在今日会议上的态度表明，破坏双方会谈乃是美方蓄意已久的阴谋。美方显然是想利用这种阻挠破坏的无耻手段，来对朝中方面进行毫无用处的恐吓和讹诈，并企图以此使政治会议不得召开，以便他们强迫扣留二万余名尚未听取解释的朝中被俘人员，并保持国际紧张局势。在今日会议开始时，我方代表奇石福先生首先发言，驳斥对方关于表决程序的无理建议。奇石福要求迪安明确答复：既然按照对方建议，政治会议的协议应由双方各作为一个单位来表决达成，而对方成员国则仅在同意某一项协议而参加签字时才受其约束；则纵然对方作为一个单位同意了从朝鲜撤退外国军队，美国政府仍可表示不同意而不受其约束，拒不撤兵；纵然对方同意了和平解决朝鲜问题，南朝鲜政府仍可表示不同意而不受其约束，坚持“北进统一”。如果是这样，对方作为一方和我方达成的协议究竟有什么意义？对方有何保证使这些协议付诸实施？奇石福先生进一步质问，既然迪安是十七个国家的代表，为何他在这里表示可以在他提出的条件下邀请中立国家参加政治会议的时候，他自称代表的南朝鲜政府的外务部长官卞荣泰却根本反对任何中立国参加政治会议？到底是迪安的话算数，还是卞荣泰的话算数，迪安到底是否有权代表南朝鲜在此谈判？
    显然由于理屈词穷，迪安对于这些具有极大重要性的问题竟称之为“犯不着打的草靶子”而完全避不作答。相反的，他倒以两个半小时的时间，在战俘问题上对我方肆意进行造谣污蔑，并侈谈对方反对确定议程和由联合国提供秘书处的荒谬建议。
    同时，迪安为了逃避我方所提他是否代表南朝鲜的尖锐问题，竟悍然宣称，如果我方同意苏联作为交战一方参加政治会议的荒谬主张，那么他就可以代表南朝鲜，保证李承晚受美方此次所提“建议草案”的约束。
    在迪安结束其长篇诽谤性的发言以后，我方代表黄华指出，迪安在刚才发言中关于其权限的说明承认了他之代表南朝鲜是有条件的，因此要求迪安回答：他所代表的国家到底是否包括南朝鲜在内？迪安连续三次粗鲁地拒绝了我方的问题。在第二次拒绝我方质问时，迪安竟以最后通牒口吻威胁我方代表在今日就同他在早经我方驳倒并予以拒绝的对方“建议草案”上签字，问我：“签还是不签？”最后，迪安竟老羞成怒，硬说我方的严肃质问是对他的污辱，动议休会，直到他所谓“你们学会更有礼貌时为止”。至此美方故意寻衅，制造藉口破坏双方会谈的意图已暴露无遗。
    我方代表当即坚决表示我已拒绝对方建议，要求迪安继续对当前的各项问题进行认真的讨论。
    我方代表继续分析对方所建议的表决程序中的各点矛盾，并要求迪安对我方今早提出的问题作出负责的答复。由于迪安继续采取逃避回答的态度，我方代表指出：迪安所以不能回答我方的问题是因为这些问题暴露了对方坚持“单位投票”的目的就是要使对方某些成员国能逃避协议的约束，为他们背信弃义的行为预留地步。我方认为表决程序问题是一个极为重要的问题，如果政治会议没有一个可以保证双方参加各国能遵守协议的表决程序，政治会议的双方对等形式和一致协议的原则就将被破坏无遗，政治会议就将成为一幕滑稽戏。我方代表指出，在朝鲜停战谈判中，代表对方的哈利逊将军在 “中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”上签字以后不久，作为对方之一员的南朝鲜政府就强迫扣留了我方二万七千名被俘人员。因此我方决不能再接受对方这种表决程序。
    至此，迪安竟大耍无赖，说二万七千名战俘之 “逃亡”，发生于停战协定生效之前，因而此事不应重提。我方当即指出，对于二万七千名战俘被强迫扣留事件，我方南日大将已于七月十九日提出保留在政治会议上讨论，美方当时并未反对。现在迪安竟企图片面将美方背信弃义在“职权范围”已经签字后强迫扣留二万七千名我方被俘人员的罪恶行为一笔勾销，这显然是美方进一步背信弃义的行为。
    我方代表继又指出，对方要求把他们那种早已为我方所驳倒的“建议草案”当作最后建议要我方接受，只能使我方怀疑对方的诚意。为了政治会议早日召开，朝鲜问题早日解决，我方要求对方趁早把他们的最后通牒，他们的“建议草案”收起来，对当前各项问题进行认真讨论，寻求合理解决。
    迪安失去了自制似的狂骂我方建议为“一派胡言，一堆垃圾”，并再一次威胁我方立即在他提出的“建议草案”上签字，要不然就无限期休会。这充分表明迪安已下定决心不惜以任何手段来达到破坏双方会谈的目的。但我方坚决予以回击，并坚持继续会谈。迪安无技可施，竟又以我方提出南朝鲜背信弃义强迫扣留我方被俘人员的事实是对美国政府的污辱，要求我方撤回，否则他就将认为是我方要把双方会谈无限期休会。
    我方代表当即义正词严地指出：南朝鲜政府公然破坏签字不久的“职权范围”，强迫扣留我方二万七千名被俘人员是举世皆知、谁都不能否认的严重的背信弃义行为。对方如果决心使双方会谈无限期休会，对方应负破坏双方会谈的完全责任。至于我方，为了和平仍然准备继续会谈，并建议休会至下星期一。但美方代表竟失去理性，不听我方发言，中途退出会场。
