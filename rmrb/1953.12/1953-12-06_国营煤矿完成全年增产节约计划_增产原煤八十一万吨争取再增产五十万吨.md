National state-owned coal mines comprehensively fulfilled the annual production increase and savings plan ahead of schedule on November 24th.

Since the launch of the production increase and savings campaign in September, national state-owned coal mines have, by November 24th, not only fulfilled the state coal production plan for January to November 24th, but have also fully completed the originally planned increase of 810,000 tons of raw coal. It is estimated that another 500,000 tons can be produced by the end of the year. In terms of savings, the serious situation of massive cost overruns has been reversed, and a surplus has been achieved every month since September. From January to October, 143 billion yuan in profits had been turned over to the state, completing 130% of the annual savings plan.

The reason why the national state-owned coal mines' production increase and savings campaign has achieved the above results is mainly due to the strengthening and improvement of the following tasks: First, strengthening the leadership over production. During the production increase and savings campaign, leading cadres at all levels of the coal mine system summarized the work of the first half of the year; went deep into the grassroots, grasped the key points, and identified weak links; and adopted methods such as leaders calculating the big picture and mobilizing the masses to calculate the details, guiding the workers to launch competitions. For example, after carefully calculating the details and grasping the key points, the Hegang Mining Bureau discovered that tunneling was lagging behind coal mining. They immediately focused on tunneling work and established a special responsibility system for leading tunneling work at the bureau, mine, and pit levels, completing the annual tunneling plan two months and ten days ahead of schedule. After summarizing its work, the Fushun Longfeng Mine found that production management cadres spent too much time in meetings and did not have time to go deep into leading production. Therefore, it was decided to reduce meetings and spend more time at the production site, specifically assigning responsibilities for the main coal mining faces, implementing a mine director duty system, and strengthening leadership at the pit entrance. Since September, the mine has evenly completed its work plan every month. Second, vigorously promoting advanced experiences and launching a rationalization proposal campaign. At the beginning of the campaign, each bureau and mine summarized the work of promoting advanced experiences in the first half of the year and identified the main crux of the inadequate promotion of advanced experiences, which was the lack of responsible persons and specific leadership. Therefore, each bureau and mine established a special responsibility system for promoting advanced experiences. During the campaign, various tips and rationalization proposals emerged continuously. Employees of the Fushun Mining Bureau's open-pit mine submitted 3,127 rationalization proposals in one and a half months. By the first half of November, employees of state-owned coal mines in North China had submitted 1,900 rationalization proposals. After these bureaus and mines adopted the rationalization proposals, the production management work was greatly improved. At present, many mines have launched a wave of learning and promoting advanced experiences and are vigorously promoting the quick tunneling experience of Ma Liu Hai and Cui Guoshan, the safe production experience of Shi Yuhai, and the mechanization experience of Lv Wenping in Hegang. Third, promoting mass production meetings, promptly solving many specific and important problems in production, and promoting the in-depth development of the campaign. Practice has proven that mass production meetings are the most effective way to combine leadership with workers and coordinate work types, and they have been welcomed by the majority of employees. The Datong Mining Bureau regularly holds group production meetings, with 60% to 80% of workers automatically participating, solving many important problems in production. Fourth, mobilizing staff in departments to participate in competitions and strengthening the political work of departments. For example, staff in departments of various coal mines in North China launched a four-competition campaign (competing in going deep into workshops, competing in solving problems in a timely manner, competing in accurate digital plans, and competing in improving work methods), which greatly promoted the development of the campaign. Staff in departments of various coal mines in Northeast China have formulated their own plans. For example, 80% of the technicians in the Machinery and Electrical Department of the Jixi Mining Bureau went deep into the pit, solving the problem of frequent accidents in the Didao Mine's No. 8 electric slide. After the Party Committee of the Fushun Open-pit Mine held several symposiums for technical personnel, the technical personnel went deep into the grassroots. For example, technical personnel from the Technical Office went deep into the deep pit and helped the workers solve the problem of using self-tipping vehicles instead of shale vehicles, which increased the shale tipping efficiency by 70% and completely solved the problem of insufficient shale supply affecting filling.

Currently, the national state-owned coal mines' production increase and savings campaign has taken a further step on the existing basis. In addition to fully completing the plan in conjunction with the current central work, they are also actively preparing for the production and capital construction in 1954 and launching a mass competition campaign.

### 国营煤矿完成全年增产节约计划  增产原煤八十一万吨争取再增产五十万吨

    国营煤矿完成全年增产节约计划
    增产原煤八十一万吨争取再增产五十万吨
    全国国营煤矿提前在十一月二十四日全面完成全年增产节约计划。
    全国国营煤矿从九月份开展增产节约运动，到十一月二十四日止，除了完成一月到十一月二十四日的国家产煤计划外，已全部完成原订增产原煤八十一万吨的计划，估计到年底还可以再增产五十万吨。在节约方面，不仅扭转了成本大量超支的严重情况，而且从九月份以来，月月都有盈余；一月到十月份已上缴利润一千四百三十亿元，完成了全年节约计划百分之一百三十。
    全国国营煤矿的增产节约运动所以能取得上述成绩，主要是加强和改进了下列几项工作：第一，加强了对生产的领导。在增产节约运动中，煤矿系统各级领导干部总结了上半年工作；深入基层，抓关键，找薄弱环节；采取领导方面算大账、发动群众算细账等方法，引导职工群众展开竞赛。如鹤岗矿务局经过算细账、抓关键，发现掘进落后于采煤的情况后，立即抓住掘进工作，并在局、矿、坑建立了掘进工作领导的专责制，便提前两个月零十一天完成了全年掘进计划，抚顺龙凤矿经过总结工作，发现生产管理干部开会多，没有时间深入领导生产，因此决定少开会，多到生产现场，并具体分工掌握主要采煤大掌子，实行矿长值班制，加强了坑口的领导。从九月份起，该矿月月均衡完成了作业计划。第二，大力推广先进经验，开展合理化建议运动。各局、矿在开展运动初期，总结了上半年推广先进经验的工作，找出了推广先进经验工作作得不够的主要症结，是无人负责和缺乏具体领导。因此各局矿便建立了推广先进经验的专责制。在运动中，各种窍门和合理化建议不断涌现。抚顺矿务局露天矿职工，在一个半月内提出了三千一百二十七件合理化建议。华北区各国营煤矿职工到十一月上半月止，提出了一千九百件合理化建议。这些局、矿采纳了合理化建议后，使生产管理工作大大提高了一步。目前许多矿已掀起了学习与推广先进经验的热潮，正大力推广马六孩、崔国山快速掘进经验，施玉海安全生产经验，鹤岗吕文平机械化经验等。第三，推行了群众性的生产会议，及时解决生产中的许多具体而重要的问题，推动了运动的深入发展。实践证明，群众性的生产会议是使领导与工人结合、工种与工种配合的最有效的办法，受到了广大职工的欢迎。大同矿务局定期召开小组生产会议，有百分之六十到八十的工人自动参加，解决了生产中许多重要问题。第四，发动了科室人员参加竞赛，并加强了科室的政治工作。如华北区各煤矿科室人员展开四比运动（比深入车间、比及时解决问题、比数字计划精确、比改进工作方法），大大地推动了运动的开展。东北区各煤矿科室人员都制订了自己的计划。如鸡西矿务局机电处有百分之八十的技术人员都深入坑内，解决了滴道矿八井电溜子经常出事故的问题。抚顺露天矿经党委召开了几次技术人员座谈会后，技术人员都深入了基层。如技术室技术人员深入深部坑，帮助工人解决了利用自翻车代替页岩车的问题，使页岩翻卸效率提高了百分之七十，彻底解决了页岩供应不足影响充填的问题。
    目前，全国国营煤矿增产节约运动在现有的基础上又深入了一步。除了结合当前中心工作全面完成计划外，更积极为作好一九五四年的生产与基本建设的准备工作，开展了群众性的竞赛运动。
