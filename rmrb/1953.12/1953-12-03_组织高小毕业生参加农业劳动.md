Organizing senior primary school graduates to participate in agricultural labor

Actively promoting the socialist transformation of agriculture and vigorously developing agricultural production are important aspects of the general line for the transition period in our country, and the only correct path for all working farmers to achieve prosperity. In this great transformation endeavor, China's agriculture will break away from its historical backwardness and gradually transform into advanced socialist agriculture. To achieve this goal, we need to do a lot of work, and an important part of it is to replace old technologies and old management methods with new technologies and new management methods, which requires culture. Many collective farms in the Soviet Union have their own agronomists and agricultural technicians, which is the reason why. Although China's agriculture is still far from the level of the Soviet Union, the issue of culture has already been raised in areas where agricultural producers' cooperatives are developing well. Therefore, organizing rural senior primary school graduates to participate in agricultural production and play an active role in the socialist transformation of agriculture is an important task.

It is understandable that many rural senior primary school graduates want to continue their studies, and their parents also want them to continue their studies. This reflects the improvement of the people's material living standards and the increasing cultural demands. The People's Government is also striving to appropriately meet the people's demands. This can not only be proved by the rapid development of education in recent years, but also by the many important measures taken by various regions this summer to solve the problem of senior primary school graduates' further education as much as possible. However, due to the limitations of China's economic development level and the fact that China must first concentrate its efforts on developing heavy industry, it is not possible to use more manpower, material resources, and financial resources to develop junior high schools. Therefore, these demands cannot be fully met at present. Thus, guiding rural senior primary school graduates to participate in agricultural production is the basic way to solve their employment problem.

The article published in today's newspaper about Chaoshui Township in Penglai County, Shandong Province, on organizing senior primary school graduates to participate in agricultural production (see page 3) tells us that as long as patient persuasion and education are carried out, rural senior primary school graduates can actively participate in agricultural production and can become an important force in promoting the great cause of socialist transformation of agriculture. At the same time, senior primary school graduates can continuously enrich their production knowledge in the production process, become production experts, and become activists in various fields, doing many important things for the country. Their future is also infinitely broad. The experience of Chaoshui Township can persuade general senior primary school graduates and their parents to change their ideas of belittling agricultural production, thinking that participating in agricultural production is unpromising and has no future, and more effectively solve the problem of rural senior primary school graduates' employment, and cultivate a group of activists with a certain cultural level on the agricultural production front.

The experience of Chaoshui Township shows that because senior primary school graduates have the level of basic education and a certain political awareness, and because they are young, progressive in thinking, active in learning, and willing to accept new things, they can play an active role in the great cause of socialist transformation of agriculture after participating in agricultural production. They can take the lead and persuade their parents to participate in the mutual aid and cooperation movement; they can persuade their parents and encourage everyone to use new farm tools and new farming methods for production, and help the Party and the People's Government overcome the conservative ideas existing in some farmers. In these aspects, the senior primary school graduates who participated in agricultural production in Chaoshui Township have already made many achievements, and it is believed that as long as they continue to work hard, they will definitely make more achievements. This will undoubtedly play a great role in the great cause of gradually uniting the working farmers and carrying out large-scale agricultural production with new farm tools and farming methods. Some comrades once mistakenly believed that rural senior primary school graduates are too young, cannot and do not need to participate in agricultural production, and even if they do participate in agricultural production, they will only waste time in vain and will not have any effect. These comrades did not see that rural senior primary school graduates not only are generally older and can participate in agricultural production, but also because they have received basic education, they can play a role that some farmers cannot play, and the agricultural production front urgently needs such new forces. The facts in Chaoshui Township are proof.

The senior primary school graduates who have already participated in agricultural production have eloquently proved with their courage, wisdom, and creative labor that senior primary school graduates who participate in agricultural production have infinitely broad prospects. Relying on their original cultural foundation, in the process of labor and in the process of spare-time self-study, they constantly absorb scientific agricultural production knowledge and other aspects of knowledge, and constantly absorb the production experience of old farmers, which has not only enabled them to effectively improve agricultural production, but also improved their cultural level. Like Xu Tingchun, an 18-year-old senior primary school graduate from Houlu Village, Guoxi District, Yexian County, Shandong Province, has become a well-known labor model in the province and has been honorably elected as an alternate member of the Shandong Provincial Working Committee of the Communist Youth League. Many of the senior primary school graduates who participated in agricultural production in Chaoshui Township have been trained to become production experts, and some female students have become models for women's production in the whole village, and some have been elected as district cadres and people's representatives. Therefore, they have been respected and praised by the broad masses of working farmers. In addition, in Haiya Township, Rongcheng County, Shandong Province, the senior primary school graduates who participated in agricultural production are enthusiastically engaged in spare-time political, agricultural production technology, and cultural learning, and constantly improving their cultural level. These achievements are, of course, only preliminary for them. They are very young, and they have participated in agricultural production for a short time. As long as they continue to work hard, it is believed that with the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement and the development of rural cultural work, their production experience and production organization experience will definitely become richer, their cultural level will definitely be improved, and they will gradually become experts with rich experience and mastery of agricultural cooperation. Therefore, they have the potential to create greater achievements for our country. Needless to say, their career is the most promising, and their future is infinitely bright. Some people cannot see this future because they are influenced by the exploiting classes and despise physical labor. As long as we think of the countless Stakhanovite workers in the Soviet Union, the countless advanced collective farm members, and the countless industrial and agricultural labor models in our country, and think of their outstanding talents and their outstanding contributions to the people, we will not fail to understand this issue and we cannot but infinitely love physical labor.

The main part of the senior primary school graduates is in the countryside. Therefore, correctly solving the employment problem of rural senior primary school graduates and organizing them to participate in agricultural labor is an important task of the Party and the People's Government, and also an urgent requirement of the broad masses of working farmers. Now, Chaoshui Township in Penglai County, Shandong Province, has provided several important and practical methods for solving this problem, and other places also have such experience. We should summarize these experiences and promote these experiences, and use vivid examples to educate the senior primary school graduates who are currently unwilling to participate in agricultural production and the parents who prevent them from participating in agricultural production, and educate all farmers who support this idea and therefore often create this social opinion. This education should be linked with vigorously publicizing the state's general line for the transition period, publicizing socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture and the relationship between them, and publicizing the glory of engaging in the great cause of agricultural cooperation, so as to form a social opinion that actively supports rural senior primary school graduates to participate in agricultural production and promote more senior primary school graduates to invest in agricultural production. In the long run, to completely solve this problem, it is also necessary to educate primary school teachers so that they understand that the old schools make people despise physical labor and deepen the contradiction between physical labor and mental labor; the new education makes people respect and love physical labor so as to gradually eliminate the antagonism between physical labor and mental labor and further eliminate the essential differences between them with the development of society. Our primary school teachers must use the new social idea of labor glory to educate students and cultivate students' precious quality of loving labor so that students can actively participate in production after leaving school and become model figures with scientific knowledge on the production front.

Implementing the socialist transformation of agriculture and developing agricultural production are one of the main contents of the general line and general task of our country during the transition period. After the socialist society is built in our country, agriculture will still be an important part of the entire national economy. Therefore, senior primary school graduates who participate in agricultural production should establish the idea of engaging in agricultural production for a long time, work hard, immerse themselves in research, and train themselves to become experts in mastering cooperative agriculture. The Party organizations and the Communist Youth League organizations in rural areas should strengthen their ideological education, and adopt various methods to organize them to engage in spare-time cultural learning, constantly improve their level of consciousness and working ability, and constantly improve their cultural level so that they can become important assistants in rural work and organize more senior primary school graduates to participate in agricultural production and promote the greater development of agricultural cooperation.

### 组织高小毕业生参加农业劳动

    组织高小毕业生参加农业劳动
    实行农业的社会主义改造，积极发展农业生产，是我国过渡时期总路线的一个重要方面，也是全体劳动农民走向富裕的唯一正确道路。在这一伟大的改造事业中，我国的农业将摆脱历史上的落后状态，逐步地变为先进的社会主义的农业。要达到这一目标，需要我们作很多工作，其中的重要一项，就是用新的技术和新的经营管理方法，代替旧的技术和旧的经营管理方法，这就需要文化。苏联的许多集体农庄，都有自己的农学家和农业技术人员，就是这个道理。我国的农业虽然距离苏联的水平还很远，但是在农业生产合作社发展得好的地区，已经提出了文化的问题。所以组织农村高小毕业生参加农业生产，在农业的社会主义改造事业中发挥积极作用，乃是一项重要任务。
    农村许多高小毕业生要求升学，他们的家长也要求他们升学，这是容易理解的，这反映了人民物质生活水平的提高和文化要求的日益高涨，人民政府也在努力适当满足人民的这种要求，这不仅可以从几年来教育事业的迅速发展得到证明，而且可以从今年暑期各地为了尽可能地解决高小毕业生的升学问题所采取的许多重要措施得到证明；但是由于我国经济发展水平的限制，由于我国目前必须首先集中力量发展重工业，还不能用更多的人力物力财力发展初级中学，所以，这种要求在目前还不可能完全满足。因此，引导农村高小毕业生参加农业生产，乃是解决他们的出路问题的基本办法。
    今天本报发表的山东蓬莱县潮水乡关于组织高小毕业生参加农业生产的文章（见第三版）告诉我们，只要进行耐心的说服教育，农村高小毕业生是能够积极参加农业生产，并且可以成为推动农业的社会主义改造这一伟大事业的重要力量的；同时，高小毕业生在生产过程中可以不断丰富自己的生产知识，成为生产能手，并且可以成为各方面的积极分子，给国家作许多重要的事情，他们的前途同样是无限广阔的。潮水乡的这些经验，可以说服一般高小毕业生和他们的家长，使他们改变轻视农业生产、认为参加农业生产没有出息、没有前途的思想，更有效地解决农村高小毕业生的出路问题，培养一批农业生产战线上的具有一定文化水平的积极分子。
    潮水乡的经验说明，由于高小毕业生具有基础教育的水平，具有一定的政治觉悟，由于他们年纪轻，思想进步，学习积极，勇于接受新鲜事物，所以他们在参加农业生产之后，就能够在农业的社会主义改造的伟大事业中发挥积极作用。他们可以自己带头并说服自己的家长参加互助合作运动；他们可以说服自己的家长并鼓动大家使用新的农具和运用新的耕作方法进行生产，帮助党和人民政府克服存在于一部分农民中的保守思想。在这些方面，潮水乡参加农业生产的高小毕业生，已经作出了不少成绩，相信他们只要继续努力，一定会作出更多的成绩。这对于逐步地把劳动农民联合起来，用新的农具和耕作方法进行大规模的农业生产这一伟大事业，无疑地会发生很大作用的。有些同志曾经错误地认为，农村高小毕业生因为年龄太小，不能也不需要他们参加农业生产，即令参加农业生产，也只能白白地浪费时间，不会发生什么作用。这些同志没有看到，农村高小毕业生不仅因为一般年龄较大，可以参加农业生产，而且因为他们已经受过基础教育，可以发挥一部分农民所不能发挥的作用，农业生产战线上是十分需要这样的新生力量的。潮水乡的事实就是明证。
    已经参加农业生产的高小毕业生，以他们的勇敢、智慧和创造性的劳动，雄辩地证明了：参加农业生产的高小毕业生，有着无限广阔的前途。他们倚靠原有的文化基础，在劳动过程中，在业余自学过程中，不断吸收科学的农业生产知识以及其他方面的知识，不断吸收老农的生产经验，这不仅已经使他们成效卓著地改进了农业生产，而且提高了文化水平。像山东掖县过西区后吕村年仅十八岁的高小毕业生徐廷春，已经成为全省知名的劳动模范，光荣地被选为青年团山东省工作委员会的候补委员。潮水乡参加农业生产的高小毕业生，许多人已经锻炼成为生产能手，有的女生则成为全村妇女生产的榜样，有的则被选为区干部和人民代表。因此他们受到了广大劳动农民的尊重和赞扬。另外，在山东省荣成县海崖乡，参加农业生产的高小毕业生，则热情地从事着业余的政治、农业生产技术和文化学习，不断提高着自己的文化水平。这些成绩，对于他们来说，当然只是初步的。他们很年轻，他们参加农业生产的时间还很短，只要他们继续努力，相信随着互助合作运动的发展，随着农村文化工作的开展，他们的生产经验和组织生产的经验一定会更加丰富，他们的文化水平一定会更加提高，他们会逐渐成为具有丰富经验、掌握农业合作化事业的能手，因此，他们就有可能为我们的国家创造更大的成绩。用不着说，他们的事业是最有出息的一种事业，他们的前途是无限远大的。有些人看不清这种前途，这是因为他们受了剥削阶级的影响，轻视体力劳动。我们只要想一想苏联无数的斯大哈诺夫工作者，无数的先进的集体农庄庄员，我国无数的工业和农业劳动模范，想一想他们所表现的卓越才能和对人民的卓越贡献，我们就不会不了解这个问题，就不能不无限地热爱体力劳动。
    高小毕业生的主要部分在农村，因此，正确地解决农村高小毕业生的出路问题，组织他们参加农业劳动，是党和人民政府的重要任务，也是广大劳动农民的迫切要求。现在，山东蓬莱县潮水乡已经给解决这个问题提供了若干重要的切实可行的办法，另外一些地方也有这样的经验。我们应该总结这些经验，推广这些经验，用生动的事例，向目前还不愿意参加农业生产的高小毕业生和阻挠他们参加农业生产的家长进行教育，向支持这种思想因而往往制造这种社会舆论的所有农民进行教育。这种教育应该和大张旗鼓地宣传过渡时期的国家总路线联系起来，宣传社会主义工业化和农业的社会主义改造以及它们之间的关系，宣传从事农业合作化这一伟大事业的光荣，以便形成积极支持农村高小毕业生参加农业生产的社会舆论，推动更多的高小毕业生投入农业生产。从长远处看，要彻底解决这一问题，还必须教育小学教师，让他们懂得：旧的学校使人轻视体力劳动，加深着体力劳动和智力劳动之间的矛盾；新的教育则使人尊重和热爱体力劳动，以便随着社会的发展，逐步地消灭体力劳动和智力劳动之间的对立性，并进而消灭它们之间的本质差别。我们的小学教师必须用劳动光荣这一新的社会思想去教育学生，培养学生热爱劳动的宝贵品质，以便学生在离开学校以后能够积极参加生产，成为生产战线上具有科学知识的模范人物。
    实行农业的社会主义改造，发展农业生产，是我国过渡时期总路线总任务的主要内容之一；在我国社会主义社会建成以后，农业仍然是整个国民经济的重要组成部分。因此，参加农业生产的高小毕业生应该树立长期从事农业生产的思想，辛勤劳动，埋头钻研，把自己锻炼成为掌握合作化农业的能手。农村中的党组织和青年团组织则应该加强对他们的思想教育，并采用各种方式，组织他们从事业余的文化学习，不断提高他们的觉悟程度和工作能力，不断提高他们的文化水平，使他们成为农村工作中的重要助手，并组织更多的高小毕业生参加农业生产，促进农业合作化事业的更大发展。
