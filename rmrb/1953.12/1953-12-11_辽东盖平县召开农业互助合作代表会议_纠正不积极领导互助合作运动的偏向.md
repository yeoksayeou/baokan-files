Liaodong Gaiping County Convenes Agricultural Mutual Aid and Cooperation Representative Meeting
Correct the Deviation of Not Actively Leading the Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement

Liaodong Province's Gaiping County convened a county-wide agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation representative meeting on November 8th. At the meeting, Gaiping County Magistrate Zhang Ming delivered a report on the general line and general task of the state during the transition period, enabling all representatives to further clarify the direction of rural economic development. In the discussions, they summarized and reviewed the achievements of the county's mutual aid and cooperation movement over the past year and the main problems currently existing.

On the basis of party rectification and study last winter, the county organized cadres this spring to study the CCP Central Committee's "Resolution on Agricultural Production Mutual Aid and Cooperation" and other three documents, and conscientiously implemented the spirit of the Northeast Bureau's Rural Work Conference. The county's mutual aid and cooperation movement has made new progress. According to statistics in September this year, organized farmers accounted for 46.6 percent of the county's farm households, an increase of 14 percent compared with 1952, including one collective farm, 27 agricultural production cooperatives, 1,213 permanent teams, 3,634 seasonal teams, and 2,175 exchange labor teams. In production, these mutual aid and cooperation organizations have demonstrated the superiority of being organized. However, because some district and village leading cadres did not fully understand the spirit of "proceeding from the current situation of small-scale peasant economy" put forward in the CCP Central Committee's instructions, they did not dare to boldly educate the masses on mutual aid and cooperation, and turned "active leadership" into "laissez-faire," relaxing their leadership over mutual aid and cooperation. As a result, many problems existing in mutual aid teams were not resolved in a timely manner, and many farmers who were wealthy themselves and unwilling to organize (and some village cadres) took phrases out of context and promoted individual farming everywhere, saying that "allowing individual farming" was "advocating individual farming," which affected farmers' enthusiasm for organizing. Qipanling Village had six permanent teams in the spring, one of which has now disbanded, and two team leaders have given up leadership. Two of the six seasonal teams disbanded as early as the summer hoeing season, and the number of households organized decreased by 16 percent compared with the spring, forming a phenomenon of "booming in the spring, slackening in the summer, and self-destructing in the autumn." In Xianghuangqi Village, the Second District, there were problems in the mutual aid teams. The mutual aid team leader saw that the village cadres did not lead, and the district cadres did not mention mutual aid and cooperation when they came, so he waited until autumn to talk about it again. The crops were not cultivated well, and weeds grew everywhere. During summer hoeing, there was a lot of rain, and weeds grew everywhere, making it difficult for many mutual aid teams to take turns working, and the leadership did not promptly lead the research into reasonable solutions. In addition, the issues of livestock use and profit-sharing for fruit trees entering the cooperative have not been resolved for a long time, which has also affected the consolidation of mutual aid teams.

At the meeting, many district and village cadres and representatives of mutual aid and cooperation reviewed their past mistakes of relaxing leadership, further recognized the policy of "actively leading and steadily advancing," and expressed their determination to resolutely lead farmers to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation, and lead farmers to build a prosperous countryside for everyone. The meeting also studied the practices and steps of consolidating and developing mutual aid and cooperation organizations in combination with winter production.

    辽东盖平县召开农业互助合作代表会议
    纠正不积极领导互助合作运动的偏向
    辽东省盖平县在十一月八日召开全县农业生产互助合作代表会议，会上，盖平县县长章明作了国家过渡时期的总路线总任务的报告，使全体代表进一步明确认识了农村经济的发展方向，并在讨论中总结和检查了全县一年来互助合作运动的成就和当前存在的主要问题。
    该县在去冬整党学习的基础上，今春又组织干部学习了中共中央关于农业生产互助合作的决议等三个文件，并切实贯彻了东北局农村工作会议的精神，全县互助合作运动又有新的发展。据今年九月的统计，组织起来的农民占全县农户的百分之四十六点六，比一九五二年增加了百分之十四，计有集体农庄一处、农业生产合作社二十七个、常年组一千二百一十三个、三大季组三千六百三十四个、换工插犋组二千一百七十五个。在生产中，这些互助合作组织都显示了组织起来的优越性。但是，由于部分区村领导干部没有全面地领会中共中央指示中所提出的“从小农经济现状出发”的精神，不敢对群众大胆地进行互助合作的教育，把“积极领导”变成“放任自流”，放松了对互助合作的领导，致使许多互助组存在的问题得不到及时解决，许多本身富裕、不愿组织起来的农民（并有一部分村干部）断章取义地到处宣传单干，把“允许单干”说成“提倡单干”，影响了农民组织起来的积极性。七盘岭村春起有六个常年组，现已散伙一个，组长放弃领导的两个；六个三大季组有两个组从夏锄时就散了伙，组织起来的户数比春天减少百分之十六，形成“春天轰轰烈烈、夏天松松懈懈、秋天自消自灭”的现象。第二区厢黄旗村互助组中有问题，互助组长看村干部不领导，区干部来了也不提互助合作的事，就等待秋后再说，庄稼作务得不好，草苗齐长。夏锄中雨多，草苗齐长，许多互助组轮流作业发生困难，领导方面也没有及时领导研究合理的解决办法。另外，牲畜使用、果树入社分红问题都长期没有解决，也影响互助组不能巩固。
    在会上，有不少区村干部和互助合作代表，检讨了过去放松领导的错误，进一步认识了“积极领导稳步前进”的方针，纷纷表示一定要坚决领导农民走互助合作的道路，领导农民建设大家富裕的农村。会上并研究了结合冬季生产整顿和发展互助合作组织的做法和步骤。
