    Emphasize Winter Management of Rapeseed Fields
    With the development of national economic construction and the continuous improvement of people's lives, the demand for edible oil is increasing day by day. Increasing oil production has become one of the important tasks in current agricultural production.
    Rapeseed is a major oil crop in the South. The planting area in some regions has increased this year compared to 1952, but there are still some rapeseed producing areas where farmers have never attached importance to rapeseed production. They consider rapeseed a "by-product" and a "lazy crop," believing that increased or decreased production doesn't matter, and therefore do not pay attention to fertilizer application. This view is wrong. Rapeseed is a very important oil crop, and with careful cultivation, the yield can be very high, resulting in significant economic benefits.
    To increase the yield of rapeseed, in addition to paying attention to deep plowing, applying base fertilizer, and ensuring full seedling emergence during sowing, the most important measures at present are applying additional fertilizer and doing a good job of inter-tillage and drainage. Last year, Yu Shufang, a farmer in Hudong County, Anhui Province, deep ploughed, finely harrowed, applied plenty of base fertilizer, and planted at an appropriate density when sowing rapeseed. He also top-dressed with quick-acting fertilizer once in winter, dug deep drainage ditches, hoed weeds three times in winter, and once in spring. His rapeseed yielded 210 jin per mu, more than double the local yield. The main experiences of veteran farmers Peng Tiankuan and Zhang Xueyi in Jiange County, Sichuan, who harvested 220 jin of rapeseed per mu last year, were also applying additional fertilizer and doing a good job of inter-tillage and drainage.
    The leading departments in rapeseed planting areas should attach importance to the work of increasing the yield of this crop, learn from the experience of increasing the yield of this crop, actively lead the masses to fertilize and manage rapeseed fields, and increase rapeseed yield.

    重视油菜田的冬季管理工作
    随着国家经济建设的开展和人民生活不断提高，食油的需用量日渐增加，增产油料已成为当前农业生产中的重要任务之一。
    油菜是南方的一种主要油料作物，今年有些地区的播种面积比一九五二年已有增加，但还有些油菜产区的农民，一向不重视油菜生产，认为油菜是“副产物”“懒庄稼”，增不增产不要紧，因而不注意加工施肥。这种看法是错误的，油菜是一种很重要的油料作物，而且经过加工培植，产量很高，经济收益很大。
    提高油菜籽的产量，除播种时应注意深耕，施基肥和保证全苗外，当前最重要的措施是加施肥料和做好中耕、排水等工作。安徽省湖东县农民余术芳去年所种植的油菜，在播种时做到深耕细耙、多施基肥和适当密植，在冬季追施速效肥料一次，还挖了较深的排水沟，此外又在冬季锄草三次，春季锄草一次，他的油菜每亩收了菜籽二百一十斤，超过当地产量一倍多。四川剑阁县老农彭天宽、张学义去年种的油菜每亩收二百二十斤的主要经验，也是加施追肥和做好中耕排水。
    种植油菜地区的领导部门，应该重视这种作物的增产工作，学习种植这种作物的增产经验，积极领导群众对油菜田进行施肥管理，提高油菜产量。
