State-Owned Coal Mines in North China Complete Tunneling Plan Ahead of Schedule
State-Owned Coal Mines in Central-South China Improve Tunneling Work and Increase Production

	State-owned coal mines in North China completed the annual tunneling footage plan 37 days ahead of schedule, exceeding the quota by 0.23 percent. Tunneling workers in various mines have prepared enough coal for more than four months of mining in 1954, creating favorable conditions for spring production and increased coal production. This guarantees a steady supply of coal from state-owned coal mines in North China to more than 300 industrial, mining, transportation, and enterprises, as well as the people of 18 provinces and cities next year.
	In order to strengthen tunneling work, the North China Coal Mine Administration held several meetings to correct the thinking of some cadres who only focused on crash production increases and neglected tunneling. They also studied and improved tunneling work. In the fourth quarter of 1952, some mines in North China neglected tunneling work in order to rush to complete production increase tasks, even stopping tunneling work altogether, resulting in no coal mining faces in the first quarter of this year. For example, the Jingsi Fangshan Mine had to reduce mining and concentrate on strengthening tunneling work in the first quarter of this year due to the lack of coal mining faces. As a result, production decreased by half, and it was not until the beginning of the third quarter that the mine regained its original production capacity. While strengthening tunneling work, various mines have fixed tunneling teams, increased the number of tunneling workers, and strengthened technical guidance for tunneling work. For example, Datong, Kailuan and other mines hold weekly tunneling production meetings to exchange experiences and solve problems. The mines also actively improved the conditions for tunneling work. At Kailuan Coal Mine, which originally had a low degree of mechanization and backward working methods, the number of tunneling teams using electric drills and multi-hole cycle operations now accounts for about 45 percent of the total, doubling the number at the beginning of this year. Tunneling workers in various mines have shown a high degree of enthusiasm in order to complete and over fulfill the state plan. Many tunneling teams have actively promoted advanced experiences such as hollow blasting, deep-hole operations, finished turnouts, finished sheds, parallel cracking methods, and cycle operations based on specific conditions. Tunneling workers at the Jingsi Fangshan Mine improved the parallel cracking method and created a unique method of drawing slots with one eye, which not only improved tunneling efficiency but also greatly reduced the consumption of gunpowder and detonators. Lian Wanlu, a tunneling worker at the Datong Coal Mine, studied the method of advancing with artillery four times, solving the problems of water hazards and misfires during blasting. After the launch of the Increase Production and Practice Economy campaign, the nationally famous Ma Liuhai and Lian Wanlu teams first launched a challenge competition to tunneling workers across the country with a monthly progress of 750 meters. In October, they reached 766 meters and 70 centimeters per month, over fulfilling the competition plan. In North China, 13 tunneling teams and squads including the Yangquan Li Shenghe team and the Kailuan Yang Chengrui team responded to the Ma Liuhai and Lian Wanlu teams' challenge competition. More than 80 percent of the tunneling teams in the region have launched labor competitions. Currently, the mines are continuing their efforts to prepare more than enough coal and qualified coal mining faces for next year.

	Since the in-depth development of the Increase Production and Practice Economy campaign, the state-owned coal mine system in Central-South China has shown many new atmospheres. The state-owned coal mine system in Central-South China originally planned to increase production by 20,000 tons of raw coal and save 17.5 billion yuan, striving to reach 19 billion yuan. After this plan was deployed to the mining bureaus, the mining bureaus greatly exceeded the original plan after mobilizing the masses to make careful calculations. Since the launch of the competition, as of November 18, the region's coal production has completed 101.01 percent of the overproduction plan, and the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau has completed 102.01 percent of the overproduction plan. In terms of savings, the region has turned over 13.6 billion yuan to the national treasury. The state-owned coal mine system in Central-South China is fully confident of over fulfilling this year's Increase Production and Practice Economy plan.
	The main reason for the achievements of the state-owned coal mine system in Central-South China in the Increase Production and Practice Economy campaign is that the problem of backward tunneling has been solved. From January to July, the state-owned coal mine system in the region only completed 69 percent of the tunneling task. The Jiaozuo Mining Bureau had six mining faces, and the Pingxiang Mining Bureau had eight mining faces, but none of them had backup mining faces, which affected balanced production. After the launch of the Increase Production and Practice Economy competition, leading cadres of various mining bureaus went deep into the mine pits and carefully studied these situations, further realizing that tunneling is an important preparation for reproduction and expanded reproduction, as well as a major content of the Increase Production and Practice Economy campaign. Therefore, they actively adopted economic, rapid, and coal-gaining methods to design tunneling roadways. After the implementation of this active measure, the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau can tunnel 14,646 meters in the fourth quarter, with an average of more than five months of coal production; the Pingxiang Mining Bureau can tunnel 2,065 meters, with an average of nine months of coal production. This has prepared favorable conditions for the Increase Production and Practice Economy campaign and next year's production work.

    华北区国营煤矿提前完成掘进计划
    中南区国营煤矿改进掘进工作产量提高
    华北区国营煤矿提前三十七天，超额百分之零点二三完成了全年掘进进尺计划。各矿掘进工人已为一九五四年准备了足够四个月以上时间开采的煤量，给明春生产和原煤增产准备了有利条件。保证了华北区国营煤矿明年对三百多个工矿、交通、企业及十八个省、市人民用煤的源源供应。
    为了加强掘进工作，华北煤矿管理局曾几次开会，纠正了部分干部的只顾突击增产、忽视掘进的思想，研究改进掘进工作。一九五二年第四季度，华北区有些矿为了突击完成增产任务，忽视掘进工作，甚至干脆停止了掘进工作，以致今年第一季度没有采煤工作面。如京西房山矿今年第一季度因没有采煤工作面，只好减少回采，集中力量加强掘进工作，结果产量下降了一倍，到第三季度初，才恢复了原来的生产能力。在加强掘进工作时，各矿都固定了掘进小组，增加了掘进工人，加强了对掘进工作的技术指导。如大同、开滦等矿每周举行一次掘进生产会议，交流经验和解决问题。各矿并积极改进掘进工作的条件。原来机械化程度较低、工作方法较落后的开滦煤矿，目前使用电钻、实行多孔道循环作业的掘进小组，已占总数的百分之四十五左右，比今年年初增加了一倍。各矿掘进工人为了完成和超额完成国家计划，表现了高度的积极性。很多掘进小组都根据具体情况，积极推广了空心爆破、深孔作业、成品道岔、成品棚子、平行龟裂法、循环作业等先进经验。京西房山矿的掘进工人，改进了平行龟裂法，创造了独眼拉槽的工作方法，不但提高了掘进效率，还大大减少了火药和雷管的消耗。大同煤矿掘进工人连万禄曾四次研究装炮前进法，解决了放炮中的水害问题及瞎炮问题。增产节约运动开展后，全国著名的马六孩、连万禄小组，以月进七百五十公尺的条件，首先向全国掘进工人发起了挑战竞赛。他们在十月份已达到月进七百六十六公尺七十公分，超额完成了竞赛计划。华北各矿响应马六孩、连万禄小组挑战竞赛的，有阳泉李胜和小组、开滦杨成瑞队等十三个掘进组、队。全区百分之八十以上的掘进小组，都展开了劳动竞赛。目前，各矿正在继续努力，为明年准备下更充足的煤量和合乎规格的采煤工作面。

    中南区国营煤矿系统，自从增产节约运动深入开展后，已出现了不少新气象。中南区国营煤矿系统原计划增产两万吨原煤，节约一百七十五亿元，争取达到一百九十亿元。这个计划布置到矿务局后，各矿务局经过发动群众算细账，增产节约计划大大超过了原来的计划。竞赛开展后，至十一月十八日止，全区产煤量已完成超产计划百分之一百零一点零一，焦作矿务局已完成超产计划百分之一百零二点零一。在节约方面，全区已上缴国库一百三十六亿元。中南区国营煤矿系统，完全有把握超额完成今年的增产节约计划。
    中南国营煤矿系统在增产节约运动中获得这些成绩，主要是解决了掘进落后的问题。该区国营煤矿系统一至七月份仅完成掘进任务的百分之六十九。焦作矿务局有六个回采工作面，萍乡矿务局有八个回采工作面，但都没有备用工作面，因而影响了均衡生产。在增产节约竞赛开展后，各矿务局领导干部深入矿坑，仔细研究了这些情况，进一步认识了掘进是再生产和扩大再生产的重要准备工作，也是增产节约运动中的主要内容。于是他们便积极采取经济、迅速、获得煤量多的办法，进行掘进巷道设计。实现了这个积极措施后，焦作矿务局第四季度可掘进一万四千六百四十六公尺，平均可有五个多月的采煤获得量；萍乡矿务局可掘进二千零六十五公尺，平均可有九个月的采煤获得量。这给增产节约和明年的生产工作，准备了有利的条件。
