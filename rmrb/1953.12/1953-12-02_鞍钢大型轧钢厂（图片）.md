    Anshan Iron and Steel Large Rolling Mill
    Our reporter Zhu Bo photographed

    Yu Guifeng, a processing line operator, used to be a housewife. She has learned technology quickly in seven or eight months. Now she can skillfully master the operating technology. This is her situation when she is test-running the lathe. The function of the lathe is to flatten the two ends of the steel rail.

    This is a large hot saw. Without automated equipment, it would be impossible to operate such a large machine. Its function is to saw off steel rails, tube blanks, and section steel according to requirements.

    This is a huge central cooling platform. Workers only need to move the buttons on the No. 8 control platform in the distance to turn or move the steel rails and section steel on the platform.

    加工线操纵工于桂凤过去是家庭妇女，在七、八个月中学习技术进步很快，现在已能熟练地掌握操作技术，这是她在试转镟床时的情形。镟床的作用是把钢轨的两端镟平。
    这是大型的热锯，如果没有自动化设备，就不可能操纵这样大的机器，它的作用是根据要求把钢轨、管胚、型钢锯断。
    这是面积巨大的中央冷却台，工人只要在远处的八号操作台上搬动着电钮，就能使钢轨和型钢在台上翻身或移动。
