Doing a good job in winter manure collection and preparing sufficient fertilizer for next year's production is an important link in striving for increased grain and cotton production next year. In recent years, although the amount of fertilizer applied to farmland and the area of fertilizer application in my country have increased year by year, and the quality of fertilizer has also improved, it still cannot keep up with the needs of agricultural production increase. In particular, this year, in order to strive for a bumper harvest in both wheat and autumn crops, new farming techniques were promoted and more fertilizer was applied. However, many places were busy with drought resistance and flood control this summer, and little fertilizer was collected. The autumn-sown wheat area has also expanded significantly, and most of the fertilizer reserves have been put into production. This makes this winter's manure collection work even more important.

At present, the most important problem in manure collection work is that some rural work cadres do not have sufficient understanding of the role of mobilizing farmers to increase manure collection. Some people emphasize improving farming techniques but do not pay attention to applying fertilizer. Some people have the idea of ​​relying solely on commercial fertilizers and do not recognize the importance of increasing the application of farm manure. Some agricultural production cooperative cadres also do not actively lead members to collect manure, formulate methods to encourage members to collect manure, and allow good fertilizers such as human and animal manure and small ashes to be lost, while entrusting supply and marketing cooperatives to transport fertilizer thousands of miles from big cities. They do not understand that increasing manure collection and applying farm manure rich in organic matter is a most basic task for cultivating land and increasing yields. Therefore, they do not actively lead farmers to carry out manure collection campaigns, but instead believe that manure has been collected every year, the source of fertilizer has been exhausted, and there is no fertilizer to collect in winter.

Organizing the supply of commercial fertilizers (mainly chemical fertilizers; in the future, soybean cake should generally be used as livestock feed) is naturally a way to solve the fertilizer problem. Over the years, the amount of fertilizer supplied by the state to farmers has greatly increased, which has played a certain role in developing agricultural production and increasing crop yields. However, the country's industry is not yet developed and the amount of commercial fertilizer that can be supplied is limited. Even if the country can supply a large amount of commercial fertilizer, it can only be used as a supplementary fertilizer. Because chemical fertilizer is an inorganic fertilizer, if too much of this fertilizer is used without properly combining it with farm manure containing a large amount of organic matter, it is easy to make the soil harden, destroy the soil structure, and reduce yields. At the same time, excessive use of commercial fertilizers will inevitably increase production costs, reduce farmers' actual income, affect farmers' lives, and weaken farmers' ability to expand reproduction.

The source of farm manure is extremely rich, and it is by no means as some cadres say that "the source of fertilizer has been exhausted" and "there is no fertilizer to collect in winter." Farm manure can be mainly divided into human manure, stable manure, compost, smoked fertilizer, green manure, and plant ash. As long as we attach importance to manure collection work and strengthen leadership over manure collection work, these sources of fertilizer can be found everywhere in the countryside. For example, the agricultural leadership organs in the Northeast region, in response to the local situation of extensive cultivation and failure to pay attention to manure collection despite the abundance of manure sources, put forward the slogan of "five haves (people have toilets, pigs have pens, livestock have sheds, chickens have roosts, ashes have storage), three diligences (diligent rising, diligent padding, diligent sweeping)." Over the past three years, the area of fertilizer application as a percentage of cultivated land has increased from 45 percent in 1949 to 70 percent in 1953, and the amount of fertilizer applied per unit area has also increased from 1,000 catties per mu to 2,000 catties. Another example is Youxi County in Fujian Province, which only used three types of fertilizers before liberation: human manure, animal manure, and plant ash. After liberation, through in-depth and specific leadership, fertilizer sources were sought, thereby expanding the utilization of fertilizer sources; and the method of "building fertilizer plants" in the fields was promoted, taking materials locally to reduce the difficulty of carrying manure due to high mountains and long roads. This not only increased the types of fertilizers, but also significantly increased the amount of fertilizer applied. According to the materials of Huang Qingqi Mutual Aid Group in Xiaqiao Township, District 6 of the county, the average amount of fertilizer applied per mu before liberation was 6 dan, 13.5 dan per mu in 1952, and 20 dan per mu in 1953. Yields have also increased year by year. The average yield per mu in Yatang Township of the county before liberation was 328 catties, 340 catties in 1951, and 407 catties in 1952. In the autumn and winter manure collection campaign this year, the leadership organs of Hongdong County, Shanxi Province, convened a meeting of district and village cadres and agricultural production cooperative directors, and through calculating fertilizer accounts, found eleven ways to collect fertilizer, which can achieve the goal of increasing fertilizer application by 500 catties per mu on 70 percent of the county's cultivated land. The work team of the Hejian County Committee of Hebei Province and the district cadres of various districts went deep into the masses to overcome the "winter rest" thinking of the masses and cadres and the ideas that "manure collection does not require leadership" and "manure collection is the same old thing." They carefully summarized the methods of winter manure collection by the masses, and introduced the local farmers' examples of increasing production by using crushed soil, leaves, and rotten grass to compost fertilizer, which encouraged the enthusiasm of farmers in collecting manure. These practices are all very good.

Due to the different conditions for manure collection, in leading manure collection work, each region should pay attention to grasping the main key to increasing manure collection in the local area, not only to find the main source of fertilizer in the local area, but also not to give up all small sources of fertilizer that can be utilized. Generally speaking, in the southern rice-growing areas, efforts should be focused on organizing farmers to strengthen the fertilization management of green manure fields, improve the yield per unit area, and mobilize the masses to raise more pigs, collect more human and animal manure, dig more pond mud, make water fertilizer, repair mud boats, dig river mud, burn lime, and so on. On the plains north of the Huai River and south of the Great Wall, in areas with a habit of manure collection, efforts should be focused on improving the utilization of fertilizer sources. Most of these areas do not use human urine, but human urine has a high nitrogen content. According to experiments, the nitrogen content of ten catties of urine is equivalent to the nitrogen content of one catty of soybean cake. In these areas, the application of human urine should be vigorously promoted, and pig raising and manure collection should be developed at the same time. In the northwest, northeast, Suiyuan, Inner Mongolia, and many areas within the pass where "people have no toilets and livestock have no pens," efforts should be focused on mobilizing farmers to dig deep pit latrines, build pig pens, repair stables, and fully utilize existing human and animal manure and fertilizer sources such as residual branches and dead leaves. In mountainous and hilly areas, efforts should be focused on promoting sheep lying on the ground and appropriately developing livestock. In cotton-growing areas, efforts should be focused on promoting the use of oil cake to feed livestock and applying livestock manure to the land. In areas with convenient transportation and near coal mining areas, efforts should be focused on establishing coal stations, organizing farmers to transport coal and burn coal, and freeing up straw to increase composting. In some areas that rely solely on the application of commercial fertilizers and do not pay attention to manure collection, such as the Tianjin Special District of Hebei Province and areas near Guangzhou City, efforts should be focused on persuading farmers to accumulate fertilizer by calculating costs.

In this winter's manure collection work, all localities should use production summary meetings, winter technical training courses, agricultural exhibitions, and other forms to strengthen technical guidance to farmers on manure collection, fertilization, and fertilizer storage. The same fertilizer can be utilized to different degrees due to different methods of accumulation, storage, and application. Many places only know to tell farmers to collect manure, but rarely ask about how to store it and how to apply it. According to experiments by the Zhejiang Agricultural Science Research Institute, the nitrogen fertilizer loss of general human manure without shade, cover, or water dilution is more than half. The fertilizer effect is also lost when human urine is mixed with plant ash. Using soybean cake to feed pigs and using pig manure on the land is originally a good method, but many areas are accustomed to directly applying soybean cake and soybeans to the ground. All of these are very wasteful, so it is necessary to explain to farmers how to collect fertilizer. Farmers in my country have always had rich experience in manure collection, and there are manure collection experts and good methods of manure collection, fertilization, and fertilizer preservation in various places. These good experiences and good methods should be well summarized and promoted in various places.

Along with the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement and the state-owned farm enterprise, a new issue has been raised for the leadership of manure collection work. In agricultural production cooperatives and state-owned farms, doing a good job in manure collection and attaching importance to the use of farm manure is an important link in doing a good job in business management, reducing production costs, increasing income, and increasing yields. Generally speaking, agricultural production cooperatives should rationally stipulate manure prices to fully utilize the enthusiasm of members in increasing manure collection. Some larger-scale agricultural production cooperatives with conditions and local state-owned farms, in addition to greatly increasing the accumulation of human and animal manure and composting, should also prepare for trying out reasonable crop rotation and planting alfalfa and other green manures. Mechanized state-owned farms, in addition to developing animal husbandry to increase stable manure, should also prepare for trying out reasonable crop rotation and grass-field rotation. In short, state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives should use their own superior conditions to do a good job in manure collection, fertilization, and soil cultivation, and set an example for farmers.

    做好冬季积肥工作
    方原　陈启略
    做好冬季积肥工作，给明年生产准备充足的肥料，是争取明年粮食和棉花增产的一个重要环节。几年来我国农田施肥量和施肥面积虽然逐年增加，肥料质量也有所提高，但仍然赶不上农业增产的需要。特别是今年各地为了争取麦秋两季丰收，推广了新的耕作技术，增施了肥料，而今年夏天许多地方忙于抗旱防涝，积肥很少，秋播小麦面积又显著扩大，肥料后备大都投入生产，这就使得今年冬季的积肥工作更形重要。
    目前在积肥工作中最主要的问题是：有些农村工作干部对于发动农民增积肥料的作用认识不足，有的人强调改进耕作技术，却不注意施肥料；有的人有单纯依靠商品肥料的思想，不认识增施农家肥料的重要性。还有些农业生产合作社的干部，也不积极领导社员积肥，订出鼓励社员积肥的办法，听任社内的人畜粪便和小灰等好肥料散失掉，而托供销合作社到大城市去千里运肥。他们不了解增积肥料，增施含有丰富有机质的农家肥料，对培养地力，提高产量乃是一项最基本的工作，因而不积极领导农民开展积肥运动，反认为年年积肥，肥源已经挖尽，冬季无肥可积。
    组织商品肥料（主要是化学肥料，今后豆饼一般应作牲畜饲料）的供应，自然是解决肥料问题的一个办法，历年来国家供应农民的肥料已有很大的增加，对发展农业生产提高农作物的产量起了一定的作用。但是目前国家的工业还不发达，能够供应的商品肥料有限，而且即使国家能够大量供应商品肥料，它也只能作为辅助肥料。因为化学肥料是一种无机肥料，如果过多地使用这种肥料，不把这种肥料和含有大量有机质的农家肥料适当配合使用，就容易使土壤板结，破坏土壤结构，降低产量。同时过多地使用商品肥料，结果就必然要提高生产成本，减少农民的实际收入，影响农民的生活，削弱农民扩大再生产的能力。
    农家肥料的来源是极其丰富的，绝不像某些干部所说的“肥源已经挖尽”，“冬季无肥可积”。农家肥料主要的可分为人粪尿、厩肥、堆肥、熏肥、绿肥、草木灰等几种，只要我们重视积肥工作，加强对积肥工作的领导，这些肥料的来源在农村是到处都有的。如东北区的农业领导机关针对当地耕作粗放，粪源多而不注意积肥的情况，提出“五有（人有厕所、猪有圈、牲口有棚、鸡有架、灰有仓），三勤（勤起、勤垫、勤打扫）”的口号，三年来施肥面积占耕地面积已由一九四九年的百分之四十五提高到一九五三年的百分之七十，单位面积施肥量也由每亩一千斤提高到二千斤。又如福建尤溪县解放前只利用人粪、畜粪、草木灰三种肥料，解放后经过深入具体领导，寻找肥源，因而扩大了肥源的利用；并推广在田边“搭肥厂”的办法，就地取材，减少山高路远挑粪的困难，这样不但增加了肥料的种类，施肥量也显著增加。据该县六区下桥乡黄清起互助组的材料，解放前平均每亩施肥六担，一九五二年每亩施肥达十三担半，一九五三年则达到二十担。产量也逐年提高，该县鸭塘乡解放前平均每亩产三百二十八斤，一九五一年为三百四十斤，一九五二年达四百零七斤。今年秋冬季积肥运动中，山西省洪洞县领导机关召开区村干部和农业生产合作社社长会议，通过算肥料账，找出了十一个积肥门路，可以达到全县百分之七十的耕地每亩增施五百斤肥料的目标。河北省河间县委工作组和各区区干部深入群众克服了群众和干部的“歇冬”思想和“积肥不用领导”、“积肥是老一套”等思想，认真总结了群众冬季积肥的办法，并介绍了当地农民利用碎土、树叶、烂草沤肥增产的实例，鼓舞了农民的积肥积极性。这些做法都是很好的。
    由于积肥条件的不尽相同，在领导积肥工作中，各个地区应注意抓住当地增积肥料的主要关键，既要找到当地的主要肥源，又要不放弃一切可以利用的细小肥源。一般说来，南方水稻地区应着重组织农民加强绿肥田的施肥管理，提高单位面积产量，并发动群众多喂猪、多积人畜粪尿、多挖塘泥、制水肥、修泥船、挖河泥、烧石灰等等。在淮河以北、长城以南的平原上，积肥较有习惯的地区，应该着重提高肥源的利用。这类地区大部分没有利用人尿，而人尿的含氮量很高。据试验，十斤尿的含氮量就相当于一斤豆饼的含氮量，在这些地区应该大力提倡施用人尿，同时发展养猪积肥。在西北、东北、绥远、内蒙古以及关内许多“人无厕所、牲畜无圈”的地区，应该着重动员农民挖深坑茅厕，垒猪圈，修厩舍，并充分利用现有人畜粪尿和残枝枯叶等肥源。在山岳、丘陵地区应着重提倡羊卧地，并适当发展牲畜。在棉区应着重提倡用油饼喂牲畜，用牲畜粪上地。在交通方便和煤矿区附近的地区，应着重建立煤站，组织农民运煤烧煤，腾出秸秆增沤堆肥。在某些单纯依靠施用商品肥料而不重视积肥的地区，如河北省天津专区、广州市附近等地区，应着重用计算成本的方法说服农民积攒肥料。
    在今年冬季积肥工作中，各地应利用生产总结会和冬季技术训练班、农业展览会等形式，加强对农民的积肥、施肥和保管肥料的技术指导。同样的肥料，由于积攒、保管、施用的方法不同，利用的程度也有所不同。许多地方只知叫农民攒粪，至于怎样保管？怎样施用？却很少过问。据浙江农业科学研究所试验，一般没有遮阴、加盖、加水稀释的人粪尿，氮肥损失在一半以上。人尿和草木灰混合施用，肥效也就散失了。用豆饼喂猪，用猪粪上地，本来是一种好办法，但是很多地区却习惯把豆饼、豆子直接上到地里。凡此种种，浪费都很大，因此必须向农民讲清楚如何攒肥。我国农民向来就有丰富的积肥经验，各地都有积肥能手，和好的积肥、施肥、保存肥料的办法，这些好经验好办法，各地都应该很好地加以总结和推广。
    伴随着互助合作运动和国营农场事业的发展，给积肥工作的领导提出了一个新的问题。在农业生产合作社内和国营农场内，搞好积肥工作，重视利用农家肥料，是搞好经营管理工作，降低生产成本，增加收入，提高产量的一个重要环节。一般说来，农业生产合作社，应该合理地规定粪肥价格，充分发挥社员增积肥料的积极性。一些规模较大的有条件的农业生产合作社和地方国营农场，除了大量增积人畜粪尿，沤制堆肥等外，并应为试行合理倒茬，试种苜蓿等绿肥作好准备。机械化的国营农场，除应发展饲畜业增积厩肥外，也应作好试行合理倒茬和草田轮作的准备工作。总之，国营农场和农业生产合作社，应利用本身的优越条件，做好积肥、施肥、培养地力的工作，向农民示范。
