    It is Necessary to Strengthen the Party's Leadership over Rural Economic Work

    The Party's basic task in rural areas during the transition period is to develop the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement and gradually realize the socialist transformation of agriculture. However, the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement must be coordinated and supported by national finance, trade, supply and marketing cooperation, credit cooperation, and other economic work. Without these economic works, agricultural production will be difficult to develop, the mutual aid and cooperation movement will be difficult to consolidate and improve, and farmers will be in danger of embarking on the capitalist road. The Party's responsibility in rural areas is extremely important in order to correctly lead rural economic work.

    The current rural situation in our country is basically that the small-peasant economy occupies a dominant position. A correct analysis of the characteristics of this small-peasant economy is the basis for our leadership of rural work. The small-peasant economy is scattered and unorganized and lacks the ability to resist natural disasters. However, in order to develop production and maintain their lives, they demand to sell their agricultural and sideline products in exchange for necessary means of production and means of livelihood. When there is a bumper harvest, they demand to find outlets for their surplus grain and money. When they encounter large consumption due to weddings, funerals, illnesses, or are hit by natural disasters, they must rely on loans to solve their production and livelihood difficulties. This determines their dependence on economic forces such as industry, commerce, and credit. If we can promptly solve the problem of marketing agricultural and sideline products, promptly solve the problem of material supply, and promptly solve the problem of adjusting and circulating rural funds, then the small-peasant economy will form an alliance with the socialist state-owned economy and the semi-socialist cooperative economy to jointly fight against the speculative behavior of capitalist commerce, fight against spontaneous capitalist forces, and continue to advance on the socialist road. If we cannot meet these economic demands of individual farmers, then the farmers will go to private merchants and usurers to find a way out. Private merchants will take the opportunity to plunder farmers' agricultural products at low prices and supply farmers with industrial products at high prices; usurers will also take the opportunity to engage in high-interest exploitation of farmers. This will promote the small-peasant economy to form an alliance with the capitalist economy and will not lead to socialism. Therefore, the countryside is a vast economic battlefield. If socialism does not occupy it, capitalism will.

    In the Chinese countryside after the land reform, socialist and capitalist factors are fighting there every day and every hour. In order to ensure that socialism will ultimately win in the countryside, we must actively organize all socialist and semi-socialist economic forces today and take all necessary measures to conduct planned leadership of the small-peasant economy and gradually completely occupy this vast economic battlefield in the countryside. This means that, in addition to continuing to consolidate and improve existing agricultural production mutual aid teams and production cooperatives, and actively and steadily developing more and larger mutual aid teams and production cooperatives, we must also use state-owned stores and supply and marketing cooperatives to purchase and sell farmers' agricultural and sideline products at reasonable prices to increase farmers' income; at the same time, we must supply farmers with urgently needed agricultural tools, fertilizers, and daily necessities in large quantities to meet farmers' needs in life and production. We must also use the state bank to issue agricultural production loans and develop credit cooperatives to adjust rural funds and solve farmers' difficulties in production and life; at the same time, we must carry out rural savings work, absorb rural idle funds, and help farmers accumulate production funds. After a series of economic work, we can connect the cities and the countryside, connect industry and agriculture, and connect the working class and the broad masses of peasants, guiding the peasants to the road of socialism. Farmers believe most in facts and their own experience. As long as they compare the socialist economy with the capitalist economy again and again, they will be able to clearly recognize who is helping them, who is exploiting them, who is guiding them to happiness, and who is guiding them to poverty. With our active education and guidance, and in their own personal experience, they will gradually leave the capitalist economy and move closer to the socialist economy. In this way, there will also be conditions to gradually organize thousands of scattered small producers from the three aspects of production, supply and marketing, and credit, incorporate them into the track of national planning, and transition to socialism.

    Therefore, rural economic work has a huge role in supporting agricultural production and promoting the socialist transformation of agriculture. Facts have proved that wherever Party organizations pay attention to this work, the mutual aid and cooperation movement has gained vigorous development. The Laiyang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China in Shandong Province, in the spring of this year, combined the consolidation of production mutual aid and cooperative organizations, mobilized cadres from supply and marketing cooperatives and banks to go deep into the masses to conduct investigations and research, and, according to seasonal changes and the actual needs of farmers' production and life, planned to carry out supply and marketing and credit work, so that supply and marketing and credit work were closely integrated with production. For example, chemical fertilizers were promoted during wheat hoeing and topdressing; walking plows were promoted during spring plowing; and waterwheels were promoted during drought prevention and resistance. When the masses had difficulties in purchasing agricultural tools and chemical fertilizers, banks and credit cooperatives provided loan support. Because these economic works effectively played the role of serving production, the masses deeply realized that they could not do without supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives. Many production mutual aid teams and cooperatives signed "triangular contracts" with banks and supply and marketing cooperatives to cooperate with each other. In less than four months, they supplied farmers in the entire area with 28.58 million jin of various fertilizers, 1,922 walking plows, 547 waterwheels, more than 4,800 pieces of various small agricultural tools, 1.98 million jin of cotton seeds, and 3,223 head of livestock. These means of production were all put into production in a timely manner, creating conditions for the bumper harvests in summer and autumn. There are many, many more similar facts in various places.

    This fully demonstrates that, due to the development of rural economic work, not only have farmers been exempted from the intermediate exploitation of merchants, severely cracked down on usury activities, and cut off or weakened the connection between farmers and the capitalist economy, but also have met the needs of farmers in production and life, solved the difficulties of farmers, thereby stimulating farmers' production enthusiasm, improving farmers' political awareness, and directly promoting the socialist transformation of agriculture. On the contrary, wherever Party organizations abandon or relax their leadership over rural economic work, the pace of economic work shows chaos. For example, in some places, in the purchase of grain and other agricultural and sideline products, there have been phenomena of mutual shirking or competition between state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives; or in the purchase work, they do not have close contact with the bank and allocate funds in a timely manner, resulting in a lack of purchase; or some state-owned stores and supply and marketing cooperatives cannot allocate a large number of materials in a timely manner, so that farmers cannot purchase the required means of production and means of livelihood from state-owned stores and supply and marketing cooperatives after selling grain or receiving loans from the bank; coupled with poor market management, some speculative merchants are able to take the opportunity to raise prices and kill prices, exploiting farmers and disrupting the market, which has fueled the development of spontaneous capitalist forces in rural areas. Wealthy farmers hoard surplus grain to seek exorbitant profits and use surplus funds to engage in speculative activities everywhere. According to a survey in Zhuyi Township, District 1, Fengjie County, Sichuan Province, more than 230 farmers put down production and went to do business in the middle of this year's autumn harvest. At that time, sesame was on the market, and they purchased more than 80,000 jin in 20 days. Some of them also processed it and sold it at high prices when the cooperative was short of oil. In some areas of Hubei Province, because farmers went out to run businesses all day long, production was abandoned, and even the production mutual aid teams collapsed. If this phenomenon continues to develop, it will inevitably overwhelm the mutual aid and cooperation movement, damage the worker-peasant alliance, undermine farmers' enthusiasm for agricultural production, and fuel the development of rural speculation and high-interest exploitation, causing the re-differentiation of rural classes, making a few people rich and becoming rich peasants and speculative merchants, and making the production and life of the majority of people lose their security, and finally embark on the road of poverty and bankruptcy.

    At present, in the work of socialist transformation of agriculture in many regions, it has become apparent that other rural economic works cannot keep up with the needs of agricultural development. Not only has it not well promoted the socialist transformation of agriculture, but it has even hindered the socialist transformation of agriculture to varying degrees. Therefore, local party committees, especially county and district party committees, must strengthen their leadership over rural economic work to make it truly serve the socialist transformation of agriculture. The main method of strengthening leadership is to earnestly place the various economic works in rural areas under the unified leadership of the local party committee and closely coordinate with agricultural production in arranging and deploying work in each period. The party committees in some places only stay at the verbal level of unified leadership, without taking necessary and specific measures. The party committees in some places even mistakenly believe that economic departments have their own business systems, and the party committees are not familiar with the business and are not good at leading, so they do not lead. In this way, the work of the economic departments cannot be carried out under unified leadership, and each acts on its own, and the strength cannot be concentrated. Therefore, local party committees, especially county and district party committees, should regularly discuss the work guidelines, tasks, and work plans of various economic departments at the party committee, and unify the deployment and properly arrange various economic works according to seasonal changes and production needs, so that they closely cooperate with each other, support each other, and jointly serve agricultural production and the socialist transformation of agriculture. At the same time, only by grasping the overall economic situation can the party committee effectively lead rural economic work, and can also examine whether the work plans of the economic departments meet the current needs; only in inspection work can he guide them in implementing the party's policies in a timely manner. On the other hand, the implementation of centralized and unified leadership by the party committee also requires an inspection of the decentralized phenomenon of some economic departments in the past. Leading cadres of various economic departments should frequently report economic conditions and work conditions to the party committee in their daily work, and economic measures involving guidelines and policies must be discussed and approved by the party committee.

    The Party committee must strengthen the ideological and political work of cadres in economic departments. The thinking of cadres in economic departments is relatively complex, especially because most of them are young people who have not been working for a long time, and they are often close to private merchants in their work, and they are extremely susceptible to capitalist management ideas and management styles. For example, they lack the viewpoint of serving production and serving the masses, and only know how to make money, and are willing to violate policies in order to make more money. Therefore, party committees at all levels must lead cadres in economic departments to study the theories of Marxism-Leninism and the party's policies and policies. At present, we should concentrate our efforts on organizing the study of the party's general line and general tasks, so that they can clearly understand what the guidelines and tasks of rural economic work are in the transition period, who should be served, and who should be fought against, in order to improve the ideological and political level and the policy and business level of cadres. On the other hand, party committees at all levels should also pay attention to cultivating and improving the cadres of these economic departments in actual work. The Anda County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Heilongjiang Province frequently convenes meetings of party branch secretaries and political work cadres from state-owned commerce, supply and marketing cooperation, and banks to review work and study and exchange political work experience. Because the county party committee has strengthened the political leadership of these departments, it has basically overcome the mercenary views of some cadres and gradually established the ideological style of serving production and serving the masses. Now many people have become work models. This shows that the party committee must often approach the cadres of the economic departments, understand their ideological situation and work situation, solve their difficulties in a timely manner, and frequently absorb them to participate in necessary meetings, and guide them to read necessary documents, so that they can work with peace of mind, so as to give play to their initiative and creativity, encourage and commend them for creating various work methods that are in line with rural realities, and deeply root their work in the masses. At the same time, the work of the Party and the Communist Youth League in the economic departments must also be strengthened, and we must always pay attention to discovering and cultivating activists, and promptly absorb outstanding cadres who have emerged in the work into the organizations of the Party and the League, so as to establish the Party's leading core among the masses, unite the broad masses of cadres, and jointly shoulder the glorious task of carrying out the socialist transformation of agriculture.

    The party committee must carry out in-depth publicity among the communist party members, communist youth league members, and the broad masses of peasants about issues related to the masses' own economic lives, so that they realize that, in order to develop agricultural production, to move towards socialism, and to live a happy and prosperous life, they must rely on the support of state-owned trade, banks, and supply and marketing cooperation and credit cooperation. It is impossible for anyone to develop agricultural production in isolation if they want to leave these economic organizations. In the past, because we did not publicize the issues related to the masses' own economic lives enough, the party's policies could not often be implemented among the masses, and good things were turned into bad things. For example, promoting new agricultural tools was originally a good thing, but because in-depth publicity was not carried out, farmers were forced to purchase them, causing resistance from the farmers and making the work impossible to carry out. However, if the truth is made clear, the masses will scramble to purchase new agricultural tools, and at the same time, they will actively sell grain and industrial raw materials to the state. Zhao Yuan County, Shandong Province, only handed over the promotion of new agricultural tools to a few cadres of the supply and marketing cooperative in the past year, so the promotion work was difficult to carry out and the cadres were depressed. Later, the county party secretary and county magistrate led 180 district and township cadres to first learn the technology of using new agricultural tools, and then go deep into the masses to carry out publicity, and proposed to the masses to guarantee teaching, guarantee learning, and guarantee repairs, so that the masses dispelled their concerns, recognized the benefits of the new agricultural tools, and learned to use them, and the promotion work was smoothly carried out. In just over 20 days, more than 700 new-style walking plows were promoted. People who were regarded by the masses as "apportioning chemical fertilizers and forcing the sale of walking plows" have become cadres welcomed by the masses. This proves that as long as the masses truly understand these principles and truly feel the benefits for them, they will actively and automatically help the work of the economic departments. With a broad mass base for rural economic work, business will flourish.

### 必须加强党对农村经济工作的领导

    必须加强党对农村经济工作的领导
    过渡时期党在农村工作的基本任务，是发展农业生产互助合作运动，逐步实现对农业的社会主义改造。但是，农业生产互助合作运动必须有国家金融、贸易以及供销合作、信贷合作等经济工作的配合和支持。如果离开这些经济工作，那么农业生产就很难发展，互助合作运动就很难巩固和提高，农民就有走向资本主义道路的危险。为了正确地领导农村的经济工作，党在农村中的责任是极为重大的。
    我国现时农村情况，基本上是小农经济占着优势。对于这种小农经济特点的正确分析是我们领导农村工作的依据。小农经济散漫而无组织，对自然灾害的侵袭，缺乏抵抗能力。但是，他们为了发展生产，为了维持生活，便要求出卖自己的农业和副业产品，换取必需的生产资料和生活资料；丰收了，便要求为余粮余钱寻找出路，遇有婚、丧、疾病等大量消费，或是遭受到自然灾害的打击，便要依靠借贷来解决生产和生活上的困难。这就决定了它对工业、商业、信贷等经济力量的依赖关系。如果我们能够及时地解决农业和副业产品的推销问题，能够及时地解决物资供应问题，能够及时地解决农村资金的调剂周转问题，那么小农经济便会和社会主义国营经济和半社会主义的合作经济结成联盟，共同去和资本主义商业的投机行为斗争，去和自发的资本主义势力斗争，继续在社会主义道路上前进。如果我们不能满足个体农民的这些经济要求，那么农民便会到私商和高利贷者那里去找出路，私商也就会趁机以低价掠夺农民的农产品，以高价供应农民工业品；高利贷者也就会趁机活动，高利盘剥农民。这就促使小农经济去和资本主义经济结成联盟，就走不到社会主义。所以说，农村是一个广阔的经济阵地，如果社会主义不去占领，资本主义就要去占领。
    在土地改革后的中国农村中，社会主义因素和资本主义因素，每日每时都在那里进行着斗争。我们为了保证社会主义将来在农村获得最后的胜利，今天就必须积极地组织社会主义的和半社会主义的一切经济力量，采取一切必要措施，对小农经济进行有计划的领导，逐步地完全占领农村这个广阔的经济阵地。这就是说，除了继续巩固和提高现有的农业生产互助组及生产合作社，积极而稳步地发展更多更大的互助组及生产合作社以外，我们还必须通过国营商店和供销合作社，以合理的价格，收购和推销农民的农产品和副产品，以增加农民的收入；同时大量供应农民迫切需要的农具、肥料以及日用必需品，以满足农民在生活和生产上的要求。我们还必须通过国家银行，发放农业生产贷款，发展信贷合作社，以调剂农村资金，解决农民在生产和生活上的困难；同时开展农村储蓄工作，吸收农村游资，帮助农民积累生产资金。经过这一系列的经济工作，便可以把城市和乡村联系起来，把工业和农业联系起来，把工人阶级和广大农民联系起来，引导农民走向社会主义的大道。农民是最相信事实和自己的经验的。只要他们经过一而再、再而三地把社会主义经济和资本主义经济对比以后，就能够认识清楚，谁是扶助他们的，谁是剥削他们的，谁引导他们走向幸福，谁引导他们走向贫困。在我们积极教育和引导下，在他们切身体验中，他们便会逐渐离开资本主义经济，而和社会主义经济靠拢。这样，也就有条件把千千万万散漫的小生产者，从生产、供销和信贷三个方面逐步组织起来，纳入国家计划的轨道，过渡到社会主义。
    所以农村经济工作对扶助农业生产，促进对农业的社会主义改造，有着巨大的作用。事实已经证明，凡是党组织注意了这个工作的地方，互助合作运动便获得了蓬勃的发展。中共山东莱阳地委，在今年春天，曾结合整顿生产互助合作组织，动员供销合作社和银行的干部深入到群众中调查研究，根据季节的变化，和农民生产和生活上的实际需要，有计划地开展供销和信贷工作，使供销和信贷工作与生产紧密结合起来。比如，在锄麦和追肥时，就推广化学肥料；春耕时，就推广步犁；在防旱抗旱时，就推广水车；群众在购买农具和化学肥料有困难时，银行和信贷合作社便给以贷款扶持。由于这些经济工作切实发挥了为生产服务的作用，使群众深深体会到离不了供销社和信贷社，许多生产互助组、合作社都与银行、供销合作社订立了
  “三角合同”，互相配合，在不到四个月的时间里，便给全专区农民供应了各种肥料两千八百五十八万斤，步犁一千九百二十二部，水车五百四十七部，各种小农具四千八百余件，棉籽一百九十八万斤，牲畜三千二百二十三头。这些生产资料都及时地投进了生产中去，为夏秋两季的丰收创造了条件。类似这样的事实，各地还有很多很多。
    这就充分说明了，由于农村经济工作的开展，不仅使农民免除了商人的中间剥削，严重地打击了高利贷活动，切断了或者削弱了农民与资本主义经济的联系，而且在生产上生活上满足了农民的需要，解决了农民的困难，从而刺激了农民的生产情绪，提高了农民的政治觉悟，直接推动了农业的社会主义改造工作的进行。反之，凡是党组织放弃或放松了对农村经济工作领导的地方，经济工作的步调便表现了混乱。比如，有些地方在粮食及其他农副产品的收购工作中，发生了国营商业和供销合作社互相推诿或互相争购的现象；或者在收购工作中，不和银行取得密切联系，及时调拨资金，以致形成脱购；或者某些国营商店和供销合作社，不能及时调拨大批物资，使农民在卖出粮食或从银行领到贷款以后，不能从国营商店和供销合作社购买到所需要的生产资料和生活资料；再加上对市场管理不善，使一些投机商人得以乘机抬价杀价，从中剥削农民，扰乱市场，这就助长了农村自发的资本主义势力的发展。富裕的农民把余粮囤积起来，谋取暴利，用剩余资金到处去进行投机活动。据四川奉节县一区朱衣乡的调查，今年秋收中间，就有二百三十多户农民，放下生产，去作买卖，当时芝麻正在上市，他们在二十天里，便收购了八万多斤，有的并进行加工，趁合作社缺油时，以高价出售。湖北省也有某些地区，因农民终日出去跑买卖，荒废了生产，使生产互助组都垮了台。这种现象如果继续发展下去，势必冲垮了互助合作运动，破坏了工农联盟，破坏农民对农业生产的积极性，助长农村投机活动和高利盘剥的发展。引起农村阶级的重新分化，使少数人发财变成了富农和投机商人，多数人的生产和生活失去保障，最后走上贫困破产的道路。
    目前不少地区在对农业进行社会主义改造的工作中，已经显出农村其他经济工作赶不上农业发展的需要，不只没有很好地促进农业社会主义改造，甚至还在程度不等地阻碍农业社会主义改造。因此，各地党委、特别是县区党委必须加强对农村经济工作的领导，使其切实为农业社会主义改造服务。加强领导的主要方法是认真把农村的各项经济工作放在地方党委的统一领导之下，在每一时期都密切配合农业生产来安排部署工作。有些地方的党委对统一领导，只是停留在口头上，而没有采取必要的和具体的措施。有些地方的党委甚至错误地认为经济部门有自己的业务系统，党委不熟悉业务，不好领导，也就不去领导。这样，就使经济部门的工作，不能在统一领导下进行，各自为政，力量不能集中。因而，各地党委特别是县区党委应在党的委员会上，经常讨论各经济部门的工作方针、任务和工作计划，根据季节的变化和生产的需要，将各项经济工作进行统一的布置和妥善的安排，使其密切配合，互相支援，共同为农业生产服务，为农业的社会主义改造服务。同时，党委只有掌握了全面的经济情况，才能对农村经济工作进行切实有力的领导，也才能审查经济部门的工作计划，是否符合当前的需要；他才能在检查工作中，及时指导他们贯彻党的政策。另一方面，实行党委集中统一领导，还要对过去某些经济部门的各自为政的分散现象进行检查。各经济部门领导干部，在日常工作中，应经常向党委汇报经济情况和工作情况，凡涉及方针、政策问题的经济措施，必须请党委讨论通过。
    党委必须加强对经济部门干部的思想政治工作。经济部门干部的思想比较复杂，特别是因为大多数是参加工作不久的青年，在工作中经常和私商接近，极容易沾染上资本主义的经营思想和经营作风。例如缺乏为生产服务为群众服务的观点，而只知道赚钱，为了多赚几个钱，不惜违反政策。因此，各级党委必须领导经济部门干部进行关于马克思、列宁主义的理论、以及党的方针政策的学习。目前，就应集中力量组织对于党的总路线和总任务的学习，使他们明确认识，在过渡时期中，农村经济工作的方针、任务是什么，应当为谁服务，向谁斗争，以提高干部的思想政治水平，和政策业务水平。另一方面，各级党委还应注意在实际工作中去培养和提高这些经济部门的干部，中共黑龙江省安达县委，便经常召集国营商业、供销合作、以及银行等部门的党支部书记和政治工作干部开会，检查工作，研究和交流政治工作经验。由于县委加强了这些部门的政治领导，基本上克服了某些干部的雇佣观点，逐渐树立了为生产为群众服务的思想作风，现在有好多人都成了工作模范。这就说明了，党委必须经常接近经济部门的干部，了解他们的思想情况和工作情况，及时解决他们的困难，经常吸收他们参加必要的会议，指导他们阅读必要的文件；使他们安心工作，以发挥他们的积极性和创造性，鼓励和表扬他们创造各种切合农村实际的工作方法，把工作的根深深地扎在群众中去。同时，经济部门中党和青年团的工作也必须加强，经常注意发现和培养积极分子，及时将工作中涌现出来的优秀干部吸收到党和团的组织中来，以树立党在群众中的领导核心，团结广大干部，共同肩负起对农业进行社会主义改造的光荣任务。
    党委必须向农村的共产党员、青年团员，及广大农民群众，深入进行有关群众切身经济生活问题的宣传，使他们认识到，要发展农业生产，要走向社会主义，要过美满幸福的生活，就必须依靠国营贸易、银行、以及供销合作、信贷合作的支持，任何人如果想离开这些经济组织而孤立地去发展农业生产，都是不可能的。过去，由于我们对群众的切身经济生活问题宣传的不够，常常使党的政策不能贯彻到群众中去，把好事办成了坏事。比如，推广新式农具，本来是件好事情，但由于没有进行深入的宣传，便强制农民购买，引起了农民的对抗情绪，使工作无法进行。但是，如果把道理讲清楚，群众便会争着去购买新式农具，同时也会踊跃地把粮食和工业原料卖给国家。山东省招远县，去年在推广新农具时，只交给供销合作社的几个干部孤立地去进行，因此推广工作很难展开，干部情绪苦闷。后来县委书记和县长便带领了一百八十名区、乡干部，首先学会使用新农具的技术，然后深入群众，进行宣传，向群众提出保教、保会、保修理，使群众打消了顾虑，认识了新农具的好处，又学会了使用，推广工作也就顺利地展开了，二十几天中，便推广了七百多部新式步犁。过去被群众看作“摊派化学肥料，强卖步犁的人”，都变成了为群众所欢迎的干部。由此证明，只要群众真正了解了这些道理，并切实感到对他们的好处以后，他们便会积极地自动地来帮助经济部门的工作。农村经济工作有了广泛的群众基础，业务便会蓬勃开展起来。
