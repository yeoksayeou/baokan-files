Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd: Karachi dispatch: According to the Lahore "Today" newspaper, the Free Pakistan Party held a mass meeting in Lahore on November 18th. The meeting passed a resolution demanding that the Pakistani government not conclude a military alliance with the United States to prevent the threat of war.

    The "Pakistan Times" published an editorial on November 24th opposing the U.S. attempt to conspire with Pakistan to form a military alliance, stating that the people of Pakistan "will always oppose any attempt to weaken Pakistan's sovereignty or use its manpower and territory to consolidate or expand Western imperialism." Regarding Eisenhower's and Dulles' denials regarding U.S.-Pakistan military negotiations, the editorial pointed out: "Both of them have spoken very vaguely on this issue." The editorial called on the Pakistani Prime Minister to "declare in clear terms that Pakistan will not participate in any military bloc of any kind." The editorial said: "Such a statement will prevent Western countries from attempting to drag Pakistan into their war plans and will eliminate the fears and doubts of our people."

    Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd: According to the Press Trust of India, New Delhi: Indian Prime Minister Nehru reiterated his concern over U.S.-Pakistan military negotiations in the People's House of the Indian Parliament on November 30th.

    Referring to U.S. President Eisenhower's statement that he had not discussed a U.S.-Pakistan military alliance "in detail" with Pakistani Governor-General Ghulam Muhammad, Nehru pointed out that certain "powerful and responsible" U.S. newspapers and periodicals had openly discussed the issue of the United States providing military aid to Pakistan in exchange for Pakistani bases. Nehru said: "There are some contradictions in these various statements. These statements show that this issue has been discussed for some time between the Pakistani government and the U.S. government, although no decision has been reached."

    Nehru reiterated India's deep concern over U.S.-Pakistan military negotiations. He said: "The Indian government has made it clear that it is watching any such event with great unease. Any further action will depend on the possible developments of such an event."

    自由巴基斯坦党反对美巴缔结军事同盟
    尼赫鲁再度对美巴军事谈判表示忧虑
    【新华社二日讯】喀喇蚩消息：据拉合尔“今天报”报道，自由巴基斯坦党十一月十八日在拉合尔召开群众大会。会上通过决议，要求巴基斯坦政府不与美国缔结军事同盟，以防免战争的威胁。
    “巴基斯坦时报”在十一月二十四日发表社论反对美国企图与巴基斯坦缔结军事同盟的阴谋说：巴基斯坦人民“将永远反对任何想削弱巴基斯坦的主权或利用其人力及领土以巩固或扩张西方帝国主义的企图”。社论在谈到艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯对于美巴军事谈判的否认声明时指出：“他们两人对这个问题的说法都是甚为闪烁其词的。”社论要求巴基斯坦总理“以明确的词句宣布巴基斯坦将不参加任何性质的军事集团”。社论说：“这样的声明将阻止西方国家企图把巴基斯坦拖进它们的战争计划中去的阴谋，并将消除我国人民的恐惧和疑虑。”
     【新华社二日讯】据印度新闻处新德里讯：印度总理尼赫鲁十一月三十日在印度国会人民院再度对美巴军事谈判表示忧虑。
    尼赫鲁在谈到美国总统艾森豪威尔关于没有与巴基斯坦总督吴拉姆·穆罕默德“详细”地讨论美巴军事同盟的声明后指出，美国某些“有势力和负责的”报纸和期刊曾毫不掩饰地谈论美国以军事援助给予巴基斯坦以交换巴基斯坦基地的问题。尼赫鲁说：“这些各种各样的说法颇有一些矛盾的地方。这些说法表明这个问题在过去已在巴基斯坦政府与美国政府之间经过一些时候的讨论，虽然并没有得出决定。”
    尼赫鲁重申印度对于美巴军事谈判的深切忧虑。他说：“印度政府曾明确地声明，它非常不安地注视着任何这样的事件。任何进一步的措施将取决于这种事件的可能的发展。”
