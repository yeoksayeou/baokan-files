The U.S. government, using the lie it fabricated about the "atrocities" of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers as a pretext, has coerced the United Nations General Assembly into passing its proposed so-called "Five-Nation Resolution" to slander the Korean and Chinese People's forces, as a tool for the United States to continue maintaining international tension. This is intolerable to all people who love peace and uphold justice. In response, Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, representing the Central People's Government of China, issued a statement on the 6th, expressing severe condemnation, deeming this resolution of the United Nations General Assembly to be illegal, slanderous, and invalid. He called on the people of the whole country and all peace-loving people of the world to be vigilant and stop the U.S. government's conspiracy to continue creating international tension and obstructing the convocation of a political conference to resolve the Korean issue. The entire Chinese people resolutely support this righteous and stern statement by Foreign Minister Zhou.

In his statement, Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai pointed out: The reason why the U.S. government wants to "use the United Nations General Assembly to peddle its fabricated and monstrous lies" at a time when the Panmunjom Korean armistice talks between the two parties are of universal concern, "is to try to divert the attention of world public opinion, maintain tension in the Far East and Asia, so that it can continue to delay the convening of the Korean political conference, thoroughly undermine the repatriation work of prisoners of war, intensify its military aggression in Southeast Asia, accelerate the rearmament of Japan, expand the establishment of a network of military bases in Asia, and promote the organization of aggressive military alliances in Asia, thereby enabling it to implement its policy of arms expansion and war preparation." We must shatter this shameful scheme of the U.S. government and not allow the U.S. aggressor group to achieve its sinister goal of confusing international opinion, inciting war psychology, and continuing arms expansion and war preparation.

Under what circumstances was the U.S. government's slanderous report on the Korean and Chinese People's forces fabricated? According to the U.S. "Newsweek," the U.S. government has been creating so-called "intelligence" in this regard since 1950 in order to carry out this slanderous propaganda against the Korean and Chinese People's forces. Lodge's report to the United Nations General Assembly "has been in preparation for at least two years." In recent months, U.S. "government legal, intelligence, and psychological warfare experts" have been "racking their brains" to "draft the details of this report." This proves that the so-called "report" submitted by the United States to the United Nations General Assembly is completely fabricated and deliberately provocative. During the war of aggression against Korea, the United States launched this kind of despicable propaganda several times, but each time it suffered a shameful failure. In the early stages of the war of aggression against Korea, MacArthur, in order to stimulate the declining morale of the U.S. troops invading Korea, fabricated a lot of absurd nonsense about the Korean and Chinese side "mistreating" prisoners of war, which was thoroughly shattered by the fact that the Korean and Chinese side released a large number of U.S. prisoners of war at the front. In the winter of 1951, in order to create an excuse to undermine the Korean armistice negotiations and to suppress the widespread anti-war sentiment among the U.S. troops at the front, the chief of the U.S. Eighth Army's Judge Advocate General's Office, Hanley, also issued a statement claiming that the Korean and Chinese People's forces had "killed" prisoners of war. However, Hanley's shameless statement was immediately and thoroughly exposed by world public opinion, putting the United States in an extremely embarrassing position. Even U.S. officers and soldiers believed that Hanley's fabrication of such lies was "irresponsible." At that time, Ridgway headquarters saw that the situation was not good and had to admit that Hanley's statement that the Korean and Chinese troops had "killed" prisoners of war "did not have solid evidence"; and Colonel Welch investigated the process of Hanley's statement, pointing out that Hanley's accusations were not based on facts and did not conform to the actual situation. Thus, Hanley's statement collapsed of its own accord. In April of this year, when the two sides in Korea exchanged sick and wounded prisoners of war, U.S. war peddlers such as Nolan, Bridges, Willie, and Short launched another slanderous propaganda campaign against the Korean and Chinese side, but because the fact that the Korean and Chinese side treated sick and wounded prisoners of war humanely was obvious to all and could not be denied, the U.S. slanderous propaganda was once again completely bankrupt. The sick and wounded prisoners of war released by the Korean and Chinese side received good medical treatment and mostly recovered their health. Even the British "Daily Mirror" published an editorial entitled "Atrocity or Lie?", pointing out that the U.S. lies were "engaging in incitement." Therefore, the U.S. provocative propaganda once again died down. Now the U.S. government is manipulating the United Nations General Assembly to pass its fabricated so-called "Five-Nation Resolution," what will be the result?

The so-called "atrocity materials" about the Korean and Chinese People's forces fabricated by the U.S. government recently caused "rare laughter" at a so-called witness hearing held in the U.S. Senate. Now the United States has wrapped these unfounded and ridiculous materials in the flag of the United Nations, which can only lead to the further and irreparable bankruptcy of the U.S. government in terms of international morality. Now, the news coming from the Americas to Australia, from the U.S. camp, is also slapping the U.S. in the face. The Chicago office of the U.S. "Newsweek" reported: "Regarding the public's reaction to the Korean atrocities, the noteworthy thing is: the public has no reaction. Readers did not call the newspapers in shock to inquire." The U.S. "St. Louis Globe-Democrat" published three fabricated photos of the Korean and Chinese troops' "atrocities," expecting some reaction, but the phone never rang even once. The U.S. "Newsweek" said that although the U.S. propaganda machine "made every effort to carry out the maximum propaganda overseas," "these news items were even less noticed," and "newspapers used at most a small paragraph to publish the news." Although Australia is one of the countries of the so-called "Five-Nation Resolution," Australian government officials do not believe the U.S.-fabricated lies about the Korean and Chinese troops' "atrocities." According to the British "Times," Australian Foreign Minister Casey stated in the House of Representatives that "investigations conducted by Australian and U.S. military authorities have proved that a statement published in Washington is inaccurate, which said that twenty of the victims of Communist atrocities in Korea were Australian prisoners of war." Australian Minister for Defence Philip McBride also had no idea of such a thing. The whole world sees that the U.S. government is such a lying and rumor-mongering government, a treacherous and deceptive government!

In its so-called "Five-Nation Resolution," the U.S. government shamelessly mentioned the Geneva Conventions of 1929 and 1949 regarding the treatment of prisoners of war and the Geneva Convention of 1949 regarding the protection of civilians in wartime. However, looking at the Geneva Conventions, which one has not been completely destroyed by the United States in the war of aggression against Korea? The U.S. aggressors' brutal and inhumane persecution, abuse, and forcible detention of our captured personnel, the insane atrocities of mass barbaric massacres of Korean civilians, and the beastly acts of using bacteriological weapons, poison gas, and napalm bombs, which one is in accordance with the Geneva Conventions? For the time being, let's not talk about the bloody crimes of the U.S. military's frenzied slaughter of our captured personnel on Geoje Island, Jeju Island, and Beongam Island, which U.S. Generals Dodd and Colson have already admitted; let's also not mention the atrocities of U.S. special agents killing our captured personnel Zhang Zilong and Zhang Liutai in the Dongchang-ri prisoner-of-war camp, which the people of the world remember vividly. Here, just one example can fully prove how absurd and shameless the U.S. government's public mention of the Geneva Conventions is! U.S. journalist Osborne wrote in the U.S. "Time" magazine published on August 21, 1950: "I have to say that this is a particularly terrifying war. Because we (the United States) have to win, we force our soldiers to take the most barbaric actions and styles on the battlefield. This barbarism is not the ordinary inevitable barbarism on the battlefield, but more cruel and barbaric than that. Regardless of whether there are enemies there, villages are completely destroyed; refugees are killed indiscriminately. The South Korean troops fighting alongside us (the United States) are also equally barbaric and inhumane. I personally saw South Korean police killing prisoners alive for fear of danger while escorting them back to the rear. When they retreated from the front line, they even strafed civilians filling the road in order to escape. The barbaric means they used to extract the information we (the United States) needed from civilians are even more unspeakable." This is the "humanitarian" behavior of the U.S. military described by U.S. journalists! The U.S. government is now publicly raising the Geneva Conventions in the United Nations General Assembly, which is nothing more than hypocrisy and cannot cover up the bloody crimes it committed in the war of aggression against Korea.

What the United Nations General Assembly should condemn is precisely these heinous crimes of the United States. However, the United Nations has not only never condemned the U.S. murderers' banditry in Korea but has consistently condoned the U.S. abuse and slander of the Korean and Chinese side. As early as 1950, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea had repeatedly protested to the United Nations, requesting the Security Council to take action to stop the U.S. military's atrocities in Korea, but the United Nations turned a deaf ear. During the more than three years of the Korean War, although the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Government of the People's Republic of China repeatedly protested, and many international organizations continuously issued appeals, demanding the maintenance of the Geneva Conventions and the Hague Conventions, the United Nations remained silent, allowing the U.S. military's atrocities in Korea to become even more rampant. If the United Nations still intends to uphold the cause of peace, then it should have severely condemned and stopped these countless bloody atrocities of the U.S. aggressors in Korea long ago. However, the United Nations has never done so, abandoning its responsibilities. On the contrary, now the United Nations General Assembly, without the participation of the Korean and Chinese side, ignoring the opposition of peace-loving people and fair-minded public opinion around the world, ignoring the just claims of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, ignoring the dissenting views of the vast majority of Asian-Arab countries, openly allows the United States to slander the Korean and Chinese side, and based on the lies of the so-called "atrocities" of the Korean and Chinese People's forces fabricated by the U.S. government, it passed the so-called "Five-Nation Resolution" jointly proposed by the United States, coerced by Britain, France, Australia, and Turkey, which slanders the Korean and Chinese People's forces, to help the United States cover up its crimes in the war of aggression against Korea. This is not only an extremely despicable practice but also completely tramples on the flag of the United Nations and once again proves that the United Nations is still willing to degenerate into a tool of the U.S. "Cold War" policy, thus making the spirit of the United Nations Charter to uphold justice disappear and the United Nations morally disgraced.

The Chinese people express infinite indignation at the U.S. government's shameless collusion to slander the Korean and Chinese people and the illegal resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly, and severely condemn it. The Chinese people believe that the U.S. government and the United Nations General Assembly's despicable practices are placing new obstacles on the road of the world's people striving for lasting peace and are a manifestation of obstructing the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The countries that supported the absurd U.S. proposal this time should bear serious responsibility for the consequences of this action. The Chinese people are determined to unite with all peace-loving and justice-upholding people around the world to launch a resolute struggle against all conspiracies to turn the United Nations into a tool for implementing U.S. war policies and covering up U.S. aggression and atrocities, and to strive to bring the United Nations back to the road prescribed by the United Nations Charter. We firmly believe that as long as the peace-loving people of the world unite and wage a resolute struggle against these international reactionary forces, peace will surely prevail, and all the conspiracies of the U.S. reactionary group are bound to be shamefully defeated.

### 谴责联合国大会的诽谤行动！

    谴责联合国大会的诽谤行动！
    美国政府以它所捏造的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军“暴行”的谎言为藉口，竟挟持联合国大会通过了它提出的诬蔑朝中人民部队的所谓“五国提案”，作为美国继续保持国际紧张局势的工具。这是一切爱好和平、维护正义的人民所不能容忍的。对此，我国周恩来外长代表我国中央人民政府，于六日发表声明，提出严厉的谴责，认为联合国大会这一决议是非法的，诽谤的，无效的，并号召全国人民和世界一切爱好和平的人民提高警惕，制止美国政府继续制造国际紧张局势、阻挠召开解决朝鲜问题的政治会议的阴谋。全中国人民对于周外长这一义正辞严的声明，坚决表示拥护。
    周恩来外长在声明中指出：美国政府之所以要在这个举世关心板门店朝鲜停战缔约双方会谈的时候，“利用联合国大会来贩卖它凭空捏造的弥天大谎，就是企图转移世界舆论的注意，保持远东及亚洲局势的紧张，以便于它继续拖延朝鲜政治会议的召开，彻底破坏战俘解释工作的进行，加紧对于东南亚的军事侵略，加速日本的重新武装，扩大亚洲军事基地网的建立，并推动亚洲侵略性军事同盟的组织，从而使其扩军备战的政策得以推行。”我们必须击碎美国政府的这种可耻勾当，不让美国侵略集团达到它淆乱国际视听、煽动战争心理、继续扩军备战的罪恶目的。
    美国政府对朝中人民部队的诬蔑报告，究竟是在什么情况之下捏造出来的呢？据美国“新闻周刊”透露，美国政府为了对朝中人民部队进行这种诬蔑宣传，从一九五○年起就一直在制造这方面的所谓“情报”，洛奇在联合国大会上提出的这个报告“至少已经准备了两年”。最近几个月来，美国“政府的法律、谍报和心理战专家们”，为“拟定这个报告的细节”，曾“绞尽脑汁”。这就证明美国向联合国大会提出的所谓“报告”完全是凭空捏造和蓄意挑衅的。在侵朝战争期间，美国就曾几次发动过这种卑劣的宣传，但每一次都遭到了可耻的失败。在侵朝战争初期，麦克阿瑟为了刺激侵朝美军衰败的士气，已经制造了不少关于朝中方面“虐待”战俘的荒诞无稽的鬼话，当时就为朝中方面在前线大批释放美方战俘的事实所彻底粉碎。一九五一年冬，美国为了制造口实来破坏朝鲜停战谈判，并且为了抑制前线美军普遍的反战情绪，也曾由美国第八军军法处处长汉莱发表所谓朝中人民部队“杀害”战俘的声明。但是，汉莱的无耻声明，立即被世界公众舆论所彻底揭穿，使美国极为狼狈。甚至美军官兵也认为汉莱捏造这种谎言是“不负责任的”。当时李奇微总部见势不妙，不得不承认，汉莱所说朝中部队“杀害”战俘并“没有确凿的证据”；并由魏尔奇上校调查了汉莱发表声明的经过，指出汉莱提出的指责不是以事实为依据的，也不符合实际情况。于是汉莱的声明不攻自破。今年四月间，在朝鲜双方交换伤病战俘的时候，美国战争贩子如诺兰、布里奇斯、维利、肖特之流，又曾对朝中方面发动一次诬蔑性宣传，但是由于朝中方面对伤病战俘给以人道待遇的事实有目共见，无可非难，又使美国的诬蔑性宣传彻底破产了。朝中方面所释放的伤病战俘都受到很好的医药治疗，大都恢复了健康。甚至当时英国“每日镜报”也以“暴行乎？谎言乎？”为题发表社论，指出美国的谎言，是“从事煽动”。因此美国的挑衅宣传再一次偃旗息鼓了。现在美国政府又操纵联合国大会通过它所制造的所谓“五国提案”，这又会有什么结果呢？
    美国政府所捏造的关于朝中人民部队的所谓“暴行材料”，最近在美国参议院举行的什么证人听取会上曾经引起了“罕有的哄堂大笑”。现在美国把这些毫无根据只足以取笑的材料，用联合国的旗帜包裹起来，这显然只能使美国政府在国际道义上更加破产到了不可收拾的地步。现在从美洲到澳洲，从美国的营垒中所发出的消息，也在给美国打嘴巴。美国“新闻周刊”芝加哥办事处报道：“关于公众对于朝鲜暴行的反应，值得注意的事就是：公众没有反应。读者并没有震惊得向报馆打电话探询究竟。”美国“圣路易地球民主党人报”刊登了三张捏造的朝中部队“暴行”的照片，满以为会有一些反应，可是电话连一次也没有响。美国“新闻周刊”说，虽然美国宣传机构“全力在海外进行最大限度的宣传”，可是“这些新闻更不为人所注意”，“报纸最多用一小段的篇幅来刊登这个新闻”。虽然澳大利亚是所谓“五国提案”的国家之一，可是澳大利亚的政府官员也不相信美国捏造的朝中部队“暴行”的谎言。据英国“泰晤士报”报道：澳大利亚外交部长凯西在众议院中声称，“澳大利亚和美军当局所进行的调查已经证明一项在华盛顿公布的声明是不确实的，这个声明说，朝鲜境内共方暴行的受难者中有二十名是澳大利亚战俘。”澳大利亚国防部长菲利普·麦克布莱德也根本不知道有这么一回事。全世界都看到，美国政府就是这样一个扯谎造谣的政府，奸诈欺骗的政府！
    美国政府在它的所谓“五国提案”中，居然不知羞耻地提到一九二九年和一九四九年关于战俘待遇的日内瓦公约和一九四九年关于战时保护平民的日内瓦公约等国际法规。但是，翻开日内瓦公约来看，那一条不被美国在侵朝战争中破坏无遗？美国侵略者残暴不仁地迫害、虐杀和强迫扣留我方被俘人员的血腥事实，集体野蛮屠杀朝鲜平民的疯狂暴行，使用细菌武器、毒气、凝固汽油弹的野兽行为，那一点是符合日内瓦公约的呢？现在暂且不说美军在巨济岛、济州岛、蜂岩岛等地疯狂屠杀我方被俘人员的血腥罪行，这是美国将军杜德、柯尔生已经承认了的；也暂且不提东场里战俘营美方特务惨杀我方被俘人员张子龙、张六泰的暴行，这是全世界人民记忆犹新的。这里只举一个例子，就可以充分地证明美国政府公然提到日内瓦公约是多么悖谬和无耻！美国记者奥斯本在一九五○年八月二十一日出版的美国“时代”杂志上写道：“我得说这是一场特别恐怖的战争。因为我们（美国）要获取胜利，所以就强迫自己的士兵在战场上采取最野蛮的行动和作风。这种野蛮，不是在战场上普通的不可避免的野蛮，而是比那还要更残忍更野蛮的。不管那里有没有敌人，见了村庄就整个整个地彻底摧毁；对于难民不分皂白地杀害。和我们（美国）并肩作战的南朝鲜军队，也是同样的野蛮到惨无人道，我亲眼看见南朝鲜警察在押送俘虏回后方时，为了害怕危险而活活将俘虏杀死。在他们从前线溃退下来的时候，他们甚至扫射充塞路途的平民，以便夺路奔命。他们向平民探取我们（美国）所需要的情报时所用的野蛮手段，更是惨不忍述的。”这是美国记者所描述的美国军队的“人道”行为！美国政府现在公然在联合国大会上提出日内瓦公约，只不过是惺惺作态罢了，这是决不能够掩盖它在侵朝战争中所干的血淋淋的罪行的。
    联合国大会应该谴责的正该是美国的这许多滔天罪行。然而，联合国对于美国杀人犯在朝鲜的强盗行为，不仅从未加以谴责，反而一贯纵容美国对朝中方面滥肆诬蔑。早在一九五○年，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府即曾多次向联合国提出抗议，要求安全理事会采取行动来制止美国军队在朝鲜的暴行，但是联合国却充耳不闻。在三年多的朝鲜战争期间，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和中华人民共和国政府虽一再提出抗议，许多国际组织虽不断发出呼吁，要求维护日内瓦公约和海牙公约，但联合国始终一声不响，听任美国军队在朝鲜的暴行变本加厉。如果联合国还有意维护和平事业，那末，它对于美国侵略者在朝鲜的这些罄竹难书的血腥暴行，便早就应该予以严厉的谴责和制止。可是联合国一直没有这样作，放弃了自己的职责。相反的，现在联合国大会竟在没有朝中方面参加的情况下，不顾全世界爱好和平人民和公正舆论的反对，不顾苏联和人民民主国家的正义主张，不顾绝大多数亚洲—阿拉伯国家的不同意见，公然听任美国对朝中方面肆行诽谤，并根据美国政府捏造的所谓朝中人民部队“暴行”的谎言，通过了美国胁迫英国、法国、澳大利亚、土耳其联名提出的诬蔑朝中人民部队的所谓“五国提案”，来帮助美国掩盖在侵朝战争中的罪恶，这不仅是极端卑劣的作法，而且彻底蹂躏了联合国的旗帜，又一次证明了联合国仍然甘心堕落为美国“冷战”政策的工具，这样就使得联合国宪章维护正义的精神荡然无存，联合国在道义上声名扫地。
    中国人民对于美国政府诬蔑朝中人民的无耻勾当，和联合国大会所通过的非法决议，表示无限的愤慨，并加以严厉的谴责。中国人民认为美国政府和联合国大会这种卑劣的作法，是在世界人民争取持久和平的道路上安置的新的障碍，是阻挠朝鲜问题和平解决的表现。这次赞成美国荒谬提案的国家，都应对这种行动的后果担负严重的责任。中国人民决心和全世界爱好和平主张正义的人民一道，展开坚决的斗争，反对把联合国变为执行美国战争政策和掩盖美国侵略暴行的工具的一切阴谋，并努力争取联合国真正回到联合国宪章所规定的道路上来。我们深信，只要世界和平人民团结起来，和这些国际反动势力进行坚决的斗争，和平是一定会胜利的，美国反动集团的一切阴谋都是必然要遭到可耻的失败的。
