Lin Feng, First Deputy Secretary of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Chairman of the Northeast Administrative Committee, said at the inauguration ceremony of the three major projects of Anshan Iron and Steel Company (Angang): "In the past few years, under the leadership of the Party, all employees of Angang have achieved significant accomplishments in the great cause of building Angang and realizing the socialist industrialization of our country. These three important projects of Angang are large-scale and technically complex. During the construction process, many difficulties were encountered. Thanks to the high level of labor enthusiasm and creativity displayed by all employees, along with the working class's strong and unyielding will, the active support of the people of the whole country, and the enthusiastic assistance of Soviet experts, we humbly learned, worked diligently, overcame all difficulties, and completed the very arduous tasks in just over a year. The quality of the projects reached the designed standards, and we accumulated much valuable experience during the construction process. This once again proves that the Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, relying on the wisdom and creative labor of the working class, and with the help of the Soviet government and the Soviet people, will certainly be able to gradually build our country into a strong socialist industrial power." He said, "In the restoration and construction of Angang, the Soviet government supplied the needs of Angang's construction with a complete set of modern equipment. Without this assistance, it would not have been possible for us to build such a modern enterprise in a short period of time. Soviet experts have made outstanding contributions to the restoration and construction of Angang with all their wisdom and strength. The lofty internationalist spirit and excellent work style of the Soviet experts will always be a model for all our employees to learn from. Angang has many Soviet experts and has more favorable conditions for learning from the Soviet Union than other enterprises. We should strive to make Angang a model enterprise for the entire Northeast."

Lin Feng concluded by saying: "Chairman Mao instructed us that the general line of the state during the transition period is the lighthouse illuminating all our work. The cadres and workers of Angang must study the general line well, constantly improve their political awareness, clarify the important responsibilities they bear, actively promote the working class's fine traditions of modesty, perseverance, and hard work, and strive to realize the socialist industrialization of our country."

    林枫在三大工程开工生产典礼上讲话摘要
    中共中央东北局第一副书记、东北行政委员会副主席林枫在鞍钢三大工程开工典礼上讲话，他说：“几年来鞍钢全体职工在党的领导下，在建设鞍钢和实现我们国家社会主义工业化的伟大事业中获得重大成就，鞍钢这三项重要工程，规模宏大，技术复杂，在建设过程中曾遇到很多困难，由于全体职工发挥了高度劳动积极性和创造性，以工人阶级坚强不屈的毅力，在全国人民积极支援和苏联专家的热情帮助下，虚心学习，勤苦钻研、克服了一切困难，仅仅在一年多的时间内，完成了十分艰巨的任务。工程质量达到了设计的标准，并在建设过程中积累了许多宝贵的经验。这就再一次证明了：中国人民在毛主席、共产党的领导下，依靠着工人阶级的智慧和创造性劳动，加上苏联政府和苏联人民的帮助，就一定能够把我们的国家逐步建设成为强大社会主义工业国。”他说：“在鞍钢的恢复和建设工作中，苏联政府以整套的现代化的设备，供应了鞍钢建设的需要。没有这种帮助，我们要在短时期内建设这样的近代化企业是不可能的。苏联专家同志们以他们全部的智慧和力量，对鞍钢的恢复和建设作出了卓越的贡献。苏联专家的崇高的国际主义精神和优良的工作作风，永远是我们全体职工学习的榜样。鞍钢有着许多苏联专家，在学习苏联方面比别的企业有着更优越的条件，应当争取使鞍钢成为全东北的模范企业。
    林枫最后说：“毛主席指示我们，国家在过渡时期的总路线是照耀一切工作的灯塔，鞍钢的干部和职工，要很好的学习总路线，不断地提高政治觉悟，明确自己所担负的重大责任，积极发扬工人阶级谦虚、坚韧和艰苦奋斗的优良传统，为实现我国社会主义的工业化而奋斗。”（新华社）
