Recently, all parts of the country have followed the instructions of the Central Committee and extensively launched study and propaganda concerning the general line and general tasks of the country during the transition period. In order to mobilize all cadres and party members to study and carry out propaganda activities among the broad masses, party committees at all levels have mostly made some communication, instructions, and arrangements one after another, and some have specifically arranged their work in accordance with the spirit of the general line. Now, a heat wave of studying the general line has gradually been set off across the country, and large-scale propaganda work on the general line is being launched. For example, the broad masses of workers and staff in Beijing successively began studying the general line in mid-November. By November 28, more than 350,000 workers and staff had heard reports on the general line, and most of the workers and staff had conducted discussions; faculty, students, and staff of various universities and colleges are also carrying out this study. As of November 26, the number of cadres and masses in Shanghai who had heard reports on the general line or propaganda speeches reached 1.6 million. In the vast rural areas across the country, many places have also begun to vigorously promote the general line and strengthen the political and ideological education of farmers. There is no doubt that this study and propaganda work will become increasingly widespread and in-depth in the future.

Comrade Mao Zedong instructed us that the general line of our country during the transition period is the lighthouse illuminating all our work. Our various specific policies and specific tasks cannot be separated from it. Over the past four years, the reason why our major tasks have achieved continuous victories is that every single one of them has been achieved in accordance with the Party's general line and relying on the strength of the working people. The current progress of our various tasks is also advancing along the track of the general line. Therefore, in order to avoid losing our way in our work and to grasp the correct goals of struggle, in order to correctly implement various policies and do various specific tasks well so as to lead the broad masses forward, we must conscientiously study the general line, and we must take the general line as the pointer of our various tasks. Otherwise, if we do not understand the country's general line, if we separate our specific work from the general line, and become an office worker who blindly and mechanically executes the instructions of the higher authorities, or if we engage in another set of regulations and practices that do not conform to the general line, then right-leaning or "left"-leaning errors will inevitably occur. Such examples have occurred in the past. Therefore, at the beginning of this study, every one of our comrades must understand the importance and urgent practical significance of this study, so as to consciously and conscientiously study, in order to recognize the great future of our country and the specific steps to achieve this goal, and to implement it in our thinking and practical work. Only in this way can we reduce blindness, increase foresight and planning, and make fewer or no mistakes in our work. Only in this way can we guarantee the complete realization of the country's general line.

In his "Summary Report on the Work of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)" at the Eighteenth Party Congress, Comrade Stalin pointed out: "The cadres of the Party are the commanding personnel of the Party, and because our Party is the ruling party, they are also the commanding personnel of the state leadership organs. After the correct political line, tested in practice, is prescribed, the cadres of the Party become the decisive force in Party leadership and state leadership. Having a correct political line is, of course, the primary and most important thing. But that is not enough. The correct political line is not to be used to decorate the facade, but to realize it. In order to realize the correct political line, it requires cadres, it requires people who understand the Party's political line, accept it as their own line, are determined to realize it, are good at practically realizing it, can be responsible for it, can protect it, and can fight for it. Without this condition, the correct political line will inevitably become empty words on paper." "If we can ideologically cultivate the cadre personnel in all our work departments to such an extent, and politically temper them to such an extent, that they can recognize the domestic environment and the international environment at any time, if we can cultivate them into very mature Marxists-Leninists so that they can solve the problems of national leadership without making any serious mistakes, then we have every reason to believe that nine-tenths of all our problems have been solved." Comrade Mao Zedong taught us in his speech at the Jin-Sui Cadre Conference in April 1948: "And if we truly forget the general line and general policies of our Party, we will be blind, incomplete, and unclear revolutionaries, and we will lose our way in the execution of specific work lines and specific policies, we will swing left and right, and we will delay our work." From this, we can know how important it is to study the general line.

Since studying the general line is so important, how should we conduct the study? In addition to requiring the comrades participating in this study to consciously and honestly strive to study, this requires party committees and administrative responsible comrades at all levels to earnestly and responsibly vigorously lead this study movement. Based on past experience, in order for cadre study to be carried out well, the important issue lies in the importance and strengthened leadership of party committees and administrative responsible comrades. Now, in the leadership cadre study in various places, certain achievements and experience have been obtained in organizational leadership, and the established learning organizations and learning systems are gradually becoming sound, learning time and learning classes have been reasonably adjusted, and many cadres have initially cultivated an interest in learning. However, in terms of learning guidance, it is still in a very weak state. How to strengthen learning guidance is the main aspect that should be strived for at present and will be for a long time. Therefore, in the study of the general line, it is a very important task for party committees at all levels to strengthen the work of learning guidance on the basis of not relaxing organizational leadership.

Strengthening the guidance of this study lies first of all in the fact that party committees at all levels can earnestly convey and explain the general line, then prescribe some necessary documents to help everyone repeatedly read and study, and organize some relevant special reports to guide everyone in in-depth study. In the process of studying, attention should be paid to inspiring everyone to think freely, debate freely, and help answer difficult questions in the study and correct learning attitudes as much as possible. As for the requirements of the study content, first of all, everyone should have a comprehensive understanding of the general line, and then conduct key studies. That is to say, we must first make everyone understand that gradually realizing the country's socialist industrialization and gradually realizing the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce are two inseparable aspects of the general line during the transition period. This is the general task that the entire Party and the entire country must strive to achieve in all aspects during the transition period. Only after everyone clearly recognizes the entire content of the general line and the interrelationships between the various components, it is also very necessary for cadres in certain work departments to focus on and specifically study the parts of the general line that are particularly closely related to their work. At the same time, on the basis of understanding the spirit and essence of the general line, we must relate it to work, relate it to thinking, criticize the capitalist ideology and various confused ideas among some party members, draw a clear line between socialist and capitalist ideas, and bring all work into the orbit of the general line. In this way, through this study, we can gradually improve the class consciousness and Marxism-Leninism level of party members and cadres, and do our various tasks well under the illumination of the great lighthouse of the general line.

In the cadre study in the past period, many units have mostly completed the study of Chapter 9 of the "History of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks)", and have had a preliminary understanding of Lenin's and Stalin's theories on the transition period. The general line of our country during the transition period is precisely the application of Lenin's and Stalin's theories on the transition period under the specific conditions of our country. Therefore, if we study the general line on the basis of our past learning achievements, we will improve our theoretical learning by one step, especially in terms of the combination of theory and practice, which will become closer.

The study of the general line cannot be carried out in isolation, but must be combined with propaganda to the masses. Every party member and every cadre should not only study hard by themselves, but also carry out extensive propaganda to the people. In all industrial and mining enterprises, in the vast rural areas, in general schools and hospitals, in industrial and commercial circles, and among urban residents, we must launch large-scale propaganda and education work on the general line to make it known to every household and everyone possible. In industrial and mining enterprises, we must clearly explain the country's general line and general tasks and the great significance of the country's socialist industrialization to the workers, which can greatly improve the workers' class consciousness, enthusiasm, and creativity, and vigorously promote the development and deepening of the production increase and economy practice movement. In the vast rural areas, we must vigorously promote the general line, clearly explain the benefits of national industrialization and agricultural collectivization to the peasants, and improve the peasants' political consciousness and patriotic enthusiasm, which can vigorously promote the current grain purchase work and carry out mutual aid and cooperation movement, and gradually realize the country's socialist transformation of agriculture. In industrial and commercial circles, we must also clearly explain the general line and the truth that the state capitalist economy is superior to the general private capitalist economy, hoping that they can recognize the future of the country and the path they should take, love the country and abide by the law, and welcome the state to carry out socialist transformation of them.

Recent experiences in various places have proven that many cadres, party members, and the masses are all elated and express their sincere support after initially studying and hearing about the propaganda on the general line. They generally reflect that "the horizons have been broadened," "the mind is clear," "confidence has been strengthened," and "the enthusiasm for work is even greater." As a result, the efficiency of many government offices has been improved, the production of many industrial and mining enterprises has developed, farmers have enthusiastically sold grain to the state, and many industrialists and businessmen have expressed their willingness to merge their enterprises with the state through joint state-private operation. For example, Gao Shouheng, a labor model at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, said: "The general line during the transition period is our guiding lighthouse. I must find more tricks, tap potential, and train skilled workers so that our industry can rapidly move towards automation and mechanization." For another example, after hearing about the propaganda on the general line, Rao Shunquan, a member of the Rao Jindong Mutual Aid Group in Bili Township, Luoyuan County, Fujian Province, said: "When the country is industrialized, it can manufacture a large number of new agricultural tools and fertilizers for agricultural use, and agricultural production can be done better." He Yuchun, a member of the group, said: "The more state factories are established, the greater the need for grain. We peasants must work hard to increase grain production to supply the state's needs." Then, they prepared to sell all the group's surplus grain of more than 2,500 kilograms, except for food and use, to the state. Such vivid examples are too numerous to mention. All of this fully proves that once the country's general line is understood and accepted by the broad masses, it will generate endless material strength. And only in this way can the Party's general line and general tasks be truly implemented and realized.

The study and propaganda of the general line is related to all aspects of the country's work and future, and is related to the thinking and actions of every person in the country. Moreover, the scale of this study and propaganda is extremely large, and the significance is extremely important. Therefore, we once again emphasize here that party committees at all levels should attach great importance to and strengthen leadership in this study and propaganda work. This is the center of the Party's ideological and political work in recent months. We want to make the study of the general line a driving force for promoting all work. Of course, the study and propaganda of the general line is a long-term task; however, for the urgent needs of current work, it is absolutely necessary for us to concentrate our efforts on conducting a short-term study and propaganda. Although in the short-term study and propaganda, we cannot solve all the problems of cadres and the masses, which still needs to be gradually solved in future study and work; but we can always greatly improve the socialist consciousness of cadres, party members and the masses through this study and propaganda, and greatly improve our various tasks. At the same time, we should pay attention to summarizing the experience of this study and propaganda, and promptly promote successful experience to create more favorable conditions for future study and work.

    认真地学习和宣传党在过渡时期的总路线
    沙英
    最近，全国各地都遵照中央的指示，广泛地展开了关于国家在过渡时期的总路线和总任务的学习和宣传。为了动员全体干部、党员进行学习并向广大人民群众展开宣传活动，各级党委大都已先后作了一些传达、指示和布置，并且有的已经根据总路线的精神具体安排了自己的工作。现在全国各地已逐步掀起了学习总路线的热潮，并大规模地展开总路线的宣传工作。例如北京市的广大职工群众在十一月中旬先后开始总路线的学习，到十一月二十八日为止，已有三十五万多职工听到关于总路线的传达报告，大部分职工并进行了讨论；各高等学校师生员工也正进行这一学习。上海市到十一月二十六日止，全市听过关于总路线的传达报告或宣传讲话的干部和群众，已达一百六十万人。在全国广大农村中，许多地方也开始大张旗鼓地宣传总路线，加强对农民的政治思想教育工作。毫无疑问的，今后这一学习和宣传工作，势将日益广泛和深入。
    毛泽东同志指示我们说，我们国家在过渡时期的总路线是照耀我们各项工作的灯塔。我们各种具体政策和具体工作都不能离开它。过去四年来，我们各项主要工作所以能取得不断的胜利，没有一件不是依照党的总路线、依靠劳动人民的力量而取得的。目前我们各种工作的进行，也正是循着总路线的轨道前进的。因此，为了在工作中不致迷失方向而能掌握正确的奋斗目标，为了正确地执行各种政策和做好各种具体工作，以带领广大群众前进，都必须认真地学习总路线，都必须以总路线作为我们各种工作的指针。否则，如果不了解国家的总路线，使自己的具体工作离开了总路线，变成一个盲目地、机械地执行上级指示的事务主义者，或者另搞一套不合乎总路线的规定和做法，这便必然要发生右倾或“左”倾的错误。过去这种例子并不是没有的。所以在这学习开始的时候，我们每一个同志都要了解这一学习的重要性和迫切的实践意义，从而自觉地认真地学习，以便认清我们国家的伟大的将来以及实现这个目标的具体步骤，并把它贯彻到自己的思想和实际工作中去。这样才能减少盲目性，增加预见性和计划性，使工作不犯错误或少犯错误。这样才能保证国家总路线的完全实现。
    斯大林同志“在第十八次党代表大会上关于联共（布）中央工作的总结报告”中指出：“党底干部是党的指挥人员，并且因为我们党是执政的党，所以他们也就是国家领导机关底指挥人员。在实践中考验过了的正确的政治路线规定后，党底干部就成为党领导和国家领导方面的决定力量。具有正确的政治路线，当然是首要的和最重要的事情。但是这还不够。正确的政治路线并不是用来装饰门面，而是要实现起来的。为了实现正确政治路线，就需要有干部，就需要有懂得党底政治路线，把它当作自己的路线来接受，决意把它实现起来，善于切实把它实现起来，能够对它负责，能够保护它，能够为它而奋斗的人材。没有这个条件，正确的政治路线就不免要化为纸上空文了。”“如果我们能把我们所有各工作部门中的干部人员在思想上造就到这样的程度，在政治上把他们锻炼到这样的程度，使得他们能够随时认清国内环境和国际环境，如果我们能把他们造成为十分成熟的马列主义者，使得他们能够解决国家领导问题而不犯什么严重错误，那么我们就有一切根据，认为我们所有问题十分之九都已经解决了。”毛泽东同志一九四八年四月在晋绥干部会议上的讲话中这样教导我们：“而如果真正忘记了我党的总路线和总政策，我们就将是一个盲目的不完全的不清醒的革命者，在我们执行具体工作路线和具体政策的时候，就会迷失方向，就会发生左右摇摆，就会遗误我们的工作。”从此，我们便可以知道学习总路线具有如何的重大意义了。
    既然学习总路线如此重要，那么我们应当怎样进行学习呢？这除了要求参加这一学习的同志都自觉地、老老实实地努力学习之外，这就要要求各级党委和行政负责同志认真负责地大力领导这一学习运动。根据过去的经验，干部学习要很好地开展起来，重要的问题在于党委和行政负责同志的重视和加强领导。现在各地领导干部学习，在组织领导方面，大都已经获得了一定的成绩和经验，建立起来的学习组织和学习制度逐步趋向健全，学习时间和学习编级进行了合理的调整，许多干部已初步培养起学习的兴趣。可是在学习指导方面，还是处于一种十分薄弱的状态。如何加强学习指导，乃是目前并将是长期内应当努力的主要方面。因此，在总路线的学习中，各级党委在不放松组织领导的基础上加强学习指导工作，便是一个很重要的任务。
    加强这一学习的指导工作，首先在于各级党委能对总路线进行认真地传达和讲解，然后规定若干必要的文件，帮助大家反复地阅读和研究，并要组织一些有关的专题报告，引导大家进行深入地学习。在学习过程中，要注意启发大家自由地思考、自由地辩论，并尽可能帮助解答学习中的疑难问题和端正学习态度。至于对学习内容的要求，首先要使大家对总路线作一个全面的认识，然后再作重点的学习。这就是说必须首先使大家了解：逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化和逐步实现对农业、对手工业和对私营工商业的社会主义改造，是过渡时期的总路线的不可分离的两个方面。这是全党全国在过渡时期在各个方面必须努力以赴的总任务。只有在大家明确认识了总路线的全部内容以及各个组成部分之间的相互关系之后，某些工作部门中的干部，把总路线中与他们工作关系特别密切的部分作为重点，着重地具体地研究一下，那也是很必要的。同时，在领会总路线的精神和实质的基础上，要联系工作，联系思想，批判某些党员中的资本主义思想和各种糊涂观念，划清社会主义和资本主义的思想界限，把全部工作纳入总路线的轨道。这样，便能通过这一学习，逐步提高党员、干部的阶级觉悟和马克思列宁主义水平，并在总路线这座伟大的灯塔的照耀下做好我们的各项工作。
    在过去一个时期的干部学习中，很多单位大都已学完“联共（布）党史”第九章，对列宁、斯大林关于过渡时期的理论已经有了初步的体会，而我国在过渡时期的总路线，正是列宁、斯大林关于过渡时期的理论在我国具体条件下的运用。因此，我们在过去学习成果的基础上来学习总路线，就会使我们的理论学习提高一步，特别是在理论联系实际方面，将更加密切起来。
    总路线的学习，不能孤立进行，必须和对群众的宣传结合起来。每一个党员、每一个干部除了自己认真学好之外，还应该对人民群众进行广泛的宣传。在所有工矿企业中，在广大农村中，在一般学校、医院中，在工商业界和城市居民中，我们都要大规模地展开关于总路线的宣传教育工作，尽可能做到家喻户晓，人人皆知。在工矿企业中，我们要把国家的总路线和总任务，把国家社会主义的工业化的伟大意义给工人讲清楚，这就能大大提高工人阶级的觉悟性、积极性和创造性，有力地推动增产节约运动的开展和深入。在广大的农村中，我们要大张旗鼓地宣传总路线，把国家工业化和农业合作化对农民的好处讲清楚，提高农民的政治觉悟和爱国热情，这就能有力地推动目前的购粮工作和开展互助合作运动，逐步实现国家对农业的社会主义改造。在工商业界，我们也要把总路线、把国家资本主义经济优越于一般私人资本主义经济的道理讲清楚，希望他们能认识到国家的前途和自己应走的道路，要爱国守法，要欢迎国家对他们进行社会主义的改造。
    最近各地的经验证明，许多干部、党员和群众，在初步学习了和听到了关于总路线的宣传之后，无不欢欣鼓舞，表示衷心地拥护。他们普遍反映：“眼界扩大了”，“心里豁亮了”，“信心加强了”，“工作劲头更足了”。因而，许多机关工作的效率提高了，许多工矿企业的生产发展了，农民们踊跃地把粮食卖给国家，不少工商业者表示愿意将自己的企业和国家公私合营。例如：石景山钢铁厂的劳动模范高寿恒说：“过渡时期的总路线是我们的指路灯塔，我一定要多找窍门、挖潜力，培养技术工人，使我们的工业迅速地走向自动化、机械化。”再如福建省罗源县碧里乡饶金栋互助组的组员们在听到关于总路线的宣传后，组员饶顺泉说：“国家工业化了，才能制造大批的新式农具和肥料供给农业使用，农业生产才能搞得更好。”组员何裕春说：“国家工厂办得越多，粮食的需要也就越多，我们农民就得努力增产粮食，供给国家需要。”接着便准备把全组除吃用以外的全部余粮二千五百多斤卖给国家。像这类生动的事例，那是举不胜举的。这都充分地证明了：国家的总路线一旦为广大群众所理解、所接受的时候，便会产生无穷无尽的物质力量。而且只有如此，党的总路线和总任务才能真正得到贯彻与实现。
    关于总路线的学习和宣传，是关系国家各个方面的工作和前途，是关系全国每一个人的思想和行动；而且这一次学习和宣传的规模极为广大，意义极关重要，因此，这里我们再一次强调，各级党委应该非常重视和加强领导这一学习和宣传工作。这是最近数月内党的思想政治工作的中心。我们要使总路线的学习成为推进一切工作的动力。当然，关于总路线的学习和宣传是一个长时期的工作；可是为了目前工作的迫切需要，我们集中力量进行一个短时期的学习和宣传，却是完全必要的。虽然在短期的学习和宣传中，我们不可能解决干部和群众中的所有问题，这还有待于在今后的学习和工作中逐步地加以解决；但我们总可以通过这次学习和宣传，把干部、党员和群众的社会主义觉悟大大地提高一步，把我们的各项工作大大地提高一步。同时我们要注意总结这次学习和宣传的经验，及时推广成功的经验，给今后的学习和工作创造更有利的条件。
