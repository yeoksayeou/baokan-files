    Old Plans and New Plans
    Gao Changren
    This summer, a peddler from Gongjiaqiao Township, Wuchang County, Hubei, brought back news from Wuhan: the price of mung beans in Wuchang was very good; one could earn 1,000 yuan per jin by carrying them from the countryside to Wuchang. This news moved Huang Xufu, a young farmer from Huangjia Old House in the township.

    After Huang Xufu was allocated land in the land reform of 1951, he joined a temporary mutual aid group in 1952. However, due to the poor foundation of his family, life was not easy. He wanted to get rid of poverty as soon as possible and often pondered how to "get rich" quickly. When he heard the news that "mung beans were priced well in Wuchang," he was very happy and thought, "The rice seedlings have already been planted, so I can take a few days to make a trip to Wuchang." He bought 50 jin of mung beans in his village at 1,400 yuan per jin, carried them on a pole, and went to Wuchang.

    At that time, the state-owned grain company in Wuhan did not have control of mung beans, and the grain merchants raised the price of mung beans to 2,400 yuan per jin. Huang Xufu earned 50,000 yuan in his first small business transaction. Seeing that others bought some goods to take back from Wuchang, he spent 87,000 yuan to buy 30 old flour sacks to bring back. The purchase price was 2,900 yuan per sack, and he sold them for 4,000 yuan each when he returned. All in all, he earned 83,000 yuan.

    Having received "benefits" from his initial business venture, Huang Xufu secretly thought, "This 'side job' is really good and promising." He wanted to expand this "side job," so he invited Huang Deqing to join him in selling mung beans. The two of them sold a total of 250 jin. They also brought back 50 old flour sacks, and they all made money. As a result, their interest in doing business grew stronger and stronger.

    However, when they transported 200 jin of mung beans for the third time to sell to private merchants, not only did they not make money, but they also lost a lot of money. It turned out that some illegal grain merchants in Wuchang, taking advantage of the state-owned grain company's lack of control over mung beans, first used a high price of 2,400 yuan per jin to lure farmers and peddlers to transport large quantities of mung beans to Wuchang. Once the supply was plentiful, they ruthlessly reduced the price to 1,200 yuan per jin. The farmers and peddlers could not transport the mung beans back and were forced to sell them to private merchants at a loss. Although this business trip was a loss, Huang Xufu himself transported another 40 jin of soybeans to Wuchang, hoping to make up for his losses on soybeans, but he still did not make any money. He and Huang Deqing transported goods back and forth for a month, and when they finally calculated the accounts, they found that they had each lost one shi of rice.

    During this month, there was a long drought, and all the farmers in the village were pumping water to fight the drought. Although Huang Xufu was in the mutual aid group, he was busy doing business, and as a result, more than one mu of his field was not watered in time, and the seedlings withered. By the time he came back and wanted to pump water to save them, the water in the pond had also dried up, and he could only watch the seedlings wither. As a result, he harvested more than three shi of rice less in the autumn. The mutual aid group was also dissatisfied with him for neglecting agriculture and only engaging in "side jobs."

    His fields were neglected, and he lost money. But Huang Xufu was not discouraged. At this time, farmers Huang Zushu and Huang Maorong from the same village saw that some people were making a lot of money by butchering pigs and selling meat, and they also wanted to open a butcher shop, but they did not have enough capital. One day, they learned that Huang Xufu had sold 400,000 yuan worth of rice and was preparing to repay the bank loan. The two of them were overjoyed and invited Huang Xufu to join them in opening a butcher shop. The three people who wanted to get rich hit it off and came up with a business plan. They planned to raise 1 million yuan of capital together. Huang Zushu would butcher the pigs, Huang Maorong would help, and Huang Xufu would keep the accounts, opening a butcher shop in the village. They would start with "deferred butchering" (i.e., butchering pigs on credit first, then paying later) and gradually expand. Huang Zushu and Huang Maorong also came up with an idea: they would only report the tax for one pig for every two pigs they slaughtered, since the tax office could not come down to inspect every day. They planned that after the business expanded, they would move to Zhifang Town to open a large butcher shop. Huang Xufu also secretly planned to sell his farmland at that time and move his whole family to Zhifang to live.

    On November 9th, Huang Xufu attended a meeting of cadres and activists convened by Gongjiaqiao Township. Before the meeting, Huang Zushu and Huang Maorong had agreed with him that as soon as the meeting was over, they would come back to prepare for the opening of the butcher shop. Huang Xufu thought, "This meeting is probably about merging townships or holding general elections." He also hoped that the meeting would end soon so that he could come back to do business.

    However, this meeting was to study the general line and general tasks of the state during the transition period. Others were discussing enthusiastically, but he did not say a word.

    When the two roads for peasants were discussed, Huang Xufu began to feel uneasy. At the meeting, everyone said that private merchants should be utilized, restricted, and transformed. Many examples of grain merchants' speculation and profiteering that harmed people's lives were exposed, and it was advocated to actively organize agricultural production cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives, and credit cooperatives.

    At this time, Huang Xufu also thought: doing business myself does involve exploitation. Buying beans in the village and selling them in Wuchang, I made 1,000 yuan per jin in one transaction, and I even lied to others that I didn't make any money. If I butcher pigs and sell meat, the exploitation would be even worse. Wouldn't that make me a businessman? What kind of "side job" would that be? Thinking, thinking, but then he thought of someone in his township who had made tens of millions of yuan by opening a butcher shop and getting rich very quickly. If I could open a butcher shop, even if I didn't make a lot of money, it would be nice to eat some meat and use the pig slaughtering water to fertilize the fields. The bad idea of personal enrichment held him back again.

    Then, at the meeting, others continued to expose many ugly tricks of grain merchants' speculation and exploitation, which prompted Huang Xufu to recall his own losses and losses in business. He saw through the grain merchants' tricks of raising prices first and then cutting prices. From this, he came to a conclusion: "Big merchants exploit small peddlers, and small peddlers exploit peasants." When everyone discussed developing supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives to reduce private merchants' exploitation and guide peasants to take the road of common prosperity, he further realized that there was no future in taking the capitalist road. He was a member of the Youth League, the head of the militia squad, and had never lagged behind since the land reform. Now that he realized that capitalism was a dead end, why didn't he turn back? Thinking of this, he became more clear. But what completely cleared his mind was that he remembered his past exploitation: his father died when he was eleven years old. After that, he herded cattle for landlords and was always exploited and bullied. He had finally survived those hard days. Now that he had just turned over, he unknowingly wanted to exploit others. Wouldn't that be like in the past, when a few people got rich and most people suffered? Thinking of this, he gave up the idea of butchering pigs and selling meat and strengthened his confidence in taking the socialist road to common prosperity. His ideological struggle finally triumphed. At the discussion meeting on the third day, he told everyone about his ideological struggle from beginning to end. Everyone helped him analyze it, and it was capitalist ideology. Only by overcoming this kind of thinking could he embark on a new road. In the following days of the meeting, Huang Xufu spoke actively and discussed enthusiastically with everyone how to educate the peasants to take the socialist road and sell grain to the state when he returned.

    After Huang Xufu returned home from the meeting, Huang Zushu came to him enthusiastically to discuss the opening of the butcher shop. Huang Zushu said, "I sold a calf and have 500,000 yuan at home. When will our business open?" Huang Xufu said coldly to him, "That idea is not good. It's the capitalist road, and there's no future! I'm not going to do it." Then, he told them in detail about the national industrialization, the two roads for peasants, and other principles. Finally, with the help of Huang Xufu, Huang Zushu and Huang Maorong also became enlightened. They also expressed their firm determination to get rich through labor and to prosper through production. They believed that in the future, if they were to engage in side occupations, they should engage in legitimate side occupations, and they would never engage in speculative business again.

    The old plan was wrong. Huang Xufu was determined to take a new road. How should he go? He had a personal plan: first, to respond to the state's call, to be meticulous and frugal, and to save grain. To sell the surplus five shi of rice to the state. Second, he was determined to improve the mutual aid group. The original mutual aid group collapsed in the autumn because it did not adhere to the principle of mutual benefit. Now he had re-connected with four farmers to organize it, and everyone elected him as the leader. He was determined to improve the mutual benefit system within the group. They had already helped each other during the harvest of late autumn crops. In the winter, they would also open up a batch of cooked wasteland and try to accumulate more fertilizer in order to strive for a greater harvest next year. Third, during the slack season, they would organize labor to go to the Guanshan quarry construction site to break stones, engaging in legitimate side occupations through labor.

    Now, Gongjiaqiao Township is launching a mass movement to study the general line and sell surplus grain to the state. Huang Xufu produces during the day and unites a group of activists from Huangjia Old House to study the work situation and discuss working methods in the evening. At many meetings, he reported his own ideological transformation process to everyone. He often said to people, "Our task as peasants is to do a good job in production, produce more grain, and support national construction. The idea of capitalist personal enrichment is unacceptable. Only by taking the road of collectivization can we reach socialism and everyone can live a good life."

    旧打算和新计划
    高长任
    今年夏天，湖北武昌县龚家桥乡有个小贩，从武汉带回来一个消息：武昌的绿豆价钱很好，从乡下挑到武昌，一斤绿豆能赚一千元。这个消息打动了该乡黄家老屋的青年农民黄绪富的心。
    黄绪富在一九五一年土地改革中分到土地后，一九五二年参加了临时互助组。但家中底子太差，生活过得并不宽裕。他想早点摆脱贫困生活，时常盘算如何才能很快地“发家致富”。他听到“武昌绿豆价钱好”的消息时，非常高兴，就想：“秧已插下去，抽出几天功夫，到武昌跑一趟。”他在本村以每斤一千四百元收买了五十斤绿豆，挑个担子就到武昌去了。
    当时武汉市国营粮食公司没有掌握绿豆，粮商把绿豆价格提高到每斤二千四百元。黄绪富在第一趟小生意中，就赚了五万元。他看别人从武昌回来都买些回头货，也就拿出八万七千元买了三十条旧面粉袋子带回来。买价是二千九百元一条，回来每条卖四千元。一来一去，共赚了八万三千元。
    初次做生意得到了“好处”，黄绪富暗地想着：这个“副业”真不错，有做头。他想把这个“副业”扩大，回来便邀了黄德清合伙贩绿豆。两人共贩了二百五十斤。回来又带回五十条旧面粉袋子，都赚了钱。于是他们对于做生意的兴趣就越来越高了。
    但是，当他们第三次贩运二百斤绿豆去卖给私商时，不但没有赚钱，反而大大地赔了本。原来武昌的某些不法粮商乘着国营粮食公司没有掌握绿豆时，先以二千四百元一斤的高价，引诱农民和小贩把大批绿豆运到武昌，等到货源很多时，就狠心地把价钱杀到每斤一千二百元。农民和小贩不能把绿豆运回去，逼得只好赔本卖给私商。这一趟生意虽然亏本了，但黄绪富一个人又贩四十斤黄豆到武昌，他希望从黄豆上捞本，可是仍然没有赚钱。他和黄德清两个人前前后后贩运了一个月，结果一算账，每人都赔了一石稻谷。
    在这一个月当中，正是久旱不雨，全村农民都在车水抗旱。黄绪富虽然在互助组里，由于忙着做生意，结果，有一亩多田没有及时车水，秧苗发枯了，等他回来想车水抢救时，塘里的水也干了，只好眼看着秧苗干枯。因此秋收时少打三石多稻谷。互助组对他丢了农业，光搞“副业”，也不满意。
    荒了田，赔了钱。但黄绪富还没有死心。这时，同村农民黄祖述、黄茂荣看到有些人杀猪卖肉赚到很多钱，也想开个肉铺子，只是本钱不够。有一天，知道黄绪富卖了四十万元的稻谷，准备还银行的贷款，这两个人喜出望外，就来邀黄绪富合伙开肉铺。三个想发财的人情投意合，就商量出一套经营计划来。他们打算三个人凑成一百万元本钱。黄祖述杀猪，黄茂荣帮忙，黄绪富管账，在村里开个肉铺。先搞“期杀”（即先赊猪来杀，后付款）慢慢再扩大。黄祖述、黄茂荣还出了个主意：杀两口猪，只报一口猪的税，反正税务所不能天天下来检查。他们计划生意扩大以后，就搬到纸坊镇去开个大肉铺。黄绪富还暗暗打算，那时候就把田地卖掉，全家搬到纸坊去住。
    十一月九日，黄绪富参加了龚家桥乡召开的干部、积极分子会议。会前，黄祖述、黄茂荣和他约好，一开完会就回来筹备肉铺开张。黄绪富想：“这次会议大概总是搞并乡或者是普选。”他也盼望早点开完会回来做生意。
    但是，这次会议却是学习国家在过渡时期的总路线和总任务。别人热烈讨论，他却一言不发。
    当讨论到农民的两条道路时，黄绪富开始不安了。会上，大家都说对私商要利用、限制、改造。揭露了许多粮商投机倒把危害人民生活的事例，主张积极组织农业生产合作社、供销合作社和信贷合作社。
    这时，黄绪富也想到：自己做生意，的确有剥削，在乡里买豆子到武昌去卖，一转手一斤就赚了一千元，对别人还瞒着说没赚到钱。如果杀猪卖肉，剥削更厉害，那不成了个商人，还算什么“副业”？想着，想着，但，一转念间他却又想到本乡有人开肉铺赚了上千万元，发财发得真快，自己要是开成了肉铺，先不讲赚钱，就是赚点肉吃吃，落点杀猪水肥田也不错呀。个人发财的坏思想又把他拖住了。
    接着在会上别人继续揭露了很多关于粮商投机剥削的丑恶花样，启发了黄绪富联想起自己做生意吃亏赔本的事情。他看透了粮商先抬价、后杀价的鬼板眼，从这里他得出一个结论：“大商剥削小贩，小贩剥削农民。”当大家讨论到发展供销合作社和信贷合作社，减少私商剥削，引导农民走共同富裕的道路时，他才进一步认识到走资本主义道路没有前途。他是个青年团员，基干民兵班长，土地改革以后一直没有落后过，既然认识到资本主义是一条死路，为什么还不回头呢？想到这里，他更明确起来了。但是彻底打通他的思想的，还是他想起了自己过去受剥削的情形：他十一岁死了父亲，以后帮过地主放牛，一直受人家剥削、欺侮，苦日子好容易熬到头。如今刚刚翻身，又不知不觉地想去剥削别人，那不是又像过去一样让少数人发财，多数人受罪吗？想到这里，他就打消了杀猪卖肉的念头，坚定了走社会主义共同富裕的道路的信心。他的思想斗争终于胜利了。第三天的讨论会上，他把自己思想斗争过程源源本本的谈出来，大家帮助他一分析，那就是资本主义思想。只有克服这种思想才能走上新道路。以后几天的会议，黄绪富积极发言，和大家一起热烈讨论回去如何教育农民走社会主义的道路，把粮食卖给国家。
            ×××
    黄绪富开完会回家以后，黄祖述兴致勃勃地来找他商量开肉铺的事情，黄祖述说：“我卖了一条小牛，五十万元放在家里，我们的生意几时开张？”黄绪富冷淡地对他说：“那个想法要不得，是资本主义道路，没有前途！我是不干了。”接着，他从头到尾把国家工业化、农民的两条道路等道理详细告诉他们。最后，黄祖述、黄茂荣在黄绪富帮助之下，也觉悟过来了。他们也表示坚决要靠劳动发家，生产致富。认为今后搞副业还是要搞正当的副业，再也不做投机生意。
    旧的打算是错误的，黄绪富坚决要走新道路，怎么走呢，他个人有一个计划：首先是响应国家号召，精打细算，节约粮食。把多余的五石稻谷卖给国家。第二，他决心要把互助组搞好。原来的互助组因为没有坚持互利的原则，秋天里垮台了。现在他重新串连了四户农民组织起来，大家选他当组长。他决心把组内的互利制度搞好。收割晚秋作物时，他们已互助了一段，到冬天，还要开一批熟荒，想办法多积肥料，争取明年多打粮食。第三，农闲时候组织劳动力到官山采石工地打石碴，凭劳动搞正当的副业。
    现在，龚家桥乡正展开学习总路线、把余粮卖给国家的群众性运动。黄绪富白天生产，晚上就团结黄家老屋一批积极分子研究工作情况。讨论工作方法。在许多次的会议上，他都将他本身的思想转变过程向大家报告，他常对人说：“我们农民的任务是搞好生产，多打粮食，支援国家建设。资本主义个人发财的思想要不得。只有走合作化的道路，才能到社会主义，大家过好日子。”
