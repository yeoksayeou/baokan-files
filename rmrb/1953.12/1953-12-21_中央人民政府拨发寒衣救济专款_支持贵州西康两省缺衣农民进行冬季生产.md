    The Central People's Government has allocated 9.75 billion yuan in special funds for winter clothing relief to assist impoverished farmers in Guizhou and Xikang provinces who lack adequate clothing to carry out winter production. The funds will primarily address the issue of winter clothing for impoverished farmers in certain areas of these two provinces who have labor capacity but genuinely lack sufficient clothing, thereby impacting their ability to engage in winter production. The funds will also address the winter clothing needs of impoverished families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel, as well as widowed, elderly, weak, disabled, and clothing-deficient individuals.
    After receiving the allocated special funds of 8.25 billion yuan, the Guizhou Provincial People's Government immediately instructed the Department of Civil Affairs, in conjunction with relevant departments, to study and propose specific measures based on the actual conditions in various localities. Following consultations between the Department of Civil Affairs and relevant departments, the number of winter clothing items to be distributed to each special district and the distribution methods have been determined. To meet the actual needs of clothing-deficient individuals in various localities and avoid waste, the Department of Civil Affairs has uniformly purchased approximately 24,865 rolls of various fabrics from the Guizhou Provincial Branch of the China National Cotton, Yarn and Piece Goods Corporation, sufficient to sew approximately 198,920 sets of clothing. These will be distributed to special districts including Bijie, Xingyi, Guiding, Zhenyuan, Zunyi, Duyun, Tongren, and Anshun. Since November 10th, all fabrics have been successively received by each special commissioner's office and distributed to counties, districts, and townships, where township (village) councils will evaluate and distribute them to clothing-deficient individuals for self-tailoring. Simultaneously, the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs has also issued specific measures and sent official letters requiring each special district and county to immediately organize efforts to carry out this work. In general areas, the goal is to distribute the actual goods to clothing-deficient individuals by the end of November, with the latest deadline being December 20th for individual remote areas.
    The winter clothing relief fund allocated to Xikang Province is 1.5 billion yuan. After research by the Provincial People's Government, it was decided to allocate 900 million yuan to the Xichang Special District and 300 million yuan each to the Tibetan and Yi Autonomous Regions. The distribution method will be to produce Tibetan clothing in the Tibetan Autonomous Region and distribute it accordingly. In the Xichang Special District and the Yi Autonomous Region, the principle will be to distribute actual goods such as cotton-padded clothing, cotton vests, sheepskin jackets, and winter clothing fabric. It was also pointed out that the target recipients are families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel and impoverished farmers who are without or lack clothing, overcoming phenomena such as egalitarianism, stockpiling, and blind distribution. In conjunction with the distribution of winter clothing, efforts should be strengthened to educate farmers in patriotism and the worker-peasant alliance, and encourage them to actively engage in production.

    中央人民政府拨发寒衣救济专款
    支持贵州西康两省缺衣农民进行冬季生产
    中央人民政府为了扶助贵州、西康两省贫苦缺衣农民进行冬季生产，拨发寒衣救济专款九十七亿五千万元，重点解决该两省部分地区有劳动力而确实缺衣、足以影响冬季生产的贫苦农民的寒衣问题；解决贫苦缺衣的烈属和军属、以及鳏寡老弱残疾缺衣者的寒衣问题。
    贵州省人民政府奉拨专款八十二亿五千万元后，当即指示民政厅会同有关部门，根据各地实际情况，研究提出具体意见。民政厅与有关部门会商结果，已确定分配各专区寒衣数字和发放办法。为切合各地缺衣者实际需要和避免浪费，发放寒衣所需布料已由民政厅统一向花纱布公司贵州省公司购买各种布料共约二万四千八百六十五匹，计可缝衣十九万八千九百二十套。分配给毕节、兴义、贵定、镇远、遵义、都匀、铜仁、安顺等专区。自十一月十日起所有布料已先后由各专署接收，分配所属各县转发区、乡，由乡（村）评议发放缺衣者自行缝制。与此同时，省民政厅并规定具体办法，发出公函要求各专、县立即组织力量做好这一工作。一般地区要求在十一月底将实物发到缺衣者手中，个别边远地区至迟须在十二月二十日以前发放完毕。
    拨给西康省的寒衣救济款十五亿元。经省人民政府研究后，决定将上项救济款分配给西昌专区九亿元，藏、彝族自治区各三亿元。发放办法，藏族自治区制成藏装后发放，西昌专区及彝族自治区以发放棉衣、棉背心、羊皮褂、寒衣布等实物为原则。并指出发放对象为无衣或缺衣的烈、军属和贫苦农民，克服平均主义、积压及盲目发放等现象，结合发放寒衣，应加强对农民进行爱国主义和工农联盟教育，鼓励农民积极搞好生产。
