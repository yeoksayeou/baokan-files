The economic and technical assistance of the Soviet Union played a decisive role in the construction and rapid commissioning of the three major projects of Anshan Iron and Steel Company in China: the Large Rolling Mill, the Seamless Steel Tube Plant, and the No. 7 Blast Furnace. The smooth commissioning of these three major projects in the first winter of the country's planned construction is of great significance for accelerating China's economic construction.

These three major projects, from surveying and design, the supply of automated machinery and equipment, to construction, installation, technical guidance for production, and personnel training, all received tremendous assistance from the Soviet Union from beginning to end. The design work for the Large Rolling Mill and the Seamless Steel Tube Plant was carried out by the Soviet Union for China. The design work was very extensive. In addition to a large number of preliminary designs and technical designs, the construction drawings for these two projects alone numbered 24,000. If these construction drawings were laid out, their area would be more than 18 mu; if these construction drawings were connected, they would be 24 li long. If calculated according to China's current design capabilities, these construction drawings would take one person 500 years to complete. In 1950, when Anshan Iron and Steel was still undergoing restoration work, the Soviet government began overall design work for large and seamless factories. A large number of the best metallurgical plant design experts from cities such as Moscow, Leningrad, and Sverdlovsk participated in this work. The main equipment for the Large Rolling Mill and Seamless Steel Tube Plant was all manufactured by the Soviet Union for China, and many of the mechanical equipment and all the automation devices for the No. 7 Blast Furnace system were also manufactured by the Soviet Union for China. The number of these mechanical and electrical equipment is staggering. These equipment began to arrive in Anshan in a continuous stream from 1952.

The designs that the Soviet Union made for China's Large Rolling Mill and Seamless Steel Tube Plant, and the orders manufactured for the Large Rolling Mill, Seamless Steel Tube Plant, and No. 7 Blast Furnace system, all adopted the latest Soviet scientific and technological achievements. Some of the equipment had just been designed and manufactured in the Soviet Union. Therefore, these three major projects are also among the best in the world. All three major projects are automated, and their mechanical equipment is entirely electrically operated. For example, an electrical worker in the main electrical room of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant can know the operating conditions of all the motors behind the wall. When a motor overheats, a red light will illuminate. If no one adjusts it at this time, the automatic device will immediately stop supplying power. Another example is that the changes in the blast furnace are very difficult to grasp. The height of the temperature inside the furnace and the speed of the raw materials going down, if not properly controlled, will affect the output and quality of the iron. However, because the No. 7 Blast Furnace has an automatic device, any subtle changes inside or outside the furnace are reflected in the signal room at any time. In this way, the production of the blast furnace can be completely controlled.

The complete set of equipment manufactured by the Soviet Union for China not only demonstrated its superiority in production, but also greatly improved the working conditions of workers. Many machines can be operated by very few people, so labor productivity is much higher than in similar factories in general capitalist countries. Workers are also freed from heavy physical labor. For example, the workers at the No. 7 Blast Furnace no longer need to use a sledgehammer with great effort when opening the tapping hole.

The assistance of the Soviet government and the Soviet people to the three major projects fully embodies the truth stated by Stalin: "The problem is not only that this assistance is extremely cheap and technically first-rate. The problem is primarily that the basis of this cooperation is the sincere desire to help each other and seek common economic advancement." For example, the piercing rod of the piercing machine tailstock and the pneumatic operating devices on the automatic pipe rolling machine and sizing machine of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant had already been shipped to Anshan. Later, because of new scientific achievements, the Soviet Union designed and manufactured equipment with better production efficiency. Therefore, the Soviet Union immediately sent us these new products. In order to rush the production of machinery and electrical equipment for the three major projects, workers in dozens of metallurgical, machinery, electrical, and tool manufacturing plants in major cities such as Moscow, Leningrad, Sverdlovsk, Kharkov, and Kiev launched socialist labor competitions. This autumn, during the most intense days of the final stage of the Anshan Iron and Steel's three major projects, the Seamless Steel Tube Plant needed to install control panels, the Large Rolling Mill needed signal oil gauges, and the No. 7 Blast Furnace and Large Rolling Mill needed compensation wires. The Soviet government specially dispatched a special aircraft to transport these equipment to meet the needs of the project construction in a timely manner. In September and October this year, the Large Rolling Mill needed dozens of tons of transmission ball bearing lubricating oil for trial operation and commissioning. The employees of the oil manufacturing plant in Molotovsk City were very happy when they heard that they were manufacturing a batch of oil for China's Large Rolling Mill. They disregarded disrupting their own production plans and quickly manufactured this batch of oil. The Soviet comrades in railway transportation also broke the general railway transportation practice and added a special car for transporting lubricating oil for Anshan Iron and Steel behind a fast passenger train, so that this batch of lubricating oil arrived at the large construction site in mid-October, just in time to meet the needs of the Large Rolling Mill for trial operation. During the most intense period of the construction of the three major projects of Anshan Iron and Steel, the Soviet government sent experts from Moscow to Anshan several times to help solve the difficult problems in construction; the Soviet government's commercial delegation in China also sent representatives to Anshan many times to study the supply of equipment and materials.

### 苏联对鞍山三大工程的伟大援助

    苏联对鞍山三大工程的伟大援助
    苏联的经济和技术的援助，对于我国鞍山钢铁公司大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂、第七号炼铁炉等三大工程的建设和迅速投入生产，起了决定性的作用。这三大工程在祖国开始有计划建设的第一年冬天就顺利地投入生产，对于加速我国的经济建设有极其重大的意义。
    这三大工程，从勘察设计、自动化机械化设备的供应，到建筑、安装、开工生产的技术指导和人材的培养等方面，从头到尾都得到了苏联的巨大援助。大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂的设计工作是苏联为我国进行的。设计工作非常浩繁。除很大数量的初步设计和技术设计以外，只是这两个工程的施工图就有二万四千张。如果把这些施工图摆开，它的面积有十八亩多；如果把这些施工图连起来，有二十四里长。如果按照目前我国的设计能力计算，这些施工图，一个人需要画上五百年，一九五零年，当鞍钢还在进行恢复工作的时候，苏联政府就开始为大型和无缝等工厂进行总体设计了。莫斯科、列宁格勒、斯维德洛夫斯克等城市的大批最优秀的冶金工厂的设计专家都参加了这一工作。大型、无缝两工程的主要设备全部是苏联为我国制造的，第七号炼铁炉系统的许多机械设备和全部自动化装置也是苏联为我国制造的。这些机械设备和电气设备的数目很惊人。这些设备，从一九五二年就开始源源运到鞍山了。
    苏联为我国大型、无缝两厂所作的设计，和为大型、无缝、七号炼铁炉系统所制造的定货，都是采用了苏联最新科学和技术成就。有些设备在苏联也是刚刚才设计制造成功。因此，三大工程在世界上也要数第一流。这三大工程全部是自动化的，它们的机械设备全部由电气来操纵。如电气工人在无缝钢管厂的主电室里，就可以知道隔墙所有电动机运转的情形。马达过热时，就有红灯亮起来。这时如果还没有人去调整，自动装置就会立即停止送电。又如炼铁炉里的变化非常难掌握，炉内温度的高低和原料下行的快慢，稍微掌握不稳，就要影响出铁的产量和质量。而第七号炼铁炉因为有了自动化的装置，无论炉内炉外发生了任何细微的变化，都随时在信号室里反映出来。这样炼铁炉的生产就可以完全被掌握。
    苏联帮助我国制造的全套设备不只是在生产上表现了它的优越性，而且大大改善工人劳动条件。很多的机器很少的人就可以操纵，因而劳动生产率比一般资本主义国家同类的工厂要高得多。工人又解脱了笨重的体力劳动。如第七号炼铁炉的工人开出铁口时已不需要费老大的力气用大锤了。
    苏联政府和苏联人民对于三大工程的帮助，完全体现了斯大林所说的真理：“问题不仅在于这种帮助是极度便宜的，技术上是头等的。问题首先在于这种合作的基础，是互相帮助和求得共同经济高涨的真诚愿望。”如无缝钢管厂的穿孔机尾座的顶穿棒、自动轧管机和整径机上的风动操纵装置，本来早已运到鞍山，后来苏联因为科学上的新成就，设计制造出了生产效率更好的设备，于是，苏联马上又把这新的产品给我们送来了。为着赶制三大工程的机械和电气设备，莫斯科、列宁格勒、斯维德洛夫斯克、哈尔科夫、基辅等各大城市数十个冶金、机械、电气、工具等制造厂的工人，曾展开了社会主义的劳动竞赛。今年秋天，正是鞍钢三大工程结尾工程最紧张的日子，无缝钢管厂要安装操作盘、大型轧钢厂要信号油标、第七号炼铁炉和大型轧钢厂要补偿导线，苏联政府就特派航空专机把这些设备运来，及时地供应了工程建设的需要。今年九十月间，大型轧钢厂试车和开工生产要几十吨传动滚珠的润滑油，莫洛托夫斯克城制油的职工们，听说是给中国的大型轧钢厂制造一批油，大家都非常高兴，不顾打乱自己的生产计划，很快地就把这批油制造出来了。铁路运输的苏联同志，也打破一般铁路运输的惯例，在一列急行客车的后面，加上为鞍钢运送润滑油的专车，使这批润滑油在十月中旬就到达大型工地，恰好供应大型厂试车的需要。在鞍钢三大工程建设最紧张的时候，苏联政府曾几次派专家从莫斯科赶到鞍山来帮助解决建设中的困难问题；苏联政府驻我国的商务代表团，也多次派代表来鞍钢研究设备和材料的供应情况。
