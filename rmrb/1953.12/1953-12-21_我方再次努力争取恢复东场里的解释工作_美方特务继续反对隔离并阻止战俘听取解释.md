Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 20th. The Korean-Chinese side today made another effort to resume explanation work in the East Camp. In the plan submitted to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission this morning, the Korean-Chinese side requested to conduct explanations to 250 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war in Camp No. 3 tomorrow.

On December 10th, after the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission arranged isolation facilities in the East Camp, the Korean-Chinese side, in accordance with the provisions of the "Working Rules," submitted its explanation work plan daily, requesting to continue the explanation work for Camp No. 53. Later, it requested to change to explaining to the prisoners of war in Camp No. 38, but the explanation work has not been resumed to this day because the US special agents in the camp continue to oppose segregation and prevent the prisoners of war from leaving the camp. The Korean-Chinese side has repeatedly pointed out that only when the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission takes firm measures to break up the US special agent organizations in the camp, remove the terror and violence control suffered by the prisoners of war, and implement the regulations for segregating prisoners of war, can the explanation work proceed smoothly and ensure that prisoners of war have the opportunity to freely apply for repatriation.

    我方再次努力争取恢复东场里的解释工作
    美方特务继续反对隔离并阻止战俘听取解释
     【新华社开城二十日电】朝中方面今天为恢复东场里的解释工作又作了一次努力，在今晨提交给中立国遣返委员会的计划中，朝中方面要求于明日向第三号营场的二百五十名中国人民志愿军被俘人员进行解释。
    十二月十日，中立国遣返委员会在东场里安排了隔离设备以后，朝中方面即按照“工作细则”规定，逐日提出自己的解释工作计划，要求继续完成对五十三号营场的解释工作，以后又要求改向三十八号营场的战俘进行解释，但因营场内的美方特务继续反对隔离，阻止战俘出营场，解释工作至今未能恢复。朝中方面曾一再指出：只有中立国遣返委员会采取坚决措施，打破营场中的美方特务组织，解除战俘所受恐怖和暴力的控制，贯彻隔离战俘的规定，才能使解释工作顺利进行，并保证战俘有自由申请遣返的机会。
