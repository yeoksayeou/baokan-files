At the same time, the state's general line and general tasks should be publicized to the families of revolutionary martyrs, the families of revolutionary soldiers, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers, mobilizing them to actively engage in labor production, participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations and various socialist construction undertakings, and strive for greater glory.

II. All localities should check the work of giving preferential treatment in 1953.

In order to better help the poor families of revolutionary martyrs and the families of revolutionary soldiers (especially the families of revolutionary martyrs) solve difficulties in production and life, various localities may focus on distributing a one-time subsidy in kind during the New Year and Spring Festival. The people's governments above the county (city) level should formulate a plan for the work of giving preferential treatment in 1954 in light of the local conditions, and submit it to the Party and government leaders for unified deployment.

The people's governments of all provinces (cities) and counties should convene座谈会座谈会座谈会座谈会symposia of various organs, departments, organizations, enterprises, and other units to check the implementation of the priority rights of the families of revolutionary martyrs, the families of revolutionary soldiers, and disabled revolutionary soldiers in employment, enrollment, medical treatment, and loans in 1953, and the care for demobilized and transferred soldiers who have been resettled in organs, schools, enterprises, and other units, and discuss and formulate methods for doing a good job in giving preferential treatment in 1954.
