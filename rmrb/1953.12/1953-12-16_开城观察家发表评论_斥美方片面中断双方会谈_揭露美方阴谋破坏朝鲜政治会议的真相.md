Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 15th: A Kaesong observer recently published a commentary regarding the U.S. side's unilateral interruption of the bilateral talks on the political conference issue, stating: The U.S. representative Dean's unilateral action on December 12, 1953, at the plenary session of the bilateral talks on the political conference issue, of abruptly withdrawing from the meeting and declaring an indefinite recess, thoroughly exposed the U.S. side's premeditated conspiracy from the beginning to cause the bilateral talks to be interrupted.

Now that everything has become clear, looking back at the entire record of the bilateral talks over the past forty-eight days, it can be found that the U.S. side's purpose in participating in the bilateral talks was not to promote but to sabotage the Korean political conference. The U.S. conspiracy has now been revealed by Dean's unreasonable actions.

Since the bilateral talks began in Panmunjom on October 26, contrary to our side's sincere attitude of seeking agreement, the U.S. side has consistently adopted means to obstruct the progress of the meeting. On the issue of determining the agenda of the bilateral talks alone, the U.S. side opposed including the issue of political conference members on the agenda, delaying it for a full eighteen days before an agreement was finally reached based on our side's reasonable proposal. Subsequently, at the two subcommittees discussing the issues of members and locations and discussing the issue of time, no agreement was reached for twelve consecutive days due to the U.S. side's obstruction. At that time, the U.S. plan to deliberately prevent the political conference from being held on a reasonable basis was concentrated in the so-called twelve-point "proposal" put forward by Dean at the last meeting of the Members and Location Subcommittee on November 28. In this proposal, although the U.S. side, under pressure from our side's insistence and world public opinion, agreed that some countries other than the belligerent parties could participate in the political conference, it attempted to impose various unreasonable restrictions on their identities and roles. They could only speak at times and places agreed upon by both parties, that is, approved by the U.S. side, and in a manner and order agreed upon by both parties, that is, approved by the U.S. side, rendering our side's suggestion to invite neutral countries to participate in the political conference and enable them to mediate between the two parties and assist them in reaching an agreement, completely destroyed. Even more absurd is that the U.S. "proposal" on the one hand restricts the powers of neutral countries in this way, and on the other hand insists that the Soviet Union, which has always maintained neutrality in the Korean War and has consistently advocated a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, participate in the political conference as a member of our side. The U.S. side unreasonably demands that the Soviet Union be bound by all agreements of the political conference, but at the same time stipulates that the voting procedure of the political conference should adopt the method of "unit voting" by both parties, and "each government participating in the political conference is only bound by the specific agreement it participates in." That is to say, any one of the seventeen member countries of the U.S. side, no matter what agreement the U.S. side reaches with our side as one party, can arbitrarily destroy it on the grounds that it has not participated in this specific agreement.

Obviously, the U.S. "proposal" cannot constitute a basis for both parties to seek an agreement; on the contrary, it can only block the road to negotiation. Therefore, in order to break the deadlock that the bilateral talks had fallen into and eliminate the U.S. side's excuse for delaying, our side suggested that the subcommittee be transferred to the representatives' meeting on November 30. After the representatives' meeting resumed, our side immediately solemnly put forward a comprehensive proposal on the political conference. This comprehensive proposal stipulates that the political conference should be held in New Delhi, India, on December 28 this year, and both parties should invite five neutral countries, namely the Soviet Union, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Burma, to participate in the political conference. In order to take care of the U.S. side's opinions, our side made two concessions, namely agreeing that neutral countries should conduct discussions according to the agenda items determined by agreement between the two parties and should not participate in any voting. However, in addition to this, neutral countries must have the same rights as all countries on both sides to participate in all activities of the political conference, and all resolutions of the political conference can only be established after each member country on both sides participates in the vote and reaches a unanimous agreement.

This comprehensive proposal from the Korean and Chinese sides has put forward clear solutions to various issues related to the political conference, from fundamental principles to administrative details, and has fully taken into account the U.S. side's opinions within a reasonable range. Therefore, it was immediately widely welcomed by world public opinion and was considered to provide a basis for agreement for the bilateral talks and pave the way for the political conference.

However, our side's major effort to show sincerity did not receive any positive response from the U.S. side. Obviously, the U.S. side realized that our side's comprehensive proposal was a major blow to its sabotage conspiracy, but in view of the political and moral superiority of our side's proposal, the U.S. side did not dare to reject it outright and has been taking an attitude of evasion and perfunctoryness. In the six working days after our side's comprehensive proposal was put forward, the U.S. representative requested a recess on two days on the pretext of having to await government instructions or having "unavoidable administrative reasons," refused to clearly express his attitude on one day on the pretext of communication difficulties and not receiving instructions, and sent his advisor Young to the meeting to perfunctorily deal with it on another day on the pretext that Dean had something to do. On the remaining two days, he also deliberately distorted trivial issues and wantonly slandered. Now, it is clear that the only purpose of the U.S. side during these days was to waste time at the meeting in order to put together the hypocritical "draft proposal" it later put forward on December 8 behind the scenes. The purpose of the U.S. side in putting forward this "draft proposal" was only to formally confront our side's comprehensive proposal, so as to confuse the public and make excuses for completely rejecting our side's reasonable proposal.

All the facts that have occurred since then prove that the U.S. side had already made up its mind to cause the bilateral talks to be interrupted when it put forward this "draft proposal." As our side has carefully analyzed, the U.S. "draft proposal" does not have any new constructive content; it is only a summary of the U.S. side's various unreasonable claims that have long been thoroughly refuted by our side. Therefore, it cannot narrow but can only widen the differences between the two parties, which is exactly what the U.S. side intends.

On all fundamental issues regarding how to convene the political conference, the U.S. "draft proposal" is resolutely unacceptable. First of all, on the issue of the participation of neutral countries, the U.S. side still insists on its absurd assertion that the Soviet Union cannot participate in the political conference as a neutral country but only as a belligerent party. As for other neutral countries, the U.S. side only agrees that "some or all of the governments whose nationals are currently working in Korea, or have current experience in Korea, and are now familiar with the Korean issue" may be invited to participate in the political conference by both parties. This extremely ambiguous statement is essentially an attempt to put this top-priority issue aside, so as to deny it completely in the future.

On the issue of the powers of neutral countries, the U.S. side not only insists on the humiliating provision that every word and action of its neutral countries must be approved by the U.S. side before they can be taken, but also further stipulates that neutral countries "shall not make formal motions or suggestions." In this way, the role of neutral countries in the political conference will be reduced to nothing, and any neutral country with self-respect will find it difficult to accept such an invitation, which is equivalent to refusing neutral countries to participate.

On the issue of voting procedures, the U.S. side also stubbornly demands that the two parties vote as one party, while allowing each member country of each party to be bound only by the specific agreements they agree to participate in. In this way, the situation pointed out by the Korean and Chinese sides is entirely possible: Even if the U.S. side can sign an agreement on the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue as the "representative of one party," the Rhee Syngman government, supported by the United States, can still use the excuse of not being bound and resume its conspiracy of armed aggression under the slogan of "northern unification."

On the issue of the agenda, the U.S. "draft proposal" does not propose any agenda at all, but insists on pushing this work completely to the political conference itself to solve, so as to avoid determining now that the political conference must discuss the issue of prisoners of war, so that the political conference will fall into the same quarrels as in the bilateral talks at the beginning without the participation of neutral countries, and actually realize the U.S. side's consistent insistence that the political conference be conducted in two stages.

On the issue of location, although our side has taken care of the U.S. side's opinions and abandoned the originally proposed Panmunjom, and proposed New Delhi, a reasonable and widely accepted location, the U.S. side, after absurdly proposing more than a dozen locations around the world, such as Madrid, Rio de Janeiro, Bangkok, Nice, Mexico City, and Istanbul, still returned to Geneva, which it originally proposed and which our side had already rejected.

On the issue of time, after dragging the bilateral talks into endless disputes, the U.S. side still clung to its formula that the political conference should be held 28 to 42 days after an agreement is reached on the entire agenda of the bilateral talks, placing the date of the political conference in a vague and unknowable future.

All of this is what the U.S. side calls the "final proposal," and what the U.S. side is forcing the Korean and Chinese sides to accept immediately and completely. Needless to say, anyone can see that this "final proposal" is neither acceptable nor can it serve as a basis for agreement between the two parties. Now, as long as you check the meeting records, you can see that the U.S. side had completed all its arrangements to interrupt the bilateral talks when it put forward its so-called "final draft proposal." This "draft proposal" was put forward at the meeting on December 8, and it was immediately comprehensively refuted by our side's representatives and resolutely rejected by our side. However, the next day, December 9, Dean still pretended to be serious and asked to "sign this draft agreement on the spot and immediately" with our side. On the third day, December 10, Dean deliberately read out a hypocritical announcement on the political conference from the Bermuda meeting of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France at the meeting, and once again proposed, "Let us sign it." On the fourth day, December 11, Dean even threatened our side with a recess twice to sign, saying: "I propose that you sign, otherwise, we will recess." If people know that the U.S. proposal had already been completely refuted by our side and it was made clear that it could not be accepted, if people know that, despite this, our side's representatives still patiently analyzed the U.S.'s various proposals to Dean one by one at each meeting, explaining why they would not work at all, and if people know that our side's representatives had pointed out to Dean that the ambiguity of the U.S.'s proposal to invite "some governments" to participate in the political conference was being fiercely opposed by the Rhee Syngman government, so it was not even believable that Dean had the right to sign an agreement that could be followed by each member of his party, then people can only draw one conclusion from this ridiculous action: Dean's only purpose was to follow the predetermined conspiracy of "break if you don't accept" to finally lead the bilateral talks to a dead end.

Dean's rogue tactics were met with our side's solemn opposition. Our side's representative resolutely demanded that Dean abandon his nonsense that this "draft proposal" was a "final proposal," and asked Dean to honestly sit down and seriously discuss the issue. However, Dean was obviously impatient.

Dean's attitude at the December 12 meeting revealed the true nature of imperialists, who will not hesitate to take any means to achieve their despicable goals. On the one hand, Dean avoided answering the various questions that our side raised on the voting procedure, and on the other hand, he frantically demanded that our side's representative sign his "draft proposal" with him immediately as many as three times, and openly threatened our side that if we were unwilling to sign, it would be equivalent to indicating that the meeting would enter an indefinite recess. Dean's hooligan intimidation tactics, of course, could not have any effect on our side's representative. Our side's representative told Dean frankly that our side opposed the proposal for an indefinite recess and firmly wanted him to sit down and continue discussing the issue. At this point, Dean, seeing that it was really difficult to find an excuse to break, suddenly had a whimsical idea to find an excuse in our side's speech criticizing the U.S. side for signing the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and then condoning the Rhee Syngman government's forced detention of our side's 27,000 captured personnel as an act of breach of trust. He insisted that our side's speech was an untrue accusation and insult to the U.S. government and demanded that our side withdraw it. Otherwise, it would be equivalent to our side notifying him that we were willing to have the bilateral talks enter an indefinite recess, and then he brazenly ignored our side's protest and left the meeting.

Dean's performance at the meeting on December 12 was like a clown performing a farce. Whether during the armistice negotiations or during the bilateral talks, our side has repeatedly pointed out that the U.S. side's condoning of Rhee Syngman's forced detention of our side's captured personnel has been recorded in history as an undeniable act of breach of trust. Not only did Clark and Harrison dare not deny this, but even Dean himself never dared to deny it when our side raised accusations against him at various bilateral meetings. Now, Dean suddenly seized on this point at the last minute as an excuse to interrupt the bilateral talks, which only shows how eager the U.S. side was to interrupt the bilateral talks.

If we look back at the records of the bilateral talks, we can also find that it was Dean himself, not others, who often took provocative actions at the meeting table and made insulting remarks. Shortly after the bilateral talks began, Dean groundlessly attacked the Soviet Union and slandered our side as the Soviet Union's "agent." Our side made a serious protest to Dean and demanded that he withdraw this insulting remark. This matter has not ended to this day, but our side did not think that this should interrupt the talks. From this point, we can also see who is sincerely working to promote the convening of the political conference and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and who is deliberately sabotaging it. People here cannot but agree with the convincing argument repeatedly put forward by the representatives of the Korean and Chinese sides: The United States, which is currently frantically creating tension and promoting its policy of arms expansion and war preparations all over the world, especially in the East, is afraid that the convening of the political conference may ease the tense situation in the world, especially in the East, so it does not dare to convene the political conference at all.

Due to the U.S. side's unilateral action of interrupting the bilateral talks, the unstable armistice in Korea has been seriously threatened. There are now two paths in front of the U.S. side: One is to sincerely repent and return to the meeting table to continue negotiating with our side on a plan to hold a political conference. This will be the only path that the U.S. side should choose. The other is to stubbornly adhere to the policy of sabotaging the Korean armistice and refusing to convene a political conference, so that the bilateral talks will be interrupted to the end. This will be a very dangerous path. If the U.S. side insists on the latter path, it must be prepared to bear all its serious consequences.

    斥美方片面中断双方会谈
    揭露美方阴谋破坏朝鲜政治会议的真相
    【新华社开城十五日电】开城观察家顷就美方片面中断关于政治会议问题的双方会谈事发表评论称：美方代表迪安于一九五三年十二月十二日在关于政治会议问题双方会谈全体会议上，采取片面行动悍然退出会议并宣布进入无限期休会的行为，彻底暴露了美方从头以来即处心积虑使双方会谈陷于中断的阴谋。
    现在，当一切已经明朗化以后，再来回顾四十八天以来的双方会谈的全部记录，就可以发现美方来参加双方会谈的目的，不是为了要促成而是为了要破坏朝鲜政治会议。美方的这种阴谋，现在已因迪安的无理行动而真相大白。
    从双方会谈自十月二十六日起在板门店开始以来，与我方诚意寻求协议的态度相反，美方一贯采取阻挠会议进展的手段。仅在确定双方会谈议程的问题上，即由于美方反对把政治会议成员问题列入议程而拖延了整整十八天，最后始在我方合理建议的基础上达成了协议。其后，在讨论成员与地点问题和讨论时间问题的两个小组委员会上，又由于美方的百般阻挠而连续十二天未能取得任何协议。当时美方蓄意不让政治会议在合理基础上召开的计划，集中地表现在迪安在十一月二十八日成员与地点问题小组委员会最后一次会议上提出的所谓十二点“建议”。在这个建议中，美方虽然迫于我方的坚持与世界舆论的压力，同意可以由交战双方以外的若干国家参加政治会议，然而却企图把他们的身份和作用加以种种无理限制。它们只能在双方一致同意的、亦即经美方批准的时间与场合下，依照双方一致同意的、亦即经美方批准的方式与次序发言，使我方建议邀请中立国参加政治会议、使之能在双方间从事斡旋、协助双方取得协议的作用，为之破坏无遗。更荒谬的是美方的“建议”一方面如此限制中立国的权限，一方面却硬要始终在朝鲜战争中严守中立、并一贯倡议和平解决朝鲜问题的苏联作为我方之一员而参加政治会议。美方无理地要求苏联须受政治会议一切协议的约束，但同时却又规定政治会议表决程序采取双方“单位表决”的办法，而“每一参加政治会议的政府仅受它所参与的特定的协议的约束”。这就是说，美方十七个成员国中的任何一个，不论美方作为一方与我方达成何种协议，都可以藉口自己未参与这一特定协议而任意加以破坏。
    显然，美方的“建议”不但不能构成双方谋求协议的基础，相反地只能堵塞谈判前进的道路。因此，我方为了打破双方会谈业已陷入的僵局，解除美方拖延的藉口，建议将小组委员会在十一月三十日转入代表会议。在代表会议恢复以后，我方就立即郑重提出了关于政治会议的全面建议。这个全面建议，规定政治会议应于今年十二月二十八日在印度新德里召开，双方应邀请苏联、印度、印度尼西亚、巴基斯坦、缅甸等五个中立国参加政治会议。为了照顾美方的意见，我方作了两点让步，即同意中立国应按照双方协议确定的议程项目来进行讨论，并不参加任何表决。但除此以外，中立国必须有与双方各国同等的权利参加政治会议的全部活动，政治会议的一切决议，须经双方每一成员国参加表决并取得一致协议以后始能成立。
    朝中方面的这个全面建议，对于有关政治会议的各项问题，从根本原则到行政细节都提出了明确的解决办法，并在合理的范围以内，充分照顾到了美方的意见。因此，它立即受到世界舆论的普遍欢迎，被认为是替双方会谈提供了协议的基础，替政治会议铺平了道路。
    但是，我方这种表现诚意的重大努力，并没有得到美方任何积极的反应。显然美方认识到我方的全面建议对于它的破坏阴谋是一个重大打击，然而鉴于我方建议在政治上与道义上的优势，美方不敢对此悍然拒绝，就一直采取躲避搪塞的态度。在我方全面建议提出以后的六个工作日中，美方代表藉口须听候政府指示或有“不可避免的行政性理由”而要求休会者有两天，藉口通讯困难没有接获指示而拒绝明确表示态度者有一天，藉口迪安有事不能出席而由其顾问杨格到会敷衍者又有一天，其余两天也在枝节问题上故意歪曲，大肆诽谤。现在，已经清楚，美方在这几天的时间内，唯一的目的是想在会上耗磨时间，以便在背后拼凑它后来在十二月八日提出来的虚伪的“建议草案”。而美方提出这个“建议草案”的目的仅是为了要在形式上与我方的全面建议相对抗，以便迷乱世人耳目，为全部拒绝我方合理建议作藉口。
    以后发生的一切事实，证明美方在提出这个“建议草案”时，就已经下定了使双方会谈陷于中断的决心。如我方所仔细分析过的那样，美方的“建议草案”没有任何新的建设性内容，它只是美方过去各项老早为我方彻底驳倒的无理主张的总和，因此它不仅不能缩小反而只能扩大双方间的分歧，而这却正是美方的用意所在。
    在关于政治会议如何召开的一切根本问题上，美方的“建议草案”都是决然无法令人接受的。首先，在关于中立国参加的问题上，美方仍然坚持其苏联不能作为中立国而仅能作为交战一方参加政治会议的荒谬主张。至于其他中立国家，美方只同意可由双方邀请“凡其国民现在正在朝鲜担负工作，或在朝鲜有当前经验，并对朝鲜的问题现在是熟悉的某些或所有的政府”参加政治会议。这种极为暧昧的说法，实质上就已企图把这个头等重要的问题搁置起来，以便于将来根本赖掉。
      在中立国权限的问题上，美方不但仍然坚持其中立国的一言一动均须得美方批准而后可的侮辱性规定，而且还进一步规定中立国“不得提出正式动议或建议”。这样，中立国在政治会议中的作用就将化为乌有，而且任何一个有自尊心的中立国也决难接受此种邀请，结果就等于拒绝中立国参加。
    在表决程序问题上，美方也仍然顽固地要求双方作为一方来进行表决，同时又允许每方成员国仅受自己同意参加的特定的协议的约束，这样就完全可能出现朝中方面所指出的那种情况：纵然美方可作为“一方的代表”而在和平解决朝鲜问题的协议上签了字，美国支持下的李承晚政府却仍然可以藉口不受约束，而在“北进统一”的口号下恢复其武装侵略的阴谋。
    在议程问题上，美方“建议草案”中根本没有提出什么议程，而主张把这个工作完全推到政治会议本身去解决，这样就可避开现在就确定政治会议必须讨论战俘问题，使政治会议一开始就将在没有中立国参加的情况下陷入如同在双方会谈中一样的争吵，而实际上实现了美方所一贯主张的政治会议分成两个阶段进行的意图。
    在地点问题上，虽然我方已照顾到美方的意见而放弃了原来提议的板门店，并提出了新德里这样一个合情合理并已为舆论所接受的地点，美方却在荒唐地提出了马德里、里约热内卢、曼谷、尼斯、墨西哥城、伊斯坦布尔等等遍及全世界的十几个地点之后，还是回到它最初提出并早经我方拒绝的日内瓦。
    在时间问题上，美方在已经把双方会谈拖进了无休止的争论以后，还死抱住它那政治会议应在双方会谈全部议程取得协议之后二十八天以后、四十二天以前召开的公式，把政治会议召开的日期置于渺茫不可知的将来。
    所有这一切，就是被美方叫做“最后建议”的东西，就是美方立逼着朝中方面必须立即全盘接受的东西。不用说，任何人都看得出来，这个“最后建议”是既不能接受，也不能作为双方协议的基础的。现在只要检查一下会议记录，就可以看出美方在提出它所谓“最后的建议草案”时，就已完成了它中断双方会谈的全部布置。这个“建议草案”是在十二月八日的会议上提出来的，它当场就受到了我方代表全面的批驳，并遭到我方断然拒绝。然而到第二天，即十二月九日，迪安仍然煞有介事似地要求与我方“在这一协议草案上当场并立即签字”。到第三天，十二月十日，迪安故意在会上读了一段英、美、法三国百慕大会议关于政治会议的伪善的公告，再次提出“让我们在它上面签字”。到第四天，即十二月十一日，迪安竟然两次以休会威胁我方签字说：“我提议你签字，不然的话，我们就休会。”如果人们知道，美方的这个建议草案早已为我方所完全驳倒，并明白表示不能接受，如果人们知道，虽然如此，我方代表还是在每天会议上不厌其烦地向迪安逐一分析美方的各项建议，说明其根本行不通，又如果人们知道，我方代表曾向迪安指出美方建议中所谓邀请“某些政府”参加政治会议的规定的暧味与正受到李承晚政府的激烈反对，因此甚至迪安有权签订一个能为本方各成员国遵守的协议都还无法令人置信，那末，人们就只能对这种可笑的行动得出一个结论：迪安的唯一目的就是要按照
  “不接受就破裂”的预定阴谋，把双方会谈最后引上绝路。
    迪安的这种无赖手段遭到了我方严正的反对。我方代表坚决要求迪安放弃他所谓这个“建议草案”是“最后建议”的胡说，要迪安老老实实坐下来认真讨论问题，然而迪安显然已迫不及待了。
    迪安在十二月十二日会议上的态度，揭露了帝国主义者为了要达到自己的卑劣目的，而不惜采取任何手段的本色。迪安一方面避不答复我方就表决程序方面提出的各项必须答复的问题，一方面却疯狂地要求我方代表与他立即在其“建议草案”上签字达三次之多，而且公然威胁我方如不愿意签字，即等于表示会议进入无限期休会。迪安的这种流氓恐吓手段，当然不能对我方代表发生任何作用。我方代表正告迪安，我方反对无限期休会的建议，并坚决要他坐下来继续讨论问题。至此，迪安鉴于实在难以找到破裂的藉口，忽然异想天开地在我方指责美方在“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”签字以后，纵容李承晚政府强迫扣留我方二万七千名被俘人员一举为背信弃义行为的发言中，找寻藉口，硬说我方的发言为对美国政府不真实的指控和侮辱，要求我方收回。否则，就等于我方通知他表示愿使双方会谈进入无限期休会，然后就悍然不顾我方的抗议而退出了会场。
    迪安十二月十二日在会场上的表演，就像一个丑角在演出一幕滑稽戏一样。不论在停战谈判期间，还是在双方会谈期间，我方均曾一再指出美方纵容李承晚强迫扣留我方被俘人员一事，已被作为无可抵赖的背信弃义行为而载入历史记录。不但克拉克与哈利逊对此不敢否认，就是迪安自己当我方在双方历次会议上向他提出指责时也从来不敢否认。现在迪安忽然在最后一分钟抓住这一点，作为中断双方会谈的藉口，只足以表明美方之亟欲中断双方会谈，已情急到了何等程度。
      如果再回顾一下双方会谈的记录，那末还可以发现在会议桌上经常采取挑衅行为，发表侮辱言论的不是别人，正是迪安自己。在双方会谈开始后不久，迪安就曾无端攻击苏联，并诬蔑我方为苏联的“代理人”，我方为此曾向迪安提出严重抗议，要求他撤回这种侮辱性言论，此事到今仍未结束，然而我方并没有认为因此就该中断会谈。就这一点，也可以看出谁在真心为促成政治会议的召开与朝鲜问题的和平解决而努力，谁在蓄意破坏。人们于此，不能不同意朝中方面代表所一再提出的令人信服的论点：目前正在全世界特别是在东方疯狂地制造紧张局势、推行其扩军备战政策的美国，害怕政治会议的召开可能使世界的特别是东方的紧张局势趋于缓和，因此它根本不敢召开政治会议。
    由于美方片面中断双方会谈的行动，朝鲜不稳定的停战已受到了严重的威胁。现在摆在美方面前的有两条道路：一条是诚心悔祸回到会议桌上来，继续与我方谈判出一个举行政治会议的方案，这将是美方唯一应该选择的道路。一条是顽固地坚持破坏朝鲜停战、拒绝召开政治会议的政策，使双方会谈中断到底，这将是一条十分危险的道路。如果美方坚持后一条道路，它必须准备承担其全部的严重后果。
