    Anshan Iron and Steel Company's three major construction projects received great help from Soviet experts.
    Romanenko, the leader of the Soviet experts working at Anshan Iron and Steel, Anikeev, the head of the design and installation expert group, Belyatkach, the head of the design expert group, and other Soviet experts helped the massive and technically complex three major projects avoid many mistakes, take fewer detours, ensure project quality, and shorten construction time. With his extensive knowledge and rich experience, Romanenko led the Soviet experts at Anshan Iron and Steel, promptly solving various difficult problems from design and construction to commissioning in the three major projects, and helped plan the construction and preparations for commissioning, enabling the three major projects to be completed smoothly. Romanenko also helped the Anshan Iron and Steel's capital construction department rationally adjust its organizational structure, strengthen planning management and the responsibility system, effectively improving the management and technical levels of Anshan Iron and Steel's capital construction department, based on advanced Soviet experience and the specific situation of Anshan Iron and Steel. Under the specific guidance of expert Belyatkach, the volume of the hearth of the No. 7 blast furnace was expanded, the bottom of the furnace was thickened, and the original hearth's cooling wall was changed to a brick-embedded type. This can extend the life of the blast furnace and increase the production of pig iron by several thousand tons per year, which is equivalent to adding a small blast furnace. Soviet furnace-building expert Budanenk guided and helped the furnace-building site use brick grinding machines, bricklaying machines, belt conveyors, dump trucks, mud pumps, mud mixers, etc., to replace heavy physical labor and improve work efficiency. As soon as the furnace-building workers operate the machinery, they think of the help of Soviet experts and the bright prospects of fully mechanized construction.
    Electrical adjustment is a complex task in building a mechanized and automated factory. After completing the work at the seamless steel tube plant, Soviet electrical adjustment expert Radosev immediately undertook the most difficult and complex main drive adjustment work at the large rolling mill. Under his precise and meticulous guidance, various complex and precise instruments, red and green signal signs, automatic electrical switches, generators, and large motors were quickly adjusted. Therefore, the giant rolling mill of the large rolling mill was able to start rotating on November 25, six days ahead of schedule. As soon as the work at the large rolling mill was completed, people saw expert Radosev adjusting the electrical equipment on the hoist of the No. 7 blast furnace. As the date for the blast furnace to produce iron drew closer and the snow fell heavier, expert Radosev's work became increasingly intense. He did not rest for several nights in a row, lying down in the hoist room when he was tired, and eating some bread casually when he was hungry. His great spirit of internationalism deeply moved and educated the Chinese workers who were building the No. 7 blast furnace.
    Under the education of the Party of Lenin and Stalin, Marchenko, Kuzmink, Babutienko, Kashkevich, Konyukhov, Shishov, Gradskov, and many other Soviet experts, like expert Radosev, actively helped our country build the newest type of mechanized and automated factory in history with the noble qualities of Soviet people. Their great achievements will be forever recorded in the hearts of every Chinese person.
    Under the specific and meticulous guidance of Soviet experts, the people building the three major projects of Anshan Iron and Steel have learned many advanced Soviet experiences and advanced technologies. The technical strength of the electrical installation engineering company has increased fourfold in the past year. More than 150 people have begun to learn complex electrical adjustment techniques under the guidance of expert Radosev, and many workers have also learned extremely precise electrical adjustment techniques for AC machines, frequency converters, high-frequency, low-frequency, and hot cutting saws. Experts such as Anikeev and Marchenko adopted methods such as special lectures and teaching while doing to help many workers in the mechanical installation engineering company learn advanced experiences such as measurement and installation, bearing cleaning and adjustment, hot loading and unloading, pre-installation, and deformation treatment, helping our country cultivate a large number of mechanical installation talents.
    More than 70 workers from Anshan Iron and Steel who were sent to the Soviet Ural No. 1 Seamless Steel Tube Plant and the Shataghir Large Steel Rolling Mill for internships received enthusiastic help and care from Soviet comrades during their internships in the Soviet Union. Now, they have become the first batch of Chinese workers to master automated steel rolling technology. Under the guidance of Soviet experts Kernilov, Ivanov, and young steel rolling machine adjustment expert Kugayev, who won the Stalin Prize, the production technology of workers in large rolling mills and seamless steel tube plants has gradually become proficient, ensuring the successful start-up of the two plants.

    鞍钢三大工程得到苏联专家的伟大帮助
    鞍山钢铁公司三大建设工程得到苏联专家伟大的帮助。
    驻鞍山钢铁公司工作的苏联专家领导人罗曼柯、设计安装专家组长安尼克也夫、设计专家组长别雷特卡其和其他苏联专家们，帮助规模浩大、技术复杂的三大工程避免了许多错误，少走了许多弯路，保证了工程质量，缩短了建设时间。罗曼柯以广博的知识和丰富的经验，领导着鞍钢的苏联专家们，及时地解决了三大工程从设计施工到开工生产中的各种疑难问题，帮助筹划了施工和迎接开工生产的准备工作，使三大工程得以顺利完成。罗曼柯还根据苏联先进经验和鞍钢的具体情况，帮助鞍钢基本建设部门合理地调整了组织机构，加强了计划管理和责任制，有效地提高了鞍钢基本建设部门的管理水平和技术水平。经别雷特卡其专家的具体指导，第七号炼铁炉炉缸的容积扩大了，炉底加厚了，原有炉缸的冷却壁改成了镶砖式。这样炼铁炉的寿命可以延长，每年还可以增产几千吨生铁，等于多增加了一个小炼铁炉。苏联筑炉专家布丹涅克，指导和帮助筑炉工地用磨砖机、砌砖机、皮带运输机、翻斗运输机、泥浆压送机、泥浆搅拌机等，代替笨重的体力劳动，提高了工作效率。筑炉工人一操纵机械，就想到苏联专家的帮助，想到全部机械化施工的美好远景。
    电气调整是建设机械化自动化工厂的一项复杂工作。苏联电气调整专家拉多赛夫在完成了无缝钢管厂的工作之后，马上又担负起大型轧钢厂最艰难最复杂的主传动调整工作。在他精确而细致的指导下，各种复杂精密的仪表、红绿信号标志、自动的电气开关、发电机和大马达等很快就调整好了。因此，大型轧钢厂的巨型轧钢机就能在十一月二十五日开始转动，比原定计划提早六天。大型轧钢厂的工作刚刚结束，人们又看到拉多赛夫专家在七号炼铁炉的卷扬机上调整电气设备了。炼铁炉准备出铁的日子越来越近、雪越飘越大，拉多赛夫专家的工作也越来越紧张。他接连好几个夜晚没有休息，疲劳了就在卷扬机室躺一下，饿了就随便吃一些面包。他的这种伟大的国际主义精神，深深地感动和教育了建设七号炼铁炉的我国职工。
    在列宁、斯大林党的教养下，马尔琴克、库兹明克、柏布坚克、卡什克维奇、柯纽霍夫、什少夫、格拉德斯阔夫和其他许多苏联专家，也都像拉多赛夫专家一样，以苏维埃人的高贵品质，积极帮助我国建立起历史上最新型的机械化自动化工厂。他们的丰功伟绩，将永远记载在每一个中国人民的心里。
    在苏联专家具体细致的教导下，建设鞍钢三大工程的人们，学会了许多苏联先进经验和先进技术。电气安装工程公司的技术力量一年多来已增加四倍，有一百五十多人在拉多赛夫专家的指导下，开始学会了复杂的电气调整技术，还有不少工人学会了交流机、变频机、高周波、低周波、热切锯等极为精密的电气调整技术。安尼克也夫、马尔琴克等专家采取专题讲课、边做边教等方式，帮助机械安装工程公司的许多工人学会了测量安装、轴承的清洗调整、热装卸、预安装、变形处理等先进经验，帮助我国培养了大批的机械安装人才。
    被派到苏联乌拉尔第一无缝钢管厂和夏塔吉尔大型压钢厂实习的鞍钢七十多个职工，在苏联实习时，曾得到苏联同志的热诚帮助和关怀。现在，他们已成为新中国第一批掌握自动化轧钢技术的工人。在苏联专家克尔尼洛夫、伊万诺夫和荣获斯大林奖金的青年轧钢机调整专家库嘉也夫的教导下，大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂工人的生产技术已逐渐熟练起来，保证了两厂的胜利开工。　（新华社）
