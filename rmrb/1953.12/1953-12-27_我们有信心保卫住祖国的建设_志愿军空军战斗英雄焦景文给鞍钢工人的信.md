We Have Confidence to Defend the Construction of the Motherland
—A Letter from Volunteer Army Air Force Combat Hero Jiao Jingwen to Anshan Iron and Steel Workers

Dear worker comrades of Anshan Iron and Steel:

    When I heard the news that the first mechanized and automated seamless steel tube plant in the motherland had been completed and the first batch of seamless steel tubes had been rolled out, I was deeply moved by your high patriotic labor enthusiasm and great creative spirit. First of all, let me warmly congratulate you and express my cordial respect.

    Seamless steel tubes are urgently needed materials for the industrial construction of the motherland. We need a large number of seamless steel tubes to consolidate national defense, exploit underground treasures, build large factories and power plants, and develop transportation. In the past, our motherland could not manufacture this kind of seamless steel tube and had to order it from abroad every year at a great cost. However, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, with the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, and with your active efforts, the first seamless steel tube plant in the motherland was finally established. It will manufacture a large number of seamless steel tubes for the motherland and accelerate the process of industrialization. The brilliant achievements you have made in the great cause of building the motherland have deeply inspired me and my comrades. Congratulations on your victory on the production front.

    We in Korea are very concerned about the economic construction of the motherland. Whenever the newspapers are delivered, everyone automatically organizes to read them; when they read news about the economic construction of the motherland, everyone's spirits are even more uplifted, and some even take notes in their notebooks. They say, "This is a major event related to the industrialization of our country!"

    Dear worker comrades! I can tell you that you have launched a patriotic labor competition in the factory, and we have also launched a competition in technical and tactical learning in Korea; everyone is in high spirits for learning, and technical and tactical research groups have also been formed. We humbly study flight technology and tactics, and record every bit of experience from others in our notebooks. Some comrades are afraid of forgetting what they have learned, so they get up before dawn to review what they have learned. The leaders, for the sake of the comrades' health, advise them not to do this, but they all say, "Only by learning technology well and improving tactics can we better defend the economic construction of the motherland."

    Dear worker comrades! Although the Korean armistice negotiations were signed on July 27, we know deeply that this is only the first step in resolving the Korean issue. During this period of armistice, the enemy still often violates the agreement, detains our captured personnel, and enemy planes still cross the border to infringe upon us. The warmongers are still clamoring to expand the war, which further increases our unparalleled hatred for the enemy. In order to defend the economic construction of the motherland and the happy life of the people, in order to defend peace in the Far East and the world, we assure you: We will definitely implement Marshal Kim Il-sung's and Commander Peng Dehuai's orders in an exemplary manner, faithfully implement the armistice agreement, continue to strengthen technical and tactical learning, heighten vigilance, and stick to our combat posts. If the enemy dares to violate the armistice agreement, we will give the enemy a powerful counterattack. We have full confidence in defending the material wealth created by your hard work for the people of the motherland, and in defending the economic construction of the motherland and the happy life of the people.

    Finally, I also hope that we, in our different work positions, will launch a friendly patriotic competition for the same goal, and join hands to advance bravely for the overfulfillment of the state's production plan, for the defense of the motherland's security, and for peace in the Far East and the world!

    I wish you good health.
        Chinese People's Volunteer Army Air Force Combat Hero, Jiao Jingwen

    我们有信心保卫住祖国的建设
    ——志愿军空军战斗英雄焦景文给鞍钢工人的信亲爱的鞍钢的工人同志们：
    当我听到祖国第一座机械化自动化无缝钢管厂已经竣工并轧出了第一批无缝钢管的消息后，我深深为你们高度的爱国主义劳动热情和伟大的创造精神所感动。首先让我向你们热烈地祝贺并表示亲切的敬意。
    无缝钢管厂是祖国工业建设迫切需要的材料。我们要巩固国防，开采地下的宝藏，建设大工厂、发电厂和发展运输事业，都离不开大量的无缝钢管。过去，我们祖国不能制造这种无缝钢管，每年要用大量金钱向国外订货。但是，在毛主席和中国共产党的英明领导下，在苏联专家的热诚帮助下，在你们积极的努力下，终于把祖国第一座无缝钢管厂建立起来了。它将给祖国制造大量的无缝钢管，加速祖国工业化的进程。你们在建设祖国的伟大事业中所取得的辉煌成绩，深深地鼓舞了我和我的战友们。祝贺你们在生产战线上的胜利。
    我们在朝鲜都非常关心祖国的经济建设。每当报纸送来后，大家都自动组织读报；读到祖国经济建设消息的时候，大家的精神更为振奋，有的还把它摘记在笔记本上。他们说：“这是关系我们国家工业化的大事！”
    亲爱的工人同志们！我可以告诉你们，你们在工厂里展开了爱国主义的劳动竞赛，我们在朝鲜也展开了技术、战术学习竞赛；大家学习的情绪很高，还编成了技术、战术研究小组，虚心地研究飞行技术和战术，把别人一点一滴的经验都记在自己的本子上，有的同志怕把学的东西忘了，天没亮就起来复习学过的东西。首长为了同志们的身体健康，劝他们不要这样做，他们都说：“只有学好技术和提高战术，才能更好的保卫祖国经济建设。”
    亲爱的工人同志们！朝鲜停战谈判虽然在七月二十七日签字了，但我们深深知道，这只是解决朝鲜问题的第一步。在这停战的时间里，敌人还时常破坏协议，扣留我方被俘人员，敌人的飞机还在越境侵犯我们，野心家还叫嚣扩大战争，这些更增加我们对敌人的无比愤恨。为了保卫祖国的经济建设和人民的幸福生活，为了保卫远东及世界和平，我们向你们保证：一定模范地执行金日成元帅和彭德怀司令员的命令，确切实施停战协定，继续加强技术、战术学习，提高警惕，坚守战斗岗位，假如敌人敢于破坏停战协议，我们将给予敌人以有力还击。我们完全有信心保卫住你们辛勤劳动给祖国人民创造出来的物质财富，保卫住祖国的经济建设和人民的幸福生活。
    最后还希望我们在不同的工作岗位上，为着同一的目的，展开友谊的爱国主义竞赛，为超额完成国家的生产计划，为保卫祖国的安全、为远东及世界和平携手奋勇前进！
    祝你们身体健康
        中国人民志愿军空军战斗英雄　焦景文
