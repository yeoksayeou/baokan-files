    The CPC Siyang County Committee Has Ordered Wu Shikui to Make a Public Self-Criticism for Superstitious and Wasteful Behavior
    The CPC Siyang County Committee of Jiangsu Province writes: The "Reader's Letters in Brief" column on October 6th published readers' criticisms of Wu Shikui, secretary of the Yingmen District Committee of our county, for superstitious and wasteful behavior. The situation is factual. We have ordered Comrade Wu Shikui to make a public self-criticism at the Yingmen District Township Cadre Meeting and the Tanba Township Mass Meeting in Likou District. Because the comrade's understanding of his mistakes was profound and his self-criticism was relatively thorough, the County Committee decided to exempt him from punishment. In addition, we will circulate this matter to all districts in the county for attention so that similar incidents will not occur in the future.

    中共泗阳县委已责成吴士奎对迷信浪费行为作公开检讨
    中共江苏省泗阳县委会来信：十月六日“读者来信摘要”栏登载了读者对本县营门区区委书记吴士奎有迷信和浪费行为的批评，情况属实。我们已责成吴士奎同志在营门区区乡干部会和李口区谭坝乡群众会上作了公开检讨。由于该同志认识错误和检讨比较深刻，县委决定免予处分。此外，我们并将这件事通报全县各区注意，使今后不再发生类似事件。
