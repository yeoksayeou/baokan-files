Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Winter crops are growing very lushly in various parts of the Southwest region. Farmers are strengthening field management to strive for increased production next year.

This autumn, farmers in various parts of the Southwest accumulated a lot of fertilizer. Most wheat and rapeseed fields have sufficient base fertilizer. Some farmers have also adopted close-planting of wheat in rows, thus ensuring the good growth of winter crops. Under the impetus of agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid teams, farmers in various parts of Sichuan Province have expanded the planting area of wheat and rapeseed according to national needs. In the Suining Special District of the province, the wheat sowing area has been expanded by about 5% compared to last year, under the leadership of seven agricultural producers' cooperatives and various mutual aid teams. Wheat seedlings in the Western Sichuan Plain are generally seven to eight inches tall, and rapeseed has grown to five to six inches tall. In Simao, Puer, Mojiang, Jinggu, and other counties in Yunnan Province, the weather was suitable during autumn sowing, and all kinds of winter crops were sown according to the season, and are now growing well. Currently, farmers in the Western Sichuan Plain and the Ya'an and Xichang Special Districts of Xikang Province are actively carrying out activities such as pest control, thinning, weeding, and applying topdressing fertilizer to winter crops. After studying the General Line, members of the Feng Jifa Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jintang County, Sichuan Province, sold more than 16,000 jin of surplus grain to the state and then bought 700 loads of night soil. The Wang Lida Mutual Aid Team in Zhongjiang County bought more than 1,200 jin of oil cake and ammonium sulfate fertilizers after selling grain, which were used as topdressing fertilizer for winter crops. Wheat and rapeseed in Fulin, Shuichi, and other villages in Yingjing County, Xikang Province, have already been weeded, and many farmers have applied a topdressing of fertilizer ahead of schedule.

    西南区各地小春作物生长非常茂盛
    据新华社讯：西南区各地小春作物长得很茂盛，农民们正加强田间管理，争取明年增产。
    西南各地农民今秋积肥很多，大部分麦田和油菜田的底肥充足，有些农民还采用了小麦条播密植，因而保证了小春作物生长良好。四川省各地农民在农业生产合作社和互助组的带动下，按照国家需要扩大了小麦和油菜的种植面积。该省遂宁专区在七个农业生产合作社和各互助组的带动下，小麦播种面积约比去年扩大百分之五。川西平原的小麦苗一般已达七八寸，油菜已长到五六寸高。云南省思茅、普洱、墨江、景谷等县秋种时天气适宜，各类小春作物都按节令下种，现在长得很好。现川西平原和西康省雅安、西昌等专区的农民，正积极展开小春作物杀虫、间苗、耘草、施追肥等活动。四川省金堂县酆纪发农业生产合作社社员在学习总路线后，全社卖了一万六千多斤余粮给国家，跟着就买了七百挑水粪。中江县王礼达互助组卖粮后买了油饼、硫酸錏等肥料一千二百多斤，用作小春作物的追肥。西康省荥经县富林、水池等村的小麦、油菜已将薅完，很多农民都提早上了一道追肥。
