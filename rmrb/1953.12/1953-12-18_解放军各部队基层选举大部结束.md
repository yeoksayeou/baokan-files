Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Cadres and soldiers of various units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are participating in the general election with great political enthusiasm. At present, some units have completely concluded the basic-level elections, and others have largely completed them.

    The basic-level elections of organs and units directly under the Central People's Government's Revolutionary Military Commission have been concluded. Now, various units are deliberating on the election of representatives to attend the military representatives' congress of the organs and units directly under the People's Revolutionary Military Commission. In the basic-level elections, the candidates proposed by various units have been repeatedly discussed. On the day of the election, all organs, units, and schools presented a festive scene. All revolutionary soldiers who had reached the age of eighteen wore neat and clean clothes and solemnly cast their votes into the ballot box with excitement. PLA wounded and sick soldiers recuperating in hospitals and sanatoriums also voted. Many of those participating in the election were cadres and soldiers who had experienced long revolutionary struggles. Their mood was particularly excited. He Zhongcai, who participated in the Long March of the Red Army, said during the election: "This glorious right is inseparable from the hard struggle of the People's Liberation Army. We must especially respect it."
    The general election work of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Public Security Forces has been fully launched, and many units have completed the basic-level elections. On the day of the election, comrades held their ballots in their hands and were indescribably excited. For example, Yu Chenglong, a soldier of the Liaodong Provincial Public Security Corps, felt his heart pounding with excitement after receiving the ballot at the military conference. He carefully wrote the names of the people he was most satisfied with on the ballot, and then carefully put the ballot into the ballot box. He said: "I am the master of the country. I must be vigilant and work and study hard to defend the motherland and assume the responsibility of the master of the country." A certain regiment of the Public Security Forces stationed in Guizhou had soldiers from nine ethnic groups. They all voted excitedly. Soldier Zhang Gensheng said after voting: "When the Kuomintang reactionaries were in power, we ethnic minorities had no rights or status. Today, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we can participate in elections and truly become masters of the country."
    The basic-level elections of various units of the Northwest Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have largely concluded. In the election, cadres and soldiers demonstrated a high degree of political enthusiasm for the country and the people. The soldiers said that they wanted to choose the best from the good, and elect the people they trusted the most, and the people who could serve the people the best. Among the elected representatives, there were both cadres and soldiers, and heroic models accounted for a large proportion. A certain unit elected the famous combat hero Ding Xingfa, who had attended the National Combat Heroes Representatives Conference, as a representative to attend the regimental military representatives conference. One of the representatives elected by a certain unit was a cultural instructor of the Second Company of the Artillery Battalion. This cultural instructor was able to integrate with the soldiers in the cultural study movement, wholeheartedly help the soldiers learn culture, and establish meritorious service. One of the representatives elected by a certain unit to attend the local People's Congress was the political instructor of a model company that supports the government and cherishes the people. This instructor himself is a model of supporting the government and cherishing the people.
    The Northeast Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has also largely completed the basic-level elections. Under the leadership of the election committees at all levels, the basic-level units have carried out in-depth general election education and various organizational preparations. Leading cadres of many units personally gave reports to their subordinate units; some units invited responsible cadres of local election committees to give reports to the troops. Air Force units, the Liaodong Military Region, and the Third Military Medical University and other units adopted education methods of lecturing, discussion, and comprehensive answers, linking them to reality, with good results. In addition, various units widely carried out club activities, using lively forms to conduct propaganda and mobilization for the general election. In terms of organizational work, all units generally achieved meticulousness and thoroughness, and when nominating candidates, they generally did so cautiously and carefully, and widely absorbed the opinions of the masses. The cadres and soldiers participating in the election were very enthusiastic and carefully chose the people they were satisfied with to be representatives.

    【新华社十六日讯】中国人民解放军各部队的干部和战士正以极大的政治热情参加普选。目前，有的部队已完全结束了基层选举，有的已大部结束了基层选举。
    中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会直属机关、部队的基层选举已经结束。现各单位正在酝酿选举出席人民革命军事委员会直属机关、部队军人代表大会的代表。在基层选举中，各单位提出的候选人，都经过反复的讨论。在选举的那一天，各机关、部队、学校都呈现出节日景象。所有年满十八岁的革命军人，都穿着整齐清洁的服装，怀着兴奋的心情，慎重地把选票投在票箱里。在医院、疗养院休养的解放军伤病员也投了票。参加选举的人中有许多经历长期革命斗争的干部和战士。他们的心情特别兴奋。参加过红军二万五千里长征的何中财在选举时说：“这光荣权利和解放军的艰苦奋斗分不开的，我们要特别尊重它。”
    中国人民解放军公安部队的普选工作已全面展开，很多单位已完成了基层选举。在选举的那天，同志们把选票拿在手里，都有说不出的激动。如辽东省公安总队战士于成龙，在军人大会上双手接过了选票以后，心就兴奋得跳动起来，他一笔一划地把自己最满意的人的名字写在选票上，又小心地把选票放进了票箱里。他说：“我是国家的主人，我就要提高警惕，努力工作和学习，来保卫祖国，负起国家主人翁的责任来。”驻贵州的公安部队某团中有九种兄弟民族的战士。他们都兴奋地投了票。战士张根生投票以后说：“国民党反动派在的时候，就没有我们少数民族的权利和地位。今天，我们在共产党、毛主席的领导下，才能参加选举，真正成了国家的主人。”
