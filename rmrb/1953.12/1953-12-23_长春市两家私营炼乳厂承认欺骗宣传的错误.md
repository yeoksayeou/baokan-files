    Two Private Condensed Milk Factories in Changchun
    Admit to False Advertising
    Zhou Yingxing, head of the Changchun United Dairy Factory, and Yang Youyi, head of the Changchun Huakang Food Industry Cooperative, wrote: In the past, our two private condensed milk factories, in order to expand sales, used false statements such as "feeding babies with condensed milk is no different from breastfeeding," "suitable for long-term consumption," and "strengthening bones and muscles" on our products to deceive consumers. In fact, condensed milk is not suitable as the main food for infants, as stated in the letter from the Ministry of Health published in the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on October 30: "Generally, condensed milk has a very high sugar content added during the manufacturing process, so when diluted into usable milk, the fat and protein content is very low and cannot meet the nutritional needs of infants.... If infants consume condensed milk for a long time, it will inevitably lead to muscle relaxation, weakness, and lack of resistance, and they are prone to various vitamin deficiencies such as rickets...." After reading the letter from reader Tian Zu'en in the People's Daily, and after criticism from the Changchun Municipal People's Government Health Bureau and the Administration of Industry and Commerce, we realized that the past practice of only caring about personal profit and not considering the health of the next generation, and engaging in deceptive advertising, was wrong. We have published a letter of repentance in the Changchun Xinbao, admitting our mistakes and apologizing to users, and have decided to delete the deceptive wording from our trademarks.

### 长春市两家私营炼乳厂承认欺骗宣传的错误

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    长春市两家私营炼乳厂
    承认欺骗宣传的错误
    长春联合牛乳厂负责人周应兴和长春华康食品工业社负责人杨有义来信：我们两个私营炼乳工厂，过去为了扩大推销，在产品上曾用“如以炼乳育儿与母乳无异”，“长期食用尤为适宜”，“增强骨肉”等虚伪言词欺骗用户。实际上，炼乳并不适宜用作婴儿主要食品，正如人民日报十月三十日
  “读者来信摘要”栏发表的中央卫生部的信中所说：“一般炼乳在制造过程中，加入了很高成分的蔗糖，因而稀释成可用之乳汁时，所含脂肪及蛋白质的成份就非常低，不能满足婴儿营养的需要……。如婴儿长期食用炼乳，必致肌肉松弛、软弱而缺乏抵抗力，并易得各种维生素缺乏症如佝偻病等……。”我们看到人民日报上读者田祖恩的来信，并经长春市人民政府卫生局及工商管理局的批评后，认识到过去那种只顾个人赚钱、不考虑第二代健康而进行欺骗宣传的做法是错误的。我们已在长春新报登了悔过书，承认错误并向用户致歉，决定删除商标上欺骗性的字样。
