    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: US soldiers stationed in Korea are extremely tired of remaining there for a long time, according to United Press reporter John Sack. He said, "American soldiers are already tired of their dull waiting life, tired of playing cards and writing letters at night." "The current tour of duty is sixteen months—sixteen months of monotonous and dispirited life, so much so that many people have committed suicide." At the same time, the number of patients who need psychological treatment due to nervous disorders is "more than during the war." The reporter said: "Even the company commanders don't like sixteen months."

    侵朝美军士兵意气消沉
    据新华社讯：美国合众社记者约翰·萨克透露：美军士兵对于长期留驻朝鲜已感到极端厌烦，他说：“美国士兵们已经厌倦了他们枯燥的坐候生活，厌倦了玩牌写信的夜晚。”“目前值勤是十六个月——十六个月单调无味意气消沉的生活，以致已有不少人自杀。”同时，由于神经不正常而需要给以心理治疗的病人“比战时还多”。这个记者说：“甚至连长们也不喜欢十六个月”。
