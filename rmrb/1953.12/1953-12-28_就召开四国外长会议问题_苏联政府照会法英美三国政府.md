Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 27th: TASS reported that on December 8th, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs received notes of identical content from the governments of France, Britain, and the United States, responding to the Soviet government's note of November 26th regarding the convening of a foreign ministers' meeting.

On December 26th, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered the Soviet government's reply notes to the embassies of France, Britain, and the United States in Moscow.

The full texts of the French government's note of December 8, 1953, and the Soviet government's note of December 26, 1953, are as follows:

French government's note of December 8, 1953:

The French Embassy extends its compliments to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and presents the following note:

The French government is pleased to learn from the Soviet government's note of November 26th that the Soviet Union is now prepared to participate in a four-power foreign ministers' meeting of France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The French government hopes that this meeting will make it possible for Germany to achieve unification under free conditions and for the Austrian treaty to be concluded.

The French government believes that genuine progress in resolving the particularly urgent German and Austrian questions will contribute to the resolution of other important international issues, including the issue of European security. To this end, the French government reiterates that the voluntary association of free nations in the Atlantic Alliance and the actions taken by certain European countries to promote prosperity and ensure common security are purely defensive and constitute a collective contribution to peace.

The Soviet government has expressed its desire to discuss the possibility of holding a five-power conference. At the upcoming four-power foreign ministers' meeting, any participating government may state its views on this issue.

After consultations with the German Federal Government and the German authorities in Berlin, the French government specifically proposes that the four-power foreign ministers' meeting be held on January 4, 1954, at the original site of the Allied Control Council in Berlin.

Soviet government's note of December 26, 1953: The Soviet government has received the French government's reply of December 8th to the Soviet government's note of November 26th of this year. The Soviet government takes into account that the French government has agreed to convene a four-power foreign ministers' meeting of France, the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States in Berlin. The Soviet government reiterates its previously stated views on the issue of convening a foreign ministers' meeting, and the Soviet government views the significance of this meeting in terms of the possibility of easing international tension—provided that all participants have such a desire—and the necessity of guaranteeing European security and eliminating the threat of the revival of German militarism. The Soviet government particularly notes the French government's agreement to discuss the issue of convening a five-power conference with the participation of the People's Republic of China, because a five-power foreign ministers' meeting would naturally greatly promote the resolution of pressing international issues. Considering the necessity of conducting corresponding preparatory work for the foreign ministers' meeting and the importance of providing appropriate conditions for the governments of the participating countries, the Soviet government believes that the most appropriate date for holding such a meeting is January 25, 1954, or any date thereafter. As for the location of the aforementioned meeting, it seems appropriate for the representatives of the four powers' high commissioners in Berlin to resolve it through consultation. The Soviet government has sent notes of identical content to the British and American governments.

    就召开四国外长会议问题
    苏联政府照会法英美三国政府
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十七日电：十二月八日，苏联外交部接到了法、英、美三国政府的内容相同的照会，对苏联政府十一月二十六日关于召开外长会议的照会作了答复。
    十二月二十六日，苏联外交部把苏联政府的复照送交法、英、美三国驻莫斯科大使馆。
    法国政府一九五三年十二月八日的照会和苏联政府一九五三年十二月二十六日的照会全文如下。
    法国政府一九五三年十二月八日的照会：
    法国大使馆谨向苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟外交部致意并提出照会如下：
    法国政府从苏联政府十一月二十六日的照会中欣悉苏联现在准备参加法国、联合王国、美国和苏联四国外长会议。法国政府希望这个会议使德国有可能在自由的条件下获得统一并使对奥和约有可能缔结。
    法国政府相信，在解决特别迫切的德国和奥国问题方面的真正的进展将有助于其他重要国际问题——包括欧洲安全问题的解决。为此，法国政府重申，大西洋联盟自由国家的自愿组合以及某些欧洲国家为促进繁荣和保证共同安全而采取的行动是纯粹防御性的，并且是对和平的集体贡献。
    苏联政府已表示希望讨论举行五大国会议的可能性。在即将举行的四国外长会议上，任何与会国政府都可以陈述它对这个问题的看法。
    法国政府与德意志联邦政府和柏林德国当局磋商后，特建议四国外长会议于一九五四年一月四日在柏林盟国管制委员会原址举行。苏联政府一九五三年十二月二十六日的照会：苏联政府已经收到法国政府十二月八日对苏联政府今年十一月二十六日的照会的复文。苏联政府考虑到，法国政府已经同意在柏林召开法、苏、英、美四国外长会议。苏联政府重申它前已说明的、关于召开外长会议问题的观点，苏联政府是根据缓和国际紧张局势的可能性——只要所有与会者都有这样的愿望——以及保证欧洲安全和消除德国军国主义复活的威胁的必要性来看待这次会议的意义的。苏联政府特别注意到法国政府同意讨论召开有中华人民共和国参加的五大国会议的问题，因为五大国外长会议自然会在极大的程度上促进迫切的国际问题的解决。考虑到为外长会议进行相应的准备工作的必要性以及为各与会国政府提供适当条件的重要性，苏联政府认为，举行这样的会议的最适宜的日期是一九五四年一月二十五日或其后的任何日期。至于举行上述会议的地址问题，似乎宜于由四国驻柏林高级专员的代表协议解决。苏联政府已把内容相同的照会送交英国和美国政府。
