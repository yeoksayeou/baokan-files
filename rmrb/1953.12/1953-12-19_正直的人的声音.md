The "German Construction" magazine published in 1953, issues 3 and 4 combined, carried a letter written by Stephen Hime, author of the novel "The Crusaders" and former U.S. Army Reserve officer, to U.S. President Eisenhower on April 17th of this year. This letter allows us to see from another angle how American war policies are losing popular support! The original letter is translated as follows:

"Sir:

I resign my commission as an officer in the U.S. Army Reserve.

I once served with honor in the American army when it fought for democracy. But I cannot serve in an army that wages the Korean War or the war that the American government announces it is planning. I cannot serve in an army that uses fleas and spiders carrying germs. I cannot serve in an army that fights alongside Nazi war criminals.

Enclosed is my commission, and I also return to you the Bronze Star Medal I received for my service in the Battle of the Bulge during World War II. I cannot keep a medal that has been disgraced by the massacre and unjust war against the Korean people.

Stephen Hime (signature)"

    正直的人的声音
     “德国建设”画报一九五三年第三、四期合刊上，刊载了小说“十字军”作者、曾任美国陆军后备军官的斯蒂芬·希姆今年四月十七日写给美国总统艾森豪威尔的一封信。这封信使我们从另一个角度看到美国的战争政策是如何丧失人心！原信译文如下：“先生：
    我向你辞去美国后备军军官的职务。
    当美国军队为民主而战的时候，我曾经光荣地在其中服役。但是我不能在一个从事朝鲜战争或者美国政府宣布正在策划的战争的军队中服役。我不能在一个使用携带病菌的跳蚤和蜘蛛的军队中服役。我不能在一个与纳粹战犯并肩作战的军队中服役。
    随函附上我的委任状，同时退还给你我在第二次世界大战中因在布尔治战役有功而荣获的古铜星奖章。我不能保存一枚被对朝鲜人民进行的屠杀与非正义战争所辱没的奖章。
      斯蒂芬·希姆（签名）”
