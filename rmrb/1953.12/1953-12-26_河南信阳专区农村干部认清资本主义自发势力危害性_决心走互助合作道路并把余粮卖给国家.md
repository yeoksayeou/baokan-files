    Rural Cadres in Xinyang Prefecture, Henan Province, Recognize the Harm of Spontaneous Capitalist Forces, Determined to Take the Road of Mutual Aid and Cooperation and Sell Surplus Grain to the State
    From November 12th to December 3rd, the county committees of the Chinese Communist Party in Xinyang Prefecture, Henan Province, successively held enlarged meetings of county committees, meetings of party representatives, and enlarged meetings of cadres to convey the general line for the transition period of the state. More than 23,000 cadres attended the meetings, distinguishing the ideological boundaries between socialism and capitalism, recognizing the harm of spontaneous capitalist forces in the countryside, and resolving to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation and actively sell surplus grain to the state.

    At these meetings, the spontaneous capitalist thoughts and behaviors in the countryside were exposed and criticized. Cadres with capitalist thoughts and behaviors, one after another, compared themselves with the general line at the meetings and conducted self-analysis and criticism. Li Tingkai, a representative from the 14th district of Xinyang County, said: "My family has more than 4,000 jin of surplus grain, and I originally wanted to use it to buy farmland and hire long-term laborers. After this meeting, my mind is clear. We can no longer take this capitalist road that makes the majority suffer. I want to take the road to prosperity for everyone. After I go back, I will definitely sell the surplus grain to the state." Guo Shihai, the head of a mutual aid team in the fourth district of Suiping County, said: "In the old society, I begged for food for three years and was a tenant farmer all my life, suffering inhuman hardship. Now that the Communist Party has come, distributed land, and turned me over, I finally have food and clothing, and I want to exploit others. Now that I have studied the general line, I understand that this is asking me to enjoy happiness alone and everyone to suffer. When I go back, I will resolutely improve the mutual aid team and sell all 15,000 jin of surplus grain of the entire team to the state to support the country's industrial construction." Cadres in the 11th district of Xinyang County examined that they not only did not dissuade farmers from taking the capitalist road but instead became the "pioneers" of taking the capitalist road. They felt ashamed of the Party and let down Chairman Mao. They resolved to work hard and earnestly implement the general line.

    While recalling the past and criticizing capitalist ideas, the cadres also summarized the main changes in the countryside in recent years, such as the increase in agricultural production and the improvement of farmers' lives. For example, in Li Lou Township, Xixian County, five new phenomena have emerged after the land reform, namely, more grain harvested after participating in mutual aid teams, more houses built, more city cloth worn, more livestock raised, and more children born. The cadres believed that these were the results of the country's leadership, support, and the farmers taking the road of mutual aid and cooperation.

    Through the comparison of the two roads, the vast number of cadres hated the capitalist road, loved the socialist road, and improved their socialist ideological awareness. The cadres expressed their determination to improve mutual aid and cooperation and sell surplus grain to the state. According to statistics, the cadres attending the meeting reported selling more than 6.68 million jin of grain. At the same time, the vast number of cadres were full of enthusiasm and confidence, guaranteeing to widely publicize the general line to the peasants, so as to "make it known to every household and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people." At present, the whole prefecture has enthusiastically launched the publicity of the general line.

    河南信阳专区农村干部认清资本主义自发势力危害性
    决心走互助合作道路并把余粮卖给国家
    河南省信阳专区各县先后于十一月十二日到十二月三日召开了中共县委扩大会议、党代表会议和扩大干部会议，传达了国家过渡时期的总路线。到会两万三千多干部，分清了社会主义和资本主义的思想界限，认清了农村资本主义自发势力的危害性，决心走好互助合作道路，并把余粮积极卖给国家。
    在这些会议上，揭发和批判了农村自发的资本主义思想和行为。有资本主义思想和行为的干部，在会上纷纷对照总路线，自动进行了分析批判。信阳县第十四区代表李廷恺说：“我家有余粮四千多斤，原想拿来买田地、雇长工。这个会一开，我心里亮堂了。这条使大多数人受苦的资本主义道路再也不能走了，我要走大家富裕的道路。回去后，我一定把多余的粮食卖给国家。”遂平县第四区互助组长郭士海说：“在旧社会，我讨过三年饭，当了一辈子佃户，受的不是人的苦。如今共产党来了，分了地，翻了身，才有了吃穿，就想剥削人家，现在我学习了总路线，明白了这是叫我一个人享福，大家受罪的资本主义道路。我回去坚决搞好互助组，并把全组一万五千斤余粮全部卖给国家，支援国家工业建设。”信阳县第十一区区干部检查他们不但没有劝止农民走资本主义道路，反而当了走资本主义道路的“先行官”，感到有愧于党，对不起毛主席，他们就下决心要努力工作，认真贯彻总路线。
    在回忆过去、批判资本主义思想的同时，干部们还总结了几年来农业生产提高、农民生活改善等农村中主要的变化。如息县李楼乡土地改革后出现了五种新气象，即参加互助组后打的粮食多，盖的房子多，穿的市布多，喂的牲口多，生的孩子多。干部们认为这都是国家领导、扶助和农民们走互助合作道路的结果。
    通过两条道路的对比，广大干部痛恨资本主义道路，热爱社会主义道路，提高了社会主义的思想觉悟。干部们纷纷表示要搞好互助合作，把余粮卖给国家。据统计，参加会议的干部，自报卖粮六百六十八万多斤。同时，广大干部情绪饱满，信心充沛，保证要广泛向农民宣传总路线，作到“家喻户晓，深入人心”。目前，全专区已热烈开展总路线的宣传。
