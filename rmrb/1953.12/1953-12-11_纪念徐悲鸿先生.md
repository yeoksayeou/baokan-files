    In Memory of Mr. Xu Beihong
    Guo Moruo
    Mr. Beihong was a pioneer in China's new art world. Because his father was a painter, he had a deep personal understanding of the cultural heritage of the motherland. And because he studied diligently in France in his early years, he had a genuine grasp of modern Western painting techniques. Precisely because he had such a foundation, Mr. Beihong's paintings were able to integrate the old and the new to create a unique style of his own. In the last ten years or so, he suffered from chronic kidney disease and high blood pressure, which limited his physical strength for creation, preventing him from achieving the greater accomplishments he deserved, which is a regret.
    In addition to painting, Mr. Beihong devoted himself to the cause of art education. His contribution in this area seems even greater. He repeatedly presided over national institutions of higher art education, and most modern Chinese artists have been influenced by him. His educational principles of emphasizing basic training, advocating learning from nature, opposing formalism, and respecting cultural heritage have had a positive impact on the Chinese art world.
    Mr. Beihong was rich in patriotism and a sense of justice. Although he was educated in a capitalist country, and had quite a bit of contact with the upper echelons of the old society in China, especially during the Kuomintang rule, when the reactionaries deliberately tried to use him as a decoration, he was able to remain harmonious without being swept along, and maintained his integrity. This is the fundamental reason why he was able to make contributions in artistic creation and art education.
    In early 1945, the democratic movement reached its climax. People from all walks of life in Chongqing made representations to the Kuomintang authorities, demanding the abandonment of one-party dictatorship, the convening of party conferences, and the establishment of a coalition government. The Chinese literary and art circles also issued a declaration on February 22, signed by 372 people, and Mr. Beihong was one of the signatories. This matter infuriated Chiang Kai-shek, because he did not expect Mr. Beihong and some other people to sign the declaration. After the declaration was issued, the reactionaries exhausted all means to force the signatories to declare their repentance. Many people who refused to repent lost their jobs as a result, and Professor Fei Gong was even assassinated because of this. Although Mr. Beihong was a major target of coercion, he finally stood firm. This past event is enough to show Mr. Beihong's character; he was indeed unwilling to associate with the reactionaries.
    Mr. Beihong made even more significant progress since liberation. He earnestly understood Chairman Mao's instructions at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art in his ideological studies, and prepared with full confidence to use his talents to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. In 1950, despite his illness, he went to the Daoyiling Irrigation Project area in Shandong for two months to experience actual life and prepare for creation. He also did not forget to vigorously improve the work of art education. If his health had allowed, there is no doubt that Mr. Beihong should have had greater achievements.
    Unfortunately, illness finally took away such an artist with a solid foundation and talent, and illness finally took away a friend of the people from the art world.
    We cannot forget Mr. Beihong. We should shoulder the burden he left behind together with greater strength.

    纪念徐悲鸿先生
    郭沫若
    悲鸿先生是中国新美术界的前驱者。由于他的父亲是画家，故对于祖国文化遗产颇有深厚的亲炙。又由于早年赴法国勤苦学习，故对于泰西近代画法复有真切的揣摩。就因有这样的根柢，悲鸿先生的画颇能融会新旧而创立一独自的风格。近十余年为慢性肾脏疾患与高血压症所苦，限制了他的从事创作的体力，使他未能得到应有的更大的成就，是一遗憾。
    悲鸿先生于作画外，复尽瘁于美术教育事业。他在这方面的贡献似乎更大。他曾屡次主持国立高等美术院校，现代中国美术家，大多受过他的熏陶。他的注重基本训练、主张师法造化、反对形式主义、尊崇文化遗产的教育宗旨对中国美术界是发生了良好的影响的。
    悲鸿先生富于爱国心，亦富于正义感。虽然他是在资本主义国家受过教育，和国内旧社会中的上层人物亦颇有往还，特别是在国民党统治时代，反动派更存心利用他作为摆设，但他却能和而不流，有所自守。这是他能在艺术创作上和艺术教育上有所贡献的基本原因。
    一九四五年初，民主运动达到高潮。重庆各界均向国民党当局进言，要求废弃一党专政、召开党派会议、成立联合政府。中国文学艺术界也于二月二十二日发表了宣言，有三百七十二人签名，悲鸿先生也是签名者的一位。这件事情是使蒋介石震怒了：因为他没有料到悲鸿先生和其他一部分人士会在宣言上签名。宣言发表后，反动派曾用尽种种方法迫使签名者声明反汗。不肯反汗者不少人因此失掉职业，如费巩教授则更因此遭了暗杀。悲鸿先生虽然是被迫的一位主要对象，但他终于坚定下来了。这一往事恰足以表示悲鸿先生的性格，他和反动派确实是不肯同流合污的。
    悲鸿先生自解放以来更有显著的进步，在思想学习上认真地体会了毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的指示，满怀信心地准备把自己的才能为工农兵服务。一九五○年曾抱病到山东导沂工程地区去住了两个月，体验实际生活，为创作作准备。对于美术教育工作也未忘记锐意加以改进。假使健康允许，无疑，悲鸿先生是应该有更大的成就的。
    可惜得很，疾病终于夺去了这样有根柢、有才能的艺术家，疾病终于从艺术界中夺去了一位人民的友人。
    我们对于悲鸿先生是不能忘记的。他所遗留下来的担子，我们应该用更大的力量来共同担负起来。
                  一九五三年十一月二十四日
