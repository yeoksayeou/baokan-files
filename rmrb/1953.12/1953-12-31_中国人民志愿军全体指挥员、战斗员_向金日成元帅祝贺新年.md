The full text of the congratulatory telegram is as follows:

    Respected Marshal Kim Il-sung:

    As 1954 approaches, please accept the sincere respect and warm congratulations from all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.

    Under your wise leadership, the heroic Korean people have won a great victory in the war against America, achieved the Korean armistice, and rapidly begun the arduous post-war reconstruction. We, all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, feel infinitely honored to have personally participated in this great struggle and to have done our part in the struggle to defeat our common enemy alongside the heroic Korean People's Army. In the short time since the armistice, we have been infinitely delighted to see the heroic Korean people begin to rebuild their beautiful homeland. Recently, your personal visit to our country and the signing of the Sino-Korean Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement have given us great encouragement. We deeply know that the fighting friendship between our two peoples, cemented with blood, is the guarantee for us to defeat our common enemy. As this new year approaches, and as the enemy is doing its best to obstruct the convening of the political conference and conspiring to forcibly detain prisoners of war, we hereby assure you that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army will continue to stand firmly with the heroic Korean People's Army, more vigilantly guard our positions, strengthen our defenses, and if the enemy dares to provoke and invade, we will resolutely strike back. We firmly believe that the common cause of the Chinese and Korean peoples for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the defense of peace in the Far East will achieve greater victories in the new year! The Korean people's desire to rebuild their peaceful lives will surely be realized!

    We wish you good health in the New Year!

    Long live the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples!

    Long live the heroic Korean people!

    Long live Marshal Kim Il-sung, the wise leader of the Korean people!

        Deng Hua, Yang Dezhi, and all commanders and fighters
                      December 29, 1953
