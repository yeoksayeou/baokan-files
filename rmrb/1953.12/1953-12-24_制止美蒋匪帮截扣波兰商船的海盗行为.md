    Stop the Pirate Actions of the American-Chiang Kai-shek Bandit Gang in Intercepting Polish Merchant Ships

    On October 4th, under the open protection and assistance of the American air and naval forces, the maritime armed forces of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, remnants in Taiwan, illegally intercepted the Polish merchant ship "Praca" on the high seas 125 miles east of Taiwan, which was en route to our country. The ship, its crew, and cargo were detained and have not yet been released. This is a serious incident that blatantly violates international law.

    On October 12th and October 26th, the government of the Polish People's Republic twice sent notes to the U.S. government lodging strong protests against this incident. During the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly on December 4th, representatives of the Soviet Union and Poland and other countries strongly condemned the United States' illegal assistance to the Kuomintang bandit remnants for threatening shipping in the Far East. The Polish representative Katz-Suchy pointed out that the U.S. government must bear serious responsibility for this incident. The Polish government has demanded that the U.S. government take measures to release the "Praca" and its crew, return the cargo, and reserve the right to demand compensation for losses from the U.S. government. The Chinese people firmly support the Polish government's position on this incident and express indignation at the United States' violation of international law.

    According to the universally recognized principle of freedom of navigation, ships of any country may sail on the high seas without being subject to any infringement. The United States' instigation and assistance to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit remnants to intercept the "Praca" is a completely unreasonable act of aggression. An October 8th dispatch from the Associated Press shamelessly stated, "The merchant ship Praca passed through the Bashi Channel between southern Taiwan and the Philippines and was intercepted after slipping into the Pacific Ocean." It also said that the crew members of the intercepted Polish merchant ship "have been arrested by the security authorities." According to this shameless statement, the Pacific Ocean seems to have become an inland sea of the United States, and the United States can attack and intercept ships of other countries at will, and the crew members of these merchant ships must be arrested. Such despicable acts by the U.S. government and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit remnants are no different from the medieval pirates robbing people and goods. Facts show that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit remnants in Taiwan have completely become pirates armed by the United States.

    After the United States instigated and helped the Chiang Kai-shek bandit remnants to intercept Polish merchant ships, it desperately denied its direct involvement in this illegal act. However, everyone knows that Chiang Kai-shek is nothing more than a political corpse, and all military, political, and foreign relations in Taiwan are under the complete control of the United States. In June 1950, the U.S. Truman administration openly announced the armed occupation of Taiwan. After the U.S. Eisenhower administration came to power in 1953, it also claimed that it would use Taiwan to intensify its "blockade" against mainland China. Recently, when the U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Carney visited Taiwan, he openly shouted that Taiwan is a "huge fortress in politics and geography" for the United States, and "it is necessary to strengthen the strength of the U.S. Navy around Taiwan." It can be seen from this that the United States cannot escape its guilt for the illegal act of the Chiang bandits intercepting Polish merchant ships. The Chiang bandit remnants cannot do anything without the support of the U.S. government. Moreover, at the time of intercepting the "Praca," the Chiang bandit remnants were using U.S. armed ships, and a U.S. aircraft with U.S. Air Force markings participated in the interception operation, which is even more undeniable by the United States.

    The United States' instigation of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit remnants to intensify the interception of merchant ships coming to our country is an attempt to salvage its increasingly collapsing so-called "embargo" and "blockade" policy. The United States has instructed the Taiwan pirates to intercept not only Polish merchant ships, but also merchant ships of other countries. Reuters revealed on November 16 that the United States had recently ordered the Chiang Kai-shek bandit remnants again to "attempt to intercept or obstruct ships heading to commercial ports in Communist China." From August to October this year, Taiwan pirates successively intercepted merchant ships from Greece, Finland, Italy, and the United Kingdom. On November 15, the British merchant ship "Hadra Lorne" was also intercepted. In this way, the Taiwan pirates under the instigation and assistance of the United States have seriously threatened the safety of navigation in the Far East, rudely hindered international trade exchanges, and harmed the interests of many countries.

    Therefore, all countries that have been harmed by the U.S. "embargo" policy should not ignore the illegal act of the U.S.-Chiang maritime armed forces intercepting the Polish merchant ship "Praca." If this incident is not properly handled, the United States will inevitably use the Chiang Kai-shek bandit remnants to intensify its pirate activities, threatening international shipping and international trade of many countries. World public opinion must unite to condemn the United States' violation of international law and stop the U.S. government from instigating and assisting the pirate activities of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit remnants.

### 制止美蒋匪帮截扣波兰商船的海盗行为

    制止美蒋匪帮截扣波兰商船的海盗行为
    十月四日，在美国海空军的公然庇护和协助下，台湾国民党残余匪帮的海上武装竟在台湾以东一百二十五英里的公海海面上，非法地对来我国的波兰商船“布拉卡号”实行武装截击，并扣留了“布拉卡号”以及船员和货物，迄今尚未予以释放。这是公然违犯国际法的严重事件。
    十月十二日和十月二十六日，波兰人民共和国政府已就这一事件先后两次照会美国政府，提出强硬抗议。在十二月四日的联合国大会政治委员会上，苏联和波兰等国代表更严正地谴责了美国帮助国民党残余匪帮威胁远东航运的非法行为。波兰代表卡茨—苏希指出，美国政府必须对这一事件负严重责任。波兰政府要求美国政府采取措施来释放“布拉卡号”及其船员，发还货物，并保留向美国政府要求赔偿损失的权利。中国人民坚决支持波兰政府对这一事件所采取的立场，并对美国违犯国际法的行为表示愤慨。
    按照世界公认的航海自由的原则，任何国家的船只都可以在公海上航行，不容受到任何侵犯。美国指使和协助国民党残余匪帮截扣“布拉卡号”，完全是蛮横无理的侵略行动。美联社十月八日的电讯恬不知耻地说：“布拉卡号商船通过台湾南部与菲律宾间的巴士海峡，溜入太平洋后即被截获。”又说，被截扣的波兰商船上的船员“已为治安当局所逮捕”。按照这种无耻的说法，太平洋仿佛变成了美国的内海，只要有其他国家船只，美国就可加以攻击和截获，这些商船上的船员就要被逮捕。美国政府和国民党残余匪帮这种卑鄙行径，和中世纪海盗的抢人越货毫无二致。事实表明，台湾国民党残余匪帮已经完全变成为美国所武装起来的海盗了。
    美国指使和帮助国民党残余匪帮截扣波兰商船后，又拚命否认它和这一非法行为的直接关连。但是，谁都知道，蒋介石不过是一具政治僵尸，台湾的一切军事、政治和对外关系都处于美国的全盘控制之下。一九五○年六月，美国杜鲁门政府曾经公开宣布武装侵占台湾；一九五三年美国艾森豪威尔政府上台后，也曾宣称要利用台湾加紧对我国大陆实行“封锁”；最近美国海军作战部长卡涅到台湾进行活动时，又公开叫喊，台湾是美国“在政治和地理上的巨大堡垒”，“要加强美国海军在台湾周围的力量。”由此可见，对于蒋匪帮截扣波兰商船的非法行为，美国是根本不能逃避其罪责的。国民党残余匪帮如果没有美国政府撑腰，是任何事情也干不了的。何况国民党残匪在截击“布拉卡号”的当时，就是使用的美国武装船只，并有一架带着美国空军标志的美国飞机参加了截击行动，这更是美国无法抵赖的。
    美国指使国民党残余匪帮加紧截击前来我国的商船，是企图挽救其日益垮台的所谓“禁运”和
  “封锁”政策。美国指使台湾海盗不仅截扣波兰的商船，而且也截扣了其他国家的商船。路透社十一月十六日透露，美国近来曾再次命令国民党残余匪帮“试图拦截或阻挠那些前往共产党中国商港的船只”。从今年八月到十月，台湾海盗曾接连地截击了希腊、芬兰、意大利和英国的商船。十一月十五日，英国商船“哈得拉洛号”又被拦截。这样，美国指使和协助下的台湾海盗就严重地威胁了远东航行的安全，粗暴地妨碍了国际间的贸易往来，危害了许多国家的利益。
    因此，对于美蒋海上武装截扣波兰商船“布拉卡号”的非法行为，一切受到美国“禁运”政策损害的国家都不应该漠视。如果这一事件不能得到正当处理，那末美国就必然会利用国民党残余匪帮变本加厉地进行其海盗活动，使许多国家的国际航运和国际贸易受到更大威胁。世界公正舆论必须一致起来谴责美国违犯国际法的行为，制止美国政府指使和协助国民党残余匪帮的海盗活动。
