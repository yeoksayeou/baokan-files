    Staff Members Who Are Grossly Irresponsible with Revolutionary Military Personnel Certificates Should Be Punished

    Guan Yao and Song Yifei from the Civil Affairs Bureau of the Guisui Municipal People's Government, Suiyuan Province, wrote: In September of this year, our bureau contacted the Civil Affairs Section of the Guisui County People's Government to inquire whether the death certificate of revolutionary soldier Li Xiang, sent by the military unit, had been mistakenly sent there. A comrade surnamed An from the Civil Affairs Section of the county said, "We have a pile of them here; take them and check!" As a result, in this pile of certificates accumulated in the county, we not only found Li Xiang's death certificate but also discovered a military family certificate, two revolutionary soldier sacrifice certificates, and three merit commendations that had been mistakenly sent to the county.

    In this pile of certificates accumulated in the county, there were twelve military family certificates, twenty-six sacrifice certificates, and twenty-two merit commendations. Some had been accumulated for almost three years, some were crumpled, and two were even missing their stubs. This long-term and large-scale accumulation of various certificates for revolutionary military personnel by the county has already created a negative political impact. For example, Comrade Yang Shenghua, a volunteer soldier, bravely sacrificed his life on June 5, 1951, and the military unit issued a sacrifice certificate on August 21 of the same year. However, Comrade Ma Xiuying, Yang Shenghua's wife, never received the news and posted a search notice in the People's Daily, and the Organization Department of the Baotou Municipal Committee of the CPC and our bureau wrote letters to inquire with relevant authorities. On July 16 of this year, the military unit reissued an unofficial sacrifice certificate and apologized to Comrade Ma Xiuying. However, this time, we discovered Yang Shenghua's sacrifice certificate in the pile of certificates accumulated by the county. Furthermore, in July 1951, the Civil Affairs Section of the county transferred the sacrifice certificates of revolutionary soldiers Xu Siming and Hao Shihong to our bureau. Our bureau was unable to deliver them and, after posting a search notice, discovered that the families of the two martyrs, Xu and Hao, were both under the jurisdiction of Guisui County. Our bureau immediately returned the certificates and the martyrs' belongings to the Guisui County People's Government for handling; however, until now, the sacrifice certificates of Xu Siming and Hao Shihong are still accumulated in the Civil Affairs Section of Guisui County.

    The above is only a part of what we have seen. We believe that it is extremely wrong for the Civil Affairs Section of the Guisui County People's Government to arbitrarily accumulate various certificates of revolutionary military personnel that have significant political meaning. This shows that they do not attach importance to preferential treatment work. We suggest that the county's leading organs conduct a thorough inspection of the work of the Civil Affairs Section, promptly and appropriately handle the certificates accumulated in the past, and give the relevant personnel certain punishments.

      Editor's Note: The extremely irresponsible attitude of the Civil Affairs Section of the Guisui County People's Government towards the merit commendations, military family certificates, and sacrifice certificates of revolutionary military personnel is intolerable. Revolutionary military personnel gloriously perform meritorious service or bravely sacrifice their lives for the people and the motherland, which is an unsurpassed honor. We should cherish these certificates of honor and promptly convey them to the families of revolutionary military personnel; this is the responsibility of local government staff. However, the Civil Affairs Section of the Guisui County People's Government arbitrarily accumulates, crumples, and even loses these certificates, which is a manifestation of irresponsibility to the people. We hope that the Civil Affairs Section of the Guisui County People's Government seriously treats the readers' criticism and makes a profound self-criticism.

### 应该处分对待革命军人证件严重不负责任的工作人员

    应该处分对待革命军人证件严重不负责任的工作人员
    绥远省归绥市人民政府民政局关耀、宋刈非来信：今年九月间，我局为了查寻部队寄来的革命军人李祥病故证明书的下落，就和归绥县人民政府民政科联系，看是否邮局误寄给该县了。该县民政科一位姓安的同志说：“我们这里有一堆，你们拿去查吧！”结果，我们在该县积压的这堆证明书中不但找到了李祥的病故证明书，同时还找出误寄该县的我市军属证明书一份、革命军人牺牲证明书二份和立功喜报三份。
    在该县积压的这一堆证明书中，有军属证明书十二份，牺牲证明书二十六份，立功喜报二十二份；其中有的积压将近三年，有的已被揉坏，有两份连存根都没有了。该县这样长期地、大批地积压革命军人各种证明书的错误做法，已经造成了不良的政治影响。例如：志愿军杨生华同志于一九五一年六月五日英勇牺牲，部队在同年八月二十一日就发出了牺牲证明书。但是，杨生华同志的爱人马秀英却一直没有得到消息，就在人民日报登报寻找，并由中共包头市委组织部及我局写信询问有关机关。今年七月十六日，部队又补寄了非正式的牺牲证明书，并对马秀英同志作了道歉。但是这次，我们却在该县所积压的证明书中发现了杨生华同志的牺牲证明书。又如，该县民政科在一九五一年七月把革命军人徐四明、郝士宏两同志的牺牲证明书转给我局，我局无法投递，经登报寻找后，才发现徐、郝两烈士家属都在归绥县管辖境内。我局即将证明书及烈士遗物仍退给归绥县人民政府办理；但是直到现在，徐四明、郝士宏两同志的牺牲证明书还积压在归绥县民政科里。
    上面只是我们所看到的一部分情况。我们认为，归绥县人民政府民政科任意积压有重大政治意义的革命军人的各种证明书是非常错误的，这说明他们对优抚工作极不重视。建议该县领导机关切实检查一下民政科的工作，把过去积压的证明书迅速作适当处理，并给有关人员以一定的处分。
      编者按：归绥县人民政府民政科对待革命军人的立功喜报、军属证明、牺牲证明采取极端不负责任的态度是不能容忍的。革命军人为人民、为祖国而光荣立功或英勇牺牲，这是无尚荣誉的。我们应该十分珍惜这些荣誉的证件，及时转达给革命军人的家属，这是地方政府工作人员的责任。但是，归绥县人民政府民政科却将这些证件任意积压、揉坏，甚至丢失，这是对人民不负责任的表现。我们希望归绥县人民政府民政科严肃地对待读者的批评，并作深刻的检讨。
