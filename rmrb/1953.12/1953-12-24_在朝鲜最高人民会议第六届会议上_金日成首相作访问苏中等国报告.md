(Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang) The Pyongyang newspapers published on the 22nd the report made by Premier Kim Il Sung on the 20th at the Sixth Session of the Supreme People's Assembly of North Korea, regarding the work of the North Korean government delegation’s visits to the Soviet Union, China, and various People's Democratic countries.

The report is divided into five parts: (1) The Working Process of the Visit to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; (2) The Working Process of the Visit to the People's Republic of China; (3) The Working Process of the Visit to Fraternal People's Democratic Countries; (4) Prospects for the Restoration and Development of Our Republic's People's Economy and the Improvement of People's Lives in the Future, Associated with the Assistance Given by Various Fraternal Countries; (5) Our Tasks for Post-War Restoration and Construction Associated with the Assistance from Various Fraternal Countries.

Premier Kim Il Sung first pointed out the significance of the glorious victory achieved by the Korean people in the Fatherland Liberation War, during the period from the Fifth Session of the Supreme People's Assembly convened in February 1950 to this session. He said: When we talk about victory, we cannot fail to mention the internationalist support and assistance of the fraternal countries.

After briefly narrating the selfless assistance given by the people of the Soviet Union, China, and various People's Democratic countries to the Korean people during the war, Premier Kim Il Sung said: Our people will never forget this sincere and selfless assistance from the people of the fraternal countries, and will record the example of noble proletarian internationalist assistance in golden letters in the history of our motherland.

Premier Kim Il Sung continued: Today, our Korean people, facing the cities, countryside, industries, transportation, and cultural facilities that have been cruelly destroyed, have deepened their anger and hatred towards the criminals who destroyed all this—the imperialist war instigators from across the ocean and the traitorous Syngman Rhee reactionary bandits—and have strengthened their determination to oppose war, strengthen friendship with the people of all countries, and defend peace.

Today, our people are filled with a firm determination to restore and build the various sectors of our people's economy as soon as possible, improve and raise the people's living standards, build modern new cities on the ruins of the destroyed old cities, and restore and expand the destroyed old factories, manufacturing plants, and various facilities with modern technology, in order to achieve the peaceful unification and independence of the motherland, and make our motherland even more prosperous and beautiful.

The decisive guarantee for achieving these goals is the unwavering will of our people, tempered in the war under the people's political power established in accordance with our country's people's democratic system, their boundless loyalty to the motherland, their patriotic dedication, their active creative spirit, and the continued fraternal assistance of the people of the great Soviet Union, China, and various People's Democratic countries.

Please allow me, at this first Supreme People's Assembly convened after the war, on behalf of all the Korean people, to extend warm congratulations and heartfelt gratitude to the people and governments of the Soviet Union, China, and various People's Democratic countries who have continuously assisted us.

When talking about the working process of the North Korean government delegation's visit to the Soviet Union, Premier Kim Il Sung pointed out: During the talks, the governments of North Korea and the Soviet Union discussed important issues such as further consolidating and developing the friendly relations between North Korea and the Soviet Union, issues related to the peaceful settlement of the Korean question, the rapid restoration and construction of our people's economy, the use of the Soviet government's allocation of one billion rubles, and the repayment of our country's loans. The Soviet government resolved these issues, which are of great significance for our country's restoration, construction, peaceful reunification, and independence, in a direction that would satisfy our demands.

Talking about the working process of the North Korean government delegation's visit to China, Premier Kim Il Sung pointed out: The governments of North Korea and China discussed political and economic issues related to the interests of both countries, and signed the North Korea-China Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement. The government of the People's Republic of China gratuitously donated to our country all the aid materials and expenses for more than three years, and decided to provide 3 trillion yuan (RMB) in aid in 1954, and another 5 trillion yuan (RMB) in aid in the subsequent three years.

When talking about the working process of the North Korean government delegation's visit to various People's Democratic countries, Premier Kim Il Sung said: The people of Czechoslovakia, Poland, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, the Mongolian People's Republic, Albania, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are thousands of kilometers away from our country, but their sincere and profound assistance can be felt by us at any time. In late June of this year, our Republic's government delegation, headed by Minister of Commerce Li Zhouyuan, visited various friendly countries to discuss their post-war economic cooperation with us, especially their assistance in our economic restoration and construction. The delegation visited various friendly countries for about five months, and with the friendly assistance and care of the governments and leaders of various friendly countries, achieved great results.

In his report, Premier Kim Il Sung announced that the government of the Czechoslovak Republic had decided to assist us free of charge in establishing many factories, such as automobile factories, automobile parts factories, and tool factories, to assist us in repairing cement factories and power plants such as Changjin River, Heochun River, and Bujian River, and to send excellent technicians to our country. In addition, it will provide various machinery data and daily necessities in 1954.

The government of the Polish People's Republic will assist us free of charge in establishing locomotive repair factories and passenger and freight car repair factories between 1954 and 1956, assist us in the drainage and renovation of three coal mines, and provide technical assistance, and will provide our country with materials needed for restoration and construction work and stabilizing people's lives free of charge.

The government of the Hungarian People's Republic will assist free of charge in establishing chemical factories, various dye and organic chemical factories, metrology instrument factories, and machine tool manufacturing factories between 1954 and 1957; and will provide our country with various urgently needed materials such as electrical machinery and communication equipment free of charge in 1954, and send technical teams to help us.

The government of the German Democratic Republic will assist us in establishing diesel generator factories, electrical equipment production factories, and publishing and printing factories between 1954 and 1956; and will provide people's daily necessities and factory equipment, machinery, and equipment worth tens of millions of rubles in 1954.

The government of the Romanian People's Republic will provide us with assistance worth 65 million rubles free of charge between 1953 and 1956 to assist our country in establishing cement factories and aspirin factories, and to provide our country with machinery and equipment for brick factories; and will provide us with ten passenger cars, ten 150-horsepower fishing boats, and thirty tank cars that are currently urgently needed, as well as various equipment and general materials.

The government of the Bulgarian People's Republic will provide us with various materials and equipment worth 20 million rubles free of charge between 1954 and 1955, including cotton yarn, cotton fabrics, and window glass, and will provide machinery and equipment needed for wood tools, wood tool factories, and brick making.

The people of the Mongolian People's Republic and Albania are also currently providing our people with huge material and spiritual assistance.

Premier Kim Il Sung then talked about the prospects for restoring and developing the post-war people's economy and improving the people's living standards. He said: In the future, we will restore and expand more than ten factories, power plants, and coal mines, and decide to build dozens of new factories that our country has never had before.

Premier Kim Il Sung said: As for the factories to be newly built, we cannot yet establish large-scale machinery factories that produce various machines. However, in the near future, we will have factories that can produce their own machine tools, electric motors, electric meters, communication equipment, auto parts, tools, pumps, cast pipes, motors, transformers, electric wires, telephone lines, etc., which will create favorable conditions for using our internal forces to supplement and equip new enterprises and further expand and build new factories. We will have a factory with a planned annual output of 6,000 cars for the first time in 1957.

Premier Kim Il Sung said: One of the important characteristics of our country's post-war restoration and construction is the decision to expand many factories in the light industry sector, while building new factories, in order to rapidly improve and raise the living standards of our people. For example, the Pyongyang Textile Factory will be restored and expanded within one or two years to have a textile machine with 60,000 spindles, and its annual output will increase to 50-60 million meters.

We have never had a silk weaving factory until now. Most of the silkworm cocoons produced in our country are exported abroad. We have failed to fully utilize the potential favorable conditions in developing sericulture. However, in the near future, our country will build silk weaving factories and produce tens of millions of meters of silk every year with our own hands.

The dyeing and bleaching factories that the Soviet Union has decided to build for us from 1954 to 1956 will make the large amount of cotton and silk fabrics produced in our country more gorgeous, greatly increasing their value.

The equipment for the rubber shoe factory that our people urgently need has also been decided to be assisted by China this time, and our rubber shoe factory will be greatly expanded, and it will be able to produce 20 million to 25 million pairs of rubber shoes every year.

Not only that, with the equipment imported from China this time, new cloisonné ware, pottery and porcelain factories and glass factories will be newly established and expanded, thereby producing more enamelware, pottery and porcelain, and glassware needed for our people's lives.

Premier Kim Il Sung also said: Our country's food industry will also be greatly developed in the next two or three years. During this period, our country will build a meat processing complex factory that can process 2,000 tons of meat annually and a seafood canning factory that can process 10,000 tons of fish.

Regarding the restoration and development of the rural economy, Premier Kim Il Sung said: In the work of restoring the rural economy after the war, we will receive assistance from various fraternal countries in the form of livestock, agricultural machinery, farm tools, and fertilizers, thereby possessing the conditions to overcome difficulties during the restoration. Kim Il Sung said: Our agriculture must be in step with the industry that already has prospects for rapid development, and develop to a higher stage in the near future.

Premier Kim Il Sung pointed out: These huge and optimistic prospects appearing before us multiply our courage and greatly encourage us to carry out new creative labor and selfless struggles.

Next, Premier Kim Il Sung listed many examples to illustrate that the assistance given to North Korea by the Soviet Union, China, and various People's Democratic countries is essentially different from the so-called "assistance" clamored by the American imperialist war mongers. He pointed out: In South Korea, which is occupied by the United States, due to the colonial policy of the American imperialists who call themselves "helpers," politics, economy, culture, and other aspects have taken the path of destruction from "August 15th" to today. Premier Kim Il Sung emphasized: All of us Korean people do not need such "assistance" at any time.

The last part of Premier Kim Il Sung's report pointed out the tasks of post-war restoration and construction. He said: The international assistance mentioned above has given us favorable conditions to successfully complete the national task of restoring and constructing our people's economy in a short period of time. Now, everything depends on our own ability to organize, lead, create, and practice. Our future achievements depend on how we correctly, reasonably, and effectively utilize these conditions.

Premier Kim Il Sung said: First of all, we must formulate a three-year plan for the restoration and construction of the people's economy, and mobilize all forces to participate in the struggle that will begin in 1954. We must eliminate the laxity and lack of planning in our work, so that we can concentrate, focus, and appropriately and foreseeably carry out our restoration and construction work.

Premier Kim Il Sung successively pointed out the tasks and guidelines for the restoration and construction of industry, agriculture, aquatic industry, railway transportation, cities, cultural and health facilities, housing, and the training of technical cadres and technicians. He then said: In any aspect, we must maximize every possibility we have, vigorously launch and expand the movement to increase production and save, and we must carry out a resolute struggle against the phenomena of wasting labor, materials, financial resources, and food. We must continue to maintain the tense posture during the war in the post-war restoration and construction work, and we must unreservedly give full play to the mass creative spirit and patriotic dedication. We should give the greatest concern to the suggestions and demands of the people, and we must do everything possible for their lives.

Premier Kim Il Sung finally said: I am convinced that all of us people will unite more firmly around the Workers' Party of Korea, the government of the Republic, and under the banner of the Fatherland Unification Democratic Front, victoriously complete our tasks of restoration and construction, turn our motherland into a more prosperous and beautiful country, achieve the peaceful unification of our motherland, and make contributions to the cause of safeguarding lasting peace and security in the Far East and the world.

Premier Kim Il Sung ended his report with the following slogans:

Let us advance everything for the victorious completion of this glorious historical task!

Long live the invincible internationalist friendship and unity of the people of the People's Republic of China and various People's Democratic countries headed by the Soviet Union, and the peace-loving people of the world!

Long live our glorious motherland—the Democratic People's Republic of Korea!

    在朝鲜最高人民会议第六届会议上
    金日成首相作访问苏中等国报告
    【新华社平壤讯】平壤各报二十二日发表了金日成首相二十日在朝鲜最高人民会议第六届会议上所作的关于前往苏联、中国及各人民民主国家访问的朝鲜政府代表团的工作报告。
    报告共分五部分：（一）访问苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的工作经过；（二）访问中华人民共和国的工作经过；（三）访问兄弟般的各人民民主国家的工作经过；（四）和各兄弟国家给予的援助相关联的、今后我们共和国人民经济的恢复和发展与人民生活的改善的展望；（五）和各兄弟国家的援助相关联的我们战后恢复建设的任务。
    金日成首相首先指出在从一九五○年二月召开最高人民会议第五届会议到这次的会议期间，朝鲜人民在祖国解放战争中所取得的光辉胜利的意义。他说：我们在谈到胜利的时候，就不能不提到各兄弟国家的国际主义的支持和援助。
    金日成首相在扼要地叙述了苏联、中国及各人民民主国家人民在战争期间给予朝鲜人民的无私援助之后说：我们人民将永远不会忘记各兄弟国家人民这种诚心诚意的无私援助，并将用金字把崇高的无产阶级国际主义援助的榜样记录在我们祖国的历史上。
    金日成首相接着说：我们朝鲜人民今天面对着被残酷破坏了的城市、农村、产业、运输和文化设施，更加深了对破坏这一切的罪犯——大洋彼岸的帝国主义战争纵火者和卖国贼李承晚反动匪帮的愤怒和仇恨，坚定了反对战争、加强与各国人民的友谊及保卫和平的决心。
    我们人民今天充满了坚强的决心，要早日恢复和建设我们人民经济的各部门，改善和提高人民的生活，在被破坏了的旧城市废墟上建设起现代化的新城市，用现代化的技术恢复和扩大遭受破坏的旧工厂、制造所及各种设施，以实现祖国的和平统一与独立，使我们祖国变得更加富强、更加美丽。
    实现这些的决定性的保证，就是我们人民在依照我们国家的人民民主制度而建立的人民政权下，在战争中锻炼出来的坚定不移的意志，对祖国的无限忠诚，爱国献身精神和积极的创造精神，以及伟大的苏联、中国和各人民民主国家人民继续不断的兄弟般的援助。
    请让我在这战后首次召开的最高人民会议上，以全朝鲜人民的名义，向不断援助我们的苏联、中国和各人民民主国家人民及其政府致以热烈的祝贺和衷心的感谢。
    金日成首相在谈到朝鲜政府代表团访问苏联的工作经过时指出：朝苏两国政府在会谈中讨论了进一步巩固发展朝苏友好关系、与朝鲜问题的和平解决有关问题、迅速恢复建设我国人民经济、苏联政府拨款十亿卢布的使用以及我国贷款的偿还等重要问题。对于我国的恢复建设与和平统一、独立有重大意义的这些问题，苏联政府都向着满足我们要求的方向予以解决了。
    谈到朝鲜政府代表团访问中国的工作经过，金日成首相指出：朝中两国政府在会谈中讨论了有关朝中两国利益的政治及经济问题，并签订了朝中经济及文化合作协定。中华人民共和国政府无偿地赠送我国以三年多以来的一切援助物资和费用，并决定在一九五四年度给予三万亿元（人民币）的援助，在其后的三年内再给予五万亿元（人民币）的援助。
    金日成首相在谈到朝鲜政府代表团访问各人民民主国家的经过时说：捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、德意志民主共和国、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、蒙古人民共和国、阿尔巴尼亚和越南民主共和国等国人民，距离我国有数千公里之远，但是，他们诚挚而深厚的援助，是我们在任何时候都能够感受到的。今年六月下旬，以商业相李周渊同志为团长的我们共和国政府代表团前往各友邦国家，讨论他们和我们在战后的经济合作问题，特别是他们援助我们进行经济恢复建设的问题。代表团访问各友邦国家约五个月，在各友邦国家的政府及其领导者的友好协助和关怀下，取得了巨大的成果。
    金日成首相在报告中宣布捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府决定无偿地协助我们建立汽车工厂、汽车零件工厂、工具工厂等许多工厂，协助我们修复水泥工厂和长津江、虚川江、赴战江等发电厂，并派优秀的技术人员到我国来。此外，并将在一九五四年提供各种机械资料及人民生活必需品。
    波兰人民共和国政府将在一九五四年—一九五六年间，无偿地协助我们建立火车的机车修理工厂、客货车修理工厂，协助我们进行三个煤矿的排水和改造工程，和给予技术援助，并无偿地给我国输入恢复建设工作和安定人民生活所需要的物资。
    匈牙利人民共和国政府将在一九五四年—一九五七年间，无偿地协助建立化学工厂，各种染料及有机化学工厂、度量衡器工厂、工作机械制作工厂等；并在一九五四年内，无偿地给我国输入电气机械、通讯器材等各种急需物资、并派遣技术队来帮助我们。
    德意志民主共和国政府将在一九五四年—一九五六年间，协助我们建立柴油发电机工厂、电气器材生产工厂、出版印刷工厂等；并在一九五四年内，给予价值相当于数千万卢布的人民生活必需品和工厂设备、机械器材等。
    罗马尼亚人民共和国政府在一九五三年—一九五六年间，无偿地给予我们价值相当于六千五百万卢布的援助，用来协助我国建立水泥工厂和阿斯匹灵工厂，给我国输入制砖工厂的机械设备；并给予目前我国急需的客车十辆、一百五十马力的渔船十艘、油槽车三十辆，此外还给予各种器材和一般物资等。
    保加利亚人民共和国政府将在一九五四年—一九五五年间，无偿地给予我们以价值相当于二千万卢布的各种物资和设备，其中包括棉纱、棉织物、窗玻璃等，并给予木材用具、木材用具工厂和制砖所需的机械设备等。
    蒙古人民共和国，阿尔巴尼亚等国人民，目前也正在给予我们人民以巨大的物质上和精神上的援助。
    金日成首相接着谈到今后恢复和发展战后人民经济与改善人民生活的展望，他说：今后我们要恢复并扩建十多个工厂、发电厂和煤矿，并决定新建数十个我国过去未曾有过的工厂。
    金日成首相说：就将要新建的工厂来说，我们还不能建立生产各种机械的大规模的机械工厂。但是，我们在不久的将来，便将具有能够自己生产工作母机、电动机、电表、通讯器材、汽车零件、工具、抽水机、铸管、马达、变压器、电线、电话线等的工厂，这将创造有利的条件，以便利用我们的内部力量来补充和装备新企业，进一步扩建和新建工厂。我们将在一九五七年度第一次具有预定年产六千辆汽车的工厂。
    金日成首相说：我国战后恢复建设的重要特点之一，就是决定扩展轻工业部门的许多工厂，同时建设新的工厂，以迅速改善和提高我们人民的生活。例如：平壤纺织工厂在一、二年内就将恢复和扩展到能够具有六万纱锭的纺织机，同时其年产量将增加到五、六千万公尺。
    我们到现在一直没有绢织工厂。我国所生产的蚕茧大部分向国外输出。我们在发展养蚕业中，未能充分利用潜在的有利条件。但是，在最近的将来，我国将建设绢织工厂，用我们的手来每年生产数千万公尺的绸子。
    苏联决定在一九五四年到一九五六年给我们建设的染色工厂和漂白工厂，使我国将大量生产的棉织物及绢织物更加华丽，以大大提高其使用价值。
    我们人民所迫切需要的胶鞋工厂的设备也在这次决定从中国得到援助，大量扩展我们的胶鞋工厂，每年能够生产胶鞋二千万到二千五百万双。
    不但如此，用这次由中国输入的设备，来新设和扩建景泰蓝器、陶磁器工厂和玻璃工厂、从而将多多生产我们人民生活所需要的搪磁器、陶磁器和玻璃器。
    金日成首相又说：我国的食品工业也将在最近二、三年内得到很大的发展。在这期间，我国将建设每年能够加工两千吨肉类的肉类综合工厂和能够加工一万吨鱼类的海鱼罐头工厂。
    在恢复和发展农村经济方面，金日成首相说：我们在战后农村经济的恢复工作中，将从各兄弟国家得到畜力、农业机械、农具、肥料等援助，从而具备在恢复途中能够突破难关的条件。金日成说：我们的农业要和已经有了迅速发展前途的工业步调一致，在最近将来发展到更高的阶段。
    金日成首相指出：出现在我们面前的这些庞大的和乐观的展望，使我们的勇气百倍，大大鼓舞着我们进行新的创造性劳动和忘我的斗争。
    接着金日成首相列举了许多实例，说明苏联、中国和各人民民主国家所给予朝鲜的援助，和美帝国主义战争贩子们叫嚣的所谓“援助”有着本质上的不同。他指出：在美国强占下的南朝鲜，由于自称为“援助者”的美帝国主义者的殖民政策，从“八·一五”到今天，政治、经济、文化等各方面都走上了灭亡之途。金日成首相着重地说：我们全体朝鲜人民无论什么时候也不需要这样的“援助”。
    金日成首相报告的最后一部分指出了战后恢复建设的任务。他说：以上所说的国际援助使我们有了有利的条件，得以胜利完成在短期内恢复和建设我国人民经济的全民性的任务。现在，一切都在于我们自己组织、领导、创造及实践的能力如何了。我们今后的成果如何，就在于我们怎样正确而最合理、有效地来利用这些条件了。
    金日成首相说：我们首先要制订人民经济恢复建设的三年计划，动员全部力量参加将从一九五四年开始的斗争。我们要清除工作中的散漫性和无计划性，使能集中地、有重点地、适当而有预见地进行我们的恢复建设工作。
    金日成首相依次指出了恢复和建设工业、农业、水产业、铁道运输业、都市、文化保健设施、住宅、培养技术干部及技工等工作的任务和方针。他接着说：我们不论在哪一方面，都必须最大限度地利用我们的每一分可能性，有力地展开并扩大增产节约运动，必须和浪费劳动力、资材、财力、粮食等现象进行坚决的斗争。我们必须在战后的恢复建设工作中，继续坚持在战争期间的紧张姿态，必须毫无保留地发挥群众性的创造精神和爱国主义献身精神。我们应当对人民大众的建议和要求给予最大的关心，并必须为他们的生活而尽一切努力。
    金日成首相最后说：我确信：我们全体人民将更加坚强地团结在朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府的周围和祖国统一民主主义战线的旗帜下，胜利地完成我们恢复建设的任务，把我们的祖国变为更加富强、更加美丽的国家，实现我们祖国的和平统一，对保障远东及全世界的持久和平与安全的事业有所贡献。
    金日成首相以如下的口号结束了他的报告：
    一切为了胜利地完成这一光荣的历史性的任务而前进吧！
    以苏联为首的中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家的人民以及全世界爱好和平人民的必胜不败的国际主义友谊团结万岁！
    我们光荣的祖国——朝鲜民主主义人民共和国万岁！
