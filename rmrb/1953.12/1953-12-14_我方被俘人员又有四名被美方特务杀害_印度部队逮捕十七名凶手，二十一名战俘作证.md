Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 13th: According to a communiqué from the Indian Custodial Forces, four more Korean People's Army prisoners of war who requested repatriation were brutally murdered by U.S. secret agents at the Tongjang-ri POW camp on the evening of December 12th. When the Indian Custodial Forces conducted an investigation at the camp this morning, twenty-one POWs voluntarily came forward to testify, and seventeen murderers were arrested on the spot. To date, the total number of prisoners of war requesting repatriation known to have been murdered, based on reports from the Indian Custodial Forces and returning personnel, has reached nineteen.

An Indian source said that the bodies of these four victims showed they had been beaten and strangled to death.

The communiqué stated that at approximately 7:00 PM on the evening of December 12th, a Korean POW climbed over the wire fence of Camp E-38, requesting repatriation. "Half an hour later, four bodies were found near the camp's wire fence."

During the investigation, POWs were ordered to come to the open area between the wire fences in groups of twenty-five. The communiqué said that after the first group of POWs came out, "one POW voluntarily came forward to report the situation." Shortly thereafter, twenty more POWs also came forward to testify and identified seventeen murderers. These witnesses have been placed in isolation.

The communiqué stated that General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, was present during the later stages of the investigation and expressed strong condemnation of the crime.

To date, the acts of murder perpetrated by secret agents at the Tongjang-ri POW camp to intimidate POWs and prevent them from requesting repatriation, have included bashing in heads, starvation, strangulation, hanging, and beating to death. The case of Zhang Zilong, a captured soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army from Camp 28, who was brutally murdered, occurred on October 3rd; at that time, secret agents burned his body, drove an iron nail into his skull, and cut the flesh off his body piece by piece. They then cut open his chest and removed his heart and liver. In an "hospital" managed by the Americans, a captured soldier of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army named Zhang Liutai was murdered by secret agents after being starved for two days.

    我方被俘人员又有四名被美方特务杀害
    印度部队逮捕十七名凶手，二十一名战俘作证
    【新华社开城十三日电】据印度看管部队公报，又有四名要求遣返的朝鲜人民军被俘人员在十二日晚在东场里战俘营惨遭美方特务杀害。印度看管部队今日早上在营场进行调查时，有二十一名战俘自动出来作证，有十七名凶手当场被逮捕。到目前为止，由于印度看管部队和归来人员的报告而得悉的被杀害的要求遣返的战俘总数已达十九名。
    一位印度人士说，从这四名被害者的尸体上可以看出他们是被打死和勒死的。
    公报说，约在十二日晚七时，有一名朝鲜战俘爬过E三十八号营场的铁丝网，要求遣返。“半小时以后，营场铁丝网附近就发现了四具尸体。”
    在进行调查的时候，战俘奉命二十五人一组走到铁丝网之间的空场上来。公报说，在第一组战俘出来之后，“一名战俘自动出来报告情况”。接着不久，又有二十名战俘也走出来作证，并指出了十七名凶手。这些证人已经被隔离看管。
    公报说，中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军曾在调查的后一阶段到场观看，他对这一罪行表示强烈的谴责。
    到现在为止，特务们在东场里战俘营用来恫吓战俘、使他们不敢要求遣返的谋杀罪行，已经知道的包括打破脑袋、饿死、勒死、吊死和打死。二十八号营场中国人民志愿军被俘人员张子龙惨遭杀害的案件，发生在十月三日；当时特务用火烧他的身体，把一根铁钉钉进他的头骨，一块一块地把他身上的肉割下来。他们然后把他的胸部剖开，取出他的心肝。在美国人管理的“医院”内，有一个名叫张六泰的中国人民志愿军被俘人员在饿了两天以后被特务杀害。
