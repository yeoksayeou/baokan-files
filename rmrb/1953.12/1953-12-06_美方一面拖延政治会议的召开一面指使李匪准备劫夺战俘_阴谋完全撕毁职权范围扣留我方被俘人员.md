Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 3rd. Our special correspondent reports: The U.S. side is now, on the one hand, doing its utmost to delay the convocation of the Korean political conference, and on the other hand, actively supporting the Syngman Rhee bandit gang in preparing for armed seizure of prisoners of war, attempting to intensify the undermining of the foundation of the Korean armistice and completely tear up the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission." This major conspiracy of the U.S. side has increasingly attracted serious attention.

	The "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" is an achievement of the Korean and Chinese side through major efforts to realize the Korean armistice desired by the people of the world and to ensure the repatriation rights of prisoners of war. Because the thorough implementation of the "Terms of Reference" would lead to the failure of the U.S. side's conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war, the U.S. side has consistently made every effort to sabotage it, attempting to make it a scrap of paper. As early as April of this year, when our side initially proposed a plan for resolving the prisoner of war issue, the U.S. representative Harrison put forward an absurd "counter-proposal," attempting to forcibly detain two-thirds of the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army, who were not directly repatriated, under the name of "on-the-spot release." It was only due to our side's stern rebuttal and the strong pressure of world public opinion that the U.S. side had to reach an agreement on the "Terms of Reference" based on our plan.

	Only ten days after the "Terms of Reference" was signed, the U.S. side brazenly disregarded the solemnly signed agreement and condoned the Syngman Rhee bandit gang in forcibly detaining 27,000 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army under the name of "release," escorted by the Syngman Rhee constabulary to the Lee's puppet army training center, forcing them to serve as cannon fodder. Afterwards, the U.S. side, on the one hand, tried its best to shirk its responsibility, and on the other hand, ordered its own troops not to pursue the prisoners of war back from the Syngman Rhee bandit gang. This treacherous act by the U.S. side, which caused an uproar in world public opinion, prolonged the Korean war by more than a month.

	After this, the U.S. side actively began preparing to sabotage the explanatory work, attempting to make the relevant clauses in the "Terms of Reference" impossible to implement. The U.S. side openly dispatched special agents of the Syngman Rhee and Kuomintang bandit gangs to the prisoner of war camps to carry out activities, strengthened the special agent terrorist organizations controlling the prisoners of war under U.S. supervision, forced the prisoners of war to conduct exercises to sabotage the explanatory work, murdered prisoners of war who demanded repatriation, and prepared a large number of weapons for disruption and sabotage.

	After the prisoners of war were transferred to the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the U.S. side again used a series of unreasonable troubles to obstruct the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission from exercising its functions and powers, and stepped up directing the Li and Chiang special agents to sabotage the explanatory work.

	The U.S. side barbarously interfered with the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, fearing that the result of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's impartial implementation of the "Terms of Reference" would prevent the U.S. side from realizing its conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war. After the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission took over the prisoners of war, it discovered that the U.S. side had not told the prisoners of war the content of the "Terms of Reference" as stipulated in the "Terms of Reference," but instead deliberately distorted it. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission therefore had to issue a proclamation to the prisoners of war, explaining the truth. This was originally the due function of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, but Hamblen, the head of the U.S. "Anti-Repatriation Group," immediately came out to interfere, accusing the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission of being "unfair." He blatantly expressed the reason for his dissatisfaction, saying that although this proclamation "did not seriously violate the literal meaning of the Terms of Reference," its "impact is undoubtedly focused on the desire for repatriation." The U.S. side's intention to forcibly detain prisoners of war has been thoroughly exposed here. Then, the U.S. side attempted to overturn the provisions on explanatory work in the "Terms of Reference," preventing the prisoners of war from having the opportunity to listen to explanations. Hamblen openly wrote to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, making various unreasonable demands that violated the "Terms of Reference." He demanded that prisoners of war could individually or collectively refuse explanations; explanations should be conducted in groups of twenty-five people, and also demanded that the explanation representatives "cannot ask questions," but only "provide answers to inquiries," while the prisoners of war could "remain silent." Hamblen also openly demanded that U.S. representatives be allowed to interrupt the explanatory work at will. All this was nothing more than to make the prisoners of war lose the opportunity to listen to explanations and demand repatriation. After the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission adopted "Rules of Procedure" that basically conformed to the "Terms of Reference," the U.S. side expressed "dissatisfaction" in many ways, and launched a massive attack on the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, especially the Chairman of the Commission, India.

	Due to the unreasonable demands made by the U.S. side on the explanatory work procedures, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission had to postpone the date of the start of the explanations to October 1, and decided that because the date of the start of the explanations was delayed, the principle of extending the explanation period should also be followed. The U.S. side refused to accept the decision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, opposed extending the explanation period, and deliberately delayed the construction of explanation tents in order to further shorten the explanation period and buy time to direct the special agents in the camp to arrange methods to sabotage the explanation work in accordance with the provisions of the "Rules of Procedure." Due to this deliberate delaying behavior of the U.S. side, the explanation work of the Korean and Chinese side did not begin until October 15.

	From the time the prisoners of war were handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission until now, the U.S. side has openly violated the provisions in the "Terms of Reference" that prisoners of war should not be coerced by force, intensified the persecution of prisoners of war by directing special agents in the camp, and once again massively forced prisoners of war to tattoo characters and write blood letters, murdering and torturing prisoners of war who demanded repatriation. The U.S. side also instructed special agents to use various terrorist means to coerce prisoners of war not to demand repatriation and prevent prisoners of war from leaving the camp to listen to explanations, so that the explanation work of the Korean and Chinese side has only been carried out for seven days since October 15. This serious crime of the U.S. side in undermining the armistice agreement has been confirmed by the reports of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the accusations of the repatriated Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, and the secret instructions and radio receivers of the U.S. special agents intercepted by the Indian custodial forces.

	The U.S. side's unscrupulous behavior in undermining the "Terms of Reference" has caused the explanation work of the Korean and Chinese side to be suspended for a long time. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has also been paralyzed due to the sabotage of the U.S. side and unable to perform its due functions, but despite the U.S. side's use of all despicable and shameless means to prevent prisoners of war from having the opportunity to listen to explanations and demand repatriation, and not allowing prisoners of war to demand repatriation, up to now, more than two hundred prisoners of war have still broken through the control of the U.S. special agents or returned after listening to the explanations. Their return has completely exposed the U.S. side's conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war, and has caused the inhuman American aggressors to suffer a complete political and moral failure. The U.S. side is now attempting to undermine the armistice agreement and completely tear up the "Terms of Reference" by encouraging Syngman Rhee to seize prisoners of war by force in order to salvage its failure. But no conspiracy of the U.S. side can absolutely conceal the shameful mark of "forcible detention of prisoners of war" that has been engraved on the face of the American aggressors.

### 美方一面拖延政治会议的召开一面指使李匪准备劫夺战俘  阴谋完全撕毁职权范围扣留我方被俘人员

    美方一面拖延政治会议的召开一面指使李匪准备劫夺战俘
    阴谋完全撕毁职权范围扣留我方被俘人员
    【新华社开城三日电】本社特派记者报道：美方现在一方面竭力拖延朝鲜政治会议的召开，一方面积极支持李承晚匪帮进行武装劫夺战俘的准备，企图变本加厉地破坏朝鲜停战的基础，彻底撕毁“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”。美方的这一重大阴谋，已经越来越引起人们的严重注意。
      “中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”是朝中方面为实现世界人民渴望的朝鲜停战、保障战俘的遣返权利、以重大的努力取得的成果。由于“职权范围”的彻底实施将使美方强迫扣留战俘的阴谋遭到失败，因此美方一贯竭力进行破坏，企图使它成为一张废纸。早在今年四月间，当我方最初提出关于解决战俘问题的方案时，美方代表哈利逊就曾经提出荒谬的“对案”，企图以“就地释放”为名强迫扣留占不直接遣返战俘总人数三分之二的朝鲜人民军被俘人员。只是由于我方的严正驳斥和全世界舆论的强大压力，才使美方不得不在我方方案的基础上达成了“职权范围”这一协议。
    在“职权范围”签字以后才过了十天，美方就悍然不顾刚签订的庄严协议，纵容李承晚匪帮以“释放”为名强迫扣留了两万七千名朝鲜人民军被俘人员，由李承晚宪兵押解到李伪军训练中心去，强迫他们充当炮灰。事后美方一方面竭力推卸自己的责任，一方面又下令自己的部队，不许他们向李承晚匪帮追回战俘。美方这一使全世界舆论哗然的背信弃义的行为，使朝鲜流血战争延长了一个多月。
    在这以后，美方就积极着手破坏解释工作的准备，企图使“职权范围”中的有关条款无法实施。美方公开派遣李承晚和国民党匪帮的特务分子到战俘营中去进行活动，在美方监督下加强了控制战俘的特务恐怖组织，强迫战俘进行破坏解释工作的演习，杀害要求遣返的战俘，并且准备了大批为进行捣乱和破坏之用的武器。
    在战俘移交中立国遣返委员会看管以后，美方又以一系列的无理取闹来阻挠中立国遣返委员会行使其职权，并加紧指挥李、蒋特务来破坏解释工作。
    美方对中立国遣返委员会的工作横暴地加以干涉，唯恐中立国遣返委员会公正执行“职权范围”的结果，会使美方不能实现其强迫扣留战俘的阴谋。中立国遣返委员会在接管战俘以后，发现美方没有按照“职权范围”的规定把“职权范围”的内容告诉战俘，却反而故意加以曲解。中立国遣返委员会因此不得不对战俘发表了一个文告，说明真相。这本来完全是中立国遣返委员会应有的职权，美方
  “反对遣返组”组长汉布伦却立即出来干涉，指责中立国遣返委员会“不公正”。他露骨地表示了他的不满的原因，说这个文告虽然“并没有严重地违反职权范围的字面的意义”，但它的“影响无疑是着重于遣返的愿望”。美方强迫扣留战俘的居心，在这里已经彻底暴露。接着美方又企图推翻“职权范围”中关于解释工作的规定，不让战俘有听取解释的机会。汉布伦公开写信给中立国遣返委员会，提出种种违反“职权范围”的无理要求。他要求战俘可以个别或集体拒绝解释；解释要以二十五个人为一组进行，还要求解释代表“不能发问”，仅限于“对询问提出答复”，而战俘又可以“保持沉默”。汉布伦还公然要求允许美方代表可以随意中断解释工作。这一切都无非是为了使战俘丧失听取解释要求遣返的机会。在中立国遣返委员会通过了基本上符合于“职权范围”的“工作细则”以后，美方又多方表示“不满”，并且对中立国遣返委员会、特别是委员会的主席印度大肆攻击。
    由于美方对解释工作程序提出无理要求，中立国遣返委员会不得不将解释开始的日期延到十月一日，并决定由于解释工作开始的日期延迟，解释期限也应顺延的原则。美方一方面拒绝接受中立国遣返委员会的决定，反对顺延解释期限，一方面又故意拖延修建解释帐篷，以便进一步缩短解释期限，并争取时间指挥营场内的特务针对“工作细则”的规定布置破坏解释工作的方法。由于美方这种蓄意拖延的行为，使朝中方面的解释工作，一直到十月十五日才得以开始。
    从战俘移交给中立国遣返委员会起，一直到现在，美方公然违反“职权范围”中关于不得以武力胁迫战俘的规定，变本加厉地指挥营场中的特务迫害战俘，又一次大规模强迫战俘刺字、写血书，谋杀和酷刑拷打要求遣返的战俘。美方并指使特务以种种恐怖手段胁迫战俘不得要求遣返，阻止战俘出营场听取解释，使朝中方面的解释工作从十月十五日以来只进行了七天。美方的这种破坏停战协定的严重罪行，已经为中立国遣返委员会的报告、遣返归来的朝中被俘人员的控诉、以及被印度看管部队截获的美方特务的秘密指令和无线电收报机所证实。
    美方肆无忌惮地破坏“职权范围”的行为，已经使朝中方面的解释工作长期停顿。中立国遣返委员会也由于美方的破坏而陷于瘫痪，无法执行其应有的职权，但是尽管美方用尽一切卑鄙无耻的手段不使战俘有听取解释要求遣返的机会，不许战俘要求遣返，到现在为止，仍然有二百多名战俘突破了美方特务的控制或在听取解释时遣返归来。他们的归来已经使美方强迫扣留战俘的阴谋全盘败露，使惨无人道的美国侵略者在政治上和道义上遭到彻底的失败。美方现在企图用鼓励李承晚武装劫夺战俘的手段来破坏停战协定，彻底撕毁“职权范围”，以挽救自己的失败。但是美方的任何阴谋，绝对掩饰不了已经刻在美国侵略者脸上的“强迫扣留战俘者”的可耻烙印。
