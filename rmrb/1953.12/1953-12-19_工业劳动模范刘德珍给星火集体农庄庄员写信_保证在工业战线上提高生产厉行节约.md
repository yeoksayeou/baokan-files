Industrial Labor Model Liu Dezhen Writes to Members of the Spark Collective Farm
Guaranteeing Increased Production and Strict Economy on the Industrial Front

Dear Comrades of the Spark Collective Farm:

As we approach the second year of the motherland's first Five-Year Plan – 1954 – I, on behalf of all the staff and workers of the Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant, extend to you our heartfelt congratulations.

What was once known as "Beida Huang" has, through your three years of collective labor, been transformed into a beautiful paddy field of over 200 hectares, creating an unprecedented bumper harvest record of over 12,000 jin of rice per hectare. This superior achievement, unseen in history, has greatly inspired our enthusiasm for production, making us even more energetic in our work.

In 1953, under the leadership of the Party, all our staff and workers actively studied the Soviet Union and diligently researched, completing the annual power generation task one month ahead of schedule, ensuring the electricity supply for the capital. The Beijing Electric Power Bureau and Power Plant have, up to the end of October, increased production and saved 21.7 billion yuan for the state, exceeding the annual plan by 7 billion yuan. In addition to production tasks, we have also cultivated a large number of technical talents for the country. Since liberation, we have sent half of the total number of cadres and technical workers in the plant to establish new power plants and work all over the country.

Workers and peasants are brothers with flesh and blood connections, close comrades-in-arms jointly building socialism. Industry and agriculture are inseparable, like two legs of a person; neither can be missing. In order to industrialize the motherland, you increased the grain sold to the state from 1.62 million jin to 1.86 million jin in 1953. This greatly supported industrial construction, enabling the smelting of more steel and iron, and the manufacture of more machines. On the industrial front, we must work even harder to increase production and practice strict economy, accumulate more funds for the country, and send the electricity we generate to agricultural machinery factories to manufacture more and better new agricultural tools to support agricultural production. In this way, the continuous development of industry and agriculture will create a material foundation for socialism. I remember when I visited the Soviet Union during the "May Day" Labor Day in 1952, I saw the Soviet people working hard to build a happy socialist paradise. Take the Moscow University building, which was under construction at the time, for example. It has thirty-eight floors, is four hundred meters high, and has a volume of two million six hundred thousand cubic meters. Such a solemn and magnificent building cannot be built without a strong material foundation.

Comrades of the entire farm: Chairman Mao's general line illuminates our path forward like a lighthouse. Let us join hands and strive together to build a strong material foundation for socialism! We will create more achievements on the industrial production front in 1954; at the same time, we hope to constantly hear news of your glorious victories.

    工业劳动模范刘德珍给星火集体农庄庄员写信
    保证在工业战线上提高生产厉行节约亲爱的星火集体农庄的全体庄员同志们：
    在祖国的第一个五年计划的第二年——一九五四年即将到来的时候，我代表北京石景山发电厂全体职工向同志们致以衷心的祝贺。
    从前人称“北大荒”的地方，经过同志们三年来集体劳动，已变为一片二百多垧的美丽稻田，并创造了每垧产稻谷一万二千多斤空前的丰收纪录。这个历史上没有见过的优越成绩，大大地鼓舞了我们的生产热情，使我们干起活来更有劲了。
    我们全厂职工在一九五三年度里，在党的领导下，积极学习苏联，刻苦钻研，已提前一个月完成了全年发电任务，保证了首都用电。我们北京电业局、发电厂截止到十月底已为国家增产节约二百一十七亿元，超过全年计划七亿元。除去生产任务以外我们还为国家培养了大批技术人材，从解放到现在我们输送了占全厂职工总数一半的干部和技术工人，到全国各地建立起新的发电厂工作。
    工人和农民是血肉相连的兄弟，是共同建设社会主义的亲密战友。工业和农业是不可分离的，就像一个人的两条腿，缺了那条也不行。为了祖国工业化，在一九五三年你们卖给国家的粮食，由一百六十二万斤增加到一百八十六万斤。这就大大的支援了工业建设，能够更多炼钢炼铁，更多制造机器。我们在工业战线上，一定要更加劲提高生产，厉行节约，为国家积累更多的资金，并把我们发出的电送到农业机械厂，制造更多更好的新农具，支援农业生产。这样工业和农业不断的发展，就为社会主义创造了物质基础。记得我在一九五二年“五一”劳动节时到苏联去参观，看见了苏联人民辛勤劳动建立起幸福的社会主义乐园。就拿当时正在修建的一座莫斯科大学的大楼来说，它有三十八层，高四百公尺，体积二百六十万立方公尺，这样庄严雄伟的建筑物，如果没强大的物质基础是做不到的。
    全体庄员同志们：毛主席的总路线像灯塔一样照耀着我们前进的道路，让我们携起手来为建设社会主义的强大的物质基础共同奋斗吧！我们将要在一九五四年的工业生产战线上创造出更多的成绩；同时也希望不断地听到你们的辉煌胜利的消息。
    全国工业劳动模范  石景山发电厂汽机场主任  刘德珍
