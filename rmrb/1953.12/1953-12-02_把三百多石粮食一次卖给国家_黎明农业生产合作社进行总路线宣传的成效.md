Selling Three Hundred Plus Stone of Grain to the State at Once
    -- The Effectiveness of the General Line Propaganda by the Liming Agricultural Production Cooperative
    Tao Guichun, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Propaganda Department of the Liaodong Provincial Party Committee
    The Liming Agricultural Production Cooperative in Woniushan Village, Fourth District, Dongfeng County, Liaodong Province, was formed this spring from three mutual aid teams, with a total of twenty-five households, one hundred and four people, fifty-four *qing* of land, and an additional ten *qing* rented in. This year, the cooperative harvested over five hundred *shi* of grain and over twenty thousand *jin* of potatoes. Recently, after the working group of the Provincial Party Committee's Propaganda Department held a forum in the cooperative to conduct general line propaganda, it increased the production enthusiasm of the members and promoted grain sales in the entire village. The members unanimously decided to sell more than three hundred *shi* of grain to the state in one go. Facts prove that conducting general line propaganda is the key to doing a good job in current rural production and grain purchase work.
    1. Determined to Strive for Socialism
    The cooperative members first discussed the happy life of Soviet farmers. Zhou Lizeng, the deputy director of the cooperative, guided everyone to discuss the fact that Soviet farmers lived well because they harvested a lot of grain, and why Soviet farmers harvested a lot of grain. Accountant Chang Zhaoyong said, "Because they use tractors to farm the land." Thus, a discussion unfolded on whether using tractors to farm could increase grain yields. Chang Zhaoyong cited the fact that the Wu Fengqi Collective Farm's tractors cultivated more than fifteen *qing* of land every day, and that the cooperative's use of shovel cultivators and ammonium sulfate fertilizer had doubled the yield compared to the Japanese puppet era. This convinced the general members that Soviet farmers using tractors and new farming methods could indeed save labor, increase grain yields, and live well. However, Li Baowen believed that the cooperative's mountainous land could not use tractors and there was no way to increase grain yields. The director then used the fact that Wu Fengqi visited the Soviet Union and personally saw that all-purpose machines could cultivate mountainous land and even shovel orchards, to convince everyone. At the same time, the fact that Hong Zhendou in the village bought grain pits to exploit others was used to guide everyone to recall the suffering from exploitation in the old society. From this discussion, all the cooperative members unanimously believed that they could no longer take the old road, but must take "Chairman Mao's road, the Communist Party's road," oppose exploiting people, and resolutely strive for socialism.
    2. Comparing the Bent Plow to Tractors, Establishing Industrialization Thinking
    Next, the discussion turned to how to strive for socialism. Many cooperative members said:
   "Organize and work hard, and you can harvest more grain." However, they did not link industry and agriculture. At this time, Party member Cao Peifu said, "Just organizing is still using bent plows, and the increase in production is limited. To harvest more grain, the worker elder brothers must make new farm tools and tractors." At this suggestion, everyone started another discussion. Wang Guoquan said, "Our ancestors have used bent plows and put in a lot of effort, but they haven't harvested much grain. In the movie (slides), the Soviets plant and harvest with machines, and they harvest more grain with less effort. The labor force is truly 'liberated'." Then, everyone said one sentence after another, "To strive for socialism, you must have new farm tools and tractors," "With new farm tools and tractors, you won't have to put in so much effort," "When will we be able to have many new farm tools and tractors!" Party member Cao Peifu said, "These things can't be grown in the fields, they have to come from factories." Some cooperative members said, "That's right, even sickles have to be made by workers!" Cao Peifu continued, "To strive for socialism and use tractors, you have to develop industry and open more factories." Everyone said, "That's right, old farmers can work hard to produce grain, but they can't produce new farm tools and tractors!" Later, they talked about the fact that due to the development of national industry in recent years, cloth is both good and cheap. Thus, everyone clearly realized that to strive for socialism, industry must be developed.
    3. Enthusiastically Selling Grain to Support Industrial Construction
    After the cooperative members realized the principle that to strive for socialism and manufacture new farm tools and tractors, more factories must be opened, Zhou Lizeng guided everyone to discuss what responsibilities farmers have for developing industry. From this discussion, the cooperative members quickly realized that the more factories there are, the more workers there will be, and the more grain they will eat. The responsibility of farmers is to supply grain. Wang Guoquan said, "To take the road of socialism, we must work hard, increase production, conserve grain, and sell all the grain to the state." Chang Zhaoyong said, "For a happier future, we are willing to suffer a little bit. Apart from public grain, livestock feed, seeds, and the grain each person eats, is it okay if we sell all the grain to the state?" Everyone said in unison, "Okay!" After calculation, the cooperative can harvest more than five hundred *shi* of grain. Apart from self-use, they decided to sell more than three hundred *shi* to the state. They also decided that the grain to be sold by the cooperative members would be sold together by the cooperative, and the money earned would be temporarily deposited in the credit cooperative if it was not used.
    4. Promoting the Entire Village, Influencing Wealthy Households Unwilling to Sell Grain
    Originally, the Zhao Mingyu mutual aid team in the village had concerns about selling grain to the state, and the members of the Yao Hai mutual aid team also complained. However, after they participated in the cooperative members' meeting, they went back and convened a meeting of the team members to discuss how good socialism is, how to strive for socialism... As a result, the Zhao Mingyu team decided to sell eighty *shi* of grain to the state (the entire team harvested one hundred and sixty-eight *shi*). The village cadres felt that the general line education had a great effect, so they convened a meeting of the Zhao and Yao teams, as well as the mutual aid team leaders and administrative team leaders of the entire village, to conduct the same education. With the influence of the expanded branch meeting, each mutual aid team and administrative team in the village successively convened meetings of key members and team meetings to discuss how to strive for the road of socialism and sell grain to the state. On the evening of the 16th, a village-wide meeting was held, and the deputy secretary of the village's Communist Party branch conveyed the spirit of the county's village cadre meeting. The village cadres and military families all expressed their attitude of selling grain to the state in order to strive for socialism at the meeting. At this time, the enthusiasm of the masses to strive for socialism was even higher. On the evening of the 17th, each administrative team also held a meeting to discuss and deliberate. At present, many mutual aid teams have initially studied and put forward plans to sell grain to the state.
    The consciousness of the masses has been raised, and the wealthy households who were unwilling to sell grain have also followed suit and sold grain. For example, the wealthy household Zhao Chengzhang originally did not want to sell grain, and only waited to sell it at a high price when grain was scarce. The masses were very dissatisfied with him. Many people said, "They (the wealthy households) also have a share in using tractors in socialism, why don't they sell grain to the state?" After education, Zhao Chengzhang also said to Wang Dianxiang, the deputy secretary of the branch, "I cultivate one *qing* and four *mu* of land and harvest fourteen *shi* of grain. Apart from self-use, I guarantee that I will sell the remaining seven *shi* of grain to the state. Everyone is watching, how can I not love the country and not listen to the Communist Party! I was also oppressed during the Japanese puppet regime!" Then, the old man Nian Huifeng also took the initiative to mobilize the wealthy households Ding Futian and others to sell grain.
    5. Seeing the Prospect, Enhancing the Enthusiasm for Production and Mutual Aid and Cooperation
    Before the Liming Agricultural Production Cooperative conducted the general line propaganda for all members this time, it first convened a meeting of key members for deliberation and preparation. When holding the forum for all members, it was personally led by the deputy director of the cooperative, so it was able to closely link with reality, fully mobilize everyone to discuss, and achieve relatively significant results. In addition, the cooperative members usually have a more detailed understanding of the happy life of Soviet farmers and the situation of the Wu Fengqi Collective Farm. "Learning from the Soviet Union," "taking the Soviet road," and "striving for socialism" have long become the driving force for promoting the positive production and work of cooperative members and cadres. When the cooperative conducts criticism and commendation, it is linked to the issue of "striving for socialism." Zhou Lizeng, the deputy director of the cooperative, said, "In order to strive for socialism, our cooperative has become more and more motivated from spring to now." After this general line propaganda, the farmers of the entire cooperative and the entire village more clearly saw the prospect, and their enthusiasm for production and mutual aid and cooperation has been further enhanced. In addition to selling surplus grain to the state, they are also actively carrying out winter production and planning to expand reproduction next year. Wang Guoquan said, "To get to socialism faster, we have to work harder, produce more, and sell more grain to the state." Zhang Zhaoxiang said, "We four people weave baskets, and one person can weave four or five a day. From now until before planting next spring, we can earn seven or eight million yuan. This money can be used to buy ammonium sulfate and expand production next year, and sell more grain to the state..." Sheep herders, livestock feeders, cart drivers, and women have all put forward plans for increasing production and saving. Everyone said to work hard and establish a collective farm as soon as possible. The Zhao Mingyu mutual aid team has also formulated a plan to carry out winter production and expand production next year to produce more grain and support the country's industrial construction.

    把三百多石粮食一次卖给国家
    ——黎明农业生产合作社进行总路线宣传的成效
    中共辽东省委宣传部宣传处副处长  陶贵春
    辽东省东丰县四区卧牛山村黎明农业生产合作社，是今年春天由三个互助组组成的，共二十五户，一百零四口人，有五十四垧地，另外还租入十垧。今年社里打粮五百余石，产土豆两万余斤。最近，省委宣传部工作组在社里召开座谈会，进行总路线宣传后，提高了社员的生产积极性，推动了全村卖粮。社员一致决定：把三百多石粮食一次卖给国家。事实证明，进行总路线宣传是作好当前农村生产和购粮工作的关键。
    一、决心奔社会主义
    社员们首先讨论了苏联农民的幸福生活。该社副主任周力增引导大家讨论了苏联农民生活好，是因为粮食打得多，及苏联农民为什么打粮多的问题。会计常照永说：“因为人家用拖拉机种地。”于是展开了拖拉机种地能否多打粮的讨论。常照永举出吴凤岐集体农庄的拖拉机每天种十五垧多地，和该社因使用铲趟机、硫安农药，比伪满时产量提高一倍的事实，使一般社员相信了苏联农民用拖拉机和新耕作法种地，确能省力气，打粮多，生活好。但李保文却认为该社的山地不能用拖拉机，没办法多打粮。主任又用吴凤岐到苏联参观，亲眼看见万能机能种山地，还能铲果园子的事实，说服了大家。同时又用本村洪振斗买粮窝子剥削别人的事实，引导大家回忆了旧社会受剥削的痛苦。由这一讨论，全体社员一致认为不能再走老路了，要走“毛主席的路，共产党的路”，反对剥削人，坚决奔社会主义。
    二、弯钩犁对比拖拉机，树立工业化思想
    接着讨论怎样奔社会主义。许多社员都说：
  “组织起来，下力干，就可多打粮食。”但是，没有把工业和农业联系起来。这时党员曹培福说：“光组织起来，还是使弯钩犁，提高生产有限，要更多打粮，非得工人老大哥给造出新农具、拖拉机不行。”这一提，大家又展开了讨论，王国全说：“咱们从老辈就使弯钩犁，出老力啦，还没多打粮，看电影（幻灯）上，苏联种地割地全是机器，打粮多，出力少，劳动力真是‘解放啦’。”接着就你一句我一句的说，“要奔社会主义非得有新农具、拖拉机不可”，“有了新农具、拖拉机就再不出这么大力了”，“咱们多会能有许多新农具、拖拉机啊！”党员曹培福说：“地里可种不出这些来，得工厂出。”有的社员说：“可不是，镰刀还得工人打呢！”曹培福接着说：“要奔社会主义使拖拉机，就得发展工业，多开工厂。”大家都说：“对啊，老农民下力能生产粮食，可不能出新农具、拖拉机！”以后，又谈起几年来由于国家工业发展，布匹又好又便宜的事实，于是大家明确认识了要奔社会主义，就得发展工业。
    三、踊跃卖粮支援工业建设
    当社员认识到要奔社会主义，制造新农具、拖拉机，就得多开工厂的道理以后，周力增就引导大家讨论农民对发展工业有什么责任。从这一讨论中，社员很快就认识到工厂多了工人就多，吃粮也就多，农民责任是供给粮食。王国全说：“要走社会主义的路，咱们就要好好干，增产节约粮食，把粮食都卖给国家。”常照永说：“为了今后更幸福，就是苦一点也甘愿，咱们除了公粮、牲口料、种子和每人的吃粮，把所有粮食都卖给国家好不好？”大家异口同声说：“好呀！”经过计算，全社能打粮五百多石，除自用外决定卖给国家三百多石。并决定把社员要卖的粮食由社一起卖，卖得的钱暂时不用就存到信贷社。
    四、推动全村，影响不愿卖粮的富裕户
    原先，该村赵明玉互助组对卖粮给国家有顾虑，姚海互助组组员也叫苦。但是，他们自参加了该社社员大会后，回去就召集组员开会，讨论社会主义怎样好，怎样奔社会主义……。结果，赵明玉组决定卖粮八十石给国家（全组打粮一百六十八石）。村干部感到总路线教育作用大，就又召集赵、姚二组组员和全村互助组长、行政组长开会，进行同样教育，加上支部扩大会的影响，全村各互助组、行政小组都先后召开了骨干分子会和小组会，讨论怎样奔社会主义的路和卖粮给国家。十六日晚召开了全村大会，村里的中共支部副书记传达了全县村干部大会的精神，村干部、军属都在会上表示了为奔社会主义要卖粮给国家的态度。这时，群众奔社会主义的劲头更高了，十七日晚各行政小组还开会讨论酝酿。目前很多互助组都初步研究并提出了卖粮给国家的计划。
    群众觉悟提高了，不愿卖粮的富裕户也跟着卖了粮食。如富裕户赵成章本来不想卖粮，专等粮缺时卖高价钱，群众都对他很不满。很多群众都说：“到社会主义使拖拉机他们（富裕户）也有一份，他们为什么不卖粮给国家？”赵成章经过教育，也向支部副书记王殿祥说：“我种一垧四亩地，打十四石粮，除自用外保证把余下的七石粮都卖给国家，大家看着，我怎能不爱国不听共产党的话！伪满时，我也受过压迫啊！”接着，年惠丰老头子也自动去动员富裕户丁福田等卖粮。
    五、看到了远景，提高了生产和互助合作的积极性
    黎明农业生产合作社这次对全体社员进行总路线宣传以前，就先召开了骨干分子会议，进行了酝酿准备；在开全体社员座谈会时，又由该社副主任亲自领导，所以能够密切联系实际，充分发动大家讨论，收效比较显著。此外，该社社员平日就对苏联农民的幸福生活和对吴凤岐集体农庄的情况有较详细的了解，“学习苏联”“走苏联道路”“奔社会主义”，早已成为推动社员、干部积极生产和工作的动力。社里进行批评、表扬时，都联系到“奔社会主义”的问题，社的副主任周力增说：“为了奔社会主义，我们社从春起到现在，社员们的劲头越来越大。”这次进行总路线宣传以后，全社和全村农民更清楚地看到了远景，生产和互助合作的积极性更提高了。他们除把余粮卖给国家外，还积极进行冬季生产，计划扩大明年再生产。王国全说：“要快点到社会主义，咱们还得加劲干，多生产，多打粮食卖给国家。”张照祥说：“我们四个人编筐，一个人一天能编四五个，从现在到明春种地前能挣七八百万元，这钱可以买硫安，扩大明年生产，打更多的粮食卖给国家……。”放羊的、喂牲口的、赶车的和妇女们都纷纷提出了增产节约计划。大家都说好好干，好早成立集体农庄。赵明玉互助组也订出了计划，要进行冬季生产和扩大来年生产，多打粮食，支援国家工业建设。
