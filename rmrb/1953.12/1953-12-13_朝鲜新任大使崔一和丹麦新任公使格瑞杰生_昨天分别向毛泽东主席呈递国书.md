    Ambassador Cui Yi's Eulogy:
    Respected Chairman:
    I am greatly honored to present to you the credentials of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, appointing me as the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the People's Republic of China.
    The armed forces of the Korean people – the Korean People's Army – working closely with the outstanding sons and daughters of the great Chinese people, the true internationalist fighters – the Chinese People's Volunteers – inflicted severe defeats on the US imperialist aggressors and achieved a brilliant victory in the Fatherland Liberation War, making a great contribution to the great cause of safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world.
    The Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement signed between the governments of Korea and China has further consolidated and developed the unbreakable fighting friendship and solidarity between the peoples of Korea and China. The Chinese government has also given, free of charge, all the materials and expenses that the Chinese people aided the Korean people with during the war, as well as the materials and technical assistance urgently needed for the recovery and construction of the post-war national economy, and allocated a huge sum of money – 80,000 billion RMB – as a free gift to the Korean people. Encouraged by this, the Korean people are dedicating all their strength to the recovery and construction of the national economy destroyed by the war and the peaceful reunification of the motherland. I feel infinitely honored to be able to represent the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in fraternal People's Republic of China at this time.
    The friendly relations between the Korean and Chinese peoples are historical. Our two fraternal countries are not only happily adjacent to each other in terms of national borders, but are also closely linked in political, economic, and cultural aspects. In particular, through the staunch struggle against the common enemy of our people – the Japanese militarist aggression – the peoples of Korea and China have forged an inseparable friendship like flesh and blood. This relationship has been further strengthened in the common struggle against US imperialist aggression and has become a powerful and reliable force to guarantee our victory.
    The Korean people, receiving the great assistance and support from the fraternal Chinese people standing together with the people of all countries in the world peace camp headed by the great Soviet Union, are confident that they will surely achieve brilliant victories in the cause of restoring and developing the post-war national economy and peacefully reunifying the motherland.
    The entire Korean people extend sincere gratitude and honor to their true helper and comrade-in-arms – the Chinese people and their heroic Chinese People's Volunteers; and with infinite joy, they are watching the brilliant achievements made by the fraternal Chinese people in the struggle for the first Five-Year Plan of the national economy to open up the path of the great Chinese socialist industrialization, and at the same time, they sincerely congratulate them on achieving even more brilliant achievements and victories in the future.
    Respected Chairman, I assure you that I will do everything in my power to safeguard and further strengthen and develop the fraternal friendship and internationalist solidarity between the Korean and Chinese peoples, which are forged with noble blood. In carrying out this important task, I believe that I will certainly be able to obtain all the necessary support and assistance from you, respected Chairman, and the government of the People's Republic of China.

    Chairman Mao's Reply:
    Respected Ambassador:
    I am very pleased to accept the credentials of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea that you have presented, and I sincerely thank you for your congratulations.
    For more than three years, the peoples of China and Korea have forged a profound friendship in the struggle against the US aggressors. The recent signing of the Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement between our two countries has further consolidated and developed the long-standing, unbreakable friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries. The ever-strengthening solidarity between us will undoubtedly continue to contribute to safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world.
    I am convinced that with the fraternal assistance of the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and with the sympathy and support of the peace-loving people of the world, the brave and diligent Korean people will certainly achieve new and brilliant successes in the cause of restoring and developing the national economy and striving for the peaceful reunification of the motherland.
    I warmly welcome you to assume the post of Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the People's Republic of China, and you will receive my full support and the support of the government of the People's Republic of China in your work to strengthen and develop the fraternal, friendly, and mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Korea.
    I sincerely wish you complete success in your work.

    我很荣幸地向您呈递朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会任命我为朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻中华人民共和国特命全权大使的国书。
    朝鲜人民的武装力量——朝鲜人民军，由于和伟大的中国人民的优秀儿女、真正的国际主义战士——中国人民志愿军紧密协同作战，使得美帝国主义侵略者遭到了严重的失败，并取得了祖国解放战争的光辉胜利，为维护远东及世界和平的伟大事业作了巨大的贡献。
    朝中两国政府之间所签订的经济及文化合作协定，使朝中两国人民之间的牢不可破的战斗友谊与团结更加巩固和发展。中国政府并无偿地赠送了战争期间中国人民援助朝鲜人民的一切物资和用费，以及为了进行在恢复与建设战后国民经济方面所迫切需要的物资与技术上的援助，又拨巨款——人民币八万亿元——无偿地赠送给朝鲜人民。为此所鼓舞的朝鲜人民，正在为恢复与建设被战争所破坏的国民经济及和平统一祖国而献出一切力量。我得以在这时候到兄弟般的中华人民共和国代表朝鲜民主主义人民共和国进行工作，感到无限荣幸。
    朝鲜人民和中国人民之间的友好关系是具有历史性的。我们两个兄弟国家，不仅国境是很幸福地毗连着，而且在政治、经济和文化等方面，也是密切地互相关联着。特别是通过反对我们人民的共同敌人——日本军国主义侵略的坚强斗争，朝中两国人民结成了血肉不可分的友谊关系。这种关系在反对美帝国主义侵略的共同斗争中更加加强起来，成了保证我们胜利的强有力的可靠力量。

    全体朝鲜人民向他们真正的援助者和战友——中国人民及其英雄的中国人民志愿军，致以热诚的感谢和荣誉；并以无限欢欣的心情，注视着兄弟般的中国人民在为开辟伟大中国的社会主义工业化的道路的第一个五年国民经济计划的斗争中所获得的辉煌成就，同时并衷心地祝贺在今后能获得更光辉的成就和胜利。
    主席同志，我向您保证：我将尽一切力量为维护和进一步加强与发展以高贵的鲜血所凝成的朝中两国人民之间的兄弟般的友谊和国际主义的团结而努力。在执行这一重大任务中，我相信一定能够得到尊敬的您和中华人民共和国政府的一切必要的支持和帮助。
    毛主席答词大使同志：
    我非常高兴地接受您呈递的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会的国书，并衷心感谢您的祝贺。
    三年多来，中朝两国人民在抗击美国侵略者的斗争中，结成了极深厚的友谊。最近我们两国间经济及文化合作协定的签订，更进一步地巩固和发展了两国之间久已存在的、牢不可破的友好互助关系。我们之间日益坚强的团结无疑地将对保障远东及世界和平事业继续作出贡献。
    我确信：在以苏联为首的和平民主阵营国家兄弟般的援助下，在世界爱好和平人民的同情和支持下，勇敢而勤劳的朝鲜人民一定能够在恢复与发展国民经济及争取和平统一祖国的事业中得到新的光辉的成就。
    我热烈地欢迎您出任朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻中华人民共和国的特命全权大使，在您为加强并发展中朝两国之间兄弟般的友好互助合作的工作中，您将得到我和中华人民共和国政府的全力支持。
