Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 8th. Today, the American side continued to give explanations to thirty South Korean POWs, and still no one applied for repatriation.

Inside the explanation tents, the POWs listening to the explanations fully expressed their disgust and hatred for the reactionary rule of the U.S. and Syngman Rhee. Among the South Korean POWs listening to the explanations today, the parents of two POWs were innocently killed by the Syngman Rhee group; the wife of one POW was killed by American planes; the parents of one POW wandered around begging for food, and his cousin was forced to become a prostitute; another POW was a university graduate, but he had been unemployed under the reactionary rule of the Syngman Rhee group, and was eventually forced to join the Syngman Rhee army. He was often beaten and scolded. When the POWs brought up the disasters they suffered under the reactionary rule of the U.S. and Syngman Rhee, the Syngman Rhee explanation personnel were embarrassed and speechless.

After a very young and neatly dressed South Korean POW entered the No. 3 explanation tent, the Syngman Rhee explanation personnel wearing U.S. military uniforms sized up the little POW with narrowed eyes, and hurriedly took out a large number of photos and printed materials from his bag and spread them on the table. Then, he held his face in his hands and asked the little POW, "How old are you this year?" The little POW replied, "Fifteen years old."

The explanation personnel deliberately said, "You are not a soldier, are you?" The little POW said, "Yes, I was grabbed by you and forced to be a soldier three years ago, carrying things." This sentence made the explanation personnel feel very embarrassed in front of the Neutral Nations personnel. He hesitated and said, "During the war, it was unavoidable to grab you to help the army. I came here this time to tell you not to be deceived by others and to return to your hometown. This is a proclamation from the Ministry of National Defense, can you read?" The explanation personnel asked the Indian soldier to hand the proclamation to the little POW. The little POW looked at the proclamation and said, "I didn't know how to read in the past, but I learned to read in the POW camp in the North."

The explanation personnel took off his gold watch from his wrist, held it up high, wound it up, and shook his head pretentiously, asking, "Do you have a hometown? Do you want to go home to see your parents? Although the people in the POW camp all love you very much, your parents love you even more. Only the love of parents is the most precious in the world." The little POW suddenly showed a painful expression, and he asked, "Please, do you know where my parents are?" The Syngman Rhee officer pretended to be very sympathetic and lowered his voice, saying, "I don't know. But I believe your parents must be missing their child." The little POW angrily told him, "I'll tell you. My parents were killed by American planes, my little brother starved to death, and my arm was also injured by American planes that time." He rolled up his sleeve, revealing a fist-sized scar on his left arm for everyone to see. This made the Syngman Rhee explanation personnel very embarrassed, and he pretended to be nonchalant and said, "This is unavoidable during wartime."

Seeing that even this little POW was very stubborn, the explanation personnel leaned his head on the back of his chair and muttered to himself in frustration, "Troublesome!" Then, he suddenly jumped up, turned on the switch of the American-made tape recorder, and asked the little POW boastfully, "Have you heard this before?" But, unfortunately, the tape recorder was broken. He fiddled with the switch and touched the button in a fluster, but he still couldn't find the problem. The Swiss member of the auxiliary organization also came over to assist him, but the tape recorder still made no sound. The explanation personnel turned around and sternly said to the little POW, "You have to think carefully, do you want to go back to the Republic of Korea?" The little POW immediately expressed that he did not want to return to South Korea under the rule of the U.S. and Syngman Rhee. The explanation personnel pretended to be indifferent and comforted himself by saying, "Well, if you don't go back, it won't be a loss to the Republic of Korea at all." The little POW resolutely walked out of the door for those who did not apply for repatriation.

In the No. 5 explanation tent, when the explanation personnel boasted about how "happy" South Korea was, the POW listening to the explanation said sadly, "Yes, I once had a happy life, but not in South Korea, but in the POW camp of the Korean-Chinese side. In South Korea, I have never had a full meal, and my parents had to beg for food..." When the POW wanted to continue to accuse the crimes of the reactionary rule of the U.S. and Syngman Rhee, the explanation personnel hurriedly announced the end of the explanation. In the No. 2 tent, the Syngman Rhee explanation personnel enticed a POW, saying, "You will definitely get the treatment guaranteed to you by the Minister of National Defense; if you go back after December 23rd, you will not get this treatment. The POWs who went back before did not get this treatment." The POW chuckled and said, "In this case, this is a guarantee specifically made for us three hundred people. But why don't other POWs get it? The Americans must have said that if you can explain one person back, they will give you a lot of money, right?" The explanation personnel immediately became exasperated and roared, "To be honest, you three hundred people are nothing!" He immediately announced the end of the explanation.

Today, in order to prevent the POWs from accusing the reactionary rule of the U.S. and Syngman Rhee and from raising questions that would put them in an awkward position, the Syngman Rhee explanation personnel came up with two methods to prevent the POWs from having the opportunity to speak and to evade answering the POWs' questions. One method was to turn on the tape recorder and play noisy music after the POW spoke and raised questions, and then never look at the POW again, and say to the Indian chairman, "My explanation is over." In the No. 1 explanation tent, the explanation personnel only explained to four POWs in the morning, because the tape recorder took up nearly two hours. The second method of the Syngman Rhee explanation personnel was to instruct the "translators" they provided to deliberately mistranslate their words when the POWs requested further explanation or asked to speak, so that the Indian chairman would not understand the POWs' requests. One POW quietly requested, "I have something to say," and the "translator" of the Syngman Rhee group deliberately translated it as "He wants to make a speech." These "translators" also deliberately glared at the POWs with fierce eyes, trying to prevent the POWs from daring to speak.

### 八日听解释的美方战俘没有人申请遣返

    八日听解释的美方战俘没有人申请遣返
    【新华社开城八日电】今天，美方继续向三十名南朝鲜战俘进行解释，仍然没有人申请遣返。
    在解释帐篷里，听取解释的战俘都充分流露出对美、李反动统治的憎恶和仇恨。今天听取解释的南朝鲜战俘中，有两个战俘的父母被李承晚集团无辜杀死；有一个战俘的妻子被美国飞机炸死；一个战俘的父母到处流浪讨饭，表妹被迫当了妓女；另一个战俘是大学毕业生，但是他在李承晚集团的反动统治下却一直失业，最后被迫参加了李伪军。他时常遭到打骂。当战俘提出身受的美、李反动统治的灾难时，李承晚解释人员都狼狈不堪、无话可说。
    一个年纪很小服装整洁的南朝鲜战俘走进第三号解释帐篷以后，穿着美军制服的李承晚解释人员眯着眼睛把这个小战俘估量了一下，就急忙从皮包中掏出大批照片、印刷品摊在桌子上。然后，他两手捧着脸问小战俘说：“今年几岁？”小战俘回答道：“十五岁。”
    解释人员故意说：“你不是军人吧？”小战俘说：“是的。我在三年前被你们抓去当兵，扛东西。”这句话使得解释人员在中立国人员的面前感到非常难堪。他支吾其词地说：“战争期间，把你抓来帮帮军队的忙，那也是难免的。我这次来是要你不要受别人的欺骗，回到家乡去。这是国防部的文告，你认识字吗？”解释人员要求印度兵把这张文告递给了小战俘。小战俘一边看文告一边说：“我过去不识字，在北边战俘营里，我认识字了。”
    解释人员一面从手腕上取下他的金手表举得高高地拧发条，一面装腔作势地摇幌着脑袋问：“你有家乡吗？愿意回家看你的父母吗？战俘营里的人虽然都很爱你，但是你的父母更爱你，世界上只有父母的爱是最宝贵的。”小战俘突然显出沉痛的神情，他问道：“请问，你知道我的父母在那里呢？”李承晚军官装出很同情的样子放低了声调说：“我不知道。但我相信你的父母一定在想念着自己的孩子的。”小战俘愤怒地告诉他说：“我来告诉你。我的父母被美国飞机炸死了，我的小弟弟饿死了，我的膀子也是那一次被美国飞机炸伤的。”他卷起袖子，露出左臂上一块拳头大的伤疤给大家看。这使得李承晚解释人员十分狼狈，他装出毫不在乎的样子说：“战争时期，这是难免的。”
    解释人员看到连这个小战俘也非常倔强，把头靠在椅背上丧气地自言自语说“伤脑筋！”接着，他忽然一跃而起，打开美制录音机的开关，夸耀地问小战俘道：“你听到过这个吗？”可是，真不巧，录音机坏了。他手忙脚乱地拨拨开关，摸摸电钮，还是找不出毛病来。附属机构的瑞士委员也走过来协助他，但是录音机还是一点声音也没有。解释人员就转过身来厉声地对小战俘说：“你要好好考虑，你愿不愿回大韩民国去？”小战俘立刻表示不愿回到美李统治下的南朝鲜去。解释人员装出无所谓的样子聊以自慰说：“算了，你不回去，对大韩民国毫无损失。”小战俘坚决地走出了不申请遣返的门。
    在第五号解释帐篷里，当解释人员吹嘘南朝鲜是如何“幸福”时，听解释的战俘沉痛地说：“是的，我曾经度过一段幸福的生活，但不是在南朝鲜，而是在朝中方面的战俘营里。在南朝鲜我从来没有吃过一顿饱饭，我的父母不得不去讨饭吃……”当这个战俘要继续指责美、李反动统治的罪恶时，解释人员就急急忙忙地宣布结束解释。在第二号帐篷里，李承晚解释人员引诱一个战俘说：“你一定可以得到国防部长所保证给你们的待遇；如果你在十二月二十三号以后回去的话，就不会得到这样的待遇了。这种待遇，以前回去的战俘是得不到的。”这个战俘讪笑他说：“这样看来，这是你们专门给我们三百多人作的保证。但别的战俘为什么得不到呢？一定是美国人说你们能解释回去一个人，就可以给你们很多的钱吧？”这个解释人员立刻恼羞成怒，咆哮起来：“老实讲，你们这三百多个人算不了什么！”他马上宣布结束解释。
    今天，李承晚解释人员为了害怕战俘指责美、李反动统治和提出问题而使他们陷入窘境，想出了两个办法来使得战俘没有讲话的机会和逃避回答战俘的问题。一个办法是在战俘说话和提出问题后，就打开录音机，放出嘈噪的音乐，然后再也不看战俘一眼，就向印度主席说：“我的解释完了”。在第一号解释帐篷里，解释人员一上午只对四个战俘进行了解释，因为将近有两个钟头的时间被录音机占去了。李承晚解释人员的第二个办法是在战俘要求继续解释或请求讲话时，指使他们提供的“翻译”故意翻错他们的话，使得印度主席不了解战俘的请求。有一个战俘安静地请求：“我有话要说”，李承晚集团的“翻译”就故意译为“他要发表演说”。这些“翻译”还故意用凶狠的眼光瞪着战俘，企图使得战俘不敢讲话。
