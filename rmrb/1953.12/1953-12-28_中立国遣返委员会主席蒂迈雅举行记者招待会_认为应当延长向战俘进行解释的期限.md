Xinhua News Agency, December 27th dispatch: According to the Indian News Service in New Delhi: Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC) Chairman Thimayya said at a press conference held at the Indian Army Custodial Camp on December 26th, it seems appropriate to extend the explanation period for prisoners of war (POWs), especially since there were long delays at the start of the explanation work.

Thimayya said: Even if the ninety-day period is extended, the important question is whether the explanation work can be carried out in the way the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Headquarters hoped, which is to isolate the POWs and break up the organizations within the camps.

A reporter asked if he believed that "since the NNRC failed to conduct explanations within the ninety-day period, the fate of the POWs should be decided according to a mechanical timetable." Thimayya replied that since the political conference that constitutes the main part of the armistice agreement has not yet been convened to discuss the POW issue, the timetable does not need to be rigidly adhered to.

Thimayya believes that it is inappropriate for the NNRC to change the status of the un-explained POWs based on such a timetable, "because certain provisions of the agreement have not been fully implemented."

Thimayya believes that since the main provisions of the agreement have not been fulfilled, the POW issue should be submitted to a higher-level political authority than the NNRC for resolution.

Xinhua News Agency, December 26th dispatch: According to "l'Humanité" reporter Pierre Courtade's December 26th report from Panmunjom: NNRC Chairman General Thimayya told the "l'Humanité" reporter this morning that he does not believe there should be a "mechanical timetable" for "releasing" Korean and Chinese POWs; and that the explanation period should be extended. The U.S. side has consistently adopted a stubborn attitude, insisting that all POWs must be "released" on January 22nd. It was also at their insistence that the explanation work was interrupted on December 23rd, although the explanation period agreed upon by both sides was ninety days, and the Korean and Chinese side had only conducted explanations for ten days.

Given that the NNRC failed to provide ninety days for explanation, and given that the political conference has not yet been held, when asked about the specific question of whether the fate of the POWs should be decided by a mechanical timetable, Thimayya replied: "My Prime Minister has already answered this question. The political conference is definitely an important part of the armistice agreement. Unless the political conference has been convened, the final part of the timetable does not need to be adhered to. This is the Prime Minister's opinion. I support this opinion."

General Thimayya pointed out that the explanation work was originally scheduled to begin on September 26th, but was delayed for nineteen days until October 15th, and the NNRC itself was responsible for this nineteen-day delay. He said: "The NNRC is definitely responsible for the postponement to October 15th. We were unable to make arrangements at that time. Of course, I agree that the entire period should be compensated."

Strictly adhering to a "mechanical timetable" in the case of 20,000 Korean and Chinese POWs not having had the opportunity to be explained to, is, in General Thimayya’s view, "unjust."

The reporter inquired as to how he believes the POW issue should be resolved in the absence of key provisions of the agreement—explanation work or a political conference—being implemented. Thimayya said he believes this is a political issue to be resolved by the governments. He said: "This is not an issue that requires the NNRC to resolve. I believe that whatever measures are taken should be taken at the government level and must be agreed upon by both parties." Regarding whether he believes that the U.S. demand to take over the POWs on January 23rd is in the spirit or letter of the armistice agreement, General Thimayya replied that he fully agrees with Prime Minister Nehru's opinion on this point. He said: "There should be no mechanical timetable. The entire spirit of the agreement should be considered in terms of resolving the issue."

As for the question of extending the explanation period, General Thimayya said: It must be recognized that the issue of isolating the agents is the key factor determining the success or failure of the explanations, and it must also be recognized that it will be difficult to do so. It must also be recognized that the United States has repeatedly assured the POWs that there will be no explanations after December 23rd and that they will be released on January 23rd. According to General Thimayya, the danger of mass escapes will have to be faced after January 22nd.

General Thimayya finally said: One of the main difficulties is that India was notified at short notice and took over the work without having the opportunity to study the issues. He acknowledged that the initial failure to break up the agent organizations was a decisive factor in subsequent difficulties. He said: "Many of my staff members now recognize this." He also said: "And all our problems are made more difficult because we are required to solve these problems within a certain period of time."

It is expected that the NNRC's summary report—which explains why the explanation work was interrupted and who is responsible—will be published here within a few days. The report was approved on December 24th by a majority of the five commissioners. The Swedish and Swiss commissioners submitted a minority report, which was discussed this morning and will be submitted to a special meeting of the NNRC for discussion on Sunday.

### 中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅举行记者招待会  认为应当延长向战俘进行解释的期限

    中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅举行记者招待会
    认为应当延长向战俘进行解释的期限
    【新华社二十七日讯】据印度新闻处新德里讯：中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅二十六日在印度部队看管营地举行的记者招待会上说，延长向战俘进行解释的期限看来将是适当的，特别是由于在开始解释工作时，一开头就拖延了很久。
    蒂迈雅说：即使为时九十天的期限得以顺延，重要的问题是解释工作能否按照朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军司令部所希望的那种办法来进行，这就是隔离战俘并打破营场内的组织。
    有记者问，他是否认为“由于中立国遣返委员会未能用九十天的时间来进行解释，战俘的命运即应按机械的时间表加以决定”。蒂迈雅回答说，因为构成停战协定主要部分的政治会议尚未召开和讨论战俘问题，时间表不需要一定固执不变。
    蒂迈雅认为，由中立国遣返委员会根据这样的时间表来改变未听解释的战俘的地位是不适当的，
  “因为协定中的某些条款未能完全履行”。
    蒂迈雅认为，由于协定中的主要条款都未能履行，战俘问题应提交比中立国遣返委员会更高一级的政治当局去解决。
    【新华社二十六日讯】据巴黎“人道报”记者贝却敌二十六日自板门店报道：中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军今日上午接见“人道报”记者时说，他认为不应有“释放”朝中战俘的“机械的时间表”；并说，解释期限应予延长。美方一直采取顽固的态度，主张所有战俘必须于一月二十二日予以“释放”。也是在他们的坚持下，解释工作于十二月二十三日中断，虽然双方同意的解释期限是九十天，而朝中方面只解释了十天。
    鉴于中立国遣返委员会未能提供九十天的时间以从事解释，鉴于政治会议尚未举行，因此战俘的命运是否应由机械的时间表来决定，对于这样一个具体的问题，蒂迈雅答道：“我的总理已经答复过这个问题。政治会议肯定地是停战协定的重要部分。除非政治会议已经召开，否则，时间表的最后一部分便不需加以遵守。这是总理的意见。我支持这个意见。”
    蒂迈雅将军指出，解释工作原定在九月二十六日开始，后来拖延了十九天到十月十五日才开始，这十九天的拖延，是由中立国遣返委员会本身负责的。他说：“对于延期到十月十五日一事，中立国遣返委员会肯定是要负责的。我们当时未能作好安排。当然我赞成整个期限应予补足。”
    在两万名朝中战俘没有机会听取解释的情况下严格遵守一种“机械的时间表”，在蒂迈雅将军看来，“是不公正的”。
    记者询以在协议的关键条款——解释工作或政治会议——都没有执行的情况下，他认为战俘问题应如何解决。蒂迈雅说，他认为这是一个要由政府来解决的政治问题。他说：“这不是一个要求中立国委员会来加以解决的问题。我认为，不论什么措施，都应由政府一级采取，并须得双方同意。”对于他是否认为美国想在一月二十三日接管战俘的要求符合停战协定的精神或文字的问题，蒂迈雅将军回答说：关于这一点，他完全同意尼赫鲁总理的意见。他说：“不应有任何机械的时间表。协定的整个精神应该从解决问题的方面来予以考虑。”
    至于延长解释时期的问题，蒂迈雅将军说：必须承认，隔离特务的问题是决定解释成败的关键因素，而如果这样做是会有困难的。也必须承认，美国曾一再向战俘保证：十二月二十三日以后就没有解释了，一月二十三日就要释放他们。据蒂迈雅将军说：一月二十二日以后将不得不正视集体越营的危险。
    蒂迈雅将军最后说：主要的困难之一是：印度得到通知的时间很短就把工作接过来了，没有机会研究研究问题。他承认最初未能打破特务组织，是以后困难的决定因素。他说：“我的工作人员中不少人现在认识了这一点。”他又说：“而我们的一切问题所以更为困难，是因为要求我们在一定的期限内解决这些问题。”
    预料，中立国遣返委员会总结工作的报告——内中说明了解释工作何以中断，由谁负责——将于几天之内在这里发表。该报告已于十二月二十四日经五个委员中的多数批准。瑞典和瑞士委员提出了一个少数派报告，今天上午已予讨论，将于星期日提交中立国遣返委员会特别会议讨论。
