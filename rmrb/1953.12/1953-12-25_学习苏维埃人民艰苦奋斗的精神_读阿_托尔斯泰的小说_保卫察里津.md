    Learning from the Soviet People's Spirit of Hard Struggle
    ——Reading A. Tolstoy's Novel "The Defense of Tsaritsyn"
    Feng Yidai
    Everyone knows that the Soviet people live a happy new life, but not everyone knows the difficulties the Soviet people experienced in building this new life. They struggled hard, shed blood and sweat, and never bowed their heads in the face of difficulties, bravely overcoming the most difficult years. A. Tolstoy's novel "The Defense of Tsaritsyn" is one of the great works that expresses this fighting will.
    Through the lives of Ivan Gora, a worker from the Putilov factory in Petrograd, and Alippi, a rural girl, A. Tolstoy wrote an epic of the period from the Brest-Litovsk peace talks in the winter of 1917 to the defense of Tsaritsyn in the autumn of 1918. The Soviet people's fiery struggle for peace, for food, and for the future of the socialist motherland is profoundly expressed here.
    After the victory of the October Revolution, the Bolsheviks faced a major problem: how to thoroughly consolidate Soviet power. Lenin clearly pointed out: "The question is only: how should we defend our socialist motherland..." (Page 25). Ivan Gora, as a representative of the working class in Petrograd, said: "We ourselves are willing to build socialism with our own hands... We should sacrifice ourselves and work hard for this... But we are willing to live to see socialism..." (Page 19).
    Ivan Gora, like workers across the country, had not yet escaped poverty when he took on the combat mission of defending the socialist motherland. When German cavalry arrived under the walls of Petrograd and all the sirens in Petrograd sounded according to Lenin's orders, the workers, women, and students of Petrograd were awakened, poured out of their bunks and beds to the Smolny Palace, received weapons and ammunition, and rushed to the train station. Many workers were picking up guns for the first time. "These first Red Army troops were not yet worthy of praise in terms of quantity and combat significance at the time. But these people—gritted their teeth, tensed every nerve, and strained every muscle." (Page 59). They understood that without doing so, they would not be able to defend their motherland. Ivan Gora bravely took on the role of reconnaissance team leader, heading to the front line on a snowy plain. Their will was stronger than the German cannons and machine guns, and they saved the dying motherland.
    Due to the armed intervention of imperialism and the rebellion of domestic counter-revolutionaries, the fertile Ukraine had become the "granary" of Germany and Austria, and the grain supply line from Siberia to Moscow and Petrograd was cut off. Various counter-revolutionaries infiltrated the Soviet food supply organizations, engaging in sabotage and creating chaos, with the grain ending up in the hands of speculators, and wealthy peasants hoarding large quantities of grain.
    The working class suffered from hunger, receiving only one-eighth of a pound of bread so thin it almost had to be held in the hands, and there were even days when no bread could be distributed at all. But they still actively responded to Lenin's call to "fight for food is to fight for socialism," going to the countryside to occupy rural positions. Lenin proposed to Ivan Gora and other worker representatives: "A great 'crusade' should be organized to oppose food speculators, wealthy peasants, parasites, troublemakers, and corrupt officials..." (Page 145). Ivan Gora and thousands upon thousands of other workers responded to Lenin's call and joined this great "crusade," going to the countryside to fight the wealthy peasants. They encountered stubborn resistance from counter-revolutionaries, and thousands upon thousands of workers and Bolsheviks shed their last drop of blood to defend the socialist motherland. Ivan Gora was also poisoned by wealthy peasants when he went to the countryside, but he was not deterred by the enemy's axe. In a letter to his lover, Alippi, he said: "When my injuries heal, I will have a strict negotiation with the wealthy peasants of Konstantin Village." Even someone as simple as Alippi said in her young voice, "Give me a gun," because they were not afraid of hardship in order to create a happy tomorrow.
    This indomitable fighting spirit was also manifested in the Red Army, composed of millions of workers and peasants. Voroshilov's troops defended the North Donets region under pressure from German and White forces. They fought the enemy with fewer troops, using bayonets and hand-to-hand combat to break through the enemy's encirclement and retreat to Tsaritsyn; at the same time, they also had to preserve the army, preserve sixty trains of military supplies, and preserve the thousands upon thousands of refugees who believed in the Bolsheviks. This was an arduous task, but for the Bolsheviks, difficulties did not exist. When they were about to reach Tsaritsyn, the enemy blew up the railway bridge leading to Tsaritsyn. The project, which would normally take half a year to repair, was completed in a few weeks despite a lack of workers, vehicles, and horses, "...Voroshilov said that materials are subject to the revolution, and this was not said in vain—this bridge is a creation of the revolution, this is a bridge to the future." (Page 420) It was this strong will that enabled them to win victory.
    In Tsaritsyn, we saw the working people once again respond to the call of Lenin, Stalin, and the Bolshevik Party. The workers of the Gruzoles Timber Factory resolved to go to the front line en masse; the workers of the Mechanical Factory resolved to go to the front line en masse; the workers of the Ordnance Factory resolved to work in three shifts day and night, stepping up the production of steel plates and the manufacture of armored trains. Exhilarated and silent women and children handed over small packages containing bread, cucumbers, onions, etc., to their husbands, sons, and brothers who had now become soldiers, and returned to the city to replace the men in production and defense. Many young women went to the front to work as nurses, soldiers, and propagandists. Here, we saw that Alippi, a young girl from the countryside, had become a female soldier. She was "wearing a camouflage military uniform, a leather belt tightly fastened around her waist, and a new military cap with the Red Army star on it." She eagerly demanded progress, asking others to teach her to read in two weeks, and taking her first lesson in front of a bonfire.
    The power of the people is invincible, and the White armies of Krasnov and Mamontov were defeated. Coal miners, steel workers, and peasants who had fought thousands of miles united around the Bolsheviks, forming a regular and strong Red Army, producing tried and tested military commanders such as Voroshilov, Barkhomin, and Budyonny, and also training thousands upon thousands of Red Army men and women fighters such as Ivan Gora and Alippi. A. Tolstoy said it well: "The Bolshevik Party resolutely turned the October Revolution to meet the hardships, it should draw strength and creativity from here. The hardship lies in overcoming famine and breaking through the encirclement of counter-revolution, and also in the more important task placed before the working class, which is to transform the entire store of culture, knowledge, and technology accumulated by capitalism into necessities for building a new life." (Page 310) "The revolution... demands superhuman effort from the proletariat, which bears full responsibility for the dictatorship." (Page 310)
    The era depicted in "The Defense of Tsaritsyn" has been left behind forever by the Soviet people, but their "superhuman efforts" continue, and will always continue. It is because of this "superhuman effort" that the Soviet people have established a model for the people of the world to create a bright and brilliant new socialist life. In our long revolutionary struggle in the past, this model encouraged us to move forward bravely; on today's road of construction, this model equally encourages us to move forward bravely. We must always learn from the Soviet people's example of hard struggle to build a new society and a new life!

    学习苏维埃人民艰苦奋斗的精神
    ——读阿·托尔斯泰的小说“保卫察里津”
    冯亦代
    人人都知道苏联人民过着幸福的新生活，但不是人人都知道苏联人民在建设这种新生活的过程中经历过怎样的困难。他们艰苦奋斗，流血流汗，没有在困难面前低过头，勇敢地渡过了最艰辛的年代。阿·托尔斯泰的小说“保卫察里津”，就是表现这种战斗意志的巨著之一。
    通过了彼得堡普吉洛夫工厂工人伊凡·戈拉和农村少女亚丽萍的生活，阿·托尔斯泰写下了从一九一七年冬天布列斯特和谈到一九一八年秋保卫察里津为止这一时期的史诗。苏维埃人民为和平、为粮食、为社会主义祖国的明天所进行的火热的斗争，在这里被深刻地表现出来了。
    十月革命胜利之后，布尔什维克党人面临着一个重大的问题，就是，怎样来彻底巩固苏维埃政权。列宁明确地指出：“问题只是在于：我们应该如何来保卫我们的社会主义祖国……”（第二十五页）。作为彼得堡工人阶级的代表人物伊凡·戈拉这样说：“我们自己愿意亲手建设社会主义的，……应当为着这个，牺牲自己，埋头苦干……可是我们愿意活着看见社会主义的……”（第十九页）。
    伊凡·戈拉，和全国工人一样，还没有从贫穷里伸开腿，又担负起保卫社会主义祖国的战斗任务了。当德国的骑兵到达彼得堡城下，全彼得堡的汽笛照着列宁的命令都响起来的时候，彼得堡的工人、妇女、学生都被惊醒了，从吊铺和床板上涌到斯莫尔尼宫，领取了枪械和子弹，奔向火车站去。好多工人都是第一次拿起枪来。“这第一批红军部队，在数量上和战斗意义上，当时都还不足称道的。可是这些人呢——却都咬着牙，紧张着每一根神经，绷紧着每一条筋肉。”（第五十九页）。他们明白：不这样做，就无法捍卫自己的祖国。伊凡·戈拉，勇敢地担当了侦察队队长，在风雪交加的平原上，开往前线去了。他们的意志比德国的大炮机关枪还厉害，他们拯救了垂危的祖国。
    由于帝国主义的武装干涉和国内反革命分子的叛乱，富饶的乌克兰已经成为德奥两国的“粮仓”，西伯利亚通往莫斯科和彼得堡的粮食补给线被切断了。在苏维埃的粮食供应机构中，钻进了各式各样的反革命分子，他们怠工，他们造成混乱，粮食都到了投机商人的手里，富农也囤积了大量粮食。
    工人阶级忍饥挨饿，每天只领八分之一磅的稀得简直要用手捧的面包，甚至还有完全不能发给面包的日子。但他们仍然积极地响应了列宁提出的“为粮食而斗争，就是为社会主义而斗争”的号召，到农村去，占领农村的阵地。列宁向伊凡·戈拉和其他的工人代表们提出：“应该组织一支伟大的‘十字军’，去反对粮食投机分子、富农、寄生虫、捣乱分子、贪官污吏……”（第一四五页）。伊凡·戈拉和其他成千成万的工人，响应了列宁的号召，参加了这支伟大的“十字军”，下乡去和富农斗争。他们遭遇到反革命分子的顽固抗拒，成千上万的工人和布尔什维克为保卫社会主义的祖国，流尽了最后一滴血。伊凡·戈拉也在下乡的时候遭到富农的毒手，可是他没有被敌人的斧子吓退。他在写给他爱人亚丽萍的信里说：“当我的伤好了的时候，我要同君斯坦丁村的富农们严格地谈判一次的。”即使是单纯如亚丽萍这样的人，也用年轻的声音说：“给我一枝枪吧，”为要创造幸福的明天，他们不怕艰苦。
    这种不屈的斗志也表现在由千万工人农民所组成的红军身上。伏罗希洛夫的部队，在德军和白军的压力下，捍卫着北顿河流域。他们以寡敌众，以刺刀和肉搏来打开敌人的包围圈，退到察里津去；同时，他们还要保全军队，保全六十列车的军火辎重，保全成千上万的相信布尔什维克的难民。这是一个艰巨的工作，但对于布尔什维克，困难是不存在的。他们快冲到察里津时，敌人炸毁了通向察里津的铁路桥梁。平时需要半年才能修复的工程，他们在缺乏工人、缺乏车辆马匹的情况下，几个星期中就完了工，“……伏罗希洛夫说材料是服从革命的，这句话不是白说的——这座桥是革命的创作，这是通到未来的一座桥梁。”（第四二○页）就是这种坚强的意志，使他们赢得了胜利。
    在察里津，我们看见了劳动人民再次地响应了列宁、斯大林和布尔什维克党的号召。格鲁左列斯木厂的工人们议决全体上前线；机械厂的工人议决全体上前线；军械厂的工人议决日夜三班工作，加紧生产钢板，加紧制造铁甲列车。振奋而沉默的妇女和孩子们，把包着面包、黄瓜、葱等等的小包，交给了现在已成为士兵的丈夫、儿子和弟兄，便回到城里，去替代男人们担任生产和保卫的工作。不少的青年女子到前线去当看护、战士，做宣传工作。在这里，我们看见：来自农村的少女亚丽萍，已经成为一个女战士了。她“穿着保护色的军衣，腰里紧紧的束着皮带，戴着新的军帽，帽上缀着红军的星章”。她急切地要求进步，她要求别人两个礼拜教会自己识字，而且就在野火跟前上起第一课来了。
    人民的力量是不可战胜的，克拉斯诺夫和马孟托夫的白军被击溃了。转战千里的煤矿工人、钢铁工人、农民团结在布尔什维克的四周，组成了正规的坚强的红军，产生了如伏罗希洛夫、巴尔霍明科、布琼尼这样的久经考验的军事指挥员，也锻炼了如伊凡·戈拉和亚丽萍那样的成千成万的红军男女战士。阿·托尔斯泰说得好：“布尔什维克党断然地把十月革命转过来，去迎接艰苦，它应当在这儿吸取力量和创造力。艰苦在于克服饥荒和突破反革命的包围圈，而且也在于摆在工人阶级面前的更重大的任务里，就是把资本主义积累下来的文化、知识和技术的全部贮藏，变成新生活建设的必需品。”（第三一○页）“革命……对那负着专政全部责任的无产阶级要求着超人的努力。”（第三一○页）
    “保卫察里津”所描写的时代，已经被苏维埃人民永远丢在后面了，但他们的“超人的努力”，依然在继续着，而且永远要继续下去。就是由于这种“超人的努力”，苏维埃人民为全世界人民建立了创造光辉灿烂的社会主义新生活的榜样。在我们过去的长期革命斗争中，这个榜样鼓舞了我们勇往前进；在今天的建设道路上，这个榜样同样鼓舞着我们勇往前进。我们要永远学习苏维埃人民艰苦奋斗，建设新社会、新生活的榜样！
