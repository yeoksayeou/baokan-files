    Shanxi Dingxiang Zhou Nengyu Agricultural Production Cooperative
    Helps Poor Members Overcome Production and Living Difficulties
    The agricultural production cooperative led by Zhou Nengyu, secretary of the Party branch in Guanzhuang Village, Second District, Dingxiang County, Shanxi Province, has helped poor households and widowed and lonely individuals within the cooperative to initially escape poverty, enabling everyone to embark on the road to common prosperity.
    The agricultural production cooperative led by Zhou Nengyu was established last year. When expanding the agricultural production cooperative this year, Zhou Nengyu wanted to organize some of the village's impoverished households into the agricultural production cooperative to help them overcome their difficulties. At that time, some middle peasants saw that the agricultural production cooperative could produce more grain and were willing to participate, but they were afraid of suffering losses and were unwilling to accept impoverished households into the cooperative. Zhou Nengyu patiently explained to everyone that the agricultural production cooperative mainly distributes profits according to labor; whoever works more receives more grain. Although the labor power of the members varies in strength, no one suffers losses. He also said that the agricultural production cooperative should help these impoverished households overcome their difficulties in order to enable everyone to live a prosperous life together. After his persuasion and education, the average middle-peasant households had no objections. Thus, the cooperative expanded into a cooperative of twenty households, including five households with daily production and living difficulties, such as the widowed and lonely Fu Ernv, Zhou Nenggong, Zheng Runtang, Zhou Longrun, and Dong Liansheng.
    After the agricultural production cooperative expanded, it was time to start labor and production. However, Zheng Runtang and Dong Liansheng were elderly men in their sixties and could not work in the fields like the young and strong. Fu Ernv was a sixty-seven-year-old widow and could not do heavy work at all. Zhou Nenggong was a person who had fallen into poverty and become a "petty thief" due to natural disasters and man-made calamities; no production team wanted him, fearing it would damage the team's reputation. The cooperative management committee assigned them appropriate work according to the characteristics of each member. For example, the elderly and literate member Zheng Runtang was appointed as an accountant, with a daily record of three work points for bookkeeping, and he was also assigned some light work. Dong Liansheng and the old lady Fu Ernv did some light work, such as planting beans, thinning seedlings, beating cotton, and picking cotton. Zhou Nenggong, whom no production team wanted, was assigned by the cooperative director Zhou Nengyu to the production team he personally led, in order to facilitate education and transformation. During the spring plowing and sowing, several impoverished households had no grain to eat, and Zhou Nenggong wanted to go outside the cooperative to sell his labor for food. At this time, Zhou Nengyu thought: If the impoverished households were allowed to go out and sell their labor for food, instead of working on the land in the cooperative, this would only solve the immediate difficulties. When autumn came, they would not receive enough grain, and they would still be in difficulty next year. Therefore, he mobilized the members to lend grain to each other and helped the households short of grain to borrow temporarily from relatives and friends. After his persuasion and mobilization, members Zhou Liugou and Zhou Deshan lent Zheng Runtang four dou of grain, and helped the old lady Fu Ernv borrow five dou of grain from her relatives. Zhou Nengyu also helped Zhou Nenggong borrow eight dou of grain from the supply and marketing cooperative, solving their food problem. Because their difficulties in production and life were well resolved, their enthusiasm for labor was very high.
    Over the past year, the Zhou Nengyu Agricultural Production Cooperative has unified land management and rational use of labor, and by processing on the land and overcoming various natural disasters, they increased production by 14% compared to last year's actual yield, while the whole village generally reduced production by about 23% due to flooding. The members not only experienced great changes in their lives, but their social status and political awareness also improved. The old lady Fu Ernv, who used to be threatened by hunger, received a total of four shi and five dou of grain after joining the cooperative this year, which was one shi and seven dou more than the grain she received from partnering with others last year. The income of the old men Dong Liansheng and Zheng Runtang, who were old and weak and hired livestock workers for farming every year, increased by more than 15% this year. Zhou Nenggong was also educated and transformed by the agricultural production cooperative into a hard-working farmer, and he received a total of thirty-four shi, eight dou, and two sheng of grain this year. From then on, the lives of the impoverished households in the Zhou Nengyu Agricultural Production Cooperative have all changed, and everyone has personally experienced the benefits of the agricultural production cooperative. The masses outside the cooperative said: The agricultural production cooperative led by Zhou Nengyu really makes everyone collectively prosperous!

    山西定襄周能玉农业生产合作社
    帮助贫困社员克服了生产和生活困难
    山西定襄县二区官庄村党分支部书记周能玉领导的农业生产合作社，帮助社内困难户及鳏寡孤独户初步摆脱贫困，使大家都走向了共同富裕的道路。
    周能玉领导的农业生产合作社是在去年成立的。今年扩大农业生产合作社时，周能玉就想把村里一些困难户组织到农业生产合作社里来，帮助他们克服困难。当时有些中农看到农业生产合作社能多打粮食，愿意参加；但又怕自己吃亏，不愿意吸收困难户入社。周能玉耐心地给大家解释说：农业生产合作社主要是按劳分红，谁劳动得多，谁就分粮多，社员劳力虽有强弱，可是谁也不吃亏。他并说：对这些困难户，农业生产合作社要帮助他们克服困难，才能使大家共同过富裕的生活。经过他的说服教育，一般中农户没意见了。于是这个合作社就扩大成了一个二十户的社，其中包括平日生产、生活有困难的鳏寡孤独傅二女、周能功、郑润堂、周隆润、董连升等五户。
    农业生产合作社扩大以后，要开始劳动生产了，但是郑润堂、董连升都是些六十多岁的老汉，不能和青壮年们一样下地劳动。傅二女是个六十七岁的寡妇，根本不能做重活。周能功又是个因天灾人祸，生活困难沦为“小偷”的人，谁的生产小组里也不愿要他，怕坏了小组的名誉。社务委员会就根据每个社员的特长，给他们适当分配工作，如让年老识字的社员郑润堂老汉当会计，规定每天给他记三分记账工，并让他做些轻活。董连升和傅二女老太太做些轻活，让他们点豆下种、间小苗、打切棉花、摘棉花。各生产小组都不愿意要的周能功，社长周能玉便把他编入自己亲自领导的生产小组里，以便于教育改造。春耕下种时，几户困难户没有粮食吃，周能功要到社外卖短工赚口粮去。这时周能玉就想：如让困难户出去卖短工赚口粮，不在社里的土地上劳动，这只能解决眼前困难，到了秋后分不下粮食，明年还是困难。所以他就一面动员社员互借，一面帮助缺口粮户向亲戚朋友暂借。经他说服动员后，社员周六苟、周德善借给郑润堂粮食四斗，并帮助傅二女老太太向她亲戚借回粮食五斗。周能玉又帮助周能功从供销合作社借了八斗粮食。解决了他们的口粮问题。由于他们在生产和生活中的困难问题都得到了很好的解决，因而他们的劳动积极性都很高。
    一年来，周能玉农业生产合作社，统一经营土地和合理使用劳力，并在土地上加工，战胜了各种自然灾害，因此在全村因涝灾普遍减产百分之二十三左右的情况下，他们社里却在去年实产量的基础上增产了百分之十四。社员不但在生活上起了很大的变化，同时社会地位和政治觉悟也随着提高了。曾经常遭饥饿威胁的傅二女老太太，今年入社后共收入粮食四石五斗，比她去年和人伙种地分到的粮食增加了一石七斗。因年老体弱而又每年雇畜工耕种的董连升、郑润堂老汉今年的收入都比往年增加了百分之十五多。周能功也被农业生产合作社教育改造成了勤劳生产的农民了，他今年共收入粮食三十四石八斗二升。从此，周能玉农业生产合作社中的困难户的生活都改变了，大家都亲身体验到了农业生产合作社的好处。社外群众说：周能玉领导的农业生产合作社真是让大家集体富裕哩！
