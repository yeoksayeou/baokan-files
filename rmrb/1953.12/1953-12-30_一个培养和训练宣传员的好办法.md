    A Good Way to Cultivate and Train Propagandists
    The Propaganda Department of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

    To strengthen the Party's propaganda work, the Propaganda Department of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has been running a propagandist's weekly lecture series since July 1952. Every Sunday morning, the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department uses a large lecture format to explain the current propaganda points and necessary professional knowledge to propagandists. As of August this year, the weekly lecture series has been held forty-one times. The facts over the past year have proven that in Anshan, a relatively concentrated industrial city, it is not only necessary but also possible for the Municipal Party Committee to hold regular lectures for propagandists.

    The content of the propagandist's weekly lectures mainly includes: (1) Explaining the current central tasks, such as the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, quality inspection, planned management, and the establishment and improvement of the responsibility system. When reporting on how to carry out the establishment and improvement of the responsibility system movement this year, the weekly lecture first elaborated on the significance of establishing and improving the responsibility system, pointed out the shortcomings of establishing the responsibility system last year, and how to improve this year, what systems to establish, what propagandists should focus on publicizing in the establishment of the responsibility system movement, and what to pay attention to. In this way, the propagandists have a relatively clear understanding of the central work to be carried out. (2) Explaining current events and policies, such as the major tasks of 1953 and the Korean armistice negotiations. (3) The basic principles and methods of propagandist work: such as explaining the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Establishing a Propaganda Network for the People in the Whole Party", how to do ideological work, how to run blackboards, how to write news reports, as well as introducing propaganda work experience and performing various forms of propaganda. Lecturers for the lectures are municipal-level reporters. When determining the content of each lecture, the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department selects reporters related to the content of the lecture as lecturers, and informs the lecturers in advance of the cultural level, political level, mass ideological situation, and requirements for the content of the report of the reporting object. The propaganda office designates someone to help the reporter prepare, and the lecture object includes propagandists from all over the city. However, the number of participants needs to be determined according to the size of the venue and the nature of the lecture content. For example, for current events and policy reports, propagandists from various units in the city can be notified to participate according to the specified number of representatives; for reports on basic construction and industrial and mining operations, propagandists from relevant units are designated to participate proportionally.

    The weekly lectures have yielded the following gains:

    First, the weekly lectures promptly pointed out the direction of work for the propagandists, increased the propagandists' propaganda capital, enabled the propagandists to cooperate with the central work of each period to carry out propaganda, improved the labor enthusiasm of the workers, and promoted production. Zhang Weicai and Gu Jiaze, propagandists of the fitter team of the Mechanization Supply Station of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Basic Construction, said after listening to the report on "How to Publicize the Establishment and Implementation of the Responsibility System": "We are vague about the central work of the second quarter. After listening to this report, we have a "bottom line" in our hearts, and it is really bright! We guarantee to publicize the purpose and significance of the establishment and implementation of the responsibility system movement based on the ideological situation of the workers, and do a good job in the movement." Wu Jichen (administrative team leader), a propagandist from the Processing Factory of the Pipeline Company, after listening to the report on "What Propagandists Should Do in Discussing This Year's National Plan," carried out propaganda against the conservative ideas of the workers in his team. At that time, the conservative ideas of the workers in this team were more serious. Last year, this team set the plan very low, so a day's work was often completed in half a day. During this revision of the individual plan, some workers advocated following the past backward quotas in order to over fulfill them in the future. Wu Jichen explained to everyone that if this continues, not only will everyone's technology not be improved and potential not be realized, but the speed of national industrialization will be slowed down. After the explanation, the workers' awareness was significantly improved, and the production plan was quickly revised, increasing labor productivity by one and a half times. Because the content of each lecture is combined with the current central tasks, the propagandists are very enthusiastic about listening to the lectures. Some people look forward to listening to the lectures several days in advance. When reporting on the Korean armistice negotiations, how to write news reports, or holding propaganda form performances, the venue is very crowded, and those who cannot get in listen outside (there are loudspeakers outside).

    Second, it promoted the branch to strengthen leadership over the propaganda network. Due to the frequent holding of lectures, some branch secretaries and propaganda committee members realized that carefully studying the content of the lectures based on the specific circumstances of their units would enrich the content of the branch's leadership of the propaganda network. For example, Zhang Jiangong, secretary of the C班 branch of the Ironmaking Plant, and the propaganda committee member, took the lead in participating in the lectures every time, and each time designated two propagandists with higher education levels to take notes. Then, the branch selected an appropriate time for the propagandists responsible for taking notes to convey the information to the propagandists who did not attend the lectures and the activists in propaganda work, and studied how to publicize to the masses. When discussing the national plan, the branch leaders and propagandists repeatedly carried out propaganda to eliminate various ideological concerns. As a result, under the promotion of party members, members of the Youth League, and propagandists, all the workers of the C班 of the Ironmaking Plant put forward 213 rationalization proposals and formulated a relatively advanced team plan.

    Third, it exchanged propaganda work experience and improved the professional level of the propagandists. After Comrade Li Changsheng, secretary of the Party branch of the Anshan Steel Casting Pipe Factory, introduced the experience of the branch in leading the propaganda network, many branches learned from their experience. The branches of the Ironmaking C班, the Primary Rolling Finishing, and other departments, after his introduction, combined with the actual situation of their units, rectified various systems of propaganda network work, and further led the propagandists to carry out ideological work. After listening to the experience of other units in organizing and consolidating reading groups, the propagandists of the Power Workshop of the Dagushan Mine immediately established the reading group in the workshop after returning to the factory. As for the performance of propaganda forms, everyone accepted it more quickly.

    Although the propagandist's weekly lectures have gained some experience over the past year, there are still many problems and shortcomings. For example, the content of the lectures is more mixed, the key points are not prominent, and the problems existing in the daily work of the propaganda network have not been concentrated for analysis and research, and solved through lectures. The work of preparing materials for reporters to introduce ideological situations and putting forward strict requirements for the content of reports has not been done well enough. Therefore, sometimes the content of the report is not systematic enough, or the combination of theory and practice is not good enough. Some units have not organized propagandists well to study and implement the content of the lectures, and the propagandists are done with listening to the lectures; at the same time, the inspection of the lecture effects is also very poor. The division of labor between the lectures held by the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department and the propagandist training classes and propagandist conferences held by the lower-level Party committees is not clear, which has led some lower-level Party committees to develop dependence and even not specifically arrange work. The main reason for these shortcomings is that the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department still underestimates the role of the lectures, the cadres' understanding is not unified enough, and they have not clearly realized that this is a main form for the Municipal Party Committee to regularly and directly cultivate and train propagandists.

    In order to make the content of the lectures universally conveyed to the propagandists, the object of the lectures will be changed to cadres above the propagandist team leader. After listening to the lectures, the team leader can convey the information at the propagandist team meeting and start discussions in conjunction with the work of the unit. In terms of the content of the report, the explanation of current events, policies, and some problems existing in propaganda work should be strengthened. Several lectures specifically for branch secretaries should be held to explain business knowledge such as how the branch leads the propaganda network. In terms of central tasks, the division of labor with lower-level Party committees should be clarified. Problems involving a wide range and major policies should still be explained through lectures. General problems are reported to the propagandists by the reporters of the lower-level Party committees. The preparatory work should be done well before the report, the contact with the reporters should be strengthened, ways should be sought to exchange reporting experience, and the reporters should be given necessary praise and appropriate remuneration.

    The Party committee and branch committee should formulate a system of regular inspections or spot checks to effectively check the effect of implementation after listening to the lectures and the problems encountered by the propagandists when publicizing to the masses, understand their requirements, and solicit their opinions on the lectures. Good propagandists should be commended at the conference and their experiences should be introduced. And the quality of the team leader's implementation of the lectures should be listed as one of the conditions for assessing the work of the propagandist team.

    一个培养和训练宣传员的好办法
    中共鞍山市委宣传部
    中共鞍山市委宣传部，为了加强党的宣传工作，从一九五二年七月起，开办了宣传员星期讲座。市委宣传部在每周星期日上午，用大报告会形式，向宣传员讲解当前宣传要点和必要的业务知识。截至今年八月为止，星期讲座已举办了四十一次。一年来的事实证明，在鞍山这样一个比较集中的工业城市里，由市委举办宣传员的定期讲座不仅是必要而且也是可能的。
    宣传员星期讲座的内容主要是：（一）讲解当前中心任务，如增产节约运动、质量检查、计划管理工作和建立与健全责任制等。在报告今年如何开展建立与健全责任制运动时，星期讲座就首先阐述建立与健全责任制的意义，指出去年建立责任制的缺点，以及今年如何改进，建立那些制度，宣传员在建立责任制运动中应着重宣传什么，注意什么等。这样，使宣传员对即将开展的中心工作有了比较明确的认识。（二）讲解时事政策，如一九五三年的几项重大任务，朝鲜停战谈判问题等。（三）宣传员工作的基本原则和方法：如讲解中共中央“关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定”，怎样做思想工作，怎样办黑板报，怎样写通讯报道，以及宣传工作经验介绍和各种宣传形式的表演等。讲座的讲师由市级报告员担任。市委宣传部在确定每次讲课的内容时，就选定与该次讲座内容有关的报告员为讲师，事先将报告对象的文化程度、政治水平、群众思想情况，对报告内容的要求等向讲师交代，并由宣传处指定专人帮助报告员做好准备工作，讲课对象包括全市宣传员。但每次需要根据会场大小和讲课内容性质的不同来确定参加人数。如时事政策报告，可通知全市各单位的宣传员按指定的代表数参加；关于基本建设、工矿业务性的报告，则指定有关单位的宣传员按比例参加。
    星期讲座已经获得了以下几点收获：
    一、星期讲座及时地给宣传员指出了工作方向，给宣传员增加了宣传本钱，使宣传员能够配合每一时期的中心工作进行宣传，提高了职工的劳动热情，推动了生产。鞍山钢铁公司基本建设机械化供应站钳工组宣传员张维财、谷家泽听完“怎样宣传建立与贯彻责任制”的报告后，说：“我们正对第二季度的中心工作模糊呢。听了这一报告，心里有了“底”，真亮堂！我们保证根据职工思想情况，宣传建立和贯彻责任制运动的目的和意义，把运动搞好。”管道公司加工厂宣传员吴吉臣（行政组长），听了“在讨论今年的国家计划中宣传员应做些什么”的报告后，就针对本组工人的保守思想进行宣传，当时，这个组的工人保守思想较严重。去年这个组就把计划订得很低，所以一天的活常常半天就干完了。在这次修订个人计划时，还有些工人主张按照过去的落后定额，将来好超额完成。吴吉臣就向大家说明：这样下去，不但大家的技术不能提高，潜力不能发挥，而且国家工业化的速度就会迟缓。经过解释后，职工觉悟有了显著的提高，迅速修订了生产计划，使劳动生产率提高了一倍半。因为每次讲座的内容都结合了当前的中心任务，所以，宣传员听讲的情绪十分高。有的听说要听讲，几天以前就在盼望着。报告朝鲜停战谈判、怎样写通讯报道，或者举行宣传形式表演时，会场十分拥挤，进不去的就在外边听（外边设有喇叭）。
    二、推动了支部加强对宣传网的领导。由于经常举办讲座，使一些支部书记和宣传委员认识到，根据本单位具体情况认真研究讲座内容，就会使支部领导宣传网工作的内容丰富起来。如炼铁厂丙班支部书记张建功和宣传委员，每次都带头参加听讲，并且每次指定二名文化程度较高的宣传员担任记录，而后，支部选择适当时间，由负责记录的宣传员向未听讲的宣传员和宣传工作中的积极分子进行传达，并研究如何向群众宣传。讨论国家计划时，支部领导宣传员反复进行宣传，扫除各种思想顾虑，结果，在党员、团员和宣传员的推动下，炼铁厂丙班全体职工提出了二百一十三件合理化建议，订出了比较先进的小组计划。
    三、交流了宣传工作经验，提高了宣传员的业务水平。鞍钢铸管厂党支部书记李长生同志介绍该支部领导宣传网的经验后，很多支部学习了他们的经验。炼铁丙班、初轧精整等部门的支部在他介绍后，结合本单位的实际情况，整顿了宣传网工作的各种制度，进一步地领导宣传员开展了思想工作。大孤山矿动力车间宣传员听完别的单位介绍怎样组织和巩固读报组的经验后，回厂后马上把该车间的读报组建立起来了。至于宣传形式的表演，大家接受得更快。
    一年来宣传员星期讲座虽然取得了一些经验，但也存在着不少问题和缺点。例如讲座内容较杂，重点不突出，没有把宣传网日常工作中存在的问题集中起来加以分析研究、通过讲座来解决。讲课前为报告员准备材料介绍思想情况，以及提出对报告内容的严格要求等工作都还做得不够。因此，有时报告的内容不够系统，或理论与实际结合得不够好。有些单位没有很好地组织宣传员研究贯彻讲座内容，宣传员听完讲座就算了事；同时，对讲座效果的检查工作也做得很差。市委宣传部举办的讲座和下级党委所举办的宣传员训练班，以及宣传员大会如何分工还不明确，以致使某些下级党委产生了依赖思想，甚至不专门布置工作。存在这些缺点的主要原因是市委宣传部对讲座的作用还估计不足，干部的认识上还不够统一，没有明确地认识到这是市委经常直接地培养和训练宣传员的一种主要形式。
    为使讲座内容能普遍传达给宣传员，今后讲座的对象决定改为宣传员小组长以上的干部。小组长听完后就可以在宣传员小组会上进行传达，并结合本单位的工作情况展开讨论。在报告内容上应加强对时事、政策和在宣传工作中存在的某些问题的讲解。并应专门举办几次支部书记参加的讲座，讲解支部怎样领导宣传网等业务知识。在中心任务方面，应和下级党委明确分工，凡是涉及面较广、政策性大的问题仍通过讲座讲解。一般性的问题则由下级党委的报告员向宣传员报告。在报告前应帮助报告员做好准备工作，加强和报告员的联系，设法交流报告经验，并对报告员进行必要的表扬，给以适当的报酬。
    党委、支委应订出定期检查或抽查的制度，切实检查听讲以后贯彻的效果以及宣传员向群众宣传时遇到的问题，了解他们的要求，征求他们对讲座的意见。好的宣传员应在大会上进行表扬，介绍他们的经验。并把小组长对讲座贯彻好坏列为鉴定宣传员小组工作的条件之一。
