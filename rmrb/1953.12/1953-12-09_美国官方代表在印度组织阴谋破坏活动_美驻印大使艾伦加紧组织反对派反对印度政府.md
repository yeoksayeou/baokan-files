Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, December 7th: The Pakistani newspaper "Today" published a report from Delhi, India, in late November, exposing the sabotage activities of US official representatives in India.

According to the newspaper, US Ambassador to India George Allen is currently intensifying efforts to establish a strong opposition faction against the Indian government, consisting of a united front of several of the most reactionary parties. To this end, George Allen himself and other officials of the US Embassy in India are discussing the policy program of future organizations with Chatterjee, Chairman of the Hindu Mahasabha, and the leaders of the Theosophical Society and the Bharatiya Jana Sangh in Delhi and other cities. Candidates from these parties, with US funding, have already defeated candidates from the Indian National Congress in several parliamentary by-elections.

The United States Information Service (USIS), as a branch of the US intelligence agency in India, has also recently intensified its anti-Indian activities. In addition to a headquarters in Delhi, the USIS has branches in Mumbai, Calcutta, Madras, and other major cities. The US State Department allocates more than 120 million rupees annually to this intelligence center to strengthen its activities, with the Calcutta branch of the USIS alone receiving 20 million rupees annually. The USIS informally controls several newspapers and magazines and uses them to influence public opinion and the government. Newspapers such as the "Indian Express" published in Mumbai, the "Southern News" in Delhi, the "Swatantra" in Madras, and the "Searchlight" in Patna regularly publish articles supplied by the USIS. In these articles, the Americans try their best to discredit all dissenting Indian social and political figures, including Prime Minister Nehru. The USIS spares no expense in establishing subversive organizations, giving them various names such as the "Young Men's Christian Movement" and the "Association to Defend Asian Freedom." Hundreds of "American experts," "travelers," and "missionaries" flood India every year. They can act freely in India, rudely interfere in all aspects of social life, and engage in provocative activities. For example, a group of American experts, ostensibly coming to "eradicate malaria," are actually mapping the distribution of military airfields and military bases in the Ambala area.

    美国官方代表在印度组织阴谋破坏活动
    美驻印大使艾伦加紧组织反对派反对印度政府
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社喀喇蚩讯：巴基斯坦的“今天报”在十一月下旬登载了来自印度德里的一篇报道，揭露美国官方代表在印度的破坏活动。
    据该报证实，美国驻印大使乔治·艾伦目前正在加紧在印度建立一个反对印度政府的有力的反对派，即由若干最反动的党派组成一个联合阵线。为此，乔治·艾伦本人和美国驻印大使馆其他官员正在德里和其他城市跟印度教大会主席查特吉及太平会、印度人民同盟的领袖，商谈未来的组织的政策纲领问题。这些党派的候选人在美国的资助下，已经在几次的议员补缺选举中击败了印度国大党的候选人。
    作为美国情报机关在印度的分局的美国新闻处最近也加紧了反对印度的活动。美国新闻处除掉在德里有一个总处之外，另在孟买、加尔各答、马德拉斯和其他大城市都设有分处。美国国务院每年要拨出一亿二千余万卢比给这个情报中心以加强活动，仅美国新闻处加尔各答分处每年就得到二千万卢比。美国新闻处非正式地控制了几家报纸和杂志，并利用它们来影响舆论和政府。如在孟买出版的“印度报”、德里的“南方报”、马德拉斯的“苏坦塔尔报”、巴特那的“探照灯报”等这样一些报纸，它们经常发表美国新闻处供给的文章。在这些文章内，美国人竭力诋毁一切异己的印度社会人士和政界人士，包括尼赫鲁总理在内。美国新闻处不惜花费美元来建立颠覆组织，给它们加上各种各样的名称，如什么“基督教青年运动”、“保卫亚洲自由协会”等等。每年都有数以百计的“美国专家”、“旅行家”、“传教士”布满印度。他们可以在印度自由行动，无礼地干涉社会生活的各个方面，进行挑衅活动。例如，有一批美国专家，他们名义上是来“扑灭疟疾”，而实际上是来绘制在翁巴拉地区的军用机场和军事基地分布图。
