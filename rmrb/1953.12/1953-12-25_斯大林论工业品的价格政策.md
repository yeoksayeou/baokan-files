    Stalin on the Price Policy of Industrial Products
    He Jun

    After the working class seized state power, and as the country entered the process of socialist industrialization, the establishment of an industrial product price policy was of utmost importance. As early as the initial period of the New Economic Policy in Russia, Stalin discussed this issue in his works, and later, he clarified this issue for us in his essays and speeches on numerous occasions. The Soviet state steadfastly implemented the industrial product price policy stipulated by Stalin, which brought immense material happiness to the Soviet working masses and promoted the rapid surge of industrial production.

    Stalin told us that the working-class state's price policy for industrial products is completely different from the policy adopted by capitalist countries in this regard. Stalin said: "The income from our industry is not used to enrich individuals, but to continue expanding industry, improving the material and cultural conditions of the working class, and reducing the prices of industrial products needed by both workers and peasants, that is, to further improve the material conditions of the working masses. Capitalists will not use their income to improve the well-being of the working class. They live for profit. Otherwise, they would not be capitalists." ("Conversation with the First American Workers' Delegation," "Lenin and Stalin on Socialist Economic Construction," Vol. 2, Liberation Press Edition). Elsewhere, Stalin said: "The policy adopted by bourgeois countries in this regard is completely different. In those countries, capitalists often organize enterprises into trusts and syndicates in order to raise the prices of domestic industrial products, turning them into monopoly prices, and using this means to extract more profit, creating a basis for exporting goods abroad" ("Conversation with Foreign Workers' Delegations," ibid.).

    In capitalist countries, capitalists generally want to sell their goods at higher prices in order to seize more profit. However, we sometimes see the phenomenon of falling commodity prices. However, that can only happen in the following two situations: One situation: In order to attack their opposing competitors, capitalists sometimes reduce the selling price of certain commodities below cost. However, this reduction is often followed by a more rapid rise in the price of the commodity. Because when opposing competitors have been driven out of the market, the capitalist is in a monopoly position in the market and does not need to continue to lower prices; now, for the capitalist, what needs to be done is to try to raise the price of the commodity as much as possible within the possible range, not only to compensate for the losses incurred in the past when prices were lowered, but also to try to obtain the maximum profit. Another situation: a general decline in commodity prices in the capitalist world. In the capitalist world, this general and sharp decline in commodity prices does not mean that the working people can obtain much material benefit from it; on the contrary, this decline in commodity prices is due to the extreme weakening of the purchasing power of the broad working people and the rapid shrinking of market capacity. Therefore, this decline in commodity prices generally becomes a signal of overproduction and economic crisis in the capitalist world. During economic crises, the working people are subjected to more brutal oppression and fall into a more miserable state of poverty and unemployment. This situation is even more acute, especially after capitalism has entered the stage of imperialism. At this time, the stronger the power of the bourgeoisie to maintain high commodity prices, the deeper the suffering of the working masses. Stalin pointed out: "The present capitalism is different from the previous capitalism. It is monopoly capitalism, which predetermines that, although there is overproduction, various capitalist alliances will inevitably struggle to maintain the high monopoly prices of commodities. Obviously, because of this situation, since the crisis has become particularly painful and more bankrupting for the main consumers of those commodities—the masses—it cannot but cause the prolongation of the crisis and hinder the dissipation of the crisis." ("Political Report and Conclusion of the Central Committee at the Sixteenth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)," Chinese People's University Edition)

    In capitalist society, although capitalists try to raise the selling prices of their commodities, from a relatively long historical period, it still shows a downward trend. Because, as everyone knows, price is the monetary expression of commodity value, and value is determined by the socially necessary labor time contained in each unit of commodity. The more socially necessary labor time contained in each unit of commodity, the higher the value of the commodity. With the development of social productive forces, the number of commodities that can be produced in a certain amount of labor time will increase accordingly, and the labor time contained in each unit of commodity will decrease, so its value will decrease. Marx summarized this law into the following formula: "The amount of a commodity's value is directly proportional to the amount of labor realized in it, and inversely proportional to the productivity of labor realized in it." ("Capital," Vol. 1, People's Publishing House Edition) It is this law of value of commodities that, against the will of the capitalists, stubbornly manifests its power through competition and economic crises, and forcibly forces commodity prices to tend to fall.

    Under the socialist system, as Stalin demonstrated in his brilliant work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," although the law of value has been strictly limited, it still exists and is consciously and deliberately utilized. Stalin's industrial product price policy is in line with this law and correctly reflects the trend of social productive forces development. This policy is the policy of continuously reducing the prices of industrial products. Stalin said: "The Soviet government believes that industry should serve the people, not the other way around. It believes that constantly reducing the prices of industrial products is the main way to develop industry." ("Conversation with Foreign Workers' Delegations") Stalin once called this policy "the pivot of our entire economic policy" (ibid.), the basic means of "improving our industry, expanding the market and strengthening the resources on which our industry must absolutely rely for development" ("Concluding Report on the Political Work of the Central Committee at the Fifteenth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)," People's Publishing House Edition) and pointed out that it is "the basic line that our industry must take" ("Speech at the Fifth All-Union Congress of the Soviet Leninist Communist Youth League," "Study Translations," 1953, No. 7).
                    ×　×　×
    According to Stalin's instructions, under the socialist system, the policy of continuously reducing the prices of industrial products is necessary for the following four reasons.

    First, this policy can promote the development of industrial production and make industry a strong industry. Therefore, this policy is primarily needed by industry itself. Stalin pointed out: "Industry based on high prices is not and cannot be a real industry, because such an industry will inevitably degenerate into a hothouse plant that has no vitality and cannot have vitality. Only an industry that constantly reduces commodity prices, only an industry that is based on constantly reducing product costs, only an industry that constantly improves its production, technology, organization of labor, management methods and methods, only such an industry is what we need, because only it can develop forward, and only it can enable the proletariat to achieve complete victory." ("Speech at the Fifth All-Union Congress of the Soviet Leninist Communist Youth League")

    Stalin pointed out that the method of raising industrial product prices "will definitely completely bureaucratize the state economic organs, because high ex-factory prices are the most effective means of making industry wither, turning industry into a hothouse plant, and bureaucratizing economic organs." ("On the Opposition Alliance within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)," "Study Translations," 1953, No. 10) Stalin also said: "This policy (referring to the policy of raising the selling prices of industrial products—author) first endangers industry itself, making it impossible for it to develop from its initial form into a strong industry, so we have a movement to reduce the prices of industrial products and increase labor productivity." ("Questions and Answers," "Selected Works of Stalin," Vol. 1, Northeast Xinhua Bookstore Edition)

    Second, this policy will ensure the continuous improvement of people's purchasing power and the continuous expansion of the capacity of the industrial product market, thereby ensuring that economic crises of overproduction such as those in capitalist societies will never occur under the socialist system. Not only that, but also, due to the continuous expansion of market capacity and the increasing demand for industrial products by society, industrial production will surge. Stalin said: "The reason why the mass consumption (purchasing power) of our Soviet Union is increasing, and always outstripping the increase in production, and driving production forward; while among their capitalists, the situation is exactly the opposite, the increase in mass consumption (purchasing power) always lags behind the expansion of production, always lags behind production, and often makes production fall into crisis, is precisely because of this." ("Political Report and Conclusion of the Central Committee at the Sixteenth Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)," Chinese People's University Edition) Stalin said: "Our industry is based on the domestic market, and we cannot and have no possibility of competing with capitalists in the foreign market. The domestic market is the basic market for our industry. From this, it can be seen that our industry can only develop and consolidate with the development and expansion of our domestic market (the capacity of this market, the demand of the masses for industrial products). And what determines the expansion of our domestic market and the increase in its capacity? This is determined by constantly reducing the prices of industrial products, that is, by the basic line of development of our industry that I mentioned earlier." ("Speech at the Fifth All-Union Congress of the Soviet Leninist Communist Youth League")

    Third, the realization of this policy will improve the living conditions of the broad working masses, and first of all, improve the living conditions of the working class and increase the actual wage income of the working class. Stalin said: "Without reducing the prices of industrial products, without constantly reducing the prices of industrial products, it is impossible to maintain the conditions necessary for continuing to increase workers' wages. First, the workers themselves are consumers of industrial products, so reducing the prices of these commodities cannot but be of great significance for maintaining and improving real wages. Second, reducing the prices of industrial products can stabilize the prices of agricultural products mainly consumed by workers in cities, which cannot but be of great significance for maintaining and improving workers' real wages. Can our socialist country not continue to increase workers' wages? No, it cannot. From this, it can be seen that constantly reducing the prices of industrial products is one of the most necessary prerequisites for gradually improving the living standards of the working class." (ibid.)

    Fourth, Stalin also particularly emphasized in many works the significance of implementing this policy for the worker-peasant alliance. Regarding the issue of the worker-peasant alliance, as everyone knows, Lenin and Stalin gave the greatest attention to it and made important contributions to the development of Marxism on this issue. Lenin called the principle of the worker-peasant alliance the supreme principle of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Stalin pointed out:

    "If the combination of industry does not have close ties with the rural economy that supplies raw materials, grain and various industrial necessities, if industry and the rural economy cannot become a unified whole of the national economy - then there is no socialism.

    "Therefore, the problem of the interrelationship between industry and the rural economy and the problem of the interrelationship between the proletariat and the peasants have become a fundamental problem in building a socialist economy." ("Questions and Answers") On this issue, Stalin severely rebuked the absurd argument of the Trotskyites who advocated raising the prices of industrial products and regarding the countryside as an object of exploitation and a colony of socialist industry. Stalin said:

  "Some people in our party regard the working peasant masses as alien, as an object of exploitation by industry, as a colony of our industry. Comrades, these people are dangerous people. The peasants are neither an object of exploitation nor a colony of the working class. The peasant economy is the market for industry; similarly, industry is the market for the peasant economy. But the peasants are not only a market for us. They are also the allies of the working class, and it is precisely because of this that improving the peasant economy, the large-scale collectivization of the peasants, and the improvement of their material conditions are a prerequisite without which we cannot guarantee any significant development of our industry. Conversely, the development of industry, the production of agricultural machinery and tractors, and the large supply of industrial products to the peasants are also a prerequisite without which agriculture cannot be promoted. This is one of the important foundations of the alliance between the working class and the peasants." ("On the Economic Situation in the Soviet Union and the Party's Policy." "Lenin and Stalin on Socialist Economic Construction," Vol. 2) Here, Stalin not only sharply criticized the mistakes of the Trotskyites, but also perfectly explained the economic content of the alliance between industry and agriculture. In order to firmly maintain this alliance, one of the important conditions is to correctly grasp the price policy of industrial products. Stalin repeatedly emphasized in his speech at the Fifth All-Union Congress of the Soviet Leninist Communist Youth League: "Without reducing the prices of industrial products, we cannot maintain the alliance between the proletariat and the peasants, between industry and agriculture, and this alliance constitutes the foundation of our proletarian dictatorship." and said: "If we want to maintain this alliance, maintain the alliance between the working class and the peasants and continue to develop agriculture, we must implement a policy of constantly reducing the prices of industrial products."

    Because, due to the implementation of the policy of reducing the prices of industrial products, on the one hand, the peasants will be able to obtain cheap daily necessities and means of production, which will make the living conditions and production conditions of the peasants improve day by day, thereby making "the basic peasant masses directly interested in the road of socialist industrialization" (Stalin). On the other hand, it has expanded the domestic market for socialist industry and established an indispensable prerequisite for the development of socialist industry. Because as Stalin said, "Only by relying on the gradual improvement of the material conditions of the majority of peasants (poor peasants, middle peasants) can national industrialization be implemented, because the peasants are the main market for our industry" ("On the Opposition Alliance within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)").

    When the New Economic Policy began to be implemented in Russia not long ago, the Trotskyites came out to oppose this price policy for industrial products stipulated by Stalin. Under the pretext of developing industry and raising the prices of industry, they created a crisis of difficulty in selling industrial products in the autumn of 1923. And "then it affected industry. Difficulties were felt in paying wages, which aroused the dissatisfaction of the workers. In some factories, the most backward workers had abandoned their jobs." ("A Short History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)," Chapter 9) Only when the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) took various necessary measures to reduce the prices of daily necessities, this crisis was overcome. Later, Stalin had more than once, in theory and practice, waged a struggle with the opposition conspirators to insist on implementing this correct industrial product price policy that truly conformed to the interests of the working class. According to this policy stipulated by Stalin, the Soviet government had repeatedly reduced the prices of industrial products. In the years after the Second World War alone, the Soviet government had reduced the prices of daily necessities six times, making the prices in 1952 on average half lower than at the end of 1947. The continuous reduction in the prices of daily necessities industrial products in the Soviet Union has become the most important source of growth in the actual wages and purchasing power of the broad working masses in the Soviet Union.
              ×　×　×
    Stalin, based on the relationship between workers and peasants under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and based on his profound analysis of the nature of socialist industry, concluded: "The basic line that our industry must take, the basic line that determines all future steps of our industry, is the line of constantly reducing the cost of industrial products, the line of constantly reducing the ex-factory prices of industrial products. This is the broad road that our industry must take if it wants to develop, if it wants to grow stronger, if it wants to lead agriculture, and if it wants to consolidate and expand the foundation of our socialist economy." ("Speech at the Fifth All-Union Congress of the Soviet Leninist Communist Youth League") Undoubtedly, Stalin's instruction has important guiding significance for all those who are working hard to build a socialist society. The realization of this policy will enable socialist industrial products to achieve vigorous development. And with the development of production, people's living standards will also improve day by day. But here we must also point out:

    First of all, the realization of the policy of constantly reducing the prices of industrial products is based on the continuous reduction of production costs. That is to say, to constantly reduce costs, we must constantly improve labor productivity and production technology, constantly improve the production equipment and management methods of enterprises, and make labor organization increasingly rational. Save on the consumption of raw materials and the management costs of production and commercial institutions. That is to say, only by constantly pushing social productive forces forward can the prices of products be reduced and people's lives be improved. Stalin taught us: "What must be done to make the policy of reducing the cost of industrial products and the ex-factory prices of commodities possible and fully realized? For this, it is necessary to fundamentally improve production technology, fundamentally improve the organization of labor in enterprises, fundamentally improve and simplify the entire economic organization, and wage a resolute struggle against bureaucracy in economic organizations." (ibid.) and said: "Thus, we arrive at a chain relationship: without systematically reducing the cost of industrial products and the ex-factory prices of industrial products, we cannot continue to develop industry; without adopting new technologies, new forms of labor organization and new simplified management methods, we cannot reduce the prices of industrial products." (ibid.) If you think that you can enjoy the benefits of reducing commodity prices without striving to improve labor productivity and reduce production costs, it is just a fantasy and has nothing to do with Stalin's industrial product price policy.

    Secondly, although constantly reducing production costs and improving labor productivity is the basis for reducing commodity prices, this does not mean that the speed of reducing commodity prices can be equal to or even exceed the speed of improving labor productivity or reducing production costs. If so, it is in effect making the growth of real wages equal to or even exceed the development of production, which is a violation of the Marxist principle of expanded reproduction. Because, as everyone knows, in order for industry to be carried out on an increasingly growing scale and on a constantly expanding basis, there must be an increasing accumulation. And if the speed of reducing commodity prices is equal to or even exceeds the speed of reducing production costs and improving labor productivity, it is obvious that accumulation is impossible. Stalin once pointed out: "Our industry has entered a stage of development in which it is impossible to greatly improve labor productivity and constantly reduce the cost of industrial products without adopting new and better technologies, without adopting new and improved forms of labor organization, and without streamlining our economic organizations. All this is necessary for us not only to improve labor productivity and reduce the prices of industrial products, but also to use the funds accumulated on this basis to continue to develop and expand our industry." (ibid.)

    The resolution of the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in August 1924 emphasized: "The increase in labor productivity should exceed the growth of wages." ("On Wage Policy," "Resolutions of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) on Economic Construction Issues," Vol. 1, People's Publishing House Edition) This precisely embodies Stalin's idea. Because without this, it is impossible to guarantee the accumulation of socialist industrial funds and expanded reproduction, and it is impossible to guarantee the cultural and national defense needs of the working-class state.

    Of course, the accumulation of production funds and expanded reproduction are not unique to socialist industry. Capitalist industry generally also has its own accumulation and maintains expanded reproduction. The difference between the two, apart from the different methods of accumulation, mainly lies in the fact that the expansion of socialist industrial production can be adapted to the level of people's purchasing power and the growth of market capacity, while capitalist industry can never have this adaptation. Because capitalists, although engaged in accumulating capital and expanding production due to the desire to pursue profit and due to competition among themselves, at the same time, they desperately exploit workers and the working masses and weaken their purchasing power, which cannot but make market capacity shrink day by day. It is precisely this contradiction that will eventually make bourgeois society completely collapse. And it is precisely in this aspect that socialist industry has demonstrated its superiority over capitalist industry, which has unlimited possibilities for development. Therefore, finally, we must also point out that although the accumulation required for expanding industry is indispensable, it must not be opposed to the price policy required for expanding market capacity. If you do not fully consider market capacity and disregard people's purchasing power; in order to increase accumulation, and excessively raise commodity prices, it cannot but be a tendency of blind advancement, and it cannot but adversely affect socialist industrial production. The resolution of the Thirteenth Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in January 1924 wrote: "The accumulation of socialist funds is the basic factor that determines the fate of the dictatorship of the proletariat during the New Economic Policy period. However, if, in addition to the cost and the necessary minimum profit, the expenses for rapidly restoring and expanding fixed assets, which the basic masses of our country are currently unable to bear, are added to the product price, from the viewpoint of socialist construction, this is wrong. In the future, it is necessary to coordinate the price policy with the most important peasant market to the greatest extent, and to coordinate the speed of industrial development with the overall process of expanding the capacity of the peasant market more closely than before."

    斯大林论工业品的价格政策
    何均
    在工人阶级掌握国家政权以后，在国家进入社会主义工业化过程的时候，工业品价格政策的确立，是有着极其重大意义的。斯大林早在俄国新经济政策的初期就在自己的著作中论述过这个问题，以后又多次在论文和演说中为我们阐明了这个问题。苏维埃国家坚持不渝地执行了斯大林所规定的工业品价格政策，便为苏维埃劳动群众带来了巨大的物质幸福，并促进了工业生产的迅速高涨。
    斯大林告诉我们，工人阶级国家对工业品的价格政策与资本主义国家在这方面所采取的政策是完全不相同的。斯大林说：“我们这里的工业收入不是用去使个人发财致富，而是用去继续扩大工业、改良工人阶级底物质的和文化的状况，用去减低工农所都需要的工业品底价格，即是说又是用去改善劳动群众底物质的状况。资本家不会把自己的收入用去提高工人阶级底幸福。他是为利润而生活的。不然他就不是资本家了。”（“与第一次美国工人代表团的谈话”，“列宁斯大林论社会主义经济建设”，下册，解放社版）在另一个地方，斯大林又说：“资产阶级的国家在这方面所采取的政策就完全不同。在那些国家中，资本家往往把企业组织在托拉斯和新迪加内，以便提高国内工业品的价格，使这种价格变为垄断的价格，用这种手段多榨取一点利润，造成商品输出于国外的基础”（“与外国工人代表团的谈话”，同前书）。
    在资本主义国家，资本家为了想多攫取一些利润，一般地说，总是想把自己的商品价钱卖得贵些的。但有时我们也会看到商品价格下跌的现象。不过，那只有在以下两种情况下才能发生：一种情况：资本家为了打击自己的敌对的竞争者，有时竟将某些商品的出售价格降低到成本以下。但这种降低之后不久，常常接着就会发生该种商品价格的更迅速的上涨。因为当敌对的竞争者已被逐出市场以后，这个资本家在市场上已处于垄断地位，便不必继续降低价格了；现在，对于资本家来说，所需要做的就是如何在可能范围以内尽力地提高该种商品的价格，不仅为弥补过去降低价格时的损失，而且要设法取得最大限度的利润。另一种情况：资本主义世界商品价格的普遍下跌。在资本主义世界，商品价格的这种普遍的急剧的下跌，并不是意味着劳动人民可以由此获得多少物质利益；相反的，商品价格的这种下跌，乃是由于广大劳动人民的购买力的被极度削弱，市场容量迅速缩小。因此，商品价格的这种下跌，一般地便成为资本主义世界生产过剩和经济危机的信号。在经济危机时期，劳动人民遭到更凶狠的压榨，陷于更为悲惨的贫困的和失业的境地。特别是在资本主义已进入帝国主义时期，这种情况就更加尖锐。这时，资产者维持商品高价的力量越强，劳动群众所受到的灾难也更深重。斯大林指出：“现在的资本主义与以前的资本主义不同，它是垄断资本主义，这就预决了，虽然生产过剩，而各种资本主义的联合仍必然为保持商品的高度垄断价格而斗争。很明显地，因为这种情形，既然使得危机对于那商品底主要消费者——民众变得特别痛苦与更加破产，就不能不引起危机的延长，不能不阻碍危机的消散。”（“在联共（布）第十六次代表大会上中央委员会的政治报告与结论”，中国人民大学版）
                  ×　×　×
    在资本主义社会里，尽管资本家力图抬高自己的商品出售价格，但从一个较为长久的历史时期来看，它还是表现着下跌的趋势。因为，如大家所知道的，价格是商品价值的货币表现，而价值则是由包含在每一单位商品中的社会必要劳动时间所决定的。包含在每一单位商品中的社会必要劳动时间越多，该种商品的价值也越高。随着社会生产力的发展，在一定劳动时间内所能生产的商品数量将随之增加，而包含在每一单位商品中的劳动时间就将减少，因而它的价值就将低落。马克思曾把这个规律概括为下列公式：“一个商品的价值量，与实现在其内的劳动的量成正比例，与实现在其内的劳动的生产力成反比例。”（“资本论”，第一卷，人民出版社版）正是这个商品的价值规律，它违背着资本家的意志，通过竞争，通过经济危机，顽强地表现自己的力量，并强制地迫使商品价格趋于下落。
    在社会主义制度下，如斯大林在自己的天才著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”中所论证了的，虽然价值规律已受到严格的限制，但它仍然是存在着的，并且它是有意识地自觉地被利用着。斯大林所规定的工业品的价格政策正与这个规律相适应，并正确地反映着社会生产力发展的趋势。这个政策就是不断降低工业品价格的政策。斯大林说：“苏维埃政府认为工业应为人民而服务，而不是相反。它认为不断的减低工业品的价格就是发展工业的主要方法。”（“与外国工人代表团的谈话”）斯大林曾把这个政策称为“我们整个经济政策的枢纽”（同前文），称为“改善我国工业，扩大市场并且加强我国工业绝对必须赖以发展的那种资源”的基本手段（“在联共（布）第十五次代表大会上关于中央委员会政治工作的总结报告”，人民出版社版）并且指出：它是“我们的工业所必须走的基本路线”（“在苏联列宁共产主义青年团第五次全苏代表会议上的演说”，“学习译丛”，一九五三年第七期）。
                    ×　×　×
    按照斯大林的指示，在社会主义制度下，不断降低工业品的价格政策之所以必要，有如下四个方面的原因。
    第一，这个政策能够促进工业生产的发展，使工业成为强有力的工业。因此，这个政策首先是为工业本身所需要的。斯大林指出：“以高昂价格为基础的工业，不是而且也不能是真正的工业，因为这样的工业必然会退化成没有而且也不能有生命力的暖室植物。只有不断减低商品价格的工业，只有以不断减低产品成本为基础的工业，只有不断改进自己的生产、技术、劳动组织、经营方式和方法的工业，只有这样的工业，才是我们所需要的，因为只有它才能向前发展，而且只有它才能使无产阶级获得完全的胜利。”（“在苏联列宁共产主义青年团第五次全苏代表会议上的演说”）
    斯大林指出：提高工业品价格的办法，“一定会使国家经济机关完全官僚主义化，因为高额出厂价格是使工业凋敝、使工业变成温室植物、使经济机关官僚主义化的最有效的手段。”（“关于联共（布）党内的反对派联盟”，“学习译丛”，一九五三年第十期）斯大林又说：“此种政策（指提高工业品的出售价格的政策——作者），首先危及工业本身，使它不能从雏形的发展中变为强有力的工业，所以我们有减低工业品价格与提高劳动生产力的运动。”（“问题与答复”，“斯大林选集”，第一卷，东北新华书店版）
    第二，这个政策将保证人民购买力的不断提高和工业品市场的容量的不断扩大，从而也就保证了在社会主义制度下，永不会发生如资本主义社会的那种生产过剩的经济危机。不仅这样，而且还由于市场容量的不断扩大，由于社会对工业品的需求的日益增长，工业生产就要高涨起来。斯大林说：“我们苏联群众消费（购买力）所以增加，所以总是赶过生产的增加，推动生产前进；而在他们资本家那里，情形恰恰相反，群众消费（购买力）的增加，总是赶不上生产的扩张，总是落在生产后面，往往使生产陷入危机的原因，就在于此。”（“在联共
  （布）第十六次代表大会上中央委员会的政治报告与结论”中国人民大学版）斯大林说：“我们的工业是以国内市场为基础的，我们不能而且也没有可能在国外市场上和资本家竞争。国内市场是我国工业的基本市场。由此可见，我们的工业只能随着我国国内市场（这一市场的容量，群众对工业品的需求）的发展和扩大而发展和巩固起来。而我们国内市场的扩大及其容量的增加又是由什么来决定的呢？这就是由不断减低工业品的价格来决定的，也就是由我在前面说过的我国工业发展的那条基本路线来决定的。”（“在苏联列宁共产主义青年团第五次全苏代表会议上的演说”）
    第三，这个政策的实现，将改善广大劳动群众的生活状况，而首先是改善工人阶级的生活状况，提高工人阶级的实际工资收入。斯大林说：“不减低工业品的价格，不使工业品不断的减价，要保持为继续提高工人工资所必需的条件是不可能的。第一，工人本身就是工业品的消费者，因此，减低这些商品的价格对于保持和提高实际工资不能没有重大的意义。第二，减低工业品的价格，就能稳定城市中主要是由工人消费的农产品的价格，这对于保持和提高工人的实际工资也不能没有极大的意义。我们的社会主义国家能否不去不断提高工人的工资呢？不，不能。由此可见，不断减低工业品的价格是逐步提高工人阶级生活水平最必需的先决条件之一。”（同前文）
    第四，斯大林还曾特别着重地在很多论著中为我们阐明实施这个政策对于工农联盟的意义。关于工农联盟问题，如大家所知道的，列宁和斯大林都曾给以最大的注意，并且在这个问题上对马克思主义的发展作了重要的贡献。列宁曾把工农联盟这个原则称为无产阶级专政的最高原则。斯大林指出：
    “如果工业的组合，与供给原料、粮食及种种工业需用品的农村经济不发生密切的联系，如果工业与农村经济不能成为一个统一的整个的国民经济——那就没有什么社会主义了。
    “因此工业与农村经济的相互关系问题及无产阶级与农民的相互关系问题，就成了一个建设社会主义经济之根本的问题。”（“问题与答复”）在这个问题上，斯大林曾严厉地申斥了那种主张提高工业品价格，把农村当作社会主义工业的剥削对象和殖民地的托洛茨基分子的荒谬论点。斯大林说：
  “我们党内有些人，他们把农民劳动群众看成异己的东西，看成工业底剥削对象，看成我国工业底殖民地之类的东西。同志们，这种人是些危险的人。农民对工人阶级既不是剥削底对象，也不是殖民地。农民经济是工业的市场；同样，工业是农民经济的市场。但是农民对我们不仅是市场而已。他还是工人阶级底同盟军，正因为如此，提高农民经济，农民底大量的合作化，其物质状况之改善，乃是一种前提，没有这种前提，就不能保证我们工业之稍微重大的发展。反转来说，工业底发展，农业机器及拖拉机底生产，工业生产品给农民的大量供给，也是一种前提，没有这个前提，就不能向前推进农业。这是工人阶级与农民联盟的重要基础之一。”（“论苏联经济形势与党底政策”。“列宁斯大林论社会主义经济建设”，下册）在这里，斯大林不仅尖锐地批判了托洛茨基分子的错误，而且完善地说明了工业与农业联合的经济内容。为了要巩固地保持这种联合，其重要的条件之一，就在于正确地掌握工业品的价格政策。斯大林在苏联列宁共产主义青年团第五次全苏代表会议上的演说里曾反复地强调指出：“不减低工业品的价格，我们就不能保持无产阶级和农民间、工业和农业间的联合，而这种联合是构成我国无产阶级专政的基础的。”并说：“我们要保持这种联合，保持工人阶级和农民的联盟并继续发展农业，我们就必须实行不断减低工业品价格的政策。”
    因为，由于降低工业品价格政策的实施，一方面农民就将能获得便宜的日用必需品和生产资料，这样就将使得农民生活条件和生产状况日益改善，从而也就将使得“基本的农民群众就对社会主义工业化道路发生直接的兴趣”（斯大林）。另一方面，它又为社会主义工业扩大了国内市场，为社会主义工业的发展，建立了不可或缺的前提。因为如斯大林所说，“只有依靠逐渐改善大多数农民（贫农、中农）的物质状况，才能实行国家工业化，因为农民是我国工业的主要市场”（“关于联共（布）党内的反对派联盟”）。
    当俄国新经济政策开始实行不久的时候，托洛茨基分子就曾起来反对斯大林所规定的这个关于工业品的价格政策。他们藉口发展工业，抬高工业的价格，制造了一九二三年秋天的工业品销售困难的危机。而且“接着便使工业受到影响。在工资发给上感到困难，因而引起工人底不满。在某些工厂中，最落后的工人曾经抛弃过工作。”（“联共（布）党史简要读本”，第九章）只有当俄共（布）党中央采取了种种必要的措施，把日用必需品价格降低，才克服了这个危机。以后斯大林又曾不止一次地，在理论上和实践上，为坚持贯彻这一真正符合于工人阶级利益的正确的工业品价格政策，与反对派阴谋分子进行斗争。按照斯大林所规定的这个政策，苏联政府曾一次又一次地降低了工业品的价格。仅在第二次世界大战以后的各年份中，苏联政府就曾六次降低日用品的价格，使得一九五二年的价格较一九四七年底平均降低一半。苏联日用必需工业品价格的不断降低，成为苏联广大劳动群众实际工资和购买力的增长的最重要的来源。

    斯大林根据无产阶级专政条件下工人与农民的关系，根据自己对社会主义工业性质的深刻的分析得出结论说：“我们的工业所必须走的基本路线，决定我们的工业今后一切步骤的基本路线，就是不断减低工业产品成本的路线，不断减低工业品的出厂价格的路线。这是我国工业所必须走的康庄大道，如果它想要得到发展，想要壮大起来，如果它想要领导农业，想要巩固并扩大我国社会主义经济的基础。”（“在苏联列宁共产主义青年团第五次全苏代表会议上的演说”）无疑地，斯大林的这个指示对于一切为建设社会主义社会而努力的人都有重要的指导作用。这个政策的实现，就将使社会主义工业产品能够获得蓬勃发展。而随着生产的发展，人民生活水平也将日益提高。但这里我们还必须指出：
    首先，不断降低工业品价格政策的实现，是建立在不断降低生产成本的基础之上的。这就是说，要不断降低成本，就必须不断地提高劳动生产率和生产技术，不断地改善企业的生产设备和经营管理方法，使劳动组织日益合理化。节约原材料的耗费以及生产和商业机构的管理费用。这也就是说，只有不断地把社会生产力推向前进，才能使生产品的价格降低，使人民生活得以改善。斯大林教导我们说：“要使减低工业产品成本和商品出厂价格的政策成为可能并完全实现须要做些什么呢？为此必须根本改善生产技术，根本改善企业中的劳动组织，根本改善并简化全部经济机构，并和经济机构中的官僚主义作坚决的斗争。”（同前文）并说：“于是就得出这样一个连环的关系：不去有步骤地减低工业产品的成本和工业品的出厂价格，我们就不能继续发展工业；不采用新的技术、新的劳动组织形式和新的简化的管理方法就不能减低工业品的价格。”（同前文）如果以为可以不去努力提高劳动生产率和降低生产成本，而能享受降低商品价格所带来的利益，则不过是一种空想，与斯大林所规定的工业品的价格政策是毫不相干的。
    其次，虽然不断降低生产成本和提高劳动生产率是降低商品价格的基础，但这决不是意味着降低商品价格的速度可以相等于或甚至超过于劳动生产率提高或生产成本降低的速度。如果这样，就是在实际上使实际工资的增长相等于或甚至超过于生产的发展，也就是违背了马克思主义的关于扩大再生产的原理。因为，如大家所知道的，要使工业在日益增长的规模上，在不断扩大的基础上进行，就必须有日益增多的积累。而降低商品价格的速度要是相等于或甚至超过了生产成本的降低和劳动生产率的提高的速度，很明显地，积累是不可能实现的。斯大林曾经指出：“我国工业已经进入这样的发展阶段，在这个阶段上不采用新的更优良的技术，不采用新的更完善的劳动组织，不精简我们的经济机构，就不能大大提高劳动生产率和不断减低工业产品的成本。这一切对我们之所以必要，不仅是为了提高劳动生产率和减低工业品的价格，而且也是为了把在这个基础上所积蓄的资金用去继续发展和扩大我国的工业。”（同前文）
    一九二四年八月俄共（布）中央委员会全会决议中曾强调指出：“劳动生产率的提高应超过工资的增长。”（“关于工资政策”，“联共（布）关于经济建设问题的决议”，第一辑，人民出版社版）这正是体现了斯大林的这个思想。因为不如此，就不能保证社会主义工业资金的积累和扩大再生产，就不能保证工人阶级国家在文化上和国防上的需要。
    当然，生产资金的积累和扩大再生产，并不是社会主义工业所特有的东西。资本主义工业一般地也是有着自己的积累和保持着扩大再生产的。二者之间的区别，除了积累的方法不同之外，主要地是在于：社会主义工业生产的扩张能够与人民购买力的水平和市场容量的增长相适应，而资本主义工业则永不可能有这种适应。因为资本家虽由于追逐利润的欲望，由于彼此间的竞争，而从事积蓄资本，扩大生产；但与此同时，他们又拚命剥削工人和劳动群众，削弱他们的购买力，这就不能不使得市场容量日益缩小。正是这个矛盾，使得资产者社会终将陷于完全崩溃。而社会主义工业也正是在这一方面表现了自己的、较资本主义工业有无限发展可能的优越性。因此，最后，我们又必须指出，为扩张工业所需的积累虽是不可少的，可是决不可使其与为扩大市场容量所需的价格政策对立起来。要是不充分考虑到市场容量，不顾及人民购买力；为了增加积累，而过度地提高商品价格，就不能不是一种盲目冒进的倾向，就不能不使社会主义工业生产蒙受不利的影响。一九二四年一月俄共（布）第十三次代表会议的决议上写道：“社会主义的资金积累，乃是新经济政策时期决定无产阶级专政之命运的基本因素。可是，如果除了成本和必要的最低利润之外，再将现时我国基本群众所无力承担的，用以迅速恢复和扩大固定资产之费用，加到产品价格中去，从社会主义建设底观点看来，这乃是错误的。今后，必须使物价政策与最主要的农民市场，作最大限度的协调，使工业发展速度与农民市场容量扩大之总进程作到较前更为严密的协调。”（“关于经济政策底当前任务”，同前书）
