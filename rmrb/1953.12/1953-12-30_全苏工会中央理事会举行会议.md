Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 29th: The All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions held a plenary meeting on the 26th and 28th in the Palace of Labor in Moscow.

    The Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, N.M. Shvernik, delivered a report at the meeting on the tasks of the Soviet trade unions in the great cause of developing the economy and increasing the material welfare of the people, in implementing the resolutions of the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the resolutions of the Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on expanding the production of consumer goods and improving their quality.

    Shvernik emphasized the great significance of these plans formulated by the Communist Party and the government to further develop the socialist economy and increase the material welfare of the working people. Then he talked about the role of the Soviet trade unions in completing these plans.

    Shvernik said: The Soviet working people support the resolution of the September Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee. Advanced machine tractor stations and state farms have already achieved victories in the struggle for the rapid development of various sectors of agriculture. The competition launched in agriculture has brought forth new innovators in various sectors of agriculture and discovered new methods of organizing production and increasing labor productivity.

    Shvernik said: To realize the plan for rapidly increasing the production of consumer goods requires trade unions to launch socialist competition in industrial enterprises, transportation, and construction sites, to mobilize the creative power of employees, and to improve the role of production meetings in various ways. Trade unions must strive to more fully explore production potential, to further develop socialist competition, to more fully utilize equipment, and to ensure that all workers complete their production quotas.

    In his report, Shvernik also talked about the tasks of trade union organizations in trade institutions, public canteens, and cooperatives in implementing the various resolutions of the Party and the government.

    The plenary meeting discussed Shvernik's report and adopted a detailed resolution.

    The Secretary of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, N.V. Popova, delivered a report at the meeting on preparations for the convocation of the Eleventh All-Union Congress of Trade Unions.

    The plenary meeting decided to convene the Eleventh All-Union Congress of Trade Unions in Moscow on May 25th next year, and adopted the following agenda: 1. Report of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions; 2. Report of the Supervisory Committee; 3. Revision of the Charter of the All-Union Trade Unions; 4. Election of members of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions and members of the Supervisory Committee of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions.

    The plenary meeting also elected a committee of thirty-nine people to study the revision of the Charter of the All-Union Trade Unions.

    Before the convening of the Eleventh Congress, all trade union organizations will report on their work and elect new leading bodies.

    The plenary meeting called on all trade union organizations and all trade union members to prepare for the Eleventh Congress, to launch a new upsurge of socialist competition among millions of employees, and to greet the Congress with new and great achievements in communist construction.

    全苏工会中央理事会举行会议

    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：全苏工会中央理事会二十六日和二十八日在莫斯科工会大厦举行全体会议。
    全苏工会中央理事会主席尼·米·什维尔尼克在会上作了报告，论述苏联工会在实现苏联最高苏维埃第五次会议、苏联共产党中央委员会九月全体会议的决议、以及苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会关于扩大日用品生产并改进其质量的决议中的任务。
    什维尔尼克着重指出了苏联共产党和政府为进一步发展社会主义经济和增进劳动人民的物质福利而制订的这些计划的重大意义。接着他又谈到了苏联工会在完成这些计划中的作用。
    什维尔尼克说：苏联劳动人民拥护党中央九月全体会议的决议。先进的机器拖拉机站和国营农场，已经在为迅速发展农业各部门而奋斗的过程中取得了胜利。农业中展开的竞赛使农业各部门中涌现了新的革新者，发现了组织生产和提高劳动生产率的新方法。
    什维尔尼克说：要实现迅速增加日用品生产量的计划，就要求工会在各工业企业、运输业和建筑工地上展开社会主义竞赛，要求工会动员职工的创造力量，并用各种方法提高生产会议的作用。工会必须为争取更充分地发掘生产潜力，为进一步开展社会主义竞赛，为更充分地利用设备，为使全体工人都完成生产定额而努力。
    什维尔尼克在报告中还谈到贸易机构、公共食堂和合作社的工会组织在实现党和政府的各项决议中的任务。
    全体会议讨论了什维尔尼克的报告，并通过了一项详细的决议。
    全苏工会中央理事会书记尼·瓦·波波娃就准备召开第十一届全苏工会代表大会一事在会上作了报告。
    全体会议决定于明年五月二十五日在莫斯科召开第十一届全苏工会代表大会，并通过下列议程：一、全苏工会中央理事会的报告；二、监察委员会的报告；三、修改全苏工会章程；四、选举全苏工会中央理事会理事和全苏工会中央理事会监察委员会委员。
    全体会议并选出了一个由三十九人组成的委员会，来研究修改全苏工会章程的问题。
    在第十一届代表大会召开以前，一切工会组织都将报告它们的工作，并选举新的领导机构。
    全体会议号召各工会组织和全体工会会员作好第十一届代表大会的准备工作，在千百万职工中掀起社会主义竞赛的新高潮，以共产主义建设中的新的巨大的成就来迎接代表大会。
