Xinhua News Agency, December 5th—Under the manipulation of the United States, the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly on December 3rd illegally passed an absurd proposal smearing the Korean and Chinese side for committing "atrocities" against "UN forces" and Korean civilians.

In order to cover up its heinous crimes of slaughtering prisoners of war and civilians in Korea, forcibly detaining prisoners of war, inciting war hysteria at home and abroad, obstructing the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and maintaining international tensions, the United States submitted a fabricated report to the United Nations General Assembly on October 29th, smearing the Korean and Chinese side for committing so-called "atrocities" against "UN forces" prisoners of war. Because the purpose of this report was so vile and shameless, and its content so absurd and ridiculous, the American Newsweek magazine on November 9th had to admit that world opinion dismissed it. But the United States was still unwilling to give up, exerting pressure to gather four followers, Britain, France, Australia, and Turkey, to submit an even more shameless report to the United Nations General Assembly on November 30th, smearing the Korean and Chinese side for committing "atrocities" against prisoners of war and civilians, and a provocative proposal demanding "condemnation" of the Korean and Chinese side. It also forced other countries to pass this counter-smearing proposal against the Korean and Chinese side, claiming to express "serious concern" about the so-called "atrocities" of the Korean and Chinese side fabricated by the United States.

The Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly passed this smearing proposal against the Korean and Chinese side without the participation of representatives from the Korean and Chinese side, which is not only completely illegal, but also extremely absurd and shameful. The fabrication and absurdity of the "atrocities" of the Korean and Chinese side fabricated by the United States is already a well-known fact. Even some American newspapers have repeatedly pointed out that this report "is a haphazard fabrication," these so-called "atrocity" intelligence were "obtained through abuse or torture," "the real atrocity is the report itself... this report is for no other purpose than to incite public opinion." Moreover, it is well known that it is the United States itself that slaughtered prisoners of war and civilians in Korea and clamored to "wipe Korea off the map," not the Korean and Chinese side. The absurd proposal put forward by the United States shamelessly talks about the Geneva Convention, but the United States has so far refused to ratify this convention. Therefore, it is the United States that should be condemned by the United Nations General Assembly, not only for refusing to ratify but also for wantonly destroying the Geneva Convention. However, the United Nations General Assembly acted perversely, ignoring and turning a deaf ear to the many investigation reports and protest letters submitted to the United Nations by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and many international organizations, while being obedient and submissive to the malicious and fabricated smear reports of the United States. This action of the United Nations General Assembly has added a new chapter to the shameful record of the United Nations.

The circumstances before and after the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly passed this smearing proposal prove that the United States' attempt to use this trick to counter-smear the Korean and Chinese side and cover up its heinous crimes in Korea is unpopular. After the United States first published a report smearing the Korean and Chinese side for committing so-called "atrocities," many countries expressed indifference and opposition. Under such circumstances, the United States did its best to fabricate even more shameful so-called "atrocity" reports, and instructed its propaganda machine to advertise it, shamelessly boasting about "amazing" documents; on the other hand, it exerted pressure on other countries to drag them into the water. But things still did not go as planned. The United States originally clamored fiercely to force the United Nations General Assembly to take "the toughest possible action" against the Korean and Chinese side, but later had to quietly change to asking the United Nations General Assembly to express "serious concern." Even so, the proposal put forward by the United States was still met with indifference and dissatisfaction from many countries. When the United States forced the United Nations General Assembly to debate its smear proposal against the Korean and Chinese side, in addition to being sternly rebuked by representatives of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, representatives of many other countries also expressed disinterest, either not attending the meeting or not speaking even if they attended. When voting on this proposal, ten countries abstained, and India indicated that it would not participate in the vote. At the same time, after the United States put forward this proposal, the United States Information Service hurriedly telegraphed its branches around the world, asking them to "extract some useful and better editorials and any official reactions as soon as possible," attempting to support the absurd proposal of the United States. But the result was like a stone sinking into the sea.

It is very obvious that the United States' holding the United Nations General Assembly to pass a proposal smearing the Korean and Chinese side can not only not conceal the ironclad bloody crimes committed by the United States in Korea, but also once again tarnishes the United Nations, making people increasingly see that the United Nations has degenerated into a docile tool for the United States to carry out the Cold War and create international tensions.

### 美国诬蔑朝中部队施行“暴行”的荒谬提案绝不能掩盖美国屠杀战俘和平民的罪行

    美国诬蔑朝中部队施行“暴行”的荒谬提案绝不能掩盖美国屠杀战俘和平民的罪行
    【新华社五日讯】第八届联合国大会在美国操纵之下，在十二月三日竟非法地通过了诬蔑朝中方面对“联合国军”和朝鲜平民施行“暴行”的荒谬提案。
    美国为了掩饰自己在朝鲜屠杀战俘和平民、用暴力强迫扣留战俘的滔天罪行，并且在美国国内和国际间煽动战争歇斯底里，阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题和保持国际紧张局势，曾在十月二十九日向联合国大会提出了一份捏造的诬蔑朝中方面对“联合国军”战俘施行所谓“暴行”的报告。由于这个报告的目的是如此卑鄙无耻，其内容是如此荒诞无稽，以致十一月九日的美国新闻周刊不得不承认世界舆论对之不屑一顾。但是美国仍然不肯罢休，使尽压力纠集英国、法国、澳大利亚、土耳其等四个跟随者在十一月三十日向联合国大会提出了一份更加无耻的诬蔑朝中方面对战俘和平民施行“暴行”的报告，和一项要求“谴责”朝中方面的挑衅性提案，并压迫其他国家通过了这项反诬朝中方面的提案，声称对美国捏造的朝中方面的所谓“暴行”表示“严重关怀”。
    第八届联合国大会在没有朝中方面代表参加下竟通过这个诬蔑朝中方面的提案，不仅是完全非法的，而且是极端荒谬和可耻的。美国提出的这份诬蔑朝中方面“暴行”的凭空捏造和荒诞无稽，已是众所周知的事实。甚至美国的一些报刊都一再指出，这份报告“是一种胡乱捏造”，这些所谓“暴行”情报是“靠了虐待或拷打而获得的”，“真正的暴行是这个报告本身……这个报告不是为了别的什么目的，只是为了煽动舆论。”而且，尽人皆知，在朝鲜屠杀战俘和平民，叫嚣要把朝鲜“从地图上抹掉”的不是朝中方面，正是美国自己。美国提出的荒谬提案中不知羞耻地口口声声谈论日内瓦公约，但是美国却至今也不肯批准这个公约。因此，联合国大会应该谴责的不是朝中方面，而是不仅不肯批准反而肆意破坏日内瓦公约的美国。可是，联合国大会倒行逆施，对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和许多国际组织提给联合国的许多调查报告书和抗议书竟置之不顾，不闻不问，而对于美国用心险恶、胡乱捏造的诬蔑报告却唯命是听，百依百顺。联合国大会的这种行动，是在联合国的可耻记录中又添上了新的一章。
    第八届联合国大会通过这个诬蔑提案的前后情形，证明了美国企图用这种偷天换日的手段，反诬朝中方面，掩饰其在朝鲜的滔天罪行的可耻作法，是不得人心的。当美国第一次发表诬蔑朝中方面犯有所谓“暴行”报告以后，许多国家都表示冷淡和反对。在这种情况下，美国一面竭尽全力捏造更加可耻的所谓“暴行”报告，并且指使其宣传机器大做广告，无耻地吹嘘甚么“惊人”文件；一面对其他国家施加压力，拖它们下水。但是事情仍进行得并不如意。美国原先穷凶极恶地叫嚣着要迫使联合国大会对朝中方面采取“最强硬不过的行动”，后来不得不悄悄地改为要联合国大会表示“严重关怀”。虽然如此，美国提出的这个提案仍然遭到许多国家的冷淡和不满。在美国强使联合国大会辩论其诬蔑朝中方面的提案时，除了遭受苏联和人民民主国家代表的严正斥责外，其他不少国家的代表也表示不感兴趣，不是没有出席会议，便是出席了也不发言。在表决这个提案时，有十个国家弃权，印度则表示不参加投票。同时，美国新闻处在美国提出这个提案以后，曾急急忙忙地打电报给世界各地的分支机构，要求他们“尽快摘录一些可用的较好的社论和任何官方的反应”，企图为美国的这个荒谬提案捧场。但是结果竟如石沉大海。
    十分明显，美国挟持联合国大会通过诬蔑朝中方面的提案，不但决不能掩饰美国在朝鲜犯下的铁证如山的血腥罪行，而且再一次玷污了联合国，使人们日益看清联合国已经堕落为美国进行冷战、制造国际紧张局势的顺从工具。
