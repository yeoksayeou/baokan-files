    Eternal Friendship
    Czechoslovakia I. Čermák
    Ten years ago today, on December 12, 1943, the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Post-War Cooperation between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union was signed in Moscow. At that time, Comrade Gottwald, who was in Moscow, was the leader of the Czechoslovakian resistance movement against the Nazi occupiers. He believed that this treaty was one of the most important turning points in the history of the Czechoslovak Republic. This treaty was fully in line with the wishes of the Czech and Slovak nations. The Czechoslovak people still clearly remember that the only country that did not recognize the Munich Pact was the Soviet Union. Moreover, as long as the Czechoslovak bourgeois government at that time had made the decision to defend the motherland, the Soviet Union was ready to assist Czechoslovakia in resisting Nazi aggression at any time.
    Since the signing of the Czechoslovak-Soviet treaty in 1943, the Czechoslovak people's ideal of striving for national freedom and independence has been realized. The Czechoslovak-Soviet treaty gave the Czechoslovak people guarantees that they could never have obtained from any Western country. The bourgeois government of the former Czechoslovak Republic failed precisely because it sold itself to these Western countries. The Czechoslovak people firmly believed that their motherland would inevitably be liberated and that the independence of their motherland would inevitably be restored. At the same time, the Czechoslovak people expected that their liberation would inevitably come from the East, and that the new republic would be a country without exploiters and traitors, and a government without lurking anti-Soviet conspirators.
    The Czechoslovak government-in-exile, headed by Beneš, which was living in comfort in London at the time, naturally took a completely different position. It hoped that the British and American armies would liberate Czechoslovakia, and that after liberation, it would restore the decadent capitalist system. Therefore, Beneš was very unhappy about the signing of this treaty and stubbornly believed that after the Soviet army's victory, everything that had been agreed with the Soviet Union would be unreliable. This small group of bourgeois elements who were living comfortably in London had ulterior motives and planned to sabotage the close relationship between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, attempting to prevent this relationship from achieving anything, whether during the war or after. But the Czechoslovak-Soviet treaty quickly took effect and decisively helped the victorious development of the liberated Czechoslovak state.
    When the war was about to end, the Soviet army and the Czechoslovak army, which had been established in the Soviet Union, entered the territory of Czechoslovakia side by side. On May 9, 1945, Soviet tank forces liberated Prague. In Czechoslovakia alone, 138,000 Soviet heroes sacrificed their lives for the liberation of Czechoslovakia. It was these Soviet liberators who sacrificed their precious lives to open up the road to development for the Czechoslovak Republic.
    In the early days after the end of the war, Soviet aid came continuously. The hungry citizens of the major cities received a large amount of urgently needed grain from the Soviet army, followed by continuous shipments of raw materials, iron ore, cotton, and so on from the Soviet Union. These things were all sent to rescue us and to alleviate the difficulties encountered in restoring the national economy that had been destroyed by the war. Although the enterprises established by the Nazis during the war were war trophies belonging to the Soviet army, the Soviet Union generously and selflessly gave them to the Czechoslovak Republic free of charge. These enterprises included the extremely important synthetic gasoline factory later named after Stalin.
    When the Czechoslovak working people were threatened with starvation due to crop failure in 1947, the Soviet Union's assistance to us was of historical significance. Thanks to Stalin's personal concern, the Czechoslovak people at that time received grain and feed assistance from the Soviet Union. And the Soviet Union's assistance to Czechoslovakia's national economic construction was even more extensive. The Soviet Union supplied raw materials, machinery, and machine-manufacturing equipment. The Soviet Union provided us with technical assistance and also sent technical experts, production innovators, and advanced producers to Czechoslovakia to help with construction. Without the Soviet Union's assistance and experience, the Czechoslovak people would not have been able to successfully complete the Five-Year Plan. The Czechoslovak Republic could not have smoothly embarked on the road to socialism without the guidance of the Soviet Union's advanced experience. Thanks to Soviet assistance and the continuous development of trade relations with the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia's industrial output will increase to twice its pre-war level by the end of this year. The living standards of the broad masses of the people are also constantly improving with the development of production.
    Czechoslovakia is no longer dependent on Western capitalist countries. Czechoslovakia has become a completely independent and autonomous country in both political and economic terms; it is vastly different from those countries that have accepted the "gift" of the Marshall Plan. Now, the Western countries' pursuit of any economic discrimination policy dictated by American monopoly capitalists cannot stop Czechoslovakia from moving forward on the road to socialism.
    According to the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Post-War Cooperation between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union has provided Czechoslovakia with a strong guarantee against the threat of West German revanchism. The Czechoslovak army, which was established according to the example of the Soviet army, is an ally of the invincible heroic Soviet army and a defender of its motherland and the cause of world peace.
    Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union have also established close cooperative relations in cultural undertakings such as science, art, education, and sports. The Soviet Union's achievements in science, literature, drama, film, and other fields are examples that Czechoslovak culture should learn from. Czechoslovakia's cooperation with the Soviet Union in culture and other fields is growing stronger. This year's Czechoslovak-Soviet Friendship Month fully proves this point. The activities of the Czechoslovak-Soviet Friendship Month will continue until the tenth anniversary of the signing of the Czechoslovak-Soviet Friendship Treaty.
    Soviet assistance is enormous and selfless. The Czechoslovak working people understand very well who they should thank for bringing them a happy life. Recently, a large number of granite stones were transported to Prague for the construction of the Stalin Memorial Tower. This memorial tower will proudly show to future generations the love and gratitude of all the Czechoslovak people for the Soviet people of all nationalities. This majestic granite memorial tower is a symbol of the eternal and ever-developing friendship between the Czechoslovak people and the Soviet people.

    永恒的友谊
    捷克斯洛伐克  伊·切尔玛克
    十年前的今天，即一九四三年的十二月十二日，在莫斯科签订了捷苏两国的友好、同盟及战后合作条约。当时在莫斯科的哥特瓦尔德同志是捷克斯洛伐克国外反抗纳粹占领者运动的领袖，他认为这项条约是捷克斯洛伐克共和国历史的极重要的转捩点之一。这项条约完全符合于捷克和斯洛伐克民族的愿望。捷克斯洛伐克人民还清楚地记得，当时唯一不承认慕尼黑专横决定的是苏联。而且，只要当时捷克斯洛伐克的资产阶级政府通过保卫祖国的决定，苏联是随时准备来援助捷克斯洛伐克反抗纳粹的侵略的。
    自从一九四三年捷苏条约签订以后，捷克斯洛伐克人民争取自己民族自由和独立的理想是实现了。捷苏条约使捷克斯洛伐克人民获得了在任何时候、从任何西方国家所不能获得的保障。捷克斯洛伐克前共和国资产阶级政府就是因为卖身投靠这些西方国家才遭受了失败。捷克斯洛伐克人民坚信自己的祖国必然要获得解放，祖国的独立必然要得到恢复。同时，捷克斯洛伐克人民期待自己的解放必然来自东方，而新的共和国将是一个没有剥削者和卖国贼，政府中没有潜伏的反苏阴谋家的国家。
    当时在伦敦苟安的以贝奈斯为首的捷克斯洛伐克流亡政府当然完全是另外一个立场。它指望英国和美国军队来解放捷克斯洛伐克，而在解放后的国家内，将由它来重新恢复腐朽的资本主义制度。因此，贝奈斯很不乐意于这项条约的签订，并且顽固地认为：在苏联军队胜利以后，所有与苏联谈好的一切都会是不可靠的。苟安在伦敦的这一小撮资产阶级分子心怀叵测，计划阴谋破坏捷克斯洛伐克与苏联的亲密关系，企图使这种关系无论在战时或战后都不能取得任何成就。但捷苏条约很快便生效了，并决定性地帮助了解放后的捷克斯洛伐克国家的胜利发展。
    当战争快要结束的时候，苏联军队与在苏联境内建立的捷克斯洛伐克军队，并肩进入了捷克斯洛伐克的领土。一九四五年五月九日苏联的坦克部队解放了布拉格。仅仅在捷克斯洛伐克境内，为解放捷克斯洛伐克而牺牲的苏联英雄就有十三万八千人。正是这些苏联解放者牺牲了自己的宝贵生命才为捷克斯洛伐克共和国开辟了发展的道路。
    战争结束的初期，苏联的帮助就源源不绝地来了。各大城市饥饿的市民获得了苏联军队所赠给的大量的急需粮食，紧接着又从苏联不断运来大批原料、铁矿砂及棉花等等。这些东西都是运来解救我们，恢复被战争破坏了的国民经济所遭到的困难的。尽管纳粹在战时所建立的企业是属于苏军的战利品，但苏联还是慷慨无私地、无偿地赠给了捷克斯洛伐克共和国。这批企业中包括后来以斯大林为名的极为重要的人造汽油工厂。
    当一九四七年捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民因歉收而遭到饥饿威胁的时候，苏联给我们的帮助是具有历史意义的。由于斯大林亲自的关怀，捷克斯洛伐克人民当时从苏联获得了粮食和饲料等援助。而苏联对于捷克斯洛伐克国民经济建设方面的帮助是更为广泛的。苏联供应了原料、机器、机器制造装备，苏联给我们以技术援助，另外还派技术专家、生产革新家和先进生产者到捷克斯洛伐克来帮助建设。如果没有苏联的援助和经验，捷克斯洛伐克人民是不能胜利完成五年计划的。捷克斯洛伐克共和国如果失去了苏联先进经验的指导，就不可能顺利地走向社会主义的道路。由于得到苏联的帮助和与苏联贸易关系的不断开展，捷克斯洛伐克的工业产量到今年年底将增加为战前的两倍。广大人民群众的生活水平也随着生产的发展而在不断地提高着。
    捷克斯洛伐克从此不再依赖于西方资本主义国家了。捷克斯洛伐克无论在政治和经济方面都已成为完全独立自主的国家了；它和那些接受了马歇尔计划“恩赐”的国家比较起来，真有着天壤之别。现在，西方国家奉行美国垄断资本家所授意的任何经济歧视政策，都阻挡不了捷克斯洛伐克走向社会主义的前进道路。
    根据捷苏友好、同盟及战后合作条约，苏联使捷克斯洛伐克获得免于西德复仇主义威胁的有力保障。按照苏联军队范例而建立起来的捷克斯洛伐克军队是不可战胜的英雄的苏联军队的同盟者，是自己祖国和世界和平事业的保卫者。
    捷克斯洛伐克与苏联在科学、艺术、教育和体育等文化事业方面也建立了亲密的合作关系。苏联在科学、文学、戏剧、电影及其他方面的成就是捷克斯洛伐克文化应该学习的榜样。捷克斯洛伐克与苏联在文化及其他方面的合作正在日益加强。今年举行的捷苏友好月便充分证明了这一点。捷苏友好月的活动要直到捷苏友好条约签订十周年纪念日这一天才告结束。
    苏联的帮助是巨大的、慷慨无私的。捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民很好地了解到应该感激谁给自己带来了幸福的生活。最近，布拉格运来了大批花岗石，这是用来修建斯大林纪念塔的。这座纪念塔将向下一代骄傲地表示出全体捷克斯洛伐克人民对苏联各族人民的敬爱和感激的心情。这座庄严巍峨的花岗石纪念塔，是捷克斯洛伐克人民与苏联人民永恒不渝、日益发展的友谊的标志。
