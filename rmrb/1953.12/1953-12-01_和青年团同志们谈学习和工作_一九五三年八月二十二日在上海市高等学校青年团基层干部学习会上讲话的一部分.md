Talking about Learning and Work with the Comrades of the Youth League

(1) The Relationship between Studying Politics and Studying Professional Skills

Comrades want me to talk about the relationship between studying political theory and studying professional skills. I think this should be considered separately for two types of people. One type is those who specialize in political work, such as doing Party work, political work in the military, etc., for whom political work is their profession. They must work hard to study Marxism-Leninism, study Chairman Mao's works, and they should study philosophy, history, political economy, the experiences of communist parties in various countries, and even read many literary and artistic books, etc., so that they have rich social science knowledge and strive to become experts in Marxism-Leninism. Only in this way can they correctly grasp the Party's guidelines and policies and lead the masses. Of course, this does not mean that someone doing political work, doing Party work, does not need to absorb specialized business and technical knowledge such as industry and agriculture. On the contrary, those doing political work, doing Party work, should also learn the necessary related business and technical knowledge. Only in this way can they better carry out their leadership work. But for them, studying politics is still the most important thing. The other type of people are those engaged in other professions, such as mechanics, mathematics, physics, chemistry, drama, etc. For them, the main thing is to study their profession well and strive to become specialized talents proficient in their own industry. Only in this way can they meet the needs of national construction in various fields. Of course, they must also study Marxism-Leninism, study the basic theoretical knowledge of Marxism-Leninism, so that they establish a correct worldview and outlook on life, study Chairman Mao's works, and study the Party's various policies. Only in this way can they become cadres with both ability and integrity needed by the country, and only then can they better engage in their own professional work. But they should not be required to carry out too much political study, which would hinder their advanced studies in their profession.

Currently, some of us have deviations in our understanding of the relationship between political study and professional study. One is to replace professional study with political study, denying the importance of specialized professional study; the other is to oppose political study and professional study, rejecting necessary political study. Both of these understandings are wrong and harmful.

Those who do political work must understand the importance of specialized skills. Some comrades demand that everyone engaged in a profession be proficient in both their profession and become an expert in Marxism-Leninism, which is impossible. Requiring everyone to learn everything and do everything will inevitably lead to being unskilled in everything and doing everything poorly. We must never have the same learning requirements for technical experts as we do for cadres doing political work. For example, after an air force fighter pilot has undergone political study and understands who he should defend and who he should attack, which are the basic principles he must understand, the serious task before him is to master the technology of piloting and aerial combat, to be able to shoot down the enemy, and not be shot down by the enemy. If he abandons studying aviation technology and only studies politics, but is shot down by the enemy, then what politics is there? What our country lacks today are specialized talents in various fields, such as industry, agriculture, national defense, culture and art, etc. If our Party, in addition to having a group of experts in Marxism-Leninism, also has millions of experts and specialized talents in various fields, China's socialist construction can achieve complete success; otherwise, it will still be impossible to build socialism. Therefore, do not use politics to negate technology. The higher a person's level of Marxism-Leninism, the more they should understand the importance of technology.

Comrades engaged in professional work must also understand the importance of politics. Comrade Stalin said at the 18th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks): "The cultivation and formation of our young cadres usually proceed according to individual scientific and technological departments, according to various specialized knowledge. This is necessary and appropriate. There is no need for a medical expert to also be a physicist or botanist; and vice versa. But there is one branch of science that all Bolsheviks in all branches of science must possess, and that is Marxism-Leninism, the science of society, the laws of social development, the laws of the development of the proletarian revolution, the cause of socialist construction, and the victory of communism. Those who are limited to their own specialized knowledge, such as mathematics, botany, or chemistry, and see nothing other than their own specialized knowledge, cannot be regarded as true Leninists even if they call themselves Leninists. A Leninist must not only be an expert in the science he loves, he must also be a politician and social activist, actively concerned about the fate of his country, understand the laws of social development, be good at applying these laws, and strive to become an active participant in the political leadership of the country. Of course, this is an additional burden for Bolshevik experts. But it is a promising burden." We should accept Comrade Stalin's teachings well.

The bourgeoisie monopolizes politics and turns around to spread the poison of despising politics or being apolitical to the working people. We should disinfect this point and organize good political study. But on the other hand, some people attempt to replace technology with politics, which is also a violation of the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint. Comrades doing political work should focus on studying politics and understand business as much as possible; comrades doing professional work should focus on studying business and also must study politics and possess a certain degree of basic political knowledge, so as to combine the two well.

(2) Studying Theory and Ideological Remolding

Studying Marxist-Leninist theory is itself a process of ideological struggle, a process of transforming class standpoints, viewpoints, and ideological qualities, and also a process of exercising ideological methods. Strictly speaking, a person's mistakes in understanding, over time, will affect their character. We study theory mainly to learn to look at problems from the proletarian standpoint, viewpoint, and ideological method; only by being able to correctly understand problems can we have correct actions. Therefore, the central issue of studying theory is to remold thinking and improve thinking. The purpose of learning is for practice, not to read a few books and increase one's vocabulary and fashionable terms.

Studying theory does not mean that our minds are a blank sheet of paper, an empty house, and we just need to move Marxism-Leninism in. We have all grown up in the old society, and we have all brought more or less the influence and prejudices of bourgeois thought, which occupy or still remain in our minds. These thoughts play a role of "first impressions," often hindering us from accepting proletarian thought. We study Marxist-Leninist theory to drive out the various non-proletarian thoughts in our minds, mainly bourgeois thought, and let Marxism-Leninism occupy and expand its position. The more Marxism-Leninism we accept, the more we can squeeze out bourgeois thought; and the cleaner bourgeois thought is eliminated, the greater the effectiveness of our work will be. Comrade Stalin said: "In any department of state work and party work, the higher the political level and Marxist-Leninist consciousness of the staff, the higher the work itself, the more effective it is, and the more effective the results of the work; conversely, the lower the political level and Marxist-Leninist consciousness of the staff, the more delays and failures in the work, and the more the staff themselves will become short-sighted petty people, degenerating into opportunists who only seek immediate interests, and the easier they will degenerate and change their colors - this is a theorem." If proletarian thought dominates our minds, we will not make big mistakes; but if bourgeois thought still dominates, then we will become spokespersons for the bourgeoisie. Studying Marxist-Leninist theory is to carry out ideological struggle, and a person's level of political consciousness and the quality of their political character depend on the extent to which ideological struggle is carried out.

Currently, the main antagonistic ideological system reflected on China's ideological front is bourgeois thought. We should be clear about this and not relax our vigilance. Some comrades are not afraid to say that they have petty-bourgeois thought when examining themselves, but they are afraid to say that they have bourgeois thought. In fact, petty-bourgeois thought is something attached to the bourgeois ideological system. Petty-bourgeois thought is essentially bourgeois thought. For example, some comrades are unwilling to do hard work and hope to be assigned to easier work, get higher positions, and have better treatment. These selfish, profit-seeking ideas of emphasizing status and treatment are manifestations of bourgeois individualism. Bourgeois thought cannot be eliminated overnight. If we are determined to engage in the revolutionary cause for a lifetime, then we must constantly carry out ideological struggle throughout our lives. This is also true for a worker comrade. We cannot say that in the old society, that is, in the encirclement of strong bourgeois thought, a worker comrade can naturally and completely refuse to be eroded by bourgeois thought. This is not in line with the facts. We must be aware of this and strive to eliminate the influence of bourgeois thought in the process of studying theory. I emphasize this to everyone because I have personal experience. When we were young, before we came into contact with Marxism-Leninism, we learned the bourgeois stuff and admired bourgeois figures. Later, we learned Marxism-Leninism and underwent arduous training in revolutionary life, and only then did we gradually begin to eliminate the bourgeois thought we were contaminated with.

During the period of national economic construction in New China, private industry and commerce still have a positive role in developing production in construction, and many industrialists and businessmen (i.e., national bourgeois elements) are useful talents. If they are trained and educated, their enterprises and their talents can be used to serve national construction well. Therefore, we should strive for them to actively participate in national construction. This is also the bright path they should take. This is part of our Party's united front policy, which is correct, but it must not be understood as meaning that we can accept bourgeois ideas. On the contrary, we must criticize and overcome bourgeois ideas in order to correctly implement the policy of winning over and transforming the bourgeoisie.

Overcoming bourgeois thought and establishing proletarian thought is the primary task of our study of Marxism-Leninism and theory. Comrades, you have only recently joined the Party and the League, so you must work hard to study Marxist-Leninist theory and transform the bourgeois thought in your minds. Only in this way can you become useful talents for national construction.

(3) How to Carry Out Work According to the Characteristics of Youth

How to carry out work according to the characteristics of youth is an old problem that has always existed in our country's youth work. I myself used to be a member of the Youth League and engaged in the youth movement, and I encountered this problem at that time. In the past, there were no sufficient conditions to solve this problem. Now, the Second National Congress of the Youth League has raised this issue and requires the entire League to pay attention to it and solve it, which is timely and correct.

Youth who grew up in semi-colonial and semi-feudal old China are easily precocious politically; many young people participated in the revolution before they were adults and engaged in national affairs, which has profound social reasons. The fate of the country and the nation forces youth to be precocious. Precociousness has its advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is that youth have not lagged behind in the revolutionary cause for the past thirty years. For example, during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, there were many teenagers in the army, whose height was not even as high as the barrel of the gun, but they picked up guns and charged to fight the enemy, and young comrades of twelve or thirteen years old also served as orderlies, contributing to the victory of the Chinese revolution; most of the cadres of our Party and army are young people, many of whom have been members of the Youth League and have done a lot of work, which is extremely good and glorious. The disadvantage is that the energy and physical strength of young people are consumed early, which can easily lead to premature aging, and the preparation of various knowledge is incomplete. Many of our old cadres are in poor health, which is also caused by this; the fact that we must now make up for cultural lessons is also caused by this. Currently, among the cadres of the Youth League, especially middle-level and above leaders, their work style is not active, rigid, likes quiet, and does not like to move, which is an example of the above reasons. Reflected in youth work, it shows that their work is not good at adapting to the characteristics of youth. Young people's interests are different from those of adults, and young people's various states are in the process of upward growth, while adults tend to be fixed. In order to do a good job in youth work, it is necessary to take care of and target this characteristic to carry out the work. It is necessary to provide young people with various correct knowledge with distinction, cultivate a free discussion and free research atmosphere in spare time and after work, provide various help according to the specific situation of each young person, and organize cultural and sports activities in a planned and appropriate manner. However, it is also necessary to oppose a misunderstanding, that is, to regard the tendency to sink into cultural and entertainment activities as being able to adapt to the characteristics of youth in work. Comrades who do Youth League work, even if we are a little older, should also interact more with young people, study their psychology and demands, serve as tutors for young people's studies, and carry out work from the actual situation of young people. The tasks of the League work should be combined with the life of the youth to carry out, do not only take care of the task and ignore the youth life, and become a top-down apportionment; the League work is often not done well in this.

We must pay special attention to the health problems of young people. Many young people do not pay attention to their bodies, they often do not know the importance of health, eat things randomly, sleep less, and feel that it does not matter, which is not right. People like this will regret it when they reach forty or fifty years old and their physical strength cannot support it. Young people do not have the right to ruin their health, and young people's health must be responsible to the Party, the country, and the people. It is not easy to cultivate a politically or professionally mature cadre, and it generally takes about ten to twenty years. If you do not pay attention to your body in your youth, the growth of your body will be limited after the age of twenty-five, and when you reach the age of thirty or forty, you are already relatively mature politically or professionally, and the Party and the people need you to take on more important work, but if your body has already been damaged and you cannot work well, this is a great loss.

To improve your health, you must carry out sports and cultural activities, and you must also pay attention to rest. The great Lenin said: "If you can rest properly, you can study and work twice as hard." We should develop good work and life habits and make life very regular. We should do gymnastics every day to invigorate our body and mind and improve our health. We should also educate young people to pay attention to cleanliness and hygiene and to be polite. It is also wrong for some of our young comrades to not pay attention to cleanliness and hygiene and not understand etiquette. They think that not paying attention to clothing and not being polite are characteristics of revolutionaries, which is a completely wrong idea, which is to uglify revolutionaries. Liking cleanliness and hygiene, paying attention to etiquette, respecting the elderly, caring for young children, being humble, not only thinking of oneself but also being able to think of helping others at all times, studying with a plan, and living in an orderly manner are the basic attitudes towards life and learning that young people in New China should have. All good habits in life are the life experiences accumulated by people all over the world for many years, and young people should learn and inherit them.

For young people, it is also very important to learn the language well. You must learn this business well before graduating from middle school, so as not to have to make up for culture later. Currently, some young people (including many college graduates) cannot write articles clearly, cannot speak clearly, and write sloppily so that people cannot understand them, mainly because they do not work hard in language learning and their work attitude is not serious. I don't think it is possible to write clearly and freely without hard work. Please imagine that a young person will express everything in his future decades of work through language, what reason is there not to take advantage of the middle school and university stage to study hard? I think that in the work of the Youth League, attention should be paid to helping young people in this regard. This is also very important.

To improve your health, it does not mean that you should not do a good job and study well, but that you should work well, study well, and be healthy, and combine these aspects of work, study, sports, rest, and sleep well.

Youth League cadres should guide the majority of young people to strive in the direction of "good health, good study, and good work" proposed by Chairman Mao.

    和青年团同志们谈学习和工作
    ——一九五三年八月二十二日在上海市高等学校青年团基层干部学习会上讲话的一部分
    陈毅
  （一）学习政治和学习业务的关系
    同志们要我谈谈学习政治理论和学习业务的关系。我认为这先要分别两种人的情况。一种是专门做政治工作的人，如做党的工作、部队政治工作等，他们是以政治工作为其专业的。他们必须努力学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛主席的著作，他们应该研究哲学、历史、政治经济学、各国共产党的经验，甚至阅读许多文学艺术书籍等，使自己具有丰富的社会科学知识，要求自己逐步地成为精通马克思列宁主义的专家。只有这样，他们才能正确地掌握党的方针、政策，领导群众。当然，这并不是说，一个做政治工作的人，就不需要吸收如工农业等项专门业务知识，恰恰相反，做政治工作的人，做党的工作的人，也要学习必须知道的有关的业务、技术知识。只有这样，才能更好地进行领导工作。但是对于他们说来，学习政治毕竟是主要的。另一种人，是从事其他方面职业的，如机械、数学、物理、化学、戏剧等等。对于他们，主要的就是学好业务，努力使自己成为精通本行业务的专门人材。只有这样，才能适应国家建设的各方面的需要。当然，他们也必须学习马克思列宁主义，学习马克思列宁主义的基本理论知识，使自己确立正确的世界观和人生观，学习毛主席的著作，学习党的各项政策。只有这样，才能使自己成为国家所需要的德才兼备的干部，也才能更好地从事自己的业务工作。但是不能要求他们进行过多的政治学习，妨碍了他们在专业上的深造。
    现在，我们有些人，对政治学习和业务学习的关系的认识，存在着偏差。一种是以政治学习来代替业务学习，否认专门业务学习的重要性；另一种是把政治学习和业务学习对立起来，拒绝必要的政治学习。这两种认识都是错误的、有害的。
    做政治工作的人必须懂得专门业务的重要。有些同志要求每一个从事专业的人，既精通专业，又要成为马克思列宁主义专家，这是做不到的。要求每个人样样都学，样样都干，其结果必然样样不专，样样做不好。我们对于技术专家的学习要求，和对一个做政治工作干部的学习要求，就决不能一样。譬如一个空军战斗员，在他经过政治学习，当他懂得了应该保卫谁和打击谁这个他所必须懂得的基本道理以后，放在他面前的严重任务，就是要精通驾驶和空中战斗的技术，要能把敌人打下来，而不要被敌人打下来。如果他离开了学习航空技术，光去研究政治，却被敌人打了下来，那还有什么政治呢？我们国家今天所缺乏的就是各方面的专门人材，工业的、农业的、国防的、文化艺术的等等。如果我们党在拥有一批马克思列宁主义专家之外，再有几百万的各方面的专家和专门人材，中国的社会主义建设就能达到完满的成功；否则，要建设社会主义仍旧是不可能的。因此，不要拿政治去否定技术。马克思列宁主义水平越高的人，就越应懂得技术的重要。
    做专业工作的同志，也要懂得政治的重要。斯大林同志在联共（布）第十八次代表大会上说过：“我们的年轻干部底培养和形成，通常都是按着个别科学部门和技术部门，按着各个专门知识来进行的。这是必要而且适当的。没有什么必要使得一位医学专家，同时又是一个物理学专家或植物学专家；反过来说也是一样。但有一个科学部门的知识，却是所有一切科学部门中的布尔什维克所必须具备的，这就是马列主义关于社会、社会发展规律、无产阶级革命发展规律、社会主义建设事业发展规律以及共产主义胜利的科学。那种局限于自己的专门知识，譬如说局限于数学、植物学或化学，而除了自己的专门知识以外，再也看不见其他什么东西的人，虽然他们自称为列宁主义者，也决不能视为真正列宁主义者的。列宁主义者决不能仅仅是他自己所喜爱的那门科学的专家，他同时还应当是政治家和社会活动家，积极关怀本国命运，通晓社会发展规律，善于运用这些规律，并力求成为积极参加国家政治领导工作的人。当然，这对于布尔什维克专家是一种附加的负担。但这是大有出息的一种负担。”我们应当很好地接受斯大林同志的这些教导。
    资产阶级垄断政治而掉转来对劳动人民散布轻视政治或超政治的毒素，我们针对此一点应该做消毒工作，应该组织很好的政治学习。但另一方面有人企图拿政治来代替技术，也是违反马克思列宁主义观点的。做政治工作的同志要以学习政治为主，尽可能了解业务；做专业工作的同志要以学习业务为主，同时也必须学习政治，具备一定程度的基本的政治知识，把两者很好地结合起来。
    （二）学习理论和思想改造
    学习马克思列宁主义理论本身就是思想斗争的过程，就是阶级立场、观点、思想品质转变的过程，也就是思想方法锻炼的过程。严格地说起来，一个人由于其认识的错误，久而久之，是会影响到他的品质的。我们学习理论，主要地是为了学会以无产阶级的立场、观点、思想方法来看问题；只有能够正确地认识问题，才能有正确的行动。因此，学习理论的中心问题是改造思想，提高思想，学习的目的是为了实践，并不是为了读几本书，使自己的谈吐增加名词、字汇和时髦的术语。
    学习理论，并不是说我们的头脑是一张白纸，一所空房子，只要把马克思列宁主义搬进去就行了。我们都是从旧社会里成长起来的，都或多或少地带来了资产阶级的思想影响和偏见，它们盘踞在或者还残留在我们的头脑中。这些思想起了“先入为主”的作用，往往阻碍着我们去接受无产阶级思想。我们学习马克思列宁主义理论，就是为了把头脑中以资产阶级思想为主的各种非无产阶级思想赶出去，让马克思列宁主义占领、扩大阵地。我们多接受一点马克思列宁主义，就能多把资产阶级思想挤掉一点；而资产阶级思想扫除得愈干净，我们进行工作的成效也就愈大。斯大林同志说过：“在国家工作和党工作任何一个部门中，工作人员底政治水准和马列主义觉悟程度愈高，工作本身也愈高，愈有成效，工作底结果也愈有效力；反过来说，工作人员底政治水准和马列主义觉悟程度愈低，工作中的延误和失败也愈多，工作人员本身也会愈加变为鼠目寸光的小人，堕落成为一些只图眼前利益的事务主义者，而他们也就愈易蜕化变节，——这要算是一个定理。”如果我们头脑中的无产阶级思想占了优势，我们就不会犯大错误；而如果资产阶级思想还占优势，那就会成为资产阶级的代言人。学习马克思列宁主义的理论是为了开展思想斗争，而一个人的政治觉悟之高低，政治品质之好坏，就要看思想斗争开展的程度而定。
    目前反映在我国思想战线上的主要的敌对思想体系是资产阶级思想，我们应该明确这一点，不要放松警惕，有些同志在检查自己时不怕说自己有小资产阶级思想，却害怕说自己有资产阶级思想。其实，小资产阶级思想是附属于资产阶级思想体系的东西，小资产阶级思想在本质上就是资产阶级思想，譬如有些同志不愿干艰苦的工作，希望分配做较容易的工作，得到较高的地位，有较好的待遇，这些自私自利、讲地位、讲待遇的想法就是资产阶级个人主义思想的表现。资产阶级思想不是一朝一夕所能排除的。我们如果决心干一辈子革命事业，那么在一生中就要不断地进行思想斗争。就是对一个工人同志来说也是这样，不能说处在旧社会中，即处在强大资产阶级思想的包围中，一个工人同志他就能天然地全能地拒绝受资产阶级思想的侵蚀，这样说是不合乎事实的。我们必须自觉到这一点，在学习理论的过程中努力清除资产阶级思想的影响。我向大家着重指出这一点，是有其切身体验的。我们在年轻的时候，还没有接触马克思列宁主义以前，那时学的都是资产阶级的一套，钦佩的都是些资产阶级人物，后来学了马克思列宁主义，经过革命生活的艰苦锻炼，才逐步开始去清除所沾染的资产阶级思想。
    在新中国的国家经济建设时期，私营工商业在建设中尚有发展生产的积极作用，工商业家中（即民族资产阶级分子）不少人系有用人材，如经过训练和教育，其企业、其人材均可利用来很好替国家建设服务，因此应该争取他们积极参加国家建设。对他们来说这也是他们所应走的光明道路。这是我党统一战线政策的一部分，这是正确的，但绝不能因此了解为我们可以接受资产阶级的思想，相反的，必须批判和克服资产阶级的思想，才能正确执行争取和改造资产阶级的政策。
    克服资产阶级思想，确立无产阶级思想，这就是我们学习马克思列宁主义、学习理论的首要任务。同志们都是入党、入团不久的，要努力学习马克思列宁主义理论，改造掉自己头脑中的资产阶级思想。只有这样，才能使自己成为国家建设的有用人材。
    （三）如何按照青年特点进行工作
    关于如何按照青年特点进行工作，是我国青年工作中历来就存在着的一个老问题。我自己也曾经当过青年团员，干过青年运动，那时就曾碰到这个问题。这在过去是没有充分条件来解决的。现在，青年团第二次全国代表大会提出了这个问题，并要求全团予以重视，加以解决，这是适时的，正确的。
    从半殖民地半封建的旧中国中生长起来的青年，在政治上很容易早熟；许多青年没有成年就参加革命，干与国家大事，这是有其深刻的社会原因的。国家和民族的命运逼迫青年早熟。早熟有它的好处也有它的短处。好处是在三十年来的革命事业中青年不落后，譬如第二次国内革命战争时期，部队里面有许多十几岁的青年，个子还没有枪杆高，便拿起枪冲锋打敌人，十二、三岁的小同志也当勤务员，为中国革命的胜利出了力；我们党与军队的干部多半是年轻人，许多人做过青年团团员，做了很多工作，这是极好的、极光荣的事体。短处是青年的精力、体力消耗得早，容易造成未老先衰，各项知识的准备不完全。我们很多老干部身体不好，也是这样造成的；到现在必须作文化补课也是这样造成的。现在青年团的干部中，特别是中级以上的领导人，他们的作风不活跃、呆板、喜静、不好动，便是上述原因的例证。这样反映在青年工作中，就表现其工作不善于适合青年的特点。青年人的兴趣与成年人不同，青年人的各种状态都是正处在向上生长的状态，而成年人每每趋于固定化。为了作好青年工作，必须照顾和针对此特点去进行工作。有区别地对青年们作各项正确知识的供应，在课余、工余培养自由讨论、自由研究的风气，根据每一个青年人的具体情况给以各项帮助，有计划地适当地组织文娱体育活动，均是必要的。但是也要反对一种误解，就是把沉没于文娱活动的偏向看成是工作上能适合青年的特点。我们作青年团工作的同志，即使我们的年龄稍大一点，也应该多和青年人来往，研究他们的心理和要求，担任青年学习的辅导，从青年人的实际出发来进行工作。团的工作任务应与青年的生活结合去进行，不要单照顾任务忽视青年生活，变成由上而下的摊派；团的工作做不好往往在此。
    我们要特别注意青年人的健康问题。许多青年人对自己的身体不注意，他们往往不知道健康的重要，乱吃东西，少睡一点，觉得无所谓，这是不对的。这种人到了四十、五十岁体力支持不住时，就要后悔莫及。青年人没有毁坏自己健康的权利，青年人的健康要对党、对国家、对人民负责。培养一个政治上或业务上成熟的干部是不容易的，一般的大约要经过十年至二十年左右的时间。如果在青年时期对身体不注意，过了二十五岁后身体的成长就受到限制，到了三、四十岁时，政治上或业务上已经比较成熟，党和人民也正需要你担负更重要的工作，但如果身体已经搞坏了，不能很好工作，这就是莫大的损失。
    要搞好身体，就要开展体育文娱活动，同时还要注意进行休息。伟大的列宁说过：“要是能够适当地休息，就可以加倍地学习和工作。”我们应当养成良好的工作与生活的习惯，使生活过得很有规律。我们要每天做体操，活跃身心增进健康。我们还要教育青年人讲清洁卫生，讲礼貌。我们有些青年同志不注意清洁卫生、不懂礼貌也是不对的。他们以为不注意衣著、不讲礼貌就是革命家的特点，这是完全不对的想法，就是把革命家丑化了。爱好清洁卫生，讲究礼貌，尊敬老年人，爱护幼童，自己谦虚，不仅想到自己而能时时想到帮助别人，学习很有计划，生活很有秩序，这是新中国青年人应具备的起码的对待生活与学习的态度。一切生活上良好的习惯，都是世界人民多年积累的生活经验，青年人都应学习和继承。
    对于学好语文，对青年人来说也是很重要的事。在中学毕业之前必须学好这一业务，省得以后去补习文化。现在一部分青年人（其中包括许多大学毕业生），文章写不通，讲话讲不清楚，写字潦草使人看不懂，主要是对语文学习不用功和工作态度不认真。我认为不用一番苦功要做到文章清通、书写自由是不可能的。请设想一下，一个青年人今后几十年一切工作要通过语文来表达，有什么理由不利用中学大学这一阶段去好好学习呢？我以为在青年团工作中应注意在这方面去帮助青年人。这也是很重要的。
    要搞好身体健康，并不是说不要做好工作、学好功课，而是要工作好、学习好、身体也好，把工作、学习与体育、休息、睡眠这几方面很好地结合起来。
    青年团干部应引导广大青年向毛主席所提出的“身体好、学习好、工作好”的方向努力。
