    Visiting Korea
    Japan, Kameda Togo
    The four advance representatives of the Japanese People's Delegation to Congratulate the Korean Armistice Peace and Friendship, headed by Professor Ikuo Oyama, Chairman of the Japan Council for the Promotion of Peace and winner of the Stalin International Peace Prize "For Strengthening International Peace," visited Korea with the aspirations and support of the Japanese people and the assistance of the Chinese people. This visit was at the invitation of the Korean National Committee for the Promotion of Peace.
    As the world knows, from 1910 until August 15, 1945, when Korea was liberated with the assistance of the Soviet Red Army, Japanese imperialism ruled Korea with extremely brutal colonial policies. In the past, only the rulers of Japanese imperialism visited colonial Korea. This time, however, peaceful and friendly envoys of the Japanese people visited the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the first time in the history of the two peoples. This result was achieved thanks to the birth of the People's Republic of China, the victory of the Korean armistice negotiations, the Japanese people's anti-imperialist and anti-fascist struggles, and the support of the world's peace forces led by the Soviet Union.

    Traces of Bombing
    From Andong to Sinuiju, there are two large iron bridges spanning the Yalu River. One of them has been repaired, but the blasted bridge railing of the other is still deeply embedded in the water. The buildings at Sinuiju Station have only reinforced concrete walls remaining, and the platform has neither a roof nor pillars. The cold wind of November blows fiercely from the Yalu River.
    Every city and every station between Sinuiju and Pyongyang was destroyed and burned to scorched earth. The rusted bodies of damaged iron bridges are half-buried in the river or sand. Bomb craters can be seen continuously on both sides of the railway between Sinuiju and Pyongyang. It is said that the number of bombs dropped was as many as the number of railroad ties.
    Pyongyang was also completely destroyed. The reinforced concrete buildings of the National Theater, the National Opera House, and the Mass Cinema were destroyed from the roof, walls, all the way down to the foundations. The schools were also burned down. I saw middle school students standing in the windy courtyard listening to their teacher's lecture.
    Although from the nature of the war, it is completely opposite and incomparable, we Japanese people have also experienced enough of the pain of bombing. I couldn't help but recall the scene of the scorched fields of Tokyo or Yokohama before and after Japan's defeat. However, in terms of the extent of the bombing, Pyongyang seems to be much worse. It is said that American imperialism dropped 420,000 to 460,000 bombs on Pyongyang. That is to say, one to three bombs were dropped on every citizen of Pyongyang.
    In the past, I had heard a lot about the inhuman atrocities of American imperialism, but until I witnessed them in person at the site, I did not expect them to be so cruel. American imperialism wanted to shatter even the corpses of people into pieces, leaving not a single tile on the houses, and showering bombs down like rain.

    Fighting and Reconstruction
    However, even such bombing failed to subdue the Korean people. Under the wise leadership of Marshal Kim Il-sung, the Korean people, closely united around the Korean Workers' Party and the government, fought valiantly side by side with the Chinese People's Volunteers. The peace-loving people of the world, led by the Soviet Union, wholeheartedly supported them at all costs.
    American imperialism, which boasted of its abundant material strength, appeared powerless in the face of the heroic Korean people. As the symbol of defeat became increasingly apparent, the effectiveness of their bombs also decreased. The bombs merely turned over the soil from underground, and the bombing only became a waste of material power. It was not the Korean people who were trembling with fear, but the American imperialists who could not feel at ease for a moment without bombing.
    Everywhere we encountered Korean people with shining eyes, rosy cheeks, and vibrant energy. They were full of new glory and confidence, especially expressed in their eyes. This is the image of the indomitable Korean people who have persevered in three years of fighting, and have been tempered and grown in the struggle.
    Korea began its reconstruction work at the same time as the armistice. The railway between Sinuiju and Pyongyang was opened to traffic eight hours after the armistice. At Xuancheon Station, I saw the Chinese People's Volunteers repairing the railway. Everywhere, there were lines of women transporting soil to repair the road. In front of a brand-new schoolhouse on a high hill, a group of elementary school students were playing games. Seeing that scene, one truly felt an indescribable warmth in one's heart. In Pyongyang, women wearing lipstick and light makeup also added color to the destroyed city.
    The mayor of Pyongyang explained to us the twenty-year plan to rebuild Pyongyang, to develop Pyongyang, which had a population of 240,000 after the armistice, into a modern peaceful city of one million people.
    The scenery of Pyongyang is very beautiful, with undulating hills of all sizes and the blue Taedong River flowing at the foot of the mountains. To build a brand-new city from the ruins of bombing in such a scenic place will be a matter of great joy for the Korean people! For peace-loving people all over the world, it is truly exciting and joyful news. Recovery, reconstruction, and the reunification of the motherland are the central slogans of the Korean people today. This forms a sharp contrast to the mad posture of American war-mongers who are plotting to undermine the political conference, expand the war, and conquer Korea.
    Currently, Pyongyang is working hard to build houses, schools, hospitals, factories, and theaters. In the West Pyongyang area, the roofs of a newly built residential area have already covered the land. On the hills near Moranbong, engineering teams are building a theater. The brick walls of the new station building at Pyongyang Station are already more than one meter high. 130,000 women are engaged in the reconstruction work of civil engineering. The reconstruction scene of New Pyongyang represents the reconstruction situation of the entire Korea.
    It is said that the destroyed factories and city streets are scheduled to be roughly restored within three years. This contains a firm confidence that peace can definitely be defended to the end. This struggle to restore the motherland will bring a great victory comparable to the victory of the war.
    However, as everyone can see at a glance, because the destruction is too severe, neither recovery nor construction is an easy task. Korea's reconstruction must start with building factories, and building factories must start with importing and producing equipment for building factories.
    I feel that not only the necessary construction equipment goes without saying, but even a piece of glass, porcelain, stationery, anything should be sent to Korea. Of course, the greatest assistance and the greatest obligation that we Japanese people should give to the Korean people is to drive the American troops out of Japan. Precisely because of this, I feel that at the same time, it is necessary to break through the obstruction of the American and Japanese reactionaries and open up the road for free, equal, and mutually beneficial cultural and economic exchanges with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. This is necessary for the reconstruction and construction of Korea and for the peace and independence of Japan.

    The Friendship of the Korean People
    On November 9th, we met the most beloved Marshal Kim Il-sung of the Korean people. Although he was very busy and was leaving the next morning to visit China, he still made time to meet with us.
    The Marshal spoke with us in a sincere and approachable manner. From the words of the Marshal, one could feel his infinite trust and expectations for the struggle of the Japanese people. Today, everyone clearly sees that the long-standing conspiracy of imperialism to alienate the Japanese and Korean nations has ended in failure.
    Before that, we met with Korean combat heroes at a symposium. We told them: "The Japanese people feel very sorry for the Korean people that they cannot completely prevent American bombers from taking off from Japan to invade Korea." And asked them: "What kind of feelings do the Korean people have towards the Japanese people?" An officer replied: "The Korean people have always trusted the Japanese people and look forward to and support the Japanese people's struggle against American imperialism for freedom, independence, and peace."
    All the Korean people trust the Japanese people like brothers and support the Japanese people's struggle. Everywhere we received warm welcomes from all the people. They showed their joy in welcoming us in their whole bodies. It can be said that there was not a single exception. Everywhere in Korea was filled with the beautiful spirit of internationalism.
    The greatest gain of our visit to Korea was that we personally felt and witnessed that the Korean people sincerely trust the Japanese people, look forward to and support the Japanese people's struggle.
    Our visit to Korea was on behalf of the Japanese people to convey our gratitude and congratulations to the Korean people for their heroic struggle and great victory, and to express to the Korean people our determination to fight together to defeat the common enemy—American imperialism. We received the hospitality of the Korean people, who had just achieved an armistice, that was difficult to describe in words, and at the same time, we learned a lot. We successfully completed our mission to visit Korea and opened up the road blockaded by the American and Japanese reactionaries. Only with the support of the world peace camp led by the Soviet Union, and with the strong unity of the people of Asian countries led by the Chinese and Korean people, can the Japanese people win independence, freedom, and peace. This will increasingly become the firm belief of all the Japanese people in the future. (Translated by Zheng Yingda) (With picture)

### 访问朝鲜

    访问朝鲜
    日本  龟田东伍
    以日本拥护和平委员会主席、“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金获奖人大山郁夫教授为团长的日本人民祝贺朝鲜停战和平友好代表团的四位先遣代表，在日本人民的热望和支持以及中国人民的援助之下，访问了朝鲜。这次访问是应朝鲜拥护和平全国民族委员会的邀请。
    举世皆知，从一九一○年至一九四五年八月十五日朝鲜在苏联红军援助下获得解放为止的长时期间，日本帝国主义曾以残暴无比的殖民地政策统治过朝鲜。过去，只是日本帝国主义的统治者访问过殖民地的朝鲜。而这一次，则是日本人民的和平友好使节访问了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，这在两国人民历史上是头一次。这是由于中华人民共和国诞生、朝鲜停战谈判胜利和日本人民反帝、反法西斯斗争等等力量，以及以苏联为首的全世界和平力量的支持才获得的结果。
    轰炸的痕迹
    从安东到新义州，有两座横跨着鸭绿江的大铁桥。其中之一已经修复好了，但是另一座的被炸断的桥栏仍深深地插在水中。新义州车站的房屋只剩下了钢骨水泥的墙壁，月台连顶棚和柱子都没有了。十一月的寒风猛烈地从鸭绿江上吹过来。
    新义州到平壤之间的每一座城市，每一个车站都被炸毁了，并且被烧成了一片焦土。炸坏了的生了红锈的铁桥桥身，半截埋在河水或泥沙中。在新义州到平壤间的铁道两侧，可以连续地看到炸弹的弹坑。据说投下的炸弹数量有枕木那么多。
    平壤也完全被破坏了。国立剧场、国立歌剧院、大众电影院的钢骨水泥的建筑物，从屋顶、墙壁一直到地基都被炸毁。学校也被烧毁了。我看见中学生们站在刮着风的院子里听先生讲课。
    虽然从战争的性质上看，是完全相反的，不可同日而语的，但是，我们日本人对于轰炸的苦痛也是体会得够深了，我不禁回忆起了日本战败前后东京或横滨的那一片焦土旷野的情景。然而就被轰炸的程度来说，平壤似乎要厉害得多。据说美帝国主义在平壤投下了四十二万至四十六万颗炸弹。这就是说，对平壤的每一个市民投下了一颗乃至三颗炸弹。
    过去我听过不少关于美帝国主义的惨无人道的暴行，但是直到在现场亲自目睹以前，还是没有想到有这样残酷的。美帝国主义是要想把人的尸首都炸得粉碎，把房屋炸得片瓦不留，而下雨一样地把炸弹倾注下来。
    战斗和复兴
    可是，虽然这样地轰炸也并未能使朝鲜人民屈服。朝鲜人民在英明的金日成元帅的领导下紧紧地团结在朝鲜劳动党和政府的周围与中国人民志愿军并肩地英勇作战。以苏联为首的全世界爱好和平的人民，不惜一切地衷心支持着他们。
    美帝国主义自夸丰富的物质力量，在英勇的朝鲜人民面前显得无力了。当失败的象征愈来愈显露的时候，他们炸弹的效力也就随着减低了。炸弹只不过是把地底下的土翻上来，轰炸仅仅成了一种物质力量的浪费而已。恐怖得发抖的不是朝鲜人民，而正是那些不轰炸就一刻也不能心定神安的美帝国主义者。
    我们到处接触到眼中闪着光辉、红光满面、朝气勃勃的朝鲜人民。他们充满了新的光荣和信心，特别从他们的目光中表现出来。这也就是胜利地坚持了三年的战斗，在战斗中锻炼和成长起来的不屈不挠的朝鲜人民的形象。
    朝鲜在停战的同时就开始了复兴的工作。新义州和平壤间的铁路在停战后八小时就通车了。我在宣川的车站上看到中国人民志愿军在修复铁路。到处是排着队的妇女们在运土修路。在高高的小山上的一所崭新的校舍前，一群小学生们正在做游戏。看到那种情景，真是使人心头感到一种说不出的温暖。在平壤，妇女们涂着口红，淡妆着，这也给被破坏的城市添了润色。
    平壤的市长给我们说明了复兴新平壤的二十年计划，要把停战后二十四万人口的平壤发展成为一百万人的近代化和平都市。
    平壤市的景色非常秀丽，大小山岗起伏，山麓下流着蓝色的大同江。在这样的名胜地方，要从轰炸的废墟中建设一座崭新的都市，这对于朝鲜人民来说，将是一件令人多么欢欣的事啊！这对于全世界爱好和平的人们来说，也真是一件使人兴奋愉悦的消息。恢复、建设和祖国的统一，是今天朝鲜人民的中心口号。这和美国战争贩子们阴谋破坏政治会议、扩大战争、征服朝鲜的疯狂姿态形成了一个鲜明对照。
    现在平壤正在致力建设住宅、学校、医院、工厂和剧院。在西平壤地区，一片新建的市民住宅的屋顶，已经掩盖着大地了。牡丹峰近旁的山岗上，工兵队们正在建筑剧院。平壤车站的新站房的砖墙已经砌了一公尺多高。十三万妇女正从事着土木建筑的复兴工作。新平壤的恢复情景正代表了全朝鲜的恢复情况。
    据说预定三年内把破坏的工厂与市街，大体恢复起来。这里面包含着一定可以保卫和平到底的坚决信心。这一复兴祖国的斗争，必将带来和战争胜利不相上下的伟大胜利。
    然而，大家都能一目了然的，因为破坏的太厉害了，所以不论是恢复、是建设，都决不是一件容易的事。朝鲜的复兴必须从建设工厂着手，建设工厂又必须从输入和生产建设工厂的器材开始。
    我感到，必需的建设器材自然不用说了，就是一块玻璃也好，瓷器也好，文具也好，什么都该送到朝鲜去。当然，我们日本人民对朝鲜人民应该做的最大的援助和最大的义务，是把美国军队赶出日本去。正因为如此，我感到同时要冲破美日反动派的阻挠，打通与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国进行自由平等互惠的文化经济交流的道路，这对于朝鲜的复兴建设以及日本的和平独立都是必要的。
    朝鲜人民的友情
    十一月九日那天，我们见到了朝鲜人民最敬爱的金日成元帅。虽然他非常忙，第二天早晨就要起程去访问中国，但他仍然特地抽出时间来接见了我们。
    元帅以一种诚恳可亲的态度和我们交谈。从元帅谈话的字句中都可以感到他对于日本人民的斗争寄与着无限的信赖和期待。今天，任何人都清楚地看到，帝国主义长期以来企图离间日本和朝鲜两民族的阴谋是以失败告终了。
    在这之前，我们在一个座谈会上见到了朝鲜的战斗英雄们。我们告诉他们说：“日本人民感到不能完全阻止美国轰炸机从日本起飞来侵略朝鲜，是一件非常对不起朝鲜人民的事。”并且问他们：“朝鲜人民对日本人民抱着什么样的情感？”一个军官回答说：“朝鲜人民一贯信赖日本人民并期待和支持着日本人民为了争取自由、独立、和平而与美帝国主义所进行的斗争。”
    全体朝鲜人民都如同兄弟般地信赖日本人民并支持日本人民的斗争。我们到处都受到一切人们热情的欢迎。他们全身表现出迎接我们的喜悦。真可以说是没有一个人例外。在朝鲜处处充满了美好的国际主义精神。
    我们访问朝鲜的最大收获是，亲身感到和亲眼见到了朝鲜人民在衷心地信赖日本人民，期待并支持着日本人民的斗争。
    我们访问朝鲜是代表日本人民传达对朝鲜人民的英勇斗争和伟大胜利的感谢和祝贺，及向朝鲜人民表示为打击共同敌人——美帝国主义而共同斗争的决心。我们受到刚刚停战的朝鲜人民的难以用文字形容的热情款待，同时也使我们学习到了很多东西。我们胜利地完成了访问朝鲜的使命，打通了美日反动派封锁的道路。唯有在以苏联为首的世界和平阵营的支持下，和以中国、朝鲜人民为首的亚洲各国人民坚强团结在一起，日本人民才能争取得独立、自由与和平，这在今后将愈来愈成为全体日本人民的坚决信念了。  （郑颖达译）（附图片）
