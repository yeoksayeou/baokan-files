Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 11th: Klamov published an article in "Pravda" commenting on the results of the Bermuda Three-Power Conference.

	Klamov pointed out: The first item on the agenda of the meeting (the attitude towards the Soviet proposal to hold a four-power foreign ministers' meeting) was initially unexpected by the participants. American and Western European newspapers unanimously believed that American diplomats, who drafted the Bermuda conference plan, wanted to force their partners to pretend that the issue of the Four-Power Conference was no longer a pressing issue. However, the Soviet government's note of November 26th exposed the deceptive tricks played by those who opposed the Four-Power Conference. This disrupted the American diplomatic plan. The American representative opposed accepting the Soviet proposal for a Four-Power Foreign Ministers' meeting. However, the movement of the broad masses of people in Britain and France to strive for the settlement of international disputes through consultation was so strong that the British and French representatives had to reject American pressure. It was Eisenhower and Dulles who were forced to make concessions.

	Klamov said: Agreeing to hold a meeting of the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in Berlin was the only positive decision made by the heads of the three governments in Bermuda. This decision conforms to the desire of the people of all countries to resolve outstanding issues through consultation. However, the American diplomatic authorities are not striving to achieve a satisfactory result at the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Meeting. American leaders predicted the development of the meeting, saying that the Berlin meeting would not resolve any disputes. At the same time, newspapers also said that in the next few days, the US, British, and French representatives would hold separate talks again to determine the "unified attitude" of the three countries towards Soviet diplomacy. In other words, the American diplomatic authorities hope to turn the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Meeting into a "bilateral meeting" that the United States loves very much.

	Klamov went on to write that we cannot ignore the fact that the American representative suggested holding the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Meeting precisely when France did not have a government with the power to make decisions. In this way, they unintentionally revealed that it was not in the interests of American diplomacy for France to have a plenipotentiary representative to participate in the Berlin meeting.

	American diplomacy miscalculated. It originally thought that as long as it deceptively publicized the so-called Soviet unwillingness to hold negotiations on the German issue, it could force France to quickly ratify the "European Army" treaty. The French parliament frankly stated at the end of November that it opposed the "European Army", thus making the French representative at the Bermuda Conference unauthorized to make any decisions on this issue. The French parliament has made it clear that it would rather resolve the German issue in four-nation negotiations than agree to divide Germany and allow the revanchist Bonn Republic to join the North Atlantic Group.

	From all indications, this meeting did not eliminate differences, nor did it eliminate the difficulties faced by the initiators of the "European Army." The final communique of the meeting clearly stated this. It specifically mentioned France's different attitude from the United States and Britain on the "European Army" issue. This meeting did not and could not eliminate the differences between the three major powers in their entire policy towards the Far East and Asia.

	The Soviet government has stated that it will raise the issue of immediately convening a five-power conference with the participation of the People's Republic of China at the Four-Power Conference. There was obviously a difference between the American representative and the British and French representatives on this statement. The American representative firmly insisted that the three Western countries should refuse any such proposal in advance. But the British and French delegations were unwilling to take this attitude. The final decision was that at the upcoming Four-Power Conference, any government participating in the conference can express its own opinions on this issue.

	Klamov concluded by writing: The Bermuda Conference once again proved that no serious international issue can be resolved by forcing other countries to accept the will of certain countries. International disputes can only be resolved through consultations among the countries concerned on the basis of mutual respect for each other's interests and rights.

    “真理报”载文评论百慕大三国会议的结果
   【新华社十二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十一日讯：克拉米诺夫在“真理报”发表文章，评论百慕大三国会议的结果。
    克拉米诺夫指出：会议上第一项议题（对苏联建议举行四国外长会议的态度）是与会者起初没有预料到的。美国与西欧报纸一致认为：拟订百慕大会议计划的美国外交官，想迫使他们的伙伴装出好像四国会议问题已经不再是当前迫切问题的样子。然而，苏联政府十一月二十六日的照会戳穿了反对四国会议的人所玩弄的骗人把戏。这样就打乱了美国外交的章法。美国代表反对接受苏联关于四国外长会议的建议。但是，英、法两国广大人民争取以协商方式解决国际纠纷的运动十分壮大，以致英、法两国代表不得不拒绝美国的压力。被迫让步的倒是艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯。
    克拉米诺夫说：同意美、英、法、苏四国外长在柏林举行会议，是三国政府首脑在百慕大作出的唯一积极的决定。这一决定符合各国人民要求用协商方式解决悬而未决问题的愿望。但是，美国外交当局并不努力去使四国外长会议得到圆满结果。美国领袖们预测会议的发展说，柏林会议将不能解决任何争执。同时，报纸还这样说：在今后几天内，美、英、法代表还要再进行单独会谈，来决定三国对苏联外交的“一致态度”。换句话说，美国外交当局希望把四国外长会议变成一个美国十分喜爱的“双方会议”。
    克拉米诺夫接着写道，我们也不能忽视这个事实：美国代表恰恰建议在法国没有一个有权决定问题的政府的时候来举行四国外长会议。这样，他们就无意中暴露出：法国有特命全权代表参加柏林会议并不符合于美国外交的利益。
    美国外交的如意算盘打错了。它原来以为只要欺世惑人地宣传所谓苏联不愿意就德国问题举行谈判，就能逼使法国迅速批准“欧洲军”条约。法国议会在十一月底坦白表明它反对“欧洲军”的态度，因而使得法国代表在百慕大会议上无权就这个问题作出任何决定。法国议会已经表明：它宁愿在四国谈判中解决德国问题，而不愿意同意分裂德国，让复仇主义的波恩共和国加入北大西洋集团。
      从一切迹象看来，这次会议并没有消除分歧，也没有消除“欧洲军”发起人面临的困难。会议的最后公报清楚地说明了这一点。它特别提到法国在“欧洲军”问题上和美国、英国不同的态度。这次会议不曾也不能消除三大国在对远东及亚洲的整个政策上的分歧。
    苏联政府曾说，它要在四国会议上提出立即召开有中华人民共和国参加的五大国会议的问题。对于这个声明，美国代表和英、法代表之间显然有分歧。美国代表坚决主张：三个西方国家事先就应拒绝任何这一类建议。但是英、法代表团不愿意采取这种态度。最后决定：在即将举行的四国会议上，参加会议的任何一个政府都能够在这个问题上发表自己的意见。
    克拉米诺夫最后写道：百慕大会议再一次证明，没有任何严重的国际问题能够靠强迫其他国家接受某些国家的意志的办法来解决。国际争端只能由各有关国家在互相尊重各方的利益和权利的基础上进行协商，才能得到解决。
