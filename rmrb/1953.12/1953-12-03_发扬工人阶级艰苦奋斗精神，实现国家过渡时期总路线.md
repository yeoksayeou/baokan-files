    Promote the Working Class's Spirit of Hard Struggle and Realize the General Line of the State During the Transition Period
    Chen Yongwen
    After achieving the great victory of the people's democratic revolution, the Chinese working class and the people of the whole country have entered a new historical period, that is, a period of gradual transition to a socialist society. Starting this year, our country has victoriously begun the first five-year construction plan, to steadily increase the proportion of socialist elements in the national economy, and to ensure the gradual realization of the general line of the transition period. To realize such a historical task, we must rely on the efforts of the people of the whole country, especially on the efforts of the working class itself. The broad masses of the working class in our country are engaged in an intense and enthusiastic production increase and economy practice campaign, striving with full confidence to guarantee the completion and over-fulfillment of the country's construction plan. However, it is undeniable that there are still a few workers who do not understand or do not fully understand their important responsibilities.

    Some workers think: "Since the national revolution has been victorious, the revolution has been successful, so why should we have to struggle hard?" Yes, the establishment of the People's Republic of China marks the victory of China's new democratic revolution. However, the victory of the new democratic revolution is by no means the final success of the revolutionary cause of the Chinese working class and the Chinese people. Comrade Mao Zedong taught us that "The historical process of the Chinese revolution must be divided into two steps, the first of which is the democratic revolution, and the second of which is the socialist revolution" ("On New Democracy"). After completing the first step, we must "continue to advance towards a socialist society and a communist society" ("On the People's Democratic Dictatorship"). Only when a socialist society and a communist society are realized, can the continuous improvement of the material and cultural life of the Chinese working class and the Chinese people be truly guaranteed.

    Some workers say: "Our production has been greatly improved, and the production quotas have been raised to the top. Why should we continue to work hard to increase production?" It is true that in the four years since the nationwide liberation, China's industrial and agricultural production has greatly improved compared with the period of reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. However, we must not be satisfied with this little achievement. We must not look backward, but must look forward. Before the victory of the national revolution, industry in our country accounted for only about 10% of the entire national economy; after the victory of the national revolution, after three years of economic recovery work, industry has only risen to more than 20%, which is still far from the level of socialist industrialization. Before the victory of the revolution, the Soviet Union was also an agricultural country, but at that time the proportion of industry in Russia was 42.1%. What Lenin and Stalin called the extremely backward Russia was actually more industrially developed than China is now. Therefore, we must never stop our demands at the backward level of the past.

    To gradually transform our country from a backward agricultural country into an industrial country with a high level of technology is an extremely arduous task, and we must still make great efforts. First of all, we must concentrate our main efforts on developing heavy industry. The 141 major projects that the Soviet government is helping us build are all very important heavy industries. Such as the newly built iron and steel companies, machine manufacturing factories, automobile manufacturing factories, oil refineries, coal mines, iron ore mines, power stations, etc. But each item requires the state to invest a large amount of funds. Where does such a large amount of money come from? According to the instructions of Lenin and Stalin and the experience of the Soviet people in implementing socialist industrialization, it is necessary to rely on the efforts of the working class and all working people to continuously increase production, practice strict economy, and accumulate a large amount of funds for the country to build socialist industry. The labor emulation campaigns constantly carried out by the broad masses of employees in our country since liberation, and the continuous emergence of innovations and rationalization proposals, have significantly improved the labor productivity of our country. In the past three years, the income of state-owned enterprises in our country has increased sevenfold, and has become the main source of funds for national construction. Taking the Northeast industrial sector as an example, in 1950, the funds invested in reproduction from internal industrial accumulation (including production funds, profits turned over to the state, and depreciation of fixed assets) accounted for 67.4% of the total national investment, and in 1951, the investment amount increased by 38.8%, and internal industrial accumulation even reached 95.6%. All of these are the result of the hard work, increased production, and economy practiced by the broad masses of employees.

    However, the current production quotas have by no means reached the "top", and labor productivity must be improved. Stalin said in his book "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" that "To ensure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society by means of continuous growth and continuous improvement of socialist production on the basis of high technology" is the main feature and requirement of the basic economic law of socialism. To realize socialist industrialization in our country, we must also require continuous growth and improvement of social production, and there will never be a "top" to stop our production development. Moreover, our current production level is still far from the socialist production level of the Soviet Union; our technical level is still very low, and needs to be greatly and continuously improved; our labor organization is not perfect enough, and needs to be greatly and continuously improved; the potential strength in every factory and mine enterprise is still very large, and needs to be greatly tapped and developed; and the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of employees are even more unlimited. From July last year to April this year, the small steel rolling mill of Anshan Iron and Steel Company carried out a mass mechanization and automation movement, carried out a series of transformations to production equipment, and increased labor productivity by 41.5%. Wei Yuxi, a lathe operator at the Jinxi Chemical Plant, improved his personal labor productivity by more than double by learning the working method of the Soviet lathe operator Kolesov. Wang Chonglun, a planer worker in the tool workshop of the Anshan Iron and Steel Machinery General Factory, improved his work efficiency by six and a half times by improving tools and learning from Wei Yuxi's advanced experience, saving auxiliary production time. There are many, many examples of this kind. Therefore, it is entirely possible to continuously improve labor productivity. The idea that production quotas have reached the "top" and that labor productivity can no longer be improved is a conservative idea that does not seek progress and does not believe in the creative power of the masses. Continuously improving labor productivity to continuously increase the accumulation of national industrial funds is the great responsibility of the working class of the whole country for the realization of socialist industrialization in our country. We must conscientiously study and promote advanced experience, especially the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, continuously improve our production technology and improve our labor organization, constantly consolidate labor discipline, and strive to continuously improve labor productivity.

    Some workers think: "Since we are liberated, life has improved; during the period of national construction, life should be even better, so why should we practice strict economy and struggle hard?" Since the national liberation, on the basis of the restoration and improvement of national production, the material and cultural life of employees across the country has indeed improved. This is the result of the hard work of the broad masses of employees, and it is also an important manifestation of the superiority of the people's democratic system. The ultimate goal of the working class revolution is to strive to realize the highest ideals of socialist society and communist society, which is to completely improve the lives of the working class and all working people. The ideal of a happy life in the future - the infinitely wonderful socialist and communist society - is by no means something that falls from the sky, nor can it be sent by others. It must be created by our own hard work. Experience has proved that only by first mobilizing the workers to complete the state production plan, increase the accumulation of enterprises and the wealth of the country, and continuously expand reproduction, is it possible to improve the material and cultural life of the workers. Any tendency to engage in welfare without production is empty talk and is wrong. Because no one can enjoy something that has not yet been produced; and even more so, we should not divide up and enjoy everything that has been produced. Of course, the material and cultural lives of the broad masses of workers need and should be improved as much as possible at present and during the construction period in the future; but it must be "to gradually improve the material and cultural lives of the workers and the working conditions of the workers on the basis of increasing production, according to necessity and possibility" (Liu Shaoqi's "Congratulatory Speech at the Seventh National Congress of Trade Unions of China"). We cannot and should not pursue excessive and excessive material welfare in the present. We must learn from the Soviet people's spirit of hard struggle in order to build a socialist society.

    We know that in order to carry out industrialization construction, the Soviet people concentrated their main efforts, especially accumulating a large amount of financial and material resources, as funds for industrial construction. During the period of national industrialization, although the Soviet people suffered from a shortage of agricultural products and daily necessities, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, they maintained and carried forward the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle, and finally overcame various difficulties. Surrounded by imperialism, they quickly built the Soviet Union into a socialist industrial country, thereby living a happier life day by day, and continuing to strive for the construction of communism. We must conscientiously learn from the Soviet Union, not only learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, but also learn from the great spirit of the Soviet people who struggled hard and overcome difficulties in order to realize the country's socialist industrialization.

    At present, the people of the whole country are responding to the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong to struggle for the implementation of the general line and general task of our country during the transition period. As the leading class of the country, the working class of our country must take practical actions to become a model for the people of the whole country in implementing this general line and general task. We must educate the broad masses of the working class about the general line and general task of the country during the transition period, so that the broad masses of employees understand the road of our country's progress, the tasks in a considerable period in the future, and the responsibilities that the working class should shoulder. To educate the broad masses of workers about the general line and general task of the country during the transition period is the most practical and most concrete communist education at present. We must tirelessly educate and influence the workers with the spirit of communism, combine the personal experience of the masses to continuously improve the masses ideologically, and combine the personal interests of the workers with the interests of all the people and the interests of the country. To continuously improve the consciousness of the broad masses of workers, continuously promote the enthusiasm and creativity of the working class, and continuously carry out the production increase and economy practice campaign, to ensure the completion and over-fulfillment of the country's construction tasks.

    It should be believed that the consciousness of the broad masses of employees is very high. As long as we explain the truth clearly, so that the broad masses of employees recognize the favorable conditions and various difficulties of the country during the construction period, they can consciously rise up, give full play to the favorable conditions, and overcome all difficulties. However, there are also a few comrades who do not understand this point. They do not quite believe in the consciousness of the masses, dare not explain the difficulties to the masses, dare not criticize some confused and wrong ideas that exist among a few masses, and dare not take out the correct measures of the Party and the country to solve certain specific problems to meet the masses, fearing that taking them out will affect the "interests" of the masses, hurt the "enthusiasm" of the masses, and make their work "passive". These views are obviously wrong.

    Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, under the hard struggle of the Chinese working class and the people of the whole country united as one, and with the strong assistance of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries and the working people of the world, we will definitely be able to overcome various difficulties and transform our country from a backward agricultural country into a happy, prosperous and strong socialist industrial country.

    发扬工人阶级艰苦奋斗精神，实现国家过渡时期总路线
    陈用文
    中国工人阶级和全国人民，在取得了人民民主革命的伟大胜利以后，就进入了一个新的历史时期，即逐步过渡到社会主义社会的时期。从今年起，我们的国家胜利地开始了第一个五年建设计划，要使国民经济中社会主义成份的比重稳步增长，要保证过渡时期总路线逐步实现。要实现这样一个历史任务，就必须依靠全国人民的努力，特别是必须依靠工人阶级自身的努力。我国工人阶级的广大群众，正在紧张热烈地开展着增产节约竞赛，充满信心地为保证完成和超额完成国家的建设计划而奋斗。但是，不可否认，也还有少数职工群众不了解或不十分了解自己的重大责任。
    有的工人群众这样想：“既然全国革命胜利了，就是革命成功了，何必还要艰苦奋斗呢？”是的，中华人民共和国的成立，标志着我国新民主主义革命的胜利。但是，新民主主义革命的胜利，绝不是中国工人阶级和中国人民革命事业的最后成功。毛泽东同志教导我们说：“中国革命的历史进程，必须分为两步，其第一步是民主主义的革命，其第二步是社会主义的革命”（“新民主主义论”）。在走完了第一步之后，必须“继续前进，向着社会主义社会和共产主义社会发展”（“论人民民主专政”）。只有实现了社会主义社会和共产主义社会，中国工人阶级和中国人民的物质生活和文化生活的不断改善才能得到真正的保障。
    有的工人群众说：“我们的生产已经大大地提高了，生产定额已经提到顶了，为什么还要努力不断地增加生产呢？”不错，全国解放四年多来，我国的工农业生产，比国民党反动统治时期来说，是大大地提高了。但是，我们决不能以这点成绩为满足。我们不能向后看，必须向前看。在全国革命胜利以前，我国工业在整个国民经济中只占百分之十左右；在全国革命胜利以后，经过三年来的经济恢复工作，工业也只上升到百分之二十多，距离社会主义工业化的水平还很远。苏联在革命胜利前也是一个农业国，但是当时俄国工业所占的比重是百分之四十二点一。列宁、斯大林称为极端落后的俄国，其实比我国现在工业发展的水平还要高。因此，我们绝不能把我们的要求停留在过去落后的水平上。
    要使我们的国家由落后的农业国逐步地成为具有高度技术水平的工业国，这是一个极其艰巨的任务，我们还必须作很大的努力。首先就要集中主要的力量来发展重工业。苏联政府帮助我们建设的一百四十一项巨大工程，都是非常重要的重工业。比如新建的钢铁公司、机器制造厂、汽车制造厂、炼油厂、煤矿、铁矿、电力站等等。但是无论那一项都需要国家投入大量的资金。这样大量的资金从那里来呢？按照列宁、斯大林的指示和苏联人民实行社会主义工业化的经验，就是要靠工人阶级和全体劳动人民的努力，不断地增加生产，厉行节约，为国家建设社会主义的工业积累大量的资金。我国广大职工群众解放以来不断开展的劳动竞赛，不断出现的创造发明、合理化建议，已使我国的劳动生产率得到显著的提高。在过去的三年中，我国国营企业的收入提高了七倍，已经成为国家建设资金的主要来源。单以东北工业部门为例，一九五○年靠工业内部积累（包括生产基金、上缴利润及固定资产的折旧费）投入再生产的资金占全部国家投资的百分之六十七点四，一九五一年投资额扩大了百分之三十八点八，工业内部积累更达到百分之九十五点六。所有这些，都是广大职工群众努力劳动，增产节约的结果。
    但是，现时的生产定额决没有到“顶”，劳动生产率还必须提高。斯大林在“苏联社会主义经济问题”一书中说：“用在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善的办法，来保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要”，这是社会主义基本经济法则的主要特点和要求。我国要实现社会主义的工业化，也必须要求社会生产不断地增长和完善，永远也不会有一个什么“顶”来停止我们生产的发展的。何况我们现在的生产水平距离苏联社会主义的生产水平还远得很；我们的技术水平还很低，还需要大大地和不断地提高；我们的劳动组织还不够完善，还需要大大地和不断地改善；在每一个厂矿企业中的潜在力量也还是很大的，还需要大大地挖掘和发挥；而广大职工群众的积极性和创造性则更是无限的。从去年七月到今年四月，鞍钢小型轧钢厂开展了群众性的机械化自动化运动，进行了一系列对生产设备的改造，使劳动生产率提高了百分之四十一点五。锦西化工厂车工韦玉玺由于学习了苏联车工科列索夫的工作法，使个人劳动生产率提高了一倍以上。鞍钢机械总厂工具车间刨床工人王崇伦，由于改进了工具和学习了韦玉玺的先进经验，节省了辅助生产时间，使工作效率提高了六倍半。这样一类的例子是很多很多的。因此，不断地提高劳动生产率是完全可能的。以为生产定额已经到“顶”了，劳动生产率再不能提高了的思想，是一种不求进步和不相信群众创造力量的保守思想。不断地提高劳动生产率以不断地增加国家工业资金的积累，是全国工人阶级对于实现我国社会主义工业化的重大责任。我们必须认真地学习和推广先进经验，特别是苏联的先进经验，不断地提高我们的生产技术和改善我们的劳动组织，经常地巩固劳动纪律，为不断地提高劳动生产率而斗争。
    有的工人群众以为：“解放了，生活就改善了；在国家建设时期，生活就更应该改善啦，为什么还要厉行节约，艰苦奋斗呢？”全国解放以后，在全国生产恢复和提高的基础上，全国职工的物质生活和文化生活也确实改善和提高了。这是全国职工群众努力劳动的结果，也是人民民主制度优越性的一个重要表现。工人阶级革命的终极目的，要为实现社会主义社会和共产主义社会的最高理想而奋斗，就是为着彻底地改善工人阶级以及全体劳动人民的生活。而未来幸福生活的理想——无限美妙的社会主义和共产主义社会，决不是从天上掉下来的，也不可能依靠别人给送来的，而是依靠我们自己的双手努力劳动去创造出来的。经验证明，只有首先发动工人群众完成国家生产计划，增加企业的积累和国家的财富，不断地扩大再生产，才有可能改善工人群众的物质生活和文化生活，任何离开生产去搞福利的倾向都是空谈，都是错误的。因为任何人都不可能享受到还没有生产出来的东西；更不应该把已生产出来的东西都分光去享受。当然，广大工人群众的物质生活和文化生活在目前和今后建设期间都是需要和应该尽可能地改善的；但是必须“在增加生产的基础上，按照必要与可能逐步改善工人的物质与文化生活和工人的工作条件”（刘少奇“在中国工会第七次全国代表大会上的祝词”）。我们在眼前就不可能也不应该去追求过分的和过高的物质生活福利。我们要学习苏联人民为了建设社会主义社会而艰苦奋斗的精神。
    我们知道，苏联人民为了进行工业化建设，曾经集中了主要的力量，特别是积累了大批的财力物力，作为工业建设的资金。苏联人民在国家工业化时期，虽然曾经遭受农产品和日用品不足的困难，可是在苏联共产党领导下保持了和发扬了艰苦奋斗的革命精神，终于克服了各种困难。他们在帝国主义包围当中，迅速地把苏联建设成为一个社会主义的工业国家，从而过着一天比一天幸福的生活，并且继续为着建设共产主义而奋斗。我们必须认真地学习苏联，不但要学习苏联的先进经验，而且要学习苏联人民为实现国家社会主义的工业化而艰苦奋斗、克服困难的伟大精神。
    目前，全国人民都在响应中国共产党中央和毛泽东同志的号召，为贯彻执行我国过渡时期的总路线和总任务而斗争。作为国家领导阶级的我国工人阶级，必须以自己的实际行动，成为全国人民贯彻执行这条总路线和总任务的模范。我们必须向全国工人阶级群众进行关于国家过渡时期的总路线和总任务的教育，使得广大职工群众了解我们国家前进的道路、今后一个相当长时期内的任务和工人阶级应该担负的责任。向广大工人群众进行关于国家过渡时期总路线和总任务的教育，是当前最实际的、最具体的共产主义教育。我们必须不疲倦地以共产主义的精神教育和影响工人群众，结合群众的亲身经验来不断地从思想上提高群众，把工人的个人利益与全体人民的利益和国家利益结合起来。以不断地提高广大工人群众的觉悟程度，不断地发扬工人阶级的积极性和创造性，不断地开展增产节约竞赛，来保证完成和超额完成国家的建设任务。
    应该相信，广大职工群众的觉悟是很高的。只要我们把道理说清楚，使广大职工群众认识到国家在建设时期的有利条件和各种困难，他们是可以自觉地起来，充分发挥有利的条件，战胜一切困难的。可是也有少数同志不了解这一点，他们不大相信群众的觉悟，不敢向群众说明困难，对于少数群众中存在的一些糊涂思想和错误思想不敢批判，对于党和国家解决某些具体问题的正确措施，迟迟不敢拿出来和群众见面，害怕拿出来会影响群众的“利益”，伤害群众的“积极性”，使自己的工作
  “被动”。这些观点显然是错误的。
    在中国共产党和毛泽东同志的英明领导下，在中国工人阶级和全体人民团结一致地艰苦奋斗下，在苏联和人民民主国家及全世界劳动人民对我们的大力援助下，我们是一定能够克服各种困难，把我们的国家，由落后的农业国变成一个幸福的富强的社会主义的工业国的。
