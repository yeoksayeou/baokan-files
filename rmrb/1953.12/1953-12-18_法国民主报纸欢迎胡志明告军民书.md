Xinhua News Agency, December 17th: According to a TASS dispatch from Paris on the 15th, Parisian newspapers published the recent letter from Ho Chi Minh, President of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, to the armed forces and people of the entire country. Democratic newspapers expressed great satisfaction with this message, emphasizing its significance for establishing peace in Southeast Asia.

    "L'Humanité" wrote: "What excuses can our ministers find to continue the Indochina War? Now, our government can no longer turn a deaf ear. Ho Chi Minh's position is clear, and his message reiterated this position." The newspaper pointed out that the war against the Vietnamese people only serves the interests of American imperialism, as it seeks to occupy the French colonists' territory in Indochina, and also the interests of the "dying clique" of Bảo Đại, because "only war can maintain their rule."

    "Libération" published an editorial commenting on Ho Chi Minh's message, demanding that the French government instruct Maurice Dejean, High Commissioner for Indochina, to immediately begin armistice negotiations with the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. "Libération" severely condemned the French government's stance on the Indochina War. The newspaper said: "From all appearances, it seems the French government has been deprived of the power to stop the war. Whose proposal is this astonishing prohibition, this intolerable veto?" The newspaper answered that it was "the proposal of the American rulers, who, in order to realize their desire to establish world domination, for their strategic considerations in Asia, demand that the French government continue the war in Indochina, regardless of how much blood is shed and how many francs are spent."

Xinhua News Agency, December 17th: According to a TASS dispatch from Paris on the 15th, French right-wing newspapers admitted that Ho Chi Minh's message regarding the possibility of ending the war through negotiations has caused panic among the Bảo Đại clique.

    "L'Armée" pointed out that "the question of negotiating with Ho Chi Minh" has placed the Bảo Đại regime in an extremely difficult position. "Paris Presse-L'Intransigeant" commented on Ho Chi Minh's message, saying that it "reiterates" Ho Chi Minh's position in response to the questions from the editor-in-chief of the Swedish "Expressen." The newspaper then described the situation of particular internal chaos within Bảo Đại's Vietnam as a result of Ho Chi Minh's message. The newspaper reported that the head of the puppet government, Nguyễn Văn Tâm, issued an ultimatum to Bảo Đại, requesting contact with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam given the possibility of peace talks. However, since Nguyễn Văn Tâm had not been able to persuade Bảo Đại, in the opinion of the newspaper, Nguyễn Văn Tâm's resignation was "imminent." The newspaper believed that the current situation within the Bảo Đại clique was an "internal crisis, which could endanger the Bảo Đại regime."

    "France Soir" wrote: "The contradiction mainly lies in the question of negotiations. Unlike Nguyễn Văn Tâm, Bảo Đại does not have a definite position on this issue, and he carefully avoids doing so... For Bảo Đại, the key to the problem depends on the positions of France and the United States, mainly on the influence of the United States on France. The United States is now clearly trying to influence France in order to interfere with the negotiations... Bảo Đại is counting on the United States to oppose France. It seems he has received assurances from the United States in this regard."

### 法国民主报纸欢迎胡志明告军民书

    法国民主报纸
    欢迎胡志明告军民书
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十五日讯：巴黎各报刊载了越南民主共和国政府胡志明主席最近的告全国军民书。民主报纸对这个文告表示非常满意，并着重指出它对建立东南亚和平的意义。
   “人道报”写道：“我们的部长们还能找出什么藉口来继续印度支那战争？现在，我们的政府不能再装聋作哑了。胡志明的立场是明显的，他的文告中重申了这种立场。”该报指出，反对越南人民的战争只符合于美帝国主义的利益，因为它想占据法国殖民者在印度支那的地盘；也符合保大这个“垂死的集团”的利益，因为“只有战争能使这个集团维持自己的统治”。
   “解放报”发表社论评述胡志明的文告，要求法国政府指令印度支那最高专员莫里斯·德让立即与越南民主共和国政府开始停战谈判。“解放报”严厉谴责法国政府对印度支那战争所采取的立场。该报说：“从一切情形看来，似乎法国政府被剥夺了停止战事的权力。这个令人惊奇的禁令，这种不可容忍的否决，是谁的主张呢？”该报回答说，这是“美国统治者的主张，他们为了实现建立世界统治的愿望，为了自己在亚洲的战略考虑，要求法国政府继续在印度支那进行战争，不管流去多少鲜血，化去多少法郎。”
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十五日讯：法国右翼报纸承认，胡志明关于可能通过谈判来停止战争的文告已引起了保大集团的慌乱。
   “义勇军报”指出，“与胡志明进行谈判的问题”使保大政权的处境极端困难了。“巴黎急进新闻”评论胡志明的文告说，这一文告“重申”胡志明答瑞典“快报”主编问的立场。该报接着叙述了保大越南由于胡志明的文告而引起内部特别混乱的情形。该报报道，傀儡政府的头子阮文心向保大提出通牒，由于看到和谈的可能性，要求保大与越南民主共和国进行接触。但是，既然阮文心没有能够说服保大，照该报的意见，阮文心的辞职已是“为期不远的事”了。该报认为保大集团内现在的情况是“内部危机，这种危机可以使保大政权受到危险”。
   “法兰西晚报”写道：“矛盾主要表现在谈判问题上。与阮文心相反，保大在这个问题上并没有一定的立场，他很小心地避免这样做……对保大来说，问题的关键是要取决于法国和美国的立场，主要是取决于美国对法国的影响。美国现在显然要影响法国，以便干涉谈判……保大指望美国反对法国。看来他在这方面已得到美国方面的保证。”
