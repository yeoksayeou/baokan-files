Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd: Tokyo dispatch: The illegal verdict rendered by the Sendai High Court in the second trial of the "Matsukawa Incident," according to the will of the US-Japan reactionaries, has aroused the angry protests of the Japanese people. The struggle of the Japanese people to restore the freedom of the victims and defend human rights has become even more intense.

Professor Ikuo Oyama, Chairman of the Japanese Peace Preservation Committee, issued a statement on the second trial verdict of the "Matsukawa Incident," saying: The people of the whole country believe that the defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" are innocent. Japanese cultural figures have reflected the public's indignation. The verdict in the "Matsukawa Incident" hinders Japan's freedom and prosperity and damages the dignity of the Japanese people. Oyama Ikuo pointed out: Japan's independence, especially the independence of the judiciary, has been violated by the US-Japan "Administrative Agreement." The freedom of the defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" is inseparable from the freedom of the Japanese people and national independence. The patriotic masses cannot tolerate the American "Rosenberg case" being repeated in Japan. The Japanese people must unite to oppose this verdict.

On the day of the second trial verdict in the "Matsukawa Incident," the broad masses of the Japanese people held protest rallies with indignant feelings. In Sendai City, the location of the Sendai High Court, thousands of people began gathering from as early as five o'clock in the morning, while it was still dark, waiting for the verdict they urgently expected to release all the defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident." Among the crowd were coal miners who had come all the way from Hokkaido. When the news of the High Court's unreasonable verdict was transmitted, people could not suppress their unparalleled indignation. They held spirited demonstrations in the city, protesting this absurd and shameless verdict. In Tokyo, angry people from all walks of life held protest rallies in many places, and many rallies continued until late at night.

Protest rallies were also held in many places such as Kyoto, Yokohama, Saga, Tsurumi, and Kamakura. The anger of the Japanese people has risen even higher. Kyodo News Agency admitted: "From now on, until the Supreme Court makes a final and definitive ruling, the defense movement inside and outside the court will become more and more intense."

Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd: Tokyo dispatch: The unreasonable verdict of the Sendai High Court on the defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" has been strongly condemned by the defendants' defense lawyers, who have filed an appeal with the Japanese Supreme Court on behalf of the defendants.

On the 22nd, when Judge Suzuki of the Sendai High Court read out the second trial judgment in the "Matsukawa Incident," the defendants' defense lawyers immediately pointed out sternly: "This verdict violates the facts." Defense lawyer Tatsuo Okabayashi issued a statement after the sentencing, saying: "This verdict protects barbaric torture and imposes the heaviest penalty on innocent workers. I vow to fight to the end for justice and humanity, and I believe that people all over the world will support us." Lawyer Shigetsugu Hakamada, a member of the Liberal Party, who joined the "Matsukawa Incident" defense team because of the absurdity of the first trial verdict, also said: "This is simply an unexpected verdict that greatly surprised me. ... Such a verdict cannot but lead me to conclude that the judges made a wrong judgment." Tatsuo Okabayashi and thirty other defense lawyers jointly filed an appeal with the Japanese Supreme Court on the same day that the Sendai High Court pronounced its verdict, demanding that the second trial verdict of the US-Japan reactionaries who framed innocent patriots be rejected.

  “行政协定”侵犯了。“松川事件”被告的自由是和日本人民的自由与民族独立分不开的。热爱祖国的人民群众不能容忍美国的“罗森堡事件”在日本重演。日本人民必须团结起来反对这个判决。
    在“松川事件”第二审判决日，日本的广大人民都怀着激愤的心情举行了抗议集会。在仙台高等裁判所所在地的仙台市，数以千计的人群从早晨五点钟天还未亮的时候起就开始聚集起来，等待着他们所迫切期待的释放“松川事件”全体被告的判决。在人群中，有远道从北海道来的煤矿工人。当高等裁判所作出蛮横判决的消息传到时，人们都不能抑制他们的无比愤慨，他们在市内举行了激昂的示威游行，抗议这个荒谬无耻的判决。在东京，愤怒的各界人民在许多处地方举行了抗议集会，有许多集会一直到深夜还在继续进行。
    京都、横滨、佐贺、鹤见、镰仓等许多地方也都举行了抗议集会。日本人民的怒愤已更加高涨起来。共同社承认：“今后在最高裁判所作出最后确定的判决以前，法庭内外的辩护运动将愈益猛烈。”
    【新华社二十三日讯】东京消息：日本仙台高等裁判所对“松川事件”被告的蛮横判决受到被告辩护律师的严词谴责，他们已代表被告向日本最高裁判所提出上诉。

  “松川事件”第二审判决书时，被告辩护律师当即严正指出：“这种判决违背了事实。”辩护律师冈林辰雄在宣判结束后发表谈话说：“这个判决包庇了野蛮的酷刑，竟对无辜的工人判以最重的刑罚。我立誓要为正义与人道而斗争到底，相信全世界的人们都会支持我们。”由于“松川事件”第一审判决的荒谬绝伦而参加“松川事件”辩护团的律师、自由党人袴田重司也说：“这简直是出人意外的判决，使我大吃一惊。……这样的判决不能不使我断定裁判官作了错误的裁判。”冈林辰雄等三十个辩护律师已在仙台高等裁判所宣判的当日联名向日本最高裁判所提出上诉，要求驳回美、日反动派陷害无辜爱国者的第二审判决。
