Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 22nd: The iron bridge project across the Han River, a component of the massive Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge project, commenced construction on November 27th after a lengthy period of preparation. This iron bridge will connect the Hankou and Hanyang sections of Wuhan City. The iron bridge project includes the bridge itself and the railway connecting lines at both ends of the bridge. One end of the connecting line will be linked to the Hankou Railway Station of the Jinghan Railway, and the other end will be linked to the Hanyang Railway Station to be built on the bank of the Yangtze River, extending the Jinghan Railway to the northern bank of the Yangtze River at the foot of Turtle Mountain in Hanyang. Then, through the bridge across the Yangtze River, which is being actively prepared for construction, the Jinghan Railway and the Yuehan Railway will be connected. After the Han River Iron Bridge and the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge are built, the three towns of Wuhan can be fully connected.

    The construction of the Han River Iron Bridge is also an important preparatory step for the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge project. According to the planned schedule, the Han River Iron Bridge will be completed before the official construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. At that time, a large number of construction equipment and materials will be smoothly transported from Hankou to the Hanyang bridgehead construction site of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. The construction of this iron bridge will also cultivate talents and accumulate experience for the Yangtze River Bridge project.

    In the past, the only means of transportation between Hankou and Hanyang was by small boat, and the flow of goods and passengers was extremely crowded; whenever there were strong winds or floods, the ferry service would be suspended. After the Han River Iron Bridge is built, people will be able to transport goods safely and smoothly across the bridge, no longer subject to natural restrictions. The ancient Hanyang area will also prosper as a result.

    The scale of this iron bridge project is quite large. Because the river is rapid and deep at the bridge site, and the low water season is very short, and the geology is alluvial quicksand, hundreds of concrete pipe piles, each 24 to 32 meters long, need to be driven under all the bridge piers. Therefore, the entire project, from driving pipe piles, removing mud from the riverbed bridge foundation, pouring concrete piers, to installing steel beams, will adopt mechanized construction methods as much as possible. At the Hankou bridgehead construction site, there is currently a construction team of several hundred people building the bridge foundation. Tens of thousands of cubic meters of loess needed for the bridgehead foundation are transported daily by special trains on the Jinghan Railway from more than 20 kilometers away. The towering universal hydraulic pile driver has begun to use the jetting method to send each concrete pipe pile, up to 30 meters long, into the water, so as to establish bridge abutments and piers on the solid pipe pile foundation. In order to complete the underwater pile driving and the construction of bridge piers and other foundation projects during the dry season, a complex and intensive underwater construction preparation work is actively underway. In recent days, huge crane ships and pontoons from Shanghai and other places have made the Han River appear narrow. The red "derrick" pole, which is more than 50 meters high, will also be erected on the bank of the Han River for lifting heavy machinery and equipment. High-voltage power lines and searchlights are being erected on both banks. Construction machinery and tools such as steam pile drivers, high-pressure water pumps, and automatic concrete factories have also been successively transported to the construction site. Soon, a bridge engineering team that built the Xiangjiang Bridge, and some professors and students from the Central South Institute of Civil Engineering and Architecture, will also come to participate in the arduous underwater project.

### 横跨汉水的铁桥工程开始动工

    横跨汉水的铁桥工程开始动工
   【新华社武汉二十二日电】规模巨大的武汉长江大桥工程的组成部分之一——横跨汉水的铁桥工程，经过长期的准备，已在十一月二十七日开工了。这个铁桥将把武汉市的汉口部分和汉阳部分连接起来，铁桥工程包括桥的本身和桥两端的铁路联络线。联络线的一端将和京汉铁路的汉口车站相联结，另一端将和长江边上将要兴建的汉阳车站相联结，使京汉铁路延伸到汉阳龟山脚下的长江北岸。然后，通过正在积极准备兴筑的横跨长江的大桥，使京汉铁路和粤汉铁路接轨。汉水铁桥和武汉长江大桥兴建后，武汉三镇也就可以全部连接起来。
    汉水铁桥的修建，同时也是武汉长江大桥工程的一个重要的准备步骤。按照预定计划，汉水铁桥将在武汉长江大桥正式施工以前完工。那时，大量的建筑器材和物资将从汉口顺利地运送到武汉长江大桥的汉阳桥头工地。这个铁桥的建设，并将为长江大桥工程培养人材，积累经验。
    过去，汉口和汉阳之间的唯一交通工具是扁舟划渡，往来货物和行人极为拥挤；一遇起大风或发水，就要停渡。汉水铁桥建成后，人们将可以安全而顺畅地从桥上往来运输，不再受到自然的限制。古老的汉阳地区也将因此繁荣起来。
    这个铁桥工程的规模相当大。因为建桥的地方水急流深，枯水期很短，加以地质是冲积层流沙，全部桥墩下面需要打下几百根二十四公尺到三十二公尺长的混凝土管桩。所以全部工程，从打管桩、清除河底桥基泥浆、浇灌混凝土墩台到安装钢梁，都将尽量采用机械化的施工方法。在汉口桥头工地上，目前有一支数百人组成的建筑队伍，正在建筑着桥梁基础。桥头基础所需要的黄土，每天都有上千万方，由京汉铁路上的专门列车从二十多公里外运来。高耸空中的万能水力打桩机已开始用射水沉桩的方法，把每根长达三十公尺的混凝土管桩送进水底，以便在坚固的管桩基础上建立起桥台和桥墩。为了争取在枯水季节中完成水下打桩和建筑桥墩等基础工程，一个复杂而紧张的水下施工准备工作正在积极进行。这几天，从上海等地驶来的巨大的起重船和趸船，已使汉水河面显得狭窄。高达五十多公尺的红色“德立克”把杆，也即将树立在汉水河畔，用以吊装重大的机械和器材。高压电线和探照灯正在两岸架设。蒸气桩锤、高压水泵和混凝土自动工厂等施工机械和工具也都陆续运到了工地。不久，建筑湘江大桥的一个桥梁工程队、中南土木建筑学院的一部分教授和学生，还要前来参加艰巨的水下工程。
