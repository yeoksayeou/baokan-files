Taking Labor Competition a Step Forward
Lai Ruoyu

Editor's Note: The Presidium of the Seventh Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions held its third meeting from October 13th to 15th this year. The meeting discussed the issue of increasing production and practicing economy, and labor competition. Comrade Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, delivered a speech at this meeting titled "Taking Labor Competition a Step Forward." The following is the full text of this speech.

This Presidium meeting only intends to resolve one issue, namely, increasing production and practicing economy—the issue of labor competition.

The issue of labor competition should be emphasized and studied based on the needs of two aspects. First, the Central Government calls for increasing production and practicing economy. We must respond loudly to the call of the Central Government and ensure the completion and strive for the overfulfillment of the first annual plan of the Five-Year Plan. If the first annual plan cannot be completed or is not completed well, it will affect the confidence of the workers and masses in the victory of the Five-Year Construction Plan. Conversely, if the first Five-Year Plan is completed very well, we will have a good start. To ensure the completion and strive for the overfulfillment of the national plan, we must launch a labor competition. Second, labor competition has emerged since liberation, but previous labor competitions were generally at a preliminary stage. Today, it is possible and completely necessary to take labor competition a step forward. Only by continuously promoting labor competition and making it a regular labor method for workers and masses can we confidently ensure the completion or overfulfillment of this year's and the entire Five-Year Construction Plan. How to take labor competition a step forward is the issue we should resolve.

Labor competition is a natural manifestation of the conscious and proactive labor enthusiasm of the working class after it becomes the leading class of the country. From the factory protection, takeover, inventory of materials, dedication of equipment, restoration of production, resistance against America and aid to Korea since liberation, as well as several movements to increase production and practice economy, this can be fully proven. However, most of the previous labor competitions were still in the preliminary stage. The main characteristics of the preliminary stage of labor competition are: focusing on strengthening labor intensity, with great impulsiveness and blindness, lacking organization and planning, and often paying insufficient attention to product quality and labor protection. Normal labor competition should be carried out in an organized and planned manner, focusing on improving production technology and labor organization, promoting advanced experience, tapping production potential to improve labor productivity, increasing the quantity and quality of products, reducing product costs, improving the operating environment and technical safety, and comprehensively completing or overfulfilling planned tasks. Of course, the initial labor competition also has its positive significance, and labor intensity should also be appropriately increased. At the same time, when the reform work of enterprises has not been basically completed, and we are still busy with enterprise reforms, it is impossible to concentrate on leading labor competition, and there are not enough conditions to take labor competition a step forward. But now it is different. After the "Three-Anti" Movement, the task of democratic reform of enterprises has been basically completed nationwide, and various industrial sectors have begun to implement planned management, production responsibility system, and economic accounting system. The work in various regions is gradually becoming balanced, that is, most factories and mines across the country have the possibility to truly shift from the reform movement to production. Trade union organizations are fully capable of adapting to the progress of production management and taking labor competition a step forward, and improving the entire trade union work and establishing a normal working order for trade unions according to the needs of normal labor competition. This is the urgent task of the current trade union work.

In the past year, especially since the Seventh National Congress of the Trade Union, the Trade Union has done a lot of work under the leadership of the Party and has achieved many results. However, from the development of the entire work, we are still in a transitional stage from the political reform movement to normal production (the transition from reform movement to regular production is a qualitative change). To smoothly end this transition and put the work on the right track as soon as possible, the central issue is to take labor competition a step forward, and solve other issues—the issue of the entire work order—around the labor competition.

Since the Seventh National Congress of the Trade Union, labor competition has made some progress compared with the past. Many factories and mines have paid attention to overcoming the blindness and impulsiveness in labor competition; paying attention to the improvement of production technology and labor organization; and paying attention to ensuring quality, reducing costs, and safe production. At the same time, collective contracts, especially production meetings, have also been adopted by many factories and mines and have gained some experience. According to these preliminary experiences, production meetings are an effective organizational form to attract the broad masses of workers to participate in enterprise management and carry out mass criticism and self-criticism to improve production.

However, it should be pointed out that trade unions still have many shortcomings in organizing mass production work—labor competition. The main ones are as follows:

First, the labor competition in most factories and mining enterprises is still at the level of general calls and challenge responses, lacking in-depth and meticulous organizational work, and lacking practical competition conditions (production plans)—clear goals. Therefore, the competition is often "a gust of wind," ending in a whimper, lacking sustained power.

Some trade union organizations do not study how to organize competitions, how to take labor competition a step forward, but just circle around in form, pursue new forms, and even the names of the competitions are very strange, such as "single competition," "Tiananmen Pointing General Platform divided into four stages," "Resisting America and Aiding Korea to Defend the Fruits of Victory," and so on. This phenomenon on the one hand shows that the "boom" style of leading political movements has not changed, and on the other hand, it also shows the "depression" of trade union cadres in leading labor competitions.

Second, many factories and mines have relaxed the work of promoting advanced experience. According to statistics from North China, last year, local state-owned cotton mills promoted the Hao Jianxiu work method and the "1951 Weaving Work Method," reaching 80 percent, but this year it has dropped to 30 to 40 percent. Last year, the Shanxi textile factories (Jinsheng, Jinhua) promoted the "1951 Weaving Work Method" to 85 to 100 percent, but this year even the better ones only reached 60 percent. The Fuziatan Coal Mine had five "long-wall mining" working faces last year, but now there is only one. The Shanxi Machine Factory's "multi-tool multi-edge cutting method" was promoted to 59 percent last year, but only eleven people are left this year. This decline is quite common. Why is there a "regression" trend in the promotion of advanced experience? There are roughly the following reasons:

1.  The past method of promoting advanced experience was a blitz. After the blitz, it was not made a regular work, and the achievements that had been made were not consolidated and improved. This formed a spontaneous flow and naturally slackened.

2.  There were originally false figures in the work of promoting advanced experience.

3.  Insufficient attention was paid to solving the specific difficulties in promoting advanced experience.

There are two shortcomings in the issue of rationalization proposals: one is that the proposals are not processed in a timely manner. For example, during the May competition in Shenyang, there were 8,641 large and small tips, but only one-third of them were processed. The second is that rationalization proposals lack a clear purpose. Many places, unlike Factory 53, do not propose topics based on key issues in production, and do not mobilize everyone to find tips to solve these problems around the topics. This forms the phenomenon of "tips running all over the street, but tasks cannot be completed."

Third, capitalist ideology is quite serious in labor competitions. This is manifested in two aspects: one is the false phenomenon. Individual cadres of factories and mining enterprises do not hesitate to adopt various bad deception methods in order to obtain honors. For example, Li Yonglu, a fake labor model in the railway system who was exposed last year, used to say that he "drove safely for 100,000 kilometers," but in fact, he did not have 10,000 kilometers of safe driving. This year, the railway system again exposed the leading cadres of the Mudanjiang Railway Factory for continuously falsely reporting achievements. The Gaocun Engineering Zone of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway used to be called the "National Railway Model Engineering Zone," but this glorious title was also obtained by deception. In the light industry system, Zhao Jun, the former factory director of the Shenyang Rubber Factory No. 4, Pan Ju, the deputy secretary of the Party general branch, Ding Hongtao, the deputy factory director, and Zeng Xianning, the chairman of the trade union, have been continuously falsely reporting achievements since 1951, and have defrauded the honors of "Model Factory" and "Light Industry Model Factory" in Shenyang. Although this type of phenomenon is only individual, its nature is extremely serious. It is an illegal act and must be resolutely opposed and corrected.

Another manifestation of capitalist ideology is the tendency of economism: the production mobilization work in some factories and mines lacks political and ideological content, and many of the slogans put forward are economistic slogans. Such as: "Produce well, bonuses are waving to you", "Over-produce to get more wages", "Find tips to get rewards" and so on. It is shocking that such slogans are still being put forward in factories after the enlarged meeting of the Party group of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. If the work is over-completed, material and honorary rewards should be given, but trade union workers should raise this reward to a political level to educate the masses, that is, emphasize the political significance of what he did, and his contribution to the country and the people, and should not lower our propaganda and mobilization work to the level of economism to adapt to some backward masses. This is another aspect of the manifestation of capitalist ideology.

Fourth, the work of contacting, cultivating, and educating labor models is far from sufficient, so many labor models have pride. Due to pride, some labor models have stagnated and become divorced from the masses. This is also a problem that must be seriously considered.

Some of our comrades always want to promote labor models to cadres. Generally speaking, this is inappropriate. We should cultivate labor models from production, and continuously improve them politically, culturally, and technically, so that they can overcome pride and complacency and truly become the backbone of production.

In short, the trade union's mass production work is far from sufficient. It not only lags behind the progress of administrative management, but also lags behind the enthusiasm of the masses, and cannot meet the requirements of the objective situation for us. Therefore, we must improve the leadership level of labor competition, take labor competition a step forward, and solve the order of trade union work around the labor competition.

Regarding the issue of labor competition, the Seventh National Congress of the Trade Union had a principled decision, the basic spirit of which is to continuously improve labor productivity, reduce product costs, improve product quality, and improve operating conditions and ensure production safety through labor competition. To achieve these requirements, we must pay close attention to the improvement of production technology and labor organization, and should not focus on physical strength. Such labor competition must be organized and planned, and cannot be spontaneous. Such labor competition can be a continuous and regular labor method, not a surprise movement. It should be pointed out that after the implementation of job plans in factories and mining enterprises, the goals (or conditions) of labor competition are more specific and clearer. The job plan should also be the goal or condition of the competition. This strengthens the organization and planning of the competition. Therefore, the job plan does not negate the competition, but is an important condition for the normal development of the competition.

Many trade union organizations have led labor competitions based on this understanding, so that labor competitions can be regularized. Their main method of mobilizing the broad masses to discuss national plans (indicators) or cooperate with enterprise administration to formulate and implement job plans is to guide the masses to launch mass rationalization proposal movements to find tips and tap potential, break through old quotas, transform national plans (production plans) into mass action programs, and formulate specific goals and guarantee measures for workshops, sections, groups, and individuals as competition conditions, and carry out regular labor competitions centered on ensuring the completion of national plans (or job plans) on this basis. Mass movements for rationalization proposals to find tips and tap potential will promote the enterprise administration to formulate advanced production plans—or practical job plans—within a certain period; it can also promote the smooth completion or over-completion of production plans by the workers and masses.

Strengthening planned management and promoting job plans is to strictly require factories and mining enterprises to comprehensively and evenly complete production tasks. Maintaining balance requires eliminating backward links so as not to affect the rhythmic progress of the entire production. To this end, it is also necessary to mobilize the workers and masses to find tips and tap potential to cooperate with the technical and organizational measures of the enterprise administration to ensure the implementation of the job plan. Only by continuously eliminating backward links can we continuously improve the labor productivity of our enterprises.

Some comrades believe that balanced production cannot carry out competition. This is a misunderstanding of balanced production. The so-called balanced production is to seek balance from the advanced production level, not to seek balance from the backward level. The balance of production is often broken, but that should not be due to backwardness, but should be due to advancement. When a certain link in production breaks through the current quota, other backward links should be quickly caught up to seek a new balance. In this way, advanced drives backward, production continues to advance, and labor productivity continues to improve.

At present, many factories and mines have paid attention to the improvement of production technology and labor organization in labor competitions, and the achievements of Anshan Iron and Steel are more prominent. Now, let me introduce the experience of Anshan as an example of taking labor competition a step forward.

Since Zhang Mingshan of the small rolling mill created the successful anti-encirclement disc last autumn, Anshan Iron and Steel Company has launched a mass technical improvement movement. From last autumn to July this year, the number of employees participating in technical improvement and submitting rationalization proposals accounted for 22% of the total number of employees. From September last year to July this year, during the ten months, the company reviewed and considered that 468 rationalization proposals could be adopted, and 299 of them have been successfully tested. Among these successful proposals, 51 increased production, 23 improved quality, 28 ensured safe production, 66 saved labor, 22 improved the operating environment, and 40 greatly reduced physical labor. These all meet the requirements of increasing production and practicing economy.

According to Anshan's experience (Factory 53 also has these experiences), to take labor competition a step forward, the following points need to be paid attention to:

First, it is necessary to carry out rationalization proposals, and the leadership must strongly support rationalization proposals. This support is not only spiritual encouragement, but also must actually provide many conveniences. Anshan Iron and Steel Company has some specific regulations on supporting employees' rationalization proposals:

1.  If the rationalization proposal submitted by the employee is considered valuable after preliminary research, it will be approved and given a certain trial production time. The wage during the trial production period shall not be lower than the actual average income of the employee in the previous three months.

2.  The technical improvement that is initially successfully trial-produced will be put into trial use in production after being reviewed and approved. In order to avoid the temporary reduction in output caused by imperfect technical measures or unskilled operation during the trial period, which affects the worker's piece-rate wages, it is stipulated that during the trial period, the wages of the operators shall not be lower than their average income in the previous three months.

3.  The raw materials, materials, and tools required for testing or trial production shall be allocated by the administration.

4.  For proposals to mechanize certain production processes, the administration will arrange construction forces.

5.  After each technical improvement is successful, workers will be organized to study and master new operating methods.

6.  When the production rationalization reduces the staffing, the reduced workers cannot be dismissed. They must be given new jobs and helped to master new technologies.

Such clear regulations on administrative leadership provide great support to employees.

The administration of Anshan Iron and Steel also actively supports the rationalization proposal committee led by the trade union. The rationalization proposal committee has become an organization to unite the broad masses of workers. Administrative support, coupled with the political work of the Party and the trade union, greatly promotes the initiative of workers and technicians, and combats conservative ideas and bureaucracy. This is how the rationalization proposal movement of Anshan Iron and Steel Company was carried out.

Second, it is necessary to attach importance to and do a good job in the work of veteran workers and technicians. Almost all major inventions and creations of Anshan Iron and Steel Company were initiated by veteran workers and technicians with more than ten years of service. It can be seen from this that veteran workers and technicians are the backbone of production. Only by mobilizing veteran workers and technicians can the actual production experience of workers be combined with the technical knowledge of technicians, can the technical level of workers be continuously improved, and can the technical foundation of our industry be continuously improved. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to strengthen the political work for technicians, establish their concept of serving the people, and the idea of valuing the practical experience of the masses. At the same time, it is also necessary to strengthen the technical education and cultural education of the workers, help them master new technologies, and improve their cultural level necessary for mastering new technologies.

To make labor competition regular, the work of staff in offices is also important. After the implementation of planned management, the role of office staff is more significant. If the office work is not done well, planned management will not be done well, and labor competition will inevitably be affected.

Many comrades in grassroots trade unions do not dare to do the work of technicians and office workers, believing that their culture and technology are not as good as others, and they cannot do their work. This situation must be changed. We are not comparing technology or culture with technicians and office workers, but doing political work to give play to their roles.

Third, there must be a correct reward system. Anshan Iron and Steel Company gives timely rewards for adopted rationalization proposals in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Heavy Industry. Fourth, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and obtain the assistance of Soviet experts. The above-mentioned experiences are very good, and we believe that they can be used as a direction for taking labor competition a step forward. It has now been decided to move the exhibition of Anshan Iron and Steel to Beijing for exhibition once, and promote its experience through this exhibition. Finally, let me talk about the order of the entire trade union work.

Taking labor competition a step forward is the central issue of the current trade union work. However, if there is no normal order in the grassroots and entire work of trade unions and factories and mines, and if the chaotic state of work cannot be overcome, it is impossible to truly take labor competition a step forward. Of course, this does not mean that we must first establish the working order of factories and mines before we can take labor competition a step forward. Rather, while carrying out labor competition, we must establish the normal working order of trade union work and the entire work of factories and mines around labor competition. The normal development of labor competition will help establish a normal working order, and the establishment of a normal order will ensure the normal and sustained development of labor competition, making it a regular labor method.

The order of trade union work can be rectified from three aspects: organizational, system, and working method.

Organizational aspect: Many grassroots organizations are not established one by one according to the development and needs of the work, so some organizations are still merely in form until now, and should be rectified according to the requirements of the work. Various factories and mines do not have to seek uniformity. At the same time, since an organization has been established, its responsibilities should be clearly defined and its work should be enriched.

System aspect: There are two most important issues, one is the meeting issue, and the other is the after-work activity issue. There are too many meetings, meetings are too long, the quality of meetings is not high, and cadres are busy with meetings and cannot go deep into workshops and groups. This is the problem. Therefore, various methods must be adopted to reduce meetings, shorten meeting times, and improve meeting quality.

Many after-work activities (technical learning, cultural entertainment, sports activities, various lectures, etc.) are mandatory. We propose to change the mandatory nature of these after-work activities to a voluntary system, that is, not to force the masses to participate with administrative power, but to attract the masses to participate with our correct work. Of course, this cannot be understood as weakening these works, but to seriously improve working methods and strengthen these works, because only by doing these works well can we attract the masses to participate, and the methods of attracting and persuading are the basic methods of trade union work. This voluntary system should be promoted step by step with emphasis.

Working method aspect: The working methods of political reform movements and blitz work have a profound impact on cadres and the masses. When our entire work truly shifts to production, this working method must be changed, and our work must be more in-depth, more specific, and more meticulous. No work should be just "mobilization." In addition to carrying out necessary general mobilization calls, it is more important to carry out specific organizational work, solve specific problems, and summarize experience in a timely manner, and grasp typical cases and promote them. The grassroots work meeting in December will further discuss the issue of working order.

The current trade union work is in a transitional stage from irregular to regular, and from political reform movement to production. To end this transitional stage as soon as possible, we should grasp the central link of labor competition and take labor competition a step forward. At the same time, with the development of labor competition, and in accordance with the requirements of labor competition, establish the normal working order and production order of factories and mining enterprises.

    把劳动竞赛向前推进一步
    赖若愚
    编者按：中华全国总工会第七届执行委员会主席团于今年十月十三日到十五日举行了第三次会议。会议讨论了增产节约和劳动竞赛的问题。中华全国总工会主席赖若愚同志在这次会议上作了“把劳动竞赛向前推进一步”的发言，下面是这个发言的全文。
    这次主席团会议只准备解决一个问题，即增产节约——劳动竞赛问题。
    根据两方面的需要，劳动竞赛问题是应该着重加以注意和研究的。第一、中央号召增产节约，我们必须响亮地回答中央的号召，保证完成并争取超额完成五年计划的第一年度计划。如果第一年度计划不能完成或完成得不好，就会影响职工群众对于五年建设计划的胜利信心。反之，如果第一个五年计划完成得很好，我们就有一个良好的开端。而要保证完成并争取超额完成国家计划，就必须展开劳动竞赛。第二、劳动竞赛是在解放以后就出现了的，但以往的劳动竞赛，一般是处在初级阶段。而今天却已经有可能也完全需要把劳动竞赛向前推进一步。只有把劳动竞赛不断地向前推进，使它成为职工群众经常的劳动方式，才能有把握地保证今年的和整个五年的建设计划的完成或超额完成。如何把劳动竞赛向前推进一步，这便是我们应该解决的问题。
    劳动竞赛，是工人阶级在成为国家的领导阶级之后自觉的、主动的劳动热情的一种必然的表现。从解放以后的护厂、接管、清点物资、献纳器材、恢复生产、抗美援朝以及几次的增产节约运动，完全可以证明这一点。可是，以往的劳动竞赛，大多还是处于初级阶段的。初级阶段的劳动竞赛的主要特点是：偏重于加强劳动强度，突击性盲目性很大，缺乏组织性和计划性，往往对产品质量和劳动保护注意不够。而正常的劳动竞赛则应当是有组织有计划地进行，应当着重于改进生产技术与劳动组织，推广先进经验，发掘生产潜力，以提高劳动生产率，提高产品数量和质量，降低产品成本，改善操作环境和技术安全，全面地完成或超额完成计划任务。当然，初期的劳动竞赛也自有其积极的意义，劳动强度也是应该适当提高的。同时，当企业的改革工作还没有基本完成，我们还忙于企业改革的时期，也不可能集中精力来领导劳动竞赛，更没有足够的条件把劳动竞赛向前推进一步。可是现在不同了。在“三反”运动之后，企业的民主改革任务在全国范围内基本上完成了，各工业部门又都开始实行了计划管理、生产责任制和经济核算制，各个地区的工作逐渐趋向平衡，即全国绝大部分厂矿都有可能由改革运动切实转到生产方面来。工会组织完全有可能与生产管理工作的进步相适应，把劳动竞赛向前推进一步，并根据正常的劳动竞赛的需要，来改进整个的工会工作，建立工会的正常的工作秩序。这是目前整个工会工作的迫切任务。
    工会在一年以来，特别是第七次全国代表大会以来，在党的领导下作了很多工作，也取得了不少成绩。但从整个工作的发展来看，我们依然处在由政治改革运动切实转向正常生产的过渡阶段（由改革运动到正规生产是一个质的变化）。要顺利地结束这种过渡，使工作早日走上正规，其中心问题是把劳动竞赛向前推进一步，并围绕着劳动竞赛来解决其他问题——整个工作秩序的问题。
    在中国工会第七次全国代表大会以来，劳动竞赛比过去有了一些进步，许多厂矿已经注意了克服劳动竞赛中的盲目性和突击性；注意了生产技术上和劳动组织上的改进；注意了保证质量、降低成本和安全生产。同时，集体合同、特别是生产会议也开始为许多厂矿所采用，并取得了一些经验。根据这些初步的经验来看，生产会议是吸引广大工人群众参加企业管理，开展群众性的批评与自我批评以搞好生产的一个有效的组织形式。
    但是应该指出，工会在组织群众的生产工作——劳动竞赛方面，还存在着很多缺点。主要的有以下几点：
    第一、多数厂矿企业的劳动竞赛，还是停留在一般号召和挑战应战的水平上，缺乏深入细致的组织工作，缺乏切合实际的竞赛条件（生产计划）—明确的奋斗目标。所以竞赛往往是“一阵风”，虎头蛇尾，没有持续力。
    有些工会组织不研究怎样组织竞赛，怎样把劳动竞赛向前推进一步，只是在形式上打圈子，追求新形式，就连竞赛的名称也是很奇怪的，有什么“单一竞赛”、“天安门点将台分四阶”、“抗美援朝保卫胜利果实”等等。这种现象一方面表现了领导政治运动时期的“轰”的作风还没有转变，另一方面也表现了工会干部在领导劳动竞赛中的“苦闷”状态。
    第二、许多厂矿放松了推广先进经验的工作。根据华北地区的统计，去年地方国营纱厂，推广郝建秀工作法和“一九五一织布工作法”，曾达到百分之八十，今年反而降到百分之三十到百分之四十了。山西的纺织厂（晋生、晋华），去年“一九五一织布工作法”推广到百分之八十五到百分之百，而今年比较好的也只达到百分之六十。富家滩煤矿“长壁式回采”的工作面，去年有五个，现在只有一个。山西机器厂“多刀多刃切削法”去年曾推广到百分之五十九，今年只留下十一个人了。这种下降的情况是相当普遍的。为什么推广先进经验的情况有“倒退”的趋势呢？大约有以下几个原因：
    一、过去推广先进经验的方法是突击，突击之后，没有使它成为经常工作，没有把已经取得的成绩加以巩固和提高，这样就形成自流，就自然松懈下来了。
    二、在推广先进经验的工作中原来就有虚假数字。
    三、对于解决推广先进经验中的具体困难注意不够。
    在合理化建议的问题上存在着两个缺点：一是处理建议不及时，如沈阳五月份竞赛中，出现大小窍门八千六百四十一件，而处理了的只占三分之一。二是合理化建议缺乏明确的目的，许多地方不是像五三厂那样，根据生产中的关键问题提出课题，围绕着课题发动大家找窍门来解决这些问题。所以形成“窍门满街跑，任务完不了”的现象。
    第三、劳动竞赛中资本主义思想相当严重。这表现在两方面：一方面是虚假现象，个别厂矿企业的干部为了骗取荣誉，不惜采取各种恶劣的欺骗手段。如去年揭发的铁路系统的假劳动模范李永禄，过去说他“安全行车十万公里”，实际上他没有一万公里的行车是安全的。今年铁路系统又揭发了牡丹江铁路工厂的领导干部连续假报成绩。沪宁铁路高资工区，过去叫“全国铁路模范工区”，可是，这个光荣的称号也是骗来的。在轻工业系统中，沈阳橡胶四厂的前任厂长赵均、党总支副书记潘巨、副厂长丁洪涛、工会主席曾宪宁等，从一九五一年起就连续假报成绩，骗取了沈阳市“模范厂”和“轻工业模范厂”的荣誉。这一类的现象，虽然只是个别的，但它的性质是极严重的，是一种犯法的行为，必须坚决地反对和纠正。
    资本主义思想的另一个表现是经济主义倾向：有些厂矿的生产鼓动工作缺乏政治性、思想性，提出的口号有许多是经济主义的口号。如：“好好生产吧，奖金向你招手了”、“超额生产多得工资”、“找窍门得奖励”等。全总党组扩大会议以后，在工厂里还提这一类的口号，这是惊人的。工作超额完成，应该给予物质的和荣誉的奖励，但是工会工作者应该把这种奖励提到政治上来教育群众，即强调他这样作的政治意义，他对国家和人民的贡献，而不应该把我们的宣传鼓动工作降低到经济主义的水平来适应一部分落后群众。这是资本主义思想表现的另一个方面。
    第四、对劳动模范的联系和培养教育工作做得非常不够，因而有不少的劳动模范存在着骄傲情绪。由于骄傲情绪，使得某些劳动模范停滞不前，脱离群众。这也是必须严重注意的一个问题。
    我们有些同志总想把劳动模范提拔成干部，一般地说，这是不恰当的。我们对于劳动模范应该是从生产中去培养，不断地从政治上、文化上、技术上去提高他们，让他们克服骄傲自满情绪，真正成为生产中的骨干。
    总而言之，工会的群众生产工作做得很不够，既跟不上行政管理方面的进步，也落后于群众的热情，更不能适应客观形势对我们的要求。所以，我们必须提高对劳动竞赛的领导水平，把劳动竞赛向前推进一步，并围绕着劳动竞赛解决工会工作的秩序问题。
    关于劳动竞赛这个问题，中国工会第七次全国代表大会曾有原则的决定，其基本精神是要求通过劳动竞赛来不断地提高劳动生产率、降低产品成本、提高产品质量，并改善操作条件，保证生产安全。为了达到这些要求，就必须十分注意生产技术与劳动组织的改进，而不应该是偏重于拚体力的。这样的劳动竞赛，必须是有组织、有计划的，而不能是自发的。这样的劳动竞赛才能够是持续的经常的劳动方式，而不是突击运动。应该指出，在厂矿企业实行作业计划之后，劳动竞赛的目标（或条件）是更加具体、更加明确了。作业计划同时应当是竞赛的目标或条件。这就使竞赛的组织性、计划性加强起来了。所以作业计划并不否定竞赛，而是使竞赛正常发展的一个重要的条件。
      许多工会组织正是根据这种认识领导了劳动竞赛，因而使劳动竞赛得以经常化。他们在发动广大群众讨论国家计划（指标），或配合企业行政制订与执行作业计划的主要方法，就是引导群众针对生产中的关键问题，展开找窍门、挖潜力的群众性的合理化建议运动，突破旧的定额，变国家计划（生产计划）为群众的行动纲领，并制订车间、工段、小组及个人的具体奋斗目标与各项保证办法，作为竞赛条件，在此基础上开展以保证完成国家计划（或作业计划）为中心内容的经常性的劳动竞赛。群众性的找窍门、挖潜力的合理化建议运动，会促使企业行政方面在一定时期内制订出先进的生产计划——或切实可行的作业计划；它也能够促使职工群众顺利地完成或超额完成生产计划。
    加强计划管理推行作业计划，就是严格地要求厂矿企业全面地、均衡地完成生产任务。保持均衡性就要消灭落后环节，不使其影响整个生产的有节奏的进行。为此，也必须发动职工群众找窍门、挖潜力配合企业行政的技术组织措施，以保证作业计划得以贯彻执行。只有不断消灭落后环节，才能使我们企业的劳动生产率不断提高。
    有的同志认为均衡生产就不能开展竞赛，这是对于均衡生产的误解。所谓均衡生产是向先进的生产水平求得均衡，而不是向落后的水平求得均衡。生产的均衡常常被破坏，但那不应该是由于落后，而应该是由于先进。当生产中的某一环节突破了现在的定额的时候，应该使其他落后了的环节很快地赶上，以求得新的均衡。这样地使先进带动落后，就使生产不断地前进，就使劳动生产率不断地提高。
    目前，在许多厂矿的劳动竞赛，已经注意了生产技术与劳动组织的改进，而鞍钢的成绩是比较突出的。现在，让我介绍一下鞍山的经验，作为一个把劳动竞赛向前推进一步的范例。
    自从去年秋天，小型轧钢厂张明山创造反围盘成功以后，鞍山钢铁公司就掀起了一个群众性的技术改进运动，自去年秋天到今年七月止，参加技术改进、提合理化建议的职工占职工总人数的百分之二十二。从去年九月到今年七月的十个月来，经公司审查认为可以采纳的合理化建议共四六八件，已经试验成功的有二九九件。这些成功的建议中有五一件是增加了产量的，有二十三件是提高了质量的；有二十八件保证了安全生产；有六十六件节省了劳动力；有二十二件改善了操作环境；有四十件使体力劳动大大减轻。这都是合乎增产节约的要求的。
    根据鞍山的经验（五三工厂也有这些经验），要把劳动竞赛向前推进一步，需要注意以下几点：
    第一、必须开展合理化建议，领导上对于合理化建议必须有力地予以支持。这种支持不仅仅是精神上的鼓励，而且要从实际上给以很多便利。鞍山钢铁公司对支持职工的合理化建议有一些具体规定：
    一、职工所提的合理化建议，经初步研究认为有价值者，即批准给予一定的试制时间。试制期间的工资不低于本人前三个月的实际平均收入。
    二、初步试制成功的技术上的改进，经审查批准后即在生产中试用。为避免试用期间由于技术措施上的不完善或操作上的不熟练所引起的暂时的产量降低，影响工人的计件工资，规定试用期间，操作工人的工资不低于其前三个月的平均收入。
    三、试验或试制时所需要的原料、材料、工具，由行政方面拨给。
    四、对于使某些生产过程机械化的建议，由行政方面安排施工力量。
    五、每一项技术改进成功以后，要组织工人学习，使他们掌握新的操作法。
    六、由于生产的合理化使定员减少时，被减少的工人不能辞退，要给他们新的工作，帮助他们掌握新的技术。
    行政领导上有这样明白的规定，对于职工是一个很大的支持。
    鞍钢行政上还积极地支持了工会所领导的合理化建议委员会。合理化建议委员会已成了团结广大职工群众的组织。行政支持加上党和工会的政治工作，就使工人、技术人员的主动性大大得到了发扬，使保守思想和官僚主义受到了打击。鞍山钢铁公司的合理化建议运动就是这样开展起来的。
    第二、要重视和做好老工人、技术人员的工作。鞍山钢铁公司所有重大的创造发明，几乎全部是十年以上工龄的老工人和技术人员倡议的。由这里可以看出，老工人和技术人员是生产中的骨干。把老工人和技术人员发动起来，才能使工人的实际生产经验与技术人员的技术知识相结合，才能不断地提高工人群众的技术水平，才能不断地改进我国工业的技术基础。为了达到这一目的，必须加强对于技术人员的政治工作，树立他们为人民服务的观点和重视群众的实际经验的思想。同时，也必须加强工人群众的技术教育和文化教育，帮助他们掌握新的技术，提高他们为了掌握新的技术所必需的文化水平。
    要使劳动竞赛经常化，科室人员的工作也是重要的。在实行计划管理以后，科室工作人员的作用比较显著了，科室工作做不好，计划管理就搞不好，劳动竞赛也必然要受到影响。
    有许多基层工会的同志，不敢做技术人员和职员的工作，认为自己的文化、技术不如人家，做不了人家的工作，这种情况必须改变。我们不是和技术人员、职员比技术、比文化，而是做政治工作，以发挥他们的作用。
    第三、必须有正确的奖励制度。鞍山钢铁公司对于采用了的合理化建议，都按照重工业部的规定，及时地给予奖励。第四、学习苏联的先进经验，取得苏联专家的帮助。以上几点经验是很好的，我们认为可作为把劳动竞赛向前推进一步的方向。现在已决定把鞍钢的展览会搬到北京来展览一次，通过这次展览，把它的经验加以推广。最后，再讲一下关于整个工会工作的秩序问题。
    把劳动竞赛向前推进一步，这是当前工会工作的中心问题。可是，如果工会基层和厂矿整个工作没有正常的秩序，如果工作上的混乱状态不能克服，就不可能真正把劳动竞赛向前推进一步。当然这并不是说要先建立厂矿的工作秩序，然后才能把劳动竞赛向前推进一步，而是在开展劳动竞赛的同时，要围绕着劳动竞赛，把工会工作和厂矿整个工作的正常秩序建立起来。劳动竞赛的正常发展，将有助于正常的工作秩序的建立，而正常秩序的建立，将会保证劳动竞赛的正常的持续的发展，使它成为经常的劳动方式。
    工会工作的秩序，可以从三个方面即组织方面、制度方面和工作方法方面加以整顿。
    组织方面：基层的许多组织不是根据工作的发展和需要一个一个地建立起来的，所以有些组织直至现在还是徒具形式，应根据工作的要求加以整顿，各厂矿也不必强求一致。同时，既然建立了一种组织，就要明确地规定它的职责，充实它的工作。
    制度方面：最重要的有两个问题，一是会议问题，一是业余活动问题。会议多、会议长、会议质量不高，干部忙于开会，不能深入车间小组，这就是问题。所以必须采取各种办法减少会议、缩短会议时间、提高会议质量。
    业余活动（技术学习、文化娱乐、体育活动、各种讲座等等）有许多是强制参加，我们提议把这些业余活动的强迫制改成自愿制，即不是以行政权力来强使群众参加，而是以我们正确的工作来吸引群众参加。当然这并不能理解为可以削弱这些工作，而是要认真地改善工作方法加强这些工作，因为只有把这些工作做好，才能吸引群众来参加，而吸引和说服的方法是工会工作的基本方法。这种自愿制，应该有重点地，逐步地加以推行。
    工作方法方面：政治改革运动、突击工作的工作方法，在干部和群众中都有深厚的影响，在我们的整个工作切实转向生产的时候，这种工作方法必须加以改变，必须使我们的工作更加深入、更加具体、更加细致。任何工作都不应当只是“动员”，除开进行必要的一般的动员号召之外，更重要的还要进行具体的组织工作，解决具体的问题，并及时地总结经验，抓住典型，加以推广。关于工作秩序的问题，十二月基层工作会议将进一步地加以讨论。
    目前的工会工作，正处在由不正规转向正规、由政治改革运动转向生产的过渡阶段，为了早日结束这个过渡阶段，我们应该抓住劳动竞赛这个中心环节，把劳动竞赛向前推进一步。同时，随着劳动竞赛的发展，并适应劳动竞赛的要求，把厂矿企业的正常工作秩序和生产秩序建立起来。
