    The Special Tribunal of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union, in accordance with the Criminal Law of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, sentenced the revolutionary traitor and imperialist spy Beria and his accomplices, such as Merkulov, to death, and immediately executed the sentence. This is a major victory for the Soviet Communist Party, the Soviet government, and the Soviet people in the struggle to crush imperialist anti-Soviet conspiracies and defend the Soviet socialist system. The Chinese people and all peace-loving people around the world fully support this resolute measure by the Soviet government, considering it a major victory for all peace-loving people, because the Soviet Union is the most powerful bastion for maintaining world peace and security.

    After the conspiracy of the traitorous Beria counter-revolutionary group was thoroughly exposed in June of this year, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union decided to remove Beria from his position as First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and Minister of Internal Affairs of the Soviet Union, and submitted the conspiracy case of this traitorous group to the court for trial. The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union approved this resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on August 8. The Supreme Procuratorate of the Soviet Union conducted a long and detailed investigation into the case of the traitor Beria. The Special Tribunal of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union conducted a secret trial from December 18 to 23. The results of the investigation and trial fully confirmed that Beria and his accomplices, such as Merkulov, were heartless traitorous criminals who betrayed the interests of the Soviet state and deserved to die.

    The results of the investigation and trial show that the criminal aim of the traitorous conspiracy group organized by the traitor Beria, using his position, was, for the benefit of imperialism, to use the institutions of the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs to oppose the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government. They maliciously attempted to place the Ministry of Internal Affairs above the Soviet Communist Party and the government in order to seize power, disintegrate the Soviet worker-peasant system, restore capitalism, and reinstate the rule of the bourgeoisie. As early as during the Soviet domestic revolutionary war, Beria committed treasonous acts, becoming an agent and spy of imperialism in the Soviet Union. As early as 1919, Beria was working as a special agent in the intelligence agency of the Musavat reactionary government in Baku, which directly carried out the instructions of the British intelligence agency. In 1920, Beria in Georgia again established secret contacts with the secret police of the Menshevik government, and this secret police of the Menshevik government also worked for the British intelligence agency. In subsequent years, Beria continued to maintain and expand his secret and sinister ties with these foreign intelligence agencies through spies of foreign intelligence agencies. In order to faithfully serve imperialism, and to carefully disguise and conceal his treasonous activities, Beria gathered a group of conspirators to form a traitorous group. They basely framed and persecuted those staff members who hindered their seizure of power and who were loyal to the cause of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government. The participants in this traitorous group were the conspirators, such as Merkulov, who had colluded with Beria for many years and were executed together this time.

    After the death of J.V. Stalin, the anti-Soviet activities of the imperialists became rampant. The traitor Beria also began to intensify his despicable and insidious activities. In order to seize power, he used his position to try his best to place the conspirators in his traitorous group in leading positions in the central and local institutions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and he did not hesitate to adopt despicable means of suppression, exclusion, and persecution against those honest staff members who refused to carry out his criminal plans. He conspired to obstruct the implementation of the measures of the Soviet Communist Party and the government on the development of agriculture, in order to undermine the Soviet worker-peasant alliance, undermine the collective farm system, and create difficulties in the domestic food supply in the Soviet Union. He also tried his best to instigate the remnants of bourgeois-nationalist elements in the various union republics to become rampant, and to create enmity and hatred among the various nationalities of the Soviet Union, in order to sow discord and division among the sincere friendship and unity of the various nationalities of the Soviet Union.

    Although the traitor Beria and his traitorous group carefully disguised and concealed their criminal conspiracy activities, they were exposed by the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government when they had just begun to intensify their traitorous activities. This shows that the Soviet Communist Party and the government are always vigilantly defending the interests of the Soviet people, and that all the Soviet people are closely united around the glorious Soviet Communist Party and the government; any insidious enemy who wants to undermine the Soviet system and undermine the interests of the Soviet people is bound to suffer a shameful defeat.

    The complete crushing of the counter-revolutionary conspiracy of the traitor Beria and his accomplices is an irresistible blow to imperialism. For many years, the imperialist reactionary forces have never given up their anti-Soviet activities. They have constantly clamored for the so-called "Cold War," and have tried every possible means to send spies and subversives into the Soviet Union, allocating hundreds of millions of dollars to engage in subversive activities. However, because the Soviet people are united and have long eliminated the exploiting classes, the imperialists' criminal activities in the Soviet Union have not been able to find any social basis. Therefore, the imperialist reactionary forces have used their intelligence agencies to collect shameless traitors like Beria as agents, hoping to use these traitors to achieve their destructive aims. The fact that the imperialist reactionary forces have revealed various undisguised feelings of disappointment and have made various panicked cries after the traitor Beria and his traitorous group were purged is enough to prove what a heavy blow this was to them.

    The entire working people of the Soviet Union have expressed their support with extreme satisfaction for the execution of the imperialist spy Beria and his accomplices. Enterprises, institutions, and collective farms throughout the Soviet Union held mass rallies on December 25, unanimously believing that the verdict of the Special Tribunal of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union expressed their wishes. This further demonstrates that the unity of the Soviet people and the friendship among the various nationalities of the Soviet Union are unbreakable, and shows that the Soviet state is further consolidated and its strength is further strengthened, and no reactionary force can stop the Soviet people from advancing towards communism.

    Now, the Soviet people are engaged in improving socialist agriculture and the production of daily necessities with a spirit of selfless labor, in order to strive to continuously improve their welfare. Under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party, the great Soviet people are moving from one victory to another, making the great Soviet Union forever a strong and invincible fortress for defending and consolidating world peace.

    The Chinese people express infinite indignation at the criminal acts of the traitor Beria and his traitorous group, and will draw valuable political lessons from the event of the Soviet people punishing the traitor Beria and his accomplices. The exposure and trial of the traitor Beria case has also greatly increased our political vigilance. Because the imperialist reactionary forces still surround us, we must not be the slightest bit negligent and relax our vigilance. On the contrary, the party and government organizations at all levels must strictly adhere to the collectivity and unity of the party's leadership, plug all the loopholes in our national work, so as to prevent any opportunity for the imperialist reactionary forces and their running dogs, so that in the struggle for the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism, we will closely advance together with the Soviet people.

    苏联人民粉碎贝利亚叛国集团的重大胜利
    苏联最高法院特别法庭根据俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国刑法，判处了革命叛徒和帝国主义间谍贝利亚及其同谋者麦尔库洛夫等罪犯以死刑，并立即执行了这个判决。这是苏联共产党、苏联政府和苏联人民在粉碎帝国主义反苏阴谋、保卫苏维埃社会主义制度的斗争中的一个重大的胜利。中国人民和全世界爱好和平人类完全支持苏联政府这一果断的措施，认为这是一切和平人类的重大胜利，因为苏联是维护世界和平与安全的最强大的堡垒。
    叛徒贝利亚反革命集团的阴谋在今年六月间被彻底揭露以后，苏联最高苏维埃主席团决定撤销贝利亚所担任的苏联部长会议第一副主席职务和苏联内务部部长职务，并将这个叛国集团的阴谋案件提交法院审理。苏联最高苏维埃于八月八日批准了苏联最高苏维埃主席团的这个决议。苏联最高检察署对叛徒贝利亚案件进行了长期和详尽的侦讯。苏联最高法院特别法庭在十二月十八日到二十三日进行了秘密审判。侦讯和审判的结果，完全证实了贝利亚及其同谋者麦尔库洛夫等是毫无心肝的、出卖苏维埃国家利益的、死有余辜的叛国罪犯。
    侦讯和审判的结果表明，叛徒贝利亚利用他的职位所组织的叛国阴谋集团的罪恶目的，是为了帝国主义的利益，利用苏联内务部的机构来反对苏联共产党和苏联政府，他们恶毒地企图把内务部放在苏联共产党和政府之上，以便夺取权力，瓦解苏联工农苏维埃制度，使资本主义复辟并恢复资产阶级的统治。还在苏联国内革命战争时期，贝利亚就犯了叛国罪行，成了帝国主义在苏联的代理人和间谍。远在一九一九年，贝利亚就在巴库的穆沙瓦特反动政府的情报机关中充当特务，这个情报机关是直接执行着英国情报机关的指示的。一九二○年，贝利亚在格鲁吉亚又和孟什维克政府的秘密警察建立了秘密联系，而这个孟什维克政府的秘密警察也是为英国情报机关工作的。在以后的年代中，贝利亚继续通过外国情报机关的间谍，维持并扩大他与这些外国情报机关的秘密的罪恶联系。为了忠实地为帝国主义服务，周密地伪装和掩饰自己的叛国活动，贝利亚纠集了一批阴谋分子组成叛国集团。他们曾卑鄙地诬告和陷害那些妨碍他们夺取权力的、忠实于苏联共产党和苏维埃政府的事业的工作人员。这个叛国集团的参加者，就是多年来和贝利亚狼狈为奸、这次一同被处决的麦尔库洛夫等阴谋分子。
    约·维·斯大林逝世后，帝国主义者的反苏活动猖獗起来了。叛徒贝利亚便也开始加紧了他的卑鄙和阴险的活动。他为了夺取权力，便利用自己的职位，竭力把他的叛国集团中的阴谋分子安插在内务部的中央和地方机构的领导职位上去，而对那些拒绝执行他的罪恶计划的正直工作人员，竟不惜采取压制、排挤和迫害的卑鄙手段。他阴谋阻挠苏联共产党和政府的关于发展农业的措施的执行，以破坏苏维埃工农联盟，破坏集体农庄制度，造成苏联国内粮食供应的困难。他又极力怂恿各加盟共和国的资产阶级——民族主义分子的残余猖獗起来，并在苏联各族人民之间制造敌意和仇恨，以挑拨离间苏联各族人民间的真诚的友谊和团结。
    叛徒贝利亚及其叛国集团，虽然周密地把他们的罪恶阴谋活动伪装和掩饰起来，但是在他们刚刚开始加紧进行叛国活动的时候，就被苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联政府揭露出来了。这说明苏联共产党和政府时刻警觉地捍卫着苏联人民的利益，全体苏联人民紧密地团结在光荣的苏联共产党和政府的周围；任何阴险的敌人要想破坏苏维埃制度，破坏苏联人民的利益，是必然要遭受可耻的失败的。
    叛徒贝利亚及其同谋者的反革命阴谋的被彻底粉碎，是对于帝国主义的一个无法抗拒的打击。帝国主义反动势力多年以来一直没有放弃过他们的反苏活动。他们不断鼓吹所谓“冷战”，千方百计地派遣间谍和颠覆分子到苏联境内，拨出数以亿计的美元来从事颠覆活动。但是，由于苏联人民的团结一致，早就消灭了剥削阶级，因此帝国主义的罪恶活动在苏联已经找不到任何社会基础，于是帝国主义反动势力就通过它的情报机关来搜罗像贝利亚这种无耻的叛徒来作为代理人，希图利用这些叛徒来达到它进行破坏的目的。叛徒贝利亚及其叛国集团被清洗后，帝国主义反动势力流露了各种不能掩饰的失望情绪，并发出各种惊慌的叫嚣，就足以证明这对于他们是何等沉重的打击了。
    对于帝国主义间谍贝利亚及其同谋者的处决，苏联全体劳动人民都以极为满意的心情表示拥护。苏联全国各地的企业、机关、集体农庄都在十二月二十五日举行了群众集会，一致认为苏联最高法院特别法庭的判决表达了他们的愿望。这就更加显示了苏联人民的团结和苏联各族人民间的友谊是牢不可破的，显示了苏维埃国家进一步的巩固和它的力量进一步的强大，没有任何反动势力能够阻挡得了苏联人民向共产主义前进的道路。
    现在，苏联人民正以忘我的劳动精神，从事于提高社会主义农业和日用品的生产，以争取不断地增进自己的福利。伟大的苏联人民在苏联共产党的领导下，正从一个胜利走向另一个胜利，使伟大的苏联永远成为保卫与巩固世界和平的强大而不可战胜的堡垒。
    中国人民对于叛徒贝利亚及其叛国集团的罪恶行为，表示无限地愤恨，并将从苏联人民制裁叛徒贝利亚及其同谋者的事件中，吸取宝贵的政治教训。叛徒贝利亚案件的揭发和审理，也大大地提高了我们的政治警惕性。由于帝国主义反动势力对我们的包围形势依然存在，我们就决不能丝毫麻痹大意，放松自己的警惕。相反的，我们党和政府的各级组织，必须严格地坚持党的领导的集体性和统一性，堵塞我们国家工作中的一切漏洞，以杜绝帝国主义反动势力及其走狗的任何可乘之隙，使我们在为和平民主和社会主义的事业而进行的斗争中，紧紧地和苏联人民一道向前迈进。
