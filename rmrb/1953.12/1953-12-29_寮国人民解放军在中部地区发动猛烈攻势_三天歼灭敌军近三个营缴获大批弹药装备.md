Xinhua News Agency, December 28th: According to Vietnam News Agency, the Lao Resistance Government issued a communique on December 27th stating: On December 22nd, the Lao People's Liberation Army launched a large-scale offensive against French army strongholds on Highway 12 in central Laos, which connects the Vietnam-Laos border and the Laos-Thailand border. After three days of fighting, the Lao People's Liberation Army completely annihilated the 2nd North African Battalion of the 4th Moroccan Regiment of the French army at the Na Pa stronghold near the Mu Gia Pass on the Vietnam-Laos border; and annihilated the 27th North African Battalion of the 2nd Mobile Group of the French army, another North African company, and two artillery companies in Yommalath. At the same time, the Lao People's Liberation Army also eliminated many French army outposts in the area. At present, a vast area from the Vietnam-Laos border to the vicinity of Thakhek on Highway 12 has been liberated.

The communique stated that in this three-day offensive, the Lao People's Liberation Army has inflicted casualties on the French army equivalent to nearly three battalions. All of these enemy's weapons and ammunition were captured by the Lao People's Liberation Army, including four 105mm cannons, 24 trucks, and a large amount of ammunition and equipment.

Xinhua News Agency, December 28th: According to Vietnam News Agency, December 27th: Military reporters from the Thakhek front reported on the large-scale offensive launched by the Lao People's Liberation Army against French army strongholds in Khammouane Province in central Laos:

Khammouane is a large province in central Laos, stretching from the Vietnam-Laos border to the Mekong River. On December 22nd, the Lao People's Liberation Army divided into two columns and launched a fierce offensive against the French army strongholds in the province. The first column of the Lao People's Liberation Army attacked the enemy stronghold in Yommalath, where the North African troops of the 2nd Mobile Group of the French army, recently transferred from the Red River Delta in northern Vietnam, were stationed. After three consecutive attacks, the Lao People's Liberation Army completely annihilated the 27th North African Battalion, a company of the 2nd North African Battalion of the 1st Moroccan Regiment, and two artillery companies of the enemy. The remaining enemy forces are fleeing in panic towards Thakhek, the capital of Khammouane Province.

The second column of the Lao People's Liberation Army attacked the 2nd North African Battalion of the 4th Moroccan Regiment of the French army stationed at Na Pa near the Mu Gia Pass. The enemy offered slight resistance and then fled south in panic. The Lao People's Liberation Army took advantage of the victory to pursue them fiercely for 30 kilometers, crossed the Xe Bang Fai River, and finally caught up with the fleeing enemy. The enemy then fled to the largest plain in Khammouane Province—the Mahaxay Plain. As a result of this pursuit and annihilation battle, the Lao People's Liberation Army completely annihilated the 2nd North African Battalion of the 4th Moroccan Regiment of the French army. Most of the enemy was captured. Now, the enemy strongholds in Yommalath, Mahaxay, Na Pa, and many other places have either been eliminated by the Lao People's Liberation Army or have been abandoned by the enemy. Highway 12 and the road leading to Mahaxay are littered with enemy corpses, vehicles, and weapons. The Lao People's Liberation Army is continuing to pursue the enemy fleeing towards Thakhek. Two-thirds of the main force of the enemy on the central Lao front, the 2nd Mobile Group, has been annihilated. The remaining enemy forces abandoned their vehicles and even heavy artillery and fled in panic towards Thakhek, and retreated to Savannakhet on December 25th.

Now, the enemy is sending reinforcements to the airport near Savannakhet in an attempt to salvage the defeat.

    寮国人民解放军在中部地区发动猛烈攻势
    三天歼灭敌军近三个营缴获大批弹药装备
    【新华社二十八日讯】据越南通讯社讯：寮国抗战政府在二十七日发表公报说：二十二日，寮国人民解放军对寮国中部连接越、寮边界和寮、泰边界的第十二号公路上的法军据点发动大规模的攻势。经过三天的战斗，寮国人民解放军全歼在越、寮边界穆嘉关附近那爆据点的法军第四摩洛哥团第二欧非营；并在容马勒歼灭法军第二机动团第二十七欧非营和另一欧非连以及两个炮兵连。同时，寮国人民解放军还拔除了该地区的许多法军前哨据点。现自越、寮边界至他曲附近的第十二号公路一带的广大地区已被解放。
    公报说，在这次历时才三天的攻势中，寮国人民解放军已使法军伤亡将近三个营；这些敌军的武器和弹药全部被寮国人民解放军缴获，其中有一百零五公厘大炮四门、卡车二十四辆和大量弹药、装备。
    【新华社二十八日讯】据越南通讯社二十七日讯：军事记者自他曲前线报道寮国人民解放军向寮国中部甘蒙省的法军据点所发动的大规模攻势的情形说：
    甘蒙是寮国中部的一个大省，从越、寮边境起到湄公河为止。十二月二十二日，寮国人民解放军分成两路纵队向该省的法军据点发动猛烈攻势。寮国人民解放军的第一路纵队向容马勒的敌军据点进攻，这里驻扎着新近从越南北部红河三角洲调来的法军第二机动团的欧非籍部队。在连续三次进攻后，寮国人民解放军全歼第二十七欧非营、第一摩洛哥团第二欧非营的一个连以及敌军的两个炮兵连。残敌正仓皇向甘蒙省省会他曲逃窜。
    寮国人民解放军的第二路纵队向驻在穆嘉关附近那爆的法军第四摩洛哥团第二欧非营进攻。敌军稍作抵抗即仓皇向南逃窜，寮国人民解放军乘胜猛追三十公里，渡过宾非河后终于追上了逃敌。敌军又向甘蒙省最大的平原——马哈晒平原逃窜。这次追歼战的结果，寮国人民解放军全歼法军第四摩洛哥团第二欧非营。敌军大部被俘。现在，容马勒、马哈晒、那爆和许多其他地方的敌军据点不是被寮国人民解放军拔除了，就是敌人被迫放弃了。第十二号公路和通向马哈晒的道路上满布着敌军丢下的尸体、车辆和武器。寮国人民解放军正继续追击向他曲逃窜的敌军。寮国中部战线上的敌军主要力量第二机动团的三分之二已被歼灭。残敌遗弃了车辆甚至重炮仓皇向他曲逃窜，并于十二月二十五日向沙湾拿吉撤退。
    现在，敌军正向沙湾拿吉附近的飞机场增派援军，企图挽救败局。
