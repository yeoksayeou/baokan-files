Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 20th: The Korean Central News Agency reported on the 17th that after hearing a report from Minister of Commerce Li Zhouyuan on the work of the government delegation sent to visit brotherly countries such as Poland, Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Bulgaria, the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea passed a relevant resolution on the 10th.

The Cabinet decision stated: From mid-July to late November 1953, the delegation of the Republic's government successively held talks with the governments of Poland, Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Bulgaria to discuss the issue of the aforementioned countries assisting our country in its post-war reconstruction of the people's economy. During our Fatherland Liberation War, the people and governments of all brotherly countries continuously sent many materials, and some even sent many medical personnel and fostered many war orphans. Today, after the armistice, the governments of friendly countries such as Poland, Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, and Czechoslovakia have not only decided to provide huge amounts of free aid to help us restore our war-damaged people's economy, but also decided to donate all the materials they provided us during the war to us free of charge. The Bulgarian government has also decided to provide our country with substantial free aid. The Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is extremely satisfied with the results of the talks between the Republic's government delegation and the governments of the various people's democratic countries and expresses its infinite gratitude for the assistance of the friendly countries.

The Cabinet decision emphasized: All the people of Korea will further strengthen the friendly unity with the people of the Soviet Union, China, and the various people's democratic countries in every way, which has become an important guarantee for all our victories.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 20th: Li Zhouyuan, head of the government delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, who recently returned from a visit to the people's democratic countries of Southeast Europe, gave a talk on the 19th.

Li Zhouyuan said: Our delegation was authorized to represent the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and was invited to visit Poland, Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Bulgaria, where we held talks with the governments of these countries. In order to help the Korean people quickly rebuild their war-damaged people's economy, the governments of these countries passed a series of decisions on providing Korea with economic and technical assistance. The governments of these countries and our government delegation signed agreements on providing Korea with free economic and technical assistance. According to these agreements, we will receive a large number of materials such as machinery, equipment, materials, and daily necessities needed for our reconstruction from these countries, and we will receive the economic and technical assistance needed to restore and build new factories and enterprises. Li Zhouyuan pointed out that this brotherly assistance, together with the assistance provided by the great Soviet Union and China, is of great help in promoting our country's recovery and construction.

Li Zhouyuan spoke about the great enthusiasm of the people of the people's democratic countries of Southeast Europe for aiding Korea. He said: When our delegation visited these countries, it was precisely the time when the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed. The people of these countries warmly congratulated our heroic Korean people on defeating the American aggressors and expressed their willingness to actively assist us in quickly rebuilding the war-damaged Korea. The workers and technicians of the various factories and enterprises we visited actively launched socialist production increase competitions and overfulfilled their production plans in order to send more aid materials to the Korean people. They also expressed their desire to participate in Korea's reconstruction work, just as they victoriously rebuilt their own countries liberated from the Hitler fascist invasion. The broad masses of the people of these countries constantly wrote letters to the Korean embassy expressing their determination to assist the Korean people in carrying out reconstruction.

Li Zhouyuan concluded by saying: The enthusiasm of the people of these brotherly countries in aiding our country will further encourage the Korean people's confidence in actively restoring and building the post-war people's economy.
