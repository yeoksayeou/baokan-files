Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 14th: According to TASS, the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic held a meeting on the 12th to discuss and approve the 1954 National Economic Plan.

    State Planning Committee Chairman Bruno Leuschner stated at the meeting that the main issues of the 1954 National Economic Plan are closely related to the issue of further improving the people's living standards. Leuschner said that according to the provisions of the 1954 economic plan, the production of consumer goods will be expanded by 23.5 percent compared to 1953. He then pointed out that a struggle must be launched to improve the quality of consumer goods and expand the variety of consumer goods. Leuschner said that due to the government's adoption of measures to improve the lives of working people, the purchasing power of residents of the German Democratic Republic has increased by 87 percent compared to 1950. Leuschner reported the figures stipulated in the plan for increasing industrial production, especially increasing electricity generation and coal production. He pointed out that the agricultural tasks outlined in the national economic plan must be subordinated to the policy of improving the material welfare of the working people.
    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 12th: According to TASS, Acting Prime Minister Walter Ulbricht of the German Democratic Republic spoke at the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic on the 10th.

    Ulbricht spoke about the great significance for the entire German working class of the decision on further improving the working conditions of workers and raising the living standards of workers, as well as on the rights of trade unions. Ulbricht pointed out that since the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, there have been three major increases in wages and salaries for factory workers and staff. The reduction in prices in August 1953 increased people's income by 560 million marks. Thanks to the assistance of the Soviet Union and the people's democracies, the German Democratic Republic has made great progress in developing production and improving the living standards of the working people. Ulbricht pointed out that the actual wage bill of the working people of the German Democratic Republic increased by 2.7 billion marks in 1953. The reduction in income tax in 1953 increased the income of factory workers and staff by another 450 million marks.

    Ulbricht said: It is necessary to rapidly develop heavy industry and heavy machinery manufacturing in order to create solid preconditions for improving the living standards of the working people and all the people of the German Democratic Republic. Without such achievements in heavy industry, it is impossible to implement the new policy. Ulbricht described in detail the achievements of the working people of the German Democratic Republic on the production front, and he called for increasing labor productivity and reducing production costs.
