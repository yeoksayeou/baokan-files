    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow: According to TASS Moscow, Moscow’s “Museum of Fine Arts” cinema began screening television programs on the 23rd. This is the first time in the Soviet Union that television programs have been watched collectively.
    The "Museum of Fine Arts" cinema has specially installed televisions and optical equipment for screening television programs. Special soundproof panels are cleverly installed on the walls and ceilings of the cinema. A powerful projector can project images four meters long and three meters high on the screen. When the television program began, the audience saw the familiar face of the Moscow Television Broadcasting Station reporter on the screen. Scenes of concerts by Soviet artists, sports programs, and theatrical performances appeared on the screen. The first television program broadcast by the Moscow Television Broadcasting Station for collective audiences was very successful.
    Television in the Soviet Union has achieved widespread development. Residents of Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, and nearby rural areas can watch programs broadcast by television stations in these cities every day. This year, the number of television sets produced by Soviet industry is two and a half times that of last year; next year it will increase to six times that of 1952. The manufacturing of television sets is gradually improving. Several new types of television sets have been successfully tested and are ready for mass production. Soviet scientists, designers, and engineers are working to expand the broadcast radius of television stations. When the broadcast radius is expanded, the scope of television stations' activities will also be greatly expanded. In recent years, ultra-shortwave broadcasting has greatly developed in the Soviet Union. Several new types of television sets are being used in conjunction with radios. For example, if people have a "North" brand television, they can watch television programs while listening to ultra-shortwave radio. In addition, Soviet experts are also successfully creating color television. In 1954-1955, the construction of television broadcasting stations will be expanded in several cities in the Soviet Union. By then, more people will be able to watch television programs.

    莫斯科“文物馆”电影院首次放映电视节目
      【新华社讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：莫斯科“文物馆”电影院从二十三日起开始放映电视节目。在苏联，集体观看电视节目这还是第一次。
    “文物馆”电影院为了放映电视节目，特别装置了电视机和光学设备。在电影院的墙壁和天花板上，巧妙地装设着特殊的隔音板。效力强大的放映机可以在银幕上放映出四公尺长、三公尺高的镜头。当电视节目开始时，观众在银幕上看到了莫斯科电视播送站报告员的熟悉的面孔。银幕上出现了苏联艺术家的音乐会、运动节目和戏剧演出的镜头。莫斯科电视播送站第一次播送的给集体观众欣赏的电视节目非常成功。
    苏联的电视事业已经获得了广泛的发展。莫斯科、列宁格勒、基辅以及附近乡村地区的居民，每天都可以观看这些城市中的电视播送站所播送的节目。今年，苏联工业所生产的电视机的数目为去年的二倍半；明年将增为一九五二年的六倍。电视机的制造正在逐渐完善。若干种新式电视机已试验成功并准备大量生产。苏联的科学家、设计师和工程师正在设法扩大电视播送站的作用半径。等到作用半径扩大后，电视播送站的活动范围也将大大扩大。最近几年来，超短波广播在苏联获得了很大的发展。若干种新式的电视机正在和收音机配合起来使用。例如，人们如果有“北方”牌电视机，就可以在观看电视节目的同时用超短波收音机收听。此外，苏联专家还在顺利地创造彩色电视。在一九五四—一九五五年中，苏联若干城市中还将扩大电视播送站的建设工作。到那时，将有更多的人能够观看电视节目。
