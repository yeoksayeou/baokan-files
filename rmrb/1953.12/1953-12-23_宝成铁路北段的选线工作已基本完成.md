    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, December 22nd: The route selection work for the northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway has been basically completed. The preliminary design for the Lueyang to Fengxian section will be submitted by the end of the year, and the preliminary design for the electrified section from Baoji to Fengxian will be submitted in April next year. Preparations are underway to concentrate tens of thousands of road-building troops in the spring of next year to begin key construction north of the Qinling Mountains. After the entire Baoji-Chengdu Railway is completed, it will become a major transportation artery between Southwest and Northwest China. Grain from the grain-producing areas of Sichuan and southern Shaanxi can be transported out in a steady stream, coal and iron ore deposits along the route will be developed, and timber from the famous Bailongjiang Forest Area can also be harvested in large quantities.
    The northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, after preliminary survey, is a total of 222 kilometers long. It starts from Baoji on the Longhai Railway line, crosses the Wei River to the southwest, crosses the Qinling Mountains, and reaches Lueyang on the Shaanxi border, where it connects with the southern section of the railway coming from Chengdu. Compared with the previously surveyed Tianshui-Lueyang section, this route not only has better geological conditions but also avoids the 153-kilometer Baoji-Tianshui section of the Longhai Railway, shortening the distance from the Southwest to North China.
    The northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway will be a very arduous project. The line will pass through many cliffs. About 35 percent of the roadbed along the entire line will have to be built in hard rock areas. Especially in the section from Baoji to the Qinling Mountains, the total length of the tunnels alone will account for more than 30 percent of the total length of this section, and one of the tunnels will become the longest tunnel in Guannei (inside the passes, i.e., Shaanxi). In the middle of this section, more than 20 deep gully bridges will also have to be built, with the highest bridges reaching more than 50 meters. In the middle, there is also a 26-kilometer-long section that, according to the suggestions of Soviet experts, will be designed as a 30‰ (permille) gradient, and electric locomotives will be used to pull trains through this section. Therefore, the arduousness of the entire project will be unprecedented in the history of railway construction in our country.
    Since the beginning of this year, the staff of the Seventh Survey and Design Team of the Design Bureau of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government have been climbing mountains and wading through rivers in the Qinling Mountains and along the Jialing River and Baishui River to carry out arduous survey work in order to select the most economical route. They successively selected three routes before finally deciding on the current one.

### 宝成铁路北段的选线工作已基本完成

    宝成铁路北段的选线工作已基本完成
    【新华社西安二十二日电】宝成铁路北段的选线工作已经基本完成，年底将提出略阳至凤县段的初步设计，明年四月提出宝鸡至凤县电气化地段的初步设计，并准备在明年春天集中几万人的修路大军，在秦岭以北开始重点施工。宝成铁路全线修通以后，将成为我国西南、西北间主要的交通干线。四川、陕南产粮区的粮食将可以源源外运，沿线煤铁矿藏将得到开发，著名的白龙江林区的木材也可以大量地采伐出来。
    经过初测以后的宝成铁路北段，共长二百二十二公里。它从陇海铁路线上的宝鸡起，向西南跨过渭河，越过秦岭，到陕西边境的略阳，和来自成都的南段铁轨相衔接。这条线路和过去选测的天（水）略（阳）段比较，不但地质情况较好，而且不必绕道陇海铁路一百五十三公里的宝（鸡）天（水）段，可以缩短西南到华北的距离。
    宝成铁路北段将是一段很艰巨的工程。线路将要在许多峭壁上通过。全线将有百分之三十五左右的路基要修筑在坚硬的岩石地带。特别是宝鸡到秦岭的一段中，光是隧道的总长度就将占这一段线路全长的百分之三十以上，其中有一座隧道将成为关内最长的隧道。在这一段中间还要架二十多座深沟桥，桥的高度最高的达五十余公尺。中间还有二十六公里长的一段，根据苏联专家建议，将要设计成为一段千分之三十的坡度，列车通过时将用电气机车来牵引。因此全段工程的艰巨程度，在我国铁路修筑史上将是空前的。
    中央人民政府铁道部设计局第七勘测设计总队的工作人员，为了选测这条最经济的线路，从今年年初开始就在秦岭山区和沿嘉陵江、白水河一带，攀山涉水，进行艰巨的勘测工作。他们曾先后选了三条线路，最后才加以选定。
