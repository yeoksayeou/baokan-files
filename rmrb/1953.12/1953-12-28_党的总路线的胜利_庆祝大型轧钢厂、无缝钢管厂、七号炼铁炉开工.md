    The Victory of the Party's General Line
    ——Celebrating the Launch of the Large Rolling Mill, Seamless Steel Tube Plant, and No. 7 Blast Furnace
    Han Tianshi, Secretary of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

    The three major construction projects of Anshan Iron and Steel – the Seamless Steel Tube Plant, the Large Rolling Mill, and the No. 7 Blast Furnace system – have been completed and put into production successively in October and December, after nine months to one year and three months of construction. These are among the first major projects in China's heavy industry construction to be completed and put into production. They will play a significant role in China's national economy and economic construction, producing a large number of various steel products and pig iron essential for industry, transportation, national defense construction, and agriculture. Its significance is major.

    These three major projects all apply the latest scientific achievements and have highly mechanized and automated equipment, with extremely strict technical requirements. Therefore, construction was very complex and difficult. However, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, many difficulties were overcome, and construction was finally completed. This shows that the Chinese working class and the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, can not only defeat domestic and foreign enemies to achieve the complete victory of the New Democratic Revolution, restore and develop production, but also build their own modern industry. Especially in the first year of implementing the Five-Year Economic Plan, significant results have been seen, and modern heavy industry factories with the latest equipment have been built. This major victory is not only a victory in itself, but it demonstrates the great victory of the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and the great victory of the Party's General Line.

    The decisive factor for the early completion and commissioning of the three major projects of Anshan Iron and Steel in the first year of the Five-Year Plan is the brilliance and foresight of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, as well as the regular and specific guidance and assistance of the higher-level Party and government. As early as before the complete liberation of Northeast China, the Northeast Bureau began planning the restoration of Anshan Iron and Steel. After the complete liberation of Northeast China, around the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee in 1949, the Party began planning the reconstruction of Anshan Iron and Steel, and began to negotiate with the Soviet government on the issue of reconstructing Anshan Iron and Steel, while also starting various preparations. In 1950, the Soviet government sent a large number of experts to Anshan to collect data and conduct design. Even during the most tense period of the Korean War, this preparatory work was still actively carried out. Before the large-scale construction began in the summer of 1951 and early 1952, the Anshan Municipal Committee and Anshan Iron and Steel Company, in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee, the Northeast Bureau, and the Northeast Industrial Department, shifted the focus of leadership from production to capital construction, and quickly gathered strength. 364 administrative management cadres and 229 technicians were transferred from production units. The higher-level Party and government also sent a large number of students, technicians, and cadres to strengthen the force of capital construction. Twelve business sections and six construction and installation engineering companies were established, and a political organization from top to bottom was established. At the same time, a large number of new workers and cadres were continuously trained and cultivated in the work. Vigorously gathering strength and establishing and strengthening various business organizations and specialized engineering companies is the organizational foundation for completing the capital construction tasks of Anshan Iron and Steel.

    The most fundamental and critical issue for the early completion and commissioning of the three major projects is the assistance of the Soviet Union and learning from the Soviet Union, learning from Soviet experts, and implementing Chairman Mao's instruction to "launch a high tide of learning from the Soviet Union throughout the country to build our country." The three major projects were all designed by the Soviet Union (the No. 7 Blast Furnace was partially designed by us), and the Soviet Union supplied complete sets of equipment and major equipment, and construction and installation were carried out under the personal guidance of Soviet experts. During the construction process, Soviet experts helped us establish scientific management organizations and systems, and trained a large number of technical and professional cadres for us. Recalling that before the construction of the three major projects, many comrades only began to work in industrial departments, and it can be said that they knew nothing about complex capital construction work. Even our engineering and technical personnel knew very little about constructing such projects. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, and after practical training during the construction process, they have now acquired preliminary knowledge, but this is still far from enough compared with the heavy and complex construction tasks in the future. Therefore, actively and enthusiastically learning from the Soviet Union and implementing expert recommendations is not only the main reason for past achievements, but also a powerful guarantee for future victories. All personnel should enthusiastically and comprehensively learn from Soviet experts, learning their science and technology, management experience, work methods, ideological style, as well as their great internationalist spirit and moral character. Learning from Soviet experts and promoting the learning experience should become a common task of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League, criticizing various ideological obstacles in learning from Soviet experts and implementing expert recommendations; establishing a certain organization to check and guide this work, assigning special personnel to be responsible, selecting personnel with good ideological qualities and a certain scientific level to be expert assistants; incorporating expert recommendations into the technical organization measures plan and personal plan of the unit; inviting experts to give lectures and publicizing the content of recommendations for learning; and establishing necessary registration (such as diaries, records, etc.) and inspection systems, timely checking, summarizing, and promoting, so that learning from the Soviet Union and implementing expert recommendations become an organized and widespread mass movement.

    The Party and Soviet experts have long pointed out that in all aspects of capital construction, special attention should be paid to strengthening survey and design work, because the speed and quality of capital construction first depend on resource exploration and design work. According to this instruction, the Municipal Committee and the Company gradually strengthened the leadership of survey and design work at the end of 1951, investing half of the technical personnel gathered in capital construction into the survey and design departments, and strengthening the leadership backbone, expanding the organization, and establishing professional institutions (Geology Department and Design Company) and a responsibility system (mainly the system of the general person in charge of the project). In geological exploration, technical management was strengthened, the core recovery rate was improved, core storage was strengthened, and the work of chemical analysis and geological summary was improved. A design planning work was established in the design department, so that the design can be carried out according to a certain plan, in order to gradually overcome the phenomenon of imbalance between design and construction. At the same time, more attention was paid to the ideological construction of designers. The quality, speed, and economy of design mainly depend on the ideological and political level and technical level of the designers, and many of the designers have been educated by the bourgeoisie and retain the influence of bourgeois technical and political thought. Therefore, ideological and political work among designers has a particularly important significance. Not only should they strengthen their learning in political movements, central work, political theory study, and social activities, but they must also follow the "special path" of ideological transformation of scientific and technical personnel indicated by Comrade Lenin, that is, to recognize communism through the actual achievements he has achieved in his own science, that is, to often carry out ideological education through learning advanced Soviet science and technology and summarizing the methods of technical work. Designers should be educated with a comprehensive perspective, an economic accounting perspective, a working-class perspective, and a pragmatic style.

    The design and equipment of the three major projects are the most advanced, highly mechanized and automated, which requires the full implementation of the Party's policy of good, fast, economical, and safe in construction to ensure full use of the superiority of design and equipment. This requires strict scientific management in construction. First of all, the administrative responsibility system should be established in accordance with the principles of the socialist enterprise production area management system and the individual responsibility system. At present, the most important thing is the basic-level administrative responsibility system (foreman responsibility system). Management organizations should be established according to this principle, unifying the professional teams and construction sections, and gradually unifying technical management and administrative management from the bottom up, while strengthening the work of professional and technical departments. A widespread mass movement should be carried out in the work of establishing the responsibility system, strengthening the ideological education and discipline education of employees, organizing the training of basic-level cadres, and establishing advanced figures and ideas to overcome the chaos and waste in the work, establishing a high sense of responsibility to the country, and opposing departmentalism, local viewpoints, and decentralism. Secondly, mobilize employees to discuss plans and carry out labor emulation campaigns, explain the important significance of Anshan Iron and Steel's capital construction, clarify the consistency of personal interests and national interests. In order to realize the monthly plan, a weekly and daily work plan should be gradually implemented, and the personnel who compile the plan should be organized to go deep into reality and closely contact the skilled workers, so that the work plan is in line with reality, and then mobilize discussion, formulate a guarantee plan, and carry out a patriotic labor emulation campaign. Third, strengthen technical management and improve project quality. First of all, the idea of "quality first for a century-long plan" should be established among employees, and various erroneous understandings that ignore quality should be criticized. Do a good job in technical clarification. Cadres and technical personnel should first study drawings and technical materials, and then explain to workers, launch discussions, and put forward guarantees. As a result, each unit has a consistent guarantee of quality classes, groups, and advanced figures (22 classes, 132 groups, 136 people), so that the quality of major projects is excellent and meets the design standards. At the same time, technical inspection and supervision should be strengthened. Fourth, to create conditions for further economic accounting, rationally use state funds, and eliminate waste, the engineering task list and engineering acceptance list (ie, the "No. 2" form) should be gradually promoted. At present, strengthening these four aspects of work in construction management will ensure the completion of engineering tasks with good quality, fast speed, savings, and safety.

    The nature of capital construction work is extremely complex, the technical requirements are strict, the tasks are heavy, the team is new, and most employees come from the urban and rural petty bourgeoisie, and they retain a strong sense of the small producer's sloppiness and economism, and are easily affected by the spontaneous forces of capitalism. In addition, the construction process is scattered, mobile, and seasonal, so ideological and political work in capital construction is particularly important. The first is to strengthen the education of the working class and the Communist Party and the national vision (General Line), the consistency of personal interests and national interests, continuously strengthen labor discipline, emphasize concentration and the concept of the whole, and oppose decentralism, departmentalism, and local viewpoints; advocate active initiative, and oppose waiting, dependence, and conservatism. Secondly, we must constantly strengthen our forces, train employees in a planned way, develop Party organizations, and conduct personnel reviews, and strengthen the Party's basic work and leadership over the trade union and the Communist Youth League. Regularly and continuously organize various training classes and spare-time learning in a planned way, especially to do a good job in winter training, in order to continuously improve the political, technical, and business levels of employees. For example, Anshan Iron and Steel's capital construction units had only more than 5,000 skilled workers in April 1952, and now it has increased to 37,234, and 275 people have been promoted from workers to technicians; in June 1952, there were 1,320 Party members, and by October this year, it had developed to 6,087 people. Third, maximize the enthusiasm and creativity of all employees, combine the labor creation of workers with the science and technology of technicians, encourage technicians to cooperate with workers; vigorously promote advanced experience, implement expert recommendations, timely commend and reward, and carry out regular and lasting patriotic labor emulation. Continuously carry out propaganda and mobilization work in the work, establish typical examples of advanced figures and advanced ideas, introduce and promote them, launch discussions and compare them, in order to promote the common progress of all employees. All workers, engineering and technical cadres, and management cadres who participated in the construction, under the encouragement and illumination of Chairman Mao and the Party's General Line, actively and proactively worked and studied day and night, overcame many difficulties, and completed the country's construction tasks with excellent project quality. They have tempered and improved themselves in hard work, and many advanced workers and models have emerged (102 labor models and 690 advanced workers). This is another important harvest brought about by the completion of the three major projects.

    The successful completion of the three major projects is only a good start to the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel, and only a small part of the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel. Compared with the projects to be built for national industrialization, it is even smaller. Heavy and arduous construction tasks are still behind. In future work, we must further strengthen the study of the Party's General Line; better learn from the Soviet Union and implement expert recommendations; strengthen survey and design and equipment supply work; thoroughly promote the basic-level responsibility system; continue to improve project quality; overcome waste and gradually establish an economic accounting system. In particular, it is necessary to strengthen the Party's political and ideological work and basic-level work, cultivate and train talents in the work, continue to strengthen the construction force, and prepare for the completion of larger engineering tasks in the future and for the second and third steel bases.

    All parts of the country, under the illumination of the Party's General Line, actively and enthusiastically supported the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel, creating favorable conditions for the completion of the three major projects and the start of production. Therefore, the early completion and commissioning of the three major projects is a common victory of the people of the whole country and a victory of the Party's General Line.

    党的总路线的胜利
    ——庆祝大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂、七号炼铁炉开工
    中共鞍山市委书记　韩天石
    鞍山基本建设的三大工程——无缝钢管厂、大型轧钢厂和七号炼铁炉系统工程，历时九个月至一年三个月的时间，已于十月份和十二月份内相继竣工并投入生产了。这是我国重工业建设中首先竣工投入生产的一批重要工程。它们对我国国民经济和经济建设将发挥重大作用，将为国家生产出大批工业、运输业、国防建设以及农业所不可缺少的各种钢材和生铁，其意义是重大的。
    这三大工程都是应用最新的科学成果，有着高度机械化、自动化设备的工厂，技术要求极为严格，因此，在建设中是很复杂和困难的。但是在党中央的正确领导下，在苏联的无私帮助下，克服了许多困难，而终于建成了。这说明在中国共产党领导下的中国工人阶级和全国人民不仅能战胜国内外的敌人取得新民主主义革命的彻底胜利，恢复和发展生产，而且能够建设自己的现代化的工业，特别是在实行五年经济计划的第一年即看到了显著的成效，建成了有最新设备的现代化的重工业工厂。这一重大的胜利，不仅是这个事件本身的胜利，它表明了党中央和毛主席正确领导的伟大胜利，党的总路线的伟大胜利。
    鞍钢三大工程能够在五年计划开始第一年中提前竣工和投入生产，其决定的因素就是党中央和毛主席领导的英明和远见，以及上级党和政府经常地具体地指导和帮助。早在东北全部解放之前，东北局即着手筹划鞍钢的恢复工作，及至全东北解放后，一九四九年二中全会前后，党即开始筹划鞍钢的重建工作，并开始与苏联政府协商重建鞍钢问题，同时着手进行各项准备。一九五○年苏联政府派了大批专家到鞍山收集资料和进行设计，就是在朝鲜战争最紧张的时候，这种准备工作仍在积极进行。一九五一年夏季一九五二年初，大规模的施工开始前，鞍山市委和鞍山钢铁公司为了迎接艰巨的建设任务，遵照党中央、东北局和东北工业部的指示，把领导重心从生产工作转到基本建设，并迅速地集结了力量，从生产单位调出行政管理干部三六四名，技术人员二二九名，上级党和政府又派来了大批学生、技术人员和干部，加强了基本建设的力量，建立了十二个业务处和六个建筑和安装工程公司，建立了从上到下的政治机构，同时在工作中陆续不断地培养和训练了大批新的工人和干部。大力集结力量，建立和加强各种业务机构和专业工程公司，这是完成鞍钢基本建设任务的组织基础。
    三大工程的提前竣工和投入生产最根本和最关键的问题就是苏联的援助和向苏联学习、向苏联专家学习，就是贯彻毛主席“要在全国范围内掀起学习苏联的高潮，来建设我们的国家”的指示。三大工程都是由苏联设计（七号炼铁炉是由我们作部分设计）由苏联供应全套设备和主要设备，并在苏联专家亲自指导下建筑和安装的，在建设过程中，苏联专家帮助我们建立了科学的管理机构和制度，为我们培养了大批技术和专业干部。回想在三大工程施工以前，许多同志才开始到工业部门工作，对复杂的基本建设工作可以说是一无所知，就是我们的工程技术人员对建设这样工程也是知道得很少的，在苏联专家的指导下，经过建设过程中的实际锻炼，现在已经获得了初步知识，但这与今后繁重复杂的建设任务相比仍然是十分不够的。因此，积极地热心地学习苏联和贯彻专家建议不仅是过去获得成绩的主要原因，而且是今后取得胜利的有力保证，全体人员均应热心地全面地向苏联专家学习，学习他们的科学技术、管理经验、工作方法、思想作风，以及他们伟大的国际主义精神和道德品质。向苏联专家学习和推广学习经验应成为党、行政、工会、青年团的共同任务，批判向苏联专家学习和贯彻专家建议中的各种思想障碍；建立一定组织检查和指导这一工作，指派专人负责，选派思想品质优良而又具有一定科学水平的人员为专家助手；把专家建议订入该单位技术组织措施计划和个人计划之内；邀请专家讲课和公布建议内容，进行学习；同时建立必要的登记（如日记手册、记录等）和检查制度，及时检查总结和推广，使学习苏联和贯彻专家建议，成为有组织的广泛的群众运动。
    党和苏联专家早就指出：基本建设的各个环节中，应特别注意加强勘察设计工作，因为基本建设的速度和质量，首先取决于资源勘察和设计工作。市委和公司根据这一指示，一九五一年末即逐步地加强了对勘察设计工作的领导，将集结到基本建设的技术人员的一半投入到勘察设计部门，并充实了领导骨干，扩大了组织，建立了专业机构（地质处和设计公司）及责任制度（主要是工程总负责人的制度）。在地质勘察中加强了技术管理，提高了岩心采取率和加强了岩心保管，改善了化验、分析和地质总结工作。在设计部门建立了设计计划工作，使设计能按照一定计划进行，以逐步克服设计与施工不平衡的现象。同时更重视了设计人员的思想建设工作，设计的质量、速度和节约主要是取决于设计人员的思想政治水平和技术水平，而设计人员中有很多受过资产阶级教育，残留着资产阶级技术思想和政治思想的影响。因此设计人员中的政治思想工作，就有着特别重要意义。不仅在政治运动、中心工作、政治理论学习和社会活动中加强其学习，而且要遵循列宁同志所指示的科学技术人员思想改造的“特殊途径”，即经过他在自己那一门科学方面所达到的实际成就来认识共产主义，也就是要经常的以学习苏联的先进科学技术和总结技术工作的方法来进行思想教育工作。要以全面观点、经济核算观点、工人阶级观点和实事求是的作风来教育设计人员。
    三大工程的设计和设备都是最先进的，是高度机械化和自动化的，这就需要在施工中全面地贯彻党的好、快、省安全方针，以保证充分利用设计和设备的优越性，这就需要在施工中有严密的科学的管理工作，首先就是要按照社会主义企业的生产区域管理制和个人负责制的原则来建立行政责任制，目前特别重要的是基层行政责任制（工长责任制），按照这个原则来建立管理机构，把专业队和施工的工段统一起来，逐渐地、从下而上地把技术管理与行政管理统一起来，同时加强专业和技术部门的工作。建立责任制工作中应开展广泛的群众性运动，加强职工思想教育，纪律教育，组织基层干部训练，树立先进人物和思想，以克服工作中的混乱和浪费现象，树立对国家的高度的责任心，反对本位主义、局部观点和分散主义。其次，发动职工讨论计划，开展劳动竞赛运动，说明鞍钢基本建设的重要意义，明确个人利益与国家利益的一致性，为实现每月计划，应逐步实行逐周分日作业计划，组织编制计划人员深入实际密切与技术工人的联系，务使作业计划切合实际，然后发动讨论，订出保证计划，开展爱国主义劳动竞赛。第三、加强技术管理，提高工程质量，首先，在职工中要树立“百年大计，质量第一”的思想，批判忽视质量的各种错误认识。做好技术交底，干部和技术人员首先进行学习图纸和技术资料，然后向工人交代，展开讨论，提出保证。由此，各单位均出现了一贯保证质量的班、组和先进人物（二十二个班，一三二个小组，一三六人）使主要工程质量皆为优等，达到了设计标准。同时应加强技术检查和监督工作。第四，为进一步进行经济核算创造条件，合理利用国家资金、消除浪费，应逐步地推行工程任务单和工程验收单（即
  “二号”表）。目前在施工管理中加强这四方面的工作，保证以好的质量、快的速度、节省和安全地完成工程任务。
    基本建设工作的性质极为复杂，技术要求严格，任务重，队伍新，职工多来自城乡小资产阶级，浓厚地保存着小生产者的散漫性和经济主义观点，易于感受资本主义自发势力的影响，加之施工过程的分散、流动和带有季节性，因而基本建设中的政治思想工作就显得特别重要。首先是加强工人阶级与共产党及国家远景（总路线）、个人利益与国家利益一致性的教育，不断地加强劳动纪律，强调集中和整体观念，反对分散主义、本位主义和局部观点；提倡积极主动，反对等待依赖和保守思想。其次要不断壮大力量，有计划地培训职工，发展党的组织及进行人事审查工作，加强党的基层工作和对工会青年团的领导。经常不断地有计划地组织各种训练班和业余学习，特别是要做好冬季训练，以不断地提高职工的政治、技术和业务水平。如鞍钢基建单位一九五二年四月仅有技术工人五千多人，现在已增为三七、二三四人，并由工人提为技术员者二七五人；一九五二年六月党员一三二○人，至今年十月已发展到六○八七人。第三，最大的发挥全体职工的积极性和创造性，把工人的劳动创造与技术人员的科学技术结合起来，鼓励技术人员与工人合作；大力推广先进经验、贯彻专家建议，及时表扬和奖励，开展经常的持久的爱国劳动竞赛。在工作中不间断地进行宣传鼓动工作，树立先进人物先进思想的典型，加以介绍推广，展开讨论进行对照，以推动全体职工共同前进。参加建设的全体工人、工程技术干部和管理干部在毛主席和党的总路线的鼓舞和照耀下，积极地、主动地日以继夜地工作和学习，克服了很多困难，以优良的工程质量完成了国家的建设任务，在艰苦的工作中锻炼和提高了自己，出现很多先进工作者和模范（劳动模范一○二名、先进工作者六九○名），这是完成三大工程所带来的另外的重要收获。
    三大工程的胜利竣工仅是鞍钢建设的良好开端，仅是鞍钢建设中的一小部分，比之国家工业化所要建设的工程就更加小了。繁重而艰巨的建设任务还在后面，在今后工作中要进一步加强党的总路线的学习；更好地向苏联学习和贯彻专家建议；加强勘察设计以及设备供应工作；要深入地推行基层责任制；继续提高工程质量；克服浪费现象，逐步建立经济核算制。特别要加强党的政治思想工作和基层工作，在工作中培养和训练人材，继续壮大建设力量，为完成今后更大的工程任务，为第二和第三个钢铁基地作准备。
    全国各地在党的总路线照耀下，积极地热烈地支援鞍钢建设，为完成三大工程任务和开工生产创造了有利条件，因此，三大工程提前竣工投入生产是全国人民共同的胜利，是党的总路线的胜利。
