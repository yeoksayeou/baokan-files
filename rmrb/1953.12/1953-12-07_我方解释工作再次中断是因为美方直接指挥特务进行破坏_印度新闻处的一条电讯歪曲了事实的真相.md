Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 4th: A special correspondent for this agency reports: It has been eighteen days since the fifth interruption of the explanation work by the Korean and Chinese side. The evidence of the US side directing special agents to control and threaten prisoners of war and sabotage the explanation work is increasing daily. Under the rampant sabotage activities of the US side, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces have failed to take resolute action in accordance with their "Terms of Reference" and "Working Procedures" to fulfill their responsibilities, leaving the stalemate in the explanation work created single-handedly by the US side unresolved. People are already very familiar with the truth about the suspension of explanations and the various crimes of the US special agents, as well as the major conspiracy of detaining prisoners of war that runs through them. There is no doubt as to where the responsibility for sabotaging the explanation work lies.

However, a dispatch from New Delhi by the Indian News Agency on the 2nd stated: "It is said that the explanation work was again suspended on November 17th because the Korean People's Army Command and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Command insisted that North Korean prisoners of war who had not been interviewed should be handed over before they explained to the Chinese prisoners of war. It is said that this request is contrary to the rules of the explanation work, which stipulate that notice should be given twenty-four hours before the explanation work is carried out." This statement by the Indian News Agency regarding the suspension of the explanation work has nothing in common with the universally known facts.

The Korean and Chinese side has repeatedly pointed out that the re-suspension of the explanation work on November 17th was a direct result of obstruction and sabotage by the US side and the special agents under its command. On November 16th, the Korean and Chinese side conducted explanations to Korean People's Army prisoners of war in Camp No. 53 in Dongchang-ri according to the pre-arranged plan. Because the US special agents' control over the prisoners of war had not been lifted, the special agents and the prisoners of war they held instigated riots in the explanation tent, and the US personnel in the explanation tent repeatedly obstructed and interrupted the explanation work, delaying a lot of time, so that only a small part of the prisoners of war heard the explanation that day. According to Article 20 of the "Working Procedures"—"Prisoners of war applying for repatriation who have been explained according to Article 7 of these Working Procedures but have not yet applied for repatriation, and prisoners of war who have not been explained and have not applied for repatriation, shall be kept separately."-- On that day, when the explanation representative of the Korean and Chinese side found that the original explanation plan was difficult to complete, they twice pointed out to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission that the prisoners of war who had not been explained should be separated from the prisoners of war who had been explained but had not yet applied for repatriation, and after the explanation work was completed that day, the Korean and Chinese side made this request to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for the third time, in order to continue to explain to the prisoners of war in Camp No. 53 who had not been explained. As early as November 6th, the Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission had clearly stated to the Korean and Chinese side that he was prepared to build another camp to isolate those prisoners of war who had been explained and those who had not been explained, as long as the Korean and Chinese side agreed not to start explaining to the new camp before completing the explanation of all the prisoners of war in one camp. The Korean and Chinese side agreed to this suggestion at that time, and in fact demanded to continue to explain to the prisoners of war in Camp No. 53 who had not heard the explanation according to the above-mentioned conditions put forward by General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, on November 6th. However, on November 16th, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces did not, in accordance with the provisions of the "Working Procedures" and the promise of the Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, separate and guard the prisoners of war who had not been explained and who had been explained in Camp No. 53. Under the circumstances that the US special agents claimed that they would not allow the separation of prisoners of war who had heard and had not heard the explanation, so as not to disrupt their strict organization, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces went back on their word and stated that they could not make isolation arrangements in accordance with the legitimate explanation plan of the Korean and Chinese side. In this way, the explanation work of the Korean and Chinese side could not continue, and the explanation work was suspended.

The report of the Indian News Agency obviously failed to give a correct and factual explanation of the fundamental and direct reasons for the suspension of the explanation work. The fact is that in its statement issued on October 2nd, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission had already pointed out that the US special agent organization in the Dongchang-ri prisoner-of-war camp used violence to control and threaten the prisoners of war, making it impossible for them to express their desire for repatriation. The recent secret instructions from the US, Li, and Chiang sides to the special agents in the prisoner-of-war camp published by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission further proved the US side's conspiracy to directly direct special agents to sabotage the explanation work, kill prisoners of war who demanded to return home, and forcibly detain prisoners of war. The above-mentioned report of the Indian News Agency contradicts this understanding of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and this report, which contradicts the facts, is of no benefit to reversing the serious situation in which the current "Terms of Reference" have been deliberately undermined.

### 我方解释工作再次中断是因为美方直接指挥特务进行破坏  印度新闻处的一条电讯歪曲了事实的真相

    我方解释工作再次中断是因为美方直接指挥特务进行破坏
    印度新闻处的一条电讯歪曲了事实的真相
    【新华社开城四日电】本社特派记者报道：朝中方面的解释工作第五次中断以来已达十八天之久。美方指挥特务控制和威胁战俘、破坏解释工作的罪证与日俱增，而中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队在美方的猖狂破坏活动下未能按照“职权范围”与“工作细则”采取坚决行动以履行其职责，使美方一手造成的解释工作的僵局至今未能打破。人们对于解释停顿的真相和美方特务形形色色的罪行与贯穿其中的扣留战俘的重大阴谋，早已十分熟悉。破坏解释工作的责任何在，已经无可置疑。
    但是，印度新闻处二日发自新德里的一条电讯却说：“据说解释工作在十一月十七日又陷于停顿，是因为朝鲜人民军司令部和中国人民志愿军司令部坚持在他们对中国战俘进行解释以前，首先应把未听取解释的北朝鲜战俘交出来。据说，这个要求是违背解释工作细则的，解释工作细则规定在进行解释工作以前二十四小时提出通知。”印度新闻处关于解释工作停顿的这种说法，是和举世周知的事实毫无共同之处的。
    朝中方面一再指明：十一月十七日解释工作再次停顿，是美方及其指挥下的特务进行阻挠和破坏的直接结果。十一月十六日，朝中方面按照预先提出的计划向东场里第五十三号营场的朝鲜人民军战俘进行解释，由于美方特务对战俘的控制未被解除，特务及其挟持下的战俘在解释帐篷内吵闹行凶，而解释帐篷中的美方人员又一再阻挠和中断解释工作，耽搁了很多时间，以致当天解释工作未能按照预定计划与速度进行，结果只有少数一部分战俘听到解释。根据“工作细则”第二十款——“申请遣返之战俘，按照本工作细则第七款经过解释但尚未提出申请遣返之战俘，以及尚未经解释又未提出申请遣返之战俘，应予分别看管。”——的规定，当天朝中方面解释代表发现原定解释计划难于完成时，即两次向中立国遣返委员会指出，应将未经解释的战俘与经过解释尚未申请遣返的战俘予以隔离看管，当天解释工作完毕后，朝中方面第三次向中立国遣返委员会提出这一要求，以便向五十三号营场中尚未经过解释的战俘继续进行解释。而中立国遣返委员会主席早在十一月六日已向朝中方面明确表示，准备修建另一营场，以隔离那些已经解释和未经解释的战俘，只要朝中方面同意在完成一个营场的全部战俘的解释前，不开始对新的营场进行解释。朝中方面当时同意了这一建议，而且事实上是按照中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军十一月六日提出的上述条件来要求继续对第五十三号营场未听解释的战俘进行解释的。但是，中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队在十一月十六日却并未按照“工作细则”的规定和中立国遣返委员会主席的诺言，对五十三号营场未经解释和已听解释的战俘加以隔离看管。在美方特务声称不允许隔离已听和未听解释的战俘，以免打乱其严密组织的情况下，中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队自食其言，表示无法按照朝中方面合法的解释计划进行隔离安排。这样，朝中方面的解释工作才不能继续进行，解释工作才陷于停顿。
    印度新闻处的报道对于解释工作陷于停顿的根本的和直接的原因，显然未能给以正确的和符合事实的说明。事实是，中立国遣返委员会在其十月二日发表的声明中，早已指出东场里战俘营中的美方特务组织以暴力控制和威胁战俘，使战俘无法表达其遣返的愿望。最近中立国遣返委员会发表的美李蒋方面给战俘营中特务的秘密指令，更进一步证明美方直接指挥特务分子有计划地破坏解释工作、杀害要求回国的战俘和强迫扣留战俘的阴谋活动。印度新闻处的上述报道与中立国遣返委员会的这种认识，互相矛盾，而这种与事实矛盾的报道，对于扭转当前“职权范围”遭到蓄意破坏的严重局面，是毫无裨益的。
