To the Esteemed Editor: In order to study ancient artistic heritage, we organized an ancient sculpture investigation team to visit ancient sculptures in Yungang in Datong, Tianlong Mountain in Taiyuan, Longmen in Luoyang, and other places. The Tianlong Mountain stone carvings, which have always been regarded as typical of the Tang Dynasty, have been completely stolen and destroyed by imperialism, which is truly hateful. In the world-renowned Longmen Grottoes in Luoyang, tens of thousands of Buddha heads and statues have also been mostly knocked off and stolen. It is said that the Longmen Stone Buddhas in Luoyang were stolen and destroyed during the reactionary rule era, and Yue Bin, an antique dealer from Tan'er Hutong, Liulichang, Beijing, stole the most. Yue Bin colluded with imperialism to steal in a planned and large-scale manner. He stole 18 large Buddha statues and countless small Buddhas in one instance. "Empress Worshipping Buddha," one of the most outstanding works of Longmen statues, was stolen by him that time and sold to American imperialists. The most precious artistic heritage of our motherland throughout the dynasties has been devastated by him, causing irreparable losses. This kind of unscrupulous behavior of stealing and selling national cultural relics is no different from being an enemy of the people. Therefore, we hereby file a report and demand that such a traitorous merchant as Yue Bin be severely punished.

    雕刻工作者刘开渠等十人来信
    揭发奸商岳彬盗卖龙门石佛的严重罪行
    编辑同志：我们为了研究古代美术遗产，组织了古代雕刻考查团，到大同云岗、太原天龙山、洛阳龙门等处，参观了古代雕刻。一向被人认为是唐代石刻典型的天龙山石刻，已被帝国主义盗窃破坏一空，真是令人痛恨。世界闻名的洛阳龙门的石窟中，数以万计之佛头佛像也大部被敲下盗走。据说洛阳龙门石佛在反动统治时代遭到了盗卖和破坏，就中以北京琉璃厂炭儿胡同古董商人岳彬盗窃最多。岳彬勾结帝国主义有计划地、大规模地盗窃，他一次就盗走大型佛像十八尊，小佛无数，龙门造像中最优秀的作品之一“王后礼佛图”就在那一次被他盗走，卖给美帝国主义者。我们祖国历代最可珍贵的美术遗产，竟被他破坏得惨不忍睹，造成无法补偿的损失。此种盗卖国家文物丧尽天良的行为，无异人民公敌。为此，我们特提出检举，对岳彬这样的奸商，必须严加惩处。
