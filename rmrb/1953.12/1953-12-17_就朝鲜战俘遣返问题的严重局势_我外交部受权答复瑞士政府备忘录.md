Xinhua News Agency, December 16th: On November 25, 1953, the Political Department (i.e., the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) of the Swiss Federal Government presented a Swiss Federal Government memorandum to the governments of the People's Republic of Poland and the Czechoslovak Republic regarding the issue of prisoner of war repatriation in Korea. A similar memorandum was also communicated to Feng Xuan, the Chargé d'Affaires of the People's Republic of China in Bern.

On December 16, 1953, Zhang Hanfu, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, met with René Zoelly, the Swiss Minister to China in Beijing, and presented him with a memorandum from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China in response to the aforementioned Swiss Federal Government memorandum.

This memorandum from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has been communicated to the governments of the Republic of India, the People's Republic of Poland, the Czechoslovak Republic, and the Kingdom of Sweden.

The following are the full texts of the December 16, 1953 memorandum from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the November 25, 1953 memorandum from the Swiss Federal Government.

Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China's Reply to the Swiss Federal Government's Memorandum

The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has received the Swiss Federal Government's memorandum of November 25, 1953, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government is now authorized to make the following reply:

I. Since the Swiss delegation was appointed by the Swiss government to participate in the work and activities of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in Korea, the Swiss government naturally bears responsibility for its delegation. Since the Swiss Federal Council has made a decision and publicly declared its full approval of the position taken by the Swiss delegation in the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the Swiss government naturally has no reason not to discuss the issue of prisoner of war repatriation with the governments concerned. Moreover, in fact, the Swiss government has expressed its views on the issue of prisoner of war repatriation to three relevant countries—Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the People's Republic of China—in its memorandum.

II. In its memorandum, the Swiss government, on the one hand, expressed its hope "to enable each prisoner of war to freely and without any threat of violence decide whether he is prepared to exercise his right of repatriation," but on the other hand, opposed the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission exercising its legitimate powers to eliminate those special agents who use violence to threaten prisoners of war and prevent them from listening to explanations and requesting repatriation, and described this issue as the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission "using force to compel prisoners of war to attend explanation meetings." This is a distortion of right and wrong and is self-contradictory. It should be stated that, in order to ensure that each prisoner of war can freely exercise his right of repatriation in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission must fully utilize the legitimate powers conferred upon it by paragraph 7 of the "Terms of Reference," including the power to use coercive measures, to eliminate those special agents controlling the prisoner of war camps, thereby fundamentally eliminating the severe threat of violence to which the prisoners of war are subjected. Conversely, if the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's right to use coercive measures is opposed, it is an intentional attempt to weaken the legitimate powers of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, an intentional attempt to protect the special agents' threat of violence and reign of terror over the prisoners of war, and the result will inevitably be that the prisoners of war will not have the opportunity to freely exercise their right of repatriation.

III. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has admitted more than once in its official documents that, in the prisoner of war camps guarded by Indian troops, the captured personnel of the Korean and Chinese side are actually controlled by the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek special agents under the command of the United States, and have absolutely no freedom to express their desire for repatriation; prisoners of war who request repatriation have to risk their lives to escape from the prisoner of war camps. The Swiss Commissioner participated in the drafting and publication of these documents. Recently, the Swiss Commissioner also personally saw the intercepted secret order from the Rhee gang's special agent Park Dong-hyuk to the Rhee and Chiang special agents mixed in the prisoner of war camps, instructing the special agents on how to refuse and sabotage the explanation work, how to organize the sabotage activities of the Rhee and Chiang special agents, how to control and kill prisoners of war who wish to be repatriated, how to strengthen the special agent organizations in the prisoner of war camps and their connections with the special agent headquarters in Seoul, and even appointing special agent leaders to official positions. This document and many similar documents intercepted in the past prove that the American, Rhee, and Chiang special agents mixed in the prisoner of war camps are sent by the US military headquarters to carry out a reign of terror and sabotage the explanation work in order to achieve the US side's sinister goal of forcibly detaining prisoners of war. Under such rampant violent control by special agents, if the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission does not promptly exercise its legitimate powers and resolutely take effective measures to carry out isolation arrangements and eliminate those special agents and break up the special agent terror organizations, how can the explanation work be carried out? How can the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" be implemented?

IV. The Swiss Federal Government's memorandum states: "The Federal Council very much hopes that a practical solution can be found within the scope of the 'Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission' of June 8, 1953, so that each prisoner of war can freely and without any threat of violence decide whether he is prepared to exercise his right of repatriation." Are there "practical solutions" within the "Terms of Reference" that can eliminate the control of special agents? The answer is definitely yes. The Swiss government was obviously aware of paragraphs 1, 3, 4, 7, and 8 of the "Terms of Reference" before sending its delegation to participate in the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The Swiss representative participated in the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work" formulated by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in accordance with the "Terms of Reference." On September 20, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission unanimously passed a resolution, "requesting the Chairman of the Commission, as the executor, to instruct the commander of the Indian custodian forces to take all possible measures to prevent or suppress acts of violence committed by prisoners of war and to punish those who have committed such crimes." On October 16, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission unanimously passed another resolution stipulating that the Indian custodian forces may use weapons in the event of attacks and attempts by prisoners of war to escape collectively. The Swiss representative, like other representatives participating in the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, approved these resolutions. However, now, some members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, disregarding these regulations and resolutions, oppose the use of coercive measures against special agents who threaten prisoners of war with violence, oppose eliminating special agents, and oppose the Indian troops being responsible for isolating those prisoners of war who have been explained and those who have not been explained. As a result, the above regulations and resolutions cannot be implemented at all, and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission is paralyzed as a result.

V. The Geneva Conventions should be observed, and humanitarian principles should be defended. However, the situation in the Dongchang-ri prisoner of war camp under the control of the American, Rhee, and Chiang special agents completely violates the humanitarian principles of the Geneva Conventions. The inhuman torture and killings perpetrated by special agents against prisoners of war in the prisoner of war camps, such as tattooing, cutting flesh, gouging out hearts, and disembowelment, are a direct violation of Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions regarding the prohibition of violence and murder against prisoners of war. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, due to the opposition of some members to the use of coercive measures to sanction such atrocities, has adopted an attitude of "inaction," which, according to Article 13 of the Geneva Conventions, constitutes a serious violation of the Conventions. On this major issue, any government that truly upholds the Geneva Conventions and humanitarian principles cannot but pay serious attention.

VI. When the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission began its work, it published the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work," "Announcement to All Prisoners of War," and "Statement on the Progress of Work" in accordance with the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission." These documents are basically correct. The attitudes of the commissioners from various countries on the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in handling the above issues were generally fair. However, under the interference and pressure of the United States government, some members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission gradually failed to uphold this position. Taking the central issue of explanation work as an example, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission requested the Korean and Chinese side to add isolation facilities in the prisoner of war camps of the United Nations forces. The Korean and Chinese side immediately complied, and the United Nations forces have already conducted isolation explanations for their captured personnel. However, when the Korean and Chinese side proposed on November 17 that isolation facilities should also be added in the prisoner of war camps of the Korean and Chinese captured personnel in order to carry out isolation explanations, the American, Rhee, and Chiang special agents, fearing that such isolation explanations would undermine their special agent rule, did not allow the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to carry out isolation arrangements in accordance with Article 18 of the "Terms of Reference" and Article 20 of the "Detailed Rules." Under the pressure of the US side, some members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission openly violated the regulations and promises they had passed and refused to ask the United Nations forces to comply, causing the explanation work on the Korean and Chinese side to come to a complete standstill. Although the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission finally arranged isolation facilities on December 10 after repeated requests and urging from the Korean and Chinese side, the explanation work on the Korean and Chinese side remains suspended to this day and cannot be carried out because the American, Rhee, and Chiang special agents in the camp continue to refuse to use the isolation facilities to separately guard the prisoners of war, and some members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission refuse to take firm measures to implement the provisions in the "Detailed Rules" regarding the isolation and custody of prisoners of war. This can only benefit the United States government in achieving its sinister goal of forcibly detaining prisoners of war, and cannot but seriously violate the neutral stance of the neutral nations. We cannot but express our deep regret over this.

VII. We believe that all commissioners from various countries participating in the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, in order to uphold the neutral stance of the neutral nations and safeguard the humanitarian principles of the Geneva Conventions, should earnestly implement the provisions of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work," immediately take firm measures to isolate and guard prisoners of war in the Dongchang-ri prisoner of war camp, thoroughly eliminate all special agents in the prisoner of war camps, break up the terror organizations of the special agents, and replenish the ninety days of explanation time in accordance with the provisions of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" so that the explanation work on the Korean and Chinese side can be resumed. Only in this way can the grave situation currently surrounding the issue of prisoner of war repatriation be changed.
              Beijing, December 16, 1953.

Swiss Federal Government Memorandum of November 25, 1953

(1) In the provisions of June 8, 1953 regarding the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," the issue of prisoner of war repatriation in Korea falls within the jurisdiction of the Neutral Nations Commission, and not the governments that have representatives on the commission; within the commission, the Swiss delegation works autonomously in principle, and the Federal Council only offers opinions to the delegation when it deems it necessary or when the delegation requests it.

(2) For these reasons, the Federal Council believes that the governments of the countries that have representatives on the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission do not need to discuss the issues of the commission and prisoner of war repatriation among themselves. The Federal Political Department's memorandum of October 19 was limited to informing the governments concerned that the Federal Council fully endorsed the Swiss delegation's opposition to the use of force to compel prisoners of war to attend explanation meetings.

(3) The Federal Council explicitly rejects the accusations made against the Swiss representative's attitude. The Swiss representative and the majority of the commission, including the Swiss representative, are in compliance with the provisions of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" of June 8, 1953, and the Geneva Conventions regarding the treatment of prisoners of war in opposing the use of force. They strictly abide by the provisions of international law. If the armistice agreement stipulated the use of coercion, the Federal Council would not have accepted the assignment of a Swiss delegation to participate in the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.

(4) The Federal Council very much hopes that a practical solution can be found within the scope of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" of June 8, 1953, so that each prisoner of war can freely and without any threat of violence decide whether he is prepared to exercise his right of repatriation.

    就朝鲜战俘遣返问题的严重局势
    我外交部受权答复瑞士政府备忘录
    【新华社十六日讯】一九五三年十一月二十五日，瑞士联邦政府政治部（即外交部）曾就有关在朝鲜的战俘遣返问题向波兰人民共和国政府和捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府提出了瑞士联邦政府备忘录一件，同样的备忘录同时通知了中华人民共和国驻伯尔尼公使冯铉。
    一九五三年十二月十六日，中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部副部长章汉夫接见了瑞士驻北京公使任佐立，面交中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部备忘录一件，对于上述瑞士联邦政府备忘录作了答复。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部这一备忘录，已同时分别通知了印度共和国政府、波兰人民共和国政府、捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府和瑞典王国政府。
    以下就是中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部一九五三年十二月十六日备忘录和瑞士联邦政府一九五三年十一月二十五日备忘录的全文。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部答复瑞士联邦政府备忘录
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府已经收到了瑞士联邦政府一九五三年十一月二十五日的备忘录，现在中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部受权提出答复如下：
    一、由于瑞士代表团是受瑞士政府委派来参加在朝鲜的中立国遣返委员会的工作和活动的，所以瑞士政府对它的代表团当然负有责任。瑞士联邦委员会既然已经作出决定并公开声明完全批准瑞士代表团在中立国遣返委员会中所采取的立场，那么瑞士政府当然也就没有理由不与有关各国政府就战俘遣返问题进行讨论。而且，事实上，瑞士政府在它的备忘录中已经向三个有关国家——波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和中华人民共和国，表示了关于战俘遣返问题的意见。
    二、瑞士政府在它的备忘录中，一方面既已表示希望“使每一个战俘能自由地而不受任何暴力威胁地决定是否准备使用他的遣返权利”，另一方面却又反对中立国遣返委员会行使其合法权力来清除那些以暴力威胁战俘不许他们听取解释和要求遣返的特务分子，并把这个问题说成是要中立国遣返委员会“使用武力来强迫战俘出席解释会议”的问题。这是颠倒是非和自相矛盾的。应该说明，要保证每一个战俘能够按照“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”第一、第三两款的规定自由地行使其遣返权利，就必须让中立国遣返委员会充分运用“职权范围”第七款所赋予它的合法权力，包括使用强制手段的权力，来清除那些控制战俘营的特务分子，从而根本解除战俘们所受到的严重的暴力威胁。相反地，如果反对中立国遣返委员会行使其使用强制手段的权力，那么，就是有意要削弱中立国遣返委员会的合法权力，有意要保护特务分子对于战俘的暴力威胁和恐怖统治，其结果必然使战俘根本得不到自由行使其遣返权利的机会。
    三、中立国遣返委员会在它的正式文件中曾经不止一次地承认，在印度部队看管下的战俘营中，朝中被俘人员实际上是受着美国指挥下的李承晚、蒋介石特务的控制，完全没有自由表示其遣返愿望的权利和机会的；战俘如果要求遣返，就不得不冒着极大的生命危险逃出战俘营。这些文件的起草和发表，瑞士委员是参加了的。最近，瑞士委员也曾亲眼看到被截获的李匪特务朴东赫传达给混在战俘营中的李蒋特务们的密令，其中指示特务们如何拒绝和破坏解释工作，如何组织李蒋特务的破坏活动，如何控制和杀害有遣返愿望的战俘，如何加强战俘营中的特务组织和对汉城特务总指挥机关的联系，甚至还委任特务头子以正式官职。这个文件和过去截获的许多类似文件都证明，混在战俘营中的美李蒋特务是由美军总部派去实行恐怖统治、破坏解释工作、以图达到美方强迫扣留战俘的罪恶目的的。试问在特务这样猖獗的暴力控制之下，中立国遣返委员会如果不迅速行使其合法权力，坚决采取有效的步骤，来进行隔离安排，并清除那些特务分子，打散特务恐怖组织，那如何能够进行解释工作？如何能够实施“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”？
    四、瑞士联邦政府备忘录中说：“联邦委员会很希望在一九五三年六月八日‘中立国遣返委员会的职权范围’的范围内能够找到一个实际办法，使每一个战俘能自由地而不受任何暴力威胁地决定是否准备使用他的遣返权利”。“职权范围”内有没有可以解除特务控制的“实际办法”呢？肯定是有的。“职权范围”的第一、第三、第四、第七和第八各款，瑞士政府在未派代表团参加中立国遣返委员会之前，显然是已经知道了的。中立国遣返委员会根据“职权范围”而制定的“解释和访问工作细则”，瑞士代表是参加了的。中立国遣返委员会根据“职权范围”曾于九月二十日一致通过决议，“要求委员会主席作为执行人指示印度看管军司令采取一切可能措施，防止或镇压战俘所犯的暴力行为，并处罚那些犯有这种罪行的人。”十月十六日，中立国遣返委员会又一致通过一项决议，规定印度看管部队在遭到袭击和战俘企图集体逃跑的情况下，可以使用武器。对于这些决议，瑞士代表同其他参加中立国遣返委员会的代表一样，都是赞成的。可是，现在中立国遣返委员会的某些委员无视这些规定和决议，反对对以暴力威胁战俘的特务采取强制手段，反对清除特务，反对由印度部队负责隔离那些已经解释和未经解释的战俘，这样，就使上述规定和决议根本无法实行，中立国遣返委员会因之陷于瘫痪。
    五、日内瓦公约是应该遵守的，人道主义原则是应该保卫的。但是，在美李蒋特务控制之下的东场里战俘营中的情况，却完全违背了日内瓦公约的人道原则。战俘营中特务分子对战俘施行的刺字、割肉、挖心、剖腹等惨无人道的迫害和虐杀，更是直接违反了日内瓦公约第三条关于不得对战俘施以暴力和谋杀的规定。中立国遣返委员会对于这种暴行，由于某些委员反对使用强制手段加以制裁，竟采取了“不行为”的态度，按照日内瓦公约第十三条，这就构成了对于该公约的严重破坏。在这个重大问题上，任何真正维护日内瓦公约和人道原则的政府，是不能不加以严重注意的。
    六、中立国遣返委员会在开始工作时，曾经根据“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”，公布了“解释和访问工作细则”、“给全体战俘的公告”和“关于工作情况的声明”。这些文件，基本上是正确的。中立国遣返委员会的各国委员在处理上述问题时的态度，一般地是公正的。但是，在美国政府的干涉
  和压力之下，中立国遣返委员会的某些委员渐渐地不能坚守这个立场。以解释工作这个中心问题来说，中立国遣返委员会曾经要求朝中方面在联合国军被俘人员营地增设隔离设备，朝中方面当即照办，并
  且联合国军方面已经对他们的被俘人员进行过隔离解释。可是，当朝中方面于十一月十七日提出在朝
  中被俘人员营地亦应增设隔离设备，以便进行隔离解释时，美李蒋特务分子唯恐这种隔离解释会有损于他们的特务统治，不准中立国遣返委员会按照“职权范围”第十八款和“工作细则”第二十款的规定，来进行隔离安排；而中立国遣返委员会的某些委员在美方压力之下，竟公然违背自己通过的规定和诺言，不肯要求联合国军照办，致使朝中方面的解释工作陷于完全停顿。虽然在朝中方面多次的要求和催促之下，中立国遣返委员会终于在十二月十日安排了隔离设备，但是，由于营场中的美李蒋特务继续拒绝使用隔离设备来分别看管战俘，而中立国遣返委员会的某些委员又不肯采取坚决措施，实行“工作细则”中关于隔离看管战俘的规定，以致朝中方面的解释工作停顿至今，仍然无法进行。这在实际上就只能有利于美国政府达到其强迫扣留战俘的罪恶目的，而不能不严重地违反了中立国的公正立场。我们对此不能不深表遗憾。
    七、我们认为，所有参加中立国遣返委员会的各国委员为了坚守中立国的公正立场，并维护日内瓦公约的人道原则，应该切实执行“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”和“解释和访问工作细则”的规定，立即采取坚决措施，在东场里战俘营隔离看管战俘，彻底清除战俘营中的一切特务，打散特务的恐怖组织，并按照“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的规定，补足九十天的解释日期，使朝中方面的解释工作得以恢复进行。只有这样，当前笼罩着战俘遣返问题的严重局势，才能得到改变。
              一九五三年十二月十六日于北京。
    瑞士联邦政府一九五三年十一月二十五日备忘录
    （一）在一九五三年六月八日关于“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的规定中，有关在朝鲜的战俘遣返问题是属于中立国委员会的权限，而不属于在该委员会中派有代表的政府；在该委员会内瑞士代表团原则上是自主地工作的，联邦委员会仅限于它认为必要或当代表团向它提出要求时，才向代表团提出意见。
    （二）由于这些理由，联邦委员会认为在中立国遣返委员会中派有代表的各国政府无须在他们之间去讨论该委员会的和有关战俘遣返的问题。联邦政治部十月十九日的备忘录中，仅限于把联邦委员会完全赞同瑞士代表团反对使用武力来强迫战俘出席解释会议的态度一事告知有关政府。
    （三）联邦委员会明确地拒绝对瑞士代表的态度所作的责难，瑞士代表和包括瑞士代表的委员会多数，在反对使用武力上是符合一九五三年六月八日关于“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”和日内瓦公约关于战俘待遇的规定的，他们严格遵守国际法的规定，如果在停战协定中规定使用强制的话，联邦委员会就不会接受派遣瑞士代表团参加中立国遣返委员会。
    （四）联邦委员会很希望在一九五三年六月八日“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的范围内能够找到一个实际办法，使每一个战俘能自由地而不受任何暴力威胁地决定是否准备使用他的遣返权利。
