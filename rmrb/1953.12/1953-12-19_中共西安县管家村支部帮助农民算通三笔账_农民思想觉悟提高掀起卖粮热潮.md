    CCP Xi'an County Guanjia Village Branch Helps Farmers Calculate Three Accounts
    Raising Farmers' Ideological Awareness and Unleashing a Grain Selling Upsurge
    The CCP Guanjia Village Branch in Xi'an County, Liaodong Province, used the method of helping farmers calculate three accounts to educate them on the general line of the state's transition period. The ideological awareness of the villagers was raised, unleashing an upsurge in selling surplus grain.
    In carrying out the general line education, the CCP Guanjia Village Branch consciously guided farmers to recall the painful days of the past and compare them with the good life of today through exhibitions and discussion meetings. Before liberation, Guanjia Village was known as "Poor Guanjia." At that time, more than 70 percent of the village's more than 400 hectares of land were controlled by landlords and rich peasants. More than 100 of the village's 200 households often lacked food and clothing. After liberation, the farmers of Guanjia Village were allocated land, houses, and draft animals. Over the past four years, the state has loaned the farmers of Guanjia Village more than 200 million yuan, and provided more than 30 sets of cultivator-harrowers, eight Polish plows, and more than 5,000 jin of ammonium sulfate. This summer, the local area experienced continuous rain and lush weeds. Thanks to the use of the more than 30 cultivator-harrowers loaned by the state, the farmers of Guanjia Village were able to cultivate in time, ensuring the normal growth of seedlings. With such strong support from the state, agricultural production in Guanjia Village has increased year by year in recent years, and the lives of farmers have also greatly improved. During the general line education, the CCP Guanjia Village Branch also used the specific facts of the village to educate farmers about the benefits that the development of national industry brings to farmers: Before liberation, the money from 25 jin of sorghum could buy one chi of Qing City cloth; after liberation, in 1949, the money from 12 jin of sorghum could buy one chi of Qing City cloth. By 1951, it only took 9 jin and 4 liang of sorghum to buy one chi of Qing City cloth, and in 1953, it only took 7 jin and 1 liang of sorghum. Farmer Huang Xianzhang, with a family of six, needs 120 chi of cloth every year. In 1949, buying this much cloth would have cost 1,440 jin of sorghum, but this year it only costs 852 jin of sorghum. The whole village has 200 households, each using an average of 100 chi of cloth per year, so the whole village needs 20,000 chi of cloth. In 1949, buying this cloth would have required the money from 240,000 jin of sorghum, but this year it only requires the money from 142,000 jin. By calculating this first account, the villagers realized that the help from the state and the working class to the farmers is enormous, and they also recognized the benefits of national industrial development to the farmers.
    When the CCP Guanjia Village Branch was helping farmers calculate the first account, farmer Fang Xuejin was deeply moved. During this year's autumn harvest, he saw that private merchants were offering higher prices and had promised to sell two shi of soybeans to private merchants. This time, he said he would resolutely not sell to private merchants. The Party branch immediately used this fact to help farmers calculate the second account. This year, Guanjia Village harvested a total of 1.5 million jin of grain. After deducting public grain, seeds, and food for people and horses, there is still a surplus of 400,000 jin. If it were all sold to private merchants, the price of grain per jin would generally increase by 100 yuan. If private merchants were to stir up trouble in the market and then raise the price by 300 yuan per jin, it would cause grain prices to rise in other places, and daily necessities would have to follow suit, and the farmers would suffer. If the surplus grain is all sold to the state to support national industrial construction, the state's industry will develop, and farmers will be able to buy cheap industrial products and use machines to cultivate, producing more grain. With this calculation, the villagers generally realized the benefits of selling surplus grain to the state and said: We must sell all the surplus grain to the state and not let profiteers use grain for speculation and disrupt the good life of the people of the whole country.
    Immediately afterwards, the CCP Guanjia Village Branch led the farmers to calculate the third account, explaining that the more developed the national industry, the more grain is needed. Farmers must produce more grain. If you want to produce more grain, you must organize. In recent years, the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement in Guanjia Village has developed considerably. At present, there are three agricultural production cooperatives, ten year-round mutual aid teams, and one temporary labor exchange team in the village. There are still 27 households in the village that have not been organized. From personal experience, many farmers have deeply realized that mutual aid teams are better than individual farming, and agricultural production cooperatives are even stronger than mutual aid teams. For example, before the farmers of the Sanxing Agricultural Production Cooperative were organized, their land produced only seven shi of grain per hectare of good land. After they were organized, they produced eight shi and five dou of grain. In 1952, the agricultural production cooperative was established, the soil was improved, and some of the land adopted new cultivation methods, producing an average of more than eleven shi of grain per hectare. After recognizing these facts, the farmers of Guanjia Village said that they must run the mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives well, and in the future, they will produce more grain to support industrial construction, so that they can use tractors to cultivate the land as soon as possible. Some individual farmers are also actively requesting to join mutual aid teams.
    After the education of the three accounts, an upsurge of selling grain has been set off in Guanjia Village. According to statistics, the amount of grain that farmers have voluntarily registered to sell has reached more than 320,000 jin.

    中共西安县管家村支部帮助农民算通三笔账
    农民思想觉悟提高掀起卖粮热潮
    中共辽东省西安县管家村支部用帮助农民算三笔账的办法向农民进行国家过渡时期总路线的教育，全村农民思想觉悟提高，掀起了出卖余粮的热潮。
    在进行总路线教育的时候，中共管家村支部通过展览会、讨论会有意识地引导农民回忆过去的痛苦日月，对比今天的好生活。在解放以前，大家都把管家村叫做“穷管家”。那时候，全村四百多垧土地，百分之七十以上掌握在地主、富农手里；全村二百多户人家，有一百多户经常缺吃少穿。解放后，管家村的农民都分得了土地、房屋和耕畜。四年来，国家共贷款给管家村农民二亿余元，贷放铲趟机三十多台、波兰犁八台、硫安五千多斤。今年夏季，当地阴雨连绵，草苗齐长，管家村农民多亏使用了国家贷给的三十多台铲趟机，才做到及时铲趟，保证了禾苗的正常生长。在国家这样大力扶持下，几年来管家村的农业生产一年比一年提高，农民的生活也有了很大改善。在进行总路线教育时，中共管家村支部还用本村的具体事实，教育农民认识国家工业发展给农民带来的好处：解放前，二十五斤高粱的钱买一尺青市布；解放后，一九四九年十二斤高粱的钱买一尺青市布，到一九五一年，买一尺青市布只用九斤四两高粱的钱，一九五三年，只用七斤一两高粱的钱就可以了。农民黄宪章，全家六口人，每年需布一百二十尺。一九四九年买这么多布，得支出一千四百四十斤高粱，今年只用八百五十二斤高粱就够了。全村二百户，每户一年平均穿用一百尺布，全村就需要两万尺布。一九四九年买这些布，需要二十四万斤高粱的钱，今年只要十四万二千斤的钱就够了。通过算这第一笔账，全村农民认识到国家和工人阶级对农民的帮助是十分巨大的，同时也认识了国家发展工业对农民的好处。
    中共管家村支部在帮助农民算第一笔账的时候，农民方学金深深地受了感动。今年秋收当中，他看到私商给的价钱高，曾答应卖给私商两石大豆，这回他表示坚决不卖给私商了。党支部立即用这一事实帮助农民算了第二笔账。今年管家村共打了一百五十万斤粮食，除去公粮、种籽及人吃和喂马的还能余剩四十万斤。如果全把它卖给私商，每斤粮价就会普遍抬高一百元，私商拿到市场上兴风作浪，再每斤抬价三百元，就会引起其他地方粮价上涨，日用品也就得跟着上涨，吃亏的还是农民。要是把余粮全部卖给国家，支持国家工业建设，国家工业发展了，农民就能买便宜的工业品，还能使用机器耕作，打得更多的粮食。这一算，全村农民普遍认识到把余粮卖给国家的好处，纷纷表示：一定把全部余粮卖给国家，不让奸商拿粮食做投机倒把生意，破坏全国人民的好生活。
    紧接着，中共管家村支部又领导农民算了第三笔账，说明国家工业越发展，需要粮食越多，农民就要多生产粮食，要想打粮多，就必须组织起来。几年来，管家村的农业互助合作运动有不小的发展，目前全村有三个农业生产合作社、十个常年互助组、一个临时换工组，全村还有二十七户农民没有组织起来。从切身体验中，很多农民都深深体会到互助组胜过单干，农业生产合作社比互助组还强。比如：三星农业生产合作社的农民在组织起来以前，他们的土地每垧好地只打七石粮，组织起来以后就打了八石五斗粮；一九五二年成立了农业生产合作社，改良了土质，有一部分地采用了新耕作法，每垧地平均打粮十一石多。管家村的农民认清这些事实以后都表示，一定把互助组和农业生产合作社办好，今后要打更多的粮食支援工业建设，好早日使用拖拉机种地。有些单干农民也积极要求参加互助组。
    经过三笔账的教育，管家村农民掀起了卖粮热潮。据统计，现在农民自动登记要卖的粮食已达三十二万多斤。
