Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 9th. General Li Xiangchao, chief member of the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, sent a letter to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on the 8th, opposing the U.S. side sending people to act as "defense attorneys" for the seven special agent murderers who murdered Zhang Zilong. General Li Xiangchao pointed out: "Our side firmly opposes these criminals being provided with so-called 'defense attorneys' from their instigator, the United Nations Command side, to attend the military court and 'defend' these murderers whose hands are stained with the blood of our captured personnel." General Li Xiangchao requested the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to give serious consideration to this matter for the sake of human justice and the dignity of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's military court.

Prior to this, the Indian Custodial Forces Information Office issued news stating that these murderers had requested the U.S. side to provide "defense attorneys" to attend the trial. According to a report from the Indian News Agency from New Delhi on the 8th, "The Chief of the Military Law Office of the United Nations Command," Morrison, would serve as the "defender" for these murderers. However, the Associated Press on the same day described Morrison as an "American civilian," which is obviously because the United Nations Command side is known to have instigated the murder of Zhang Zilong, so the Associated Press was embarrassed to reveal Morrison's true identity and described him as an "American civilian" in an attempt to deceive world opinion.

Note: The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission had previously decided that the Zhang Zilong murder case would be tried on December 11th. The seven murderers of Zhang Zilong were arrested on November 2nd. More than ten of our captured personnel who returned from Camp 28 in Dongchang-ri provided the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission with a large number of facts, proving that these murderers were special agents under the command of the U.S. side. They used various inhumane methods such as hanging, burning, skinning, cutting flesh, nailing, cutting ears, disemboweling, digging out hearts, digging out livers, and cutting buttocks, to kill Zhang Zilong, who demanded repatriation, and finally burned the body to destroy the evidence.

    中立国遣返委员会即将审判谋杀张子龙的美方特务
    我方反对由主谋者充当凶手的“辩护律师”
    【新华社开城九日电】军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员李相朝将军在八日致函中立国遣返委员会，反对美方派人为谋杀张子龙的七名特务凶手作“辩护律师”。李相朝将军指出：“我方坚决反对这些凶犯由他们的主使人联合国军方面获得所谓‘辩护律师’出席军事法庭，为这些双手染满了我方被俘人员的鲜血的凶手作‘辩护’。”李相朝将军要求中立国遣返委员会为了人类正义及中立国遣返委员会军事法庭的尊严，对此作郑重的考虑。
    在此以前，印度看管部队新闻处发布的新闻曾称这些凶手要求由美方获得“辩护律师”出席审判。据印度新闻处八日发自新德里的消息说：“联合国军司令部军法处长”摩里逊将担任这些凶手的“辩护人”。但是，合众社同日却把摩里逊说成是“美国平民”，这显然是因为举世皆知主使特务杀死张子龙的正是联合国军方面，因此合众社也就不好意思说出摩里逊的真正身分，而把他说成是“美国平民”，企图以此欺骗世界舆论。
    按：中立国遣返委员会前曾决定：谋杀张子龙案将于十二月十一日开审。七名谋杀张子龙的凶手是在十一月二日被捕的。自东场里二十八号营场归来的十多名我方被俘人员曾向中立国遣返委员会提供大量事实，证明这些凶手是美方指挥下的特务，他们用吊打、火烧、剥皮、割肉、钉钉子、割耳朵、剖腹、挖心、挖肝、割臀等各种惨无人道的手段，杀死了要求遣返的张子龙，最后并烧尸灭迹。
