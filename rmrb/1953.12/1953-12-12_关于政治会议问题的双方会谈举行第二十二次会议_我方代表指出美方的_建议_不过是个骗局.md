Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 11th. The delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China participating in the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference issued the following communique:

    The twenty-second meeting of the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference was held on December 11th. Our representative, Mr. Qi Shifu, used the voting procedure proposed by the other side as an example to expose that the other side's so-called "draft proposal" was not only full of loopholes and extremely unreasonable, but also a deception, and therefore could not be used as the basis for a bilateral agreement. Mr. Qi Shifu pointed out: According to the other side's voting procedure, the other side will participate in the voting as a single unit, and how each country on the other side votes is an "internal matter" for the other side. In that case, any country on the other side can "freely" agree or disagree with a certain agreement, and can only be bound by the agreement it agrees to, and can not abide by the agreement reached by the other side participating in the vote as a unit. If this is the case, what is the significance of the other side's participation in the vote as a unit? For example, if the political conference discusses the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and the other side, as a unit, agrees to unify Korea peacefully without using force, but South Korea's Syngman Rhee wants to "unify by advancing north" with military force and refuses to be bound by this agreement, then what value will this agreement have even if it is reached and signed? If, when discussing the withdrawal of foreign troops, the other side votes as a unit to agree to this agreement, but the United States opposes it based on the other side's declared principles and is not bound by this agreement, then what is the significance of such an agreement? As for the so-called "draft proposal" put forward by the other side on December 8th, although it formally admits that both sides should invite some neutral countries to participate in the political conference, the so-called Foreign Minister of the South Korean government, Byun Young-tae, publicly declared that the South Korean government opposes any such country, whether it is Asian or European. Then people cannot help but ask: Does the other side's proposal represent the South Korean government? If it does not represent the South Korean government, how can the other side become a unit without South Korea? If it does represent the South Korean government, why does South Korea's Byun Young-tae oppose Mr. Dean, who represents the seventeen countries participating in the Korean War?

    The US representative, Dean, was unable to answer under our questioning and had to evade the question, instead repeating his unreasonable demands for neutral countries to participate in the political conference, still stubbornly denying the neutral status of the Soviet Union regardless of the facts, and still insisting on his unreasonable restrictions on the authority of neutral countries to participate in the political conference.

    Our representative, Mr. Qi Shifu, spoke again and pointed out that the other side's statement further proved that the other side was still using various methods to prevent neutral countries from participating in the political conference. On the one hand, the other side ignores the facts and opposes the Soviet Union's participation in the political conference as a neutral country. On the other hand, it makes various regulations to restrict the authority of neutral countries to participate in the political conference. The other side opposes our clear stipulation that neutral countries should have full freedom to participate in the meeting, provide their useful opinions, and mediate, except for having no voting rights. It requires that every move of the neutral countries in the meeting must be agreed to by both parties, that is, it must be approved by the US government. Doesn't this prove that the other side is actually preventing neutral countries from participating in the meeting?

    Finally, Mr. Qi Shifu condemned the other side's absurd threatening attitude. Mr. Qi Shifu pointed out that the other side claimed outside the meeting that its "draft proposal" was a "final proposal." Since it is a "final proposal," that means the other side is no longer prepared to conduct any discussions, but the other side does not dare to bear the responsibility for breaking up the talks, so it pretends to be willing to continue the talks, but on the other hand, it refuses to conduct any serious discussions, attempting to shift the responsibility for delaying and threatening to interrupt the talks onto our side. Mr. Qi Shifu pointed out that threats and intimidation will not have any effect on our side. If the other side is still willing to hold talks, it should abandon this despicable means and honestly conduct serious discussions based on our comprehensive and reasonable suggestions.

    关于政治会议问题的双方会谈举行第二十二次会议
    我方代表指出美方的“建议”不过是个骗局
    【新华社开城十一日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国参加关于政治会议问题双方会谈的代表团发表公报如下：
    十二月十一日，关于政治会议问题的双方会谈举行第二十二次会议。我方代表奇石福先生以对方建议的表决程序为例，揭露对方的所谓“建议草案”不但漏洞百出，极不合理，而且是一个骗局，因而不能作为双方协议的基础。奇石福先生指出：按照对方的表决程序，对方将作为一个单位参加表决，对方各国如何投票则是对方“内部的事务”，那样对方的任何一个国家可以“自由”地同意某一项协议或不同意某一项协议，并只受它自己所同意的协议的约束，而可以不遵守对方作为一个单位参加表决所达成的协议。如果是这样，对方作为一个单位参加的表决又有什么意义？举例说，如果政治会议讨论和平解决朝鲜问题时，对方作为一个单位同意用和平方法统一朝鲜而不使用武力，然而南朝鲜李承晚却要以军事力量“北进统一”，拒绝受这个协议的约束，那么这个协议即使达成并签了字，又有什么价值？如果在讨论撤退外国军队时，对方作为单位表决同意了这一协议，但美国却根据对方原则声明反对，不受这一协议的约束，请问如此达成的协议又有何意义？如对方在十二月八日所提出的所谓“建议草案” ，尽管在形式上总算是承认了双方应邀请某些中立国参加政治会议，然而对方的南朝鲜政府的所谓外务部长官卞荣泰却公开宣称南朝鲜政府反对任何此种国家，不论其为亚洲的或欧洲的，那么人们不免要问：对方提出这一建议，究竟代表不代表南朝鲜政府呢？如果不代表，缺了南朝鲜，对方又如何能成为一个单位？如果代表，为什么南朝鲜政府的卞荣泰又反对作为参加侵略朝鲜战争的十七国代表的迪安先生呢？
    美方代表迪安在我方质问之下无法回答，不得不逃避问题，转而重复其对中立国参加政治会议的无理主张，仍然一味不顾事实，否认苏联的中立地位，仍然坚持其对中立国参加政治会议的权限加以种种无理限制的主张。
    我方代表奇石福先生再度发言指出：对方的发言更加证明对方仍在用各种方法阻止中立国参加政治会议。对方一方面不顾事实，反对苏联以中立国身分参加政治会议，另一方面又作出种种规定，多方限制中立国参加政治会议的权限。对方反对我方明确规定中立国除无表决权外应有参加会议与提供其有益意见及进行斡旋的充分自由的原则，要求中立国在会议中的一举一动都要经过双方同意才能进行，亦即须经美国政府的批准，这岂不证明对方实际上在阻止中立国参加会议吗？
    最后，奇石福先生斥责了对方荒谬的威胁态度。奇石福先生指出，对方在会外宣称其“建议草案”是“最后的建议”，既然是“最后的建议”，那就是说对方不再准备进行任何讨论，但对方又不敢承担破裂会谈的责任，因此诡称愿意继续进行会谈，另一方面却又拒绝进行任何认真的讨论，妄图把拖延与威胁中断会谈的责任推在我方身上。奇石福先生指出，威胁与恐吓对我方不会发生任何作用。对方如果还愿意进行会谈，就应放弃这一套可鄙的手段，老老实实根据我方全面合理的建议进行认真的讨论。
