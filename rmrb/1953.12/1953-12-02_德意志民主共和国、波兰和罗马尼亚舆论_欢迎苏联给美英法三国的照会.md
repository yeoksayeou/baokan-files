Xinhua News Agency, December 1st—According to TASS: Newspapers in the German Democratic Republic, Poland, and Romania warmly welcome the Soviet government's November 26th note to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France regarding the Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference.

    "Neues Deutschland" stated that the Soviet government has repeatedly strived for the peaceful resolution of all international disputes, particularly the German question. The newspaper emphasized: In reality, it is the Western countries, primarily the United States, that are obstructing negotiations. "National-Zeitung" welcomed the Soviet government's new peace initiative and emphasized that the Soviet Union is unflinchingly and patiently pursuing its peace policy. The newspaper fully agreed with the Soviet note's assessment of the aggressive nature of the so-called "European Army," pointing out that the "European Army" would pit one part of Germany against the other.

    Polish newspapers emphasized the significance of the Soviet government's note in easing international tensions. "Trybuna Ludu" wrote in its editorial: "The position taken by the Soviet government in its recent note is a natural result of the Soviet Union's entire peace policy. The history of recent years proves that the Soviet Union has always hoped to ease international tensions and has taken concrete steps to this end; the Soviet Union has tirelessly strived for a peaceful resolution of the German question." The newspaper continued: "To ease international tensions and resolve the German question, it is necessary to resolutely resist the policy of establishing a new Hitlerite 'Wehrmacht' under the guise of the 'European Army.' This has been stated clearly and thoroughly in the Soviet note. This is also the deepest conviction of the people of Eastern and Western Europe." "Głos Pracy" wrote: "The people of Europe believe that a solution to the German question is possible, but not through the revival of the 'Wehrmacht,' but through consultations among the four major powers..." The newspaper pointed out that the issues the Soviet note suggested for discussion at the Foreign Ministers' Conference could be broader, and first and foremost, measures to ease international tensions must be studied. That is to say, the convening of a five-power foreign ministers' conference of France, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China is a matter of utmost urgency.

    Romanian newspapers widely commented on the Soviet government's November 26th note. "Scînteia" pointed out that the Soviet government's note is "another convincing action of the Soviet Union's consistent pursuit of a peace policy." The newspaper pointed out that the views in the Soviet note not only represent the views of the Soviet government but are also supported by all peace-loving countries, especially those that have suffered from the ravages of German militarism. For the sake of peace and security in Europe and the world, a solution to the German question should be found according to the path indicated by the Soviet proposal.

    德意志民主共和国、波兰和罗马尼亚舆论
    欢迎苏联给美英法三国的照会
    【新华社一日讯】据塔斯社讯：德意志民主共和国、波兰和罗马尼亚各报热烈欢迎苏联政府十一月二十六日给美、英、法三国政府关于四国外长会议的照会。
      “新德意志报”说，苏联政府曾不止一次地为和平解决一切国际争端、特别是德国问题而努力。该报着重说：实际上，阻挠谈判的是西方国家，首先是美国。“国民日报”欢迎苏联政府新的和平倡议，并着重指出苏联不屈不挠地和耐心地执行自己的和平政策。该报完全赞同苏联照会中对所谓“欧洲军”的侵略性质所作的估计，并指出，“欧洲军”将使德国的一部分和另一部分对立起来。
    波兰各报着重指出苏联政府的照会对于缓和国际紧张局势的意义。“人民论坛报”在社论中写道：“苏联政府在它最近的照会中所采取的立场是苏联整个和平政策的自然的结果。近几年来的历史证明，苏联一直是希望缓和国际紧张局势的，并为此采取了具体的步骤；苏联一直是不倦地为和平解决德国问题而努力的。”该报接着写道：“缓和国际紧张局势和解决德国问题，必须要坚决反抗以‘欧洲军’为幌子来建立新希特勒‘国防军’的政策。这一点已在苏联照会中说得明白而透彻。这一点也是东欧和西欧各国人民的最深刻的信念。”“劳动之声报”写道：“欧洲人民认为，德国问题的解决是可能的，但不是通过复活‘国防军’的办法，而是通过四大国协商的办法……”该报指出苏联照会同时建议外长会议讨论的问题可以更加广泛一些，首先必须研究缓和国际紧张局势的措施。这就是说，法国、英国、美国、苏联和中华人民共和国五国外长会议的召开是刻不容缓的事情。
    罗马尼亚报纸广泛地评论苏联政府十一月二十六日的照会。“火花报”指出，苏联政府的照会，是苏联“始终不渝地奉行和平政策的又一次令人信服的行动”。该报指出，苏联照会中的观点不仅是代表苏联政府的观点，也是受到所有爱好和平的国家、首先是遭受过德国军国主义蹂躏的国家所支持的观点。为了欧洲和全世界的和平与安全的利益，应当根据苏联的建议所指出的途径，找出解决德国问题的方法。
