Xinhua News Agency, December 24th. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions sent a letter on December 23rd to all employees of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, congratulating them on the commencement of production of the Large Rolling Mill, Seamless Steel Tube Plant, and No. 7 Blast Furnace. The congratulatory letter is as follows:

To the Anshan City Federation of Trade Unions, forwarded to all employees of Anshan Iron and Steel Company:

The three major projects of Anshan Iron and Steel Company: the newly built Seamless Steel Tube Plant, the Large Rolling Mill, and the reconstructed and automated No. 7 Blast Furnace, have been victoriously completed and officially commenced production. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions is pleased to extend warm congratulations to all workers, technicians, staff, and leading cadres of all departments of Anshan Iron and Steel. Congratulations on your extraordinary achievements.

The completion of the three major projects is a manifestation of the extremely powerful strength of the new China under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and a new victory for the general line of our country during the transition period. The three major projects are a glorious chapter in the history of socialist industrialization in our country, and one of the most memorable major events in our country's industrial construction in 1953. The three major projects will play a significant role in the socialist industrialization of our country.

The three major projects are the crystallization of the unbreakable great friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. We all understand that projects of such immense scale, technical complexity, and extremely high technical standards could not have been carried out without the guidance and assistance of Soviet experts. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, in the solemn name of the Chinese working class, expresses its heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet experts who helped us with the construction. Soviet experts are not only our teachers in technology, but also our best teachers in the spirit of great internationalism and excellent work style.

The three major projects are a heroic undertaking. Such projects are very unfamiliar to our country's workers, technicians, staff, and leading cadres, and it is indeed an arduous task. However, with the assistance of Soviet experts, all comrades of Anshan Iron and Steel have carried forward the fine traditions of the Chinese working class, conquered all kinds of difficulties, and put forward many new creations, so that the quality of the projects has been praised by Soviet experts, and their own technical and management levels have been greatly improved. Comrades, you have set a very good example for the working brothers across the country.

The three major projects are also the crystallization of the concerted efforts of workers across the country, and the crystallization of the worker-peasant alliance. Everyone understands that without the support of working brothers and farming brothers from all over the country, Anshan Iron and Steel alone could not have completed such a huge task.

The Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, our great leader Chairman Mao, are very concerned about the work of Anshan Iron and Steel, and very concerned about all the employees of Anshan Iron and Steel, and have mobilized the strength of the people of the whole country to support you. At the same time, it is precisely under the leadership of the Party, the government, and Chairman Mao that you have been able to unleash your great strength and ensure the successful completion of the project.

Comrades, the people of the whole country, the working brothers of the whole country, are all cheering for the victorious completion and official commencement of the three major projects, thanking you, praising you, envying you, and learning from you. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions believes that you will never be arrogant, and believes that you will study more humbly, study harder from Soviet experts, work harder, and believes that you will make greater contributions to the country and the people. I wish you new and greater success.

In addition to sending Comrade Liu Ziju to congratulate you in person, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions is specially sending two 35mm movie projectors as congratulatory gifts to you.

                All-China Federation of Trade Unions

    中华全国总工会写信给鞍钢全体职工
    祝贺鞍钢三大工程胜利开工生产
        【新华社二十四日讯】中华全国总工会于十二月二十三日致信鞍山钢铁公司全体职工，祝贺大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂和第七号炼铁炉开工生产。贺信如下：鞍山市工会联合会转鞍山钢铁公司全体职工同志们：
    鞍山钢铁公司新建无缝钢管厂、大型轧钢厂和改建自动化七号炼铁炉三大工程已经胜利完成并正式开工生产了。中华全国总工会欣慰地向鞍钢全体工人、技术人员、职员和各部门领导干部致以热烈的祝贺。祝贺你们非凡的成就。
    三大工程的完成，是中国共产党领导下的新中国具有极为强大的力量的表现，是我们国家过渡时期的总路线的一个新的胜利。三大工程在我国社会主义工业化的历史上是辉煌的一篇，是我国在一九五三年工业建设上的一项最值得纪念的大事。三大工程将对我们国家的社会主义工业化起重大的作用。
    三大工程，是中苏两国人民牢不可破的伟大友谊的结晶。我们大家都明白，像这样规模巨大、技术复杂、技术标准极高的工程，如果没有苏联专家的指导和帮助，是不可能进行的。中华全国总工会谨以中国工人阶级的庄严名义，向帮助我们建设的苏联专家致以衷心的感谢。苏联专家，不但在技术上是我们的老师，在伟大的国际主义的精神和极优良的工作作风上面，也是我们最好的老师。
    三大工程乃是英雄的事业。这样的工程，对于我国的工人、技术人员、职员和领导干部说来，都是十分生疏的，这的确是一项艰巨的任务。但是，鞍钢的全体同志在苏联专家帮助下，发挥了中国工人阶级的优良传统，把种种困难都征服了，提出了许许多多的新创造，使得工程的质量受到了苏联专家的称赞，并大大地提高了自己的技术水平和管理水平。同志们，你们给全国工人弟兄树立了很好的榜样。
    三大工程，也是全国工人齐心努力的结晶，是工农联盟的结晶。大家都明白，如果没有各地工人弟兄和农民弟兄的支援，单靠鞍钢自己，是不能完成这样巨大的任务的。
    中国共产党，中央人民政府，我们的伟大的领袖毛主席，非常关怀鞍钢的工作，非常关怀鞍钢的全体职工，动员了全国人民的力量来支援你们。同时，正是在党、政府和毛主席的领导下，你们才得以发挥出伟大的力量，保证了工程的胜利完成。
    同志们，全国人民、全国工人弟兄，都为了三大工程的胜利完成和正式开工而欢呼，都感谢你们，称赞你们，羡慕你们，学习你们。中华全国总工会相信你们决不会骄傲，相信你们会更加虚心地学习，更加努力地向苏联专家学习，更加努力地工作，相信你们会对国家对人民有更大的贡献。祝你们获得新的、更大的成功。
    中华全国总工会除派刘子久同志亲临祝贺而外，特送上三十五粍电影机两部，做为对你们祝贺的礼物。
                中华全国总工会
                一九五三年十二月二十三日
