Experiences in the Development of Shangzhuang Agricultural Implement Production Cooperative
Shang Zhan

The Shangzhuang Agricultural Implement Production Cooperative in Yancheng, Jiangsu, was established at the end of 1951. It now has 20 members, including five blacksmiths and fifteen carpenters. The iron workshop has three small furnaces, and the wood workshop has two teams. All production tools are publicly owned. The cooperative has a working capital of 123.2 million yuan and fixed assets of 12.12 million yuan. Of this, shares account for only 2.7 million yuan, long-term interest-free loans from the local government are 96 million yuan, advance payments from the supply and marketing cooperative are 25 million yuan, and public accumulation special funds and undistributed profits are 11.12 million yuan. The cooperative produces over 100 kinds of products. The total output value in 1952 was 116 million yuan, and in the first half of 1953 it was over 93 million yuan. Of this, wood products accounted for 70% of the total value, and iron products accounted for 30%. In addition, a large proportion of work involves repairing old tools. According to seasonal characteristics, the spring and summer seasons are dedicated to manufacturing and repairing agricultural implements, while the autumn and winter seasons are also used to make some furniture.

The existence and development of the Shangzhuang Agricultural Implement Cooperative are due to the establishment of good production and sales relationships with relevant parties. They conduct production and sales integration through the following methods:

(1) Determining the objects of production and sales integration. This year, the Yancheng County Supply and Marketing Cooperative divided the county's five agricultural implement cooperatives and fifty-seven supply and marketing cooperatives according to their production and supply capacity, further improving the production and sales integration. For example, although the Shangzhuang Agricultural Implement Cooperative also signed a production and sales contract last year, the designation of seven supply and marketing cooperatives as its service targets this year has made the integration objects more fixed and provided a greater guarantee for production and sales integration.

(2) Establishing regular production and sales integration relationships, and communicating the relationship between the agricultural implement production cooperative and the supply and marketing cooperative, as well as between the supply and marketing cooperative and mutual aid teams. This is the main method used by the Shangzhuang Agricultural Implement Cooperative to promote its products. In 1952, the value of the annual production and sales integration contract signed with the supply and marketing cooperative was over 90 million yuan, accounting for 73.7% of the annual sales. In 1953, annual production and sales integration contracts were signed with the newly designated seven supply and marketing cooperatives, totaling over 130 million yuan. Most of these supply and marketing cooperatives, in turn, signed quarterly supply combination contracts with mutual aid teams as pilot projects, in order to summarize and promote the experience of organizing the supply of agricultural implements. This not only solved the sales problems of the agricultural implement cooperative but also met the needs of the supply and marketing cooperative members for agricultural implements. It should be particularly pointed out that the characteristic of this relationship is that the difficulties of the agricultural implement cooperative in the off-season are resolved with the help of the supply and marketing cooperative. At the same time, when the agricultural implement cooperative delivers goods, it still guarantees a certain profit for the supply and marketing cooperative, giving appropriate discounts on prices to compensate for the supply and marketing cooperative's burden of interest on reserves, etc.

(3) In order to effectively implement the integration contract, formulate a plan for supplying agricultural implements and attach importance to investigating the needs of farmers. The supply and marketing cooperative formulates a plan for supplying agricultural implements based on the needs of farmers, referring to the sales of agricultural implements in previous years and the sales volume of agricultural implements in the market. Their investigation methods are:

	1. Comprehensive investigation—through mutual aid teams and administrative groups, a comprehensive investigation of the quantity and type of agricultural implements needed by the members;
	2. Investigation of typical villages—selected typical villages in different regions such as paddy fields, rice and wheat fields, and wheat fields to investigate the quantity and type of agricultural implements needed by farmers, and then extrapolate the agricultural implement needs of farmers within their respective scope;
	3. Investigation of typical mutual aid teams—supply and marketing cooperatives mostly adopt the method of establishing a quarterly supply of agricultural implements combination contract with typical pilot mutual aid teams and conduct an investigation each time the contract is signed;
	4. Estimate the supplementary parts based on the number of large agricultural implements. For example, investigate the number of waterwheels currently owned by farmers, and based on existing experience, estimate the number of paddles and wedges that should be supplemented for each waterwheel each year, and extrapolate the supplementary needs of farmers within its scope;
	5. Solicit farmers’ opinions through meetings. For example, the Shangzhuang Central Supply and Marketing Cooperative invites members of the agricultural implement cooperative to participate in each meeting of the members’ representatives to understand the opinions of the supply and marketing cooperative members on agricultural implements.

(4) Ensuring the quality, specifications, and reasonable prices of products, and expanding product sales. In terms of price, the production cooperative adheres to the principle of "lower than market prices, ensuring a certain reasonable profit." In general, the prices of the Shangzhuang Agricultural Implement Cooperative are generally lower than market prices. For example, the market price of iron nails is 3,000 to 4,000 yuan per catty, while the agricultural implement cooperative sells them for 2,400 yuan; the market price of paddles is 350 yuan, while the agricultural implement cooperative sells them for 320 yuan; the market price of iron spades is 4,200 yuan, while the agricultural implement cooperative sells them for 3,300 yuan. Farmers feel that the products of the agricultural implement cooperative are reasonably priced and of good quality.

In terms of price differences between peak and off-seasons, the law of the free market is to raise prices arbitrarily in the peak season and depress prices arbitrarily in the off-season. For example, a sickle costs 8,400 yuan in the peak season and drops to 4,000 yuan in the off-season. However, the Shangzhuang Agricultural Implement Cooperative maintains reasonable prices regardless of the peak or off-season, which plays a stabilizing role in market prices. This is also one of the important conditions for the agricultural implement cooperative to create and open up sales channels and ensure production and sales integration.

(5) In particular, the carpentry workshop provides on-site repair services, which is not only suitable for the decentralized operation of rural areas but also overcomes the difficulty of surplus labor in the off-season. Farmers reported: "It's good, fast, and saves materials," and the repair wages are also reasonable. Individual carpenters charge a full day's wages for half a day's work, while the members of the agricultural implement cooperative charge half a day's wages for half a day's work, and they arrive early when called early and arrive late when called late. For example, the Hu Rongyu Mutual Aid Team reported: "The waterwheel needs to be used in the morning, and the members of the agricultural implement cooperative came to repair it before dawn, which moved me very much."

This planned production and sales integration has also prompted the agricultural implement cooperative to gradually establish various systems such as production plans, product inspections, raw material issuance, and cost accounting, which further guarantees the consolidation and development of production and sales integration.

The production and sales integration of the Shangzhuang Agricultural Implement Cooperative and the supply and marketing cooperative is carried out in accordance with the principle of mutual assistance and mutual benefit, and has therefore achieved many results. However, there are still problems in the implementation of the contract. That is, the implementation of this year's contract is not as good as last year. In 1952, both parties completed 83.5%, while in the first half of this year, the average was only 65.14%. The reasons for the poor implementation of the contract in the first half of this year are due to the insufficient supply of products from the agricultural implement cooperative and the overestimation of the original plan. At the same time, the agricultural implement cooperative established its own retail department and expanded its self-production and self-sales, which affected the completion of the integration contract. This must be studied in the future and rationally resolved.

The development and consolidation of the Shangzhuang Agricultural Implement Cooperative is inseparable from the support and assistance of the supply and marketing cooperative. For example, the supply and marketing cooperative provides long-term advance payments of up to 25 million yuan, which is not something that a single supply and marketing cooperative can afford. Of the above-mentioned advance payments, in addition to the Shangzhuang Central Supply and Marketing Cooperative bearing 10 million yuan, the remaining 15 million yuan is borne by several grass-roots supply and marketing cooperatives, each bearing 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Furthermore, the director of the agricultural implement cooperative is currently also the first deputy director of the supply and marketing cooperative, and most of his energy is devoted to the work of the agricultural implement cooperative, but his salary is still paid by the supply and marketing cooperative. This is a model example of the supply and marketing cooperative organizing handicraft production to serve agricultural production. Supply and marketing cooperatives and production cooperatives at all levels should attach importance to this experience of production and sales integration as a reference for carrying out work and business.

    尚庄农具生产合作社发展的经验
    尚展
    江苏盐城尚庄农具生产合作社是在一九五一年底成立的，现有社员二十人，其中铁业社员五人，木业社员十五人。铁业有小炉三个，木业为两个小组，生产工具全部公有。流动资金有一亿二千三百余万元，固定资金有一千二百余万元。其中股金只二百七十万元，地方政府长期无利贷款九千六百余万元，供销社预付货款二千五百余万元，公共积累特种基金和未分配的盈余一千一百余万元。产品约在一百种以上，一九五二年生产总值为一亿一千六百余万元，一九五三年上半年生产总值为九千三百多万元。其中木业占总值百分之七十，铁业占总值百分之三十。此外，还有极大比重的修旧工作，根据季节性的特点，春夏两季是全力制造和修理农具，秋冬两季兼做一些家具。
    尚庄农具社的存在和发展是由于和有关方面建立了良好的产销结合关系，他们是通过下列一些方法进行产销结合的。
    （一）确定产销结合的对象。今年盐城县供销合作总社把全县五个农具社和五十七个供销社，按生产的供应能力，划分了产销范围，使产销结合更提高了一步。如尚庄农具社虽然去年也订立了产销合同，但今年由于划分了七个供销社为它的服务对象，使结合的对象更固定，产销结合更有了保证。
    （二）建立经常性的产销结合关系，沟通农具生产社和供销社以及供销社和互助组之间的关系。这是尚庄农具社推销产品的主要方法。一九五二年通过和供销社订立的全年产销结合合同价值九千余万元，占全年销货额的百分之七十三点七。一九五三年和新划分的七个供销社签订了全年产销结合合同，共值一亿三千余万元。其中大部分供销社又转与作为典型试办的互助组订立了季度的供应结合合同，以便于总结和推广组织农具供应工作的经验。这样既解决了农具社的产品销路，又满足了供销社社员的农具需要。特别应该提出的，这种关系的特点，乃是农具社的淡季困难由供销社帮助得到解决。同时农具社给货时，仍保证供销社一定的利润，在价格上给予适当的折扣，以弥补供销社在担负储备上的利息等方面的负担。
    （三）为着切实有效地执行结合合同，制定供应农具的计划，重视调查农民的需要。供销社根据农民的需要，参考历年销售农具的情况及市场农具销售量，来制定农具的供应计划。他们的调查方法是：
    1．全面性的调查——通过互助组和行政小组，全面的调查一次社员需要的农具的数量和种类；
    2．典型村的调查——选择了水田、稻麦田和麦田等不同地区的典型村，调查了农民需要农具的数量和种类，然后再推算其所属范围内农民需要农具的情况；
    3．典型互助组的调查——供销社大多是采取了典型试办和互助组建立季度供应农具的结合合同，每季订合同时，进行一次调查；
    4．从大型农具的数量，估计添补零件情况，如调查农民现有水车的数量，根据已有经验，估计每台水车每年应添补柫板和榷子的数量，推算出其所属范围内农民需要添补的情况；
    5．通过会议吸收农民意见，例如尚庄中心供销社，每次开社员代表大会时，都吸收农具社的社员参加，以了解供销社社员对农具方面的反映。
    （四）保证了产品的质量、规格和合理的价格，扩大了产品销路。在价格上生产社是掌握了“低于市价、保证一定合理利润”的原则。总的情况是，尚庄农具社的价格一般均低于市价。如铁钉市价每斤三千至四千元，农具社是二千四百元；柫板市价是三百五十元，农具社是三百二十元；铁?市价是四千二百元，农具社是三千三百元，农民感到农具社的产品价格合算，品质又好。
    在淡旺季差价上，自由市场的规律是，旺季乱抬价，淡季乱压价。如一把镰刀，旺季是八千四百元，淡季便降为四千元。而尚庄农具社不管淡、旺季都保持合理的价格，这对市场价格就起了稳定作用。而这也是农具社创造和打开销路，保证产销结合的重要条件之一。
    （五）特别是木业出门修旧，既是适合农村分散的经营方法，同时也克服了本身淡季劳动力剩余的困难。农民反映：“又好，又快，又省料”，修旧工资又合理。单干户的木匠做半天就算一天工资，农具社的社员是做半天算半天，而且是早叫早到，晚叫晚到。如胡荣余互助组反映：“水车早上要用，农具社的社员天未亮就来修理，使我很感动。”
    这种有计划的产销结合，也促使农具社逐步地订立了生产计划，产品检查，原料领发，成本计算等各种制度，进一步保证了产销结合的巩固和发展。
    尚庄农具社和供销社的产销结合，是按照互助互利的原则进行的，因而取得不少成绩。但是在执行合同中也还有问题。这就是今年合同的执行情况还不如去年好，一九五二年双方均完成了百分之八十三点五，今年上半年平均只完成了百分之六十五点一四。今年上半年合同执行差的原因，是由于农具社的产品不足及原计划订得过高，同时农具社自己设立了门市部，扩大了自产自销，影响了结合合同的完成。这是今后必须加以研究并设法合理解决的。
    尚庄农具社的发展和巩固是和供销社的扶植和帮助分不开的，例如供销社长期的预付货款即达二千五百余万元，这种扶助也不是一个供销社所能担负的。上述预付货款中除尚庄中心供销社担负一千万元外，其余一千五百余万元是由几个基层供销社各担负了二百到三百万元。又如现在农具社的主任是由供销社第一副主任兼任的，其大部分精力是做农具社的工作，但其工资仍由供销社发给。这是供销社组织手工业生产解决货源为农业生产服务的一个模范事例，各级供销社和生产社应重视这一产销结合经验，作为进行工作和业务的参考。
