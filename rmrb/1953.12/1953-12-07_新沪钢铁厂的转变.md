The Transformation of the New Shanghai Steel Factory
Lu Chaoqi

I. In Days of Difficulty

The New Shanghai Steel Factory was formed after liberation by merging several small factories. It now has four production workshops that are not connected in production: steel rolling, cold casting, horse iron, and screw workshops, manufacturing six main products: steel, train wheels, rolling mills, horse iron, screws, and nuts. The equipment and buildings are old, and a considerable amount of the production process is manual.

Before January of this year, this factory frequently failed to meet the state plan. Last year, of the six main products, only steel exceeded the output and quality targets. The others only completed 52% to 84% of the output targets, and the quality pass rate was only 50% to 70%. Yet, people were complacent about this situation. From top to bottom, the entire factory largely mistakenly believed: "The state plan can be completed, or it can be not completed." Not only were the workers looking out for themselves, but many workers did not observe labor discipline. When it was time to start work, they slowly entered the workshop to change clothes, find tools, and find materials... half an hour, an hour passed in vain. Before getting off work, some people went to change clothes and take showers.

The chaotic situation was also reflected in other aspects. The supply and sales units did not accept orders based on production conditions. There were many incidents of being fined for late delivery. This was not only because the supply and sales departments did not consider production conditions when accepting orders, but also because there was no system or plan in production management. Several state-owned factories ordered two hundred rolling mills. The technical personnel drew the drawings, the workers painstakingly made the models, poured the molten iron, and cleaned them, but they were thrown aside without processing—the final step. No one cared about them later. When the ordering units came to pick up the goods, everyone panicked and rushed to process them. Employees were tired from overtime, and the factory was fined for late delivery. For example, the Shanghai Railway Administration ordered 1,500 sets of inner and outer clips (four clips per set) for railway use. The contract clearly stated that they should be 10 centimeters, but they were all made 11 centimeters. When the railway bureau came to pick up the goods, they found that they were incorrect. What should be done? Modify them! As a result of the hasty modifications, almost all previous efforts were wasted—5,300 of the 6,000 outer clips were broken, and 4,000 of the 6,000 inner clips were broken!

Excessive fines, backlogs, and waste depleted all working capital. There was no money to turn over profits, and the horse iron workshop could not afford to buy a grinding wheel for tens of thousands of yuan. The head of the finance section was called a "poor devil." The factory's situation was like that of a bank that had declared bankruptcy. The state bank froze the factory's funds, declaring that all the bills it issued were invalid. Fines and disputes came one after another, and sometimes people even sued in court. Customers lost confidence in it and dared not place orders again. Some who had already signed orders even requested to stop the execution of the contract. The leading authorities once ordered a major workshop in the factory to stop production!

II. The Deepest Feelings

Last autumn, the Industry Department of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee organized a study tour to the Northeast to learn the experience of implementing technical operating procedures to improve product quality. The director of the New Shanghai Steel Factory placed great hope on this visit. He believed that the factory's fatal flaw at that time was the quality problem. Therefore, if they learned a set of experiences in improving product quality from the Northeast, it might be able to save the factory from its embarrassing state.

As the saying goes, "It's not that you don't know the goods, it's that you're afraid of comparing goods." When the factory director entered the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, entered the advanced factories in Fushun and Dalian, and came into contact with the cadres and workers there, his eyes lit up and became sharp. He saw his own shortcomings from the advantages of others.

There were indeed experiences in improving product quality worth learning there. However, what made the deepest impression was not the quality issue, but how a worker, a Communist Party member, especially a leader of an enterprise, should treat the state plan.

No matter who they talked to about what issue, as long as it was related to production, people always proudly started from the plan, not only talking about the numbers, but also talking about what methods to use to complete it. People regarded the plan as sacred, something that must be completed, as a program of action, as a goal for employees to strive for. "But what is it like in our factory?" The director of the New Shanghai Steel Factory asked himself this question every time, and then answered himself: "Quite the opposite. Our leading cadres think that making plans is to cope with the superiors, and the employees think that the plan is a 'celestial book'—impossible to complete. We think that the state plan can be completed or not completed!"

"If only the employees of our factory had such a strong concept of planning!"

An increasingly strong desire to improve enterprise management occupied him. After learning the experiences in improving product quality, they specifically spent three days at the Dalian Steel Plant to learn how to prepare workshop operation plans.

III. Firmly Grasp the Operation Plan

After the factory director returned to the factory at the end of November last year, under the leadership of the Party committee, he used all meetings and opportunities to tell the cadres what he had seen and felt in the Northeast, as well as the leadership's determination—to improve production by implementing the operation plan. He demanded that they not wait, but act immediately. At that time, no one in the factory knew what an operation plan was, so he personally helped the horse iron workshop to set an example for everyone to see.

The implementation of the operation plan in the four production workshops throughout the factory began in January of this year. The operation plan at that time was relatively simple and easy to implement. Based on the order situation and the principle that "the operation plan targets are higher than the state plan targets," they formulated the workshop's monthly operation plan, and then based on the monthly operation plan, they compiled a daily schedule, specifically stipulating the output and quality of each work section, each team, and each machine tool every day. At that time, they had not considered equipment maintenance, nor had they considered the equipment balance between the various processes. This was not because they intentionally did so, but because: on the one hand, they did not know where the weak links in the equipment were, and on the other hand, they did not know that the implementation of the operation plan was a central link in improving enterprise management and comprehensively improving production. They only knew that with a daily schedule, workers would have specific goals to strive for every day, thereby improving their concept of planning and ensuring the monthly completion of the state plan.

After several months of practice, they further realized that they should pay attention to the equipment balance of the processes. When summarizing the work every month and arranging the plans for the next month, they studied the weak links and organized forces to solve them. At the end of the first quarter, when the supply and sales personnel were afraid of late delivery and did not dare to boldly accept orders, resulting in insufficient tasks, they realized that the departments must formulate operation plans according to the production situation of the workshops. Because the equipment downtime was too long, they realized that they must formulate operation plans for the mechanical and electrical workshops and strengthen equipment maintenance. Especially in the second quarter, after seriously studying the articles on planning management in "Heavy Industry Communications," and after Comrade Feng Yi went to the Anshan Medium Steel Rolling Plant for a visit again, they clearly recognized that the preparation and implementation of the operation plan was the central link in implementing planning management and comprehensively improving production, and that strengthening the employees' concept of planning and overcoming weak links were only necessary conditions to ensure the realization of the operation plan. From late August of this year, they implemented shift operation plans and instruction charts in a step-by-step manner.

The biggest advantage of the New Shanghai Steel Factory's shift operation plan is that it is suitable for its own characteristics and is easily grasped by the masses. For example, the working conditions of the workers in the steel rolling workshop are poor, and they have to change shifts to rest every eleven or twenty minutes (different products have different small shift change times). The workers call this a small shift adjustment system. When preparing the shift operation plan, the workshop not only set out a plan for the large shift (eight hours), but also set out the output and quality plan for the small shift. In this way, every worker knows what to do and how much to do in eleven minutes (or twenty minutes). If the workers cannot complete the small shift plan, they will hold a meeting during the rest time to study and make up for it in the next small shift. In order to ensure the realization of the plan, they also implemented three systems while implementing the shift operation plan: the pre-shift meeting system, where the leader of the large shift announces the content of the operation plan and the precautions in operation; the post-shift meeting system, where they check the results of the plan implementation on that day, exchange experiences, and improve technology; and the scoring system, which serves as a basis for rewards, commendations, and criticisms. Those who are late, leave early, or violate operating procedures are deducted points, which has a great effect on consolidating labor discipline and implementing technical operating procedures.

Now, the New Shanghai Steel Factory has leaped to the ranks of advanced enterprises in East China. Since the beginning of this year, it has basically achieved the monthly completion or over-completion of the state's output, quality, and cost plans. The following figures can show the growth of production: If we set the total volume of various products last year as 100, then from January to August this year, cold-cast train wheels were 176, rolling mills were 172, horse iron was 180, and steel was 78. By the end of September, the factory had completed the state's annual output value plan; rolling mills had exceeded the state's annual plan by 19.8%, and screws had exceeded the state's annual plan by 1.6%. The quality of the six main products, such as cold-cast train wheels, all exceeded the state's planned targets. The cost was reduced by an average of 8% compared to the state's plan. The profits turned over have exceeded the annual plan by 23%.

IV. Establish and Consolidate a Strong Concept of Planning

It would be wrong to think that the process of the New Shanghai Steel Factory improving enterprise management through the implementation of the operation plan is simple. In order to make the operation plan a reality and gradually improve production, whether in terms of administrative management or the work of the Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League, relentless struggles were carried out.

When the horse iron workshop was experimenting with the implementation of the operation plan in December last year, the workers were discussing with great interest that our country would enter a planned economic construction, and knew that this construction would bring a bright future to the working class. However, many people did not know what position they should occupy in the construction, and did not know that they should support the construction by completing the state plan to accelerate the arrival of a bright future. Many employees were indifferent to the operation plan, thinking that "it can be completed, or it can not be completed," anyway, "if the plan is not completed every month, they can still receive wages, and even receive bonuses!" The workers in the teams looked out for themselves, and the cadres had a very serious tendency to only care about quantity and ignore quality. Therefore, the experimental implementation of the operation plan did not achieve the effect of improving production.

The Party and administrative leaders realized that if all employees did not have a strong concept of planning, they should not even think about realizing the operation plan.

The first thing they did was to summarize the production work in 1952. At the summary meeting, the only steel rolling workshop that exceeded the task was commended and awarded a red flag of "Glorious Workshop." At the same time, eleven workers who completed their personal plans or made special contributions to production were also commended and rewarded. The factory director and the leading cadres of the workshops who did not complete the task made public self-criticisms and criticized the idea of ignoring the plan. This was an unprecedented initiative in the history of the New Shanghai Steel Factory and the beginning of the factory's new life. Under the sharp contrast between commendation and criticism, employees began to regard the completion of the state plan as the standard for judging glory and shame. Workers said: "Now it's different: only completing the plan is truly glorious, and no matter how good it is, it's not glorious if the plan is not completed!"

They often used every opportunity to educate employees on the need to complete the state plan. For cadres above the workshop director and Party branch secretary, criticisms and self-criticisms were mainly carried out through one-hour study meetings every day and production inspection meetings once a week (previously once a month). For example, when they studied Comrade Malenkov's report at the 19th Congress of the CPSU in February, some people said: "The state plan is the law, which is suitable in the Soviet Union and in large factories in the Northeast and North China; but our factory is small, the tasks are uncertain, and the raw material supply is difficult. We can only fight passively. This concept is not suitable." They criticized this idea and established the idea that "no matter how big or small the factory is, the more difficulties there are, the more it needs to produce according to the plan."

The production inspection meeting is a regular meeting to comprehensively inspect the economic and political work of each workshop, and it is also a meeting to arrange new work. The cadres who participated in the meeting talked about their experiences, checked their ideological style, and criticized all kinds of ideas that ignored the plan. The cold casting workshop was commended for being the first to establish a technical research association, absorbing the collective wisdom of workers to solve the quality problems of cold-cast train wheels, and was criticized in early April for the cadres' complacency. The steel rolling workshop criticized the backwardness of the supply work. The mechanical and electrical workshop was criticized for failing to complete the maintenance according to the plan. The technical supervision section was blamed by each workshop for not being responsible enough in quality inspection. Comrade Wang Yusheng, the director of the horse iron workshop, was criticized the most. Because in the first quarter, he had a serious view of simply pursuing quantity, did not implement the engineer's and factory director's instructions on technical issues, and did not accept the workers' suggestions on improving quality. At the same time, due to his arrogance, the workshop cadres were not united, resulting in the quality of horse iron in the first quarter being 0.5% worse than the planned target, and as a result, the factory could not comprehensively complete the state plan. He was given a disciplinary warning within the Party and was criticized by all employees of the factory. The workers said: "We were originally all red (comprehensively completing the state plan), but you put a black spot on it!" This criticism left a very deep impression on the employees and became a source of strength for promoting people's progress. Comrade Wang Yusheng corrected his mistakes from then on and made a public self-criticism to the workers in the workshop. The workers regarded "0.5%" as the shame of the entire workshop, held meetings to check "the same thoughts as Director Wang"——the idea of ignoring quality, and resolved to win the red flag of excellence to wash it away. From May, mutual supervision and mutual assistance were implemented between teams. From then on, the workshop over-fulfilled the operation plan every month and was rated as the best workshop in the factory for completing the plan for four consecutive months.

The red flag competition and propaganda and mobilization work carried out by the trade union with the completion of the operation plan as the central content have become a powerful weapon for constantly improving the employees' concept of planning and ensuring the realization of the plan. The red flag competition is based on the workshop as a unit. Although there are inappropriate places (because it is a competition between different types of work, it is not easy to judge), it has cultivated a great collective heroism emotion among the employees. This emotion can make the workers in the workshop that won the red flag dedicate their wisdom to keeping the red flag flying in the workshop forever; it can also make the workers want to take the red flag from other workshops and overcome their own shortcomings. A mold-making worker in the horse iron workshop explained to me why they were able to fix the quality at more than 96%, and said this emotion. "Think about it!" he said: "The first to get the red flag was the cold casting workshop, then the screw workshop, and the steel rolling workshop. The red flag flew back and forth over our heads (the horse iron workshop is in the center of each workshop). How annoying, can't we take it back?"

Blackboard newspapers and radio stations often encourage the workers' enthusiasm for production. The radio station broadcasts the achievements of each workshop and team the day before when the workers are resting. Two workers in a wheel processing team in the cold casting workshop created a new quota of processing 31 wheels (the quota was 26 wheels). The radio station and blackboard newspaper spread their experience. The next day, they increased it to 37 wheels, and finally reached 40 wheels. On September 14, the radio station criticized the mold-making team in the horse iron workshop for ignoring quality, making the pass rate lower than the day before. The workers in this team conducted an inspection. The worker Lu Arong said: "That's right! We only paid attention to exceeding the quantity, and placed the molds too tightly, which hindered casting." The next day, they placed the molds more loosely. However, they were still not at ease and anxiously walked back and forth there after get off work until 9 pm, when they saw that there were no problems with the casting, they happily went home. These are just two very ordinary examples. The radio station and blackboard newspaper use commendation and criticism to make excellent people continue to progress and make people with mistakes improve their mistakes in time. That's why workers value it. Once, the radio station forgot to broadcast the new record of the workers in the screw workshop in time. The workers asked: "We are criticized if we don't complete the task. Now that we have created a new record, why doesn't the radio station sound?"

This year's wage reform has also played a certain role in consolidating the workers' enthusiasm for labor.

A new collective with the common goal of completing the operation plan has grown up. In the first quarter, 191 advanced workers appeared in the factory, and in June alone, 232 people appeared, and in July, it increased to 280 people. These constantly emerging advanced figures are the backbone of the new collective. They put forward a total of 146 rationalization proposals, improved the operating methods of steel rolling, annealing, etc., helped the factory overcome the difficulties encountered in the implementation of the operation plan, and increased a lot of money for the country.

V. Constantly Overcoming Weak Links

The experience of the New Shanghai Steel Factory also proves that in the implementation of the operation plan, administrative and technical management must promptly discover and overcome weak links (what the workers call "dead corners"), so as to continuously improve the level of production.

Promptly discovering and overcoming "dead corners" has special significance in the New Shanghai Steel Factory. The equipment imbalance and backward operating methods that have long existed have been concealed by the chaos in management. It is not easy for people to discover them when formulating the operation plan. Only when the operation plan is implemented, they are exposed one after another. Administrative and technical management must take measures in time to overcome them, so that the operation plan can be realized and the level of production can be continuously improved.

There are many such examples. When the operation plan was first implemented in January, the planner reported every day that the steel rolling workshop had not completed the daily progress stipulated in the operation plan. After the workshop leaders checked, they found that it was because the motor was heating up and the oil switch was tripping, causing too much non-operation time such as braking and stopping. The reason for the motor heating up was that the steel ingots were not heated evenly—some were permeable and some were not—and the cooperation between the steel rolling team and the furnace baking team was not good. The furnace baking team took out the steel ingots, but the steel rolling team did not roll them immediately, resulting in a decrease in temperature. They mobilized the workers to discuss. The workers proposed to improve the operating methods: the furnace baking workers added a shovel of coal to each steel ingot after it was clamped out to make the temperature uniform, and turned the steel ingots in the furnace several times to make them heated thoroughly and evenly; at the same time, the steel rolling team and the furnace baking team cooperated closely to eliminate the phenomenon of steel ingots waiting for steel rolling or steel rolling waiting for steel ingots. In this way, the number of cold steel ingots was reduced, the braking and stopping time was reduced by 15 minutes per hour, 15 more steel ingots were rolled, and from then on, the daily progress of the operation plan could be exceeded every day.

Another example is also from the steel rolling workshop. When this workshop rolled 9 cm round steel in May, the products were often deformed, with inconsistent thicknesses, and the pass rate did not reach the planned 95%. After the workers discussed, they found that the operating method of "slow rolling and fine making" was incorrect. It prolonged the rolling time, making the temperature of the steel ingot entering the rolling groove far from the temperature when it came out of the rolling groove, so the thickness of the product was uneven. At the same time, the rolling time was too long, and the temperature of the steel baking furnace was difficult to control, affecting the quality of the steel ingot when it came out of the furnace. Therefore, the "fast rolling" method was adopted, making the pass rate reach 99.73% and the output reach 166.8% of the operation plan.

The reason why the horse iron workshop can over-fulfill the plan every month is also the result of more timely overcoming the weakness of the annealing capacity. After the implementation of the operation plan in January, the output of mold making and casting increased, but the capacity of the annealing kiln was almost only half of that of mold making. Semi-finished products were piled up like mountains in the annealing team. Later, engineers and workers combined to create a rapid annealing method of "quick heating and cooling, hot in and out, and smooth loading," overcoming the imbalance between work sections.

Now, each workshop has established a technical research group, composed of technicians and experienced workers, and is working under the leadership of the chief engineer.

VI. Implementing the Shift Operation Plan Can Complete the Task of Increasing Production and Practicing Economy

When the workers were enthusiastically discussing how to ensure the implementation of the shift operation plan to further improve the level of management, the People's Daily editorial on September 6 on increasing production and practicing economy spread in the factory. From inside the Party to outside the Party, from leading cadres to employees, the Party's instructions on carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy were combined with the central task of implementing the shift operation plan for discussion.

They analyzed the current production situation and believed that since the implementation of the operation plan, although management and production have been greatly improved, the potential is still great. The employee representative meeting of the whole factory on September 24 put forward the goal of struggling to increase production and practice economy by 30.2 billion yuan for the country.

Where is the potential? The factory director told me that in the steel rolling workshop, the main points are: 1. Strengthen equipment maintenance and reduce downtime. Since the implementation of the shift operation plan on August 28, the output and quality have been improved compared with before, but due to the poor maintenance of the equipment, each shift actually only drives for seven hours, sometimes less than seven hours. After doing a good job in equipment maintenance, the operation time can be increased by one hour every day; 2. Transform the first rolling machine, change the original two rolling rolls to three rolling rolls, which can also increase output and reduce workers' labor intensity.

The main task of the cold casting workshop is to improve quality. Although the pass rate of train wheels has exceeded the state's planned target, the average is only 77.7%. The reasons, in addition to the substandard pig iron, are mainly the shortcomings in operating methods. Now we are concentrating our efforts on studying the ingredient problems and improving the operating methods. The problem of rolling mills is not big. The large rolling mills that could not be made before have been successfully tested on September 8.

The main task of the horse iron workshop is to balance the equipment capacity of the processes. Now the ratio of mold making, annealing, and machining capacity is 100:90:30. On the one hand, most of the products are processed outside the factory, and on the other hand, the equipment in the factory is not fully utilized——the machine tools in the screw workshop are idle, and the machine tools in the horse iron workshop have at least 20% of the capacity that has not been utilized.

Since the screw workshop does not produce evenly by the hour, there is at least half an hour of downtime per shift. As long as the downtime is reduced, 181 tons can be increased.

The factory director said that in carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy, they solved the above problems and put the potential that was tapped into the shift operation plan. Therefore, as long as the shift operation plan is fully implemented, the plan to increase production and practice economy can be over-fulfilled. Facts have proved the correctness of this policy. The steel rolling workshop has improved production by 20% since the full implementation of the shift operation plan on September 3; the mold-making section of the horse iron workshop has improved production by about 40% after the implementation of the shift operation plan. Each workshop is taking specific measures to ensure the realization of the shift operation plan. For example, the steel rolling workshop is formulating an equipment maintenance system and preparing to carry out a labor competition centered on implementing the equipment maintenance system in the entire workshop in order to further consolidate and improve the achievements that have been made in the implementation of the shift operation plan. The horse iron workshop has criticized the complacency of the machining section and prepared conditions for the implementation of the shift operation plan.

The employees of the New Shanghai Steel Factory are not satisfied with the current achievements. They adhere to the policy of "improving the targets every month." Therefore, we believe that in the movement to increase production and practice economy, they will take a step forward on the basis of the present.

    新沪钢铁厂的转变
    陆超祺
    一、在困难的日子里
    新沪钢铁厂是解放以后由几个小厂合并起来的，现在有四个在生产上互不联系的生产车间——轧钢、冷铸、马铁、螺钉车间，制造六种主要产品——钢材、火车轮、轧辊、马铁、螺钉和螺帽。设备和建筑都很陈旧，相当多的生产过程都是手工操作。
    今年一月以前，这个工厂经常完不成国家计划。在去年，六种主要产品，只有钢材超额完成了产量和质量指标，其余的只完成产量指标的百分之五十二至八十四，而质量合格率只达百分之五十到七十。然而人们对这种情况却心安理得。全厂从上到下，大都错误地认为：“国家计划可以完成，也可以不完成。”工人之间不仅是各顾各，而且许多工人都不大遵守劳动纪律，该是开始工作的时候了，才慢吞吞地走进车间里来，换衣服，找工具，找材料……，半点钟、一点钟白白过去了；在没下班的时候，有些人就去换衣服、洗澡。
    混乱状况也表现在其它方面。供销单位不根据生产情况接受订货。因脱期交货而被罚款的事件是很多的，这原因不尽是供销部门接受订货时不考虑生产情况，也还在于生产管理方面没有制度，没有计划。有几家国营工厂订制两百个轧辊。技术人员绘了图样，工人们辛辛苦苦地制了模型，浇了铁水，进行了清理，但是没有加工——最后一道工序——就把它们扔到一边去。以后再没有人过问，等到订货单位来提货的时候，大家才慌乱起来，才赶紧加工。职工因加工加点而受累，工厂因脱期交货而被罚款。又如上海铁路管理局定制铁路上用的内外卡子各一千五百套（每套四只），合同上明明写着十糎的，但做的统统是十一糎的。铁路局来提货了，一看不对，怎样办呢？修改吧！匆匆修改的结果，几乎是前功尽弃——六千只外卡坏了五千三百只，六千只内卡坏了四千只！
    过多的罚款、积压和废品，把流动资金统统搞光了。上缴利润没钱交，工资发不出去，马铁车间要几万元买一个砂轮也拿不出来。财务科长被人称为“穷鬼”。工厂的处境像一家宣布破产的银行一样。国家银行冻结了该厂的资金，宣布它开的票据一概无效。罚款纠纷纷至沓来，有时还被人家控告到法院里去。订户对它失去了信用，不敢再来订货；已经签订订货合同的，有的也要求停止执行。领导机关曾一度命令该厂的一个主要车间停止生产！
    二、感受最深的
    去年秋天，中共中央华东局工业部组织一个参观团，去东北学习贯彻技术操作规程，以改进产品质量的经验。新沪钢铁厂厂长对于这次参观寄以极大的希望。他认为那时工厂的致命缺点是质量问题，因此，如果从东北学到一套改进产品质量的经验的话，那也许能把工厂从狼狈状态中拯救出来。
    俗话说得好：“不怕不识货，只怕货比货。”当该厂厂长走进鞍山钢铁公司，走进抚顺和大连的先进工厂，并且与那里的干部和工人接触以后，眼睛明亮起来了，锐利起来了。他从别人的优点中看出了自己的缺点。
    那里的确有值得学习的改进产品质量的经验。但是，使人感受最深刻的还不是质量问题，而是作为一个工人，一个共产党员，尤其是一个企业的领导人，应该怎样对待国家计划。
    他们不论与什么人谈什么问题，只要是与生产有关的，人们总是自豪地从计划讲起，不只讲数目字，还要讲用什么办法去完成它。人们把计划看作是神圣的，不能不完成的，把它看作是行动的纲领，看作是职工奋斗的目标。“可是，在我们工厂又是怎样的呢？”新沪钢铁厂厂长每一次都这样问自己，并且自己又答道：“恰恰相反。我们领导干部认为订计划是应付上级，职工认为计划是‘天书’——完不成的。我们认为国家计划完成可以，不完成也可以！”
    “要是我们厂的职工也有这样坚强的计划观念就好了！”
    一种越来越强烈的要求改善企业管理的渴望占有了他，他们在学习改进产品质量的经验以后，特地用三天时间去大连钢厂学习编制车间作业计划。
    三、紧紧抓住作业计划
    厂长去年十一月末回到工厂以后，在党委的领导下，利用一切会议及机会，向干部讲他在东北所看到的，所感受到的，以及领导上的决心——通过贯彻作业计划改进生产。他要求不要等待，立即就干。那时厂里没有人懂得作业计划是怎样回事，他就亲自帮助马铁车间做出榜样来给大家看。
    在全厂四个生产车间推行作业计划，是从今年一月开始的。当时的作业计划是比较简单易行的。他们根据订货情况以及“作业计划指标高于国家计划指标”的原则制订车间的月度作业计划，然后又根据月作业计划编日历进度表，具体规定每一工段、每一小组、每一机床每天的产量和质量。他们当时还没有考虑设备检修，也没有考虑各个工序间的设备平衡。这并不是他们有意这样做，而是因为：一方面不了解设备上薄弱的环节在哪里，另一方面还不知道推行作业计划是改善企业管理，全面提高生产的中心环节。他们只知道：有了日历进度表，工人每天就有具体的奋斗目标，从而可以提高计划观念，保证逐月完成国家计划。
    经过了几个月的实践，他们进一步知道了要注意工序的设备平衡，在每月总结工作，布置下月份的计划时，研究了薄弱环节，并且组织力量解决它。在第一季度末，由于供销人员怕脱期交货，不敢大胆接受订货而造成任务不足时，他们又认识到科室必须根据车间的生产情况订作业计划。由于设备停修的时间太多，他们才认识了必须制订机电车间的作业计划，加强设备维护工作。特别是在第二季度，认真学习了“重工业通讯”上有关计划管理的文章，以及冯毅同志再度去鞍钢中型轧钢厂参观回来后，才明确认识了编制与贯彻作业计划是实行计划管理、全面提高生产的中心环节，而加强职工的计划观念及克服薄弱环节，只是保证作业计划实现的必要条件。从今年八月下旬起，他们又有步骤地推行了轮班作业计划和指示图表。
    新沪钢铁厂的轮班作业计划的最大优点，就是适合于他们自己的特点，容易被群众所掌握。譬如轧钢车间工人的劳动条件不好，每隔十一分钟或二十分钟（不同的产品有不同的小换班时间）就得换一次班休息。工人称这为小调班制。车间在编制轮班作业计划时，除了订出一个大班（八小时）的计划外，还要订出小班的产量质量计划。这样，每一个工人，都知道在十一分钟（或者二十分钟）内做什么，做多少。如果工人们不能完成小班的计划，在休息的时候就开会研究，在下一次小班时就弥补起来。为了保证计划的实现，他们在贯彻轮班作业计划的同时，还实行了三种制度：班前会议制度，由大班班长宣布作业计划内容及操作上应注意事项；班后会议制度，检查当天的计划执行结果，交流经验，提高技术；评分制度，作为奖励、表扬和批评的依据，凡有迟到、早退或违犯操作规程的，都被扣分，这对于巩固劳动纪律和贯彻技术操作规程有很大的作用。
    现在，新沪钢铁厂已经跃进到华东地区的先进企业的行列了。今年以来，它基本上做到了逐月完成或超额完成国家产量、质量和成本计划。下面的数字可以表明生产的增长：如果我们把去年各种产品的总量定为一○○，那末今年一至八月，冷铸火车轮为一七六，轧辊为一七二，马铁为一八○，钢材为七八。到九月末全厂已经完成了国家全年的产值计划；轧辊已经超额百分之十九点八完成了国家全年计划，螺钉超额百分之一点六完成国家全年计划。冷铸火车轮等六种主要产品的质量都超过了国家计划指标。成本平均比国家计划降低百分之八。上缴利润已超过全年计划百分之二十三。
    四、建立和巩固坚强的计划观念
    如果认为新沪钢铁厂通过推行作业计划改进企业管理的过程很简单，那是错误的。为了使作业计划能够实现并逐步提高生产，不论是行政管理方面，或者是党、工会和青年团的工作，都进行了不屈不挠的斗争。
    去年十二月份在马铁车间试验推行作业计划时，工人们正以极大的兴趣谈论着我们国家将进入有计划的经济建设，并知道这个建设将给工人阶级带来美好的未来。但是，很多人却不知道自己在建设中应占着什么地位，不知道自己应以完成国家计划来支援建设，以加速美好的未来的来临。很多职工对作业计划漠不关心，认为“完成可以，不完成也可以”，反正“每月完不成计划同样可以领到工资，甚至可以领到奖金！”小组里的工人各顾各，而干部又有极严重的只顾数量忽视质量的倾向，所以，试验推行作业计划并没有收到改进生产的效果。
    党和行政的领导同志认识到：如果全体职工没有坚强的计划观念，那就休想实现作业计划。
    他们最先做的是总结一九五二年的生产工作。在总结大会上，表扬了唯一超额完成任务的轧钢车间，并奖给它一面“光荣车间”的红旗。同时也表扬和奖励了完成个人计划或在生产中有特殊贡献的十一位工人。厂长和没有完成任务的车间领导干部都做了公开的检讨，批判忽视计划的思想。这是新沪钢铁厂有史以来的创举，是工厂新生的开端。在表扬与批评的鲜明对照下，职工开始以完成国家计划作为判断光荣与耻辱的标准。工人说：“现在可不同了：只有完成计划才真光荣，完不成计划再好也不光荣！”
    他们经常利用每一个机会对职工进行必须完成国家计划的教育。对车间主任和党支部书记以上的干部，主要是通过每天一小时的学习会和每周一次（以前是每月一次）生产检查会议开展批评和自我批评。譬如他们在二月间学习马林科夫同志在联共第十九次代表大会上的报告时，有些人说：“国家计划就是法律，在苏联，在东北和华北的大厂子是适合的；但是我们厂子小，任务不定，原料供应有困难，只能打被动仗，这个观念是不适合的。”他们就批判这种思想，树立“不论大厂小厂，越是有困难就越需要按计划生产”的思想。
    生产检查会是定期全面检查各车间经济工作、政治工作的会议，也是布置新的工作的会议。参加会议的干部谈自己的经验，检查自己的思想作风，批评各色各样忽视计划的思想。冷铸车间曾因最先成立技术研究会，吸收工人集体智慧解决冷铸火车轮的质量问题而受到了表扬，四月初因干部滋长自满情绪而受到批评。轧钢车间批评供应工作落后。机电车间因不能按计划完成检修而受到批评。技术监督科在质量检查中不够负责受到各车间的责备。马铁车间主任王玉生同志被批评最多。因为在第一季度里，他存在着严重的单纯追求数量观点，不执行工程师、厂长关于技术问题的指示，不接受工人提出的提高质量的建议，同时由于他的自高自大，车间干部不团结，造成第一季度马铁的质量比计划指标差百分之○点五，并因此使工厂不能全面完成国家计划。他受到党内处分，并受到全厂职工的批评。工人们说：“我们本来是满堂红（全面完成国家计划）的，而你却在上面弄上了一个黑点！”这个批评在职工中留下极深刻的影响，成为推动人们前进的力量的源泉。王玉生同志从此改正了自己的错误，向车间工人作公开的检讨。工人把“百分之○点五”当作全车间的耻辱，开会检查“和王主任一样的思想”——忽视质量思想，决心以争取优胜红旗来洗刷它。从五月份起，小组与小组间实行互相监督，互相帮助。从此，该车间月月超额完成作业计划，并且一连四个月都被评为全厂完成计划的最好车间。
    工会以完成作业计划为中心内容而开展的红旗竞赛和宣传鼓动工作，已成为不断地提高职工的计划观念，保证计划实现的有力武器。红旗竞赛是以车间为单位的，虽然有不妥当的地方（因为是不同工种的竞赛，不好评判），但它却在职工中培养了一种伟大的集体英雄主义感情。这种感情可以使获得红旗的车间工人，为把红旗永远飘扬在车间里而献出自己的智慧；也可以使工人们想从别的车间里把红旗夺过来而克服自己的缺点。马铁车间的一位制模工人向我说明为什么他们能把质量固定在百分之九十六以上时，曾说出了这种感情。“你想想看吧！”他说：“首先得红旗的是冷铸车间，以后是螺钉车间，是轧钢车间，红旗从我们头上飞来飞去（马铁车间在各车间的中央），多么气人，难道我们就不能把它夺过来吗？”
    黑板报和广播台经常鼓舞着工人们的生产热情。广播台每天在工人休息的时候，广播前一天各车间、小组的成绩。冷铸车间有一班车轮加工组的两个工人创造了加工三十一只（定额为二十六只）新定额，广播台和黑板报把他们的经验传布开了，次日，他们又提高到三十七只，最后达到四十只。九月十四日，广播台批评马铁车间制模小组忽视质量，使合格率比前一天低了。这个小组的工人就进行检查。工人陆阿荣说：“可不是吗！我们只注意在数量上超额，把模子摆得太挤了，妨碍了浇铸。”第二天，他们就把模子摆得松些。但是，他们还不放心，下班后仍然焦急地在那里走来走去，一直等到晚上九点，亲眼看到浇铸没有问题后，才高高兴兴地回家。这只不过是两个极普通的例子。广播台和黑板报就是通过表扬和批评，使优秀的人继续前进，使有错误的人及时改进错误。正因为这样，工人才重视它。有一次，广播台忘记及时地广播螺钉车间工人的新纪录，工人们就问：“我们完不成任务就挨批评，现在创造了新纪录，广播台为什么就不响啦？”
    今年的工资改革，对巩固工人的劳动热忱也起了一定的作用。
    一个以完成作业计划为共同奋斗目标的新集体已经成长起来。在第一季度，全厂出现了一百九十一名先进工作者，而六月一个月就出现了二百三十二人，七月份又增加到二百八十人。这些不断地涌现出来的先进人物，就是新集体的骨干。他们一共提出了一百四十六条合理化建议，改进了轧钢、焖火等操作方法，帮助工厂克服在推行作业计划中遇到的困难，给国家增加了很多钱。
    五、不断克服薄弱环节
    新沪钢铁厂的经验，也证明了在执行作业计划中，行政和技术管理方面要及时地发现与克服薄弱环节（工人们称之为“死角”），这才能不断地提高生产水平了。
    及时地发现及克服“死角”，在新沪钢铁厂有着特殊的意义。长期就存在着的设备的不平衡和操作方法的落后，被管理上的混乱掩盖起来了。人们在制订作业计划时还不容易发现它们，只是到了贯彻作业计划时，它们才陆陆续续地暴露出来。行政管理和技术管理方面，必须及时采取措施克服它们，作业计划才能实现，生产水平才得以不断地提高。
    有许多这类的例子。一月份刚刚实行作业计划时，计划员每天汇报说：轧钢车间没有完成作业计划所规定的日进度。车间领导同志检查以后，发现是由于马达发热油开关跳动，造成刹车、停车等非作业时间太多。而造成马达发热的原因，是钢锭烧得不匀——有的透了，有的没透——和轧钢组烘炉组配合得不好，烘炉组把钢锭拿出来后轧钢组没有马上轧，结果温度减低了。他们发动工人讨论。工人提出要改进操作方法：烧炉工人在每根钢锭钳出来后加一锹煤，使温度均匀，并把炉内钢锭多翻几次，使它烧得透且匀；同时轧钢组与烘炉组密切配合，消灭钢锭等轧钢或轧钢等钢锭的脱节现象。这样，冷钢锭减少了，每小时减少了十五分钟的刹车、停车时间，多轧了十五根钢锭，从此便每日都能超额完成作业计划的日进度。
    还有一个例子也是轧钢车间的。这个车间在五月份轧九糎元钢时，产品经常变形，粗细不一，合格率没有达到计划规定的百分之九十五。工人讨论后，发现是“慢轧细做”的操作法不对，它延长了轧制时间，使钢锭进入轧槽时的温度与从轧槽出来时的温度相差太远，所以产品粗细不匀。同时，轧制时间太长，烘钢炉的温度不好控制，影响钢锭出炉时的质量。于是采取“快速轧制”法，使合格率达到百分之九十九点七三，产量达到作业计划的百分之一百六十六点八。
    马铁车间所以能月月超额完成计划，也是比较及时地克服焖火能力薄弱的结果。一月份实行作业计划后，制模、浇铸的产量都提高了，但焖火窑的能力几乎只有制模的一半。半成品在焖火组堆积如山。后来，工程师和工人结合，创造了“快烧速冷，热进热出，顺装多装”的快速焖火法，克服了工段之间的不平衡。
    现在，各个车间已成立技术研究组，由技术员和有经验的工人组成，在总工程师的领导下进行工作。
    六、推行轮班作业计划就能完成增产节约任务
    正在工人们热烈讨论怎样保证贯彻轮班作业计划，以进一步提高管理水平的时候，人民日报九月六日的关于增产节约的社论在工厂里传开了。从党内到党外，从领导干部到职工，都把党关于开展增产节约运动的指示结合着贯彻轮班作业计划的中心工作一起加以讨论。
    他们分析了目前生产的情况，认为自从推行作业计划以来，虽在管理方面和生产方面都大大提高了，但是潜在能力还是很大的。九月二十四日全厂职工代表会议提出为国家增产节约三百零二亿元的奋斗目标。
    潜力在那里？厂长告诉我说，在轧钢车间，主要是：一、加强设备维护，减少停车时间。自从八月二十八日开始推行轮班作业计划以后，产量、质量都比以前提高了，但是由于设备维护得不好，每班实际上只开车七小时，有时候还不到七小时，搞好设备维护以后，每天就可以增加一小时的作业时间；二、改造头道车，把原有的二个轧辊改为三个轧辊，也可以提高产量，并减轻工人劳动强度。
    冷铸车间主要是提高质量。火车轮的合格率虽然超过了国家计划指标，但平均只达到了百分之七十七点七。其原因除生铁不合规格外，主要是操作方法有缺点。现在正集中力量研究配料问题，研究改进操作方法问题。轧辊的问题不大，以前不能做的大轧辊，在九月八日已经试做成功了。
    马铁车间主要是平衡工序设备能力。现在制模、焖火和机械加工能力的比例是一百比九十比三十。一方面，大部分产品靠厂外加工，另一方面厂里的设备没有充分利用——螺钉车间的机床闲着，马铁车间的机床至少还有百分之二十的能力没有发挥。
    螺钉车间由于没有按小时均衡生产，每班至少有半小时的停车时间，只要减少停车时间，就可以增产一百八十一吨。
    厂长说，他们在开展增产节约运动中，解决上面这些问题，把挖掘出来的潜在能力订到轮班作业计划里去，所以，只要全面推行轮班作业计划，就能超额完成增产节约计划。事实已证明这个方针的正确。轧钢车间自九月三日全面推行轮班作业计划后，生产提高了百分之二十；马铁车间制模工段推行轮班作业计划后，生产提高了百分之四十左右。各车间正在采取具体措施保证轮班作业计划的实现。譬如，轧钢车间正在制订设备维护制度，准备在全车间开展一个以贯彻设备维护制度为中心内容的劳动竞赛，以便进一步巩固与提高推行轮班作业计划已取得的成绩。马铁车间已经批判了加工工段的自满情绪，为推行轮班作业计划准备了条件。
    新沪钢铁厂的职工并不满足于现在的成绩，他们坚持着“逐月提高指标”的方针。因此，我们相信他们在增产节约运动中，将在现在的基础上提高一步。
