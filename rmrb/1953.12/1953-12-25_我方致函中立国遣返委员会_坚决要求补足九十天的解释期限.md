Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 24th: Due to the U.S. side's deliberate delay in constructing the explanation facilities and its direction of special agents to repeatedly and for long periods interrupt the explanations, the Korean-Chinese side's explanation work had only been conducted for ten days by December 23rd. Fewer than one-seventh of the total number of Korean-Chinese prisoners of war had the opportunity to hear the explanations. Under these circumstances, the U.S. side has recently been unreasonably clamoring that the ninety-day period stipulated by the "Terms of Reference" for providing explanations to all non-directly repatriated prisoners of war must end on December 23rd.

    The Korean-Chinese side sent a letter to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on the evening of December 23rd, firmly demanding that the explanation work must continue in order to make up for the full ninety-day explanation period. The Korean-Chinese side pointed out: "The entire spirit of the 'Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission' is to ensure that the side to which the prisoners of war belong has the freedom and convenience to conduct explanations to the prisoners of war for ninety days, thereby guaranteeing the prisoners of war the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated. To this end, Article 8 of the 'Terms of Reference' explicitly stipulates that after the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission takes over all prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to repatriation, it shall immediately make arrangements so that the country to which the prisoners of war belong has the freedom and convenience to conduct explanations to the prisoners of war within ninety days from the date of takeover by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. If the above spirit and specific provisions of the 'Terms of Reference' could be truly implemented, the explanation work should have started on September 25, 1953, the date the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission took over the prisoners of war, and continued uninterrupted until December 23, 1953, thereby guaranteeing the ninety-day explanation period. But in fact, since the transfer of prisoners of war, the U.S. side has delayed the construction of explanation facilities, causing the explanation work that should have started on September 25th to be postponed to October 15th. In its initial stage, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission also advocated that the loss of explanation days should be extended, but after the United Nations Command side systematically deprived the Korean-Chinese side of twenty explanation days, it did not continue to advocate making up for them, which allowed the United Nations Command side to dare to further instruct special agents to obstruct the explanations. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, in turn, did not resolutely stop the obstructive activities of the special agents in accordance with the provisions of the 'Terms of Reference,' resulting in the Korean-Chinese side's explanation work being suspended continuously for as many as five times, depriving the Korean-Chinese side of sixty explanation days. The Korean-Chinese side's explanation work has only been conducted for ten days by December 23rd. The basic spirit and provisions of the 'Terms of Reference' have not been realized at all."

    The Korean-Chinese side further pointed out in its letter to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission: The continuous suspension of explanation work is due to the U.S. side instructing special agents not to allow prisoners of war to listen to the explanations, and due to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission basically adopting a wait-and-see attitude, anticipating the obstruction of the special agents, and decisively notifying the Korean-Chinese side to stop the explanations. Taking the fourth and fifth suspensions of explanations as examples, although the commission had an inescapable responsibility according to the "Terms of Reference" and "Rules of Procedure" to provide isolation facilities to allow our side's explanation work to resume, the commission overturned its promise of November 6th and refused to provide isolation tents. Even after the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission finally provided isolation tents on December 10th, the commission still emphasized that special agents were not allowed to isolate prisoners of war, making it impossible for the Korean-Chinese side's explanation work to proceed. Because the Korean-Chinese side argued on the basis of reason, the prisoners of war were finally isolated on December 21st, and the explanation work was thus restored, which also proved that the so-called claim that the commission could not take action because the special agents refused to isolate and listen to the explanations was simply not true. If the commission had resolutely stopped the obstructive activities of the special agents in accordance with the provisions of the "Terms of Reference," the Korean-Chinese side's explanation days could have been saved from being lost. Therefore, although the major losses suffered by the Korean-Chinese side's explanation days should be borne primarily by the United Nations Command side, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's failure to resolutely implement the "Terms of Reference," which led to this loss, cannot but bear direct responsibility.

    The Korean-Chinese side firmly demands to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to continue the explanation work and make up for the ninety-day explanation period. The Korean-Chinese side also requests the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to provide a reply.

### 我方致函中立国遣返委员会  坚决要求补足九十天的解释期限

    我方致函中立国遣返委员会
    坚决要求补足九十天的解释期限
    【新华社开城二十四日电】由于美方故意拖延解释设备的修建，并指挥其特务屡次长期中断解释，朝中方面的解释工作迄至十二月二十三日止仅进行了十天，有机会听取解释的朝中被俘人员尚不及总数的七分之一。在这种情况下，美方近来竟无理叫嚣，要求“职权范围”所规定的应向一切不直接遣返的战俘进行解释的九十天期限必须于十二月二十三日终止。
    朝中方面已于十二月二十三日晚致函中立国遣返委员会，坚决要求解释工作必须继续进行，以补足九十天的解释期限。朝中方面指出：“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的整个精神，在于保证战俘所属一方有自由与便利向战俘进行九十天的解释，从而保证战俘有机会行使其被遣返的权利。为此，
  “职权范围”第八款明确规定，中立国遣返委员会在接管全部未行使其遣返权利的战俘之后，应立即进行安排，使战俘所属国家有自由与便利在自中立国遣返委员会接管之日起的九十天内，向战俘进行解释。如果“职权范围”的上述精神和具体条款能够真正实施，则解释工作应该在一九五三年九月二十五日，即中立国遣返委员会接管战俘之日开始，并自此不断进行到一九五三年十二月二十三日，从而保证九十天的解释期限。但事实上美方自移交战俘后，即拖延修建解释设备，使本应在九月二十五日开始的解释工作推迟到十月十五日。中立国遣返委员会在其初期也曾主张解释日期的损失应予顺延，但在联合国军方面有计划地剥夺了朝中方面二十个解释日期后，却并未继续主张加以补足，这就使联合国军方面敢于进一步指使特务阻挠解释，而中立国遣返委员会又未根据“职权范围”的规定坚决制止特务的阻挠活动，以致朝中方面的解释工作连续停顿达五次之多，剥夺了朝中方面六十个解释日期。朝中方面的解释工作到十二月二十三日为止仅仅进行了十天，“职权范围”的基本精神与条款根本未能实现。
    朝中方面在给中立国遣返委员会的信中进一步指出：解释工作的连续停顿，其原因是由于美方指使特务不让战俘听取解释，并由于中立国遣返委员会基本上采取了坐视态度，预期特务的阻挠，而断然通知朝中方面停止解释。即以第四、第五两次解释停顿的情况来说，尽管委员会根据“职权范围”和“工作细则”有无可逃避的责任，提供隔离设备来使我方解释工作得以恢复，但委员会却推翻其十一月六日的诺言，不肯提供隔离帐篷。即在中立国遣返委员会在十二月十日终于提供了隔离帐篷后，委员会仍然强调特务不许战俘隔离，使朝中方面解释工作无从进行。由于朝中方面据理力争，十二月二十一日战俘终被隔离，解释工作因之恢复，从而也就证明了所谓由于特务拒绝隔离和听取解释，因之委员会不能有所行动的说法，根本不是事实。而如果委员会根据“职权范围”的规定坚决制止特务的阻挠活动，则朝中方面解释日期原是可以不致遭受损失的。因此朝中方面解释日期所遭受的重大损失，虽然应由联合国军方面负其主要责任，但中立国遣返委员会由于未能坚决实施“职权范围”而引致了这种损失，也是不能不负有直接责任的。
    朝中方面向中立国遣返委员会坚决要求继续进行解释工作，补足九十天的解释期限。朝中方面并要求中立国遣返委员会给予答复。
