    The members of the China-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm in Changzhi County, Shanxi Province, the New Life Collective Farm in Nenjiang County, Heilongjiang Province, the Tuanshanzi Collective Farm in Ning'an County, Songjiang Province, and the May 1st Collective Farm in Chengde County, Rehe Province, actively sold surplus grain to support the Party's general line for the transition period with practical actions. These four collective farms sold a total of more than 1.83 million jin of surplus grain to the state.
    This year, the grain yields of the China-Soviet Friendship and other collective farms were all higher than those of farmers outside the farms. The China-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm's grain yield per mu exceeded that of the best mutual aid teams in the area by 25.7 percent and that of individual farmers by 43.4 percent. The wheat yield of the New Life Collective Farm was more than 50 percent higher than that of local mutual aid teams. Although autumn grains such as soybeans, corn, and millet were affected by natural disasters, their yields were also 20 to 30 percent higher than those of surrounding mutual aid teams. The yield of grain and cotton per mu of the May 1st Collective Farm was 100 to 200 jin higher than that of farmers outside the farm.
    When studying and discussing the Party's general line for the transition period, the members of these four collective farms deeply realized the importance of agricultural collectivization and national industrialization based on the benefits of collective farm production and the beginning of the use of mechanized farming. Liang Xigui, a member of the China-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm, calculated the benefits of national industrial development for farmers. He said, "Our farm's 'Nachi' tractor can cultivate 230 mu of land a day to a depth of six or seven inches, which is equivalent to the work of ninety-two people, ninety-two head of livestock, and forty-six plows a day. We should actively support the state's development of industry so that the state can build more agricultural machinery for us sooner." Meng Xianzchen, a member of the Tuanshanzi Collective Farm, said, "Our farm had a bumper harvest last year. Although we suffered a disaster this year, our harvest was still better than that of farmers outside the farm. If it weren't for the strength of the collective, the dozen or so hectares of corn next to the wheat fields that were infested with pests this year would not have been saved. Collectivization is the bright road for us farmers! With agricultural collectivization and national industrialization, we can supply our farmers with a large number of machines for farming, and we will surely have a better life." In order to support national industrialization, the members all believed that they should actively sell their surplus grain to the state. Li Yongxiao, chairman of the May 1st Collective Farm, said, "The state has control of the grain, and the development of industry will be faster. In the future, we can have a large number of machines to farm the land. We, the farmers who collectivized first, must sell more grain and be pioneers in supporting national construction." The 222 members of the May 1st Collective Farm each cultivate about the same amount of land as the farmers outside the farm. However, in addition to the 90,000 jin of cotton that the farm will gradually sell to the state, each household sells an average of 150 jin more grain to the state than each household outside the farm. Farmers outside the farm all admired and said: Collective farmers are stronger and more energetic and make greater contributions to the country.
    The China-Soviet Friendship, New Life, Tuanshanzi, and May 1st collective farms sold more than 1.02 million jin, 360,000 jin, 340,000 jin, and 110,000 jin of surplus grain to the state, respectively. The money obtained from the sale of grain is planned to be used for production in a planned way. The China-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm plans to buy 250,000 jin of soybean cake and 50,000 jin of fertilizer, and the rest will be deposited in the National Bank. The management committee of the May 1st Collective Farm initially plans to use the proceeds from the sale of grain to invest in winter sideline production and to prepare for the opening of another 200 mu of paddy fields next year.

    中苏友好等四个集体农庄
    卖给国家一百八十三万多斤余粮
    山西省长治县中苏友好集体农庄、黑龙江省嫩江县新生集体农庄、松江省宁安县团山子集体农庄和热河省承德县五一集体农庄的庄员们，积极出售余粮，以实际行动拥护国家过渡时期的总路线。这四个集体农庄共卖给国家一百八十三万多斤余粮。
    今年中苏友好等集体农庄的粮食产量都高于庄外农民。中苏友好集体农庄每亩地产粮数量超过当地最好的互助组百分之二十五点七，超过单干农民百分之四十三点四。新生集体农庄小麦产量比当地互助组高百分之五十以上，大豆、玉米、谷子等秋粮曾受到自然灾害的侵袭，产量也比周围互助组高百分之二十到三十。五一集体农庄粮食、棉花每亩的产量都比庄外农民高出一、二百斤。
    这四个集体农庄的庄员们在学习和讨论国家过渡时期总路线的时候，根据农庄集体生产和开始使用机械耕作得到的好处，深刻认识到农业集体化和国家工业化的重要性。中苏友好集体农庄庄员梁喜贵把国家发展工业对农民的好处算了一笔账，他说：“我们农庄一辆‘纳奇号’拖拉机一天能耕二百三十亩土地，耕到六、七寸深，顶九十二个人、九十二头牲口、四十六付犁一天干的活。咱们应该积极支持国家发展工业，让国家早给咱们多造些农业机械。”团山子集体农庄庄员孟宪臣说：“咱们农庄去年大丰收。今年虽然受灾收成也比庄外农民强。要不是集体的力量，今年紧挨麦地的十几垧发生虫害的玉米，说啥也救不过来。集体化就是咱们农民的光明大道！农业集体化了，再加上国家工业化，能供给我们农民大量种地的机器，咱们准保能过更好的日子。”为了支持国家工业化，庄员们都认为应该积极把余粮卖给国家。五一集体农庄主席李永孝说：“国家掌握了粮食，发展工业就更快，将来咱们就可以有大量机器种地。咱们先集体化了的农民一定要卖更多的粮食，做支援国家建设的先锋。”五一集体农庄二百二十二户庄员，每户平均耕作的土地和当地庄外农民相仿，可是农庄除了将要把九万斤棉花陆续卖给国家外，平均每户卖给国家的粮食比庄外农民每户多一百五十斤。庄外农民都佩服地说：还是集体农民腰粗气力足，对国家贡献大。
    中苏友好、新生、团山子和五一这四个集体农庄分别卖给国家余粮一百零二万多斤、三十六万斤、三十四万斤和十一万斤。卖粮得到的钱，都准备有计划地用来投入生产。中苏友好集体农庄计划买二十五万斤豆饼、五万斤肥田粉，其余大部都存入国家银行。五一集体农庄管理委员会初步计划把卖粮款除投入冬季副业生产外，并用来为明年再开二百亩稻田作好准备。
