Editorial:

    The World Peace Council meeting in Vienna has concluded successfully. The meeting, in light of the current international situation, adopted important resolutions calling on the people of all countries to take vigorous action to promote international consultation and the realization of agreements, and suggested preparing an international conference to discuss the issue of easing international tensions. The significant achievements of this meeting of the World Peace Council are of tremendous significance for the further expansion and strengthening of the world peace movement.
    The World Peace Council's meeting was convened at a time when the call of people around the world for peaceful negotiation to resolve international disputes in order to ease international tensions was reaching an unprecedented high. As World Peace Council President Joliot-Curie pointed out in his opening speech: "The people of all countries believe that consultation is a way to ease and eliminate international tensions, to end armed conflicts, to resolve international disputes, to make disarmament possible and to organize disarmament." Since the World Peace Council called on peace organizations and people of all countries in June this year to urge their governments to negotiate and reach agreements, the movement of people around the world demanding peaceful negotiation to ease international tensions has developed rapidly. This movement has received enthusiastic support from the people of the Soviet Union, China, and the entire peace and democracy camp. Thanks to the persistent efforts of China and North Korea in adhering to a peaceful policy, and with the support of the Soviet Union and peace-loving people around the world, the Korean armistice was finally achieved, and international tensions began to ease somewhat. China and North Korea are now firmly upholding the Korean Armistice Agreement that has been reached and are actively seeking a thorough solution to the Korean issue. In order to promote further easing of the international situation, the Soviet Union continues to make tremendous efforts. The Soviet Union's initiative to have the five major powers discuss measures to ease international tensions has been warmly supported by the people of all countries. Recently, the Soviet government, with the desire to promote a quick solution to international issues that have matured, expressed its readiness to participate in the four-power foreign ministers' meeting to discuss European security issues and resolve the German issue. This is undoubtedly further proof of the Soviet Union's sincere commitment to peaceful resolution of international disputes.
    However, the international aggressor bloc, headed by the reactionary forces of the United States, is unwilling to see a further easing of the international situation and continues to pursue its "cold war" policy. The POW explanation work has been completely stalled due to the sabotage by the US side, and the United States is doing everything possible to delay the convening of a political conference. On the Vietnam issue, the United States continues to support France in military adventures in an attempt to prolong and expand the war. On the German issue, the United States continues to coerce its Western European puppets to delay and obstruct the peaceful resolution of the German issue, and is stepping up the implementation of the "European Army" plan aimed at reviving the West German militarist forces, making West Germany increasingly the main breeding ground for a new war in Europe. In addition, in order to establish new military alliances and expand its network of military bases around the world, the United States, after recently signing military agreements with Spain, Greece, and other countries, is also conducting negotiations with Pakistan to establish a military alliance, while intensifying its conspiracy to rearm Japan.
    The facts show that the reactionary forces in the United States are still continuing to obstruct the easing of international tensions. The political leaders of the United States also express their willingness to conduct peaceful consultations, but they have put forward many unreasonable preconditions and faits accomplis to hinder consultations. The United States has adopted a stubborn attitude of resistance and evasion towards the Soviet Union's repeated proposal to convene a five-power conference to review measures to ease international tensions. This has prevented the current international tensions from being further eased. Therefore, further developing the movement to strive for a peaceful resolution of international disputes is the most urgent and important task for all peace-loving people around the world.
    The Vienna meeting of the World Peace Council has formulated a broad program of action for the further struggle for peace. The general resolution adopted by the meeting emphasized convening a five-power conference as the most effective way to ease international tensions, and condemned any attempt to obstruct a five-power conference. This proposition is entirely correct. As pointed out in the "World Peace Council's Letter to Organizations and Individuals Hoping to Ease International Tensions," "Without the participation of the government of the People's Republic of China, it is impossible to resolve issues of world importance or ensure the implementation of any agreement." As long as the five-power conference is convened, this in itself will be a major step forward in the direction of consolidating world peace and easing international tensions. And the five-power conference will be able to and necessary to discuss any issues related to international tensions raised by any member state, and pass agreements acceptable to everyone. The World Peace Council calls on all peace-loving people to work to promote the early convening of a five-power conference, which is entirely correct for the current movement to strive for a peaceful resolution of international disputes.
    It should be admitted that the differences and disputes that exist internationally cannot be completely resolved all at once, and therefore, consultation on any particular issue is necessary. Issues such as the Korean issue and the German issue already have a basis for consultation, and must be prevented from being undermined. The World Peace Council gave active support to the efforts of China and North Korea to convene a Korean political conference as soon as possible, and to the Soviet Union to convene a four-power foreign ministers' meeting as soon as possible; at the same time, it pointed out that the proposal put forward by the Vietnamese delegation at the meeting for peaceful negotiation to resolve the Vietnam issue should be taken as the basis for resolving the Vietnam war issue. These resolutions are undoubtedly suited to the current urgent needs and will certainly be supported by a broader mass of people in countries around the world.
    We, the Chinese people, whether in the past, present, or future, firmly believe that peaceful consultation is the proper way to resolve international disputes. Therefore, we firmly support the resolutions and calls of the Vienna meeting of the World Peace Council, and are willing to unite closely with the peace-loving people of the world, to thwart any conspiracy by the international reactionary group to obstruct the easing of international tensions, and to persist in our efforts to ease international tensions.

### 为缓和国际紧张局势而努力

    为缓和国际紧张局势而努力
    世界和平理事会在维也纳举行的会议已胜利闭幕了。会议针对目前的国际形势，通过了重要的决议，号召各国人民采取有力的行动以促成国际协商和协议的实现，并建议筹备一次国际会议，讨论缓和国际局势问题。世界和平理事会本次会议所获得的重大成就，对于世界和平运动的进一步扩大和加强，是有极其巨大的意义的。
    世界和平理事会这一次会议是在全世界人民要求和平协商解决国际争端以缓和国际紧张局势的呼声空前高涨的时候召开的。正如世界和平理事会主席约里奥—居里在会议开幕时的演说中所指出的：“各国人民认为协商是缓和并消除国际紧张局势的办法，是结束武装冲突、解决国际争端，使裁减军备成为可能并组织裁军的办法。”自从世界和平理事会在今年六月间号召各国和平组织和人民促使他们的政府进行协商并达成协议以来，全世界人民要求和平协商缓和国际紧张局势的运动，有了迅速的发展。这个运动获得苏联、中国和整个和平民主阵营的各国人民的热烈支持。由于中朝两国坚持和平政策并在苏联及全世界爱好和平人民的支持下，进行了不懈的努力，终于促成了朝鲜停战，使国际紧张局势开始有了某些缓和。中朝两国现在正坚决地维护已经达成的朝鲜停战协定，积极谋求朝鲜问题的彻底解决。为了促使国际局势的进一步缓和，苏联继续进行着巨大的努力。苏联主张五大国在一起讨论缓和国际紧张局势的措施问题的倡议，已获得了各国人民的热烈拥护。最近苏联政府本着促成已经成熟了的国际问题迅速解决的愿望，表示准备参加四国外长会议，讨论欧洲安全问题和解决德国问题，这无疑是苏联真诚地致力于和平解决国际争端的又一明证。
    但是，以美国反动势力为首的国际侵略集团，却不愿看到国际局势的进一步缓和，继续奉行其“冷战”政策。战俘解释工作由于遭到美方的破坏而陷于完全停顿，同时美国对政治会议的召开也正千方百计地加以拖延。在越南问题上，美国继续支持法国进行军事冒险，以图延长和扩大战争。在德国问题上，美国继续胁迫其西欧仆从拖延和阻挠和平解决德国问题，并加紧推行以复活西德军国主义势力为目的的“欧洲军”计划，使西德日益成为欧洲新战争的主要温床。此外，美国为了建立新的军事联盟和扩大其在世界各地的军事基地网，最近在和西班牙、希腊等国签订了军事协定之后，又与巴基斯坦进行建立军事同盟的谈判，同时并变本加厉地在策划重新武装日本的阴谋。
    事实显示，美国反动势力还在继续阻挠国际紧张局势的缓和。美国的政治领袖一方面也表示愿意进行和平协商，但是他们提出了许多无理的先决条件和先决事实，以阻碍协商。对于苏联一再主张召开五大国会议审查缓和国际紧张局势措施的建议，美国采取了抗拒与规避的顽固态度。这就使目前国际紧张局势还不能进一步缓和。因此，进一步开展争取和平解决国际争端的运动，乃是全世界一切爱好和平的人们当前最迫切和最重大的任务。
    世界和平理事会维也纳会议为进一步争取和平的斗争制定了广泛的行动纲领。会议所通过的总决议中，强调召开五大国会议作为缓和国际局势最有效的方式，并斥责任何阻挠五大国会议的企图。这种主张是完全正确的。正如“世界和平理事会告希望缓和国际紧张局势的各组织和个人书”中所指出的，“没有中华人民共和国政府参加，要想解决有世界重要性的问题或保证任何协议的履行是不可能的。”只要五大国会议一旦召开，这事情本身就将是向着巩固世界和平及缓和国际局势的方向前进了一大步。而五大国会议对于任何成员国所提出的任何与国际紧张局势有关的问题，都将有可能和必要加以讨论，并通过大家都能接受的协议。世界和平理事会号召一切爱好和平人民为促成五大国会议的早日召开而努力，这对于目前争取和平解决国际争端的运动是完全正确的。
    应该承认，国际间存在的分歧和争端，并不是一下子可以全部解决的，因此，对任何特殊问题的协商都具有必要性。如朝鲜问题和德国问题，都已有了进行协商的基础，就必须防止它受到破坏。世界和平理事会对于中朝两国为迅速召开朝鲜政治会议以及苏联为迅速召开四国外长会议而从事的努力，给予积极的支持；同时指出越南代表团在会议上所提出的和平协商解决越南问题的建议，应当作为解决越南战争问题的基础。这些决议，无疑都是适合于目前的迫切要求的，因而一定能够得到世界各国更广大的人民群众的拥护。
    我们中国人民，无论在过去、现在和将来，都坚信和平协商是解决国际争端的正当途径。因此我们坚决拥护世界和平理事会维也纳会议的决议和号召，愿与全世界爱好和平的人民亲密团结，挫败国际反动集团阻挠缓和国际紧张局势的任何阴谋，为缓和国际紧张局势而坚持努力。
