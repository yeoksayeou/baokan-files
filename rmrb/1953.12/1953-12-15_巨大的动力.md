    A Great Motivation
    Experiences from various regions prove that as long as education on the general line and general task of the state during the transition period is widely and deeply carried out in industrial and mining enterprises, the ideological awareness of the workers will be greatly enhanced, and it will become a great driving force for promoting the increase production and practice economy movement. The practice of the Nanjing Chemical Plant, as reported by the Nanjing Xinhua Daily on November 24th, is a clear example.
    According to the Nanjing Xinhua Daily, the Party organization of the Nanjing Chemical Plant attaches great importance to carrying out propaganda and education on the general line and general task of the transition period among the workers. This propaganda and education work, under the leadership of the Party branch of the plant, organized the forces of the trade union and the Communist Youth League, and adopted the steps of from within the Party to outside the Party, from cadres to the masses, and has achieved "known to every household, known to everyone." In the past week, all workers, engineers, technicians, clerks, and even guards and cooks in the factory have generally listened to one to three reports and conducted three to four informal discussions. In order to achieve "no one is left out," the Party branch made two supplementary reports to the workers who did not hear the report; the second supplementary report was specifically reported to six workers working the night shift. After all the workers basically understood the content of the general line and general task, the Party branch used the method of testing to understand the degree of understanding of the workers. For comrades who do not understand, repeat remedial lessons. In addition, two reports were made to all employees’ families, and discussions are being prepared.
    The report specifically pointed out that the Nanjing Chemical Plant paid attention to combining with the actual situation of the plant, combining with increasing production and practicing economy, and combining with the current work in various aspects when carrying out this education. For example, the factory is about to switch to standard rice, so it used the grain issue as the content and specifically reported to everyone the significance of saving grain, strengthening the worker-peasant alliance, and realizing socialist industrialization. Some workers and their families did not understand the reasons for the temporary difficulties in the supply of soybean oil in the market. The secretary of the Party branch personally reported to the families, talking about the lack of soybean oil and the abominable speculation of unscrupulous merchants, and then related to the importance of socialist industrialization, calling on everyone to do a good job in housework so that workers can work with peace of mind and work hard to build socialism.
    After studying the general line and general task of the transition period, the workers not only significantly improved their socialist consciousness, but also clearly understood the relationship between "their own production" and "socialism," thus greatly inspiring their labor enthusiasm. The newspaper vividly described the workers' high confidence and enthusiasm for building socialism. For example, electrician Zhao Guangde used a metaphor in his study: "It's like climbing a mountain. The beautiful socialism is on the mountain. In the past, I only heard that there was socialism on this mountain, but I didn't see it, so I was a little afraid of hardship when I encountered a gully or a depression. Now I really see it. If you want to reach the top of the mountain, you can't be afraid of gullies and depressions. Chairman Mao pointed out the way and gave the method, so we just have to work hard!" Recently, he is planning to automate some manual operations. He said, "Add some effort, and socialism will be one step closer." Since the workshop workers began to study the general line and general task of the transition period, the production volume has been gradually increasing. By November 23, they had completed the November production task ahead of schedule. After worker Chen Yusheng understood the relationship between increasing production and practicing economy and socialist industrialization, he self-criticized and said: "In the past, I saw that we handed in so much profit every year, but we didn't even build an auditorium. I felt uncomfortable when I went to a meeting in a big shed. I thought: Talk about increasing production and saving money, but the meeting is still held in a shed. What is it all for! This time I understand, industrialization requires so much money, where does it come from? Isn't it靠(kào) accumulated through our production. Money should be used where it is needed. For the sake of socialism, it is comfortable to have meetings in the shed for another two years. Is that enough? No, we have to work harder to create more funds."
    In order to promote the practice of the Nanjing Chemical Plant in carrying out in-depth general line education, the Nanjing Xinhua Daily published a short commentary. The short commentary pointed out that making the Party's general line and general task during the transition period deeply rooted in the hearts of every worker is a major political task for all factories and mines. As long as the workers understand the principles of the general line and general task, they will generate a conscious force for building socialism, which will become a great driving force for realizing the country's socialist industrialization. The short commentary called on all factories and mines to learn from the practice of the Nanjing Chemical Plant.

### 巨大的动力

    巨大的动力
    各地经验证明，只要在工矿企业中广泛深入地进行国家在过渡时期总路线总任务的教育，就能大大提高职工群众的思想觉悟，并成为推动增产节约运动的巨大动力。南京新华日报十一月二十四日报道的南京化工厂的作法，就是一个明显的例子。
    据南京新华日报报道，南京化工厂的党组织很重视向职工群众进行过渡时期总路线总任务的宣传教育。这一宣传教育工作在该厂党支部领导下，组织了工会和青年团的力量，采取了从党内到党外、从干部到群众的步骤，已做到“家喻户晓，人人皆知”。一星期来，该厂全体工人、工程师、技术人员、职员以至警卫、炊事人员，都普遍听过一次至三次报告，并进行了三次至四次的漫谈讨论。为了做到“一人不漏”，党支部对未听到报告的职工，先后作了两次补充报告；第二次补充报告是专门报告给六个做夜班的工人听的。在全体职工基本上了解了总路线总任务的内容后，党支部又运用测验的办法，来了解职工们的理解程度。对于弄不懂的同志，再反复地进行补课。此外，还对全体职工家属作了两次报告，并准备组织讨论。
    报道中特别指出，南京化工厂在进行这一教育时，注意到与本厂的实际情况相结合，与增产节约相结合，与当前各方面的工作相结合。如厂里将要改吃标准米，就以粮食问题为内容，专门向大家报告了一次节约粮食、加强工农联盟、实现社会主义工业化的意义。部分职工及家属对市场豆油供应暂时发生困难的原因不了解，党支部书记就亲自向家属们作报告，从豆油的缺乏谈到奸商投机的可恶，从而联系到社会主义工业化的重要，号召大家做好家务，让职工们安心生产，努力建设社会主义。
    职工们学习了过渡时期的总路线总任务后，不仅显著地提高了社会主义觉悟，而且明确认识了“本身生产”与“社会主义”之间的关系，因而大大激发了劳动热情。报纸生动地描写了工人们对建设社会主义的高度信心和热情。如电工赵广德在学习中打譬喻说：“就像爬山，山上就是美好的社会主义，可是在过去，我光听说这山上有社会主义，就没看到，所以碰到个山沟山洼的，就有些怕艰苦。现在我真看到了。要到山顶就不能怕沟沟洼洼，毛主席指出了路，又给了办法，就剩下我们加油干啦！”最近，他正计划着把某些用人力劳动的操作自动化起来。他说“加一把油，社会主义就近一步。”哨化车间工人从开始学习过渡时期的总路线总任务后，生产量就在逐步提高，到十一月二十三日，已提前完成了十一月份的生产任务。工人陈玉生懂得了增产节约和社会主义工业化的关系后，便自我批判说：“以前我看到我们一年上缴这么多的利润，却连礼堂都不盖，一到大草棚里开会心里就不舒服，心里想：谈增产论节约，结果开会还是草棚子，到底为了什么呀！这次我可明亮了，工业化要那么多的资金，那里来？还不是靠我们生产积累。钱要用在刀口上，为了社会主义，再在草棚子里开两年会也舒服。这就够了吗？不行，还得加油生产多创造资金哩。”
    南京新华日报为推广南京化工厂深入进行总路线教育的作法，发表了短评。短评指出：使党在过渡时期的总路线总任务深入到每个工人的心里去，是一切厂矿的重大的政治任务。只要工人们弄通了总路线总任务的道理后，就会产生一种建设社会主义的自觉的力量，这个力量将成为实现国家社会主义工业化的巨大动力。短评号召各厂矿学习南京化工厂的作法。
