Wan Daying is a Good Example of Selling Surplus Grain
Gao Changren, Mei Xianruo

This year is the third year since the land reform in Gongjiaqiao Township, Wuchang County, Hubei Province. In the past three years, the life of Wan Daying, a peasant who has been emancipated, and her family of four, including her three daughters, has been improving year by year. The year before last, she had just been allocated land and had very little to start with. She didn't have enough grain to eat and couldn't afford to buy clothes. This autumn, she had a bumper harvest of 46 *shi* of grain, and after deducting what was needed for eating and use, there was a surplus of five *shi* of grain. Having five *shi* of surplus grain at home was a first in the 25 years since she married into the Huang family. Therefore, the whole family was able to buy single and cotton clothes this year. They can also eat white rice three meals a day, and have no shortage of oil, salt, and side dishes. Wan Daying often says, "I never dreamed that the whole family would be able to eat their fill of white rice, and that the girls would be able to wear new clothes."

Wan Daying, who has been emancipated, enthusiastically responds to every call from the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. When there was a call to organize, she joined the mutual aid team; when there was a call to increase production and practice thrift, she cultivated more than one *mu* of *yangsun* (ratoon rice), which yielded an additional six *shi* of grain. Now that Chairman Mao is calling on farmers to take the socialist road, she sells her surplus grain to the state to support the country's industrialization.

On November 9th, Gongjiaqiao Township launched a campaign to publicize the general line. Wan Daying is one of the peasant representatives of Huangjia Old House, and she attended the meeting of township cadres and activists. Wan Daying, who suffered deep oppression in the old society, quickly understood these principles. She supports the general line, and she also understands that in order to support the country's industrialization, farmers should sell their surplus grain to the state.

However, when faced with the practical question of whether or not to sell her own surplus grain, she had some ideological struggles. She thought of her past life of being cold and hungry: she is 41 years old this year, and she has been married into the Huang family since she was 16. In the past, she only had eight *fen* of land and also cultivated six *mu* of ancestral hall land. The two adults worked hard, but it was never enough to eat. More than a decade ago, her husband contracted tuberculosis, and life became even more difficult. Without food, she had to endure the exploitation of high-interest loans, borrowing from landlords and rich peasants. When the new grain was harvested in the autumn, it was picked away by the creditors on the threshing ground. After paying rent, she never got to eat the new grain she harvested. After that, she could only borrow from others again. But as soon as it was the busy season, the creditors would demand that she work to repay the debt. Every year during the busy farming season, she always had to help others finish planting their crops before she could plant her own fields. In those days, wild vegetables were her family's staple food every spring. Thinking of this, although she wanted to keep the grain to prepare for lean years, she also thought: "Why are we able to live a good life now and no longer suffer from cold and hunger? Isn't it because we were emancipated under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao? Chairman Mao is calling on us to take the socialist road, and in order to help the country's industrialization, farmers should sell their surplus grain to the state. It is such an honor." She also thought: "This spring, I was short of two months of food, and I had to earn some money by breaking stones at Guanshan and buy rice at the cooperative. The price of rice has always been 950 yuan per *jin*. Isn't all this grain bought by the state from farmers in other places? If the state hadn't been able to buy grain last year, wouldn't we have starved this spring? Conversely, if we have a bumper harvest this year and don't sell the surplus grain to the state, where will the farmers in other disaster-stricken areas go to buy grain?" At this point, she already felt that it was wrong not to sell grain to the state, and she also thought that as long as farmers sell their surplus grain to the state, the state will have grain, and no place will be short of grain. Thinking like this, she no longer planned to store grain to prepare for famine. That night, her mind kept thinking, tossing and turning, unable to sleep. Thinking of the past suffering, she felt sad and wanted to cry. Thinking of the present emancipation and future happiness, she smiled with joy. Finally, she came to the conclusion: "To live a good life, we must have industrialization; to have industrialization, we must sell grain to the state." At the meeting the next day, she said: "I walked the old road for decades and almost died from it. I have only walked the new road for four years, and I have been emancipated. In the past, two laborers farmed the land, but we were so poor that we had no food to eat. Now, one laborer farms the land, but it gets better year by year. Without Chairman Mao's leadership, how could I have this today? I am determined to take the new road, and I will sell my five *shi* of surplus grain to the state."

After returning home, Wan Daying continued to actively promote the general line and mobilize the farmers in her village to sell their surplus grain to the state.

In Huangjia Old House, there was an emancipated peasant named Wang Xiugui, who was a member of the peasant association. He also understood many great principles from studying the general line, but he remained silent when it came to selling surplus grain to the state. He left several meetings halfway through. The village cadres all said: "Wang Xiugui's thinking is difficult to change!"

On November 30th, Wan Daying found Wang Xiugui at his home and chatted with him in detail under a kerosene lamp. Starting from Wang Xiugui's arrival in Huangjia Old House more than 20 years ago to cultivate the landlord's land and be exploited by the landlord, Wan Daying deliberately brought up her own past painful life to enlighten his class consciousness. When Wang Xiugui mentioned his past life, he said:

"The suffering is endless. I can't help but shed tears when I mention it." He talked about the landlord's exploitation of collecting one *shi* of rent for one *dou* of land, about being an outsider and being oppressed by the Huang family landlords and rich peasants in the past, and about the Kuomintang reactionaries' conscription, levies, and exorbitant taxes…. Wan Daying said, "What about now? Whether you are from Huanggang or Echeng, no one dares to bully you anymore. The peasants of the world are one family. How much benefit did you get from the land reform? You got land and housing, and you even became a member of the peasant association. How did such a good life come about?"

Wang Xiugui said, "I know this principle. How could we have been emancipated without Chairman Mao's leadership? I am determined to take the new road." Wan Daying also expressed that she also wanted to firmly take the new road and was preparing to sell all five *shi* of her surplus grain to the state. She then asked Wang Xiugui, "How much surplus grain are you preparing to sell?"

Wang Xiugui hesitated.

Wan Daying patiently explained many principles to him again. She said, "You and I are both cadres. We have never fallen behind in work such as land reform, re-examination, and autumn tax collection. We are both leaders of the masses!" She also used an analogy: "We are like walking a road, and we have already walked seventy or eighty *li*. How can we not reach the end? I am determined to reach socialism. It's like fighting a war, we can only move forward, not backward."

Wang Xiugui paused for a long time and then hesitantly said his true thoughts: "I'm just afraid that if we encounter some famine next year, it will be difficult to deal with if we sell too much and the family quarrels!"

Wan Daying then talked about her own process of changing her mind from preparing to store grain for famine, and Wang Xiugui nodded repeatedly. She also said, "Chairman Mao is like the head of the family. We all sell our surplus grain to the state so that he can arrange national construction well. If we have surplus grain and don't sell it, not only will national construction have difficulties, but what will happen to the people in other disaster-stricken areas who have no grain to eat? You are also someone who has come from a hard life. Can you bear to let them go hungry? Besides, if the workers have no grain to eat, how can there be industrialization? How can we take the new road?"

Wang Xiugui thought that it wouldn't matter if he sold a little less grain. Wan Daying then asked him, "If one person stores one *shi*, how much will our entire township store? How much will the entire county and the entire Hubei Province store? Calculate this account!"

Wang Xiugui finally understood and reported that he would sell ten *shi* of surplus grain!

In this way, Wan Daying actively worked to change other people's thinking and enlightened the women to recognize the principle that they must take the new road. Now, everyone in Huangjia Old House regards Wan Daying as their good example.

    万达英是卖余粮的好榜样
    高长任　梅先若
    今年是湖北省武昌县龚家桥乡土地改革后的第三年。三年来翻身农民万达英和她三个女儿一家四口人的生活，年年上升。前年她刚分到土地，底子空，粮食还不够吃，也不能添置衣裳。今年秋天丰收了，四十六石谷子，除去吃、用之外，还有五石谷子的余粮。家里能有五石余粮，还是她嫁到黄家二十五年来的第一次。因此，今年全家每人又都添置了单衣和棉衣。一天三餐也能吃上白米饭，油盐小菜不缺。万达英常说：“我做梦也没有想到全家能吃饱白米饭，姑娘们能穿上新衣裳。”
    翻了身的万达英，对共产党、毛主席每次的号召都热烈响应。当号召组织起来时，她就参加了互助组；当号召增产节约时，她就蓄了一亩多田的秧孙（即再生稻），多收了六石谷子，现在毛主席号召农民走社会主义的道路，她就把余粮卖给国家，支援国家的工业化。
    十一月九日，龚家桥乡展开了关于总路线的宣传。万达英是黄家老屋的农民代表之一，她参加了乡干部和积极分子会议。在旧社会受过深重压迫的万达英很快就懂得了这些道理，她拥护总路线，她也懂得为了支援国家工业化，农民应该把多余粮食卖给国家。
    但是，碰到了实际问题，自己的余粮卖不卖呢？她在思想上不是没有斗争的。她想起了过去挨冻受饿的生活来：自从十六岁嫁到了黄家，今年四十一岁。过去，自己只有八分田，又佃种祠堂田六亩，夫妻两口成年劳动，总是不够吃的。十几年前，丈夫生了痨病，生活更困难，没有吃的，只好忍受高利贷的剥削，向地主、富农去借，秋天收了新谷，就在场上被债主挑走了，加上交租，自己收到新谷却吃不到新谷。以后，就只有再向别人借。但一到忙月，债主就要她做工还债，每年农忙紧张时，总要先帮别人把庄稼种完，才来种自己的田。那时每年春天，野菜就是她家的主粮。想到这里，她虽想把粮食留下，防备荒年，但是又想到：“现在为什么能过好生活，不再挨冻受饿了，还不是在共产党、毛主席领导下才翻了身。毛主席号召我们走社会主义的道路，为了帮助国家工业化，农民就该把余粮卖给国家。是多末光荣的事。”她又想起：“今年春天自己缺两个月的口粮，全靠在官山打石碴，挣点钱到合作社买米吃，米价一直是九百五十元一斤，这些粮食还不都是国家在别的地方农民手中买来的。要是去年国家买不到粮食，那我们今春不是又要挨饿吗？反过来想，我们今年丰收有余粮不卖给国家，那别的受灾地方的农民又到那里去买粮食吃呢？”这时，她已感到不卖粮食给国家是不对的，又想到只要农民把余粮都卖给国家，国家有粮食，什么地方也不会缺粮的。这样一想，她也就不打算存粮防荒了。这一天晚上，她脑子不停地想，翻来覆去睡不着，想到过去的痛苦，她心酸得要流泪，想到现在的翻身和将来的幸福，她又喜欢得笑起来。最后她得出结论：“要过好日子，就要有工业化；要工业化，就一定要把粮食卖给国家”。在第二天的会议上她这样的说：“我在旧道路上走了几十年，差一点折磨死了；新道路刚走了四年，我就翻了身。我过去两个劳动力种田，穷得没饭吃；现在一个劳动力种田，却一年好一年。不是毛主席领导，我怎么能有今天，我坚决要走新道路，我要把五石余粮卖给国家。”
    回家以后，万达英接着就积极宣传总路线，动员本村农民把余粮卖给国家。
    黄家老屋有个翻身农民叫王修贵，是农会的一个委员，他学习总路线也懂得许多大道理，可是一谈到把余粮卖给国家，就不发言了。有几次会议还没开完，他中途溜走了。村干部都说：王修贵的思想难打通！
    十一月三十日，万达英把王修贵找到家里来，在一盏煤油灯下，细细地和他谈起家常来。从王修贵二十多年前来黄家老屋种地主的田受地主剥削谈起，万达英并有意地扯上了自己过去的痛苦生活来启发他的阶级觉悟。提起过去的生活来，王修贵说：
  “苦处说不尽，一提起就要掉泪。”他谈到地主一斗田交一石租的剥削，谈起自己是外姓，过去受黄姓地主、富农的压迫，谈起国民党反动派的拉丁、派款、苛捐杂税……。万达英说：“现在呢？管你是黄冈人、鄂城人，再没有人敢欺侮你，天下农民是一家，土地改革你得到几多好处？分到田地又分到房屋，还当了农会委员，这样的好日子怎么来的？”
    王修贵说：“这个道理我知道，不是毛主席领导我们怎么能翻身，我是坚决走新道路的。”万达英也表示自己同样要坚决走新道路，正准备要把五石余粮全卖给国家，她接着问王修贵：“你准备卖几多余粮？”
    王修贵迟疑不决。
    万达英耐心地又对他讲了许多道理，她说：“你我都是个干部，土地改革，复查，秋征，那样工作也没落过后，都是群众的带头人！”她又打个比方：“我们好比走路，已走了七八十里，怎么能不走到头呢！我是拚命也要走到社会主义的。好比打仗一样，只能向前，不能退后。”
    王修贵停了好大一会，吞吞吐吐地才说出真心话：“我就是怕明年遇上了什么荒年，卖的多了，家里人吵吵闹闹的难办！”
    万达英又把自己原来准备存粮备荒的思想转变过程谈出来，王修贵连连点头。她又说：“毛主席好比是当家人，我们大家都把余粮卖给国家，他老人家才好安排国家建设。如果我们有余粮不卖，不说国家建设发生困难，别的地方受灾荒的人没粮吃怎么办？你也是从苦日子过来的人，能让他们挨饿？再说，工人没粮食吃，还能有工业化？我们还能走新道路？”
    王修贵还以为自己少卖石把粮食没有关系，万达英就问他：“一个人存一石，我们全乡要存多少？全县、全湖北省要存多少石，你算算这个账！”
    王修贵终于想通了，自报出卖十石余粮！
     就是这样，万达英积极打通别人思想，并启发妇女们认识一定要走新道路的道理。现在黄家老屋的人们大大小小都把万达英当作他们的好榜样。
