    Guangdong's Fengshun and other Counties Resolve Mountain Forest Disputes, Promoting Farmers' Forest Protection and Cultivation
    Guangdong Province's eastern Fengshun, Dabu, and other counties have resolved over 800 mountain forest disputes, promoting farmers' active forest protection and cultivation.
    In the privately-owned forest areas of South China, after the completion of land reform, the remaining problem was that some mountain forests were either not divided when they should have been, or the division was crude, leading farmers to indiscriminately fell trees, compete for forest land, and frequently engage in disputes. After the Rural Work Department of the CCP Central Committee's South China Sub-bureau put forward opinions and methods for handling mountain forest disputes in July of this year, the CCP Guangdong East District Committee immediately instructed all counties to set aside a certain amount of time in September and October, under the unified leadership of the Party Committee, to concentrate efforts on resolving mountain forest issues. The Guangdong East District Committee and the Guangdong East Administrative Office also dispatched inspection teams to the countryside in early October to assist in local investigation and handling. All counties successively convened cadre meetings or representative meetings to arrange the work of handling mountain forest disputes, and organized a group of cadres under the personal leadership of the county party committee to go to the countryside, conduct in-depth investigations to understand the situation, and resolve mountain forest disputes through democratic consultation between the two sides, based on the principles of taking into account historical customs, being conducive to production, and being conducive to unity. According to incomplete statistics from Fengshun, Dabu, Chaoyang, Heyuan, Raoping, Zijin, Puning and other counties, there were 1,176 original mountain forest problems, of which 805 have been resolved and 371 are being processed. Longchuan, Fengshun and other counties with larger mountain forest problems have basically completed the handling, and Raoping, Zijin, Heyuan, Xingning, Dabu, Jiaoling and Pingyuan were also completed by the end of October. Therefore, the chaotic situation caused by mountain forest problems in the past and the tense situation of disputes among the masses have been basically stabilized. The policy has been further implemented, the internal unity of the peasants has been strengthened, the connection between the Party and the people's government and the masses has become closer, and the farmers' production enthusiasm has been greatly improved. After handling mountain forests, farmers in various places have also formulated covenants for mountain protection and afforestation, actively afforesting and protecting forests. Zeng Yulin, a farmer from Fengxin Township, Longchuan, has planted more than 200 pine trees on the mountains he has been allocated.

    广东丰顺等县解决山林纠纷
    推动了农民护林育林
    广东省东部丰顺、大埔等县解决山林纠纷八百多宗，推动了农民积极护林育林。
    华南私有林地区在土地改革完成以后，遗留下来的问题是有些山林当分未分，或分得粗糙，致使农民乱伐林木，互争林地，经常发生纠纷。中共中央华南分局农村工作部今年七月提出处理山林纠纷的意见和办法后，中共粤东区党委即指示各县在九、十月份划出一定时间，由党委统一领导，集中一定力量，解决山林问题。粤东区党委和粤东行署并在十月初派出检查组下乡协助各地调查处理。各县都先后召开了干部会议或代表会，布置处理山林纠纷工作，并组织了一批干部由县委亲自领导下乡，深入调查摸清情况，根据照顾历史习惯，有利生产，有利团结的原则，由双方民主协商，解决山林纠纷问题。据丰顺、大埔、潮阳、河源、饶平、紫金、普宁等县不完全统计，原有山林问题一千一百七十六宗，已处理解决了八百零五宗，正在处理的三百七十一宗。山林问题较大的龙川、丰顺等县已基本处理完毕，饶平、紫金、河源、兴宁、大埔、蕉岭、平远也于十月底处理完毕。因此，过去因山林问题引起的混乱现象和群众间发生纠纷的紧张局面，已基本安定下来。政策进一步贯彻了，农民内部团结加强了，党和人民政府和群众的联系更加密切，农民生产情绪格外提高。各地处理山林以后，农民还订出了护山育林公约，积极造林护林。龙川丰新乡农民曾育林在分得的山上已种下二百多棵松树。
