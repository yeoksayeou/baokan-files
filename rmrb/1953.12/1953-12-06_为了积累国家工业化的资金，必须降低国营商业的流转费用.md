In order to accumulate funds for national industrialization, it is necessary to reduce the circulation costs of state-owned commerce.
Zhao Yumin Wang Desheng
The general goal of my country's first Five-Year Plan is to concentrate major efforts on developing heavy industry, in order to establish the foundation for national industrialization and national defense modernization, and to ensure the further growth of socialist components in the national economy. The funds for developing heavy industry mainly rely on internal resources and internal accumulation. Therefore, it is of decisive significance to not only tap and mobilize all potential forces in the industrial sector, increase production, improve product quality, practice strict economy, and reduce product costs to ensure the victorious completion of the construction plan; but also to carry out various economies in commerce, especially state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce, which has a significant effect on accumulating industrialization funds.
Commodity production currently occupies a fairly broad scope in our country. Commerce is an important way of distributing and exchanging social labor products in our country. State-owned and cooperative commercial departments not only control the distribution and exchange of a large amount of industrial and agricultural products, but also have a huge and complex organization and a large number of employees, requiring a large amount of expenditure. Therefore, improving business management, expanding commodity circulation, and reducing costs in state-owned commercial departments cannot but be an important source for the country's industrialization fund accumulation. As the February 19, this year's People's Daily editorial "Strive to Guarantee the Realization of the 1953 National Budget" pointed out: "If the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and the Ministry of Food increase the capital turnover rate from 2.45 times per year to 2.68 times, they can increase national revenue by 30,000 billion yuan. If state-owned commercial departments can reduce the circulation cost, which accounts for 15.75 percent of the total value of commodities, to 14 percent, they can also relatively increase national revenue by 30,000 billion yuan." From this, it is not difficult to understand the role of state-owned commercial departments in accumulating funds for national industrialization by reducing commodity circulation costs.
We know that commodity circulation costs are the expenses incurred in delivering industrial and agricultural products to consumers, that is, the costs associated with the purchase, transportation, storage, packaging, sorting, and sales of commodities. Under the capitalist system, economic crises and market anarchy inevitably lead to roundabout transportation of commodities, speculation, and difficulties in commodity promotion, resulting in a large amount of non-productive expenditure in transportation, storage, and advertising. Therefore, the level of capitalist circulation costs continues to grow. This is an inevitable result of the basic contradiction of capitalism—the social nature of production and the capitalist private ownership. In contrast, in our country, since the state-owned economy occupies a leading position in the national economy, and since it is possible for our country to develop the national economy in a planned and proportionate manner, state-owned commercial departments have the possibility and must organize the circulation of commodities in a planned manner, try to reduce intermediate links, eliminate redundant transportation, and reduce storage and transportation losses, so that commodities can quickly reach consumers. In this way, there is a large objective possibility for state-owned commerce in our country to reduce commodity circulation costs. This objective possibility is also constantly growing. In the current transitional period, under the conditions of the existence of small commodity production and private capitalist industry and commerce, state-owned commerce, in order to lead the market and meet the needs of production and consumers, cannot save expenses in procurement, allocation, and sales as much as Soviet socialist commerce; but with the steady growth of socialist components in the national economy, and with the gradual realization of the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce, the objective possibility for state-owned commerce to reduce commodity circulation costs will inevitably gradually increase. In order to turn the possibilities we already have for reducing costs into reality, we must rely on the initiative and creativity of all employees, tap and mobilize all potential forces, be meticulous in calculations, practice strict economy, and make unremitting efforts to reduce circulation costs.
In November 1951, the former Central Trade Department convened the First National State-Owned Trade Commodity Circulation Cost Work Conference, which formulated interim measures for compiling commodity circulation cost plans and formulating commodity circulation cost quotas. The establishment and development of commodity circulation cost planning work played a great role in promoting the increase production and practice economy movement to save 30,000 billion yuan in commodity circulation costs in 1952. This year, the enterprise system under the Central Ministry of Commerce has also universally implemented the economic accounting system, improved the operation and management of enterprises, and created conditions for further reducing costs. Because state-owned commercial departments have strengthened the planning of commodity circulation costs and have begun to pay attention to improving the business operation methods and working methods, such as implementing direct allocation and increasing storage and transportation capacity, certain results have been achieved in saving commodity circulation costs. However, there are still many shortcomings in the work of reducing commodity circulation costs. The main manifestations are that there are still unreasonable phenomena in commodity allocation and storage, resulting in excessive transportation and storage costs, and the interest expenditure burdened by accumulated funds and the level of business management costs still account for a considerable proportion of the total commodity circulation cost expenditure. In the first half of this year, the actual cost levels of many enterprises exceeded the planned quotas. The main reason for the cost overruns is that the conservation system has not been strictly implemented, or it can be said that the economic accounting system has not been well implemented.
The economic accounting system is the most important lever for implementing the conservation system. The economic accounting system requires us to rationally and meticulously use human, material, and financial resources while completing the national plan tasks, and to prevent and eliminate all unplanned losses. Therefore, every state-owned commercial enterprise that implements the economic accounting system must first reasonably organize and expand commodity circulation and accelerate capital turnover. This is an important key to reducing commodity circulation costs. To this end, we must be good at studying the needs of residents, signing purchase and sales contracts based on production and sales conditions, planning the transportation and allocation of goods, and purchasing goods that meet consumer needs in a timely manner. In this way, we can speed up sales and avoid out-of-stock or backlog of goods, improve the quality of service to production and consumers, and at the same time, we must reduce the transportation and storage costs of goods and the level of all circulation costs. However, in the work of expanding sales and reducing costs, we must also pay attention to preventing the following biases: For example, in order to accelerate capital turnover and avoid bearing more interest, compressing inventory so that reasonable fixed reserve cannot be maintained, which will not guarantee sufficient supply to the market. For example, only paying attention to completing the quantitative indicators of the plan, and ignoring the completion of the plan by variety, which will weaken the leading role of state-owned commerce in the market; For example, only focusing on the completion of the plan of this unit, and not paying attention to the observance of contract discipline, not paying attention to the processing, ordering, and sales work of private industry and commerce, which will inevitably affect the completion of the plans of other state-owned enterprises with supply and marketing contract relations, and at the same time, it will not be able to gradually carry out the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce. In short, the completion of the plan and the implementation of the policy must be well combined. Comrade Stalin said: "In life, in practice, politics and economics are inseparable. They exist together and function together. Whoever wants to separate economics and politics in our actual work, to strengthen economic work at the expense of weakening political work, or vice versa, to strengthen political work at the expense of weakening economic work, he must fall into a dead end." [Note 1] This valuable instruction is also of great significance to the increase production and practice economy movement launched by state-owned commerce.
Secondly, in order to reduce commodity circulation costs, we must rely on the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of employees, make saving costs a mass movement, and enable every commercial worker to establish a correct view of saving costs. We must not mechanically oppose saving costs to completing business work. Some people think that as long as the business work is done well, it does not matter if more money is spent. Others think that state-owned commerce is a "big business," and a little bit of expenditure is nothing. This indifferent attitude towards saving costs is completely wrong and must be corrected in a timely manner. Comrade Molotov said: "We should strive to achieve so that all our staff, from the lower to the upper levels, will always remember their responsibility to the state and the people, always remember that they have an obligation to protect the people's property, treat this property with caution, abide by the conservation system in spending, and in fact cherish every penny of the people." [Note 2] We know that every state-owned enterprise that implements the economic accounting system is allocated a certain amount of fixed funds and circulating funds by the government as the material basis for completing the national plan tasks. There are a large number of commodities and materials and other material equipment in state-owned commercial enterprises. All these funds are the public property of all the people, and public property is the main material basis for the development of production and the prosperity of the economy in our motherland, and no erosion or waste is allowed. Therefore, all commercial staff not only have to protect the safety of these properties, but also have to rationally use these properties, strictly abide by the conservation system, and fight against all wasteful phenomena. In this way, we can increase revenue, complete the task of submitting profits, and accumulate funds for national industrialization. Only by correctly understanding the great significance of saving costs ideologically can we tap and mobilize all potential forces, improve business management, and launch a patriotic labor competition for increasing production and practicing economy. Comrade Stalin instructed us: "Competition is the method of building socialist communism based on the greatest initiative of millions of working people." [Note 3] Therefore, we must give play to the initiative of the broad masses of employees, vigorously carry out the competition movement, improve the labor productivity of commercial staff, improve the quality of commercial work, so as to expand purchases and sales and reduce circulation costs.
Finally, it should be pointed out that in order to reduce commodity circulation costs, it is also necessary to strengthen the planning and accounting of commodity circulation costs. We know that formulating cost quotas is the prerequisite for correctly compiling cost plans, and cost quotas are also the goals of struggle for mobilizing the broad masses of employees to reduce commodity circulation costs. Therefore, we should use and analyze the relevant cost expenditure data of accounting, and accurately formulate cost quotas in combination with the specific circumstances of the planning period. At the same time, the accounting indicators must be coordinated with the planning indicators, so that the accounting can correctly reflect the implementation of the cost plan, and strictly supervise the various cost expenditures within the scope stipulated in the plan. It is also necessary to analyze and study the reasons for cost overruns or savings based on accounting data, in order to eliminate shortcomings and disseminate advanced experience in saving costs. Strengthening cost analysis work is of great significance for promoting the entire commercial sector to reduce commodity circulation costs.
In short, in the state-owned commercial sector, in order to practice strict economy and reduce costs, it is necessary to vigorously implement the economic accounting system and improve the level of business management. Chairman Mao has long taught us that we must learn to do economic work. Therefore, we must constantly improve our political theory and professional level, actively learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, so as to be able to recognize and master objective economic laws, understand and implement the correct policies of the Party and the government, and strive to complete and overfulfill the state's plan.

    为了积累国家工业化的资金，必须降低国营商业的流转费用
    赵玉珉  王德升
    我国第一个五年计划的总目标，是要集中主要力量发展重工业，以建立国家工业化和国防现代化的基础，并保证国民经济中社会主义成份的进一步增长。发展重工业的资金，主要是靠内部资源，靠内部积累。因此，不但在工业部门中发掘与动员一切潜在力量，增加生产，提高产品质量，厉行节约，降低产品成本，对于保证胜利完成建设计划具有决定性的意义；就是在商业、尤其是国营商业及合作社商业进行各种节约，对于积累工业化资金也有重大的作用。
    我国目前商品生产占有相当广泛的范围，商业是我国社会劳动产品分配、交换的重要方式，国营和合作社的商业部门不仅掌握着庞大的工业品和农产品的分配与交换，而且也有了一套巨大复杂的机构和大批工作人员，需要很大的一笔开支，因此，国营商业部门改善经营管理工作，扩大商品流转，降低费用，就不能不是国家工业化积累资金的一个重要泉源。今年二月十九日人民日报发表的“为保证实现一九五三年的国家预算而斗争”的社论中曾指出：“商业部、对外贸易部、粮食部三个部门，如果把资金周转率由每年的二点四五次提高到二点六八次，就可以为国家增加收入三万亿元，各个国营商业部门，如果能把占商品总值百分之十五点七五的流转费用减少到百分之十四，也可以相对地为国家增加收入三万亿元。”由此不难了解，国营商业部门降低商品流转费用在为国家工业化积累资金当中所起的作用。
    我们知道，商品流转费用就是把工农业生产出来的商品送达消费者手中所引起的开支，即与商品的收购、运输、保管、包装、整理以及销售等有关的费用。在资本主义制度下，由于经济危机和市场无政府状态，必然造成商品迂回运输、投机倒把和商品推销上的困难，以致在运输保管和广告等方面存在着大量的非生产开支，因此资本主义流通费用水平不断地增长，这是资本主义基本矛盾——生产的社会性与资本主义私人占有制间的矛盾所造成的必然结果。与此相反，在我国由于国营经济在国民经济中居于领导地位，由于我国已有可能有计划地按比例地发展国民经济，国营商业部门就有可能也必须有计划地组织商品的流转，尽力缩减中间环节，消除多余运输，减少储运损耗，使商品能迅速达到消费者之手，这样一来，在我国国营商业中具有大量降低商品流转费的客观可能性。而这种客观可能性也是在不断地增长的。在目前过渡时期中，在小商品生产和私人资本主义工商业存在的条件下，国营商业为领导市场为满足生产和消费者的需要，对于采购调运和销售等方面的费用还不能像苏联社会主义商业那样节省；但随着国民经济中社会主义成份的稳步增长，随着对农业、对手工业和对私营工商业社会主义改造的逐步实现，国营商业降低商品流转费的客观可能性也必然逐渐加大。为了把我们所已具有的降低费用的可能性变为现实性，就必须依靠全体职工的积极性创造性，发掘与动员一切潜在力量，精打细算，厉行节约，为降低流转费用而进行不懈的努力。
      一九五一年十一月间前中央贸易部曾召开第一届全国国营贸易商品流转费用工作会议，制定了编制商品流转费计划及制定商品流转费定额等暂行办法，商品流转费计划工作的建立与开展，对一九五二年节省商品流转费用三万亿元的增产节约运动，发挥很大的推动作用。今年中央商业部所属企业系统又普遍推行经济核算制，改善企业的经营管理，为进一步降低费用创设了条件。由于国营商业部门已加强商品流转费用的计划工作，并开始注意改进业务的经营方法与工作方法，如实行直接调运增加储运容量等等，对商品流转费的节省收到了一定的成绩。但目前在降低商品流转费用工作上还存在不少的缺点，主要表现在商品调运保管上还存在不合理的现象，从而开支过多的运费和保管费用，而由于积压资金所负担的利息支出以及经营管理费用水平在全部商品流转费开支中还占不小的比重。今年上半年有许多企业的实际费用水平都超过了计划定额。费用超支的主要原因就是没有严格执行节约制度，也可以说是还没有很好地贯彻经济核算制。
    经济核算制是实行节约制度的最重要的杠杆。经济核算制要求我们在完成国家计划任务的同时，合理地精打细算地使用人力物力和财力资源，预防并消除一切计划外的损失。因此，每个实行经济核算制的国营商业企业，首先要合理地组织并扩大商品流通与加速资金周转，这是降低商品流转费的重要关键。为此就必须善于研究居民的需要，根据产销情况订立购销合同，有计划地组织商品的运输和调剂工作，及时购进适合消费者需要的商品，这样，才能加速推销，并能避免商品的脱销或积压，提高对生产和消费者服务的质量，同时也必然降低商品的运输和保管费用以及全部流通费用水平。但在扩大推销降低费用的工作中，也必须注意防止下列偏向：譬如为了加速资金周转，避免多负担利息，而压缩库存以致不能保持合理的定额储备，这就不能保证对市场的充分供应，又如只注意完成计划的数量指标，而忽视按品种完成计划，这就会减弱国营商业对市场的领导作用；又如只顾本单位计划的完成，而不重视合同纪律的遵守，不重视对私营工商业的加工、订货和包销的工作，这就必然影响有供销合同联系的其他国营企业计划的完成，同时也不能有步骤地对私营工商业进行社会主义改造。总之，完成计划与贯彻政策必须很好地结合起来。斯大林同志说过：“在生活中，在实践中，政治和经济是分不开的。它们两者一同存在，一同起作用。谁想在我们的实际工作中把经济和政治分开，以减弱政治工作为代价来加强经济工作，或者相反地，以减弱经济工作为代价来加强政治工作，那他就一定要陷入绝境。”〔注一〕这一宝贵指示对国营商业开展的增产节约运动来说也是有重大的意义的。
    其次，为了降低商品流转费，必须依靠广大职工群众的积极性和创造性，使节约费用成为群众性的运动，使每个商业工作人员都能建立正确的节约费用的观点。不能把节省费用与完成业务工作机械地对立起来。有些人认为只要把业务工作做好，多花些钱没有关系，另外有些人又认为国营商业“买卖大”，一星半点的开支算不了什么，这种对节约费用采取漠不关心的态度，是完全错误的，必须及时地予以纠正。莫洛托夫同志说过：“我们应该努力达到，以便使我们的一切工作人员，从下级到上级，永远记住自己对国家和人民的责任，永远记住自己有义务要保护人民财产，谨慎地对待这些财产，遵守支出中的节约制度，和在实际上珍惜人民的每一文钱。”〔注二〕我们知道每个实行经济核算制的国营企业，都由政府拨给一定数量的固定资金和流动资金，做为完成国家计划任务的物质基础，在国营商业企业中有大量的商品物资及其他物质设备，所有这些资金都是全体人民的公共财产，而公共财产又是我们祖国发展生产繁荣经济的主要物质基础，不容许有丝毫侵蚀和浪费的行为。因此，所有商业工作人员对这些财产不仅要保护它的安全，更要合理地运用这些财产，严格遵守节约制度，与一切浪费现象进行斗争。这样，才能增加收益完成利润上缴任务，为国家工业化积累资金。只有从思想上正确认识节约费用的重大意义，才能发掘与动员一切潜在力量，改善经营管理，为增产节约而展开爱国主义的劳动竞赛。斯大林同志指示我们说：“竞赛是在千百万劳动群众最大积极性的基础上的建设社会主义的共产主义方法。”〔注三〕因此，我们必须发挥广大职工的积极性，大力开展竞赛运动，提高商业工作人员的劳动生产率，提高商业工作质量，以扩大购销降低流转费用。
    最后应当指出，为了降低商品流转费还必须加强商品流转费的计划与核算工作。我们知道，制定费用定额是正确编制费用计划的前提，而费用定额也是动员广大职工群众在降低商品流转费用上的奋斗目标，因此，应利用并分析核算上有关费用开支的资料，结合计划期的具体情况，精确地制定费用定额。同时核算指标必须与计划指标相配合，使核算能正确反映费用计划的执行情况，并在计划规定的范围内对各项费用开支进行严格的监督，还须根据核算资料分析和研究费用超支或节约的原因，以便消除缺点和传播在节约费用上的先进经验。加强费用分析工作，对于推动整个商业部门降低商品流转费是有巨大的意义的。
    总之，在国营商业部门中，为了厉行节约降低费用，必须大力贯彻经济核算制，提高经营管理水平。毛主席早就教导我们必须学会做经济工作。因此，我们必须不断地提高政治理论与业务水平，积极学习苏联先进经验，以便能够认识和掌握客观经济法则，领会和实现党和政府的正确政策，为完成和超额完成国家的计划而斗争。
