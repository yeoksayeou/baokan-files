American Fascistization and Popular Resistance
	Robin Hood Blacklisted
	According to a TASS dispatch from November 14th, Mrs. White, head of the Textbook Committee of Indiana, USA, recently submitted a report to the state's education authorities requesting a ban on all textbooks mentioning Robin Hood in schools. Because Robin Hood "robs the rich to help the poor," he is a "communist," and his story cannot be used as teaching material for students.
	Who is Robin Hood? He is a heroic figure in British folklore. After the 13th century, many British writers wrote books about him. This legendary figure is actually feared by McCarthyites. This shows the extent to which the American rulers are suffering from neurasthenia!
	The famous American writer Mark Twain once said before his death that "only the dead have freedom of speech" in the United States. Now it seems that this is clearly an overestimate, because today, not only do the dead not have freedom of speech in the United States (Mark Twain's own works have been banned from publication by the American authorities), but even figures in historical folklore have been placed on the blacklist of American secret agents.
	"Loyalty Investigations" Extend to the "Underworld"
	Currently, McCarthy's "loyalty investigation" movement has expanded from the American "human world" to the "underworld." According to a September 12th report in "World News and Views" weekly, the Texas State Legislature passed a new bill stipulating that the State Education Bureau may not use textbooks whose authors have not undergone so-called "loyalty investigations." The new bill also stipulates that if the author of a textbook has died or is missing, then only if the publisher assures the authorities that the author would have accepted a "loyalty investigation" if he were still alive can the State Education Bureau adopt the textbook. In that case, Jefferson's drafting of the "Declaration of Independence" and Lincoln's famous "Gettysburg Address" obviously cannot be collected in textbooks. What publisher can guarantee to the "book-burning" thugs that Jefferson and Lincoln, if they were alive in the America of today, would accept the insults of these unworthy descendants?
	Workers Have No Freedom at Work
	On December 1st, a new law was added to the American legal code. This law stipulates that dockworkers must undergo a review and be licensed by a special committee of the U.S. government before they can work.
	How is this "review" conducted? People remember that American secret agents once conducted so-called "loyalty investigations" of American teachers. As long as someone had read a progressive novel or had dealings with "suspicious" people, the "loyalty" of the investigated person was immediately considered to have "problems." The investigated person not only had to lose their job immediately, but might even encounter fates more terrifying than unemployment. The "review" that dockworkers now face is a replica of the "loyalty investigation."
	American dockworkers have not yielded to this fascist violence. In New York and New Jersey, work on most docks has been halted due to strikes by workers protesting the "review."
	Spies Have Freedom to Extort Confessions
	U.S. Attorney General Brownell is currently concocting a law to openly abolish the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. The Fifth Amendment formally stipulates that interrogated persons cannot be forced to provide answers that are detrimental to themselves. Brownell's new law is: if anyone invokes the Fifth Amendment and refuses to answer the forced confessions of American secret agents, they will be sentenced to imprisonment for "contempt of court."
	Although Brownell's new law has long fallen behind the actions of American secret agents, with this law, American secret agents will be even more unscrupulous in the future.
	"Stuper Patriot"
	The American reactionary Senator McCarthy's clamoring for war and opposition to the people's evil deeds has been deeply loathed by the American people. Not long ago, an incident occurred in Baltimore, Maryland: Tom Bright, an old car dealer, in order to win voters in the Maryland gubernatorial election, took advantage of the people's hatred of McCarthy and deliberately built a tombstone for McCarthy to show his opposition to McCarthyism. McCarthy's name was written on the tombstone, and the satirical title of "Super Patriot" was added to the name. Soon a "卐" symbol appeared on the tombstone, indicating that McCarthy's "super patriotism" was fascist in nature. Later, someone added a letter to the word "Super," so "Super Patriot" became "Stuper Patriot."

    美国的法西斯化和人民的反抗
    罗宾汉上了黑名单
    据塔斯社十一月十四日电讯报道，美国印第安州教科书委员会的负责人怀特夫人，最近向该州教育当局提出一个报告，要求禁止在学校里采用所有提到罗宾汉这个人的教科书，因为罗宾汉“劫富济穷”，所以他是“共产党”，他的故事不能作为学生们的教材。
    罗宾汉是谁呢？他是英国民间传说中的一个英雄人物，十三世纪以后，许多英国作家把他写成了书。这个传奇式的人物，也居然为麦卡锡党徒们所害怕。这说明美国统治者的神经衰弱到了何等程度！
    美国著名作家马克·吐温生前曾说：在美国“只有死人才能有言论自由”，现在看来，这显然还是一种过高的估计，因为今天美国不仅死人没有言论自由（马克·吐温本人的作品已被美国当局禁止出版），就是连历史上民间传说中的人物，也被列入美国特务们的黑名单了。
    “忠诚调查”扩及“地府”
    目前，麦卡锡的“忠诚调查”运动，已由美国的“人间”扩展到“地府”里去了。据今年九月十二日“世界新闻与评论”周刊的消息：美国得克萨斯州州议会通过一项新法案，规定州教育局不得使用作者未接受所谓“忠诚调查”的教科书。新法案又规定：假如教科书的作者已经逝世或下落不明的话，那么只有该出版商向当局保证，如作者还活在人世，一定会接受“忠诚调查”，州教育局才能采用该教科书。这样的话，显然杰佛逊起草的“独立宣言”和林肯的著名的“盖斯堡演说词”也不能收集在教科书里了。有那一个出版商能向“焚书”的暴徒们保证，杰佛逊和林肯假如活在今日的美国，竟会接受这些不肖子孙的侮辱呢？
    工人工作没有自由
    十二月一日，在美国法典里新添了一条法律。这条法律规定：码头工人必须经过美国政府专门委员会的审查并许可后，才能工作。
    怎样“审查”呢？人们记得，美国特务曾对美国教师进行过所谓“忠诚调查”，只要看过一本进步小说，或是与“可疑”的人有过来往，被调查者的“忠诚”立刻就被认为有了“问题”，被调查者不但要马上失业，甚至还会有比失业更可怕的遭遇。现在码头工人们所面临的“审查”，正是“忠诚调查”的翻版。
    美国码头工人，并没有向这种法西斯的暴力屈服。在纽约和新泽西地方，大部分码头上的工作已因工人们抗议“审查”的罢工而陷于停顿了。
    特务有逼供的自由
    美国政府司法部长布朗纳尔最近正编造一条法律，打算公开废除宪法补正条款的第五款。第五款在形式上规定：不能强制被讯问的人作不利于自己的答复。布朗纳尔的新法律是：如果有谁引证宪法补正条款第五款，拒绝回答美国特务们的逼供，就要以“蔑视法庭罪”被判处徒刑。
    虽然布朗纳尔的这条新法律早已落在美国特务们的行动后面，不过有了这条法律美国特务今后就会更加为所欲为了。
    “混蛋爱国者”
    美国反动参议员麦卡锡叫嚣战争，反对人民的恶行，已为美国人民所深恶痛绝。不久前，美国马利兰州巴尔的摩尔城发生了这样一件事：旧汽车经纪商汤姆·柏莱特为了在马利兰州州长的竞选中争取选民，就利用人民对麦卡锡的痛恨，特意为麦卡锡造了一座墓碑，以表示他是反对麦卡锡主义的。墓碑上写着麦卡锡的名字，并且在名字上加上“超级爱国者”这个讽刺的头衔。很快这座墓碑上就出现了一个“卐”字，说明麦卡锡的“超级爱国”是法西斯型的。随后又有人在“超级”这个字上加了一个字母，于是“超级爱国者”（Super　Patriot）就一变而为“混蛋爱国者”（Stuper　Patriot）了。
