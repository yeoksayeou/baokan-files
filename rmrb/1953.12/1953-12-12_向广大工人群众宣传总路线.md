The broad masses of the working class in our country bear a particularly important responsibility in the great historical task of realizing the general line of the state during the transition period. As everyone knows, the general line of our country during the transition period is to gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the country over a fairly long period, and to gradually realize the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce, so as to build our great motherland into a bright and splendid socialist country. This general line represents the highest interests of the people of the whole country, and first of all, the highest interests of the working class.

For more than 30 years, the working class of our country, through its vanguard, the Communist Party, has led the broad masses of the people to shed blood, sacrifice, and fight heroically for the purpose of realizing socialism in our country. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, our continued hard work to restore and develop the national economy is directly creating a material foundation for socialism. The working class knows that only by realizing socialism can we finally eliminate classes, eliminate the phenomenon of man exploiting man, and enable the working class itself and all working people to live an ideal and happy life.

In order to build socialism in our country, we must first implement the state's socialist industrialization, so that our country will be transformed from an industrially underdeveloped country into an industrially developed country. Because only by building a strong socialist industry can our country be rich and strong, our national defense be consolidated, the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts and private industry and commerce be fully realized, and the lives of the people throughout the country be fundamentally improved. To realize socialist industrialization in our country, on the one hand, we must strive to build many new state-owned factories and mines with socialist characteristics, and on the other hand, we must carry out socialist transformation of capitalist industries. The working class is to undertake the major tasks of building socialist industry and transforming capitalist industry. To realize socialist industrialization in our country, we must first concentrate our main efforts on developing heavy industry, which requires the preparation of a large amount of sufficient funds. However, the newly built heavy industry cannot be put into production in the short term, let alone immediately generate profits for the country. Therefore, in the initial stage of construction, while we must tighten expenditures and increase income in all aspects, it is more important to rely on existing factories and mines to increase production, practice strict economy, reduce costs, and increase profits turned over to the state. This is the main source of socialist accumulation and the most important responsibility of the working class for socialist construction. Only the creative labor of the working class can lay a solid foundation for our country's socialist cause.

The vast masses of workers in our country are highly conscious, and they understand the importance of developing industrial production for national construction. In the past four years, in order to develop our country's industry, the broad masses of workers have displayed great enthusiasm, enabling our country's various major industrial products to quickly recover to and greatly exceed the highest production levels in history. Modern industry has grown significantly, and socialist industry has grown even more dramatically. The proportion of industrial products in our country's national economy has increased from about 10 percent to 28 percent. In modern industry, state-owned industries already account for 50.7 percent. In 1952, the taxes and profits handed over to the state by the employees of state-owned enterprises and cooperative enterprises with their labor income accounted for more than 50 percent of the total state revenue. On the basis of developing production, the wages of employees in state-owned enterprises increased by 60 to 120 percent in 1952 compared with 1949; the wages of employees in private enterprises also increased considerably. Due to the development of industry, the total number of employees in our country has increased from more than 2.4 million in 1948 to more than 15 million in 1952, of which 10.2 million have joined trade unions. That is to say, in the past four years, the working class in our country has not only initially developed industrial production and increased the proportion of socialist economic components in the national economy, but also strengthened its own ranks and improved its own lives, which has created extremely important conditions for the country to gradually transition to socialism.

However, these achievements made by the working class and the people of the whole country are still far from our long-term goals. We have not completely gotten rid of the state of economic backwardness. There are still two ownership systems in our country, that is, in addition to the state-owned economy under the system of ownership by the whole people, there are also a large number of small-private individual economies of farmers and the private economy of capitalism. The individual economy of farmers is scattered and backward, and it cannot free farmers from poverty, nor can it adapt to the country's planned construction. The capitalist economy is a private system based on exploiting the labor of others. Its existence cannot but subject some workers and the vast number of farmers to exploitation by capitalists, and disrupt the country's planned construction with speculative activities. Neither of these two economies has been brought into the orbit of national planning. That is to say, the achievements already made by the working class in our country are not stable enough. The general line of the state during the transition period proposed by the Communist Party is precisely to fundamentally change this situation, continue to develop the socialist components in the national economy, and transform the non-socialist components, in order to finally eliminate exploitation and poverty and completely realize socialism, the great goal of the working class.

The people of the whole country should study and master the general line, and the working class should study and master the general line even more. This is not only because the working class bears the main responsibility for realizing the general line and should give full play to its due exemplary role in this regard; but also because there are still some shortcomings and weaknesses within the working class of our country due to the limitations of various historical conditions, and only by conscientiously studying the general line can we effectively overcome these shortcomings and weaknesses, so that the working class can better shoulder its historical mission.

As everyone knows, the members of the working class in our country are very complex. In the past two or three years, due to the rapid development of the state's industry, a large number of members of small producers and other classes have poured into the ranks of the working class, and these people inevitably bring with them the ideological consciousness and bad habits of the original classes. The working class in our country has long lived surrounded by small private owners and maintains close ties with them, and at the same time, it is in constant contact with the bourgeoisie, which inevitably leads to its being affected and eroded by their bad ideas. The shortcomings and weaknesses such as freedom, laxity, narrow selfishness, guild ideology, and economism that still remain within the working class now, and the bad behaviors of some workers who do not abide by labor discipline, demand excessive living welfare, and even engage in speculative business, purchase land, hoard grain, participate in shares in private industry and commerce, and open shops to become petty bosses, are all the result of the influence of the ideology of the bourgeoisie and small private owners. Before liberation, the broad masses of workers had no political rights at all, and their lives were extremely poor. They could only use methods such as strikes and slowdowns to resist the oppression of the Kuomintang reactionary government, and at the same time, they tried as much as possible to engage in some economic activities other than production to supplement their insufficient wages, which was very natural. However, after liberation, the working class has become the leading class of the country politically, and its life has been basically guaranteed. It is extremely wrong to treat its own country and its own cause with the past attitude. Workers cannot farm the land themselves, and buying land can only be rented out. If this continues to develop, won't they become landlords? Engaging in speculative business and hoarding grain are things done by unscrupulous merchants. How can the working class associate with unscrupulous merchants? Investing in private enterprises and opening shops to become petty bosses means joining the ranks of the exploiters, which is the most dangerous thing for the working class. It is very obvious that the above-mentioned phenomena are absolutely incompatible with the glorious title and long-term cause of the working class and must be completely overcome.

Therefore, in propagating the general line to the masses of workers, we must first explain the consistency of the personal interests of the masses of workers with the interests of the country, clarify the principle that immediate interests should be subordinate to long-term interests, further improve the level of communist consciousness of the masses of workers, and guide the masses of workers to consciously struggle for socialism and for the general line. Some workers in the Shanghai Chongxin Yarn Factory were initially not accustomed to eating standard rice. When the reporter publicized the general line to them, he gave an example: If all the people in Shanghai eat standard rice and save a thin skin of rice, the accumulated funds in one year can be used to open a Chongxin Yarn Factory. The workers were very happy when they heard this and said, "We eat standard rice, which can accelerate the construction of socialism. No problem." There are many such examples in various places, which should be summarized and promoted. On the one hand, we must publicize the great prospects of socialism to the masses of workers, and on the other hand, we must explain to the masses of workers the arduousness of the tasks during the transition period, promote their revolutionary spirit of hard work, and overcome economism. It should be understood that the main part of the fruits of labor created by the working class at present should be used to build socialism, and personal living welfare can only be appropriately improved under the principle of ensuring socialist construction. If we eat and use everything that is produced, how can we expand production? How can we achieve socialist industrialization if we cannot expand production? Therefore, the improvement of workers' lives must not be separated from the basis of production. If the improvement of living standards exceeds the level of production development, it cannot be consolidated, and it will not last long if it is improved, and it will naturally fall in the future.

The immediate interests of the masses of workers must be subordinate to the long-term interests of socialist construction. Therefore, when considering the issue of living standards, we must base it on necessary and possible conditions. The so-called "necessary" refers to things that are both beneficial to production and urgently needed by the majority of workers. For example, the dormitory problem belongs to this category. Last year, the state spent more than 28,000 billion yuan to build dormitories that can accommodate one million people, which proves that the state is very concerned about the living welfare of workers. However, it is obviously wrong to make excessive demands without considering the state's existing strength. The so-called "possible" means that living welfare should be appropriately improved under the condition of ensuring the maximum expansion of reproduction. In the past, the reason why some workers had economistic ideological tendencies was precisely because they had not fully understood the correct relationship between immediate interests and long-term interests, and between improving life and improving production. The reason why this ideological tendency has not been quickly corrected is that some cadres are unwilling to conduct arduous communist education for workers with this kind of thinking, but simply satisfy them in terms of living welfare, which in turn has fostered the erroneous thinking of a few workers with low awareness that "work one day and get one day's pay". We must educate the broad masses of workers with communist ideology and the revolutionary spirit of hard work. The high communist consciousness and revolutionary spirit of hard work of the Soviet people are our best examples. Without this kind of consciousness and revolutionary spirit, socialism cannot be built.

In propagating the general line to the masses of workers, we must also repeatedly explain the importance of the working class mastering modern science and technology and improving their cultural level. In order to realize socialist industrialization, we must build thousands of modern large-scale industrial and mining enterprises, and we must expand and transform the existing factories and mines. Without advanced science and technology and thousands upon thousands of management cadres, technicians, and skilled workers who can master science and technology, this major task cannot be realized. Without science and technology, there is no socialism. Some workers in various places visited the modern giant factories built with the help of Soviet experts in the Northeast and unanimously reflected: "We have never seen such machines, let alone operate them." Doesn't this fully illustrate that our technical level is still very low? Therefore, every employee should strive to improve his technical level and cultural level, learn from Soviet experts, and learn from our country's technical personnel, so that he can quickly become an expert in mastering the latest science and technology and promote the transformation and progress of existing technical personnel. This is an important task that the working class in our country should shoulder during the transition period, and it cannot be ignored.

In propagating the general line to the masses of workers, it is also necessary to clarify the relationship between the daily labor of the masses of workers and the country's socialist construction, and guide the labor enthusiasm of the masses of workers to the current practical actions of increasing production and practicing economy, so that this education can become the driving force for the movement to increase production and practice economy and all construction work. When the state-owned Shanghai Second Cotton Textile Factory publicized the general line to the workers, it first calculated a detailed account: If the doffing time in the spinning room is shortened by only 20 seconds, the entire factory can increase production by 11 pieces of yarn in one month, worth more than 100 million yuan. The workers were very interested when they heard this, and some said: "If we put it this way, whether our production is good or bad is related to the speed of the country's industrialization!" Some said: "In the past, I only knew that socialism was good, but now I know that the realization of socialism depends on our labor." After listening to the publicity, the workers generally felt that they "have a direction", "have a goal", "have a way", and "have confidence". On this basis, the movement to find tricks, tap potential, and improve technical levels to increase production and practice economy immediately achieved good results.

One of the main obstacles to the current in-depth development of the movement to increase production and practice economy is that some cadres and workers still have some conservative ideas. Publicizing the general line to the workers is the most effective way to break conservative ideas and improve production efficiency. People with conservative ideas cannot see their long-term prospects, so they are easily satisfied with the little achievements they have already made and do not continue to pursue progress. The so-called "production has reached the top" and "potential has been exhausted" are concrete manifestations of conservative ideas. We must explain to the masses of workers: Our production will never reach the "top". Although our industrial production has broken through the past level, that is the level of semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism; it is still very, very far from the socialist level! Has the potential been exhausted? Of course not. The Anshan Iron and Steel Small Rolling Mill carried out the automation and mechanization movement, and the labor productivity increased by 41.5 percent, which proves that the potential capacity in the current industrial and mining enterprises is still very large. If all factories and mines across the country can promote this movement, our industrial level can be rapidly improved, which is undoubtedly the case. We must also explain to the broad masses of workers: The working class is the leading class of the country. It should set an example, work actively, unite all the people, and persevere in the struggle to realize the great historical task of the transition period. The working class should further strengthen internal unity. Whether it is old workers, new workers, or technicians, everyone should unite under the goal of the general line. The working class has a particularly important responsibility for further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. The worker-peasant alliance is the foundation for realizing the general line of the state during the transition period. The peasants are the most reliable allies and close friends of the working class, and socialist construction cannot be separated from the efforts and support of the peasants. Therefore, the masses of workers must unite all the peasants well, respect the peasants, help the peasants, satisfy the needs of the peasants with more and better industrial products, and influence and guide the peasants to take the socialist road with their exemplary actions of hard work. A few workers often adopt an incorrect attitude towards the peasants, saying that the peasants are selfish, and being extravagant and flaunting their wealth in their lives; saying that the peasants are backward, and exaggerating their own role and belittling the role of the peasants politically without principle, showing off their power in front of the peasants, and creating a very bad influence on the peasants. Workers produce more wealth for the country, but they should never squander or waste it, let alone boast about anything to the peasants. The contribution of farmers in our country is also large, so it must be fully estimated. Workers should play an exemplary role as a member of the country's leading class, so what is there to be proud of? Shanghai and other regions have launched workers to visit farmers, and welcomed farmers to visit factories, which has played a good role in strengthening the understanding and mutual assistance of workers and peasants. We should carry forward this experience and create more achievements. Employees working in private enterprises should constantly improve their awareness, strengthen unity, strive to increase production and practice economy, and promote capitalists to improve business management and develop production undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood; at the same time, they must supervise capitalists to abide by laws and regulations, conscientiously abide by the policies of benefiting both public and private interests and benefiting both labor and capital, so as to help the Party and the government gradually realize the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce through the road of state capitalism from below.

At present, the general line education for the masses of workers is being actively carried out in various places. It is hoped that all places will sum up all good experiences and promote them. This education must be very extensive. Not only must industrial workers in factories be educated, but also the vast number of workers newly arrived from rural areas must be educated. Not only must workers in large state-owned factories be educated, but also workers in small private factories must be educated. This education must be very in-depth, and we must never relax our meticulous and repeated publicity and explanations because the masses of workers are easily receptive to the education of the general line. We must take this education as a serious step in the self-education of the working class, so that the broad masses of workers can firmly grasp the spirit of the general line and embody it in the practical actions of increasing production and practicing economy, and strive to realize the great task of socialist industrialization.

    向广大工人群众宣传总路线
    我国工人阶级的广大群众，在实现国家过渡时期总路线的伟大历史任务中担负着特殊重要的责任。大家知道，我们国家的过渡时期总路线，是要在一个相当长的时期内，逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，逐步实现对农业、对手工业和对私营工商业的社会主义改造，以便把我们的伟大祖国建设成为光辉灿烂的社会主义国家。这个总路线代表着全国人民最高的利益，首先是工人阶级最高的利益。
    三十多年以来，我国工人阶级经过自己的先锋队共产党，领导广大人民，流血牺牲，英勇奋斗的目的，就是要在我国实现社会主义。中华人民共和国成立以后，我们继续艰苦奋斗，恢复和发展国民经 济，则是直接为社会主义创造物质基础。工人阶级知道，只有实现了社会主义，才能最后消灭阶级，消灭人剥削人的现象，使工人阶级自己和全体劳动人民都过理想的幸福生活。
    为了在我国建成社会主义，首先要实行国家的社会主义工业化，使我国由工业不发达的国家变成工业发达的国家。因为只有建设了强大的社会主义工业，我们的国家才能富强，国防才能巩固，对农业、手工业和私营工商业的社会主义改造才能完全实现，全国人民的生活才能得到根本的改善。要在我国实现社会主义工业化，一方面要努力建设许多新的社会主义性质的国营工厂和矿山，一方面要把资本主义性质的工业加以社会主义的改造。这个建设社会主义工业和改造资本主义工业的重大任务，都是要由工人阶级来担负的。要在我国实现社会主义工业化，还必须首先集中主要力量发展重工业，这就要准备大量的充足的资金。但新建的重工业并不能在短期内投入生产，更不能马上为国家产生利润。因此，在建设初期，我们固然要从各方面紧缩开支，增加收入，但更重要的，则是依靠现有厂矿增加生产，厉行节约，降低成本，增加上缴利润。这是社会主义积累的主要泉源，是工人阶级对于社会主义建设担负的头等重要的责任。只有工人阶级的创造性的劳动，才能给我国的社会主义事业打下坚实的基础。
    我国广大工人群众的觉悟是很高的，他们是懂得发展工业生产对于国家建设的重要意义的。四年以来，为了发展我国的工业，广大工人群众曾经发挥了极大的积极性，使我国各种主要的工业产品，迅速恢复到并且大大超过了历史上最高的生产水平。现代化工业有了显著的增长，社会主义的工业更有了极大的增长。我国工业产品在国民经济中所占的比重，已由大约百分之十达到百分之二十八。在现代化工业中，国营工业已占百分之五十·七。一九五二年国营企业和合作社企业的职工以自己的劳动所得交给国家的税款和利润，占国家总收入的百分之五十以上。在发展生产的基础上，国营企业职工的工资，一九五二年比一九四九年增加了百分之六十到一百二十；私营企业职工的工资也有了相当的增加。由于工业的发展，我国职工总数已由一九四八年的二百四十多万人增加到一九五二年的一千五百多万人，其中一千零二十万人参加了职工会。这就是说，四年以来，我国工人阶级不但初步发展了工业生产，提高了社会主义经济成分在国民经济中的比重，而且壮大了自己的队伍，改善了自己的生活，这就创造了国家能够向社会主义逐步过渡的极为重要的条件。
    但是，工人阶级和全国人民所取得的这些成就，和我们的远大目标比较起来，还是差得很远的。我们还完全没有摆脱经济落后的状况。我们的国家还存在着两种所有制度，即除了全民所有制的国营经济以外，还有大量的农民小私有的个体经济和资本主义的私有经济。农民的个体经济是分散的、落后的，它既不能使农民摆脱贫困，也不能适应国家有计划的建设。而资本主义经济是以剥削别人的劳动为基础的私有制度，它的存在不能不使一部分工人和广大农民受资本家的剥削，并使国家的有计划建设受到投机事业的破坏。这两种经济都还没有纳入国家计划的轨道。这就是说，我国工人阶级已经取得的成就，还是不够稳定的。共产党提出的国家过渡时期的总路线，正是为了从根本上改变这种状况，继续发展国民经济中的社会主义成分，改造非社会主义的成分，以便最后消灭剥削和贫困，彻底实现社会主义这个工人阶级的伟大目的。
    全国人民都应该学习和掌握总路线，工人阶级更应该学习和掌握总路线。这不仅因为工人阶级担负着实现总路线的主要责任，应该在这方面充分发挥应有的模范作用；而且因为我国工人阶级内部，由于各种历史条件的限制，还存在着若干缺点和弱点，只有认真地学习总路线，才能有效地克服这些缺点和弱点，使工人阶级更好地担负起自己的历史使命。
   大家知道，我国工人阶级的成员是很复杂的。近两三年来，由于国家工业的迅速发展，小生产者和其他阶级的成员大量涌到工人阶级的队伍中来，这些人不可免地要带来原有阶级的思想意识和不良习惯。我国工人阶级长期生活在小私有者的包围中，和他们保持着千丝万缕的联系，同时又和资产阶级经常进行各种各样的接触，这就必然受到它们的不良思想的影响和侵蚀。现在工人阶级内部残存着的自由散漫、狭隘自私、行会思想、经济主义等缺点和弱点，某些工人不遵守劳动纪律、过高地要求生活福利、甚至作投机生意、购置土地、囤积粮食、在私营工商业中参加股份、开铺子当小老板等不良行为，都是资产阶级和小私有者的思想影响的结果。解放以前，广大工人群众政治上没有一点权利，生活又是极度的贫困，他们只能采用罢工、怠工等方法反抗国民党反动政府的压迫，同时尽可能经营一些生产以外的经济事业，以补工资之不足，这是非常自然的。但是，解放以后，工人阶级在政治上成为国家的领导阶级，生活也已得到基本的保障，再以过去的态度对待自己的国家和自己的事业，就是极端错误的了。工人自己不能种地，买了土地只能出租，如果发展下去，不是要变成地主了么？作投机生意，囤积粮食，那是奸商干的事，工人阶级怎么能和奸商为伍呢？在私营企业中入股，开铺子当小老板，就是参加了剥削者的队伍，对于工人阶级说来，这是最危险不过的了。非常明显，上述这些现象，和工人阶级的光荣称号与远大事业都是绝不相容的，必须彻底加以克服。
    因此，对工人群众宣传总路线，首先要把工人群众的个人利益和国家利益的一致性说清楚，把眼前利益应该服从长远利益的道理说清楚，进一步提高工人群众共产主义的觉悟水平，引导工人群众自觉地为社会主义、为总路线而奋斗。上海崇信纱厂某些工人，起初还不习惯吃标准米。报告员向他们宣传总路线时，举例说：全上海的人如果都吃标准米，节约米上一点薄皮，一年积累的资金，就可以开办一个崇信纱厂。工人听了非常高兴，都说：“我们吃标准米，能够加速社会主义的建设，没问题。”这样的例子各地都有很多，应该加以总结推广。我们必须一方面向工人群众宣传社会主义的远大前途，一方面向工人群众讲解过渡时期任务的艰巨性，发扬他们的艰苦奋斗的革命精神，克服经济主义思想。应该了解：目前工人阶级所创造的劳动果实，其主要部分应该用来建设社会主义，个人的生活福利，只能在保证社会主义建设的原则下，适当地加以提高。如果我们把生产出来的东西都吃了，都用了，这还怎样扩大生产呢？不能扩大生产，怎样实现社会主义工业化呢？因此，工人生活的提高，一定不能脱离生产的基础。生活水平的提高如果超过了生产发展的水平，那是不能巩固的，提高了也不会长久，将来自然会降下来的。
    工人群众的眼前利益，必须服从社会主义建设的长远利益。因此，考虑生活水平问题，必须根据必要和可能的条件。所谓“必要”，指的是既对生产有好处，又为多数工人所急需。例如宿舍问题，就属于这一类。去年国家支出二万八千多亿元，建筑了能供一百万人居住的宿舍，这证明国家是非常关心工人的生活福利的。但如果不看国家的现有力量，提出过高要求，那就显然错误了。所谓“可能”，就是要在保证最大限度地扩大再生产的条件下，适当地提高生活福利。过去一部分工人所以产生了经济主义的思想倾向，正是因为他们还没有完全懂得眼前利益和长远利益、改善生活和提高生产的正确关系。而这种思想倾向所以没有被迅速纠正，则是由于某些干部不愿意对有这种思想的工人进行艰苦的共产主义的教育，而是单纯在生活福利上去满足他们，结果反而助长了少数觉悟很低的工人“做一天工拿一天工钱”的错误思想。我们必须用共产主义的思想和艰苦奋斗的革命精神来教育广大工人群众，苏联人民的高度共产主义觉悟和艰苦奋斗的革命精神就是我们最好的榜样。没有这种觉悟和革命精神，社会主义是建设不起来的。
    对工人群众宣传总路线，还必须反复说明工人阶级掌握现代科学技术和提高文化水平的重要性。为了实现社会主义工业化，我们必须建设千百个现代化的巨型工矿企业，必须把现有的工厂矿山加以扩充和改建，如果没有先进的科学技术和千千万万能够掌握科学技术的管理干部、技术人员和技术工人，这一重大任务是不可能实现的。没有科学，没有技术，就没有社会主义。各地有些工人到东北参观了苏联专家帮助我们建设的现代化巨型工厂，一致反映：“这样的机器，我们不要说操作它，见都没有见过。”这不是充分地说明了我们的技术水平还很低下么？因此，每一个职工都应该努力提高自己的技术水平和文化水平，向苏联专家学习，向我国的技术人员学习，使自己迅速成为掌握最新的科学技术的行家，并推动现有技术人员的改造和进步。这是我国工人阶级在过渡时期应该担负的一项重要任务，是绝对不能忽视的。
    对工人群众宣传总路线，还要把工人群众的日常劳动和国家的社会主义建设的关系说清楚，把工人群众的劳动热情引向当前增产节约的实际行动中去，使这一教育成为增产节约运动和一切建设工作的动力。国营上海第二棉纺织厂向工人宣传总路线时，首先算了一笔细账：细纱间落纱时间仅仅缩短二十秒钟，全厂一个月就能增产十一件纱，值一亿多元。工人听了极感兴趣，有的说：“这样说起来，我们生产好坏，关系到国家工业化的快慢啦！”有的说：“过去只晓得社会主义好，现在我晓得社会主义的实现要靠我们的劳动了。”工人们听了宣传，普遍感到“有了方向”，“有了奔头”，“有了办法”，“有了信心”。在这个基础上开展找窍门、挖潜力、提高技术水平的增产节约运动，马上获得了良好的结果。
    当前深入开展增产节约运动的主要障碍之一，是部分干部、工人还存在着某些保守思想。向工人宣传总路线，正是打破保守思想、提高生产效率的最有效的办法。有保守思想的人看不到自己的远大前途，因此容易满足于已有的一点成绩，不继续追求进步。所谓“生产到顶”、“潜力挖尽”这一类的说法，就是保守思想的具体表现。我们必须向工人群众说明白：我们的生产永远不会到“顶”的，我们的工业生产虽然突破了过去的水平，但那是半封建、半殖民地的水平；它距离社会主义的水平，还差得很远很远哩！潜力是否挖尽了？当然没有挖尽。鞍钢小型轧钢厂开展了自动化机械化运动，劳动生产率就提高了百分之四十一点五，这证明现在工矿企业中的潜在能力还很大。全国所有的厂矿如果都能推广这种运动，我们的工业水平就能迅速提高，这是毫无疑问的。我们还必须向广大工人群众说明白：工人阶级是国家的领导阶级，它应该以身作则、积极劳动，团结全体人民，为实现过渡时期的伟大历史任务而坚持奋斗。工人阶级应该进一步加强内部的团结，无论老工人、新工人、技术人员，大家都要在总路线的目标下团结起来。工人阶级对于进一步巩固工农联盟负有特别重大的责任。工农联盟是实现国家过渡时期总路线的基础，农民是工人阶级最可靠的同盟军和亲密的朋友，社会主义的建设离不开农民的努力和支持。因此，工人群众要很好地把全体农民团结起来，要尊重农民，帮助农民，以更多更好的工业产品去满足农民的需要，以自己艰苦奋斗的模范行动，去影响和引导农民走社会主义道路。有少数工人常常对农民采取一种不正确的态度，说农民自私，而在生活上对他们讲阔气，耍排场；说农民落后，而在政治上无原则地夸大自己的作用，抹煞农民的作用，在农民面前摆威风，给农民造成了很坏的影响。工人给国家生产的财富较多，但决不应该挥霍、浪费，更不应该对农民夸耀什么。我国农民对国家的贡献同样很大，必须给以足够的估计；工人作为国家的领导阶级的一员，本该发挥应有的模范作用，这有什么可以特别夸耀的呢？上海及其他地区曾经发动工人访问农民，并欢迎农民到工厂参观，对于加强工农的了解和互助起了良好的作用。我们应该发扬这种经验，并且创造出更多的成绩来。在私营企业中工作的职工，更要不断地提高觉悟，加强团结，努力增产节约，并推动资本家改善经营管理，发展有利于国计民生的生产事业；同时要监督资本家奉公守法，切实遵守公私两利和劳资两利的政策，以便从下面帮助党和政府经过国家资本主义的道路，逐步实现对私营工商业的社会主义改造。
    现在各地对工人群众的总路线教育正在积极进行中。希望各地把一切好的经验都总结起来，加以推广。这个教育必须十分广泛，不但要使工厂的产业工人都受到教育，而且要使广大新从农村来的工人受到教育。不但要使大的国营工厂的工人受到教育，而且要使小的私营工厂的工人也都受到教育。这个教育要非常深入，绝对不能因为工人群众易于接受总路线的教育而放松细致、反复的宣传解释。必须把这个教育作为工人阶级自我教育的一个严重步骤，使广大工人都能紧紧掌握总路线的精神，并且把它体现到增产节约的实际行动中去，为实现社会主义工业化的伟大任务而努力。
