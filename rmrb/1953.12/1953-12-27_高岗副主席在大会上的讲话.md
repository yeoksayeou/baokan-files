Comrades, all the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel! Respected distinguished guests!

　　Our country's first mechanized and automated seamless steel tube plant, the first mechanized and automated large-scale rolling mill, and the No. 7 automated blast furnace of the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant are officially put into operation today. On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and our great leader Chairman Mao, I would like to express my warm congratulations on the start of production of the seamless steel tube plant, the large-scale rolling mill, and the No. 7 blast furnace; and extend a warm welcome and heartfelt thanks to the Soviet government delegation headed by Comrade Djevosyan, who came to our country to attend this opening ceremony.

　　The seamless steel tube plant, the large-scale rolling mill, and the No. 7 blast furnace overcame many technical and work difficulties during the construction process, ensured excellent quality, and strived for the highest speed. Today, it is officially put into operation, and its significance is enormous. It marks that our country has achieved a major victory on the road to socialist industrialization, and has opened up a strong forward position for us to strive for greater victories on the industrial construction front in the future. It marks the further development of the friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet people, and this friendly cooperation is based on mutual assistance and a sincere desire to achieve common economic upsurge. The successful construction of these three major projects should be attributed to the great labor and wisdom displayed by all the workers who participated in this construction; to the hard work and specific leadership of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company and the party and government organs and people's organizations in Anshan City; to the efforts and support of people from all walks of life across the country; especially to the selfless assistance of the Soviet government and the enthusiastic work and guidance of Soviet experts. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all the comrades who participated in the construction of the three major projects and to the Soviet government.

　　The seamless steel tube plant, the large-scale rolling mill, and the No. 7 blast furnace are three important projects among the 141 new and rebuilt projects aided by the Soviet Union in our country. These three major projects are huge in scale and complex in technology, so their construction is very arduous. However, with the sincere and selfless technical assistance of the Soviet government, we have quickly built them successfully and are about to begin to play a significant role in our country's industrial construction. This proves that as long as we follow Chairman Mao's instructions, closely rely on the enthusiasm and creativity of the working class, earnestly learn from the experience and advanced technology of Soviet industrial construction, learn from Soviet experts, and with the brotherly and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, we will definitely be able to overcome difficulties and complete our country's task of socialist industrialization.

　　Realizing the socialist industrialization of the country is the highest interest of the people of the whole country. Only socialist industrialization can guarantee the economic prosperity and independence of our country, greatly develop our country's productive forces, further expand the proportion of socialism in the national economy, and on this basis, ensure the smooth socialist transformation of the country's agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce, and ensure the continuous improvement of the material and cultural life of our people. Therefore, the start of the Anshan seamless steel tube plant, the large-scale rolling mill, and the No. 7 blast furnace is not only of great importance to the country's industrialization, but also of great importance to the consolidation of national defense, the development of agriculture and transportation, and the improvement of the entire people's lives. This is why the people of the whole country are working hard to support the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel Company and warmly congratulate the completion of the three major projects of Anshan Iron and Steel. In order to establish the foundation of our country's socialist industrialization, we have determined to carry out 141 new and rebuilt projects with the assistance of the Soviet government during the first five-year plan period. The completion of these projects will bring about tremendous changes in our country's economic outlook and people's living conditions. The working class and the people of the whole country should learn from the construction experience of the seamless steel tube plant, the large-scale rolling mill, and the No. 7 blast furnace to ensure the successful construction of the 141 projects. This is the most important and glorious task of our people at present.

　　The imperialists believe that our country cannot realize national industrialization. They ridicule us, curse us, and say that we can't do this or that, but how can ridicule and curses stop the Chinese people from advancing? We have not only achieved victories in large-scale construction such as the seamless steel tube plant, the large-scale rolling mill, and the No. 7 blast furnace, but we will also achieve victories in construction on an even larger scale.

　　The imperialists are trying to undermine the brotherly unity and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, and are carrying out various despicable conspiracies to provoke discord, but how can such conspiracies stop the continuous consolidation and development of the sincere friendship between the two great countries of China and the Soviet Union? The imperialists certainly do not understand and will never understand that our cooperation is based on mutual assistance and the sincere desire to meet the ever-growing economic, cultural, peaceful, and happy life needs of mankind. The completion of the three major projects in Anshan is one of the shining examples of this cooperation.

　　I hope that the workers of the seamless steel tube plant, the large-scale rolling mill, and the No. 7 blast furnace will continue to work hard and strive to master production technology, improve product quality, and overfulfill the national plan!

　　All the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel, an even greater basic construction task is before us. I hope everyone will make persistent efforts and strive for greater achievements!

　　Long live the great and unbreakable alliance and friendship between China and the Soviet Union!

　　Long live the powerful peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union!

　　Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, we are moving forward along the road of socialist industrialization!

### 高岗副主席在大会上的讲话

    高岗副主席在大会上的讲话亲爱的鞍钢全体职工同志们！敬爱的贵宾同志们！
    我们国家第一座机械化自动化的无缝钢管厂、第一座机械化自动化的大型轧钢厂以及鞍山炼铁厂的第七号自动化炼铁炉今天正式开工了。我代表中国共产党中央委员会、中央人民政府和我们伟大的领袖毛主席对无缝钢管厂、大型轧钢厂和第七号炼铁炉的开工生产，表示热烈的祝贺；并对来到我国参加这个开工典礼的以捷沃西安同志为首的苏联政府代表团表示热烈的欢迎和衷心的感谢。
    无缝钢管厂、大型轧钢厂和第七号炼铁炉，在建设过程中克服了许多技术上和工作上的困难，保证了优等的质量，争取了最高的速度，今天正式开工，它的意义是十分巨大的。它标志着我们国家在社会主义工业化的道路上已取得了重大的胜利，为我们在今后工业建设战线上争取更大的胜利开辟了一个有力的前进阵地。它标志着中苏两国人民的友好合作的进一步发展，这种友好合作的基础是互相帮助和求得共同经济高涨的真诚愿望。这三大工程的建设成功，应归功于参加这一建设的全体职工同志们所发挥的伟大的劳动和智慧；归功于鞍山钢铁公司和鞍山市的党政机关及人民团体的辛勤工作和具体领导；归功于全国各地各阶层人民的努力支援；特别是归功于苏联政府的无私帮助及苏联专家的热忱工作和指导。我谨向参加三大工程建设的全体同志们和苏联政府表示衷心的感谢。
    无缝钢管厂、大型轧钢厂和第七号炼铁炉是属于苏联援助我国新建和改建一百四十一个项目中的三个重要的工程。这三大工程规模是巨大的，技术是复杂的，因而其建设是十分艰巨的。但是在苏联政府真诚无私的技术精湛的援助下面，我们很快地建设成功了，并即将开始在我国工业建设中发挥它的重大作用。这就证明了只要我们遵照毛主席的指示，紧紧依靠工人阶级的积极性和创造性，认真学习苏联工业建设的经验和先进技术，向苏联专家学习，并在苏联兄弟般的无私的援助之下，我们就一定能够克服困难，完成我国社会主义工业化的任务。
    实现国家的社会主义工业化，这是全国人民的最高利益。只有社会主义工业化，才能保证我们国家经济的繁荣和独立，才能大大地发展我国的生产力，才能进一步扩大国民经济中社会主义的比重，并在这个基础上保证顺利地进行国家对农业、手工业和私人工商业的社会主义改造，才能保证我国人民物质文化生活的不断提高。因此，鞍山的无缝钢管厂、大型轧钢厂和第七号炼铁炉的开工，不但对于国家工业化有极大的重要性，对于巩固国防、发展农业和运输业以及对于整个人民生活的改善，也都有极大的重要性。这就是全国人民努力支援鞍山钢铁公司的建设和热烈祝贺鞍钢三大工程完成的原因。为了建立我国社会主义工业化的基础，我们在第一个五年计划期中，已确定在苏联政府的援助下进行一百四十一个项目的新建和改建工程，完成这些项目的建设，将使我国经济面貌和人民生活状况起巨大的变化。全国工人阶级、全国人民应吸取无缝钢管厂、大型轧钢厂和第七号炼铁炉的建设经验，保证一百四十一个项目的建设成功，这是我国人民当前最重要的最光荣的任务。
    帝国主义者认定我国不能实现国家工业化，他们嘲笑我们，诅咒我们，说我们这也不行，那也不行，但是嘲笑和诅咒又怎能阻挡住中国人民前进呢？我们不仅已取得了像无缝钢管厂和大型轧钢厂以及第七号炼铁炉这样大规模建设的胜利，而且必将取得比这规模更大的建设的胜利。
    帝国主义者妄想破坏中苏两国兄弟般的团结和合作，并在进行各种卑鄙的阴谋挑拨，但这种阴谋挑拨又怎能阻挡住中苏两大国家真诚的友谊的不断巩固和发展呢？帝国主义者当然不了解而且永远也不会了解我们这种合作是建立在互相帮助和求得满足人类不断增长的经济的、文化的、和平幸福生活的需要的这一真诚愿望的基础上的。鞍山三大工程的完成，就是这种合作的光辉榜样之一。
    希望无缝钢管厂、大型轧钢厂和第七号炼铁炉的职工同志们继续努力，为掌握生产技术、提高产品质量、超额完成国家计划而奋斗！
    鞍钢的全体职工同志们，更伟大的基本建设任务摆在我们前面，希望大家再接再厉，为争取更大的成就而努力！
    中苏两国伟大的牢不可破的同盟和友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的强大的和平民主阵营万岁！
    在中国共产党的领导下，我们沿着社会主义工业化的道路前进！
