Xinhua News Agency report: Syngman Rhee's group explanation personnel rushed through the explanation work for thirty South Korean POWs in just one morning. None of the South Korean POWs who listened to the explanations applied for repatriation.

Syngman Rhee's explanation personnel continued to use the "hurry up" method for explanations today. They treated the POWs with disgusted expressions. In explanation tent number five, one POW only stayed in the tent for four minutes before the explanation personnel refused to explain to him further. In tent number four, the explanation personnel played a fourteen-minute recording to a POW, but when the POW requested to hear the explanation personnel's own explanation, he didn't say a word and instead asked the chairman of the subsidiary body to take the POW away. During the explanation process, as soon as a POW raised a question about the explanation and asked Syngman Rhee's explanation personnel to answer, they would claim to the chairman of the subsidiary body that the explanation was over and demand that the POW be taken away. The Syngman Rhee explanation personnel in tent number two even started whistling at such times.

Only a few explanations lasted longer. After the Syngman Rhee explanation personnel in tent number three played South Korean music, it evoked a sense of homesickness in one POW. The POW said with deep emotion: "My home is in South Korea, and my parents are also in South Korea. My home, my parents, the trees, green mountains, and rivers of my hometown are all waiting for me to return!" At this point, the POW choked up. Syngman Rhee's explanation personnel immediately became excited and said loudly: "You are our true friend! Your tears are real. Say what you have to say!" However, this POW's tears were entirely brought about by painful memories, and he said: "I left home at the age of eight, begging on the streets barefoot. Before dawn, even the dogs were awakened by me, and the barking of those dogs still frightens me to this day. Why did the Americans come to our land?" At this point, the explanation personnel's face suddenly turned cold, and he hastily told the chairman of the subsidiary body that his explanation was over. Before leaving the tent, this POW told the explanation personnel: "I love my hometown, but I cannot return while my hometown is ruled by you vampires and occupied by the Americans."

In tent number two, the Syngman Rhee explanation personnel said to a POW: "I don't want to pull you back. Why would we want someone like you back!" The POW replied: "I know that if someone like me goes back, you'll just want me to be a soldier. But I'm not that stupid anymore, and I won't be cannon fodder for you again." In tent number three, a POW also said to the explanation personnel: "I was in the labor corps of the US Army's 25th Division. I washed clothes for the Americans and crawled out of trenches under artillery fire to find cigarette butts to smoke." The Syngman Rhee explanation personnel in both of these tents interrupted such statements and asked the chairman of the subsidiary body to take the POWs away.

During the explanation process today, Syngman Rhee's explanation personnel rudely insulted and threatened the POWs. The explanation personnel in tent number five told a POW that "North Korea" started the war. This POW immediately refuted: "That's a lie! I myself participated in the attack on June 25, 1950. It was you people who ordered us to advance north for unification!" The explanation personnel even rudely shouted: "You are in charge of the North Korean POW camp. Get out!" Some Syngman Rhee explanation personnel also threatened the POWs, saying they would be "thrown back into prison." Some Syngman Rhee explanation personnel raised their fists at the POWs. When the explanation work for one POW was completed, the Korean-Chinese side observation representative requested the chairman of the subsidiary body to ask Syngman Rhee's explanation personnel to behave themselves and not to violate the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work." The "Terms of Reference" and "Detailed Rules" stipulate that POWs should not be threatened or insulted. This rude behavior of Syngman Rhee's explanation personnel in violating the "Terms of Reference" is in stark contrast to the situation where the Korean-Chinese side explanation personnel strictly abide by the "Terms of Reference," respect the POWs, and conduct patient and friendly explanations to the POWs.

    九日听解释的美方战俘没有一人申请遣返
    李承晚解释人员恼羞成怒公然辱骂和威胁战俘
    据新华社讯：李承晚集团解释人员九日一个上午就赶完了对三十名南朝鲜战俘进行解释的工作。听取解释的南朝鲜战俘没有一个申请遣返。
    李承晚解释人员今天继续用“赶快”方法进行解释。他们面带着厌恶的表情对待战俘。在第五号解释帐篷，有一个战俘仅在帐篷里停留了四分钟，解释人员就拒绝再对他进行解释。在第四号帐篷，解释人员对一个战俘放了十四分钟录音，战俘要求听解释人员本人解释，他却一句话也不讲，就要求附属机构主席把战俘带走。在解释过程中，战俘刚提出有关解释的问题要李承晚解释人员答复时，他们就向附属机构主席声称解释已经结束，要求把战俘带走。第二号帐篷的李承晚解释人员甚至在这样的时候就吹起口哨来。
    只有少数的解释时间较长。第三号帐篷的李承晚解释人员放送了南朝鲜的音乐以后，引起一个战俘怀念家乡的情绪。战俘满怀深情地说：“我的家在南朝鲜，我的父母也在南朝鲜。我的家乡，我的父母，家乡的树木、青山和河流都在等待我回去！”说到这里这个战俘就哽咽起来。李承晚解释人员马上兴高采烈起来，大声说：“你是我们真正的朋友！你的眼泪是真实的。有什么话快说吧！”但是，这个战俘的眼泪完全是被悲痛的回忆引起来的，他说：“我八岁离开家，光着脚在街头要饭，天还不亮，狗也被我弄醒了，想起那狗的狂吠声，到现在我还害怕。美国人为什么到我们的国土上来呢？”这时解释人员脸色突然冷下来，他慌忙告诉附属机构主席说，他的解释已经结束。这个战俘在离开帐篷以前，告诉解释人员说：“我爱我的家乡，但在我的家乡被你们这些吸血鬼统治着的时候，被美国人占领着的时候，我不能回去。”
      在第二号帐篷里，李承晚解释人员对一个战俘说：“我并不是要拉你回去。你这样的人要你回去干什么！”这个战俘答复说：“我知道，我这样的人回去，你们不过要我当兵罢了。不过我已经不那样愚蠢了，不再给你们当炮灰了。”在第三号帐篷，一个战俘也对解释人员说：“我参加过美军第二十五师的劳工队。我替美国人洗过衣服，在炮弹下爬出战壕找烟屁股吸。”这两个帐篷中的李承晚解释人员都打断了这样的发言，要求附属机构主席把战俘带走。
    李承晚解释人员在今天解释过程中，粗暴地辱骂和威胁战俘。第五号帐篷的解释人员告诉一个战俘说是“北韩”发动了战争。这个战俘立即驳斥说：“这是欺骗！一九五零年六月二十五日我自己参加了进攻。就是你们这些人下令叫我们北进统一的！”解释人员竟粗暴地叫骂道：“你是北边战俘营里负责者。滚蛋！”有些李承晚解释人员还威胁战俘说，他们将被“重新投入监狱”。有的李承晚解释人员向战俘挥起拳头来。朝中方面观察代表在对一个战俘进行解释的工作结束时，提请附属机构主席要求李承晚解释人员规矩些，不再破坏“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”及“解释和访问工作细则”。“职权范围”及“解释和访问工作细则”规定，不得威胁或侮辱战俘。李承晚解释人员这种粗暴破坏“职权范围”的行为，恰与朝中方面解释人员在对战俘进行解释时严格遵守“职权范围”，尊重战俘，对战俘进行耐心的、亲切的解释的情况，成为强烈的对照。
