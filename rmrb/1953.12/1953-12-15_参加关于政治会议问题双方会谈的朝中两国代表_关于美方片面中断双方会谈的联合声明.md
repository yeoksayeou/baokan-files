Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 14th. Joint statement by Ki Sok-bok, representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and Huang Hua, representative of the People's Republic of China, participating in the bilateral talks on the Korean political conference issue, regarding the unilateral interruption of bilateral talks by the U.S. side.

    I. On December 12, 1953, at the 23rd meeting of the bilateral talks on the Korean political conference issue, Mr. Dean, the representative of the United States government, made unwarranted excuses, unilaterally announced an indefinite adjournment, and violently walked out of the meeting, causing the bilateral talks to be interrupted. The North Korean and Chinese sides believe that this unreasonable action by the representative of the United States government was solely intended to sabotage the bilateral talks and refuse consultation, and we hereby lodge a serious protest against this.

    II. The Korean political conference should be an equal conference between the two parties to the Korean Armistice Agreement, and all decisions of the conference must be agreed upon by both parties to be valid. This is the basic principle for convening the political conference. The United States government has long expressed its agreement to this. However, for a long time, the United States government, for its ulterior motives, has violated the principle of equal bilateral meetings and unreasonably insisted that the Soviet Union participate in the political conference of the two parties to the Korean Armistice Agreement as one of the parties to the Korean war, and unreasonably insisted on restricting the authority of the neutral nations participating in the political conference, attempting to make the neutral nations completely ineffective. The representatives of the North Korean and Chinese sides attending the bilateral talks have repeatedly refuted this resolutely. When the representative of the United States government found himself unable to defend his arguments, he violated the principle that all decisions of the political conference must be agreed upon by both parties. In terms of voting procedures, he insisted that each party vote as a unit, so that the United States government could manipulate and monopolize the voting rights of the governments of various countries on the United Nations Command side; on the other hand, he firmly insisted that the seventeen governments participating in the political conference on the United Nations Command side should not be bound by any political conference resolutions to which they themselves did not agree, so that the South Korean government could repeat its criminal acts of violating the prisoner-of-war agreement and plundering North Korean and Chinese prisoners of war to sabotage the armistice agreement once again. There is no doubt that this proposition of the United States government only facilitates the war conspiracies of the warmongers, and therefore seriously endangers the urgent desire of the people of the world to resolve the Korean issue peacefully. In order to clarify the United States government's proposition and its intentions, the North Korean and Chinese sides cited and pointed out the fact that the South Korean government, in mid-June 1953, perfidiously violated the "Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" already signed by the U.S. representative General Harrison, and forcibly detained more than 27,000 of our captured personnel. This was completely necessary and reasonable. Any just person cannot but agree that the North Korean and Chinese sides have every right to make this citation and accusation, and have every right to demand that the United States government clarify its proposition and intentions. However, Mr. Dean, the representative of the United States government, not only refused to clarify the issues raised by the North Korean and Chinese sides, but roared that the North Korean and Chinese sides had "insulted" the United States government, and therefore hastily and unilaterally interrupted the bilateral talks on the political conference issue. Obviously, this action by the representative of the United States government to sabotage the bilateral talks was a premeditated conspiracy.

    III. People should also remember that on June 18, 1953, immediately after the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war was reached, the South Korean Syngman Rhee government, with the connivance of the United States government, perfidiously violated the prisoner-of-war agreement and forcibly detained more than 27,000 of our captured personnel. At that time, General Clark, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command, stated in a letter to the North Korean and Chinese sides on June 29 that "The United Nations Command is continuing its efforts to recover the escaped prisoners of war." But so far, there has been no further development. Later, General Nam Il of our side clearly stated in the "Statement on the US Guarantee of the Implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement" on July 19, 1953: "If, after the armistice, your side is still unable to recover these prisoners of war and hand them over to the neutral nations repatriation commission, our side will reserve the right to submit this issue to the political conference stipulated in Article 60 of the armistice agreement," and the US side has never raised any objection to this. However, now Mr. Dean says that this matter should not be brought up again and that this issue should be erased. In the face of such ironclad facts, we believe that saying that the U.S. side is perfidious is completely in accordance with the facts and there is nothing insulting about it.

    IV. Mr. Dean is not unaware of these facts, but he brazenly interrupted the talks on the pretext that these accusations were "insulting." The arrogant and unreasonable attitude of the representative of the United States government is in sharp contrast to the attitude of the North Korean and Chinese sides of reasoning and consultation. As is well known, at the third meeting of the bilateral talks on October 28, 1953, Mr. Dean brazenly and provocatively slandered the North Korean and Chinese sides as "agents" of the Soviet Union. The representatives of the North Korean and Chinese sides requested at that time and still request the other party to withdraw this purely provocative and insulting remark. However, based on the desire to seek an early convening of the political conference, the representatives of the North Korean and Chinese sides did not unilaterally declare an adjournment for this reason. Now, Mr. Dean, unable to evade his responsibility in the face of the acknowledged fact that the United States government connived with the South Korean government to violate the prisoner-of-war agreement and forcibly detain prisoners of war, is attempting to intimidate and blackmail the North Korean and Chinese sides by means of arrogant roaring and interruption of the talks. This is not only chilling, but also only exposes the strong and unreasonable attitude of the United States government.

    V. The North Korean and Chinese sides have repeatedly pointed out that the purpose of the United States government in delaying the bilateral talks is to try to drag them past the United Nations General Assembly so that the political conference cannot be convened, so that they can take unilateral action to forcibly detain more than 20,000 unexamined North Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. Now, as soon as the United Nations General Assembly closed, the representative of the United States government interrupted the bilateral talks with an unreasonable excuse, thereby sabotaging the convening of the political conference. The truth pointed out by the North Korean and Chinese sides has been fully proven. Now, who is hoping for the early convening of the political conference to discuss issues such as the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, thereby easing the international situation, and who is trying to sabotage the political conference, so that the Korean issue cannot be resolved peacefully, in order to maintain international tension, the peace-loving people of the world are as clear as fire about this. If the United States government still has the slightest regard for the condemnation of the peace-loving people, it should immediately instruct its representative to return to the meeting venue in Panmunjom to resume the bilateral talks. The North Korean and Chinese sides advocate continuing the bilateral talks. Whether the United States government is willing to bear the serious responsibility for sabotaging the convening of the political conference or return to Panmunjom to continue holding the bilateral talks is its own choice.

### 参加关于政治会议问题双方会谈的朝中两国代表  关于美方片面中断双方会谈的联合声明

    参加关于政治会议问题双方会谈的朝中两国代表
    关于美方片面中断双方会谈的联合声明
    【新华社开城十四日电】参加关于政治会议问题双方会谈的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表奇石福和中华人民共和国代表黄华关于美方片面中断双方会谈的联合声明。
    一、一九五三年十二月十二日，在关于朝鲜政治会议问题双方会谈的第二十三次会议上，美国政府代表迪安先生无故制造藉口，片面宣布无限期休会，并横暴地退出会场，致使双方会谈陷于中断。朝中方面认为美国政府代表这一无理行动完全是为了破坏双方会谈并拒绝协商，我们特对此提出严重抗议。
    二、朝鲜政治会议应为朝鲜停战缔约双方对等会议，会议的一切决定必须双方一致同意始能成立。这是政治会议召开的基本原则。美国政府对此早已表示同意。但是，长时期以来，美国政府为了其不可告人的意图，竟违背双方对等会议的原则，无理坚持苏联以朝鲜交战双方中的一方来参加朝鲜停战缔约双方政治会议，并无理坚持限制中立国参加政治会议的权限，企图使中立国完全失去作用。对此，朝中方面出席双方会谈代表已反复予以坚决驳斥。美国政府代表在其理屈辞穷之际，竟又违背政治会议一切决定必须双方一致同意的原则，在表决程序上，一方面坚持每方作为一个单位进行表决，以便美国政府操纵并垄断联合国军方面各国政府的表决权利；另一方面，又坚决主张联合国军方面参加政治会议的十七国政府不能承受其本身所不同意之任何政治会议的决议的约束，以便南朝鲜政府得以重复其破坏战俘协议、劫夺朝中战俘的罪恶行为来再度破坏停战协定。毫无疑问，美国政府这一主张只有便于好战分子的战争阴谋，因而严重危害了全世界人民要求和平解决朝鲜问题的迫切愿望。朝中方面为了澄清美国政府的主张及其意图，曾引证并指斥了南朝鲜政府在一九五三年六月中旬背信弃义地破坏美国代表哈利逊将军已经签字的“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”，强迫扣留二万七千余名我方被俘人员的事实，这是完全必要的、合理的，任何正义人士都不能不同意朝中方面完全有权提出这一引证和指责，并完全有权要求美国政府对它的主张和意图加以澄清。但是美国政府代表迪安先生竟不但拒绝澄清朝中方面所提出的问题，反而咆哮声称朝中方面“侮辱”了美国政府，并因此而匆匆将关于政治会议问题的双方会谈片面中断。显然，美国政府代表这一破坏双方会谈的行动是早有计划的预谋。
    三、人们当还记得，一九五三年六月十八日，在关于战俘遣返问题的协议刚一达成之后，南朝鲜李承晚政府就在美国政府纵容之下，背信弃义地破坏战俘协议，强迫扣留了二万七千余名我方被俘人员。当时联合国军总司令克拉克将军曾在六月二十九日致朝中方面的函件中表示：“联合国军正继续努力以追回已逃亡的战俘”。但是迄今为止，并无下文。后来我方南日大将在一九五三年七月十九日“关于美方保证朝鲜停战协定实施问题的声明”中，曾经明确表示：“如果在停战后，你方尚不能将这批战俘追回交给中立国遣返委员会，我方将保留将这个问题提交停战协定第六十款规定的政治会议讨论”，美方对此亦从未提出异议。可是，现在迪安先生却表示此事不应重提，要把这个问题一笔勾销。在这样铁的事实面前，我们认为，说美方背信弃义，是完全符合事实的，并无什么侮辱之可言。
    四、迪安先生并不是不知道这些事实，但是他却藉口这些指控是“侮辱”，而悍然中断会谈。美国政府代表这种横蛮无理的态度与朝中方面说理协商的态度形成尖锐的对照。如所周知，在一九五三年十月二十八日双方会谈的第三次会议上，迪安先生曾无赖挑衅地诬蔑朝中方面为苏联的“代理人”。朝中代表当时曾经要求并且现在仍然要求对方撤回这种纯粹挑衅的侮辱性的言辞。可是，基于谋求迅速召开政治会议的愿望，朝中代表并未因此片面宣告休会。现在，迪安先生由于在公认的美国政府纵容南朝鲜政府破坏战俘协议、强迫扣留战俘的事实面前，无可闪避其责任，竟希图以横蛮咆哮、中断会谈来对朝中方面进行恐吓和讹诈，这不仅令人为之齿冷，而且只有使美国政府强蛮无理的态度暴露无遗。
    五、朝中方面早已多次指出，美国政府拖延双方会谈，其目的就是企图拖过联合国大会，使政治会议不得召开，以便他们采取片面行动强迫扣留两万余名未听解释的朝中被俘人员。现在联合国大会刚一闭会，美国政府代表就急不暇择地以一个毫无理由的藉口来中断双方会谈，从而破坏政治会议的召开。朝中方面所指出的真理已经得到了完全的证明。现在，究竟是谁在希望迅速召开政治会议，以便讨论从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队、和平解决朝鲜问题等问题，从而缓和国际局势，是谁希图破坏政治会议，使朝鲜问题不得和平解决，以便借此保持国际紧张局势，世界爱好和平人民对此已经明如观火。美国政府如果对于爱好和平人民的谴责还有丝毫顾忌，应该立即指示它的代表回到板门店会场来恢复双方会谈。朝中方面是主张继续双方会谈的。美国政府究竟是甘愿担当破坏政治会议召开的严重责任，还是回到板门店来继续举行双方会谈，应由它自己选择。一九五三年十二月十四日
