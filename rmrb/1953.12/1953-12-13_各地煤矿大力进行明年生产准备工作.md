To guarantee the development of national industry and transportation and to meet the needs of the people's livelihood in 1954, national state-owned coal mines across the country are now actively preparing for next year's production. Mines have already or are strengthening excavation work; improving safety facilities, and conducting major safety inspections; further strengthening planned management, and establishing and improving the responsibility system, to ensure that the coal mining industry will gradually achieve a comprehensive and balanced fulfillment of production tasks next year.

Having learned the lesson of the serious situation of failing to complete the production tasks in the first half of 1953 due to the backwardness of excavation work in 1952, leading cadres at all levels of the national state-owned coal mine system have further clarified the importance of excavation work in coal mine production. Since the launch of the increase production and practice economy movement, leading cadres at all levels have been paying closer attention to excavation work. The Northeast and North China Coal Mining Administrations, as well as the Jixi, Xi'an, Tonghua, Jiaozuo, and North China Mining Bureaus, have successively held excavation professional conferences, established excavation-specific organizations, and personally led by responsible cadres. Some bureaus and mines have improved the excavation wage system and vigorously promoted advanced excavation experiences, initially reversing the situation of insufficient working faces. For example, the Jingxing Mining Bureau promoted the "wide lane false air duct" method in thin coal seams, preparing a lot of coal. The Jingxi Mining Bureau promoted advanced experiences such as the "one-eyed groove pulling, parallel cracking method" in semi-coal and semi-rock excavation, which not only improved the progress but also saved explosives and reduced costs. At present, excavation workers in state-owned coal mines in North China have prepared enough coal for four months of mining in 1954; the Hegang Mining Bureau has prepared enough coal for the first and second quarters of next year, which has created favorable conditions for next year's production and raw coal production increase.

In terms of safe production: this year, especially after the launch of the increase production and practice economy movement, the safe production of coal mines has not only failed to improve but has shown a downward trend. This is mainly because the policy of safe production has not been implemented in actual work, and various safety regulations and systems have not been mastered by the masses. In order to strengthen safe production work, the Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government specifically instructed coal mines across the country to conduct an inspection. Now, many units are conducting a major safety inspection while inspecting the progress of this year's safety measures projects and production maintenance projects, and conducting criticism and self-criticism from the bottom up on the existing problems, seriously inspecting thinking, and taking effective measures to correct actions that violate safety regulations. For example, the Fushun and Jiaozuo Mining Bureaus have strengthened ideological education for grassroots cadres in response to the serious accidents, so that safe production is gradually implemented among the masses. The Coal Mine Management Bureau has also promoted the system of the State Technical Safety Supervision Bureau in key mines such as Fushun and Kailuan, which have achieved many results. In terms of safety equipment, all units have carried out repairs. For example, the Jixi Mining Bureau has started construction to repair and install air ducts, air pumps, winches, main fans, and other safety measures projects. This has laid the foundation for safe production next year.

In terms of strengthening planned management and establishing and improving the responsibility system: the Northeast and North China coal mines have relatively good experience and are continuing to improve. Some coal mines in other regions combine the promotion of operation plans with dispatching work. Bureaus, mines, and pits (wells) are mainly composed of leading cadres responsible for production and engineering personnel in charge to form a whole for directing operations, and have established and improved production meeting systems, shift handover instruction systems, technical responsibility systems, business security responsibility systems, etc., to strengthen the command of the production site.

In addition, mines have attached importance to improving the recovery rate. Hegang Dongshan No. 1 pit has started to excavate new roadways, preparing to implement a new coal mining method of hydraulic sand filling next year. After the implementation of this mining method, the coal recovery rate will be greatly improved compared to the present.

Although coal mines across the country have done a lot of preparatory work for next year's production, it will play a certain role in ensuring the completion of next year's production tasks. However, there are still some problems that must be addressed and solved thoroughly. (1) We must strengthen production geological work, rationally and economically arrange roadways, improve the quality of excavation, implement excavation chart management, and gradually promote excavation mechanization; (2) Resolutely implement the policy of safe production, vigorously strengthen safety education, and strengthen leadership in safety work; (3) At present, the conscientious implementation of planned management in coal mines is not yet universal and not balanced enough, and is generally in the pilot stage. Leading cadres in some units do not pay enough attention to this work, and the plan has not yet penetrated into the masses. Leading cadres in charge of production in some units do not directly control production dispatching work. These must be gradually improved. (4) The quality of coal still fluctuates from time to time. With the gradual improvement of coal mining mechanization and the gradual increase in production, we must strengthen the operation technology of coal preparation and increase coal preparation equipment.

At present, the Coal Mine Management Bureau is holding a meeting in the Northeast, gathering responsible cadres for production technology from coal mines across the country to specifically study how to improve production work technically and in terms of planning, so that coal mine production will achieve greater results next year.

### 各地煤矿大力进行明年生产准备工作

    各地煤矿大力进行明年生产准备工作
    全国国营煤矿为了保证供给一九五四年国家工业、交通的发展和满足人民生活的需要，现正积极为明年生产做准备工作。各矿已经或正在加强掘进工作；改善安全设施，进行保安大检查；进一步加强计划管理，建立与健全责任制，以保证明年煤矿工业逐步做到全面地、均衡地完成生产任务。
    全国国营煤矿系统各级领导干部，接受了由于一九五二年掘进工作落后，造成一九五三年上半年生产任务完不成的严重局面的教训，进一步明确了掘进工作在煤矿生产中的重要性。增产节约运动开展以来，各级领导干部对掘进工作更抓紧了。东北、华北煤矿管理局，鸡西、西安、通化、焦作及华北各矿务局都先后召开了掘进专业会议，成立了掘进专责机构，并由负责干部亲自领导。有的局、矿改善了掘进的工资制度，并大力推广了掘进的先进经验，初步扭转了工作面不足的情况。如井陉矿务局在薄煤层中，推行了“宽巷假风道”的办法，准备了很多煤量。京西矿务局在半煤半岩石掘进中，推广了“独眼拉槽、平行龟裂法”等先进经验，不仅提高了进度，而且节省了火药，降低了成本。目前，华北区各国营煤矿的掘进工人，已为一九五四年准备了足够开采四个月的煤量；鹤岗矿务局已为明年第一、二季度准备了开采的煤量，这些都给明年生产和原煤增产准备了有利条件。
    在安全生产方面：今年下半年特别是增产节约运动开展以后，煤矿安全生产不仅没有改善，反而有下降的趋势，这主要由于安全生产方针还没有贯彻到实际工作中去，各种保安规程、制度还没有被群众所掌握。为加强安全生产工作，中央人民政府燃料工业部煤矿管理总局特指示全国煤矿要进行一次检查。现在，很多单位在检查今年安全措施工程及生产维护工程进度的同时，并进行了安全大检查，对当前存在的问题，自下而上地展开批评与自我批评，认真检查思想，并采取有效措施，纠正违反安全规程的行动。如抚顺、焦作等矿务局针对事故严重的情况，对基层干部加强了思想教育，使安全生产逐渐贯彻到群众中去。煤矿管理总局又在抚顺、开滦等重点矿，推行了国家技术安全监察局的制度，都收到不少效果。在安全设备方面，各单位都已进行检修。如鸡西矿务局已开始动工修理和安装风道、风泵、绞车、主扇风机等各项保安措施工程。这就为明年安全生产打下了基础。
    在加强计划管理、建立和健全责任制方面：东北、华北区各煤矿已有比较好的经验，现正在继续改进。其他各区有些煤矿把推广作业计划和调度工作结合起来，局、矿、坑（井）都以负责生产的主要干部和主管工程人员为主，组成了一个指挥作业的整体，并且建立与健全了生产会议制度，交接班指示制，技术责任制，业务保安责任制等，加强了生产现场的指挥。
    此外，各矿已重视提高回收率。鹤岗东山一坑已动工开凿新的巷道，准备明年实行水砂充填的新采煤法。实行这一采煤法后，煤的回采率将比现在提高很多。
      全国煤矿对明年生产虽已做了不少准备工作，对于保证完成明年生产任务将起到一定的作用。但是还存在着若干问题，必须继续努力，求得彻底解决。（一）必须加强生产地质工作，合理地经济地布置巷道，提高掘进质量，实行掘进图表管理，并逐渐推行掘进机械化；（二）坚决执行安全生产方针，大力加强安全教育，加强对安全工作的领导；（三）目前在煤矿中认真贯彻计划管理还不够普遍和不够平衡，一般都在试点阶段。有的单位领导干部还不重视这一工作，计划还没有深入到群众中去。有的单位负责生产的领导干部不直接掌握生产调度工作。这些都必须逐步改进。（四）煤的质量还有时高时低的现象。在采煤机械化逐渐提高，产量逐渐增加的情况下，必须加强选煤的操作技术，增加选煤设备。
    现在，煤矿管理总局正在东北召开会议，集中全国煤矿生产技术负责干部，具体研究如何从技术上、计划上改进生产工作，使明年煤矿生产取得更大的成绩。
