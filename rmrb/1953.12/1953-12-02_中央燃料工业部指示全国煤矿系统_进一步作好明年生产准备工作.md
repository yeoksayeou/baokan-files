The Central People's Government's Ministry of Fuel Industry recently issued an "Instruction on Further Preparing for Next Year's Coal Mine Production" to the Coal Mine General Bureau, major regional coal mine administrations, and various mining bureaus. Since the launch of the Increase Production and Practice Economy campaign, national state-owned coal mines have exceeded their state plans every month. Cumulatively from January to October, they have completed 101.4 percent of the ten-month production plan and 100.2 percent of the Increase Production and Practice Economy plan, basically reversing the serious situation of underproduction from January to August this year due to insufficient production preparations last year. However, the lagging situation in tunneling work has not been thoroughly improved. Nationwide, only 97.73 percent of the tunneling plan was completed from January to October, and only 72.78 percent of the main roadways were completed. Although some mines have exceeded their tunneling plans, the total length of the working face and the amount of coal obtained have not increased accordingly. From a global perspective, some have obtained a lot of coal, but the distribution among different mines and districts is extremely unbalanced. Production accidents in the coal mine system are still very serious, and there has been an upward trend since October. Frequent transportation and electromechanical accidents have directly affected the uneven progress of production. In addition, some units still have many problems in planning management, dispatching organizations, coal quality, labor organization, and wage systems.

The instruction pointed out: The state requires the national coal mines' production tasks for 1954 to be higher than this year. In order to complete this arduous task, it is necessary to make preparations for the first quarter of next year on the basis of ensuring the completion of this year's Increase Production and Practice Economy tasks. The instruction requires all bureaus and mines to seize the time to carry out the following work: First, continue to implement various decisions to strengthen tunneling work: strengthen the tunneling force; independent tunneling areas; fixed tunneling workers and tools; and appoint a dedicated deputy mine (shaft) director to lead the tunneling work. To do this work well, it is particularly important to focus on the following points: 1. Conscientiously compile tunneling plans and design plans, and require the directors and chief engineers of each bureau and mine to personally preside over the review; ensure that there are sufficient coal mining faces, reserve working faces, and sufficient coal production in the first quarter of next year. 2. The deputy mine (shaft) directors and engineers responsible for tunneling should conscientiously implement the acceptance system to ensure that the roadways meet specifications and quality. 3. Mines whose tunneling tasks are affected by geological changes must appoint dedicated personnel to strengthen geological work, study existing geological data in detail, and use drilling, roadway exploration, and other effective methods to quickly clarify the situation in order to catch up with the needs of tunneling development. 4. Establish and improve the leadership of fast tunneling teams. The national coal mine system has many advanced experiences in tunneling work. Each mine should, according to its specific conditions, absorb the advanced experiences that are effective for the mine, formulate plans, and implement and promote them within a limited area and time to improve tunneling efficiency. Second, improve safety conditions. Safety measures projects and production maintenance projects that have been approved this year must be completed this year. For some mines, the routine year-end maintenance work should be planned immediately, forces should be organized, and implementation should be carried out. Third, each administration should select one or two mining bureaus for pilot projects to formulate a plan for rational adjustment of labor organization next year. And strengthen the employee education to prevent the sudden drop in attendance in the first quarter of each year (especially around the Spring Festival). Fourth, each mining bureau should summarize the experience of planning and management work over the past year in a timely manner, and set requirements for the first quarter of next year. And further strengthen the well (district) level dispatching organizations.

The instruction finally requested that all coal mine administrations, mining bureaus, and mine leading cadres should, in the near future, in conjunction with checking the implementation of this year's plan, conduct a serious study and deployment of next year's production preparation work.

    中央燃料工业部指示全国煤矿系统
    进一步作好明年生产准备工作
    中央人民政府燃料工业部，最近向煤矿总局和各大区煤矿管理局、各矿务局发出了关于“为进一步作好明年煤矿生产准备工作的指示。”自增产节约运动开展后，全国国营煤矿都按月超额完成了国家计划。一至十月累计，已完成十个月生产计划的百分之一百零一点四，完成增产节约计划的百分之一百点二，基本上扭转了由于去年生产准备不足而造成的今年一至八月欠产的严重局面。但是，掘进工作落后的情况还没有彻底好转，以全国计，一月至十月份只完成掘进计划的百分之九十七点七三，主要巷道只完成百分之七十二点七八。其中有的矿虽然超额完成了掘进计划，但工作面总长度及获得煤量还没有相应地增加；有的从全局来看，获得煤量不少，但分矿分区又极不平衡。煤矿系统生产事故还很严重，特别是十月份以来，又有上升趋势。由于运输和机电事故的频繁，更直接影响生产不能均衡进行。另外，有些单位在计划管理、调度机构、煤炭的质量、劳动组织、工资制度等方面都还存在不少问题。
    指示指出：一九五四年国家要求全国煤矿的生产任务比今年提高了，为了完成这一艰巨的任务，就必须在保证完成今年增产节约任务的基础上，作好明年第一季度的准备工作。指示要求各局、矿要争取时间进行以下工作：第一，继续贯彻加强掘进工作的各项决定：壮大掘进力量；独立掘进区；固定掘进工人和工具；指定专责副矿（井）长领导掘进工作。为作好这一项工作，特别要抓紧下列几点：一、切实编制掘进计划和设计计划，并要求各局、矿长及主任工程师亲自主持审核；保证明年第一季度有足够的采煤工作面、预备工作面和足够的获得煤量。二、负掘进专责的副矿（井）长及工程师应切实负责严格执行验收制度，保证巷道合乎规格、质量。三、某些因地质变化而影响掘进任务的矿井，必须指定专责人员加强地质工作，详细研究现有地质资料，采用钻探、巷探及其他有效方法，迅速弄清情况，以便赶上掘进发展的需要。四、建立与健全快速掘进队的领导。全国煤矿系统掘进工作的先进经验很多，各矿应根据本矿的具体条件，吸收对本矿行之有效的先进经验，拟订计划，限区限期贯彻推广，提高掘进效率。第二，改善安全情况。今年已批准的安全措施工程及生产维持工程，务必于今年内完成。有些矿山照例的年关检修维护工作，应立即拟订计划，组织力量，贯彻执行。第三，各管理局应选定一两个矿务局进行试点，制定明年的合理调整劳动组织的方案。并加强职工教育工作，以防止历年第一季度内（特别是春节前后）出勤率突然降低的现象。第四，各矿务局及时总结一年来计划管理工作的经验，定出明年第一季度的要求。并进一步加强井（区）级调度机构。
    指示最后要求各煤矿管理局、各矿务局以及各矿领导干部，都应在最近期间，结合检查今年计划执行情况，对明年的生产准备工作进行一次认真的研究和布置。
