Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 25th: Today is the second day that the explanation work on the Korean-Chinese side has been forcibly halted. This morning, the Korean-Chinese side continued to submit to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission the explanation work plan for the 26th, requesting that explanations be given to the 250 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war in Camp No. 4 who have not yet received explanations. According to our returning personnel, a large number of prisoners of war under the U.S. side's special agent terrorist rule are anxiously waiting to hear the explanations so that they can exercise their right to be repatriated. The fact that 232 of our prisoners of war risked their lives to climb out of the barbed wire to apply for repatriation, and that 137 of our prisoners of war broke through the special agent terrorist rule to apply for repatriation when they listened to the explanations, has fully proven this point.
	The "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" stipulates that the side to which the prisoners of war belong has the freedom and convenience to continuously provide explanations to the prisoners of war for ninety days, thereby ensuring that the prisoners of war have the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated. Therefore, the U.S. side's unilateral demand to stop the explanations and opposition to making up the ninety-day explanation period deprives the prisoners of war of the opportunity to hear the explanations and apply for repatriation, seriously violating the spirit of the "Terms of Reference" and undermining the basis of the "Terms of Reference"—explanation.

    十二月二十五日我方解释工作又被迫停顿
    我方再向中立国遣返委员会提出解释计划
   【新华社开城二十五日电】今天是朝中方面解释工作被迫停顿的第二天。朝中方面今天上午继续向中立国遣返委员会提出二十六日的解释工作计划，要求对第四号营场的未听解释的二百五十名中国人民志愿军被俘人员进行解释。据我方归来人员说，在美方特务恐怖统治下的大批战俘正在急切地等待听取解释，以便行使他们被遣返的权利。二百三十二名我方被俘人员冒着生命危险爬出铁丝网申请遣返，和一百三十七名我方被俘人员在听取解释时突破特务恐怖统治申请遣返，已充分地证明了这一点。
    “中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”规定：战俘所属一方有自由与便利向战俘不间断地进行九十天的解释，从而保证战俘有机会行使其被遣返的权利。因此，美方片面要求停止解释和反对补足九十天的解释期限，剥夺战俘听取解释和申请遣返的机会，严重地违反了“职权范围”的精神，破坏了
  “职权范围”的基础——解释。
