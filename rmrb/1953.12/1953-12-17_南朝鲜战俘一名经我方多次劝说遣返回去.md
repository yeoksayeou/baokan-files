Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 16th – As the US side continues to refuse to grant American and British prisoners of war and South Korean prisoners of war the opportunity to hear full explanations and refuses to guarantee the right of prisoners of war to return home and live peaceful lives, explanation work at Songgok-ri continues to be stalled today. At the same time, because US special agents oppose segregation and prevent Korean and Chinese prisoners of war from leaving the camp to listen to explanations, explanation work in Dongchang-ri has been forced to stop for a full month.

This afternoon, a South Korean prisoner of war, Kim Moon-doo, who applied for repatriation, was handed over to the US side by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. When Kim Moon-doo walked out of the Songgok-ri camp this morning to request to return home to the guard troops, the other prisoners of war were very quiet and there was no shouting. An Indian spokesman said: When this prisoner of war requested repatriation, "there was no beating or any violent action in the camp. The prisoner of war quietly walked out of the gate."

Article 9 of the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visitation Work" of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission stipulates that prisoners of war may apply for repatriation at any time and in any place. This clause has been fully implemented in Songgok-ri. In Dongchang-ri, US special agents have completely undermined this regulation of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. Special agents are implementing a bloody reign of terror in the prisoner of war camp, preventing prisoners of war from requesting repatriation. Korean and Chinese prisoners of war can only risk their lives to climb over the barbed wire and escape to get the opportunity to apply for repatriation.

In accordance with the consistent policy of repatriating all prisoners of war, the Korean and Chinese side has persuaded Kim Moon-doo four times in the past to return home and live a peaceful life. Before handing him over to the custody of the neutral nations, the Korean and Chinese side once again told him that he could apply for repatriation at any time and anywhere in the neutral nations' custody camp. This is also in sharp contrast to the US side's actions of not allowing Korean and Chinese prisoners of war to know that they have the right to apply for repatriation, and using various brutal means to kill prisoners of war who express their desire to return home.

### 南朝鲜战俘一名经我方多次劝说遣返回去

    南朝鲜战俘一名经我方多次劝说遣返回去
    【新华社开城十六日电】由于美方继续拒绝给予美英战俘和南朝鲜战俘以听取充分解释的机会和拒绝保证战俘回家过和平生活的权利，今天松谷里解释工作继续陷于停顿。同时，由于美方特务反对隔离和阻止朝中战俘出营场听取解释，东场里解释工作被迫停顿已经整整一个月了。
    今天下午，一名申请遣返的南朝鲜战俘金文斗由中立国遣返委员会交给美方。金文斗在今天早晨走出松谷里的营场向看管部队要求回家时，其他战俘都很安静，没有任何叫嚷。一位印度发言人说：当这名战俘要求遣返时，营场内“没有发生殴打和任何暴力行动。这名战俘静静地走出了大门。”
    中立国遣返委员会的“解释和访问工作细则”第九款规定，战俘可以在任何时间与任何地点申请遣返。这一条款在松谷里完全实现了。而在东场里，美方特务彻底破坏了中立国遣返委员会的这项规定，特务们在战俘营场中实行着阻止战俘要求遣返的血腥恐怖统治，朝中战俘只有冒着生命危险翻过铁丝网逃出来，才能得到申请遣返的机会。
    朝中方面根据一贯的遣返全部战俘的政策，过去曾四次劝说金文斗回家过和平生活。在移交给中立国看管以前，朝中方面还再一次告诉他，在中立国看管营场随时随地都可以申请遣返。这也与美方根本不让朝中战俘知道他们有申请遣返的权利，并使用各种残暴手段杀害表露要求回家愿望的战俘的行动，成为强烈的对照。
