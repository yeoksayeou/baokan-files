(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 26th) Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho, Chief Commissioner on the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers side of the Military Armistice Commission, recently issued the following statement regarding the neutral nations repatriation commission majority members' irrational decision to terminate the explanation work on December 23, 1953:

	I. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission communiqué of December 24, 1953, stated that the majority of the commission members, namely, the Indian, Swedish, and Swiss members, decided that "from December 24th onward, the commission will not allow explanation representatives to contact prisoners of war for explanations." The Polish and Czechoslovak members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission pointed out that, according to Clause 8 of the "Terms of Reference," the commission is responsible for providing freedom and convenience for explanation representatives from both sides to continuously conduct explanation work throughout the ninety-day period. It is universally known that this prerequisite provision has not been achieved. Therefore, the Polish and Czechoslovak members firmly maintained that the explanation work must continue in the prisoner of war camps in both the North and the South to make up for the ninety-day period. However, this reasonable proposal of the Polish and Czechoslovak members was rejected by the Indian, Swedish, and Swiss members, resulting in the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission refusing the Korean-Chinese side's plan to provide explanations to unexplained prisoners of war on December 24th, 25th, and 26th. We believe that this decision by the majority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission members is a complete violation of the spirit and substance of the "Terms of Reference."

	II. The entire spirit of the "Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's Terms of Reference" lies in ensuring that the side to which the prisoners of war belong has the freedom and convenience to conduct explanations to the prisoners of war for ninety days, so that all prisoners of war have the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated after listening to the explanations. To this end, Clause 8 of the "Terms of Reference" clearly stipulates that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission shall immediately make arrangements after taking over all prisoners of war, so that the country to which the prisoners of war belong has the freedom and convenience to provide explanations to all prisoners of war attached to that country within ninety days from the date the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission takes over. According to the above provisions of the "Terms of Reference," the explanation work should have started on September 25, 1953, the date the commission took over, and continued uninterruptedly until December 23, 1953, to ensure the full ninety days of explanation time to which the side to which the prisoners of war belong is entitled. Only in this way can the termination of the explanation work be announced on December 23, 1953. But the fact is that due to the obstruction of the US side, the explanation work not only did not start on September 25, 1953, but started on October 15, 1953, and has never been able to proceed uninterruptedly due to the obstruction of the US side. From October 15th to December 23rd, the Korean-Chinese side only conducted ten days of explanation work. Therefore, the majority of neutral countries on the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission had no reason to announce the termination of the explanation work on December 23, 1953.

	III. After the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission took over the prisoners of war, the US side immediately delayed the construction of the explanation camp, putting forward the absurd time required for construction, claiming that it would take four weeks to build the explanation facilities that could be completed within four days. The Korean-Chinese side repeatedly proposed to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission that the Korean-Chinese side build the explanation camp itself and guaranteed that it would be completed within four days. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission did not agree to this request from the Korean-Chinese side. Although the US side finally withdrew its original absurd time required for construction under the strong demands of the Korean-Chinese side, it had already delayed the explanation work that should have started on September 25th until October 15th, depriving the Korean-Chinese side of twenty days of explanation time. Since the Korean-Chinese side began its explanation work, due to the US side directing its Chiang and Rhee agents to prevent the Korean-Chinese prisoners of war from attending the explanations and resisting the provisions for isolating prisoners of war, and the majority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission members failing to take effective measures to break the agents' control over the prisoners of war and delaying the arrangement for isolating the prisoners of war, the explanation work of the Korean-Chinese side was interrupted five times from October 15th to December 20th, losing sixty days of explanation time. Finally, thanks to the repeated efforts of the Korean-Chinese side, the explanation work resumed on December 21st. But only three days after the resumption, the majority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission members unreasonably decided to terminate the explanation work, leaving the Korean-Chinese side with only ten days of explanation work in the ninety-day period from September 25, 1953, to December 23rd. This situation is clearly intolerable.

	IV. The majority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, namely, the Indian, Swedish, and Swiss members, claimed that Clause 11 of the "Terms of Reference" stipulates that "Upon the expiration of the ninety (90) days period after the transfer of custody of the prisoners of war to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Committee, the representatives specified in paragraph 8 above shall be precluded from access to them;" because this provision is mandatory, the commission has no right to allow the continuation of the explanation work. This statement is clearly an attempt to sever the relevant provisions of the "Terms of Reference," sophistry and completely untenable. Everyone knows that the relevant provisions of the "Terms of Reference" are an interconnected whole and cannot be severed. The provisions of Clause 11 of the "Terms of Reference" are obviously premised on the implementation of other clauses of the "Terms of Reference," especially Clause 8. One cannot help but ask, under the circumstances that the basic clauses of the "Terms of Reference" have been thoroughly undermined by the US side, and the commission has consistently failed to take effective measures to ensure the implementation of the "Terms of Reference" due to the opposition of the majority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission members, thus the premise of Clause 11 of the "Terms of Reference" has been completely destroyed, what reason does the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission have to announce the termination of the explanation work? Are other clauses of the "Terms of Reference" not mandatory? Does the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission have the right to postpone the explanation work for as long as twenty days, have the right to sit idly by while the US side undermines the explanation work for as long as sixty days, have the right to sit idly by while more than 85 percent of the nearly 20,000 Korean-Chinese prisoners of war are unable to listen to the explanations at all, but have no right to ensure the full ninety days of explanation work in accordance with the provisions of Clause 8 of the "Terms of Reference"? As early as September 24th, when the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission anticipated that the explanation arrangements and equipment could not be fully prepared for a while, it unanimously advocated that the loss of explanation time should be compensated. But under the circumstances that the US side has interrupted the explanation work for a long time, so that the Korean-Chinese side has only been able to conduct ten days of explanation work so far, and the explanation work has just been resumed due to the efforts of the Korean-Chinese side, the majority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission members not only did not insist on the just proposition of compensating for the loss of explanation time, but unreasonably announced the termination of the explanation work. This is clearly completely incompatible with the neutral countries' position of upholding justice.

	V. The Korean-Chinese side believes that the decision of the majority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission members to terminate the explanation work is completely unreasonable and a serious violation of the "Terms of Reference." The Korean-Chinese side has made a firm demand to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to continue the explanation work and make up for the ninety-day explanation period. The Korean-Chinese side awaits the specific reply from the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.

    李相朝就解释工作被迫终止问题发表谈话
    重申应补足解释期限的合理主张
    并斥责中立国遣返委员会多数委员的无理决定
    【新华社开城二十六日电】军事停战委员会朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军方面首席委员李相朝中将，顷就中立国遣返委员会多数委员无理决定解释工作于一九五三年十二月二十三日终止事，发表谈话如下：
    一、一九五三年十二月二十四日中立国遣返委员会公报称，委员会的多数委员，即印度、瑞典、瑞士的委员决定“自十二月二十四日起委员会将不能允许解释代表为进行解释而与战俘接触”。中立国遣返委员会的波兰、捷克斯洛伐克委员指出按照
  “职权范围”第八款，委员会负有责任为双方解释代表在九十天的整个期间提供自由与便利不断进行解释工作，举世皆知此项前提规定并未获得实现，因此波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员坚决主张解释工作必须在南北两战俘营营地继续进行，以补足九十天的期限。但波兰、捷克斯洛伐克委员的这一合理主张为印度、瑞典、瑞士的委员所否决，以致朝中方面在十二月二十四日、二十五日和二十六日向未经解释的战俘进行解释的计划也遭中立国遣返委员会所拒绝。我们认为中立国遣返委员会多数委员的这一决定是完全违反“职权范围”的精神和实质的。
    二、“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的整个精神在于保证战俘所属一方有自由与便利向战俘进行九十天的解释，使全部战俘在听取解释后有机会行使其被遣返的权利。为此，“职权范围”第八款明确规定，中立国遣返委员会在接管全部战俘之后应立即进行安排，使战俘所属国家有自由与便利在自中立国遣返委员会接管之日起的九十天内，向一切依附于该所属国家的战俘进行解释。根据“职权范围”的上述规定，解释工作应在委员会接管之日即一九五三年九月二十五日开始，并自此不中断地进行到一九五三年十二月二十三日，以保证战俘所属一方所应有的九十整天的解释时间。只有这样，才能在一九五三年十二月二十三日宣布解释工作的终止。但事实是由于美方的破坏，解释工作既未能在一九五三年九月二十五日开始，而在一九五三年十月十五日开始了，且又由于美方的破坏，从未能不间断的进行。从十月十五日至十二月二十三日，朝中方面只进行了十天的解释工作。因此，中立国遣返委员会的多数中立国家没有任何理由在一九五三年十二月二十三日宣布解释工作的终止。
    三、在中立国遣返委员会接管战俘后，美方即行拖延解释营场的修建，提出荒谬的修建所需时间，声称需要四星期的时间来修建在四天之内完全可以修好的解释设备。朝中方面曾一再向中立国遣返委员会提出由朝中方面自行修建解释营场，并保证在四天之内予以完成。中立国遣返委员会并未同意朝中方面的这一要求，虽然在朝中方面的力争下，美方终于收回了其原所提出的荒谬的修建所需时间，但已使本应在九月二十五日开始的解释工作推迟到了十月十五日，剥夺了朝中方面二十天的解释时间。自从朝中方面解释工作开始以后，由于美方指使其蒋、李特务不让朝中被俘人员出席听取解释，并抗拒隔离战俘的规定，而中立国遣返委员会的多数委员又未采取有效措施，打破特务对战俘的控制，延不进行隔离战俘的安排，以致朝中方面的解释工作从十月十五日至十二月二十日的期间遭受了五次中断，损失了六十天的解释期限。最后，由于朝中方面的一再努力，解释工作在十二月二十一日恢复了。但才恢复三天，中立国遣返委员会的多数委员竟又无理决定终止解释工作，使朝中方面在
  一九五三年九月二十五日到十二月二十三日的九十天时间中，仅能进行十天的解释工作。这种状况显然是不能容忍的。
    四、中立国遣返委员会的多数，即印度、瑞典、瑞士的委员声称，“职权范围”第十一款规定“战俘的看管移交中立国遣返委员会九十天期满后，上述第八款中所规定的代表们对战俘的接触应即终止”；由于这一规定是有强制性的，因此委员会无权允许解释工作的继续进行。这种说法显然是企图割裂“职权范围”的有关规定，强词夺理完全站不住脚的。谁都知道“职权范围”的有关规定是一个互相关联的整体，不容加以割裂的。“职权范围”第十一款的规定显然是以“职权范围”其他各项条款，特别是第八款的实施为其前提的。人们不能不问，在“职权范围”的各项基本条款已被美方所彻底破坏，而由于中立国遣返委员会的多数委员的反对，委员会始终未能采取有效措施保证“职权范围”的实施，因之“职权范围”第十一款的前提已被破坏无遗的情况下，中立国遣返委员会有什么理由宣布解释工作的终止？难道“职权范围”的其他条款是没有强制性的吗？难道中立国遣返委员会有权推迟解释工作达二十天之久，有权坐视美方破坏解释工作达六十天之久，有权坐视百分之八十五以上的将近两万名的朝中被俘人员根本不能听取解释，而却无权按照“职权范围”第八款的规定保证九十整天的解释工作吗？早在九月二十四日当中立国遣返委员会预计解释安排与设备一时不能准备完竣时，曾一致主张解释时间的损失应予补足。但在美方长期地中断了解释工作，以致朝中方面的解释工作迄今只能进行十天，而解释工作又刚刚由于朝中方面的努力而得以恢复的情况下，中立国遣返委员会的多数委员却不但未坚持补足解释时间的损失的公正主张，反而无理宣布解释工作的终止。这显然是和中立国主持公道的正义立场完全不相容的。
    五、朝中方面认为中立国遣返委员会多数委员终止解释工作的决定是完全不合理的，是严重违反
  “职权范围”的，朝中方面已向中立国遣返委员会提出了继续进行解释工作，补足九十天解释期限的坚决要求。朝中方面等待中立国遣返委员会的具体答复。
