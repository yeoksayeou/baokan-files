To meet the needs of people's production and life and to accumulate funds for the country, the factories under the Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Industry, in conjunction with the preparation of the 1954 plan, organized cadres to study the general line of the state during the transition period. According to the tasks of local industry in the national industrialization, all factories paid attention to improving product quality and reducing costs in the preparation of the plan.

The Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Industry pointed out at the meeting on arranging the preparation of the 1954 national economic plan on November 13 that it is necessary to correctly compile the production, technology, and financial plans for 1954 based on the general line and general tasks of our country in the transition period and the basic tasks of the first five-year construction plan, as well as the implementation of this year's plan. In the preparation, each factory should prevent the tendency of being greedy and rash in the basic construction plan and starting everything from scratch, and oppose conservative ideas in the production, financial, and cost plans. We must give full play to the initiative and potential of local industry to support industrial construction, based on the principle of combining supply, production, and sales, based on the needs of the people in production and life, and based on needs and possibilities. The Provincial Department of Finance also held a provincial enterprise finance conference to arrange the preparation of next year's financial plan. It required all local state-owned factories to vigorously reduce costs. In 1954, the cost reduction of provincial local state-owned factories should be 6.77% lower than in 1953; the cost reduction of municipal and county local state-owned factories should be 4% as the minimum requirement. Labor productivity should be 29% higher than in 1953. The turnover period of working capital should be accelerated by another ten days compared with the actual completion turnover period of each factory in 1953.

Now, the factories have begun to take action. For example, the Heilongjiang Soap Factory, combined with the study of the general line, checked the low quality and high cost of the factory, and put forward requirements for reducing costs. The Heilongjiang Tannery paid attention to the improvement of shoe styles and the improvement of durability. The Knitting, Dyeing and Finishing Factory is improving the hot air dryer for flannel to make it automatic. After success, it can not only improve the capacity of the dryer, but also improve the quality and reduce rework.

    黑龙江省工业厅所属各厂编制明年计划
    黑龙江省工业厅所属各厂结合编制一九五四年计划，组织干部学习了国家在过渡时期的总路线，根据地方工业在国家工业化中的任务，各厂在编制计划中都注意了提高产品质量和降低成本工作，以满足人民生产和生活的需要，给国家积累资金。
    该省工业厅在十一月十三日布置编制一九五四年国民经济计划会议上指出：必须根据我国在过渡时期的总路线、总任务和第一个五年建设计划的基本任务，以及根据今年计划执行情况，正确地编制一九五四年的生产、技术、财务计划；各厂应根据国家的各项控制数字，结合本厂实际情况，充分发挥设备能力，在编制中，应防止基本建设计划的贪多冒进，百废俱兴的偏向；在生产、财务和成本计划上要反对保守思想。要根据供产销相结合的原则，根据人民群众在生产上和生活上的需要，根据需要和可能，发挥地方工业的积极性和潜在力，支援工业建设。省财政厅也召开了全省企业财务会议，布置编制明年财务计划工作，要求各地方国营工厂要大力降低成本，一九五四年比一九五三年省地方国营工厂要降低成本百分之六点七七；市、县地方国营工厂降低百分之四为最低要求。劳动生产率要比一九五三年提高百分之二十九。流动资金应比一九五三年各厂实际完成周转期再加快十天。
    现在，各厂已开始行动。如黑龙江肥皂厂，结合学习总路线，检查了该厂质量低、成本高的情况，提出了降低成本的要求。黑龙江制革厂注意了皮鞋样式的改进和提高耐用年限。针织染整厂正在改进绒布的热风干燥机，使其自动化，成功后不仅可以提高干燥机的能力，同时可以提高质量，减少返修品。
