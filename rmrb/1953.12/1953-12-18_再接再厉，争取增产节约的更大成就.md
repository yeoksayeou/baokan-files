With the efforts of Party and government organs at all levels, leading cadres, and all staff and workers, the movement to increase production and practice economy, which began nationwide in September of this year, has achieved remarkable results.

In terms of industrial production, the total output value plans for the five departments of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Ministry of Fuel Industry, the First Ministry of Machine Building, the Ministry of Light Industry, and the Ministry of Textile Industry were all overfulfilled in September, October, and November. Among the 24 major products, 19 overfulfilled their plans in September, 15 overfulfilled their plans in October, and 20 fulfilled or overfulfilled their plans in November. Some factories and mines have already completed their 1953 plans ahead of schedule, and it is expected that most products will complete or overfulfill the state plan by the end of the year. The quality of some products has improved, costs have been reduced, and the level of enterprise management has improved to a certain extent. On the basis of increased production, the central ministries' plans for remitting enterprise profits will not only be guaranteed to be completed by the end of the year, but will also be exceeded. Local state-owned industrial enterprises operated by major regions and provinces have also improved in production and increased profits.

In terms of capital construction, most construction sites have launched labor emulation drives, and construction progress has accelerated significantly since September, with quality improvements. According to the State Statistical Bureau, the five central industrial ministries completed an average of 14.4 percent of the annual investment plan in September, 13.6 percent in October, and progress was also faster in November. Many important construction units have also proposed to complete projects ahead of schedule while ensuring project quality. The seamless steel tube plant and large-scale rolling mill of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, which are of great significance to China's industrial construction, have been completed, and the No. 7 blast furnace can also be completed as scheduled. If all regions work harder, this year's capital construction plan may be completed more and better than originally expected.

In terms of commodity circulation, after the launch of the movement to increase production and practice economy, the state-owned commercial system expanded its procurement and sales tasks, increased commodity inventory, and basically guaranteed the supply of people's necessities.

Transportation work has also made great progress, expanding freight volume and strengthening planned transportation and planned management.

Tax revenue targets may also be exceeded, and fiscal expenditures have been reduced in a planned manner.

In the movement to increase production and practice economy, all parties have launched the work of promoting advanced experience and rationalization proposals, which has powerfully promoted the development and continuous deepening of the movement. All of these have created favorable conditions for better completing and overfulfilling the 1953 national plan and have laid a good foundation for next year's plan.

The rapid development and great achievements of the movement to increase production and practice economy demonstrate that China's people's democratic dictatorship is a vibrant system, and the socialist state-owned economy is exceptionally superior. On the basis of this political and economic system, as long as we can correctly explain to the vast number of cadres and the masses the general line of our country during the transition period, the basic tasks of our country's first five-year plan, and the great significance of increasing production and practicing economy, we will be able to bring into play the high initiative and creativity of the people, tap the unlimited potential forces in all aspects, overcome all difficulties, complete and overfulfill the state plan, and improve the level of leadership in all aspects, and promote the continuous progress of our country's construction cause.

The year 1953 is coming to an end, but at present, we should continue to build on the existing achievements and strive for greater achievements in increasing production and practicing economy, in order to overfulfill the 1953 national plan and the plan to increase production and practice economy; and on this basis, we should prepare well and welcome the construction tasks of 1954.

In general, the development of the movement to increase production and practice economy is relatively normal. All regions, departments, and enterprises have generally paid attention to combining increasing production and practicing economy with ensuring the completion of the state plan, improving enterprise management, and improving current work. However, there are still some problems and shortcomings in the movement. In order to achieve greater achievements, and also in order to regularize the increase of production and the practice of economy, it is necessary to overcome shortcomings and solve existing problems.

In terms of industrial production, although enterprise management has improved somewhat, many accidents and low product quality are currently prominent problems. According to incomplete statistics, personal injury and death accidents in factories and mines increased in both October and November compared to September; mechanical accidents are also very serious. Fushun Steel Plant had continuous incidents of steel leakage and transformer burnout in October; mechanical accidents at the Lihua Paper Mill of the Ministry of Light Industry increased significantly in October compared to September; the No. 4 rubber mixing machine of the Rubber No. 9 Factory was damaged due to workers violating operating procedures and the machine being overloaded. Damage to machines also occurs frequently in other units, and power outages in the power industry are also very serious, which greatly hinders production.

In terms of product quality, although there has been general improvement, some products are still not good or very unstable. For example, the production of paper by the Ministry of Light Industry may affect the completion of this year's production increase task due to the poor quality of products from Jinzhou, Lihua, and Taiyuan paper mills; among them, Jinzhou Paper Mill has increased dust in the paper and waste and substandard products have reached a maximum of 80 percent due to neglecting cleaning work. In the heavy industry and machinery industry, some factories and mines have also experienced a decline in quality. For example, Taiyuan Steel Plant often experienced low-temperature steel tapping during rush production, resulting in a large number of defective products; the rejection rate of steel ingot molds at Fushun Heavy Machinery Plant increased from 12 to 13 percent in September to 18 to 19 percent in early October; and 47 motors at Harbin Electrical Machinery Plant needed to be returned for repair in October, affecting the completion of the production plan. Quality decline and increased scrap rates also exist to varying degrees in other areas.

The main reason for the above situation is that the leading cadres of some enterprises do not have a sufficient understanding of the principle that the movement to increase production and practice economy must be combined with improving enterprise management, or they do not control it strictly in their work. Some factories and mines are still blindly rushing to produce while neglecting quality, safety, and normal equipment maintenance and repair; a few cadres also have the mistaken idea that "a little bit of poor quality is better than not completing the task." It is now the end of the year, and the phenomenon of rushing to catch up with work may increase further. Therefore, we must pay close attention to this and strictly control it, resolutely prevent and correct the increase in accidents and the decline in quality, and strive to comprehensively complete and overfulfill the 1953 national plan.

In terms of capital construction, although the speed has increased, the disorganization of management on many construction sites has not been completely overcome, and the phenomenon of waiting for materials to stop work occurs from time to time, so the final stages of work are dragged out for a long time; the waste of materials is still quite serious; and in the production increase and economy campaign, a few construction sites still have the phenomenon of one-sidedly pursuing progress while neglecting quality. To overcome these shortcomings, all regions must seize the time, step up supervision of projects nearing completion, quickly complete the final stages of work, and after completion, do a good job in acceptance, trial operation, financial settlement, and recovery of materials and tools and production preparation; at the same time, they must draw out forces to support other key projects as much as possible. All construction units that have not yet been completed must immediately calculate the tasks, time, and supply of various materials, formulate specific construction operation plans, strengthen dispatching work and various specific measures, and strive to complete the plan while ensuring quality, and reduce the number of projects spanning years. All capital construction units must also, based on the experience of implementing this year's capital construction plan, seriously prepare for next year's construction. At present, we should especially organize design forces to start and continue to focus on the design work of construction projects for 1954 as early as possible; calculate the balance of materials and equipment based on next year's construction tasks; and combine winter training to adjust the existing construction forces and rectify the construction teams.

In terms of commerce, the state-owned commercial system and cooperative commerce have achieved success in organizing sources of goods and expanding planned procurement. However, some regions do not pay enough attention to expanding sales, pay less attention to the arrangement of markets and private retailers, do not accurately grasp the needs of the people, and the accuracy of planning is not enough. There are still some problems in material allocation. In November, under the leadership of Party and government leaders at all levels, state-owned commercial departments in various regions actively expanded supply, overcame the phenomenon of focusing on purchasing and neglecting sales, and completed the sales tasks for the month, but the situation in various regions is still very unbalanced. Some regions lack the necessary analysis of inventory and sources of goods, pay insufficient attention to accelerating capital turnover and reducing circulation costs, still borrow more from banks, and have many links and long turnover times for commodity turnover. Due to inaccurate planning and inflexible commodity allocation, the phenomenon of stockpiling in one place and selling out in another still occurs from time to time for certain commodities. The supply of certain commodities, especially agricultural production tools, must be strengthened.

In order to solve the above problems, the Party and government leading organs in various regions should further strengthen leadership and inspection of the commercial system, promote commercial departments to be thrifty, deeply understand the needs of the market, especially the rural market, analyze inventory commodities, plan the market in a planned manner, accurately allocate materials, expand commodity purchase and sales, especially in coordination with grain procurement, and arrange the rural market well. For general commodities, while maintaining appropriate inventory, we should actively sell them and continue to overcome the phenomenon of purchasing and hoarding, so as to accelerate capital turnover and reduce bank credit. At the same time, for commodities with large inventories, we should still formulate different methods with control for appropriate wholesale to private retailers according to the development of cooperatives and state-owned retail networks in various regions. In expanding purchase and sales, we should pay attention to doing a good job in commodity allocation and adjustment.

In terms of financial work, since the launch of the movement to increase production and practice economy, the financial reserves of our country have become more abundant due to increased revenue and reduced expenditure. However, compared with the financial reserves necessary for large-scale construction, our financial reserves must be greatly enhanced. Therefore, continuing to actively save expenditure and increase revenue should become a long-term and arduous task for us in the future. A few regions believe that achievements have been made in increasing production and practicing economy, and therefore financial work can be relaxed, and the idea and practice of continuing to expand revenue and save expenditure can be relaxed. This is incorrect. At present, all regions must continue to focus on tax collection and the remittance and deposit of enterprise profits; all expenditures should still be strictly controlled and should not be relaxed in the slightest. For all expenditures that can be postponed to next year, all departments and regions should make proper arrangements in advance, and clearly calculate the expenses that need to be transferred to next year and submit them to the financial committee at the same level for review, so as to consider including them in next year's budget. In addition to organizing and inspecting normal revenue and expenditure, financial organs at all levels should also organize all capital construction units to earnestly do a good job in the year-end inventory of capital equipment, so as to prepare conditions for correctly calculating and allocating next year's expenditure. Due to the increase in this year's procurement tasks, the bank's funds need to be greatly increased. All enterprises and commercial departments should reduce loans from banks, strive to handle stagnant material, accelerate capital turnover, and increase bank deposits under the conditions of ensuring normal production, circulation, and normal inventory. All enterprise profits and fiscal revenues that can be submitted and deposited in advance should be strived to be submitted and deposited in advance.

In addition to paying attention to solving the above problems, all regions, departments, and units should earnestly summarize the experience of this year's movement to increase production and practice economy, so as to regularize the movement to increase production and practice economy, and to implement the increase of production and practice of economy into the future various regular work. Increasing production, increasing income, practicing strict economy, and tightening expenditure are not only what we have to do this year, but also an important policy that our country must implement for a long time. The people of the whole country must continue to make persistent efforts and strive for greater achievements in increasing production and practicing economy this year.

    再接再厉，争取增产节约的更大成就
    今年九月在全国展开的增产节约运动，在各级党政机关和领导干部及全体职工的努力下，已获得显著的成绩。
    工业生产方面，中央重工业部、燃料工业部、第一机械工业部、轻工业部、纺织工业部五个部门九月、十月、十一月份的总产值计划都超额完成了。在二十四种主要产品中，九月份有十九种超额完成了计划，十月份有十五种超额完成了计划，十一月份有二十种完成和超额完成了计划。现在有些厂矿已提前完成了一九五三年的计划，预计到年底，极大多数产品都可完成或超额完成国家计划。某些产品的质量已有所提高，成本降低，企业管理的水平已有一定程度的提高。在增加生产的基础上，中央各部上缴企业利润的计划，到年底不仅能保证完成，而且还可超过。各大区和省市经营的地方国营工业企业在生产上也有改进，利润也有所增加。
    基本建设方面，多数工地已展开劳动竞赛，九月份以来工程进度已显著加快，质量也有改进。据国家统计局统计，中央五个工业部九月份平均完成全年投资计划的百分之十四点四，十月份完成百分之十三点六，十一月份进度也较快，不少重要工程单位并提出在保证工程质量的前提下提前完工。对我国工业建设有重大意义的鞍山钢铁公司的无缝钢管厂和大型轧钢厂已经竣工，七号高炉也可如期完工。如果各地再加一把劲，今年的基本建设计划可能比原来的预计完成得更多而且有些还会更好些。
    在商品流转方面，开展增产节约运动以后，国营商业系统扩大了采购和销售任务，增加了商品库存，基本上保证了人民必需品的供应。
    交通运输工作也有很大进步，扩大了货运量，加强了计划运输和计划管理。
    税收任务也可能超过，财政开支已有计划地削减。
    各方面在增产节约运动中，都展开了推广先进经验及合理化建议的工作，有力地推动了运动的发展和不断地深入。所有这些，都为更好地完成和超额完成一九五三年的国家计划创造了有利的条件，并为明年的计划打下了良好的基础。
    增产节约运动的迅速开展和巨大的成就，说明了我国人民民主专政的国家制度是富有生命力的制度，社会主义性质的国营经济是异常优越的。在这种政治和经济制度的基础上，只要我们能够正确地向广大干部和人民群众讲明我们国家过渡时期的总路线，讲明我们国家第一个五年计划的基本任务，讲明增产节约的伟大意义，我们就能够发挥人民群众高度的积极性和创造性，把各方面的无限的潜在力量发掘出来，战胜一切困难，完成和超额完成国家的计划，并提高各方面领导工作的水平，推动我们国家的建设事业不断前进。
    一九五三年即将过去，但是目前还应在已有成绩的基础上，再接再厉，争取增产节约有更大的成就，以便超额地完成一九五三年的国家计划和增产节约计划；并在这个基础上很好地准备和迎接一九五四年的建设任务。
    总的来说，目前增产节约运动的发展是比较正常的。各地区、各部门、各企业单位一般都注意了增产节约和保证完成国家计划、改善企业经营管理和改善当前工作相结合。但在运动中，还存在着一些问题和缺点。为了取得更大的成就，同时也为了使增产节约经常化，必须克服缺点，解决存在的问题。
    在工业生产方面，企业管理虽然有所改进，但事故多、产品质量低乃是目前存在的比较突出的问题。据不完全的统计，厂矿中人身伤亡事故十月、十一月份都比九月份增加；机械事故也很严重。抚顺制钢厂十月份连续发生漏钢、变压器烧毁事故；轻工业部利华造纸厂机械事故十月份比九月份显著增加；橡胶九厂四号炼胶机，因工人违反操作规程，机器吃力过甚而损坏了。其他单位损坏机器的事情也经常发生，电业部门的停断电事故也很严重，对生产妨碍很大。
    在产品质量方面，一般虽有改进，但一部分产品仍然不好，或者很不稳定。如轻工业部纸的生产，由于锦州、利华、太原三个纸厂的产品的质量不好，有可能影响今年增产任务的完成；其中锦州纸厂由于忽视清洁工作，纸的尘埃增多，废品和次品最高曾达百分之八十。重工业和机械工业方面，某些厂矿也发生质量下降现象。如太原钢厂突击生产，经常发生低温出钢，造成大量废品；抚顺重机厂钢锭模九月份废品率为百分之十二至十三，十月上旬增为百分之十八至十九；哈尔滨机电厂十月份有四十七部电机需要返修，影响生产计划的完成。其他方面质量下降、废品增多的现象也或多或少存在。
    产生上述情况的主要原因，是由于某些企业的领导干部对增产节约运动必须与改善企业管理工作相结合的原则认识不足或在工作中控制不严，一部分厂矿仍然是片面突击生产，而忽视质量、安全以及正常的设备维护和检修工作；少数干部还存在着“质量差点比完不成任务强”的错误思想。目前已近年终，突击赶工的现象可能更为增加，对此必须十分注意并予以严格控制，切实防止和纠正事故增加和质量下降的现象，争取全面完成和超额完成一九五三年的国家计划。
    在基本建设方面，目前速度虽有提高，但不少工地组织管理上的紊乱现象尚未彻底克服，待料停工的现象不时发生，因此尾工拖得很迟；材料浪费现象还相当严重；在增产节约竞赛中少数工地还存在着片面追求进度而忽视质量的现象。要克服这些缺点，各地必须抓紧时间，对即将完工的工程，加紧督促，迅速完成尾工，并在完工后做好验收、试车、财务结算以及材料、工具的回收和生产准备工作；同时要抽出力量，尽量支援其他重点工程。所有尚未完工的施工单位，必须立即计算任务、时间及各种材料的供应，订出具体的施工作业计划，加强调度工作和各项具体措施，在保证质量的前提下，争取计划的完成，减少跨年度工程数量。各基本建设单位还必须根据执行今年基本建设计划的经验，认真进行明年建设的准备工作。目前应特别组织设计力量，及早开始和继续抓紧一九五四年度施工工程的设计工作；根据明年建设任务，计算材料、设备的平衡；结合冬训，调整现有的施工力量，整顿施工队伍。
    商业方面，国营商业系统和合作社商业在组织货源、扩大计划采购方面，是有成绩的。但若干地区对扩大推销还不够重视，对市场和私营零售商的安排注意较少，对人民的需要还掌握的不准，计划的准确性不够，在物资调拨上还存在一些问题。十一月份各地国营商业部门在各级党政领导下，积极扩大供应的结果，克服了重购轻销的现象，完成了当月的销售任务，但各地的情况还是很不平衡的。部分地区对库存和货源缺乏必要的分析，对加速资金周转、降低流转费用还注意不够，向银行贷款还较多，商品周转的环节也多，周转时间较长。由于计划不够准确，商品调拨不灵，某些商品还时常发生此地积压彼地脱销的现象。某些商品特别是农村生产用具的供应工作还必须加强。
    为了解决上述问题，各地党、政领导机关应进一步加强对商业系统的领导和检查，推动商业部门精打细算，深入地了解市场特别是农村市场的需要，分析库存商品，有计划地安排市场，准确地调配物资，扩大商品购销，特别是配合粮食收购，安排好农村市场。对一般商品在保持适当库存的条件下，应积极销售，继续克服购囤惜售的现象，以加速资金周转，减少银行信贷。同时对库存较多的商品，仍应根据各地合作社和国营零售网发展的情况，分别规定不同办法，有控制地对私营零售商作适当批发。在扩大购销工作中，则应注意做好商品的调拨和调剂工作。
    在财政工作方面，增产节约运动开展以后，由于增加了收入，节约了开支，使我们国家的财政后备更为充实。但和大规模建设所必需的财政后备相比较，我们的财政后备还必须大大增强。因此，继续积极地节约开支、增加收入，应当成为我们今后长期的艰巨的任务。少数地区认为增产节约已经取得了成绩，因而可以放松财政工作，可以放松继续扩大收入、节约开支的想法和作法，这是不正确的。目前各地必须继续抓紧税收和企业利润的上缴和入库工作；对于各项支出仍应严格控制，不应丝毫放松。凡可以推迟到明年的开支，各部门、各地区应预先作妥善安排，并将需要跨转到明年的经费核算清楚，报送同级财委审查，以便考虑列入明年预算。各级财政机关除对正常的收支认真组织检查以外，还要组织各基本建设单位认真作好资材设备的年终清点盘存工作，为正确地计算和分配明年的支出准备条件。由于今年收购任务加大，银行资金需要大量增加，各企业单位及商业部门应在保证正常生产、流转和正常库存的条件下，减少向银行的贷款，努力处理呆滞材料，加速资金周转，并增加银行存款。所有能够争取提前上缴的企业利润和财政收入，应力争提前上缴入库。
    各地区、各部门、各单位除了注意解决上述问题以外，应认真地总结今年增产节约运动的经验，以便使增产节约运动经常化，使增产节约贯彻到今后的各项经常工作中去。增加生产、增加收入、厉行节约、紧缩开支，这不仅是我们今年所要做的，而且是我们国家长期必须执行的一项重要的政策。全国人民必须再接再厉，争取今年的增产节约有更大的成就。
