In recent years, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, China's water conservancy construction work has made great progress. In addition to carrying out varying degrees of treatment work on the major rivers that caused greater harm, many farmland water conservancy projects have also been built. It has played a great role in developing agricultural production and improving and raising the living standards of farmers.

In terms of the treatment of various rivers: The lower reaches of the Yellow River were liberated earlier, and treatment began in 1947. Henan and Shandong provinces have now added nearly 100 million cubic meters of earthwork to the 1,700-kilometer-long dikes, and the top of the dikes has been universally raised by 1.5 to 3 meters above the 1933 water level (the 1933 Yellow River Shanzhou water level was 299.14 meters, exceeding the normal flood season water level by 7 meters). In the past four years, pebble dams have been continuously replaced with stone dams, and bank protection projects have been continuously added. In terms of dike protection, the method of cone probing dikes has been promoted, with a total of more than 45 million drillings, eliminating more than 70,000 large and small hidden dangers. In order to defend against abnormal floods, the Shitou Zhuang flood diversion project and the Lijin ice reduction and water diversion project have also been built. Due to the above projects, it is possible to defend against floods similar to those in 1933. In order to protect the land on both sides of the Yellow River, the Houtao area of ​​Suiyuan also built more than 300 kilometers of dikes. Relevant departments are also constantly conducting investigations and studies on the fundamental treatment of the Yellow River and the soil and water conservation work on the Loess Plateau in the upper reaches. The basic contents of the Huai River treatment project are flood control and drainage. In terms of flood control, a total of three mountain valley reservoirs, 15 depression storage projects, more than 2,000 kilometers of dikes on major tributaries, and more than 130 large culverts, gates and other buildings have been completed. Three reservoirs are still under construction. The construction of these projects ensures that the main dikes of the Huai River and its tributaries are safe in the event of floods in 1950. In terms of improving waterlogging, the main work was the diversion project of internal and external water in the middle reaches, the excavation of the Xiacaowan and Bogang diversion rivers, the treatment of the Xifei River, Sui River, Tuo River, and Beifei River, the tributaries with the most serious waterlogging, and the mobilization of the masses to carry out general ditch projects. A total of 77 rivers of various sizes have been renovated, with a total dredging length of more than 2,800 kilometers. Waterlogging disasters have been gradually reduced. In addition, the 170-kilometer-long Subei Irrigation Main Canal has been built in the lower reaches in combination with the needs of flood discharge, which will be able to irrigate 1.7 million hectares of farmland in the future. In terms of the treatment of the Yangtze River, the main projects carried out were the Jingjiang flood diversion, the reinforcement of the Jingjiang Dike, the Datong Lake storage and reclamation, the renovation of the South Dongting Lake, and the vigorous reinforcement of the dikes in the middle and lower reaches and the main dikes of the Han River. Drainage projects have also been done to some extent. Among them, the flood storage area of ​​the Jingjiang flood diversion project covers an area of ​​more than 900 square kilometers, and can store part of the flood when the water is too large in summer and autumn, ensuring the safety of the people on both sides of the Jingjiang River.

Various places have also carried out treatment of smaller rivers. The Northeast region has initially built dikes on the Taoer River, Raoyang River and other rivers. In addition to general repairs to the rivers in North China, a new waterway capable of discharging 3,000 cubic meters per second was opened in the lower reaches of the Chaobai River in 1950. This year, a 40-kilometer-long independent sea-entry reduction river was opened in the lower reaches of the Daqing River, and the Guanting Reservoir, which can store 2.27 billion cubic meters of water, was built in the upper reaches of the Yongding River. These projects have played a certain role in reducing flood disasters in various basins. In order to prevent wind and tide, the East China region has universally repaired seawalls and sea dikes along the coast. Shandong and Jiangsu provinces also separately managed the Yi River and Shu River, excavating more than 250 kilometers of new river channels, doing 120 million cubic meters of earth and stone, and 72 gates, dams, and culverts, eliminating the threat of floods to more than 10 million mu of land in the basin that was constantly affected by disasters. The rivers in the Central and Southern regions, including the Pearl River, have also undergone the renovation of main dikes and enclosure dikes.

In terms of building farmland water conservancy projects: The Northeast region has completed 52 projects such as Panshan and Dongliao River, restoring 1.2 million mu of rice fields. Farmers of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia have never had the habit of diverting water for irrigation. In 1951, the government invested in the construction of six irrigation projects, irrigating more than 230,000 mu of farmland. In recent years, North China has restored and built many large-scale irrigation projects with 50,000 mu to 300,000 mu of irrigated land. More than 20 projects, including the Xiahe River, Hutuo River and Sanggan River silt irrigation projects in Shanxi Province, the Shijin Canal irrigation project in the cotton and wheat producing areas of western Hebei Province, and the large-scale electric water lifting irrigation projects along the northern section of the Bohai Sea, have benefited one after another. Hou Tao, Suiyuan, has ten irrigation canal systems diverting water from the Yellow River and dozens of small canals. The completion of the Huangyang Gate project has added new-style water intake equipment to the three large canals in the west. In the Central Plains region, the Yellow River irrigation Jiwei project was built, which is the first attempt to divert Yellow River water for irrigation in the lower reaches of the Yellow River. The Northwest is the most arid and rainless area in China, and farmers deeply realize that there is no agriculture without irrigation. In recent years, the government has invested a large number of loans to build and renovate many canal projects. Such as the Leng Hui Canal, Yun Hui Canal, etc. in Shaanxi Province, the Huangyang Canal, Yuanyang Pond, Xinmin Canal in Gansu, the Tanglai Canal, Huinong Canal in Ningxia Province, the Dongyuan Canal in Qinghai, and the Hongyan Pond in the grain-deficient area of ​​Xinjiang, etc., have been successively repaired and completed. The Luo Hui Canal in Shaanxi Province was a project that was not completed and put into water for sixteen years during the reactionary ruling era. It was continued and completed in 1950, and now it has irrigated 400,000 mu of farmland. East China and Central South have also built dozens of places such as the Xiu Hui Canal, Baishan Canal, Erling Electric Irrigation Canal, and Chang Canal. In addition to renovating the original irrigation system of Dujiangyan in the Southwest region, it has been able to obtain sufficient water, and has also built the Guan Canal Weir project by diverting water from Dujiangyan, increasing the irrigation of 230,000 mu of farmland.

While large-scale irrigation projects are being built, the Party and the government have paid special attention to the development of various small-scale farmland water conservancy projects that are suitable for local conditions. The waterwheel is one of the most popular agricultural tools for farmers in the northern region to get rid of the threat of drought and increase crop yields. In 1950, the government redesigned the old and heavy iron waterwheels in rural areas and transformed them into lightweight "Liberation-style waterwheels." Last year, under the guidance of Soviet water conservancy expert Comrade Bukov, a "sprocket-type" deep-well waterwheel was designed, which solved the problem of water extraction from deep wells of about 15 meters, and was warmly welcomed by farmers. At present, the area where waterwheels are used to draw water for irrigation is no longer limited to North China, Shandong, Henan and other places. Farmers in Gansu, Western Liaoning, Rehe, Heilongjiang, and Yunnan, Guangdong and other provinces have also begun to use them under the advocacy and assistance of the government. Digging wells is also an effective measure for farmers to fight drought. There has been a large number of developments every year in the drought prevention and drought resistance movement. In the central part of Hebei and the northern part of Henan, many villages have been completely transformed into water land due to the use of groundwater for irrigation, and in some counties, 90% of the cultivated land has become water land. In the provinces south of the Yangtze River, the main reliance is on ponds and dams for irrigation. After varying degrees of renovation with the strong assistance of the government, most of the millions of ponds, dikes and dams in these areas can ensure that there will be no disasters if it does not rain for 20 to 40 days. Since last year, the government has also paid attention to leading the construction of small reservoirs in the hilly and mountainous areas of Hunan and Guangdong, which has produced good results in terms of large-scale water storage and prevention of mountain floods. Mechanical drainage and irrigation in lake low-lying areas and small water pump irrigation along rivers and ditches have also developed in Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, and Hubei. Every year when farmland needs water and during drought seasons, pumping stations vigorously dispatch water pumps to serve farmers. Other water lifting tools such as windmills, tub wheels, overhead wheels, and dragon bone waterwheels have also been greatly developed and improved every year.

In addition, the management systems of the original engineering equipment in various places have also been reformed. Most of the irrigation areas have established democratic and unified management organizations; and have begun to guide farmers to implement more reasonable and advanced water use systems, and lead farmers to pay attention to strengthening the maintenance of existing projects, so that the projects have played a greater role.

To sum up, in the past four years, a total of more than 250 large-scale projects and more than 4 million small-scale projects have been built across the country, more than 800,000 wells have been drilled, more than 500,000 waterwheels have been loaned, and more than 30,000 horsepower of water pumps have been developed. These projects have expanded the irrigated area by more than 54 million mu.

The implementation of the above projects has played a significant role in preventing floods and droughts, increasing grain production, and improving farmers' lives. In the northern well areas, irrigated land generally yields 60 to 90 jin more grain per mu than dry land, and some increase by a factor of two. Turning dry land into paddy fields in the south increases the yield by several times, and some rice fields in areas that change from one crop to two crops, and from two crops to three crops, also increase production by 30% to more than 100%. The construction of large-scale irrigation projects has enabled farmers in many areas to end the disastrous lives brought about by old China. For example, the Yellow River irrigation Jiwei project in the middle reaches of the Yellow River has turned hundreds of thousands of mu of sandy and thin land into fertile land, and hundreds of thousands of farmers no longer have to flee famine. The Dujiangyan irrigation area in Sichuan has increased production year after year for four years, and this year's output has increased by 20% compared with before liberation. Farmers' lives have risen rapidly. According to a survey, 60% of poor farmers in Zhongba Village, Wenjiang County, have risen to become middle peasants. In the past, Yongguzhou, Jiangsu, was annually flooded and suffered from poor harvests. Farmers often cut rice in small boats, and had to go out to make a living for several months of the year. After liberation, dikes were repaired and an electric drainage station was built, which generally increased the production of paddy fields and expanded tens of thousands of mu of wheat fields, and farmers' lives were generally improved. As for the treatment of the Yangtze River, Huai River and other major rivers, it has changed the face of vast rural areas. For example, after the completion of the Jingjiang flood diversion project, the rural areas on both sides of the Jingjiang River have shown unprecedented prosperity. The Huai River treatment project has played a role in controlling floods. For example, in the past, when the water of Hongze Lake rose in the Subei area, it would cause a large area of ​​flooding. Now Hongze Lake has been built into a reservoir, and rice fields are supplied with water in time through the irrigation main canal. This year, 2 million mu of farmland has increased production by 20%.

The People's Government has made its best efforts in water conservancy construction to develop agricultural production and improve the living standards of the people. According to incomplete statistics from the founding of New China to October 1953 alone, in the treatment of various rivers, a total of more than 2.688 billion cubic meters of earthwork, more than 17 million cubic meters of stone, and more than 630,000 cubic meters of concrete were used. In terms of farmland water conservancy, nearly 3.3 trillion yuan of loans were issued to solve the financial difficulties of farmers in building water conservancy, and more than 1 trillion yuan was invested in the construction of large-scale irrigation projects. In addition, the method of substituting work for relief was also used to help farmers solve some farmland water conservancy problems, such as the more than 60,000 projects built in Hubei last winter and this spring, which relieved the threat of drought to nearly 3 million mu of rice fields.

The consolidated worker-peasant alliance and the enthusiasm of the masses are one of the powerful factors for the remarkable achievements of water conservancy construction projects. When the Runheji diversion gate was first built in 1951, railway workers actively taught farmers how to drive railway spikes in order to lay light railways, and quickly trained enough manpower. Shanghai workers manufactured huge steel gates for Runheji and sent outstanding workers to install them in person. They did not stop work in rainy days or hot days of 100 degrees Fahrenheit, striving to complete the work as soon as possible in order to control floods. In order to meet the needs of building gates, dams, and reservoirs in various places, workers in various places also manufactured many concrete mixers, bulldozers, sheep foot rollers, air compressors, air drills, explosives, steel bars, cement, dump trucks, flat cars and other machinery and equipment. In order to complete the project as soon as possible and relieve the threat of floods to farmers as soon as possible, the workers on each construction site fully demonstrated their enthusiasm and creativity. In the Jingjiang flood diversion project, the iron team created a new record of completing the steel bars for a gate hole in 7 hours and 30 minutes. The pouring of concrete was increased from 2,000 cubic meters per day to more than 3,000 cubic meters, and the workers who drove rivets increased from 220 per day to 880. The reason why the workers worked so selflessly was because they knew that "they were supporting millions of farmers and building the motherland."

    水利建设对农民生产的巨大帮助
    王雷　廖学茂
    几年来，在共产党和毛主席的领导下，我国水利建设工作有很大进展。除对为害较大的主要江河都进行了程度不等的治理工作外，更兴修了不少的农田水利工程。对于发展农业生产，改善和提高农民生活起了很大的作用。
    在各江河的治理方面：黄河下游因解放较早，于一九四七年即开始治理，河南、山东两省现已在
  一千七百多公里的堤防上增培土方近一亿公方，堤顶普遍加高，超出一九三三年水位一公尺半到三公尺（一九三三年黄河陕州水位二九九点一四公尺，超过常年汛期水位七公尺）。近四年来，又不断将埽坝改为石坝，并不断加修护岸工程。在堤防的防护方面，推行了锥探大堤的办法，共打钻四千五百多万眼，消灭大小隐患七万多处。为了防御异常洪水，又修建了石头庄溢洪工程、利津减凌分水工程。由于进行了以上工程，可以争取防御与一九三三年类似的洪水。绥远后套为了保护黄河两岸的土地，也修了三百多公里的堤防。黄河的治本工作以及上游黄土高原的水土保持工作，有关部门也不断进行考查研究。淮河治理工程的基本内容是防洪与排涝两方面。在防洪方面共已完成山谷水库三座、洼地蓄洪工程十五处、培修干支流堤防二千余公里以及大型涵、闸等建筑物一百三十余座，正在修建的水库还有三座，这些工程的兴建，使淮河干支流主要堤防在一九五○年洪水情况下能保证安全。在改善内涝方面主要进行了中游内外水分流工程，挖掘了下草湾、泊岗两条引河，整治了内涝最严重的西淝河、濉河、沱河、北淝河等支流，并发动群众普遍做了沟洫工程。计共整治大小河道七十七条，其中疏浚总长度达二千八百多公里。内涝灾害已逐步减轻。此外，还在下游结合排洪需要修筑了长一百七十公里的苏北灌溉总渠，将来可灌田一百七十万公顷。治理长江方面主要进行了荆江分洪、荆江大堤加固、大通湖蓄洪垦殖、南洞庭湖整修等工程，并大力培修了中、下游堤防和汉江干堤。排水工程也做了一部分。其中荆江分洪工程蓄洪区面积九百多平方公里，夏秋水过大时可分蓄一部分洪水，保障荆江两岸人民的安全。
    各地对较小河流也都进行了治理。东北区初步修筑了洮儿河、绕阳河等河的堤防。华北各河除进行了一般整修外，一九五○年在潮白河下游开辟了能排泄三千秒立方公尺流量的新水道，今年在大清河下游开辟了四十余公里长的独流入海减河，在永定河上游修建了能蓄水二十二亿七千万立方公尺的官厅水库。这些工程对减除各流域洪水灾害都起了一定的作用。华东区为了防风防潮，沿海普遍整修了海塘、海堤。山东、江苏两省还分别治理了沂河沭河，共开挖新河道二百五十多公里，做土、石方
  一亿二千多万立方公尺，闸、坝、涵洞等七十二座，使流域内常年受灾的一千多万亩土地免除了洪水威胁。中南境内各河包括珠江在内也都进行干堤及围堤的整修工程。
    在兴修农田水利工程方面：东北区完成了盘山、东辽河等五十二处工程，恢复稻田一百二十万亩。内蒙地区各族农民从来没有引水浇地习惯，一九五一年政府投资兴办了六处灌溉工程，灌溉了二十三万余亩农田。华北区几年来恢复与新建了很多灌田五万亩至三十万亩的大型灌溉工程，现已陆续受益的有山西省潇河、滹沱河及桑干河淤灌工程，河北省西部棉麦产区的石津渠灌溉工程及渤海北段沿岸较大规模的电力提水灌溉工程等二十余处。绥远后套有从黄河引水的十大灌溉渠系及数十条小渠，黄杨闸工程的完成，已为西部三条大渠道增添了新式进水设备。在中原地区兴修了引黄灌溉济卫工程，这是在黄河下游引黄水灌溉的创举。西北是我国最干旱少雨的地带，农民们深刻认识到无灌溉就无农业的道理。政府几年来曾大批投放贷款兴修整修了许多渠道工程。如陕西省的冷惠渠、云惠渠等，甘肃的黄羊渠、鸳鸯池、新民渠，宁夏省的唐徕渠、惠农渠，青海东原渠，及新疆缺粮地区的红雁池等，均先后修整完工放水。陕西省的洛惠渠是过去反动统治时代十六年未曾完成放水的工程，已于一九五零年续修完成，现在并已灌溉了四十万亩农田。华东、中南也修建了绣惠渠、柏山渠、珥陵电力灌溉渠、长渠等数十处。西南区除整修了都江堰原有灌溉系统，已能得到充足用水外，并引都江堰水新建了官渠堰工程，增灌农田二十三万亩。
    在大型灌溉工程兴建的同时，党和政府特别注意了各种各样的因地制宜的小型农田水利的发展。水车是北方地区农民为了解除干旱威胁，增加作物产量的最喜爱的农具之一。一九五○年政府将农村中旧有的笨重的铁制水车从新设计改制成轻便的 “解放式水车”，去年又在苏联水利专家布可夫同志指导之下，设计了“链轮式”深井水车，解决了十五公尺左右深井的汲水问题，受到农民的热烈欢迎。目前用水车汲水灌田的地区，已不限于华北、山东、河南等地，像甘肃、辽西、热河、黑龙江、以及云南、广东等省的农民，也在政府的倡导扶助下，开始使用起来。开凿水井也是农民赖以抗旱的有效措施，在防旱抗旱运动中每年都有大量的发展。在河北中部及河南北部地区由于利用地下水灌溉，很多村庄已全部变为水地，个别县份并有百分之九十耕地成为水地。江南各省，主要是依靠塘坝灌溉的地区。这些地区数百万处的塘堰堤坝，在政府大力协助下，经过了不同程度的整修后，大部能保证二十天至四十天不下雨不成灾的要求。从去年开始，政府又注意领导了湖南、广东丘陵山狱地带的小型水库的兴建，对于大量的蓄水和防止山洪，都产生了良好效果。滨湖低洼地区的机械排灌以及沿河圳的小型抽水机灌溉，在广东、江苏、浙江、湖南、湖北等地也有了发展。每年在农田需水时和干旱季节抗旱时，抽水机站就大力出动抽水机为农民服务。其他的提水工具如风车、筒车、天车、龙骨水车等每年都有大量的发展与改进。
    此外，对各地原有的工程设备的管理制度也进行了改革，绝大多数的灌区都建立了民主的、统一的管理组织；并已开始指导农民进行较合理的和先进的用水制度，领导农民注意加强既成工程的养护，因而使工程发挥了更大作用。
    综合上述，四年来，全国各地共兴修了大型工程二百五十余处，小型工程四百余万处，凿井八十余万眼，贷放水车五十余万辆，抽水机发展了三万余匹马力。这些工程共扩大了灌溉面积五千四百余万亩。
    以上各项工程的兴修，对于防止水旱灾害，增加粮食生产，改善农民生活，已起了很显著的作用。北方水井地区，水浇地比旱地一般每亩要多收粮六十斤到九十斤，有的增加一倍。南方的旱地变稻田，产量增加数倍，有些一造改二造，二造改三造的稻田地区，也增产三成到一倍以上。大型灌溉工程的兴建使很多地区农民结束了从旧中国带来的灾难生活。如黄河中游的引黄灌溉济卫工程等，已使数十万亩砂薄地变成沃土，几十万农民不再出外逃荒。四川都江堰灌区四年来年年增产，今年产量已比解放前提高二成，农民生活迅速上升，据调查温江县中坝村已有百分之六十的贫农上升为中农。江苏永固洲过去是年年内涝、岁岁歉收，农民经常撑着小船割稻，一年中有几个月要出外谋生。解放后修好了堤圩，建立了电力排水站，使得稻田普遍增产，还扩大了上万亩的麦田，农民生活普遍提高。至于长江、淮河等大江河的治理，更使广大农村改变了面貌。如荆江分洪工程完成后荆江两岸农村已呈现空前繁荣景象。治淮工程已起了控制洪水的作用。如苏北地区过去洪泽湖水一涨便造成大片汪洋，现在洪泽湖已修成蓄水库，并通过灌溉总渠及时供应稻田用水，今年已有二百万亩农田增产二成。
    人民政府为了发展农业生产，提高人民生活水平，在水利建设工作方面尽了最大努力。仅就新中国成立后截至一九五三年十月的不完全统计，在各江河的治理方面，共做土方二十六亿八千多万立方公尺，石方一千七百多万公方，混凝土六十三万余公方。在农田水利方面，发放贷款近三万三千亿元，解决农民兴修水利时的经费困难，投资一万亿元以上兴建大型灌溉工程。此外，还用以工代赈的方法帮助农民解决一部分农田水利问题，如去冬今春在湖北修的六万多处工程，解脱了近三百万亩水稻的旱灾威胁。
    巩固的工农联盟和群众的积极性是水利建设工程获得显著成绩的有力因素之一。一九五一年润河集分水闸初建时，为了铺设轻便铁道，铁路工人积极教农民打道钉，很快地培养了足够的人手。上海工人为润河集制造了巨大的钢质闸门，并派优秀工人亲自前往安装，他们在雨天或华氏一百度的热天都没有停工，争取早日完工，以便控制洪水。为了满足各地修建闸、坝、水库的需要，各地工人还制造了很多的混凝土拌和机、推土机、羊脚碾、空气压缩机、风钻、炸药、钢筋、水泥、斗车、平车等机器器材。为了使工程尽快地完成，使农民兄弟早日免除水灾的威胁，各工地的工人充分发挥了积极性和创造性。在荆江分洪工程中，铁工队创造了七小时三十分钟扎完一孔闸门钢筋的新纪录。浇灌混凝土由每天二千方提高到三千多方，打铆钉工人从每天打二百二十个提高到八百八十个。工人们所以要这样忘我地劳动，因为他们知道“是在支援千百万农民兄弟，是在建设祖国。”
