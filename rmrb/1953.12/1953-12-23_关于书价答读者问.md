    Answering Readers' Questions About Book Prices
    We have received many letters from readers stating that current book prices are too high and hoping that relevant departments will consider lowering them.
    According to our investigation, current book prices are still lower than those before the War of Resistance Against Japan. Current book costs are higher than before the war. Before the war, the direct cost of general books (including paper, printing, and royalties) was less than 30% of the price. Currently, the direct cost of general books published by state-owned publishing houses accounts for about 40% to 50% of the price. Adding distribution costs of 30%, editing and processing fees, publishing fees, advertising fees, national taxes, etc., of about 10%, the profit of state-owned publishing houses is now lower than that of general publishing houses before the war.
    One of the main reasons for the increase in the direct cost of books compared to before the war is that the price of paper is much higher than before the war. Therefore, before the war, paper only accounted for about 6% of the book's price, while it now accounts for 20% to 35% of the book's price. However, the price is lower. For example, before the war, the "Home" published by Kaiming Bookstore was priced at 1.7 yuan, equivalent to about 27 catties of Zhongbai Japonica rice at the time. Now, the "Home" published by People's Literature Publishing House is priced at 12,000 yuan, which is only equivalent to 9 catties of Shanghai Zhongbai Japonica rice. If converted to Xiaozhan rice in Beijing, it is only equivalent to 5 catties.
    In fact, the prices of books published by state-owned publishing houses have been initially reduced. Taking the book prices at the end of 1951 as 100, by the end of 1952, the People's Publishing House and the People's Education Publishing House had an average reduction of 11.84%, the People's Fine Arts Publishing House reduced by 20%, the People's Literature Publishing House reduced by 11%, the Youth Publishing House reduced by 21.24%, and the Workers' Publishing House reduced by 15%. Other state-owned publishing houses reduced by 5% to 12%. Since 1953, the prices of some state-owned publishing houses' books have continued to decline.
    State-owned publishing houses publish books based on the principle of meeting the cultural needs of the people. Although book costs are higher than before the war, they can gradually reduce prices based on continuously improving enterprise management, increasing labor productivity, and reducing costs.
    Some books, such as science and technology books and some books published by private publishing houses, are priced relatively high. Science and technology books require a lot of labor for typesetting and proofreading, editing and processing are also more cumbersome, and the number of copies printed is small (mostly several thousand copies), so the cost is higher, and the pricing is higher than that of general books, which is understandable, but some exceed the appropriate pricing. The high prices of books from some private publishing houses are mainly because they print fewer copies and intentionally seek high profits.
    Based on the above situation, it is obviously not appropriate to implement a general reduction in book prices at present, but only to carry out gradual local adjustments. Because if book prices are generally reduced, it means that the state has to take out a sum of money to subsidize certain state-owned and joint state-private publishing houses. Although this can benefit readers who buy books, the burden on the state and the people will increase accordingly. Therefore, only on the basis of the growing state-owned publishing industry and the continuous improvement of enterprise management and cost reduction can the prices of some books be gradually and appropriately reduced. State-owned publishing houses should actively improve enterprise management, increase labor productivity, produce more good books, create conditions for gradually reducing book prices, and appropriately reduce the prices of some books that are priced too high and have the conditions for reduction. As for the phenomenon of excessively high book prices in private publishing houses, we also hope that publishing administrative organs will pay attention to supervision.

### 关于书价答读者问

专栏：读者来信摘要

    关于书价答读者问
    本报接到许多读者来信，认为目前书籍定价过高，希望有关部门考虑降低。
    根据我们调查，目前书籍的售价与抗日战争前比较还是低廉的。目前书籍成本比战前增高，战前一般书籍的直接成本（包括纸张、印制、稿酬）低于定价的百分之三十，目前国营出版社一般书籍的直接成本约占定价的百分之四十多到五十。再加上发行费用百分之三十，编辑加工费、出版费、宣传费、国税等约百分之十左右，现在国营出版社的利润已比战前一般出版社的利润减低了。
    现在书籍直接成本比战前增高的主要原因之一是纸张的价格比战前高得多。因此，战前纸张一项只占书籍定价的百分之六左右，目前则占书籍定价的百分之二十至三十五。但定价却是降低了。例如，战前开明书店出版的巴金的“家”定价为一元七角，约合当时中白粳米二十七斤，现在人民文学出版社出版的“家”，定价为一万二千元，只合上海中白粳米九斤了。如合北京的小站米，只合五斤多了。
    事实上，国营出版社书籍的定价都已初步降低。如以一九五一年年底书籍定价为一百，到一九五二年底，人民出版社、人民教育出版社平均降低百分之十一点八四，人民美术出版社降低百分之二十，人民文学出版社降低百分之十一，青年出版社降低百分之二十一点二四，工人出版社降低百分之十五。其他国营出版社降低百分之五至十二不等。一九五三年以来，有些国营出版社的书价续有降低。
    国营出版社出书是以满足人民群众的文化需要为原则，书籍成本虽然比战前增高，但在不断改进企业经营、提高劳动生产率、降低成本的基础上，仍能逐步降低售价。
    有些书籍，例如科技书和某些私营出版社出版的书，售价是比较高的。科技书排校所费的劳动力大，编辑加工也比较繁重，且印数较少（印数多为几千本），因而成本较高，定价也就比一般书籍为高，这是可以谅解的，但有的也超过了应有的定价。某些私营出版社的书籍定价高，主要是因为它们的书印数少，而且它们有意谋取高额利润。
    根据上述情况，目前显然不宜实行普遍减低书价的办法，而只能逐步进行局部的调整。因为如果普遍减低书价，那就是说，国家要拿一笔钱出来补贴某些国营和公私合营出版社。这虽然可以使购买书籍的读者得到便宜，但国家和人民的负担就随之加重了。所以只有在国营出版事业日益增长并不断改善企业经营、降低成本的基础上，才能逐步地适当地降低某些书籍的售价。国营出版社今后应当积极改善企业经营，提高劳动生产率，多出好书，为逐步降低书价创造条件，并适当降低某些定得过高而又有条件降低的书籍的售价。至于私营出版社书籍定价过高的现象，我们也希望出版行政机关注意加以监督。
