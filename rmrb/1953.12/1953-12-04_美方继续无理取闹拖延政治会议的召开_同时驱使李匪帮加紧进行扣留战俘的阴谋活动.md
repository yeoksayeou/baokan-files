Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 2nd: This dispatch from our special correspondent Jiang Nan reports: As expected, after a one-day recess, U.S. representative Dean continued to adopt delaying tactics in the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference, showing no indication of seriously discussing the comprehensive suggestions made by the Korean-Chinese side.

Today, Dean, citing "communication difficulties" and that there was "not enough time to allow the governments I represent to comment" on the Korean-Chinese suggestions, attempted to disregard these suggestions altogether, while continuing to harp on the same old tune of slandering the Soviet Union and attempting to turn neutral nations into puppets in the Korean political conference through various restrictions. In reality, Dean obviously did not lack time to allow the U.S.'s allied governments to "comment" on the Korean-Chinese suggestions, but rather lacked sufficient time for the U.S. to exert pressure on its allies, forcing them to oppose the Korean-Chinese suggestions along with the U.S. This is fully illustrated by the clamor issued by Syngman Rhee's lackey, Byun Yung-tai, who on the first of the month clamored that Syngman Rhee "absolutely opposes holding a conference in New Delhi, India" and that the Korean-Chinese suggestions are "completely unacceptable." The U.S. is clearly attempting once again to use Syngman Rhee as a whip to drive its allies, in order to continue delaying the convening of the political conference according to its pre-determined schedule.

Since Dean had no intention of seriously discussing the comprehensive suggestions made by the Korean-Chinese side, he came to the meeting today merely to waste time. He desperately dodged the central question of whether neutral nations would participate in the political conference, made all sorts of extremely frivolous criticisms of the Korean-Chinese suggestions, and rambled on irrelevantly, for fear of not wasting enough time. For example, he said he opposed including "other related issues" in the agenda of the political conference, because according to "modern relativity," "in politics or physics, everything is infinitely related to everything else." Dean slapped himself in the face while flaunting his "modern relativity." It is remembered that in the subcommittee meeting of the bilateral talks on November 17, Dean had put forward two so-called "suggestions," one of which advocated inviting neutral nations to participate in the conference after the political conference had resolved the Korean issue. This means that Dean admitted that the political conference should resolve other issues after resolving the Korean issue. However, Dean did not explain what issues were to be resolved at the conference after the resolution of the Korean issue, which could be interpreted as an infinite number of issues. The fourth item on the agenda of the political conference proposed by our side, "other related issues," refers to other issues related to the Korean issue. Because this is the Korean political conference, its agenda naturally falls within this scope. And the "etc." stipulated in Article 60 of the Armistice Agreement is precisely what this means. It can be seen that Dean's contradictory and deliberately distorted sophistry fully demonstrates that he is wasting time and has no intention of solving the problem.

In his lengthy, time-wasting speech, Dean continued to promote the U.S.'s so-called "freedom of the press" and opposed the provision in the Korean-Chinese suggestions that no communiqués or news should be published from closed administrative meetings without the agreement of both representatives. If one understands that the U.S. has consistently violated agreements in the past, revealing the contents of administrative meetings, then Dean's opposition is not surprising.

Today, Dean continued to oppose the Soviet Union as a neutral nation and openly stated that he would repeat the old tune of slandering the Soviet Union at tomorrow's meeting. Huang Hua, the representative of the People's Republic of China, questioned him: Why do you avoid talking about the issue of neutral nations participating as members? Does this mean that your side has agreed to the relevant clauses in our suggestion regarding this issue? Huang Hua once again reminded Dean of the clear definition of neutral nations in Article 37 of the Armistice Agreement, which originally stated "nations whose combat forces have not participated in the hostilities in Korea," and questioned Dean whether he still acknowledged the validity of the Armistice Agreement. Dean could not answer and quickly proposed an adjournment.

The situation of today's bilateral talks shows that the U.S. is determined to continue acting unreasonably and delaying the convening of the political conference. At the same time, with the support of the U.S., Syngman Rhee is stepping up preparations for forcibly detaining prisoners of war. Syngman Rhee's Public Information Office spread lies on the first of the month, slandering that the Korean-Chinese side had sent so-called "spies and special agents" to infiltrate the Panmunjom area, and openly expressed their ambition to sabotage the Korean armistice and launch another war of aggression, insisting that the Ongjin Peninsula west of the military demarcation line belonged to South Korea, and openly threatening to "take action." If the U.S. wants to delay the convening of the political conference in order to facilitate Syngman Rhee's sabotage of the Korean armistice, then they must bear absolute responsibility for the serious consequences of this behavior.

    美方继续无理取闹拖延政治会议的召开
    同时驱使李匪帮加紧进行扣留战俘的阴谋活动
    【新华社开城二日电】本社特派记者江南报道：不出所料，美方代表迪安在休会一天以后，今天仍然对关于政治会议问题的双方会谈采取拖延策略，对于朝中方面的全面建议并无认真讨论的表示。
    迪安今天藉口“由于通讯困难”，“来不及让我所代表的各国政府来评论”朝中方面的建议，企图置朝中方面的建议于不顾，而继续大唱其诬蔑苏联并企图以种种限制把中立国变成朝鲜政治会议中的木偶的滥调。实际上，迪安显然并不是因为没有时间来让美方的各国政府“评论”朝中方面的建议，而是因为没有足够的时间来让美国对它的盟国们使用压力，迫使它们和美国一起反对朝中方面的建议。可以充分说明这一点的，就是美国的走狗卞荣泰奉命发出的叫嚣。卞荣泰在一日叫嚷说，李承晚“绝对反对在印度新德里召开会议”，而且朝中方面的建议“完全是不能接受的”。美国显然企图再一次把李承晚当作驱策它的盟国的鞭子，以便继续按照预定的时间表拖延政治会议的召开。
    迪安既然不想认真讨论朝中方面的全面建议，因此他今天来开会只是为了消磨时间。他竭力闪避关于中立国是否参加政治会议这一中心问题，对朝中方面的建议作种种极端无聊的挑剔，文不对题的胡说乱扯，唯恐无法浪费时间。例如，他说他反对在政治会议的议程中列入“其他有关问题”这一项，因为根据“现代的相对论”，“在政治学上或物理学上，一切事物都是无穷尽地与其他一切事物有关的”。迪安在卖弄他的“现代的相对论”的时候，同时就在自己的脸上打了一记耳光。人们记得，在十一月十七日双方会谈的小组委员会会议中，迪安曾经提出两个所谓“建议”，其中一个是主张在政治会议解决朝鲜问题之后，可以邀请中立国参加会议。这就是说，迪安承认，政治会议在解决朝鲜问题以后，还应该解决其他问题。但迪安并未解释在解决朝鲜问题以后的会议上，是要解决什么问题，这倒可以解释成为无穷尽的问题了。而我方所提的政治会议第四项议程：其他有关问题，却是指的与朝鲜问题有关的其他问题。因为这是朝鲜政治会议，当然它的议题也属于这个范围。并且停战协定第六十款所规定的“等问题”也正是这个意思。由此可见迪安这种矛盾百出、故意曲解的诡辩，充分表现了他是在拖延时间，无意于解决问题。
    迪安在他的冗长的消磨时间的发言中，还继续宣传美国的所谓“新闻自由”，反对朝中方面建议中关于秘密性行政性会议未经双方代表协商决定时不得发表任何公报或新闻的条款。如果了解到美方过去一贯违反协议，透露行政性会议的内容，那末迪安提出这种反对，也就无足为奇了。
    迪安今天继续反对苏联作为中立国，并且公开表示他还要在明天会议上重弹诬蔑苏联的老调。中华人民共和国代表黄华责问他：为什么你对中立国作为成员参加的问题避而不谈？这是否表示你方已经同意我方建议中关于这一问题的有关条款？黄华再次提醒迪安停战协定第三十七款中关于中立国的明确定义，原“为未有战斗部队参加在朝鲜的敌对行为的国家”，并且责问迪安是否还承认停战协定有效。迪安不能回答，赶紧提议休会。
    今天双方会谈的会议情形表明：美方决心继续无理取闹，拖延政治会议的召开。同时，在美国支持之下，李承晚正在加紧从事强迫扣留战俘的准备。李承晚的公报处在一日散播谎言，诬蔑朝中方面派遣所谓“间谍特务”渗入板门店区域，而且公然表示他们企图破坏朝鲜停战，再度发动侵略战争的野心，硬指在军事分界线以西的瓮津半岛是什么属于南朝鲜的，并且公开威胁说“必须采取行动”。美国如果想以拖延政治会议的召开来便于指挥李承晚破坏朝鲜停战，那么，他们就必须对于这种行为的严重后果负起绝对的责任。
