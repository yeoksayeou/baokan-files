The Motherland is the Source of Strength
　　Wang Chengyuan

"Young man, we came to Korea and saw many heroes like you. You all look like ordinary young people, but why are you all like little tigers when you fight? Where does this energy come from?" After listening to the account of "Second-Class Combat Hero" Huang Zaiyu, of a volunteer army unit, about his combat in the counterattack south of Jin, Song Chuan-i, a 71-year-old military dependent from Liaodong Province of the third delegation to Korea, asked with great emotion.

Huang Zaiyu was stunned by this sudden question from a relative! After a while, he said: "When fighting, we often shouted: 'The time has come to perform meritorious service for the people of the motherland, the time has come to win glory for Chairman Mao,' and immediately felt that there were no insurmountable difficulties. We must overwhelm the enemy, and we must never let the enemy overwhelm us. After winning the battle, we only feel that we have fulfilled our responsibility, so many relatives are watching us!"

As Huang Zaiyu spoke, he took out a tightly wrapped letter from his pocket and said, "This is a letter of sympathy from Guangdong Province in the motherland. Our energy also comes from these letters!" Everyone scrambled to read it. The letter read: "I am a lonely old man, 59 years old this year. In the old society, people of my age were considered useless, but recently, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, I not only want to live out the rest of my life, but I also want to contribute to the country! The country called for donations of planes and cannons for the front lines, so I donated more than one million yuan of my savings. Children, just fight well on the front lines! Our people across the country are supporting you with one heart. This old man has also made up his mind that when you return home victoriously, no matter what, I will go to greet you, I must see you, these meritorious children, with my own eyes..."

As Huang Zaiyu was about to re-wrap the letter, everyone discovered that there was also a silver-white medal in the paper wrapping the letter.

A comrade from the慰问团 asked, "How did you get this?"

"This is a military medal awarded to me by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for second-class merit in a battle. I keep it with this letter, and when I return home victoriously, I will give it to that old man from Guangdong," Huang Zaiyu said.

Old man Song Chuan-i asked: "Why? The military medal is your glory, why don't you keep it for yourself?"

"Old man, you don't know how I made my contributions. It was two days before last year's National Day. Everyone was determined to present a victory to the motherland, so we took down the Five Peak Mountain guarded by a battalion of the Li pseudo-army on the east bank of the North Han River in one fell swoop. Then the enemy frantically counterattacked. At that time, a combat team of ours fought on a forward position for three days and three nights. In the end, I was the only one left on the position, and I was also wounded. However, I still persisted. At dusk, I repelled another enemy counterattack. I fainted in the bunker because of excessive blood loss. Suddenly a shout woke me up. It turned out that a group of enemies had already rushed to our position. I wanted to fight! But I had no strength at all. At that time, I forgot which pocket I took this letter from. In an instant, I seemed to see the old man, like I saw everything in the motherland... I seemed to become another person, and strength burst out all over me. I gritted my teeth and suddenly climbed up, fired a burst of bullets at the approaching enemy, and threw two grenades. As a result, more than a dozen enemies fell, and the rest retreated, and the position was held!" He paused slightly and said to Old Man Song again, "Old man, you see, it was the people of the motherland and the old man from Guangdong who supported me that I made contributions and won this military medal. Shouldn't this military medal be given to him?"

Old man Song Chuan-i listened to Huang Zaiyu's account while stroking Huang Zaiyu's shoulder. Huang Zaiyu was just 20 years old and was like a child when he came to Korea. He has become so strong after three years of fighting! He has been wounded more than once, and he has encountered so many serious difficulties, but he has never shed a tear. Now, in front of his relatives in the motherland, and under the kind caress of Old Man Song Chuan-i, tears welled up in his eyes. He quickly wiped away the tears and told another touching story.

"Speaking of the relationship between the motherland and us, let me tell you one more thing! Just before the armistice in the Jin counterattack, I took two soldiers who participated in the battle for the first time, one called Zhang Shuqing and the other called Chen Fugui, to destroy an enemy artillery group. The artillery group was surrounded by layers of barbed wire on three sides, and one side was blocked by machine gun fire. We climbed over the barbed wire layer by layer, our whole bodies were cut open, and our clothes were stained red with blood. Finally, we climbed over the last barbed wire, and threw a burst of grenades at the artillery group. Thirty or so devils concentrated here were either killed or surrendered. We shouted 'Victory, victory,' but we couldn't hear Chen Fugui's voice. After searching for a while, we found him lying next to a multi-barreled gun. I gently helped him up, and he opened his eyes slightly and said to me: 'I can't participate in the battle with everyone anymore. I have one thing, please do it for me. I have received many letters from home, each time encouraging me to make contributions, but I have never made any contributions in the past, so I have never replied. This time, if I make a contribution, please tell them. In this way, I will feel glorious.' As he spoke, he handed me a letter.

"After the battle, I took this blood-stained letter to the hospital. When I looked at it, it turned out to be a letter of sympathy. During the recuperation, I was always uneasy. I regretted that I didn't ask him for his home address at the time. After I recovered from my injuries and returned to the company, I first found the instructor and talked about this matter. The instructor checked the military registration form and told me: 'His parents were killed by the Kuomintang bandits long ago. He grew up raising pigs and cattle for others, relying on neighbors and relatives. He has no home.' I asked the instructor again: How should I write a reply to him? The instructor patted me on the shoulder and said with a smile: 'The address he sent the letter to has only two words - Motherland'..."

This is the source of strength for all volunteer soldiers, all heroes.

    祖国就是力量的源泉
    王程远
   “小伙子，我们来到朝鲜，见了好多像你这样的英雄，看起来都是普普通通的年青人，可是为什么你们打起仗来就一个个和小老虎一样，这是哪里来的劲头呢？”听了志愿军某部“二级战斗英雄”黄在渔关于自己在金城以南反击战中作战的叙述，第三届赴朝慰问团辽东省七十一岁的军属宋传义十分感慨地这样问。
    黄在渔这可被亲人突然的发问弄得愣住了！停了一会才说：“作战的时候，我们常这样喊着：‘为祖国人民立功的时候到了，为毛主席争光的时候到了’，于是立即就觉得没有克服不了的困难，我们只有压倒敌人，绝不能叫敌人压倒，打了胜仗，我们只觉得这是尽到了自己的一点责任，多少亲人在看着我们呀！”
    黄在渔说着就从衣兜里掏出一封密密层层包着的信，说道：“这是从祖国的广东省来的慰问信，我们的劲头也就从这些信里来了！”于是大家就争着看。信上写道：“我是个孤独的老头子，今年五十九岁了。在旧社会里，像我这样年岁的人就算没有用了，可是这阵子，在毛主席的领导下，我不但要好好过完这一辈子，我还要为国家出力呢！国家号召为前线捐献飞机大炮，我就把积攒下来的一百多万块钱捐了出来。孩子们，你们就只管在前线好好打吧！我们全国老百姓都是一条心地支援你们。我这老头子也下了决心，等你们胜利回国的时候，说什么我也要去迎接你们，我一定亲眼看看你们这些劳苦功高的孩子们……”
    当黄在渔准备把这封信重新包起来的时候，大家又发现那包信的纸里还放着一枚银白色的奖章。
    慰问团的同志问道：“这是怎么得来的？”
      “这是我在一次作战中立了二等功，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府赠给我的军功章。我把它和这封信放在一起保存着，等胜利回国后，我就把它送给那位广东的老大伯。”黄在渔说。
    宋传义老大爷问：“为什么？军功章是你得到的光彩，怎么不留着你自己带呢？”
    “老大爷，你不知道我是怎样立功的。那是在去年国庆节前两天，大家一心要用胜利来向祖国献礼，我们就一下子打下了北汉江东岸李伪军一个营守着的五峰山。接着敌人又拚命地反扑起来。当时，我们一个战斗小组在一处前沿阵地上战斗了三天三夜，最后阵地上只剩下我一个人，而且也负伤了。可是，我仍然坚持着。黄昏时，我又打退了敌人的一次反扑。我因为流血过多，就晕倒在掩体里了。突然一阵叫嚷把我惊醒，原来是一群敌人已经冲上了我们的阵地。我要战斗！可是，我一点力气也没有了。当时，我也忘了是从哪个口袋里掏出了这封信来。霎时间，我像看见了这位老大伯，像看到了祖国的一切……我像变成了另外一个人，混身冒出了力量。我一咬牙，就猛地爬起来，对着逼近的敌人，打了一梭子子弹，又掷了两颗手榴弹，于是，十几个敌人倒下去了，其余的敌人退走了，阵地守住了！”他稍稍停了一下，又对宋老大爷说：“老大爷，你看，这是祖国人民也是那位广东的老大伯支援着我，才立了功，才得了这个军功章。这个军功章还不应该送给他吗？”
    宋传义老大爷一边听着黄在渔的叙述，一边抚摸着黄在渔的肩膀。黄在渔刚满二十岁，到朝鲜来时，简直还是一个小孩子，在三年的战斗中，他锻炼得多么坚强啊！他不止一次负过伤，他碰到过多少次严重的困难，但他从来没有掉过一点眼泪，现在，他在祖国亲人的面前，在宋传义老大爷的亲切抚摸的时候，他的眼睛里涌出了泪水。他很快把泪水擦掉，又讲了一个动人的故事。
   “说起祖国和我们的关系，我再告诉你们这样一件事情吧！就在停战以前的金城反击战中，我带着两个第一次参加战斗的战士，一个叫张树清，一个叫陈福贵，去消灭敌人的一个炮群，炮群三面围着层层的铁丝网，一面被机枪的火力封锁着。我们就一层一层地爬过铁丝网，浑身上下都割破了，衣服都被血染红了，终于爬过最后一道铁丝网，对着炮群掷了一阵手榴弹，集中在炮群这里的三十几个鬼子有的被打死，有的投降了。我们高喊着‘胜利了，胜利了’，却听不到陈福贵的声音，找了一会，才发现他已倒在一门多管炮旁边了。我轻轻地去扶他，他微微地睁开眼对我说：‘我不能和大家一块参加战斗了。我有一件事，你替我办一办吧。我接到过家里的好多信，每一次都鼓励我立功，可是，我过去没有立过功，就始终没有回信。这次，如果我立了功，你就告诉他们一声吧。这样，我就觉得光荣了。’他说着顺手交给了我一封信。
    “战斗结束以后，我带着这封被血染红了的信到了医院，一看，原来是一封慰问信。在休养的时候，我的心里始终不安，我后悔当时没有问一问他家里的地址。我养好伤回到了连队之后，首先找到了指导员，谈了这件事，指导员查了查军人登记表，告诉我说：‘他的父母早就被国民党匪徒杀害了，他从小就给别人放猪放牛，靠邻居靠亲戚长大的，他没有家。’我又问指导员：怎样给他写回信呢？指导员拍了拍我的肩膀，笑着对我说：‘他寄信的地址，只有两个字——祖国’……”
    这就是所有志愿军战士，所有英雄们产生力量的源泉。
