Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Farmers in many regions across the country, after selling their surplus grain, are actively going to bank branches and mobile teams to repay their overdue loans. According to current incomplete statistics, the average rate of agricultural loan repayment nationwide has reached about two-thirds of the loans that are due. In the Southwest region, most areas had a bumper grain harvest this year, and farmers, after selling their surplus grain to the state, actively repaid their overdue loans. In some counties and districts of Sichuan Province, the number of repaid overdue loans has reached over 80%. Farmers in Huajiao Township, Xuanwei County, Yunnan Province, even repaid loans that were not due until the end of this year and next spring ahead of schedule. Farmers in Binnan County, Dongting Lake, Hunan Province, enthusiastically sold their surplus grain and repaid over 80% of the total agricultural loans in the county in ten days.

People's Banks in various regions have adopted many simple methods to facilitate farmers' loan repayments. Some places have adopted a system of rotating shifts to receive repayments whenever farmers arrive. Xianyang, Xingping, Liquan, Fengxiang and other counties in Shaanxi Province have also organized mobile teams to go deep into the countryside to handle loan repayment procedures for farmers. People's Banks in various regions have provided partial or full extensions or installment payment arrangements for farmers who are genuinely unable to repay their loans and for farmers whose production and livelihoods will be affected if they repay their loans.

    各地农民积极归还到期的农业贷款
    据新华社讯：全国有不少地区的农民在出售余粮后，纷纷到银行营业所、流动小组归还已经到期的贷款。根据目前不完全的统计，全国各地归还的农贷平均已达到期贷款的三分之二左右。西南区今年大部地区粮食丰收，农民在把余粮卖给国家后，积极归还到期的贷款。四川省个别县区到期贷款归还数已达百分之八十以上。云南省宣威县花椒乡的农民还提前归还了今年年底和明春才到期的贷款。湖南省洞庭湖滨南县的农民在十天中就踊跃出售余粮归还了全县农业贷款总数百分之八十以上。
    各地人民银行为便利农民归还贷款，采取了很多简便办法。有些地方采取轮流值班，随到随收的办法。陕西省咸阳、兴平、醴泉、凤翔等县还组织巡回小组深入农村办理农民归还贷款的手续。各地人民银行对确实无力归还贷款的农民，以及还贷后生产、生活将发生困难的农民，都分别给予部分或全部缓期，或分期还款的照顾。
