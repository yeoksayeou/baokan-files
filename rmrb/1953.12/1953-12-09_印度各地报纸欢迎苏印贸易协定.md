Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, December 7th: Newspapers across India continue to welcome the Soviet-Indian trade agreement.

    "The Hindu" wrote: "It is hoped that this agreement will expand the market for our jute products, tea, coffee, tobacco, hides, and leather. Several of these commodities have encountered difficulties in traditional markets."
    "The Bombay Chronicle" wrote: "The Indo-Soviet trade agreement is a 'major event,' the first real trade agreement signed with the Soviet Union." Referring to the Soviet Union's agreement to payment in rupees, the newspaper said: "This payment method has great practical benefits, which can alleviate our foreign exchange difficulties." The newspaper also pointed out: "Among all maritime nations trading with India, the Soviet Union is the only one that gives Indian ships the right to load the largest amount of exports and imports."
    "The Tribune" said: "India now has no reason not to look for new markets for its exports and import basic and other materials from anywhere it can obtain them quickly and economically. Differences in ideology do not affect international trade."
    According to the Press Trust of India, P. Ramamurti, editor of the weekly "New Century," said in Madras Province: "The Indo-Soviet trade agreement is not only an important step in expanding trade between India and the Soviet Union, but it will also play a beneficial role in creating a normal atmosphere in international relations."

    印度各地报纸欢迎苏印贸易协定
    【新华社七日讯】德里消息：印度各地方报纸继续对苏印贸易协定表示欢迎。
      “印度教徒报”写道：“人们希望这个协定将扩大我国黄麻制品、茶叶、咖啡、烟草、兽皮和皮革的市场。这些商品中有几种商品已在传统的市场上遇到了困难。”
    “孟买纪事报”写道：“印苏贸易协定具有‘大事件’的意义，这是与苏联签订的第一个真正的贸易协定。”该报在谈到苏联同意以卢比付款时说：“这种付款办法有很大的实际好处，这可减轻我国外汇的困难。”该报并指出：“在一切与印度通商的海运国家中，苏联是唯一能让印度船只有权最大量地装载输出和输入货物的一个国家。”
    “论坛报”说：“印度现在没有理由不为它的出口货寻找新的市场，并从任何它能够迅速而经济地得到基本物资和其他物资的地方输入这些物资。思想不同并不影响国际间的贸易。”
    据印度报业托辣斯消息：“新世纪”周报总编辑普·拉马穆蒂在马德拉斯省说道：“印苏贸易协定不仅在扩大印苏两国贸易方面是一个重要的步骤，就是在造成国际关系的正常气氛方面也会起有益的作用。”
