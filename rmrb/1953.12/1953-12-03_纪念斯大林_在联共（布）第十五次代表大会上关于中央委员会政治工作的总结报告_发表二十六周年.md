    Commemorating the 26th Anniversary of Stalin's "Report on the Summary of the Political Work of the Central Committee at the Fifteenth Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)"
    Zhang Jiangming
    The Fifteenth Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) was of extremely great significance in the history of the Soviet Communist Party. This congress is recorded in the history of the Soviet Communist Party as the congress of agricultural collectivization. On December 3, 1927, Stalin delivered a summary report on the political work of the Central Committee at the congress. This report occupied a major position in the entire congress and was approved by the Fifteenth Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), becoming a program of action for the struggle for socialist victory.
    In the first part of the report, Stalin made a profound Marxist-Leninist analysis of the growing crisis of world capitalism and the external situation of the Soviet Union. Under the conditions of the intensification of the general crisis of capitalism, he developed Lenin's theory of imperialism, pointed out that the internal contradictions of capitalism were intensifying, the inevitability of new imperialist wars and the increasing development of a new upsurge in the world revolutionary movement, and put forward the policy of continuing to maintain peace and consolidate national defense.
    Since the Fourteenth Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), convened in December 1925, the period of struggle for socialist national industrialization had begun. In the second part of his report at the Fifteenth Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), Stalin made a basic summary of socialist construction over the past two years, pointed out the great achievements in industrialization and various tasks, stipulated the tasks for further development of the national economy, put forward the policy of agricultural collectivization, and guided socialist construction to a new stage.
    In the summer of 1926, Trotskyites and Zinovievites formed an anti-Party alliance, attacking the Party's general line of socialist industrialization and publishing a most hypocritical program. Two months before the Fifteenth Congress, a debate was conducted throughout the Party. The result of this debate was a tragic defeat for the opposition alliance. In the third part of the report, Stalin summarized the intra-Party debate, clarified the basic differences between the Party and the opposition, thoroughly crushed the opposition alliance of Trotskyites and Zinovievites politically and organizationally, and enabled the entire Party to achieve unprecedented ideological and organizational unity, uniting wholeheartedly around the Central Committee headed by Stalin, overcoming countless difficulties, and advancing victoriously along the socialist road. In this report, when analyzing the internal situation of the Soviet Union at that time, Stalin pointed out that the great achievements of the Soviet people in socialist economic construction were marked by accelerating the speed of industrial development, following the road of socialist industrialization, and ensuring that the proportion of the socialist sector in the national economy increased day by day.
    The increase in the total output of the Soviet Union's national economy in the past two years was very rapid. There was vigorous development in industry, agriculture, commerce, and railway transportation, thus making the Soviet Union "increasingly an industrial country." Facts show that the socialist industrialization policy stipulated by Stalin, that is, the road of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, relying on internal accumulation sources, and carrying out socialist industrialization based on the domestic market, is the only correct road that has been tested. Stalin's theory of socialist industrialization is a major contribution to Marxism-Leninism.
    During this period, the development of heavy industry, that is, the growth of the production of means of production, was particularly rapid, occupying a priority position. The proportion of the production of means of production in state-owned large-scale industry increased from 42 percent in 1924-1925 to 44 percent in 1926-1927. This speed could not be achieved by any capitalist country.
    Stalin pointed out in the report that the decisive factors in the development of the national economy in the past two years were the following two basic situations: "First, the development process of our national economy occurred under the sign of national industrialization, and under the sign of the continuous increase of the role of industry in agriculture. Second, the direction of national economic development and national industrialization is to increase the proportion and commanding role of socialist economic forms in production and commodity circulation, while reducing the proportion of private commodity production and the capitalist part." This is the guiding principle for the Soviet Union to carry out socialist economic construction, and the direction followed by the rapid development of the Soviet Union's national economy. It is precisely because the Soviet Union strictly followed this direction to carry out socialist industrialization that it was able to gradually transition to a socialist society. The great achievements of Soviet industrialization enabled the Soviet regime to achieve decisive success in solving the problem of "who will defeat whom." At this time, the problem of "who will defeat whom" had a different nature. Stalin said: "Now this problem has shifted from the commercial aspect to the production aspect, to the handicraft production aspect and the agricultural production aspect."
    Based on the development of national income and the entire industry in the past two years, Stalin compared it with capitalist countries, explaining that the growth rate of socialist industry broke historical records, thus concluding: "Directly and unequivocally prove that the Soviet production system is superior to the capitalist production system."
    For example, the Soviet Union's national income increased by 29.9 percent in 1925-1926 and 11.4 percent in 1926-1927. The average annual growth rate of the United States' national income was only 3 to 4 percent, while the annual growth rate of the national income of other countries such as Britain and Germany was only 1 to 3 percent. In terms of industrial output, the average annual growth rate of the Soviet Union reached about 12 percent, while the growth rate of the United States was 8.2 percent between 1890 and 1895, 5.2 percent between 1895 and 1900, and 2.6 percent between 1900 and 1905.
    So, why can socialist industry develop at a high speed? Where is the superiority of the socialist production system over the capitalist production system manifested?
    Stalin comprehensively elaborated on the great superiority of the socialist production system over the capitalist production system, and pointed out the reasons why socialism can use this superiority to develop industry at a high speed:
    First, socialist industry is nationalized industry. It produces to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society.
    Second, socialist industry is the largest and most concentrated industry in the world. On a highly technical basis, it continuously increases and improves socialist production, enabling the productive forces to develop at an unprecedented speed.
    Third, socialist industry is led by the Soviet government as a unified industrial economy, and is carried out in accordance with the laws of planned (proportional) development, which multiplies its development speed.
    Fourth, socialist industry can implement a correct policy—the policy of continuously reducing the prices of industrial products, continuously expanding the domestic market, and rapidly developing industrial production. This is fundamentally impossible in capitalist countries.
    Fifth, socialist industry brings the relationship between urban and rural areas and the relationship between workers and peasants closer, and gradually eliminates the essential differences between urban and rural areas and between workers and peasants, further merging into one. Capitalism, on the contrary, deepens the opposition between urban and rural areas, splits the unity between workers and peasants, and lives by cruelly exploiting the workers and peasants.
    Sixth, the development of socialist industry is completely consistent with the interests of the working class. It relies on the working class and continuously improves labor productivity by adopting production rationalization methods. This is also a phenomenon that cannot exist under the capitalist system.
    The road of industrialization in our country is the road of the Soviet Union. Stalin's theory of socialist industrialization has great practical guiding significance for us. We must follow the direction pointed out by Stalin to carry out the country's socialist industrialization.
    Today, the people's economy of our country is an economy of a transitional nature. We recognize the infinite superiority of the socialist economic system, recognize the advantages of socialist industrialization and its high-speed development. When carrying out industrialization, we must follow the road of socialist industrialization, not the road of capitalist industrialization. If we adopt capitalist methods to industrialize, that would be retrogression and backwardness. Only by following the road of socialist industrialization, ensuring the leading role of industry in the entire national economy, and ensuring that the proportion of the socialist form of economy increases day by day, until it finally becomes the only social economic form, can we guarantee national independence, transform the entire national economy, victoriously complete the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce, continuously improve the material and cultural living standards of the people, and gradually transition to a socialist society.
    The basic tasks of our country's first five-year plan are: to concentrate the main forces on developing heavy industry, establishing the foundation for national industrialization and national defense modernization; to correspondingly train construction talents, develop transportation, light industry, agriculture, and commerce; to promote the cooperation of agriculture and handicrafts step by step, continue to transform private industry and commerce, correctly exert the role of individual peasants, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce; to ensure the steady growth of the proportion of socialist components in the national economy, and to ensure the gradual improvement of the people's material and cultural living standards on the basis of developing production. This is determined based on the great theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin combined with the actual situation in China. This is the practical application of Stalin's theory of socialist economic construction in China. We must actively study Stalin's theory of national socialist industrialization to guide and promote our country's industrial construction and strive for the great goal of socialist industrialization.
    At the time of the Fifteenth Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), the Soviet Union's socialist industrialization achieved unprecedented high-speed development, but the development speed of agriculture was relatively slow. Although agricultural production as a whole had exceeded the pre-war level at that time, and the annual growth rate of the total agricultural output of capitalist Russia was higher, its main sector—the total output of grain—was still behind the pre-war level. Especially the marketable grain part of the grain industry was only equal to 37 percent of the pre-war level. Undoubtedly, if "the state of the grain industry is allowed to continue, then the Soviet army and urban residents will be in a state of constant hunger." ("History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)") Moreover, behind the grain crisis, there must be a livestock crisis following; and it will threaten the development of the entire national economy, and there is a danger of causing a split between the urban economy and the rural economy.
    Under this circumstance, efforts must be made to overcome the excessive backwardness of agricultural development as soon as possible, otherwise, this will hinder the high tide of industry and the consolidation of the Soviet economic foundation, and it will hinder the further improvement of the lives of the workers and peasants.
    When analyzing the agricultural situation in the report, Stalin pointed out that the reason why the development speed of agriculture was slower than the development speed of industry was that agricultural technology was too backward and the cultural level in rural areas was very low. In particular, the process of breaking up huge commodity economic units into small economic units in the countryside, and then breaking up small economic units into extremely small units, which began in 1918, continued. For example, there were 1.5 to 1.6 million peasant households before the revolution, but there were 24 to 2.5 million peasant households in 1928. This small peasant economy cannot have the various great advantages of nationalized industry, cannot be united and operated according to plan, cannot use agricultural machinery and scientific achievements, but is operated on scattered and divided countless small pieces of land, unable to resist natural disasters, subject to spontaneous forces, and bankrupted by the exploitation of rich peasants. Therefore, the productivity of the small peasant economy is very low. Most of it can only carry out simple reproduction, and there is very little marketable grain. It is a "semi-consumption economy"; and after the victory of the revolution, the small peasants were freed from the exploitation of landlords, and their lives were greatly improved. They consumed more agricultural products themselves than before, so there was even less marketable grain that could be sold. "This is the fundamental reason for our difficulties in solving the food problem." ("The Problem of Socialist Construction in the Soviet Union")
    So, how to overcome the slow development of agriculture? What is the way out for agriculture?
    At that time, there were two roads in front of the Soviet Union: one was to take the capitalist road, that is, to develop agriculture by capitalist methods, but its "result would be to bankrupt the peasant masses, destroy the worker-peasant alliance, strengthen the rich peasant forces, and cause socialism to fail in the countryside" ("History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)"). The other was to take the socialist road, gradually uniting small peasant households into collective farms through cooperatives. This road is able to use tractors and modern machinery to produce, gradually improve the lives of peasants, and everyone lives a happy life of abundance; and can quickly increase agricultural output, especially the production of grain and marketable grain, to support industrial construction and supply the needs of urban development. This is the only correct road. Stalin said:
    "The way out is to unite the scattered small farms into large farms on the basis of public cultivation, and to implement collective cultivation on the basis of new and higher technologies.
    The way out is to gradually, but consistently, not by compulsory means, but by methods of commendation and persuasion, unite small and very small farms into large farms, based on public common cultivation, and collective cultivation, while adopting agricultural machinery and tractors, and adopting scientific methods to increase agricultural intensity."
    The road of collective farms is to make peasants forever free from poverty and bankruptcy, to make the socialist transformation of agriculture victorious, to raise the peasant economy to a higher level, and to promote the victorious advance of the entire national economy.
    After comprehensively analyzing the situation in the countryside and its way out, Stalin put forward an urgent and practical task to the entire Party, that is: "Gradually transfer the scattered peasant economy to the track of united and huge farms, to the track of public collective cultivation based on agricultural intensification and mechanization." This road is an extremely important means to accelerate the development speed of agriculture and completely overcome the capitalist elements in the countryside.
    After summarizing the achievements of economic construction, and then talking about the political situation, Stalin used the Marxist-Leninist method of class analysis to clarify the trends of various classes, and put forward the tasks in the political aspect based on the actual situation of these trends.
    With the development of large-scale industry, the number of the working class is constantly increasing. Under the restoration of agriculture and the development of commodity circulation, differentiation occurred within the peasants. But the differentiation under the proletarian dictatorship and the differentiation under the capitalist system are fundamentally different. On the basis of production development, the material and cultural lives of workers and peasants are gradually improving. Stalin quoted a large amount of material to illustrate this problem, and pointed out that the task in the future is to continue to implement the policy of further improving the material conditions and cultural conditions of the working class, the basic peasant masses, especially the rural poor, consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, and enhancing the prestige of the working class and its party in the countryside.
    Regarding the situation of the new bourgeoisie and the intellectuals, Stalin deeply analyzed their characteristics, pointed out the root of the new bourgeoisie's dissatisfaction and the facts of the differentiation of the intellectuals, and proposed to continue to implement the policy of isolating the new bourgeoisie, and consolidate the combination between the working class and the urban and rural Soviet laboring intellectuals.
    Regarding the issue of state organs and the struggle against bureaucracy, Stalin made a detailed analysis and combined the anti-bureaucracy with the slogan of cultural revolution put forward by Lenin. Stalin pointed out that the strength of the state organs lies in combining the regime with millions of workers and peasants through the Soviets. But at that time, there were bureaucrats in the state organs who corrupted and distorted the work of the state organs, causing isolation from the masses. Therefore, it is necessary to systematically improve the state organs and make them close to the masses. But to completely overcome the bureaucracy in the state organs, it is necessary to improve the cultural level of the workers and peasants and absorb them into the management of the state. Because "improving the cultural level of workers and peasants is one of the most reliable ways to eliminate bureaucracy." The task of the Party is: to burn away the bureaucracy in the work with hot iron bars, and to intensify the struggle to improve the cultural level of the working class and the laboring peasant class.
    When summing up the domestic political situation and drawing conclusions, Stalin said: "The Soviet regime is the most solid regime in the world." Its solidity is beyond the reach of any bourgeois regime.
    The road of agricultural development pointed out by Stalin in the report is exactly the road that our country's agriculture should take. An important part of our Party's general line in the transition period is to carry out socialist transformation of agriculture, so that individual peasants can take the road of cooperatives to collectivization.
    The individual economy of peasants is an economy standing at the crossroads. It may develop to capitalism, or it may develop to socialism. According to its spontaneous forces, it is accustomed to taking the former road, because the peasant small commodity economy and the capitalist economy are basically similar economies (of course, it does not mean that the peasant economy is the capitalist economy). They are all based on private ownership. To make agriculture develop to socialism, it is necessary to carry out socialist transformation of the peasant individual economy. Only by taking the socialist road can the peasants be completely liberated, and can the improvement of material and cultural life be fundamentally improved. This is the only bright road for all peasants.
    The method of carrying out socialist transformation of the peasant individual economy is to actively carry out the mutual aid and cooperation movement in rural areas (including supply and marketing, credit, and production cooperatives), and gradually transform the peasant individual economy into the collective ownership of cooperatives, so that the backward and scattered small peasant economy becomes the advanced cooperative socialist agricultural economy.
    When carrying out the mutual aid and cooperation movement, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, and not to be impatient and rash, but also not to let it go. It is necessary to strengthen the leadership and education of the peasants, and gradually improve according to the degree of awareness of the peasants and the development of work, and gradually change from low-level forms to high-level forms.
    To make the peasants take the socialist road well, it is necessary to vigorously publicize the Party's general line in the transition period to the peasants, so that every peasant understands our country's general line and general tasks in the transition period, understands why socialist industrialization is implemented and the benefits of national industrialization to the peasants, understands why socialist transformation is implemented in agriculture and how to implement socialist transformation, understands the relationship between socialist industrialization and agricultural socialist transformation, and the responsibility of the peasants for national industrialization; and can earnestly strive to increase the production of grain and other agricultural products, and, in addition to enough for their own consumption, enthusiastically sell the grain needed by the country to the country. This is the practical action of the peasants to actively support socialist industrialization, and it is also the great contribution of the peasants to national construction.

    纪念斯大林“在联共（布）第十五次代表大会上关于中央委员会政治工作的总结报告”发表二十六周年
    张江明
    联共（布）第十五次代表大会在苏联共产党历史上有着极重大的意义。这次代表大会，是作为农业集体化代表大会而载入苏联共产党史册的。一九二七年十二月三日斯大林在大会上作了关于中央委员会政治工作的总结报告，这个报告在整个代表大会中占着主要的地位，并为联共（布）第十五次代表大会所批准，成为为社会主义胜利而斗争的行动纲领。
    斯大林在报告的第一部分中，对世界资本主义的日益增长的危机和苏联的外部状况，作了深刻的马克思列宁主义的分析，在资本主义总危机尖锐化的条件下，发展了列宁关于帝国主义的理论，指出了资本主义的内部矛盾正在加剧，新的帝国主义战争的不可避免性和世界革命运动新高涨日益发展，提出了继续维护和平与巩固国防的政策。
    从一九二五年十二月召开的联共（布）第十四次代表大会后，就进入了为社会主义的国家工业化而斗争的时期。斯大林在联共（布）第十五次代表大会上的报告中的第二部分中，对两年来社会主义建设作了基本总结，指出了在工业化和各项工作中的巨大成绩，规定了进一步发展国民经济的任务，提出了农业集体化的方针，把社会主义建设引导到一个新的阶段。
    一九二六年夏，托洛茨基分子和季诺维也夫分子结成了一个反党联盟，向着党的社会主义工业化的总路线横加攻击，并公布了一个最虚伪的政纲，在第十五次代表大会前两个月，进行了全党的争论，这次争论的结果使反对派联盟遭到了极悲惨的失败。斯大林在报告的第三部分中，作了关于党内争论的总结，阐明了党与反对派间的基本分歧，从政治上和组织上彻底粉碎了托洛茨基分子和季诺维也夫分子的反对派联盟，使全党在思想上和组织上达到空前的统一，同心同德地团结在以斯大林为首的中央委员会的周围，克服了无数困难，沿着社会主义的道路胜利前进。斯大林在这一报告中分析当时苏联内部状况时指出，苏联人民进行社会主义经济建设所获得的巨大成就，是以加快工业发展的速度，按照社会主义工业化的道路，保证国民经济中社会主义部分所占比重日益增长为标志而进行的。
    两年来苏联全部国民经济生产量的增加是很迅速的，无论在工业、农业、商业和铁路运输业诸方面，都有蓬勃的发展，因而使苏联“日益成为工业国”。事实说明，斯大林规定的社会主义工业化方针，即首先发展重工业，依靠内部的积累来源，以国内市场为基地来进行社会主义工业化的道路，是经过考验的唯一正确的道路。斯大林的社会主义工业化理论，是对于马克思列宁主义的重大贡献。
    在这时期，发展得特别迅速的是重工业，即生产资料生产的增长占着优先的地位。生产资料的生产在国营大工业中所占的比重，在一九二四至一九二五年度为百分之四十二，一九二六至一九二七年度则增加到百分之四十四。这种速度是任何资本主义国家绝不能达到的。
    斯大林在报告中指出，两年来国民经济发展方面的决定性因素是如下两个基本情况：“第一、我国国民经济发展进程是在国家工业化标志下发生的，是在工业对于农业的作用不断增加的标志下发生的。第二、国民经济发展和国家工业化的方向是使社会主义经济形式在生产方面和商品流转方面所占比重及指挥作用增长起来，而使私人商品生产部分和资本主义部分底比重减低下去。”这是苏联进行社会主义经济建设的指导原则，是苏联国民经济迅速发展所循的方向。正由于苏联严格地遵循着这方向进行社会主义工业化，它就能够逐步过渡到社会主义社会。苏联工业化的巨大成就，便使得苏维埃政权在解决“谁战胜谁”的问题方面达到了具有决定意义的成功。这时候，“谁战胜谁”的问题已具有另一种性质了。斯大林说：“现今这个问题已从商业方面移到了生产方面，移到了手工业生产方面和农业生产方面”了。
    斯大林根据两年来国民收入和全部工业的发展，同资本主义国家进行比较，说明社会主义工业的增长速度是打破历史记录的，从而得出结论：“直接而不容置疑地证明苏维埃生产体系优胜于资本主义生产体系”。
    例如，苏联国民收入，在一九二五至一九二六年度增加了百分之二十九点九，在一九二六至一九二七年度增加了百分之十一点四。而美国国民收入平均每年增长率不过百分之三至四，其他英德等国国民收入每年增长率不过百分之一至三罢了。在工业出产量方面，苏联每年平均增长率约达百分之十二，而美国的增长率在一八九○至一八九五年间为百分之八点二，在一八九五至一九○○年间为百分之五点二，在一九○○至一九○五年间为百分之二点六。
    那末，为什么社会主义工业能够高速度发展？社会主义生产体系优越于资本主义生产体系表现在什么地方呢？
    斯大林全面地阐明社会主义生产体系较资本主义生产体系的巨大优越性，并指出了社会主义能够利用这种优越性来高速度发展工业的原因：
    第一、社会主义工业是国有化的工业。它是为了保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化需要而进行生产的。
    第二、社会主义工业是世界上最大和最集中的工业，它在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善，使生产力获得空前速度的发展。
    第三、社会主义工业是在苏维埃政府领导下当作统一的工业经济来领导，依照有计划的（按比例）发展法则来进行，这就使它的发展速度加强许多倍。
    第四、社会主义工业能够实行一种正确政策——不断降低工业品价格的政策，使国内市场不断扩大，使工业生产得到迅速发展。这在资本主义国家是根本不可能的。
    第五、社会主义工业使城乡关系和工农关系更加接近，并逐步消灭城乡和工农之间的本质差别，进一步溶成一体。而资本主义则与此相反，它是加深城乡间的对立，分裂工农间的团结，靠残酷地剥削工农群众而过活的。
    第六、社会主义工业的发展和工人阶级的利益完全一致。它依靠工人阶级，采用生产合理化的办法而不断提高劳动生产率。这也是在资本主义制度下根本不能有的现象。
    我们中国工业化的道路是走苏联的道路。斯大林的社会主义工业化理论，对我们有着极大的现实的指导意义。我们必须遵循着斯大林指出的方向来进行国家的社会主义工业化。
    今天我国的人民经济，是一种过渡性质的经济。我们认识了社会主义经济制度的无限优越性，认识了社会主义工业化的优点及其高速度的发展，在进行工业化的时候，就必须走社会主义工业化的道路，而不能走资本主义工业化的道路。如果采用资本主义的办法来工业化，那就是倒退和落后。只有走社会主义工业化的道路，保证工业在全部国民经济中的领导作用，保证社会主义形式的经济所占比重日益增长，以至最后成为唯一的社会经济形式，才能保障国家的独立，才能改造整个国家经济，胜利地完成对农业、对手工业、对私营工商业的社会主义改造，才能不断提高人民的物质生活和文化生活水平，才能逐步地过渡到社会主义社会。
    我国第一个五年计划的基本任务是：集中主要力量发展重工业，建立国家工业化和国防现代化的基础；相应地培养建设人材，发展交通运输业、轻工业、农业和商业；有步骤地促进农业、手工业的合作化，继续进行对私营工商业的改造，正确地发挥个体农民、手工业和私营工商业的作用；保证国民经济中社会主义成份的比重稳步增长，保证在发展生产的基础上逐步提高人民物质生活和文化生活的水平。这是根据马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的伟大学说结合中国的实际情况而定出来的。这是把斯大林的社会主义经济建设理论在中国的实际应用。我们要积极学习斯大林的国家社会主义工业化的理论，以指导和推动我国的工业建设，为社会主义工业化的远大目标而奋斗。
    在联共（布）第十五次代表大会时，苏联社会主义工业化获得了空前高速度的发展，但在农业的发展速度上却比较迟慢。虽然当时农业生产就整个来说已超过战前水平，并较资本主义俄国农业总产量每年增长率为高。可是它的主要部门——谷物业的出产总量，还是落后于战前水平，尤其是在谷物业中的商品粮食部分，只等于战前水平的百分之三十七。毫无疑义，如果“让谷物业所处的这种状况继续下去，那苏联的军队和城市居民就会陷于经常挨饿的境地。”（“联共（布）党史”）而且在谷物业危机后面，一定会有畜物业危机跟着发生；并会威胁着整个国民经济的发展，有造成使城市经济和农村经济发生分裂的危险。
    在这种情况之下，必须努力尽快克服农业发展的过度落后性，不然，这就会妨碍工业的高涨和苏维埃经济基础的巩固，就会妨碍工农群众生活的进一步改善。
    斯大林在报告中分析农业状况时指出：农业发展速度较工业发展速度缓慢的原因，乃是当时农业技术过分落后和农村文化水准非常低落，特别是由于从一九一八年开始在农村中发生的那种巨大商品经济单位碎裂为细小经济单位，再由细小经济单位碎裂为极小单位的过程，仍然继续着。例如在革命前有一千五、六百万农户，一九二八年却有二千四、五百万农户。这种小农经济，不能像国有化工业那样拥有种种巨大优势，不能联合一致按照计划经营，不能利用农业机器和科学成就，而是在散漫的分成无数小块的土地上经营，无力抵抗自然的灾害，受着自发势力的支配，和富农的剥削而陷于破产。所以，小农经济的生产力很低，大部分只能进行简单的再生产，商品粮食很少，是一种“半消费性的经济”；并且在革命胜利后，小农解除了地主的剥削，大大的改善了生活，其自己所消费的农产品比以前更多，这样，能够拿出来卖的商品粮也就更少了。“这就是在解决粮食问题上我们困难的根本所在。”（“苏联社会主义建设底问题”）
    那末，如何克服农业发展的迟慢？农业的出路何在呢？
    当时摆在苏联面前的有两条道路：一条是走资本主义的道路，即用资本主义的办法来发展农业，但其“结果就会使农民大众遭到破产，使工农联盟陷于灭亡，使富农势力加强并使社会主义在农村中遭到失败”（“联共（布）党史”）。另一条是走社会主义的道路，经过合作社逐步地把小农户联合为集体农庄。这条道路是能够运用拖拉机及现代化机器来生产，使农民的生活逐步改善，大家过着丰衣足食的幸福生活；并能迅速提高农业产量，尤其是谷物以及商品粮食的出产，以支援工业建设和供应城市发展的需要。这是一条唯一正确的道路。斯大林说：
    “出路就在于用公共耕种制做基础来把零散的小农庄联合为大农庄，用新的更高的技术做基础来实行集体耕种制。
    出路就在于循序渐进，然而一贯到底地，不是用强迫办法，而是用表彰和说服方法，把小的和极小的农庄联合为大的农庄，以公共的共耕式的集体的耕种制做基础，同时采用农业机器和拖拉机，采用增加农业强度的科学方法。”
    集体农庄的道路，就是使农民永远脱离贫穷破产，使农业的社会主义改造获得胜利，把农民经济提到一个更高的水平，推动整个国民经济的胜利前进。
    斯大林在全面分析了农村的状况及其出路以后，向全党提出了一个迫切而实际的任务，就是：“逐渐把散漫的农民经济转移到联合的巨大的农庄轨道上来，转移到以农业强度化和机械化为基础的公共集体耕种制轨道上来”。这条道路是加速农业发展速度和彻底克服农村中资本主义成分的极重要手段。
    斯大林在总结了经济建设的成绩，进而说到政治状况时，以马克思列宁主义的阶级分析方法阐明了各个阶级的动向，并从这些动向的实际情况出发提出了在政治方面的任务。
    随着大工业的发展，工人阶级的数目不断增加。而在农业恢复和商品流转发展之下，农民的内部发生了分化。但在无产阶级专政下的分化和在资本主义制度下的分化是根本不同的。在生产发展的基础上，工人和农民的物质生活与文化生活逐步提高。斯大林引用了大量的材料来说明这问题，并指出今后的任务，是继续执行更加改善工人阶级、基本农民群众，特别是农村贫民的物质状况和文化状况的方针，巩固工农联盟，提高工人阶级及其政党在农村中的威信。
    关于新资产阶级和知识界的情况，斯大林深刻地分析了他们的特点。指出新资产阶级不满情绪的根源以及知识界分化的事实，提出要继续执行孤立新资产阶级的方针，并巩固工人阶级与城乡苏维埃劳动知识界间的结合。
    对于国家机关与反官僚主义斗争的问题，斯大林作了详尽的分析，并把反官僚主义和列宁提出的文化革命口号结合起来。斯大林指出，国家机关的力量在于经过苏维埃把政权和千百万工农群众结合起来。但当时在国家机关中却存在有官僚主义分子，他们败坏和歪曲国家机关的工作，造成与群众的隔离。因此，必须有系统地改善国家机关，使它与群众接近。但是要彻底克服国家机关中的官僚主义，必须提高工农群众的文化程度，吸收他们参加国家的管理工作。因为“提高工农文化水准是消除官僚主义的一种最可靠的办法”。党的任务就是：要用火热的铁条烧除掉工作中的官僚主义，加紧为提高工人阶级和劳动农民阶层的文化程度而斗争。
    在总结了国内政治状况而得出结论时，斯大林说：“苏维埃政权乃是全世界所有一切政权中最坚固的政权。”它的坚固性是任何一个资产阶级政权所望尘莫及的。
    斯大林在报告中指出的农业发展的道路正是我国农业要走的道路。我们党在过渡时期中的总路线的重要一部分，就是对农业实行社会主义改造，使个体农民经过合作社的道路走到集体化。
    农民的个体经济是站在十字路口的经济，它可能发展到资本主义，也可能发展到社会主义。如果按照它的自发势力来说，它是习惯于走前一条道路的，因为农民小商品经济和资本主义经济基本上是同类的经济（当然，并不是说农民经济就是资本主义经济），它们都是以私有制为基础的。要使农业发展到社会主义，这就必须对农民个体经济实行社会主义改造。农民只有走社会主义的道路才能得到彻底的解放，才能使物质生活和文化生活的提高得到根本的改善。这是全体农民的唯一光明大路。
    对农民个体经济实行社会主义改造的办法，就是积极的在农村中开展互助合作运动（包括供销的、信贷的和生产的合作社），逐步地把农民的个体经济改造为合作社的集体所有制，使落后的分散的小农经济变为先进的合作化的社会主义农业经济。
    在进行互助合作运动时，必须坚持自愿互利原则，不可急躁冒进，但也不可放任自流。要加强对农民的领导和教育，根据农民的觉悟程度和工作的发展逐步提高，由低级形式一步步地变为高级形式。
    要使农民很好地走社会主义的道路，必须大张旗鼓地向农民宣传党在过渡时期的总路线，使每个农民都懂得我国在过渡时期的总路线和总任务，懂得为什么要实行社会主义工业化及国家工业化对农民的好处，懂得为什么要对农业实行社会主义改造及如何实行社会主义改造，懂得社会主义工业化和农业社会主义改造的关系，以及农民对于国家工业化的责任；并且能够切实努力增产粮食和其他农业品，除了够自己的吃用以外，踊跃地把国家所需要的粮食卖给国家。这就是农民积极支援社会主义工业化的实际行动，也是农民对于国家建设的伟大贡献。
