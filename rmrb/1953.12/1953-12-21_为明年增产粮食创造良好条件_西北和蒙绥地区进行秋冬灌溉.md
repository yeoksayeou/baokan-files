In the Northwest provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Suiyuan Province, areas with water conservancy conditions, under the leadership and assistance of Party and government organs at all levels, have mostly completed or exceeded their farmland irrigation tasks, creating favorable conditions for increasing grain production next year.

Gansu, Ningxia, Xinjiang, and other provinces issued instructions in September and October, requiring cadres at all levels to seize the opportunity and lead the masses in autumn and winter irrigation work as soon as possible, laying the foundation for increased production next year. The water conservancy bureaus of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Gansu Province, and Shanba Special District of Suiyuan Province also held meetings of county and banner-level water conservancy cadres in September to summarize experiences and formulate autumn irrigation and winter watering plans. Before the start of irrigation, various localities also dispatched Party and government cadres to cooperate with water conservancy technicians to go deep into the masses to mobilize the repair of dikes and canals, so as to irrigate on time. Thanks to good preparatory work, irrigation began around mid-October in various places. In the Inner Mongolia region, as of early November, a total of more than 13,000 hectares of land had been irrigated, exceeding this year's autumn irrigation plan and more than 4,000 hectares more than last year. In the Suiyuan Province’s Yellow River coastal irrigation areas, the original plan was to irrigate 3.76 million mu of land in the autumn, but the actual area irrigated exceeded 4.1 million mu. The Sanhu River irrigation area combined irrigation with flood prevention, completing not only the original target of 150,000 mu but also exceeding it by 70,000 mu. As of November 4, the irrigated area in Shanba Special District had reached 90% of the area that should be irrigated. In Ningxia Province, due to the in-depth propaganda and education carried out by cadres in rural areas to address the farmers' thinking of wading through "ice-water" and "snowflake-water," the farmers' waiting mentality was overcome. Irrigation began on October 10, and by November 19, more than 1.9 million mu of paddy fields throughout the province had been smoothly watered for the winter. In many parts of Gansu Province, winter irrigation has also been completed or the winter irrigation area has been expanded. Anxi County in the province learned from last year's lesson that some areas were not irrigated in the winter, affecting spring plowing and sowing. This year, irrigation started as early as the beginning of October. By the beginning of November, all 108,000 mu of irrigated land in the county had been watered for the winter, and some of the land that had been watered earlier was re-irrigated. Dingxi, Yongdeng, Lintao and other counties have also watered the winter. In some areas of Jingyuan, Yuzhong, and Minle counties, the irrigation area has also been expanded. Xiaba Township in Yuzhong improved water regulations, and the irrigation area increased by 30% compared with last year. Seventeen villages near Tongziba in Minle County implemented centralized rotational irrigation and changed the old habit of not irrigating after frost. The irrigation area increased by more than 1,500 mu compared with last year. Jingyuan No. 7 District repaired dikes in advance to reduce water waste during irrigation. Ninety-five percent of the irrigated land in the district had sufficient winter water, expanding the irrigation area by about 1,500 mu compared to previous years. In Shaanxi Province, where the temperature is higher, farmers in the Luohui, Weihui, and Suihui canal irrigation areas are also repairing canals and leveling land in preparation for irrigation.

Some shortcomings also exist in various places' farmland irrigation: some areas have not properly implemented the shallow and quick rotation irrigation system from bottom to top, resulting in excessive watering depth and frequency, and even flooding of beaches and roads; some areas, due to two heavy snowfalls in early winter, believed that there would be no more drought, so they relaxed irrigation. The leadership in these areas has paid attention to this and is educating the masses to seize the time to water in winter and fully prepare for spring irrigation next year.

    为明年增产粮食创造良好条件
    西北和蒙绥地区进行秋冬灌溉
    西北各省和内蒙古自治区、绥远省的有水利条件的地区，在各级党、政机关的领导和帮助下，大部已完成或超额完成耕地浇灌任务，为明年增产粮食创造了良好的条件。
    甘肃、宁夏、新疆等省在九、十月间都先后发出指示，要求各级干部抓紧时机，及早领导群众进行秋、冬季浇灌工作，为明年增产打下基础。内蒙古自治区、甘肃省和绥远省陕坝专区等水利局并在九月间召开县、旗水利干部会议，总结经验，订出秋浇冬灌的计划。在开始浇灌之前，各地还抽调党、政干部配合水利技术人员深入群众动员整修堤坝和渠道，以便按时浇灌。由于准备工作做得好，各地在十月中旬前后都已开始浇灌。内蒙地区截至十一月初止，共已浇地一万三千多垧，超过今年秋浇计划，比去年多浇四千多垧。绥远省黄河沿岸各灌区原计划秋浇地三百七十六万亩，实际已浇四百一十多万亩。三湖河灌区做到了灌溉与防汛相结合，除完成十五万亩原定任务外，又超额完成了七万亩。陕坝专区截至十一月四日止，浇地面积已达应浇地百分之九十。宁夏省由于干部深入农村针对农民淌“冰凌水”、“雪花水”的思想进行宣传教育，克服了农民的等待思想，从十月十日开始灌溉，到十一月十九日全省一百九十多万亩水田已顺利地灌完了冬水。甘肃省很多地方也都完成冬季灌溉或扩大了冬季灌溉面积。该省安西县接受去年部分地区没浇上冬水影响了春耕下种的教训，今年提前于十月初就开始灌溉，到十一月初，全县十万八千多亩水地已全部灌上冬水，有些还把早浇过的地又重浇了一次。定西、永登、临洮等县水地也都灌了冬水。靖远、榆中、民乐等县部分地区还扩大了灌溉面积。榆中下坝乡改进了水规，灌溉面积比去年增加了百分之三十。民乐县童子坝附近十七个村，实行集中轮灌，并改变了霜后不浇的旧习惯，灌溉面积比去年增加一千五百多亩。靖远七区事先修好堤坝，减少浇灌中的费水现象，全区百分之九十五的水地都浇足了冬水，比往年扩大了灌溉面积一千五百亩左右。气温较高的陕西省洛惠、渭惠、绥惠等渠道灌区的农民也在修渠整地，准备灌溉。
    各地在浇灌耕地方面也存在着一些缺点：有些地区对浅浇快轮、由下到上的轮灌制度没有很好贯彻，以致浇水过深、次数过多，甚至发生淹滩漫路的现象；部分地区因初冬下了两次大雪，认为不会再旱，便放松了浇灌。这些地区的领导上已引起注意，教育群众抓紧冬季浇水，并充分做好明年春季浇水的准备工作。
