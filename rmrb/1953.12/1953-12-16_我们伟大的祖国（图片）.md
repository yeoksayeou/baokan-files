    Our Great Motherland
    The state-owned Sartu livestock farm has over a thousand heads of cattle and sheep each on the grasslands of Anda County, Heilongjiang Province. In the movement to increase production and practice economy, the farm studied Soviet experience and improved feeding management, which has greatly increased milk production, now reaching five tons per day. This is a scene of the staff of the first production team milking cows in the grassland.
