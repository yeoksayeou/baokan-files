    拉萨藏族人民欢度燃灯节
    十一月三十日（藏历十月二十五日）拉萨市藏族人民欢度燃灯节。拉萨市在这一天显得特别热闹。节日以前，四周农民和从羌塘牧区与青海、西康等地赶来的牧民，都到拉萨买卖皮毛、酥油、粮食和各种生活必需品。商店的橱柜里和摊贩们的货摊上，陈列着五光十色的货品。参加康藏公路拉萨至太昭段冬季施工的藏族民工们，也带着工资来拉萨购买节日用品。西藏军区干部学校的藏族教员和学员，拉萨小学的学生等，也在这一天休假。节日晚上，家家户户的房顶上和窗台上都点起明亮的酥油灯，把街道照耀得通明。市郊牧民们帐篷的周围，也闪烁着灯火。西藏军区干部学校的藏族学员们，还在林卡里举行了歌舞晚会。  （新华社）
