    Introducing a Method for Senior Cadres in the Northwest Region to Study the General Line
    Cadres across the country have universally launched into the study of the general line for the transition period, with great enthusiasm. It is expected that this study will greatly improve cadres' understanding of China's path forward and their socialist consciousness.
    The current task of Party committees at all levels in leading cadres' study is to ensure that this study is conducted earnestly, deeply, and achieves tangible results. Therefore, various effective methods should be adopted, such as lectures by leading comrades, organized reading and discussion, examinations and linking with work inspections, criticism of bourgeois ideology, and criticism of various erroneous ideas that violate the general line, to help the vast majority of cadres to do a good job of studying the general line. For cadres participating in senior study groups, in addition to requiring them to deeply understand the spirit and content of the general line, they should be particularly required to, based on the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism and guided by the general line for the transition period, combine this with specific inspections and research on policy issues in their work, draw concrete conclusions, and guide future work. Only in this way can the study of the general line have a real effect on improving our work. Moreover, only when senior-level cadres conduct this kind of serious study and research that combines theory with practice and policy, is it possible for them to significantly improve the study of middle-level groups or all cadres. And only then is it possible to truly solve the problem of integrating theory with practice in this study.
    Today, this newspaper introduces the specific methods used by cadres in the Northwest Region's first-level organizations to study the general line for the transition period, especially their method of assigning responsible cadres to conduct special research on various issues of the general line in connection with actual conditions. The method they have prescribed is precisely a concrete and effective step to improve and deepen the study of the general line. Implementing this method will help overcome the shortcomings of superficial learning, a lack of thorough understanding, and the disconnection of study from practical work; it will also help correct the lazy attitude of not using one's brain when studying theory and dealing with practical work. The Northwest Region's first-level organizations stipulate that this special research "must, under the guidance of Marxist-Leninist theory and the spirit of the general line, proceed from the actual situation in the Northwest Region, and write reports that have information, analysis, and conclusions; this kind of special research report should be different from a simple work inspection report, and should not be a general purely academic paper." These are all completely correct. Because only in this way can we overcome the two tendencies of only talking about theoretical principles or only talking about specific business in papers and study discussion meetings.
    Of course, this method of special research can only be implemented among cadres with a higher level of political theory, and should not be universally promoted to general cadres. However, senior-level cadres who are able to conduct this special research should make every effort to adopt this method for study. Experience has proven that the quality of senior-level cadres' theoretical study has a great impact on the quality of theoretical study of all cadres. And the principle of "closely integrating theory with practice," if it cannot be first implemented in the study of senior-level cadres, and relying on the results of senior-level cadres' serious study and research to guide and help everyone, will often become a general call, and it will be difficult to obtain concrete results. Therefore, the Northwest Region's first-level organizations' method of studying the general line for the transition period is worthy of reference or emulation by other regions.

    介绍西北区高级组干部学习总路线的一种方法
    全国各地干部已普遍地展开国家在过渡时期总路线的学习，学习的热情都很高涨，预计这一学习必将使干部对我国前进道路的认识和社会主义的觉悟大为提高。
    当前各地党委对干部学习领导的任务，就是要使这一学习能够认真进行，并能深入下去，获得确实的效果。因此，应该采取各种有效的办法，例如由领导同志讲课，组织阅读和讨论，举行考试和联系检查工作，批判资产阶级思想，批判各种违反总路线的错误思想，来帮助广大干部把总路线的学习搞好。而对于参加高级组学习的干部，除了应要求他们深入领会总路线的精神和内容外，特别应该要求他们能够根据马克思列宁主义的基本理论，并以国家在过渡时期的总路线为指针，结合具体检查并研究自己工作中的政策问题，作出具体的结论，指导今后的工作。只有这样，才能使总路线的学习发生确实能改进我们工作的作用。而且，也只有高级组的干部进行了这种认真的学习和联系实际和政策的研究，才有可能通过他们把中级组或全体干部的学习大大提高一步；也才有可能真正解决这一学习中理论和实际结合的问题。
    本报今天介绍了西北区一级机关干部学习国家在过渡时期总路线的具体办法，特别是他们指定负责干部对总路线的各项问题联系实际情况进行专题研究的办法。他们规定的这一办法，正是使总路线的学习提高和深入一步的具体的有效的步骤。实行这种办法，就会有助于克服那种泛泛而学、不求甚解、并使学习和实际工作脱节的缺点，就会有助于纠正在学习理论和对待实际工作时不用脑筋的懒汉作风。西北区一级机关规定这种专题研究，“必须在马克思列宁主义的理论和总路线精神的指导下，从西北区的实际情况出发，写出有情况、有分析、有结论的报告；这种专题研究报告应不同于单纯的业务检查报告，也不应是一般的纯粹学术性的论文”。这都是完全正确的。因为只有如此，才能克服那种在论文中和学习讨论会里只谈理论原则或者只谈具体业务的两种偏向。
    自然，这种专题研究的办法只能在政治理论水平较高的干部中实行，不应普遍推广于一般干部。但是，凡有条件进行这种专题研究的高级组干部，应尽量采用这一办法来进行学习。经验已经证明，高级组干部理论学习的好坏，对全体干部理论学习的好坏有很大的影响。而“理论与实际密切结合”的这一学习原则，如不能首先在高级组干部学习中贯彻，并依靠高级组干部的认真学习和研究的结果来指导与帮助大家，就往往会流为一般的号召，很难获得具体的结果。所以，西北区一级机关对国家在过渡时期总路线学习的这一办法，是值得各地参考或仿行的。
