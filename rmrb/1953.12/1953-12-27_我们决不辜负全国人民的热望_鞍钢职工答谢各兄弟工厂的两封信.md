    We Will Never Fail the Ardent Expectations of the People of the Whole Country
    Two Letters from Anshan Iron and Steel Workers Thanking Brother Factories
    To all comrades of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory:
    We have read your letter with immense gratitude. Thanks to the enthusiastic support of the working class and the people of the whole country, and the selfless and active assistance of Soviet experts, the steel capital has completed the seamless steel tube plant ahead of schedule, following the completion of the automated No. 8 blast furnace. In addition, the large rolling mill and No. 7 blast furnace were all completed before the end of the year.
    We are very happy to accept your opinions. You have made great efforts to modify the light oil vehicles. We are already very satisfied to be able to ride in passenger cars with painted leather seats under the existing conditions.
    The motherland has launched large-scale economic construction, and the steel capital is the focus of the motherland's large-scale construction. We will never fail the ardent expectations of the people of the whole country. We can only respond to your support with practical actions. Let us work together with the people of the whole country in the motherland's large-scale economic construction to build the steel capital more beautifully and the motherland more prosperous, and strive to gradually transition to a better socialist society!
    With best regards,
                    Anshan Iron and Steel Company All Employees
    Learning from Soviet Experience, Improving Technical Level
    Dear Comrades of the Shenyang Low-Voltage Switch Factory:
    Just as we were enthusiastically celebrating the successful trial rolling of China's first automated seamless steel tube plant, we received your letter, which further encouraged our confidence in the success of the trial rolling.
    The completion of this most technically demanding automated factory in fifteen months is the result of the leadership of the Party, the assistance of the great Soviet government and the Soviet people, the strong support of the people of the whole country, and the efforts of all the workers in the construction of the factory. This is a victory for our Party, a victory for the first year of China's first Five-Year Plan, and a victory for the unbreakable friendship between China and the Soviet Union!
    Comrades, the fact that the seamless steel tube plant has been built proves that the Chinese people, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, can not only build, but also fully master production. Eight or nine months ago, many comrades in our factory were still engaged in agricultural production, and they knew a little about tending crops; when it came to factories and machines, especially brand-new automated machines, they had neither seen nor heard of them. But they finally came to the factory and had to operate these automated machines. In order to overcome difficulties, everyone enthusiastically engaged in technical study. Many comrades had a low level of education and even found it difficult to take notes. We also launched a mutual assistance and mutual learning movement to overcome the difficulties in learning.
    Comrades, from your letter, we learned that you have made great efforts to support the construction of the seamless steel tube plant. You have overcome difficulties and completed the arduous task of one hundred and twenty-nine kinds of automated electrical control equipment. You also organized various professional groups, overcame the difficulties of lack of raw materials and few drawings, and completed the task that normally takes four months in fifteen days. Therefore, let us express our sincere thanks to you!
    From November 16th, our factory officially implemented a two-shift trial production system every day. Everyone unanimously stated: We will ensure the implementation of the instructions from higher authorities, continuously improve technical levels and train the third shift of production personnel, and strive to start full three-shift production every day as soon as possible. Comrades, we also express to you: We must conscientiously learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, resolutely implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, and engage in production better. Let us work together and advance towards the realization of the country's socialist industrialization!
    With best regards,
                  Anshan Seamless Steel Tube Plant All Employees

    我们决不辜负全国人民的热望
    鞍钢职工答谢各兄弟工厂的两封信
    把钢都建设得更美丽长辛店机车车辆修理工厂全体同志：
    我们以万分感激的心情读完了你们的来信。钢都在全国工人阶级及全国人民热烈的支援下，在苏联专家大公无私的积极帮助下，继自动化八号炼铁炉建成之后，又提前建完无缝钢管厂。另外，大型轧钢厂、七号炼铁炉已于年前全部完工。
    我们非常欣悦地接受你们的意见，你们对轻油车改修，已经作了极大的努力。我们能够在现有的条件下，乘坐漆皮垫座位的客车，已经很满意了。
    祖国已开展了大规模的经济建设，钢都又是祖国大规模建设的重点，我们决不辜负全国人民的热望，我们只有用实际的行动来回答你们对我们的支援。让我们在祖国大规模经济建设中和全国人民一道，把钢都建设得更美丽，把祖国建设得更繁荣，为逐步过渡到美好的社会主义社会而努力！此致敬礼
                    鞍山钢铁公司全体职工
    学习苏联经验，提高技术水平亲爱的沈阳低压开关厂全体职工同志们：
    正当我们热烈欢庆我国第一座自动化无缝钢管厂试轧胜利的时候，接到你们的来信，更加鼓舞了我们试轧成功的信心。
    这个在技术要求上最复杂的自动化工厂所以能用十五个月建设完工，这是党的领导、伟大的苏联政府和苏联人民的帮助、全国人民的大力支援和建厂全体职工的努力的结果。这是我们党的胜利，是我国第一个五年建设计划第一年的胜利，是中苏两国牢不可破的友谊的胜利！
    同志们，无缝钢管厂建成的事实证明了：我国人民在党和毛主席的英明领导下，不仅能够建设，而且也完全能够掌握生产。八、九个月以前，我厂不少同志还在农村生产，要讲侍弄庄稼还多少懂一些；讲到工厂和机器，特别是全新的自动化机器，不但没有看见过，也没有听到过。但是他们终于来到了工厂，而且要操纵这些自动化机器。为了克服困难，大家热烈地进行技术学习。不少同志文化程度低，连记笔记都感到困难。我们又开展了互助互学运动，克服了学习中的困难。
    同志们，从来信中，使我们知道了你们为支援无缝钢管厂的建厂作了重大的努力。你们克服了困难，完成了一百二十九种自动化电气控制设备的艰巨任务。你们又组织了各种专业小组，克服了缺原料、少图纸的困难，用十五天的时间完成了平时需用四个月时间才能完成的任务。因此，让我们向你们表示真诚的感谢！
    由十一月十六日起，我厂正式实行了每天两班制的试轧性生产。大家一致表示：保证实现上级的指示，不断地提高技术水平与培养第三班生产人员，争取早日开始全厂每天三班制的生产。同志们，我们也向你们表示：要认真学习苏联先进经验，坚决贯彻苏联专家建议，更好地从事生产。让我们共同努力，为实现国家的社会主义工业化而前进！此致
  敬礼
                  鞍钢无缝钢管厂全体职工
