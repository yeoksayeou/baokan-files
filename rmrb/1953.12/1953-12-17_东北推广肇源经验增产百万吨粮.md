    Northeast Promotes Zhaoyuan Experience, Increasing Grain Production by One Million Tons
    This year, various parts of Northeast China actively promoted the Zhaoyuan (formerly Guo'erluosi Later Banner) rich harvest experience of Heilongjiang Province (hereinafter referred to as the Zhaoyuan rich harvest experience) and achieved significant success. According to preliminary estimates, the entire region increased grain production by approximately one million tons this year due to the promotion of this experience. Therefore, although agricultural production in Northeast China suffered relatively serious natural disasters this year, the total grain output still exceeded the actual output of 1950 (a bumper harvest year) and 1951 (when the disaster was lighter than this year). This is a major victory for the Zhaoyuan rich harvest experience in increasing grain production.
    The Zhaoyuan rich harvest experience is a technical reform experience of universal significance summarized on the basis of the relatively extensive and old farming methods in Northeast China. It grasps the key to increasing production: fully utilizing soil fertility and rational close planting. Over the past year, under the policy of "extensive publicity, key promotion," various localities vigorously promoted this experience, resulting in significant improvements in crop cultivation techniques. All localities have begun to pay attention to changing the current sparse planting situation of crops, appropriately increasing the number of plants per unit area, and largely overcoming the phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken rows. The general crops have increased by more than 10% compared with previous years. According to a survey of demonstration farms in fifty-seven counties in Northeast China and the surrounding farmland, the number of plants per unit area for several major crops this year is: wheat averages 3.58 million plants per hectare, an increase of approximately 1.5 million plants compared to last year; soybeans average 219,000 plants per hectare, an increase of approximately 60,000 plants compared to last year; millet averages 514,000 plants per hectare, an increase of approximately 100,000 plants compared to last year; sorghum averages more than 58,000 plants per hectare, an increase of more than 10,000 plants compared to last year; cotton averages more than 66,000 plants per hectare, an increase of approximately 10,000 plants compared to last year. The appropriate increase in the number of plants per unit area effectively utilized the land, thus guaranteeing the increase in grain production, and the entire region is estimated to increase grain production by approximately one million tons as a result. At the same time, all localities focused on cultivating approximately 1.5 million hectares of high-yield land, produced more grain, and set an example for increasing agricultural production.
    On the other hand, the vast majority of rural work cadres, after studying the Zhaoyuan rich harvest experience, the three documents including the "Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Agricultural Production Mutual Aid and Cooperation," and Comrade Ren Guodong, Secretary of the CPC Guo'erluosi Later Banner Committee's working methods of following the mass line, have also undergone great changes in their working methods and established a working style of going deep into the fields and into the masses. In the process of leading agricultural production this year, Liaoxi Province achieved the leadership experience of "summarizing typical examples, setting examples, organizing observations, and promoting the general"; Guo'erluosi Later Banner in Heilongjiang adopted the leadership method of "one point for multiple aspects, on-site demonstrations, continuous visits, and circular trips to the countryside"; and other localities generally used the working method of going deep into the production process and focusing on leadership to promote overall development. Many county and district cadres, during the busy season of production,展开“field training” and “ditch education” by helping the masses in production. In their actual work this year, they deeply experienced the great effect of "saying a thousand words is not as good as showing an example." Some village cadres in the past did not have much enthusiasm for agricultural production work, but in this year's promotion of the Zhaoyuan experience, they realized that there are indeed many tricks to producing more grain, so they began to seriously study technology and were determined to lead the masses to do a good job in production.
    The implementation of the Zhaoyuan experience must have a corresponding labor organization, so the promotion of the Zhaoyuan experience has also powerfully promoted the development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement. The general reaction of farmers in various places is: "This year, if you accept the Zhaoyuan experience and don't do a good job in mutual aid and cooperation, then there's no way!" Mutual aid and cooperative organizations in various localities have improved labor efficiency and further improved farming techniques in the process of promoting the Zhaoyuan experience.
    With the promotion of the Zhaoyuan rich harvest experience, a widespread movement of mutual teaching and learning of technology has been launched among the broad masses of farmers this year. It is estimated that approximately three to five million farmers throughout the region have received relatively in-depth technical education. In this unprecedented large-scale movement of mutual teaching and learning of technology, farmers in various localities began to overcome the conservative ideas of "production has reached its peak" and "it is difficult to produce ten thousand shi of grain without planting a thousand hectares of land," and established the confidence that they can increase production by organizing and improving technology.

    东北推广肇源经验增产百万吨粮
    今年，东北各地积极推广黑龙江省郭尔罗斯后旗（肇源）丰产经验（以下称肇源丰产经验），获得了显著的成就。据初步估计，全区今年因推广这一经验约增产粮食一百万吨。因此，今年东北农业生产虽然受到比较严重的自然灾害，但粮食总产量仍然超过一九五○年（丰收年）和一九五一年（那年比今年灾害轻）的实际产量。这是肇源丰产经验在提高粮食产量方面的重大胜利。
    肇源丰产经验，是在东北地区耕作比较粗放的、旧的耕作方法的基础上，总结出的具有普遍意义的一项技术改革经验。它抓住了充分利用地力、合理密植这一增产的关键。一年来各地在“普遍宣传，重点推广”的方针下，大力推广这一经验，使农作物栽培技术有了显著的改进。各地都开始注意改变目前作物栽培的稀植状况，适当增加了作物单位面积株数，在很大程度上克服了缺苗断条现象，一般的作物都比往年增加了一成苗以上。据东北五十七个县示范农场在其周围农田的调查，今年几种主要作物单位面积的株数是：小麦每垧平均三百五十八万株，比去年约增加一百五十万株；大豆每垧平均二十一万九千株，比去年约增加六万株；谷子每垧平均五十一万四千株，约比去年增加十万株；高粱每垧平均五万八千多株，比去年增加一万多株；棉花每垧平均六万六千多株，比去年约增加一万株左右。作物单位面积株数的适当增多，有效地利用了土地，就保证了粮食产量的增加，全区估计可由此而增产粮食一百万吨左右。同时各地并重点培育了约一百五十万垧丰产地，多打了粮食，为农业增产做出了榜样。
    另一方面，广大农村工作干部学习了肇源丰产经验，学习了中共中央关于农业生产互助合作的决议等三个文件，学习中共郭尔罗斯后旗旗委书记任国栋同志走群众路线的工作方法以后，在工作方法方面也有很大转变，树立起深入田间深入群众的工作作风。在今年领导农业生产过程中，辽西省取得了“总结典型，树立样子，组织观摩，推动一般”的领导经验；黑龙江郭尔罗斯后旗采取了“一点多面，实地表演，连环参观，循环下乡”的领导方法；其他各地一般都运用了深入生产过程、重点领导推动全面的工作方法。许多县区干部在生产紧张季节，通过帮助群众生产，展开“田间训练”，“垄沟教育”。他们在今年实际工作中，深刻体验到
  “说千道万，不如做出样子看”的巨大作用。有些村干部过去对农业生产工作劲头不大，但在今年推广肇源经验中，他们认识到了多打粮食的窍门实在多得很，因而开始认真钻研技术，决心领导群众把生产搞好。
    实行肇源经验必须有与之相适应的劳动组织，因而肇源经验的推广也有力地推动了农村互助合作运动的发展。各地农民一般的反映是：“今年接受肇源经验，不搞好互助合作，那算没门啊！”各地互助合作组织在推行肇源经验中提高了劳动效率，进一步改进了耕作技术。
    随着推广肇源丰产经验，今年广大农民群众中广泛地展开了互教互学技术的运动。据估计全区约有三百万至五百万农民受到了较为深刻的技术教育。在这一空前的规模浩大的互教互学技术的运动中，各地农民开始克服了“增产到顶”与“不种千垧地，难打万石粮”的保守思想，树立起组织起来，改进技术，就可增产的信心。
