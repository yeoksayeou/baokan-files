    Pyongyang—Beijing
    Gao Fen, Jin Feng
    I. The News of the Communiqué Arrives
    “Mom, this is so appreciated! Chairman Mao sent his most outstanding sons and daughters to help us during the war, and now he’s giving us so much assistance. He truly treats the Korean people's affairs as his own!” The young military spouse Park Ok-hee and her mother-in-law had just finished their work application procedures at the factory. Passing by the bulletin board, they saw the special edition of the Sino-Korean Joint Communiqué, filled with immense joy. She spoke to her mother while walking home with light steps.
    The news of the communiqué spread like a spring breeze throughout Pyongyang, growing from the ruins. Whether in the streets, factories, schools, or underground bunkers, everyone was sharing this joyful news. Instantly, everyone seemed to gain limitless strength. The intense construction proceeded even more rapidly. Workers at the Pyongyang Textile Factory started full production ten days ahead of schedule, and railway workers guaranteed to exceed the 1953 plan. Farmers in Miyam-ri, in the suburbs, were strengthening preparations for increased agricultural production next year. Teachers at the Pyongyang No. 3 Girls' Middle School wanted to educate children with even greater effort. The children told each other: “Work harder at studying! If you study well, you can go to China!”
    II. Traditional Friendship
    Pyongyang and Beijing are so interconnected and share weal and woe. Everywhere in Pyongyang, one can see traces of the traditional friendship between the Chinese and Korean people.
    Looking at the Daedong Gate, with its architectural style resembling the Qianmen city gate, and the Eulmil Pavilion on Moran Hill, people naturally think of the past. More than three hundred years ago, the Korean people once saw the beacon fires lit by Japanese invaders from Eulmil Pavilion and also saw ancient China's reinforcements entering through Daedong Gate. Today, a new road has been opened right next to the foot of Moran Hill. Poet Heo Jin-gyu sings:
    This street,
    Is like extending a hand of friendship,
    Reaching out to the distant north;
    This street,
    Is respected by people, called:
      “Mao Zedong Street”!
    Chinese comrades
    Were like lightning,
    Taking this street
    And entering Pyongyang.
    The traditional friendship has developed. Like Beijing, the ancient city of Pyongyang, built a thousand years ago, is rising from the ruins. The heroic city of Pyongyang, in the past with her battles, today with her recovery and construction, attracts the attention and respect of people all over the world, extending hands of friendship from all sides.
    Not long ago, more than 770 technical workers volunteered to come from China to assist in the construction of Korea. Facing a scene of ruins in Pyongyang, they said as if vowing: “The suffering of the Korean people is our suffering. We must build Pyongyang to be like Beijing.”
    III. Volunteer Army Engineers Building Pyongyang
    "We will build the heroic Pyongyang as if we were building Beijing." The soldiers of a certain engineering unit of the Volunteer Army, who immediately went to Pyongyang after the armistice to assist in construction, also said this. Before the armistice, they had just participated in the counterattack south of Kimhwa. Rain poured, bombs exploded, comrades sacrificed, and were wounded. Blood dripped on the Korean land as they repaired the road from Kimhwa to Kimhwa, and built the Chongchon River Bridge and the Imjin River Bridge. Today, they have come to the Daedong River to build the Daedong River Bridge.
    In less than two months, more than 200 soldiers built a 518-meter-long pontoon bridge across the Daedong River. Soldier Tan Faxin carried stones to lay the bridge foundation, with more than 30 injuries from the stones, and was covered in water from head to toe, but did not feel bitter. Wang Mingli's ironworking team, who made tools, rushed to forge iron day and night. His hands were so swollen that he couldn't even hold the hammer handle, but he didn't feel tired. Peng Shuqing, who sawed wood for three consecutive night shifts, could no longer lift his hand. He was unknowingly dozing off, but when he heard the platoon leader reading the People's Daily, which mentioned that "for a more beautiful Pyongyang," their engineering unit was participating in the construction of Pyongyang, he was overjoyed and exclaimed excitedly: "Chairman Mao saw the newspaper and knows that we are building Pyongyang. He will also be happy!"
    "Our construction of Pyongyang is to add a bit more security to Beijing." The instructor's words continued to inspire them. The bridge was completed twenty days ahead of schedule. Comrade He Long, head of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, crossed the bridge on the first train.
    IV. Interconnected, Closely Linked
    Pyongyang and Beijing are so interconnected and closely linked. In Pyongyang, one can encounter the hands of friendship extended from a close neighbor everywhere, and one can feel the breath of New China everywhere.
    The cement of the construction factory is stamped with the mark of Qixin Cement Factory, the glass of Yaohua Glass Factory shines in the Pyongyang sunlight, and the wood of the newly built pontoon bridge over the Daedong River exudes the aura of the Changbai Mountains and the Heilongjiang River. Heroic Korean drivers drive locomotives from China, transporting construction materials from Sinuiju, Wonsan, Chongjin… day and night to support the construction of the Republic's heart. Technicians who have returned from internships at Anshan Iron and Steel and Shanghai Cotton Textile Factory are applying the production technology experience brought back from China in front of Pyongyang's steel furnaces and textile machines. The Hao Jianxiu Work Method is being widely promoted in the Pyongyang Textile Factory. Model female worker Kim Bok-sil learned the Hao Jianxiu Work Method and completed the 1953 plan 102 days ahead of schedule.
    The Korean people love Chinese works of art. Under the extremely difficult conditions during the war, Chinese films "The White-Haired Girl" and "Steel Warrior" were shown here and were warmly welcomed. Ding Ling's "The Sun Shines Over the Sangkan River," Wei Wei's "Who Are the Most Beloved People," etc., were introduced to Korea under very difficult printing conditions.
    The people of Pyongyang yearn for Beijing. The National Art Theater is staging the opera "Beautiful Friendship," with the friendship between the Volunteer Army and the Korean people as its theme; the National Theater is staging "Facing New Things" in conjunction with the current construction of the Republic; Pyongyang Textile Factory's labor model Kim Bok-sil's letter to Hao Jianxiu is full of gratitude and love for the Chinese people and workers; the students of the First Girls' High School are rushing to make embroidered handkerchiefs and pillows, preparing to entrust the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea to bring them to the students of the First Girls' Middle School in Beijing as souvenirs. The children of the Third Girls' Middle School composed beautiful songs dedicated to Chairman Mao. The poets used the pens given by the delegation and wrote poems praising Mao Zedong for the first time. Pyongyang Film Studio is rushing to produce a documentary reflecting the heroic struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteers over the past three years as a gift to Chairman Mao. The first volume of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong in Korean is being rushed to print on the printing presses. The first volume, upper and lower parts, was issued 70,000 copies, and the upper part of the second volume was printed another 50,000 copies.
    The heroic people building Pyongyang are advancing day and night in the struggle against the ruins and the severe cold. They look to Beijing and sing with confidence:
    Chairman Mao Zedong,
    Although you live in distant Beijing,
    But we firmly believe that you will clearly hear
    The songs of construction we are singing.
    Pyongyang—Beijing, are advancing side by side! (Attached picture)

    平壤—北京
    高汾、金凤
    一、公报的消息传来
    “妈妈，这是多么值得感激的事啊！毛主席在战时派了自己最优秀的儿女来帮助咱，今天又给咱们这么大的援助，真是把朝鲜人民的事情看作是他们自己的事情啦！”年轻的军属朴玉姬和她的婆婆刚从工厂办好上工的手续回来，走过布告牌，看到了刚刚出来的中朝两国谈判公报的号外，怀着无限喜悦的心情，她一边跟她妈妈说着，一边带着轻快的步伐走回家去。
    公报的消息像春风一样吹遍了从废墟中生长着的平壤，无论街头、厂房、学校、地洞里到处都在传播着这个喜讯。立刻，每个人仿佛觉得增加了无限的力量。紧张的建设进行得更迅速了。平壤纺织厂的工人们提前了十天全面开工，铁道工人保证超额完成一九五三年计划。郊区美岩里的农民在加强明年农业增产的准备，平壤市第三女子中学的教师们要以更大的努力来教育孩子。孩子们互相叮咛说：“加一把劲学习呀！学好了可以去中国！”
    二、传统的友谊
    平壤和北京是这样息息相通，休戚相关。在平壤处处可以看到朝中人民传统的友谊的痕迹。
    望着建筑形式仿佛像前门城楼一样的大同门和牡丹峰上的乙密台，使人们自然地想到了过去。三百多年以前，朝鲜人民曾经在乙密台上望到了日本侵略者燃起的烽火，同时也看到了古代中国的援兵就从大同门开了进来。而今天，紧挨着牡丹峰下新开辟了一条路，诗人许进溪这样歌唱着：
    就是这条街，
    像伸出一只友谊的手，
    伸向遥远的北方；
    就是这条街，
    被人们尊敬着，称呼着：
      “毛泽东街”！
    中国战友们
    曾经像闪电一样，
    打这条街
    开进了平壤。
    传统的友谊发展了。和北京一样，一千年前就已建筑起来的古城——平壤正从废墟中站起来。英雄城平壤过去以她的战斗，今天以她的恢复和建设吸引着全世界人民的注视和尊敬，从各方面伸出友谊的手。
    不久前从中国来了七百七十多名志愿援助朝鲜建设的技术工人。对着一片废墟的平壤，他们宣誓似地说：“朝鲜人民的苦难就是我们的苦难，我们一定要把平壤建设得和北京一样。”
    三、建设平壤的志愿军工兵们
    “我们建设英雄的平壤，就如建设北京一样。”停战后马上开到平壤协助建设的志愿军某工兵部队的战士也都这样说。停战前他们刚参加了金城以南反击战。大雨浇着，炸弹炸着，同志牺牲了，炸伤了，血滴在朝鲜的土地上，他们修着从金化通到金城的公路，架起清川江桥，架起临津江桥。今天，他们又来到大同江上来架起大同江桥。
    不到两个月的时间，两百多战士修起全长五一八公尺的大同江便桥。战士谭发信抬石头奠桥基，身上三十多处被石头碰伤，头上到脚上都是水，不觉得苦。打工具的王明理铁工组日夜赶打铁，手肿得连锤把也拿不住，不觉得累。赶了三个夜工锯木头的彭树清，他的手已经抬不起来了，他不知不觉要打瞌睡，一听到班长读人民日报读到“为了平壤更美丽”是讲他们工兵部队参加修建平壤的事，心里乐开了，兴奋地嚷着：“毛主席看到报纸，知道咱们在修建平壤，他老人家也会高兴啦。”
    “咱们建设平壤就是给北京多添一分保障。”指导员的话又在鼓舞着他们。大桥提前二十天完工。中国人民赴朝慰问团贺龙总团长坐着第一趟车过桥。
    四、息息相通，脉脉相连
    平壤和北京，是这样息息相通，脉脉相连。在平壤，处处可以接触到从亲密邻邦伸过来的友谊的手，处处可以感觉到新中国的呼吸。
    建筑工厂的水泥盖着启新水泥厂的戳记，耀华玻璃厂的玻璃在平壤的日光下闪耀，大同江新修便桥的木材散发着白山黑水的气息。英雄的朝鲜司机驾驶着来自中国的机车，从新义州、元山、清津……日夜不断地运输着建筑器材来支援共和国心脏的建设。从鞍钢，从上海棉纺织厂实习回来的技师们，正在平壤的炼钢炉前和纺织机前应用着从中国带回的生产技术经验。郝建秀工作法正在平壤纺织厂普遍推广。模范女工金福实学习了郝建秀工作法，提前一百零两天完成一九五三年的计划。
    朝鲜人民热爱着中国的艺术作品，在战时十二分艰难的条件下，中国影片“白毛女”、“钢铁战士”在这里上演受到热烈的欢迎。丁玲的“太阳照在桑干河上”、魏巍的“谁是最可爱的人”等都在十分困难的印刷条件下被介绍到了朝鲜。
    平壤的人民向往着北京。国立艺术剧场正在上演以志愿军与朝鲜人民血肉相连的友谊为题材的歌剧“美丽的友谊”；国立剧场结合共和国当前的建设上演“在新事物面前”；平壤纺织厂的劳动模范金福实在给郝建秀的信中，充满了对于中国人民和工人的感激和热爱；第一女子高级中学的学生们正在赶制着绣花手帕、枕头，准备托中国人民赴朝慰问团带给北京的第一女子中学的同学作纪念。第三女子中学的孩子们编了优美的歌曲献给毛主席，诗人们用着慰问团赠送的笔，第一次写的是歌颂毛泽东的诗篇。平壤电影制片厂正在日夜赶制着反映三年来中国人民志愿军英勇斗争的纪录片作为给毛主席的献礼。在印刷机上正赶印着朝鲜文的毛泽东选集第二卷上集。第一卷上下集发行了七万册，第二卷上集又印了五万册。
    建设平壤的英雄的人民，他们日日夜夜在与废墟，与严寒的搏斗中前进。他们遥望着北京，满怀信心歌唱着：
    毛泽东主席啊，
    你虽住在遥远的北京，
    但我们深信你会清楚地听到
    我们正在唱着的建设的歌声。
    平壤—北京，正在并肩前进！（附图片）
