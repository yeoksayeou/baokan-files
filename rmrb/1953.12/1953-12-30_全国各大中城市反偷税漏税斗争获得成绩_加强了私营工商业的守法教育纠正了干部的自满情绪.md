    The struggle against tax evasion in major and medium-sized cities across the country has achieved initial results. As of now, except for Shanghai and Tianjin, where the effort has largely concluded, other regions are either nearing completion or continuing to deepen their campaigns. According to incomplete statistics from various locations: In Shanghai, over 100,600 households self-reported and supplemented nearly 70 billion yuan in evaded taxes. In Tianjin, over 36,000 households self-reported or were found to have underreported business volume by over 1 trillion yuan and income by over 61 billion yuan. In Wuhan, as of mid-October, a total of 919 households were inspected, revealing an underreporting of business volume exceeding 120 billion yuan. In Shenyang, by the end of October, the total amount of tax evasion discovered was over 4.184 billion yuan. In Hangzhou, by the end of October, 1,210 cases of tax evasion were uncovered, with taxes owed amounting to 6.1 billion yuan. In Zhengzhou, tax evasion totaling 4.8 billion yuan has been uncovered.

    The broad masses of workers and shop assistants played an active role in protecting tax revenue during the anti-tax evasion struggle. Under the mobilization and leadership of local trade unions, workers and shop assistants in various regions actively urged capitalists to conduct serious self-examinations and supplements, and reported the tax evasion behaviors of illegal capitalists. In the Wuchang district of Wuhan, the capitalists of nine rice and flour shops supplemented 400 million yuan in business volume with the help and urging of workers and shop assistants. When the tax bureau's audit team arrived at a stationery store in the Jianghan district of the city, the shop assistants actively introduced the situation and provided materials to the audit team, thus uncovering that the store had underreported 25 billion yuan in business volume. The mobilization of workers and shop assistants in Kunming was relatively good. For example, import and export business shop assistants reported 102 pieces of tax evasion material and 21.6 billion yuan in business volume within three days.

    When private industrial and commercial operators began their self-examinations and supplements, some adopted a perfunctory attitude, attempting to muddle through. Some who had engaged in serious tax evasion claimed, "'After the 'Five-Anti' movement, there will be no more tax evasion.'" Others adopted a wait-and-see approach to tax evasion, "reporting as little as possible" or "not reporting if possible," or only supplementing what was brought up by workers and shop assistants. Some reported small items but not large ones, using trivial matters to get by. Some illegal private merchants even co-opted, attacked, and threatened workers and shop assistants. In response to these situations, local governments, trade unions, industrial and commercial federations, and other organizations repeatedly conducted propaganda mobilization and patriotic legal education for private industrial and commercial operators during the self-examination and supplement process to reverse their erroneous understanding of self-examination and supplement, and to inspire them to conduct self-examination and supplement. The People's Government generally granted lenient treatment to most industrial and commercial households who had engaged in tax evasion in the past but were relatively honest and serious in their self-examinations and supplements; those who engaged in serious tax evasion but did not conduct serious self-examinations and supplements were appropriately punished separately; and individuals with serious and egregious circumstances were arrested and prosecuted by local People's Courts based on the facts of their violations.

    Through the anti-tax evasion struggle and the self-examinations and supplements of industrial and commercial operators, not only was the patriotic legal education of private industrial and commercial businesses strengthened, and national tax revenue was maintained, but also all tax workers were educated, enabling them to more clearly recognize the seriousness of tax evasion after the "Five-Anti" movement, correct the complacency that existed among some cadres in the past, and further recognize the consistency of implementing policies and completing tasks, thereby increasing their confidence in completing tasks. At the same time, work experience was continuously created and enriched during the struggle, laying the foundation for carrying out regular anti-tax evasion struggles in the future.

    全国各大中城市反偷税漏税斗争获得成绩
    加强了私营工商业的守法教育纠正了干部的自满情绪
    全国各大、中城市的反对偷税漏税斗争已初步获得成绩。截至目前止，除上海、天津两市已告一段落外，其他各地有的即将结束，有的正在继续深入开展中。根据各地不完全的统计：上海市自查补报中有十万零六千余户补报了偷漏各税近七百亿元。天津市有三万六千余户补报和被检查出来的少报营业额一万余亿元，所得额六百一十多亿元。武汉市截至十月半止，共检查了九百一十九户，查出少报营业额一千二百余亿元。沈阳市截至十月底，查获偷漏税款共四十一亿八千四百余万元。杭州市截至十月底查获偷漏税案一千二百一十件，应补税款六十一亿元。郑州市已检查出偷漏税款四十八亿元。
    广大工人店员在反对偷税漏税斗争中，起了积极的护税作用。各地工人店员在当地工会的发动和领导下，纷纷督促资本家认真自查补报，并检举了不法资本家的偷税漏税行为。武汉市武昌区有九家米面店的资方在工人店员的帮助和督促下补报了四亿元的营业额。该市江汉区某文具店的店员，当税务局查账小组到达该号时，便积极向查账小组介绍情况，提供材料，因此查出该号少报营业额二十五亿元。昆明市工人、店员发动得比较好，如进出口业店员在三天内即检举出偷漏材料一百零二件、营业额达二百一十六亿元。
    各地私营工商业者在开始自查补报时，有些对自查补报抱着应付态度，企图混过关去。有的偷税漏税很严重，但却说：“‘五反’运动后，不会再偷税漏税了。”有的对偷税漏税采取看风使舵的办法，“能少报，就少报”，“能不报，就不报”，或是被工人店员提出来的就补报，不提的不报。有的报小不报大，报些鸡毛蒜皮的小项目来搪塞。还有些不法私商竟对工人、店员进行拉拢、打击和威胁。根据这些情况，各地在进行自查补报时，均由当地政府、工会、工商业联合会等，向私营工商业者进行了反复的宣传动员和爱国守法教育，以扭转他们对自查补报的错误认识，并启发他们进行自查补报。人民政府对过去有偷税、漏税而在自查补报中态度比较老实、认真进行自查补报的大部工商业户，一般都予以宽大处理；对某些偷税漏税严重，而又不认真进行自查补报的工商业户，即分别予以适当处罚；对个别情节严重而恶劣的，则由各地人民法院根据违法事实，逮捕法办。
    经过反偷税漏税斗争和工商业者的自查补报后，不仅加强了私营工商业的爱国守法教育，维护了国家税收，也教育了全体税务工作人员，使他们更清楚地认识了“五反”运动后偷税漏税的严重性，纠正了过去有些干部存在的麻痹自满情绪，进一步认识到贯彻政策和完成任务的一致性，提高了完成任务的信心。同时在斗争中更不断地创造和丰富了工作经验，给今后开展经常性的反对偷税漏税斗争打下了基础。
