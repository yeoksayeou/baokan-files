    “Expanding the Family Fortune”
    Yan Ling
    There is a principle in socialism: the means of production are publicly owned, while the means of subsistence are privately owned.
    Some peasants, understanding this, have started making their own calculations: it’s better to acquire more means of subsistence, while making do with the existing means of production and not buying new ones. Some cadres, in order to boost the peasants' “enthusiasm for production,” also help them make these calculations, encouraging them to “expand their family fortune” in terms of the means of subsistence. As a result, some peasants are using all their increased grain production solely for means of subsistence. It is, of course, right for peasants to want to improve their lives. But the question is how to truly improve living standards and continuously improve them. If one follows the “small calculation” mentioned above to “expand the family fortune,” it will be impossible to expand it in the long run.
    Where do the means of subsistence come from? They are all produced. If we don't first economize on the means of subsistence, don't expand investment in production, and don't produce more grain to sell to the state, how can the state's industry develop and provide more and cheaper means of subsistence? Furthermore, if the peasants do not work hard to increase production, what will they use to exchange for more means of subsistence?
    What are the means of subsistence like in a completely socialist society? The peasant representatives who have visited the Soviet Union have already told everyone; roughly speaking: there are multi-story buildings in the cities, and there are also multi-story buildings in the countryside; there are electric lights in the cities, and there are also electric lights in the countryside; the homes of collective farm members have carpets and running water; they eat bread, biscuits, various meats, and fruits every day; both male and female farm members have very beautiful silk and woolen clothing; large farms have cinemas, dance halls, hospitals, and bathhouses; transportation includes cars, trucks, and horse-drawn carriages. Many of these things are privately owned, and some are collectively owned. Things like cinemas and hospitals cannot be run by individuals, nor do they need to be. Many of our peasants are now building houses. Taking house building as an example, no matter how new and elaborate our rural houses are now, they are still not as good as the houses of Soviet peasants, are they? As for cloth, even in China, patterns will become outdated after five years, and new cloths will be more beautiful and cheaper. If someone accumulates these means of subsistence now, they will laugh at themselves when socialism is fully realized.
    What are the agricultural means of production like when socialism is fully realized? "Gathering" the plows, harrows, and ropes that everyone uses now will not establish a collective farm like those in the Soviet Union. In the Soviet Union, the agricultural means of production, such as tractors and many other agricultural machines, are owned by state-owned tractor stations; some machines and smaller hydroelectric power stations are owned by the farms; peasants also have their own small plots of land, need to prune fruit trees, and hoe the land, etc., so peasants also have some small means of production of their own. Some of our peasants are afraid that all means of production will be collectivized in socialism. In fact, what good is it to collectivize hoes, sickles, ropes, etc.? The current agricultural producers' cooperatives also have some publicly owned means of production. However, that is not "confiscated" without compensation; it is either voluntarily contributed by members at a discounted price or purchased with public accumulation funds. Public ownership of the means of production in socialism is by no means confiscating everyone's plows, harrows, ropes, and the like. Peasants can rest assured and add more means of production; only by adding more means of production, participating in mutual aid and cooperation, and working hard to increase production, is the fundamental way to "expand the family fortune."

### “扩大家业”

    “扩大家业”
    燕凌
    社会主义里头有一条：生产资料是公有的，生活资料是个人所有的。
    有些农民知道了这一点，就打起自己的小算盘来了：生活资料还是多多置办一些好；生产资料将就着用，不要再买新的了。有些干部为了提高农民的“生产积极性”，也帮助他们打这种小算盘，要他们在生活资料方面“扩大家业”。结果是使一部分农民把增产的粮食完全用在生活资料上了。农民要改善生活，那当然是对的。但问题在于怎样才能真正改善生活、不断改善生活。如果按照上面说的“小算盘”来“扩大家业”，那是一辈子也扩大不了的。
    生活资料从那里来？还不都是生产出来的。不先在生活资料方面节约，不扩大生产投资，不增产更多粮食卖给国家，国家工业不发达，那来更多更便宜的生活资料？再说，如果农民不努力增产，又拿什么来换更多的生活资料？
    到了社会主义社会，人们的生活资料是什么样子呢？去苏联参观过的农民代表们已经告诉大家了，大概地说就是：城里有楼房，乡里也有楼房；城里有电灯，乡里也有电灯；集体农庄庄员们的家里，有毯子，有自来水；他们每天吃的是面包、饼干、各种肉和水果；男女庄员都有很漂亮的绸缎呢绒料子的衣裳；大的农庄都有电影院、跳舞厅、医院、澡塘；走路有大小汽车和马车。这些东西里头，有许多是个人所有的，也有一些是集体所有的。像电影院、医院等等，个人就办不了，也用不着个人办。我们有些农民现在很多盖了房子，就拿盖房子这种事来说吧，眼下我们乡里盖房子再新再讲究，也比不过苏联农民的房子吧？拿布匹来说，就是在中国，过了五年，花样也会过时，新出的布也会更漂亮更便宜。如果谁现在把这些生活资料积存下来，放到社会主义完全实现的时候，他自己也会嘲笑自己的。
    到了社会主义完全实现的时候，农业生产资料是什么样子呢？把现在大家用的犁耙、绳索“集合”起来，是建立不起苏联那样的集体农庄的。苏联的农业生产资料，像拖拉机等许多农业机器，是归国家的拖拉机站所有的；也有一些机器和比较小的水电站是农庄所有的；农民还有自己的小块园地，要修理果子树，要锄锄地等等，所以农民个人也还有些小的生产资料。我们有些农民唯恐生产资料到社会主义要统统归公，其实，锄头、镰刀、绳索之类，归了公又有多大用处呢？现在的农业生产合作社，是也有些公有的生产资料的。可是，那也不是无代价“充公”的，是社员们自愿折价入股的，或者是用公积金买的。社会主义的生产资料公有，决不是没收大家的犁耙、绳索之类的东西。农民们尽管放心添置生产资料好了；只有多添生产资料，参加互助合作，努力增加生产，才是“扩大家业”的根本办法。
