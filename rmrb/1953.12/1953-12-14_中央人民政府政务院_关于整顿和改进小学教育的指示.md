    State Council of the Central People's Government
    Instructions on Rectifying and Improving Primary School Education
    (Adopted at the 195th meeting of the State Council on November 26, 1953)
    For more than four years, primary school education throughout the country has been restored and has greatly exceeded the scale before liberation. The current number of primary school students has reached more than 55 million, an increase of 135 percent compared to the highest year for primary school students in old China (1946). Preliminary reforms have also been carried out in the content and teaching methods of primary school education. The vast majority of primary school teachers have generally participated in various social reform movements and political studies, and thus have taken a step forward in their political awareness. They have made great efforts to educate the new generation, and many of them have become outstanding people's teachers. All these have laid a preliminary foundation for further improving primary school education in the future. However, it must be pointed out that there are still many very serious problems in the current primary school education work. On the one hand, the quality of the original teachers is generally low, and school buildings and equipment are simple. In addition, the rapid development in the past one or two years has failed to adequately consider and solve the problems of teachers and school buildings, resulting in serious chaos in schools and poor teaching quality. On the other hand, due to the increasing political awareness of the people and the improvement of their economic life, the demand for culture is increasing. The existing schools cannot fully meet the needs of the masses for their children to attend school, especially in industrial and mining areas and large cities. All these are difficulties brought about by victorious development, which we must and can gradually solve. However, it should also be recognized that this situation will require great efforts over a considerable period of time in the future to change. Now, the following instructions are given on some of the main problems existing in the current primary school education:
    (1) Primary school education is the foundation of the entire education construction. Its task is to educate the new generation and make them sound citizens of the new China. Starting from the possible conditions for current education construction and the actual situation of the people's cultural demands, primary school education should be developed in a planned and focused manner in the next few years on the basis of rectification and consolidation.
    Due to the gradual industrialization of the country, the urban population is increasing rapidly, while the proportion of primary schools in cities has generally increased less than in rural areas in the past few years. Therefore, in industrial and mining areas, cities, especially large cities, public primary schools should be appropriately developed. At present, conditions such as teachers and school buildings are generally lacking. All localities must actively adopt various methods according to their specific local conditions, such as adjusting classes, increasing enrollment, adopting a two-shift system, opening night schools, assisting industrial and mining enterprises, institutions, and organizations in running schools, assisting in running private schools, allowing the masses and industrialists and businessmen to continue to run schools, and using other various feasible methods to appropriately solve the problem of primary school graduates entering higher education and school-age children entering school.
    In rural areas, in order to appropriately solve the problem of farmers' children attending school, private primary schools (including complete primary schools) should be promoted according to the needs and the principle of voluntariness, and the enthusiasm of the masses for running schools themselves should be fully utilized. People's governments at all levels must attach sufficient importance to this, strengthen guidance, and help solve problems such as teachers and teaching materials. For rural public primary schools, except for appropriate development in ethnic minority areas and old revolutionary base areas where there are fewer schools, other areas should focus on rectification and improvement, and generally do not develop them.
    (2) Due to the uneven economic development of our country, the development of primary school education is also uneven. We should adopt various forms and put forward different requirements for running primary school education according to different situations. It is impossible to require uniformity in primary schools throughout the country. In the future, we should first focus on running urban primary schools, primary schools in industrial and mining areas, complete rural primary schools, and central primary schools well. In rural areas, in addition to running centralized formal primary schools, we can also run decentralized informal primary schools, such as half-day classes, morning classes, and night schools.
    (3) Primary school education is the people's basic education. In the future, for a considerable period of time, primary school students will mainly participate in labor production after graduation, and only a part of them will enter higher education. Therefore, in the usual education in schools, we should not unilaterally emphasize how students will enter higher education after graduation, but should emphasize how to engage in labor production after graduation, cultivate students' ideological feelings and labor habits of loving labor, and overcome the current tendency of some students to despise physical labor. At the same time, we must explain this principle clearly to the people. From now on, people's governments at all levels and all primary school teachers should carry out this propaganda and education work among the people and primary school students.
    (4) Teaching is the overriding central task in schools. The main tasks of principals and teachers are teaching, and the main task of students is learning. In order to correct the tendency of teachers and students to participate in too many social activities and non-teaching activities within the school, overcome the current chaos in schools, do a good job in teaching, improve teaching effectiveness, and enhance the health of teachers and students, the following regulations are hereby made:
    1. The work and study of primary schools shall be uniformly led and arranged by the education administrative departments. Other units and organizations shall not directly assign work to schools, so as not to hinder the progress of the school's work plan.
    2. During the semester, the time for teachers to participate in community activities inside and outside the school shall not exceed twelve hours per person per month, and during the winter and summer vacations, it shall not exceed one-sixth of the entire vacation (including centralized study during the vacation); during the semester, the time for students to participate in community activities inside and outside the school shall not exceed one and a half hours per person per week.
    3. The work of primary school teachers shall not be transferred casually, so that they can work with peace of mind and be familiar with the situation of children, so as to improve teaching effectiveness.
    4. The classrooms and offices of the school shall not be borrowed arbitrarily during the semester; in case it is necessary to borrow them, it should also be done in the spare time after class, so as not to hinder teachers' preparation and students' homework.
    5. Appropriately streamline non-teaching organizations within schools, reduce meetings, and reduce the concurrent positions of teachers and principals.
    6. All localities and schools should formulate a curriculum and teaching progress based on the teaching plan stipulated by the Central Ministry of Education, combined with the specific local conditions, and conduct classes in accordance with the curriculum and teaching progress, and establish attendance checks, leave applications, and grade assessment systems. Except for holidays stipulated by the government, schools shall not arbitrarily suspend classes or have holidays, and teachers shall not arbitrarily be absent from class. During the busy farming season, rural primary schools may grant agricultural leave or allow older students to ask for leave to help with production at home.
    7. Improve teaching methods. Teachers are required to prepare lessons carefully and teach classes carefully, and pay attention to intuitive teaching as much as possible. Teachers are encouraged to lead students to collect and make specimens themselves, and make simple models, etc.
    8. The guidance and management of primary school students should rely on patient persuasion and education. It is necessary to prohibit the use of corporal punishment and struggle and other crude methods, and it is also necessary to oppose laissez-faire. Discipline education should be strengthened so that students develop the habit of consciously observing discipline. Teachers are encouraged to care for students, and students respect teachers, and develop a good atmosphere of friendship and unity between teachers and students and between classmates.
    9. Strengthen school sports and extracurricular cultural and recreational activities, and pay attention to allowing teachers and students to rest in their spare time and on Sundays to enhance their physical fitness and ensure the healthy development of students' physical and mental health.
    (5) Improving the quality of primary school teachers is the decisive factor in running primary school education well. In the future, in-service teachers must be organized to study in a guided and planned manner to improve their political, cultural, and professional levels. Teachers with a level of graduation from a junior normal school (hereinafter referred to as junior normal) or above should focus on studying politics and professional skills. Teachers who have not reached the level of graduation from junior normal should mainly make up for the coursework of junior normal to improve to the level of graduation from junior normal. There are three main ways to organize such teachers to make up for the coursework of junior normal: First, transfer teachers with a high school level to study in junior normal; second, run teacher training courses to absorb teachers with a first or second grade junior high school level for one to two years of training; third, establish teacher spare-time continuing education schools and correspondence schools to organize teachers to conduct on-the-job study. Improving the quality of teachers is a long-term and regular work, and it cannot be required to be too high or too urgent, and attention must be paid to combining it with the actual situation to prevent formalism.
    The primary school teacher team should be properly reorganized. Those with a cultural level that is too low and who are truly unable to teach should be actively helped to enter higher education or change jobs. Those who are suitable for returning home to produce should be mobilized to return home to produce. For those who are old and weak and unable to continue teaching or who have serious infectious diseases that affect the health of children, they should be properly resettled according to the specific situation. Teachers who enter higher education or change jobs will be given a one-month salary as a living allowance in addition to a travel allowance; teachers who return home to produce will be given a two-month salary in addition to a travel allowance as a living allowance; those who need resettlement and have special difficulties may be given one to two months' salary at the discretion. The reorganization of the teacher team must be carried out with caution, and we must pay attention to preventing chaos from being caused by this. The surplus teachers should be properly resettled in a spirit of active responsibility; before they are resettled, they should continue to maintain their original salary and should not be abandoned.
    (6) At present, there are a considerable number of over-aged students in rural primary schools. This is a good phenomenon of the working people's demand for learning culture after the victory of the revolution, and the people's government should take care of it. Therefore, the over-aged students who have already entered school should not only be allowed to continue to stay in school to study, but also should be actively taught well. They must not be squeezed out of school with an irresponsible and rash attitude. In order to better organize over-aged students to study, in places where there are many over-aged students and there are appropriate teacher conditions, accelerated classes can be set up for them in primary schools, or accelerated primary schools can be set up for them separately. In places where there are accelerated classes, accelerated schools, and well-run perennial private schools, the age of children entering school in the future should generally not exceed twelve full years for primary school and sixteen full years for senior primary school, and students entering the class should follow this example. In places where there are no accelerated classes, accelerated schools, and perennial private schools, appropriate care should still be given to the enrollment of over-aged students. In order to ensure the sound physical and mental development of children, the enrollment of children under school age should be strictly restricted in the future.
    (7) Regarding the five-year consistent system of primary school, judging from the implementation situation, it is not suitable to continue to promote it due to insufficient preparation of conditions such as teachers and teaching materials. Therefore, it has been temporarily suspended from this school year. The primary school system still uses the four-two system, divided into primary and senior levels. The primary school term is four years, and the senior school term is two years.
    (8) We must earnestly care about the political and material treatment of primary school teachers. Cadres at all levels and the people should realize that primary school teachers are the educators of the new generation and shoulder a glorious and arduous task. They should be respected to strengthen their enthusiasm for serving the people. Any act of discrimination and exclusion against primary school teachers is wrong and must be corrected. The current salary of primary school teachers will generally remain the same for the time being, but teachers with many children, with special difficulties, who rely on wages for a living and have no other income must be given appropriate subsidies. After the rectification of primary school work is completed, grading work can be carried out in a guided manner according to the teacher's professional ability and teaching experience, and the local situation and the budget indicators for the next year should be taken into consideration, and those with wages that are too low can be appropriately adjusted.
    (9) Regarding the management method of primary school education funds, from January 1, 1954, all localities should include them in the budgets at all levels according to the administrative leadership relationship of the primary schools. The repair and construction costs and equipment costs of urban public primary school buildings shall be paid from the budgets of the city and county governments. The repair, construction and equipment of rural public primary school buildings shall be solved by the people's governments of the counties as a whole. If there are any deficiencies, funds and materials may be raised on the principle of voluntary contribution from the masses, or the method of mass contribution of labor and materials may be adopted. If there is any mobile land left in the land reform in the counties, a part of it should be designated as school land under the control of the county to make up for the deficiency in primary school funds if possible.
    (10) Rectifying and improving primary school education is an arduous and meticulous task. The people's governments of all provinces and cities should attach great importance to it and strengthen their leadership over this work. First of all, we should conduct investigations and studies to grasp the situation. For example, the basic figures such as the number of primary schools, classes, students, and faculty and staff must be investigated clearly. Then, according to the specific circumstances of each locality, we will conduct key trials, gain experience, formulate plans, and proceed cautiously and step by step. This work should be basically completed by the first half of 1954.
    (11) In order to strengthen the leadership of primary school education, all localities must pay attention to strengthening the education administrative leadership at the county level and below. In the next one or two years, cadres with strong political and professional skills should be planned and equipped to enrich and improve the county-level education administrative institutions. We should actively help the education departments establish systematic and regular business work, and do not allocate them too much to do other work. We should urge them to study the business of their departments diligently, from unfamiliar to familiar, and from layman to expert. The education administrative cadres of the counties and districts should not be transferred easily to ensure that they are familiar with the business and do a good job in leading the people's education.

    中央人民政府政务院
    关于整顿和改进小学教育的指示
    （一九五三年十一月二十六日政务院第一百九十五次政务会议通过）
    四年多来，全国小学教育已经恢复并且大大超过了解放前的规模。目前小学生人数已达五千五百余万，较之旧中国历史上小学生数最高年份（一九四六年）增加了百分之一百三十五。在小学教育的内容与教学方法方面也进行了初步改革。广大的小学教师一般都参加过各种社会改革运动和政治学习，因而在政治觉悟上已提高了一步。他们为教育新后代作了很大的努力，其中有不少人已成为优秀的人民教师。这些都为今后进一步办好小学教育打下了初步基础。但必须指出，当前小学教育工作中还存在着很多很严重的问题。一方面是原有师资质量一般低，校舍设备简陋，加上近一、二年来发展很快，又未能适当地考虑解决师资校舍等问题，以致学校的混乱现象很严重，教学质量还很差；另方面，由于人民群众政治觉悟提高，经济生活上升，对文化要求日益增长，现有的学校还不能完全满足群众子女入学的要求，特别在工矿区和大城市问题更严重。所有这些都是胜利发展中带来的困难，我们必须而且也是能够逐步加以解决的。但也应该认识，这种情况需要在今后相当长的时期内作很大的努力，才能加以改变。现在特就当前小学教育中存在的一些主要问题，作如下指示：
    （一）小学教育是整个教育建设的基础。它的任务是教育新后代，使之成为新中国的健全的公民。从当前教育建设的可能条件与人民群众文化要求的实际情况出发，今后几年内小学教育应在整顿巩固的基础上，有计划有重点地发展。
    由于国家逐步工业化，城市人口增加较快，而过去几年内城市小学增加的比例一般地较乡村为小，因此，在工矿区、城市、特别是大城市，公立小学应作适当发展。目前师资、校舍等条件一般缺乏，各地必须根据当地具体情况，积极采取各种办法，如调整班级，充实学额，采用二部制，开办夜校，协助工矿企业、机关和团体办学，协助办好私立学校，允许群众和工商业家继续兴办学校，并用其他各种可行的办法，适当地解决初小毕业生升学和学龄儿童入学的问题。
    在农村，为适当解决农民子女入学的问题，应根据需要与自愿的原则，提倡民办小学（包括完全小学），充分发挥群众自己办学的积极性。各地人民政府对此必须有足够的重视，加强指导，帮助解决师资、教材等问题。对乡村公立小学，除在学校较少的少数民族地区和老革命根据地应作适当发展外，其他地区均应以整顿提高为主，一般不作发展。
    （二）由于我国经济发展不平衡，小学教育的发展也不平衡。我们应根据不同的情况，采取多种形式，提出不同的要求来办小学教育；如果要求全国小学整齐划一，那是做不到的。今后应首先着重办好城市小学、工矿区小学、乡村完全小学和中心小学。在农村，则除办集中的正规的小学外，还可以办分散的不正规的小学，如半日班、早学、夜校之类。
    （三）小学教育是人民的基础教育。今后在相当长的时期内，小学学生毕业后，主要是参加劳动生产，升学的还只能是一部分。因此，在学校平时教育中不应片面强调学生毕业后如何升学，而应强调毕业后如何从事劳动生产，培养学生热爱劳动的思想感情和劳动习惯，克服目前有些学生轻视体力劳动的倾向。同时要把这个道理向人民群众解释清楚。从现在起，各级人民政府和全体小学教师即应在人民群众和小学生中进行此项宣传教育工作。
    （四）教学是学校中压倒一切的中心任务，校长与教师的主要任务是教学，学生的主要任务是学习。为了纠正教师、学生过多地参加社会活动和校内非教学活动的偏向，克服当前学校中的混乱现象，做好教学工作，提高教学效果，增强师生健康，特作如下规定：
    1、小学校的工作和学习，应由教育行政部门统一领导布置，其他单位和团体，不得直接向学校布置工作，以免妨害学校工作计划的进行。
    2、教师在学期当中，参加校内外社团活动时间，每人每月不得超过十二小时，寒暑假期间不得超过整个假期的六分之一（假期集中学习包括在内）；学生在学期当中，参加校内外社团活动时间，每人每周不得超过一小时半。
    3、对小学教师的工作，不得随便调动，使能安心工作，熟悉儿童情况，以提高教学效果。
    4、学校的教室与办公室，在学期当中，不得任意借用；万一必须借用，亦应在课余时间，以免妨碍教师备课与学生作业。
    5、适当精简学校内的非教学组织，减少会议，减少教师与校长的兼职。
    6、各地各学校应根据中央教育部规定的教学计划，结合当地具体情况，制订课程表及教学进度，并按照课程表与教学进度上课，建立出席检查、请假、成绩考核等制度。除政府规定的假日外，学校不得任意停课、放假，教师不得随意旷课。在农忙时节，农村小学得酌放农忙假或准许年龄较大的学生请假，使能回家帮助生产。
    7、改进教学方法。要求教师认真备课和认真教课，并尽可能地注意直观教学，提倡教师带领学生自己动手搜集、制作标本，并制作简单模型等。
    8、对小学生的教导管理，应该依靠耐心的说服教育，既要禁止采用体罚和斗争等粗暴方式，又要反对放任不管。应加强纪律教育，使学生养成自觉地遵守纪律的习惯。提倡教师爱护学生，学生尊敬教师，养成师生间和同学间友爱团结的优良风气。
    9、加强学校体育运动与课外文化娱乐活动，注意使师生在课余时间和星期日得到休息，以增强师生体质和保证学生身心健康的发展。
    （五）提高小学教师质量，是办好小学教育的决定因素。今后必须有领导地、有计划地组织在职教师进行学习，以提高他们的政治、文化与业务水平。凡具有初级师范学校（以下简称初师）毕业程度以上的教师，应着重学习政治与业务。凡不到初师毕业程度的教师，主要是补习初师的课业，以提高到初师毕业的水平。对于组织这类教师补习初师课业的主要方式有三：一是抽调有高小程度的教师到初师学习；二是办师资轮训班，吸收有初级中学一、二年级程度的教师予以一至二年的训练；三是设立教师业余进修学校及函授学校组织教师进行在职学习。提高教师质量是一件长期的经常的工作，不能要求过高过急，并须注意结合实际情况，防止形式主义。
    对于小学教师的队伍，应作适当整顿。对那些文化水平过低，确实无力任教者，应积极帮助他们升学或转业，其中适于回家生产者，则应动员回家生产。对某些年老力衰、不能继续任教或有严重传染病影响儿童健康者，应根据具体情况，分别予以妥善安置。对升学或转业的教师，除酌发路费外，一律发给一个月工资作为生活补助费；对回家生产者，除酌发路费外，并一次发给两个月的工资，作为生活补助费；对需要安置和有特殊困难者，得酌情多发一至两个月的工资。整顿教师队伍，必须慎重从事，应切实注意防止因此而引起混乱现象。对编余教师，应本积极负责的精神，作妥善安置；在未予安置前，仍应继续维持原薪，不得弃置不顾。
    （六）目前农村小学有相当数量的超龄生，这是革命胜利后劳动人民要求学习文化的一种好现象，人民政府应予以照顾。因此，对已入学的超龄生，不仅应让他们继续留校学习，而且还应积极地把他们教好，决不能采取不负责任的轻率态度，把他们挤出校外。为了更好地组织超龄生学习，在超龄生多而又有适当师资条件的地方，可在小学内为他们办速成班，或为他们单独办速成小学。在有速成班、速成学校和办理较好的常年民校的地方，今后入学儿童年龄，初级小学最高以不超过十二足岁，高级小学最高以不超过十六足岁为原则，插班生依此类推。在没有速成班、速成学校和常年民校的地方，对于超龄生入学，仍应适当照顾。为了保证儿童身心发育健全，今后应严格限制不足学龄的儿童入学。
    （七）关于小学五年一贯制，从执行情况看来，由于师资教材等条件准备不足，不宜继续推行。因此已从本学年起，一律暂行停止推行。小学学制仍沿用四二制，分初、高两级。初级修业期限四年，高级修业期限二年。
    （八）要切实关心小学教师的政治待遇与物质待遇。各级干部和人民群众，应认识小学教师是新后代的培育者，肩负着光荣而艰巨的任务，应尊重他们，以加强他们为人民服务的热忱，任何歧视和排斥小学教师的行为，都是错误的，必须予以纠正。对于小学教师的工资，目前一般暂维现状，但对依靠工资为生而没有其他收入的多子女的、有特殊困难的教师，必须酌予补助。在整顿小学工作告一段落后，可根据教师业务能力和教龄，有领导地进行评级工作，并照顾当地情况及明年度预算指标，对少数工资过低者酌予调整。
    （九）关于小学教育经费的管理办法，自一九五四年一月一日起，各地应按小学的行政领导关系分别列入各级预算。城市公立小学校舍的修缮、修建费及设备费，都由各该市、县政府预算开支。乡村公立小学校舍的修缮、修建以及增添设备，由各该县人民政府统筹解决，如有不足，得在群众自愿的原则下筹款备料，或采取群众献工献料等办法加以解决。各县在土地改革中如留有机动土地，在可能条件下，应划出一部分作为学田，由县掌握，以弥补小学经费之不足。
    （十）整顿和改进小学教育，是一项艰巨而细致的工作。各省市人民政府应予以十分重视，并加强对这一工作的领导。首先应进行调查研究，掌握情况，如对于小学的校数、班数、学生、教职员工等基本数字必须调查清楚。然后根据各地具体情况，重点试办，取得经验，订出计划，慎重地、有步骤地进行。此项工作应在一九五四年上半年基本上完成。
    （十一）为了加强对小学教育的领导，各地必须注意加强县级及县以下的教育行政领导。在今后一、二年内应有计划地大力配备政治上和业务上较强的干部，充实和健全县级教育行政机构。应积极地帮助教育部门建立系统的经常的业务工作，不要过多地分配他们作其他工作，督促他们勤于钻研本部门业务，由不熟悉到熟悉，由外行变成内行。对县区教育行政干部，不要轻易调动，以保证他们熟悉业务，把人民教育的领导工作作好。

                      一九五三年十二月十一日
