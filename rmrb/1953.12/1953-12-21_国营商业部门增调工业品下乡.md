    State-owned Commercial Departments Increase the Supply of Industrial Products to Rural Areas
    [From our own correspondent] State-owned commercial departments throughout the country are actively transferring large quantities of industrial products to rural areas, striving to meet the needs of farmers for means of production and livelihood after selling surplus grain and cash crops.
    The quantity and variety of industrial products allocated to rural areas by state-owned commercial departments this year have increased significantly compared to last year. China General Merchandise Company, China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation, China National Hardware and Machinery Corporation, China National Chemical Raw Materials Corporation, China National Petroleum Corporation, and the China National Monopoly Bureau all exceeded their sales plans in November. State-owned commercial departments in East China increased the supply of industrial products to rural areas by more than 35,000 tons beyond the original supply plan. This batch of industrial products includes 2.5 million bolts of cloth suitable for farmers' needs, 14,000 tons of daily necessities, 5,000 tons of sugar, and 5,000 tons of kerosene. Since August, the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation has been increasing the supply of cloth to rural areas month by month, especially increasing the amount of cloth transferred to the grain-producing areas of Hunan Province in the Central South and the cotton-producing areas of Hebei Province in North China. The Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China General Merchandise Company has greatly increased the supply of towels, socks, cardigan undershirts, coarse woolen yarn, enamel basins, bamboo shell water bottles, rubber shoes, rickshaw tires, flashlights, and other commodities that are most popular with rural peddlers to farmers in the second half of the year. Recently, it has also purchased various engraved mirrors, colored hair clips, combs, small-sized soaps, vanishing cream, hair tonic, and other commodities that are most popular on rural peddler's poles. In November, the state-owned commercial system in Wuhan, Central South, transferred pig iron, steel, cloth, general merchandise, cigarettes, coal, pigments, nails, and other goods worth several hundred billion yuan to grain, cotton, and other cash crop producing areas. The amount of industrial products transferred by Hunan Province in the fourth quarter will reach 700,000 tons per month, exceeding the amount of any previous month. The amount of sugar supplied to rural areas in Northeast China this autumn increased by 44.2 percent compared to last year, and glass increased by 34.4 percent. In organizing the supply of winter protection products, the state-owned commercial departments in Northeast China prepared more than 20 kinds of leather hats with different specifications and qualities for Heilongjiang Province, of which coarse leather hats such as mink, dog skin, and wolf skin accounted for 80 percent, as well as felt hat crowns, kang felt, sheepskin robes (unlined leather coats), leather hand muffles, etc., and also prepared "Liute" (light and warm high-topped leather boots) for farmers in Heihe Prefecture, the northernmost border area of our country. The Chongqing Purchasing and Supply Station of the China General Merchandise Company ships about 8,000 tons of goods every month along the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the Yangtze River, the Jialing River, and various highways to the vast rural areas. The Tianjin Purchasing and Supply Station of the China General Merchandise Company exceeded the monthly supply plan by 17.19 percent in November. Many major commodities exceeded the monthly supply plan by about 40 to 200 percent. Most of these items are transferred to cities such as Shenyang, Changchun, Jilin, Andong, and Shijiazhuang, and then supplied to rural areas through wholesale organizations. The colors, varieties, and quality also take into account the characteristics of rural areas in various places.
    In order to facilitate farmers to buy what they need nearby after selling grain and cotton, state-owned commercial companies have especially strengthened assistance to rural supply and marketing cooperatives. In mid-November, the Beijing General Merchandise Company held a commodity exhibition, inviting district cooperatives affiliated to the Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and the Tongxian Prefecture Supply and Marketing Cooperative and its affiliated county cooperatives. Through the commodity exhibition, the relationship with the cooperative was further strengthened, and industrial products worth about 5.2 billion yuan were sold to the cooperative system, most of which were supplied to farmers. The Changsha Purchasing and Supply Station of the Hunan Provincial Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company sent cadres to various grassroots cooperatives through the county cooperative to help salespersons understand specifications, organize shelves, and improve sales methods to help sell cloth, so that farmers who buy cloth from the cooperative can buy the cloth they want. The Changzhou Department Store in Jiangsu Province has established a business communication network with 45 surrounding cooperatives to communicate demand information in a timely manner.
    In order to ensure timely supply to farmers, state-owned commercial departments in various places are organizing various means of transportation, improving allocation methods, and strengthening transfer work. The Chongqing Purchasing and Supply Station of the China General Merchandise Company arranges commodities in order and allocates them in a planned manner according to traffic routes, distance, needs, and time constraints, giving special consideration to the needs of grain and cash crop areas and industrial and mining areas, overcoming the shortcomings of slow allocation and disordered varieties in the past, and saving commodity circulation costs. In the three provinces of Xikang, Yunnan, and Guizhou, where freight transportation is difficult, in addition to using modern transportation tools as much as possible, they also try to organize other means of transportation. Since the fourth quarter of this year, the Northwest Highway Administration, in view of the large number of industrial products being allocated, has worked with the transportation departments of Gansu Province and Xinjiang Province to formulate and implement various measures to improve transportation work and fully utilize transportation capacity.
    The New Year and Spring Festival are approaching, and state-owned commercial departments in various regions are actively preparing New Year goods and fully supplying farmers with festive supplies.

    国营商业部门增调工业品下乡
    【本报讯】全国各地国营商业部门积极调运大批工业品下乡，努力供应农民出卖余粮及经济作物后对生产、生活资料的需要。
    今年各地国营商业部门下拨的工业品，在数量和品种上比去年都有很大增加。中国百货、花纱布、五金机械、化工原料、石油、专卖事业等公司，十一月份都超额完成销售计划。华东区各地国营商业部门在原供应计划外，增加供应农村三万五千多吨工业品。这批工业品包括二百五十万匹适合农民需要的布匹，一万四千吨日用百货，五千吨食糖和五千吨煤油。中国花纱布公司上海采购供应站自八月份起，对农村的布匹供应量逐月增加，尤其是调往中南区湖南省产粮区和华北区河北省产棉区的布匹数量增加最大。中国百货公司上海采购供应站下半年供应农民的毛巾、袜子、开襟卫生衫、粗绒线、搪瓷面盆、竹壳水瓶、胶鞋、力车胎、电筒等商品大大增加。最近还购进各种刻花镜子、彩花发夹、插梳、小号香皂、雪花膏、生发油等农村货郎担上最畅销的商品。中南区武汉市国营商业系统十一月份调往粮棉和其他经济作物产区的生铁、钢、布匹、百货、纸烟、煤、颜料、钉等值数千亿元。湖南省第四季度每月下调工业品的数量将达七十万吨，超过历年任何一月的数量。东北区今年秋后供应农村的糖类，比去年增加了百分之四十四点二，玻璃增加了百分之三十四点四。东北区国营商业部门在组织防寒品供应中，给黑龙江省准备了不同规格质量的皮帽子二十多种，其中川鼠、狗皮、狼皮等粗皮帽子达百分之八十，并有毡帽头、炕毡、绵羊皮大哈（无面的皮大衣）、皮手闷子等，并为我国最北边境的黑河专区农民准备了“溜特”（轻而暖的高装皮靴）。中国百货公司重庆采购供应站每月约有八千吨商品沿着成渝铁路、长江和嘉陵江和各条公路源源运往广大农村。中国百货公司天津采购供应站在十一月份超额百分之十七点一九完成月度供应计划。其中很多主要商品超额百分之四十至二百左右完成月度供应计划。这些物品大部分调往沈阳、长春、吉林、安东、石家庄等城市，再通过批发机构供应农村。在花色、品种和质量上，也照顾到各地农村的特点。
    为了便利农民在出售粮棉后能就近买到自己所需要的东西，国营商业各公司特别加强了对农村供销合作社的帮助。北京市百货公司在十一月中旬举办了商品展览会，分别邀请北京市供销合作社所属区合作社、通县专区供销合作社及其所属县合作社，通过商品展览会进一步密切了和合作社的关系，销给合作社系统工业品总值约五十二亿多元，其中大部分是供应农民的。湖南省花纱布公司长沙采购供应站派干部通过县合作社到各基层社帮助营业员认识规格、整理货架，改善推销方法，帮助销布，使向合作社买布农民买到合意的布匹。江苏省常州百货商店和周围四十五个合作社建立了业务通讯网，及时沟通要货情况。
    为了做到及时供应农民，各地国营商业部门正组织各种运输工具、改进调拨办法，加强调运工作。中国百货公司重庆采购供应站根据交通路线、地区远近、需要多少及时间的缓急，特别照顾粮食、经济作物地区及工矿区的需要，进行商品排队，有计划地调拨，克服了过去调拨迟缓、品种错乱的缺点，节约了商品流转费用。货运困难的西康、云南、贵州三省，除了尽量使用现代运输工具外，还多方设法组织其他运输工具。西北公路管理局自今年第四季度开始，针对大量工业品下拨情况，会同甘肃省和新疆省的交通运输部门，拟订和实施了各项改进运输工作的措施，充分运用运输力量。
    新年、春节即将到来，各地区国营商业部门正积极筹备年货，充分供应农民过节用品。
