Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 21st: Shanghai's state-owned commercial units for cotton yarn and fabrics, general merchandise, transportation and electrical equipment, pharmaceuticals, and petroleum have all completed their annual expanded supply plans ahead of schedule by December 12th. Furthermore, three units have completed their annual expanded procurement plans ahead of schedule. These units are responsible for supplying a significant portion of industrial goods to state-owned companies across the country. Their early completion of the annual expanded supply plans has a significant impact on ensuring the needs of the people nationwide, stabilizing the market, and supporting the state's grain and cotton procurement work in rural areas. Take the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Cotton Yarn and Fabrics Corporation as an example. As of December 11th, the quantity of cotton cloth shipped to various parts of the country by this station exceeded the original annual plan by 21.5% and was 40% higher than the supply volume of the previous year. If this cotton cloth were used to make single-layer garments, it could provide each of 300 million people with a set. As of December 12th, the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National General Merchandise Corporation supplied various daily necessities to the country with a value 35.2% greater than the original annual plan. In the fourth quarter alone, supplementary supplies to meet the needs of rural areas included over 152,000 dozens of various undershirts and pants, cotton-flannel shirts and pants, and athletic shirts and pants, over 134,900 dozens of various rubber shoes, 726,000 pounds of yarn, and over 560,000 dozens of socks.

Currently, the employees of various purchasing and supply units are continuing to launch a labor emulation campaign centered on "fast procurement, fast allocation, and fast transportation," striving to supply more industrial products to rural areas and support the procurement of grain and cotton. Before the end of the year, the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the Cotton Yarn and Fabrics Corporation will also oversupply approximately four million bolts of various cotton cloths, which, if used to exchange for grain, could purchase 1.5 billion catties of rice.

The main reason for the early completion of the annual expanded supply plan is the employees of various purchasing and supply stations' efforts to organize sources of goods and expand processing orders. Since the second quarter, the China National General Merchandise Corporation has expanded processing orders. Up to now, the number of contracted manufacturers has grown to over 5,000, and about 80% of the main daily necessities produced by Shanghai's private factories have been purchased by this station. As of December 12th, the amount invested this year has increased by 71.6% compared to the total investment of the previous year. In October, the Purchasing and Supply Station of the Cotton Yarn and Fabrics Corporation signed processing order and exclusive sales contracts with all private dyeing and weaving factories in Shanghai, thus mastering the entire output of cotton cloth in Shanghai. Since the fourth quarter, various stations have launched an increase production and practice economy emulation drive, with purchasing staff going to factories to help them increase production, improve varieties and specifications, and urge them to deliver goods on time. The employees of the supply departments have strengthened ties with sales units in various regions, helping them select goods and adopting measures such as priority supply and advance allocation to grain and cotton producing areas, thus greatly increasing the supply volume and variety of supplies, and making the supplied goods more suitable for the needs of the people in various regions. Up to now, the number of varieties supplied by the Purchasing and Supply Station of the General Merchandise Company has increased to over 10,000, and the Purchasing and Supply Station of the Cotton Yarn and Fabrics Company has supplied thousands of new patterned cloths favored by consumers in various regions. The employees of the transportation departments of various stations have worked hard to improve efficiency, ensuring that goods are shipped out in a timely manner.

    上海五个国营商业单位完成扩大供应计划
    【新华社上海二十一日电】上海市国营花纱布、百货、交通电工器材、医药、石油等五个商业单位到十二月十二日止，已提前完成全年扩大的供应计划，并有三个单位提前完成了全年扩大的购进计划。这些单位负担着供应全国各地国营公司工业品货源的很大部分，他们提前完成全年扩大的供应计划，对保证全国人民的需要、稳定市场、支援国家在农村中的粮食和棉花收购工作有极大的影响。以中国花纱布公司上海采购供应站为例，该站到十二月十一日止运往全国各地的棉布数量要比原来的全年计划多百分之二十一点五，比去年供应量多百分之四十。如用这些棉布做单衣，可分配给三万万人每人一套。中国百货公司上海采购供应站到十二月十二日止，供应全国各种日用品金额比原来的全年计划增加百分之三十五点二；仅第四季度内补充供应各地农村需要的主要商品便有各种卫生衫裤、棉毛衫裤、运动衫裤十五万二千多打，各种胶鞋十三万四千九百多打，绒线七十二万六千多磅，袜子五十六万多打。
    目前各采购供应单位的职工正继续展开以“快进、快调、快运”为中心的劳动竞赛，争取供应更多的工业品给农村，支援粮食和棉花的收购工作。花纱布公司上海采购供应站在年底以前还将超额供应各种棉布四百万匹左右，如用以换取粮食，可购买稻谷十五亿斤。
    各采购供应站职工们努力组织货源，扩大加工订货，是保证全年扩大供应计划提前完成的主要原因之一。中国百货公司自第二季度起便扩大加工订货，到目前为止，订约厂商已发展到五千家以上，上海私营工厂出产的主要日用品已有百分之八十左右为该站所收购。今年投放金额到十二月十二日止，已比去年全年投放额增加百分之七十一点六。花纱布公司采购供应站在十月份内和上海全部私营染织业工厂订立了加工订货包销合约，因而已掌握了上海棉布产量的全部。第四季度起各站开展增产节约竞赛，采购员纷纷下厂，帮助各厂增加产量、改进品种与规格，督促他们按时交货。供应部门的职工加强和各地销售单位的联系，帮助他们选购商品，并对粮食和棉花产区采取优先供应和提前调拨等措施，因而使供应量和供应品种大大增加，供应的商品更加适合各地人民的需要。到目前为止，百货公司采购供应站供应品种已增加到一万种以上，花纱布公司采购供应站供应了几千种为各地消费者所喜爱的新花布。各站运输部门的职工努力提高效率，使商品及时地运出。
