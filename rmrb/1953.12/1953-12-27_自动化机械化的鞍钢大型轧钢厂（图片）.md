Automated and Mechanized Anshan Iron and Steel Large Rolling Mill

The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's large rolling mill held a completion and handover ceremony on the afternoon of December 15th at 3:00 PM. From then on, China's first automated and mechanized large rolling mill was officially declared complete.

This is the heart of the large rolling mill - the main electrical room. Here are giant motors, many complex switchboards and transformers. In addition, there are many DC generators. It is the power source for all the machines in the factory, and through the switchboard and various instruments, you can understand the operation of each part of the machine.

The fiery red steel billets sent from the primary rolling mill are pushed into the furnace and heated to 1200 degrees, and then scraped onto the roller table by the steel extractor and sent to the rolling mill. *People's Daily* Li Yu photo

After the steel billet comes out of the heating furnace, it only takes more than sixty seconds to be rolled into heavy steel rails by the rolling mill. Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Chunde photo

The steel rails rolled by the rolling mill are straightened by the straightening machine.

The large rolling mill received comprehensive assistance from the Soviet Union in design, equipment, installation, commissioning and new product manufacturing. This is a scene of design expert Ksilev and Chinese technicians Li Jian and Chen Dunyu jointly studying metal design drawings. *People's Daily* Zhu Bo photo

The steel rails, after being straightened by the straightening machine, arrive at the fully automated processing line, and undergo three steps of milling, drilling, and quenching to complete the processing of the steel rails. A pair of milling machines first mill the ends of the steel rails; a pair of drilling machines drill three holes on the side of the steel rail for the fishplate bolts when laying the railway; use high-frequency current to heat the ends of the steel rails to 900 degrees for quenching to make the ends hard, withstand the impact of trains back and forth, and not be worn. *People's Daily* Wang Zhiyuan photo

Huge electromagnetic crane. Its advantage is that when transporting steel rails, it ensures that the steel rails will not overlap or collide with each other, avoiding damage. *People's Daily* Wang Zhiyuan photo

The construction of the large rolling mill was a very large and complex project. The selfless labor and creative wisdom of the workers overcame various difficulties. This is the scene of installation workers using electric drills to drill holes in the conveying roller table of the central cooling platform during the construction of the plant. *People's Daily* Zhu Bo photo

The completion of the large rolling mill is inseparable from the active support of the people of the whole country. The machinery manufacturing industries in major cities accepted orders from Anshan Iron and Steel. All parts of the country transported a large number of cadres and various materials needed for the project to Anshan Iron and Steel. These are pine trees from the Xing'an Mountains and tall fir trees cultivated by ethnic minorities in the Xiangxi area of Hunan Province. *People's Daily* Zhu Bo photo

    自动化机械化的鞍钢大型轧钢厂
    鞍山钢铁公司大型轧钢厂，在本月十五日下午三时举行了竣工移交生产仪式。从此我国第一座自动化、机械化的大型轧钢厂就正式宣告完工了。
    这是大型轧钢厂的心脏——主电室。在这里有着巨型的电动机、很多复杂的配电盘和变压器。此外还有许多直流发电机。它是全厂所有机器的电力来源，通过配电盘及各种仪表能够了解各部分机器的运转情况。

    钢胚从加热炉出来之后，只需六十多秒的时间就由轧钢机轧成重型钢轨。　新华社记者　王纯德摄
    轧钢机轧出的钢轨通过矫正机把钢轨压直。

    大型轧钢厂得到苏联从设计、设备、安装、开工运转直到新产品制成的全面帮助。这是设计专家克西列夫和我国技术员李健、陈敦虞共同研究金属设计图样的情形。　本报　朱波摄
    经过矫正机矫正后的钢轨来到完全自动化的加工线上，经过铣头、钻眼和淬火三个步骤完成对钢轨的加工。一对铣头机，先把钢轨两头铣光；一对钻眼机，把钢轨的侧面钻出敷铁路时上夹板螺丝的三个眼；用高周波电流把钢轨两头加热到九百度，进行淬大，使两头坚硬，经得住火车来回冲击，不会被磨损。　本报　王志渊摄
    检查台女标记工杨素清正根据检查的结果，把表示钢轨成品级品的彩色油漆涂在钢轨头上，作为标记。　本报　王志渊摄
    巨大的电磁石吊车。它的优点是在运送钢轨时，保证钢轨不会互相叠压、碰撞，避免损坏。　本报　王志渊摄
    大型轧钢厂的工程是非常浩大而又复杂的，工人们的忘我劳动和创造智慧战胜了各种困难。这是建厂当时安装工人用电钻进行中央冷却台上输送辊道的钻眼工作的情形。　本报　朱波摄
    大型轧钢厂的建成是和全国人民积极支援分不开的。各大城市的机器制造业接受了鞍钢的订货。全国各地向鞍钢输送了大批干部和各种工程所需要的各种材料。这是来自兴安岭的松木和湖南省湘西一带兄弟民族栽培的高大杉木。　本报　朱波摄
