Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 16th: Millions of workers in various enterprises across Italy began a 24-hour national general strike at 6:00 AM on the 15th, as planned, to support demands for increased wages and job security.

This strike has paralyzed all important industrial sectors and public utilities throughout Italy. In addition to sectors such as mining, smelting, machinery manufacturing, textiles, electricity, food, and chemicals, workers in telephone, telegraph, water, gas, and public transportation services also participated in the strike.

The secretariat of the Social Democratic trade union "Italian Labor Union" refused to participate in the strike, but the union's local branches and union members decided to participate on their own.

Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Because the Italian government has pursued the U.S. imperialist policy of expanding armaments, military expenditures have increased year by year, public welfare expenditures have been reduced, direct and indirect taxes have increased, the cost of living has risen, and wages have decreased, the Italian working people have become increasingly impoverished.

This is first reflected in the increase in the number of unemployed. The officially reported number of unemployed has increased from 1,614,900 in 1950 to 2,299,900 in June 1953. But the actual number of unemployed is twice as large as this. Even those who have jobs earn wages that are too meager to maintain a living. In Italy, the cost of living per person per month is 45,000 lire, while a skilled worker earns only 30,000 lire per month, and a young worker earns even less, only 3,000 lire per month. Two million peasant families, about nine million Italians, have a net income of only 200 to 250 lire per person per day, which is only enough for half a pound of meat. The situation of female workers is even worse, as their wages are less than one-third of those of male workers, and they are immediately fired when they become pregnant.

The income of the working people is already so low, but the cost of living continues to rise. The cost of living index in May 1953 was 57 times that of 1938. The difficult living conditions of the Italian people are further aggravated by the lack of housing. A preliminary study of the Italian residents' situation by Social Democratic Party member of parliament Ezio Vigorelli stated that hundreds of thousands of families do not have houses and have to live in cellars, caves, or barracks.

Under these circumstances, the government, regardless of the people's life and death, continues to increase the tax burden on the people. From the fiscal year 1949 to the fiscal year 1952, the amount of direct taxes paid by residents has increased by 50%. As soon as the Pella government came to power, it decided to further increase taxes in the national budget for the 1954 fiscal year to pay for the huge military expenditure of 600 billion lire.

Poor living conditions have caused a large number of diseases among the working people. For example, in Naples, an examination of the physical condition of 8,000 children found that 16.8% of them had active tuberculosis. 51% of the residents in Italy do not receive any medical treatment. Due to difficult living conditions and lack of medical facilities, the infant mortality rate is alarmingly high. In peasant families in the province of Caltanissetta, an average of 106.8 out of every 1,000 children die.

This is a general picture of the lives of the Italian working people. But the Italian working people are unwilling to endure this miserable life. They are continuously holding strikes, parades, and demonstrations to carry out resolute struggles to improve their lives.

### 意大利数百万工人举行总罢工  全国重要工业部门和公用事业陷于瘫痪

    意大利数百万工人举行总罢工
    全国重要工业部门和公用事业陷于瘫痪
    【新华社十六日讯】罗马消息：十五日上午六时，意大利全国各种企业中的数百万工人，按预定计划开始了二十四小时的全国总罢工，支持增加工资和保障职业的要求。
    这次罢工使得意大利全国一切重要工业部门和公用事业陷于瘫痪。除了采矿、冶炼、机器制造、纺织、电气、食品、化学等等部门以外，电话、电报、自来水、煤气和公共运输事业的工人也参加罢工。
    社会民主党工会“意大利劳工联盟”的书记处拒绝参加这次罢工，但联盟的各地方分会和工会群众却自行决定参加罢工。
    【新华社十六日讯】由于意大利政府奉行了美帝国主义的扩张军备政策，军事开支一年年增多，公共福利事业费缩减，直接税与间接税增加，生活指数上涨，工资减少，意大利劳动人民越来越贫困了。
    这首先表现在失业人数的增加上，官方统计的失业人数已从一九五○年的一百六十一万四千九百人增加到一九五三年六月的二百二十九万九千人。但是实际的失业人数要比这大一倍。即使有职业的人，所得的工资也菲薄得无法维持生活。在意大利每人每月的生活费要意大利币四、五万里拉，而一个技术工人每月所得只三万里拉，青年工人每月更只有三千里拉，二百万家约九百万人的意大利农民，一个人每天净收入不过二百到二百五十里拉，只够半磅肉的价钱，女工的情况更惨，她们的工资不及男工的三分之一，而当她们怀孕时就立即被解雇。
    劳动人民的收入已经这样低微，而生活费却继续上涨，一九五三年五月的生活费指数已是一九三八年的五十七倍。意大利人民生活的困苦境况还因缺少住房而更形严重。社会民主党议员埃齐奥·维戈雷里关于意大利居民情况初步研究的报告说：成十万家庭没有房子而不得不住在地窖、山洞或兵营里。
    在这种情况下，不顾人民死活的政府还不断加重人民的捐税负担。从一九四九年度到一九五二年度，居民缴纳的直接税额已增加了百分之五十。贝拉政府刚一上台，又决定在一九五四会计年度的国家预算中，以再增加税收的办法来支付庞大的六千亿里拉的军事开支。
    恶劣的生活条件在劳动人民中引起大量疾病。例如，在那不勒斯，检查八千儿童的体格的结果，发现其中有百分之十六点八患活动性肺结核。意大利有百分之五十一的居民，得不到一点医药治疗。由于生活困苦和缺乏医疗设施，儿童死亡率高得惊人，在卡尔坦尼塞塔省的农民家庭里，平均一千儿童中就有一百零六点八人死亡。
    这就是意大利劳动人民生活的大概图景。但是意大利劳动人民是不甘心忍受这种悲惨生活的，他们正连续不断地举行罢工、游行示威，为争取改善生活而进行坚决的斗争。
