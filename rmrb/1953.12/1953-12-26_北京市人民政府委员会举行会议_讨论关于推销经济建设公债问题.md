Xinhua News Agency, December 25th—The Beijing Municipal People's Government Committee held its eleventh meeting on December 25th to discuss the issue of promoting the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds. At the meeting, the committee members spoke enthusiastically.

	Peng Zemin, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, said: The people are enthusiastically supporting the government's issuance of economic construction bonds. Successfully completing the task of promoting bonds will promote the development of our national economy and rapidly increase the degree of socialist industrialization of the country.

	Lei Jieqiong, Director of the Women's Work Committee of the Beijing Branch of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, said: All democratic parties will do their utmost to promote bonds. This is a test of our work since participating in politics, and we will express our patriotism through action.

	Fu Huating, Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: The city's industrial and commercial circles have made ideological and financial preparations. We will overfulfill the obligation to purchase construction bonds in one go. In particular, after studying the general line of the state during the transition period, everyone believes that this is a good opportunity to express their love for the motherland.

	Ma Yuhuai, Deputy Director of the China Islamic Association, said: The Muslims in the city believe that the state's issuance of construction bonds is very necessary. Only the development of industry can provide more employment opportunities for ethnic minorities. The lives of Muslims have greatly improved. Ten percent of the city's Muslims are employed, which is unprecedented in history. Therefore, we have the strength to purchase national economic construction bonds.

	Li Guorui, Manager of the Beijing Water Company, said: The state's issuance of economic construction bonds is in line with the long-term interests of the working class. The amount of this bond issue is very small, and the employees can afford the obligations they should bear. Purchasing bonds has no impact on the lives of employees. On the contrary, promoting bonds promotes the improvement of people's lives.

	Chai Zemin, Chairman of the Beijing Farmers' Association, said: The lives of farmers have greatly improved after the land reform. Especially after studying the general line, their enthusiasm for socialism has greatly increased. They all feel that to greatly increase grain production and fundamentally eliminate poverty, they must be organized. However, it is impossible to organize large-scale land cultivation without the assistance of industry. Therefore, farmers have the strength and will enthusiastically purchase construction bonds and strive for the country's industrialization.

	Cai Tingkai, Liang Sicheng, Le Songsheng, Zheng Yun, Weng Dujian, and Xu Chubo also spoke at the meeting. They all agreed that the economic lives of the people in the capital have greatly improved, their socialist ideological awareness is very high, and all aspects of their work have progressed. They have full confidence that they can complete the task of promoting bonds ahead of schedule and exceed the target.

	The meeting finally approved the establishment of the Beijing Municipal Bond Promotion Committee and passed the list of forty-nine members. Wu Han was appointed as the Chairman, and Li Leguang, Fu Huating, Liu Laifu, and Zhao Fan were appointed as the Vice Chairmen.

    北京市人民政府委员会举行会议
    讨论关于推销经济建设公债问题
   【新华社二十五日讯】北京市人民政府委员会于十二月二十五日举行第十一次会议，讨论关于推销一九五四年国家经济建设公债问题。会上，各委员热烈发言。
    中国农工民主党北京市委员会主任委员彭泽民说：人民以极大的热情拥护政府发行经济建设公债。胜利地完成推销公债任务，将推动我国国民经济的发展，使国家社会主义工业化的程度迅速提高。
    中国民主促进会北京市分会妇女工作委员会主任委员雷洁琼说：各民主党派将尽最大努力推销公债，这是对我们参政以来工作的一次考验，我们将从行动上来表现我们的爱国主义。
    北京市工商业联合会主任委员傅华亭说：全市工商界已从思想上、财力上做好准备，我们将会超额地一次完成购买建设公债的义务。特别是学习了国家在过渡时期的总路线后，无不认为这是表示热爱祖国的良好机会。
    中国伊斯兰教协会副主任马玉槐说：全市的回民认为国家发行建设公债很必要，只有工业的发展才能为少数民族提供更多的就业机会。回民的生活已经有了很大改善，全市百分之十的回民就业，这是历史上所未有的。因此，有力量购买国家经济建设公债。
    北京市自来水公司经理李国瑞说：国家发行经济建设公债，是符合工人阶级的长远利益的。这次公债发行额很小，职工们是可以负担它应负担的义务的。认购公债对职工生活毫无影响，反而因推销公债促进了人民生活的提高。
    北京市农民协会主任柴泽民说：农民在土地改革后生活已有很大改善，尤其在学习总路线后，对社会主义的热情大大高涨，都感到要大量提高粮食产量、根本上消灭贫困，必须组织起来，但组织起来进行大块土地的耕种，没有工业的援助是不可能的，所以农民有力量、也将会踊跃地购买建设公债，为国家的工业化而奋斗。
    在会上发言的还有蔡廷锴、梁思成、乐松生、郑云、翁独健、徐楚波，他们一致认为首都人民的经济生活已有很大改善，社会主义的思想觉悟很高，各项工作都有进步，有充分信心可以提前超额完成推销公债的任务。
    会议最后通过成立北京市公债推销委员会并通过四十九位委员的名单，主任委员为吴晗，副主任委员有李乐光、傅华亭、刘莱夫、赵凡。
