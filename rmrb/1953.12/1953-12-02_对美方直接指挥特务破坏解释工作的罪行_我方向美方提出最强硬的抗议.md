Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 1st – The Korean-Chinese delegation to the Korean Military Armistice Commission issued a communique today as follows:

On November 8, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission intercepted a Syngman Rhee agent entering the Dongchang-ri POW camp from the US-controlled area and found on him a letter conveying instructions from Syngman Rhee himself, the so-called "Commander-in-Chief of the Gendarmerie" of South Korea, and the so-called Busan Embassy of the Chiang Kai-shek remnant gang to the Rhee and Chiang agents in the Dongchang-ri POW camp. This letter once again confirms that the US side is directly directing its deployed agents to completely sabotage the explanation work and to kill our captured personnel who resolutely demand repatriation. In response, the Korean-Chinese side lodged the strongest protest with the US side at the Military Armistice Commission on December 1, and questioned whether the US side recognizes the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces using necessary force in accordance with the provisions of the "Terms of Reference" to restore and exercise its legitimate power to sanction agents and control the Dongchang-ri POW camp, or whether the US side will continue to direct agents to carry out various criminal activities, thereby bearing the serious responsibility for undermining the implementation of the armistice agreement.

In the face of the ironclad evidence of the documents intercepted by the Indian Custodial Forces, the US side had to admit the fact that agents inside and outside the Dongchang-ri POW camp were in contact, but still evaded answering the questions raised by the Korean-Chinese side directly, attempting to shirk its unavoidable serious responsibility. The Korean-Chinese side sternly pointed out: On the one hand, the US side directly instigates agents to carry out various sabotage activities in the Dongchang-ri POW camp, and on the other hand, it openly threatens the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission not to use necessary force to sanction agents and eliminate agent organizations. Its purpose is obviously to continue to maintain its agent activities, so that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces cannot implement the "Terms of Reference," in order to realize its conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war. The US side must bear the serious responsibility for undermining the implementation of the armistice agreement.

The full text of the main speech by Senior Member Li Sang-cho of the Korean-Chinese side at the Military Armistice Commission on December 1 is as follows:

On November 24, 1953, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission formally notified our side that the Indian Custodial Forces intercepted one of your agents entering the Dongchang-ri POW camp from your controlled area on November 8, and found on him a letter conveying instructions from Syngman Rhee himself, the so-called Commander-in-Chief of the Gendarmerie of South Korea, and the so-called Busan Embassy of the Chiang Kai-shek remnant gang to your agents Han Yin-song, Ji Ji-cheol, etc. in the Dongchang-ri POW camp. A photocopy of the letter was sent to our side by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on November 25.

The document intercepted by the Indian Custodial Forces thoroughly reveals that your side not only deployed a large number of agents in the Dongchang-ri POW camp in advance, but also continues to directly control and direct the agent organization in the Dongchang-ri POW camp. Your side sends agents in and out of the Dongchang-ri POW camp to convey the instructions and proclamations of the so-called "President Rhee and his direct executor, the Commander-in-Chief of the Gendarmerie," as well as the orders of the so-called Busan Embassy of the Chiang Kai-shek remnant gang. The intercepted document also conveys the so-called "Instructions of the Commander-in-Chief of the Gendarmerie on Reorganizing the Anti-Communist Youth Corps in the Camp" from your Syngman Rhee group, designating the organization and responsible persons of the agent organization. The document also instructs your agents in the POW camp to listen to the orders of the "Commander-in-Chief of the Gendarmerie" broadcast by your side using codes on the radio provided by your side, and puts forward specific contact signals requiring your agents to report their "work results" according to these signals. The document once again reveals that your side uses the so-called POW hospital provided by your side as a base for agents to illegally carry out various liaison activities. The document intercepted by the Indian Custodial Forces once again shows that your side directly directs your agents to completely sabotage the explanation work in the POW camp and obstruct the repatriation of prisoners of war with inhuman violence. In this document, Syngman Rhee himself, the so-called Commander-in-Chief of the Gendarmerie of South Korea, and the Chiang gang's so-called Busan Embassy instructed your agents in the POW camp that "explanations should not be listened to," and openly claimed that "only by not listening to explanations will the opportunity for the government of the Republic of Korea to launch national power be quickly promoted," "If pro-communist Indian troops use force to force anti-communist youth to listen to explanations," "the national army of the Republic of Korea will attack," "the government of the Republic of Korea will also seize the conditions to release anti-communist youth," The so-called Commander-in-Chief of the Gendarmerie of South Korea even openly ordered your agents to "internally eliminate those who disobey orders," "the ones who want to return to the North must be killed," claiming: "The responsibility will be borne by the Commander-in-Chief of the Gendarmerie," which once again proves that your side bears full and direct responsibility for the incidents in which the Rhee-Chiang agents repeatedly killed our captured personnel in the Dongchang-ri POW camp. The document intercepted by the Indian Custodial Forces undeniably confirms once again your side's various illegal acts of completely undermining the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" of the armistice agreement. The "Terms of Reference" clearly stipulates that in order to ensure that all prisoners of war have the freedom to exercise their right to repatriation, the original detaining party must completely lift its control and influence over the prisoners of war, but your side uses all illegal means to directly direct the agent organization you have deployed to continue to maintain the bloody rule you have been carrying out for a long time. In order to achieve the despicable purpose of forcibly detaining prisoners of war, your side not only sent a large number of agents from the Syngman Rhee group, the Chiang Kai-shek gang, and the US military trained in Tokyo into the Dongchang-ri POW camp to establish a reign of terror, but also used the US military's 64th Hospital provided by your side as a base for contact between agents inside and outside the camp, taking the opportunity to provide logistical support to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to smuggle radios to your agents, using signals to contact and issue orders to your agents in the Dongchang-ri POW camp from your military control area, and frequently sending your agents to illegally enter and leave your military control area and the Dongchang-ri POW camp, directly directing the sabotage activities of your agent organization.

To ensure that all prisoners of war have the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated. The "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" specifically stipulates that the country to which the prisoners of war belong shall have the right to provide explanations to the prisoners of war, but your side not only made long-term arrangements to sabotage the explanation work before signing the "Terms of Reference," but also delayed the construction of the explanation camp and interfered with the explanation work after the prisoners of war were transferred to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and even directly ordered agents to sabotage the explanation work and coerce the prisoners of war not to listen to explanations. The document intercepted by the Indian Custodial Forces completely exposes your shameless lies about prisoners of war refusing to listen to explanations and establishes that the direct instigator of not allowing prisoners of war to listen to explanations is your side.

The "Terms of Reference" clearly stipulates that force or threats of force shall not be used to obstruct the repatriation of prisoners of war, but your side not only persecuted, killed, and forcibly detained countless of our captured personnel who demanded repatriation before our captured personnel were transferred to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, but also directly instigated agents to inhumanly persecute and kill our captured personnel who resolutely demanded repatriation in the Dongchang-ri camp after they were transferred to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.

I lodge the strongest protest with you against your side's continued, unbridled, and serious crimes of tearing up the "Terms of Reference" and undermining the armistice agreement. Due to your side's blatant criminal activities, the Dongchang-ri POW camp is in fact under your side's complete control. Our explanation work has been fundamentally impossible to carry out, and the "Terms of Reference" has been completely destroyed. Under these circumstances, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces have long been unable to exercise their legitimate power to control the camp in accordance with Article 7 of the "Terms of Reference." In order to implement the "Terms of Reference," especially the legitimate duties stipulated in Articles 3, 4, 7, and 8 of the "Terms of Reference," the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces must arrest and punish the main agents, including Han Yin-song, Ji Ji-cheol, and Jin Cheng-lu, confiscate all communication tools and weapons that can be used for killing, investigate the hospital, and revoke all so-called administrative personnel provided by the United Nations forces who are carrying out agent activities in Dongchang-ri. They must clear all agents from the POW camp, disband the existing organizations in the POW camp, reorganize them, and strictly prohibit private contacts between POW camps. In order to do this, in order to restore and exercise its legitimate power to control the camp, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces must use force to sanction the agents' atrocities when taking the above measures encounter threats, sabotage, and obstruction from the agents, to protect the prisoners of war from threats of violence and to be free to exercise their right to be repatriated. For this reason, it is necessary for your side to answer our side: Do you recognize that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces use necessary force in accordance with the provisions of the "Terms of Reference" to restore and exercise its legitimate power to sanction agents and control the camp, or will your side continue the various criminal activities carried out by your side's agents, thereby bearing the serious responsibility for undermining the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement. I await your reply.

### 对美方直接指挥特务破坏解释工作的罪行  我方向美方提出最强硬的抗议

    对美方直接指挥特务破坏解释工作的罪行
    我方向美方提出最强硬的抗议
    【新华社开城一日电】朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中代表团一日发表公报如下：
    中立国遣返委员会于十一月八日截获自美方控制地区进入东场里战俘营的一名李承晚特务，并从他身上搜出传达李承晚本人、南朝鲜所谓“宪兵总司令官”和蒋介石残余匪帮所谓釜山大使馆给予东场里战俘营中的李、蒋特务的指示信一件，该信再一次证实了美方正直接指挥其所布置的特务彻底破坏解释工作，残杀坚决要求遣返的我方被俘人员。对此，朝中方面已在十二月一日的军事停战委员会上对美方提出最强硬的抗议，并质问美方是否承认中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队依照“职权范围”的规定、为恢复和行使其制裁特务和控制东场里战俘营的合法权力而使用必要的武力，或是美方仍将继续指挥特务进行各种罪恶活动，从而承担破坏停战协定的实施的严重责任。
    在印度看管部队所截获的文件的铁证面前，美方不得不承认东场里战俘营内外特务联系的事实，但对于朝中方面所提出的问题则仍逃避正面答复，企图推卸其无可逃避的严重责任。朝中方面严词指出：美方一面直接指使特务在东场里战俘营地进行种种破坏活动，一面公然威胁中立国遣返委员会不得使用必要的武力制裁特务分子、肃清特务组织，其目的显然在于继续维持其特务活动，使中立国遣返委员会与印度看管部队无法实施“职权范围”，以便于实现其强迫扣留战俘的阴谋，美方必须担负破坏停战协定的实施的严重责任。
    朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将在十二月一日军事停战委员会上的主要发言全文如下：
    一九五三年十一月二十四日中立国遣返委员会正式通知我方：印度看管部队于十一月八日截获自你方控制地区进入东场里战俘营的一名你方特务，并从他身上搜出一封传达李承晚本人、南朝鲜所谓宪兵总司令官、和蒋介石残余匪帮所谓釜山大使馆给予东场里战俘营中你方特务韩银松、池基哲等的指示信一件，该信的影印本已由中立国遣返委员会于十一月二十五日送交我方。
      印度看管部队所截获的文件彻底揭露了你方不仅事先在东场里战俘营中布置了大批特务，而且继续直接控制与指挥东场里战俘营内的特务组织。你方派遣特务出入东场里战俘营传达所谓“李总统阁下以及其直接执行者宪兵总司令官”的指示和文告，以及蒋介石残余匪帮所谓釜山大使馆的命令。截获的文件中并传达你方李承晚集团所谓“宪兵总司令官关于重新编制营场内反共青年团的指示”，指定特务组织的编制和负责人选。文件中并指示战俘营中你方特务用你方供给的无线电收听你方用密码广播的“宪兵总司令官”的命令，提出具体的联络信号要求你方特务按此等信号报告其“工作结果”。文件中并再一次揭露了你方利用你方所提供的所谓战俘医院作为特务大本营非法进行各种联络活动。印度看管部队所截获的文件，又一次说明了你方直接指挥你方特务在战俘营内彻底破坏解释工作，以惨无人道的暴力阻挠战俘遣返，就在这一文件中，李承晚本人与南朝鲜所谓宪兵总司令官以及蒋匪所谓釜山大使馆指示战俘营中你方特务“不应听解释”，并公然声称“只有不听解释才会促进大韩民国政府发动国权的机会迅速到来”，“若亲共的印度军人为迫使反共青年听解释而使用武力的话”，“大韩民国的国军将会进击”、“大韩民国政府也将抓住条件释放反共青年”，南朝鲜所谓宪兵总司令官更公然命令你方特务“在内部肃清不服从命令的分子”，“必须杀掉愿回北部的家伙”，声称：“其责任将由宪兵总司令官来负”，这就再一次地证明你方对李蒋特务在东场里战俘营中多次杀害我方被俘人员的事件负有完全的和直接的责任。印度看管部队所截获的文件，不容抵赖地再一次证实了你方彻底破坏停战协定“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的种种非法行为，“职权范围”明确规定为保证所有战俘都有行使其遣返权利的自由，原拘留一方必须完全解除其对战俘的控制与影响，但你方却用尽一切非法的手段直接指挥你方所布置的特务组织继续保持你方所长期进行的血腥统治，为达到强迫扣留战俘的卑鄙目的，你方不仅派遣大批李承晚集团、蒋介石匪帮和美军在东京训练的特务混入东场里战俘营中建立恐怖统治，并且使用你方提供的美军第六十四号医院作营场内外特务联系的大本营，利用向中立国遣返委员会提供后勤支援的机会偷运无线电机给你方特务，从你方军事控制地区向东场里战俘营中的你方特务用信号联络发号施令，并经常派遣你方特务非法出入你方军事控制地区和东场里战俘营，直接指挥你方特务组织的破坏活动。
    为保证全部战俘都有机会行使其被遣返的权利，“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”特别规定战俘所属国家应有权向战俘进行解释，但你方不但在
  “职权范围”签字以前就进行了破坏解释工作的长期布置，而在战俘移交中立国遣返委员会后更拖延解释营场的修建，干扰解释工作的进行，乃至于直接命令特务破坏解释工作，挟持战俘不听解释，印度看管部队所截获的文件完全揭穿了你方恬不知耻的所谓战俘拒绝听取解释的谎话，确立了不让战俘听取解释的直接指使者正是你方。
      “职权范围”明确规定不得使用武力或以武力威胁阻挠战俘的遣返，但你方不仅在我方被俘人员被移交给中立国遣返委员会以前迫害、残杀并用武力扣留了无数要求遣返的我方被俘人员，而且在他们被移交给中立国遣返委员会以后还直接指使特务在东场里营中惨无人道地迫害，并杀死坚决要求遣返的我方被俘人员。
    对于你方继续不断、肆无忌惮地撕毁“职权范围”破坏停战协定的严重罪行，我向你提出最强硬的抗议，由于你方这种明目张胆的罪恶活动，目前东场里战俘营事实上是处于你方的完全控制之下，我方解释工作已经根本无法进行，“职权范围”已被破坏无遗。在这种情势之下，中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队早已无法根据“职权范围”第七款来行使其控制营场的合法权力。为了执行“职权范围”特别是“职权范围”第三、第四、第七、第八各款所规定的合法职务，中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队就必须逮捕并惩办包括韩银松、池基哲、金成禄等在内的首要特务分子，搜缴特务的一切通讯联络工具和可供杀人的武器，清查医院，撤消一切在东场里进行特务活动的联合国军提供的所谓行政人员，他们必须清除战俘营中的一切特务，打散战俘营现有组织，并重新编组，严禁战俘营之间的私自来往，为了这样做，为了恢复并行使其控制营场的合法权力，中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队，在采取上述措施遇到特务的威胁破坏和阻挠时，必须使用武力来制裁特务的暴行，以保障战俘免受暴力威胁，并得自由行使其被遣返的权利。为此你方有必要答复我方：你方是否承认中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队依照“职权范围”的规定为恢复和行使其制裁特务和控制营场的合法权力而使用必要的武力，或者你方仍将继续你方指挥特务所进行的各种罪恶活动，从而承当破坏朝鲜停战协定之实施的严重责任。我等待你的回答。
