Xinhua News Agency, December 5th: The United States has once again cranked up its voting machine in the United Nations General Assembly, passing its proposal to slander the Korean and Chinese side with so-called "atrocities," with one of its aims being to conceal its own towering crimes of massacring, maltreating, and forcibly detaining prisoners of war and civilians over the past three years. However, this despicable trick of "the thief crying 'stop thief!'" cannot deceive anyone. The countless facts admitted by many American prisoners of war after being repatriated regarding our side's lenient treatment of prisoners of war completely prove that the US's so-called "atrocity report" is nothing but a "collection of ghost stories."

In its so-called "atrocity report" submitted to the Eighth United Nations General Assembly, the United States slanders the Korean and Chinese side with massacring prisoners of war on the battlefield. But in fact, almost all the repatriated American prisoners of war admitted that they received good treatment when captured on the battlefield. For example, British prisoner of war Kennedy told Associated Press reporters after repatriation that the Korean and Chinese forces told him when they captured him: "We do not kill prisoners, we treat prisoners of war well." The Associated Press reporter had to admit: "Kennedy's experience, like the experiences of other Commonwealth prisoners of war in Prisoner of War Camp No. 5, seems to confirm the promise made by the communists when they captured them." The experience of American prisoner of war Chiginny shows that he was left unattended by the US military after being wounded on the battlefield, but the Korean and Chinese forces began treating him on the battlefield. After being repatriated, Chiginny was clearly unable to forget this humanitarian spirit of the Korean and Chinese side. According to United Press, although American reporters "tried their best to get Chiginny to talk about possible mistreatment," "he, like most of the prisoners of war interviewed, said that he was treated very well." Another American prisoner of war, Stank, said: "I received first aid on the battlefield and was admitted to the hospital in a day and a half. Considering the conditions at the time, the medical care was as thorough as they could possibly make it." There are too many facts to enumerate regarding the Korean and Chinese forces' rescue and lenient treatment of repatriated American prisoners of war on the battlefield. In the face of these many facts, Lodge's lies are immediately exposed.

This so-called "atrocity report" also repeats the long-bankrupt slander of the so-called "death march." This kind of slander has long lost its market, and even senior US military officers have denounced it as absurd. On April 25th of this year, Lieutenant General Henry Wells, Commander-in-Chief of the Commonwealth Forces stationed in Korea and Japan, had already sealed this "death march" ghost story. He said, "From our conversations with the repatriated prisoners of war, we are not aware of any death marches or any similar incidents of abuse." And the day before Wells made his statement, American prisoner of war Mandina, when talking about his twenty-eight months of captivity at a press conference in Tokyo, also said: "Whether on the long march to northwestern Korea, or in the prisoner of war camp, I have never seen any incidents of abuse of prisoners of war." British prisoner of war Sarlitz said it more clearly: "When we were first captured, we had to walk to the Yalu River. It was very easy. We walked twelve miles a day and rested every three days. Anyone who could not walk was transported by car." Such is the truth about the American so-called "death march."

Another old tune replayed in this so-called "atrocity report" is the slander that the Korean and Chinese side committed so-called "atrocities" in prisoner of war camps. Anyone who has seen the repatriated American prisoners of war at Panmunjom who are healthy and have rosy complexions, anyone who has seen photos of the repatriated prisoners of war, can immediately expose this lie. These prisoners of war praised the humane treatment they received from the Korean and Chinese side after being repatriated. British prisoner of war Karl said that during the thirty-two months he was a prisoner of war, he lived "a life of only entertainment and no work" in a prisoner of war camp in North Korea, which was "a comfortable life as a prisoner of war." Some American officials' remarks also had to admit the humane treatment of prisoners of war by the Korean and Chinese side. For example, Major Robert Hetherington, the chief medical officer of the Canadian medical team, said that to his knowledge, "Chinese doctors take good care of their prisoners of war," and "most of the prisoners of war look healthier than our soldiers here." When a group of British prisoners of war returned to England via Hong Kong on August 20, the British Army Headquarters News Agency released a message saying: "They are in excellent spirits, look very healthy, and are all tanned by the sun." Even former US Eighth Army Commander Van Fleet had to admit at a press conference in Philadelphia on April 23: "Before the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners of war, the Communists had released some Allied prisoners of war," "and none of them brought news of atrocities."

This so-called "atrocity report" also shamelessly slanders the Korean and Chinese People's Army with "killing" Korean civilians, which is even more absurd. Everyone knows that it is the American aggressors and their accomplices who ran from 14,000 miles away to Korea to massacre civilians on a large scale. These man-eating beasts committed thousands of atrocities on Korean soil. The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has repeatedly submitted reports to the United Nations regarding the atrocities of the US military. The "Report of the International Women's Investigation Team on the Atrocities of the US and Syngman Rhee Armies in Korea" alone lists countless bloody facts, pointing out that the US side "inhumanly exterminated Korean residents. In areas temporarily occupied by the US military and Syngman Rhee's army, hundreds of thousands of peaceful residents, from the elderly to infants, were subjected to torture, burning, beating to death, and being buried alive." The report also stated: "This large-scale massacre and torture exceeded the crimes committed by the Hitler Nazi bandits when they occupied Europe." And it pointed out: "All the evidence provided by peaceful residents in their conversations confirms that all these crimes were almost entirely carried out by American officers and soldiers, or under the orders of American officers." These atrocities of the American army have also long been confirmed by the investigation team of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers. The American side has never dared to deny the accusations made by the Korean government and international organizations.

The fact that the Korean and Chinese side treats prisoners of war humanely is already well known, and cannot be overturned by the empty slander of the US side. And the US's crimes of massacring and maltreating captured personnel of the Korean and Chinese side have long been notorious. The US's attempt to use its control of the United Nations to pass this slanderous proposal to divert the attention of the people of the world from the unprecedented atrocities committed by the US in Korea is completely futile. The so-called proposal for "serious concern" about the Korean and Chinese "atrocities" is as worthless as the stock of a bankrupt American company.

### 举世公认我方给战俘以人道待遇  美方所谓“暴行报告”的谎言不攻自破

    举世公认我方给战俘以人道待遇
    美方所谓“暴行报告”的谎言不攻自破
    【新华社五日讯】美国又一次开动它在联合国大会中的表决机器，通过它的诬蔑朝中方面所谓
  “暴行”的提案，目的之一是企图借此掩饰它自己三年来屠杀、虐待以及强迫扣留战俘和平民的滔天罪行。但是，美国这种“贼喊捉贼”的卑劣伎俩是骗不了任何人的。许多美方战俘在被遣返以后所承认的我方宽待战俘的无数事实，完全证明美方的所谓“暴行报告”只是一部“鬼话大全”。
    美国在其向第八届联合国大会提出的所谓“暴行报告”中，诬蔑朝中方面在战场上屠杀战俘。但是事实上，被遣返的美方战俘差不多都承认他们在战场上被俘时受到了良好的待遇。例如，英国战俘肯尼迪在遣返后向美联社记者说，朝中部队在俘获他时就告诉他：“我们不杀俘虏，我们优待俘虏。”美联社记者不得不承认：“肯尼迪的经历，像第五号战俘营的其他英联邦俘虏的经历一样，看来都证实了共军在俘掳他们时所许下的诺言。”美国战俘奇金尼的经历表明，他在战场上受伤后被美军丢下不管，但朝中部队却在战场上就开始给他治疗。奇金尼在被遣返后对于朝中方面这种人道主义的精神显然不能忘怀。据合众社报道说，虽然美国记者们
  “竭力要奇金尼谈论可能的虐待情况”，但是“他像大多数被访问的战俘所说的那样，说他所受的待遇很好”。另一个美国战俘斯坦克说：“我在战地得到急救，在一天半内就进了医院。就当时的条件而论，医疗照顾的周到是尽了他们最大的力量。”被遣返的美方战俘所叙述的朝中部队在战场上救护和宽待他们的事实，多得不胜枚举。在这许多事实面前，洛奇的谎言立刻就现出了原形。
    这个所谓“暴行报告”还重复早已破产的所谓“死亡行军”的谰言。这种谰言早已经失去了市场，甚至美方的高级军官都斥之为荒诞无稽。在今年的四月二十五日，驻朝鲜和日本的英联邦军总司令亨利·威尔斯中将就已经给这个“死亡行军”的鬼话贴上了封条。他说，“从我们和被遣返的战俘们谈话中看来，我们还不知道有任何死亡行军和任何相类似的虐待事件。”而在威尔斯发表谈话前一天，美国战俘曼迪纳在东京举行记者招待会上谈述他被俘二十八个月的情况时也说：“不论是在向朝鲜西北的长程行军中，或在战俘营中，我从来没有看到任何虐待战俘的事件。”英国战俘萨尔利兹说得更清楚：“当我们刚被俘的时候，我们必须要走到鸭绿江边。这是很容易的。我们每天走十二英里，每三天休息一天。凡是不能走的人都用车子运。”美国所谓“死亡行军”的真相，就是如此。
    这个所谓“暴行报告”重弹的另一支老调是诬蔑朝中方面在战俘营中有所谓“暴行”。任何一个在板门店见到过被遣返的身体健康、面色红润的美方战俘的人，任何一个见到过被遣返的战俘的照片的人，都立刻可以戳穿这个谎言。这些战俘在被遣返以后都称道朝中方面对他们的人道待遇。英国战俘卡尔说他在被俘的三十二个月期间，“在北朝鲜战俘营中所过的是只娱乐不工作的生活”，是“舒舒服服的战俘生活”。美方一些官方人士的谈话也不得不承认朝中方面对战俘的人道待遇。例如，加拿大医疗队主任医官罗伯特·赫瑟林顿少校说过，据他了解，“中国医生对他们的战俘照顾得很好”，“战俘当中大多数人看上去比我们这里的士兵还要健康”。当一批英国战俘在八月二十日经香港返英时，英军总部新闻署发表消息说：“他们精神极佳，看上去甚为健康，个个都被太阳晒得黑黝黝的。”甚至前美军第八军军长范佛里特四月二十三日在费城记者招待会上，也不得不承认：“在交换病伤俘以前共产党已释放过一些联军战俘，”“他们中间没有一个带来关于暴行的消息。”
    这个所谓“暴行报告”还无耻地诬蔑朝中人民军队“杀害”朝鲜平民，这更是荒乎其唐。谁都知道，从一万四千英里以外跑到朝鲜来大规模屠杀平民的，正是美国侵略者及其帮凶军。这些吃人野兽在朝鲜土地上制造了千百件惨案。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府曾经一再向联合国提出关于美军暴行的报告。单是“国际妇女对朝鲜美李军暴行调查团报告书”就列举了无数的血腥事实，指出美方“惨无人道地消灭朝鲜居民。在暂时遭到美军和李承晚军队侵占的地区，有数十万的和平居民，全家从老人到婴孩都遭受到拷打、烧死、打死、活埋。”报告书上还说：“这种大规模的屠杀和拷打，超过了希特勒纳粹匪徒占领欧洲时所犯的罪行。”并且指出：“所有和平居民在谈话中所提供的证据，都证实这一切罪行差不多全部是由美国官兵执行的，或是在美国军官命令之下执行的。”美国军队的这种暴行，也早已为国际民主法律工作者协会的调查团所证实。对于朝鲜政府和国际团体所提出的指责，美国方面从来不敢加以抵赖。
    朝中方面给战俘以人道待遇的事实，已经是尽人皆知，决非美方的空口诬蔑所能推翻。而美方屠杀虐待朝中被俘人员的罪行，却早已臭名远扬。美国企图以挟持联合国通过这个诬蔑性提案来转移全世界人民对美国在朝鲜犯下的史无前例的暴行的注视，是完全徒劳的。所谓“严重关怀”朝中“暴行”的提案，正像倒闭了的美国公司的股票一样一钱不值。
