The Jiangxi Provincial Department of Industry Instructs Subordinate Factories and Mines to Prepare for Production in the First Quarter of Next Year

The work of compiling and reporting the 1954 industrial production plan for factories and mines directly under the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Industry has been basically completed. In order to meet the upcoming production tasks, the Provincial Department of Industry issued instructions requiring all subordinate factories and mines to conscientiously prepare for production in the first quarter of next year.

The instructions point out: Based on the production situation in previous years, after a period of intense production in the fourth quarter of each year, factories and mines often experience a relaxation of morale and a decline in production in the first quarter of the following year, disrupting the balanced nature of annual production. In order to ensure and strive to overfulfill the 1954 production plan, it is necessary to promptly study and arrange production work for the first quarter of next year on the basis of ensuring the completion and overfulfillment of this year's production and increased production and economy plan.

At present, there is more or less a view in various factories and mines that completing this year's production and increased production and economy plan is in opposition to preparing for production in the first quarter of next year. For example, some enterprises postpone the overhaul of machinery and equipment that should be overhauled until next year in order to complete this year's production and increased production tasks; some have used up raw materials that should be stockpiled, or withdrawn semi-finished products needed for the next production cycle, and so on. The instructions require all factories to prepare for production in the first quarter of next year from the following aspects.

First, fully mobilize the masses and correctly formulate the production plan for the first quarter of next year. All factories and mines must check this year's comprehensive production work on the basis of carrying out the increased production and economy campaign, summarize experiences and lessons, and use them as a basis for studying and arranging the work for the first quarter of next year; at the same time, they must mobilize the masses to discuss and determine various production targets for the first quarter and formulate a production plan for the first quarter, so that the plan has a solid mass base.

Second, strengthen preparations before production. All factories and mines should, on the basis of formulating the production plan for the first quarter, immediately organize the supply of raw materials and conduct a thorough inventory cleanup to ascertain the stockpiling situation, so as to prevent the occurrence of work stoppages due to lack of materials. At the same time, it is necessary to prepare the necessary quantity of work-in-process and semi-finished products in accordance with the requirements of the production plan, and pay attention to preventing the exhaustion of work-in-process and semi-finished products needed for the next cycle due to rushing to increase production tasks, so as to cause interruption of production in the first quarter of next year. In terms of sales, all factories and mines should take the initiative to negotiate with the departments in need to avoid stagnation of products.

Third, on the basis of comprehensively summarizing this year's production work, further study and strengthen specific measures for planning management and implementing job plans. All factories and mines can formulate practical and feasible progress plans for promoting job plans according to different conditions and different requirements and in combination with specific circumstances; at the same time, they must also establish and improve some necessary technical management systems in a planned and step-by-step manner around the implementation of job plans in order to reduce the scrap rate and improve product quality.

Fourth, all factories and mines should do a good job in equipment maintenance and overhaul in accordance with the requirements of next year's production plan. Overhaul plans must be formulated and preventive repairs implemented in order to reduce equipment accidents. All production equipment that should be overhauled must be inspected once before the end of this year, and overhaul work must be organized during the annual leave and Spring Festival period to ensure safe production in the first quarter.

Fifth, before the end of the year, the scope of responsibilities of each section, office, workshop, and team must be clearly defined and the allocation of labor adjusted in accordance with the requirements of next year's production tasks.

    江西省工业厅指示所属厂矿
    做好明年第一季度生产准备工作
    江西省工业厅直属厂矿一九五四年工业生产计划的编报工作已基本完成。为了迎接即将到来的生产任务，省工业厅发出指示，要求所属各厂矿切实做好明年第一季度的生产准备工作。
    指示指出：根据历年来生产情况，各厂矿在每年第四季度紧张生产之后，到第二年的第一季度往往出现情绪松懈、生产下降现象，破坏了全年生产的均衡性。为了保证并争取超额完成一九五四年生产计划，就必须在保证完成与超额完成今年生产与增产节约计划的基础上，及时研究和布置明年第一季度的生产工作。
    目前，各厂矿中或多或少地存在着把完成今年的生产和增产节约计划与做好明年第一季度的生产准备工作相对立的看法。如有的企业为了完成今年的生产和增产任务，把应该检修的机器设备推迟到明年去检修；有的动用了应该储备的原材料，或提用了下一生产周期所需的半成品等等。指示要求各厂从下列几方面来做好明年第一季度的生产准备工作。
    第一，充分发动群众，正确地编制明年第一季度的生产计划。各厂矿必须在开展增产节约竞赛的基础上，检查今年全面生产工作，总结经验教训，作为研究布置明年第一季度工作的依据；同时要发动群众讨论并确定明年第一季度的各项生产指标，编制第一季度的生产计划，使计划具备深厚的群众基础。
    第二，加强生产前的准备工作。各厂矿应在编制第一季度生产计划的基础上，立即组织原材料的供应工作，并切实进行一次库存的清理工作，摸清储备情况，以防止停工待料现象的发生。同时，必须按照生产计划的要求，准备必要数量的在制品、半成品，注意防止由于赶增产任务而把下一周期所需要的在制品、半成品用光，以致造成明年第一季度生产的中断。在销售方面，各厂矿应主动与需要部门进行协商，以免使产品停滞。
    第三，在全面总结今年生产工作的基础上，进一步研究加强计划管理与贯彻作业计划的具体措施。各厂矿可根据不同条件和不同要求，结合具体情况，订出切实可行的推行作业计划的进度计划；同时，还必须围绕着贯彻作业计划，有计划有步骤地建立和健全一些必要的技术管理制度，以降低废品率，提高产品质量。
    第四，各厂矿应根据明年生产计划的要求，做好设备的维护与检修工作。必须订出检修计划，实行预防性修理，以期减少设备事故。凡是应该检修的生产设备，必须在今年年底以前，进行一次检查，并在年假及春节期内，组织检修工作，以保证第一季度的安全生产。
    第五，必须在年底以前，根据明年生产任务的要求，明确规定各科、室及车间、小组的职责范围，并调整劳动力调配。
