Reader's Letters Abstract

    Applying for Equipment is as Urgent as Fire
    Equipment is Approved, But Left to Accumulate
    Reader Song Wenyuan writes: In March of this year, the Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory (formerly the Universal Machinery Factory), with the approval of higher authorities, was allocated a batch of imported equipment worth 22.48 billion yuan. By July, the factory had only completed the procedures for picking up the goods from the supplier, but after completing the procedures, it delayed picking up and transporting the goods for a long time. In order to put this batch of equipment into production as soon as possible and avoid accidents (the equipment was stored in the open air), the supplier repeatedly sent letters urging them to pick up the goods, but the factory dragged its feet until September. Why did it take half a year from the approval of the equipment to its transportation? Is it because production doesn't need it? No. The factory once said in a letter to the supplier: This equipment is the key to whether the factory can complete its production tasks in the second half of this year and requested its approval as soon as possible. However, after it was approved and allocated by higher authorities, they delayed its pickup and transportation for half a year. This situation is common. For example, the Jinan No. 2 Machine Tool Factory only recently transported the machinery approved in March from Qinhuangdao. This equipment was left on the platform without any cover, exposed to wind, sun, and rain, and was not inspected after opening the boxes from import to transport. Another example is the equipment allocated to the Northeast Machinery No. 18 Factory, for which procedures have been completed for two months, but there is still no news of its transport. These units all said how urgently they needed the equipment when applying for it, but after it was approved, they have been delaying its pickup and transport, allowing national equipment to accumulate for a long time and unable to be put into production. This practice, at a time when the people of the whole country are working hard to increase production and practice economy and striving to accelerate the industrialization of the motherland, must not be allowed to happen again.

### 申请批拨器材时急如星火  器材批拨下来却听凭积压

专栏：读者来信摘要

    申请批拨器材时急如星火
    器材批拨下来却听凭积压
    读者宋文源来信：今年三月，上海汽轮机厂（原通用机器厂）经上级批准，拨进价值二十二亿四千八百多万元的一批进口器材。到七月份，该厂才向供货单位办理提货手续，但办完手续后又长期不来提运。为了使这批器材早日投入生产和避免发生意外（器材存放在露天地），供货单位曾屡次函催，但该厂一直拖到九月份才来提运。为什么这批器材从批拨到提运竟拖了半年之久，是生产不需要吗？不是的。该厂当初在给供货单位的信中曾说：这些器材是该厂今年下半年生产任务完成与否的关键所在，要求尽早批拨。但是在上级批准拨给后，他们却拖了半年才提运。这种情况很多。像济南第二机床厂也是在最近才将三月份批拨的机器由秦皇岛运走。这些器材放在站台上没有任何东西掩盖，任凭风吹、日晒和雨淋，从进口到提运，也未开箱检验。又如批拨给东北机械十八厂的器材，办理完手续已有两月，但仍无提运音讯。这些单位在申请要器材时都说是如何如何的急需，而批拨到了却一直不提运，任凭国家器材长期积压，不能投入生产。这种做法，在全国人民努力增产节约、为加速祖国工业化而斗争的时候，是决不能容许再发生了。
