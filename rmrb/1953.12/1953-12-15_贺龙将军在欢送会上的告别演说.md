Comrades and friends:

    The work of the Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea is coming to an end, and we are about to return to China. With deep reluctance, we bid farewell to you and, through you, to the heroic Korean people and the Korean People's Army. We express our heartfelt gratitude for your warm reception and welcome, and extend our highest respect to the respected leader of the Korean people, Marshal Kim Il Sung!

    In the past two months, under the warm care and assistance of the Korean Workers' Party, the government, and the respected leader of the Korean people, Marshal Kim Il Sung, our delegation has conducted widespread慰问work from Najin in the north to Kaesong in the south, from the west coast to the east coast. We met with cadres of the Korean Workers' Party and the government at the level of provinces, counties, and villages, with officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army, and with workers, farmers, women, students, and people from scientific, educational, and cultural circles in Korea, and with commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Wherever we went, we expressed the love and respect of the Chinese people and our great leader Chairman Mao Zedong for the heroic Korean people, reported on the situation of the Chinese people's resistance against U.S. aggression and aid to Korea and the achievements of economic construction, as well as the determination to continue to assist the Korean people. We successfully completed the glorious task entrusted to us by the Chinese people and further deepened the combat friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples.

    In the course of the慰问work, we have more deeply realized that "the word 'Korean' has become a symbol of the great and resolute national spirit." We have visited heroes in the People's Army, who displayed unparalleled bravery and ingenuity in the war against the American aggressors. In battle, heroic soldiers, holding high the banner of victory, charged towards the enemy's positions, some even blocking the enemy's gun ports with their chests, opening up the path for the capture of the enemy's positions. It is this revolutionary heroism that has made the Korean People's Army, under the leadership of the Workers' Party and Marshal Kim Il Sung, a strong fighting force.

    All the Korean people and the Korean People's Army we visited share a common will: on the one hand, to resolutely implement the armistice agreement, and on the other hand, to vigilantly defend against the enemy. On a front-line position, we saw a slogan: "First is vigilance, second is vigilance, third is vigilance!" On another front-line position, the soldiers, with a full fighting spirit, told the representatives of the delegation: "If the enemy dares to violate peace and launch another war, we will give them an even greater blow." During the慰问workin various places, we witnessed with our own eyes the Korean people actively restoring and developing the national economy with a strong spirit. We visited the Pyongyang Textile Factory, where the workers' productivity exceeded 12 percent before the war. We visited the Seongheung Mine, where the workers completed the 1953 restoration plan seventy-one days ahead of schedule. In the countryside, the farmers are also producing under difficult conditions, increasing grain production for the country.

    Everywhere we can see the masses repairing roads, building bridges, building new houses, and restoring towns and cities destroyed by the brutal enemy. Comrades, in the brutal war, the Korean people have been tempered and grown into a new force, which will inevitably have a significant impact on the recovery and development of the Korean people's economy. Let us take this opportunity to wish the Democratic People's Republic of Korea a victorious completion of the restoration and construction of the national economy.

    Everywhere we see the deep friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples. There are many heroes in the stretcher teams like Park Jae-geun, who rescued wounded soldiers of the Volunteer Army in the war. For example, Fang Xingfu's son was killed by a shell while covering wounded soldiers of the Volunteer Army. Fang Xingfu left his son's body unattended and continued to carry the wounded soldiers of the Volunteer Army to the hospital before burying his son. In the Battle of Shangganling, a Korean woman, Shi Jirong, helped the Volunteer Army and had her legs blown off. She crawled to the roadside to set up a tea station and continued to support the Volunteer Army. "Volunteer Army Mother" Li Shunren loved the Volunteer Army soldiers as if they were her own sons. Many Korean farmers entrusted their family affairs to the Volunteer Army soldiers when they went out to work. The Korean people get along with the Volunteer Army as if they were one family.

    The comrades of the Volunteer Army cherish the Korean people as if they were their own relatives. They save food to help Korean disaster victims and help the masses with production in the gaps between battles. Luo Shengjiao-style lofty internationalism was embodied by martyr Shi Yuanhou, who drowned in Anzhou while saving Korean child Zhao Yuanhong. There are many other similar touching events in the war. The combat friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples and their armies, as Vice Chairman Liu Zaiqing of North Pyongan Province said, is "higher than the Himalayas and longer than the Yangtze River." And this friendship has been further strengthened by the Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement signed between the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

    This agreement demonstrates the permanent unity between the Chinese and Korean peoples and also demonstrates a strong force of solidarity among the Asian peoples. This force is a serious warning to those international reactionary groups who attempt to reverse the wheels of history and continue to suppress the national independence movements of Asian nations. This agreement fully demonstrates the rock-solid unity of the entire peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union, which can never be undermined by any rumors, slanders, or instigations by the imperialists. Please allow me to warmly congratulate the signing of the Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement between China and Korea.

    In the past two months, everything we have encountered has left an indelible impression on us. The Korean people and the Korean and Chinese people's armies have made us feel infinitely close and have left us with a very deep impression. All our representatives, from their own personal experiences, have once again confirmed a conclusion: The Korean people and the Korean and Chinese people's armies are an invincible iron force. The fraternal unity between the peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union and the Chinese and Korean peoples is a strong force for defeating the enemy and defending peace in the Far East and the world. Anyone who does not accept this lesson will continue to suffer even more serious failures.

    Dear comrades, all the comrades of our delegation will convey all this in detail to the people of our motherland, encouraging them to engage in more heroic struggles under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, to fully carry out the construction of the motherland, to deepen the movement of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and to continue to strengthen the friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples.

    Goodbye! Dear comrades and friends, although we are about to leave you, our hearts are closely linked together. Facing the ferocious American imperialism, we must be vigilant, hold our positions, fight to crush the enemy's conspiracies and tricks, to thoroughly implement the Korean Armistice Agreement, for the victory of the cause of peaceful reunification of Korea, and to defend peace in the Far East and the world. In this great struggle, we must further strengthen unity, join hands, and advance bravely.

    Long live the victory of the Korean people's great war of resistance against aggression and defense of the country!
    Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples!
    Long live the friendly unity of the world peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union!
    Long live Marshal Kim Il Sung, the respected leader of the Korean people!
    Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!

### 贺龙将军在欢送会上的告别演说

    贺龙将军在欢送会上的告别演说亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团的慰问工作将要结束了，我们就要回到中国去。我们怀着依依难舍的心情，向你们告别，并通过你们向英雄的朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军告别，向你们盛情的招待和欢迎表示衷心的感谢，并向朝鲜人民敬爱的领袖金日成元帅致以崇高的敬意！
    近两个月来，我们慰问团在朝鲜劳动党、政府和朝鲜人民敬爱的领袖金日成元帅的热情关怀和协助下，北至罗津、南至开城、西至西海岸、东至东海岸，普遍地进行了慰问工作。我们与朝鲜道、郡、里以上劳动党和政府的干部见了面，与朝鲜人民军将士们见了面，与朝鲜的工人、农民、妇女、学生、科学教育界、文艺界见了面，与中国人民志愿军指挥员战斗员们见了面。我们每到一处，都表达了中国人民和我们伟大的领袖毛泽东主席对英雄的朝鲜人民的热爱和敬意，报告了中国人民抗美援朝的情况和经济建设的成就，以及继续援助朝鲜人民的决心，圆满地完成了中国人民给予我们的光荣任务，更进一步地加深了朝中两国人民的战斗友谊。
    在慰问工作中，使我们更深刻地体会到“朝鲜人这个字眼已成为伟大的刚毅的民族精神的象征”。我们访问过人民军中的英雄们，他们在反抗美国侵略者的战争中，发挥了无比的英勇和机智。在战斗中，英雄的战士们，高举着胜利的旗帜，冲向敌人的阵地，有的甚至以自己的胸膛堵塞敌人的枪眼，开辟了攻占敌人阵地的前进道路。就是这种革命英雄主义，使得在劳动党和金日成元帅领导下的朝鲜人民军，成为一支坚强的战斗力量。
    我们所有访问过的朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军，他们都有着一个共同的意志，就是一方面坚决执行停战协定，同时，也警惕地防御敌人。在一个前线阵地上，我们看到了一幅标语：“第一是警惕，第二是警惕，第三是警惕！”在另一个前沿阵地上，战士们以饱满的战斗精神，对慰问团代表说：“如果敌人胆敢破坏和平，再要发动战争，我们就要给以更大的打击”。在各地慰问时，我们亲眼看到朝鲜人民以坚强的精神积极地恢复和发展国民经济。我们访问过平壤纺织工厂，工人们的生产力就超过战前百分之十二。我们访问了成兴矿山，工人们提前七十一天完成一九五三年的恢复计划。在农村中，农民们也是一样的在艰苦条件下进行生产，为国家增产了粮食。
    我们到处可以看到群众在修路、修桥、盖新房，恢复被残暴的敌人所毁灭的城镇。同志们，在残酷的战争中，朝鲜人民已经锻炼和长成一股新的力量，这股力量必然对朝鲜人民经济的恢复与发展，发生重大的作用。让我们在此地预祝朝鲜民主主义人民共和国国民经济的恢复和建设的胜利完成。
    我们到处看到朝中两国人民的深厚友谊。在战争中为救护志愿军伤员朴在根式的担架队英雄们是不少的，如方兴福的儿子为掩护志愿军伤员被炮弹炸死，方兴福把自己儿子的尸体放下不顾，继续把志愿军的伤员抬往医院回来后才把自己儿子掩埋；在上甘岭战斗中，一位朝鲜妇女石吉荣帮助志愿军工作，腿被炸断，她就爬行到路旁设茶水站，继续支援志愿军；“志愿军妈妈”李顺任爱护志愿军战士，就像爱护自己的儿子一样。不少朝鲜农民出外办事，就把家里的事情托付给志愿军的战士来照管。朝鲜人民与志愿军相处得完全同一家人一样。
    志愿军的同志们，爱护朝鲜人民，也像爱护自己的亲人一样。他们节约粮食救济朝鲜灾民，在战斗空隙中帮助群众进行生产。罗盛教式的高度国际主义的体现者史元厚烈士，在安州为拯救朝鲜儿童赵元弘而溺水牺牲。其他在战争中类似这种动人的事例还很多。中朝两国人民及其军队的战斗友谊，正如平安北道柳在青副委员长说的：“比喜马拉雅山还高，比长江还长。”而这种友谊，由于中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国所签订的经济及文化合作协定，而更加增强起来了。
    这个协定表现了中朝两国人民之间的永久团结，也表现了亚洲人民之间的一种坚强团结的力量。这种力量对于那些妄图扭转历史车轮，继续镇压亚洲民族独立运动的国际反动集团是个严重的警告。这个协定充分证明了以苏联为首的整个和平民主阵营的坚如磐石的团结，这种团结绝不是帝国主义者的任何造谣中伤和挑拨离间所能破坏的。请允许我热烈地祝贺朝中两国经济及文化合作协定的签订。
    近两个月来，我们所遇到的一切，都给我们留下了不可磨灭的印象。朝鲜人民和朝、中人民军队都使我们感到无限的亲切，都使我们得到极深刻的印象。我们所有的代表，从自己亲身的体验中，再一次证实了一个结论：朝鲜人民和朝、中人民军队是永远不可战胜的钢铁力量，以苏联为首的和平民主阵营和朝中两国人民的兄弟般的团结，是战胜敌人和保卫远东和世界和平的坚强力量。谁要是不接受这个教训，谁就一定会继续遭到更严重的失败。
    亲爱的同志们，我们慰问团全体同志，将把这一切详尽地传达给我们祖国的人民，鼓舞他们在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，为全力进行祖国的建设、深入开展抗美援朝运动、继续加强朝中人民友谊而进行更英勇的斗争。
    再见吧！亲爱的同志们，朋友们，我们虽然就要离开你们，但我们的心是紧紧地连在一起的。我们面对着凶恶的美帝国主义，我们要提高警惕，严守阵地，为粉碎敌人的阴谋诡计，为朝鲜停战协定的彻底实现，为朝鲜的和平统一事业的胜利，为保卫远东和世界的和平而斗争。在这个伟大的斗争中，我们要进一步加强团结，携手并肩，奋勇前进。
    朝鲜人民伟大的反侵略卫国战争胜利万岁！
    朝中人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营友好团结万岁！
    朝鲜人民敬爱的领袖金日成元帅万岁！
    中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
