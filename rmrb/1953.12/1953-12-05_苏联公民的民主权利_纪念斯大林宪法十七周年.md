    The Democratic Rights of Soviet Citizens
    ——Commemorating the Seventeenth Anniversary of the Stalin Constitution
    Soviet Union Fu. Sawadsky

    Soviet socialist democracy differs from bourgeois democracy in that it is democracy for the whole people. Its political foundation is the Soviet of Workers' Representatives, and its economic foundation is the socialist economic system and the socialist ownership of the means of production.
    Soviet democracy grants the Soviet working people enormous rights, guaranteeing their broadest and most active participation in all aspects of economic, state, cultural, social, and political life. These rights were enshrined in law in the Soviet Constitution, which was adopted in December 1936 after nationwide discussion. The Soviet Constitution—the constitution of victorious socialism—not only proclaims the rights of the working people, but also guarantees that these rights are truly realized.
    The right to work is one of the most important basic rights of Soviet citizens. The state guarantees that all citizens have work and are remunerated according to the quantity and quality of their work.
    In the Soviet Union, the number of workers and staff is growing year after year. At the end of 1952, the number of employees was 10.02 million more than before the war. The Soviet Union consistently implements the socialist principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work." Whoever works more, better, and more effectively receives more remuneration. In the Soviet Union, labor is an honor. The Soviet state rewards working people in every way, awarding them orders and medals, and conferring on them the lofty title of Hero of Socialist Labor. Every worker in the Soviet state has every opportunity to improve his skills.
    In capitalist countries, such a situation as we have cannot and will not exist. In those countries, unemployment is increasing year by year, and the poverty of urban and rural laborers is deepening. For example, in the six major capitalist countries of the United States, Britain, France, Italy, West Germany, and Japan, there were 32 million fully and partially unemployed people in 1952.
    Soviet citizens have the right to rest. This right is a sign of the great concern of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government for the people. The purpose of giving Soviet laborers rest is to protect their health and maintain their labor force, and to ensure their active participation in social and political life, and to improve their political thinking and cultural level.
    The right of Soviet workers to rest is legally guaranteed by: the working hours for workers and staff are stipulated as eight hours per working day, and the working hours for those engaged in occupations with difficult working conditions are reduced to seven to six hours. This right is also guaranteed by: the provision of paid annual leave for workers and staff. For the same purpose, sanatoriums, rest homes, clubs, cultural palaces, libraries, reading rooms, sports grounds, parks, and gardens have been widely established.
    The Soviet Union has 390 resort areas, 2,500 sanatoriums, and thousands of rest homes. This year, approximately five million people are recuperating and receiving treatment in sanatoriums throughout the country.
    Under capitalism, the system of exploitation torments people and causes them to lose their ability to work prematurely. Not only is there no limit to the working day in colonial countries; even in the United States, a large proportion of workers have no limit to their working day: there are more than 3.2 million laborers who work nine to eleven hours a day, and 1.5 million who work twelve to fifteen hours or more than fifteen hours a day.
    In the United States, labor protection is practically non-existent. In the U.S. coal mining industry alone, approximately 1.3 million miners have died or been disabled in the past 20 years. Workers in capitalist countries lose their jobs when they become old or lose their ability to work, because their labor cannot bring the capitalists the profits they seek. The peasants of bourgeois countries have been living in a state of constant worry about their future. Millions of peasants have gone bankrupt.
    The socialist state cares for its citizens not only when they are able to work; according to the Constitution, Soviet citizens also have the right to material security in old age, illness, and loss of ability to work. This right is guaranteed by: the state funding social insurance for workers and staff, providing free medical care for laborers, and widely establishing sanatoriums for laborers to enjoy. According to the articles of association of agricultural labor cooperatives, each collective farm has its own public mutual aid fund, part of which is used as subsidies for elderly, disabled, and sick members of the cooperative.
    Every Soviet citizen has the right to education, that is, the right to improve their cultural level and acquire specialized knowledge in various types of schools.
    All schools, including institutions of higher learning, are open to the working people. The Soviet schools educate young people in the communist spirit, arming students with various kinds of knowledge, and promoting their ideas of Soviet patriotism, respect for labor, and fraternal mutual assistance. Illiteracy has long been eradicated throughout the country, including the most remote and previously backward border areas, and universal, free seven-year compulsory education has been implemented. At present, the Soviet Union is transitioning to universal, compulsory ten-year secondary education and comprehensive technical education.
    Now, 57 million people are studying in the Soviet Union, of which 1.5 million are in institutions of higher learning. Soviet cultural and educational facilities, whether in terms of the number of people receiving vocational education and higher education, the scale of correspondence schools, the training of scientific cadres and teachers, the scale of the network of libraries, clubs and theaters, and mass sports organizations and amateur theatrical groups, far exceed those of many large capitalist countries.
    Soviet science and culture are filled with the ideas of communism, peace, and brotherly friendship between all nations. In contrast, the ruling classes of capitalist countries cultivate bourgeois nationalism, racism, and conduct a frantic propaganda of hatred of mankind. Due to the evils of monopoly capitalists, hundreds of millions of people in capitalist countries live a life of ignorance. Among American adults, 3 million have never attended school, and 10 million are still semi-literate.
    True equality between men and women will not exist in any bourgeois country. In bourgeois countries, it is more difficult for women to find work, and it is also more difficult to receive education and improve their skills. Women who do the same work as men receive much lower wages.
    In the Soviet Union, women enjoy equal rights with men in all aspects of economic, cultural, and socio-political life. Women have the right to equal access with men to employment, remuneration, rest, social insurance, and education. Soviet women are active fighters for communist society.
    One of the fundamental characteristics of the Soviet Constitution lies in its internationalism. The equality of Soviet citizens regardless of nationality or race is an unshakeable law. This equality is guaranteed by the material conditions of the lives of the various nationalities of the Soviet Union. The Soviet regime is concerned with the further upsurge of the national economy, the material welfare of the people, and the cultural level of the Soviet republics.
    In the Soviet Union, any restriction or granting of privileges to citizens on the basis of national or racial relations, as well as the propagation of racial or national superiority, hatred, or contempt, shall be punished by law.
    The situation is completely different in capitalist countries. In capitalist countries, some nationalities enjoy privileges, while the rights of other nationalities are subject to various restrictions.
    Fifteen million American blacks suffer cruel oppression and humiliation. The "colored" races of the Union of South Africa, that is, the main residents of this country, are in reality unprotected by the law.
    The Soviet Constitution also guarantees Soviet citizens the following political freedoms: freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, freedom of street processions and demonstrations. The guarantee of these freedoms is: printing presses, paper, newspapers, publications, radio stations, public buildings, and other material conditions are available for the enjoyment of the working people.
    Although many bourgeois constitutions also verbally recognize the political freedoms of citizens, the freedom of bourgeois countries is the freedom of those rich people who get rich by the labor of workers and peasants and the freedom of the laboring people to die of starvation.
    The Soviet regime has created all the conditions for developing the initiative and political activeness of the masses. The Soviet Constitution guarantees all citizens the right to combine in various social organizations, such as trade unions, cooperatives, youth groups, sports and defense organizations, cultural, technical, and scientific groups, etc.
    The Soviet state guarantees all citizens the inviolability of their person and freedom of residence and secrecy of correspondence.
    In order to guarantee freedom of conscience, in the Soviet Union, politics and religion are separated, and education and religion are separated. The Church does not participate in state affairs, and the state does not interfere in church work, while treating all religions in the same way. All citizens are free to perform religious rituals or carry out anti-religious propaganda.
    In the Soviet Union, all state power organs, from the village Soviets to the Supreme Soviet, are elected by voters through universal, equal, direct suffrage by secret ballot. Soviet citizens have the right to participate in the elections of the Soviets, and can also be elected as representatives, regardless of race and nationality, regardless of sex, regardless of belief, regardless of education level, regardless of residency period, regardless of social origin, property status, and past activities.
    Such are the great democratic rights of the Soviet people. But every Soviet citizen also has certain obligations to his country and people. These obligations are in line with the vital interests of the people.
    The main obligations of Soviet citizens are: to abide by the Soviet Constitution, to implement Soviet laws, to observe labor discipline, to faithfully fulfill social obligations, to respect the rules of socialist public life, and to protect and consolidate socialist public property.
    Service in the Soviet army is an honorable obligation of Soviet citizens, and defending the motherland is the sacred duty of every Soviet citizen. Betrayal of the motherland is the greatest crime and should be punished most severely by law.
    The Soviet Constitution is the most democratic constitution in the world. The people's democratic countries have formulated their own constitutions in accordance with the model of the Soviet Constitution. These countries have declared to their citizens, and have materially guaranteed, many of the freedoms and rights that the Soviet people have long enjoyed.

    苏联公民的民主权利
    ——纪念斯大林宪法十七周年
    苏联  伏·萨瓦德斯基
    苏维埃社会主义的民主不同于资产阶级的民主，它是全民的民主。它的政治基础是劳动者代表苏维埃，它的经济基础是社会主义经济体系及社会主义生产工具与生产资料所有制。
    苏维埃民主赋予苏联劳动者以巨大的权利，保证他们最广泛地、最积极地参加到经济生活、国家生活、文化生活、社会及政治生活的各个方面。这些权利，在经全民讨论后于一九三六年十二月通过的苏联宪法中，以立法形式固定下来了。苏联宪法——胜利了的社会主义的宪法——不但宣布了劳动者的权利，并且保障这些权利得以真正实现。
    劳动权是苏联公民最重要的基本权利之一。国家保障全体公民都有工作，按其工作的数量和质量给予报酬。
    在苏联，工人和职员的数量年复一年地增长着。一九五二年底的职工人数较战前增加了一千零二十万。苏联一贯执行着“各尽所能，按劳取酬”的社会主义原则。谁工作得愈多、愈好、愈有成效，谁就获得更多的劳动报酬。在苏联，劳动是一种荣誉。苏维埃国家用一切方法奖励劳动的人，奖给他们勋章和奖章，授予他们社会主义劳动英雄的崇高称号。苏维埃国家的每个劳动者有一切可能来提高自己的技能。
    在资本主义各国没有也不可能有像我国所有的那种情况。在那些国家里，失业者逐年增加，城乡劳动者的贫困日益加深。例如，在美国、英国、法国、意大利、西德和日本六个主要资本主义国家内，全失业和半失业的人在一九五二年有三千二百万。
    苏联公民有休息权。这一权利是苏联共产党和苏联政府对人民的极大关怀的标志。给苏联劳动者以休息的目的，是为了保护他们的健康和保持他们的劳动精力，保证他们积极参加社会及政治生活，提高他们的政治思想和文化水平。
    苏联劳动者的休息权在法律上的保证是：工人和职员每个工作日的工作时间规定为八小时，从事劳动条件困难的职业者的工作时间缩减为七小时至六小时。此项权利的保证还有：规定工人和职员每年有照支原薪的休假。为了同样的目的，广泛设立了疗养所、休养所、俱乐部、文化宫、图书馆、阅览室、运动场、公园和花园等。
    苏联有三百九十个疗养区，二千五百个疗养所和几千个休养所。今年约有五百万人在全国各个疗养所休养和受到治疗。
    在资本主义条件下，剥削制度折磨着人们，并使他们过早地丧失了劳动能力。不仅在殖民地国家工作日没有任何的限制；就是在美国，很大一部分工人的工作日也是没有限制的：每天工作九至十一小时的劳动者有三百二十万人以上，每天工作十二至十五小时及十五小时以上的有一百五十万人。
    在美国，劳动保护实际上等于没有。仅在美国煤矿业这一个工业部门中，近二十年来就有一百三十万左右的矿工死亡或残废。资本主义各国的劳动者一到年老或丧失劳动能力时就失去了工作，因为他们的劳动不能给资本家带来他们所追求的那么多的利润。资产阶级国家的农民一直在为自己的未来而担心的情况中过活着。千百万农民破产了。
    社会主义国家对自己的公民不仅当他们有劳动能力时给予关怀；根据宪法规定，苏联公民在年老、患病及丧失劳动能力时，也有享受物质保证的权利。此项权利的保证是：国家出资为工人和职员举办社会保险事业，对劳动者实行免费医疗，广泛设立疗养所供劳动者享用。按照农业劳动组合章程，每个集体农庄有自己的公用互助基金，其中一部分作为津贴年迈、残废和患病的庄员的资金。
    每个苏维埃公民有受教育的权利，即在各类学校中提高自己的文化水平和求得专门知识的权利。
    所有的学校，包括高等学校在内，都为劳动者敞开着大门。苏联的学校以共产主义精神教育青年人，以各种知识武装学生，发扬他们的苏维埃爱国主义、尊重劳动、友爱互助的思想。在全国，包括最远的先前还很落后的边区在内，早已肃清了文盲，实施了普及的、免费的七年制义务教育。目前苏联正过渡向普及的、义务的十年制中等教育和综合技术教育。
    现在，苏联有五千七百万人在学习，其中有一百五十万人是在高等学校。苏联的文化教育设施，无论在受职业教育和高等教育的人数方面，在函授学校的规模方面，在培养科学干部和师资方面，图书馆、俱乐部和剧院网的规模以及群众性的运动团体和业余剧团等方面，都远远地超过了许多大的资本主义国家。
    苏联的科学和文化充满了共产主义、和平与各民族之间兄弟般友爱的思想。相反，资本主义国家的统治阶级却培植着资产阶级的民族主义、种族主义，进行着疯狂的人类仇恨的宣传。由于垄断资本家的罪恶，各资本主义国家的亿万人民过着一种愚昧无知的生活。美国成年人中，有三百万人从来就没有在学校里读过书，一千万人仍然是半文盲。
    男女的真正平等无论在那一个资产阶级国家里都不会有的。在资产阶级国家里，妇女找工作是更为困难的，受教育和提高技能也同样是更困难的。和男子做同样的工作的妇女，所得到的工资却少得多。
    在苏联，妇女在经济、文化和社会政治生活各方面均享有与男子平等的权利。妇女有与男子平等获得工作、劳动报酬、休息、社会保险及享受教育的权利。苏联的妇女是共产主义社会的积极战士。
    苏联宪法的基本特点之一就在于它的国际主义。苏联公民不分民族及种族的一律平等，是确定不移的法律。这种一律平等是以苏联各民族生活的物质条件来保证的。苏维埃政权关心着苏联各共和国的国民经济、人民的物质福利和文化水平的进一步高涨。
    在苏联，凡因民族或种族关系而对公民权利作任何限制或赋予特权，以及宣传种族或民族优越、仇恨或轻蔑的行为，均要受到法律的惩罚。
    在各资本主义国家里的情况则完全不同。在资本主义国家里，一部分民族享有特权，而另一部分民族的权利却受到各种限制。
    一千五百万美国黑人遭受着残酷的压迫和屈辱。南非联邦的“有色”种族，即这个国家的主要居民—实际上是得不到法律的保护的。
    苏联宪法也保障苏联公民享有下列各项政治自由：言论自由、出版自由、集会自由、游行及示威自由。这些自由的保证就是：印刷所、纸张、报纸、出版物、广播电台、公共建筑和其他物质条件，均供劳动者享用。
    虽然许多资产阶级的宪法在口头上也承认公民的政治自由，但是资产阶级国家的自由，就是那些靠工人和农民的劳动而发财的富翁们的自由和劳动人民死于饥饿的自由。
    苏维埃政权为发展人民群众的主动性和政治积极性创造了一切条件。苏联宪法保证所有公民有权结合于各种社会团体之内，如职工会、合作社、青年团体、体育及国防组织、文化技术及科学团体等。
    苏维埃国家保证全体公民有身体不受侵犯，居住和通讯秘密的自由。
    为保证信仰自由，在苏联实行政治与宗教分离及教育与宗教分离。教会不参与国政，国家不干涉教会工作，同时以同样态度对待一切宗教。一切公民皆能自由举行宗教仪式或进行反宗教宣传。
    在苏联，一切国家政权机关，从村苏维埃到最高苏维埃，均由选民按普遍、平等、直接选举法用不记名投票方式选举的。苏联公民有权参加苏维埃的选举，同样也可以被选为代表，并不分种族及民族，不分性别，不分信仰，不分教育程度，不问居住期限，不问社会出身、财产状况以及过去活动如何。
    苏维埃人的伟大的民主权利就是这样。但是每
  一个苏联公民对于自己的国家和人民也有一定的义务。这些义务是符合人民的切身利益的。
    苏联公民的主要义务就是：遵守苏联宪法，执行苏联法律，遵守劳动纪律，忠诚履行社会义务，尊重社会主义的公共生活的规则，保护和巩固社会主义的公有财产。
    在苏联军队中服役乃是苏联公民的光荣义务，而保卫祖国是每个苏联公民的神圣职责。背叛祖国是最大的罪恶，应受法律最严厉的惩罚。
    苏联宪法是世界上最民主的宪法。各人民民主国家按照苏联宪法这一典范制定了自己的宪法。这些国家向自己的公民宣布了，并在物质上保证了许多项为苏联人民所早已享有的自由和权利。
