Fragrant osmanthus blooms everywhere in September,
Osmanthus trees beside a three-room house,
In the past, landlords lived in that house,
Now lives the poor peasant, Auntie Li.
Auntie Li's face is full of smiles,
Carefully examining a photograph.
Gui'er has been in the army for three whole years,
Grown up looking different from before:
Originally a short and thin little kid,
Now tall and strong;
Patched clothes have become a new military uniform,
With a rifle across his chest.
The more Auntie Li thinks about it, the happier she gets,
Yesterday's events return to her heart.
Yesterday, the village chief brought a letter to Auntie Li,
Inside the letter was also this photograph.
Coincidentally, the girls came to visit,
Seeing the photograph, they all eagerly grabbed it.
Yinhua said: "Li Gui is my cousin,
I should be the first to see his picture."
Xiaolan pouted upon hearing this:
"This photograph should be seen by me first,
At home, he was the leader of my youth league group."
Squeaking and squawking unable to make things clear,
Auntie Li smilingly spoke up:
"Girls, don't argue about who goes first,
I'll hold it so you can all look together."
The girls looked at Li Gui's picture,
Each and every one with their mouths wide open.
Yinhua said:
"Three years without seeing his face,
He's grown so smart and handsome!"
Xiaolan said: "I like his pair of dark eyes,
And I also like that rifle of his!"
Lingling said: "Look at the badges on his chest, so pretty,
I seem to hear them jingle and jangle!"
Zhenzhen said: "Look how neatly the small words are written on the back,
Just like a teacher's handwriting!"
Auntie Li laughed so hard she bent over,
Tears dripping onto her clothes:
"Girls, aren't you ashamed,
Evaluating a young man in front of his mother.
I'll go ask a matchmaker right now,
You all quickly go back and prepare your dowries!"
The girls blushed upon hearing this,
Only Xiaolan refused to yield:
"He's Yinhua's cousin,
I think Yinhua should be the bride."
Yinhua said: "I'll use fire tongs to pinch your mouth shut,
Let's see if you still talk nonsense!
Cousins marrying each other is an old custom,
Now it's not those old times anymore.
As I see it, Lingling and he would make a good pair,
Their ages and temperaments are well-matched."
Lingling winked upon hearing this,
Pulling Zhenzhen to her side:
"Birds in the sky fly wing to wing,
You're most suited to be with Li Gui:
Li Gui is a hero,
Guarding the border day and night;
You're our village's production model,
Able to harvest twice as much grain from the same land.
A hero matched with a female model worker,
I guarantee it, glory upon glory!"
Zhenzhen was too shy to speak,
Feeling somewhat happy and somewhat flustered.
Auntie Li said: "Girls, you've studied the Marriage Law for nothing,
Still have old ideas in your heads!
This is my son's lifelong matter,
How can this old mother make the decision for him?
As I see it, you're all good daughters-in-law,
Each and every one of you is clever and skilled in everything.
Good, after Gui'er completes his mission and returns home,
I'll slowly discuss it with him!"...
The more Auntie Li thought about it, the happier she became,
Stepping out of the house:
"I'll go find someone to write a letter,
There's a sentence I want Gui'er to keep in mind:
Be sure to put in all your effort to achieve more merit,
To protect our motherland so it becomes increasingly prosperous."

    姑娘们的心事
    何念钧　乔林九月桂花遍地香，桂花树边三间房，房子里过去住地主哟，现在住的是贫农李大娘。李大娘脸上堆着笑，捧着像片细打量。桂儿参军三年整，长得和往日不一样：原来又矮又瘦的小娃儿，如今身高体又壮；补钉衣变成了新军服，胸前还横着冲锋枪。李大娘越想越有味，昨天的事又回到心坎上。昨天村长给大娘带回了一封信，信里面还夹着这张像。正好闺女们来串门，见了像片一股劲抢。银花说： “李桂是我的表哥哥，该让我先看他的像。”小兰一听噘噘嘴：
  “这像片应让我先看，他在家是我的团小组长。”吱吱哇哇闹不清，李大娘笑着开了腔： “闺女们莫要争先后，我拿着你们一起望。”闺女们看了李桂的像，一个个嘴巴都合不上。银花说：
  “三年不见他的面，长得精灵又漂亮！”小兰说： “我喜欢他那一对黑眼睛，还喜欢他那支冲锋枪！”玲玲说： “你看他胸前的奖章多好看，我好像听见它在叮噹响！”珍珍说： “你们看背后的小字写的多清秀，真像教员写的一个样！”李大娘笑得弯了腰，泪花儿滴在衣裳上：“丫头你们不害臊，当着妈妈评儿郎。我这会就去请媒人，你们快回去整嫁妆！”闺女们一听羞红了脸，独有小兰不肯让： “人家是银花的表哥哥，我看这新娘该银花当。”银花说： “我用火钳夹住你的嘴，看你乱讲不乱讲！表兄妹成亲是旧风俗，如今可不是那老时光。依我看哪，玲玲和他才是一对，他俩年龄性情都相当。”玲玲一听挤了挤眼，把珍珍拉在她身旁：
  “天上的鸟儿并翅飞，你配李桂最相当：李桂是个英雄汉，日夜守卫在边疆；你是咱村的生产模范，一样的田地能打两倍的粮。英雄配上女模范，我担保呀，光荣上面加荣光！”珍珍羞得说不出话，有几分儿高兴有几分儿慌。大娘说： “丫头们，亏你们学了婚姻法，脑袋里还有旧思想！这是我儿终身事，我老娘哪能替他作主张。依我看你们都是好媳妇，一个个都是心灵口巧样样强。好哇，等桂儿完成任务回家后，我慢慢跟他来商量！”……李大娘越想越欢喜，迈动步子出了房： “我去找人写一封信，有句话要桂儿记心上：一定要豁出力量多立功，保卫咱们祖国越来越富强。”
