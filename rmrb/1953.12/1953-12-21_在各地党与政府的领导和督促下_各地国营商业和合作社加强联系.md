Xinhua News Agency, December 20th: Under the urging of Party committees and governments in various regions, business relations between state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperative commerce have become increasingly close, providing a strong guarantee for the supply of materials to the vast countryside.

During the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, state-owned commercial departments in East China paid attention to correcting the shortcomings of insufficient coordination with cooperatives in the past. They universally held meetings with cooperatives and signed new supply and marketing contracts. Since October, the state-owned department store system in Northeast China has universally implemented the business policy of "actively relying on cooperatives and fully supplying the needs of the people." State-owned commercial enterprises and cooperatives in Yushu County, Jilin Province, Ning'an County, Songjiang Province, Linjiang County, Liaodong Province, Anda County, Heilongjiang Province, Tai'an County, Liaoxi Province, as well as Deng County, Henan Province, Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, and Jiashan County, Anhui Province, all held meetings to review past shortcomings in mutual assistance. After correcting ideological understanding, state-owned commercial enterprises in various regions adopted methods such as sending product catalogs and samples to cooperatives, establishing product communication networks within cooperatives, jointly holding product exhibitions with cooperatives, and inviting cooperatives to visit warehouses to strengthen mutual contact.

In the past, many cadres in state-owned commercial departments, due to insufficient clarity about the idea of relying on cooperatives, even believed that selling goods to cooperatives would affect the completion of their own business. The phenomena of inappropriately emphasizing that cooperatives should act according to plan, not earnestly implementing preferential rates, and not actively contacting them were common. In July, the Ya'an wholesale store of the Xikang Provincial Department Store Company sold only 6.3% of its total sales to cooperatives; only one or two county cooperative federations regularly dealt with this wholesale store. The cooperative side also lacked a clear understanding of how to become an assistant to state-owned commerce. Some cooperatives did not have a full range of goods and did not actively purchase goods from state-owned commercial enterprises, which affected their leadership in the market.

Since state-owned commercial enterprises strengthened their ties with cooperatives, the abnormal phenomena on both sides have been corrected. Many cooperative cadres have reported that state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperatives are like one family. State-owned commercial enterprises have also deeply realized the assistant role of cooperatives in the supply of materials. Taking the Linfen Special District of Shanxi as an example, there are only four local state-owned company agencies, but there are 250 cooperative units. Because the grassroots organizations of cooperatives are spread throughout the vast countryside, they are an important force for state-owned commercial enterprises to organize industrial products to go to the countryside.

Recently, the supply of materials from state-owned commercial enterprises to cooperatives has increased significantly. In October, the total value of materials supplied to cooperatives by state-owned department store units in Jiangsu increased by 26% compared with September. Under the specific help and leadership of state-owned commercial enterprises, the business of cooperatives in various regions has expanded more than before. In November, the business volume of cooperative federations in Sichuan Province exceeded 20% of that in October; the commodities of each grassroots cooperative in Jingzhou and Huanggang Special Districts of Hubei Province increased from more than 100 kinds in the past to more than 500 kinds.

After state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperatives established close ties, they greatly strengthened the supply of materials to the vast countryside. Since October, state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperatives in major regions have transported a large number of winter supplies to the countryside. The Chongqing Purchasing and Supply Station of the China Department Store Company transported about 8,000 tons of goods to rural areas every month in the fourth quarter, and a large number of towels and bed felt have been supplied to meet the needs of the countryside. In order to closely coordinate with the task of purchasing grain and animal products, the Suiyuan Provincial Company of the China Department Store Company successively dispatched more than 20 sales teams in early November, penetrating into rural areas and grasslands, closely combining with local cooperatives, and promoting a large number of industrial products. In the third quarter, the total amount of cloth supplied by state-owned commercial enterprises across the country increased by 31.71% compared with the same period last year, salt increased by 5.27%, and matches increased by 11.12%. Most of these materials are supplied to the countryside through cooperatives.

Strengthening the leadership and help of state-owned commercial enterprises to cooperatives can not only make industrial products flow to the countryside, but also enable cooperatives to free up their hands to strengthen the supply of means of production. In order to meet the needs of farmers' production this winter and next spring, cooperative federations in various parts of Sichuan have prepared more than 15,000 tons of chemical fertilizers, which are being transported from Chongqing and Chengdu to grassroots cooperatives. Various iron, wood, and bamboo agricultural tools produced and processed locally by grassroots cooperatives have begun to be supplied. In the third quarter, supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in Shanxi Province supplied farmers with more than 24 million catties of fertilizer, 2,626 pieces of agricultural implements, 2,164 waterwheels, 2,630 pieces of agricultural machinery, and more than 300,000 catties of pesticides. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Henan Province have universally expanded the purchase and supply plans for means of production. The means of production operated by cooperatives in the three special districts of Xinyang, Xuchang, and Luoyang this winter increased by 117% compared with the original plan. The Suiyuan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative plans to supply more than 47,000 pieces of various agricultural implements and more than 3,000 livestock. Cattle, horses and other livestock have now been transferred from the grasslands of Ulanqab League and Ikezhao League in Suiyuan Province to agricultural areas.

### 在各地党与政府的领导和督促下  各地国营商业和合作社加强联系

    在各地党与政府的领导和督促下
    各地国营商业和合作社加强联系
    【新华社二十日讯】各地国营商业和合作社商业在各地党和政府的督促下，双方业务关系已日益密切，为广大农村物资供应提供了有力保证。
    华东各地国营商业部门在增产节约运动中，就注意纠正了过去和合作社关系不够协调的缺点，普遍和合作社举行会议，订立了新的供销合同。东北国营百货系统从十月份开始普遍贯彻了“积极依靠合作社，充分供应人民需要”的业务方针。吉林省榆树县、松江省宁安县、辽东省临江县、黑龙江省安达县、辽西省台安县以及河南省邓县、浙江省宁波、安徽省嘉山县等地的国营商业和合作社都举行了会议，检讨过去互相帮助不够的缺点。在端正思想认识以后，各地国营商业并采用送商品目录、送商品样本给合作社，或在合作社里建立商品通讯网，与合作社联合举行商品展览会，邀请合作社参观仓库等办法加强彼此间的联系。
    过去不少国营商业部门的干部，由于对依靠合作社的思想不够明确，有的甚至认为卖给合作社商品会影响本身业务的完成。对合作社不适当地强调要按计划行事，不认真执行优待率和不主动联系的现象普遍存在。西康省百货公司雅安批发商店在七月份销给合作社的货物只占销售总额的百分之六点三；经常与这个批发商店往来的只有一两个县的县合作社联合社。合作社方面对如何成为国营商业的助手观念也不明确。有的合作社货色不全，也不主动向国营商业进货，影响对市场的领导。
    自国营商业加强了与合作社联系后，双方不正常的现象已得到纠正。很多合作社干部反映，国营商业和合作社像一家人一样了。国营商业在物资供应中也深切体会到合作社的助手作用。以山西临汾专区为例，当地国营公司机构只有四个，而合作社单位就有二百五十个。由于合作社基层机构遍及广大农村，是国营商业组织工业品下乡的重要力量。
    最近各地国营商业供应合作社的物资已显著增加。江苏国营百货单位十月份供应合作社的物资总值比九月份增加百分之二十六。各地合作社在国营商业具体帮助领导下，业务都较前扩大。四川全省合作社联合社在十一月份的营业额超过十月份的百分之二十；湖北荆州、黄冈专区各基层合作社的商品由过去一百多种增加到五百多种。
    国营商业和合作社建立了密切联系后，大大加强了对广大农村的物资供应。十月份以来，各大区的国营商业和合作社已将大批冬季用品源源运往农村。中国百货公司重庆采购供应站第四季度每月约有八千吨货物运到各地农村，大批毛巾、床毡已供应了农村的需要。中国百货公司绥远省公司为了密切配合粮食及畜产品收购任务，在十一月上旬连续派出了二十多个推销小组，深入农村、草原，紧密结合当地合作社，推销了大量工业品。全国国营商业在第三季度供应布的总额比去年同期增加百分之三十一点七一，盐增加百分之五点二七，火柴增加百分之十一点一二。这些物资大部通过合作社供应到农村去。
    国营商业加强对合作社的领导和帮助，不但可使工业品源源供应农村，而且可使合作社腾出手来加强生产资料的供应。四川各地合作社联合社为适应农民今冬明春生产的需要，准备了一万五千余吨化学肥料，正从重庆、成都两地分别运往农村基层社。各基层社就地取材、就地加工的各种铁、木、竹制农具已开始供应。山西省各级供销合作社在第三季度供应到农民手里的肥料达二千四百多万斤、农具二千六百二十六件、水车二千一百六十四部、农械二千六百三十件、农药三十多万斤。河南省各地供销合作社普遍扩大了生产资料的进货和供应计划，信阳、许昌、洛阳三个专区合作社今冬经营的生产资料较原计划增加百分之一百一十七。绥远省供销合作总社计划供应的各种农具数量达四万七千多件，牲畜三千多头。现牛、马等牲畜已由绥远省乌兰察布盟、伊克昭盟等草原向农业地区调集。
