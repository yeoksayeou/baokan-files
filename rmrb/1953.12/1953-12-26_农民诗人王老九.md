Farmer Poet Wang Laojiu
Shanchuan
Wang Laojiu, a man of strong character,
Composes catchy jingles,
When he stops, everyone feels worried.

This was what the farmers of Beiwangyan Village, Lintong County, Shaanxi Province, said about Wang Laojiu before Liberation.

Saying he has a strong character refers to an incident that happened more than ten years ago. Once, Qin Songcheng, a local tyrant and Lianbao Director, wanted Wang to compose some "auspicious" words for his son's "full month" celebration. Because Wang had loved listening to local operas since childhood and could also perform a few kuaiban pieces, he would always rush to sing at weddings or "full month" celebrations. But this time was an exception. He pretended to have a stomach ache and simply didn't go. This angered Qin Songcheng, who sent his henchmen to rob Wang's grain and money that night, beating him so badly that he slept for seven days and seven nights. Wang was extremely angry, but he didn't give in. He still used his mouth to angrily compose:

Jiang's emperor and Qin's ministers, you oppress the people,
Able to rob wheat and beat people, but you can't chain my heart...

Why was Wang Laojiu so principled? There were reasons. Wang's official name was Wang Jianlu, and he was the ninth child in his family. His family had many people but little land. He only attended private school for a year before dropping out, and from the age of sixteen, he began to work with soil and plows. Before Liberation, he had suffered from the cold on the thirtieth day of the twelfth lunar month, hiding from creditors; he had dragged his twelve-year-old son out to beg for food during famine years; he had been bound, hung, and beaten by Baoding henchmen for failing to pay exorbitant taxes more than once. In this way, he naturally turned these pains and hatreds into poetry, venting the resentment in his heart. Once, while grinding flour, he thought and thought, and composed this passage:

Qin Shihuang (nickname for the tyrant Qin Songcheng)
Hu Manman (referring to Hu Zongnan)
The upper and lower millstones turn happily,
Grinding the people's bones to pieces, squeezing out their blood and draining their sweat,
One day when the heavens open their eyes, we'll smash the millstone and throw it into the river.

He composed no less than a dozen such kuaiban pieces cursing the darkness of the old society, both long and short. Whenever he was free, he would quietly recite them to close friends, and everyone felt strangely comfortable after listening.

The day when "the heavens open their eyes" finally came. Wang Laojiu's kuaiban poems immediately came to the fore. In the winter of 1950, at the public trial of the tyrant, he couldn't restrain his emotions and ran onto the stage, denouncing Qin Songcheng loudly:

Qin Songcheng, big tyrant, rules the world in Xiangqiao,
Wolf heart, dog lungs, tiger teeth, pig face, monkey eyes, gray hair,
Cheeks without flesh, pointed mouth, doesn't recognize his own kin.

He enumerated Qin's crimes of conscripting laborers, extorting money, raping, and killing, one by one. Finally, he called on the masses:

Shoot him outside the city, dig out the roots of the evil,
Sleep soundly at night without fear, remove the big lump in our bellies.

This wish was later fully realized. "Shaanxi Daily" also published this kuaiban poem, and he said with tears of emotion, "The poor have been liberated, and kuaiban has also come to the fore!" Wang Laojiu, this talented farmer poet, could only come to the fore and be cherished and cultivated in the new society. When his first poem appeared in the newspaper, the Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the newspaper wrote letters to encourage him and absorb him as a correspondent. Subsequently, he was also invited to participate in the Shaanxi Provincial Literary and Art Creators Representative Conference. This made the old poet extremely excited, and he became even more diligent in composing kuaiban. In order to learn culture and policies (he only knew a few characters in the past), he specially bought a pair of reading glasses, and every day before resting and going to bed, he would read books and newspapers, and the hand that hadn't held a pen for decades began to practice writing again. He often said to people, "People decline after forty, but I feel younger and younger! I want to increase my knowledge so I can compose a few more sets to sing."

In the spring of 1951, I went to Lintong County and saw Wang Laojiu for the first time. In the evening, many people in the village came to find Wang, asking him to sing "Remove the big lump in our bellies." Wang waved his hand and said, "I won't sing it anymore! We don't laugh at the present, why cry about the past?" He turned to me and said, "It's time to compose new ones. Look, the countryside has changed so much this year, the villagers are truly: Land reform has turned them over, their enthusiasm for production is higher than the sky. Wouldn't we be stubbornly clinging to the past if we kept composing those bitter complaints and cursing bad guys? Don't you agree?" Then he asked me many questions, from the future of social development and the Party's various policies to the lives of Soviet farmers. I told him everything I knew, and he always listened silently with his head down and his eyes closed. We talked for half the night, and he still felt it wasn't enough. When he heard something moving, he would clap his hands and say, "Beautiful! That kind of world is beautiful!"

At daybreak, I suddenly heard a coughing sound. I opened my eyes and saw Wang leaning against the wall, huddled in his quilt, puffing on his dry tobacco pipe. I was startled and quickly asked, "Are you feeling unwell?"

"No. Hey! I can't sleep, I'm laughing even in my dreams. Since Liberation, our people have truly become masters of our own house. The village chiefs and township chiefs are all elected by ourselves, and even my wife has become a women's representative, constantly going to meetings. The bullies and landlords have been overthrown, the poor have been given land, and we no longer have to worry about food and drink. My kuaiban can even be published in the newspaper… These rare things, I never even dreamed of them in the past! Without Chairman Mao, where would we have such a good world?" He raised his head, looked at the portrait of Chairman Mao hanging on the wall, and said, "Sooner or later, I will dedicate a kuaiban poem to you."

Half a year later, the old poet's wish was fulfilled, and he composed the famous "Ode to Chairman Mao."

Thinking of Chairman Mao in my dreams, the sun rises in the middle of the night.
Thinking of Chairman Mao while working, strength surges through my body.
Thinking of Chairman Mao while walking, I don't feel tired pushing the cart.
Thinking of Chairman Mao while eating, steamed buns and soup taste even better.
Cheering for Chairman Mao at meetings, millions of fists are raised together.
Chairman Mao hanging on the wall, a red light shines in the room.
China has Chairman Mao, red flags flutter all over the country.
China has Chairman Mao, old cows will be replaced by tractors.

In July 1951, the old poet came to Xi'an, invited by the Northwest Federation of Literary and Art Circles. Everything in the city was new to him; but the newness that the old poet felt was not the superficial decoration of the city, but the city's intrinsic strength. He visited the spinning mill, the power plant, and the agricultural tool exhibition with great interest. He saw rows of newly built factories. He loved every brick and every machine. Even when he saw a road roller on the street, he had to ask questions, examining it for a long time. When visiting the yarn factory, he picked up a spindle and exclaimed, "How can a spinning wheel keep up! Machines are beautiful!" He also said, "Seeing all kinds of machines this time has cleared my mind! Wearing straw hats, we can't do without swinging hammers. As long as our workers and farmers twist into one rope, and work hard on production and construction, we will all use machines to do everything in the future, and the country will be rich and strong!"

Half a month later, in his kuaiban poem "Wang Laojiu Enters Xi'an," he sang from the bottom of his heart with simple and warm words:

After crossing the Wei River, I took the train, thanks to the old worker brothers;
The workers are like the locomotives, leading us forward;
Traveling a thousand miles in a day, better than an old ox walking for ten autumns.

In more than two years, this old man, who farmed thirty mu of land, stayed up late at night, racked his brains, and composed twenty-eight kuaiban poems praising the new society and new people. These works closely corresponded to every major movement at the time. When the state called on farmers to store and sell cotton, he promptly composed "Old Zhang Loves the Country and Sells Cotton." When the crops were not yet ripe and there was a need to carry out free lending and borrowing for production and self-salvation, he composed "Overcoming the Spring Famine." He was not only a skilled performer of singing and storytelling but more importantly, he was a practitioner walking at the forefront of life. When the government called for drought prevention and resistance, he led the mutual aid group to dig wells and water the land; when the village ran a winter school, he personally went to clean the school building, and then ran around to mobilize women and children to attend the winter school; every year when collecting agricultural tax, he always dried and cleaned the grain and paid it all at once; in the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea and increase production and make donations, he donated his labor income four times. Therefore, when singing about labor, he didn't stop at singing about the external beauty of labor but excavated the inner beauty, the organic connection between labor and patriotism and internationalism. Look at his image of "Zhang Yu?":

Zhang Yu?, Zhang Yu?, scissors on the kang, sickle down the kang,
Hair cut into a short cap, big feet "lively scatter" in a puff of smoke,
Can carry, can lift, spins the spinning wheel happily,
Like a bee sucking flower petals, spins six liang and three qian every day…………

After the New Year to the Spring Festival, village community fires are bustling,
Yu? sews at home, makes three pairs of socks completely,
Thick soles, solid uppers, ant needlepoint on the side,
Round sock heels, pointed toes, embroidered with peacocks playing with peonies,
Not for selling money, not for wearing, sincerely sending them to Korea.

Because the old poet vividly sang the lives, thoughts, and feelings of the broad masses of farmers, his works spread throughout the rural areas of Shaanxi. A reading group in Hekou District, Feng County, would ask the members to read Wang Laojiu's kuaiban poems two or three times every time they appeared in the newspaper. Some women even proposed to learn from "Zhang Yu?". Another folk artist named Liu Bangdou praised the old poet this way:

Wang Laojiu, truly capable, your kuaiban is really "chan" (good)
Clear and concise, the masses love to listen and love to recite.
The propaganda effect is truly not shallow, listening again and again without getting tired.

Not long ago, this sixty-year-old poet returned from Beijing after attending the Second Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers. The first thing he said to people was: "I saw Chairman Mao, he was calculating problems even while walking, looking at where to build a factory and where to open a mine, creating happiness for us everywhere." Then he sank into deep thought, pondering new poetic lines again. He said: "Wait for me to sing a kuaiban poem praising Beijing!"

    农民诗人王老九
    山川
    王老九，硬骨头，
    编得一口“顺嘴溜”，
    要是住了口，大伙发忧愁。
    这是解放以前，陕西省临潼县北王墕村的农民们对王老九的赞语。
    说他骨头硬，是指的十多年前一件事。有一次，当地恶霸、联保主任秦颂丞给儿子过“满月”，想叫老王编一段“吉庆”的话。因为老王自幼爱听小戏，也能说上几段快板。平时谁家娶媳妇、做
  “满月”，他一听说早就跑去唱开啦。可是这次却例外，他假装肚疼，偏偏不去。这一下惹恼了秦颂丞，打发狗腿子当晚抢走老王的粮食银钱，打的他睡了七天七夜。老王气愤极了，他没有软下去，仍然以自己的一张嘴愤怒地编道：
    蒋家天子秦家臣，你把百姓整得狰，
    能抢麦子能打人，拴不住老子一颗心。……
    王老九为啥这么有骨气？也是有原因的。老王官名叫王建禄，排行第九。小时家里人口多土地少，念了一年私塾就失学了，从十六岁起开始和土块、犁耙打起交道。解放前，腊月三十躲避债主的风寒，他受过；灾荒年间，拖着十二岁的大娃出外讨饭，他经过；交不起苛捐杂税，被保丁狗腿绳捆吊打，他也挨过不止一次。就这样，他便很自然地把这些痛苦仇恨变成诗歌，泄泄肚里的窝囊气。有一回在磨面时，他磨着想着，编出了这么一段：
    秦始皇（恶霸秦颂丞的外号）
    胡蛮蛮（指胡宗南）
    上下磨扇转得欢，
    磨得百姓骨头碎，血榨净来汗抽干，
    有朝一日天睁眼，砸烂磨扇撩河滩。……
    像这样咒骂旧社会黑暗的快板，长长短短编了不下十几段。一闲下，他便轻声念给亲近的人听，大伙听罢都觉得怪舒服。
    “天睁眼”的日子果然到来了。王老九的快板诗马上出头露面了。一九五零年冬天，在公审恶霸的大会上，他抑制不住自己的感情，跑上主席台，大声痛斥秦颂丞：
    秦颂丞，大恶霸，相桥为王坐天下，
    狼心狗肺老虎牙，猪脸猴眼灰头发，
    两腮无肉尖嘴巴，睁眼不认他乾大。
    他把秦贼拉伕派款，奸淫烧杀的罪恶，一项一项地数个不尽。最后他号召群众：
    城外将他一枪打，要把祸根干净挖，
    夜晚睡觉不害怕，除掉肚里大疙?。
    这个愿望后来完全实现了。“陕西日报”又登载了这篇快板诗，他感动地流着泪说：“穷人翻身咧，快板也出头啦！”王老九这位有才华的农民诗人，只有在新社会里才能出头，才能得到珍爱和培养。当他第一篇诗歌出现在报上的时候，文联、报社就一封一封地写信鼓励他，吸收他作通讯员。随后，又请他参加了陕西省文艺创作者代表会议。这使老诗人兴奋极了，编快板也更加勤快起来。为了学文化、学政策（过去多少识下几个字），他专门买了一付老花眼镜，每天歇晌、睡觉前总要看书读报，几十年没有握过笔的手又重新练习写字了。他常对人说：“人上四十心自败，我却越活越年轻啦！我要增见识，好多编几套唱唱。”
    一九五一年春天，我到临潼县去，第一次看到了王老九。晚上，村里好多人都来找老王，叫他唱“除掉肚里大疙?”。老王把手一摆说：“不唱咧！眼前放下笑咱不笑，哭?恓惶为啥呢？”回头又对我说：“该编新的了。你看，这一年乡下变化多大，乡亲们真是：土地改革把身翻，生产热劲高过天。咱再编那些吐苦水骂坏蛋的，不是死啃老骨头吗？你说对不？”接着问了我好多问题，从社会发展前途、党的各项政策一直扯到苏联农民的生活。我尽我所知道的都说了，他总是那样低头合眼默默地听着。谈了半夜，他还老嫌不够。听到动人处，他便把手一合，说：“美！那号世事才美！”
    天麻麻亮，忽然听见一阵咳嗽声音，睁开眼，见老王背靠着墙紧缩在被窝里，把旱烟锅抽得“呼呼”响。我吃了一惊，忙问：“身子不舒服吗？”
    “不是。嘿！睡不着，梦里也在笑。自从解放后，咱们人民真算当家作主啦，村长、乡长都由自己选，连我那老婆也当了妇女代表，圪拧拧地常去开会哩。恶霸、地主斗倒了，穷人分到土地，再不愁吃喝了，我的快板也能上报了……这些稀罕事情，过去连作梦都没有想到啊！没有毛主席，哪有如今这么好的世事。”他抬起头，望着墙上挂的毛主席像又说：“迟早我要给你老人家献一段快板诗的。”
    半年以后，老诗人的心愿达到了，他编出了有名的“歌颂毛主席”。
    梦中想起毛主席，半夜三更太阳起。
    作活想起毛主席，周身上下增力气。
    走路想起毛主席，手推小车不知累，
    吃饭想起毛主席，蒸馍拌汤添香味。
    开会欢呼毛主席，千万拳头齐举起，
    墙上挂着毛主席，一片红光照屋里，
    中国有了毛主席，山南海北飘红旗，
    中国有了毛主席，老牛要换拖拉机。
    一九五一年七月间，老诗人来西安了，他是由西北文联邀请的。城市的一切，对他来说都是新鲜的；但老诗人所感受的新鲜，并不是城市的表面装饰，而是城市的内在力量。他用最大的兴趣参观了纺纱厂、发电厂和农具展览会，他看到了一座座新修的工厂。每一块砖头，每一架机器，他都是那样的热爱。甚至在街上看到压路机，也要问这问那，端详半天。参观纱厂的时候，他拿起一个纱锭赞叹地说：“纺车怎能赶得上！机器就是美！”他又说：“这次看到各样机器，脑子更清亮啦！戴草帽离不开抡铁锤的，只要咱们工农扭成一股劲，好好生产建设，将来做啥都使唤机器，国家不富强才怪呢！……”
    半个月后，在他的“王老九进西安”这篇快板诗中，就用朴实、亲切的字句，从心底里唱出了：
    过了渭河坐火车，感谢工人老大哥；
    工人好比火车头，引着咱们向前走；
    一日能进千里路，赛过老牛走十秋。
    两年多的时间，这位种着三十亩地的老人，守灯熬夜，费尽思索，编出了二十八篇歌颂新社会新人物的快板诗。这些作品都紧紧地配合着当前每一个重大运动。当国家号召农民储棉售棉的时候，他就及时地编出了“老张爱国卖棉花”，当庄稼青黄不接，需要展开自由借贷生产自救的时候，他又编出了“渡春荒”。他不仅是一位说说唱唱的能手，更重要的是他自己就是一位走在生活前头的实干家。政府号召防旱抗旱，他便带动互助组打井浇地；村里办冬学，他亲自去打扫校舍，然后又跑前跑后动员妇女娃娃上冬学；每年征农业税时，他总是把粮食晒干扬净、一次交清；在抗美援朝、增产捐献运动中，他四次捐出了自己的劳动收入。因此，歌唱劳动，他不停止在歌唱劳动的外形美，而是发掘内在的美，发掘劳动和爱国主义、国际主义的有机联系。再看看他的“张玉?”的形象吧：
    张玉?，张玉?，上炕剪子下炕镰，
    头发剪成短帽盖，大脚“活洒”一溜烟，
    又能挑，又能担，纺线车子拧得欢，
    如同蜜蜂吸花瓣，每日能纺六两三…………
    过罢新年到春节，村里社火闹喧喧，
    玉?在家挽针线，三双鞋袜做齐全，
    底子厚，帮子坚，蚂蚁针尖纳上边，
    袜根圆，头头尖，绣个孔雀戏牡丹，
    不为卖钱不为穿，实心实意寄朝鲜。
    由于老诗人生动地唱出了广大农民的生活、思想和感情。他的作品传遍了陕西农村。凤县河口区一个读报组，每见报上有王老九的快板诗时，组员们非叫念两三遍不可。有些妇女还提出要向“张玉?”学习。另一位叫刘邦斗的民间艺人，这样称赞老诗人：
    王老九，真能干，你的快板实在“谄”（好）
    又明了，又简短，群众爱听又爱念。
    宣传效果真不浅，一听再听不厌烦。
    不久以前，这位六十岁的老诗人从北京开罢中国文学艺术工作者第二次代表大会回来，见人头一句话就是：“我可看到毛主席啦，他老人家走路也在盘算问题哩，看在那达修个工厂，那达开个矿山，处处给咱们造幸福。”接着他就沉入深深的思索中，又在琢磨新的诗句了。他说：“等着我唱歌颂北京的快板诗吧！”
