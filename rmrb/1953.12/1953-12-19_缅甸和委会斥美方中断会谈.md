Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, December 18th: The Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace issued a statement on the 14th, condemning the US representative, Dean, for interrupting the bilateral talks on the Korean Political Conference, a new conspiracy to undermine the convening of the Korean Political Conference. The statement first said: Dean's unilateral announcement of an indefinite adjournment and his premature withdrawal from the meeting imitated the old trick of the US representative unilaterally withdrawing from the Korean armistice negotiations. Its purpose was also to undermine the success of the conference and to conspire to prevent a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The statement pointed out: The Soviet government's efforts to promote the Korean armistice are well known to the people of the world. However, in this meeting, the US representative first shamelessly insisted on identifying the Soviet Union as a belligerent country, and then unilaterally announced an indefinite adjournment. This deliberate conspiracy to undermine a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue has been even more exposed. The statement said: Dean's withdrawal from the bilateral talks on the Korean Political Conference is merely a trick by the US government to create international tension. The statement finally emphasized: If the Korean Political Conference cannot achieve success and the Korean issue cannot be resolved peacefully, the US government should bear full responsibility.

    缅甸和委会斥美方中断会谈
    【新华社十八日讯】仰光消息：缅甸保卫世界和平委员会在十四日发表文告，斥责美国代表迪安中断关于朝鲜政治会议的双方会谈破坏朝鲜政治会议的召开的新阴谋。文告首先说：迪安片面宣布无限期休会，并中途退出会议，系效法在朝鲜停战谈判时美国代表片面退会的故技，它的目的同样是为了破坏会议的成功，阴谋使朝鲜问题不能和平解决。文告指出：苏联政府促成朝鲜停战的努力，已为全世界人民所共知。但是在此次会谈中，美国代表先则无耻地硬指苏联为参战国家，继而又片面宣告无限期休会，这种蓄意破坏和平解决朝鲜问题的阴谋已更加暴露无遗。文告说：迪安退出关于朝鲜政治会议的双方会谈，不过是美国政府制造国际紧张局势的一种花样而已。文告最后着重指出：假如朝鲜政治会议不能达到成功，朝鲜问题不能得到和平解决，美国政府应负完全责任。
