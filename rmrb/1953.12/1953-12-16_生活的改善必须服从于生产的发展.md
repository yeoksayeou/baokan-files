　　On the basis of developing production, gradually improving the material and cultural living standards of the people is one of our country's important economic policies. This contains two principles: on the one hand, our purpose in developing production is to meet the people's growing material and spiritual needs; the people's happy life is the highest criterion of the work of the Communist Party and the People's Government. On the other hand, the improvement of people's lives cannot exceed the speed of production development, so as to ensure the accumulation of national funds and promote further development of production. The people of the whole country should correctly understand the relationship between production and life according to these two principles.

　　What is the basis for developing production? This is to expand industry and agriculture, especially industry, and especially heavy industry. Only with the development of heavy industry, more steel production, increased fuel and power such as coal, electricity, and petroleum, developed machinery manufacturing and basic chemical industries, can we ensure the complete independence of our economy and the security of our national defense, manufacture materials and equipment for light industry and transportation, promote their development, provide material and technical conditions for the transformation of agriculture, and enable continuous expansion of social production, and on the basis of continuous growth of social production, people's lives can be continuously improved.

　　Of course, building heavy industry is not an easy task. First of all, it requires a lot of funds. Building a steel joint factory requires tens of trillions of yuan in investment, and we are not only building one steel factory, nor are we only building steel factories without building other factories, so the funds required are even more. As a result, in order to invest in the construction of these factories, a considerable part of the wealth we create every year cannot be directly used to improve people's lives. Secondly, building heavy industry also requires a long period of time. It takes at least three to five years, or even seven to eight years, to start production on a coal mining shaft or a large hydropower station. Therefore, even if we invest huge amounts of funds, we still cannot get the results we should get in the short term. In order to develop industry, capitalist countries either accumulate funds by plundering the people of colonial countries; or obtain funds by squeezing the people of defeated countries; or borrow foreign funds by selling certain rights of their own people, in short, they establish their own industrial base on the basis of sacrificing the interests of the vast majority of people and making a few people rich. Of course, we cannot take this path. We can only rely on the accumulation of domestic production and the national austerity system, and other methods to carry out construction. And this will inevitably contradict the speed of improvement in living standards. The only way to resolve this contradiction is to make the improvement of our lives subordinate to the development of production. There is no other way to go besides this one.

　　Perhaps some people think that since building heavy industry is so expensive and time-consuming, and agriculture still occupies a major position in our country's current production, why don't we try our best to develop agriculture, export grain and raw materials, and exchange them for daily necessities from the socialist Soviet Union or from capitalist countries? Wouldn't this be able to improve people's lives quickly? This idea is very wrong.

　　In recent years, with the strong assistance of the Soviet Union, we have used a part of agricultural products to exchange for a lot of machinery and daily necessities from the Soviet Union and People's Democratic countries, so that the equipment of our industry has been continuously increased. This kind of trade relationship within the socialist camp is equal and mutually beneficial; in the future, the trade relationship within the socialist camp will continue to develop and strengthen. But we know that the industrial and agricultural production of the Soviet Union are developing proportionally. It is impossible for it to reduce its own agricultural production in order to absorb too much of our agricultural products, or to increase the production of daily necessities too much in order to supply us, thereby destroying their production ratios. With the rapid progress of socialist construction and the daily improvement of people's living standards, the daily necessities needed by the Soviet Union are increasing year after year, and it is impossible to supply us too much. As for exchanging daily necessities from capitalist countries, this is still being done now, but it only accounts for a very small part of our foreign trade, because the blockade and embargo of American imperialism threaten our import of daily necessities from capitalist countries, and importing commodities from capitalism is another matter, where we are often subject to the risk of price reductions and increases in the capitalist market, causing us great losses. If we rely on the capitalist market for a long time, our country will lose its economic independence. China was in a semi-colonial position for a long time in the past, and its economy became a competitive market for imperialist commodities. It was in a backward and poor agricultural country for a long time. There was no industry, and agricultural production was not developed. Every year, it had to import cotton and grain from foreign countries. The living standards of the Chinese people were also the lowest in the world. The Chinese people have tasted this kind of pain for more than a hundred years.

　　Industry is certainly important, but can we first concentrate our efforts on developing light industry? It requires less funds and takes less time to put into production, which can improve people's lives more and faster. This view is also wrong. Because the development of light industry must have the support of heavy industry. Without heavy industry, light industry will have no way to obtain machines to expand production, and ultimately, it will not be able to meet the people's growing material needs. Of course, there are also such countries in the world that only have light industry, and this industry also has a certain development, but because they cannot manufacture their own production tools and means of production, and completely rely on imports from capitalist countries, they cannot become an economically independent country and still cannot get rid of the status of a colony, let alone improve the people's lives.

　　Perhaps some people also think that developing heavy industry is necessary, but can we slow down the pace a bit? Our country's economy has now fully recovered, and some sectors have even exceeded the highest level in Chinese history. Why can't we take a break and make everyone feel more relaxed? This view is also wrong. Before liberation, China's economy was very backward, with the industrial output value accounting for only about 10% of the total national economy. Because of this backward state, we were often bullied by imperialism. If we only see the achievements of the three-year recovery period today and are complacent, refusing to further accelerate industrialization, it is tantamount to keeping us in a backward state for a long time, without the power to deal with imperialism's unexpected attacks on us. In addition, from the domestic situation, the scattered and fragmented small-scale peasant economy and its backward production still account for the majority, and capitalist industry still exists. Although socialist large-scale industry is growing every day, it is still just a small island in the sea. This small-scale peasant economy is currently our industry's main market on the one hand, but on the other hand, due to its backward technology and the capitalist spontaneous forces that continue to arise on the basis of the small commodity economy, it hinders the development of the country's planned economic construction. In order to overcome the tendency to develop towards capitalism, and in order to ensure the smooth progress of socialist construction, we must accelerate the development of socialist large-scale industry, especially the development of heavy industry, in order to carry out the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and use new technologies to promote the collectivization of agriculture, and strive for the early realization of socialism. Only when socialist construction is successful can people's lives be improved and improved accordingly at an early date.

　　Socialist industrialization is a very important task, and we must concentrate all manpower and material resources to ensure its realization. Then, can we completely ignore the improvement of people's lives? Of course not, and in fact, it is not. For example, the purchasing power of farmers and the people of the whole country has increased by about 20% this year compared with last year. Except for a few senior staff, the living standards of workers and farmers have exceeded the level before the War of Resistance Against Japan. With the improvement of the material life of the people of the whole country, there has also been a significant improvement in cultural life. By 1952, the total number of students in national universities increased by 42% compared with 1950, the number of students in secondary schools increased by more than double, and the number of students in primary schools increased by nearly double. In addition, many spare-time schools for workers and farmers and quick literacy classes were also established. National health care and publishing have also greatly developed. It can be seen that we are not constantly lowering the people's living standards, but gradually improving the people's living standards on the basis of developing production. The task of socialist industrialization puts forward to the people of the whole country only requires that the improvement of living standards should be subordinate to the development of production, and should not exceed the speed of production development. For example, if we produce and create a profit of one million yuan, the expenditure used to directly improve people's lives should not be 1.2 million yuan, nor should all one million yuan be spent; in addition to a part of it being used to gradually improve people's lives, a part of it should also be used as national accumulation, so as to invest in the construction of new industries. Even in that part used to improve people's lives, we should resolutely not use what can be not used, and we should try not to use or postpone the use of what can be used or not, save this part of the funds to increase construction investment.

　　However, not everyone has recognized these truths. At present, including the cadres of some of our leading organs, they still do not understand that to engage in construction, we must promote the spirit of hard struggle. They think that since the new China has been established and the economic recovery work has been going very smoothly, the improvement of people's lives should be increased without restrictions. Therefore, some places blindly expand urban construction, build parks and roads, and do not hesitate even if the waste is serious. Some departments promulgate public medical treatment methods without estimating the possibilities and necessities, but in fact, they do not work and instead arouse public dissatisfaction. Some units build worker sanatoriums that are divorced from reality, with carpets and steel beds, and workers are not used to sleeping on them. These also affect the confusion of the masses' thinking. With the improvement of people's living standards, the number of school-age children has surged, and this year, some primary school students cannot enter secondary school because the secondary schools cannot accommodate them, so they expressed great dissatisfaction and demanded the construction of more secondary schools; with the development of national economic construction, the population of some large cities and industrial and mining areas has increased rapidly, and housing is very crowded, so some people feel uncomfortable and shout for more and faster construction of houses; with the increase of the urban population, they have to queue up to buy tickets to see movies, trams are crowded, and public entertainment venues are not enough, so some people feel very inconvenient and even complain. Of course, these demands of the people are justified. In fact, in recent years, the People's Government has also continuously increased facilities in schools, housing, cinemas, trams, etc., but if it exceeds the existing possibilities, investing too much in these facilities will weaken the needs of economic construction, which is detrimental to the long-term interests of the country and the people.

　　The people of the whole country must clearly realize that only if we concentrate all our efforts on economic construction can we gradually transition to socialism, and this task is more arduous than the task of the Chinese revolution that has already been completed. When Lenin discussed the dual tasks that the Soviet proletariat must solve to overthrow the rule of the bourgeoisie and establish a socialist economy, he pointed out:
　　"This second task is more difficult than the first, because to solve this task, we absolutely cannot rely on the heroic spirit of sporadic efforts, but we need the longest, most tenacious, and most difficult spirit shown in the broad daily work. But this task is also more important than the first, because in the final analysis, only new and higher social modes of production, only large-scale socialist production that replaces capitalist production and petty-bourgeois production, can become the greatest source of strength necessary to defeat the bourgeoisie, and can become the only guarantee that this victory is unshakable." It was precisely by following Lenin's instructions that the Soviet people, after a long period of hard struggle, finally obtained the happiest life in the world today.

　　We must also learn from the Soviet Union's example to build our motherland and promote the spirit of hard struggle, just as Chairman Mao once instructed us, seizing national victory is only the first step in a long march of ten thousand miles. The road after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and the work is more arduous. Therefore, we must continue to maintain the style of modesty, prudence, no arrogance, and no impetuosity, and maintain the style of hard struggle. We must follow Chairman Mao's instructions. Carry forward and inherit the excellent traditions of hard struggle, heroic sacrifice, close unity, abiding by discipline, overcoming difficulties, and perseverance of the Chinese Communists, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Chinese People's Volunteers, and the Chinese working people in the three domestic wars, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, to build our country's industry. We must realize that the temporary restraints on our lives today, and a little bit of endurance or sacrifice in our lives, are simply insignificant compared to the great cause of earth-shaking change that we are undertaking. A little bit of small endurance and sacrifice from us today can be exchanged for unlimited happiness for our children and grandchildren. What's more, some of the difficulties we have in our lives today are only difficulties in the ever-increasing national economy, difficulties in the ever-progressing development of our country, and many of them are precisely new difficulties caused by the faster improvement of living standards!

　　Therefore, our slogan today, the program of action for the people of the whole country, should be: Everything for the construction of the motherland, promote the spirit of hard struggle.

### 生活的改善必须服从于生产的发展

    生活的改善必须服从于生产的发展
    在发展生产的基础上，逐步提高人民物质生活和文化生活水平，这是我国的重要经济政策之一。这里包含着两个原则：一方面，我们发展生产的目的，是为了满足人民日益增长的物质和精神需要；人民的幸福生活是共产党和人民政府工作的最高准则。另一方面，人民生活的改善，又不能超过生产发展的速度，以便保证国家资金的积累，促进生产的进一步发展。全国人民都应该根据这两个原则，正确地认识生产和生活的关系。
    发展生产的基础是什么呢？这就是要扩大工业和农业，其中特别是工业，又特别是重工业。只有重工业发展了，钢铁生产多了，煤电石油等燃料和动力增加了，机器制造业和基本化学工业发达了，才能保证我国经济的完全独立和国防的安全，才能为轻工业和交通运输业制造器材和设备，促进它们的发展，也才能给农业的改造提供物质的和技术的条件，才能使社会生产不断扩大，在社会生产不断增长的基础上人民生活才能不断改善。
    当然，建设重工业是一件很不容易的事情。首先，它需要很多的资金，建设一座钢铁联合工厂，就需要投资几十万亿元，而我们既不是只建立一座钢铁工厂，又不是只修建钢铁厂而不修建其它工厂，因而所需要的资金就更多了。结果，为了投资建设这些工厂，我们每年所创造的财富，就有不小的一部分不能直接用来改善人民的生活。其次，建设重工业还需要较长的时间，建设一座采煤的竖井或建设一座大型水力发电站，少则三、五年，多则七、八年才能开工生产。因此，我们即便投入了巨大的资金，也还不能在短期间内得到我们应该得到的成果。资本主义国家为了发展工业，他们或者是用掠夺殖民地人民的办法来积累资金；或者是用榨取战败国人民的办法来获得资金；或者是用出卖本国人民的某些权利而借用外国的资金，总之，他们是用牺牲广大人民的利益而在少数人发财致富的基础上建立起自己的工业基础的。我们当然不能走这一条道路。我们只能依靠国内生产的积累和全国人民的节约制度等等办法来进行建设。而这就必然会和生活改善的速度发生矛盾，解决这个矛盾的办法，只有使我们生活的改善服从于生产的发展。除了这条道路而外，是没有其它的道路可走的。
    也许有人认为，建设重工业既然如此费钱费事，而目前我国农业生产还是占主要地位，我们何不尽力发展农业，输出粮食和原料，从社会主义的苏联或者从资本主义国家换回日用品，这不是就能很快使人民生活得到改善吗？这种想法是非常错误的。
    最近几年来，在苏联大力援助下，我们曾用一部分农产品从苏联和人民民主各国换回了不少的机器和日用品，使我国工业的装备得到不断的增涨，社会主义阵营内这种贸易关系是平等互助的；今后还会继续发展和加强社会主义阵营内的贸易关系。但是我们知道：苏联的工农业生产都是按比例发展的，它不可能为了过多地吸收我们的农产品而去削减自己的农业生产，或为了供应我们而过多地增加日用品生产，破坏他们的生产比例。随着社会主义建设的突飞猛进，人民生活水平日益提高，苏联所需要的日用品年复一年的增长着，也不可能过多的供应我们。至于说到从资本主义国家换回日用品，现在也还在做，但这只占我们对外贸易的很小一部分，因为美国帝国主义的封锁和禁运，使我们从资本主义国家输入日用品受到威胁，而从资本主义输入商品则是另一回事情，那里常常受到资本主义市场压价和涨价的危险，使我们遭受很大的损失，如果长期依靠资本主义市场，我们国家就会丧失经济上的独立。中国过去长期的处于半殖民地的地位，经济上成为帝国主义商品的竞争市场，长期的处于落后的贫困的农业国，没有工业，而农业生产也不发达，每年还得从外国输入棉花和粮食，中国人民的生活水平，在世界上也是最低的，中国人民已经尝受了一百余年的这种痛苦。
    工业固然重要，但是我们能不能先集中力量发展轻工业呢？它所需要的资金较少，投入生产的时间也较快，这就能更多更快地改善人民生活。这种看法也是错误的。因为轻工业的发展必须有重工业的支持，没有重工业，轻工业就无从得到机器来扩充生产，最后，它也就不能满足人民日益增长的物质要求。当然，世界上也有这样的国家，它们只有轻工业，而且这种工业也有一定的发展，但是由于它们自己不能制造生产工具和生产资料，完全依靠从资本主义国家进口，因而他们便不可能成为一个经济上独立的国家，仍然不能摆脱殖民地的地位，也就更谈不到人民生活的改善了。
    也许还有人认为，发展重工业是必需的了，但是可不可以把进度放慢一点呢？目前我国经济既已完全恢复了，某些部门还超过了中国历史的最高水平，为什么不能稍许歇歇气，使大家都松快一些呢？这种看法也是错误的。解放以前中国的经济是十分落后的，工业产值只占全部国民经济总产量的百分之十左右，由于这种落后的状态，因而我们便经常受到帝国主义的欺侮。如果今天只看到三年恢复时期的成就而沾沾自喜，拒绝再进一步加紧工业化，这不啻是使我们继续长期处在落后的状态，没有力量应付帝国主义对我们的意外的袭击。此外，从国内情况来看，散漫零碎的小农经济及其落后的生产，仍然占大多数，资本主义工业也还存在，社会主义的大工业虽然每日都在增长，但毕竟还只是大海中的一个小岛。这种小农经济目前一方面固然还是我们工业的主要市场，而另一方面，由于它的技术落后以及在小商品经济基础上不断产生的资本主义自发势力，却又妨碍着国家有计划经济建设的发展。为了克服向资本主义发展的趋向，为了保证社会主义建设的顺利进行，我们就必须加紧发展社会主义的大工业，特别是发展重工业，以便进行对资本主义的工商业的社会主义改造和用新的技术去推动农业的集体化，争取社会主义的早日实现。只有社会主义建设成功，人民的生活才能早日得到相应的改善和提高。
    社会主义的工业化是一项十分重要的任务，我们必须集中一切人力物力来保证它的实现。那么，对人民生活的改善是不是就可以完全不去注意它呢？当然不是这样的，事实上也不是这样的。例如，农民和全国人民的购买力，今年就比去年提高了百分之二十左右，除了少数高级职员而外，工人和农民的生活水平，都超过了抗战前的水准。随着全国人民物质生活的改善，在文化生活方面也有显著提高，到一九五二年止，全国高等学校学生总数比一九五零年增加了百分之四十二，中等学校学生增加了一倍多，初等学校学生增加了将近一倍。此外还创办了很多工农业余学校和速成识字班。全国卫生保健事业和出版事业也有很大发展。由此可见，我们不是不断降低人民生活水平，而是在发展生产的基础上，逐步提高着人民的生活水平。社会主义工业化的任务向全国人民提出的要求，只是生活的改善要服从生产发展的情况，不要超过生产发展的速度。例如我们生产创造了一百万元的利润，用在直接改善人民生活方面的开支，就不要是一百二十万元，也不要将一百万元全部花掉；其中除了一部分用来逐步改善人民生活外，还应该有一部分作为国家的积累，以便用来投资建设新的工业。就是用来改善人民生活的那一部分中，凡是可以不用的也应该坚决不用，凡是可用可不用的也应该尽量不用或延期使用，节约这一部分资金增加建设投资。
    但是，并不是所有的人都已认清了这些道理。目前，包括我们若干领导机关的干部在内，都还不懂得要从事建设就必须提倡艰苦奋斗的作风。他们以为既然新中国已经成立了，经济恢复工作进行得又很顺利，因而人民生活的改善也就应该没有约束的加以提高。于是，有些地方盲目地扩大城市建设，修公园、修马路，虽然浪费严重也在所不惜。有些部门不估计可能与必要，颁布公费治疗办法，但实际上行不通，反而引起群众的不满。有的单位修工人疗养所脱离生活实际，用地毯、钢丝床，工人睡觉不习惯。这些也影响群众思想的混乱。随着人民生活水平的提高，入学的学童激增，今年有一部分小学生因为中学容纳不下而不能升学，于是就表示十分不满，要求增建中学；随着国家经济建设的发展，若干大城市和工矿区的人口增加很快，住房十分拥挤，于是有人感到不舒服，叫喊着要更快地更多地修建房屋；随着城市人口的增加，看电影要排队买票了，乘电车拥挤了，公共娱乐的场所怎么也不够用了，于是也有人感到十分不便利甚至发牢骚。当然，人民群众的这些要求都是正当的，事实上几年来人民政府也不断地增加了学校、住宅、电影院、电车等等方面的设施，但是如果超过了现有的可能，在这些设施方面过多的进行投资，其结果就会削弱经济建设的需要，这对国家和人民的长远利益都是不利的。
    全国人民都必须清楚认识到，只有我们集中全力来进行经济建设，才能逐步过渡到社会主义，而这个任务是比中国革命已经完成的任务更加艰巨的。列宁在论苏联无产阶级必须解决推翻资产阶级统治和建立社会主义经济的两重任务时曾经指出：
  “这第二个任务要比第一个任务更加艰难，因为解决这个任务，绝对不能靠零星奋发的英勇气概，而是需要有广泛日常工作中所表现的最长期、最顽强和最困难的精神。但这个任务同时又比第一个任务更加重要，因为归根到底，只有新的、更高的社会生产方式，只有为代替资本主义生产和小资产阶级生产而起的大规模社会主义生产，才能成为战胜资产阶级所必需的那种力量的最大泉源，才能成为这种胜利坚固不移的唯一保证。”苏联人民正是遵循着列宁的这一指示，经过长期的艰苦奋斗，才终于获得了今天世界上最幸福的生活。
    我们要建设我们的祖国，也应该学习苏联的榜样，提倡艰苦奋斗精神，也正如毛主席曾经指示我们的，夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。因此就应该务必继续保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，保持艰苦奋斗的作风。我们必须遵循毛主席的指示。发扬和继承中国共产党人、中国人民解放军、中国人民志愿军、中国劳动人民在三次国内战争、抗日战争和抗美援朝运动中艰苦奋斗、英勇牺牲、亲密团结、遵守纪律、克服困难、坚韧不拔的优良传统，来建设我国的工业。必须认识到，我们今天在生活上暂时加以约束，在生活上的一点点忍耐或牺牲，这和我们所正在进行的翻天覆地的伟大的事业来比，那简直是小得微不足道了。我们今天的一点点小的忍耐和牺牲，对我们的子子孙孙来说，就可以换来无限的幸福。更何况今天我们在生活上的一些困难，还只是全国经济日益高涨中的困难，是我们国家日益进步中的困难，其中有很多也还正是由于生活改善的较快而产生的新的困难呢！
    因此，我们今天的口号、全国人民的行动纲领应该是：一切为了祖国的建设，提倡艰苦奋斗的作风。
