(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 30th) The delegations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China participating in the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference issued the following communique:

On November 30th, the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference resumed. Our side presented comprehensive proposals on the five agenda items of the bilateral talks. Mr. Ki Sok-bok, the representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, made an important speech when presenting this proposal. The full text of our comprehensive proposal and Mr. Ki Sok-bok's speech are as follows:

The bilateral talks have been going on for more than a month, and your side has been constantly adopting delaying tactics. On the issue of agreeing on the agenda of the bilateral talks alone, your side delayed for eighteen days, and finally reached an agreement on the five agenda items that our side suggested from the beginning. Now, in the group discussions on the issues of members, location, and time, there have been another twelve days of delay. On the issue of members, your side has even absurdly claimed that the Soviet Union is one of the belligerent parties in Korea, opposed neutral countries participating in the political conference as members, and set various restrictions, attempting to make neutral countries lose their due role in the political conference. On the issues of location and time, your side has deliberately delayed and never conducted serious discussions. Therefore, the twelve proposals put forward by your side on November 28th were not intended to solve the problem and reach an agreement so that the political conference could be convened quickly, but to delay the bilateral talks, deliberately put forward many unreasonable claims in order to cause controversy and not be resolved. In this way, the bilateral talks can be dragged past your so-called prisoner of war detention period, so as to avoid the political conference and realize your conspiracy to forcibly detain more than 20,000 of our captured personnel by taking unilateral action.

In order to break your conspiracy and promote the bilateral talks to reach an agreement on a fair and reasonable basis, so as to facilitate the rapid convening of the political conference, our side now puts forward comprehensive proposals on the five agenda items of the bilateral talks. If your side is still sincere in solving the problem, your side has no reason not to conduct serious discussions on our comprehensive proposals and accept them.

Our comprehensive proposals are as follows:

Article 1: Members and Location of the Political Conference
    1.  The political conference should take the form of a meeting of equals between the two sides of the armistice agreement. The parties participating in the political conference should have full power to handle the proceedings of the meeting. The relevant countries of the two sides of the armistice agreement participating in the political conference are: the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China on one side, and the seventeen countries that provided their armed forces to the United Nations Command: Australia, Belgium, Canada, Colombia, Abyssinia, France, Greece, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the Philippines, Thailand, Turkey, the Union of South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States, and South Korea, on the other side.
    2.  All decisions of the political conference must be unanimously agreed upon by the relevant countries of the two sides of the armistice agreement, and shall be binding on each signatory country.
    3.  In order to promote and ensure the smooth progress of the political conference, the political conference should invite five other relevant neutral countries—the Soviet Union, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Myanmar—to participate as members of the conference, but not belonging to either side. Neutral countries should participate in the discussion of all agenda items agreed upon by both sides of the political conference without any restrictions, and provide opinions to facilitate the reaching of an agreement between the two sides. Neutral countries should also participate in the subsidiary bodies of the political conference. Neutral countries shall not participate in any voting of the political conference or subsidiary bodies.
    4.  The political conference should be held in New Delhi, India.

Article 2: Time of the Political Conference
    5.  The political conference should be convened on December 28, 1953.

Article 3: Procedure of the Political Conference
    6.  Agenda of the Political Conference: A. Prisoner of War Issue; B. Withdrawal of All Foreign Troops from Korea; C. Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Issue; D. Other Relevant Issues.
    7.  Voting Procedure of the Political Conference: Every country on both sides to the Armistice Agreement will participate in voting. If any country has dissenting opinions, consultations should continue immediately. Every country on each side should accept the constraints of the agreements to which they participate.
    8.  The rules of procedure for the political conference should be drafted by a subcommittee composed of an equal number of representatives from both sides after an agreement is reached on the entire agenda of the bilateral talks, and then submitted for approval after the political conference is convened.
    9.  The organizational charter of the political conference should be drafted by a subcommittee composed of an equal number of representatives from both sides after an agreement is reached on the entire agenda of the bilateral talks, and then submitted for approval after the political conference is convened.
    10. The languages of the political conference should be Korean, Chinese, and English as the official languages of the conference. The Korean, Chinese, and English texts of all resolutions and documents of the political conference shall have the same effect. Representatives of the relevant neutral countries may bring their own interpreters to participate in the conference.
    11. Release of Communiqués: When the political conference makes major decisions, joint communiqués should be issued after consultation between the two sides. For meetings of a confidential nature, no communiqués or news shall be released during the proceedings without the consultation and decision of the representatives of both sides attending the political conference.

Article 4: Administration of the Political Conference
    12. Pre-conference Preparation: After an agreement is reached on the entire agenda of the bilateral talks, both sides should send a joint secretariat composed of an equal number of representatives to New Delhi, India, to contact the Indian government and handle pre-conference preparations with the assistance of the Indian government.
        After the political conference is convened, the above-mentioned joint secretariat shall be responsible for jointly handling all relevant matters concerning conference documents and administration.
    13. News Coverage: The two sides of the armistice agreement have the right to approve a certain number of journalists to conduct interviews and reports on the conference. Journalists shall not participate in any meetings of the political conference.

Article 5: Expenses of the Political Conference
    14. The expenses required for the political conference shall be borne by the two sides of the armistice agreement on an equal basis, including the expenses of the relevant neutral countries participating in the conference.
    15. The expenses of the delegations of the countries of the two sides of the armistice agreement participating in the political conference shall be borne by the respective countries themselves.

Mr. Huang Hua, the representative of the People's Republic of China, expressed complete agreement and support for the comprehensive proposals put forward by Mr. Ki Sok-bok. Mr. Huang Hua pointed out: Our comprehensive proposals are fair and reasonable. As long as the other side has the sincerity to convene a political conference to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, as long as the other side can abandon the conspiracy to deliberately delay in order to sabotage the armistice agreement and detain our captured personnel, the other side has no reason to oppose our comprehensive proposals.

The US side still slandered the Soviet Union with unreasonable attitudes, denied the neutral status of the Soviet Union, and opposed our proposal. Our side immediately refuted it. The US side stated that it would study our comprehensive proposals and request instructions from the other seventeen governments, and requested an adjournment until December 2. Our side once again pointed out: Our proposals are fair and reasonable. If the other side does not intend to delay deliberately, there is no reason to oppose them. We hope that the other side will seriously consider them and accept them. Agreed to adjourn until December 2.

    关于政治会议问题的双方会谈恢复举行代表会议
    我方就会谈的五项议程提出全面建议
    【新华社开城三十日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国参加关于政治会议问题双方会谈的代表团发表公报如下：
    十一月三十日关于政治会议问题的双方会谈恢复举行双方代表会议。我方就双方会谈的五项议程提出了全面建议。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表奇石福先生在提出此项建议时并作了重要的发言。我方全面建议及奇石福先生的发言全文如下：
    双方会谈进行了一个多月，你方不断地采取拖延政策。仅仅在商定双方会谈的议程问题上，你方就拖延了十八天，最后才在我方一开始就建议的五项议程上达成协议。现在，在成员和地点问题及时间问题的分组讨论中，又拖延了十二天。在成员问题上，你方竟胡说苏联为朝鲜交战双方的一方，反对中立国作为政治会议的成员来参加会议并定出种种限制，企图以此使中立国在政治会议中失去其应有的作用。在地点及时间问题上，你方有意拖延，从未进行过认真的讨论。因此，你方在十一月二十八日所提的十二项建议，其目的并非为了解决问题，达成协议，使政治会议得以迅速召开，而是为了拖延双方会谈，故意提出许多毫无道理的主张，以便引起争论，不得解决。这样，就可把双方会谈拖过你方所谓的战俘拘留期限，以便躲开政治会议，来实现你方企图采取片面行动强迫扣留二万余名我方被俘人员的阴谋。
    为了打破你方这一阴谋，并推动双方会谈在公平合理的基础上达成协议，以利政治会议的迅速召开，我方现在就双方会谈的五项议程，提出全面建议。如果你方还有诚意解决问题，你方就没有理由不就我方的全面建议进行认真的讨论，并加以接受。
    我方的全面建议如下：
    第一条、政治会议的成员和地点
    一、政治会议应采取停战协定缔约双方对等会议的形式。参加政治会议的双方对于会议的进行应有全权处理。参加政治会议的停战协定缔约双方有关国家为：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、中华人民共和国两国为一方，以及向联合国军提供其武装部队的国家：澳大利亚、比利时、加拿大、哥伦比亚、阿比西尼亚、法国、希腊、卢森堡、荷兰、新西兰、菲律宾、泰国、土耳其、南非联邦、英国、美国和南朝鲜十七国为另一方。
    二、政治会议的一切决定必须取得停战协定缔约双方有关国家的一致同意，并对每一签字国均具有约束力。
    三、为推动和保证政治会议的顺利进行，政治会议应邀请五个其他有关中立国家——苏联、印度、印度尼西亚、巴基斯坦和缅甸参加，作为会议的成员，但不属于双方的任何一方。中立国家应不受任何限制地参加政治会议经过双方协议的全部议程项目的讨论，提供意见，以利于推动双方达成协议。中立国家并应参加政治会议的附属机构。政治会议或附属机构的一切表决，中立国家均不参加。
    四、政治会议应在印度的新德里举行。
    第二条、政治会议的时间

    七、政治会议表决程序：参加政治会议的停战协定缔约双方的每一国家一律参加表决。任何一国如有不同意见，应即继续进行协商。双方每一国家均应接受其所参预的协议的约束。

    九、政治会议组织章程，应于双方会谈全部议程取得协议后，由双方派出同等人数的代表组成小组委员会协商草拟，待政治会议召开后提出通过。
    十、政治会议语言，应以朝文、中文、英文为会议正式语言。政治会议的一切决议和文件的朝文、中文、英文三种文本均有同样效力。各有关中立国家代表得自带译员参加会议。
    十一、发布公报：在政治会议作出重大决定时，应经过双方协商，发表联合公报。凡属秘密性质的会议，在进行期间未经出席政治会议的双方代表协商决定时，一律不得发表任何公报或新闻。
    第四条、政治会议的行政
    十二、会前准备：双方应于双方会谈全部议程取得协议后派出同等人数的代表组成联合秘书处，前往印度的新德里与印度政府进行接洽，并在印度政府协助下办理会前准备事宜。
    在政治会议召开后，上述联合秘书处，应负责共同处理会议文件及行政的一切有关事宜。
    十三、新闻采访：停战协定缔约双方有权批准一定数目的记者对会议进行采访报道。政治会议的一切会议，记者均不得参加。
    第五条、政治会议的经费
    十四、政治会议所需经费，应由停战协定缔约双方在平均分担基础上负担之，包括参加会议的有关中立国家之费用在内。
    十五、参加政治会议的停战协定缔约双方的各国代表团本身的费用应由各国自行负担之。
    中华人民共和国代表黄华先生对奇石福先生提出的全面建议表示完全同意和支持。黄华先生指出：我方的全面建议是公平合理的，只要对方有召开政治会议和平解决朝鲜问题的诚意，只要对方能放弃故意拖延以便破坏停战协定、扣留我方被俘人员的阴谋，对方就没有理由反对我方的全面建议。
    美方代表仍以无理态度诋毁苏联，否认苏联之中立地位，反对我方建议。我方当即予以驳斥。美方表示为研究我方全面建议并向对方十七国政府请示，要求休会至十二月二日。我方再次指出：我方建议公平合理，对方如非蓄意拖延实无理由加以反对，希望对方认真考虑并加以接受。同意休会至十二月二日。
