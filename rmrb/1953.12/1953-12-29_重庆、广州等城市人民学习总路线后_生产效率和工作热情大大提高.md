    After being educated on the General Line, people from all walks of life in cities such as Chongqing, Guangzhou, Dalian, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Nanchang, and Nanning have been encouraged by the bright future of socialism in our country, and their production efficiency and work enthusiasm have greatly increased.
    When widely carrying out the General Line propaganda, all cities generally held various types of meetings. The heads of the local CCP committees and people's governments gave reports at various meetings, and some also went deep into factories, schools, government offices, and among citizens to give reports. In order to make the propaganda of the General Line deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, all cities also organized and trained a large number of propaganda teams. The CCP Chongqing District Committees and Chongqing Municipal Trade Union Organization held special training classes for propaganda personnel. Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Wuxi, and other eleven cities trained nearly 40,000 propagandists and propaganda backbones. The Party and government leading organs of Guangzhou organized more than 2,870 cadres to go to factories, schools, and street resident groups to carry out propaganda work. Due to the depth and breadth of the propaganda activities, an extremely large number of people have been educated on the General Line. According to current statistics, there are 1.2 million people in Guangzhou, 400,000 in Chongqing, more than 1.8 million in Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Wuxi and other eleven cities, 200,000 citizens in Hangzhou alone, and more than 35,000 cadres in Dalian who have listened to reports.
    The people from all walks of life who have been educated on the General Line are looking forward to the bright and brilliant future of socialism. Workers at the state-owned Hangzhou Universal Machine Factory said: Socialism can now be seen and touched. In order to allow ourselves and our future generations to live a happy life like today's Soviet workers, let us work harder! Many workers and staff in factories and enterprises recognized their glorious mission of striving for the socialist goal, and loved their work and business even more. After hearing the report, some students wrote cordial letters to their relatives in the countryside and other places, to publicize the beautiful vision of socialism to them. They said: Every effort made by the older generation will add a bit of happiness to us. When some residents in Hangzhou first heard the General Line propaganda, they thought it had nothing to do with them. After linking the various changes in Hangzhou over the past four years with their own personal issues and studying, they realized that the implementation of the national General Line has a great relationship not only with themselves, but also with their future generations, and unanimously expressed their support for the General Line. Residents in some places also said: In the future, we should pay attention to thrift and reduce waste, and use the surplus money to buy public bonds or deposit it in the bank to help the country accumulate construction funds.
    The staff and cadres in government offices, enterprises, and factories in various cities, in accordance with the spirit of the General Line, examined and improved their production and work. Liu Mofu, Deputy Manager of the Dalian Department Store Wholesale Store, said: In the past, I only knew how to do business and complete tasks, and did not consider how to exert the role of state-owned commerce in leading the market, and how to strengthen business leadership and assistance to supply and marketing cooperatives. He said: If we can maintain close contact with the cooperative network in the city and suburbs, we can better lead the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and reduce the exploitation of peasants by private merchants, so that the majority of peasants can recognize the benefits of cooperatives and attract them to join the cooperatives. After studying the General Line, this store began to strengthen contact with the supply and marketing cooperatives in the suburbs in November, sending product catalogs, organizing cooperative salespersons to visit, and sending cadres to help the cooperatives improve their business management. After examining their conservative ideas in the study, the staff and workers in many factories in the city have increased their confidence in striving to accelerate socialist industrialization, and have widely launched a technical innovation movement. Employees in sixteen factories throughout the city have successively proposed 801 rationalization proposals related to improving production tools, improving operating methods, and improving labor organization. 472 of them have been adopted, creating a total value of 36.5 billion yuan for the country.
    Encouraged by the General Line, people from all walks of life have actively taken action and achieved various new achievements in production and work. The workers and staff of the state-owned Chongqing 101 Steel Plant launched a competition to complete the annual production tasks ahead of schedule, and recently completed the annual plans for six major products and basic construction projects such as steel rails and pig iron ahead of schedule. The staff and workers of the newly built southwest's largest 507 Power Plant pumping station project, after connecting their glorious tasks with the country's socialist industrialization and recognizing their glorious mission, greatly increased their enthusiasm. They revised the original plan to complete the entire project in 58 days to 48 days. Lin Wenhan, leader of the lathe team of the state-owned Nanjing 307 Factory, and the workers studied the Soviet Kolesov tool method, improved the cutting tool, and increased production efficiency by 22 times. Workers at the Guangzhou Private Dongzhou Flashlight Factory increased production from 200 dozen flashlights per day to 365 dozen. After studying the General Line, many clerks in private shops in the city unanimously agreed that they should not only assist capitalists in improving their operations, but also further supervise capitalists so that they love the country, abide by the law, and obey the leadership of the state-owned economy. After studying the General Line, educators in various places loved the bright future of socialism in the motherland even more. Lai Zhiji, associate professor of South China Institute of Technology, said: "Our teaching is closely related to socialist industrialization." He expressed that he would work with the educators of the whole college to actively strive to cultivate talents for national construction. After studying the General Line, the work enthusiasm and work efficiency of many government office workers also continue to increase.
    After studying, the members of the local organizations of the democratic parties in various cities unanimously expressed that they would work hard to implement the General Line. After studying, private industrialists and businessmen have clearly realized that as long as they honestly accept socialist transformation, accept the state's policies of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce, and give play to the role of private industry and commerce that is beneficial rather than harmful to the national economy and the people's livelihood, their future will be bright.

    重庆、广州等城市人民学习总路线后
    生产效率和工作热情大大提高
    重庆、广州、旅大、南京、杭州、无锡、镇江、南昌、南宁等城市的各界人民，受到总路线教育后，为我国社会主义的美好前途所鼓舞，生产效率和工作热情大大提高。
    各城市在广泛开展总路线宣传时，普遍召开了各种类型的会议，当地的中共党委和人民政府负责人，分别在各种会议上作了报告，有的还深入到工厂、学校、机关和市民中作报告。各城市为了使总路线的宣传能够深入人心，还组织和训练了大批的宣传队伍。中共重庆市各区委员会和重庆市工会组织，专门举办了宣传人员训练班。南京、镇江、苏州、无锡等十一个城市训练了宣传员和宣传骨干近四万人。广州市的党、政领导机关组织了两千八百七十多名干部，分头到工厂、学校、街道居民小组中，开展宣传工作。由于宣传活动的深入和广泛，受到总路线教育的人极为众多，据目前的统计，广州市有一百二十万人，重庆市有四十万人，南京、镇江、苏州、无锡等十一个城市有一百八十多万人，杭州市仅市民就有二十万人，旅大市听过报告的干部有三万五千多人。
    受到总路线教育的各界人民，向往着社会主义的光辉灿烂的前途。国营杭州通用机器厂的工人说：社会主义已经看得清，摸得着了，为着使自己和后代子孙过着像今天苏联工人一样的幸福生活，让我们加紧干吧！许多工厂企业的工人和职员认识了自己正在为社会主义目标而奋斗这一光荣使命，更加热爱自己的工作和业务。有些学生听到报告后，亲切地写信给远在乡间和外地的亲人，向他们宣传社会主义的美好远景。他们说：年长一辈的每一个努力，都为我们增加一分幸福。杭州市有的居民开始听到总路线宣传时，认为这对他们没有什么关系，经过联系四年来杭州各个方面的变化和自己的切身问题学习后，知道了实行国家的总路线不仅对自己，而且对自己的后代子孙有很大的关系，都一致表示拥护总路线。有些地方的居民还表示：今后要注意节约，减少浪费，把多余的钱买公债或存到银行里，帮助国家积累建设资金。
    各城市机关、企业和工厂中的职工和干部，根据总路线的精神，检查并改进了自己的生产和工作。旅大市百货批发商店副经理刘谟富说：过去光知道做买卖完成任务，没有考虑怎样发挥国营商业领导市场的作用，以及怎样加强对供销合作社的业务领导和扶助。他说：如果能经常和市内、市郊的合作社网保持密切联系，就能更好地领导城乡物资交流，减少私商对农民的中间剥削，这样就可以使广大农民认识合作社的好处，吸引他们参加合作社。经过学习总路线以后，这个商店从十一月份便开始加强对市郊供销合作社的联系，送商品目录表，组织合作社营业员参观，并派干部帮助合作社改善经营管理。该市不少工厂中的职工，在学习中检查了保守思想后，提高了为加速社会主义工业化而奋斗的信心，广泛地开展了技术革新运动。全市十六个工厂里的职工，先后提出有关改进生产工具、改进操作方法、改进劳动组织等合理化建议八百零一件，其中已有四百七十二件被采纳，共为国家创造价值三百六十五亿元的财富。
    在总路线的鼓舞下，各界人民积极行动起来，在生产和工作上取得了各种新成就。国营重庆一零一钢铁厂工人和职员，展开提前完成全年生产任务的竞赛，最近已提前完成钢轨、生铁等六项主要产品和基本建设工程的全年计划。新建的西南最大的五零七电厂水泵房工程的工作人员和工人，联系国家的社会主义工业化认识到自己的光荣任务以后，积极性大大提高，他们将原订五十八天完成全部工程的计划，改订为四十八天完成。国营南京三零七厂车工组组长林文翰，和工人一道研究苏联科列索夫车刀法，改进切刀，提高生产效率二十二倍。广州市私营东洲电筒厂工人从每天生产二百打电筒提高到三百六十五打。该市许多私营商店店员学习总路线后，一致认为不仅要协助资本家改善经营，而且要进一步监督资本家，使他们爱国守法，服从国营经济的领导。各地教育工作者在学习总路线后，更加热爱祖国的社会主义的光明前途。华南工学院副教授赖支机说：“我们的教学是和社会主义工业化息息相关的。”他表示要和全院的教育工作者一道积极为培养国家建设人材而努力。许多机关的工作人员学习总路线以后，工作热情和工作效率也不断提高。
    各城市的民主党派地方组织的成员，经过学习后，一致表示要为贯彻总路线而努力。私营工商界人士学习后，已明确认识到只要老老实实接受社会主义改造，接受国家利用、限制和改造资本主义工商业的政策，发挥私营工商业对于国计民生有利的而不是有害的作用，自己的前途就会是光明的。
