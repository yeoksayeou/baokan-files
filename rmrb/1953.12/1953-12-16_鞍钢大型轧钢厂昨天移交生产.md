    Anshan Iron and Steel Company's newly built large rolling mill held a signing ceremony at 3:00 PM on December 15th to mark its completion and handover for production. From this point forward, China's first mechanized and automated large rolling mill is officially declared victoriously completed.

    The signing ceremony was conducted in a solemn and exciting atmosphere. After Hua Ming, Acting General Manager of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the person in charge of capital construction, and the director of the large rolling mill, signed the six grey leather-bound, gold-lettered certificates of handover for the new large rolling mill project in turn, those attending the ceremony applauded warmly, shaking hands with each other to congratulate the victorious completion of this project. The handover certificates for the large rolling mill will be submitted to the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government for final signature.

    At the signing ceremony, Hua Ming, Acting General Manager of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, said in his speech: The completion and commissioning of the large rolling mill will strongly support the country's transportation construction and various industrial construction projects, and accelerate the pace of national industrialization. Liu Jiadong, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Anshan Municipal Committee, pointed out in his speech: While celebrating the successful commissioning of the large rolling mill, we must first thank the Soviet government and the Soviet people for their comprehensive and selfless assistance to the construction of Anshan Iron and Steel Company. Li Wen, Director of the Large Rolling Mill, stated at the meeting: We must take good care of the machinery and equipment of the large rolling mill, strive to complete the national production plan, and ensure the supply of high-quality steel to economic construction throughout the country. Romanenko, the chief Soviet expert consultant, congratulated everyone at the meeting and expressed his hope that all employees of Anshan Iron and Steel Company would better complete the even greater construction tasks in the future.

    The construction of China's largest modern large rolling mill project began on August 1, 1952. By the end of November this year, it was fully completed in just one year and four months. Since the hot trial rolling started on November 30, most of the large round steel, seamless steel pipe billets, and heavy steel rails produced are first-class products. After strict technical inspection, it has been proven that the entire factory's construction and installation project is of excellent quality.

    据新华社讯：鞍山钢铁公司新建大型轧钢厂，在十二月十五日下午三时举行了竣工移交生产签字仪式。从此，我国第一座机械化自动化的大型轧钢厂，正式宣告胜利完工了。
    签字仪式是在庄严和兴奋的气氛中进行的。当鞍山钢铁公司代总经理华明、基本建设负责人及大型轧钢厂厂长等，在六本灰色皮面金字的新建大型轧钢厂工程交接证明书上轮流签字后，参加仪式的人们都热烈地鼓起掌来，相互握手，祝贺这一工程的胜利竣工。大型轧钢厂交接证明书，将送交中央人民政府重工业部最后签字。
