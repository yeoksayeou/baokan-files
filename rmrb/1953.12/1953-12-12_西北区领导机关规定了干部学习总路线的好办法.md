Northwest District Leading Organs
Stipulate Good Methods for Cadres to Study the General Line

The leading organs of the Northwest District at all levels have stipulated many specific and effective methods for cadres to study the general line of the state during the transition period.

The Northwest Bureau pointed out that the center of the Party's political and ideological work in the past three or four months has been to lead Party members and cadres to conduct a universal and in-depth study of the general line during the transition period, and to conduct extensive publicity among the masses. Cadres should, on the basis of understanding the general line, review and summarize their work, conduct year-end appraisals and deploy next year's work, criticize the bourgeois ideological influence among Party members, further draw a clear line between socialist and capitalist ideologies, and improve the theoretical level of cadres and the socialist awareness of the masses.

Northwest District-level organs have stipulated the organization of systematic reports to help cadres understand the documents, and have determined that 18 leading comrades including Ma Mingfang, Ma Wenrui, Zhao Boping, Wang Feng, Pan Zili, Bai Rushui, and Fang Zhongru will serve as lecturers for reports related to the general line. In addition, it is also stipulated that each unit should designate a special person to give reports to the junior groups and cadres participating in cultural studies, as well as staff members, so that they understand the basic content of the general line.

In order to deepen the research of senior groups and help intermediate groups on various important issues in the general line, and to urge various departments to check their work based on this study, 25 special issues have been specifically proposed, and 28 comrades with leadership responsibilities in various departments have been designated to conduct research, and it is stipulated that these special studies must, under the guidance of Marxist-Leninist theory and the spirit of the general line, proceed from the actual situation in the Northwest District and write reports with facts, analysis, and conclusions; this kind of special research report should be different from a simple business inspection report, nor should it be a general purely academic paper. These special research papers are stipulated to be completed successively before January 20 next year and submitted to the Northwest Bureau Theoretical Study Senior Group for review and processing (either the person himself will give a report to the cadres, or it will be published in newspapers and periodicals, or it will be used as a material for discussion meetings).
