Joint Township Meetings Held in Various Districts of Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province
Educating Rural Activists to Recognize the Two Roads

Joint township meetings were held in various districts of Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province, to conduct socialist education for rural activists. The first batch of joint township meetings in twenty-seven townships concluded on December 4th. Participants included village cadres and mutual aid team leaders.

Prior to the meetings, the leadership first arranged autumn plowing and sowing work, and sent cadres to villages to mobilize people, explaining the purpose of holding the joint township meetings. At the same time, production arrangements were made for village cadres to allow them to attend the meetings with peace of mind.

The meetings first enabled everyone to understand the general line of the state during the transition period. A cadre from the Chengxi District originally thought: "Even if you stretch your neck eight feet long, you won't be able to see socialism." Now, he feels like it's a "happy event" with a set date. Many cadres engaged in rural work believed that there was nothing left to do after the land reform. After listening to the report this time, they said: "Chairman Mao is truly wise, setting the general line, just like drawing a blueprint for building a house. As long as we work hard to carry bricks and tiles and move sand, socialism will definitely be built successfully. Chairman Mao says it, and does it. Following Chairman Mao will never be wrong." When conducting this step of education in each district, based on the experience of the county, district, and township cadres' expanded meeting, they fully used the methods of recalling, comparing, and calculating detailed accounts to help everyone understand the great achievements of the country in the past four years and the benefits gained by the farmers. In the discussion, village cadres and mutual aid team leaders calculated accounts based on the examples of their villages, teams, and themselves, comparing the small to the large and extending the near to the far. In this way, everyone saw the prospects of socialism and realized the actual benefits farmers had received in the state's transition to socialism, and their understanding deepened.

In helping everyone calculate accounts, each district mostly started by comparing the yields before and after liberation. According to calculations from Xinhua, Zhongsheng, and Xinglong townships in the Chengdong District, there were 234,000 mu of land. The total output was only 9,828,000 jin when liberation began, while this year the total output reached 11,800,000 jin, an increase of 1,972,000 jin. The increased grain is enough to supply the farmers of the three townships for a year. They also repeatedly calculated the yield growth of a group and a household over the years. Subsequently, the cadres present discussed the material and cultural lives of the people. A cadre from Xinhe Village, Xinglong Township, Chengdong District, said at the group meeting: "This year, the state bank loaned the whole village 20 million yuan for fertilizer, and the interest for half a year is only 1.2 million yuan. If we borrowed at high interest rates, the lowest interest would be 10 million yuan. In the loan alone, the farmers in the village benefited 8.8 million yuan, which is equivalent to having ten more oxen." Chu Hongchang, the leader of a mutual aid team in Nancun Township, Yeshe District, said: "This year, the cooperative supplied bran. Each share could buy 600 jin, which was 120,000 yuan cheaper than buying from private merchants. Our team of fourteen households saved a total of 20 shi of rice a year." What everyone felt most deeply was the gradual increase in the comparative price of agricultural products exchanged for industrial products. According to the discussions in each district, the things purchased by each mutual aid team from the cooperative this year, just the few major daily necessities such as sugar and oil, were generally 1.5 million to 2 million yuan cheaper than last year. Compared with before liberation, the benefits were even greater. Zhang Defang's mutual aid team in Jixiang Village, Xinglong Township, Chengxi District, signed a purchase contract with the cooperative. The fifteen households in the team saved 1.55 million yuan in just eight daily necessities compared to buying from private stores. The more everyone calculated, the higher their enthusiasm, and their understanding of the general line became more specific.

After the village cadres and mutual aid team leaders understood the benefits of the general line to the farmers, they started by discussing "the old road cannot be taken," analyzed the weaknesses of the small-scale peasant economy, and enlightened and guided the attendees to fully express the pain that the small-scale peasant economy brought to the farmers. In the discussion, everyone understood that the reason for poverty and suffering in the past was not poor labor. Wang Changsheng, a representative from Xinhua Village, Minle Township, Sijing District, said: "In the past, we couldn't live a good life, not because of poor labor; we ate the debt rice of landlords and rich peasants, so we had to plant for them first. We couldn't grasp the season well, and the output couldn't be increased, so we became poorer and poorer." Xu Honggao, a farmer from Chengxi District, had always been diligent and thrifty, but he only got bitten by a snake and had to leave a field uncultivated for one season, which led to bankruptcy. In the discussion, everyone further realized the fragility of the small-scale peasant economy, which was the basis for the cruel exploitation by landlords, rich peasants, and speculative private merchants. Cai Bingxiang, a cadre from Changwu Township, Fengjing District, said: "In the past, we lived a poor life: borrowing at high interest rates, mortgaging land, selling land, selling houses, working as hired laborers, and pawning things." Therefore, everyone concluded: the grain of landlords, rich peasants, and speculative private merchants is the blood of the peasants, and their wealth is the harvest of the peasants. The tragic situation of the peasants is: only caring about filling their stomachs, not being afraid of high interest rates, taking in through the front door and running out through the back door, and still not being able to eat enough next year; the young cry, the old shout, and the whole family has to run away separately.

Secondly, from the facts of class differentiation since liberation, everyone was guided to discuss "Are we satisfied with the small-scale peasant economy? Or do we continue to move forward?" In the discussion, everyone further realized that the small-scale peasant economy is unstable. After the land reform, the general output in the county increased and living conditions improved. However, some farmers who were not organized were forced to sell land and cattle and borrow at high interest rates under the attack of natural disasters and diseases, and the rural class was differentiating. Zheng Zhili, a farmer from Zhengjiafen Village, Chengxi District, was a hired laborer before liberation. During the land reform, he was allocated thirteen mu of land, a room, and a bed. In 1951, he joined a mutual aid team, and the average yield reached 600 jin. In 1952, he withdrew from the team, and his wife fell ill during the busy farming season, so the rice was not planted in time. The yield was only 350 jin in the autumn harvest, and he was in debt for 300,000 yuan. This year, with interest added to interest, he owed more than 1 million yuan and had to sell the bed and work odd jobs. In Fengjing District, fifty-two households in seven villages in Wangwei Township had mortgaged or sold land, mortgaging a total of 257 mu and selling 29.7 mu. According to statistics from Zhangzhuang Township and three other townships in Tiankun District, eleven farmers had sold more than 40 mu of land. When Fengjing District held the joint township meeting, it collected a deed of absolute sale for 2.3 mu of land from Chen Huiliang, a farmer from the third group in Zhongxin Village, Fengdong Township. The cadres present were greatly shocked after seeing it. One representative said: "We fell into the river, and Chairman Mao rescued us."

After telling everyone about the suffering brought by the small-scale peasant economy, they were consciously guided to tell about the crimes of speculative private merchants, so that everyone realized that it was precisely because of the existence of the small-scale peasant economy that private merchants had a position to carry out activities on a large scale. In the complaints in each district, they talked about the phenomenon of speculative private merchants manipulating grain before liberation, causing "low grain prices hurting farmers" and "bumper harvests turning into disasters"; they accused speculative private merchants of continuing to rush to buy grain, hoarding and speculating, disrupting the market, and sabotaging national construction and people's lives after liberation, so that the representatives present clearly realized that they must draw a clear line with speculative merchants and sever ties with them. Cadres in Fengjing District accused Peng Yijun, a speculative and treacherous merchant in Fengjing Town, of making a fortune by lending at high interest rates, cutting prices, and adulterating products. His property grew from eight packages of bran to eight hundred dan of rice. In Dagao Village, Xinhua Township, Chengdong District, sixteen households sold green seedlings to speculative private merchants, claiming 140,000 yuan per shi, but after deducting 30,000 yuan in interest, the farmers actually only received 110,000 yuan. Because the complaints were thorough and the boundaries were clearly drawn, everyone's socialist consciousness was significantly improved, and they checked their own capitalist ideas and expressed their intention to correct them in future work. For example, Wang Zhonglin, a village cadre in Fengjing District, bought six mu of land and lent out 950,000 yuan at high interest rates. After listening to the report, he thought that his father had been a hired laborer for others all his life, and he had turned over during the land reform, and realized that buying land and lending money was an act of "forgetting his roots." After understanding the benefits of taking the socialist road and the harms of taking the capitalist road, the representatives present urgently demanded to take the socialist road. Each district made a special report in response to this demand of the masses. First of all, they explained that the realization of national industrialization not only conformed to the long-term interests of the farmers, but also conformed to the current interests of the farmers. The representatives present discussed the relationship between industry and agriculture and the relationship between workers and farmers, based on their own experiences, and further realized the close relationship between industry and agriculture. When carrying out industrialization education, some district committees seized the facts that farmers felt most deeply and were most interested in to explain the importance of industrialization. For example, when opening the Shenjingtang River in Chengxi District, water-lifting machines were used, and the village cadres personally saw the great power of the water-lifting machines. Therefore, their understanding of industrialization was relatively deep. Everyone reflected: "When irrigating, people are not as good as cattle, and cattle are not as good as machines." An old woman in her fifties in Renmin Village, Minle Township, Sijing District, used to catch insects in the radish fields every year, and both of her hands were rotten. This year, she used "666" powder to treat the insects, and the insects were eliminated, and the yield was also increased, harvesting 40 dan of radishes per mu. She felt that "666" powder was the most beneficial. Some districts also compared the production of agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual farming, compared supply and marketing cooperatives with private merchants, and compared credit cooperatives with high-interest loans, so that the cadres present established a firm will to move towards cooperativization. Zhang Defang, the leader of a mutual aid team in Chengxi District, said: "In the past, I only knew that mutual aid teams were good and had high yields, but I didn't know why they were good. In the future, leading mutual aid teams will have a direction." Some said: "The small-scale peasant economy is like peach blossoms in March, full of red on the trees, but the shadows disappear with the wind and rain. Cooperatives are like pine trees, green all year round." Some said: "Looking at the duck boats united, they are not afraid to cross the Yangtze River." After recognizing the importance of national industrialization and agricultural cooperativization, the issue of the worker-peasant alliance was then discussed. After the discussion, the cadres present clearly understood the principle of industry leading agriculture and agriculture supporting industry. Lu Zhenbao from Zhongsheng Township, Chengdong District, said: "Long knives, short planes, round pots, square shovels, it won't work without workers; it is also very important for farmers to support industry with grain by sowing beans and wheat in autumn and planting rice in spring." Everyone guaranteed to support the national industrial construction with the action of selling surplus grain.

    江苏省松江县各区召开联乡会议
    教育农村积极分子认清两条道路
    江苏省松江县各区召开联乡会议，向农村积极分子进行社会主义教育。现第一批二十七个乡的联乡会议，已于十二月四日结束。参加会议的，有村干部、互助组组长等。
    会议前，领导方面首先布置了秋耕秋种工作，并派干部分头到村里进行动员，说明召开联乡会议的目的，同时对村干部的生产作了安排，使他们安心参加会议。
    会议首先使大家懂得了国家过渡时期总路线。城西区一个干部原先认为：“头颈伸到八尺长，也盼不到社会主义。”现在却觉得像做“喜事”一样，有了日期。不少做农村工作的干部，认为土地改革以后没有事了。这次听了报告以后说：“毛主席真英明，定下了总路线，就像造房子画好了图样，只要我们努力挑砖瓦、搬沙泥，社会主义一定建设成功。毛主席说到那里，做到那里，跟着毛主席走，不会错。”各区在进行这一步教育时，根据县区乡干部扩大会议的经验，充分运用回忆、对比、算细账的方法，使大家了解四年来国家的伟大成就和农民得到的好处。在讨论中，村干部、互助组组长又联系本村、本组、本人的事例算了账，以小比大，以近推远。这样，大家就看到了社会主义的远景，体会到国家在向社会主义过渡中农民得到了实际利益，认识也就深刻了。
    在帮助大家算账中，各区大都先从对比解放前后的产量开始。根据城东区新华、中胜、兴隆三乡的计算，共有二十三万四千亩土地，刚解放时总产量只有九百八十二万八千斤，今年总产量达到一千一百八十万斤，增产了一百九十七万二千斤，增产的粮食足够供应三个乡农民一年的食用。又反复地计算了一组一户历年来产量的增长情况。接着，到会干部又联系人民的物质生活和文化生活进行讨论。城东区兴隆乡新河村干部在小组会上说：“今年国家银行贷给全村肥料贷款二千万元，半年的利息只要一百二十万元，要是借高利贷，最低的利息，也要一千万元。仅仅在贷款一项上，全村农民就得到好处八百八十万元，等于多了十头耕牛。”叶榭区南村乡互助组长储鸿昌说：“今年合作社供应麸糠，每一社股买到六百斤，比起私商来，便宜了十二万元，我们组里十四户人家，一年共省了二十石大米。”大家体会最深刻的是农业品交换工业品比价的逐步提高。根据各区的讨论，每一个互助组今年向合作社购买的东西中，光是糖、油等几项主要日用品，一般都比去年省一百五十万元到二百万元；与解放前比，好处就更大了。城西区兴隆乡吉祥村张德芳互助组与合作社订了购货合同，全组十五户，一年中仅仅八项日用品，就比向私营商店买的便宜一百五十五万元。大家越算情绪越高，对总路线的认识就更加具体了。
    在村干部、互助组组长懂得了总路线对农民的好处以后，又从讨论“老路走不得”开始，分析了小农经济的弱点，启发、引导到会的人尽情倾诉小农经济带给农民的痛苦。在讨论中，大家明白了过去受穷受苦的原因，并不是劳动不好。泗泾区民乐乡新华村代表王长生说：“过去过不到好日子，不是劳动不好；吃了地主、富农的债米，只好替他先种，自己季节抓不牢，产量就提不高，结果是越做越穷。”城西区农民徐鸿高，一生勤俭，只不过被蛇咬了一口，就荒了一熟田，结果弄到破产。大家在讨论中进一步认识到小农经济的脆弱，它是地主、富农和投机私商残酷剥削的基础。枫泾区昌梧乡干部蔡丙祥说：“过去，我们过的穷生活：借高利贷，典田，卖田，卖屋，当雇工和上典当。”因此大家得出结论：地主、富农和投机私商的粮食是农民的血，他们的财富是农民的收成。农民的悲惨情景是：只图肚皮饱，不怕利息高，前门收进后门跑，明年还是吃不饱；小的哭，老的叫，一家只好分散跑。
    其次，从解放以后阶级分化的事实，引导大家讨论“满足小农经济呢？还是继续前进？”在讨论中，大家进一步认识到小农经济是不稳定的。全县土地改革以后一般的产量有了提高，生活有了改善。但也有一部分没有组织起来的农民在天灾、疾病的袭击下，被迫卖田、卖牛，借高利贷，农村阶级在分化。城西区郑家坟村农民郑志利，解放前是一个雇工，土地改革时分进了十三亩土地，一间房屋和一张床。一九五一年参加互助组，平均产量达到六百斤。一九五二年他退出了组，农忙时妻子病倒，稻子因而没有及时种上，秋收时产量只有三百五十斤，就负了三十万元债。今年，利上加利，他欠了一百多万元，只好卖掉床，自己又打零工去。枫泾区王圩乡七个村已有五十二户典田、卖田，共典掉二百五十七亩，卖掉了二十九亩七分。根据天崑区张庄乡等四个乡的统计，已有十一户农民卖了四十多亩田。枫泾区在开联乡会议时，曾收集到一张枫东乡中心村第三组农民陈惠良二亩三分土地的卖绝笔据，到会干部看过以后，都大为震惊。有一个代表说：“我们跌到河里去了，毛主席把我们救起来。”
    诉了小农经济带给大家的苦处，又有意识地引导大家诉投机私商的罪恶，使大家认识到：正是由于小农经济的存在，才使私商有了大肆活动的阵地。各区在诉苦中，诉说了解放前投机私商操纵粮食，造成“谷贱伤农”、“丰收成灾”的现象；控诉了解放后投机私商继续抢购粮食，囤积居奇，捣乱市场，破坏国家建设和人民生活的罪恶，使到会代表明确认识，必须与投机商人划清界限，割断联系。枫泾区干部控诉了枫泾镇上投机奸商彭以均用放高利贷、杀价、搀杂等办法发了财，他的财产由八包麸皮发展到八百担大米。城东区新华乡大高村有十六户把青苗卖给投机私商，讲的是十四万元一石，但扣去利息三万元，实际上农民只拿到十一万元。由于诉苦诉得透彻，界限划得清楚，大家的社会主义觉悟有了显著的提高，纷纷检查了自己的资本主义思想，表示要在今后工作中改正。如枫泾区村干部王忠林，买了六亩田，放出高利贷九十五万元。他听了报告，想到父亲替人家当了一辈子雇工，自己在土地改革中翻了身，认识到买田放债是“忘本”行为。到会代表在明白了走社会主义道路的好处和走资本主义道路的坏处以后，就迫切要求走社会主义道路。各区针对群众这一要求，都作了专门报告。首先讲明实现国家工业化，不仅符合农民的长远利益，也符合农民目前的利益。到会代表联系切身经验，漫谈讨论了工业和农业的关系，工人和农民的关系，进一步认识了工业和农业的密切关系。有的区委在进行工业化教育时，抓住农民体会最深、兴趣最大的事实，来说明工业化的重要性。如城西区在开沈泾塘河时，曾使用过戽水机，村干部亲眼看到戽水机的力量大，因此，对工业化的理解，就比较深刻。大家都反映：“灌水时人不如牛，牛不及机器。”泗泾区民乐乡人民村一个五十多岁的农妇，过去年年在萝卜田里捉虫，两只手都烂了；今年用“六六六”粉治虫，消灭了虫子，产量也提高了，每亩收萝卜四十担，她就感觉“六六六”粉好处最大。有的区又对比了农业生产合作社、互助组与单干的生产，对比了供销合作与私商，又以信贷合作对比高利贷，使到会干部树立了走向合作化的坚定意志。城西区互助组长张德芳说：“过去只晓得互助组好，产量高，但不知道为什么好，以后领导互助组有方向了。”有的说：“小农经济像三月桃花满树红，风吹雨打影无踪。合作社像苍松，一年四季青葱葱。”有的说：“看鸭船联合起来，过长江也不怕了。”在认识了国家工业化、农业合作化的重要意义后，接着又讨论工农联盟问题。经过讨论，到会干部大家明确认识了工业领导农业、农业支持工业的道理。城东区中胜乡陆珍宝说：“长的料刀，短的刨，圆的锅子，方的铲刀，没有工人就不行；农民是秋种豆麦春种稻，用粮食支持工业，也非常重要。”大家保证以出售余粮的行动来支援国家工业建设。
