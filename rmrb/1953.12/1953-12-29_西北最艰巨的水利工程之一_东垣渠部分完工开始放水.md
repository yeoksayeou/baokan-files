    One of the Most Difficult Water Conservancy Projects in the Northwest
    Partial Completion and Water Release of the Dongyuan Canal

    The Dongyuan Canal water conservancy project in Qinghai Province has been partially completed. Water was released on the 23rd of last month, and people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai held a grand celebration on the day of the water release.

    The Dongyuan Canal is a channel that uses water from the Huangshui River in Qinghai to irrigate the dry land on the Dongyuan shoal in Minhe County. The canal is seventy-two li long. Between the Huangshui River and the Dongyuan shoal, a distance of thirty-six li, there are nine mountains. The Dongyuan Canal is one of the most difficult water conservancy projects in the Northwest. The number of carts transferred from various places to transport stones alone reached 180,000. In 1952, the Central People's Government decided to invest 43.4 billion yuan to build the Dongyuan Canal in order to help people of all ethnic groups develop production. It is expected to be fully completed in the second quarter of 1954. After the completion of this canal, 40,000 mu of dry land on the Dongyuan shoal can be turned into paddy fields, increasing grain production by more than 9.7 million catties each year.

    With the tenacious efforts of more than 4,000 workers and technicians, the Dongyuan Canal project has now tunneled through forty-three rock caves and nine earth mountain caves, and built one hundred and fifty-four large and small structures, opening the way for the Huangshui River to flow to the Dongyuan shoal, which is eighty meters above the local water level. Before the water release, representatives and masses of all ethnic groups enthusiastically went to visit, walking through the sixteen-li-long earth and stone mountain caves. From the grand project of this canal, they more deeply realized the deep care of the People's Government for people of all ethnic groups.

    西北最艰巨的水利工程之一
    东垣渠部分完工开始放水
    青海省东垣渠水利工程已部分完工。上月二十三日开始放水，青海各族人民在放水日举行了盛大的庆祝会。
    东垣渠是利用青海湟水河的水浇灌民和县东垣滩上旱地的一条渠道。渠长七十二里。从湟水河到东垣滩的三十六里之间，隔着九座山，东垣渠的工程是西北最艰巨的水利工程之一，光是从各地调去参加运送石头的大车，就有十八万辆。一九五二年，中央人民政府为扶助各族人民发展生产，决定投资四百三十四亿元修筑东垣渠，预计一九五四年第二季度全部完工。这一道渠完工后，东垣滩上四万亩旱地可变为水田，每年可增产粮食九百七十多万斤。
    东垣渠工程在四千多名工人和技术人员顽强努力下，现已凿通四十三座石洞和九座土山洞，修成大小建筑物一百五十四座，打开了湟水流往高出当地水面八十公尺的东垣滩上的道路。放水前，各族代表和群众踊跃前往参观，他们穿行在长达十六华里的土、石山洞中。从这一道水渠的浩大工程里，他们更加体会到人民政府对各族人民的深切关怀。
