    We Strive to Do Well in Supporting Anshan Iron and Steel
    -- A Letter from Wang Yunguang of the State-Owned Shanghai Light Bulb Factory to the Lu Zhaolan Group
    Comrades of the Lu Zhaolan Group:
    A few days ago, I saw the news of your group’s victory in the Liberation Daily, and I must first congratulate you. Now, you have become a quality model group in the Anshan Iron and Steel Metal Structure Company. I hope you will continue your efforts and strive to become a national quality model!
    Your group is able to cultivate technicians, carefully study blueprints before work, specifically discuss construction plans, and insist on quality inspection in a tense working environment, all of which are worth learning from. In particular, many comrades stay until late at night to maintain strict project quality, and this spirit of ownership is even more admirable.
    Comrade Zhaolan: In addition to being pleased, I must also report to you the production achievements of our factory. Our factory used to be a tool for American imperialism to invade China's economy. The tungsten wire used to make light bulbs was shipped from the United States. After liberation, American aggressors attempted to strangle the development of our country's industry through blockades. However, they were wrong. The Chinese working class has a high degree of wisdom and creativity, and there are no difficulties that we cannot overcome. Before the fourth National Day this year, the first light bulb made with domestic tungsten wire finally shone. At the same time, electric heating wire, bimetallic strips, and tungsten carbide drawing dies were also successfully trial-produced. When Shenyang Electric Engineering Factory No. 14 heard that our factory had successfully trial-produced bimetallic strips, they immediately sent people to Shanghai to ask our factory to manufacture some bimetallic strips for them. It is said that part of their task is for Anshan Iron and Steel, and the need is very urgent. When the comrades in our group heard this, they tried their best to do a good job in indirectly supporting Anshan Iron and Steel under the conditions of incomplete equipment. Sometimes they even squeezed out time to eat, as long as it is to support Anshan Iron and Steel, we have the energy.
    Finally, I wish the comrades of your group good health.
                   State-Owned Shanghai Light Bulb Factory Wang Yunguang

### 我们竭力做好支援鞍钢的工作——国营上海灯泡厂王云广给卢兆兰小组的信

    我们竭力做好支援鞍钢的工作
    ——国营上海灯泡厂王云广给卢兆兰小组的信卢兆兰小组同志们：
    前几天，在解放日报上看到你组的胜利消息，我首先应向你们祝贺。现在，你们已成为鞍钢金属结构公司的一个质量模范小组，希望你们再接再厉，争取成为全国的质量模范哩！
    你组在紧张的工作环境下，能善于培养技工，能认真在工作前学习图纸，具体讨论施工计划，坚持检验质量等工作，都值得我们学习的。尤其是许多同志为了严格保持工程质量，坚持至深夜才回家，这种主人翁的态度更是令人敬佩。
    兆兰同志：我在欣慰之下，也得报告你我厂的生产成绩，我厂过去是美帝国主义侵略中国经济的工具，制造灯泡用的钨丝是从美国运来的。解放后，美国侵略者企图以封锁来扼杀我国工业的发展。但是，他们想错了。我们中国工人阶级是具有高度的智慧和创造力的，在我们面前没有克服不了的困难。在今年第四届国庆节前夕，第一支用国产钨丝制成的灯泡，终于放出了光芒。同时试制成功的还有电热丝、双金属片、碳化钨拉丝模等。沈阳电工十四厂听到我厂试制双金属片成功，立刻派人来上海要我厂制造一些双金属片给他们，据说他们的部分任务是给鞍钢做的，需要的很迫切。我们小组里的同志听说如此，在设备不完备的情况下，竭力做好间接支援鞍钢的工作。有时连吃饭的时间也挤出来干，只要是支援鞍钢，我们就有了劲头。
    最后，我祝你组同志们的身体健康。
                    国营上海灯泡厂　王云广
