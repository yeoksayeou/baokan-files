    Greeting the Issuance of the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds

    Following discussions on the issuance of the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds at the enlarged 51st session of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the 196th session of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, the 29th session of the Central People's Government Committee approved and promulgated the "Regulations on the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds," and the Government Administration Council simultaneously issued the "Instructions on the Issuance of the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds." This is an important measure taken by the Central People's Government to accelerate China's economic construction.

    The bonds being issued this time are called the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds. Their significance is very clear, as stated in the instructions of the Government Administration Council: "1954 is the second year of our country's First Five-Year Plan, which is being implemented during the transition period to gradually realize national socialist industrialization and the gradual realization of socialist transformation. Completing this year's plan is a major event related to the prosperity of the country and the happiness of the people, which the people of the whole country will be very concerned about and actively strive for. However, the funds required for economic construction are substantial and must be raised from all aspects to be guaranteed. In addition to the income of state-owned enterprises and various taxes, mobilizing the people of the whole country to subscribe to bonds with a portion of their surplus and potentially saveable funds to support national construction is not only an important and regular method in economic terms for raising the funds needed for socialist industrialization, but also an expression of patriotism in political terms."

    At present, the people of the whole country are full of hope and confidence in a happy socialist life, striving to achieve this great goal, and first striving to realize the country's First Five-Year Plan. The people of the whole country understand that the realization of the First Five-Year Plan will further promote the rise of our national economic life and lay a solid foundation for our country's socialist industrialization and the gradual realization of socialist transformation. However, to realize national socialist industrialization and carry out national economic construction, a large amount of construction funds are required. The main source of such a huge amount of funds is of course the income of state-owned enterprises and various taxes. Taking 1953 as an example, these two types of income accounted for more than 90 percent of the state's net fiscal revenue that year, which constituted the main part of the funds supplied for national construction. However, in addition to this, the state should also raise funds from other aspects according to needs and possibilities, to fully guarantee the needs of national economic construction. Therefore, the state's issuance of bonds, mobilizing the people to use their savings and potentially saveable funds to participate in national construction, has become one of the important and regular methods for raising the funds needed for socialist industrialization. During the period of socialist construction, the Soviet Union issued bonds many times. They regarded the issuance of bonds as an important financial subsidy source for economic and cultural construction, and they regarded the issuance of bonds as a major economic and political task of the state. This is because the issuance of bonds has positive significance for both the country and the people. It can concentrate the scattered funds in the hands of the people and use them for major national construction projects, thereby gradually increasing the welfare of the people. It can turn a part of the idle money in the hands of the people into useful funds. At the same time, it also has the nature of savings, becoming an effective method for the state to organize people's savings. After the people purchase bonds, they can periodically recover interest and principal. This time, the total amount of our national construction bonds is six trillion yuan, and the total amount of principal and interest to be paid by the state will be seven trillion three hundred and twenty billion yuan. In addition to recovering the principal upon maturity, subscribers can also share the fruits of national construction and obtain some interest income. This shows that the issuance of bonds based on the needs of national construction and the interests of the broad masses of people is only beneficial and not harmful.

    The issuance of these bonds is also based on the increasing rise of our national economy and the general improvement of the people's political consciousness. In the past four years, our country has completed the task of restoring the economy and has begun to carry out planned economic construction. Industrial and agricultural production has developed. In 1952, the output of major industrial and agricultural products mostly exceeded the highest annual output in history. In 1953, it is expected that the production of many industrial and agricultural products will overfulfill the plan. With the development of production, the people's living standards have generally improved, and the people's purchasing power has generally increased. In the past four years, through various democratic social reform movements and the victory of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, the people's political consciousness has been greatly improved, and the idea of patriotism has taken root in the hearts of the people. Therefore, the people support all major political and economic measures of the country. Moreover, the total amount of bonds issued this time is only six trillion yuan, which is not a large amount. According to the instructions of the Government Administration Council, of these six trillion yuan, it is planned to sell one trillion yuan to workers, staff members, cadres of government agencies and organizations, and cultural and educational workers; 1.8 trillion yuan in rural areas; and 3.2 trillion yuan to private industrial and commercial enterprises in cities (including shareholders and capital agents), private parties in public-private joint ventures, and other urban residents. This distribution is reasonable. We know that the broad masses of workers and staff have always stood at the forefront of the struggle in the country's various political and economic struggles and have no income tax burden. The number of farmers is the largest, and the allocated amount is not large, especially after recently receiving a broad and in-depth education on the general line, they have ardent expectations for the country's socialist industrialization. The production and operation of private and public-private joint ventures across the country have grown and developed considerably in recent years. It is a patriotic expression for industrialists, businessmen, and other urban residents to lend a portion of their surplus funds and savings to the state for investment in production, which can not only avoid idle funds but also support national economic construction. At the same time, this bond sales adopts a more convenient method, that is, after a one-time subscription, the payment can be made in one lump sum or in installments, and can be extended to before the end of November 1954. Therefore, the amount of bonds this time is within the capacity of people of all strata; the bond subscription is bound to be completed smoothly and may even be overfulfilled.

    By comparing the issuance of construction bonds this time with the issuance of the People's Victory Commodity Bonds in 1950, we can also see many new and favorable conditions. In 1950, when the country had just been founded, it was still in a difficult period of financial and economic difficulty, and the people's lives were also in difficulty. However, as soon as the state's decision to issue bonds was announced, the people immediately responded to the call and actively subscribed, and the promotion and subscription work was successfully completed. Today, it is no longer the difficult situation of 1950. At that time, prices were not fully stable, and the calculation of bonds had to adopt the method of commodity units. Today, prices have been completely stable, and with the further development of the national economy, financial prices will definitely stabilize, and the use of Renminbi as the unit of calculation can fully protect the interests of subscribers. In short, all aspects of the current conditions are more favorable than in 1950. Therefore, it can be affirmed that after the issuance of bonds begins this time, the broad masses of people will once again show the great spirit of loving the motherland, respond to the call of the state, and set off a wave of enthusiastic bond subscriptions.

    However, it must also be pointed out that the key to the successful completion of the bond sales work lies in whether sufficient work has been done. Party committees and people's governments at all levels must attach importance to the leadership of this work and should not be careless and negligent because the number is not large; they must not think that the work can be completed as usual without doing any work because the masses are actively subscribing. Therefore, before and during the bond issuance, sufficient propaganda and mobilization must be done to make the people thoroughly understand the significance of issuing bonds and its benefits for both the public and the private, so that they are happy to subscribe. Attention must be paid to the rationality and appropriateness of the distribution of numbers among various regions and sectors. For those regions and aspects with larger people's income, more can be sold; while for those regions and aspects with less income, less can be sold, or even exempted from sales. The subscription range should not be too small and should be based on the possibilities and willingness of the purchasers. The regulations in the Government Administration Council's instructions that active elements "should not subscribe too much to avoid affecting their lives" and that "workers, peasants, public education personnel, and people from other sectors who are unable to purchase should not be forced to purchase" must be observed. A strong bond sales committee must be organized, and democratic consultations and mobilization of the broad masses of people must be carried out through this organization. The people can be mobilized to subscribe only after all preparatory work has been done. The subscription time should not be too long to avoid affecting other work.

    We believe that the broad masses of people and state staff already have the experience of issuing bonds in 1950. As long as the preparatory work is done sufficiently, the bond sales work this time will definitely be completed smoothly. Under the brilliant light of the general line of the transition period, in order to build our great motherland, the people of the whole country will greet the issuance of the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds with joy and excitement.

### 迎接一九五四年国家经济建设公债的发行

    迎接一九五四年国家经济建设公债的发行
    在中国人民政协全国委员会常务委员会扩大的第五十一次会议和中央人民政府政务院第一九六次政务会议讨论了关于发行一九五四年国家经济建设公债的问题之后，中央人民政府委员会第二十九次会议批准和公布了“一九五四年国家经济建设公债条例”，并由政务院同时发出“关于发行一九五四年国家经济建设公债的指示”。这是中央人民政府为加速我国经济建设而采取的一个重要措施。
    这次发行的公债，叫做一九五四年国家经济建设公债，它的意义非常清楚，就如政务院的指示所说的：“一九五四年是我国在过渡时期为逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化和逐步实现社会主义改造而实行的第一个五年建设计划的第二年，完成这一年度的计划，是关系国家富强和人民幸福的一件大事，全国人民必将十分关怀和积极努力。但经济建设所需资金，数目较巨，必须从各方面筹集，始能有所保证。除国营企业收入和各项税收以外，动员全国人民，以其一部分多余的和可能节约的资金，认购公债，支援国家的建设，不仅在经济上是筹集社会主义工业化所需资金的重要的和经常的方法之一，而且在政治上也是一种爱国主义的表现。”
    现在，全国人民都满怀着对于社会主义幸福生活的希望和信心，为实现这一伟大的目标而奋斗，并首先为实现国家第一个五年建设计划而奋斗。全国人民懂得，第一个五年计划的实现，将进一步促进我国国民经济生活的上升，将为我们国家的社会主义工业化和逐步实现社会主义改造的事业打下稳固的基础。但是，要实现国家的社会主义工业化，要进行国家的经济建设，必须有大量的建设资金。这样数额巨大的资金的来源，主要的当然是依靠国营企业的收入和各项税收。以一九五三年为例，这两种收入约占国家财政当年纯收入的百分之九十以上，它们构成了供应国家建设资金的主要部分。但是，除此以外，国家还应该根据需要和可能从其他各方面筹集资金，才能充分保证国家经济建设的需要。因此，国家发行公债，动员人民以其积蓄和可能节约的资金，参加国家的建设，就成为筹集社会主义工业化所需资金的重要的和经常的方法之一。苏联在社会主义建设时期，曾多次发行公债，他们把发行公债看作经济和文化建设的重要的财政补助源泉，他们把发行公债当作国家的一项重大的经济和政治工作。这是因为公债的发行，对于国家和人民都具有积极的意义，它可以把分散在人民手中的零星的资金，集中起来用于国家重大的建设事业，从而一步一步地增进人民的福利；它可以把人民手中一部分闲置的金钱，变为有用的资金；同时，它还具有储蓄的性质，成为国家组织人民储蓄的有效方法，人民购买公债之后，可以按期地收回利息和本金。这次我们的国家建设公债总额为六万亿元，国家还本付息总数将为七万三千二百亿元，认购人除到期收回本金外，还可以分享国家建设的果实，得到若干利息收入。这就说明基于国家建设的需要和广大人民的利益而发行的公债，是只有好处而决无坏处的。
    这次公债的发行，又是在我国国民经济日益上升和人民政治觉悟普遍提高的基础之上的。四年以来，我国已经完成了恢复经济的任务，开始进行有计划的经济建设，工农业生产都已有了发展。一九五二年工农业主要产品的产量，绝大部分已超过了历史上的最高年产量；一九五三年预计，又将有许多工农业产品的生产超额完成计划。随着生产的发展，人民的生活已普遍有所改善，人民的购买力，已普遍有所提高。四年以来，经过各种民主社会改革运动，经过抗美援朝斗争的胜利，人民的政治觉悟已大大提高，爱国主义的思想已深入人心，因此，人民对于国家各项重大的政治和经济措施，莫不拥护和支持。而且，这次公债发行的总额只有六万亿元，为数不大。根据政务院的指示，这六万亿元，预定在工人、店员、政府机关团体干部以及文化教育工作人员中推销一万亿元；在农村中，推销一万八千亿元；向城市的私营工商业（包括股东及资方代理人）、公私合营的私方及其他城市居民，推销三万二千亿元。这样分配是合理的。我们知道，广大职工群众，在国家的各种政治和经济斗争中，从来都是站在斗争的前列，且无所得税负担；农民人数最多，分配数量不大，特别是最近受到了一次广泛而深入的总路线的教育，他们对于国家社会主义工业化抱有热烈的期望；全国私营和公私合营工商业的生产和经营，几年来都有了相当的增长和发展，工商业者和其他城市居民把多余的一部分资金和积蓄，借给国家，投入生产，不但可以避免资金的闲置，而且是支持国家经济建设的爱国主义的表现。同时，这次推销公债，又采取了较为便利的办法，即在一次认购之后，可以一次缴款，也可以分期缴款，并可延长至一九五四年十一月底以前缴款完毕。因此，这次公债的数额，对于各阶层人民，都是力能胜任的；公债的认购，是一定能够顺利完成并且可能超额完成的。
    把这次发行建设公债和一九五○年发行人民胜利折实公债时的情形作比较，我们还可以看到许多新的有利条件。在一九五○年，那时开国不久还处在财政经济的困难时期，人民生活也处在困难当中，但是国家发行公债的决定一经公布，人民就立即响应号召，踊跃认购，顺利地完成了推销和认购工作；而今天，则早已不是一九五○年那样的困难情况。那时物价还未完全稳定，公债的计算，还不能不采用折实单位的办法，而今天，物价早已完全稳定，并且随着国民经济的更加发展，金融物价必将确定地稳定下去，采用人民币为计算单位，已可以充分保障认购人的利益。总之，现时的各方面条件都比一九五○年为有利。因此，可以肯定，在这次公债开始发行后，广大人民必将再一次表现出热爱祖国的伟大精神，响应国家的号召，掀起一个踊跃认购公债的热潮。
    但是，也必须指出，公债推销工作的能否顺利完成，重要的关键，还在于是否进行了充分的工作。各级党委和人民政府，必须重视这一工作的领导，不应认为数目不大而大意疏忽；不可因为群众踊跃认购就以为可以不做工作而能照例完成。因此，在公债发行以前和发行当中，必须做好充分的宣传动员，使人民彻底了解发行公债的意义及其对公对私的利益，从而乐于认购。必须注意各地各界间数字分配的合理和适当，对于那些人民收入较大的地区和方面，可以多推销一些；而对于那些收入较少的地区和方面，则可以少推销一些，甚至免予推销。认购面不能太小，而且要按照购买者的可能和自愿。政务院指示中对于积极分子“不必认购过多，以免影响生活”，“对于无力购买之工人、农民、公教人员及其他各界人民，不得强令购买”的规定，必须得到遵守。必须组织有力的公债推销委员会，经过这一组织进行民主协商和动员广大人民。必须在一切准备工作做好之后，才可以开始发动人民认购。认购时间不必过长，以免影响其他工作。
    我们相信，广大人民和国家工作人员都已有了
  一九五○年发行公债的经验，只要准备工作做得充分，这次公债的推销工作，一定能够顺利完成。在过渡时期总路线的光辉照耀之下，为了建设我们伟大的祖国，全国人民必将以欢欣鼓舞的心情来迎接一九五四年国家经济建设公债的发行。
