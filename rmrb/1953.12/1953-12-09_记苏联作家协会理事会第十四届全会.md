    Editor's Note: The full texts of the reports by Konstantin Simonov and Alexander Fadeyev at the Fourteenth Plenary Session of the Board of the Soviet Writers' Union, introduced in this article, have been published in the "Literary Gazette" Nos. 21 and 22 of this year, respectively. These two reports offer detailed and insightful discussions on inheriting literary heritage, creating positive characters, dramatic writing techniques, dramatic criticism, and some issues in the work of the Soviet Writers' Union. They have very practical guiding significance for all aspects of our literary and artistic circles.
    The Fourteenth Plenary Session of the Board of the Soviet Writers' Union, which was of great significance, was held from October 21st to 24th at the "Cinema House" in Moscow. The meeting was attended by writers from Moscow and Leningrad, representatives of writers' organizations from various union republics, autonomous republics, border regions, and provinces, as well as critics and theater and film workers.
    The plenary session discussed the situation and tasks of Soviet dramatic creation, and decided to entrust the Secretariat of the Board of the Writers' Union with studying the materials of the Fourteenth Plenary Session, and formulating the necessary measures to revitalize the work of playwrights' organizations in Moscow, various republics, border regions, and provinces, mainly to directly assist playwrights in improving their writing skills.
    The plenary session decided to convene the Second All-Union Congress of Soviet Writers in the autumn of 1954 (the First All-Union Congress of Soviet Writers was held in 1934), and entrusted the Presidium to prepare proposals regarding the agenda of the Congress, the generation and quota of representatives, and preparation methods within two months. The plenary session decided to specifically discuss the preparations for the Congress at the Fifteenth Plenary Session in January and February 1954.
    In order to strengthen collective leadership, the plenary session elected the Presidium and the Secretariat. The plenary session unanimously elected Alexander Fadeyev as Chairman of the Board of the Soviet Writers' Union. A Presidium composed of thirty-six people and a Secretariat composed of A. Surkov (First Secretary), Konstantin Simonov, Nikolai Tikhonov, Leonid Leonov, Nikolai Gribachev, and Boris Polevoy, among others, were also elected.
      The development of Soviet dramatic creation was the focus of discussion at this plenary session of the Board of the Soviet Writers' Union. There are now 497 theaters in the Soviet Union, performing in 39 national languages. There are 350,000 amateur theater groups in the Soviet Union, with more than 5 million participants. They performed 91 programs in 1952 alone, attracting 90 million viewers. In the Soviet Union, drama is recognized as a powerful means of conducting communist education. However, the situation of dramatic creation in recent years has been unsatisfactory, and it has been criticized as a backward link in the Soviet literary front. The Soviet Communist Party is particularly concerned about this issue. The Soviet Communist Party helped Soviet writers criticize the harmful theory of no-conflict, taught them to study the Marxist viewpoint in depth, and called for the development of creations in various genres, especially satirical works. Thus, under the encouragement of the Party and the efforts of the writers, Soviet dramatic creation has made significant progress in the year since the 19th National Congress of the Soviet Communist Party. The strength of dramatic creation and criticism has been strengthened, and many new plays on modern themes have emerged. The performances in this theatrical season are richer than in the previous season. However, in terms of objective needs and the strong strength possessed by the Soviet literary front, Soviet dramatic creation should have greater development. The plenary session of the Board of the Soviet Writers' Union conducted extensive discussions on how to develop Soviet dramatic creation.
    Konstantin Simonov delivered a report on "Problems in the Development of Soviet Dramatic Creation" at the meeting.
    Simonov reported on the recent active phenomena in Soviet dramatic creation and criticism. Simonov believes that the plays created by Soviet playwrights in the twenty years from 1920 to 1940, which truly reflect social life, should be cherished. He said that it is necessary to deeply study and inherit the classical heritage, and learn from the dramatic models of the Soviet nationalities.
    Simonov pointed out that writers must remember the teachings of the Party and truthfully depict life. He criticized the views held by some critics and writers in recent years; this view believes that since life is expressed from the development of life, it is better to depict people as they should become, rather than depict them as they are now. He said: "The people have not wanted to make such demands on literature, and their demands on literature have always remained the same: to write about life truthfully. And truthfully and dialectically expressing the life we have now will naturally foreshadow the seeds of the future and tomorrow, which are produced in our present every moment. What is seeing the future? Does this mean that when a writer depicts a picture of modern society, he should inferentially put in the advanced figures he thinks should be there? Of course not. Seeing the future means acutely seeing the advanced phenomena and advanced figures that actually exist today, paying more attention to depicting these figures, foreseeing the characteristics and qualities of people in communist society in the character and actions of these figures, and expressing the entire ideal beauty of their achievements without losing their living nature at all, and at the same time, creating living and working models in artistic images for people to imitate. This is seeing the future."
    Simonov talked in detail about the techniques of creating the character of positive characters. He said that dramatic creation as a whole should take writing positive characters as its central task, but it should not mechanically require every playwright to focus primarily on writing positive characters. He said that the problem of creating the character of positive characters is a principle of dramatic writing technique. To artistically express the decisive role of the working masses in historical development depends on creating the distinct character of positive characters. The more distinct the character of the positive characters, the more distinct the image of the people expressed in them.
    Simonov criticized the view that pays attention to the position of the characters but not the character of the characters. This view believes that playwrights must put characters who are indispensable in terms of the importance of their positions into their plays. He said: There is absolutely no need for a playwright to put a chairman of the factory committee next to a secretary of the Party committee. Because you can bring the secretary of the Party committee onto the stage, but still fail to show the role played by the Party organization in the Soviet collective. Playwrights do not have to use the organizational chart of the organs where their characters are located as a guide when creating positive characters. His only necessary guide is to strive to write a true picture of our social life through the development and conflict of certain or many characters. There is no need for characters on the stage who have no characteristics, no character, and only exist as positions. Positions do not show people, but people show positions. Soviet dramatic creation has created rich positive characters. The main characteristics of these images are their positive character, not their positive functions. These characters do not stand outside the battle, but always stand deep in the battle. The scenes of how they fight constitute their beauty as human beings.
    Simonov opposed confusing positive characters with ideal characters. He said: The concept of ideal characters should not be substituted for the concept of positive characters under any circumstances. "When a playwright starts writing a play, he affirms his ideals within a large scope with the entire process of the play's development and the actions of his positive characters. But this has nothing in common with idealizing his characters. These are living, earthly characters who struggle, think, sometimes waver, sometimes make mistakes, but ultimately make the right decisions." Regarding writing about the wavering and doubts of positive characters, Simonov said: Positive characters do not necessarily waver and doubt before making the right decisions. Considering is a way of human spiritual life, and positive characters also have the right to this way of spiritual life like others.
    Simonov asked playwrights to pay attention to depicting the spiritual outlook of positive characters. He criticized some playwrights for paying too much attention to finding special and extraordinary positive characters and ignoring the infinitely rich positive types, characters, and human characteristics that exist in reality. He believes that plays cannot simply solve problems. "Yes, positive characters must correctly solve the fundamental problems touched upon in the play in the ending. The play is written to solve these problems. But the audience wants to see how the characters achieve this solution. If they see the solution to the difficulties, then they want to see how the characters achieve it with difficulty." He said: "Playwrights sometimes superficially understand the actions of characters as only direct actions, and do not show the spiritual movements generated in the characters' hearts. But if you give the characters only actions, while keeping their spirit, intellect, and emotions still, then you cannot think that you have created an active character image."
    Simonov pointed out that creating the character of party workers who are alive and loved by the audience is an urgent task of Soviet dramatic creation. He criticized three mistakes. The first mistake is inverting cause and effect. "When some of our playwrights try to create a positive image of party workers, they confuse the concept of cause and effect: they think that a person is good because he is a secretary. But the opposite is true. A person becomes a secretary because he is a good person and a good party member." Therefore, these writers rarely care about creating the character of a person to prove that a person with such a character is worthy of being a leader of the masses; these playwrights only care about the character's actions conforming to his position. The second mistake is writing party workers as judges of other people's faults. "Often, the secretaries in our plays rarely appear as workers who roll up their sleeves to do their party work, thinking, arguing, making correct decisions, sometimes making mistakes, and being responsible to the party for their every action; but most often they appear as judges of other people's mistakes, ...it even seems as if he is specially waiting for the people around him to make mistakes so that he can calmly consider their strengths and weaknesses and make his own correct final judgment. And in these plays, as a rule, he is not responsible for not preventing people's mistakes in time." The third mistake is not writing party workers as ordinary positive characters but as ideal characters.
    Simonov talked about how to handle the struggle between positive and negative characters. He said: "The task of creating true artistic images of positive characters and the task of waging a relentless struggle against all the dark sides of reality are not only not contradictory to each other, but dialectically complement each other, constituting two aspects of the same task of truthfully expressing our social life." Positive and negative characters are most clearly revealed in their struggle with each other. But do not make the mistakes in some recent plays: the struggle is very sharp at the beginning, but at the decisive moment, the negative characters suddenly admit defeat. It seems that the negative characters only care about how to quickly surrender to the positive characters and help the positive characters win well. These playwrights are eager to force the negative characters to quickly tell the positive characters all their negative essence. Doing so not only destroys the naturalness of the negative characters' behavior, but also makes the positive characters clumsy.
    Simonov talked about the vision and skills of dramatic criticism. He pointed out that dramatic criticism has made some progress in the past year and a half due to the emergence of many new critics and the participation of actors, directors, and playwrights. The kind of instructive and formulaic essays have been reduced, and lively essays with artistic analysis that raise sharp questions are increasing. He believes that the biggest shortcoming that still exists in dramatic criticism is that it does not pay enough attention to the artistic characteristics and diversity of dramatic literature. He said: "Dramatic criticism should be the promoter of the courage of dramatic creation and the defender of the artistic characteristics of new creations. Soviet art needs stage literature of the most diverse genres—from tragedy to comedy with song and dance." He criticized the decline of comedy not long ago because critics made inappropriate demands on comedy in order to avoid exposing and satirizing the negative phenomena in life. He pointed out that the works of this genre should be criticized according to the laws of a certain style. He asked dramatic criticism to cherish the cadres of dramatic creation. He said: It is possible and should be very strict to criticize a certain playwright's serious mistakes, but do not suspect everything about the playwright without sufficient grounds, and do not create an atmosphere of public opinion that distrusts him. Care about the fate of the playwright.
    Simonov said in the conclusion of the report: "We will make every effort to gloriously answer the demands of the Party and the demands of the people. We will answer the questions about life, work, friendship, love, and life that move the Soviet people with our plays."
    At this plenary session, Alexander Fadeyev delivered an important speech on "The Work of the Soviet Writers' Union."
    Fadeyev first talked about the Party's education of writers. He said: For many years after the war, the Party has done a great job in the political and artistic ideological education of writers. The education and training work carried out by the Party in all aspects is to enable Soviet writers to learn to recognize the new socialist life that is constantly developing, and to deeply understand the life of the people with the love that artists of the new world can and should have; it is to enable writers to carry out persistent and tireless study in terms of ideology and art, and to learn from the great models of Russian and world classical literature, the literature of all Soviet nationalities, and the models produced by Soviet literature in the past thirty-six years, so as to improve the level of writers' artistic skills. The Party takes the Soviet people who are building a socialist society as the center of literary attention. The Party taught and teaches writers to understand and truthfully describe the leading role of the Party as an advanced social force in the various lives and struggles of the Soviet people. The Party taught and teaches writers to recognize the various ideological enemies on the road of Soviet literary development. The Party educated and educated writers in the spirit of Soviet patriotism and internationalism. Under the leadership of the Party, Soviet writers have waged and are waging struggles against various kinds of bourgeois nationalism, cosmopolitanism, worship of modern bourgeois false civilization, and the influence of formalism. We should remember these educations given by the Party in ideology and art, so as not to repeat old mistakes in new forms.
    Fadeyev then talked about the problems existing in the work of the Writers' Union.
    Fadeyev believes that the due conclusions should be drawn from the criticism of the Writers' Union's work by the society in recent years. He said: Many excellent writers and active members of creation of all nationalities have the right to participate in the leadership work of the Writers' Union, but they have not fully participated in the leadership of the social and artistic ideological life of the Writers' Union. The achievements of the work of various creative organizations largely depend on the situation of attracting active members among all writers to participate in leadership work. Now, there are ninety outstanding writers, including writers of Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia, Uzbekistan, Latvia and other nationalities, who make up the Board of the Soviet Writers' Union. But the total number of active members of creation of the Writers' Union is much larger. But in Moscow, in the union republics and autonomous republics, and in Leningrad, only a relatively narrow circle of writers actually work in the leading organs of the Writers' Union. This is not due to the lack of enthusiasm of the writers. Soviet writers actively participate in the social activities of defending world peace and domestic politics, are connected with factories, construction sites, collective farms, schools, and research institutions, and participate in the work of the Soviet press. Their essays and commentaries have played a huge role in Soviet literary life. Therefore, the shortcoming lies in the Writers' Union, which has not absorbed the vast number of writers to participate in its public activities, especially in the leadership work of the various organs of the Union.
    Fadeyev analyzed three reasons for this shortcoming:
    First, in the ideological and artistic education of writers, when a certain writer's work is criticized by society, the leading organs of the Writers' Union only pay attention to pointing out the writer's mistakes, but do not pay attention to their task of continuing to work with this writer after the mistake is discussed, and welcoming his progress after the writer corrects the mistake. Fadeyev cited the criticism of Katayev's work "For Soviet Power" as an example. The mistake of this novel was the focus of discussion at the Thirteenth Plenary Session of the Board of the Writers' Union. The author admitted his mistakes and rewrote his work. The Writers' Union did not express its attitude towards the rewritten work, thus seeming to avoid acknowledging Katayev's creative achievements. Fadeyev also cited Kazakevich's novel "Heart of a Friend." This novel had some ideological mistakes and was criticized by the Presidium of the Writers' Union. But the mistakes of this work cannot bury the entire value of this work. But no publisher, including the Soviet Writer Publishing House, published this work. Fadeyev said: "Criticism and self-criticism is the main method of educating Soviet writers ideologically and artistically. But criticizing mistakes and shortcomings is only the necessary first step. After this, we should also conduct comradely and thoughtful work with the writer, leading the writer to new creative victories."
    Second, there are still phenomena of lacking specialization and egalitarianism in the attitude towards writers. Fadeyev pointed out that writers should become masters of their own business, study life, and truthfully describe life. Describing the character of people, the relationship of people, and the conflicts of people is the task of art. The artistic talent to describe character cannot be obtained overnight. Because of this, we must value and cherish the true masters in art. Fadeyev pointed out that many exemplary examples are of great significance in the development of artistic talent. It is impossible to become a master in literature without deeply, regularly, and long-term studying the great models in past art. He said: "You can hold any high position in the Writers' Union, but without deeply studying and understanding the models of classical writers, it is impossible to become even a tiny serious writer." We should cherish art masters with a responsible attitude and educate young writers to learn from their examples. Fadeyev proposed that the older generation of writers should write with young comrades, and should work with them separately, carefully, and strictly. There are many very artistically talented people among young writers. They are still "medium" writers today, but they are constantly studying life and constantly working, and have become well-known and beloved writers. Fadeyev said: "Young writers also require separate work to be carried out on them, in which the love of their talents and the uncompromising strict requirements are combined. Whether this work is carried out on young or old writers, if there is a lack of love for individual talents, a lack of necessary strict requirements, and only knowing how to work according to the principles of 'lack of specialization' and 'egalitarianism', then it can only bring harm."
    Third, the reason why some writers hold a cold attitude towards their organization is that the organizations of the Writers' Unions in Moscow and various republics often do not adopt the method of broad masses participating in the joint solution of creative problems, but instead replace it with administrative bureaucracy. Fadeyev made a detailed and insightful discussion on this. He said: "As an all-Soviet organization, the Writers' Union naturally cannot avoid dealing with many organizational and administrative issues in many issues of its work, and it cannot ignore material and life issues. But undoubtedly, ideological education and artistic education issues, creative issues, and the issues in writers' literary works should become the focus of attention of all organizations of the Writers' Union. When we violate the most basic democratic principles in our organizational life, when the Secretariat of the Writers' Union replaces the broader and more prestigious organ elected by writers - the Presidium of the Writers' Union, when we have not convened a plenary session of the Board of the Writers' Union for many years, this is not right. It has long been the time to propose convening the All-Soviet Writers' Congress."
    Fadeyev talked about the issue of collective leadership in the Writers' Union. He said: "Our Writers' Union needs real collective leadership. All publications, publishing houses, and creative committees of the Union need real committee system in their work and to eliminate any marks of command and administrative methods. Only in this way can the broad group of Soviet writers feel that they are the masters of the Union, and the work of the Writers' Union and its affiliated organs can be raised to an unprecedented height. We must remember: the significance of the work of the Writers' Union is not to judge and judge in the jury seat, but to promote the creation of excellent artistic works. The significance of creative discussion and research is not in the discussion and research, but in how it conforms to the main purpose of creating excellent artistic works. For this reason, it should be emphasized again and again that the leadership of the Union and other organs, especially its publication organs, should use great strength to conduct individual work with each writer. But we should cherish the writer's time. According to the meaning of this profession, the writer must write, and must also have time to arm himself with the knowledge of life and conduct multifaceted study. And true poetry—if regardless of genre, then literary works are also poetry—requires time to ponder and consider."
    Fadeyev also criticized some writers' contempt for the Writers' Union. He said: "These writers should have understood long ago that in our organized society, many of the writer's difficulties are inseparable from the difficulties of his own organization. It is much more beneficial to give a part of your energy to the Writers' Union than to spend a lot of energy on feeling uncomfortable later."

    记苏联作家协会理事会第十四届全会
    李何  李楠
    编者按：本文所介绍的康·西蒙诺夫和亚·法捷耶夫在苏联作家协会理事会第十四届全会上的报告全文已分别在本年第二十一号、第二十二号“文艺报”上发表。这两篇报告对继承文学遗产、创造正面人物、戏剧创作技巧、戏剧批评以及苏联作家协会工作中的一些问题，都作了详细精辟的论述，对于我国文艺界的各方面工作，都有很现实的指导意义。
    苏联作家协会理事会在十月二十一日到二十四日在莫斯科“电影之家”举行了具有重要意义的第十四届全会。参加会议的有：莫斯科、列宁格勒的作家，各加盟共和国、自治共和国、边疆、州的作家组织的代表和批评家、戏剧电影工作者。
    全会讨论了苏联戏剧创作的情况和任务，决定了委托作家协会理事会书记处研究第十四届全会的材料，作出为实际所必需的办法，来活跃莫斯科、各共和国、各边疆、各州的剧作家组织的工作，主要是直接帮助剧作家提高他们的创作技巧。
    全会决定了在一九五四年秋季召开苏联作家第二次全国代表大会（苏联作家第一次代表大会是在
  一九三四年举行的），并且委托主席团在两个月内准备好关于代表大会的议事日程、代表的产生和定额，筹备的办法等提案，全会决定了在一九五四年
  一、二月间第十五届全会上具体讨论代表大会的准备问题。
    为了加强集体领导，全会选出了主席团和书记处。全会一致选举亚·法捷耶夫为苏联作家协会理事会主席。并选出了由三十六人组成的主席团和由阿·苏尔科夫（第一书记）、康·西蒙诺夫、尼·吉洪诺夫、列·列昂诺夫、尼·格里巴切夫和鲍·波列沃伊等人组成的书记处。
      苏联戏剧创作的发展问题，是苏联作家协会理事会这届全会讨论的重点。苏联全国现在有四百九十七个剧院，以三十九种民族语言演出。苏联现在有三十五万业余戏剧小组，参加工作者在五百万以上，它们在一九五二年一年内演出了九十一个节目，吸引了九千万观众。在苏联，戏剧被公认为进行共产主义教育的有力手段。但是最近几年来戏剧创作的情况是不能令人满意的，被批评为苏联文学阵线中落后的一环。苏联共产党特别关心这个问题。苏联共产党帮助苏联文学家批评了有害的无冲突论，教导他们深入学习马克思主义的观点，号召发展各种体裁的创作，特别是讽刺作品。这样，在党的鼓励下，在作家的努力下，从苏联共产党第十九次代表大会以来的一年中，苏联戏剧创作有了显著的进步。戏剧的创作和批评的力量加强了，出现了不少以现代问题为主题的新剧本，这一个戏剧季节演出的，比前一个季节要丰富。但是就客观的需要和苏联文学阵线拥有的雄厚的力量来说，苏联的戏剧创作应该有更大的发展。苏联作家协会理事会本届全会就怎样发展苏联戏剧创作的问题进行了广泛的讨论。
    康·西蒙诺夫在会上作了“苏联戏剧创作发展中的问题”的报告。
    西蒙诺夫报告最近苏联戏剧创作和批评的活跃现象。西蒙诺夫认为，苏联剧作家在一九二○年到一九四○年的二十年间创作的、真实地反映社会生活的剧本，应当爱惜。他说，必须深刻地研究和承受古典的遗产，向苏维埃各民族的剧作典范学习。
    西蒙诺夫指出，作家必须记取党的教导，真实地描写生活。他批评最近几年来一些批评家和作家所怀的见解；这种见解认为，既然是从生活的发展中表现生活，那么，与其把人们描写成他们现在的这个样子，不如把他们描写成他们应当变成的那个样子。他说：“人民并没有想向文学提出这样的要求，他们对文学的要求向来不变：真实地写生活。而真实地辩证地表现我们现有的那样的生活，他自会预示着，未来的、明天的种子，每时每刻在我们今天产生。什么是看到未来呢？这是否说，作家在描写现代社会的图画时候，应该推论式地把他认为应有的先进人物放进去呢？自然，不。看到未来，这就是说，在今天锐敏地看到实际上存在的先进的现象，先进的人物，多多注意描写这些人物，在这些人物的性格和行动中预见共产主义社会的人的特点和品质，并且在表现他们的功绩之全部理想的美时，丝毫不使他们失掉活的本性，同时，在艺术的形象中创造生活的和工作的榜样，供人仿效的榜样。这就是看到未来。”
    西蒙诺夫详细地谈论创造正面人物底性格的技巧。他说，戏剧创作整个说来要把写正面人物作为中心任务，但是不应该机械地要求每个剧作家都把主要注意力放在写正面人物上。他说，创造正面人物的性格问题，是戏剧创作技巧的原则问题。用艺术手腕表现劳动群众在历史发展中的决定作用，这要靠创造正面人物的鲜明性格。正面人物的性格越鲜明，他们身上所表现的人民的形象也越鲜明。
    西蒙诺夫批评那种注意人物的职位而不注意人物的性格的观点，这种观点认为剧作家必须把就职位重要性来讲是不可少的人物，都放进自己的剧本中去。他说：剧作家绝无必要写一个党委书记就非得放一个工厂委员会主席在他旁边不可。因为你尽可以把党委书记拉上舞台，而仍然不能表明党组织在苏维埃人的集体中所起的作用。剧作家在创造正面人物时，不必以他的人物所在的机关编制表为指南。他的必要指南只有一个：努力经过某些或许多性格的发展和冲突，写出一幅我们社会生活的真实图景。舞台上不需要没有特色、没有性格、只作为职位而存在的人物。职位显不出人，人却显得出职位。苏联戏剧创作创造过丰富的正面人物。这些形象的主要特点，是他们正面的性格，而不是正面的职能。这些人物不站在战斗之外，总是站在战斗深处。他们怎样斗争的场面，构成他们为人之美。
    西蒙诺夫反对把正面人物与理想人物混为一谈。他说：在任何情况下不应该把理想的人物的概念代替正面人物的概念。“剧作家在动手写剧本时，在很大的范围以内以剧本发展的全部进程，以自己的正面人物的行动肯定自己的理想。但是这和把自己的人物理想化毫无共同之处。这是活的、地上的人物，他们斗争着、思想着、有时动摇，有时犯错误，可是终归作出正确的决定。”关于写正面人物的动摇和怀疑，西蒙诺夫说：正面人物在采取正确决定以前不一定动摇和怀疑。考虑，这是人的精神生活的一种方式，正面人物和别人一样也享有这种精神生活方式的权利。
    西蒙诺夫要求剧作家注意描写正面人物的精神面貌。他批评有些剧作家太注意寻找特殊的、非常的正面人物而忽视现实中存在的、无限丰富的正面的典型、性格、人的特点。他认为剧本不能简单地解决问题。“是的，正面人物在结局中要正确地解决剧本所接触的那些根本问题，剧本就是为解决这些问题而写的。但观众希望看到人物怎样达到这个解决，如果见到困难的解决，那么想看到人物怎样困难地达到它。”他说：“剧作家有时表面地理解人物的行动为只是直接的举动，而不表现人物内心所产生的精神动作。但是如果给予人物只是举动，而同时保持他的精神、理智、情感于不动，那么不能认为你创造了活动的人物形象。”
    西蒙诺夫指出，创造活的、为观众所喜爱的党的工作者的性格，是苏联戏剧创作的迫切任务。他批评三种错误。第一种错误是颠倒因果。“我们有些剧作家在试图创造党的工作者的正面形象时，混淆了因果概念：他们认为，人是好的，因为他是书记。而实际正相反。人成为书记，因为他是好人、好党员。”因此，这些作家很少关心创造人的性格，以证明具有这样性格的人配做群众领袖；这些剧作家只关心人物的行动符合于他的职位。第二种错误是把党的工作者写成别人过失的审判员。“往往，我们剧本中书记很少出现为这样的工作者，他卷起袖子做自己的党的工作，思想着，辩论着，作着正确的决定，有时犯错误，为自己的每个行动对党负责；而最多最常出现为别人错误的审判者，……甚至好像他专门等待周围的人们犯错误，以便他可以冷静地斟酌他们的长短，作出自己无错误的最后判决。而在这些剧本中，照例，他对于自己没有及时防止人们的错误不负任何责任。”第三种错误是，不把党的工作者写成普通的正面人物而写成理想的人物。
    西蒙诺夫谈到怎样处理正反面人物的斗争。他说：“创作正面人物的真正艺术形象的任务，和同现实的一切阴暗面作无情斗争的任务，不但彼此不矛盾，反而辩证地互相补充，构成真实地表现我们社会生活的同一任务的两方面。”正面性格和反面性格在彼此斗争中最鲜明地揭开。但不要犯最近一些剧本中的错误：开始时斗争很尖锐，在决定关头反面人物忽然认输，似乎反面人物只关心怎样赶快向正面人物缴械和帮助正面人物很好地取胜。这些剧作家急于迫使反面人物赶快向正面人物说出自己全部的反面本质。这样做，不仅破坏了反面人物行为的自然，而且弄拙了正面人物。
    西蒙诺夫谈到戏剧批评的眼界和技巧。他指出最近一年半来由于许多新的批评家的出现和演员、导演、剧作家的参加，戏剧批评有些进展。那种教训式和以公式来套创作的论文已经减少，而活泼的、有艺术分析的、提出尖锐问题的论文在增加。他认为戏剧批评中还存在的最大缺点是，不够注意艺术的特征和戏剧文学的多样性。他说：“戏剧批评应当是戏剧创作勇气的宣扬者，新的创作的艺术特征的捍卫者。苏联的艺术需要最多样体裁的舞台文学——从悲剧到杂带歌舞的喜剧。”他批评了因为避免揭露和讽刺生活中反面的现象，因为批评家对喜剧提出不适当的要求而使喜剧不久以前有某些衰退现象。他指出要根据一定文体的规律来批评这个体裁的作品。他要求戏剧批评爱护戏剧创作的干部。他说：可以也应该很严格地批评某某剧作家的严重错误，但是不要无充足根据而怀疑剧作家的一切，不要造成舆论不信任他的气氛。要关心剧作家的命运。
    西蒙诺夫在报告的结语中说：“我们将作一切努力以光荣地回答党的要求，人民的要求。我们将以自己的剧本回答那些感动苏联人的关于生命、工作、友谊、爱情、生活诸问题。”
    在这届全会上，亚·法捷耶夫发表了“关于苏联作家协会的工作”的重要演说。
    法捷耶夫首先讲到党对作家的教育。他说：党在战后许多年来，对作家不论在政治教育上，在艺术思想教育上，都作了巨大的工作。党所进行的各方面的教育培养工作，就是为了使苏联作家们学会认识到在不断发展中的社会主义新生活，并以新世界艺术家所可能和应有的热爱去深刻理解人民的生活；就是为了使作家在思想与艺术方面进行顽强的、不知疲倦的学习，从俄罗斯和世界的古典文学、苏联各民族的文学的伟大典范中去学习，从苏联文学三十六年来所产生的典范中去学习，以提高作家的艺术技巧的水平。党把建设社会主义社会的苏维埃人作为文学注意的中心。党教导了和教导着作家了解并真实地描写党在苏联人民的各种生活和斗争中作为先进社会力量的领导作用。党教导了和教导着作家认清在苏联文学发展道路上的各种思想敌人。党以苏维埃爱国主义和国际主义的精神教育了和教育着作家。苏联作家在党的领导下，向各种各样的资产阶级的民族主义、世界主义、崇拜现代资产阶级的假文明、以及形式主义的影响进行了和进行着斗争。应该记着党在思想和艺术上所给予的这些教育，不致再在新形式下重犯老错误。
    法捷耶夫接着谈到作家协会工作中存在的问题。
    法捷耶夫认为应该从近几年来社会对作家协会工作的批评中得出应有的结论。他说：许多优秀的作家，各民族从事创作的积极分子有权利参加作家协会的领导工作，但他们远未充分参与作家协会的社会的和艺术思想生活的领导。各种创作组织的工作的成就，在很大的程度上决定于吸引所有作家中的积极分子参加领导工作的情形。现在，有九十个杰出的作家，包括俄罗斯、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、格鲁吉亚、乌兹别克、拉脱维亚及其他民族的作家，组成苏联作家协会理事会。但作家协会全部从事创作的积极分子还要广大得多。但是在莫斯科、在各加盟共和国与自治共和国、在列宁格勒，作家协会的领导机关实际只有比较窄小的作家圈子在工作。这并不是由于作家的积极性不够。苏联的作家积极参加保卫世界和平和国内政治的社会活动，联系着工厂、建设工地、集体农庄、学校、研究机关，参与苏联报刊的工作，他们写的论文和评论对于苏联的文学生活起了巨大的作用。所以缺点是在于作家协会，不曾吸收广大的作家参加自己的公共活动，特别是参加协会各机构的领导工作。
    法捷耶夫分析造成这种缺点的三个原因：
    第一、在对作家的思想和艺术教育方面，当某作家的作品遭受到社会的批评时，作家协会的各领导机构仅注意到指责作家的错误，而没有注意到自己的任务在于，在错误讨论完毕之后继续向这个作家进行工作，并且当作家改正了错误之后，欢迎他的进步。法捷耶夫举了对卡达耶夫的作品“拥护苏维埃政权”的批评为例。这部小说的错误是第十三届作家协会理事会全体会议的讨论中心。作者承认了自己的错误，并改写了自己的作品。作家协会没有对改写后的作品表示态度，这样似乎避开了承认卡达耶夫创作上的成就。法捷耶夫又举了卡查克维奇的小说“朋友的心”。这部小说有一些思想上的错误，遭受了作家协会主席团的批评。但这部作品的错误不能埋没这部作品的整个价值。可是没有一个出版社，连苏联作家出版社在内，出版这部作品。法捷耶夫说：“批评和自我批评是从思想上和艺术上教育苏联作家的主要方法。但是批评错误和缺点，这只是必需的第一步，在这以后，还应对作家进行同志般的深思熟虑的工作，把作家引导到新的创作胜利。”
    第二、在对待作家的态度上，还残留着缺少专责制和平均主义的现象。法捷耶夫指出，作家应该成为本身业务的匠师，研究生活，真实地描写生活。描写人的性格、人的关系和人的冲突，是艺术的任务。描写性格的艺术才能不是一朝一夕所能获得的，正因如此，所以必须重视和爱护艺术中的真正匠师。法捷耶夫指出在发展艺术才能上，许多值得学习的典范极有意义。没有深刻地、经常地、长期地研究过去艺术中的伟大典范，是不可能成为文学中的匠师的。他说：“可以在作家协会内居于随便怎么高的职位，但不深刻研究与领会古典作家的典范，要成为那怕极为微小的严肃的作家也是不可能的。”应该以负责的态度爱惜艺术大师，教育青年作家学习他们的榜样。法捷耶夫提出：年长一代的作家应该和年青的同志一道写作，应该单独地、爱护地、要求严格地和他们一道工作。在青年作家中有许多极有艺术才能的人，他们今天还是“中等的”作家，但他们不断研究生活，不断工作，变成了人所共知、所喜的作家。法捷耶夫说：“青年作家同样要求对他们进行单独的工作，在这种工作中对他们才能的爱和毫不容情的严格的要求结合起来。不管对年青还是年长的作家进行这种工作时，如果缺乏对个人才能的爱，缺乏必需的严格要求，只知按‘缺少专责制’和‘平均主义’的原则工作，那么只能带来害处。”
    第三、一部分作家对自己的组织持冷淡态度的原因，是莫斯科和各共和国的作家协会的组织常常不采取广大群众参加共同解决创作问题的方法，却代之以行政官僚主义的方法。法捷耶夫对此作了详细精辟的论述，他说：“作为全苏组织的作家协会自然不可能不在自己工作的许多问题中处理许多有关组织的和行政性质的问题，而且也不能不管物质和生活中的问题。但是无疑的，思想教育和艺术教育问题、创作问题、作家的文学作品中的问题应该成为作家协会所有组织注意的中心。当我们违背我们组织生活中最基本的民主原则的时候，当作家协会的书记处以自己代替了更广泛和更有威望的由作家选举的机关——作家协会主席团的时候，当我们已有很多年来未召开作家协会理事会全会的时候，这是不对的。早已是提出召开全苏作家代表大会的时候了。”
    法捷耶夫谈到作家协会中的集体领导问题，他说：“我们作家协会需要真正的集体领导。协会的所有刊物、出版社和创作委员会都需要工作中的真正的委员制和消灭任何命令和行政方式的标记。只有如此，苏联作家的广大集团才会感觉到自己是协会的主人，作家协会和它所属各机关的工作才能提升到前所未有的高度。必须记着：作家协会的工作意义不是在陪审官席上裁判裁判，而是促进优秀艺术作品的创作。创作的讨论和研究的意义，不在于讨论研究，而在于它如何符合创作优秀艺术作品这
  一主要目的。正因为如此，应该一次再次强调指出，协会的领导和其他机构，特别是它的刊物机关，应该用很大的力量对每一个作家进行个别工作。但是应当爱惜作家的时间，作家按照这种职业的意义，要写作，也必须有时间以生活的知识武装自己，进行多方面的学习。而且真正的诗——如果不论体裁，那么文艺作品也是诗——是要求有时间来深思、考虑的。”
    法捷耶夫同时也批评了某些作家对作家协会的轻视态度。他说：“这些文学家们早就应该了解，在我们有组织的社会中，作家的许多困难是和自己组织的困难分不开的，把自己的精力分一部分给作家协会，比以后花费许多精力在心情难受上去，要有益得多。”  十一月五日于莫斯科
