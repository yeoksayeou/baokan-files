    The state-owned Harbin Electric Meter and Instrument Factory, which will begin construction next year, is actively preparing for the construction work. This factory, the largest and most sophisticated electric meter and instrument factory in our country, is one of the key construction projects of China's machinery industry. Once completed, it will mainly produce complete sets of automobile electric meters, as well as various electric meters for power generation and transformation equipment, and potentiometers that China could not manufacture in the past. This factory is designed with the assistance of the Soviet Union. At present, the preliminary design, technical design, and construction drawings have been largely translated. Based on the drawings and actual construction conditions, the 1954 basic construction plan and material plan for the electric meter and instrument factory have been drafted, and orders for foreign building materials have begun. The construction projects of the electric meter and instrument factory that will begin next year include three factory buildings, dormitories, a steam supply system, power lines, compressed air lines, water supply and drainage systems, roads, and other construction items. Many of these construction projects are special, precise, and complex. Relevant construction management cadres and technicians have already studied the drawings and are preparing to study special types of work in winter training. The temporary projects (canteen, dormitory), water source, electricity, and transportation required for construction next year have all been prepared this year. The preliminary plan for the construction organization design for next year has been determined. Plans for labor, tools, equipment, financial costs, etc., are also being accelerated. The first quarter's building materials, cement, and wood, pre-allocated by the central government, have been successively transported. The four million red bricks, tiles, stones, sand, and other materials required for the project next year, balanced locally, have also begun to be transported to the site.
    While preparing for construction, the Harbin Electric Meter and Instrument Factory has begun to prepare the technical force needed for future production. A technical worker training class has been opened at the Acheng Instrument Factory, preparing to send twenty-five workers, cadres, and technicians to study in the Soviet Union, and also sending the forty university students and technical school students sent by the central government to the Acheng Instrument Factory for practical study. In addition, the cadres and technicians sent by the central government and the technical cadres supported by the Acheng Instrument Factory have arrived at the factory site one after another, and will soon participate in the construction work, learning and familiarizing themselves with the work from scratch. In this way, when the construction project is completed, there will be sufficient strength to switch to production.

    国营哈尔滨电表仪器厂积极进行建厂准备
    将在明年开工兴建的我国最大最精密的电表仪器厂——国营哈尔滨电表仪器厂，正在积极进行建厂施工的准备工作。这个厂是我国机械工业建设重点工程之一。建成后主要生产全套汽车电表，还可以生产发电、变电设备的各种电表，以及中国过去不能制造的电位差计等。这个厂是由苏联帮助我国设计的。现在初步设计、技术设计、施工图等图纸已大体上翻译完毕。根据图纸与施工实际条件，电表仪器厂一九五四年基本建设计划与材料计划已经拟定，国外建筑材料已开始订货。电表仪器厂明年开工兴建的工程包括三个厂房、宿舍、蒸汽供应系统、电力线路、空气压缩线路、上下水道、道路等项建筑。这些建筑工程当中有很多特殊工程精密而又复杂。现有关施工的管理干部与技术人员已进行了图纸学习，并准备在冬季训练中进行特殊工种的学习。明年施工所需要的临时工程（食堂、宿舍），水源、电力、交通等今年均已准备妥善。明年施工组织设计的初步方案已经确定。劳动力、工具设备，财务成本等计划也在加紧进行。中央预拨的第一季度建筑材料水泥、木材已陆续运到。地方平衡的明年工程所需的四百万块红砖及瓦、石、砂等材料也开始向现场搬运。
    哈尔滨电表仪器厂与施工准备工作同时，已开始准备将来生产所需要的技术力量。在阿城仪表厂开办了一个技术工人训练班，准备派二十五个工人、干部、技术人员到苏联学习，并把中央派去的四十个大学生与技术学校的学生，也派到阿城仪表厂进行实际学习。此外，中央派的干部与技术人员及阿城仪表厂支援的技术干部已先后到达厂地，即将参加建厂工作，从头学习和熟悉工作。这样待建厂工程结束时就可以有足够力量转入生产。
