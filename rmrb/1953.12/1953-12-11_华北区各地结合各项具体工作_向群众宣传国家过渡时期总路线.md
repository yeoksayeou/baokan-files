North China Region Combines Various Specific Tasks to Publicize the General Line for the Transition Period to the Masses

The North China Region has universally held three-level cadre meetings to convey the general line and general tasks of the state during the transition period to all cadres above the township level in the region. Now, North China is widely launching publicity and education on the general line among the masses, combining it with various tasks.

The publicity of the general line has continued in North China for two months. Leading Party and government cadres of the CCP Central Committee North China Bureau, the North China Administrative Committee, and the three provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, and Suiyuan, as well as the two cities of Beijing and Tianjin, have successively convened special meetings and repeatedly delivered reports. In addition to conveying it to the cadres of the North China level organs, Liu Lantao, Third Secretary of the CCP Central Committee North China Bureau, also went to Baoding, Shijiazhuang, and other places to convey the general line of the state during the transition period to more than 5,000 organ cadres. Since mid-November, counties throughout the region have successively held expanded meetings of three-level cadres from the county, district, and township. The meetings in Hebei and Shanxi counties ended at the end of November. Beijing and Tianjin have conducted intensive publicity among people from all walks of life. On the basis of the universal study of the general line by cadres, the region will form a strong propaganda team composed of nearly ten thousand reporters and propagandists to go deep into factories, mines, and villages to publicize the general line to the people of the region. At the expanded meetings of three-level cadres held in various counties, the method of comparison was generally used to educate cadres on the two different development paths of socialism and capitalism, making everyone clearly realize that it is necessary to overcome the spontaneous forces of capitalism in the countryside by organizing mutual aid and cooperation.

The three-level cadre expansion meetings in various counties enabled the cadres to learn how to combine current tasks to publicize the general line. That is, cadres must first talk about the general line, and then combine current specific tasks and policies, with discussions and inspections, and repeatedly conduct publicity. In the masses, it is necessary to cultivate a large number of backbones, and adopt various methods such as small-scale seminars, family visits, and individual talks, to inspire the masses to think about the past, compare the present, and look to the future, and positively answer the questions raised by the masses, so that the publicity and education of the general line can gradually become universal and in-depth.

After the general line was publicized to the masses in various places, it greatly promoted various tasks. The production increase and economy campaigns in factories and mines have entered a new climax. More than seventy factories and mines in North China had completed the state's production plan ahead of schedule in November. Factories and mines that have completed the plan ahead of schedule are adding tasks; factories and mines that have not completed the plan are also mobilizing workers to strive to complete the plan. At the three-level meetings in various counties, tens of millions of Party members and cadres volunteered to sell surplus grain to the state to support industrial construction. For example, in Laozhuangzi Village, Wulitun Township, Zunhua County, because the general line was publicized in depth, the task of grain procurement was completed more than doubled in more than ten days, and the work of mutual aid and cooperation and winter production was promoted.

    华北区各地结合各项具体工作
    向群众宣传国家过渡时期总路线
    华北区各地普遍举行了三级干部会议，向全区乡级以上干部传达了国家在过渡时期的总路线和总任务。现在，华北各地正结合各项工作在群众中广泛展开总路线的宣传教育工作。
    关于总路线的宣传已在华北全区持续了两月之久。中共中央华北局、华北行政委员会和河北、山西、绥远三省以及北京、天津两市的党政领导干部都先后召集专门会议反复作了报告。中共中央华北局第三书记刘澜涛除向华北一级机关干部传达外，又到保定、石家庄等地，向五千多机关干部传达了国家在过渡时期的总路线。从十一月中旬起，全区各县又相继召开县、区、乡三级干部扩大会议。河北、山西各县的会议已在十一月底结束。北京、天津两市已在各界人民中进行了突击性的宣传。全区将在干部普遍学习总路线的基础上，由近万的报告员、宣传员组成一支强大的宣传队伍，深入到工厂、矿山、乡村，向全区人民宣传总路线。在各县召开的三级干部扩大会议上，一般都采用了对比的方法向干部进行了社会主义和资本主义两条不同发展道路的教育使大家清楚地认识到：必须以互助合作组织起来的办法克服农村中的资本主义的自发势力。
    各县三级干部扩大会议，使干部学会了结合当前任务宣传总路线的方法。这就是在干部中要先讲总路线，然后结合当前具体任务和政策，有讨论有检查，反复进行宣传。在群众中要大量培养骨干，采用小型座谈、家庭访问、个别座谈等多种方式，启发群众想过去、比现在、看将来，并正面解答群众提出的问题，使总路线的宣传教育逐步作到普遍和深入。
    各地向群众宣传总路线后，大大推动了各项工作。工厂、矿山中的增产节约竞赛已进入了一个新的高潮。华北区十一月份已有七十多个厂矿先后提前完成了国家的生产计划。提前完成计划的厂矿正在追加任务；没有完成计划的厂矿也在发动职工争取完成计划。在各县三级会议上，有成千万的党员、干部自报将余粮卖给国家，支援工业建设。如遵化县五里屯乡老庄子村，因为深入宣传了总路线，在十多天当中，就超过计划一倍多完成了粮食收购任务，并推动了互助合作与冬季生产工作。
