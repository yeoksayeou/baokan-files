Accuse the Whole World
Professor of Internal Medicine Zhang Xiaoqian

The repeated exposure of the U.S. imperialists violating international conventions and cruelly and brutally mistreating our captured personnel in Korea is already known. Now, as a medical worker, I will briefly present some of the facts I saw during the health check-ups of the returned wounded and sick captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers, so that the people of the whole country and the people of the world can further recognize the hideous face of U.S. imperialism and severely condemn the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism. Even four months after the signing of the armistice agreement, the insidious U.S. imperialists are still painstakingly undermining our side's explanation work and directly directing special agents to persecute our captured personnel now under the supervision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. In order to promptly stop these new atrocities, the exposure of U.S. evidence is especially necessary.

Details regarding the health of our returned wounded and sick captured personnel and the medical atrocities committed by the U.S. military against them will be presented in an official communique, and I will not repeat them here. I will only present a few figures and simple facts to illustrate everything. Among the thousands of returned wounded and sick captured personnel, more than 90 percent of the internal medicine diseases were chronic respiratory diseases, of which almost half were pulmonary tuberculosis, and about three-quarters were active pulmonary tuberculosis; the remaining chronic respiratory diseases were mostly severe and difficult to recover from. The total of tuberculous and non-tuberculous chronic respiratory diseases accounted for almost one-third (32.4 percent) of all returned wounded and sick captured personnel. These figures are of particular significance in analyzing the crimes of the U.S. side.

When this group of wounded and sick captured personnel first returned, they were all sallow and emaciated, showing signs of serious illness. Many had lost limbs, and the vast majority were disabled (the disabled among the wounded reached 72 percent). These situations clearly show that the U.S. military doctors not only failed to fulfill their due responsibilities but also caused many medical errors and atrocities, tormenting and harming our captured personnel. From the perspective of medical workers, this is unimaginable and should be severely condemned.

After in-depth examination and research, we have fully confirmed that the main factors causing the diseases and disabilities of the returned wounded and sick captured personnel were the inhumane treatment they suffered in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps. The U.S. side completely violated the Geneva Convention on the treatment of prisoners of war and subjected the prisoners to extremely inhumane treatment. During their detention, our captured personnel did not have enough to eat to satisfy their hunger, enough clothing to cover their bodies, or housing to protect them from the cold and heat, or from the wind and rain. The prisoner-of-war camps were not only practically equivalent to filthy, crowded, humid, cold, and dark prisons, but also filled with an atmosphere of terror and threat due to the rampant activities of special agents and the massacres and tortures of the U.S. military. Of course, in such a living environment, after a long period of time, no matter how strong the body was, it could not avoid the invasion of diseases; once ill, if fortunate enough to escape death, it would inevitably turn into a chronic condition.

Under the U.S. side's long-term starvation policy, our captured personnel never had a full meal. Therefore, they universally suffered from malnutrition. Not to mention the wounded and sick captured personnel, but even among the non-wounded and sick captured personnel, the prevalence of nutritional deficiencies was surprisingly high. For example, vitamin A deficiency and riboflavin deficiency reached 90 percent and 80 percent respectively, and more than 80 percent had varying degrees of anemia (i.e., hemoglobin below 12 grams per 100 ml), and many people had or had suffered from malnutrition edema. As for the significant decrease in weight, it was especially without exception. Under such adverse nutritional conditions, the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps also frequently forced captured personnel to perform labor, and often cut off the collective or individual prisoners' rations for trivial reasons, causing them to consume even more physical strength. In addition, as repeatedly exposed by various parties, the U.S. military also constantly subjected prisoners of war to various inhumane physical punishments and atrocities. We know that diseases are closely related to changes in the internal and external environment of the human body, and malnutrition and nutritional deficiencies are especially important factors in causing diseases. Vitamin A deficiency is an inducement for various respiratory diseases. Therefore, the living conditions and persecution suffered by our captured personnel in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps, including physical torture, mental oppression, chronic starvation, and long-term labor, are fully sufficient to explain why the percentage of severe chronic diseases among them would reach such a high level.

Now let us look at how the U.S. side treated the sick prisoners of war. The medical equipment and medical environment in the U.S. military prisoner-of-war camps were clearly extremely poor. Our captured personnel did not receive timely examination and correct diagnosis when they fell ill, and of course, there was even less talk of early and reasonable treatment. The U.S. military doctors' handling of war wounds not only did not conform to treatment principles but also violated humanitarianism, resulting in a large number of disabilities. Tuberculosis patients and other respiratory disease patients were mixed together, and the ward did not have isolation and disinfection equipment, undoubtedly spreading many new infections. In the so-called sanatoriums, the wounded and sick received absolutely no nursing care, and the nurses instead beat and scolded the wounded and sick. In such an environment, the patients' illnesses would naturally worsen day by day, and would turn from mild illnesses to serious illnesses, and from acute illnesses to chronic illnesses.

The atrocities committed by the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp authorities against the wounded and sick prisoners of war were extremely cruel. These atrocities included poison gas, electric shock, beatings with sticks, stabbings, and confinement. The captured personnel had already generally suffered the atrocities of the U.S. military before falling ill, thus further damaging their health and causing illnesses. They continued to suffer persecution after falling ill, so how could their conditions not become more serious? For example, among 48 cases of severe active pulmonary tuberculosis, no less than 30 cases suffered various forms of persecution after entering the sanatorium and being diagnosed with tuberculosis by U.S. military doctors, including starvation, water deprivation, and poison gas attacks; on average, each person suffered more than 2.2 persecutions, and many suffered 3 or 4 times, causing their lung disease to worsen further. This cruel treatment of severe pulmonary tuberculosis patients is unprecedented in history.

The above are the crimes of the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps found on the returned wounded and sick captured personnel, which have actually far exceeded the extent of the prisoner-of-war camp crimes of the German and Japanese fascists during World War II. Let us use these concrete pieces of evidence to expose the brutal essence of U.S. imperialism, expose the mask of U.S. imperialism, and accuse the world's people of the bloody atrocities of the U.S. military in violating the Geneva Convention, violating medical ethics, and violating humanitarianism.

    向全世界控诉
    内科教授  张孝骞
    美帝国主义违反国际公约，在朝鲜以极端残酷凶暴的行为虐待我方被俘人员，已经迭有揭发。我现在以医务工作者的身分，把这次在中国人民志愿军归来伤病被俘人员的健康检查中所看到的一些事实作一简单的陈述，使全国人民和全世界人民更认清美帝国主义的狰狞面貌，并对美帝国主义的滔天罪行加以严正的声讨。在停战协定签字已经四个多月的今日，阴险的美帝国主义还处心积虑破坏我方的解释工作，直接指挥特务迫害现在中立国遣返委员会看管中的我方被俘人员。为了及时制止这些新的暴行，美方的罪证的揭发尤其是必要的。
    关于我方归来伤病被俘人员的健康情况和美军在他们身上所施的医疗暴行，详情将有正式公报，我不拟赘述。我现在只提出几个数字和几个简单事实来说明一切。成千的归来伤病被俘人员中，所患的内科疾病百分之九十以上是慢性呼吸系病，其中几乎半数是肺结核，约四分之三是活动性肺结核；其余的慢性呼吸系病也大多数达到了严重的和不易恢复的程度。结核性和非结核性慢性呼吸系病二者合计在全体归来伤病被俘人员中差不多占三分之一（百分之三十二点四）。这些数字，从分析美方罪行来说，是有特殊意义的。
    这批伤病被俘人员在刚归来时都是面黄肌瘦，呈现重病容，他们很多缺损了肢体，绝大多数成了残废（伤员残废的就达百分之七十二）。这些情况很明显地说明，美方军医不仅没有尽到他们应尽的责任，反而造成了很多的医疗错误及暴行，折磨和伤害我方被俘人员。这从医务工作者来说是不可能想像的，是应该予以严正声讨的。
    经过了深入的检查和研究，我们完全证实了，造成归来伤病被俘人员的疾病和残废的主要因素就是他们在美方战俘营中所遭受到的非人待遇。美方彻底违反了关于战俘待遇的日内瓦公约，以极端不人道的待遇加在战俘的身上。我方被俘人员在拘留期间，吃的不能充饥，穿的不能蔽体，住的不能御寒暑、不能遮风雨，战俘营不只实际等于污秽、拥挤、潮湿、寒冷、黑暗的牢狱，而且由于特务的横行和美军的屠杀、酷刑，而充满了恐怖、威胁的气氛。当然，在这样的生活环境下，经过漫长的岁月，无论身体怎样强健，没有能免于疾病的侵袭的；一经患病，若是幸而免于牺牲，也没有不转成慢性的。
    我方被俘人员在美方的长期饥饿政策下，从来没有吃过一顿饱饭。因此，他们普遍地患着营养不良症。伤病被俘人员当然不用说，就是在非伤病被俘人员中，营养缺乏症同样是惊人的高。例如，甲种维生素缺乏和核黄素缺乏分别达百分之九十和百分之八十，百分之八十以上有不同重度的贫血（即血色素在每一百毫升十二克以下），许多人现有或患过营养不良性水肿。至于体重的显著下降尤其毫无例外。在这样恶劣的营养情况下，美方战俘营还经常强迫被俘人员服劳役，并且时常借细故断绝集体或个别战俘的口粮，使他们消耗更大量的体力。此外，如各方多次揭发的，美军还不断在战俘身上施行各种惨无人道的体罚和暴行。我们知道，疾病和人体内外环境的改变是有密切的关系的，营养不良和营养缺乏尤其是招致疾病的重要因素，甲种维生素缺乏就是各种呼吸系病的诱因。所以，我方被俘人员在美方战俘营中所受到的生活待遇和迫害，包括身体上的折磨、精神上的压迫、慢性的饥饿、长时期的劳役等，完全足以说明为什么他们中的重度慢性病百分率会达到这样的高。
    现在让我们看一看美方是怎样对待患了病的战俘的。美军战俘营中的医疗设备和医疗环境显然是异常的恶劣。我方被俘人员生病时得不到及时的检查和正确的诊断，当然更谈不到早期的和合理的治疗。美方军医处理战伤不只不符合治疗原则，而且违反人道主义，以致造成大量的残废。结核病患者和其他呼吸系病患者杂处，病室没有隔离和消毒的设备，无疑地传播了许多新的感染。在所谓休养所中，伤病员根本受不到任何护理上的照顾，护士反而打骂伤病员。在这样的环境下，伤病员的疾患自然会日趋恶化，会由轻病转成重病、由急性病转成慢性病。
    美方战俘营当局对于伤病战俘所施用的暴行，是极端残酷的。这些暴行包括毒气、电刑、棒打、刀刺、禁闭等。被俘人员在病前已经普遍受过美军的暴行，因而更损伤了健康，形成了疾患。他们在病后仍然继续遭受迫害，病况怎能不更加严重？例如，四十八例严重活动性肺结核患者中，不下三十例在进了休养所，被美方军医诊断为结核病以后，还遭受各种各样的迫害，包括断食、断水和毒气的袭击；平均每人受迫害二点二次以上，许多达三、四次；以致他们的肺病更形恶化。这种对待重度肺结核病人的残酷手段，是有史以来没有前例的。
    以上所举出的，就是在归来伤病被俘人员身上所发现的美方战俘营的罪行，它实际上已远超过了第二次世界大战期间德、日法西斯的战俘营罪行的程度。让我们用这些具体的罪证来揭发美帝国主义的残暴的实质，戳穿美帝国主义的假面具，向全世界人民控诉美军违反日内瓦公约、违反医学道德、违反人道主义的血腥暴行。
