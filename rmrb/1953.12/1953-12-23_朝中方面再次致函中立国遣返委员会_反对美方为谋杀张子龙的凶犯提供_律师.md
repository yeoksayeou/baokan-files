Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 22nd: The seven Kuomintang secret agent criminals who murdered Zhang Zilong, a captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers, under the instigation of the United States, have been arrested by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces for more than a month. Because the U.S. is attempting to provide so-called "defense lawyers" for the murderers, the trial has not yet begun. General Li Sang-cho, representative of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, sent another letter to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on the 20th, firmly opposing the U.S. providing so-called "defense lawyers" for the criminals who murdered Zhang Zilong, and urging the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to quickly provide qualified defense lawyers from India so that the trial of these murderers can begin quickly.

General Li Sang-cho pointed out that the "Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" clearly stipulates that after prisoners of war are transferred to the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the control and influence of the original detaining party must be completely removed. The U.S. directing secret agents to murder prisoners of war and prevent their repatriation is a serious violation of the "Scope of Authority." The current task of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission is to eliminate secret agents and their organizations and completely remove this terrorist control and influence. General Li Sang-cho emphasized: It must not be allowed for the instigators of the murderers to provide so-called "defense lawyers," thus legalizing their control and influence. The criminals who murdered Zhang Zilong must be severely punished.

    朝中方面再次致函中立国遣返委员会
    反对美方为谋杀张子龙的凶犯提供“律师”
    【新华社开城二十二日电】在美国指使下谋杀中国人民志愿军被俘人员张子龙的七名国民党特务凶犯，已被中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队逮捕了一个多月，由于美方企图为杀人凶犯提供所谓“辩护律师”，使审判至今未能开始。朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表李相朝将军二十日再次致函中立国遣返委员会，坚决反对美方为谋杀张子龙的凶犯提供所谓“辩护律师”，并敦促中立国遣返委员会迅速提供印度的合格的辩护律师，以便迅速开始审讯这些杀人凶犯。
    李相朝将军指出：“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”明确规定战俘移交中立国遣返委员会看管后，必须彻底解除原拘留一方的控制和影响。美方指挥特务谋杀战俘，阻止战俘遣返是对“职权范围”的严重破坏。中立国遣返委员会目前的任务是肃清特务及其组织，彻底解除这种恐怖控制与影响。李相朝将军强调指出：决不能容许杀人犯的主使者提供所谓“辩护律师”，使其控制与影响合法化。谋杀张子龙的凶犯们必须严办。
