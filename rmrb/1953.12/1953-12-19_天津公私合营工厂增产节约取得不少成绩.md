Tianjin’s joint public-private factories, under the leadership of the local Party committee and the People's Government since October, have actively launched a campaign to increase production and practice economy. Workers have shown high enthusiasm in production competitions. Workers at the New Tianjin Rubber Factory, in addition to voluntarily participating in machine maintenance, actively researched and improved product quality. The workers making inner tubes proposed a competition goal of guaranteeing 100% quality. In the New Tianjin Dyeing and Finishing Factory, the highest attendance rate in the past was 85% for the general factory and 90% for the first and second branches. Now, the general factory has reached 95.92%, and the first and second branches have reached 96.82%. Many non-direct production workers have also joined the competition. For example, cooks actively modified stove flues, and odd-job workers voluntarily arrived early and left late. Workers have also demonstrated a high degree of creativity in finding shortcuts, tapping potential, and promoting advanced experiences. Workers at the first branch of the New Tianjin Dyeing and Finishing Factory added a circulation rack to the dryer, increasing drying efficiency and raising production by 2.37%. The dyeing tanks in the second branch were idle and unattended. After workers researched and improved the machine-watching method, they changed from four people watching one widening and drying machine to three people, saving manpower and opening a pair of dyeing tanks, increasing production by 8%. The general factory learned the continuous scouring, bleaching, and dyeing method and accelerated mercerizing method from the local state-owned First and Third Printing and Dyeing Factories, saving two liang of vulcanized blue per bolt of cloth, and increasing the dyeing rate from 700 bolts of blue gabardine per day to 1,000 bolts.

Due to the efforts of the workers, the joint public-private factories have not only completed their production plans but have also exceeded their increased production plans. For example, when the Fuxing Flour Company processed wheat for the Grain Company, the flour extraction rate per hundred jin of wheat increased by 1.85 jin, creating more than 300 million yuan in wealth for the country. Many factories have also improved product quality. For example, the first-class product rate of the Da Fu Textile Factory increased from 87.5% to 88%. The first-class product rate of blue cloth at the New Tianjin Dyeing and Finishing Factory increased from 80% to 89%; in the processing of 10,000 bolts of grey cloth, the first-class product rate reached 99.27%. The increase in production also reduced costs, increased corporate profits, and increased income. According to incomplete statistics, the cost of Sanhecheng aluminum pots decreased by 3.7%, and the cost of masthead lamps decreased by 5.9%; the cost of gabardine at the New Tianjin Dyeing and Finishing Factory decreased by 5%, and the cost of gabardine at the Da Fu Textile Factory decreased by 38%. At the same time, improvements have been made in production and operation. Factories have adjusted labor organization according to different situations, mobilized workers to formulate or revise group production contracts, strengthened workshop statistics, and established group meeting systems and operating systems. The Tongyihe Machinery Factory, which was previously poorly managed, has also initially established necessary systems such as production responsibility systems and finished product inspection systems, and has begun to move towards planned production. During the campaign to increase production and practice economy, after visiting the Tianjin Safety and Hygiene Exhibition, workers in various factories generally inspected safety and hygiene equipment and made some necessary improvements. The New Tianjin Dyeing and Finishing General Factory also established safety operating procedures.

    天津公私合营工厂增产节约取得不少成绩
    天津市公私合营工厂的职工，自十月以来，在当地党委和人民政府的领导下，积极开展了增产节约运动。在生产竞赛中，职工劳动热情很高。新天津橡胶厂职工，除自动参加检修机器外，并积极研究和改进产品质量，做内胎的职工提出了保证质量百分之百的竞赛目标。新天津染整厂过去的出勤率总厂最高为百分之八十五，一、二两分厂最高为百分之九十，而现在总厂已达百分之九十五点九二，一、二分厂达百分之九十六点八二。不少非直接生产职工也投入了竞赛，如炊事员积极改装炉道，勤杂人员自动早到晚退。工人们在开展找窍门、挖潜力、推广先进经验的工作上，也表现了高度的创造精神。新天津染整厂第一分厂职工在干燥机上增添了循环架，增大了干燥效率，使生产提高了百分之二点三七；第二分厂染槽闲着无人开动，经职工研究改进了看机方法，由过去四个人看拉宽干燥机一台，改为三个人看一台，节省人力增开了染槽一对，生产提高了百分之八。总厂则学习了地方国营一、三印染厂整续炼染工作法及加速丝光燥作法，使每轴布可节省硫化蓝二两，染布率由日染蓝华达呢七百匹提高到一千匹。
    由于职工们的努力，各公私合营工厂不但完成了生产计划，而且也超额完成了增产计划。如福兴面粉公司为粮食公司加工时，每百斤小麦出粉率提高了一点八五斤，为国家多创造财富三亿余元。许多厂也提高了产品质量，如大蚨织布厂正品率由百分之八十七点五提高到百分之八十八。新天津染整厂蓝布正品率由百分之八十提高到百分之八十九；青布一万匹的加工中，正品率达到百分之九十九点二七。由于生产的提高，也降低了成本，使企业利润加大，收入增加。据不完全统计，三合成铝锅成本降低百分之三点七，桅灯成本降低百分之五点九；新天津染整厂华达呢降低百分之五，大蚨织布厂华达呢降低百分之三十八。同时在生产经营上也获得改进。各工厂都按不同情况调整了劳动组织，发动职工订立或修订了小组生产公约，加强了车间统计，建立了小组会议制度和操作制度。过去管理比较混乱的同义和机器厂，也初步建立了生产责任制、成品检查制等必要制度，并开始走向计划生产。在增产节约运动中，各厂职工参观了天津安全卫生展览会后，普遍地检查了安全卫生设备，并作了一些必要的改善，新天津染整总厂并建立了安全操作规程。
