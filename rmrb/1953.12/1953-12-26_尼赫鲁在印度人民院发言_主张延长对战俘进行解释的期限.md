Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 25th: According to the Indian News Service, Prime Minister Nehru of India stated on the 23rd in the Indian Lok Sabha during a debate on foreign affairs that the deadline for explaining to prisoners of war in Korea should be extended.

Prime Minister Nehru pointed out: The situation in Korea is one of extremely great importance. It is important because it is inherently important and is very likely to affect world peace or war.

Nehru then said: "The ninety-day (explanation period) expires today. However, during these ninety days, what was originally intended to be done has not been done, and therefore difficulties have arisen. The ninety days were for explanation work. However, the explanation work had not even started at the time it should have started. ... About twenty days passed before the explanation work began. Thus, about twenty days out of the ninety were wasted simply waiting for the construction of houses, the erection of tents, or the provision of equipment." He pointed out that after the explanation work actually began, it was repeatedly suspended. "As a result, only a small portion of the ninety days was used to carry out this explanation work. Now the deadline has passed."

Nehru said: Now, there is a demand to extend this deadline for two reasons: first, because the actual explanation work did not start on the original date, but started about twenty days later; second, because there are other difficulties that prevent the explanation work from proceeding.

Nehru said: Regarding this point, there are two views. One view is that a strict timetable has been set, and therefore, it cannot be extended by a day or a minute. The other view is that, undoubtedly, the entire purpose of this work is to obtain a certain result, rather than to adhere to some timetable on paper, and if we can obtain that result by making a certain extension (especially since the explanation period did not start at the time it should have started), it is reasonable to be lenient with the time limit.

Prime Minister Nehru then said: If a few more weeks could solve this problem more satisfactorily, then insisting on not extending the deadline "would be a very rigid, literal, and somewhat narrow interpretation."

Nehru pointed out that the fate of the prisoners of war who have not returned home must be considered by the Political Conference. He then said: "The Political Conference has not yet been convened. So, it is clear that something that is an important part of the agreement between the two commands has not happened. This is a big loophole."

Nehru believed that "if both sides reach an agreement, and difficulties arise in the implementation of that agreement, then it should obviously be considered by the relevant parties—in the current situation, the two commands—and that agreement should be changed, or a new agreement should be reached."

Prime Minister Nehru spoke about the responsibilities of the Indian Custodial Force, saying: "Now, on this issue, thirty days after—after the period of the Political Conference—followed by another thirty days, during which time, according to the agreement, the Indian Custodial Force can remain there. In fact, it has a responsibility to remain there to deal with some other issues."

Nehru believed that the Korean situation should not evolve naturally as some people imagine, and that the United Nations General Assembly should use its thoughts and wisdom as much as possible to solve this problem. Nehru also expressed hope that even at the current stage, it would be possible for both commands to reach some agreement on what to do now, either by extending the deadline a little, or by taking any other measures. He believed that the United Nations General Assembly may also convene early if necessary.

### 尼赫鲁在印度人民院发言  主张延长对战俘进行解释的期限

    尼赫鲁在印度人民院发言
    主张延长对战俘进行解释的期限
   【新华社二十五日讯】据印度新闻处新德里二十四日讯：印度总理尼赫鲁二十三日在印度人民院辩论外交问题时的发言中认为：在朝鲜对战俘的解释期限应予延长。
    尼赫鲁总理指出：朝鲜的情势是具有极大重要性的问题之一。它之所以重要是因为它在本质上就具有重要性，并且很可能影响世界的和平或战争。
    尼赫鲁接着说：“九十天（解释期）在今天就满期了。但是，在这九十天的过程中，原来打算做的事情都没有做到，因此就发生了困难。九十天是供进行解释工作用的。可是解释工作在应该开始的时间甚至还没有开始。……过了二十天左右，解释工作才开始。这样，九十天中就有二十天左右浪费在单单等候修建房舍、架设帐篷或提供设备上面了。”他指出，解释工作实际开始后又一再停顿，
  “结果，在九十天中，只有很小一部分时间是用来进行这种解释工作的。现在这个期限却过去了。”
    尼赫鲁说：现在，有人要求把这一期限加以延长，理由有二：第一，因为实际的解释工作并没有在原定日期开始，而是在二十天左右以后才开始；第二，因为还有其他困难使解释工作不能进行。
    尼赫鲁说：关于这一点，有两种看法。一种看法是：已经规定了严格的时间表，因此，不能把它延长一天或一分钟。另一种看法是：无疑地，这种工作的整个目的是要获得某种结果，而不是遵守某种纸上的时间表，如果我们作一定的延长（尤其是因为解释时期并没有在应该开始的时间开始），能获得那个结果，宽以时限是合理的。
    尼赫鲁总理接着说：如果多几星期就可以比较圆满地解决这个问题的话，那么坚持不能延长的意见“就是一种非常呆板的、死扣条文的和颇为狭隘的解释”。
    尼赫鲁指出：必须由政治会议来考虑那些没有回家的战俘的命运。他接着说：“政治会议还没有召开。所以，很明显，作为两个司令部之间的协定的重要一部分的某种事情还没有发生。这是一个大漏洞。”
    尼赫鲁认为：“如果双方成立协议，而在执行那个协议的过程中发生困难的话，那显然应当由有关的双方——在目前情况下是双方司令部——来考虑那个问题，并且更改那个协议，或者成立新的协议。”
    尼赫鲁总理谈到印度看管部队的职责时说： “现在在这个问题上，在三十天以后——政治会议期间以后——接着是另外三十天，在那段时间中，按照协议的规定，印度看管部队可以留在那里。事实上，它有责任留在那里处理其他一些问题。”
    尼赫鲁认为：朝鲜局势不应当如一些人想像的那样自然而然地演变，联合国大会应当尽可能运用它的思想和智慧来解决这个问题。尼赫鲁并且表示希望甚至在目前的阶段双方司令部都有可能在现在采取甚么做法方面取得某种协议，或者是把这个期限延长一些，或者采取其他任何办法。他认为：联合国大会必要时也可能提前开会。
