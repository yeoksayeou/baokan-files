    Fushun Steel Plant and Benxi Iron and Steel Company Should Improve Ball Bearing Steel Production

    A letter from Hao Jianqiu, Supply and Marketing Section of the Wafangdian Ball Bearing Factory: The ball bearing industry is an important link in the development of heavy industry. All machines that need to rotate require ball bearings. Therefore, the bearing industry has also been listed as a key construction project in the country's first Five-Year Plan.

    However, our factory's production encountered difficulties right from the start this year. The ball bearing steel, an important raw material for making ball bearings, is the responsibility of Fushun Steel Plant and Benxi Iron and Steel Company to supply. Starting in April this year, the supply of ball bearing steel has been failing month after month. Although we have sent special personnel to be stationed at Fushun Steel Plant and Benxi Iron and Steel Company, requesting them to deliver the goods on time, the problem has not been resolved. From January to October this year, the amount of ball bearing steel we received was 284 tons less than the actual amount put into production. In order to make up for the shortfall, we used up all the ball bearing steel left over from last year, and also used some of the waste materials left over from the past, which actually affected the quality of the products. Despite this, our factory often shut down due to lack of materials, and the entire factory's work plan could not be implemented as a result.

    We have made a statistic that in November alone, the products affected by insufficient raw materials amounted to 11,740 sets. This batch of products was originally intended to be supplied to more than 40 factories and mines (most of which are heavy industrial departments, such as Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Dalian Heavy Machinery Factory, etc.).

    According to our understanding, the current untimely supply of ball bearing steel is not due to insufficient production equipment capacity of the steel plants, but due to poor management of the steel plants, which affects production and product quality. Fushun Steel Plant has more than 800 tons of ball bearing steel stockpiled in the workshop, and it has not been checked out to this day. Benxi Steel Plant has been producing large quantities of defective products since March of this year, and it has not improved yet. And a batch of goods that they deemed qualified and had shipped to our factory were also found to be defective after inspection.

    With the development of national construction work, the country's need for ball bearings next year will greatly increase compared to this year, and our factory's need for ball bearing steel will also increase. If the situation of insufficient supply of ball bearing steel does not change, not only will our factory's production suffer losses, but also the production of many other factories and mines that need ball bearings will suffer losses. Therefore, we request Fushun Steel Plant and Benxi Iron and Steel Company to quickly find ways to improve the production situation, and to supply our factory with ball bearing steel in accordance with specifications and quantities in the future.

### 抚顺钢厂和本溪钢铁公司应该改进滚珠钢的生产情况

专栏：读者来信摘要

    抚顺钢厂和本溪钢铁公司应该改进滚珠钢的生产情况
    瓦房店滚珠轴承厂供销科郝剑秋来信：滚珠轴承工业是发展重工业的重要环节之一，凡是要运转的机器，就需要滚珠轴承。因此，在国家开始第一个五年计划建设中，轴承工业也被列为建设重点之一。
    但是我们厂的生产今年一开始就遇到困难。我们作滚珠轴承的重要原料滚珠钢，是由抚顺钢厂和本溪钢铁公司负责供应的。从今年四月开始，滚珠钢月月供应不上。我们虽然派专人驻在抚顺钢厂和本溪钢铁公司，请求他们按期交货，但问题始终没有获得解决。今年一月至十月内，我厂得到的滚珠钢比实际投入生产的尚少二百八十四吨。为了补足欠缺的部分，我们除了把去年结存的滚珠钢全部用完外，还用了一部分过去留下的废料，这实际上就影响了产品的质量。尽管这样，我厂还经常因缺料而停工，整个厂的作业计划因此无法推行。
    我们统计了一下，仅十一月份，因原料不足而受到影响的产品，就达一万一千七百四十套。这批产品本来是准备供应四十多个厂矿（大部分都是重工业部门，如鞍山钢铁公司、大连重型机器厂等）使用的。
    据我们了解，目前滚珠钢所以供应不及时，不是由于钢厂生产设备能力不够，而是由于钢厂管理不善，影响生产和产品质量。抚顺钢厂在车间积压了八百多吨滚珠钢，至今检查不出来。本溪钢厂从本年三月起，就大批生产废品，到现在还没有好转。而他们认为合格并已运到我们厂的一批货，经检查也都是废品。
    随着国家建设工作的开展，明年国家需要的滚珠轴承将比今年大为增加，我厂需要的滚珠钢也将增加。假如滚珠钢供应不足的情况再不改变，不但我厂生产要受损失，其他许多需用滚珠轴承的厂矿生产也将受到损失。因此，我们要求抚顺钢厂和本溪钢铁公司迅速设法改进生产情况，今后能按规格、按数量供应我厂滚珠钢。
