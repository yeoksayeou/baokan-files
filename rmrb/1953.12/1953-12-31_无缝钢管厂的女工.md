    Female Workers at the Seamless Steel Tube Factory
    By our reporter Zhu Bo
    
    The Seamless Steel Tube Factory has more than 140 female workers, who share the production tasks of this new type of factory with the male workers.
    
    Here, no matter which workshop you enter, you will see female workers in work clothes. Those huge roller conveyors, rows of new automatic lathes, and the heart of the factory—the huge motors in the main electrical room—are all turning under their control.
    
    Those who don't know the inside story would certainly think that these female workers were all trained in specialized technical schools, but that is not the case. Not long ago, most of them were women engaged in agricultural production in the countryside, and some were female soldiers who had been transferred from the army. Most of them had never even seen a factory before coming here.
    
    On the No. 1 operating platform of the heating furnace, seventeen-year-old female operator Ding Xiuying lightly moves the button and operating lever, making the tube blanks obediently roll from the feeder onto the rotating roller conveyor and transport them to the heating furnace. She watches the flowing tube blanks and the rising and falling lifting platform with such concentration, tension, caution, and excitement.
    
    She is the daughter of a farmer from Zhaobali Village in Haicheng County, Liaodong Province. Before January of this year, she sometimes still pestered her mother and quarreled with her younger brothers at home. No one would have thought that a few months later, she would become a worker mastering the most modern industrial technology.
    
    Last year, after hearing the news of building the steel capital of the motherland from the primary school teacher, she dreamed day and night of becoming a worker and participating in the industrial construction of the motherland. In January of this year, when she heard the news that Anshan Iron and Steel Company was recruiting workers, she firmly asked her father and mother to allow her to come to Anshan to sign up. At first, her mother did not agree, thinking that she was young and had never been out before. Fortunately, her father was an understanding person, agreed to her request, and persuaded her mother: "This is a good thing, let Xiuying go."
    
    She came to the Seamless Steel Tube Factory in mid-January. The first three months were spent studying politics, and she only started learning technology after April. Learning technology, especially such modern industrial technology as that of the Seamless Steel Tube Factory, was indeed a very serious challenge for a rural girl who had no industrial knowledge at all. She was assigned to work on the No. 1 operating platform of the heating furnace. She not only had to learn the technology on the operating platform, but also had to be familiar with the structure of the heating furnace. The first time she went to class, she couldn't understand a word. Her eyes were fixed on the various symbols on the machine diagrams, and she was anxious. She was so anxious that she couldn't sleep at night, and she secretly shed tears. However, an awakened girl will not admit defeat in the face of difficulties. This can only strengthen her will to learn technology. She concentrated more on listening to the lectures, and often seized the time to review her lessons after class, until late at night, she was still lying in bed staring at the ceiling, thinking about the lessons she had learned during the day. In this way, she slowly got the hang of it. However, when learning to actually operate the machine, new difficulties arose. On the No. 1 operating platform, there are more than a dozen buttons and operating levers, which are respectively connected to the feeder, roller conveyor, moving baffle, lifting baffle, and tipping machine. Moreover, because there are two heating furnaces, there are two sets of these machines. If you can't remember which machine each button or operating lever controls, there is no way to work. Ding Xiuying drew all these buttons and operating levers in her diary, and noted their functions and operating procedures. She practiced whenever she had time, and sometimes, even when eating, she would move her chopsticks back and forth like operating levers. In this way, after hard study and hard practice, she was able to work alone on the No. 1 operating platform.
    
    Another female worker, Gu Suwen, skillfully operates the hydraulic testing machine on the processing workshop operating platform. She is an excellent Communist Party member and an agricultural production expert.
    
    She came to the Seamless Steel Tube Factory in January of this year. At that time, the members of the mutual aid group in the village were unwilling to let her come out. She explained to the members: "This is the decision of the Party, and I must obey the Party's decision." When they parted, they challenged each other. The members proposed to strengthen the unity of the mutual aid group, increase the grain harvest, and maintain the group's honor in the whole village. Gu Suwen proposed to overcome various difficulties, work hard to learn technology, and complete the production tasks assigned to her by the state.
    
    Gu Suwen encountered many difficulties in learning technology. After coming to the factory, she learned to be a pipe coupling threading worker. A month ago, due to work needs, the Party organization transferred her to work on the hydraulic testing machine, and asked her to catch up with other workers who had been studying for a long time in a short period of time.
    
    This was indeed a very difficult task, but she was not afraid of difficulties. She recalled the scene when she led more than a dozen women who had not participated in agricultural production to learn agricultural production technology in the past. At that time, she had also encountered great difficulties, but the result of persisting in learning was that they succeeded. This time, although it was much more difficult than learning to farm, she firmly believed that under the direct guidance of Soviet experts, as long as she had the determination, she could complete the task assigned to her by the Party.
    
    She couldn't take notes, so she memorized everything by rote. If she couldn't remember the controls on the operating platform, she asked someone to draw them for her. When she returned to the dormitory, she asked her comrades to repeatedly test her on the function and usage of each button. She persisted in studying like this every day.
    
    Gu Suwen was victorious. She could work alone on the hydraulic testing machine operating platform, and she also understood the structure and performance of the machine. She said: "The first time I moved the button, I saw the machine turn as I had hoped, I couldn't believe my eyes. I was so excited that my heart was pounding. At that time, I had only one thought: don't ever ask me to leave these machines."
    
    There are also some female workers here who are already mothers. For the sake of the industrialization of the motherland, they resolutely broke away from household chores and came here to learn industrial technology.
    
    The female worker Wan Chunfang on the No. 6 operating platform of the sizing machine is one such example. She is from Liaoyang County, Liaodong Province. She has been married for six years, and her husband is a cadre of Anshan Iron and Steel Company. For six years, her heart has only been for her husband and children. Last year, the news that Anshan Iron and Steel Company was recruiting workers brought her new hope. She thought that being a female worker was better than staying at home, but she couldn't bear to leave her two children. She struggled in her mind for a long time before finally bringing it up to discuss with her husband. Her husband was very happy that she did this and encouraged her not to miss this good opportunity, and comforted her by saying: "The children can be taken care of by their grandmother, you can work with peace of mind."
    
    Wan Chunfang signed up and studied very well, but while she was studying, her one-year-old daughter Hongxia unfortunately died of acute gastroenteritis. What a heavy blow this was to a mother! After Hongxia's death, she couldn't control her emotions. During class, she would see Hongxia's lovely little face, or hear Hongxia calling her mother. Sometimes she would also think of her older child: "I wonder if Hongyi has eaten now," "Is he sleeping well at night," "He won't get sick again"! For this matter, many workers with her comforted her and persuaded her, and her husband also constantly persuaded her, "Everyone feels sorry for the death of a child, but you can't sacrifice your own future for one child." After many people's persuasion, she gradually came to her senses, she said: "Yes, even if I stay at home all the time, what can I do if the child gets sick! If this goes on, wouldn't I be learning in vain? Besides, the factory is about to start work, the machines are waiting for me to operate them, can I delay the country's construction because a child died." Her mind cleared, and with the help of her comrades, she caught up in her studies again. After the test of a comprehensive trial run, she is a relatively skilled female worker among the several female workers on the sizing machine operating platform.
    
    Now, the female workers of the Seamless Steel Tube Factory deeply feel happy because they can operate automated machines. The new type of Seamless Steel Tube Factory not only promotes the industrialization of the motherland, but also opens up a broad path for women in New China to participate in industrial construction.

    无缝钢管厂的女工
    本报记者　朱波
    无缝钢管厂共有一百四十多名女工，她们和男工一起担负着这座新型工厂的生产任务。
    在这里，不管你走进那一个工段，都会看到身穿工作服的女工。那些巨大的辊道，一排排新型的自动车床和全厂的心脏—主电室里的巨大的马达…，在她们的操纵下转动着。
    不知道内情的人，一定会认为这些女工都是从专门的技术学校培养出来的，但是，实际上却不是这样。不久以前，她们大部分人还都是农村里从事农业生产的妇女，和一些从部队上转业来的女战士。她们中间大部分人在未来这里以前还没有看见过工厂。
    在加热炉的一号操作台上，十七岁的女运转工丁秀英，轻轻地扳动着电钮和操作把，使一根一根的管胚，驯顺地从给料机上滚到转动的辊道上，运往加热炉。她注视着流动的管胚和一起一落的升降台，那么集中、紧张、谨慎而兴奋。
    她是辽东省海城县赵八里村一个农民的女儿，今年一月以前她在家里有时还向妈妈撒娇和弟弟们吵嘴，谁也不会想到几个月后，她竟是一位掌握最近代化工业技术的工人了。
    去年她从小学教师那里听到建设祖国钢都的消息后，她就日夜都在想望着做一个工人，参加祖国的工业建设。今年一月，她听到鞍山钢铁公司招收工人的消息，就坚决要求爸爸和妈妈准许她来鞍山报名。开始，她妈妈不同意，认为她年纪小，又没有出过门，幸而她爸爸是个明白人，答应了她，并说服了她妈妈：“这是好事情，叫秀英去吧。”
    她是一月中旬来到无缝钢管厂的，头三个月是学习政治，从四月份以后，才开始学技术。学习技术，特别是像无缝钢管厂这样近代化的工业技术，对一个一点工业常识都没有的农村姑娘，确是一个很严重的难关。她被分配到加热炉一号操作台上去工作，她不仅要学会操作台上的技术，还要熟悉加热炉的构造。第一次上课时，她一句都听不懂，眼睛看着机器图表上的各种符号光着急，急得夜里睡不着觉，急得偷偷地掉眼泪。但是，一个觉悟了的姑娘在困难面前是不会认输的，这只能使她学习技术的意志更坚强。她更集中思想听讲，下课后常常抓紧时间温习功课，直到深夜，她还躺在床上瞪着眼睛想着白天学的功课。这样，她才慢慢地入门了。但是，在学习实际操纵机器时，新的困难又来了。一号操作台上，有十几个电钮和操作把，它们分别联系着给料机、辊道、移动挡板、升降挡板和翻料机等。而且，因为有两个加热炉，这些机器又都有两套。如果记不清每一个电钮或操作把所操纵的机器，就没有办法工作。丁秀英把这些电钮和操作把都画在日记本子上，并注明它们的作用和操作的程序。有时间就练习，有时在吃饭时，还将筷子当操作把来回扳动着。就这样，经过苦学苦练，她能单独在一号操作台上工作了。
    另一个女工谷素文熟练地操作在加工工段水压试验机的操作台上，她是一个优秀的共产党员，又是一个农业生产的能手。
    今年一月她来无缝钢管厂工作。当时，村里互助组的组员们都不愿意她出来。她向组员们解释说：“这是党的决定，我要服从党的决定。”她们分别时还互相挑战，组员们提出一定要加强互助组的团结，提高粮食的收获量，保持住小组在全村里的荣誉，谷素文提出自己要克服各种困难，努力学习技术，完成国家给她的生产任务。
    谷素文在学习技术中间遇到了很多困难。她来厂后学的是管接手车丝工，在一个月前，因为工作需要，党组织又把她调到水压试验机去工作，而且要求她在短期内赶上其他已经学习了很久的工人。
    这的确是一个非常困难的任务，但是她没有害怕困难。她曾回忆起自己过去领着十几个没有参加过农业生产的妇女学习农业生产技术的情景，那时也是曾遇到过很大的困难，但是，坚持学习的结果她们成功了。这次，虽然比起学种地来要困难得多，但是她深信，在苏联专家的直接指导下，只要有决心，就能完成党交给自己的任务。
    她不会记笔记，就一件一件地硬记。操作台上的机关记不住，请人帮她画下来，回到宿舍里，请同志们翻来覆去地考她每个电钮的作用和使用方法，她每天都这样坚持学习。
    谷素文胜利了，她可以单独在水压试验机操作台上工作了，而且还懂得了机器的构造和性能。她说：“我第一次扳动电钮的时候，看到机器按照我所希望的那样转动了，真有点不敢相信自己的眼睛，我兴奋得心都跳了。当时只有一个想法：一辈子也别叫我离开这些机器。”
    这里还有些是已经当了母亲的女工，她们为了祖国的工业化，坚决摆脱了家务，来这里学习工业技术。
    均整机六号操作台上的女工宛春芳就是这样的一个。她是辽东省辽阳县人，结婚六年了，她的丈夫是鞍山钢铁公司的一个干部，六年来，她的心里只有她的丈夫和孩子。去年鞍山钢铁公司招收工人的消息，带给她新的希望，她想到做一个女工总比待在家里强，但是，又舍不了她的两个孩子，她为这件事情在思想上斗争了很久，最后才提出来和她丈夫商量，她丈夫非常高兴她这样做，并鼓励她不要错过这个好机会，还安慰她说：“孩子可以由祖母照顾，你可以安心地去做工。”
    宛春芳报名了，而且学习得很好，但是，正在她学习的时候，她的一周岁的小女孩洪霞得了急性肠胃炎不幸死去。这对一个作母亲的来说该是一个多么沉重的打击呵！从洪霞死后，她控制不住自己的情感，上课时，她就看见小洪霞的可爱的小脸，再不就听到小洪霞叫妈妈的声音。有时还想到她的大孩子：“不知洪仪现在吃饭了没有”“夜里睡的好不好”，“他不会再得病吧”！为这件事情，和她一起的很多工人安慰她和劝说她，她的丈夫也不断说服她，“孩子死了谁也心疼，但是也不能为一个孩子葬送自己的前途。”经过很多人的劝说，她渐渐地想开了，她说：“是呀，就是我老在家里孩子得了急病，又能怎么样呢！如果这样下去，自己不是白学了吗？再说工厂快开工了，机器等着自己去操纵，还能因为死了一个孩子，耽误了国家的建设。”她的思想清醒了，在同志们帮助下，在学习上她又赶上去了。经过全面试车的考验，她在均整机操作台上的几个女工中间，是一个比较熟练的女工。
    现在，无缝钢管厂的女工，都因为自己能够操纵自动化的机器而深深地感到幸福。新型的无缝钢管厂不仅促进了祖国的工业化，而且给新中国妇女参加工业建设开辟了一条广阔的道路。
