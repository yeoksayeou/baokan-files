Better Study Soviet Textbooks, Improve Teaching Work
Sun Jinglu, Vice President of Beijing Agricultural Mechanization College

The central link in learning from the Soviet Union to improve teaching work in universities lies in deeply studying Soviet textbooks, mastering their basic content, mastering their ideological system and the methods used. Only on the basis of fully mastering Soviet textbooks is it possible to make professional courses combine with the requirements of business production, basic courses combine with the requirements of professional courses, proceed from the students' level, and determine suitable teaching syllabuses and teaching content in accordance with the time specified in the entire teaching plan. Only on this basis can collective teaching not fail, and various advanced teaching methods (classroom discussions, course design, teaching practice, production practice, etc.) not become mere formalities. It is possible for the content to be lively.

I.

In what aspects are the advantages of Soviet textbooks manifested? Based on the experience of Beijing Agricultural Mechanization College over the past year, it is tentatively summarized in the following aspects:

First, Soviet textbooks have a high degree of political ideology. Every Soviet textbook is permeated with the idea that science and technology should serve politics, and with the ideas of patriotism and internationalism. The introductions of Soviet textbooks clearly point out the position and development direction of this science in national economic construction, as well as the party and government's policies, laws, and plans in this regard. This closely combines science and politics. For example, "General Chemistry" by Glinka, adopted by our college's agronomy major, talks about the importance of Soviet chemistry and the chemical industry in industrial production and national defense construction in the introduction, explaining the major role played by the continuous improvement of the chemical industry in improving and improving the lives of the Soviet working people. It clearly puts forward the view that chemistry serves production and the working people. On the contrary, British and American textbooks instill students with the capitalist individualistic point of view. For example, in the first chapter of the introduction to "General Chemistry" by Pauling, which was commonly used in China in the past, it said that a teacher who taught chemistry later worked for a soap company, improved production, and was promoted to research minister and deputy manager of the company. Another young chemistry teacher, because of creating an instrument for measuring acidity, organized a company to manufacture this instrument, and business was very prosperous. This clearly shows that teachers in capitalist countries are letting students become capitalists after learning chemistry, or serve capitalists.

Second, Soviet textbooks are permeated with the dialectical materialism viewpoint, and resolutely struggle against bourgeois doctrines—idealism. For example, regarding the definition of mathematics, idealists believe that mathematics is a subject that specializes in playing with abstract concepts, and the operation of mathematical symbols is freely created by human thinking and has nothing to do with practical problems. The "Mathematical Analysis Tutorial" by Berman, adopted by our college's agricultural mechanization major, refutes this point of view at the beginning, clearly pointing out that mathematics comes from practice and in turn guides practice. The author quoted Engels's paper, pointing out that this science "...is completely borrowed from the outside world, and is not purely produced from the pure thinking in the mind at all," and its object is "the spatial shapes and quantitative relationships in the real world." In terms of method, the book also pointed out that the structure of teaching materials should be formulated according to the following procedure: practice—basic concepts of analysis—properties of these concepts (theory)—calculation methods—usage—practice. The whole book is thus based on the scientific cognitive process, repeatedly educating students to use the materialist viewpoint and dialectical methods to analyze and deal with mathematical problems. Chairman Mao taught us: "There is only one true theory in the world, that is, the theory that is drawn from objective reality and proved in objective reality." Soviet textbooks meet this requirement. It can give students scientific theoretical knowledge, and can give students scientific method training in the teaching practice process.

Third, Soviet textbooks are permeated with the principles of economy and safety. Soviet teaching plans and textbooks prominently point out such principles: in the process of construction and production, the consideration of the economy of manpower and materials and the safety of equipment and personnel is paramount. "Physics Tutorial" by Dubov of the Soviet Union pointed out: the task of the entire engineering science is to promote the accuracy of understanding of nature, making it safer and more economical. In "Principles, Structure and Calculation of Agricultural Machinery" by Gruzhkov et al., it is pointed out that the economy in use must be taken into account, and the weight of agricultural machinery must be reduced as much as possible to avoid wasting fuel and horsepower. The design of Soviet agricultural machinery has entered the consideration of allowing elastic deformation of machine parts as much as possible where possible. In "Agricultural Machinery Usage" by Svirshchevsky, special emphasis is placed on fire prevention of fuel and the safety of personnel in cultivation. These fully demonstrate the views of reducing labor intensity for the working people, improving the labor environment, and protecting the safety of the working people.

Fourth, Soviet textbooks have clear purposes, combine with majors, and highlight key points. For example, "Analytical Chemistry" by Anlina, adopted by our college's agronomy major, focuses on introducing the parts related to agricultural science, while maintaining the systematic nature of analytical chemistry. Ammonium, potassium, sodium, barium, magnesium, aluminum, iron, manganese and other ions that are often encountered in agriculture, this textbook focuses on repeated analysis experiments, which ensures the students' proficiency in operating skills; lead, mercury, copper, arsenite and other general descriptions are made; tungsten, tin, antimony, cobalt and other ions that are not very related to agricultural chemistry are simplified; silicate is a very important ion commonly used in agricultural science, which is not available in general analytical chemistry books, and this textbook adds it. Soviet textbooks, whether professional courses or basic courses, have clear purposes, thus ensuring and strengthening the study of each major, which is obviously much better than the blind textbooks of capitalist countries that are common to different majors and waste a lot of time in learning but cannot solve practical problems.

Fifth, Soviet textbooks have a complete system, rigorous theory, clear organization, and are inspiring. In pointing out the scope of this science, some basic definitions, and historical knowledge, "Principles of Institutions and Machines" by Yaldopolayevsky of the Soviet Union divides the content of the whole book into four parts: institution construction, institution kinematics, institution dynamics, and machine dynamics. When explaining the construction of institutions, all modern practical institution systems are systematically collected, integrated, and classified, and then studied and analyzed. First, analyze the motion pair and motion chain which are the basic factors constituting the institution. For example, the types, composition, and degrees of freedom of the motion pair are analyzed in detail in this book, and the construction law is derived, which returns to guide the design of the motion pair and motion chain. Then, based on the motion chain, the nature of the institution construction is studied, and the dependence law between its construction and activity is derived, which returns to guide the design of the institution construction. The British and American mechanism textbooks commonly used in the past only include institution construction and institution kinematics, and do not talk about institution dynamics and machine dynamics, which destroys the complete system of the science of mechanism principle; the British and American textbooks do not deeply study the institution construction, and do not analyze the motion pair and its degrees of freedom, the institution construction and its activity, so it cannot form a theoretical system. The steps adopted by Yaldopolayevsky from collecting examples, abstract analysis, deriving formulas, and returning to guide the design are clearly organized and can inspire students to think.

Sixth, Soviet textbooks have rich content. Each textbook introduces the basic laws of the science and the latest achievements of the science. Whether it is mathematics, physics, mechanics, mechanical principles, or tractor science and agricultural machinery, the content of Soviet textbooks cannot be compared with that of British and American textbooks. For example, in agricultural machinery, whether it is "Agricultural Machinery" by Davidson, which is the most widely used in British and American textbooks, or "Farm Ranch and Plantation Mechanics" by Turner and Johnson, which was published most recently (1948), it starts with a simple introduction to engineering materials and mechanical parts, and then explains the types, brands, structures, adjustments, maintenance, and repairs of various agricultural machinery, which actually becomes the instruction manual for various machinery on the market. Soviet textbooks, such as "Agricultural Machinery" by Ledoshniev or "Theoretical Structure and Calculation of Agricultural Machinery" by Kruzkov et al., theoretically analyze the working parts and standard parts of the main types of agricultural machinery—mechanical analysis of the forces acting on the agricultural machinery itself during the working process, mechanism analysis, analysis of the physical and mechanical properties changes acting on the processing object (soil, crops, etc.)—to guide the design and use of agricultural machinery. The reason why Soviet agricultural machinery science has such a high theoretical level is that the design and use of Soviet agricultural machinery occupies a leading position in the world, whether in theoretical or practical technical aspects. Soviet agricultural machinery textbooks just introduce the basic and latest knowledge of these theories and practices.

II.

Beijing Agricultural Mechanization College has made certain achievements in studying Soviet textbooks over the past year. But in general, there are still two tendencies: one is the tendency of conservatism, not being humble enough and not being active enough in studying Soviet textbooks, being satisfied with superficial and formal learning, and not being willing to study in depth and carefully. Some teachers, when they first started studying Soviet textbooks, did not seriously and humbly study its spirit and essence and appreciate its advantages, but had different degrees of ideological resistance. For example, some teachers said: "A horse has two hundred and five bones. The American horse is like this, and the Soviet horse is also like this. The American textbook says this, and the Soviet textbook also says this. There is no big difference; for example, in the unit of dairy cow feed, the unit in Scandinavia is one catty of oats, and the unit in the Soviet Union is one catty of barley. Animal husbandry in Scandinavia is very developed, and the Soviet Union may still be learning from them." As a result, they came to this wrong conclusion: it is possible to refer to some Soviet textbooks and supplement some new materials, but it is not necessary to teach Soviet textbooks. What's more, China has its special circumstances, and we should "combine with China's reality," and so on. This kind of thinking is a major obstacle to studying Soviet textbooks.

The other is the idea of rashness, and what is more prominent is blindly carrying Soviet textbooks with excessive eagerness. Some of our teachers want to complete the teaching reform in a blitz, so there is such a phenomenon: hastily translating textbooks, and before there is time to study the textbooks seriously, they quickly use these textbooks. After teaching a few lessons, they find that this textbook is not completely applicable. For example, our college adopted Berman's "Mathematical Analysis Tutorial" like this. The teaching and research group decided to adopt it without even having time to read it, let alone study whether its content is suitable for our major, whether teachers can understand and teach it, whether students can understand it, whether the time is appropriate, etc. As a result, the introduction and the first chapter were taught for more than five weeks, exceeding the planned time by more than double. Not only did the teachers feel strenuous, but the students also had opinions, and the entire teaching progress was disrupted. The teaching syllabus had to be revised again and again, and the textbooks behind had to be forcibly compressed. In the end, it was still impossible to cope with it, so we had to adapt the lecture notes, which greatly affected the teaching effect.

In addition, there are also biases in learning methods. At present, there are still many teachers who stop the work of studying Soviet textbooks at the stage of rote memorization of books. They have not been able to combine with the major to do some necessary verification calculations, experiments, internships, or go to relevant production sites to observe and see, increase perceptual knowledge, and deeply understand and think, resulting in empty content in class, playing with some dogmas, and not being of great help to students. Some teachers do not pay enough attention to the study of the ideological system, systematic arrangement, and methods used in the entire textbook, and do not deeply appreciate the advantages of the textbook as a guiding principle for teaching. These methods that deviate from reality affect our effect of studying Soviet textbooks.

III.

In the process of learning from the Soviet Union and improving teaching, some problems and difficulties will inevitably be encountered. Therefore, we are required to correct our learning attitude and develop a tenacious and persevering learning spirit. The process of learning from the Soviet Union is a process of ideological transformation. To eliminate the influence of bourgeois ideology, we must go through fierce ideological struggles. In this regard, any conservative ideas, skeptical attitudes, and wavering emotions are harmful. Based on the preliminary experience of the advantages of Soviet textbooks over the past year and some shortcomings exposed in the process of studying Soviet textbooks, we believe that we should make efforts in the following aspects to resolutely study the Soviet Union and do a good job in teaching work in the future:

First, we must strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism and improve our political and ideological level. The advantage of Soviet textbooks lies first in the fact that they are permeated with dialectical materialism viewpoints. Without a high level of Marxism-Leninism theory, it is difficult to learn Soviet textbooks well, and it is also difficult to do a good job in university teaching; therefore, vigorously strengthening the study of Marxism-Leninism theory is the key to learning advanced Soviet teaching experience.

Second, we must actively study the relevant policies, policies, and plans of the People's Government, and study the history and current situation of this science. Basic course teachers should learn professional knowledge, and professional course teachers should learn production knowledge. In the past, we did not pay attention to or did not do enough in these aspects of learning, so that detachment from politics means detachment from reality. Facts tell us that if the professional course teachers of socialist agricultural enterprise management major do not have in-depth research on the actual situation of state-owned farms, agricultural machinery stations, and mutual aid and cooperation institutions and national policies, they will definitely not be able to teach well.

Third, we must study deeply and comprehensively master Soviet textbooks. This requires carefully reading Soviet textbooks, combining with reality, and conducting necessary verification calculations, experiments, and internships. Only in this way can we master its content and the scientific ideas and methods that run through the textbook.

Fourth, in order to do a good job in teaching, we must strengthen the work of teaching and research groups organizationally, make the teaching and research group a strong collective, give play to the wisdom and strength of the masses, and carry out various tasks with leadership and planning. For this reason, we must vigorously carry out criticism and self-criticism. The process of learning from the Soviet Union is a process of ideological transformation. The decadent bourgeois ideology and the idealistic viewpoint on academic research once occupied a dominant position in the old Chinese universities. Therefore, only by launching an active ideological struggle and gradually eliminating these decadent ideas can we accept the advanced science of the Soviet Union, do a good job in teaching, and complete the glorious task entrusted to us by the motherland.

    更好地学习苏联教材，改进教学工作
    北京农业机械化学院副院长　孙景鲁
    在高等学校里学习苏联以改进教学工作的中心环节，在于深入地钻研苏联教材，掌握它的基本内容，掌握它的思想体系和所用方法。只有在全面掌握苏联教材的基础上，才有可能使专业课结合业务生产要求，基础课结合专业课要求，从学生水准出发，依照整个教学计划所规定的时间，确定合用的教学大纲和教学内容；只有在这种基础上，集体教学才不致落空，种种先进教学方式（课堂讨论、课程设计、教学实习、生产实习等）才不致流于形式；讲授内容才有可能生动活泼。
    一
    苏联教材的优越性究竟表现在那些方面呢？根据北京农业机械化学院一年来的体会，初步地总结为下列几方面：
    一、苏联教材具有高度的政治思想性。每一种苏联教材，都贯穿着科学技术应为政治服务的思想，贯穿着爱国主义和国际主义思想。苏联教材的绪论都明确地指出这门科学在国民经济建设中的地位及发展方向，以及党和政府在这方面的政策、法令和计划。这样就使科学和政治紧密地结合起来。例如：我院农学专业所采用的苏联格林卡著“普通化学”，在绪论中就讲到苏联的化学和化学工业在工业生产及国防建设上的重要性，说明了由于化学工业的不断改进，在改善和提高苏联劳动人民生活中所发挥的重大作用，明确地提出了化学为生产服务、为劳动人民服务的观点。英美的教科书则相反，它灌输给学生以资本主义的个人主义观点。像国内过去常用的鲍林著“普通化学”第一章绪论就说，有一位教过化学的教师，后来到一家肥皂公司供职，改进了生产，升任了公司的研究部长和副经理；又有一位青年化学教师，由于创造了一种测定酸度的仪器，就组织公司制造这种仪器，生意十分兴隆。这原形毕露地说明了资本主义国家的教师是让学生在学了化学之后，去充当资本家，或者为资本家服务的。
    二、苏联教材贯穿着辩证唯物主义观点，对资产阶级学说——唯心论进行着坚决的斗争。例如：关于数学的定义，唯心论者认为数学是一种专门玩弄抽象概念的学问，数学符号的运算是人类思惟自由创造出来的，完全和实际问题无关。我院农业机械化专业采用的苏联贝尔曼著“数学解析教程”，一开头就驳斥了这种观点，明确地指出，数学是从实际中来，又反过来指导实践的科学。著者引用了恩格斯的论文，指出这门科学“……是完全借鉴于外界，而根本不是从头脑中纯粹思惟产生出来的”，其对象是“现实世界中的空间形状与数量关系”。在方法方面，该书又指出，数学解析应按下列程序拟定教材结构：实践——解析的基本概念——这些概念的性质（理论）——计算方法——用法——实践。全书就这样根据科学的认识过程，反复地教育学生用唯物主义的观点、辩证的方法进行分析和处理数学问题。毛主席教导我们：“真正的理论在世界上只有一种，就是从客观实际抽出来又在客观实际中得到了证明的理论”。苏联教材是符合这种要求的，它能够给学生以科学的理论知识，并能够在教学实践过程中给学生以科学方法的训练。
    三、苏联教材贯穿着经济和安全的原则。苏联教学计划和教材都突出地指出这样的原则：在建设和生产过程中，对人力、材料的经济和设备、人身的安全的考虑占首要地位。苏联杜伯夫的“物理学教程”就指出：整个工程科学的任务就在于推进对自然认识的准确度，使得更安全和经济。在格鲁之可夫等著“农业机械原理结构与计算一书”中，指出必须考虑到使用中的经济，要尽量减少农械的重量，免得浪费油料和马力。苏联农械的设计，已进入考虑在可能的地方，尽量允许机件的弹性变形。在斯维尔舍夫斯基著“农业机械使用学”中，特别强调对油料的防火、耕作中人员的安全。这些都充分表现了为劳动人民减轻劳动强度、改善劳动环境、保护劳动人民安全的观点。
    四、苏联教材有明确的目的性，结合专业，重点突出。例如我院农学专业采用的苏联安琳娜著“分析化学”，重点地介绍了和农业科学有关的部分，同时又保持了分析化学的系统性。在农业上常遇到的铵、钾、钠、钡、镁、铝、铁、锰等离子，这本教材就重点地反复进行分析实验，这就保证了学生操作技术的熟练；铅、汞、铜、亚砷酸根等则作一般的叙述；钨、锡、锑、钴等和农业化学关系不太大的，就精简了；矽酸根是农业科学上常用的很重要的离子，一般分析化学书里没有，这本教材添入了。苏联教材不论是专业课或基础课的都有明确的目的性，因而能够保证并加强各该专业的学习，这比资本主义国家那种盲目的、通用于不同专业的、学习上浪费很多时间而不能解决实际问题的教材，显然优越得多了。
    五、苏联教材有完整的体系，理论严密，条理清楚，富于启发性。苏联亚尔多波莱夫斯基著“机构与机器原理”一书，在指出本门科学的范围、一些基本定义及历史知识后，将全书内容分成机构构造、机构运动学、机构动力学及机器动力学四个部分讲述。在讲述机构构造时，先将所有现代实用的各种机构系统地加以汇集综合，并加以分类，然后研究分析。首先分析构成机构的基本因素的运动对和运动链。譬如运动对的种类、构成及其自由度，本书就作了详尽的分析，得出构成规律，返回来指导运动对和运动链的设计。又以运动链为基础进而研究机构构成的性质，得出其构造和活动度间的依从规律，返回来指导机构构造的设计。过去普遍采用的英美机构学教材，则只包括机构构造和机构运动学两部分，对机构动力学及机器动力学则不讲，这样就破坏了机构原理这门科学的完整体系；对机构构造，英美教材也没有深入地加以研究，对运动对及其自由度机构构成及其活动度都没有进行分析，因而不能构成理论体系。亚氏所采用的从汇集实例、抽象分析、得出公式，返回来指导设计的步骤是条理分明的，能够启发学生思考。
    六、苏联教材内容丰富，每种教材都介绍了该门科学的基本规律，介绍了该门科学的最新成就。不论是数学、物理学、力学、机械原理学或是拖拉机学、农业机械学，苏联教材的内容都是英美教材所不能比拟的。例如农业机械学，英美教材不论是最普遍采用的戴维逊著“农业机械学”，或是最新（一九四八年）出版的端纳和约翰逊著“农庄牧场与垦殖场机械”一书，都是先从工程材料和机械零件等的浅近介绍开始，然后讲述各种农械的种类、牌号、构造、调整、保养和修理，这实际上成了市面上各种机械的说明书。苏联教材如列多士聂夫著“农业机械学”或克鲁之可夫等著“农业机械理论结构与计算”，则对主要类型农械的工作部分和标准机件的构造，作了理论分析——工作过程中作用于农械本身的力学分析，机构分析，作用于加工对象（土壤、作物等）的物理机械性质变化的分析——用以指导农械的设计和使用。苏联农业机械科学之所以有这样高的理论水平，是因为苏联农业机械的设计和使用，不论在理论方面或是实际技术方面，都在全世界占有首要地位。苏联的农业机械学教材恰恰介绍了这些理论和实际的基本知识和最新知识。
    二
    北京农业机械化学院一年来在学习苏联教材方面是有一定成绩的。但一般说来，还存在着两种倾向：一种是保守主义的倾向，学习苏联教材不够虚心，不够积极，满足于表面的、形式的学习，不肯深入地、仔细地研究。有些教师，在刚开始学习苏联教材时，不是认真地、虚心地学习它的精神实质和体会它的优越性，而是有着不同程度的思想上的抗拒。例如，有的教师说：“马有二百零五块骨头，美国马如此，苏联马亦如此，美国教材这样说，苏联教材也这样说，没有什么大的出入；又如在乳牛饲料单位上，斯堪的纳维亚半岛的单位是一斤燕麦，苏联的单位是一斤大麦，斯堪的纳维亚半岛的畜牧业很发达，可能苏联还是向他们学习的。”于是得出了这样的错误结论：参考一些苏联教材，补充一些新的资料是可以的，讲授苏联教材则大可不必，何况中国还有她的特殊情况，我们应该“结合中国的实际”，等等。这种思想，是学习苏联教材的重大障碍。
    另一种是冒进思想，比较突出的是操之过急地盲目搬运苏联教材。我们有些教师，很想一下把教学改革突击完成，于是就产生了这样的现象：仓促翻译教材，对教材还没有来得及认真学习，就很快地使用这些教材，等到上了几课以后，才发现这种教材不完全适用。譬如：我院采用贝尔曼著的“数学解析教程”就是这样的。教研组决定采用时连看一遍也没有来得及，更谈不上研究它的内容是否适用于我们的专业，教师是否能够领会、讲授，学生是否能懂，时间长短是否合适等等。结果绪论和第一章就教了五个多星期，超出计划时间一倍以上，不只教员感到吃力，学生也有意见，而且打乱了整个教学进度，教学大纲不得不一改再改，后面的教材不能不硬性压缩，最后还是没法应付，只好改编讲义，使得教学效果受了很大的影响。
    此外，在学习方法方面也有偏向。目前还有不少教师把钻研苏联教材的工作停留在死啃书本的阶段上，没有能结合专业做一些必要的复证演算、试验、实习，或到有关生产现场观察见习，增加感性认识，深刻体会和思考，结果上课时内容空洞，摆弄一些教条，对学生没有很大的帮助。有些教师对整个教材的思想体系、系统编排、所用的方法等的研究都不够注意，对教材的优越性也不深入体会作为授课指导原则。这些脱离实际的方法，影响了我们学习苏联教材的效果。
    三
    在学习苏联、改进教学的过程中，不可避免地会遇到一些问题和困难的，因此要求我们端正学习态度，发挥顽强的、坚持不渝的学习精神。学习苏联的过程是一个思想改造的过程，要清除资产阶级的思想影响，就不能不经过激烈的思想斗争，在这方面，任何保守思想、怀疑态度和动摇情绪都是有害的。根据一年来对苏联教材优越性的初步体会，和学习苏联教材过程中暴露的一些缺点，对今后坚决学习苏联、搞好教学工作，我们认为应从这几方面努力：
    首先要加强马克思列宁主义的学习，提高政治思想水平。苏联教材的优越性首先在于贯穿着辩证唯物主义观点，没有高度的马克思列宁主义理论水平，很难学好苏联教材，也就很难做好高等学校的教学工作；所以大力加强马克思列宁主义理论的学习，是学习苏联先进教学经验的关键。
    其次，要积极地学习人民政府有关的方针、政策和计划，学习有关本门科学的历史和现状。基础课教师要学习专业知识，专业课教师要学习生产知识。对于这些方面的学习，过去我们是不注意或者做得很不够的，以致脱离政治就是脱离实际。事实告诉我们，社会主义农业企业经营管理专业的专业课教师，如果对国营农场、农业机械站及互助合作机构的实际情况和国家政策没有深入研究，就一定不能教好。
    第三，要深入钻研，全面地掌握苏联教材。这就须要精读苏联教材，联系实际，进行必要的复证演算、试验、实习，只有这样，才能掌握其内容和贯穿在教材中的科学思想和方法。
    第四，为着搞好教学工作，必须从组织上加强教研组工作，使教研组成为一个强有力的集体，发挥群众的智慧和力量，有领导、有计划地进行各项工作。为此，须要大力开展批评和自我批评。学习苏联的过程是一个思想改造的过程。资产阶级腐朽思想和学术研究上的唯心观点曾经在旧中国的高等学校占有统治地位。因此，只有展开积极的思想斗争，逐步清除这些腐朽思想，才可能接受苏联的先进科学，把教学工作做好，完成祖国给予我们的光荣任务。
