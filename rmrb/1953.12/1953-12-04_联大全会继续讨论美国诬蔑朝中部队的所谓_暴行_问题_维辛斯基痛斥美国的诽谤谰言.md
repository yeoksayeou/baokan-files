Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd: According to TASS, New York: The United Nations General Assembly continued its meeting on December 1 to discuss the issue of the so-called "atrocities" committed by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army against the "United Nations Forces" prisoners of war, as proposed by the United States delegation.

The Soviet representative, Vyshinsky, spoke, exposing the provocative purpose of the United States delegation in raising this slanderous accusation. He said that the United States delegation's move to include this issue in the agenda of the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly was merely a repetition of the United States' release of Colonel Hanley's report in 1951. The main purpose of publishing the Hanley report at that time was to sabotage the Korean armistice negotiations. A secondary purpose was to launch propaganda among the American troops stationed in Korea to curb the widespread anti-war sentiment on the front lines. However, Colonel Welch, who investigated the publication of the Hanley report, concluded that Hanley's accusations were not based on facts and did not conform to the actual situation. The provocative accusations of the United States military authorities and Colonel Hanley's report suffered a disastrous defeat.

Today, they are again slandering the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army with the same so-called "atrocities," which is merely an unprecedentedly shameless and deceptive propaganda ploy, the purpose of which is to divert people's attention from the most serious crimes committed by the American interventionist forces in Korea against humanity.

Vyshinsky analyzed the so-called "documentary materials" presented by the United States representative, Lodge. He pointed out that these materials were not evidence documents, but merely things of low taste. These materials show that their drafters are document forgers, and the forgery techniques are very poor.

Vyshinsky pointed out that the so-called investigation was mainly conducted by the South Korean police, which is sufficient to prove the deceptive and provocative nature of this fabricated document. Everyone knows that the South Korean police used barbaric methods against the arrested during the so-called "investigation." Under such circumstances, there is no, nor can there be any guarantee that this investigation has the minimum of authenticity.

Vyshinsky said that it is precisely because the United States authorities have shamelessly violated all the standards and principles of international law regarding the protection of prisoners of war that the shamelessness and ugliness of this action become even more obvious.

Vyshinsky cited many examples to prove that North Korean and Chinese prisoners of war were treated inhumanely in American prisoner-of-war camps. He reminded the Assembly to pay attention to the barbaric killing of Korean civilians by the United States armed forces.

Vyshinsky said that as early as 1950, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea had repeatedly appealed to the United Nations, demanding that the Security Council take action to stop such atrocities. But their efforts were unsuccessful every time. In the following years, despite repeated protests from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, despite protests and interventions from international organizations, and despite the demands of the broad masses of the people to abide by the Hague Convention of 1907 (which the United States armed forces constantly violated, turning Korean towns into ruins), the atrocities of the American interventionists and the Rhee Syngman executioners continued and intensified.

Vyshinsky said that the people of the world know very well who is committing atrocities, violating conventions and the minimum standards of international law, and who is trying to cover up this situation by slandering the Korean and Chinese troops. The General Assembly must not become a tool of the reactionary forces of the United States and other countries in the policies they have adopted on this issue. The General Assembly must not allow these reactionary forces to prevent a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

Forcing the General Assembly to discuss the so-called violation of the principles and standards of international law by the Korean and Chinese troops is a manifestation of the current foreign policy of the United States, which aims to prevent the easing of international tensions, to freely continue the arms race, and to prepare for another world war without restraint. It is for this reason that the American reactionaries have chosen this time, when the Soviet government is making every effort to ease international tensions and resolve international disputes, to place new obstacles on this path, which is in the vital interests of all peace-loving people.

Vyshinsky finally expressed his opposition to the proposal of the United States and five other countries.

The Czechoslovak representative, David, pointed out in his speech that the United States' forcing the General Assembly to discuss this slanderous accusation is to use it to complicate relations between countries and poison the international atmosphere. He emphasized that the United States ruling group is attempting to incite a movement to slander the People's Republic of China in order to set up new obstacles on the road to restoring China's legitimate rights in the United Nations. This movement is doomed to failure.

Representatives from Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Belgium, France, Greece, and the Federation of South Africa, who sent troops to support the United States' aggression against the Korean people, spoke at the meeting, repeating the slanderous lies of the United States representative against China and North Korea.

    联大全会继续讨论美国诬蔑朝中部队的所谓“暴行”问题
    维辛斯基痛斥美国的诽谤谰言
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会全体会议于十二月一日继续开会，讨论美国代表团提出的所谓朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军对“联合国军”战俘施行“暴行”的问题。
    苏联代表维辛斯基发言，揭穿了美国代表团提出这个诽谤性控告的挑衅目的。他说，美国代表团要把这个问题列入联合国第八届大会议程的举动只是重复美国在一九五一年发表汉莱上校的报告的举动。当时发表汉莱报告的主要目的是破坏朝鲜停战谈判。附带目的是在驻朝美军中发动宣传，以制止前线上普遍的反战情绪。但是，调查汉莱报告发表经过的魏尔奇上校得出的结论是，汉莱提出的指责不是以事实为依据的，也不符合实际情况。美国军事当局的挑衅指责和汉莱上校的报告遭到了惨败。
    今天他们又以同样的所谓“暴行”来诬蔑朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，这只是一个空前无耻和欺骗性的宣传手段，其目的是要使人们不去注意朝鲜美国干涉军对人类所犯的最严重的罪行。
    维辛斯基分析了美国代表洛奇提出的所谓“文件材料”，他指出，这些材料并不是证明文件，只是一些低级趣味的东西，这些材料说明它的草拟者是文件伪造者，而且伪造技术十分低劣。
    维辛斯基指出，所谓调查工作主要是南朝鲜警察做的，这一点已足能证明这个捏造的文件的骗人与挑衅性质了。大家都知道，南朝鲜警察在进行所谓“调查”时对被捕者使用了野蛮手段。在这种情况下，没有，也不可能有任何保障，保证这个调查具有起码的真实性。
    维辛斯基说，正是由于美国当局无耻地破坏国际法中所有关于保护战俘的标准与原则，这种行动的无耻与丑恶也就更加明显。
    维辛斯基举出许多例子，证明北朝鲜与中国战俘在美国战俘营中受到惨无人道的待遇。他提醒大会注意美国武装部队野蛮杀害朝鲜平民的行动。
    维辛斯基说，早在一九五○年，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府曾多次向联合国提出要求，要求安全理事会采取行动来制止这种暴行。但是他们的努力每一次都没有得到结果。在后来的几年中，尽管朝鲜民主主义人民共和国一再抗议，尽管国际组织出面抗议与干涉，尽管广大人民要求遵守一九○七年的海牙公约（美国武装部队不断破坏这个公约，使朝鲜城镇变为废墟），但是美国干涉者与李承晚刽子手的暴行仍继续下去，而且变本加厉。
    维辛斯基说，全世界人民都知道得很清楚，究竟是谁施行暴行，违反公约和起码的国际法标准，是谁企图以诽谤朝中部队来掩饰这种情况。大会决不能成为美国和其他一些国家的反动势力在这个问题上所采取的政策的工具。大会必须不许这些反动势力阻止朝鲜问题的和平解决。
    强迫大会讨论所谓朝中部队违反国际法原则和标准的问题，是美国目前的外交政策的一种表现，这种政策的目的是阻止国际紧张局势的缓和，是想自由地继续进行军备竞赛，并毫无约束地准备另一次世界大战。正是为了这个缘故，美国反动分子便选择了现在，也就是苏联政府在尽一切努力争取缓和国际紧张局势和解决国际争端的时候，在这条符合于全体爱好和平人民切身利益的道路上安置新的障碍。
    维辛斯基最后表示反对美国等五国提案。
    捷克斯洛伐克代表戴维发言指出，美国强迫大会讨论这个诽谤性控告，是要用这来使各国间关系复杂化，并毒害国际气氛。他着重指出，美国统治集团正在企图煽起一个诽谤中华人民共和国的运动，以便在恢复中国在联合国的合法权利的道路上设立起新的障碍。这个运动注定是要失败的。
    曾派军队支持美国侵略朝鲜人民的澳大利亚、荷兰、新西兰、比利时、法国、希腊和南非联邦等国代表在会上发言，重复美国代表诽谤中朝两国的谰言。
