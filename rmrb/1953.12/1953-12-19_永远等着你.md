    Always Waiting for You
    Zhang Zhen'an
    I waited for half a month, then another half a month, and then continuously for a month and a half, but I still didn't receive her letter! My heart began to feel uneasy!

    Could something have changed? No, Guiying is a good girl. We've been together since I can remember. After liberation, we sat at the same desk at the people's school. I have feelings for her, and she has feelings for me. All the villagers know that we are fond of each other. We only separated when I joined the army.

    Whenever I think of her, I think of the touching scene of her giving me flowers on the day I joined the army. After the farewell meeting ended, the girls in the village, wearing colorful clothes and holding flowers, ran towards the eighteen young men who were joining the army. Guiying ran in the front, as if afraid someone else would take her place. I really didn't expect her to be so bold, running straight towards me like that. She looked at me with smiling eyes, and silently handed me the flowers. She shyly pointed at the flowers, then pointed at them again.

    My heart felt warm, and I couldn't describe the feeling. I looked at the flowers, thinking, "Why does she keep pointing at the flowers?" I fiddled with the bouquet, and ha, I discovered a secret! There was a small note hidden inside! I opened the note with one hand, and saw written on it in crooked handwriting: "Ruisheng! You're leaving soon! ... You're afraid I'll be sad, aren't you? No, I'm very happy! It's my honor to have someone like you... Ruisheng, remember the villagers' instructions, remember what I told you yesterday, you must work hard! I will definitely work hard in production to support you. Let's meet again when we both have medals pinned on our chests." The last few lines had thin curved lines drawn next to them, and were written: "My beloved Ruisheng, don't worry, I will always wait for you. I hope you will too. But remember, don't forget to write to me."

    From then on, we corresponded almost every half month. We've been separated for more than two years, but letters have kept us connected. But, it's been a month and a half since I received a letter, what could be the reason? Could she have... no, she's not that kind of girl.

    One day, after training, while we were resting, the instructor came to our dormitory. He knew that Guiying hadn't written for a long time, and that I was worried, so he came to talk to me specifically. He talked to me gently for a long time. He said, "Young man, be optimistic! It's the most glorious thing to be a soldier of the national defense army. Who would she love if not the most glorious person? She won't change her heart! You should remember the song 'Vasya, Good Vasya' that the Soviet Red Banner Song and Dance Ensemble performed here last time!" The instructor's words reminded me. I remembered that song very clearly. The song told the story of a happy soldier named Vasya who suddenly became depressed because his beloved girl hadn't written to him in a long time. He thought the girl didn't love him anymore, but actually, the girl had become a labor hero and gone to a celebration meeting, so she wrote the letter late. I thought, maybe some similar reasons are why Guiying hasn't written!

    A day passed, two days passed, I waited patiently for her letter.

    One day, during rest time, we were dancing the Soviet Red Army's saber dance to the sound of an accordion. Just as we were dancing happily, I suddenly saw the messenger holding a letter, waving it at me, and running away. My heart skipped a beat, thinking: Is it from her? So I chased after the messenger. The little devil was really naughty, forcing me to salute him before giving me the letter.

    Ha! It really was her letter! I opened it and found a photo inside. The photo showed a tractor, and sitting on the tractor was a girl in a floral dress, that was Guiying.

    After looking at the photo, I quickly read the letter. The letter read: "Comrade Ruisheng: You must be getting impatient, right? Yes, it's been a long time since I wrote to you. But don't overthink it, didn't I say I would always wait for you! There's a reason why I haven't written to you for more than a month. This May, the higher-ups transferred me to a tractor school. You know how happy I am, Ruisheng, you'll be happy to hear it too, right? You must have culture to learn technology. The other students all have junior high school education or above, only I have a low level of education, just finished reading the fifth volume of the peasants' textbook. So naturally it's a bit difficult to learn. But when I think of the spirit of you training in the hot sun, my confidence comes. For half a month straight, I haven't taken a nap at noon, and I'm still studying when others are resting. My grades were pretty good on the graduation exam, and I even got a red flag. Look at the photo, that flag is the one I got. Ruisheng, that's why I haven't written to you for so long. Will you blame me? I think you'll forgive me. You should be happy, your country girl can already command such a big, big tractor! ... Tell me, how are your training results? The sun must have made you even darker! ..."

    Reading her letter, I can't describe the joy in my heart. I seem to see her sitting upright on the tractor, her hands fiddling with the steering wheel, the tractor running on the grass, her hair being blown back by the wind. I seem to hear her laughter. ... Soon, thousands of acres of wasteland will be transformed into fertile land. Ah, the crops are growing. The sun shines on the rolling wheat fields, shimmering with golden light. The wheat is ripe, and the first harvest is obtained. At the celebration meeting, Guiying has a red flower pinned on her chest! ...

    Good, Guiying, let me use my gun to protect your, my, and the happiness of the people of the whole country!

    永远等着你
    张振安
    等了半个月，又等了半个月，一连等了一个半月，可还是没收到她的来信！我的心开始不安啦！
    不会有什么变挂吧！不会，桂英是个好样的姑娘，从记事时候起我们就在一起。解放后上民校我们坐一张桌子。我心里有她，她心里也有我。乡亲们也全知道我和她相好。直到我参军时才分手。
    一想起她，我就想起我参军那天她给我送花的那幅动人的情景。欢送大会结束了，村里的姑娘们穿着花花绿绿的衣裳，抱着鲜花向我们参军的十八个年青小伙子跑来了。桂英跑在最前头，好像生怕别人占了她的先。我真没想到她这么大胆，竟照直向我跑来啦。她用含笑的眼睛望着我，默不作声地把鲜花递给我。她羞答答地用手指了指花，又指了指花。
    我心里热呼呼的，说不出是什么滋味。我看着花，想着：“她为什么老指着花呢？”我把束着的花拨弄了一下，哈，发现秘密啦，原来里面还夹着一个小纸条哩！我用一只手打开了纸条，只见上面歪歪扭扭地写着：“瑞生！你马上就要走了！……你怕我难过吧？不，我很高兴！我能有你这样的……是我的光荣。瑞生，记住乡亲们的嘱咐，记住我昨天对你说的话，要好好干哪！我一定好好生产来支援你们，等我们胸前都挂上奖章时再见吧。”最后的几行旁边划上了细细的曲线，写的是：“我心爱的瑞生，你放心，我永远等着你。希望你也这样。可记着呀，千万别忘记给我写信。”
    从那时候起，我们就差不多每半个月通一次信。分别两年多了，信却把我们连在一起。但是，一个半月没有来信了，是什么原因呢？难道她有了……不，不会，她不是这样的姑娘。
    一天，练兵以后，正在休息，指导员到我们宿舍来了，他知道桂英好久没来信了，我在着急，特意来跟我谈话的，他温和地跟我谈了半天，他说：“小伙子，乐观点吧！当国防军战士是最光荣的，她不爱最光荣的人爱谁呢？她不会变心的！你该记得前次苏联红旗歌舞团来我们这里表演的那支‘瓦夏，好瓦夏’的歌子吧！”指导员这一说提醒了我。那支歌子我还记得很清楚。歌里说一个快乐的战士瓦夏忽然苦闷起来，因为他心爱的姑娘很久没有给他来信了。他以为姑娘不爱他了，其实呢，那个姑娘是当上了劳动英雄，参加庆功大会去了，所以信写迟了。我想，桂英不来信，也许会是这样一些原因吧！
    一天过去了，两天过去了，我耐心地等着她的来信。
    有一天，休息时间，我们跟着手风琴的声音跳苏联红军的马刀舞。正跳得高兴，忽然看见通讯员拿着一封信向着我幌了一下就跑了。我心里一动，心想：是她的吗？就去追通讯员。小鬼真淘气，硬逼着我给他敬了个礼才把信给我。
    哈！真是她的信！打开一看，里面还有一张照片，照片上有一架拖拉机，拖拉机上坐着一个穿花衣服的姑娘，那就是桂英。
    看了照片，就赶忙看信。信上这样写着：“瑞生同志：你等急了吧？可不是，很久没给你写信了。可是你别胡思乱想，我不是说过要永远等着你吗！一个多月没给你写信是有原因的。今年五月间，上级调我去住拖拉机学校。你知道我多么高兴呀，瑞生，你听了也会高兴吧？学技术一定要有文化，别的学员都是初中以上文化程度，就数我文化程度低，刚读完农民课本第五册。这样学起来自然有些困难。但是我一想起你们在炎热的阳光下练兵的精神，信心就来了。一连半个月我没有睡过午觉，别人休息时我还在学习。毕业考试时我的成绩挺好，还得了一面红旗。你看看照片吧，那面旗子就是我得的。瑞生，我就是为这个原因很久没有写信给你。你会见怪吗？我想你会原谅我的。你应该高兴呀，你的这个乡下姑娘已经会指挥那么老大老大的拖拉机啦！……告诉我，你练兵的成绩怎么样？大概太阳把你晒得更黑了！……”
    读着她的信，说不出心里那股乐味。我好像看见她端正地坐在拖拉机上，手拨弄着驾驶盘，拖拉机在草地上跑着，她的头发被风吹向脑后。我好像听见了她的笑声。……一会儿千万亩荒地变成了良田。啊，庄稼长起来了。太阳照在起伏的麦浪上，闪闪地发出金光。麦子熟了，得到了第一次丰收。在庆功大会上，桂英的胸前挂上了红花！……
    好，桂英，让我好好用枪杆子来保卫你的、我的以及全国人民的幸福吧！
