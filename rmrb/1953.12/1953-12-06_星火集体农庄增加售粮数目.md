Xinhua News Agency, Jiamusi, 4th—After further studying the general line, members of the Xinghuo Collective Farm in Huachuan County, Songjiang Province, Northeast China, expanded their original plan to sell 1.62 million jin of surplus grain to 1.86 million jin. This newly added batch of grain was saved by the farm members from their daily lives based on the principle of thrift. At present, the Xinghuo Collective Farm has delivered 187,500 jin of high-quality first-class rice to the state-owned grain company.
    The members of the Xinghuo Collective Farm decided to complete the entire grain sales plan by the end of December. In order to promptly deliver good grain to the state-owned grain company, continuous operations have been implemented for threshing and rice milling. Among the towering grain stacks, large threshing machines and electric threshers are running non-stop. As soon as the rice is threshed, it is pushed along the narrow-gauge railway in small carts to the rice mill, where the rice milling machine grinds it into white rice, and then it is transported by sixteen large carts to the state-owned grain company.
    The funds obtained from the sale of grain by the Xinghuo Collective Farm will be used to expand production and improve living standards. They plan to recruit forty new farm households next year. In order to prepare seeds for the new farm members' land, they have bought a batch of the best local "Ishikari Hakumo" rice seeds, and have also prepared the funds needed to build twenty-five houses for the new farm members next year. In addition, ten strong horses will be purchased for transportation and to supplement the insufficient tractor sowing in the coming spring. After discussion and approval by the members' congress, all members entrusted the farm management committee to deposit the cash distributed from the grain sales into the National Bank.

    星火集体农庄增加售粮数目
    【新华社佳木斯四日电】东北松江省桦川县星火集体农庄庄员们进一步学习总路线后，把原来决定出售一百六十二万斤余粮的计划，扩大为一百八十六万斤。新增加的这批粮食，是庄员们根据节约原则在生活中节余出的。现在，星火集体农庄已送到国营粮食公司的大米有十八万七千五百斤。这些米都是品质优良的一等米。
    星火集体农庄的庄员们决定在十二月底完成全部售粮计划。为了及时地把好粮送到国营粮食公司，脱谷和制米都实行了连续作业。在堆积如山的粮垛中间，大型脱谷机和电力脱粒机不停地转动着。稻子刚打出来马上就用小车顺着窄轨铁道推进制米所，制米机又把它碾成白米，然后由十六台大车送到国营粮食公司。
    星火集体农庄出售粮食得到的资金，准备用于扩大生产和改善生活。他们明年要吸收四十户新庄员。为了给新庄员耕地准备种籽，已买回一批当地最好的“石狩白毛”稻种，还准备了为明年新庄员修盖二十五栋房舍需用的资金。另外，还买十匹壮马以备运输和补助明春拖拉机播种的不足。经庄员大会讨论通过，全体庄员把售粮分到的现金委托农庄管理委员会统一存入国家银行。
