    Improving the Quality of Bookbinding
    —A Summary of Readers' Letters
    Recently, many readers have written to express opinions on the shortcomings in bookbinding work, mainly focusing on the following points:
    1.  Certain books and periodicals frequently have missing or duplicated pages. Song Bao-fan from the Jiutai County Grain Storage and Transportation Company in Jilin Province wrote: "Our company has thirty-six people subscribed to the elementary edition of 'Study'. Recently, we received Volume II, Issue 12, published on October 15th, and found that ten of them were missing pages 3 to 18." Zhang Rongzhi from the Propaganda Department of the Uxin Banner Committee of the Communist Party of China in Suiyuan Province wrote: "At the beginning of September, our organization bought a batch of 'Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China' (published by the People's Publishing House, printed by the Beijing Xinhua Printing Factory), and thirty-four of them had pages 13 to 26 bound twice, while pages 31 to 46 were missing." Tian Jun from the First Primary School of Anda County, Heilongjiang Province, also reported to this newspaper that among the fifty elementary school textbooks published by the People's Education Publishing House purchased at the beginning of the school year, four had missing pages and two had extra pages. Hu Xiufan from the Northeast Gongzhuling Post Office wrote: "Recently, many readers frequently come to our post office to return or exchange periodicals with binding errors, such as the elementary edition of 'Study', which often have missing or reversed pages. This has added a lot of difficulties to our distribution work."
    2.  Many books and periodicals are not bound firmly. Lin Li from a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army wrote: "Many books I borrowed from the library and purchased myself, such as 'Selected Poems of Hikmet', 'Contemporary Translations of the Poems of Qu Yuan', and 'Goddess', published by the People's Literature Publishing House, are of very poor binding quality and fall apart after being read a few times." Qi Guoliang from the Acheng branch of Xinhua Bookstore wrote: "Many of the new books we receive have loose pages and damaged covers. Readers are unwilling to buy these damaged books; returning them to the original publisher for exchange would cost round-trip registered postage. It is worth noting that the number of such damaged books received by our bookstore this year has increased by ninety percent compared to last year."
    The above-mentioned shortcomings in bookbinding work not only affect readers' learning but also cause losses to the nation's wealth. Readers are requesting that the bookbinding workers in the printing factories actively find ways to improve the quality of bookbinding during the production increase and economy drive.
    In addition, some readers have also written to reflect that some book distribution agencies have the phenomenon of packing and sending books with extra or missing copies. Yang Zhihua, a reader from a certain organization in Beijing, wrote: "We purchased more than two hundred and forty copies each of Volumes II and III of the 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong' from the Haidian Xinhua Bookstore, packed in four boxes. After transporting them back and opening them, we found that three of the four boxes had errors in the number of books packed, with two boxes containing four extra copies and one box containing eight extra copies." Reader Qi Guoliang also reflected that the Acheng branch of Xinhua Bookstore received ten sets of the "Water Margin Liangshan" comic books published by the Xinmei Publishing House, one of which had volumes 4, 5, and 6, but not volumes 1, 2, and 3; one of the complete sets of "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" published by Tonglian Bookstore also had an extra Volume 9. It is hoped that the book distribution agencies will educate the relevant staff to pay attention to correcting these types of errors.

    提高书刊装订工作的质量
    ——读者来信综述
    最近不少读者来信对书刊装订工作中的缺点提出了一些意见，其中主要的是：
    一、某些书刊经常有缺页或重页的现象。吉林省九台县粮谷储运公司宋宝藩来信说：“我公司有三十六人订阅学习初级版，最近我们接到十月十五日出版的第二卷第十二期后，发现其中十本都没有第三页到十八页。”中共绥远省乌审旗委宣传部张荣知来信说：“九月初我们机关买来一批‘中国共产党三十年’（人民出版社出版，北京新华印刷厂印刷），其中有三十四本都把十三页到二十六页订重了，而没有三十一页至四十六页。”黑龙江省安达县第一完全小学田军也向本报反映了学校开学时所购的五十本人民教育出版社出版的小学课本有四本少页、二本多页。东北公主岭邮局胡秀范来信说：
  “最近经常有很多读者来我局退换装订有错误的期刊，如学习初级版等杂志则往往缺页、倒页。这使我们发行工作增加了不少困难。”
    二、不少书刊装订不牢。中国人民解放军某部林立来信说：“我在图书馆借的和个人买的人民文学出版社出版的‘希克梅特诗集’、‘屈原赋今译’、‘女神’等很多书籍，装订质量很差，翻阅几次就散开了。”新华书店阿城支店祁国良来信说：
  “我店进货的新书中，散页和封面破损的很多。这些破损了的书籍，读者都不愿买；向原出版社退换，又得花费来回挂号邮资。值得注意的是，今年我们书店收到的这类破损书籍的数量，比去年增加了百分之九十。”
    书刊装订工作中的上述缺点，不仅影响了读者的学习，也造成了国家的财富损失。读者都要求书刊印刷厂的装订工人同志们在增产节约运动中积极设法提高书刊装订的质量。
    此外，还有一些读者来信反映：某些书籍发行机关装包寄发书籍时有多装或少装的现象。北京市某机关读者杨志华来信说：“我们向海淀新华书店购买的‘毛泽东选集’二、三卷各二百四十余册，共分装四箱。运回打开后，发现四箱中却有三箱是所装书籍数量有错误，其中有二箱都多装了四册，一箱多装了八册。”读者祁国良也反映了新华书店阿城支店进货的新美出版社出版的“水泊梁山”连环画十套，有一套装了第四、五、六册而没有第一、二、三册；通联书店出版的全套“三国志”也有一部多装了一本第九册。这类现象，希望图书发行机关教育有关工作人员注意纠正。
