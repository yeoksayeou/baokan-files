    Vietnam has vast cultivated land and dense forests. The Red River Delta in the north and the Mekong Delta in the south are two huge granaries. The total area of cultivated land in Vietnam is 4,736,000 hectares, accounting for about 15 percent of the country's total territory. However, a large part of the cultivated land is still barren; about one million hectares of land are barren in South Vietnam.
    
    I. Land Situation under Colonialism and Feudal Rule
    
    Vietnamese peasants account for 90 percent of the total population, and they are cruelly exploited under the enslavement of colonialism and feudalism. Feudal landlords and French colonists seized most of the land. According to statistics, most of the Vietnamese working peasants were deprived of their land. 50 percent of all cultivated land belonged to Vietnamese landlords and 25 percent belonged to French colonists. In South Vietnam, where land was highly concentrated, feudal landlords seized 88 percent of all land. One landlord owned 145,000 hectares (one hectare equals 15 mu). The area of public land was 500,000 hectares, but most of it was seized by local bullies and bad gentry.
    
    Landlords exploited peasants by various cruel methods, mainly by collecting high rents and interest.
    
    Tenants had to pay an average of 50 to 60 percent, or even 70 to 80 percent, of their harvest as rent each year; sometimes, tenants had to give all their harvest to the landlords.
    
    The interest paid by debtors sometimes reached 700 to 800 percent. Because of this murderous usury, debtors were unable to pay off their debts.
    
    Under this barbaric exploitation, peasants who toiled all day long lived a miserable life. In South Vietnam—Vietnam's great granary—peasants were so poor that landless peasants, husband and wife, only had one pair of pants.
    
    Under the rule of the French colonists, famines occurred in Vietnam every year. The most serious one occurred in 1945, when the French colonists and Japanese fascists colluded with reactionary feudal landlords to hoard rice and force peasants to pull out rice seedlings and plant jute, resulting in the death of two million people from starvation.
    
    II. Land Reform under the People's Democratic Regime
    
    After the August Revolution in 1945, the people seized power, and the Vietnamese government immediately began to reduce land rent by 25 percent and formulated the following land policies:
    
    ——Reduce land rent and interest;
    
    ——Temporarily distribute the land of French colonists and Vietnamese traitors to peasants with no or little land;
    
    ——Reasonably redistribute public land;
    
    ——Reasonably use the land of landlords in other places.
    
    By 1952, the following achievements had been made:
    
    250,000 hectares of land were temporarily distributed to nearly 500,000 peasants.
    
    According to incomplete statistics in 1950, 344,373 peasants had already received rent reductions.
    
    According to incomplete statistics in 1952, 317,000 hectares of public land had been distributed to peasants in liberated areas, guerrilla bases, and guerrilla zones.
    
    Interest reduction was implemented in some areas. In addition, local people's credit loans and mutual aid funds were established to help peasants with no or little land.
    
    As a result of these achievements, the living conditions of peasants have improved. Before the revolution, famines occurred every year. However, after the August Revolution, although the war was still going on, famine had almost completely disappeared in most of the liberated areas.
    
    However, the government encountered difficulties in implementing land policies.
    
    The Bao Dai-Nguyen Van Tam puppet group, reactionary feudal landlords, and rural despots have been obstructing and sabotaging the implementation of land policies.
    
    III. Fully Mobilize the Peasant Masses to Implement the Government's Land Policies
    
    At the beginning of 1953, President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnam Workers' Party, the Vietnamese government, and the Vietnam National United Front put forward the task of actively strengthening the power of the peasants: fully mobilize the masses to overthrow the reactionary feudal traitors and rural despots, crush the political power of the landlord class, weaken their economic power, partially meet the economic demands of the working peasants, and ensure that they obtain political status.
    
    The current land policies specifically include the following points:
    
    Thoroughly implement rent reduction (including compensating for land rent that landlords have not reduced, or have not reduced in accordance with government decrees) and implement interest reduction;
    
    Distribute the land belonging to French colonists and Vietnamese traitors to peasants with no or little land indefinitely;
    
    Distribute public land to peasants with no or little land indefinitely;
    
    Stipulate leases and prohibit landlords from arbitrarily taking back land.
    
    In order to implement this policy, the Vietnam Workers' Party and the Vietnamese government have sent two work groups to the Viet Bac Interzone (northern Vietnam) and the Fourth Interzone (north-central Vietnam) to mobilize the masses. Brilliant victories have been achieved in 22 pilot villages. Under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party, the working peasants have partially crushed the political forces of the landlord class and gained political status. In these rural areas, the people's regime and peasant associations have greatly developed and have been truly controlled by the working peasants. In addition, the economic power of the feudal landlords has been weakened. In the first stage of the mass mobilization campaign, more than 800 hectares of land originally belonging to reactionary feudal landlords were confiscated and distributed to peasants with no or little land in these 22 villages.
    
    This victory greatly encouraged peasants to work hard to increase production, making them more active in participating in the war of resistance. In the rural areas where the work of mobilizing the peasant masses has been completed, the peasants have enthusiastically paid agricultural taxes and competed to sign up in large numbers to join the People's Army or the civilian labor teams. New mutual aid groups have been established everywhere. In six villages in Thai Nguyen Province, 1,743 peasant households purchased new farm tools and draft animals.
    
    In September 1953, the Vietnam Workers' Party and the People's Government launched the second phase of the mass mobilization campaign in nearly 200 villages. Having learned from the experience of the first phase, the second phase of the campaign achieved brilliant success. The work of summarizing these achievements is about to be completed. The third phase of the mass mobilization campaign, which is about to be launched, will be carried out on a larger scale.
    
    At present, the movement to mobilize the masses to implement the government's land policies has encouraged people throughout the country to increase production and encouraged them to participate more actively in various war resistance efforts. The face of the Vietnamese countryside has undergone new changes, and the people's democratic regime is being consolidated day by day.
    
    With the continuous progress of the war of resistance, the land policies of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the People's Government are also being gradually implemented. The slogan "Land to the tiller" will soon become a reality. Under the wise leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnam Workers' Party, and the People's Government, the Vietnamese working peasants are pushing their revolution and armed struggle against imperialism and feudal forces towards complete victory.

### 越南民主共和国的土地改革

    越南民主共和国的土地改革
    越南拥有广大的耕地和茂密的森林。北部的红河三角洲和南部的湄公河三角洲是两个巨大的谷仓。越南耕地的总面积为四百七十三万六千公顷，约占全国领土面积的百分之十五。但是一大部分耕地至今仍然荒芜着；南越的荒地约有一百万公顷。
    一、在殖民主义和封建统治下的土地情况
    越南的农民占全部人口的百分之九十，他们在殖民主义和封建制度的奴役下受到残酷的剥削。封建地主和法国殖民者侵占了大部分土地。据统计，大多数的越南劳动农民都被剥夺了土地，全部耕地有百分之五十属于越南地主，百分之二十五属于法国殖民者。在土地非常集中的南越，封建地主侵占了全部土地的百分之八十八。其中有一个地主占地达到十四万五千公顷（一公顷合十五市亩）。公地的面积有五十万公顷，但大部被土豪劣绅所侵占。
    地主用种种残酷的方法剥削农民，主要的方法是收高额的地租和利息。
    佃户平均每年必须将收获物的百分之五十到六十，甚至百分之七十到八十交纳地租；有时候，佃户必须把全部收获物交给地主。
    债户付的利息有时高到百分之七百到八百。由于这种杀人的高利贷，债户是无法还清债务的。
    在这种野蛮的剥削下，终日劳作的农民过着悲惨的生活。在南越——越南的大谷仓，农民却是如此的贫困，无地的农民，夫妻两人只有一条裤子。
    在法国殖民者的统治下，越南每年都发生饥荒。最严重的一次发生在一九四五年，当时法国殖民者和日本法西斯分子与反动封建地主相勾结，囤积稻谷，强迫农民拔去稻子，种植黄麻，结果有二百万人饿死。
    二、在人民民主政权下的土地改革
    在一九四五年八月革命后，人民取得了政权，越南政府立即着手将地租减少了百分之二十五，并制订了下面的土地政策：
    ——减低地租和利息；
    ——将法国殖民者和越南卖国贼的土地暂时分配给无地或少地的农民；
    ——合理地重新分配公地；
    ——合理地使用在外地主的土地。
    到一九五二年已取得了如下的成就：
    将二十五万公顷的土地暂时分配给将近五十万的农民。
    据一九五零年不完全的统计，三十四万四千三百七十三名农民已经减租。
    据一九五二年不完全的统计，三十一万七千公顷的公地已分配给解放区、游击根据地和游击区的农民。
    在部分地区实行了减息。此外并设立了当地人民的信用贷款和互助金以帮助无地或少地的农民。
    由于取得了这些成就，农民的生活条件已经改善。革命前，每年都发生饥荒。但是，八月革命以后，虽然战争还在进行，在绝大部分解放区饥荒已差不多完全绝迹。
    可是，政府在实行土地政策的过程中是遭到困难的。
    保大—阮文心傀儡集团、反动封建地主和农村恶霸一直在阻挠破坏土地政策的实行。
    三、全面动员农民群众执行政府的土地政策
    一九五三年年初，胡志明主席、越南劳动党、越南政府和越南国民联合战线提出了积极加强农民的力量的任务：全面发动群众推翻反动的封建卖国分子和农村恶霸，粉碎地主阶级的政治力量，削弱他们的经济力量，部分满足劳动农民经济要求，并保证他们得到政治上的地位。
    现行的土地政策具体地包括下列几点：
    彻底实现减租（包括地主还没有减低的，或者还没有按照政府的法令减低的补偿地租在内）并实行减息；
    把属于法国殖民者和越南卖国贼的土地无限期地分配给无地或少地的农民；
    把公地无限期地分配给无地或少地的农民；
    规定租契，禁止地主任意收回土地。
    为实行这一政策，越南劳动党和越南政府已派了两个工作团到越北联区（越南北部）和第四联区（中越北部）去发动群众。在二十二个试点村中已得到了辉煌的胜利。在越南劳动党的领导下，劳动农民已部分地粉碎了地主阶级的政治势力，取得了政治上的地位。在这些农村中，人民的政权和农会有了很大发展，并已真正掌握在劳动农民手中。此外，封建地主的经济力量已被削弱了。在第一阶段的发动群众运动中，已没收八百多公顷原来属于反动的封建地主的土地，并已分配给这二十二个农村中的无地或少地的农民。
    这个胜利大大地鼓舞了农民努力增加生产，使他们更积极地参加抗战工作。在完成了发动农民群众工作的农村中，农民们踊跃地完纳了农业税，并争先大批报名参加人民军或民工队。各地成立了新的互助组。在太原省的六个农村中，有一千七百四十三户农民购买了新的农具和耕畜。
    一九五三年九月，越南劳动党和人民政府在将近两百个农村中展开了第二阶段的发动群众运动。由于吸取了第一阶段的经验，第二阶段的运动取得了辉煌的成就，关于这些成就的总结工作目前即将完成。即将展开的第三阶段的发动群众运动将在更大的规模上进行。
    目前，发动群众执行政府的土地政策的运动，鼓舞了全国各地人民增加生产并鼓舞他们更加积极地参加各种抗战工作。越南农村的面貌有了新的变化，人民民主政权正在日益巩固。
    随着抗战的不断进展，越南劳动党和人民政府的土地政策也在逐步实行，“耕者有其田”这句口号不久就将成为现实。在胡志明主席、越南劳动党和人民政府的英明领导下，越南劳动农民正在把他们的反对帝国主义、反对封建势力的革命和武装斗争推向彻底胜利。（根据越南通讯社材料）
