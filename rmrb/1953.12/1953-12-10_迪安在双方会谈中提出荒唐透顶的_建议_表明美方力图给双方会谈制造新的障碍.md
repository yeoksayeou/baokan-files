Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 8th -- Special correspondent Jiang Nan reports: Dean today brought all his old and unacceptable arguments into his "suggestions" for indefinite delay, causing the talks to regress. Representative Qi Shifu immediately and decisively rejected Dean's so-called "suggestions," believing that this "suggestion" "only piles up clichés without advancing an inch or changing a single word." Qi Shifu said: "Clichés plus clichés are still clichés. We believe that the real intention of your suggestion is to delay and deceive."

Dean's tricks to delay time in his "suggestion" show that Dean has returned to where the talks began. The only difference is that his delaying tactics are now exposed to the public. The obstacles created by Dean in his "suggestion" include the following points:

	(1) Explicitly lists the Soviet Union as being on the side of the belligerent nations.

	(2) Retains the insulting restrictions on neutral nations. According to Dean's "suggestion," they can only speak on an agenda item "when both parties unanimously agree to discuss an item on the agenda in an order of debate and speech acceptable to both parties," and they "shall not make formal motions or suggestions." In short, neutral nations can only do what Washington and Syngman Rhee want them to do. Dean did not even propose a specific neutral nation in his suggestion.

	(3) Insists on Geneva, proposed by the U.S. some months ago, as the meeting location.

	(4) Insists on a meeting time "plan" in the indefinite future within forty-two days after the current talks end. According to this "plan," even if the current talks reach an agreement this week, the political conference will be delayed until after January 22nd, allowing Washington's "time-released vault" for sabotaging the armistice and detaining prisoners of war to activate.

	(5) Retains the U.S. voting procedure, allowing the U.S. to exclusively control the votes of the other sixteen countries on its side and leaving Syngman Rhee room to tear up any agreement.

Qi Shifu exposed and refuted the main obstructive features of Dean's "suggestion." He said: "The neutrality of the Soviet Union is a fact and a truth, therefore it is undeniable and indisputable. Under no circumstances will we allow the distortion of facts and truth." Qi Shifu also reiterated the firm position of the Korean and Chinese side in insisting that neutral nations have the right to fully discuss the agenda items agreed upon by both parties.

Qi Shifu pointed out that the U.S. implied opposition to New Delhi as the meeting location on the grounds that it lacks "long-term experience in holding meetings" and "simultaneous translation equipment and experienced secretariats," which shows that the U.S. looks down on India. He questioned Dean: "Didn't your side propose places like Istanbul, Bangkok, etc.? Do these places have better 'simultaneous translation equipment and experienced secretariats' than New Delhi?"

In addition to these obstacles that can be used to indefinitely delay the talks, Dean has added new obstacles. An obvious example is that his "suggestion" stipulates that the Secretary-General of the United Nations should provide secretaries and translators for the political conference and designate representatives to draft the rules of procedure for the political conference together with both parties. Qi Shifu condemned this as an "outrageous" idea. He asked Dean: Have you forgotten that your side claims to be the representative of the United Nations? Have you forgotten that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China are not represented in the United Nations, and that some of the personnel employed by the Secretariat—its so-called administrative body—are from the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang? Dean was speechless.

Another trick in Dean's "suggestion" to delay time is the stipulation that the agenda of the political conference should be determined by the conference itself. Qi Shifu pointed out that this is to enable the U.S. to continue to use delaying tactics in the political conference in the future. Qi Shifu continued, the four agenda items proposed by the Korean and Chinese side are entirely based on the armistice agreement.

Dean's "suggestion" in fact widened the differences between the two sides. However, the U.S. representative to the United Nations, Lodge, attempted to deceive the world, saying that "there are indications that the differences are narrowing." Dean's advisor, Young, also told reporters after wasting yesterday's meeting time that the meeting meant "a step forward." Obviously, the U.S. is deliberately spreading an optimistic atmosphere to cover up the U.S.'s delaying tactics and purposes. Dean's "suggestion" put forward today shattered the U.S.'s so-called "progress" lie, showing that the U.S.'s delaying tactics are serious, and confirms that the U.S. intends to make the current talks "continue for a long time, perhaps even into early spring," as Dean assured Syngman Rhee.

### 迪安在双方会谈中提出荒唐透顶的“建议”  表明美方力图给双方会谈制造新的障碍

    迪安在双方会谈中提出荒唐透顶的“建议”
    表明美方力图给双方会谈制造新的障碍
    【新华社开城八日电】本社特派记者江南报道：迪安今天把他的全部陈旧的不可接受的论点搬进他的进行无限期拖延的“建议”中去，而使会谈开倒车。奇石福代表立即断然拒绝了迪安的所谓  “建议”，认为这个“建议”“只是堆积陈词滥调，而一寸未进，一句未改”。奇石福说：“陈词滥调加上陈词滥调仍然是陈词滥调。我们认为你的建议的真正用意是进行拖延和欺骗。”
    迪安的“建议”中的拖延时间的花样表明迪安已回到会谈开始的地方。唯一的不同点是他的拖延手段现在已暴露在公众面前。迪安在他的“建议”中制造的障碍包括以下几点：
      （一）明白地把苏联列在交战双方国家一边。
      （二）保留中立国的侮辱性的限制。根据迪安的“建议”，它们只有“在双方一致同意的情况下按照可以为双方所接受的辩论和发言的次序讨论议程中的一个项目时”，才能就那个项目发言，它们“不得提出正式动议或建议”。简单地说，就是只有华盛顿和李承晚要中立国怎样做，中立国才能怎样做。迪安在他的建议中甚至没有提出一个具体的中立国。
    （三）坚持以美方在若干月前提出的日内瓦作为会议地点。
    （四）坚持在目前会谈结束后四十二天以内这个无限期的将来举行会议的时间“方案”。根据这个“方案”，即使目前的会谈在本星期内获得协议，政治会议也要拖到一月二十二日以后，而让华盛顿破坏停战、扣留战俘的“定时开启的保险库”开动起来。
    （五）保留美方的表决程序，使美国能够独占在它自己一方的另外十六个国家的表决权，并给李承晚留下撕毁任何协议的余地。
    奇石福揭露并驳斥了迪安的“建议”的主要的阻挠性的特征。他说：“苏联的中立是一个事实和真理，因此是无可否认和不容置辩的。我们在任何情况下决不容许歪曲事实和真理。”奇石福并重申朝中方面坚持中立国有权参加双方同意的议程项目的充分讨论的坚定立场。
    奇石福指出，美国暗示反对以新德里作为会议地点，理由是它缺乏“举行会议方面的长期经验”和“同时进行翻译的设备与有经验的秘书处”，这表明美方是瞧不起印度的。他质问迪安说：“你方不是提出过伊斯坦布尔、曼谷等等地方吗？难道这些地方有比新德里来得好的‘同时进行翻译的设备与有经验的秘书处’吗？”
    除了这些可以用来无限期拖延会谈的障碍以外，迪安还添上了新的障碍。一个明显的例子就是他的“建议”中规定要求联合国秘书长为政治会议提供秘书与翻译人员，并指定代表和双方一起拟定政治会议的程序规则。奇石福斥责这是一种“荒唐透顶”的想法。他问迪安：难道你方忘记你方自称为联合国方面的代表吗？难道你方忘记朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国在联合国中没有代表，秘书处——它的所谓行政机构——雇用的人员有一部分是蒋介石匪帮的人吗？迪安哑口无言。
    迪安的“建议”中的另一个拖延时间的新花样是规定政治会议的议程由会议本身决定。奇石福指出，这是为了使美方在将来能够在政治会议中继续使用拖延手段。奇石福接着说，朝中方面提出的四项议程是完全以停战协定为根据的。
    迪安的“建议”事实上扩大了双方之间的分歧。但是美国出席联合国的代表洛奇却企图欺骗世界，说甚么“有迹象表明分歧正在缩小”。迪安的顾问杨格在浪费了昨天的会议时间以后也对记者说，这次会议意味着“向前走了一步”。显然美方是故意散布乐观空气来掩盖美方的拖延手段和目的。迪安今天提出的“建议”粉碎了美方的所谓“有进展”的谎言，它表明美方的拖延时间的做法是严重的，并证实美方打算使目前的会谈“继续进行一段长时间，甚至可能进行到初春”，像迪安向李承晚所保证的那样。
