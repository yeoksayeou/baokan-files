    Ninghe Xin Yi Village Agricultural Production Cooperative Writes to Anshan Steel Workers
    Your Production Victories Inspire Us to Advance

    To all the staff and workers of the Iron Smelting Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company:

    We often read in the newspapers about the new achievements you have made in socialist industrial construction. On December 4th, you completed the first year's production plan of the state's first Five-Year Plan twenty-seven and a half days ahead of schedule. Your achievements have greatly inspired all our cooperative members, and everyone is willing to learn from you.

    Our cooperative has 96 households, and this year we planted 1,740 mu of paddy rice, achieving a bumper harvest, with a total of 1,221,850 jin of rice. After studying the General Line, our cooperative held a meeting to discuss the issue of selling grain. Everyone realized that it was the Communist Party's leadership that organized us and enabled us to harvest more grain. Our cooperative must take the lead in selling grain to the state. Only when the state has grain can it meet the needs of cities and industrial and mining areas. Cooperative member Wu Yongkun said: "Now we are advancing towards socialism, and the state needs to build many factories. Only when there are more factories and industry develops can we manufacture large quantities of agricultural machinery and tractors for the peasants. To support the country's industrial construction, we must sell all the surplus grain to the state." He Xiguang said: "Workers labor in factories to supply the state with products, and our agricultural products should also be sold to the state. Only in this way can we build socialism." In the end, everyone unanimously agreed that, in addition to paying public grain, retaining seeds for next year's planting, and providing for our own consumption, we would sell the remaining 1,010,000 jin of rice to the state. Now, not only have we sold all our surplus grain, but we have also motivated the surrounding mutual aid teams and individual farmers to sell 160,000 jin of rice to the state. With the money from selling the grain, we have not only exchanged it for many production tools and daily necessities, but also deposited the remaining 207.5 million yuan into the national bank, so that the state can circulate construction funds.

    At present, we are carrying out a winter manure accumulation campaign and studying advanced agricultural science and technology, striving to achieve high yields, low costs, and increased grain production next year, so as to better support industrial construction and support you.

    Comrade workers, the achievements we have made this year on the agricultural production front, in addition to the help and leadership of the Party and the government, have also been greatly encouraged by your many new achievements in industrial production. We believe that you will create even greater achievements in the second year of the Five-Year Plan, inspiring us to move towards the goal of agricultural collectivization.

    We wish you ever forward progress in production! And enduring health!

    宁河新一村农业生产合作社写信给鞍钢工人
    你们在生产方面的胜利鼓舞着我们前进鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂全体职工同志们：
    我们经常在报纸上看到你们在进行社会主义工业建设方面创造的新成绩，本月四日你们又提前二十七天半全面完成了国家第一个五年计划中第一年的生产计划，你们的成绩对我们全体社员有很大的鼓舞作用，大家都愿意向你们学习。
    我们全社九十六户，今年种了一千七百四十亩水稻，得到大丰收，总共打了一百二十二万一千八百五十斤稻谷。学习了总路线以后，我们全社开了一个会，讨论卖粮食的问题，大家都认识到：共产党领导咱组织起来，才多打了粮食，咱合作社一定要带头把粮食卖给国家。国家有了粮食，才能供给城市和工矿区的需要。社员武永琨说：“现在我们正向社会主义前进，国家需要修建很多的工厂；只有工厂多了，工业发展了，才能给农民制造大批的农业机器和拖拉机。为了支援国家工业建设，咱们就必须把剩余的粮食全部卖给国家。”何锡光说：“工人在工厂里劳动把产品供应国家，咱们田间劳动的产品也应该卖给国家，只有这样才能建设社会主义。”最后大家一致同意除去缴公粮、留下明年种籽和自吃的外，把余下的一百零一万斤稻谷全部卖给国家。现在我们不光自己卖了全部余粮，还带动了周围的互助组和单干户卖给国家十六万斤稻谷。卖粮的钱，我们除了换回很多生产用具和日用品，又将剩余的两亿零七十五万元全部存入国家银行，好让国家周转建设资金。
    目前我们正开展冬季积肥运动和学习先进农业科学技术，争取明年做到产量高，成本低，增产更多的粮食，更好地支援工业建设，支援你们。
    职工同志们：我们今年在农业生产战线上所得到的成绩，除了党和政府的帮助和领导之外，你们在工业生产上的许多新成就也给了我们很大的鼓舞。我们相信你们在进行五年计划第二年的生产中，一定会创造出比今年更大的成绩，鼓舞我们朝着农业集体化的目标前进。
    祝你们生产永远前进！身体永远健康！
        河北宁河县新一村农业生产合作社
                                    全体社员
