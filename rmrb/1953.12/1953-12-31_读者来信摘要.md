Reader's Letters Digest

    During the Completion of Basic Construction Projects, Material Recovery Should Be Done Well

    A reader from the Supervision Section of the Northeast Basic Construction Investment Bank writes: Currently, most basic construction projects in the Northeast region (except for those under winter construction) have been completed or are in the process of completion. At this time, doing a good job of material recovery, inventory, and disposal during the completion of projects is an important task. Recently, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Northeast Administrative Committee issued a notice requiring all construction units in the region to pay attention to this work.

    Currently, many units are doing a good job in this area. For example, the Fourth Construction Zone of the First Engineering Company of the Electrical Industry Administration has done a good job of material recovery, which not only ensures the material supply for the unit's uncompleted projects, but also transferred recovered materials worth 3.6 billion yuan to support other construction zones. They not only organized and properly stored the recovered materials, but also tried to repair and utilize waste materials and scraps as much as possible. They recovered 18 tons of scrap iron, 20,000 cement bags, and 300 usable soil baskets, and used waste materials and scraps to make many small tools such as small buckets and slurry boxes. The value of the recovered waste materials and the repaired and usable waste materials reached more than 500 million yuan.

    However, some units do not pay enough attention to material recovery. The No. 204 construction site of the Shenyang Civil Engineering and Construction Company has completed 95% of its project, but materials and tools are everywhere on the construction site, and there are still many scaffolding planks and six-foot poles in the waste piles. The construction site cadres believe that "the building is built, the task is completed," and "what does it matter if a little bit is lost in such a big project." This idea is obviously contrary to the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy. Now is the time when construction is suspended in winter, and it is hoped that construction units with similar situations will quickly take effective measures to earnestly do a good job of material recovery.

    When a Project is About to End, Safety Work Must Also Be Emphasized

    Reader Zhang Xiaoliang writes: On basic construction sites, many casualties often occur when projects are about to end. In the past two years, the Shanxi Provincial Engineering Company has had cases of casualties due to the negligence of the cadres in charge of the construction site when the project was about to end. Unfortunately, these past lessons have not aroused people's vigilance. Recently, a similar incident occurred again at the C construction site of the No. 802 construction site of the Shanxi Provincial Engineering Company.

    The building at the construction site was basically completed, and the outer scaffolding had been removed, but the cornice gray strips had not yet been nailed on. The construction site erected some temporary scaffolding outside the building, and the cadres knew that it was dangerous to have no railings or protective nets on the scaffolding, but they thought that "this is not a major project," "it won't take long, just make do with it," and "there won't be any problems," so they didn't care whether the scaffolding poles were tied firmly or met the specifications. The No. 802 construction site had not had any casualties in the past year, but in the two days before the project was about to end, three workers fell from the scaffolding in succession, resulting in casualties. The woodworking team leader Li Wucheng was killed, and workers Mo Shoulu and four others were injured, causing significant losses to the country.

    The idea of neglecting safety issues when a project is nearing completion may also exist in other construction units. The accident at the C construction site of the No. 802 construction site of the Shanxi Provincial Engineering Company should be a painful lesson.

    Payment of 60,000 Jin of Firewood Unattended

    Li Wanhua of the Beijing Cooperative General Office writes: On November 19th, one of the items on the agenda of the joint meeting of section chiefs of the Dongdan District United Cooperative of the Beijing Cooperative General Office was: "In 1952, our cooperative owed the Beijing Materials Company (now renamed Beijing Timber Factory) of Majiabao, Yongdingmenwai, 60,000 jin of firewood. Although we have repeatedly tried to repay it, we have been unable to do so because no one in the company is willing to accept it. How should this be handled?"

    It turned out that in September 1952, the Dongdan District United Cooperative purchased 60,000 jin of firewood from the Beijing Materials Company, and it was agreed at the time that the payment would be made as soon as the goods were picked up. In mid-September, the Dongdan District United Cooperative went to pay the bill three times in a row according to the agreement, but the company said each time: "The person in charge is not here, others don't deal with it, come back another day!" So, the Dongdan District United Cooperative sent an official letter requesting a quick resolution to this issue. But after more than ten days, there was no response. Then, the Dongdan District United Cooperative sent someone to urge them, and repeatedly urged them by telephone. The company gave a helpless answer: "This matter is difficult to handle. Our company has been divided into six or seven companies. It is impossible to find out who the person in charge was at that time and which unit they have been assigned to now. If the original person in charge cannot be found, how can the payment be collected?" Since then, the Dongdan District United Cooperative has called to urge them every month when settling accounts upon seeing the "firewood fee payable" item, but each time the call was like a stone sinking into the sea.

    Now, the Dongdan District United Cooperative has decided to transfer this matter to the Beijing Municipal People's Supervisory Committee for handling. We hope that the Beijing Municipal People's Supervisory Committee will exercise its supervisory powers and clarify this account.

    A Delayed Instruction

    Reader Jie Feng writes: In October, our Qiqihar Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant received a circular from the Locomotive and Rolling Stock Industry Administration Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building of the Central Government, forwarding a notice issued by the First Ministry of Machine Building on September 9th regarding the inspection of project quality issues. Attached to the front of the circular was an instruction saying: "We are hereby forwarding the Ministry of Machine Building's Basic Construction and Implementation Document No. 358 as follows. It is hoped that you will immediately notify the relevant departments under your jurisdiction to be vigilant. In addition to strengthening intermediate inspections, please report the results of the basic construction quality inspection over the years to the Bureau by the end of September."

    The instruction required us to report the inspection results to the Bureau by the end of September, but the instruction was not delivered until October 16th. We only thought that the official document was delayed on the way and quickly investigated the reason. But after careful examination, the Bureau issued this instruction on October 10th. Is it possible to issue an instruction on October 10th requiring the lower level to report the inspection results to the Bureau by the end of September? Since the Bureau is so eager to have the lower level report the inspection results, why did they keep this circular for a month before forwarding it?

专栏：读者来信摘要

    读者来信摘要
    基本建设工程结束期间  应该做好料具回收工作
    东北区基本建设投资银行监察科一读者来信：目前东北地区大部分基本建设工程（除冬季施工者外）已经结束或正在办理结束。在这个时候，做好工程结束期间的料具收回、清点、处理工作，是一项重要的任务。最近，东北行政委员会财政经济委员会已发出通知，要求全区各建筑单位重视这项工作。
    现在，不少单位对这项工作做得较好。如电器工业管理局第一工程公司四工区做好了料具收回工作，不仅保证本单位未完工程的料具供应，并将价值三十六亿元的回收料具调出支援其他工区。他们对回收的料具不仅进行整理和妥善保管，而且对废料和零碎材料也尽量加以整修利用。他们这次计回收废铁十八吨、水泥袋子二万个、能用的土篮子三百副，并利用废料和零星材料做了小水桶、浆盒子等很多小工具。收回的废料和整修后可以利用的废料价值即达五亿余元。
    但是，也有一些单位对料具回收工作重视不够。沈阳土木建筑工程公司二○四工地工程已完成百分之九十五，但工地里到处都是材料和工具，废料堆里还有很多跳板和六尺杠子等。工地干部认为“大楼盖起，任务完成”，“这么大的工程流落点算什么”。这种思想显然是和增产节约的精神相违背的。现在，正是冬季停止施工的时候，希望有类似情况的建筑单位迅速采取有效措施，切实搞好料具回收工作。
    在工程将要结束时  也必须重视安全工作
    读者张效良来信：在基本建设工地上，不少伤亡事故往往是在工程将要结束的时候发生的。山西省工程公司在前年和去年都出现过因为工地负责干部在工程将结束时思想麻痹起来而发生伤亡事故的情况。不幸的是，过去的这些教训并没有引起人们的警惕。最近，山西省工程公司八○二工地丙场工地又发生了类似事件。
    该工地的楼房已基本上完工了，外边的架也拆了，但是还有檐板灰条没有钉上。工地又在楼房外边搭了些临时脚手架，干部们明知道架上没有栏杆防护网是很危险的，但他们认为“这不是主要工程了”，“时间不长，迁就一下就完了”，“不会出问题的”，所以对架杆绑得牢不牢、合不合规格，就不以为意了。八○二工地一年来也没有发生什么伤亡事故，可是，在将近工程结束的两天，连续发生三起工人从架上掉下来的伤亡事故，摔死木工组长李五成，摔伤工人默守禄等四人，给国家造成重大的损失。
    在工程接近结束而忽视安全问题的思想，在其它建筑单位可能也存在。山西省工程公司八○二工地丙场工地的事故，应该是一个沉痛的教训。
    无人受理的六万斤劈柴款
    北京市合作总社李万骅来信：十一月十九日北京市合作总社东单区联合社科长联席会议的议题中，有这样一项：“一九五二年我社欠永定门外马家堡北京市器材公司（现改为北京市木材厂）的六万斤劈柴款，虽曾再三偿还，但因该公司无人受理，无法还出，应如何处理？”
    原来在一九五二年九月，东单区联合社曾向北京市器材公司购买劈柴六万斤，当时议定提完货就交款。九月中旬，东单区联合社根据协议，接连三次去付款，该公司每次都说：“经手人不在，别人不接头，改一天再来吧！”于是，东单区联合社就去了一封公函，要求迅速处理这个问题。但隔了十多天也没有得到答复。接着东单区联合社派人催问，又连续用电话催促，该公司来了一个无可奈何的回答：“这事可难办啦，我们这个公司分成六、七个公司了，当时经手人是谁，现在分到那个单位都没法查考。原经手人找不到，货款怎能收呢？”以后，东单区联合社每月底结账时一看到“应付柴费”这个科目，就打电话催问，可是每次催问都是石沉大海。
    现在，东单区联合社决定把这件事转请北京市人民监察委员会处理。我们希望北京市人民监察委员会执行人民监察的职权，弄清这一笔账。
    一件迟发的指示
    读者捷锋来信：十月份，我们齐齐哈尔机车车辆制造厂接到中央第一机械工业部机车车辆工业管理局转发第一机械工业部九月九日发出的关于检查工程质量问题的通报。在通报前面，附了一个指示说：“兹抄发部机基施字第三五八号通报如下，希即通知所属有关部门，引为警惕，除令加强中间检查外，并将年来基本建设质量检查结果于九月底以前报局。”
    指示中要我们九月底以前将检查结果报局，而指示却是在十月十六日送到的。我们只以为公文是在路上耽误了，赶忙追查一下原因。可是仔细一看，局里发这个指示的日子就是十月十日。十月十日发指示要下级在九月底把检查结果报局，这是可能的吗？既然局里这样急于要下级汇报检查结果，他们为什么把这个通报积压了一个月才转发呢？
