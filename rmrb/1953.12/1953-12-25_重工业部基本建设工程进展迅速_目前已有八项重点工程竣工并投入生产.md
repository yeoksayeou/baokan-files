Rapid Progress in Basic Construction Projects of the Ministry of Heavy Industry
    Currently, Eight Key Projects Have Been Completed and Put into Production
    The basic construction projects of the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry are progressing rapidly. According to monthly statistics from all 213 construction units, as of the end of November, the accumulated construction and installation work completed reached 91.33% of the annual plan. Classified by the completion status of each construction unit, 43 construction units have completed or exceeded their annual plans, 66 units have completed more than 90% of their annual plans, and 51 units have completed between 80% and 90% of their annual plans. The total of these three categories accounts for more than three-quarters of all units. The monthly progress of construction and installation projects of the Ministry of Heavy Industry in November was 12.9% of the annual plan. If progress continues at this rate, the ministry's basic construction plan for this year can be fully completed, and it is estimated that some projects will exceed their annual plans.
    The completion of the 25 key projects of the Ministry of Heavy Industry this year is progressing well. Currently, the completed and put into production projects include the seamless steel pipe plant of Anshan Iron and Steel, the large rolling mill, the second automated blast furnace, the two blast furnaces of Longyan Iron Mine, the six blast furnaces of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant, the copper electrolysis workshop of Shenyang Smelter, the Northeast No. 8 Cement Plant, and the Datun Concentrator of Yunnan Tin Company, totaling eight items. Shandong 501 Factory is currently undergoing trial operation, and all projects of the Northeast Institute of Technology directly under the Ministry have been completed this year. In addition, eight items have completed more than 90% of their annual plans, and the rest, except for two items that have completed about 70% of their plans, have all completed more than 80%. It is expected that by the end of the year, all key projects will be able to complete or exceed their annual plans.

    重工业部基本建设工程进展迅速
    目前已有八项重点工程竣工并投入生产
    中央重工业部基本建设工程进展迅速。根据全部二百一十三个建设单位的月报统计，到十一月底，建筑安装工程已累计完成全年计划的百分之九十一点三三。以各建设单位完成情况分类，有四十三个建设单位完成或提前完成了全年计划，有六十六个单位完成全年计划百分之九十以上，已完成全年计划在百分之八十至九十之间的共有五十一个单位，三类合计占全部的四分之三以上。重工业部十一月份建筑安装工程月进度为全年计划的百分之十二点九，如能按此速度进展，该部今年基本建设计划可全部完成，估计有部分工程将超额完成全年计划。
    重工业部今年二十五项重点工程完成计划情况都比较好，目前已竣工并投入生产的有鞍钢无缝钢管厂、大型轧钢厂、第二座自动化炼铁炉、龙烟铁矿两座炼铁炉、马鞍山铁厂六座炼铁炉、沈阳冶炼厂铜电解车间、东北第八水泥厂、云南锡业公司大屯选矿厂等八项；山东五○一厂正在试车，部直属的东北工学院今年工程已全部完工。此外，已完成全年计划百分之九十以上者有八项，其余除有两项完成计划在百分之七十左右外，都已完成百分之八十以上。预计到年底，各项重点工程大都能完成或超额完成全年计划。
