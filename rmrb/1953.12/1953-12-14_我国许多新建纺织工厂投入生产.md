Many newly built textile factories in various parts of China have been put into production, creating a large amount of wealth for the country. Various types of fabrics have been successively transported to rural areas across the country to supply the vast number of farmers.

Since liberation, our country has paid close attention to the textile industry, which has the greatest impact on the national economy and the people's lives. In the cotton, wool, and hemp producing areas of Central South, Northwest, North China, and Northeast China, many new types of cotton textile factories and several textile factories for wool spinning, printing and dyeing, silk reeling, silk fabrics, and hemp have been built. In addition, many textile factories have been expanded. Since 1950, when our country expanded the textile industry, the number of spindles has increased by 15.5 percent and the total number of looms has increased by 21 percent in just four years up to this year. According to preliminary statistics, twenty-one of the more than thirty newly built or largely expanded textile factories have been put into production. The state-owned Zhejiang Hemp Textile Factory, the local state-owned Shijiazhuang Textile Factory, the Shijiazhuang Weaving and Dyeing Factory, and the Tianxin Wool Textile Factory, built in the ethnic minority area of Tianzhu Autonomous Region in Gansu Province, were put into production as early as 1951. The factories put into production last year include: the state-owned Northwest No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, the state-owned Handan No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, the state-owned Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, the local state-owned Nanjing Yarn Factory, the Liaoxi Printing and Dyeing Factory, China's first automated state-owned Harbin Flax Textile Factory, and the Xinjiang July 1st Cotton Textile Factory located on the northwest border of the motherland. The ten factories put into production this year are: the state-owned Zhengzhou No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, the state-owned Northwest No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, the state-owned Chongqing 610 Automatic Loom Factory, the largest loom factory in Southwest China, as well as the Yunnan Automatic Loom Weaving Factory, the Xi'an Cotton Textile Factory, the New Northwest Printing and Dyeing Factory, the Liaodong Silk Spinning Factory, the Hangzhou Silk Factory, the Shandong People's Silk Reeling Factory and other local state-owned factories, and the jointly state-private Tangshan Huaxin No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory.

Due to the establishment of these new factories and the continuous expansion and improvement of old factories, the textile industry of New China has undergone significant changes. First of all, the output of textile industrial products has greatly increased. This year, the state is supplying the people with more fabrics, woolens, serge, and yarn than in any previous year. The output of cotton yarn and cotton cloth has increased even faster, more than doubling this year compared to 1949. In 1952, cotton yarn increased by 51 percent compared to the highest historical annual output; cotton cloth increased by 67 percent. Taking the state-owned Northwest No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory as an example, the completion of this factory doubled the number of spindles and increased the number of looms by nearly four times in state-owned textile factories in the Northwest region. The cotton cloth it produces each year can provide clothing for 4.5 million people. The locally state-owned Liaodong Silk Spinning Factory, newly built in Liaodong Province, can weave high-grade clothing materials such as silk serge, riding breeches, khaki, herringbone, and military academy cloth, as well as various thick and thin plushes. It can weave more than one million yards of beautiful and durable silk fabrics each year to meet the needs of the people. The factories that have already started operation have created a large amount of wealth for the country. According to calculations from only seven state-owned factories, including the state-owned Handan No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, Northwest No. 1 and No. 2 Cotton Textile Factories, Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, Zhengzhou No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, Harbin Flax Factory, and Zhejiang Hemp Textile Factory, they can create more than 1,556 billion yuan of wealth for the country this year alone (of which two factories have been in operation for less than a year). Among them, the state-owned Northwest No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, since it started production on May 17 last year, will create more than 540 billion yuan of wealth and produce nearly 1.3 million bolts of cloth in a year and a half by the end of this year. The factory once set a new national record of less than 80 yarn breakages per spindle, and the factory's spinning workshop was therefore named a model spinning workshop in the national textile industry.

The various fabrics produced by the textile factories that have already started operation have been transported to and are continuously being transported to rural areas across the country, supplying the vast number of farmers. The fertile Guanzhong Plain is a well-known cotton-producing area in the Northwest. In the early days after liberation, more than six-fifths of the cotton produced locally was transported to textile factories in coastal areas to be woven into cloth and then transported back. Many local farmers made and dyed their own coarse homespun cloth. But things are different now. Calculated by population, in 1949, the Northwest region produced enough cloth for an average of about one bolt per sixty people. This year, according to planned output, about one bolt can be distributed to every fifteen people. When the Alliance brand 12-pound fine cloth produced by the newly built state-owned Northwest No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory was delivered to the hands of the vast number of farmers, it received good reviews from the farmers. They said, "This cloth is flat, white, fine, and dense, and the price per bolt is 6,000 yuan cheaper than the cloth transported from other regions!" In early August this year, the newly built New Northwest Printing and Dyeing Factory also started production. The Five-Star Flower Serge, the first product successfully printed and dyed by the factory, was even more welcomed by the farmers in the Northwest. According to statistics from the Northwest Branch of the China Cotton Yarn and Fabric Company, the sales of textiles in 1952 increased by more than four times compared to 1950, and this year it is expected to increase to six or seven times. A Tibetan named Dao Jiji, before liberation, had no pants to wear, nor did four other members of his family, and walked barefoot. Now, due to the continuous development of the textile industry in the Northwest and the improvement of the lives of the Tibetan people, his family made 29 new clothes last year, and there were two pieces of material that had not been sewn, and he bought 15 new pairs of boots. The newly built and expanded textile factories in the Northwest region are also producing twill and various brightly colored floral fabrics for the people of the Northwest, which have never been produced in the Northwest region before. Handan, Hebei, is also a well-known cotton-producing area. The state-owned Handan No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, facing the vast rural areas, has produced hundreds of thousands of bolts of cloth to meet the needs of local farmers.

More and more larger-scale textile factories are continuing to be built. There are currently eight cotton textile factories under construction, including the state-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, Shijiazhuang No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, state-owned Northwest No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory, Zhengzhou No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory; and the locally state-owned Liaoxi Cotton Textile Factory, Xiangtan Cotton Textile Factory, and Jiangxi Cotton Textile Factory. In addition, a new-style bleaching and dyeing factory is being built in Yunnan, and the printing and dyeing factory attached to the Chongqing 610 Factory is also under active construction. A wool spinning factory being built in Ningxia Province is nearing completion. In addition, there are several silk weaving, knitting, and other factories, as well as two flax raw material factories being built near Harbin. At the same time, more than 20 textile factories (including joint state-private and private) are being expanded or renovated this year. Next year, four larger-scale state-owned cotton textile factories will be constructed in Beijing, Shijiazhuang, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, and other places.

China's textile industry is developing step by step to meet the growing needs of the people's lives amid the great growth of the national economy.

    我国许多新建纺织工厂投入生产
    各地许多新建的纺织工厂纷纷投入生产，为国家创造了大量财富，各种布匹已陆续运往各地农村，供应广大农民。
    解放以来，我们国家对和人民经济生活关系最大的纺织工业，给予了密切的注意。在中南、西北、华北、东北的产棉或产毛、产麻地区，新建了许多新型的棉纺织厂和若干个毛纺、印染、绢丝、绸、麻等纺织工厂，此外，还有许多纺织工厂进行了扩建。我国自一九五○年扩建纺织工业以来，到今年止，在短短的四年中，纱锭就增加了百分之十五点五；布机总数增加了百分之二十一。据目前初步统计，在新建或较大规模扩建的三十多个纺织工厂中，已有二十一个工厂投入了生产。国营浙江麻纺织厂、地方国营石家庄纺织厂、石家庄织染厂和建立在少数民族地区——甘肃省天祝自治区的天新毛纺织厂等早在一九五一年就投入了生产。去年投入生产的厂计有：国营西北第一棉纺织厂、国营邯郸第一棉纺织厂、国营武汉第一棉纺织厂、地方国营南京纱厂、辽西印染厂和我国第一个自动化的国营哈尔滨亚麻纺织厂以及在祖国西北边陲的新疆七一棉纺织厂。今年投入生产的十个工厂是：国营郑州第二棉纺织厂国营西北第二棉纺织厂和西南第一座最大的布机厂——国营重庆六一零自动布机厂，以及云南自动布机织布厂、西安棉纺织厂、新西北印染厂、辽东绢纺厂、杭州绸厂、山东人民制丝厂等地方国营工厂和公私合营的唐山华新第二棉纺织厂等。
    由于这些新厂的建立和旧厂的不断扩大和改进，新中国的纺织工业已起了十分重大的变化。首先是纺织工业品的产量大大增加，今年国家供给广大人民的布匹、呢绒、哔叽、绒线等比以往任何一年都多，棉纱和棉布的产量增加得更快，今年比一九四九年增加了一倍以上。一九五二年棉纱比历史最高年产量增加百分之五十一；棉布增加百分之六十七。以国营西北第一棉纺织厂为例，由于该厂的建成，就使西北区国营纺织厂的纱锭增加了一倍，布机增加近四倍。它每年所产的棉布，可供给四百五十万人每人一套衣料。在辽东省新建成的地方国营辽东绢纺厂，可以织丝哔叽、马裤呢、小卡叽、人字呢、军校呢等高级衣料和织各色厚薄长毛绒，它每年可织造一百多万码美丽坚固的丝织物，供给人民的需要。已经开工的各厂，已为国家创造了大量财富。仅据国营邯郸第一棉纺织厂、西北第一、第二棉纺织厂、武汉第一棉纺织厂、郑州第二棉纺织厂和哈尔滨亚麻厂、浙江麻纺织厂等七个国营工厂的计算，只今年一年（其中有两个厂不到一年），就可给国家创造一万五千五百六十多亿元的财富。其中国营西北第一棉纺织厂自去年五月十七日开工生产以来，到今年年底，一年半的时间内，就可给国家创造财富五千四百多亿元，生产近一百三十万匹布。该厂细纱断头曾创八十根以下的全国新纪录，该厂纺纱工场因而被评为全国纺织工业的模范纺纱工场。
    已开工各纺织工厂所生产的各种布匹，已经运往并正不断地运至各地农村，供应广大的农民。富饶的关中平原，是西北有名的产棉区，解放初期，当地出产的棉花有六分之五以上运往沿海地区的纺织厂中织成布匹，然后再运回来。很多地方农民都是自制自染，穿粗劣的土布。可是现在不同了，如按人口算，一九四九年西北区生产的布匹，平均约六十个人才能分到一匹布，今年按计划产量算，约十五个人就可分到一匹了。当新建的国营西北第一棉纺织厂生产的联盟牌十二磅细布送到广大农民的手里时，得到了农民们的好评。他们说：“这种布又平又白又细密，每匹布的价钱还比外区运来的布便宜六千元哩！”今年八月初，新建的新西北印染厂又开工生产了，该厂第一次印染成功的五星花哔叽，更受到了西北农民的欢迎。据中国花纱布公司西北区公司的统计，一九五二年比一九五○年的纺织品的销路增加了四倍多，今年可增加到六、七倍。有一个藏民叫道矶佳，在解放前除他自己外，家中其他四人都没裤子穿，光着脚走路；现在，由于西北纺织工业的不断发展和藏民生活的提高，去年他家就做了新衣服二十九件，还有两件料子未缝，并买了新靴子十五双。西北区的新建和扩建的纺织工厂，还正为西北人民生产着西北区从来没出产过的斜纹布和各种色彩鲜艳的花布。河北邯郸，也是有名的产棉地区，面临广大农村的国营邯郸第一棉纺织厂，它已生产出的数十万匹布供给了当地农民的需用。
    越来越多的规模更大的纺织工厂还在继续地建设。现在正在新建的棉纺织厂共有八个，其中国营的有北京第一棉纺织厂、石家庄第一棉纺织厂、国营西北第三棉纺织厂、郑州第一棉纺织厂；地方国营的有辽西棉纺织厂、湘潭棉纺织厂、江西棉纺织厂。此外，在云南正新建一座新式漂染工厂，重庆六一零厂附设的印染工厂也正积极建设中，在宁夏省建设的一座毛纺厂即将完工。另外还有若干丝织、针织等厂以及在哈尔滨附近建设的两个亚麻原料厂。与此同时，今年还有二十多个纺织工厂（包括公私合营和私营）正在进行扩建或改建。明年，在北京、石家庄、西安、郑州等地还有四个更大规模的国营棉纺织厂要进行施工。
    我国的纺织工业在国民经济很大的增长当中，正为满足人民生活日益增涨的需要而逐步发展。
