General Line Education is the Driving Force for Promoting Winter Production and Grain Sales
    ——The Effect of General Line Education in the Guo Yuancai Mutual Aid Team, Licheng County, Shandong Province
    Licheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

    The Guo Yuancai Mutual Aid Team in Tantou Township, Licheng County, Shandong Province, since the beginning of November, has been simultaneously carrying out winter agricultural and sideline production and conducting a year-end production summary and evaluation. Based on this summary and evaluation, the team members were educated on the Party's general line for the transition period. After this education, each household carefully calculated their accounts, which raised the ideological awareness of the team members. As a result, they sold all their surplus grain, totaling 7,321 jin, to the state. After repaying the bank loan of 2.2 million yuan, the remaining money was deposited in the bank, ready to order 5,000 jin of pig hair (rice field fertilizer), 2,000 jin of chemical fertilizer, and a rice threshing machine from the cooperative in the coming spring, in order to expand reproduction. After selling the grain, the whole team revised its winter agricultural and sideline production plan. They completed winter plowing in two days, turned over 1.2 mu (large mu) of rice fields, and bundled 720 straw sacks. Most team members also actively requested the establishment of an agricultural production cooperative, showing high enthusiasm for production.

    I. Combining Winter Agricultural and Sideline Production to Summarize and Evaluate This Year's Production

    The Guo Yuancai Mutual Aid Team has a total of 7.4 mu of arable land for winter cultivation and 25.6 mu of rice fields that can be turned over. The whole team has seven straw sack machines. Based on this situation, the team first mobilized male laborers to plow the land in winter and turn over the rice fields, while female laborers bundled straw sacks. After production during the day, the whole team summarized the year's production in the evenings, evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of mutual aid production over the past year. The evaluation results showed that many farmers in the team had increased their production compared to previous years. The team members unanimously agreed that the reasons for the increased production were: 1. Organization allowed for land processing and soil improvement, with an average of five more workdays spent per mu compared to last year. The most significant example within the team was member Li Chuanhui's large mu of rice field. After improving the soil this year, he harvested 2,000 jin of rice. If they had not organized, he would not have been able to improve the soil with his individual strength alone. 2. The government supported the team's production, providing loans for 2,000 jin of chemical fertilizer. During the summary and evaluation process, team members raised various opinions about the long-standing problems within the team, such as the lack of transparency in sideline business accounts and some team members partnering with merchants to do business, seeking only personal enrichment, which affected agricultural production. These problems were initially resolved through criticism and self-criticism.

    II. After Educating on the General Line for the Transition Period, Team Members Actively Requested the Establishment of Agricultural Production Cooperatives

    Based on the summary and evaluation of this year's production, the district and township cadres working in the team educated all team members on the Party's general line for the transition period. Using the examples of twenty households in the township who sold their land due to natural disasters over the past year and the example of team member Guo Yuanming selling his land due to living difficulties, the weaknesses of the small-scale peasant economy were analyzed, and the two roads in the countryside were compared. After the above education, most team members, especially poor peasants and new middle peasants, requested the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives. For example, Guo Yuankui's mother said, "I have been hoping for days like in the Soviet Union, but it's just a distant dream! We must quickly establish a cooperative!" Guo Fengde said, "Listening to the education on the general line is extremely satisfying, we must have a cooperative." Guo Yuanying, a demobilized soldier, said after studying the general line, "I wanted to join a cooperative when I returned from the military, and now I can finally wait for it." While the team members were preparing to establish an agricultural production cooperative, they also planned to convert one mu of dry land into rice fields, press alkali soil on two mu, and carry out agricultural capital construction.

    III. Team Members Actively Sell Grain and Carry Out Winter Production

    When studying the general line, all team members recalled and compared the past and present with concrete facts, which enabled them to have a clearer understanding of the two roads in the countryside. When talking about the People's Government using industrial products to help the team's production, female team member Li Junying said, "If the government hadn't provided loans for chemical fertilizer, Li Chuanhui's large mu of land would not have yielded 2,000 jin of rice, even with soil improvement." When comparing prices before and after liberation, team members said that prices were stable after liberation and farmers' lives were guaranteed. However, before liberation, price fluctuations caused great losses for farmers. The most prominent example was Guo Shilin, who sold 500 jin of millet before Jinan was liberated, intending to buy a cow. However, after keeping the money from selling the millet for two days, he couldn't even buy a pig, and only bought one jin of scallions, nine eggplants, and three jin of soybean oil. He said, "I was really ripped off!" When comparing the prices of goods in cooperatives and private merchants, everyone felt that various items in the cooperatives were cheaper than those of private merchants. They also complained about the suffering of private merchants raising prices and exploiting farmers. For example, in Baizi market, when the cooperative ran out of soybean oil, merchants raised the price of soybean oil from 5,200 yuan per jin to 6,400 yuan in less than three hours, and later even increased it to 7,200 yuan. After the above recollection and comparison, and after discussing the relationship between a bright future and farmers selling grain for national industrialization, the ideological awareness of the vast majority of team members improved. Guo Fengde said, "Merchants are so mischievous when the cooperative runs out of oil. Wouldn't people be forced to death if grain was hoarded by merchants? If the state cannot control grain, it will not only be unable to build industry, but it will also not be able to support our production. Would we be worthy of Chairman Mao and the People's Government if we don't sell our surplus grain to the state?" Guo Liurong said, "The walking plows, sprayers, and chemical fertilizers we use are all made by factories. If we don't supply the working class with grain, they won't be able to produce more new agricultural tools, and how will we move towards socialism and live a better life in the future?" Middle peasant Guo Xinlin also said, "I've turned around, national industrialization and our organization are the same thing!" After the team members understood these principles, the whole team sold all their surplus grain of 7,321 jin of rice to the state at once. After selling the grain, the team members' enthusiasm was even higher. In just two days, they completed the agricultural capital construction work of converting one mu of dry land into rice fields and pressing alkali on two mu of land; in five days, they bundled 308 more straw sacks, and planned to dismantle the walls of two old houses as fertilizer for wheat fields; the seven straw sack machines will strive to bundle 2,000 straw sacks each month, earning 2 million yuan, which will be deposited in the bank to purchase fertilizer and plough cattle next spring for expanding reproduction. The team also proposed:
  "Next year, we will produce more grain, sell more surplus grain to the state, support national construction, and actively build a socialist society." Currently, two-thirds of the households in the team are actively requesting the establishment of an agricultural production cooperative.

    总路线教育是推动冬季生产和卖粮的动力
    ——山东历城县郭元才互助组进行总路线教育的效果
    中共历城县委会
    山东省历城县滩头乡郭元才互助组，从十一月初起，就一面进行冬季农副业生产，一面进行一年生产的总结评比，并在总结评比的基础上，对组员进行了国家在过渡时期总路线的教育。经过这一教育以后，每户都算了细账，组员的思想觉悟因此提高，把余粮七千三百二十一斤全部卖给国家，卖粮的钱除还给银行二百二十万元的贷款外，余下的全部存入银行，准备明春向合作社定购五千斤猪毛（稻田肥料），二千斤化学肥料，一部打稻机等生产资料，以扩大再生产。卖粮后，全组又重新修订了冬季农副业生产计划，两天即完成了冬耕，翻稻田一·二亩（大亩），打草包七百二十个，多数组员并积极要求成立农业生产合作社，生产情绪很高。
    一、结合冬季农副业生产总结评比今年生产
    郭元才互助组冬季可耕地共七亩四分，可翻的稻田是二十五亩六分，全组共有草包机七架。该组根据这一情况，首先发动了男劳力下地冬耕和翻稻田，女劳力打草包。全组在白天生产以后，晚上就总结全年生产，评比一年来互助生产中的优缺点。评比结果显示，组里许多农民都比往年增产了。增产的原因，全体组员一致认为是：一、组织起来进行了土地加工、改良了土壤，每亩地平均比去年多用五个工。组内最显著的是组员李传辉的一大亩稻田，今年改良土壤以后，收了稻谷二千斤，如果不是组织起来，只凭他个人的力量是不能改良土壤的。二、政府对全组生产进行了扶持，只化学肥料就贷给了二千斤。在总结评比的过程中，组员对组内长期存在的副业账目不公开，有的组员同商人合伙做生意，只图个人发财，影响农业生产等问题纷纷提出意见，并以批评和自我批评的方法获得了初步解决。
    二、进行过渡时期总路线的教育后，组员纷纷要求成立农业生产合作社
    在总结评比今年生产的基础上，在该组工作的区乡干部，对全体组员进行了国家过渡时期总路线的教育。拿全乡一年来因受自然灾害出卖土地的二十户和组员郭元明因生活困难出卖土地的事例，分析了小农经济的弱点，对农村两条道路作了对比。经过以上的教育以后，多数组员尤其是贫农和新中农便要求成立农业生产合作社。如郭元奎的母亲说：“天天盼苏联一样的日子，可望着边啦！咱得快成立合作社呀！”郭风德说：“听了总路线的教育可痛快极了，非搞合作社不可。”郭元英是转业军人，学习了总路线以后说：“我转业回来就想参加合作社，这可等着啦。”全体组员一面酝酿成立农业生产合作社，同时又计划把一亩旱田改稻田，压碱地二亩，进行农业基本建设工作。
    三、组员积极卖粮，开展冬季生产
    学习总路线时，全体组员用具体事实对过去、现在作了回忆对比，使组员对农村中的两条道路，更加有了明确的认识。在谈到人民政府用工业品帮助该组生产时，女组员李俊英说：“不是政府贷给化学肥料，光凭改良土壤，李传辉的一大亩田也不能收到两千斤稻谷。”在对比解放前后的物价时，组员都说解放后物价稳定，农民生活有保障。但是在解放前，物价波动，可使农民吃亏大啦。最突出的是，郭士林在济南解放前曾卖了五百斤小米，打算买头牛，但把卖米的钱放了两天以后，连口猪也买不到了，只买了一斤葱、九个茄子、三斤豆油。他说：“真把我坑死啦！”在对比合作社和私商的商品价格时，大家都觉得合作社的各种物品都比私商便宜。他们并诉了私商抬高物价，剥削农民的苦。如坝子集上，合作社缺了豆油，不到三个小时，商人就把豆油价格从五千二百元一斤提高到六千四百元，后来竟涨到七千二百元。经过以上回忆对比，并把美好的将来和农民售粮对国家工业化的关系进行讨论以后，绝大多数组员的思想觉悟都提高了。郭风德说：“合作社缺了油，商人就这样捣鬼，如果粮食被商人囤积起来还不逼死人吗？国家掌握不了粮食，不但不能建设工业，对咱们的生产也不能扶持了，咱有余粮不卖给国家，对得起毛主席和人民政府吗？”郭六荣说：“咱使的步犁、喷雾器和化学肥料都是工厂造的，咱不供给工人老大哥粮食，他们就不能生产更多的新式农具，将来咱怎样走向社会主义过更好的生活。”中农郭新林也说：“我转过向来啦，国家工业化和咱组织起来是一回事啦！”在组员懂得这些道理以后，全组就把余粮七千三百二十一斤稻谷一次卖给了国家。卖粮后，组员们的情绪更加高涨起来，只两天时间就完成了一亩旱地改稻田和二亩地压碱的农田基本建设工作；五天的时间又打出草包三百零八个，并计划拆两间旧屋墙做为麦田肥料；七架草包机每月争取打二千个草包，可赚二百万元，存入银行，待明春购买肥料和耕牛，以便扩大再生产。组里并提出了：
  “明年要多打粮食，要把更多的余粮卖给国家，支援国家建设，积极建设社会主义社会。”现该组已有三分之二的户积极要求成立农业生产合作社。
