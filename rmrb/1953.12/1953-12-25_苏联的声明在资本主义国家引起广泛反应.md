Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 23rd: According to TASS, the Soviet government's statement on Eisenhower's speech has elicited a wide range of reactions in the United States.

The first reaction to the Soviet reply was a statement by US State Department spokesman, Mr. Suydam. He avoided discussing the substance of the Soviet statement, and instead expressed an irrelevant opinion on the need to ratify the "European Defense Community" treaty. Agence France-Presse's Washington correspondent pointed out that the intention of the American ruling group is to prevent the prospect of negotiations from delaying or preventing the ratification of the "European Army" treaty.

On December 21st, US Secretary of State Dulles issued a statement saying: "The Soviet Union, in its reply, criticized the President's proposal, saying that it does not eliminate the threat of atomic weapons. The Soviet Union, in its reply, still adheres to its previous position." Dulles went on to say, "The Soviet Union clearly does not understand the spirit of the President's proposal." Dulles' statement obviously distorted the substance of the Soviet government's statement.

Congressmen and newspaper commentators echoed the State Department's tune. Like American official representatives, they avoided talking about the substance of the Soviet proposal, namely that all countries undertake a sacred and unconditional obligation not to use atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction. Some congressmen (especially Senator Ferguson, chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee) insisted that the United States should continue to expand its armaments. Other legislators said they held a "very skeptical" attitude towards negotiating with the Soviet Union on the atomic issue. Representative Short, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, even put forward a requirement as a condition: before concentrating atomic resources or even exchanging intelligence with the Soviet Union, "a group of allied inspectors should be sent to Russia to investigate whether the Russians are prepared to resolutely implement the guarantees." The "New York Herald Tribune" revealed the reasons for the above reactions, saying: "Some people said that when this plan (i.e., Eisenhower's plan) was proposed, it was expected that the Soviet Union would refuse to participate."

According to a UPI report, Democratic Senator Kefauver of Tennessee admitted that the United States should proceed on the basis that the Soviet government made a statement on Eisenhower's speech at the United Nations based on "sincere motives," and then explain the parts of the Soviet government's statement that considered Eisenhower's speech unclear.

Robert, the diplomatic commentator of the "Washington Post," said that State Department officials admitted that the Soviet government's statement "will obviously receive a broad reaction from the entire world dedicated to finding a way out of the atomic arms race."

Xinhua News Agency, December 24th: The Soviet government's statement on Eisenhower's speech on atomic weapons has attracted widespread attention in Western European countries.

According to a TASS report, Agence France-Presse reported that Paris expressed great satisfaction with the Soviet government's statement agreeing to negotiate with the United States on the issue of atomic energy; it is believed that the issue has touched on the first step that all countries (including France) hope for, namely negotiations on disarmament. All newspapers in Paris paid close attention to the Soviet government's statement. "L'Humanité" specifically mentioned that the Soviet government's statement provides a good opportunity to reach an agreement leading to this issue. "L'Humanité" wrote: "If the US government and President Eisenhower are sincerely talking about peace and regretting that many countries have embarked on the disastrous path of arms expansion, then diplomatic negotiations on this issue are an excellent opportunity for them to demonstrate this sincerity...". "Franc-Tireur" attempted to explain that it seemed the Soviet government was putting forward empty rhetoric in its statement. Other bourgeois newspapers also repeated this unfounded arbitrariness. But at the same time, the newspapers also emphasized that the Soviet statement, which affirmed the possibility of resolving the atomic issue, was very important. "L'Aurore" wrote: "What is more important is that the two major powers have finally begun negotiations for the specific purpose of preventing atomic danger." "Le Monde" wrote: "It is necessary to hope that this negotiation will begin as soon as possible...".

A British Foreign Office spokesman said at a press conference that the Soviet government's statement was merely "reiterating the Soviet Union's views on the atomic energy issue and expressing its willingness to discuss Eisenhower's proposals." However, he also said, "Expressing willingness to discuss these proposals is undoubtedly a gratifying thing." Many British bourgeois newspapers avoided talking about the essence of the Soviet statement's proposals, distorting its true meaning. The "Manchester Guardian" babbled about how the Soviet government's statement led to "endless old arguments." The "Daily Express" called the Soviet statement "a glimmer of hope in the world." The newspaper asked: "Isn't it time to restore Churchill's proposal for a secret meeting of heads of state? ... It is said that Churchill's peace plan was rejected at the Bermuda conference. The Russian statement proves that it is absolutely necessary to re-propose this plan." The "Daily Herald" editorial wrote: "This is not a dead end, but a real glimmer of hope. Soviet leaders are not just agreeing to negotiate. Their entire reply is sensible."

Italian newspapers published summaries of the Soviet government's statement in prominent positions. "La Nazione" wrote: The Soviet government's statement "is undoubtedly a matter of great significance, opening up a new perspective in international relations... In order for new consultations between the United States and the Soviet Union to be more effective and help eliminate the threat of atomic bombs, it is necessary to clarify whether Eisenhower is prepared to do so: on the one hand, to conduct consultations according to his new plan, and on the other hand, the consultations should be able to freely reach an agreement that takes into account the opinions of others."

    苏联的声明在资本主义国家引起广泛反应
      【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十三日讯：苏联政府就艾森豪威尔演说所发表的声明，在美国引起了广泛的反应。
    对苏联的答复的第一个反应是美国国务院发言人苏丹姆的谈话。他对苏联声明的实质避开不谈，却发表了与本题无关的、关于必须批准“欧洲防务集团”条约的意见。法新社驻华盛顿记者指出，美国统治集团的意图是，不让谈判的前景延缓或阻止批准“欧洲军”条约。
    就在十二月二十一日这一天，美国国务卿杜勒斯发表了声明。他说：“苏联在答复中批评了总统的建议，说它没有消除原子武器的威胁。苏联在答复中仍然坚持着以前的立场。”杜勒斯接着说：“苏联显然没有领会总统建议的精神。”杜勒斯这种说法显然歪曲了苏联政府声明的实质。
    国会议员和报纸评论员们纷纷顺着国务院的腔调表示意见。他们和美国官方代表一样绝口不谈苏联建议的实质，即：各国承担起神圣的、无条件的义务，不再使用原子武器、氢武器以及其他大规模毁灭性武器。一些国会议员（特别是参议院共和党政策委员会主席福格逊）坚持美国应继续扩充军备。另一些议员说，他们对于跟苏联就原子问题进行谈判一事抱着“非常怀疑”的态度。众议院军事委员会主席肖特甚至提出这样一个要求作为条件：在集中原子资源或甚至于在和苏联交换情报以前，“应派一批盟国监察员到俄国去调查，看看俄国人是不是准备坚决执行保证”。“纽约先驱论坛报”透露了上述反应的原因说：“有人说，当初提出这个计划（即艾森豪威尔的计划）时，预计苏联会拒绝参加。”
    据合众社消息，民主党田纳西州参议员克弗维尔承认，美国应当根据这样一种观念出发，即认为苏联政府是根据“真诚的动机”来就艾森豪威尔在联合国中的演说发表声明的，然后对苏联政府声明中认为艾森豪威尔演说不清楚的部分加以解释。
  “华盛顿邮报”的外交评论员罗伯茨称，国务院官员承认，苏联政府的声明“显然会获得致力于寻找原子军备竞赛出路的整个世界的广泛的反应”。
    【新华社二十四日讯】苏联政府就艾森豪威尔关于原子武器的演说所发表的声明，在西欧国家引起广泛的注意。
    据塔斯社讯：法新社报道，巴黎对苏联政府同意与美国就原子能问题进行谈判的声明表示十分满意；大家认为，问题已触及各国（包括法国在内）所希望的、就裁军问题进行谈判的第一步。巴黎所有的报纸都很注意苏联政府的声明。“人道报”特别提到，苏联政府的声明为导致这一问题的协议提供了一个很好的机会。“人道报”写道：“如果美国政府和艾森豪威尔总统是在诚意地谈着和平并对许多国家走上了扩军的灭亡道路表示惋惜，那末就这一问题进行的外交谈判就是让他们表白这种诚意的绝好的机会……”。“义勇军报”企图说明，似乎苏联政府在声明中提出的是空论。其他资产阶级报纸也重复这套毫无根据的武断。但各报同时也着重指出，肯定了解决原子问题的可能性的苏联声明是十分重要的。“震旦报”写道：“更重要的是，两个世界大国为了防止原子危险这一具体目的，终于开始谈判。”“世界报”写道：“希望这种谈判尽可能快地开始，这是必要的……。”
    英国外交部发言人在记者招待会上说，苏联政府的声明只不过是“重申苏联对原子能问题的观点和表示准备讨论艾森豪威尔的建议”。不过，他又说，“表示准备讨论这些建议，无疑是一件令人欢欣的事”。英国许多资产阶级报纸避而不谈苏联声明中的建议的本质，歪曲它的真义。“曼彻斯特卫报”胡诌什么苏联政府的声明导致“无穷无尽的老争论”。“每日快报”称苏联的声明是“在全世界出现的一线希望”。该报问道：“现在岂不是恢复邱吉尔提出的由各国元首举行秘密会谈的建议的时候了么？……据说，在百慕大会议上，邱吉尔的和平计划遭到拒绝。俄国的声明证明十分有必要重新提出这个计划”。“每日先驱报”社论写道：“现在不是绝境，而是真正的一线希望。苏联领导人不仅仅是同意谈判。他们整个的答复是明智的。”
    意大利报纸以显著地位刊载了苏联政府的声明的摘要。“国家报”写道：苏联政府的声明“无疑是一件具有重大意义的事情，它在国际关系方面打开一个新的远景……为了使美国和苏联进行新的商谈能够更有成效并有助于消除原子弹的威胁，就必须弄清楚，艾森豪威尔是否准备这么做：一方面根据他的新计划来进行商谈，另一方面商谈要能自由达成协议，这一协议要考虑到别人的意见。”
