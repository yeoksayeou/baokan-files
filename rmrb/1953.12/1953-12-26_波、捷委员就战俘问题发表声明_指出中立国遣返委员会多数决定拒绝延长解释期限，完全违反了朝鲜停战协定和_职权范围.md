Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 25th: The Czechoslovak and Polish Commissioners of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, regarding the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's majority decision on December 23, 1953, to reject the request from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Headquarters to continue the explanation work to the North Korean and Chinese prisoners of war under the supervision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, made the following statement to representatives of the Xinhua News Agency and the Korean Central News Agency:

According to the provisions of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," each party to which the prisoners of war belonged has the right to conduct explanation work within a period of ninety days. Due to the criminal activities of the Syngman Rhee special agents and Chiang Kai-shek special agents planted in the POW camp in Dongjang-ri by the former detaining party—namely, the United Nations Command—the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Headquarters only conducted ten days of explanation work. According to the provisions of the "Terms of Reference," the explanation work should have started immediately after the prisoners of war were transferred to the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission—that is, on September 25, 1953. However, due to the delay caused by the United Nations Command's dilatory behavior in constructing the explanation facilities, the explanation work could not begin until October 15, 1953. When the United Nations Command was finally forced to do so, it used other methods through special agents to sabotage the explanation work. Therefore, since October 15, 1953, the explanation work has been interrupted several times, sometimes for weeks. Due to this arbitrary interruption aimed at completely sabotaging the explanation work, only a small portion of the ninety days was spent on explanation work. All these facts are well known to the world and therefore need not be repeated. More and more evidence is collected every day illustrating the various methods by which special agents maintained their reign of terror and violence in the POW camps. Even serious crimes such as brutal murder have been frighteningly and thoroughly exposed. There is no doubt that more evidence will be obtained in the future.

Not only the entire spirit of the "Terms of Reference," but also its clear provisions stipulate that both parties should be given the right to conduct explanations during the entire ninety-day period and entrust the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission with the inescapable responsibility of ensuring that both parties can truly exercise this basic right.

Under these circumstances, the Czechoslovak and Polish Commissioners of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission have firmly demanded that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission immediately take the necessary measures to continue the explanation work so that the entire ninety-day explanation period agreed upon by both parties can be supplemented. The majority decision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has, on the one hand, deprived the North Korean and Chinese sides of their right to explanation and the prisoners of war of the opportunity to listen to explanations and request repatriation, and on the other hand, seriously violated the "Terms of Reference" and the Korean Armistice Agreement.

The Czechoslovak and Polish delegations strongly oppose this violation of international agreements, and they will never agree to such an arbitrary interpretation: as if the explanation work to the prisoners of war in this case has been completed in accordance with the basic provisions of the Armistice Agreement.

    波、捷委员就战俘问题发表声明
    指出中立国遣返委员会多数决定拒绝延长解释期限，完全违反了朝鲜停战协定和“职权范围”
    【新华社开城二十五日电】中立国遣返委员会捷克斯洛伐克委员和波兰委员，就中立国遣返委员会在一九五三年十二月二十三日以多数决定拒绝朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军司令部所提出的关于继续对中立国遣返委员会看管下的朝中被俘人员进行解释工作的要求一事，向新华社和朝鲜中央通讯社的代表发表如下声明：
    根据“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”规定，战俘所属的各方有权在九十天期间内进行解释工作。由于前拘留一方——即联合国军司令部——在东场里战俘营里安插的李承晚特务和蒋介石特务进行的罪恶活动，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军司令部只进行了十天的解释工作。根据“职权范围”的规定，解释工作应当在战俘移交中立国遣返委员会看管后——即一九五三年九月二十五日——立即开始。但是，由于联合国军司令部对修建解释设备的怠工行为而引起的拖延，解释工作到一九五三年十月十五日才能进行。当联合国军司令部最后被迫这样做的时候，它就通过特务使用了破坏解释工作的其他方法。因此，自一九五三年十月十五日起，解释工作曾数度中断，有时中断达数星期之久。由于这种旨在完全破坏解释工作的专横的中断，在九十天中只有一小部分时日进行了解释工作。所有这些事实已为世界所共知，因此无须加以赘述。每一天都搜集到越来越多的说明特务在战俘营中维持其恐怖与暴力统治的各种方法的证据。甚至像残酷谋杀这种严重罪行，也可怕地详尽地被揭露出来了。毫无疑问，将来一定会得到更多的证据。
    不但是“职权范围”的整个精神，而且是它的明白条文都规定应给予双方在整个九十天的期间进行解释的权利，并赋予中立国遣返委员会以无可规避的保证双方能真正行使这个基本权利的职责。
    中立国遣返委员会的捷克斯洛伐克和波兰委员在这种情况下，曾坚决要求中立国遣返委员会立即采取必要的措施使解释工作继续进行，以便双方所明白同意的全部九十天解释期间能够予以补足。中立国遣返委员会的多数决定，已经在一方面剥夺了朝中方面的解释权利和战俘听取解释与要求遣返的机会，在另一方面，等于严重地违反了“职权范围”和朝鲜停战协定。
    捷克斯洛伐克和波兰代表团强烈地反对这种违反国际协定的行为，它们将永不同意这样一种武断的解释：好像在这种情况下对战俘的解释工作是依照停战协定的基本规定而完成的。
                一九五三年十二月二十五日
