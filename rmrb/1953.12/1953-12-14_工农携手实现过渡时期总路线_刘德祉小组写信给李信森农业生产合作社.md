    Workers and Peasants Join Hands to Realize the General Line for the Transition Period
    Liu Dezhi Group Writes to Li Xinsen Agricultural Production Cooperative
    The Liu Dezhi group of the No. 2 branch of the state-owned Qingdao Industry Flour Mill comprehensively overfulfilled its production increase and economization plan in November. Recently, they wrote a letter to all members of the Li Xinsen Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs, expressing their willingness to join hands with them to implement the general line. The following is the letter written by the workers of the Liu Dezhi group:
    To all members of the Li Xinsen Agricultural Production Cooperative:
    We are the Liu Dezhi group of the No. 2 branch of the state-owned Qingdao Industry Flour Mill. We are working day and night to grind the wheat produced by our peasant brothers into a large amount of flour to support national construction and meet the needs of the people's lives.
    In the November production increase and economization competition, our group ground more than 4.6 million catties of flour, the quality fully met the standards, and the cost was greatly reduced. There were no accidents of responsibility throughout the month, and the group's production increase and economization plan was comprehensively overfulfilled.
    These days, after hearing the Party's report on the general line and general task during the transition period, we further realized that now is the transition period to strive for a gradual transition to socialism. By realizing the general line and general task of the transition period, our country can enter socialism, and like the Soviet Union, everyone can live a happy and fulfilling life. We all feel even brighter in our hearts. Looking back at the great achievements of our country in all aspects over the past four years, we believe that what Chairman Mao said is absolutely true, and our ideals are being realized step by step. In the future, we will strive according to the Party's general line and general task during the transition period, and the country's socialist industrialization will definitely be realized quickly. Now our whole group is determined to add another effort, strive to comprehensively complete the production increase and economization plan for the last month of the first year of the first five-year plan, and put forward four guarantees: First, in terms of output, strive to complete the plan on a daily basis, and increase by 5% more than the plan for the whole month. Second, in terms of quality, ensure no sand flour, strictly follow operating procedures, check samples on time, and pick out sand. Third, in terms of saving, do not waste a grain of wheat, a bit of flour, or a drop of oil, and strive to reduce oil consumption by 25% compared with the plan, and save 0.2% of wheat. Fourth, strive to avoid machine accidents, and ensure no accidents of responsibility and large and small work-related injuries.
    We hope that you will also further actively respond to the call of the Party and the government, implement the country's general line and general task during the transition period, and lead the broad masses of peasant brothers to produce more grain, sell the surplus grain to the state, and support national construction. We guarantee to start the machines day and night and grind out good flour. Our worker-peasant brothers will join hands to support national construction, make our worker-peasant alliance more consolidated, and jointly ensure the building of our great socialist country!
                          With best regards,
               The Liu Dezhi Group, No. 2 Branch,
                  State-owned Qingdao Industry Flour Mill
                  All Workers

    工农携手实现过渡时期总路线
    刘德祉小组写信给李信森农业生产合作社
    国营青岛实业面粉厂第二分厂刘德祉小组，十一月份全面超额完成了增产节约计划。最近写信给郊区李信森农业生产合作社全体社员，表示愿和他们携起手来，贯彻总路线。下面就是刘德祉小组工人写的信：李信森农业生产合作社全体社员同志们：
    我们是国营青岛实业面粉厂第二分厂刘德祉小组，我们正在日夜不断地把农民弟兄生产出来的小麦，磨制出大量的面粉支援国家建设，供应广大人民的生活需要。
    十一月份增产节约竞赛中，我们小组磨制了四百六十多万斤面粉，质量完全符合标准，成本也大大地降低了，全月没发生责任事故，全面超额完成了小组增产节约计划。
    这几天，我们听到党在过渡时期总路线总任务的报告后，进一步知道了现在是为逐步过渡到社会主义而奋斗的过渡时期。实现了过渡时期的总路线总任务，我们的国家就可以进入社会主义，和苏联那样，大家过着幸福美满的生活。我们心里都更加亮堂了。再看看过去这四年多，我们国家在各方面的伟大成就，我们相信毛主席说的话都是千真万确的，我们的理想已经在一步一步地实现了，今后照着党在过渡时期的总路线总任务去奋斗，国家的社会主义工业化一定能很快实现。现在我们全组决心再加上一把劲，争取全面完成第一个五年计划头一年的最后一个月增产节约计划，并提出了四项保证：一、产量方面，争取按日完成计划，并且全月要比计划多增加百分之五。二、质量方面，保证不出砂粉，严格照操作规程办事，按时对样子，拣砂子。三、节约方面，不浪费一粒麦子、一点面、一滴油，争取用油比计划减少百分之二十五，节约小麦百分之零点二。四、争取不发生机器事故，保证不发生责任事故和大小工伤事故。
    我们希望你们也进一步积极响应党和政府的号召，贯彻国家在过渡时期的总路线总任务，带动广大农民弟兄，多生产粮食，把余粮卖给国家，支援国家建设。我们保证日夜开动机器，磨出好面。咱工农弟兄共同携手支援国家建设，使我们的工农联盟更加巩固，共同保证建成我们的伟大的社会主义国家！
                          此致敬礼
               国营青岛实业面粉厂第二分厂
