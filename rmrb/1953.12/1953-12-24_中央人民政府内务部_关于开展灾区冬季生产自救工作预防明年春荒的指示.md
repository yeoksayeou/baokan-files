    I. This year, various disaster-stricken areas, under the unified leadership of party and government organs at all levels, have actively carried out rescue efforts and have recovered part of the agricultural harvest. However, how to ensure that the people in disaster areas can safely survive the winter and reduce the spring famine next year (some impoverished mountainous and pastoral areas, although not affected by the disaster, may also experience spring famine) remains a major issue. Governments at all levels in disaster areas should attach even greater importance than in previous years and take the necessary measures to do a good job in production and disaster relief.
    Currently, the countryside is vigorously promoting the general line of the transition period to the peasants. Carrying out such systematic political propaganda and education in disaster areas is undoubtedly a powerful impetus to carrying out production for self-relief. This is because, according to the path pointed out by the general line, organizing the peasants and pooling their efforts can maximize the power to overcome famine. At the same time, it must be recognized that the masses in disaster areas, especially severely affected areas, still face many difficulties in production and life. All work in disaster areas should revolve around production and disaster relief. When publicizing the general line to the peasants, it is necessary to first solve the current difficulties of the disaster victims, with everyone brainstorming ideas and the government providing support. Only in this way can the propaganda of the general line be accepted by the disaster victims.
    II. At present, sideline production has been developed in most disaster areas and has achieved great results. This lays a favorable foundation for preventing the spring famine next year. However, in carrying out this work, attention must also be paid to: (1) Developing a variety of sideline production activities according to different local conditions. Currently, many local leaders are focusing on several large-scale and major sideline businesses to make overall plans, actively exploring sales channels through various contacts. This is very necessary and correct. However, while focusing on large-scale and major sideline businesses, it is also necessary to mobilize the masses and develop a variety of small-scale sideline production activities based on local characteristics. This type of small-scale sideline production is often not noticed by leaders, but it can solve some of the difficulties for disaster victims. For example, in mountainous areas, firewood chopping, medicinal herb digging, and hunting; in plains areas, small handicrafts and temporary transportation; and in water areas, fishing and net weaving, etc. This type of sideline production is easy to carry out and does not require large amounts of capital. As long as organizational leadership is strengthened, it can be fully developed. (2) Pay attention to overcoming the imbalance in the development of sideline production in various regions. Some disaster areas began mobilizing disaster victims to engage in sideline production after the autumn cultivation and sowing, and are now entering a stage of full-scale development. However, some disaster areas only issued instructions and called for action as usual, lacking specific guidance. Others, after a long period of drainage and autumn sowing, breathed a sigh of relief and failed to immediately grasp sideline production. Still others believe that sideline production does not generate much income and does not require leading the masses, relying solely on government relief. These phenomena all show that the current development of sideline production is still unbalanced. Therefore, areas that have already developed should consolidate their achievements and continue to vigorously develop under the condition of having sales channels. At the same time, seize the existing production and consider and prepare for the next step of production, so as to change the production content at any time when the seasons change. Areas that have not developed well or have not developed should actively organize and promote from the leadership level, conduct frequent inspections, and quickly reverse the situation. Actively help solve several major problems in sideline production, such as raw materials, capital, technology, and sales channels. Some incorrect understandings of sideline production that exist among cadres and the masses should also be criticized and corrected in a timely manner. (3) In carrying out production for self-relief, we should rely on and develop rural mutual aid and cooperative organizations to give play to the power of the masses to help each other overcome famine. It must be recognized that the individual economy of farmers has a weak ability to resist disasters, and difficulties in sideline production such as capital, raw materials, sales channels, and technology can only be properly resolved by relying on this organized force. In areas where conditions permit, the combination of production and marketing contracts should be vigorously promoted, which will greatly help overcome the difficulties of sideline production for disaster victims and avoid blind production. In recent years, cadres and the masses in various disaster-stricken areas have accumulated rich experience in organizing production for self-relief. In addition, this year, various regions generally started early and acted quickly, and the full development of material exchanges between urban and rural areas means that general products can find sales channels. As long as the leadership attaches importance to it and deeply organizes and mobilizes the masses, sideline production can be done well.
    III. Continue to advocate thrift. Since the autumn harvest, many disaster areas have educated disaster victims to pay attention to thrift, not only saving food, but also saving sideline profits in winter, which has increased the power to overcome famine. At present, we should continue to vigorously advocate thrift. After the beginning of spring next year, we should actively organize the masses to plant more early-maturing crops according to local conditions. This is not only beneficial to overcoming the spring famine, but also saves food. Waste should also be prevented in the distribution of relief grain and funds, but necessary relief should be given to households in difficulty who are unable to carry out production for self-relief or who are unable to maintain their livelihoods even after production.
    IV. The civil affairs departments of people's governments at all levels in disaster-stricken areas should give play to the initiative of disaster relief work and do the following work well: First, it is necessary to clearly grasp the changes in the disaster situation and the dynamics of sideline production. This requires the establishment of a bottom-up reporting system, strengthening contact with relevant departments at the same level; what is even more important is to strengthen inspection, promptly report the information obtained and the problems discovered to the party and government leaders to seek rapid solutions; and to disseminate and introduce successful experiences and the creations of the masses at any time. Second, pay attention to encouraging the production enthusiasm of disaster victims through people's congresses or disaster victim representative meetings, and help disaster victims make plans so that sideline production and spring plowing next year can be carried out under leadership. Third, according to the verification of the disaster situation after autumn, the relief grain and funds retained by various levels this year should be cleared up, and the budget for next year should be quickly and properly distributed so that it can be centrally distributed to disaster households in need at the appropriate time to solve their food difficulties and support their sideline production.

### 中央人民政府内务部  关于开展灾区冬季生产自救工作预防明年春荒的指示

    关于开展灾区冬季生产自救工作预防明年春荒的指示
    一、今年遭灾各地，在各级党政机关统一领导下，积极抢救，虽已挽回一部分农业收成，但如何使灾民安全过冬并缩小明年春荒（某些贫瘠山区、牧区虽未遭灾，亦可能发生春荒），仍是一个重大问题。灾区的各级政府应比往年更加重视，并采取必要的措施把生产救灾的工作做好。
    目前，农村正在大张旗鼓地向农民宣传过渡时期的总路线，在灾区进行这种有系统的政治宣传教育，对开展生产自救工作，无疑是一个有力的推动。因为，按照总路线所指出的道路，使农民组织起来，群策群力，能够更大地发挥渡荒力量。但同时，要认识到灾区尤其重灾区群众在生产上和生活上都存在不少困难，灾区一切工作都应围绕生产救灾工作进行。在向农民宣传总路线时，必须首先解决灾民的当前困难，大家想办法，政府给以支持，这样总路线的宣传才能为灾民所接受。
    二、目前大部灾区副业生产已经得到开展并获得很大成绩。这就给预防明年春荒工作打下有利基础。但在进行这一工作中还须注意：（一）要根据各地不同情况开展多种多样的副业生产。当前不少地区领导上抓住几种大宗的、主要的副业做出通盘打算，通过四面八方联系，积极开拓销路，这是十分必要，也是正确的。但抓住大宗的、主要的，同时也须重视发动群众，依据当地特点开展多种多样的小型副业生产。这种小型的副业生产，往往不被领导注意，但它能给灾民解决部分困难。如山区的砍柴、挖药材、打猎，平原地区的小手工业、临时运输，水区的捕鱼、织网等等。这类副业生产容易搞，又不用大量资金，只要加强组织领导，就能充分开展起来。（二）注意克服各地在开展副业生产工作上的不平衡现象。有的灾区在秋耕秋种后，就发动灾民进行副业生产，目前正进入全面开展阶段；但有的灾区仅仅发出指示，照例号召，缺乏具体指导；也有的经过长时间的排水秋种以后，松了一口气，不能紧跟着抓紧副业生产；还有的认为副业生产收益不大，不须领导群众进行，单纯依靠政府救济。这些现象都说明目前副业生产开展还不平衡。因此，已经开展起来的地区，要巩固成果，在有销路的条件下，继续大力开展。同时，抓住现有的生产，并要考虑与准备下一步的生产，以便将来季节变换随时改变生产内容。开展不大好或未开展的地区，要从领导上积极组织推动，勤加检查，迅速扭转过来。对副业生产中原料、资金、技术、销路等几个主要问题，要主动帮助解决。在干部、群众中存在的一些对副业生产不正确的认识，也要及时加以批判纠正。（三）在进行生产自救工作中，应依靠并发展农村互助合作组织，发挥群众互助渡荒力量。要认识农民的个体经济抗灾力量薄弱，开展副业生产中资金、原料、销路、技术等困难，只有靠这种组织起来的力量，才能妥善得到解决。在有条件的地区，应该大力推行生产和供销的结合合同，这对克服灾民副业生产的困难和避免生产盲目性有极大作用。几年来各有灾地区的干部与群众对组织生产自救工作都有丰富经验，加以今年各地一般着手早、行动快，以及城乡物资交流的充分发展，一般产品都能找到销路，只要领导重视并深入组织发动群众，副业生产是能够搞好的。
    三、继续提倡节约。许多灾区，自秋收以来，就教育灾民注意节约，不仅节约粮食，而且在冬季还节约副业盈利，增加了渡荒力量。目前应继续大力提倡节约，明年开春后应根据各地情况，积极组织群众多种早熟作物。这样非但对渡过春荒有利而且还能节省粮食。在发放救济粮款中也要防止浪费，但对无法进行生产自救或虽经生产仍不能维持生活的困难户应给予必要的救济。
    四、有灾地区的各级人民政府民政部门，要发挥救灾工作的主动性，做好以下工作：第一、要清楚地掌握灾情的变化和副业生产的动态，这就需要建立自下而上的报告制度，加强和同级有关部门的联系；更要紧的是加强检查，及时地把得到的情况和发现的问题，向党政领导反映，求得迅速解决；把成功的经验和群众的创造，随时传播介绍。第二、注意通过人民代表会或灾民代表会，鼓舞灾民的生产积极性，帮助灾民订计划，使副业生产及明年春耕能有领导地进行。第三、根据秋后灾情的核实，把今年度各级保留的救济粮款清理一下，把明年的预算迅速妥善分配下去，以便在适当的时候，集中发放给必须救济的灾户，以解决其口粮困难与支持其副业生产。
