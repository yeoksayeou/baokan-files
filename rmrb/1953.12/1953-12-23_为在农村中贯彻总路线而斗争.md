    Striving to Implement the General Line in Rural Areas
    Shi Xin
    As long as the Party and the state's general line during the transition period is grasped by the broad masses of rural cadres and peasants, it will become a great material force, promoting the country's socialist transformation of agriculture and the smooth progress of the current rural grain procurement, agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation, and winter production work. Currently, many newspapers are making great efforts to implement the general line in rural areas. Nanjing Xinhua Daily and Hubei Daily are examples of this.
    To implement the general line in rural areas, it is necessary to educate peasants to understand why they should take the socialist road. When conducting this education, it is necessary to adopt methods that are easily understood and accepted by the peasant masses. "Because the masses, especially the peasant masses, always understand problems from things they have seen and experienced personally, rather than from our general propaganda and slogans." (Liu Shaoqi: "On the Party") This requires our newspapers to be good at linking the general line with the immediate interests and practical experiences of the peasants. Nanjing Xinhua Daily and Hubei Daily demonstrated these characteristics in their promotion of the general line. Nanjing Xinhua Daily, in conjunction with the large-scale promotion of the general line in Jiangsu Province, used the rising production and living conditions of peasants in various parts of Jiangsu since liberation to meticulously calculate accounts and find the reasons, educating peasants to understand the correctness of the general line from their own experiences and to recognize the importance of national socialist industrialization; it also widely exposed the backwardness and fragility of the small-peasant economy with actual examples to educate peasants about the necessity of implementing the socialist transformation of agriculture; and by specifically introducing the agricultural production and peasant life in the Soviet Union, as well as the increased grain production and income of many mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives in the local area, it educated peasants to recognize the bright prospects of socialism and the superiority of organizing. For example, "Helping Peasants Calculate Accounts," published on November 30, used the painful experiences of peasants in Songjiang County before liberation and the large number of cases where the small-peasant economy was still unable to withstand storms and resist the exploitation of speculators and usurers after the land reform, as well as the stark contrast between the production situation of individual peasants and those participating in mutual aid and cooperation, to vividly illustrate that if peasants want to fundamentally get rid of poverty and seek greater development in production, they can only take the road of organizing together for common prosperity, that is, taking the road of socialism. Hubei Daily also, in conjunction with current tasks, specifically analyzed the current situation in rural areas, pointing out that the small-peasant economy standing at a "crossroads" after the land reform is developing along two different roads. The newspaper used concrete facts to educate peasants to recognize the dangers of taking the old capitalist road, pointing out that taking the socialist road is the only correct and bright road that benefits both the country and the peasants.
    The process of implementing the general line in rural areas is a process of struggling against the spontaneous capitalist tendencies of the peasants, and a process of struggling against the capitalist road in rural areas. Therefore, our newspapers must use the method of mass self-education to educate peasants to recognize the dangers of this spontaneous trend, and inspire them to consciously struggle against this trend, so as to draw a clear line between the capitalist road and the socialist road. In this regard, it is very important to educate rural cadres, especially Party member cadres, to recognize the harm of capitalist ideology. Because "our revolution relies on cadres," "the Party relies on these people to connect with Party members and the masses" ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Beijing Second Edition, pp. 268, 267); making the cadres' thinking clear is the primary key to implementing the general line in rural areas. Nanjing Xinhua Daily, especially Hubei Daily, attached importance to this link in the propaganda of the general line. For example, Hubei Daily, on November 1, while introducing the correct development of sideline production by the Xuyongxiang mutual aid group in Luzhou Township, Echeng County, and the signing of sales contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives, also criticized the mistake of twenty-five mutual aid groups in Dingjiazhai Township, Macheng County, for jointly opening businesses in the name of "mutual aid sideline occupations" to engage in speculative business, and the mistake of the Xudingxue agricultural production cooperative in Xishui County for selling bamboo and wood and engaging in commerce; on November 20, while introducing the correct handling of surplus grain by the Xionghuashu mutual aid group in Zhushi Township, Wuchang County, and selling the grain to the state to expand reproduction, it also criticized the mistake of Guo Yunzhou, the village head of Guojiagang Village, Huayuan Township, Xinzhou County, and others, for using the name of the mutual aid group to engage in large-scale speculative business with surplus grain and surplus capital. This specifically pointed out to rural cadres and peasant masses what should be done and what should not be done. Hubei Daily also opened a special column of "Advancing on the Socialist Road, Never Taking the Capitalist Road," publishing self-criticisms of their own capitalist thoughts and behaviors by township cadres and Communist Party members in various regions after studying the general line. The article "I Realized the Mistake of Taking the Capitalist Road" written by Zheng Xinming, the township head of Tiancheng Township, Dangyang County, published on December 6, explained that Zheng Xinming, a Communist Party member from a poor peasant background, had reaped a bumper harvest year after year after the land reform, and consequently improved his life, and even "forgot the pain once the wound healed." He accepted the influence of rich peasant thought and embarked on the capitalist road of doing business and buying green seedlings. From then on, Zheng Xinming no longer wanted to be a cadre, nor did he want to engage in mutual aid and cooperation, but was focused on getting rich personally. When he participated in the enlarged cadre meeting in Dangyang County this time, and studied the general line, and associated this with the situation that some peasants in his township had been exploited by usurers to the point of having no grain to eat and other class differentiation, and then associated this with the pain he had personally suffered from the oppression of landlords and usurers in the past, he suddenly realized that "the Communist Party led us to turn over, and I also joined the Party, and should resolutely fight for socialism to the end," and that he "had actually begun to take the capitalist road of exploiting others," and "if everyone were like me, I don't know how many people would be impoverished and bankrupt!" Therefore, he deeply examined his mistakes and resolved to "return to the socialist road," mobilize his father to sell the surplus grain to the state, and resolutely do a good job in mutual aid and cooperation. Obviously, this kind of ideological criticism is an extremely practical self-education for the broad masses of cadres and the masses, which will help people more resolutely abandon the capitalist road and more consciously embark on the socialist road.
    "The serious problem is educating the peasants." To make peasants understand and accept the general line, and to raise the political and ideological level of peasants to the height of socialism, is an arduous task. This requires repeated typical demonstrations and patient persuasion and education. In addition to conducting vivid, practical and in-depth socialist education aimed at the characteristics of peasants, our newspapers should also closely cooperate with the development of the local general line propaganda work and conduct timely and powerful guidance. Nanjing Xinhua Daily and Hubei Daily, on the one hand, vigorously spread the successful experiences of various regions in conducting general line propaganda to rural cadres and peasant masses, and on the other hand, promptly raised the problems existing in practical work and resolved them. For example, Nanjing Xinhua Daily prominently and systematically introduced the experience of Songjiang County in adopting the method of going from principle to specific, from specific to principle, from near to far, and from shallow to deep, and using methods such as calculating accounts, recalling, comparing, complaining, viewing exhibitions, and visiting factories, to patiently and repeatedly conduct ideological education for district and township cadres and peasants. At the same time, the newspaper pointed out in the editorial published on November 25 that the process of grassroots cadres accepting the general line "is bound to be a process of fierce struggle with spontaneous capitalist ideas," and criticized the simplistic task view of some regional leading cadres who simply talk about principles and give instructions without doing more. On December 3 and 5, short commentaries and editorials were published successively, based on the experience of advanced regions in conducting general line propaganda to the peasant masses, and aimed at the blind optimism and the eagerness to achieve quick results of some cadres, pointing out that propaganda of the general line to peasants is a very complex and meticulous task, and must adhere to the principle of persuasive education, combined with solving the current production and other issues that the masses urgently demand to be solved and that can be solved, and adopt popular and lively methods to patiently and repeatedly carry out this propaganda; and it pointed out that the propaganda of the general line to peasants should be different from the education of cadres, and the set of methods used in cadre meetings should not be mechanically applied. In addition to widely reporting on the practice of Wuchang and other counties in convening district and township cadre meetings and holding training classes for mutual aid group leaders to conduct general line education, Hubei Daily also criticized the phenomena of coercion and commandism that occurred in some areas in the movement to promote the general line to peasants and educate peasants to sell surplus grain on December 11 and 15, pointing out that it is necessary to "conduct arduous and in-depth ideological mobilization work for peasants in a correct and patient manner." In this way, the newspaper can effectively guide the local general line propaganda work to develop healthily in accordance with the correct direction.
    To promote the general line to peasants, and to fight against the spontaneous forces of the small-peasant economy, although it is an arduous task, since peasants are both small private owners and laborers, and the realization of socialism is the highest and fundamental interest of the peasants; and since in the long-term revolutionary struggle and the national construction over the past four years, the peasants have deeply understood the correctness of the leadership of the working class, the Communist Party and the People's Government; therefore, as long as the socialist future is educated to the peasants in a popular and easy-to-understand way, the broad masses of peasants will warmly support the general line and actively fight for the realization of national industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture. Fully reflecting the political enthusiasm and production initiative aroused by the broad masses after recognizing the direction and road of their advancement, and using vivid real people and real events to influence the masses, is an important method of newspaper propaganda. Nanjing Xinhua Daily and Hubei Daily have both vividly reflected this enthusiasm of the masses through news reports and reader letters. For example, Nanjing Xinhua Daily reported on November 30 that after recognizing the benefits of national socialist industrialization to peasants, the members of the Qianzhuang Township agricultural production cooperative in Yixing County sold 80,000 catties of surplus grain to the state to support national construction. The report on December 7 stated that the members of the Gong Yulin mutual aid group in Yancheng County corrected their winter slackening thoughts after understanding that "everyone is building socialism today" and actively carried out winter production. Hubei Daily reported on December 6 that after studying the general line, the Lin Baoqing mutual aid group in Wuchang County decided to sell all the surplus grain to the state and consolidate and expand the mutual aid group. The report on December 9 stated that after receiving education on the socialist future, Yu Mingshan, a productive household (member of a mutual aid group) in Gongjiaqiao Township, Wuchang County, corrected his idea of learning from rich peasants and preparing to hire a long-term worker with twelve stones of grain, and then sold all the surplus grain to the state, determined to take the road of common prosperity. These examples are just a few representative examples. Facts have proved that peasants can accept the propaganda about the general line, and peasants will warmly welcome socialism. Vigorously promoting the vivid examples of advanced peasants accepting the general line in newspapers can encourage and educate millions of masses to consciously embark on the bright road planned by the general line, and promote the progress of various tasks in rural areas.
    If socialism does not occupy the vast position in the countryside, capitalism will inevitably occupy it. Widely and deeply promoting the general line to rural cadres and peasant masses, and educating peasants to take the socialist road, is not only a sudden propaganda task of our newspapers at present, but also a regular propaganda task of our newspapers in a considerable period of time in the future. Attaching importance to this task, and implementing the education of the general line through various reports in rural areas, can greatly improve the ideology of our newspapers, and can make the general line increasingly popular in rural areas.

    为在农村中贯彻总路线而斗争
    湜辛
    党和国家在过渡时期的总路线只要为广大农村干部和农民群众所掌握，它就会成为伟大的物质力量，推动国家对农业的社会主义改造，推动当前农村中的购粮、农业生产互助合作和冬季生产等项工作顺利开展。目前许多报纸正为在农村中贯彻总路线作着极大的努力。南京新华日报和湖北日报就是这样的例子。
    要在农村中贯彻总路线，就要教育农民懂得为什么要走社会主义的道路。在进行这种教育的时候，必须采取为农民群众所容易理解和接受的方式。“因为群众，特别是农民群众，总是从亲自看到的、亲自体验到的事情上去理解问题，而不是从我们一般的宣传和口号上去理解问题。”（刘少奇：“论党”）这就要求我们的报纸善于将总路线与农民的切身利益和实际经验联系起来。南京新华日报和湖北日报在总路线的宣传中，表现了这样的特点。南京新华日报曾结合江苏省大规模宣传总路线工作的开展，通过江苏各地农民解放以来生产和生活上升的情况来算细账、找原因，教育农民从自己的切身经验来领会总路线的正确，认识国家社会主义工业化的重要；又以实际事例广泛地揭露了小农经济的落后和脆弱，来教育农民认识对农业实行社会主义改造的必要；并且通过具体介绍苏联的农业生产和农民生活情况，以及当地许多互助组、农业生产合作社多打粮食增加收入的情况，来教育农民认识社会主义的光辉远景和组织起来的优越性。如十一月三十日发表的“帮农民算账”，就以松江县农民解放以前的痛苦遭遇和土地改革以后小农经济仍然经不起风浪，抗拒不了投机商人和高利贷者的盘剥的大量事例，并以单干农民和参加互助合作的农民生产情况的鲜明对比，生动地说明了：农民要从根本上摆脱贫困而在生产上求得更大的发展，就只有走组织起来大家富裕的道路，即走社会主义的道路。湖北日报也曾结合当前各项工作，具体地分析了目前农村的情况，指出在土地改革以后，站在“十字路口”的小农经济正在沿着两条不同的道路发展。报纸以确凿的事实教育农民认识走资本主义旧道路的危害性，指出走社会主义的道路是既利于国家又利于农民的唯一正确的光明大道。
    在农村中贯彻总路线的过程，是和农民的自发的资本主义倾向作斗争的过程，是和农村中的资本主义道路作斗争的过程。因此我们的报纸必须运用群众自我教育的方式教育农民认识这种自发趋势的危险，启发他们自觉地与这种趋势进行斗争，以划清资本主义道路和社会主义道路的界限。在这一方面，教育农村干部特别是党员干部认识资本主义思想的危害，是十分重要的。因为“我们的革命依靠干部”，“党依靠着这些人而联系党员和群众”（“毛泽东选集”北京第二版第二六八、二六七页）；弄通干部的思想，是在农村中贯彻总路线的首要关键。南京新华日报，特别是湖北日报，在总路线的宣传中重视了这个环节。例如湖北日报十一月一日在介绍鄂城县芦洲乡许用祥互助组正确开展副业生产、并与供销合作社订立供销合同的同时，又批评了麻城县丁家寨乡二十五个互助组以“互助副业”为名合股开行做投机生意和浠水县徐定学农业生产合作社贩卖竹木经营商业的错误；十一月二十日在介绍武昌县祝祠乡熊华庶互助组正确处理余粮，把粮食卖给国家扩大再生产的同时，又批评了新洲县花园乡郭家岗村村长郭云洲等假借互助组名义运用余粮余资大做投机生意的错误。这就向农村干部和农民群众具体地指明了应该怎样做，不应该怎样做。湖北日报还辟了“向社会主义道路前进，决不走资本主义道路”的专栏，发表各地区乡干部和共产党员在学习总路线后对自己的资本主义思想和行为的自我批判。十二月六日发表的当阳县天成乡乡长郑心明所写“我认识到走资本主义道路的错误”一文，就说明贫农出身的共产党员郑心明，在土地改革以后连年获得丰收，因而改善了生活的情况下，竟“好了疮疤忘了痛”，接受了富农思想的影响，走上了做生意、买青苗的资本主义道路。从此郑心明不再想当干部，也不想搞互助合作，而是一心想个人发财。及至这次参加了当阳县的扩大干部会议，学习了总路线，联想到本乡已有一些农民被高利贷者剥削得没有粮食吃等阶级分化的情况，又联系到过去自己身受的地主高利贷者压榨的痛苦，才恍然大悟，认识到“共产党领导我们翻了身，我也入了党，是应该坚决为社会主义奋斗到底”，而自己“实际上已开始走向剥削别人的资本主义的道路”，“如果都像我这样下去，又不知有多少人要贫困破产！”于是他沉痛地检讨了自己的错误，决心“回到社会主义的道路”，动员他父亲将余粮卖给国家，并要坚决搞好互助合作。显然，这种思想批判对于广大干部群众是一种极为实际的自我教育，它将帮助人们更坚决地抛弃资本主义的道路，更自觉地走上社会主义的道路。
      “严重的问题是教育农民。”要使农民懂得和接受总路线，要把农民的政治思想水平提高到社会主义的高度，是一件艰巨的工作。这要依靠反复的典型示范和耐心的说服教育。我们的报纸除自身应该针对农民的特点进行生动、实际和深入的社会主义教育外，还应该紧密配合当地总路线宣传工作的开展，进行及时而有力的指导。南京新华日报和湖北日报一方面大力传播了各地向农村干部和农民群众进行总路线宣传的成功经验，另一方面适时地提出了实际工作中存在的问题，并加以解决。例如南京新华日报就曾突出地、系统地介绍了松江县采取由原则到具体、由具体到原则、由近及远、由浅入深的办法，并运用算账、回忆、对比、诉苦、看展览会、参观工厂等方式，向区乡干部和农民耐心地反复地进行思想教育的经验。与此同时，报纸在十一月二十五日发表的社论中，指出基层干部接受总路线的过程“必然是同自发的资本主义思想进行激烈斗争的过程”，批评了某些地区领导干部简单讲一片道理，交代一下任务就算了事的单纯任务观点。十二月三日、五日又先后发表短评和社论，根据先进地区向农民群众进行总路线宣传的经验，针对某些干部的盲目乐观情绪和急于求成的急躁情绪，指出对农民宣传总路线是一项十分复杂和细致的工作，必须坚持说服教育的原则，结合解决当前生产及其他群众迫切要求解决而又可能解决的问题，采用通俗活泼的方法，耐心地反复地进行这项宣传；并指出对农民宣传总路线，应该与对干部的教育有所区别，不能拿干部会议的一套生硬搬用。湖北日报除广泛地报道了武昌等县召开区乡干部会议和举办互助组长训练班进行总路线教育的作法外，也曾在十二月十一日、十五日对部分地区在向农民宣传总路线和教育农民出售余粮的运动中产生的强迫命令现象提出批评，指出必须“正确的耐心的向农民进行艰苦深入的思想发动工作”。这样，报纸就能够有效地指导当地的总路线宣传工作按照正确的方针健康地发展。
    向农民进行总路线的宣传，和小农经济的自发势力作斗争，虽然是一件艰巨的工作，但由于农民一方面是小私有者，另一方面又是劳动者，实现社会主义是农民的最高的和根本的利益所在；又由于在长期的革命斗争和四年来的国家建设中，农民已经深刻地领会到工人阶级、共产党和人民政府领导的正确；因此只要通俗易懂地向农民进行社会主义前途的教育，广大农民就会热烈地拥护总路线，并积极地为实现国家工业化和农业的社会主义改造而斗争。充分地反映广大群众在认识了自己前进的方向和道路之后所激发起来的政治热情和生产积极性，用生动的真人真事来影响群众，是报纸宣传的重要方法。南京新华日报和湖北日报都曾通过新闻报道和读者来信等方式生动地反映了群众的这种热情。如南京新华日报十一月三十日报道的宜兴县前庄町农业生产合作社社员认识到国家社会主义工业化对农民的好处后，即将八万斤余粮卖给国家，支持国家建设。十二月七日报道的盐城县龚玉林互助组组员懂得今天“大家正在建设社会主义”后纠正了冬闲歇劲思想，积极开展冬季生产。湖北日报十二月六日报道的武昌县林宝卿互助组经过学习总路线，决定把全部余粮卖给国家，并巩固和扩大了互助组。十二月九日报道的武昌县龚家桥乡丰产户余明山
  （互助组员）在受到社会主义前途教育后，纠正了打算向富农学样、准备以十二石谷请个长工的想法以后，就将全部余粮卖给国家，决心走大家富裕的道路。这些事例就是几个具有代表性的例子。事实证明：农民能够接受关于总路线的宣传，农民是会热烈欢迎社会主义的。报纸大力宣扬先进农民接受总路线的生动范例，就能够鼓舞和教育千百万群众自觉地走上总路线所规划的光明大道，并推动农村中的各项工作前进。
    农村中的广大阵地，社会主义不去占领，资本主义必去占领。向农村干部和农民群众广泛深入地宣传总路线，教育农民走社会主义的道路，不仅是我们报纸当前的一项突击性的宣传任务，并且是我们报纸在今后相当长时期内的一项经常性的宣传任务。重视这项任务，通过农村的各项报道来贯彻总路线的教育，就能使我们报纸的思想性大大提高一步，就能使总路线在农村中日益深入人心。
