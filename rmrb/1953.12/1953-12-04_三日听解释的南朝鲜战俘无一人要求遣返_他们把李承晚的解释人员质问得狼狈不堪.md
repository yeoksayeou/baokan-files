Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 3rd: For the third day, another thirty South Korean POWs quietly accepted explanations. As on the 2nd, none of these thirty POWs requested repatriation, although the Korean and Chinese side, based on their consistent position that all POWs should be repatriated, had repeatedly advised them to return home.

Each POW who came to listen to the explanations wore blue winter clothing and cotton overcoats, without the letters "PW" on their clothes. In stark contrast to the situation during the explanation work at Tongchang-ri, the POWs brought neither slogans nor knives, stones, or disinfectant powder to harm the explanation personnel and Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC) personnel. They did not shout hysterically but calmly walked into the tents. They quietly listened to the explanations according to the provisions of the "working rules" told to them by the NNSC, sometimes taking notes with pens and paper, and smokers smoked cigarettes while listening. When they wanted to ask the explanation personnel questions, they first obtained the consent of the Indian chairman of the NNSC subsidiary body. The Indian chairman of the subsidiary body told the POWs: "I am very grateful for your orderliness, quietness, and composure!" This situation clearly saddened the American propagandists who had fabricated the lie that South Korean POWs were under so-called "special agent control" and "predicted" that they would make a lot of noise. Like on the 2nd, the five explanation personnel of the Syngman Rhee group came to the explanation site with their large briefcases and recording equipment. They played records and recordings for the POWs without any interference, showed them photos, read out proclamations, and gave full oral explanations.

In the first explanation tent, Syngman Rhee's explanation personnel said to a POW: "How many tears did your parents shed for you during the Mid-Autumn Festival this year! Don't you miss them?" The POW said: "I do. During the Mid-Autumn Festival, the comrades in the POW camp saw me grieve and cry because I missed my parents, but my parents were arrested and killed by your police years ago!"

In the same tent, another POW quietly listened to various forms of explanation for one hour and two minutes. After listening to the explanation, he said to the Syngman Rhee explanation personnel: "You say South Korea is good, but I had no food to eat at home; you say the United States is good, but American soldiers raped my sisters at will; you used to deceive me by saying that if I were captured by the People's Army and the Volunteer Army, my nose and eyes would be dug out, but now look, have my nose and eyes been dug out?"

Some POWs even asked some questions after listening to the explanations and asked for answers. These questions were: "What is the situation in South Korea now? Why are there so many beggars?" "Why did you only come to explain now?" "Who started the war?" Faced with these questions, the Syngman Rhee's explanation personnel either refused to answer, claiming that these were "political questions," or asked the chairman of the NNSC subsidiary body for help, requesting the chairman to take the POW who asked the questions away, in order to escape the embarrassing situation. In order to avoid being embarrassed by the questions raised by the POWs, according to the International News Service, the leader of the South Korean "explanation group" has ordered his explanation personnel not to give the POWs a chance to speak unless it is the end of the visit.

In the first tent, a translator from the Syngman Rhee group told a POW that the door for applying for repatriation was the door for not applying for repatriation, and the POW walked out of that door. This made the Syngman Rhee group and American reporters rush forward excitedly. But after the chairman of the NNSC subsidiary body informed the POW that he had gone to the wrong place, the POW returned to the tent and rebuked the translator from the Syngman Rhee group, saying: "You must translate properly next time. I am not repatriating, why did you tell me to go out that door?"

At the end of today's explanation, the thirty Rhee puppet army POWs who had listened to the explanations but did not request repatriation were taken to the isolation camp. There, they can listen to explanations and apply for repatriation again.

    三日听解释的南朝鲜战俘无一人要求遣返
    他们把李承晚的解释人员质问得狼狈不堪
    【新华社开城三日电】今天又有三十名南朝鲜战俘安静地接受了解释。和二日一样，这三十名战俘没有一个要求遣返，虽然朝中方面根据战俘应该全部遣返的一贯主张，曾经多次劝说他们回家。
    每个前来听解释的战俘都穿着蓝色的冬衣和棉大衣，衣服上没有写着“PW”字样。和东场里解释工作进行时的情形截然相反，战俘们既未带任何标语，更没有带用以伤害解释人员和中立国人员的刀子、石头或消毒粉。他们没有歇斯底里地叫喊，而是镇静地走进帐篷。他们按照中立国遣返委员会告诉他们的“工作细则”的规定，静静地听着解释，有时拿着笔和纸认真地记着笔记，会抽烟的就抽着香烟听。他们要向解释人员提问题时，都事先取得中立国遣返委员会附属机构印度主席的同意。附属机构印度主席对战俘说：“我非常感谢你的遵守秩序、安静和沉着！”这种情形显然使曾经捏造南朝鲜战俘受所谓“特务控制”的谎言、并且“预测”他们要大吵大闹的美国宣传家们大为伤心。像二日一样，李承晚集团的五个解释人员带着他们的大皮包、录音器，来到解释场所。他们在没有任何干扰的条件下向战俘放送唱片、录音，给战俘看了照片，宣读了文告，并作了充分的口头解释。
    在第一号解释帐篷，李承晚的解释人员对一个战俘说：“在今年中秋节的时候，你的父母为你流了多少泪啊！你难道不想他们吗？”战俘说：“想的。在中秋节的时候，战俘营里的伙伴们都看到我因为想念父母而伤心流泪，我的父母在几年前就被你们的警察抓去杀掉了！”
    在同一个帐篷里，还有一个战俘静静地听了一小时零二十分钟各种形式的解释，在听完解释后，他对李承晚解释人员说：“你说南朝鲜好，可是我在家没有饭吃；你说美国好，可是美国兵却任意强奸我的同胞姊妹；你们过去骗我说被人民军、志愿军俘掳后会挖掉鼻子、眼睛，现在你看我的鼻子、眼睛挖掉了没有？”
    有的战俘在听完解释以后还提出一些问题要求答复。这些问题是：“现在南朝鲜的情况怎样？为什么那么多的乞丐？”“你们为什么到现在才来解释？”“战争是谁发动的？”面对着这些问题，李承晚的解释人员不是推说这是“政治问题”，拒绝回答，就是向中立国遣返委员会附属机构主席求救，要求主席把提问题的战俘带走，借以逃出窘境。为了避免被战俘提出的问题弄得狼狈不堪，据国际新闻社报道，南朝鲜的“解释组”组长已经命令他的解释人员：除非到了访问结束的时候，不要给予战俘发言的机会。
    在第一号帐篷，一个李承晚集团的翻译把申请遣返的门当作不申请遣返的门告诉战俘，这个战俘便从那个门走了出去。这引得李承晚集团的人员和美国记者们兴奋地奔上前来。可是等到中立国遣返委员会附属机构主席通知战俘走错了以后，战俘就回到帐篷来责备李承晚集团的翻译说：“你下次可是要好好翻译，我不遣返，你为什么叫我走那个门出去？”
    在今天解释终了的时候，听过解释而没有要求遣返的三十名李伪军战俘都被带到了隔离营场。在那里，他们还可以再听取解释和申请遣返。
