Herdsmen in Inner Mongolia-Suiyuan and Northwest China Stock Up on Fodder to Protect Livestock Through Winter
This winter, all regions are paying more attention to the work of protecting livestock through the winter than in previous years. The Inner Mongolia-Suiyuan region has completed the preparations for livestock to spend the winter; farmers and herdsmen in Northwest China, North China, Guizhou, Hubei, Hunan, Henan, and Shandong provinces are actively cutting and storing grass to protect livestock through the winter.

The herdsmen in the Inner Mongolia-Suiyuan region, driving millions of cattle and sheep, have successively entered the winter pastures. Since autumn, all parts of the region have been working hard to gain autumn膘 (qiū biāo, autumn fat - 秋膘 refers to the practice of eating more nutritious foods in the autumn to prepare for the winter), prevent and control animal diseases, cut and store winter grass, and repair enclosures and sheds. Many places have also surveyed and adjusted pastures to prepare livestock for the winter. After grazing in the autumn, the livestock in the pastoral areas of the leagues in the eastern part of Inner Mongolia have mostly grown fat and strong. Four pastoral banners in the Hulunbuir League have surveyed a large area of pastures that can accommodate 1.6 million head of livestock for the winter. Since the beginning of November, herdsmen in various banners have organized winter mutual aid groups and have successively moved large herds of livestock into winter pastures. Mongolian herdsmen in the Ik Zhao League and Ulanqab League in Suiyuan Province also try their best to use pastures with better water and grass for livestock to spend the winter.

All regions pay special attention to the reserve of livestock feed this winter. This year, the eastern pastoral area of Inner Mongolia set a goal of cutting 3 billion catties of grass. According to the inspection report of the Inner Mongolia Department of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, the Hulunbuir League alone can complete the task of cutting 1.2 billion catties of grass. Herdsmen in the Xin Barag Left Banner cut and stored more than 20 million catties of winter grass and purchased a large amount of bean cake, soybean oil, and oats from supply and marketing cooperatives. Recently, various banners in the pastoral area of Suiyuan Province have generally held material exchange conferences. At the conferences, herdsmen sold old and weak livestock and fur, and purchased timber for building sheds and feed for livestock. Herdsmen of all ethnic groups in the Northwest pastoral area are also actively carrying out grass storage and winter preparation work. According to incomplete statistics in Xinjiang Province, 1 billion catties of grass have been cut. During the grass cutting period, local people's governments paid special attention to poor herdsmen and helped them rent pastures and cut grass with mutual assistance. Because most areas of Ningxia Province are dry and the original pasture grass is very short, the method of demarcating and sealing pastures was implemented. Now, in the Alxa League Mongolian Autonomous Region and Zhongwei, Lingwu, Huinong and other counties, the pasture grass in the 67 demarcated pastures has grown more than one foot high. The pastures demarcated by Zhongwei County alone can provide winter feed for more than 40,000 sheep in the area. In the North China region, according to statistics from 39 townships in 5 counties in the three special districts of Zhangjiakou, Tianjin, and Tongxian in Hebei Province, 29.46 million catties of hay have been cut, with an average of 1,500 catties of winter grass stored for each large animal. In other provinces such as Guizhou, Hubei, Hunan, Henan, and Shandong, many farmers are also actively storing feed to protect livestock through the winter safely.

Party and government leaders in various regions have strengthened their leadership over winter livestock protection work. The People's Government of the Inner Mongolia-Suiyuan region regards this work as the central task of the pastoral area this winter and next spring. As early as July this year, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region sent personnel to various leagues to conduct key inspections on this work to help solve problems such as pastures. At present, the Autonomous Region People's Government has sent working groups to various pastoral areas to inspect livestock wintering work. Responsible cadres of the league and banner people's governments have also gone deep into pastoral areas to specifically guide herdsmen to organize labor mutual assistance and increase various livestock protection facilities. The provinces in Northwest China have also successively sent large numbers of cadres to help farmers and herdsmen in various places carry out grass cutting work. While leading farmers and herdsmen to cut grass, various places have also planned to supply farmers and herdsmen with various grass cutting tools and loans, which has solved many practical difficulties in storing winter grass. Inner Mongolia used animal husbandry loans to distribute 110 sets of grass cutting machines and mowing machines, and trained more than 40 grass cutting personnel. In addition to issuing 2.6 billion yuan in livestock protection loans, the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government also supplied 30 horse-drawn mowing machines and 1,800 flat sickles for grass cutting to various places. Ningxia Province has used loans to provide winter feed for more than 110,000 sheep to herdsmen.

    蒙绥、西北等地牧民贮备饲草保护牲畜过冬
    今冬各地都比往年重视保护牲畜过冬的工作。蒙绥地区已经完成牲畜过冬准备工作；西北、华北各地及贵州、湖北、湖南、河南和山东等省农牧民，都积极打草储草，保护牲畜过冬。
    蒙绥地区的牧民们，赶着数百万头牛、羊，先后进入冬营牧场。该区各地在入秋以后，就紧张地进行了抓秋膘、防治畜病、割储冬草、修圈搭棚等工作。许多地方还勘查、调剂了牧场，给牲畜过冬做好准备工作。内蒙古东部区各盟牧区牲畜经过秋季放牧后，牲畜大都长得肥壮了。呼纳盟四个牧业旗勘查出大片牧场，可以容纳一百六十万头牲畜过冬，各旗牧民纷纷组织了过冬互助组，自十一月初起，即把大群牲畜陆续移入冬营牧场。绥远伊克昭盟、乌兰察布盟的蒙族牧民，也尽量利用水草较好的牧场给畜群过冬。
    各地特别注意今年冬季牲畜饲料的储备。内蒙东部牧区今年确定了打草三十亿斤的目标，据内蒙农牧部检查报告，只呼纳盟就可完成十二亿斤的打草任务。新巴尔虎左翼旗牧民割储冬草二千多万斤，并从供销合作社购进了大量豆饼、豆油和燕麦。绥远省牧区各旗最近普遍举行了物资交流大会，牧民们在会上出售了老弱牲畜和皮毛，添置了搭盖棚圈用的木材和喂畜饲料。西北牧区各族牧民，目前也积极进行储草备冬工作。据新疆省不完全统计，现已打草十亿斤；在打草期中，各地人民政府特别照顾了贫苦牧民，帮助他们租入草场互助打草。宁夏省大部分地区因为干旱，原来牧草很矮，因此实行了划封草场的办法，现在阿拉善旗蒙族自治区和中卫、灵武、惠农等县，所划六十七块草场中，牧草都已长了一尺多高，只中卫县划封的草场，就可供当地四万多只羊的过冬饲料。华北区的河北省，现据张家口、天津、通县三个专区五个县三十九个乡的统计，已打了干草二千九百四十六万斤，平均为每头大牲口贮备了一千五百斤冬草。其他如贵州、湖北、湖南、河南和山东等省，也有很多农民积极贮备饲草，保护牲畜安全过冬。
    各地党政领导方面，都对冬季保畜工作加强了领导。蒙绥地区人民政府把这一工作当作牧区今冬明春的中心工作。内蒙古自治区早在今年七月初就派员到各盟作了关于这一工作的重点检查，帮助解决草场等问题。目前自治区人民政府又已派出工作组到各牧区检查牲畜过冬工作，各盟、旗人民政府负责干部也纷纷深入牧区，具体领导牧民组织劳动互助，增加各项保畜设备。西北各省也先后派出大批干部，帮助各地农牧民开展打草工作。各地在领导农牧民打草的同时，并有计划地供给农牧民各种打草工具和贷款，解决了贮备冬草中的许多实际困难问题。内蒙古利用畜牧贷款发放了一百一十套打草机、搂草机，并培养了打草人员四十多名。新疆省人民政府除发放了保畜贷款二十六亿元外，并供应了各地三十台马拉割草机和一千八百把割草用的扁形镰刀。宁夏省利用贷款已贷给牧民可喂十一万多只羊的过冬饲料。
