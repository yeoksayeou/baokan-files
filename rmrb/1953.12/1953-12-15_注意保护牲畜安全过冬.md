    Pay Attention to Protecting Livestock and Ensuring Safe Wintering
    Central Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Bureau
    The late winter and early spring is the most difficult season for raising livestock. According to past experience, whether in agricultural or pastoral areas, the most livestock deaths occur in winter due to insufficient feed and natural disasters. For example, in the Chahar League and Xilin Gol League of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, nearly 50,000 head of livestock, large and small, were lost in a blizzard in the spring of 1950. In Shiqu County, Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang, a count of only six villages in the blizzard of 1951 showed 7,354 cattle, 571 horses, and more than 23,300 sheep frozen and starved to death. Similar situations also exist in agricultural areas. For example, in Hunan Province in the winter of 1950 and the spring of 1951, more than 40,000 head of draught cattle died due to poor feeding management. This year, some areas have suffered from more serious waterlogging, drought, and pest disasters, reducing the output of livestock feed. This makes how to protect livestock and ensure safe wintering an important issue in current agricultural and livestock production.
    In order to protect livestock and ensure safe wintering, party and government leading bodies in various regions have adopted various effective measures. For example, Qinghai, Ningxia, and other provinces, in addition to actively helping the masses dig wells and build canals to open up water sources for pastures, have also adopted the method of moving livestock to where feed is available, driving livestock to areas with water and grass for the winter. Lü Dongyang Agricultural Production Cooperative, a labor model in Anhui Province, crushed bean stalks to solve the problem of livestock feed shortage. In particular, this year, various regions have focused more closely on the work of cutting and storing grass, and some regions have achieved considerable results. For example, Xinjiang Province has cut 1 billion jin of grass, and Tongxian County, Tianjin, and Zhangjiakou three special districts in Hebei Province have cut more than 29.29 million jin of grass. However, the progress of this work is still very uneven. Therefore, various regions must further implement the following tasks:
    (1) Continue to mobilize the masses to reserve feed. Although the season for cutting grass in northern pastoral areas has passed, it is still necessary to continue to mobilize the masses to collect as much wild hay and leaves as possible as winter feed for livestock. In agricultural areas, full use should be made of various agricultural by-products such as rice husks, sorghum husks, cottonseed skins, bran, rice bran, oil cakes, and stalks of field crops, as well as vines of crops such as potatoes, beans, and peanuts, and stems and leaves of various vegetables and sunflowers as feed. Pastoral areas with insufficient pastures should promptly organize the masses to survey winter camps and, by promoting the spirit of unity and mutual assistance, rationally adjust pastures through consultation to expand the area of grassland utilization. However, in carrying out this work, it is necessary to prevent the seizure of pastures or blind relocation of pastures, resulting in losses. Pastoral areas with warmer climates can appropriately delay the time of entering winter camps to store more winter grass. In disaster areas and areas with particularly severe feed shortages, in addition to using livestock protection loans to organize the purchase and transportation of feed, the masses should be mobilized to help each other on a voluntary basis and mobilize the masses to use relatives and friends in other places to raise or move livestock to grass to protect livestock. At the same time, in areas with bumper crops this year, it is necessary to implement increased production and conservation, pay attention to the feeding methods of livestock, and correct the phenomenon of receiving more and feeding more, wasting grain and feed.
    (2) Build cold-proof facilities and prevent animal pests. In order to avoid the invasion of wind and snow, various regions should, according to the habits and different conditions of the masses, mobilize the masses to use stones, clods, dung bricks, sand sagebrush, willow strips, etc. to build sheds and pens, or build earthen windbreaks to increase cold-proof facilities, and check and repair old sheds and pens. In areas with conditions such as Inner Mongolia and Suiyuan, attention should be paid to making forecasts of blizzards in advance, defending in time, and reducing losses. Carrying out hunting to protect livestock in pastoral areas is also a very important task. Various pastoral areas can adopt joint prevention methods to vigorously eliminate wolf damage. In areas accustomed to grazing wild cattle, it is necessary to promote grazing with the herd to reduce damage from wild animals.
    (3) Prevent and treat livestock diseases, and protect pregnant and young livestock. Livestock are mostly malnourished and physically weak in the cold winter season. Therefore, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the policy of prevention being more important than treatment, improve livestock feeding management, and reduce the occurrence of livestock diseases. In agricultural areas, the masses can be mobilized to clean livestock sheds in conjunction with winter manure accumulation work, frequently remove manure and frequently pad pens, which can both accumulate fertilizer, preserve fertilizer efficiency, and make stables clean and dry, reducing the breeding of diseases. Special attention should be paid to the care of already pregnant female animals. When grazing, pregnant livestock should avoid crowding. In areas with conditions, it is best to separate pregnant livestock into groups and graze them nearby to do a good job of protecting the fetus. Draught livestock should avoid heavy labor before giving birth to prevent miscarriage. In areas that produce winter lambs, the herders should be led to prepare for lambing to improve the survival rate of young livestock.
    In carrying out the winter livestock protection work, in order to solve the difficulties of insufficient manpower and material resources, pastoral areas should organize mutual aid organizations in different forms such as lambing, wolf hunting, and moving pens on the principle of voluntary mutual benefit among the masses. Agricultural areas should use the slack farming time in winter to convene livestock-raising models, traditional Chinese veterinary doctors, breeding experts, and active members of rural livestock protection work for short-term training, cultivate grassroots livestock protection backbones, take the lead in promoting livestock protection work, and strive to ensure that as few livestock as possible die or die this winter and next spring, and lay a good foundation for next year's agricultural preparation work and livestock production.

    注意保护牲畜安全过冬
    中央农业部畜牧兽医总局
    冬末春初是饲养牲畜最困难的季节，根据以往经验，无论农区或牧区，每年由于饲料不足和自然灾害的侵袭。牲畜在冬季死亡最多。如内蒙古自治区的察哈尔盟和锡林郭勒盟在一九五○年春季的一次大风雪中损失大小牲畜近五万头，西康藏族自治区石渠县，在一九五一年的大风雪中，仅六个村的统计，即冻死饿死牛七千三百五十四头，马五百七十一匹，羊二万三千三百余只，就是在农业地区也有这种类似情况，如湖南省在一九五○年冬和一九五一年春，因为饲养管理不好，死亡耕牛四万多头。今年有些地区因为遭受较严重的水旱病虫灾害，牲畜饲草产量减少，更使如何保护牲畜安全过冬成为当前农牧业生产的一个重要问题。
    为了保护牲畜安全过冬，各地党政领导机关已采取了各种有效措施。如青海、宁夏等省，除积极帮助群众打井修渠开辟牧场水源外，并采取了移畜就食办法，将牲畜赶至有水草的地区过冬。安徽省劳动模范吕东阳农业生产合作社把豆秸压碎，解决了牲畜缺草的问题。特别是今年各地对打草贮草工作抓的较紧，有些地区已收到不少成绩。如新疆省已打草十亿斤，河北省通县、天津、张家口三个专区已打草二千九百余万斤。但目前这一工作还进行得极不平衡，因此，各地还必须进一步贯彻以下几项工作：
    （一）继续发动群众储备草料。目前虽然北方牧区打草的季节已过，但仍应继续发动群众尽可能地多收集野干草、树叶等作为牲畜过冬饲料。在农区应充分利用谷糠、高粱壳、棉子皮、麸皮、米糠、油饼等各种农业副产品和大田作物的秸秆，以及薯、豆、花生等类作物的藤蔓，各种蔬菜和向日葵的茎叶作为饲料。草场不够的牧区，应及时组织群众勘察冬营地，并在发扬团结互助的精神下通过协商方式，合理调济草场，扩大草原的利用面积。但在进行这一工作时，必须防止抢占牧场，或盲目倒场，以致造成损失。气候较暖和的牧区可适当延迟进入冬营地的时间，以贮留较多的冬草。在灾区和饲料特别缺乏地区，除利用保畜贷款组织购运草料外，应在自愿原则下，发动群众互助互济，动员群众利用外地亲友关系寄养或移畜就草等办法保护牲畜。同时，在今年农作物丰收的地区，必须贯彻增产节约，注意对牲畜的饲养方法，纠正多收多喂，浪费粮食、草料等现象。
    （二）修建防寒设备，防除兽害。为避免风雪的侵袭，各地应根据群众习惯和不同条件，因地制宜地发动群众利用石头、土块、粪砖、沙蒿、柳条等物修棚搭圈，或修筑土围风障，以增加防寒设备，并检查修补旧有棚圈。在内蒙古、绥远等有条件地区，应注意作好大风雪的预报工作，及时防御，减少损失。在牧区开展打猎保畜也是一件很重要的工作，各个牧区可以采用联防办法，大力消除狼害。在习惯放野牛地区应提倡随群放牧减少野兽损害。
    （三）防治牲畜疾病，保护孕畜、幼畜。牲畜在冬寒季节大多营养不良，体质瘦弱，因此必须认真贯彻防重于治的方针，改善牲畜饲养管理，减少牲畜疫病的发生。在农区可结合冬季积肥工作动员群众清扫畜舍，勤除粪、勤垫圈，这样既可积贮肥料，保存肥效，又能使厩舍清洁干燥，减少疾病的孳生。对已经受胎的母畜应特别注意护理。在放牧时，孕畜应避免拥挤，在有条件的地区，最好将孕畜分群就近放牧，作好保胎工作。役用家畜在产前应避免重役，以防流产。在产冬羔的地区，则应领导牧民搞好接羔准备工作，提高幼畜成活率。
    在开展冬季保畜工作中，为了解决人力、物力不足的困难，牧区应在群众自愿互利的原则下，组织接羔、打狼、搬圈等不同形式的互助组织。农区应利用冬季农闲时间，召集养畜模范、中兽医、配种能手和乡村保畜工作的积极分子进行短期训练，培养基层保畜骨干，带头推动保畜工作，争取在今冬明春尽可能做到不死或少死牲畜，给明年农业备耕工作和畜牧生产打好基础。
