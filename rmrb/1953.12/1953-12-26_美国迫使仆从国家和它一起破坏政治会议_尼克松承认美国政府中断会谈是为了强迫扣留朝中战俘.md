Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 23rd: A special correspondent for this agency reports: The United States is now intimidating other countries that sent troops to invade Korea, trying to make them believe that it is useless to hold a political conference to seek a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue.

According to the United Press, after Arthur Dean sabotaged the bilateral talks on the political conference issue and returned to Washington, he comforted representatives of other countries that sent troops to invade Korea at a secret meeting held at the US State Department on the evening of the 21st. He said that the United States would postpone the Korean political conference to some time in the spring or early summer of next year in order to resolve the issue of Korean reunification. However, Dean immediately scared the representatives of these countries by saying that once Korea was peacefully unified, the communists would use so-called "infiltration tactics" throughout Korea, and that this would "directly threaten Japan."

Dean's nonsense actually means that the United States does not want to hold a political conference, nor does it want to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, and it is trying to force other countries to follow the United States. This proves that Dean came to Panmunjom and fooled around for seven weeks, his purpose was only to deceive world opinion and close the door to convening a political conference, and not to hold a political conference as soon as possible to seek a solution to the various issues stipulated in the armistice agreement.

Xinhua News Agency, December 24th: US Vice President Nixon said in a report broadcast nationwide on the 23rd that he had noticed that Arthur Dean was "criticized for not agreeing to hold a political conference with the Communists." He tried his best to defend Dean from such criticism. He said: "The Communists know that they can hold a political conference under any reasonable conditions they are willing to agree to." Of course, fair and reasonable conditions are what we are willing to agree to, but why is the US unwilling to agree to hold a political conference under fair and reasonable conditions? Nixon replied that if the US did so, it would be "abandoning the principles they fought for" and would therefore be "doing the next thing that would let down the tens of thousands of soldiers who died in the Korean War." Everyone knows what the "principles" that people like Nixon fought for are. The open name of this "principle" is "voluntary repatriation," but in reality it is the forced detention of prisoners of war using the most barbaric and cruel violence and threats of violence. Nixon's words actually admit that the US government, in order to forcibly detain prisoners of war and achieve the so-called "victory" of "psychological warfare," is willing to sacrifice the lives of tens of thousands of American youths. The US is now unwilling to explain to their prisoners of war, and even wants to cut off the explanation period, which is obviously based on the same shameful policy. In order to implement this policy, even though the US knows that there can be fair and reasonable conditions, and even though they know that we are willing to agree to fair and reasonable conditions, they still cannot agree to these conditions and must sabotage the convening of the political conference. This is the fact that Nixon confessed.

### 美国迫使仆从国家和它一起破坏政治会议  尼克松承认美国政府中断会谈是为了强迫扣留朝中战俘

    尼克松承认美国政府中断会谈是为了强迫扣留朝中战俘
    【新华社开城二十三日电】本社特派记者报道：美国现在正在恫吓出兵侵朝的其他国家，要它们相信举行政治会议谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决是没有好处的。
    据合众社透露，阿瑟·迪安在破坏了关于政治会议问题的双方会谈回到华盛顿以后，二十一日晚在美国国务院举行的一次秘密会议上，安慰出兵侵朝的其他国家的代表说，美国将要把朝鲜政治会议拖到明年春季或夏初某一时候再召开，以便解决统一朝鲜问题。但是迪安马上就吓唬这些国家的代表，说什么一旦朝鲜和平统一以后，共产党人就会在朝鲜全国运用所谓“渗透策略”，并且说这样就会“直接威胁日本”。
    迪安的这些鬼话，实际上就是表示美国并不想举行政治会议，也不想和平解决朝鲜问题，而且企图强迫其他国家跟着美国走。这证明了：迪安到板门店来鬼混了七个星期，其目的只是为了欺骗世界舆论，关上召开政治会议的大门，而并不是为了早日举行政治会议，谋求停战协定中所规定的各项问题的解决。
    【新华社二十四日讯】美国副总统尼克松二十三日在一篇向美国全国广播的报告中说，他已经注意到阿瑟·迪安“因为没有同意和共产党举行政治会议而受到批评”。他竭力替迪安所受到的这种批评抱屈。他说：“共方知道他们可以在任何他们愿意同意的合理条件下举行政治会议。”当然，公平合理的条件是我方所愿意同意的，但是美方为什么不愿意同意在公平合理的条件下举行政治会议呢？尼克松回答说，如果美方这样做，就是“放弃他们所为之而战斗的原则”，因此就会“做下一件对不起成千上万在朝鲜战争中牺牲的士兵的事情”。大家知道尼克松之流所谓的为之而战的“原则”是什么。这个“原则”的公开名称是“自愿遣返”，实际则是用最野蛮、最残酷的暴力和暴力威胁来强迫扣留战俘。尼克松的话，实际上就是承认美国政府为了强迫扣留战俘、取得“心理战”的所谓“胜利”，不惜牺牲成千上万美国青年的性命。美方现在宁可不对他们的战俘进行解释，也要截止解释期限，显然也是根据这同一个可耻的政策。为了执行这个政策，美方虽明知可以有公平合理的条件，虽明知我方愿意同意公平合理的条件，他们还是不能同意这些条件，而必须破坏政治会议的召开。这就是尼克松所招认的事实。
