Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, December 29th: Since the autumn harvest this year, especially after the recent promotion of the general line for the transition period, farmers in various parts of Anhui Province have enthusiastically sold their grain to support the country's industrialization. The amount of grain purchased by the grain departments of Anhui Province has exceeded any previous year. Therefore, the original grain warehouses are not sufficient. The grain departments of Anhui Province are now taking various measures to overcome this difficulty. Wuhu, Anqing, Liu'an and other special districts, although with better warehouse conditions, still lack grain storage for 300 to 400 million *jin*. The grain departments actively organize transportation, and transfer the purchased rice in these areas to cities with more warehouses for storage in a timely manner. Nearly 500 million *jin* of grain in the Huaibei area have no warehouses to accommodate them. The grain departments first try their best to rationally use existing warehouses, and improve the warehouse capacity by changing packaging to bulk and other methods. Fuyang Special District alone used this method to store more than 47 million *jin* of grain in the original warehouses. At the same time, local grain departments, with the assistance of local administrative departments, rent private houses or sign agreements with the masses (paying a storage fee of one-thousandth), entrusting the grain to the masses for safekeeping. Renting private houses in Fuyang Special District can solve the warehouse capacity for 70 million *jin* of grain, and Suxian Special District is entrusting more than 100 million *jin* of grain to the masses for safekeeping. At present, the problem of storage capacity in various parts of the province can be basically solved. The staff of the grain departments at all levels are actively carrying out warehouse cleaning, disinfection, and grain turning to prevent grain mildew.
[This Newspaper] Shanxi Province, Jie County, after completing the grain purchase task, promptly and conscientiously carried out grain storage work.

    Jie County had overfulfilled its grain purchase task by December 3rd, and began grain storage work on the 2nd. In order to ensure the success of this work, the Jie County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party instructed all townships that, from mobilizing the masses to sell surplus grain to doing a good job in grain storage, it is necessary to always implement the political education of the general line. The instructions required all cadres not to be arrogant, complacent, slack, or麻痹（paralyzed), but to educate the masses to dry and clean the grain when handing over grain, without mixing soil or chaff, so that every household delivers good grain. After receiving the instructions, the townships in Jie County made serious arrangements and immediately launched a propaganda and mobilization campaign for grain storage among the masses. All townships held mass meetings to celebrate the successful completion of the national grain purchase task, and put forward the slogan of completing the grain storage task by 100%. For example, Chichi, Xiwang, Xiaozhangwu and other villages explained the benefits of handing over good grain to the country and themselves at the beginning of the grain storage work, and praised the masses who handed over good grain on the spot. In order to facilitate the masses to transport grain into the warehouse, the townships also set up reception stations to specially entertain the grain-delivering masses.

    Due to the strengthening of propaganda, mobilization, and organizational work in the grain storage work, Jie County achieved the effect of short grain storage time and high quality. For example, Xiaozhangwu Natural Village, with 147 households, handed over 41,300 *jin* of grain, of which 40,200 *jin* were top-grade grain. Another example is Xiwang Township, which stored a total of 74,278 *jin*, including 59,240 *jin* of top-grade grain, 15,038 *jin* of medium-grade grain, and no inferior grain. From December 2nd to 8th, the amount of grain stored in the county accounted for more than 77.5% of the total purchase task. In order to ensure the safe storage of all grain, Jie County also sent cadres to various districts to inspect grain storage work.

    安徽省积极克服粮仓不够的困难
    山西省解县认真领导粮食入库工作
      【新华社合肥二十九日电】今年秋收以来，特别是最近期间宣传了国家过渡时期的总路线后，安徽省各地农民踊跃售粮，支援国家的工业化，安徽省粮食部门收购的粮食数量超过了以往任何一年。因此，原有的粮食仓库便不够用。安徽省粮食部门现正采取各种办法克服这一困难。芜湖、安庆、六安等专区，虽然仓库条件较好，但还缺少三、四亿斤的粮食仓库。粮食部门便积极组织调运，按时把这些地区收购的稻子调入仓库较多的城市保管。淮北地区有将近五亿斤粮食无仓可容。粮食部门首先尽量合理使用现有仓库，以改包装为散装等办法提高仓库容量。仅阜阳专区运用这一方法，就把原有仓库多装了四千七百多万斤粮食。同时各地粮食部门又在当地行政部门的协助下，租借民房或与群众签订协议（付千分之一的保管费），把粮食交给群众代为保管。阜阳专区租用民房可解决七千万斤粮食的仓库容量，宿县专区正在把一亿多斤粮食交群众保管。目前全省各地的仓容问题基本上可以解决了，各级粮食部门的职工正在积极进行清仓、消毒及翻晒粮食等工作，以防粮食霉坏。
    【本报讯】山西省解县在完成粮食收购任务后，及时认真地进行粮食入库工作。
    解县粮食收购任务已在十二月三日超额完成，并在二日就开始进行粮食入库工作。为了保证做好这一工作，中共解县县委会指示各乡，从动员群众出售余粮到做好粮食入库工作，必须始终贯彻总路线的政治教育。指示中要求全体干部不要骄傲自满、松懈麻痹，要教育群众在交粮时，晒干扬净，不搀土搀秕，做到家家交好粮。解县各乡接到指示后，认真作了布置，立即向群众展开粮食入库的宣传鼓动工作。各乡都召开了群众大会，庆祝国家收购粮食任务的胜利完成，提出百分之百完成粮食入库任务的口号。如赤社、西王、小张坞等村，在粮食入库工作开始时，说明交好粮对国家对自己的好处，并当场表扬了交好粮的群众。为了便利群众运粮入库，各乡还设立了招待站，专门招待交粮群众。
    解县由于在粮食入库工作中加强了宣传鼓动工作和组织工作，收到了粮食入库时间短和质量高的效果。如小张坞自然村一百四十七户共交粮食四万一千三百斤，有四万零二百斤都是上等粮。又如西王乡共入库七万四千二百七十八斤，内有上等粮五万九千二百四十斤，中等粮一万五千零三十八斤，下等粮则颗粒无有。全县从十二月二日开始到八日止，收购粮食的入库数量已占总收购任务数量的百分之七七点五强。为保证全部粮食安全入库，解县又派出干部到各区检查粮食保管工作。
