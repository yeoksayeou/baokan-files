    Yiliang County in Yunnan Province has educated over a thousand district and township cadres on the general line of the state's transition period. These cadres, having clarified the boundaries between the socialist and capitalist paths, have become a backbone force in educating peasants about the socialist future, leading the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement, and mobilizing peasants to sell surplus grain to the state.

    Beginning in late October, the Yiliang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened meetings for over a thousand district and township cadres. Through summarizing this year's production situation and in conjunction with arranging production tasks for this winter and next spring, they conducted specific education on the state's general line for the transition period.

    In summarizing the production process, the cadres attending the meeting, through their own personal experiences, clearly recognized the benefits of the Party and government's leadership and assistance, as well as the advantages of being organized for production. Although the natural disasters in the county this year were more severe than in previous years, thanks to the Party and government leading the peasants in resolutely fighting drought and insect plagues, and providing loans and fertilizer, the total rice yield in the county still increased compared to last year. Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams increased production even more. For example, the Zhao Pe agricultural production cooperative in the fourth district increased production by 16 percent this year, and the Yang Yinghong mutual aid team increased production by 12 percent.

    Many cadres at the meeting recalled the many benefits that peasants have received from the state's low-priced supply of industrial goods and its control of grain in the past two or three years. For example, since liberation, the prices of many industrial goods have decreased year by year. The same amount of grain can be exchanged for more cloth and salt and other industrial goods each year. During the spring plowing season this year, the state-owned grain department in some areas did not have much soybeans. Speculators and profiteers raised the market price of soybeans from 9,000 yuan to more than 30,000 yuan per liter. The state transported large quantities of soybeans, causing the price to fall back to 6,000 yuan per liter, preventing the peasants from being exploited by profiteers.

    At the meeting, everyone exposed and analyzed the current development of spontaneous capitalist forces in the countryside and its harmfulness. Party member cadres also discussed the Party member's goals in light of the eight criteria for Party members. Everyone saw that only two or three years after the completion of land reform, some people were already in debt and selling land. They further realized that taking the capitalist road would only enrich a few and impoverish the majority; only by taking the socialist road can we truly get rid of exploitation and poverty, and everyone can become prosperous. Many cadres at the meeting examined their own capitalist thoughts and behaviors. Zhang Jiaqing, deputy head of the second district, after self-criticism, returned the grain he had bought at low prices by "buying green" to the original owner and apologized to him. Zhang Zhengfa, director of the cooperative in the third district, also sold sixteen dan of grain that he had hoarded at low prices to the state. At the county's enlarged cadre meeting, the attending cadres proposed to continue resisting disasters this winter, strive to increase wheat production by 30 percent next spring, actively strengthen the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and actively carry out winter production to lay the foundation for expanding production next year.

    On the basis of increased cadre awareness and high production enthusiasm, the meeting combined the education on increasing production and practicing economy to explain that selling surplus grain to the state to support national construction is the duty of rural cadres and peasants. At the same time, it explained the benefits of selling grain and expanding reproduction. Cadres expressed that they would actively take the lead in selling grain and expanding production. Cadres and members of the county's two agricultural production cooperatives voluntarily sold this year's surplus grain to the state.

    After returning home, the cadres first publicized to their families and helped their families formulate plans for selling grain and expanding production. Many elderly peasants originally had the idea that "piling up gold is not as good as storing grain." With the help and mobilization of their children, they also agreed to sell their surplus grain to the state. Many cadres also first criticized their own mistakes at family meetings to enlighten others. Zhang Jiaqing, deputy head of the second district, had a wife who was initially unwilling to sell grain. Zhang Jiaqing criticized his past mistakes of hoarding grain at the family meeting, which raised his wife's political awareness. As a result, she agreed to sell the surplus grain to the state.

    After holding family meetings, many cadres widely conveyed the state's general line to the masses through various mass organizations. Agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams also took the lead in formulating grain sales plans.

    Thanks to the backbone role played by more than a thousand district and township cadres in Yiliang County, the propaganda of the general line has been widely launched among the peasants in the county, and the amount of surplus grain sold by the peasants is increasing day by day. The county's daily grain purchase volume has increased from about 250,000 jin in October to about 850,000 jin recently.

    宜良县向广大干部具体进行总路线教育
    千余区乡干部成为动员农民卖粮的骨干
    云南省宜良县一千多区乡干部经过认真学习了国家过渡时期的总路线，划清了社会主义道路和资本主义道路的界限，已成为一批向农民进行社会主义前途教育，领导农业互助合作运动和动员农民把余粮卖给国家的骨干。
    中共宜良县委会从十月底开始，分别召开了一千多人的区乡干部会议，通过总结今年的生产情况，结合布置今冬明春的生产任务具体进行了国家过渡时期总路线的教育。
    在总结生产过程中，到会干部通过自己的切身体验，明确认识了党和政府的领导、帮助，以及组织起来进行生产的好处。该县今年的自然灾害虽比历年严重，由于党和政府领导农民坚决和旱灾、虫灾斗争，并发放贷款，供给肥料等，全县稻谷产量仍比去年增加。农业生产合作社和互助组增产更多。如第四区段朝培农业生产合作社今年增产百分之十六，杨应鸿互助组增产百分之十二。
    许多干部在会议上回忆了最近两三年来国家廉价供应农民大批工业品和掌握粮食使农民得到的许多好处。如解放以来，许多工业品价格逐年降低，用同样粮食，能换得一年比一年多的布匹和食盐等工业品。今年春耕时，有的地区国营粮食部门掌握黄豆不多，投机奸商把黄豆市价每升由九千元抬高到三万多元，国家运来大量黄豆，使豆价回落到每升六千元，农民们没有遭受奸商的剥削。
    在会议上，大家揭发、分析了当前农村资本主义自发势力的发展情况及其危害性。党员干部还联系党员标准的八个条件，讨论了党员的奋斗目标。大家看到土地改革完成还不过两、三年，就已有人负债、出卖土地等事实，进一步认识到走资本主义道路只会使少数人富裕，多数人贫困破产；走社会主义道路，才能真正摆脱剥削和贫困，人人都富裕。许多干部在会上检讨了自己的资本主义思想和行为。第二区副区长张家清检讨后，将“买青”低价套购的谷子退还了原主，并向原主道歉。第三区合作社理事张正发也将自己压价囤购的十六石谷子转卖给国家。在全县扩大干部会议上，到会干部提出今冬要继续抵抗灾害，争取明春小麦增产百分之三十，并积极加强互助合作运动，积极进行冬季生产，为明年扩大生产打基础。
    在干部觉悟提高，生产情绪高涨的基础上，会议结合增产节约教育，说明向国家出售余粮，支援国家建设是农村干部和农民的义务，同时说明了卖出粮食，扩大再生产的好处。干部纷纷表示回去要积极带头卖粮，扩大生产。全县两个农业生产合作社的干部和社员，自愿将今年的余粮卖给国家。
      干部们回家以后，首先向家属宣传，并帮助家庭订出卖粮和扩大生产的计划。许多老年农民原来有“堆金不如积谷”的思想，经过自己子女的帮助、动员，也同意把余粮卖给国家。许多干部在家庭会议上还首先检讨自己的错误来启发别人。第二区副区长张家清的妻子开始不肯卖粮。张家清在开家庭会议时，批判了自己过去囤粮的错误，提高了他妻子的政治觉悟，结果她同意把余粮卖给国家。
    许多干部开好家庭会议以后，通过各种群众组织，向群众广泛进行了国家总路线的传达。农业生产合作社和互助组也都带头订了卖粮计划。
    宜良县由于一千多区乡干部发挥了骨干作用，总路线的宣传已在全县农民中普遍展开，农民出售余粮的数量日益增多。全县每天购粮数量，已由十月份的二十五万斤左右，增加为最近的八十五万斤左右。
