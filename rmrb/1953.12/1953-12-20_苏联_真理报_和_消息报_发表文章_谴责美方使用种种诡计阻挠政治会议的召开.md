Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 19th: TASS, Moscow, December 18th: V. Korionov published an article in "Pravda" commenting on the conspiracies of those who oppose the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. He said: Recent news from Korea is bound to cause concern to all those who are striving to ease international tensions. On December 12, the American representative, Dean, walked out of the meeting room in Panmunjom, thus interrupting the bilateral talks on the issue of the Korean political conference.

Regarding the means adopted by the U.S. side in the talks that began on October 26, Korionov said: It is now quite clear that from the first day of the talks, the U.S. side did not intend to reach an agreement on convening a Korean political conference. The U.S. delegation obviously used various tricks to obstruct the talks. They did so because some Americans want to "resolve" the Korean issue in such a way as to allow them to use Korea as a bridgehead for attacking other countries and peoples in the future.

The Korean political conference can only promote the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue if it is convened on the basis of equality between the two sides that signed the armistice agreement. The decisions of the conference must be adopted unanimously by both sides and must be binding on all signatory countries. The realization of peace in Korea and the resolution of the Korean issue will greatly help to ease international tensions. Therefore, all peoples, especially those in Asia and the Far East, are very hopeful that the conference will proceed smoothly. On the other hand, the experience of the long-delayed Panmunjom armistice talks tells us that if the political conference is to proceed smoothly, representatives from neutral countries such as India and the Soviet Union, who have contributed greatly to the realization of the Korean armistice, must participate.

This is the position of the Korean-Chinese side in the Panmunjom talks. On November 30, they put forward a comprehensive proposal on all items on the agenda, which provided a basis for the effective conduct of the conference. However, instead of studying the Korean-Chinese proposal with a serious attitude, the U.S. representative attempted to force the other party to accept their proposal, arbitrarily saying that their proposal was "final," but their proposal violated the basic principles of a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

The author cited many examples to illustrate that the U.S. delegation did not want the Korean political conference to be convened and proceed smoothly as soon as possible. He said: From this, it is very clear who should be held responsible for the current situation in Korea, especially for the interruption of the Panmunjom talks.

"Izvestia" also published a commentary on this issue by F. Kudryavtsev. He commented on the U.S. attitude, saying: If the U.S. side truly wanted to convene the political conference as soon as possible, it would not deliberately delay the Panmunjom talks. The situation at the time of Dean's interruption of the talks was created entirely by the U.S. side, because the positions taken by the American representatives in Panmunjom and New York all proved that they deliberately interrupted the talks for a predetermined purpose. If the U.S. representative does not return to Panmunjom to continue the talks, the U.S. must bear full responsibility for the interruption of the talks.

### 苏联“真理报”和“消息报”发表文章  谴责美方使用种种诡计阻挠政治会议的召开

    苏联“真理报”和“消息报”发表文章
    谴责美方使用种种诡计阻挠政治会议的召开
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十八日讯：维·科里奥诺夫在“真理报”上发表文章，评论反对和平解决朝鲜问题的人们的阴谋。他说：最近来自朝鲜的消息，必然会引起所有争取缓和国际紧张局势的人们的忧虑。十二月十二日，在板门店的美国代表迪安走出了会议室，从而中断了关于朝鲜政治会议问题的双方会谈。
    科里奥诺夫在谈到美方在十月二十六日开始的会谈中采取的手段时说：现在已经十分明显，从会谈的第一天起，美方就不打算就召开朝鲜政治会议达成协议。美国代表团明显地使用了种种诡计来阻挠会谈。他们所以这样做，是因为某些美国人士想使朝鲜问题按这样的方式来“解决”，就是要使他们今后能够把朝鲜当作进攻其他国家和人民的桥头堡。
    朝鲜政治会议只有在停战协定签字双方对等的基础上召开，才能促进朝鲜问题的和平解决。会议的决议必须由双方一致通过，并且必须对所有的签字国具有约束力。朝鲜和平的实现和朝鲜问题的解决，将大大有助于缓和国际紧张局势。所以，所有的人民，尤其是亚洲和远东各国的人民，都非常希望会议得以顺利进行。另一方面，拖延很久的板门店停战谈判的经验又告诉大家，如果要政治会议顺利进行，必须有在实现朝鲜停战方面出了很大力量的印度和苏联这样一些中立国家的代表参加。
    这就是朝中方面在板门店会谈中的立场。十一月三十日，他们就议程上的所有项目提出了一个全面建议，这为会议的有效进行提供了基础。但是，美国代表不但不以严肃的态度来研究朝中方面的建议，反而企图强使对方接受他们的建议，专横地说他们的建议是“最后的”，但是他们的建议是违反了和平解决朝鲜问题的基本原则的。
    作者引用了许多例子，说明美国代表团不希望朝鲜政治会议早日召开并顺利进行，他说：由此看来，造成朝鲜目前的局势、特别是中断板门店会谈的责任应由谁负，就十分明显了。
    “消息报”也发表了弗·库德里雅夫采夫关于这个问题的评论。他评论美国的态度说：如果美方真正愿意早日召开政治会议，它就不会故意拖延板门店会谈了。迪安中断会谈时的形势是美方一手造成的，因为板门店和纽约的美国代表人物所采取的立场，都证明了他们是为了预定的目的而蓄意中断会谈的。如果美方代表不回到板门店继续进行会谈，美国就必须对会谈的中断负全部责任。
