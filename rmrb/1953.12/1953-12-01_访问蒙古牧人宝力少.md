Visiting Mongolian Herdsman Baolishao

Our Correspondent Li Yi

How do Mongolian herdsmen living in the Hulunbuir region of Inner Mongolia understand the campaign for increased production and thrift called for by the Party and the government? What have they already done to respond to the campaign, and what are they planning to do? To understand the situation of herdsmen's increased production and thrift, the reporter visited Baolishao, a herdsman near Wugunor, and his flock on November 7. It was a day of wind and snow, and before me was a flock of more than 2,200 sheep. The herdsman Baolishao clearly knew the overall situation of his flock, just as he could distinguish his own sheep by looking at their characteristics. Baolishao said that it should be frankly admitted that the sheep's fatness this year is worse than in previous years. In the past, during the autumn fattening period, ordinary sheep could gain about half a jin of fat per day, but this year it is only one or two liang at most. The reason is that there was more rain this summer and autumn, and the quality of the grass was poor. During the entire fattening period, the sheep did not get a good supply of wild onions and some more nutritious grass. In previous years, wild onions could be eaten for a month, but this year it was only ten days. This year, in the pastures where wild onions grow, nature seemed to deliberately make things difficult, and the tall, awn-bearing needle grass covered the wild onions, making it difficult for the sheep to eat. Baolishao said with a tone of reproach: "The grass situation this year is really bad!" However, I could not see any pessimism or disappointment in his emotions. He firmly believed that, in order to increase wealth, the important thing in the future is to actively strive for improvement in feeding and management, and to maintain the existing fatness of the sheep. In fact, based on his decades of grazing experience, he has already taken the following remedial measures in his flock: First, under the government's unified allocation of pastures, he carefully selected some good pastures for the sheep, and every time he drove the sheep forward, he first scraped the snow with his feet to see what kind of grass it was and what its quality was. Second, he implemented slow herding. He tried to let the sheep run less and eat more grass in one pasture because the daylight here is shorter than in Guannei. Third, he diligently fed them salt water. Baolishao said, "Salt water is like oil." He treated his sheep with such care. Fourth, he brought them back to the pen before sunset, because it would lose fat if the pen was cold late in the day. Baolishao was full of confidence that if he continued to do so, without major natural disasters, the sheep's fatness could not only be maintained but also increased to varying degrees. In fact, according to the results of recent key measurements, the weight of many sheep has increased, but the speed is not as fast as in previous years. Regarding the increase in production and thrift called for by the Party and the government, although Baolishao could not explain too much, he clearly knew the importance of his own work. He described his work mood like this: "I think about it all day long: The Communist Party and Chairman Mao are calling on us herdsmen to increase production and thrift. I want my flock to have as many fat sheep as possible and as few thin sheep as possible, by all means. Every day, when I drive the flock back to the pen, if I see that some sheep have not gained fat, I immediately think: This may be because I didn't graze well enough, drove them too fast, and they ate too little grass! Good! I should pay more attention to grazing tomorrow."

    访问蒙古牧人宝力少
    本报记者  李翼
    居住在内蒙古呼伦贝尔地方的蒙古族牧人们，是怎样理解党和政府所号召的增产节约运动？他们为着响应增产节约运动，已经做到了一些什么？还准备怎样做？为着了解牧人们增产节约的情况，记者于十一月七日访问了乌固诺尔附近的一个牧人宝力少和他的羊群。这是一个风雪交加的日子，展开在我眼前的，是一个二千二百多只的羊群。牧羊人宝力少清楚地知道本羊群的全盘情况，一如他只要看看羊的特征就能分辨出是自己的羊一样。宝力少说，应该坦白承认，今年羊的膘水是要比往年差一些的，在往年秋末抓膘时期，普通羊每日可上膘半斤左右，今年最多就只有一、二两。原因是今年夏秋雨多，草的质量坏，在整个抓膘期间，羊没有很好的吃到野葱和一些养分较大的草。在往年，野葱可吃一个月，今年却只有十天。今年在长野葱的草场上，大自然好像故意与人为难，长得很高而且带芒刺的狼针草，把野葱遮得叫羊难以下嘴。宝力少带着一种责备的口吻说：“今年草的情况真是够坏的！”可是，我在他的情绪里，却看不到任何一点儿悲观失望。他坚决地认为，为了增产财富，今后重要的是要积极地从饲养和管理上努力求得改进，保养住羊的已有膘水。实际上呢，他根据他几十年的放牧经验，在他的羊群里已经采取了下列的补救办法：第一，在政府统一调配牧场的情况下，自己认真地给羊选择了一些好草场，每逢赶羊前进的时候，先用脚扒扒积雪，看看是什么草，质量怎样。第二，实行了慢赶羊。尽可能地让羊少跑，在一块草场上多吃一些草。因为这里的白昼较关内是要短的。第三，勤喂咸水。宝力少说：“咸水就好像是油。”他这样亲切地体贴着他的羊。第四，趁太阳不落回圈。因为天迟圈冷了就要掉膘。宝力少满怀信心的认为，继续这样做下去，如果没有大的自然灾害，羊的膘水不但可以保住，而且还会在不同的程度上有所增加。实际上，根据最近几天重点衡量的结果，不少羊的体重是增加了，只是速度不比往年快。关于党和政府所号召的增产节约，宝力少虽然讲不上什么太多的道理来，可是，他却清楚地知道他本身工作的重要性。他这样叙述了自己的工作心情：“我成天这样想：共产党、毛主席号召我们牧民们增产节约哩。我就想叫我的羊群，用尽一切办法，多有几个肥羊，少有几个掉膘的。每天，当我赶着羊群回圈的时候，如果看到了几个羊不见增加膘，我就马上想到了：这可能是因为我放的还不够好，赶的太快，吃的草少，好！我明天就应该更加注意放牧。”
