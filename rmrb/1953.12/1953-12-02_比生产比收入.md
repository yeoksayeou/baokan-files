	Comparing Production and Comparing Income
	Summarizing production and using actual examples of mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives increasing yields and income to illustrate the superiority of organizing is an effective way to attract farmers to actively participate in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. The practice of Xujiagou Village, District One, Anyang County, reported by the Henan Daily on November 9, powerfully proves this point.
	According to the Henan Daily report, after this year's autumn harvest, the Xujiagou Village Branch of the Chinese Communist Party, in order to mobilize farmers to do a good job in winter production and increase their enthusiasm for organizing, led the village farmers in conducting a production summary. Under the call of the Party branch, various types of farmers throughout the village widely engaged in yield comparisons, identifying the reasons for increased production through concrete comparisons. The report introduced many vivid examples such as "three different productions and three different harvests on one piece of land." For example, in the west of the village, there was a ridge of land divided among the families of Xu Jiaren, Dong Shiyou, and Xu Jiazhen during the land reform. This year, the three plots of land of these three families were all wheat stubble fields, and they all planted millet with the same seeds on the same day. However, the harvests were very different: Xu Jiaren harvested 320 catties per mu, Dong Shiyou harvested 186 catties per mu, and Xu Jiazhen only harvested 150 catties per mu. Why were there three different harvests on the same piece of land? In addition to the different farming management methods, it was also because the production conditions of the three people were different. Xu Jiaren participated in the agricultural production cooperative. Because the cooperative uniformly allocated labor, giving play to each person's strengths; uniformly managed the land, achieving planting according to the land conditions, and adopted new farming methods; and implemented piecework recording and flexible distribution based on fixed quotas, increasing the enthusiasm of the members, the harvest of Xu Jiaren's plot of land, although it was a very ordinary plot of land cultivated by the cooperative this year, was much higher than that of individual farmers. Dong Shiyou joined a year-round mutual aid team. There are nine such mutual aid teams in Xujiagou Village. Because the mutual aid teams can rationally allocate labor, improve labor efficiency, implement land processing, and improve farming techniques, the harvest of each team is higher than last year, but not as good as that of the agricultural production cooperative. Xu Jiazhen, however, had been working independently. Although he worked very hard and launched an "undeclared war" with the agricultural production cooperative, he ultimately suffered from insufficient labor. This year, when seizing the opportunity to plant when the soil was moist, his family alone could not handle it, and coupled with conservative thinking and backward farming techniques, the yield on the same plot of land was neither as good as that of mutual aid team member Dong Shiyou nor as good as that of agricultural production cooperative member Xu Jiaren. The report also introduced comparisons of the harvests of the same farmer before and after joining a mutual aid team, as well as comparisons of the harvests of individual farmers with those of farmers in the same conditions who joined the agricultural production cooperative. For example, Xu Qin only harvested three *shi* of millet from four *mu* of land last year when she did not participate in the mutual aid team; this year, after joining the mutual aid team and relying on mutual assistance, she harvested four *shi* and six *dou* from the same plot of land, and also hired five fewer short-term laborers. Another example is Xu Jinhua's family, which has four male and female laborers and seventeen *mu* of land, harvested nine *shi* of millet this year and is expected to harvest 900 *jin* of cotton; while agricultural production cooperative members in similar conditions can distribute twenty *shi* of millet and 2,000 *jin* of cotton. From these comparisons, farmers not only clearly see that participating in mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives can indeed produce more grain and increase income; they also understand that mutual aid teams are better than individual farming, and agricultural production cooperatives are better than mutual aid teams.
	The report said that after comparing harvests and summarizing production, the ranks of those organized in Xujiagou Village are growing. The prestige of the agricultural production cooperative has greatly increased; the nine year-round mutual aid teams have become more consolidated, and two temporary mutual aid teams have been converted into year-round mutual aid teams; in addition, eight new temporary mutual aid teams have been established. Currently, this large army of labor and production, under the leadership of the Party branch, is advancing along the road pointed out by the village's democratically discussed winter patriotic production increase and conservation plan.
	The Henan Daily correctly assessed the significance of the Xujiagou Village Party branch's practice. In the editor's note, the newspaper emphasized that the experience of Xujiagou Village in summarizing production proves that typical demonstrations are the most effective method of educating farmers. In inspiring farmers to improve and refine farming techniques, it is necessary to use the methods of "typical demonstration," "local materials, and local promotion"; in guiding farmers to participate in mutual aid and cooperation, it is equally necessary to use the methods of "typical demonstration," "local materials, and local promotion."

### 比生产比收入

    比生产比收入
    通过总结生产，以互助组、农业生产合作社提高产量，增加收入的实际事例，来说明组织起来的优越性，是吸引农民积极参加互助合作运动的有效方法。河南日报十一月九日报道的安阳县一区许家沟村的作法，有力地证明了这一点。
    据河南日报报道，今年秋收后，中共许家沟村支部为动员农民搞好冬季生产和提高农民组织起来的热情，领导全村农民进行了一次生产总结。在党支部的号召下，全村各种不同的农户广泛地展开了收成比较，通过具体比较找出提高生产的原因。报道中介绍了“一块地三样生产三样收成”等许多生动事例。如该村村西有一块岗岭地，土地改革时分给了许贾仁、董士友、许贾珍三家。今年这三家的三块地都是麦茬地，种的都是谷子，又是同一天下的种。但收成却大不相同：许贾仁每亩收三百二十斤，董士友每亩收一百八十六斤，而许贾珍每亩只收到一百五十斤。为什么同样一块地却有三样收成？除了耕作管理方法有所不同外，还因为三个人的生产条件不同。许贾仁参加了农业生产合作社。由于合作社统一调配劳动力，发挥了各人的长处；统一经营土地，做到因地种植，采用了新耕作法；又实行按件记工和死分活记，提高了社员的劳动积极性，因而社员许贾仁的那块地虽是社里今年耕作的很平常的一块地，却得到了远较单干户为高的收获量。董士友则加入了常年互助组，这样的互助组在许家沟村共有九个。由于互助组能够合理调配劳动力，提高劳动效率，实行土地加工和改进耕作技术，每个组的收成都比去年多，可是都比不上农业生产合作社。许贾珍却一直单干着。虽然他很辛勤地劳动，并和农业生产合作社来了个“不宣而战”，但终因劳动力不足，今年趁墒抢种时独自家忙不过来，再加上思想保守，耕作技术落后，因此同样一块地，产量既赶不上互助组组员董士友，更赶不上农业生产合作社社员许贾仁。报道中还介绍了同一个农户以加入互助组前和加入互助组后的收成进行对比，以及单干农民和加入农业生产合作社而与自己条件相同的农户进行收成比较等情况。如许琴只去年未参加互助组时，四亩地只打了三石谷子；今年加入了互助组，依靠互助，同是那一块地，却收了四石六斗，还少雇了五个短工。又如许金华家有男女劳动力四个，十七亩地，今年收了九石谷，预计能收九百斤棉花；而像他这样条件的农业生产合作社社员却能分二十石谷，两千斤棉花。从这些对比中，农民不仅清楚地看到参加互助组和农业生产合作社确实能多打粮食，增加收入；同时也明白了互助组比单干强、农业生产合作社又比互助组强的原因。
    报道中说，许家沟村经过比收成、总结生产，组织起来的队伍日益壮大。农业生产合作社的威信大为提高；九个常年互助组更加巩固，两个临时性互助组转为常年互助组；另外，还新成立了八个临时性互助组。目前这一支劳动生产大军，正在党支部领导下，沿着全村民主讨论的冬季爱国增产节约计划所指出的大道迈进。
    河南日报正确地估计了许家沟村党支部作法的意义。报纸在编者按语中着重指出：许家沟村总结生产的经验证明了典型示范是教育农民最有效的方法。在启发农民提高和改进耕作技术方面，需要用
  “典型示范”、“就地取材，就地推广”的方法；在引导农民参加互助合作方面，同样需要运用“典型示范”、“就地取材，就地推广”的方法。
