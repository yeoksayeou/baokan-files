So-Called "Refusal to Repatriate"
　　Pei Guoxun Yao Shantang

The American aggressors, in order to forcibly detain prisoners of war, resorted to violence to prevent the prisoners of war from truly expressing their will to return to their motherland, while American generals shamelessly claimed this was the prisoners of war "refusing repatriation"! Not long ago, reporters interviewed Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who had been repatriated, and they exposed with anger the bloody crimes committed by the US side in the Busan Second Prisoner of War Camp more than a year ago, using appalling means such as starvation and slaughter to detain our captured personnel. This irrefutable fact completely exposes the shameless lie of the US side's so-called "refusal to repatriate."

On April 15th and 16th, 1952, the Busan US military prisoner of war camp management authorities notified the Korean and Chinese sick and wounded prisoners of war detained in the first, second, and third sick and wounded prisoner of war camps, respectively, through verbal, written, and broadcast announcements, falsely claiming to have obtained the "agreement" of our side's truce negotiation representatives in Panmunjom to conduct "screening" among the prisoners of war. This conspiracy by the US side to detain prisoners of war was quickly seen through by our captured personnel. They stated: We all want to return to our motherland! And signed petitions one after another, refusing to accept the illegal "screening." Representatives of our captured personnel from the three sick and wounded prisoner of war camps submitted protest letters to the Busan US military prisoner of war camp supervisor. However, the US military prisoner of war camp supervisor not only did not accept the legitimate demands of our captured personnel but instead ordered US military police to erect "screening" tents, attempting to forcibly and illegally "screen" the prisoners of war.

Our captured personnel opposed this behavior by the US side and demolished the so-called "screening" tents several times. In order to express their will to insist on repatriation, they tried every means to use discarded flour sacks, tarpaulins, etc., to make the national flags of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. On April 15th, magnificent and splendid national flags were raised successively in the camps of the first, second, and third sick and wounded prisoner of war camps. The heinous US military prisoner of war camp management authorities brutally and violently harmed our captured personnel, and on April 15th, directed the Syngman Rhee bandit army to open fire and injure two of our captured personnel in the first sick and wounded prisoner of war camp who were defending the national flag; on April 16th, they dispatched a large number of armed forces and tanks to surround the sick and wounded prisoner of war camps. A group of fully armed US troops entered the third sick and wounded prisoner of war camp, killing our captured personnel Zhang Shiji and seizing the national flag. But all these brutal acts by the US side could not stop our captured personnel's determination to return to their motherland. They made hundreds of red flags and hung them up in the heavily guarded camps.

After the US military prisoner of war camp management authorities' various means of deception and intimidation suffered a shameful failure, they began to persecute our captured personnel with even more brutal means. From April 16th, the US side stopped treating our sick and wounded personnel in the first, second, and third sick and wounded prisoner of war camps; on May 11th, they issued a final "ultimatum," saying "If you do not accept 'screening,' we will cut off food and water supplies!" The extremely vicious enemy indeed adopted this means of strangling our captured personnel. From May 11th, the US military cut off the food and water supply to the first, second, and third sick and wounded prisoner of war camps. During this period, the conditions of many sick and wounded prisoners of war became more serious, with wounds festering, ulcerating, and becoming maggot-infested, a horrific sight; coupled with the cruel torment of hunger, their health was severely damaged. When our captured personnel were unbearably hungry, they used grass roots, leaves, and tree bark from the camp to fill their stomachs. The sick and wounded personnel in the first sick and wounded prisoner of war camp even boiled broken leather shoes and broken leather belts to fill their stomachs. They were so hungry that their eyes turned black, saliva dripped from their mouths and noses, their hearts raced, their legs weakened, and they fainted to the ground. Korean People's Army prisoners of war Park Sang-mu and others were starved to death! Although the sick and wounded personnel in the second and third camps were secretly supported by prisoners of war in the neighboring fourth and sixth sick and wounded prisoner of war camps who were enduring hunger and saving food, more than 500 prisoners of war in the third camp were still too hungry to move! Even so, our captured personnel's will to insist on total repatriation did not waver in the slightest. Anti-"screening" songs and slogans rose one after another. Seriously wounded prisoner of war Yang Changjun, who was blind, had fallen to the ground from hunger, but he still shouted in a hoarse voice: "Comrades, if I die, please take my name back to the motherland!" While the sick and wounded personnel were in a terrible state of starvation, the despicable and shameless US military prisoner of war camp management authorities actually carried cooked rice outside the barbed wire fence to lure our captured personnel, saying: "Whoever accepts 'screening' will have food to eat!" Our captured personnel, who were on their last breath from hunger, comforted each other, glared at the enemy, suppressed the pain of hunger, and shouted at the brutal enemy: "Hunger cannot scare us!"

When these conspiratorial means of the US military prisoner of war camp management authorities were declared bankrupt, they resorted to a massacre of appalling cruelty. At more than seven o'clock in the morning on May 21st, when our captured personnel in the third sick and wounded prisoner of war camp were sharing the food supported by our captured personnel in the sixth sick and wounded prisoner of war camp, the loudspeaker set up by the US military outside the camp suddenly roared, ordering our captured personnel to gather at the gate within fifteen minutes to accept "screening," otherwise they would be armed "suppressed"! At the same time, a US military lieutenant colonel, two majors, leading two companies of fully armed US troops and a battalion of the Syngman Rhee bandit army, and driving eight tanks and five armored vehicles, surrounded the prisoner of war camp, a part of which rushed towards the third sick and wounded prisoner of war camp. Seeing that not a single prisoner of war went to the gate to accept its illegal "screening," the US military officers immediately directed a group of US troops to rush into the third sick and wounded prisoner of war camp, which held more than 1,300 of our captured personnel, and released poison gas bombs. Under the attack of the poison gas, our captured personnel shed tears and vomited, spitting yellow water. Although they covered their mouths and noses with rags and tattered towels, they still could not stop the attack of the poison gas! At this time, another group of enemy troops rushed into the camp and threw grenades and opened fire on the unarmed prisoners of war. Our captured personnel could no longer bear it, and waved crutches and picked up stones to defend themselves. The enemy's forces became more and more numerous, and they fired fiercely with 60mm mortars, light and heavy machine guns, and other weapons. In an instant, poison gas filled the entire third sick and wounded prisoner of war camp, and the sound of gunfire shook the entire city of Busan. All of our captured personnel were poisoned, and many were shot dead in pools of blood. The old people in the Busan urban area, standing on the high ground outside the barbed wire, also covered their faces and wept towards the prisoner of war camp. This massacre of appalling cruelty did not stop until about ten o'clock. More than 190 of our captured personnel, including Yang Tinghua and Yu Shaoquan, were shot dead or wounded, and another 20 died after being taken to the prisoner of war hospital due to severe poisoning and injuries! The next day, the heinous enemy again threw a large number of poison gas bombs into the second sick and wounded prisoner of war camp, and more than 1,800 of our captured personnel were all poisoned. More than 270 people, including Wang Shaozhong and Chen Yun, were severely poisoned, and three people, including Long Pinliang, died on the spot. The American generals, who were constantly talking about "humanitarianism" and "respecting" the prisoners of war's "individual freedom," used this inhumane massacre to force the prisoners of war to accept "screening."

After the massacre, fully armed US troops transported our captured personnel from the third and second camps one after another in trucks to the tenth camp in the afternoon of the 21st and 22nd. On the way, a bright national flag suddenly appeared on the truck, and the truck echoed with loud songs and the slogan "Resolutely demand total repatriation." Although the enemy used various threats, beatings, and repeated stops for "inspection," it was all in vain. On the afternoons of May 21st and 22nd, US military officers forcibly and illegally "screened" our captured personnel from the third and second sick and wounded prisoner of war camps who had been escorted to the tenth camp. During the "screening," US military officers, Kuomintang remnant bandit secret agents from Taiwan, and Syngman Rhee bandit army officers used violence to force our captured personnel, who had suffered all kinds of torture, to stand with their backs to the door, not allowing them to look back, and announced: There are two roads behind you, those who want to return to the mainland and North Korea, turn right at the door; those who want to go to Taiwan and "Republic of Korea," walk straight ahead... They attempted to deceive our captured personnel into taking the "road to Taiwan and South Korea." At the same time, they also deployed fully armed US troops and Rhee puppet soldiers on both sides of the road, using all kinds of intimidation and beatings against our captured personnel to destroy their determination to return to their country. When our captured personnel ran towards the road back to their country, regardless of the US military's bayonets and the secret agents' clubs, the US military officers and secret agents shamelessly dragged them away with violence. The US military officers and secret agents used this despicable means to detain many Chinese People's Volunteer Army and Korean People's Army captured personnel who were detained in various camps in the Busan prisoner of war camp. The detained personnel struggled desperately while shouting: "Oppose the US imperialists' detention of prisoners of war!" "Resolutely return to the motherland!" The brutal US military officers locked them up but shamelessly claimed that they had "refused repatriation"!

The facts revealed by the above-mentioned returnees can be seen that the American aggressors used inhumane means such as starvation and massacre to forcibly detain our captured personnel. What the American generals said about the prisoners of war "refusing repatriation" is nothing but a complete lie.

    如此“拒绝遣返”
    裴国勋  姚善堂
    美国侵略者为强迫扣留战俘，采取暴力迫使战俘不能真正表达他们愿回祖国的意志，而美国将军们却无耻地说这是战俘“拒绝遣返”！不久前，记者访问了已遣返回国的中国人民志愿军被俘人员，他们以愤怒的心情，揭发了一年多以前美方在釜山第二战俘营，施用饥饿、屠杀等骇人听闻的手段扣留我方被俘人员的血腥罪行。这一不可辩驳的事实，完全揭穿了美方所谓“拒绝遣返”的无耻谎言。
    一九五二年四月十五、十六两日，釜山美军战俘营管理当局，分别以口头、书面和播音器通知拘留在第一、二、三病伤战俘收容所的朝、中病伤被俘人员，谎称已获得板门店我方停战谈判代表的
  “同意”，要在战俘中进行“甄别”。美方这一扣留战俘的阴谋，很快即为我方被俘人员所识破。他们提出：我们都要回祖国！并纷纷签名，拒绝接受非法“甄别”。三个病伤战俘收容所的我方被俘人员代表，分别把抗议书送给釜山美军战俘营总管。但美军战俘营总管，不仅未接受我方被俘人员的正当要求，反令美军宪兵搭起“甄别”帐篷，企图对战俘强行非法“甄别”。
    我方被俘人员反对美方此种行为，曾数次拆毁所谓“甄别”帐篷，他们并为了表达坚持遣返的意志，想尽一切办法，利用美军遗弃的面袋、油布等，制成中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的国旗。四月十五日，鲜艳壮丽的国旗，先后在第一、第二、第三病伤战俘收容所的营场中升起。万恶的美军战俘营管理当局，竟蛮横地以暴力摧残我方被俘人员，于四月十五日指使李承晚匪军开枪打伤了第一病伤战俘收容所的两个捍卫国旗的我方被俘人员；四月十六日，更派出大批武装部队和坦克，包围了病伤战俘收容所。一批全副武装的美军进入第三病伤战俘收容所内，打死我方被俘人员章士基，并抢走国旗。但美方所有这些残暴行为，都阻挡不了我方被俘人员坚持回祖国的决心。他们制好成百面红旗，在美军警备森严的营场内悬挂起来。
    美军战俘营管理当局的欺骗和威吓的种种手段遭到可耻的失败后，开始以更残暴的手段迫害我方被俘人员。从四月十六日起，美方停止了对第一、二、三病伤战俘收容所的我方被俘病伤人员的治疗；五月十一日更下了最后“通牒”，说什么“如不接受‘甄别’，就断绝粮水供应！”穷凶极恶的敌人果然采取了这种扼杀我方被俘人员的手段。五月十一日起，美军断绝了对第一、第二、第三病伤战俘收容所的粮水供应。在此期间，很多病伤战俘的病伤情况更加严重，伤口化脓、溃烂、生蛆，惨不忍睹；再加上残酷的饥饿折磨，严重地损害了他们的健康。我方被俘人员在饥饿难熬的时候，就以营场内的草根、树叶，树皮来充饥，第一病伤战俘收容所的病伤人员甚至煮破皮鞋、破皮带充饥。他们饿得眼睛发黑、口鼻淌清水、心慌腿软、晕倒在地。朝鲜人民军被俘人员朴相务等两人，就这样被活活饿死！二所、三所的病伤人员，虽有邻近的第四、第六病伤战俘收容所的战俘忍饥节粮偷偷支援，但三所仍有五百多名战俘饿得不能动弹！即便这样，我方被俘人员坚持要求全部遣返的意志并没有丝毫动摇。反“甄别”的歌声、口号声，此起彼伏。双目失明的重伤战俘杨昌俊已饿倒在地，但他还用喑哑的声音喊道：“同志们，我如果死了，请把我的名字带回祖国去！”在病伤人员陷入可怕的饥饿状态中时，卑鄙无耻的美军战俘营管理当局，竟将煮好的饭抬到铁丝网外，引诱我方被俘人员，说：“谁接受‘甄别’，谁就有饭吃！”饿得奄奄一息的我方被俘人员，互相安慰，怒目睽视着敌人，压抑着饥饿的痛苦，他们向残暴的敌人喊道：“饥饿吓不倒我们！”
    当美军战俘营管理当局的这些阴谋手段宣告破产后，就采取了惨绝人寰的大屠杀。五月二十一日早上七点多钟，第三病伤战俘收容所的我方被俘人员正在分食第六病伤战俘收容所我方被俘人员支援的饭食时，美军设置在营场外的广播器突然嘶叫起来，命令我方被俘人员在十五分钟内到门口集合，接受“甄别”，如不服从，就要武装“镇压”！同时，美军战俘营一个中校、两个少校，带领全副武装的美军两个连、李承晚匪军一个营，并开出八辆坦克、五辆装甲车，将战俘营包围，其中一部冲向第三病伤战俘收容所。美军军官们见无一个战俘到门口接受其非法“甄别”，即立即指挥一批美军冲入拘有一千三百多名我方被俘人员的第三病伤战俘收容所，施放毒气弹。我方被俘人员在毒气的侵袭下，流泪发呕，口吐黄水，虽用破布片、烂手巾蒙住口鼻，却仍然阻挡不住毒气的侵袭！此时，又有一批敌军冲进营场，竟向手无寸铁的战俘投掷手榴弹和开枪射击。我被俘人员忍无可忍，挥起拐杖、拣起石头来自卫。敌人的兵力愈来愈多，他们用六○炮、轻重机枪等武器猛烈射击。一刹时，毒气弥漫了整个第三病伤战俘收容所，枪炮声震动了整个釜山。我方被俘人员全部中毒，并有许多人被打死在血泊里。站在铁丝网外高处的釜山市区老百姓，也向着战俘营场掩面流泪。这一惨绝人寰的大屠杀，直至十时许始停止。我被俘人员杨廷华、喻绍泉等一百九十多人被打死打伤，另有二十人因中毒过重及伤重，抬入战俘医院后身死！紧接着第二天，万恶的敌人，又以大量的毒气弹投向第二病伤战俘收容所，一千八百多名我方被俘人员全部中毒。中毒重的有王少忠、陈云等二百七十多人，并有龙品良等三人当场死去。口口声声讲着“人道主义”和“尊重”战俘“个人自由”的美国将军们，就是用这种惨无人道的大屠杀，来逼迫战俘接受“甄别”的。
    大屠杀结束后，全副武装的美军将三、二两所的我方被俘人员先后于二十一、二十二两日的下午押上汽车运往第十收容所。途中，鲜艳的国旗忽然出现在汽车上，汽车传出宏亮的歌声与“坚决要求全部遣返”的口号声。敌人虽施以种种威胁、殴打及一再停车“检查”，但都是白费。五月二十一、二十二两日的下午，美军军官先后对被押到第十收容所的第三、第二病伤战俘收容所的我方被俘人员，强行非法“甄别”。在“甄别”时，美军军官、台湾国民党残匪特务和李承晚匪军军官，用暴力强迫遭受百般折磨的我方被俘人员背门面向里站着，不准往后看，并宣布：你们背后有两条路，回大陆和北朝鲜的，出门向右转弯；到台湾和“大韩民国”的，向正中走……。他们企图以此骗我方被俘人员走上“台湾和南朝鲜之路”，同时还在路两旁布满了全副武装的美军和李伪军，百般恫吓和殴打我方被俘人员，来摧毁其坚决回国的意志。当我方被俘人员不顾美军的刺刀和特务们的棍棒，跑向回国的路时，美军军官和特务们，就无耻地用暴力将他们拖走。美军军官和特务们采用这种卑鄙的手段，扣留了被拘留在釜山战俘营各所的许多中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军被俘人员。被扣走的我方被俘人员，一面拚命挣脱，一面高喊着：“反对美帝扣留战俘！”“坚决回到祖国去！”残暴的美军军官竟将他们关了起来，却无耻地说是他们“拒绝遣返”！
    上述我方归来人员所揭发的事实，可以看出，美国侵略者采用了毫无人性的饥饿、屠杀等手段，来强迫扣留我方被俘人员。美国将军们所说的战俘
  “拒绝遣返”，不过是漫天大谎而已。
