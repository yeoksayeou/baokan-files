    I Grew Up with the Birth of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant
                Anshan Model Worker Lü Baofang

    The first automatic seamless steel tube plant in New China was built by our working class under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao and with the selfless assistance of Soviet experts. Now that it is about to officially start production, how can those of us who participated in the construction of this great project not be excited!

    I am an electrical installation worker with more than 20 years of experience. Through participating in the construction of the seamless steel tube plant, I have learned far more electrical installation techniques than I had in the past two decades. Therefore, I can say that I grew up with the birth of the seamless steel tube plant.

    In April 1953, I was transferred from the Electrical Installation Engineering Company to the construction site of the seamless steel tube plant to do electrical installation work. At that time, the construction site only had a dilapidated factory building, and the foundation bolts inside were rusty and peeling. Everywhere presented a desolate scene. There were many difficulties in starting work, but I thought, "Are there any difficulties that can stump our working class? As long as we have firm confidence, difficulties can be overcome." A few days later, a large number of pipe bending tasks came down, which were to be used in the underground cable pipeline project. According to the plan, there were to be tens of thousands of meters of underground cable pipeline engineering. This project was one of the largest and longest-term projects in electrical installation engineering. In the construction, it was closely coordinated with civil engineering, industrial pipelines, and other projects, so it was subject to more time restrictions due to the sequence of work. Other construction periods were generally very short, which increased the difficulties in construction. Moreover, the quality of the pipeline project directly affected the safety of future power transmission. Therefore, mastering scientific methods to effectively ensure project quality became very important. At that time, if the installation procedure was not understood and there was no reasonable labor organization, it would affect concrete pouring and mechanical installation. At this time, the leadership called on everyone to learn advanced experience and find tricks. So I and all the comrades in the group actively studied how to find tricks. After careful research, we decided to look for them in the scrap iron pile. One morning before going to work, I and several workmates found a pipe bending device in the scrap iron pile. We took it back to the group and added a scale and protractor to the pipe bending device. Using this pipe bending device improved work efficiency twelve times. Finally, we also found a way to cold bend two-and-a-half inch pipes, saving the country a lot of manpower and materials and advancing the pipe bending schedule. Through this pipe bending, the confidence of all the workmates in our group in completing the task was further strengthened.

    Since our group found the trick of the pipe bending device, the leadership has become more supportive and encouraging. On this basis, we also improved the pipe sweeping device, increasing work efficiency by 104 percent. In the pipe laying work, our group took the lead in implementing the assembly line operation method, which increased work efficiency by another one and a half times. Through last year's Northeast Conference for Promoting Advanced Experience, I learned the advanced experience of bending copper plates, and we seriously applied this advanced experience upon our return. Originally, workers could bend nine copper plates a day, but with the new method, one hundred copper plates were bent in four days, increasing work efficiency by more than eleven times.

    In order to ensure quality, we decided to first try to do a task, and after the Soviet experts checked and approved it, we would then carry out all the power distribution construction, so the quality of the power distribution panels all met the standards.

    Now, I have personally witnessed the successful early completion of our New China's first automatic seamless steel tube plant, which makes me rejoice for the victory of the motherland's path to industrialization. In the process of the basic construction of the seamless steel tube plant, my technical level has been improved, but I am not satisfied. I must continue to work hard to study business and learn humbly in order to catch up with the needs of the work.

    我是随着无缝钢管厂的诞生而成长起来的
                鞍山市劳动模范　吕宝芳
    新中国第一座自动化无缝钢管厂，是我们工人阶级在党和毛主席英明领导下和苏联专家的无私帮助下亲手建设起来的。如今它就要正式开工生产了，我们参加建设这一个伟大工程的人怎能不激动和兴奋呢！
    我是一个做了二十多年电气安装工作的电气安装工人。通过参加无缝钢管厂建设，我学到的电气安装技术，远远地超过了我过去二十多年学到的技术水平。因此说，我是随着无缝钢管厂的诞生而成长起来的。
    一九五三年四月，我由电气安装工程公司调到无缝钢管厂工地做电气安装工作。那时工地上只有一个被破坏得破乱不堪的厂房，厂房里的地脚螺丝锈的都爆皮了。到处呈现出一片凄凉的景象。干起活来困难是很多的，可是我想：“还有难得住咱们工人阶级的困难吗？只要咱们有坚定的信心，困难是可以克服的。”过了几天，就下来一大批揻管子的活，这是要用在安装地下电缆管道工程的。根据计划，要有数万米的地下电缆管道工程，这个工程是电装工程中工作量最大、工期较长的项目之一。在施工中又是和土建、工业管道及其他工程等密切配合进行的，因而受工序限制时间较多，其他工期一般均很短，这样就增加了施工中的困难，而且管道工程的质量好坏是直接影响将来安全送电的。因此，掌握科学的方法切实保证工程质量便成了十分重要的问题。当时如果不了解安装的程序，没有合理的劳动组织，就要影响混凝土浇灌和机械安装。这时领导上就号召大家学习先进经验和找窍门。于是我和全组的同志就积极地研究了如何找窍门。经过细心研究后，便决定到废铁堆里找找。一天早晨在上班之前，我和几个工友到废铁堆里找到了一个揻管器。我们就拿回小组里，把揻管器添上了标尺和角度尺。用这样揻管器工作提高工作效率十二倍。最后我们还找出了可以冷揻二吋半的管子，又给国家节省了很多人力物力，提前了揻管子工期。通过这次揻管子，我们全组工友对完成任务的信心更加坚定了。
    自从我们全组找出了揻管器的窍门以后，领导上更加支持和鼓励我们了。在这个基础上，我们又改进了扫管器，提高工作效率百分之一百零四。在铺管子工作中，我们全组带头实行了流水作业法，又提高工作效率一倍半。通过去年东北推广先进经验大会，我学到了揻铜板的先进经验，回来我们认真实用了这种先进经验。原来揻铜板工人一天揻九个，用新办法四天就揻了一百个，提高工作效率十一倍多。
    为了保证质量，我们研究决定先试做出一个活，找苏联专家检查合格后，再全部进行配电施工，所以配电盘的质量都达到了标准。
    现在，我亲眼看见了我们新中国第一座自动化无缝钢管厂胜利地提前竣工，使我为着祖国走向工业化的胜利而欢欣鼓舞。在无缝钢管厂基本建设过程中，我的技术水平得到了提高，但是我并不感到满足，我更要继续努力钻研业务，虚心学习，以便赶上工作的需要。
