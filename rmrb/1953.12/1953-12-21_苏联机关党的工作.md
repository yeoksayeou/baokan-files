    Soviet Party Work in Government Organs
    By Our Correspondent in Moscow, Li He
    
    I.
    
    In the Soviet Union, the state leads economic and cultural construction, so the efficiency of the work of state organs has a decisive influence on the achievements of construction. And the party work of the organs is one of the important conditions for ensuring that the state organs complete their tasks. In recent months, the Soviet Union has greatly strengthened the work of state organs, such as merging various government ministries, increasing the number of ministers, and implementing a new workday system in central organs. To understand the Soviet Party work in government organs, I recently visited Comrade Logvinenko, secretary of the Party branch of the Supervision and Inspection Bureau of the Soviet Ministry of Finance.
    
    Comrade Logvinenko is a section chief in this bureau and has been the party branch secretary for three consecutive years. According to him, the party branch of this bureau organizes its work according to the action program indicated by the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Party Central Committee. The party branch carries out two types of work: first, ensuring the coordination of the work of the organs; second, conducting ideological and political education for the staff members of the organs—both party members and non-party members. The party branch also combines collective work methods with individual work methods, paying attention to the education of individuals. The party branch maintains close contact with each party member and non-party member, promptly understanding their needs and difficulties and resolving them correctly.
    
    We know that, due to the special conditions of work in government organs, the party organizations in Soviet government organs do not exercise the function of supervising administrative work as do party organizations in production units. The supervision of the work of organs at all levels is carried out by the corresponding party organs. But this does not mean that the party organizations in government organs can ignore or not act upon the administrative work of their own organs. The party organizations in government organs, as guardians of the order of the organs, have the responsibility to ensure the coordination of the administrative work of the organs. An editorial in "Pravda" pointed out: "As guardians of the true Soviet order in the organs, the first thing is to ensure, through the Party's organizational and political work, that all links of the Soviet organs unswervingly and accurately carry out the instructions of the Party and the government. If a certain organ has not completed the instructions and directives of the Party and the government on time, if some staff members of this organ begin to condone violations of Soviet law, then it is the responsibility of the grassroots party organization to promptly remind them to pay attention."
    
    To fulfill the responsibility of such a guardian, the party organization of the organ must go deep into the work of the organ, requiring party members to pay attention to the current tasks of the organ, and bring the most important issues of the organ's work to the party meetings for discussion. According to Comrade Logvinenko, the party branch of the Supervision and Inspection Bureau of the Soviet Ministry of Finance strives to delve into the work of the bureau. The party branch congress discussed the bureau's 1951-1952 work summary, improved the supervision and inspection work in connection with the documents of the 19th Congress; and also discussed the implementation of the resolutions of the Ministry of Finance's ministerial meeting on improving supervision and inspection work and the tasks of party members. The party branch required party members to do a good job in their administrative positions and play an active role in their work. In basic construction and production, it is very important to tap the potential, and the work of the Supervision and Inspection Bureau also focuses on this aspect. In this way, the party branch pays attention to developing the enthusiasm of party members and the masses in this regard, and promotes a work style that attaches importance to even the smallest suggestions for tapping the potential. Whether the use of materials is economical and whether the steel shavings cut are too thick are all things to be noted. Now that the Party and the government have raised the prices for the sale and purchase of agricultural products, the Supervision and Inspection Bureau must strive to tap the potential for reducing production costs and turnover expenses in order to continuously reduce retail prices.
    
    The party organizations in government organs have the responsibility to influence the work of the organs through party members who are responsible for administrative work. According to Comrade Logvinenko, in production enterprises, the administrative负责人 [responsible person] should report on his work to the Party organization on behalf of the administration. In government organs, such as this bureau, the party branch and the party committee of the Ministry of Finance cannot require the administrative负责人 [responsible person] to report on his work on behalf of the administration, but can listen to the administrative负责人 [responsible person] report as a party member on the implementation of the decisions of the ministerial meeting, such as the implementation of the quarterly work plan, and then put forward appropriate criticisms and opinions. The administrative负责人 [responsible person] should take concrete measures to implement these criticisms and opinions in the work within a certain period. The major issues of the various departments of the national economy are the focus of attention of the party branch of this bureau. The 19th Congress of the Party criticized the shortcomings of some departments of the national economy. After studying the documents of the 19th Congress of the Party, the bureau inspected the reasons for the slightly higher product costs of the timber industry and the coal mining industry, and the causes of waste and defective products in the steel industry. Technical experts were involved in the inspection, because the financial staff understood economics but did not know much about technology. After the inspection, suggestions for economic and technical improvements were put forward. Recently, the party branch discussed the decision of the Ninth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee on further developing agriculture, and proposed that the bureau should financially inspect the implementation of the decision in various places in the first quarter of 1954.
    
    There has never been any discord between the party branch and the administration in the Supervision and Inspection Bureau. According to Comrade Logvinenko, if the administration has shortcomings and does not accept criticism, the party organization can and should appeal to the higher party committee. Although the party committee of the Ministry of Finance does not have the power to supervise the administrative work of the bureau, it can summon the负责人 [responsible person] of the bureau as a party member for talks. The party organizations of various Soviet government organs are led by the party district committees in their respective locations (for example, the party organizations of organs in Moscow City from the central to the local level are all led by the party district committees in the various districts of Moscow City); many things in the central organs can be reported directly to the minister and the Party Central Committee. Minister of Finance Zverev himself is a member of the Party Central Committee. The party committee of the Ministry of Finance and Zverev himself attach great importance to bottom-up criticism. The minister personally participates in the meetings of the party committee to hear the letters and complaints of the workers. The party members in the bureau are all engaged in supervision and inspection work, so they are serious about criticism.
    
    Comrade Logvinenko's remarks cannot but remind people of the importance attached to exposing and overcoming shortcomings in Soviet society, especially such a powerful means as timely reminders to the corresponding party organs. The Constitution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union states: "In the various government ministries, due to the special conditions of work in the Soviet organs, the party organizations cannot exercise the power of supervision. Their responsibility is to remind of the defects in the work of the organs, point out the shortcomings in the work of the ministry and its individual staff members, and submit the information and opinions they have learned to the Central Committee and the leaders of the ministry." Regarding reminders and criticisms, Comrade Trofimov, secretary of a party district committee in Moscow City, recently summarized some experiences in the party work of the organs in the district in the magazine "Communist." He cited the example of the work of the Housing Management Office under the Moscow Soviet Executive Committee. This management office for a time did not pay attention to the complaints and applications of the workers, and the work was not practical, which aroused legitimate reproaches. The party branch committee of the management office asked the administration to pay attention to strengthening the heads of the various sections and to clear up the letters and applications. But the administration did not take the necessary measures. The party organization asked the higher party organ to remind them to pay attention. Now the work of the management office has improved. Comrade Trofimov believes that the party organizations of the organs should pay attention to reminding them to pay attention to principled issues and major shortcomings, and should deeply expose the shortcomings and put forward opinions in a meticulous manner, and this should rely on the development of criticism, especially bottom-up criticism. He said: "Reminding of the shortcomings in the work of the organs means developing mass bottom-up criticism in the organs, supporting realistic suggestions, and resolutely opposing those who obstruct criticism and even attempt to suppress it. After the 19th Congress of the Party, criticism became more acute and effective. However, now criticism is often not as courageous as the criticism of shortcomings by party members in industrial enterprises. Speakers often evade sharp questions and remain silent about bureaucratic distortions." Comrade Trofimov criticized some incorrect attitudes towards criticism, such as: maintaining "a harmonious atmosphere"; hoping that "domestic scandals should not be publicized"; believing that criticism is "undermining prestige"; using counter-criticism to deal with critics; putting the leaders of the organs outside of criticism; and using the special nature of the work of the organs as an excuse to evade criticism. He pointed out that, according to the instructions of the 19th Congress of the Party, resolutely developing criticism and self-criticism is the most important method for improving the work of the organs and educating the staff members of the organs.
    
    II.
    
    Soviet state organs have always regarded raising the ideological and political level of staff members and improving the Marxist-Leninist cultivation of cadres as one of the most important conditions for improving the work of all links and ensuring that the organs complete their work tasks. Therefore, this is also one of the most important tasks of the party organizations of the organs.
    
    The cadres of the Supervision and Inspection Bureau of the Soviet Ministry of Finance are all inspectors of the national economy, so the party branch attaches special importance to the political study of cadres. According to Comrade Logvinenko, there are three forms of political study for cadres in Soviet government organs: cadres with a higher level of theoretical cultivation study on their own, those with a medium level participate in research groups (classroom discussion), and those with a lower level enter study groups. In addition, some cadres study at the Marxist-Leninist Night University or the Correspondence University. Party members and non-party members study together. The new academic year begins on October 1st every year. Cadres who study on their own have answerers to help them. They question the answerers, and the answerers also ask them questions to check the progress of their study. Cadres in research groups mainly study on their own, with collective discussions twice a month (two hours each time), studying political economy, dialectical materialism and historical materialism, etc. Study groups are divided into two types according to their level: one studies the Concise History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), and the other studies the Concise History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) with reference to the works of Lenin and Stalin. Study groups have tutors to help them. After the tutor gives a lecture on each lesson, questions are given, and they study on their own after class, and then conduct discussions under the guidance of the tutor, who can temporarily call on people to speak. Study groups lecture and discuss once every one or two weeks. The cadres of the Supervision and Inspection Bureau of the Soviet Ministry of Finance have a relatively high level of theoretical cultivation, and there are no study groups. In addition to five people studying on their own and a few people studying at the Marxist-Leninist Night University and the Correspondence University, all are organized in research groups to study. Half of the cadres of the bureau are in the organ, and half are out on inspection work. Therefore, two research groups are formed. The leaders of the research groups are the director and deputy director of the bureau, who have a higher level of theoretical cultivation. The content of the study is the same, but the one in the organ holds three discussion meetings a month (previously two), and the ones who are out study on their own, and hold two discussion meetings in the ten days after returning to Moscow. The study has a certain pace, and the prescribed books and questions are studied before each discussion. Encourage taking notes; it is also possible to read and think deeply without taking notes. Because there is research preparation in advance, the speeches at the discussion meetings are very active, supplementing each other and correcting each other. In addition, the party branch also organizes policy studies. Such as studying the documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Comrade Malenkov's report at the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and the decision of the Ninth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on further developing agriculture. When studying policies, special attention is paid to studying them in connection with the actual work of the department.
    
    Comrade Trofimov's essay in the magazine "Communist" also talked about the study of staff members of organs. He said that when guiding the theoretical study of cadres in organs, the party district committee pays attention to the characteristics of the various organs in the district. The district he leads has more industrial and financial organs, so he pays attention to improving the knowledge of staff members of organs in Marxist-Leninist economic theory, and educates cadres with the scientific principles of leading production and the correct attitude towards economic issues. When the party district committee and the party branch of the organ organized the theoretical education of the organ this academic year, they have already paid attention to not violating the voluntary principle of the staff members choosing which kind of study to take, that is, not indiscriminately including all staff members, even those who are willing to study Marxism-Leninism on their own, in the study organization without explanation or distinction, but only making regulations on what party members who have not grasped the minimum political knowledge must study. When conducting policy and cultural education for staff members, it is also conducted separately according to different political and cultural levels. For example, this September, the Moscow City Office of the State Bank held a general staff meeting summarizing the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the tasks of the office staff, as well as a report on the international situation, a lecture on the communist education of workers, etc. The lectures were conducted in groups. In addition, the leaders and staff of the office held a discussion on the issue of improving the level of work under the new workday system. For personnel with a lower level of culture, propagandists conducted discussions and even read newspapers. Comrade Trofimov believes that collective education methods do not exclude careful education of each individual. He criticizes such a situation: there are many large and small meetings, lectures, and reports held in the organ, and many people participate; but behind this "general inclusion" hides the shortcomings in individual education work.
    
    "Pravda" wrote in a recent editorial: "Party organizations have the responsibility to educate Soviet staff members with loyalty to the socialist motherland, with Soviet patriotism, and with a high degree of responsibility for the affairs entrusted to them, to recognize the national significance of the work they are performing." The editorial said that if political work touches on the defects and loopholes in the work of the organs, and if the party organizations use any good and bad things that have been revealed to educate staff members to fulfill their responsibilities to the state, then political work will yield satisfactory results.
    
    III.
    
    In the party work of organs, how to correctly organize party meetings is of great significance for improving the quality and effect of the meetings and for cherishing everyone's time. Since the implementation of the new workday system in Soviet state organs, it has been even more advocated that meetings should be held in a refined and short manner, and empty talk and procrastination that do not concretely solve problems should be even more opposed.
    
    The party branch of the Supervision and Inspection Bureau of the Soviet Ministry of Finance often discusses important issues in the work and study of the organ. According to Comrade Logvinenko, the branch has discussed: the tasks of the party branch in improving the quality of supervision and inspection work; measures to improve the selection, distribution, and training of cadres. The party branch congress discusses study issues twice a year. The party branch congress is held once or sometimes twice a month, and each time does not exceed four hours. Open meetings absorb non-party masses to participate. The party branch congress only discusses and solves one issue each time. First, the reporter reads a written report for forty minutes to an hour, and then the people participating in the meeting speak extensively. Each person speaks for ten minutes, repeats for five minutes, and explains for three minutes. If the issue discussed by the speaker is relatively important and exceeds ten minutes, it must be approved by the congress to extend it. The opinions summarized after the discussion must be guaranteed to be implemented in action. The key to holding a good meeting lies in the preparation before the meeting. Three to five days before the meeting, notify everyone of the issues to be discussed so that everyone can think about their opinions in advance. Before each meeting, the reporter is determined according to the nature of the issues to be discussed. The reporter can be a responsible cadre party member such as the director, deputy director, or section chief, or it can be an ordinary party member. Choose capable party members to make reports, but avoid always being the same person. In addition to selecting reporters, a temporary group of two or three people is also organized to be responsible for talking to party members, collecting materials related to the agenda, providing materials to the reporter, and they themselves are also prepared to speak at the meeting.
    
    Comrade Logvinenko used to be a group leader. Party group meetings mainly discuss issues within the scope of the subject and the department. The advantage of group meetings is that they are closer to party members, but according to his experience, they should also be appropriately adjusted to avoid too many meetings.
    
    The party branch congress only discusses the whole bureau and important issues, while the party branch committee discusses any issues. The branch committee holds two meetings a month, two or three hours each time. It does not discuss and solve every unimportant issue once, but brings together related issues to solve them in a comprehensive manner. For example, various shortcomings in the work are studied together. The branch committee discusses and solves one to three issues each time. The branch committee implements the principle of collective leadership, and everyone discusses and handles things together, not decided by the branch secretary or a certain committee member alone. The branch committee (five people) has a division of labor: the secretary is fully responsible, and the other branch committee members are responsible for political study, administrative business, trade union work, and newspapers and periodicals respectively. For example, the grouping of political study classes is collectively discussed by the branch committee; but the transfer of individual classes and other daily issues are resolved by the branch committee member responsible for political study. The party branch committee of the bureau reports to the branch congress on a regular basis, is directly led by the party committee of the Ministry of Finance, and maintains contact with the inspectors of the party district committee.
    
    How can a party branch committee member of an organ, especially the secretary, do a good job? Comrade Logvinenko said very sincerely: "The most important thing is to solve problems objectively and correctly. The main working method of party workers is persuasion. I have never shouted at people, because shouting is tantamount to coercion. Our main method is to make people understand the ideas we explain, understand them, and turn them into their own through persuasion. I think objectivity, fairness, and enthusiasm for helping people are the most important requirements for a party branch secretary."
    
    In Soviet organs, there is a strict division between party activities time and administrative work time. Since the party work of the organ is to ensure that administrative work is done well, party activities are not allowed to occupy business work time within eight hours; and in order to ensure that staff members have enough time for rest, study, and social activities, business work is also not allowed to occupy public rest time outside of eight hours of work. There is one day a week that is Party Day. Party meetings and staff studies are all outside of work time, and trade union activities related to employee welfare are also outside of work time. Only business meetings to report on administrative work and assign administrative work tasks are allowed to occupy work time.
    
    The party organizations of Soviet organs pay great attention to reasonably arranging work so as not to overburden certain activists. This is paid attention to in two aspects: on the one hand, the work is well planned. For example, if a report meeting on current affairs or a certain issue has already been held for all staff members of the organ, there is no need to make the same report in the various units within the organ; party branch committee members do not necessarily have to attend all meetings repeatedly. On the other hand, it is good at developing the enthusiasm of many party members. Logvinenko said very profoundly: "There are no party members who can't do things. It's just that some people have been absorbed to participate in social work, and others have not yet. We must absorb more people to do social work. From regular work such as propagandists to temporary work such as preparing for meetings, we must absorb people to participate. Only in this way can we give full play to the enthusiasm of all party members and the masses and do a good job in the party work of the organ."

    苏联机关党的工作
    本报驻莫斯科记者　李何
    一
    在苏联，国家领导着经济和文化建设，所以国家机关工作的效能对于建设的成绩起着决定性的影响。而机关党的工作是保证国家机关完成自己任务的重要条件之一。最近几个月来苏联大大加强了国家机关的工作，如像合并了政府各部，增加了部长的职务，以及中央机关实行新的工作日制度等等，为了了解苏联机关党的工作，我最近访问了苏联财政部监督检查局党支部书记洛格维连科同志。
    洛格维连科同志是这个局的一个科长，连任党支部书记已经三年。据他说：这个局的党支部是根据苏联共产党第十九次代表大会和党中央所指示的行动纲领来组织工作的。党支部进行着两种工作：第一，保证机关工作的协调；第二，对机关职员——党员和非党员进行思想政治教育。党支部还把对集体的工作方式和对个人的工作方式结合起来，注意对个人进行教育。党支部和各个党员、非党员都保持密切的联系，及时了解他们的需要和困难，加以正确的解决。
    我们知道，由于机关工作条件的特殊，苏联机关党的组织不行使生产机构中党的组织那种监督行政工作的职能。对各级机关工作的监督，由相当的党的机构来执行。但这并不是说，机关党的组织可以不管、不作用于本机关行政的工作。机关党的组织作为机关秩序的守察者，有责任保证机关行政工作的协调。“真理报”社论指出过：“作为机关中真正苏维埃秩序的守察者，首先就是说，以党的组织工作和党的政治工作保证苏维埃机关一切环节不偏地、准确地进行党和政府的指令。如果某机关没有按时完成党和政府的指令和指示，如果这机关有些工作人员开始纵容违背苏维埃法律，那么及时提醒注意，这是基层党组织的责任。”
    要尽到这样的守察者的责任，机关党组织必须深入机关工作中去，要求党员注意机关的当前任务，把机关工作的最重要问题拿到党的会议上讨论。据洛格维连科同志谈：苏联财政部监督检查局的党支部努力深入到局的工作中去。党支部大会讨论过局的一九五一—一九五二工作总结，联系十九次代表大会的文件改进监督检查工作；也讨论过执行财政部部务会议关于改进监督检查工作的决议与党员的任务。党支部要求党员做好所负的行政职务，在工作中起积极作用。在基本建设和生产中，发掘潜在力是很重要的，监督检查局的工作也从这方面着眼。这样，党支部就注意发扬党员和群众在这方面的积极性，提倡对发掘潜在力的点滴意见都要重视的工作作风。材料的使用是否节约，切割的钢铁刨屑是否太厚，都在注意之列。现在党和政府提高了农产品的交售和购买价格，但为了零售物价不断减低，监督检查局就要努力发掘减低生产成本和周转费用的潜在力。
    机关党组织有责任经过负责行政工作的党员作用于机关工作。据洛格维连科同志谈：在生产企业中，行政负责人要代表行政向党的组织报告工作。在机关中，如像这个局，党支部以及财政部的党委会，都不能要求行政负责人代表行政报告工作，但可以听取行政负责人作为党员报告执行部务会议决定的情况，如像执行季度工作计划的情况，然后提出适当的批评和意见。这些批评和意见，行政负责人要采取具体办法在一定的期间在工作中实现。国民经济各部门的重大问题，是这个局党支部注意的中心。党十九次代表大会批评了国民经济某些部门的缺点。党支部研究党十九次代表大会文件后，局检查了木材工业、采煤工业的产品成本稍高和钢铁工业中产生废料废品的原因。检查时吸收了技术专家参加，因为财政工作人员懂经济但不大懂技术。检查后提出在经济上和技术上改进的意见。最近，党支部讨论了党中央九月全会关于进一步发展农业的决定，提出了局在一九五四年第一季要在财政方面检查各地执行决定的情形。
    监督检查局从来没有发生党支部与行政不协调的事情。据洛格维连科同志谈：如果行政有缺点而不接受批评时，党的组织可以和应该向上级党委申诉。财政部党委虽然没有权监督局的行政工作，但可以把作为党员的局负责人召来谈话。苏联各机关党组织受所在地的党区委的领导（如莫斯科市从中央到地方的机关党组织都受莫斯科市各区的党区委的领导）；中央机关的许多事情可以直接报告部长和党中央。财政部部长兹维列夫同志本身就是党中央委员。财政部党委和兹维列夫本人都非常重视从下而上的批评。在党委开会审理劳动者的来信和控诉时，部长亲自参加。局里党员都是干监督检查工作的，所以对于批评是认真的。
    洛格维连科同志的谈话，使人不能不联想到苏联社会对于揭露和克服缺点的重视，特别是像向相当的党机构及时提醒注意这样有力的手段。苏联共产党党章说：“在政府各部内，由于苏维埃机关工作的特殊条件，党组织不能行使监督的职权，它们的责任是提醒注意机关工作中的缺陷，指出部及其个别工作人员工作中的缺点，并把自己所了解的情况和意见提交中央委员会及各该部的领导人。”关于提醒注意和批评，莫斯科市一位党区委书记特罗菲莫夫同志最近在“共产党人”杂志上总结了该区机关党的工作的某些经验。他举出莫斯科苏维埃执行委员会所属房屋管理处的工作例子。这个管理处有一个时期不重视劳动者的控诉和申请，工作不切实，引起正当的责备。管理处的党支部委员会请行政注意加强各科负责人，清理来信和申请书。但行政没有采取必要的措施。党组织请上级党机构提醒注意。现在管理处的工作改善了。特洛菲莫夫同志认为：机关党组织要注意在原则问题和重大的缺点上提醒注意，要深刻地揭露缺点和周密地提出意见，而这要靠展开批评特别是自下而上的批评。他说：“对机关工作中缺点的提醒注意，这就是说在机关内展开群众自下而上的批评，支持实事求是的建议，坚决反对那些阻挡批评以至企图压制批评的人。在党的第十九次代表大会以后，批评更加尖锐和有效了。然而现在在批评上还往往不如工业企业党员批评缺点那样勇敢。发言人往往回避尖锐的问题，对于官僚主义的歪曲保持缄默。”特罗菲莫夫同志批评了一些对待批评的不正确态度，如像：保持“一团和气”；希望“家丑不外扬”；认为批评是“破坏威信”；以反批评对付批评者；把机关的领导者放在批评之外；藉口机关工作的特殊性以逃避批评。他指出：根据党十九次代表大会的指示，坚决展开批评和自我批评是改进机关工作和教育机关职员的最重要方法。
    二
    苏联国家机关向来把提高职员的思想政治水平，把提高干部的马克思—列宁主义修养，看作改进各个环节工作和保证机关完成工作任务的最重要条件之一。所以，这也是机关党组织的最重要任务之一。
    苏联财政部监督检查局的干部都是国民经济的检查员，所以党支部特别重视干部的政治学习。据洛格维连科同志谈：苏联机关在职干部的政治学习有三种形式：理论修养较高的干部自修，中等的参加研究组（课堂讨论），较低的进学习组。此外，有些干部进马克思—列宁主义夜大学或函授大学学习。党员和非党员在一起学习。从每年十月一日开始新的学年。自修的干部，有解答员帮助。他们向解答员质疑，解答员也向他们发问题，检查学习的进度。研究组的干部以自修为主，每月两次（每次两小时）集体讨论，学习政治经济学、辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义等。学习组按程度又分两种：一种学习联共（布）党史简要读本，另一种学习联共（布）党史简要读本参考列宁斯大林著作。学习组有辅导员帮助。每课由辅导员作讲演后，发给问题，下课自习，然后在辅导员指导下进行讨论，辅导员可临时指名发言。学习组每一两星期讲演和讨论一次。苏联财政部监督检查局干部理论修养比较高，没有学习组。除五个人自修和个别人在马克思—列宁主义夜大学和函授大学学习的外，全部都组织在研究组学习。局的干部一半在机关，一半出外检查工作。所以组成两个研究组。研究组组长是理论修养较高的正副局长。学习的内容是一样的，但在机关的每月开三次讨论会（以前是两次），出外的人自修，回莫斯科后十天中开讨论会两次。学习有一定进度，每次讨论前研究规定的书籍和问题。鼓励作笔记；熟读深思而不作笔记也可以。由于预先有研究准备，讨论会上发言很活跃，互相补充，互相纠正。此外，党支部还组织政策学习。如像学习苏联共产党第十九次代表大会文件，马林科夫同志在苏联最高苏维埃第五次会议上的报告，苏联共产党中央九月全会关于进一步发展农业的决定。在学习政策时，特别注意和本部门实际工作联系起来研究。
   “共产党人”杂志所载的特罗菲莫夫同志的论文，也谈到机关职员的学习问题。他说：党的区委在指导机关干部的理论学习时，注意区内各机关的特点。他所领导的那一区工业和财政的机关较多，所以注意提高机关职员在马克思—列宁主义经济理论方面的知识，以领导生产的科学原则和对待经济问题的正确态度教育干部。党区委和机关党支部在这个学年组织机关理论教育时，已经注意不违背职员选择那一种学习的自愿原则，就是说，不是没有解释地、没有分别地把所有工作人员，连那些愿意自修马克思—列宁主义的，都编在学习组织里面，只对那些没有掌握起码政治知识的党员，才作必须学习什么的规定。对职员进行政策和文化教育时候，同样也根据不同的政治和文化水平，分别进行。例如，今年九月，国家银行莫斯科市办事处举行了苏联最高苏维埃第五次会议总结与办事处工作人员任务的全体职员报告大会以及国际形势的报告、劳动者共产主义教育的讲演等，讲演是分组进行的，此外，办事处的领导人员和职员座谈了在新的工作日制度下提高工作水平问题。对于文化程度较低的人员，鼓动员进行座谈以至读报。特罗菲莫夫同志认为，集体的教育方式绝不排斥对每个人单独地进行细心的教育。他批评这样的情况：机关里举行不少大会、小会、讲演、报告，许多人参加；可是在这“一般的包罗”后面隐藏着个别教育工作方面的缺点。
    “真理报”在最近一篇社论中写道：“党组织有责任教育苏维埃职员以忠于社会主义祖国，以苏维埃爱国主义，以对所委托的事务高度负责，来认识他们所执行的工作的国家意义。”社论说：政治工作如果接触到机关工作中的缺点和漏洞，如果党组织利用任何已经显露的好事和坏事来教育职员以对国家负责的态度完成他们的职责，那么政治工作将会得出完满的结果。
    三
    在机关党的工作中怎样正确地组织党的会议，对于提高会议的质量和效果，对于爱惜大家的时间，是有重要意义的。苏联国家机关自从施行新的工作日制度以来，更加提倡把会议开得精、开得短，更加反对不具体解决问题的清谈和拖延时间。
    苏联财政部监督检查局的党支部经常讨论机关工作和学习中的重要问题。据洛格维连科同志谈，支部曾讨论过：在提高监督检查工作的质量上党支部的任务；改进挑选、分配与培养干部的措施。党支部大会一年两次讨论学习问题。党支部大会每月举行一次，有时两次，每次最长不超过四小时，公开的会议吸收非党群众参加。党支部大会每次只讨论和解决一个问题。首先由报告人读了四十分钟到一个钟头书面报告，然后参加会议的人广泛地发言。每人发言十分钟，重复的五分钟，解释说明的三分钟。如果发言人所谈的问题比较重要，超过了十分钟，要征求得大会同意才可以延长，讨论后归纳起来的意见，要保证在行动中实现它们。会议开得好的关键在于会前的准备。开会以前三五天把讨论的问题通知全体，以便大家事先想好意见。每次开会以前，根据讨论的问题的性质，决定报告人。报告人可以是局长、副局长、科长等负责干部党员，也可以是普通党员。挑选干练的党员做报告，但是避免总是某一个人。除了挑选报告人外，还组织了两三个人的临时小组，负责和党员谈话，收集和议题有关的材料，把材料供给报告人，他们自己也准备在会上发言。
    洛格维连科同志以前当过小组长。党小组会议主要讨论本科本处范围以内的问题。小组会的好处在于更接近党员，但据他的经验，也要适当调节，也免开会太多。
    党支部大会只讨论整个局的和重要的问题，党支部委员会则讨论任何问题。支部委员会每月举行两次会议，每次两三小时。不是遇一件不重要的问题就讨论一次，而是把有联系的问题集中在一起全盘地解决。例如把工作中的各种缺点合在一起研究。支部委员会每次讨论和解决一个到三个问题。支部委员会实行集体领导的原则，遇事大家商量着办，不是由支部书记或某个委员单独决定的。支部委员会（五人）有分工：书记负总责，其他的支部委员分别负责政治学习、行政业务、工会工作、报刊。如政治学习班次的编组，由支部委员会集体讨论；但个别人的转班这类日常问题，由负责政治学习的支部委员解决。局的党支部委员会向支部大会定期报告工作，受财政部党委员会的直接领导，并且与党的区委员会的视察员发生联系。
    机关党支部委员，特别是书记，怎样才能做好工作呢？洛格维连科同志说得很诚恳：“最主要是客观地正确地解决问题。党的工作人员的主要工作方法是说服。我从来没有对人大声叫嚷，因为叫嚷就形同强迫。我们的主要方法是经过说服使人了解我们所解释的思想，领会它，把它变成他自己的。我认为，客观、公正、热心帮助人，这是对党支部书记的最重要要求。”
    苏联机关党务活动时间与行政工作时间有严格的划分。机关党的工作既然是为了保证行政工作做好，所以不允许党务活动占用八小时以内业务工作时间；而为了保证职员有足够时间休息、学习和社会活动，也不允许业务工作占用八小时工作以外的公余时间。每周有一天是党日。党的会议和职员学习都在工作时间以外，有关职工福利的工会活动也在工作时间以外。只有汇报行政工作和分配行政工作任务的业务会议，才被允许占用工作时间。
    苏联机关党的组织很注意合理地安排工作，不使某些积极分子负担过重。这从两方面注意：一方面很好地计划工作。例如，已经举行机关全体职员时事或某个问题的报告会，就不需要接着又在机关内各单位作同样的报告；党的支部委员不一定要重复出席一切会议。另一方面，善于发挥许多党员的积极性。洛格维连科说得很深刻：“没有不会做事的党员。只是有些人被吸收参加了社会工作，另一些人还没有。要吸收更多的人做社会工作。从鼓动员这样经常性工作到准备会议这样临时性工作，都要吸收人参加。这样才能发挥全体党员和群众的积极性，把机关党的工作做好。”
