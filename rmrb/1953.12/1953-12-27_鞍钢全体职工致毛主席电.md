To our beloved Chairman Mao:

With great excitement, we report to you that China's first mechanized and automated seamless steel tube plant and large rolling mill officially started operations today. Our rebuilt No. 7 blast furnace also started operations today.

Under your guidance, we have come to understand that to make our country independent and prosperous, we must realize socialist industrialization; we understand the importance of concentrating our efforts on heavy industry construction to realize socialist industrialization; we understand the consistency between the current interests of the working class and the long-term interests of the country; and we also clearly recognize the important role of building the seamless steel tube plant, the large rolling mill, and the No. 7 blast furnace in our country's industrial construction. Therefore, although we encountered many technical and work-related difficulties during the construction process, under your guidance, under the leadership of the Party and the government, and with the help of Soviet experts, through everyone's hard work and struggle, we finally overcame the difficulties and completed the construction tasks of the three projects ahead of schedule.

On this day when the seamless steel tube plant, the large rolling mill, and the No. 7 blast furnace begin production, our joy and happiness are difficult to describe in words. Over the past few years, in the process of Anshan Iron and Steel's development, especially in the construction process of these three projects, we have deeply realized the prospect of our motherland's gradual development and its increasingly powerful strength.

Beloved Chairman Mao, we know that there are still many shortcomings and difficulties in our work, and there are even greater constructions ahead of us, but under your leadership, under the shining of the Party's general line, we have full confidence in constantly correcting our shortcomings and overcoming difficulties, and completing the more important construction tasks and production tasks assigned to us by the country.

Beloved Chairman Mao, we assure you that we will certainly follow the instructions in your telegram and contribute all our strength to our great motherland. We will continue to work hard, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and strive to master production technology, improve product quality, and overfulfill the state plan!

We extend our highest respect to you! And wish you boundless longevity!

All Staff of Anshan Iron and Steel Company
