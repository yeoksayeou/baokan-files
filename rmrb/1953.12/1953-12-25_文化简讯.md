    Beijing's Ice Sports Will Be More Active This Year Than in Previous Years
    The skating season in the North has arrived, and the capital's people's skating activities this year will be more active than in previous years. Skating is one of the main winter sports activities for the people of the capital. The Beijing Municipal People's Government Sports Commission and four other units have jointly formed an Ice Sports Committee to uniformly lead the city's ice sports. This year, in addition to opening the Shichahai and the Working People's Cultural Palace skating rinks, Beijing will also bring the privately-owned Beihai skating rink under the management of the Beihai Park Management Office. The Zhongshan Park skating rink, which had been closed, will also be reopened. All skating rinks have expanded their area and added new equipment this year. The Shichahai ice rink has expanded to 36,000 square meters, an increase of nearly 10,000 square meters compared to the past, and will be equipped with spotlights. The ice hockey rink will also be equipped with nighttime lighting. The Beihai ice rink will add a 400-meter track. All ice rinks have areas designated for "beginners," "figure skating," and "ice hockey," and will provide guidance through pictures, broadcasts, and practical instruction to help everyone learn to skate. In order to further promote ice sports and discover and cultivate excellent skaters, a city-wide ice sports conference will be held at the beginning of next year.
