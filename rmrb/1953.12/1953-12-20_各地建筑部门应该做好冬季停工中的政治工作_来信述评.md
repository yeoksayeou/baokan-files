Construction Departments in Various Regions Should Do a Good Job in Political Work During Winter Shutdown
—Commentary on Letters Received
Li Ming
    Recently, we have received letters from construction workers, reflecting the desire of many temporary and seasonal workers in construction departments to become permanent workers or to have the construction departments make appointments for work next year. For example, some construction workers in Beijing wrote in their letters: "We have been working for a year and should be transferred to permanent positions." Another example is a group of seasonal workers at the Construction Engineering Office of the Central Foreign Trade Department. According to the contract, they should have returned home after November 13, but they still want to stay on the construction site. From the letters, it can be seen that the vast majority of these temporary and seasonal workers in the construction departments are farmers from rural areas. The main reason they make the above requests is that they see the country beginning large-scale construction projects in a planned way, and they actively want to participate in basic construction, but they do not recognize the importance of planned allocation of labor and agricultural production in national construction. In addition, some farmers who flowed into the cities from disaster areas fear that production and life will be difficult after returning to their hometowns, and some construction departments irresponsibly made statements when recruiting temporary workers, such as: "Three months to become a seasonal worker, six months to become a permanent worker," which is also a reason for the above situation.
    However, based on the existing basic construction forces and the requirements of next year's basic construction tasks, the construction departments do not plan to continue to expand the number of permanent workers, nor do they intend to make large-scale appointments for temporary workers. At the same time, the existing basic construction teams will also be subject to necessary rectification, and some personnel who are not suitable for working in the basic construction departments will be reasonably adjusted and properly arranged, such as some being mobilized to transfer to other jobs, and some must return to their hometowns for production. Therefore, according to the country's need for labor, it is difficult to meet the above requirements put forward by these temporary and seasonal workers. This year, there are many construction workers who need to return home after the winter project shutdowns. According to the statistics of 42 units under the preparatory committee of the Beijing Construction Workers' Union alone, 120,000 temporary and seasonal workers need to be mobilized to return home after the winter shutdowns. Therefore, it is an important political task for construction departments in various regions to conscientiously do a good job in the political work of the winter shutdown, and to educate the workers who need to return home after the shutdown to happily obey the needs of national construction.
    In this regard, there are already some good examples. For example, when dealing with the return home of temporary and seasonal workers, the Fifth Engineering Company under the Beijing Construction Engineering Bureau not only held a conference to publicize and explain the ideological problems commonly existing among the workers, but also registered the temporary and seasonal workers, explaining that if the task requires workers next year, the company will notify them; if it is not needed, they should be at ease in agricultural production and never blindly flow into the city, resulting in futile trips. In terms of life, the company has also done a good job of caring and helping the workers, such as helping them organize and purchase train tickets uniformly, so the workers are very satisfied. However, there are still a few construction departments that do not pay attention to this work, and take an irresponsible attitude of pushing things off to the returning workers, which should be noted. For example, when the project of the Northeast Hegang Civil Engineering Construction Company was nearing completion, instead of carrying out positive education on the workers' common reluctance to return home, they deceived the workers by saying: "After the project is completed, permanent workers can be given leave to go home, and temporary workers will also be arranged for other jobs as much as possible." But after the project was completed, some workers had not even settled their due wages, and the company forced the workers to move out of the dormitory. This has aroused great dissatisfaction among the workers. This situation has a bad impact on national construction and the relationship between the Party and the masses, and must be corrected immediately.
    In order to do a good job in the political work of construction workers during the winter shutdown, all regions should conduct a planned publicity and education on the general line of the state's transition period for construction workers. Through the publicity of the general line, workers should understand that as industrial construction develops, the number of workers needed by the country will increase; however, the country's construction must be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner, and all things cannot be done at once. The basic construction force must be adapted to the basic construction task. If it is blindly expanded, it will inevitably cause serious waste and losses. The situation of construction workers idling in many places this spring is a very obvious example, which is not good for the country or the people. Workers should also understand that with the development of industry, the country's need for grain and other agricultural products will inevitably gradually increase. In order to ensure the country's need for grain and industrial raw materials, support the country's socialist industrialization, and develop mutual assistance and cooperation to increase agricultural production is a very important task. As for the production and living problems of some farmers from disaster areas after returning to the countryside, as long as they work hard under the leadership of the local Party organizations and the people's government, all difficulties will be overcome. As long as the workers understand these principles and help them solve some practical difficulties that can be solved when they return home, they will happily engage in agricultural production actively according to the needs of the country.

### 各地建筑部门应该做好冬季停工中的政治工作——来信述评

    各地建筑部门应该做好冬季停工中的政治工作
    ——来信述评
    李明
    最近我们陆续收到一些建筑工人的来信，反映了目前建筑部门中很多临时工和季节工希望转为长期工或者希望建筑部门和他们预约明年工作的要求。如北京市的一些建筑工人来信说：“我们已经干了一年了，应该转为长期工了。”又如中央对外贸易部修建工程处有一批季节工，按照合同规定，在十一月十三日期满后就应该回家，可是他们还要留在工地上。从读者来信中可以看出：建筑部门中的这些临时工、季节工绝大部分都是来自农村的农民。他们所以提出以上要求，主要因为看到国家开始有计划的大规模的建设工作，就积极要求参加基本建设，但是没有认识国家建设需要有计划地调配劳动力和农业生产在国家建设中的重要作用。此外，部分从灾区流入城市的农民怕回乡后生产和生活有困难，某些施工部门在招收临时工时曾不负责任地乱说：三个月转为季节工，六个月转为长期工，也是造成以上情况的原因。
    但是，建筑部门根据现有基本建设力量和明年基本建设任务要求，已不准备再继续扩大固定工人的数量，也不拟大量预约临时工人；同时现有的基本建设队伍还要进行必要的整顿工作，对有一些不适合在基本建设部门工作的人员要分别地加以合理调整和妥善安排，如有的要动员转业，有的必须回乡生产。因此，根据国家建设需要劳动力的情况，这些临时工、季节工所提出的上述要求是很难满足的。今年冬季工程停工后需要回家的建筑工人人数很多，仅据北京市建筑工会筹备委员会所属四十二个单位的统计，冬季停工后需要动员回家的临时工、季节工就有十二万人。因此，认真做好冬季停工的政治工作，教育停工后需要回家的工人们愉快地服从国家建设的需要，这是各地建筑部门的一项重要政治任务。
    在这一方面，现在已经有了一些比较好的例子。如北京市建筑工程局所属第五工程公司在处理临时工、季节工回家时，不仅根据工人中所普遍存在的思想问题召开大会进行了宣传和解释，同时还对临时工、季节工进行登记，说明如果明年任务需要工人，公司就去通知；如果不需要，他们就应该安心于农业生产，绝不要盲目流入城市而招致徒劳往返的损失。在生活方面，公司也对工人做到了关怀与帮助，如帮助他们组织起来，统一购买车票等，因此工人感到很满意。但是，还有少数建筑部门对这项工作不加重视，而对回家的工人采取了推出了事的不负责任的态度，是应当提出注意的。如东北鹤岗土木建筑工程公司在工程将近结束时，不但对工人中普遍存在的不愿回家的思想不进行正面的教育，反而欺骗工人说：“工程结束后，固定工人可以给假回家，临时工也尽量另行安排工作。”但到工程结束后，有些工人连应得工资还未算清，该公司就强迫工人搬出宿舍。这就引起工人群众的很大不满。这种情况对国家建设以及党和群众的关系都有不好的影响，必须立即纠正。
    为了做好建筑工人在冬季停工中的政治工作，各地应该对建筑工人有计划地进行一次国家过渡时期总路线的宣传教育。通过总路线的宣传，使工人们认识：随着工业建设的发展，国家需要的工人数量将越来越多；但是国家的建设是要有计划、有步骤地进行的，不能把大小事情都一齐办完。基本建设力量必须和基本建设任务相适应，如果盲目扩展，必然会造成严重的浪费和损失。今年春季很多地方发生的建筑工人窝工情况，就是一个很明显的例子，这样无论对国家、对人民都是没有好处的。还要使工人们认识：随着工业的发展，国家所需要的粮食和其他农产品也势必要逐步增加。为了保证国家对于粮食和工业原料的需要，支持国家社会主义工业化的事业，发展互助合作、增加农业生产是一件十分重要的工作。至于某些来自灾区的农民回到农村后的生产和生活问题，只要他们在当地党组织和人民政府的领导下积极努力，一切困难都是会被克服的。只要使工人们了解了这些道理，并且帮助工人解决回家时一些可能解决的实际困难，他们是会愉快地根据国家需要，回家积极从事农业生产的。
