Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 21st: Skobeltsyn, Chairman of the "International Stalin Prize for Strengthening Peace" Committee, wrote an article in "Pravda" introducing the outstanding achievements of the 1953 prize winners. He pointed out that the recipients of the award include individuals who are well-known in their own countries and other countries for their dedication to the cause of peace.

    Joliot-Curie
    Among the recipients is Frédéric Joliot-Curie, an outstanding French political leader and member of the French National Assembly. Joliot-Curie is an outstanding representative of those social strata in France that, together with the national progressive forces, are striving to restore France to an independent national status and to implement policies that are beneficial to the people and cooperate with peace-loving countries in safeguarding international security.

    Salk
    Professor Jonas Salk, an Indian bacteriologist, has been engaged in scientific work for many years and has fought against diseases that continue to plague mankind. He has strongly condemned the U.S. military's use of bacteriological weapons in Korea, considering it the most serious crime against human conscience. He has put forward constructive proposals for launching a broad movement to strive for consultation among the major powers to resolve outstanding international issues.

    Gaggero
    Italian priest Don Andrea Gaggero has actively participated in the peace movement since its inception. He participated in the Second World Peace Congress despite the prohibitions of the church authorities, and was therefore persecuted by the church authorities. But persecution could not thwart the spirit of this indomitable fighter.

    Blum
    Isabelle Blum is a well-known Belgian public figure. She is a true patriot who has fought to defend her country's national independence and against the aggressive alliances imposed on Belgium. Today, she stands at the forefront of the fighters against the rearmament of West Germany and for the peaceful resolution of the German question.

    Fast
    The name of Howard Fast, the brilliant American writer and heroic fighter, is known all over the world. He is the embodiment of progressive, true America, the America of ordinary people who, like people of other countries, are deeply concerned about world peace and friendship among all nations.

    Bernal
    John Desmond Bernal, an outstanding British scientist and prominent public figure, constantly strives to develop science, believing that it is his responsibility to make science serve human progress and promote human liberation. He has done a great deal to unite scientists in his own country and other countries to defend science and oppose the use of scientific discoveries for war.

    Kruczkowski
    Leon Kruczkowski, a Polish writer, was known before the war as a brilliant representative of new, progressive trends in Polish literature. After the war, he became an active builder of the new people's Poland, dedicated to creating a progressive literature permeated with ideas of peace and progress.

    Neruda
    Pablo Neruda is one of the most outstanding progressive writers of our time. Neruda stood at the forefront of the peace movement of the people of all countries that developed after the war. As a poet and political commentator, his words on the rostrum of various world peace congresses have inspired millions to fight for peace through newspapers and periodicals.

    Andreen
    The Stalin International Prize was awarded for the first time to a representative of the Scandinavian countries: Dr. Andrea Andreen, Director of the Central Clinical Testing Laboratory of the Stockholm Municipal Hospital in Sweden and a prominent leader of the democratic women's movement. In 1952, she visited Korea and China as a member of the International Scientific Commission investigating the facts of bacteriological warfare in Korea and China. She saw with her own eyes the despicable acts of the U.S. military. What an objective person like Dr. Andreen said has convinced many people in the Scandinavian countries of justice, of the peace movement, and made them advocates of peace.

    Popova
    Nina Popova is a famous and outstanding Soviet public figure who actively participates in the Soviet people's struggle to defend world peace. Democratic publics in many countries also know that Popova is the Vice-President of the Women's International Democratic Federation. She and women from other countries are working hand in hand to accomplish the lofty goals and tasks of the Women's International Democratic Federation.
