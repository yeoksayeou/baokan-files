Xinhua News Agency, December 17th: The Vietnamese People's Army continues to pursue and annihilate enemy troops fleeing from Lai Chau, and some remnants have begun to surrender.

    On the 13th, one hundred enemy troops hiding near the Lai Chau provincial capital surrendered to the People's Army with their weapons. This group of enemy troops had fled into the jungle in a panic due to the pursuit of the People's Army.
    The Vietnamese People's Army, pursuing and annihilating the fleeing enemy, continued to advance rapidly along the mountain road between Lai Chau and Dien Bien Phu on the 12th and 13th. They have now encircled a portion of the fleeing enemy troops at Meng Dong, 14 kilometers south of Lai Chau, and fiercely attacked the enemy at Meng Po, 20 kilometers north of Dien Bien Phu. These enemy troops have been thrown into chaos as a result of the attacks, with many abandoning their weapons and scattering in all directions.

Xinhua News Agency, December 18th: The Vietnamese People's News Agency, December 17th: The Vietnamese People's Army has annihilated one enemy company and routed one enemy battalion in the battle to pursue and annihilate the fleeing enemy from Lai Chau; some remnants continue to surrender to the People's Army.

    While the Vietnamese People's Army surrounded the majority of the fleeing enemy troops at Meng Dong, 14 kilometers south of Lai Chau, they tracked and pursued the remaining small portion of enemy troops fleeing south, catching up with the enemy at Meng Po, 20 kilometers north of Dien Bien Phu, on the 12th. After 30 minutes of battle, the People's Army killed two platoons of enemy troops, captured one platoon, and routed one enemy battalion. At the same time, the People's Army destroyed the enemy's ammunition depot at Meng Po, 20 kilometers north of Lai Chau, seizing a large quantity of military supplies. In addition, the People's Army repelled a large number of paratrooper units hurriedly dispatched by the enemy from Dien Bien Phu in an attempt to salvage the defeat at Meng Po, inflicting heavy casualties on these enemy troops.
    Enemy troops stationed in the northern Lai Chau area, unable to retreat to Dien Bien Phu due to the rapid liberation of Lai Chau, fled into the jungle. The morale of these enemy troops is very low, and another forty have surrendered to the People's Army. To date, the number of enemy troops surrendering has increased to one hundred and forty.

Xinhua News Agency, December 18th: The Vietnamese People's News Agency, December 17th: The Vietnamese People's Army shot down an enemy fighter plane over Sang Men, 11 kilometers south of Dien Bien Phu, on December 6th; and on the 13th, they raided the enemy's forward outpost at Xinglin, 4 kilometers northeast of Dien Bien Phu, killing and wounding one enemy company.

    In addition: At 9:00 AM on December 1st, the Lao People's Liberation Army shot down an enemy "B-26" bomber over Nam Bo in northern Laos.

Xinhua News Agency: The Vietnamese People's News Agency reports: On December 8th, the Vietnamese People's Army anti-aircraft artillery units shot down an enemy fighter plane 10 kilometers outside the capital of Yen Bai Province in North Vietnam. The pilot was killed instantly, and the People's Army seized two heavy machine guns.
