The General Line Inspired the Production Enthusiasm of the Working Masses

    Every Drop of Our Sweat Is for the Realization of Socialism
    Liu Qingxiang, Shandong Provincial Industrial Labor Model
    Chairman Mao said: The General Line is the lighthouse illuminating all our work. This lighthouse also illuminates our machine manufacturing industry. Looking at the development of our factory over the past four years, and thinking about the beautiful prospects of realizing socialist industrialization in our country, we are even more encouraged to struggle for the implementation of the General Line during the transition period of the state.
    Four years ago, our factory relied on belt-driven lathes for production. It was a dilapidated repair shop. Now it has a large number of precision motor lathes, large planers, milling machines, grinders and other mechanical equipment, and has become a modern factory. In the past, we could only produce simple machines such as waterwheels and cement mixers. Now we can produce sophisticated large-scale Soviet-style gantry planers. At the same time, the lives of our workers have also improved significantly.
    In the past, seeing these changes, I thought it was already amazing. After hearing the report on the General Line of the state during the transition period, I realized that this was just the beginning of the country's economic construction, and the great construction was yet to come. The state will require us to: produce a large number of high-quality and inexpensive machine tools to meet the needs of national construction, assemble more modern new factories, and realize the country's socialist industrialization as soon as possible; the state also requires us to manufacture a large number of tractors, combine harvesters, etc. for our farmer brothers to help them carry out the socialist transformation of agriculture. Every minute of our labor today, every drop of sweat, is for the realization of socialism. We must contribute all our strength to this great cause.

    I Want to Add a Brick to the "Socialist Building"
    Wang Kerang, Electrician, Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory
    I listened to the report on the state's socialist industrialization and saw the beautiful prospects, and I became more and more happy. But I also thought: good days will not fall from the sky, socialism must be created by everyone's hard work. Our workers breaking quotas, overfulfilling the production increase and savings plan, or making a rationalization proposal to improve production, are all for building socialism, just like adding a brick or a tile to the "socialist building." I realized that I should contribute my greatest strength to the construction of the motherland, so I thought of a lot of broken motors.
    Speaking of the motors in our factory, most of them were left by the Japanese invaders. They were old and bad. After the factory launched the production increase and savings campaign, the speed of the machines increased, the load on the motors increased, and the number of broken motors increased again. If this continues, if the machine stops, production will stop, and the production increase and savings plan will not be completed. Wouldn't this affect socialist industrialization? Thinking of this, I felt that my most important task at present is to protect the motors so that they do not affect production.
    One day I was on the night shift and saw in the handover record book that three broken motors had been dismantled today. So I used my brain on this and studied where the problem was. After thinking about it for several days, I finally found the cause of the motor failure. Our suggestions have been realized with the attention and help of the administrative leaders. Recently, not a single motor has failed, and I am very happy because I have contributed a share of strength to the motherland.

    Seeing the Socialist Road Clearly, I Love My Work Even More
    Chen Pizhi, Leader of the Marking Group, Cold Working Workshop, Shenyang Transformer Factory
    We must rely on our own hands to create a happy life. Why did Wang Chonglun take the initiative to increase his quota and dream of creating tools! Isn't it because he saw this clearly! We workers and brothers participating in the great construction cause of the motherland should all learn Wang Chonglun's spirit in the Five-Year Plan.
    With Wang Chonglun's advanced thinking, new achievements can be created in any job position. For example, take myself, at first I always thought that there was no trick to our manual work. I hurried home as soon as I got off work, and piled up a lot of iron plate edges, not caring at all, but after I saw the bright socialist road clearly, I loved my work. Strangely enough, when I cared about my work, my eyes lit up and the problem could be discovered. In the past, I saw a lot of iron plate edges cut down and didn't care at all, but later I thought: these iron plates are all shipped from abroad, they are very expensive, it is a pity to cut so many edges as waste, can we change the cutting method to reduce the loss? After painstaking research, and discussing with comrades to give play to collective strength, we finally researched a new cutting method. In the past, one iron plate could only cut one transformer tank skin, but now it can cut three tank skins. From January to August this year, we have saved more than 80 tons of iron plates for the country. In the future, I will continue to learn from Comrade Wang Chonglun and contribute the greatest strength to the country's socialist industrialization.

    It Turns Out That We Have Already Boarded the "Big Ship" to Socialism
    Xu Yu, Health Section, Huaibei Salt Affairs Administration
    In the past, I only knew that our motherland would definitely move towards socialism in the future, just like the Soviet Union. But how far is this road? How to go? These questions are like a thick fog, covering my eyes, and there is no "bottom" in my heart. Sometimes I think to myself: I "probably won't" see socialism in my lifetime, and the good days of socialism have no "share" for me. After listening to the report on the "General Line and General Task during the Transition Period," my eyes lit up! It's really gratifying: it turns out that we have already boarded the "big ship" sailing towards socialism, with the great Chairman Mao at the helm, and the selfless assistance of the Soviet elder brother. As long as all of us on the "ship," regardless of men, women, old or young, whether rowing, poling, or raising the sail, work together in various positions, the "ship" can steadily lean on the socialist "shore."
    Of course! The water will not be calm and smooth; winds and waves will continue to impact us and hinder our progress. However, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, as long as the working class and the people of the whole country work together, the difficulties in the voyage can be completely overcome. In order to ensure the realization of the General Line during the transition period and reach socialism as soon as possible, I am willing to work hard to learn from the advanced work experience of the Soviet Union, and work with all the medical and health personnel in the factory to contribute all my energy to improving the hygiene of the salt field and protecting the health of the workers.

### 总路线鼓舞了工人群众的生产热情

    总路线鼓舞了工人群众的生产热情
    我们的每一粒汗珠，都是为了实现社会主义
    山东省工业劳动模范  刘庆祥
    毛主席说：总路线是照耀我们各项工作的灯塔。这座灯塔，也照亮了我们的机器制造工业。看看我们工厂四年来的发展，想想我国实现社会主义工业化的美丽远景，更鼓舞我们为贯彻国家过渡时期的总路线而奋斗。
    四年前，我们的工厂是依靠皮带车床生产的，是一个破旧的修理厂，现在已经有着大量精密的马达车床，大型的刨床、铣床、磨床等机械设备，变成现代化的工厂了。以前，我们只能够生产水车、洋灰搅拌机等简单机器，现在已能生产精密的大型苏联式龙门刨床了。同时，我们工人的生活也有了显著的改善。
    在过去，看到这些变化，觉得已经是了不起了。听了关于国家在过渡时期的总路线的报告后，才觉得这不过是国家经济建设的开始，伟大的建设还在后头。国家将要求我们：生产出大批又好又便宜的工作母机，适应国家建设的需要，装配更多现代化的新工厂，使国家的社会主义工业化早日实现；国家也要求我们，为农民兄弟制造出大批拖拉机、联合收割机等，帮助农民兄弟进行农业的社会主义改造。我们今天的每一分钟劳动，每一粒汗珠，都是为了实现社会主义，我们一定要为这个伟大的事业贡献出我们一切的力量。
    我要为“社会主义大楼”添上一块砖
    上海第二棉纺织厂电气工  王克让
    我听了国家社会主义工业化的报告，看到了美丽的远景，心里越想越高兴。但是我又想到：美好的日子不会从天上掉下来的，社会主义要靠大家艰苦劳动来创造。我们工人突破定额，超额完成增产节约计划，或是提一个合理化建议来提高生产，都是为了建设社会主义，就好像是为“社会主义大楼”添上一块砖、一块瓦。我认识到自己应该为建设祖国贡献出最大力量，于是我就想起一大堆坏马达的事情来。
    说起我们厂里的马达，大都是日寇丢下来的，又旧又坏。厂里增产节约运动开展后，车子加快了，马达的负荷加重，坏马达又增加了。这样下去，如果机器一停，生产就会停顿，增产节约计划就完不成，这不就是影响社会主义工业化建设吗？想到这里，我觉得目前我的最重要的任务，就是要保护好马达，不使它影响生产。
    有一天我上夜班，看见交班记录簿上写着：今天拆下三部坏马达。于是我就在这上面动脑筋，研究毛病在那里。想来想去想了好几天，马达出毛病的原因终于被我找出来了。我们的建议在行政领导方面的重视和帮助下都实现了。最近，马达一只也没有出过毛病，我非常高兴，因为我为祖国贡献出了一分力量。
    看清社会主义道路，更加热爱我自己的工作
    沈阳变压器厂冷作车间划线组组长  陈丕志
    我们要过幸福的生活不是靠别的，正是要靠自己的双手去创造。王崇伦为什么主动要求提高自己的定额，做梦也想着创造工具呢！还不是他看清了这点吗！我们工人弟兄参加祖国伟大的建设事业，在五年计划中都应该学习王崇伦的这种精神来工作。
    有了王崇伦那样的先进思想，不论在什么工作岗位上都能创造出新的成绩。比如拿我自己来说吧，起初我总认为我们手工活是找不出什么窍门的，一下班就赶紧往家跑，每天裁的铁板边子堆一大堆，一点也不在意，但是当我看清了光明的社会主义道路之后，就热爱起自己的工作来了。说也奇怪，当我关心了自己的工作，眼睛就亮了，问题就能发现了。过去我看到裁下来的一大堆铁板边子，一点不关心，后来我却这样想：这些铁板都是从国外运来的，很贵重，裁下这么多的边子当废料，真是太可惜了，能不能改变一下裁法，少损失一些呢？经过苦心研究，又和同志们商量发挥集体力量，我们终于研究出了新的裁法，过去一张铁板只能裁一个变压器箱皮，现在可以裁三个箱皮，从今年一月到八月，已经为国家节省了八十多吨铁板。今后，我要继续向王崇伦同志学习，为国家社会主义工业化贡献最大的力量。
    原来我们已坐上到社会主义去的“大船”
    淮北盐务管理局卫生科  徐愚
    以前，我只晓得我们祖国将来一定要走到社会主义，跟苏联一样。可是，这条道路究竟有多远？怎样走法？这些问题就好比一层大雾，遮住了自己的眼睛，心里也没得个“底”。有时自己这样想：我这辈子“恐怕不会”看到社会主义，社会主义的好日子没有“我的份”。听了关于“过渡时期总路线、总任务”的报告后，眼睛一下子亮啦！真可喜：原来我们已经坐上向社会主义航行的“大船”，有伟大的毛主席掌舵，有苏联老大哥的无私援助，只要我们“全船”的人，不分男女老少，不管是摇橹的，撑篙的还是起篷的，在各种不同的岗位上一齐出力，“船”就可以稳当地靠上社会主义的
  “岸”。
    当然喽！水面上不会风平浪静一帆风顺的；风浪还会不断地向我们冲击，阻挡我们前进。可是，在共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，只要工人阶级和全国人民一致努力，航行中的困难是完全可以克服的。为了保证过渡时期总路线的实现，早日到达社会主义，我愿意努力学习苏联的先进工作经验，和全场医务卫生人员一道，为搞好盐场卫生、保障职工身体健康而贡献出自己的全部的精力。
