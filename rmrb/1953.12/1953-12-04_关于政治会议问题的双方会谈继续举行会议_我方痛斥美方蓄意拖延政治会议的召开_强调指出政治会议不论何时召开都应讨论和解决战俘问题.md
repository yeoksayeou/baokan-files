Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 3rd: The delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China participating in the bilateral talks on the Political Conference issue issued the following communique:

    On December 3rd, the sixteenth meeting of the bilateral talks on the Political Conference issue was held. Mr. Qi Shi-fu, the representative of our side, spoke first, condemning the other side's unreasonable claims regarding the three issues of the Soviet Union's neutral status, the authority of neutral nations, and the issue of prisoners of war, and exposing the other side's conspiracy of deliberate delay. Mr. Qi Shi-fu pointed out: Since both sides have agreed that the Political Conference should take the form of equal meetings between the two sides, and the Soviet Union is not one of the belligerent parties, the Soviet Union should naturally be in a neutral position at the Political Conference. The other side has already acknowledged that the Soviet Union is a third party outside of the belligerent parties, but refuses to acknowledge it as a neutral country, which shows that the other side can no longer find any basis to defend its absurd claims. Therefore, it has to formally acknowledge that the Soviet Union does not belong to either of the belligerent parties, but in practice it is deliberately mystifying the issue and insisting on classifying the Soviet Union as a belligerent party. Our side absolutely cannot agree to this unreasonable claim from the other side. On the issue of neutral countries participating in the Political Conference, we agree that neutral countries should conduct discussions at the Political Conference according to the agenda items determined by agreement between the two sides, and should not participate in voting in the Political Conference or its subsidiary bodies. However, our side believes that the participation of neutral countries in the discussion of agenda items agreed upon by both sides at the Political Conference should not be subject to any restrictions. The other side deliberately distorts this point and places extremely unreasonable restrictions on the authority of neutral countries at the Political Conference, including their right to participate in discussions. On the one hand, the other side denies the Soviet Union as a neutral country, and on the other hand, it completely cancels the right of neutral countries to freely speak at the Political Conference. Its purpose is clearly to attempt to deprive neutral countries of their position at the Political Conference, so that neutral countries completely lose their due role at the Political Conference. Furthermore, in its statement on the 2nd, the other side openly claimed that the Political Conference can only discuss the issue of prisoners of war during the period from December 22nd of this year to January 22nd of next year. This is completely absurd and without basis. Due to the other side's instigation of Li and Chiang Kai-shek's special agents to wantonly sabotage, the "scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" among our captured personnel can no longer be implemented. Therefore, the so-called unilateral misinterpretation that the interpretation period will expire on December 22, 1953, and that the status of prisoners of war can be changed on January 22, 1954, without discussion at the Political Conference, is fundamentally untenable. Mr. Qi Shi-fu emphasized that the Political Conference, whenever convened, must discuss and resolve the issue of prisoners of war. It is precisely because the other side is afraid of discussing the issue of prisoners of war at the Political Conference and attempts to take unilateral action to forcibly detain our captured personnel that it uses various methods to delay the convening of the Political Conference.

    In order to delay the bilateral talks, the US representative continued to stubbornly deny the neutral status of the Soviet Union, still insisted on its absurd claim of conspiring to forcibly detain our captured personnel, and continued to insist on its unreasonable claims regarding the issue of neutral countries participating in the Political Conference as members, attempting to fundamentally deprive neutral countries of any right to express opinions.

    Our representatives Huang Hua and Qi Shi-fu immediately refuted this one after another based on specific facts, and sternly pointed out: Since our side put forward a comprehensive proposal on November 30th, the other side has not put forward any constructive opinions for serious discussion of our proposal, but has blindly adopted unreasonable delaying tactics, resulting in no progress in the bilateral talks for several days, falling into stagnation. Finally, our side solemnly warned the other side that our side has made great efforts and put forward fair, reasonable and practical comprehensive suggestions for the entire agenda. Now, whether the two sides can reach an agreement in this meeting depends entirely on whether the other side has the sincerity to negotiate. If the other side does not change its unreasonable attitude, then the other side should bear all the responsibility for delaying the convening of the Political Conference.

    关于政治会议问题的双方会谈继续举行会议
    我方痛斥美方蓄意拖延政治会议的召开
    强调指出政治会议不论何时召开都应讨论和解决战俘问题
    【新华社开城三日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国参加关于政治会议问题双方会谈的代表团发表公报如下：
    十二月三日，关于政治会议问题的双方会谈举行第十六次会议。我方代表奇石福先生首先发言，斥责对方对苏联的中立国地位、中立国权限及战俘问题等三个问题的无理主张，并揭发对方蓄意拖延的阴谋。奇石福先生指出：双方既已同意政治会议应该采取双方对等会议的形式，而苏联又非交战双方中的一方，那么苏联在政治会议中自应处于中立国地位。对方已经承认苏联是交战双方以外的第三者，但又不肯承认其为中立国，足见对方已找不到任何根据为其荒谬主张辩护，因此不得不在形式上承认苏联不属于交战双方中的一方，而又在实际上故弄玄虚，硬要把苏联划为交战的一方。对方这种无理主张，我方绝对不能同意。在中立国参加政治会议的问题上，我们同意中立国在政治会议中应按双方协议确定的议程项目来进行讨论，并在政治会议或其附属机构中不参加表决，但我方认为中立国家在政治会议中参加经双方协议的议程项目的讨论，应不受任何限制。而对方对于此点故意加以曲解，并对中立国在政治会议中的权限，包括它们参加讨论的权利，加以极其无理的限制。对方一方面否认苏联为中立国，另一方面又根本取消中立国在政治会议中的自由发言的权利，其目的显然是企图剥夺中立国家在政治会议中的地位，使中立国在政治会议中完全失去其应有的作用。又，对方在二日的发言中，公然声称政治会议只能在今年十二月二十二日至明年一月二十二日的期间讨论战俘问题，这是完全荒谬和没有根据的。由于对方指使李、蒋特务肆意破坏，在我方被俘人员中“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”早已不能实施，因此所谓一九五三年十二月二十二日解释期满及未经政治会议讨论即可在一九五四年一月二十二日改变战俘身份的片面曲解，根本不能成立。奇石福先生强调指出：政治会议不论何时召开，都必须讨论和解决战俘问题。正由于对方害怕在政治会议中讨论战俘问题，并企图采取片面行动强迫扣留我方被俘人员，所以用种种办法来拖延政治会议的召开。
    美方代表为了拖延双方会谈，继续顽固地否认苏联的中立国地位，仍然坚持其阴谋强迫扣留我方被俘人员的荒谬主张，而对于中立国作为成员参加政治会议的问题则继续坚持其无理主张，企图根本剥夺中立国发表意见的任何权利。
    我方黄华及奇石福两代表当即先后根据具体事实痛加驳斥，并严词指出：自从我方于十一月三十日提出全面建议以来，对方迄未提出任何建设性意见对我方建议进行认真讨论，却一味采取无理的拖延手段，以致双方会谈数日来毫无进展，陷于停滞。最后我方郑重警告对方，我方已经作了极大的努力，就全部议程提出了公平合理、切实可行的全面的建议，现在双方能否在此次会谈中达成协议，全视对方有无谈判诚意，如对方再不改变其无理态度，则对方应负拖延政治会议召开的全部责任。
