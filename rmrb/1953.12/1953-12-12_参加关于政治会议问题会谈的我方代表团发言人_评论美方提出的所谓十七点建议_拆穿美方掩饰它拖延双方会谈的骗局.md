Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 10th: The spokesman of the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China participating in the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference commented today on the "seventeen-point proposal" put forward by the U.S. side on the 8th, stating: Empty and without substance, the main characteristic of the U.S. seventeen-point proposal is that it does not answer the key questions raised in the comprehensive proposal of the Korean-Chinese side on November 30th regarding the political conference.

The U.S. side merely feels that its various unreasonable demands can no longer be peddled in Panmunjom and to the world under the firm opposition of the Korean-Chinese side, so it has exhausted its means to piece them together, repackage them, and try to use them to confront our comprehensive proposal in order to confuse the public. However, no matter how people look at it, they cannot find much constructive content in it. Not only that, but on several key issues, it is even worse than what the U.S. side itself has expressed in the past. Therefore, this "proposal" is merely a replay of the old trick of the U.S. side to delay negotiations. Peace-loving people around the world cannot but be highly vigilant about this.

The spokesman specifically analyzed the U.S. "seventeen-point proposal," saying that it is well known that the main obstacle to progress in the talks in Panmunjom is the U.S. side's consistent and stubborn refusal to accept the Korean-Chinese side's proposal to invite neutral nations to participate in the political conference and play an active role. The Korean-Chinese side has repeatedly pointed out that neutral nations have the right to fully discuss the agenda agreed upon by both sides, which is necessary for the smooth progress of the political conference to reach an agreement. And it specifically proposed the Soviet Union, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Burma as the five neutral nations to participate in the political conference. This proposal has been widely welcomed by world opinion and is considered a major action to promote the convening of the political conference. However, the U.S. side still adopts an evasive and opposing attitude towards this in its "proposal." This shows that the U.S. side currently has no good intentions and does not want to meet the demands of the people of the world and reach an agreement with us.

The spokesman pointed out that one of the most absurd arguments of the U.S. side in the Panmunjom talks is the unreasonable denial of the neutrality of the Soviet Union, and its insistence that the Soviet Union participate in the political conference as a member of our side. In response, our side has repeatedly warned the U.S. side that this nonsense not only completely ignores the historical fact that the Soviet Union has always strictly maintained neutrality in the Korean War and has consistently advocated a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, but also overturns Article 37 of the armistice agreement regarding the definition of neutral nations. Our firm opposition to this is our unchangeable position. However, the U.S. side still insists on this bankrupt fallacy in its proposal. The U.S. side even contradicts itself, listing the Soviet Union outside of both sides, while also wanting the Soviet Union to participate in voting like the belligerent nations. If the U.S. side does not intend to delay the dispute, why would it make such unreasonable demands? The spokesman then commented on the U.S. proposal's so-called "certain or all governments whose nationals are now working in Korea, or have current experience in Korea, and are now familiar with the problems of Korea, invited by both parties to attend and participate in the political conference," saying that here, the U.S. side is obviously afraid to directly reject the five neutral nations proposed by our side to be invited, so it has to use this ambiguous language to perfunctorily deal with the issue. If the U.S. side had at least agreed in appearance in the past that it was necessary to invite neutral nations to participate in the political conference, then now it is actually shelving the issue of inviting neutral nations to participate in the political conference and not resolving it. This is not only a step backward, but simply a deliberate deception.

Regarding the issue of the authority of neutral nations in the political conference, the spokesman pointed out that the U.S. side, in its "proposal," not only continues to insist on the various unreasonable restrictions it has advocated in the past, but also adds a new restriction, namely, the so-called "no formal motions or proposals may be submitted." The spokesman asked: "If the suggestions of the neutral nations are helpful to the two sides of the armistice agreement to reach an agreement, and are helpful to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, why can't they be submitted?" Although the U.S. side is deterred by the just demands of the Korean-Chinese side and dares not disagree with inviting neutral nations, it still tries its best to weaken and reduce the role of neutral nations to the point of nothingness. We solemnly warn the U.S. side that these insulting conditions are not acceptable to the Korean-Chinese side, nor can they be accepted by any neutral nation with self-respect.

The spokesman pointed out that in terms of voting procedures, the U.S. side still refuses to give up its so-called "unit voting" method, but this time it is not so clear, and it is said to be "each party shall determine its own procedures for expressing agreement or disagreement on decisions." The Korean-Chinese representatives have clearly exposed that the so-called "unit voting" is just a trick prepared by the U.S. side to reserve room for the treacherous behavior of its members. In the armistice negotiations this summer, the ink on the U.S. representative Harrison's signature on the scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission was not yet dry, and the Lee Seung-man gang forcibly detained 27,000 of our captured personnel in the name of "release." This is an undeniable historical fact of the U.S. side. Just now, as soon as the U.S. side expressed that it could invite "certain..." countries to participate in the political conference, the Lee Seung-man gang immediately made a big fuss and expressed their opposition. May I ask what can the United States guarantee that the blank check it signed alone can be fully honored by the seventeen countries it represents? The spokesman then pointed out that the "seventeen-point proposal" vainly attempts to stipulate that the bilateral talks should not decide on the agenda for the political conference at all, but leave it to the political conference itself to decide. Just a day ago, the U.S. representative, under our questioning, had to admit that the "first three items of the agenda we proposed are in line with the armistice agreement and the scope of authority related to prisoners of war, and are issues that must be dealt with in the political conference." Now, suddenly, the entire agenda is completely denied. The U.S. side's intention is obviously to overturn the provisions of the armistice agreement regarding the agenda of the political conference, to make the political conference fall into disputes over the agenda from the very beginning, to prevent the issue of prisoners of war from being discussed in a timely manner, and to prevent neutral nations from participating in the political conference from the beginning. Is there any doubt about this?

Regarding the administrative arrangements for the political conference, the spokesman pointed out that there is a great joke in the U.S. proposal. Everyone knows that the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea under the banner of the United Nations. The United States claims to represent the United Nations, while the Korean-Chinese side has no representatives in the United Nations. However, the U.S. side now vainly wants us to accept the United Nations secretariat as the service organization for the political conference to replace the joint secretariat jointly organized by both parties that we proposed. Not only that, but the U.S. side even requires representatives of both sides to jointly discuss the rules of procedure and other related administrative and procedural matters of the political conference with representatives appointed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, attempting to change the equal rights of both parties in deciding these matters. These, of course, cannot be regarded as serious suggestions at all, but can only be laughed at. The spokesman also pointed out that when the U.S. representative Dean first came to Panmunjom, it was said that he was specifically there to discuss the time and place of the political conference, but until now, he has not conducted any serious discussions on this. Regarding the location, Dean once said that other places besides Panmunjom could be considered, and he had randomly mentioned dozens of place names almost all over the world. However, after we proposed New Delhi, although he could not cite any reasons for objection, he still returned to Geneva, which we had already opposed. Regarding the time, Dean, for purely propaganda purposes, suggested holding the political conference on December 15th, and then clung to a so-called formula that the political conference should be convened within 28 to 42 days after the end of the bilateral talks. Apart from affirming that the U.S. side is deliberately trying to postpone the political conference indefinitely, it is difficult to have any other explanation for this. The spokesman finally pointed out that from the above analysis, it can be seen that the U.S.'s so-called "seventeen-point proposal" is nothing but a deception. If the U.S. government and its negotiating representatives think that such a deception can conceal their conspiracy to delay the bilateral talks, or can win the trust of the Korean-Chinese side and the people of the world, then they have completely lost their sense of political reality. It must be solemnly pointed out that because the U.S. side has consistently refused to show sincerity in the current talks, the bilateral talks are in a serious crisis. The U.S. side's attitude in Panmunjom is inseparable from the U.S.'s plan to frantically create tension around the world, especially in the East. The United States is clearly afraid that the early convening of the political conference may ease the tense situation in the world, especially in the East, and is particularly afraid that the early convening of the political conference will hinder the realization of its conspiracy to forcibly detain our captured personnel. Therefore, it is doing everything possible to obstruct the progress of the bilateral talks. The Korean-Chinese side, together with peace-loving people all over the world, will never allow the U.S.'s conspiracy to succeed. We solemnly warn the U.S. side to immediately abandon its absurd proposals, return to the comprehensive proposal put forward by the Korean-Chinese side on November 30th, conduct serious discussions, and seek a reasonable solution. Any rogue tactics can only make peace-loving people more aware of the U.S.'s sinister intentions. The U.S. side must bear the responsibility for delaying the political conference and undermining the cause of peace.

    参加关于政治会议问题会谈的我方代表团发言人
    评论美方提出的所谓十七点建议
    拆穿美方掩饰它拖延双方会谈的骗局
     【新华社开城十日电】参加关于政治会议问题双方会谈的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国代表团发言人，今日评论美方在八日提出的“十七点建议”称：空洞无物，没有答复朝中方面十一月三十日关于政治会议的全面建议所提出的关键问题，就是美方十七点建议的主要特色。
    美方无非是感到它的各项无理主张在朝中方面的坚决反对下已无法再在板门店与全世界兜售，才穷极无聊地把它们拼拼凑凑，改头换面，想拿来与我方的全面建议相对抗，以混淆世人视听。但是人们不论怎么看，都不能在其中发现多少建设性的东西。不但如此，在若干关键问题上甚至比美方自己过去所表示过的还要坏。因此这个“建议”只是美方拖延谈判的老手法的重演。世界爱好和平的人民不能不对此提高警惕。
    发言人具体分析美方这个“十七点建议”说，举世周知，板门店曾谈所以不能取得进展，其主要障碍就在于美方一贯顽固地拒绝朝中方面所提邀请中立国参加政治会议，并发挥其积极作用的建议。朝中方面曾经一再指出，中立国有权对双方同意的议程进行充分讨论，为政治会议顺利进行以获致协议所必需。并且具体提出苏联、印度、印度尼西亚、巴基斯坦、缅甸为参加政治会议的五个中立国。这个建议已受到世界舆论的普遍欢迎，被认为是促成政治会议召开的重大行动。但是美方在其“建议”中仍然对此采取规避反对的态度。这就表明了美方目前没有安下什么好心，想满足世界人民的要求与我方达成协议。
    发言人指出，美方在板门店会谈中最荒谬的一个论点就是无理否认苏联的中立性，而硬要苏联作为我方之一员来参加政治会议。对此，我方已经多次正告美方，这种胡说不仅完全无视苏联在朝鲜战争中始终严格保守中立，并一贯倡议和平解决朝鲜问题的历史事实，而且推翻了停战协定三十七款关于中立国的定义。我方坚决反对，这是我方不可更改的立场。但是美方在其建议中仍然坚持这一早已破产的谬论。美方甚至不惜自相矛盾，一方面把苏联列于双方之外，一方面又要苏联同交战国一样参加表决。如果美方不是意在拖延争端，何至如此无理取闹？发言人接着评论美方建议中所谓“凡其国民现在正在朝鲜担负工作，或在朝鲜有当前经验，并对朝鲜的问题现在是熟悉的某些或所有的政府，由双方邀请出席参加政治会议”一语说，在这里，美方显然是不敢正面拒绝我方所提议邀请的五个中立国，因此只好以这种暧昧的文字来敷衍搪塞。如果说美方过去至少已曾在表面上同意有邀请中立国参加政治会议的必要，那么，现在实际上是把邀请中立国参加政治会议的问题搁置起来，不加解决。这不仅是倒退一步，而且简直是故设骗局。
    关于中立国在政治会议中的权限问题，发言人指出：美方在其“建议”中，不仅继续坚持它过去所主张的各项无理限制，而且还增加了一项新的限制，即所谓“不得提出正式动议或建议”。发言人问道：“如果中立国的建议是有助于停战双方达成协议的，是有助于和平解决朝鲜问题的，为什么不能提出？”美方虽然慑于朝中方面的正义主张而不敢不同意邀请中立国，却仍然千方百计想把中立国的作用削弱缩小以至化为乌有。我们正告美方，这些侮辱性的条件是朝中方面所不能同意的，也是任何一个有自尊心的中立国所无法接受的。
    发言人指出：在表决程序方面，美方仍然不肯放弃它那所谓“单位投票”办法，不过这回没有这样明白，而说成“对于决定表示同意或不同意之方式，由每方定出其本身之程序”。朝中代表已经明白揭穿过所谓“单位投票”，只是美方准备为本方成员背信弃义的行为预留地步的诡计。在今年夏天的停战谈判中，美方代表哈利逊在中立国遣返委员会的职权范围上签字的墨迹未干，李承晚匪帮就假“释放”之名，强迫扣留了我方二万七千名被俘人员。这是美方无可抵赖的历史事实。就在目前美方刚一表示可以邀请“某些……”国家参加政治会议，李承晚匪帮就又大吵大闹，表示反对。试问美国究竟有什么东西可以保证它所单独签字的空头支票能为它代表的十七国完全兑现？发言人接着指出，“十七点建议”妄想规定双方会谈根本不要为政治会议决定议程，而留待政治会议自己去决定。仅仅在一天以前，美方代表在我方质问下，曾不得不承认我方“所建议的议程前三项是符合于停战协定和有关战俘的职权范围的，是必须在政治会议中处理的问题”。现在忽然又把全部议程都赖得干干净净。美方的用意显然是为了要推翻停战协定关于政治会议议程的规定，是为了要使政治会议从一开始就陷入对议程问题的争吵中，使战俘问题无法及时讨论，使中立国不能一开始就参加政治会议，这难道还有什么怀疑吗？
    关于政治会议的行政安排方面，发言人指出，美方建议中有一个绝大的笑话。人人都知道美国是打着联合国的旗号来发动侵朝战争的。美国自称代表联合国，而朝中方面在联合国中则并无代表。然而美方现在竟妄想要我方接受联合国的秘书机构供政治会议之用，以替代我方建议双方共同组织的联合秘书处。不但如此，美方甚至还要求双方代表与联合国秘书长指派的代表共同商定政治会议的议事规则及其他有关的行政与程序事项，企图改变双方在决定这些事项上的平等权利，这些当然根本不能被认为是认真的建议，而只能付之一笑。发言人又指出，美国代表迪安最初来板门店的时候，据说就是专为讨论政治会议的时间与地点来的，然而直到现在，他都没有对此进行任何认真的讨论。论地点，迪安曾经表示除板门店以外的其他地方都可以考虑，而且曾经胡乱提了几乎遍及全世界的几十个地名。然而等我方提出新德里以后，他虽然举不出任何反对的理由，却依然回到了早已受到我方反对的日内瓦。论时间，迪安从纯粹为宣传目的而建议在十二月十五日开政治会议，一转而死抱住一个所谓政治会议应在双方会谈结束后二十八天到四十二天内召开的公式。对于这一点，除了肯定美方蓄意要把政治会议无限期拖延下去而外，很难有别的解释。发言人最后指出，从以上的分析可以看出，美方的所谓“十七点建议”不过是一个骗局。美国政府及其谈判代表如果以为这样的骗局就可以掩饰了自己拖延双方会谈的阴谋，或者可以骗取了朝中方面与世界人民的信任，那就是完全丧失了政治现实感。必须郑重指出，由于美方在目前的会谈中始终拒绝表示诚意，双方会谈已处在严重的危机之中。美方在板门店的这种态度，是与美国正在全世界特别是在东方疯狂制造紧张局势的计划分不开的。美国显然恐惧政治会议的早日召开，可能使世界特别是东方紧张局势趋于缓和，特别是害怕政治会议的早日召开，会妨碍其强迫扣留我方被俘人员阴谋的实现。因此，正在尽一切力量想阻挠双方会谈取得进展。朝中方面与全世界爱好和平人民在一起，决不能容许美国的这种阴谋得逞。我们郑重警告美方立即放弃自己的荒谬建议，回到朝中方面十一月三十日提的全面建议上来，进行认真的讨论，谋取合理的解决。任何撒赖的手段都只能使爱好和平的人民更加认清美方的罪恶目的。美方必须负起拖延政治会议与破坏和平事业的责任。
