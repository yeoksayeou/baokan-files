Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd:

The CCP Central Committee North China Bureau has issued instructions on strengthening the regular education work of rural branches. The full text is as follows:

In recent years, Party organizations in North China have mainly conducted education for rural branch members through centralized training and general training during the winter slack season. The past education efforts have achieved considerable success in improving the political and ideological awareness of Party members and promoting rural production and various tasks. However, these educational efforts have been largely characterized by their sporadic nature. Because they are not followed up with regular education, the results often cannot be consolidated and sustained. The Party's line of socialist transformation of agriculture also requires us to continuously educate rural Party members as national construction and rural work develop, so as to improve their political consciousness and lead the broad masses of peasants to advance in the direction guided by the Party. This task cannot be fully shouldered by sporadic education alone. Since North China began large-scale centralized Party rectification in the winter of 1951, many regions have relaxed regular education for branch members. As a result, many branches have experienced problems again within a few months after rectification, requiring re-rectification. The facts of the past few years have proven that it is entirely necessary and highly effective to periodically conduct rectification and training for branch members to centrally address certain serious negative tendencies within the Party. However, it is also ineffective to not conduct education at ordinary times, attempt to completely solve problems in a single rectification, and then fail to conduct regular education after rectification to consolidate and improve.

The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have clearly instructed us that the Party's general line during the transition period is to basically realize the socialist industrialization of the country and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce over a considerable period of time. To realize the socialist transformation of agriculture, our rural Party members must first of all support socialism and be good at leading the peasant masses to gradually implement this socialist transformation together. Therefore, greatly strengthening the political education of rural Party members is one of the Party's extremely important tasks. The tendency to neglect this work cannot be tolerated and must be resolutely corrected.

It must be pointed out that neglecting the regular education of branch members is not entirely because of the large amount and busyness of rural work. It is mainly because Party committees, especially county and district Party committees, do not care about Party affairs work, do not understand the significance of political and ideological education work for branch members, and do not understand that the task of Party organizational work is first and foremost to manage the Party well and use the Party to promote all work. Therefore, when leading rural work, they do not first rely on the Party to carry out the work, do not conduct Party education for branch members, and do not clearly explain tasks and policies to make them consciously and actively engage in activities among the masses. Instead, they only convene mass "all-inclusive" meetings, treating Party members the same as the masses. Or, when convening branch meetings, they mostly only simply require Party members to take the lead. When work is not done well, they do not first conduct self-criticism within the Party and understand the thoughts and problems of the masses through Party members. It seems that Party members have no responsibility for whether the work is done well or not. Over time, Party members do not receive Party education and supervision and it becomes difficult for them to have a higher level of awareness than the masses. Moreover, problems constantly arise in the branch without being resolved and a small number of elements even violate laws and discipline. In this way, the Party branch cannot closely connect with the masses, cannot play the role of a rural grassroots fortress, the Party's work in the countryside cannot proceed smoothly, and the leadership cannot help but be "busy" dealing with the situation. It can be seen from this that not using the method of strengthening education to promote branch members to carry out work is one of the root causes of busy and chaotic work. Improving the political and ideological awareness of branch members and enabling them to give full play to their strength is also one of the fundamental methods to overcome the busyness of a small number of cadres and ensure the successful completion of work. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the education of rural Party members, especially to gradually establish and strengthen the regular education work of rural branches. The idea and practice of not being able to ignore other work, but only the Party branch education, is wrong.

Many rural branches in North China have branch instructors and dissemination stations, and also have education systems. Some regions already have experience in conducting regular branch education (this typical experience must be summarized and promoted). This experience proves that establishing regular education in branches is entirely possible. As for some regions that have not yet established a regular education system, or have a system but cannot maintain it, or have persisted in the education system but the quality of education is low and the effect is not significant, all of these are mainly due to insufficient understanding and attention to the significance of regular education for branch members. The low quality of branch education is a fact, but as long as the leadership provides concrete assistance, it is entirely possible for most regions to regularize branch education and gradually improve the quality of education.

In view of the above needs and possibilities, Party committees at all levels, especially county and district Party committees, must resolutely overcome the phenomenon of the Party not managing Party education and regard the political and ideological education of branch members as one of the regular businesses of Party affairs work, strengthen the leadership of branch education work, and ensure the regular conduct of branch education. To this end, the "Plan for Regular Education Work of Rural Branches in North China Region from November 1953 to October 1954" is issued to you. Please study and discuss it and submit your own region's specific implementation plan to the North China Bureau.

### 中共中央华北局发出指示  加强农村支部经常教育工作

    中共中央华北局发出指示
    加强农村支部经常教育工作
    【新华社三日讯】中共中央华北局发出关于加强农村支部经常教育工作的指示。全文如下：
    华北各地党的组织，近几年来对于农村支部党员的教育，主要是在每年冬闲季节，采用集训和普训的方式进行。历次教育对于提高党员政治思想觉悟，推进农村生产及各项工作，均有相当成绩。但这些教育带有很大的突击性，由于不能继之以经常教育，其成果往往不能巩固持久。而党的对农业实行社会主义改造的路线，也要求我们随着国家建设和农村工作的发展，不断地向农村党员进行教育，提高他们的政治觉悟，以带动广大农民群众向党所指引的方向前进。这个任务也显然不是突击性的教育所能完全担负的。一九五一年冬华北开始进行大规模的集中整党以来，很多地区反而放松了对支部党员的经常教育，致使许多支部经过整党，几个月后就又发生问题，还需重整。几年来的事实证明，为了集中解决党内的某些严重不良倾向，定期地对支部党员进行整训，是完全必要的，而且效果是很大的；但是平时不进行教育，只企图在一次整训中完全解决问题，整训后又不进行经常的教育以求巩固和提高，事实证明也是不行的。
    党中央和毛主席明确地指示我们：党在过渡时期的总路线，就是要在相当长的时期内，基本上实现国家的社会主义工业化，和国家对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。而要实现农业的社会主义改造，我们的农村党员就首先必须是拥护社会主义的，并且善于带动农民群众一齐来逐步实行这个社会主义改造。因此，大大加强对农村党员的政治教育工作，就是党的极其重要的任务之一，忽视这一工作的倾向，是不能容许的，必须坚决加以纠正。
    必须指出：忽视对支部党员的经常教育，并不完全是因为农村工作多、工作忙；主要是因为党委机关，特别是县、区党委不关心党务工作，不了解对支部党员的政治思想教育工作的意义，不了解党的组织工作任务首先是管好党，经过党来推动一切工作。因之对乡村工作的领导，不知道首先依靠党来进行工作，不是向支部党员进行党的教育，交代清楚任务和政策，使他们自觉地积极地在群众中活动，而是只召开群众性的一揽子会议，把党员降低到和群众一样看待；或者召开支部会议，也多是只单纯要求党员带头。工作做不好时，也不先在党内检查，并经过党员来了解群众的思想和问题，似乎工作做得好不好，党员都没有责任。这样时间长了，党员得不到党的教育和监督，不仅很难有比群众更高的觉悟，而且支部中不断发生问题得不到解决，少数分子甚至违法乱纪；这样，党的支部就不能密切联系群众，不能发挥农村基层堡垒的作用，党在农村中的工作就不能顺利地进行，领导上也就不能不“忙”于应付了。由此可见，不用加强教育的方法来推动支部党员进行工作，实是工作忙乱的根本原因之一；而提高支部党员的政治思想觉悟，使他们充分发挥力量，也是克服少数干部忙乱，保证工作胜利完成的根本方法之一。因此必须加强对农村党员的教育，特别是要逐步建立和加强农村支部的经常的教育工作。那种其他工作都不能不管、惟独党的支部教育可以不管的想法和做法，是错误的。
    华北各地农村支部，多设有支部教员和传授站，也规定有教育制度，并且在一部分地区已经有了进行经常支部教育的经验（这种典型经验须加总结和推广），这些经验证明建立支部的经常教育，是完全有条件的。至于有些地区还没有建立经常教育的制度，或虽有制度而不能坚持，或虽坚持了教育制度，但教育质量低，效果不大。所有这些，主要是由于对支部党员经常教育的意义认识不足、重视不够的原故。支部教育质量低是事实，但是只要领导上给以具体的帮助，绝大部分地区支部教育的经常化和逐渐提高教育质量，是完全可能的。
    鉴于上述需要与可能，各级党委，特别是县、区党委，必须坚决克服党不管党的教育现象，把对支部党员的政治思想教育当做党务工作的经常业务之一，加强对支部教育工作的领导，保证支部教育的经常进行。为此，特将“华北区一九五三年十一月到一九五四年十月关于农村支部经常教育工作的计划”发给你们，请你们研究讨论后，提出自己地区具体执行的计划方案，报告华北局。
                    一九五三年九月十五日
