    Central Higher Education Ministry, Central Education Ministry, and Chinese Academy of Sciences
    Launch Study of the General Line for the Transition Period
    The study of the general line for the transition period by cadres and staff of the Central Higher Education Ministry and the Central Education Ministry has been gradually deepening.
    The Central Higher Education Ministry began organizing all cadres to study the general line for the transition period at the beginning of November. In mid-November, the general party branch office invited Vice Minister of Higher Education Huang Songling to give a report on the study of the general line to all comrades. In the report, Vice Minister Huang Songling explained the main content and essence of the general line. Subsequently, all cadres were organized to listen to the recording of Premier Zhou Enlai's report at the Second Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers. After listening to these two reports, everyone initially realized that the general line is the guideline for all work in the country for a considerable period to come, and the starting point for considering all issues; at the same time, they realized that in order to meet the requirements of the general line, it is necessary to conduct self-examination in connection with one's own thinking, and to further draw a clear line with bourgeois ideology. Comrades who originally participated in the advanced group's theoretical study are preparing to conduct in-depth self-examination in conjunction with the Central Higher Education Ministry's 1953 work summary, and to formulate the Central Higher Education Ministry's 1954 work plan under the guidance of the general line.
    All cadres and staff of the Central People's Government's Education Ministry began studying the general line for the transition period on November 9. On November 16, Vice Minister Liu Shi gave a report on the general line for the transition period at a staff meeting; on November 19, everyone was organized to listen to the recording of Premier Zhou Enlai's report at the Second Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers. After preliminary study, the comrades realized the great significance of studying the general line, and gained a clearer understanding of the characteristics of the transition period, the Party and government's policies towards the bourgeoisie and peasants, and clarified some vague and incorrect viewpoints. Currently, the study is gradually deepening, and many comrades have begun to examine their thinking in connection with their work. Comrades who originally participated in the advanced group's theoretical study, based on the spirit of the general line, discussed the role and position of education in the transition period, and further discussed the targets of the Central Education Ministry's five-year plan.
    In addition, the cadres and staff of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing began studying the general line and general tasks for the transition period on November 16. In mid-October, Vice President Zhang Jiafu made a report at the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute Directors' Conference on conveying the general line and general tasks for the transition period, calling on everyone to earnestly study the general line for the country during the transition period, and to formulate a 1954 plan based on the spirit of the general line, and to improve and enhance scientific research work. On November 11, the General Study Committee issued a notice requesting all staff of the Academy to earnestly study the general line, improve their thinking, and improve their work. Formal study of the documents began on the 16th. On the 20th, everyone was organized to listen to the recording of Premier Zhou Enlai's report at the Second Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers. On November 30, the General Study Committee held an enlarged meeting to summarize the learning situation of the past two weeks, discussed and studied the specific steps of learning, and decided to extend the study time to the end of February next year. Currently, the study of the general line has been widely launched throughout the Academy, and ordinary comrades have initially read the designated documents. The General Study Committee plans to organize several thematic reports during the study period.
