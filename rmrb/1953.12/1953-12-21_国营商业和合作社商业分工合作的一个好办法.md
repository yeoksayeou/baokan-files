A "Joint Decision on Delineating the Scope of Business Operations for Industrial and Handicraft Products Between State-Owned Commerce and Cooperatives," approved by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council, is an important measure for state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce to realize the general line and general task of the country's transition period. All personnel in state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce should conscientiously study this decision and implement it in their daily work.

The main tasks of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce during the country's transition period are to better serve industrial and agricultural production and the growing consumption needs of the people; to strengthen the proportion of socialist economic components in the commodity circulation sector, regulate supply and demand, stabilize the market, and resolutely fight against speculative commerce; and to actively promote the cooperativization of agriculture and handicrafts and the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce.

How can state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce better serve industrial and agricultural production and the growing consumption needs of the people? On the one hand, it is necessary to vigorously promote the sales of industrial and agricultural products and actively influence production according to market needs, striving to produce consumer goods according to the needs of residents; on the other hand, it is necessary to supply the living needs of urban people and the needs of industrial raw materials in a timely manner, as well as the means of production and means of subsistence needed in the vast rural areas. In the past, due to the unclear division of labor between state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce in terms of operating varieties and regions, they competed to purchase some industrial products, while failing to actively promote the sales of others; the supply of materials needed in the vast rural market was sometimes insufficient and sometimes inappropriate. It is now stipulated that the wholesale business of industrial products shall be uniformly operated by state-owned commerce, and the wholesale and retail of handicraft products shall be operated by cooperatives. This division of labor is beneficial to both production and supply and marketing work, and it is entirely necessary. As far as industrial and handicraft production is concerned, having a unified agency to wholesale and promote their products makes it easier for them to concentrate their efforts on organizing production in a planned way, avoiding the phenomenon of being busy and idle at times, and producing too much or too little at other times; it also makes it easier for them to adjust the specifications of product varieties according to the opinions of the sales departments, avoiding blindness in production. As far as state-owned commerce and cooperatives are concerned, this division of labor enables them to have certain targets for opening up sources of goods, which facilitates strengthening the planning of purchasing work; in particular, the unified organization of handicraft production by cooperatives can strengthen the leadership of handicrafts, expand handicraft production, increase sources of goods, and further strengthen the supply of means of production and means of subsistence to rural areas. Of course, appropriate division of labor is very important, but it is even more important to have good cooperation after the division of labor. Therefore, the Financial and Economic Committee has also stipulated that after state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce appropriately divide the scope of business operations and regions, state-owned commerce should first satisfy the needs of cooperatives when cooperatives purchase industrial products to meet the needs of their members, and give priority to cooperatives in the supply of fast-selling goods and goods in short supply, and give cooperatives preferential treatment in terms of prices. State-owned commerce and cooperatives in all regions must earnestly implement these regulations in order to better serve industrial and agricultural production and the needs of the people.

This kind of division of labor and cooperation between state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce is also conducive to increasing the proportion of the socialist economy in the field of commodity circulation and strengthening the leading role of state-owned commerce in the market. We know that the leading role of state-owned commerce in the market is manifested on the one hand in the fact that state-owned and cooperative commerce should continuously expand their position in the market, and on the other hand in the management of private commerce, combating speculative behavior, and stabilizing the market. In recent years, state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce have developed rapidly. In 1952, state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce accounted for more than 50 percent of the total sales of goods in the domestic market; in the eight major cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, and Xi'an, state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce accounted for about 32 percent of the total retail sales of goods in the market. State-owned commerce has gained a dominant leading position in the domestic market. However, in the past, state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce could not fully achieve unified action and close cooperation, resulting in duplication of efforts and mutual offsetting in some places, while insufficient development in other places. As a result, to a certain extent, it hindered the common development and growth of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce, and even created opportunities for illegal private merchants to disrupt the market. Now, after appropriately delineating the scope of business operations for state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce, state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce can further coordinate their actions, closely combine, and form a strong force; and this is also the material force for stabilizing prices and combating private merchant speculation. In this sense, it is also conducive to the smooth progress of national economic construction and the further consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance.

This kind of division of labor and cooperation between state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce is also conducive to promoting the development of handicrafts towards the path of production cooperation and the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce by the state. The means of production and means of subsistence currently used by our country's peasants are mostly handicraft products. Handicrafts in many places are basically produced according to the needs of local residents, especially the needs of peasants. In a considerable period of time to come, handicraft production will still be the main supplier of means of production and means of subsistence for the vast number of peasants. However, handicraft producers generally have small capital, low output, and great blindness in production. In the past, cooperative commerce was also not active enough in organizing handicraft production. Now, it is stipulated that cooperative commerce should concentrate its main efforts on strengthening the organization of handicraft production, actively supplying them with raw materials, and promoting the sales of their products. This can further tap the potential of handicraft production, organize them to carry out production in a planned way, and promote the cooperation of handicraft production. As for private industry, in recent years, the state has gradually expanded the scope of processing and ordering, so that many private industries have gradually been brought into the orbit of state capitalism. However, due to the lack of unified leadership in the organization of sources of goods by state-owned commerce, cooperative commerce, and other parties to private industry, there is a phenomenon of multiple and scattered efforts. This is not only unfavorable to the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce by the state, but also gives lawless capitalists an opportunity to engage in speculative and disruptive activities. Now it is stipulated that state-owned commerce should expand the scope of processing and ordering and purchasing and sales from private industry in a planned and step-by-step manner. This can not only further tap the production potential of private industry to supplement the deficiencies in the development of state-owned industry, but also promote the development of private industry towards the path of state capitalism, which is conducive to the state's socialist transformation of private industry; at the same time, state-owned commerce's control of a large amount of materials is also conducive to the state's supervision of private commerce's sale in accordance with retail prices and the realization of the socialist transformation of private commerce through measures such as wholesale purchases and agency sales.

This kind of division of labor and cooperation between state-owned commerce and cooperatives is also conducive to improving their management and operation. In order to achieve the above-mentioned major tasks, state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce must also strive to improve their own management and operation. In the past, state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce were two sets of industrial product wholesale institutions and two sets of manpower, resulting in great waste of manpower, material resources, and transportation capacity, and great losses of commodities. In particular, some cooperative commerce, because of its small scale of operation and the dispersion of grassroots societies, has more small-lot consignment of goods and more transfer links, so the commodity turnover of cooperative commerce has one or two more links than that of state-owned commerce, and the transportation and miscellaneous expenses are higher, which greatly increases the commodity turnover expenses and increases the burden on consumers. Now, because state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce have appropriately divided the scope of business operations, and industrial products are uniformly purchased and transferred by state-owned commerce, and county federations and grassroots societies directly purchase goods from local state-owned commerce, the links in commodity circulation are reduced, which can avoid the duplication of two sets of wholesale institutions, save manpower, material resources, transportation capacity, and commodity losses, and accelerate commodity circulation; in addition, because cooperative commerce has reduced the wholesale business of industrial products, it can concentrate its efforts to improve the management and operation of retail business, strengthen the investigation of the needs of rural residents, and improve the quality of service for the needs of peasants. At the same time, state-owned commerce can also understand the needs of rural residents through cooperative commerce and improve the supply of materials to rural areas. Therefore, this is very beneficial to the improvement of management and operation of both state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce.

The "Joint Decision on Delineating the Scope of Business Operations for Industrial and Handicraft Products Between State-Owned Commerce and Cooperatives," approved by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council, has great political and economic significance. Correctly implementing this decision can further close the relationship between state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce, develop and grow together, and better serve the great cause of socialist transformation of our national economy.

### 国营商业和合作社商业分工合作的一个好办法

    国营商业和合作社商业分工合作的一个好办法
    中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会批准的“关于划分国营商业与合作社对工业品、手工业品经营范围的共同决定”，是国营商业和合作社商业为实现国家过渡时期总路线和总任务的一个重要措施。国营商业和合作社商业的全体工作人员，应认真地学习这个决定，并在日常工作中贯彻这个决定。
    国家过渡时期中国营商业和合作社商业的主要任务，就是更好地为工农业生产和日益增长的人民消费需要服务；壮大社会主义经济成分在商品流通领域中的比重，调剂供求，稳定市场，坚决地向投机商业进行斗争；积极推动农业和手工业的合作化及对私营工商业的社会主义改造。
    国营商业和合作社商业怎样才能更好地为工农业生产和日益增长的人民消费需要服务呢？一方面，就是要努力推销工农业的产品，并根据市场的需要去积极影响生产，争取按照居民的需要生产消费品；另一方面，就是要适合时宜地供应城市人民的生活需要和工业原料的需要，以及广大农村所需要的生产资料和生活资料。过去，由于国营商业和合作社商业在经营品种和地区上分工不明确，以致对有些工业产品竞相进货，对有些工业产品却不积极推销；对广大农村市场所需要的物资，有的供应不足，有的供应不适当。现在规定：工业品的批发业务统一由国营商业经营，手工业品的批发和零售由合作社经营。这种分工，对生产和供销工作都是有利的，是完全必要的。就工业和手工业的生产来说，它们的产品有了统一的代为批发推销的机构，这就便于他们集中精力有计划地组织生产，避免时忙时闲，时多时少的现象；也便于他们根据推销部门的意见，调剂产品品种的规格，避免生产的盲目性。就国营商业和合作社来说，这种分工使它们在开辟货源方面各有一定的对象，这就便于加强采购工作的计划性；特别是由合作社统一组织手工业品的生产，就可以加强对手工业的领导，扩大手工业生产，增加货源，进一步加强对农村的生产资料和生活资料的供应。当然，适当的分工是很重要的，而分工后又能很好协作，则更重要。因此，财经委员会又规定了国营商业和合作社商业在经营商品范围和地区上适当分工后，凡合作社商业为满足社员需要而购进工业品时，国营商业应当首先满足合作社的需要，畅销货和供不应求的货物，必须尽先照顾合作社商业的需要，并切实在价格上给合作社以优待。各地国营商业和合作社必须认真执行这些规定，才能更好地为工农业生产和人民需要服务。
    国营商业和合作社商业的这种分工合作，也有利于壮大社会主义经济在商品流转领域中的比重，加强国营商业在市场上的领导作用。我们知道，国营商业在市场上的领导作用，一方面表现在国营与合作社商业应该不断扩大在市场上的阵地，另一方面则表现在对私营商业的管理，打击投机行为，稳定市场。几年来国营商业和合作社商业有了迅速发展，一九五二年国内市场商品销售总额中，国营商业和合作社商业约占百分之五十以上；北京、天津、沈阳、上海、武汉、广州、重庆、西安等八大城市的市场商品零售总额中，国营商业和合作社商业约占百分之三十二。国营商业在国内市场上已取得了优势的领导地位。但过去由于国营商业和合作社商业还不能充分做到步调一致，紧密配合，有些地方力量重复，互相抵消；有些地方则又发展不足。结果，在一定程度上，妨碍了国营商业和合作社商业的共同发展和壮大，甚至给不法私商造成破坏市场的机会。现在，适当地划分国营商业和合作社商业的经营范围后，国营商业和合作社商业就可进一步协调动作，紧密结合，结成强大的力量；而这也就是稳定物价，打击私商投机的物质力量。在这种意义上来说，也有利于国家经济建设的顺利进行，和工农联盟的更加巩固。
    国营商业和合作社商业的这种分工合作，还有利于促进手工业向生产合作化的道路发展，和国家对私营工商业的社会主义改造。我国农民目前使用的生产工具与生活资料，大部分还是手工业产品。许多地方的手工业，基本上也是根据当地居民的需要特别是农民的需要而生产的，今后一个相当长的时期内，手工业生产也将仍然是广大农民生产资料和生活资料的主要供应者。但手工业者一般的是资金小，产量低，生产的盲目性很大。过去合作社商业对组织手工业生产也不够积极。现在，规定了合作社商业集中主要力量加强组织手工业生产，积极供应他们原料，推销他们的产品，这就可以进一步发挥手工业生产的潜力，组织它们有计划地进行生产，促进手工业生产的合作化。至于对私营工业，几年来由于国家逐渐扩大加工订货范围，使不少的私营工业逐步纳入了国家资本主义的轨道。但是由于国营商业、合作社商业以及其它方面向私营工业组织货源时候，还缺乏统一领导，存在着多头的分散现象，这既不利于国家对私营工商业的社会主义改造，也给不法资本家从事投机破坏活动以可乘之机。现在规定对私营工业应由国营商业有计划、有步骤地扩大加工订货和收购推销后，不仅可以进一步发挥私营工业的生产潜力，以补助国营工业发展的不足，并能促进私营工业向国家资本主义道路发展，有利于国家对私营工业实行社会主义的改造；同时，国营商业掌握了大批物资以后，也就有利于国家通过批购、代销等措施，监督私营商业遵照零售牌价出售，和实现对私营商业的社会主义改造。
    国营商业和合作社的这种分工合作，也有利于改进它们的经营管理工作，而为了实现上述重大任务，国营商业和合作社商业也必须努力改善自己的经营管理。过去，国营商业和合作社商业是两套工业品批发机构，两套人力，无论是人力、物力或是运输力都有极大的浪费，商品的损耗也很大。特别是一些合作社商业，由于它的经营规模较小，基层社又很分散，商品零担托运多，调拨环节多，因而合作社商业的商品流转比国营商业多一两个环节，运杂费较高，结果就大大地增加了商品的流转费用，增加了消费者的负担。现在，由于国营商业和合作社商业适当划分了经营范围，工业品统一由国营商业进货调运，县联社和基层社直接向当地国营商业进货，就减少了商品流转环节，既可避免两套批发机构的重复现象，节省人力、物力、运输力和商品损耗，又可加速商品流转；另外，由于合作社商业减少了工业品的批发业务，就能够集中力量去改善零售业务的经营管理，加强对于农村居民需要的调查，提高对农民需要服务的工作质量。同时，国营商业也可通过合作社商业了解农村居民需要，改进对农村的物资供应工作。因此，这对国营商业和合作社商业改善经营管理来说，都是很有利的。
    中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会批准的
  “关于划分国营商业与合作社对工业品、手工业品经营范围的共同决定”，是具有重大的政治意义和经济意义的。正确地贯彻这个决定，就能进一步密切国营商业和合作社商业的关系，共同发展和壮大，就能更好地为实现我国国民经济社会主义改造的伟大事业服务。
