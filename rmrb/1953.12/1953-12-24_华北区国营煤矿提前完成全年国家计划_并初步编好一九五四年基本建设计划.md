    State-Owned Coal Mines in North China Region Fulfill National Plan Ahead of Schedule
    And Preliminarily Compile Basic Construction Plan for 1954
    [Report from this newspaper] State-owned coal mines in the North China region exceeded the annual national production plan by thirteen days, completing it on December 18. Specifically, Kailuan Mining Bureau completed 98.56 percent of its plan; Datong Mining Bureau completed 100.28 percent; Fengfeng Mining Bureau completed 103.31 percent; Yangquan Mining Bureau completed 104.44 percent; Jingxing Mining Bureau completed 98.42 percent; Jingsi Mining Bureau completed 99.23 percent; and Luan Coal Mine completed 104.51 percent. Various state-owned coal mines are striving to complete this year's production increase and savings plan two days ahead of schedule, increasing raw coal production for the country by more than 500,000 tons and saving more than 100 billion yuan.
    In the second half of this year, state-owned coal mines in the North China region strengthened planning management, promoted operational plans, and each bureau and mine established a dispatch room, implemented a production dispatch system, and strengthened leadership over tunneling work, gradually reversing the situation in the first half of the year when the plan could not be completed. Starting in September, state-owned coal mines throughout the region launched a production increase and savings competition, and all employees demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity, with production efficiency increasing month by month. In order to reduce heavy manual labor and further improve production efficiency, various bureaus and mines in the North China region also vigorously promoted mechanized coal mining. The degree of mechanized coal mining in state-owned coal mines throughout the region has increased year by year. For example, taking 1950 as 100, this year it reached 700. Due to the increase in the degree of mechanization, production efficiency this year increased by 125.5 percent compared to 1950, which played a significant role in ensuring the early completion of this year's production tasks.

    The basic construction plan for coal mines in the North China region for 1954 has been preliminarily compiled. This plan will, on the one hand, fully explore the potential capacity of existing mines, and on the other hand, actively prepare for the construction of new large-scale mines to meet the needs of the ever-increasing industrial coal consumption.
    The coal reserves in the North China region rank first in the country, and the output ranks second, and it is also the main producing area of coking coal. In the national construction, the coal output of state-owned coal mines in the North China region must grow rapidly in order to meet the needs of the ever-developing industrial coal consumption. At present, the output of each mine is generally close to the capacity of existing mine equipment. If we rely entirely on the construction of new mines to increase production, coal can only be produced in five or six years, which is too late, and at the same time requires a large amount of investment. Therefore, when preparing the plan, the North China Coal Mine Administration carefully studied effective ways to use investment to quickly produce a large amount of coal and decided to concentrate most of the investment on renovating existing mines, restoring old mines, and building small new mines. In this way, a large amount of coal can be produced in a relatively short period of time with only a small amount of investment. For example, after a certain coal mine undergoes renovation projects next year, including digging three ventilation shafts, one transportation shaft, and two dark shafts, and adding some coal mining and tunneling machinery, it will be able to produce 3.5 million tons of coal more in 1955 than in 1953, which is equivalent to the quantity produced by four pairs of large new mines that would take five or six years to build, and the investment required is less than one-eighth of that required to build new mines. Three mines are planned to be restored next year. These three mines will be able to partially produce coal in 1955 and will be fully restored in 1956. The total output after restoration is equivalent to one-fifth of the planned output of state-owned coal mines in the North China region in 1953. Next year, the North China region will also build four pairs of small inclined shafts with an annual output of 200,000 to 300,000 tons of coal. These small inclined shafts can begin partial production in 1955 and can all produce coal in 1956. The construction of these small inclined shafts can not only produce coal quickly but also use less capital to utilize shallow coalfields and small coalfields.
    While renovating and restoring existing mines, the North China region is also actively preparing for the construction of new large-scale mines producing coking coal to meet the needs of developing the iron and steel industry in the second five-year plan. In 1954, the North China Coal Mine Administration will use four times the number of drilling rigs at the beginning of 1953 to explore for coking coal in some old mining areas and several new areas. Several areas that have already begun exploration this year are expected to be able to provide preliminary design data for mine construction after continued exploration next year, and new mines can be started in 1955. In order to prepare forces for new mine construction, the North China Coal Mine Administration will establish a well-drilling engineering company next year.
    Currently, the North China Coal Mine Administration and the North China Geological Bureau are actively carrying out various preparations for the implementation of next year's basic construction plan. The North China Coal Mine Administration is allocating cadres and establishing new mine management offices and geological exploration companies. At present, cadres at the section chief level and above have been basically assigned. Design personnel from various mines began designing the projects to be constructed in the first quarter of next year in early December. The drilling designs for areas that have already been geologically surveyed this year will be completed by the end of December. More than 80 percent of the mechanical equipment to be added to various mines next year has already signed purchase contracts. Seventy percent of the orders for drilling rig accessories can be received in the first quarter of next year. The North China Geological Bureau is now preparing cadres and materials for new exploration areas. The Ministry of Geology of the Central People's Government and the leading organs of the North China region are currently transferring cadres, geologists, and workers from various places to replenish the various exploration teams. Some of the newly arrived personnel have been sent to the construction sites of existing exploration teams for internships. More than 1,000 tons of materials used by a certain exploration team will be transported to the exploration area more than 1,000 miles away through the frozen Yellow River and desert areas in winter.

    华北区国营煤矿提前完成全年国家计划
    并初步编好一九五四年基本建设计划
    【本报讯】华北区国营煤矿在十二月十八日提前十三天超额完成了全年国家生产计划。计开滦矿务局完成计划百分之九十八点五六；大同矿务局完成计划百分之一百点二八，峰峰矿务局完成计划百分之一百零三点三一，阳泉矿务局完成计划百分之一百零四点四四，井陉矿务局完成计划百分之九十八点四二，京西矿务局完成计划百分之九十九点二三，潞安煤矿完成计划百分之一百零四点五一。各国营煤矿正争取提前两天完成今年的增产节约计划，为国家增产原煤五十余万吨，节约一千余亿元。
    华北区各国营煤矿今年下半年加强了计划管理，推行了作业计划，各局、矿并建立了调度室，实行生产调度制，加强了对掘进工作的领导，逐步扭转了上半年不能完成计划的局面。九月份开始，全区国营煤矿又开展了增产节约竞赛，全体职工发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，生产效率逐月提高。为减轻笨重的体力劳动和进一步提高生产效率，华北区各局、矿还大力推行了机械化采煤。全区国营煤矿实行机械化采煤的程度逐年提高，如以一九五○年为一百，今年达到了七百。由于机械化程度的提高，今年比一九五○年的生产效率提高了百分之一百二十五点五，这对保证提前完成今年生产任务起了很大的作用。
    【新华社二十三日讯】华北区一九五四年的煤矿基本建设计划已经初步编好。这一计划一方面将充分发掘现有矿井的潜在能力，另方面又积极准备建设新的大型矿井，以供应不断增长的工业用煤的需要。
    华北区煤的储藏量为全国第一，产量占全国第二位，又是炼焦煤的主要产地。在国家建设中，华北区国营煤矿的煤产量必须迅速增长，才能满足日益发展的工业用煤需要。而目前各矿的产量，一般已接近现有矿井设备的能力。如果完全依靠建设新井增产，在五六年之后才能出煤，时间赶不上，同时需要大量的投资。因此，华北煤矿管理局在编制计划时，周密地研究出有效使用投资以迅速生产大量煤炭的办法，决定把大部分投资集中用于改建现有矿井、恢复旧矿井和建设小型新井。这样，只要少量的投资，在较短的时间内就可以生产出大量的煤炭。如某煤矿经过明年打三个通风井、一个交通井，两个暗井和增添一些采煤和掘进机械的改建工程后，一九五五年就可以比一九五三年多产三百五十万吨煤，相当于需要五六年时间才能建成的四对大型新井所生产的数量，而所花的投资还不到建设新井的八分之一。明年计划恢复的矿井有三处。这三处矿井在一九五五年就可以部分产煤，一九五六年可以全部恢复，恢复后的总产量相当于华北全区国营煤矿一九五三年计划产量的五分之一。明年，华北区还将建设四对年产二三十万吨煤的小斜井。这些小斜井在一九五五年就可以开始部分生产，一九五六年可以全部出煤。这些小斜井的建设既可以很快出煤，又可以用较少的资金利用浅部煤田和小煤田。
    华北区在改建、恢复现有矿井的同时，还积极为建设新的生产炼焦煤的大型矿井做好准备，以适应第二个五年计划中发展钢铁工业的需要。华北煤矿管理局一九五四年将用等于一九五三年年初四倍的钻探机，在一些旧有矿区和若干新地区勘探炼焦煤。有几处在今年已经开始勘探的地区，预计经过明年的继续勘探，就可提出矿井建设的初步设计资料，一九五五年可以开始建设新井。为了给新井建设准备力量，华北煤矿管理局将在明年建立打井工程公司。
    现在，华北煤矿管理局和华北地质局正积极进行为实现明年基本建设计划的各项准备工作。华北煤矿管理局正在调配干部，成立新井管理处和地质勘探公司。目前科长级以上的干部已基本配齐。各矿的设计人员从十二月初就已开始设计明年第一季度施工的工程。今年已经地质调查的地区的钻探设计，十二月底即可作好。各矿明年增添的机械设备，已有百分之八十以上签订了订货合同。百分之七十的钻机配件的订货在明年第一季度就可收到。华北地质局现在正为新的勘探区准备干部和物资。中央人民政府地质部和华北区领导机关现正从各地抽调干部、地质人员和工人，充实各勘探队。新来的人员，部分已被派往现有勘探队的工地实习。某勘探队所用的一千多吨物资，将在冬季通过冰封的黄河和沙漠地带，运往远在一千多里外的勘探地区。
