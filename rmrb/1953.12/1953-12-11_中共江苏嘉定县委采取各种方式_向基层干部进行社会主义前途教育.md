The CCP Jiading County Committee in Jiangsu Province Adopts Various Methods to Conduct Socialist Future Education for Grassroots Cadres

The CCP Jiading County Committee in Jiangsu Province convened a county-wide meeting of district, township, and village cadres in November. They employed methods such as enlightenment, guidance, recollection, and comparison to conduct education on the general line, which proved to be effective.

Before the conclusion of the Provincial Party Committee of Jiangsu’s meeting of party member cadres, the county had already convened a meeting of county committee members and township branch secretaries. They deeply discussed the Party's general line during the transition period, enabling everyone to basically understand the spirit and essence of the general line and general task. This prepared a batch of key and core personnel for the expanded cadre meeting. After the meeting, the county convened an expanded cadre meeting on November 17. More than 1,300 district, township, and village cadres and more than 600 government cadres from across the county participated. At the meeting, they listened to the report by County Party Secretary Pan Linru on the general line and general task of the state during the transition period. He vividly and accessibly explained the content of the general line in connection with the specific situation of Jiading County and guided all cadres to repeat and discuss it.

At the beginning of the meeting, most of the cadres lacked an understanding of the tasks of the current revolutionary struggle, believing that socialist construction was a distant future matter. Wu Houli, a cadre from Fangtai Township, said: "In the past, I always felt that socialism was like a distant mountain in the mist, a vast expanse, and I couldn't see its shadow. After listening to the report on the general line, I had a lighthouse for my work, and I realized that socialism is not too far away." Dai Yufeng from Lijiang Township said: "Now, I realize that during the transition period, we are all like sitting on a ferry boat, transitioning to socialism. Chairman Mao is at the helm, and we are using poles and oars; to reach socialism, we must work hard to pole and row." Liu Amao, the mutual aid team leader from Yangdian Township, had no confidence in the mutual aid team before the meeting. After hearing the report, he said: "The transition from small-scale peasant economy to socialism cannot rely solely on hoes and iron rakes. It must be transformed through mutual aid and cooperation. I am determined to do it when I go back." Zhu Chunrong, a cadre from Xinjing Township, excitedly said to everyone: "I am already sixty-six years old this year, and I will continue to work to see socialism!"

When discussing the important significance of national industrialization, the meeting inspired the cadres to recall the past, making everyone realize the importance of industrialization in consolidating national defense. Jin Rongxiang from Gannan Township said: "In the past, we suffered a lot from Japanese imperialism, and the houses in the village were burned down; only industrialization can guarantee the safety of the country and individuals. Everyone also realized that only by developing industry can we use machines to cultivate the land and use pesticides to eliminate pests. A cadre from Malu Township said: "This year, thanks to the help of machines during the drought, otherwise, the harvest would not have been good." Cadres from Xinyang Township said: "This year, the '223' emulsion was sprayed in the cotton fields, and the pests were eliminated, with an average yield of 180 kilograms per mu." Meng Fuxing from Maqiao Township said: "This year, we achieved a bumper harvest thanks to the support of industry; in the future, we will drive tractors, which are inseparable from industry."

After the cadres clearly understood the significance and importance of industrialization, County Party Secretary Pan Linru and Deputy Secretary Mou Dungao gave reports to the cadres, using facts to compare the two roads and pointing out the road to building socialism in rural areas. They also summarized the great achievements of the country in the past four years, explained the spontaneous capitalist forces and class differentiation in rural areas and their harm. During the meeting, all cadres were organized to visit the Jiafeng Textile Factory, listened to the labor model report on their visit to the Soviet Union, and watched Soviet films such as "Happy Life" and "Virgin Soil Upturned," which further deepened their understanding of the general line.

The meeting also adopted methods such as detailed accounting, complaining, recalling, and comparing for discussion. Through the discussion, everyone unanimously realized that in the four years since liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, 130,000 farmers in Jiading County were allocated 163,000 mu of land, and the yields of major crops such as rice, wheat, and cotton have been greatly improved. For example, wheat: before liberation, the average yield per mu was only 90 kilograms, and now the yield per mu has reached 214 kilograms; the rice in Hengjing Village, Ousi Township, had a yield of 300 kilograms per mu in 1949, and the yield in 1953 was 500 kilograms. With the increase in production, the means of production have also greatly increased. For example, Ni Wenfu, a farmer in Zongjia Village, Xinyang Township, had his house burned down twice by Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and his farm implements were all destroyed; now the house has been rebuilt, and all the farm implements have been fully equipped. His mutual aid team also has windmills, rice beds, plows, sprayers, as well as cultivators and seed mixers; after the land reform in Jingquan Village, Malu Township, they bought two large boats, two waterwheels, seven sprayers, and each household increased three hoes and iron rakes; before liberation, Fangtai Township had only four rice milling machines, and after liberation, 61 were added. After the land reform, the lives of farmers have mostly risen to the level of middle peasants. Before liberation, nearly 100 farmers in Nanxiang District begged for food in the winter, sleeping on straw mats on the bottom of their beds. Now they use quilts on top and bottom, and many people have put on new clothes. Cultural and educational undertakings have also developed significantly in the past few years. The number of primary school children enrolled has more than doubled compared with before liberation; more than 20,000 farmers have participated in people's schools and winter schools, and the number of illiterate people has gradually decreased. Film projection teams, troupes, and amateur troupes also often show movies or perform for farmers.

In addition, in the past four years, in order to encourage farmers to increase production, the People's Government has issued agricultural loans of 20 billion yuan in Jiading County alone. In terms of water conservancy construction: in the more than 30 years of reactionary rule, only four rivers were repaired in the county, while in the short four years after liberation, 80 rivers were repaired, enabling this year's crops to achieve a bumper harvest under drought conditions. In terms of price policy, farmers have also benefited. For example, before liberation, farmers had to take 70 kilograms of wheat to the market to exchange for a soybean cake, now they only need 41.5 kilograms to exchange for one. A cadre from Jinghe Township said: In the past four years, farmers in Jinghe Township have bought more than 40,000 soybean cakes, each costing 18,000 yuan less, and the township has benefited 700 million yuan; if you use this 700 million yuan to buy rice, 2,000 people can eat for a year. The government has also organized mutual aid teams in rural areas to increase production.

In order to enable the cadres attending the meeting to further understand the harm of spontaneous capitalist tendencies and the instability of the small-scale peasant economy, the meeting guided everyone to recognize the serious situation of class differentiation in rural areas through discussion. For example, in Yangjialong Village, Fangtai Township, three households have sold their land in the past two years; Xu Azhao, a farmer in Yingfang Township, has also sold all five mu of land he was allocated. The phenomenon of buying land, hiring labor, and lending at usurious rates for exploitation in rural areas is also increasing. If it develops, as the cadres said, the result must be "ten years of land turning three villages" (Jiading proverb). Through recollection, everyone realized that the development result of the small-scale peasant economy is "a few people get rich, and most people suffer." Zhu Xuegui, a cadre from Jinghe Township, said: "The small-scale peasant economy is like a small boat heavily loaded, which cannot withstand the wind and waves and capsizes with a touch." Huang Yuwen, a cadre from Wangxian Township, said: "The development result of the small-scale peasant economy can only be that a few people eat fish and meat, and most people cry north and south." Zhu Liuyu, a cadre from Liuli Township, said: "Last year, my wife and I were sick, and the children were young, and no one harvested the rice in the fields. Thanks to the help of the mutual aid team, we were able to bring the rice home."

Through listening to reports, typical speeches, group discussions, and visiting factories, the cadres attending the meeting consciously checked and criticized capitalist ideological behaviors such as buying land, hoarding grain for business, renting out land, and acting as intermediaries. They expressed their determination to draw a clear ideological line, organize themselves, increase production, and live a "good life for everyone." Many leaders of mutual aid teams stated that they would go back and be determined to do a good job in mutual aid teams and cooperatives.

On the basis of the improvement of the ideological awareness of all cadres, Deputy County Head Liu Wenlu made a report on future work tasks, deployed winter work, and launched a discussion. In the discussion, many cadres accused unscrupulous merchants of speculation, hoarding, and snatching grain. For example, before liberation, Lu Ganqing, a poor peasant from Gelong Township, borrowed 100 kilograms of rice from the grain merchant You Keming. Two years later, he had to repay 2,500 kilograms, and Lu Ganqing had to mortgage three mu of land to repay the debt. After liberation, some unscrupulous merchants still engaged in speculation, hoarding, and snatching grain, disrupting grain supply work. In order to stabilize prices and ensure the smooth progress of national construction, cadres stated that they would do a good job in grain procurement work after returning to the village and mobilize farmers to sell their surplus grain to the state. Many cadres with surplus grain reported the amount of grain they would sell at the meeting. According to incomplete statistics, Loutang District alone sold more than 20,000 kilograms of grain to the state. After the meeting ended on November 28, all county cadres returned to various districts and townships to publicize the Party's general line during the transition period to farmers. Currently, all townships in Jiading County are fully launching the publicity work of the general line.

    中共江苏嘉定县委采取各种方式
    向基层干部进行社会主义前途教育
    中共江苏省嘉定县委在十一月间召开全县区、乡、村干部会议，采取启发、诱导、回忆、对比等方法，向到会干部进行了总路线教育，收效良好。
    在中共江苏省委召开的全省党员干部会议结束前，县曾召开了全县区委委员、乡支部书记会议，深入地讨论了党在过渡时期的总路线，使大家基本上弄清了总路线、总任务的精神和实质。这样就为扩大干部会议训练了一批骨干和核心力量。会议结束后于十一月十七日召开了全县扩大干部会议。参加会议的有全县一千三百多个区、乡、村干部和六百多个机关干部。会上听取了县委书记潘林儒关于国家在过渡时期总路线、总任务的报告，并结合嘉定县的具体情况，生动通俗地对总路线的内容进行了阐释，又引导全体干部进行了复述和讨论。
    会议开始时，多数到会干部对当前革命斗争的任务缺乏认识，以为社会主义建设是遥远的将来的事。方泰乡干部吴厚礼说：“以前，我总觉得，社会主义像是迷雾中的远山，白茫茫，见不到影儿。听了关于总路线的报告以后，工作有了灯塔，认识到社会主义并不是太远的。”沥江乡戴玉丰说：“现在，我认识到，在过渡时期，我们大家就好像坐在摆渡船上，过渡到社会主义去。毛主席掌着舵，我们在撑篙、划桨；要到社会主义，我们就得加劲撑篙、划桨。”杨甸乡的互助组组长刘阿毛开会前对互助组没有信心搞，听到报告后说：“小农经济要过渡到社会主义光靠锄头、铁?是不行的，一定要通过互助合作来改造，回去下决心搞。”新泾乡干部朱春荣激动地对大家说：“我今年已经活了六十六岁，还要干下去，看看社会主义！”
    讨论到国家工业化的重要意义时，会议启发干部们回忆了过去，使大家认识到工业化对巩固国防的重要性。甘南乡金荣祥说：“过去，我们吃过日本帝国主义的许多苦头，村上房子都烧掉；只有工业化，才能保障国家和个人的安全。大家又认识到：只有发展了工业，才能用机器种田，用药械消灭虫害。马陆乡的一个干部说：“今年抗旱时，亏得机器帮忙，要不，年成好不了。”新杨乡的干部说：“今年棉花田里打了‘二二三’乳剂，把虫害消灭掉，每亩平均收到一百八十斤。”马桥乡孟福兴说：“今年靠了工业的支持，得到了丰收；今后要开拖拉机，更离不开工业。”
    干部们明确认识了工业化的意义和重要性之后，县委书记潘林儒同志、副书记牟敦高同志又分别向干部们作了报告，用事实对比了两条道路，指出了农村建设社会主义的道路。并总结了过去四年来国家的伟大成就，说明了农村中资本主义自发势力和阶级分化的情况及其危害性。会议期中，还组织全体干部参观了嘉丰纺织厂，听劳动模范报告了访苏见闻，看了苏联电影“幸福的生活”和“被开垦的处女地”等影片，更加深了对总路线的认识。
    会议又采取算细账、诉苦、回忆、对比等办法进行了讨论。大家从讨论中一致认识到，解放四年来，在共产党、人民政府领导下，嘉定县十三万农民分到土地十六万三千亩，水稻、小麦、棉花等主要作物产量已有很大提高。如小麦：解放前平均每亩只产九十斤，现在每亩的产量已达到二百十四斤；讴思乡横泾村的水稻，一九四九年每亩产量为三百斤，一九五三年的产量则为五百斤。随着生产的提高，生产资料也大大增加，如新杨乡宗家村的农民倪文甫，房子两次被日寇、蒋匪烧光，农具也都被毁；现在房子修起来了，农具也全部办齐了。他的互助组里还有风车、稻床、犁耙、喷雾器，以及中耕机、拌种机；马陆乡泾圈村土地改革以后，买了大船两只，水车两部，喷雾器七部，锄头、铁?每家都增加三把；方泰乡解放前轧稻机只有四部，解放后添了六十一部。农民的生活，土地改革后大多上升到中农水平。沥江乡解放前有近百个农民讨饭，现在讨饭的一个也没有了，生活过的挺好。南翔区农民在解放前冬天床底垫草席，现在上下都用被子，很多人穿上了新衣。文化教育事业，几年来也有了显著的发展。小学入学儿童比解放前增加了一倍多；农民参加民校、冬学学习的已有二万多人，不识字的逐渐减少了。电影放映队、剧团、业余剧团也经常给农民放映电影或演出。
    另外，四年来，人民政府为了鼓励农民增产，仅嘉定县就发放了二百亿元的农业贷款。在兴修水利方面：在反动派统治的三十多年间，全县只修了四条河，而解放后短短四年中，就修了河八十条，使今年的庄稼在天旱的条件下得到了丰收。在价格政策方面，也使农民得到了好处。比如，解放前，农民要拿七十斤小麦才能在市场上换到一张大豆饼，现在只要四十一斤五两就可以换到一张。泾河乡干部说：四年来泾河乡农民共买了四万多张豆饼，每张便宜了一万八千元，全乡得益有七亿元；如果用这七亿元来买米的话，二千个人可以吃一年。政府又在农村中组织了互助组，提高了产量。
    为了使到会的干部进一步认识资本主义自发倾向的危害性和小农经济的不稳定性，会议引导大家通过讨论，认识到农村阶级分化的严重情况。如方泰乡的杨家弄村二年多以来，就有三户把田卖了；鹰房乡农民徐阿照分到的五亩土地也已全部卖光。农村中买田和雇工、放高利贷进行剥削的现象也日益增多。发展下去，正如干部们所说，结果一定是“十年田地转三村”（嘉定谚语）。通过回忆，使大家认识到小农经济发展结果是“少数人发财，多数人遭殃”。泾河乡干部朱雪桂说：“小农经济有如小船重载，经不起风浪，一碰就翻”。望仙乡干部黄裕文说：“小农经济的发展结果只能是少数人吃鱼吃肉，多数人哭南哭北。”六里乡干部朱流宇说：“去年，我们夫妻俩生了病，孩子年纪小，稻在田里没有人收，亏得互助组的帮助，才把稻收回家来。”
    通过听报告、典型发言、小组讨论、参观工厂等，到会干部自觉地检查并批判了买田、囤粮做生意、出租土地和当中人等的资本主义思想行为，表示决心划清思想界限，组织起来，提高产量，过“大家好”的生活。许多互助组的领导人表示：回去下决心搞好互助组、合作社。
    在全体干部思想觉悟提高的基础上，副县长刘文鲁作了关于今后工作任务的报告，布置了冬季工作，并展开了讨论。很多干部在讨论中，纷纷控诉奸商投机倒把、抢购粮食的罪恶。如葛隆乡贫农陆甘卿解放前向粮商尤克明借了一百斤米，过了二年，要他还二千五百斤，陆甘卿只得将三亩土地抵债。解放以后，有些奸商仍投机倒把，抢购粮食，破坏粮食供应工作。为了稳定物价，保证国家建设的顺利进行，干部们纷纷表示：回村后一定做好粮食收购工作，动员农民把余粮卖给国家。很多有余粮的干部在会上自报卖粮数，据不完全统计，仅娄塘区即卖给国家两万多斤粮食。会议于十一月二十八日结束后，全县干部即回到各区、乡向农民宣传党在过渡时期的总路线。目前，嘉定县各乡全面展开总路线的宣传工作。
