    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 20th - Korean opinion circles support the just struggle of the heroic Vietnamese people and firmly advocate ending the war of aggression against Vietnam through peaceful consultation.
    The Korean Central News Agency on the 19th rebroadcast the glorious war achievements communiqué of the Vietnamese People's Army in the seven years of the war of resistance, and President Ho Chi Minh's letter to the people of the whole country on the eve of the seventh anniversary of the nationwide resistance war in Vietnam. The agency also published a commentary saying: The Korean people congratulate the Vietnamese People's Army on the brilliant achievements it has made in the heroic struggle to resist French aggressors and American interventionists to defend national independence and freedom over the past seven years, and warmly support the resolution of the Third World Federation of Trade Unions Congress. Korea's experience proves that the war in Vietnam can also be stopped through negotiations. The Vietnamese people's seven-year resistance, as proven by Korea's experience, clearly demonstrates that the people who take up arms to fight for their country's freedom and independence are bound to win. The era of imperialism ruling the Asian people by force is gone forever.
      "Labor News" also published an editorial on the 19th saying: In every corner of the world, there is a call to stop the war of aggression against the Vietnamese people and to resolve the Vietnam issue through peaceful consultation. However, the American imperialists and a handful of ruling groups in France are frantically trying to continue this criminal war of aggression. In particular, the American imperialists, who are undermining the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, are attempting to turn Vietnam into a base for aggression against China and Southeast Asian countries, and to continue to maintain international tension. All the Korean people, together with the peace-loving people of the world, sincerely wish the Vietnamese people to achieve more brilliant results and victories in the struggle to defend national independence and peace, and are determined to further strengthen internationalist solidarity with the Vietnamese people in order to make greater contributions to the great cause of world peace.
    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 20th - Berlin Democratic District newspapers on the 19th published news, commentary and pictures about commemorating Vietnam National Resistance Day and supporting the just struggle of the Vietnamese people.
    A commentary published in "Neues Deutschland" said that the struggle of the oppressed people is inseparable from the struggle of the working class against imperialism, for democracy and peace and for socialism. Hundreds of millions of working people around the world will hold demonstrations demanding an end to the Vietnam War. For seven years, the colonialists, despite using modern American and French weapons and spending hundreds of millions of francs and dollars, have gained nothing but their own losses and casualties. The Vietnamese people's resolute and heroic struggle has continuously inflicted heavy blows on the invaders, victoriously defended their homeland, and established a new democratic life.
    The "Tribune," the organ of the Free German Trade Union Federation, devoted two pages to stories and pictures introducing the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people. The newspaper published news that factories and mines in Berlin and major cities in Democratic Germany have held gatherings in recent days to support the Vietnamese people. The Democratic Women's Federation of Germany has sent a letter to the Vietnamese Women's Federation expressing the solidarity between German and Vietnamese women.

    朝鲜舆论界声援越南人民的正义斗争
    柏林民主区各报刊载支援越南人民斗争的新闻和评论
     【新华社平壤二十日电】朝鲜舆论界声援英勇的越南人民的正义斗争，并坚决主张用和平协商方式停止对越南的侵略战争。
    朝鲜中央通讯社在十九日转播了越南人民军抗战七年来的战果辉煌的战绩公报，和胡志明主席在越南全国抗战七周年纪念日前夕发表的告全国军民书。该社并发表评论说：朝鲜人民对越南人民军七年来在反抗法国侵略者和美国干涉者以保卫民族独立和自由的英雄斗争中所取得的辉煌成果表示祝贺，并热烈支持世界工会第三次代表大会的决议。朝鲜的经验证明，越南的战争也可以用谈判方式来停止。越南人民七年来的抗战，正如朝鲜的经验所证明的一样，清楚地证明为了祖国的自由和独立拿起武器来斗争的人民是必然胜利的。帝国主义以武力统治亚洲人民的时代是一去不复返了。
      “劳动新闻”也在十九日发表社论说：全世界的每一个角落，都响起了要求停止对越南人民进行侵略战争，以和平协商的方法解决越南问题的呼声。但是，美帝国主义者和法国一小撮统治集团却疯狂地企图继续进行这个罪恶的侵略战争。特别是正在破坏朝鲜问题和平解决的美帝国主义者，企图把越南变为对中国和东南亚各国进行侵略的基地，继续维持国际的紧张局势。全体朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平人民一起，衷心地愿望越南人民在保卫民族独立与和平的斗争中取得更加光辉的成果和胜利，并决心进一步加强与越南人民的国际主义的团结，以期在世界和平的伟大事业里做出更大的贡献。
    【新华社柏林二十日电】柏林民主区各报十九日刊载了有关纪念越南全国抗战日和支援越南人民正义斗争的新闻、评论和图片。
    “新德意志报”发表的评论说，被压迫人民的斗争与工人阶级反对帝国主义、争取民主与和平和社会主义的斗争是分不开的。全世界千百万劳动人民将要举行示威，要求停止越南战争。七年来，殖民主义者尽管使用着现代化的美国和法国的武器，耗费了成千百万的法郎和美元，但除了招致本身的损失和伤亡以外毫无所得。越南人民坚决、英勇的战斗，不断地给侵略者以严重的打击，胜利地保卫了自己的家乡，建立了新的民主生活。
    自由德国工会联合会的机关报“论坛报”，以两版的篇幅刊载了介绍越南人民英勇斗争的故事和图片。该报刊载消息说，柏林及民主德国各大城市的工厂、矿山近几天来都举行了集会，声援越南人民。德国民主妇女联合会曾致函越南妇女联合会，表示德越妇女的团结一致。
