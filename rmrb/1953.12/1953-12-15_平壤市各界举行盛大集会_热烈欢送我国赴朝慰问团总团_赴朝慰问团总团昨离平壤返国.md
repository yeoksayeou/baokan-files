Women representatives from Pyongyang presented flowers to the heads of the Comfort Mission to express their respect.

The rally began with the national anthems of China and Korea.

Kim Cheon-hai, representative of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front, delivered a farewell speech first, extending heartfelt congratulations and gratitude to the Comfort Mission, to the great Chinese people and their leader Chairman Mao Zedong. He said: This visit of the Comfort Mission to Korea has further strengthened the friendship and unity between the people of our two countries, China and Korea, and has strengthened the confidence of our Korean people in victory. All of us Korean people love and respect the great Chinese people and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and will further strengthen our friendship and unity with them. We warmly welcome the joint communiqué of the China-Korea talks and the agreements on economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries, and express our boundless joy and gratitude. The great assistance and support given to us by the Chinese and Soviet people are a strong guarantee for us to complete the post-war reconstruction. Today, the American aggressors who have suffered heavy defeats have not yet abandoned their sinister aggressive schemes. We, the Korean people, will not relax our revolutionary vigilance against the enemy in the slightest, and we are determined to unite as one around the Party, the government, and Marshal Kim Il-sung, the leader, continue to consolidate and expand the great victory won by the people of China and Korea, rapidly restore and develop the post-war people's economy, and complete the peaceful reunification of the motherland, in order to repay the internationalist assistance given to us by the people of the great Soviet Union and China and the people of various people's democratic countries.

Kim Eul-kyu, representative of the Korean People's Army, then delivered a farewell speech, saying: The Chinese government, in order to assist our country's economic recovery and development, has signed an economic and cultural cooperation agreement with our country. This once again demonstrates the traditional, unbreakable friendship and unity between the people of China and Korea, and the determination of the people of China and Korea to thoroughly implement the armistice agreement and peacefully resolve the Korean issue. Although the US imperialists and their lackeys are still attempting to undermine the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, we must rapidly restore and build our cities, factories, and villages, further consolidate our fighting friendship with the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Volunteers, thoroughly smash all new conspiracies of the enemy, and gloriously defend our achievements of labor and our country's freedom and independence.

General He Long delivered a reply speech amidst warm applause (full text to be published separately).
