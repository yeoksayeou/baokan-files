Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 18th: The Korean Military Armistice Commission's Korean-Chinese delegation issued the following communique on the 18th:

    At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on December 18th, Chief Korean-Chinese delegate General Li Xiangchao sternly denounced the US side's criminal acts of forcibly detaining prisoners of war and forcibly incorporating them into US troops or US intelligence agencies.

    General Li Xiangchao pointed out: Ten days after the signing of the agreement on the issue of prisoners of war, the more than 27,000 Korean and Chinese captured personnel who had been perfidiously forcibly abducted by the US side had already been incorporated into US troops. The reason why the US side has not been able to give any responsible account of the list of 98,742 Korean and Chinese captured personnel submitted by the Korean-Chinese side about three months ago is because the vast majority of these prisoners of war have already been forcibly detained by the US side and forcibly incorporated into US troops or intelligence agencies. For example, Park Doo-hoon and Kim Jong-shik, prisoners of war of the Korean People's Army who were forcibly abducted by the US side at the US side's Bupyeong POW camp on June 18th by force and even the use of gas bombs, were forcibly incorporated into the US 3519 unit and the Gwangju Infantry School, respectively. Seo Eui-hyeop and others, prisoners of war of the Korean People's Army who were originally in the US Gwangju POW camp, were forcibly incorporated into the "Mount Jiri Suppression Team". Wang Yongxiang and others, prisoners of war of the Chinese People's Volunteers who were originally in a POW camp near Yeongdeungpo, were forcibly incorporated into the US military intelligence organization located on Seon Gap Island.

    Since the Korean-Chinese side possessed concrete evidence, including witnesses, the US side could not say a word to defend itself after General Li Xiangchao's stern denunciation.

    李相朝中将在军事停战委员会上
    斥责美方劫夺战俘充当炮灰
    【新华社开城十八日电】朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中代表团十八日发表公报如下：
    在十二月十八日的军事停战委员会上，朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将严词斥责美方强迫扣留战俘，并将他们强制编入美方部队或美方特务机关的罪恶行为。
    李相朝中将指出：在双方关于战俘问题的协议签字十天后，为美方背信弃义地强迫劫走的二万七千余名朝中被俘人员业已为美方编入其部队，而美方所以迄今尚未能对约三个月前朝中方面所提出的九万八千七百四十二名朝中被俘人员的名单作出任何负责的交代，也就是因为这些战俘的绝大部分业已为美方所强迫扣留，并强制编入美方的部队或特务机关。例如：六月十八日在美方富平战俘收容所为美方用武力乃至放瓦斯弹所劫走的朝鲜人民军被俘人员朴斗勋与金钟植等，即被分别强迫编入美方三五一九部队与光州步兵学校。原在美方光州战俘营的朝鲜人民军被俘人员徐义爕等即被强制编入“智异山讨伐队”。原在永登浦附近战俘营的中国人民志愿军被俘人员王永祥等即被强迫编入设在仙甲岛上的美军特务组织。
    由于朝中方面掌握有具体的证据，包括人证在内，美方在李相朝中将严词斥责后，说不出一句话来为自己辩护。
