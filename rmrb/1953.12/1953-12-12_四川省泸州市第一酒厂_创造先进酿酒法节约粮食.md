    Luzhou First Distillery in Sichuan Province
    Creates Advanced Brewing Method, Saving Grain
    The Li Youcheng group of the Luzhou Local State-Operated First Distillery in Sichuan Province has created an advanced brewing method. To brew 100 *jin* of 60-proof *baijiu*, only 189 *jin* of sorghum rice are needed. In comparison, other distilleries in the Southwest region generally require 230 *jin*, and some even require over 300 *jin*. If this method is promoted throughout Sichuan alone, based on the current output of *baijiu*, it can save more than 75.5 million *jin* of grain per year.
    The characteristic of this method is that it more scientifically regulates temperature and humidity during the production process and properly controls the brewing time, allowing the raw starch to be thoroughly cooked, saccharified completely, and fermented thoroughly. In this way, the starch contained in the sorghum is rarely wasted, and each *jin* of sorghum can be used to brew more *baijiu* than before.
    Currently, this advanced operating method has been summarized by the Ministry of Light Industry of the Central People's Government and has begun to be promoted throughout the country. (Xinhua News Agency)

    四川省泸州市第一酒厂
    创造先进酿酒法节约粮食
    四川省泸州市地方国营第一酒厂李友澄小组创造了一种先进的酿酒方法，酿制一百斤六十度的白酒，只要用高粱米一百八十九斤；而西南区其他酒厂一般都要用二百三十斤，有的厂还高达三百多斤。这个作业法单是在四川各地推广，按照目前酒的产量计算，一年就可以节约粮食七千五百五十多万斤。
    这个操作法的特点，就是在生产过程中比较科学地调节温度、湿度，掌握好酿制的时间，使得生淀粉能够熟透，糖化完全，发酵彻底，这样，高粱中所含的淀粉质就很少浪费掉，每斤高粱就可以酿出比过去更多的白酒。
    现在，这个先进操作法已由中央人民政府轻工业部总结出来，开始在全国各地推广。（新华社）
