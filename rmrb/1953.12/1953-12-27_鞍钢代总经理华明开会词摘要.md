    Anshan Iron and Steel Company Acting General Manager Hua Ming delivered a speech at the opening ceremony of the Large Rolling Mill, Seamless Steel Tube Plant, and No. 7 Blast Furnace. In his speech, he said:

    "The construction of Anshan Iron and Steel has been carried out under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the Party, and the government. Chairman Mao is deeply concerned about our construction. The Party and the government have transferred a large number of cadres and technicians from all over the country, organized the supply of materials and financial resources, and given us timely and wise instructions, constantly correcting the shortcomings in our work, making it possible and empowering us to complete such a major task. As we celebrate the opening of the Large Rolling Mill, Seamless Steel Tube Plant, and No. 7 Blast Furnace, all our employees express our infinite gratitude to Chairman Mao, the Party, and the government. The glory of completing the construction task should be attributed to the great Chairman Mao.

    "The rapid completion of the construction task of Anshan Iron and Steel is inseparable from the friendly assistance of our great ally, the Soviet Union. The Soviet government and the Soviet people have given us systematic technical and economic assistance, helped us with design using the latest technological achievements, supplied us with world-class technical equipment, helped us train a large number of interns, and sent a large number of excellent experts to help us with design, construction, installation, and commissioning. Soviet experts worked day and night to help us improve enterprise management and solve complex technical problems. They sincerely taught us the advanced Soviet science and technology and enterprise management knowledge at all times. Thanks to the help of the Soviet government and experts, we were able to complete the above-mentioned major projects in just eighteen months. The new achievements of Anshan Iron and Steel are one of the glorious crystallizations of Sino-Soviet friendship. We deeply thank the Soviet government and the Soviet people, and deeply thank the dear Soviet experts.

    "The spiritual encouragement and material assistance given to us by the people of the whole country and brother factories in various places have greatly helped our construction. More than fifty cities and more than one hundred and ninety factories across the country have manufactured equipment and materials for us. This is an indispensable condition for us to complete our task. We deeply thank the people of the whole country for their concern and the brotherly assistance given to us by brother factories.

    "All employees of Anshan Iron and Steel, following Chairman Mao's instructions on the general line of the transition period, learning from the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union, have worked diligently, earnestly, humbly, and cautiously in the cause of national industrialization and have done their due work. Now, a basic construction team has initially grown up, surveying and design forces have begun to take shape, and some model figures and advanced workers have emerged among workers, technicians, and cadres, giving play to their initiative and creativity under the leadership of the Party and the government, and completed this year's tasks. However, our technical level is still very poor, our enterprise management level is still very low, and there have been many shortcomings and errors in our past work. We should firmly and humbly continue to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, improve our technical level, improve our management level, further improve the ideological consciousness of all employees, overcome shortcomings and errors, and strive to meet the new and greater construction tasks."

    鞍钢代总经理华明开会词摘要
    鞍山钢铁公司华明代总经理在大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂、第七号炼铁炉开工典礼上致开会词。在致词中，他说：
    “鞍钢的建设是在毛主席、党和政府的正确领导之下进行的。毛主席亲切关怀着我们的建设。党和政府从全国抽调大批干部和技术人员组织了物力和财力的供应，并及时给予我们英明的指示，不断纠正我们工作中的缺点，使我们有了可能有了力量来完成这样一个重大的任务。当我们庆祝大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂、第七号炼铁炉开工的时候，我们全体职工向毛主席、党和政府表示无限的感激。完成建设任务的光荣，应归于伟大的毛主席。
    “鞍钢建设任务的迅速完成，是和伟大盟邦苏联的友谊援助分不开的。苏联政府和苏联人民给了我们系统的技术经济的援助，以最新的技术成就帮助我们进行了设计，供应了我们以世界上头等的技术装备，帮助我们培养了大批实习生，并派来了大批优秀的专家，帮助我们设计、建筑、安装和开工生产。苏联专家不分昼夜地工作，帮助我们改善了企业的管理，解决了复杂的技术问题。他们每时每刻都诚恳地将苏联的先进科学技术和企业管理知识教给我们。由于苏联政府和专家的帮助，我们才有可能在仅仅十八个月的时间内完成了上述的重大工程。鞍钢新的成就，是中苏友谊的光辉结晶之一。我们深深地感激苏联政府和苏联人民，深深地感激亲爱的苏联专家。
  “全国人民和各地兄弟工厂给予我们精神上的鼓励和物质上的援助，大大帮助了我们的建设。全国有五十几个城市、一百九十几个工厂为我们制造了设备和材料。这是我们完成任务所不可缺少的条件。我们深深地感谢全国人民对我们的关怀和兄弟工厂所给我们兄弟般的援助。
    “鞍钢全体职工遵循着毛主席关于过渡时期总路线的指示，学习着苏联的先进科学技术，兢兢业业地虚心谨慎地在为国家工业化的事业中作了自己应作的工作。现在，一支基本建设队伍已初步成长起来，勘测设计力量开始在形成，而且在工人、技术人员和干部中出现了一些模范人物和先进工作者，在党和政府领导下发挥了积极性和创造性，完成了今年的任务。但是，我们的技术水平还很差，企业管理水平还很低，在过去的工作中曾有过不少缺点和错误。我们应该坚定谦虚地继续学习苏联先进经验，提高技术水平，提高管理水平，进一步提高全体职工的思想觉悟，克服缺点和错误，为迎接新的更大的建设任务而奋斗。”（新华社）
