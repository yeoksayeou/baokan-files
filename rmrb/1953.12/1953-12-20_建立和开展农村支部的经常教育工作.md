Establishing and Developing Regular Education Work for Rural Branches

On the basis of the widespread publicity about the general line currently being carried out in our vast rural areas, establishing and developing regular education work for party branches is not only extremely necessary but also entirely possible.

To achieve the socialist transformation of agriculture, our rural party members must first of all be supporters of socialism and be good at leading the peasant masses to gradually implement this socialist transformation together. This requires us to unite millions of non-Party activists who can connect the Party with the working peasants. Stalin once said: "These activists surround our Party with an atmosphere of trust, linking the Party with the rest of the non-Party masses. Therefore, non-Party activists are not only a bridge of connection but also the richest reservoir from which our Party draws new strength. Without such activists, the development of our Party is impossible. If the broad mass of non-Party activists surrounding the Party are developing and consolidating, then the Party will also develop and consolidate. If these activists are gone, then the Party will decline and wither away." ("On the Party's Current Tasks in the Countryside") Therefore, educating the vast number of rural party members and non-Party activists about socialism and the Communist Party is one of the Party's most important tasks.

In the past few years, our Party's political education work for rural party members and non-Party activists has focused on utilizing the slack farming seasons and adopting a concentrated training approach, which has achieved great results. There is no doubt that this approach will still need to be adopted in the future. However, simply adopting this approach is completely insufficient. This is because: on the one hand, with the increasing development of the socialist transformation of agriculture and national construction, the socialist components in the countryside are required to continuously increase; to adapt to this requirement, the socialist consciousness of our rural party members and non-Party activists must be continuously improved, otherwise rural party members cannot become true Communist Party members, rural branches cannot become fortresses of the working class and socialism in the countryside, and the socialist transformation of agriculture and other work cannot be carried out. On the other hand, many rural party members and non-Party activists themselves are individual peasants, managing privately owned small plots of land and living the lives of ordinary peasants, so they are of course easily influenced by the capitalist tendencies in the countryside; another large group of party members and non-Party activists, although they have participated in cooperatives or mutual aid teams and live a life of collective labor, still cannot completely get rid of their original peasant characteristics because these cooperatives or mutual aid teams are still built on a private basis; at the same time, because there are still many individual peasants and even capitalist elements around them, the ideological dust of small producers and capitalism will pounce on them at all times, which will inevitably invade their bodies. Therefore, strengthening the Party's regular education work in rural branches, continuously improving the socialist consciousness of rural party members and non-Party activists and strengthening the Party spirit of Communist Party members, continuously overcoming their peasant consciousness and capitalist ideas, and enhancing their resistance to various erroneous and even reactionary ideas, is obviously extremely necessary. The North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee's "Instructions on Strengthening Regular Education Work in Rural Branches," "Plan for Regular Education Work in Rural Branches from November 1953 to October 1954" (these two documents are on the first page of this newspaper on December 4th), and the experience of regular education work in rural branches in Xingtang County, Hebei Province, published on the third page of this newspaper today, fully illustrate this point.

Is it possible to establish and develop regular education work for party branches? The example of Xingtang County, Hebei Province, tells us definitively that it is entirely possible. Not only is it possible, but it has already become a reality. However, the establishment and development of this work, like all other work, will not be smooth sailing and will encounter varying degrees of difficulties. Some comrades believe that there is a lot of work and a busy schedule in rural areas, so there is no time to carry out regular education work in party branches. It is true that there is a lot of work and a busy schedule in rural areas, but the amount of work and the busy schedule cannot be a reason to neglect the education work of party branches. If work in the countryside is not first relied on the Party, and education is not carried out among the party members of the branch to connect the thoughts of party members and non-Party activists, then the work will be even more chaotic and without a way out. Therefore, although carrying out regular education work in party branches adds one more task, it actually reduces more chaos. Therefore, it is obviously wrong to use the excuse of a lot of work and a busy schedule to evade the education work of party branches. In addition, some comrades believe that to establish rural branch education work, it is necessary to rely on district-level party member cadres to give lectures, but these cadres have a very low level of political theory, and the quality of education cannot be guaranteed, so it is better not to establish it. Obviously, this view is also one-sided. At present, the regular education work of rural branches mainly relies on district-level party member cadres to give lectures (it also relies on county-level party member cadres who can go to the countryside to give lectures). It is also a fact that the level of political theory of these cadres is generally not high, so it is not easy to improve the quality of education at once. However, in any case, the level of political theory of these district-level party member cadres is always higher than that of party members and non-Party activists in rural branches, so as long as party organizations at all levels give them appropriate assistance (such as strengthening their own learning, providing them with popular reading materials, strengthening the leadership of the preparation work, etc.), they are still able to give lectures. These cadres undertake the task of giving lectures to party members, which is also a powerful impetus for their own learning. After a certain process, their lecturing quality can be improved completely, and it will inevitably improve. As for some places treating the regular education work of branches as "five excesses" and opposing it, that is extremely wrong, and we have already criticized this point.

The experience of Xingtang proves that the conditions for establishing and developing regular education work in rural branches are fully available, that is: first, the vast number of rural party members and non-Party activists have the need for political study. They love the Communist Party and their country, so they are willing to understand the Party's policies and national affairs. They generally have a strong desire for progress, sincerely like to listen to the Party's words, and move forward along the road indicated by the Party. Once their learning requirements are stimulated, they will show a high degree of enthusiasm, which has been confirmed in the experience of Xingtang. Second, our party member cadres engaged in rural work are able to undertake lecturing work. When they start to establish this work, they may have many doubts, but as long as the reasons are explained to them, and they deeply understand the necessity and political significance of this work, they will be happy to take on this glorious responsibility and do this work well. With these two basic conditions, all other difficult problems will have the possibility of being solved.

Of course, to establish and develop regular education work in rural branches, party organizations at all levels still need to make a great determination and make resolute efforts. According to the experience of Xingtang, the work that needs to be done mainly includes the following:

First, explain to the vast number of party member cadres the necessity of this work and its favorable conditions, overcome the erroneous tendency of neglecting political and ideological education work, and take necessary measures to stimulate the enthusiasm of rural party members and non-Party activists for political study.

Second, in addition to the central bureaus, provincial committees, and prefectural committees providing popular and regular teaching materials and temporary teaching materials for rural branch education in a timely manner, county and district-level party organizations should pay attention to correctly arranging teaching content and strive to implement teaching methods that combine theory and practice.

Third, equip sufficient branch teachers and give them regular guidance and assistance.

Fourth, adapt to the dispersed characteristics of the countryside and the seasonality of agricultural production, and appropriately arrange various education systems and organizational forms. Here, the "passing on" system is indispensable and must be promoted; in addition, the number and time of classes should be appropriately stipulated.

Fifth, party organizations at all levels must conduct regular inspections and supervision, and pay attention to summarizing and promoting typical experiences.

There is no doubt that as long as the above-mentioned tasks are done well, the regular education work of rural branches can definitely be established and developed.

The next few months of this winter and spring are a good time to establish and develop regular education work in rural branches. All places that have already established branches or are about to establish branches should establish and develop regular education work in branches in coordination with the work of grain requisitioning, grain purchasing, and the development of agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation. Places that have already established regular education work in branches should rectify them as much as possible during this period, and through this education, further deeply publicize the general line to party members and non-Party activists. When summarizing the publicity work in this winter and spring at the end of next spring, we should make new arrangements so that the future work will be further improved on the existing foundation. Places that have not yet established regular branch education work should also adopt the method of county and district cadres giving lectures to party members and non-Party activists during this period to conduct general line education, so as to fix this education method when summarizing the work next spring, making it systematic and regular. As for places with very few party members or no party members, after next spring, they can also adopt appropriate methods to conduct regular education for the existing few party members or non-Party activists, so that they can continuously improve politically, lay the foundation for establishing and developing party organizations, and enable them to play a greater role in future work.

Establishing and developing regular education work in rural branches on a national scale can no longer be postponed. Party organizations at all levels and party member cadres engaged in rural work must step up their efforts to do this work well. This is also a manifestation of being enthusiastic about the socialist cause and a manifestation of supporting the general line. It is certain that this work, like other work, can be done very well with the efforts of all party comrades.

### 建立和开展农村支部的经常教育工作

    建立和开展农村支部的经常教育工作
    在目前我国广大农村中普遍开展了关于总路线的宣传的基础上，建立和开展支部的经常教育工作，不仅是极端需要的，而且是完全可能的。
    为要实现对于农业的社会主义改造，我们的农村党员就首先必须是拥护社会主义的，并且要善于带动农民群众一齐来逐步实行这个社会主义改造。这就需要我们去团结千百万的、能把党同劳动农民联系起来的农民非党积极分子。斯大林曾经说过：“这些积极分子以信任的气氛围绕着我们党，把党和其余非党群众联系起来。所以，非党积极分子不仅是一座联系的桥梁，而且是一个我们党向之汲取新力量的最丰富的仓库。没有这种积极分子，我们党的发展是不可能的。如果环绕着党的广大非党积极分子在发展和巩固，那末党也会发展和巩固。如果这种积极分子没有了，那末党就会衰败和枯萎下去。”（“论党在农村中的当前任务”）因此，向广大的农村党员和非党积极分子进行关于社会主义和共产党的教育，就是党的极其重要的任务之一。
    过去几年来，我们的党对农村党员及非党积极分子的政治教育工作，曾着重地利用农闲季节，采取突击的训练方式进行，并取得了很大的成效，毫无疑义，这种方式在今后也还需要继续采用。但是，仅仅采用这种方式是完全不够的。这是因为：一方面，随着对农业的社会主义改造和国家建设的日益发展，要求农村的社会主义成份不断地增长；为了适应这种要求，我们的农村党员及非党积极分子对于社会主义的觉悟，就必须不断地提高再提高，否则农村党员就不能成为真正的共产党员，农村支部也就不能成为工人阶级和社会主义在农村的堡垒，农村社会主义改造工作及其他工作就不能进行。另方面，我们的许多农村党员及非党积极分子本身就是个体农民，经营着私有的小块土地，过着普通农民的生活，当然就很容易接受农村的资本主义倾向的影响；另外一大批党员及非党积极分子虽然参加了合作社或互助组，过着集体劳动的生活，但是由于这些合作社或互助组仍然是建筑在私有基础上的，所以还不能完全摆脱原有的农民的特点；同时由于他们的周围还有许多个体农民乃至资本主义分子存在，因而小生产者和资本主义的思想灰尘，每时每刻都会向他们扑来，这也就难免要侵入他们的肌体里来。因此加强党在农村支部的经常教育工作，不断地提高农村党员及非党积极分子对于社会主义的觉悟并加强共产党员的党性，不断地克服他们的农民意识和资本主义思想，增强他们对各种错误乃至反动思想的抵抗力，显然就是极端需要的了。中共中央华北局“关于加强农村支部经常教育工作的指示”、“一九五三年十一月到一九五四年十月关于农村支部经常教育工作的计划”（这两个文件见本报十二月四日第一版）和今天本报第三版登载的河北省行唐县农村支部的经常教育工作的经验充分说明了这个道理。
    建立和开展支部的经常教育工作是否可能呢？河北省行唐县的例子确凿地告诉我们：这是完全可能的。不仅可能，而且已经成为现实了。但是，这一工作的建立和开展，与其他所有的工作一样，都不会是一帆风顺的，都会遇到不同程度的困难的。有些同志认为：农村工作多、工作忙，因此没有功夫来开展支部的经常教育工作。不错，农村工作确是很多而且很忙，但是，工作的多而且忙，并不能成为忽视支部教育工作的理由。如果在农村中进行工作不首先依靠党，向支部党员进行教育，打通党员和非党积极分子的思想，那末工作更要陷于忙乱和没有出路。所以，开展支部的经常教育工作，虽然加多了一项工作，实际上却正是减少了更多的忙乱。因此用工作多和忙为借口来搪塞支部教育工作显然是错误的。另外，有些同志认为：要建立农村支部教育工作，就要靠区级党员干部授课，而这些干部政治理论水平很低，教育质量也就无法保证，因此不如不建立。显然，这种看法也是片面的。农村支部的经常教育工作，在目前当然主要是依靠区级党员干部上课（也要依靠能够下乡的县级党员干部上课），这些干部一般地说政治理论水平不高也是事实，所以，教育质量要一下提得很高，也是不容易的。但是，无论如何，这些区级党员干部的政治理论水平，总是比农村支部的党员和非党积极分子要高一些，因此，只要各级党的组织对他们给以适当的帮助（如加强他们本身的学习、供给他们通俗的读物、加强对备课工作的领导等等），他们仍然是能够上课的。这些干部担负了为党员上课的任务，对他们本身的学习，也是一个有力的督促。经过一定的过程，他们的授课质量完全可以提高，而且必然会提高。至于，有些地方把支部的经常教育工作也当作“五多”来加以反对，那更是极端错误的，这一点，我们已经加以批判了。
    行唐的经验证明：建立和开展农村支部的经常教育工作的条件是完全具备的，这就是：第一，广大的农村党员及非党积极分子有政治学习的要求，他们热爱共产党、热爱自己的国家，所以他们是愿意了解党的政策和国家大事的，他们一般都有强烈的进步的愿望，衷心地欢喜听党的话，并沿着党所指示的道路前进。他们的学习要求一经启发，就会表现出很高的积极性，这在行唐的经验中业已得到证实。第二，我们从事农村工作的党员干部，是能够担任授课工作的，在开始建立这一工作的时候，他们也许会有许多疑虑，但是，只要向他们说明道理，使他们深切地懂得这一工作的必要性和政治意义，他们就会乐于担负这个光荣责任，并把这个工作做好。有了这两条基本的条件，其他一切困难问题也就有了解决的可能了。
    当然，要建立和开展农村支部的经常教育工作，还需要各级党的组织下很大的决心，并作坚决的努力。依据行唐的经验，需要做的工作主要有如下各项：
    第一，向广大党员干部说明这一工作的必要性和它的有利条件，克服忽视政治思想教育工作的错误倾向，并采取必要的办法启发农村党员及非党积极分子对于政治学习的积极性。
    第二，除由中央局、省委和地委及时地供给农村支部教育的通俗的经常教材和临时教材以外，县、区级党的组织要注意正确地安排教学内容，并努力贯彻理论和实际联系的教学方法。
    第三，配备足够的支部教员，并给以经常的指导和帮助。
    第四，适应农村的分散的特点和农业生产的季节性，恰当地安排各种教育制度和组织形式。在这里，传授制度是不可少的，必须加以推广；此外还要适当地规定上课的次数和时间。
    第五，各级党的组织必须进行经常的检查和督促，并注意总结和推广典型经验。
    毫无疑义，只要做好上述的各项工作，农村支部的经常教育工作就一定可以建立和开展起来。
    今冬明春的几个月时间，正是建立和开展农村支部的经常教育工作的良好时机。凡是已经建立支部或即将建立支部的地方，都应当配合着征粮、购粮的工作和发展农业生产互助合作的工作，建立和开展支部的经常教育工作。已经建立支部的经常教育工作的地方，要尽可能地在这期间加以整顿，并通过这种教育向党员及非党积极分子进一步深入地宣传总路线。在明年春末总结今冬明春的宣传工作的时候，更应做出新的布置，使今后的工作在已有的基础之上更加提高一步。还没有建立经常的支部教育工作的地方，也要在这期间采取县、区干部向党员及非党积极分子上课的方式，进行总路线的教育，以便在明春总结工作的时候把这种教育方式固定下来，使之系统化、经常化。至于党员很少或没有党员的地方，在明年春天以后也可以采取适当的方式，对已有的少数党员或非党积极分子进行经常的教育，使他们在政治上能够不断地提高，为建立和发展党的组织打下基础，并使他们在今后的工作中发挥更大的作用。
    在全国范围内建立和开展农村支部的经常教育工作，是再也不能推延了。各级党的组织和从事农村工作的党员干部，必须加紧努力，做好这一工作。这也正是热心于社会主义事业的一种表现，正是拥护总路线的一种表现。可以确信，这一工作和其他工作一样，在全党同志的努力下，一定可以做得很好。
