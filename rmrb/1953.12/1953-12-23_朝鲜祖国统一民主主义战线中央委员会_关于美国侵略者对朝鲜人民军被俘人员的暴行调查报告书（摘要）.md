The Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland of Korea
Report on the Investigation of Atrocities Committed by American Aggressors Against Captured Personnel of the Korean People's Army (Abstract)

On December 10, the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland of Korea published a "Report on the Investigation of Atrocities Committed by American Aggressors Against Captured Personnel of the Korean People's Army," which is divided into nine chapters and contains approximately 30,000 words. The abstract is as follows:

Chapter One: Introduction

The introduction of the report states: The American aggressors, who launched the war of aggression in Korea, violently trampled on various principles, regulations, and war regulations of international law, and systematically carried out unprecedented bestial atrocities, while also subjecting prisoners of war to bestial abuse and various atrocities.

The Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland of Korea has reviewed many accusations from captured personnel of the Korean People's Army who have returned to the homeland regarding direct persecution, abuse, and unbearable suffering in the American prisoner-of-war camps, and has conducted careful investigations, listening to their firsthand experiences and detailed accounts of inhumane treatment and atrocities they witnessed. Based on their testimonies and the facts of the scars left on their bodies, the committee has prepared this report to expose some of the atrocities of the American aggressors and the Syngman Rhee gang.

According to a large number of conclusive materials and irrefutable evidence obtained from the investigation, the common nature and characteristics of the many heinous atrocities committed by the American aggressors against captured personnel of the Korean People's Army are: the incidents of the U.S. military violating the Geneva Convention and other recognized international regulations by committing atrocities against prisoners of war began on the first day of capturing the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army and were being manufactured anytime and anywhere. These atrocities were not accidental or isolated, but were carried out on the broadest basis, and there was not a single American prisoner-of-war camp that had not experienced bloody incidents of large-scale massacres of captured personnel of the Korean People's Army, and these atrocities were unprecedentedly brutal. The American aggressors and the Syngman Rhee gang not only threatened, intimidated, and suppressed prisoners of war, trampled on the human rights of prisoners of war, and subjected them to the most tyrannical and humiliating torture, but also shot, stabbed, crushed with tanks, scalded with boiling water, had them bitten to death by wolves and dogs, drowned, beat to death, starved to death, froze to death, and even dismembered the bodies of the murdered prisoners of war, forcing other prisoners of war and nearby residents to watch. The American aggressors used extremely brutal methods of torture such as electric shock, pouring chili water, and beatings during interrogations of prisoners of war, and committed bestial atrocities, insults, and forced acts against women.

The American aggressors committed various atrocities against prisoners of war not only to deprive and trample on the rights and freedoms of prisoners of war, but also to achieve certain military and political goals, that is, to forcibly detain the captured personnel of the People's Army and transfer them to the Syngman Rhee gang to serve as cannon fodder.

The American aggressors spread false propaganda and carried out atrocities such as forced "screening" and tattooing. According to the characteristics of their atrocities, they can be divided into the following stages:

From September 1950 to February 1951, it was the initial stage in which the American aggressors carried out various atrocities against the captured personnel of the People's Army, and they also prepared to deprive the prisoners of war of their right to return to their country. They carried out terror, massacres, and forced labor against prisoners of war, deprived prisoners of war of the minimum living conditions, deliberately neglected the treatment of many wounded prisoners of war, used prisoners of war as shooting targets, and used cruel methods to force prisoners of war to provide military secrets and secret information about the politics and economy of North Korea. They also attempted to conduct espionage education on prisoners of war, and forcibly dispatched prisoners of war who had received such education to the rear of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. They allowed a large number of secret agents and thugs to infiltrate the prisoner-of-war camps, illegally set up detention rooms, police, guard teams, and strict intelligence networks, and used prisoners of war as experimental subjects for bacteriological weapons, forcing prisoners of war to accept reactionary education and reactionary propaganda, and forcing them to admit that they were "war criminals."

The period from the beginning of February 1951 to June 1952, when large numbers of captured personnel of the People's Army were sent to Geoje Island, was the second stage. During this stage, bloody massacres of prisoners of war were frequently and on a large scale. The American aggressors, in order to have prisoners of war "refuse repatriation" and carry out conspiracies of incitement and persecution, set up so-called "schools" in the prisoner-of-war camps, used so-called churches and their staff, and established a police terror system and various reactionary terror groups by secret agents and thugs, forcing prisoners of war to sign and seal various documents forcibly detaining them, write blood oaths, accept tattoos, force prisoners of war to shout reactionary slogans, and hold so-called marches and demonstrations in support of "voluntary repatriation," and carry out "individual interviews" with prisoners of war, massacring resisters in various brutal ways. The U.S. and Rhee troops indiscriminately fired machine guns, carbines, and flamethrowers at the prisoner-of-war camps to protect the secret agents and thugs. They crushed prisoners of war to death with tanks, and forced prisoners of war to move around South Korea in order to forcibly detain 80,000 of our captured personnel. As a result, large-scale massacres of prisoners of war occurred frequently.

The period from June 1952 to the repatriation of prisoners of war was the third stage. The American aggressors exhausted all their efforts to forcibly detain prisoners of war, depriving prisoners of war of all freedom, and unscrupulously strengthened the terror and atrocities against prisoners of war. As a result, large-scale massacres of prisoners of war also occurred frequently in American prisoner-of-war camps such as Bee Rock Island and Yongcho Island. These atrocities were carried out with the participation of a large number of organized troops.

Due to the atrocities of the American aggressors, according to the materials revealed by the returned personnel of the Korean People's Army alone, more than 33,600 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army were killed, and tens of thousands were injured and disabled.

The report then lists some representative examples of the atrocities committed by the American aggressors against captured personnel of the People's Army in categories.

Chapter Two: On the Massacre of Prisoners of War

The report points out: On September 15, 1950, U.S. Army Armored Forces Captain Harrison, who landed in Incheon, ordered 45 soldiers to concentrate fire on more than 150 prisoners of war with light and heavy machine guns and rifles at the Incheon pier, shooting them all to death and throwing them into the sea. On October 25, 1950, U.S. Eighth Army Military Police Captain William led U.S. military police to the Pyongyang Sijang market, where prisoners of war were imprisoned, pulled 29 prisoners of war in front of the crowd and shot them to death, and William himself also participated in the shooting with a pistol. On November 15, 1950, prisoners of war in temporary concentration camps in Pyongyang Textile Factory and other places were stripped of their clothes and belongings. When they gathered to keep warm, U.S. military police captains and Syngman Rhee's puppet army indiscriminately fired at them, killing 149 people. On October 28, 1950, a fire broke out in the American prisoner-of-war camp temporarily set up in the Pyongyang Correctional Institution. The U.S. military indiscriminately fired at prisoners of war who escaped from the fire, resulting in the death of more than 100 prisoners of war and serious injuries to more than 20. In addition, the U.S. military also shot dead 40 prisoners of war who had already escaped from the fire. From October 24 to December 10, 1950, prisoners of war in temporary shelters such as the Incheon Juvenile Prison were escorted to several transport ships and sent to Busan. The loading exceeded the capacity several times. Most of the boarding took place in the middle of the night, and the U.S. and Rhee forces forced prisoners of war to run onto the ships, resulting in 500 people falling into the sea and drowning. More than 150 people died of suffocation at the bottom of the ships. During the voyage, about 100 prisoners of war on each ship died of thirst, hunger, or disease, and were thrown into the sea. On November 8, 1950, a U.S. military police sergeant second class stationed in the Fourth Regiment of Dongnae instructed U.S. soldiers to beat nine prisoners of war, including Namgung Il, who were exhausted from being forced to work, and crushed them to death with ten-wheeled trucks in public. On November 15, 1950, a U.S. military second sergeant guarding the Dongnae prisoner-of-war camp ordered 17 prisoners of war, including Lee Hyung-gu, to sit down while forcing them to carry out the labor of expanding the Busan military airport, and then blew 15 of them up with explosives, and seriously injured ten prisoners of war nearby. On the evening of December 24, 1950, the U.S. military forced prisoners of war to transport food at Busan's Third Pier, beat nine prisoners of war, including Kim Nak-soo, and shot them or threw them into the sea. On January 30, 1951, a fire broke out in the U.S. military food warehouse at Busan's Third Pier. U.S. 94th Military Police Battalion Commander Lieutenant Colonel Hainki led more than 100 U.S. troops to the scene and forced prisoners of war who were working to put out the fire, shooting seven prisoners of war on the spot and injuring twelve. On the evening of March 15, 1951, the U.S. military crushed Lee Ki-hyun, a seriously ill prisoner of war, to death with a stone roller in the 61st prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island.

Chapter Three: On the Difficult Living Conditions of Prisoners of War

The report points out: The American aggressors violated the requirements of international law and treated prisoners of war with inhumane means in terms of basic conditions for hygiene and health, and the supply of dormitories, drinking water, and clothing. They even used terror to respond to the prisoners of war's legitimate demands, even on minor issues. For example, from November 6 to December 27, 1950, the American aggressors used the Pyongyang Textile Factory as a temporary concentration camp, accommodating approximately 3,000 prisoners of war. In this severely damaged building, there were no facilities for protection against the cold and rain, or for hygiene. The food supplied was extremely poor, water could not be drunk on time, and it was impossible to wash one's face and hands. As a result, infectious diseases broke out among the prisoners of war, and many people died. In more than ten days from November 10 to 23, fifteen prisoners of war, including Yang Ren-pei, died of illness. From December 1950 to March 1951, the U.S. military authorities erected tents in the rice paddies near Busan Airport, accommodating more than 30,000 prisoners of war, forcing them to do hard labor and suffering from the cold, wind, and rain. As a result, those who fell ill accounted for four-fifths of the total number, and the vast majority of those who fell ill did not receive medical assistance. As a result, in one prisoner-of-war camp under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Fourth Battalion alone, among the 6,000 prisoners of war, there were more than 1,400 who were seriously ill, and an average of seven or eight people died every day. On January 1, 1951, the U.S. military forced prisoners of war to unload grain at Busan's Third Pier and threw twenty of them into the sea to drown. From the beginning of 1951 to the end of March, the U.S. military forced more than 8,000 prisoners of war to build the Suwon Airport. Due to abuse, in February alone, more than 30 prisoners of war died at the scene, 380 became seriously ill, 17 were injured, and 150 were hospitalized, of whom 29 died. The U.S. military forced prisoners of war in the Seomyeon Fifth Prisoner-of-War Camp in Busan to work unloading ships, injuring 70 prisoners of war on December 23, 1950, and throwing five into the sea to drown.

Chapter Four: On the Trampling and Deprivation of the Human Rights and Freedoms of Prisoners of War

The report cites examples: Because the U.S. military authorities forced all prisoner-of-war camps on Geoje Island to post anti-communist slogans, hang "South Korea," the United States, and the United Nations flags, and organize reactionary organizations, and instructed secret agents to kill prisoners of war who did not believe in religion, prisoners of war in the 78th prisoner-of-war camp protested. As a result, more than a dozen prisoners of war were unreasonably detained. When prisoners of war demanded the release of the detainees, the U.S. side mobilized the U.S. and Rhee troops to surround the prisoner-of-war camp on September 17, 1951, killing 38 prisoners of war and injuring 194 with guns and grenades, while throwing 585 prisoners of war into prison. On Christmas 1951, the U.S. and Rhee troops again forced the prisoner-of-war camps on Geoje Island to hang U.S. flags and surrounded and attacked the 73rd prisoner-of-war camp. Seven prisoners of war were killed for expressing opposition, 47 were seriously injured, and 902 were imprisoned. On January 25, 1952, the director of the 6th receiving station of the 12th Field Hospital in Busan, under the instructions of the U.S. Far East Command, forced eight captured military doctors to broadcast in order to help them deny the U.S. military's crimes of conducting bacteriological warfare in Korea. The prisoners of war refused to do so and were all imprisoned and beaten. From September 27 to October 3, 1952, the U.S. military searched the 14th prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island, injuring more than 2,800 prisoners of war who opposed the search and detaining 235. A search was conducted in the 1st prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island on May 1, 1953, and eight prisoners of war were injured. On August 15, 1951, the U.S. military shot and killed three prisoners of war who were singing Korean liberation songs in the 62nd prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island, and injured 27. In the 1st to 11th prisoner-of-war camps on Geoje Island, 44 prisoners of war who were celebrating the festival were killed. On September 18, 1951, the U.S. military police fired at the prisoners of war for nearly an hour, killing 13 prisoners of war. On the "February 8th" anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army in 1953, the authorities of the 17th prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island suppressed the prisoners of war's celebration activities and killed four prisoners of war who were singing. On March 9, 1953, the prisoners of war in the 3rd prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island were beaten because they had worn mourning clothes when they heard the news of Stalin's death. On April 17, 1953, the 3rd prisoner-of-war camp on Yongcho Island issued an order to the prisoners of war: if they refused to take off their People's Army caps or refused to work, they would be severely punished. That afternoon, the U.S. military surrounded the prisoner-of-war camp and threw more than 150 grenades, massacring 17 prisoners of war.

Chapter Five: On the Forced Detention of Prisoners of War

The report points out: The American aggressors attempted to forcibly detain prisoners of war from the first day of their war of aggression against Korea. To this end, they conducted forced "screening" of prisoners of war, forced prisoners of war to write "petitions for release," and created the so-called "voluntary repatriation" proposal during the Korean armistice negotiations. Since the authorities of the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps began "screening" prisoners of war in March 1952, the U.S. and Rhee executioners and their secret agents have massacred countless prisoners of war who were willing to return to their homeland. In early December 1950, U.S. military and Syngman Rhee secret agents in hospitals in prisoner-of-war camps in Busan and Geoje Island, under the direct command of U.S. Army Brigadier General Nichols, forced sick and wounded prisoners of war to write "petitions for release" and massacred and beat prisoners of war who refused. In the First Hospital alone, eight prisoners of war, including Kim Mun-soo, were killed on December 7, and more than 50 were injured. On October 15, 1951, Syngman Rhee's secret agents in the 60th to 68th prisoner-of-war camps on Geoje Island forced prisoners of war to sign acknowledgments that they were detained civilians and massacred more than 80 prisoners of war who resisted and injured more than 500. On February 18, 1952, about 1,000 U.S. troops carrying heavy machine guns and other weapons surrounded the 62nd prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island. Because the prisoners of war refused to sign acknowledgments that they were civilians, they concentrated fire on them, killing 102 prisoners of war and injuring more than 260. On March 13, 1952, U.S. military officers commanded 300 U.S. troops, puppet troops, and about 1,000 Syngman Rhee secret agents who were ambushing in various prisoner-of-war camps to attack the 92nd prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island. Thirteen prisoners of war were killed and 78 were seriously injured. On June 10, 1952, prisoner-of-war camp commander U.S. Army Brigadier General Bonner mobilized about 4,000 U.S. troops to continuously attack more than 6,800 prisoners of war in the 76th prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island for four hours, resulting in 276 prisoners of war being killed and more than 4,000 injured. On April 7, 1952, the deputy adjutant and chaplain of the U.S. 94th Military Police Battalion handed seven pistols and tear gas to Kim Doo-ik, a secret agent lurking in the 76th prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island, instructing him not to allow a single prisoner of war to request repatriation. On April 8, the secret agents massacred more than 170 prisoners of war with pistols. On the same day, U.S. military officers and chaplains in the 81st prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island also instructed secret agents to massacre more than 90 prisoners of war who demanded to return to North Korea. On April 9, the authorities of the 83rd prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island forcibly "screened" more than 6,400 prisoners of war, massacring more than 50 prisoners of war and burying 60 alive. The authorities of the 73rd prisoner-of-war camp instructed secret agents to beat 27 prisoners of war to death with shovels, hoes, and other tools. On April 12, more than 125 prisoners of war were also massacred in the 71st prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island. On April 8, the U.S. 94th Military Police Battalion, in collaboration with the Rhee puppet military police guard team, massacred 72 prisoners of war who demanded to return to North Korea in the 93rd prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island. On April 10, 150 prisoners of war were massacred in the 91st prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island, and 34 prisoners of war were beaten to death with sticks in the 94th prisoner-of-war camp. On April 14, eight prisoners of war, including Zhao In-soo, were also beaten to death in the 1st prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island.

Chapter Six: On the Atrocities Against Female Prisoners of War

The report points out: The U.S. military not only failed to consider the physiological conditions and health care of female prisoners of war, but also subjected them to various abuses, tortures, and even forced them to parade naked in the streets with knives and guns, or raped them and then killed them. According to the accounts of only 70 returnees who provided materials, there were 128 female prisoners of war who were raped by the U.S. military, 34 who were killed for attempted rape, 44 who were killed by the U.S. military after rape to cover up their crimes, 120 who were killed for other reasons, and 130 who were injured. For example, on October 16, 1950, in Goksan County, Hwanghae Province, a U.S. military police captain commanded a military police lieutenant of the Rhee puppet 2nd Army Corps to torture and rape female prisoner of war Kim In-sook, and shot her to death on the morning of the 18th. On October 28, 1950, in the U.S. military field hospital in Suncheon, South Pyongan Province, the U.S. military stripped five female prisoners of war, including Zhao Young-hee, naked, poured gasoline on them, and burned them to death. In April 1952, U.S. military lower sergeant Dinny and others at the 64th Field Hospital of the U.S. military on Geoje Island insulted many female prisoners of war who were transferred from Busan. On October 14, 1950, 80 male and female prisoners of war were transferred from Uijeongbu to Seoul. Two female prisoners of war were shot and killed by the U.S. military on the way. When they arrived in Seoul, the U.S. military forced the prisoners of war to parade naked in the streets. On October 5, 1950, the U.S. military dragged female prisoner of war Kim Ae-ja into an empty carriage at the Waegwan Station, raped her, and shot her to death next to the station. On the evening of August 5, 1952, Morrison, the director of the receiving station of the 64th Field Hospital of the U.S. military on Geoje Island, attempted to rape sick female prisoner of war Kim Jung-sook and shot her to death with a pistol. On March 10, 1952, the U.S. military in the intelligence section of the 2nd receiving station of the 100th prisoner-of-war camp in Busan tortured Kang Jam-sook and Jung Jung-soon for six hours because they refused to serve as nurses. Kang Jam-sook was beaten to death on the spot.

Chapter Seven: On the Abuse and Medical Experimentation of Sick and Wounded Prisoners of War

The report points out: According to the accounts of only 376 returnees who provided materials, 2,018 People's Army prisoners of war were killed in this way, and 1,116 were disabled. For example, on September 25, 1950, prisoner of war Chao Yong-guo fractured his left leg joint and was captured on the 26th. On October 20, he was detained in the 1st prisoner-of-war camp in Busan and was used for medical experiments. After five amputations, the lower half of his left leg was completely lost. On October 13, 1950, Zhao Min-heon was captured north of Hongcheon, Gangwon Province, after being wounded in his left arm and left leg. The U.S. military not only did not give him treatment, but deliberately cut off the bones from his wounds to use as materials for bone grafting. On October 6, 1950, Kang Jung-sook was shot by U.S. military machine guns in the left toe and lower part of the left leg in Wonsan City. The U.S. military performed five amputations on her, leaving her disabled. U.S. Army Major Ruskin, the director of surgery at the U.S. 14th Field Hospital, also performed lung surgery on many patients among the prisoners of war as experimental subjects. When the prisoners of war were unwilling, he instigated secret agents to beat them. When the prisoners of war were beaten unconscious, he performed the surgery. All those who underwent surgery died. The head of the hospital's laboratory also conducted various drug experiments on patients. The number of prisoners of war who died without treatment was even greater. The authorities of the U.S. 14th Field Hospital, in order to spread infectious diseases, did not isolate dysentery patients at all. As a result, from October 1950 to May 1951, more than 20 people died of dysentery every day. On November 23, 1950, 91 people died. For the same reason, more than 2,000 prisoners of war died in the 4th prisoner-of-war camp in eight months. In this 4th prisoner-of-war camp located in Geoje-ri, Busan, from October 15, 1950, to the end of February 1951, more than 6,700 prisoners of war died due to the U.S. military deliberately refusing to provide treatment. From December 1950 to March 1951, 960 prisoners of war also died of illness without treatment in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th hospitals in Busan.

Chapter Eight: On Conducting Weapons Performance Experiments on Prisoners of War

The report points out: The U.S. military authorities also conducted weapons performance experiments on prisoners of war, including experiments on the performance of atomic weapons. On November 16, 1950, the 7th receiving station affiliated to the 100th prisoner-of-war camp in Geoje-ri, Busan, accommodated approximately 2,000 People's Army prisoners of war sent from Incheon, Danyang, and other places. At 10:00 a.m. on the 20th, the U.S. military forced more than 300 artillery prisoners of war to be transported by truck to the foot of a mountain six kilometers away, ordered them to sit or lie down, and then concentrated fire on them with pre-arranged tanks and heavy machine guns, killing them all in order to experiment with the lethality of the weapons and the accuracy of the shooting. On July 7, 1952, Bonner, the commander of the Geoje Island prisoner-of-war camp, led two military doctors to transport 120 prisoners of war received by the 4th Battalion to a location about three kilometers away from the 1st Pier of Geoje Island and conducted a poison gas experiment for about four hours, causing these prisoners of war to be unable to open their eyes for the next two months. On December 30, 1952, a U.S. aircraft dropped a paper tube over the dormitory of the 4th Battalion of the 17th prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island. The paper tube opened in the air. Then, all the personnel of the 4th Battalion suffered from eye diseases, and military doctors came every week to investigate the eye diseases. On August 13, 1952, the U.S. military drove more than 500 prisoners of war into a wire cage and used two squads of soldiers to throw more than 1,000 poison gas bombs into the cage for experimentation. As a result, more than 350 prisoners of war were seriously injured, 44 lost consciousness, four died, three lost their hearing, and six became completely blind. In mid-May 1951, the American aggressors loaded 1,500 prisoners of war onto a ship off the coast about one mile from the 2nd Pier of Geoje Island and set sail for other places to conduct experiments on the performance of atomic bombs. This was witnessed by 25 other prisoners of war who were forced to transport materials on the dock at the time, and they heard Yang Yin-pei, a Rhee puppet military sergeant who was monitoring them, say it. On the night of October 23, 1950, U.S. military officers and soldiers transported more than 800 prisoners of war from the Seomyeon receiving station affiliated to the Busan prisoner-of-war camp from the 3rd Pier of Busan on a U.S. military gray transport ship that could accommodate 5,000 people, and their whereabouts are unknown.

Chapter Nine: Conclusion

The report points out in the conclusion: The above facts are only a very small part of the facts determined after a fair and scientific investigation. However, from this, we can also see the whole truth of the barbaric and criminal acts committed by the American aggressor troops against the captured personnel of the People's Army, and prove that this organized and planned atrocity of the U.S. military was carried out according to the direct instructions of the American warlords and the heads of the ruling group. The American aggressors' acts of violently violating the provisions of the 1907 Hague Regulations on the treatment of prisoners of war and the Geneva Conventions of 1927 and 1949 on the treatment of prisoners of war and other international regulations have left the most shameful page in human history. The criminals who committed these bloody atrocities in Korea will absolutely not escape their guilt. The people of the world condemn these criminals with anger and excitement and demand the immediate punishment of the American aggressors who have subjected the heroic Korean people and the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army to inhuman atrocities.

    关于美国侵略者对朝鲜人民军被俘人员的暴行调查报告书（摘要）
    朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会在十二月十日发表“关于美国侵略者对朝鲜人民军被俘人员的暴行调查报告书”，全文共分九章，约三万字。摘要如下：
    第一章：序论
    报告书序论中指出：在朝鲜发动侵略战争的美国侵略者，狂暴地蹂躏国际法的各种原则、规定和战争法规，有组织地施行史无前例的野兽暴行，同时对战俘也横施野兽般的虐待和种种暴行。
    朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会审核了回到祖国的朝鲜人民军被俘人员关于在美方战俘营中直接遭受迫害、虐待和不可忍受的痛苦的许多控诉，并进行了慎重的调查，听取了他们亲身体验和亲眼看到的有关非人道待遇和暴行的详细陈述。委员会根据他们的证言和他们身上残留的伤痕等事实作成这个报告书，以揭发美国侵略者和李承晚匪帮的一部分暴行。
    根据调查得到的大量确凿的材料和不可辩驳的证据，美国侵略者对朝鲜人民军被俘人员施行的许多罪恶暴行的共同性质和特征是：美军违反日内瓦公约及其他公认的国际法规对战俘施行暴行的事件，从俘掳朝鲜人民军被俘人员的第一天起就开始制造并随时随地在制造着。这种暴行不是偶然和个别的，而是在最广泛的基础上进行的，没有一个美方战俘营不曾发生过大规模屠杀朝鲜人民军被俘人员的血腥事件，而且这种暴行带有空前的残酷性。美国侵略者和李承晚匪帮不但威胁、恫吓、压制战俘，蹂躏战俘的人权，对战俘加以最横暴的侮辱性的拷问，而且把战俘枪毙，刺杀，用坦克辗死，用开水烫死，用狼狗咬死，淹死，打死，饿死，冻死，甚至于分割被害战俘的尸体，强迫其他战俘和附近的居民观看。美国侵略者在审问战俘时使用了电刑、灌辣椒水、毒打等极残暴的拷问方法，对女性施行野兽般的暴行和侮辱、强迫行为。
    美国侵略者对战俘施行种种暴行不仅是为了剥夺和蹂躏战俘的权利和自由，而且是为了要实现其一定的军事、政治目的，即企图强迫扣留人民军被俘人员，把他们移交给李承晚匪帮充当炮灰。
    美国侵略者散布虚伪宣传，对战俘进行了强迫“甄别”和刺画、刺字等暴行。根据其暴行的特征可以分为下面几个阶段：
    一九五零年九月到一九五一年二月，是美国侵略者对人民军被俘人员施行种种暴行的最初阶段，他们并为剥夺战俘回国的权利而进行了准备工作。他们对战俘肆行恐怖、屠杀行为和强迫劳役，剥夺战俘最低限度的生活条件，对许多负伤战俘的治疗故意怠工，以战俘为射击靶子，以残酷手段迫使战俘提供军事机密和北朝鲜政治、经济的机密情报，并企图对战俘实施间谍教育，把受过这种教育的战俘强迫派遣到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国后方。他们使大批特务和打手混入战俘营，非法设置禁闭室、警察、警备队等，和严密的情报网，并以战俘为细菌武器的试验对象，强迫战俘接受反动教育和反动宣传，强迫他们承认是“战犯”。
    一九五一年二月初旬到一九五二年六月把人民军被俘人员大批押送到巨济岛的时期是第二个阶段，在这个阶段对战俘频繁而大规模地制造了流血屠杀的暴行。美国侵略者为了要战俘“拒绝遣返”而进行煽动、迫害的阴谋，在战俘营中设置所谓“学校”，利用所谓教会及其工作人员，并由特务、打手建立了警察恐怖制度和各种反动恐怖集团，迫使战俘在强迫扣留他们的各种文件上签名盖章，写血书并接受刺画、刺字，强迫战俘喊反动口号，举行所谓支持“自愿遣返”的游行示威，对战俘施行“个别会面审问”，以各种残暴方法屠杀反抗者。美李匪军为掩护特务、打手们，而用机关枪、卡宾枪、火焰喷射器等向战俘营滥行射击。他们用坦克辗死战俘，并为强迫扣留八万名我方被俘人员而迫使战俘在南朝鲜各地移动。因而对战俘的大屠杀事件频繁发生。
    一九五二年六月到战俘遣返时期是第三个阶段，美国侵略者竭尽一切力量企图强迫扣留战俘，剥夺了战俘的一切自由，不择手段地加强了对战俘的恐怖暴行，因而在蜂岩岛、龙草岛等美方战俘营中也频繁地发生了对战俘的大屠杀事件。这种暴行是在大批有组织的部队的参加下进行的。
    由于美国侵略者的暴行，仅据朝鲜人民军归来人员揭发的材料，遭到杀害的朝鲜人民军被俘人员就有三万三千六百多名，受伤和残废的有数万名。
    报告书接着分类举出了美国侵略者对人民军被俘人员所制造的暴行中的一些带有代表性的实例。
    第二章：关于屠杀战俘
    报告书指出：一九五零年九月十五日，登陆仁川的美军装甲部队大尉海尔逊在仁川码头命令四十五名士兵以轻、重机关枪和步枪向一百五十多名战俘集中射击，把他们全部枪毙后丢入海中。一九五零年十月二十五日，美国第八军直属宪兵队大尉威廉率领美军宪兵到囚禁战俘的平壤司仓市场，把战俘二十九人拉到群众面前枪毙，威廉自己也用手枪参加射击。一九五零年十一月十五日，设在平壤纺织工厂等地点的临时集中营中的战俘，被剥了衣服和夺去携带品，当他们为了御寒取暖而聚集时，美军宪兵大尉及李承晚伪军向他们滥施射击，屠杀了一百四十九人。一九五零年十月二十八日，临时设在平壤教化所的美方战俘营内发生火灾，美军向从烈火中外逃的战俘滥施射击，结果一百多名战俘死亡，二十多名受重伤，另外，美军还枪毙了已从火灾中逃出来的战俘四十名。一九五零年十月二十四日到十二月十日，设在仁川少年监狱等处的临时收容所里的战俘被押解到几只运输船上，送往釜山，装载都超过定员好几倍，上船大部在深夜中进行，美李军并且强迫战俘跑步上船，因而掉入海中淹死的有五百名之多；在船底因窒息而死的有一百五十多人；在航行中由于口渴、饥饿而得病、死亡以至被丢入海中的战俘，每只船都约有一百名。一九五零年十一月八日，美军驻东莱第四联队宪兵大尉指示美军士兵殴打因被强迫劳动而精疲力尽的战俘南宫一等九人，并当众用十轮大卡车把他们辗死。一九五零年十一月十五日，警备东莱战俘营的美军二等上士在强迫战俘进行扩大釜山军用飞机场的劳役时，命令李衡九等十七名战俘坐下后，用炸药炸死了其中的十五人，并使附近的十名战俘受重伤。一九五零年十二月二十四日晚间，美军在釜山第三码头强迫战俘搬运食品，殴打了金洛水等九名战俘，并把他们枪杀或丢入海中。一九五一年一月三十日，釜山第三码头美军粮食仓库着火，美军九十四宪兵大队长哈因基中校率领美军一百多人赶到现场，强迫在进行劳役的战俘去救火，当场枪毙了战俘七人，打伤了十二人。一九五一年三月十五日晚间，美军在巨济岛第六十一号战俘营，用辗石机把重病战俘李基铉辗死。
    第三章：关于战俘困难的生活条件
    报告书指出：美国侵略者违反国际法的要求，在卫生、健康的起码条件和供给宿舍、饮水及衣类等方面，都以惨无人道的手段对待战俘，甚至用恐怖手段回答战俘的正当要求，一直到细小的问题。例如一九五零年十一月六日到十二月二十七日，美国侵略者以平壤纺织工厂为临时集中营，收容了约三千名战俘。在这座被严重破坏的建筑物里，根本没有防寒防雨和卫生设备，供给的食物极坏，水也不能按时喝，洗脸洗手更不可能，战俘中因而发生了传染病，很多人死亡。在十一月十日到二十三日的十多天中，就有杨仁培等十五名战俘病死。一九五零年十二月到一九五一年三月，美军当局在釜山飞机场附近水田里架设帐篷，收容了战俘约三万多名，强迫他们作苦役并遭受寒冷和风吹雨打，结果得病者占总人数的五分之四，加以绝大多数患病者得不到治疗上的帮助，结果，仅美军第四大队管辖下的一个战俘营里的六千名战俘中，患重病的人就有一千四百多名，每天平均有七、八人死亡。一九五一年一月一日，美军强迫战俘在釜山第三码头卸运粮食，并把其中二十名丢入海里淹死。一九五一年初到三月底，美军迫使八千多名战俘修筑水原飞机场。由于遭受虐待，仅在二月份，就有三十多名战俘在现场死亡，三百八十名患重病，十七名受伤，一百五十名入医院后有二十九人死亡。美军强迫釜山西面第五战俘营内的战俘作船上卸货劳役，在一九五零年十二月二十三日把七十名战俘打伤，把五名投入海中淹死。
    第四章：关于蹂躏和剥夺战俘的人权和自由
    报告书举例说：由于美军当局强迫巨济岛所有的战俘营张贴反共标语，挂“韩国”、美国和联合国旗，组织反动组织，并指示特务杀害不信宗教的战俘，第七十八号战俘营的战俘提出了抗议，结果十多名战俘被无理拘禁。当战俘提出释放被拘禁者的要求时，美方竟动员美李匪军在一九五一年九月十七日包围战俘营营场，用枪支和手榴弹杀害了三十八名战俘，杀伤了一百九十四名，同时把五百八十五名战俘投入监狱。一九五一年圣诞节，美李匪军又强迫巨济岛战俘营挂美方旗帜，并包围袭击第七十三号战俘营，战俘因表示反对而被杀害的七名，负重伤的四十七名，被监禁的九百零二名。一九五二年一月二十五日，釜山第十二野战医院第六收容所所长根据远东美军司令部的指示，强迫八名被俘军医作广播以协助他们抵赖美军在朝鲜进行细菌战的罪行。战俘拒绝这样做，都遭到监禁和殴打。一九五二年九月二十七日到十月三日，美军对巨济岛第十四号战俘营进行搜查，并打伤了反对搜查的战俘二千八百多名，拘禁了二百三十五名。一九五三年五月一日在巨济岛第一号战俘营中进行搜查，又打伤了战俘八名。一九五一年“八·一五”，美军在巨济岛第六十二号战俘营中开枪打死了唱朝鲜解放歌曲的战俘三名，打伤了二十七名；在巨济岛第一至第十一号战俘营中打死了庆祝节日的战俘四十四名。一九五一年九月十八日，美军宪兵又向战俘进行射击近一小时，打死战俘十三名。一九五三年“二·八”朝鲜人民军建军节日，巨济岛第十七号战俘营当局压制战俘的庆祝活动，并打死了唱歌的战俘四人。一九五三年三月九日，巨济岛第三战俘营的战俘被毒打，因为他们听到斯大林逝世的消息时，曾戴过孝。一九五三年四月十七日，龙草岛第三号战俘营通令战俘：如果拒绝脱掉人民军军帽或拒绝劳役都要受严厉惩处，当天下午，美军包围这个战俘营并投掷手榴弹一百五十多枚，屠杀了战俘十七名。
    第五章：关于对战俘的强迫扣留
    报告书指出：美国侵略者从进行侵略朝鲜战争的第一天起，就企图强迫扣留战俘。为此，他们向战俘进行强迫“甄别”，迫使战俘写“释放请愿书”，并在朝鲜停战谈判过程中制造了所谓“自愿遣返”的提案。自美方战俘营当局从一九五二年三月起对战俘进行“甄别”以来，美李刽子手及其特务们更屠杀了无数愿意返回故乡的战俘。一九五零年十二月初旬，釜山、巨济岛各战俘营医院的美军和李承晚特务，在美国陆军准将尼柯斯的直接指挥下，强迫病伤战俘写“释放请愿书”，并屠杀和毒打表示拒绝的战俘。仅第一医院，在十二月七日就有金文洙等八名战俘被杀害，有五十多名被打伤。一九五一年十月十五日，李承晚特务在巨济岛第六十至第六十八号战俘营中，迫使战俘签名承认是被扣留的平民，并屠杀了进行反抗的战俘八十多名，打伤了五百多名。一九五二年二月十八日，美军约一千名携带重机关枪等武器，包围了巨济岛第六十二号战俘营，因战俘不肯签名承认是平民，就对他们进行集中射击，杀害战俘一百零二名，打伤了二百六十多名。一九五二年三月十三日，美军军官指挥三百名美军、伪军和约一千名埋伏在各战俘营中的李承晚特务，袭击巨济岛第九十二号战俘营，战俘十三名被杀死，七十八名负重伤。一九五二年六月十日，战俘营总管美国陆军准将波纳，动员约四千多名美军对巨济岛第七十六号战俘营六千八百多名战俘连续进行四小时的袭击，结果二百七十六名战俘被杀害，四千名以上负伤。一九五二年四月七日，美军第九十四宪兵大队副官和随军牧师等把手枪七支和催泪弹等交给潜伏在巨济岛第七十六号战俘营中的特务金斗益，指示他不让一个战俘要求遣返；四月八日，特务们便用手枪屠杀了一百七十多名战俘；同一天，巨济岛第八十一号战俘营的美军军官和随军牧师也指使特务屠杀了要求回北朝鲜的战俘九十多名。四月九日，巨济岛第八十三号战俘营当局对六千四百多名战俘强迫进行“甄别”，屠杀了战俘五十多名，活埋了六十名；第七十三号战俘营当局指使特务用铁锹、锄头等打死了战俘二十七名。四月十二日，巨济岛第七十一号战俘营也屠杀了战俘一百二十五名以上。四月八日，美军第九十四宪兵大队协同李伪军警备队，在巨济岛第九十三号战俘营屠杀了要求回北朝鲜的战俘七十二名。四月十日，巨济岛第九十一号战俘营一百五十名战俘被屠杀，第九十四号战俘营内用棍子打死了三十四名战俘。四月十四日，巨济岛第一号战俘营也有战俘赵仁洙等八名被打死。
    第六章：关于对女战俘的暴行
   报告书指出：美军不仅不考虑到女战俘的生理条件和卫生保健工作，而且施以各种虐待、拷问，甚至以刀枪逼着她们裸体游街，或加以强奸后把她们杀害。仅据提供材料的七十名归来人员的叙述，被美军强奸的女战俘就有一百二十八名，强奸未遂而被杀害的有三十四名，美军强奸后为掩盖罪恶加以杀害的有四十四名，因其他理由而被杀害的有一百二十名，负伤的有一百三十名。例如：一九五零年十月十六日，在黄海道谷山郡，一个美军宪兵大尉指挥李伪军二军团的宪兵中尉拷打和强奸女战俘金仁淑，并在十八日上午把她枪杀。一九五零年十月二十八日，在平安南道顺川的美军野战医院中，美军把赵英姬等五名女战俘剥光衣服，浇上汽油烧死。一九五二年四月，巨济岛美军第六十四野战医院里的美军下士丁尼等凌辱了从釜山移送来的许多女战俘。一九五零年十月十四日，八十名男女战俘从议政府向汉城移送，途中有两名女战俘被美军枪杀，到汉城时，美军并强迫战俘们裸体游街。一九五零年十月五日，美军在倭馆车站把女战俘金爱子拖进一空车厢中强奸，并在车站旁边把她枪杀。一九五二年八月五日晚，巨济岛美军六十四野战医院收容所所长梅里逊强奸有病的女战俘金贞淑未遂，用手枪把她打死。一九五二年三月十日，釜山一○○号战俘营第二收容所情报科的美军，因女战俘姜占淑、郑贞顺不肯充当护士，把她们拷打了六个钟头，姜占淑当场被打死。
    第七章：关于对病伤战俘的虐待和医学实验
    报告书指出：仅据提供材料的三百七十六名归来人员的叙述，被这样杀害的人民军战俘达二千零一十八名，残废的达一千一百一十六名，例如：一九五零年九月二十五日，战俘晁勇国左腿关节部折伤，在二十六日被俘，十月二十日被拘留在釜山第一战俘营中，被作为医学实验，经五次截肢，左腿下半截完全丧失。一九五零年十月十三日，赵民宪在江原道洪川以北左膊和左腿受伤后被俘，美军不但不给治疗，反而故意割去他伤处的骨骼作接骨用的材料。一九五零年十月六日，姜中淑在元山市左趾及左腿下部被美军机枪打伤，美军对她进行五次截肢，使她成了残废。美军第十四野战医院外科主任美军少校拉斯金并把战俘中的许多患者作为实验对象，施行肺部手术，战俘不愿意，他便唆使特务加以殴打，当战俘被打得神志不清时，他便动手术，被施手术者全部死亡。这个医院的实验室主任还对患者进行各种药物的实验。由于没有予以治疗而死亡的战俘的人数更多。美军第十四野战医院当局为使传染病蔓延，根本不隔离赤痢病患者，因而从一九五零年十月到一九五一年五月，染上赤痢而死亡的每天有二十多人，一九五零年十一月二十三日那一天就死了九十一名。由于同一原因，第四号战俘营在八个月中也有二千多名战俘死亡。在这个设在釜山巨济里的第四号战俘营内，从一九五零年十月十五日到一九五一年二月底为止，由于美军故意不给治疗而死亡的战俘达六千七百多名。自一九五零年十二月到一九五一年三月为止，在釜山第一、二、三、四、五号医院中因没有治疗而病死的战俘也达九百六十名。
    第八章：关于对战俘进行武器性能的实验
    报告书指出：美军当局还对战俘进行武器性能的实验，其中包括原子武器性能的实验。一九五零年十一月十六日，釜山巨济里一○○号战俘营所属第七收容所，收容了从仁川、丹阳等地送来的人民军战俘约二千多名。二十日上午十时，美军用卡车把三百多名炮兵战俘强迫运往六公里外的一个山脚下，令他们坐下或躺下，然后以预先布置好的坦克和重机枪等向他们集中射击，全部加以杀害，以实验武器的杀伤力与射击的准确性。一九五二年七月七日，巨济岛战俘营总管波纳带领两个军医，把第四大队收容的战俘一百二十名运到离巨济岛第一码头约三公里的地点，进行约四小时的毒气实验，使这些战俘在此后两个月中不能睁开眼睛。一九五二年十二月三十日，美国飞机一架在巨济岛第十七号战俘营第四大队宿舍上空投下一个纸筒，纸筒在空中张开；接着，第四大队全体人员都患了眼疾，此后每个星期都有军医前来调查眼疾情况。一九五二年八月十三日，美军把战俘五百多名赶进铁丝围笼，以两个小队的兵力向围笼里投掷一千多颗毒气弹，进行实验，结果三百五十多名战俘负重伤，四十四名丧失意识，四名死亡，三名丧失听觉，六名完全失明。一九五一年五月中旬，在离巨济岛第二码头约一哩的海面上，美国侵略者装运战俘一千五百名出海他往，进行原子弹性能的实验。这是当时被迫在码头上搬运物资的其他二十五名战俘亲眼看见这些战俘被运走，并听监视他们的李伪军下士杨寅陪说的。一九五零年十月二十三日夜间，美军军官和士兵把釜山战俘营所属西面收容所的战俘八百多名，以一艘可容五千人的美军灰色运输船从釜山第三码头运走，下落不明。
    第九章：结论
    报告书在结论中指出：以上各种事实，是经过公正的科学的调查而确定的事实中的极少的一部分。然而由此也可以看出美国侵略军对人民军被俘人员施行野蛮的罪恶行为的全部真相，并且证明了美军这种有组织、有计划的暴行，是按照美国军阀和统治集团的头子的直接指示进行的。美国侵略者横暴地违反一九零七年海牙章程中关于战俘待遇的规定和一九二七年及一九四九年关于战俘待遇的日内瓦公约等国际法规的行为，在人类历史上留下了最可耻的一页。在朝鲜制造这种种血腥暴行的犯罪者，是绝对逃脱不了它的罪责的。全世界人民以愤怒和激动的心情谴责这些犯罪者，并要求立即惩处对英雄的朝鲜人民和对朝鲜人民军被俘人员施以非人暴行的美国侵略者。（新华社）
