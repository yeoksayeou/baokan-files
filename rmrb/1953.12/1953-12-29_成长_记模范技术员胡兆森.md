    Growth
    ——A Record of Model Technician Hu Zhaosen
  　By our reporter Zhu Bo
    In the various construction sites of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's blast furnace project, there are many young students from all over the country. They have only worked here for a little over a year and have become capable technical personnel. From their thinking, you cannot find bourgeois technical viewpoints, nor can you see where they are detached from the workers. Regardless of the circumstances, they can very modestly learn advanced technology from Soviet experts and absorb the valuable practical experience of the workers. Therefore, these outstanding young people have achieved continuous victories in the construction cause.
    If you didn't know them, it would be difficult to recognize them as young technical personnel. Hu Zhaosen from the Power and Electrical Section is like this. When he is with the workers, you would think he is a skilled worker. His clothing is similar to the workers, and he can work skillfully no matter what tools he holds. When you see him discussing work with Soviet experts, he can speak fluently with the experts in Russian, and then you would think he is a translator for the Soviet experts. However, you will certainly see many technical personnel on the construction site come to him to study the technical problems that occur in the project. Only when you inquire in detail do you realize that Hu Zhaosen is the leader of the technical team of the Power and Electrical Section and the technical person in charge of the entire turbine blower installation work.
    In the autumn of 1951, Hu Zhaosen, not long after graduating from Shanghai Jiaotong University, was assigned to the turbine blower section to work as a technician. At the time, he was very excited, thinking: The motherland has cultivated me, and I should contribute my strength to the construction of the motherland. However, the reality was not as he imagined, because the machines were the latest type, and many more skilled technical personnel had not seen this new type of turbine blower. They also felt difficult to install this new type of machine, which was even more difficult for Hu Zhaosen, who had just put down his books. When he first arrived at the construction site, he couldn't even name the parts of the machine. However, since you are a technician, the workers will rely on you and accept your technical guidance. The workers were all watching him with wide eyes, eager for Hu Zhaosen to help them carry out the installation work. Many workers asked him more than once, "Old Hu, shall we start?" "We have never seen this new machine before, so tell us what to do and we'll do it." Hu Zhaosen was very worried and thought to himself: The workers are all watching me, the technician, but what about myself? Although I went to school for more than ten years, I can't even name the parts of the machine, I'm really not as good as the workers, who can do something when they pick up a tool. What should I do? There is only one way, and that is to learn. There are many brilliant teachers in front of me, and as long as I am willing to work hard, I will overcome this difficulty. He took the initiative to talk to the workers, understand their thoughts and opinions on the project, and carefully study the machine drawings himself. When he had difficulties, he consulted Soviet experts. Later, he also suggested to the leadership to set up a turbine blower professional training class according to the workers' requirements. This would allow all personnel to become familiar with the new turbine blower, which would be of great help to the installation work. The leadership approved this suggestion and assigned him to be responsible for the work of the training class. The specific plans and technical theoretical problems relied on Soviet experts to help solve.
    After all the personnel studied in the professional training class, although they became more familiar with this new type of machine, they still felt it was difficult to install such a precise machine. Therefore, a technical training class was established to specifically solve the installation technical problems of the turbine blower. Through these two training classes, Soviet advanced experience educated the workers and also profoundly educated Hu Zhaosen himself. It made him affirm in his mind that Soviet technology is the most advanced in the world. He realized that the main factor why Soviet science and technology can achieve such profound achievements is the Soviet scientific and technological workers' high degree of love for their motherland and their love for labor. Hu Zhaosen often measured himself according to the Soviet experts and required himself to do the same. He said to himself more than once: "What are the Soviet experts for? What force motivates them to do this? Besides the Soviet people who have a high degree of internationalism, I am afraid that no one else in the world can be found."
    In this way, Hu Zhaosen's thinking became clearer about learning from Soviet experts. He realized that he must resolutely implement the suggestions of Soviet experts. Whether he can implement the suggestions of Soviet experts is directly related to the quality of the project and whether he can accept Soviet advanced experience. Therefore, every time a Soviet expert made a suggestion, he would first study it himself. After his own thinking was clear, he would explain it to the workers. If some people could not accept it for a while, he would repeatedly explain it to the workers so that everyone could understand the benefits of this suggestion and everyone could happily implement it. For example, when grinding the front bearing, the front bearing must be turned over. According to the past experience of the riggers, such a huge machine requires two steel wire ropes to tie the machine, and it takes two or three hours. The Soviet expert, Guoliang, believed that the old method was too clumsy. He suggested that only one steel wire rope should be used to turn it over and told the workers how to turn the bearing with one steel wire rope. At that time, Wang Weiren, who was responsible for this work, believed that it was not safe to turn the bearing with one steel wire rope and insisted on using the old method. Hu Zhaosen patiently persuaded him, saying: "We should believe in the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Comrade Guoliang has installed more than 20 new turbine blowers and all of them work in this way. There is no need to worry, it will definitely be done well." He also told Wang Weiren in detail the advantages of this new method, and finally convinced him.
    Another time, it was about changing the shroud on the turbine blower. The shroud was slightly damaged during transportation, but it could still be used. In order to ensure the quality of the installation, the Soviet expert suggested replacing it with a new shroud. However, the workers and individual leaders did not agree ideologically. Their reasons were: The shroud is not badly damaged and can still be used. At the same time, everyone has not changed the shroud before and lacks experience in this area. If the shroud is damaged due to improper replacement, it is better not to replace it. Hu Zhaosen and the Soviet expert studied the situation. He mobilized the workers and said that for the long-term plan, it is better to replace the bad shroud. If there are technical problems in the replacement, the Soviet experts will help to find a solution. Moreover, after this work, we can also learn the technology of replacing the shroud. If we do not replace the shroud now because of technical difficulties, when will we have the opportunity to learn the technology of replacing the shroud? What if the shroud has a problem and affects the production of the machine? Wouldn't it be more difficult to replace it then? After his persuasion, the workers ideologically realized the correctness of this suggestion and consciously completed this complex task under the guidance of Soviet experts.
    Because of Hu Zhaosen's serious work attitude, the suggestions put forward by the Soviet experts were implemented, so that the quality of the turbine blower installation project reached the first-class standard and the task was completed ahead of schedule. For this reason, he received commendation from the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League and gloriously attended the Northeast Region Basic Construction Advanced Workers Conference.
    The honor Hu Zhaosen gained for his achievements in work made him feel very uneasy. He said, "I am just a young student who has just started working. Without the help of the organization, the guidance of Soviet experts, and the selfless labor of the workers, what could I have done?" Sometimes he thought to himself: Our country is like this, as long as you have some achievements in your work, the people will encourage you in many ways. Therefore, Hu Zhaosen demanded himself more strictly and checked which aspects he had not done well enough in order to make more achievements for the people.
    Hu Zhaosen often thought: He is too far behind in technical theoretical level and is not as good as a worker in practical work. Especially when he is with Soviet experts, seeing that Soviet experts not only master a high degree of technical theory, but also can do a job as soon as they pick up a tool. This made him deeply feel that a technical personnel of New China must take the Soviet technical personnel as an example and must learn to be both literate and martial. This idea prompted him to work hard to learn practical work skills and experience from workers, and pay attention to cultivating old workers so that old workers can become literate and martial people.
    He successively educated old workers Gu Chengshan, Li Chengjun, Su Zhongxiao and other old fitters on technical theory and received their help. In addition to taking on a certain amount of daily courses, he sometimes personally ran to the workers' dormitories to teach the workers. He taught in two ways, one is to systematically explain technical theory in his spare time. Such as the structural principle of the turbine blower, the operating principle of the turbine blower, and the mathematical knowledge that a technical personnel should have, etc. The other is to teach what you do at work, explain the principle of the servo motor when installing the servo motor, and even explain the function of a screw when installing a screw. For example, when installing the "steady nail" on the base of a certain turbine blower, he asked Gu Chengshan: "What is the function of the 'steady nail' on the base?" Old Gu could not answer, so he explained: "The 'steady nail' is the anchor point of the turbine blower, and its function is to ensure the stability of the machine's centering." This teaching method is very popular among the workers, because it is easy to explain the truth clearly and the workers can easily remember it. Moreover, in the actual work, he also learned practical work skills from the workers. He learned whatever tools he saw. Of course, it was not easy for him to learn these skills. For example, when learning to hit the hand hammer, his hands were swollen. When learning the technology of the file, he saw that the worker could file the plane on the screw in a few strokes, but when he took the file, he could not file a plane. Later, he filed a plane, but the size was wrong again. Hu Zhaosen spent a lot of effort to learn these skills. He practiced whenever he had time on the construction site, so that he finally mastered the technology of the fitter.
    Hu Zhaosen has been very silent these days. But this does not mean that he is like this at work. Every day he still works with the workers as usual. If other technicians have problems and come to him, he is still very enthusiastic to study solutions with the technicians. Only during breaks, he is often seen sitting alone in the room in contemplation, writing "water" on a piece of waste paper with a pencil. Many people on the construction site do not know why this young technician, who is loved by them, is so silent. Many people thought to themselves: Is Xiao Hu in a bad mood? This is unfounded, because everyone knows that Hu Zhaosen has never been in a bad mood since he came here to work, and it is even less likely now. The installation of the turbine blower has been completed according to the original scheduled project progress, and the quality of the machine installation has been guaranteed. So why is he so silent? Only the Soviet experts and the translator Lao Yang know about this matter.
    It turned out that the turbine blower was installed, and many people were excited about their new achievements, because the completion of the turbine blower is a strong guarantee for blast furnace production. However, things are not as smooth as people think. Although the turbine blower is installed, the construction of the circulating water pump station that supplies water to the turbine blower is lagging behind. In this way, the turbine blower cannot be produced because there is no water pump station to supply water. Hu Zhaosen and the Soviet experts had talked about this issue several times, but they had not come up with a solution.
    Speaking of the construction of the circulating water pump station, it is really worrying. The construction of the circulating water pump station was originally planned to be completed in November, but it has been delayed due to many problems encountered in the middle. At the beginning, it was because the original data was incorrect and the amount of work was underestimated, and the design was repeatedly done seven or eight times. It was not until September that the construction officially started. Less than a few days after the construction started, many problems were encountered again: for example, there were many high-voltage power lines of the power plant on the foundation of the water pump station that needed to be moved; there were also many cables to be moved underground. Before these two things were completed, a thick water pipe was found in the foundation of the water pump station. To construct, the water pipe must be cut off. Cutting off the water pipe will affect the production of the power plant. The only way is to block the water and then cut off the water pipe so that it will not affect the production of the power plant. However, there were also great difficulties in blocking the water, and the project period was delayed for a long time to study the water blocking problem. Now that the problem has been solved, the water problem cannot be solved, because the construction of the circulating water pump station will not be completed until February or March 1954. However, a certain blast furnace cannot wait until February or March next year to be put into production, and there is also a blast furnace that has already started production and is waiting to replenish the air volume. In the past, because the air volume was not enough, more than 150 tons of iron were produced less every day. If the turbine blower cannot supply the blast furnace with air in time, the country will produce 1.7 billion yuan less every day, and another blast furnace will produce more than 150 tons of iron less every day.
    What to do? Hu Zhaosen has been silent these days because he wanted to find a way to solve the temporary water supply for the turbine blower.
    One day, when he passed the water tower of the power plant, he couldn't help but slow down and finally stood next to the water tower. This tall water tower reminded him that when he opened the professional training class, he had heard several old workers from the power plant say that the power plant has two water pumps, one of which is a spare. He said to himself: "Maybe I can find a way to solve the water problem for the turbine blower from the water pump of the power plant."
    In order to find out the water situation of the power plant, he went directly to the power plant to find the old workers Xu Guangzhi and Liu Hongshu. He said:
  "I want to inquire about the water problem of the power plant. I don't know if you understand it?" Xu Guangzhi said: "We know the water situation, and we will help you understand it even if we don't know it. The power plant has two water pumps, one is used regularly, and the other is only used in the summer when the weather is very hot, and the time is very short." Hu Zhaosen was excited when he heard this and shook Lao Xu's hand tightly and said: "There is a way, thank you for your help." Then he talked to Lao Xu about the problem of the turbine blower water pump station. Xu Guangzhi said: "It turns out that it is for the iron production of a certain blast furnace. As long as the water here can be used, I will help you with whatever you need to know."
    After Hu Zhaosen understood the water situation of the power plant, he went to find the Soviet experts. The Soviet experts considered the situation based on what Hu Zhaosen said and believed that this was a very valuable suggestion and encouraged him to further understand the situation. Hu Zhaosen went to the power plant again. He learned the water temperature from Xu Guangzhi. Xu Guangzhi said: "From autumn to late spring, the temperature of the water coming out of the cooling tower is 15 degrees Celsius. After being used by the generator, the water temperature rises to about 21 degrees. In summer, because of the climate, the water temperature rises and the cooling is slow, and the two water pumps are used in rotation." Hu Zhaosen thought about the water situation of the turbine blower and said: "If this is the case, the water used by the generator can still be used by the turbine blower. Because the water used by the turbine blower can be used as long as it is below 25 degrees Celsius." After he understood these situations, he discussed it with Director Hou of the power plant. Director Hou completely agreed with his suggestion. He said: "The construction of the circulating water pump station will be completed between February and March next year. Let the water from the power plant be no problem first."
    This suggestion is already certain. As long as the water pipe inlet of the turbine blower and the water pipe outlet of the generator are connected, the problem is solved. Hu Zhaosen wrote a detailed report and designed a project drawing of the water pipe connection, and sent it to the leadership.
    At that time, the leaders were worried about the water problem of the turbine blower. Now that there is such a suggestion, of course they are very satisfied. With this suggestion, the suggestion was sent to the Soviet experts for research. After research and review by all parties, the suggestion was approved and quickly implemented.
    For this suggestion, the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League called on all members of the Communist Youth League to learn from Hu Zhaosen's spirit of highly dedicating himself to the construction of the motherland. The Anshan Iron and Steel Company allocated five million yuan as a reward to Comrade Hu Zhaosen.

    成长
    ——记模范技术员胡兆森
  　本报记者　朱波
    在鞍钢高炉工程公司各个工地上，有很多从祖国各地来的青年学生。他们在这里工作了只有一年多的时间，就成为能文能武的技术人员。从他们的思想里，你找不到资产阶级的技术观点，也看不出他们在什么地方有脱离工人的现象。不管在什么情况下，他们都能很虚心地向苏联专家学习先进技术，吸取工人们的宝贵的实际工作经验。因此，这些优秀青年们在建设事业中获得连续的胜利。
    你如果不知道他们，就很难认出他们是青年技术人员。动电工段的胡兆森就是这样。当他和工人在一起，你会认为他是一个技术工人。他的服装和工人差不多，不管他手里拿着什么工具，都能够很熟练地工作；当你看到他和苏联专家在一起商量工作时，他能够很流利地用俄语和专家讲话，这时你又会认为他是苏联专家的翻译。但是，你一定又会看见工地上很多技术人员来找他，和他研究工程上发生的技术问题。当你详细打听一下，才知道胡兆森是动电工段技术组长，是整个透平鼓风机安装工作上的技术负责人。
    一九五一年秋天，胡兆森从上海交通大学毕业不久，就分配到透平鼓风机工段担任技术员的工作。当时他非常兴奋，他想：祖国把自己培养出来了，应该好好为祖国建设贡献出自己的力量。但是，事实却不是如他想像的那样，因为机器是最新型的，很多更高明的技术人员都没有看见过这种新型的透平鼓风机，他们也都为安装这种新型的机器而感到困难，这对刚刚放下书本的胡兆森来说就更加困难了。他刚到工地时，连机器零件的名称都说不出来。但是，你既然是技术员，工人们就要依靠你，接受你在技术上的指导。工人都睁着眼睛望着他，都渴望着胡兆森帮助他们进行安装工作。很多工人不止一次地问他说：“老胡同志，开始吗？”“咱们可没有见过这种新式机器，你说怎么办我们就怎么做。”胡兆森很发愁，自己暗暗地想：工人都在看着我这个技术员，我自己呢？虽然上了十几年学校，连机器零件名称都叫不来，真不如工人，工人拿起工具来还可以干两下哩。怎么办呢？办法只有一个，就是学习。眼前有很多高明的老师，只要肯努力，会把这一难关渡过的。他主动地找工人去谈心，了解他们的思想情况和对工程的意见，并且自己仔细地研究机器图样，有了困难时就请教苏联专家。后来，他又根据工人们的要求，向领导上建议成立透平鼓风机专业学习班。这样可以使全体人员都能熟悉一下新式透平鼓风机的情况，这对安装工作会有很大的作用。领导上批准了这个建议，就派他负责这个学习班的工作，具体的计划和技术理论上的疑难问题，依靠苏联专家帮助解决。
    全体人员经过专业学习班学习后，虽然对这种新式的机器熟悉了些，但是对安装如此精密的机器，还是感觉很困难。因此，又成立了一个技术训练班，专门解决透平鼓风机的安装技术问题。经过这两次训练班的学习，苏联先进经验教育了工人，也深刻地教育了胡兆森自己。使他思想上肯定下苏联技术是世界上最高明的，他认识到苏联的科学技术所以能够达到如此高深的成就，主要因素是苏联的科学技术工作者高度地热爱祖国、热爱劳动的精神。胡兆森常常按照苏联专家那样来衡量自己，要求自己也这样去做。他不止一次地对自己说：“苏联专家为了什么？什么力量促使他们这样做？除具有高度国际主义精神的苏联人民，世界上恐怕再也找不到什么人来了。”
    这样一来，胡兆森思想上更加明确了向苏联专家学习，自己必须坚决执行苏联专家的建议，能否执行苏联专家的建议，直接关系着工程的质量，关系到能否接受苏联先进经验，因此，每次当苏联专家提出建议时，自己就先进行研究，等自己思想明确后，再向工人进行解释；如果有些人一时接受不了时，他就反复向工人解释，要每个人都能够懂得这一项建议的好处，使工人都能够愉快地去执行。譬如进行前轴承的研磨工作，必须把前轴承翻过来，根据架工过去的经验，像这样巨大的机器需要两条钢丝绳把机器捆住才行，并且需要两、三个钟头的时间，苏联专家国良认为老方法太笨，他提出：只要用一条钢丝绳来翻就可以了，并把用一条钢丝绳翻轴承的方法告诉工人，当时负责这个工作的是架工王维仁，他认为用一条钢丝绳翻轴承不保险，仍坚持要用老方法，胡兆森耐心地动员他说：“我们应该相信苏联的先进经验，国良同志安装过二十多台新式透平鼓风机，都是用这种方法工作的，用不着耽心，一定会做好的。”又把这一新方法的好处详细告诉王维仁，终于说服了他。
    还有一次是换透平鼓风机上的围带。围带在运送时碰坏了一点，但是还可以使用，苏联专家为了保证安装的质量，建议重新换一个新围带。但是工人和个别的领导人员思想上都不同意，他们的理由是：围带坏的不多还可以使用，同时，大家都没有换过围带，缺乏这方面的经验，如果换不好把围带弄坏了，还不如不换好。胡兆森和苏联专家研究了这一情况，他就动员工人说，为了百年大计还是把坏围带换下来，如果换的技术上有问题，苏联专家帮助想办法，而且经过这次工作后，我们还可以学会换围带的技术。现在如果因为技术上的困难不换围带，以后什么时候才有机会学会换围带的技术呢？万一围带出了毛病而影响了机器的生产，那时候再换不是更困难了吗？经过他的说服，工人们从思想上认识到这一建议的正确，都自觉地在苏联专家指导下，完成了这一复杂的任务。
    由于胡兆森这样认真的工作态度，苏联专家所提出的建议都执行了，使得安装透平鼓风机工程的质量达到一级标准，并提前完成了任务。为此，他得到青年团鞍山市团委会的表扬，并光荣地出席了东北区基本建设先进工作者大会。
    因为胡兆森在工作上的成就所获得的荣誉，使他的心里感到很不安，他说：“我只是刚刚参加工作的一个青年学生，如果没有组织上的帮助，苏联专家的指教，以及工人同志们忘我地劳动，我能够做出什么来呢？”有时他暗暗地想：我们的国家就是这样，只要你在工作上有点成绩，人民就会多方面鼓励你。因此，胡兆森就更严格地要求自己，检查自己那些方面还作得不够，以便为人民做出更多的成绩。
    胡兆森经常这样想：自己在技术理论水平上相差太远，在实际工作上还不如一个工人，特别当他和苏联专家在一起的时候，看见苏联专家不仅掌握了高度的技术理论，而且随便拿起一件工具来就能干一阵。这使他深深地感到，一个新中国的技术人员，一定要以苏联的技术人员为榜样，必须学会能文能武。这种思想促使他努力向工人学习实际工作的技术和经验，并注意培养老工人，使老工人成为能文能武的人。
    他先后对老工人顾成山、李成君、苏忠孝等老钳工进行技术理论的教育，并从中得到他们的帮助。他除了担负每天一定时间的课程外，有时还亲自跑到工人宿舍里去教工人。他教课的方法有两种，一种是利用业余时间系统地讲技术理论。如透平鼓风机的构造原理、透平鼓风机的操作原理和一个技术人员应该具备的数学知识等；另一种是在工作中，做什么教什么，安装司服马达时，就讲司服马达的原理，甚至安装一个螺丝钉也要讲一讲这一个螺丝钉的作用。譬如在安装某号透平鼓风机机座上的“稳钉”时，他就问顾成山：“机座上的‘稳钉’起什么作用？”老顾回答不上来，他就解释说：“‘稳钉’是透平鼓风机的锚点，它的作用就是保证机器定心的稳定。”这种教学方法非常受工人欢迎，因为这样很容易把道理讲明白，工人容易记住。而且就在实际工作中，他也向工人学习了实际工作技术，看见什么工具就学什么。当然，他学习这些技术也是很不容易的，譬如学打手锤，把手都打肿了，学习锉刀的技术时，看到工人三两下就把螺丝上的平面锉出来了，而自己拿锉来，总是锉不成平面，后来锉成了，但是尺寸又不对了。胡兆森为学习这些技术花费了很多心血，在工地上，只要有时间就练习。使他终于掌握了钳工的技术。
    胡兆森这几天表现很沉默。但这不是说他在工作上这样，每天他仍然像往常一样和工人一起工作；其他技术员有问题找他来，他仍然很热心地和技术员一起研究解决的办法。只是在休息时，常见他一个人坐在房子里沉思，用铅笔在一块废纸上写满了“水”字。工地上很多人都不知道这位为他们所爱戴的青年技术员为了什么事情，表现这样沉默。很多人暗暗地想：小胡在闹情绪吗？这是没有根据的，因为大家都知道胡兆森从来这里工作没有闹过情绪，目前更不可能，透平鼓风机的安装工作按照原规定的工程的进度完成了，而且保证了机器安装的质量。那么他到底为什么这样沉默呢？这件事情只有苏联专家和翻译老杨知道。
    原来事情是这样的，透平鼓风机安装起来了，很多人为自己新的成就而兴奋，因为透平鼓风机的竣工，对高炉生产是一个有力保证。但是，事情并不像人们所想的那么顺利，透平鼓风机虽然安装好了，供应透平鼓风机用水的循环水泵站的工程却落后了。这样透平鼓风机就因为没有水泵站供应水而不能生产。这个问题胡兆森和苏联专家曾谈过数次，也没有研究出一个解决的办法。
    提起循环水泵站的工程，也真使人伤脑筋。循环水泵站的工程原计划在十一月竣工，但是，因为当中遇到很多问题，一直拖延下来了。开始是因为原始资料不正确和对工程量估计不足，曾反复做过七、八次设计，一直到九月份才正式开始施工。在施工刚刚开始不到几天，又遇到很多问题：譬如水泵站基础上有发电厂的很多高压电线要移动；在地下还有很多电缆要搬家。这两件事情还没有完成，就又发现水泵站的基础里有一根粗大的水管。要施工就要切断水管，截断水管就会影响发电厂的生产，唯一的办法是把水堵住再截断水管，这样可以不影响发电厂的生产。但是在堵水问题上也发生了很大的困难，为了研究堵水问题又把工程期限拖延了很久。现在问题虽然解决了，但是还不能解决水的问题，因为循环水泵站的工程要等到一九五四年二、三月间才能竣工。可是，某号高炉不能等到明年二、三月间才投入生产，而且还有一座已经开始生产的高炉也等着补充风量。过去就是因为风量不够而每天少生产一百五十多吨铁。如果透平鼓风机不能及时供应高炉用风，每天就少给国家生产十七亿元，另外一个高炉就每天少生产一百五十多吨铁。
    怎么办呢？胡兆森这几天就是为了想一个解决透平鼓风机临时用水的办法，而表现得沉默了。
    有一天，他路过发电厂的水塔时，不由得就放慢了脚步，最后站在水塔旁边。这高大的水塔使他回忆起他开办专业学习班的时候，曾听到发电厂的几个老工人说过。发电厂有两台水泵，其中有一台是备品。他自言自语地说：“说不定从发电厂的水泵上，找到解决透平鼓风机的用水办法。”
    为了把发电厂的用水情况弄清楚，他就直接跑到发电厂去找老工人徐广智和刘洪书去了。他说：
  “我想打听一下发电厂的用水问题，不知道你们了解不？”徐广智说：“我们知道用水的情况，就是不知道也会帮助你了解清楚的。发电厂共有两台水泵，经常使用一台，另一台是在夏季里，天气很热的情况下才使用，用的时间很短。”胡兆森听说后就兴奋地握紧老徐的手说：“有办法了，谢谢你的帮助。”紧接着又把透平鼓风机水泵站的问题对老徐谈了谈。徐广智说：“原来是为了某高炉出铁的事呵，只要能使用这里的水，你需要了解什么情况，我也会帮助你的。”
    胡兆森了解了发电厂的用水情况后，就去找苏联专家。苏联专家根据胡兆森谈的情况考虑了一下，认为这是很有价值的一项建议。并鼓励他进一步去了解情况。胡兆森又到发电厂去了一次，他从徐广智那里了解了水的温度。徐广智说：“从秋季到春末，冷却塔出来的水的温度是摄氏十五度。经过发电机用过后水温提高到二十一度左右。夏季，因为气候的关系，水温提高了，而且也冷却的慢，两台水泵轮流着使用。”胡兆森根据透平鼓风机用水的情况想了想说：“如果是这样，发电机用过的水，透平鼓风机还可以使用。因为透平鼓风机的用水，只要在摄氏二十五度以下就可以使用。”他了解这些情况后，又和发电厂的侯厂长商量了一下，侯厂长完全同意他这个建议，他说：“明年二、三月间循环水泵站的工程就完成了，先使发电厂的水没有问题。”
    这项建议已经有把握了，只要把透平鼓风机的水管入口处和发电机水管的出口处接通，问题就解决了，胡兆森写了一个详细的报告，并设计了一个接水管的工程图样，就送给领导上去了。
    当时领导同志正为透平鼓风机的用水问题发愁，现在有这样一个建议，当然很满意了。随着就把这项建议送苏联专家研究，经过各方面研究审查后，批准了这项建议，并且迅速地施工了。
    为了这项建议，鞍山市团市委号召全体青年团员学习胡兆森这种高度为了祖国建设的精神，鞍山钢铁公司拨款五百万作为对胡兆森同志的奖励。
