Let us Accelerate the Industrialization of the Motherland with Great Actions
— A Letter from Pu Tingzhen, Industrial Labor Model of Gansu Province, to Wang Jinzhong
Comrade Wang Jinzhong, Model Captain of the Concrete Team:

The news of your victorious construction of Anshan Iron and Steel Complex (Angang) with the support of the people of the whole country has brought us endless strength, and also brought us supreme glory and pride. Because: Angang is supporting the basic construction of heavy industry in various parts of the motherland; Angang is accelerating the process of industrialization of the motherland.

Dear Comrade Jinzhong: The factory where I am located - the Gansu Daily Printing Factory - is of course too small compared to Angang. However, with the victorious progress of Angang and the construction of the whole country, our printing factory, our newspaper, and all our employees are undergoing great changes in all aspects. We originally used flatbed presses to print newspapers, which required seven machines, fourteen people, and seven hours to print the day's newspaper; now, we have started using rotary presses manufactured by our own country to print newspapers for the people of Gansu; currently, we only need five people to print the day's newspaper in two hours. Recently, we bought two more machines, all made of our own country's steel, manufactured by our own working class. When our employees saw them, some said: "Seeing our machines, we think of our Angang. With Angang, the future industrialization of the motherland is guaranteed!"

Now, our new newspaper printing machine has started printing newspapers, and the original flatbed presses can print more books and periodicals for the people; other business aspects have also expanded. In the fourth quarter, our planned task is 2.6 billion, with an increase in production and savings of 900 million, totaling 3.5 billion. Now we are trying our best to complete this plan to support the comrades building Angang.

In addition, we have established new workshops and new dormitories here. The number of our employees has increased fourfold compared to the beginning of liberation, and our ability to build the motherland has improved. But we know: this is just the beginning. Only by allowing our Angang to grow faster and accelerating the industrialization of the motherland can our political, economic, and cultural life achieve universal upsurge. Please write and tell us how you and your comrades are building our steel capital?

    让我们用伟大的行动加速祖国的工业化
    ——甘肃省工业劳动模范蒲廷珍给王进忠的信混凝土队模范队长王进忠同志：
    你们在全国人民支援下胜利建设鞍钢的消息，给我们带来了无穷无尽的力量，也给我们带来了无上的光荣和骄傲。因为：鞍钢，在支援祖国各地重工业的基本建设；鞍钢，在加速着祖国工业化的进程。
    亲爱的进忠同志：我所在的工厂——甘肃日报印刷厂，比起鞍钢来，当然是太小了。但随着鞍钢和全国建设的胜利进展，我们的印刷厂，我们的报纸，我们全体职工在各方面都起着很大的变化。我们原来用对开机印报，光印报就得七部机器、十四个人、七个小时才能印完当天的报；现在，我们已开始用我们国家自己制造的轮转机，给甘肃人民印报了；目前我们只用五个人，在两小时内就把当天的报印完了。最近我们又买来两部机器，全是我们国家自己的钢铁，由我们工人阶级自己亲手制造的，我们的职工同志看着它，有的就说：“看到我们的机器，就想起我们的鞍钢。我们有了鞍钢，祖国将来的工业化，就有了保证！”
    现在，我们印报的新机器开始印报了，原来印报的对开机就可以为人民印刷更多的书刊了；在其他业务方面也扩大了。第四季度，我们的计划任务是二十六亿，增产节约九亿，共三十五亿，现在我们正想尽一切办法，完成我们的这个计划，来支援建设鞍钢的同志们。
    另外，我们这里已建立了新工房、新宿舍，我们的职工人数比解放初增加了四倍，我们每个人建设祖国的本领提高了。但是我们知道：这仅仅是开始，只有让我们的鞍钢加速成长，让祖国加速工业化起来，我们的政治、经济和文化生活才能达到普遍的高涨。请你来信告诉我们，你和同志们是怎样建设我们的钢都的？
                甘肃省工业劳动模范  蒲廷珍
