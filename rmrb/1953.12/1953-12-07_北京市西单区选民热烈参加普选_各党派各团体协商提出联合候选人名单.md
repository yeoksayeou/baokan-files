    Xinhua News Agency, December 6th: The Xidan District of Beijing, which was the first to launch grassroots elections, has seen over 142,000 voters actively and enthusiastically participate in the general election movement. Since early October, each electoral district has successively completed voter registration and other work, and now representatives candidates have been formally nominated.
    Xidan District has more than 228,000 residents, many of whom are staff members of central, North China, and Beijing municipal organs. The entire district is divided into 27 electoral districts, including Zhongnanhai electoral district, where the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government are located. The voters here love the grassroots regime, and they are now deliberating on electing delegates to the Xidan District People's Congress in accordance with the provisions of the Electoral Law.
    Before the start of the general election in Xidan District, a pilot project was conducted in the jurisdiction of the Anfu Hutong police station. Now, voters throughout the district are participating in the general election movement with even greater enthusiasm. Reporters have given general election work reports to 70% of the voters in the district. Many literary and art enthusiasts, including workers, students, and housewives, have actively participated in general election propaganda activities. They use cross-talk, clapper talk, Shandong Allegro, short plays, and other forms to promote the general election to voters. Zhao Dehai, a 78-year-old man from outside Fuchengmen, has experienced the long-term reactionary rule of the Manchus, the Republic of China, and Chiang Kai-shek. He keenly feels the value of the people's democratic rights. He said, "This is a major event for the people themselves, and I will participate in the propaganda well." This gray-haired old man promoted the general election using his skilled Taiping Lyrics tune, leaving a deep impression on the people. Workers in various factories celebrated the general election with practical actions in production. Wu Baokui, a worker in the type-casting workshop of the Beijing No. 2 Printing Factory, was separated from his wife for many years due to poverty in the old society, and was reunited only after liberation, with his life gradually improving. Today, he deeply realizes that only the people's regime can bring happiness to the people. In the general election movement, under the leadership of Wu Baokui, the entire workshop put forward the slogan of creating more wealth for the country to welcome the general election. The workshop overfulfilled its October plan by 274%.
    Staff members of state organs and people's organizations are deeply aware that the people's congress system of general election will further consolidate the state power and better guarantee the implementation of the general line and general tasks of the country during the transition period. They all actively participated in the election activities. Some larger organs have established general election work groups or election offices under the leadership of the district election committee, using big-character posters, blackboards, and other methods to promote the general election to voters within the organs and organize the study of the Electoral Law and related documents. The Supreme People's Court of the Central People's Government, the Political and Legal Committee of the Government Administration Council, and the Ministry of Justice of the Central People's Government jointly held a cadre meeting, at which the heads of the organs made reports on the general election work. Voters from units such as the Beijing People's Court, Beijing Transportation Company, and Waterworks Company also promoted the significance of the general election to residents in the streets near the organs, which was warmly welcomed by the residents. In addition to giving reports on the general election to the staff of their own organs, the heads of various organs personally participated in the general election activities. Peng Zemin, Deputy Director of the Political and Legal Committee of the Government Administration Council, conscientiously participated in the discussion of the voter list at the voter group meeting. During the population investigation and registration, the directors of the General Affairs Bureau and the Commodity Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce of the Central People's Government personally reported the situation of their family members to the election office. On the day of issuing voter certificates, the Ministry of Commerce of the Central People's Government held a general meeting of all staff members, at which many people spoke. Everyone was very concerned about the election of grassroots regimes, and unanimously expressed that they would conscientiously fulfill the obligations of voters and elect satisfactory and necessary people to manage state affairs in a responsible manner.
    After conducting a strict and serious review of voter qualifications, the vast number of voters in Xidan District began to deliberate on candidates for representatives. In order to propose more suitable candidates, voters conducted extensive visits, and many outstanding workers and state organ staff members were nominated as candidates for representatives by the voters. On the basis of voter deliberation and visits, the various parties and groups in Xidan District conducted consultations and proposed a joint list of candidates. Now, the voters' discussion of the joint candidate list has ended, and each electoral district has announced the official list of candidates to the voters. In addition to workers and state organ staff members, the official list of candidates also includes representatives from all walks of life and strata, such as youth, women, cultural and educational workers, the industrial and commercial sector, ethnic minorities, and religious circles.

    北京市西单区选民热烈参加普选
    各党派各团体协商提出联合候选人名单
    【新华社六日讯】北京市首先展开基层选举的西单区，十四万二千多选民积极热情地参加了普选运动。从十月上旬开始，各选区先后完成了选民登记等工作，现在已正式提出代表候选人。
    西单区有二十二万八千多居民，其中有很多是中央、华北与北京市的机关工作人员。全区划为二十七个选区，中国共产党中央和中央人民政府所在地中南海选区也包括在内；这里的选民们热爱基层政权，他们正按照选举法的规定，酝酿选举参加西单区人民代表大会的代表。
    西单区普选开始前，曾在安福胡同派出所辖区进行了试办工作。现在全区选民正以更大的热情投入到普选运动中来。报告员曾经向全区百分之七十的选民作了普选工作报告。很多文艺爱好者，其中有工人、学生和家庭妇女，积极参加了普选宣传活动，他们用相声、快板、山东快书、小型话剧等形式，向选民说唱普选。阜城门外七十八岁的老人赵德海，历经满清、民国和蒋介石的长期反动统治，他亲切地感到人民民主权利的可贵，他说：“这是人民自己的大事情，我要好好参加宣传”。这位白发苍苍的老人，用他熟练的太平歌词调子宣传普选，在人民中留下了深刻的印象。各工厂的工人以生产上的实际行动来庆贺普选。北京印刷二厂铸字车间工人吴保奎，在旧社会因生活穷困和妻子离散多年，解放后才得到团聚，生活并日益改善。今天他深刻地体会到只有人民的政权才有人民的幸福。在普选运动中，全车间工人在吴保奎的带领下，提出了为国家创造更多财富来迎接普选的口号，这个车间十月份超额百分之二百七十四完成了计划。
    国家机关和人民团体的工作人员们，他们深知普选的人民代表大会制度，将使国家政权更加巩固，使国家在过渡时期的总路线、总任务得到更好地贯彻和有力的保证，他们都积极地参加了选举活动。一些较大的机关，都在区选举委员会领导下成立了普选工作组或选举办公室，用大字报、黑板报等方式，向机关内部的选民宣传普选，组织对选举法及有关文件的学习。中央人民政府最高人民法院、政务院政治法律委员会、中央人民政府司法部三个机关，曾联合举行了干部大会，由机关负责人作了关于普选工作的报告。北京市人民法院、北京市运输公司、自来水公司等单位的选民，并向机关附近的街道居民宣传普选的意义，受到居民热烈欢迎。各机关的负责人除向本机关的工作人员作普选的报告以外，都亲自参加普选活动。政务院政治法律委员会副主任彭泽民，在选民小组会上认真地参加选民名单的讨论。中央商业部机关事务管理局和商品局的局长等在人口调查登记时，都亲自到选举办公室报告自己家庭人口的情况。发选民证的那天，中央人民政府商业部举行了全体工作人员大会，会上有许多人讲话，大家对基层政权的选举都十分关怀，一致表示要认真履行选民的义务，切实负责地选出满意和必要的人来管理国家大事。
    西单区的广大选民对选民资格进行了严格认真的审查后，就开始了酝酿代表候选人的工作。为提出更适合的候选人，选民们进行了广泛的访问活动，很多优秀的工人和国家机关工作人员被选民提名为代表候选人。在选民酝酿与访问的基础上，西单区各党派各团体进行协商，提出了联合候选人名单。现在选民讨论联合候选人名单已经结束，各选区都向选民公布了正式候选人名单。在正式候选人名单中，除工人与国家机关的工作人员以外，还有青年、妇女、文化教育工作者、工商界、少数民族、宗教界等各界各阶层的代表人物。
