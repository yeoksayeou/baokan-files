Comrades,

Today is the day when the people of Beijing are holding a rally in response to the call of the Third World Trade Union Congress to support the struggle of the Vietnamese people. At this very moment, in our neighbor Vietnam, the French colonialists, who have already become vassals of US imperialism, are brutally slaughtering our peace-loving Vietnamese brothers and sisters with planes, cannons, tanks, machine guns, and bayonets. At this very moment, the heroic Vietnamese people, for the independence and freedom of their motherland, for the sake of human justice, and for the peace of Asia and the world, are waging a heroic and unyielding struggle against the French imperialists. The working class and people of all Asian countries, in order to oppose imperialist aggression and defend the peace of Asia and the world, are placing boundless sympathy and support in the Vietnamese people. The French working class and righteous people are also waging a serious struggle against the French government to oppose this dirty war of aggression against Vietnam. The flames of opposing aggression, defending peace, and striving for the relaxation of the international situation have ignited everywhere among the working class and peace-loving people of the world, and they have joined hands closely with the Vietnamese people to form an irresistible force.

The peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has always sincerely sympathized with and cared for the just struggle of the Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese people are the brothers of the Chinese people, our close neighbors who are connected by flesh and blood, and our comrades-in-arms in defending the peace of Asia and the world. Their struggle is especially one that the Chinese people have always sympathized with and cared for. Their struggle is not only for the national interests of the Vietnamese people themselves, but also for the interests of peace that the Chinese people, the Asian people, and the people of the world all desire. Therefore, the touching date of December 19th is not only the Vietnamese people's National Resistance Day, but also the "International Day of Active Support for the Vietnamese People and the Struggle to Stop the Colonial War in Vietnam" for all the people of the world.

For nearly a hundred years, French imperialists have invaded Vietnam, plunging the Vietnamese nation, which has a long history and culture, into an abyss of suffering. By 1940, the decadent French imperialists in the East succumbed to Japanese militarism, and in the West surrendered to German fascism. Vietnam was then sold to Japanese militarism by the French imperialists, and the Vietnamese people suffered the barbaric slaughter and plunder of Japanese imperialism. The Vietnamese people are a brave and industrious nation, and they have waged a long and unyielding struggle to resist the dark rule of French imperialism. After Vietnam fell under the rule of Japanese imperialism, the heroic Vietnamese people, under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, united to wage a sacred struggle against the Japanese aggressors. On August 19, 1945, the Vietnamese people rose up across the country and liberated their motherland from the rule of Japanese militarism. On September 2, President Ho Chi Minh issued the Declaration of Independence of Vietnam, announcing the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The current war in Vietnam was imposed on the Vietnamese people by the French aggressors. After gaining the liberation of their motherland, the peace-loving Vietnamese people, for the sake of their country's independence and the peace of Asia, also conducted peaceful negotiations with France and signed a "Provisional Agreement." However, the French aggressors, who returned for a comeback, dared to break faith and tear up this agreement in order to continue enslaving the Vietnamese people, and launched a full-scale war of aggression against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on this day seven years ago. This fact proves that the imperialists are the ferocious enemies of all freedom-loving nations.

In order to conquer the Vietnamese people, the French aggressors adopted the most brutal means. They bombed the peaceful cities and villages of Vietnam, and massacred the peaceful people of Vietnam. They implemented a policy of destruction, engaging in rape, robbery, arson, and murder everywhere. This is the so-called Western civilization that carries the banner of "liberty, equality, and fraternity."

We know that the present era is the era of the people, and the people do not allow imperialism to run rampant. Due to being subjected to French aggression, the Vietnamese people were forced to take up arms to oppose aggression and defend the independence and freedom of their nation. They have proven with their heroic struggle, unyielding great spirit, and continuous great victories that a nation that has awakened, loves freedom, and dares to fight for the independence of its motherland is invincible. Over the past seven years, the Vietnamese people have united around the Vietnam Workers' Party and President Ho Chi Minh, united under the banner of fighting for the independence and freedom of their motherland, advancing wave upon wave, fighting bravely, liberating most of the country, eliminating more than 320,000 enemy troops, and making their own strength grow stronger day by day. Their heroic struggle has been praised by all progressive humanity. Like the Korean people, they have set a shining example for the liberation struggles of oppressed nations in Asia and the world. Like the Korean people, they have made great contributions to the just cause of the world's people in defending peace and opposing aggression. They are not isolated. All freedom-loving and peace-loving people in the world stand with them, because their war is patriotic, just, and progressive.

Conversely, the French imperialists' dirty war of aggression against Vietnam is unpopular. This war has not only brought war to the Vietnamese people, but also caused disaster to the French people. It is precisely because of this that the righteous people throughout France, led by the working class, oppose this dirty war. They are struggling to stop this war. This has created an increasingly serious political crisis for the French government. President Ho Chi Minh's interview with a Swedish reporter on November 26, advocating the cessation of the war in Vietnam and the peaceful settlement of the Vietnam issue through consultation on the basis of respecting the independence of the Vietnamese people, has been welcomed by the broad masses of the French people, which is not accidental.

What deserves serious vigilance from all the righteous people of the world is the conspiracy of US imperialism. US imperialism has consistently supported the French imperialists' war of aggression against Vietnam. As is well known, most of the weapons and military supplies used by the French imperialists to slaughter the Vietnamese people are supplied by the United States. US imperialism and French imperialism have an agreement to jointly "defend" Indochina. US imperialism has its own representatives in the French invading forces. The purpose of US imperialism is to use the blood of French youths sold cheaply by the French government to establish and expand a base for waging wars of aggression in Southeast Asia. Now, after the cessation of the Korean War, in order to continue creating international tensions and continue implementing its policy of arms expansion and war preparations, US imperialism is more blatantly interfering in the Vietnam War. On the one hand, it is instigating the French colonialists to continue and expand the Vietnam War, and on the other hand, it is taking advantage of France's difficulties to force France to become more dependent on the United States, so as to replace France's position in Vietnam and vainly attempt to turn Vietnam from a French colony into an American colony. This seriously threatens the peace of the Far East and the world. It is precisely this serious situation that cannot but arouse the serious vigilance of the Chinese people, the Asian people, and all peace-loving people in the world.

The peace-loving people of the world have always advocated the use of peaceful consultation to resolve existing international disputes. The Vietnam War is the largest war existing after the Korean Armistice. This war seriously threatens the peace of Asia and the world due to the continued conduct of French imperialism and the intensified interference of US imperialism. It is precisely because of this that the peace-loving people of the world not only fully sympathize with and support the Vietnamese people's struggle for independence and freedom, but also advocate ending this bloodshed through peaceful consultation, realizing a ceasefire in Vietnam, and peacefully resolving the Vietnam issue. This peaceful aspiration of the peace-loving people of Vietnam has thus been widely and warmly welcomed by them.

We want to warn the French and American imperialists: Do not vainly attempt to conquer the heroic Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese people cannot be defeated, and all freedom-loving nations cannot be defeated. The Korean people were not defeated despite being attacked by the most powerful war machine, and the Vietnamese people will never be defeated by even greater attacks than they face now. The Vietnamese people are bound to carry out their patriotic struggle to the final victory, and the peace-loving people of the world are bound to always sympathize with and support this struggle of the Vietnamese people. We believe that in today's world where the forces of peace are so strong, it is certainly possible to achieve a ceasefire in Vietnam and resolve the Vietnam issue through negotiation on the basis of respecting Vietnamese national independence. Justice and peace are bound to defeat tyranny and force.

Long live the independence and freedom of the Vietnamese people!
Long live the close unity of the Chinese and Vietnamese people!
Long live world peace!

### 中华全国总工会副主席  刘宁一在大会上的讲话

    中华全国总工会副主席
    刘宁一在大会上的讲话同志们：
    今天是北京市人民响应世界工会第三次代表大会的号召而举行的支援越南人民斗争日的大会。正在这个时候，在我们的邻邦越南，那已经沦为美帝国主义附庸的法国殖民主义者，正在使用着飞机、大炮、坦克、机关枪和刺刀野蛮地残杀着越南的爱好和平的兄弟姊妹们。也正在这个时候，英勇的越南人民，为了他们祖国的独立、自由，为了人类的正义，为了亚洲和世界的和平，正在和法帝国主义者进行着英勇不屈的斗争。亚洲各国的工人阶级和各国人民，为了反对帝国主义侵略，保卫亚洲与世界的和平，对于越南人民寄予着无限的同情和支持。法国的工人阶级和正义的人民，也正在为了反对这个侵略越南的肮脏战争，向着法国政府进行着严重的斗争。全世界的工人阶级和爱好和平的人民，到处燃起了反对侵略、保卫和平与争取缓和国际局势的烈火，他们和越南人民紧密地携起手来，形成了一个不可抗拒的力量。
    以苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营，对于越南人民的正义斗争，历来是衷心地同情和关怀的。越南人民是我们中国人民的兄弟，是我们血肉相连的近邻，是我们保卫亚洲与世界和平的战友，他们的斗争尤其是我们中国人民所历来同情和关怀的。他们的斗争，不但是为了越南人民自己的民族利益，也是为了中国人民、亚洲人民和世界人民所一致要求的和平的利益。所以，十二月十九日这个可歌可泣的日子，不但是越南人民的全国抗战日，同时也是全世界人民“国际积极支援越南人民日与争取停止越南殖民战争斗争日”。
    近百年来，法帝国主义者侵略了越南，把一个具有悠久文化的越南民族陷入了痛苦的深渊。到了一九四○年，腐朽的法帝国主义者在东方屈服于日本军国主义，在西方投降了德国法西斯主义，越南从此又由法帝国主义者出卖给了日本军国主义，越南人民又遭到了日本帝国主义野蛮的屠杀和掠夺。越南人民是勇敢的勤劳的民族，他们为着反抗法帝国主义的黑暗统治，曾进行长期的不屈不挠的斗争。在越南沦入日本帝国主义统治之后，英勇的越南人民，又在胡志明主席领导下，团结了起来，对日本侵略者进行了神圣的斗争。一九四五年八月十九日，越南人民全国奋起，从日本军国主义统治下解放了自己的祖国，九月二日胡志明主席发表了越南独立宣言，宣布了越南民主共和国的成立。
    目前的越南战争是法国侵略者强加于越南人民身上的。爱好和平的越南人民在获得祖国解放之后，为了自己祖国独立和亚洲和平的利益，也曾和法国进行了和平谈判，签定了“临时协定”。但是，卷土重来的法国侵略者，为了继续奴役越南人民，竟敢背信弃义，撕毁这一协定，在七年前的今天，发动了对越南民主共和国的全面侵略战争。这一事实证明了：帝国主义者是一切爱好自由的民族的凶恶的敌人。
    法国侵略者为了征服越南人民，它们采取了最残暴的手段。他们轰炸了越南的和平城市与村庄，屠杀了越南的和平人民。他们实行毁灭政策，到处奸淫、抢掠和烧杀。这就是打着“自由、平等、博爱”旗帜的所谓西方文明。
    我们知道，现在的时代是人民的时代，人民是不容许帝国主义横行霸道的。由于受到法国的侵略，越南人民被迫拿起武器来反对侵略，保卫自己民族的独立和自由。他们用自己的英勇斗争、不屈不挠的伟大精神和不断取得的伟大胜利证明着：一个觉悟了的爱好自由的敢为祖国独立而奋起战斗的民族，是不可战胜的。七年来，越南人民团结在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的周围，团结在为自己祖国的独立、自由而斗争的旗帜下，前仆后继，奋勇作战，解放了全国大部分土地，消灭了敌军三十二万多人，并使自己的力量一天比一天壮大起来。他们的英勇斗争受到全体进步人类的赞扬。他们和朝鲜人民一样，为亚洲和全世界被压迫民族的解放斗争树立了光辉的榜样。他们也和朝鲜人民一样，为世界人民保卫和平、反对侵略的正义事业作出了伟大的贡献。他们不是孤立的，全世界爱好自由与和平的人民都和他们站在一起，因为他们的战争是爱国的、正义的、进步的。
    反之，法帝国主义者进行这场侵略越南的肮脏战争是不得人心的。这场战争不但给越南人民带来了战祸，也给法国人民造成了灾难。正是因为这样，法国全国以工人阶级为首的正义人民都反对这一肮脏战争。他们正在为停止这一战争而进行着斗争。这就造成法国政府越来越严重的政治危机。十一月二十六日胡志明主席和瑞典记者的谈话，主张在尊重越南人民独立的基础上，经过协商，停止越南战争，和平解决越南问题，获得了法国广大人民的欢迎，这不是偶然的。
    最值得全世界正义人民严重警惕的是美帝国主义的阴谋。美帝国主义是一贯支持法帝国主义侵略越南的战争的。如所周知，法帝国主义用来屠杀越南人民的武器和军用品，大部分都是美国供应的。美帝国主义和法帝国主义订有共同“防守”印度支那的协定。美帝国主义在法国侵略部队里派有自己的代表。美帝国主义的目的，是想用法国政府廉价卖出的法国青年的血，来为它在东南亚建立和扩大进行侵略战争的基地。现在，在朝鲜战争停止之后，美帝国主义为了继续制造国际紧张局势，继续实行扩军备战政策，正在更加露骨地干涉越南战争，它一方面唆使法国殖民主义者继续和扩大越南战争，另一方面又利用法国的困难，迫使法国更加依附美国，以便取法国在越南的地位而代之，妄想把越南从法国的殖民地变为美国的殖民地。这就更加严重地威胁着远东与世界的和平。正是这种严重局势，不能不引起中国人民、亚洲人民和全世界爱好和平人民的严重警惕。
      全世界爱好和平的人民，一向主张用和平协商的办法解决现存的国际争端。越南战争是在朝鲜停战后现存的最大的战争。这个战争由于法帝国主义的继续进行和美帝国主义的加强干涉而严重威胁着亚洲与世界的和平。正是因为这样，全世界爱好和平的人民，不但充分同情和支持越南人民的争取独立自由的斗争，而且主张经过和平协商来结束这一场流血，实现越南停战，和平解决越南问题。越南爱好和平人民这一和平愿望，因而受到他们广泛的热烈的欢迎。
      我们要警告法国和美国帝国主义者：休要妄想征服英勇的越南人民，越南人民是打不败的，一切爱好自由的民族都是打不败的。朝鲜人民没有因为受到最强大的战争机器的袭击而被打败，越南人民也决不会因为受到比现在更大规模的袭击而被打败。越南人民是一定要把自己的爱国斗争进行到最后胜利的，全世界爱好和平的人民也是一定要永远同情和支持越南人民这一斗争的。我们相信，在和平力量如此强大的今天，在尊重越南民族独立的基础上，以协商方法，获得越南停战和解决越南问题是一定能够实现的。正义与和平是一定能够战胜暴虐和武力的。
    越南人民的独立自由万岁！
    中越两国人民的亲密团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
