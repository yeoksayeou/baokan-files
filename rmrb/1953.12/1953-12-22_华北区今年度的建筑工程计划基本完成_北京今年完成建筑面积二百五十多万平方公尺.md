Xinhua News Agency, December 21st: The construction project plan for the North China region in 1953 has been basically completed. According to incomplete statistics from Shanxi, Hebei, and Suiyuan provinces, as well as Beijing and Tianjin municipalities, over 5 million square meters of construction projects have been completed to date. Factory buildings account for a large proportion of these construction projects. Major projects include the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant, the Yuci Jingwei Textile Machinery Manufacturing Plant, the Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, the Shijiazhuang No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, the Central Bureau of Weights and Measures Factory, and other building materials, printing and dyeing, pharmaceutical, and farm tool factories. The civil engineering plans for these factories have mostly been completed; some have even started the installation of machinery and equipment, striving to put them into production in the first or second quarter of next year. In addition, schools, hospitals, dormitories, and offices have been expanded or newly built in various parts of North China.

This year's basic construction tasks in the North China region were very heavy. Moreover, due to late designs, late starts, and the low level of management and technical skills in construction enterprises, most construction sites failed to meet their progress plans in the first half of the year. Later, thanks to the strong leadership of the local Communist Party committees and people's governments, especially after the launch of the increased production and conservation campaign and the publicity and study of the Party's general line for the transition period, construction workers and management cadres in construction enterprises in various regions have demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity, successively established responsibility systems, and promoted many advanced experiences, which greatly accelerated the progress of the projects.

Through this year's basic construction work, the North China region has initially formed a state-owned construction force. According to statistics from the North China Construction Engineering Bureau, compared to 1952, the number of construction workers increased by 47%, technical cadres increased by 65%, and management cadres increased by 96% in 1953. Through the anti-waste campaign, the establishment of responsibility systems, the launch of the increased production and conservation campaign, the strengthening of scheduling work and planned management, and the promotion of parallel flow operation methods, instruction charts, and the advanced experiences of five types of projects—bricklaying, carpentry, steel reinforcement, plastering, and concrete—the management level of construction enterprises and the technical level of construction workers and technicians have all been improved, preparing technical conditions for larger-scale construction in the future.

Xinhua News Agency, December 21st: Beijing's various construction projects for 1953 have been basically completed. There are more than 400 construction sites in the city this year, and new construction projects include factories, schools, theaters, hospitals, dormitories, and offices. The total construction area completed this year is more than 2.5 million square meters, which is equivalent to about one-fifth of the total area of existing houses in Beijing before liberation. To meet the needs of various constructions and urban life, more than 80 kilometers of new sewers and more than 110 kilometers of new water pipes have been built this year. In the urban and suburban areas, 200 kilometers of roads have been restored, rebuilt, and newly built, and five new tram and bus lines have been opened, making transportation in the capital more convenient. Key projects have now entered the winter construction season, and other construction workers will soon begin winter training.

The expansion project of the Fengtai Bridge Factory of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government has been basically completed. When the factory was liberated, most of its production was done in the open air and manually. This year, the original steel beam workshop has been expanded into four workshops according to the flow operation: preparation, processing, riveting and assembling, and assembly, and many machines have been added. In this way, the factory's production capacity can be increased by more than one-third, and the products will support the construction projects of new railway lines across the country. The civil engineering part of the state-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory has been basically completed, and it can start production ahead of schedule next year. The Central Bureau of Weights and Measures Factory, affiliated with the Ministry of Light Industry of the Central People's Government, has also been completed. Next year, this factory will begin to produce precision balances, steel rulers, steel tape measures, automatic scales, and other weights and measures and verification devices to meet the needs of all aspects of construction, and will prepare conditions for the unification of the weights and measures system in our country. In addition, metal structure factories and building materials factories for wood, brick, stone, glazed tiles, etc., have been built and will be able to supply the needs of basic construction in North China and the capital next year.

In order to implement the policy of correspondingly cultivating national construction talents, Beijing has expanded and built more than 110 higher education institutions, secondary technical schools, cadre schools, and ordinary primary and secondary school buildings this year. In the Northwest Cultural and Educational Zone, more than ten new types of higher colleges have mostly completed this year's construction plan, and many professors and students have moved into new school buildings to work and attend classes. These include colleges of iron and steel, aviation, geology, petroleum, mining, railway, forestry, and agricultural mechanization. The entire project of these institutions will continue to be completed in the next few years.

Among the more than 30 newly built and expanded medical institutions, the Soviet Red Cross Hospital, Tuberculosis Hospital, Mental Hospital, Chronic Disease Sanatorium, Hui Muslim Hospital, and five outpatient clinics have been basically completed this year, and some have already begun treating patients.

Among the construction projects completed this year, there are also more than 1,000 peasant hostels that can accommodate more than 4,000 people. These peasant hostels are located in convenient places such as Chaoyangmen, Guang'anmen, and Yongdingmen, and are equipped with heated brick beds, luggage racks, canteens, barbershops, clubs, large car rooms, livestock troughs, etc., according to the habits of peasants. They have been welcomed by the broad masses of peasants after opening.

    华北区今年度的建筑工程计划基本完成
    北京今年完成建筑面积二百五十多万平方公尺
    【新华社二十一日讯】华北区一九五三年度的建筑工程计划已基本完成。据山西、河北、绥远三省和北京、天津二市不完全统计，到目前已完成了五百多万平方公尺的建筑工程，这些建筑工程中，工厂厂房占了很大的比重。其中主要的有太原重型机器厂、榆次经纬纺织机械制造厂、北京第一棉纺织厂、石家庄第一棉纺织厂、中央度量衡厂和其他建筑器材、印染、制药和农具厂等。这些厂的土木建筑计划大部分都已完成；有的并开始了机器设备的安装工作，争取在明年第一季度或第二季度投入生产。此外，华北各地还扩建或新建了一些学校、医院、宿舍和办公室。
    华北区今年的基本建设任务很重，而且由于设计迟、开工晚、建筑企业管理技术水平不高，上半年大部分工地没有按期完成进度计划。后来由于各地中共党委和人民政府的大力领导，特别是开展增产节约运动和宣传学习党在过渡时期的总路线以后，各地建筑工人和建筑企业管理干部，都发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，相继建立责任制度，并推广了很多先进经验，工程进度才大大加快。
    华北区经过今年的基本建设工作，已初步组成了一支国营的建筑队伍。据华北建筑工程局统计，一九五三年和一九五二年相比，建筑工人增加了百分之四十七，技术干部增加了百分之六十五，管理干部增加了百分之九十六。经过反浪费和建立责任制度，开展增产节约运动，加强调度工作和计划管理，推广平行流水作业法、指示图表和瓦、木、铁筋、抹灰、混凝土五种工程的先进经验，建筑企业的管理水平和建筑工人、技术人员的技术水平，都提高了一步，给今后更大规模的建设准备了技术条件。
    【新华社二十一日讯】北京一九五三年度的各项建设工程已经基本上完成。全市今年有四百多个建设工地，新建工程包括工厂、学校、影剧院、医院、宿舍和办公室等。今年完成的建筑面积共有二百五十多万平方公尺，约等于北京解放前原有房屋总面积的五分之一。配合各项建设和城市生活的需要，今年又新建了八十多公里长的下水道，一百一十多公里长的自来水管，在城区、郊区恢复、改建和新建了二百公里长的道路，新辟了五条电车和公共汽车线路，使首都的交通更加方便起来。现在重点工程开始进入冬季施工，其他建筑工人即将进行冬季训练。
    中央人民政府铁道部丰台桥梁工厂的扩建工程已基本完成。这个厂解放时大部分是露天、手工生产，今年把原来的钢梁车间，按流水作业扩建成准备、加工、铆合拼装、装配等四个车间，添置了许多机器。这样，全厂生产能力可以提高三分之一以上，产品将支援全国各铁路新线的建设工程。国营北京第一棉纺织厂，土木建筑部分已基本完成，明年可提前开工生产。中央人民政府轻工业部所属的中央度量衡工厂也已建设完成。这个工厂明年将开始生产精密的天平、钢片尺、钢卷尺、自动秤等度量衡器和检定器，以满足各方面建设的需要，并将为我国统一度量衡制准备条件。此外，金属结构工厂和木材、制砖、制石、琉璃瓦等建筑器材工厂都已建好，明年就可以供应华北区和首都基本建设的需要。
    为了贯彻相应地培养国家建设人材的方针，今年北京市扩建和新建了一百数十所高等院校、中等技术学校、干部学校和普通中小学校的校舍。在西北文教区，十多所新型的高等学院已大部分完成了今年的建筑计划，很多教授、学生都搬进新校舍工作和上课了。这里包括钢铁、航空、地质、石油、矿业、铁道、林业和农业机械化等学院。这些院校的全部工程将在今后几年内继续完成。
    在三十多所新建和扩建的医疗机关中，今年已经基本建成苏联红十字医院、结核病院、精神病院、慢性病疗养院、回民医院和五个门诊部，有的并已开始为病人治疗。
    在今年完成的建筑工程中，还有一千多间可容纳四千多人的农民旅馆。这些农民旅馆分布在朝阳门、广安门、永定门等交通方便的地方，并按照农民习惯设置有热炕、行李架、食堂、理发室、俱乐部、大车房、牲口槽等，营业后受到了广大农民的欢迎。
