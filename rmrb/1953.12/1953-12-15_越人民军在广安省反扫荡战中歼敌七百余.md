Xinhua News Agency, December 14th: According to the Vietnam News Agency on December 12th, the Vietnamese People's Army annihilated 715 enemy soldiers and captured a large quantity of weapons and ammunition during the anti-sweep operation in the Chi Linh area of Quảng Ngãi Province in North Vietnam on November 26th and 27th.

　　On November 26th, the enemy mobilized the 3rd Mobile Group and three battalions of the Foreign Legion to launch a large-scale "sweep operation" against the Chi Linh guerrilla zone in Quảng Ngãi Province. The People's Army's local forces and guerrillas gave the enemy a powerful counterattack from the very beginning. On November 26th, the enemy attacked a certain height three times, but were completely repelled by the People's Army. In the battle, two enemy companies were annihilated.

　　On the morning of November 27th, the People's Army launched a fierce attack on the enemy at Giang Ha, annihilating 140 enemy soldiers. On the same day, the enemy hastily dispatched 200 motorcycles full of reinforcements from Hai Duong Province, but they were intercepted by the People's Army, resulting in the loss of a platoon.

　　In other areas, the enemy also suffered fierce resistance from the local army and people, and suffered heavy losses. Therefore, the enemy had to dispatch many helicopters to transport the wounded during these two days.

　　Due to the heroic fighting of the army and people in the Chi Linh area, the French colonialists were forced to withdraw all their troops from the area on November 28th.

    越人民军在广安省反扫荡战中歼敌七百余
    【新华社十四日讯】据越南通讯社十二日讯：越南人民军十一月二十六日和二十七日两天在北越广安省芷灵地区的反扫荡战中，共歼敌七百一十五名，并缴获大量武器和弹药。
    十一月二十六日，敌人动员了第三机动团和外籍兵团三个营对广安省芷灵游击区发动了一次大规模的“扫荡战”。人民军地方部队和游击队从一开始就给敌人有力的反击。十一月二十六日，敌人三度进攻某高地，都被人民军完全击退。在战斗中，计歼灭敌军两个连。
     十一月二十七日早晨，人民军猛攻江诃的敌军，歼敌一百四十名。当天，敌人匆忙从海阳省派遣二百辆满载援军的摩托车前来增援，又遭到人民军的截击，损失了一个排。
    在其他地方，敌军也都遭到当地军民的猛烈抗击，损失也很大。因此，敌人不得不在这两天内派遣许多直升飞机来搬运伤兵。
    由于芷灵地区军民的英勇作战，法国殖民者被迫于十一月二十八日把他们的军队从这个地区全部撤退。
