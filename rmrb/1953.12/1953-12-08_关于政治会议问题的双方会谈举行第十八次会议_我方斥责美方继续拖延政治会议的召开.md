Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 7th. The delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China participating in the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference issued the following communique:
    On December 7th, the 18th meeting of the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference was held. The U.S. representative, Dean, did not attend today and was replaced by his advisor, Young. Due to the continued delays by the U.S. side, today's talks made no progress. Mr. Qi Xiufu, the representative of our side, spoke, accusing the U.S. representative of not being able to attend after a two-day suspension of the meeting, which prevented the meeting from proceeding normally. He then pointed out: It has been a full week since our side put forward comprehensive and reasonable proposals, and the other side has adopted various delaying tactics and has not seriously discussed our comprehensive proposals at all. In the past week, the other side has successively requested a two-day recess, wasted the time of one meeting, made absurd and ridiculous distortions of our comprehensive proposals, and then completely evaded our comprehensive proposals, instead making lengthy speeches on Article 37 of the Armistice Agreement and Article 11 of the "Terms of Reference", in order to distort the facts, provoke disputes, and delay time.
    Mr. Qi Xiufu finally questioned whether the other side was prepared to seriously discuss our comprehensive proposals in order to reach an agreement quickly.
    However, the U.S. representative continued to delay, still insisting on its unreasonable demands regarding the neutral country status of the Soviet Union, the authority of neutral countries to participate in the political conference, and the voting procedures of the political conference. Our side immediately pointed out that the other side, on the one hand, absurdly and unreasonably denies that the Soviet Union is a neutral country, and on the other hand, imposes various insulting restrictions on the authority of neutral countries in the political conference. This is clearly an attempt to completely deprive neutral countries of their status in the political conference and fundamentally eliminate the role of neutral countries in the political conference. The other side's insistence on various unreasonable demands that essentially reject the participation of neutral countries in the conference is entirely to delay the convening of the political conference, in order to further undermine the armistice agreement, forcibly detain prisoners of war, and realize the other side's conspiracy to maintain tension in the Far East. Our side further emphasized that for the sake of peace, the Soviet Union must participate in the political conference as a neutral country, and neutral countries must be able to express their opinions on the agenda items agreed upon by both sides without restriction at the conference. This is our firm and unwavering position. As for the voting procedures of the political conference, our side pointed out that our proposed method of each country on both sides participating in the vote is reasonable, while the other side's proposed method of each side voting as a unit is an attempt to monopolize the voting rights of other countries on that side through one country on that side. The experience of the armistice negotiations has proven that the other side's proposal for unit voting is irresponsible. For example, General Harrison, the chief representative of the other side in the armistice negotiations, agreed and signed the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" on behalf of all seventeen countries on the other side participating in the war of aggression against Korea as a unit, but only ten days later, the South Korean government, one of the members of the other side, openly violated the "Terms of Reference" and forcibly detained more than 27,000 of our captured personnel. If the other side is not attempting to allow one country on the other side to monopolize the voting rights of other countries on the other side, so that one member of the other side has the opportunity to violate the agreement again, then the other side has no reason to oppose our reasonable proposal on voting procedures.
    Finally, our side warned the other side again that if the other side insists on its own way, continues to delay the convening of the political conference, conspires to undermine the Korean armistice, and deliberately creates tension in the Far East, then the other side must bear all the consequences arising therefrom.

    关于政治会议问题的双方会谈举行第十八次会议
    我方斥责美方继续拖延政治会议的召开
    【新华社开城七日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国参加关于政治会议问题双方会谈的代表团发表公报如下：
    十二月七日，关于政治会议问题的双方会谈举行第十八次会议。美方代表迪安今日未出席，而由其顾问杨格代为出席。由于美方的继续拖延，今日会谈仍无进展。我方代表奇石福先生发言，斥责美方代表在会议停止两日后仍不能出席，致会议不能正常进行，继即指出：自从我方提出了全面的合理建议以来，到现在已经是整整的一星期，对方采取了种种的拖延手段，根本未对我方的全面建议进行认真的讨论。在过去的一星期中，对方先后要求了两天的休会，又浪费了一次会议的时间，对我方的全面建议进行了荒唐可笑的歪曲，其后则根本回避我方的全面建议，却对停战协定第三十七款和“职权范围”第十一款作了冗长的发言，以歪曲事实、引起争论来拖延时间。
    奇石福先生最后质问对方是否准备对我方的全面建议进行认真的讨论以求迅速达成协议。
    但美方代表仍一味拖延，对苏联的中立国地位、中立国参加政治会议的权限及政治会议的表决程序等问题，依然坚持其无理主张。我方当即指出：对方一方面荒谬无理地否认苏联为中立国，另一方面又对中立国在政治会议中的权限加以种种侮辱性的限制，这显然是企图完全剥夺中立国在政治会议中的地位，根本取消中立国在政治会议中的作用。对方坚持实质上拒绝中立国参加会议的种种无理主张，完全是为了拖延政治会议的召开，以便进一步破坏停战协定，强迫扣留战俘，实现对方保持远东紧张局势的阴谋。我方并强调指出：为了和平的利益，苏联必须以中立国身份参加政治会议，中立国必须在会议中不受限制地就双方协议的议程项目发表意见，这是我方坚定不移的主张。至于政治会议的表决程序，我方指出：我方所建议的双方的每一个国家一律参加表决的办法是合理的，而对方所主张的双方各作为一个单位投票的办法，是企图以一方的某一国家来垄断该方其他国家的表决权。停战谈判的经验已经证明，对方主张单位投票的办法是不负责任的。例如对方停战谈判首席代表哈利逊将军代表对方所有十七个参加侵略朝鲜战争的国家作为一个单位，同意并签订了“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”，但是仅仅十天之后，对方成员之一的南朝鲜政府就公然破坏了“职权范围”，强迫扣留了二万七千余名我方被俘人员。如果对方不是企图使对方的某一个国家来垄断对方其他国家的表决权，使对方的某一个成员又有破坏协议的机会，对方就没有任何理由反对我方在表决程序上的合理主张。
    最后我方又警告对方，如果对方一意孤行，继续拖延政治会议的召开，阴谋破坏朝鲜停战，蓄意制造远东紧张局势，则对方必须负担由此而产生的一切后果。
