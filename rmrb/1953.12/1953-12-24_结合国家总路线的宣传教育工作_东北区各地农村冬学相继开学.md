    Combining National General Line Propaganda and Education Work
    Winter Schools in Rural Areas of the Northeast Region Open One After Another
    Winter schools in rural areas of the Northeast Region are opening one after another, integrating with the propaganda and education work of the general line. This year, 1.2 million farmers in the region will enroll. After studying this winter, by next spring, more than 40% of the enrolled farmers will reach the standard of literacy, and the Northeast region will reduce the number of illiterate farmers by at least another 500,000. The majority of counties in Heilongjiang Province have already launched this work. According to incomplete statistics from 20 counties including Hailun County in the province, more than 58,000 students have resumed classes in existing classes, and more than 6,000 new students have started classes in 13 counties including Longjiang County. In Rehe Province, more than 128,000 farmers are participating in learning this year.
    The main teaching content of this year's winter school is to carry out political and ideological education on the general line and general tasks of the country during the transition period for farmers, and to carry out literacy learning. Rehe Province has determined that the specific approach for this year's winter school is to explain in detail the country's general line in the transition period and the policies on farmers selling surplus grain and mutual aid and cooperation. Through this education, farmers will improve their political awareness and actively participate in agricultural production. This year, more than 100,000 mass teachers and full-time teachers have been organized throughout the region, and many teachers have received training before the start of school. Changbei, Heishan, Kaiyuan, Xinmin and other counties in Liaoxi Province successively conducted education on the national general line for 210 trained volunteer teachers in November, enabling them to initially understand the country's guidelines and policies during the transition period, and also initially understand the relationship between the country's development prospects and the elimination of illiteracy. The propaganda departments of the Heilongjiang and Jilin Provincial Party Committees have also collected popular articles related to the country's general line during the transition period and compiled them into pamphlets as materials for propaganda to farmers.
    This year's winter school, in order to take into account the rural winter production and people's living conditions, has adopted a variety of forms in terms of learning methods and organization. In natural villages and agricultural production cooperatives where residence and production are relatively concentrated, concentrated forms are generally adopted. In areas where residence is relatively dispersed, learning groups are formed according to the participation of students in various rural sideline production activities, according to various sideline production groups such as fishing, hunting, and weaving. In terms of learning methods, the quick literacy method is only used in places with a foundation, and general teaching methods are adopted in other places.

    结合国家总路线的宣传教育工作
    东北区各地农村冬学相继开学
    东北区各地农村冬学正结合总路线的宣传教育工作相继开学。全区今年将有一百二十万农民入学。经过今冬学习，到明年春天，入学农民将有百分之四十以上达到扫除文盲标准，东北区最低又可减少五十万农民文盲。黑龙江省绝大部分县份已展开了这一工作。据该省海伦等二十个县不完全统计，已恢复了旧有班级的学员达五万八千多人，在龙江县等十三个县并有新发展的学员六千多人已开始上课。热河省今年参加学习的农民有十二万八千多人。
    今年冬学的教学内容主要是向农民进行国家在过渡时期总路线总任务的政治思想教育和开展识字学习。热河省确定今年冬学具体做法是：详细讲解我国在过渡时期的总路线和关于农民出售余粮以及互助合作的政策。通过这些教育，使农民提高政治觉悟，积极参加农业生产。今年全区组织起来的群众教师和专职教师达十万多人，很多教师在开学前都受到了训练。辽西省昌北、黑山、开原、新民等县在十一月先后对二百一十名受训练的义务教师进行了国家总路线的教育，使他们初步明确了国家在过渡时期的方针政策，也初步知道了国家发展前途和扫除文盲工作的关系。黑龙江、吉林两省党委宣传部门并收集了有关国家过渡时期总路线的通俗文章，编印了小册子，作为向农民宣传的资料。
    今年冬学为了照顾农村冬季生产和人民生活条件，在学习方法上和组织上采取了多种多样的形式。在居住和生产比较集中的自然屯、农业生产合作社一般都采取了集中的形式。在居住比较分散的地区，根据学员参加农村各种副业生产活动情况，按照捕鱼、打猎、编织等各种副业小组组成了学习小组。在学习方法上，只在有基础的地方采用速成识字法，其他地方都采取了一般的教学方法。
