    To strengthen the guidance and promotion of mass amateur art work and to promote the Spring Festival art activities in 1954, and to widely publicize the general line of the state during the transition period through amateur art activities, the Cultural Bureau of the North China Administrative Committee held a regional mass amateur art work conference from November 26 to 28. Representatives from the cultural departments of Beijing and Tianjin municipalities and Hebei, Shanxi, and Suiyuan provinces attended the meeting.
    The meeting first pointed out that with the restoration and development of production in the North China region in recent years, the needs of the broad masses for art have increased. To adapt to this situation, mass amateur art activities have been widely launched in various places. Hebei Province has more than 100 forms of mass amateur art activities, and Shanxi Province also has nearly 100 forms. In factories and mines, activities such as drama, dance, singing, folk art, and fine arts are regularly carried out. Currently, more than one million workers in the region participate in amateur art activities. In rural areas, Yangko dance, large drum performances, small flower operas, and fast clapper talks are popular. In recent years, most villages have established mass amateur troupes. According to recent statistics, there are more than 12,000 rural amateur troupes in Hebei Province and 10,000 in Shanxi Province. The mass art activities in various places generally implement the spirit of serving production, closely cooperate with the central work of the local area, and widely publicize the achievements of the country's economic construction over the past four years, the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement, and the idea of the worker-peasant alliance through small and diverse art forms that are popular with the masses. After the two national opera and folk music and dance festivals, the leading departments in various places have paid more attention to folk art and have gradually strengthened the leadership of mass amateur art activities.
    The meeting determined that the main task of mass amateur art activities in the region next year is to carry out publicity and education on the state's general line through various art forms; and required that mass art activities be consolidated on the existing basis in a prepared, planned, and focused manner, to further clarify the principles of amateurism and mass participation, and to overcome the chaotic phenomena in some areas where mass amateur art activities involve performing large-scale operas, developing towards professionalization, and affecting mass production, so that mass amateur art activities can better adapt to economic construction and the needs of the people.
    The Spring Festival is the most active period for mass amateur art activities, and it is also the time for summarizing the year's production and formulating next year's production plans. The meeting discussed and studied the need to use the Spring Festival mass amateur art activities in 1954 to vigorously publicize the state's general line for the transition period to the broad masses. The meeting decided that the period from now until the Spring Festival should be the preparation stage, and required all provinces and cities to formulate Spring Festival art activity plans and complete the supply of art propaganda materials as soon as possible. The meeting also required the cultural administrative departments and cultural centers in various places to dispatch some cadres to factories and villages before and after the Spring Festival to assist in mass Spring Festival art activities; and to organize some professional art workers, teachers and students of provincial and municipal mass art schools to go to factories and villages to provide key guidance to mass Spring Festival art activities. The meeting decided to take the period from the first day to about the twentieth day of the first lunar month as the period for widely launching mass art activities, and required that through the publicity work of the Spring Festival art activities, the general line should be deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, forming a driving force for continuing to carry out the patriotic campaign to increase production and practice economy and the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement, and doing a good job in the general election and spring ploughing.

    华北区决定利用明年春节群众业余文艺活动
    向广大群众深入宣传过渡时期总路线
    为加强对群众业余文艺工作的指导和推动一九五四年春节文艺活动，并通过业余文艺活动广泛地宣传国家过渡时期总路线，华北行政委员会文化局在十一月二十六日到二十八日召开了全区性的群众业余文艺工作会议。到会的有北京、天津两市和河北、山西、绥远三省人民政府文化部门的代表。
    会议首先指出：华北区近几年来随着生产的恢复和发展，广大群众对文艺的需要更加提高。为适应这样情况，各地群众性的业余文艺活动已经比较普遍展开，河北省有一百多种群众业余文艺活动的形式，山西省也有近一百种，在厂矿里能经常展开活动的，有戏剧、舞蹈、歌唱、曲艺和美术等形式。现在，全区参加业余文艺活动的工人就有一百万人以上。在农村中流行着秧歌、大鼓、小花戏、快板等。近几年来大部村庄建立了群众业余剧团，据最近的统计：河北省有农村业余剧团一万二千多个，山西省也有一万个。各地群众性的文艺活动，一般都贯彻了为生产服务的精神，紧密配合当地中心工作，通过群众喜闻乐见的小型多样的文艺形式，广泛地宣传了国家四年来的经济建设成就、农业互助合作运动和工农联盟的思想。全国戏曲和民间音乐舞蹈两次会演后，各地领导部门对民间艺术更加重视，也逐渐加强了对群众业余文艺活动的领导。
    会议确定：明年全区群众业余文艺活动，主要是通过各方面各种文艺形式进行关于国家总路线的宣传教育；并要求对群众文艺活动在现有基础上有准备、有计划、有重点地加以整顿，进一步明确业余性、群众性的方针，克服部分地区群众业余文艺活动的演大戏、向职业化发展、影响群众生产等混乱现象，使群众业余文艺活动更好地适应经济建设和人民的需要。
    春节是广大群众业余文艺活动最活跃时期，也是一年生产总结和制订下一年生产计划的时候。会议讨论研究了要利用一九五四年的春节群众业余文艺活动，向广大群众大张旗鼓地宣传国家过渡时期总路线。会议决定从现在到春节前夕为准备阶段，要求各省、市都定出春节文艺活动计划，及早完成文艺宣传材料的供应工作。会议并要求各地文化行政部门和文化馆，都在春节前后抽调部分干部下厂下乡协助群众春节文艺活动；并组织部分专业文艺工作者、省市群众艺术学校师生下厂下乡对群众春节文艺活动进行重点辅导。会议决定以农历正月初一到二十日左右为广泛展开群众文艺活动时期，要求通过春节文艺活动的宣传工作，使总路线深入人心，形成继续开展爱国增产节约和农村互助合作运动、做好普选、春耕等工作的推动力。  （新华社）
