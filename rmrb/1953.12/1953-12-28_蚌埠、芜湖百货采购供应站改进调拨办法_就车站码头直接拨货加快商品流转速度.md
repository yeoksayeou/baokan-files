    Bengbu and Wuhu Department Store Procurement and Supply Stations Improve Allocation Methods
    Direct Allocation of Goods at Stations and Docks to Accelerate Commodity Turnover
    The Bengbu and Wuhu Procurement and Supply Stations of the Anhui Provincial Company of the China Department Store Corporation have adopted the method of direct allocation at stations and docks, reducing commodity warehousing procedures, reducing transportation costs, and accelerating capital turnover.
    The Bengbu Department Store Procurement and Supply Station generally uses land transportation for incoming and outgoing goods. In the past, the method of goods entering the warehouse first and then being allocated took at least eight days. In terms of cost, taking a truckload of sugar (30 tons) as an example, calculated based on eight days of storage, it required warehouse rent, unloading fees from the station to the warehouse, shunting fees, transportation fees from the warehouse to the station when leaving the warehouse, plus railway unloading and loading fees, totaling 1,641,600 yuan. After adopting the on-site allocation method, the time required is only two to three days. In terms of cost, taking a truckload of sugar as an example, applying for vehicles to use the station platform for storage for three days costs about 70,000 yuan, plus unloading and loading fees of 200,000 yuan, for a total cost of 270,000 yuan. Compared with the method of entering the warehouse first and then allocating, the on-site allocation method can save about 60% of the transportation time and more than 80% of the cost per truckload of sugar.
    The Wuhu Department Store Procurement and Supply Station generally uses shipping for incoming and outgoing goods. If the method of entering the warehouse first and then allocating is adopted, it takes eight to eleven days. Taking one ton of second-class goods (including daily necessities, sugar, hardware and electrical materials, knitwear, etc.) as an example, it requires unloading fees, handling fees (fees from the cargo ship to the pontoon), labor costs (costs of transporting goods from the pontoon to the dock warehouse), handling fees from the dock to the warehouse, handling fees from the warehouse to the dock when leaving the warehouse, handling fees, loading fees, and warehouse rent, totaling 85,816 yuan. If direct allocation at the dock is adopted, it generally takes only four to five days, and the cost includes unloading, handling, labor costs, and when allocating, handling, loading, and warehouse rent, totaling 45,103 yuan. The on-site allocation method can save about half of the transportation time and cost per ton of second-class goods.
    The problems that need to be solved with this allocation method are: 1. The requisition plans of grassroots units often do not match the commodity supply of procurement and supply stations at all levels, and the incorrect plans of grassroots units further create difficulties in the allocation of first and second-level procurement and supply stations. Therefore, grassroots units must gradually improve their requisition plans so that second-level procurement and supply stations can achieve on-site allocation at stations and docks. 2. The method of allocating goods at the station or dock is suitable for whole-piece commodities, but not suitable for unpacking and selling in small quantities. However, a large proportion of packaging at first-level procurement and supply stations is too large to meet the requirements of grassroots units. Therefore, first-level stations should pay attention to reducing packaging to meet the requirements of grassroots units and expand the scope of directly allocated goods.

    蚌埠、芜湖百货采购供应站改进调拨办法
    就车站码头直接拨货加快商品流转速度
    中国百货公司安徽省公司蚌埠、芜湖采购供应站采用就车站和就码头直拨的办法，减少商品的出入库手续，减少了运输费用，加速了资金周转。
    蚌埠百货采购供应站一般进出货都是陆运。过去实行货物先进仓再调出的办法，最快也得八天。在费用上，如以一车糖（三十吨）为例，按堆放八天计算，就需要仓租、由车站到仓库的卸车费、调车费、出库时由库到车站的运费，再加上铁路卸车、装车费等费用一百六十四万一千六百元。采用就站拨付办法后，在时间上只需二至三天，在费用上，仍以一车糖为例，因申请车辆利用车站站台堆放三天计，约七万元，加上卸车装车费二十万元，共需费用二十七万元。就站拨付和先进仓再调出的办法比较，每车糖约可节省调运时间百分之六十，费用百分之八十以上。
    芜湖百货采购供应站一般进出货都是航运，如采取先进仓再调出的办法，在时间上需八至十一天，如以一吨二等商品（包括日用百货、糖、五金电料、针棉织品等）为例，需要出舱费、过侢费（从货船运至趸船的费用）、上河力资（从趸船运货至码头仓库的费用）、由码头到仓库的搬运费，出库时由仓库到码头的搬运费、过侢费、装舱费、仓租共计八万五千八百一十六元。如采用码头直拨，一般只需四至五天，在费用上需出舱、过侢、上河力资，调出时需过侢、装舱、仓租等费用共四万五千一百零三元。每吨二等商品约可节省调运时间和费用约一半左右。
    这种调拨办法需要解决的问题是：一、基层单位要货计划常常和各级百货采购供应站的商品供应不相适应，再加上基层单位计划不正确，形成一、二级采购供应站调拨上的困难，因此要逐步使基层单位改进要货计划，才能使二级采购供应站做到就站、就码头拨付的办法。二、采用就车站或码头调拨的办法适于整件商品，不适于拆包零付。但目前一级采购供应站很大一部分包装偏大，不能适合基层单位的要求。因此，一级站应注意缩小包装，以适应基层单位的要求，扩大直拨商品的范围。
