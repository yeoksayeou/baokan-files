Comrades, our meeting is being held at a time of great significance. Now, everyone, whether in the cities or the countryside, feels and understands that our country is entering a new stage in its advance towards communism, a stage in which the entire process of socialist construction has been fully prepared.

The most important and pressing task of the Communist Party and the Soviet state has always been and will always be to continuously and steadily raise the living standards of the people, and to satisfy their material and cultural needs as fully as possible at each stage.

Since the October Revolution, our country has traversed a difficult path. The legacy we inherited was heavy: an underdeveloped and backward industry, a backward agriculture, and a very low consumption level for the vast majority of the people. However, our country has rapidly developed its economy, and the speed of this development has been unprecedented in any country at any stage of its development.

Moreover, it is impossible not to take into account the fact that during the thirty-five years of the establishment of the Soviet power in our country, about fifteen years were spent in wartime and in the years of recovery of the national economy after the imperialist war, the civil war, and the Great Patriotic War.

From 1924-1925, when the economy recovered to the level of 1913, to 1953, in this nearly thirty-year period, industrial output increased by twenty-nine times, of which more than seventy percent was production of means of production. In the last twelve years alone, from 1940 to 1952, Soviet industrial output increased by 2.3 times, despite the fact that during this period the Great Patriotic War occurred, which seriously affected our national economy.

Now, not only our foreign friends, but also many who cannot be considered friends, have begun to observe the facts more clearly. They no longer remain silent about our economic achievements and acknowledge the feasibility of our plans, although they use information about our peaceful construction achievements to try to intimidate people for their own purposes of aggression.

For example, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, Walter W. H. Johnson, said in a speech at the University of Illinois in July this year: "The Soviet Union has achieved remarkable success in the economic field since the end of the war.... Indeed, this is a very rapid rate of development.... If this rate of development continues, then by around 1960, the economic power of the Soviet Union will likely equal and even surpass the economic power of Western Europe. This is not a particularly happy situation; it is a factor that we should always keep in mind."

In contrast to the threats of these figures, ordinary people around the world do not fear our achievements because they see that all our efforts are directed towards one goal—to make the country abundant in food, abundant in industrial goods, and to build a communist society.

It should be said that the industrialization of the country, the rapid development of heavy industry, is the material foundation of socialism. The realization of these goals, in the final analysis, is to create conditions for our people's material well-being to rise rapidly and unprecedentedly in history. But in a certain period, we had to impose certain restrictions on consumption to solve the primary tasks of economic construction. This is because we did not have such enormous possibilities as we have now.

Now, we can develop heavy industry at a high speed while more rapidly developing the production of consumer goods.

Regarding these and other urgent issues, Comrade Malenkov spoke in his report to the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Malenkov's report is a programmatic statement of the Soviet government, which sets out our future economic tasks. It notes that to ensure a significant increase in the production of consumer goods, it is first necessary to further develop and improve the supply of food to the population and the supply of raw materials to light industry and the food industry.

According to published materials, everyone knows that in early September, the Central Committee of the Party held a plenary meeting, listened to Comrade Khrushchev's report on measures to further develop Soviet agriculture, and made a resolution on this issue. This resolution is of historical significance for the development of our country.

In the report and the resolution of the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU, a true and unvarnished assessment was made of the current situation of our agriculture, especially livestock farming. They show that the achievements of livestock farming and agriculture so far cannot satisfy us, and the extremely rich potential of the collective farm system has not been fully utilized.

The measures adopted in agriculture by the Plenary Session are not temporary measures but fundamental measures. This is precisely the basic link in the economic policy of our Party. Mastering this link will enable us to achieve and will certainly achieve a rapid new upsurge in our entire economy, greatly improve the living standards of workers, collective farmers, and the entire people, and further strengthen the alliance between socialist cities and collective farms, which is a strong bulwark against capitalism and a powerful base for advancing to the victory of communism.

Everyone knows that the Plenary Session paid special attention to the current state of livestock farming and measures for its further development, because it is of great importance for expanding the production of valuable food—meat and meat products, dairy products, and fats, and for the supply to the population.

The problem of increasing the production of potatoes and vegetables is also urgent. The demand for potatoes and vegetables has increased to the extent that the current level of production is completely unable to meet this demand. Therefore, the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Party approved measures to improve this situation, raised the procurement prices, reduced the obligatory delivery quotas to the state, and increased the share of potatoes and vegetables purchased at fixed prices.

The Plenary Session set the task of completing the full mechanization of all agricultural work and the mechanization of livestock farming.

The resolution of the September Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee opens up broad prospects for us to significantly improve the material well-being of the people. This resolution can eliminate some major shortcomings in the leadership of agriculture, it can eliminate the imbalance in the level and speed of development of certain sectors of the national economy, especially the lag of livestock farming and vegetable cultivation behind the national economy and the needs of the people, which Comrade Khrushchev explained very clearly in his report. This direction of development is in accordance with the law of proportional development of the socialist economy.

Thus, this series of measures, on the one hand, creates the conditions for expanding the production of consumer goods, and on the other hand, also creates the conditions for further raising the purchasing power of the people.

This is one of the fundamental advantages of our economy over the capitalist economy. Many capitalist countries could have increased the production of goods and even had the capacity to increase the production of goods, but they had to reduce production, sometimes even stop production, close factories, because the exploitation of the working people was increasing day by day, and they were becoming poorer day by day, and thus had less money to buy things.

In contrast, in our country, the increase in demand promotes production, the development of production determines the increase in consumption, creates demand, and makes it possible to reduce prices, increase the income of cities and villages, and thus improve the purchasing power of the working people.

In our socialist country, labor products are entirely for the satisfaction of social needs or the individual needs of society's members. Therefore, the vigorous increase in the production of consumer goods for the population is also a sharp improvement in the material well-being of the working people.

Under the conditions of a significant increase in production and consumption, we still cannot eliminate the imbalance between the production of consumer goods and the growing demand of the Soviet people. The rapid increase in the production of consumer goods in our country is precisely to eliminate this imbalance.

The following facts can illustrate how great our possibilities are now to improve the well-being of the people. Comrade Malenkov said in his speech at the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet that from April to December 1953, the trade departments will receive 32 billion rubles more goods than the 312 billion rubles originally planned for this period to supply to the population. Two and a half months later, the Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Central Committee of the CPSU managed to allocate an additional 5.2 billion rubles of goods for sale to the population. Thus, the trade departments will receive an additional 37.2 billion rubles of goods to supply to the population. It can be seen that the rapid increase in production has already begun this year.

Bolsheviks are men of action. In the past few months, the government has taken a series of important measures to try to significantly and rapidly improve the well-being of the people this year, first of all, to improve their purchasing power.

First, the retail prices of consumer goods in state and cooperative trade this year have been reduced by a total of 46 billion rubles, while last year they were reduced by 24 billion rubles. This means that the purchasing power of the population has increased by 22 billion rubles just from this source.

Second, the amount of state bonds purchased this year is 16 billion rubles less than last year.

Third, the reduction of the agricultural tax and the increase in procurement prices, as well as other measures for agriculture, will enable rural residents to obtain more than 13 billion rubles in additional income this year.

Therefore, just from the measures listed above, the purchasing power of the population has increased by hundreds of billions of rubles this year. The material well-being of the Soviet working people is growing at an unprecedented speed.

The turnover of commodities in the USSR (calculated at comparable prices) has increased nearly eightfold in twenty-seven years (from 1926 to 1953), while the physical volume of commodities per capita has increased by 10.3% per year, which is three times the rate of the tsarist era, despite the fact that there were four years of the Great Patriotic War in these twenty-seven years. In the tsarist era, the turnover of commodities increased threefold in twenty-seven years (from 1885 to 1912), and the physical volume of commodities per capita increased by 3.5% per year.

In this year alone, the increase in the turnover of retail commodities (calculated at comparable prices) has exceeded the total turnover of retail commodities in 1913 in the tsarist era.

For the first time in human history, the task of raising the food consumption level of the people to meet scientific nutritional standards, that is, the standards of nutrition needed for the full and harmonious development of a healthy person in a socialist society, has been set on a nationwide and national scale. A lot of work has been done in this regard this year.

In 1953 alone, the amount of food sold to Soviet residents increased by 22% compared to 1952. The amount of meat and meat products sold to residents by the state this year increased by 42.4%, and animal fats increased by 44.8%.

In 1953, the amount of animal fats sold to residents through state and cooperative trade organizations was approximately 2.6 times that of the pre-war year 1940, which is not without significance.

As can be seen, the increase in supply is enormous, but the demand of the people is increasing even faster, so in many places, there is still a shortage of meat, sausages, animal fats, and fish.

To ensure the rapid increase in production and further rapid improvement in the material well-being of the people, the Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Central Committee of the CPSU have adopted plans to expand food production and improve its quality and variety.

In 1955, food production will increase by 84.7% compared to 1950, while the increase rate specified in the directives of the Nineteenth Party Congress on the five-year plan was 71.4%. This means that the task of food production in the five-year plan will be significantly overfulfilled. At the same time, the production task for the first year of the next five-year plan, 1956, has been increased.

This is our country's great three-year plan to increase food production! Below are some of the most important figures for the increase in food production.

In 1955, the state industry in our country will produce more than 250 million tons of meat, and in 1956, 300 million tons; sausages in 1955 will be 85 million tons, and in 1956, 100 million tons.

In 1955, the catch of fish will be around 32 million poods, and in 1956, 36 million poods. Just the catch of herring in 1956 will be nearly 8 million poods. Currently, many people complain that there is a shortage of fish and fish products, saying that fish has become less, while before it seemed to be more. This is not entirely correct, or more precisely, it is simply incorrect. Fish has increased, but our needs have increased faster than the catch of fish. In 1913, the catch of fish in the tsarist era was 12/7 less than now. Indeed, the great plan for fishing has not yet been completed, but it has increased significantly compared to before the war.

State industry will produce 560,000 tons of butter in 1955 and 650,000 tons in 1956. In 1913, the total industrial output of animal fats in tsarist Russia was 104,000 tons, half of which was exported abroad.

The production of animal fats in the USSR is now increasing by approximately the total amount of fat production in 1913 each year. However, it should be noted that the demand of the population for animal fats is increasing, and there is a shift from lower-value fats to higher-value fats. Therefore, in addition to increasing production, we have recently also imported a certain amount of these fats from abroad.

Currently, the production of sugar is approximately three times that of pre-revolutionary Russia, and in 1956, it will be four times. Now, the production of pastries is 20 times that of 1913. In the next few years, the production of chocolate and chocolate products will increase significantly, with the output in 1956 being 12 times that of 1940, and biscuits will increase by 3.5 times.

In the next three years, the production of other foods will also increase significantly. This is the plan to make our country abundant in food, which is one of the prerequisites for building a communist society.

The Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Central Committee of the CPSU believe that it is necessary to vigorously develop light industry in the next two to three years and have adopted a plan to expand the production of consumer goods and improve their quality.

Therefore, new tasks are set before industry: to significantly advance the completion of the five-year plan's production tasks for consumer goods by 1955 and to ensure the rapid growth of production in 1956, thus providing the basis for the rapid increase in the production of consumer goods in the next five-year plan.

In the next three years, the production of consumer goods in our country will increase by approximately 50%, and now an increase of 1% represents a much larger absolute amount than before.

Not only the enterprises of the Ministry of Light Industry will expand the production of goods needed by the population, but almost all ministries, such as aviation, defense, metallurgy, and machine-building industries, will also undertake the heavy task of additional production of consumer goods. This is an important feature of the resolution that was passed.

This will make it possible to solve the problem of the rapid increase in the production of industrial goods more quickly and significantly improve the quality of industrial goods.

For example: in 1955, the following will be produced: bicycles—3,445,000 units, of which the Ministry of Machine-Building Industry—2,700,000 units, the Ministry of Defense Industry—500,000 units; radios and televisions—4,527,000 units, of which the Ministry of Power Stations and Electromechanical Industry—3,800,000 units; electric refrigerators—330,000 units, of which the Ministry of Defense Industry—110,000 units, the Ministry of Aviation Industry—90,000 units, the Ministry of Machine-Building Industry—60,000 units; aluminum molded tableware—64,000 tons, of which the Ministry of Aviation Industry—35,000 tons; metal beds—16,500,000 units, of which the Ministry of Aviation Industry—4,200,000 units, the Ministry of Metallurgy—3,900,000 units, the Ministry of Transport and Heavy Machine-Building—1,000,000 units, the Ministry of Defense Industry—600,000 units.

In 1956, the production of consumer goods will be further increased. For example: in 1956, 3,800,000 bicycles will be produced, which is 14 times that of 1940, 23,000,000 watches, approximately 9 times that of 1940, 5,400,000 radios and televisions (of which 1,000,000 are televisions), while in 1940, 200,000 radios were produced, and televisions were not produced at all.

The following facts can prove how great our possibilities are now to develop the production of consumer goods. In 1953, the aluminum allocated for the production of consumer goods was much more than the total production of the country in 1937. This shows that we are now very rich, and therefore we can allocate these quantities of precious raw materials that we could not allocate before to produce consumer goods.

At the same time, measures were also adopted to improve the quality of many other consumer goods and expand their varieties.

The Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Central Committee of the CPSU also approved measures to further improve the work of the railway transport system in transporting consumer goods.

Now, railway transport should serve the work of transporting consumer goods better, pay attention to the needs of the market, and consider the improvement of trade, rather than just the convenience of railway workers. In the future, the method of classifying goods into categories A and B should be abolished, according to which some goods supplied to the population are often listed as category B. The authority of the station masters has also been expanded, thereby also expanding the authority and possibilities of local trade organizations in planning the transportation of consumer goods.

Accelerated freight trains should be used on the main railway lines. To ensure that food and industrial goods can be sent out from intermediate stations in a timely manner, the regular operation of mixed trains and mixed vehicles has been established on many sections.

The extensive construction of warehouses, station freight yards, and loading platforms will be of great help to trade.

This resolution also imposes a heavy responsibility on trade workers. The phenomenon of vehicles stopping due to the negligence of trade organizations is intolerable. The obligations undertaken to the transportation department must be executed accurately and on time.

The role and tasks of Soviet trade in the current stage

Without significantly improving the efficiency of Soviet trade, the rapid increase in the level of consumption will not be realized. Soviet trade is the basic method of distributing consumer goods in our socialist society.

As Comrade Malenkov said in his speech at the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet, trade under the socialist system is now and will remain for a long time the main form of satisfying the growing individual needs of the working people. The mission of Soviet trade is, according to the requirements of the laws of the socialist economy, to continuously deliver the products of socialist industry and agriculture to the population.

In our country, the law of planned and proportional development of the national economy is at work, which requires the conscious and organized coordination of production and consumption. Since our economy is planned, we can calculate the demand directly without detours and develop production based on the demand. The greatest advantage of our system lies here. This also gives rise to the heavy responsibility of the trade organizations, because the success of the work depends entirely on ourselves, on our organization and ability.

There are still serious shortcomings in the trade organizations that hinder the further development of trade and the improvement of services to the population. Trade organizations are not good at studying the needs of the population, and serious mistakes occur in the distribution and transportation of goods.

The task of trade workers is to study the needs of the population and actively influence production, while advocating for the interests of consumers to produce consumer goods according to the needs of the population. If trade organizations do not influence industry and do not defend the interests of buyers, then they are no longer considering the basic principles of Soviet trade.

Trade should not be passive towards the needs of the population. The mission of Soviet trade is to actively influence demand in a progressive spirit. It should cultivate the tastes of consumers, introduce new goods to the population, promote the most nutritious and health-promoting foods, and promote industrial goods that are practical, of good quality, beautiful, and can make the daily and cultural life of the working people more perfect.

Now, due to the new and powerful increase in the production of consumer goods, the role of Soviet trade has become even greater. Trade organizations should accurately and flexibly sell the rapidly growing large quantities of goods, not allowing any congestion in the sale of goods, so that in the next two to three years, all necessary goods can be purchased in every city and agricultural region.

Soviet trade plays a huge role in further developing the economic ties between socialist industry and collective farms, in further strengthening the alliance between the working class and the peasants, and in improving the production of collective farms. The obligation of trade organizations is to thoroughly implement Lenin's instructions: "The state must learn to trade, so that industry can satisfy the peasants, and the peasants can satisfy their needs through trade." (Lenin, Collected Works, Russian edition, Volume 33, page 50)

The great Lenin's call to "learn to trade" is still valid in the current situation. When we transitioned to the New Economic Policy, we had no trading experience and no trading cadres of our own. We started from the most basic knowledge of trade and learned to trade in the competition and struggle with private traders.

Now, under the conditions of the victory of socialism, Soviet trade has entered a new, higher stage of development; it has accumulated rich experience, established and trained a million-strong army of Soviet trade workers. The resources of goods have increased significantly. Now, trade is no longer the trade of the past, and trade workers are no longer the trade workers of the past. However, it must be frankly admitted that trade is lagging behind the rapidly growing demands of the people.

We should cultivate the cultural level of young trade workers, arm them with knowledge, and improve their skills. It is necessary to raise the level of all trade workers to meet the requirements of the current tasks of Soviet trade, cultivate their sensitivity, and carefully treat the demands of consumers, and serve customers with a courteous attitude.

Soviet trade is a socialist method of distribution. The trade of a socialist society is, for the first time in history, trade that serves the people. To implement the grand program of building a communist society in our country, we must, with the greatest determination, develop Soviet trade, fully utilize all its potential, and create the conditions for the implementation of the principles of communist distribution in the future.

Our thirty-plus years of experience in economic construction fully and clearly demonstrates the great superiority of Soviet trade over capitalist trade. The fundamental superiority of our socialist trade lies in the fact that its purpose is to serve people and their needs, to satisfy the needs of Soviet people as fully as possible. In complete contrast, the motive of capitalist trade is to pursue the maximum profit, and the consumer is merely the object of the most unscrupulous plunder by capitalists and speculators.

In bourgeois countries, the stagnation and cyclical decline of trade are the result of the increasing impoverishment of the broad masses of residents.

From 1928 to 1940, the turnover of commodities in the USSR increased by 2.3 times (calculated at comparable prices). In the same period, the turnover of commodities in capitalist countries did not increase but even fell below the level of 1929 on the eve of the Second World War.

In the post-war years, the contrast between the two lines of development was equally clear—the rapid increase in our trade and the stagnation of trade in capitalist countries. In 1952, the turnover of commodities in the United States remained at the level of 1950, while in Britain it even decreased. The USSR's turnover of retail commodities (calculated at comparable prices) increased by two times from 1949 to 1952.

Some people in the United States and Britain still boast about the abundance of consumer goods in their markets. However, in bourgeois countries, while there are many goods in the stores, the people have no money to buy them, so what good is that to them! Today, their situation is worse than in 1929, not to mention the "golden age" of Western European residents before the First World War. Now, the law of development in capitalist countries is such that they are inexorably on a downward slope, moving towards a lower level of consumer goods production.

We are another law. In the years of the Soviet regime, we have advanced very far. Our production, commodity turnover, and consumption are developing in a planned manner, and their speed of development has never been seen even in the best periods of bourgeois countries. Indeed, when we were still a backward and poor country, these countries had already reached a relatively high level of development, but for decades they have stagnated and even regressed, so can they boast about that? Only by comparing our development trends with theirs can we correctly evaluate achievements. There is no doubt that since we have successfully solved the task of developing heavy industry, we can also rapidly develop the production of consumer goods and in this regard, we will also become the richest country, ensuring the highest living standards for the people. Moreover, unlike the capitalist economic system where national wealth does not belong to the people, we strive to ensure the highest level of consumption for the entire population and always consider improving the composition of consumer goods based on scientific requirements in the development of production.

Only in a socialist society can there be a rationally organized trade, whose turnover costs are low and truly cares about the interests of consumers. With the development of Soviet trade, the turnover costs, that is, the costs of goods from production to the hands of consumers, are also constantly decreasing. The Soviet government has shown unremitting concern to reduce these costs to the lowest possible level. Reducing the cost of industrial goods and the turnover costs in trade is the main source of constantly reducing prices. According to the USSR's five-year plan for the development of the national economy from 1951 to 1955, we should reduce the turnover costs of trade by 23%. In further reducing the turnover costs, we have great possibilities, the methods of which are:

First, constantly explore and make full use of internal economic potential, practice economy, and constantly improve the service to consumers;

Second, eliminate losses, the quality of goods must not be reduced, there must be no damage, eliminate unreasonable transportation, and ensure the uninterrupted delivery of goods to trade organizations, vigorously expand the sales of packaged goods and piece goods; equip stores with modern trade equipment and internal transportation tools;

Third, reduce the costs of the trade process, more rationally organize the supply of goods, eliminate redundant links, and reduce the costs of trade management organizations.

One of the greatest advantages of our state and cooperative trade is that it is conducted at fixed prices, which are constantly being reduced. Our consistent reduction of prices is an unshakable principle of the policy of the Soviet government, the purpose of which is to increase the purchasing power of the people and give every member of Soviet society the opportunity to further improve their material well-being.

We even reduce the prices of goods that are still not abundant in quantity if these goods are of great importance to the majority of consumers. It should be noted that this will lead to an increase in demand and will promote us to more rapidly increase the production of goods that are lacking and necessary for residents.

Since 1947, our country has reduced prices six times, thereby reducing the overall price level by more than half, and the purchasing power of the Soviet ruble has increased to more than twice. The residents have benefited a lot.

In contrast, the trade of capitalist countries, whose prices are free, capitalists and speculators do not miss any opportunity to raise prices, enriching themselves at the expense of the hunger and poverty of the working people. After the war, in all capitalist countries, prices soared speculatively, thereby further lowering the consumption and living standards of the working people.

Since 1947, the USSR has reduced the prices of bread, meat, and fats by two-thirds, while in France, the prices of these items have doubled, in Britain, the price of bread has increased by approximately two times, meat by 1.5 times, and fats by 2.5 times. In the United States, the prices of these items have also increased, although slightly less.

In our Soviet trade, there is no smell of merchants. Trade workers should strictly adhere to the prescribed prices, and any violation of these prices is considered a crime. Soviet law strictly protects the interests of consumers.

In this regard, the State Trade Inspection plays a huge role. The State Trade Inspection is the plenipotentiary representative of the state conducting supervision, and it should resolutely fight against attempts to violate the prescribed prices, resolutely fight against deceptive behavior towards customers, and take measures to prevent such violations.

The public supervision of the trade unions also has important significance. When the working masses also participate in supervision, such supervision becomes a great social force. The responsibility of the leaders of trade organizations is to make full use of this supervision to improve trade operations, assist and promote the work of inspectors.

The comprehensive inspection of the quality of goods sold to residents is one of the manifestations of the Soviet government's unremitting concern for the well-being and health of the people.

During the years of the Soviet regime, a complete system of state inspection of commodity quality has been established, and the quality is inspected in special laboratories according to scientific methods, and sanitary inspections are organized for industrial enterprises, trade organizations, and public catering enterprises. The activities of institutions such as the Food Quality Inspection Bureau and the Consumer Goods Quality Inspection Bureau are of primary importance in the inspection work. These inspection bureaus were previously subordinate to various industrial ministries, but now they have been transferred to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Trade, which is a new great help to trade and makes it easier to carry out the struggle to improve the quality of consumer goods.

We strive to make both expensive and inexpensive goods of excellent quality without exception. The old merchant's standard of "expensive is good, cheap is bad" is not our standard.

In capitalist trade, under the law of "no deception, no sale," counterfeit and counterfeit goods are widely sold. If selling spoiled and harmful goods can bring profits to capitalists, then they do not care about people's health.

The Soviet state has established a new type of trade that meets the needs of a socialist society, free from the vices and poisons of capitalist trade.

We have standard trading enterprises: food stores, department stores, and specialty stores that are envied by other countries. Now the task is to raise all our trade organizations to the level of the above-mentioned stores.

It should be noted that even under competitive conditions, in the face of increasing sales difficulties, bourgeois countries also set some not bad examples in the organization of trading enterprises, in trade technology, and in serving customers, especially wealthy customers.

Some comrades, under the pretext of opposing the worship of foreigners, ignore foreign experience, do not pay attention to foreign experience, do not study it, and do not use the things that are useful to us. These comrades cannot but be reprimanded.

On the one hand, we widely promote the advanced experience of our good trading enterprises, and on the other hand, we also learn from the better enterprises of bourgeois countries, use the things that are useful to us in their trade and customer service work, do not despise the use of this beneficial experience, and apply this experience for the benefit of the broad masses.

Our task is to resolutely expose and eliminate the shortcomings that exist in our trade, strive to improve trade work according to the requirements of the Soviet government and the Communist Party, and raise trade work to the level of socialist society laborers.

The growth of commodity turnover

The great achievements of our socialist construction, the growth of industrial goods and agricultural products, and the continuous improvement of the people's purchasing power also guarantee the growth of the turnover of retail commodities in our country.

In 1953, the turnover of retail commodities in state trade and cooperative trade increased by 79% compared to 1940 (calculated at comparable prices). In the past three years, the turnover of commodities has increased by an average of 13% per year (calculated at comparable prices), and in 1953, it increased by 20% compared to 1952.

The structure of commodity turnover is greatly improving. Before the war, in 1940, industrial goods accounted for 36.9% of the domestic commodity turnover, while in 1953, they accounted for 45.3%.

At the same time, we must talk about the implementation of the commodity turnover plan for this year. In the first quarter, there was a significant lag in the completion of the plan, only 94.9% was completed. The commodity turnover plan for the second and third quarters of this year, although it is said to have been completed, has not yet fully made up for the uncompleted amount in the first quarter, and has not completed the additional task of commodity turnover.

Up to now, we still have some states and republics whose trade organizations have not well completed the plan. For example, the trade organizations of Sverdlovsk City (the head of the City Trade Bureau is Comrade Bubnov) completed only 96.5% of the commodity turnover plan in the first nine months of 1953; the trade organizations of Chelyabinsk Oblast (the head of the Oblast Trade Bureau is Comrade Uskinov) completed 97.1%; the trade organizations of Voroshilovgrad Oblast (the head of the Oblast Trade Bureau is Comrade Volkov) completed 96.9%. The measures taken by the government in the second and third quarters of 1953 to increase the total amount of goods in the market, and the further increase in the cash income of residents, have already created all the conditions for overfulfilling the 1953 commodity turnover plan.

Now, the task of trade workers is to overfulfill the commodity turnover plan for the fourth quarter of 1953, thereby overfulfilling the annual plan, and to ensure the completion of the additional task of commodity turnover.

Now, let's briefly talk about the situation of importing consumer goods. In recent years, we have begun to use this supplementary source to supply residents. We are now richer, so we can import rice, citrus fruits, bananas, pineapples, herring, and other foods, as well as high-quality woolen goods, silk goods, furniture, and other industrial goods, and some other novel goods. These goods are well-received among residents.

This year, we have purchased a total of 4 billion rubles of consumer goods from abroad, of which two-thirds of the amount is imported from people's democratic countries. We also export some consumer goods that we have in large quantities and use some goods to aid people's democratic countries.

To ensure the rapid increase in Soviet trade, the Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the CPSU recently adopted the extremely important resolution on measures to further develop Soviet trade, which is our program of action for the next three years; such a rapid increase in Soviet trade has never been seen before.

The Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Central Committee of our Party believe that in 1954, it is necessary to increase the turnover of retail commodities in state and cooperative trade by 72% compared to 1950 (calculated at comparable prices), while the five-year plan stipulates an increase of 70% for 1955, which means that the task stipulated for 1955 in the five-year plan has been completed ahead of schedule in 1954. The turnover of retail commodities in 1955 will be approximately twice that of 1950.

Some people ask what is meant by the rapid increase in trade? Such growth in the turnover of commodities means the rapid increase in trade.

In 1955, the amount of food and industrial goods sold to residents will be significantly increased compared to the tasks stipulated in the five-year plan, which can be proven by the following materials:

The total amount of goods in the market in 1955 compared to 1950 increased as follows:
              Five-Year Plan Task  New Task
Meat products  1.9 times          2.3 times
Fish products  1.7 times          2.1 times
Animal fats    1.7 times          1.9 times
Vegetable oils 2.0 times          2.6 times
Sugar          2.0 times          2.3 times
Clothing       1.8 times          2.4 times
Textiles       1.7 times          1.8 times
              Of which woolen and silk goods  2.4 times
Furniture      3.0 times          4.0 times
Metalware     2.5 times          4.9 times
Sewing machines 2.4 times          5.1 times
Bicycles       3.5 times          5.5 times
Radios and televisions  2.0 times          4.4 times
Watches        2.2 times          2.6 times
Many other goods also have increased in total market quantity.

The Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Central Committee of the CPSU believe that in 1956, the total market quantity of major food and industrial goods must be significantly increased compared to 1950, with various goods increasing as follows:

Meat products 2.6 times
Fish products 2.3 times
Animal fats 2.1 times
Vegetable oils 2.8 times
Sugar 2.4 times
Textiles and shoes 2.0 times
Sewing machines 5.9 times
Bicycles 6.0 times
Radios and televisions 5.3 times
Furniture 4.8 times

In this resolution, major issues in improving the trade of food and industrial goods are solved, major issues in studying the needs of residents for goods are solved, and a plan to greatly increase the material and technical base of trade and other important measures for developing Soviet trade are outlined.

Now, the task of trade is to seriously promote the development of the Soviet trade cause and, in the next two to three years, ensure the uninterrupted supply of all necessary goods to residents in every city and agricultural region.

The characteristics of food trade are that the sales volume of extremely precious foods has increased significantly.

In the first half of 1953, the consumption of meat in Moscow increased to twice that of the first half of 1950, in Leningrad to 1.9 times, in Molotov to 2.2 times, in Sverdlovsk to 1.9 times, and in Chelyabinsk to 2.5 times. In other cities, the increase is less, but it is still very significant.

In 1953, the sales volume of animal fats will be 108,000 tons more than in 1952. In 1953, the sales volume of sugar will be 600,000 tons more than in 1952.

The textile workers of Ivanovo (Serebryakov Textile Factory) consumed 12.8 kilograms of sugar per person in 1909, while the Soviet textile workers consumed an average of 31.2 kilograms nationwide in 1952, and this figure will exceed 35 kilograms in 1953. It can be seen that the consumption of sugar has increased by more than two times.

It should be said that our sugar is still not sufficient in all regions, and often there are complaints: there is lump sugar but no granulated sugar, or there is granulated sugar but no lump sugar.

This is the result of the negligence and carelessness of the organizational work of industrial and trade operators.

The consumption of wine has also increased rapidly, and compared to 1940, the current consumption is 1.8 times. This is due to the significant improvement in the purchasing power of residents. Champagne is now no longer a luxury item but a commodity enjoyed by our workers, which also indicates general prosperity.

Meeting the demand of Soviet consumers for high-quality food should be the standard for industry and trade.

Soviet trade workers should, based on the needs of customers, put forward requirements to industry to expand the variety of food and improve its quality, thereby influencing industry.

The food industry still does not produce enough of some foods that residents like, such as: small sausages, meat patties, dumplings, sausages, and semi-finished meat products; such as: improved packaging candies: "Transparent Candies," "Shrimp," "Goose Feet," "Swan," "Lame Bear," walnut candies, and berry candies.

The food industry should significantly increase the production of packaged goods, and the packaging should be solid and beautiful.

It is also necessary to ensure the sale of so-called accompanying goods in all stores (for example, selling vinegar, mustard, and chili in food stores), canned food stores should sell can openers and knives; wine stores should sell corkscrews and bottle openers. These may seem like small things, but anything that is needed by customers is not a small thing.

There are many serious shortcomings in the trade of potatoes and vegetables, which make the supply of these extremely important foods to residents unsatisfactory. The potatoes and vegetables transported to cities and industrial centers are not sold evenly. Most of the potatoes and vegetables are sold in the period from August to December, while the supply work in January and February forms a serious interruption, so it is necessary to pay attention to the construction of potato and vegetable storage warehouses, and the proper storage of potatoes and vegetables, so that they can be sold uninterruptedly throughout the winter and spring.

This year, measures have been taken to significantly increase the sales volume of watermelons and melons, which to a considerable extent compensate for the shortage of fruits. In two months this year, 453,000 tons of watermelons and melons allocated by the state were sold in cities, while in 1952, only 234,000 tons were sold throughout the year.

The measures currently being implemented to improve horticulture will not take effect so quickly. Therefore, the current task is to fully utilize the existing huge potential to increase the production of watermelons and melons, so that in 1954, these melons can fully supply the market.

In recent years, our residents have increased their demand for improved bread, especially for bread made from high-quality flour, and thus the consumption of ordinary bread has significantly decreased. For example, in Moscow, the average daily sales of high-quality bread before the war were 700,000 to 800,000, and now 2,300,000 are sold; in the Donbass, the sales of long bread and small bread have increased to 10 times that of 1940, and in the Urals, they have increased to 6 times.

The task for the future is to increase the production of improved individual bread made from high-quality flour to 75% by 1956, while before the war, this type of bread was only produced at 20%; individual bread made from rye flour to 40%, while before the war, this type of individual bread was almost not produced.

At the same time as improving the varieties of bread in October this year, many measures have also been taken to further improve the nutritional value and quality of bread and flour in the future. Due to the increase in carbohydrates, beneficial mineral salts, and protein content, the caloric value of bread will be significantly increased. It is necessary to ensure that flour is ground more finely, so that bread made from this type of flour is easier to digest.

Unfortunately, it must be pointed out that we have not yet been able to eliminate the phenomenon of baking bread that does not meet the specifications, such as high moisture and acidity, undercooked and burnt bread. To ensure the different varieties of bread products, our government recently approved a huge plan for the future development of the bread manufacturing industry, improving quality, variety, and bread trade.

In the past few decades, approximately 800 bread manufacturing plants and 1,100 mechanized bread manufacturing plants have been built within the system of the food industry department, and in the next three years, 372 bread manufacturing enterprises will be built, equipped with new equipment, and the manufacturing process will be fully mechanized.

Due to the negligence of the bread and confectionery industries, many urban residents' demand for sweets, large round cakes, and biscuits cannot be satisfied. Therefore, a plan to build 200 specialized confectionery workshops within bread manufacturing plants has been formulated and approved.

In addition to measures to improve the quality of bread and flour, it is necessary to supplement measures to improve the transportation and storage of bread. In many cities, the transportation and storage of bread are improper, piled up in disorder, and do not comply with necessary hygiene requirements, and the loading and unloading of bread is rough, so in many cases, the quality of bread is reduced, kneaded, and loses its original form.

It is necessary to learn from the methods of Moscow, Leningrad, and other large cities, and all cities in the country should use special transportation tools to transport bread, and this work should be completed by 1955.

The sales volume of consumer goods in 1953 has increased significantly compared to the pre-war period.

In 1953, the sales of woolen and silk goods increased to 5.3 times that of 1940, clothing to 2.1 times, bicycles to 6 times, and motorcycles to 100 times, but it is still not enough. The sales volume of cars in 1953 will increase to 1.9 times that of 1950, while before the war, private cars were not sold. It is said that now, people who register to buy cars have to wait for half a year to buy. These special difficulties are different from our past difficulties.

The sales volume of industrial goods this year has increased significantly. This year, the sales volume of textiles, clothing, shoes, knitwear, socks, and stockings is approximately 210 billion rubles, which is 23.5% more than in 1952.

However, the demand of residents for some industrial goods has not been met. We lack patterned and mixed-colored textiles, fine wool, linings, and shirt fabrics, and we lack sewing products made of artificial silk, such as clothing, coats, men's shirts, and women's silk blouses.

Goods are not evenly sent on time; colors, patterns, sizes, and styles are not selected; the orders of trade organizations are often disrupted. For example, the Minsk Industrial Goods Trade Company ordered 37 patterns of printed fabrics for 1953, but in the first quarter, only 3 patterns of printed fabrics were received from the Moscow distribution station; satin should be 15 patterns but only 1 was received. The Kazan Trade Station of the Textile Trade Administration supplied cotton shirts to the trade organizations of the Tatar Soviet Socialist Autonomous Republic in the second quarter, 138% of the order, while satin was 85%, and summer fabrics were 85.2%.

The selection work of trade organizations and stores for the size, style, and color of goods is done in a sloppy manner. Some types, sizes, styles, and colors of goods are out of stock in trade stations and warehouses, but stores are out of stock. The Soviet government, to the greatest extent possible, meets the growing demand of residents for building materials, and in this year, the retail building materials allocated to cities and villages are twice and a half times the amount of building materials allocated for trade last year.

Compared to 1952, the sales volume of building materials to residents and collective farms in 1953 will increase as follows: sawn timber and logs will increase to 3 times, slate to 2.5 times, building nails, iron rods, roofing felt, and cement to 1.8 times, as well as a large amount of dry paint, lead powder, decorative panels, dry plaster, and window glass.

Starting from this year, prefabricated standard houses for individual construction will be sold. Due to the increase in residents' savings, they have the ability to use this money to build private houses and villas in cities and villages.

Starting from 1954, various types of standard houses will be more widely sold in Moscow, Leningrad, and many other cities, and orders from residents for them will be accepted.

Studying the needs of residents and striving to improve the quality of goods

Everyone knows that the nature of Soviet trade determines that it is necessary to comprehensively study the needs of residents and all their various demands. Only on this basis can the correct allocation of goods resources to various regions within the country be guaranteed.

The greatest shortcoming in trade is the unsatisfactory study of the needs of residents for goods, and this shortcoming will become a serious obstacle to the further development of the entire Soviet trade business. It must be frankly said that trade workers have not done a good job of studying the needs of residents, which will lead to serious errors in the allocation of goods plans for provinces, territories, and republics.

In such a large industrial center as Gorky, the study of customers' purchasing needs is only conducted in one store. In Kazan, the study of customers' needs is only arranged in the department store and two industrial goods trade company stores. Many trade organizations study the needs of residents only by filling out forms and reports, and these reports are almost never studied, and they are rarely used in business work. Reports from various places about the study of residents' needs are not analyzed or summarized in the department store, and except for a few cases, they are not actually used at all.

The task of trade is to study the needs of residents and actively influence production, while advocating for the interests of consumers to produce consumer goods according to the needs of the population. If trade organizations do not influence industry and do not defend the interests of buyers, then they are no longer considering the basic principles of Soviet trade.

Trade should not be passive towards the needs of the population. The mission of Soviet trade is to actively influence demand in a progressive spirit. It should cultivate the tastes of consumers, introduce new goods to the population, promote the most nutritious and health-promoting foods, and promote industrial goods that are practical, of good quality, beautiful, and can make the daily and cultural life of the working people more perfect.

Now, due to the new and powerful increase in the production of consumer goods, the role of Soviet trade has become even greater. Trade organizations should accurately and flexibly sell the rapidly growing large quantities of goods, not allowing any congestion in the sale of goods, so that in the next two to three years, all necessary goods can be purchased in every city and agricultural region.

Soviet trade plays a huge role in further developing the economic ties between socialist industry and collective farms, in further strengthening the alliance between the working class and the peasants, and in improving the production of collective farms. The obligation of trade organizations is to thoroughly implement Lenin's instructions: "The state must learn to trade, so that industry can satisfy the peasants, and the peasants can satisfy their needs through trade." (Lenin, Collected Works, Russian edition, Volume 33, page 50)

The great Lenin's call to "learn to trade" is still valid in the current situation. When we transitioned to the New Economic Policy, we had no trading experience and no trading cadres of our own. We started from the most basic knowledge of trade and learned to trade in the competition and struggle with private traders.

Now, under the conditions of the victory of socialism, Soviet trade has entered a new, higher stage of development; it has accumulated rich experience, established and trained a million-strong army of Soviet trade workers. The resources of goods have increased significantly. Now, trade is no longer the trade of the past, and trade workers are no longer the trade workers of the past. However, it must be frankly admitted that trade is lagging behind the rapidly growing demands of the people.

We should cultivate the cultural level of young trade workers, arm them with knowledge, and improve their skills. It is necessary to raise the level of all trade workers to meet the requirements of the current tasks of Soviet trade, cultivate their sensitivity, and carefully treat the demands of consumers, and serve customers with a courteous attitude.

Soviet trade is a socialist method of distribution. The trade of a socialist society is, for the first time in history, trade that serves the people. To implement the grand program of building a communist society in our country, we must, with the greatest determination, develop Soviet trade, fully utilize all its potential, and create the conditions for the implementation of the principles of communist distribution in the future.

Our thirty-plus years of experience in economic construction fully and clearly demonstrates the great superiority of Soviet trade over capitalist trade. The fundamental superiority of our socialist trade lies in the fact that its purpose is to serve people and their needs, to satisfy the needs of Soviet people as fully as possible. In complete contrast, the motive of capitalist trade is to pursue the maximum profit, and the consumer is merely the object of the most unscrupulous plunder by capitalists and speculators.

In bourgeois countries, the stagnation and cyclical decline of trade are the result of the increasing impoverishment of the broad masses of residents.

From 1928 to 1940, the turnover of commodities in the USSR increased by 2.3 times (calculated at comparable prices). In the same period, the turnover of commodities in capitalist countries did not increase but even fell below the level of 1929 on the eve of the Second World War.

In the post-war years, the contrast between the two lines of development was equally clear—the rapid increase in our trade and the stagnation of trade in capitalist countries. In 1952, the turnover of commodities in the United States remained at the level of 1950, while in Britain it even decreased. The USSR's turnover of retail commodities (calculated at comparable prices) increased by two times from 1949 to 1952.

Some people in the United States and Britain still boast about the abundance of consumer goods in their markets. However, in bourgeois countries, while there are many goods in the stores, the people have no money to buy them, so what good is that to them! Today, their situation is worse than in 1929, not to mention the "golden age" of Western European residents before the First World War. Now, the law of development in capitalist countries is such that they are inexorably on a downward slope, moving towards a lower level of consumer goods production.

We are another law. In the years of the Soviet regime, we have advanced very far. Our production, commodity turnover, and consumption are developing in a planned manner, and their speed of development has never been seen even in the best periods of bourgeois countries. Indeed, when we were still a backward and poor country, these countries had already reached a relatively high level of development, but for decades they have stagnated and even regressed, so can they boast about that? Only by comparing our development trends with theirs can we correctly evaluate achievements. There is no doubt that since we have successfully solved the task of developing heavy industry, we can also rapidly develop the production of consumer goods and in this regard, we will also become the richest country, ensuring the highest living standards for the people. Moreover, unlike the capitalist economic system where national wealth does not belong to the people, we strive to ensure the highest level of consumption for the entire population and always consider improving the composition of consumer goods based on scientific requirements in the development of production.

Only in a socialist society can there be a rationally organized trade, whose turnover costs are low and truly cares about the interests of consumers. With the development of Soviet trade, the turnover costs, that is, the costs of goods from production to the hands of consumers, are also constantly decreasing. The Soviet government has shown unremitting concern to reduce these costs to the lowest possible level. Reducing the cost of industrial goods and the turnover costs in trade is the main source of constantly reducing prices. According to the USSR's five-year plan for the development of the national economy from 1951 to 1955, we should reduce the turnover costs of trade by 23%. In further reducing the turnover costs, we have great possibilities, the methods of which are:

First, constantly explore and make full use of internal economic potential, practice economy, and constantly improve the service to consumers;

Second, eliminate losses, the quality of goods must not be reduced, there must be no damage, eliminate unreasonable transportation, and ensure the uninterrupted delivery of goods to trade organizations, vigorously expand the sales of packaged goods and piece goods; equip stores with modern trade equipment and internal transportation tools;

Third, reduce the costs of the trade process, more rationally organize the supply of goods, eliminate redundant links, and reduce the costs of trade management organizations.

One of the greatest advantages of our state and cooperative trade is that it is conducted at fixed prices, which are constantly being reduced. Our consistent reduction of prices is an unshakable principle of the policy of the Soviet government, the purpose of which is to increase the purchasing power of the people and give every member of Soviet society the opportunity to further improve their material well-being.

We even reduce the prices of goods that are still not abundant in quantity if these goods are of great importance to the majority of consumers. It should be noted that this will lead to an increase in demand and will promote us to more rapidly increase the production of goods that are lacking and necessary for residents.

Since 1947, our country has reduced prices six times, thereby reducing the overall price level by more than half, and the purchasing power of the Soviet ruble has increased to more than twice. The residents have benefited a lot.

In contrast, the trade of capitalist countries, whose prices are free, capitalists and speculators do not miss any opportunity to raise prices, enriching themselves at the expense of the hunger and poverty of the working people. After the war, in all capitalist countries, prices soared speculatively, thereby further lowering the consumption and living standards of the working people.

Since 1947, the USSR has reduced the prices of bread, meat, and fats by two-thirds, while in France, the prices of these items have doubled, in Britain, the price of bread has increased by approximately two times, meat by 1.5 times, and fats by 2.5 times. In the United States, the prices of these items have also increased, although slightly less.

In our Soviet trade, there is no smell of merchants. Trade workers should strictly adhere to the prescribed prices, and any violation of these prices is considered a crime. Soviet law strictly protects the interests of consumers.

In this regard, the State Trade Inspection plays a huge role. The State Trade Inspection is the plenipotentiary representative of the state conducting supervision, and it should resolutely fight against attempts to violate the prescribed prices, resolutely fight against deceptive behavior towards customers, and take measures to prevent such violations.

The public supervision of the trade unions also has important significance. When the working masses also participate in supervision, such supervision becomes a great social force. The responsibility of the leaders of trade organizations is to make full use of this supervision to improve trade operations, assist and promote the work of inspectors.

The comprehensive inspection of the quality of goods sold to residents is one of the manifestations of the Soviet government's unremitting concern for the well-being and health of the people.

During the years of the Soviet regime, a complete system of state inspection of commodity quality has been established, and the quality is inspected in special laboratories according to scientific methods, and sanitary inspections are organized for industrial enterprises, trade organizations, and public catering enterprises. The activities of institutions such as the Food Quality Inspection Bureau and the Consumer Goods Quality Inspection Bureau are of primary importance in the inspection work. These inspection bureaus were previously subordinate to various industrial ministries, but now they have been transferred to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Trade, which is a new great help to trade and makes it easier to carry out the struggle to improve the quality of consumer goods.

We strive to make both expensive and inexpensive goods of excellent quality without exception. The old merchant's standard of "expensive is good, cheap is bad" is not our standard.

In capitalist trade, under the law of "no deception, no sale," counterfeit and counterfeit goods are widely sold. If selling spoiled and harmful goods can bring profits to capitalists, then they do not care about people's health.

The Soviet state has established a new type of trade that meets the needs of a socialist society, free from the vices and poisons of capitalist trade.

We have standard trading enterprises: food stores, department stores, and specialty stores that are envied by other countries. Now the task is to raise all our trade organizations to the level of the above-mentioned stores.

It should be noted that even under competitive conditions, in the face of increasing sales difficulties, bourgeois countries also set some not bad examples in the organization of trading enterprises, in trade technology, and in serving customers, especially wealthy customers.

Some comrades, under the pretext of opposing the worship of foreigners, ignore foreign experience, do not pay attention to foreign experience, do not study it, and do not use the things that are useful to us. These comrades cannot but be reprimanded.

On the one hand, we widely promote the advanced experience of our good trading enterprises, and on the other hand, we also learn from the better enterprises of bourgeois countries, use the things that are useful to us in their trade and customer service work, do not despise the use of this beneficial experience, and apply this experience for the benefit of the broad masses.

Our task is to resolutely expose and eliminate the shortcomings that exist in our trade, strive to improve trade work according to the requirements of the Soviet government and the Communist Party, and raise trade work to the level of socialist society laborers.

Title: The Soviet Trade Department and Industrial Department's Interests Are One: Improving Product Quality and Caring for the People's Welfare
Author:

Page: 1

Xinhua News Agency, October 25th.

The distribution of goods to various regions within the country and the supply of goods to trade organizations have, up to now, still been conducted according to the types agreed upon with the supply units. Due to inadequate research on the market situation and the types of goods needed by residents in various regions within the country, errors were made during the negotiation of types. The demands of life have greatly changed, but the negotiated types remain the same. Therefore, in reality, the negotiated types often become the types that are forcibly sold.

According to the current basic conditions for supply, trade organizations should select goods according to the negotiated types. If trade organizations do not adopt goods from the "agreed" types, they cannot replace them with other goods needed by residents in that region. This method may be convenient for lazy workers in sales outlets, but it only harms trade.

At the meeting of managers of textile trade sales outlets of the All-Union Textile Trade Organization, many facts were presented proving that the allocation of goods was incorrect, goods were forcibly delivered to trade organizations, and the work of studying residents' demands was unsatisfactory. As a result, only the allocation plans for individual regions were significantly revised.

In 1953, there were several proposals to change the types of products, but the Trade Department submitted these proposals too late, and by then, warehouses and sales outlets already had an excessive accumulation of goods that were not selling well.

The current system for studying residents' demands is executed too centrally—too much material is concentrated in the Trade Department, even unnecessary material, all of which comes to the center. In negotiating the supply of certain goods to meet residents' demands, local authorities should be granted more authority.

Both wholesale and retail trade organizations should study the demands of urban and rural residents. Efforts should be made to promote the experience of holding customer meetings, advocate the adoption of citizens' suggestions, organize various product exhibitions and goods classification exhibition rooms, and use newspapers for publicity, etc.

In studying and more fully meeting residents' needs, the role and significance of commodity inspectors are particularly great. No one can, like a skilled commodity inspector, correctly identify the types and quality of goods received from industrial departments, whether they meet the requirements and preferences of customers.

However, in our country, the significance of commodity inspectors has been reduced. I believe that, just as the chief engineer in a factory is second only to the director, in trade organizations, the commodity inspector should be the second person to inspect the types and quality of goods. From now on, his role in trade should be enhanced, so that the issues of quality and classification will be more smoothly resolved.

Our Party and government have always been vigilant in paying attention to the issue of improving product quality. Trade organizations bear a major responsibility for delivering only high-quality goods to consumers. Trade workers come into contact with millions of Soviet customers every day, and salespeople are the first to hear customers' opinions on the goods sold.

Trade workers are directly responsible for the goods sold to customers. They must reflect the interests of customers and, in front of industrial departments, in terms of the types and quality of goods, safeguard the interests of customers, and not allow substandard goods to enter trade organizations.

Trade organizations have all the means to use economic levers to strive for the improvement of commodity quality and types. Trade workers have the responsibility to demand that industrial departments produce new goods, and they should become promoters of new goods, constantly pushing industrial departments to produce high-quality goods that residents require.

To improve commodity quality, the government has ordered the Light Industry Department to increase the production of high-quality woolen goods, such as "Boston" brand, "Underground Railroad" brand, "Lifebuoy" brand, "Strike Force" brand, cloth and thick cloth, "Capital" brand, and others; improve the finishing of silk goods, increase their durability, increase the production of printed textiles, try to reduce the shrinkage of man-made fiber textiles, and improve the artistic decoration of textiles.

It is planned to significantly increase the production of man-made fiber textiles that consumers prefer. The textiles produced by the First Printed Fabric Factory and the Three Hills Textile Mill in Moscow are not worthy of mention. They are very famous enterprises, but the man-made fiber textiles they produce are not good. Customers are complaining about these textiles.

The man-made fiber textiles produced by the Sverdlov Factory in Moscow are good and can satisfy customers, so they prefer to buy these textiles rather than foreign textiles, while the Three Hills Textile Mill and the First Printed Fabric Factory started producing man-made fiber textiles without adequate preparation, and they will be embarrassed for this.

It is no longer possible to tolerate the production of textiles with monotonous colors, dull, gray, and poor patterns by the light industry department. The industrial department should produce textiles with bright, pleasant colors that do not fade easily.

The light industry department should design and produce clothes according to the seasons that meet the requirements and preferences of consumers. An inseparable factor of quality is the appearance of the product, such as decoration, elegant and durable packaging, and beautiful labels.

It should be noted that some industrial enterprises have good product decoration, but this does not mean that all enterprises in the Soviet Union, republics, cooperatives, and local, especially district-level, enterprises have done this. The task is to make backward enterprises catch up with the advanced level. All our enterprises should produce high-quality goods, with firm and beautiful external decoration and packaging, not inferior to good foreign styles.

Consumers' demands on industrial departments, especially food departments, are reasonable. They require that the most widely sold goods can be stored for a long time and maintain their quality. It is not allowed for new products to have good quality in the initial period, and then the producer's attention is relaxed, thus reducing the quality. It is also not allowed for industrial departments to stop producing goods that are in high demand.

The phenomenon of tolerating the entry of substandard goods into trade organizations among trade workers has not yet been eliminated. When industrial departments supply goods that are not popular with residents, with outdated styles, and poor external decoration, they often take it lightly.

Of course, the leaders of industrial departments will say: chemists do not give us dyes, what can we do. Industrial workers and trade workers are kind-hearted, so their hearts soften. They should have hearts of iron—never yield. Light industry workers should urge chemists and not be soft-hearted in front of chemists, demanding all the necessary dyes from them. Any concession in this regard is opportunism, and opportunism can only destroy the cause.

Bolsheviks have never aligned with weaknesses, because this alignment is contrary to the essence of actively striving for the people's well-being. The army of trade workers should act on the principle of overcoming, eliminating, and compensating for weaknesses, rather than yielding to weaknesses. Therefore, the conclusion is: trade workers should not tolerate the reasons given by suppliers if these reasons violate the interests of consumers.

Trade workers strive to obtain the types of goods needed, strive for high-quality goods with good decoration, which not only protects the interests of consumers but also protects the interests of the state and helps industrial department workers to raise the quality of their work to a new, higher level.

The interests of the Soviet trade department and industrial department are one: improving commodity quality and caring for the people's welfare. To improve trade, wholesale organizations have been transferred from industrial departments to the trade department.

The transfer of wholesale organizations is not just a general transfer from one supervisory department to another, but a fundamental change in trade organizations, which is being implemented for the first time in the history of Soviet trade development. Transferring wholesale organizations from industrial departments to the trade department is to put the interests of customers first and the convenience of industrial departments second.

The profound significance of the resolution passed by the government on the issues of wholesale trade and commodity quality inspection lies in this. The wholesale organizations of the Soviet Trade Department should significantly enhance their role in striving for improved commodity quality and the necessary types of goods. They should be sensitive to the demands of retail trade organizations and strive to help them improve trade, solve the problem of eliminating the detour transportation of goods, and expand the direct delivery of goods from industrial enterprises to trade enterprises, etc.

One of the shortcomings in the formulation of plans is the lack of necessary connection between the commodity turnover plans of local trade organizations and shops and the supply of goods for these plans. As a result, some organizations receive more goods than needed to complete the commodity turnover plan, while others receive fewer goods than the plan requires. And if we consider that the wages of shop and trade company workers change according to the degree of plan completion, then the significance of this shortcoming is even more profound.

Improving several issues in Soviet family life and public catering

Ulyanov Lenin attached great importance to the transformation of household affairs, considering it a condition for the struggle for communism. He wrote: "Women are oppressed, suffocated, and degraded by petty household chores, making them stupid and despised, confining them to cooking and child-rearing, wasting their labor in extremely unproductive, petty, labor-intensive, stupid, and tormenting work." "The real liberation of women, real communism, can only begin and exist where and when the universal struggle (led by the proletariat in power) against petty household chores begins, more precisely, when petty household chores begin to be universally transformed into large-scale socialist economics." (Lenin's Collected Works, Volume 29, Page 396)

The universal transformation of petty household chores can proceed in several directions, and this issue has great significance. The mechanization of household labor, more precisely, the mechanization of household labor, is of great importance. Now we have all the means to seriously pay attention to the production and use of modern consumer tools and perfect machines to serve and improve our lives.

The Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have determined a large-scale plan for the production of household machines. In 1955, 196,000 washing machines will be produced, about eleven times that of 1953; 330,000 household refrigerators will be produced, while this year only 62,000 were produced; the production of vacuum cleaners will increase fivefold, reaching about 500,000 per year; the production of electric floor polishers will increase tenfold. The production of daily kitchen utensils, such as potato washers, vegetable processing tools, bread slicers, dishwashers, electric pots, and kettles, will also significantly increase.

Some skeptics, especially those with malicious intentions, will say, "There's nothing surprising about this!" Of course, we do not intend to surprise anyone with the production scale of our washing machines, vacuum cleaners, or refrigerators at this moment. We are just starting this work, but we are prepared to make up for the previous lack of production speed, which may surprise any skeptic.

These machines will become indispensable furniture in most Soviet households in our socialist country in the near future.

In 1956, the production of sewing machines will reach three million, almost seventeen times that of the pre-war year 1940. Starting from 1954, our industry will produce portable and convenient electric sewing machines. This new type of sewing machine will be very convenient for women in our country.

To the greatest extent possible, the development of public catering is an important factor in improving services to the working people and transforming petty household chores. In some of our residents, there is a deeply rooted incorrect view that canteens are only needed in times of necessity. Some public catering workers' neglect of their duties (they forget that they should prepare delicious food and forget that they should serve customers quickly and attentively) to a considerable extent, has fostered this view.

As with everything else, in public catering, cadres decide everything. The chef is one of the most important workers in our public catering; and the profession of a chef is one of the most honorable and respected professions, because the work of a chef directly affects the health and working capacity of millions of people every day.

Until recently, the system of calculating the wages of canteen workers according to the monetary value of dishes stimulated the production of high-priced dishes, thereby weakening the production of vegetables, flour, and coarse grain dishes that require labor-intensive preparation, and reducing the quality of food preparation.

Now this shortcoming has been eliminated. Since October 1953, medium and large canteens have changed to calculating the wages of kitchen workers according to the number of dishes.

It is necessary to explain the basic types of public catering enterprises and the tasks of each type. Enterprises attached to enterprises, because they have a fixed number of diners, can fully consider the requirements and tastes of diners. In various factories and mines, there are already many model canteens. Examples include the canteen of the "Ordzhonikidze Coal Trust," the canteen of the "Lenin Oil Trust," the canteen of metallurgists in Kirovograd, and others. However, it is regrettable that there are still many canteens that work poorly and are rightly criticized by residents. The managers of enterprises and public catering workers should strive to fundamentally improve the work of canteens attached to enterprises.

Some workers regard the rapid establishment of snack bars today as a shortcoming in public catering, which is incorrect. Snack bars help us solve an important task, that is, to ensure that everyone can quickly and well eat something delicious during the lunch break. We should develop a network of snack bars with good supply and attentive service.

Similarly, efforts should be made to significantly improve the work of student canteens and food kiosks, organizing the preparation of meals according to the students' budget.

Public catering enterprises should be managed so that diners do not waste a lot of time waiting for food, but use the time to eat quietly and comfortably. Academician Pavlov firmly proposed that food should not be eaten hastily, but slowly, because "due to eating too fast and not paying attention during meals, the excitement has not reached sufficient intensity, so sufficient digestive juices are not secreted to digest the food" (Pavlov's Collected Works, Volume 2, Book 1, Page 262).

Properly organizing children's nutrition in schools will greatly reduce the troubles of Soviet families. In most schools, we have well-equipped kiosks. However, the service to students is unsatisfactory; school canteens are insufficient. School kiosks and canteens should prepare special nutritious food for children according to the special requirements of children's physical growth.

Public catering enterprises should have a variety of dishes, make the dishes look beautiful, attract people, and stimulate their appetite. Efforts should be made to widely promote the delivery of prepared meals and cooked dishes to households, which can also reduce household chores.

The work of restaurants should be improved, service should be more attentive, and the quality of cooking various dishes should be significantly improved, reaching the point where a whole family can go to a restaurant and entertain guests, hold family banquets, so that not only the husband but also the wife can celebrate the holiday; otherwise, if guests are invited to the house, all family members celebrate the holiday, but the hostess is an exception. For her, guests coming to the house means non-stop labor and exhaustion. Finally, the work of restaurants in stations, ports, and airports should be improved, and the work of dining cars should be significantly improved.

The organization of mass entertainment and parades is also of great significance for serving the working people. For this, it is necessary to organize mobile enterprises, with the help of which it is possible to organize services for residents in any place in the city or outside the city.

At the beginning of this year, there were 100,060 public catering enterprises, an increase of 24.3% compared to 1940, but this is still not satisfactory. The increase in public catering enterprises lags behind the development of urban economics, and there are many examples where, even in Moscow, when a large number of residential buildings are built, there are not enough canteens and snack bars. The residents of the new Sand District and the Textile Workers' Residential District in Moscow have a population equivalent to that of a city, but there are neither canteens nor snack bars there. This defect should be quickly eliminated. It is planned to open 11,000 new restaurants, canteens, snack bars, and other public catering enterprises in 1954-1956.

One of the ways to reduce the household labor of our women is for industry to increase the production of ready-made meat pies, meat, fish semi-finished products, and various cooked dishes, and for shops to increase their sales. In 1955, the production of small sausages and short sausages is planned to increase to twice that of 1953, meat semi-finished products to three times, dumplings to twice, meat pies to 1.8 times, fish semi-finished products and loin meat, as well as cooked meat and fish products, the production and sales volume will be significantly increased.

Widely developing tailoring shops and rapidly increasing the sale of factory-made durable clothing can also reduce the labor of our Soviet women in some aspects, so that they do not have to constantly sew clothes at home. Efforts should be made to rapidly increase enterprises that can reduce women's household labor in many aspects, such as laundries, chemical laundries, clothing and shoe repair shops, and other daily social service enterprises.

Improving the service level of trade

The more domestic goods there are, the higher the requirements of Soviet consumers will be not only for the quality of goods but also for the quality of trade services. One of the most important tasks of trade organizations is to significantly improve the service level of Soviet trade.

The service level of trade is not only reflected in making the appearance of shops beautiful, keeping the business premises and other rooms clean and tidy, but also in displaying goods prominently and beautifully, clearly marking all varieties of goods, quickly delivering goods, and providing other assistance to buyers, such as measuring clothing sizes, cutting fabric, delivering goods to the buyer's home, etc.

To make the shop orderly and the service attentive, the shop manager is the first to rely on. The manager of a trade enterprise should be a good organizer, a civilized educator of trade workers, a business expert, and should attentively listen to customers' various requirements for the quality of goods and strive to make the industrial department execute these requirements.

We have some excellent department stores, food stores, and industrial goods stores that truly care about customers and the service spirit of trade organizations. However, the general level of trade service is not up to the new requirements. Our task is to strive to complete the commodity turnover plan successfully, launch a socialist competition for model service to residents, widely explore and promote new ideas in all links of trade, and bring all trade enterprises to an advanced level.

One of the fundamental issues in improving the service level of trade is to package and sell food and industrial goods beautifully. In this regard, industrial departments should play a major role, and they must reorganize and produce the largest number of packaged and packaged goods. However, a large part of this work depends on trade workers. Goods are often carelessly wrapped in paper. To buy a little caviar, cottage cheese, cheese, honey, jam, fruit preserves, customers have to bring their own containers when they enter the store, which should be provided by the industrial department for sale.

If it is said that in recent years, although there are still serious shortcomings, the service level of some food and industrial goods trade has improved, then the improvement of vegetable and potato trade has done very little. Many trade workers can indifferently let potatoes and vegetables be sold with dirt, and vegetables are already wilted when they are sold, and customers have to bring a basket or bag to buy these things. This situation is unacceptable. Now, it is necessary to gradually make customers be able to buy potatoes packed in paper bags or net bags, and pickled cabbage in cans or small barrels.

Many leaders of trade organizations do not care about adopting very simple machinery to improve the labor productivity of salespeople, greatly reduce their labor, and ensure faster and more accurate delivery of goods. Therefore, our task is to use these simple machines as much as possible and widely adopt new machines that can improve the service level of trade.

The service level of trade also requires good advertising. The task of our Soviet advertising is to report to the people accurate knowledge about goods, help them pay attention to new goods, cultivate new tastes and needs, promote new goods, and explain the methods of using goods. Our Soviet advertising has no phenomenon of abuse as caused by capitalist competition, such as in the United States in 1951, the expenditure on advertising reached 6.5 billion dollars. The shocking thing about this expenditure is that it is equivalent to 2.3 times the total expenditure of the US government on education and social insurance. Advertising in capitalist countries is not a means of serving the interests of consumers, but a means of competition among merchants to attract customers, and often deceives customers.

The most important thing about Soviet advertising is that it should explain the content, quality, and characteristics of goods with sincere, correct, and clear words. People remember the apt words written by our great poet Mayakovsky for advertising:

"	There is no need to
		Hesitate and consider—
	Women's things
		Are all in the state stores."
		"Such good nipples
		Unprecedented—
	I want to suck it
		Until old age."
		"Salads, sauces, and other delicious dishes
		Use this oil
		Unprecedented."

We have many advertisements that are not lively, formulaic, and inflexible. For example, we can still encounter such an advertisement now: "Please drink beer from the breweries of the Beer Management Bureau." We should seriously develop our advertising industry and make it a powerful assistant to customers. To improve the advertising industry, it is necessary to organize modern production for the materials and materials needed for advertising and display windows to replace handmade products.

Unfortunately, salespeople still have a neglectful, indifferent, and often rude attitude towards customers. This is unacceptable. Soviet shop workers should respect customers, and we should make great efforts in courtesy. Whether in shops, on trams, or on the streets, courtesy is insufficient. The general task is to pay attention to courtesy among each other, courtesy to women, and courtesy to children.

Shops should be courteous in reception, but we have done very poorly in this regard. There was an incident where a female salesperson in the textile department of the Stalingrad Department Store said to a customer who asked her where to buy calico, "I am not your information desk, citizen." What kind of attitude is this?

When a Soviet person enters a shop, he should be in a good mood because he buys satisfactory things, because of the quality and appearance of the goods he buys. He should be able to believe that the things he buys will satisfy all members of his family—adults and children. This mood is greatly related to: how he will be received, how the goods will be presented to him, and how much time he spends buying. Therefore, it is required that a trade worker should be courteous to customers and show concern.

Trade workers should also ask customers to be courteous to them and respect the labor of salespeople. In this regard, there are also cases where some customers make unreasonable demands and sometimes treat salespeople with contempt.

The attitude of contempt for Soviet trade workers is a remnant of the old era. This attitude should be thoroughly eliminated. Our Soviet trade workers have no thoughts of chasing profits and merchant habits. They are a brigade in the army of socialist labor, performing the glorious task of daily service to the people. Comrade Stalin said that trade in our country has long become our own Bolshevik business, and trade workers, as long as they work sincerely, are the servants of our revolutionary Bolshevik cause.

There are more than three million people working in state and cooperative trade, which is a large army of laborers. Our achievements will depend on the improvement of the selection, training, and education of cadres. The Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have decided to transfer the management of five colleges to the Soviet Trade Department and increase the enrollment quota, and also transfer one academy to the All-Union Central Consumer Cooperative. This will make the training of college students in colleges more in line with the actual needs of trade and strengthen the assistance of scientific workers in colleges to the Trade Department. Even in trade work, we cannot advance without science.

We also need to strengthen the work of training some trade workers with rich practical experience to become experts with higher or secondary education, sending them to two-year cadre training classes and higher trade schools, the enrollment quota of which will be increased to 1,200 per year. The enrollment quota of the Soviet Trade Correspondence Institute and the correspondence department of vocational schools will be significantly increased.

Efforts should be made to train salespeople, chefs, and other general workers in training classes, trade and cooking schools, and through individual or group training methods. This is an important method for training young cadres who have graduated from seven-year schools. From 1954 to 1955, we should train 25,000 people in trade and cooking schools and various specialized trade schools each year, train 25,000 people through individual and group training, and train 128,000 trade workers through various training methods to improve their skills.

Many leaders of trade organizations are still indifferent to the selection of cadres and do not study them in actual work.

Trade workers are entrusted with the handling of large quantities of material wealth, and they should protect them like protecting their own eyes. However, there are still phenomena of waste and theft in trade organizations. Although inspections are often conducted, almost every month, many of these inspections are superficial. It is now decided not to conduct such frequent inspections, but to invite some more skilled workers to conduct more thorough inspections. In the work of protecting state funds and wealth, the task of trade workers is to ensure timely inspection of commodity quality documents and inventory of property in shops, warehouses, and freight stations to create an environment free of waste and theft.

We are on the eve of a great prosperity of Soviet trade, and newspapers are one of the means to ensure that the line of our Party is implemented in trade. Therefore, it is decided to publish the Trade Newspaper, which began to be issued from November 1953, which is not accidental but of great significance. We now urgently need a forum for all-Union newspapers to spread advanced experience, skillfully and quickly grasp and vigorously publicize new, advanced, and promising things in trade, criticize outdated and conservative phenomena. The newspaper should regularly publish the voices of consumers and their demands on trade and industry, so that they can also find interesting things in the Trade Newspaper, not just those that only interest Soviet trade workers.

One of the important conditions for improving trade services is that shops, restaurants, canteens, cafes, and kiosks should operate at the most convenient time for the majority of customers. In recent months, new operating hours for shops, restaurants, canteens, cafes, and kiosks have been regulated in various republics and cities. Many of them have increased working shifts. At the same time, they have taken into account local conditions, characteristics, and the characteristics of work in various types of trade enterprises, which was not done before.

Strengthening the material and technical foundation of trade

In the few years after the war, 136,000 new shops and 85,000 sales outlets were opened, and the number of specialized shops was increased. Now there are about 43,000 specialized shops in total. Specialized shops account for 45% of the total trade network in cities and workers' towns. The specialized shops that increased particularly rapidly in the post-war period are: shoe stores increased to 9.5 times that of 1940, fabric stores increased to 4.4 times, clothing stores increased to 1.7 times. Specialized shops have created more convenient conditions for customers and have more comprehensively studied customers' needs.

However, the growth rate of retail commodity turnover within the country is faster than the development of the trade enterprise network. According to comparable prices, the retail commodity turnover in 1953 was 79% higher than in 1940, while the number of retail trade enterprises had only increased by 8.4% by the beginning of this year, and the number of sales counters in enterprises had increased by 7.8%. This undoubtedly affects the service to customers and makes the work of many urban shops overloaded.

It should be noted that in recent years, the Coal Industry Department, Oil Industry Department, and Metallurgical Industry Department have been carrying out large-scale construction of shops and canteens with good equipment in mines, oil fields, and factories. However, some trade organizations have not satisfactorily completed their tasks of developing the trade network in 1953. For example, in the local trade of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (Minister is Comrade Sakhnovskiy), the annual plan stipulated the establishment of 285 new shops, but only 60 were established in the first half of the year; in the local trade of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (Minister is Comrade Kotovodov), the annual plan stipulated the establishment of 77 new shops, but only 21 were established in the first half of the year.

Special attention should be paid to such intolerable facts as the closure of some existing shops for various reasons. In the first half of this year, 1,940 shops were closed for various reasons.

Under the lax management of local trade organizations, until now, there is still the phenomenon of using shop buildings for other purposes. In Moscow, the work of trade organizations is very busy, but more than 100 shop buildings located in the lower floors of new residential buildings have been used for other purposes. The Soviet Trade Department and the Moscow City Soviet are taking measures to vacate these buildings to be used directly for commerce. Such measures should also be adopted in other cities in the Soviet Union.

In some places, the distribution of shops is haphazard, and local trade organizations have not taken the necessary measures to organize and carry out this work.

In some cities, it is appropriate to adopt measures to merge existing trade enterprises, as long as it is beneficial to better serve customers, which can eliminate many shortcomings in trade organizations.

The trade organizations of Moscow City have merged 182 small shops in 1952-1953, used 19 shop buildings that were previously used for other purposes, and organized 88 large food and industrial goods stores. In addition to Moscow, many other cities, such as Leningrad, Riga, Kiev, and Odessa, have also carried out the work of merging shops. This is only the beginning of a major and beneficial work. Many shops have poor equipment, and their buildings also need major repairs. The landlords usually refuse to carry out major repairs, but trade organizations have no right to spend money to carry out major repairs on the rented buildings. Therefore, now the authority is granted to each trade organization to use 50% or less of the rent as the major repair fee for the commercial buildings they rent.

To eliminate the backwardness of the retail trade network, it is planned to build and open 40,000 shops in cities and rural areas in 1954-1956, while only 19,000 were built in the past three years. In the next three years, it is planned to build 100 large and medium-sized department stores in the centers of regions and industrial cities.

Investment in the material and technical foundation of trade is rapidly increasing. The Trade Department will allocate 1.7 billion rubles for this purpose in 1954, while in 1953 it was only 750 million rubles, an increase of 2.3 times.

Recently, the largest department store in the Soviet Union, the State Department Store, will open on Red Square in Moscow. It will be equipped with advanced modern trade equipment.

The upper floor of the building on Red Square, which was previously occupied by various organizations, has been vacated and renovated into the building of the State Department Store. Before the revolution, many merchants had opened about 240 small trade enterprises here. In the State Department Store, Soviet consumers can buy a wide variety of high-quality goods.

A large men's and women's ready-made clothing store and a custom-made personal clothing store will be opened in the department store. The State Department Store Management Bureau will open the largest food store in the lower floor of the State Department Store. More than 1,000 salespeople will work simultaneously in the State Department Store, and the total length of the counters will reach 2.5 kilometers.

Undoubtedly, the new State Department Store will not be the same as the old State Department Store. The words that Mayakovsky once said about the State Department Store are more suitable for the new State Department Store. He wrote in an advertisement: "Everything needed for the stomach, body, or brain—all in the State Department Store." We want to make the operation of trade align with the State Department Store. The building of the Rublyovsky Market in Moscow, which is currently occupied by various organizations, will be organized into a department store "Children's World" with 300 sales counters. This will be a state children's department store established for young Soviet consumers. In addition, several large stores need to be established.

In 1949, only 5% of the state trade organizations' food stores and canteens had cold storage equipment. By July 1, 1953, the number of state trade organizations' stores and canteens equipped with compression-type refrigerators was about seven times that of 1949, that is, 12.5 times that of 1940.

Only in the system of the Soviet Trade Department, by the beginning of this year, 54% of the stores selling perishable goods and 50% of the public catering enterprises have installed mechanical refrigeration equipment. In the next three years, it is planned to increase the production of compression-type refrigerators and cold storage equipment by at least three times and further improve and improve these equipment.

Properly establishing warehouses is of great significance for the correct organization of trade.

Currently, trade warehouses are in a completely neglected state. We have made great progress only in the field of cold storage, and its area has increased to twice that of 1940. From a technical level, our cold storage industry can compete with the cold storage equipment of any developed capitalist country. However, the capacity of food warehouses of wholesale trade organizations in 1953 was still not up to the pre-war level, 528,000 tons in 1940, but only 300,000 tons in 1953.

In the post-war period, the destruction of the war has not been completely eliminated, and warehouses for storing vegetables and potatoes that meet the current needs in terms of quantity have not been built. In particular, a part of the temporary warehouses have collapsed. Therefore, the capacity of vegetable and potato warehouses was only 2,396,000 tons by January 1, 1954, a decrease of 30% compared to 1940.

Industrial goods warehouses are, as usual, scattered and located in inappropriate places, which makes it impossible for retail trade to carry out necessary commodity classification.

Of course, even if the warehouses are insufficient, excellent organizers are still arranging work. Therefore, now we should improve wholesale trade and not wait until we build many perfect warehouses before taking action. Now we should take practical measures to improve the service to retail trade.

The approach taken in the construction of new warehouses is fundamentally incorrect. Now each wholesale organization has established individual, independent small warehouses in various corners of the city, which are scattered and hinder the supply work of retail trade.

It is obvious that to reduce construction costs, especially to reduce the cost of using warehouses, to ensure the mechanization of loading and unloading work, wholesale warehouses must be concentrated in one place, one large building, or a series of large buildings, in small cities only in one place, and in large cities in several main areas.

Recently, the government has approved a large plan to carry out large-scale construction of cold storage and wholesale warehouses for storing food and industrial goods, vegetable and potato storage, and small wholesale warehouses of local trade offices.

We should organize large, cooperative warehouses to replace scattered, individually managed warehouses that require high turnover costs. The loading and unloading of goods, various operations within the warehouse, and the entire sending work of these large, cooperative warehouses are fully mechanized.

The rational form of warehouse organization is to organize public warehouses. In 1954, it is planned to start the construction of large wholesale warehouses in Moscow, Leningrad, Baku, Rostov, Kuybyshev, Stalino, and other cities.

The business of warehouses is not only needed for storing current materials but also requires a large area to store seasonal goods to ensure the supply of various goods needed by residents throughout the year. For example, factories that produce felt boots work all year round, but residents only start buying felt boots in autumn or early winter, which means that warehouses are needed to store these goods in summer. Boots, summer textiles, and all seasonal goods are the same, because these goods are produced all year round, but the demand is seasonal. For example, in spring, summer textiles and shoes are not enough, but in winter, these goods pile up in the shops. The same is true for food, such as animal oil, meat, fish, and sugar, the seasonal storage problem is also very acute, because their production is seasonal, but the demand is constant.

To improve the organization of trade and ensure the smooth delivery of goods to shops, we must organize specialized automobile transportation on a large scale in a short period.

Regrettably, due to the lack of specialized transport vehicles, a large part of perishable goods, clothing, furniture, and other goods are still transported on ordinary trucks, which causes damage to goods or makes them lose their original shape.

Our task is to fundamentally reorganize the transportation of food and industrial goods and increase the number of specialized transport vehicles for trade to at least 20,000 in the next two to three years. Specialized transport vehicles should also serve as material advertisements for goods transportation. This transportation will also, to some extent, activate and decorate the streets and make customers pleased.

When loading goods at the supply point, the manpower and resources of the supplier should be used, and when unloading goods at the trade enterprise, the resources of the trade organization should be used. Sometimes, when transporting goods by truck, there are porters sitting on the truck, which is unacceptable. We should quickly eliminate the phenomenon of porters sitting on the truck from the loading point to the unloading point.

On further developing cooperative and collective farm trade

Due to the victory of the collective farm system, the face of our countryside has fundamentally changed. Therefore, we should put forward other requirements for rural trade.

In our socialist society, the development of urban and rural commodity circulation promotes the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance, and the form of commodity combination supplements the form of production combination between the working class and peasants.

Rural trade is also rapidly growing. In 1953, the commodity circulation in rural areas increased to 7.9 times that of 1925 (according to comparable prices), and it also far exceeded the commodity circulation before the war in 1940.

This year, due to the implementation of supplementary measures to greatly expand our country's commodity circulation, the commodity circulation in rural areas has also significantly increased. If the commodity circulation of consumer cooperatives in the first quarter of 1953 increased by 3.5% compared to the same period last year, then in the second quarter it increased by 28% compared to the same period last year, and in the third quarter it increased by 27.5% compared to the same period last year. This shows that rural trade has also started to rise rapidly. The structure of rural trade has changed. Currently, the demand for personal consumer goods of rural residents is increasingly approaching the demand of urban residents.

It is meaningful to cite the following materials: in the 1924-1925 fiscal year, salt, kerosene, matches, household soap, and cotton textiles accounted for approximately 35% of the total commodity circulation of rural cooperatives, while in 1952, these goods accounted for only 18%, although the quantity has increased significantly.

If the total sales volume of various textiles by consumer cooperatives in 1952 increased by 41% compared to 1940 (according to comparable prices), then silk textiles increased to 3.1 times. The sales volume of silk ready-made clothing in rural areas has increased fivefold in the past three years, woolen clothing has increased to 2.6 times, and woolen overcoats have increased to 2.2 times. In 1953, the bicycles sold in rural areas will be six times that of 1940, radios will be 13.6 times, sewing machines will be six times, and cameras will be 4.8 times. This is due to the improvement of the material well-being of collective farmers and rural intellectuals.

The number of teachers in the countryside of the Soviet Union in 1952 was seven times that of 1913, agronomists and other agricultural experts were thirty times, doctors were seven times. There are about two million agricultural machinery operators in the countryside of the Soviet Union.

If in 1925, that is, before the collectivization of agriculture in our country, the publications sold in the countryside accounted for only 4.6% of the total circulation, then in 1952 it accounted for 25.9%.

The expansion of the scope of rural construction has led to a huge demand for building materials. In the past year, the government has taken measures to greatly increase the supply of building materials to rural areas. In 1953, the wood and timber sold in rural areas will be 13.3 times that of 1940, that is, 4.5 times that of the first five-year plan period after the war; cement will be 43 times, that is, twice that of the first five-year plan period after the war; roofing felt will be nearly twenty times, that is, 2.5 times that of the five-year plan period; nails will be 4.5 times, that is, twice that of 1946-1950.

All this shows that the countryside is in a completely different stage of development, and cooperatives have taken on new significance and assumed new tasks.

Our task is to eliminate as quickly as possible all the shortcomings in the trade of building materials in the countryside.

In recent years, the technical transformation of agriculture has produced some new departments in rural trade, especially the trade of goods with production purposes.

In 1953, the number of trucks allocated for sale in rural areas was almost equal to the total number of the past five years (from the end of 1946 to the end of 1950), excluding those allocated to machine-tractor stations.

The task of consumer cooperative workers is to continuously carry out the trade of goods with production purposes.

Consumer cooperatives are powerful public trade organizations. They have more than 32 million members. However, rural trade lags behind the growing needs of rural residents.

First, consumer cooperatives cannot guarantee the supply of many goods needed by rural residents. Even now, consumer cooperatives have not eliminated such a shameful fact that daily necessities such as kerosene, matches, and salt, which should be supplied to cooperatives in unlimited quantities, are still intermittently supplied.

Second, consumer cooperative organizations rarely study the needs of rural residents for goods, and in individual cases, they do not even consider these needs.

Third, the problem of developing the trade network in rural areas has not been given the necessary attention. The number of consumer cooperative shops has not yet reached the pre-war level, which is due to the fact that the trade network in previously occupied areas has not yet been fully restored. The Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic has only 88.3% of the pre-war level, the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic has only 80.4%, and the Smolensk region has only 82%.

The All-Union Central Consumer Cooperative should take measures to eliminate the backwardness in the development of retail trade in rural areas in the next two to three years. To supplement the fixed trade network, it is necessary to organize thousands of mobile shops to serve small settlements according to a strict schedule.

Collective farm trade is an important part of Soviet trade. All conditions have been created to further develop this form of trade. However, trade workers in various places rarely help collective farms and collective farmers in organizing the sale of surplus agricultural products, and the leadership of collective farm markets is also poor.

Our country has a large number of collective farm markets. By January 1, 1953, there were 8,474 markets in the entire Soviet Union, of which 4,100 were in cities and 4,374 were in rural areas. Collective farms and collective farmers transport a large amount of grain to the market for sale every year. In many large cities, covered collective farm markets have been established. Now we have many markets with very good equipment. However, the situation of collective farm markets cannot be considered satisfactory.

Half of the urban markets still do not have warehouses and cold storage for storing goods transported by collective farms and collective farmers. About 1,500 urban markets still do not have meat and dairy inspection stations. Urban markets with paved floors and asphalt only account for 36.2% of the total area.

Many examples of poor work in urban markets can be found, but the situation of many rural markets being neglected is even more serious.

What tasks need to be solved in the field of collective farm trade to make this trade advance greatly?

The workers of collective farm markets and local trade authorities should take emergency measures to create favorable conditions for collective farms and collective farmers to sell surplus agricultural products in the market.

Each district, region, territory, and republic should draft and implement measures to improve collective farm markets in 1954; all urban markets should complete the work of paving floors or asphalt within the next two to three years.

In the market and the streets near the market, the trade of industrial goods needed by collective farms and collective farmers should be developed, especially production and household goods; consumer cooperative workers should continuously accept the commission of collective farms and collective farmers to sell agricultural products.

Everyone knows that when farmers are busy with field work, the transportation of products to the market will inevitably decrease.

If, in addition to collective farmers selling their own products, cooperatives accept the commission of collective farms and collective farmers to organize the sale of agricultural products according to the principle of commissioned sales, then there will be no such decrease in the transportation of agricultural products to the market during the busy farming season.

At the same time, cooperatives can also guarantee that collective farmers obtain the income that can be obtained in the market, reduce the transportation costs of collective farmers, and avoid affecting the labor force during the farming season.

Cooperatives should prove to male and female collective farmers with facts the advantages of this form of trade.

Next, the workers of local Soviets, procurement organizations, machine-tractor stations, trade workers, and collective farm market workers should provide various assistance to collective farms and collective farmers in transporting agricultural products to collective farm markets.

For this purpose, it is necessary to use the idle transportation vehicles of machine-tractor stations, procurement organizations, consumer cooperatives, automobile transportation, and local organizations of the road department. First of all, use the idle trucks.

There are a large number of trucks coming to the city to pick up goods. Why can't these trucks be organized to transport collective farmers to the market?

The government has ordered relevant departments and authorities to provide various assistance in the transportation of surplus agricultural products by collective farms and collective farmers to collective farm markets.

Similarly, it is necessary to ensure the reasonable collection of new market taxes (this tax has been reduced by 30% since October 1 of this year) and new market service fees (this fee has been reduced by 65%), to promote the development of collective farm trade.

Comrades! The All-Union Conference of Trade Workers convened according to the resolution of the government is meeting at a turning point in the development of trade.

The resolution passed by the Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on expanding food production and expanding the production of daily necessities and improving their quality, as well as the resolution on further developing the measures of Soviet trade, is a great program of the state to ensure the rapid increase of consumer goods for the people, a great program to prosper Soviet trade.

I believe that the army of Soviet trade workers, inspired by these historic resolutions, will surely exert their strength, energy, and talents, with the assistance and support of local Soviets and Party organizations, to honorably and competently undertake the great task of vigorously developing and prospering Soviet trade.

    关于进一步发展商品流转及改善国营、合作社和集体农庄贸易的措施
    ——一九五三年十月十七日在苏联全国贸易工作者代表会议上的报告
    苏联贸易部部长　阿·伊·米高扬
    同志们，我们的会议是在一个有重大意义的时候举行的。
    现在所有的人，无论在城市和乡村都感觉到和了解到，我们的国家是处在向共产主义前进的新阶段，处在以前的社会主义建设全部进程已经准备好的新阶段。
    共产党和苏维埃国家最关心的和最重要的任务，永远是不间断地、经常地提高人民的生活水平，尽可能在每一个阶段更充分地满足他们的物质和文化的需要。
    十月革命以来，我们的国家已经走过了艰巨的途程；我国接受的遗产是沉重的：不发达的落后的工业，落后的农业，绝大多数的人民大众极低的消费水平，但是我国却迅速地发展了它的经济，而发展的速度是任何一个国家在其任何一个发展时期所没有过的。
    而且，不能不估计到的是，苏维埃政权在我国建立的三十五年中，约有十五年是处于战争的年代中和经过帝国主义战争、国内战争以及伟大的卫国战争之后恢复国民经济的年代中。
    自一九二四—一九二五年，即经济恢复接近一九一三年水平时起，到一九五三年为止，在这差不多三十年的期间，工业产量增加为二十九倍，其中百分之七十以上是生产资料。仅在最近十二年中，即自一九四○年至一九五二年，苏联工业产量就已增加为二点三倍，虽然在这一时期发生了卫国战争，严重地影响了我们的国民经济。
    现在，已经不仅是我们的国外友人，而且许多决不能算作友人的人也开始清醒地观察事实了，他们对我们经济发展的胜利，已经不再保持缄默，而承认我们计划的现实性，虽然他们为了自己的侵略目的，利用有关我们和平建设成就的资料，企图以苏联经济的成就来恫吓人们。
    例如，美国负责经济事务的助理国务卿华霍，今年七月在伊利诺斯大学发表演说时说：“苏联在战争结束后，在经济领域内取得了令人不安的显著成就。……的确，这是非常迅速的发展速度……如果这种发展速度继续保持下去，那么到一九六○年左右，苏联的经济力量极可能将等于并超过西欧的经济力量。这并不是值得特别高兴的情况，这是我们应该时时牢记在心的一种因素。”
    与这些人物的恫吓相反，世界上普通的人们并不害怕我们的成就，因为他们认为我们所作的全部努力是向着一个目标——使国家粮食丰裕，使工业品富裕，建设共产主义社会。
    应该说，国家的工业化，重工业的迅速发展，是社会主义的物质基础，实现了这些，归根结底，就是为了创造条件使我们人民的物质福利达到历史上空前未有的迅速高涨。但在一定的时期内我们曾不得不对消费作一定的限制，以解决经济建设的首要任务。这是由于以前我们从来没有像现在所拥有的这样巨大的可能性。
    现在，我们可以一面继续以高速度发展重工业，一面更快地向前发展消费品的生产。
    关于这些以及其他刻不容缓的问题，马林科夫同志在苏联最高苏维埃第五次会议的演说中曾经谈到过，马林科夫同志的演说是苏联政府纲领性的声明，它规定了我们今后的经济任务。其中注意到，为了保证消费品生产的显著的高涨，首先应该设法进一步发展并提高供应居民以粮食和供应轻工业与食品工业以原料的农业。
    根据公布的材料，大家都知道，今年九月初党中央委员会召开了全体会议，听取了赫鲁晓夫同志关于进一步发展苏联农业的措施的报告，并对这个问题作出了决议，这个决议对于我们国家的发展是具有历史意义的。
    在报告中和在苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议的决议中，对于我国农业，特别是饲畜业的当前情况作了真实而毫无粉饰的估计。它们表明，饲畜业和农业已有的成绩不能让我们满意，集体农庄制度的极其丰富的潜在力还未加以充分利用。
    全体会议在农业方面所制定的措施，并不是暂时的措施而是根本的措施。这正是我们党的经济政策的基本环节，掌握了这个环节，就能够而且一定会实现我们整个经济的迅速的新高涨，大大提高工人阶级、集体农民、全体人民的生活水平，更进一步加强社会主义城市和集体农庄间的联盟，这个联盟是反对资本主义的坚强堡垒，是向共产主义胜利前进的强有力的基础。
    大家知道，全体会议特别注意饲畜业的现状及其进一步发展的措施，因为它对于扩大生产有价值的食品——肉类和肉类制品、乳类和油类，对于居民的供应，具有重要意义。
    增加马铃薯和蔬菜生产的问题，也是迫切的问题。马铃薯和蔬菜的需要量增长了，以致使现有生产水平完全不能满足这个要求。于是党中央委员会全体会议批准了改善这种情况的措施，提高了收购价格，减低了对国家的义务交售标准，增加了按照限价购买马铃薯和蔬菜的份额。
    全体会议规定了完成一切耕作全盘机械化的任务和饲畜业机械化的任务。
    苏共中央九月全体会议的决议为我们大力提高人民大众的物质福利，开辟了广阔的前景。这个决议可以消除领导农业方面的一些重大缺点，它可以消除国民经济中某些部门发展水平和速度的某种不平衡的状况，特别是消灭饲畜业和蔬菜种植落后于国民经济和人民需要的状况，这一点，赫鲁晓夫同志在他的报告中已经解释得很清楚了。这个发展方向是符合社会主义经济按比例发展的法则的。
    由此可见，这一系列的措施一方面创造了扩大消费品生产的条件，另一方面也创造了使人民购买力相应地进一步提高的条件。
    这就是我国经济对资本主义经济的根本优越性之一。许多资本主义国家本来可以增加商品的生产，甚至有增加商品生产的生产能力，但是它们不得不缩减生产，有时甚至使生产停顿，关闭工厂，这是因为劳动人民遭受的剥削日甚一日，一天比一天贫穷，因而买东西的钱越来越少了。
    而在我们这里，恰恰相反，需求的增加推进了生产，生产的发展又决定了消费量的提高，创造了需求，使得有可能减低价格，增加城市和乡村的收入，从而提高劳动人民的购买力。
    大力增加消费品的生产
    在我们社会主义国家，劳动产品完全是为了满足社会的需要或社会成员个人的需要。因此，大力增加居民的消费品的生产，也就是急剧提高劳动人民的物质福利。
    在生产量与消费量大大增加的条件下，我们暂时还消除不了消费品的生产和苏联人民大众日益增长的需求量之间的一定程度的不平衡现象。我国消费品生产的急剧高涨，就是要消除这种不平衡的现象。
    下面的事实可以说明我们现在究竟有多么大的可能性来提高人民的福利。马林科夫同志在最高苏维埃第五次会议上的演说中说，一九五三年四月至十二月间，贸易部门将比原定在此期间应领到的三千一百二十亿卢布的货物多领三百二十亿的货物来供应居民。过了两个多月以后，苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会又设法多拨出了五十二亿卢布的货物以便向居民出售。这样，贸易部门将额外领到三百七十二亿卢布的货物来供应居民。这样看来，生产的急剧高涨今年已经开始了。
    布尔什维克是言行一致的。在过去数月中，政府已经采取了一系列的重要措施，以在今年就设法大力迅速提高人民大众的福利，首先是提高他们的购买力。
    第一，今年国营和合作社贸易消费品零售价格全年减低总额为四百六十亿卢布，而去年减低二百四十亿卢布。这就是说，居民的购买力单是由于这个来源就提高了二百二十亿卢布。
    第二，今年公债认购额比去年减少一百六十亿卢布。
    第三，农业税的减少和收购价格的提高以及对农业方面的其他措施，使农村居民今年可以获得一百三十亿卢布以上的额外收入。
    因此，仅凭以上所列举的措施，居民的购买力今年就进一步提高了数百亿卢布。苏联劳动人民物质福利以前所未有的速度增长着。
    苏联的商品流转额（按比较价格计算）在二十七年中（自一九二六年至一九五三年）几乎增加为八倍，而按人口计算，商品实物量每年增加百分之十点三，速度增为沙俄时代的三倍，尽管在这二十七年中有四年的伟大卫国战争。在沙俄时代，商品流转额在二十七年内（自一八八五年至一九一二年）增加为三倍，按人口计算商品实物量每年增加百分之三点五。
    在今年，仅零售商品流转额的增加数（按比较价格计算），就超过了沙俄时代一九一三年的全部零售商品流转总额。
    在人类历史上第一次在全民的和全国的规模上提出了这一任务：使人民的食品消费水平达到符合科学的营养标准，即符合社会主义社会健康的人全面和谐地发展所需要的营养标准。在这方面今年已经作了许多工作。
    仅一九五三年一年内售给苏联居民的食品就比一九五二年增加百分之二十二。国家卖给居民的肉和肉类制品的数量，在这一年内增加百分之四十二点四，动物油增加百分之四十四点八。
    一九五三年经由国营和合作社贸易机构卖给居民的动物油约为战前一九四○年的二点六倍，指出这一点不是没有意义的。
    如大家所看到的，供应的增长是巨大的，而人民的需求量增加得更快，所以在许多地方，肉类、腊肠、动物油和鱼类仍然感到缺乏。
    为了保证生产的急剧高涨和进一步迅速提高人民的物质福利，苏联部长会议和苏共中央委员会通过了扩大食品生产和改善其质量及品种的计划。
    一九五五年食品生产将比一九五○年增加百分之八十四点七，而第十九次党代表大会关于五年计划的指示中所规定的增加率为百分之七十一点四。这就是说，五年计划食品生产的任务将大大地超额完成。同时对于下一个五年计划的第一年即一九五六年规定了增加了的生产任务。
    这就是我国增加食品生产的巨大的三年计划！下面我举出一些最主要的食品增产的数字。
    一九五五年我国仅国营工业所生产的肉类将为二百五十多万吨，一九五六年——三百万吨；一九五五年的腊肠类——八十五万吨，一九五六年——一百万吨。
    一九五五年鱼的捕获量将为三千二百万公担左右，一九五六年——三千六百万公担。仅鲱鱼一种一九五六年的捕获量将近八百万公担。目前许多人都在抱怨鱼类和鱼类制品不足，他们说，近来鱼少了，而以前似乎较多。这不完全对，更恰当地说，简直就是不对。鱼是多了，但我们的需要比鱼的捕获量增加得更快。一九一三年沙俄时代的捕鱼量比现在少十二分之七。诚然，捕鱼的巨大计划现在还未完成，但是比战前是大大增加了。
    国营工业在一九五五年将生产牛油五十六万吨，一九五六年——六十五万吨。一九一三年沙俄的全部合标准的工业出产的动物油为十万零四千吨，其中一半是输出国外的。
    苏联动物油的生产，现在每年的增加数量约等于一九一三年的油类生产总额。但是应该说明，居民对于动物油的需求日增，而且由价值较低的油类转到价值更高的油类上。因此除增产外，最近我们同时还由国外输入了若干数量的这种油类。
    目前糖的生产约为革命前俄国的三倍，一九五六年将为四倍。
    现在点心的生产为一九一三年的二十倍。今后数年巧克力和巧克力制品的生产将特别显著地增加，一九五六年的产量将为一九四○年的十二倍，饼干类将增为三倍半。
    今后三年，其他食品的生产也将有巨大的增长。这就是使我国食品充裕的计划，这个计划是建设共产主义社会的前提之一。
    苏联部长会议和苏共中央委员会认为必须在今后两三年内加紧发展轻工业，并通过了扩大日用工业品生产并改进其质量的计划。
    因此在工业面前就提出了新的任务：大大提前完成五年计划为一九五五年所规定的消费品的生产任务并保证一九五六年生产的迅速增长，这样就为下一个五年计划中消费品生产的急剧高涨提供了前提。
    我国今后三年中日用工业品的生产约将增加百分之五十，而每增加百分之一现在是代表着比过去更大得多的绝对数量。
    不仅日用品工业部的企业扩大生产居民需要的物品，而且几乎所有各部，如航空、国防、冶金、机器制造各工业部的工厂也承担了额外生产消费品的很重的任务，这是那次通过的决议的重要特点。
    这样就使工业品生产的急剧增加这一问题能更迅速地解决，并使工业品的质量能显著改善。
     例如：一九五五年将生产：自行车——三百四十四万五千辆，其中机器制造工业部——二百七十万辆，国防工业部——五十万辆；收音机和电视机——四百五十二万七千部，其中电站和电机工业部——三百八十万部；电气冰箱——三十三万个，其中国防工业部——十一万个，航空工业部——九万个，机器制造工业部——六万个；铝制模压器皿——六万四千吨，其中航空工业部——三万五千吨；金属床——一千六百五十万架，其中航空工业部——四百二十万架，冶金工业部——三百九十万架，运输和重型机器制造工业部——一百万架，国防工业部——六十万架。
    一九五六年日用工业品的生产规定将要进一步增加。例如：一九五六年自行车将生产三百八十万辆，即为一九四○年的十四倍，钟表二千三百万只，约为一九四○年的九倍，收音机和电视机将生产五百四十万部（其中电视机为一百万部），而一九四○年生产的收音机为二十万部，电视机则未曾出产。
    下面的事实可以证明我们现在究竟有多么大的可能性来发展消费品的生产。一九五三年为制造消费品而分配的铝，比一九三七年全年全国所生产的多得多。这说明，我们现在是十分富足的，因而我们能拿出以前所不能拿出的这些数量的珍贵原料来生产日用品。
    同时还通过了关于改善其他许多消费品的质量和扩大其种类的措施。
    苏联部长会议和苏共中央委员会还批准了关于进一步改善铁路运输系统运输消费品的工作的措施。
    现在铁路运输应更好地为消费品的运输工作服务，注意市场的需要，考虑贸易的改善，而不仅照顾铁路工作人员的便利而已。今后应将把货物按甲类和乙类分类的办法取消，根据这种分类办法，一部分供应居民的货物常被列为乙类。并且扩大了铁路站长的职权，因而也同时扩大了各地方贸易机关在计划消费品运输方面的权限和可能性。
    在主要的铁路干线上应采用加速的货物列车。为了保证食品和工业品能由中途各站及时发出，在许多路段上规定实行解结列车和混合车辆定期行驶的制度。
    广泛建设仓库、车站货栈、装卸月台，这对贸易将有很大的帮助。
    这个决议同样加给贸易工作人员一个重责。由于贸易机构的疏忽而使车辆停歇的现象是不能容忍的。应精确准时地执行对运输部门承担的义务。
    现阶段苏维埃贸易的作用和任务
    如不广泛提高苏维埃贸易的效率，消费水平的急剧高涨是不会实现的。苏维埃贸易是我们社会主义社会分配消费品的基本方法。
    正如马林科夫同志在最高苏维埃第五次会议演说中所说，社会主义制度下的贸易现在是而且在今后很长的时期内仍然是满足劳动人民个人日益增长的需要的主要形式。苏维埃贸易的使命是根据社会主义经济法则的要求，不间断地将社会主义工业和农业的产品送到居民手里。
    在我国发生作用的国民经济有计划、按比例发展的法则，要求有意识地和有组织地把生产和消费配合起来。由于我国经济是有计划的，我们可以不走弯路而直接计算需求量并根据需求量发展生产。我们制度的最大优越性就表现在这里。而由此也产生了贸易机构的艰巨责任，因为工作的成功完全系于我们本身，系于我们的组织性和才干。
    在贸易机构中，还有巨大的缺点阻碍着进一步发展贸易和改善对居民的服务。贸易机构不善于研究居民的需要，而在商品分配和运输方面发生严重错误。
    贸易工作人员的任务，是研究居民的需要并积极影响生产，同时为消费者的利益而争取按照居民所需要的种类生产消费品。如果贸易机构不去影响工业，不维护购买人的利益，那么这就等于它们不再考虑苏维埃贸易的基本原则了。
    贸易对居民的需求不应该是被动的。苏维埃贸易的使命是以前进的精神积极影响需求。它应该培养消费者的口味，介绍居民采用新货，宣传最有营养和可以增进健康的食品，宣传适用的、质量好的、美观的、可以使劳动人民的日常生活和文化生活更加美满的工业品。
    现在，由于消费品生产的新的有力的高涨，苏维埃贸易的作用就更加增大了。贸易机构应精确地、灵活地推销迅速增长的大批的商品，不允许在商品推销中有任何阻塞现象，以便在今后两三年内，在每个城市和每个农业地区都能买到所有的必需品。
    苏维埃贸易在进一步发展社会主义工业和集体农庄的经济联系上，在进一步加强工人阶级和农民的联盟上，在提高集体农庄生产上，作用是巨大的。贸易机构的义务是彻底执行列宁的指示：“国家必须学会经商，使工业满足农民，使农民通过贸易满足自己的需要。”（列宁全集俄文版第三十三卷，第五○页）
    伟大的列宁关于“学会经商”的号召，在现在情况下对我们仍然有效。当我们过渡到新经济政策的时候，我们还不曾有任何的贸易经验，也没有自己的贸易干部。我们以前从贸易的起码知识学起，在与私商进行竞争与斗争中学会了贸易。
    现在，在社会主义胜利了的条件下，苏维埃贸易进入了新的、更高的发展阶段；积累了丰富的经验，建立和培养了苏维埃贸易工作者的百万大军。货物资源大量地增加了。现在贸易已经不是以往的贸易了，贸易工作人员已经远不是以往的贸易工作人员了。然而，应该坦率地承认，贸易是落后于迅速增长着的人民的要求的。
    我们应该培养年轻的贸易工作人员的文化修养，以知识武装他们，提高他们的熟练程度。必须提高所有贸易工作人员的水平，使之符合苏维埃贸易的当前任务的要求，培养他们敏感，仔细地对待消费者的要求，以殷勤周到的态度对待顾客。
    苏维埃贸易是社会主义的分配方法。社会主义社会的贸易是有史以来第一次为人民服务的贸易。为了实现在我们国家建设共产主义社会的宏伟纲领，我们应以最大决心开展苏维埃贸易，彻底利用其所有的潜力，创造将来实行共产主义分配原则的条件。
    我们经济建设三十多年的经验充分明显地证明了苏维埃贸易对资本主义贸易的巨大优越性。我国社会主义贸易的根本优越的地方在于：它的目的是为人及其需要服务，是为了最充分地满足苏联人的需求。与此完全相反，资本主义贸易的动机在于追求最大限度的利润，而消费者只是资本家和投机商人最肆无忌惮地掠夺的对象而已。
    在资产阶级国家，贸易停滞不前和周期性下降，这是广大居民日益贫困的后果。
    在一九二八年至一九四○年的时期内，苏联商品流转额增加为二点三倍（按比较价格计算）。在同一时期内资本主义国家的商品流转额不仅没有增加，而且在第二次世界大战前夕甚至低于一九二九年的水平。
    战后年代，两条发展路线的对比表现得同样明显——我国贸易迅速高涨和资本主义国家贸易停滞不前。美国一九五二年商品流转额停留在一九五○年的水平上，而英国甚至有某些降低。苏联一九四九—一九五二年零售商品流转额（按比较价格计算）增加为两倍。
    美国和英国有人还自夸他们在市场上有很多消费品。但是，在资产阶级国家内，商店有很多货物，而人民大众却无力购买，那对他们又有什么好处呢！今天他们的情形比一九二九年更坏了，更不用提起第一次世界大战前西欧居民回忆中的“黄金时代”那些年代了。现在资本主义国家发展的规律是这样的：它们是难以改变地走下坡路，向消费品生产更低的水平走。
    我们是另外一种规律，在苏维埃政权的年代中，我们前进了很远。我们的生产、商品流转和消费是有计划地发展的，它们发展的速度甚至在资产阶级国家最好的时期内也不曾有过。不错，当我们还是落后和贫困的国家时，这些国家就早已达到了比较高的发展水平，然而几十年来却停滞不前，甚至倒退，难道能以此而夸耀吗？只有估计到我们的和他们的发展趋势，才能对成就作出正确的估价。毫无疑义，我们既然顺利地解决了重工业发展的任务，也可以同样迅速地发展消费品的生产，并且在这方面，我们也将成为最富足的国家，保证人民有最高的生活水平。而且与国家财富不属于人民的资本主义经济制度的国家不同，我们是力求保证全民消费的最高水平并且在发展生产中时时考虑到根据科学的要求改善消费品的构成。
    只有在社会主义社会才能有合理地组织起来的贸易，这种贸易的流转费既很低，又能真正关心消费者的利益。随着苏维埃贸易的发展，流转费也就是商品由生产达到消费者手中的费用也不断降低。苏联政府为了将这些费用减低到最低限度，表现了不倦的关心。减低工业品的成本和贸易中的流转费，是经常减低价格的主要泉源。根据苏联一九五一—一九五五年发展国民经济五年计划，我们应该减低贸易流转费百分之二十三。在进一步减低流转费方面，我们有极大的可能性，其办法有：
    第一，经常发掘和尽量利用内部经济潜力，厉行节约，并不断改善对消费者的服务；
    第二，消灭损失，商品质量不得降低，不得有所损坏，消灭不合理的运输并保证商品不间断地运往贸易机构，大力扩展定量包装货物和计件货物的销售工作；以现代贸易设备和商店内部运输工具来装备商店；
    第三，减低贸易过程中的费用，更合理地组织商品供应，消灭多余环节和减低贸易管理机构费用。
    我国国营和合作社贸易最大的优点之一，就是它是根据固定价格进行的，而固定价格则是不断地降低。我国一贯地降低物价，是苏联政府的政策的不可动摇的原则，其目的是增加人民的购买力和使我国社会每一成员有进一步提高物质福利水平的可能。
    我们甚至减低目前数量还不充足的商品的价格，如果这些商品对广大消费者具有重要意义的话。应当说明，这样就会引起更多的需求，并将推动我们更迅速地增加市场上缺乏的和居民必需的商品的生产。
    一九四七年以来，我国减低了六次物价，因而价格的总水平降低了一半以上，苏联卢布的购买力增加为两倍多。居民得到很多利益。
    与此相反，资本主义国家的贸易，其价格是自流的，资本家和投机商人不放过任何小的机会使物价上涨，靠劳动人民的饥饿和贫困来发财致富。战后，在所有的资本主义国家中，物价是投机式地飞涨，因而劳动人民的消费和生活水平更加低落。
    苏联自一九四七年以来，面包、肉类和油类的价格降低三分之二，而在法国，这些物品的价格则增加为两倍，在英国，面包价格约提高为二倍，肉类为一点五倍，油类为二点五倍。在美国，这些物品价格同样上涨了，不过稍微少些而已。
    在我们苏维埃贸易中没有商人的气味。贸易工作人员应严格遵守规定的价格，对这种价格的任何破坏都被看成是罪行，苏维埃法律是严格地保护消费者的利益的。
    在这方面，国家贸易检查局起着巨大的作用。国家贸易检查局是代表国家进行监督的全权代表，它应该与破坏规定价格的企图进行坚决的斗争，与欺骗顾客的行为进行坚决的斗争，并采取措施来防止这类的破坏。
    工会的公共监督也具有重要的意义。当劳动群众也参加监督时，这种监督就成为巨大的社会力量了。贸易机构领导人的责任是尽力利用这种监督来改进贸易业务，协助并推动检查员的工作。
    对于售给居民的货物质量的全面检查，是苏联政府不倦关心人民福利和健康的表现之一。
    在苏维埃政权的年代里，建立了国家检查商品质量的完整系统，根据科学的方法在专门实验室中对质量进行检查，对工业企业、贸易机构和公共饮食企业，组织卫生检查。像食品质量检查局和日用工业品质量检查局这些机构的活动，在检查工作中具有头等意义。这些检查局以前隶属于各工业部，现在已拨归贸易部管辖，这对贸易是新的巨大的帮助，并使得提高消费品质量的斗争更容易进行。
    我们力求使无论是贵重的还是低廉的商品，都毫无例外地品质优良。旧商人的尺度“贵的是好的，贱的是坏的”，不是我们的尺度。
    在“不欺骗，就不出卖”这一狼心狗肺法则支配下的资本主义贸易中，广泛推销腐坏的和伪造的制品。如果推销腐坏的和有害的货物，可以给资本家带来利润的话，那他们就不管人们的健康了。
    苏维埃国家建立了符合社会主义社会需要的免除资本主义贸易恶习和毒害的新型贸易。
  我们有标准的贸易企业：为其他国家所羡慕的食品店、百货店、专业商店。现在的任务是：要将我们所有的贸易机构都提高到上述商店的水平。
    应该注意的是，在竞争的条件下，在销售困难日增的情况下，就是资产阶级国家在贸易企业组织方面，在贸易技术方面，在为顾客、特别是为有钱顾客服务方面，都树立一些不坏的榜样。
    有些同志藉口反对崇拜外国，竟忽视外国的经验，不注意外国的经验，不研究它们，不利用它们对我们有用的东西，这些同志是不能不受到申斥的。
    我们一面广泛地推广我们好的贸易企业的先进经验，一面也要学习资产阶级国家较好的企业，利用它们在进行贸易和对顾客服务的工作中对我们有用的东西，不要藐视运用这种有益的经验，而要为了广大群众的利益应用这种经验。
    我们的任务是，坚决地揭发和消灭我们贸易中现存的缺点，努力按照苏联政府和共产党的要求改进贸易工作，把贸易工作提高到配得上社会主义社会劳动者的水平。
    商品流转额的增长
    我们社会主义建设的巨大成就，工业品及农产品的增长和人民购买力的不断提高，也保证了我国零售商品流转额的增长。
    一九五三年国营贸易与合作社贸易的零售商品流转额比一九四○年增加了百分之七十九（按比较价格计算）。过去的三年中商品流转额每年平均增长百分之十三（按比较价格计算），而一九五三年比一九五二年就增长了百分之二十。
    商品流转的结构正在大大改善中。战前一九四○年工业品在国内商品流转额中占百分之三十六点九，而一九五三年则占百分之四十五点三。
    同时必须谈谈本年度商品流转计划的执行情况。第一季度在完成计划上显著地落后了，只完成了百分之九十四点九。本年第二、第三两季度的商品流转计划虽然算是完成了，但还未能完全弥补第一季度里的未完成额，并且也未能完成商品流转的追加任务。
    直到现在我们还有些州和共和国，它们的贸易机构没有很好地完成计划。举例说，斯维德洛夫斯克市的贸易机构（市贸易局局长为布伯诺夫同志）在一九五三年头九个月中商品流转计划只完成了百分之九十六点五；车里雅宾斯克州的贸易机构（州贸易局局长为吴斯金诺夫同志）只完成百分之九十七点一；伏罗希洛夫格勒州的贸易机构（州贸易局局长为沃尔科夫同志）只完成百分之九十六点九。政府在一九五三年第二、第三季度里所采取的关于增加市场货物总量的措施，及居民现金收入的进一步增加，已经为超额完成一九五三年商品流转计划创造了一切条件。
    现在贸易工作人员的任务是：超额完成一九五三年第四季度的商品流转计划，从而超额完成全年计划，并保证完成商品流转的追加任务。
    现在简单谈谈消费品的进口情况。最近几年来我们开始利用这个补充来源供应居民。我们现在是更富裕了，因而可以输入大米、橘柑类水果，香蕉，菠萝，鲱鱼等食品以及上等毛织品，丝织品，家具等工业品及其他一些花样翻新的货物。这些货物在居民中销路很好。
    我们在今年总计从国外购买消费品四十亿卢布，其中三分之二的数额是由人民民主国家输入的。我们也往国外输出一些我们大量拥有的消费品，并用某一些货物来援助人民民主国家。
    为了保证苏维埃贸易的急剧高涨，部长会议及共产党中央委员会最近通过了关于进一步发展苏联贸易的措施这一极其重要的决议，这个决议是我们今后三年的行动纲领；这样迅速地提高苏维埃贸易的纲领我们是从未有过的。
    苏联部长会议和我们党中央委员会认为，在一九五四年必须把国营及合作社贸易的零售商品流转额比一九五○年增加百分之七十二（按比较价格计算），而五年计划中规定一九五五年增加百分之七十，也就是说五年计划中给一九五五年所规定的任务，在一九五四年就已经提前完成了。而一九五五年的零售商品流转额约增加为一九五○年的两倍。
    有些人问什么叫作贸易急剧高涨？商品流转额的这样增长就意味着贸易的急剧高涨。
    一九五五年卖给居民的食品及工业品将比五年计划里所规定的任务大大增加，关于这一点由下列的材料中可以得到证明：
    一九五五年市场商品总量与一九五○年比较增加如下：
              五年计划规定  新任务
    肉类制品　一点九倍　        二点三倍
    鱼类制品　一点七倍　        二点一倍
    动物油　  一点七倍　        一点九倍
    植物油　  二倍            　二点六倍
    糖　      二倍            　二点三倍
    衣服　    一点八倍        　二点四倍
    纺织品　  一点七倍　        一点八倍
          其中毛织品和丝织品　  二点四倍
    家具　    三倍　            四倍
    金属器皿　二点五倍　        四点九倍
    缝纫机  　二点四倍        　五点一倍
    自行车　  三点五倍        　五点五倍
    收音机及电视机　两倍　      四点四倍
    钟表    　二点二倍　        二点六倍
    许多其他货物的市场总量也有增加。
    苏联部长会议及苏联共产党中央委员会认为，一九五六年主要食品及工业品的市场总量必须比一九五○年大量增加，各种货物分别增加为：
    肉类制品二点六倍，鱼类制品二点三倍，动物油二点一倍，植物油二点八倍，糖二点四倍，纺织品及鞋二倍，缝纫机五点九倍，自行车六倍，收音机及电视机五点三倍，家具四点八倍。
    在这个决议里解决了改善食品及工业品贸易的重大问题，解决了研究居民对商品的需要的重大问题，并拟定大大增加贸易的物质技术基础及其他关于发展苏维埃贸易的重要措施。
    现在贸易方面的任务是：要认真地把发展苏维埃贸易事业向前推进一步，并在今后两三年内在每个城市及农业地区保证不间断地供应居民一切必需品。
    食品贸易的特点是，极其贵重的食品的销售量大大增加了。
    一九五三年上半年莫斯科肉类消费量增加为一九五○年上半年的两倍，列宁格勒增加为一点九倍，莫洛托夫增加为二点二倍，斯维德洛夫斯克增加为一点九倍，车里雅宾斯克增加为二点五倍。在其他城市中增加较少一些，但同样也有很大的增加。
    一九五三年动物油的销售量将比一九五二年多十万零八千吨。一九五三年糖的销售量将比一九五二年多六十万吨。
    伊凡诺佛纺织工人（谢列德斯克纺织厂）在一九○九年按人口计算每人在一年中消费十二点八公斤的糖，而苏联纺织工人在一九五二年按全国平均计算则消费三十一点二公斤，而在一九五三年这个数字将突破三十五公斤。可以看到，糖的消费量增加为两倍多。
    应该说，我们的糖仍然不是在所有地区里都是够用的，往往有人抱怨：有块糖而无沙糖，或者有沙糖而无块糖。
    这是工业及贸易经营人员的组织工作的疏忽大意所造成的。
    葡萄酒的消费量也有迅速的增长，与一九四○年相比，目前的消费量增加为一点八倍。这是由于居民购买力在颇大程度上提高了。香槟酒现在由奢侈品变成为我国劳动者所享受的物品，这也标志着普遍的幸福。
    满足苏联消费者对上等食品的需求，应该是工业及贸易的准则。
    苏联贸易工作人员应根据顾客的需求向工业提出关于扩大食品的种类及提高品质的要求，从而影响工业。
      食品工业制造居民所爱好的一些食品还是不够，如：小腊肠，肉饼，饺子，腊肠及肉类半制成品；如：改善了的包装糖果：“透明糖果”，“虾头”，“鹅爪”，“天鹅”，“歪脚熊”，胡桃糖果及莓果糖果。
    食品工业应大量增加定量包装物品，包装要坚实美观。
    同样必须保证在所有商店里出售所谓附带的货物（例如：在食品店出售醋、芥茉、辣子等），罐头店应带销罐头启子、刀子；酒店带销穿孔器、拔塞钻等。看起来这是小事，但凡是为顾客所需要的，就不算什么小事了。
    在马铃薯和蔬菜贸易中有许多严重缺点，这些缺点将使这些极重要食品对居民的供应工作做得不能令人满意。运入城市及工业中心的马铃薯和蔬菜销售得不均衡。大部分马铃薯和蔬菜在八月——十二月这一阶段就销售完了，而一月——二月份供应工作就形成了严重的中断情况，因此必须注意到建筑马铃薯和蔬菜的储藏库，妥善保管马铃薯和蔬菜，以便在整个冬季及春季不间断地出售。
    今年曾采取措施大量增加西瓜和香瓜的销售量，这在相当程度上补偿了水果的缺乏。今年两个月中在城市中售出由国家分配的四十五万三千吨西瓜和香瓜，一九五二年全年才售出二十三万四千吨。
    现在执行的提高园艺业的措施并不能那样快地见效。因此，现在的任务就是：充分利用现有的巨大潜力来增加西瓜和香瓜的产量，以便在一九五四年以这些瓜类充分供应市场。
    我国居民近几年来对品质经过改良了的面包类的需要增加了，对由优良小麦粉所制的面包类的需要增加得特别多，因而普通面包的消费量很显著地日渐减少。例如，莫斯科市在战前上等面包平均每昼夜售出七十万到八十万个，现在售出二百三十万个；在顿巴斯，长面包及小面包的销售量增为一九四○年的十倍，在乌拉尔则增为六倍。
    今后的任务是：用优良小麦粉制成的改良的论个面包的产量到一九五六年达到百分之七十五，战前这种面包只生产百分之二十；由裸麦粉制成的论个面包达到百分之四十，战前这种论个的面包差不多还没有生产过。
    与今年十月改进面包种类的同时，还实行了许多关于今后提高面包及面粉营养价值和品质的措施。由于提高了炭水化合物，有益的矿物盐质和蛋白质的含量，面包的含热量将大大提高。要保证面粉磨制得更精细，以使由这类面粉烤制出来的面包更容易消化。
    可惜，还得指出的是：我们还未能铲除这种现象，即烤制出不合规格的面包，如水分及酸性过高，未烤熟和烧焦的面包。为了保证面包制品的不同的种类，我们政府最近批准了关于今后发展面包制造工业，改进品质、种类及面包贸易的巨大计划。
    几十年来食品工业部系统内建成了约八百个面包制造厂和一千一百个机械化的面包制造厂，而今后三年内要增建三百七十二个面包制造企业，配备以新式设备，使制造过程全部机械化。
    由于面包业和点心业的疏忽，很多城市居民对甜点心，大圆蛋糕和饼干的需求不能满足。因此，拟定并批准了在面包制造厂内建设二百个专门生产这种制品的点心车间的计划。
    除改善面包和面粉品质的措施外，应补充关于改善面包输送及保管的措施。在很多城市里，面包输送和保管不当，杂乱堆积，没有遵守必要的卫生要求，对面包的装卸粗枝大叶，因而在许多情况下使面包品质变坏。由于这些原因，到消费者手中的面包往往品质降低，揉坏了和失掉物品的原形。
    必须效法莫斯科、列宁格勒及其他大城市的办法，全国所有城市改用专门运输工具运输面包，这个工作要在一九五五年完成。
    一九五三年日用工业品销售量比战前时期急剧增加了。
  一九五三年售出的毛织品和丝织品增加为一九四○年五点三倍，服装增加为二点一倍，自行车增加为六倍，而机器脚踏车增加为一百倍，但还不够。小汽车在一九五三年的销售量将增为一九五○年的一点九倍，而在战前私用汽车就没有出售过。据说，现在登记购买汽车的人，要等待半年以后才能买到。这些特殊的困难与我们已往的那些困难是不相同的。
    本年度所售出的工业品大大增加了。今年纺织品、服装、鞋、针织物、袜子和短袜等的销售量约为二百一十亿卢布，即比一九五二年多百分之二十三点五。
    但仍未能满足居民对某些工业品的需求。我们缺乏斑烂色及杂色的纺织品、细绒、衬里及衬衣布，并缺乏人造丝制成的缝纫品，如：服装、大衣、男衬衫、女绸衫等。
    货物不能均衡地按期发送；对颜色、花样、尺码、式样不加选分；贸易机构的订货往往被破坏。例如，明斯克工业品贸易公司为一九五三年订购了三十七种花样的印花布，而在第一季度里从莫斯科拨货站只收到三种花样的印花布；缎子应为十五种花样但只收到了一种。纺织品贸易总管理局喀山贸易站在第二季度里供给鞑靼苏维埃社会主义自治共和国市贸易机构棉织衬衣，为订货的百分之一百三十八，而缎子为百分之八十五，夏季衣料为百分之八十五点二。
    贸易机构和商店对货物的尺码、身量、流行式样的挑选工作进行得松懈。某些种类、尺码、式样、颜色的货物，贸易站及仓库虽有存货，但商店竟有脱销情况。苏联政府为了尽量满足居民对建筑材料日益增长的需要，在本年对城市和乡村所拨出的零售建筑材料，与去年拨作贸易用的建筑材料的数量比较增为两倍半。
    与一九五二年比较，一九五三年对居民和集体农庄的建筑材料销售量将增加如下：成材和锯材增为三倍，石板二点五倍，建筑用钉子、铁条、屋顶毡、水泥一点八倍，以及大量的干漆、铅粉、装饰板、干灰泥和窗用玻璃。
    从今年起开始出售个人建筑用的预装配的标准房屋。由于居民储金增长，使他们有可能利用这些钱在城市和乡村建筑私人房屋和别墅。
    自一九五四年起在莫斯科、列宁格勒及许多其他城市里，将更广泛出售各种类型的标准房屋，并将接受居民对它们的订货。
    研究居民的需要，争取提高商品质量
    大家知道，苏联贸易的本质决定了必须全面来研究居民的需要和他们的所有各种各样的需求。只有在这个基础上才能保证对国内各地区正确地调拨货物资源。
    对于居民对货物的需求研究得不能令人满意，这是贸易中最大的缺点，这个缺点会成为苏维埃贸易进一步发展的整个事业中的严重阻碍。应该坦白地说，贸易工作人员对居民的需要研究得还不好，这样就会造成对州、边疆区和共和国调拨货物计划上的严重错误。
    在如高尔基市这样大的工业中心，研究顾客的购买需要只在一个商店里进行。在喀山市，对顾客需要的研究工作，只安排在百货公司和两个市工业品贸易公司商店里。有许多贸易机构研究居民的需要，仅限于填写表格和报告书，而这些表报差不多根本没有人去研究，而且在业务工作中也很少利用。来自各地关于研究居民需要的报告，在百货总公司里不加以分析，也不加以总结，除极少的情况外，实际上都没采用。
    向国内各地区调拨的货物及向贸易机构供给的货物，直到现在还是按照与供货单位“商定”的种类。由于对市场情况与对国内各地区居民所需要的商品种类研究得不好，因此在协商选类时就犯了一些错误。生活的要求大大改变了，而协商的种类还是老样。因此，实际上协商的种类往往成为强迫销售的种类。
    按现行供货的基本条件，贸易机构应依照协商的种类选择货物。如果贸易机构不采用“商定”的种类中的货物，就不能以该地区居民所需要的其他商品代替。这种办法可能对销售站的懒惰工作人员很方便，但是这只给贸易带来损害。
    在纺织品贸易总公司贸易销售站经理会议上，提出很多事实，证明货物调拨不正确，把货物强迫交付给贸易机构，研究居民需求的工作做得不能令人满意。结果，只有对个别地区的调拨货物计划加以重大修正。
    一九五三年曾数次提出改变产品种类的计划，但贸易部把这些计划提出过晚了，当时在仓库和销售站里已经积压了过多的销路不好的货物。
    研究居民需求的现行制度执行得过于集中——大量材料过分地集中到贸易部，甚至不必要的材料，都会到中央来。在协商供应居民需求的某些货物方面，应该赋予地方机关以更多的权限。
    批发和零售贸易机构都应研究城市和乡村居民的需求。应尽力鼓励举行顾客会议这一经验，提倡采纳公民的建议，组织各种商品展览会、货物分类展览室并利用报刊进行宣传等。
    在研究及更充分地满足居民需要方面，商品鉴定员的作用和意义是特别巨大的。谁也不能像熟练的商品鉴定员一样来正确地鉴定从工业部门收到的商品，其种类和品质是否合乎顾客的要求与爱好。
    但是我们这里，商品鉴定员的意义是降低了，我认为，正如总工程师在工厂仅次于经理一样，在贸易机构中商品鉴定员应为检查商品种类和品质的第二人。从今以后在贸易上应提高他的作用，这样，品质和分类的问题将更能顺利地解决。
    我们党和政府始终毫不松懈地注意着提高产品的质量问题。贸易机构负有重大责任只将质量好的货物送到消费者面前。贸易工作人员每天在自己工作中接触千百万的苏联顾客，售货员最先听到顾客对售出的货物的意见。
    贸易工作人员对所售出的货物在顾客面前直接负责。他们必须反映顾客的利益，并在工业部门面前，在货物的种类和质量方面维护顾客的利益，不允许有不合乎规格的商品进入贸易机构。
    贸易机构有一切可能利用经济杠杆争取改善商品质量及种类。贸易工作人员有责任要求工业部门生产新的商品，他们应该成为新商品的推销者，经常推动工业部门生产为居民所要求的优良的商品。
    为了改善商品质量，政府责成轻工业部增产质量优良的毛织品，如“波士顿”牌、“地下铁道”牌、“力士”牌、“突击队员”牌、呢子和厚呢子、“首都”牌及其他；改善丝织品的修饰，提高其坚固性，增加生产印花纺织品，设法使人造丝织品减少收缩性，并改善纺织品的美术装饰。
    计划大量增加生产为消费者所爱好的人造纤维织品。莫斯科第一印花布工厂和三山纺织厂所生产的纺织品是不足称道的。它们是很著名的企业，但是它们出产的人造纤维织品是不好的。顾客们都在抱怨这些织品不好。
    莫斯科斯维德洛夫工厂所生产的人造纤维织品很好，能使顾客满意，因而他们宁肯买这些织品而不买外国织品，而三山纺织厂和第一印花布工厂未经认真准备，就开始生产人造纤维织品，他们将为这件事而丢脸。
    再不能容忍轻工业部门出产色泽单调、无光泽、灰黯和花样不好的织品了。工业部门应当出产颜色鲜艳、明亮悦目的不易脱色的纺织品。
    轻工业部门应按照季节设计和出产合乎消费者的要求和爱好的衣服。质量的不可分离的因素是产品的外表，如装饰，雅致牢固的包装，华丽的标签。
    应当指出，有些工业企业的商品装饰得很好，但这决不是说全苏联的、以及共和国的、合作社及地方的、尤其是各区的许多企业都作到了这一点。任务是要使在这方面落后的企业赶上先进企业的水平。我们所有的企业应出产质量好的商品，外部的装饰和包装都要坚固美观，要毫不逊色于外国的好式样。
    消费者对工业部门，特别是对食品部门的要求是合乎情理的，他们要求那些销路最广的商品能保存持久，品质不变。不能允许这样的情况存在：新出产的货物在头一时期品质很好，以后生产者对产品的注意就放松了，因而使品质降低。也不能允许工业部门不再出产那些畅销的货物。
    在贸易工作人员中迁就质量不好的货物进入贸易机构的现象，迄今一直没有根除，当工业部门供应不受居民欢迎的、式样陈旧的、外部装饰不好的商品时，往往马虎了事。
    当然，工业部门的领导工作人员会这样说：化学家们不给我们染料，我们有什么办法。工业工作人员和贸易工作人员心地善良，于是心就软了。他们应该有铁石般的心——决不让步。轻工业工作人员应督促化学家，在化学家面前不要心软，向化学家要求所必需的一切染料。在这方面作任何让步就是机会主义，而机会主义只能使事业毁灭。
    布尔什维克从来没有向弱点看齐过，因为这个看齐是与积极为人民谋福利的本质相矛盾的。贸易工作者大军应处处本着克服、消灭、弥补弱点的原则行事，而不要迁就弱点。由此得出结论：贸易工作人员不应容忍供应者向他提出的那些理由，如果这些理由违反消费者利益的话。
    贸易工作人员努力争取需要的商品种类，争取商品的质量高、装饰好，这就不仅是保护了消费者的利益，而且也保护了国家的利益，并且帮助了工业部门的工作人员把工作质量提高到新的更高的水平。
  苏联贸易部门与工业部门的利益是一致的：提高商品质量和关怀人民福利。为了改善贸易，批发机构已由工业部门移交贸易部。
    批发机构的移交，不只是由一个主管部门转交另一主管部门的一般移交，而是贸易机构中的根本改变，这在苏维埃贸易发展史上还是初次实行。把批发组织由工业部门移交贸易部，是为了把顾客的利益放在第一位，而工业部门的便利放在第二位。
    政府所通过的关于批发贸易和商品质量检查问题的决议，其深远意义就在于此。苏联贸易部批发机构在争取提高商品质量和争取必需的商品种类方面的作用应该急剧地提高。它们应该敏感地对待零售贸易机构的要求并尽力帮助它们改善贸易，应该解决如何消灭商品的迂回运转和如何扩大由工业企业直接运货到贸易企业等问题。
    编制计划的缺点之一就是地方贸易机构、商店的商品流转计划和对这个计划的商品供应之间缺少应有的联系。结果，某些机构所得到的货物多于完成商品流转计划所必需的货物，而其他的机构所得到的货物则少于计划所必需的数量。而如果注意到商店和贸易公司工作人员的工资是依靠完成计划的程度来改变的，那么，这个缺点的意义就更加深刻了。
    改善苏维埃家庭生活及公共饮食业的几个问题
    乌·伊·列宁曾对改造家务问题赋以重大的意义，认为这是为共产主义而斗争的条件之一。他写道：“妇女为琐碎的家务压着，窒息着，使她们变得愚钝和受到鄙视，把她们禁锢在炊爨和抚育小孩的事务上，以极端非生产的，琐碎的，劳神的，使人愚钝，折磨人的工作来浪费她们的劳动。妇女的真正解放，真正的共产主义，只有在这样的时候和这样的地方才能开始，即反对这种琐碎的家务的普遍斗争（由执掌国家政权的无产阶级领导）开始了，更确切点说，即把琐碎的家务普遍开始改造为大规模的社会主义经济。”（列宁全集第二十九卷，第三九六页）
    琐碎家务的普遍改造可以沿着几个方向进行，在这个问题上具有重大意义的是家务劳动的机械化，更确切一点说，即家务劳动的机器化。现在我们已有一切可能来很认真地注意到生产及采用现代化的消费工具及完美的机器，来服务于并改善我们的生活。
    苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会确定了生产家庭用机器的大规模计划。一九五五年将生产洗濯器十九万六千个，即为一九五三年的十一倍左右；将生产家用冰箱三十三万个，而本年仅为六万二千个；除尘器的产量将增为五倍，即每年将出产五十万个左右；电力擦地板器的产量将增为十倍。厨房内的日常用具，如马铃薯洗濯器，精制蔬菜用的器具，切面包机，盆碟洗涤器，电锅及电壶等的产量也将大大增加。
    有某些怀疑论者，特别是居心不善的人会说，这没有什么值得惊奇的！当然，我们此刻还不打算以我们的洗濯器、除尘器或冰箱的生产规模来使谁惊奇，我们现在只布置这个工作，但是我们准备弥补过去那种不足的生产速度，也许会使任何一个怀疑论者感到惊奇的。
  这些机器在我们社会主义国家内，在不久的将来，将成为大多数苏维埃家庭中不可缺少的家具。
    一九五六年缝纫机的生产将达三百万部，几乎为战前一九四零年的十七倍。从一九五四年开始，我们的工业将出产可以携带而使用方便的电力缝纫机。这种新型的缝纫机将使我国妇女感到非常方便。
    尽量发展公共饮食业是改善对劳动人民服务及改造琐碎家务的重要因素。在我们某些居民中根深蒂固地存在着一种不正确的看法，他们认为，食堂是不得已时才需要的。某些公共饮食业的工作人员对于自己职责的疏忽态度（他们忘记了必须准备可口的食物，忘记了应该迅速、周到地招待顾客），在不小的程度上助长了这种看法。
    和一切事情一样，在公共饮食业中也是干部决定一切。厨师是我们公共饮食业中最重要的工作人员之一；而厨师的职业是最荣誉和最受人尊敬的职业之一，因为厨师的工作每天都在颇大程度上直接影响着千千万万人的健康和工作能力。
    直到不久以前为止还实行的按菜肴的货币价值计算食堂工作人员工资的制度，刺激了高价菜肴的生产，因而削弱了需要费力劳动制作的蔬菜、面粉及碎麦菜肴的生产，并且降低了食物烹调的质量。
    现在这个缺点是消除了，从一九五三年十月起，中等及大食堂已改而实行按菜肴盘数计算厨房工作人员工资的办法。
    必须说明一下公共饮食企业的基本类型及每一种类型的任务。企业附设的食堂，因为有固定数量的食用者，完全可能考虑食用者的要求及口味。在各个工厂及矿山中已经有着不少的模范食堂。可以为例的有：“奥尔忠尼启则煤业”托辣斯的食堂，“列宁石油”托辣斯的食堂，克里佛伊罗格城的冶金工人食堂及其他食堂。但是，非常遗憾，还有不少食堂的工作作得很坏，并受到居民应有的责备。企业的经理及公共饮食业的工作人员应当设法根本改善企业附设食堂的工作。
    有些工作人员把今天十分迅速地增设点心部看作是公共饮食业的缺点，这种意见是不正确的，点心部帮助我们解决一个很重要的任务，即保证大家能在午休时间迅速而好好地吃点可口的东西。我们应该发展供应良好、招待周到的点心部网。
    必须同样设法大力改善大学生食堂、食品小卖部的工作，根据学生的预算组织饭食的制备。
    应把公共饮食企业的工作做得使食用者不至浪费很多时间去等待食物，而把时间利用来安静而舒适地吃饭。巴甫洛夫院士曾坚决建议，吃东西不要慌，要慢慢吃，因为“由于进食时吃得快和不注意，兴奋没有达到足够的强度，因此得不到足够的消化液来消化食物”（巴甫洛夫全集第二卷，第一册，第二六二页）。
    正确地组织学校中的儿童饮食将使苏维埃家庭减轻不少麻烦。在大部分学校里，我们有着设备很好的小卖部。但是小卖部对学生的服务都作得不能令人满意；学校食堂不够。学校的小卖部和食堂应该根据儿童体格成长的特殊要求准备专门适应儿童的营养的食品。
    公共饮食企业里菜肴的花样要多，要把菜肴做得外观美好，能吸引人并能引起人们的食欲。应该广泛地开展将做好的饭菜及烹调品送到家庭去的工作，这也可以减轻家务的麻烦。
    必须改善饭馆的工作，要服务得更为周到并大力提高烹调各种菜肴的质量，必须达到这样地步：使全家可以走进饭馆，并能在饭馆里请客，举办家庭庆宴，使得不仅丈夫、而且妻子都可过节日；否则，如果把客人接到家里，家里所有的人都过节日，女主人却例外，对她来说，客人到家就等于劳累不停，疲惫不堪。最后应该整顿在车站、码头、飞机场上的饭馆工作，应当大力改善餐车的工作。
    每当群众性游乐和游行时，为劳动人民服务也同样有着巨大意义。为此就需要组织流动性企业，借助于这种企业，可以在城内任何地方或城外组织对居民的服务。
    公共饮食企业在今年年初已有十万零六千个单位，即比一九四零年增加了百分之二十四点三，然而这已经不能使我们满意了。公共饮食企业的增加落后于城市经济的发展，有不少的例子，甚至于在莫斯科，当新建筑起大量住宅的时候，就没有足够的食堂和点心部。莫斯科市的新砂街区和纺织工人住宅区的居民人数相当于一个城市的人口，但是那里既没有食堂也没有点心部，这种缺陷应该很快消除。预定在一九五四—一九五六年间将新开一万一千个饭馆、食堂、点心部和其他公共饮食企业。
    减轻我们妇女家务劳动的方法之一，就是工业要增加现成的肉饼、肉类、鱼类半制品及各种烹调品的生产，商店要增加它们的售卖量。一九五五年，小腊肠及短节腊肠的生产规定增加为一九五三年的两倍，肉类半制品增加为三倍，饺子增加为两倍，肉饼增加为一点八倍，鱼类半制品和里脊肉，以及肉和鱼的烹调品的生产和出售量要大大增加。
    广泛发展缝衣铺，迅速增加出售工厂做的结实的衣服，也可在某些方面减轻我们苏维埃妇女的劳动，以免使她们不得不常常在家里缝制衣服。必须迅速地增加能在很多方面减轻妇女家务劳动的企业，如洗衣房，化学洗衣店，衣服鞋子修补店及其他日常社会服务的企业。
    提高贸易的服务水平
    国内商品愈多，则苏维埃消费者不仅对货物的质量，而且对贸易服务的质量也将提出更高的要求。贸易机构的最重要的任务之一，就是大力提高苏维埃贸易的服务水平。
    贸易的服务水平不仅表现在：把商店外观装饰得美丽，把营业间和其他房间弄得清洁整齐，并且应表现在：商品陈列得醒目美观，所有花样繁多的商品都有鲜明的标识，商品的迅速送递及给购买者另外一些的帮助，如量衣裳的尺寸，裁剪料子，把货品送到顾客家中及其他等等。
    要使商店内秩序井然、服务周到，首先得依靠商店经理。贸易企业的经理应该是一个良好的组织者，贸易工作人员的文明的教育者，商业的内行，他应该关切地听取顾客对货物质量的各种要求，并力求使工业部门执行这些要求。
    我们有一些优良的百货商店、食品商店及工业品商店，他们都表示出真正关心顾客，关心贸易组织的服务精神。但是一般的贸易服务水平却不能适应新的要求。我们的任务就在于争取胜利地完成商品流转计划，掀起为居民模范地服务的社会主义竞赛，广泛地在贸易的各个环节中发掘新窍门并加以推广，从而把所有的贸易企业提到先进的水平。
    提高贸易服务水平的根本问题之一，就是要优良而美观地包装出售的食品和工业品。在这方面，工业部门应该起很大作用，它们必须重新改变组织而出产最大数量的包装和分装的商品。但是，这个工作的很大部分是要依靠贸易工作人员的。商品往往是马马虎虎地用纸包上的。为了买点鱼子、乳渣、酪浆、蜂蜜、蜜饯、果子酱，顾客走进店里都得带上自己的器皿，本来是应由工业部门供给出售上述货品用的器皿的。
    如果说，最近几年来，在虽然还存在着严重缺点的情况下，一些食品和工业品的贸易的服务水平有了提高的话，那末在改善蔬菜和马铃薯贸易方面却做得很少。很多贸易工作人员竟会漠不关心地让马铃薯和蔬菜常常带着泥污出售，蔬菜卖出去的时候已经干萎了，顾客为买这些东西必须带个篮子或口袋。这种情况是不能容忍的。现在必须逐步地使顾客可买到用纸袋或网袋装的马铃薯，和有罐头或小桶装的酸白菜。
    很多贸易机构的领导者都不关心采用极简单的机械以提高售货员的劳动生产率，大大减轻他们的劳动，保证更快更正确地递送商品。所以我们的任务就要尽可能地运用这些简单的机械，广泛地采用能提高贸易的服务水平的新机械。
    贸易的服务水平还要求很好地做广告，我们苏维埃广告的任务在于向人民报道关于商品的确切的知识，帮助他们注意新的商品，培养新的口味和需求，宣传新的货物，解释商品使用的方法。我们苏维埃广告完全没有像资本主义竞争所引起的那种滥用的现象，例如美国在一九五一年用于广告的费用就达六十五亿美元。这项耗费的惊人之处在于：它相当于美国政府用于教育及社会保险开支总数的二点三倍。资本主义国家中的广告事业不是服务于消费者的利益，而是商号间为招徕顾客彼此竞争的一种手段，而且常常是欺骗顾客的。
    苏维埃广告最重要的是，应该以真挚正确、准确明显的词句说明商品内容、质量及特点。人们都记得我们伟大的诗人马雅柯夫斯基为广告所写的中肯的诗句：
     “再不需要
            怀疑和考虑——
    妇女们用的东西
            都在国营百货店里。”
      “这样好的奶头
              空前绝后——
    我愿吮它
            直到高寿。”
      “凉拌菜、调料汁以及别的美味餐
              使用这种油
                绝后空前。”
    我们有很多的广告常是不生动的，公式化的，不灵活的。举例来说，我们现在竟能遇到这样的广告：“请喝‘啤酒管理局’各工厂所出的啤酒吧”。应该认真地展开我们的广告事业，使它成为顾客的一个得力的助手。为了改善广告事业，必须为广告及橱窗所需的器材及材料组织现代化的生产以代替手工制品。
    遗憾的是，售货员对顾客还有疏忽，不关心，而且常常是粗暴的态度。这是不可容忍的。苏维埃商店的工作人员应该尊敬顾客，在礼貌这方面我们应该作大大的努力。无论在商店里、在电车上礼貌都不够，在大街上礼貌也不够。总的任务就是要注意彼此间的礼貌，对妇女、对儿童的礼貌。
    商店里应该有礼貌地接待，但我们这点做得非常不够，曾有一桩这样的事情：有一个斯大林格勒百货公司纺织品部的女售货员，当顾客问她，什么地方可以买到市布，她回答说：“我不是您的问事处，女公民。”这是什么态度呢。
    当我们苏联人走进商店时，他应当由于自己买到满意的东西，由于所买到的货物的质量及外观而情绪很好，他应当可以相信，他所买的东西会使家里的所有成员——大人、小孩都满意。与这种情绪有不小的关系的是：他将受到什么样的招待，货物将以何种方式递送到他面前，他购买时花费了多少时间。因此就要求一个贸易人员对顾客要有礼貌并表示关切。
    贸易工作人员也要请顾客同样以礼貌待他，要求尊敬售货员的劳动。关于这一点，也有些情形是，某些顾客提出毫无根据的苛求，有时对售货员抱轻视的态度。
    对苏维埃贸易工作人员抱轻视的态度，这是旧时代的残余思想。这种态度应该彻底铲除，我们苏维埃贸易工作者完全没有追逐利润的想法和商人习气的。他们是社会主义劳动大军中的一个支队，完成着日常为人民服务的光荣任务。斯大林同志说过，贸易在我们这里早已成为我们布尔什维克自己的一桩事业，而贸易工作人员，只要他们真诚地工作，他们就是我们革命的布尔什维克事业的服务员。
    在国营的和合作社的贸易中工作的有三百多万人，这是一支劳动者的大军。我们工作的成就将取决于干部的选拔、培养和教育工作的改善，苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会，已决定将五所高等学校移交给苏联贸易部管理并扩大招生名额，此外，将一所学院交给全苏消费合作社中央联合会管理。这将使在高等学校里的大学生的训练更适合贸易的实际需求，并能加强高等贸易学校中的科学工作者对贸易部的帮助。即使在贸易工作中，如果没有科学，我们也不能前进。
    我们也需要大力加强把一些有丰富的实际经验的贸易工作人员培养成为具有高等或中等教育的专家的工作，把他们送到两年制领导人员训练班及高等贸易学校中去学习，这些学校的招生额将增至每年一千二百人。苏联苏维埃贸易函授学院及专科中学函授部的招生额将大量增加。
    应该大力开展在训练班、贸易和烹调学校中以及用个别训练或小组训练的方式培养售货员、厨师及其他一般职业的工作人员，这是培养已从七年制学校毕业的青年干部的一个重要方法。从一九五四年到一九五五年，每年我们应当在贸易和烹调学校及各种专门贸易学校中培养二万五千人，以个别训练和小组训练的方式培养二万五千人，用在各种训练班中提高贸易工作人员熟练程度的方法培养十二万八千人。
    很多贸易机构的领导者仍然对选拔干部的工作漠不关心，不去在实际工作中研究他们。
    贸易工作人员被信托处理大批的商品物质财富，他们应该像保护自己的眼珠一样保护它们。但是在贸易机构中竟还有浪费和盗窃的现象。检查虽然常常进行，差不多每个月都进行，但是其中很多检查是表面的。现在决定，不作那么频繁的检查，而是吸收些比较熟练的工作人员参加，来作更周密的检查。在保护国家资金和财富的工作中，贸易工作人员的任务是，在商店、仓库、货栈中，保证及时地进行商品质量文件的检查及财产盘点，以创造杜绝浪费及偷窃现象的环境。
    我们处在苏维埃贸易大大繁荣的前夕，报纸是保证我们党的路线得以在贸易中执行的方法之一。因此决定出版贸易报，自一九五三年十一月开始发行，这不是偶然的，而是具有重大意义的。我们现在迫切需要一个全苏联报刊的论坛来传播先进的经验，巧妙迅速地抓住并大力宣扬贸易中新生的、先进的、有前途的事物，批评那些陈腐的、墨守成规的现象。报纸上应该经常发表消费者的呼声和他们对贸易及工业的要求，使他们也能在贸易报上发现感到有兴趣的东西，而不仅是那些只使苏联贸易工作人员感兴趣的东西。
    改善贸易服务的重要条件之一，就是商店、饭馆、食堂、咖啡馆、小卖部要在最便利于广大顾客的时间内工作。近数月来，在各共和国、各城市都规定了商店、饭馆、食堂、咖啡馆、小卖部营业的新时间。其中好些都增了工作班。同时照顾到当地的条件、特点、各种不同贸易企业工作的特征，这是以前所没有的。
    加强贸易的物质技术基础
    战后几年来，又新开设了十三万六千所商店，和八万五千个销售处，扩大了专业商店的数目，现在所有的专业商店约为四万三千所。专业商店在城市和工人镇总贸易网中的比重为百分之四十五。在战后时期增加得特别迅速增加的专业商店是：鞋店一九五三年增加为一九四零年的九点五倍，布店四点四倍，服装店一点七倍。专业商店为顾客创造了更方便的条件，并更加全面地研究顾客的需求。
    但是，国内零售商品流转额的增长比较贸易企业网的发展来得更快。按比较价格计算，一九五三年零售商品流转额比一九四零年增加百分之七十九，而零售贸易企业的数量截至今年年初为止共只增加了百分之八点四，企业中售货枱的数目增加了百分之七点八。这无疑影响了对顾客的服务，使许多城市商店的工作过于繁重。
    应该指出：最近煤矿工业部、石油工业部以及冶金工业部都在矿井、采油场和工厂大规模地进行着有优良设备的商店和食堂的建设。但是，有些贸易机构完成它们一九五三年发展贸易网的任务的情形不能令人满意。以乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国地方贸易来说（部长是萨赫诺夫斯基同志），年度计划规定增设商店二百八十五所，但上半年却只增设了六十所：以白俄罗斯苏维埃社会主义共和国来说（部长是科托沃道夫同志），年度计划规定增设商店七十七所。但上半年却只增设了二十一所。
    必须特别注意这样的一些不可容忍的事实，即藉口各种原因而关闭了一些现有的商店。今年上半年由于各种原因关闭的商店有一千九百四十家。
    在地方贸易机构的放任之下，直到现在还有将商店用屋占作别用的情形。在莫斯科，贸易机构的工作非常繁重，但有一百所以上位于新建住宅下层的商店用屋被占作别用。苏联贸易部和莫斯科市苏维埃正在采取措施来腾出这些房屋，以便直接用于商业上。苏联的其他城市中也应该采用这样的措施。
    有些地方的商店的分布是自流的，地方贸易机构没有采取必要的措施来有组织地着手进行这项工作。
    有些城市可以采取合并现有贸易企业的措施，只要这是合适的，并且是有利于更好地为顾客服务的，这一来，贸易机构中的很大一部分缺点就可以消除了。
    莫斯科市的贸易机构在一九五二—一九五三年间合并了一百八十二所小商店，使用了曾被占为别用的十九所店房，从而组织了八十八所大食品商店和工业品商店。除莫斯科外，其他许多城市，如列宁格勒、里加、基辅、敖德萨等也都进行了商店合并的工作。这仅是重大而且有益的工作的开始。有许多商店的设备情况是很坏的，而且它们的房屋还需要大修。房主照例地拒绝大修，但是贸易机构又无权对所租用的房屋花费财力进行大修。因此，现在赋予各贸易机构一个这样的权限，即可以用百分之五十以下的租金作为租用商业房屋的大修费。
    为了消灭零售贸易网发展的落后现象，计划于一九五四—一九五六年在城市和农村建筑并开设四万个商店，而过去三年内才建筑了一万九千个。在今后三年中，预定在各州的中心和工业城市建筑一百所大、中等的百货店。
    贸易的物质技术基础方面的投资在急剧地增加着。贸易部在一九五四年将为此目的拨出十七亿卢布，一九五三年仅为七亿五千万卢布，即增为二点三倍。
    最近在莫斯科红场将开设苏联最大的百货公司——国营百货公司。它将用先进的现代贸易设备装备起来。
    红场上房屋上层的商店用屋现在已由占用机关腾出，改建为国营百货公司的用屋，革命前，许多商号曾在这里开设了约有二百四十所小型的贸易企业。在国营百货公司内，苏联的消费者可以买到包罗万象的高质量的商品。
    在百货公司内将开设大型的男女服装成衣店，定做个人服装。在国营百货公司的下层，模范食品商店总管理局将开设一个最大的食品商店。在国营百货公司内将有一千多个售货员同时工作，而柜台的全长将达二公里半。
    无疑地，新的国营百货公司是不会和旧的国营百货公司相同的。而当时马雅柯夫斯基所曾经对国营百货公司所说的话，是更适合于新的国营百货公司的。他当时在广告中写道：“胃、身体或头脑所需要的一切，——国营百货公司都有”。我们想使贸易的经营向国营百货公司看齐。现在被各机关占用的莫斯科鲁比扬斯基商场的房屋，正要组织有三百个售货枱的百货公司“儿童世界”。这将是为年幼的苏联消费者所设立的国营儿童百货公司。此外，还需要设立若干个大商店。
    在一九四九年，国营贸易机构的食品商店和食堂有冷藏设备的仅占百分之五。截至一九五三年七月一日为止，国营贸易机构的商店和食堂中装有压缩式冷冻机的约为一九四九年的七倍，即为一九四零年的十二倍半。
    仅在苏联贸易部系统内，到今年年初，就有百分之五十四出卖易腐货物的商店，和百分之五十的公共饮食企业都装置了机器冷冻设备。在今后三年内，计划将压缩式冷冻机和冷藏设备的生产至少增为三倍，并要进一步改善和改进这些设备。
    妥善设立仓库对于正确组织贸易是有巨大意义的。
    目前贸易仓库是处于完全无人过问的状态。只有在冷藏仓库方面我们是前进了一大步，其面积已增为一九四零年的两倍。从技术水平来看，我们的冷藏事业，堪与任何发达的资本主义国家的冷藏设备相颉颃。但是一九五三年批发贸易机构的食品仓库的容量仍未达到战前水平，一九四零年为五十二万八千吨，而一九五三年仅为三十万吨。
    战后时期没有完全消除战争的破坏，也没有建成在数量方面符合于目前需要的蔬菜和马铃薯的保管仓库。尤其是一部分临时性质的保管仓库已经崩颓了。因此，蔬菜仓库和马铃薯仓库的容量到今年一月一日为止仅为二百三十九万六千吨，即比一九四零年减少百分之三十。
    工业品仓库，照例是零星的、分散的，设立在不恰当的地方，因而零售贸易不能进行必要的商品分类。
    当然，纵然仓库不足，优秀的组织者们也仍在安排工作。所以现在就要改善批发贸易，不要等待我们把很多完美的仓库建筑好了才作。现在就应该采取实际措施来改善对于零售贸易的服务。
    在新仓库的建筑方面所采取的路线在原则上是不正确的。现在每一个批发机构在城市的各个角落为自己建立了个别的、独立的小仓库，地区是分散的，这就妨碍了零售供应工作。
    十分明显，为了减少建筑费用，特别是减低使用仓库的成本，为了保证装卸工作的机械化，批发仓库就必须集中建筑在一个场地、一所大厦或一列大厦内，小城市只在一个地方建筑，而大城市可以在市内几个主要区域建筑。
    最近政府已经批准了一个庞大计划，要大规模地建筑冷藏库和储藏食品及工业品的批发仓库，蔬菜及马铃薯的储藏所，以及各地方贸易办事处的小型批发仓库。
    我们应当组织大型的、合作化的仓库以代替分散的、各自设有管理机构以及需要高额流转费用的仓库。这种大型的、合作化的仓库的装、卸货物及仓库内部的各种操作，以及全部发送工作完全是机械化的。
    仓库的合理组织形式就是组织公用仓库。一九五四年计划在莫斯科、列宁格勒、巴库、罗斯托夫、古比雪夫、斯大林诺及其他城市着手建设大型的批发仓库。
    仓库业务不仅为储藏当时的物资所需要，同时也需要很大面积来保存季节性的商品，以便保证全年供应居民所需要的各种货物。譬如，制造毡靴的工厂是全年工作的，但是居民只有秋天或初冬才开始买毡靴，这就意味着需要有在夏天保存这些货物的仓库。套鞋、夏季用的纺织品及一切季节性货物都是一样，因为这些货物都是全年进行生产，而需求却是有季节性的。
    有时我们有这样的情形，寒冷袭来了，商店里毡靴却不够供应，可是在春天或夏天，当毡靴不需要的时候，它们却在商店里出现了。其他季节性的货物也是如此，如在春天，夏季用的纺织品及靴鞋却不够用。而到了冬天，这些货物却在商店内堆积起来了。关于食品，如动物油、肉类、鱼类、糖的季节储备问题也是很尖锐的，因为它们的生产是有季节性的，而需求却是经常的。
    为了改善贸易组织并保证很好地向商店运送货物起见，我们必须在短期内广泛地组织专门的汽车运输。
    遗憾得很，直到现在，由于专用运输汽车为数甚少，以致大部分易腐的商品、衣服、家具及其他货物都堆积在普通的汽车上运输，这就造成商品的损坏，或使它失掉商品的原形。
    我们的任务是要根本改组食品及工业品的运输工作，并在最近两三年内将贸易专用运输汽车至少增至两万辆。专用运输汽车同时应该作为运输货物的实物广告。这种运输还会在某种程度上活跃和点缀街道，并能使顾客们悦目。
    在供货地点装货时，应用供货人方面的人力物力，在贸易企业卸货时则应用贸易机构的力量。有时，在用运输汽车运输货物时，却有搬运工人坐在车上，这种情况是不可容忍的。我们应该迅速消灭这种搬运工人在运输汽车上，从装货地点坐到卸货地点的浪费现象。
    关于进一步发展合作社和集体农庄贸易
    由于集体农庄制度的胜利，我们乡村的面貌根本改变了。因而我们应该对乡村贸易提出其他要求。
    我们社会主义社会中，城乡商品流转的发展促进了工农联盟的巩固，商品的结合形式补充了工人阶级同农民间的生产结合形式。
    乡村贸易也在迅速增长着。一九五三年乡村的商品流转额增为一九二五年的七点九倍（按比较价格计算），并且也大大超过了战前一九四零年的商品流转额。
    今年，由于实行了大力扩展我国商品流转的补充措施，乡村的商品流转额也大大增加了。如果说，一九五三年第一季度消费合作社商品流转额与上年同期比较，增加百分之三点五，那末第二季度就比去年同期增加百分之二十八，第三季度比去年同期增加百分之二十七点五。这说明了乡村贸易也开始急剧地高涨。乡村贸易的结构改变了。目前农村居民个人消费品的需求，愈益接近城市居民的需求。
    举出下面这样的材料并不是没有意义的：一九二四—一九二五年度，食盐、煤油、火柴、家用肥皂和棉织品约占乡村合作社商品流转总额的百分之三十五，而在一九五二年，这些商品仅占百分之十八，虽然在数量方面是大为增加了。
    如果说一九五二年全年消费合作社各种纺织品的销售量与一九四零年相比增加了百分之四十一（按比较价格计算），那么丝织品则增加为三点一倍。绸缎缝制成衣在乡村的销售量最近三年来增加为五倍，毛布衣服——二点六倍，毛布大衣——二点二倍。一九五三年在乡村出售的自行车将为一九四零年的六倍，无线电收音机——十三点六倍，缝纫机——六倍，照相机——四点八倍。这是因为集体农民和乡村知识分子物质福利提高的缘故。
    苏联乡村中的教师的人数一九五二年为一九一三年的七倍，农艺师和其他农业专家——三十倍，医师——七倍。在苏联乡村中约有两百万名农业机械师。
    如果说，一九二五年即我国农业集体化以前，我国在乡村销售的出版物仅占总发行量的百分之四点六，那末一九五二年就占百分之二十五点九。
    乡村建筑范围的扩大引起了对建筑材料的巨大的需求。最近一年中，政府采取了大力增加售给乡村建筑材料的措施。一九五三年在乡村出售的木材及成材将为一九四零年的十三点三倍，即为战后第一个五年计划期间的四点五倍；水泥——四十三倍，即为战后第一个五年计划期间的两倍；屋顶毡——将近二十倍，即为五年计划期间的二点五倍；钉子——四点五倍，即为一九四六—一九五零年的两倍。
    这一切说明了乡村是处在一个完全不同的发展阶段，合作社也具有了新的意义，担负了新的任务。
    我们的任务是，尽可能迅速地消灭乡村中建筑材料贸易方面的一切缺点。
    近年来，农业的技术改造产生了乡村贸易的一些新的部门，特别是具有生产用途的商品的贸易。
  一九五三年分配给农村出售的载重汽车几乎等于过去五年（一九四六年到一九五零年年底）的总数，拨给机器拖拉机站的还未计算在内。
    消费合作社工作人员的任务是不间断地进行具有生产用途的商品的贸易。
    消费合作社是有力的公共贸易机构。它拥有三千二百万以上的社员。但是乡村贸易却落后于乡村居民日益增长的需求。
    第一，消费合作社不能保证供给乡村居民所需要的许多商品。甚至到现在，消费合作社还没有消除这样可耻的事实，即本来应该数量无限制地供给合作社的日用商品如煤油、火柴和食盐等的供售也还有间断。
    第二，消费合作社机构很少研究乡村居民对商品的需求，在个别场合甚至于不考虑这些需求。
    第三，对在乡村中发展贸易网的问题，没有加以必要的注意。消费合作社的商店的数目还没有达到战前的水平，这是由于以前被占领地区的贸易网还没有完全恢复，乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国只为战前的百分之八十八点三，白俄罗斯苏维埃社会主义共和国只为战前的百分之八十点四，斯摩棱斯克州只为战前的百分之八十二。
    全苏消费合作社中央联合会应采取措施在最近两三年内消灭在乡村发展零售贸易中的落后现象。为补充固定贸易网之不足，应组织数千个流动商店，以按照严格的日程表定期送货的办法为小的居民点服务。
    集体农庄贸易是苏维埃贸易的重要组成部分。现已具备进一步开展此种形式的贸易的一切条件。但是各地贸易工作人员很少在组织出售剩余农产品方面帮助集体农庄和集体农民，并且对集体农庄市场的领导工作也作得不好。
    我们国家各地有大量的集体农庄市场。到一九五三年一月一日为止，全苏联有八千四百七十四个市场，其中四千一百个在城市，四千三百七十四个是在乡村。集体农庄和集体农民每年运来大量粮食到市场出售。在许多大城市里建立了带顶棚的集体农庄市场。现在我们有不少设备很完善的市场。但是集体农庄市场的情况还不能认为是令人满意的。
    一半的城市市场还没有保管集体农庄和集体农民所运来之货物的仓库和冷藏库。约有一千五百个城市市场还没有肉类和乳类检查站。铺地板和铺沥青的城市市场只占市场总面积的百分之三十六点二。
    可以找出很多城市市场工作不好的例子，但是许多乡村市场无人过问的情况更为严重。
    目前在集体农庄贸易领域内需要解决什么任务才能使这种贸易大大前进呢？
    集体农庄市场和地方贸易主管机关的工作人员应采取紧急措施，为集体农庄和集体农民在市场上出售剩余农产品创造有利条件。
    每一个区、州、边疆区和共和国应拟定并实行
  一九五四年整理集体农庄市场的措施；应在最近两三年内完成所有城市市场的铺地板或铺沥青的工作。
    在市场和市场附近的街道上，应开展集体农庄和集体农民所需要的工业品的贸易，首先是生产用的和家用商品；消费合作社工作人员应不断地接受集体农庄和集体农民委托代销的农产品。
    大家知道，当农民忙于田间工作的时候，向市场运送产品就必会减少。
    如果除了集体农民自己出卖产品以外，合作社根据委托代销的原则，接受集体农庄和集体农民的委托，组织出售农产品，那么在农忙时期就不会有这种农产品向市场的运输减少的情形。
    同时合作社也可以保证集体农民获得在市场上所能得到的那些进款，减少集体农民的运输费用并可不致牵掣田间工作时期的劳动力。
    合作社应以事实向男女集体农民证明此种贸易形式的好处。
    其次，地方苏维埃执行委员会、采购机构、机器拖拉机站的工作人员、贸易工作人员和集体农庄市场的工作人员，应该在向集体农庄市场运输农产品方面给集体农庄和集体农民各种援助。
    为此目的，应利用机器拖拉机站、采购机构、消费合作社、汽车运输和公路部的地方机构的闲暇的运输工具。首先利用空放的汽车。
    有大量的汽车到城市来取货。试问为什么不能有组织地用这些汽车运送到市场上来的集体农民呢？
    政府已责成有关各部和主管机关在集体农庄和集体农民向集体农庄市场出售剩余农产品时，在运输方面给以种种援助。
    同样必须保证一次合理地征收新的市场税，
  （这项税收自今年十月一日起已减低百分之三十）和新的市场服务费（这项费用已降低了百分之六十五），借以促进集体农庄贸易的发展。
    同志们！我们遵照政府决议所召开的苏联全国贸易工作者代表会议在发展贸易的转变关头开会了。
    苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会所通过的关于扩大食品生产与扩大日用品生产并改进其质量的决议，以及关于进一步发展苏联贸易的措施的决议，是国家保证人民消费品急剧高涨的伟大纲领，是繁荣苏维埃贸易的伟大纲领。
    我想，为这些历史性的决议所鼓舞着的苏维埃贸易工作人员大军，一定会发挥自己的力量、精力和才能，在地方苏维埃和党组织的援助和支持之下，光荣而称职地担当起这项大力开展和繁荣苏维埃贸易的崇高任务。
