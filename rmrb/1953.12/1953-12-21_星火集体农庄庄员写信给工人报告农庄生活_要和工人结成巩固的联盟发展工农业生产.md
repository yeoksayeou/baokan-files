Xinghuo Collective Farm Members Write to Workers Reporting on Farm Life
To Form a Solid Alliance with Workers to Develop Industrial and Agricultural Production
Dear worker elders:

    We are members of the Xinghuo Collective Farm in Huachuan County, Songjiang Province.

    First of all, we would like to thank you for actively realizing the national industrialization and striving to develop industrial production. Every member of our farm has realized that only under the leadership of the working class can the peasants be liberated and build a better life. Recently, we studied the general line of the state during the transition period, which made our direction clearer and strengthened our confidence in building the farm and supporting the country's industrial construction.

    Our farm now has 71 households and 310 people. Before liberation, all the farm members suffered from the oppression and exploitation of landlords and rich peasants. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we overthrew the feudal landlord class, received 1,395 mu of land, and began to build a new life on the grasslands of the Great Northern Wilderness.

    In 1948, the Party led us to organize 22 mutual aid teams, which initially solved the difficulties in production. Although the crops suffered from natural disasters that year, we still harvested more than 5,000 jin of grain per hectare (15 mu), more than 1,000 jin per hectare more than during the puppet Manchukuo period. This was the beginning of a happy life. In 1950, the government established an agricultural machinery station in the tenth district of Huachuan, bringing a large number of new agricultural implements to help our peasants develop production. All of a sudden, our village became different every year. That year, our village had a horse-drawn farm tool. Because the land of the original mutual aid team was scattered, it was not easy to use. Under the leadership of the Party, an agricultural production cooperative was established to connect the land, so that the horse-drawn farm tools could be used. That year, we harvested more than 6,000 jin of grain per hectare. With horse-drawn farm tools, everyone was looking forward to using tractors. In 1951, the government really sent tractors to our village. In this way, the land was not enough, and we needed large tracts of land to cultivate. At this time, the Party led us to organize a collective farm. Later, we got a lot of new machines made by you, and our life became better and better.

    Mechanized production has brought bumper harvests to the farm year after year. In the first year of the farm's establishment, the whole farm planted 95 hectares of rice. Machines did only a quarter of the work. The land plowed by tractors was not much, and most of the work was done manually. In the autumn harvest, the average yield was more than 8,800 jin of rice per hectare. Last year, we planted 186 hectares, and machines did 30 percent of the work. The land plowed by tractors accounted for 64 percent, and the average yield was 11,000 jin per hectare. This year, we planted 202 hectares, and plowing, harrowing, and sowing are all done by machines. Mechanical production has reached 40 percent, and the average yield is more than 12,000 jin per hectare. This is one-third higher than the average yield of the local agricultural production cooperative, one-half higher than the mutual aid team, and twice as high as the individual households.

    You not only help us to cultivate the land with machines, but also provide us with electricity and other production machines. We use electricity to pump water for irrigation, so we are no longer afraid of the threat of waterlogging and drought. In the past, threshing and winnowing were done manually, but now everything from threshing to making rice, and even chopping grass, is done by electricity. Machine production saves a lot of labor. For example, electric water pumping saves the farm more than 3,000 workdays, allowing us to develop various sideline productions with manpower. The farm's livestock farm now has 82 cattle, 12 horses, 70 pigs, and 280 ducks. In addition, there are 3 hectares of orchards, which increase the farm's income by 500 million yuan every year.

    With the continuous development of farm production, the living standards and cultural levels of the farm members are also constantly improving. Last year, each workday earned 45,200 yuan, and this year it will be 60,000 yuan. Most of the farm members do 300 workdays per year, and the income of an ordinary farm member is more than 13 million yuan. If calculated by family, it will be even more. For example, Li Zhongyuan's family, with two full laborers, each did 250 workdays this year, and the two earned a total of 30 million yuan. All 71 households in the farm have completely gotten rid of poverty, and their living standards exceed those of ordinary middle peasants. Each person can buy 8 zhang of cloth per year, every family has installed electric lights and radios, and built beautiful new houses. This year, in addition to living expenses, each family has an average savings of more than 5 million yuan. Li Zhongyuan's family has deposited 12 million yuan in the bank. In the past, children could not afford to go to school, but now 110 adults in the farm have entered night school, 18 young people are in middle school, 27 are in senior primary school, and 38 children are studying in junior primary school. The whole farm has subscribed to 51 newspapers and periodicals.

    Every member of our farm has experienced from their own experience that peasants and workers are as inseparable as fish and water. When studying the general line this time, looking back at the road we have traveled in the past three years, we have more clearly recognized the relationship between national industrialization and our peasants. Everyone unanimously stated that they would support the country's industrial construction. Recently, we sold all 1.86 million jin of surplus grain to the state to increase the country's construction power.

    In order to strive to produce more grain next year to support national construction, the farm has now reclaimed 138 hectares of wasteland, expanded and renovated water conservancy projects, prepared improved varieties, and bought ten horses. The farm will gradually expand, and we plan to absorb more than 40 new farm members.

    Finally, all our farm members express to you: Under the leadership of the working class, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. You strengthen industrial construction, we strive to develop agricultural production, and let our country transition to socialism as soon as possible!
                  All Members of Xinghuo Collective Farm

    星火集体农庄庄员写信给工人报告农庄生活
    要和工人结成巩固的联盟发展工农业生产亲爱的工人老大哥们：
    我们是松江省桦川县星火集体农庄的庄员。
    首先对你们积极实现国家工业化和努力发展工业生产表示感谢。我们每个庄员都已认识到只有在工人阶级领导下，农民才能得到解放和建设美好的生活，最近我们学习了国家在过渡时期的总路线，更加明确了前进方向，增强了我们建设农庄、支援国家工业建设的信心。
    我们农庄现在有七十一户，三百一十口人。解放前，全体农庄庄员都受尽了地主富农的压迫和剥削。解放后，在共产党和毛主席领导下，推翻了封建地主阶级，分到了一千三百九十五亩土地，在北大荒的草原上才开始建设起新的生活。
    一九四八年，党领导我们组织了二十二个互助组，初步解决了生产上的困难。那年庄稼虽然遭了自然灾害，每垧（十五市亩）地还打了五千多斤粮食，比伪满时期每垧多打一千多斤。这就是幸福生活的开始。一九五○年，政府在桦川第十区成立了农业机器站，带来大批的新式农具，帮助咱农民发展生产。这一下子咱村里就一年比一年不同了。这一年咱村来了一台马拉农具，因为原来互助组的土地零散，不好使用，就在党的领导下成立了农业生产合作社，把土地连片，使上了马拉农具，这年每垧地就打了六千多斤粮食。有了马拉农具，大家又盼望着使拖拉机，一九五一年政府真给我们村送来了拖拉机。这样土地连片又不够了，还要有大块地才能耕种，这时，党又领导我们组织了集体农庄。以后又得到很多你们制造的新机器，我们的生活就越过越美好了。
    机械化生产，给农庄年年带来了丰收。成立农庄的第一年，全庄种了九十五垧水稻，用机器干的活只占四分之一，拖拉机翻的地也不多，大部分活还靠人工干，秋收每垧平均打了八千八百多斤稻子。去年种一百八十六垧，机器干的活占到百分之三十，拖拉机翻的地占百分之六十四，每垧平均打一万一千斤。今年种二百○二垧，耕、耙、播种都用机器，机械生产已达到百分之四十，每垧平均打到一万二千多斤了。比当地农业生产合作社的平均产量高出三分之一，比互助组高二分之一，比单干户高一倍。
    你们不但帮助我们用机器种地，还供给我们电力和其他的生产机器。我们用电力抽水灌溉，就再也不怕水涝旱灾的威胁。以前打稻、扬稻都用人工，现在从脱谷到制成米，甚至铡草都全部用电力了。机器生产节省了很多劳动力，比如电力抽水，就给农庄节省了三千多个劳动日，使我们有人工来发展各种副业生产。农庄的畜牧场里现有八十二头牛、十二匹马、七十口猪和二百八十只鸭子。另外还有三垧果木园子，这些方面每年使农庄增加了五亿元的收入。
    农庄生产不断地发展，庄员们生活水平和文化水平也不断提高。去年每个劳动日分得四万五千二百元，今年就分到六万元了。庄员中最多的每人每年做到三百个劳动日，一个普通的庄员收入总在一千三百万元以上。若是以家庭算就更多了。像李忠源家，两个整劳动力，今年每人做了二百五十个劳动日，两人共分到三千万元。全庄七十一户都已彻底摆脱了穷困，生活水平超过了一般的中农。每人每年可以买八丈布，家家都按上了电灯和收音机，盖了漂亮的新屋。今年除了生活开支，平均每家还有五百多万元的存款，李忠源家就存了一千二百万元在银行里。过去孩子们都念不起书，现在全庄有一百一十个成年人进了夜校，十八个青年上中学、二十七个上高小，还有三十八个儿童在初小里念书。全庄订了五十一份报纸和期刊。
    我们每个庄员都从自己的经历中体验到农民和工人就像鱼和水一样离不开。这次学习总路线时，回过头看一看三年来走过的道路，更加认清了国家工业化和咱农民的关系，大家一致表示要支援国家工业建设。最近我们把一百八十六万斤余粮全部卖给了国家，增加国家建设的力量。
    为了争取明年生产更多的粮食支援国家建设，现在农庄已开垦了一百三十八垧荒地，增修和整修了水利工程，准备了良种，还买了十匹马。农庄还要逐步扩大，我们准备吸收四十多户新庄员。
    最后，我们全体庄员向你们表示：在工人阶级领导下巩固工农联盟。你们加强工业建设，我们努力发展农业生产，让我们的国家早点过渡到社会主义！
                  星火集体农庄全体庄员
