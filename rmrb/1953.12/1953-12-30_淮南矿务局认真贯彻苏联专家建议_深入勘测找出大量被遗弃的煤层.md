    Huainan Mining Bureau Seriously Implements Soviet Experts' Suggestions
    Conducts In-Depth Exploration to Find a Large Number of Abandoned Coal Seams
    The Huainan Mining Bureau of East China Region has seriously implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts and found more than one million tons of coal that had been abandoned in the local area above the existing mining level of the Jiulonggang Coal Mine. The exploitation of these coal seams will give full play to the equipment capacity of the existing mines, extend the life of the mines, and save a lot of basic construction investment for the country.
    The Jiulonggang Coal Mine has been mined for decades. In the past, under the plundering exploitation of Japanese imperialism and Kuomintang bureaucratic capital, the coal that was easy to mine was mined, and the coal that was difficult to mine was discarded, which destroyed the regularity and continuity of coal seam exploitation. A large number of resources were abandoned underground, shortening the service life of the mine. After liberation, the mine did not pay attention to the geological work of the producing mines, and the past data was incomplete. Once a fault was encountered, it was considered that the coal had been mined out, and it was required to extend the mine to exploit the deep coal. In April of this year, Xu Daben, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government, and Soviet expert Yuri Lev came to the Huainan Coal Mine and inspected the drawings of the old mine, and found that many coal seams were not continuously mined, and there were many "blank areas." At that time, the Soviet experts suggested organizing forces to carry out coal exploration work in these "blank areas" to extend the life of the mine, give full play to the equipment capacity of the existing mine, and save the country's investment in mine infrastructure construction. The Huainan Mining Bureau accepted the suggestions of the Soviet experts and organized a "Mine Geological Work Group" to carry out this work.
    The workers and technicians of the geological work group overcame many difficulties and displayed a high degree of hard work spirit in carrying out this work. In the past seven months, they have traveled all the roadways they could enter and surveyed more than 3,200 meters of rock gateways. In order to find all the coal seams that had been lost in the past, they knocked down the required rocks for detailed research and analysis. Some roadways could not be entered for exploration due to disrepair or being scrapped for many years, so they held symposiums with old workers to collect information in this regard. Then, they made plans and used roadway exploration and drilling methods to explore the reserves of coal. So far, 1,029,000 tons of coal have been found in the local "blank areas" above the existing mining level of the mine and in the "coal-free areas" that were previously considered. At present, the geological work group is working hard to draw various charts and compile geological reports to facilitate the production department to determine the mining plan as soon as possible. Inspired by the suggestions of Soviet experts, the Geological Exploration Department of the Mining Bureau used hand-held drills to carry out small-scale drilling outside the eastern boundary of the Jiulonggang mining area, and found a 2.1-meter-thick coal seam more than 70 meters deep from the ground, proving that the original mining area boundary line in the east of the mine has changed, and at the same time criticized the past blindness of mining coal only in the longitudinal direction and abandoning the development in the two wings.
    The fact that the suggestions of Soviet experts have immediately achieved results in production has made the Huainan Coal Mine workers further realize the great significance of learning from Soviet advanced experience and implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts in accelerating the country's socialist industrialization construction, and has encouraged all workers to strive for the realization of national industrialization. At the same time, they sincerely appreciate the help and guidance of Soviet experts to the Huainan Coal Mine. Chai Dengbang, an engineer at the Geological Exploration Department of the Mining Bureau, said: "All this should be attributed to Soviet expert Yuri Lev!" Sun Duojing, chief engineer of the Jiulonggang Coal Mine, said: "Soviet experts have brought youthful vitality to the Jiulonggang Coal Mine!" Now, the coal exploration work of the old mine is still in progress, and the workers are determined to find all the coal that was abandoned in the past to support the country's socialist industrialization construction.

    淮南矿务局认真贯彻苏联专家建议
    深入勘测找出大量被遗弃的煤层
    华东区淮南矿务局认真贯彻苏联专家建议，在九龙岗煤矿现有开采水平以上的局部地区，找到了过去被遗弃的一百多万吨煤。这些煤层的开采，将会充分发挥现有矿井的设备能力，延长矿井的寿命，并给国家节约大量的基本建设投资。
    九龙岗煤矿开采已有数十年之久。过去在日本帝国主义和国民党官僚资本掠夺式的开采下，好采的煤就采，不好采的就丢掉了，破坏了煤层开采的正规性和连续性，大量资源被遗弃在地下，缩短了矿井的使用期限。解放以后，该矿对生产矿井的地质工作没有重视，加以过去的资料残缺不全，一遇到断层就认为煤采完了，便要求延深矿井来开采深部的煤。今年四月间，中央人民政府燃料工业部副部长徐达本和苏联专家尤里列夫来到淮南煤矿，检查了老矿的图纸，发现许多煤层开采连续不上，有很多“空白区”。当时苏联专家就建议组织力量在这些“空白区”进行找煤的勘测工作，以延长矿井寿命，充分发挥现有矿井的设备能力，节约国家对矿井基本建设的投资。淮南矿务局接受苏联专家的建议，组织了一个“矿井地质工作组”进行这项工作。
    地质工作组的工人和技术人员，在进行这项工作中，克服了重重困难，发挥了高度的艰苦劳动的精神。七个多月来，他们走遍了所有能够进去的每一条巷道，勘测了三千二百多公尺的石门。为了把过去丢失的煤层全部找出来，他们把需要的岩石敲打下来，进行细密的研究分析。有些巷道因为年久失修或者已经报废，不能进去勘测，他们就召开老工人座谈会来搜集这方面的情况。然后做出计划，用巷探和钻探的办法，探清煤的埋藏量。到目前为止，在该矿现有开采水平以上的局部“空白地区”和过去认为的“无煤地带”，已找出了一百零二万九千吨煤。现在，地质工作组正在紧张地进行各种图表的绘制和编做地质报告，以便于生产部门及早确定开采计划。在苏联专家建议的启发下，该矿务局地质勘察处曾在九龙岗井田东部的境界线以外，用手摇钻进行小型的钻探，在距离地面七十多公尺深的地方，发现了一层二点一公尺厚的煤层，证明该矿东部原来的井田境界线已有变化，同时也批判了过去采煤只向纵深发展、放弃向两翼发展的盲目性。
    苏联专家的建议在生产中立即取得成效的事实，使淮南煤矿职工进一步认识到学习苏联先进经验和贯彻苏联专家建议，对加速国家的社会主义工业化建设的重大意义，鼓舞了全体职工为实现国家工业化而奋斗的热情。同时，他们由衷地感激苏联专家对淮南煤矿的帮助和指导。该矿务局地质勘察处工程师柴登榜说：“这一切都应归功于苏联专家尤里列夫！”九龙岗煤矿主管工程师孙多晶说：
  “苏联专家给九龙岗煤矿带来了青春的活力！”现在，老矿的找煤工作仍在继续进行，职工们决心把所有过去遗弃的煤都找出来，好支援国家的社会主义工业化建设。
