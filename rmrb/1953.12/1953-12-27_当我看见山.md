    When I See the Mountain
    Tieyifu Jiang·Ailiyoufu
    When I see the mountain,
    When I think of the mountain,
    Your figure immediately appears before me,
    I then yearn for your bravery,
    Seemingly seeing your heart and courage as vast as a mountain.
    The verdant pine forest growing on that mountain,
    Will not wither, evergreen in winter and summer,
    The verdant pine forest—truly like your pride,
    A symbol of the hope you cherish.
    Ah! Korean people with hearts and courage as vast as a mountain,
    The glory I feel for you,
    Is difficult to fully express even by writing hundreds and thousands of long poems,
    You will always be strong and young,
    Only the cold from the White House will be eradicated.
    (Translated by: Kelimu·Hejieyefu)
    Editor's Note: The author is a young poet of the Xinjiang Uyghur nationality, who recently participated in the Chinese People's Third Delegation to Korea for consolation activities. This poem was written by him during the consolation activities in Korea.

    当我看见山
    铁依甫江·艾里尤夫
    当我看见山，
    当我想起山，
    你的身影立刻出现在我的面前，
    我便思念起你的勇敢，
    似乎看见你那巨山般的心胆。
    生长在那山上的碧绿的松林，
    不会枯萎，冬夏长青，
    碧绿的松林——真像你的骄矜，
    你所怀念着的希望的象征。
    啊！具有巨山般心胆的朝鲜人民，
    我为你感到的光荣，
    就是写下千百篇长诗也难写尽，
    你永远会健壮年青，
    只有那从白宫侵袭来的寒冷将要绝根。
    （克里木·赫捷耶夫译）
    编者按：作者是新疆维吾尔族的年轻诗人，不久以前参加了中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团的慰问活动，这首诗就是他在朝鲜进行慰问中写的。
