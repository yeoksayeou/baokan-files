    "Material Responsible Person" Irresponsible for State Property
    A reader, Zhi Ming, writes: In early September, I went to a certain construction site of the First Construction Engineering Company directly under the Mengsui Construction Engineering Bureau and saw the material responsible person of this construction site directing several strong laborers to hammer hard blocks like greenstone, with several cement bags placed beside them. I immediately thought with regret: This is cement that has been damaged by moisture due to improper storage. However, the material responsible person seemed to "comfort" me by saying, "Not much cement is ruined. Our project needs so much cement, even grinding this little bit into powder and mixing it in won't be a problem." He then showed off his cleverness by saying, "This is not reported as a loss. If it's reported, it won't be counted in the project, and our company will suffer." I couldn't help but say, "If you use this bad cement, the state's project will suffer a great loss!" But he pretended not to hear me. Later, it was verified that the cement ruined by improper storage at this construction site included more than twenty bags that were congealed, more than 800 jin that were completely ineffective, and more than 500 jin that were partially ineffective. Regarding these losses of state property, the material responsible person thought it was "not much" and felt indifferent, and instead comforted others; and in order to avoid the responsibility for improper material storage, he even used the method of mixing bad cement to conceal the loss, completely disregarding whether the state's project would be damaged. It should be pointed out that this attitude is an irresponsible attitude towards state property.

### 对国家财产不负责的“材料负责人”

专栏：读者来信摘要

    对国家财产不负责的“材料负责人”
    读者之鸣来信：九月上旬，我到蒙绥建筑工程局直属第一建筑工程公司某工地去，看到这个工地的材料负责人正在指挥几个壮工锤打青石一样的硬块，旁边还放着几个水泥袋子。我立刻惋惜地想：这是水泥因保管不善而受了潮。但是，这位材料负责人好像“安慰”我似地说：“没有坏多少水泥。我们工程要用那么多水泥，把这一点锤成面儿掺到哪儿也不愁用。”他接着还卖弄聪明地说：“这个不报损失。报了就不算在工程里，我们公司要吃亏的。”我忍不住说：“用了这些坏水泥，国家的工程可要吃大亏！”但他却假装没听见我这句话。后来经查明，这个工地因保管不善而糟蹋的水泥，凝块的有二十多袋，完全失效的有八百多斤，半失效的有五百多斤。对于这些国家财产的损失，这位材料负责人认为“没有多少”，感到满不在乎，反而去安慰别人；而他为了使自己避免负保管材料不当的责任，更用掺用坏水泥的办法来匿报损失，而完全不考虑国家工程是否会受损害。应该指出，这种态度是对国家财产不负责的态度。
