The Story of Sanqiutian
    Li Shouyi

    This year, the rice harvest in Hujiajing Bay, Xishui County, Hubei Province, was abundant. When summarizing the experiences of the bumper harvest, people talked about the story of Sanqiutian.

    The story goes like this:

    In a place called "Jingwanlong," there were three terraced fields, one above the other.

    The top field, which could yield four stones and five dou of rice, belonged to Zhou Zhengxu, a farmer working independently. This field was only plowed at the end of the first month. When transplanting the seedlings, he only applied two loads of base fertilizer and transplanted them five days later than others. When others were weeding and applying top dressing, he only applied three jin of ammonium sulfate and considered it done. Later, the rice seedlings in the upper and lower fields grew very well, but the seedlings in his field were sparse and yellowish, making them unattractive. Others advised him to apply top dressing, but he always replied indifferently, "What's the point of top dressing? It's always been like this in the past." At harvest time, the field that should have yielded four stones and five dou of rice only produced one stone and eight dou of grain, and the ratooning shoots did not grow either.

    The middle field, which could yield four stones of rice, belonged to Hu Weichun, the deputy leader of the Jiang Bingjun mutual aid team. Usually, his other fields were very productive this year, with an average yield of 800 jin per mu; however, this field actually had a reduced yield.

    What was the reason for this? This year, Hu Weichun, in order to compete for "high-yield production" with the mutual aid team of Wang Yuqing, the branch secretary of the township, decided to set aside this four-stone field specifically as a "high-yield field." He applied as much fertilizer as possible to this field, including 260 loads of pond mud and 110 jin of cottonseed cake as base fertilizer. The fertilizer practically darkened the field. When weeding the first time, he applied five jin of gypsum, and when weeding the second time, he applied ten jin of ammonium sulfate as top dressing. At this time, the rice seedlings grew densely, and people standing on the edge of the field could not see the water. Passersby praised it. By the time of the third weeding, the dense rice seedlings had grown so thick that one could not put a foot in, but Hu Weichun, thinking of the "high-yield production," was worried and, further encouraged by the blind encouragement of the working comrades in the district, prompted him to apply the eighty jin of grass ash he had stored at home to the field.

    Originally, the fertilizer in this field was already sufficient, and the rice seedlings had not yet absorbed it all; now, with the addition of more fertilizer, the rice seedlings could not withstand it. By mid-June, the rice ears had not fully emerged and had all lodged. Although Hu Weichun anxiously drained the water from the field, the leaves of the rice plants were too thick, and the sun could not penetrate them. After a period of continuous rain, the inner layer of grain rotted and sprouted.

    At harvest time, there was a lot of straw, but little grain was harvested. The four-stone field only produced two stones of grain, and the empty husks weighed four or five dan. Because the top grain pods rotted, the ratooning shoots could not grow either. Hu Weichun regretted and said, "Originally, I applied more fertilizer to compete for high yield, but I didn't know that applying fertilizer improperly would cause me to lose the competition!"

    The lower field, which could yield five stones and six dou of rice, was Hu Weis’s “Maple Tree Field.” This year, this field achieved a bumper harvest. In the past, when Hu Weis did not participate in the mutual aid team, the crops in this field never grew well. This spring, after joining the mutual aid team, he applied 200 loads of old brick wall soil and 140 loads of grass clothing fertilizer to this field alone. He also used the "Victory Xian" rice variety and transplanted the seedlings on the same day as Hu Weichun. When weeding the first and second times, the rice seedlings in the field had already grown very well. At this time, based on the growth of the seedlings, he only applied 50 jin of rapeseed cake and eight jin of ash fertilizer as top dressing. He did not apply any top dressing when weeding the third time. At the end of June, when the rice grains were forming and drooping, he drained the water to allow them to be exposed to more sunlight. He harvested the rice in a timely manner, avoiding losses. This field not only produced six stones and eight dou of the first crop of grain but can also produce one stone and eight dou of ratooning shoots, which is an increase in production compared to last year.

    The story of Sanqiutian gave the farmers of Hujiajing Bay inspiration from the iron facts: if you want to grow crops well and produce more grain, you must apply fertilizer appropriately, neither applying too little nor applying too much. Now, Hu Weichun and Zhou Zhengxu also understand this principle. Hu Weichun excitedly said, "Next year, I will remember this lesson and make a good decision. Only by applying fertilizer according to the condition of the field can we produce more grain."

    三丘田的故事
    李守宜
    今年，湖北浠水县胡家井湾的稻谷丰收了。在总结丰收经验的时候，人们都谈起了三丘田的故事。
    故事是这样的：
    在名叫“井湾垅”的地方，上下共有三丘垅田。
    上头一丘四石五斗的田，是单干农民周正续的。这丘田一直挨到正月底才揭板。插秧时，只下了两担底肥，还比别人迟插了五天。别人在薅田施追肥，他却只上了三斤硫酸錏就算事。以后，上下田里的秧棵都长得很好，只有他这丘田的秧棵长得稀稀的，颜色黄得使人看不上眼。别人劝他施追肥，他总是若无其事地回答：“追么事！往年还不是这样。”到收割时，四石五斗的田只打了一石八斗谷子，秧荪也没有蓄起来。
    中间一丘四石的田，是江炳君互助组副组长胡为春的。本来今年他的一般的田都是丰产，每亩田产量平均达到了八百斤；可是，这丘田反而减了产。
    这究竟是什么道理呢？今年，胡为春为了争“高额丰产”，和本乡支部书记王雨青的互助组比赛，就决定把这四石田特别留出来作“丰产田”。他尽量往这块田里下肥料，光底肥下了塘泥二百六十担，棉饼一百一十斤。肥料简直把田都铺黑了。到了薅头道田时，他施了五斤石膏，薅二道时，又追了十斤硫酸錏。这时候秧棵长得密，人站在田岸上望不见水。过路的人看了都称羡。到了薅三道的时候，丛密的秧棵已经长得伸不进脚了，可是，胡为春想起了“高额丰产”的事，就放心不下，又加上区里工作同志的盲目鼓励，促使他把家里存的八十斤草木灰又上到田里。
    本来，这丘田的肥料已经够多，秧棵还没有把它吸收完；现在，再加肥料，秧棵就受不住了，到六月中旬，稻穗还没有出齐，就全部倒伏了。胡为春虽然着急地把田里的水放了，但因稻谷的部叶长得太厚，太阳透射不进去，落了一场连阴雨，里面的一层谷还是都浸烂生了芽。
    割谷时，草头倒很多，就是谷子打得少，四石田只打了二石谷，而瘪壳却有四、五担。因为头谷兜子烂了，秧荪也长不起来。胡为春后悔地说：“原来多施肥是为了比赛丰产，那知肥料上得不适当，反而比输了！”
    下面一丘五石六斗的田，是互助组员胡为四的“枫树丘”。今年，这丘田得到了丰产。往年，胡为四没有参加互助组时，这丘田的庄稼老是长得不好。今年春天，互助起来以后，他光在这丘田里就下了二百担陈壁砖土和一百四十担草衣；他也是用的“胜利籼”稻种，跟胡为春一天插的秧。在薅一、二道田时，田里的秧棵已经长得很好，这时他根据秧棵生长情况，只追了五十斤菜饼和八斤灰粪。到薅三道田时就没有追肥了。六月底，稻谷结实勾头的时候，他就把水放出，让它多受太阳照晒。他割谷也及时，避免了损失。这丘田除已打了六石八斗头谷外，还可以打一石八斗秧荪，比去年增了产。
    三丘田的故事，使胡家井湾的农民从铁的事实中得到了启示：要想种好庄稼，多打粮食，就要把肥料下得合适，既不能把肥料下少了，又不能下得过多。现在，胡为春和周正续也明白这番道理了，胡为春激动地说：“来年要记住这个教训，好好拿定主意，只有看田下肥料，才能多打粮食。”
