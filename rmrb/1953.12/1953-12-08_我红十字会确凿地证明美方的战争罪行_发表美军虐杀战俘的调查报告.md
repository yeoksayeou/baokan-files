    Our Red Cross Conclusively Proves American War Crimes
    Investigation Report on U.S. Military Atrocities Against Prisoners of War Published
    [This newspaper dispatch] The American military authorities, during the war of aggression against Korea, seriously violated the provisions of the Geneva Convention and the principles of international law by subjecting captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to all kinds of persecution, abuse, and slaughter. In order to uphold humanitarian principles and safeguard the Geneva Convention and the principles of international law, the Red Cross Society of China conducted a detailed investigation into the atrocities committed by the U.S. military against prisoners of war, and now publishes two documents: "Investigation Report on U.S. Military Atrocities Against Prisoners of War" and "Investigation Report on Medical Errors and Atrocities Committed by the U.S. Military Against Wounded and Sick Captured Personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in Korea" (the full text of both reports can be found on pages 4 to 8 of today's newspaper). These reports expose to the people of the world the shocking crimes of the American military authorities in abusing and slaughtering captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army based on the findings of the investigation.
   The "Investigation Report on U.S. Military Atrocities Against Prisoners of War" was written by the Red Cross Society of China after interviewing repatriated captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, listening to their accusations, and referring to the confessions of captured American airborne spies and other relevant materials, and after careful, repeated, and faithful verification. The report points out that, according to convincing materials, it has been confirmed that from November 1950 to July 1953, more than 2,600 captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army were brutally murdered by the U.S. military. Among them, more than 2,350 were individually or collectively massacred by the U.S. and Rhee armies on the battlefield because they had lost their combat effectiveness or because they were sick or wounded and had not been evacuated from the war zone in time; more than 240 have been identified as having been abused and murdered while detained in U.S. military prisoner-of-war camps, and more than 300 were beaten or maimed. In the atrocities of slaughtering captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the American military authorities not only used modern weapons such as bayonets, automatic rifles, carbines, light machine guns, 60mm mortars, grenades, poison gas bombs, flamethrowers, armored vehicles, and tanks, but also exhausted inhuman and brutal methods such as burning alive, "shooting at living targets," burying alive, tearing out hearts, and strangling. In addition to direct killings, the U.S. military authorities also subjected captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to illegal interrogations and illegal punishments, implemented life abuse and mental abuse, forced prisoners of war to engage in illegal labor and act as spies, and forcibly detained prisoners of war, committing countless crimes. As the investigation report states, the facts and evidence it lists, including thirty-seven attachments, irrefutably prove that "the U.S. military authorities' crimes of abusing and slaughtering prisoners of war are undoubtedly confirmed."
      The "Investigation Report on Medical Errors and Atrocities Committed by the U.S. Military Against Wounded and Sick Captured Personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in Korea" is a report by the Red Cross Society of China that specially hired experienced specialists and experts in various fields to conduct health investigations and research on repatriated captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The report is signed by Li Dequan, President of the Red Cross Society of China, and ten medical experts, including Zhang Xiaoqian, and every word is an irrefutable testimony. This report points out that among the 1,609 wounded and sick personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army who returned, 1,172 cases suffered from surgical diseases, 567 cases suffered from internal medicine diseases (225 people also suffered from both internal and surgical diseases), and 95 cases suffered from other diseases (including mental illness). Among the 1,172 surgical wounded, most were disabled to varying degrees because the U.S. side treated war wounds in violation of medical principles, delayed treatment, did not provide care, and deliberately amputated the limbs of the wounded; almost all 567 internal medicine patients suffered from chronic diseases, mainly chronic respiratory diseases, which were clearly the result of prolonged and extremely poor living conditions and cruel atrocities suffered in U.S. prisoner-of-war camps. Among the 1,609 returnees investigated in this report, almost everyone suffered one or more atrocities and persecutions during their captivity. U.S. military medical personnel not only did not try to reduce the suffering of the wounded and sick, but on the contrary, they directly assisted the U.S. military in carrying out torture to extract confessions, pursuing military intelligence, and forcibly detaining prisoners of war. As the report points out: "The wounds and disabilities of the wounded are ironclad evidence before us, and the U.S. side can no longer make any sophistry or denial."
    In an attempt to cover up the various cruel and barbaric atrocities committed by the U.S. military against captured personnel and civilians from Korea and China in Korea, the U.S. government has fabricated lies about the "atrocities" committed by the Korean and Chinese forces against UN forces prisoners of war and Korean civilians, and carried out shameless propaganda in an attempt to confuse the public. This is obviously futile. The two reports published by the Red Cross Society of China provide ironclad evidence that fully proves the monstrous crimes committed by the American aggressors in the Korean War.

### 我红十字会确凿地证明美方的战争罪行  发表美军虐杀战俘的调查报告

    我红十字会确凿地证明美方的战争罪行
    发表美军虐杀战俘的调查报告
    【本报讯】美国军事当局在侵略朝鲜战争中，严重地违反了日内瓦公约和国际公法原则的规定，对中国人民志愿军被俘人员进行了种种的迫害、虐待和屠杀。中国红十字会为了申张人道原则、维护日内瓦公约和国际公法原则，曾对美军虐杀战俘的暴行进行了详细的调查，现在发表了“美军虐杀战俘暴行调查报告书”和“调查美军在朝鲜对中国人民志愿军伤病被俘人员医疗错误及暴行报告书”两个文件（两个报告书全文见今日本报第四版至第八版），把调查所得的美国军事当局虐待和屠杀中国人民志愿军被俘人员的令人发指的罪行，公布于全世界人民面前。
   “美军虐杀战俘暴行调查报告书”，是中国红十字会向已被遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员进行访问，听取他们的控诉，又参照了已捕获的美军空降特务的供词，以及其他有关材料，经过了慎重的、反复的、忠实的对证之后写成的。该报告书指出，根据令人信服的材料，业已证实，自一九五○年十一月到一九五三年七月，被美军残杀的中国人民志愿军被俘人员共达二千六百多人。其中在战场上因失去战斗力或因病、伤未及撤离战区而被美李军队个别杀害或集体屠杀者共二千三百五十多人；在被拘禁于美军战俘营中而遭虐杀者，已经查明的就有二百四十多名，被打伤或弄成残废的共三百多名。美国军事当局在屠杀中国人民志愿军被俘人员的暴行中，不仅使用了刺刀、自动步枪、卡宾枪、轻机关枪、六○炮、手榴弹、毒气弹、火焰喷射器、装甲车、坦克等现代化武器，而且用尽火烧、“打活靶”、活埋、挖心、勒死等灭绝人性的残暴方法。除了直接屠杀外，美军当局并对中国人民志愿军被俘人员施以非法审讯和非法处罚、施行生活虐待和精神虐待，强迫战俘从事非法劳动和充当特务以及强迫扣留战俘等罄竹难书的罪行。正如调查书所说的，它所列举的事实和证据，包括三十七个附件，无可辩驳地证明了：“美国军事当局虐杀战俘的罪行是确凿无疑的”。
      “调查美军在朝鲜对中国人民志愿军伤病被俘人员医疗错误及暴行报告书”，是中国红十字会特聘富有经验的各专科医师和专家对遣返归来的中国人民志愿军被俘人员进行健康情况调查研究的报告。报告书上有中国红十字会会长李德全和医学专家张孝骞等十人的签署，其中每一个字都是无容辩驳的证言。这一报告书指出：在归来的一、六○九名中国人民志愿军伤病人员中，患外科疾病者有一、一七二例，患内科疾病（兼患内外科疾病者二二五人）有五六七例，患其他疾病（包括精神病）者有九五例。而在一、一七二名外科伤员中，大部分人是由于美方对于战伤进行违反医学原则的处理，拖延治疗，不加护理，故意截断伤员肢体等，而成了不同程度的残废；五六七名内科病员几乎全是慢性病患者，主要是患有慢性呼吸系疾患，这显然是他们在美方战俘营中长期遭受极端恶劣的生活待遇以及残酷暴行的迫害的结果。这报告书所调查的一千六百零九名归来人员中，几乎每人都在被俘期中遭受过一次或数次的暴行迫害。美军的医务人员不仅不设法减少伤病员的痛苦，相反地，他们竟直接协助美军对战俘施行肉刑迫供、追索军事情报和强迫扣留战俘等暴行。正如报告书所指出的：“伤员的伤痕和残废是铁一般的证据摆在面前，美方是无法再作任何狡辩抵赖的。”
    美国政府为了企图掩饰美军在朝鲜对朝中被俘人员和平民所犯的各种残酷野蛮的暴行，竟然捏造所谓朝中部队对联合国军战俘和朝鲜平民施行“暴行”的谎言，进行无耻的宣传，以图混淆视听，这显然是徒然的。中国红十字会所发表的这两个报告书，提出了铁一般的证据，充分可以判定美国侵略者在朝鲜战争中所犯的滔天罪行。
