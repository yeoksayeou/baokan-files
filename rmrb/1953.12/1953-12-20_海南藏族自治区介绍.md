    The Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Region is located south of Qinghai Lake, China's largest inland lake, and is an autonomous region equivalent to a special district. It governs five counties: Gonghe, Xinghai, Guide, Guinan, and Tongde. Except for Guide County, all are pastoral areas primarily engaged in animal husbandry. The region covers an area of approximately 90,000 square kilometers and is inhabited by seven ethnic groups, including Tibetan, Han, Hui, Mongolian, Kazakh, Salar, and Tu, with a population of approximately 100,000, over 70% of whom are Tibetan. The autonomous region is bordered by the Bayan Har Mountains and the Jishi Mountains to the south, and connected to the Qinghai agricultural area across the Riyue Mountain to the north. The Yellow River flows through the autonomous region, and along its banks are vast primeval forests. Between the mountains and rivers lie expansive and fertile grasslands. The entire autonomous region has over two million livestock of various kinds, producing nearly three million jin of wool annually. It also produces valuable medicinal materials such as pilose antler, musk, and caterpillar fungus.
    In the past, the Ma Bufang bandit gang, in order to rule and plunder the people of the pastoral areas, first attacked the herders in this region. Ma's cruel economic blockade policy severed economic ties between the pastoral and agricultural areas and created numerous disputes within the Hainan Tibetan community and among various ethnic groups. This led to a gradual decline in animal husbandry production in the pastoral areas and increasingly impoverished lives for the herders. In early 1950, after the work cadres of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government entered the Hainan region, tribal leaders and herders urgently requested the People's Government to mediate disputes, stop tribal feuds, and stabilize social order. The work cadres of the People's Government, uniting local tribes and leaders of various monasteries who were connected to the masses, mediated over 4,760 large and small disputes in four years, laying the foundation for the development of various construction undertakings in the Hainan Tibetan area.
    From 1951 to 1952, the autonomous regions of Tongde, Gonghe, and Xinghai counties were established successively. The vast majority of tribal leaders and leaders of various monasteries who were connected to the masses participated in the work of the People's Government. The People's Governments of each county attached importance to training ethnic minority cadres. The entire region now has 425 ethnic minority cadres, among whom ethnic minority cadres in Tongde County account for 48% of the total number of cadres in the county. Ethnic minority cadres participating in the work of the People's Government have fully demonstrated their initiative as masters of their own affairs in their work. For example, Dan De'er, chairman of the Tongde County Tibetan Autonomous Region People's Government, visited the Xiarang and Gonggongma tribes in April this year, leading and helping the herders to formulate plans for this year's animal husbandry production.
    The Hainan Tibetan area is gradually changing its old appearance. In the past four years, the total number of livestock in the region has increased by an average of over 70%. Many tribes have established livestock protection committee organizations to lead herders in activities such as wolf extermination, fire prevention, and grassland protection. Herders have also begun to adopt advanced livestock feeding and management methods such as grass storage and fencing. The People's Governments of each county have issued a large amount of livestock loans to help impoverished herders develop production and establish households. This year, the entire autonomous region has issued a total of 2.56 billion yuan in livestock loans. In Tongde County alone, 500 herder households with no or few livestock have received means of production and living.
    Under the People's Government's policy of developing trade in the pastoral areas, the autonomous region's trade has seen new development. State-owned trading organizations and cooperative county federations have been established in each county of the Hainan region. According to transaction statistics from Guide market, the trade center of the pastoral area, nearly four million jin of wool and over 246,000 various hides were exported in 1951 and 1952 alone, while over 32,700 bolts of cloth, over 45,000 packages of Fuzhuan tea, over three million jin of grain, and nearly 6 billion yuan worth of general merchandise and silk were imported. This year, construction is underway in Gaba Sundu and Laji Monastery in Tongde County, Huangqungou in Xinghai County, and Qia Buqia and Daotanghe in Gonghe County. Rows of neat houses have appeared on the vast grasslands. These places will gradually become the political, economic, and cultural centers of the pastoral area.
    With the gradual development of the economy, the autonomous region's cultural and educational undertakings have also developed. The entire Hainan Tibetan area now has one middle school, nine complete primary schools, and seventy junior primary schools. In Xinghai, Tongde, and Gonghe counties alone, there are over 2,400 children attending school. This year, the People's Government has begun work to eradicate venereal diseases in the Hainan region, and over 6,000 people in Gonghe County have received treatment.

    海南藏族自治区介绍
    新华社记者  侯毅、彭雪、马振国
    海南藏族自治区位于我国最大的内陆湖——青海湖的南面，是相当于专区级的自治区。辖共和、兴海、贵德、贵南、同德五县，除贵德县外都是以畜牧业生产为主的畜牧区。全区面积约九万平方公里，有藏、汉、回、蒙、哈萨克、撒拉、土等七个民族，人口约十万人，百分之七十以上是藏族。自治区南面是巴颜喀喇山和积石山，北面隔着日月山和青海农业区相连。黄河流经自治区，黄河两岸，有广大的原始森林区，在山峦与河流之间，分布着辽阔肥沃的草原。全自治区共有各种牲畜二百多万只，每年出产羊毛近三百万斤。这里还出产鹿茸、麝香、虫草等名贵药材。
    过去，马步芳匪帮为了统治和掠夺牧业区人民，首先就向这个地区的牧民进攻。马匪残酷的经济封锁政策，曾断绝了牧业区和农业区的经济联系；并在海南藏族内部和各民族之间制造了许多纠纷。因此，使牧业区的畜牧业生产日趋衰落，牧民生活日益穷困。一九五零年初，中国共产党和人民政府的工作干部进入海南地区后，各部落的头人和牧民，迫切要求人民政府调解纠纷、停止部落间的械斗和安定社会秩序。人民政府的工作干部，团结当地各部落和各寺院中与人民群众有联系的领袖人物，在四年中调解了各种大、小纠纷四千七百六十多件，奠定了海南藏区各项建设事业的发展基础。
    一九五一年到一九五二年，同德、共和、兴海三县先后建立了自治区，各部落和各寺院中与群众有联系的领袖人物，绝大多数都参加了人民政府工作。各县人民政府重视培养民族干部。全区现有民族干部四百二十五名，其中同德县的民族干部已占全县干部总数的百分之四十八。参加人民政府工作的民族干部，在工作中充分发挥了当家作主的积极性。如同德县藏族自治区人民政府主席丹德尔，今年四月曾到夏卜让、贡公麻两个部落，领导和帮助牧民订出今年畜牧业生产的计划。
    海南藏区在逐步改变着旧日的面貌。四年来全区各种牲畜平均增殖了百分之七十以上。许多部落建立了保畜委员会的组织，领导牧民进行打狼、防火和保护草原等工作。牧民们并开始接受储草、打圈等先进的牲畜饲放管理方法。各县人民政府发放了大量畜牧贷款，帮助贫苦牧民发展生产建立家务。今年全自治区共发放畜牧贷款二十五亿六千万元。仅同德一县就有五百户无畜和少畜的牧民，获得了生产资料和生活资料。
    在人民政府发展牧业区的贸易政策下，自治区的贸易事业有了新的发展。海南地区各县都已建立了国营贸易机构和合作社县联社。据牧业区贸易中心贵德市场的交易统计，仅一九五一年和一九五二年两年中，就输出羊毛近四百万斤，各种皮张二十四万六千多张；输入各种布三万二千七百多匹，茯茶四万五千多封，粮食三百多万斤，以及价值近六十亿元的百货和绸缎。今年，在同德县的尕巴孙都、拉加寺，兴海县的黄群沟，共和县的恰卜恰、倒淌河等地，都在进行修建，一排排整齐的房屋，已出现在辽阔的草原上。这些地方将逐渐成为牧业区政治、经济、文化的中心。
    随着经济的逐步发展，自治区的文教事业也有了发展。全海南藏区已有一所中学、九所完全小学和七十所初级小学。仅兴海、同德、共和三县上学的儿童就有二千四百多名。今年，人民政府已在海南地区开始根治性病的工作，共和县已有六千多人受到了治疗。
