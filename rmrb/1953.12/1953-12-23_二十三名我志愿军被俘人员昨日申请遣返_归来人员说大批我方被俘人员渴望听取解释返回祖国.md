Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 22nd: Today, the Korean-Chinese side continued to provide explanations to the 231 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who had not yet received explanations at Camp No. 3 in Dongchang-ri. Despite the terroristic influence and various interferences by the US side, 23 POWs bravely applied for repatriation on the spot and returned to Kaesong tonight. Adding to the 33 who applied for repatriation yesterday, a total of 56 POWs from Camp No. 3 have applied for repatriation after hearing the explanation once.

As yesterday, some POWs in the tents, in front of our explanation representatives and neutral nations personnel, angrily denounced the US plot and atrocities of forcibly detaining POWs, making the American "psychological warfare" experts and Kuomintang secret agents, sitting in the tents under the guise of US representatives, very embarrassed. Outside the tents, the US propaganda machine dared not say much either; they tried to avoid discussing the results of the explanation, because this result had once again dealt them a heavy blow.

Because more than 30 POWs requested repatriation during yesterday's explanation, the US side today further strengthened its threats and control over the POWs listening to the explanation. During today's explanation process, the sound of US aircraft engines and shell explosions constantly came from south of the Demilitarized Zone. The Kuomintang secret agents under the command of the US in Camp No. 3 clearly conducted new threats to the POWs listening to the explanation today. Many POWs looked pale and uneasy when entering the tents. After entering the tents, some POWs were forced to block their ears with their hands or turn their backs to our explanation representatives, chanting like scriptures: "Return to Taiwan," according to the orders of the secret agents. Whenever a loud explosion was heard, the POWs hysterically said: "I don't want to be repatriated, I don't want to be repatriated...", and cast fearful glances at the US representatives present.

Those Kuomintang secret agents whom the Korean-Chinese side requested the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to expel yesterday still appeared in the explanation tents today as US representatives or translators. Zhang Bi, the Kuomintang secret agent who acted as a US observer representative in explanation tent No. 24 yesterday, appeared in explanation tent No. 3 today. The secret agent surnamed Ma, who was in explanation tent No. 3 yesterday, changed to tent No. 24 today. The secret agent surnamed Wang, who acted as a US translator in tent No. 8 yesterday, became a US observer representative today, while the secret agent surnamed Jin, who was a US observer representative yesterday, became a translator today. These US representatives and translators continued to threaten the POWs with nodding, winking, speaking, and clamoring, making the POWs afraid to apply for repatriation. In tent No. 5, the US representative kept nodding to a POW, and the Kuomintang "translator" deliberately translated the door for not applying for repatriation as "the door to Taiwan." They were warned by the Indian chairman.

A pale young POW, after entering the tent, convulsed as soon as he saw the US representative staring at him sternly, saying: "Return to Taiwan." Our explanation representative told him that no one in the tent could threaten him anymore, and the POW calmed down. When the explanation representative described that many people from Camp No. 3 had returned to Kaesong yesterday and were living free and happy lives again, the POW supported his cheeks with his hands and listened intently. Finally, he told the explanation representative: "I want to return to the motherland," and hurried to the tent waiting for repatriation.

Another POW, after entering tent No. 11, had no expression on his face and only said what the secret agents forced him to say: "I'm not going back." The explanation representative kindly said to him: "The people of the motherland sympathize with your experiences and know that you are living a miserable life in the POW camp. You are not getting enough to eat or wear, and you are often beaten and scolded..." The POW suddenly sobbed, and his head drooped lower and lower. He whispered to the explanation representative: "I know that not being repatriated means certain death, but they (the secret agents) say that being repatriated will also lead to being beaten to death!" The explanation representative told him that there was no danger anymore, but the POW still dared not believe it immediately. Finally, he excitedly said to the explanation representative: "Even if I die, I want to go back!" He immediately walked out of the door for applying for repatriation. Some POWs angrily denounced the various crimes of the US-Chiang secret agents in forcibly detaining POWs in the explanation tents today. In tent No. 16, a POW said to the personnel of the neutral nations subsidiary organ and the explanation representative: "In the POW camp, I was forced to be a teacher at the so-called CIE 'school.' I know that the secret agents have always maintained contact with the Americans. The Kuomintang secret agents outside the camp also specially organized a committee to communicate with the inside of the camp through the hospital using codes." The POW also said: "I know that many people are willing to be repatriated, but they are afraid of being beaten to death by the secret agents, so they dare not express their willingness. I demand that the explanation time must be extended in order to rescue them!" In tent No. 32, a POW angrily pointed at the Taiwan Kuomintang secret agent acting as a "representative of the detaining party" and said: "You are a secret agent! You are the ones who sent secret agent 'teachers' in and gave them knives and sticks to massacre POWs and tattoo words on me. What are you doing sitting here?" The secret agent who was identified looked very embarrassed.

A POW whose arm was crippled by secret agents exposed the scars on his body to the neutral nations personnel and said: "During the 'screening' at '48,' the secret agents didn't let me return to the country and beat me like this!" Another disabled POW also complained in the tent that he was crippled by secret agents not long ago. In tent No. 23, a POW in his forties with a Shandong accent said to the neutral nations personnel: "During the 'screening' last year, the secret agents said that anyone who wanted to return to the country could go back, but as soon as I reached the gate, I was severely beaten by the secret agents. I also personally saw the Americans beat seven POWs to death and even took pictures! Although the Americans and secret agents tattooed so many words on me and threatened to cut me to death even if they only cut the words off, I would rather be cut to death than go home!" When our translator translated these words to the neutral nations personnel, a US representative named Finnigan lost control and said to our translator like a hooligan: "You kid, be careful!"

The captured personnel who applied for repatriation after the explanation said that a large number of our captured personnel are eager to return to the embrace of the motherland, and they have every reason to demand that the 90-day explanation period be supplemented so that they can have the opportunity to listen to the explanation and exercise their right to repatriation. The US stubbornly opposes supplementing the explanation time in order to fundamentally deprive the POWs of this right and to forcibly detain the POWs.

The Korean-Chinese side put forward this morning the plan to explain to 250 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war in Camp No. 4 tomorrow and requested the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to make specific arrangements for the explanation work.

    二十三名我志愿军被俘人员昨日申请遣返
    归来人员说大批我方被俘人员渴望听取解释返回祖国
    【新华社开城二十二日电】今天朝中方面继续对东场里第三号营场尚未听过解释的二百三十一名中国人民志愿军被俘人员进行解释。虽然在美方的恐怖影响与种种干扰下，仍有二十三名战俘勇敢地当场申请遣返，并已在今天晚上回到开城。加上昨天申请遣返的三十三人，第三号营场的战俘在听过一次解释以后已共有五十六人申请遣返归来。
    和昨天一样，有些战俘在帐篷中，在我方解释代表和中立国人员面前，激愤地控诉了美方强迫扣留战俘的阴谋和暴行，使以美方代表名义坐在帐篷里的美国“心理战”专家和国民党特务十分狼狈。在帐篷以外，美方宣传机器也不敢多说话了，它们都竭力避免谈论解释的结果，因为这个结果又一次使它们遭到了沉重的打击。
    由于昨天解释中有三十多名战俘要求遣返，美方今日更加强了对听取解释的战俘的威胁和控制。在今天解释过程中，从非军事区以南不断传来美方飞机的马达声响和炮弹爆炸声。第三号营场中美方指挥下的国民党特务显然对今日听取解释的战俘也进行了新的威胁。有很多战俘在进入帐篷时，都面色苍白，惶惶不安。进入帐篷后，有些战俘就被迫按着特务的命令用双手堵上耳朵，或者把背对着我方解释代表，像念经似的说：“回台湾”。每当一声巨大的爆炸声传来时，战俘就歇斯底里地说：
  “我不遣返，不遣返……”，并且用恐惧的眼光瞥视在场的美方代表。
    朝中方面昨天要求中立国遣返委员会将其驱逐出去的那些国民党特务，今天仍以美方代表或翻译身份出现在解释帐篷里。昨天在二十四号解释帐篷内充作美方观察代表的国民党特务张弼今天出现在三号解释帐篷中。昨天在三号解释帐篷中的姓马的特务今天换到二十四号帐篷。昨天在第八号帐篷充作美方翻译的姓王的特务今天变成了美方观察代表，昨天当美方观察代表的姓金的特务今天则变成了翻译。这些美方代表和翻译今日继续用点头、使眼色、讲话、喧嚷等手段威胁战俘，使战俘不敢申请遣返。在第五号帐篷，美方代表对一个战俘不断地点头，国民党“翻译”也故意把不申请遣返的门译成“去台湾的门”。他们受到了印度主席的警告。
    有一个脸色苍白的年青的战俘在进入帐篷后，刚一看见严厉地盯着他的美方代表，就痉癴地说：
  “回台湾”。我方解释代表告诉他，在帐篷中已经没有人可以威胁他，这个战俘才安静下来。当解释代表叙述昨天第三号营场已有很多人回到开城，重新过到自由幸福的生活时，这个战俘就用手托着两腮，凝神地静听着。最后，他告诉解释代表说：
  “我要回祖国”，并急忙向等待遣返的帐篷跑去。
    另一个战俘在进入十一号帐篷后，面部毫无表情，只是按照特务强迫他说的话说：“我不回去。”解释代表亲切地对他说：“祖国人民都很同情你们的遭遇，知道你们在战俘营里过着悲惨的生活。吃不饱、穿不暖，还经常挨打、受骂……。”这个战俘突然唏嘘起来，头也越垂越低。他低声对解释代表说：“我知道不遣返只有死路一条，但他们（特务）说要遣返也会被打死！”解释代表告诉他已没有任何危险，这个战俘还是不敢立即相信，最后，他才激动地对解释代表说：“就是死，我也要回去！”他立即从申请遣返的门走了出去。一些战俘今天在解释帐篷里愤怒地控诉了美蒋特务强迫扣留战俘的种种罪行。在十六号帐篷，一个战俘对中立国附属机构人员和解释代表说：“在战俘营里，我被迫当过所谓CIE‘学校’的教员，我知道特务一直和美国人保持联系。营场外的国民党特务还专门组织了一个委员会，通过医院，用密码和营场内联络。”这个战俘还说：“我知道有很多人都是愿意遣返的，但是由于怕被特务打死，不敢表示他们的意愿。我要求一定要延长解释时间，才能把他们救出来！”在三十二号帐篷，一个战俘愤怒地指着充当“拘留一方代表”的台湾国民党特务说：“你是个特务！就是你们派特务‘老师’进来，还发给他们刀子、棍子，让他们屠杀战俘，在我身上刺字，你坐在这里干什么？”这个被指认出来的特务显出很窘的样子。
    一个臂膀被特务分子打残废了的战俘露出身上的伤痕对中立国人员说：“在‘四八’甄别时，特务们不让我回国，就把我打成这个样子！”另一个残废的战俘也在帐篷里控诉说，他是在不久以前被特务打成残废的。第二十三号帐篷，一个四十多岁、山东口音的战俘对中立国人员说：“去年‘甄别’时，特务们说谁要回国就可以回去，但我刚到大门口，就遭到特务们一顿毒打。我还亲眼看见美国人把七个战俘打死，还照了相！尽管美国人和特务在我身上刺了这么多字，并威胁说光割字也会把我割死，但我宁愿割死也要回家！”当我方翻译人员把这些话译给中立国人员听时，一个名叫斐尼甘的美方代表竟失去自制，像流氓一样对我方翻译说：“你这小子，要当心点！”
    经解释后申请遣返归来的被俘人员说，大批我方被俘人员渴望回到祖国怀抱，他们完全有理由要求补足九十天的解释时间，以使他们获得听解释行使遣返权利的机会。美方顽固地反对补足解释时间，就是为了根本剥夺战俘的这项权利，为了强迫扣留战俘。
    朝中方面今天上午提出了明天向第四号营场的二百五十名中国人民志愿军被俘人员解释的计划，要求中立国遣返委员会作解释工作的具体安排。
