    Sichuan and Jiangsu Provinces Pilot Handicraft Production Cooperatives; Contracts Signed with Rural Supply and Marketing Cooperatives to Manufacture Farm Tools
    Sichuan Province has been focusing on piloting handicraft production cooperatives, and the number has reached 208, with more than 6,300 members. After these cooperatives were organized, under the leadership and assistance of the local Communist Party committees and People's Governments, they generally paid attention to ensuring that the quality and specifications of the products could meet the needs of farmers and promote new farming technologies, so that production could be developed.
    In order to strengthen the leadership of the pilot industrial production cooperatives, 52 counties and cities including Chengdu and Nanchong have equipped more than 260 full-time cadres to lead the industrial production cooperatives, guiding each cooperative to carry out production according to the characteristics of complex handicraft production technology, diverse specifications, and large regional and seasonal variations. When the CPC Wenjiang County Committee piloted a farm tool production cooperative in Chengguan, it mobilized members to deeply understand the needs of farmers, corrected the past tendency of forcing uniform specifications, established a product inspection system, and implemented "guaranteed repair, guaranteed use, and guaranteed adjustment" for customers, which enabled the cooperative to quickly eliminate defective products and improve its reputation. After correcting the tendency of not paying attention to the diversity of farm tools, the Chengguan Farm Tool Production Cooperative in Chongqing County signed a "Farm Tool Contract" with the rural supply and marketing cooperatives in the county's seven districts, and produced according to the quantity, quality, and specifications stipulated in the contract. More than 10,000 farm tools have been manufactured to meet the needs of farmers, including more than 4,000 rice harrows suitable for farmers to use in dense rice planting.
    Because the local Communist Party committees and People's Governments have strengthened the leadership of the industrial production cooperatives, the industrial production cooperatives have improved their business management, improved production efficiency, and gradually developed production. Now 70% of the cooperatives have surpluses and have accumulated public funds. With the development of production, some industrial production cooperatives have bought machines and are carrying out semi-mechanized production. The income of the members of the industrial production cooperatives has also increased significantly. The Chengdu Cloth Shoe Production Cooperative now has a monthly income per person that is 50% higher than that of ordinary handicraftsmen in the local area, and the cooperative also has simple medical equipment and a small library. The members also participated in spare-time cultural literacy schools.
    Jiangsu Province has been focusing on piloting 261 handicraft production cooperatives, of which cotton knitting and iron and wood industries account for 85%, and more than 41,000 members have been organized. Under the leadership and assistance of the superior cooperatives, these handicraft production cooperatives often investigate and study the needs of farmers, and carry out production according to the different regions and the complexity of handicraft production technology. The Liuhe County Iron and Wood Production Cooperative decided to produce in a mobile manner, mainly going to market towns to produce, to serve agricultural production, and to pay attention to serving urban basic construction. The members of the Juxing Iron and Wood Production Cooperative in Haimen County listened to the opinions of farmers on the required farm tools after going deep into the mutual aid groups, improved the quality and specifications of the farm tools, and guaranteed replacement, return, and use. They signed a farm tool supply contract with the local supply and marketing cooperative, and produced according to the quantity, quality, and specifications stipulated in the contract in a planned way.
    Due to the development of production, the Jiangsu Provincial Production Cooperative has accumulated more than 10 billion yuan this year. Some production cooperatives have added machines and implemented semi-mechanized production. The material and cultural life of the members has also been correspondingly improved. The No. 1 Cotton Cloth Production Cooperative in the Fourth District of Nanjing has added 30 electric motors, and the monthly wage income of each member has increased to 500,000 to 600,000 yuan. Many members have entered spare-time cultural schools to study. (Xinhua News Agency)

    四川江苏两省试办手工业生产合作社
    和农村供销合作社订立合同制造农具
    四川省重点试办的手工业生产合作社已达二百零八个，共有社员六千三百多人。这些合作社组织起来后，在当地中共党委和人民政府领导帮助下，大都注意了产品的质量、规格能适应农民使用称心和推广新农作技术的需要，使生产得到发展。
    为了加强对试办工业生产合作社的领导，成都、南充等五十二个县、市配备了领导工业生产合作社的专职干部二百六十多人，领导各社根据手工业生产技术复杂、规格繁多、地区性和季节性大等特点进行生产。中共温江县委会在城关试办农具生产合作社时，发动社员深入了解农民需要，纠正过去强求规格划一的偏向，建立产品检验制，对顾客实行“包修、包用、包调”，使该社迅速消灭了次品，提高了信誉。崇庆县城关农具生产合作社纠正不重视农具多样性的偏向后，和该县七个区的农村供销合作社订立“农具合同”，根据合同规定的数量、质量、规格进行生产，已制造的一万多件农具都适合农民需要，其中有四千多把秧耙适合农民用于水稻密植的需要。
    由于各地中共党委和人民政府加强了对工业生产合作社的领导，使工业生产合作社改善了经营管理，提高了生产效率，逐步发展了生产。现在已有百分之七十的社有盈余，并积累了公积金。随着生产的发展，有的工业生产合作社已买了机器，进行半机器生产。各工业生产合作社社员收入也显著增加。成都市布鞋生产合作社现在每人每月收入比当地一般手工业者高百分之五十强，社内并有简单的医药设备和小型图书馆，社员们还参加了业余文化补习学校学习。
    江苏省重点试办的手工业生产合作社已有二百六十一个，其中棉针织、铁木业占百分之八十五，组织起来的社员共有四万一千多人。这些手工业生产合作社，在上级社的领导帮助下，经常调查研究农民的需要，根据地区不同，手工业生产技术的复杂性等情况进行生产。六合县铁木业生产合作社决定流动生产，主要是到集镇去生产，为农业生产服务，并注意为城市基本建设服务。海门县聚星铁木业生产合作社的社员深入互助组听取农民对需要的农具的意见后，改进农具质量、规格，并保证包换、包退和包用。他们和当地供销合作社订立农具供应合同，根据合同规定的数量、质量和规格有计划地生产。
    由于生产的发展，江苏省生产合作社今年已聚积一百多亿元。有些生产合作社已添置机器，实行半机械化生产。社员物质、文化生活也得到相应的改善。南京四区棉布第一生产合作社添置三十台电动机，每个社员每月工资收入增至五、六十万元，很多社员已进了业余文化学校读书。　（新华社）
