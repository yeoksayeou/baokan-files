Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, 1st. This winter's Huai River project has successively commenced in mid-November. In addition to the Boshan Reservoir project in the upper reaches and the Foziling Reservoir project in the middle reaches, which did not stop during this year's flood season and continue to be constructed, the projects that have already started include: the Hong River regulation project and the Ying River regulation project in Henan; the North Fei River drainage project, the Huai River main and tributary diversion project, and the Fengshan slope protection project in Anhui. The total earthwork to be done is approximately over 20 million cubic meters. The Boshan Reservoir project is about to complete the lining project of the water conveyance tunnel and enter the third phase of construction. The Foziling Reservoir project is speeding up preparations for winter concrete pouring. The foundation clearing project for the eastern half of the reservoir arch dam was basically completed in mid-November, and the concrete pouring project was started twelve days ahead of schedule. The buttress walls on the western half of the arch dam have all reached the top, and the arch surface is now being poured continuously.

Currently, large numbers of migrant worker teams have arrived at various construction sites. Soon after arriving at the embankments, the migrant workers plunged into the production increase and economy campaign, changing the phenomenon of "chaos for the first three days of work" and rapidly improving work efficiency. In the North Fei River drainage project, which started construction earlier, the average efficiency of migrant workers excavating the Fei Xie diversion canal reached 1.5 cubic meters, with a maximum of 2.23 cubic meters. By mid-November, this project had completed 15 percent of its winter tasks.

The various materials and equipment, grain, and fuel needed for this winter's Huai River project have been prepared for over four months, overcoming difficulties in procurement and transportation. They have now been transported to the construction sites, ensuring the timely commencement of the winter project. Over 10,000 tons of cement, as well as large quantities of steel bars, steel materials, timber, generators, various fuels, etc., required for the Boshan Reservoir project and the Foziling Reservoir project, have been successively transported to the construction sites from Tianjin, Tangshan, Hankou, Shanghai, Longtan and other places. More than 500 dump trucks, more than ten kilometers of narrow-gauge railway tracks, and more than 5,000 iron shovels required for the Tong River Dam project of the Huai River main and tributary diversion project in the middle reaches have been transferred to the construction site from completed construction sites. Tens of millions of catties of grain and fuel needed at each construction site have also been transported to the construction site from all directions, ensuring the needs of workers and migrant workers' lives.

Currently, production increase and economy work teams led by responsible comrades from various departments of the Huai River Management Committee have gone to key construction sites to inspect the development of the production increase and economy campaign and the construction situation.

    今年冬季治淮工程已陆续开工
    【新华社蚌埠一日电】今年冬季治淮工程已在十一月中旬陆续开工。除今年汛期未停工的上游薄山水库工程和中游佛子岭水库工程继续施工外，已经开工的有：河南的洪河整理工程，颍河整理工程，安徽的北淝河除涝工程，淮河干支流分流工程和峰山护坡等工程，总共要做土方工程约有两千多万公方。薄山水库工程即将完成输水道衬砌工程转入第三期施工。佛子岭水库工程，正加紧进行冬季浇筑混凝土的准备。水库连拱坝东半部的清理基础工程，在十一月中旬已基本结束；并提前十二天作浇筑混凝土的工程。连拱坝西半部的垛墙已全部到顶，现正继续浇筑拱面。
    现在，大批民工队已经抵达各工地。民工们上堤不久，便投入增产节约运动，改变了“初上工三天乱”的现象，工作效率迅速提高。施工较早的北淝河除涝工程中，开挖淝澥引河的民工平均效率达一点五公方，最高达二点二三公方。到十一月中旬，这项工程已完成冬季任务的百分之十五。
    今年冬季治淮工程中所需要的各种器材和粮食、燃料等，经四个多月的筹备，克服了采购和运输中的困难，现在已运抵工地，保证了冬季工程得以及时开工。薄山水库工程、佛子岭水库工程所需用的一万多吨水泥，及大量的钢筋、钢料、木料、发电机、各种油料等，已从天津、唐山、汉口、上海、龙潭等地陆续运往工地。中游淮河干流支流分流工程的潼河拦河坝工程所需用的五百多辆斗车，十多公里的轻便铁轨，五千多把铁锹，已经从已完工的工地上调运到工地。各工地上所需用的数千万斤粮食和燃料也已从四面八方运往工地，保证了工人、民工生活上的需要。
    现在，由治淮委员会各部门负责同志率领的增产节约工作组已分赴各重点工地检查开展增产节约运动和施工情况。
