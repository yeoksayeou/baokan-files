The Tianzhuang Village Agricultural Producers' Cooperative and mutual aid teams in Zunhua County, Hebei Province, enthusiastically support the general line. Since December 10th, the entire village has mobilized all its carts and horses, beating drums and gongs, and vying with each other to sell surplus grain to the state.

Tianzhuang Village has a total of 132 households. Under the leadership of the Party, the entire village organized in the winter of 1951, establishing an agricultural producers' cooperative and eleven mutual aid teams. Over the past two years, they have overcome the difficulties that could not be overcome by decentralized management, increasing land yields from 120-130 jin per mu to 330-830 jin, ensuring that every family has enough food and clothing, and changing the state of poverty in the past. Recently, after launching the study of the general line among the masses, the masses' awareness has been further enhanced, and they all realize that selling surplus grain to the state is for their own future happiness and is a glorious obligation of the peasants. Wang Baoxiang, the 61-year-old head of a mutual aid team, said after studying the general line: "If we want to enter socialism a few years earlier, we must sell surplus grain to the state so that the state can build more factories and make more farming machines for us." After holding a family meeting, cooperative member Hu Yuwen decided to sell ten shi of surplus grain to the state. On December 8th, he first sent the threshed corn and japonica rice to the supply and marketing cooperative. The propagandist immediately broadcast the news, and the broad masses of cooperative members responded enthusiastically. Some went to the cooperative affairs committee to discuss; Liu Yong and his wife, who had not prepared the grain, rushed to thresh corn overnight. The Party branch and the members of the agricultural producers' cooperative, in order to satisfy the wishes of the cooperative members, went to various households to understand the situation, and at the cooperative affairs committee, based on the cooperative members' grain sales preparations, decided to collectively send seven carts of grain on the 10th first. The news that the agricultural producers' cooperative was collectively selling grain also affected the mutual aid teams. Dong Wanquan, the head of a mutual aid team, mobilized the members of his team, saying: "We haven't surpassed the cooperative in patriotic production increase, but we can't lag behind in patriotic grain sales." He asked someone to help thresh corn overnight, and the next day, before the sun had risen, their team had already loaded two large carts of grain. Their patriotic exemplary actions were praised. The Zunhua County Committee of the Communist Party of China and the County People's Government sent representatives to Tianzhuang to award Tianzhuang Village and Guo Lan Agricultural Producers' Cooperative two banners of "Patriotic Production Increase and Grain Sales Model."

At a mass meeting of the entire village, eleven mutual aid teams expressed that they would learn from the cooperative and sell grain to support national construction, and immediately sold eighteen carts of grain. On the morning of the 11th, they beat drums and gongs, carrying the two banners awarded by the county and a large red banner that said "We Sell Surplus Grain to the State," leading a long grain-selling convoy to Zunhua County. Xu Zhenwu, Deputy County Head of the Zunhua County People's Government, led cadres, students, and citizens from various county organs to meet them at the East Gate, and personally put glorious flowers on the grain-selling models. Representatives of grain-selling models, Guo Lan, Li Rongyu, Zhao Guangde, and others, reported to tens of thousands of people from all over the county who had come to the market about their and the entire village's organized increase in production and enthusiastic support for the general line and patriotic grain sales. This inspired the masses' enthusiasm for selling grain. Hu Jincai, a 61-year-old man from Chanlin Temple Village in the Ninth District, expressed that he would sell more than 1,200 jin of surplus grain. Agricultural producers' cooperatives in Dongba, Zhanggezhuang, Jiaochang in the First District, and Hongyatun in the Tenth District also sent representatives to the County People's Government, wanting to learn from Tianzhuang, sell surplus grain to the state, and support national construction.

Now Tianzhuang Village has transported more than 60,000 jin of grain sold to the state into the granary. (Wang Lin)

    遵化县田庄村农业生产合作社带头卖余粮
    全村集体送粮六万斤入仓鼓舞了全县群众
    河北省遵化县田庄村农业生产合作社和互助组，热烈拥护总路线，自十二月十日开始，全村车马总动员，敲锣打鼓，争先恐后地把余粮卖给国家。
    田庄村共有一百三十二户，在党的领导下，全村在一九五一年冬组织起来，成立了一个农业生产合作社和十一个互助组。两年以来，他们克服了分散经营所不能克服的困难，使土地产量由每亩一百二、三十斤提高三百三十到八百三十斤，家家丰衣足食，改变了过去贫困的状态。最近，在群众中展开学习总路线后，群众觉悟进一步提高，都认识到把余粮卖给国家就是为了自己将来的幸福，是农民的光荣义务。六十一岁的互助组长王宝祥学习了总路线之后说：“要想早几年进入社会主义，就要把余粮卖给国家，让国家多修工厂，好给咱们多造种地的机器。”社员胡玉文开过家庭会议之后，就决定把十石余粮卖给国家。十二月八日他先把搓好的玉米和粳子送到了供销合作社，宣传员立刻广播了这个消息，广大社员们都纷起响应，有的找社务委员去商量；没准备好粮食的刘勇两口子，连夜赶着搓棒子。党支部和农业生产合作社的委员们，为满足社员们的愿望，分头到各户进行了解，又在社务委员会上，根据社员们卖粮的准备情形，决定在十日先集体送粮七大车。农业生产合作社集体卖粮的消息，又影响了互助组。互助组长董万全一面发动本组组员：“我们在爱国增产上没比过合作社，在爱国卖粮上我们可不能再落后。”一面连夜请人帮着搓棒子，第二天太阳还没出来，他们组就已装好了两大车粮食。他们爱国的模范行动，受到了表扬，中共遵化县委和县人民政府派代表到田庄分别授予田庄村和郭岚农业生产合作社两面“爱国增产售粮模范”的锦旗。
    在全村群众大会上，十一个互助组都表示要向合作社看齐，要卖粮支持国家建设，当场就卖出粮食十八车。在十一日上午，他们锣鼓喧天地打着县里奖给的两面锦旗，和“我们把余粮卖给国家”的大红横幛，领着漫长的卖粮车队，赶到遵化县城。遵化县人民政府徐贞武副县长率领县各机关干部、学生、市民迎出东门，并亲自给售粮模范们戴光荣花，售粮模范代表郭岚、李荣玉、赵广德等人，在扩音器前向来自全县各地赶集的数万群众，报告了他们及全村组织起来增加生产和热烈拥护总路线爱国卖粮的情形。鼓舞了群众卖粮的热情。九区禅林寺村六十一岁的老大爷胡进财表示要卖出余粮一千二百多斤，一区东坝、张各庄、教场和十区鸿鸭屯等村的农业生产合作社也都派代表到县人民政府，要向田庄看齐，把余粮卖给国家，支援国家建设。
    现在田庄村已把卖给国家的六万多斤粮食运入粮仓。　　（王　林）
