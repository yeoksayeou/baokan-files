　　Since the railway reached Lanzhou, a city moving towards modernization has emerged in the most central river valley plain of the country.

　　Upon arriving at the train station, people can see the spacious Lanzhou East Railway Station piled high with machinery, steel bars, cement, oil pipes, grain, cloth, and daily necessities, stacked like small mountains. Many temporary warehouses have also been newly built in the square in front of the station.

　　Before Liberation, Lanzhou was an industrially backward consumer city. Industry consisted mostly of handicrafts and semi-handicrafts, with only a few factories possessing some dilapidated machines. In 1949, there were only 3,133 commercial households, and apart from bureaucratic capital, the general business capital was very small. After Liberation, state-owned companies purchased a large amount of local specialties. In three years, a total of 320 billion yuan was invested in the entire province, resulting in great development of industry and commerce in Lanzhou. Compared with 1949, private industry increased by 87%, private commerce increased by 68%, and public industry and commerce increased even more.

　　After the opening of the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway, the changes in Lanzhou's economic landscape became more significant: in the three months of August, September, and October of this year alone, more than 7,000 tons of iron and steel machinery were transported to Lanzhou from the interior via the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway for the development of the Northwest, along with 10,000 tons of building materials such as cement and wood, 3,200 tons of cloth, and a large quantity of daily necessities.

　　Before Liberation, Lanzhou suffered from grain shortages every year during the lean season, and people often starved to death. This year, the rural areas near Lanzhou City suffered from drought. Thanks to the railway, grain from Tianshui, a grain-producing area, was transported in time, preventing a grain shortage in Lanzhou.

　　Large quantities of local specialties from Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang are also shipped out from the East Railway Station: in the three months of August, September, and October of this year, goods shipped from Lanzhou to the interior included 7,100 tons of Qing salt from the Yabulai salt fields of the Alxa League, 2,300 tons of wool from ethnic minority areas, Lanzhou waterpipe tobacco, and 8,500 tons of local products such as medicinal materials from the Qilian Mountains. The nationally renowned Lanzhou waterpipe tobacco could not be sold in the past due to inconvenient transportation, but now it is in short supply. In addition, several thousand tons of mineral oil are transported eastward from the Yumen Oilfield via train every month.

　　After the railway opened, the living standards of the people of Lanzhou City greatly improved. Before Liberation, industrial products in Lanzhou were expensive, and local specialties could not be sold. Ethnic minorities in the vicinity had to use a lot of wool to exchange for a set of clothes. The people of Gaolan County often had stories of two people sharing a set of clothes, a family sharing a quilt, and thirteen- or fourteen-year-old girls having no pants to wear. The local people once described their lives like this: "Pot-boiled potatoes, a dead old man lying on the kang, donkey dung burning under the kang, a sheepskin raft as a warship!" After Liberation, state-owned companies vigorously purchased local specialties on the one hand and transported cloth and grain from the interior for sale at low prices on the other, bringing changes to people's lives. However, due to inconvenient transportation and logistical difficulties, the exchange of local specialties from Lanzhou and industrial products from the interior was still subject to some objective constraints. On September 29, 1952, the train arrived in Lanzhou, and in December, 95,500 bolts of cotton cloth were transported from East China. In the past, cloth from East China had to be transported by train to Xi'an and then transferred to trucks, which doubled the transportation cost. Moreover, railway freight rates are now graded, with fur placed in the 13th grade and medicinal materials in the 20th grade, which reduces the freight cost of transporting large quantities of fur and medicinal materials from Lanzhou to Xi'an by one to two times, thus enabling them to sell well throughout the country and greatly increasing the economic income of the people in the Northwest. Due to the significant reduction in freight costs, large quantities of live pigs are transported from Henan and Shaanxi. In the past, people only heard about Guangdong sugarcane and Jiangxi oranges from outsiders, but now they can also eat them. The people happily sing: "The Communist Party has come, defeating the Jiang bandits, and our Northwest has changed its appearance. Cheap cloth, affordable grain, the sun and moon are exceptionally bright, the people are overjoyed, building railways and opening factories, working day and night for the people, scoring victories on every front, and our country is becoming richer and stronger!"

    兰州在飞跃地前进
    洪流
    火车通到兰州以后，一座走向近代化的城市在全国最中心的河谷平原上出现了。
    一下火车，人们就可以看见宽阔的兰州东火车站上堆满了机器、钢筋、水泥、油管、粮食、布匹、日用百货，堆得就像一座座小山那样高。车站前的广场上，还新建了许多临时货栈。
    兰州在解放前是一个工业落后的消费城市。工业大都是些手工业、半手工业，只有几家工厂有一些破旧的机器。商业户在一九四九年只有三千一百三十三家，除了官僚资本外，一般商号资金都很小。解放后，国营公司大量收购土特产，三年中全省共投放了三千二百余亿元资金，因之兰州工商业有了很大发展，如以一九五二年和一九四九年相比，私营工业增加百分之八十七，私营商业增加百分之六十八，公营工商业增加更多。
    天兰铁路通车以后，兰州经济面貌的变化更显著了：光今年八、九、十三个月，经天兰铁路从内地运兰州开发西北的钢铁机械就有七千多吨，水泥、木材等建筑材料一万吨，布匹三千二百吨，还有大量的日用品。
    解放前，每年青黄不接时，兰州就闹粮荒，常饿死人。今年兰州市附近的农村遭了旱灾，因为有了火车，就及时地把产粮区天水的粮食运来，使兰州避免了粮荒。
    从东火车站又运出了甘肃、宁夏、青海、新疆等地大量的土特产：今年八、九、十三个月，从兰州运往内地的物资有阿拉善旗雅卜来盐地的青盐七千一百吨，少数民族区的羊毛二千三百吨，兰州的水烟，祁连山区的药材等土产八千五百吨。全国驰名的兰州水烟过去因交通不便，推销不出去，现在的水烟却是供不应求，此外，从玉门油矿经由火车东运的矿物油，每月有几千吨。
    通车后，兰州市人民的生活大大地提高了。解放前兰州工业品价格昂贵，土特产卖不出去，附近的少数民族要用很多的羊毛才能换到一身衣裳。皋兰县人民常有两人合穿一身衣裤，一家人合盖一条棉被，十三、四岁大姑娘没裤子穿的事情。当地的老百姓曾这样形容他们的生活：“沙锅煮的洋芋蛋，炕上躺着死老汉，炕下烧的驴粪蛋，羊皮筏子当兵舰！”解放后，国营公司一面大力收购土特产，一面从内地运来布匹、粮食低价出售，使人民生活有了变化。但由于交通不便，运输困难，兰州附近的土特产和内地工业品的交流仍受着一些客观条件的限制。一九五二年九月二十九日火车通到兰州，十二月就从华东区运来棉布九万五千五百匹。过去华东布匹由火车运到西安后即须改用汽车运输，汽车运布匹较火车运价贵一倍。而且现在铁路运费分等级，把皮毛列入第十三等，药材列入第二十等，这就使兰州市大量土特产皮毛和药材运往西安时能降低一倍到两倍的运费，因此得以畅销全国，大大增加了西北人民的经济收入。由于运费大大降低，大批的活猪从河南、陕西运来，过去只听外来人说过的广东甘蔗、江西橘子，现在也能吃到了。人民欢乐地唱着：“来了共产党，打垮了蒋匪帮，咱们西北变呀变了样。便宜的布匹，廉价的粮，日月分外光，人民喜洋洋，修铁路呀开工厂，为人民日夜忙，条条战线上，接连打胜仗，咱们的国家呀越来越富强！”
