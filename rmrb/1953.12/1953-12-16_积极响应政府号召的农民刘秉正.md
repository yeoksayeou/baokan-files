    Farmer Liu Bingzheng Actively Responds to the Government's Call
    Zǐ Gāng
    In Zhangguozhuang Township, Fengtai District, Beijing, when talking about the government's grain purchasing work, Party Branch Secretary Han Wenyu first recommends farmer Liu Bingzheng, who has enthusiastically responded to the government's call twice. He expressed his willingness to act according to the government's plan and sell his surplus grain to the state. When the work team for the grain purchasing campaign sent people to his house, his yard was piled with unhusked corn. He roughly estimated it to be about four hundred catties and said, "I will definitely sell it to the government tomorrow!"

    Liu Bingzheng threshed the corn, put it in bags, and only after weighing it did he realize that there were more than five hundred and thirty catties. He laughed to himself that his eyes weren't working well, how could he have underestimated it so much. His wife and daughter-in-law asked him, "What if there's too much?" He said without any hesitation: "If there's more, then sell more! Anyway, it's enough if there's enough for the family to eat, sell more if there's more!"

    Adding more than one hundred and sixty catties of wheat, Liu Bingzheng carried more than seven hundred catties of grain to the supply and marketing cooperative, exchanged it for six hundred and tens of thousands of yuan, and except for the odd change, opened a savings account of six hundred and thirty thousand yuan at the People's Bank, receiving a monthly interest of one percent. He said to his family: "Don't touch this money."

    After the land reform, Liu Bingzheng's family was given more than eighteen mu of land that originally belonged to the landlord, and three rooms were distributed. He added a small room himself, and life got better and better. This year, after paying public grain, there were more than two thousand catties of grain left over. Rural families like to keep grain at home to live on, selling it whenever they need money. Since the grain purchasing publicity campaign was launched in the three villages of Zhangguozhuang Township, the women whose thoughts hadn't yet shifted from their own stoves began to feel sorry for the grain. Liu Bingzheng's wife and daughter-in-law were influenced and became hesitant. Liu Bingzheng said, "Don't be so narrow-minded! Those women don't understand the policy, they will feel ashamed when they understand it tomorrow."

    Liu Bingzheng guessed correctly. After the comrades of the work team talked to each household, the women all understood. They thought about the increasingly comfortable days of the past few years, and looked at the portrait of Chairman Mao that had been hanging on the wall for several years. Some said: "It's all because my husband didn't explain it clearly, it's for everyone's good. Chairman Mao is in charge of everything for everyone, there's no mistake, we will sell even more!"

    Liu Bingzheng's example of actively selling grain also educated everyone. He is a people's representative of the township, and people trust him in his daily life. Whoever you ask will get this answer: This person has a correct style and is reliable!

    Forty-two-year-old Liu Bingzheng has already become a grandfather. When I found him at his brother's house, he was milling millet while using a winnowing fan to remove the chaff. The man in his early forties already had white hair at the roots, shining brightly in the sun. He was a little embarrassed to receive everyone's praise and said: "It's not because I'm good, it's all because the government's call is right, I just followed it."

    So his brother took care of the winnowing fan and millstone, and we stood in the sun and chatted.

    "You could say that before hearing this grain purchasing and general line for the transition period propaganda, I was already very satisfied with my current life. I suffered so much abuse and beatings from the landlord for so many years, I never dreamed of the days after liberation, having houses and land, raising pigs and chickens, my son becoming an accountant at the Changxindian Railway Machinery Factory, and my little grandson growing up fat and healthy..."

    I remembered visiting his wife and daughter-in-law at his house just now. It was a well-organized family rarely seen in the countryside. The hall frame contained photos from previous years, the tables and chairs were polished, the tea was fragrant, the grandson who had finished breastfeeding was sleeping soundly on the heated kang, and the New Year pictures of chubby children on the wall were torn into strips, surely the achievement of this pampered little guy, bright red new cloaks and new rabbit hats, painting a joyful atmosphere in this family.

    "This time the work team and Director Zhou (Note: Zhou Fengming, Director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry) explained it to us, and I realized that we can't just stop here and be content, we have to go to the other side of the bridge, and transition to socialism. I originally thought it wasn't a matter for my generation, but now it's not 'waiting' for socialism, but 'walking' the road of socialism." Liu Bingzheng said, while taking care of the livestock. This is someone else's livestock, he didn't raise it himself, because there are few people in the family and not enough labor, if he took care of this, he couldn't take care of that. From here we talked about the Zhangguozhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative. He praised its productivity:

    "Working together is good, people who work well can get more than five thousand catties of grain, which is much better than me. I also plan to start a mutual aid team first, and then join the cooperative..." Liu Bingzheng had discussed forming a mutual aid team with his neighbors last year, but it didn't work out. As for joining the cooperative all at once, there are still some ideological obstacles for middle peasants like him with a lot of land and little labor. The Zhangguozhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative relies on eight hundred mu of land, seven hundred mu of which is state-owned land. The cooperative was moved from Xiaying in February of this year because Czechoslovakia was going to send tractors, and the seven hundred mu was originally the land of the state-owned farm.

    Liu Bingzheng has not forgotten the matter of "crossing the bridge," he said:

    "This method is right, the state controls the overall economy and gradually moves towards socialism. It doesn't allow selfishness, personal enrichment, and harming everyone. My son comes back from the factory and often talks to me about socialism. Workers and peasants must unite. We provide grain and raw materials, and they give us farming machines and daily necessities. My son asked me: Dad, are you crossing the bridge or not? I said: The other side of the bridge is better than this side, why not cross it? Selling grain happily is also for crossing the bridge earlier. I've lived through the days under the landlord, and another son died during the famine; I've lived through the days of pushing a wheelbarrow to transport soil and grinding flour under the Japanese and still not having enough to eat, what's selling a little grain? I've calculated it, it's better to sell it early than late, if the grain is not stored well, it will get worms, spread it out on mats in the yard to dry, and the chickens will eat a lot of it, and it also takes manpower."

    Zhangguozhuang Township often has international friends visiting after liberation, from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia... The farmers have entertained them with their own agricultural products and dumplings. Liu Bingzheng also busied himself with entertaining them every time. He said, "They are as close to us as family, and they don't dislike our village being rustic at all, they all say they hope the days of Chinese peasant brothers will get better year by year, and they will build alongside worker brothers." Zhangguozhuang Township is not far from Changxindian, many workers' families live in Zhangguozhuang, and many fellow villagers from Zhangguozhuang go to Changxindian to work, and there is a close connection between them. Liu Bingzheng's son is a member of the Communist Youth League, and factory affairs, international and domestic events, have added a lot of knowledge to this middle-aged farmer. His son also often borrows books and newspapers, and Liu Bingzheng had studied in a private school for several years earlier.

    The film projection team sometimes comes to the township, and recently showed "Return to the Frontline." Liu Bingzheng is even more unforgettable about "The White Haired Girl," he said:

    "Xi'er, Dachun, and Yang Bailao, are all played better than real, opening up the farmers' minds!" Sometimes he also goes to the city to see operas, and has seen the Ping opera "Female Teacher" at the Zhonghe Theater. He likes this kind of opera with a rural background, and said: "In our township, there is more than one teacher, a central elementary school has more than two hundred students, and the Young Pioneers alone have more than fifty, and there are almost forty students studying in middle schools outside!"

    Finally, returning to the grain issue, he rubbed his inflamed eyes and said: "Comrade, to be honest, we can't say that our family is wasteful, but we often eat two-thirds of fine grains a day. From now on, I have made up my mind and convinced the women in our family to eat one-third of fine grains and two-thirds of coarse grains. Those more than one hundred and sixty catties of wheat were sold that way. The eggs laid by the eight chickens will also be sold a little. We will save the money and start a mutual aid team next spring."

    This thin, tall middle-aged farmer seemed to have shaken out all the words from the bottom of his heart, and leaving his cotton-padded jacket, went to take care of the winnowing fan in the early winter sunlight.

    积极响应政府号召的农民刘秉正
    子冈
    在北京丰台区张郭庄乡，谈起政府购粮工作，党支部书记韩文玉首先推荐农民刘秉正，他两次热烈响应政府的号召。他表示愿意按政府的计划行事，把余粮卖给国家。宣传购粮工作的工作组派人到他家时，他院子里正堆着没有脱粒的玉米，他粗粗估计有四百来斤，就说：“赶明儿一定卖给政府！”
    刘秉正把玉米脱粒装袋，一过秤才知道有五百三十多斤，他心里笑自己的眼不好使，怎么估少了那些个。老婆儿媳问他“多了咎办”，他丝毫没加考虑地说：多就多卖呗！反正留下够一家吃的就足了，多了多卖！
    又添上一百六十多斤麦子，刘秉正往供销合作社扛了七百多斤粮食，换回六十几万块钱，除了零头，在人民银行开了一个六十三万的储蓄户头，得到月息一分的优待。他对家里人说：“这钱就别动了。”
    土地改革以后，刘秉正原种地主的十八亩多地归了他家，分了三间房，自己又添盖一小间，日子越过越好。今年除交公粮，剩下两千多斤粮食。农村家庭喜欢守着粮食过日子，随用钱随卖。自从购粮宣传在张郭庄乡的三个村子展开，思想还没从自家锅灶上转开的妇女就心疼起来。刘秉正的老婆儿媳受了影响，犹疑起来，刘秉正就说：“别犯小心眼！那些个妇女是没明白政策，赶明儿明白了，她们也会觉得害臊的。”
    刘秉正猜对了。工作组的同志挨户谈过后，女人们也都明白了。她们想想这几年越来越心宽的日子，看看在墙上挂了好几年的毛主席的像片，有的就说：“都是孩子他爹不说个明白，赶情是为了大家好，毛主席给大家当家主事，错不了，再多些也卖！”
    刘秉正积极卖粮食的例子也教育了大家，他是乡人民代表，平素为人叫大家信得过，问谁也会得到这么个回答：这个人作风正派，不赖！
    四十二岁的刘秉正已经当上爷爷了。当我在他兄弟家找到他的时候，他正在碾谷子，同时把谷子过风箱去糠。四十出头的人已经满头冒白发根了，在太阳下照得闪亮闪亮的。他有些不好意思承受大家对他的奖誉，直说：“这哪儿是我好啊，都是政府号召得对，我跟着走就是了。”
    于是他兄弟替他照料着风箱和碾子，我们站在太阳地里闲扯开了。
    “可以这么说吧，在听这次购粮和过渡时期总路线宣传以前，我对眼下的日子已经很满足了。早先我在地主那儿受苦挨打多少年，作梦也没想到解放以后的日子，有房子有地，喂猪养鸡，儿子当上了长辛店铁路机厂的会计，小孙子长得肥胖肥胖的……”
    我想起刚才在他家拜访他老婆和儿媳的事来了。那是一个在农村中少见的布置得井井有条的家庭，堂屋镜框子里保存着连年的照片，桌椅擦得发亮，沏的茶喷香，吃了饱奶的孙儿在坑头上熟睡，墙上画着胖孩儿们的年画扯得一条条的，准是这受宠的小家伙的成绩，鲜红的新斗篷新兔帽，给这个家庭里涂绘着欢乐的气氛。
      “这次工作组和周局长（按：北京市农林局周凤鸣局长）给我们说开啦，我才知道还不能就此站住、心满意足，还得往桥那边走，过渡到社会主义去。原先以为不是自己这一辈子的事了，不想如今马上不是‘等’社会主义，而是‘走’社会主义的路了。”刘秉正一边说，一边照顾着牲口。这是人家的牲口，他自己没喂，为的是人口少，劳动力不够，顾了这又顾不了那。由这儿我们又谈到张郭庄的农业生产合作社了。他赞美人家的生产力：
      “伙着干就是好，人家劳动好的可以分五千多斤粮食啦，比我强得多。我也打算先搞个互助组，然后入社……”刘秉正去年就曾和街坊商议搞互助组，没弄成。至于一下子入社，对于像他这样地多劳动力少的中农，还有些思想障碍。张郭庄农业生产合作社的靠八百亩地里，有七百亩是国家的土地。合作社是今年二月由于捷克斯洛伐克要送拖拉机，才由下营搬来的，那七百亩原先是国营农场的土地。
    刘秉正还没有忘记“过桥”的事情，他说：
  “这个办法对，由国家掌握总经济，逐步走到社会主义。不许自私自利，个人发财，坑了大家。我儿子从工厂回来，也常和我谈社会主义的事儿，工人农民是得联合，我们拿出粮食和原料，他们给我们耕种机器和日用的东西。儿子问我：爹，你过桥不过桥？我说：桥那边比桥这边好，为什么不过？痛痛快快卖粮食，也为的是早过桥。地主手下的日子过过，另一个儿子在逃荒的年月折腾死了；在日本手下推轱辘车运土、共和面也吃不饱的日子过过，卖点粮食算什么呢？我算计过了，晚卖不如早卖，粮食放不好就长虫，在院子里铺着席子晾晾吧，还得叫鸡子吃掉好些，还占人工。”
    张郭庄乡在解放后常有国际朋友来，苏联的，捷克斯洛伐克的……农民们用自己的农产品和饺子招待过他们。刘秉正也回回忙着招待，他说：“人家和咱亲的就像一家人，一点也不嫌咱村子土里土气，都说希望中国农民弟兄的日子一年年好起来，和工人弟兄肩并肩地建设。”张郭庄乡离长辛店不远，不少工人家属住在张郭庄，不少张郭庄的老乡到长辛店去当工人，他们之间有着亲密的联系。刘秉正的儿子是团员，工厂里的事，国际国内大事，给这个中年农民添了不少知识。儿子也常借书报回来，刘秉正早先从私塾里读过几年书的。
    电影放映队有时到乡里来，最近还放映过“重返前线”，刘秉正更念念不忘“白毛女”，他说：
  “喜儿大春杨白劳，都演得赛过真的，挖开了农民的心窍儿！”有时候他也进城看戏，在中和戏院看过评剧“女教师”，他喜欢这种以农村为背景的戏，并且说：“在我们乡里，教师可不只一位了，一个中心小学学生二百多，光少年先锋队队员就五十多，在外面上着中学的学生快到四十人啦！”
    末后又回到粮食上来，他揉揉在发炎的眼睛说：“同志，不瞒你说，我们家里说不上浪费，可也常是一天吃三分之二细粮，往后，我下了决心，说通了咱们家的妇女，吃三分之一细粮和三分之二粗粮了。那一百六十多斤麦子，就是那么着才卖出来的。八只鸡下的蛋，也要匀出来卖掉一点。留出钱来，明年春天好好儿搞个互助组。”
    这个瘦高个儿的中年农民好像把心底里的话已经抖落干净，丢下棉袄，在初冬的太阳光下照顾风箱去了。
