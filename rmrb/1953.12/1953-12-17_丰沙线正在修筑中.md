    The Fengsha Railway Line is Under Construction
    Chenji
    To the west of Beijing, a railway is being built through towering mountains and valleys. This railway is the Fengtai-Shacheng Line (Fengsha Line). The Fengsha Line is only 105 kilometers long. It starts from Fengtai, passes through the villages and towns of Sanjiadian, Liulichu, Yanchi, Yanhecheng, and Shuiguan, and finally reaches Shacheng on the Jingbao Railway Line. The length of its tunnels accounts for one-quarter of the total length of the line. In the middle section of the Fengsha Line, from Liulichu to Shuiguan, there are only 62 kilometers, but on this 62-kilometer section, there are 28 kilometers of tunnels, and a total of 65 tunnels will be built on the entire line. The distance between some tunnels is only a few tens of meters. People know that there are many tunnels on the Baoji-Tianshui Line (Baotian Line), but the Fengsha Line has even more tunnels than the Baotian Line. In addition, the Fengsha Line will cross the rapid Yongding River eight times.
    The Guangou section of the Jingbao Railway Line from Nankou to Kangjiazhuang is a well-known dangerous area. In this area, the steepest gradient is 33.3 per thousand, and the radius of the sharpest curve is 180 meters. In areas with such steep gradients and sharp curves, each train can only pull 600 tons of cargo, which is more than 1,000 tons less than on a standard line, greatly restricting operations. However, after the Fengsha Line is completed, this situation will be fundamentally changed. After the Fengsha Line is opened to traffic, each train can pull 2,400 tons of cargo, which is three times higher than the transportation capacity of the Guanggou section. The Guanggou section, a historical chokepoint in China, will no longer threaten the people's transportation. In another two years, the coal from Datong, the iron from Xuanhua, the rice from the Wuyuan Hetao, the steeds from Inner Mongolia, the hides, medicinal materials and natural salt from the Ordos, can be continuously transported through the Fengsha Line to the places in the motherland where they are needed.
    When Japanese imperialism invaded North China in the past, it vainly attempted to build the Fengsha Line as quickly as possible. However, it spent a full four years and only completed 20 percent of the Fengsha Line project.
    Last winter, the Fourth Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways began to build this project. By the end of this year, one-third of the entire line will be completed, and the entire line is expected to be opened to traffic in September 1955. The military workers, railway workers, and migrant workers who are building the Fengsha Line understand the importance of their work. They are working hard to ensure that the task is completed on time and to standard. The nationally renowned No. 17 tunnel, which is more than 2,400 meters long, can be basically completed by the end of this year.

    丰沙线正在修筑中
    陈迹
    在北京的西边，一条穿过丛山峻岭的铁路正在修筑中，这条铁路就是丰（台）沙（城）线。丰沙线全长不过一百零五公里，它由丰台起，经过三家店、琉璃渠、雁翅、沿河城、水关等村镇，抵达京绥线上的沙城。它的隧道长度占全线长度的四分之一。在丰沙线的中段，从琉璃渠到水关，只有六十二公里的路程，在这六十二公里的线路上，就有二十八公里长的隧道，全线将要修起六十五座隧道。有些隧道之间的距离，只有几十公尺长。人们都知道宝（鸡）天（水）线的隧道多，但宝天线的隧道还没有丰沙线的多。此外丰沙线还要八次跨越湍急的永定河的流水。
    京绥线从南口到康家庄的关沟段，是著名的天险地区。在这个地区内，最陡的坡度是千分之三十三点三，最急的弯道的半径是一百八十公尺。在这样坡度陡、弯道急的地区，每列列车只能牵引六百吨货物，比一般标准的线路要少拉一千多吨货物，运转上受到很大限制。可是，在丰沙线修好以后，就根本改变这种情况了。丰沙线通车以后，每列列车可以牵引两千四百吨货物，这比关沟段的运输能力要提高三倍。中国历史上的一条咽喉地段——关沟段，将不再威胁人民的运输。再过两年，大同的煤，宣化的铁，五原河套的大米，内蒙古的骏马，西北的皮毛、药材和伊克昭盟的天然盐，可以源源不断地经过丰沙线，迅速的送到祖国需要的地方去。
    日本帝国主义在过去侵占华北的时候，曾妄想要以最快的速度修通丰沙线。但它花费了整整四年的时间，只修筑了丰沙线的百分之二十的工程。
    去年冬天，中央铁道部第四工程局开始修筑这项工程，今年年底将要完成全线三分之一的工程，预计在一九五五年九月修通全线。修筑丰沙线的军工们，铁路职工和民工们，懂得他们工作的重要性，他们紧张地工作着，保证按时地合乎标准地完成任务。两千四百多公尺长的全国著名的十七号隧道，在今年年底可以基本上完工。
