Xinhua News Agency report: According to the Soviet "Pravda", the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party and the Hungarian Council of Ministers issued a resolution on December 23 regarding the development of agricultural production. The purpose of this resolution is to further increase Hungary's agricultural production on a larger scale, to enable the countryside to live a prosperous life, to provide sufficient food supplies for urban and rural residents, and to promote the further consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance.

The resolution pointed out: In order to realize this plan, the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party and the Hungarian Council of Ministers decided to allocate 12 to 13 billion forints (Hungarian currency) in the next three years to develop agriculture.

The resolution said: In order to complete the task of increasing agricultural production, it is necessary to eliminate the imbalance in the development of certain agricultural sectors that still exists, because this phenomenon hinders the overall development of agriculture. It is necessary to stop the behavior of formulating plans without considering local conditions. Therefore, special attention will be paid to the development of agriculture in the areas of Budapest and other industrial cities, stipulating that these areas should first develop horticulture and commercial milk production.

The resolution pointed out: In order to comprehensively improve agricultural production, the Party Central Committee and the government believe that it is necessary to increase the benefits of agricultural producers' cooperative members and individual farmers in improving agricultural production to a greater extent. The resolution also stipulated specific measures in this regard.

The resolution also attaches great importance to the mechanization of agricultural production, the improvement of the work of machine tractor stations, the absorption of agricultural experts to participate in the direct leadership of agricultural production, as well as the training of agricultural cadres and the improvement of scientific research in agriculture.

The final part of the resolution discusses the tasks of the Party in the countryside. The resolution pointed out: In the first half of 1954, approximately 1,000 Party members familiar with agriculture will be sent to agricultural areas to engage in Party work.

    匈劳动人民党中央和部长会议颁布决议
    拨出巨额资金进一步提高农业生产
    【新华社讯】据苏联“真理报”报道：匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会和匈牙利部长会议二十三日颁布了关于发展农业生产的决议。这个决议的目的在于进一步更大规模地提高匈牙利的农业生产，使乡村过富裕的生活，城乡居民得到充足的粮食供应，并促进工农联盟的进一步巩固。
    决议指出：为了实现这个计划，匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会和匈牙利部长会议决定，在今后三年内拨款一百二十到一百三十亿福林（匈币名）来发展农业。
    决议说：为要完成提高农业生产的任务，必须消除直到现在还存在的某些农业部门发展不平衡的现象，因为这种现象有碍农业的整个发展。必须制止不考虑地方情况就制订计划的行为。因此，对于发展布达佩斯和其他工业城市地区的农业就予以特别的注意，规定这些地区首先发展园艺业和商品牛奶业。
    决议指出：为了全面提高农业生产，党中央委员会和政府认为必须在更大的程度上提高农业生产合作社社员和个体农民在提高农业生产中的利益。决议并规定了这方面的具体措施。
    决议对农业生产的机械化、机器拖拉机站工作的改进、吸收农业专家参加农业生产的直接领导工作、以及农业干部的培养和农业中的科学研究工作的改进等，也十分重视。
    决议中的最后一部分是论述党在乡村中的工作任务。决议指出：一九五四年上半年，将派约一千个熟悉农业的党员到农业地区去从事党的工作。
