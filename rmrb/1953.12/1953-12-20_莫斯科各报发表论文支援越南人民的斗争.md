Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 19th: Moscow's major newspapers all published today Chairman Ho Chi Minh's letter to the people of Vietnam on the eve of the seventh anniversary of the nationwide war of resistance in Vietnam, as well as editorials and articles on the Vietnam issue.

    "Labor News" published an editorial entitled "Give Peace to the Vietnamese People," stating: "The people of the world demand a peaceful negotiation to resolve the Indochina issue. The only obstacle on the road to peace between Vietnam and France is the American aggressive bloc, which is deeply interested in maintaining the hotbed of war in Indochina. The war in Indochina is not a French war, but an American war. The American aggressive bloc is putting unprecedented pressure on France, demanding that France continue the meaningless and destructive war on the vast land of Indochina. French patriots and peace defenders of all countries respond to the intimidation and threats of the American aggressive bloc with solid solidarity with the heroic Vietnamese people. The international working class stands at the forefront of this movement. The patriots of Vietnam are deeply grateful for this noble, moral support from the workers of all countries."

    "Izvestia" published an article by S. Kondrashov entitled "Supporting Peaceful Negotiations on the Indochina Issue." He wrote: "The aggressive bloc's policy in Indochina violates the people's will for peace. The task of all peace-loving people, of all those who support easing international tensions, is to strengthen the struggle to stop the war in Indochina and to strive for a peaceful negotiation to resolve the Indochina conflict."

    "Red Star" published an article by Leontiev: "Who is Hindering Peaceful Negotiations in Vietnam?" He wrote: "France does not need to wage war in Vietnam, but the ruling groups in the United States do, in order to maintain and intensify international tensions as a pretext for the arms race; in order to weaken France's position as a great power, turning France into a third-rate country, making France defenseless in the face of a resurgent German militarism; in order to turn Vietnam into an American colony and an aggressive base against China and other Asian countries."

    "Pravda" published an article by Nguyen Cong Hoa, Secretary of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor: "The Vietnamese People's Struggle for Peace and Independence." "Komsomolskaya Pravda" published an article by A. Lyubimov, introducing the struggle and life of the Vietnamese people, with three photos attached.

    莫斯科各报发表论文支援越南人民的斗争
    【新华社莫斯科十九日电】莫斯科各主要报纸十九日都刊载了越南民主共和国政府胡志明主席在越南全国抗战七周年纪念日前夕发表的告全国军民书和有关越南问题的社论与专文。
    “劳动报”以“给越南人民以和平”为题发表社论说：“全世界的人民都要求和平协商解决印度支那问题。横阻在越南与法国的和平道路中间的只有美国侵略集团，它对保持印度支那的战争策源地深感兴趣。印度支那的战争不是法国人的战争，而是美国人的战争。美国侵略集团给法国以空前的压力，要求法国在印度支那辽阔的土地上继续无意义的、毁灭性的战争。法国的爱国者和各国的和平保卫者用同英勇的越南人民的巩固团结来回答美国侵略集团的恫吓与威胁。国际工人阶级站在这个运动的前面。越南的爱国者深深感谢各国劳动者这种高尚的、道义上的支持。”
    “消息报”发表了斯·康德拉绍夫的题为
  “拥护印度支那问题的和平协商”的专文。他写道：“侵略集团在印度支那的政策是违背人民的和平意志的。所有爱好和平人民的任务，所有拥护缓和国际紧张局势者的任务，是加强斗争以争取停止印度支那战争，争取和平协商解决印度支那的冲突。”
    “红星报”发表了列昂节夫的专文：“谁阻碍在越南的和平协商”。他写道：“法国不需要在越南进行战争，但美国的统治集团却需要，为的是保持并加强国际紧张局势，以作为武装竞赛的借口；为的是削弱法国的强国地位，变法国为第三流的国家，使法国在重新恢复的德国军国主义面前毫无保卫能力；为的是变越南为美国的殖民地同反对中国和其他亚洲国家的侵略基地。”
      “真理报”登载了越南总工会书记阮公和的文章：“越南人民为和平和独立的斗争”。“青年团真理报”登载了阿·留比莫夫的文章，介绍越南人民的斗争和生活，并附有三幅照片。
