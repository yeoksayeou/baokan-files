    People's Reception Room of the People's Court

    The query offices, scribal offices, duty rooms, mediation rooms, etc., established by the people's courts at all levels in the past have played a role in facilitating the people and closely linking the people's courts with the masses, and have been welcomed by the broad masses, achieving certain results in their work. Experience has proven that these methods adopted by the people's courts allow many cases to be inquired about as soon as people arrive, reduce the procedures for the court to accept cases, and through people's letters and visits, inspect and improve the work of the courts, and conduct legal education for the masses. Therefore, the Second National Judicial Conference held in April this year decided that people's courts at all levels should establish "People's Reception Rooms," and determined that its tasks are to answer people's questions, handle people's letters, draft complaints, record oral statements, and handle cases that are not very complicated and can be resolved immediately. At present, many local people's courts across the country have, according to the resolution of the Second National Judicial Conference, already established or are in the process of establishing People's Reception Rooms.
    The establishment of this kind of People's Reception Room first enables the people's courts to promptly resolve the masses' questions and simple disputes, simplifies the procedures of judicial proceedings, and thus greatly facilitates the people. The People's Reception Rooms of people's courts in various places are generally located at the entrance of the court, and the masses can go there at any time to inquire or file a lawsuit. The inquiries raised by the masses can generally be answered on the spot; for simple cases in which the masses file a lawsuit, if the plaintiff and the defendant go together, they can often be mediated and resolved on the spot. If mediation fails, the case is accepted and transferred to the trial chamber for handling. Therefore, the masses reflect that "In the past, the court was a big government office, and you had to talk three times to get in (gatekeeper, dispatcher, receiver), but now it is convenient, and the problem is solved as soon as you enter." Some people even compare the "People's Reception Room" to the "outpatient department" of a hospital, saying that it can diagnose and treat diseases (resolve mass disputes) at any time. After the establishment of the People's Reception Room, the number of cases accepted by the people's courts has indeed been greatly reduced. For example, the trial chambers (groups) of twelve county-level people's courts in Jilin Province handled a total of 2,450 criminal and civil cases in July and August this year, while the simple cases handled by the People's Reception Rooms of these twelve units during the same period accounted for 43.1% of the total number of cases concluded by the trial chambers (groups). Because these simple cases can be resolved in a timely manner in the People's Reception Room, the people's court can concentrate its efforts on handling major cases related to production and construction or related to the local central work, which are urgently required by the broad masses to be resolved, so that judicial trial work can better serve the country's economic construction.
    Secondly, the establishment of this kind of People's Reception Room is an effective way for the people's courts to connect with the masses. The people's courts can listen to and collect the masses' opinions on judicial work through the masses' letters and visits, discover shortcomings and problems in judicial trial work, and thus actively improve and improve their work. The Xiaogan County People's Court in Hubei Province once discovered and corrected a case of wrongful judgment on the dissolution of a marriage contract of an unmarried revolutionary soldier's fiancée from a letter from the masses. An employee of the Xi'an Municipal People's Court had a bad attitude towards the parties when hearing a case, and it was also exposed by a letter from Liu Renjie in the Fifth District of the city, which made the employee realize his mistake. This shows that the people's court can also accept the supervision of the masses through the People's Reception Room, so that the people's judicial work can be continuously improved.
    Finally, the People's Reception Room of the People's Court can also combine the handling of simple cases and the answering of difficult questions to carry out legal education to the masses. The reception room of the Shanghai Municipal People's Court handled a total of 493 letters from the people and received 3,066 visitors in the first half of this year. They generally gave serious treatment and answers to the questions they raised, which played a certain role in expanding the publicity of the policies and decrees of the people's government. The reception room of the Huanggu District People's Court in Shenyang City conducted publicity and education to a total of 1,127 people in 20 days through mediating simple disputes and answering inquiries. Some People's Reception Rooms hang pictures related to the publicity of policies and decrees or have judgments with significant educational significance for visitors to read, and use examples to explain the policies and decrees of the people's government, which has received good results.
    Because the People's Reception Room has a wide range of contact with the masses, and the problems encountered are diverse, and they must be handled in a timely and accurate manner, strengthening the leadership of this work, equipping it with cadres of a certain quality and a certain quantity, and improving relevant work systems have become the main links in doing a good job in the People's Reception Room. Many local People's Reception Rooms are working under the direct leadership of the president of the People's Court, who often cares about, inspects and supervises the work of the reception room, personally grasps and handles major issues, regularly participates in the work meetings of the reception room, and equips a group of cadres with a strong mass viewpoint and familiar with various policies, so the work of the reception room has achieved remarkable results, and the inquiries and simple cases raised by the masses can generally be handled in a timely and correct manner. However, some leading cadres of the people's courts do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of the People's Reception Room, and do not actively provide leadership, which makes this work passive, with a large backlog of cases, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. Some places overemphasize the role of the People's Reception Room and confuse it with the trial chamber, and some cases that should be transferred to the court for trial are also handled by the People's Reception Room. This not only fails to quickly close the case, but also hinders the People's Reception Room from handling the people's visits and letters in a timely manner. Therefore, in order to effectively play the role of the People's Reception Room, the people's courts in various places should resolutely correct and prevent the occurrence of the above two phenomena; at the same time, they should also urge the subordinate People's Reception Rooms to establish necessary and feasible work systems, such as registration, transfer, follow-up, review of handling results, regular summary of work, request for instructions and reports, etc., to avoid chaos in the work of the People's Reception Room and ensure the normal progress of work.

    人民法院的人民接待室
    远光
    各级人民法院过去建立的问事处、代书处、值日室、调解室等，都起了便利人民、密切人民法院与群众联系的作用，因而受到广大群众的欢迎，在工作中取得了一定的成绩。经验证明，人民法院采用这些办法，有许多案件可以随到随问，减少法院收案的手续，并可通过人民来信与来访，检查与改进法院的工作，向群众进行法纪的宣传教育。因此，今年四月间召开的第二届全国司法会议，决定各级人民法院均应建立“人民接待室”，并确定它的任务是解答人民的疑难，处理人民的来信，代写诉状，代录口诉，并处理不甚复杂、当时即可解决的案件。目前全国已有许多地方的人民法院，根据第二届全国司法会议的决议，已经或正在建立人民接待室。
    这种人民接待室的建立，首先使人民法院可以及时地解决群众的疑难和简易的纠纷，简化了司法诉讼的程序，从而大大地便利了人民。各地人民法院的人民接待室，一般都是设在法院的门口，群众可以随时前往问事或起诉。群众所提的询问，一般都能当场给予解答；群众起诉的简易案件，原告和被告一同去的，多能当场调解解决，不能调解或调解不成的就作为收案，转审判庭处理。因此群众的反映是：“过去法院衙门大，进门三遍话（门岗、传达、收发），如今方便了，一进门就解决问题”。更有一些群众把“人民接待室”比为医院的“门诊部”，说它能够随时应诊治病（解决群众纠纷）。建立了人民接待室以后，人民法院的收案确实大为减少。如吉林省十二个县级人民法院的审判庭（组），在今年七、八两月份共处理了刑事和民事案件二千四百五十件，而这十二个单位的人民接待室，在同一期中处理的简易案件占审判庭（组）结案总数的百分之四十三点一。由于这些简易案件能在人民接待室得到及时的解决，因而人民法院能够集中力量去处理有关生产建设或与当地中心工作有关的、为广大群众迫切要求解决的重大案件，使司法审判工作更好地为国家的经济建设事业服务。
    其次，这种人民接待室的建立，是人民法院联系群众的一个有效方式。人民法院可以通过群众的来信来访，倾听和收集群众对司法工作的意见，发现司法审判工作中的缺点和问题，从而积极改进和提高自己的工作。湖北省孝感县人民法院就曾从群众来信中，发现并纠正了错判革命军人未婚妻解除婚约的案件。西安市人民法院的一个工作人员在审理案件时对当事人的态度不好，也经该市五区刘人杰来信揭发，使该工作人员认识了自己的错误。这就说明，人民法院通过人民接待室，还可以接受群众的监督，使人民司法工作获得不断的改进。
    最后，人民法院的人民接待室，还可以结合对简易案件的处理和疑难问题的解答，向群众进行法纪的宣传教育。上海市人民法院的接待室，在今年上半年一共处理了人民来信四百九十三件，接见了来访的群众三千零六十六人，对他们提出的问题，一般都作了认真的处理和解答，这在扩大人民政府的政策法令的宣传上是起了一定作用的。沈阳市皇姑屯区人民法院接待室，在二十天中通过调解简易纠纷和解答询问，一共向一千一百二十七人进行了宣传教育。有的人民接待室悬挂有关宣传政策法令的图片或有富有重大教育意义的判决书，供来访群众阅览，用实例来阐述人民政府的政策法令，更收到了良好的效果。
    由于人民接待室接触群众的面比较广，遇到的问题又是多种多样的，而且还要处理得及时和准确，因此加强对这一工作的领导，配备有一定质量并有一定数量的干部，并健全有关的工作制度，就成为做好人民接待室工作的主要环节。许多地方的人民接待室，是在人民法院院长的直接领导下进行工作，院长经常关怀、检查和督促接待室的工作，对重大的问题还亲自掌握处理，定期参加接待室的工作会议，并配备了一批群众观点较强、熟悉各项政策的干部，因而接待室的工作获得显著成绩，群众所提的询问和简易案件，一般都能得到及时正确的处理。但是，也有一些人民法院的领导干部，对人民接待室的重要性认识不足，不积极给以领导，致使这一工作陷于被动状态，案件积压很多，引起了群众的不满。还有一些地方过分强调人民接待室的作用，把它与审判庭混同在一起，有些本应转交法庭审判的案件也要人民接待室来处理。这样不仅不能迅速结案，而且妨碍了人民接待室及时处理人民的来访与来信等工作。因此，为了有效地发挥人民接待室的作用，各地人民法院应切实纠正和防止上述两种现象的发生；同时还应督促所属的人民接待室建立必要的与切实可行的工作制度，如登记、转办、催办、审查处理结果、定期总结工作、请示报告等制度，以避免人民接待室工作发生紊乱，保证工作的正常进行。
