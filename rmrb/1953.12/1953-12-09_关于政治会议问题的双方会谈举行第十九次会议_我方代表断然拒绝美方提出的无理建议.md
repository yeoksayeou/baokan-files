Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 8th December: The delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China participating in the two-sided talks on the question of the political conference issued the following communique:

    The nineteenth meeting of the two sides on the question of the political conference was held on December 8. The US representative, Dean, today put forward a so-called comprehensive proposal of seventeen points, in which he still adhered to his consistent unreasonable position on the central issue of neutral countries participating in the political conference, continued to deny the Soviet Union as a neutral country, restricted the authority of neutral countries in the political conference, opposed the list of neutral countries nominated by our side, and refused to determine the nomination of neutral countries participating in the political conference. Because the US so-called comprehensive proposal has no new content, our side immediately rejected it. Therefore, today's meeting made no progress due to the lack of sincerity of the US side.

    Our representative, Mr. Qi Shifu, made a solemn statement rejecting the other party's unreasonable proposal. Mr. Qi Shifu pointed out that the Soviet Union has consistently maintained strict neutrality in the Korean War. Therefore, the Soviet Union's neutrality is an indisputable fact. However, in today's proposal, the other party still absurdly and unreasonably regards the Soviet Union as one of the belligerent parties, confuses black and white, and distorts facts and truth, which our side absolutely cannot agree to. Moreover, in its proposal, the other party on the one hand opposed the Soviet Union's participation in the political conference as a neutral country, and on the other hand, has never agreed to the other four Asian neutral countries proposed by our side. On the other hand, it imposed unreasonable restrictions on the authority of neutral countries. Therefore, in essence, the other party is still stubbornly refusing the participation of neutral countries in the political conference.

    Mr. Qi Shifu also pointed out that the other party's proposal today is just a rehash of many absurd arguments that have been repeatedly refuted by our side, without any progress or change. Our side pointed out that the real purpose of the other party's proposal today is still to delay and deceive, not to seriously solve the problem. Therefore, our side resolutely rejects this proposal. Finally, Mr. Qi Shifu sternly criticized the other party's attempt to delay the convening of the political conference, entirely for the purpose of forcibly detaining our prisoners of war and undermining the Korean armistice, in order to continue to maintain international tensions; but the other party's sinister policy will never succeed, and the people of the world will see through the other party's sinister conspiracy, and place the serious responsibility for delaying the convening of the political conference and undermining the cause of peace on the other party. Therefore, if the other party still intends to reach an agreement between the two sides, it should quickly change its current unreasonable attitude, abandon its policy of mere delay, seriously consider our reasonable comprehensive proposal, and conduct serious discussions at tomorrow's meeting, so that the talks between the two sides can quickly achieve practical results.

    关于政治会议问题的双方会谈举行第十九次会议
    我方代表断然拒绝美方提出的无理建议
    【新华社开城八日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国参加关于政治会议问题双方会谈的代表团发表公报如下：
    十二月八日，关于政治会议问题的双方会谈举行第十九次会议。美方代表迪安今日提出了一个十七点的所谓全面建议，其中对中立国参加政治会议的中心问题依然坚持其一贯的无理立场，继续否认苏联为中立国，限制中立国在政治会议中的权限，反对我方提名的中立国名单，拒绝确定参加政治会议的中立国提名。由于美方的所谓全面建议毫无新的内容，我方当即断然加以拒绝。因此，今日会议又因美方的缺乏诚意而无进展。
    我方代表奇石福先生作了严正的发言，拒绝对方的无理建议。奇石福先生指出苏联在朝鲜战争中始终如一地严格保持中立，因此苏联的中立性是不容争辩的事实，但对方在今天的建议中却仍然荒谬无理地硬把苏联作为交战双方的一方，混淆黑白，歪曲事实和真理，我方绝对不能同意。而且对方在其建议中一方面反对苏联以中立国身分参加政治会议，并对我方所提出其他四个亚洲中立国家亦始终未予同意，另一方面对中立国的权限加以层层无理的限制，因此在实质上对方仍然在顽固地拒绝中立国参加政治会议。
    奇石福先生并指出，对方今日的建议只是重新罗列了被我方所一再驳斥过的许多荒谬论点，一寸未进，一句未改，毫无新的内容。我方指出，对方今日提出建议的真正目的，仍然是为了拖延与欺骗，并不是认真想解决问题，因此我方断然拒绝这一建议。最后，奇石福先生严词斥责对方企图拖延政治会议的召开，完全是为了强迫扣留我方被俘人员，破坏朝鲜停战，以便继续保持国际紧张局势；但对方这种罪恶政策是决不会成功的，全世界人民都会看穿对方这种罪恶的阴谋，而把拖延政治会议的召开及破坏和平事业的严重责任放在对方身上。因此，如果对方还有意使双方达成协议，就应该迅速改变目前这种无理的态度，放弃一味拖延的政策，郑重考虑我方合理的全面建议，在明天的会议上进行认真的讨论，使双方会谈迅速获得切实的结果。
