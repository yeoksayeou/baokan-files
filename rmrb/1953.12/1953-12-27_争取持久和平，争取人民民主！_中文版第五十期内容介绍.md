The fiftieth issue of the Chinese edition of the Communist and Workers' Parties Information Bureau newspaper "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" has been published.

This issue features an editorial entitled "Communists are Fighters Who Actively Strive for the Cause of the Party." The editorial points out: The characteristic of our era is the increasing number of members of Communist and Workers' Parties, their growing influence, and their increasing ideological and organizational strength. The great task history has given to the Communist and Workers' Parties is to inspire, organize, and lead the working people to fight for liberation from capitalist exploitation and to fight for the establishment of a new society. In order to gloriously accomplish its tasks, the working class party must possess a high degree of combat effectiveness. Therefore, the task of the Communist and Workers' Parties is to train all party members to become active, selfless, persevering, and disciplined fighters in implementing the party's policies and resolutions. After summarizing the situation of Communists in various countries actively fighting for the cause of the Party, the editorial says that recently, the Central Committees of several Communist and Workers' Parties have adopted detailed resolutions and are taking measures to organizationally strengthen the Party, especially strengthening branches and factory party organizations, widely promoting intra-party democracy, adopting collective leadership methods, and carrying out criticism and self-criticism. There is no doubt that these measures will help to enhance the enthusiasm of the masses of party members.

Important articles published in this issue include: "Some Problems in the Party's Ideological Work, Mass Political Work, and Organizational Work" by A. Novotny, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia; "The French People Oppose the Re-armament of West Germany" by Jean Pronteau, member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party; "The Collective Leadership of the Italian Communist Party" by E. Donofrio, member of the Central Steering Committee of the Italian Communist Party; and others.

Novotny's article is a summary of his report at the plenary session of the CPCz Central Committee in early December of this year. Novotny pointed out that the strength of the party has always lied in its unity. The party's ideological consistency, the consistency of the views that Communists have acquired based on Marxism-Leninism, is the foundation of the party's unity. However, the party's ideological work is still lagging behind the great tasks of socialist construction. Therefore, the party's urgent task is to resolutely and relentlessly fight for the purity of Marxist-Leninist propaganda work, and to fight against distorting and vulgarizing Marxism-Leninism. Novotny emphasized that socialist thought expands and strengthens its influence in the struggle against bourgeois ideology. Mass political mobilization work is the most important method of strengthening the party's ties with the working people. In order to complete the great and complex task of building a new socialist society, the party organs must also rely on activists closely united around the party committee, and must carry out daily organizational work among the working people more thoroughly and effectively than ever before.

Donofrio's article points out: The method of collective leadership and the method of placing the individual above the collective are fundamentally opposed. Lenin's method of collective leadership is fully in line with intra-party democracy, which can strengthen the entire party's struggle to win over the broad masses of working people and all citizens, and mobilize them. However, there are still cases of deviating from the principle of collective leadership within the Italian Communist Party, which are incompatible with Lenin's principles of intra-party democracy. We call on comrades to unswervingly abide by Lenin's principles. This call should become the starting point for our party organizations to carry out large-scale daily work to improve the working level of the entire party. (Xinhua News Agency)

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第五十期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五三年第五十期已经出版。
    本期以“共产主义者是为党的事业积极奋斗的战士”为题发表社论。社论指出：我们这一时代的特点是共产党和工人党的党员人数日益增加，它们的影响日益扩大，它们在思想上和组织上日益加强。历史给予共产党和工人党的伟大任务是鼓舞、组织并领导劳动人民为从资本主义剥削下获得解放而斗争，为建立新社会而斗争。为了光荣地完成自己的任务，工人阶级的政党必须具有高度的战斗性。因此，共产党和工人党的任务是：训练全体党员成为执行党的政策和决议的积极的、忘我的、坚忍不拔的和有纪律的战士。社论在综述了各国共产党人为党的事业积极奋斗的情形之后说，最近，若干共产党和工人党的中央委员会通过了详细的决议，并正在采取措施，从组织上来加强党，特别是加强支部和工厂党组织，广泛发扬党内民主，采用集体领导方法，展开批评与自我批评。毫无疑问，这些措施将有助于提高党员群众的积极性。
    本期刊载的重要文章有：捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会第一书记安·诺沃提尼的“党在思想工作、群众政治工作和组织工作上的若干问题”，法国共产党中央委员让·普朗多的“法国人民反对重新武装西德”，意大利共产党中央指导处成员爱·多诺弗里奥的“意大利共产党的集体领导”等。
    诺沃提尼的文章是他今年十二月初在捷共中央全体会议上所作报告的摘要。诺沃提尼指出，党的力量一向就在于它的统一。党在思想上的一致，共产主义者根据马克思列宁主义而获得的观点上的一致，是党的统一的基础。但是目前我们党的思想工作仍然落后于伟大的社会主义建设任务，因此党的迫切任务是坚决无情地为马克思列宁主义宣传工作的纯洁性而斗争，为反对歪曲马克思列宁主义、反对使它庸俗化而斗争。诺沃提尼着重说：社会主义思想是在反对资产阶级思想的斗争中扩大和加强自己的影响的。而群众政治鼓动工作是加强党和劳动人民联系的最重要的方法。为了完成建设社会主义新社会的重大而复杂的任务，党的机关还必须依靠紧密团结在党委员会周围的活动分子，必须比以往更彻底更有成效地在劳动人民中间进行日常的组织工作。
    多诺弗里奥的文章指出：集体领导的方法和把个人放在集体之上的方法是根本对立的。列宁的集体领导方法是完全符合于党内民主制的，它可以加强全党关于争取广大劳动人民和全体公民的斗争，并把他们动员起来。但在意大利共产党内还有脱离集体领导原则的情形，这种情形是与列宁指示我们党内民主的原则不相容的。我们号召同志们坚持不渝地遵守列宁的原则。这个号召应当成为我们的党组织进行大规模的日常工作来提高全党工作水平的开始。（新华社）
