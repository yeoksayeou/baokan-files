Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 2nd: Paris newspapers continue to comment on Chairman Ho Chi Minh's answers to the editor of the Swedish "Expressen" regarding the possibility of resolving the Vietnam War peacefully.

    Pierre Gadaud wrote in "L'Humanité" that Chairman Ho Chi Minh's conversation with the Swedish newspaper "has aroused great hope throughout France. Our people are fed up with this unjust war and are determined to rise up and fight to the end to end it. Ho Chi Minh's proposal will greatly help achieve a ceasefire in Vietnam and begin peace negotiations, which can begin immediately without further delay… But in order for the negotiations to be successful, it is absolutely necessary for both sides to express their desire to hold negotiations.” Gadaud demanded that the French government recognize the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam as the only legitimate government of Vietnam and no longer support the Bao Dai puppet government.

    "Libération" wrote, "Ho Chi Minh's peace proposals have caused panic among the Bao Dai elements." The editorial added, "French public opinion is paying close attention to this statement with great interest. The sincerity of the proposals put forward by the Chairman of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is undoubtedly certain. As for the French government, it is clearly very embarrassed.”

    The newspaper said that during the debate on France's Indochina policy held by the French National Assembly in October, the vast majority of deputies expressed their desire for a peaceful resolution to the Vietnam issue. Everyone admits that there is no way out of the predicament other than peace negotiations. The newspaper said: "The time has come for negotiations, which are desired by all good people in France and Vietnam. It would be a sin to miss this opportunity. No one can prevent the French government from negotiating with Ho Chi Minh, because the ceasefire issue can only be discussed by the belligerents themselves."

    "Combat" published an editorial entitled "We Must Negotiate with Ho Chi Minh." The editorial recounted what Laniel had said in the National Assembly: The French government is willing to consider any suggestions Ho Chi Minh might make. The newspaper said: "Ho Chi Minh's reply has been received, and the whole country expects the government to take appropriate action, because a clear conclusion can be drawn from the reply to the editor of 'Expressen', that is, negotiations with Vietnam can be carried out. All good people cannot deny this fact."

    The newspaper admitted that there are still some people in the French ruling clique who oppose a peaceful resolution of the Vietnam War and continue to gamble on Bao Dai, even though Bao Dai does not have the support of his own people.

    The newspaper continued: The war against Ho Chi Minh's soldiers "has in fact become a crusade partly financed by the United States, which likes to support any crusade that does not require it to supply soldiers."

    "Franc-Tireur" said: "It cannot be said that there is any unease in Paris, but it is indeed very chaotic. Laniel once said that Ho Chi Minh would not answer the humble appeal he recently made to him in the National Assembly. Now it seems that he said this too quickly.”

    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 2nd: The remarks made by Ho Chi Minh, Chairman of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, to the Swedish "Expressen" have strengthened the position of those who advocate peace negotiations.

    French Communist Party member of parliament, Créach Cadec, questioned the government regarding the holding of peace talks with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. He made a brief speech in the French National Assembly on the 1st, presenting the reasons for his inquiry. He emphasized that the French people insist on stopping this bloodshed; the possibility of peace talks is even more obvious today.

    However, the majority of the National Assembly rejected his proposal to discuss the future of a peaceful resolution of the Vietnam War.

    Socialist Party member of parliament, Nigerland, told a reporter from "Le Monde": "The French people want peace. They eagerly hope to end the costly Indochina War so that our country can concentrate all its efforts on completing its main tasks… After Ho Chi Minh made his statement, it is impossible to remain silent.”

    According to "Les Echos", internal divisions have occurred within the French ruling clique regarding the issue of Chairman Ho Chi Minh's remarks.

    Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd: Newspapers in the German Democratic Republic and Poland have published the full text of the remarks made by Ho Chi Minh, Chairman of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, in reply to the Swedish "Expressen."

    Many Polish newspapers have also published related articles and commentaries.

    "Trybuna Ludu" pointed out in an article entitled "The Road to Peace in Vietnam" that Chairman Ho Chi Minh's remarks "made a deep impression on the whole world, especially France." The newspaper said that Chairman Ho Chi Minh's remarks are a major contribution to further easing international tensions. Therefore, all peace-loving people, together with the French people, welcome this statement with satisfaction.

    Newspapers in Warsaw such as "Głos Pracy" and "Życie Warszawy" also unanimously believed that Chairman Ho Chi Minh's remarks opened the way for a peaceful resolution to the Vietnam issue.

    法国报纸继续评论胡志明主席的谈话
    许多报纸主张通过和平谈判停止越南战争
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社巴黎二日讯：巴黎报纸继续评论胡志明主席就以和平方式解决越南战争的可能性答瑞典“快报”主编问。
    皮埃尔·古达德在“人道报”上写道，胡志明主席对瑞典报纸的谈话“在全法国引起了巨大的希望。我们的人民对这场非正义的战争已厌烦透了，他们决定起来为结束这场战争而斗争到底。胡志明的建议将大大有助于在越南达成停战并开始和平谈判，这些谈判可以立即开始，不要再拖延了……但是为了使谈判得到成功，双方绝对有必要表示举行谈判的愿望。”古达德要求法国政府承认越南民主共和国政府为越南唯一合法的政府，并不再支持保大傀儡政府。
    “解放报”写道，“胡志明的和平建议在保大分子中间引起了恐慌。”社论又说，“法国舆论以极大的兴趣注意这个声明。越南民主共和国主席所提出的建议的诚恳性是肯定无疑的。至于法国政府，它显然是很狼狈的了。”
    该报说，法国国民议会在十月间就法国对印度支那政策的问题举行的辩论中，绝大多数的议员表示了他们的和平解决越南问题的愿望。每个人都承认除了和平谈判外，没有别的办法可以摆脱困境。该报说：“为法越两国一切善良人民所渴望的谈判已成为可能的这个时候来到了。如果错过这个时机就是一种罪恶。没有人可以阻止法国政府与胡志明进行谈判，因为停战问题只能由交战双方自己来讨论。”
      “战斗报”以“我们必须与胡志明谈判”为题发表社论，社论追述了拉尼埃曾在国民议会中所说的话：法国政府愿意考虑胡志明可能提出的任何建议。该报说：“胡志明的答复已经收到，全国都期望政府采取适当的行动，因为从对‘快报’主编的答复中可以得出一个明确的结论，即和越南的谈判是可以进行的。一切善良的人们都不能否认这个事实。”
    该报承认，在法国统治集团中仍然有一些人在反对越南战争的和平解决，并继续在保大身上押赌注，尽管保大得不到本国人民的支持。
    该报继续说：对胡志明的士兵进行的战争“实际上已成为一支由美国出一部分经费支持的十字军，美国是喜欢支持任何无需它供给士兵的十字军的。”
    “义勇军报”说：“不能说巴黎有什么不安，但那里的确很混乱。拉尼埃曾说，胡志明不会答复他最近在国民议会的发言中向他所提出的谦恭的呼吁，现在看来他这句话似乎说得太快了。”
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社巴黎二日讯：越南民主共和国主席胡志明对瑞典“快报”的谈话，坚定了那些主张和平谈判的人的立场。
    法国共产党议员克列埃日·瓦尔里蒙就与越南民主共和国政府举行和谈一事向政府提出质询。他一日在法国国民议会上作了简短的发言，就自己的质询提出理由。他着重指出，法国人民坚持要求停止这一流血；和谈的可能性今天更加明显了。
    但是，国民议会的多数否决了他提出的关于就和平解决越南战争的前途进行讨论的这一要求。
    社会党议员尼日兰向“新闻报”记者说：“法国人民希望和平。他们热望停止耗费巨大的印度支那战争，以便使我们的国家能集中全部力量来完成主要的任务……胡志明发表谈话后，要想保持缄默是不可能的。”
    据“回声报”证实，在对待胡志明主席谈话的问题上，法国统治集团内部发生了意见分歧。
      【新华社三日讯】德意志民主共和国和波兰报纸纷纷刊登越南民主共和国胡志明主席答复瑞典“快报”的谈话全文。
    波兰许多报纸并发表了有关的文章和评论。
  “人民论坛报”在题为“走向越南和平的道路”的文章中指出，胡志明主席的谈话“使全世界尤其是法国获得了深刻的印象”。该报说，胡志明主席的谈话是对进一步缓和国际紧张局势的重大贡献。因此所有爱好和平的人民和法国人民一起，满意地欢迎这个声明。
    华沙的“劳动之声报”、“华沙生活报”等报也一致认为胡志明主席的谈话为和平解决越南问题开辟了道路。
