Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 25th:

Our entire working people welcome with great satisfaction the verdict of the Special Tribunal of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union on the case of the traitor and spy Beria and the members of the treasonous group he assembled: Merkulov, Dekanozov, Kobulov, Goglidze, Meshik, and Vlodzimirsky. The court's decision to sentence these conspirators to the supreme penalty—execution by firing squad—and the execution of this sentence are in accordance with the unanimous demands of the Soviet people. Comrade Yaremenko, a worker at the "Lenin Metallurgy" machine factory in Kyiv, said that the Soviet court expressed the people's wishes with its verdict.

When discussing the communique of the Soviet Supreme Prosecutor's Office, all Soviet working people unanimously demanded the ruthless elimination of this gang of traitors, to eradicate from Soviet soil these vile conspirators who plotted to undermine the worker-peasant alliance, to destroy the friendship of the Soviet nationalities, to seize power, to disintegrate the worker-peasant Soviet system, and to restore bourgeois rule.

The people's wish has been fulfilled. Comrade Guanna, chairman of the "Red Collectivist" collective farm in the Nekrasov district of the Yaroslavl region and a Hero of Socialist Labor, said that all collective farmers unanimously support this just verdict. No bad elements, no matter how carefully they disguise themselves, can ever undermine the power and strength of our country, nor can they undermine the foundation of our happiness—the collective farm system. All the enemy's conspiracies will be bankrupted, and the enemy themselves will be eliminated. Collective farmers must unite even more closely around the beloved Communist Party and redouble their efforts to strive for a rapid upsurge in agriculture. This is the voice of all the working people of our country—all workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals. This voice demonstrates their unanimous approval of rounding up, exposing, and eliminating this gang of conspirators and traitors to the motherland.

The case of Beria and his accomplices once again reminds the Soviet people that the reactionary forces of foreign imperialism are consistently carrying out subversive activities against our motherland. They are constantly advocating the so-called "Cold War," endlessly slandering the Soviet Union in newspapers and on radio broadcasts, trying every means to send spies and subversives into our country, and allocating hundreds of millions of dollars to engage in subversive activities. Through their intelligence agencies, the reactionary groups of imperialism frantically seek out all kinds of corrupt elements and traitors in the Soviet Union, using them to achieve their destructive aims. They cannot rely on anyone else in the Soviet Union, because we have long since eliminated the exploiting classes, and the entire Soviet society is united by a great spiritual and political unity. Therefore, traitors like Beria and his accomplices have become a godsend to the reactionary bourgeoisie.

The investigation and trial confirmed that foreign reactionaries had ample reason to regard Beria as "one of their own," as a reliable agent and spy. As early as 1919, Beria served as an agent in the intelligence agency of the Musavat government in Baku, which carried out the most despicable and insidious instructions of the British intelligence agency. In 1920, Beria committed treason again in Georgia, establishing secret contact with the secret police of the Menshevik government, which was also a branch of the British intelligence agency. In later years, until his arrest, Beria continued to strengthen and expand his contacts with foreign intelligence agencies. In order to carefully disguise his hostile activities, he colluded with a group of conspirators to form a treasonous group, which included those who had been in league with him for many years, jointly committing extremely serious acts of treason.

The conspirators' despicable and criminal goal was to attempt to place the institutions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs above the Communist Party and the Soviet government, to use these institutions against the Party and the government, against the people, in order to seize power, to disintegrate the worker-peasant Soviet system, to restore capitalism and to restore bourgeois rule in our country.

In order to cover up their criminal activities and fearing exposure, the conspirators carried out terrorist persecution against certain people. They falsely accused those loyal workers of Party and Soviet organs who hindered their seizure of power, and vilely plotted against these people. In order to murder cadres who were loyal to the cause of the Communist Party and the Soviet regime, they committed extremely serious crimes.

After the death of J.V. Stalin, all international reactionary forces became rampant, hoping to weaken the Soviet state. Their agent and servant, Beria, relying on the general intensification of reactionary imperialist forces, also began to intensify his activities. In order to plot to seize power, he began to do his utmost to place members of his conspiratorial group in leading positions in the central and local organs of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, while adopting ruthless measures against honest workers in the Ministry of Internal Affairs who refused to carry out the criminal instructions of these conspirators, suppressing, excluding, and persecuting them.

In Beria's insidious, treasonous plan, he conspired to obstruct the implementation of the Party and government's measures for developing agriculture in order to undermine the worker-peasant alliance, weaken the collective farm system, and create difficulties in the country's food supply.

In order to achieve his divisive goals, Beria took many criminal measures to allow the remnants of bourgeois-nationalist elements in the various Union republics to run rampant, and to create hostility and hatred among the various nationalities of the Soviet Union, primarily to undermine the friendship between the various nationalities of the Soviet Union and the great Russian people.

When Beria was carrying out all these divisive tricks, he was counting on his foreign masters—the reactionary groups of imperialism—to "value" the efforts of this old agent and to support his anti-Soviet conspiracy. The foreign masters were indeed doing everything possible to incite their servants, demanding that he carry out anti-Soviet plans.

However, the enemy's hope of weakening the Soviet state was dashed. In the face of rampant imperialist forces, our people are more closely united around the Communist Party and the Soviet government, devoting their energy and labor to implementing the policies formulated by the Party.

Beria was conclusively exposed because of the destructive activities of his conspiratorial group. The Central Committee of the Communist Party and the Soviet government exposed this traitor and running dog, identified and eliminated the conspiratorial group he had assembled. Thanks to the high vigilance of our Party and government, which vigilantly defended the interests of the people, the counter-revolutionary conspiracy of this cleverly disguised running dog, traitor, and spy has been shattered.

The case of Beria and his accomplices is over. This conspiratorial group was more despicable and filthy than any conspiratorial group in history that opposed the Soviet people, and the members of this group were all sentenced to the supreme penalty—execution by firing squad. This sentence has been carried out. The people unanimously condemn Beria and his accomplices, who deserved to die.

The Beria case once again reminds us that we must strive to raise our political vigilance at all times and in all places. In order to raise vigilance, the Party and government have taken various measures to ensure that Party organizations regularly and systematically supervise the work of state organs at all levels, including the organs of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and to take measures to strictly supervise the implementation of Soviet legislation. The Party is implementing these measures in accordance with the instructions of V.I. Lenin, who repeatedly pointed out the significance of Soviet legislation. He said: "Any slightest illegal act, any slightest violation of the Soviet order, has already created loopholes, and the enemies of the working people will immediately use these loopholes."

The Party organization's unremitting, systematic, and unconditional supervision of the work of state organs at all levels, and the supervision of the accurate and consistent observance of socialist legislation, will undoubtedly promote the Soviet people's political vigilance and make it more effective. This also means the further consolidation of the Soviet state, meaning the further strengthening of its power. All the Soviet people also estimate the significance of the exposure of the Beria conspiratorial group in this way, and all objective and honest people in the capitalist countries also estimate it in this way. The Indian "National Herald" recently said very correctly: The news of the exposure of Beria and his accomplices "proves that the Soviet regime is consolidated and that it believes in its own strength."

The Soviet people have crushed and cleared away the insidious bad elements from their path, and are advancing with confidence along the glorious road of communist construction. The Communist Party and the Soviet government are mobilizing all the labor and creative forces of workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals to fully develop the peaceful economy, vigorously improve socialist agriculture and the production of daily necessities, and continuously improve the welfare of all working people in urban and rural areas. These lofty construction tasks are in line with the vital interests of our people and in line with the interests of defending and consolidating world peace. Under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party headed by the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, the Soviet people will spare no effort and labor to successfully complete these tasks.

    法院的判决就是人民的判决
    ——苏联“真理报”十二月二十五日社论
    我国全体劳动人民以非常满意的心情，来欢迎苏联最高法院特别法庭对于叛徒和间谍贝利亚以及他所拼凑起来的叛国集团的成员麦尔库洛夫、德卡诺佐夫、柯布洛夫、戈格利泽、麦希克和弗洛齐米尔斯基的案件的判决。法院判处这批阴谋分子以极刑——枪决的决定，以及执行这一判决，是符合苏联人民的一致要求的。基辅的“列宁冶炼”机器工厂的工人雅雷曼科同志说，苏联法院以它的判决表达了人民的愿望。
    全体苏联劳动人民在讨论苏联最高检察署的通告时，一致要求毫不留情地消灭这帮叛徒，把这些阴谋破坏工农联盟、破坏苏联各民族友谊、夺取权力、瓦解工农苏维埃制度和恢复资产阶级统治的卑鄙的阴谋分子，从苏维埃国土上铲除掉。
    人民的愿望实现了，雅罗斯拉夫州涅克拉索夫区“红色集体主义者”集体农庄主席、社会主义劳动英雄古安娜同志说，全体集体农民一致拥护这一公正的判决。任何坏分子，无论他们怎样周密地把自己伪装起来，都永远不能破坏我们国家的威力和实力，永远不能破坏我们幸福的基础——集体农庄制度。敌人的一切阴谋必将破产，敌人自己也必将被消灭。集体农民要更加紧密地团结在亲爱的共产党的周围，要加倍努力争取农业的急剧高涨。这就是我国全体劳动人民——全体工人、集体农民、知识分子的呼声。这一呼声说明他们一致赞成一网打尽、揭发和消灭这一帮阴谋分子和祖国的叛徒。
    贝利亚及其同谋分子的案件又一次提醒苏联人民：外国帝国主义反动势力是坚持不变地在对我们祖国进行颠覆活动。他们不断鼓吹所谓“冷战”，在报纸上和无线电广播中对苏联进行无休止的污蔑，想尽办法派间谍和颠覆分子到我国来，拨出数以亿计的美元从事颠覆活动。帝国主义反动集团通过本国的情报机关狂热地在苏联寻找形形色色的腐化分子和叛徒，利用他们来实现自己的破坏目的。他们在苏联无法依借任何别的人，因为我国早就消灭了剥削阶级，整个苏维埃社会是由伟大的精神上和政治上的一致而团结在一起的。因此，像贝利亚和他的同谋分子这样一些叛徒就成了资产阶级反动派的天赐之宝。
    侦讯和审判确定，外国反动派有充分的理由把贝利亚当作“自己人”，当作可靠的代理人和间谍。早在一九一九年，贝利亚就在巴库的穆沙瓦特政府的情报机关中充当特务，这个情报机关执行着英国情报机关的最卑鄙、最阴险的指示。一九二○年，贝利亚在格鲁吉亚又一次犯了叛国罪行，他跟孟什维克政府的秘密警察建立了秘密联系，而孟什维克政府的秘密警察也是英国情报机关的一个分支。在以后的年代中，直到他被捕时为止，贝利亚继续加强并扩大他和外国情报机关的联系。为了周密地伪装自己的敌意活动，他勾结了一群阴谋分子组成叛国集团，加入这个集团的有和他多年来狼狈为奸共同犯了极其严重的叛国罪行的人。
    阴谋分子的卑鄙的罪恶的目的，就是企图把内务部的机构放在共产党和苏联政府之上，利用这些机构来反对党和政府，反对人民，以便夺取权力，瓦解工农苏维埃制度，使资本主义复辟并恢复资产阶级在我国的统治。
    阴谋分子为了掩饰自己的罪恶活动，害怕别人揭发他们，曾对某些人进行了恐怖迫害。他们诬告那些妨害他们夺取权力的党和苏维埃机关的忠诚的工作人员，卑鄙地暗算这些人。为了杀害忠实于共产党和苏维埃政权的事业的干部，他们犯了极其严重的罪行。
    约·维·斯大林逝世后，一切国际反动势力猖獗起来，指望削弱苏维埃国家。它们的代理人和佣仆贝利亚指靠反动帝国主义势力的普遍加紧，也开始加紧他的活动。为了策划攫取权力，他开始竭力把他的阴谋集团的成员安插在内务部的中央机构和地方机构的领导职位上，而对拒绝执行这些阴谋分子的罪恶指示的内务部的正直工作人员采取无情的手段，对他们进行压制、排挤和迫害。
    在贝利亚的阴险的叛国的计划中，他阴谋阻挠党和政府的关于发展农业的措施的执行以破坏工农联盟，削弱集体农庄制度，造成国内粮食供应的困难。
    贝利亚为了达到挑拨离间的目的，采取了许多罪恶的措施，使各加盟共和国的资产阶级—民族主义分子的残余猖獗起来，并在苏联各族人民之间制造敌意和仇恨，首先是破坏苏联各族人民和伟大的俄罗斯人民的友谊。
    贝利亚进行所有这些挑拨离间的诡计时，指望外国主子——帝国主义反动集团“看重”自己这个老代理人的努力并支持他的反苏维埃的阴谋。外国主子的确也在千方百计地鼓动他的佣仆，要求他执行反苏维埃的计划。
    但是，敌人削弱苏维埃国家的希望落空了。在猖獗的帝国主义势力面前，我们的人民更加紧密地团结在共产党和苏联政府的周围，不惜以精力和劳动，实现着党所制订的政策。
    贝利亚由于他的阴谋分子的破坏活动而证据确凿地暴露了自己的面目。共产党中央委员会和苏联政府揭发了这个叛徒和走狗，查明并铲除了他所拼凑成的阴谋集团。由于警觉地捍卫着人民利益的我们的党和政府的高度警惕性，这一巧妙地伪装起来的走狗、叛徒和间谍的反革命阴谋已被粉碎了。
    贝利亚和他的同谋者的案件结束了。这个阴谋集团比历史上任何反对苏联人民的阴谋集团都更加卑鄙龌龊，这个集团的成员都被判处极刑——枪决。这一判决已经执行了。人民同声痛骂死有余辜的贝利亚和他的同谋分子。
    贝利亚案件又一次提醒我们必须努力随时随地提高政治警惕。为了提高警惕，党和政府曾采取了各种措施使党组织经常地有系统地监督包括内务部各机构在内的各级国家机构的工作，并采取措施严格监督苏联立法的执行。党是遵循着乌·伊·列宁的指示执行这些措施的。乌·伊·列宁曾三番五次地指出苏联立法的意义。他说：“任何一点点非法行为，对苏维埃秩序的任何一点点破坏，就已经造成了漏洞，劳动人民的敌人会马上利用这些漏洞。”
    党组织毫不松懈地、有系统地、毫无例外地监督各级国家机构的工作，监督社会主义立法得到准确的和一贯的遵守，这无疑会促使苏联人民提高政治警惕，使之更加有效。这也就意味着苏维埃国家的进一步的巩固，意味着它的力量的进一步的强大。全体苏联人民也正是这样来估计贝利亚阴谋集团被揭发这一事实的意义，各资本主义国家的一切客观的、正直的人们也是这样来估计的。印度“国民先驱报”最近说得十分对：贝利亚和他的同谋分子被揭发的消息“证明苏维埃政权是巩固的，证明它相信自己的力量”。
    苏联人民粉碎了并从自己的道路上清除了阴险的坏分子，满怀信心地沿着共产主义建设的光荣的道路前进。共产党和苏联政府动员工人、集体农民和知识分子的全部劳动和创造力量全力发展和平经济，大力提高社会主义农业和日用品生产，不断增进城乡全体劳动人民的福利。这些崇高的建设任务是符合我国人民的切身利益，符合保卫和巩固世界和平的利益的。苏联人民在以苏联共产党中央委员会为首的苏联共产党的领导下，将不惜一切精力和劳动来胜利地完成这些任务。
