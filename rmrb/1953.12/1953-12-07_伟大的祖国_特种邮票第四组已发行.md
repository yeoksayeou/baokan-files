    The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of the Central People's Government issued the fourth set of "Great Motherland" special stamps on December 1st of this year. The designs of this set of stamps depict ancient Chinese inventions, and there are four types in total: One in gray depicts the world's oldest compass – the Sinan, which is a spoon-shaped magnetic needle carved from natural lodestone, placed on a smooth, mirror-like copper plate with engraved directions around it, with the handle of the spoon pointing south. One in green is the world's earliest instrument for recording earthquakes invented by Zhang Heng of the Eastern Han Dynasty – the seismograph. This instrument was cast with eight copper dragons facing downwards, each marking one of the eight directions, and each dragon held a copper ball in its mouth, with a copper toad placed below each dragon. When an earthquake occurred, the copper ball held in the mouth of the dragon facing that direction would be released and fall into the mouth of the copper toad below. One in indigo green is the world's earliest odometer – the recording drum cart, created in China during the Han Dynasty (around the 3rd century). For every "li" (Chinese mile) this cart traveled, the two small wooden figures at the front and rear of the cart would simultaneously beat a drum once. One in brown is the armillary sphere, an astronomical instrument created by Guo Shoujing of the Yuan Dynasty. This instrument used four bronze dragons to hold up various bronze rings engraved with precise numbers, marking the horizon circle, the equator, the ecliptic, and the meridian circle, and could be used to measure the horizontal longitude and latitude of various planets. The left side of the above designs are all printed with border patterns from the same era as the instrument. The face value of all the stamps is eight hundred yuan. In addition, the fifth set (New China Women set) of art postcards has also been issued in post offices across the country. (Xinhua News Agency)

    “伟大的祖国”特种邮票第四组已发行
    中央人民政府邮电部在今年十二月一日发行“伟大的祖国”特种邮票的第四组邮票。这组邮票的图案画的都是我国古代的发明，共有四种：灰色的一种是世界上最古老的指南针——司南，这是用天然磁石雕琢成匙勺样的磁针，放在光滑如镜的周围刻着方位的铜盘上，勺柄指向南方。绿色的一种是我国东汉时张衡发明的世界上最早的记录地震用的仪器——地动仪。这种仪器上铸着八条头朝下的铜龙，分志着八个方向，龙口里都衔有铜球，每条龙的下面放着一个铜蛙。哪里发生地震，那个方向的龙口里所衔的铜球就吐落在下面的铜蛙口里。靛绿色的一种是我国汉代（约三世纪时）创制的世界上最早的里程计——记里鼓车。这种车子每行驶一里，车上的前后两个小木人就同时击鼓一次。棕色的一种是我国元代郭守敬创造的天文仪器——浑仪。这种仪器用四条铜龙举着刻有精密度数的各个铜环，标志着地平圈、赤道、黄道和子午圈，可以用来测定各个星球的地平经纬度。上述图案的左边都印着和那种仪器同一时代的边饰花纹。邮票的面值都是八百元。此外，第五组（新中国妇女组）美术明信片也已在各地邮局发行。  （新华社）
