    Jiangsu Province's cooperative system exceeded its original cotton purchase plan for November by about 10%, more than doubling the actual purchase volume in October. The amount of cotton handed over to the state-owned textile companies by cooperatives at all levels in November increased by more than 75% compared to October.
    Cooperatives at all levels in Jiangsu Province started purchasing cotton in large quantities in November. Many cooperatives have replenished their purchasing staff and added purchasing points and tools. Nearly seventy power-driven cotton ginning factories throughout the province have launched labor competitions, striving to increase output while improving quality. In the competition, cotton ginning factories in Nantong, Baoshan and other counties reduced lint wastage and increased output and quality. Dongtai, Xinghua and other counties organized nearly 2,000 cotton ginning machines to gin cotton to supplement the insufficiency of power-driven cotton ginning machines. Supply and marketing cooperatives in all cotton-producing areas of the province took the initiative to contact local transportation departments, and through the transportation departments, organized local transportation tools that could be used to transport the purchased and processed cotton to the cities in a timely manner.
    During the purchase, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places expanded the supply of goods to meet the needs of cotton farmers. The turnover of supply and marketing cooperatives in Nantong, Rugao and other places in November increased by more than double compared to October.

    江苏合作社系统超额完成上月份购棉计划
    江苏省合作社系统十一月份收购棉花超过原订收购计划百分之十左右，比十月份收购实绩增加一倍以上。十一月份各级合作社交给国营花纱布公司的棉花比十月份增加百分之七十五以上。
    江苏省各级合作社十一月份开始大量购棉。很多合作社都充实了收购人员，增添了收购点和收购工具。全省近七十个动力轧花厂开展了劳动竞赛，在提高质量的基础上努力提高产量。南通、宝山等县轧花厂在竞赛中减少衣耗，提高产量和质量。东台、兴化等县组织近两千台轧花机轧花，以辅助动力轧花机之不足。全省各棉产区供销合作社主动和当地交通运输部门取得联系，通过交通运输部门组织当地可能运用的运输工具，把收购加工的棉花及时送到城市去。
    在收购中，各地供销合作社扩大了商品供应，以满足棉农需要。南通、如皋等地供销合作社十一月份营业额比十月增加了一倍多。
