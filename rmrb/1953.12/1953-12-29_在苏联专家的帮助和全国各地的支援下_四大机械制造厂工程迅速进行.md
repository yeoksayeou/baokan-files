    With the Help of Soviet Experts and Support from All Over the Country, the Construction of Four Major Machinery Manufacturing Plants is Proceeding Rapidly
    [Our Newspaper] The construction projects of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant, Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Plant, and Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, which are under active construction, are key projects among the 141 large-scale enterprises that the Soviet Union is helping China to build. These four major projects have achieved great success since construction began this year. Currently, the construction of these four factories is proceeding intensely in winter, and preparations are actively underway for construction next year.
    By the end of November, the building construction of these four factories had been basically completed, and the machine installation work had completed more than 70% of the annual project. This year, most of the factory building projects have been completed or exceeded the annual plan. For example, the construction of five factory buildings of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant exceeded this year's engineering volume by 250% before freezing, and the quality met the standards. The Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant also added the construction task of the measuring tool factory building, and the Pneumatic Tool Plant also added the cutting and forging workshop and other projects.
    These four major projects have received specific guidance and assistance from Soviet experts. Taking the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Plant as an example, Soviet experts Ivaki and Dadalin Ze have put forward 1,397 various suggestions and questions and answers from May 13 to October 20. The implementation results of 1,357 of these saved funds of about 8 billion yuan; the foam concrete processing plant reached the best quality standards; after the steam curing method was adopted for reinforced concrete prefabricated parts, the curing period was shortened from 14 to 28 days to 15 hours to 1 day, which accelerated the construction progress and enabled the tool and repair workshop to be completed and put into production two months earlier, the cutting tool factory building can be completed half a year earlier, and the measuring tool factory building can also be completed two months earlier.
    In the process of building these four factories, they have also continuously received strong support and assistance from all over the country. For example, various places have transported a large number of personnel and materials to support the construction of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. In just a few months, the Northeast Region has successively transported more than 1,000 cadres, and the construction teams of about 10,000 people from construction engineering companies in East China, Central South China, and Harbin have also joined the work one after another. Now, the construction of the First Automobile Factory includes workers of all ethnic groups from 28 provinces and cities. 46 factories across the country are training various technical workers for it, and more than 70 other factories are manufacturing various materials and equipment for it.
    Next year, the construction task of these four factories will be more than four times larger than this year. In order to ensure the realization of next year's plan, the factories have actively carried out various preparations before construction next year. The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant began preparations from design, construction, materials, equipment and other aspects in September, and the basic construction plan for 1954 has now been compiled. The other three factories are also working intensely on winter construction and indoor machine installation projects, and are manufacturing various prefabricated parts in construction-related enterprises, and are actively preparing to meet new tasks next year.

### 在苏联专家的帮助和全国各地的支援下  四大机械制造厂工程迅速进行

    在苏联专家的帮助和全国各地的支援下
    四大机械制造厂工程迅速进行
    【本报讯】正在积极建设中的第一汽车制造厂、哈尔滨量具刃具厂、沈阳风动工具厂和沈阳第一机床厂等四大机械制造厂工程，都是苏联帮助我国建设的一百四十一项规模巨大的企业中的重点工程。这四大工程在今年施工以来，获得了很大的成绩。现在这四个工厂的工程正紧张地进行冬季施工，并积极进行明年施工准备工作。
    到十一月底为止，这四个工厂的建筑工程均已基本完成，机器安装工程也完成了全年工程的百分之七十以上。今年各厂厂房工程绝大部分已经完工或超过了年度计划。如第一汽车制造厂五个厂房的建设，在结冻前就超额完成了今年工程量百分之二百五十，而且质量合乎标准。哈尔滨量具刃具厂又增加了量具厂房施工任务，风动工具厂也增加了切料锻压车间等工程。
    这四大工程，都得到了苏联专家的具体指导和帮助。以哈尔滨量具刃具厂为例，苏联专家伊瓦基和达达林则夫，从五月十三日到十月二十日止，提出的各种建议和问题解答就有一千三百九十七条。其中一千三百五十七条执行结果，节约了资金约八十多亿元；泡沫混凝土加工厂达到了最好的质量标准；钢筋混凝土预制件采取了蒸气养生法后，养生期由十四天到二十八天缩短到十五小时至一天，加速了施工进度，使工具及修理车间可提前两个月、刃具厂房可提前半年，量具厂房也可提前两个月竣工投入生产。
    在这四个厂的建厂过程中，还不断地得到了全国各地的大力支援和帮助。如各地为支援第一汽车制造厂的建设，输送来了大批的人员和物资。东北区在短短的几个月内，就连续输送来一千多个干部，由华东、中南、哈尔滨等地的建筑工程公司来的约一万人的建筑队伍，也已相继地参加工作。现在参加第一汽车厂建设的，包括有二十八个省、市的各族的工作人员。全国并有四十六个工厂正在为它训练着各种技术工人，另还有七十多个工厂为它制造各种材料和设备。
    明年这四个工厂工程的施工任务将要比今年大四倍多。为了保证明年计划的实现，各厂已积极进行明年施工前的各项准备工作。第一汽车制造厂九月份开始就从设计、施工、材料、设备等各方面进行准备，现在一九五四年基本建设计划业已编好。其他三个厂也都在紧张地进行冬季施工与室内的机器安装工程，以及在施工附属企业中制造着各种预制件，并积极准备迎接明年新的任务。
