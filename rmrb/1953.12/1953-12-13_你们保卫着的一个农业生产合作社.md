To the Beloved Volunteer Army Comrades:

　　In October, I went to Xizhanglian Village in Jie County, Shanxi Province, on some business. This village is located in the middle section of the Zhongtiao Mountains and is a cotton-producing area. When I arrived, I happened to meet the members of the Yang Shijun Agricultural Production Cooperative harvesting cotton. They asked me to write a letter to you, telling you all about the cooperative's situation. I was really happy to do so.

　　At this time last year, their agricultural production cooperative was still a mutual aid team. In production, they realized more and more the benefits of being organized. Later, they also studied Li Shunda's article about visiting the Soviet Union in the newspaper, and their thinking became clearer. They believed that only further organization was the path for farmers to a happy life and could better support our country's economic construction. After a long period of discussion and research, on the first day of our country's first Five-Year Plan – January 1st of this year – the agricultural production cooperative was established. The cooperative has a total of 40 households, 223 people, and more than 1,100 mu of land. Although the cooperative has been established for less than a year, it has brought unprecedented harvests and a good life to its members. In April this year, when cotton began to be planted, they studied the land in the cooperative. Land suitable for planting cotton was planted with cotton; land suitable for planting grain was set aside for grain. The labor force was also divided according to the strengths of the members. For example, Wang Wending was good at feeding livestock, so he was allowed to feed livestock; Wang Yongsheng had good techniques, so he specialized in researching cultivation techniques. In July, the farm work was all crowded together, having to pick cotton, turn over wheat fields, and hoe grain... In previous years, they always took care of this and neglected that, taking care of picking cotton and missing the hoeing of grain. This year was completely different. With more people, it was convenient to allocate labor, so no work was delayed. All 200+ mu of cotton were watered three or four times, picked three or four times, and topdressing fertilizer and spraying were also timely. The cotton grew plump and healthy, the plants were tall, and there were many bolls, with at least 17 or 18 on each plant. The red stems, green leaves, and snow-white cotton, looked like a colorful carpet from a distance! This year, the whole cooperative picked more than 124,440 jin of seed cotton! In addition to grain and sideline occupations, this year the total income of the cooperative can reach 345.5 million yuan. After deducting all production investments, each work-day can be divided into more than 19,500 yuan. The income of an ordinary member is more than 70% higher than last year!

　　The income of the members, in addition to a large part being invested in reproduction, is used to add farm tools and improve life. The cooperative's livestock pen originally only held 29 head of livestock, but now it is being gradually increased, with plans to increase it to 39 head. Two months ago, the cooperative bought a new cotton gin, 15 new iron shovels, and six sprayers, and also collectively bought more than 260 zhang of fine cloth and printed cloth. More than a dozen families sewed new cotton quilts. Some young men and women bought woolen sweaters, some bought sweaters, and some bought rain boots.

　　In order to tell you more details about the lives of the members, I made a special trip to the home of Wang Haoshou, a member of the cooperative. His family has a total of four people. After joining the cooperative, he did more than 370 work-days and can be divided into more than 7.3 million yuan; the shares of land also earned about 2.5 million yuan, plus sweet potatoes, alfalfa, etc., the total income exceeded 10 million yuan, more than 7 million yuan higher than last year's income. His expenses were: more than 1 million yuan for grain tax, more than 1 million yuan for buying food, 4 million yuan for buying mules... the rest was deposited in the People's Bank. It wasn't very cold yet, but his family bought more than eight zhang of cloth and made two new quilts. Shiny glass windows have also been installed in Haoshou's house! As for eating, it would be no problem for his family to eat white flour every meal. However, in order to save, to support our country's industrial construction, and to support you, they have decided to eat more coarse grains and less fine grains.

　　Comrades, when it comes to increasing production and practicing economy, supporting our country's construction, and supporting you, the members really have the drive. They had already calculated the detailed accounts, to increase production and practice economy to the tune of 40,063,800 yuan in wealth, and most of it has already been realized. They carried out late-stage leaf picking and branch removal in the 93 mu of key irrigated cotton fields, and also made sure to pick the cotton clean, without losing a boll. As a result, they increased their income by more than 6.4 million yuan and picked an additional 1,002 jin of lint cotton. When harvesting grain, they also made sure not to lose a穗 in the field or a plant on the threshing ground. The 130 mu of grain yielded an extra 260 jin. This year, 400 mu of wheat fields were densely planted, eliminating the phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken ridges. If there are no accidents, it will yield at least 12 shi of wheat. In addition, the members all eat a combination of coarse and fine grains, planning to save the country more than 400 shi of wheat by next April, and also save themselves more than 9 million yuan. Adding the income from sideline production and saving some unnecessary expenses, the total can increase production and save 40,063,800 yuan in wealth!

　　A few days ago, the members saw the propaganda of our country's general line for the transition period in the newspaper. Everyone's minds became more enlightened, and the enthusiasm for completing the plan to increase production and practice economy became even greater. They picked the cotton clean and sold it to the country, supporting our motherland's economic construction and supporting your just struggle!

### 你们保卫着的一个农业生产合作社

    你们保卫着的一个农业生产合作社
    鲁文敬爱的志愿军同志们：
    十月间，我有事到了山西解县西张联村。这个村子靠近中条山的中段，是个出产棉花的地方。去时，正碰上杨士俊农业生产合作社的社员们在收棉花，他们叫我给你们写一封信，把社里的情况都告诉你们。我真感到高兴。
      去年这个时候，他们的农业生产合作社还是个互助组呢。在生产中，他们对组织起来的好处越体会越多，后来又在报纸上学习了李顺达到苏联参观的文章，思想更明确了，认为只有进一步组织起来，才是农民走向幸福生活的道路，才能更好地支援咱们国家的经济建设。经过长期的讨论和研究，就在咱们国家进入第一个五年建设计划的头一天——今年一月一日，成立了农业生产合作社。全社共有四十户，二百二十三口人，一千一百多亩土地。合作社成立到现在，虽然还不到一年，却给社员们带来了从来没有过的丰收和美好的生活。今年四月，棉花开始下种时，他们把社里的土地都研究了一下，适于种棉花的，就种棉花；适于种谷子的，就留下种谷子。劳动力也是一样，按社员的长处，进行了分工。比如，王稳定喂牲口好，就让他喂牲口；王永生的技术好，就专门研究耕作技术。七月里，庄稼活都挤在一块了，又要打卡棉花，又要翻耕麦地，又要锄谷子……。要是往年呀，总是顾了这个，顾不了那个，顾了打卡棉花，就误了锄谷子。今年就全不一样了，人多，劳动力调配着方便，那样活也没误了时。二百多亩棉花全都浇了三、四遍，打卡了三、四次，上追肥，打药水也很及时。棉花长得都是肥头大脑的，棵子又高，桃子又多，每棵足有十七八个。红的茎，绿的叶，雪白的棉花，远远看去，就好像一块五颜六色的大花毯一样！今年全社摘了十二万四千四百四十多斤籽棉！再加上谷子、副业，今年全社可收入三亿四千五百多万元，除生产上的一切投资外，每个劳动日可分到一万九千五百多元。一个普通社员的收入，就超过去年的百分之七十还要多！
    社员们的收入，除了很大一部分投入再生产外，就拿来添购农具和改善生活。社里的牲口圈，原来只拴着二十九头牲口，现在已在陆续增加，计划要增加到三十九头。两个月前，社里新买了一部轧花机、十五张新铁锹，六台喷水器，还集体买了二百六十多丈细布和花布。十几家都缝了新棉被，年青的小伙子们，姑娘们，有的买了绒衣，有的买了毛衣，有的买了雨鞋。
    为了更详细地告诉你们社员们的生活，我特地到社员王好收的家里走了一趟。他家共有四口人，入社后，做了三百七十多个劳动日，可分到七百三十多万元；土地入的股，也分到了二百五十万元左右，加上红薯、苜蓿等，总收入一千万元还出头，超过去年收入的七百多万元。他的开支是：交公粮一百多万元，买口粮一百多万元，买骡子四百万元……，剩下的，都存到人民银行里了。天还不很冷，家里就拉了八丈多布，做了两床新被子。好收的房子里，也装上了亮闪闪的玻璃窗了！要说是吃，他家顿顿吃白面都不成问题。可是，他们为了节约，为了支援咱们国家的工业建设，为了支援你们，已决定多吃粗粮，少吃细粮了。
    同志们，要是说起增产节约，支援咱们国家的建设，支援你们，社员们可真是有股劲头。他们早就算好了细账，要增产节约四千零六十三万八千元的财富，并且大部分已经实现了。他们在九十三亩重点水地棉花中进行了后期打卡大叶，打空枝的工作，还做到了把棉花摘净，不丢一瓣，结果，增加了六百四十多万元的收入，还多摘了一千零二斤皮棉。收谷子时，他们也做到了地里不丢一穗，场里不丢一棵，一百三十亩谷子，就多收了二百六十斤。今年的四百亩麦田，都实行了密植，消灭了缺苗断垄现象，要是没啥意外，足能多打十二石麦子。另外，社员们都是粗粮、细粮合吃，打算到明年四月，给国家节省四百多石小麦，还能给自己节省九百多万元。再加上副业生产所得和节余一些不必要的开支，统统算起来，足可以增产节约四千零六十三万八千元的财富！
    前几天，社员们从报纸上看到了咱们国家过渡时期总路线的宣传，大家的心眼更开朗了，完成增产节约计划的劲头也更大了。他们把棉花拣得干干净净的，卖给了国家，支援咱们祖国的经济建设，支援你们的正义斗争！
