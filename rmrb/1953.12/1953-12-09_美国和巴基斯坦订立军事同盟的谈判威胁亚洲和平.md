According to various sources, under the instigation of the United States, Pakistan and the United States are conducting negotiations on the conclusion of a US-Pakistan military alliance; at the same time, the United States is trying to rope in Pakistan in an attempt to establish a Middle East aggression bloc. All Asian people are paying close attention to this development.

On November 30, 1953, the Soviet government sent a note to the Pakistani government, hoping that the Pakistani government would explain the issue of concluding a military alliance with the United States and participating in the Middle East aggression bloc. The note pointed out: "The Soviet government cannot remain indifferent to the news about the above-mentioned negotiations, because the conclusion of an agreement stipulating the establishment of air force bases by the United States in Pakistani territory—that is, in areas close to the Soviet border—and Pakistan's participation in the plan to establish the above-mentioned group in the Middle East, have a direct impact on Soviet security." Our people have the same deep concern about the issues raised in the Soviet note.

Due to the Soviet government's note and the powerful exposure of the United States' conspiracy in Pakistan by broad Asian public opinion, the United States government is trying its best to cover up its activities and dilute the attention of the Asian people to the US-Pakistan military alliance negotiations. On December 1, the US State Department spokesman once again denied the fact that the United States and Pakistan were conducting negotiations on the conclusion of a military alliance. However, it is well known that the US war group has long wanted to drag Pakistan into the Middle East and Southeast Asian aggression organizations planned by the United States and turn it into an important US military base in the region. US Secretary of State Dulles' "visit" to Pakistan in May this year, as well as the frequent appearance of US generals and congressmen in Pakistan later, are closely related to the activities of concluding a US-Pakistan military alliance. Recently, US President Dwight Eisenhower held talks with Pakistani Governor-General Ghulam Muhammad in Washington. The "New York Times" of the United States admitted: "The main content of their talks was to study the possibility of concluding a military alliance between Pakistan and the United States." American newspapers also revealed that the Eisenhower administration is planning to supply Pakistan with 250 million US dollars worth of military materials every year, so that Pakistan's army can be expanded from 250,000 to 1 million. As a condition for "assistance," the United States will have the right to establish military bases in both East and West Pakistan.

This deal carried out by the US war group in Pakistan is part of its conspiracy to step up aggression in Asia. The United States attempts to incorporate the "military potential" of this Asian country into its own strategic plan in order to realize its vicious conspiracy of so-called "Asians fighting Asians." The United States is also urging Pakistan to conclude an alliance with Turkey, a member of the Atlantic Alliance, to split the relationship between Pakistan and other Islamic countries, so as to oppress those Arab countries that are unwilling to participate in the US aggression organization. On the other hand, Pakistan's territory is located between the Middle East and Southeast Asia, and is composed of East and West parts, making its strategic position extremely coveted by the US war group. It is trying to use Pakistan to link the US aggression forces extending into the Middle East and those extending into Southeast Asia, so as to form a US aggression "system" from the Middle East to the Far East, posing a greater threat to the peace-loving people of Asia. These conspiracies of the United States cannot but arouse high vigilance among the Pakistani people and the Asian people. India's "Today's News" pointed out: "If Pakistan signs this treaty with the United States, it will not only bring crisis to its people, but also threaten the Middle East countries, India, and Southeast Asian countries." "Burma's New Era News" also said that if the US "military base plan in Pakistan is realized due to the discussions being carried out, Asia will become tense."

The United States calls such a US-Pakistan military alliance for the purpose of "defense," which is obviously an extremely absurd deceptive statement. The US border is not in Pakistan, and no one will believe that the United States needs to establish military bases in other countries' territories thousands of miles away for its own security. Agence France-Presse revealed that senior US military authorities are doing their best to exaggerate the conclusion of a military alliance with Pakistan, so that "the US Air Force Strategic Command can obtain air force bases, so that once a war occurs, the Soviet industrial center in Central Asia will be within the range of the US Air Force." If the Pakistani government accepts this military alliance, it means introducing war to its own doorstep and turning its own territory into one of the war springboards for US adventurers who attempt to launch World War III. This is of course fundamentally contrary to the wishes of the peace-loving Pakistani people. The recent protest movement of the Pakistani people against the signing of the US-Pakistan military alliance fully demonstrates their firm and unwavering will to love peace and their motherland.

Everyone knows that along with US military "assistance" comes the US wanton violation of the sovereignty of the countries it "assists," interference in the politics and diplomacy of these countries, plundering of the economy and resources of these countries, and enslavement of the people of these countries, resulting in these countries falling into a deep national crisis. This situation is not without precedents in Western Europe, Latin America, and Australia. As far as Pakistan is concerned, US "assistance" will not only fail to solve Pakistan's financial and economic problems, but will only increase the burden on the Pakistani government as it is forced by the US war preparation policy, bringing great pain to the Pakistani people.

If the US-Pakistan military alliance is concluded, it will inevitably pose a great threat to the security of Pakistan's neighbors, especially India and Burma. The current East and West parts of Pakistan are on both sides of India. The establishment of US military bases here is tantamount to establishing military bases on India's two wings. If you add the military bases that the United States intends to establish in Goa and Trincomalee, Portuguese territories in India and Ceylon, it will constitute a political and military encirclement of India. Of course, no sovereign country can tolerate such a fact. Recently, Indian Prime Minister Nehru expressed great attention to the negotiations on the US-Pakistan military alliance in his speech. The broad Indian public opinion is even more extremely indignant at this aggressive action of the United States. This is completely understandable.

Undoubtedly, if the US-Pakistan military alliance is concluded, it will bring extremely bad effects to the relationship between Pakistan and India. The United States does not want to see Pakistan and India resolve the disputes that are still pending through consultation, especially the dispute over Kashmir, but adopts the method of dragging Pakistan into the US military group to deepen the tension between the two countries. People know that in August this year, Indian Prime Minister Nehru and Pakistani Prime Minister Muhammad Ali held talks in Karachi and Delhi on the peaceful settlement of the Kashmir issue and other disputes between India and Pakistan, and achieved good results. This achievement has been warmly supported by the people of India and Pakistan and praised by world opinion. However, due to the obstruction and sabotage of the United States, the efforts to resolve the Kashmir issue have still not made progress. And now, the US-instigated activities of Pakistan and the United States to conclude a military alliance will obviously complicate the disputes between India and Pakistan, and create more obstacles on the road to resolving the Kashmir issue through consultation. If this provocative action by the United States is not stopped, the long-standing painful experiences of the people of Pakistan and India will only deepen, and will have a great impact on the entire Asian situation.

If anyone thinks that the United States is trying to conclude a military alliance with Pakistan as a kind of "support" for Pakistan on the Kashmir issue, then they are very wrong. Taking advantage of the convenience of the US-Pakistan military alliance, the United States will only further extend its influence into Kashmir and seize this strategic location close to China and the Soviet Union. Therefore, if the US-Pakistan military alliance is concluded, it will be very harmful to Pakistan and India. It is in the common interest of Pakistan and India to unite, resolutely oppose US aggression, oppose US military treaties, and insist on resolving all pending disputes in a spirit of consultation rather than with "strength."

The Chinese people are watching the activities of the United States and Pakistan to conclude a military alliance. Pakistani territory, whether east or west, is close to our southwestern border. The Chinese people must not ignore the US attempt to establish military bases in this region and create hotbeds of war and sources of international disputes. The Chinese people firmly support international peace and resolutely oppose the US imperialist policy of aggression and the policy of creating tensions everywhere. We firmly oppose the activities of the US and Pakistan to conclude a military alliance. We believe that as long as the Asian people unite closely and fight resolutely for the peace and security of the Asian people, they will surely defeat any aggressive plans of imperialism.

### 美国和巴基斯坦订立军事同盟的谈判威胁亚洲和平

    美国和巴基斯坦订立军事同盟的谈判威胁亚洲和平
    根据各方消息，在美国的策动下，巴基斯坦和美国正在进行关于订立美巴军事同盟的谈判；同时，美国正拉拢巴基斯坦企图建立中东侵略集团。全亚洲人民都对这一事态的发展，予以极大的注意。
    一九五三年十一月三十日，苏联政府照会巴基斯坦政府，希望巴基斯坦政府对于和美国订立军事同盟以及参加中东侵略集团问题加以说明。照会中指出：“苏联政府不能对关于上述谈判的消息采取不闻不问的态度，因为缔结规定美国在巴基斯坦境内——即靠近苏联边境的地区——建立空军基地的协定，以及巴基斯坦参加在中东成立上述集团的计划，都对苏联安全有直接影响。”我国人民对于苏联照会中所提出的问题抱有同样深切的关怀。
    由于苏联政府的照会以及亚洲的广大舆论有力地揭露了美国在巴基斯坦的阴谋，美国政府正极力掩饰它的活动，企图冲淡亚洲人民对于美巴军事同盟谈判的注意力。十二月一日，美国国务院发言人再次否认美国和巴基斯坦进行关于订立军事同盟谈判的事实。但是，人所共知，长久以来美国战争集团就想把巴基斯坦拉进美国所策划的中东和东南亚侵略组织中，并把它变为美国在这一地区的重要军事基地。今年五月美国国务卿杜勒斯“访问”巴基斯坦，以及后来美国将军和议员们在巴基斯坦的频繁出现，都是和订立美巴军事同盟的活动有密切关系的。最近，美国总统艾森豪威尔更和巴基斯坦总督吴拉姆·穆罕默德在华盛顿举行了会谈。美国“纽约时报”承认：“他们会谈的主要内容是研究在巴基斯坦和美国订立军事同盟的可能性问题。”美国报刊并透露，艾森豪威尔政府正计划每年以二亿五千万美元的军火供给巴基斯坦，使巴基斯坦的陆军能够从二十五万人扩充为一百万人。作为“援助”的条件，美国将有权在巴基斯坦的东西两部建立军事基地。
    美国战争集团在巴基斯坦进行的这一个勾当，是它在亚洲加紧侵略的阴谋计划的一部分。美国企图把这个亚洲国家的“军事潜力”纳入自己的战略计划中，以便实现它所谓“亚洲人打亚洲人”的恶毒阴谋。美国并正促使巴基斯坦和大西洋联盟成员之一的土耳其缔结同盟，分化巴基斯坦和其他伊斯兰教国家的关系，借以压迫那些不愿意参加美国侵略组织的阿拉伯国家。另一方面，巴基斯坦的领土位于中东和东南亚之间，又由东、西两部所组成，这样的战略地位使美国战争集团十分垂涎。它力图利用巴基斯坦，把美国伸入中东的侵略势力和伸入东南亚的侵略势力连结起来，以便构成从中东直到远东的美国侵略“体系”，造成对亚洲爱好和平人民的更大威胁。美国的这些阴谋不能不引起巴基斯坦人民和亚洲人民的高度警惕。印度“今天报”指出：“如果巴基斯坦和美国签订这个条约，那末不仅会给它的人民带来危机，而且也会威胁到中东国家、印度和东南亚国家。”“缅甸新时代报”也说：如果美国在“巴基斯坦的军事基地计划因所传进行的讨论而实现的话，亚洲就要紧张起来。”
    美国把这样的一个美巴军事同盟说成是为了“防御”的目的，显然是极其荒谬的欺人之谈。美国的国境线并不在巴基斯坦，没有人会相信美国为了安全竟需要到万里之外的他国领土上建立军事基地。法新社透露，美国高级军事当局尽力渲染它和巴基斯坦缔结军事同盟，是为了“美国空军战略司令部可以获得空军基地，那末一旦发生战争，苏联在亚洲中部的工业中心就在美国空军的航程之内。”如果巴基斯坦政府接受了这个军事同盟，那就意味着把战争引进自己的门口，把自己的国土变为美国冒险家妄图发动第三次世界大战的战争跳板之一。这当然是和爱好和平的巴基斯坦人民的愿望根本违背的。
    谁都知道，随着美国的军事“援助”而俱来的，就是美国肆意侵犯受它“援助”的国家的主权，干涉这些国家的政治和外交，掠夺这些国家的经济和资源，奴役这些国家的人民，结果就使这些国家陷于深重的民族危机中。这种情况，在西欧，在拉丁美洲，在澳大利亚，都不乏前车之鉴。就巴基斯坦来说，美国的“援助”不但不能解决巴基斯坦的财政经济问题，反而只会随着美国备战政策的逼迫，使巴基斯坦政府的负担日益加重，给巴基斯坦人民带来极大痛苦。最近巴基斯坦人民反对签订美巴军事同盟的抗议运动，充分表现了他们爱和平、爱祖国的坚定不移的意志。
    美巴军事同盟如果订立，必然将对巴基斯坦的邻国，首先是印度和缅甸的安全，造成莫大的威胁。巴基斯坦现在的东西两部正处于印度的两侧，美国在这里建立军事基地，无异于在印度的两翼建立军事基地，如果再加上美国企图在印度境内的葡萄牙属地果阿和锡兰亭可马里建立的军事基地，就将构成对印度在政治上和军事上的一种包围。任何一个主权国家，当然都不能容忍这样的事实。最近印度总理尼赫鲁在谈话中就对美巴军事同盟的谈判表示了极大的注意。印度广大舆论更对美国的这种侵略行动感到异常愤慨。这是完全可以理解的。
    无疑地，美巴军事同盟如果订立，必将给巴基斯坦和印度两国之间的关系，带来极其恶劣的影响。美国根本不希望看到巴印两国通过协商方式解决现在仍然悬而未决的争端，首先是关于克什米尔的争端，而是采取把巴基斯坦拉进美国军事集团的办法，来加深两国之间的紧张局势。人们知道，今年八月间，印度总理尼赫鲁和巴基斯坦总理穆罕默德·阿里曾经在喀喇蚩和德里举行了关于印巴两国和平解决克什米尔问题及其他争端的会谈，并且获得了良好的成就。这个成就得到印巴两国人民的热烈支持和世界舆论的赞扬。但是由于美国的阻挠和破坏，就使关于解决克什米尔问题的努力仍然没有进展。而现在，美国策动巴基斯坦和美国订立军事同盟的活动，显然将使巴印之间的纠纷更加复杂化，使协商解决克什米尔问题的道路上发生更多的障碍。如果不制止美国这种挑拨行动，巴印两国人民长久以来的痛苦经历只会加深下去，并对整个亚洲局势发生极大的危害。
    如果有人以为美国力图和巴基斯坦订立军事同盟，是美国在克什米尔问题上对巴基斯坦的一种
  “支持”，那就大错而特错了。美国借着美巴军事同盟的便利条件，只会更进一步地把它的势力伸入克什米尔，把这个靠近中国和苏联的战略要地攫为己有。因此，美巴军事同盟如果订立，不论对巴基斯坦，不论对印度，都是十分有害的。巴基斯坦和印度两国团结起来，坚决反对美国的侵略，反对美国的军事条约，坚持用协商精神而非用“实力”来解决一切悬而未决的争端，才是符合两国的共同利益的。
    中国人民正在注视着美国和巴基斯坦订立军事同盟的活动。巴基斯坦的领土，不论是东部还是西部，都与我国的西南边疆接近。美国企图在这一地区建立军事基地，制造战争温床和国际纠纷的策源地，我国人民是一定不能漠视的。我国人民坚决拥护国际和平，坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和到处制造紧张局势的政策。我们坚决反对美巴订立军事同盟的活动。我们相信只要亚洲人民紧密团结，为亚洲人民的和平与安全而坚决斗争，就一定能够击败帝国主义的任何侵略计划。
