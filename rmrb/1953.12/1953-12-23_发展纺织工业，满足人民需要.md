    The recovery and development of China's textile industry over the past four years have been very rapid. By 1952, the annual output of major textile products had far exceeded the highest level in China's history. Cotton yarn increased by 51% compared to the highest annual output in Chinese history; cotton cloth increased by 67%; gunny sacks increased by 87%; and the output of other industries such as woolen textiles, silk weaving, and hosiery also increased significantly compared to the early days of liberation. These achievements of the textile industry have provided a strong guarantee for the gradual improvement of the people's lives in our country.
    Although China's textile industry has developed considerably in the past four years, it is still inadequate for a large country with a population of over 500 million. Comrade Stalin said: "When examining the economic strength of a country's industry, one should not only look at the general industrial output without considering the size of the domestic population, but rather pay attention to the comparison between industrial output and domestic per capita consumption. The more industrial products allocated per capita in a country, the higher the country's economic strength. Conversely, the fewer industrial products allocated per capita in a country, the lower the country and its industry's economic strength." So, what is the proportion of textile production per capita in our country now? In the Soviet Union in 1928, the first year of the first five-year plan, the average national output of cotton fabrics was about 20.1 meters per person per year. In our country this year, calculating the total yarn production as fabric, the average is only 9 meters per person, more than half of what it was in the Soviet Union 25 years ago. This means that China's textile industry is far from meeting the needs of China's huge market, which accounts for a quarter of the world's population. In recent years, with the gradual improvement of the material lives of the Chinese people, the demand for textiles from the masses, especially the vast number of farmers, has been growing rapidly. If we take the national sales figures for yarn and cloth in 1949 as 100, then 1950 was about 126%; 1951 was about 148%; and 1952 was about 162%. According to the current situation, it is estimated to be about 230% of 1949 this year. Obviously, the rapid growth of people's needs has formed a great contradiction with the current situation of China's textile industry. If we do not pay attention to solving this contradiction as soon as possible, we may affect the improvement of people's lives due to the insufficient supply of textiles, which may affect the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance and the normal progress of national construction.
    How to solve this contradiction? That is, while ensuring that the main force is used to build heavy industry, we must also develop the textile industry accordingly. To this end, the state has decided to allocate a considerable proportion of funds during the first five-year plan to rapidly develop the textile industry. After the completion of this construction plan, China's cotton textile industry equipment will increase by more than 50% compared to the present, and the woolen, silk, hemp, and other textile industries will also have an appropriate increase. This is a very wise measure. This is great good news for the people of the whole country. For all textile industry workers, this is a glorious and arduous task.
    To develop the textile industry, we first need to build many new factories. Only by actively building a certain number of textile factories in the next few years can we rapidly increase textile production. At the same time, planned construction of large-scale state-owned textile factories will ensure the steady growth of China's socialist proportion. Therefore, it has extremely important political and economic significance. The construction of new factories must be based on needs and possibilities, and the principle of focusing on key development must be implemented. The construction of the textile industry should focus on the cotton textile industry, which plays a leading role, because the people's demand for cotton textiles is greater than that for other textiles. At the same time, according to the characteristics of China's resources, silk weaving industry should be appropriately developed to replace certain high-end varieties of cotton textile products. And in accordance with the principle of supply, production, and sales balance, appropriately develop wool, hemp, rayon and other industries. It is certainly wrong to try to revive everything at once and not implement the principle of focusing on key development; but it is also wrong if we do not pay appropriate attention to the development of other textile sectors according to needs and possibilities.
    In order to ensure the smooth progress of the construction of new factories, the relevant leading departments of the textile industry must quickly start to formulate specific construction plans, and comprehensively consider raw material supply, product sales, and other conditions. At the same time, we should actively strengthen the forces of basic construction and machinery manufacturing, especially the technical forces of design, construction, and machinery manufacturing, to meet the needs of the annual progress of basic construction; we should actively and systematically strengthen the training of technical personnel and technical workers in existing enterprises to meet the needs of the start of production in newly built enterprises. We must also actively learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and promote domestic advanced experience to improve the quality and technical level of basic construction work. When studying the layout of new factories, we should build new textile industry bases in the hinterland of our country, close to raw material producing areas and vast rural markets, and with convenient transportation, in accordance with the principle of economic rationality, to gradually change the unreasonable situation of the textile industry being concentrated in coastal areas.
    While the state invests in the centralized construction of national new factories, local industrial departments in various regions can also, depending on the specific needs and possibilities of raw material supply, sales market, and other specific conditions, and the political and economic significance, focus on developing some textile industries that the central Ministry of Textile Industry temporarily lacks, to supplement the shortcomings of state-owned industries. This is also necessary.
    Continuing to tap the potential of existing factories is also an important aspect of developing the textile industry. In recent years, existing textile factories across the country, especially state-owned factories, have made great efforts to tap their potential in order to meet the needs of the people. At present, the equipment utilization rate of state-owned factories has generally reached a relatively high level. But it would be wrong to be complacent because of this, or even to have the conservative idea that the potential has been almost fully tapped. In fact, the possibility of taking a further step on the basis of the existing production level of textile factories in various regions is completely there. For example, those that have not yet implemented a three-shift production system can switch to three shifts, which will generally increase production by about 15% or more; those that have implemented a three-shift system can start by strengthening machine maintenance and conservation work to reduce the rate of downtime and stoppage. As for factories with poor planning management and technical management, they should strive to improve the balance of plan completion, strengthen technical organizational measures, continue to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, implement and consolidate the "Hao Jianxiu Work Method", the "1951 Weaving Work Method" and the "1953 Conservation Work Method" and conservation work system, further improve labor organization, increase the enthusiasm of technical personnel and the creativity of all employees, and carry out labor competitions and rationalization proposal movements, to achieve increased production, improved quality, reduced costs, and increased labor productivity. Factories with spare factory buildings or unbalanced front and rear processes, and factories with overly old equipment can be expanded, adjusted, repaired, supplemented, and utilized in accordance with the principle of small investment and large returns to fully tap their potential and accumulate more funds for the country.
    On the basis of exerting the potential of enterprises and improving production, the textile departments in various regions should also actively and effectively increase product varieties and improve product quality. In recent years, due to the improvement of people's living standards, consumers have also raised their requirements for the variety, quantity, and quality of textile products. They have raised criticisms and suggestions on the fact that the textile industry departments do not have many varieties of products and that the quality of some products is not high. This kind of demand and opinion from the masses of the people is understandable. Now the central Ministry of Textile Industry and its subordinate bureaus have attached importance to this, and have formulated a draft of textile product quality standards, which is currently being piloted and summarized in key areas. At the same time, combined with the implementation of measures to strengthen planning management and technical management, the number of varieties has increased compared to before, the quality has also been improved, and the balance of plan completion has also improved. This is absolutely necessary. But it must be pointed out that all these improvement measures and preliminary achievements are still not enough, and we must continue to work hard to create more inexpensive and high-quality varieties and improve product quality to meet the needs of the masses of the people.
    Private enterprises account for a considerable proportion of China's textile industry. According to the general line of the state during the transition period, gradually realizing the socialist transformation of private textile industry through the form of state capitalism is a major task of the textile administrative departments. Since liberation, the state's leadership over the private textile industry has been relatively strong. The people's government has helped them solve various difficulties in different periods in a timely manner, and has implemented unified distribution of various textile raw materials such as cotton, wool, raw hemp, and silk. Various methods such as unified purchase, processing, ordering, or sales have been adopted for their products, which has already led most private textile factories onto the path of state capitalism. Their production is also gradually being incorporated into the national plan, generally overcoming blindness; the vast majority of private textile factories have also obtained a certain degree of profit. Some private factories have implemented joint state-private ownership at the request of the capitalists. After joint state-private ownership, these factories have carried out various reforms and adopted new management systems, thereby improving production and developing business, and playing a certain role in ensuring social supply. For example, Shanghai Xinhe, Dingxin and other yarn factories and Xinguang Underwear Factory were unable to maintain production due to poor management and continuous losses before joint state-private ownership. After joint state-private ownership, management was improved, and they turned from loss to profit. Production is thriving, shareholders have received dividends and bonuses, and the lives and welfare of employees have been further improved. After the joint state-private ownership of Huaxin Textile Factory in Tangshan, North China, its annual profits and its business management level were much higher than those of other private textile factories in North China. These facts powerfully illustrate that state capitalist enterprises are far superior to private enterprises. Now, more and more industrialists in the private textile industry understand the advantages of state capitalism. They have begun to realize that this is a bright road for industrialists and businessmen who are striving to implement the general line during the transition period. In the future, the textile administrative departments should continue to strengthen their leadership over the private textile industry, and encourage and guide the private textile industry to embark on the track of state capitalism and national planning in a step-by-step and planned manner according to needs and possibilities.
    The tasks undertaken by the textile industry are significant. All employees and leading cadres of the textile industry departments must strive to improve their political and ideological and technical and business levels, overcome conservative ideas, and not be proud of the achievements they have already made. We should continue to work hard to find tricks, tap potential, improve enterprise management level, and further improve labor productivity to increase production, improve quality, and reduce costs, and strive to complete the production increase and cost reduction plan and welcome new construction tasks.

### 发展纺织工业，满足人民需要

    发展纺织工业，满足人民需要
    我国纺织工业四年来的恢复和发展是很迅速的，到一九五二年为止，纺织工业主要产品的年产量，已远远超过了我国历史上的最高水平。棉纱比我国历史最高年产量增加百分之五十一；棉布增加百分之六十七；麻袋增加百分之八十七；其余如毛纺织、丝织和复制针织等业的产量也比解放初期有很大的提高。纺织工业的这些成就，为我国人民生活的逐步改善提供了有力的保证。
    我国纺织工业四年来虽然有了相当的发展，但是对于我们这样一个拥有五亿以上人口的大国来说，却仍然是不相适应的。斯大林同志说过：“在考察一国工业底经济实力时，不要单看一般工业出产量，不顾及国内人口多少，而是要注意到工业出产量与国内每人消费额间的对比情形。一个国家按人口平均分配时落到每人份上的工业出产品愈多，这个国家的经济实力也愈高，反过来说，一个国家按人口平均分配时落到每人份上的工业出产品愈少，这个国家和它的工业底经济实力也愈低。”那么，现在我国纺织品的产量按人口分配的比例究竟怎样呢？苏联在一九二八年时，也就是第一个五年计划的第一年，棉织品的产量全国平均每人每年约为二○·一公尺，而我国今年的产纱量全以织物计算，每人平均还只能达到九公尺，比二十五年以前的苏联相差一倍多。这也就是说：我国纺织工业还远远不能适应我国这个占有世界四分之一人口的巨大市场的需要。近年来，随着我国人民物质生活的逐步改善，人民群众，特别是广大农民，对纺织品的需要量正在迅速增长，如以一九四九年全国纱布销售数字为一百，则一九五○年约为百分之一二六；一九五一年约为百分之一四八；一九五二年约为百分之一六二，按照目前情况预计，今年约为一九四九年的百分之二三○左右。显然，人民需要的迅速增长，已经与我国纺织工业的现状形成了很大的矛盾，如果我们不及早地来注意解决这个矛盾，那么我们就可能因为纺织品的不能充分供应而影响人民生活的改善，就可能影响到工农联盟的巩固和国家建设工作的正常进行。
    如何解决这个矛盾呢？这就是在保证主要力量建设重工业的前提之下，同时必须相应地发展纺织工业。为此，国家已决定在第一个五年计划期间，拨出相当比重的资金，迅速的发展纺织工业。在完成了这个建设计划之后，我国棉纺织工业设备将比现在增加百分之五十以上，毛、丝、麻等纺织工业亦将有一个适当的增长。这是一个十分英明的措施。这对于全国人民是一个重大的喜讯。对于全体纺织工业工作者来说，是一项光荣而艰巨的任务。
    发展纺织工业，首先需要建设许多新的工厂。我们只有在几年内积极建设起一定数量的纺织工厂，才能使纺织产品迅速增长，同时，有计划地建设较大规模的国营纺织工厂，将保证我国社会主义比重的稳步增长。因此，它有着极其重大的政治意义与经济意义。建设新厂必须根据需要与可能，贯彻重点发展的方针。建设纺织工业中应以起着主导作用的棉纺织工业为重点，因为人民对于棉纺织品的需要量，要比其他纺织品为多。但与此同时，应根据我国的资源特点，适当地发展丝织工业，以代替棉纺织产品中的某些高级品种。并按照供、产、销平衡的原则，适当地发展毛、麻、人造纤维等工业。企图百废俱兴，不贯彻重点发展的方针固然是错误的；但如果不按照需要与可能，适当注意其他纺织部门的发展，也是不对的。
    为了保证新厂建设工作的顺利进行，纺织工业的有关领导部门，必须迅速着手制订具体的建设方案，通盘考虑原料供应、产品销售，以及其他条件。同时，应积极加强基本建设与机械制造的力量，特别是设计、施工和机械制造的技术力量，以适应基本建设逐年进度的需要；应积极地有计划地在现有企业中加强培养技术人员和技术工人，以适应新建企业开工生产的需要。还必须积极学习苏联先进经验与推广国内先进经验，以提高基本建设工作的质量与技术水平。在研究新厂布局时，应根据经济合理的原则，在我国腹部选择紧靠原料产地与广大农村市场及交通便利的地区，建设新的纺织工业基地，以逐步改变纺织工业集中分布在沿海地区的这一不合理状况。
    在国家投资集中建设全国性的新厂同时，各地地方工业部门也可视原料供应、销售市场等具体条件的需要与可能，以及在政治上经济上的意义，有重点地配合中央纺织工业部发展一些国家一时尚缺乏的纺织工业，以辅助国营工业的不足，这也是必要的。
    继续发挥现有工厂的潜在能力，也是发展纺织工业的一个重要方面。全国现有纺织工厂，特别是国营工厂，几年来为了供应人民需要，在发挥潜在能力方面，曾做了很大的努力，目前国营厂的设备利用率，一般已达到比较高的水准。但如果因此自满，甚至认为潜在能力已挖得差不多了的保守思想，则是不对的，事实上各地纺织工厂在现有生产水准的基础上继续提高一步的可能性是完全存在的，诸如凡尚未实行三班生产制的，可改开三班，这样一般将可增加产量约百分之十五以上；已实行三班制的，可从加强机器检修保全工作着手，减少停台停车率；至于计划管理与技术管理不好的工厂，则应努力提高完成计划的均衡性，加强技术组织措施，继续学习苏联先进经验，贯彻与巩固“郝建秀工作法”、“一九五一织布工作法”及“一九五三保全工作法”与保全工作制度，进一步改善劳动组织，提高技术人员的积极性与全体职工的创造性，开展劳动竞赛与合理化建议运动，以达到增加生产，提高质量，降低成本，提高劳动生产率；尚有空余厂房或前后工序不平衡、设备过分陈旧的工厂，可根据投资小收效大的原则，加以扩建、调整、修理、补充和利用，充分发挥潜力，为国家积累更多的资金。
    各地纺织部门在发挥企业潜在力量、提高生产的基础上，还应积极有效地增加产品品种与提高产品质量。近年来，由于人民生活水平的提高，消费者对纺织产品的品种数量与质量的要求也都提高了，他们曾对纺织工业部门产品的品种不多，和某些产品质量不高的现象，提出了批评和建议。人民群众的这种要求与意见，是可以理解的。现在中央纺织工业部及所属各局对此已加以重视，并制订了纺织产品质量标准草案，目前正在重点试行总结中。同时，结合贯彻加强计划管理与技术管理等措施，品种数量已较前增多，质量亦有改善与提高，完成计划的均衡性亦有进步，这是完全必要的。但必须指出：所有这些改进措施与初步成就，仍然是不够的，还必须继续努力，创造更多物美价廉的品种与提高产品质量，以适应人民群众需要。
    我国纺织工业中私营企业占着相当大的比重。根据国家过渡时期的总路线，通过国家资本主义的形式，对私营纺织业逐步实现社会主义改造，是纺织行政部门一项重大的任务。解放以来，国家对私营纺织工业的领导是比较有力的，人民政府曾及时帮助他们解决了不同时期的各种困难，对棉花、羊毛、原麻和蚕丝等各种纺织原料，实行了统筹分配，对其产品分别采取了统购、加工、定货或包销等办法，这样已经使大多数私营纺织厂走上了国家资本主义的道路，它们的生产也正在逐渐纳入国家计划的轨道，一般地克服了盲目性；极大多数私营纺织厂也都获得了一定程度的利润。一部分私营工厂在资方的要求下，实行了公私合营，这些工厂在公私合营以后，进行了各种改革，采取了新的管理制度，因而提高了生产，发展了业务，对保证社会供应起了一定的作用。例如上海信和、鼎新等纱厂及新光内衣厂，在公私合营前由于经营不善，连年亏本，已陷于无法维持生产的困境，公私合营后改善了经营管理，由亏本而转为盈余，生产情况欣欣向荣，股东分到了股息和红利，职工的生活福利也得到了进一步的改善。华北唐山华新纺织厂在公私合营以后，其逐年获得的盈利以及其企业经营管理水平，均远较华北区各私营纺织厂为高，这些事实都有力地说明了国家资本主义企业较之私营企业优越得多。现在，私营纺织业中的工业家们理解到国家资本主义的优点的人正日渐增多，他们已开始认识到这是为实现过渡时期总路线而努力的工商业者的光明大道。今后纺织行政部门应继续加强对私营纺织业的领导，根据需要与可能，有步骤、有计划地鼓励和引导私营纺织业走上国家资本主义和国家计划的轨道。
    纺织工业所担负的任务是重大的，纺织工业部门的全体职工和领导干部，必须努力提高自己的政治思想与技术业务水平，克服保守思想，不要为已经取得的若干成绩而骄傲。应当继续努力寻找窍门，挖掘潜力，提高企业管理水平，进一步提高劳动生产率，以增加产量、提高质量、降低成本，为完成增产节约计划，迎接新的建设任务而奋斗。
