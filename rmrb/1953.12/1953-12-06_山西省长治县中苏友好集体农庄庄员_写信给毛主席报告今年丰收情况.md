Respected Chairman Mao:
	We are writing to tell you about a great joy in our farm: we have had a bumper harvest! We were originally farmers from Wangcun, Guancun, Nanchui, and Zhuoma villages in Changzhi County, Shanxi Province. Under the leadership and assistance of the Party and the government, on the 35th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution last year, we learned from the example of Soviet farmers, worked collectively, and, based on the principle of distribution according to work, organized 918 households with 14,000 mu of land to establish the "China-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm." Over the past year, we have traversed many unfamiliar, difficult, and tortuous roads. After struggling against some conservative and skeptical ideas and old habits, we finally fundamentally changed the production relations and production habits of thousands of years of individual households. We cultivated the collective land as if we were cultivating our own land, treating the collective cause as our own. Everyone, while adhering to their own division of labor, also felt that they were working for the entire collective. Especially with the help of comrades working at the state tractor station, using tractors to plow the land, we saw the raw soil that had never been touched being turned over in the sunlight. More than 10,000 mu of cultivated land were plowed over by the "iron oxen" in just a few days, and then harrowed flat. Some of it was even sown with seeds evenly, saving us the strength of 100 laborers and more than 200 head of livestock. In this, we concretely felt the greatness of the worker elder brothers and the strength of the country.
	At first, we also suspected that the crops would not grow well when the raw soil was turned over. But today, again on the 36th anniversary of the great October Revolution, we have had a bumper harvest. Our production exceeded last year by 13.35%, exceeded the best mutual aid team in the village by 25.7%, and exceeded individual farmers by 43.4%. We received 100% labor remuneration. The best laboring households received more than 10,000 jin of grain, and generally they received 3,000 to 4,000 jin of grain. The facts shattered all doubts and rumors, proving the unparalleled superiority of the socialist collectivization system. The facts proved that the road pointed out by the Communist Party is the only correct one. The facts proved that only with national industrialization can we have more machines to help us, can we improve our production, improve our lives, and reduce our labor. Only under the leadership and help of the working class can we move towards a socialist society.
	Every actively working member of the farm feels extremely relaxed and happy. As long as we work hard, we will no longer have to worry about life, worry about not being able to afford a plough, or worry about not being able to arrange production properly. We are no longer accustomed to a person driving an ox to cultivate his own fragmented land, and we are no longer accustomed to calculating how to take advantage of others, find a busy job, or do a busy job for the sake of personal life and production. Dear Chairman Mao: We know that your heart is connected with ours, because our hearts are always closely following you. These victories were given by you and belong to you. We also know that this is just an attempt, just a beginning. Now we personally experience that the collective farm's distribution according to work is the road to prosperity. We firmly believe that next year's output will greatly exceed this year's and achieve a major bumper harvest.

	With the highest respect!

### 山西省长治县中苏友好集体农庄庄员  写信给毛主席报告今年丰收情况

    山西省长治县中苏友好集体农庄庄员
    写信给毛主席报告今年丰收情况敬爱的毛主席：
    把我们农庄的大喜事告诉你，我们丰收了。我们原来是山西省长治县王村、关村、南垂、捉马四个村的农民，在党和政府的领导和帮助下，于去年十月社会主义革命三十五周年纪念日，学习苏联农民的榜样，集体劳动，在按劳取酬的原则下，组织起九百一十八户人家，共有一万四千亩土地，成立了“中苏友好集体农庄”。一年来我们走过许多生疏、困难和曲折的道路，经过和一些保守、怀疑思想及旧习惯的斗争，我们终于翻天覆地地改变了几千年来一家一户的生产关系和生产习惯，耕种集体的土地就如耕种自己的土地一样，把集体的事业做为自己的事业，每个人在坚持自己的分工劳动里，也觉得这是为整个集体劳动着。尤其是在国家拖拉机站工作同志的帮助下，使用拖拉机耕地，我们看到将从未动过的生土翻扬在日光下，一万多亩耕地，在不多的几天中就让“铁牛”给耕翻了个身，又将它耙的平整，有的并撒上了均匀的种子，节省下我们一百个劳动力和二百多头牲口的力量，在这里面我们具体感到工人老大哥们的伟大和国家的力量。
    最初我们也怀疑过生土翻上来怕庄稼长不好，但是今天，又是在伟大的十月革命节三十六周年的节日里，我们丰收了，我们生产超过去年百分之十三点三五，比所在村最好的互助组超过了百分之二十五点七；比个体农民超过了百分之四十三点四。我们百分之百地得到劳动报酬，劳动最好的户得到一万多斤粮食，一般地也得三、四千斤粮食，事实打破一切怀疑和谣言，证明了社会主义集体化制度的无比优越性，事实证明了共产党指出的道路是唯一正确的，事实证明了只有国家工业化才有更多的机器帮助我们，才能提高我们的生产，改善我们的生活，减轻我们劳动，只有在工人阶级领导帮助下，我们才可以走向社会主义社会。
    我们每一个积极劳动的庄员都感到无比的轻松愉快，只要好好劳动，我们再也不会为着生活发愁，为合不上牛犋发愁，为着安排不好生产而发愁，我们已再不习惯一个人赶着牛去耕自己的零碎的土地，已不习惯为着个人生活、生产去盘算着如何沾点光，找个忙工，或去打个忙工的了。亲爱的毛主席：我们知道您的心和我们的心连在一起，因为我们的心时时的紧跟着您，这些胜利是由于您给的，是属于您的。我们也知道这仅仅是尝试，仅仅是开始。现在我们亲身体会到集体农庄按劳取酬就是走向富裕的道路，我们坚信：明年将更大的超过今年产量，获得重大的丰收。
    致以崇高的敬礼！
