From a Secret "Directive": The U.S. Espionage Policy

Bai Yun

Recently, Indian guard troops intercepted an important secret directive that U.S. spies were attempting to bring into a prisoner-of-war camp. This intercepted "directive" irrefutably proves that the spies in the POW camp were sent in by the U.S., and were directly commanded by high-ranking U.S. lackeys, such as Syngman Rhee and Won Yong-duk, the heads of the spy network. All the spies' activities were carried out according to U.S. plans and instructions. The many facts exposed in the "directive" also provide clues for understanding the entire U.S. espionage policy.

This secret "directive" instructed the spies to "reorganize" the spy organization in the camp, intensify "control" over the prisoners of war, and "must kill those who are willing to return to the North," "fight to the end against explanation," and openly told the spies that they should rely on them to "maintain the decency of democratic countries (referring to the U.S. aggressive bloc)." This is tantamount to the U.S. admitting that it has completely failed in the Korean War, both militarily and morally, and the only way to cover up its failure and "maintain its decency" is to rely on the spies in the eastern camp to complete the U.S. plan to forcibly detain the prisoners of war. In reality, the "decency" that the U.S. wants to "maintain" has long been destroyed with the bankruptcy of the "non-repatriation" myth. The U.S.'s method of "maintaining decency" can only further make people realize the U.S. reactionary group's baseness, viciousness, lowness, and shamelessness.

People see that the U.S. is not only trying to rely on spies to maintain its "decency" in the eastern camp, but also cannot do without spies in its entire foreign and domestic policies. Using spies has become an important way for the U.S. to carry out plunder abroad and oppression at home. Espionage policy has become an important part of U.S. national policy. Vannevar Bush, one of the planners of U.S. national policy, who served as Chairman of the U.S. "National Defense Research Committee" and "Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development," openly advocated the U.S. using spies to carry out so-called "black warfare" in a book called "Modern Arms and Free Men" published in 1950. Bush said: There are many ways of "black warfare," "The first is to expand the methods of the Cold War -- for example, using conspiracy in politics, economics and psychology to create all kinds of harassment within possible enemies, even assassinating or poisoning their leaders or their people, smuggling in pathogens to harm their livestock and crops, or putting debilitating toxins in the tap water, or using other methods to cause internal turmoil in the enemy. All of these belong to this category."

In order to implement this "black warfare," the U.S. Congress has approved hundreds of millions of dollars in special appropriations as funding for international espionage activities. Dulles and his ilk openly announced that they would carry out espionage, sabotage, and provocation activities in other countries. The U.S. "Central Intelligence Agency" and other spy agencies keep more than 100,000 human dregs, distributed around the globe to act as U.S. spies. Even the "Washington Post," a newspaper close to the U.S. State Department, admitted that U.S. spies were doing provocative "dirty work." The newspaper also cited some examples of U.S. espionage activities, such as "funding new Nazi organizations in West Germany," "staging a coup in Guatemala," and "instigating the remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang who were defeated to attack the Chinese mainland from the Burmese border," etc. In recent years, the Soviet Union, our country, and various people's democratic countries have uncovered countless cases of U.S. spies and agents. The vicious conspiracy of U.S. government spies and agents such as Li An-tung, who were uncovered in our country in 1950, to bombard Tiananmen Square, and the unprecedented large-scale provocation event created by U.S. spies in Berlin this June, are the most prominent examples.

In the United States, spies are even more rampant and ubiquitous. The names of U.S. spy agencies are surprisingly numerous, such as the "Federal Bureau of Investigation," the "Subversive Activities Control Board," and the "Loyalty Investigation Committee" of various agencies in the government; the "Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations" of McCarthy in Congress, and the "House Un-American Activities Committee," etc.; and there are also fascist organizations such as the "Veterans of Foreign Wars" and the "Women's Militia Association." They are united with the military police and police to form a nationwide spy network, persecuting the people everywhere, trying to use this method to consolidate the rule of Wall Street. U.S. former presidential candidate Stevenson recently traveled around half the world and returned to admit that "people everywhere" have "recognized American McCarthyism" and recognized the "investigation, cleansing, book burning, oppression, and fear" that fills the United States (United Press International, September 15). American famous journalist Albert Kahn said in his book "The Plot Against the People": "There is no aspect of American life that has not been infiltrated by (FBI Director) Hoover's secret agents. Hoover's detectives, investigators and hired informers are densely distributed in trade unions, political parties, newspapers, universities, private companies, fraternities, local law enforcement agencies, government agencies and the military."

As for U.S. citizens who attempt to resist, in addition to making them unemployed, interrogated, imprisoned, and tortured, the spies ultimately resort to killing them. Torture and assassination go without saying; they even openly adopt the means of killing people as a "show of force," just like the spies in the POW camps in the eastern camp. Kahn's book cited such an example: A spy named Saliu in Charlestown, USA, openly called the local police station in advance and said that he wanted to "teach" a progressive young seaman named Neurob, to "end" Neurob's "red bandit propaganda" and "pro-Negroism." Then, he used a butcher knife to chop Neurob to death in the Seafarers International Union. Afterwards, the murderous spy received "earnest care" from the warden in the prison, and the judge only blamed him for being "unwise in his actions" during the trial. According to this American-style "precedent," the Li-Chiang spies have already committed appalling cases such as the murder of Zhang Zailong and Zhang Liutai, and they have openly clamored in the camp: killing people "is no big deal, just catch a few people and put them in confinement for a few days." And the U.S. "does not know what adjective to use to express respect" to the murderous spies in the secret "directive" of the spy head.

Let people see: this is the "civilization" and "humanitarianism" of the United States, this is the U.S. espionage policy. From a secret "directive" of the U.S. spy head, the beastly faces of the U.S. reactionary group are more clearly revealed.

    从一件秘密“指令”看美国的特务政策
    白云
    最近印度看管部队截获了美方特务企图带入战俘营的一件重要的秘密指令。这件被截获的“指令”铁一样地证明：战俘营中的特务是美方派进去的，是由美国高级走狗李承晚、元容德等特务头子亲自指挥的；特务们的一切活动，都是按照美方的计划和指示进行的。“指令”里所暴露的许多事实，还向人们提供了认识整个的美国特务政策的若干线索。
    这件秘密“指令”要特务们“重新编制”营场中的特务组织，加紧对战俘的“掌握”，并且“必须杀掉愿回北部的家伙”，“为反对解释而斗争到底”，而且对特务们公开地说，要依靠他们来“维持民主国家（指美国侵略集团）的体面。”这等于说，美国自己承认，它在朝鲜战争中，不论军事上和道义上都已彻底失败，唯一掩盖失败和“维持体面”的办法，就全仗东场里的特务们去完成美国强迫扣留战俘的计划。可是，实际上，美国所要“维持”的这种“体面”，早已随着“不愿遣返”神话的破产而完蛋了。美国这种“维持体面”的手段，只能使人们进一步认识美国反动集团的卑鄙、凶恶、下流和无耻。
    人们看到，美国不仅在东场里企图依靠特务来维持它的“体面”，就是在整个对外对内的政策中，都离不开特务。利用特务，已经成了美国对外实行掠夺，对内实行压迫的一个重要方式，特务政策已经成了美国国家政策的一个重要组成部分。美国国家政策的策划者之一，历任美国“国防研究会主席”、“科学研究发展处长”等职的范纳德·布希在一九五○年出版的一本名为“现在武器与自由人”的书中，公开主张美国以特务进行所谓“黑战”。布希说：“黑战”的方式有多种，“第一便是扩大冷战的方式——例如在政治、经济和心理方面用阴谋活动在可能的敌人内部造成种种的骚扰，甚至暗杀或毒害其领袖或其人民，私运入病剂而伤害其牲畜与禾稼，或在自来水中投入使人衰弱的毒剂，或更用其他方法使敌人内部发生动摇，皆属于这一类。”
    为了实行这种“黑战”，美国国会曾经通过成亿元的专门拨款，作为国际特务活动的经费，杜勒斯之流公开宣布要向别的国家进行特务破坏和挑衅活动，美国“中央情报局”等特务机关，豢养着十万名以上的人类渣滓，分布在全球各地充当美国的特务。连接近美国国务院的报纸“华盛顿邮报”也承认，美国特务们干的是挑衅的“肮脏的工作”，该报还举出美国特务活动的一些例子：如“以经费供给西德新的纳粹组织”、“在危地马拉搞政变”、“唆使溃败的蒋介石国民党的残余从缅甸边境进攻中国大陆”等等。几年来，苏联、我国和各人民民主国家，破获了无数的美国特务间谍案件。一九五○年我国破获的美国政府特务间谍李安东等企图炮轰天安门的毒恶阴谋，今年六月美国特务们在柏林制造了空前大规模的挑衅事件，就是最显著的例子。
    在美国国内，特务更是横行霸道，无孔不入。美国特务机构的名目多得惊人，例如政府中有“联邦调查局”、“颠覆活动管制委员会”以及各机关的“忠诚调查委员会”等特务组织，国会中有麦卡锡的“常设调查小组委员会”、众议院的“非美活动调查小组委员会”等特务组织，另外还有“退伍军人团”、“女民兵协会”等法西斯组织。他们与宪兵、警察联成一气，构成了遍布全国的特务网，到处迫害人民，使得人人自危，企图用这种手段，巩固华尔街的统治。美国前总统候选人史蒂文森最近周游半个世界后回去承认说：“到处的人民”都“认识到了美国的麦卡锡主义”，认识到了充满美国的“调查、清洗、焚书、压迫和恐惧”（合众社九月十五日电）。美国名记者阿尔培·康恩在“反人民的阴谋”一书中说：“美国生活没有一方面没有（“联邦调查局”局长）胡佛的密探渗入。在工会、政党、报馆、大学、私营公司、兄弟会、地方执法机关、政府机构和军队里，密布了胡佛的侦探、侦缉员和雇用的告密者。”
      而对于企图反抗的美国公民，特务们除了使他们失业，受讯，监禁和拷打他们而外，最后是采取残杀的办法。酷刑暗杀不用说了；他们甚至和东场里战俘营中的特务一样，公开采取杀人“示众”的手段。康恩的书里举过这样一个例子：美国查尔士登的一个名叫赛利乌的特务，公然先打电话告知当地警察局，说他要“教训”一下一个名叫纽罗勃的进步青年海员，要“结束”纽罗勃的“赤匪宣传”和“亲黑奴主义”。然后，他就用屠刀在海员工会里把纽罗勃砍死了。事后这个杀人的特务在监狱里受到了狱长的“殷切的照顾”，审判时法官只是责备他“行动不智”。根据这种美国式的“先例”，李蒋特务已经干出了杀害张子龙、张六泰等人那样的惨不忍闻的案件，他们还在营场中公开扬言：杀了人“大不了捉几个人去坐几天禁闭”。而美方则在通过特务头子的秘密“指令”中，向杀人的特务“不知道用什么形容词来表示敬意”。
    人们看看吧：这就是美国的“文明”和“人道主义”，这就是美国的特务政策。从美方特务头子的一件秘密“指令”里，就更清楚地照出了美国反动集团的禽兽脸孔。
