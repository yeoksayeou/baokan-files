Farmers along the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway line supported the construction project.

During the construction of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, the farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups along the route enthusiastically supported the project from surveying and design to construction. When the drilling team was conducting geological drilling on the Wushaoling Mountain at an altitude of 3,000 meters above sea level, the cars carrying the machinery could not enter the mountains because they were 20 *li* away from the road. More than 200 Tibetan people near Jile Township immediately drove carts to transport the machinery for the drilling team. A few days later, all the Tibetan people in the township voluntarily organized a team of more than 200 people, who rode horses, drove carts, and brought dry food and tools every day before dawn from 20 to 30 *li* away to build roads for the drilling team. Jia Chaina, a 53-year-old Tibetan woman, said: "During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, 100 *jin* of wool could only be exchanged for three pieces of brick tea. After liberation, 100 *jin* of wool can be exchanged for more than 30 pieces of brick tea. Now Chairman Mao has sent people to build railways for us; in order to make our future life better, we should do this." Therefore, they not only quickly built a 20-*li* mountain road to facilitate the transportation of machines, but also enthusiastically helped the workers load and unload machines, steel pipes, etc., reducing the car's dwell time.

After the fifth detachment of the Survey and Design Team completed the route survey from Wuwei to Yongchang, a local farmer, Lu Yufan, proposed a new and relatively flat route. After research and surveying, it was proved that the route proposed by farmer Lu Yufan was 13 kilometers shorter than the original route, which could save 40 billion yuan in railway construction costs alone. Before another team measured a route, they saw from the map that this section was a desert, and the railway would be difficult to build. However, after visiting the farmers, they found that it was not a desert, but a flat road. After repeated research between them and the local farmers, they finally selected a better route from several comparison lines. Farmers along the Yongdeng section also took the initiative to propose merging canals to the workers. By building two fewer culverts in one work area alone, the state saved more than 80 million yuan.

After the eighth and tenth joint operation engineering teams, tunnel engineering teams, and earthwork engineering teams moved to Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous Region successively, farmers of all ethnic groups, including Tibetan, Mongolian, and Han from Youyi and Yongfeng Townships, held the workers' hands and stroked bulldozers and scrapers like long-lost relatives. At a get-together, Tibetan representative Hua Naolaizhati presented a "hada" to the tenth joint operation engineering team on behalf of farmers of all ethnic groups in the region, and expressed that they would do their best to support the construction of the railway so that the train would arrive in Xinjiang as soon as possible. After construction started, local farmers incorporated their determination and methods to support railway construction into their patriotic pacts. Tibetans often came to the construction site on horseback in groups from dozens of kilometers away. When they saw the railway construction workers, they inquired with concern about the progress of track laying and the living conditions of the workers. When they saw the workers working on the Maya Snow Mountain, which was covered with snow all year round, and lacking fuel for cooking, they transported firewood from the deep mountains dozens of kilometers away to the construction site, and voluntarily reduced the firewood price from 100 yuan per *jin* to 60 yuan. Four or five hundred Tibetans from Huazang and Nanshan Townships in the second district and local farmers voluntarily organized transportation teams to pull coal for the workers at the Tianzhu Coal Mine and chop firewood for the workers in the deep mountains. Tibetans from Youyi Township sent potatoes and radishes to the workers from 30 to 40 *li* away, and Tibetans from Yongfeng Township mobilized more than 20 carts to help the workers transport sand and gravel. In order to have the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway built in Xinjiang as soon as possible, more than 30 Tibetans in the second district participated in the railway construction.

In order to thank the farmers along the route for their help, the railway construction workers often held get-togethers. This year alone, more than 500 farmers of all ethnic groups, including Tibetan, Hui, Mongolian, and Han, participated in the get-together at the Chamiantan construction site. At the get-together, farmers of all ethnic groups performed wonderful songs and dances.

    兰新铁路沿线农民支援筑路工程
    兰新铁路在修筑中，从勘测、设计到施工，都得到了沿线各族农民和牧民的热烈支援。钻探队在拔海三千公尺的乌鞘岭上进行地质钻探时，因离公路二十华里，满载机器的汽车开不进山里去，极乐乡附近二百多藏民知道后，立即赶着大车给钻探队运输机器。过了几天，全乡藏民又自动地组织了一支二百多人的队伍，每天天不亮就骑着马、赶着车、带着干粮和工具，从二、三十里路以外赶来给钻探队修筑公路。五十三岁的藏民老妈妈加柴娜说：“国民党反动统治时，一百斤羊毛只换三块砖茶。解放后，一百斤羊毛可换三十多块砖茶了，现在毛主席又派人来给我们修铁路；为了使今后的日子过得更好，我们应该这样做。”所以他们不但很快地修筑了一条二十华里长的山地公路，使运输机器的汽车往来畅通，而且还热情地帮助工人们装卸机器、钢管等，减少了汽车的停留时间。
    在勘测设计总队第五分队完成了由武威到永昌一段的定线勘测工作后，当地农民陆毓藩又提出一条比较平坦的新线。经过研究勘测，证明农民陆毓藩提出的线路比原来所选的线路缩短十三公里，仅按修建铁路工费计算，就可节省四百亿元。另一个队在测量一条线路前，从地图上看这一个地段是沙漠，铁路很难修通，但访问农民以后，就发现那里并不是沙漠，而是平坦的大道。经过他们和当地农民反覆研究，最后从几条比较线中选了一条较好的线路。永登段沿线农民也主动向工人提出合并水渠的建议，仅在一个工区少修了两座涵管，就替国家节省了八千多万元。
    修路的第八、第十联合作业工程队及隧道工程队、土石方工程队，先后搬到天祝藏族自治区后，友谊、永丰两乡的藏、蒙、汉各族农民，像久别的亲人一样拉着工人的手，抚摸着推土机、铲运机。在一次联欢会上，藏族代表华闹来扎蒂代表全区各族农民，向第十联合作业工程队献“哈达”，并表示一定要用全力支援筑路工程，使火车早日开到新疆。动工以后，当地农民纷纷把支援筑路的决心和办法订入了自己的爱国公约。藏民们时常成群结伙地从几十公里外的地方，骑着马到工地来访问。他们一看到修筑铁路的职工，就关心地探问铺轨的进度和职工们的生活情况。当他们看见工人们在整年披着白雪的马牙雪山上工作，而且缺乏煮饭用的燃料时，就从几十里外的深山中把木柴运到工地来，并主动地把柴价从每斤一百元降低到六十元。二区华藏、南山两乡的四、五百藏民和当地的农民自动组织运输队，到天祝煤矿给工人拉煤，到深山里给工人砍柴。友谊乡的藏民从三、四十里以外的地方给工人送来马铃薯和萝卜，永丰乡的藏民动员了二十多辆大车帮助工人运输砂石。二区农民为了使兰新路早日铺到新疆，有三十多位藏民参加了筑路工作。
    筑路工人为了感激沿线农民的帮助，常举行联欢会。今年仅在岔面滩一个工地参加联欢的藏、回、蒙、汉各族农民就有五百多人。在联欢会上，各族农民都表演了精采的歌唱与舞蹈。
