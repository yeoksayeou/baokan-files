    Lies Cannot Cover Up the Facts
    Li Siguang, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences
    While peace-loving people all over the world are looking forward to the early convocation of a political conference to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, and while the Soviet delegation has put forward an important proposal at the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly on "Measures to Eliminate the Threat of Another World War and Ease International Tensions," the U.S. government has fabricated the slander that the Korean-Chinese side committed "atrocities" against the UN POWs, and pulled together several vassal states to form an absurd proposal, forcibly coercing the UN General Assembly to pass it. This action by the U.S. imperialists clearly aims to conceal the heinous atrocities that it has committed and is still committing.
    Everyone knows that the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement was a severe blow to the bellicose U.S. imperialists, who were extremely unwilling to accept it. It was only under the strong pressure of the Chinese and Korean people and peace-loving people around the world, and because its strength to expand the war was insufficient and internal contradictions were numerous, that it reluctantly accepted the armistice. In order to continue its aggression, continue to control those vassal states, and seize the maximum profits for the Wall Street bosses, it therefore hopes to continue to maintain international tensions. The Korean armistice has brought about some easing of the international situation, which the U.S. is afraid of. In order to continue to maintain the tension of the international situation, it has to resort to manufacturing lies to fulfill its conspiracy. The U.S. representative's creation of shameless lies at the meetings of the negotiating parties of the Korean armistice to engage in delays is the same reason. The U.S. government forced American air force POWs to submit a "sworn statement" to the UN General Assembly, denying the crimes of germ warfare; now it has gathered four vassal states, including Britain, France, Australia, and Turkey, to jointly propose a so-called "atrocities" proposal to slander the Korean and Chinese People's forces, also to create tension.
    The U.S. slandered that the Korean-Chinese side's accusations of germ warfare against it were false, and fabricated the lie that the reason why American air force POWs confessed to germ warfare crimes was because the Korean-Chinese side used "torture." This is clearly lying to the people of the world. Everyone knows that the Korean-Chinese side has always been lenient to POWs. This has been confirmed by the confessions of American air force POWs published at various times, the conversations of repatriated POWs, and reports by some British and American reporters, and even by the talks of U.S. Army Secretary Stevens and the British War Secretary. Under these circumstances, if we still say that those POWs who participated in germ warfare confessed because they were subjected to some threats; then, those threats, it is clear, were not any spiritual or material threats from the Korean-Chinese side's treatment of POWs, but only their own germ warfare crimes threatening their own conscience. Under the influence of the Korean-Chinese side's lenient policy, in the peaceful atmosphere of the POW camp, the American air force POWs recalled their past crimes of spreading germs, and were condemned by their own conscience, so they revealed the facts of their participation in germ warfare. Such feelings are largely revealed in the lines of their confessions, and we can easily perceive them if we look carefully at those confessions.
    The fact that U.S. imperialism carried out large-scale germ warfare in Korea and Northeast China has long been confirmed by impartial investigations by various parties. Because the Chinese and Korean people have organized and vigorously implemented anti-germ warfare measures, launched large-scale patriotic health campaigns, massively eliminated mosquito larvae, and massively eliminated various harmful insects, the evil consequences of germ warfare expected by the U.S. imperialists were shattered. Precisely because the germ warfare was crushed, and the plague did not spread in China and Korea, some of the scientists on the International Scientific Commission were skeptical before the start of the investigation. It was not until they conducted a long-term on-site investigation in Northeast China and Korea, and obtained a large number of facts: including physical specimens of insects and bacteria, and facts about diseases and medicine, and after careful analysis and identification, obtained extremely accurate evidence, that they formally came to an affirmative conclusion about the organized, large-scale, and disguised germ warfare conducted by the United States in Korea. It is conceivable that this is why Dr. Joseph Needham, a biologist and Fellow of the Royal Society of Great Britain who participated in the International Scientific Commission, said in his recent public letter that his belief in the truth of germ warfare "does not depend on what the airmen admit, nor on what they now deny in new and different circumstances." It should be pointed out that the conclusive evidence we now have of U.S. germ warfare far exceeds the evidence obtained by the International Scientific Commission at that time. Therefore, the United States' germ warfare crimes cannot be denied at all.
    The U.S. government's slander of the Korean-Chinese People's forces for so-called "atrocities" against POWs is also unfounded. This despicable trick of the U.S. aggressors shouting "stop thief!" absolutely cannot cover up the eyes and ears of the world. Because the fact that the Korean-Chinese People's forces treated POWs leniently and cared for the people has long been spread all over the world and has been praised by fair-minded people around the world. And the various serious atrocities of the U.S. invading army in Korea of killing, arson, wantonly massacring POWs, and abusing civilians have long been obvious facts, and have been justly condemned by the people of the world. The atrocities of the U.S. invading army in Korea have not only been confirmed by objective investigations by fair-minded organizations such as the International Democratic Women's Federation and the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, but even been admitted by many American and British reporters and U.S. POW camp commanders Dodd and Colson. The U.S. military's inhuman atrocities against our captured personnel include tattooing, beatings, hand cutting, foot chopping, disembowelment, heart digging, steaming to death, boiling to death, and burning alive. Against unarmed POWs, the U.S. military used weapons such as tanks, armored vehicles, flamethrowers, grenades, poison gas, and bayonets to massacre them. The crimes committed by the U.S. invading army in Korea against peaceful residents of Korea are also countless. The "Report of the International Women's Investigation Team on the Atrocities of the U.S. and Syngman Rhee's Army in Korea" alone lists countless bloody facts of the U.S. military, pointing out that the U.S. side "inhumanly eliminated Korean residents. In areas temporarily occupied by the U.S. and Syngman Rhee's troops, hundreds of thousands of peaceful residents, from the elderly to infants, were subjected to torture, burning to death, beating to death, and being buried alive." The report also pointed out: "This large-scale massacre and torture exceeds the crimes committed by the Hitler Nazi bandits when they occupied Europe." These atrocities of the U.S. military have completely violated the Geneva Convention and the Hague Convention of 1907, and constitute the war crimes stipulated in Article 6 of the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal Statute. Now, the U.S. murderers with blood on their hands are trying to confuse the public and escape their deserved punishment by trying to confuse the public, of course, this will only arouse greater anger among the people of the world towards the U.S. aggressors, and will not have any other result.
    The U.S. government's trick of fabricating rumors and slanders is obviously inherited from Goebbels, but Goebbels' lies and propaganda could not help German fascists escape the Nuremberg trials, and the slanders of the Lodges and Mayos cannot save the U.S. imperialists from escaping the embarrassing predicament they are in today.
    The Chinese people are vigilantly watching the conspiracies behind the U.S. imperialists' rumors, and will certainly have the power to crush any of its conspiracies!

    谎言是掩盖不了事实的
    中国科学院副院长　李四光
    当全世界爱好和平的人民正在期待着政治会议早日召开，以和平解决朝鲜问题的时候，当苏联代表团在联合国大会政治委员会上提出“关于消除另一次世界大战的威胁和缓和国际紧张局势的措施”的重要提案的时候，美国政府却捏造了什么朝中方面对“联合国军”战俘施行“暴行”的谰言，并拉出几个仆从国家凑成一个荒谬的提案，硬挟持联合国大会把它通过。美帝国主义者这一行动，很清楚，是妄想掩饰它自己曾经干过而且现在还在干的万恶暴行。
    谁都知道，朝鲜停战协定的签订，对于好战的美国帝国主义者来说，是一个严重的打击，它是极不甘心接受的。只是在中朝人民和全世界爱好和平人民的强大压力之下，并由于它扩大战争的力量不够，内部矛盾甚多，才勉强接受了停战。它为了继续进行侵略，继续控制那些仆从国家，替华尔街老板攫取最大利润，因此又希望继续保持国际紧张局势。朝鲜停战使国际局势有了某些和缓，这是美国所害怕的。它为了继续保持国际局势的紧张，不得不用制造谎言来遂其阴谋。美国代表在朝鲜停战缔约双方会谈的会议上，制造一些无耻的谎言来从事拖延，就是这个道理。美国政府逼迫美国空军战俘向联合国大会提出什么“宣誓书”，抵赖细菌战罪行；现在纠集英国、法国、澳大利亚、土耳其等四个仆从国家联合提出所谓“暴行”的提案，对朝中人民部队进行诬蔑，也是为了制造紧张局势。
    美国诬蔑朝中方面对于它所进行的细菌战的指责是假的，并捏造美国空军战俘之所以供出细菌战罪行是由于朝中方面使用“酷刑”的谎言。这显然是当着全世界人民的面扯谎。谁都知道，朝中方面对战俘素来是宽大的。从历次发表的美国空军战俘的供词和已遣返的战俘们的谈话，以及一些英、美记者的报道，甚至美国陆军部长斯蒂文斯、英国陆军大臣的谈话，都证实了这一点。在这种情况下，如果还要说那些参加过细菌战的战俘招供，是受到过什么威胁；那末，那些威胁，很清楚，不是朝中方面的对待战俘的任何精神上或物质上的威胁，而只是他们自己进行细菌战的罪行威胁着他们自己的良心。美国空军战俘们在朝中方面宽待政策的感召之下，在战俘营安静和平的气氛之中，回想起他们过去撒布细菌的罪行，而受到自己良心的谴责，所以他们才将参加细菌战的经过事实揭露出来。这样的心情，大量地流露在他们供词的字里行间，只要我们仔细看看那些供词，我们是很容易察觉的。
    美帝国主义在朝鲜和中国东北大规模进行细菌战的事实，是早经各方面的公正调查所确定了的。由于中朝两国人民有组织地大力地进行了反细菌战的措施，开展了大规模的爱国卫生运动，大量地清除了虫窠孑孓，大量地消灭了各种有害昆虫，美帝国主义者所预期的细菌战恶果才被粉碎了。正由于细菌战被粉碎，瘟疫并没有能在中朝境内流行，所以当国际科学委员会的科学家们，在开始调查前，并不是没有人抱着怀疑态度的。直到他们到中国东北和朝鲜进行了长期的实地调查，获得了大批的事实：包括昆虫、细菌等实物标本和疾病、医学等方面的事实，经过缜密的分析、鉴定，得出了万分正确的证据，这才对美国在朝鲜有组织的、大规模的、在伪装之下进行的细菌战正式作了肯定的结论。很可想见，正因如此，所以曾参加国际科学委员会的英国皇家学会会员生物学家李约瑟博士，才在他最近发表的公开信中说到他自己之所以相信细菌战的真实性，“绝不决定于飞行人员所承认的，也不决定于他们现在在新的、不同的环境下所否认的”。应该指出，我们现在所掌握的美国进行细菌战的确凿证据，是远远超过当时国际科学委员会所获得的证据的。因此，美国的细菌战罪行是绝对抵赖不了的。
    美国政府诬蔑朝中人民部队对战俘施行的所谓“暴行”，也是毫无根据的。美国侵略者这种贼喊捉贼的卑劣手法，绝对不能掩盖天下人的耳目。因为朝中人民部队宽待战俘和爱护人民的事实，早已传遍天下，得到世界公正人士的交口赞扬。而美国侵略军在朝鲜杀人放火，恣意屠杀战俘和虐杀平民的种种严重暴行，早已是有目共见的事实，并已受到世界人民的正义声讨。美国侵略军在朝鲜的暴行，不但已为国际民主妇女联合会和国际民主法律工作者协会等公正团体的客观调查所证实，甚至为许多美英记者及美国战俘营长官杜德和柯尔生所供认。美军对我方被俘人员所施行的惨绝人寰的暴行，包括刺字、毒打、割手、剁足、剖腹、挖心、蒸死、煮死、活活烧死等骇人听闻的虐杀方法。对于手无寸铁的战俘，美军竟使用坦克、装甲车、喷火弹、手榴弹、毒气、刺刀等武器加以屠杀。侵朝美军对朝鲜和平居民所犯的罪行，也是不胜枚举的。单是“国际妇女对朝鲜美李军暴行调查团报告书”就列举了美军的无数血腥事实，指出美方“惨无人道地消灭朝鲜居民。在暂时遭到美军和李承晚军队侵占的地区，有数十万的和平居民，全家从老人到婴孩都遭受到拷打、烧死、打死、活埋。”报告书并指出：“这种大规模的屠杀和拷打，超过了希特勒纳粹匪徒占领欧洲时所犯的罪行。”美军这些暴行，已经彻底破坏了日内瓦公约和一九○七年的海牙公约，并构成了纽伦堡国际军事法庭法规第六条所规定的战争罪行。现在，双手染满了鲜血的美国杀人犯，竟含血喷人，企图混淆视听，以逃脱它的应得惩罚，当然，这除了激起世界人民对美国侵略者的更大的愤怒外，是不会有任何其他结果的。
    美国政府造谣诬蔑的伎俩，显然是戈培尔一脉相传的，但戈培尔的谎言宣传不能帮助德国法西斯逃避纽伦堡的审判，洛奇、梅奥之流的诽谤也不能挽救美国帝国主义者逃避今天所处的狼狈不堪的窘境。
    中国人民正警惕地注视着美帝国主义者谣言后面的阴谋，并且一定有力量粉碎它的任何阴谋！
