    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 11th -- The hope for the resumption of explanation work by the Korean-Chinese side has been shattered again due to special agents from the American side opposing isolation. The explanation work, which has been interrupted for twenty-five days, remains at a standstill. On the 10th, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission announced that the facilities for isolating already-explained and un-explained prisoners of war in Dongchang-ri were ready. Based on this, the Korean-Chinese side proposed today a plan to conduct explanations for 250 prisoners of war in Camp No. 53 tomorrow. However, the notification received from the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission this afternoon stated that special agents in Camp No. 53 refused to implement isolation and would not allow prisoners of war to come out and listen to explanations. Therefore, the explanation work cannot be resumed tomorrow.
    The isolation issue was the reason for the fifth interruption of the explanation work by the Korean-Chinese side twenty-five days ago. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission promised on November 6th to build an isolation camp, and this arrangement was completed yesterday. However, even this delayed measure cannot enable the resumption of explanations due to the sabotage of American special agents.
    The Korean-Chinese side has made continuous efforts to resume the explanation work, but still cannot break the deadlock. At the same time, the Korean-Chinese side is giving the American side all the necessary conveniences for explanation work (such as building an isolation camp), so that the explanations in Songgok-ri can proceed as planned. This is an extremely unreasonable and unequal situation.
    According to recently returned captured personnel from the Korean-Chinese side, American special agents in the camps have received new instructions and are actively preparing to force prisoners of war to "escape collectively" in order to completely destroy the "Terms of Reference" and "Rules of Procedure".

### 中立国遣返委员会在东场里修好一个隔离营场  我方解释工作因特务反对隔离仍无法恢复

    中立国遣返委员会在东场里修好一个隔离营场
    我方解释工作因特务反对隔离仍无法恢复
    【新华社开城十一日电】朝中方面解释工作恢复的希望，又因美方特务反对隔离而破灭，业已中断二十五天的解释工作继续陷于停顿。十日中立国遣返委员会通知说，在东场里对已经解释和未经解释的战俘实行隔离的设备已经准备好，朝中方面据此于今天提出明天向第五十三号营场的二百五十名战俘进行解释的计划，但今天下午接到的中立国遣返委员会的通知说，第五十三号营场的特务拒绝实行隔离，不允许战俘出来听解释，因此明天不能恢复解释工作。
    隔离问题是朝中方面解释工作在二十五天以前第五次中断的原因，中立国遣返委员会曾在十一月六日答应修建一个隔离营场，到昨天完成了这一安排。但是，即使这种被迟延了的措施，也因美方特务的破坏不能使解释恢复。
    朝中方面为恢复解释工作曾作了不断的努力，但仍不能打破停顿的僵局。但同时朝中方面却给予美方解释工作以一切便利条件（例如修建隔离营场），使松谷里的解释得以按计划进行，这是极不合理、不对等的情况。
    据最近归来的朝中被俘人员揭露，美方在营场中的特务已经得到新的指示，正积极准备强迫战俘
  “集体逃跑”，以彻底破坏“职权范围”与“工作细则”。
