Currently, it is the peak season for farmers to sell surplus grain and other cash crops, and the time for spring plowing and production is approaching. Supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels should closely coordinate with the purchase of agricultural products and do a good job in supplying materials, especially the supply of means of production. This is related to whether the state's grain purchase work can be carried out smoothly and is a major issue related to helping farmers expand production.

Due to the long-term devastation and destruction by Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bandit gangs, farmers' means of production suffered serious losses in the past. By 1949, the number of draught animals nationwide had decreased by 16 percent, and the number of major agricultural implements had decreased by 30 percent. In the years since liberation, under the leadership of the People's Government, tremendous restoration work has been carried out. Taking fertilizer supply as an example, in 1951, cooperatives and the China Native Produce Company supplied farmers with 1,131,400 tons of fertilizer. In 1952, the cooperative system supplied farmers with 2.9 million tons. In 1953, it is estimated that 4 million tons will be supplied. The supply of other means of production has also increased. This is an important guarantee for the gradual increase in agricultural production in recent years.

However, it must also be recognized that the current supply of means of production is still far from meeting the requirements of China's agricultural development. For example, in the 38 villages within the scope of the Xixiagezhuang primary cooperative in Laiyang, Shandong Province, more than 4,800 agricultural implements need to be added within half a year, but the cooperative only supplied 204 pieces. The Zhouxiang Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Yuyao County, Zhejiang, which has relatively good business operations among the county's cooperatives, only manages 15 kinds of agricultural implements, such as hoes, scrapers, bamboo mats, earth baskets, and tool handles, accounting for only 37 percent of the agricultural implements commonly used by local farmers. Similar situations also exist in other regions. Due to the insufficient supply of means of production, it has aroused dissatisfaction among cooperative members. Some members criticized the cooperative, saying: "The cooperative wants more share capital, but we want production tools. The cooperative doesn't care about our production!" These criticisms from farmers are correct.

The reason why the supply of means of production is not well done, apart from insufficient production, is also due to the fact that some supply and marketing cooperative cadres have not yet deeply realized the important significance of supply and marketing cooperatives serving agricultural production. We know that improving agricultural implements and improving agricultural technology are important conditions for increasing agricultural production. Now that the recovery period of China's agriculture has passed, and the mutual aid and cooperation movement is developing vigorously, this has put forward new requirements for rural supply and marketing work, that is, to do our best to supply the means of production necessary for developing agriculture, and we must never be satisfied with the supply of general consumer goods. When the Soviet economy moved from the recovery stage to the development stage, Stalin pointed out: "If we used to mainly satisfy the personal needs of farmers and were less involved in the production needs of the farmer's economy, then now, in addition to continuing to satisfy the personal needs of farmers, we must also do our best to provide them with those items that are directly related to using new technologies to transform agricultural production." ("On the Right Deviation in the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)") The spirit of this instruction is very applicable to us today. Supply and marketing cooperative cadres should recognize the major relationship between supplying the means of production needed by farmers and developing agricultural production and gradually carrying out the socialist transformation of agriculture.

Actively doing a good job in supplying means of production has a great supporting effect on the state's purchase of grain, cotton, and other agricultural products. Because China's small-scale peasant economy has the characteristics of buying and selling for the sake of buying, many farmers sell agricultural products in order to continue to expand reproduction and ensure the supply of their necessary consumer goods. Past experience in purchasing grain and cotton has proven this, and this year's experience in purchasing grain and cotton has further proven this. For example, Shanxi Province had a bumper harvest this year, but there were many difficulties in purchasing grain at the beginning. On October 25, the Hongtong County Supply and Marketing Cooperative purchased 71 head of livestock and sold 37 head to farmers by the 29th, immediately purchasing 102,300 jin of wheat. This shows that as long as the supply and marketing cooperative effectively investigates the needs of farmers and satisfies the means of production and consumer goods that farmers need as much as possible, especially the needs of means of production, it can encourage farmers to sell more surplus grain and can help farmers specifically solve the difficulties in developing production and increasing grain production, and encourage farmers' enthusiasm for active production.

In order to do a good job in supplying means of production, we must first overcome the capitalist business ideology and bureaucratic work style in the leadership of supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels. This is the business ideology of only looking at the size of profits and not taking care of the needs of farmers, and not actively supporting agricultural production. For example, during the summer harvest and summer planting season in Guangdong Province this year, farmers urgently needed a large number of agricultural implements, but the Huiyang County Cooperative disliked the small profits from operating agricultural implements and did not organize supply, so that farmers had to take a boat to Aotou, ninety miles away, to buy a sickle, wasting busy farming time and affecting production. Ren Gui, the director of the Bianlin Village Office of the Kaitong County Cooperative in Heilongjiang Province, sold 600 shovels originally ordered by farmers in the seventh district for 10,050 yuan per piece to Tieli County for 12,000 yuan per piece in order to simply pursue profits. Some cooperatives also only supply products that sell well in the market and are easy to make money, and are unwilling to supply those means of production that make less money, are inconvenient to transport, or are troublesome in a piecemeal way, but are closely related to agricultural production; even in the management of means of production, there is a phenomenon of demanding excessively high profits. This kind of blindness in business, fear of trouble, and purely profit-seeking capitalist ideology are all divorced from the cooperative's business policy, violate the basic tasks of the cooperative, and also hinder the normal development of the cooperative's business. Supply and marketing cooperative cadres should actively overcome this bad tendency in business, clearly implement the business policy of serving agricultural production, and actively serve the supply of farmers' means of production and agricultural production.

The central link in strengthening the organization of the supply of means of production is to organize the source of goods. The most important thing at present is to organize local sources of handicrafts. Because among the means of production and livelihood needed by the vast number of farmers in our country today, handicrafts account for about 60 or 70 percent, or even about 80 percent. If supply and marketing cooperatives ignore the organization of local handicrafts and seek far and wide, and attempt to purchase all commodities from other places, it will not only increase freight and increase product costs, but also will inevitably be difficult to sell and cause backlogs due to product specifications and quality not meeting local habits, which is extremely detrimental to agricultural production and the operation and management of cooperatives. In order to organize the source of handicrafts, cooperatives at all levels should establish close ties with local craftsmen, and conduct planned processing and ordering based on the production and sales of local handicrafts and the requirements of farmers for the quantity, specifications, and quality of handicrafts, but should prevent the practice of "taking on everything" or "guaranteeing supply and sales for everything." Some places have adopted the method of holding small-scale material exchange fairs when organizing the source of goods, exchanging production and sales information, and adjusting what is available; some places hold forums for craftsmen and old farmers to communicate the opinions of producers and consumers, stipulate product varieties, specifications, and quantities, and then organize the source of goods in a planned and purposeful manner. These methods are relatively successful and can be appropriately promoted in various places according to specific circumstances.

In addition to the supply of agricultural implements, we must also pay great attention to the operation of fertilizers. Due to the year-by-year increase in farmers' demand for fertilizers, and the production of commercial fertilizers is currently not much, there is still a phenomenon of supply falling short of demand. In order to appropriately solve the current fertilizer problem, party committees and governments, agricultural departments at all levels, and supply and marketing cooperatives in various places must first conscientiously implement the policy of "farmyard manure as the mainstay and commercial fertilizer as a supplement," mobilize farmers to accumulate more natural fertilizers (such as compost, green manure, stable manure, ash manure, etc.), and chemical fertilizers should be used in a controlled and focused manner, and it is not appropriate to promote them on a large scale for the time being.

In order to do a good job in the supply of means of production, cooperatives should also actively improve business management, strive to reduce commodity circulation links, reduce circulation costs, and reduce costs, which is beneficial to producers, transporters, and consumers. To this end, the basic principles for supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels to organize local sources of handicrafts are: where local handicraft producers and consumers can directly meet and exchange goods using local markets, primary cooperatives do not need to intervene in the operation, but must supervise craftsmen to prevent them from making shoddy goods or raising prices, in order to take care of the interests of consumers; where handicraft producers need to directly meet and exchange goods with primary cooperatives or their retail units, higher-level cooperatives (county and special district cooperatives) should actively encourage and help, lead and organize them, and do not need to intervene in the operation; where producers must go through higher-level cooperative wholesale units for exchange, lower-level cooperatives should be organized to directly order goods from producers as much as possible according to needs and possible conditions; however, it is necessary to actively operate where higher-level cooperatives need to uniformly process orders and appropriately reserve goods. Only by adopting these principles can cooperatives avoid dispersing their forces, can promote appropriate division of labor between upper and lower-level cooperatives, so as to concentrate forces and organize those handicrafts that must be adjusted by cooperatives; on the other hand, it can reduce circulation links, reduce costs, and reduce the burden on consumers, thereby allowing consumers to purchase more handicrafts, which is extremely beneficial to both handicraft producers and farmers. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various places should implement these principles.

The supply and marketing cooperative organization, which has 32,000 primary cooperatives and more than 100 million members, has become an important component of China's national economic life. The supply and marketing cooperative organization has played and will continue to play a huge role in closely linking cities and villages, industry and agriculture, and workers and farmers. Supply and marketing cooperatives actively do a good job in supply and marketing, which can promote the development of agricultural production, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, and thereby play its role in realizing the socialist transformation of agriculture in terms of supply and marketing. Therefore, supply and marketing cooperative cadres should recognize the importance of the responsibilities they bear, actively organize the commodity exchange of industrial and agricultural products, carry out the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, and strive to complete the supply and marketing tasks given by the state and cooperative members.

### 供销合作社应大力做好生产资料供应工作

    供销合作社应大力做好生产资料供应工作
    目前正是农民卖出余粮和其他经济作物的旺季，离春耕生产时间又很近，各级供销合作社应密切配合农产品的收购，做好物资供应工作，特别是做好生产资料的供应工作。这是关系到国家收购粮食工作能否顺利进行的问题，关系到帮助农民扩大生产的重大问题。
    由于我国过去长期受到日寇及国民党匪帮的摧残破坏，农民生产资料遭受严重的损失。到一九四九年，全国耕畜减少了百分之十六，主要农具减少了百分之三十。解放几年来，在人民政府的领导下，进行了巨大的恢复工作。以肥料供应来说，一九五一年由合作社和中国土产公司供应农民的肥料为一百一十三万一千四百吨，一九五二年由合作社系统供应农民二百九十万吨，一九五三年预计供应四百万吨。其他生产资料供应也都有增加。这是几年来农业生产逐步上升的重要保证。
    但是也必须看到，目前生产资料的供应与我国农业生产发展的要求还很不相适应。譬如：山东省莱阳西夏格庄基层社范围内的三十八个村，半年内须添农具四千八百多件，而该社只供应了二百零四件。浙江余姚全县合作社中业务经营比较好的周巷供销合作社，经营农具只有锄头、刮子、竹簟、土箕、农具柄等十五种，仅占当地农民习惯使用农具的百分之三十七。其它地区也有类似的情况。由于生产资料供应不足，就引起了社员群众的不满，有的社员批评合作社说：“合作社要的是增股金，我们要的是生产工具，合作社不关心我们生产！”农民这些批评是正确的。
    生产资料供应工作作得不好的原因，除了生产不足而外，更由于某些供销合作社干部还没有深刻地认识到供销合作社应为农业生产服务的重要意义。我们知道，改良农具，提高农业技术，是增加农业生产的重要条件之一。现在，我国农业的恢复时期已经过去了，而互助合作运动正蓬勃发展起来，这就对农村供销工作提出了新的要求，就是要尽力供应发展农业所必需的生产资料，绝不能满足于一般生活资料的供应了。斯大林在苏联经济由恢复阶段走向发展阶段时曾指出：“如果说我们从前主要是满足农民底个人需要，而少牵涉到农民经济底生产需要，那末现在我们除继续满足农民底个人需要外，同时还须尽力供给他们那些与用新技术改造农业生产有直接关系的物品”。（“论联共（布）党内的右倾”）这个指示的精神对我们今天是很适用的，供销合作社干部应该认识供应农民所需的生产资料，跟发展农业生产和对农业逐步进行社会主义改造的重大关系。
    积极做好生产资料供应工作对国家收购粮食、棉花和其他农产品有很大的支持作用。因为我国小农经济有着为买而卖的购销特点，很多农民是为了继续扩大再生产和保证其必需的消费资料的供应而卖出农产品的。过去收购粮棉的经验已证明了这一点，今年收购粮棉的经验更证明了这一点。例如山西省今年丰收，但购粮工作最初有很多困难。洪洞县供销合作社在十月二十五日购回牲口七十一头，至二十九日卖给农民三十七头，立即购到小麦十万二千三百斤。这就可以看出：供销合作社只要切实地调查了农民的需要，尽可能地满足农民所需要的生产资料和生活资料，特别是生产资料的需要，就可以鼓舞农民多卖余粮，并可帮助农民具体地解决发展生产、增产粮食中的困难，鼓励农民积极生产的情绪。
    为了做好生产资料供应工作，首先必须克服供销合作社各级领导上的资本主义经营思想和官僚主义作风。这就是只看利润大小，而不照顾农民的需要，不积极扶助农业生产的经营思想。例如广东省今年夏收夏种季节，农民迫切需要大量农具，惠阳县合作社却嫌经营农具利润小，不组织供应，以致农民为了买一把镰刀要搭船到九十里外的澳头去买，浪费农忙时间，影响了生产。黑龙江省开通县社驻边临村办事处主任任贵，为了单纯追求利润，把七区农民原以每张一万零五十元订购好的六百张鐥刀以每张一万二千元卖给了铁骊县。还有的合作社在经营业务时，只供应市场畅销的和容易赚钱的产品，而不肯供应那些赚钱较少、搬运不便、或零星麻烦、但和农业生产有密切关系的生产资料；即使在经营生产资料中也有要求利润过高的现象。这种经营中的盲目性，怕麻烦和单纯追求利润的资本主义思想，都是脱离合作社的经营方针，违反合作社的基本任务，并且也妨碍合作社业务的正常发展的。供销合作社干部应积极克服经营中的这种不良倾向，明确贯彻为农业生产服务的经营方针，积极为供应农民生产资料、为农业生产服务。
    加强组织生产资料供应工作的中心环节是组织货源。当前最首要的是要组织手工业地方货源。因为我国广大农民今天需要的生产和生活资料中，其中手工业产品约占百分之六十、七十，甚至达到百分之八十左右。如果供销合作社忽视组织当地手工业产品，而舍近求远，一切商品都企图从外地采购，那不仅将会增加运费，加大产品成本、且将由于产品规格，质量不合当地习惯，势必难以推销而造成积压，这对农业生产和对合作社的经营管理都是极为不利的。为了组织手工业货源，各级合作社应和当地手工业者建立密切的联系，根据当地手工业的产销情况和农民对手工业产品的数量、规格和品质的要求，进行有计划地加工订货，但应防止“大包大揽”或“一切都包供包销”的做法。有些地方在组织货源时，采取了召开小型物资交流会的办法，互通产销情况，调剂有无；有些地方召开手工业者和老农座谈会，沟通生产者和消费者的意见，规定产品品种，规格及数量，然后有计划地，有目的地组织货源。这些办法都是比较成功的，各地可根据具体情况，适当加以推广。
    除了农具供应而外，还必须十分重视肥料的经营。由于农民对肥料需要量的逐年增加，而商品肥料的生产目前还不多，因此还有供不应求的现象，为了适当解决当前的肥料问题。各级党政、农业部门和各地供销合作社均须首先认真贯彻“农家肥料为主、商品肥料为辅”的方针，动员农民多积自然肥料（如堆肥、绿肥、厩肥、灰粪等），而对化学肥料，则应采取有控制地、有重点地加以调剂使用，暂不宜再行大量推广。
    为了作好生产资料的供应，合作社还应该积极改善经营管理，力求减少商品流转环节，降低流转费用，降低成本，这对产、运、消三者都是有利的。为此，各级供销合作社组织手工业地方货源的基本原则是：凡当地手工业生产者与消费者，能利用当地集市直接见面和交流的，基层合作社可不必插手经营，但必须监督手工业者，防止其粗制滥造或提高价格，以照顾消费者的利益；凡手工业生产者须与基层合作社或其零售单位直接见面和交流者，上级社（县、专区社）应积极鼓励和帮助，加以领导和组织，也不必插手经营；凡生产者必须经过上级社批发单位交流者，应根据需要和可能的条件，尽量组织下级社与生产者直接订货；但是凡需要上级社统一加工订货和适当储备者，则必须积极经营。只有采取了这些原则，一方面合作社才能不致分散力量，才能促使上下级社适当分工，以便于集中力量，组织那些必须由合作社进行调剂的手工业产品；另一方面又可减少流转环节，降低成本，减少消费者的负担，从而使消费者更多地购买手工业产品，这对于手工业生产者和农民都是极为有利的。各地供销合作社应该贯彻执行这些原则。
    拥有三万二千个基层社和一亿以上社员的供销合作社组织，已成为我国国民经济生活中一个重要组成部分。供销合作组织对密切城市与乡村、工业与农业、工人与农民之间的联系已经起着并将继续起着巨大的作用。供销合作社积极做好供销工作，就能促进农业生产的发展，工农联盟的巩固，并从而发挥它在供销方面对农业实现社会主义改造的作用。所以，供销合作社干部应认识到自己担负责任的重大，积极地组织工农业产品的商品交换，开展城乡物资交流，为完成国家和社员群众所给予的供销任务而努力。
