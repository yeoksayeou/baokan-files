Pang Jinhai Mutual Aid Team Sells 140,000 Jin of Grain at Once

The farmers of the Pang Jinhai Mutual Aid Team in Shisihuali Village, Thirteenth District, Shangzhi County, Songjiang Province, have recognized that only with the development of national industry can agricultural production and farmers' lives be further improved. They also learned the lesson from last year when some farmers hoarded grain hoping for better prices but ended up losing grain. The entire team sold 140,000 jin of grain to the state at once. The farmers in this mutual aid team believe that selling grain early is better than selling it late, and selling it in bulk is better than selling it piecemeal, both for the country and for themselves. For example, team member Yang Jiwen sold 2,200 jin of grain in four installments last year, and the money he earned was not used for anything worthwhile and was spent as soon as he got it. He said at a recent meeting of the mutual aid team members: "Why did I sell it piecemeal last year? Mainly because I thought the price of grain might rise later, but it didn't, and the grain actually lost weight, and I didn't save any money. This year, I want to sell all my surplus grain to the state at once and buy a horse." In addition to the 140,000 jin of grain that this mutual aid team has already sold to the state, they are also preparing to sell another 100,000 jin of surplus grain to the state.

People's Representatives Take the Lead in Selling Grain

Chen Fengming, Li Jiang, and five other people's representatives from the Third District of Zhanyu County, Heilongjiang Province, attended the county people's representative meeting on November 11. After listening to the report on the general line and general task of the state during the transition period, they firmly stated that they would advance along the socialist road, do a good job in mutual aid and cooperation, and sell more grain to the state. Li Jiang said: "Listening to the Communist Party is never wrong. If we hadn't organized production according to the Communist Party's instructions these past few years, would we be so prosperous? In the future, when the country's industry develops, we will be able to use tractors to farm, and our lives will be even better." They are determined to take practical actions to motivate the peasant masses to sell grain. The seven of them plan to sell 165 shi of grain to the state and use the money from the sale to buy five horses, four carts, and ten cows.

Wang Xing Mobilizes Cooperative Members to Sell Wheat

Wang Xing, the director of the Henggu Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Third District of Fengnan County, Hebei Province, is a skilled leader in the local mutual aid and cooperation movement, and everyone in the township praises him. Their agricultural production cooperative harvested more than 11,000 jin of wheat this year, and after exchanging some for coarse grains, they still have more than 5,000 jin left.

In late October, Wang Xing held a forum with the cooperative members, explaining that the country is carrying out economic construction and needs a lot of grain, and that farmers should sell grain to the state to help the country's construction. He also said: "The new-style seven-inch walking plow we are using now is manufactured by factories. When the country's industry develops, the worker elder brothers will be able to produce more machines for us to help us harvest more grain." The cooperative members felt that what he said was very reasonable and expressed that they should sell their surplus grain to the state. After the meeting, they quickly sold 4,500 jin of wheat to the supply and marketing cooperative. (Wei Jianhua, Cui Bingrang)

Guo Fengcai Finds Ways to Save and Sell More Grain

Guo Fengcai is the township chairman of Qingcheng Township in the Datong Lake District of Nanzhou County, Hunan. The fields his family cultivated were very low-lying. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, they had "nine years of crop failure out of ten"; after liberation, the People's Government helped to build water conservancy projects, resulting in bumper harvests year after year. This year, they harvested more than 200 shi of grain, after paying the agricultural tax.

On November 12, Guo Fengcai attended the county enlarged cadre meeting, studied the general line of the state during the transition period, understood the direction of his efforts, and understood the significance of the state's purchase of grain. He plans to not only sell the existing surplus grain but also find ways to save grain to sell to the state. He made a preliminary plan to eat taro mixed with rice from eight fen of land and use miscellaneous grains to feed livestock, which could save thousands of jin of grain. He said excitedly: "Including the surplus grain and the grain saved, I can sell at least 15,000 jin to the state. The money from selling the grain can be deposited in the bank, which the state can use for construction, and I can also earn interest. Next spring, I can take it out to buy fertilizer and expand production so I can harvest more grain!" (Yan Yangchun, Gui Gu, Xia Dinggao)

    为了祖国建设，把粮食卖给国家
    庞金海互助组一次卖粮十四万斤
    松江省尚志县第十三区十四里村庞金海互助组的农民，认清了国家工业发展了，农业生产和农民生活才能更加提高的道理，并且接受了去年有的农民等价惜售结果损失了粮食的教训，全组组员一次就卖给国家十四万斤粮食。这个互助组的农民都认为，不论对国家或对自己，早卖粮比晚卖粮好，整卖粮比零卖粮好。像组员杨继文去年把两千二百斤粮食卖了四次，卖的钱一点也没得正用，到手随着就花了。他在最近开的一次互助组组员会议上说：“去年我为啥零卖了呢？主要是我想粮食以后能涨价，结果没有涨价，反而粮食掉了秤，钱也没攒下。今年我要把余粮一次卖给国家，买一匹马。”这个互助组除了已卖给国家的十四万斤粮食外，还准备再卖十万斤余粮给国家。
    人民代表带头卖粮
    黑龙江省瞻榆县第三区人民代表陈凤鸣、李江等七人，在十一月十一日参加县人民代表会议，听了关于国家过渡时期总路线和总任务的报告以后，坚决表示要沿着社会主义的道路前进，搞好互助合作，多把粮食卖给国家。李江说：“听共产党的话没错，这几年，要不是听共产党的话组织起来生产，能这样富裕吗？将来国家工业发展了，咱们能使拖拉机种地，生活就能过得更好。”他们决心以实际行动来带动农民群众卖粮，七人计划卖给国家一百六十五石粮食，用卖粮得到的钱买五匹马、四辆大车和十头牛。
    王兴动员社员卖小麦
    河北省丰南县第三区横古乡农业生产合作社主任王兴，是当地领导互助合作运动的能手，乡里人人都夸奖他。他们这个农业生产合作社，今年收了一万一千多斤小麦，除掉换了粗粮的，还剩下五千多斤。
    十月下旬，王兴和社员们开了一个座谈会，向大家说明国家正在进行经济建设，需要很多粮食，农民应该把粮食卖给国家，帮助国家建设。他并且说：“咱们现在使用的新式七吋步犁，就是工厂制造的。国家的工业发展了，工人老大哥就能给我们生产更多的机器，帮我们多打粮食。”社员们听他讲的道理很对，纷纷发言表示应该把余粮卖给国家。开过会后，他们很快就把四千五百斤麦子卖给了供销合作社。    （魏建华  崔秉让）
    郭凤才设法节约多卖粮
    郭凤才是湖南南县大通湖区庆成乡的乡主席。他家种的田都很低洼，在国民党反动统治时代是“十年九不收”；解放后，人民政府帮助兴修水利，连年丰收。他们今年打的粮食，除了交公粮还剩二百多石谷。
    十一月十二日，郭凤才参加了县扩大干部会议，学习了国家过渡时期的总路线，明白了努力的方向，了解了国家收购粮食的意义。他打算除了卖出现有的余粮，还要设法节省出粮食卖给国家。他初步计划了一下，把八分田的芋头拌饭吃，改用杂粮喂家畜，就可以节省几千斤粮食。他兴奋地说：“连余粮和节省出来的粮食，至少可以卖给国家一万五千斤。卖粮的钱，存在银行里，国家可以用来搞建设，我也可以得利息。明年春上取出来买肥料，扩大生产，就可以多打些粮食！”    （严阳春  贵谷  夏鼎高）
