    Two Agricultural Production Cooperatives in Gaokan Village, Shenyang
    Ship 300,000 Jin of Surplus Grain to the State
    The one hundred and fifteen peasant households of the Gaokan and Xinglong Agricultural Production Cooperatives in Gaokan Village, eastern suburb of Shenyang, decided to sell all 300,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. The Xinglong Agricultural Production Cooperative (referred to as Xinglong Cooperative) began sending grain to the designated grain company as early as November 21st. By the 25th, it had already sent 30,000 jin of grain, all of which was the best "Yellow Mazi" good corn that had been dried the most.
    Both cooperatives adopted the method of collective grain sales, selling the surplus grain collectively to the state after threshing, without distributing it to the members' homes. The grain sold was allocated according to the amount each household was entitled to. This method was first proposed by the members of the Xinglong Cooperative and was immediately adopted by the Gaokan Cooperative after being approved by the members' congress. This saved at least four threshing procedures compared to distributing it and then concentrating the grain for delivery, eliminating losses during the threshing process.
    After receiving education on the general line of the state during the transition period, the members of the Xinglong Cooperative not only immediately decided to sell their surplus grain to the state, but also actively carried out transportation work. Guan Hailin, an old carter, did not return home until 11 p.m. on the first day of grain delivery, but he immediately repaired the rope sets without resting. The next day, at four o'clock in the morning, he called up the other four carters to load the carts. When the Youth League members Lin Shubai and Lin Chenghou learned about this, they got up early and ran to help load the carts. More than twenty people came at once and quickly loaded the carts, delivering the grain early. Jing Zhaokui, an old man feeding horses, voluntarily cooked meals for the grain deliverers in the cooperative. Zhao Deyou felt that some of the corn was a bit dusty, so he voluntarily fanned it to blow the dust away - all of these were voluntary work that they did on their own initiative, neither a division of labor within the cooperative nor did anyone mention earning work points.
    Zhao Hengyu, a member of the Gaokan Cooperative, received a total of 3,000 jin of grain and decided to sell 2,000 jin to the state. Previously, he worried about where to put the money after selling it. Later, he learned that it could be deposited in the credit department of the supply and marketing cooperative. He said, "This is better than anything else, just like blood flowing through the body, not forming dead knots." Zhang Zhenfa, the director of the cooperative, said, "Grain prices are rising year by year. The average price of corn, sorghum, and soybeans has increased by 37 percent compared to 1949, but white cloth has decreased by 22 percent compared to 1949. A Hongqi brand rubber tire cost 3.7 million yuan in 1951, but this year it can be bought for 2.97 million yuan. These are all the benefits that the Communist Party has brought to the peasants. Of course, the members are willing to sell grain to the state to support national construction. The better the national construction, the cheaper the industrial products will be."

    沈阳高坎村两个农业生产合作社
    卖给国家的三十万斤余粮已起运
    沈阳东郊高坎村高坎、兴隆两个农业生产合作社的一百一十五户农民决定把所有三十万斤余粮，完全卖给国家。兴隆农业生产合作社（简称兴隆社）早在十一月二十一日就开始把粮食送到指定的粮食公司去，到二十五日止，已经送去了三万斤粮。都是晒的最干的“黄马牙子”好玉米。
    两社都是采取集体售粮的办法，在打完场后不分到社员家中就将余粮集体卖给国家。卖出的粮食，是根据各家应得数量分配粮款。这个办法是兴隆社社员首先提出来的，在社员大会通过之后，高坎社也立即通过了这个办法。这样比分配下去再集中送粮，最少省了四次捣粮的手续，消灭了捣动时的糟损。
    兴隆社社员们一经接受国家过渡时期总路线的教育后，不仅立即决定把余粮卖给国家，而且积极进行运送工作。老赶车的关海林第一天送粮时夜十一时才回家，但他没有休息就立刻修理绳套，第二天刚刚早晨四点钟，他就把其余的四个赶车的叫起来装车。这时，青年团员林树柏、林成厚等知道了，都提早起床跑来帮助装车，一时来了二十多人，一齐下手，很快装好了车，赶早送粮。喂马的老头荆兆魁，主动地在社里给送粮人做好饭。赵德有感觉有一部分玉米还有些灰尘，就主动扬一遍，把灰尘吹走——所有这些都是他们主动做的义务工，既不是社内分工，也没有人提过得工分。
    高坎社社员赵恒玉，总共分得三千斤粮，他决定卖二千斤给国家。先前他发愁卖了钱没处放，后来知道了可以存到供销社的信贷部去，他说：“这比什么都好，就像人身上的血脉流通一样，不聚死疙瘩。”社主任张振发说：“粮食年年往上涨，玉米、高粱、大豆三种粮食平均比一九四九年提高了百分之三十七，可是白市布比一九四九年倒降低百分之二十二。一九五一年买一条红旗牌胶皮车胎要三百七十万元，今年二百九十七万元就可以买到。这都是共产党给农民带来的福利，当然社员们都愿意把粮食卖给国家，支援国家建设。国家建设的更好，工业品就更贱。”           （方青）
