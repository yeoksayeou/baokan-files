    [From Our Own Correspondent] As of December 25th, twenty-nine enterprises in the national non-ferrous metals industry had fulfilled their annual major product plans ahead of schedule. In the Northeast region, the units that completed their plans include twelve units such as the Shenyang Smelter, Non-Ferrous Metal Processing Factory, Factory 401, Yangjiazhai Mine, and Qingchengzi Mine; in the Central-South region, there are eleven units such as the Shuikoushan Mining Bureau, Xikuangshan Mining Bureau, Xihuashan Mine, and Pinggui Mining Bureau; in the Southwest region, there are four units such as Yunnan Tin Corporation and Huize Lead-Zinc Mine; in the East China region, there are two units such as the Shanghai Smelter and Tongguanshan Mining Bureau. It is estimated that by the end of the year, the annual production tasks for all seven major products of the national non-ferrous metals industry can be overfulfilled. Over the past year, workers in various non-ferrous metal industrial plants and mines have actively strived to complete production plans, playing a guaranteeing role in the production of national defense industries, machinery industries, and telecommunications equipment manufacturing industries.
    Currently, enterprises in the national non-ferrous metals industry are conducting summaries, focusing on shortcomings in this year's production, such as insufficient production balance, technology lagging behind production development, and more equipment and personal accidents, and are actively preparing for next year's production.

    现在，全国有色金属工业各企业正针对着今年生产中的生产不够均衡、技术落后于生产发展、设备与人身事故较多等缺点，进行总结，并积极进行明年生产准备工作。
