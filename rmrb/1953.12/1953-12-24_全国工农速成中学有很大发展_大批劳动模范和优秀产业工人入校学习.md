National Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary Schools have seen great development this year. There are currently 58 such schools nationwide, with over 28,000 students enrolled, an increase of 42 percent compared to the 1952 academic year. The proportion of worker students has also significantly increased, with a large number of labor models and outstanding industrial workers entering these schools during the summer vacation this year. National Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary Schools also sent their first batch of students with worker-peasant backgrounds to universities and colleges this year.

This year, the National Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary Schools enrolled a total of 11,537 new students, fulfilling 97 percent of the original enrollment plan. Among the new students, industrial workers accounted for 33 percent, and revolutionary cadres accounted for 59 percent. At the Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary School attached to Dalian Institute of Technology, 63.9 percent of the new students were industrial workers. Among the industrial workers, there were 327 labor models. Hang Peilan, a national textile industry model worker, has now entered the Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary School of the Renmin University of China to study. Jiang Wanshou, a national industrial labor model, Sun Xiaoju, a national railway labor model, Li Honglan, a national textile industry labor model, and Wang Fuji, who won the third-class merit award in Korea, have all entered the Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary Schools attached to Northeast Institute of Technology, Dalian Institute of Technology, and Northeast People's University, respectively. Gong Jinmei, a well-known factory protection model, is among the new students at the East China Accelerated Experimental School. Yang Meishan, a labor model, is among the new students at the Hunan Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary School. Among the revolutionary cadres, taking the Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary School of the Renmin University of China as an example, those who had received awards for meritorious service accounted for 22 percent.

The new students of the Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary Schools this year have made significant progress in political, health, and cultural conditions compared to the previous three years. According to statistics from 31 schools, Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members accounted for 87 percent of the new students. The average age of the new students is around 22 years old, and those with 6 to 15 years of work experience and revolutionary work experience accounted for 41 percent. Comparing the cultural level with the Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary School of the Renmin University of China, in 1950, 80 percent of the enrolled new students had not graduated from higher primary school; in 1951, it was 40 to 50 percent; in 1952, it was 15 to 25 percent; and this year, it was only 10 percent (most of whom are also close to graduating from higher primary school). With these conditions, it is more conducive for them to complete the six-year secondary school curriculum in three years.

This year, 19 Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary Schools nationwide had their first graduates, with a total of 1,680 graduates. According to statistics from 15 Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary Schools, workers accounted for 33.4 percent of the graduates, and revolutionary cadres accounted for 59.6 percent. The vast majority of these graduates have been admitted to universities and colleges, accounting for 99 percent of the graduates. Among the first graduates of the Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary School attached to Chongqing University, 87 out of 97 students, excluding a few who could not participate in the university entrance examination due to illness, have been admitted to universities and colleges, including 65 who were admitted to higher industrial schools. Among the first group of 295 graduates of the Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary School attached to Dalian Institute of Technology this year, 253 were admitted to universities and colleges. All 154 graduates from the first group of the Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary School attached to Northeast Institute of Technology were also admitted to universities and colleges. Some of these graduates were also selected as preparatory students for studying in the Soviet Union. Thirty-two students from the Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary School attached to Dalian Institute of Technology were selected as preparatory students for studying in the Soviet Union, and 14 students from the Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary School attached to Northeast Institute of Technology were selected as preparatory students for studying in the Soviet Union. The industrial workers and worker-peasant cadres studying in the Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary Schools are working very hard and have made great progress. There is a class composed of 39 labor models in the Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary School attached to Northeast Institute of Technology, and their scores in the last exam were all four and five. Tian Guiying, the first female train driver in New China, who is studying in this class, received full marks in six courses. Cao Jinhuai, a peasant cadre studying in the Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary School attached to Chongqing University, originally did not understand fractions in arithmetic. After three years of continuous efforts, he has now learned high school mathematics, physics, chemistry, and other courses, and his scores are all above four.

Since last year, half of the Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary Schools have been attached to universities and colleges, becoming preparatory classes for universities and colleges, and have implemented classified teaching plans since the fall of last year. After the Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary Schools were attached to universities and colleges, they received specific help and guidance from universities and colleges in terms of equipment and teaching; the curriculum was more closely connected with the curriculum of universities and colleges; therefore, it is conducive for students to concentrate on learning basic scientific knowledge well. In order to attract more workers, especially labor models, to enroll, the "worker return system" has been gradually implemented since this year. The industrial workers recommended by various enterprises are assigned as much as possible to the Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary Schools attached to universities and colleges that have majors related to the department. These workers will still return to their original departments to work after graduating from universities and colleges, in order to give play to the enthusiasm of various industrial departments in recommending workers to enroll in schools.

    全国工农速成中学有很大发展
    大批劳动模范和优秀产业工人入校学习
    全国工农速成中学今年有很大发展。全国现有工农速成中学五十八所，在校学生二万八千多人，比一九五二年学年度在校学生增加了百分之四十二。学生中的工人成分也显著增加，今年暑假有大批劳动模范和优秀产业工人进入了工农速成中学。全国工农速成中学今年并输送了第一批工农成分的学生进入高等学校。
    全国工农速成中学今年共招收新生一万一千五百三十七人，完成原招生计划的百分之九十七。今年的新生中产业工人占百分之三十三，革命干部占百分之五十九。大连工学院附设工农速成中学新生中有百分之六十三点九是产业工人。产业工人中有劳动模范三百二十七人。全国纺织工业模范杭佩兰现已进入中国人民大学工农速成中学学习，全国工业劳动模范姜万寿、全国铁路劳动模范孙孝菊、全国纺织工业劳动模范李洪兰和曾在朝鲜立过三等功的王福基等都已分别进入东北工学院、大连工学院和东北人民大学所附设的工农速成中学学习。华东速成实验学校的新生中有著名护厂模范龚金妹。湖南工农速成中学的新生中有劳动模范杨梅山。革命干部中，以中国人民大学工农速成中学为例，曾立功获奖的占百分之二十二。
    今年工农速成中学的新生在政治、健康、文化等条件上较以往三年有显著的进步。据三十一个学校的统计，新生中共产党员、青年团员占百分之八十七。新生的入学年龄平均在二十二岁左右，工龄和参加革命工作年限在六年以上到十五年的占百分之四十一。文化程度以中国人民大学工农速成中学一校来作比较，一九五○年录取新生不及高小毕业程度的占百分之八十，一九五一年占百分之四十到五十，一九五二年占百分之十五到二十五，而今年只占百分之十（其中大部分也接近于高小毕业程度）。有了这些条件，就更有利于他们在三年中学完中学六年的课程。
    今年全国有十九所工农速成中学有了第一届毕业生，共毕业学生一千六百八十人。根据十五所工农速成中学的统计，毕业生中工人成分占百分之三十三点四，革命干部占百分之五十九点六。这批毕业生绝大部分都升入了高等学校，录取数占百分之九十九。重庆大学附设工农速成中学第一届毕业生有九十七人，除了几个因病不能参加高等学校入学考试外，已有八十七人考入了高等学校，其中考入高等工业学校的有六十五人。大连工学院附设工农速成中学今年第一期毕业生二百九十五人中有二百五十三人考进了高等学校。东北工学院附设工农速成中学第一期毕业生一百五十四人也全部被高等学校录取。这些毕业生中还有一部分被选拔为赴苏联留学的预备生，大连工学院附设工农速成中学被选拔为赴苏联留学预备生的有三十二人，东北工学院附设工农速成中学被选拔为赴苏联留学预备生的有十四人。在工农速成中学学习的产业工人和工农干部都很努力，并有很大进步。东北工学院附设工农速成中学有一个由三十九个劳动模范组成的班，他们上期考试成绩都是四分和五分。在该班学习的新中国第一个女火车司机田桂英有六门课程都得到了满分。在重庆大学附设工农速成中学学习的农民干部曹金怀，原来连算术中的分数都不懂，经过三年来不断努力，他现在已学懂高中的数学、物理和化学等课程，成绩都在四分以上。
    工农速成中学从去年开始就有半数附设于高等学校，成为高等学校的预备班，并从去年秋季开始实行分类教学计划。工农速成中学附设于高等学校后，在设备及教学方面，得到了高等学校的具体帮助和指导；在课程上，和高等学校的课程衔接得更为密切；因而有利于学生集中精力学好基础科学知识。为了争取更多的工人、特别是劳动模范入学，从今年起逐步实行“工人返还制”，各企业保送的产业工人尽可能分配到设有与该部门有关专业的高等学校附设工农速成中学学习。这些工人在高等学校毕业后仍返回原部门工作，以发挥各产业部门保送工人入学的积极性。　（新华社）
