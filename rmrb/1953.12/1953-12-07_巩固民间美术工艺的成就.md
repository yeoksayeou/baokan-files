The National Exhibition of Folk Art and Crafts has officially opened in Beijing. It offers a relatively comprehensive collection and introduction to folk art and crafts. Of course, these exhibits are only a part of the folk art and crafts; there must be many items that have been missed, and some lack sufficient representation. However, even so, the content of this exhibition is already quite rich.

More than twenty provinces and twenty ethnic groups have exhibits participating. The types of exhibits include ceramics, dyed and embroidered textiles, sculptures, metal crafts, lacquerware, woven goods, New Year pictures and paper cuttings, and other various arts and crafts.

In ceramics, there are porcelain pieces from Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangdong, Hebei, Shandong, Shaanxi, Zhejiang, Henan, Shanxi, and other provinces, and pottery from Jiangsu, Guangdong, Sichuan, Hunan, Anhui, Yunnan, and other provinces, as well as from the Tibetan, Dai, and Gaoshan ethnic groups. These ceramics include both practical and decorative pieces. Different porcelain and pottery clays, different glazes, and different decorative methods are used to create a variety of different objects.

In dyed and embroidered textiles, there are blue printed cloth, color printed cloth, silk fabrics, cotton fabrics, woolen fabrics, embroidery, patchwork, drawnwork, tapestry, and so on. Blue printed cloth alone comes from Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Hunan, Hubei, Shaanxi, Jiangxi, Hebei, Shanxi, Anhui, Guangxi, Liaoxi, and other provinces. Although they are all blue printed cloth, the styles of the patterns are different in different regions. At the same time, there are many variations in the patterns.

In sculptures, there are wood carvings, stone carvings, jade carvings, brick carvings, bamboo carvings, ivory carvings, bone carvings, clay sculptures, dough figurines, and so on. Wood carvings alone have exhibits from Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Fujian, Hebei, Jiangxi, Anhui, Henan, and other provinces, as well as from the Gaoshan ethnic group. In terms of wood carving techniques, there are woodcuts, sculptures in the round, reliefs, multi-layered high reliefs, openwork reliefs, and so on.

In metal crafts, there are cloisonn√©, enamelled porcelain, silverware, filigree, bronzeware, tinware, ironwork, and various long and short knives from the Tibetan, Dai, Miao, Yao, and Yi ethnic groups.

In lacquerware, there are products from Fujian, Sichuan, Shandong, Hebei, Shanxi, Zhejiang, Guizhou, Anhui, and other provinces, as well as from the Yi ethnic group. Some use wood as a base, some use metal as a base, some use leather as a base, and some lacquerware from Fuzhou, Fujian, is made using the dry lacquer technique. There are also various different methods of decorating lacquerware, such as gold tracing, lacquer painting, raised lacquer, carved lacquer, deep carving, shallow carving, and inlay.

In woven goods, there are objects woven from grass, bamboo, palm, hemp, and rattan, with exhibits from Shandong, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Fujian, Hunan, Anhui, Shaanxi, Yunnan, Qinghai, Guangxi, Liaoxi, and other provinces and ethnic minorities.

From these exhibits, we can not only see the richness of folk art and crafts, but also clearly see its relationship with people's lives. Whether in clothing, food utensils, houses and furniture, or vehicles and luggage, everything is related to folk art and crafts. Many things are both practical and artistic.

Even a seemingly small bowl, a piece of cloth, a piece of woodenware or bamboo ware, constantly encourages people's love for life and increases their enthusiasm for labor in everyday life. The creation of these folk arts and crafts is due to the people's material needs and their spiritual needs. Over the past four thousand years, accumulated bit by bit, they have become a glorious and splendid part of the motherland's culture.

These exhibits very clearly demonstrate the high wisdom of the Chinese working people. No matter what material, even waste fruit peels, can be used by the Chinese working people to make exquisite objects. At the same time, no matter what tool, can be used by the Chinese working people to exert its effectiveness and performance at will, thereby creating various different expression methods and expression forms.

Similarly, these exhibits also tell us that folk art and crafts not only have cultural and artistic value, but more importantly, they also have economic value. Therefore, folk art and crafts are not just a matter of artistic creation, but a production undertaking related to millions of people. The production of these folk art and crafts has historically been an important part of the national economic income. As early as the Han Dynasty, silk fabrics and other handicrafts were exported to the Western Regions in exchange for materials needed by the people.

From the variety of these exhibits and the widespread distribution of production areas, we can also know that folk art and crafts are still a fairly important production undertaking today. It employs a large number of workers. For example, the main producing areas of ceramics and dyed fabrics often have thousands or tens of thousands of professional workers, and thousands or tens of thousands of people rely on these productions as a sideline.

These folk arts and crafts have been a very important sideline in rural areas since ancient times. It not only increases the economic income of farmers, but also cultivates their wisdom and enriches their spiritual life through creative activities carried out during slack farming seasons. For example, pottery, wood carving, stone carving, clay sculpture, and weaving are generally sideline productions in rural areas. In a village in Laiyang County, Shandong, 150 out of 200 households can carve talc. In Xiangyuan, Yanta, and other villages in the suburbs of Fuzhou City, Fujian Province, there are still about 600 people who can carve wood carvings. In the area where Laiyang, Pingdu, and Changyi counties in Shandong Province meet, all rural women in about 500 villages can weave straw braid.

It is also due to the creativity of the farmers that folk art and crafts have always maintained a simple style. This style is in stark contrast to the low-level tastes in the cities that have been influenced by imperialist colonial culture. Today, we must inherit the simple style of folk art and crafts to resolutely eliminate the influence of colonial culture.

These folk art and crafts are also a type of production suitable for the vast number of women. For example, in the suburbs of Shanghai, Changshu and Wuxi in Jiangsu, Shaoxing, Xiaoshan, and Yuyao in Zhejiang, Yantai and southern Shandong, about 100,000 women engage in lace and drawnwork as sideline production. In Suzhou City and its surrounding rural areas, about 20,000 people engage in embroidery as sideline production. In Chaozhou and Shantou in Guangdong, as many as hundreds of thousands of people are engaged in embroidery, drawnwork, and other work.

Therefore, folk art and crafts are a production undertaking related to millions of people. Although some of these folk art and crafts are indeed no longer suitable for the needs of the people today, even so, we cannot completely dismiss them, because these techniques have inherited thousands of years of experience and tradition, and we can still use these techniques and develop them. Arts and crafts are indispensable in life, and they are needed in all aspects of life. This is certain. The Chinese people have made brilliant achievements in this area for thousands of years, and today we have the obligation to consolidate these achievements, to inherit these achievements, and to steadily develop them according to the development of the people's needs.

Currently, there are many problems in the production of folk art and crafts, the most important of which is the issue of sales.

The maintenance, transformation, and development of folk art and craft production is first determined by its sales. In recent decades, on the one hand, it has been affected by the planned economic aggression of imperialist countries, and on the other hand, it has been oppressed by the exorbitant taxes and levies during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. The production of folk art and crafts has been declining day by day. Especially in the years before liberation, the materials of American imperialism completely engulfed the market. At that time, the production of folk art and crafts had reached the point of being on the verge of death. Many folk art and craft productions were stopped, and countless excellent folk artists became unemployed and changed careers during this period. At that time, the experience and tradition accumulated over thousands of years were on the verge of extinction. Fortunately, the whole country was liberated, and folk art and crafts finally survived the crisis. In recent years, they have been gradually recovering. Some regions have received the care and support of the people's government and the people, established production cooperatives, and carried out loans, organization of production, and sales, etc., so that some craft productions have been developed. However, many types of crafts are still in a state of stagnation or semi-stagnation. Judging from the needs of the people across the country, the output of folk art and crafts is not oversupplied. The main thing is that production and sales have not been well organized, especially in terms of ideology, there has not been good leadership. The production of folk art and crafts was originally backward, scattered, and blind. Today, the essence of society has completely changed, but the nature of folk art and craft production has not changed. It is still following the old path that it followed in the old society. As a result, some products have become unsalable, which is an inevitable result.

Today, relevant leaders in various regions should conduct serious research on local folk art and crafts, and separately identify the objects of their sales, determine which of these products are mainly for domestic sales, which are mainly for export, which should be oriented to the daily life of the general public, and which should further improve their artistry so that they become independent works of art. In such work, we should try to avoid adopting a completely negative attitude towards the existing various crafts. A folk art and craft can become a production undertaking and can be passed down for a long time, it must have its characteristics and it must have its advantages. Therefore, we cannot treat it with a rough attitude of complete negation. In short, any reform of folk art and crafts must take into account its original foundation.

Relevant leaders in various regions should attach importance to these folk art and crafts, because they reflect the wisdom and creativity of the people of all regions and ethnic groups, and have the responsibility to support these local folk art and crafts and try to inherit and promote its traditions. For the crafts most needed in the daily life of the people across the country, we should study how to transform them so that they can conform to the spirit of the general line to strengthen their low price and good quality. For the crafts that can be exported to exchange for materials needed in construction work, we should also study how to improve them so that they can meet the needs of the people of fraternal countries and ensure the quality of these raw products. For the crafts that can be used as exhibits and gifts in foreign cultural exchanges, we should also study how to determine its standards and organize creation, because it represents the Chinese people's achievements in culture and art. We should adopt a serious attitude and prepare for these foreign exhibits in a planned way.

If so, it can solve the sales problem of folk art and craft production to some extent. At the same time, it can also eliminate the influence of colonial culture on daily necessities, promote national forms, and gradually achieve low prices and good quality. In foreign cultural exchange work, it can also be done in a planned and step-by-step manner to introduce our people's creations and achievements in arts and crafts.

When the main problems are solved, other problems such as folk artists, design leadership, cadre training, etc. can also be solved step by step. For folk artists, most of them are elderly people over the age of 50. Some of these artists have changed careers, and some are still unemployed. Relevant leaders in various regions also attach great importance to them and have been providing them with continuous relief in recent years, but relief is not a fundamental solution. We must organize them to produce, let them continue to do the work they are good at, and let them give full play to their skilled techniques and their wisdom.

On the issue of design leadership and cadre training, it is necessary to organize professional art workers to go deep into the craft production work, to understand the needs of the people, to understand the conditions of manufacturing, to understand the tradition of folk art and crafts, and to engage in steady reform work together with the artists on the existing basis. To carry out the leadership of design and the training of cadres in practical production work, to prepare conditions for the future development of the art and craft industry.

Our country's folk art and crafts have a long history of thousands of years. It has enriched the people's spiritual life and material life. It has cultural and artistic value and economic value. At the same time, it has very brilliant achievements. Today, we have the responsibility to consolidate its achievements.
