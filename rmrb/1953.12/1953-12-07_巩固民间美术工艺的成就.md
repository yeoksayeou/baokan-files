The National Exhibition of Folk Art and Crafts has officially opened in Beijing. It offers a relatively comprehensive collection and introduction to folk art and crafts. Of course, these exhibits are only a part of the folk art and crafts; there must be many items that have been missed, and some lack sufficient representation. However, even so, the content of this exhibition is already quite rich.

More than twenty provinces and twenty ethnic groups have exhibits participating. The types of exhibits include ceramics, dyed and embroidered textiles, sculptures, metal crafts, lacquerware, woven goods, New Year pictures and paper cuttings, and other various arts and crafts.

In ceramics, there are porcelain pieces from Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangdong, Hebei, Shandong, Shaanxi, Zhejiang, Henan, Shanxi, and other provinces, and pottery from Jiangsu, Guangdong, Sichuan, Hunan, Anhui, Yunnan, and other provinces, as well as from the Tibetan, Dai, and Gaoshan ethnic groups. These ceramics include both practical and decorative pieces. Different porcelain and pottery clays, different glazes, and different decorative methods are used to create a variety of different objects.

In dyed and embroidered textiles, there are blue printed cloth, color printed cloth, silk fabrics, cotton fabrics, woolen fabrics, embroidery, patchwork, drawnwork, tapestry, and so on. Blue printed cloth alone comes from Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Hunan, Hubei, Shaanxi, Jiangxi, Hebei, Shanxi, Anhui, Guangxi, Liaoxi, and other provinces. Although they are all blue printed cloth, the styles of the patterns are different in different regions. At the same time, there are many variations in the patterns.

In sculptures, there are wood carvings, stone carvings, jade carvings, brick carvings, bamboo carvings, ivory carvings, bone carvings, clay sculptures, dough figurines, and so on. Wood carvings alone have exhibits from Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Fujian, Hebei, Jiangxi, Anhui, Henan, and other provinces, as well as from the Gaoshan ethnic group. In terms of wood carving techniques, there are woodcuts, sculptures in the round, reliefs, multi-layered high reliefs, openwork reliefs, and so on.

In metal crafts, there are cloisonné, enamelled porcelain, silverware, filigree, bronzeware, tinware, ironwork, and various long and short knives from the Tibetan, Dai, Miao, Yao, and Yi ethnic groups.

In lacquerware, there are products from Fujian, Sichuan, Shandong, Hebei, Shanxi, Zhejiang, Guizhou, Anhui, and other provinces, as well as from the Yi ethnic group. Some use wood as a base, some use metal as a base, some use leather as a base, and some lacquerware from Fuzhou, Fujian, is made using the dry lacquer technique. There are also various different methods of decorating lacquerware, such as gold tracing, lacquer painting, raised lacquer, carved lacquer, deep carving, shallow carving, and inlay.

In woven goods, there are objects woven from grass, bamboo, palm, hemp, and rattan, with exhibits from Shandong, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Fujian, Hunan, Anhui, Shaanxi, Yunnan, Qinghai, Guangxi, Liaoxi, and other provinces and ethnic minorities.

From these exhibits, we can not only see the richness of folk art and crafts, but also clearly see its relationship with people's lives. Whether in clothing, food utensils, houses and furniture, or vehicles and luggage, everything is related to folk art and crafts. Many things are both practical and artistic.

Even a seemingly small bowl, a piece of cloth, a piece of woodenware or bamboo ware, constantly encourages people's love for life and increases their enthusiasm for labor in everyday life. The creation of these folk arts and crafts is due to the people's material needs and their spiritual needs. Over the past four thousand years, accumulated bit by bit, they have become a glorious and splendid part of the motherland's culture.

These exhibits very clearly demonstrate the high wisdom of the Chinese working people. No matter what material, even waste fruit peels, can be used by the Chinese working people to make exquisite objects. At the same time, no matter what tool, can be used by the Chinese working people to exert its effectiveness and performance at will, thereby creating various different expression methods and expression forms.

Similarly, these exhibits also tell us that folk art and crafts not only have cultural and artistic value, but more importantly, they also have economic value. Therefore, folk art and crafts are not just a matter of artistic creation, but a production undertaking related to millions of people. The production of these folk art and crafts has historically been an important part of the national economic income. As early as the Han Dynasty, silk fabrics and other handicrafts were exported to the Western Regions in exchange for materials needed by the people.

From the variety of these exhibits and the widespread distribution of production areas, we can also know that folk art and crafts are still a fairly important production undertaking today. It employs a large number of workers. For example, the main producing areas of ceramics and dyed fabrics often have thousands or tens of thousands of professional workers, and thousands or tens of thousands of people rely on these productions as a sideline.

These folk arts and crafts have been a very important sideline in rural areas since ancient times. It not only increases the economic income of farmers, but also cultivates their wisdom and enriches their spiritual life through creative activities carried out during slack farming seasons. For example, pottery, wood carving, stone carving, clay sculpture, and weaving are generally sideline productions in rural areas. In a village in Laiyang County, Shandong, 150 out of 200 households can carve talc. In Xiangyuan, Yanta, and other villages in the suburbs of Fuzhou City, Fujian Province, there are still about 600 people who can carve wood carvings. In the area where Laiyang, Pingdu, and Changyi counties in Shandong Province meet, all rural women in about 500 villages can weave straw braid.

It is also due to the creativity of the farmers that folk art and crafts have always maintained a simple style. This style is in stark contrast to the low-level tastes in the cities that have been influenced by imperialist colonial culture. Today, we must inherit the simple style of folk art and crafts to resolutely eliminate the influence of colonial culture.

These folk art and crafts are also a type of production suitable for the vast number of women. For example, in the suburbs of Shanghai, Changshu and Wuxi in Jiangsu, Shaoxing, Xiaoshan, and Yuyao in Zhejiang, Yantai and southern Shandong, about 100,000 women engage in lace and drawnwork as sideline production. In Suzhou City and its surrounding rural areas, about 20,000 people engage in embroidery as sideline production. In Chaozhou and Shantou in Guangdong, as many as hundreds of thousands of people are engaged in embroidery, drawnwork, and other work.

Therefore, folk art and crafts are a production undertaking related to millions of people. Although some of these folk art and crafts are indeed no longer suitable for the needs of the people today, even so, we cannot completely dismiss them, because these techniques have inherited thousands of years of experience and tradition, and we can still use these techniques and develop them. Arts and crafts are indispensable in life, and they are needed in all aspects of life. This is certain. The Chinese people have made brilliant achievements in this area for thousands of years, and today we have the obligation to consolidate these achievements, to inherit these achievements, and to steadily develop them according to the development of the people's needs.

Currently, there are many problems in the production of folk art and crafts, the most important of which is the issue of sales.

The maintenance, transformation, and development of folk art and craft production is first determined by its sales. In recent decades, on the one hand, it has been affected by the planned economic aggression of imperialist countries, and on the other hand, it has been oppressed by the exorbitant taxes and levies during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. The production of folk art and crafts has been declining day by day. Especially in the years before liberation, the materials of American imperialism completely engulfed the market. At that time, the production of folk art and crafts had reached the point of being on the verge of death. Many folk art and craft productions were stopped, and countless excellent folk artists became unemployed and changed careers during this period. At that time, the experience and tradition accumulated over thousands of years were on the verge of extinction. Fortunately, the whole country was liberated, and folk art and crafts finally survived the crisis. In recent years, they have been gradually recovering. Some regions have received the care and support of the people's government and the people, established production cooperatives, and carried out loans, organization of production, and sales, etc., so that some craft productions have been developed. However, many types of crafts are still in a state of stagnation or semi-stagnation. Judging from the needs of the people across the country, the output of folk art and crafts is not oversupplied. The main thing is that production and sales have not been well organized, especially in terms of ideology, there has not been good leadership. The production of folk art and crafts was originally backward, scattered, and blind. Today, the essence of society has completely changed, but the nature of folk art and craft production has not changed. It is still following the old path that it followed in the old society. As a result, some products have become unsalable, which is an inevitable result.

Today, relevant leaders in various regions should conduct serious research on local folk art and crafts, and separately identify the objects of their sales, determine which of these products are mainly for domestic sales, which are mainly for export, which should be oriented to the daily life of the general public, and which should further improve their artistry so that they become independent works of art. In such work, we should try to avoid adopting a completely negative attitude towards the existing various crafts. A folk art and craft can become a production undertaking and can be passed down for a long time, it must have its characteristics and it must have its advantages. Therefore, we cannot treat it with a rough attitude of complete negation. In short, any reform of folk art and crafts must take into account its original foundation.

Relevant leaders in various regions should attach importance to these folk art and crafts, because they reflect the wisdom and creativity of the people of all regions and ethnic groups, and have the responsibility to support these local folk art and crafts and try to inherit and promote its traditions. For the crafts most needed in the daily life of the people across the country, we should study how to transform them so that they can conform to the spirit of the general line to strengthen their low price and good quality. For the crafts that can be exported to exchange for materials needed in construction work, we should also study how to improve them so that they can meet the needs of the people of fraternal countries and ensure the quality of these raw products. For the crafts that can be used as exhibits and gifts in foreign cultural exchanges, we should also study how to determine its standards and organize creation, because it represents the Chinese people's achievements in culture and art. We should adopt a serious attitude and prepare for these foreign exhibits in a planned way.

If so, it can solve the sales problem of folk art and craft production to some extent. At the same time, it can also eliminate the influence of colonial culture on daily necessities, promote national forms, and gradually achieve low prices and good quality. In foreign cultural exchange work, it can also be done in a planned and step-by-step manner to introduce our people's creations and achievements in arts and crafts.

When the main problems are solved, other problems such as folk artists, design leadership, cadre training, etc. can also be solved step by step. For folk artists, most of them are elderly people over the age of 50. Some of these artists have changed careers, and some are still unemployed. Relevant leaders in various regions also attach great importance to them and have been providing them with continuous relief in recent years, but relief is not a fundamental solution. We must organize them to produce, let them continue to do the work they are good at, and let them give full play to their skilled techniques and their wisdom.

On the issue of design leadership and cadre training, it is necessary to organize professional art workers to go deep into the craft production work, to understand the needs of the people, to understand the conditions of manufacturing, to understand the tradition of folk art and crafts, and to engage in steady reform work together with the artists on the existing basis. To carry out the leadership of design and the training of cadres in practical production work, to prepare conditions for the future development of the art and craft industry.

Our country's folk art and crafts have a long history of thousands of years. It has enriched the people's spiritual life and material life. It has cultural and artistic value and economic value. At the same time, it has very brilliant achievements. Today, we have the responsibility to consolidate its achievements.

    巩固民间美术工艺的成就
    庞薰?
    全国民间美术工艺展览会在北京正式展出了。它对民间美术工艺作了比较全面性的搜集与介绍。当然这些展品也还只是民间美术工艺品中间的一部分，一定还有很多东西是遗漏掉了，同时也有些东西还缺乏充分的代表性。但是即使如此，这个展览会的内容已经相当丰富。
    二十几个省，二十多个民族有展品参加。展品的种类中包括了陶瓷器、染织刺绣品、雕塑品、金属工艺品、漆器、编织物、年画剪纸及其它各种美术工艺品等。
    在陶瓷器中有江西、福建、广东、河北、山东、陕西、浙江、河南、山西等省的瓷器，和江苏、广东、四川、湖南、安徽、云南等省及藏族、傣族、高山族的陶器。在这些陶瓷器中有实用陶瓷与装饰陶瓷。用不同的瓷土与陶土，用不同的釉料，用不同的装饰方法来制成各种不同的器物。
    在染织刺绣品中，包括了蓝印花布、彩印花布、丝织、棉织、毛织、刺绣、挑补花、抽纱、缂丝等等。单单蓝印花布就有浙江、江苏、湖南、湖北、陕西、江西、河北、山西、安徽、广西、辽西等省的产品。虽然同样是蓝印花布，但是在图案的风格上，各地不尽相同。同时图案的变化很多。
    在雕塑品中包括了木雕、石雕、玉雕、砖雕、竹刻、牙雕、骨刻、泥塑、面塑等等。单单木雕就有浙江、江苏、广东、福建、河北、江西、安徽、河南等省及高山族的展品。在木雕的技术方面，有木刻、圆雕、浮雕、多层次的高浮雕、镂空浮雕等等。
    在金属工艺品中包括了景泰蓝、烧瓷、银器、花丝、铜器、锡器、铁花及藏、傣、苗、瑶、彝等族的各种长短刀等等。
    在漆器中有福建、四川、山东、河北、山西、浙江、贵州、安徽等省及彝族的产品。有的用木胎，有的用金属作胎，有的用皮革作胎，而福建福州的漆器，有些是用脱胎的方法来制造的。在漆器的装饰方法上也有种种不同的方法，如描金、漆画、堆漆、雕漆、深刻、浅刻、镶嵌等等。
    在编织物中，包括了用草、竹、棕、麻、藤编成的器物，有山东、广东、浙江、福建、湖南、安徽、陕西、云南、青海、广西、辽西等省及少数民族的展品。
    从这些展品中，不但可以看出民间美术工艺的丰富，而且很清楚的可以看出它和人民生活的关系。无论衣着服饰方面，饮食用具方面，房屋家具方面，车船行装方面都是与民间美术工艺有关系的，很多东西一方面是实用的，同时有它的艺术性。
    即使是看起来很微小的一只碗，一块布，一件木器或竹器，它们在生活中间随时随地的鼓励了人民对生活的热爱，提高了人民对劳动的热情。这些民间美术工艺的创制就因为人民在物质上有这需要、在精神上也同样有这需要。四千多年来，点点滴滴的累积起来，成为祖国文化中光辉灿烂的一部分。
    这些展品，非常明显地表现了中国劳动人民高度的智慧，无论任何材料，甚至于废料果壳，一到中国劳动人民的手里，都能利用它来制成精美绝伦的器物。同时无论任何工具，一到中国劳动人民的手里，都能随心所欲，发挥它的效用与性能，由此创造了各种不同的表现方法与表现形式。
    同样这些展品也告诉我们，民间美术工艺不仅仅是有它的文化艺术的价值，更重要的它还有经济的价值。所以民间美术工艺不只是艺术创作问题，而是与几百万人民有关的一种生产事业。这些民间美术工艺的生产，在历史上曾经成为国家经济收入的一个重要部分。远在汉代就向西域输出丝织品等工艺品，去交换人民所需要的物资。
    从这些展品种类的繁多和生产地区的遍及各地等等方面去看，也就可以知道民间美术工艺至今还是相当重要的一种生产事业。它拥有大量工人。如陶瓷器与染织品等的主要产地，往往就有上千成万专业工人，和上千成万的人依靠这些生产作为副业。
    这些民间美术工艺，从古以来就是农村中的一种很重要的副业，它不仅增加了农民们的经济收入，而且这种利用了农闲时间来进行的创作活动，培养了农民们的智慧，丰富了他们的精神生活。如陶器、木雕、石雕、泥塑、编织，一般说来都是农村中的副业生产。山东掖县的一个村庄，二百户人家中有一百五十户能雕刻滑石。福建福州市郊的象园、雁塔等村落，能雕木雕的现在还有六百人左右。在山东掖南、平度、昌邑三县的交界地区约有五百个村庄的全部农村妇女都能编织草帽辫。
    也依靠了农民们的创造，使得美术工艺始终还保存着朴实的风格。而这种风格与城市中受了帝国主义殖民地文化影响的低级趣味成了强烈的对照。今天就要承继民间美术工艺中朴实的风格，来坚决肃清殖民地文化的影响。
    这些民间美术工艺，也是适合于广大妇女的一种生产，例如在上海郊区，江苏的常熟、无锡，浙江的绍兴、萧山、余姚，山东的烟台及鲁南，以花边抽绣作为副业生产的，约有十余万妇女。在苏州市内及市郊农村中，以刺绣作为副业生产的就有二万人左右。在广东的潮州、汕头，从事刺绣抽纱等工作的，竟有数十万人之多。
    所以民间美术工艺是与几百万人民有关的一种生产事业。虽然在这些民间美术工艺中间，有些确实已经不适合于今天人民的需要，但是即使如此，也不能把它一笔抹煞，因为这些技术是承继了几千年来的经验与传统，我们仍然可以利用这些技术并加以发展。美术工艺是生活中间所不能缺少的，在生活的各方面都需要它，这一点是肯定的。几千年来中国人民在这方面已经有了光辉的成就，今天我们就有义务去巩固这成就，去承继这成就，根据人民需要的发展去稳步发展它。
    目前在民间美术工艺生产中，存在着不少问题，其中最主要的是销路问题。
    民间美术工艺生产的维持、改造和发展，首先决定于它的销路。近几十年来一方面受到帝国主义国家有计划的经济侵略的影响，一方面受到国民党反动统治时期的苛捐杂税的压迫，民间美术工艺生产一天一天地走着下坡路。尤其在解放前几年中，美帝国主义的物资完全吞没了市场，那个时候，民间美术工艺生产已经到了奄奄一息的地步，不少民间美术工艺停止了生产，无数优秀的民间艺人在这个时期中失业与改业。那时眼看几千年积累下来的经验与传统将要绝传。幸而全国得到了解放，民间美术工艺总算绝处逢生，这几年来在逐渐恢复。有些地区得到了人民政府和人民对它的关怀和支持，成立了生产合作社，进行了贷款、组织生产和推销等等，使某些工艺生产得到了发展。但是还有不少种类的工艺，仍旧处在停顿或半停顿的状态中。根据全国人民的需要量来看，民间美术工艺的产量并不是供过于求，主要的在生产上和销售上，没有很好地组织起来，尤其在思想上没有很好地去领导它。民间美术工艺的生产原来是落后的、分散的、盲目的，今天社会的本质已经完全改变，而民间美术工艺生产的性质却没有改变，它现在所走的路还是旧社会中所走的一条老路。于是有些产品就发生了滞销，这是必然的结果。
    今天各地有关领导方面应该对于各地的民间美术工艺，加以认真研究，分别找出它们销售的对象来，确定这些产品，那一些主要是内销的，那一些主要是外销的，那一些应面向人民大众的日常生活，那一些应更提高它的艺术性，使它成为独立的艺术品。在这样的工作中间，对于既有的各种工艺，应该尽量避免采取完全否定的态度。一种民间美术工艺能成为一种生产事业，能长时期的流传下来，一定有它的特点，也一定有它的优点。所以不能用一笔抹煞的粗暴态度来对待它。总之，对民间美术工艺进行任何改革，必须顾到它原有的基础。
    各地有关领导应该重视这些民间美术工艺，因为它反映了各地各族人民的智慧与创造，有责任扶植这些地方民间美术工艺与设法承继发扬它的传统。对于全国人民日常生活中所最需要的工艺应研究如何加以改造，使得它能符合于总路线的精神，来加强它的价廉物美。对于可以外销来换取建设工作中所需物资的工艺也应研究如何改进，使它能适合于兄弟国家人民的需要，和保证这些生产品的质量。对于可以作为对外文化交流中的展品与礼品的工艺又应研究如何去决定它的标准与组织创作，因为它代表了中国人民在文化上与艺术上的造就，对于这些对外展品，我们应该采取严肃的态度和有计划的来准备。
    假若这样，多少可以解决民间美术工艺生产的销路。同时也可以在日常用品上，肃清殖民地文化的影响，来发扬民族形式，逐步做到价廉物美。在对外文化交流工作中，也可以做到有计划有步骤地来进行介绍我国人民在美术工艺方面的创造与成就。
    主要的问题得到了解决，其他如民间艺人的问题，设计领导的问题，干部培养的问题等等也都可以一步一步地得到解决。对于民间艺人，他们多数是五十岁以上的老人，这些艺人有的已经改业，有的还失业，各地有关领导方面对他们也很重视，这几年来对他们不断的给予救济，但是救济不是一个根本解决办法，要组织他们生产，让他们继续做自己擅长的工作，让他们尽量发挥熟练的技术和自己的智慧。
    在设计领导和干部培养的问题上，要组织专业美术工作者，深入到工艺生产工作中间去，熟悉人民的需要，熟悉制造的条件，熟悉民间美术工艺的传统，在现有的基础上与艺人一起从事稳步的改革工作。在实际生产工作中来进行设计的领导与干部的培养，为将来工艺美术事业的发展准备条件。
    我国的民间美术工艺，有数千年悠久的历史，它丰富了人民的精神生活与物质生活，它具有文化艺术的价值与经济的价值。同时它有着非常辉煌的成就。今天我们有责任来巩固它的成就。
