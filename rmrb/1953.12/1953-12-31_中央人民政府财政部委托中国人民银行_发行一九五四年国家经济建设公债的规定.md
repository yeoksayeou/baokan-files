    The Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government entrusts the People's Bank of China to issue the regulations for the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds.
    I. The printing, issuance, collection of bond payments, principal and interest repayment, bond recovery and destruction, and other related matters of the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds (hereinafter referred to as "the Bonds") shall be handled by the People's Bank of China.
    II. The issuance period of the Bonds is from January 1, 1954, to September 30, 1954, and interest will be calculated from October 1st. To take care of the interests of those who pay during the issuance period, an interest subsidy method is adopted: those who pay in January 1954 will receive an interest subsidy of eight-twelfths of the annual interest; those who pay in February will receive an interest subsidy of seven-twelfths of the annual interest; those who pay in March will receive an interest subsidy of six-twelfths of the annual interest; and so on; those who pay in September will not receive an interest subsidy. Those who pay after the Bonds start accruing interest shall be exempt from paying any supplementary interest. Debt collection will cease in December.
    III. Bond payments should be made in Renminbi. If gold, silver dollars, silver, foreign currency, or foreign exchange are used for purchase, they should first be converted into Renminbi at the exchange rate of the designated bank before payment.
    IV. Overseas Chinese of all countries and their enterprises within China who wish to purchase the Bonds shall enjoy the same treatment as the Chinese people.
    V. Bond payment deposit procedures shall be handled in accordance with the regulations of the Central Treasury.
    VI. Local People's Banks and their subordinate institutions shall handle the issuance and collection of payments for the Bonds. If the bonds have not been received at the beginning, temporary receipts may be issued and given to the payers, who can then exchange them for formal bonds later.
