    Kunlun County, Shandong Province, Solves the Difficulties of Perennial Impoverished Households by Organizing Production
    Shi Zhensheng
    The production and living standards of farmers in the Third District of Kunlun County, Shandong Province, are generally improving year by year. In 1951, the average yield per mu was 262 jin, exceeding the pre-war average yield per mu by 37%; in 1952, the average yield per mu was 368 jin, exceeding the pre-war average yield per mu by 54%. However, there are still some farmers whose production and living standards have not improved, and have even declined. This spring, 698 impoverished households were identified in the district, totaling 1,799 people, accounting for 9% of the total number of households in the district and 5% of the total population. These households mostly belong to widowers, widows, orphans, or those with illnesses. They own a total of 4,520 mu of land, accounting for 5% of the total land area of the district, but the yield is very low, generally around 200 jin per mu, with some as low as 150 jin, and the lowest at 80 or 90 jin. The average yield per mu is about 150 jin less than that of ordinary farmers (368 jin per mu).

    Since the beginning of spring, the Third District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has criticized the complacent thinking of "bumper harvest without disasters" and bureaucratic work style among cadres. Starting from the grassroots level, they began to solve the production and living problems of impoverished households. In addition to providing relief funds of over 23 million yuan, over 300 jin of relief grain, over 5,000 jin of dried sweet potatoes, and over 6,000 jin of grass to some households in need of relief, the following methods were adopted based on specific circumstances to solve the production difficulties of impoverished households: (1) Using the method of mutual assistance among relatives and neighbors, the difficulties of 170 households were resolved. (2) Using the method of hiring cattle for plowing, the difficulties of 120 households were resolved, with prices negotiated mutually based on reasonable principles. (3) Absorbing impoverished households into mutual aid teams or adjusting a portion of land under trusteeship for them to cultivate. This method solved the difficulties of over 90 households. (4) Having fixed mutual aid teams or households cultivate land on their behalf, recording work points, and paying wages after cultivation. This method solved the difficulties of over 80 households. (5) Using the method of exchanging rough labor for fine labor, that is, households with labor power helping impoverished households with plowing and harvesting, and impoverished households helping households with labor power with odd jobs, resolved the difficulties of over 80 households. (6) Using the method of contracting the portion of land that impoverished households could not cultivate themselves, the difficulties of over 50 households were resolved. (7) Using the methods of dividing the harvest or renting out land, the difficulties of over 30 households were resolved. The method of dividing the harvest is to split the grain and fodder equally, with both families providing fertilizer, the landowner providing seeds, and bearing the public grain. (8) Land is rented out in two ways: one is cash rent, and the other is grain rent. The rent amount is agreed upon by both parties.

    Because the district solved the difficulties of impoverished households, spring plowing and sowing were carried out in a timely manner, and the masses responded well. Liu Fuhong and her son from Yangjiatuan used to have very poor production. This year, after joining the mutual aid team, the team lent them 120 jin of corn and 70 jin of dried sweet potatoes during the lean season, solving their living difficulties. They hoed their corn three more times this year than last year, and the corn is growing very well. They said everywhere: "Production is better this year, thanks to joining the mutual aid team and the mutual help of relatives and neighbors." The masses reflected: This year's help to impoverished households is very good, and the future troubles will be less, saving us from providing relief today and having to provide relief again tomorrow.

    The Third District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party gained the following insights in solving the problems of impoverished households: First, although Kunlun Third District has experienced consecutive years of bumper harvests, and agricultural production has been continuously increasing since its restoration, there are still 9% of farm households (accounting for 5% of the population) who are experiencing difficulties in production and life. This is mainly due to the characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy. Not only do farmers have different labor conditions, production technologies, and land quality, but especially because productivity is very low, they cannot withstand the torment of natural and man-made disasters. Therefore, leading agricultural production in the future must pay attention to overcoming two kinds of deviations: one is only seeing the aspects of production development and improved living standards (of course, this is fundamental), and not seeing the aspects of backward production and difficult living standards, thereby generating complacency and self-satisfaction, and not paying attention to helping solve the problems of impoverished households in leading the development of agricultural production. This will cause some farmers who were originally only having difficulties in production to sink deeper and deeper due to not receiving help and support, becoming serious disaster-stricken households. The other is a purely relief-oriented viewpoint. Some cadres do not pay attention to organizing impoverished households to engage in production for self-salvation, and when there is no relief grain, they simply report the number of impoverished households to the higher authorities. The results of this are: (1) Temporary emergency relief ultimately cannot fundamentally solve the difficulties of impoverished households; (2) It causes some impoverished households to rely on relief and not actively seek ways out of production, saying things like "Anyway, the People's Government cannot just watch people starve to death"; (3) It causes impoverished households to become detached from the masses, and the masses feel that the relief provided to impoverished households over the years is a "bottomless pit." Therefore, solving the problem of impoverished households must implement the policy of production for self-salvation as the main focus, supplemented by social relief and government support. At the same time, we cannot simply take temporary measures, but must continuously strengthen leadership in normal production throughout the year.

    Second, in solving the problem of impoverished households, we must first make impoverished households establish confidence in production for self-salvation. Some impoverished households are often resigned to fate, pessimistic, and hopeless due to their own lack of production capacity and their inability to seek social mutual assistance and mutual benefit, and avenues for production for self-salvation, and they have no confidence in production. Although some farm households have certain production conditions, they have also suffered setbacks in their enthusiasm for production and lost confidence in production due to the many difficulties in production that have not been resolved for a long time. Therefore, we must strengthen ideological leadership for them in light of various different ideological situations, so that they recognize the great future of the new China and recognize that their difficulties are temporary difficulties. On this basis, we should help them study methods of production for self-salvation and solve production and living difficulties based on actual conditions. We must overcome their negative and pessimistic emotions from the above two aspects and enhance their enthusiasm for production and self-salvation. In addition, we should pay attention to absorbing them to participate in some necessary social activities in their daily lives, so that they can be constantly educated and maintain close ties with the masses.

    Third, production for self-salvation by impoverished households can only be carried out with broad social support and government support. Therefore, we must educate the masses and mutual aid team members to adopt an attitude of love, mutual benefit, unity, and mutual assistance towards them, and should not exclude them. We must make the peasant masses recognize the significance of comprehensive production increase. Improving the production of impoverished households not only increases social wealth, but also reduces the burden on society. On the other hand, we should also conduct education on "reciprocity" for impoverished households, and take the initiative to help other families do some work within their ability, such as cleaning up threshing grounds, delivering meals, feeding pigs, grazing cattle, sewing and washing clothes, and carrying children, in order to exchange odd jobs for whole jobs and light work for heavy work. At the same time, impoverished households can only obtain constant social support by adopting an attitude of mutual assistance and mutual benefit.

    Fourth, to solve the production and living difficulties of impoverished households, we must adopt different methods according to different types: (1) For orphans and widows who have no labor power and have difficulties in both production and life, we should mainly adopt methods such as social mutual assistance and mutual benefit, and government support to achieve the goal of production for self-salvation. (2) For those who have a way to make a living but have difficulties in production, we mainly adopt methods such as hiring plowing, dividing the harvest, contracting the land, and renting the land. (3) For those who are currently in difficulty but will have a way in the future, we mainly adopt methods such as free lending, government loans, and mobilizing participation in mutual aid teams. In short, there are many ways to solve the difficulties of impoverished households. The problem lies in the leadership's constant concern, and its ability to start from actual conditions, mobilize the masses to offer ideas and find solutions. Experience has proven that the problems of any impoverished household can be gradually and appropriately solved today, with the country's financial and economic situation fundamentally improved and the production and living standards of the broad masses of people rising.

    山东昆仑县三区通过组织生产解决常年困难户的困难
    石振生
    山东省昆仑县三区农民的生产、生活水平一般的是在逐年提高。该区一九五一年每亩平均产量二百六十二斤，超过战前每亩平均产量百分之三十七；一九五二年每亩平均产量三百六十八斤，超过战前每亩平均产量百分之五十四。但仍有一部分农民生产、生活水平没有提高，甚至下降。今年春季全区发现困难户六百九十八户，共一千七百九十九人，占全区总户数的百分之九，占总人口的百分之五。这些户大都属于鳏寡孤独或有病户。他们共有土地四千五百二十亩，占全区土地总面积的百分之五，但产量很低，每亩一般产量是二百斤左右，少者一百五十斤，最低者八、九十斤，平均每亩产量比一般农民（每亩三百六十八斤）约少产一百五十斤左右。
    中共三区区委入春以来，在干部中便批判了“丰收无灾”的麻痹思想和官僚主义作风。从基点做起，着手解决困难户的生产、生活问题。对上述困难户，除有一些户需要救济款，发放了救济款两千三百余万元、救济粮三百余斤、地瓜干五千余斤、草六千余斤以外，并分别情况，采取以下几种办法，解决了困难户的生产困难。（1）用亲邻互助的办法解决了一百七十户的困难。（2）用雇牛耕种的办法解决了一百二十户的困难，价格本着合理原则，互相商酌。（3）吸收困难户参加互助组或调整一部分代管地给他代耕。这种办法解决了九十多户的困难。（4）由固定的互助组或户代为耕种，记工作价，耕种后交付工资。这种办法解决了八十多户的困难。（5）用粗细换工的办法，即有劳动力户帮助困难户耕种收获，困难户帮助有劳动力户作零活，解决了八十多户的困难。（6）用包种困难户自己不能耕种的部分土地的办法，解决了五十多户的困难。（7）用分种或出租的办法解决了三十多户的困难。分种办法是粮秣平分，两家出肥料，地户出种籽，并负担公粮。（8）土地出租，出租有两种：一种是钱租；一种是粮租。租额由双方议定。
    该区因为解决了困难户的困难，适时进行了春耕春种，群众反映良好。杨家疃刘福洪母子两人，往年生产很不好，今年参加互助组后，青黄不接时组内借给他玉米一百二十斤、地瓜干七十斤，解决了生活困难，他们把今年的玉米比去年多锄了三遍，玉米长得很好。她们到处说：“今年生产好了，多亏参加了互助组，亲邻互相帮助。”群众反映：今年对困难户这样帮助很好，往后的麻烦就少了，省得今天救济，明天还得救济。
    中共三区区委在解决困难户问题上得到以下几点体会：第一，昆仑三区虽然经过连年丰收，生产恢复以后农业生产在不断地增长，但仍有百分之九的农户（占百分之五的人口）在生产、生活方面很困难。这主要是由于小农经济的特点，农民不但劳动条件、生产技术、土地质量有所不同，特别是由于生产力很低，经不起天灾人祸的折磨。因此领导农业生产在今后较长时期内必须注意克服两种偏向：一种是只看见生产发展、生活提高的方面
  （当然这是基本的），看不见生产落后、生活困难的方面，因而产生麻痹自满情绪，在领导发展农业生产中不重视帮助解决困难户的问题。这就会使一些原来只是在生产方面有困难的农户，由于得不到帮助和扶持而愈陷愈深，变成严重的灾荒户。一种是单纯的救济观点，有些干部对困难户不注意组织他们进行生产自救，当没有救济粮的时候，就把困难户数报告上级了事。这样一来产生的结果是：
  （一）临时救急终究不能从根本上解决困难户的困难；（二）使得某些困难户依赖救济不积极从生产中找出路，说甚么“反正人民政府不能眼看着饿死人”；（三）使得困难户脱离群众，群众感到对困难户历年救济是“填不满的枯井”。因此，解决困难户的问题必须贯彻以生产自救为主，辅以社会救济和政府扶持的方针解决。同时还不能仅仅是采取临时措施，必须贯注于常年生产中不间断地加强领导。
    第二，解决困难户的问题时，必须首先使困难户确立生产自救的信心。有些困难户由于本身生产无力，又不善于寻求社会互助互济、生产自救的门路，因而常常是听天由命，悲观失望，对生产无信心。有些农户虽有一定的生产条件，但由于生产时困难很多，长时期得不到解决，也使生产积极性遭受挫折，丧失生产信心。因此，必须针对各种不同思想情况加强对他们的思想领导，使他们认识新中国的伟大前途，认识自己的困难是一时的困难。在这一基础上，根据实际情况帮助他们研究生产自救办法，解决生产、生活困难。从上述两方面克服他们的消极悲观情绪，提高生产自救的积极性。另外在日常生活中应注意吸收他们参加一些必要的社会活动，使之经常受到教育，密切和群众的关系。
    第三，困难户生产自救，必须有广泛的社会支援和政府扶持才有可能进行。因此，必须教育群众和互助组员对他们要采取友爱互济、团结互助的态度，不应排挤他们。必须使农民群众认识全面增产的意义，困难户生产好了，不但增加了社会财富，也减少了社会的负担。另一方面也应对困难户进行
  “礼尚往来”的教育，在力所能及的情况下主动帮助别人家作一些力所能及的活，例如：收拾场园、送饭、喂猪、放牛、缝洗衣服、抱小孩等，以零工换整工，以轻活换重活。同时，困难户也只有抱着互助互济的态度，才能获得社会上的经常支援。
    第四，解决困难户的生产、生活困难，必须分别类型采用不同办法：（一）对无劳动力以及生产、生活上都有困难的孤寡户，主要应采取社会互助互济、政府扶持等办法，达到生产自救的目的。
  （二）对生活上有办法，生产上有困难者主要采取雇耕、分种、包种、租种等办法解决。（三）目前有困难，将来有办法者，主要采取自由借贷、政府贷款、动员参加互助组等办法解决。总之，解决困难户的困难的办法很多，问题在于领导上经常关怀，善于从实际情况出发，发动群众出主意、想办法。经验证明，任何困难户的问题，在今天国家财政经济情况已根本好转、广大人民生产、生活上升的情况下，都是可以逐步地适当地解决的。
