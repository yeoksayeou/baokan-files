Agricultural Science Serving Agricultural Production
——On the Research Work of the North China Agricultural Research Institute
Ye Duzhuang

In order to help farmers improve production through science and technology, the People's Government has established many agricultural scientific research institutions throughout the country, one of which is the North China Agricultural Research Institute.

What has the North China Agricultural Research Institute done for the farmers? What relationship does it have with the farmers?

Let's start with "666." Everyone knows that this is an insecticide used in agricultural production. Before 1951, we couldn't manufacture this insecticide; if we wanted to use it, we had to buy it from foreign countries. In 1949, the Central Ministry of Agriculture gave the North China Agricultural Research Institute a task: to research the manufacturing method of "666." After many experiments, the manufacturing method was finally researched in 1950.

The "666" manufactured with domestic raw materials is cheaper than imported goods. 0.5 kg of "666" powder is equivalent to about 3 kg of millet, while imported goods used to be equivalent to about 8 kg of millet per kg. This creates favorable conditions for the prevention and control of agricultural pests. In the past, we relied entirely on manpower to catch locusts, but now we have the conditions to eliminate locusts with pesticides and machinery.

With "666," the next issue is its use; different methods of use must be studied for different pests in different environments. For example, for locusts, the Locust Group of the Plant Protection Department of the North China Agricultural Research Institute clearly proposed the poisoned bait method in 1950, and it was used extensively in Jinghai, Hebei, and other places in 1951. In 1952, the mixing ratio of the poisoned bait was clarified as 2.5 kg of "666" powder, 100 kg of wheat bran, and 100 kg of water, and it was applied on a large area of 800,000 mu in 21 counties in Hebei, Shandong, and the former Pingyuan provinces. The area of poisoned bait application increased significantly again in 1953. Applying poisoned bait can not only save pesticides but also save labor. For example, in 1952, the eighth district of Wudi County, Shandong Province, used poisoned bait to control locusts on an area of 20,463 mu, using a total of 1,016 labor days, with each labor day able to control 20 mu. The powder spraying method was used to control 12,450 mu, using a total of 1,380 labor days, with each labor day only controlling 9 mu. As for manual catching, each labor day can only catch locust nymphs on a fraction of a mu. If we calculate 5 workers per mu of locust nymphs, then poisoned bait can save 99% of the labor compared to manual catching.

In areas with severe soil locusts, protecting wheat seedlings has become a serious problem. For example, in Huimin Prefecture, Shandong, wheat is generally sown around the Autumn Equinox. Due to the severe damage caused by soil locusts, many wheat seedlings are eaten, and the masses have to replant wheat more than three times. Some are forced to delay the wheat sowing period to around the Frost's Descent, but late sowing will encounter the harm of bunt disease (black wheat), so some farmers dare not plant wheat. Before the government promoted the poisoned bait method, the masses used a small wooden stick with a shoe sole nailed to it to hit locusts, which was very inefficient. But after using the poisoned bait method, the situation changed greatly. The masses near the wasteland of Wudi and Zanhua, who had never dared to sow wheat in time in previous years, said: "We are no longer afraid of locust plagues. We have a way to deal with them, and we can grow more wheat!" Zhang Yuwen from the fourth district of Leling County, Shandong, recalled the locust plague of 1942: at that time, the crops were eaten up, forcing him to go far away, and his two younger sisters were also given to others as child brides. This year, when the government distributed medicine to control locusts, he excitedly said: "Chairman Mao and the Communist Party are really life-saving benefactors!"

Of course, simply applying the poisoned bait method cannot completely solve the locust problem. Preparation work and reconnaissance work must also be carried out. These are the basic links in locust control. According to the locust control experience over the years and referring to the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, the Locust Group of the North China Agricultural Research Institute proposed a systematic reconnaissance system in 1952. At the same time, it also developed a horse-drawn locust catcher to catch locusts on large areas of grassland, solving the difficulty of using medicine or the uneconomical use of medicine in these areas.

In addition, in locust control work, our country has begun to use airplanes with emphasis. With the development of socialist industrialization, other methods such as power spraying and power baiting will be gradually researched and applied.

In terms of other agricultural pests, the Plant Protection Department of the North China Agricultural Research Institute has researched methods such as using "666" poisoned bait, poisoned grains, and seed dressing to control underground pests—wireworms, mole crickets, and grubs—and these methods have been widely used throughout the country. This has played a significant role in protecting wheat seedlings. At the same time, in 1950, it first proposed the method of spraying medicine into the heart of the leaves (喇叭口 - trumpet mouth) to control corn borers (钻心虫 - heart-drilling insects), which was later improved in various places and achieved even greater results.

Cattle plague has been a problem that has plagued farmers for many years. Cattle plague has been prevalent in our country for many years, and the Kuomintang reactionary government did nothing about it. For example, in 1937, more than 34,000 cattle died of cattle plague in northern Sichuan. When Beijing was liberated in 1949, cattle plague occurred in the former Chaharbei area. The People's Government immediately sent technical personnel from the former Animal Epidemic Prevention Department of the North China Agricultural Research Institute to cooperate with the local government to carry out prevention and control, and began to advocate the large-scale use of cattle plague rabbit-attenuated vaccine, putting out the cattle plague. Since then, this vaccine has been widely used in North China, Northeast China, Northwest China, Inner Mongolia, and other places to give cattle preventive injections. Now, it can be said that cattle plague has been controlled throughout the country, and farmers no longer have to worry about this terrible disease when raising cattle. This vaccine is not only effective but also economical (one rabbit can produce vaccine for 300 cattle); and after one preventive injection, cattle will not get cattle plague again within a year. If preventive injections are given to cattle continuously for several years in an area, cattle plague can basically be eliminated.

Bovine emphysema is also a very severe infectious disease. The Animal Epidemic Prevention Department of the North China Agricultural Research Institute has produced emphysema vaccine and carried out mass production, supplying it to Inner Mongolia, North China, East China, and even Hainan Island for application (each injection only costs several hundred yuan). Anthrax is a serious epidemic disease that infects cattle, horses, donkeys, mules, and sheep. Before liberation, countless livestock died from this disease. The department produced a large number of vaccines and serums to supply to North China, Inner Mongolia, and other places for use (each injection only costs several hundred yuan). After several years of preventive injections after liberation, the above two kinds of livestock diseases have been basically controlled.

Newcastle disease (鸡瘟 - chicken plague) is a chicken infectious disease that everyone is familiar with. Whenever this disease is prevalent, it can even cause all the chickens in a village to die. The Animal Epidemic Prevention Department has researched a vaccine that can prevent chicken plague by simply pricking the chicken's wing with a pen tip or dropping a drop in the eye. In 1951, Hebei Province used this vaccine to immunize more than one million chickens. This is of great benefit to rural sideline production.

Peanut rhizobia is a bacterial fertilizer well known to farmers who grow peanuts. If five qian of this fertilizer is used per mu (costing only three or four hundred yuan), peanut production can generally be increased by 20 to 30 jin. In 1950, it was demonstrated and promoted on 53,000 mu of land, with good results and was welcomed by the masses. This year, the area of use has reached 620,000 mu.

In terms of tomatoes (西红柿), the Horticulture Department of the North China Agricultural Research Institute has introduced 13 varieties to farmers in the suburbs of Beijing (these varieties were selected from more than 200 varieties). Liu Jinglin of Taipingqiao Village, Fengtai District, tried to plant pink tomato "No. 79" (mid-season variety) in 1951 and has maintained this variety until this year. According to a survey this summer, under similar cultivation management conditions, the yield of other mid-season pink tomato varieties is about 11,760 to 13,600 jin per mu, while the yield of "No. 79" is about 14,560 jin; if each jin is calculated at 200 yuan, "No. 79" can earn 192,000 to 560,000 yuan more per mu. The new hybrid sweet potato varieties bred include "No. 117," "No. 166," and "No. 284," which have excellent characteristics and can be promoted.

In order to better meet objective needs and closely integrate agricultural science with agricultural production, at the beginning of this year, under the leadership of Chen Fengtong, director of the North China Agricultural Research Institute, two agricultural science vanguard teams were formed, including agricultural science workers from the crop, soil, fertilizer, and pest and disease departments. They entered the central part of Hebei Province and the Fen River Basin of Shanxi Province, respectively, and formed several comprehensive investigation and research groups together with local agricultural technicians to go deep into rural areas. In Hebei Province, a total of 23 wheat research base points and 13 cotton research base points were established. In Shanxi Province, six local work groups were also set up, and base point work was established in 27 villages in 10 counties in the three prefectures of Linfen, Yuncheng, and Yuci. In addition to the above-mentioned wheat and cotton rural work groups, the institute also organized livestock work groups, pasture work groups, and horticulture work groups. The main characteristics of these work groups are: on the one hand, they are regional; on the other hand, they are comprehensive. Their mission is to improve theoretical research by solving practical problems; to sort out farmers' production experience and research and solve current agricultural production problems; and to create conditions for the huge scientific work required during the period of collectivization, mechanization, and crop rotation systems in the future. The work over the past year has proved that doing so can not only connect agricultural scientific workers with farmers, but also enable farmers to acquire agricultural scientific knowledge.

Since liberation, the Party and the government have helped farmers improve production in all aspects. The help of science and technology is only a part of it, and the work of the North China Agricultural Research Institute is only a small part of the agricultural science and technology work. However, the main target of our country's agricultural scientific research work is still the small-scale peasant economy. This backward small-scale peasant economy cannot use machines, tractors, and large-scale farmland water conservancy, nor can it fully utilize the achievements of agricultural science and advanced technology. Therefore, agricultural scientific workers eagerly look forward to the early completion of our country's socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization, because only in this way can agricultural science serve agricultural production more effectively, and only in this way can the development of agricultural science obtain more reliable conditions.

    为农业生产服务的农业科学
    ——记华北农业科学研究所的研究工作
    叶笃庄
    为了从科学技术上帮助农民提高生产，人民政府在全国范围内设立了许多农业科学研究机构，华北农业科学研究所便是其中的一个。
    华北农业科学研究所给农民作了一些什么事呢？和农民有些什么关系呢？
      首先谈谈“六六六”吧。大家都知道，这是农业生产上的一种杀虫药剂。在一九五一年以前，我们还不会制造这种药剂，要想用，只好向外国买。一九四九年中央农业部给予了华北农业科学研究所一项任务：研究“六六六”的制造方法。经过多次的试验，终于在一九五○年把它的制造方法研究出来了。
    用国产原料所制造的“六六六”，价格比进口货便宜，零点五“六六六”粉剂每斤约合小米三斤，而过去的进口货每斤约合小米八斤。这就为农业害虫的防治工作创造了有利的条件。过去我们完全依靠人力来捕打蝗虫，现在我们则有条件以药械来消灭蝗虫了。
    有了“六六六”，紧跟着来的就是使用问题；对于不同环境中的不同害虫，必须研究出不同的使用方法。例如对于蝗虫，华北农业科学研究所植物保护系蝗虫组在一九五○年就明确提出毒饵的方法，一九五一年在河北静海等地大量使用；一九五二年明确了毒饵的配合量为二点五“六六六”粉二市斤，麦麸一百市斤，水一百市斤，并在河北、山东、原平原等三省二十一个县八十万亩的大面积上施用；一九五三年施用毒饵的面积又大有增加。施用毒饵不仅可以节省药剂，而且可以节省劳动力。例如，一九五二年山东省无棣县第八区施用毒饵治蝗面积为二万零四百六十三亩，共用一千零十六个日工，每工可以防治二十亩；用喷粉法治了一万二千四百五十亩，共用一千三百八十个日工，每工仅防治九亩。至于人工捕打，每个工仅能打几分地的蝗蝻。如以五个人工打一亩蝗蝻计，则毒饵可以比人工捕打节省百分之九十九的劳动力。
    在土蝗严重的地区，小麦保苗成了严重的问题。例如山东惠民专区，一般在秋分时播种小麦，因土蝗为害严重，麦苗多被吃掉，群众连续补种小麦有达三次以上的，有的被迫把小麦播种期延迟到霜降前后，而播种期晚，又会碰到腥黑穗病（乌麦）的为害，因此有些农民不敢种小麦了。在政府推广毒饵法以前，群众都用一根小木棍在上面钉一鞋底，来打蝗虫，效率是很低的。但是使用毒饵法之后，情形就有很大的改变了。无棣、沾化草荒附近历年不敢及时种麦的群众都说：“今后再也不怕蝗害了，我们有办法对付它，并且还能够多种麦子哩！”山东乐陵县四区张玉温想到一九四二年的蝗害：那时庄稼被吃光了，逼得出远门，两个妹妹也给人家做了童养媳。今年政府发药治蝗时，他兴奋地说：“毛主席、共产党真是救命恩人！”
    当然，单纯施用毒饵法并不能完全解决蝗虫问题，还必须进行准备工作和侦查工作，这是防治蝗虫的基本环节。华北农业科学研究所蝗虫组根据历年来的治蝗经验，并参照苏联的先进经验，在一九五二年提出了一套有系统的侦查制度。同时，还研究出一种马拉捕蝗器，来捕捉大面积草原上的蝗虫，解决了这些地区不适于用药或用药不经济的困难。
    此外，在治蝗工作上，我们国家已开始有重点地使用飞机；随着社会主义工业化的发展，其他如动力喷粉、动力撒饵，都会逐渐地研究出来而加以应用的。
    在其他农业害虫方面，华北农业科学研究所植物保护系研究出用“六六六”毒饵、毒谷、拌种等方法来防治地下害虫—金针虫、蝼蛄、蛴螬，并在全国各地广泛应用。这对于小麦保苗起了很大的作用。同时在一九五○年最先提出了用向叶心（喇叭口）喷药方法来防治玉米螟（钻心虫），后经各地改进，收到了更大的效果。
    关于牛瘟，是农民多年来最头疼的问题。牛瘟在我国流行了很多年，国民党反动政府是不闻不问的。举个例子来说，一九三七年在川北因牛瘟就死去三万四千多头牛。一九四九年北京解放的时候，原察北地区发生了牛瘟，人民政府立刻派华北农业科学研究所原家畜防疫系的技术人员前往配合地方政府进行防治，并开始提倡大量使用牛瘟兔化疫苗，把牛瘟扑灭了。此后在华北、东北、西北、内蒙等地普遍利用了这种疫苗，给牛只进行预防注射。现在，可以说全国各地的牛瘟已经控制，农民养牛，再也不必担心这种可怕的疾病了。这种疫苗不但有效，而且经济（用一只兔子就能制出供三百头牛用的疫苗）；并且经预防注射一次后，一年内决不会再得牛瘟，假如在一个地区对牛只连续进行预防注射几年，基本上就可以消灭牛瘟。
    牛的气肿疽病也是一种很厉害的传染病。华北农业科学研究所家畜防疫系曾制成了气肿疽疫苗，并进行大量生产，供应内蒙、华北、华东，以至海南岛等地应用（每注射一次只需数百元）。炭疽病是牛、马、驴、骡、羊都受传染的一种严重的疫病，解放前因这种病死去的牲口不计其数，该系曾大量制造这种疫苗和血清供应华北、内蒙等地使用（每注射一次只需数百元）。解放后经过几年的预防注射，上述二种牲口病已基本可以控制了。
    亚洲鸡瘟（鸡瘟）是大家很熟悉的一种鸡的传染病，每逢这种病流行时，甚至可以使一个村子的鸡统统死光的。家畜防疫系研究出一种疫苗，只要把这种疫苗用钢笔尖在鸡的翅膀下刺一下或在眼睛里滴一滴，就可以避免鸡瘟。河北省在一九五一年曾用这种疫苗免疫了一百多万只鸡。这对农村副业生产有很大的好处。
    花生根瘤菌是种花生的农民所熟知的一种细菌肥料。如果每亩用上五钱此种肥料（只需三、四百元），一般可增产花生二十至三十斤。一九五○年曾在五万三千亩的土地上示范推广，效果良好，受到群众的欢迎。今年的使用面积，已达到六十二万亩了。
    在蕃茄（西红柿）方面，华北农业科学研究所园艺系曾先后向北京郊区农民介绍了十三个品种（这些品种是从二百多个品种选育出来的）。丰台区太平桥村刘景林在一九五一年试种粉红蕃茄“七九号”
  （中熟种），并一直把这个品种保持到今年。据今夏调查，在相近的栽培管理情况下，其他粉红蕃茄中熟种蕃茄每亩产量约为一万一千七百六十到一万三千六百斤，而“七九号”的产量约为一万四千五百六十斤；如每斤按二百元计算，“七九号”每亩可多收入十九万二千元到五十六万元。在甘薯方面育成的新杂交种有“一一七号”，“一六六号”、“二八四号”等，性状优良，已可推广。
    为了更好地满足客观的需要，使农业科学和农业生产密切结合起来，今年初在华北农业科学研究所所长陈凤桐率领下，组成了两支农业科学先遣部队，其中包括作物、土壤、肥料、病虫害等部门的农业科学工作者，先后进入河北省的中部和山西省的汾河流域，与当地的农业技术人员共同组成若干综合性的调查研究小组，深入农村工作，在河北省共建立了二十三个小麦研究基点，十三个棉花研究基点；在山西省也设立了六个地方工作组，分别在临汾、运城、榆次三个专区十个县二十七个村庄建立了基点工作。除了上述的麦棉农村工作组外，该所还组织了畜牧工作组、牧草工作组以及园艺工作组。这些工作组的主要特点是：一方面是区域性的，另方面是综合性的。它们的任务在于通过实际问题的解决来提高理论的研究；整理农民的生产经验和研究、解决当前农业生产的问题，同时为将来合作化、机械化、草田轮作制时期所需要的巨大科学工作创造条件。一年来的工作证明了，这样做下去，不但可使农业科学工作者和农民联系起来，而且也可使农民取得农业科学知识。
    解放以来，党和政府在各方面帮助农民提高了生产，科学技术的帮助只是其中的一部分，而华北农业科学研究所的工作又仅仅是农业科学技术工作中的一小部分。但是，目前我国农业科学研究工作的主要对象，究竟还是小农经济。这种落后的小农经济既不能使用机器、拖拉机和利用大规模的农田水利，也不能充分利用农业科学的成就和先进技术。所以农业科学工作者热烈盼望我国的社会主义工业化和农业的合作化的早日完成，因为只有这样，农业科学才能更有效地为农业生产服务，也只有这样，农业科学的发展才能获得更可靠的条件。
