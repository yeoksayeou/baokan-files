    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, December 5th: The Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party submitted a proposal to various Japanese trade union organizations and people's organizations on November 18th, calling on them to unite and take joint action to oppose the conspiracy of the US and Japanese reactionaries to rearm Japan and overthrow the Yoshida government.
    The proposal pointed out that the joint communique issued by Yoshida's special envoy, Hayato Ikeda, and the US Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, Robertson, regarding Japan's rearmament, shows that the Yoshida government has succumbed to the United States and reached a basic consensus with the United States on the issue of rearmament. The proposal further pointed out that the road of accepting the "assistance" of the US Mutual Security Agency is a road towards war and national subjugation. It will prolong the US occupation of Japan, strengthen US aggressive deployments, strengthen the fascist suppression of the Japanese people, comprehensively implement the militarization of Japanese industry, fundamentally undermine the lives of the Japanese people, and trample on the human rights of the Japanese people.
    While pointing out that the Yoshida government is disregarding the Diet in the negotiations for concluding a "Mutual Security Assistance Agreement" with the United States, the proposal emphasized that the Yoshida government is now undermining Japan's peaceful constitution and is colluding with the Reform Party and Hatoyama Liberal Party in an attempt to muddle through the 18th Extraordinary Diet session. The proposal concluded by saying that the Japanese Communist Party calls on the people of the whole country to closely unite, oppose the Ikeda-Robertson Joint Communique, oppose the Yoshida government's acceptance of "assistance" from the US Mutual Security Agency, and participate in joint action to overthrow the Yoshida government, in order to investigate the Yoshida government's responsibility for deceiving the people and carrying out rearmament, and to safeguard democracy, freedom, and the people's livelihood.

    日共向各工会组织和人民团体提出建议书
    号召共同行动反对重新武装日本的阴谋
    【新华社五日讯】东京消息：日本共产党中央指导部于十一月十八日向日本各工会组织和人民团体提出建议书，号召它们团结起来，为反对美、日反动派重新武装日本的阴谋采取共同行动，打倒吉田政府。
    建议书指出：吉田的特使池田勇人和美国负责远东事务的助理国务卿罗伯逊关于日本重整军备的联合公报说明，吉田政府已屈服于美国，在重整军备问题上和美国取得了基本上一致的意见。建议书进一步指出：接受美国共同安全署“援助”的道路，就是走向战争和亡国的道路。它将延长美国对日本的占领，加强美国的侵略部署，加强对日本人民的法西斯镇压，全面执行日本产业军事化，从根本上破坏日本人民的生活和蹂躏日本人民的人权。
    建议书在指出吉田政府在和美国缔结“共同安全援助协定”的谈判中蔑视国会时强调说：现在，吉田政府正在破坏着日本的和平宪法，并在勾结改进党和鸠山自由党，企图混过第十八届临时国会会议。建议书最后说：日本共产党号召全国人民，为了追究吉田政府欺瞒人民进行重整军备的责任，为了维护民主、自由和人民生活，要紧密地团结起来，反对池田—罗伯逊联合公报，反对吉田政府接受美国共同安全署“援助”，参加打倒吉田政府的共同行动。
