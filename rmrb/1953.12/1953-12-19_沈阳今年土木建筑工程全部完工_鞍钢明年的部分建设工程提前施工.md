Shenyang Completes All Civil Engineering and Construction Projects This Year
Anshan Iron and Steel Complex Brings Forward Some Construction Projects for Next Year

    In the first year of the nation's First Five-Year Plan, the employees of the Shenyang municipal capital construction departments, under the leadership of the Party and the government, with the enthusiastic and selfless assistance of Soviet experts and the cooperation and support from all sides, achieved brilliant accomplishments. As of December 5th, they had completed 1,160,000 square meters of civil engineering and construction tasks according to plan. The additional 70,000+ square meters of projects will also be completed in mid-December, ensuring that no project will carry over into the new year.

    Shenyang had a heavy capital construction task this year. Not only was the workload much larger than in previous years, but industrial capital construction accounted for a large proportion. Key projects such as the First Machine Tool Plant, the Pneumatic Tool Plant, and the Shenyang Electric Wire Plant also began their first year of construction this year. After a year of hard work, the city's capital construction workers have ensured the completion of this year's national plan, especially the completion of key projects. Now, modern factory buildings have emerged on the ground, and various new machines from the Soviet Union, other People's Democratic countries, and our own country are being installed inside. Some have already been installed and put into production, producing various industrial products to meet the needs of various regions. In the newly built classrooms, laboratories, and practice factories, thousands of young students are studying various scientific knowledge to build their motherland. People have already moved into the newly erected dormitory buildings. The beautiful sports palace, clubs, and cinemas will also be opened soon. As the country enters a new period of planned construction, Shenyang appears even more magnificent. The city's capital construction workers are now beginning to prepare for next year's construction to ensure the full completion of the 1954 national plan.

    Anshan Iron and Steel Complex has begun early construction on some projects scheduled for next year that can be started now. The renovation project for blast furnaces No. 5 and No. 6 is now underway, deepening the furnace bottoms of the iron-smelting furnaces, raising the tops of the hot-blast stoves, and demolishing and re-bricking the old refractory bricks of the two iron-smelting furnaces and hot-blast stoves. Currently, a lift more than 40 meters high has been erected on the construction site of blast furnaces No. 5 and No. 6, transporting refractory bricks and mixing refractory mud for the bricklayers who are building the hot-blast stoves. Inside the hot-blast stoves, the bricklayers from the Furnace Construction Company are dismantling the old refractory bricks. To supply refractory bricks for blast furnaces No. 5 and No. 6, the Furnace Construction Company's processing plant has gathered more than 50 people to grind refractory bricks of various shapes next to blast furnaces No. 5 and No. 6. Near the iron-smelting furnaces of blast furnaces No. 5 and No. 6, the workers of the civil engineering team of the Blast Furnace Engineering Company have already built sheds with straw mats to prepare for blasting the old foundations. Workers at the construction site of the Second Steel Plant are busy clearing scrap steel, and the drivers of the truck cranes are busy lifting the scrap steel onto flatbed trucks every day, and then transporting it to the scrap iron plant. Workers from the Furnace Construction Company's engineering team removed most of the old refractory bricks inside the soaking furnace.

    The foundation projects for the dormitories in Dagushan and Taiping Village are under construction. The woodworking factory has produced a large number of doors and windows for these dormitory projects. The secondary recovery system project of the Chemical Plant will also begin cleaning soon.

    Winter construction methods are adopted for projects started in advance. This can reduce idleness in winter and accelerate the progress of construction.

    沈阳今年土木建筑工程全部完工
    鞍钢明年的部分建设工程提前施工
    在祖国开始五年建设计划的第一年里，沈阳市基本建设部门的职工，在党和政府的领导下，在苏联专家热诚无私的帮助以及各方面的配合与支援下，获得了光辉的成就。截至十二月五日止，已按计划完成全市一百一十六万余平方公尺的土木建筑工程任务，后追加的七万多平方公尺工程也都能在十二月中旬先后竣工，可以保证全年没有一个跨年度的工程。　　沈阳市今年的基本建设任务很繁重，不仅工程量较往年增大了很多，而且工业基本建设占了很大比重，其中的第一机床厂、风动工具厂、沈阳电线厂等重要工程，也都在今年开始了第一年度的施工。全市基本建设职工经过一年来的艰苦奋斗，保证了今年国家计划的完成，特别是重点工程的完成。现在，在平地上出现了一座座现代化的工厂场房，里面正在安装来自苏联和各人民民主国家及我国自己制造的各种新式机器，有的已经安装完毕投入生产，生产出来许多种工业产品供应各地需要；在新建的教室、试验室和实习工厂中，成千上万的青年学生们正在钻研他们建设祖国的各种科学知识；在一幢幢新耸立起来的宿舍大楼中，已经有人搬了进去；美丽的体育宫、俱乐部、电影院不久也将开放。在国家进入有计划建设新时期里，沈阳市显得更加雄伟。全市基本建设职工现正开始进行明年的施工准备，以保证全面完成一九五四年的国家计划。鞍钢明年施工的工程，今年有条件施工的，现已开始提前施工。改建五、六号高炉工程，现在正在进行炼铁炉底加深、热风炉顶加高，和拆除两座炼铁炉和热风炉的旧耐火砖并重新砌砖的工作。现在，在五、六号高炉工地上，已竖立起来四十多公尺高的升降机，给热风炉砌砖的瓦工输送耐火砖和搅拌耐火泥。在热风炉里面，筑炉公司的瓦工们正在紧张地拆除旧耐火砖。为供给五、六号高炉耐火砖，筑炉公司加工厂集结了五十多人在五、六号高炉旁边磨制着各种形状的耐火砖。在五、六号高炉的炼铁炉附近，高炉工程公司土建工程队的工人早已用草垫子搭起了棚子，准备爆破旧基础。第二制钢厂工地的工人在紧张地清除废钢材，汽车式吊车的司机每天在忙碌着把废钢材吊到大板车上，然后运到碎铁厂。筑炉公司工程队工人把已拆掉了均热炉内的大部旧耐火砖清除出去。　　大孤山、太平村的宿舍基础工程正在施工。木工厂为这些宿舍工程制出了大量的门窗。化工总厂二回收系统工程也即将开始清扫。　　提前施工的工程，都采取冬季施工法。这样可以减少冬季窝工，加速建设进度。
