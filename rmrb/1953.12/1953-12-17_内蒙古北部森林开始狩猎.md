    The hunting season has begun in the forests of the Greater Khingan Mountains in northern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The Oroqen hunters, who have lived here for generations, have been setting out from the forests along the banks of the Namin River, Gan River, and Bira River since mid-November, with their "Bieladanke" guns, hunting dogs, horses, and ample food supplies. Many hunters have organized hunting mutual aid teams and established hunting plans. Currently, it is the season for hunting squirrels, lynx, and foxes. The mutual aid team in Naming Guolu (village), led by hunter Shan Bu, plans to hunt 1,700 squirrels and 30 muskrats this year. In less than half a month of hunting, they have already bagged over 200 squirrels. Hunter An Zhong from Tuogao Lu and his two partners bagged 100 squirrels in ten days. After selling their first batch of prey to the cooperative, they bought a large quantity of high-quality and inexpensive supplies.

    内蒙古北部森林开始狩猎
    在内蒙古自治区北部大兴安岭森林中，已经开始了狩猎的季节。世居在这里的鄂伦春族猎手们，带着他们的“别拉弹克”枪、猎犬、马匹和充足的食粮，从十一月中旬开始沿着纳敏河、甘河、毕拉河两岸的森林出动。很多猎民组织打猎互助组，并订立了打猎的计划。目前，正是打灰鼠、猞猁、狐的季节。纳敏郭鲁（村）由猎民单布领导的互助组，计划今年打灰鼠一千七百只、香鼠三十只。他们出动不到半个月，就已经打了二百多只灰鼠。托高鲁猎手安中和他两个伙伴十天内打了一百只灰鼠，他们把第一批获猎物带到合作社出售后，买了大批物美价廉的物资。
