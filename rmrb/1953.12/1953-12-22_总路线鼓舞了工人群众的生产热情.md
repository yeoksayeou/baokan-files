The General Line Inspires the Production Enthusiasm of the Working Masses

	Actively Produce to Support Heavy Industry
	Huaibei Salt Field　Wang Tongzhao

	After studying the General Line and seeing Anshan Iron and Steel on film, I understood the importance of developing heavy industry. At first, I thought that developing heavy industry definitely meant developing our salt industry. Aren't we always carrying burdens on our shoulders, doing strenuous work? Isn't that heavy industry? But after seeing Anshan Iron and Steel in the film, I was shocked. I didn't understand any of those machines, they were spinning before my eyes. That red-hot steel coming out of the furnace, like a fire dragon climbing from one section to the other, and then being manufactured into various machines. Only then did I understand that this kind of industry that produces the means of production is heavy industry. In the future, our salt field will be mechanized, but without heavy industry, we won't have anywhere to get the machines. If we want the salt field to be mechanized, we need a lot of steel. Therefore, we must work hard and actively support the construction of heavy industry.
	I am a member of the Communist Youth League. I want to learn technology and culture. Without culture and technology, we won't be able to use complex machines when we get to socialism. I have already signed a "master-apprentice contract" with the tide flat leader Zhao Kaiyu, asking him to teach me how to sweep niter.

	We Bear a Great Responsibility
	Gaochun County Cangxi Town Shop Assistant　Wu Jingfu

	I am a shop assistant in a private store.
	I used to think that shop assistants in private enterprises probably had no future. When we get to socialist society, the private capitalist economy will no longer exist, so where will we go? At the same time, we can't play a role in national construction, being busy serving the capitalists all day long. Therefore, I felt like I was groping in the dark with my eyes open.
	But after studying the General Line, I clarified that our task now is to ensure the continuous growth of the socialist economic components. We should supervise the capitalists to actively engage in undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, not repeat the five evils, quickly complete the payment of taxes, not steal or leak, and urge and help private industry and commerce to carry out socialist transformation.

	I am at Ease in My Work
	East China Textile Fiber Inspection Bureau　Chang Bin

	I do the work of taking cotton samples. Every day I go to the warehouse to take the cotton samples back and give them to the inspection comrades, and that's my task completed. I did it for a few days, and I thought to myself: Is this really "economic construction work"? Why don't they send me to a factory?
	Since listening to the report on the General Line and General Task, I realized that participating in the country's economic construction does not necessarily mean being in a factory. No matter what work we do, we can contribute our part to the cause of building a socialist society.
	Fiber inspection plays an important role in providing the textile industry with raw materials of excellent quality. Although I only do the work of taking cotton samples, as long as I can do this specific work conscientiously and responsibly, so that the inspection comrades can carry out their work smoothly, I am also exerting my strength in the socialist construction cause.

	I Shouldn't Have Taken My Surplus Money to Hoard Wheat
	Jiaozuo Lifeng Mine Worker　Xu Luan

	I am a seventh-grade "old digger" at the Jiaozuo Lifeng Mine. In the past few years since liberation, I have saved a lot of money by living frugally. How to deal with the savings? Whenever I had free time, I would consider this matter. Loan it out, or buy land, or invest it in a private store to do business; but then I thought, no, the working class can't exploit people! I can't do that, but what should I do with the remaining money? After thinking about it, I bought 700,000 yuan worth of wheat and stored it.
	Not long after that, my father-in-law came. When he saw me, he said, "You should still buy some houses and land, land is the root! You'll have something to rely on when you get old." When I heard this, I thought it made sense, so in June of this year, I bought a piece of land and planned to buy some bricks, tiles, and beams to build a house. In October, my father-in-law said that the cotton gin was good and made a lot of money, so I bought one. Recently, I discussed it with my brother and prepared to buy two more strings of dilapidated courtyard houses in Ningguo Village.
	Some time ago, the deputy secretary of the mine's Party committee reported to us on the General Line and General Task of the country during the transition period, and then let us conduct discussions and studies. This time, I realized that my past idea of hoarding wheat and wanting to acquire property was wrong. I should deposit the saved money in the bank to accumulate funds for the country to build our motherland. If the country is socialist industrialized, will I still suffer? Buying a cotton gin, hoarding wheat, and doing business are developing on the capitalist road. The result of this will be to separate me from the factory, not be a worker, and even become a capitalist. Looking back, it is so dangerous! The country's General Line has illuminated the path for me to move forward. I will sell the five *shi* of wheat stored at home to the state and deposit the remaining money in the bank to accumulate funds for the country.

	I Want to Cultivate More Technicians for the Country
	Tianjin Tram Company Technician　Liu Qiying

	I have lived for sixty years. In the old society, I suffered a lot. I had to pour tea and hand over cigarettes to please my master before I could learn a little skill. After liberation, the leadership promoted me and made me a team leader, and helped me modify and create more than 20 kinds of machines and tools. I was also selected as a model worker. Because I had suffered enough from not being able to learn technology in the old society, I am now determined to make the technology public and teach apprentices. After listening to the report on the General Line of the country during the transition period, I realized the importance of training apprentices even more: the faster we train more technicians for the country, the faster our country will transition to a socialist society!

	Complete the National Production Plan Ahead of Schedule and Exceed the Quota
	Tianjin Special-Class Labor Model　Liu Changfu

	Before listening to the report on the General Line of the country during the transition period, many workers felt that socialist society was coming anyway, so let's just follow along. After hearing the report, I realized that just following along is not enough. The amount of effort we put in today has a great relationship with the arrival of socialist society. I myself also realized from the ideological point of view that the better I do my work today, the better I do it, and completing the 1953 plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota is laying the foundation for next year's construction, and that is laying a brick for advancing towards a socialist society. Speaking of completing the national construction plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota, in the past, after each competition, the enthusiasm for the competition often could not be consolidated. Once the competition was over, production slackened. Through this discussion of the General Line, everyone realized the shortcomings of the past competitions, and realized that it is necessary to regard completing the plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota as a regular task. Only when workers regularly complete and exceed the national plan can our country steadily transition to a socialist society.

### 总路线鼓舞了工人群众的生产热情

    总路线鼓舞了工人群众的生产热情
    积极生产支援重工业
    淮北盐场　王同照
    我学习了总路线，在电影上看到了鞍钢，懂得了发展重工业的重要性。起先我认为发展重工业，一定要发展咱们的盐业，咱们成天扁担不离肩，做些吃力的活，还不算重工业吗？当我从电影上看到鞍钢的情形，把我吓了一跳，那些机器我一点也不懂，机器转的眼花。那些从炉里出来的通红的钢铁，像个火龙似的从这段爬到那段，然后又被制造成为各种机器。心里才懂得像这种制造生产资料的工业才是个重工业哩。将来我们盐场要机械化，没有重工业，咱们机器就没处来，要想盐场机械化，必须要有大量的钢铁才能办到。因此，我们要努力生产，积极支援重工业建设。
    我是一个青年团员，我要学习技术，学习文化。没有文化和技术，到社会主义就不能使用复杂的机器。我已和领滩手赵开雨，订了“师徒合同”，请他教我扫硝。
    我们负担着重大责任
    高淳县沧溪镇店员　吴景福
    我是私营商店的一个店员。
    以前我认为私营企业中的店员大概没有什么出路。到了社会主义社会，私人资本主义经济不存在了，我们到那里去呢？同时我们对国家建设也起不了什么作用，成天忙着为资方服务，因此觉得自己是在睁着眼睛摸黑路。
    但这次学习总路线后，我明确了现在我们的任务是要保证社会主义经济成份的不断增长，我们应该监督资方积极经营对国计民生有利的事业，不再重犯五毒，很快完成应缴税款，不偷不漏，并督促与帮助私营工商业实行社会主义改造。
    我安心工作了
    华东区纺织纤维检验局　常彬
    我做的是扦棉花样子工作，每天到仓库去把棉花样子拿回来交给检验同志，就算完成了任务。我干了几天，心里想：难道这就是“经济建设工作”吗？为什么不派我到工厂去呢？
    自从听了关于总路线总任务的报告后，我认识到参加祖国的经济建设不一定都要在工厂里，我们无论担任什么工作，都可以为建设社会主义社会的事业贡献自己的一份力量。
    纤维检验工作对于提供纺织工业使用优良品质的原料，是起着重要的作用的。虽然我只是做扦棉花样子的工作，可是只要我能在这件具体工作中做得认真、负责，使检验同志顺利地进行工作，也就是在社会主义建设事业中发挥了自己的力量。
    我不该把余钱拿去囤麦子
    焦作李封矿工人　徐乱
    我是焦作李封矿的七级“老掘”。解放后这几年，我省吃俭用，积攒了不少的钱。积攒的钱怎样处理呢？一有闲空我就考虑这桩事。放账，或者买地，再不然投入私营商店去做生意；翻过来一想，不对，工人阶级不能去剥削人呀！可不能这样作，可是剩的钱弄什么花呢？想来想去我就买了七十万元的麦子放着。
    事情过了没多久，我岳父来了，他见我就说：“还是买些房子地，地是根呀！将来老了回家也有个靠山。”我一听，话说的也有道理，于是在今年六月间就买了一片地基，并计划再买些砖瓦梁盖房子。十月间，我岳父说轧花机不错，挺赚钱，我又买了一部轧花机。最近，我又和我哥哥商量，准备再在宁国村买两串破院房。
    前些时候，矿上党委副书记给我们报告了国家过渡时期的总路线和总任务，又让我们进行讨论学习，这一来，我知道自己过去囤麦子，一心想置产置业的想法是错了。应该把节约的钱存入银行，为国家积累资金，来建设我们的祖国。国家社会主义工业化了，我还会受罪吗？买轧花机，囤麦子，做生意，那是向资本主义道路上发展，这样的结果，会使我脱离工厂，不当工人，甚至会成个资本家，回想起来是多么危险呀！国家的总路线照亮了我前进的道路，我要把家里存的五石麦子卖给国家，余钱存入银行，为国家积累资金。
    我要为国家培养更多的技工
    天津电车公司技术员　刘奇英
    我活了六十岁，在旧社会里，受了许多气，每天装烟倒茶，讨得师父的欢喜，才学到了一点本事。解放后，领导上提拔我，让我当了领班，又帮助我改装和创造了二十多种机器、工具。我还被选为劳动模范。我因为在旧社会里尝够了学不到技术的苦，现在就决心把技术公开，教徒弟。听了关于国家过渡时期的总路线的报告，我更认识到带好徒弟的重要了：给国家培养更多的技工，我们国家过渡到社会主义社会也就会更快啦！
    提前超额完成国家生产计划
    天津市特等劳动模范　刘长福
    在没有听关于国家过渡时期总路线的报告前，有不少工人同志觉得社会主义社会反正要来的，咱就跟着走吧。听到报告以后，才明白了，跟着走还不够，今天我们出力多少和社会主义社会的到来有很大关系。我自己也从思想上认识了，我今天怎样把工作做得好了又好，提前与超额完成一九五三年的计划，那就是为明年的建设打下了基础，那就是为向社会主义社会前进铺了一块砖。说到提前与超额完成国家建设计划，过去每次竞赛完了以后，往往不能把竞赛的劲头巩固下来，竞赛一完，生产上便松了劲。通过这次总路线的讨论，大家都认识到了过去竞赛中的缺点，认识到必须把提前与超额完成计划当作经常的任务，工人们只有经常完成与超额完成国家计划，才能使我们国家稳步过渡到社会主义社会。
