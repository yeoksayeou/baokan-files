A total of 176 representatives were elected in the district, of which workers accounted for 33.1%, women accounted for 30%, and ethnic minorities accounted for 9.1%. Among the elected representatives, there are also considerable numbers of working cadres from government agencies, democratic parties, and people's organizations, as well as cultural and educational workers, students, health and medical workers, private industrialists and businessmen, handicraftsmen, religious figures, and residents of the streets. These representatives are the most outstanding figures from all ethnic groups and all walks of life and are satisfactory to the masses.

Many labor models and outstanding workers were elected as representatives. Du Ruo, Secretary of the Xidan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Head of the Xidan District People's Government, as well as other responsible persons in the district and labor models among the workers, received the most votes. The two representative candidates from the Zhongnanhai electoral district, where the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government are located—Communist Party member Wang Jingxian and non-party member Shen Qian—were also elected as representatives to the People's Congress of Xidan District with extremely high votes.

The voters showed great trust and hope in the representatives they elected.

Voters and Young Pioneers enthusiastically presented flowers to the representatives and shook hands to congratulate them. Many voters said with confidence at the voter meetings: With good representatives elected, our motherland will be built better, and the country's socialist industrialization will have a better guarantee. Many elected representatives also spoke at the meetings, expressing their gratitude for the trust of the voters and thanking Chairman Mao and the Communist Party for bringing them glory. They unanimously expressed to the voters their determination to be good servants of the people and to strive to realize the general line of the state's transition period. Du Ruo, Secretary of the Xidan District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Head of the Xidan District People's Government, who was elected as a representative to the District People's Congress by the voters of the East Electoral District of Chaoshou Hutong, said at the voter meeting: "With your trust and with the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, I have the confidence and determination to work a hundred times harder with everyone to complete the tasks entrusted to me by the higher authorities and the people."
