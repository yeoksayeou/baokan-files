    The North China Cultural and Educational Committee has correctly formulated the 1954 cultural and educational work plan based on the Party's general line for the transition period.

    1953 was the first year of the national planned construction. The cultural and educational work in the North China region has achieved great success due to the implementation of the central government's policy of "consolidation, key development, quality improvement, and steady progress." The phenomena of impetuosity and chaos caused by subjectivism and decentralism have been basically overcome. Varying degrees of rectification have been carried out in schools, hospitals, cultural centers, theatrical troupes, and other undertakings. The situation has been further clarified, and cultural and educational undertakings have been gradually brought into the orbit of national construction, beginning to change the imbalance between the development of cultural and educational undertakings and the national economy, as well as the internal imbalances within cultural and educational work. When formulating the 1954 plan, the North China Cultural and Educational Committee, based on the general line for the transition period and the basic tasks of the first Five-Year Plan, further reviewed the work of 1953. It was found that the 1953 plan still had some aspects that were too high and too large, and the use of funds was relatively dispersed and average. In the preparation of the 1954 plan, the principle of "key construction, steady progress" was further emphasized, and the spirit of streamlining and thrift was implemented.

    Under the unified leadership of the North China Cultural and Educational Committee, the Education Bureau, Health Bureau, Culture Bureau, and News and Publication Office of the North China Administrative Committee convened planning meetings in late October to formulate the 1954 plan. The Literacy Elimination Work Committee and the Sports Commission also formulated plans separately. The North China Cultural and Educational Committee conducted a comprehensive study and balanced calculation of the above plans and programs, thereby determining the guidelines, tasks, and financial plan for the cultural and educational work in the North China region in 1954.

    The guiding principles and tasks emphasize the need to continue to implement the policy of "consolidation, key development, quality improvement, and steady progress," with particular emphasis on strengthening the study of the national general line by cultural and educational cadres and continuing to deepen the struggle against subjectivism, bureaucracy, and decentralism in the cultural and educational system, and improving the style of leadership. In the work, on the basis of rectification and consolidation, emphasis should be placed on improving quality, grasping key points, deepening work, and effectively running key schools, hospitals, theatrical troupes, cultural centers, etc., to set examples and promote the general. We must make arduous efforts to effectively improve cultural and educational work and further adapt to the needs of national construction.

    In terms of specific work: the focus of education should be on cultivating talents for construction and the teachers needed to cultivate talents for construction. We must strengthen higher education, secondary technical education, high schools, worker-peasant rapid middle schools, and higher and secondary normal schools. At the same time, while ensuring that key undertakings do not exceed financial targets, we must actively tap potential, use possible social forces, and appropriately meet the cultural needs of the masses. The basic task of health work is rectification and consolidation, with the focus on strengthening industrial and mining health work and urban medical work, and continuing to carry out the patriotic health campaign, prevent and control diseases that are most harmful to the people, strengthen the training of medical cadres, and unite with traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. Cultural work should focus on improving quality on the basis of rectification, with emphasis on film, drama, cultural centers, cadre training, and mass art. Literacy elimination work should be carried out in a focused and step-by-step manner based on the principles of serving production and mass voluntarism. The work of news and publication should focus on rectification and consolidation, improving the quality of publications, and striving for a balance between supply and demand. Sports work should focus on vigorously training key personnel and continuing to carry out mass sports activities.

    Financial plan: In the spirit of spending less money, doing more, and doing it well, emphasis is placed on key construction, making the use of funds more concentrated; implementing the spirit of streamlining and thrift, appropriately reducing expenditure standards and tightening quotas; overcoming egalitarianism; and tapping potential. This will ensure that key undertakings are guaranteed and general undertakings can be maintained.

    In addition, the plan also anticipates problems in next year's work and pays attention to preparing for solutions early, especially the issue of the future of graduates from senior primary schools. In addition to appropriately expanding the proportion of enrollment in cities and encouraging social forces to run schools, it is also necessary to strengthen labor production education for students and their parents, reverse the thinking of "separation from production and separation from the countryside," to benefit national construction.

    华北文化教育委员会
    根据总路线编制一九五四年文教工作计划
    华北文化教育委员会根据国家在过渡时期的总路线，正确地编制出一九五四年的文教工作计划。
   一九五三年是国家进入计划建设的头一年，华北区的文教工作，由于贯彻了中央所规定的“整顿巩固、重点发展、提高质量、稳步前进”的方针取得很大成绩；由主观主义、分散主义所造成的急躁冒进和混乱现象已基本克服；对学校、医院、文化馆、剧团等各种事业，都进行了不同程度的整顿；并进一步摸清了情况，把文教事业逐步地纳入国家建设的轨道，开始改变着文教事业发展和国民经济的不相应的状态和文教工作内部的不平衡状况。华北文委在编制一九五四年计划时，根据国家在过渡时期总路线和第一个五年建设计划的基本任务，进一步检查了一九五三年的工作，认为一九五三年计划，在某些方面还存在着偏高、偏大的现象，经费使用上也比较分散和平均。在编制一九五四年计划中，进一步强调了“重点建设、稳步前进”的方针，贯彻了精简节约精神。
    在华北文委统一领导下，华北行政委员会教育局、卫生局、文化局、新闻出版处，分别在十月下旬召开了计划会议，拟定了一九五四年计划；扫除文盲工作委员会、体育运动委员会也分别拟定了方案。华北文委对以上计划、方案又进行了综合研究，平衡计算，从而确定了华北区一九五四年文教工作的方针、任务和财务计划。
    在方针、任务中着重提出：要继续贯彻“整顿巩固、重点发展、提高质量、稳步前进”的方针，特别要重视和加强文教干部对国家总路线的学习，并在文教系统中继续深入反对主观主义、官僚主义、分散主义的斗争，改进领导作风。在工作中，要在整顿巩固的基础上，强调提高质量，抓住重点，深入工作，切实办好重点学校、医院、剧团、文化馆等，树立榜样，推动一般。要经过艰巨的努力切实改进文教工作，进一步适应国家建设的需要。
    在具体工作上：教育工作，重点放在培养建设人材以及为培养建设人材所需要的师资方面。要加强高等教育、中等技术教育、高中、工农速成中学以及高等和中等师范。同时在保证重点事业不突破财务指标条件下，积极挖掘潜力，运用可能运用的社会力量，适当满足群众文化要求。卫生工作，基本上是整顿巩固，重点放在加强工矿卫生工作和城市医疗工作，并继续开展爱国卫生运动，防治对人民危害最大的疾病，加强医务干部的培养和对中医的团结。文化工作，在整顿基础上着重提高质量，重点是电影、戏剧、文化馆、干部训练和群众文艺。扫除文盲工作，根据服务生产和群众自愿原则，有重点有步骤地开展。新闻出版工作，着重整顿巩固，提高出版物质量，力求供需平衡。体育工作，主要是大力培养训练骨干，继续开展群众性体育活动。
    财务计划：本少花钱、多办事、办得好的精神强调了重点建设，使经费使用更加集中；贯彻精简节约精神，适当降低开支标准与紧缩定额；克服平均主义；挖掘潜力；这样就可使重点事业得到保证，一般事业可以维持。
    此外，计划中并预计到明年工作中的问题，注意提早准备解决，其中特别是高小毕业生出路问题，除适当扩大城市升学比例，鼓励社会力量办学外，还必须加强对学生及其家长的劳动生产教育，扭转“脱离生产、脱离农村”的思想，以利国家建设。（新华社）
