    East China's cooperative system exceeded its November cotton purchase plan.
    After cotton purchase prices were raised in early November, cooperatives in various parts of East China increased purchasing personnel, added purchasing points and purchasing tools, and strengthened processing capabilities to facilitate cotton farmers' sales. Nearly 70 power-driven cotton ginning factories in Jiangsu Province launched a labor emulation campaign. Many counties in the Huimin Special District of Shandong Province added 30 to 50 new cotton ginning machines, and the Dezhou Special District organized nearly 10,000 temporary processing workers.
    Cotton farmers in East China were very satisfied with the state's increase in cotton purchase prices and the vigorous expansion of purchasing, and therefore enthusiastically sold their cotton to the state. From November 1st to 3rd, the average daily cotton purchase quantity in Nanhui County, Jiangsu Province, increased more than threefold compared to October 31st. At the same time, many cotton farmers deposited their cotton with the cooperatives; the amount accepted for deposit in cooperatives throughout Jiangsu Province in November accounted for 11% of the purchased quantity.
    State-owned commercial departments and cooperatives in various parts of East China cooperated with the cotton purchase work and supplied cotton farmers with a large amount of materials. The Boxing County Cooperative in Shandong Province purchased more than 9,000 jin of iron at one time to supply local iron production cooperatives for the manufacture of small farm tools. The sales volume of the business office of the state-owned department store in Sanyu cotton-producing area of ​​Nantong County, Jiangsu Province, increased by 40 million yuan in the first 20 days of November compared to the entire month of October.
    Generally speaking, East China completed 1.44% above the November cotton purchase plan, but the plan completion was uneven. Some areas have not well implemented the spirit of mass purchase; the November cotton purchase plans of Shandong, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces were completed poorly. The East China Administrative Committee's Financial and Economic Committee has now instructed the financial committees of East China to strengthen the leadership of cotton purchase while leading the purchase of grain, and to educate farmers to sell cotton to support industrial production through the propaganda of the general line of the state's transition period.

    华东区合作社超额完成十一月份购棉计划
    华东财委指示加强对购棉工作的领导
    华东区合作社系统超额完成了十一月份收购棉花的计划。
    十一月初棉花收购价格上调后，华东各地合作社为便利棉农售棉，都增加了收购人员，增添了收购点和收购工具，同时加强了加工力量。江苏省近七十个动力轧花厂开展了劳动竞赛。山东省惠民专区不少县增设了三十台到五十台新轧花车，德州专区组织了近万名临时加工工人。
    华东各地棉农对国家调高收棉价格和大力展开收购非常满意，因而踊跃把棉花卖给国家。江苏省南汇县十一月一日到三日，每天平均收购棉花数量比十月三十一日增加三倍多。同时许多棉农将棉花向合作社存实，江苏省各地合作社十一月份接受存实的数量占收购量的百分之十一。
    华东各地国营商业部门和合作社配合购棉工作，供应棉农大量物资。山东省博兴县合作社一次就采购了九千多斤铁，供给当地的铁业生产合作社用来制造小农具。著名的江苏省南通县三余棉产区国营百货商店营业处的销货数量，十一月份前二十天比十月份全月增加了四千万元。
    华东区十一月份购棉数量总的说来，超额百分之一点四四完成了计划，但计划完成情况是不平衡的。有些地区还没有很好地贯彻大量收购的精神，山东、浙江、安徽三省十一月份购棉计划就完成得较差。现华东行政委员会财政经济委员会已指示华东各地财委，在领导收购粮食的同时，加强对收购棉花的领导，通过国家过渡时期总路线的宣传，教育农民出售棉花支持工业生产。
