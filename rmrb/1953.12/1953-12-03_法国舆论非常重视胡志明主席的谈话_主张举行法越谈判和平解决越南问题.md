Xinhua News Agency, Paris, December 2nd: TASS, Paris, December 1st: All Parisian newspapers are commenting on the response of Chairman Ho Chi Minh of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to questions posed by the editor of the Swedish newspaper "Expressen," in which Chairman Ho Chi Minh stated that he would be willing to achieve a truce through negotiations if France were willing.

French democrats felt very satisfied upon learning of this news. "Liberation" stated that the French government must immediately take measures to ensure the holding of negotiations and must not allow any external interference in this matter. The newspaper said, "A ceasefire and truce on the Franco-Vietnamese front is a matter for the belligerent parties and only concerns the belligerent parties. Negotiations can only be held between the belligerent parties, that is, France and Vietnam. It is unimaginable to allow others to interfere in such negotiations. We openly declare that Eisenhower cannot prohibit the French government from concluding a truce agreement with Ho Chi Minh. Any external pressure is not only inappropriate but will also be met with angry accusations from French public opinion."

Right-wing bourgeois newspapers also acknowledged the necessity of holding peace talks, citing the fact that the French expeditionary force has proven unable to resolve the issue in a way that is favorable to it through military action.

"Le Figaro" pointed out that Ho Chi Minh's statements are an "important factor." The newspaper added, "If there is a possibility of holding sincere and fair negotiations to end this regrettable Indochina war, it should be seized immediately."

The newspaper continued, "It must be admitted that our army has proven unable to eliminate the enemy forces. In order to end this war, which has become a war of attrition, a peaceful resolution is necessary." However, the newspaper immediately mentioned the so-called "obligations of France to the member states of the Federation."

Various newspapers also published statements by certain political leaders regarding Ho Chi Minh's statements. Minister of State for Relations with the Member States of the Indochina Federation, Marc Jacquet, who recently returned from Indochina, declared that Ho Chi Minh's statements have "worldwide significance." However, the Prime Minister's Office immediately issued a statement declaring that Jacquet's statement "cannot be regarded as representing the attitude of the government."

Socialist Member of Parliament Jules Moch said: "We must accept any statement aimed at ending the war with a light heart, even if this statement is not made according to diplomatic conventions. For the sake of peace and disarmament, we must take advantage of this new trend."

"Le Monde" published an editorial on Ho Chi Minh's statements, one section of which said: "If the French government wants to negotiate, it will encounter a counterpart with the same willingness. It seems that we are slowly but surely approaching the possibility of negotiations." At the same time, the newspaper supported the so-called participation of the member states of the Federation in the negotiations (the member states of the Federation are the various puppet regimes in Indochina) and doubted "whether such negotiations will be successful."

"Le Monde" and "Paris-Presse" both published news that Ho Chi Minh's statements had caused panic within the Bảo Đại group.

### 法国舆论非常重视胡志明主席的谈话  主张举行法越谈判和平解决越南问题

    法国舆论非常重视胡志明主席的谈话
    主张举行法越谈判和平解决越南问题
    【新华社二日讯】塔斯社巴黎一日讯：巴黎所有报纸都评论越南民主共和国政府胡志明主席对瑞典“快报”主编所提问题的答复，胡志明主席在答复中表示，如果法国愿意的话，他愿意经过谈判来获得停战。
    法国民主人士在得知这项消息时，都感到非常满意。“解放报”说，法国政府必须立刻采取措施来保证谈判的举行，不能容许对这件事的任何外来的干涉。这个报纸说，“法—越战线上的停火和停战是交战双方的事，只牵涉到交战双方。谈判只能在交战双方之间举行，这就是法国和越南。假如让别人来干预这种谈判，那是难于想像的事。我们公开宣布，艾森豪威尔不能禁止法国政府与胡志明缔结停战协定。任何外来压力不但不合时宜，而且会受到法国舆论的愤怒指责。”
    右翼的资产阶级报纸也承认必须举行和平谈判，它们并以下列事实说明这种必要性，就是事实证明，法国远征军并不能以军事行动来以对它有利的方式解决这个问题。
    “费加罗报”指出，胡志明的谈话是一个“重要的因素”。该报又说：“假如有举行诚恳的、公正的谈判以结束这场令人遗憾的印度支那战争的可能性的话，就应该立刻加以利用。”
    该报继续说：“必须承认我们的军队已证明不能消灭敌军。为了结束这场已经成为消耗战的战争，和平解决是必要的。”可是，该报又立即提到所谓“法国对联邦成员国的义务”。
    各报还刊载了某些政治领袖就胡志明的谈话发表的声明。最近自印度支那返国的负责印度支那联邦成员国关系事务的国务秘书马尔·雅盖宣称，胡志明的谈话具有“世界性的意义”。但内阁总理办公室立即就发表一项声明，宣称雅盖的声明“不能被认为是代表政府的态度”。
    社会党议员儒勒·莫克说：“我们必须以轻松的心情来接受任何旨在结束战争的声明，即使这个声明不是按照外交惯例发表的。为了和平，为了裁减军备，我们一定要利用这种新趋势。”
      “世界报”就胡志明的谈话发表了一篇社论，其中一节说：“如果法国政府要谈判的话，它将遇到一位怀有同样意愿的对方。看来，我们是在缓慢而稳步地接近谈判的可能性。”同时该报赞成所谓联邦成员国参加谈判（联邦成员国即印度支那的各个傀儡政权），并怀疑“这样的谈判是否会成功”。
    “世界报”和“巴黎急进新闻”都刊载了胡志明的谈话在保大集团中引起恐慌的消息。
