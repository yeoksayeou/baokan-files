    Leading the Entire Village's Peasants to Organize
    —Introducing the Work Experience of Yang Yonggao, Party Branch Secretary of Yanggao Village, Pingshun County
    Yanggao Village, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, has, through the hard work of the Communist Party branch and branch secretary Yang Yonggao, organized the entire village. Out of 267 households, 159 households have been organized into three agricultural production cooperatives and four year-round mutual aid teams. Due to "getting organized," cultivation techniques have been improved, and every family has harvested more grain, improving their lives. Everyone reflects, "Following the Communist Party closely leads to better and better times."
    How did Branch Secretary Yang Yonggao organize the entire village? He said that to do a good job in mutual aid and cooperation, it is not only necessary to publicize the Party's mutual aid and cooperation policies but also to participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations as an example. If what you say and what you do are different, then mutual aid and cooperation cannot be achieved. When establishing agricultural production cooperatives, some people wanted to contribute distant and bad land to the cooperative, while keeping nearby and good land for themselves. After Yang Yonggao learned about this, he took the lead in contributing his seven mu of good land to the cooperative, and then went to mobilize others. In this way, everyone also contributed their good land to the cooperative, keeping only medium and low-grade land for themselves. After the establishment of the agricultural production cooperative, Yang Yonggao also frequently promoted the importance of protecting the collective's interests to the masses, thereby consolidating and developing mutual aid and cooperation organizations. This spring, Yang Yonggao bought several pieces of used clothing from a peddler on the street. The peddler wanted to exchange them for peppercorns, saying that each jin could fetch two thousand yuan more than at the supply and marketing cooperative. But Yang Yonggao said, "We're talking about money, but we can't give you peppercorns." Yang Yonggao sold the peppercorns to the supply and marketing cooperative. Someone asked him, "Old Yang, twenty-three jin of peppercorns could have sold for 46,000 yuan more. Why did you insist on selling them to the supply and marketing cooperative?" Yang Yonggao replied, "The supply and marketing cooperative belongs to all of us. If the supply and marketing cooperative makes money, then we make money. We must not sell the peppercorns to private merchants just to make a few more bucks for ourselves." Afterward, he repeatedly explained this principle to everyone. When everyone understood this principle, they all said, "Old Yang is really our good cadre, thinking of everyone's interests in everything." In June, the river swelled rapidly, and the sluice gate of the beach canal was breached. It looked like the flood was about to wash away the forty mu of collective corn. At this time, Yang Yonggao quickly mobilized the masses to block the water. When they arrived at the river, everyone saw that the river was very large. You looked at me, and I looked at you, and no one dared to go down to block it first. Yang Yonggao's health was not good to begin with, but he thought that he could not watch the cornfield being washed away by the flood. Communists must lead everyone forward in times of difficulty. So he jumped into the water. At this time, more than fifty young lads standing on the bank also jumped down and worked hard to block the sluice gate. Everyone knew that Yang Yonggao's health was not good and that he could not withstand such a large flood, so they insisted that he come ashore. After Yang Yonggao came ashore, he did not rest but instead transported stones and firewood on the bank with a group of elderly people, letting the young people block the breach. Through everyone's efforts, the sluice gate was blocked, and the cornfield was saved. Through this kind of education, the peasants' collectivist thinking gradually increased, and mutual aid and cooperation organizations gradually consolidated.
    When Yang Yonggao led mutual aid and cooperation, he also paid attention to strengthening the Party's unified leadership, thereby enabling agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams to unite closely and develop together. First of all, the ten branch committee members were assigned responsibilities to go deep into the three agricultural production cooperatives and five mutual aid teams, and Party and Youth League groups and reading groups were established according to the production organization. Secondly, after the production plan for each season was formulated, the Party and Youth League members would first formulate guarantee conditions within the Party and Youth League groups, and then let everyone return to the cooperatives and teams to take the lead in mobilizing the masses to implement it. After an agricultural activity came to an end, the inspection, evaluation, and summary were still carried out within the Party and Youth League first, and then the evaluation and summary were carried out among all the cooperative members and team members. In this way, from within the Party to outside the Party, the Party's leadership role was fully exerted, every Party member and Youth League member was trained, and the complete realization of the quarterly production plans was guaranteed. After the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives, the branch paid more attention to strengthening the Party's unified leadership; otherwise, there could easily be localism between cooperatives and between cooperatives and teams, which would affect the development of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams. Yang Yonggao foresaw this point, so he often educated everyone within the Party, saying: "Branch committee members and every Party member must proceed from an overall perspective, always focusing on the greatest interests of all the people, and must not engage in localism. Party members should not only avoid engaging in localism themselves, but also use collectivist thinking to educate the masses." In his work, Yang Yonggao insisted that anything that the three agricultural production cooperatives should unify or could unify should be unified. For example, in land appraisal and the implementation of contracting work, if it were not carried out in a unified manner, the three cooperatives would appraise the same soil quality and generally similar distances of land into several yields and several work quotas, which would cause ideological confusion among the cooperative members. Yang Yonggao led everyone to adopt the method of unified land appraisal and contracting work by the three cooperatives, which resulted in labor savings, reasonableness, and satisfaction for everyone. Also, several cooperative members originally shared a threshing ground, but they were not in the same agricultural production cooperative. Don't think this is a minor issue, but if it is not properly resolved in advance, there may be a phenomenon of mutual competition for the threshing ground during the autumn harvest and summer threshing, which would directly affect the unity between cooperatives. Before this year's summer harvest, Yang Yonggao convened a meeting of responsible cadres from the three cooperatives and made unified and reasonable adjustments, avoiding the occurrence of competition for the threshing ground. In addition to the village supply and marketing cooperative, the county supply and marketing cooperative also had a supply station here that frequently transported goods. In order to better enable the cooperatives and teams to engage in transportation sideline production, to avoid the chaotic phenomenon of some people competing to be first,搶多少 [TN: Likely "rushing to do a lot" or "grabbing at assignments"], getting busy when no one was doing it, and抢着搞 [TN: Likely "scrambling to do it" or "rushing to do it"] when they were idle, it was decided that branch committee member He Hancheng would be responsible for contacting the supply station and the supply and marketing cooperative and for uniformly allocating the labor and livestock power of each cooperative and team to carry out sideline production. This shows that the higher the degree to which rural areas are organized, the more unified leadership and unified arrangements are needed in all work. In this way, mutual unity and the power of collectivism can be better exerted. There are endless examples of this: The sheep of the Wang Tianshun agricultural production cooperative had no one to herd them, and the Yang Yonggao agricultural production cooperative had surplus shepherds. Yang Yonggao educated He Shuikuan (the shepherd) in his own cooperative to take his land and transfer to the Wang Tianshun agricultural production cooperative. The Tian Lizhe and Wang Shuntian agricultural production cooperatives had sheep but no place to trample the manure. The members of Yang Yonggao agricultural production cooperative voluntarily lent them five-hole sheepfold kilns. The mutual aid teams had little labor and livestock power, and it was difficult to adjust their lives during the busy farming season. From the spring of this year to before the autumn plowing, the three agricultural production cooperatives plowed seventy-one mu of land for the mutual aid teams and planted eighteen mu of seeds. Some children in the teams sang: "Agricultural production cooperatives, our elder brothers, help us plow the fields and push the millstone." This kind of unified leadership and unified action is a very good kind of collectivist education. (Xing Jie, Pei Han, Feng Min, Zhong Yuan)

    领导全村农民组织起来
    ——介绍平顺县阳高村党支部书记杨永高的工作经验
    山西省平顺县阳高村，经过共产党支部和支部书记杨永高的努力工作，全村都组织起来了。在二百六十七户中，就有一百五十九户分别组织了三个农业生产合作社和四个常年互助组。由于“组织起来”，改进了耕作技术，家家多打了粮食，改善了生活。大家反映：“紧紧跟着共产党走，越过越有好时光。”
    支部书记杨永高是怎样把全村组织起来的呢？他说要搞好互助合作，不但要宣传党的互助合作政策、而且要以身作则地参加互助合作组织。要是说的做的是两样，那末互助合作是搞不起来的。创办农业生产合作社时，曾有人想把远地、坏地入社，近地、好地留下自己种。杨永高知道后，把自己的七亩好地首先入社，而后再去动员别人。这样，大家也把好地入了社，自留的都是中、下等地。成立农业生产合作社后，杨永高还经常向群众宣传要爱护集体的利益，由此来巩固和发展互助合作组织。今年春天，杨永高在街上从估衣商那里买了几件旧衣服，估衣商要他用花椒来换，并说每斤可比供销合作社多顶二千元。但杨永高说：“咱们讲的是钱，可不能给你花椒。”杨永高把花椒卖给了供销合作社。有人就问他：“老杨，二十三斤花椒，能多卖四万六千元，你一定要卖给供销合作社干啥？”杨永高回答说：“供销合作社是咱们大家的，供销合作社赚了钱，就是咱们赚了钱，决不能为了自己多得几个钱，就将花椒卖给私商。”过后他又反覆给大家讲解这个道理。当大家懂得了这个道理后，都说：老杨真是咱们的好干部，事事都从大伙的利益着想。六月间河水猛涨，滩渠的闸门被冲破了，眼看大水就要把集体耕作的四十亩玉茭冲了。这时，杨永高就赶快发动群众去挡水。到了河边，大家看看河水很大，你看我、我看你，谁也不敢先下去堵挡。杨永高的身体本来不好，但他想，决不能看着玉茭地被大水冲没，共产党员就要在困难时候带领大家前进。于是他就跳下水去了。这时在岸上站着的五十多个年青小伙子们也都跟着跳下去，奋力堵挡闸口。大家知道杨永高身体不好，抗不住这样的大水，一定要他上岸。杨永高上岸后，并不休息，又在岸上和一伙老年人们搬运石头柴草，让年青人堵口。经过大家努力，闸口堵起了，玉茭地保住了。经过这样的教育，农民的集体主义思想慢慢增强，互助合作组织也就慢慢巩固。
    杨永高领导互助合作时，还注意加强党的统一领导，由此使农业生产合作社、互助组，紧密地团结在一起，共同发展。首先，支部十一个委员分工负责深入到三个农业生产合作社、五个互助组里，并按生产组织建立了党、团小组和读报组。其次，每个季节的生产计划制定后，首先在党、团内部分别以党、团员小组订出保证条件，然后让大家回到社里，组里带头发动群众执行。一个农事活动告一段落后，仍是先在党、团内部进行检查、评比、总结，然后再在全体社员、组员中评比、总结。这样由党内到党外，就充分发挥了党的领导作用，锻炼了每个党员和团员，保证了各季度生产计划的完满实现。在成立农业生产合作社以后，支部更注意加强了党的统一领导，否则，社与社、社与组之间很容易闹本位主义，影响农业生产合作社和互助组的发展。杨永高预见到这一点，所以他就经常在党内教育大家说：“支部委员和每个党员必须从全面出发，处处从全体人民的最大利益着眼，不能闹本位主义。党员不光自己不闹本位主义，还应用集体主义思想去教育群众。”杨永高在工作中，对于凡是三个农业生产合作社应该统一办也可以统一办的事，一定要让统一来办。例如在土地评产和实行包工时，如不统一进行，三个社就会把同样的土质、一般远近的土地，评成几种产量和几种工额，这就要引起社员的思想混乱。杨永高领导大家采用三个社统一评产包工的办法，结果又省工又合理，人人满意。又如有几个社员原来伙用着一个场，但不是在一个农业生产合作社里。不要看这个问题不大，但如果不事先适当解决，收秋打夏时就可能发生互相争场的现象，而直接影响到社与社之间的团结。杨永高在今年夏收前，就召集三个社的负责干部开会，作了统一合理的调剂，避免了争场现象的发生。阳高村除村供销合作社外，还有县供销合作社在这里设的供应站经常要运送货物。为了更好地使各社各组搞运输副业生产，以避免有的人争先后，抢多少，忙了没人干，闲了抢着搞的混乱现象，就确定由支部委员何汉成负责和供应站、供销合作社联系，并统一调配各社各组的劳力畜力，进行副业生产。这说明农村组织起来的程度越高，一切工作也就更需要统一领导，统一安排。这样，互相团结，集体主义的力量也就更能发挥。这类的例子是说不完的：王天顺农业生产合作社社员的羊群没有人放，杨永高农业生产合作社的羊工多，杨永高就教育本社社员何水宽（羊工）带上自己土地转入王天顺农业生产合作社。田理则、王顺天两个农业生产合作社有羊群没处踩圈，杨永高农业生产合作社的社员就自动借给他们五孔圈羊窑。互助组的劳力畜力少，农忙时调剂不开生活，三个农业生产合作社从今年春天到秋耕前就给互助组犁、耙了七十一亩地，下了十八亩种。组员家里有些小孩这样唱：“农业生产合作社老大哥，帮俺犁地推碾磨”。这种统一领导、统一行动，就是一种很好的集体主义教育。  （星洁、培汉、峰岷、中元）
