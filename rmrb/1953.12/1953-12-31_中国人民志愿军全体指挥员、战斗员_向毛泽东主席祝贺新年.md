Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 30th: All commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army sent a telegram to Chairman Mao on the 30th to congratulate him on the New Year. The full text of the original telegram is as follows:

    Dear Chairman Mao:
    The New Year of 1954 is approaching, and our great motherland has taken another step forward in its transition to socialism. We, all the commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army, express our warmest congratulations and highest respect to you from afar with incomparable joy.

    Dear Chairman Mao: As the New Year approaches, allow us to report to you that in 1953, under your care and leadership, with the full support of the people of the motherland and the people of Korea, and with the support and solidarity of peace-loving people all over the world, we fought victoriously alongside the Korean People's Army and won the realization of the Korean Armistice. After the armistice, we have always maintained a high degree of vigilance and strict preparedness, rapidly strengthened new defense lines, and intensified troop training to improve combat effectiveness, further regularizing and modernizing our army. Now, the enemy is doing its utmost to maintain the unstable state of the Korean armistice, conspiring to detain prisoners of war and sabotage the holding of political conferences. We assure you and the people of the motherland that we will definitely increase our vigilance, strengthen our preparedness, and if the enemy dares to perfidiously risk an invasion, we will certainly be able to inflict a merciless blow together with the heroic Korean people. We will spare no effort to fight to the end to ensure the thorough implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement and to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. For the sake of the construction of the motherland, we have launched a movement to tighten expenditures, practice strict economy, and cherish the materials of the motherland, and we will continue to vigorously implement it next year. Dear Chairman Mao: We are earnestly implementing your teachings and striving to strengthen unity with the heroic Korean people and the Korean People's Army. In the past year, many more internationalist fighters like Luo Shengjiao have emerged in the army—such as Shi Yuanhou, Lü Yujiu, Zhang Minglu, Wang Yongwei, etc. In the great projects of helping the Korean people repair the Jianlong Reservoir and rebuild Pyongyang, and in helping the Korean people rebuild their homes, we have further developed the friendship and unity between the Korean people. In the future, we will definitely further enhance our level of internationalist consciousness and strive to further consolidate and develop the militant friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples!

    Dear Chairman Mao: All our commanders and fighters wish you a happy New Year, good health, and boundless longevity!

        All Commanders and Fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
                          December 30, 1953

    【新华社平壤三十日电】中国人民志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员在三十日打电报向毛主席祝贺新年。原电全文如下：亲爱的毛主席：
    一九五四年的新年就要来临了，我们伟大的祖国，在向社会主义过渡中又前进了一步。我们志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员，谨以无比欢欣的心情，遥向您致最热烈的祝贺和最崇高的敬意。
    亲爱的毛主席：在新年到来时，让我们向您报告一九五三年我们在您的关怀和您的领导下，在祖国人民和朝鲜人民全力支援下，在全世界爱好和平的人民的支援与声援下，和朝鲜人民军一道进行了胜利的斗争，赢得了朝鲜停战的实现。在停战之后，我们始终保持了高度的警惕和严密的戒备，迅速加强了新的防线，加紧整训部队，提高战斗力，使我军进一步正规化和现代化。现在，敌人正在竭力保持朝鲜停战的不稳定状态，阴谋扣留战俘和破坏政治会议的召开。我们向您和祖国人民保证：我们一定更加提高警惕、加强戒备，如果敌人胆敢背信弃义冒险进犯，我们一定能和英雄的朝鲜人民一起，给以无情的打击。我们一定为保障朝鲜停战协定的彻底实施，为争取朝鲜问题的和平解决，而不惜一切地奋斗到底。为了祖国建设，我们展开了紧缩开支、厉行节约、爱护祖国物资的运动，明年我们还要继续大力贯彻。亲爱的毛主席：我们认真地执行着您的教导，努力加强与英雄的朝鲜人民、朝鲜人民军的团结。一年来，全军又涌现了不少罗盛教式的国际主义战士——像史元厚、吕玉久、张明禄、王永维等。我们在帮助朝鲜人民修复见龙贮水池和重建平壤市的巨大工程中，在帮助朝鲜人民重建家园的工作中，更进一步发展了和朝鲜人民之间的友谊团结。我们在今后定将更加提高自己的国际主义的觉悟水平，为更加巩固与发展中朝人民之间的战斗友谊而奋斗！
    亲爱的毛主席：我们全体指挥员、战斗员向您拜年，愿您新年健康，万寿无疆！
        中国人民志愿军全体指挥员、战斗员
                      一九五三年十二月三十日
