The Central Ministry of Fuel Industry and its subordinate Coal Mine Management Bureau, in order to deeply understand the situation of coal mine production and existing problems in the increase production and practice economy campaign, under the leadership of Minister Chen Yu, used the method of in-depth key points to promote the general, and in September and October of this year, conducted an in-depth inspection of the work of the Fushun Mining Bureau. The Fushun Mining Bureau's work since January to September this year has been successful, especially in the increase production and practice economy campaign, it launched a daily progress competition, reversing the situation of not completing the task from January to August, and by the end of September, it completed 100.4% of the cumulative plan for January to September. In terms of saving, it has saved more than 78 billion yuan for the country by September.

However, the inspection found that the Fushun Mining Bureau still had many serious shortcomings in certain key issues, which were prominently manifested in the following aspects: (1) Tunneling work could not keep up with mining. The tunneling workers and the tools used in each mine of the Mining Bureau were not fixed, the quality of the tools was poor, and the maintenance was not timely. For example, when tunneling workers in the Laohutai Mine asked the auxiliary workshop for cars, the answer they received was: "You can't produce ten cars of coal a day, it doesn't matter if you are delayed a little." At the same time, each mine did not seriously promote the advanced experience of tunneling work. For example, the two-stage pneumatic pick operation and deep drilling, multi-hole circulation and other advanced experiences of the Cao Lianhui team in the Longfeng Mine were not promoted, resulting in the phenomenon of no coal to mine. (2) Safety work was not done well enough, and accidents were serious. The number of accidents that occurred in the Mining Bureau this year increased compared with the same period last year. According to the statistics of one shift in one district of Laohutai Mine alone, accidents affected 1,963.8 work hours in September alone. (3) The production potential was not fully utilized, the mining speed was slow, the efficiency was low, and the number of monthly cycles was small. The electric shovels and electric locomotives in the open pit mines also failed to fully exert their effectiveness.
(4) In the increase production and practice economy campaign, there were still phenomena of indiscriminate mining and digging. Due to indiscriminate mining, the Laohutai Mine has lost 120,000 tons of coal from January to September (part of which is technically allowed to be left as coal pillars), and the Longfeng Mine has lost more than 20,000 tons of coal.

After the work group of the Ministry of Fuel found these problems, together with the leading cadres of the Fushun Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Fushun Mining Bureau and the responsible cadres of various mines, it held several forums in succession and deeply analyzed the reasons for these problems: the main reason was that the leading cadres of the Mining Bureau had a sense of complacency and their work was not in-depth. They did not have a sufficient understanding of the characteristics of coal mine production, especially the key issue of tunneling work. The Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry held a national coal mine work conference in June this year, repeatedly emphasizing the importance of tunneling work, but the leading cadres of the Fushun Mining Bureau did not seriously implement this instruction, and they did not deploy it to the mines until September 26. The main responsible cadres from the Bureau to the mines all floated on the top, the mine directors and chief engineers could not understand the production situation in time, and the leading cadres of the Mining Bureau did not know the production situation from January to August until October. Therefore, they could not command production well. In response to these problems, the work group of the Ministry of Fuel and the Fushun Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China also helped the leading cadres of the Fushun Mining Bureau criticize complacency and specifically pointed out the future practices: First, cadres at all levels must clarify the importance of tunneling work, strengthen the leadership of tunneling work, and improve the tunneling organization. And they should urge various auxiliary workshops to actively support tunneling work. Second, conscientiously implement the safety regulations and operating procedures, pay attention to carrying out workers' spare-time technical learning, and improve their technical level. Third, strengthen the shift handover instruction system, the district chief (mine area district chief) must preside over the shift handover meeting of the squad leader, and the mine director and engineer must preside over the shift handover meeting of the district chief; only in this way can we grasp the situation in time, strengthen front-line command, reduce accidents, and achieve the goal of balanced production. Fourth, continuously improve leadership style and leadership methods, be vigilant and overcome complacency, rely on the masses to continuously improve enterprise management, and increase production and save more wealth for the country. Finally, the leading cadres of the Fushun Mining Bureau made a review and are actively studying to improve their work.

These problems of the Fushun Mining Bureau also exist to varying degrees in other mining bureaus across the country. The Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry has circulated the inspection results of the Fushun Mining Bureau to all mining bureaus across the country to promote the work of coal mines across the country.

    燃料工业部深入检查抚顺矿务局工作
    中央燃料工业部及所属煤矿管理总局为了深入了解在增产节约运动中煤矿生产的情况和存在的问题，在陈郁部长领导下，用深入重点推动一般的方法，于今年九、十月间，深入检查了抚顺矿务局的工作。抚顺矿务局今年一至九月以来，工作是有成绩的，尤其在增产节约运动中展开了日进度竞赛，扭转了一至八月份没有完成任务的情况，至九月底完成了一至九月累进计划的百分之一百点四。在节约方面，至九月为止已为国家节约资金七百八十余亿元。
    但是，在检查中发现抚顺矿务局在某些关键性的问题上还存在着许多严重的缺点，突出的表现在如下几方面：（一）掘进工作赶不上回采。该矿务局各矿的掘进工人和所用的工具都不固定，工具的质量又不好，检修也不及时。如老虎台矿掘进工人向辅助车间要车时，得到的回答是：“你们一天的工作出不了十来车煤，耽误点不要紧。”同时各矿也没有认真推广掘进工作的先进经验。如龙凤矿曹连惠小组的两段风镐作业及深打眼、多孔循环等先进经验，都没有推广，因此造成无煤可采的现象。（二）安全工作作得不够，事故严重。该矿务局今年发生的事故次数较去年同时增多了。仅就老虎台矿一区一班统计，九月份一个月就因事故影响了一千九百六十三点八一个工时。（三）没有充分发挥生产潜力，回采的速度很慢，效率低，每月循环数少。露天的电铲和电机车也没有充分发挥效力。
  （四）在增产节约运动中，仍有乱采乱掘的现象。老虎台矿由于乱采，一至九月份已丢煤十二万吨（其中一部分是技术上允许留的煤柱），龙凤矿已丢煤两万多吨。
    燃料部工作组检查出这些问题后，协同中共抚顺市委和抚顺矿务局领导干部及各矿的负责干部，连续召开了几次座谈会，深入分析了发生这些问题的原因：主要是该矿务局领导干部存在自满情绪，工作不深入。他们对煤矿生产的特点认识不足，特别是对掘进工作这一关键问题认识不足。燃料部煤矿管理总局于今年六月份召开了全国煤矿工作会议，一再强调掘进工作的重要性，但抚顺矿务局领导干部对这一指示没有认真执行，他们直到九月二十六日才布置到矿上。从局到矿主要负责干部都漂在上边，矿长和主任工程师都不能及时了解生产情况，矿务局的领导干部到十月份才知道一至八月份的生产情况。因而不能很好地指挥生产。针对这些问题，燃料部工作组和中共抚顺市委又帮助抚顺矿务局的领导干部批判了自满情绪，具体指出今后的作法：一、各级干部必须明确掘进工作的重要性，加强对掘进工作的领导，健全掘进组织。并应督促各辅助车间积极支援掘进工作。二、认真贯彻保安规程与操作规程，注意开展工人的业余技术学习，提高他们的技术水平。三、加强交接班指示制度，区长（矿区区长）必须主持班长的交接班会议，矿长、工程师必须主持区长的交接班会议；只有这样，才能及时掌握情况，加强前线指挥，减少事故，达到均衡生产的目的。四、不断改进领导作风和领导方法，警惕和克服自满情绪，依靠群众不断改进企业管理，为国家增产节约更多的财富。最后，抚顺矿务局的领导干部作了检讨，正积极研究改进工作。
    抚顺矿务局的这些问题，在全国别的矿务局也或多或少存在着。燃料部煤矿管理总局已将对抚顺矿务局的检查结果，通报全国各矿务局，以推动全国煤矿工作。    （梁业兴）
