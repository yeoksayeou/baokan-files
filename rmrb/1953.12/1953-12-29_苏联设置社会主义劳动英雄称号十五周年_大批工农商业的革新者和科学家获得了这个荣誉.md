Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 28th. According to TASS, December 27th marked the fifteenth anniversary of the Soviet government's establishment of the highest honor in economic and cultural development – the title of Hero of Socialist Labor. Since the establishment of this title, a large number of outstanding innovators and scientific inventors in Soviet industry, agriculture, transportation, and commerce have received this honor. More than six thousand five hundred people have received this title in the post-war years alone. Their advanced experience and methods have been promoted among millions of Soviet people. For example, I. Valigura, the leader of a mining team in the Donets coal region, received the title of Hero of Socialist Labor for inventing a method that nearly doubled coal production. Prominent scientists such as I. Bardin, Vice President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Academician T. Lysenko, and many builders of the Lenin Volga-Don Canal have also received this honor.
	This year, dozens of collective farmers, combine operators, and state farm workers have received the title of Hero of Socialist Labor. Among them are Ukrainian collective farm work team leader M. Martson (whose managed fields produced 60,600 kilograms of sugar beets per hectare); combine operator P. Nektov (who harvested more than 1,600 hectares of grain this year). In addition, many people have received this highest honor twice for outstanding work. Any worker who has been awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor twice will have a bust erected in his hometown.

    苏联设置社会主义劳动英雄称号十五周年
    大批工农商业的革新者和科学家获得了这个荣誉
   【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：十二月二十七日，是苏联政府设置经济和文化发展方面的最高荣誉——社会主义劳动英雄称号的十五周年。自从这个称号设置以来，苏联已有大批的工业、农业、运输业和商业中的杰出的革新者和科学发明家获得了这个荣誉。单是在战后年代中获得这一称号的就有六千五百多人。他们的先进经验和方法已在千百万苏联人民中推广。例如，顿尼兹煤区的一个矿工组组长伊·瓦利古拉，由于发明了一种方法使煤产量增加将近一倍，获得了社会主义劳动英雄的称号。苏联科学院副院长伊·巴尔金、特·李森科院士等著名的科学家，以及列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河的许多建筑者也都得到了这种荣誉。
    今年，有几十个集体农民、联合机操使者和国营农场工作者获得了社会主义劳动英雄的称号。其中有乌克兰集体农庄工作组组长玛·马尔特松（她所管理的田地每公顷产六万零六百公斤甜菜）；联合机操使者普·涅克托夫（他在今年收获了一千六百多公顷谷物）。此外，还有许多人因杰出的工作两次获得这个最高的荣誉。凡两度获得社会主义劳动英雄称号的工作者，他的故乡还要给他竖立半身铜像。
