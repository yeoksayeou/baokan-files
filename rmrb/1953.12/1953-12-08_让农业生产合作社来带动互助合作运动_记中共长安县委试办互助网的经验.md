Let Agricultural Production Cooperatives Lead the Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement
—An Account of the Experience of the CCP Chang'an County Committee in Piloting a Mutual Aid Network
Zhang Dingzhao, Lü Zhengting

The End of "Glorious Isolation"

In Shaanxi Province, when mentioning model villages, one cannot ignore the Xiwangmang Village of the Eighth Township in the Duqu District of Chang'an County. This village has a total of 167 households. Now, it has one agricultural production cooperative and sixteen permanent mutual aid teams. In other words, 94% of the farmers have been organized. Production increases year after year, and living standards rise year after year. The village has also produced two famous labor models: Pu Zhongzhi and Yi Jidong. The civil school in Xiwangmang Village is full of large and small prize banners. Last year, when the nation evaluated high-yield farms, it also won the glorious title of high-yield team (the joint team of the whole village).

However, there was a time when Xiwangmang Village, famous far and wide, was "gloriously isolated" nearby. Farmers within a radius of four or five miles did not believe the fact that Xiwangmang Village's densely planted rice yielded more than 100 jin per mu than ordinary rice paddies. Even some mutual aid teams and village cadres were jealous. Some members of the mutual aid teams in Jiang Village, only three miles away from Xiwangmang Village, said sarcastically: "They are walking fast, let's walk slower, we won't follow them!" In this way, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Xiwangmang Village was separated from the surrounding villages. The development of mutual aid teams in the surrounding villages was also uneven. Some collapsed, some stagnated, and production always increased very slowly.

This kind of imbalance is also common in the mutual aid and cooperation movement in other places.

The CCP Chang'an County Committee found the root of this problem: the Party did not yet know how to use the method of combining points and areas in leading the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

During the county-wide cadre meeting in February this year, when deploying spring production, Comrade Li Hao, Secretary of the County Committee, advocated a leadership method that combined points and areas. Then, the County Committee decided to take the Pu Zhongzhi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiwangmang Village as the center and pilot a mutual aid network, so that the agricultural production cooperative could drive the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the surrounding villages. Cao Jingjian, the Organization Member of the Duqu District Committee, was also sent to serve as the secretary of the Eighth Township Branch, to lead the agricultural production cooperative and pilot the mutual aid network at the same time.

Eight months of piloting have indeed yielded results and experience. Xiwangmang Village has become the core of the surrounding villages, Pu Zhongzhi has become a model for the surrounding farmers, and the agricultural production cooperative has become a banner for the surrounding mutual aid and cooperation movement. The two major experiences of Xiwangmang Village—advanced production technology and mutual aid organization experience—have gone out, universally raising this year's surrounding rice yields to a new level.

How the Mutual Aid Network Was Organized

Before the establishment of the mutual aid network, Comrade Cao Jingjian, Secretary of the Township Branch, together with two comrades from the working group piloting the mutual aid network, went deep into the surrounding six villages, convened village cadres and key mutual aid teams to hold meetings, investigated and researched the mutual aid and cooperation organizations, farming techniques, and problems; on the other hand, they publicized the good experiences of Xiwangmang Village, changed their incorrect views on Xiwangmang Village, and inspired them to consciously and voluntarily learn from Xiwangmang Village. Before this, the fact that Xiwangmang Village's dense planting of rice increased production had already spread, and people from outside the area kept coming to visit, which somewhat moved the surrounding mutual aid teams. At this time, when they heard that they were going to organize a mutual aid network, everyone was naturally happy to participate. Zhang Zhende, a member of the mutual aid team in Dongwangmang Village, said: "People from Lantian County are coming to learn, why don't we learn when we are so close?" (Note: Dong and Xiwangmang Villages are less than two li apart). Xia Chengfu, the head of the Liu Li Village mutual aid team, also immediately stated: "As long as Xiwangmang Village takes the trouble to guide us, we must learn to do a good job in the mutual aid team and production." Some mutual aid team leaders also reviewed their conservative thinking, saying that they would not only study Xiwangmang Village well, but also take the lead in publicizing it to the masses.

The mutual aid network was organized in late March after such investigation, research, publicity, and mobilization. At the meeting to establish the mutual aid network, everyone elected Pu Zhongzhi as the person in charge. At the beginning, only six villages and seven mutual aid teams participated, but now it has increased to ten villages and nineteen mutual aid teams.

Methods and Achievements of Carrying Out the Work of the Mutual Aid Network

First, in combination with the agricultural season, study and promote Xiwangmang Village's agricultural farming techniques and mutual aid and cooperation experience. There have been a total of nine such studies in the mutual aid network: one for combining agriculture and sideline occupations, one for "combined-style" seedling beds, one for dense planting of rice, one for treating rice stem borers, one for summer harvest competition, one for summer harvest summary, one for wheat high-yield summary, one for mutual aid team leaders' leadership methods (mainly how to cultivate active members in the team), and one for autumn harvest and autumn planting. Because these studies and promotion work are closely combined with the agricultural season, and proceed from the local specific conditions, grasping the key problems, the results are very significant. To give a few examples:

At the end of April, it was the rice seedling season. Most of the farmers in the surrounding villages still used the old-fashioned method of sowing seeds on the entire mu of nursery. Even in Xiwangmang Village, 60% still used this old-fashioned method of seedling raising. The mutual aid network held a meeting to study and promote Chen Yongkang's "combined-style seedling bed", that is, using seedling beds four to five feet wide to facilitate catching insects and weeding. As a result, more than 60% of the seedling fields in the surrounding villages (including some individual households) adopted this advanced seedling raising method. Jiang Village, the largest and most backward, also reached 60%, while Xiwangmang Village reached 90%. Although some seedling beds did not achieve great results due to not being up to standard, most of the seedlings grew very strong, and everyone learned the secret of "healthy mother, strong child" from then on.

When it came to the rice transplanting season in May, the mutual aid network held a meeting to study "rational close planting" and advanced farming methods such as rational fertilization and rational watering in stages. In previous years, the distance between rice plants in the surrounding villages was generally more than one foot, and some were even as sparse as one foot six inches. The masses firmly believed in the old farmers' saying: "Sparse rice for eating, dense rice for looks", but in fact, the yield was very low. The mutual aid network studied and decided to promote Xiwangmang Village's experience of eight to nine inches between plants, while correcting the over-dense bias of five to six inches between plants in some rice paddies in the village (over-density is not suitable for local soil conditions). Most of the mutual aid teams in the surrounding areas accepted this "rational close planting" method, and indeed generally increased production. Taking Liuxiu Village as an example, in the past, almost no one knew about "rational close planting", but this year, 80% of the rice paddies basically achieved "rational close planting", and the yield also increased from the average of two dan and two dou (each dou is equivalent to 25 market jin) last year to two dan and eight dou. He Yuegui's mutual aid team reached three dan and five sheng.

When the wheat harvest season was approaching, in previous years, this was the "summer collapse" season for mutual aid teams. The reason for the collapse was mostly the inability to resolve issues such as the order of doing work, work point calculation, and meals. The mutual aid network studied the experience of Xiwangmang Village. In order to solve the problem of work point calculation and meals, it was determined to "calculate work points according to land, provide meals according to work points, unified accounting, more refunds and less compensation"; in order to solve the contradiction of the order of doing work, it was determined to "first far then near, first high (land) then low (land), first sandy (land) then flat (land), first yellow (early ripening) then green (late ripening)", and the work ticket system (a simple method of calculating work points and accounting) created by Xiwangmang Village was promoted. As a result of implementing these methods, "summer collapse" became "summer consolidation". Taking Jiang Village as an example, this village organized 48 mutual aid teams in the spring of last year, but only 22 remained for the summer harvest, and only two remained after the autumn harvest; but the 14 mutual aid teams that were restored this year have not been disbanded to this day.

In previous years, during the "slack farming" season, many mutual aid team members went into the mountains to engage in sideline occupations. No one applied fertilizer to the rice paddies, and no one weeded the wheat fields. When harvesting, the crops were so "rotten" that it was discouraging, and they had to disband. In April, the mutual aid network studied how to combine agriculture and sideline occupations, and decided to adopt Xiwangmang Village's method of taking agriculture as the main occupation and sideline occupations subordinate to agriculture, and stipulated that sideline occupations should be accounted for on a piece-rate basis. After returning, the key team leaders rectified the mutual aid teams according to this principle and method. As a result, agriculture and sideline occupations were combined, and the mutual aid teams were consolidated. Members of the Yao Dongcheng mutual aid team in Liulin Village, who went out to engage in sideline occupations, earned a net profit of 3 million yuan in the spring alone. The team members at home cultivated the crops of the entire team very well. The team members happily said: "Building a good neighbor (Note: referring to Xiwangmang Village) means learning a good method."

Second, on-site observation of farming techniques. After each study of farming techniques, the mutual aid network organized the team leaders and cadres of the key teams participating in the network to observe the crops of Xiwangmang Village. For example, when studying "combined-style seedling beds", some people did not know how to do it, so Pu Zhongzhi led everyone to visit the seedling beds, explaining a series of common sense about seedling beds. When studying "rational close planting", everyone was organized to visit the densely planted fields in Xiwangmang Village, while explaining the methods of correcting too sparse and too dense plantings, the time, type, and amount of rational fertilization in stages, and mastering the appropriate degree of frequent and shallow watering.

The most effective observation was the treatment of rice stem borers. In May, rice stem borers were prevalent in the wheat fields of various villages. Most of the masses did not know how to treat them. Some people did not even recognize the insects. Pu Zhongzhi tied a bug-catching net and pulled out a pile of insects in the wheat field of the agricultural production cooperative. The mutual aid network followed up with a meeting to study and organize everyone to visit the method of tying nets and pulling insects. After returning, the team leaders and cadres also tied nets and pulled insects, personally demonstrating. Some cadres also used magnifying glasses to let the masses recognize the shape of the insects, inspiring the masses' enthusiasm for pest control. The villages immediately launched a pest control campaign, quickly eliminating the rice stem borers and ensuring the bumper harvest of nearly a thousand mu of wheat fields.

Third, from point to area, from area to point, concentrate and persist. The Pu Zhongzhi Agricultural Production Cooperative is the central point of the entire mutual aid network. The 19 mutual aid teams participating in the network are the key teams in each village, that is, the central point of the mutual aid network within the village. These key teams also affect 80 to 90 permanent mutual aid teams and temporary mutual aid teams. In this way, a large network surrounding small networks and small networks connecting to large networks is formed, which facilitates the role of combining points and areas and promoting layer by layer. Each time the mutual aid network studies work, Pu Zhongzhi analyzes and studies the situations and problems raised by the team leaders based on the experience of Xiwangmang Village, proposes solutions, obtains everyone's agreement, and then the key team leaders bring them back to each village to convene the mutual aid teams in the village for publicity and promotion. Regarding farming techniques, they also strive to reach and deepen the understanding of individual households through the mutual aid teams. When the mutual aid network holds a meeting, it conducts inspections and summaries, corrects shortcomings, affirms advantages, and then persists and promotes them. For example, the summer harvest competition method, the summer harvest summary, and the wheat high-yield summary adopt this method of going from point to area, from area to point, concentrating and persisting. The work ticket system and other experiences created by Xiwangmang Village have been repeatedly tried, summarized, and promoted from a few mutual aid teams to most mutual aid teams season by season through the spring, summer, and autumn agricultural seasons, which plays a great role in consolidating the mutual aid teams and developing production.

Fourth, the Party and the government closely cooperate and actively lead, ensuring the steady progress of the mutual aid network. First, the leadership of the Party and the leading role of Party members play a decisive role in the process of giving play to the role of the mutual aid network. The Chang'an County Committee appointed Comrade Cao Jingjian, Secretary of the Eighth Township Branch of Duqu District, to guide the branch work of each township in the mutual aid network at the same time. Before each time the mutual aid network studies problems, he always travels to various townships to pre-negotiate with the township branch secretaries and Party members, or convene the township branch secretaries to discuss and assist the mutual aid network in studying problems. After the mutual aid network studies and decides, he goes back to coordinate with the township and village cadres and key team leaders to carry out in-depth publicity and promotion. And he often conducts individual education with Party members in various villages. Under the leadership of Comrade Cao Jingjian, many Party members have played a leading role in the mutual aid network. Zhao Yuting, a Communist Party member in Hongmiaohe Village, saw that the masses were hesitant when promoting "rational close planting" of rice, so he took the lead and first achieved close planting with a plant spacing of eight to nine inches (more than one foot in previous years), and indeed the yield per mu increased by 125 jin compared to last year. When the rice was harvested to the field, he organized the masses to observe, which broke the wait-and-see mentality of the masses, and many people said that they would definitely follow his method of close planting next year. In May, when treating wheat stem borers, he first tied nets and pulled insects, organized the masses to visit, and promoted the pest control campaign. Yang Shenglin, a Communist Party member in Jiang Village, used the same close planting method, which increased the yield per mu by 200 jin compared to last year, and the masses came to him to "ask for advice".

Special mention should be made of Pu Zhongzhi, who is the director of the agricultural production cooperative and a Communist Party member. In addition to leading everyone to study problems on the mutual aid network, he also takes time to go to nearby villages to help rectify the mutual aid teams and guide farming techniques. The Yao Dongcheng mutual aid team in Liulin Village is the key team in the village. Team leader Yao Dongcheng is also the team leader of the mutual aid joint team. But in the past, he only cared about his own team and was not united with other teams and village cadres. Pu Zhongzhi patiently educated him, criticized his selfish ideas and departmentalism, focused on explaining the importance of contacting the masses, and taught him leadership methods. Now, Yao Dongcheng has indeed become an excellent joint team leader.

Under the unified leadership of the Party, the township and village cadres in the mutual aid network have also strengthened their specific leadership over the mutual aid teams and carried out a series of organizational work. Before and after each time the mutual aid network studies problems, the cadres (some key team leaders also serve as production team leaders, township government committee members, people's representatives, etc.) first collect the opinions and experiences of the masses, and then coordinate with the key team leaders to publicize, promote, and solve specific difficulties. For example, when treating rice stem borers, many cadres personally went to the towns to buy gauze to help the masses tie nets, personally pulled and burned insects in the wheat fields, mobilized the masses to observe, and mobilized the masses to launch a pest control campaign.

Due to the close cooperation and active leadership of the Party and the government, not only has the steady development of the mutual aid network been ensured, but also the backbone elements such as Pu Zhongzhi and the leaders of various mutual aid teams have been able to focus their main efforts on improving mutual aid and cooperation organizations and improving production technology, reducing general organizational work and administrative work, consolidating key points, ensuring the banner, continuously gaining experience, and continuously promoting experience, so that the mutual aid network is rooted in a solid foundation and develops steadily and sustainably.

The Mutual Aid Network Has Improved the Leadership of Agricultural Production

The piloting of the mutual aid network has, on the one hand, improved the mutual aid and cooperation movement and agricultural production technology, and increased agricultural production; on the other hand, it has also improved the leadership of agricultural production. To illustrate this point, it is enough to introduce the changes of Comrade Cao Jingjian, which can represent the situation of ordinary cadres.

Before piloting the mutual aid network, Comrade Cao Jingjian also engaged in rural work for several years, read the three major documents, and talked about "leading mutual aid and cooperation is the central task of the Party", but once he got to the countryside, family disputes, mass disputes, and marriage problems squeezed out the "central task". He ran to several townships a day, asked a few questions, and left. When the masses asked him how the mutual aid team calculates work points and how to densely plant rice, he couldn't answer. Cao Jingjian only came here to work in 1949. He had never even seen what rice looked like, let alone how to densely plant it; he hadn't made efforts to learn from the masses. He could only resist whatever the higher-ups said, and he couldn't solve practical problems. Over time, he felt that rural work was impossible and very distressed.

Since piloting the mutual aid network, Comrade Cao Jingjian has found that his work style has also undergone great changes.

First, he clearly recognized that the central task of the rural Party branch is to lead the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and understood that "combining points and areas" is an important method for carrying out the mutual aid and cooperation movement and promoting advanced production technology, overcoming the generalized leadership style of "grasping everything at once" and the working method of grasping key points in isolation in the past.

Second, he learned a set of agricultural production techniques. Since the time of piloting the mutual aid network, he has conscientiously followed Pu Zhongzhi to study while researching, and tried seedling raising, dense planting, pest control, and harvesting rice with the mutual aid team, from which he learned many practical skills. Now, the masses and cadres welcome him when they see him, saying that he is no longer an "empty talker".

Third, he learned a set of methods for leading and organizing mutual aid teams. In the three years of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, Xiwangmang Village has accumulated and created many experiences and methods. Comrade Cao Jingjian helped Pu Zhongzhi summarize and promote them on the one hand, and personally tried them when rectifying the mutual aid team in Jiang Village on the other hand, enriching his experience and knowledge. He said: "Now there are more new problems and the masses have experience, and it is no longer effective to shout empty slogans of 'three major principles and five major combinations'."

Persist, Promote

Although the mutual aid network is still of a pilot nature and the experience is not perfect, and the CCP Chang'an County Committee's conscious and frequent guidance is not enough, it should be affirmed that the piloting of the mutual aid network is basically successful. As long as we continue to strengthen leadership, summarize it, persist in it, and promote it, it will be a good start for further carrying out the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the future, guiding the broad masses of peasants onto the road of collectivization, and completing the socialist transformation of agriculture.

    让农业生产合作社来带动互助合作运动
    ——记中共长安县委试办互助网的经验
    张定照  吕正庭
    “光荣孤立”结束了
    在陕西境内，数起模范村庄，撇不开长安县杜曲区八乡的西王蟒村。这个村庄总共有一百六十七户人家，如今却有一个农业生产合作社，十六个常年互助组。换句话说，已经有百分之九十四的农户组织起来了。生产年年增加，生活年年上升。村里还出了两个有名的劳动模范：一个是蒲忠智，一个是益冀东。西王蟒村的民校里，挂满了大大小小的奖旗。去年全国评丰产，又得了个丰产组（全村的联组）的光荣称号。
    可是，曾经有一个时期，名扬千里的西王蟒村在近处却是“光荣孤立”。方圆四、五里内的农民，对西王蟒村水稻密植后每亩比一般稻田多收一百多斤的事实不相信，甚至有些互助组和村干部心存嫉妒。离西王蟒村只有三里地的江村的有些互助组组员曾经冷言冷语地说：“人家走得快，咱们慢些走，不跟他！”就这样，西王蟒村的互助合作运动跟周围村庄脱了节。周围村庄互助组的发展也不平衡，有的垮了，有的停顿了，产量总是增加得很慢。
    这种不平衡的毛病，在其他地方的互助合作运动中，也是普遍有的。
    中共长安县委找出了这种毛病的根子：党在领导互助合作运动中，还不懂得使用点面结合的方法。
    县委书记李浩同志在今年二月间全县干部会议上布置春季生产时，提倡点面结合的领导方法。接着县委确定以西王蟒村蒲忠智农业生产合作社为中心，试办了一个互助网，让农业生产合作社来带动周围村庄的互助合作运动。还派了杜曲区委组织委员曹景俭同志去担任八乡支部书记，一面领导农业生产合作社，一面试办互助网。
    八个月的试办，果然得到了成绩和经验。西王蟒村成了周围村庄的核心，蒲忠智成了周围农民的榜样，农业生产合作社成了周围互助合作运动的旗帜。西王蟒村的两大经验——先进生产技术跟互助组织经验——出了门，把今年的周围水稻产量普遍提高到新的水平上。
    互助网怎样组织起来
    成立互助网之前，乡支部书记曹景俭同志协同两个试办互助网的工作组同志，深入周围六个村庄，召集村干部和重点互助组开会，一面调查研究互助合作组织、耕作技术情况和问题；另一面宣传西王蟒村的好经验，改变了他们对西王蟒村的不正确看法，启发他们自觉自愿地向西王蟒村学习。在这以前，西王蟒村水稻密植增产的事实已经传开了，并且外区不断有人来参观，多少使周围互助组动了心。这时候，一听说要组织互助网，大家自然乐意参加。东王蟒村互助组组员张振德说：“蓝田县都来人学习，咱们离这么近（按：东西王蟒村相距不到二里），为啥不学呢？”刘李村互助组长夏成富也马上表示：“只要西王蟒村费心指导，咱们一定要学习把互助组和生产搞好。”有些互助组长还检讨了自己思想保守，表示不但要好好学习西王蟒村，还要带头向群众宣传。
      互助网就是经过这样调查研究、宣传动员，在三月底组织起来了。在成立互助网的会议上，大家推举蒲忠智为负责人，开头参加的只有六个村庄、七个互助组，到现在已增加到十个村庄、十九个互助组了。
    开展互助网工作的办法和成绩
    第一，结合农业季节，研究和推广西王蟒村农业耕作技术和互助合作经验。像这样的研究，在互助网里一共有过九次：农副业结合一次，合式秧田一次，水稻密植一次，治吸浆虫一次，夏收竞赛一次，夏收总结一次，小麦丰产总结一次，互助组长领导方法（主要是如何培养组内积极分子）一次，秋收秋播一次。因为这些研究和推广工作跟农业季节紧密结合，并且从当地具体情况出发，抓住了关键问题，所以收效很大。举几个例子来讲：
    四月底，正是水稻育秧时节，周围各村大部分农民依旧采用旧式的整亩撒籽育秧法。就是西王蟒村，也还有百分之六十采用这种旧式育秧法。互助网便开会研究推广陈永康的“合式秧田”、即采用四尺到五尺宽的秧床，以便利捉虫、拔草，结果，周围各村百分之六十以上的秧田（有些单干户的秧田也在内）都采用了这个先进育苗法，最大又最落后的江村，也达到了百分之六十，西王蟒村则达到了百分之九十。虽然有一部分秧床由于不够标准而收效不大，大部分秧苗都长得十分茁壮，大家从此懂得了“母肥子壮”的诀窍。
    到了五月插秧的时节，互助网便开会研究“合理密植”和分期合理施肥、合理浇水等先进作务法。往年，周围村庄的水稻每棵距离一般都在一尺以上，有的甚至稀到一尺六寸。群众深信老辈子的农谚：“稀谷吃饭，稠谷好看”，其实产量很低。互助网研究确定推广西王蟒村每棵距离八寸到九寸的经验，同时纠正了该村某些稻田每棵距离五寸到六寸的过密偏向（过密不适合当地土地条件）。周围大部分互助组接受了这个“合理密植”法，果然一般都增加了产量。拿刘秀村来说，往年几乎没有人知道“合理密植”，今年却有百分之八十的稻田基本上作到了“合理密植”，产量也从去年的平均二石二斗（每斗合二十五市斤）提高到今年的二石八斗，何月贵互助组达到了三石零五升。
    麦收时节快到了，往年，这时正是互助组“夏垮台”时节，垮的原因，多半是作活先后，计工管饭等问题不能解决。互助网研究了西王蟒村的经验，为了解决计工管饭问题，确定“按地计工，按工管饭，统一算账，多退少补”；为了解决作活先后的矛盾，确定“先远后近，先高（地）后低（地），先沙（地）后川（地），先黄（早熟）后绿（迟熟）”，并且推广了西王蟒村创造的工票制（计工算账的简便办法）。实行这些办法的结果，“夏垮台”变成了“夏巩固”。再拿江村来说，这村去年春天组织起四十八个互助组，到夏收剩下了二十二个，秋收毕，只剩下两个了；可是今年恢复起来的十四个互助组，到现在再没散过伙。
    往年“农闲”季节，许多互助组组员都进山搞副业，水稻没人上粪，麦地没人锄草，到收割时，庄稼“烂”得教人丧气，又只好散伙。四月间，互助网研究农业副业怎样结合，确定采取西王蟒村农业为主、副业服从农业的办法，并规定副业按件计工办法。重点组长回去后，按照这个原则和办法整顿了互助组，结果，农副业结合了，互助组也巩固了。柳林村姚东成互助组出外搞副业的组员，单是春季就净赚了三百万元，在家的组员把全组的庄稼务育得挺美，组员们高兴地说：“搭个好邻居（按：指西王蟒村），学到好办法。”
    第二，实地观摩耕作技术。互助网每次研究耕作技术后，都要组织参加网的重点组组长和干部观摩西王蟒村的庄稼，比如研究“合式秧田”时，有些人不知道怎样作法，就由蒲忠智带领大家去参观秧床，解释有关秧床的一系列常识，研究“合理密植”时又组织大家参观西王蟒村密植种田，同时解释纠正太稀太稠的方法、分期合理施肥的时间、种类和数量，掌握勤浇浅浇的适度。
    观摩收效最大的一次是治吸浆虫。五月间，各村麦地普遍发生吸浆虫。大部分群众不知道怎样治。有些人甚至连虫也不认得。蒲忠智便绑了一个拉虫网，在农业生产合作社的麦地里拉下一堆虫。互助网紧跟着开会研究，组织大家参观绑网拉虫的办法。各组长和干部回去后，又绑网拉虫，亲自示范。有的干部还用放大镜让群众认识虫的形状，激发群众治虫热情，各村立即发动了治虫运动，很快把吸浆虫基本上消灭了，保证了近千亩麦地的丰收。
    第三，从点到面，从面到点，集中起来、坚持下去。蒲忠智农业生产合作社是整个互助网的中心点，参加网的十九个互助组，又是各村的重点组，也就是村范围内互助网的中心点，这些重点组又影响着八、九十个常年互助组和临时互助组。这样，就形成了大网套小网、小网连大网，便于发挥点面结合、层层推动的作用。互助网每次研究工作，都由蒲忠智根据各组长所提出的情况和问题，根据西王蟒村的经验，加以分析研究，提出办法，得到大家同意，再由重点组长带回各村，召集村内互助组宣传、推广。有关耕作技术方面的，并通过各互助组去影响单干户，力求普遍深入。等到互助网开会时，进行检查总结，改正缺点，肯定优点，再坚持、推广下去。如夏收竞赛办法、夏收总结、小麦丰产总结，就是采取这种从点到面、从面到点，集中起来、坚持下去的方法。西王蟒村所创造的工票制等经验，经过春、夏、秋三个农业季节的反复试行、总结，已由少数互助组逐季推广到大部分互助组里去，这对于巩固互助组、发展生产，起着很大的作用。
    第四，党、政紧密配合，积极领导，保证互助网稳步前进，首先党的领导和党员的带头作用，在发挥互助网作用的过程中起着决定作用。长安县委指派担任杜曲区八乡乡支部书记曹景俭同志，同时指导着互助网内各乡的支部工作。他在每次互助网研究问题之前，总是奔走各乡，跟乡支部书记和党员事先酝酿，或召集乡支部书记商量，协助互助网研究问题。互助网研究决定后，他又回去协同乡、村干部和重点组长深入宣传、推广。并经常和各村党员进行个别教育，在曹景俭同志领导下，许多党员在互助网内起了带头作用。红庙河村的共产党员赵玉亭，在推广水稻“合理密植”时，看到群众犹豫不定，便以身作则，首先作到株距八、九寸的密植（往年在一尺以上），果然每亩比去年增产一百二十五斤。稻子收割到场上，他又组织群众观摩，这一来，打破了群众的观望心理，许多人表示明年一定要照他的办法密植。在五月间治麦地吸浆虫时，他又首先绑网拉虫，组织群众来参观，推动了治虫运动。江村的共产党员杨生林，用同样的密植方法，使每亩产量比去年增产二百斤，群众纷纷来向他“请教”。
    特别应当提到蒲忠智，他是农业生产合作社主任，也是共产党员。除了在互助网上领导大家研究问题，他还抽时间到近村去帮助整顿互助组，指导耕作技术。柳林村的姚东成互助组，是村里的重点组。组长姚东成又是互助联组组长。但他过去只管自己的组，跟其他组和村干部不团结。蒲忠智对他进行了耐心的教育，批评了他的自私思想和本位主义，着重解释了联系群众的重要性，并教给他领导方法。现在，姚东成果然变成了一个优秀的联组组长。
    在党的统一领导下，互助网内的乡、村干部也加强了对互助组的具体领导，进行了一系列的组织工作。在互助网每次研究问题前后，干部们（有些重点组长分别兼生产组长、乡政府委员、人民代表等职）事先要搜集群众的意见和经验，事后协同重点组长宣传、推广，解决具体困难。例如在治吸浆虫时，许多干部亲自到市镇上去买纱布，帮助群众绑网，亲自在麦地里拉虫、烧虫，动员群众观摩，直到发动群众展开治虫运动。
    由于党、政紧密配合，积极领导，不但保证了互助网稳步的发展，而且使蒲忠智、各互助组组长等骨干分子能够把主要力量放在改进互助合作组织和改进生产技术上面，减少了一般组织工作和事务工作，巩固重点，确保旗帜，不断取得经验，不断推广经验，把互助网扎在牢固的基础上，持久地稳步地发展下去。
    互助网改进了农业生产的领导工作
    互助网的试办，一方面提高了互助合作运动和农业生产技术，增加了农业产量；另一方面，也改进了农业生产的领导工作。为了说明这一点，只要介绍一下曹景俭同志的变化，就可以代表一般干部的情况了。
    在试办互助网以前，曹景俭同志也搞了几年农村工作，也看过三大文件，也讲过“领导互助合作是党的中心任务”，可是一到农村里，家庭纠纷呀，群众纠纷呀，婚姻问题呀，就把“中心任务”挤掉了，一天跑几个乡，问问就走。碰上群众问他互助组怎样计工算账，水稻怎样密植等等，就答不上来。一九四九年，曹景俭才到这里来工作，水稻是啥样子，见也没见过，更谈不上怎样密植了；自己也没下过功夫向群众学习。只好上面说个啥，下来抗个啥，解决不了实际问题。时间长了，他感到农村工作没法搞，很苦恼。
    自从试办互助网以来，曹景俭同志发现自己的工作作风也起了大变化。
    首先，明确地认识了农村党支部的中心任务是领导互助合作运动，并且懂得了“点面结合”是开展互助合作运动、推广先进生产技术的重要方法，克服了过去“头发胡子一把抓”的一般化领导作风和孤立抓重点的工作方法。
    其次，学会了一套农业生产技术，从试办互助网的时候起，他就踏踏实实地跟上蒲忠智边研究、边学习，跟互助组一起试行育秧、密植、治虫、捞稻子，从中学到了许多切实的本领，现在，群众和干部见了他，都欢迎，说他不再是“空话袋子”了。
    再次，学会了一套领导、整理互助组的办法。西王蟒村在三年互助合作运动中，积累和创造了不少经验和办法。曹景俭同志一面帮助蒲忠智加以总结、推广，一面从头学习；又亲自在江村整顿互助组时试行，丰富了自己的经验和知识，他说：“现在新问题多了，群众经验也有了，再空喊‘三大原则，五大结合’就吃不开了。”
    坚持下去，推广开去
    互助网虽然还是试办性质，经验还不完善，中共长安县委有意识地作经常的指导也不够，但应当肯定互助网的试办基本上是成功的。只要继续加强领导，并加以总结，坚持下去，推广开去，对于今后进一步开展互助合作运动，把广大农民引上合作化的道路，完成农业的社会主义改造，将是一个良好的开端。
