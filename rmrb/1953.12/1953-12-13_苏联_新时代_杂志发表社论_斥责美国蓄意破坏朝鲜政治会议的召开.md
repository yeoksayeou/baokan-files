    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 11th: The "New Times" magazine published its fiftieth issue editorial, entitled "Who is Delaying the Convening of the Korean Political Conference?" The editorial wrote: The Panmunjom talks on preparing for the Korean political conference have been delayed for six weeks, and there is still no progress. The American representatives are clearly adopting a policy of delaying the convening of the political conference. The Korean and Chinese side put forward a new proposal on November 30th, which included all the issues that must be resolved in order for the political conference to be convened. This proposal is constructive and fully takes into account the opinions put forward by both sides during the negotiations. For example, because the American delegation opposed neutral countries participating in the political conference as a major point of contention, the Korean and Chinese side made concessions on this issue, agreeing that the conference would take a reciprocal form between the two sides, and agreeing that the neutral countries participating in the conference would not participate in voting. In this way, all the excuses put forward by the other side against the participation of neutral countries no longer exist. The new proposal by the Korean and Chinese side once again proves that they sincerely hope to reach an agreement so that the political conference can be convened as soon as possible. However, it is worth noting that the American delegation is still obstructing the process after this proposal was put forward. The American delegation, which has been forced into a corner and had to agree to talk about the basic points of the Korean and Chinese proposal, is attempting to distort the spirit of the proposal in order to cause one pointless dispute after another.
    The "New Times" magazine pointed out: Judging from the situation in Panmunjom, people have sufficient reason to suspect whether American government officials are sincere. They are trying to make people believe that they seem to want peace in Korea, but at the same time they are deliberately delaying the preparations for the political conference. The following fact deepens the suspicion even further, namely, that the United States is also obstructing and undermining the repatriation work stipulated by the armistice agreement. The purpose of undermining the repatriation work is to forcibly detain more than 20,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war.
      "New Times" then wrote: In order to divert world public opinion from the situation in Korea, and in order to maintain the tense situation in the Far East, the American ruling clique does not hesitate to play ugly provocative tricks in the United Nations. With the support of its vassal states, it fabricated a slanderous proposal and forced it through the United Nations General Assembly on December 3rd. This proposal babbled about feeling "very disturbed" and "condemned" the so-called atrocities and abuses of prisoners of war by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. This proposal, fabricated by the Americans who committed countless crimes in the Korean War, insulted the conscience of all mankind. The governments of the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have righteously and severely condemned the American-manipulated majority in the United Nations for once again using the United Nations as a tool to promote its aggressive plans, and lodged a strong protest against the shameful resolution of the United Nations General Assembly.
      "New Times" magazine concluded: The new proposal put forward by the Korean and Chinese side in the bilateral talks contains a basis for convening a political conference that is completely acceptable to both sides. Continuing to obstruct the negotiations in Panmunjom only proves that the United States is deliberately sabotaging the convening of the Korean political conference, which is contrary to the ardent desire of the people of all countries to peacefully resolve the Korean issue.

### 苏联“新时代”杂志发表社论  斥责美国蓄意破坏朝鲜政治会议的召开

    苏联“新时代”杂志发表社论
    斥责美国蓄意破坏朝鲜政治会议的召开
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十一日讯：“新时代”杂志第五十期发表社论，题目是
  “谁在拖延朝鲜政治会议的召开？”社论写道：筹备朝鲜政治会议的板门店会谈已拖延了六周，而事情仍然没有进展。美国代表显然是采取拖延政治会议的召开的方针。朝中方面于十一月三十日提出了一个新的建议，其中包括为了使政治会议得以召开所必须解决的一切问题。这个建议是建设性的，并充分地照顾到双方在谈判过程中所提出的意见。例如，因为美国代表团反对中立国参加政治会议是分歧的主要的一点，朝中方面在这个问题上作了让步，同意会议采取双方对等的形式，并同意参加会议的中立国不参加表决。这一来，另一方提出的反对中立国参加的一切藉口都不存在了。朝中方面这个新建议又一次证明：它们真诚地希望达成协议，以便政治会议能够尽速召开。然而，值得注意的是，美国代表团在这个建议提出后仍然在进行阻挠。已被逼得无路可走、不得不同意谈谈朝中建议基本几点的美国代表团，企图歪曲该建议的精神，想借此引起一次又一次的无谓争执。
    “新时代”杂志指出：从板门店的情况看来，人们有充分的理由怀疑美国政府人士是否有诚意，他们企图使人相信，似乎他们在希望朝鲜和平，但同时他们却又蓄意拖延政治会议的筹备工作。下面一个事实使人更加深了怀疑，即：美国同时还在阻挠和破坏停战协定所规定的对战俘的解释工作。破坏解释工作是为了要强迫扣留两万多名朝中战俘。
      “新时代”接着写道：为了转移世界舆论对朝鲜情况的注意，为了保持远东的紧张局势，美国统治集团不惜在联合国中玩弄丑恶的挑衅伎俩。它在自己的仆从国家的支持下，编造了一个诬蔑性的提案，并且在十二月三日硬抬到联合国大会上来通过，这个提案胡诌什么感到“非常不安”，还“谴责”朝鲜军队和中国人民志愿军对战俘的所谓暴行和虐待。在朝鲜战争中犯下了不可胜数的罪行的美国人所编造出来的这个提案，辱没了全人类的良心。中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府理直气壮地严厉斥责了联合国中美国操纵下的多数又一次把联合国当作推行其侵略计划的工具的行径，并对联合国大会可耻的决议提出了强有力的抗议。
      “新时代”杂志最后写道：双方会谈中朝中方面新提出的建议含有完全可以为双方接受的召开政治会议的基础。继续阻挠板门店的谈判，只是证明美国蓄意破坏朝鲜政治会议的召开，而这是与世界各国人民致力于和平解决朝鲜问题的热望相违背的。
