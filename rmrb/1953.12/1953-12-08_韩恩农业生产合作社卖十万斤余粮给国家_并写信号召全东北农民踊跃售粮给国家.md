    Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative Sells 100,000 Jin of Surplus Grain to the State
    and Writes Letter Calling on All Farmers in Northeast China to Actively Sell Grain to the State
    After studying the general line and general task of the state during the transition period, all members of the Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative in Bao'an Village, Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, unanimously decided to sell 100,000 jin of surplus grain to the state and wrote a letter to all farmers in Northeast China, calling on all farmer brothers in Northeast China to actively sell grain to the state to support national industrial construction.
    The letter first explained that the lives and production of farmers have been continuously improving under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao in recent years. Then, it introduced the situation of the cooperative's increased production and improved living conditions in recent years after listening to Chairman Mao's words and organizing. The letter detailed that Han En, the director of the cooperative, participated in the Chinese Farmers' Delegation to the Soviet Union last April. After returning from the Soviet Union, he reported the happy life of Soviet farmers to the entire cooperative, which inspired everyone's confidence in building socialism. The letter said: "Wang Zhonghe, a farmer from Xinli Village, after hearing Han En talk about the situation in the Soviet Union, went to his relatives' house fifty miles away overnight to bring back his horse and join the cooperative. Chi Dianwu from Bao'an Village used to be afraid that his property would be divided equally when he joined the collective farm and always thought about not working in the cooperative after settling accounts in the autumn of 1952. After hearing Han En's words, he no longer wanted to work alone and mobilized his daughter-in-law to join the agricultural production cooperative. In the past, when talking about "the working class is the leading class," old cooperative member Niu Defang was unconvinced and said: "No matter how good the industry is, if we don't farm, the workers won't have food to eat!" After hearing Han En's report, he realized that if industry does not develop, farmers will not eat well either. Female cooperative member Niu Guizhi used to say: "Workers make machines, we farm, what does it have to do with us?" After hearing Han En's report, she said: "I now understand that if we are separated from the working class, we will not have good cloth to wear or good things to use; as production develops and living standards improve in the future, we will become more and more inseparable from industry." Knowing the path of Soviet farmers eliminated some of our past confused views. Therefore, after recently studying the Party's general line and general task during the transition period, we can see more clearly where our prosperity comes from. All our cooperative members deeply feel that under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, the state's construction and assistance to our farmers is a strong guarantee for the continuous improvement of our lives." The letter continued to say that in recent years, with the strong support of the state, farmers have been using new agricultural tools, chemical fertilizers, and various pesticides, so the yield has increased year after year. If the country is industrialized, farmers will use machines to farm like Soviet farmers and live a better life. The letter said: "We know that if the country is to be industrialized, we farmers need to work hard to increase production, sell surplus grain to the state, turn dead money into live money, and expand production in the coming year."
    The letter concludes: "In order to build our motherland into a prosperous and strong country like the Soviet Union and make our lives as happy as those of Soviet farmers as soon as possible, all the members of our cooperative warmly hope that all farmer brothers in Northeast China will actively sell grain to the state to support national industrial construction."

    韩恩农业生产合作社卖十万斤余粮给国家
    并写信号召全东北农民踊跃售粮给国家
    吉林省蛟河县保安村韩恩农业生产合作社全体社员，学习国家在过渡时期总路线总任务后，全体社员一致决议把十万斤余粮卖给国家，并写信给全东北农民，号召全东北的农民兄弟踊跃地把粮食卖给国家，支援国家工业建设。
    信中首先说明了农民们几年来在共产党和毛主席领导下生活和生产都在不断改善。接着，介绍了该社几年来听了毛主席的话组织起来生产提高和生活改善的情景。信中详细介绍了该社主任韩恩去年四月参加了中国农民访苏参观团，在苏联参观回来向全社报告苏联农民的幸福生活后，鼓舞了大家建设社会主义的信心。信上说：“新立屯的一个农民王中和听了韩恩谈苏联的情形后，连夜到五十里外的亲戚家里把马牵回来，入到合作社里来。保安屯迟殿武，过去老怕到集体农庄时把财产平分了，总想一九五二年秋后算完账就不在合作社里干了。听了韩恩的话以后，他再也不想单干了，并动员他的儿媳妇也参加了农业生产合作社。过去谈到“工人阶级是领导阶级”，老社员牛德芳就不服气地说：“不管他工业怎么样好，咱们不种地，工人也吃不上饭！”听了韩恩的报告，他认识到：若是工业不发展，农民的饭也吃不怎么好。女社员牛桂芝过去说：“工人造机器，我们种地，我们和他们有什么关系？”听了韩恩的报告后，她说：“我现在明白了，我们离开工人阶级就没有好布穿，没有好东西用；到将来生产越发展，生活越要提高，就越离不开工业了。”知道苏联农民的道路，就把我们过去的一些糊涂看法打消了。所以最近全体社员学习党在过渡时期的总路线总任务以后，我们更清楚地看到我们的富裕是从哪里来的。我们全体社员深深觉得在毛主席和共产党领导下，国家建设对我们农民的帮助是我们生活得到不断提高和改善的有力保证。”信中接着说，几年来在国家大力帮助下农民们使上了新式农具、化学肥料、各种农药，所以产量年年增加。如果国家工业化了，农民将像苏联农民那样用机器种地，过着美好的生活。信上说：“我们知道，国家要实行工业化，就需要我们农民努力增产，把余粮卖给国家，把死钱变成活钱，扩大来年生产。”
    这封信最后说：“为了把我们的祖国建设成像苏联一样的繁荣和富强，使我们的生活也早日过到像苏联农民那样幸福，我们全社的社员热烈地希望全东北的农民兄弟们，踊跃地把粮食卖给国家，支援国家工业建设。”       （新华社）
