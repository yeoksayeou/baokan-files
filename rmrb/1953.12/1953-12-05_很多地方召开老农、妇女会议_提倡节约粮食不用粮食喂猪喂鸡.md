Many places, in the movement to increase production and save grain, advocate and promote the use of wild grasses and vegetables to feed pigs, chickens, and ducks, overcoming the wasteful phenomenon of farmers using grain as feed.

The Jinhua Special District Branch of the Zhejiang Provincial Democratic Women's Federation, in order to mobilize farmers to save grain, invited experienced pig-raising farm women from Lanxi, Yiwu, Jinhua, and representatives from five agricultural production cooperatives in Zhuji and other five counties, to hold two pig-raising symposiums. They researched methods of using carrots as the main pig feed, and collecting more waterweeds, water hyacinth, duckweed, and diligently gathering shepherd's purse and other wild crops to compensate for the shortage of summer and autumn feed. The Second District Committee of the CCP Hualian County, Songjiang Province, in order to educate farmers to save grain, advocated using soybean stubble, shriveled grains, etc. as feed for pigs, chickens, and ducks. On November 5th, they jointly held a "Pig Feed Exhibition" with the District Women's Federation in Sima Jiatun, organizing 120 women cadres and 30 village cadres from the entire district to visit. The exhibition displayed eighteen kinds of substitute feeds such as soybean stubble, sorghum husks, corn husks, and rotten potatoes. It also used pictures to illustrate that more than a dozen items such as distiller's grains, lambsquarters, and sugar beet stems could be used to feed pigs. Combining the exhibition, they also commended three old women in Sima Jiatun who consistently did not use grain to feed pigs, chickens, and ducks, and promoted their experiences. In Zhaoyu and Suihua counties, Heilongjiang Province, meetings of old farmers, old women, women, and herdsmen who looked after horses, cattle, sheep, and pigs were convened. Based on their characteristics of being careful in daily life, speaking "appropriately," and directly caring for livestock, propaganda and education were carried out, which promoted the movement to increase production and save grain. Kunshan in Jiangsu, Chong'an and Jian'ou in Fujian, Kunyu and Rongcheng in Shandong, and other places have also promoted the method of using wild grasses and vegetables to feed livestock and poultry. Some places also used specific examples to dispel farmers' concerns that wild grasses and vegetables could not fatten pigs and that wild grasses and vegetables could not be found in winter. Cadres of Xinqiao Township in Jian'ou County invited Zhuo Xuejin, who used wild vegetables and the like to feed pigs, to introduce the pig-raising situation and experience at a mass meeting. Zhuo Xuejin and her neighbor Lü Changying bought two piglets at the same time six months ago. Zhuo Xuejin's pigs were mainly fed with duckweed, sweet potato vine leaves, taro leaves, etc. Because the wild vegetables were washed clean, chopped finely, and cooked thoroughly, and the feeding was quantitative and on time, they are now more than 20 catties heavier than Lü Changying's pigs, which are mainly fed with grain. Regarding the winter feed problem, everyone at the meeting researched that there were things available for pigs to eat for twelve months of the year. From October to February, the main feeds are mustard greens, radish greens, hairy mustard greens, and yellow flower seedlings. Farmers in Kunshan County also have the experience of cutting wild grasses and vegetables to feed pigs all year round. Generally, from October to March of the lunar calendar, they feed rice straw heads, rice seedlings, Aster indicus grass, water parsley, dandelion grass, Rumex crispus grass, sow thistle grass, and Ardisia japonica grass. With the advocacy and promotion of the local Party and government organs in the above-mentioned areas, many masses have begun to study, plan, and implement the use of wild vegetables and wild grasses to replace grain to feed pigs.

    很多地方召开老农、妇女会议
    提倡节约粮食不用粮食喂猪喂鸡
    很多地方在增产节约粮食运动中，提倡与推广用野草、野菜喂猪，喂鸡、鸭，克服农民中用粮食作饲料的浪费现象。
    浙江省民主妇女联合会金华专区分会，为了动员农民节约粮食，曾邀请兰溪、义乌、金华等县有养猪经验的农妇及诸暨等五县五个农业生产合作社的代表，举行了两次养猪座谈会，研究出用红萝卜作为养猪主要饲料和多打捞蕴草、水葫芦、浮萍和勤采田荠等野生作物，弥补夏秋饲料不足的办法。中共松江省桦川县二区区委为了教育农民节约粮食，提倡用豆毛子、谷瘪子等作饲料喂猪和鸡、鸭。并于十一月五日在四马驾屯和区妇联共同举办了“猪食展览会”，组织全区一百二十名妇女干部和三十名村干部参观。会上摆着豆毛子、高粱壳、玉米皮、烂土豆子等十八种代用饲料；并用图画说明了酒糟、灰菜、糖?子等十几样东西都可以喂猪。结合展览会还表扬了四马驾屯三个一贯不用粮食喂猪、喂鸡鸭的老太太，推广了她们的经验。黑龙江省瞻榆、绥化等县，都召开老农、老太太、妇女会及看管马、牛、羊、猪的牧工会议，根据他们过日子仔细，说话“当令”及直接养护牲畜的特点，进行宣传教育，对增产节约粮食运动起了推动作用。江苏的昆山，福建的崇安、建瓯，山东的昆嵛、荣城等地也都推广了用野草、野菜喂养家畜、家禽的办法。有些地方并用具体事例消除农民怕野草野菜不能把猪喂肥和冬季找不到野草野菜的思想顾虑。建瓯县新桥乡干部邀请用野菜等喂猪的卓雪金在群众大会上介绍养猪情况和经验。卓雪金和邻居吕长英两家在六个月以前同时买了两只小猪，卓雪金家的猪主要是用浮萍、蕃薯藤叶、芋头叶等喂的，由于野菜洗得净、切得碎、煮得熟，喂食注意定量定时，现在比吕长英家主要用粮食喂的猪还重二十多斤。对于冬季饲料问题，会上大家研究出了一年十二个月都有可供猪吃的东西。十月到二月主要是芥菜、萝卜菜、毛芥菜、黄花仔等。昆山县农民也有一年四季割野草野菜喂猪的经验，一般在农历十月到三月期间，都喂稻管头草、浆板头草、马兰头草、水河芹、蒲玲丁草、牛舌头草、奶奶草、鹤耳头草等。以上各地经过当地党、政机关的提倡与推广，很多群众已开始研究、计划和实行用野菜、野草代替粮食喂猪。
