    North China Region Exceeds Production Increase and Conservation Plan
    Expected Fiscal Revenue to be Submitted to the State May Exceed Four Trillion Yuan
    [This Newspaper’s Dispatch] The North China Region has exceeded its production increase and conservation plan. The original plan for the region to submit fiscal revenue to the state was 2.8 trillion yuan, but by December, it is expected to complete over 4 trillion yuan, of which industrial and transportation enterprises will contribute over 2 trillion yuan.
    In industry: It is estimated that by the end of the year, the 474 state-owned and local state-owned major factories and mines in the North China Region will complete over 105% of their production value plan. In capital construction projects, general construction projects will complete 93% of the plan, and new construction and expansion projects of state-owned factories and mines will generally complete about 94% of the plan. Half of the projects were completed after the call for increased production and conservation was issued.
    The production increase and conservation campaign in the North China Region's industrial and mining enterprises was closely integrated with improved management, achieving great results. Enterprises in machinery, coal mining, and smelting, focused on strengthening planned management during the competition. The rate of balanced production increased month by month, and output also increased. For example, the equilibrium rate of the Tianjin Bicycle Factory was 82% in August, reaching 96% in November, and the product increased from 5,900 bicycles per month in August to 8,000 in November. Power and papermaking enterprises focused on strengthening technical management, implementing technical and operational procedures, and thus made progress in ensuring safe power supply and improving product quality. For example, as a result of strengthening technical management in the Tianjin Paper Mill, the product qualification rate rose from below 80% to 97%. Among local state-owned industries, some factories undergoing reorganization and mergers had chaotic management systems. Ideological and organizational rectification was carried out in the competition, necessary systems were established, and the outlook of production changed. For example, after rectification, the output of the Beijing Pharmaceutical Factory in October increased by 64% compared to July, and the scrap rate decreased from 13.2% to 8.4%.
    In the production increase and conservation campaign, industrial and mining enterprises in the North China Region also paid special attention to earnestly learning from Soviet experts to improve the technical level of enterprises. After the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China invited Soviet experts to solve the problem of casting sand in Tianjin, the scrap rate was greatly reduced. The scrap rate of castings in the Textile Machinery Factory decreased from 10.2% to 1.19%. The scrap rate of blanks in the Automobile Parts Factory increased from about 35% to full qualification, and the scrap rate after processing decreased from 59% to 11%.
    The work of departments in various industrial and mining enterprises has been improved in the production increase and conservation campaign. According to statistics from Hebei and Shanxi provinces, 80% of technicians and staff participated in the competition. In the competition, various localities strengthened the work of production groups, established a production meeting system, and launched competitions of the same type of work according to the different situations and requirements of industrial and mining development. Among the 1,056 groups in 15 units such as the Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant, the number of advanced production groups before the competition was only one-tenth, now rising to three-tenths. Ninety-seven factories in Tianjin, with 3,012 groups, established a production meeting system.
    Party organizations at all levels played a supervisory and guaranteeing role in the competition. Most of the party members in factories and mines have established plans to lead the masses to complete the production increase and conservation plan. According to inspections in Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi and other places, 90% of the party members completed their plans. At present, the main problems in production management in the North China Region's industrial and mining enterprises are that accidents are still serious. Individual units sometimes rely on shock tactics to complete tasks; not many units fully complete various national indicators; and technical, financial, and cost management are still weak links in most enterprises. The industrial departments and factories and mines in the North China Region are actively preparing for next year's production on the basis of this year's work. The prepared mining faces of state-owned coal mines are sufficient for half a year of production next year; the machinery manufacturing industry has a certain amount of reserves, generally paying attention to the timely maintenance of machinery, and the preparation of raw materials and tools is also relatively adequate, and the production plan for the first quarter has been generally prepared, and workers and staff are gradually mobilized to discuss it.
    In terms of trade and cooperation: State-owned commerce has exceeded the task of submitting profits, and the capital accumulation of cooperatives has also exceeded the original plan. Since the launch of the production increase and conservation campaign, state-owned commerce and cooperatives have made progress in accelerating capital turnover and reducing circulation costs. In particular, state-owned commerce and cooperatives have improved their business thinking and management, and both sides have strengthened business cooperation. In the purchase of cotton and grain, state-owned commerce earnestly implemented the policy of priority, preferential treatment, and credit sales to cooperatives, and took the initiative to help cooperatives develop their business, thereby expanding sales. Cooperatives generally paid attention to organizing local sources of goods, strengthening the supply of means of production, bringing goods to the countryside, and delivering goods to the door, so that goods could directly meet the masses. In addition, small-scale material exchange meetings, exhibitions, and handicraft workers' symposiums were organized, which played a role in promoting the sales of goods, organizing the production of handicrafts, and investigating the needs of the masses.
    In terms of fiscal revenue and expenditure: The financial and economic departments of the North China Region have increased revenue because they paid attention to further mastering financial resources, tapping potential, relying on the masses, resolutely implemented the policy of "resolutely collect what should be collected, and definitely reduce what should be reduced," carried out the struggle against tax evasion, and because the work style of cadres has greatly improved, this year's revenue has increased. Although agricultural tax has been affected by crop failures in some areas, except for legitimate reductions and exemptions, farmers have enthusiastically paid, ensuring that it is put into storage according to national requirements. In reducing expenditure, various localities have implemented the spirit of careful calculation in the production increase and conservation campaign, verified expenditures, resolutely reduced what can be reduced, and at the same time paid attention to concentrating financial resources to ensure the country's key construction, strengthened planning, and opposed blindness, so that less money was spent, but the work has been improved. Financial management can begin to serve to ensure the country's key construction, which is a major improvement in this production increase and conservation campaign.
    This year, the party committees at all levels in the North China Region promoted the production increase and conservation campaign by comprehensively improving the leadership of industry and the leadership of financial and economic work, especially by conducting in-depth education on the general line, which greatly improved the enthusiasm of all the people, thus not only promoting industrial and mining enterprises and financial and economic departments to invest in the upsurge of striving to over fulfill the national plan, but also promoting other departments to actively strengthen their work around economic construction, such as the health department paying attention to improving factory and mine health work, and the cultural and educational departments organizing construction site performances. The production increase and conservation campaign in private enterprises has also achieved results, with more than 800 households and 50,000 workers participating in the competition in the region, making the production increase and conservation a broad mass upsurge throughout the region.
    In order to systematically summarize the experience of the production increase and conservation campaign and strive to better complete the work in the second year of the Five-Year Plan, the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to hold a competition summary meeting of industrial and mining enterprises in late January next year, and a meeting on agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation in early February, so as to better mobilize the people of the region to welcome the new upsurge of industrial and agricultural production in 1954.

    华北区增产节约计划超额完成
    预计上缴国家的财政数字可超过四万亿元
    【本报讯】华北区已超额完成增产节约计划。全区原计划上缴国家的财政数字为二万八千亿元，到十二月止，预计可完成四万亿元以上。其中工业、交通运输企业为二万亿元以上。
    工业方面：华北全区四百七十四个国营、地方国营主要厂矿，预计到年底可完成产值计划百分之一百零五以上。基本建设工程中，一般建筑工程完成计划百分之九十三，国营厂矿的新建、扩建工程，一般完成计划百分之九十四左右，半数工程是在增产节约号召提出以后完成的。
    华北区各工矿企业的增产节约竞赛与改善管理工作密切结合进行，取得了很大的成绩。机器、煤矿、冶炼等企业在竞赛中以加强计划管理为主，生产均衡率月月上升，产量也有增加。如天津自行车厂均衡率在八月份为百分之八十二，十一月份达到百分之九十六，产品由八月份的月产五千九百辆，增加到十一月份的八千辆。电力、造纸等企业，以加强技术管理为主，贯彻了技术、操作规程的教育，因而在保证安全供电上，在提高产品质量上，取得了进步。如天津造纸厂加强技术管理的结果，产品合格率由百分之八十以下，上升到百分之九十七。地方国营工业中，有某些正在改组与合并的工厂，管理制度混乱，竞赛中进行了思想整顿和组织整顿，建立了必要制度，生产面貌改观。如北京制药厂经过整顿后，十月份产量比七月份提高百分之六十四，废品率由百分之十三点二降到百分之八点四。
    在增产节约竞赛中，华北区各工矿企业还特别注意了认真向苏联专家学习，以提高企业的技术水平。天津市许多工厂在中共天津市委聘请苏联专家解决铸件翻砂问题后，废品率大大减少。纺织机器厂铸件报废率由百分之十点二降到百分之一点一九。汽车制配厂毛坯报废率由百分之三十五左右达到全部合格，加工后的报废率由百分之五十九降到百分之十一。
    各工矿企业的科室工作在增产节约竞赛中有了改进。据河北、山西两省的统计，百分之八十的技术人员和职员参加了竞赛。在竞赛中，各地根据工矿工作发展的不同情况与要求，普遍加强了生产小组工作，建立了生产会议的制度，并发动了同工种的竞赛。北京石景山发电厂等十五个单位一千零五十六个小组中，先进的生产小组在竞赛前只不过十分之一，现在上升到十分之三。天津九十七个工厂，有三千零一十二个小组，建立了生产会议的制度。
    各级党的组织在竞赛中发挥了监督保证作用。工厂矿山中的党员大部订立了带动群众完成增产节约计划的计划。据北京、天津、河北、山西等地的检查，百分之九十的党员完成了计划。现在，华北区各工矿企业生产管理中的主要问题是事故仍然严重。个别单位有时还依靠突击的方式来完成任务；全面完成国家各项指标的单位不太多；技术、财务、成本管理工作仍然是多数企业的薄弱环节。华北区各工业部门、各厂矿正在今年工作的基础上，积极进行明年的生产准备工作。国营煤矿准备的回采面，已足供明年半年生产之用；机器制造业制品有了一定数量的储备，一般都注意了机器的按期检修，原料、工具准备也较充足，并普遍编制了第一季度的生产计划，逐步发动职工讨论。
    贸易合作方面：国营商业已超额完成上缴利润任务，合作社的资金积累也超过了原计划。增产节约竞赛开展以来，国营商业和合作社在加速资金周转、减低流转费用等方面有进步。特别是国营商业和合作社在经营思想和经营管理上有改进，双方加强了业务上的配合。在收购棉、粮中，国营商业认真执行了对合作社的优先、优待、赊销政策，并主动帮助合作社开展业务，因而扩大了销售额。合作社方面普遍注意了组织地方货源，加强生产资料的供应，带货下乡，送货上门，使货物能直接与群众见面。此外还组织了小型物资交流会、展览会、手工业者座谈会等，对推销商品、组织手工业品生产和调查群众需要方面，都发挥了作用。
    财政收支方面：华北区财经部门在增加收入上，由于注意进一步掌握财源，挖掘潜力，依靠群众，坚决贯彻了“该征的坚决征，该减的一定减”的政策，进行了反偷税漏税的斗争，以及由于干部的作风有很大进步，今年收入增加。农业税虽受到部分地区歉收的影响，但除合法减免者外，由于农民热情交纳，保证了按国家的要求入库。在减少支出上，各地在增产节约竞赛中贯彻了精打细算的精神，核实开支，坚决削减可以削减的，同时注意集中财力保证国家的重点建设，加强了计划性，反对了盲目性，因而钱花少了，工作却有改进。财政管理上能开始为保证国家的重点建设服务，这是此次增产节约竞赛中的重大改进。
    今年，华北区各级党委从全面改进工业领导与财经工作领导来推动增产节约竞赛，特别是深入地进行了总路线的教育，大大地提高了全体人民的积极性，因而不仅推动工矿企业和财经部门投入了为争取超额完成国家计划的热潮，而且推动其他部门围绕经济建设，积极加强工作，例如卫生部门注意改进厂矿卫生工作，文教部门组织工地演出等。私营企业的增产节约竞赛也有成绩，全区有八百多户、五万工人参加了竞赛，使增产节约在全区范围内形成了广泛的群众性的热潮。
    为了有系统地总结增产节约竞赛的经验，争取更好地完成五年计划第二年的工作，中共中央华北局决定在明年一月下旬召开工矿企业的竞赛总结会议，二月上旬召开农业生产互助合作会议，以便能更好地动员全区人民，迎接一九五四年工农业生产的新高涨。
