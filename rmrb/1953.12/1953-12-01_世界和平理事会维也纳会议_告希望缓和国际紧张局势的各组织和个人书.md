Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 30th—The World Peace Council, at its closing meeting on the 28th, adopted an appeal to all organizations and individuals hoping to ease international tensions.

The World Peace Council’s appeal to all organizations and individuals hoping to ease international tensions stated: The Korean armistice has finally brought the world hope for easing tensions between major powers. However, the negotiations that have begun have encountered new obstacles. Reaching agreements on other issues of great importance to world peace is proving difficult.

However, the people of all countries are eager for the easing of international tensions. The economic barriers and political pressures brought about by this tension are becoming increasingly unbearable.

We believe it is possible to save the world from this situation.

Today, broad political and social forces in various countries are working to improve international relations.

More outstanding scientists and authorities in religious and political circles are expressing opinions condemning the use of weapons of mass destruction. Public opinion is uneasy about the increasing stockpiles of various armaments.

Everyone is gradually realizing that without the participation of the Government of the People's Republic of China, it is impossible to solve problems of world importance or to guarantee the implementation of any agreements.

In most Western European countries, responsible representatives of various political groups have publicly expressed opposition to any form of revival of German militarism.

Under these circumstances, we believe that all organizations or individuals working to ease international tensions should have the opportunity to concentrate their efforts on the issue of easing international tensions. The resolution adopted by the World Peace Council in Vienna on November 28, 1953, illustrates our view on this issue. It is now necessary to jointly prepare a conference to freely exchange views and study possible solutions. An international conference of this nature should be held as soon as possible, as it is itself an important factor in easing international tensions.

    世界和平理事会维也纳会议
    告希望缓和国际紧张局势的各组织和个人书
    【新华社三十日讯】据塔斯社维也纳二十八日讯：世界和平理事会在二十八日闭幕会议上通过了告希望缓和国际紧张局势的各组织和个人书。
    世界和平理事会告希望缓和国际紧张局势的各组织和个人书说：朝鲜停战终于为世界带来了缓和大国间紧张关系的希望。但是，已经开始的谈判又遇到了新的障碍。要在对世界和平十分重要的其他问题上获致协议，证明是有困难的。
    但是，各国人民渴望着国际紧张局势的缓和。这种紧张局势所带来的经济壁垒和政治压力变得日益难以忍受了。
    我们相信挽救世界脱离这种处境是可能的。
    今天，各国广大的政治和社会力量正在为改善国际关系而努力。
    更多的杰出的科学家和宗教界、政治界权威人士发表意见，谴责使用大规模毁灭性武器。舆论对于各种军备囤积数量日益增加感到不安。
    每一个人都逐渐认识到，没有中华人民共和国政府参加，要想解决有世界重要性的问题或保证任何协议的履行是不可能的。
    在大多数西欧国家中，各政治团体的负责代表已经公开表示，反对任何形式的德国军国主义复活。
    在这种种情况下，我们认为，应该让所有为缓和国际紧张局势而努力的组织或个人有机会把力量集中在缓和国际紧张局势这个问题上。世界和平理事会一九五三年十一月二十八日在维也纳通过的决议说明了我们在这个问题上的观点。共同筹备一次会议来自由交换意见和研究可能的解决办法，在现在是必要的。这种性质的国际会议应该尽速举行，它本身就是缓和国际紧张局势的一个重要因素。
