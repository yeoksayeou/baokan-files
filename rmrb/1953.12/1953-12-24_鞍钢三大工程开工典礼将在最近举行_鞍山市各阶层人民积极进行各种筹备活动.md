Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, December 23rd: After the newly built large rolling mill, seamless steel tube plant, and No. 7 blast furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel Company were put into production, the production situation is very good. A grand opening ceremony will be held soon.

　　The newly built large rolling mill, seamless steel tube plant, and the renovated automated blast furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel Company are key construction projects during China's first Five-Year Plan period. With the help of the Soviet government and Soviet experts, these projects were successfully completed one after another in just seven months to a little over a year. After the seamless steel tube plant rolled out the first seamless steel tube on October 27th, it is currently carrying out two-shift trial production; during the hot trial rolling period of the large rolling mill from November 30th to December 15th, most of the large round steel, seamless steel tube billets, and heavy steel rails produced were first-class products; the No. 7 automated blast furnace, renovated with the help of Soviet experts, also successfully produced the first furnace of molten iron on December 19th. Strict technical verification proves that the construction quality of the three major projects is very good; most of the products trial-rolled also meet the specifications. This lays a solid foundation for large-scale formal production.

　　People from all walks of life in Anshan City are joyfully busy carrying out various preparatory activities to welcome the opening ceremony of the three major projects. The conference venue, designed with the help of the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing, is being decorated by staff day and night. Huge banners and thousands of colorful flags have been hung on the main streets of the city and the buildings in the factory area; pairs and rows of lanterns have also been hung at the entrances of various government offices, schools, and shops. In order to educate the workers and the masses of the city about the general line of the transition period through the specific facts of the opening of the three major projects, the director of the seamless steel tube plant gave two reports to all employees, explaining the significance of the opening and production of the three major projects for implementing the general line. The employees of the seamless steel tube plant are rushing to produce propaganda posters and slogans explaining the uses of seamless steel tubes. The Fifth Dormitory Club and the Tiedong Club of Anshan Iron and Steel Company are also actively preparing for a photo exhibition celebrating the completion of the three major projects.

　　The Anshan City Art Troupe and the amateur theater troupes led by various cultural centers and cultural stations are actively rehearsing wonderful programs to celebrate the opening ceremony of the three major projects and to give consolation performances to the workers participating in the construction projects; famous Peking Opera actors Mei Lanfang, Zhou Xinfang, Cheng Yanqiu and Ma Lianliang, who are currently performing in Anshan, are also preparing to stay in Anshan to participate in the performance of the opening ceremony of the three major projects.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, December 23rd: Famous Chinese Peking Opera actors, Mei Lanfang and Zhou Xinfang, Deputy Heads of the Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea; Cheng Yanqiu, Deputy Head of the First Sub-Delegation; and some members of the Peking Opera Troupe of the Korean Comfort Group, including Ma Lianliang, after returning from comforting the front lines in Korea, went to Anshan to give comfort performances to the steel workers and Soviet experts who helped build Anshan Iron and Steel. They have performed continuously for five shows since the 18th.

　　The builders of Anshan watched Mei Lanfang's "Drunken Concubine," "Cosmic Front," Zhou Xinfang's "Beating Yan Song," Cheng Yanqiu's "Three Slaps," Ma Lianliang's "Fisherman's Revenge," and other outstanding programs with excitement and gratitude. Meng Tai, Zhang Mingshan, Wang Chonglun, and four other Anshan City special-class labor models, after watching the performances of Mei Lanfang and others, jointly published their feelings in the local newspaper, expressing that in order to thank the people of the whole country for their support and care for Anshan Iron and Steel, they would strive to continue to build the country's first iron and steel base on the basis of the achievements they have already made, and prepare to build the second and third iron and steel bases.

　　While in Anshan, Mei Lanfang and others visited the large rolling mill, the seamless steel tube plant, the No. 7 blast furnace, and the ironmaking, steelmaking, and primary rolling mills. They will stay in Anshan to participate in the upcoming grand opening ceremony of the large rolling mill, the seamless steel tube plant, and the No. 7 blast furnace.

    鞍钢三大工程开工典礼将在最近举行
    鞍山市各阶层人民积极进行各种筹备活动
    【新华社鞍山二十三日电】鞍山钢铁公司新近建成的大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂和第七号炼铁炉投入生产后，生产情况很好。最近将举行隆重的开工典礼。
    鞍山钢铁公司新建的大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂和改建的自动化炼铁炉，是我国第一个五年计划期间的重点建设工程。这些工程在苏联政府和苏联专家的帮助下，只经过七个月到一年多的时间，就先后胜利建成。无缝钢管厂在十月二十七日轧出第一根无缝钢管以后，正在进行两班制试轧性的生产；大型轧钢厂在十一月三十日开始到十二月十五日的热试轧期间，轧出来的大型圆钢、无缝钢管管胚和重型钢轨等产品，大部分都是一级品；在苏联专家帮助下改建的第七号自动化炼铁炉，也在十二月十九日顺利炼出了第一炉铁水。经过严格的技术检验证明，三大工程的建设质量十分良好；试轧出来的大部分产品，也都合乎规格。这就为大规模的正式生产，打下了稳固的基础。
    鞍山市各阶层人民，为了迎接三大工程的开工典礼，正在喜气洋洋地忙着进行各种筹备活动。由北京中央美术学院帮助设计的大会会场，正由工作人员日夜不停地装饰。市区的主要街道和工厂区的建筑物上，已悬挂起巨幅标语和千百面彩旗；各机关、学校和商店门口，也挂上了成对成排的灯笼。为了通过三大工程开工的具体事实，向工人和全市人民群众进行关于过渡时期总路线的教育，无缝钢管厂厂长向全体职工进行了两次报告，讲解三大工程开工生产对贯彻实现总路线的意义。无缝钢管厂的职工正赶制说明无缝钢管用途的宣传画和标语。鞍山钢铁公司第五宿舍俱乐部和铁东俱乐部，也正在积极筹备庆祝三大工程竣工的图片展览会。
    鞍山市文工团和各文化馆、文化站领导的业余剧团，为了庆祝三大工程开工典礼和向参加建设工程的职工作慰问演出，积极赶排精彩节目；正在鞍山演出的京剧名演员梅兰芳、周信芳、程砚秋和马连良等，也准备继续留在鞍山，参加三大工程开工典礼的演出。
    【新华社鞍山二十三日电】中国著名京剧演员、中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团副总团长梅兰芳、周信芳；第一总分团副团长程砚秋；及赴朝慰问团马连良等京剧团部分人员，自朝鲜前线慰问归来后，到鞍山向钢都职工及帮助鞍钢建设的苏联专家作慰问演出。他们自十八日开始已连续演出了五场。
    鞍山的建设者怀着兴奋和感激的心情观看了梅兰芳的“醉酒”，“宇宙锋”，周信芳的“打严嵩”，程砚秋的“三击掌”，马连良的“打渔杀家”等卓越的节目。鞍山市特等劳动模范孟泰、张明山、王崇伦等七人在看了梅兰芳等的演出后，联名在当地报上发表感想，表示为了答谢全国人民对鞍钢的支援和关怀，要在现在已获得的成就的基础上，为继续建设好祖国第一个钢铁基地，并准备为建设第二个、第三个钢铁基地而努力。
    梅兰芳等在鞍山，曾参观了大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂、七号高炉和炼铁、炼钢、初轧等厂。他们将留在鞍山参加即将举行的大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂和第七号高炉开工盛典。
