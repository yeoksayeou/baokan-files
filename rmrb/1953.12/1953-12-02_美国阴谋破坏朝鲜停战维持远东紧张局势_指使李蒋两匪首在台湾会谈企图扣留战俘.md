    Xinhua News Agency, 30th. Under the direction of the United States, the two political corpses, Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek, held a meeting in Taipei on the 28th. The purpose of this meeting was to plot how to forcibly detain the prisoners of war in Korea who were not directly repatriated, and how to serve the U.S. plot to maintain tensions in the Far East through this act of undermining the Korean armistice.
    Syngman Rhee went to Taiwan from Seoul on the 27th and met with Chiang Kai-shek on the 28th. This pair of unfortunate brothers, beaten black and blue by the Chinese and Korean people, issued a joint statement after the meeting. The joint statement said that they would "do their utmost" to realize the "principle" of forcibly detaining prisoners of war stipulated by their American masters. They also followed Dulles and Nixon's instructions on organizing the Pacific Aggression Group, "urging" other Asian countries to form an "anti-communist united front" with them and jointly carry out the heinous cause of anti-communism and anti-people. American news agencies reported that Syngman Rhee had put forward to Chiang Kai-shek his proposal to forcibly detain prisoners of war in January next year, and had planned with Chiang Kai-shek how to form a U.S., Rhee, and Chiang united front to oppose the people of China and Korea after the armistice was undermined as a result. When Syngman Rhee held a press conference in Taiwan, he once again issued a clamor to resume the war, and said that he would use his troops to drive the Indian guard troops out of Korea.
    The meeting between Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek was entirely instigated and arranged by the United States. Before going to Taiwan, Syngman Rhee held meetings with U.S. Eighth Army Commander Taylor, U.S. Fifth Air Force Commander Anderson, and Seventh Fleet Commander Clark on the 25th. On the 26th, Syngman Rhee held another meeting with Taylor, Arthur Dean, and U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Briggs. On the 27th, Far East U.S. Commander Hull sent Syngman Rhee to Taipei on his special plane. The next day, Dean openly threatened in bilateral talks on the Korean political conference issue: "We are prepared for both peace and war." Taylor also threatened on the 29th that the United States and Syngman Rhee had "common interests" and "can definitely work together." He also said, "We have planned everything properly." Obviously, the United States wants to instigate the Rhee and Chiang gangs to forcibly detain prisoners of war and undermine the Korean armistice, so as to continue to maintain tensions in the Far East.
    However, the United States gathered the armies of sixteen countries plus the Syngman Rhee puppet army and fought for three years on the small Korean peninsula, and still suffered a disastrous defeat. Now it actually attempts to use Syngman Rhee's remnants and Chiang Kai-shek's "bearded soldiers" to clamor and scare people. Isn't it too overestimating itself!

    美国阴谋破坏朝鲜停战维持远东紧张局势
    指使李蒋两匪首在台湾会谈企图扣留战俘
    【新华社三十日讯】在美国导演之下，李承晚和蒋介石这两个政治僵尸在二十八日在台北举行了一次会谈。这次会谈的目的是为了策划如何强迫扣留在朝鲜的不直接遣返的战俘，以及如何通过这一破坏朝鲜停战的行为，替美国的维持远东紧张局势的阴谋服务。
    李承晚在二十七日由汉城前往台湾，二十八日和蒋介石进行会谈。这一对被中朝人民打得头破血流的难兄难弟，在会谈以后发表了一个联合声明。联合声明中说，他们要“竭尽全力”以实现美国主子给他们规定下来的强迫扣留战俘的“原则”。他们并且遵照杜勒斯和尼克松关于组织太平洋侵略集团的指示，“吁请”亚洲其他国家和他们组成“反共联合战线”，共同进行反共反人民的罪恶事业。美国通讯社报道说，李承晚已经向蒋介石提出了他在明年一月份强迫扣留战俘的主张，并且和蒋介石策划了在停战因此而遭到破坏以后，如何结成美、李、蒋联合战线来反对中朝两国人民。李承晚在台湾举行记者招待会时，又发出了恢复战争的叫嚣，并且说他要用他的军队把印度看管部队赶出朝鲜去。
    李承晚和蒋介石的会谈，完全是美国所授意和布置的。李承晚在去台湾以前，曾在二十五日和美军第八军军长泰勒、美国第五航空队司令安德逊、第七舰队司令克拉克等举行会议。二十六日，李承晚又和泰勒以及阿瑟·迪安、美国驻南朝鲜大使布里格斯等举行会议。二十七日，远东美军总司令赫尔就用自己的专机把李承晚送到台北去。第二天，迪安在关于朝鲜政治会议问题的双方会谈中公开威胁说：“是和是战，我们都准备好了。”泰勒也在二十九日恫吓说，美国和李承晚有着“共同利益”，
  “确能在一起工作”。他还说，“我们万事都已计划妥当。”很明显，美国想嗾使李、蒋匪帮强迫扣留战俘，破坏朝鲜停战，以便在远东继续保持紧张局势。
    但是，美国纠集了十六个国家的军队加上李承晚伪军，在小小的朝鲜半岛上打了三年，尚且遭到了惨重的失败，现在居然企图拿李承晚的残兵败将和蒋介石的一些“胡子兵”来叫嚣吓人，岂非太不自量！
