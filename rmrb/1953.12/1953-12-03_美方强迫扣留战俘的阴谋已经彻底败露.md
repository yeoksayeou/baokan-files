Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 2nd: This reporter Wu Min reports: Chief Delegate of the Korean-Chinese side, Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao’s strong protest at the Military Armistice Commission meeting on the 1st clearly illustrated how the special agents of the Syngman Rhee and Kuomintang remnants in the camps, under the instructions of the Americans outside the camps, seriously undermined the "Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and completely paralyzed the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The US members of the Military Armistice Commission repeatedly disregarded the strong protests of the Korean-Chinese side regarding the illegal activities of special agents preventing the repatriation of prisoners of war, and even denied the evidence placed before them. However, this time, the US Chief Delegate, Lacey, dared not deny the evidence provided by a letter of instruction from Syngman Rhee and his commander of the Gendarmerie Headquarters to the special agents stationed in the detention camps.

    This letter instructed the special agents to obstruct the explanation work and kill prisoners of war who requested repatriation. From this letter, the reason for the serious difficulties faced by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces can be clearly seen. This detailed letter of instruction, intercepted by the Indian Custodial Forces, provided ironclad evidence proving that the special agents in the camps were directed by radio by Seoul and the so-called "embassy" of the Kuomintang bandit gang stationed in Busan using pre-arranged codes. These instructions ordered the special agents to strengthen their special agent organizations, designate special agent leaders to sabotage the explanation work, and murder prisoners of war who hoped to be repatriated. This conclusive evidence has been confirmed in previous statements by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, which stated that there were illegal organizations in the camps that committed atrocities against prisoners of war, and demanded that the US side cease its "illegal activities," stop sending wireless equipment to special agents in the camps, and stop using the US military's 64th Hospital as a liaison center between the special agents in the various camps.

    Yesterday, Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao pointed out to Lacey the US side's "continuous and unscrupulous serious crimes of tearing up the 'Scope of Authority' and sabotaging the Armistice Agreement," and then asked him two straightforward questions:

  "Does your side recognize the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces' use of necessary force, in accordance with the provisions of the 'Scope of Authority,' to restore and exercise their legitimate powers to sanction special agents and control the camps? Or will your side continue the various criminal activities carried out by the special agents under your command, thereby assuming the serious responsibility for undermining the implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement?" Lacey twice refused to answer these two questions. When the question was raised for the third time, Lacey still evaded answering, only saying that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces could take "reasonable" and "appropriate" actions, wanting to push the responsibility onto them.

    All this undeniable evidence exposes the United States' inhuman anti-repatriation conspiracy to detain Korean-Chinese prisoners of war, and punctures the "victory of psychological warfare" that American propagandists have been boasting about triumphantly. The evidence provided by the Korean-Chinese prisoners of war who have already returned, as well as the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces, conclusively proves the heinous fact that the use of force and coercion by special agents of Syngman Rhee and Kuomintang remnants, directed from the outside, are preventing the repatriation of more than 20,000 Korean-Chinese prisoners of war in the custodial camps.

    The fact that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces have not been able to fulfill the main responsibilities and obligations stipulated in the "Scope of Authority" further proves that the special agents directed by the US side completely control the non-directly repatriated prisoners of war. Unless they would rather be shot dead by Indian troops or dragged back to die miserably at the hands of special agents, risking climbing over barbed wire, they have no opportunity to express their desire for repatriation.

    However, two hundred Korean-Chinese prisoners of war have taken this dangerous approach of escaping without explanation, revealing the true face of the American "victory of psychological warfare." The whole world has now seen that the prisoners of war who American spokesmen said "would rather die than be repatriated" must be prevented from requesting repatriation by murder, cutting flesh, tattooing, gouging out hearts, and other barbaric means of intimidation and terror. When strict news blockades were implemented on Geoje Island, Jeju Island, and the South Korean mainland, American representatives and Eisenhower shamelessly told the world that "these prisoners of war must be forced to repatriate at bayonet point." Since the prisoners of war were handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for custody, the American government's loudly trumpeted American-made lie for more than a year that "prisoners of war would rather commit suicide than be repatriated" has become a hot potato in the hands of American propagandists. The communiqué of the Indian Custodial Forces also reported cases of prisoners of war in the camps attempting suicide because special agents prevented them from applying for repatriation, which also exposed this lie of the US side.

    American spokesmen and "psychological warfare" experts dare not answer the following question: If the non-directly repatriated prisoners of war were, as claimed, "fiercely opposed to repatriation," then why were reactionary slogans, which the Kuomintang bandit gang's news agency called "political death certificates," tattooed on their arms, chests, backs, abdomens, hips, and even legs? Why did the US side place special agents in the camps to murder prisoners of war? The upcoming trial of the seven special agents involved in the murder of prisoner of war Zhang Zilong in Camp No. 28 provides the answer to the world - tattooing the prisoners of war and killing them was to prevent their repatriation.

    The American deception that was used to deadlock the armistice negotiations for more than a year has gone bankrupt. All efforts by Lacey and Washington to shift the responsibility for not fulfilling the "Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" onto the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces will be futile. The Korean-Chinese side has grasped a large amount of ironclad evidence, and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces have also proven that the US side is obstructing the implementation of the Armistice Agreement through special agents and forcibly detaining more than 20,000 Korean-Chinese prisoners of war, thereby making the "Scope of Authority" a scrap of paper.

### 美方强迫扣留战俘的阴谋已经彻底败露

    美方强迫扣留战俘的阴谋已经彻底败露
    【新华社开城二日电】本社特派记者吴敏报道：朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将在一日军事停战委员会会议上提出的强硬抗议，清楚地说明了营场内的李承晚和国民党残匪的特务如何在营场外美国人的指示下严重地破坏了“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”，并且使中立国遣返委员会的工作完全陷于瘫痪。军事停战委员会的美方委员一再漠视朝中方面就特务阻止战俘遣返的非法活动所提出的强硬抗议，甚至否认放在他们面前的证据。然而，这一次，美方首席委员拉西却不敢否认李承晚和他的宪兵总司令官给安置在看管营中的特务的一封指示信中所提供的证据了。
    这封信指示特务阻挠解释工作并且杀死要求遣返的战俘。从这封信里，可以清楚地看出中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队面临严重困难的原因。印度看管部队截获的这封详尽的指示信，提供了铁一般的证据，证明营场内的特务是由汉城和国民党匪帮驻釜山的所谓“大使馆”用预先约定的密码，通过无线电来指挥的。这些指示命令特务加强他们的特务组织，并且指定特务头子破坏解释工作，并谋杀希望遣返的战俘。这个确凿的罪证在中立国遣返委员会以前的声明中就已得到证实，声明证明在营场中有对战俘进行暴行的非法组织存在，并且要求美方停止它的“非法活动”，不再运无线电机给营场内的特务，不再用美军第六十四医院来作为各营场的特务间的联络中心。
    李相朝中将昨天向拉西指出美方“继续不断、肆无忌惮地撕毁‘职权范围’破坏停战协定的严重罪行”，接着并向他提出了两个直截了当的问题：
  “你方是否承认中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队依照‘职权范围’的规定为恢复和行使其制裁特务和控制营场的合法权力而使用必要的武力？或者你方仍将继续你方指挥特务所进行的各种罪恶活动，从而承当破坏朝鲜停战协定之实施的严重责任。”拉西对这两个问题两次拒绝答复。当这个问题第三次提出的时候，拉西仍规避答复，只是说，中立国遣返委员会与印度看管部队能够采取“合理的”“适当的”行动，想这样来把责任推在它们身上。
    所有这些不能否认的证据，揭穿了美国想扣留朝中战俘的灭绝人性的反遣返阴谋，戳破了美国宣传家一直在得意洋洋地吹嘘的“心理战的胜利”。已经遣返归来的朝中被俘人员以及中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队所提供的证据，确实地证明了一个罪恶的事实，就是受外界指挥的李承晚与国民党残匪的特务所使用的武力以及武力胁迫，正在阻挠看管营中二万多名朝中被俘人员的遣返。
    中立国遣返委员会与印度看管部队没有能够履行“职权范围”所规定的主要责任与义务，这一点进一步证明美方所指挥的特务完全控制了不直接遣返的战俘。除非他们宁可被印度军队击毙或是被拉回去惨死在特务手里，冒险爬过铁丝网，他们就没有机会表示他们要求遣返的愿望。
    但是，已有两百名朝中被俘人员采取了这种不经过解释就逃回来的危险办法，而使美国的“心理战的胜利”现了原形。全世界现在都已看到，美国发言人所说的“宁死也不愿遣返”的战俘，原来是必须用谋杀、割肉、刺字、剜心以及其他威吓和恐怖的野蛮手段来阻止他们要求遣返的。当巨济岛、济州岛和南朝鲜大陆上实行着严密的新闻封锁时，会议桌上的美国代表和艾森豪威尔曾厚颜无耻地告诉全世界说，“这些战俘必须用刺刀逼着才会遣返。”自从战俘交给中立国遣返委员会看管以后，美国政府大吹大擂地宣传了一年多的“战俘宁愿自杀也不愿遣返”这种美国造的谎言，就成了美国宣传家手中的一个烫手的山药蛋。印度看管部队的公报也报告了营场中的战俘因为特务阻止他们申请遣返而企图自杀的案件，这也揭穿了美方的这一谎言。
    美国发言人和“心理战”专家不敢回答下面这个问题：如果不直接遣返的战俘像所说的那样是
  “激烈反对遣返”的话，那么为什么要在他们的手臂、胸膛、背部、腹部、臀部甚至腿部刺上国民党匪帮通讯社称为“政治死亡证”的反动标语呢？为什么美方要在营场中安插特务来谋杀战俘呢？即将审讯的参与谋杀第二十八号营场战俘张子龙的七个特务的案件，向全世界提供了答复——给战俘们刺字并杀害他们，是为了阻止他们的遣返。
    用来使停战谈判陷于僵局达一年多之久的美国的欺骗伎俩已经破产了。拉西和华盛顿把没有履行
  “中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的责任转嫁到中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队身上的一切努力，都将是徒劳的。朝中方面已经掌握了大量的铁证，中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队也证明美方正通过特务来阻挠停战协定的履行，并强迫扣留两万多名朝中被俘人员，从而使“职权范围”成为一张废纸。
