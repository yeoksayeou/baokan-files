	Neolithic Site Discovered in Qishan County, Shaanxi Province
	A Neolithic site has recently been discovered near Wangjiazuzi Village, Qinghua Town, Qishan County, Shaanxi Province. The site is located on a loess terrace approximately 100 meters high, surrounded by gullies on three sides, covering an area of approximately 24,000 square meters, with a layer of ash soil beneath the cultivated soil. Exquisite painted pottery fragments, red pottery fragments, red pottery fragments mixed with sand, as well as red pottery fragments with rope patterns and gray pottery fragments, have been found on the surface. Every few feet along the edge of the site, there is an ash pit about two or three meters deep, also mixed with the aforementioned pottery fragments. According to archaeological research, these ash pits may have been places where ancient people dumped garbage. Stone axes, spindle whorls, flat-bottomed red pottery plates, large painted pottery bottle mouths, and fragments of white lime soil have also been discovered around the site.
	The Shaanxi Provincial People's Government has now notified the local People's Government to properly protect this site for further research or excavation work.

      陕西省岐山县发现新石器时代遗址
    陕西省岐山县青化镇王家嘴子村附近，最近发现了一处新石器时代的遗址。遗址位置在一个约一百公尺高的黄土台地上，三面临沟，面积约二万四千多平方公尺，在耕土下是一层灰土。地面上发现有精美的彩陶片、红陶片、加有沙质的红陶片、以及有绳纹的红陶片和灰陶片等遗物。遗址边缘每隔数尺就有一个深约二、三公尺的灰坑，里面也都掺杂有上述各种陶片。据考古人员的研究，这些灰坑可能是古代人民堆积垃圾的地方，在遗址周围还发现有石斧、纺线锤、平底红色陶碟、大形彩陶瓶口和白灰土片等遗物。
    陕西省人民政府现已通知当地人民政府对这个遗址妥加保护，以便进一步进行研究或发掘的工作。
