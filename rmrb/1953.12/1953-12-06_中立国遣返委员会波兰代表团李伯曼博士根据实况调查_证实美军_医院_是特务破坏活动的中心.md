Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 4th: Dr. Liberman, a medical doctor and colonel with the Polish delegation to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, conducted an on-the-spot investigation of the U.S. Army's 64th Field Hospital at the Tongchang-ri custodial camp of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The investigation confirmed that this U.S. military hospital was a place to cover up illegal activities against prisoners of war who wished to be repatriated. Dr. Liberman's investigation report was written based on official reports and information provided by Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who had returned from this hospital.

One of the facts cited by Dr. Liberman to illustrate that this U.S. military field hospital was established for nefarious purposes is: the hospital had a large number of administrative and support personnel, far exceeding the number of medical personnel, with a ratio of 1.26 to 1; 184 administrative and support personnel and only 146 medical personnel. Even in the most modern hospitals, where medical equipment and technology require a large number of experts and assistants, the ratio is only one administrative person to three medical personnel. These personnel in this hospital were not performing the job of caring for patients. The Korean nurses here have always been passing written instructions from outside to the secret agents in the hospital.

Another terrible fact pointed out by Dr. Liberman is that this hospital, set up for approximately 23,000 prisoners of war in the Tongchang-ri POW camp, had a very large number of beds. The existing number of beds in this POW camp accounts for about 8.7 percent of the total number of prisoners of war (2,000 beds), which is completely unnecessary. Only 230 beds would have been sufficient, because the generally accepted average daily index of patients seeking medical attention is 1 percent, and the average duration of hospitalization is 10 days. Even including 1,000 "long-term patients"—although these so-called "long-term patients" are very suspicious—1,230 beds would have been more than enough.

Information provided by repatriated prisoners of war fully confirms that prisoners of war were often deliberately kept in the hospital after their health was restored. Many Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee special agents who abused patients and directed espionage activities in various POW camps were also listed as "patients." This is why the number of patients in the hospital did not match, and was actually larger than the number of genuinely sick people.

Dr. Liberman revealed that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission did not receive information on the movements of patients in the POW camps and hospitals. Therefore, the Commission could not even exercise nominal control over the hospital, which had become a central station for special agents from various camp areas.

The special agents came to the hospital under the guise of "patients." After receiving training and instructions on how to sabotage the explanation work and how to carry out terrorist activities against the prisoners of war, they were deemed "cured" and returned to their original camp areas. It is said that some American doctors in the hospital ordered the special agents to beat, bury alive, or kill sick prisoners of war who requested repatriation. Beating and starvation were commonly used as "educational methods" against prisoners of war suspected of requesting repatriation. Repatriated prisoners of war reported that three patients were killed in the last ten days of September and on October 1st. The Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee special agents in the hospital also incited prisoners of war to oppose the Polish and Czechoslovak representatives of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and sometimes also the Indian representatives. These special agents also refused to provide medical treatment to prisoners of war who expressed a desire to return home.

    中立国遣返委员会波兰代表团李伯曼博士根据实况调查
    证实美军“医院”是特务破坏活动的中心
    【新华社开城四日电】中立国遣返委员会波兰代表团的医学博士李伯曼上校对中立国遣返委员会东场里看管营场的美军第六十四野战医院进行的一次实况调查，证实了这个美军医院是掩护对愿意遣返的战俘进行非法活动的场所。李伯曼博士的调查报告书是根据官方报告和由这个医院归来的朝中战俘提供的情报写成的。
    李伯曼博士举出的足以说明这个美军野战医院是为了罪恶目的而设立的事实之一是：医院中有着很多的管理人员和辅助人员，其人数远远超过医务人员，他们的比例是一点二六比一；管理人员和辅助人员有一百八十四名，医务人员仅有一百四十六名。即使在最现代化的医院中，医疗器械和技术设施需要人数众多的专家和助手，但其人数比例也仅仅是一名管理人员对三名医务人员。这个医院里的这些人员所担任的工作并不是照顾病号的。这里的朝鲜护士一向是给医院里的特务们传递外面来的书面指示的。
    李伯曼博士指出的另一个可怕事实是：这个为东场里战俘营里的大约二万三千名战俘设立的医院备有极大数目的病床。这个战俘营里现有的病床约占战俘总人数的百分之八点七（二千张病床），这是完全不必要的。只要有二百三十张病床就足够了，因为一般公认的每天就医的病号平均指数是百分之一，病号住院的期限平均是十天。即使把一千名
  “长期病号”计算在内——虽然这些所谓“长期病号”很使人怀疑——有一千二百三十只病床也已绰绰有余。
    遣返的战俘所提供的情报充分证实：战俘在健康恢复后常常被故意留在医院里。许多对病号进行虐待并指挥各战俘营里特务活动的国民党和李承晚的特务也被列为“病号”。这就是为什么医院里的病号的数目不符，实际地比真正病人的数目为大的缘故。
    李伯曼博士揭露：中立国遣返委员会得不到关于病号在战俘营和医院里的行动情况的资料，因此，委员会甚至不能对医院行使表面上的控制权，这医院已经变成从各个营场来的特务的中心站了。
    特务们以“病号”名义来到医院，在接受关于如何破坏解释工作，如何对战俘进行恐怖活动的训练和指示以后，就算“病已经痊愈了”，仍旧回到他们原来的营场里去。据说，医院里有些美国医生命令特务们殴打、活埋或杀害那些要求遣返的患病战俘。殴打和挨饿是经常用来对付被怀疑为要求遣返的战俘的“教育方法”。遣返回来的战俘们报告说：在九月的最后十天内和在十月一日有三个病号被杀害。医院里的国民党和李承晚的特务还唆使战俘们反对中立国遣返委员会的波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的代表，有时并反对印度代表。这些特务对表示回家愿望的战俘们，还拒绝给予医治。
