    The Vietnamese working people are excitedly welcoming the historic resolutions of the Third World Trade Union Congress. They deeply understand that once the resolutions of the congress are deeply disseminated among the broad working people of various countries, it will become an important factor in improving the international situation and will be conducive to improving the lives of the working people and the struggle to defend peace.
    The Congress decided to designate December 19, 1953, as "International Day of Active Support for the Vietnamese People and the Struggle to Stop the Colonial War in Vietnam." The Vietnamese people express their infinite gratitude for this. The Vietnamese people once again recognize the deep concern of the world's working people for the just struggle of the Vietnamese people. Throughout the entire war of liberation, especially in the war of resistance against the French aggressor group and the American interventionists, the Vietnamese people have often received the sympathy and support of the people of the world. This sympathy and support has greatly encouraged the Vietnamese people, enhanced their fighting power and confidence in victory. The growth of the French working class under the leadership of Comrade Maurice Thorez and the French Communist Party, and Karl Marx's teaching that "a nation that oppresses other nations cannot be free," are increasingly promoting the French people's movement against the war of aggression in Vietnam. This movement is gradually becoming widespread to every stratum of the French people and deeply affecting France's various colonies and dependencies.
    The French people strongly oppose the unjust war launched by the reactionary French colonialists. The heroic actions of Henri Martin and the struggle of the dockworkers in Marseille to refuse to transport French colonialists' munitions to Vietnam are symbols of the high internationalist spirit of the French working class and people. The French government has even arrested French people's leaders and peace fighters such as Comrades Duclos, Stil, Ducron, Lerippe, and Flahaut because of this. It vainly attempts to weaken the French Communist Party, various democratic parties, and the fighting forces of the French people against aggression. However, the French people are increasingly responding to the French colonialists with more resolute actions, and have already restored the freedom of many peace fighters who truly represent their interests.
    This year, French mothers will spend Christmas, the eighth year after the outbreak of the Vietnam War, with grief and sorrow. Their beloved sons are losing their lives in distant Vietnam to maintain the interests of some French and American monopoly capitalist groups; the French government still follows the dictates of its American masters and continues its criminal war in Vietnam. The broad masses of the French people are increasingly recognizing that this war is an important reason for their increasing impoverishment and for France's increasing dependence on American imperialism. Therefore, the national conference convened in Paris on November 22, 1953, by representatives of various social strata and various political tendencies representative of the French people, demonstrated the firm will of the French people to end the war of aggression against Vietnam. And the people of all French colonial countries warmly sympathize with and support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance. Young people in North Africa and Madagascar have repeatedly waged resolute struggles, refusing to take up arms for the colonialists to slaughter the Vietnamese people in Vietnam. Workers in Algeria and other North African ports have launched continuous struggles in the past four years to refuse to transship French weapons to Vietnam. This is a positive action to support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance and an example for the oppressed nations to unite against the common enemy—the imperialists.
    The close unity and struggle between the people of the French colonies and the people of Vietnam proves that the people of all colonial countries are oppressed by the ruling groups of the colonialists, and that the working people of the oppressed countries have today united into a strong force. This united force is an important factor in eliminating imperialist aggression and eliminating the oppression and exploitation of the working people in their own countries and in the colonial and semi-colonial countries of the world.
    The Soviet people, under the leadership of the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union, have always been strong supporters of the people of all small and weak countries. The Soviet Union is a strong fortress of world revolution and a model for the formation of a large family of free and equal people of all nationalities. During the days of the French colonialists' sinful rule, the Vietnamese working class and the Vietnamese people saw the life of the Soviet people as if they saw their own beautiful future. For the Vietnamese people, the Soviet Union has become a beacon of light and a source of encouragement. In these days of arduous war of resistance, the Vietnamese people are very grateful to the outstanding fighters and heroes of the Soviet Union for their warm sympathy for the Vietnamese people's war to defend their motherland. Whenever representatives of Vietnamese people's organizations participating in various international conferences pass through the Soviet Union, they receive brotherly, warm, and cordial reception and assistance from the Soviet people. This is the sincere friendship of the Soviet people towards the Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese people clearly recognize that every victory of the Soviet people in the cause of building communism is helpful to the Vietnamese people. The strength of the Soviet Union is a powerful guarantee for the national liberation struggles and the struggle for peace.
    The success of the great Chinese People's Revolution under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong is a great encouragement to the Vietnamese people. The great victory of the Chinese people has transformed the Vietnamese war of resistance from the past encirclement situation to the current situation where it can be connected with the infinitely broad rear of the peace and democracy camp with 800 million people in various people's democratic countries and socialist countries; more importantly, the victory of the Chinese people has given the Vietnamese people many valuable experiences, making the Vietnamese people more confident in the victory of their struggle.
    The working people of various people's democratic countries have expressed great concern for the Vietnamese people; now the people of various people's democratic countries are accelerating their progress on the road of building socialism to enhance the strength of world peace and democracy, and at the same time, they are also enhancing the strength of the Vietnamese people.
    The working people of all strata in the United States and its satellite countries unanimously oppose the brutal interference of the American monopoly capitalist groups in Vietnam. From the capitalist countries of Europe and America to the most distant countries on earth, tens of thousands of people have recognized the sinful actions of the French aggressors and American interventionists in Vietnam, and have expressed warm sympathy for the Vietnamese people's war of resistance. This will has been fully reflected in the successive conferences of world workers, youth, and women, in the Asian and Pacific Peace Conference, and in the World People's Peace Congress held in Vienna.
    Facts have proven that the imperialist group headed by American imperialism has never been so completely exposed and isolated as it is now. On the contrary, the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union has never been so consolidated and strengthened as it is now. This situation makes the Vietnamese people more excited and determined in their struggle.
    The active support of the people of the world for the Vietnamese people is because the cause of national liberation in Vietnam is also the common cause of the working people of all countries, as pointed out in the appeal to the workers of the world issued by the World Federation of Trade Unions on November 10, 1953.
    In addition to invading and plundering the resources of the Vietnamese people, the French colonialists and American interventionists also attempted to use Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos as bases for invading Asian countries and as springboards for preparing to attack the People's Republic of China, thereby becoming a fuse for a new world war. The people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos have taken up arms to fight for the defense of their own freedom and independence, and at the same time, they are also fighting to defend peace in Asia and the world.
    The resolute actions of the people of the world have stopped the war of aggression against Korea by the American aggressors and their satellite countries, who were stained with blood, and forced them to sign an armistice agreement. This further proves that the strength of the peace and democracy camp is stronger than the strength of the imperialist camp. Following this victory, the people of the world are increasingly actively opposing the wars of aggression in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and Malaya. At the same time, the Third World Trade Union Congress has designated December 19, 1953, as the day when the working people of all countries unite to strive for an end to the colonial war in Vietnam. This situation fully embodies the spirit of proletarian internationalism. The slogan of peace and friendship between nations has become the unified action of hundreds of millions of people in various countries. We live in this new era, and the fate of each nation is interconnected with the fate of all nations in the world, and the struggle of each nation for freedom and independence is part of the common struggle of all nations in the world for peace and democracy. The imperialists' acts of aggression against every free nation have been met with fierce resistance from the people of the world.
    The resolution of the Third World Trade Union Congress on the aforementioned December 19, 1953, is a severe sanction and serious warning from the working people of the world against the crimes of the French aggressors and American interventionists in invading Vietnam. Now, under the pressure of the French people and the people of the world, the reactionary Laniel government is releasing hypocritical peace rhetoric, but in fact they are stepping up the implementation of the "Navarre Plan" in the war of aggression against Vietnam in order to obtain more American aid. Everyone knows that the Laniel government has cheaply exchanged the blood of French youth for dollars, succumbed to its American masters to continue the Vietnam War to maintain the interests of American monopoly capital, and has repeatedly sold out the interests of French colonies and France itself to the United States. The Vietnamese people have always expressed their desire for peace, and the Vietnamese people are fighting precisely for independence and peace. In November of this year, President Ho Chi Minh pointed out the Vietnamese people's clear position of loving peace in an interview with a reporter from the Swedish "Expressen." President Ho Chi Minh pointed out: "Now, if the French colonialists continue their war of aggression against Vietnam, the Vietnamese people are determined to carry out their patriotic struggle to the final victory. However, if the French government has learned a lesson from more than seven years of war and is willing to negotiate, obtain a ceasefire, and resolve the Vietnam issue, the people and government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are willing to accept this proposal from France." On December 19 this year, the Vietnamese people will sum up the achievements of the seven or eight years of war of resistance against aggression. They are extremely excited that the working people of the world regard this day as a day of close solidarity with the Vietnamese people. This warm class love of the working people of the world has been deeply felt by every Vietnamese patriot, thereby enabling the Vietnamese working people to better understand the great proletarian internationalist spirit of the working people of the world.
    President Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnamese Labor Party often educate the Vietnamese people with the spirit of combining patriotism and internationalism, so the Vietnamese people always realize that the victory of the Vietnamese war of resistance is inseparable from the sympathy and support of the people of the world. Commemorating December 19, 1953, the Vietnamese people will further strengthen their friendship with the great Soviet people, the Chinese people, and the people of various people's democratic countries, and unite with the French people, the various colonies of France, and the people of all countries who love freedom and peace to fight against the common enemy—the imperialist aggressors. The Vietnamese people regard this friendship as a powerful guarantee that the Vietnamese war of resistance will surely be victorious. While infinitely grateful for the enthusiasm of the people of the world, the Vietnamese people will also always remember what President Ho Chi Minh taught: the victory of the Vietnamese people's liberation cause must first of all rely on the hard work of the Vietnamese people themselves. The Vietnamese working people and various mass organizations commemorate this year's National War of Resistance Memorial Day with extraordinary excitement, and strive to launch a competition to realize the two central tasks of 1954 put forward by President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese Labor Party, and the Vietnamese People's Government: namely, strengthening the war of resistance and carrying out land reform. The Vietnamese people will transform the deep feelings of the people of the world into an irresistible force to heavily strike the French aggressors and American interventionists, in order to achieve the victory of the war of resistance as soon as possible, and to struggle for the liberation cause of the nations of the world. In this way we will not disappoint the expectations of peace-loving people all over the world.

    世界人民和越南人民的伟大团结
    越南全国总工会主席　黄国越
    越南劳动人民兴奋地欢迎世界工会第三次代表大会具有历史意义的决议。他们深知，大会的决议一旦深入地传播到各国的广大劳动人民中间，它就会成为改善国际局势的一个重要因素，并有利于提高劳动人民的生活和保卫和平的斗争。
    大会决定将一九五三年十二月十九日作为“国际积极支援越南人民日与争取停止越南殖民战争斗争日”。越南人民对此表示无限的感激。越南人民再一次认识到世界劳动人民对越南人民的正义斗争的深切关怀。在整个的解放战争中，尤其是在反对法国侵略集团和美国干涉者的抗战中，越南人民经常地获得全世界人民的同情和支持，这些同情和支持大大地鼓舞了越南人民，使越南人民增强了战斗力和胜利的信心。在莫里斯·多列士同志和法国共产党领导下的法国工人阶级力量的成长，和卡尔·马克思的“压迫其他民族的民族，是不能够自由的”的教诲，日益促进了法国人民反对在越南进行侵略战争的运动，这个运动逐渐地普遍到法国人民的每个阶层，并深刻地影响到法国的各个殖民地和附属国。
    法国人民强烈地反对由反动的法国殖民主义者发动的不义的战争。亨利·马丁的英勇行为，马赛码头工人拒绝把法国殖民主义者的军火运到越南的斗争，就是法国工人阶级和人民高度的国际主义精神的象征。法国政府竟因此逮捕法国人民领袖和和平战士，如杜克洛、斯梯、杜科朗、勒里普和弗拉商等同志。它妄想削弱法国共产党、各民主党派和法国人民反对侵略的战斗力量。然而，法国人民却日益以更坚决的行动来回答法国殖民主义者，并且已经使许多真正代表他们利益的和平战士重新获得了自由。
    今年，法国母亲们将以悲痛忧伤的心情来度过越南战争爆发后第八个年头的圣诞节。她们所钟爱的儿子正在辽远的越南为维护一些法国和美国垄断资本集团的利益而丧命；法国政府则仍然遵从美国主子的意旨，继续其在越南的罪恶战争。法国广大人民更加认清了这个战争是使他们日益穷困，使法国日益成为美帝国主义的附庸的重要原因。因此，在法国人民中具有代表性的社会各阶层和各种政治倾向的代表于一九五三年十一月二十二日在巴黎召开的全国会议，显示了法国人民要求结束侵越战争的坚强意志。而所有法国各殖民地国家的人民都热烈地同情与支持越南人民的抗战。北非和马达加斯加的青年已多次进行了坚决的斗争，拒绝为殖民者拿起枪杆到越南去屠杀越南人民。阿尔及利亚和北非其它码头的工人在最近的四年中连续不断地发动了拒绝转运法国武器到越南去的斗争。这是支持越南人民抗战的积极行动，并为各被压迫民族团结一致反对共同的敌人——帝国主义者的范例。
    法国各殖民地人民和越南人民密切团结进行斗争，证明了各殖民地国家的人民都受到殖民者统治集团的压迫，而被压迫的各国劳动人民今天已经团结成为一支坚强的力量了。这个团结力量是消灭帝国主义侵略和消灭对本国劳动人民和世界上各殖民地半殖民地的压迫剥削的一个重要因素。
    在伟大的苏联共产党领导下的苏联人民，经常是各弱小国家人民的有力的支持者。苏联是世界革命的坚强堡垒，是组成各族人民自由平等的大家庭的典范。在法国殖民者罪恶统治的日子里，越南工人阶级和越南人民看到了苏联人民的生活犹如看到了自己美好的将来。对于越南人民，苏联已成为光明的灯塔和鼓舞的力量。在今日艰苦抗战的日子里，越南人民非常感激苏联的优秀战士和英雄对于越南人民的保卫祖国战争所表示的热烈同情。每当参加各种国际会议的越南各人民团体代表经过苏联的时候，都得到苏联人民兄弟般热烈的亲切的接待和帮助，这是苏联人民对越南人民的真诚友谊。越南人民清楚地认识到了苏联人民在建设共产主义事业中的每一个胜利都是有助于越南人民的。苏联的强大也就是各个民族解放斗争和争取和平的有力保证。
    伟大的中国人民革命在毛泽东主席的领导下获得了成功，这对越南人民是一个很大的鼓舞。中国人民的伟大胜利，使得越南的抗战从过去的被包围形势转变为目前能与各人民民主国家和社会主义国家拥有八亿人口的和平民主阵营的无限广泛的后方联系起来；更重要的是中国人民的胜利给予了越南人民许多宝贵的经验，使得越南人民更加确信他们斗争的胜利。
    各人民民主国家的劳动人民对越南人民表示了极大的关怀；现在各人民民主国家的人民正在加速走上建设社会主义的道路以增强世界和平民主的力量，同时也就增强了越南人民的力量。
    美帝国主义以及其仆从国家的各阶层的劳动人民一致反对美国垄断资本集团对越南的横暴干涉。从欧美的资本主义各国到地球上最遥远的国家，成千成万的人民已经认清了法国侵略者和美国干涉者在越南的罪恶行为，并对越南人民的抗战表示了热烈的同情。这种意志已经在世界工人、青年、妇女的历次会议上，在亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议上，在维也纳召开的世界人民和平大会上充分地体现出来。
    事实证明，以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义集团从来没有像现在这样地被揭露无遗而陷于孤立。相反地，以苏联为首的和平民主阵营也从来没有像现在这样地巩固和壮大。这种情况使得越南人民在战斗中更加兴奋和坚决。
    世界人民对越南人民的积极支持是因为越南民族解放的事业也就是世界各国劳动人民共同的事业，一九五三年十一月十日世界工联所发出的告世界工人书中已经指明了这一点。
    法国殖民主义者和美国干涉者除了侵略和搜括越南人民的资源以外，还企图将越南、高棉、寮国作为侵略亚洲国家的基地，和作为准备向中华人民共和国进攻的跳板，从而成为引起新的世界大战的导火线。越南、高棉、寮国的人民拿起武器为保卫自己的自由和独立而战斗，同时也就是为保卫亚洲和世界和平而斗争。
    世界人民的坚决行动已经阻止了双手染满鲜血的美国侵略者及其仆从国家的侵朝战争，迫使他们不得不签订停战协定。这更证明了和平民主阵营的力量已较帝国主义阵营的力量更为强大。随着这个胜利，世界人民越来越积极地反对在越南、高棉、寮国、马来亚的侵略战争。同时，世界工会第三次代表大会已将一九五三年十二月十九日定为一切国家劳动人民团结起来争取结束越南殖民战争的日子，这种情形充分体现了无产阶级的国际主义精神。各民族之间的和平与友谊的口号已变成各国亿万人民统一的行动了。我们生长在这个新的时代，每个民族的命运都与世界各民族的命运互相关联着，而每一个民族为自由独立而进行的斗争也就是世界各民族争取和平、民主的共同斗争的一部分。帝国主义者对每一个自由民族的侵略行为都遭到了全世界人民的猛烈反抗。
    世界工会第三次代表大会关于上述一九五三年十二月十九日的决议，是全世界劳动人民对于法国侵略者和美国干涉者侵略越南罪行的严厉制裁和严重警告。现在，在法国人民及全世界人民压力之下，反动的拉尼埃政府正放出虚伪的和平论调，而事实上他们却在为取得更多的美援而加紧在侵越战争中实行“纳瓦尔军事计划”。谁都知道，拉尼埃政府已将法国青年的鲜血廉价地换取美元，屈从其美国主子继续越南战争来维护美国垄断资本的利益，并且无数次地把法国殖民地和法国本国的利益出卖给美国。越南人民在任何时候都表明了自己对和平的愿望，越南人民正是为了独立与和平而奋斗。今年十一月，胡志明主席在答瑞典“快报”记者问的谈话中曾指出了越南人民爱好和平的鲜明立场。胡志明主席指出：“现在假如法国殖民主义者继续其侵略越南的战争，越南人民是有决心将自己的爱国斗争进行到最后胜利的。但是，假如法国政府因七年多的战争已得到教训，愿意经过谈判，获得停战并解决越南问题，越南民主共和国的人民和政府是愿意接受法国这项建议的。”今年十二月十九日，越南人民将总结七、八年来的反对侵略的抗战的成绩。他们对于世界劳动人民把这个日子作为和越南人民亲密团结的日子而感到无比的兴奋。世界劳动人民的这种热烈的阶级友爱已为每个越南的爱国者所深深感受，从而使越南劳动人民更加体会到世界劳动人民伟大的无产阶级的国际主义精神。
    胡志明主席和越南劳动党经常以爱国主义和国际主义相结合的精神教育越南人民，因此越南人民时刻都认识到越南的抗战胜利是与世界人民的同情与支持分不开的。纪念一九五三年十二月十九日，越南人民将要更加增强与伟大的苏联人民、中国人民和各人民民主国家的人民的友谊，并与法国人民、法国的各殖民地和各国爱好自由、和平的人民团结一致，为反对共同的敌人——帝国主义侵略者而斗争。越南人民将这种友谊看作是一个对越南抗战一定取得胜利的有力保证。在无限地感激世界人民的热情的同时，越南人民也永远记住胡志明主席所教导的：越南人民的解放事业的胜利首先是要依靠越南人民自己的艰苦努力才能实现的。越南劳动人民和各群众团体以异常兴奋的心情来纪念今年的全国抗战纪念日，努力发动竞赛以实现胡志明主席、越南劳动党和越南人民政府所提出的一九五四年的两个中心任务：即加强抗战和进行土地改革。越南人民将把世界人民深厚的感情化为一支不可抗拒的力量以沉重地打击法国侵略者和美国干涉者，以求早日取得抗战的胜利，并为世界各民族的解放事业而奋斗，这样，才不辜负全世界爱好和平人民的期望。
