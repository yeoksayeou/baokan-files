    The Tibet Military Region Medical Team Actively Treats Tibetan People
    The medical team of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Tibet Military Region stationed in Xigaze is actively serving the Tibetan people. From July of last year to September of this year, the medical team has provided outpatient and home visit services for more than 25,400 people; this spring, more than 21,000 people were vaccinated against smallpox; and 60 percent of the venereal disease patients treated by the medical team have recovered their health. In the past, the infant mortality rate in the Xigaze area was very high. The obstetrics and gynecology department of the medical team regularly examines pregnant women and uses scientific methods to deliver babies for Tibetan women. The medical team staff also uses charts and photographs to educate Tibetan women on scientific knowledge of maternal and child health. The medical team attaches importance to seasonal epidemic prevention work. Diphtheria was discovered in Xigaze City this summer, and the medical team immediately carried out effective treatment and widely conducted epidemic prevention publicity work, promptly eradicating the epidemic. During the busy farming seasons of spring plowing and autumn harvest this year, the medical team successively sent five mobile medical teams deep into the agricultural areas of various Dzongs to treat the masses. In the ten xiqia of Namling Dzong in northeastern Xigaze, the medical team vaccinated more than 3,200 farmers and children against smallpox. Currently, Xigaze City is preparing to build a large-scale people's hospital. A group of medical personnel recently sent by the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government has also arrived in Xigaze City to start work.
    Tibetan Students at the Tibet Military Region Cadre School Make Progress in Their Studies
    More than 100 Tibetan students studying at the Chinese People's Liberation Army Tibet Military Region Cadre School have made progress in their political studies and their native language studies over the past year. These Tibetan students come from pastures and rural areas, as well as educated youths from Lhasa, Xigaze, and other places. When they first entered the school, most of them did not know Tibetan, but now they can write general letters and read ordinary documents. Those with excellent grades can already translate simple documents and have begun to study Tibetan literary works. After studying patriotism and relevant ethnic policies, the students' political consciousness and patriotic enthusiasm have been greatly improved. Now, seven students have honorably joined the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and fifteen have been rated as study models for the entire school.
    China Youth Art Troupe to Hold Performance in Beijing
    The China Youth Art Troupe, which participated in the 4th World Youth and Students for Peace and Friendship Festival, has recently returned to Beijing in succession. After the end of the festival, the troupe went to Poland for a tour of more than a month, and then went to the German Democratic Republic to participate in the Sino-German Cultural Week and toured, receiving a warm welcome from the governments and people of the two countries. Now, the troupe will perform its various programs that are well received by various countries, such as the Peking opera "Havoc in Heaven," "Yandang Mountain," "Autumn River," and folk dances "Lion Dance" and "Butterfly Dance," as well as solo singing and instrumental performances, in Beijing as a report performance, and tickets will be sold publicly.
