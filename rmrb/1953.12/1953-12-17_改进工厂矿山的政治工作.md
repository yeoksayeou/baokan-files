Improve Political Work in Factories and Mines
Sun Liangcai, Director of the Industrial Department of the Liaoxi Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

In the past six months, I have visited factories and mines several times and witnessed the rapid development and progress of the work in factories and mines. At the same time, I have also seen that the Party's political work still lags behind the needs of production management. We are learning and adopting the most scientific production management experiences and the most advanced technological achievements of the Soviet Union. The enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers in factories and mines are particularly high. Compared with these, political work still seems very weak, so it is necessary to strengthen political work. How to strengthen political work? I think we should pay attention to the following issues:

Political Work Must Be Closely Integrated with Economic Work

Any factory or mine, no matter how large its scale or how complex its technological processes, is a unified production entity. The establishment of management institutions and Party and mass organizations in factories and mines is all for the purpose of organizing production and ensuring the completion of the state's production plans. There is no other purpose. The responsibility of production management lies in scientifically organizing the production process and the circulation process. The responsibility of political workers lies in unifying the ideological understanding and actions of all employees in a timely manner. That is, when carrying out each new task or solving major problems in production, the Party Committee must first use methods such as investigating the situation and studying documents to unify the understanding of the leading cadres of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League. Secondly, through typical experiments, use the rational understanding proven in the actual process to unify the understanding and actions of all cadres; use the real people and real events created in key trials to publicize and educate the masses, and overcome various erroneous ideas; use the experience gained in key trials to correctly guide the work. At the same time, when promoting the experience from points to the whole, we should unify the understanding of cadres and masses based on new situations and new problems discovered, as well as new instructions from higher authorities, in order to promote the continuous development of work. Therefore, management work and political work are only taking different methods from different aspects to complete the same task, and the two must not be separated. In terms of management, it is necessary to establish a responsibility system, and political work must carry out education to strengthen the sense of responsibility. The two coexist and play a role together. However, some comrades have a one-sided understanding of these issues. They have absolutized the necessary division of labor between different organizations, and thus, the idea of setting up their own houses, establishing their own banners, and going their own way has emerged, making political work to a certain extent detached from the current production management work. At present, the phenomenon that Party and mass organization cadres in factories and mines have insufficient understanding of the content and importance of management work, and management cadres have insufficient understanding of the importance and content of political work still exists quite commonly. Therefore, there is a phenomenon that political work and economic work cannot be closely integrated. This is very detrimental to the production of factories and mines. Therefore, the Party Committee in factories and mines must, in accordance with national laws, the plans of higher-level economic organs, and the instructions of higher-level Party committees, use the method of strengthening the Party's ideological leadership to unify the ideological understanding and actions of various organizations with the realization of economic plans as the center. The administrative responsible cadres in factories and mines should help Party and mass work cadres understand the national production plans, production processes, and production management work, etc., so that political work and economic work can be closely integrated.

Strengthen Department Work, Overcome Decentralism, and Achieve Unified Leadership of Production

The technological process in modern enterprises is very scientific, meticulous, and complex. It requires a high degree of centralized and unified production management. This requires the establishment of a production area management system with the factory director in charge on the one hand, and on the other hand, it requires the Party organization in the enterprise to pay attention to overcoming decentralized phenomena in the work at all times. In the past, many enterprises implemented functional management, and each department was accustomed to issuing orders to the lower levels in its own way. This was an important reason for the "five excesses" and decentralism within the enterprise. The factory director responsibility system has been implemented, but before the factory director is fully familiar with the business, the multi-headed leadership of the functional system will still revive to a certain extent. This situation is very common. For example, the Fuxin Mining Bureau has two offices, thirteen divisions, and sixty-eight sections. In the second quarter, these divisions and sections continuously deployed eight major tasks to the lower levels, such as safe production, planned management, and the establishment of a responsibility system. From January to May, they issued as many as 2,776 documents in the name of the bureau director, of which 116 documents were issued to each other in the name of the bureau director by the divisions working in the same office building. The pit chief of Ping'an No. 1 pit of the bureau spent 18 days attending meetings in the bureau in a month. This is precisely a manifestation of each section emphasizing its own work and the lack of understanding of leading cadres. This summer, when some factories and mines were establishing a responsibility system, each department scrambled to list the responsibility system related to strengthening its own department's work as the first center. This shows that the department cadres lack an overall view of caring about the overall situation. The understanding of problems by the department work cadres in some factories and mines is often not unified, and some people are accustomed to considering problems only from the convenience of their own work. For example, on the issue of economic accounting, the attitude of the production section is: "Whatever production needs should be given, and it doesn't matter if the consumption quota is exceeded a little"; the grassroots production units have the idea of "allowance for leeway"; while the cost section disregards the production situation and sticks to the financial cost plan; in terms of original records and statistical reports, each department often forms its own system, so that the recording and statistical work has problems such as being unrealistic, having many items, being repetitive, and lacking a clear purpose. The disunity between departments, between departments and workshops, and between cadres within departments has also contributed to the decentralist tendency in department work.

Therefore, the Party organization in factories and mines must strengthen the political work of the departments. First of all, the political and ideological level of the department personnel should be improved so that they can correctly understand that regardless of the size of the department organization, it is an auxiliary institution of the factory director responsibility system. Department staff should, based on their functions, have a good understanding and analysis of the production situation of the factory and mine, proceed from an overall concept, actively put forward improvement suggestions, assist the factory director in correctly deciding on the central link of the current work, and put their own department's work in an appropriate subordinate position, changing the bias of emphasizing the work of their own business system. Secondly, it is necessary to help department staff establish a view of facing production and facing grassroots work. Department staff should specifically assist workers in implementing plans for improving production management and technical organizational measures, and promptly discover new problems in production, overcoming the phenomenon of department work being divorced from reality. Third, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the department staff's theoretical and business learning, educate them to carry forward the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, and educate them to be united, friendly, and cooperative. The Party organization should also urge the factory director to work hard to learn the business in order to truly realize the centralized and unified leadership of production.

The Party Committee Must Attach Importance to Implementing Soviet Expert Suggestions and Promoting Advanced Experiences

One of the main methods to continuously improve production technology and production management level is to promote advanced experiences, first of all, to promote Soviet advanced experiences and implement Soviet expert suggestions. At present, the situation of refusing to adopt Soviet advanced experiences or Soviet expert suggestions in factories and mines basically no longer exists. However, the phenomenon of passively coping still exists. The Yangjiazhangzi Mine has received a total of 135 suggestions from Soviet experts in the past three years. According to statistics at the end of the second quarter of this year, only 35 items have been implemented. The implementation of Soviet expert suggestions and the promotion of advanced experiences have also been severely hampered by empiricism and conservative thinking. Many people emphasize that the equipment is not good, the technical level is low, and the objective conditions are not sufficient, and they are unwilling to actively strive to create conditions to implement Soviet expert suggestions and promote advanced experiences. Some technicians still adhere to their own set of things and cannot quickly learn Soviet advanced technology. The failure of technicians and workers to cooperate closely is also a reason why advanced experiences cannot be well promoted. The influence of the opposition between technology and labor in the old society has not been completely eliminated. Technicians despise labor and do not take the initiative to approach workers, and workers also discriminate against technicians. In production, the two sides cannot cooperate, help each other, and carry forward the spirit of collective creation, which makes the promotion of advanced experiences lack necessary technical guidance. The reason why these obstacles cannot be eliminated in time is that the leading cadres, especially the leading cadres of the Party organization, take a laissez-faire attitude towards the promotion of Soviet advanced experiences and the implementation of Soviet expert suggestions. Some leading cadres of the Party Committee, trade union, and Communist Youth League believe that they are laymen, and Soviet expert suggestions and advanced experiences are technical issues and administrative matters, and therefore take a hands-off attitude or ask less questions, lack timely inspection and summarization of the implementation situation, and even do not know what suggestions Soviet experts have. Enterprise leading cadres, especially Party and mass work cadres, should regard the implementation of expert suggestions and the promotion of advanced experiences as important political and economic work, include it in the leadership work agenda, promote all employees to work hard to implement it, promote the administrative aspect to establish a special agency and set up a special person to be responsible, formulate practical and feasible plans, and at the same time strengthen political work and organize timely inspections, so that Soviet expert suggestions and various advanced experiences can be well implemented and promoted.

Adhere to the Correct Policy and Consolidate Labor Discipline

Rectifying labor discipline and conducting labor discipline education for the masses of employees is a long-term task for political workers in enterprises. This year, various factories and mines have successively carried out this work. The Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League should adhere to this work and make labor discipline education a regular task. At present, the phenomenon of lax labor discipline in enterprises is still quite common. It is necessary to correctly and concretely analyze the reasons for the lax labor discipline before implementing and adhering to the correct policy. In the past few years, industrial production has recovered and developed rapidly, and a large number of farmers, handicraftsmen, urban poor people, etc. have joined the ranks of the working class, and the free and undisciplined and selfish ideological style of small producers has also been brought to the ranks of the working class. Under this circumstance, there is an urgent need to conduct systematic political education and technical education to improve the class consciousness and technical level of new workers. However, in the past, our work in these areas was very weak. In addition, the planned management of factories and mines is not sound, and there is insufficient concern for the labor conditions and welfare of workers, which has led to widespread lax labor discipline. Some cadres only emphasized relying on the masses' consciousness and did not promptly deal with workers who seriously violated discipline, which further contributed to the lax discipline. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out work on rectifying labor discipline from many aspects, on the one hand, to educate the masses, establish and strengthen the concept of abiding by discipline among the masses, and on the other hand, to gradually establish and improve factory rules and regulations so that the masses understand what systems and discipline should be observed. When rectifying labor discipline, individual factories and mines once believed that the reason for poor labor discipline was entirely due to the backwardness of the workers, and therefore mistakenly adopted the method of punishing and investigating from top to bottom to replace enlightenment education. This practice is wrong and must be handled as a self-education problem within the working class. However, it is also wrong to think that workers who violate labor discipline can only be educated and cannot be given necessary punishments. Workers who repeatedly refuse to mend their ways and seriously violate discipline should be punished; at the same time, the majority of workers must be made to understand the reason for the punishment, so that the punishment can achieve the purpose of educating the masses.

    改进工厂矿山的政治工作
    中共辽西省委工业部部长  孙良才
    近半年来下了几次厂、矿，看到了厂矿工作的迅速发展与进步，同时看到了党的政治工作还落后于生产管理工作的需要。我们正在学习和采用苏联最科学的生产管理经验和最先进的技术成就，各厂矿广大工人群众的积极性和创造性特别高涨，和这些比较起来，政治工作还显得十分薄弱，因此必须加强政治工作。如何加强政治工作呢？我以为应注意以下几个问题。
    政治工作与经济工作必须密切结合
    任何一个工厂和矿山，不管它的规模有多大，工艺技术程序多么复杂，都是一个统一的生产整体。厂矿中管理机构和党、群组织的建立，都是为了组织生产，保证完成国家的生产计划，再没有其他目的。生产管理的责任，在于科学地组织生产过程与流通过程。政治工作者的责任在于及时统一全体职工的思想认识和行动，即在执行每一个新的任务或解决生产中的重大问题时，党委首先要用调查情况、学习文件的办法统一党、行政、工会、青年团等领导干部的认识。其次通过典型试验，用在实际过程中所证明了的理性认识，去统一全体干部的认识和行动；用重点试办中所创造出来的真人真事去宣传教育群众，克服各种错误思想；用重点试办中摸索出的经验，正确地指导工作的进行，同时，根据点的经验向面推广时所发现的新情况和新问题以及上级的新指示再来统一干部群众的认识，以推动工作不断向前发展。因此，管理工作和政治工作只是从不同方面采取不同的方法去完成同一的任务，二者绝对不能分割。在管理方面要建立责任制度，政治工作就要进行加强责任心的教育。二者是共同存在共同起作用的。但是，有些同志对这些问题却有片面的理解，他们把不同组织之间的必要的分工绝对化了，于是，产生了自立门户、独树旗帜、各自为政的思想，使政治工作在一定程度上脱离了当前生产管理工作。现在，厂矿中仍然相当普遍地存在着党和群众团体干部对管理工作的内容和重要性认识不足，管理干部对政治工作的重要性和内容认识不足的现象，因此存在政治工作和经济工作不能密切结合的现象。这对厂矿的生产是很不利的。因此，厂矿中的党委，必须根据国家法令、上级经济机关的计划、上级党委的指示，用加强党的思想领导的方法，以实现经济计划为中心，来统一各个组织的思想认识和行动。而厂矿中的行政负责干部应帮助党群工作干部，了解国家生产计划、生产过程和生产管理工作等各方面的问题，以便政治工作和经济工作密切结合。
    加强科室工作，克服分散主义，实现生产的统一领导
    近代化企业中的工艺技术程序是非常科学、细致而且复杂的。它要求生产管理的高度集中统一。这一方面需要建立厂长负责的生产区域管理制度，一方面又需要企业中的党组织时时注意克服工作中的分散现象。过去，很多企业是实行职能管理制的，各科室习惯各行其是地向下面发号施令，这是企业内部造成“五多”与分散主义的一个重要原因。实现了厂长制，但当厂长还没有十分熟悉业务以前，职能制的多头领导就仍然会在一定程度上复活起来。这样的情况是很多的。例如，阜新矿务局有二室、十三处、六十八个科。第二季度内，这些处、科曾连续向下面布置了安全生产、计划管理、建立责任制等八大项工作。一至五月份，他们用局长名义发文二千七百七十六件之多，其中在一个办公楼内办公的各处用局长名义互相行文就有一百一十六件。该局平安一坑坑长一个月内去局内开会就用了十八天的时间。这正是各科室只强调自己工作和领导干部心中无数的表现。今年夏天，有些厂矿在建立责任制时，各科室都争着把有关加强自己科室工作的责任制列为第一中心。这表现出科室干部缺乏关心全面情况的整体观念。有些厂矿的科室工作干部对问题认识常常也不统一，有些人习惯于只从自己工作的方便来考虑问题。比如在经济核算问题上，生产科的态度是：“生产需要啥就应该给啥，消耗定额超过点没啥”；基层生产单位是“宽打窄用”的思想；而成本科则是不管生产情况如何，死扣财务成本计划不放；在原始记录和统计表报方面，各科室也常自成系统，以致记录统计工作存在着不切实际、项目繁多、重复、目的性不明确等毛病。科室与科室、科室与车间以及科室内干部之间的不团结现象，也助长了科室工作中的分散主义倾向。
    因此，厂矿中的党组织必须加强科室的政治工作。首先，应该提高科室人员的政治思想水平，使他们正确认识，不论科室组织大小，都是厂长负责制的辅助机构。科室工作人员应该根据自己的职能很好地了解与分析厂矿的生产情况，从整体观念出发，积极提出改进意见，协助厂长正确地决定当前工作的中心环节，把自己部门的工作放在适当的从属地位，改变那种各自强调自己业务系统工作的偏向。其次，要帮助科室工作人员树立面向生产面向基层工作的观点，科室人员应该具体地协助工人贯彻执行改进生产管理与技术组织措施计划，并及时发现生产中的新问题，克服科室工作与实际脱节的现象。第三，必须加强对科室人员理论和业务学习的领导，教育他们发扬批评与自我批评的精神，教育他们要团结友爱和互助合作。党组织还应该督促厂长努力学习业务，以便真正实现对生产的集中统一的领导。
    党委必须重视贯彻苏联专家建议和推广先进经验
    生产技术和生产管理水平不断提高的主要方法之一是推广先进经验，首先是推广苏联先进经验和贯彻苏联专家建议。目前，厂矿中拒绝采用苏联先进经验或苏联专家建议的情况基本上已经不存在了。但是，消极应付的现象仍然存在。杨家杖子矿三年来苏联专家共提出建议一百三十五项。据今年第二季度末统计仅执行了三十五项。苏联专家建议的执行和先进经验的推广，还遭受到严重的经验主义和保守思想的障碍。很多人强调设备不好、技术水平低、客观条件不够等，而不肯积极努力创造条件去执行苏联专家建议和推广先进经验。部分技术人员仍然拘守于自己的一套，不能迅速地学习苏联的先进技术。技术人员和工人不能亲密合作，也是先进经验不能很好推广的一个原因。旧社会技术与劳动对立的影响尚未完全消灭。技术人员轻视劳动不主动接近工人，工人也歧视技术人员，在生产中两方面不能合作互助发扬集体创造精神，这就使推动先进经验缺乏必要的技术指导。这些障碍所以不能及时扫除，根本的原因还在于领导干部特别是党组织的领导干部对推广苏联先进经验和执行苏联专家建议采取放任自流的态度，有些党委、工会、青年团的领导干部认为自己是外行，苏联专家建议和先进经验是技术问题，是行政上的事，因而采取不闻不问或少管少问的态度，缺少对于执行情况的及时的检查总结，甚至还不清楚苏联专家有些什么建议。企业的领导干部，尤其是党和群众工作干部，应该把执行专家建议和推广先进经验当做重要的政治工作和经济工作，把它列入领导工作议程上，推动全体职工努力执行，推动行政方面建立专门机构设专人负责，制定切实可行的计划，同时加强政治工作，及时地组织检查，使苏联专家建议和各种先进经验能够很好地执行和推广。
    坚持正确方针，巩固劳动纪律
    整顿劳动纪律，对职工群众进行劳动纪律教育，是企业中政治工作者的一个长期任务。今年，各厂矿曾经先后进行了这一工作，党和工会、青年团应该把这一工作坚持下去，使劳动纪律的教育成为一项经常的工作。目前，企业中劳动纪律松懈的现象仍然相当普遍，必须正确地具体地分析劳动纪律松懈的原因，而后才能贯彻和坚持正确的政策。几年来工业生产迅速恢复与发展，大批农民、手工业者、城市贫民等参加到工人阶级队伍里来，小生产者的自由散漫、自私自利的思想作风也就随之带到工人阶级的队伍里。在这种情况下，迫切需要进行系统的政治教育和技术教育，以提高新工人的阶级觉悟和技术水平。但是，过去，我们在这些方面的工作都很薄弱。加上厂矿的计划管理还不健全，对工人的劳动条件和生活福利关心不够，以致使劳动纪律普遍松懈。有些干部只强调依靠群众自觉，而没有及时地对严重地违犯纪律的工人进行必要的处理，这就更助长了纪律松懈的现象。因此，必须从多方面进行关于整顿劳动纪律的工作，一方面教育群众，在群众中树立和加强遵守纪律的观点，一方面逐步地把厂规厂法建立和健全起来，使群众懂得应该遵守什么制度和纪律。在整顿劳动纪律时，个别厂矿曾经认为劳动纪律不好的原因完全是由于工人落后，因而错误地采取了自上而下的惩办追查的方法来代替启发教育。这种作法是错误的，必须把巩固劳动纪律当作工人阶级内部的自我教育问题来处理。但是如果认为对违犯劳动纪律的工人只能教育而不能进行必要的处分那也是不对的。对屡教不改的严重违犯纪律的工人是应该给以处分的；同时，必须使多数工人都能明白处分的道理，使处分能够达到教育群众的目的。
