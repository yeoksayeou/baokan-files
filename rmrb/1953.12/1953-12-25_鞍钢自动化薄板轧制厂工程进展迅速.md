The construction of China's first automated thin plate rolling mill at Anshan Iron and Steel Works has been progressing rapidly since its formal commencement in June this year. The civil engineering work has exceeded the planned targets every month. As of November 27th, it had exceeded the entire year's engineering plan by one month and three days ahead of schedule, and the quality meets the design requirements. In terms of installation engineering, the main machinery has already been installed. The installation work of industrial pipelines has completed about 70% of the total project volume.

Now, looking at the overall situation, the factory building, which is more than 20 meters high and has an area of more than 9,500 square meters, has been basically completed. The interior has been plastered, the surrounding walls have been built, bright glass has been installed on the windows, and the painted doors have been installed. The entire factory area, from south to north, from east to west, is filled with rows of neat new machines.

All the staff at the construction site are working hard on winter construction in order to put China's first automated thin plate rolling mill into production as soon as possible.

    鞍钢自动化薄板轧制厂工程进展迅速
    我国第一座自动化鞍钢薄板轧制厂工程从今年六月正式开工以来，土建工程月月都超额完成了计划，到十一月二十七日止，已提前一个月零三天超额完成了今年全年的工程计划，质量也都合乎设计要求。在安装工程方面，主要的机械已经安装完了。工业管道的安装工作，已完成全部工程量的百分之七十左右。
    现在，从总的情况来看，高有二十多公尺、面积九千五百多平方公尺的厂房工程已基本竣工，屋内已进行了粉刷，周围大墙也砌好了，窗上安上了通亮的玻璃，油漆的大门也安上了。整个厂地，从南至北，从东到西，布满了一排排整齐的新机器。
    工地全体职工，为了使我国第一座自动化薄板轧制厂早日投入生产，正紧张地进行冬季施工。
