    Urad Middle and Rear United Banner People's Bank Shows Bias in Issuing Agricultural and Pastoral Loans
    A letter from Zhang Zuochen of the Ulanqab League Autonomous Region People's Bank, Suiyuan Province: Some cadres of the Ulanqab League's Urad Middle and Rear United Banner People's Bank use "can afford to repay, can't afford to repay" as the loan standard when issuing agricultural and pastoral loans. This erroneous practice prevents some impoverished farmers and herders from receiving government loan assistance. Hao San, a poor farmer in the Seventh District of the banner, applied for a loan several times but was rejected by the bank. However, Yang Youen, a landlord in Taolaikou Village, and Duo Xiao, a rich peasant in Saimagou, received agricultural implement loans. This year, very few water conservancy loans were issued in the banner. Initially, the bank adopted a passive "wait for the masses to apply" attitude towards this work, without actively publicizing it to the masses. It was not until a drought began to appear in the area, and the Mongolian and Han farmers and herders, under the call of the Party and the government, launched a campaign to combat drought and protect seedlings and livestock, that the bank began to issue water conservancy loans. The villagers said, "It's a bit late to issue water conservancy loans now." When lending agricultural implements, the bank and cooperative cadres were also careless. For example, the "seven-inch walking plow" is only suitable for sandy soil, but the majority of the land in Qifenzi and other villages is clay soil, yet they were lent such plows as well. Many farmers who borrowed the seven-inch walking plow found it difficult to use, and some farmers who did not get the loan said, "You borrowed new-style plows, but you still have to watch us plow the land with old-style plows!" Farmer Mao Yanghuan was so angry that he carried the seven-inch walking plow to the town, willing to sell it at a loss. The People's Bank of the banner should conduct an in-depth inspection of the bias in the issuance of agricultural and pastoral loans and earnestly improve its work in the future.

### 乌拉特中后联合旗人民银行发放农牧贷款工作中有偏向

    乌拉特中后联合旗人民银行发放农牧贷款工作中有偏向
    绥远省乌兰察布盟自治区人民银行张作忱来信：乌兰察布盟乌拉特中后联合旗人民银行有些干部在发放农牧业贷款时，以申请贷款人“还得起、还不起”为贷款标准。这种错误做法就使部分贫苦的农民和牧民得不到政府贷款的扶助。该旗七区贫农郝三等申请贷款几次，都被银行拒绝；可是陶来口村地主杨有恩、腮马沟富农多萧倒得了农具贷款。该旗的水利贷款今年发放得很少。开始时银行对这项工作采取“坐等群众来贷”的应付态度，没有积极向群众进行宣传工作。直到该地旱灾开始呈现，蒙汉两族农牧人民在党和政府号召下展开了抗旱保苗保畜的工作，银行才去做发放水利贷款的工作。老乡们说：“现在才发放水利贷款，真有些晚了。”在贷放农具时，银行与合作社干部也都草率从事。如“七吋步犁”本来只适用于沙质土壤，而七分子等村大部分地是黏质土，同样也贷给了这样的犁。不少农民贷了七吋步犁不好使，有些没贷上的农民就说：“你们贷上了新式犁，还得坐着看我们用旧式犁耕地！”农民毛洋焕气得扛着七吋步犁到镇上，情愿赔钱出卖。该旗人民银行应该深入检查发放农牧贷款工作中的偏向，并在今后切实改进工作。
