Shanghai, the largest city in the Far East, yearned for by peace-loving people around the world, is now fighting tirelessly for national industrialization under the care of all the people of China.

People will remember the disaster that the "Treaty of Nanjing" brought to this city in 1842. The "January 28th Incident", the "August 13th Incident", the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang… all caused it severe damage. On the eve of liberation, the operating rate of various factories was less than 30%. But after the three years of recovery since liberation, this city has begun its true youth.

Shanghai possesses one-third of China's machine industrial equipment, accounting for 39.615% of the nation's spindles. It is producing a large number of materials needed for national construction and necessities for people's lives day and night. Every day, hundreds of thousands of tons of means of production and means of subsistence are transported to large and small cities and villages in the interior; to every corner of the motherland, by cars, ships, airplanes, from land, sea, rivers, and the sky. If Shanghai's output in 1951 is taken as 100, it increased by 50.73% in 1952, and in the first half of this year after the start of national construction, it grew rapidly by more than 77% compared with the same period last year. It is estimated that the equipment and materials transported to various places throughout the year will require five to six thousand medium-sized riverboats to transport. If these materials were to depart at the same time, with one ship sailing every half kilometer, these ships would stretch from the Wusongkou to Chongqing. If transported simultaneously by train, it would require more than 120,000 freight cars, which could stretch from the North Station of Shanghai all the way past Shanhaiguan.

The motherland's planned construction has begun. In the Northeast, the center of China's heavy industry, North China and Central South, rich in coal and iron, the Northwest and Southwest with their thousands of miles of oil fields, and the Huai River, Yellow River, and Yangtze River, there are many modern factories and projects to be built, urgently requiring a large number of talents. Since January of this year, Shanghai has transferred a large number of construction cadres with superb skills and rich experience to the state, including factory directors, engineers, experts, technicians, workers, etc. In order to support the construction of the First Automobile Factory, Shanghai organized a construction team of more than 10,000 people, including more than 200 technicians. This spring, the Shanghai steel industry department transferred more than 200 technicians at one time, including 52 engineers. The machine industry department also transferred a lot of technical cadres to support various places. They were assigned to many important design departments and large factories, mines, and railways under construction in our country. From Anshan, the steel capital of our country, the great Huai River project, the virgin lands being reclaimed in the Northwest frontier to the Tiancheng Railway, from Inner Mongolia to Kangzang, there are Shanghai technical cadres working everywhere. Shanghai has also equipped some textile equipment and transferred many cadres to the newly built textile factories in Beijing, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Handan and other places. Once the factory is completed, it can start the machines to spin yarn. In order to continuously meet the state's needs for talent, Shanghai has newly established three industrial technical schools since the second half of last year, and various factories have also promoted and trained a large number of new technical cadres. Many factories have equipped several sets of the same cadres in order to transfer them to the state in a timely manner.

In addition to directly transferring cadres to various places, Shanghai also undertakes the task of helping various places train cadres. Some come for internships, while others start from scratch. As the old saying goes: "It takes a hundred years to cultivate people," but now it is necessary to train an ordinary worker into a fourth-grade technician within a year and a half. They come from large factories and mines under construction in various parts of our country and the original large iron and steel machinery factories. The famous Shanghai Machine Tool Factory has trained 50 technicians for various places in the past year, and is currently training another 60. They come from dozens of units including the First Automobile Manufacturing Factory, the Three Northeast Factories, the Northwest First Machine Factory, the Hunan Machine Factory, and the Central Heavy Industry Department. The subjects of study include lathe, milling, grinding, quenching, inspection, and so on.

Shanghai has supplied the whole country with a large number of construction materials and various parts this year on an unprecedented scale. From various steel products, power machines, metal cutting machines, civil engineering construction machines to various tools, instruments and power controllers, the quantity is counted in tens of thousands of tons or pieces. There are also electric wires and cables that can circle the earth twice. The output of all these materials has greatly increased compared with last year. According to statistics from state-owned, local state-owned and joint state-private factories, from January to July this year compared with the same period last year, steel increased by 105.97%, generators increased by 138.51%, and bare copper wire was 221.39% of last year. The production of the state-owned Shanghai Electric Motor Factory increased 47 times last year compared with before liberation, and from January to August this year, it increased by 136.8% compared with the same period last year. Private factories have also seen great growth. Last year, the state processed and ordered 1,300 machine tools, but this year it has increased by nearly two times. The production of civil engineering construction machinery will reach five times that of last year. Many factories that produced textile machines last year have begun to manufacture mother machines this year, and 101 of the more than 700 electrical machinery and appliance factories are newly added this year.

Many factories not only completed or exceeded production targets, but more importantly, produced many new products, including sand and gravel conveyors for infrastructure construction, equivalent to a large mixing plant, which can mechanize the entire process of prefabricated concrete; lightweight rails for mines, forests, and construction sites; vacuum filters weighing 14 tons for smelting, wet ball mills weighing 20 tons, gas generators, vacuum pumps, and crushers capable of crushing 50 tons of ore per hour, etc.; large power equipment that is being trial-produced that can supply power to a factory with three 50,000-spindle units, 1,000 looms, or lighting electricity for a city of 300,000 people—6,000 kW steam turbine generators; new machines for manufacturing machines such as 18-foot lathes, hydraulic grinders, vertical and surface milling machines, and five-purpose punching and shearing machines. The Shanghai Machine Tool Factory is now also starting to trial-produce the world-class Soviet-style 373 flat grinder; large cranes with a lifting capacity of 100 tons; hoist and huge gate for water conservancy construction. In addition, there are dozens of Soviet-style cables, large oil circuit breakers, and control switches for automated machinery. In the light industry sector, there are also many new products, such as 200 cm X-ray machines for medical use, sounding instruments for navigation, and other major machinery and instruments.

These products are supplied to important construction sites and factories and mines across the country. The 70-odd types of steel produced by the iron and steel industry meet the needs of more than 400 industrial and mining enterprises across the country. Lightweight steel rails will be laid into hundreds of miles of forest railways in the Northeast forest area to transport timber. The iron and steel and machinery industries supplied more than 3,000 tons of gates and high-pressure gates to the upper and lower reaches of the Huai River reservoirs, ship locks, river dams, and the Guanting Reservoir in North China, making floods tame and serve agriculture. The electric motors, generators, and various machine tools manufactured by the machinery industry spread throughout the large and small factories, mines, and cities across the country, making them emit light and heat. The 100,000-spindle textile equipment manufactured by the textile machinery factory this year has equipped the newly built textile factories in Zhengzhou and Handan. The large oil circuit breakers produced by the Huatong Electric Motor Factory and the high-voltage cables of the Shanghai Electric Wire Factory have provided conditions for the establishment of a huge power grid in the Yangtze River Delta. The oil mine cable successfully trial-produced by the Shanghai Electric Wire Factory has made an important contribution to China's petroleum industry, and can be used to detect the composition and quality of oil sources under the strata. The long-distance telephone line between Chongqing and Dihua was connected for the first time by the electric wires supplied by the factory.

With the development of national construction and the improvement of people's economic lives, Shanghai has also supplied a large number of daily necessities to the country this year. Tens of thousands of stevedores are constantly carrying these goods onto trains and ships day and night, including floral fabrics that girls like, the "worker-peasant blue" that workers and peasants love to wear, the gold pens that young students hope for, and the silks and georgettes that ethnic minorities love, and so on. The production of cotton textiles, silk textiles, woolen textiles, knitted goods and cotton textile reproductions, as well as various daily necessities and reproduction foods, which are most needed by the people, has increased compared with the same period last year. According to statistics from January to July, cotton yarn increased by 15.56%, cotton cloth increased by 16.54%, and cigarettes were 256.21% of last year. The monthly output of gold pens, rubber shoes, and thermos bottles has more than doubled compared with last year. If the output of cotton cloth this year is calculated according to the ratio in the first half of the year (in fact, it will increase in the second half of the year), it will be about 1.1 billion meters. These fabrics account for 39.87% of the cotton cloth produced nationwide. The output of cotton yarn accounts for 35.26% of the national total. If each piece of yarn is 0.6 meters high, all the yarn can be piled up to be as high as forty Mount Everest, the highest peak in the world. The output of cigarettes can provide two packs of twenty cigarettes for everyone in the country. This year's supply plan is also much larger than last year's. The supply of cotton cloth in the second half of the year increased by 43.36% compared with the same period last year, and the supply of small commodities exceeded the total value of the supply for the whole year last year. These products sell well all over the country, from the Northeast to South China, from the coast of the Yellow Sea to Yili City under the Tianshan Mountains, there are Shanghai products everywhere.

However, the people are demanding more and better things. Shanghai has made great efforts this year to meet the growing needs of the people, adding a large number of new varieties and colors to various daily necessities, and continuously improving product quality. The rate of first-class fabrics produced by some cotton textile factories and printing and dyeing factories and the pass rate of products from some light industrial factories have reached more than 99%. This effort is being continuously strengthened and consolidated, and will undoubtedly produce more high-quality products for the people of various places.

Shanghai workers have demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity, completing the national plan ahead of schedule to support national construction. When the workers of the Huadong Steel Structure Factory, which manufactures steel structures, accepted the task of the First Automobile Manufacturing Factory in China, they called this construction site the front line and put forward the slogan "What the front line needs, the rear will supply," and strived to supply the machines for installation ahead of schedule. In order to ensure the completion of the gates of the Sanhekou control gate of the Huai River flood storage project before the summer flood season, they launched a movement to find tricks to improve production efficiency by 50% and complete the plan 25 days ahead of schedule. The Huatong Electric Motor Factory launched a labor competition to complete the order for universal converters for the Anshan seamless steel pipe factory ahead of schedule. The workers who went to Shihezi City in Xinjiang and Linxia City in Gansu to install generators used their hands to bring light to these cities. How happy and excited they were.

In order to complete the national plan, workers have promoted many new working methods this year, improving production efficiency. The Shanghai No. 3 Steel Factory created the "light rail one-time rolling method," which increased production efficiency by 60%. The large number of new tools created and improved by Shanghai construction workers have increased the efficiency of many jobs by three to one hundred times. After the promotion of a complete set of improved whitewashing equipment in 20,000 houses in Shanghai, it saved the state 7 billion yuan. The three-core 300-volt power cable manufactured by the Shanghai Electric Wire Factory according to Soviet standards saves 30% of materials compared with the old standards, while the current passed is three times more than the old ones.

V

With the needs of national construction, Shanghai's industry itself has also begun to undergo major changes. In the past year, the management of many factories has begun to get on the right track, and a good start has been made in the implementation of planned management. Due to strengthening planned management and establishing a responsibility system, the state-owned No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory completed the value of output, product and quality plans month by month from January to August. Due to the implementation of the operation plan, the Xinhua Iron and Steel Factory completed 89.6% of the annual value of output plan in eight months.

At the same time, since we do not yet have comprehensive large factories, national construction has put forward the necessity of organizing joint production in Shanghai's industry. In this regard, Shanghai's industrial production sector has also made a good start. The Shanghai Electric Motor Factory, the Shanghai Boiler Factory, and the Shanghai Turbine Factory have jointly started trial-producing 6,000 kW turbine generators. Many private factories have also begun to be organized by division of labor to process orders for the state and have been gradually incorporated into the track of the national plan under the leadership of the state-owned economy. In order to complete the tasks given by the state, they are studying and designing new specifications to make the quality, performance, and material standards of the same type of products consistent, and prepare conditions for organizing unified processing and joint production in the future.

However, Shanghai is still a city with huge potential capacity, and the utilization rate of many industrial equipment is only 50%. Now, the city is launching a comprehensive and large-scale production increase and economy campaign to over fulfill the national plan. Through this movement, Shanghai's production capacity will be further exploited, and in the second year of the national construction plan, Shanghai will contribute greater strength.

    在国家建设计划第一年的上海
    艾长青
    上海，世界爱好和平的人民向往着的远东最大的城市，现在正在全中国人民的关怀下，为国家工业化而战斗不懈。
    人们会记得一八四二年“南京条约”给这个城市带来的灾难。“一·二八”、“八·一三”、蒋匪帮……曾使它遭受严重的破坏，到解放前夕，各业工厂的开工率不足百分之三十。但解放以后，经过过去三年的恢复，这座城市已开始了它真正的青春。
    上海拥有我国机器工业设备的三分之一；占了全国纱锭的百分之三十九点六一五。它日夜不息地在生产着国家建设所需要的大批器材和人民生活必需品。每天，都有成千上万吨的生产资料与生活资料，用车、船、飞机，从陆上、海洋、江河以及天空，运往内地的大、小城市和乡村；运往祖国的各个角落。上海的输出量如以一九五一年为一百，一九五二年增加了百分之五十点七三，而在国家建设开始后的今年上半年，则比去年同期迅速增长了百分之七十七以上。估计全年运往各地的器材、物资，将要五千到六千艘中型江轮才能运出，如果这些物资要同时启运，按每半公里的距离航行一艘，这些船只将从吴淞口排到重庆。如果以火车同时运载，则需要十二万多节车皮，这些车皮可从上海的北站一直顶过山海关。
    一
    祖国有计划的建设开始了。在我国重工业中心的东北、煤铁丰富的华北和中南、油田千里的西北和西南，以及淮河、黄河和长江，有着许多近代化的工厂和工程需要建设，急切地需要着大量的人材。自今年一月以来，上海已向国家输送了大批技术精湛、经验丰富的建设干部，其中包括厂长、工程师、专家、技术人员、工人等等，为支援第一汽车厂的兴建，上海即组织了一万多人的建筑队伍，其中有二百多名技术人员。在今年春天，上海钢铁工业部门一次就抽调了二百多名技术人员，其中包括五十二名工程师。机器工业部门也抽调了不少技术干部支援各地，他们被分配到我国许多重要的设计部门和正在兴建中的大的工厂、矿山和铁路，从我国钢铁之都的鞍山、伟大的淮河工程、被开垦的处女地的西北边疆到天成铁路上，从内蒙到康藏，到处都有着上海的技术干部在那里工作。在北京、西安、郑州、邯郸等地新建的纺织厂，上海也配备了部分纺织设备和输送了不少干部。一旦工厂落成，就可以开动机器纺纱了。为了继续不断地满足国家人材的需要，从去年下半年起上海新办了三所工业技术学校，各个工厂也提拔和培养了大批新的技术干部，有许多工厂配备了几套同样的干部，以便及时输送给国家。
    上海除了直接输送给各地的干部以外，还担负了帮助各地训练干部的任务，有的是来实习，有的则是从头学起。古语说：“百年树人”，而现在却要在一年半之内把一个普通的工人培养成为四级技工。他们来自我国各地正在兴建中的大的厂矿和原有的大的钢铁机器厂。著名的上海机床厂，一年来，已为各地代训了五十名技工，现在正在训练的还有六十名。他们来自第一汽车制造厂、东北三厂、西北第一机器厂、湖南机器厂、中央重工业部等等数十个单位。学习的科目包括车、铣、磨、粹火、检验等等。
    二
    上海在今年空前规模地供给了全国大量的建筑器材和各种机件。从各种钢材、动力机、金属切削机、土木建筑机一直到各种工具、仪器和电力控制器等等，其数量要以万吨或万件计。还有可绕地球两周的电线电缆。所有这些器材的产量都比去年有很大的增长。据国营、地方国营与公私合营工厂的统计，今年一至七月与去年同期相比，钢材增加百分之一百零五点九七，发电机增加百分之一百三十八点五一，裸铜线为去年的百分之二百二十一点三九。国营上海电机厂的生产，去年比解放前增长四十七倍，而今年一至八月则又比去年同期增长了百分之一百三十六点八。私营厂也有很大的增长，去年国家加工订货的工具机一千三百台，今年则增加将近两倍。土木建筑机械的生产将达去年的五倍。许多去年生产纺织机的工厂今年已开始制造工作母机，七百多家的电机电器厂有一百零一家是今年新增的。
    许多工厂不仅完成或超过了生产指标，尤其重要的是出产了许多新的产品，其中有供应基本建设用的砂石运输机，相当于一座较大的搅拌工厂，可以使预制混凝土的全部过程机械化；有供矿山、森林、建筑工地用的轻便道轨；有供冶炼用的十四吨重的真空过滤器、二十吨重的湿式球磨机、煤气发生炉、真空泵和每小时破矿五十吨的碎石机等等；有正在试制中的可供三个五万纱锭，一千台布机的工厂的动力或三十万人口的城市的照明用电的巨大动力设备——六千瓩蒸气透平发电机；有十八呎车床、液压磨床、立式和平面铣床、五用冲剪机等等制造机器的新机器，上海机床厂现在又开始试制世界第一流的苏联式三七三型的平面磨床；有吊重一百吨的大行车；有供水利建设用的启闭机和巨大的闸门。此外，还有数十种苏式电缆，大型的油断路器和供自动化机械上装的控制开关等等。在轻工业方面，也有不少新的产品，如供医疗用的二○○糎的X光机，航行用的测深仪等等主要机械和仪器。
    这些产品供给了全国重要的工地和厂矿。钢铁工业生产的七十多种钢材，供给了全国四百多个工矿企业的需要，轻便钢轨将在东北森林区铺成几百里的森林铁道，把木材运出来。钢铁和机器工业供给了淮河上下游水库、船闸、拦河坝和华北的官厅水库等地三千多吨闸门和高压闸门，使洪水驯服地服务于农业。机械工业制造的电动机、发电机以及各种工具机遍及全国的大小工厂、矿山和城市，使它们发出光和热。纺织机械厂今年制造完成的十万纱锭纺纱设备，装备了郑州和邯郸等地新建的纺织厂。华通电机厂出产的大型油断路器和上海电线厂的高压电缆，为在长江三角洲上建立巨大的电力网提供了条件。上海电线厂试制成功的油矿电缆对我国石油工业作了重要贡献，可以通过它察知地层下的油源成分和质量。重庆和迪化之间由该厂供给的电线第一次架通了长途电话。
    三
    随着国家建设的发展和人民经济生活的上升，上海也在今年大量的供应了全国以生活必需品。数以万计的搬运工人日夜不停地把这些货物搬上火车、轮船，其中有姑娘们喜欢的花布、工人农民爱穿的“工农蓝”、青年学生希望的金笔、兄弟民族喜爱的丝绸和乔其纱等等。人民生活最需要的棉织品、丝织品、毛织品、针织品和棉织复制品，以及各种日用百货和复制食品等，今年的生产都比去年同期增长，据一至七月的统计，棉纱增加百分之十五点五六，棉布增产百分之十六·五四，香烟为去年的百分之二百五十六点二一。金笔、胶鞋和热水瓶等的月产量都比去年增加一倍以上。今年棉布的产量，如按上半年的比例不变（事实上下半年会增加）计算，约在十一亿公尺左右，这些布匹占全国生产棉布的百分之三十九点八七。棉纱的产量占全国百分之三十五点二六。如果以每件纱高零点六公尺计，全部纱可以堆成四十个世界第一高峰的珠穆朗玛峰那样高。香烟的产量可供全国每个人获得两条二十支装的香烟。今年的供应计划也比去年大得多，下半年的棉布供应量比去年同期增加百分之四十三点三六，小百货超过了去年全年供应量的总值。这些产品畅销全国各地，从东北到华南，从黄海之滨到天山下的伊犁城，都有着上海的产品。
    但是，人民要求着更多更好的东西。上海今年作了巨大的努力来满足人民日益增长的需要，在各类生活必需品中增添了大量的新的品种和花色，并不断地提高了产品质量，有些棉纺织厂和印染厂出产的正布率以及若干轻工业工厂产品的合格率都达到了百分之九十九以上。这种努力并在不断的加强与巩固，无疑将会生产出更多的品质优良的产品供给各地人民。
    四
    上海工人发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，提早完成国家计划支援全国建设。制造钢铁结构的华东钢铁建筑厂的工人们在接受了中国第一汽车制造厂的任务时，他们把这个工地称为前方，提出了“前方需要什么，后方就供应什么”的口号，努力提前供应安装用的机器。他们为了保证在夏汛之前完成淮河蓄洪工程三河口控制闸闸门的任务，展开了找窍门运动，使生产效率提高了百分之五十，提前二十五天完成计划。华通电机厂在提前完成鞍山无缝钢管厂万能转换控制器定货时，展开了劳动竞赛。前往新疆石河子城和甘肃临夏市安装发电机的工人们，以他们的双手使这些城市发出了光明。他们是多么愉快和兴奋。
    为了完成国家计划，工人们一年来推行了许多新的工作法，使生产效率提高。上钢三厂创造了“轻轨一次轧成法”生产效率提高百分之六十。上海的建筑工人们创造和改进的大批新工具，有许多工作的效率提高了三倍到一百倍。在上海二万户工房中推广全套改良粉墙器后，便为国家节约了七十亿元。上海电线厂按照苏联标准制造的三蕊三百伏的电力电缆，比旧标准节省材料百分之三十，而通过的电流则比旧的多三倍。
    五
    随着国家建设的需要，上海工业本身也开始发生了重大的变化。一年来，许多工厂的经营管理工作已开始走入正轨，在实行计划管理上作了良好的开端。国营第二棉纺织厂由于加强计划管理、建立了责任制，一至八月逐月完成了产值、产品和质量计划。新沪钢铁厂，由于贯彻了作业计划，八个月完成了全年产值计划的百分之八十九点六。
    同时，由于我们还没有综合性的大工厂，国家建设便在上海工业面前提出了组织起来进行联合生产的必要。在这方面，上海的工业生产部门也作了良好的开始。上海电机厂、上海锅炉厂与上海轮机厂三厂已联合起来开始试制着六千瓩的透平发电机。许多私营工厂也已开始有分工地组织起来为国家加工订货，在国营经济的领导下，逐步纳入国家计划的轨道。为了完成国家给予的任务，它们正在研究和设计新的规格，使同型产品的质量、性能和用料标准一致，为今后组织统一加工和联合生产准备条件。
    但是，上海仍然是一座蕴藏着巨大潜在能力的城市，还有不少工业设备的利用率不过百分之五十。现在，全市正在开展着一个全面的规模巨大的增产节约运动，以超额完成国家计划。通过这个运动，上海的生产能力将进一步被发掘出来，在国家建设计划的第二年，上海将贡献更大的力量。
