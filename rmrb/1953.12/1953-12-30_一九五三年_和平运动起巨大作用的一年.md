Xinhua News Agency: 1953 was a year in which the peace movement rapidly expanded its influence and its forces played a significant role in international affairs.

    In 1953, under the influence of the peaceful policies of the Soviet Union, China, and the various People's Democratic countries, post-war international tensions eased somewhat. The Soviet government consistently strived for the cause of peace and solemnly declared that there was no dispute, including relations with the United States, that could not be resolved peacefully. The efforts made by the Chinese and Korean sides to resume the Korean armistice talks created the conditions for achieving peace in Korea. These facts encouraged the confidence of people of all countries in striving for a peaceful resolution of international disputes. Reflecting the wishes of the people of all countries, the World Peace Council, at its Budapest meeting in June, adopted the "Declaration on Launching a World Movement for Negotiation," calling on the people of all countries to use their own strength to strive for negotiation and thwart the provocative conspiracies of the forces of war.
    After the Budapest meeting of the World Peace Council, with the active efforts of the Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world, the Korean armistice was finally achieved. The Korean armistice created favorable conditions for further easing international tensions. In the face of the strong demand of the people for negotiation, the war forces, headed by the United States, had to pretend to be willing to negotiate in order to continue maintaining international tensions. Therefore, distinguishing between true and false negotiation in the eyes of the masses of the people has become one of the most important tasks of the peace movement at present. The Vienna meeting of the World Peace Council, held under these circumstances, pointed out that genuine negotiation must be aimed at easing international tensions and must not be subject to any preconditions. In order to broadly review the issue of easing international tensions, a meeting of the five major powers, including China, must be held. This is the general goal of action set by the Vienna meeting for the people of all countries.
    A significant feature of the peace movement in 1953 was that the idea of negotiation was grasped by millions of people and had a tremendous impact on international political life. The people of all countries have gradually realized that as long as they take on the cause of peace, they have the power to defend it. In many countries, the word "peace" was taboo a few years ago, but today it has become the unanimous call of millions of people.
    For example, in Britain, those who talked about peace were previously called "hypocrites" by the bourgeois press, but this year, the demand for peaceful negotiation has become a common aspiration of the British people. At the annual meetings of 31 trade union organizations held this year, 18 trade union organizations passed resolutions calling for great power negotiation. In the six weeks from June to July, more than 30,000 people signed appeals to Members of Parliament calling for great power negotiation. The movement launched by the Britain-China Friendship Association in September to ensure the success of the Korean political conference was supported by more than 300 organizations, including trade unions and cooperatives. In Brazil, in Latin America, the first Brazilian Peace Congress held in 1949 was dispersed by armed police, but this year, the situation has greatly changed, and the movement for negotiation has made great progress. The national Brazilian referendum on peaceful settlement of international disputes, which began on September 1, is still underway. Many prominent Brazilians, including 189 members of Congress who hold an absolute majority in the House of Representatives, jointly issued a letter to the people expressing their support for the referendum. In many other countries in Europe, Asia, and the Americas, the negotiation movement has made great progress. Even in the United States, despite the reactionaries' efforts to spread lies, the idea of negotiation is increasingly taking root in people's hearts.
    Another feature of the peace movement in 1953 was that the people of all countries increasingly closely integrated the overall goal of striving to ease international tensions with various current specific struggles. The people of all countries are increasingly aware that only by achieving victory in the current specific struggles can the entire international situation gradually ease. In France, people from all walks of life are combining the movement against the "European Army" and for a peaceful settlement of the Vietnam issue with easing international tensions. The unity shown by the French people in opposing the "European Army" has never been seen since the French resistance movement against the German fascist occupation during World War II. The widespread and strong opposition of the French people is the basic reason why the parliament has not yet ratified the "European Army" treaty. A mass signature campaign calling for an end to the Vietnam War is also underway throughout France, and the unanimous sentiment of the people against the Vietnam War has also affected the members of bourgeois political parties in the French parliament. In 1948, only five non-Communist members of the French parliament voted against the Vietnam War, but this year, when the French parliament debated the Vietnam issue in October, the number of non-Communist members of parliament who voted against the Vietnam War had increased to 151.
    The struggle of the people of all countries against the construction of military bases by the United States on foreign territories has also developed this year. In Denmark and Norway, under the pressure of the people, the newly formed governments after the parliamentary elections have had to refuse the United States to establish military bases in their countries. In Latin America, representatives of all parties and all strata in Chile have established the Committee for the Defense of Chilean Sovereignty this year, uniting the people to work for the abolition of the Chilean-US military agreement. In Asia, the US attempt to build bases in Pakistan has been met with unanimous opposition from the people of Pakistan, India, and other Asian countries.
    In Western Europe, Asia, and Latin America, the scale of the struggle of the people of all countries against the US "embargo" policy, demanding the development of normal trade, and striving for economic independence has also grown this year.
    The peace movement has put forward the proposition of resolving international disputes through negotiation and has summarized the issues that the people of all countries are most concerned about into the overall goal of easing international tensions, thereby gaining the support of the people of all countries and further expanding the ranks of the peace movement. This year, national peace conferences have been held in Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Denmark, Australia, and Japan. National peace conferences will be held in Austria, Canada, Chile, Indonesia, and other countries in early next year. These conferences all represent a new and more powerful unity of peace forces in various countries under the common goal of striving for further easing of the international situation.
    Based on the rapid development of the peace movement in 1953, 1954 will be a year in which the peace movement achieves greater success. According to the resolution of the Vienna meeting of the World Peace Council, a world peace assembly will be held in 1954. This assembly will bring together all organizations and individuals who support peace to fight for five-power negotiation and further easing of the international situation.

    一九五三年——和平运动起巨大作用的一年
      【新华社讯】一九五三年，是和平运动迅速扩大影响、和平运动的力量在国际事务中起着巨大作用的一年。
    一九五三年，在苏联、中国和各人民民主国家和平政策的影响之下，战后国际紧张局势有了一些缓和。苏联政府曾坚持不渝地为和平事业而奋斗，并郑重宣布，没有任何纠纷，包括和美国的关系在内，不能和平解决；中朝方面为恢复朝鲜停战谈判所作的努力，创造了在朝鲜实现和平的条件。这些事实鼓舞了各国人民争取和平解决国际争端的信心。世界和平理事会反映了各国人民的愿望，在六月间举行的布达佩斯会议上通过了“展开世界争取协商运动”宣言，号召各国人民用自己的力量来争取协商，并挫败战争势力的挑衅阴谋。
    世界和平理事会布达佩斯会议以后，在中朝人民和世界人民的积极争取之下，朝鲜停战终于实现了。朝鲜停战为进一步缓和国际紧张局势创造了有利条件。在人民要求协商的强大呼声面前，以美国为首的战争势力，也不得不假装出愿意协商的姿态。他们企图以他们的所谓“协商”来破坏真正的协商，以达到继续维持国际紧张局势的目的。因此，在人民群众面前区别真、假协商，就成了和平运动当前最重要的任务之一。在这种情况下举行的世界和平理事会维也纳会议，指出了真正的协商必须是以缓和国际紧张局势为目的、不附有任何先决条件的协商。为了广泛审查缓和国际局势的问题，必须举行包括中国在内的五大国会议。这就是维也纳会议给各国人民所规定的总的行动目标。
    一九五三年和平运动显著的特点是：协商思想掌握了千百万人民，并已对国际政治生活产生了巨大的影响。各国人民已逐渐认识到：只要把和平事业担当起来，人民是有力量保卫和平的。在许多国家里，几年前“和平”还是犯忌讳的字眼，今天已经成为千百万人的一致呼声了。
    例如在英国，谈论和平的人从前被资产阶级报刊叫做“伪善者”，但在今年，要求和平协商已成为英国人民的普遍愿望。在今年举行的三十一个工会组织的年会上，有十八个工会组织通过了要求大国协商的决议。从六月到七月的六个星期中，有三万多人在致议会议员要求举行大国协商的呼吁书上签了名。英中友好协会在九月间发起的确使朝鲜政治会议成功的运动，得到了包括工会与合作社在内的三百多个组织的支持。在拉丁美洲的巴西，一九四九年举行的第一次巴西和平大会，曾被武装警察所驱散，但在今年，情况已有很大变化，争取协商的运动有了巨大的发展。从九月一日开始的巴西全国争取协商解决国际争端的公民投票，到现在还在进行中。许多巴西的著名人士，包括占众议院绝对多数的一百八十九个众议员在内，联名发表了告人民书，表示支持这次公民投票。在欧洲、亚洲和美洲的许多其他国家，协商运动都有了巨大的发展。甚至在美国，尽管反动派竭力散布谎言，协商思想也正日益深入人心。
    一九五三年和平运动的另一特点是：各国人民把争取缓和国际紧张局势的总目标，和当前各项具体斗争日益密切地结合起来。各国人民日益认识到：只有在当前的具体斗争中取得胜利，才能使整个国际局势逐步趋于缓和。在法国，各阶层人民正把反对“欧洲军”与争取和平解决越南问题的运动，和缓和国际紧张局势结合起来。法国人民在反对“欧洲军”上所表现的一致，是从第二次世界大战期间法国反抗德国法西斯占领的抵抗运动以来所从来没有过的。法国人民普遍而强烈的反对，是议会至今没有批准“欧洲军”条约的基本原因。要求停止越南战争的群众签名运动也正在法国各地进行，人民反对越南战争的一致情绪，使法国议会中的资产阶级政党的议员也受到影响。一九四八年法国议会中投票反对越南战争的非共产党议员只有五人，而今年十月法国议会辩论越南问题时，投票反对越南战争的非共产党议员已增至一百五十一人。
    各国人民反对美国在外国领土建筑军事基地的斗争，今年也有了发展。在丹麦和挪威，在人民的压力之下，已使议会选举以后新成立的政府不能不拒绝美国在它们国家内建立军事基地。在拉丁美洲，智利各党派和各阶层的代表已在今年成立了保卫智利主权委员会，团结人民为取消智利和美国的军事协定而努力。在亚洲，美国企图在巴基斯坦建筑基地的阴谋，已遭到巴基斯坦、印度和亚洲其他国家人民的一致反对。
    在西欧、亚洲和拉丁美洲，各国人民反对美国的“禁运”政策、要求发展正常贸易、争取经济独立斗争的规模，今年也越来越大了。
    和平运动提出了通过协商来解决国际争端的主张，并且把各国人民当前最关心的问题归结到缓和国际紧张局势的总目标，因而得到各国人民的拥护，使和平运动的队伍更进一步扩大了。今年，英、法、意、德、丹、澳和日本等国家都已举行了全国性的和平大会，奥地利、加拿大、智利、印度尼西亚等国家将在明年初举行全国性和平大会，这些大会都表示着各国和平力量在争取国际局势进一步缓和的共同目标下的新的和更有力的团结。
    在和平运动一九五三年迅速发展的基础上，一九五四年将是和平运动取得更大成就的一年。根据世界和平理事会维也纳会议的决议，一九五四年将召开世界性的和平集会，这个集会将使一切赞成和平的组织和个人聚集一堂，为争取五大国协商、进一步缓和国际局势而奋斗。
