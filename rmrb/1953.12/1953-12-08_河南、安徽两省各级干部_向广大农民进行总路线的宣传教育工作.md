Cadres at All Levels in Henan and Anhui Provinces
Conduct Propaganda and Education on the General Line for the Broad Masses of Farmers

Since studying the general line for the transition period in the country, cadres at all levels in Henan and Anhui provinces have universally improved their political consciousness and work enthusiasm. Currently, cadres in various regions are conducting propaganda and education on the general line for the broad masses of farmers.

In Henan Province, since October, cadres at the provincial, prefectural, county, district, and township levels have begun studying the general line for the transition period. All 117 counties in the province have convened enlarged meetings of district and township cadres, and 98 counties have convened party representative meetings. The cadres participating in the study have all examined their own thoughts and work in accordance with the spirit of the general line. In the latter half of November, all 68 counties in Anhui Province also universally convened three-level cadre meetings at the county, district, and township levels to convey and study the general line.

In the process of studying the general line, cadres in Henan and Anhui clarified various confused ideas about the direction of rural economic development and clearly recognized the necessity of leading farmers to the road of socialism. During their studies, cadres in various counties in Henan criticized the tendency to only see the immediate interests of farmers while neglecting to educate them about the socialist future. Some cadres examined their mistakes in treating the individual economic enthusiasm and mutual aid and cooperation enthusiasm displayed by farmers after the land reform equally, promoting free practices such as lending and hiring labor on par with the mutual aid and cooperation movement. In their work, they also one-sidedly understood the principles derived from the characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy, relaxing the work of carrying out socialist transformation of the small-scale peasant economy. Cadres in many counties in Anhui Province, during their studies, examined their past failure to clearly recognize the reasons for the individual buying and selling of land by farmers and the disintegration of mutual aid teams, even though they saw the ever-changing new look of the countryside. They now realize that this is a manifestation of the blind spontaneous forces of the small-scale peasant economy. To overcome these blind spontaneous forces, the only way is to lead farmers to the road of mutual aid and cooperation and strengthen their socialist transformation. In addition, after some cadres recognized the interrelationship between agricultural development and industrial development, they enthusiastically sold their surplus grain to the state. In Dangtu County, more than 250 cadres voluntarily signed up to sell their surplus grain to the state during the study.

Currently, cadres at all levels in Henan and Anhui, having completed their studies, are extensively conducting propaganda and education on the general line for the transition period among farmers. People's representative conferences, farmer representative congresses, and various activist meetings are currently being held in various townships in Henan Province to convey and study the general line. After these meetings conclude, a vigorous propaganda campaign will be launched in the rural areas throughout the province. The cadres in Anhui Province who participated in the study have now returned to their work posts and have begun to conduct propaganda and education on the general line among farmers. After cadres in the nine agricultural production cooperatives and more than fifty mutual aid teams in Northwest Township of Su County led the study of the general line, they all expressed their intention to further consolidate and develop mutual aid and cooperative organizations and do a good job in winter production.

    河南、安徽两省各级干部
    向广大农民进行总路线的宣传教育工作
    河南、安徽两省各级干部学习国家过渡时期的总路线后，政治觉悟和工作热情普遍提高，目前各地干部正向广大农民进行总路线的宣传和教育。
    河南省自十月份起，省、专区、县及区、乡各级干部即开始国家过渡时期总路线的学习。全省一百十七个县都召开了区、乡干部扩大会议，并有九十八个县召开了党代表会议。参加学习的干部，都根据总路线的精神检查了自己的思想和工作。安徽省六十八个县在十一月下半月，也普遍召开了县、区、乡三级干部大会，传达和学习了总路线。
    河南、安徽各地干部在学习总路线中，澄清了对农村经济发展方向的各种糊涂观念，明确认识了必需领导农民走向社会主义的道路。河南各县干部在学习中，批判了只看到农民的眼前利益，而忽视对农民进行社会主义前途的教育。有些干部检查到在土地改革后对农民所表现的个体经济积极性和互助合作积极性平列看待的错误，把农村中的借贷、雇工等自由和互助合作运动同等提倡；并在工作中将从小农经济的特点出发的道理片面理解，而放松了对小农经济实行社会主义改造的工作。安徽省许多县的干部在学习中，检查出过去只看到农村面貌越变越新，而对个别农民买卖土地，互助组发生涣散现象的原因认识不清，现在才知道这是小农经济盲目自发势力的表现。要克服这种盲目自发势力，只有领导农民走互助合作的道路，加强对他们的社会主义改造工作。另外，有些干部在认识了农业发展和工业发展的相互关系之后，踊跃地将自己家中的余粮卖给国家，当涂县就有二百五十多名干部在学习中，自动报名将家中的余粮卖给国家。
    目前，河南、安徽经过学习的各级干部，正向农民广泛进行国家过渡时期总路线的宣传和教育。河南省各个乡现正召开人民代表会议、农民代表大会和各种活动分子会议，进行总路线的传达和学习。这些会议结束后，向农民大张旗鼓的宣传运动，就将在全省农村中展开。安徽省参加学习的干部，现在也都回到了自己的工作岗位，开始向农民进行总路线的宣传教育。宿县西北乡的九个农业生产合作社和五十多个互助组在干部领导学习了总路线后，都表示要进一步巩固和发展互助合作组织，做好冬季生产工作。  （新华社）
