Farmers of Shiyan Village Sell More Than 80,000 Jin of Surplus Grain

    Farmers in Shiyan Village, Jiangjin County, Sichuan Province, have sold more than 83,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. The money from the grain sales has been used in a planned way, with half of it going to bank savings, cooperative memberships, and loan repayments. The remainder is used for buying cloth and increasing living supplies, or for buying pigs and fertilizer to increase production, so they can sell even more grain to the state next year.

    In the beginning, not all farmers in Shiyan Village were so eager to sell grain. When the grain purchasing team arrived in the village, many people pretended to be poor and complained. It turned out they each had their own plans. Many were scared of starvation from the old society, and now that they had surplus grain, they wanted to save it. They said, "If we don't buy or sell, the grain stays in the house, and we don't have to worry." They wouldn't sell grain unless they were forced to by pressing needs. If they had to sell, it would be a dou at a time, or a sheng at a time. A few people wanted to keep the grain to lend at high interest rates, using it as capital for speculation and exploitation. Some rich peasants not only refused to sell grain, but also took the opportunity to buy some and hoard it.

    Regardless of individual plans, the main reason some farmers were unwilling to sell grain was that they did not understand the significance of the state's grain purchases. Therefore, the comrades of the grain purchasing team patiently explained it to them. When they spoke of the many benefits the people's government had brought to the farmers over the years, many people nodded repeatedly and said, "Honestly, we only have grain to sell since Chairman Mao came!" When they talked about what the state would do with the purchased grain, many people suddenly realized, "It turns out we were only thinking about our own small interests, but we didn't know about the state's big plans. If we keep the grain and don't sell it, we'll delay the country's industrial construction, and the good days of machine farming won't come!" Everyone happily sold their grain. Zhou Dehui sold all of his 1,500 jin of surplus grain to the state and also mobilized others, saying, "Since the Communist Party came, they have eliminated bandits, suppressed local tyrants, and implemented land reform. Every policy is beneficial to the farmers. They also help us with production, providing livestock loans and farm implement loans. They even give loans when we run out of grain in the spring. Our village alone borrowed more than six million! When cows and pigs get sick, they send people to give injections and treatment. These are things we can use and eat, things everyone knows and sees. Now that we have harvested more grain, the government buys it with money to build the country and improve our lives. How can we say we shouldn't sell!" Everyone also criticized the speculative and profiteering ideas of some people: "You hoard grain and don't sell it, wanting to lend it at high interest rates, sell it at high prices, and exploit others, wanting to take the old capitalist road. The state won't allow it, and neither will we, the broad masses of farmers!"

    Many farmers were willing to sell grain, but they didn't know how much to sell. They only knew that this year's harvest was increased, and the grain was piled up. They didn't have a comprehensive plan for how to eat it or use it. Some people would eat and sell throughout the year, and if they ran out in the end, they would buy more. Therefore, the comrades of the grain purchasing team helped them to carefully calculate and make plans. They made consumption plans and production plans. Lu Zuyun was very satisfied after making a plan. He said, "After calculating it this way and making a plan, I know how much grain to eat, how much to use, how to save, and how to increase production. Next year, after harvesting the grain, I can sell the surplus grain to the state right away."

    With the continuous publicity, education, and specific assistance of the grain purchasing team, one family sold a thousand jin, another family sold five hundred jin, and the whole village sold their surplus grain. (Lin Mo)

    石堰村农民卖出了八万多斤余粮
    四川省江津县石堰村农民把多余的粮食八万三千多斤卖给国家了。卖粮的钱都有计划地作了正用，有一半用在存银行、入合作社、还贷款，其余的，或扯布疋，增添生活资料，或买猪、买肥料，增加生产，好在明年能把更多的粮食卖给国家。
    在开头，石堰村并不是所有的农民都这样踊跃卖粮的。购粮组来到村子，很多人就装穷诉苦。原来他们各有各的打算。很多人是在旧社会饿怕了，现在有了余粮总想保存起来。他们说：“不买不卖，粮食放在屋里，望到心里不忧愁。”他们非到用项逼到头上不卖粮，要卖也是用一斗，卖一斗，用一升，卖一升。有少数人是想把粮食留着放高利贷，当作投机发财、剥削别人的资本，有个别的富农不但不卖粮食，还趁机买些粮食囤积起来。
    不管各人打算如何，有些农民不肯卖粮，主要是因为他们不懂得国家购粮的意义。因此，购粮组的同志就耐心地向他们宣传。当讲到历年人民政府带给农民的许多好处的时候，好些人连连点头说：“凭良心讲，只有毛主席来了，我们才有得粮食卖啊！”当讲到国家把粮食买去干什么的时候，好些人恍然大悟：“原来咱光打自家的小算盘，却不晓得国家的大算盘，咱们放着粮食不卖，耽误了国家的工业建设，机器耕田的好日子来不了呀！”大家就高高兴兴地卖出粮食了。周德辉把一千五百斤余粮全部卖给国家，还到处动员别人：“共产党来了，就剿土匪，反恶霸，实行土地改革，样样政策对农民有利。还帮助咱们闹生产，放牲畜贷款、农具贷款，春天没粮吃了也贷款，光咱一村就贷了六百多万；牛病了，猪病了，都派人来打针医治。这是用到手、吃到口，人人都晓得、都看见的。如今咱们多打了粮食，政府拿钱收买，用来建设国家，让我们生活更好，还能说不卖！”大家还对某些人的投机发财思想进行批评：“你们囤粮不卖，想放高利贷，卖大价剥削人，要走资本主义的老路，国家不允许，咱们农民大众也不答应啊！”
    有不少农民很愿意卖粮，可是不晓得该卖多少。他们只晓得今年增了产，粮食堆起；该怎么吃，怎么用，没有个通盘的计划。有些人是一年到头连吃带卖，最后吃不完了，就算有剩余，不够吃了就再买。因此，购粮组的同志就帮他们算细账、订计划。订了消费计划，还订生产计划。吕祖云订了计划后，十分满意。他说：“这么一算，订出个计划，粮食该吃多少，用多少，怎么节约，怎么增产，我就晓得了。明年打下粮食，多余的粮食，一下就可卖给国家了。”
    就在购粮组不断的宣传教育和具体帮助之下，这家一千，那家五百，全村都把余粮卖出来了。   （林沫）
