    Harbin Health School Begins to Streamline Institutions

    A letter from the Harbin Health School of the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government: After seeing the letter from reader Wei Li, published in the People's Daily on October 17th, criticizing our school for having too many faculty and staff, we conducted several inspections. Everyone agreed that the reader's criticism was correct. In the past, our school did not seriously and realistically review the staffing quotas, and the leadership did not allocate cadres well according to actual needs. When subordinates cried out for more personnel, we blindly added them, thus creating a situation of excessive personnel and a backlog of cadres. Now, with the specific assistance and guidance of the Health Bureau of the Central Ministry of Railways, we have conducted inspections. Based on the tasks that have been determined, we have proposed new staffing levels in accordance with central regulations, and comprehensively dealt with redundant personnel, streamlining a total of 112 people. In addition, we have also begun to rectify labor discipline and study discipline, revise this semester's work plan, and conduct in-depth inspections and summaries of teaching work in order to improve teaching effectiveness.

    哈尔滨卫生学校开始精简机构
    中央人民政府铁道部哈尔滨卫生学校来信：看到十月十七日人民日报所刊读者维里批评我校教职人员过多的来信之后，我们就进行了多次检查。大家一致认为读者的批评是正确的。我校过去没有认真地、实事求是地审查定员，领导方面没有很好根据实际需要来配备干部，在下面喊人员不够时就给盲目增添，因此造成了人员过多、干部积压的现象。现在，我们在中央铁道部卫生局的具体帮助和指导下进行了检查，根据已确定的任务按中央规定提出了新的定员，全面处理冗员，计编出人员一百一十二名。此外，我们还开始整顿劳动纪律和学习纪律，重新修订这一学期的工作计划，深入检查和总结教学工作，以提高教学效果。
