    Build Farmland Water Conservancy, Prepare for Next Year's Production
    Teach Water Conservancy Technology to the Masses
    In Meixian County, Guangdong, over 130 farmers have gained a preliminary understanding of water conservancy technology during this year's construction of farmland water conservancy projects. Upon returning to their villages, they went to work guiding farmland water conservancy efforts. Cai Ende, a farmer from Shaping Village, after learning the techniques, guided the repair of a six-li-long irrigation canal (which had been unsuccessfully repaired nine times in the past), saving 7 million yuan in repair costs. Under his influence and guidance, the village subsequently repaired five large and small mountain ponds and thirty irrigation canals, ensuring sufficient water for over 200 mu of paddy fields and converting over 100 mu of dry land into paddy fields. According to a survey in Meixian County, most of the 1,075 farmland water conservancy projects built under the guidance of these farmers meet the required standards. In addition, among the 131 projects built in the fourth and fifth districts of Luoding County under the guidance of trained farmers, 64 had complete facilities, were leak-proof, and could effectively serve their purpose; 61 had some leakage but the problem was minor and they could still effectively serve their purpose; and only 6 could not store water for irrigation. To strengthen technical guidance in farmland water conservancy work this winter and next spring and to ensure project quality, the Guangdong Provincial People's Government is currently conducting extensive water conservancy technology training for farmers in the thirteen counties of Wuhua, Maoming, Boluo, Yingde, Jieyang, Haifeng, Huiyang, Qujiang, Luoding, Yunfu, Lianjiang, Yangjiang, and Taishan, in conjunction with the construction of demonstration projects.

    Utilize Slack Season to Eliminate Water Calamities
    The People's Government of Fushan County, Shandong Province, seized the slack farming season to lead farmers in dredging the Shiligou River and renovating its tributaries. The project is 35 li long, and more than 7,000 farmers participated in the renovation, completing over 200,000 cubic meters of earthwork. It officially started on November 13th and was basically completed by the end of the month. Nearly 100,000 mu of farmland along the river in the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth districts of Fushan County are flooded every year during the flood season and rainy season, with nearly 50,000 mu yielding no harvest at all in summer and autumn, and the remaining 50,000 mu experiencing yield reductions of over 50 percent each year. After the completion of this project, the land in this area can basically eliminate water calamities, ensuring two harvests of wheat and autumn crops. It is estimated that grain production can be increased by more than 20 million jin per year. (Zhang Guangwen, et al.)
    Supporting Farmers in Water Conservancy Economically
    The Minhou Special District of Fujian Province has tentatively planned to build more than 2,500 various farmland water conservancy projects this winter and next spring, benefiting more than 240,000 mu of farmland. In addition, there are three key projects: the Qu'an Dam in Fuqing, the Baitai Canal in Minqing, and the Changzhi Canal in Luoyuan. According to this task, the Minhou Special Commissioner's Office has organized the engineering teams dispatched by the Central Ministry of Water Conservancy and the Provincial Bureau of Water Conservancy and the water conservancy technicians of the Special Commissioner's Office into three groups, which will tour various counties to provide guidance and assist in the construction of key projects. The Minhou Central Branch of the People's Bank of China will issue 3 billion yuan in water conservancy loans, and the provincial government will allocate 1.47 billion yuan in subsidies, enabling the construction of key projects and projects that the masses are unable to undertake. At present, the Changzhi Canal has started construction, while the Baitai Canal and Qu'an Dam are being designed. More than 40 small-scale water conservancy projects have been completed in the ninth and tenth districts of Minhou, and construction has also begun in other counties.
    In addition, in order to further consolidate and enhance the benefits of the Minjiang River's downstream flood control dike, the Fujian Provincial People's Government has decided to allocate more than 5 billion yuan to build six more sluice gates on the flood control dike, so that the more than 56,000 mu of land within the dike can not only be relieved of the threat of floods, but also avoid waterlogging disasters. This project started in full swing in early December and will strive to be completed by the end of March next year.

    Four Major Irrigation Projects Newly Built in Anhui
    Basically Completed
    The Anhui Provincial People's Government has newly built four large-scale irrigation projects in the Jiangnan and Huainan areas: the Baishan Canal between Nanling and Jingxian, the Qimen Weir in Shucheng, the Tonggong Dam in Xuancheng, and the Xiangshui Dam in Dingyuan. Among them, the Baishan Canal and the Xiangshui Dam are completely new projects, while the Tonggong Dam and the Qimen Weir are renovated using existing incomplete ditches, and necessary buildings have been added. The four projects have borrowed a total of more than 23 billion yuan. These projects started successively from the spring of 1951, and to date, except for a small part of the Qimen Weir that has not been completed, the rest have been completed. A total of more than 100 kilometers of main and branch canals have been excavated, and 298 new culverts and other construction projects have been built. The Baishan Canal released water for irrigation during the "May 1st" holiday this year, and the average yield per mu of land during the autumn harvest was more than 400 jin. During spring planting in the Xiangshui Dam irrigation area, it did not rain for 50 days, and the 750 mu of paddy fields were completely sown and nursed with water from the dam. The yield per mu of rice paddies in the Tonggong Dam and Qimen Weir irrigation areas has also increased by 200 to 300 jin compared to the past. The four projects have irrigated a total of more than 370,000 mu of paddy fields.
    Build More Canals to Expand Irrigation Area
    The Fangxiang Canal in Yangjia Township, Wenxiang County, Henan Province, was controlled by landlords in the township before liberation, and it was difficult for farmers to use water for irrigation. After liberation, in order to enable farmers to harvest more grain, the People's Government issued 42 million yuan in water conservancy loans and led farmers to open new canals and repair old canals. A total of five major branch canals, the Southmost Branch, South Branch, Central Branch, Northmost Branch, and North Branch, totaling 28 li in length and capable of irrigating more than 3,400 mu of land, were opened and repaired. As a result, the land near the Fangxiang Canal that can be irrigated has generally increased in yield. It is understood that land that used to produce 300 jin of grain per mu each year can now produce 500 jin. Seeing the fact that building water conservancy can produce more grain, farmers began repairing canals throughout the township after the winter wheat sowing was completed this year. The masses of five villages, Yangjia, Lijia, and Yijia, have repaired the three major gaps in the Southmost Branch Canal, dredged the silt at the bottom of the canal, and raised the northern embankment of the canal by three feet. Xiboutou Village raised both sides of the canal by five feet, allowing mountain water to flow into the east and west canals along the north canal. In order to ensure that irrigation and flood control do not interfere with each other, they not only widened and deepened the original east and west canals for drainage, but also dug a new canal that can irrigate more than 50 mu of land. More than 50 mu of autumn seedlings east of Xiazhuang Village were flooded by mountain floods and yielded nothing, and more than 30 mu of corn and cotton were reduced by 30% due to drought. Everyone found the cause of the disaster was the failure to repair the canals properly, so the whole village also repaired a canal. Now, the farmers throughout the township are renovating the Northmost Branch Canal and the Southmost Branch Canal, striving to expand the irrigated area by another 1,500 mu on the original basis.
    Repair Weirs and Ditches to Fill Winter Water Fields and Pond Fields
    In Wuxian Township, Yingjing County, Xikang Province, during the months of August and September when there was more rainfall, many winter water fields and pond fields (fields that can both store water and transplant seedlings) in various villages were filled with water. At that time, many farmers thought that there would be no problem with the winter water this year, so they did not pay attention to repairing the collapsed and silted weirs and ditches, and the water-soaked and leaking fields. By October, when there was little rainfall, the fields that were originally full of water dried up, and there was no water in the two township weirs. At this time, everyone became anxious and felt that repairing weirs and ditches and plugging leaks in field embankments was still the solution. After the village cadres studied the matter, they mobilized more than 70 beneficiary households in mid-October to repair the Xinhang and Entao weirs, plug the leaks in the field embankments, and divert the weir water to fill the winter water fields and pond fields.

    兴修农田水利，准备明年生产
    把水利技术教给群众
    广东梅县在今年兴修农田水利中，使一百三十多个农民初步学得水利技术。他们回到村里便分头进行农田水利的指导工作。沙坪村农民蔡恩德学习后，指导修补好了一条六里长的水圳（过去曾经修补九次未修好），并节省修补工程费七百万元。在他的影响和指导下，该村接着又修好了大小山塘五口，水圳三十条，使二百多亩水田有充足的用水，一百多亩旱地也变成了水田。据梅县调查，由这批农民指导兴建的一千零七十五宗农田水利工程，大部分都合乎标准。另外，罗定县四、五两区由受训练农民指导兴修的一百三十一宗工程中，设备健全、不漏水、能发挥工程效益的有六十四宗，有些漏水但问题不大，仍可发挥工程效益的有六十一宗，不能蓄水灌溉的只有六宗。为了加强今冬明春农田水利工作中的技术指导，保证工程质量，广东省人民政府现正在五华、茂名、博罗、英德、揭阳、海丰、惠阳、曲江、罗定、云浮、廉江、阳江、台山十三县，结合示范工程的施工，广泛对农民进行水利技术的训练。（徐衍绶）
    利用农闲消除水患
    山东凫山县人民政府抓紧农闲季节，领导农民导治石里沟河，并整修其支流。这一工程全长三十五华里，参加整修的农民七千多人，共做二十多万土方，从十一月十三日正式开工，到月底已基本完成。凫山县三、四、五、六等区沿河地带将近十万亩农田每年汛期和雨季都是一片汪洋，其中约有将近五万亩地夏秋两季全无收获，其余五万亩每年也减产在百分之五十以上。此项工程完成后，这一带土地基本上可以消除水患，保证麦秋两熟。估计每年可增产粮食二千多万斤。（张广文等）
    从经济上支持农民修水利
    福建省闽侯专区初步计划在今冬明春兴修各种农田水利工程二千五百多处，受益农田可达二十四万多亩。另外，还有重点工程三处——福清曲安坝、闽清白台渠、罗源长治渠。根据这一任务，闽侯专署已将中央水利部、省水利局派去的工程队与专署的水利技术人员组织成三个组，分别往各县巡回指导，协助进行重点工程的兴建。人民银行闽侯中心支行将发放水利贷款三十亿元，省府拨补助经费十四亿七千万元，使重点工程及群众无力兴修的工程得以兴建。目前，长治渠已开始动工，白台渠、曲安坝正在设计，闽侯九、十两区已修好小型水利四十多处，其他各县也都开始兴修。
    此外，为了进一步巩固和发挥闽江下游防洪堤的效益，福建省人民政府决定拨款五十多亿元在防洪堤上增建六座水闸，使堤内五万六千多亩田地既能解除洪水威胁，又可避免内涝成灾。这项工程在十二月初全面开工，争取明年三月底完工。

      安徽新修四大灌溉工程
        基本竣工
    安徽省人民政府在江南、淮南地区新修了四处规模较大的灌溉工程——南陵、泾县之间的柏山渠，舒城的七门堰，宣城的佟公坝和定远的响水坝。其中柏山渠、响水坝是全部新建工程，佟公坝、七门堰是利用旧有不完整的沟渠加以整修，并加建了必需的建筑物。四处工程共贷款二百三十多亿元。这些工程，从一九五一年春季起陆续开工，到目前止，除七门堰还有一小部分工程没有完成外，其余都已全部完工。总计开挖干支渠道一百余公里，新建涵闸等建筑工程二百九十八座。柏山渠在今年“五一”节放水灌溉，秋收时一般田每亩都收四百斤以上。响水坝灌溉区在春种时有五十天没下雨，七百五十亩泡秧田完全是靠坝水下种育秧的。佟公坝和七门堰两灌区稻田每亩产量也比过去多收二、三百斤。四处工程共灌溉了三十七万多亩水稻田。
    多修渠道扩大灌溉面积
    河南阌乡县杨家乡的方庠渠，解放前被该乡地主所掌握，农民很难用水浇地；解放后，人民政府为了使农民多收粮食，发放水利贷款四千二百万元，领导农民开新渠、修旧渠。计共开修了二十八华里长能浇地三千四百多亩的最南、南支、中央、最北、北支五条大支渠。由于这样，方庠渠附近能浇上水的土地普遍获得增产。据了解，过去每年每亩实产三百斤粮的地，现在能产五百斤。农民看到了兴修水利能多打粮食的事实，在今年冬小麦播种完毕后，全乡即转入了修渠工作。杨家、李家、宜家等五个村群众已把最南支渠的三个大缺口修复，挖出渠底淤泥，将该渠北堤加高三尺。西堡头村把渠两岸加高五尺，让山水顺着北渠流入东西渠。为使浇地和防洪互不影响，他们除把原来的东西渠挖宽加深，专门用作排水外，又挖了一条新渠，能灌田五十多亩。下庄村村东五十多亩秋苗被山洪淹没，颗粒无收，三十多亩玉米和棉花，又因天旱减产三成。大家找到了遭灾原因是没有修好渠道，于是全村便也修了一条渠道。现在，全乡农民正在整修最北支渠和最南支渠，争取在原有基础上，再扩大水地面积一千五百多亩。
    修补堰渠灌满冬水田和塘田
    西康省荥经县五宪乡在八、九月雨水较多的时候，各村很多冬水田和塘田（既能蓄水又能插秧的田）都灌满了水。当时有很多农民以为今年的冬水不成问题了，因而对垮塌、淤塞了的堰道和浸水漏水的田就没有注意修补。到了十月间雨水稀少的时候，原来灌满水的田就干了，乡里的两条水堰也没有水了，这时，大家才着急起来，觉得还是要修补堰渠、堵塞田坎漏洞才是办法。乡村干部研究后，便在十月中旬发动了七十多户受益人家，把新横、恩滔两条堰培修好，并补塞了田坎漏洞，又把堰水引来灌满了冬水田和塘田。
