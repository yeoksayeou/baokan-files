Xinhua News Agency, New York, 2nd Dispatch from TASS: The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary session on the afternoon of November 30th to begin discussing the so-called "atrocities" problem committed by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army against "United Nations Forces" prisoners of war, a matter proposed by the U.S. delegation.

    The U.S. representative repeated the slanderous assertions found in the U.S. Army Department's report on the alleged "atrocities" committed by the Korean and Chinese forces. Lodge's speech was filled, from beginning to end, with hostile attacks against the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Finally, on behalf of the U.S., British, Australian, Turkish, and French delegations, he put forward a proposal recommending that the General Assembly "express grave concern" regarding the "reports and information" related to the so-called atrocities and "condemn any government or authority" for the various "atrocities" committed against "captured military personnel or civilians." Representatives from Britain, Turkey, and Canada spoke after Lodge, urging the representatives of all countries to support this proposal.

    Polish representative Naszkowski spoke. He proved that the U.S. delegation’s forcing the General Assembly to discuss the “atrocities” issue was an attempt to further intensify the international situation and poison the international atmosphere. He asked the representatives of all countries to note that the U.S.'s launching another round of slanderous propaganda on the "atrocities" issue was clearly to find new excuses to obstruct the convening of the Korean political conference, or even to prevent the conference from being held at all. He quoted the original text of the U.S. Army Department's report to prove the absurd nature of the statements and "testimonies" in the report.

    The Polish representative emphasized that no matter what tricks the U.S. aggressors use to divert world public attention from the undeniable facts of the cruel atrocities committed by the U.S. military in Korea against peaceful residents and Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, they will not succeed. The propaganda conducted by the United States, which is hostile to the Korean and Chinese people, has backfired on the provocateurs themselves. Because they bear too great a responsibility for the suffering and sacrifice of the heroic Korean people. Naszkowski said that for the sake of peaceful cooperation, the United Nations must condemn the U.S. delegation's insane fabrication and slander against the Korean and Chinese people. The United Nations General Assembly must repel the U.S.'s trick to turn the United Nations into a propaganda agency of the U.S. State Department. The United Nations should not intensify the international situation, but should promote peace and peaceful cooperation between countries. The Polish delegation firmly opposed the slanderous proposal put forward by the U.S. delegation.

    联大开始讨论美国诬蔑朝中部队的所谓“暴行”问题
    波兰代表痛斥美国的诽谤宣传
    【新华社二日讯】塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会于十一月三十日下午举行全体会议，开始讨论美国代表团提出的所谓朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军对“联合国军”战俘施行“暴行”的问题。
    美国代表重复了美国陆军部关于所谓朝中部队施行“暴行”的报告中的诽谤谰言。洛奇的发言从头到尾都是对苏联、中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的敌意的攻击。最后，他代表美国代表团及英国、澳大利亚、土耳其、法国代表团提出一个提案，建议大会对于有关所谓暴行的 “报告与情报表示严重关注”，并“谴责任何政府或当局”对“被俘军事人员或平民进行的”种种
  “暴行”。英国、土耳其、加拿大代表继洛奇后发言，要求各国代表支持这一提案。
    波兰代表纳斯科夫斯基发言。他证明：美国代表团强使大会讨论“暴行”问题，是要想这样来使国际局势更加紧张，并毒化国际气氛。他请各国代表注意：美国所以要在“暴行”问题上又来一次诽谤宣传，显然是为了寻找新的藉口，来阻挠朝鲜政治会议的召开，甚至使这个会议开不成。他引用美国陆军部报告的原文，就证明了这个报告中的说法与“证词”的荒谬性质。
    波兰代表着重指出，美国侵略者无论用什么诡计，想来转移世界公众对于朝鲜美国军方对和平居民和朝中战俘施行残酷暴行这一不容置辩的事实的注意，都是不会成功的。美国进行的敌视朝中人民的宣传，正反过来打了挑衅者自己。因为，他们对英勇的朝鲜人民的苦难和牺牲所应负的责任是太大了。纳斯科夫斯基说，为了和平合作，联合国必须谴责美国代表团疯狂捏造的对朝中人民的诬蔑。联合国大会必须打退美国想把联合国变成美国国务院的宣传机构的诡计。联合国不应使国际局势更加紧张，而应该促进和平与各国之间的和平合作。波兰代表团坚决反对美国代表团提出的诽谤性提案。
