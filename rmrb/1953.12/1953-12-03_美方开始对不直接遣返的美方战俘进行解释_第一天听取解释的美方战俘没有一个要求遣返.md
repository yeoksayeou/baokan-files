Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 2nd – After lengthy planning and arrangements, the U.S. side began explanations on the 2nd to U.S. POWs in the Songgok-ri POW camp who are not directly repatriated. Among the thirty South Korean POWs to whom the U.S. side gave explanations on the first day, not one requested repatriation.

Today’s explanation situation in Songgok-ri forms a stark contrast with the obstruction and sabotage by U.S. special agents of the explanation work of the Korean and Chinese side in the Tongjang-ri POW camp. There was no clamoring, cursing, beating, or violence; no fear or nervous tension under the threat of special agents. The thirty neatly dressed, cheerful, and healthy South Korean POWs demonstrated calmness and dignity during the explanation process. All POWs carried their luggage with them while listening to the explanations so that they could be placed in segregated custody after the explanations.

The explanations were conducted simultaneously in five tents, all of which were tall, bright, and equipped with heating. The tents were constructed of wooden boards joined together and were soundproofed from each other. The Korean and Chinese side also built isolation tents and installed heating equipment inside. The reasonable arrangement of the explanation venues demonstrates the sincerity of the Korean and Chinese side in consistently adhering to the “Terms of Reference” and the “Working Procedures.”

At 9:00 AM, the POWs arrived at the explanation venues on time. The first POW began listening to explanations at 9:05 AM. Forty-nine days prior, when the Korean and Chinese side first began giving explanations to our POWs in the Tongjang-ri POW camp, the explanations, originally scheduled to begin at 8:00 AM, were delayed until 4:25 PM because the U.S. side directed special agents to prevent the POWs from listening to the explanations.

After the explanation work began, the Rhee Syngman clique's explanation personnel attempted to "persuade" the POWs to return to South Korea using the following methods: 1. Reading aloud the enticing "proclamation" of the Rhee bandit Defense Minister, which included "retroactive payment of salaries," regular "promotions," praise for "meritorious service," no investigation of "wrongdoings" after being captured, and "priority" in finding employment and entering school according to the POW's wishes and abilities. 2. Distributing printed "proclamations" to the POWs and letting them browse propaganda photos. 3. Each explanation tent had a tape recorder playing records and "speeches" of already-repatriated POWs, "live" recordings of their meetings with family members, etc.

The POWs treated this entire set of deceptive tricks by the Rhee Syngman clique's explanation personnel with great patience and firm attitude. The POWs gave the Rhee Syngman personnel a stern and sharp rebuttal, but did not take any violent actions to interfere with the explanations. They even tried to control themselves in the face of extreme grief and indignation. In explanation tent number two, the first POW to listen to the explanations was a female POW. After listening to the words of the Rhee Syngman explanation personnel, she calmly told him: "I have already made my choice. It was my own choice. It is the path of truth. I have decided to stay. This is neither the Republic forcing me to do so, nor is it something you can shake." But the explanation personnel still pestered her, asking: "Your parents are waiting for you. Don't you miss them?" The female POW said: "My parents are long dead! They were killed by bombs dropped by American planes!" Unforgettable grief brought tears to her eyes, but she still maintained her dignity. After one explanation personnel from the Rhee Syngman side talked at length about the “freedom” of South Korea and played recordings for an hour and a half, another POW calmly asked: “Are you done with this set of boring tricks? No matter how long you keep doing this, I will never return to the enslavement and domination of South Korea.”

The POWs' constant, righteous questions to the Rhee Syngman personnel left them speechless and very embarrassed. In explanation tent number one, one POW asked: "Who started the war? Who dragged me out to be a soldier?" In tent number two, one POW asked: "When I was in the Rhee Syngman puppet army, American soldiers ordered me to stand guard while they raped Korean women. You tell me, is that the free world you are talking about?" In the face of these questions, the Rhee Syngman personnel could only stammer and evade.

Today’s explanation work in Songgok-ri proceeded completely according to the U.S. side's plan and was not interrupted by any accidents. There was only one representative from the Korean and Chinese side in each tent. They fully complied with the provisions of the "Working Procedures" and "Terms of Reference," quietly observing, and only offering their own opinions after a POW had finished listening to the explanations.

Many POWs said while listening to the explanations today: "The Korean and Chinese side has repeatedly advised us to go home, and we ourselves decided to stay after careful consideration."

### 美方开始对不直接遣返的美方战俘进行解释  第一天听取解释的美方战俘没有一个要求遣返

    美方开始对不直接遣返的美方战俘进行解释
    第一天听取解释的美方战俘没有一个要求遣返
    【新华社开城二日电】经过长期的策划和布置之后，美方于二日开始对松谷里战俘营中不直接遣返的美方战俘进行解释。在美方第一天对之进行解释的全体三十名南朝鲜战俘中间，没有一个人要求遣返。
    今天松谷里的解释情况与东场里战俘营中美方特务对朝中方面解释工作的阻挠与破坏形成鲜明的对比。没有鼓噪、谩骂、殴打和行凶，没有特务威胁下的恐惧和神经紧张，三十名服装整洁，精神愉快而健康的南朝鲜战俘在解释过程中表现了平静和尊严。所有战俘在听取解释时都随身携带了行李，以便在解释过后可以隔离看管。
    解释在五个帐篷中同时进行，这些帐篷都高大、明亮，安装了取暖设备，帐篷由木板镶接搭成，帐篷间互不传音。朝中方面并修盖了隔离帐篷，也在里边装置了取暖设备。对于解释场所的合理安排表明朝中方面一贯遵守“职权范围”和“工作细则”的诚意。
    上午九点钟，战俘们准时到达解释场所。第一个战俘在九点零五分听取解释。而在四十九天以前，当朝中方面第一次向东场里战俘营中的我方战俘进行解释时，由于美方指使特务阻止战俘听解释，使原定在上午八时开始的解释一直拖到下午四时二十五分才进行。
    在解释工作开始后，李承晚集团的解释人员用下述的方法企图“说服”战俘回到南朝鲜去：一、宣读李匪国防部长诱惑性的“文告”，内容包括“补发薪金”，按期“升级”，表扬“功劳”，不追究被俘后的“过错”以及依照战俘的愿望及能力给予寻找职业的“优先权”及入学等。二、发给战俘印好的“文告”，让战俘翻阅宣传照片。三、每一个解释帐篷有一个录音机，播送唱片和已经遣返的战俘的“讲话”、他们和家人见面时的“实况”等等。
    战俘们用极大的忍耐和坚定的态度来对待李承晚集团解释人员这一整套的诱骗伎俩。战俘们对这些李承晚人员进行了严正和尖锐的驳斥，但是没有采取任何干扰解释的暴力行动。他们甚至在极度悲愤的情况下也竭力控制住自己。在第二号解释帐篷，第一个听解释的是一个女战俘，当他听过李承晚解释人员的话以后，就安静地告诉他：“我早就选择好了，是我自己选择的，那是真理之路。我决定留下来，这既不是共和国强迫我这样作，也不是你们所能动摇的。”但那解释人员还缠着问她：“你的父母在盼望着你，你不想他们吗？”这个女战俘说：“我的父母早死了！他们就是美国飞机扔的炸弹炸死的！”难忘的悲痛使她的眼里噙着泪水，但她仍然保持着自己的尊严。另一名战俘在李承晚人员大说其南朝鲜的“自由”和放送录音，忙了一个半钟头之后，平静地反问道：“你这一套无聊花样完了没有？不管你继续搞多久，我是决不回到南朝鲜的奴役统治下的。”
    战俘们对李承晚人员不断提出的正义的质问，使这些人员弄得张口结舌十分狼狈。在第一号解释帐篷，一个战俘问道：“是谁发动战争的？是谁把我抓出来当兵的？”在第二号帐篷，一个战俘问道：“我在李承晚伪军里，美国兵强奸朝鲜妇女时竟叫我替他们站岗，你说，这就是你所说的自由世界吗？”在这些质问面前，李承晚人员只能支吾其词。
    今天松谷里的解释工作完全按照美方的计划进行，没有因任何事故而中断。每个帐篷中仅有一名朝中方面的代表，他们完全遵照“工作细则”和
  “职权范围”的规定，安静地进行观察，直至一个战俘听完解释之后才提出自己的意见。
    在今天战俘听取解释时，有很多战俘都说：
  “朝中方面早就多次劝说我们回家，我们自己经过郑重考虑才决定留下来。”3456789
