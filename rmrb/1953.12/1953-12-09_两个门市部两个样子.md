    Two Department Stores, Two Different Styles
    Liu Fazhong Luan Xueyan
    On a bustling street in Handan city, there's a second branch of a department store and a first branch of a consumer cooperative. Although these two stores are on the same street, their business operations are quite different. Although the cooperative's branch has fewer varieties and a smaller storefront, it has more customers, and people are more willing to buy goods at the cooperative. The department store's second branch, although it has a grand display, many people, and many goods, does not attract as many customers as the cooperative.

    What's the problem? Let's first lay out the actual situation of the two stores:

    The second branch of the department store has a total of twenty-two employees, including two directors, one accountant, one cashier, one security guard, and the rest are salespersons in various groups. They handle 920 kinds of goods. Their sales volume in the third quarter was 770 million yuan, with an average daily sales volume of over 380,000 yuan per person. Their daily business hours are ten hours, from 9:00 am to 7:00 pm.

    The first branch of the cooperative has only six employees, handling 420 kinds of goods. The sales volume in the third quarter was 650 million yuan, with an average daily sales volume of over 1.11 million yuan per person. In terms of labor efficiency, it is more than twice as high as the department store's second branch. This cooperative branch with six people implemented a joint work shift system a long time ago, with no rest on Sundays, and one person rotating for rest each day. According to the local business rules, they take a two-hour break at noon and extend business hours to 8:30 pm.

    But these are not the main reasons. So, what is the main reason?

    Customers are willing to buy goods at the cooperative's first branch mainly because the salespersons have a good service attitude towards customers, patiently serving and explaining. The cooperative's salesperson said: In the past, we often gave the members whatever they asked for. Now, we take the initiative to introduce the goods without being asked, trying our best to let them choose the goods without being afraid of trouble. Some members who come to buy things don't necessarily want to buy anything, but as long as we explain patiently and help them make up their minds, we can sell the goods. Therefore, this branch is often very crowded. The department store's second branch is not like this. When customers come to the store to buy goods, the salespersons do not greet them enthusiastically. When the customer says, "Comrade, show me a sweater," the salesperson silently puts the sweater on the counter. After the customer repeatedly picks and checks, and says, "Take another one to exchange," the salesperson says, "Is there anything wrong with it? If there is something wrong, I will exchange it for you. If there is nothing wrong, you have to take it." As a result, the customer left empty-handed without buying anything. Therefore, the masses reflect that buying goods at the department store is cheaper than private merchants, but you can't choose. If you ask to exchange goods twice at the department store, you don't dare to ask for another exchange, and you can't buy satisfactory goods. No wonder the cooperative store has only three rooms and fewer varieties of goods, but it is very crowded with customers. The department store has ten rooms, the windows are covered with awnings, there are many goods, but no one goes in, and it is very deserted.

    两个门市部两个样子
    刘法中  栾学彦
    邯郸城里一条热闹的街上，有一个百货商店的第二门市部，还有一个消费合作社第一门市部。这两个门市部虽然都在一条街上，可是经营的情况却并不一样。合作社的门市部虽然经营的品种不多，门面不大，但顾客多，大家愿意到合作社去买货；百货商店的第二门市部虽然排场挺大，人多货多，但是顾客到这里买货的不像到合作社买货的那样多。
    问题在那里呢？让我们先摆一下两个门市部的实际情况：
    百货商店第二门市部的工作人员共二十二人，其中有主任二人、会计、出纳、警卫各一人，其余是各组的营业员。他们经营着九百二十种商品；第三季度的销货额是七亿七千余万元，每人每日平均销货额是三十八万多元；每日营业时间十小时，从早九时到晚七时。
    合作社第一门市部的工作人员仅六个人，经营着四百二十种商品，第三季度销货额是六亿五千余万元，每人每日平均卖钱额一百一十一万多元，从劳动效率看，比百货商店第二门市部高二倍多。这个六个人的合作社门市部，很早以前就实行了连带上班制，星期天不休息，每天抽一人轮流休息；并根据当地经营的规律，中午休息两小时，晚上延长营业时间至八时半。
    但是这些都不是主要原因，那么，主要原因何在呢？
    顾客们愿意到合作社第一门市部去买货，主要是营业员对顾客的服务态度好，耐心招待、解释。合作社的营业员说：过去我们对社员常常是问啥给啥，现在我们不用问就主动介绍商品，尽量让他们挑选商品，不怕麻烦。来买东西的社员，有的不一定要买啥，只要我们耐心解释，替他拿主意，就能把货卖了。因此该门市部常常是挤不动。百货商店第二门市部却不是这样，顾客到门市部来买货，营业员不热情招待，等顾客说：“同志拿绒衣看看。”营业员一声不啃把绒衣放在柜台上，等顾客反覆挑检后说：“再拿一件换换”，营业员就说：“有毛病没有，有毛病和你换，没毛病你得要”，结果顾客没有买货空着手走了。所以群众反映：到百货公司买货比私商价钱便宜，可是不能挑选。到百货公司买货挑换两次就不敢再叫换了，买不到称心货。难怪合作社门市部只三间，商品品种少，但顾客很挤；百货公司门市部有十间，窗户盖着雨搭，商品不少，就是没人进去，很冷清。
