    Saluting the Heroic People of Pyongyang
    Lao She
    Please forgive me if this piece is not very long. I have just arrived in Pyongyang, and I cannot yet find the right words to express all the emotions I have felt. Being deeply moved often leaves one speechless, and that is how I feel now.
    As soon as I got off the train and saw the elders, brothers, sisters, and children welcoming us, tears welled up in my eyes. I wanted to embrace every friend, to kiss every one of those thousands of red flags! I want to shout: "Friends, every Chinese person wants to hold your hands, to offer you the warmest condolences, and to congratulate you on your great victory in resisting aggression and defending peace!"
    Yes, all the people of China respect the heroic people of Korea and think of you every moment; your happiness and suffering are also our happiness and suffering! All the people of China, even the little children in kindergarten, have not forgotten this glorious capital, Pyongyang, for a single day. Every time we hear that Pyongyang has suffered a bit of damage, we increase our hatred for the American imperialist aggressors. The more we love the Korean people, the more we hate the American aggressors!
    How beautiful Pyongyang is! I hate the American bandits who bombed such a beautiful city!
    However, Pyongyang has not lost its brilliance because of the bombing. Look, the old men, old women, young girls, and children are all smiling, carrying stones, moving bricks, transporting earth, building the houses everyone needs, working and singing at the same time. How optimistic this is! You did not cry when you suffered the bombing of the violent enemy; you are not slacking in healing the wounds of war, and you are not afraid of hardship. How tenacious this is! The faces and bodies of the old and young men and women carrying stones and earth are full of the heroic spirit of overcoming difficulties! Such hardworking and brave people will never fail! Friends, glory and victory belong to you!
    In a documentary film, I saw the great plan to rebuild Pyongyang. I firmly believe that the heroic people will be able to build a new Pyongyang according to the plan and live a peaceful and happy life again. The new Pyongyang will be the most beautiful capital, forever a jewel in the world, radiating the revolutionary glory of resolutely fighting for national independence and freedom!
    On the way to Pyongyang, I saw the Chinese People's Volunteers helping the Korean people repair roads and build new houses. In Pyongyang, I saw volunteer engineers helping the people of Pyongyang repair the iron bridge over the Daedong River. This proves that we fight together and build together; our blood flows in the same place, and our sweat also drips together. We are united as one. The close unity of the two nations of Korea and China is a huge force for defending world peace. We are not just repairing roads, building houses, and repairing bridges together; we are also working together with all peace-loving people to build a peaceful world!
    The Chinese people are now universally launching a campaign to continue to deepen the resistance against America and aid to Korea. After the armistice, just as in the war against aggression, the people of Korea and China stand together. The Chinese people will certainly use the most sincere friendship to help the Korean people heal the wounds of war and restore peaceful life. I will soon return to China, and I will convey the heroic deeds I have seen and heard in Pyongyang and other places to the Chinese people, especially your tenacious fighting spirit. The Chinese people all want to learn from you! Let us always help each other, learn from each other, encourage each other, care for each other, and be the closest friends for generations to come!
    Long live the great Pyongyang!
    Long live the heroic people of Pyongyang!

### 向英雄的平壤人民致敬

    向英雄的平壤人民致敬
    老舍
    请原谅我，这篇文字恐怕不会写得很长。我刚刚来到平壤，一时还找不到适当的语言，说出我所受的一切感动。受感动太深，往往说不出话来，我现在就是这样。
    一下火车，看到欢迎我们的父老兄弟姊妹，我的泪就夺眶而出。我恨不能去拥抱每一位朋友，去吻遍那千面百面红旗！我愿高呼：“朋友们，每一个中国人都愿来握着你们的手，向你们作最亲切的慰问，祝贺你们反抗侵略与保卫和平的伟大胜利！”
    是的，全中国的人民都敬爱英雄的朝鲜人民，无时无刻不在怀念着你们；你们的幸福与痛苦也就是我们的幸福与痛苦！全中国的人民，连幼儿园的小儿女，都没有一天忘记这光辉的都城——平壤。每当我们听说平壤遭受一分破坏，我们就增多一分对美帝国主义侵略者的憎恨。我们越爱朝鲜人民，就越憎恨美国侵略者！
    多么美丽的平壤啊！我痛恨那轰炸这么美丽的都市的美国强盗！
    可是，平壤并不因为轰炸而减少了光彩。看，老大爷、老大娘、年轻的姑娘、小孩们都面带笑容，扛石头，搬砖，运土，修建着大家需用的房屋，一边工作一边歌唱。这是多么乐观！在遭受暴敌轰炸的时候，你们没有哭；在医治战争创伤的时候，你们毫不懈怠，不怕吃苦。这是多么顽强！在那搬石运土的老幼男女的脸上身上都充满克服困难的英雄气概！这样勤劳勇敢的人民永远不会失败！朋友们，光荣与胜利属于你们！
    在一部纪录影片里，我看到重建平壤的伟大计划。我深信英雄的人民必能按照计划建设起新的平壤，重过和平幸福的生活。新的平壤将是一座最美丽的都城，永远是世界上的一颗宝珠，放射着为民族独立自由而坚决斗争的革命光芒！
    在到平壤的路上，我看见中国人民志愿军正帮助朝鲜人民修路，盖新房。在平壤，我看见志愿军工兵帮着平壤人民修补大同江上的铁桥。这证明：我们在一起战斗，也在一起建设；我们的血流在一处，我们的汗也滴在一起。我们结成了一条心。朝中两大民族的亲密团结是保卫世界和平的一支巨大力量。我们岂止在一起修路，盖房，修桥，我们也协力同心和一切爱好和平的人民一起建设起和平的世界！
    中国人民现在正普遍地展开继续深入抗美援朝的运动。在停战以后，正如在反抗侵略的战争中一样，朝中两国人民是站在一起的。中国人民必定以最诚挚的友情援助朝鲜人民医治战争的创伤，恢复和平生活。我不久就将回到中国去，我要把在平壤和其他地方所见所闻的英雄事迹，传达给中国人民，特别是你们的顽强的战斗精神。中国人民都愿向你们学习！就让我们永远互相帮助，互相学习，互相鼓舞，互相关切，世世代代都是最亲密的朋友！
    伟大的平壤万岁！
    英雄的平壤人民万岁！
