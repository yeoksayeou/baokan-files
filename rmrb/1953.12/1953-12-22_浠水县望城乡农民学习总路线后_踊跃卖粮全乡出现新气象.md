After studying the general line, the political consciousness of the farmers in Wangcheng Township, Xishui County, Hubei Province, has been universally raised, and a new atmosphere has emerged throughout the township. One farmer, after studying, said to the usurer: "You have usury, but I won't borrow from you. I have a credit cooperative. I won't look for you anymore!" Farmer Liu Renfu used to peddle cloth frequently. After studying, when others asked him to peddle cloth again, he refused, saying: "That is the old road, I will not do it anymore." Farmer Shi Boyou said after studying: "Even my own brothers are not as reliable as the Communist Party and the People's Government!" After the political consciousness of the farmers throughout the township was raised, their enthusiasm for selling grain was very high. They all rushed to deliver grain. Many farming households selling one or two thousand catties of grain helped each other to deliver all the grain in one day. The farmers throughout the township sold more than 280,000 catties of surplus grain to the state in five days.

After studying, the farmers' enthusiasm for production has been greatly improved, and they have all asked to organize production cooperatives. Mutual aid teams such as Chen Xueming, Shi Ruide, Wang Shanghua, and Rao Xingming in the township all plan to organize production cooperatives. The eleventh mutual aid team, consisting of forty farming households, requested to organize a production cooperative. Some individual farmers also requested to directly organize production cooperatives. Many farmers are also preparing to join supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives. Farmer Zhan Xianrong received more than 430,000 yuan from selling grain. He took 200,000 yuan to repay the government's agricultural implement loan, paid the shares to join the supply and marketing cooperative and the credit cooperative, bought some daily necessities, and deposited the remaining money in the bank, planning to buy a cow with others next year.

Now is the time for weeding wheat fields and collecting pond mud for fertilizer in rural Hubei. After selling grain to the state, the farmers in the township are actively engaged in these activities. (Xinhua News Agency)

    浠水县望城乡农民学习总路线后
    踊跃卖粮全乡出现新气象
    湖北省浠水县望城乡农民学习总路线后政治觉悟普遍提高，全乡出现了新气象。有一个农民经过学习后，向高利贷者说：“你有高利贷我不借，我有信用合作社。今后我不再找你了！”农民刘仁富过去经常贩布，经过学习后，别人再约他去贩布，他拒绝说：那是旧道路，我不再干了。农民施伯友经过学习后说：“连亲兄弟也没共产党和人民政府靠得住！”全乡农民政治觉悟提高后，卖粮的热情很高，他们都争先送粮，有很多卖一两千斤粮的农户，都和别人互相帮助把粮食一天送完。全乡农民在五天内把二十八万多斤余粮卖给了国家。
    经过学习后，农民们的生产积极性都大大提高了，纷纷要求组织生产合作社。该乡陈学明、石瑞德、汪尚华、饶兴明等互助组都打算组织生产合作社，第十一互助组四十户农民要求组织一个生产合作社。有些单干农户也要求直接组织生产合作社。许多农民并准备参加供销合作社和信用合作社。农民詹先荣卖谷得了四十三万多元，他拿了二十万元归还政府的农具贷款，并缴纳加入供销合作社和信用合作社的股金，另外买了些生活必需品，其余的钱就全部存入银行，准备明年与人合伙买牛。
    现在正是湖北农村锄麦田草和打塘泥积肥的时候，该乡农民把粮食卖给国家后，都积极投入这一活动。　　　　　　　　　　　（新华社）
