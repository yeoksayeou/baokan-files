CPC Hejian County Committee Secretary Cui Tao led a work team deep into the countryside, summarizing farmers' methods for saving grain and helping Dongshijing Village in the county formulate a grain-saving plan. The village, with 509 households, can save a total of 150,000 jin of grain annually.

After the work team arrived in the village and conducted a preliminary investigation, they discovered two different situations in the lives of the farmers: some farmers should have a surplus of grain based on their harvest calculations, but they ended up not having enough to eat; others should not have enough grain based on their harvest calculations, but they ended up having a surplus after having enough to eat. After studying the situation with village cadres, the work team found the key to these two opposing situations was whether or not farmers paid attention to proper storage and careful use of grain after the autumn harvest. For example, farmer Sun Tongqin left corn cobs in the yard for more than two months, where they were pecked at and spoiled by chickens and ducks, resulting in a loss of more than 20 jin. Liu Zhiwu's millet was eaten by rats, losing more than one dou. In contrast, Sun Baozhong collected a lot of dried vegetables every year, saving 100 to 200 jin of grain annually. Bai Yushi, Wang Tongyi, and others used yam vines and peanut roots as pig and cattle feed, saving 200 jin of feed grain annually. Based on these situations, the work team first educated all Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members in the village, helping them understand the significant importance of saving grain for supporting national construction and expanding production for the farmers themselves. Then, they mobilized Party members and League members to help all the farmers in the village to be careful and frugal and formulate grain-saving plans. According to calculations, the farmers in the village can save 150,000 jin of grain annually by strengthening grain storage, exchanging fine grains for coarse grains, and reducing the amount of grain used for feed.

After extensive publicity, education, and detailed accounting, all the farmers in the village have actively taken action. The whole village has already collected and dried more than 11,000 jin of dried vegetables, 62 families have exchanged more than 3,700 jin of wheat for coarse grains, 210 out of 250 cattle are using sesame cake instead of grain for feed, and many women are paying attention to saving grain when feeding chickens, grinding flour, and cooking.

    中共河间县委书记崔涛帮助农民找出节约粮食办法
    东诗经村农民计划全年节约粮食十五万斤
    中共河北省河间县委书记崔涛率领工作组深入农村，总结农民节约粮食的办法，帮助该县东诗经村订出节约粮食的计划，全村五百零九户，全年共可节约粮食十五万斤。
    工作组到达该村进行初步调查后，发现农民生活中有两种不同情况：有些农民所收粮食按计算应当有余，但结果却不够吃；另有些户所收粮食按计算不够用，但最后除够吃外还有余。工作组和村干部研究后，摸到了产生这两种相反情况的关键，是秋后能否注意保管和精打细算地使用粮食。如农民孙同琴把玉米棒子放在院子里两个多月，鸡刨鸭吃糟踏了二十多斤，刘志五的谷子被老鼠吃去一斗多；与以上相反，孙宝中每年采集很多干菜，每年节约粮食一、二百斤，白玉石、王桐义等用山药蔓、花生根作猪牛饲料，每年可节省饲料粮二百斤。工作组根据这些情况，首先向全村共产党员、青年团员进行教育，帮助他们认识节约粮食对支持国家建设和农民自己扩大生产的重大意义。接着便发动党员、团员帮助全村农民精打细算，制订节约粮食的计划。根据计算，全村农民从加强粮食保管、以细换粗和减少饲料用粮等方面，全年可节约十五万斤粮食。
    经过广泛的宣传教育和算细账以后，全村农民都已积极地行动起来。全村已采晒干菜一万一千多斤，已有六十二家把三千七百多斤小麦换成粗粮，二百五十头牛中已有二百一十头用麻饼代替粮食作饲料，很多妇女在喂鸡、推磨、做饭时都注意节约粮食。
