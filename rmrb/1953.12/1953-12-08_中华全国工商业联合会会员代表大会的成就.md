Achievements of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce Member Representatives Conference
    Chen Shutong

    The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce Member Representatives Conference successfully concluded on November 12th, after twenty-one days of enthusiastic and intense meetings. This was an unprecedented grand gathering for national industrialists and businessmen since the preparatory meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce last year, and also a conference of great significance for the unity and education of private industrialists and businessmen nationwide.

    The characteristics of this conference are:

    First, this conference was convened precisely when our great leader Chairman Mao instructed the people of the whole country on the general line and general task of the state during the transition period. The conference revolved around the general line and general task for discussion, clarified the future of private industry and commerce, and pointed out the direction of effort for private industrialists and businessmen. In particular, the speech by Li Weihan, Deputy Director of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, provided an in-depth and detailed exposition, indicating the path of socialist transformation for private industry and commerce.

    Second, all representatives were organized into delegations according to major administrative regions and the Tibet region, and overseas Chinese also formed a delegation. Representatives of state-owned enterprises and cooperatives also participated in the delegations. The leadership and organization were very strong, playing a great role in promoting the smooth progress of the meeting.

    Finally, this conference fully demonstrated the spirit of democratic unity and discussed issues with full freedom. Especially in various group discussions, the representatives, with a completely open and appropriately analytical approach, reached the point of knowing everything and saying everything, inspiring and helping each other, so that various problems could be clarified and also made specific.

    During the meeting, representatives from various regions and industries listened to reports at the conference, went through group discussions, and earnestly and deeply studied the opening speech of the conference and the instructions of Deputy Director Li. Generally, they improved their ideological understanding, enabling this conference to achieve the following major accomplishments:

    First, all representatives unanimously recognized the greatness and correctness of the general line and general task of the state during the transition period, expressed warm support, and revealed a joyful and excited mood toward the gradual realization of socialist industrialization in our great motherland. The representatives pledged to abide by the state's policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming private industry and commerce, and voluntarily and actively carry out socialist transformation.

    National industrialization is the desire of the Chinese people for a hundred years. Chairman Mao taught us: "Without industry, there will be no solid national defense, no people's welfare, and no national prosperity." Now our country, from the very beginning, is building industry on a grand scale, steadily transitioning from a backward agricultural country to an advanced socialist industrial country. This is something that all patriotic industrialists and businessmen cannot help but feel excited about.

    Through this conference, the representatives unanimously recognized that China's industrialization must absolutely not take the capitalist road. Capitalist industrialization is a way of exploiting the vast majority of people by a minority to ensure the maximum profit of the minority, resulting in the development of monopoly capital and embarking on the road of economic crisis, unemployment, poverty, war, and death. Only the socialist industrialization road taken by the Soviet socialist country can guarantee the complete independence of our country's economy and the definite security of national defense, as well as the continuous expansion of social production and the continuous improvement of people's lives.

    All representatives also recognized the dual nature of private industry and commerce. In order to adapt to national construction and gradually incorporate it into the state track, it is necessary to overcome the negative side of private capitalism and give play to its positive side, which is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Therefore, the representatives mostly said: Private industrialists and businessmen must: "Operate actively, strive for utilization; do not commit the 'five poisons,' accept restrictions; study earnestly, welcome transformation."

    This is the first major achievement of the conference.

    Second, all representatives unanimously recognized that the relatively sound principle and method for private industry and commerce to carry out socialist transformation is to gradually incorporate it into the track of state capitalism. Therefore, they unanimously expressed their willingness to develop actively in the direction of state capitalism according to the needs and possibilities of the state.

    After in-depth discussions, the representatives recognized that state capitalism is an economic alliance under the direct leadership of the socialist economy, in which socialist components and capitalist components are linked and cooperate. This kind of connection and cooperation is carried out in various forms and to varying degrees according to different conditions. In terms of type: state capitalism can be divided into the advanced form of joint state-private operation, the intermediate form of processing, ordering, unified purchase, and exclusive sales, and the low-level form of purchase and distribution. In the commercial field, state capitalism also has various forms such as joint state-private operation, agency purchase, agency sales, wholesale from state-owned enterprises and sales at prices stipulated by state-owned enterprises.

    Many representatives introduced the advantages of various forms of state capitalism, which general private capitalist enterprises do not have, based on their own experiences. Many representatives have clarified that private industry and commerce must first be content with legal operation, accept the management of the People's Government, the leadership of the state-owned economy, and the supervision of the masses of workers, create their own conditions, and strive to meet the needs and possibilities of the state. Both industry and commerce can move towards the track of state capitalism in a step-by-step and differentiated manner.

    This is the second major achievement of the conference.

    Third, the representatives unanimously recognized that socialist transformation is a long-term task. To do this work well, private industrialists and businessmen must combine enterprise transformation with personal transformation. As the resolution of this conference pointed out: Private industrialists and businessmen must first strengthen the transformation of their personal ideology and work style, and strengthen education on patriotism and law-abiding, and education on the state's policies of utilization, restriction, and transformation of private industry and commerce. Constantly and repeatedly launch criticism and self-criticism, and conduct serious criticism and struggle against all illegal acts. Only in this way can private industrialists and businessmen gradually improve their ideological understanding, correct their business style, see the long-term bright future of the motherland, and recognize the truth that individual interests and partial interests must be subordinate to national interests and the interests of the people.

    This is the third major achievement of the conference.

    Fourth, according to the instructions of Deputy Director Li Weihan, all representatives further clarified the important significance and specific direction of private industry and commerce in carrying out the increase production and practice economy movement. For national construction, the increase production and practice economy movement is a huge driving force for continuously improving production and completing or overfulfilling national plans; for private industry and commerce, the increase production and practice economy movement has a special significance for improving public-private relations and labor-capital relations, eliminating the 'five poisons,' and reforming the backward state of enterprises. The representatives unanimously pledged: In order to realize the glorious task of the first five-year plan, private industrialists and businessmen must, on the state's planned track and in accordance with the principle of supply, production, and sales balance, actively increase production and practice economy, improve business management, improve production technology, reduce product costs, improve product quality, and increase the production of inexpensive and high-quality goods to serve national construction and meet the needs of the broad masses of people.

    This is the fourth major achievement of the conference.

    Through this member representatives conference, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce was formally established. What kind of organization is the Federation of Industry and Commerce? It is an organization that leads industrialists and businessmen to abide by the Common Program and the policies and laws of the People's Government; it is an organization that represents the legitimate interests of various industrialists and businessmen, especially private industrialists and businessmen; and it is also a group for private industrialists and businessmen to unite, help each other, and carry out self-transformation. In the future, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce will unite and educate industrialists and businessmen across the country. And enable all trades, industries, large, medium and small households to get their place in the Federations of Industry and Commerce and trade associations at all levels, so as to cultivate backbones and lead the vast number of industrialists and businessmen to move forward together.

    After twenty-one days of meetings, although the discussion and learning were not entirely balanced, the representatives all felt that it was glorious and happy to be a patriotic and law-abiding private industrialist and businessman in the great Mao Zedong era. Private industry and commerce is an important economic factor in the country. Now there are legitimate profits to be made, and in the future, when peacefully entering a socialist society, there will be appropriate work to do. The representatives all believe that under the glorious light of the general line of the transition period, our private industrialists and businessmen can strengthen learning, get closer to the Communist Party and the People's Government, love the country and abide by the law, actively improve production, and be content with legal operation, and we will be able to successfully complete the socialist transformation. When we peacefully enter socialist society, we will share the happy life of socialist society together with the people of the whole country.

    I believe that through this conference, private industrialists and businessmen across the country will contribute even greater strength to the entire national economic construction.

    中华全国工商业联合会会员代表大会的成就
    陈叔通
    中华全国工商业联合会会员代表大会经过二十一天的热烈紧张的会议，已经在十一月十二日胜利闭幕了。这是全国工商业者继去年中华全国工商业联合会筹备代表会议后空前未有的盛会，也是对于全国私营工商业者的团结和教育，具有重大意义的一次大会。
    这次大会的特点是：
    首先，这次大会是正当我们伟大的领袖毛主席对全国人民指示了国家过渡时期的总路线和总任务的时候召开的。大会环绕着总路线和总任务进行讨论，明确了私营工商业的前途，指引了私营工商业者努力的方向。特别是政务院财政经济委员会李维汉副主任的讲话，作了深入而详尽地阐述，指示了私营工商业社会主义改造的道路。
    其次，全体代表按大行政区及西藏区分别组成代表团，国外华侨也组成了代表团，国营企业和合作社代表也参加了代表团，领导和组织都很坚强；对于会议顺利进行起了很大的推动作用。
    最后，这次大会充分地发挥了民主团结精神，充分自由地讨论问题，尤其在各种小组座谈当中，各代表以彻底敞开、适当分析的方法，做到了知无不言，言无不尽的地步，彼此启发帮助，使各种问题得以明确化，同时也具体化。
    会议期间，来自各地各行各业的代表们听了大会上的报告，经过了小组讨论，认真而深入地学习了大会开幕辞和李副主任的指示，一般地都提高了思想认识，使这次大会获得了下列几点重大的成就：
    第一、全体代表一致认识到国家过渡时期的总路线和总任务的伟大正确，表示热烈拥护，对于我们伟大的祖国逐步实现社会主义工业化，都流露了欢欣鼓舞的心情，代表们保证遵守国家对私营工商业所采取的利用、限制和改造的政策，自愿积极进行社会主义改造。
    国家工业化是我国人民百年来的愿望。毛主席教导我们说：“没有工业，便没有巩固的国防，便没有人民的福利，便没有国家的富强。”现在我们国家，一开始即以宏大的规模，来建设工业，稳步地由落后的农业国过渡到先进的社会主义工业国，这是所有的爱国工商业者莫不感到兴奋的。
    经过这次会议，代表们一致地认识到我国工业化绝对不能走资本主义的道路。资本主义工业化是以少数人剥削极大多数人的办法，来保证少数人的最大限度的利润，结果是发展成为垄断资本，走上经济危机、失业贫穷、战争和死亡的道路。只有苏联社会主义国家所走的社会主义工业化的道路，才能保障我国经济的完全独立和国防的确切安全，以及社会生产的不断扩大和人民生活的不断改善。
    全体代表也认识到了私营工商业的两面性。为了适应国家建设，逐步纳入国家轨道，必须克服私人资本主义消极的一面，而发挥其有利国计民生的积极一面。所以，代表们多说：私营工商业者必须：“积极经营，争取利用；不犯五毒，接受限制；认真学习，欢迎改造。”
    这是大会的第一个重大的成就。
    第二、全体代表一致认识到私营工商业进行社会主义改造，比较健全的方针和办法是逐步纳入国家资本主义的轨道。因此一致表示自愿根据国家的需要和可能，积极地向国家资本主义方向发展。
    经过了深入讨论，代表们认识到国家资本主义是在社会主义经济直接领导下的、社会主义成分与资本主义成分进行联系与合作的经济联盟。这种联系与合作是按照不同条件，采取各种形式，并且在不同程度上进行的。按类型来说：国家资本主义可以区分为高级形式的公私合营，中级形式的加工、订货、统购、包销和低级形式的收购、经销，在商业方面，国家资本主义也有公私合营、代购、代销、从国营企业批购并按国营企业规定价格出售等各种形式。
    很多代表根据自身的经历和经验，介绍了各种形式的国家资本主义所具有的、而为一般私人资本主义企业所不能具有的优点。很多代表都明确了私营工商业首先要安于合法经营，接受人民政府的管理，国营经济的领导和工人群众的监督，自己创造条件，争取符合国家的需要和可能，不论工业和商业都是可以有步骤、有区别地走上国家资本主义轨道的。
    这是大会的第二个重大的成就。
    第三、代表们一致认识到社会主义改造是一项长期的工作，要做好这项工作，私营工商业者必须把企业改造和个人改造结合起来。正如这次大会决议所指出：私营工商业者首先必须加强个人的思想和作风的改造，加强爱国守法的教育和国家对于私营工商业的利用、限制和改造的政策的教育。不断地和反复地展开批评与自我批评，对一切违法行为进行严肃的批评和斗争。唯有这样，私营工商业者才能逐步提高思想认识，端正经营作风，看清楚祖国远大的光明前途，认识到个人利益、局部利益、必须服从国家利益、人民利益的道理。
    这是大会的第三个重大成就。
    第四、根据李维汉副主任的指示，全体代表进一步地明确认识了私营工商业开展增产节约的重要意义和具体方向。对于国家建设来说，增产节约运动是不断改进生产，完成或超额完成国家计划的巨大动力；对于私营工商业来说，增产节约运动更有着改善公私关系和劳资关系，清除五毒和改革企业落后状态的特殊意义。代表们一致保证：为了实现第一个五年建设计划的光荣任务，私营工商业者必须在国家的计划轨道上，依据供、产、销平衡原则，积极进行增产节约，改善经营管理，提高生产技术，减低产品成本，提高产品质量，增产价廉物美的商品，为国家建设和供应广大人民的需要服务。
      这是大会的第四个重大成就。
    通过这次会员代表大会，正式成立了中华全国工商业联合会。工商业联合会是一个什么组织呢？它是领导工商业者遵守共同纲领及人民政府政策法令的组织；是代表各类工商业者特别是私营工商业者的合法利益的一种组织，也是私营工商业者团结、互助和进行自我改造的一种团体。今后，全国工商业联合会将在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，团结、教育全国工商业者。并使各行，各业，大、中、小户在各级工商业联合会和同业公会中各得其所、以便培养骨干，带领广大工商业者一道前进。
    经过二十一天的会议，虽则讨论和学习并不完全是平衡的，但代表们都感到在伟大的毛泽东时代作为一个爱国守法的私营工商业者是光荣的和幸福的。私营工商业是国家一项重要的经济因素，现在有合法的利润可得，将来和平进入社会主义社会的时候，有适当的工作可做。代表们都认为：在过渡时期总路线的光辉照耀下，我们私营工商业者能够加强学习，靠拢共产党和人民政府，爱国守法，积极改进生产，安于合法经营，就一定能够胜利地完成社会主义改造。等到和平进入社会主义社会的时候，和全国人民一起，共同享受社会主义社会的幸福生活。
    我相信全国私营工商业者通过这次大会，将在整个国家经济建设中贡献其更大的力量。
    一九五三年十二月五日
