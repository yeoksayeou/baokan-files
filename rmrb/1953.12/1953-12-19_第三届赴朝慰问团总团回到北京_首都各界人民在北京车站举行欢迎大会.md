He first extended a warm welcome and heartfelt gratitude on behalf of the people of the whole country to all members of the comfort group who had returned victoriously. He said, "Over the past two months, you have worked tirelessly, conducting widespread慰问(comfort visits) to the troops and local areas, greatly inspiring all commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army and the Korean people, and making the unity and friendship between the Chinese and Korean people even closer and stronger. This is a great contribution to jointly preventing enemy provocations and striving for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue." Guo Moruo then said: "American imperialism is afraid of peace. It spares no effort to continue sabotaging the POW explanation work, continues to obstruct the convening of political conferences, and recently even unilaterally and unreasonably interrupted the bilateral preliminary talks on political conferences, attempting to achieve its goals of forcibly detaining un-repatriated Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, obstructing the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and maintaining international tension. Under these circumstances, we, the people of the whole country, must heighten our vigilance and preparedness a hundredfold, and continue to strengthen the Resist America and Aid Korea movement to support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean people." Guo Moruo concluded: "We hope that you will deeply convey to the people of the whole country the great achievements of the Volunteer Army and their noble patriotism and internationalism, the heroic struggle of the Korean military and civilians and their great contribution to peace in the Far East and the world, and the close friendship and seamless unity between the Chinese and Korean people. It is hoped that through your communication, the people of the whole country will be encouraged to follow the general line of the country's transition period, strive to build the motherland, continue to heighten vigilance, thoroughly carry out the Resist America and Aid Korea movement, support the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean people, and fight to the end to achieve the thorough implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement and the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue."

General He Long, the head of the delegation, delivered a reply. (Full text to be published separately)
