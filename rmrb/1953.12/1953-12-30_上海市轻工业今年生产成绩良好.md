Xinhua News Agency Report:

    The seventy-one state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private light industry factories in Shanghai have achieved good production results in the first year of the national Five-Year Plan, playing a significant role in meeting the needs of heavy industry construction and the people's livelihood, and accumulating substantial construction funds for the country. As of December 20th, fifty-three factories had completed their annual output value plans. By the end of the year, the total output value of the factories will have increased by 100% compared to last year, while costs will have decreased by an average of 6% to 8%, resulting in an increase of over 140 billion yuan in net profit for the country throughout the year.

    This year, the characteristics of Shanghai's light industry factories' production are: greatly increased output, improved quality, a continuous stream of new products, and gradually reduced costs. The output of major products such as pharmaceuticals, food, daily necessities, cultural and educational supplies, bakelite powder, paint, drawing instruments, agricultural machinery, and fire-fighting equipment has increased from 100% to 800-900% compared to last year. Many newly successfully trial-produced products have begun mass production. Only one large X-ray machine was trial-produced last year, but it is expected that 35 units can be produced by the end of this year. Hospitals have proven that the quality of this type of X-ray machine is good. With the mass production of penicillin and sulfathiazole, which treat various inflammations, the output has increased by 700-800% compared to last year, and the cost has also been reduced by about 30%. The achievements made in pharmaceuticals, which were previously considered to be technically complex and problematic, in the first year of the Five-Year Plan have exceeded those of the past few decades. This has begun to lay a material foundation for improving the health of our people and developing health services. Shanghai's light industry has also made a great contribution to meeting the needs of the people nationwide, especially farmers. Agricultural insecticides and "223" emulsion are sold throughout the economic crop areas of the country. The rubber shoes, flashlights, bedsheets, towels, fountain pens, sewing machines, and other daily necessities used by the people have also been greatly improved and increased. When producing products that directly support national construction, the workers show even greater enthusiasm. This year, the output and quality of various drawing instruments, high-grade hard pencils, and special-grade bakelite powder have improved significantly after using domestically produced raw materials. The quality of waterline paint for painting ships has been improved. In the past, newly painted ships would have their paint peeled off after sailing once or twice. After adopting domestic raw materials and changing the formula, the "Peace No. 6" transport ship, which was painted with the improved paint, has sailed four times and still looks as good as newly painted.

    These achievements mark the gradual improvement of the production management level of various factories. Under the leadership of the Shanghai Light Industry Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, since the beginning of this year, various factories have carried out activities such as mobilizing the masses to discuss plans, improving product quality, and promoting work plans to improve the level of enterprise management, based on a democratic inspection of production management. Since the increase production and practice economy movement, the Party Committee has focused on improving quality, reducing costs, improving labor productivity, and striving for comprehensive and over-fulfillment of plans, and has mobilized the workers to launch a production competition centered on brainstorming, finding solutions, finding tricks, and proposing rationalization proposals, targeting the weak links in production.

    上海市轻工业今年生产成绩良好
    据新华社讯：上海国营、地方国营、公私合营七十一个轻工业工厂，在国家五年建设计划的第一年，又取得良好的生产成绩，在满足重工业建设和人民生活的需要方面，发挥了巨大的作用，并为国家积累大量建设资金。到十二月二十日，已有五十三个厂完成全年产值计划。到年底，各厂的生产总值比去年增加一倍，而成本平均比去年降低百分之六到八，全年为国家多增加纯利润一千四百多亿元。
    今年，上海轻工业工厂生产的特点是：产量大大提高，质量有了改善，新产品源源出现，成本逐步降低。医药、食品、日用品、文教用品、电木粉、油漆、绘图仪器、农业药械以及消防器材等主要产品的产量都比去年提高一倍到八、九倍。不少新试制成功的新产品已开始大量生产。大型爱克斯光机去年只试制了一部，预计今年年底就可以生产三十五部。这种爱克斯光机经医院使用证明，质量良好。医治各种炎症的青霉素和磺胺噻唑大量生产后，产量比去年提高了七、八倍，成本也降低了百分之三十左右。过去一般人认为技术高、问题复杂的医药，在五年建设计划的第一年所获得的成就超过了以往几十年，这就为提高我国人民健康水平和发展卫生事业，开始奠定了物质基础。上海轻工业对满足全国人民，特别是农民的需要上也有了很大贡献。农业杀虫剂和“二二三”乳剂行销全国各地经济作物地区。人民日常生活使用的胶鞋、手电筒、被单、毛巾以及金笔、缝纫机等也都有了很大改进和增加。在生产直接支援国家建设的产品时，职工们更显示出无限的热情。今年各种绘图仪器、高级硬铅笔、特级电木粉，在采用国产原料后，产量和质量都有了显著的进步。油漆轮船用的水线漆质量已经提高。过去刚漆过的轮船航行一两次，漆就剥落了，采用国产原料改变配方后，油漆过的“和平六号”运输轮，已航行了四次，还和新漆的一样。
    这些成就标志着各厂生产管理水平的逐步提高。在中共上海轻工业党委领导下，从今年年初起，各厂就在生产管理民主大检查的基础上，先后进行了发动群众讨论计划，提高产品质量以及推行作业计划，提高企业管理水平等工作。增产节约运动以来，党委又以提高质量、降低成本、提高劳动生产率、争取全面和超额完成计划为中心，发动职工群众针对生产中的薄弱环节，开展了以动脑筋、想办法、找窍门、提合理化建议为内容的生产竞赛。
