National Textile Industry Model Worker Zhou Zhizhen
Overfulfills Production and Thrift Plan Monthly

Dear fellow members of the Qu Yaoli Agricultural Production Cooperative:

I was so excited when I saw your reply to me in the People's Daily on November 1st that I read it in one breath. In order to harvest more cotton, providing us with raw materials for spinning and weaving, and meeting the people's needs, you have waged a tenacious struggle against various natural disasters. Thinking of you, I am more and more motivated in production, and I don't waste a single thread. I know that cotton is the result of your hard work.

A few days after I completed the production and thrift plan in October this year, the speed of the looms in the factory was faster than before, so I revised and improved my plan. I knew that if the machine was faster, more weft bobbins would be needed. In this case, if the weft loading, cloth inspection, and patrol are not sped up, there will be more passive shuttle changes (that is, when the weft yarn in the shuttle is used up, the machine stops and waits for someone to open it), and the machine will stop for a longer time. This will not only fail to increase production, but also waste more electricity and easily cause substandard cloth. In order to ensure the daily completion of the plan, I pondered a solution and decided that in addition to being as meticulous and stable as before in cloth inspection patrols and weft yarn loading, I must also be faster in the future and learn from other people's good experiences in my work. As a result, the number of times I had to passively change shuttles was reduced. Therefore, in October, I maintained the achievement of not weaving substandard cloth, and the total monthly output exceeded the original plan by four hundred and five feet. I also taught my experiences to others through performances, seminars, and other methods. The worker Li Fasheng used to weave substandard cloth all the time, so I often studied ways to prevent substandard cloth with them, and as a result, they did not produce a single piece of substandard cloth after October.

In early November, I increased my production plan based on the production results in October, increasing the average output per machine per day to thirty-seven yards (the October plan was thirty-six point six yards). However, in November, the climate changed, and the temperature and humidity in the workshop fluctuated greatly, so the yarn breakage rate increased dramatically. I was very anxious, but when I thought of the heroic deeds of the Volunteer Army hero Huang Jiguang and others who sacrificed themselves to defend the motherland, and when I thought of the countless model deeds that appeared on the construction front of the motherland, I felt that the difficulty of having many yarn breaks was nothing. At that time, I made up my mind that if you break a lot, I will connect it quickly! In this way, in November, I overfulfilled the plan by another two hundred and four feet and did not produce a single piece of substandard cloth.

At the end of November, all the staff in our factory studied the general line of the state during the transition period, and everyone's minds were bright. In the past, although I knew that we were going to build a happy socialist society, I always thought that the socialist society was far away. Now I know that our country is already transitioning to socialism step by step. All the staff in our factory are determined to complete the annual production and thrift tasks under the light of the general line's lighthouse, and to continuously improve production and strive for the early realization of socialism.

Finally, let me tell you a piece of good news: I was recently elected as the people's representative of our factory. I know that this honor should belong to all the people and to Chairman Mao. I must work harder to produce more, to thank the people for their concern for me.

    按月超额完成增产节约计划亲爱的曲耀离农业生产合作社全体社员同志们：
    在十一月一日人民日报上看到你们给我的复信，我兴奋得一口气就把它念完了。你们为了多收棉花，供给我们纺纱织布的原料，满足人民的生活需要，向各种自然灾害进行了顽强的斗争。一想到你们，我在生产上就越干越有劲，而且一根线头也不叫它浪费。我知道棉花是你们辛勤劳动所换来的啊。
    今年十月订完了增产节约计划以后不几天，厂里的布机速度比以前加快了，我就修改和提高了我的计划。我知道，机器快了，用的纬纱穗子就要多。在这种情况下，如果不加快装纬、查布面、巡回的话，被动换梭（就是梭子里的纬纱用完了，机器停着等人开）就要多，车停的时间就要长。这样不但提高不了产量，反而多浪费了电，也很容易造成次布。为了保证天天完成计划，我就琢磨办法，决定除了在查布面巡回、装纬纱等动作时要和以前一样做到细和稳以外，今后还必须做到快，并且在工作中要吸取别人的好经验。结果，我被动换梭子的情况，减少了。因此，十月份又保持了没织次布的成绩，全月产量超过原订计划四百零五市尺。我还把自己的经验用表演、座谈等方式教给别人。工人李法生过去老织次布，我就经常和他们一起研究防止次布的办法，结果他们在十月份以后也没出一匹次布。
    十一月初，我根据十月份的生产成绩提高了我的生产计划，把每台机器每天的平均产量提高到三十七码（十月份计划是三十六点六码）。可是十一月份气候有了变化，车间的温湿度忽高忽低，因此断头率大量增加。我很着急，可是一想起志愿军英雄黄继光等为了保卫祖国而不惜牺牲自己的英雄行为，一想起祖国建设战线上出现的无数模范事迹，就觉得断头多的困难简直算不了什么。当时我就下了决心，你断的多，我接的快！这样，十一月我又超额二百零四市尺完成了计划，没出一匹次布。
    十一月底，我厂全体职工学习了国家在过渡时期的总路线，大伙心眼都亮堂啦。过去自己虽然也知道我们要建设幸福的社会主义社会，可是总是认为社会主义社会是遥远的。现在才知道，我们国家已经在一步一步过渡到社会主义了。我们全厂职工都决心在总路线这个灯塔的光芒照耀下，完成全年增产节约任务，并不断提高生产，争取社会主义早日实现。
    最后，告诉你们一个喜讯：我在最近被选为我厂的人民代表。我知道，这个光荣应该属于全体人民，属于毛主席。我一定要更加努力地生产，来答谢人民对我的关心。
