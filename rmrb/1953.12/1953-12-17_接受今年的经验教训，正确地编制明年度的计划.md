Accept This Year's Lessons and Correctly Formulate Next Year's Plan

Zhang Xuewen
Director of Fuxin Mining Bureau

I. Where are the shortcomings in the 1953 planning work?

The first year of the first five-year plan is coming to an end. Over the past year, we have deeply realized that the production and construction work have been greatly affected due to the poor formulation of the annual plan. Looking back at the formulation and implementation of the 1953 annual plan, we feel that there are several main problems:

\t1. Insufficient preparation work before compiling the plan, and the plan lacks reliable basis. For example, the quota plan is based on the highest output in October 1952. We did not analyze the representativeness and reliability of this standard well, nor did we correctly estimate the possible situations in the implementation, which led to the revision of the efficiency quota three times. When compiling the material consumption quota, some were formulated according to the budget quota, and some were copied according to the material catalog, which was very different from the actual situation. This resulted in constant additions or reductions during the execution of the plan. For example, from January to May, in one hundred and twenty-five days, the materials for production and major repairs were added or reduced as many as ninety times.
\t2. There are only output and technical and economic quota plans, but no technical organization measures plan, and the realization of the plan is not guaranteed. For example, there is no detailed technical measures plan for the technical problem of fire extinguishing and grouting in thick coal seam mining areas, and the ventilation management is also poor, so from January to September, six sites including Ping'an No. 1 Mine and Xinqiu No. 1 Mine were threatened by fire and stopped coal mining, reducing coal mining by more than 33,000 tons. For example, when formulating the plan to add machinery and equipment, it was proposed how many scraper conveyors were needed, but no effective measures were taken to ensure its realization. As a result, the plan to improve production efficiency failed due to the untimely supply of scraper conveyors.
\t3. The balancing work of the plan was not done well, there was no overall picture, the problem was not analyzed comprehensively, and priorities were not distinguished, which increased the confusion in production. For example, when Ping'an Mine balanced the labor plan, it "balanced" out dozens of indispensable squad leaders, which affected the completion of the efficiency plan; some mines even cut off a part of the tunneling project, but in fact the tunneling could not be avoided, so the cost still exceeded the budget; some mines cut off the main material plan and saved unnecessary or secondary materials, which resulted in material backlog and waste on the one hand, and insufficient supply on the other hand. This made frequent additions and reductions afterwards, which increased the confusion and difficulties in the work and caused great losses to the country. From January to October, the capital of materials accumulated in production alone reached 13 billion yuan.

The main reason for the above shortcomings is that our leading cadres did not pay enough attention to the preparation of the plan. The people who were transferred to make the plan did not know much about the requirements of the plan and the actual production situation, and we did not give them the necessary explanation, nor did we carry out the necessary ideological education work. When reviewing the plan, we did not organize the participation of major technical personnel, which made the plan lack technical guidance. At the same time, the heads of various business departments did not participate in the preparation of the plan, and the cooperation was very poor. In the process of preparing the plan, there was a lack of necessary political work, and after the plan was made, the masses were not organized to review and discuss it. Therefore, this plan lacks both a reliable basis and a mass foundation.

II. How to prepare the 1954 production plan well

According to the requirements of the state, the output and quality indicators of Fuxin Mine in 1954 are higher than this year, and the cost should be lower than this year. In order to ensure the completion of the tasks assigned by the state, we must first prepare the plan well. There are many favorable conditions for preparing the 1954 plan, mainly because we have accepted the experience and lessons of this year, strengthened geological exploration and tunneling work in advance, and prepared relevant engineering drawings and instructions, so that the preparation of the 1954 plan can be carried out with goals and preparation. However, in order to prepare the plan better, the following points should also be paid attention to:

\t1. Give full play to the due role of the coal mining industry and prepare an advanced and correct plan. When preparing the 1954 plan, it is necessary to implement the policy of relying on existing mining areas, accelerating the construction of mines that are in progress, so that they can be put into production quickly, and making full use of existing equipment, constantly improving labor productivity, and ensuring the overfulfillment of the national plan. To this end, when formulating the plan, it is necessary to oppose the conservative idea of being afraid of setting high output quotas and low material consumption quotas, and on the basis of improving the quality of coal, implement the principle of less investment, more coal output, less consumption and more accumulation to meet the requirements of national industrialization. On the other hand, it is necessary to strengthen the preparatory work such as geology, tunneling and stripping, and have engineering drawings and instructions, and then propose planning measures accordingly. It is necessary to concentrate technical forces to go deep into the site to prepare and review the basic plan, mobilize employees to repeatedly discuss, deeply explore and carefully find, and avoid the previous practice of proposing indicators before finding the basis, so that the plan can be formulated correctly.
\t2. Strengthen the balance and review work in the preparation of the plan. The balance plan work should pay attention to the following principles: (1) It must be done, and if it is not done, it will affect production, it must be done, and it cannot be cut off casually; (2) For things that may improve production, the economic effect should be considered in detail, and if the effect is not great, it can be not done; (3) Projects that can be done or not or can be postponed should be reduced. In short, the balancing work should be done with a clear idea, distinguishing priorities and balancing correctly.

Strictly reviewing the plan can not only correct inaccuracies as early as possible and avoid troubles in next year's work, but also make up for the defects of insufficient data, improve the quality of the plan, and make the plan advanced and feasible. For this reason, it is necessary to: (1) Review the basis and correctness of the plan from all aspects: in terms of engineering, geological data, engineering development, and economic effects should be reviewed; in terms of technology, coal mining methods, roadway layout, machinery and equipment, and labor organization should be reviewed; in terms of quotas, technical and economic quotas, efficiency and material consumption quotas, quality quotas, and the degree of play of production capacity should be reviewed. (2) Adopt a evaluation method to review the advanced nature of the plan: the newly revised plan should be compared with the average advanced production standards after launching the competition in 1953, the degree of play of machinery and equipment efficiency and the balance of the allocation of spare parts should be reviewed, and potential forces should be further developed; the situation after the review should also be compared with the plan before the review, and various methods should be adopted to measure the advanced nature of the plan.

To do a good job in reviewing the plan, administrative responsible cadres, major engineering and technical personnel, and responsible comrades of various business departments must participate in person. At the same time, it is also necessary to educate and organize the masses and grassroots cadres to discuss and review the plan, expose and criticize the conservative thinking in the plan, and put forward rationalization proposals, so that the plan has a broad mass base. Finally, the bureau and mine will centrally balance various indicators, review technical organization measures, and make meticulous preparations for next year's production.

\t3. Grasp the key issues in the work and formulate a good technical organization measures plan. This year, the reason why production has improved after carrying out the increase production and practice economy competition and implementing planned management is mainly because the key of engineering technical measures was grasped. Therefore, we must accept this experience, and all key engineering technical organization measures related to the overall situation must be clearly listed in the plan, and the date of implementation must be determined by quarter and month. At the same time, the labor department should do a good job in labor organization measures, improve labor organization, equip direct production units with sufficient manpower, streamline unnecessary indirect personnel, tighten up institutions, and ensure the completion of the all-member efficiency plan. The mechanical and electrical equipment department should do a good job in mechanical equipment measures and concentrate its efforts to solve major equipment and transportation problems. In addition, in order to implement the policy of safe production, a specific safety measures plan must also be formulated in the annual plan to ensure the safe completion of the task.

\t4. Strengthen the political and ideological leadership in the planning work. According to the decision of the Fuxin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Party committees and mass work departments of various factories and mines will each send a strong responsible cadre to participate in the planning work, in order to strengthen the ideological leadership in the planning work and the organizational activities of the Party and the masses, so that the Party and the mass work departments can grasp the plan together with the administration. Only by doing a good job in the ideological education work of the masses can the plan be mastered by the masses, so that everyone can understand the seriousness of the national plan and ensure the completion of the national plan.

    接受今年的经验教训，正确地编制明年度的计划
    阜新矿务局局长  张学文
    一、一九五三年计划工作的缺点在那里
    第一个五年建设的第一年就快结束了。一年来，我们深刻地体会到，由于年度计划编制得不好，生产和建设工作都受到不少影响。现在回顾一下一九五三年度计划的编制与执行情况，感觉到有这样几个主要毛病：
    一、编计划前的准备工作做得不充分，计划缺乏确实可靠的根据。如定额计划是以一九五二年产量最高的十月份为标准的。我们没有很好地分析这个标准的代表性和可靠程度，也没有正确估计在执行中可能发生的情况，致使效率定额修改了三次。编制材料消耗定额时，有的是按照概算定额制订的，有的是按照材料目录单抄写的，与实际情况出入很大。这就造成了在执行计划时不断地追加或削减。如一至五月份一百二十五天中，生产和大修理的材料，追加或削减竟达九十次之多。
    二、只有产量和技术经济定额计划，没有技术组织措施计划，计划的实现没有保证。如对厚煤层采区灭火灌浆的技术问题没有周密的技术措施计划，加上通风管理又差，使一至九月平安一坑、新邱一坑等六个场子因受发火威胁而停止采煤，减少采煤量三万三千多吨。又如制订增添机械设备的计划时，提出刮板溜子要多少有多少，可是没有采取切实措施来保证其实现，结果由于刮板溜子的供应不及时，提高生产效率的计划便落了空。
    三、计划的平衡工作没有做好，心中无数，没有全面分析问题，不分轻重缓急，以致增加了生产中的混乱现象。如平安矿平衡劳动计划时，把不可缺少的班长“平衡”掉了几十名，结果影响效率计划的完成；有的矿竟把掘进工程削掉了一部分，实际上掘进不能不做，因此结果成本仍然超支；有些矿把主要的材料计划削掉了，保存了不必要的或次要的材料，因而造成了一方面材料积压浪费，一方面又供应不足。这样便使得事后频繁地追加追减，增加了工作中的混乱和困难，给国家造成了很大损失。一至十月份，仅生产方面所积压的材料资金即达一百三十亿元。
    造成上述缺点的主要原因是我们领导干部对编制计划重视不够。抽调来作计划的人对计划的要求和实际生产情况都不甚了解，而我们却没有对他们进行必要的解释，也没有进行必要的思想教育工作。在审查计划时，我们又没有组织主要技术人员参加，使计划失去了技术指导。同时，各业务部门的负责人没有参加编制计划，互相配合很差。在编制计划过程中，又缺乏必要的政治工作，计划订出来后，没有组织群众审查讨论。因此，这个计划既缺乏可靠的依据，又没有群众基础。
    二、如何编好一九五四年的生产计划
    根据国家要求，阜新矿一九五四年的产量、质量指标都比今年高，成本要比今年低，为了保证完成国家指定的任务，我们首先就要把计划编制好。编制一九五四年计划有不少有利条件，主要的是我们接受了今年的经验教训，事先加强了地质勘察和掘进工作，准备了有关的工程图纸及说明书等，使编制一九五四年计划有目标、有准备地进行。但是，为了把计划编得更好，还需要注意以下几点：
    一、发挥煤矿工业应有的作用，编制出先进的正确的计划。在编制一九五四年计划时，必须贯彻依靠现有采区，加速正在进行的矿井建设，使之迅速地投入生产以及充分利用现有设备，不断提高劳动生产率，保证超额完成国家计划的方针。为此，在制订计划时，必须反对怕把产量定额订高，怕把材料消耗定额订低的保守思想，要在提高煤的质量的基础上，贯彻少投资，多出煤，少消耗、多积累的原则，以满足国家工业化的要求。另一方面，又要加强地质、掘进及剥离等准备工作，要有工程图纸和说明书，再依此提出计划措施，要集中技术力量深入现场编制与审查基础计划，发动职工反复讨论，深挖细找，避免以往先提指标再找根据的做法使计划订得正确。
    二、加强编制计划中的平衡与审核工作。平衡计划工作要注意以下原则：（一）必须做，不做则影响生产的，一定要做，不能随便割掉；（二）对生产可能有改善，要详细考虑经济效果，如效果不大，可以不做；（三）可做可不做或可缓做的工程，一律削减。总之，平衡工作要做到心中有数，分别轻重缓急，平衡得正确。
    严格地审查计划，不但可以及早修正不确切之处，避免明年工作的麻烦；而且还可以补救资料不足的缺陷，提高计划的质量，使计划成为先进的和确实可行的。为此就要：（一）从各方面审查计划的根据和正确程度：在工程方面，应审查地质资料，工程发展，经济效果；在技术方面，应审查采煤方法，巷道布置，机械设备，劳动组织；在定额方面，应审查技术经济定额，效率及材料消耗定额，质量定额，生产能力发挥的程度。（二）采取评比办法，审查计划的先进程度：要将新订的计划与一九五三年发动竞赛后平均先进的生产标准对比，要审查机械设备效能的发挥程度和后备器材调拨平衡状况，进一步发挥潜在力量；还要将审查后的情况与审查前的计划作对比，采取各种方法来测量计划的先进程度。
    要作好审查计划的工作，一定要行政负责干部、主要工程技术人员及各业务处的负责同志亲自参加。同时，也必须教育和组织群众及基层干部讨论和审查计划，揭发和批判计划中的保守思想，提合理化建议，使计划有广泛的群众基础。最后由局、矿集中平衡各种指标，审查技术组织措施，为明年生产做好缜密的准备工作。
    三、抓住工作中的关键问题，订好技术组织措施计划。今年在开展增产节约竞赛、实行计划管理后，生产所以好转，主要是抓紧了工程技术措施这一关键。因此，我们必须接受这个经验，凡有关全局关键性的工程技术组织措施都必须于计划中明确列出，并分季分月确定实施的日期。同时，劳动部门应做好劳动组织措施，改善劳动组织，给直接生产单位配备足够的人力，精减不必要的间接人员，紧缩机构，保证全员效率计划的完成。机电及设备部门要作好机械设备措施，集中力量解决主要设备及运输问题。此外，为了贯彻安全生产的方针，在年计划中还必须订出具体的安全措施计划，以保证安全地完成任务。
    四、加强计划工作中的政治思想领导。根据中共阜新市委的决定，各厂矿党委和群众工作部门各派一名较强的负责干部参加计划编制工作，以加强计划工作中的思想领导和党与群众组织活动，使党和群众工作部门与行政一起掌握计划。只有做好群众的思想教育工作，才能使计划为群众掌握，使大家认识国家计划的严肃性，保证完成国家计划。
