Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 4th: The Central South Administrative Committee issued a directive on November 27th regarding winter agricultural production work, requesting all levels of people's governments in the region to earnestly mobilize and organize peasants to launch a winter production campaign, in order to prepare for next year's production. The directive emphasized: Seizing the opportunity to launch a winter production campaign is key to achieving the victorious completion of next year's increased production plan. If winter production is left unattended and leadership is relaxed, it will inevitably cause serious difficulties for next year's increased production campaign, affecting the production of grain and cotton, which is detrimental to the nation's industrial construction. The directive puts forward the following content and requirements for the winter production campaign: All localities should follow the principle of "focusing on large-scale construction of small-scale water conservancy projects," seize the time, and, based on local needs and possibilities, mobilize peasants to repair and build new ponds, dams, ditches, reservoirs, and water wells, etc., insist on focusing on building new small-scale reservoirs to expand water storage facilities and enhance drought resistance capabilities; and promote rational water use and water conservancy management experience, and effectively resolve water conservancy disputes. In this regard, all localities should actively lead on the one hand, and avoid the mistakes of greed, excessive ambition, and blind advancement on the other. All localities should mobilize peasants to launch a fertilizer accumulation campaign, implement the principle of "household manure accumulation as the main method, with commercial fertilizers as a supplement," pay attention to exploring fertilizer sources, and pay attention to discovering and summarizing peasants' fertilizer accumulation experiences and promote them. Cooperatives in all localities should fully prepare commercial fertilizers based on the actual needs of local peasants and supply them in a timely manner. The climate in Central South is relatively warm. In all fields where winter planting is possible, all localities should mobilize peasants to plant as many early-maturing crops as possible without hindering the planting of major crops next spring; and mobilize peasants to do a good job in field management to ensure good planting and growth. Wheat areas must achieve full seedling protection to eliminate the phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken ridges. All fields that can be winter-plowed should mobilize peasants to plow early and deeply, and, based on the principle of "prevention is better than cure" in pest control and several years of work experience, mobilize peasants to eliminate insect eggs, with particular attention to eliminating overwintering rice borers, cotton bollworms, locusts, and wheat midges, and other major pests and insect eggs. However, this work must be carried out relying on mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and prevent coercion and commandism. In addition, all localities should attach importance to livestock maintenance and guide peasants in sideline production. It is necessary to strictly distinguish between speculative commercial activities and sideline production, and support peasants in carrying out various sideline productions such as oil extraction, charcoal burning, transportation, fishing and hunting, and weaving, etc., in accordance with local conditions, to increase peasants' income. Cooperatives in all localities should vigorously organize this work. Regarding the preparation of improved varieties needed next spring and the repair of agricultural tools, it is also necessary to mobilize peasants to do a good job in winter. The directive concluded by pointing out: In carrying out the above work, it is necessary to closely integrate it with the current grain purchase work, and widely educate peasants on the Party's general line during the transition period, in order to encourage peasants' patriotism and enthusiasm for increased production, and at the same time, strengthen the leadership of existing mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and earnestly do a good job in focusing on the development of agricultural producers' cooperatives, so that the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement can be further launched on a large scale next spring.

    中南行政委员会指示全区各级人民政府
    组织农民开展冬季生产运动
    【新华社武汉四日电】中南行政委员会在十一月二十七日发出冬季农业生产工作的指示，要求全区各级人民政府认真发动和组织农民开展冬季生产运动，为明年生产作好准备。指示强调指出：抓紧开展冬季生产运动，是争取明年增产计划胜利完成的关键。如果对冬季生产放任自流，放松领导，必将造成明年增产运动的严重困难，影响粮食和棉花的生产，不利于国家工业建设。指示提出冬季生产运动的内容和要求如下：各地应遵照“以大量兴修小型水利为主”的方针，抓紧时机，根据当地的需要和可能，发动农民整修和新建塘堰、堤坝、沟渠、水库、水井等水利工程，坚持重点新建小型水库，以扩大蓄水设备，增强抗旱能力；并推广合理用水和水利管理经验，切实解决水利纠纷。对此，各地应一方面积极领导，一方面避免贪多贪大、盲目冒进的错误。各地应发动农民开展积肥运动，贯彻“农家积肥为主，商品肥料为辅”的方针，注意发掘肥源，注意发现和总结农民的积肥经验加以推广。各地合作社应根据当地农民的实际需要，充分准备商品肥料，及时供应。中南气候较暖，凡可以冬种的田地，各地应在不妨碍明春种植主要作物的原则下，动员农民尽可能多种各种早熟作物；并动员农民做好田间管理，保证种好、长好。小麦地区要作到全苗保苗，消灭缺苗断垅现象。凡可冬耕的田地，应动员农民早耕深耕，并根据“防重于治”的除虫方针和几年来的工作经验，发动农民消灭虫卵，尤须注意消灭过冬的螟虫、棉虫、蝗虫及小麦吸浆虫等主要害虫和虫卵。但进行这一工作须注意依靠互助合作组织，并防止强迫命令。此外，各地应重视耕畜保养工作和领导农民的副业生产。必须把投机商业活动和副业生产严加区别，扶助农民因地制宜地进行榨油、烧炭、运输、渔猎、编织等各种副业生产，以增加农民的收入。各地合作社应大力组织这一工作。关于明春需要的优良品种的准备，农具的修补，也要动员农民在冬季作好。指示最后指出：进行以上工作，必须与当前购粮工作密切结合，广泛对农民进行国家在过渡时期的总路线的教育，以鼓舞农民爱国增产的热情，同时要加强对已有互助合作组织的领导，认真作好重点发展农业生产合作社的工作，以便明春进一步大规模地开展农业生产互助合作运动。
