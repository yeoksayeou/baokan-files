The CCP Zhejiang Province Hang County Committee convened a meeting of 2,144 district and township cadres and village cadre activists to study and discuss the general line and general task of the state during the transition period. Through listening to reports, recalling comparisons, and calculating detailed accounts, the cadres present received a profound socialist education, greatly encouraging their determination and confidence to struggle for the realization of the state's general line and general task during the transition period.

The meeting first pointed out the achievements of the county in various aspects over the past four years and the benefits that farmers had received: In the land reform movement, more than 172,000 landless and land-poor farmers were allocated land and became masters of their own fate. Under the leadership of the People's Government, various construction projects were also carried out. For example, in terms of water conservancy, in just four years after liberation, the county built 24,000 water conservancy projects, protecting more than 500,000 mu of farmland from floods. The county's rice production in 1952 increased by more than 90% compared to 1949, exceeding the pre-war peak level by 15%. This year's rice production increased by more than 8% compared to last year. Subsequently, leading comrades of the county committee explained in simple and concrete terms the achievements of the motherland in industrial construction: In the four years since liberation, the state has opened many large factories and mines, and will build more large factories like the Anshan Iron and Steel Company in the future; in rural areas, it will lead farmers to organize mutual aid teams and establish more agricultural producers' cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives. Those that have already been established will be run even better. In this way, socialist industrialization will be realized step by step, and the socialist transformation of agriculture will be realized step by step. The happy life of the Soviet people was used to illustrate the future prospects of the Chinese people, giving the cadres present great encouragement. The general reflection was: The general line is such a bright road to prosperity for everyone. We must go back and use all our energy to mobilize the farmers in the whole village and township to do a good job in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, strive to increase production, save food, and support national construction.

After the cadres clearly understood the socialist road, the meeting focused on solving the cadres' understanding of socialist industrialization and the relationship between industry and agriculture. Among the 2,100 cadres present, more than 80% were of peasant origin, and most had little or no experience with large-scale industry. Therefore, many people had a one-sided view of agriculture, such as thinking that "all things are born from the soil, and farmers are the greatest" and "of the 360 trades, farming is the most important." They also lacked sufficient understanding of the importance of the state concentrating its main efforts on developing heavy industry. The meeting solved this problem by calculating accounts and making comparisons. The first account used concrete facts to illustrate the relationship between industry and agriculture, making the cadres present generally realize that workers and farmers have an inseparable relationship. The second account compared machine production with handicraft production: which is better? Which is more important? The district cadres compared waterwheels and water pumps, wooden boats and ships, stone mortars for milling rice and machine rice mills, handcarts and automobiles, and hand-cranked spinning wheels and spinning machines. The meeting further guided the cadres to compare wooden plows with tractors, gradually leading them from personal experience to recognize the importance of developing heavy industry. For example, cadres from Tangqi District said in their recollections: During this year's drought resistance, 36 mu of land in 14 villages of Chaoshan Township originally required five waterwheels and 32 laborers to irrigate the land in one day. As a result, a water pump was installed, and the land was filled in five hours. The wages alone saved 330,000 yuan, and water chestnuts were planted in time. Cai Yongfa said: "If there had been no water pump this year, my household would have harvested five dan less rice." Based on the above ideological foundation, everyone was guided to recall the suffering they had endured when the Japanese devils invaded China, thereby realizing that national industrialization is an important condition for consolidating national defense and protecting production.

After all the cadres realized the importance of gradually realizing national socialist industrialization, the county committee leadership promptly guided the cadres to recognize that the result of taking the capitalist road would inevitably be the enrichment of a few and the suffering of the vast majority. Through typical speeches at the general assembly and widespread grievance sessions in groups, the facts of how unscrupulous merchants and usurers exploited farmers through the free market were exposed. The cadres present were mostly emancipated peasants who had suffered from the exploitation of speculative merchants, and they all angrily denounced the unscrupulous merchants and usurers. Pang Jinsong, a poor peasant from Chaoshan Township, borrowed a high-interest loan from a rich peasant one year because his father died, in order to pay for medicine and buy a coffin. As a result, the interest piled up, and he could not repay the loan. He was forced to mortgage five mu of land and worked as a long-term laborer for the rich peasant for several years before he was emancipated after the land reform and allocated land. Cadres from Pingyao District complained: "Before liberation, the more abundant the harvest, the more the farmers suffered, because the rice was worthless when the harvest was good, but those who came to collect rent and taxes and demand interest would not let go of you!" Shen Zixiang, a farmer from Nanshan Township in Siwei District, said that during the Kuomintang rule, he sold a sheep and three chickens on the first day, but when he went to town to buy rice the next day, he could only buy two packs of cigarettes. At the same time, everyone realized that although the activities of private merchants in the rural free market have been restricted since liberation, there are still unscrupulous merchants engaging in speculation and usury, which seriously affects the interests of farmers. For example, Chen A'da and four other households in Er Village, Shuangqiao Township, amassed a large amount of capital to engage in speculative trading. When poor peasants and hired laborers sold a large amount of broad beans, they bought them at a low price of 680 yuan per catty and hoarded them. When farmers urgently needed broad bean seeds for sowing, they sold them at a high price of 1,100 yuan. After being educated by these concrete facts, the cadres realized the various benefits of the state controlling grain and resolved to lead the farmers to sell grain to the state.

The meeting also used vivid facts to enlighten everyone to recognize the instability of the small-peasant economy: it is weak and unable to withstand the impact of natural disasters, and it cannot enable farmers to escape poverty. The cadres present then recounted with great sadness the hardships brought to them by the small-peasant economy. Yang Renrong, a poor peasant from Luoshan Township, Dongtang District, sold all three mu of land he had been allocated after the land reform due to insufficient labor and the impact of natural disasters; 103 households in Pingyao District lost their land again, and 129 households sold their houses. A few usurers in the countryside, relying on their grain and money, ruthlessly exploited small farmers, causing many people to go bankrupt. For example, Chen Maojin, a usurer in Beizhaohe Township, lent Chen Xianggen, a farmer, 1.2 dan of rice. After a year, Chen Xianggen could not repay the debt and was forced to mortgage his only house to him.

Subsequently, the leaders of the county committee guided the cadres to recognize the benefits of being organized. Jiang Hongyuan, the director of the county's first agricultural producers' cooperative, recalled: "This year, we overcame the drought, and the cooperative's rice production increased by more than 10% compared to last year. The average yield of ramie per mu was more than 400 jin, which was higher than the harvest of local mutual aid teams. This is all thanks to the cooperative!" After recalling the situation of the district's bumper harvest this year after fighting the drought, cadres from Shangsi District said: This year's drought was much more severe than in 1934, but this year, because everyone was organized and used water pumps, we finally overcame the drought and achieved a bumper harvest. Through recalling and comparing, the cadres realized that only by organizing and taking the road of mutual aid and cooperation can everyone become prosperous. Cadres from Tianwan Township, Qiaosi District, said: There are very few cases of buying and selling land in Cangqian Township, and the living standards of farmers have improved because mutual aid and cooperation have been done well, blocking the capitalist road. They guaranteed to the district committee that they would strengthen leadership over mutual aid and cooperation when they returned. Zhang Yulai, the township head of Dongqing Township, Shangsi District, saw that others made more money doing business and was unwilling to be a cadre. He had requested to go home six times. After recognizing the socialist road this time, he made a self-criticism at the meeting and said: "Thank Chairman Mao, this time you led me from the crossroads to the right path!" He also said that he would work hard in the future. Chen Jiantong and his wife, township cadres from Sandun District, made a self-criticism of their mistake of hoarding grain for speculative trading and said that they would sell all their surplus grain to the state. One hundred and five cadres from Siwei District expressed their determination to take the lead in doing a good job in mutual aid teams, take the lead and mobilize farmers to sell surplus grain to the state, and take the socialist road. Some rural cadres in Shangsi District wrote letters home during the meeting, urging their parents to sell their surplus grain to the cooperative as soon as possible. After returning to Cangqian Township, Qiaosi District, cadre Fei Zifu promptly dissuaded his mother from buying rice for hoarding.

    中共杭县县委召开全县区、乡、村干部会议
    用事实对比的方法教育干部认清两条道路
    中共浙江省杭县县委集中全县二千一百四十四个区乡干部和村干部积极分子举行会议，学习与讨论了国家在过渡时期的总路线总任务。通过听报告、回忆对比、算细账，使到会干部受到了一次深刻的社会主义教育，大大鼓舞了他们为实现国家在过渡时期总路线总任务而斗争的决心与信心。
    会议首先指出了该县四年来各方面的工作成就，农民得到的好处：土地改革运动中十七万二千多个无地少地的农民分到了土地，翻身作了主人。在人民政府领导下又进行了各项建设工作。如在水利方面，解放后仅仅四年，全县就修了二万四千处水利，使五十多万亩田免受水患。全县水稻产量一九五二年比一九四九年提高了九成多，超过了战前最高水平百分之十五。今年水稻比去年增产百分之八多。随后县委领导同志又通俗而具体地说明了祖国在工业建设方面的成就：解放四年来国家开办了许多大工厂、许多大矿山，今后还要办更多的像鞍山钢铁公司那样的大工厂；在农村中领导农民组织互助组，办更多的农业生产合作社、供销合作社。已经办的，把它办得更好。这样，一步步地实现社会主义工业化，一步步地实现农业的社会主义改造。并用苏联人民的幸福生活来说明中国人民的未来远景，给予到会干部以极大的鼓舞。普遍反映：原来总路线就是这样一条使大家富裕的光明大道，回去得用足劲带动全村全乡农民搞好互助合作运动，努力增产，节约粮食，支援国家建设。
    在干部明确认识了社会主义道路后，会议便集中力量解决干部对社会主义工业化和工农业关系的认识问题。到会的二千一百多个干部中，百分之八十以上是农民出身，大部没有或很少见过大工业，因此不少人对农业有片面的看法，如认为“万物土里生，农民为最大”、“三百六十行，种田头一行”。对国家集中主要力量发展重工业的重要性也认识不足，会议用算账对比的办法解决了这个问题。第一笔账用具体事实说明了工业和农业的关系，使到会干部普遍认识到：工人和农民是有着血肉不可分离的关系的。第二笔账算机器生产与手工业生产那样好？那样重要？各区干部拿水车和抽水机比，拿木船和轮船比，拿石臼打米和机器碾米比，拿手拉车和汽车比，拿手摇纺车和纺纱机比。会议并进一步引导干部拿木犁比拖拉机，由近到远地逐步使干部从切身体验出发认识到发展重工业的重要性。如塘栖区干部在回忆中说：今年抗旱时超山乡十四村三十六亩田原来要五部水车，三十二个劳动力车一天才能灌上水，结果装上了一部抽水机，五个钟头就灌满了水，单单工资就节约了三十三万元，还及时种上了荸荠。蔡永法说：“今年如果没有抽水机，我一户就得少收五石米。”在上述思想基础上，又引导大家回忆了日本鬼子侵略中国时所受的痛苦，从而认识到国家工业化是巩固国防、保卫生产的重要条件。
    全体干部认识了逐步实现国家社会主义工业化的重要性以后，县委领导方面又及时地引导干部认识走资本主义道路的结果，必然是少数人发财，绝大多数人受苦。通过大会典型发言、小组普遍进行诉苦的方法，揭发了奸商、高利贷者通过自由市场剥削农民的事实。到会干部大都是翻身农民，都经受过投机奸商盘剥的痛苦，他们纷纷以痛恨的心情控诉了奸商和高利贷者。超山乡贫农庞金松，有一年因父亲病死，向富农借了一笔高利贷，还药款买棺材，结果利上加利他还不起，被押走了五亩田不算，还给富农当了几年长工，土地改革后他才翻了身，分到了田。瓶窑区干部控诉说：“解放以前农民是越丰收越受苦，因为丰收了稻谷不值钱，而讨租税，要利息的却又盯住你不放手！”四维区南山乡农民沈子祥说，国民党统治的时候第一天卖了一只羊、三只鸡，第二天赶到镇上去买米时，却只够买两包烟了。同时，大家认识到，解放后虽然私商的活动在农村的自由市场上已受到限制，但仍有奸商投机倒把，高利盘剥，严重影响农民的利益。如双桥乡二村陈阿大等四户集结大量资金从事投机买卖。他们乘贫农、雇农大量出卖蚕豆时，以每斤六百八十元的低价收进，囤积起来；而在农民下种迫切需要蚕豆种籽时，又以一千一百元高价出卖。经过这些具体事实的教育，干部认识到国家掌握粮食的各种好处，决心领导农民把粮食卖给国家。
    会议又用生动的事实启发大家，认识小农经济的不稳定性：它身单力薄，经受不起自然灾害的打击，不能使农民摆脱贫困。到会干部遂以沉痛的心情诉说了小农经济所带给他们的苦处。东塘区洛山乡贫农杨仁荣因劳动力不足，再加上自然灾害的打击，把土地改革后分到的三亩田卖光了；瓶窑区有一百零三户重新失去了土地，一百二十九户出卖了房子。农村中少数高利贷者则仗着手中有粮有钱，狠毒地剥削小农户，使许多人破产。如北肇和乡高利贷者陈茂金借给农民陈祥根一石二斗米，过了一年，陈祥根还不起债，被迫把仅有的一间住房押给他。
    随后，县委领导同志又引导干部认清组织起来的好处。全县第一个农业生产合作社社长江洪元回忆说：“今年战胜了旱灾，全社水稻又比去年增产了一成多，络麻产量每亩平均有四百多斤，比当地互助组的收成高。这全是合作社的好处呀！”上泗区干部回忆了今年抗旱全区丰收的情况后说：今年的旱情比一九三四年要严重得多，可是今年由于大家组织起来，使用抽水机，终于战胜了旱灾，获得了大丰收。通过回忆对比，干部认识到只有组织起来走互助合作的道路，才能使大家富裕。乔司区天万乡干部说：仓前乡买卖土地的情形很少，农民生活有提高，就是因为互助合作搞得好，把资本主义的路口堵住了。他们向区委提出保证：回去一定要加强对互助合作的领导。上泗区东清乡乡长张玉来，看到别人做生意赚钱多，不愿当干部，曾六次要求回家；这次认清了社会主义道路后，在会上作了检讨，说：“多谢毛主席，这次把我从十字路口引到了正路！”并表示今后一定要努力工作。三墩区乡干部陈见通夫妻俩，检讨了囤粮作投机买卖的错误，表示一定把全部余粮卖给国家。四维区有一百零五个干部表示了决心，一定带头搞好互助组，带头并发动农民把余粮卖给国家，走社会主义的道路。上泗区有的乡村干部在会议期间写信回家，动员父母把余粮及早卖给合作社。乔司区仓前乡干部费子福回去后，及时劝阻了母亲买米囤积的行为。
