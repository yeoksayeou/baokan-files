The CCP Zhejiang Provincial Committee recently convened a meeting of responsible cadres from provincial, prefectural, and some county-level key point townships to summarize and exchange experiences in publicizing the Party's general line and general task for the transition period to farmers and in carrying out grain requisition and purchase work.

The meeting held that: After the implementation of propaganda and education on the general line and general task, the socialist consciousness of farmers has been greatly enhanced, and the countryside has undergone new changes. Farmers, recalling the continuous development of production and the continuous improvement of material and cultural living standards over the past four years, have further recognized the greatness and correctness of the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and have recognized that the only correct and bright path is to gradually transition to a socialist society through mutual aid and cooperation. From their own experience, farmers have deeply realized the fragility of the small-peasant economy and the exploitation by speculative merchants, which are the root causes hindering the development of agricultural production and preventing farmers from ultimately escaping poverty. Farmers must organize themselves and take the road of mutual aid and cooperation in order to live a happy and prosperous life. Because farmers' consciousness has been raised under the brilliant light of the general line, their production enthusiasm is high, and the planting area of spring flowers has generally been expanded compared to last year, and they are actively selling grain to support national construction. According to reports from the three townships of Sihe, Yonghe, and Songyan in Xindeng County, after farmers' consciousness was raised, the entire township sold surplus grain to the state, and used the money from grain sales to promptly buy back means of production or deposit it in the People's Bank as production funds for next year. Many farmers are actively requesting to join mutual aid teams and agricultural producers' cooperatives. Farmers who were originally prepared to withdraw from teams and cooperatives are now not withdrawing, and some mutual aid teams are actively preparing to establish agricultural producers' cooperatives. The three townships of Sihe, Yonghe, and Songyan in Xindeng County are preparing to establish 25 more agricultural producers' cooperatives before the spring plowing next year.

After discussion, the meeting affirmed the basic experience of key point work: To do a good job in key point work, the Party committee must strengthen leadership and equip it with strong cadres. For example, the key point townships in Xindeng, Shouchang, and Haiyan counties have achieved better results in key point work because the provincial, prefectural, and county Party committees attached importance to leadership and personally took charge. The Fuyang and Dongyang county Party committees took detours because they relaxed leadership over key point work. In strengthening leadership over key point work, it is necessary to organize cadres participating in key point work to repeatedly and deeply study the general line, systematically and comprehensively understand the basic spirit of the general line, and first and foremost clarify in their minds that the general line is the lighthouse illuminating all work. The deeper the farmers' masses accept socialist ideas through in-depth publicity and implementation of the general line, and the deeper the criticism of capitalist exploitation, and the clearer the boundaries are drawn, the stronger the ideological foundation for implementing the general line will be. Therefore, this propaganda and education work must be carried out conscientiously, deeply, and extensively, and must not be carried out carelessly. It cannot be regarded merely as ideological mobilization for the task of purchasing grain. Grain purchase work must be carried out on the basis of conducting general line propaganda and education among farmers and raising their socialist consciousness. In the process of grain requisition and purchase, it is necessary to repeatedly explain policies to farmers in light of their various ideological situations when conducting general line education. In addition, general line propaganda and education and grain purchase work must be combined with the current urgent production requirements of the masses and must be combined with the personal experiences of the farmers. It is necessary to be good at using the local masses' language to carry out propaganda in a vivid and popular manner, and to adopt methods such as leading the masses to recall, compare, and calculate accounts based on their own experiences to educate farmers, and to prevent the tendency of dogmatism. The success or failure of the general line propaganda and education work in a township mainly depends on whether the masses have been fully mobilized, and whether the socialist consciousness of the farmers has been raised, that is: farmers have full enthusiasm for production, consciously and willingly support the general line with practical actions, sell surplus grain to the state, and support national construction; and clearly recognize the direction of mutual aid and cooperation, so that the mutual aid and cooperation movement can be greatly advanced.

The meeting held that: To implement general line education, the following three basic links must be grasped:

First, cadres entering rural areas must first rely on the local Party branches (where there are no branches, temporary branches can be established by Party members in the work team), grasp the current production demands of the masses, formulate specific current production targets, and arrange production well; at the same time, convene various small-scale seminars in the process of implementing production to collect local information and the language of the masses, mainly the changes in the political, economic, and cultural aspects of the township before and after liberation, the current political and economic dynamics of various classes, the situation of mutual aid and cooperation, the masses' views on grain purchase issues, and what one-sided or erroneous statements we have made in the past in publicizing socialism, so as to prepare for the propaganda and education of the general line.

Second, holding a township-wide meeting of activists and carrying out in-depth general line education is the key to mobilizing the masses to complete the task after fully mobilizing the masses. The meeting should be held in two stages: first, conduct general line education to raise socialist consciousness, and then conduct education on grain purchase policies, so that the cadres attending the meeting consciously accept the grain task. To hold a good meeting, it is necessary to make a specific and vivid report, using local specific examples and language that is easy for the masses to understand, using account-settling and comparison methods, from near to far, from the present to the future, and from the specific to the principle, in order to have significant results. To hold a good meeting, it is also necessary to set good topics, organize discussions well, and use methods such as recalling, comparing, complaining, and settling accounts, and consciously guide them to complain about the suffering of the small-peasant economy and the suffering of speculative merchants and usurers, so that the backbone elements recognize that the old capitalist road cannot be taken, criticize capitalist ideas, and ensure that they lead the masses to enthusiastically sell grain to the state and actively participate in mutual aid and cooperative organizations.

Third, after the meeting of township-wide activists, the general line propaganda work should be widely and deeply carried out among the masses with this group of backbone elements as the core and with the village as the unit, so that it is well known to every household and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. In terms of methods, village meetings, meetings of youth, women, the elderly, militia, demobilized soldiers, and propagandists can be held first, and at the same time, small-scale seminars and individual education can be carried out separately according to specific different situations and different objects. It is necessary to ensure that every farmer understands the basic content of the general line, raises socialist consciousness, and achieves the expected requirements in production, mutual aid and cooperation, and grain purchase.

The meeting summarized the experience of grain purchase work. The meeting also studied the future key point work. The meeting pointed out that: After the implementation of general line education, the face of the countryside has been changing, the production enthusiasm of the masses is full, and various tasks in the countryside have been further advanced; however, after the completion of the grain purchase task, some cadres have begun to develop the idea of rest, and have not paid enough attention to some new demands of the masses, and some outstanding issues have not been properly handled. Accordingly, it is necessary to continue to implement the propaganda and education of the general line through self-examination and comparison from the bottom up, carry out the movement to increase production and practice thrift and mutual aid and cooperation, do a good job in winter production, actively prepare for all aspects of next year's large-scale production, and combine it with the completion of the general election and Party building work. Townships where general line propaganda and education is not deep or thorough should carry out "make-up lessons." Pay attention to summarizing and studying experience, and set off a high tide of increasing production and practicing thrift and mutual aid and cooperation.

Finally, Wu Zhichuan, Minister of the Rural Work Department of the CCP Zhejiang Provincial Committee, made a summary report at the meeting. Tan Qilong, Secretary of the CCP Zhejiang Provincial Committee, also came to the meeting to give important instructions on key point work. He pointed out that the key point experiment work has basically met the province's pre-determined requirements. He called on all localities to conscientiously implement the spirit of this key point work meeting, pay attention to summarizing the experience of unfolding from points to areas, and be very vigilant against the destructive activities of the enemy, especially in a few places where key point work has not been done well, find out the reasons, summarize the lessons, and the Party committee must personally take charge and ensure that the key point work is improved.

    中共浙江省委召开干部会议
    总结基点乡总路线宣传工作经验
    中共浙江省委于最近召开了省委、地委和部分县委基点乡的负责干部会议，总结和交流向农民宣传党在过渡时期的总路线总任务及进行征粮购粮工作的经验。
    会议认为：在贯彻总路线总任务的宣传教育后，农民的社会主义觉悟大大提高，农村面貌已有新的改变。农民从回忆四年来生产的不断发展和物质文化生活水平的不断改善中，进一步认识到共产党、毛主席领导的伟大和正确，认识到通过互助合作一步一步过渡到社会主义社会是唯一正确的光明大道。农民从切身经验，深刻认识了小农经济的脆弱性和投机奸商的盘剥，是阻碍农业生产发展、农民不能最后摆脱贫困的根源，农民要过幸福美好的生活，就一定要组织起来走互助合作的道路。由于农民在总路线的光辉照耀之下，觉悟提高，因而生产情绪高涨，春花种植面积大都比去年扩大，并踊跃售粮支援国家建设。据新登县四合、永和、松堰三个乡的报告，农民觉悟提高后，全乡把余粮卖给国家，并以卖粮所得的钱及时买回生产资料或存在人民银行里作为明年的生产资金。许多农民都积极要求参加互助组和农业生产合作社，原来准备退组退社的农民现在也不退出了，有些互助组还在积极准备办农业生产合作社。新登县四合、永和、松堰三个乡就准备在明年春耕前增办二十五个农业生产合作社。
    会议经过讨论，肯定了基点工作的基本经验：要搞好基点工作，党委必须加强领导，配备强有力的干部。如新登、寿昌、海盐县的基点乡，由于省委、地委、县委领导方面重视，亲自掌握，基点工作就搞得较好；富阳、东阳县委对基点工作放松领导，就走了弯路。在加强对基点工作的领导中，必须组织参加基点工作的干部反复深入地学习总路线，系统地、全面地弄通总路线的基本精神，使之在思想上首先明确认识总路线是照耀着一切工作的灯塔。深入宣传与贯彻总路线，农民群众对社会主义思想接受得越深，对资本主义剥削批判得越深，界限划得越清楚，贯彻总路线的思想基础便越牢固。因此，这一宣传教育工作必须认真地深入广泛地进行，决不容许草率从事，不能把它仅仅作为收购粮食这一项任务的思想动员。购粮工作必须在向农民进行总路线宣传教育，提高农民社会主义觉悟的基础上进行。在征粮、购粮工作中，向农民进行总路线教育时，必须针对农民的各种思想情况，反复交代政策。此外，总路线宣传教育和购粮工作必须与群众当前迫切的生产要求相结合，必须与农民的切身体验相结合，善于使用当地群众的语言，生动通俗地进行宣传，并采用领导群众以切身经验进行回忆对比算账等方法来教育农民，防止教条主义的偏向。一个乡总路线宣传教育工作的好坏，主要是看群众是否已经充分发动，农民的社会主义觉悟是否已经提高，即：农民有饱满的生产热情，自觉自愿地以实际行动拥护总路线，把余粮卖给国家，支援国家建设；并明确认识互助合作方向，使互助合作运动大大向前推进一步。
    会议认为：贯彻总路线教育，必须掌握下列三个基本环节：
    第一，进入乡村工作的干部必须首先依靠当地党的支部（没有支部的，可以工作组党员建立临时支部），抓住群众当前的生产要求，订出当前具体生产指标，布置和安排好生产；同时在贯彻生产中召开各种小型座谈会，收集当地情况和群众语言，主要是该乡解放前后政治、经济、文化各方面的变化，目前各阶层的政治、经济动态，互助合作的情况，群众对购粮问题的看法，及过去我们在宣传社会主义中有什么片面的或错误说法等，做好贯彻总路线宣传教育的准备工作。
    第二，开好全乡积极分子大会，深入进行总路线教育，在群众充分发动的基础上再布置购粮任务，这是发动群众完成任务的关键。会议应分二段进行，先进行总路线教育以提高社会主义觉悟，再进行购粮政策的教育，使到会干部自觉接受粮食任务。要开好会议必须做好一个具体生动的报告，用当地具体事例和群众易懂的语言，以算账对比方法，由近及远，由眼前到将来，由具体到原则，才能有显著效果。要开好会议还要出好题目，组织好讨论，运用回忆、对比、诉苦、算账的方法，有意识地引导他们诉小农经济之苦，诉投机奸商、高利贷者之苦，使骨干分子认识资本主义老路是走不得的，批判资本主义思想，保证带领群众踊跃卖粮给国家，积极参加互助合作组织。
    第三，在全乡积极分子会议结束后，即以这批骨干为核心，以村为单位在群众中广泛深入地开展总路线的宣传工作，达到家喻户晓，深入人心。做法上可先召开村民大会，青年、妇女、老年人、民兵、转业军人、宣传员等会议，同时根据具体不同情况和不同对象，分别开小型座谈会和进行个别教育。务使每个农民都懂得总路线的基本内容，提高社会主义觉悟，在生产、互助合作、购粮等方面都达到预定的要求。
    会议总结了购粮工作的经验。对今后基点工作也做了研究。会议指出：贯彻总路线宣传教育后，农村面貌已在改变，群众生产情绪饱满，农村各项工作都向前推进一步；但在完成购粮任务后，部分干部已开始产生了休息思想，对群众中产生的若干新的要求还未引起足够的重视，另外，有些遗留问题还未妥善地进行处理。据此，必须通过自下而上的总结评比，继续贯彻总路线的宣传教育，开展增产节约和互助合作运动，搞好冬季生产，积极为明年大生产做好各方面的准备工作，并结合完成普选和建党工作。总路线宣传教育不深、不透的乡，要进行“补课”。注意总结研究经验，掀起增产节约和互助合作运动的高潮。
    会议最后由中共浙江省委农村工作部吴植椽部长做了总结报告。中共浙江省委书记谭启龙同志并到会对基点工作作了重要指示。他指出：这次基点试验工作基本上达到了省委的预定要求。他号召各地要认真贯彻这次基点工作会议精神，注意总结由点到面展开的经验，要十分警惕敌人的破坏活动，特别是少数基点工作未做好的地方，要找出原因，总结出教训，党委必须亲自掌握，务使基点工作提高一步。
