    The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government issued the following "Notice on Winter Prevention and Control of Plant Diseases and Insect Pests" on November 28th:
    In the past, disease and pest control work in various regions generally focused on the spring, summer, and autumn seasons. Not enough attention has been paid to winter disease and pest control. Experience in recent years has shown that thorough winter disease and pest control can reduce the occurrence of diseases and pests in the coming year and save a lot of manpower and material resources. In order to do a good job in preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests this winter, the following points are specifically put forward, and it is hoped that all localities will refer to them for implementation:
    1. In locust-prone areas and areas with residual autumn locusts this year, locust control agencies should conduct egg surveys, mark the locations, and record the distribution and density of locust eggs, accurately estimate the area with eggs, and formulate or revise locust control plans. In areas where the egg survey work has not been completed this winter, a supplementary survey should be conducted when the ground thaws next spring.
    2. Winter destruction of rice roots is an effective way to control rice borers. Due to different conditions in rice-growing areas, it is necessary to determine practical and feasible methods for treating rice roots based on specific conditions. Last year, some areas did not treat the plowed and dug-up rice roots, which affected the rice borer control effect. This year, all localities should pay attention to the rice root treatment work, such as using them for composting, fertilizer accumulation, burning, etc.
    3. In orchards, residual branches, fallen leaves, and fallen fruits should be removed and burned, and methods such as scraping old bark and sealing tree holes should be adopted to prevent pear leafrollers, small heartworms, and apple rot. In areas with customs, plowing orchards can also help control pests such as citrus fruit flies and jujube weevils.
    4. Clean up fields, such as removing cotton stalks, digging up and burning grain stubble, clearing weeds, fallen leaves, fallen bolls, and weeds in the fields and beside the fields, to eliminate overwintering pests such as rice stem borers, millet stem borers, cotton aphids, pink bollworms, and blind stink bugs, and reduce the occurrence of insect pests next year.
    5. Winter plowing not only increases soil fertility and retains soil moisture, but also reduces the occurrence of diseases and insect pests in the coming year. In areas where winter plowing is currently feasible, manpower and animal power should be organized in a timely manner for winter plowing.
    6. Fully prepare medicines and equipment. In addition to cleaning up existing medicines and equipment this winter, a plan should be made for next year based on the actual needs of the masses, and preparations should be made as early as possible, and the repair and maintenance of powder sprayers and sprayers should be organized.
    7. In the past, due to the failure to truly master the technology in the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, many deviations have occurred, and many accidents have occurred, especially in the use of highly toxic pesticides. In order to do a good job in the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests next year, training should be conducted for cadres in various ways in light of local conditions to improve prevention and control technology and prepare conditions for the promotion and use of medicines and equipment next year.

### 中央人民政府农业部关于冬季防治病虫害的通知

    中央人民政府农业部关于冬季防治病虫害的通知
    中央人民政府农业部在十一月二十八日发出“关于冬季防治病虫害的通知”如下：
    过去各地进行防治病虫害工作，一般多注意春、夏、秋三个季节；对于冬季防治病虫害工作，还未能引起足够的重视。几年来经验证明：凡冬季防治病虫害做得彻底，即可减少来年病虫害的发生，并可节省许多人力和物力。为了作好今冬防治病虫害工作，特提出以下几点，希各地参考执行：
    一、在飞蝗原产地区和今年有残余秋蝗的地方，应由治蝗机构进行查卵工作，做出标志，并记载蝗卵分布和密度，正确估计有卵面积，制订或修正治蝗计划。今冬没有完成查卵工作的地方，来春大地解冻时，应补查清楚。
    二、冬季毁灭稻根是治螟的有效办法。由于稻区情况不同，必须根据具体条件，决定切实可行的处理稻根办法。去年有些地区对耕起、掘起的稻根没有处理，影响了治螟效果。今年各地应注意稻根处理工作，如用以沤粪、堆肥、烧毁等等。
    三、在果树园地，应清除残枝、落叶、落果、聚集烧毁，和采用刮老树皮、封闭树洞等办法，以防治梨星毛虫、小食心虫及苹果腐烂病等。在有习惯的地区可进行翻耕果园，对防治柑蛆、枣步曲等害虫也有作用。
    四、清洁田地，如拔除棉秸，刨烧谷茬，清除田间藁秆、落叶、落铃以及田间地旁杂草，以消灭过冬害虫，如二化螟、谷子钻心虫、棉蚜、红铃虫、盲椿象等，减轻明年虫害的发生。
    五、冬耕不但会增加土壤肥沃性和保持土壤水分，又可减少来年病虫害的发生。在目前可行冬耕地区，应及时组织人力和畜力进行冬耕。
    六、充分准备药械。今年冬季除清理现存药械外，应根据群众实际需要，做出明年计划，及早准备，并组织对喷粉器、喷雾器的修配工作。
    七、过去防治病虫害，由于未能确实掌握技术，以致发生了不少偏差，特别在使用剧毒性农药上，曾发生不少事故。为了做好明年防治病虫害工作，应针对各地运用各种方式，进行干部训练，提高防治技术为明年药械推广和使用准备条件。
