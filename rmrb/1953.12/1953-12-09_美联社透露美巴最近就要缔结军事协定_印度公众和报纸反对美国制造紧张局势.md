Xinhua News Agency, December 8th: TASS, New York, December 7th: An AP correspondent in Karachi reported that during US Vice President Nixon's visit to Pakistan, there was widespread "rumor that the United States will conclude an agreement in the shortest possible time to provide Pakistan with massive military aid under the Common Security Program. Pakistani and American figures in Karachi believe that the conclusion of the agreement is only a matter of time and point out that some of the preparations for the conclusion of the agreement have been completed."

Xinhua News Agency, December 8th: TASS, London, December 5th: "The Manchester Guardian" published an editorial expressing concern about the news of negotiations between the United States and Pakistan on military bases. The newspaper said, "There is much evidence to suggest that negotiations for military cooperation have taken place."

Xinhua News Agency, December 8th: An article published in the American magazine "Newsweek" on November 30th once again exposed the US conspiracy to turn Pakistan into a base for aggression and drag Pakistan into the so-called "first line of defense in the Middle East" of the Middle East aggressive bloc. Accompanying the article was a US map of the so-called "first line of defense in the Middle East." The map shows that this "defense" line is composed of Turkey, which has already joined the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, as well as Iran and Pakistan. The map also includes symbols for Pakistani bases and US-British military bases in the Near and Middle East.

The article, after mentioning Eisenhower and Dulles' denials, revealed: "Diplomatic observers believe that although no agreement has been reached between the United States and Pakistan, where there's so much smoke, there must be fire. It is no secret that the United States wants to pull Pakistan, which has an army and strategically important air bases, into the Middle East defense organization. ...The negotiations that have already taken place involve the issue of possibly granting Pakistan a substantial military aid program, similar to the aid given to Turkey."

The article then cited the views of "senior US officials," admitting that it is currently "difficult, if not impossible," to pull Arab countries into the Middle East aggressive bloc. Therefore, the US aggressive plan in this region must rely on Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan. The article bluntly talked about the Pakistani army and said, "There are two first-class airfields near Karachi, one civilian and one military. Both can be used by jet aircraft. These airfields will expand the current network of US-British air bases." The article continued: Therefore, Pakistan can "quickly" become a US aggression base comparable to Turkey, thereby forming the two flanks of the so-called "first line of defense in the Middle East" together with Turkey.

Xinhua News Agency, December 8th: According to TASS, Delhi: During US Vice President Nixon's activities in India from November 29th to December 4th, he was strongly protested by the Indian public and press. They saw that the purpose of Nixon's trip to Asia was to exacerbate tensions on the Asian continent. This view is further evidenced by the fact that, as the "Indian Express" said, India, in addition to its differences with the United States on the issues of China and Korea, now has new suspicions due to the rumored negotiations for a US-Pakistan military agreement. The "Statesman" wrote: The US-Pakistan negotiations on concluding a military agreement are aimed at exerting indirect pressure on India.

Many Indian members of parliament issued a statement accusing Nixon of being an ardent supporter of McCarthyism, the United States of opposing India's participation in the Korean political conference, and of supporting Syngman Rhee.

Xinhua News Agency, December 8th: According to TASS, Delhi, December 7th: According to a "Times of India" correspondent in Karachi, US Vice President Nixon, who arrived in Karachi on the 6th after a two-day visit to Afghanistan from India, has held discussions with the Pakistani government on the possibility of concluding a military alliance between the two countries.

India's "National Herald" mentioned the anti-Indian trend in US foreign policy in an editorial, and recounted that it was the United States that opposed India's participation in the Korean political conference; it was also the United States that instigated the Syngman Rhee gang to take anti-Indian actions; and it was none other than Dulles who wantonly slandered the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in Korea, chaired by India. The newspaper said that the above are only the most obvious anti-Indian actions taken by the US authorities. The recent preparations for the conclusion of the US-Pakistan military treaty are further evidence of US hostility towards India.

### 美联社透露美巴最近就要缔结军事协定  印度公众和报纸反对美国制造紧张局势

    美联社透露美巴最近就要缔结军事协定
    印度公众和报纸反对美国制造紧张局势
    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社纽约七日讯：美联社驻喀喇蚩记者报道，当美国副总统尼克松访问巴基斯坦的时候，正广泛地“谣传美国在最短期内将缔结根据共同安全计划给予巴基斯坦以巨大军事援助的协定。喀喇蚩的巴基斯坦和美国人士认为，缔结协定仅不过是时间的问题，并指出：筹备缔结协定的部分工作已经完成了。”
    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社伦敦五日讯：“曼彻斯特卫报”发表社论，对于美国和巴基斯坦就军事基地问题进行谈判的消息表示忧虑。该报说：“有许多证据可以证明曾进行了军事合作的谈判。”
    【新华社八日讯】十一月三十日出版的美国“新闻周刊”发表的一篇文章，再一次暴露了美国把巴基斯坦变为侵略基地、把巴基斯坦拉进所谓  “中东第一线防御”的中东侵略集团的阴谋。和文章同时刊载的还有一幅美国的所谓“中东第一线防御”图。图上表明这一道“防御”线由已加入北大西洋侵略集团的土耳其以及伊朗和巴基斯坦组成。图中并有巴基斯坦基地和美英在中近东军事基地的标志。
    文章在提到艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯的否认声明以后透露：“外交观察家认为，虽然美国和巴基斯坦之间还没有达成协议，但是冒这么大的烟，必定有火种。美国想把拥有军队和具有战略意义的空军基地的巴基斯坦拉进中东防御组织，这已经不是什么秘密了。……已经举行的谈判涉及可能给予巴基斯坦相当大的军事援助计划问题，这种援助类似给予土耳其的援助。”
    文章接着援引“美国高级官员”的看法，承认目前要把阿拉伯国家拉进中东侵略集团，“如果不是不可能的话，也是很困难的”。因此，美国在这个地区的侵略计划，必须依靠土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦。文章露骨地谈到巴基斯坦的军队，并且说：“在喀喇蚩附近有两个头等飞机场，一个是民用的，一个是军用的。两个都能够供喷气式飞机使用。这些飞机场将扩大目前的美英空军基地网。”文章接着说：因此，巴基斯坦能够“很快地”变为可以与土耳其相比拟的美国侵略基地。从而和土耳其构成所谓“中东第一线防御”的两个侧翼。
   【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社德里讯：美国副总统尼克松于十一月二十九日至十二月四日在印度活动期间，曾遭到印度公众和报界的强烈抗议。他们看出，尼克松这一次到亚洲来的用意，在于使亚洲大陆上的紧张局势加剧。这种看法由下面的事实得到进一步的证明：正如“印度快报”所说，印度除了在中国和朝鲜问题上和美国有分歧之外，现在又因传闻中的美巴军事协定的谈判，而发生新的猜疑。“政治家报”写道：美巴关于缔结军事协定的谈判，目的在于对印度施以间接的压力。
    印度许多国会议员发表了一项声明指责尼克松是麦卡锡主义的热心拥护者，美国反对印度参加朝鲜政治会议并支持李承晚。
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社德里七日讯：据“印度时报”驻喀喇蚩记者报道，从印度到阿富汗活动两天后于六日抵达喀喇蚩的美国副总统尼克松，已和巴基斯坦政府就缔结两国之间的军事同盟的可能性进行了讨论。
    印度的“国家之骄傲报”在社论中提到美国外交政策中的反印度趋势，并追述说，反对印度参加朝鲜政治会议的就是美国；怂恿李承晚匪帮采取反印度行动的也是美国；对于在朝鲜由印度代表担任主席的中立国遣返委员会滥加诬蔑的不是别人，也正是杜勒斯。该报说，以上只是美国当局所采取的反印度行动的荦荦大端而已。最近为缔结美巴军事条约而作的准备工作，是美国仇视印度的又一明证。
