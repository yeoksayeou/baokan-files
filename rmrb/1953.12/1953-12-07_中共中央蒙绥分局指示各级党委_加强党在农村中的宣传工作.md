The CCP Central Inner Mongolia-Suiyuan Sub-Bureau recently instructed Party committees at all levels to strengthen political work in rural areas and vigorously publicize the general line of the state during the transition period to the peasants.

The Inner Mongolia-Suiyuan Sub-Bureau pointed out that during the transition period, the Party's basic task in rural areas is to complete the socialist transformation of the agricultural economy, that is, to gradually incorporate the scattered small-peasant economy into the orbit of national planned construction, and guide peasants to take the socialist road of mutual assistance and cooperation. The task of our Party's propaganda work in rural areas must also proceed from this basic task. Therefore, it is necessary to proceed from the peasants' immediate interests and practical experience, and conduct vigorous publicity to all peasant masses, so that every peasant understands the general line of the state during the transition period, and understands the necessity of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of the small-peasant economy; to educate peasants to actively and steadily take the socialist road and develop the mutual assistance and cooperation movement; to educate peasants to increase production and practice economy, improve agricultural production technology, produce more grain and industrial raw materials needed by the state, and call on peasants to sell surplus grain to the state, support national industrial construction, and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.

Regarding the leadership of rural propaganda work, the Inner Mongolia-Suiyuan Sub-Bureau made specific regulations in the instructions: First, Party committees at all levels must attach importance to the Party's political work in rural areas and conscientiously guide the Party's propaganda work in rural areas. Second, strengthen the leadership of various mass propaganda organizations in rural areas, especially the Party's propaganda network; according to the new situation and new tasks in rural areas, put forward the work tasks of the propaganda network, and change the organizational form, activity methods, and leadership methods. Third, all localities should closely integrate the general line propaganda with the grain purchase work in the propaganda, and Party committees at all levels must send people to the countryside to assist in the work; in the work, attention should be paid to giving play to the strength of various local propaganda organizations, and attention should be paid to cultivating local Party propaganda cadres. Fourth, appropriately expand the Party's propaganda institutions, and systematically improve the theoretical level and professional ability of propaganda work cadres below the banner and county levels.

Finally, the Inner Mongolia-Suiyuan Sub-Bureau emphasized that some counties and districts, due to opposing "Five Excesses," have regarded the Party's necessary political work and propaganda network organizational activities in rural areas as "Five Excesses" and have virtually canceled them, which is a wrong approach. It is also wrong for some cadres to one-sidedly emphasize the immediate interests of the peasants, cater to the peasants' spontaneous capitalist tendencies, and fail to guide the peasants to take the socialist road.

    中共中央蒙绥分局指示各级党委
    加强党在农村中的宣传工作
    中共中央蒙绥分局最近指示各级党委，加强农村中的政治工作，大张旗鼓地向农民宣传国家过渡时期总路线。
    蒙绥分局指出：在过渡时期内，党在农村的基本任务乃是完成对农业经济的社会主义改造，也就是逐步实现把分散的小农经济纳入国家计划建设的轨道之内，引导农民走互助合作的社会主义道路。我们党在农村的宣传工作任务也必须从这一基本任务出发。因此必须从农民的切身利益和实际经验出发，向全体农民群众进行大张旗鼓的宣传，使个个农民都懂得国家过渡时期的总路线，懂得社会主义工业化和小农经济实行社会主义改造的必要；教育农民积极地、稳步地走社会主义的道路，发展互助合作运动；教育农民增产节约、提高农业生产技术，更多地生产粮食及国家所需要的工业原料，并号召农民把余粮卖给国家，支援国家工业建设，巩固工农联盟。
    关于农村宣传工作的领导，蒙绥分局在指示中作了具体规定：第一，各级党委必须重视党在农村中的政治工作，认真指导党在农村中的宣传工作。第二，加强对农村中各种群众性的宣传组织，特别是党的宣传网的领导；根据目前农村的新形势新任务，提出宣传网的工作任务，改变组织形式、活动方法以及领导方法。第三，各地在宣传中应把总路线宣传与购粮工作密切结合起来，各级党委并须派人下乡协助工作；在工作中要注意发挥当地各种宣传组织的力量，注意培养当地党的宣传干部。第四，适当扩充党的宣传机构，并有计划地提高旗、县以下宣传工作干部的理论水平和业务能力。
  最后，蒙绥分局着重指出：部分县、区由于反“五多”，把党在农村中必要的政治工作、宣传网组织活动也当作“五多”，无形加以取消，这是错误的做法。有些干部片面地强调农民的眼前利益，迁就农民的资本主义自发倾向，不引导农民走社会主义的道路，也是错误的。
