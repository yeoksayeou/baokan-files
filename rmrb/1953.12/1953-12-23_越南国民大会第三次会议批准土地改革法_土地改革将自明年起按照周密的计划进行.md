From mid-November to early December this year, the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party, the First National Cadre Conference of the Vietnam Workers' Party, the National Committee of the Vietnam National United Front, and the Vietnam National Assembly were held separately to discuss and adopt resolutions stipulating the implementation of land reform during the war of resistance, abolishing imperialist land monopoly in Vietnam and the feudal system of land ownership of the landlord class, and realizing the slogan "land to the tiller."

The program of the Vietnam Workers' Party on the land issue has been fully supported by the National Committee of the Vietnam National United Front, and then the Vietnam National United Front suggested to the government and the Vietnam National Assembly to approve this program.

At the historic Third Session held in early December 1953, the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, after listening to the reports of President Ho Chi Minh and Deputy Prime Minister Pham Van Dong, enthusiastically discussed and approved the Land Reform Law proposed by the government based on the program of the Vietnam Workers' Party on the land issue.

Land reform will begin in 1954 and will be carried out gradually, cautiously, and according to a detailed plan in the areas stipulated by the government. The purpose of this land reform is to improve the living standards of farmers, strengthen the people's power, promote production competition, and advance the war of resistance.
