　　The Vietnamese people's liberation war against imperialist aggression and for national independence has been going on for seven years. Today, all peace-loving and freedom-loving people are delighted with the great victories won by the Vietnamese people in their long struggle, and extend warm congratulations to the Vietnamese people.
　　Seven years ago, on December 19, the French imperialists tore up the "Franco-Vietnamese Agreement" before the ink was dry, destroyed the peace obtained by the Vietnamese people after the victory of the anti-fascist war, and perfidiously launched a full-scale military offensive against the young Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The French aggressors were confident that they could occupy all of Vietnam's territory, restore colonial rule, and re-enslave the Vietnamese people in a short period of a few months. However, the Vietnamese people resolutely implemented a comprehensive resistance, which shattered the French aggressors' and American interventionists' dream of a "quick victory." The aggressors have become increasingly mired in the quagmire of the war of aggression against Vietnam.
　　For the past seven years, under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnam Workers' Party, the Vietnamese people have united more and more closely, overcome serious difficulties, persisted in the arduous cause of resistance, and defended the Democratic Republic of Vietnam created by the August Revolution. The Vietnamese people's democratic regime has carried out democratic construction and social reforms in the environment of resistance, gradually improving the political, economic, and cultural lives of the broad masses of the people, and fully developing the enthusiasm of the whole people for resistance. Thanks to the full support of the Vietnamese people, the Vietnamese People's Army has grown from a force of only a few battalions to a regular army of hundreds of thousands of people. Its equipment, technology, and political qualities have been greatly improved, and it has demonstrated strong combat effectiveness in guerrilla warfare, mobile warfare, and siege warfare. In the tempering of the long war, the Vietnamese people and their armed forces have obviously become stronger.
　　In the seven years of war, the Vietnamese People's Army liberated most of the territory and people, and annihilated more than 320,000 invading troops. In the Border Campaign of 1950, the Hoa Binh Campaign of 1951, and the Northwest Campaign of 1952, the Vietnamese People's Army won significant victories, which greatly changed the situation in Vietnam. The Vietnamese people's resistance base areas have been expanding and consolidating, while the few cities and transportation lines occupied by the French army have fallen into difficulties. The Vietnamese People's Army has gained and maintained the initiative in the war on the main battlefield, causing the aggressors' vital forces to be annihilated more and more, and the balance of military power between the two sides is developing in a direction favorable to the Vietnamese people. The French aggressors, aided by the United States, have replaced several generals in an attempt to reverse the unfavorable situation, but all have failed. Now, the French aggressors are facing an increasingly serious military and political crisis. This is the basic situation in Vietnam after seven years of war.
　　The great victories won by the Vietnamese people in the seven years of liberation war have proved that a nation that dares to fight for freedom and independence is invincible, that a people who resolutely resist imperialist aggression are invincible, and that a just cause supported by the people of the world is invincible. If the French imperialists, who launched an unjust colonial war seven years ago, do not accept this lesson today, they will surely suffer even greater hardships.
　　The French government has spent 3 trillion francs to carry out this dirty war. This year, France's military expenditure for aggression against Vietnam has even reached 600 billion francs. This inevitably puts France's finances and economy in a state of disrepair and brings great disasters to the French people. The French working class and the broad masses of the people, under the leadership of the French Communist Party, have always resolutely opposed the war of aggression against Vietnam. Recently, the mass movement of the French people against the Vietnam War has developed more powerfully. Almost all people from all walks of life in France unanimously oppose prolonging this war and advocate stopping the war through consultation. During the French National Assembly's debate on the Vietnam issue in October this year, in addition to the Communist deputies, there were 151 non-Communist deputies who opposed the Vietnam War. French Prime Minister Laniel had to admit: "The Indochina War is unpopular in France."
　　However, the US imperialists, who have always supported the French war of aggression against Vietnam, are desperately implementing a policy of prolonging and expanding the Vietnam War. After being forced to reach a truce in Korea, the United States, in order to maintain international tension, has successively allocated 785 million US dollars to France as military expenditure for aggression against Vietnam, in order to incite the flames of war in Vietnam. The United States is constantly putting pressure on France, forcing France to engage in military adventures in Vietnam. At the Bermuda Conference of the United States, Britain, and France, Eisenhower insisted that France must continue the war of aggression against Vietnam. Admiral Radford, Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, recently stated openly: "We hope that with our aid program, military activities in the Indochina region will be strengthened." This shows that US imperialism is the most ferocious enemy of the Vietnamese people and all people who demand freedom and independence. It also shows that the United States is more seriously endangering France's national interests and national independence. Everyone knows that the United States is using the Vietnam War to drag down and weaken France, in order to force the French government to obey the United States more obediently and completely lose its ability to be independent and autonomous.
　　The Vietnamese people's determination to fight for their national independence and for peace is firm and clear. President Ho Chi Minh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam pointed out in his "Letter to the People and Army of the Whole Country" on the eve of the 7th anniversary of the nationwide resistance war in Vietnam: "Because the French colonialists are still continuing the war of aggression, the Vietnamese people are determined to give them heavier blows, annihilate more of the enemy's vital forces, and carry out the resistance to the final victory. However, if the French government is willing to achieve a truce in Vietnam through negotiations and peacefully resolve the Vietnam issue, the people and government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are willing to negotiate with the French government." President Ho Chi Minh had already made a statement on November 26 this year when answering questions from a reporter from the Swedish "Expressen": "The French government must stop its hostile acts, and then a truce in Vietnam can be achieved. The basis for this truce is that the French government truly respects Vietnam's independence." President Ho Chi Minh has repeatedly expressed the heroic Vietnamese people's love for peace and freedom, which has won the warm support of the French and peace-loving people all over the world.
　　The Vietnamese people's victorious struggle against imperialist aggression and for national independence has powerfully strengthened the cause of peace and democracy of the people of the world. The powerful world peace forces, after winning the truce in Korea, are more concerned with supporting the just struggle of the Vietnamese people in order to strive for further relaxation of the international situation. In October this year, the Third World Trade Union Congress decided that December 19 would be "International Day of Active Support for the Vietnamese People and the Struggle to Stop the Colonial War in Vietnam." In November, the general resolution adopted by the Vienna Conference of the World Peace Council also pointed out that the Vietnam War should be ended through negotiations. The Chinese people are joining hands with the peace-loving people all over the world to warmly respond to these calls, more actively rise up to support the Vietnamese people's struggle for independence and peace, and resolutely stop the imperialists' conspiracy to prolong and expand the Vietnam War.
　　The heroic Vietnamese people's resistance war is bound to be victorious. As President Ho Chi Minh said in his "Letter to the People and Army of the Whole Country": "In order to defend national independence and world peace, our army and people have been carrying out a heroic resistance war and have achieved many major victories. With the increasing unity of our people and the increasing active support of the French people and peace-loving people all over the world, our resistance war will surely achieve victory." The Chinese people firmly believe that the great and just cause of the Vietnamese people's heroic struggle for Vietnamese national independence and world peace, supported by the people of the world, will surely achieve greater and final victory.

### 越南人民的英勇抗战一定胜利

    越南人民的英勇抗战一定胜利
    越南人民为了反对帝国主义侵略、争取民族独立而进行的解放战争，已经七周年了。今天，一切爱好和平与自由的人们，都为越南人民在长期斗争中所赢得的伟大胜利感到欢欣，并向越南人民表示热烈的祝贺。
    七年前的十二月十九日，法帝国主义撕毁了墨迹未干的“法越协定”，破坏了越南人民在反法西斯战争胜利后所获得的和平，背信弃义地向年轻的越南民主共和国发动了全面的军事进攻。法国侵略者满以为在几个月的短时期内，就可以占领越南全部国土，恢复殖民地统治，重新奴役越南人民。但是，越南人民坚决实行了全面的抗战，使法国侵略者和美国干涉者“速战速决”的梦想宣告幻灭。侵略者在侵越战争的泥淖中已愈陷愈深。
    七年以来，越南人民在胡志明主席和越南劳动党的领导下，日益紧密地团结起来，克服严重困难，坚持了艰苦卓绝的抗战事业，捍卫了八月革命所缔造的越南民主共和国。越南的人民民主政权，在抗战的环境中进行民主建设和社会改革，使广大人民的政治、经济和文化生活逐步改善，全民的抗战积极性得到充分发扬。由于越南人民的全力支援，越南人民军已从一支只有几个营的部队发展成为数十万人的正规军，它的装备、技术和政治素质大为提高，并在游击战、运动战和攻坚战中表现了坚强的战斗力。在长期战争烽火的锻炼中，越南人民及其武装力量显然是变得更加强大了。
    越南人民军在七年来的战争中，解放了大部的国土和人民，歼灭侵略军三十二万多人。在一九五○年的边境战役，一九五一年的和平战役和一九五二年的西北战役中，越南人民军获得具有重大意义的胜利，使越南战局发生了很大变化。越南人民的抗战根据地日益扩大和巩固，法军所占据的少数城市和交通线则陷于困境。越南人民军在主要战场上取得并保持了战争的主动权，使侵略者有生力量越来越多地被歼灭，双方军事力量的对比正向对越南人民有利的方面发展。在美国援助下的法国侵略者调换几次将领，企图扭转对自己的不利形势，但都宣告失败了；现在，法国侵略者正面临着日益严重的军事危机和政治危机。这就是经过七年战争后的越南的基本形势。
    越南人民在七年解放战争中所获得的伟大胜利，证明了勇于争取自由与独立的民族是不可战胜的，证明了坚决反抗帝国主义侵略的人民是不可战胜的，证明了得到全世界人民支持的正义事业是不可战胜的。在七年前发动不义的殖民战争的法帝国主义，今天如果不接受这个教训，它就一定会要吃更大的苦头。
    法国政府为了进行这场肮脏的战争，已经消耗了三万亿法郎。今年法国的侵越军费更达六千亿法郎。这就不可免地使法国的财政经济陷于千疮百孔的地步，并给法国人民带来极大灾难。在法国共产党领导下的法国工人阶级和广大人民，一直就坚决反对侵越战争。近来，法国人民反对越南战争的群众运动更有了强大的发展。几乎所有法国各阶层人士，都一致反对再把这个战争延长下去，而主张用协商方式停止战争。在今年十月间法国国会辩论越南问题时，除了共产党议员外，还有一百五十一名非共产党议员反对越南战争。法国总理拉尼埃也不得不承认：“印度支那战争在法国是不得人心的。”
    但是，一直支持法国侵越战争的美帝国主义，却拚命执行延长和扩大越南战争的政策。美国在朝鲜被迫停战后，为了保持国际紧张局势，竟先后拨款七亿八千五百万美元给法国作为侵越军费，以煽动越南战火。美国不断地对法国施加压力，逼迫法国在越南进行军事冒险。在美英法百慕大会议上，艾森豪威尔坚持法国必须继续侵略越南的战争。美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福最近更公然说：“我们希望，靠我们的援助计划，印度支那地区的军事活动将可增强。”这说明了美帝国主义是越南人民以及
  一切要求自由独立的人民的最凶恶的敌人，同时也说明了美国正在更严重地危害法国的民族利益和民族独立。谁都知道，美国正借着越南战争拖住和削弱法国，以迫使法国政府更依顺地听凭美国的摆布，而完全失去独立自主的能力。
    越南人民为自己的民族独立、为和平而斗争的决心是坚定而明确的。越南民主共和国胡志明主席在越南全国抗战七周年纪念日前夕发表的“告全国军民书”指出：“由于法国殖民者仍然继续进行侵略战争，越南人民决心给他们更沉重的打击，更多地歼灭敌人的有生力量，把抗战进行到最后胜利。但是，如果法国政府愿意通过谈判在越南实现停战，和平解决越南问题，越南民主共和国的人民和政府是愿意和法国政府谈判的。”胡志明主席在今年十一月二十六日答瑞典“快报”记者问时已经做了声明：“法国政府必须停止敌对行为，然后越南停战便可实现。这种停战的基础就是：法国政府真正尊重越南的独立。”胡志明主席一再地表达了英雄的越南人民热爱和平与自由的意志，它获得了法国和全世界爱好和平人民的热烈拥护。
    越南人民反对帝国主义侵略、争取民族独立的胜利斗争，有力地加强了世界人民的和平民主事业。强大的世界和平力量，在赢得了朝鲜停战以后，为了争取国际局势的进一步缓和，更加关心地支持越南人民的正义斗争。今年十月间，世界工会第三次代表大会决定十二月十九日为“国际积极支援越南人民日与争取停止越南殖民战争斗争日”。十一月间，世界和平理事会维也纳会议所通过的总决议中，也指出应该通过谈判结束越南战争。中国人民正和全世界爱好和平人民一起，热烈响应这些号召，更积极地起来支持越南人民争取独立与和平的斗争，坚决制止帝国主义延长和扩大越南战争的阴谋。
    英勇的越南人民的抗战是一定要胜利的。正如胡志明主席在“告全国军民书”中所说的：“为了保卫民族独立和世界和平，我们军民一直在进行英勇的抗战，并且取得了许多重大的胜利。在我们人民的团结日益加强、法国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的积极支持日益增加的情况下，我们的抗战一定会取得胜利。”中国人民深信，为世界人民所支持的越南人民为越南民族独立、为世界和平而英勇斗争的伟大的正义事业一定会获得更大的和最后的胜利。
