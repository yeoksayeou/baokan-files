To the National United Front of Vietnam, to the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace, the Vietnam Youth League, the Vietnam Women's Union, and Cultural Circles:

    On the occasion of the seventh anniversary of the Vietnamese people's resistance war, on behalf of the entire Chinese people, we extend our deep condolences and pay our highest respect to you, the Vietnamese people, who are heroically fighting against the French colonialists for independence, freedom, and peace.

　　Over the past seven years, under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and President Ho Chi Minh, the heroic Vietnamese people have won glorious victories in the just struggle against the armed aggression of French imperialism. The Vietnamese people have achieved remarkable achievements in military, economic, political, and cultural fields, which are a strong guarantee for future victories in the struggle.

　　The continuous victories of the Vietnamese people have further weakened the imperialist camp and strengthened the world people's movement for peace and democracy. Even though the American imperialists, after the Korean armistice, have intensified their support for the French aggressors in an attempt to continue and expand the war of aggression against Vietnam, creating a tense situation in Asia, all the tricks of the French and American aggressors will suffer even greater defeats under the staunch struggle of the Vietnamese people and the opposition of the working class and peace-loving people around the world.

　　We, the entire Chinese people, resolutely support the Vietnamese people's struggle for national independence, freedom, and peace; warmly support President Ho Chi Minh's talk on the peaceful settlement of the Vietnam War published in the Swedish "Expressen" on November 26 this year, and firmly believe that final victory will surely belong to the Vietnamese people.

    中华全国总工会等团体给越南人民致敬电越南国民联合战线转越南总工会、越南保卫世界和平委员会、越南青年联盟、越南妇女联合会暨文化界：
    值此越南人民抗战七周年纪念日之际，谨代表中国全体人民向你们——为反对法国殖民者，争取独立、自由与和平而英勇斗争的越南人民——表示深切的慰问，并致以崇高的敬意。
　　七年来，英雄的越南人民在越南劳动党和胡志明主席领导下，在反对法帝国主义武装侵略的正义斗争中赢得了光辉的胜利，越南人民在军事、经济、政治、文化各方面都获得了显著的成就，成为今后斗争胜利的有力保证。
　　越南人民不断的胜利，进一步削弱了帝国主义阵营，加强了世界人民和平民主运动的力量。纵然美帝国主义者在朝鲜停战之后，又加紧支持法国侵略者妄图继续并扩大侵略越南的战争，制造亚洲的紧张局面，但是在越南人民坚强的斗争下，在全世界工人阶级和爱好和平的善良人们的反对下，法、美侵略者的一切伎俩定将遭到更大的失败。
　　我们中国全体人民坚决支持越南人民争取民族独立、自由与和平的斗争；热烈拥护胡志明主席今年十一月二十六日对瑞典“快报”发表的关于和平解决越南战争的谈话，并坚信最后胜利必然属于越南人民。
