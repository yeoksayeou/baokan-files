To prepare conditions for next year's production and construction, the Northwest Financial and Economic Committee convened an experience exchange meeting on planned management in early December. Forty-two units participated, including various industrial bureaus in the Northwest, major state-owned factories and mines, and local state-owned factories and mines near Xi'an. At the meeting, eight production and capital construction units, including Yumen Oil Mine, introduced their experiences.

Before the launch of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, by the end of August, the workload of state-owned industrial capital construction in the Northwest had only completed 55% of the annual plan, and the total value of industrial production had only completed 64.9% of the annual plan. After three months of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, it is estimated that by the end of November, the workload of capital construction will complete 90% of the annual plan, and it is estimated that it will complete more than 95% by the end of the year, which is better than the completion situation in previous years. In terms of production, the total value of products is expected to complete 92% by the end of November, and the annual plan can be overfulfilled. The typical speeches fully proved that the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement promoted enterprise management, first of all the strengthening of planned management, and the strengthening of planned management, especially the implementation of operational plans, ensured the completion of the tasks of increasing production and practicing economy. All factories and mines that can conscientiously combine increasing production and practicing economy with improving enterprise management have achieved significant results. For example, the capital construction project of the Northwest Third Cotton Textile Factory. Before the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, due to weak planned management and a lack of in-depth political work, the situation was very chaotic, the production enthusiasm of employees was low, and efficiency was very low. Bricklayers only laid two or three hundred bricks per day, and the leadership was also clueless and had no confidence in completing the task, repeatedly asking for a reduction. During the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, the chaotic situation was reversed by strengthening planned management, implementing operational plans, and strengthening political work, so that the leadership had a clear idea and the employees had clear and specific goals. Efficiency has been continuously improved, and bricklayers have improved their bricklaying to an average of more than 800 bricks, which not only ensures the completion of the original plan, but is also expected to exceed it. The Northwest Power Company's line engineering team also completed the Xi'an-Xianyang line project, which was originally considered impossible to complete on schedule, six days ahead of schedule due to the implementation of operational plans, thereby ensuring the power supply to the Xianyang industrial area. The first workshop of the Yumen Mining Bureau Refinery implemented shift operation plans and hourly output indicator charts during the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, and began to establish scheduling work, so that the plan could be completed evenly on a daily basis. The annual planned output of gasoline and kerosene has been completed one and a half months and two months ahead of schedule, respectively.

However, at present, the planned management of industrial and construction enterprises in the Northwest is generally not sound and detailed enough. Operational plans are only beginning to be implemented, and business departments and auxiliary departments have not been able to cooperate closely, so the balance and comprehensiveness of completing the plan are still poor. Generally, enterprises can complete the plan on average on a monthly basis, but they cannot complete it evenly on a ten-day, daily, or shift basis; the output is completed better, while the completion of other plans is poorer. At the same time, the combination of planned management to drive technical management and the establishment of a responsibility system is not enough, so the phenomenon of low product and project quality is still widespread.

Therefore, the meeting finally requested that all units, based on the experience of advanced units and in combination with the specific situation of their own units, conduct research, formulate specific work steps for improving enterprise management in the first quarter of next year, and make preparations to create conditions for production and construction in 1954.

    为明年工业生产和基本建设准备条件
    西北举行计划管理经验交流会议
    为了给明年生产建设准备条件，西北财政经济委员会在十二月初召开了计划管理经验交流会议。西北各工业局、主要国营厂矿及西安附近地方国营厂矿共四十二个单位参加了会议。会上由玉门油矿等八个生产及基本建设单位作了经验介绍。
    增产节约运动开展前，至八月底西北国营工业基本建设工作量仅完成年计划的百分之五十五，工业生产总值只完成年计划的百分之六十四点九。经过三个月来的增产节约运动，至十一月底预计基本建设工作量可完成年计划百分之九十，至年底预计可完成百分之九十五以上，比历年完成情况都好；生产方面产品总值至十一月底预计可完成百分之九十二，全年计划可超额完成。从几个典型发言中充分证明，增产节约运动促进了企业经营管理，首先是计划管理的加强，而计划管理的加强，特别是作业计划的推行，又保证了增产节约任务的完成。凡能认真把增产节约与改善企业管理相结合的厂矿，都获得了显著成绩。如国营西北第三棉纺织厂基本建设工程，增产节约前，由于计划管理薄弱和缺乏深入的政治工作，情况很混乱，职工生产情绪低落，效率很低，瓦工每天只砌二、三百块砖，领导上也心中无数，对完成任务没有信心，一再要求减少。在增产节约运动中，通过加强计划管理，推行了作业计划，并加强了政治工作，扭转了混乱情况，使领导心中有数，职工也有了明确具体的行动目标，效率不断提高，瓦工砌砖平均提高到八百多块，不但保证了原订计划的完成，预计还可超过。西北火电公司线路工程队也由于推行了作业计划，使原来认为不能按期完成的西安咸阳线路工程提前六天完成，从而保证了咸阳工业地区的用电。玉门矿务局炼油厂第一车间在增产节约运动中，推行了班作业计划和小时产量指示图表，并开始建立了调度工作，使计划能按日均衡地完成，汽油、煤油年计划产量已提前一个半月及两个月完成。
    但目前西北工业、建筑企业计划管理工作一般仍不够健全和细致，作业计划还只是开始推行，业务科室及辅助部门还未能紧密配合，因而完成计划的均衡性和全面性还较差。一般企业虽能按月平均完成计划，但还不能按旬、日、班均衡地完成；产量完成较好而其他计划完成较差。同时，结合计划管理带动技术管理及责任制的建立也还不够，因而产品及工程质量不高的现象仍普遍存在。
    因此，会议最后要求各单位根据先进单位的经验，结合本单位具体情况，进行研究，拟订出明年第一季度改进企业管理的具体工作步骤，并作好准备工作，为一九五四年生产建设创造条件。
