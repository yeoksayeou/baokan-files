    Vietnam People's Army Headquarters Issues Communiqué on the Liberation of Lai Châu Provincial Capital
    Vietnam News Agency Points Out Liberation of Lai Châu is a Major Victory for the Vietnamese People
    [Xinhua News Agency dispatch] Hanoi, December 15th: The General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army issued a communiqué on December 12th regarding the liberation of Lai Châu provincial capital, stating: On the morning of December 11th at 8:00 AM, advance units of the Vietnam People's Army entered Lai Châu provincial capital. Under severe threat from the People's Army, the enemy had no choice but to evacuate a portion of its garrison troops from Lai Châu by air; the remaining approximately two thousand enemy troops are fleeing along the mountain road between Lai Châu and Điện Biên Phủ, and the People's Army is immediately pursuing them. On the night of the 11th, the People's Army caught up with the last group of enemy troops fleeing Lai Châu, and fighting is currently underway.
  [Xinhua News Agency dispatch, December 16th] The Vietnam News Agency published on December 15th a commentary by military commentator Zheng Yi titled "Cheer the Liberation of Lai Châu".

    The commentary stated: Lai Châu, the provincial capital of Lai Châu province, was liberated from the enemy's clutches on December 11th. For the first time since the French colonialists invaded Vietnam, the Vietnam People's Army has met with the people of Lai Châu, and the flag of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is flying over this city for the first time.

    The commentary continued: During their occupation of Lai Châu, the French aggressors brutally oppressed and exploited ethnic minorities such as the Thai people. In order to realize their vicious "divide and rule" conspiracy, the French aggressors incited the Thai people to attack the residents of the Red River Delta on the one hand, and created ethnic strife within the Thai community on the other, causing the White Thai and Black Thai to kill each other.

    The commentary pointed out: Lai Châu, an important strategic stronghold in the Northwest region of Vietnam, was turned by the enemy into an area from which they could shield their strongholds in northern Laos to the southwest, attack Sơn La to the southeast, attack Lào Cai to the northeast, and support the activities of armed bandits they had placed in areas along the Chinese border for hundreds of kilometers.

    Due to the importance of Lai Châu, the enemy turned Lai Châu into a military zone and spared no effort to consolidate it over the past eighty years. After the French colonialists were defeated by the Japanese fascists in World War II, they withdrew their remaining troops to Lai Châu and Phongsaly in northern Laos, and then fled to Yunnan, which was then under the rule of Chiang Kai-shek. In 1946, the remaining French troops colluded with the Chinese Kuomintang reactionaries and returned to Lai Châu and Phongsaly, from where they attacked the Northwest region of Vietnam and Sam Neua in Laos.

    During the autumn-winter offensive launched by the Vietnam People's Army in 1952, the French aggressors suffered a disastrous defeat in the Northwest region of Vietnam, but they stubbornly held on to Lai Châu provincial capital, attempting to reoccupy the Northwest region.

    Navarre, the Commander-in-Chief of the French invasion forces in Indochina, and Cogny, the Commander of French forces in North Vietnam, recently, in order to cover up their defeats, insisted that Lai Châu had lost its political and military importance, just as the French aggressors, when repeatedly forced to abandon Cao Bằng, Lạng Sơn, Hòa Bình, and Nà Sản, also said that these places had lost their military and political importance. But the enemy's lying propaganda only exposed their disastrous defeat.

    The commentary concluded: The liberation of Lai Châu is a major military and political victory for the Vietnamese people, and at the same time a serious defeat for foreign aggressors. The people of the Northwest region of Vietnam and the people of the whole country are cheering the news of the liberation of Lai Châu.

    越南人民军总部发布解放莱州省会的公报
    越南通讯社指出莱州的解放是越南人民的重大胜利
    【新华社讯】据越南通讯社十五日讯：越南人民军总司令部在十二月十二日发布解放莱州省会的公报说：十二月十一日上午八时，越南人民军先头部队进入莱州省会。敌军在受到人民军严重威胁的情况下，不得不先把一部分守军用飞机从莱州撤走；余下的二千名左右的敌军正沿着莱州和奠边府之间的山路逃窜，人民军立刻跟踪追击。在十一日晚上，人民军追上了最后逃出莱州的一批敌军，现战斗正在进行中。
  【新华社十六日讯】越南通讯社十五日发表军事评论员政义一篇题为“欢呼莱州解放”的评论。
    评论说：莱州省省会——莱州在十一日从敌人的魔掌下解放出来了。自从法国殖民者入侵越南以来，越南人民军第一次和莱州人民会见，越南民主共和国的国旗第一次飘扬在这个城市的上空。
    评论接着说：法国侵略者在占领莱州期间，残酷地压迫和剥削泰族等少数民族。为了实现恶毒的“分治”阴谋，法国侵略者一面唆使泰族去攻击红河三角洲的居民，一面在泰族内部制造民族纠纷，使白泰族和黑泰族自相残杀。
    评论指出：越南西北地区的重镇莱州是一个重要的战略据点，它曾被敌人变成这样一个区域：向西南可以掩护他们在寮国北部的据点，向东南可以进攻山萝，向东北可以进攻老街，并可以支持他们安置在沿中国边境几百公里地区的武装匪徒的活动。
    由于莱州的重要性，在过去八十多年中，敌人把莱州变成了一个军事地区，并且竭力巩固这个地区。法国殖民者在第二次世界大战中被日本法西斯击败后，就把他们的残余部队撤退到莱州和寮国北部的封萨里，其后又逃往当时在蒋介石统治下的云南。一九四六年，法国残余部队和中国国民党反动派勾结，回到了莱州和封萨里，并从这两个地方进攻越南西北地区和寮国的桑怒。
    在一九五二年越南人民军发动秋冬攻势期间，法国侵略者在越南西北地区遭到惨败，但他们仍然死守着莱州省省会，企图重新占领西北地区。
    印度支那法国侵略军总司令纳瓦尔和侵越法军北越总司令戈涅，最近为了掩饰他们的败绩，硬说莱州已失去了它的政治和军事重要性，这正如当法国侵略者接连被迫放弃高平、谅山、和平与那产时，也说这些地方已失去了军事和政治重要性一样。但敌人的撒谎宣传只暴露了他们的惨败。
    评论最后说：莱州的解放是越南人民的一个重大的军事和政治胜利，同时是外国侵略者的一个严重的失败。越南西北地区的人民和全国人民都为莱州解放的消息而欢呼。
