On the Principle of Material Interests Under the Socialist System
Academician A. Pashkov of the USSR Academy of Sciences

The issue of the material interests of workers in the fruits of their labor has always been of great significance for the development of social production. The extent of workers' material interests directly and indirectly affects the increase in labor productivity. The issue of incentives invariably arises in every socio-economic structure, and every ruling class seeks to solve this problem according to objective economic conditions. However, in any society based on the exploitation of man by man, the problem of workers' material interests in developing production cannot be truly solved, because the vast majority of the products produced are seized by the exploiters.

Bourgeois ideologues constantly claim that capitalism, along with its private ownership, seems to guarantee the material interests of every citizen in developing production.

In order to deceive the workers, capitalists implement various cunning wage systems to create the impression that the material welfare of the working class depends on its labor productivity and on the achievements of the capitalist economy.

In reality, the result of developing capitalist production and increasing workers' labor productivity can only enrich a small group of capitalists, while bankrupting and impoverishing the working people. Therefore, capitalist economic relations cannot create conditions for workers' material interests in developing and improving capitalist production.

Only socialism can truly guarantee the continuous improvement of workers' material interests in social production and turn this interest into the most important economic stimulus for the development of the national economy.

In our society, the material interests of workers in developing the entire social production are determined by the very essence of the socialist system, and it stems from the fundamental economic law of socialism.

Under the socialist system, people do not labor for exploiters, but for themselves and for society. The public ownership of the means of production is the foundation for the unity of interests of all the people, various classes, and social strata of the Soviet Union, and it is the foundation for the unity of individual interests and social interests. Under socialist conditions, increasing social wealth is the material foundation for improving the welfare and cultural level of every worker.

In a socialist society, the entire social product (excluding the replenishment of necessary means of production) is divided into two parts: one part is for individuals, and the other is for society. The first part is distributed among workers in the sphere of material production according to the quantity and quality of their labor, and it is used for the needs of the workers themselves and their families. The second part is used for expanding the socialist economy, healthcare, education, social insurance, etc., which is used to improve the material and cultural level of the working people. Therefore, every worker in a socialist society is closely concerned with striving to improve both of these parts of the total social product.

Workers having their individual material interests in expanding production is one of the fundamental principles of socialist management (whether it is the state-owned economic component of socialist production or the cooperative collective farm economic component). Lenin pointed out: "Do not directly rely on enthusiasm, but by means of the enthusiasm engendered by the great revolution, on personal interest, on personal incentive, and on business principles, endeavor first to build solid small bridges leading…via state capitalism to socialism; otherwise you will never arrive at communism, you will never bring scores of millions of people to communism." (Lenin, Collected Works, Vol. 33, p. 36) Strictly implementing this principle is objectively essential, and if this principle is violated, it will hinder the improvement of socialist production and the improvement of the welfare of the Soviet people.

Of course, under the socialist system, people's conscious attitude towards labor and their understanding of the necessity of labor for the overall interest are playing an increasing role. However, no matter how significant these new, communist incentives are, they cannot replace material incentives, which play a very important role in developing production in the first stage of communist society.

Workers' material interests in expanding production and increasing their income are the great advantages of the socialist economic system over the capitalist economic system. Being good at widely using this principle can increase workers' enthusiasm to improve technology, make the most rational use of production tools, raw materials, and materials, and improve their skills and labor productivity.

The material interests of workers are realized through the thorough implementation of the socialist principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work." This principle can correctly combine the individual interests of workers with the interests of developing social production. In a socialist society, the more effective the labor of each worker is and the better the quality of the product is, the greater the material interests he will obtain. On the other hand, the higher the labor productivity of workers is, the faster the socialist production will develop, and the greater the possibility of satisfying the ever-growing needs of the whole society.

The Party and the government constantly oppose the petty-bourgeois manifestations of egalitarianism in labor remuneration and strive to increase the material interests of workers in various sectors of the national economy.

In the state production sector, the economic law of distribution according to work is embodied in the form of wages, and the level of wages is based on the skill level of a staff member and his labor productivity, the role of each economic sector, and the increase in the entire social wealth. In increasing labor productivity, the effect of material encouragement is directly related to the degree of implementation of piece-rate wages and improvement of labor standards, and to the widespread promotion of advanced quotas.

The principle of material interests is one of the basic elements of economic accounting. Economic accounting shows that the better an enterprise completes the quantitative and qualitative indicators of the state plan, the more likely this enterprise will be to materially encourage its staff.

In the collective farm production sector, the work-day is the form of distributing income and the main lever for increasing the material interests of collective farmers in developing the public economy.

As an economic type, the work-day embodies the socialist principle of labor remuneration in the collective farm economy. It is a measure of the labor and consumption of collective farmers, and it is a method of increasing their enthusiasm in developing the collective farm economy.

In order to improve the material encouragement measures for collective farmers, advanced collective farms are constantly improving labor organization, adopting advanced work quotas, and implementing the established system of giving collective farmers extra labor remuneration for increasing the yield per unit area of agriculture and the productivity of livestock products. For example, the Stalin Collective Farm in Vurnal District, Chuvash Autonomous Republic, strictly implements the system of giving extra remuneration to collective farmers who overfulfill the plan for unit area yield and the development of animal husbandry. As a result, the production of agricultural products in the collective farm is increasing year by year. If the average yield of spring wheat per hectare was 14 quintals in 1944-1946, then it was 27.8 quintals in 1947-1949, and in 1950-1952, the yield per hectare reached 35.3 quintals.

With the improvement of social production, the material welfare of collective farmers is also continuously improving. In the past seven years, the Stalin Collective Farm averaged more than four kilograms of grain, three kilograms of vegetables, five kilograms of feed, and two rubles and fifty kopecks in cash per work-day.

The planned development of the national economy makes it possible to implement the principle of material interests in all areas of socialist production. However, as pointed out in the resolution of the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the principle of material interests has been violated in some agricultural sectors. Everyone knows that the production of cotton, sugar beet, tea, and citrus crops has been well encouraged. However, economic encouragement for animal husbandry and the production of potatoes and vegetables is still far from adequate, and this is one of the fundamental reasons for the backwardness of these sectors.

Insufficient material encouragement is primarily manifested in the fact that the purchase and procurement prices of animal products and potatoes and vegetables were still very low until recently.

The standards for purchase and procurement prices are stipulated by the state based on the requirements of socialist economic laws. The level of purchase prices should, on the one hand, guarantee the material interests of collective farms and collective farmers in product production, and on the other hand, guarantee that a part of the net income of collective farms is absorbed into the centralized state fund (i.e., the state budget) to meet the needs of the whole society, to develop socialist production (including the development of those sectors that supply agriculture with machinery and fertilizers), and to meet the needs of education, healthcare, and national defense.

In order to increase the material interests of collective farms and collective farmers, the purchase prices of animal products and potatoes and vegetables have now been greatly increased.

Selling animal products and potatoes and vegetables to the state is one of the main sources of cash income for collective farms and the personal income of collective farmers. Due to the increase in the above-mentioned prices, the material interests of collective farmers in developing the public economy have also increased, and conditions have been created for eliminating backward phenomena in some agricultural production sectors.

In some states and regions, the principle of stipulated obligatory sales quotas calculated per hectare has been violated, which contradicts the principle that collective farms and collective farmers have their material interests in developing production. The Party and the government have criticized this bad phenomenon and instructed that the principle of calculation per hectare must be strictly observed in the future.

The state's purchase of surplus grain, meat, potatoes, vegetables, milk, and other agricultural products from collective farms at prices higher than the purchase prices will also have extremely important encouragement effects.

Marxism-Leninism regards the collective farm's public economy as the decisive force for improving the material welfare of collective farmers. It also teaches us that during the socialist period, the private sideline occupations of collective farmers play a significant role in meeting their material needs. Everyone knows that the private sideline occupations of collective farmers are often ignored until now, which causes losses to collective farmers and the entire society. The Party and the government have criticized these deviations and passed some decisions to eliminate this phenomenon, such as: revising the system of collecting agricultural taxes from collective farmers, reducing the cash tax for each collective farm household, etc.

Thoroughly implementing the principle of material interests has great significance in developing collective farm production. At the same time, improving the technical equipment of machine tractor stations and state farms, increasing the degree of mechanization of animal husbandry and vegetable and potato cultivation, strengthening collective farms organizationally and economically, and improving the leadership of collective farms will all become the basis for further vigorous development of agriculture.

The resolutions recently passed by the Party and the government on developing agriculture, increasing the production of consumer goods, and developing Soviet trade will greatly increase the material interests of the Soviet people in developing socialist production. (Xinhua News Agency)

    论社会主义制度下物质利益的原则
    苏联科学院通讯院士  阿·帕什科夫
    劳动者在其劳动成果中的物质利益的问题，对发展社会生产一直具有重要的意义。劳动者物质利益的大小，直接和间接地影响着劳动生产率的提高。刺激的问题在每种社会经济结构中无论如何总是要发生的，而每一个统治阶级都设法根据客观经济条件去解决这个问题。但是，在任何一个以人剥削人为基础的社会中，都无法真正解决劳动者在发展生产中的物质利益这个问题，因为极大部分生产出来的产品都被剥削者攫取了。
    资产阶级的思想家喋喋不休地说什么资本主义连同其私有制似乎能保证社会上每个公民在发展生产中的物质利益。
    为了欺骗工人，资本家实行各种狡猾的工资制度，以造成一种印象，似乎工人阶级的物质福利要依赖于它的劳动生产率，依赖于资本主义经济的成就。
    实际上，发展资本主义生产，提高工人的劳动生产率的结果，只能使一小撮资本家致富，而使劳动人民破产和贫困。因此，资本主义的经济关系不能为工人在发展和改善资本主义生产中的物质利益创造条件。
    只有社会主义才能真正保证劳动者不断改善社会生产中的物质利益，才能把这种利益变成发展国民经济的最重要的经济刺激因素。
    在我们的社会中，劳动者在发展整个社会生产中的物质利益是由社会主义制度的本质本身所决定了的，它是从社会主义基本经济法则出发的。
    在社会主义制度下，人们不是为剥削者劳动，而是为自己、为社会劳动。生产资料公有制是苏联全体人民、各个阶级和社会阶层利益一致的基础，是个人利益和社会利益一致的基础。在社会主义条件下，提高每个劳动者的福利和文化水平的物质基础，就是增加社会财富。
    在社会主义社会中，全部社会产品（除去补充必需的生产资料以外）分为两部分：一部分产品是为了个人，一部分是为了社会。第一部分是劳动者在物质生产范围内根据他们的劳动数量和质量来进行分配，用作劳动者个人及其家庭的需要。第二部分是用在扩大社会主义经济、保健、教育、社会保险等等方面，也就是用来提高劳动人民的物质和文化水平。因此，社会主义社会的每个劳动者，都密切地关心尽力提高全部社会产品的这两个部分。
    在发展生产中，劳动者有其个人的物质利益，这是社会主义经营（无论是社会主义生产的国家经济成分还是合作社集体农庄经济成分）的根本原则之一。列宁指出：“你们不是直接依靠热忱，而借助于大革命所产生的热忱，依据个人的兴趣，依据个人利益，依据经济核算制来首先努力建造导向……社会主义的坚固的桥梁；否则你们就达不到共产主义，否则你们就不能把千万人民引导到共产主义。”（列宁全集第三十三卷，第三六页）严格地实行这一原则，在客观上是必不可少的，如果破坏了这一原则，就会妨碍社会主义生产的提高和苏联人民福利的提高。
    当然，在社会主义制度下，人们对劳动的自觉的态度以及他们理解到劳动对整体利益的必要性，是起着日益增长的作用的。但是，无论这种新的、共产主义的刺激的意义是多么的大，它总不能代替物质的刺激，这种刺激在共产主义社会第一阶段对发展生产具有极重大的作用。
    劳动者在扩大生产量和增加他的收入中的物质利益，是社会主义经济制度较之资本主义经济制度具有的巨大优点。善于广泛地运用这一原则，就可以提高劳动者的积极性，来改善技术、最合理地使用生产工具、原料和材料，提高他们的熟练程度和劳动生产率。
    劳动者的物质利益，是通过彻底实行“各尽所能，按劳取酬”这一社会主义原则来实现的。这一原则可以正确地把劳动者的个人利益和发展社会生产的利益结合在一起。在社会主义社会中，每个劳动者的劳动愈有成效，生产品的质量愈好，他所获得的物质利益也就愈大。另一方面，劳动者的劳动生产率愈高，则社会主义生产发展的速度也就愈快，满足全社会不断增长的需要的可能性也就愈大。
    党和政府经常不断地反对小资产阶级在劳动报酬上的平均主义的表现，竭力提高国民经济各部门中劳动者的物质利益。
    在国家生产部门中，按劳分配的经济法则以工资形式体现出来，工资的高低是依据一个工作人员的熟练程度和他的劳动生产率，依据各该经济部门的作用，依据整个社会财富的增加。在提高劳动生产率方面，物质鼓励的效果是与实行计件工资和改进劳动标准的程度，与广泛地推行先进的定额有直接的关系的。
    物质利益的原则，是经济核算制的基本因素之一。经济核算制说明，一个企业完成国家计划的数量指标和质量指标愈好，那末这个企业也就愈有可能在物质上鼓励自己的工作人员。
    在集体农庄生产部门中，劳动日就是分配收入的形式和提高集体农民对发展公有经济的物质利益的主要杠杆。
    作为一种经济类型的劳动日，体现了集体农庄经济中劳动报酬的社会主义原则，它是衡量集体农民劳动和消费的尺度，是提高他们在发展集体农庄经济中的积极性的方法。
    为了改善对集体农民的物质鼓励办法，先进的集体农庄在不断地改进劳动组织，采用先进的工作定额，贯彻实行因提高农业单位面积产量和牲畜的产品生产率而给予集体农民以额外劳动报酬这一既定的制度。例如，楚瓦西自治共和国伍尔纳尔区斯大林集体农庄，就严格地实行了给超额完成单位面积产量和饲畜业发展计划的集体农民以额外报酬的制度。结果该集体农庄农产品的生产量年年都在增加。如果一九四四—一九四六年每公顷春小麦的平均收获量是十四公担，那末一九四七—一九四九年就收了二十七点八公担，而在一九五○—一九五二年，每公顷的收获量就达到三十五点三公担。
    随着社会生产的提高，集体农民的物质福利也不断地提高。在最近七年中，斯大林集体农庄平均每个劳动日可得四公斤多谷物，三公斤的蔬菜，五公斤的饲料和两卢布五十戈比的现款。
    国民经济有计划的发展，使得在社会主义生产各个范围内可以贯彻实行物质利益的原则。然而，正如苏联共产党中央委员会九月全体会议的决议中所指出的，在某些农业部门中物质利益的原则被破坏了。大家知道，棉花、甜菜、茶叶、柑橘类作物的生产，已得到很好的鼓励。但是，对饲畜业以及马铃薯和蔬菜生产的经济鼓励直到现在还远远作得不够，这也是这些部门落后的基本原因之一。
    物质鼓励不够，这首先表现为畜产品以及马铃薯和蔬菜的征购和收购价格直到最近还很低。
    征购和收购价格的标准是由国家依据社会主义经济法则的要求规定的。征购价格的水平一方面应该保证集体农庄和集体农民在产品生产中的物质利益，另一方面应该保证把集体农庄的一部分纯收入吸收入集中的国家基金（即国家预算）中，用来满足整个社会的需要，用来发展社会主义生产（其中包括发展以机器、肥料供应农业的那些部门），并用来满足教育、保健和国防的需要。
    为了增加集体农庄和集体农民的物质利益，现在已大大提高了畜产品以及马铃薯和蔬菜的征购价格。
    把畜产品以及马铃薯和蔬菜交售给国家，是集体农庄的现金收入和集体农民个人收入的主要来源之一。由于上述的价格的提高，集体农民在发展公有经济中的物质利益也增加了，并造成了消灭一些农业生产部门中落后现象的条件。
    在一些州和区，破坏了规定的按每公顷计算义务交售定额的原则，这就与集体农庄和集体农民在发展生产中有其物质利益这一原则发生了抵触。党和政府已指责了这种不好的现象，并指令今后要严格遵守按每公顷计算的原则。
    国家以比征购价格较高的价格向集体农庄收购剩余谷物、肉类、马铃薯、蔬菜、牛奶和其他农产品，这也将有极其重大的鼓励作用。
    马克思列宁主义把集体农庄的公有经济看成是提高集体农民物质福利的有决定意义的力量，它同时教导我们说，在社会主义时期，集体农民的私人副业对满足他们的物质需求有着重大的作用。大家知道，直到现在还往往忽视集体农民的私人副业，这就给集体农民和整个社会造成了损失。党和政府已指责了这些偏差，并通过一些消灭这种现象的决定，如：修改了向集体农民征收农业税的制度，降低了每一集体农庄农户的现金税等等。
    彻底实行物质利益的原则，在发展集体农庄生产方面有重大的意义。同时，提高机器拖拉机站和国营农场的技术设备，提高饲畜业和种植蔬菜、马铃薯的工作的机械化程度，在组织上和经济上加强集体农庄并改进对集体农庄的领导，这一切都将成为进一步大力发展农业的基础。
    党和政府最近通过的关于发展农业、增加消费品的生产、发展苏联贸易的一些决议，将更加大大地提高苏联人民在发展社会主义生产中的物质利益。（新华社）
