    Shandong farmers are actively engaged in winter production, preparing conditions for a bumper grain harvest next year. Inspired by the general line for the transition period, farmers' enthusiasm for production is higher than in any previous year. They say, "Production is even more energetic after hearing the propaganda about the general line." During winter plowing, farmers proposed "the land doesn't freeze, the plow doesn't stop," and the province's winter plowing area has reached 80% of the area that should be plowed. In the Dezhou area, 90% to 95% has been plowed. In the Jiaozhou area, many villages have plowed 100%. Shandong farmers have also been more diligent in weeding wheat, watering wheat, and applying topdressing this year. Ningyang County, which previously had no habit of weeding wheat, weeded 320,000 mu this year, accounting for 70% of the county's total wheat area. In Shouzhang County, 40% of farmers have applied topdressing to their wheat fields. In Zhangjiazhuang, 90 households in this county bought more than 100,000 jin of manure from other places to apply topdressing to their wheat fields. Many farmers are actively building water conservancy projects, adding livestock, and agricultural tools. 300,000 farmers in the Jiaozhou area participated in water conservancy construction work. Of the 28 water conservancy projects originally planned to be built in the area this winter, 20 have now been completed, benefiting more than 100,000 mu of land. Farmers in the 15th district of Shouzhang County pooled shares to buy 90 horses from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
    The general line has further inspired farmers to actively participate in mutual aid and cooperative organizations. Many farmers who previously wanted to withdraw from mutual aid teams and cooperatives now say they are determined not to withdraw; those who have already withdrawn are asking to rejoin. In Yidu County, 150 mutual aid teams are considering piloting agricultural production cooperatives; Ningyang County has restored and developed 152 mutual aid teams, and 440 farmers have applied to organize agricultural production cooperatives, of which 25 are ready to meet all the necessary conditions for establishing agricultural production cooperatives.

    山东农民积极参加互助合作进行冬季生产
    山东省农民正积极进行冬季生产，为明年粮食丰收准备条件。在国家过渡时期总路线的鼓舞下，农民生产情绪比以往任何一年都高。他们说：“听了总路线的宣传生产更有劲了。”冬耕时农民提出“地不冻、犁不停”，全省冬耕面积已达应耕面积的百分之八十。德州专区已耕到百分之九十到九十五。胶州专区很多乡耕到百分之百。山东农民今年锄麦、浇麦、施追肥也比较普遍，过去没有锄麦习惯的宁阳县，今年锄了三十二万亩，占全县小麦总面积百分之七十。寿张县往麦地里施追肥的农户已达百分之四十。该县张家庄九十户农民为了往麦地里上追肥，曾到别处买大粪十余万斤。许多农民积极兴办水利、添买牲畜、农具。胶州专区农民三十万人参加了兴修水利的工作。该专区原来计划今年冬天兴办的二十八项水利工程，现已完成二十项，将受益的土地有十万多亩。寿张县十五区农民集股到蒙古自治区买马九十匹。
    总路线更鼓舞着农民积极参加互助合作组织，许多过去想退组退社的农民现在表示坚决不退了；已经退出的又要求重新加入。益都县有一百五十个互助组酝酿试办农业生产合作社；宁阳县已恢复和发展了一百五十二个互助组，并有四百四十个农户申请组织农业生产合作社，其中已有二十五处准备好了成立农业生产合作社的一切必要条件。
