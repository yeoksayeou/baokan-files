    Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Region First Session of the First People's Representative Conference of All Ethnic Groups
    Telegram of Respect to Chairman Mao
    Respected Chairman Mao:
    We report to you with boundless joy that the People's Government of the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Region was formally established on December 15th. Representatives of all ethnic groups in our Hainan Tibetan Region gathered together to discuss and decide on their own important matters.
    In the past four years, under the glorious illumination of your ethnic policies, the people of all ethnic groups in our region have united unprecedentedly. A new atmosphere of "prosperity for both people and livestock" has emerged in the vast pastoral areas. The number of our various livestock has increased by an average of over 70 percent compared to the time of liberation. Four hundred and twenty-five minority ethnic cadres throughout the region have participated in work. On the vast grasslands, tent schools have appeared, and the children of herdsmen have begun to receive educational opportunities. All these benefits of ours have been obtained under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and you.
    As our motherland is undergoing large-scale economic construction, we must strive to develop animal husbandry and agricultural production and use this practical action to support and cooperate with the motherland's economic construction. We believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the higher-level people's government, as long as we further strengthen and consolidate the unity between and within our various ethnic groups and give full play to the initiative of being "masters of our own affairs," we will surely build the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Region into a more prosperous and happy place, and contribute our strength to the construction of our great motherland.
    Finally, we, on behalf of the people of all ethnic groups in the Hainan Tibetan Region, extend our highest respect to you and wish you eternal health.

    海南藏族自治区首届第一次各族各界人民代表会议
    向毛主席致敬电敬爱的毛主席：
    我们怀着无限欢欣的心情向您报告，海南藏族自治区人民政府已在十二月十五日正式成立。我们海南藏区各族人民的代表欢聚在一堂，商量和决定了自己的大事。
    四年来，在您的民族政策光辉照耀下，我们全区各族人民已空前地团结起来了。在广大的牧业区出现了“人畜两旺”的新气象。我们的各种牲畜平均比解放时增殖了百分之七十以上。全区已有四百二十五个少数民族干部参加了工作。在辽阔的草原上，出现了帐房小学，牧民的孩子们开始得到了受教育的机会。我们的这些好处都是在中国共产党和您的英明领导下获得的。
    当我们祖国正在进行大规模的经济建设时期，我们一定要努力发展畜牧业和农业生产，用这个实际行动来支援和配合祖国的经济建设。我们相信：在中国共产党和上级人民政府的领导下，只要我们更进一步地加强和巩固我们各民族间和各民族内部的团结，充分发挥“当家作主”的积极性，我们一定会把海南藏族自治区建设得更加繁荣和幸福，并在建设我们伟大的祖国中，尽到我们的力量。
    最后，我们谨代表海南藏区各族人民，向您致崇高的敬意，并祝福您永远健康。
