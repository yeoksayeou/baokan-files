Xinhua News Agency, December 29th: The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic League, the China Democratic National Construction Association, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, the China Zhi Gong Party, the Jiusan Society, and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce have recently instructed their respective local organizations at all levels to mobilize members to promote the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds and actively subscribe to them.

The Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang issued a notice on the 21st, requesting its local organizations in provinces and cities to carry out various appropriate forms of propaganda activities under the unified leadership of the local Communist Party committees, people's governments, and bond promotion committees; and to mobilize and urge members to actively participate in propaganda activities under the unified leadership of the Party and government in their respective units. Organizations at all levels should encourage their members to display patriotic enthusiasm, actively respond to the call of the state, subscribe enthusiastically according to their ability, and play a positive role among the masses they are in contact with.

The Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League issued instructions on the 15th, calling on all levels of the League's organizations and all its members to vigorously publicize the significance of issuing public bonds, assist relevant authorities in doing a good job in promotion, and actively mobilize members to subscribe to public bonds. At the same time, it required all League members to recognize that the issuance of the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds is one of the methods for raising the funds needed for the country's socialist industrialization. It turns the savings and potentially saved funds in the hands of the people into useful funds for national construction, which not only promotes the people's patriotism but also encourages savings.

The General Association of the China Democratic National Construction Association issued a notice on the 16th, requiring all members to play an exemplary and leading role in the work of subscribing to and promoting public bonds this time, and to express their sincere support for the country's general line with practical actions. The notice said: In addition to contacting the relevant local departments immediately to send appropriate personnel to participate in the public bond promotion committee, the leadership at all levels of the CDNCA should also study specific methods of organization and mobilization to ensure that all members, in addition to enthusiastically subscribing to public bonds, can also do a good job in publicizing and promoting public bonds under the organization and leadership. The notice also said: Since the amount of public bonds issued this time is not large and the distribution is reasonable, people of all strata are able to afford it. The government has also taken care of those who cannot afford to buy them, stipulating that they must not be forced to buy them. Therefore, it is certain that the task of issuing public bonds this time can be successfully completed. In the past, the business community generally performed well in subscribing to the People's Victory Inflation-Adjusted Bonds. This time, it is believed that they will respond to the government's call with positive actions and complete or even over fulfill the glorious task of purchasing bonds.

In a notice on the 16th, the headquarters of the China Association for Promoting Democracy required organizations at all levels and all members to subscribe enthusiastically and carry out publicity work to the masses they are in contact with. The notice said that the lives of the people across the country have been improving day by day and their political awareness has been greatly enhanced under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China for the past four years, and they are fully capable of completing the task of subscription.

The Central Executive Bureau of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party issued instructions on the 15th, instructing organizations at all levels to earnestly carry out study, propaganda, and promotion work in order to launch a wave of subscription to public bonds among members and the masses they are in contact with. The instructions pointed out that the people's purchase of public bonds, on the one hand, supports the country's economic construction, and on the other hand, can recover interest and principal on time, and increasingly share the fruits of national construction.

The Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party issued instructions on the 28th, requiring organizations and members at all levels to study relevant documents, vigorously publicize the great significance of issuing public bonds, and deeply understand, as stated in the State Council's instructions, that subscribing to public bonds "is not only one of the important and regular methods of raising funds needed for socialist industrialization economically, but also a manifestation of patriotism politically."

The Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society issued instructions on the 27th, stating that subscribing to national economic construction bonds is a sincere expression of our love for the motherland and a concrete action to support national industrialization, and it is a glorious obligation that everyone should fulfill to the country. The instructions called on members to subscribe enthusiastically to public bonds and play a leading role among the masses.

The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce issued instructions on the 25th, requiring local federations of industry and commerce or preparatory committees to, under the leadership of the local Communist Party and people's government, combine the propaganda of the country's general line and general tasks, and use various gatherings and various methods to earnestly do a good job in the propaganda and mobilization work for the issuance of construction bonds this time. The instructions also pointed out that not only have industrialists and businessmen across the country had surpluses in the past four years; and because of the leadership and education of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government, their political awareness has also been improved, especially after studying the country's general line and general tasks, the political understanding of industrialists and businessmen across the country has been further enhanced. Therefore, the promotion work of construction bonds this time should and can be successfully completed among the industrial and commercial circles.

    各民主党派和全国工商联指示各级组织
    积极发动成员推销和认购公债
    【新华社二十九日讯】中国国民党革命委员会，中国民主同盟，中国民主建国会，中国民主促进会，中国农工民主党，中国致公党和九三学社以及中华全国工商业联合会，最近分别指示所属各级地方组织发动成员做好关于一九五四年国家经济建设公债的宣传工作，并积极认购公债。
    中国国民党革命委员会中央委员会于二十一日发出通知，要求它的在省市的地方组织，在当地中共党委、人民政府和公债推销委员会的统一领导下，进行各种适当形式的宣传活动；并动员、督促成员在其所属单位党、政的统一领导下，积极参加宣传活动。各级组织应鼓励所属成员发挥爱国主义热情，积极响应国家的号召，按照自己的力量，踊跃认购，并在所联系的群众中起积极作用。
    中国民主同盟中央常务委员会于十五日发出指示，号召民盟各级组织和全体盟员大力宣传发行公债的意义，协助有关机关作好推销工作和积极动员成员认购公债。同时，要求全体盟员认识发行一九五四年国家经济建设公债是筹集国家社会主义工业化所需资金的方法之一。以人民手中的积余和可能节约的资金，集腋成裘，变为国家建设的有用的资金，既发扬人民爱国主义精神，又可以鼓励储蓄。
    中国民主建国会总会于十六日发出通知，要求全体会员在这次认购、推销公债的工作中，在所联系的群众里发挥模范、带头作用，以实际的行动来表示对国家总路线的真诚拥护。通知里说：民建会各级领导除即与当地有关部门联系，推派适当人员参加公债推销委员会，并应研究组织动员的具体办法，务使全体会员，除踊跃认购公债外，并能在组织领导之下做好宣传、推销公债等工作。通知又说：由于这次公债发行数额不大，分配合理，各阶层人民都是力能胜任的，政府更照顾到无力购买者，规定不得强令他们购买，因此顺利完成这次发行公债的任务是可以肯定的。工商界过去认购人民胜利折实公债，一般有良好的表现，这次相信定能以积极的行动，响应政府号召，完成乃至超额完成光荣的购债任务。
    中国民主促进会总部在十六日的通知中，要求各级组织和全体会员踊跃认购，对所联系的群众，进行宣传工作。通知说，全国人民四年以来在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，生活日益改善，政治觉悟也大大提高，是完全能够完成认购的任务的。
    中国农工民主党中央执行局于十五日发出指示，指示各级组织认真进行学习、宣传和推销工作，以便在成员和所联系的群众中间展开一个认购公债的热潮。指示指出：人民购买公债，一方面是支援了国家经济建设，一方面又可以按期收回利息和本金，并日益增长地分享国家建设的果实。
    中国致公党中央委员会于二十八日发出指示，要求各级组织和成员学习有关文件，大力宣传发行公债的重大意义，深入体会如政务院指示中所说的，认购公债“不仅在经济上是筹集社会主义工业化所需资金的重要的和经常的方法之一，而且在政治上也是一种爱国主义的表现”。
    九三学社中央常务委员会于二十七日发出指示，说明认购国家经济建设公债是我们热爱祖国的真诚表现和支援国家工业化的具体行动，是每一个人对国家应尽的一项光荣义务。该指示号召社员踊跃认购公债，在群众中起带头作用。
    中华全国工商业联合会二十五日发出指示，要求各地工商业联合会或筹委会应在当地共产党和人民政府的领导下，结合国家总路线和总任务的宣传，利用各种集会和各种方式，切实做好这次发行建设公债的宣传动员工作。指示并指出：全国工商业者，四年来不仅有了盈余；并且由于中国共产党和中央人民政府的领导和教育，政治觉悟也有所提高，特别是经过国家总路线和总任务的学习后，全国工商业者的政治认识更加提高。因此，这次建设公债的推销工作在工商界中间是应该而且能够胜利完成的。
