Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 30th—The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC) released a protest letter on the evening of the 29th, written on November 6th by American, South Korean, and British POWs in the North Camp of the Demilitarized Zone to the NNRC. This letter exposes the despicable methods used by the US military command to intimidate and coerce those American POWs who were unwilling to return to their countries.

Attached to the POWs' protest letter to the NNRC were many letters and newspaper clippings sent by the US side to the POWs, most of which were intimidating. The POWs specifically pointed out in their protest letter: "Pay attention to all letters from Chicago, most of which are dated October 14th."

A letter from someone in California to Andrew Frugone stated: "Tell them they better come back... If you don't come back now, you'll never be able to come back again." Many letters and clippings are filled with anti-communist and slanderous propaganda from the Chinese and Korean sides.

Not only that, but the American military authorities also used pornography for enticement, attempting to use this vulgar method to pull back the American POWs in the North Camp. This can be seen in a letter from a "girl" to Levey Sullivan, which said: "There are not enough good men here to go out with, so please come back and help us." "I am willing to be a short-time friend or a long-time friend, if you say so." Attached to the letter were pictures of American girls clipped from newspapers.

Chairman Thimayya of the NNRC said in a reply letter to the POWs in the North Camp that the NNRC had established a subsidiary body to investigate the complaints and accusations raised by the POWs in the report and to make recommendations. The NNRC's reply letter stated: "We have noted that most of these letters are deliberately politicized, with the aim of influencing the thinking of the POWs. In the future, such things that may intimidate and coerce the POWs will not be allowed to be given to the POWs without proper review. We have also noted that certain inappropriate letters and mails have been given to you without review. In the future, your letters will be reviewed in accordance with the instructions issued by the NNRC. We have also noted that you can only get reading materials from the Allied side. We will see to it that this kind of thing does not happen again."

In their protest letter to the NNRC, the POWs accused "the Allied side of using letters and telegrams as a means of explanation, which is both illegal and despicable." They said that this was "a serious violation of the current agreement. Everyone knows that explanations should be carried out in the presence of the NNRC or its subsidiary bodies, as well as one observer representative from each side and one representative from the detaining party; if written explanations are given, such explanations must be reported to the above parties and approved by them. But this has not been done."

The protest letter continued: "This report can clearly show to all peace-loving and freedom-loving people how insidious and reckless the American government would be in order to get some or all of the non-directly repatriated POWs back. These accusations are supported by irrefutable evidence, which adds a new page to the already numerous American violations of the current Korean Armistice Agreement.

	"In this regard, the serious violations of the armistice agreement committed by the Allied side (the US side) are not just one but many times. This clearly shows the hypocrisy of their so-called 'voluntary repatriation,' and exposes the truth of their ugly and despicable actions to persuade us to return, which are in vain.

	"They have to use such tricks because they are very clear: they cannot convince us to go back with normal and appropriate explanations. Why? Because we know what we are doing. We are determined not to go back. Each of us has voluntarily decided not to go back, and we have not been subjected to any coercion, intimidation, or violence."

The protest letter said: "We demand that the Allied side abide by the agreement it has concluded and immediately stop this vicious and illegal attack on us."

### 中立国遣返委员会公布不直接遣返的美方战俘的抗议信  揭露美方利用邮件恫吓战俘的卑鄙手段

    中立国遣返委员会公布不直接遣返的美方战俘的抗议信
    揭露美方利用邮件恫吓战俘的卑鄙手段
    【新华社开城三十日电】中立国遣返委员会二十九日傍晚公布了非军事区北营中的美国、南朝鲜和英国战俘于十一月六日写给中立国遣返委员会的抗议信，这封信揭露了美军司令部用来恫吓和胁迫这些不愿回国的美方战俘的卑鄙手段。
    在战俘们递交中立国遣返委员会的这封抗议信中，附有美方寄给战俘的许多信件和美国报纸剪辑，其中大部分都是带有恫吓性的。战俘们在抗议信中特别指出：“注意来自芝加哥的全部信件，日期大部分都是十月十四日。”
    加利福尼亚州的某人写给安德鲁·弗琼纳的一封信说：“告诉他们还是回来的好……如果你们现在不回来，就永远不能再回来了。”在许多信件和剪报中都充满了反共和诽谤朝中方面的欺骗宣传。
    不仅如此，美国军事当局还利用色情来进行诱骗，企图用这种下流手段来把北营中的美国战俘拉回去。这可以从一个“女郎”写给勒·维·苏利梵的信中看出，这封信说：“这里没有足够的好男人可以来往，所以请回来吧，帮帮我们的忙”。“我愿意和你作一个短时间的朋友，或长时间的朋友，如果你这样说的话。”附在信里的是一些从报纸上剪下来的美国女郎的照片。
    中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅在给北营战俘的回信中说，中立国遣返委员会已成立一个附属机构来调查战俘们在报告中所提出的控诉和指责，并提出建议。中立国遣返委员会回信说：“我们已注意到，这些信大部分都是故意使之具有政治性的，目的是要影响战俘的思想。今后如未经适当的审查，将不准把这种可能恫吓和胁迫战俘的东西交给战俘。我们也注意到，某些不妥的信件和邮件，未经审查而交给你们了。今后，你们的信件将根据中立国遣返委员会所发出的指示来进行审查。我们还注意到，你们只能得到联军方面的读物。我们将留意不再发生这类事情。”
    战俘们在写给中立国遣返委员会的抗议信中，指责“联军方面利用信件和电报作为解释的手段，这既是非法的，也是卑鄙的”。他们说，这是“严重的违反现行协定的行为。大家都知道，解释应在中立国遣返委员会或它的附属机构及每方观察代表各一名和拘留方代表一名出席的情况下进行；如果进行书面解释的话，须把这种解释报知上述各方，并要由它们予以通过。但这一点并未照办”。
    抗议信继续说：“这份报告可以向所有爱好和平与自由的人们清楚地说明，美国政府为了要把这方面的不直接遣返战俘的一部或全部弄回去，会采取多么阴险和不顾一切的手段。这些控诉是有无可辩驳的证据支持着的，它们使已经很多的美国违反目前朝鲜停战协定的行为又增加了新的一页。
      “在这方面，联军方面（美方）所犯的严重的违反停战协定的行为不只是一次而是好多次了。这清楚地说明了他们所说的‘自愿遣返’的虚伪性，说明了他们为了使我们回去而徒劳无益地对我们进行丑恶的和卑鄙的行动的真相。
    “他们不得不使用这样的伎俩，因为他们十分清楚：他们靠正常的、适当的解释是不能够说服我们回去的。为什么呢？因为我们知道我们在做些什么。我们已决心不回去。我们每一个人都是自愿决定不回去的，我们没有受到任何胁迫、恫吓和暴力。”
    抗议信说：“我们要求联军方面遵守它所缔结的协定，立即停止对我们进行这种恶毒的非法的进攻。”
