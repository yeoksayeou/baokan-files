Shanggao Township in the Ninth District of Tai'an County, Shandong Province, closely integrates with production and vigorously promotes the general line of the state during the transition period to farmers, prompting farmers to sell a large amount of surplus grain to the state and actively preparing to establish agricultural production cooperatives to strive for more grain production increases.

From November 1st to December 5th, Shanggao Township conducted in-depth propaganda and education on the general line of the state during the transition period to farmers. Local working cadres first explained the general line of the state during the transition period through various internal and external Party meetings in conjunction with current production, and cultivated activists and typical examples to educate the masses. After listening to the report on the general line, cadres and the masses were all elated and reflected that "they feel enlightened" and "work is more energetic." Many farmers said: Mutual aid teams are the seedlings of socialism. In order to strive for an early arrival in socialist society, they are determined to carry out mutual aid and cooperation and do a good job in winter production. The production work of accumulating fertilizer, hoeing wheat, and accumulating urine to water wheat in the township has been carried out during this period.

After the masses discussed the report on the general line, they conducted in-depth ideological mobilization through summarization and evaluation, using methods such as guiding recollection and comparison, accounting, and complaining about suffering. The evaluation was based on mutual aid teams, with the participation of individual farmers; without mutual aid teams, it was carried out in voter groups. The content of the evaluation was, first, to evaluate production. Through summarizing the annual production, affirming achievements, finding out the experience of increasing production, further studying the key to increasing production in winter, and promoting winter production. When farmers looked for reasons for increasing production, they deeply realized that they had produced more grain because of the leadership and support of the Communist Party and the People's Government. For example, this year the government lent the township more than 90 million yuan in various loans and supplied 32,000 jin of chemical fertilizers. More grain was produced because of waterwheels, chemical fertilizers, new farm tools, and pesticides. By calculating the narrowing of the price difference between industrial and agricultural products, farmers realized that only when industry develops can farmers get cheap industrial products. For example, before 1948, ten jin of wheat could be exchanged for one chi of cloth locally, but now more than two jin of wheat can be exchanged for one chi of cloth; in the past, half a jin of grain could be exchanged for a box of matches, but now the money for half a jin of grain can buy five boxes. Through the analysis of these facts, the ideological understanding of the worker-peasant alliance has been further improved, so that farmers realize the benefits of national industrial development for farmers, thus inspiring farmers to sell surplus grain to support national industrial construction. The second is to evaluate mutual aid and cooperation. By summarizing the fact that mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives generally increased production more than individual farmers, the farmers realized the benefits of organizing production; at the same time, by guiding farmers to recall the past, compare the present, and look forward to the future, they were inspired to complain about the suffering of the small-scale peasant economy, vividly carrying out the education of the two roads, so that farmers realized that only by organizing and taking the socialist road can they move from the poverty of the small-scale peasant economy to prosperity. Many cadres consciously examined their erroneous ideas that the revolution had been completely successful and that individuals could get rich, and improved their socialist consciousness and enthusiasm for organizing. For example, Zheng Xixiang, a township cadre, used to think that leading mutual aid teams was troublesome. He improved his awareness in the evaluation and is now actively organizing agricultural production cooperatives. At present, 24 mutual aid teams have been restored and newly developed in the township, and seven mutual aid teams and 51 farm households are preparing to establish three agricultural production cooperatives; the township has also established a credit cooperative on the basis of the original credit group (80 households), with more than 340 households participating. In the evaluation, a common conclusion reached by the farmers was: "Listening to the government is not wrong." So they signed patriotic production increase plans by household. After the plans were initially formulated, each group discussed them. During the discussion, many farmers complained about the suffering of being exploited by grain speculation profiteers. Based on their actual experience, the farmers realized that grain speculation profiteers are one of the root causes of price fluctuations and farmer poverty.

After conducting extensive propaganda and education to the farmers, the township people's congress was convened to summarize the previous work, commend the activists and model figures who actively led the masses in production and took the lead in selling grain, and discuss the work of purchasing grain. After the meeting, the representatives conveyed the resolutions of the representative assembly, and quickly set off a wave of grain sales. The whole township sold a total of 273,000 jin of surplus grain.

When helping farmers to formulate production plans, they were guided to make appropriate arrangements for the money obtained from selling grain. For example, Huangjiazhuang received 37.51 million yuan from selling grain, deposited 14.1 million yuan in the National Bank, repaid 4.5 million yuan in loans, invested 1.8 million yuan in the credit cooperative, and the rest was used to buy production materials, build houses, etc. This avoided waste and promoted production. While organizing the grain to be put into storage, the township further consolidated and developed mutual aid and cooperation organizations, carried out winter production, and prepared for next year's production.

    山东泰安县上高乡深入宣传总路线
    农民售出大批余粮准备扩大生产
    山东省泰安县第九区上高乡紧密结合生产，大张旗鼓地向农民宣传国家过渡时期的总路线，推动农民卖给国家大批余粮，并积极准备成立农业生产合作社，争取更多的增产粮食。
    上高乡从十一月一日到十二月五日向农民深入进行了国家过渡时期总路线的宣传教育。当地工作干部首先结合当前生产，通过党内、党外的各种会议讲解了国家过渡时期的总路线，并培养积极分子，培养典型，通过他们去教育群众。干部、群众听了总路线的报告以后，都欢欣鼓舞，反映：“心里亮堂了”、“工作带劲了”。许多农民说：互助组是社会主义的苗子，为争取早日到社会主义社会，决心把互助合作搞起来，并把冬季生产搞好。全乡积肥、锄麦、积尿浇麦等项生产工作，在这个期间都有了开展。
    在群众对总路线等报告进行了讨论以后，又通过总结评比，用引导回忆对比、算账、诉苦等方法深入进行了思想动员。总结评比时，以互助组为基础，吸收单干农民参加；没有互助组的，以选民小组为单位进行。评比的内容，第一是评比生产。通过总结全年生产，肯定成绩，找出增产经验，进一步研究冬季增产关键，推动冬季生产。农民们在找增产原因时，深切体会到有了共产党和人民政府的领导、扶持，才多打了粮食。如今年政府贷给该乡各种贷款九千多万元，供应化学肥料三万二千斤。因为有了水车、化学肥料、新式农具和农药才多打了粮食。通过计算工农业产品差价缩小的情况，农民们认识到只有工业发展了农民才能得到廉价的工业品。如当地一九四八年以前十斤麦子换一尺布，现在二斤多麦子就换一尺布；过去半斤粮食换一盒火柴，现在半斤粮食的钱能买五盒。通过对这些事实的分析，更加提高了农民对工农联盟的思想认识，使农民认识了国家发展工业对农民的好处，因而启发了农民出售余粮支援国家工业建设的积极性。第二是评比互助合作。通过总结互助组、农业生产合作社比单干农民普遍增产的事实，使农民们都认识到组织起来进行生产的好处；同时通过引导农民回忆过去，对比现在，展望将来，启发他们诉小农经济的苦，生动地进行了两条道路的教育，使农民认识到只有组织起来走社会主义的道路，才能从小农经济的贫困境地走向富裕。不少干部自觉地检讨了认为革命已经完全成功和个人发家致富的错误思想，提高了社会主义觉悟和组织起来的积极性。如乡干部郑西祥过去领导互助组嫌麻烦，评比中提高了觉悟，现在正积极组织农业生产合作社。目前全乡恢复和新发展了二十四个互助组，有七个互助组、五十一户农民准备成立三处农业生产合作社；该乡还在原有信贷组（八十户）的基础上成立了信贷合作社，有三百四十余户参加。在评比中，农民们得出的一个共同的结论是：“听政府的话没有错”。于是纷纷以户为单位，订爱国增产计划。计划初步订出后，各组都进行了讨论。在讨论中，许多农民诉了受粮食投机奸商剥削的苦。农民们根据实际体验，认识到粮食投机奸商是物价波动和农民贫困的老根子之一。
    在广泛向农民进行了宣传教育以后，便召开乡人民代表大会，总结前段工作，表扬积极领导群众生产和带头卖粮的积极分子和模范人物，同时讨论了收购粮食的工作。会后，代表们分头传达了代表大会的决议，很快掀起了售粮热潮。全乡共卖出余粮二十七万三千余斤。
    在帮助农民订生产计划时，即曾引导农民将卖粮得到的款作了适当安排。如黄家庄卖粮得到的三千七百五十一万元，存入国家银行一千四百一十万元，还贷款四百五十万元，在信贷合作社入股一百八十万元，其余用来买生产资料、盖房子等。这样就避免了发生浪费现象，并推动了生产。在组织粮食入库的同时，该乡还进一步整理发展了互助合作组织，开展冬季生产，为明年的生产作了准备。
