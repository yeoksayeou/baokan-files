Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 10th—The Korean-Chinese side now has new evidence to further confirm that the U.S. military authorities are still forcibly detaining a large number of Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war and forcing them to serve as U.S. special agents, sending them into our area to carry out sabotage and espionage activities against us. The report of Wang Yongxiang (pseudonym Wang Xiang), a Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoner of war who fell into our hands and was forcibly detained and given special agent training by the U.S. military authorities, exposes this serious act by the U.S. side of violating the Korean Armistice Agreement.

Wang Yongxiang (pseudonym Wang Xiang) was originally a member of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and was captured on July 18th of this year. He was sent by the U.S. side across the military demarcation line on November 20th of this year. After entering our area, Wang Yongxiang reported to us the process of being forced to serve as a U.S. special agent.

According to Wang Yongxiang's report, after he was captured, the U.S. military sent him to a prisoner-of-war camp near Yeongdeungpo, southwest of Seoul. On July 23rd, a U.S. officer in the prisoner-of-war camp said to him during interrogation: "It is impossible for you to go home now. The only way out is to serve the Allied forces." The next day, the U.S. military called him and seventeen other Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war into a room. Inside, there was a U.S. officer and two American soldiers holding clubs. They forced these prisoners of war to put their thumbprints on a piece of paper, and then they took off the clothes with prisoner-of-war markings they were wearing in the prisoner-of-war camp and put them in U.S. military uniforms. That night, they were sent to Seon gap Island, more than 60 kilometers southwest of Incheon.

Wang Yongxiang said that the U.S. military intelligence agency was located on this island. In the agency, there was a tall, fat U.S. lieutenant and two other U.S. personnel. There were also six "instructors," five of whom were Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents, and one was a Rhee Syngman group special agent. The Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents said that this agency was the "intelligence agency of the U.S. Far East Command." In this agency, a total of more than 160 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war were forcibly detained. More than 130 of these prisoners of war were sent there from prisoner-of-war camps in Busan and other places. These people all had words forcibly tattooed on their bodies in the prisoner-of-war camps. They had already been forced to undergo special agent training. Some of them, in order to facilitate their espionage work, had the words tattooed on their bodies changed to various patterns.

Wang Yongxiang said that these prisoners of war on Seon gap Island had no knowledge of the news about the repatriation of prisoners of war after the Korean Armistice or the transfer of non-directly repatriated prisoners of war to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for supervision. Starting in early October, he and twenty-four others were forced to undergo three weeks of special agent training, teaching them how to gather military intelligence and how to cross the military demarcation line and sneak into our area.

Wang Yongxiang said that after completing the special agent training, on November 17th, Zhang Xiuyi, a Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agent "instructor," escorted him and five others from Seon gap Island to a special agent agency in a mountain gully three miles north of Seoul. In this agency, he saw more than thirty Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who had been transferred from Seon gap Island earlier were being forced to carry out espionage tasks. On November 20th, a Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agent in this special agent agency changed him into a set of forged Volunteer Army clothes, gave him four forged Volunteer Army identification documents, a compass, and some daily necessities, told him to use the pseudonym Wang Xiang, and ordered him to go to the Icheon area to gather military intelligence about the Korean-Chinese People's troops. At 7:00 p.m. that day, a U.S. officer escorted him to the southern edge of the demilitarized zone north of Cheorwon. The U.S. officer gave him a Thompson submachine gun and then ordered him to cross the military demarcation line.

The Korean-Chinese side has repeatedly pointed out in the Military Armistice Commission that the U.S. side is still forcibly detaining a large number of Korean-Chinese prisoners of war and has submitted a list including 98,742 Korean-Chinese prisoners of war, demanding that the U.S. side provide a responsible explanation. Wang Yongxiang's report fully demonstrates why the U.S. side, with a guilty conscience, has been hesitant to provide a responsible and concrete explanation for the whereabouts of each of our captured personnel on the list submitted by the Korean-Chinese side.

    美方仍然强迫扣留着大批我方被俘人员
    王永祥向我方提供美方强迫战俘充当特务的新罪证
    【新华社开城十日电】朝中方面现在又掌握了新的证据，进一步证实美国军事当局目前仍然强迫扣留着大批中国人民志愿军被俘人员，并且强迫他们充当美方特务，派遣他们潜入我方地区，来进行破坏我方的特务活动。落入我方手中的曾被美国军事当局强迫扣留并强迫施以特务训练的中国人民志愿军被俘人员王永祥的报告，揭发了美方这种严重破坏朝鲜停战协定的行为。
    王永祥（化名王祥）原系中国人民志愿军人员，在今年七月十八日被俘。今年十一月二十日被美方派遣越过军事分界线。王永祥在进入我方地区后向我方报告了他被迫充当美方特务的经过。
    据王永祥报告说，他被俘以后，美军把他送到汉城西南永登浦附近的战俘营中。七月二十三日，战俘营中的一个美国军官在审问他时对他说：“现在你想回家是不可能的，只有为联军服务才有出路。”第二天，美军就把他及其他十七个中国人民志愿军被俘人员叫到一间房子里，里面有一个美国军官和二个拿着棍棒的美国兵，他们强迫这些被俘人员每人在一张纸上按上了两个大拇指的指印，然后就给他们脱下在战俘营中穿的带有战俘字样的衣服，换上美军军装。当天夜里，就把他们送到了仁川西南六十多公里的仙甲岛上。
    王永祥说，美军特务机关就设在这个岛上。在机关里有一个身体高大肥胖的美军中尉和另外两个美军人员。还有六个“教官”，其中五个是台湾蒋匪特务，一个是李承晚集团特务。台湾蒋匪特务说，这个机关是“美军远东总司令部的情报机关”。在这个机关中一共强迫扣留了一百六十多名中国人民志愿军被俘人员。其中有一百三十多名被俘人员是从釜山等地的战俘营中送到那里去的，这些人身上都带着在战俘营中被强迫刺的字，他们已经被强迫受过了特务训练，有的为了使特务工作方便，又把身上刺的字改刺成各种花纹。
    王永祥说，在仙甲岛上的这些被俘人员根本不知道关于朝鲜停战后遣返战俘和把不直接遣返战俘交给中立国遣返委员会看管等消息。从十月初开始，他和其他二十四人就被强迫受了三个星期的特务训练，训练他们怎样探听军事情报，怎样越过军事分界线潜入我方地区等。
    王永祥说，在受完特务训练以后，十一月十七日台湾蒋匪特务“教官”张秀义就押送他及其他五人离开仙甲岛到汉城以北三里的一条山沟里的特务机关中。在这个机关里，他看到早从仙甲岛调来的三十多个中国人民志愿军被俘人员正被迫执行着特务工作任务。到十一月二十日，这个特务机关里一个台湾蒋匪特务给他换上了一套伪造的志愿军衣服，发给他四张伪造的志愿军证明文件、一枚指南针和一些日用品，叫他化名王祥，并命令他到伊川一带去探听朝中人民部队的军事情报。当天下午七时，一个美国军官押送他到铁原以北的非军事区南缘，美国军官交给他一支汤姆手枪，然后就命令他越过军事分界线。
    朝中方面早在军事停战委员会上一再指出美方仍然强迫扣留着大批朝中被俘人员，并提出一份包括九万八千七百四十二名朝中被俘人员的名单，要求美方作负责的交代。王永祥的报告，充分说明了作贼心虚的美方为什么迟迟不敢对朝中方面提出的名单中每一名我方被俘人员的下落作出负责的具体的交代。
