Xinhua News Agency Report: The engineering quality of the newly built large rolling mill of Anshan Iron and Steel Company is very good, which is the result of the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts and the high responsibility of the factory construction workers. According to the strict completion acceptance results, the vast majority of the main projects are of excellent quality (that is, they have reached the highest standards), and the quality of other projects also meets the design standards. This is the fundamental guarantee for the smooth production of this modern factory in the future.

The large rolling mill is a large-scale and technically complex mechanized and automated factory, with exceptionally strict technical standards. Whether this standard can be achieved is the key to the success or failure of the factory's construction. In view of this situation, the vast number of factory construction workers paid great attention to the quality of the project during construction, and under the specific guidance of Soviet experts, took a series of technical measures to ensure that all projects not only met the design indicators, but also exceeded the design indicators in many cases. The most complex and important project in the entire factory is the installation of a huge number of mechanical and electrical equipment. The quality of the installation of this equipment directly affects the production of the entire factory. All 13,000 tons of mechanical equipment in the factory must be installed on a certain center line and must have a certain elevation. If the center line error of tens to hundreds of meters exceeds one hundred wires (one millimeter), and the elevation (up and down position) error exceeds fifty wires, it will be difficult to produce high-quality steel rails and various large steel products, and it will also greatly affect the production speed. However, the inspection results show that the center line error is mostly within fifty wires, and the elevation error is generally around thirty wires. The most important rolling mill, which is known as the lifeline of the entire factory's production, has been running continuously for sixteen hours without any abnormal heating, noise, vibration, etc. In particular, the tens of thousands of mechanical equipment bearings in the entire factory are running very well. Soviet experts said: "Bearings are the heart of the machine." If the clearance of the bearing is greater than or less than the design standard, abnormal rotation will occur, which will greatly shorten the life of the machine. According to the inspection by the Technical Supervision Department and Soviet experts, all bearings are installed in accordance with the design standards. The quality of the installation of various electrical equipment in the large rolling mill has a significant impact on the smooth operation of production, because mechanized and automated mechanical equipment is mainly controlled by electricity. If one motor fails, the entire production will be suspended, and if even one of the hundreds of millions of wire joints is connected incorrectly, there is a risk of damaging the equipment. According to the inspection results using the best instruments, the installation of these electrical equipment is in accordance with the design standards. The largest main drive motor in the main electrical room that drives the main mechanical equipment of the entire factory has no error in the center line and elevation. When it rotates continuously, the vibration is extremely minimal. The good rotation of this complex large motor was warmly praised by Soviet experts.

The quality of other projects in the large rolling mill is also very good. The more than 50,000 cubic meters of concrete equipment foundation project has a relatively complex structure. If the pouring is not firm, it will be difficult to ensure the safe operation of various mechanical and electrical equipment in the entire factory; if the equipment foundation is tilted or the concrete strength is insufficient, various mechanical equipment will be unable to operate at all. Because the materials used for these equipment foundations have been well tested and poured evenly, the concrete foundations meet the standards. Among them, the concrete strength of the largest No. 11 equipment foundation in the entire factory, which was constructed in the severe cold season last year, even exceeded the design standard. The design stipulates that the compressive strength per square centimeter is 170 kilograms, but the actual strength reached more than 200 kilograms. Because the equipment foundations are very solid, when more than 10,000 tons of various mechanical equipment in the entire factory are rumbling, there is no sinking, cracking, or tilting of each foundation. These equipment foundations are also equipped with a special waterproof layer, so they will not be eroded by groundwater. The huge factory building structure project, composed of thousands of tons of metal, is also extremely strong. The vast majority of the factory building structure is composed of advanced Soviet welding methods, which is much stronger than the structure riveted with rivets in the past in our country. The pipelines such as water pipes, steam pipes, gas pipes, oil pipes, and air pipes that are densely distributed throughout the factory like blood vessels in the human body are all installed correctly, the joints of the pipe heads are welded very firmly, and there are good anti-corrosion, thermal insulation and other protection devices. Therefore, there is no leakage phenomenon.

Every project in the large rolling mill of Anshan Iron and Steel Company has undergone multiple strict inspections from construction to completion. When a project is completed, in addition to the inspection by the construction workers themselves, it must also be inspected by the construction foreman, the construction responsible technical personnel, and the company's technical supervision department. The main projects must also be inspected by the Soviet experts at the end. Only when all the inspectors believe that there is no problem can the construction personnel transfer to new construction positions. When the large rolling mill entered the completion stage, Anshan Iron and Steel Company also organized a project completion acceptance committee and more than a dozen acceptance teams to conduct a final inspection of all projects and accept them at the same time. All these inspections are very serious, and any place that does not meet the design standards must be reworked. A screw on the gear box of the largest rolling mill in the entire factory had been over-tightened by two turns, and the Soviet experts insisted that it must be reinstalled. When the gear box was sealed, representatives from the Soviet experts, the construction engineering team, the engineering and technical section of the construction unit, the technical supervision station, the production unit, and the security department participated in the final completion inspection and solemnly signed the completion document.

    苏联专家热情帮助、建厂职工高度负责
    鞍钢大型轧钢厂工程质量非常好
    据新华社讯：鞍山钢铁公司新建大型轧钢厂工程质量非常良好，这是苏联专家热情帮助和建厂职工高度负责的结果。根据严格的竣工验收结果，绝大部分的主要工程都是优等质量（即达到了最高标准），其他工程的质量也都合乎设计标准，这是这个现代化工厂今后顺利进行生产的根本保证。
    大型轧钢厂是一个规模浩大、技术复杂的机械化、自动化工厂，技术标准异常严格，能否达到这个标准，是这个工厂建设成败的关键。根据这种情况，广大建厂职工在施工中非常重视工程质量，并在苏联专家具体指导下，采取了一系列的技术措施，使全部工程不但达到了设计指标，而且许多工程还超过了设计指标。全厂最复杂最重要的工程是庞大数量的机械设备和电气设备的安装，这些设备安装得好不好，直接影响着全厂的生产。全厂一万三千吨机械设备都要安装在一定的中心线上，并且都要有一定的标高，如果长达几十公尺到几百公尺的中心线误差超过一百道（一公厘）、标高（上下位置）误差超过五十道，就难以生产出优等质量的钢轨和各种大型钢材，并且还要大大影响生产速度。但是检查结果说明，中心线误差大部在五十道以内，标高误差一般都在三十道左右。被称为全厂生产命脉的最重要的轧钢机，曾连续转动了十六个小时，没有任何不正常的发热、杂音、振动等情况。特别是全厂数以万计的机械设备轴承，都转动得很好，苏联专家说：“轴承是机器的心脏”，轴承的间隙如果大于设计标准或小于设计标准，就会发生不正常的转动，因而会大大缩短机器的寿命，据技术监督处并苏联专家检查证明：所有的轴承都安装得合乎设计标准。大型轧钢厂各种电气设备安装质量的好坏，对于顺利进行生产有重大影响，因为机械化、自动化机械设备主要是靠电气操纵，如果有一台马达出了故障，就会使整个生产停顿，数以亿计的电线接头接错一个，就有损坏设备的危险。根据用最好的仪器检查结果，这些电气设备的安装都合乎设计标准。带动全厂主要机械设备运转的主电室最大的主传动马达，中心线和标高都一点不差，当它连续转动时，振动极微。这个复杂的大马达转动的良好情形，受到了苏联专家的热烈赞扬。
    大型轧钢厂其他各种工程的质量都同样很好。五万多立方公尺混凝土设备基础工程，结构相当复杂，浇灌得如果不坚固，就难以保证全厂各种机械设备和电气设备的安全运转；如果设备基础倾斜或混凝土强度不够，就会使各种机械设备根本无法运转。由于这些设备基础所用的材料都经过很好地化验，并且浇灌得均匀，混凝土基础都合乎标准。其中去年严寒季节施工的全厂最大的十一号设备基础混凝土强度并超过设计标准，设计规定：每个平方公分抗压一百七十公斤，实际达到二百公斤以上。由于设备基础非常坚固，当全厂一万多吨各种机械设备隆隆转动时，各个基础都没有下沉、裂纹、倾斜等现象。这些设备基础并设有专门的防水层，因而不会受到地下水的侵蚀。用数千吨金属组成的庞大厂房结构工程也坚固异常，厂房结构绝大部分是采用苏联先进的焊接方法组成的，它比我国过去用铆钉铆接的结构坚固得多。像人身上血管一样密布在全厂的水管、汽管、瓦斯管、油管、风管等管道，都安装得很正确，管头的接合处都焊接很牢实，并设有良好的防蚀、保温等保护装置。因而没有任何漏泄现象。
    鞍山钢铁公司大型轧钢厂每一件工程从施工到竣工都经过了多次严格的检查。当一项工程完成时，除了施工工人自己检查外，还要经过施工班长、施工专责技术人员、公司技术监督部门等进行检查，主要工程还要经过苏联专家最后检查，直到所有检查的人员都认为没有问题时，施工人员才能转到新的施工岗位。在大型轧钢厂进入竣工阶段时，鞍山钢铁公司又组织了工程竣工验收委员会和十多个验收小组，对所有工程再进行最后一次检查，并同时验收。所有这些检查都非常认真，有一处不合设计标准也要返工。全厂最大的轧钢机齿轮箱上有一个螺丝曾多拧了二扣，苏联专家就坚持一定要重新安装。当这个齿轮箱封盖时，苏联专家、施工工程队、施工单位工程技术科、技术监督处检查站、生产单位、保卫部门等都有代表参加最后一次竣工检查，并在竣工单上郑重签字。
