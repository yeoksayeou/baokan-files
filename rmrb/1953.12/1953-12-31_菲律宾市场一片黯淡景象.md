Xinhua News Agency report: In the Philippines, under the rule of U.S. imperialism, the market is experiencing a slow season during what should be its peak due to the increasing poverty of the people.

    Manila's "New Min Daily" reported on December 11th that the anticipated peak season before Christmas by merchants in various industries in the Philippines has failed to materialize. All kinds of goods, from children's toys to fabrics and food, have repeatedly fallen in price due to the scarcity of customers.

    The English-language "Philippine Bulletin" said that during the week of December 14th to 20th before Christmas in 1953, the turnover of department stores in the Philippines decreased by 20 percent compared to last year.

    菲律宾市场一片黯淡景象
    据新华社讯：在美帝国主义统治下的菲律宾，由于人民日益贫穷，市场出现了旺季淡市现象。
    马尼拉“新闽日报”十二月十一日报道，圣诞节前，菲律宾各业商人所憧憬的旺市都落空了。各项货品，由儿童玩具到布匹、食品，都因顾客稀少而一再跌价。
    英文“菲律宾公报”说：在一九五三年圣诞节前十二月十四日至二十日的一周间，菲律宾百货店的营业额比去年减少了百分之二十。
