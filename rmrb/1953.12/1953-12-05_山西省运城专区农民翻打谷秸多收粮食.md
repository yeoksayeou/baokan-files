Farmers in Yuncheng Prefecture, Shanxi Province, have mobilized to re-rake grain stalks, pan wheat bran, and dig out mouse holes, obtaining a significant amount of grain.

In late September, Wang Tingzhen, an old farmer in Xiading Village, Wenxi County, re-raked the wheat stalks from his twelve mu of land, harvesting six *shi* of wheat, an increase of five *sheng* per mu. Upon learning this, the Yuncheng Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party immediately issued a circular, calling on all localities to pay attention to and promote this experience, and to find more ways to increase grain income. Since the beginning of October, many county committees have carried out key experiments, and the results have proved that this is a good way to increase grain income. Xu Tiancheng of Dongguan Village, Jiang County, extracted four *dou* and six *sheng* of wheat from ten *shi* of wheat stalks. The Shanglvzhi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yongji raked through the wheat stalks on thirty mu of land, collecting 120 *jin* of wheat. The Taoli Agricultural Production Cooperative panned four *dou* and five *sheng* of wheat from sixty *dan* of wheat bran. According to statistics from partial populations in twenty-five villages, ten agricultural production cooperatives, and six mutual aid groups in seven counties—Xia County, Wenxi County, Jiang County, Anyi County, Yi County, Wanquan County, and Yongji County—a total of more than 5,600 *jin* of wheat were raked from wheat stalks. According to material statistics from partial villages in eight counties including Yi County, Anyi County, Xia County, and Wenxi County, the masses have obtained a total of more than 7,200 *jin* of millet, more than 900 *jin* of corn, and more than 3,700 *jin* of beans from the stalks of millet, corn, beans, etc., which were thought to have been already threshed clean. In addition, partial populations in fifteen villages in Xia County, Linjin County, and Anyi County picked up more than 2,200 *jin* of miscellaneous grains from the fields, totaling more than 14,000 *jin* of miscellaneous grains. According to existing statistics, these various methods have generated more than 23,000 *jin* of grain, enough to feed about fifty people for a year. The entire prefecture has a total of 6.6 million mu of wheat fields. After deducting the portion consumed by livestock, there are still an estimated 4 million mu of wheat stalks remaining. If they are all re-raked once, and two *sheng* of wheat are extracted per mu of wheat stalk, it is estimated that 80,000 *shi* of wheat can be harvested. (Jing Wencan, Yang Yang, et al.)

[Caption under picture:] For the construction of the motherland, farmers everywhere are selling their surplus grain to the state. The supply and marketing cooperative of the Ninth District of Jilin City is as busy as many grain purchasing stations. Every day, people selling grain and carts full of grain gather here in droves.

    山西省运城专区农民翻打谷秸多收粮食
    山西省运城专区各县动员农民重新翻打谷物秸秆、淘麦糠、挖鼠洞，获得很多粮食。
    九月下旬，闻喜县下丁村老农王廷祯把十二亩地麦秸翻打一遍，打出小麦六市斗，每亩多收五升。中共运城地委知道了，马上发出通报，号召各地重视并推广这一经验，并从多方面找窍门，增加粮食收入。自十月初以来，很多县委都进行了重点试验，试验结果证明这是增加粮食收入的一个好办法。绛县东关村徐天成从十石小麦的秸秆中翻出小麦四斗六升。永济上吕芝村农业生产合作社翻打三十亩地的麦秸，弄出麦子一百二十斤。桃李农业生产合作社在六十担麦糠中淘出麦子四斗五升。现据夏县、闻喜、绛县、安邑、猗氏、万泉、永济七个县的二十五个村部分群众、十个农业生产合作社、六个互助组的统计，共从麦秸中翻打出小麦五千六百多斤。另据猗氏、安邑、夏县、闻喜等八个县部分村的材料统计，群众在认为已经打净的谷子、玉米、豆子等秸秆内，共搞出谷子七千二百多斤、玉米九百多斤、豆子三千七百多斤，再加夏县、临晋、安邑三县十五个村的部分群众从田中拾回杂粮二千二百多斤，共计多收入杂粮一万四千多斤。据现有统计，用以上各种方法，共多收入了二万三千多斤粮食，约够五十个人吃一年。全专区共计六百六十万亩麦田的麦秸，除牲口吃去了一部分，现在按还有四百万亩的麦秸计算，如果普遍翻打一次，每亩麦秸内打出二升，估计可打出小麦八万石。      （景文灿、杨扬等）（附图片）
    为了祖国建设，各地农民纷纷把余粮卖给国家。吉林市第九区供销合作社和许多粮食收购站一样的繁忙，每天卖粮的人和装满粮食的大车都成群结队的向这里集中。
