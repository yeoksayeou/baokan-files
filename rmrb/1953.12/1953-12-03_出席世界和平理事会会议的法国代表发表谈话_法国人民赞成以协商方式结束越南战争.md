Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, December 2nd. Our reporter interviewed Jacques Mitterrand, a member of the French Federal Assembly and a French representative attending the World Peace Council meeting in Vienna. Mitterrand answered questions posed by our reporter.

    Q: What are your views on the speech made by the Vietnamese representative, Mr. Le Dinh Tham, at the World Peace Council meeting?

    A: The French delegation entrusted Professor Niel with speaking at the meeting, expressing support for Mr. Le Dinh Tham's proposal. The French delegation was deeply moved by the enthusiasm of the Vietnamese representative. The French delegation thanks the Vietnamese representative for the friendship expressed by the Vietnamese people towards the French people. The French delegation thanks the Vietnamese people for their spirit of adhering to negotiation.

    We, the French people, firmly believe that the proposal for negotiation put forward in the name of the Vietnam peace movement will definitely be valued by France. What can be done in Korea can certainly be done in Vietnam.

    Q: How will the French people promote a truce in Vietnam?

    A: If we were to ask the French people whether it is currently necessary to end the Vietnam War through negotiation, the majority of the French people would definitely answer in the affirmative. There are various reasons for this dissatisfaction with the current policy of the French government. Some believe that the principle of national self-determination does not allow France to continue fighting. Others believe that France can no longer endure the depletion of manpower and financial resources. Some also believe that France should not act as a mercenary for the United States in the Far East. Still others believe that if France continues to be paralyzed by the Vietnam War, it will be unable to solve domestic problems.

    For these various reasons, people from different parties and philosophical viewpoints gathered together and held a national conference in Paris on November 22nd to strive for negotiations with Vietnam. The conference passed a resolution calling for the launch of a movement to stop the Vietnam War through negotiation.

    出席世界和平理事会会议的法国代表发表谈话
    法国人民赞成以协商方式结束越南战争
    【新华社维也纳二日电】本社记者访问了出席世界和平理事会维也纳会议的法国代表、法兰西联邦大会议员雅克·密特朗。密特朗答复了本社记者所提出的问题。
    问：你对于越南代表黎廷探先生在世界和平理事会会议上的发言有什么意见？
    答：法国代表团曾委托奈尔教授在会议上发言，赞成黎廷探先生的建议。法国代表团对于越南代表的热情，深为感动。法国代表团感谢越南代表代表越南人民向法国人民所表达的友谊。法国代表团感谢越南人民这种忠于协商的精神。
    我们法国人民坚信，以越南和平运动的名义所提出的关于协商的建议，必将受到法国的重视。在朝鲜能够做得到的事，在越南也必定有可能做到。
    问：法国人民将如何促成越南的停战？
    答：如果我们征询法国人民的意见目前是否有必要以协商方式结束越南战争的话，大多数法国人民定将作肯定的回答。这种对法国政府现行政策的不满，有着各种不同的原因。有些人认为民族自决的原则不允许法国继续作战。另外一些人认为法国不能再忍受人力和财力上的消耗。也有一些人认为法国不能在远东充当美国的雇佣军。还有一些人认为如果法国继续为越南战争所瘫痪，它将无法解决国内问题。
    由于这种种原因，不同党派和不同哲学思想的人们聚集到一起，在十一月二十二日在巴黎举行了争取与越南谈判全国会议，会议并通过决议，号召展开以协商方式停止越南战争的运动。
