    Further Develop the Increase Production and Practice Economy Work in the Cultural and Educational System
    Ma Jianmin
    The increase production and practice economy work of various departments under the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Central People's Government for the past three months has achieved initial results. All units have conducted preliminary inspections of this year's plans for undertakings, finance, capital construction, and business management, exposing many phenomena of waste and stockpiling of funds and materials. Some departments that did not pay attention to personnel and financial work in the past are now beginning to pay attention. Most business units have formulated plans for increasing production and practicing economy. All public institutions have reduced their expenses twice this year, saving a lot of financial resources for the country. All administrative departments have drafted plans for streamlining organizations and personnel, some reducing the levels of organizations, some combining offices, and some cutting unnecessary organizations. Some units have combined streamlining with inspection, and the quality and efficiency of work have begun to improve. However, up to now, the development of increase production and practice economy work in the cultural and educational system is not widespread and in-depth enough, and it must be further developed and deepened on the existing basis.
    This first requires strengthening the political and ideological education on increase production and practice economy, strengthening the education on the general line and general task during the transition period, and constantly overcoming various ideological obstacles. The facts of the past three months have proved that units that have learned the general line better have also achieved better results in increasing production and practicing economy. Some units used to have some incorrect understanding of the increase production and practice economy work. Some believe that increase production and practice economy is a matter for factories, mines, enterprises, and financial departments, and that the cultural and educational system has "not much funding, not much waste" and "saving a little is of no help." Some believe that increase production and practice economy work is just a gust of wind, a temporary crash task. After studying the general line, these ideas have been basically corrected. As a result, units that originally wanted to add to their budgets this year no longer need to, and those who said that personnel could not be streamlined can now be streamlined. But in general, the study of the general line in various units is still far from enough, and they have not strictly promoted the increase production and practice economy work in accordance with the spirit of the general line. Some still have incorrect understanding of increase production and practice economy. Why is increase production and practice economy positive rather than negative? Why is it long-term rather than short-term? Why is it everyone's responsibility rather than a few people's business? These principles must be repeatedly publicized and explained in light of the ideological situation of cadres in each unit, so that the ideological obstacles of all cadres can be completely eliminated. This is a prerequisite for the widespread and in-depth development of increase production and practice economy work.
    Secondly, increase production and practice economy must be further combined with inspection, improvement of work, improvement of leadership, and improvement of work efficiency and work quality. This has also been proven by the experience of the past three months. Only by deeply inspecting the implementation of the 1953 plans for undertakings, finance, capital construction, production, etc., in accordance with the requirements of the general line, can we specifically understand which plans are unrealistic, and thus know how to use the funds for undertakings more rationally. This is the most effective method of increase production and practice economy. Although the draft plans for next year have almost been completed by all departments, this does not mean that the plans themselves have no problems. We must promptly change and improve our plans according to the requirements of the general line and general task during the transition period, the spirit of increase production and practice economy, and the specific situation of plan implementation in various places, so that they are more in line with reality. This is the key to effectively and regularly carrying out increase production and practice economy work.
    Thirdly, we must further implement the central government's streamlining policy. The streamlining policy is one of the major measures to ensure the realization of the country's socialist industrialization. The streamlining work of the central cultural and educational system departments has achieved great results, but the phenomena of overlapping organizations, oversized staffing, and uneven workload still exist quite commonly. Some cadres emphasize the contradiction between streamlining and tasks and cannot implement the streamlining policy; some do not proceed from the overall situation and still expand the staffing that should not be expanded; some pay attention to the streamlining of administrative departments and ignore the streamlining of public institutions and business units. These phenomena can only be overcome by combining the inspection of business work with in-depth political and ideological education. If all cultural and educational administrative organs, schools, hospitals, and other units can be careful in using human resources, a lot of manpower and material resources can definitely be saved.
    Fourthly, we must strengthen the leadership and management of financial work. Leading cadres of each unit should have someone specifically responsible for leading financial work, always pay attention to checking the implementation of financial plans, and constantly improve the ideological and political level of financial staff. Operating expenses account for the largest proportion of cultural and educational funding, so we must first pay attention to managing operating expenses well and overcome the past phenomenon of strict administrative expenses and loose operating expenses. Some departments in the cultural and educational system do not have a budget, and the existing budget is not strictly reviewed, the accounting system is not sound, the warehouse management system is not perfect, and the review of domestic and foreign orders is not strict enough, and the phenomenon of no one being responsible is even more serious. This has caused many phenomena of stockpiling and wasting materials. In order to change this situation, we must establish and improve various necessary financial systems, strictly implement financial discipline, strengthen the inspection and supervision of financial work, and fight against various phenomena that violate national financial regulations. At the same time, we must pay attention to revising certain unreasonable financial expenditure standards and rationally determining staffing quotas. For example, the subsidy for hospital beds and epidemic prevention expenses in health undertakings, as well as the expenses of county and district health centers and maternal and child health clinics, are too high in some places. The teaching equipment fees and teaching administrative fees in education undertakings are also too high in some places. This requires detailed research and resolute improvement by all departments. The remaining funds at the end of this year in each unit must be handled in accordance with national regulations, and we must strictly prevent the waste of purchasing non-essential items with the remaining funds at the end of last year in some units. The central departments should also earnestly prepare the annual budget plan for 1954.
    Fifthly, we must further strengthen the management of capital construction in the cultural and educational system. The construction area and capital construction investment of the cultural and educational system are very large every year. Relaxing the leadership and management of this work can easily cause huge waste. All construction units should fully explore the potential of existing buildings and instruments and equipment, and make use of them. Existing houses should not be demolished lightly, and organs should not be relocated easily. We must strengthen the planning of capital construction work, avoid the waste phenomenon of some construction plans often changing in some places over the past year, resulting in frequent work stoppages and rework; and we should distinguish between priorities and urgencies according to the needs of the undertakings, reasonably arrange the order of projects, and ensure the smooth progress of key projects. We must strictly control the financial budget of capital construction, and should not overspend, and we must use the minimum amount of funds to meet the maximum requirements of the undertakings for capital construction work. We must strictly pay attention to the quality of the projects. Even if housing is urgently needed, we should not construct them hastily and reduce the quality. We must oppose the phenomenon of blindly raising the building structure, the design requirements should not be too high, the decoration should not be excessive, and we must implement the principle of thrift in a pragmatic way.
    Finally, we must further strengthen the leadership and management of cultural and educational enterprises. There are 52 cultural and educational enterprises directly under the central units alone, and the amount of funds is also not small. The finished products of film enterprises, printing enterprises, publishing enterprises, broadcasting enterprises, etc. are of great significance to the improvement of the people's political and ideological level and cultural and artistic level. Except for a few units that are in good condition, the products of other units are high in cost and low in quality, and the phenomenon of stockpiling funds and waste is still quite serious. All business units should further establish the concept of economic accounting, eliminate the remnants of the supply system, and establish and improve the accounting system and statistical system. We must deeply check the implementation of the increase production and practice economy plan, and in accordance with the spirit of increase production and practice economy, mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and prepare the draft plan for 1954 and the production plan for the first quarter of 1954.
    Further developing the increase production and practice economy work in the national cultural and educational system is of great significance for implementing the Party's general line and general task, for gradually realizing the country's socialist industrialization, and for the national cultural and educational construction. Let us continue to advance on the road of increase production and practice economy!

    进一步开展文教系统的增产节约工作
    马建民
    中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会所属各部门三个月来的增产节约工作，已经取得了初步的成绩。各单位对于今年的事业、财务和基本建设等计划以及企业管理工作，都进行了初步检查，揭发了许多浪费和积压资金、物资的现象。有些过去不注意人事工作和财务工作的部门，现在开始注意了。大多数企业单位都制定了增产节约计划。各事业单位二次核减今年经费，为国家节省了大量财力。各行政部门都已拟定了精简机构和人员的方案，有的减少了机构层次，有的合署办公，有的裁减了不必要的机构。有些单位并使精简工作和检查工作相结合，工作质量和工作效率开始提高。但直到目前为止，文教系统增产节约工作的开展，还不够普遍，不够深入，必须在已有的基础上，进一步开展起来，深入下去。
    这首先需要加强增产节约的政治思想教育，加强过渡时期总路线和总任务的教育，不断克服各种思想障碍。三个月来的事实证明，凡是学习总路线的成绩较好的单位，增产节约的成绩也较好。有些单位对于增产节约工作曾有一些不正确的认识。有的认为增产节约是厂矿企业和财务部门的事，文教系统“经费不多，浪费也不大”、“节约星星点点无济于事”。有的认为增产节约工作，不过是一阵风，是临时的突击性工作。经过对总路线的学习，这些思想已基本上纠正了。因而原来今年要追加预算的单位不再追加了，原来说人员不能精减的也可以精减了。但一般地说，各单位对于总路线的学习还很不够，也还没有严格地根据总路线的精神，来推进增产节约工作，有的对增产节约仍有不正确认识。增产节约为什么是积极的而不是消极的？为什么是长期的而不是短期的？为什么是人人有责而不是少数人的事？这些道理，必须结合各单位干部思想情况，反复进行宣传解释，使全体干部的思想障碍彻底消除。这是普遍而深入地开展增产节约工作的先决条件。
    其次，增产节约必须进一步和检查工作、改进工作、改进领导、提高工作效率和工作质量相结合。这也是由三个月来的经验证明了的。只有根据总路线的要求，深入地检查一九五三年的事业、财务、基本建设、生产等计划的执行情况，才能具体了解那些计划不切实际，从而知道如何更合理地使用事业经费。这就是最有效的增产节约方法。虽然各部门明年的计划草案即将做好，但这不等于说计划本身就没有问题了。必须根据过渡时期总路线和总任务的要求，根据增产节约的精神，根据各地执行计划的具体情况及时地变更和改善我们的计划，使之更切合实际。这是有效地经常进行增产节约工作的关键所在。
    第三，必须进一步贯彻中央的精简方针。精简政策是保证实现国家的社会主义工业化的重大措施之一。中央文教系统各部门的精简工作已有很大成绩，但机构重叠，编制庞大，忙闲不均的现象，还相当普遍地存在着。有的干部强调精简和任务之间的矛盾，不能贯彻精简政策；有的不从整体出发，仍然扩大不应扩大的编制；有的注意行政部门的精简，而忽略事业部门和企业单位的精简。这些现象只有结合检查业务工作，进行深入的政治思想教育，才能克服。如果所有文教行政机关、学校、医院及其他单位在使用人力方面都能精打细算，那一定可以节省大量人力物力。
    第四，必须加强对财务工作的领导和管理。各单位领导干部中应有专人负责领导财务工作，经常注意检查财务计划的执行情况，并不断提高财务工作人员的思想政治水平。事业费在文教经费中所占比重最大，首先要注意管好事业费，克服过去行政费严、事业费宽的轻重倒置的现象。文教系统有的部门没有预算，而对已有的预算审查得又不严格，会计制度不健全，仓库管理制度不完善，国内外订货的审查也不够严格，无人负责的现象更为严重。这就造成了许多积压、浪费物资的现象。为了改变这种情况，必须建立和健全各种必要的财务制度，严格执行财政纪律，加强对财务工作的检查和监督，向各种违反国家财政制度的现象作斗争。同时，必须注意修正某些不合理的财务开支标准，合理地定员定额。例如卫生事业的病床补助费、防疫费以及县区卫生院、妇幼保健所的经费，有些地方就过多。教育事业的教学设备费、教学行政费，有些地方也有过多的情况。这是须要各部门详细研究、坚决改进的。各单位今年年底结余经费，必须按照国家规定，加以处理，严防发生像去年年底有些单位以结余款项购买非必需品的浪费现象。中央各部门更应认真编好一九五四年年度预算计划。
    第五，必须进一步加强文教系统的基本建设管理工作。文教系统的建筑面积和基本建设投资，每年的数目字都是很大的。放松了对这个工作的领导和管理，便很容易造成巨大的浪费。各建设单位应充分发掘原有建筑及仪器设备等的潜力，加以利用。现有房屋不应轻率拆除，机关也不要轻易搬迁。必须加强基本建设工作的计划性，避免重复一年来有些地方时常改变某些建筑计划，以致时常停工返工的浪费现象；并应根据事业的需要，分清轻重缓急，合理安排工程的先后主次，保证重点工程的顺利进行。要严格掌握基本建设的财务预算，不应超支，要利用最少限度的资金满足事业上对于基本建设工作的最大要求。要严格注意工程质量，即使用房紧迫，也不应草率施工，降低质量。必须反对盲目提高建筑结构的现象，设计要求不能过高，装饰不应过分，要实事求是地贯彻节约原则。
    最后，必须进一步加强对文教企业的领导和管理。仅中央各单位直属的文教企业就有五十二个单位，资金的数目也不少。像电影企业、印刷企业、出版企业、广播企业等所产成品，对于人民的政治思想水平和文化艺术水平的提高，都有很大关系。除少数单位的情况较好外，其他单位的产品，成本高、质量低，积压资金和浪费的现象仍然相当严重。各企业单位应进一步树立经济核算制思想，肃清供给制思想的残余，建立和健全会计制度、统计制度。要深入检查增产节约计划的执行情况，并根据增产节约的精神，发动群众，依靠群众，编好一九五四年计划草案和一九五四年第一季度的生产计划。
    在全国文教系统中进一步开展增产节约工作，对于贯彻党的总路线和总任务，对于逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，对于全国的文教建设，都有重大的意义。让我们在增产节约的道路上继续前进吧！
