The extensive publicity and education work on the General Line has inspired the patriotic grain-selling enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers in the Northwest. On the vast Northwest Plateau, groups of farmers, driving carts and pushing wheelbarrows, are flocking to the grain purchasing stations from all directions to sell large quantities of surplus grain to the state. In November, the amount of surplus grain sold by farmers in the entire region increased by 30 percent compared to October.

Since late October, under the leadership of the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, a large number of Party and non-Party cadres in the Northwest have been studying the General Line of the state during the transition period in an intense and enthusiastic manner. From late November onward, they have been using various methods to carry out extensive publicity work among the farmers throughout the region.

The promotion of the General Line first received the enthusiastic support of organized farmers. The entire 264 households of the Jiajiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yongchang County, Gansu, the largest in the Northwest, decided to sell all 410,000 jin of surplus grain to the state, and 60 percent has already been sent to state warehouses. The Taibai Collective Farm in Mei County, Shaanxi, the first collective farm in the Northwest, achieved an all-round bumper harvest of economic crops this year. The farm members realized that oil crops play a very important role in the country's industrial construction and decided to sell all 179,800 jin of peanuts, sesame and other oil crops to the state. Farm member Wang Chenggun said: "The other day, private merchants also wanted to fraudulently purchase our peanuts, but we resolutely refused. We must sell them to the state to support industrial construction." Agricultural production cooperatives and many mutual aid teams, such as Mo Ruxin in Pingluo County, Ningxia, and Ma Tinghai and Jia Yulong in Shaanxi, took the lead in selling surplus grain to the state. Sixty-three mutual aid teams in the Ninth District of Zhangye, Gansu, sold nearly 300,000 jin of surplus grain in the first batch. These mutual aid teams have achieved an all-round bumper harvest this year, and they have a clearer understanding of the superiority of mutual aid and cooperation. In particular, they expressed their infinite gratitude for the state's loans for walking plows and chemical fertilizers, which enabled them to obtain a bumper harvest. They said:
  "Without the sprayers made by the workers for us, we don't know what kind of damage the insects would have done to the crops, and how could we have had such a bumper harvest this year!"

After hearing the publicity on the General Line, the broad masses of farmers had a preliminary understanding of the General Line and saw a beautiful vision. Under the leadership of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, a wave of patriotic grain-selling enthusiasm was set off. By mid-November, some farmers in the Ninth District of Zhangye County, Gansu, had sold more than 1.5 million jin of surplus grain to the state. By December 17th, farmers in the suburbs of Xi'an City had sold more than 1.4 million jin of surplus grain. In the twenty-odd days up to November 6th, farmers in the Fourth District of Zhongwei County, Ningxia, sold more than 400,000 jin of surplus grain. The average total purchase volume in various counties of the Yanqi Prefecture in Xinjiang has reached more than 90 percent of the original plan.

After selling surplus grain, farmers in various places, under the leadership of local cadres, actively purchased means of production or deposited the grain money in banks in preparation for expanding production next year. After selling more than 1.5 million jin of surplus grain, farmers in the Ninth District of Zhangye County, Gansu, in addition to repaying the state's agricultural loans, have deposited more than 95 million yuan in the bank, and some farmers have already purchased a portion of carts, livestock and production tools. Nineteen households in the Third Township of Zhongwei County, Ningxia, planned to buy nineteen head of livestock, and have now bought seven donkeys, two cattle, eighteen iron shovels and a cart. On the 15th of this month, farmers in the Tenth District of Xi'an City collectively sold the first batch of more than 430,000 jin of surplus grain. On the same day, 60 percent of the farmers deposited the proceeds from the grain sales in the bank. They assured Mayor Fang Zhongru that they would invest the money from the grain sales into production.

    西北农民出卖余粮后积极准备扩大生产
    大张旗鼓的总路线宣传教育工作，激发了西北广大农民的爱国卖粮热忱。在辽阔的西北高原上，成群结队的农民们吆着大车，推着小车，从四面八方涌向粮食收购站，把大批余粮卖给国家。十一月份全区农民卖出的余粮比十月份上升百分之三十。
    从十月下旬起，西北广大党内外干部在中共中央西北局领导下，紧张热烈地学习了国家在过渡时期的总路线后，从十一月下旬起，用各种方式向全区农民展开了大张旗鼓的宣传工作。
    总路线的宣传，首先获得了组织起来的农民的热烈支持。西北最大的甘肃永昌县焦家庄农业生产合作社全体二百六十四户农民，决定把全部余粮四十一万斤卖给国家，目前已有百分之六十送到国家仓库。西北第一个集体农庄——陕西郿县太白集体农庄，今年经济作物获得全面丰收，庄员们认识到油料作物对国家工业建设有很重要的作用，决定将十七万九千八百多斤花生、芝麻等油料作物全部卖给国家。庄员王成群说：“前两天私商还想骗购我们的花生，我们坚决拒绝了，我们一定要卖给国家，支援工业建设。”宁夏平罗县莫如信、陕西马廷海、贾玉龙等农业生产合作社和许多互助组，都带头把余粮卖给国家。甘肃张掖九区六十三个互助组，就卖出第一批余粮近三十万斤，这些互助组今年已获得全面丰收，他们对互助合作的优越性有了更明确的认识，特别是对国家贷给步犁和化学肥料，使他们得到丰产，表示无限感激，他们说：
  “没有工人给咱们造下的喷雾器，庄稼不知叫虫糟蹋成啥样子，哪里还能有今年这样的丰收！”
    广大农民听到总路线的宣传后，对总路线有了初步认识，看到了美丽的远景，在农业生产合作社、互助组带动下，掀起了爱国卖粮热情。甘肃张掖县九区一部分农民，到十一月中旬为止，就已卖给国家一百五十多万斤余粮。西安市郊农民到十二月十七日止，已售出余粮一百四十多万斤。宁夏中卫县四区农民，到十一月六日的二十多天中，就卖出余粮四十多万斤。新疆焉耆专区各县的平均收购总量，已达原计划的百分之九十以上。
    各地农民在卖出余粮后，在当地干部领导下，积极购置生产资料，或将粮款存入银行，准备扩大明年的生产。甘肃张掖县九区农民在卖出一百五十多万斤余粮后，除归还国家的农业贷款外，已存入银行九千五百多万元，有的农民已添买了一部分大车、牲口和生产工具。宁夏中卫县三乡十九户农民计划买十九头牲口，现在已买到七头驴、两头牛、十八张铁锹和一辆大车。西安市十区农民在本月十五日集体卖出第一批四十三万多斤余粮后，当天有百分之六十的农民将所得粮款存入银行，他们向方仲如市长保证，要把卖粮所得的钱投入生产。
