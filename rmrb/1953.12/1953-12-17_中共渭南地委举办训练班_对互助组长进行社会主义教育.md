The CCP Weinan Prefectural Committee held a training class, drawing 124 mutual aid team leaders to study the general line of the state during the transition period, starting November 19th. Before the study, the leadership used a "chatting" method to understand everyone's thoughts, discovering that most people had uneasy emotions, treating participation in the training as a burden. Some said, "It's enough to do a good job with the crops, why must we organize?" Some said, "Team members don't come when they have a good life, it gives me a headache, there's no way to handle it." Based on this situation, the leadership gave everyone a report on the general line, comparing the two paths of socialism and capitalism. This enlightened a small number of team leaders. At this time, the leadership guided everyone to recognize the country's general line based on their own experiences, using methods of recalling, comparing, and calculating detailed accounts, and they resolved to do a good job in mutual aid and cooperation.

The leadership of the training class first used the changes in farmers' production and lives before and after liberation to illustrate the beautiful prospects of socialism, encouraging everyone to move forward towards socialism. The team leaders had personally experienced many things, and they talked about them at length. Liu Shuxian from Weinan County had a family of five. Before liberation, they only had 1.7 mu of land, one waterwheel, and two mules, and they had to pay 4,000 jin of cotton every year. Due to debt collectors pressing him, he sold the waterwheel, and his life became impoverished, using wild vegetables to sustain themselves. After liberation, he received 4.5 million yuan in state loans over four years, and his burden was reduced from 600 jin of wheat to 124 jin. His land increased to 5.455 mu, and he bought a new waterwheel and 15 pieces of farm equipment. Production increased year by year. This year, he harvested 7 shi and 5 dou of grain, 200 jin of ginned cotton, and vegetables that could be sold for 2 million yuan. The whole family can not only eat their fill and dress warmly, but also have surplus grain. Liu Shuxian said happily: "This is a sight that hasn't been seen for generations. I must follow the Communist Party and do a good job in my mutual aid team, and transfer to an agricultural production cooperative before the lunar new year." Wang Tianyi from Heyang County recounted his rising living standards after liberation, and then sadly described his tragic life before liberation: debts of 46 shi of wheat caused 45 mu of land, a large cart, the stable, threshing ground, and even the mounting stone in front of the door, to be seized by usurers. In the end, he said: "I must go to socialism." Li Xingzhong from Tongguan County, recalling the time when the puppet township office injured his arm for conscription wheat, was too sad to speak. He said, "I must follow Chairman Mao. If we don't do it now, who will?" Many people were educated by these facts and saw the bright future of common prosperity.

After everyone recognized the country's socialist future, they compared the prices of industrial and agricultural products before and after liberation, explaining the importance of developing industry, and encouraging everyone's production enthusiasm to support industrial construction. Everyone talked about how the price of one dou of wheat before liberation could only buy two jin of iron, fifty jin of coal, five jin of salt, twelve boxes of matches, eight chi of Yanta cloth, two liang of cooking soda, three jin of white sugar, and half a jin of water pipe tobacco. Now the price of one dou of wheat can buy eight jin of iron, two hundred jin of coal, thirty-five jin of salt, two hundred and forty boxes of matches, fourteen chi and five cun of Yanta cloth, ten liang of cooking soda, eight jin of white sugar, and two and a half jin of water pipe tobacco. Yan Deqing from Lintong County said: "Before liberation, I bought a waterwheel with others and owed 300 jin of cotton, which I couldn't pay off every year." Guo Chengshan from Fuping County said: "Now a Liberation brand waterwheel only costs a little over 1.8 million yuan, equivalent to 193 jin of cotton, which is both cheap and convenient." These facts all show that it was very difficult for farmers to develop production and improve their lives before liberation. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party, with the development of industry, can farmers expand production and improve their lives. Through the comparison of prices before and after liberation, the mutual aid team leaders were also educated. Dong Shijun from Pucheng County sold a horse in 1949 and got the money for five shi of wheat, but ten days later, he could only buy two dou of wheat. He Cuncheng from Chengcheng County lost more than 8,000 jin of wheat when he exchanged mules in 1945 due to price fluctuations. These facts show that price fluctuations are very detrimental to farmers. Only when the state controls a large amount of grain and stabilizes grain and commodity prices can the majority of people live a good life.

Then, they guided everyone to compare organizing with going it alone, explaining that the socialist road is cooperative production for common prosperity, and the capitalist road is a few people getting rich and the majority becoming poor, so that everyone could recognize the two roads and resolve to do a good job in mutual aid and cooperative organizations. Although the team leaders had all been engaged in mutual aid teams for several years, and some were already preparing to transfer to agricultural production cooperatives, most of them did not understand that mutual aid teams were seedlings of socialism, cooperatives were semi-socialist, and that they would eventually develop into fully socialist agricultural production cooperatives. Some people simply regarded the increase in output as the result of their own good labor. Many individual farmers, seeing the increased output of mutual aid teams, did not recognize the benefits of organizing, but instead said disapprovingly: "Good luck, good harvest." But the facts are very clear: This year, the per-mu wheat yield of Wang Zhongxin's mutual aid team in Gaoling County was one-third higher than that of ordinary individual farmers, and cotton was 15 jin higher. This year, the per-mu wheat yield of Han Zhiyus mutual aid team in Lintong County was 1 shi and 4 dou and 5 sheng, the millet yield was 317 jin per mu, and the cotton yield was 77 jin and 10 liang per mu, while the average per-mu yield of wheat for individual farmers was only 1 shi and 1 dou, the millet yield was 200 jin per mu, and the cotton yield was 47 jin per mu. With this comparison, everyone saw the benefits of mutual aid and cooperation. Tian Chouyi from Yao County said regretfully: "If I could have studied like this last year, I wouldn't have gone down the wrong path. The four-household mutual aid team I led often didn't work together, and now there are only three households left." Zhang Yunting from Sanyuan County had improved production and living standards after joining the mutual aid team. Yuan Mudan from Hua County reviewed the mistakes he made when he withdrew from the team and worked individually. Che Bairen from Heyang also reviewed himself, saying: "There were problems in the team, and I had a muddled attitude. I must do a good job when I go back this time!" Through criticism and self-criticism, the team leaders clearly recognized the importance of developing mutual aid and cooperation.

Finally, they compared the social status of farmers before and after liberation, explaining the loveliness of the new society and improving everyone's understanding of the People's Government. It is understood that most of the mutual aid team leaders who participated in the training had been beaten, extorted, and blackmailed by landlords, local bullies, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and puppet township and bao personnel. After liberation, they were emancipated, received awards and praise from the People's Government, and a total of 104 people served as grassroots cadres and participated in representative meetings at the county level or above. This comparison deeply educated everyone. Wei Zhijing from Lintong County, recalling the death of his 14-year-old brother by the bandit army, expressed great hatred for the old society. Some angrily said: "Some people eat rice and forget the rice growers, only care about personal wealth, and don't care about national construction. Without the Communist Party, without Chairman Mao, without the People's Government, we can't live a good life."

Through recollection, comparison, and calculation, everyone further recognized the country's general line. Li Wenhua from Hua County said: "In the past, it was like a snail climbing a bamboo pole, it would slip back at the joints. Only after studying the general line did I fully understand it." Wang Zhongxin from Gaoling County said: "After studying the general line, I understood the benefits of mutual aid and cooperation." Wei Zhijing from Lintong County said: "Before, I only knew about socialism, but didn't know how to get there. After studying the general line, I know how to get there." Some team leaders understood the principle of gradually implementing the socialist transformation of agriculture, saying: "Gradually doesn't mean reaching the sky in one step, nor does it mean standing still. It means steadily moving towards socialism." After studying the general line, the mutual aid team leaders all confidently said: They will publicize to the masses when they go back, not only to rectify their own mutual aid teams, but also to help other teams; not only to sell their own surplus grain, but also to encourage everyone to sell surplus grain, and everyone will move towards socialism together.

    中共渭南地委举办训练班
    对互助组长进行社会主义教育
    十一月十九日，中共陕西省渭南地委抽调了一百二十四名互助组长，开办训练班，学习国家过渡时期总路线。学习前，领导方面用“拉家常”的方法，来摸大家的思想情况，发现多数人有不安情绪，把参加训练当作负担。有的说：“庄稼做好就对了，何必一定要组织。”有的说：“组员过好日子不来了，脑子都想痛，没办法。”根据这个情况，领导方面向大家作了总路线的报告，对比了社会主义和资本主义的两条道路。这样，少数组长心里明亮了。这时候，领导方面又引导大家根据自己的切身事实，用回忆、对比和算细账的方法，认清了国家的总路线，决心搞好互助合作。
    训练班领导方面，首先用解放前后农民生产和生活的变化情况，说明社会主义的美好远景，鼓舞大家向社会主义前进。各组长亲身经过的事情很多，谈起来都是一大串。渭南县刘述贤全家五口人，解放前只有一亩七分地、一辆水车、两头骡子，每年要交纳四千斤棉花。因债主催逼，他卖掉水车，生活就贫困下来，拿菜来糊口。解放后，他四年来得到国家贷款四百五十万元，负担由过去的小麦六百斤减轻到一百二十四斤，土地增加到五亩四分五厘，新买水车一辆和农具十五件，生产一年比一年提高了。今年，他收获粮食七石五斗、皮棉二百斤，蔬菜可卖二百万元。全家不仅可以吃饱穿暖，还有余粮。刘述贤高兴地说：“这是几辈子没有过的光景，我一定跟共产党走，要把自己的互助组搞好，赶农历年前转入农业生产合作社。”郃阳县王天义说了他在解放后生活上升的事实以后，伤心地叙说了他解放前的悲惨生活：负债四十六石麦，使四十五亩地、一辆大车和马房、场面、门前上马石，都被高利贷者抢走了。最后他表示：“我一定要到社会主义去”。潼关县李兴中，回想起伪乡公所为要壮丁麦打伤他的胳膊时，难过得说不出话来。他说：“我非跟毛主席走不可。现在咱不干，叫谁干？”许多人从这些事实中受到了教育，看到了大家富裕的远景。
    当大家认识了国家的社会主义前途以后，就对比解放前后工农业产品的价钱，说明发展工业的重要性，鼓舞大家的生产积极性，支援工业建设。大家都谈到：解放前一斗麦的价钱，只能买到铁二斤、煤五十斤、食盐五斤、火柴十二匣、雁塔布八尺、煮青二两、红白糖三斤、水烟半斤。现在一斗麦的价钱，能买到铁八斤、煤二百斤、食盐三十五斤、火柴二百四十匣、雁塔布一丈四尺五寸、煮青十两、红白糖八斤、水烟二斤半。临潼县阎德清说：“解放前和别人伙买了一辆水车，负债棉花三百斤，年年还不清。”富平县郭成善说：“现在一个解放式水车，只要一百八十多万元，折合一百九十三斤棉花，既便宜，又灵便。”这些事实都说明解放前农民要想发展生产，改善生活，是非常艰难的。只有在共产党领导下，发展了工业，农民才能扩大生产，改善生活。从解放前后物价的对比中，互助组长也受到了教育。蒲城县董世俊，一九四九年卖一匹马得了五石麦的钱，十多天后，只能买二斗麦。澄城县和存成，一九四五年换骡子时，因物价波动，损失了八千多斤麦子。这些事实，说明了物价波动，对农民是很不利的。只有国家掌握了大批粮食，稳定粮价、物价，多数人才能过好日子。
    接着又引导大家用组织起来对比单干，说明社会主义道路是合作生产大家富裕，资本主义道路是少数人发财多数人贫困，使大家认清两条道路，决心办好互助合作组织。各组长虽然都搞了几年互助组，有的已经准备转入农业生产合作社，但大都不懂互助组是社会主义的苗苗，合作社是半社会主义的，将来还要发展到完全社会主义的农业生产合作社。有些人把产量增加单纯地看成是自己劳动好的结果。许多单干农民看到互助组的产量增加，不认为是组织起来的好处，反而不服气地说：“运气、年景好”。但是事实很明显：高陵县王忠信互助组今年每亩小麦的产量，比一般单干农民高三分之一，棉花高十五斤。临潼县韩志玉互助组今年每亩地小麦产一石四斗五升，谷子每亩三百一十七斤，棉花每亩七十七斤十两，而一般单干农民的麦子每亩只产一石一斗，谷子每亩二百斤，棉花每亩四十七斤。这样一对照，大家看出了互助合作的好处。耀县田畴易懊悔地说：“如果去年能这样学习，我就不会走错了路。自己领导的四户互助组经常就不在一块做活，现在只剩三户了。”三原县张云亭，加入互助组后，生产提高，生活上升。华县袁牡丹检讨了退组单干的不对。郃阳车百忍也检讨说：“组内有问题，我抱着混的态度，这次回去要好好干哩！”经过检讨和批判，各组长清楚地认识了发展互助合作的重要。
    最后对比农民在解放前后的社会地位，说明新社会的可爱，提高大家对人民政府的认识。据了解，参加受训的互助组组长大部分受过地主、恶霸、蒋匪军、伪乡保人员的毒打、敲诈勒索。解放后，他们翻身了，受过人民政府的奖励表扬，担任基层干部和参加过县以上的代表会的，共一百零四人。这个对比，深刻地教育了大家。临潼县魏志敬，回想起他十四岁的弟弟被匪军害死时，对旧社会表示了极大愤恨。有的气愤地说：“有些人吃米忘了种谷人，只顾个人发财，不管国家建设了。没有共产党，没有毛主席，没有人民政府，日子是过不成的。”
    经过回想、对比和算细账，大家进一步认清了国家总路线。华县李文华说：“过去像屎盘牛爬竹杆哩，到节上就颠回来。这次学习了总路线，才完全通了。”高陵县王忠信说：“学习了总路线，才明白了互助合作的好处。”临潼县魏志敬说：“以前光知道社会主义，不知怎样去，学了总路线，知道怎样去了。”有些组长懂得了逐步对农业实行社会主义改造的道理，说：“逐步不是一步登天，也不是原地踏步，是要稳步地走到社会主义。”各互助组长经过学习总路线后，都信心十足地表示：回去要向群众宣传，不光要整顿好自己的互助组，还要帮助别的组；不光自己出卖余粮，还要带动大家出卖余粮，大家共同走向社会主义。
