Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 4th: The delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China participating in the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference issued the following communique:

	On December 4th, the seventeenth meeting of the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference was held. Due to the US side's deliberate stalling and refusal to engage in any serious discussion of the comprehensive proposal put forward by our side on November 30th, today's meeting still made no progress whatsoever.

	Our representative, Mr. Qi Shi Fu, spoke first, pointing out: Our side has put forward a comprehensive and reasonable proposal, which appropriately takes into account the opinions expressed by both sides since the beginning of the talks. On the issue of neutral countries participating in the political conference, we have also made significant efforts to accommodate the other side's opinions. These efforts have removed all the excuses for the other side to oppose the participation of neutral countries in the political conference, so they dare not openly oppose it anymore. But the other side is unwilling to see neutral countries truly participate in the political conference. Therefore, on the one hand, it still opposes the Soviet Union's participation in the political conference as a neutral country, and on the other hand, it has put forward all kinds of slanderous methods to limit the authority of neutral countries in the political conference. The purpose of all this is to turn the participation of neutral countries in the political conference into a farce. The other side knows very well that this unreasonable demand is absolutely unacceptable to our side. Their insistence on doing so is clearly aimed at delaying the convening of the political conference in order to realize their conspiracy to forcibly detain our captured personnel. Mr. Qi Shi Fu emphasized: Now the problem is very clear, the talks between the two sides cannot make progress until the other side abandons its unreasonable demands. If the other side still intends to convene a political conference, it should immediately abandon its unreasonable demands and seriously discuss and accept our comprehensive proposal. If the other side is determined to obstruct the convening of the political conference, then the other side must bear all the responsibility. What to do depends entirely on the other side's decision.

	However, despite repeated reprimands and exposures from our side, the US representative today more blatantly employed delaying tactics. In a speech lasting about an hour, the US representative avoided the main topic and once again fragmented and distorted the "terms of reference," insisting that the political conference could only discuss the issue of prisoners of war if it was held between December 22, 1953, and January 22, 1954. Our representative immediately pointed out: The "terms of reference" is a whole. Due to the other side's sabotage, our side's explanation work could not be carried out, and the ninety-day explanation provision in the "terms of reference" has been completely destroyed. Therefore, our side advocates the rapid convening of a political conference to discuss and resolve the issue of prisoners of war, and resolutely opposes the other side's delay of the political conference to unilaterally deal with the issue of prisoners of war. But no matter when the political conference is held, the political conference must first discuss and resolve the issue of prisoners of war. This is our firm and unwavering position. Those whose hands are stained with the blood of our captured personnel are not qualified to talk about humanitarianism here. The other side's statement exposed that the purpose of the other side's delaying the convening of the political conference is to forcibly detain our captured personnel, which is absolutely not allowed. In order to delay the time, the other side even used so-called administrative reasons to request a recess until Monday.

	Our side immediately pointed out: The more the other side delays, the later the political conference will be convened. Our side cannot agree. But because the other side insisted on a recess, our side could only express its agreement, but our side finally pointed out: The other side must bear the responsibility for the resulting delay.

### 关于政治会议问题的双方会谈仍无进展  我方斥美方拖延政治会议扣留战俘的阴谋

    关于政治会议问题的双方会谈仍无进展
    我方斥美方拖延政治会议扣留战俘的阴谋
    【新华社开城四日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国参加关于政治会议问题双方会谈的代表团发表公报如下：
    十二月四日，关于政治会议问题的双方会谈举行第十七次会议。由于美方代表蓄意拖延，对我方十一月三十日提出的全面的建议拒绝进行任何认真的讨论，本日会谈仍然未获丝毫进展。
    我方代表奇石福先生首先发言，指出：我方已经提出了一个全面的合理的建议，这一建议适当地照顾了双方自会谈以来所表达的意见。在中立国参加政治会议的问题上，我们也已作了重大的努力来照顾对方的意见。我们这些努力已经解除了对方反对中立国家参加政治会议的一切藉口，因此对方已不敢再公开反对。但对方是不甘心中立国真正参加政治会议的，因此一方面仍然反对苏联作为中立国参加政治会议，而另一方面又提出了种种污蔑性的办法，来限制中立国家在政治会议中的权限，其目的皆在于使中立国家参加政治会议变成一幕滑稽戏。对方明知道这种无理主张为我方所绝对不能接受，对方坚持这样做，其目的显然在于拖延政治会议的召开，以便实现其强迫扣留我方被俘人员的阴谋。奇石福先生强调指出：现在问题非常清楚，对方一日不放弃其无理主张，双方会谈就一日不能取得进展。如果对方还有意召开政治会议，那就应该立即放弃其无理主张，认真讨论并接受我方的全面建议。如果对方决心阻挠政治会议的召开，那么对方就必须负担全部的责任，何去何从，全看对方的决定。
    但美方代表虽经我方一再斥责与揭发，今日却更露骨地施展其拖延手段。美方代表在一小时左右的发言中，竟避开主题，再一次割裂并曲解“职权范围”，硬说政治会议只有在一九五三年十二月二十二日至一九五四年一月二十二日期间举行的情况下，才能讨论战俘问题。我方代表当即指出：“职权范围”是一个整体，由于对方的破坏，我方解释工作已不能进行，“职权范围”中九十天解释的规定已被破坏无余，因之我方主张迅速召开政治会议讨论并解决战俘问题，而坚决反对对方拖延政治会议以片面处理战俘问题。但不论政治会议何时召开，政治会议都必须首先讨论并解决战俘问题，此乃我方坚定不移的立场。手上涂满我方被俘人员的鲜血的人，是没有资格来这里谈什么人道主义的。对方这一发言暴露了对方拖延召开政治会议的目的，正在于强迫扣留我方被俘人员，这是绝对不能容许的。对方为了拖延时日，竟索兴藉口所谓行政性的理由，要求休会至星期一。
    我方当即指出：对方多拖延一日，就使政治会议迟一日召开，我方不能同意，但因对方坚持休会，我方只能表示同意，但我方最后指出：对方必须负起由此而产生的拖延的责任。
