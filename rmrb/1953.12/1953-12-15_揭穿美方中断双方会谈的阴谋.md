Exposing the US Conspiracy to Interrupt Bilateral Talks

The bilateral talks regarding the Korean political conference have reached a standstill. This is due to the rude action of the US representative Dean, who deliberately provoked a quarrel, walked out of the 23rd meeting midway, and unilaterally announced an indefinite adjournment. Dean's purpose in interrupting the talks was to prevent the political conference from being held, so that they could take unilateral action to forcibly detain more than 20,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who had not yet been given explanations, and maintain international tension. After the US used its agents' sabotage activities to bring the East Village explanation work to a standstill, they now deliberately provoked a quarrel to bring the Panmunjom bilateral talks to a standstill. After interrupting the bilateral talks, Dean shamelessly declared in Seoul that regardless of whether the political conference is held or not, all un-repatriated prisoners would obtain civilian status by January 22, 1954. This thoroughly exposes the US's conspiracy.

The joint statement by our representatives Qi Shi-fu and Huang Hua powerfully condemned the US's unreasonable actions. The facts fully demonstrate that interrupting the bilateral talks was undoubtedly a pre-determined step by the US. Since the beginning of the bilateral talks, Dean has exhausted all means to delay their progress. While the United States was doing its utmost to prevent the discussion of the Korean issue at the Eighth United Nations General Assembly and forcing the United Nations General Assembly to adjourn, the US negotiators at Panmunjom believed that the purpose of delaying the United Nations General Assembly had almost been achieved, and further actively arranged to sabotage the bilateral talks. At the 19th meeting on the 8th of this month, Dean put forward a so-called "draft proposal" of seventeen points. After this, he declared on the one hand that this was the US's "final proposal" and "would not be changed in any way," and on the other hand, he also threatened that he "has the power to interrupt the preparatory meeting at any time." In the meeting, he consistently ignored the questions raised by our side and specialized in wanting our side to sign his proposal. At the same time, the US propaganda machine spread the atmosphere that the bilateral talks were about to "collapse," saying that the hope of holding a political conference would "vanish." Then, Dean disregarded everything and took the action of interrupting the negotiations to implement the US's predetermined plan. Isn't this very obvious?

The seventeen-point so-called "draft proposal" put forward by the US was originally a method used to disrupt the talks. It not only continued to insist on the various unreasonable demands made by the US in the negotiations, but also retreated in many important issues compared with the attitude previously expressed by the US. In this "draft proposal," the US still unreasonably insisted on listing the Soviet Union as a party to the Korean belligerent parties to participate in the political conference; still insisted on various unreasonable restrictions on the neutral countries participating in the political conference; and refused to determine the neutral countries participating in the political conference, opposed determining the agenda of the political conference, and even denied that the political conference was a bilateral equal meeting, ridiculously advocating that the United Nations, which has no representatives from both North Korea and China, should serve as the secretariat of the political conference, and that the Secretary-General of the United Nations should send people to discuss the rules of procedure and administrative arrangements of the political conference with both parties. The US's insistence on and putting forward these absurd demands fully demonstrates that it is deliberately trying to expand and increase the differences between the two sides in the talks. Not only that, but the US's "draft proposal" regarding the voting procedure also contains an extremely cunning trick. On the one hand, the US insists on unit voting, and on the other hand, it insists that any country participating in the political conference should not be bound by the decisions of the political conference that it itself does not agree with. This is obviously intended to reserve room for the sabotage agreement of the Lee Seung-man group, which has been clamoring to destroy the peace in Korea.

The US's connivance at the Lee Seung-man group's breach of faith in sabotaging the prisoner of war agreement is well known. In June of this year, only ten days after General Harrison, the US representative participating in the Korean armistice negotiations, signed the "Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" agreement on behalf of the US, the Lee Seung-man group brazenly violated this agreement and forcibly detained more than 27,000 of our prisoners of war, putting the Korean armistice, which was about to be fully agreed upon at the time, in almost a critical situation. Now the US is obviously still conniving at the Lee Seung-man group's frenzied clamoring, and all fair-minded people have long been unable to tolerate the US setting up a trick again and repeating its behavior of destroying the agreement. The accusation of our representatives against the US for its breach of faith is completely based on facts and is therefore necessary. If the US wants to avoid this kind of accusation, it can only take a responsible and serious attitude, cancel its unreasonable voting method, and accept our side's proposal on the voting issue, so as to ensure that it fulfills its obligations under the agreement.

However, the US representative Dean did not take a responsible and serious attitude to clarify our side's questioning at all, but instead made unreasonable noises and yelled that our side's accusation against the US's breach of faith was an "insult" to the US government, and used this as an excuse to unilaterally announce the interruption of the bilateral talks. However, Dean's excuse is extremely boring. Because he had already publicly announced that he would "interrupt the negotiations at any time," it can be seen that this is not actually related to the so-called "insult" issue. Dean said that our side's accusation against the US was an "insult" to the US government because our side's accusation was "inaccurate." This is even more of a rogue's tone. Didn't the Lee Seung-man group violate the "Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" agreement and forcibly detain more than 27,000 of our prisoners of war? Didn't even American journalists report that Lee Seung-man was going to "release" the prisoners of war before Lee Seung-man took this action? Didn't American reporters repeatedly report that American troops were ordered not to interfere after this incident happened? Is it possible to say that the US negotiators in the Korean armistice negotiations did not represent the Lee Seung-man group? Obviously, Dean cannot deny these facts. Then, what is the Lee Seung-man group's action of forcibly detaining prisoners of war if it is not the US's breach of faith? The US's breach of faith was then subjected to the just condemnation of peace-loving forces all over the world and caused dissatisfaction among many of the US's allies. It was only due to our side's persistent efforts and the pressure of just condemnation around the world that the US guaranteed the implementation of the terms of the armistice agreement by the Lee Seung-man group. At the same time, since the US did not fulfill the responsibility promised by General Clark and recover the 27,000 prisoners of war, our side reserved the right to raise the issue of Lee Seung-man's forcible detention of prisoners of war at the political conference. In this way, the Korean armistice agreement was officially signed. Now, what reason does Dean, as the US representative, have to deny these facts?

The actions of the US representative Dean in the bilateral talks fully demonstrate that he has taken an extremely unserious and childish attitude towards the bilateral talks expected by the people of the world, and has even used the means of smearing the Soviet Union and other neutral countries and deliberately distorting our side's proposals to replace genuine discussions. Up to November 29, Dean made thirty-four questions, eleven "understandings," and a bunch of "assumptions" off the top of his head. One of the questions even included twelve small questions, in order to create a dispute that was of no benefit to the solution of practical problems. After careful and reasonable consideration on November 30, our side solemnly put forward a comprehensive proposal welcomed by the world, but Dean continued to talk about irrelevant things in the meeting, from "Roosevelt's hometown" to "Moon Mountain watching the sea tide," from "chemical neutrality" to "modern relativity," from "the history of Thanksgiving" to "the open-air toilet in Panmunjom." The extent of its absurdity is unprecedented in the history of world diplomacy. When the US's time-consuming policy was constantly exposed and refuted by our side, Dean actually demanded in the meeting on December 12 in the tone of an ultimatum that our side sign the US's "draft proposal," and threatened: "Sign or not?" Dean seemed to have forgotten that this was a bilateral meeting, and he even used blackmailing tactics. The US government sent such a troublemaker Dean to participate in the bilateral talks to arrange the political conference, which is obviously a manifestation of not being sincere about the holding of the political conference. The US government must bear full responsibility for Dean's behavior of disrupting the bilateral talks and preventing the political conference from being held.

In order to uphold the spirit of international consultation and defend the implementation of the Korean armistice agreement, the North Korean and Chinese sides resolutely advocate continuing the bilateral talks. The representatives of North Korea and China pointed out in the statement: "Now, who is hoping to quickly convene the political conference in order to discuss the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, thereby easing the international situation, and who is trying to sabotage the political conference, so that the Korean issue cannot be peacefully resolved, so as to maintain international tension through this, the world's peace-loving people are already as clear as a fire. If the US government still has the slightest concern for the condemnation of peace-loving people, it should immediately instruct its representatives to return to the Panmunjom meeting to resume the bilateral talks. The North Korean and Chinese sides advocate continuing the bilateral talks. The US government should choose for itself whether it is willing to bear the serious responsibility for disrupting the holding of the political conference or return to Panmunjom to continue holding the bilateral talks." We believe that if the US government still has a little concern for the condemnation of peace-loving people all over the world and for its own serious responsibility for disrupting the holding of the political conference, it must send representatives to return to Panmunjom to hold talks; otherwise, it must bear the serious responsibility for disrupting the holding of the political conference.

    揭穿美方中断双方会谈的阴谋
    关于朝鲜政治会议的双方会谈已经陷于中断了。这是美方代表迪安在第二十三次会议上故意寻衅、中途退出会场、片面宣布无限期休会的蛮横行动所造成的。迪安之所以要中断会谈，其目的就是要使政治会议不得召开，以便于他们采取片面行动来强迫扣留二万余名尚未听取解释的朝中被俘人员，并保持国际紧张局势。美方利用它的特务分子的破坏活动使东场里解释工作陷于停顿之后，现在又故意寻衅使板门店的双方会谈陷于中断。迪安在中断了双方会谈后就在汉城无耻地宣称：无论政治会议是否召开，到一九五四年一月二十二日，所有未遣返的俘虏都将获得平民身份。这就把美方的阴谋计划彻头彻尾地暴露出来了。
    我方代表奇石福、黄华的联合声明有力地谴责了美方的无理行动。事实完全说明中断双方会谈无疑地是美方的预定步骤。自双方会谈开始以来，迪安就用尽了各种办法来拖延会谈的进行。当美国在第八届联合国大会上极力阻止讨论朝鲜问题，并迫使联合国大会休会的同时，板门店的美方谈判代表认为拖过联合国大会的目的已经快达到了，便更进一步积极布置破坏双方会谈。迪安在本月八日的第十九次会议上提出了一个十七点的所谓“建议草案”。在这以后，他一面宣称这是美方的“最后建议”，“将不作任何更改”，一面又扬言他“有权力随时中断预备会议”。在会场中，他始终对我方提出的问题置之不复，专门要我方在他的建议上签字。而美国的宣传机关同时又散布双方会谈即将“垮台”的空气，说什么举行政治会议的希望将“化为泡影”。接着，迪安就不顾一切地以中断谈判的行动来实行美方的预定计划，这不是非常明显的吗？
    美方提出的十七点所谓“建议草案”本来就是用以捣乱会谈的一种手法。它不仅继续坚持美方在谈判中的各种无理主张，而且在许多重要问题上比美方过去所表示的态度还倒退了。在这个“建议草案”中，美方仍然无理坚持将苏联列为朝鲜交战双方的一方参加政治会议；仍然坚持对参加政治会议的中立国的各种无理限制；并拒绝确定参加政治会议的中立国，反对确定政治会议的议程，甚至否认政治会议是双方对等会议的性质，荒谬地主张由并无朝中两国的代表参加的联合国担任政治会议的秘书机构，以及由联合国秘书长派人与双方商定政治会议的议事规则和行政安排。美方坚持和提出这些荒谬的主张，完全表明它是蓄意要扩大和增加双方会谈的分歧的。不仅如此，美方“建议草案”关于表决程序的主张，还包含着一个极端狡诈的骗局。美方一面主张单位表决，一面又坚持参加政治会议的任何国家可以不受其本身所不同意的政治会议的决议的约束。这显然是要为一直叫嚷着要破坏朝鲜和平的李承晚集团的破坏协议行为预留地步。
    美方纵容李承晚集团破坏战俘协议的背信弃义行为，是人所共知的。今年六月，在美方参加朝鲜停战谈判的哈利逊将军代表美方签订了“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的协议之后仅仅十天，李承晚集团就悍然破坏了这个协议，强迫扣留了两万七千余名我方被俘人员，而使当时即将完全达成协议的朝鲜停战几乎陷于危局。现在美方显然还在纵容李承晚集团疯狂叫嚣，一切公正人士早已不能容忍美方再设骗局而重演其破坏协议的行为。我方代表指责美方背信弃义，是完全有事实的根据的，因此是必要的。美方要想避免这种指责，只有拿出认真负责的态度，取消他们不合理的表决办法，并接受我方关于表决问题的主张，从而保证履行它对协议所应尽的义务。
    但是，美方代表迪安对我方的质问完全没有采取负责认真的态度加以澄清，反而无理取闹地大嚷大叫，说我方对美方那次背信弃义行为的指责是“侮辱”了美国政府，并以此为藉口片面地宣布中断双方会谈。然而迪安的这种藉口是极其无聊的。因为他早已公开宣布了要“随时中断谈判”，可见这是和所谓“侮辱”问题并无实际关联的。迪安说我方对美方的指责之所以是“侮辱”了美国政府，是因为我方的指责是“不确实的”。这更是一种无赖的口吻。难道李承晚集团不曾破坏“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”协议而强迫扣留了两万七千余名我方被俘人员？难道李承晚采取这一行动之前，不是连美国新闻记者都早已报道李承晚要“释放”战俘？难道在这件事情发生之后，美国记者不曾多次报道美国军队奉命不加干涉？难道说在朝鲜停战谈判中的美方谈判代表不曾代表李承晚集团？显然，迪安是无法否认这些事实的。那末，李承晚集团强迫扣留战俘的行动不是美方背信弃义的行为又是什么呢？美方的这种背信弃义行为当时曾遭受到全世界爱好和平力量的正义谴责，并曾引起美国许多盟国的不满。只是由于我方的坚持努力和全世界的正义谴责的压力，美方才对李承晚集团实施停战协定的条款作了保证。同时，由于美方并未实现克拉克将军所承诺的责任，将二万七千名战俘追回，因此，我方保留了在政治会议上提出讨论李承晚强迫扣留战俘问题的权利。这样，朝鲜停战协定才正式签订。现在，作为美方代表的迪安又有什么理由来否认这些事实呢？
    美方代表迪安在双方会谈中的所做所为，充分说明他对于全世界人民所嘱望的双方会谈采取了极端不严肃的儿戏态度，竟至于用诬蔑苏联和其他中立国以及故意歪曲我方建议的手段来代替真正的讨论。到十一月二十九日止，迪安信口开河地提出了三十四个问题，十一项“谅解”，一大堆“假设”。其中一个问题还包括十二个小问题，以制造对于实际问题的解决毫无裨益的争论。十一月三十日，我方经过周密合理的考虑，郑重提出为全世界所欢迎的全面建议之后，迪安竟继续在会谈中不着边际地东扯西拉，从“罗斯福的故乡”扯到“汶山看海潮”，从“化学上的中性”扯到“现代的相对论”，从“感恩节的历史”扯到“板门店的露天厕所”，其荒唐无稽的程度是世界外交上前所未闻的。当美方这种消磨时间的政策遭到我方的不断揭露和驳斥后，迪安竟在十二月十二日的会谈中，用最后通牒式的口吻要求我方在美方的“建议草案”上签字，并威胁说：“签还是不签？”迪安仿佛忘记了这是双方会谈，他居然用起讹诈手法来了。美国政府派了这样一个惯于捣乱的迪安来参加安排政治会议的双方会谈，显然是对于政治会议的召开并无诚意的表现。对于迪安的这种破坏双方会谈、使政治会议不得召开的行为，美国政府必须担负完全的责任。
    朝中方面为了坚持国际协商精神和捍卫朝鲜停战协定的执行，坚决主张继续双方会谈。朝中代表在声明中指出：“现在，究竟是谁在希望迅速召开政治会议，以便讨论从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队，和平解决朝鲜问题等问题，从而缓和国际局势，是谁希图破坏政治会议，使朝鲜问题不得和平解决，以便借此保持国际紧张局势，世界爱好和平人民对此已经明如观火。美国政府如果对于爱好和平人民的谴责还有丝毫顾忌，应该立即指示它的代表回到板门店会场来恢复双方会谈。朝中方面是主张继续双方会谈的。美国政府究竟是甘愿担当破坏政治会议召开的严重责任，还是回到板门店来继续举行双方会谈，应由它自己选择。”我们认为，美国政府如果对于全世界爱好和平人民的谴责和对于它自己破坏政治会议召开的严重责任还有一点顾忌的话，它就必须派遣代表重新回到板门店来举行会谈；否则，它就必须承担破坏政治会议召开的严重责任。
