Brave and Diligent Korean People

A Meeting After Victory

One evening in August, on the closing day of the National Congress of Combat Heroes of Korea, a Korean People's Army lieutenant officer, around 40 years old, led an old man of nearly 70 to the entrance of the dormitory of the People's Army heroes. He said to the guard, "Please let us meet Comrade Tian Shiyu, the anti-aircraft artillery hero."

This lieutenant officer was Tian Laiji, the father of the hero Tian Shiyu, and the old man was Tian Yilong, the hero's grandfather. They had made a special trip to see their heroic son and grandson.

Tian Laiji had been serving in the People's Army for some time. Tian Shiyu only joined the People's Army after the war broke out.

After Tian Shiyu joined the army, his grandfather Tian Yilong worked hard at home to maintain their livelihood and support the war. He toiled from dawn till dusk, and whether it was sowing, transplanting rice, harvesting, or threshing, he worked like a young man. The villagers all praised him as a diligent and glorious old grandpa.

Around July of last year, when the old man heard that his grandson Tian Shiyu had become a hero, he happily told everyone he met, "Shiyu is a good soldier of General Kim Il-sung, and a good descendant of the Tian family. He has already shot down five enemy planes." From that time on, he had been wanting to see his grandson Tian Shiyu.

He waited anxiously. Suddenly, he heard a familiar and affectionate voice calling out, "Grandpa! Dad!" Tian Shiyu had arrived, and the old man hugged his grandson in great joy. He couldn't express his love for his grandson, only saying, "You've worked hard..."

Tian Laiji praised Shiyu as if he were praising a soldier in his own company, saying, "You fought beautifully!" Tian Shiyu was so excited that he couldn't speak for a moment. After a while, he said, "Grandpa! It's such a long way, how did you get here? I was planning to come and see you!..."

They chatted under the willow trees by the Taedong River.

The grandfather talked about how he was striving for a good harvest at home to support the war and the country's reconstruction, the father talked about how his unit guarded its position, and the grandson talked about how he fought against enemy planes—by the time the war stopped, he had shot down nine enemy planes. They chatted late into the night.

Female Electric Drill Operator Che Ronggen

In a mine somewhere in Korea, rock drills were turning day and night.

Among the workers operating these rock drills was a female miner who constantly exceeded her production targets. She was Che Ronggen, the wife of People's Army soldier Zheng Yunshan.

Not long after the outbreak of the Korean War, many skilled technicians in the mines joined the army and went to the front lines. To maintain normal production in the mines and support their loved ones in battle, family members joined the mines one after another and began to learn techniques. Che Ronggen had a desire at that time to replace her husband in operating the rock drill and become a female electric drill operator. Her husband's letter was a great encouragement to her: "Dear Ronggen, in order to defend the country, I will fight until the last enemy is eliminated. To support us, you should operate that rock drill for me." One day in March 1951, Che Ronggen operated the rock drill to mine for the first time. That night, she wrote to her husband: "Zhengshan's father! You asked me in every letter to operate that rock drill for you. Now, I have it operating. Yunshan, fight bravely for the country, for peace. I guarantee to complete the production tasks in the rear and support you until the final victory. Then, we can rebuild a happy mine, a happy village, and live a pleasant peaceful life again." Thanks to her diligent study, she quickly mastered all the techniques of operating the rock drill. Now she has learned the operating methods of labor hero Kim Won-il and applied the "new specification blasting method," increasing the mining volume by 60 percent.

Production Innovator Park Jin-nyeo

In the "Gottwald Factory" somewhere in Korea, there is a female worker who has mastered high-speed cutting. Whenever someone visits, Director Li Yuankuan always stops in front of this female worker's lathe and excitedly says to the visitors, "Look! This girl is Comrade Park Jin-nyeo. She is determined to catch up with the new high-speed cutting record of the Soviet production innovator Kolesov."

Park Jin-nyeo is a petite girl of eighteen or nineteen years old. Two years ago, she was an ordinary girl who didn't understand any machines. Now she has become an advanced worker who initiated the innovation movement in this factory.

In the past, using the old cutting method, it took ten cuts to cut one millimeter. Since Park Jin-nyeo used her own new cutting method, she cut one millimeter in one cut, increasing work efficiency nine times. Now, Park Jin-nyeo is completing her production quotas every day with achievements exceeding 200 to 300 percent. Workers in all workshops in the factory are also studying her work methods and learning her techniques. A production innovation movement has been launched throughout the factory. For this reason, the factory's Party organization launched a competition to win the "Gottwald Victory Banner." The first to win this glorious banner was the Park Yong-nyeon work team. After learning Park Jin-nyeo's production innovation methods, the production level of this work team increased to 165 percent, and the cost was reduced by 8 percent.

    勇敢勤劳的朝鲜人民
    胜利后的会见
    八月某日，朝鲜全国战斗英雄大会闭幕的那天傍晚，一个四十岁左右的朝鲜人民军中尉军官，领着一位将近七十岁的老大爷，急急忙忙地赶到了人民军英雄的宿舍门口，对着哨兵说：“请让我们会见高射炮兵英雄田时雨同志。”
    这个中尉军官是英雄田时雨同志的父亲田来积，那位老大爷是英雄的祖父田益龙。他们父子俩是特地赶来看英雄的儿子和孙子的。
    田来积早就在人民军中服务。田时雨则是战争爆发以后才参加人民军的。
    田时雨参军后，祖父田益龙就在家里努力生产，维持生活和支援战争。每天起早贪黑，忙个不停，不管播种、插秧、收割、打场，他都像年轻小伙子那样劳动。村里人都称赞他是勤劳光荣的老爷爷。
    去年七月间，当老大爷听说孙子田时雨当了英雄时，他高兴得逢人就说：“时雨是金日成将军的好战士，是田家的好子孙。他已经打落了五架敌机了。”从那时他就一直想看到孙子田时雨。
    正在焦急地等待着。忽然听得熟悉而又亲切的声音在喊：“爷爷！爸爸！”田时雨来了，老大爷异常惊喜地把孙子抱在怀里。他无法表达自己对孙子的爱，只说了一句：“你辛苦了……”
    田来积好像称赞自己中队的战士那样称赞时雨道：“你打的很漂亮呀！”田时雨一时兴奋得说不出话来，过了一会才说：“爷爷！路这么远，你怎么到这里来了呢？我还准备去看爷爷哪！……”
    他们在大同江畔柳荫下畅谈起来。
    祖父谈他在家里争取丰收支援战争和国家恢复建设的情形，儿子谈他带领的那个部队守卫阵地的情形，孙子谈他如何与敌机斗争的情形—到战争停止，他已经打落九架敌机了。他们一直畅谈到深夜。
    女电镐手车荣根
    在朝鲜某地的矿山上，凿岩机日夜不停地转动着。
    在这些操纵凿岩机的工人中，有一个不断超额完成生产任务的女矿工，就是人民军战士郑允三的妻子车荣根。
    朝鲜战争爆发不久，矿山上很多熟练的技术工人，都参军上前线去了。为了维持矿上的正常生产，支援自己的亲人作战，家属们纷纷参加了矿上的生产，学起技术来。车荣根当时就有了一个愿望，要代替她的丈夫操纵凿岩机，当一名女电镐手。她丈夫的来信对她更是莫大的鼓舞：“亲爱的荣根，为了保卫祖国，我要战斗到消灭掉最后一个敌人。为了支援我们，你应该替我操纵起那架凿岩机来。”一九五一年三月里的一天，车荣根第一次开动着凿岩机采矿了。当天晚上，她给丈夫写信说：“正三的爸爸！你每次来信要我替你操纵那架凿岩机，现在，我已经把它操纵起来了。允三，为了祖国，为了和平，你英勇地战斗吧，我保证在后方完成生产任务，支援你到最后胜利。那时，我们就能重建幸福的矿山，乡村，重过愉快的和平生活了。”由于她的苦心钻研，很快就掌握了操纵凿岩机的全部技术。现在她已经学会了劳动英雄金元一的操作方法，应用了“新规格爆破法”，把采矿量增加了百分之六十。
    生产革新者朴金女
    在朝鲜某地“哥特瓦尔德工厂”里，有一个掌握了高速切削法的女工，凡是有人参观，走到这个女工的车床跟前，厂长李元宽总要停住脚步，兴奋地对参观的人说：“看！这位姑娘就是朴金女同志，她决心要赶上苏联生产革新者科列索夫的高速切削新纪录。”
    朴金女是一个个子不高的十八九岁的姑娘，两年前，她还是一个什么机器也不懂的普通女孩子，现在已经成了这个厂发起革新运动的先进工人了。
      过去，用旧的切削方法，十回才切削一公厘，自从朴金女用她自己创造的新的切削方法，一回就切削一公厘了，工作效率提高九倍。现在，朴金女正在每天以超额百分之二百到百分之三百的成就完成着生产定额。全厂各个车间的工人，也正在研究她的工作方法和学习她的技术，一个生产革新运动已在全厂展开了。为此，工厂的党组织发动了争取“哥特瓦尔德胜利旗”的竞赛运动。第一个获得这面光荣旗子的是朴永年工作班。这个工作班在学习了朴金女生产革新的方法后，生产水平提高到百分之一百六十五，成本减低了百分之八。
