Introducing the Experiences of Qin County, Tai'an and Other Places in Closely Integrating Production and Grain Purchase
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Yan Ling

All the policies of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government are, in the final analysis, for the purpose of developing the productive forces and improving the people's material and cultural living standards. The purpose of mobilizing farmers to sell their surplus grain to the state, an important measure, is of course also like this. Only if it can achieve such a goal, does it conform to the interests of the state and the interests of the masses. We should regard the grain purchase process as a process of linking the farmers and the government, the working class more closely, and as a process of mobilizing farmers to cooperate with each other and expand production.

Qin County in Shanxi Province, Hao Peiying's mutual aid team in Tai'an, Shandong Province, Tang Xiexie's mutual aid team in Hengshan, Hunan Province, and Xiang Peisheng's mutual aid team in Suining, Sichuan Province, all summarized this year's production and planned for next year's increased production, which enhanced everyone's enthusiasm for production. Under the excitement of actively requesting increased production, they sold their surplus grain to the state, and then immediately invested the money from selling the grain into production, striving for a better harvest next year. These are all good examples of closely integrating grain purchase work with expanding production. Such things happen in both old and new areas. However, the rules they show are consistent: 1. Grain purchase work should not and cannot be carried out in isolation from production; 2. If the enthusiasm of farmers for production is improved, farmers will be willing to sell grain to the state; 3. If the grain purchase work is done well, it will not only not hinder the enthusiasm of farmers for production, but also improve the enthusiasm of farmers for production.

From the perspective of the completion of grain purchase tasks in these places, three important experiences can be put forward:

1.  Start with summarizing and evaluating this year's production achievements and arranging next year's production, so that the masses can understand why production has increased or decreased this year, why it is necessary to continue to increase production next year, whether it can be increased further, and how to increase it further. After doing this, the masses have understood that increasing production is inseparable from the help of the state, inseparable from mutual assistance and cooperation, and inseparable from expanding investment and improving technology; they understand that they need to continue to work hard to increase production for the country and for themselves; they know that the reason for not increasing production much or reducing production is that the mutual assistance and cooperation organizations have not been run well or have not participated in mutual assistance and cooperation organizations, there is not enough strength to improve technology and fight against natural disasters, and there is no expansion of production investment; they also know that it is very possible to further increase production and improve living standards. After Shangguan Village in Qin County introduced the experience of Li Fuyun Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dongzhuang Village in producing three stones of grain per mu, old man Zhang Shuiming said: "Our livestock is not good and there is little fertilizer, so each mu only yielded a little more than one stone; this year is considered a mistake, next year we will also replace it with better livestock and increase some fertilizer." After the enthusiasm for production was developed, the farmers in various townships immediately sold a large amount of grain to the supply and marketing cooperatives and ordered production materials. A small mountain village with three households sold sixty stones of grain in order to develop animal husbandry. After the Tai'an working group arrived in Shanggao Township, they first conducted a production summary and evaluation in the Hao Peiying mutual aid team in conjunction with winter production. Through summarizing the whole year's production, the team members realized that because of the leadership and help of the Party and the government, although they suffered various disasters this year, the average yield per mu still increased by more than 35 jin compared with last year, and 10% to 20% more than individual farmers. In the evaluation, active members and models of labor mutual assistance were selected, examples of progress were set up, and key points for increasing production such as soil improvement were found. The team members' interest in increasing production was further improved. At the same time, in summarizing and evaluating the whole year's production, it was natural to understand who were surplus grain households, how much surplus they had; who were self-sufficient households, whether they could sell some or not; and who were grain-deficient households, how much they lacked. There was also a more specific understanding of the ideological situation of each household. In this way, blind action can be avoided, policies can be grasped more properly, and ideological education can be carried out more practically according to different situations to dispel concerns and improve awareness. Some places calculated next year's production household by household after the evaluation. How much grain was harvested this year, how much to eat, how much is left, what to buy to increase production and improve living standards, and how much grain to sell to buy these things were all carefully planned. In this way, everyone smoothly reported their grain sales plans. Some people were originally afraid that if they sold grain, they would have nowhere to spend the money and would not be able to buy anything back; after making plans for increasing production, their thinking became clear. Rich middle peasant Xu Zongsheng said: "Now my thinking is clear, which is more pleasant than taking medicine. I calculated that I can sell 1,600 jin of grain, add a pig, buy a walking plow, and buy some fertilizer. This way, production will be better, which is both patriotic and good for myself, how good!" The Tang Xiexie mutual aid team in Hengshan held a meeting to summarize the harvest not long after the autumn harvest was completed. Team member Zhou Hesheng said: "My field only had early rice, which increased production by 18% compared to last year, and late rice can yield more than three stones of rice. Last year, there was a shortage of food for two months, but this year there is still a stone of rice left. It is true that with the leadership of the Communist Party, our lives are getting better and better." Other team members also calculated carefully. This year, the whole team of sixty mu of land can harvest an average of 640 jin of rice per mu, which is a great improvement compared to last year. After such a calculation, everyone's enthusiasm for production was boosted. They said: "Our team still lacks plowing cattle and farm tools. To expand production, we must add them." Then everyone understood the principle of selling rice to the country, and quickly gathered more than 3,000 jin of grain and took it to the cooperative. This year, the grain output of Xiang Peisheng mutual aid team in Suining County increased by 23.2% compared to last year. In October, Xiang Peisheng held a general meeting of team members and proposed the issue of how to continue to increase grain production next year for everyone to discuss. Everyone spoke very enthusiastically. Some said that they would continue to learn from advanced experience, and some said that they would prepare enough fertilizer. Then everyone checked the preparations made for next spring's grain production increase: the team had only prepared 1,300 jin of oil cake for spring fertilizer, and four households had not bought any oil cake at all; one of the three plowing cattle in the team was already old; in addition, some farm tools had not been repaired. This made the team members feel that if they did not seize the opportunity to prepare, next year's production increase would be in vain. After discussion, it was felt that 4,000 jin of oil cake, 400 jin of bone meal should be purchased immediately, and a strong ox should also be bought. To buy these things, the surplus grain must be sold. Xiang Peisheng then guided everyone to discuss the benefits of selling the surplus grain to the country for the country and for themselves. Everyone's minds were clear, and their enthusiasm for patriotism and increasing production was high. A total of 17,600 jin of grain was sold to the country.

2.  Closely link increasing production and selling grain with the country's general line, so that the masses can further understand that farmers can have greater happiness only if the country is industrialized, and understand that farmers can become rich together only if agriculture is undergoing socialist transformation; in order to achieve industrialization and socialist transformation, it is necessary to increase production and sell grain to the country. When the Tai'an working group helped the Hao Peiying mutual aid team summarize and evaluate production achievements, they initially proposed to sell surplus grain to the state. Some team members could not turn the corner ideologically for a while, and their enthusiasm declined, resulting in a stalemate of pretending to be sick and shirking responsibility. Although they had also generally publicized the general line, it had not really penetrated people's hearts and had not been closely integrated with the production and life of the masses, so it could not dispel the masses' ideological concerns about selling grain. The working group immediately checked the shortcomings in their work, found the root cause, and then vigorously and deeply explained to the masses what is socialism, how to transition to socialism, made it clear the relationship between industrial construction and agriculture, distinguished the two roads in the countryside; after repeated publicity, they also held a forum to let everyone think about the past, look at the present, and look forward to the future. In this way, national construction, the future of the countryside, and the individual's production and life were all linked together. Team member Xing Yuzhu said: "In the past, ten jin of wheat could only buy two chi of cloth, but now it can buy four chi. This year, our team bought more than 2,000 jin of chemical fertilizer, which guaranteed the increase in crop production. There are so many benefits to industrial development." Deputy team leader Xu Zongsheng said: "If everyone sells grain to the country, they will no longer be exploited by grain hoarders. When I was short of food last year, I borrowed 100 jin of corn from a grain hoarder, and returned 150 jin of wheat less than twenty days after the wheat was harvested. This interest is worse than murder!" Hao Junying said: "The prices of unscrupulous merchants rise with the wind. Last month, a seller of oil heard that the supply and marketing cooperative had run out of oil, and raised the price three times in less than two hours, from 6,000 yuan to 8,000 yuan. It is really important to sell grain to the country to stabilize prices." Hao Peiying said: "I am the team leader, and I didn't take the lead early, but I became a stumbling block, which is really wrong. The day before yesterday, my son wrote from Korea, asking me to produce well. He is a model on the front line and challenges me; we organized a mutual aid team and increased production. This is all thanks to Chairman Mao's good leadership. I am really sorry to Chairman Mao. Now I have figured it out and guarantee to sell 1,200 jin of grain to the country, and my spirits are also refreshed." After the Nanli Township Party Branch in Qin County understood the ideological concerns of the masses, they also combined the socialist road, the benefits of industrialization to farmers, and grain purchase and increased production to publicize the various ideas of the masses; every household talked about this issue. Everyone calculated horizontally and vertically, and in any case, it was still better to sell surplus grain to the country. In this way, the enthusiasm for production was further improved, and grain was sold more consciously to expand production investment. From these past situations, it seems that when publicizing the general line, it is necessary to publicize how to carry out socialist transformation of agriculture, as well as the relationship between national industrialization and farmers. Neither can be neglected.

3.  After the masses sell grain, continue to mobilize the masses to work hard to increase production and develop mutual assistance and cooperation.

The first important thing after grain purchase is to make the masses consciously use as much of the money they get from selling grain as possible to expand production. The Hao Peiying mutual aid team in Tai'an paid attention to this issue. After selling the surplus grain, they made a plan to use this money to expand production and appropriately improve living standards. In addition to repaying more than 1.13 million yuan of bank loans, they wanted to buy five pigs, 250 jin of chemical fertilizer, 1,000 jin of soybean cake, three manure baskets, a walking plow, 2,000 jin of cattle grass, and also buy some daily necessities such as soybean oil, kerosene, salt, cloth, and cotton; the remaining money was deposited in the credit cooperative, on the one hand, to help households in difficulty expand production, and on the other hand, they could also get appropriate interest. They solved some problems within the team through a team member meeting, revised the winter production increase and savings plan, and immediately took active action to hoe wheat, topdress fertilizer, water wheat, push mat soil in the pen, and accumulate fertilizer. The Tang Xiexie mutual aid team in Hengshan County also immediately bought two plowing cattle and four sets of plows after selling grain, and built a cowshed. All the male and female team members joyfully engaged in winter production. After selling the surplus grain, the Xiang Peisheng mutual aid team in Suining County had bought 1,300 jin of oil cake and other fertilizers, added ten items such as plowshares and hoes, replaced a strong ox, and added six pigs. The remaining money is also planned to buy an ox and buy another 4,000 jin of oil cake and 400 jin of bone meal fertilizer from the supply and marketing cooperative. They are doing the right thing. Some farmers cannot use up the money immediately after selling grain, or it is not enough to buy livestock and large farm tools. They deposit it in the bank or cooperative and plan to buy fertilizer, pesticides, seeds, etc. before next spring plowing, or accumulate it into a whole number to buy livestock and large farm tools, and they can also get interest themselves. This is also very good and should be encouraged.

After the masses understand the socialist road, the enthusiasm for mutual assistance and cooperation has surged. The Hao Peiying mutual aid team in Tai'an is actively brewing to establish an agricultural production cooperative, and five households have already fully agreed. Li Qingshui in Nan Di Shui Township, Qin County, sold 4,700 jin of surplus grain, most of which was used to expand production; influenced by them, the township sold more than 20,000 jin of grain in total. The masses said: Agricultural production cooperatives have "great ability, produce more grain, sell more grain, buy more things, and will definitely produce more grain next year." Therefore, the mutual aid team is more consolidated, and many people also plan to join the agricultural production cooperative. With a clear vision of the road to increasing production and common prosperity, the idea of hoarding grain and waiting to get rich has been dispelled. We must cherish the enthusiasm for mutual assistance and cooperation that has surged up among the masses, guide it correctly, and actively provide assistance. It should be noted that although the masses' enthusiasm for mutual assistance and cooperation has surged, the experience of mutual assistance and cooperation, especially the experience of running production cooperatives, is insufficient. If it is not guided and helped, the masses' enthusiasm for mutual assistance and cooperation may be frustrated. We should "strike while the iron is hot" and not lose the opportunity; nor should we be overwhelmed by enthusiasm.

These facts all show that grain purchase work cannot be carried out in isolation, but should and can be combined with mobilizing the masses to produce and helping the masses to produce. According to the experiences and lessons of Qin County and other places, in order to mobilize the masses to expand production investment, the supply of production materials must also be done well. The economic work in grain purchase work in many places is lagging behind the political work, and the greatest efforts should be made to catch up. If this work is not done well, the mobilization to expand production will still be in vain.

    介绍沁县泰安等地紧密结合生产做好购粮工作的经验
    燕凌
    中国共产党和人民政府的一切政策，归根结底，都是为了发展生产力、提高人民的物质和文化生活水平。动员农民把余粮卖给国家，这一项重大的措施的目的当然也是这样的。只有能达到这样的目的，才符合国家的利益，也才符合群众的利益。我们应当把购粮的过程当作把农民和政府、工人阶级更紧密地联系起来的过程，当作动员农民互助合作、扩大生产的过程。
    山西沁县许多乡、山东泰安郝培英互助组、湖南衡山唐协偕互助组、四川遂宁向培生互助组，都从总结今年生产和计划明年增产中提高了大家的生产积极性，在积极要求增加生产的热情激动下把余粮卖给了国家，紧接着就把卖粮的钱投入生产，争取明年更好的丰收。这些都是把购粮工作和扩大生产密切结合起来的好榜样。这样的事情，有的发生在老区，有的发生在新区。可是，它们表现出来的规律是一致的：1．购粮工作不应也不能离开生产孤立地进行；2．提高了农民的生产积极性，农民就愿意把粮食卖给国家；3．购粮工作做得好，不但不会妨碍农民的生产积极性，而且能提高农民的生产积极性。
    从这些地方完成购粮任务的情况来看，可以提出三条重要的经验：
    一、从总结评比今年的生产成绩和安排明年的生产入手，使群众了解今年为什么增产或者减产，为什么明年需要继续增加生产，能不能再增加生产，怎样再增加生产。这样做了以后，群众都了解了增加生产和国家的帮助是分不开的，和互助合作是分不开的，和扩大投资、改进技术是分不开的；明白了为国家为自己都需要继续努力增产；知道了增产不多或者减产的原因是没有把互助合作组织办好或者没有参加互助合作组织，没有足够的力量改进技术、和自然灾害作斗争，没有扩大生产投资；也知道了再进一步增加生产和改善生活是有很大可能性的。沁县上官村介绍了东庄李富云农业生产合作社每亩地产粮三石的经验以后，张水明老汉就说：“咱的牲口不好，肥料少，因此每亩地只打了一石多；今年算是误了，明年咱也换个好牲口，多增加些肥料。”生产积极性发扬起来以后，各乡农民马上就把大批粮食卖到供销合作社，订购生产资料。有一个三户人家的小山庄，为了发展畜牧，就卖出六十石粮食。泰安工作组到了上高乡以后，首先在郝培英互助组结合冬季生产进行了生产总结评比。通过总结全年生产，组员们都认识到因为有了党和政府的领导帮助，今年虽然遭受种种灾害，平均每亩地的产量仍比去年增加了三十五斤多，比单干农民多百分之十到二十。在评比中，选出了劳动互助的积极分子和模范，树立了前进的榜样，找出了改良土壤等增产关键，组员们增产的兴趣更加提高了。同时，在总结评比全年生产中，很自然地就了解了那些是余粮户，可余多少；那些是自足自给户，能卖一些不能；那些是缺粮户，缺多少。对各户的思想情况也有了比较具体的了解。这样，就可以避免盲动，能更妥善地掌握政策，也能更切合实际地针对不同情况进行思想教育，解除顾虑，提高觉悟。有的地方在评比后以户为单位盘算明年的生产。今年打了多少粮，要吃多少，剩下多少，要增加生产、改善生活得买些什么东西，要买这些东西得卖多少粮食，都打算周到了。这样，大家就顺利地报出了自己的卖粮计划。有的人原先怕卖了粮食钱没处花，买不回东西来；作了增产的打算以后，思想就通了。富裕中农徐宗圣说：“现在我思想通了，比吃付药还痛快。我算了算能卖一千六百斤粮食，添一口猪，买一张步犁，再买些肥料。这样生产得更好，又是爱国，又对自己好，多好哇！”衡山唐协偕互助组在秋收完毕以后不久就开了一个总结丰收的会。组员周和生说：“我的田只是早稻就比去年全年增产了一成八，晚稻还能再收三石多谷子。去年差两个月口粮，今年还能剩石把谷子。真是有了共产党的领导，我们的日子就越过越好。”别的组员也都细细地算了一下，全组六十亩田今年平均每亩能收六百四十斤谷子，比去年大大提高了。这样一算，大家的生产劲头就鼓起来了。他们说：“我们组里还缺少耕牛、农具。要扩大生产，就一定要添置。”接着大家又弄通了把谷子卖给国家的道理，很快就集中了三千多斤粮食，挑到合作社去了。遂宁县向培生互助组今年粮食产量比去年增加了百分之二十三点二。十月间，向培生召开了一次组员大会，提出明年怎样继续增产粮食的问题让大家讨论。大家发言很踊跃，有的说要继续学习先进经验，有的说要准备足够的肥料。接着大家就检查了一下为明春粮食增产所作的准备：全组的大春肥料只准备了一千三百斤油枯，其中有四户一点油枯也没买；全组三头耕牛有一头已经老了；另外，有些农具还没有整修。这就使组员们感觉到要是再不抓紧准备，明年的增产就要落空。经过商量，觉得应立即再购买油枯四千斤，骨粉四百斤，还得买一条壮牛。要买到这些东西，就要把余粮卖出去。向培生这时就引导大家讨论了把余粮卖给国家对国家对自己的好处。大家的心眼都亮了，爱国增产的情绪很高，总共卖给国家一万七千六百斤粮食。
    二、把增产卖粮和国家的总路线密切地联系起来，使群众更进一步了解国家工业化了农民才能有更大的幸福，了解只有对农业进行社会主义改造农民才能共同富裕；为了工业化和社会主义改造都必须增产，必须把粮食卖给国家。泰安工作组在郝培英互助组帮助总结评比生产成绩的时候，一开始就提出要把余粮卖给国家，有些组员的思想上的弯子一时转不过来，情绪就低落了，出现了装病、推诿的僵局。他们虽然也曾一般地宣传了总路线，但还没有真正渗透人心，还没有和群众的生产、生活紧密结合起来，因此不能解除群众卖粮的思想顾虑。工作组马上检查了工作中的缺点，找到了病根，就大张旗鼓地、深入地向群众讲解了什么是社会主义、怎样过渡到社会主义，讲清楚了工业建设和农业的关系，分清了农村的两条道路；反复地宣传之后，又召开座谈会让大家想想过去，看看现在，望望将来。这样一来，就把国家建设、农村前途和个人的生产、生活都连到一块了。组员邢玉柱说：“过去十斤麦子才买二尺布，现在能买四尺。今年咱组共买化学肥料二千多斤，才保证了庄稼增产。工业发展了，好处真多。”副组长徐宗圣说：“大家都把粮食卖给国家，以后可不再受囤粮户的剥削了。我去年青黄不接的时候向囤粮户借了一百斤玉米，不到二十天麦子打下来了还了一百五十斤麦子。这利钱比杀人都厉害！”郝俊英说：“奸商的物价见风就涨。上月有个卖油的听到供销合作社没了油，不到两个钟头就涨了三次价，从六千元涨到八千元。把粮食卖给国家稳定物价实在要紧。”郝培英说：“我是组长，没有早带头，还成了挡头，真是不应该。前天我儿子从朝鲜来信，要我好好生产，他在前方当模范和我挑战；我们组织互助组，增产了，这全是毛主席领导得好。我真对不起毛主席。现在我想通了，保证卖一千二百斤粮食给国家，精神也爽快了。”沁县南里乡党支部了解了群众的思想顾虑以后，也针对群众的各种思想把社会主义的道路、工业化对农民的好处和购粮、增产结合起来进行了宣传；家家户户都谈论起这个问题来了。大家横算竖算，怎么说也还是把余粮卖给国家好。这样，就更提高了生产积极性，更自觉地卖粮扩大生产投资了。从这些经过情形看来，在宣传总路线的时候，既要宣传对农业如何进行社会主义改造，也要宣传国家工业化和农民的关系，两者是不可偏废的。
    三、群众卖粮以后，要继续动员群众努力增加生产，发展互助合作。
    购粮以后头一件要紧事就是要使群众自觉地把卖粮所得的钱尽可能多用在扩大生产上。泰安郝培英互助组注意了这个问题，在卖出余粮后就订出了使用这笔钱扩大生产、适当改善生活的计划，除归还银行贷款一百一十三万多元以外，要买五口猪，二百五十斤化学肥料，一千斤豆饼，三个粪筐，一张步犁，二千斤牛草，还要买些豆油、煤油、盐、布、棉花等日用必需品；其余的款都存到信用合作社里去，一方面帮助困难户扩大生产，一方面还可得到适当的利息。他们通过组员大会解决了组内的一些问题，修订了冬季增产节约计划，马上积极行动起来，锄麦、追肥、浇麦、推垫圈土、积肥，热烘烘地干起来了。衡山县唐协偕互助组卖粮后也立即买了两头耕牛、四套犁、砌了一间牛栏，全组男女组员都欢天喜地地搞起冬季生产来了。遂宁县向培生互助组卖出余粮后已买了一千三百斤油枯和别的肥料，添置了犁头、锄头等十件，换了一头壮牛，添了六只猪。剩下的钱还准备买一头牛，向供销合作社再买四千斤油枯、四百斤骨粉肥料。他们这样做，就完全做对了。有些农民卖粮以后钱一时用不完或者还不够买牲口和大件农具，存到银行或者合作社里，打算明年春耕前再买肥料、农药、种籽等等，或者积成个整数好买牲口和大农具，自己还能得到利息，这也是很好的，应当鼓励群众这样做。
    群众明白了社会主义的道路以后，互助合作的积极性高涨起来了。泰安郝培英互助组正积极酝酿成立农业生产合作社，有五户已经全家赞成。沁县南底水乡李庆水卖了余粮四千七百斤，大部用到扩大生产上了；全乡受他们的影响，总共卖了两万多斤粮食。群众都说：农业生产合作社“本事大，产粮多，卖粮多，买东西多，明年增产粮食一定更多”。因此，互助组更巩固了，许多人还打算参加农业生产合作社。看准了增加生产、共同富裕的大路，囤粮等着发财的想法就打消了。我们一定要十分珍视群众中间高涨起来的互助合作的积极性，正确地加以引导，积极地给以帮助。应该注意到，群众的互助合作积极性虽然高涨了，互助合作的经验、特别是办生产合作社的经验是不足的。如果不加以引导、给以帮助，群众的互助合作的积极性就可能受挫折。应当“趁热打铁”，不可失去时机；也不可被热情冲昏头脑。
    这些事实都说明了：购粮工作不能孤立地进行，而应该也完全可能和动员群众生产、帮助群众生产结合起来。根据沁县等地的经验教训，要动员群众扩大生产投资，还必须把生产资料供应工作做好。现在很多地方的购粮工作中的经济工作是落后于政治工作的，应当尽最大努力赶上去。不把这个工作做好，扩大生产的动员还是会落空的。
