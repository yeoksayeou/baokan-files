    Old Stone Age Human Cultural Site and Relics Discovered in Fencheng County, Shanxi

    An Old Stone Age human cultural site and relics have been discovered in the Dingcun area of Fencheng County, Shanxi Province. These were discovered by a construction team working on a project in the area in May of this year. Among the relics are many large stone flakes that were artificially struck and show signs of use. According to archaeologists, these relics are undoubtedly tools used by humans during the Old Stone Age. Stone shovels, pottery, and other items used by humans during the New Stone Age were also discovered in this area. In the past, few Old Stone Age human sites have been discovered in our country, and most of them were excavated by imperialist elements through theft and plunder. This discovery marks the first time that our working people have made such a find. Archaeologists believe that the excavation work in Fencheng will provide extremely valuable data for future research into the origins and development of human history. In order to further investigate and study ancient humans and their culture, relevant departments of the People's Government are planning to conduct further investigations and excavations in the Dingcun area of Fencheng County.

    A New and Well-Equipped Hospital Established in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region

    The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region People's Government has established a relatively well-equipped hospital in Chang'an Town – the Chang'an Branch of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region People's Hospital – which officially opened in late October. The establishment of this hospital will greatly facilitate medical treatment for the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region, including the Sanjiang Dong Autonomous Region, the D苗 Mountains Miao Autonomous Region, and counties such as Rong'an and Luocheng.

    In the four months from the start of outpatient services to the official opening, the hospital has treated more than 10,000 people. Many people suffering from long-term parasitic diseases and other difficult and complicated diseases have been cured. A Zhuang woman from Rong'an County, who had been suffering from hookworm disease for five or six years, was pale and emaciated, deaf, and had abdominal pain. After the district head introduced her to the hospital for free treatment, the hookworms were eliminated, and she was hospitalized for more than 50 days. She has now recovered. The hospital has spacious outpatient departments and wards, with departments of internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, and obstetrics and gynecology. Currently, 70 to 80 people to 150 to 160 people come to the hospital for treatment every day.

    山西汾城县发现旧石器时代人类文化遗址和遗物
    山西省汾城县丁村一带发现了旧石器时代的人类文化遗址和遗物，这是今年五月在该地进行建设的工程队发现的。遗物中有许多人工打击而成的巨大石片，并有使用的痕迹。据考古学家观察，这些遗物都无疑地是属于旧石器时代人类使用的工具。在这一带地区还发现了新石器时代人类使用的石铲、陶器等物。旧石器时代人类的遗址，我国过去发现的不多，且大部分是帝国主义分子用盗窃掠夺的方式所发掘的。这次是我国劳动人民第一次的发现。考古学家相信：汾城的发掘工作将给今后研究人类历史的起源和发展提供极宝贵的资料。为了进一步考察和研究古代人类及其文化，人民政府有关部门正计划在汾城县丁村一带地区作进一步的调查和发掘工作。
    桂西僮族自治区新建立了一所设备较完善的医院
    桂西僮族自治区人民政府，在长安镇建立的一所设备比较完善的医院——桂西僮族自治区人民医院长安分院，已在十月下旬正式开幕。这所医院的建立，对自治区境内的三江侗族自治区、大苗山苗族自治区和融安、罗城等县各族人民医疗疾病，带来很大便利。
    医院从开始门诊到正式开幕的四个月中，已治疗了一万多人次，有许多患着长期寄生虫病和其他疑难病症的人，都给治好了。融安县僮族一个妇女患钩虫寄生病五、六年，面黄肌瘦，耳聋肚痛，经区长介绍她到医院免费治疗后，打下了钩虫，并住院五十多天，现在身体已经复原了。医院设有宽敞的门诊部、病房，共有内科、外科和小儿、妇产各科，现在每天有七八十人到一百五六十人到医院治病。
