Supporting National Construction, Our Group Sold More Than 20,000 Jin of Surplus Grain
Oral Account by Weng Zhenxiang, Head of the Wengjiazhuang Mutual Aid Team, Chang'an County, Shaanxi

    Our mutual aid team had a really good harvest this year, the best we’ve seen in many years. If it weren't for the Communist Party and the People's Government leading us to organize, lending us waterwheels and farm tools, and teaching us techniques, it would have been very difficult to have such a bountiful harvest. Now that the country is engaged in large-scale construction and needs a large amount of grain, we are called upon to sell our surplus grain. However, some members of our group only see the immediate benefits, calculating only for themselves. Some said, "Let's hold onto the wheat for now, and see if the price goes up later." Others said, "We've harvested so much wheat, we can't eat it all, we can't use it all. If we lend some out, wouldn't we make more money!" I said that this kind of thinking was wrong, that they were "penny-wise, pound-foolish," but they wouldn't listen. They said, "This grain is the product of our sweat; we should do whatever gets us the most money!" Weng Zhengying, a member of our group, is a member of the Communist Youth League and also the secretary of the Youth League branch in the township. I consulted with him and we decided that we had to get the group members to see the bigger picture and understand their relationship with the country.

    One day, we held a meeting to let everyone talk about how these good days came about and how we can live even better lives. Weng Zhenggang said, "I have never harvested such good crops as this year. The year before last, my 8.7 mu of land yielded a little more than ten *shi* of grain. Last year, it yielded fourteen or fifteen *shi*, and this year it yielded twenty *shi*. In the past, I had no livestock, not even a plow. Now I have an ox and I have also acquired a plow. My life is like climbing a ladder, each rung higher than the last." Then he added, "If it weren't for the Communist Party and the People's Government distributing land to us and helping us to organize and develop production, we would never be able to live such a life. When we lack something in production, the government provides loans to help; when there are disasters, the government distributes grain for relief; seeing that our 'Lan Hua' wheat seeds didn’t germinate well, they gave us 'Bima No. 1' wheat seeds to replace them; when the old techniques weren’t working, they taught us rational close planting and rational fertilization. Everyone, tell me, if it weren't for this, could we harvest so much grain?" Weng Zhenggang spoke in one breath, reminding everyone that we must not forget all these benefits from the state! Weng Zhengfang said, "To be honest, if it weren't for the Communist Party and the People's Government, we would not have such a life today."

    As everyone talked, they remembered that industrial products have become cheaper year by year. Weng Renjie said, "In the old society, there were no factories serving us farmers. At that time, it was difficult to buy things for farming even at high prices; but the things we produced in the fields were dirt cheap…" Weng Zhengying quickly followed up, "At that time, I remember that a broken rake took a long time to buy, and when you found one, it was still incredibly expensive. Now there are many rakes, and the price is fair."

    As everyone talked about this, I also thought about my clothes. In the year of the liberation, one *chi* of Qinyanta cloth cost 6,300 yuan. To make a set of clothes, it cost 94,500 yuan, equivalent to more than ninety *jin* of wheat. This autumn, when I bought Qinyanta cloth again, it was half the price, 3,150 yuan per *chi*. A set of clothes cost 47,250 yuan, equivalent to only 45 *jin* of wheat. The price is so much cheaper that a set of clothes saves me more than forty *jin* of wheat. You see how much of a benefit this is for farmers! After saying this, everyone understood another principle: when industry is developed, the things we use become cheaper, and one *qian* can be worth several *qian*.

    Weng Zhengfang said, "Speaking of prices, in the past, prices went up and down, and farmers suffered a lot. Let's not even mention the old society. In the year of liberation, profiteers were still disrupting the market, and prices changed several times a month. One day, selling one *dou* of wheat could be exchanged for four *jin* of salt, but when prices fluctuated, the next day it could only buy two *jin* of salt." Weng Zhenwei also said, "The price of rapeseed oil in the cooperative is always 5,800 yuan, and it has remained stable. After the wheat harvest, the cooperative didn't have time to stock up, and the profiteers took the opportunity to raise the price of oil to 6,400 yuan, exploiting us. If the cooperative can stock up, we are guaranteed not to suffer a loss." Weng Junjie originally planned to sell the wheat after the price rose, but later he understood the principle and sold it to the country. He said, "Price stability is so beneficial to us farmers that we must sell our surplus grain to the country. If the country has enough grain and other things, prices can be stable."

    Weng Renjie said, "Storing grain at home affects national construction and also delays our own expansion of production, which is not worthwhile at all." He also calculated his own account. He said, "If I sell my remaining 2,000 *jin* of wheat, I can exchange it for a waterwheel, which can turn dry land into paddy fields. The yield per *mu* can go from eight *dou* to three *shi*. Even with a normal harvest, after deducting the capital, I can still earn an additional eight or nine thousand *jin* of grain! You see, this way I can harvest more grain myself and also support national construction. It's really doing two things with one *qian*!"

    After our group had this discussion, the reasoning became clear and our enthusiasm increased. This year, all eleven households in the group harvested a total of 50,000 *jin* of grain, and this time, we sold more than 20,000 *jin* of surplus grain to the country. We bought back two head of livestock, two waterwheels, and more than fifty hoes, spades, and rakes, in addition to buying other daily necessities. (Recorded by Dong Shu)

    支援国家建设，咱组卖出两万多斤余粮
    陕西长安县翁家庄互助组组长  翁振祥  口述
    我们互助组今年的收成真好，多少年来都没有见过。这样的年成，要不是共产党、人民政府领导咱们组织起来，贷放水车、农具，教给技术，要想有这样的丰收，那真是难得很。现在国家正在大建设，需要大批的粮食，号召我们出卖余粮。可是我们组里一些组员，光看到个人鼻子底下那点利益，自己打了小算盘。有的说：“麦子先放放吧，以后看涨哩。”有的说：“打下这么多麦，吃不了，用不了，要是放点账，不是多落几个钱！”我说这号想法不对，“抓了芝麻，丢了西瓜”，他们也不听。他们说：“粮食是咱用汗浇出来的，怎能多得钱就怎办！”我们组里翁正英是个青年团员，又是全乡的团支部书记，我就跟他商量，研究到要让组员看远点，一定要每个人弄清跟国家的关系。
    这天，我们开了个会，让大家谈谈好日子是怎样来的，怎样才能过更好的日子。翁振刚说：“我从来就没收过像今年这样好的庄稼，前年我那八亩七分地收了十石多粮食，去年就收到十四、五石，今年收了二十石。从前我没牲口，连个犁也没有。现在我有了一头牛、犁也置下了，我这日子就跟上梯子一样，一磴比一磴高。”接着他又说：“没有共产党、人民政府给咱分土地，帮助组织起来，发展生产，怎么也过不成这样的日子。生产上缺啥，政府给贷款帮助；有了灾荒，政府发粮救济；看咱兰花麦种打头轻，给咱换了碧蚂一号麦种；旧技术不行，又教给合理密植、合理施肥。大家说说吧，要不是这样，咱能打这么多粮？”翁振刚一口气说下去，把大家提醒了，国家这些好处怎能忘掉！翁振芳说：“说实话，要没共产党、人民政府，咱们就不会有今天这样的日子。”
    大家谈着谈着，想起这几年的工业品，也是一年比一年便宜了。翁仁杰说：“旧社会里，没有给咱庄稼人服务的工厂。那时候，做庄稼用的东西花大价都难买；咱们地里出的东西可贱透了，……”翁振英紧跟着说：“那时候我记得一个包耙用烂了，买了好久买不到，碰上一个还贵得不行。现在包耙可多了，价也公道了。”
    大家说到这里，我也想起我缝衣服的事。刚解放的那年，一尺青雁塔布得六千三百元。缝一身衣服，得九万四千五百元，合九十多斤麦子。今年秋里，我再买雁塔布，就便宜了一半，一尺三千一百五十元，缝一身四万七千二百五十元，只合麦子四十五斤，物价这么一便宜，一身衣服省下了四十多斤麦子。你看对庄稼人有多大好处！这么一说，大家又懂了一个道理，就是工业发达了，咱用的东西就便宜，一个钱就能顶几个钱用。
    翁振芳说：“说起物价，过去物价一起一落，庄稼人不知吃了多少亏。旧社会就不说它了。刚解放那年，奸商还在捣乱市场，物价一个月得变动几次。先一天卖一斗麦能换四斤盐，物价一波动，第二天只能买二斤多盐了。”翁振威还说：“合作社的菜油老是五千八百元，一直稳定着哩，麦收后，合作社一时没来得及进货，奸商钻空子，一下把油价提到六千四百元，把咱剥削了。合作社要是进来货，咱保险吃不了亏。”翁俊杰原来也是打算麦子涨价再卖，后来想通了道理，便卖给国家了。他说：“物价稳定对咱庄稼人有这么大的好处，咱们就得把余粮卖给国家。国家有了足够的粮食和别的东西，物价就能稳定。”
    翁仁杰说：“把粮食存在家里，影响了国家建设，还耽误了自己扩大生产，怎么也不合算。”他还给自己算了个账，他说：“我把余下的两千多斤小麦卖掉，换回一辆水车，能把旱地变成水地，每亩能从八斗的产量，打到三石。就是一般收成，除了本，一共还能多收入八、九千斤粮哩！你们看，这样自己多打了粮，还支援了国家建设，真是一个钱办了两个钱的事！”
    我们组里这样一讨论，道理搞通了，劲头也大了。全组十一户，今年一共打了五万斤粮，这一回，就把两万多斤余粮卖给了国家。一共买回来两头牲口、两辆水车，还有镢头、锨、包耙五十多件，另外还有买别的日用品的。   （董墅记）
