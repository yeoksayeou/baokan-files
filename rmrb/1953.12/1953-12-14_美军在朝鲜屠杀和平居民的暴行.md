US Military Atrocities Against Peaceful Residents in Korea
By Huang Guijin, Editor-in-Chief of the "Rodong Sinmun"

The American imperialists, attempting to turn our country into their colony, enslave our people, and use our country as a springboard to invade China and the Soviet Union, launched the war of aggression against Korea. For more than three years, the Korean people, with the support and solidarity of the people of socialist and people's democratic countries headed by the Soviet Union and all freedom-loving and peace-loving people around the world, have overcome all difficulties, displayed unprecedented heroism, self-sacrifice, and tenacious perseverance, and waged an indomitable and arduous struggle. Finally, the Korean War ended with the Korean people's historic great victory.

Our Korean people and their armed forces—the Korean People's Army—closely coordinated with the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers in more than three years of righteous struggle, causing the enemy to suffer tremendous failures not only militarily and politically, but also morally. The Korean War nakedly exposed the true face of the most barbaric modern imperialism—American imperialism—to the world. They wantonly trampled on international law and unscrupulously and cruelly slaughtered peaceful residents, thereby arousing extreme indignation among the Korean people who fought for justice and all honest people in the world.

The American imperialists attempted to conquer the Korean people and save their military defeat with such atrocities.

From the beginning of the war, the American aggressors mobilized aircraft and warships to destroy and burn down our country's peaceful cities, villages, and mountains, fields and gardens. They carried out massacres, torture, and other atrocities against peaceful residents, and even used gas bombs and bacteriological weapons.

However, no atrocities committed by the doomed imperialists could subdue the Korean people, who were fighting heroically for the freedom and independence of their motherland and for lasting world peace. On the contrary, the more frantic the aggressors' beastly atrocities, the more they strengthened the Korean people's fiery hatred of the enemy and their determination for revenge a thousandfold.

The Korean people will never forget the heinous enemy—the various unforgivable atrocities committed by the American imperialists against the Korean people.

As soon as the Korean War began, the American aggressors mobilized their air force and barbarously bombed many Korean cities with no military targets, destroying homes, leaving residents homeless and wandering the streets. They also destroyed cultural facilities such as schools, hospitals, and newspapers, and brutally murdered peaceful residents.

After more than three years of the Korean War, it was impossible to find a city or even a village in the northern half of our republic that had escaped bombing. This shows that the American aggressors' bombing of residents in peaceful areas was planned and extremely vicious.

American air pirates even strafed children bathing in rivers, women washing clothes on the banks, and farmers working in the fields with machine guns. They also bombed hospitals with clear Red Cross markings, killing hospitalized patients. This is simply the beastly act of inhumanity. There are countless examples of this kind of atrocity.

The beastly atrocities committed by the American aggressors in various parts of South Korea that had once been liberated by the People's Army, and in various parts of the northern half of the Republic that they and the traitorous Syngman Rhee gang once occupied, were unprecedented in the history of warfare. Their cruelty far exceeded human imagination. The American imperialists imprisoned, tortured, or massacred all members and members of democratic parties and people's organizations, as well as personnel who had participated in the democratic reform to establish people's power and the vast majority of civilians. The most heinous enemies of mankind—the American imperialists—even brutally murdered old people and innocent children, as well as women holding babies. The methods of massacre included: beating to death with clubs, dismembering alive, disemboweling, burning to death, suffocating to death, stabbing to death with bayonets, starving to death, shooting, and even burying alive and other inhuman and brutal means. Before killing people in such heinous ways, the American executioners also subjected the victims to appalling tortures such as electric shocks, waterboarding, clubbing, and cutting flesh.

Wherever the claws of the American aggressors reached, the blood of innocent people flowed into rivers. Just a few examples here are enough to fully demonstrate how heinous the American executioners were.

When the American bandits occupied Samgae-ri, Gacheon-myeon, Byeokseong-gun, Hwanghae Province, they massacred 59 Labor Party members and many people. In Iryeo, Samgae-ri, a 54-year-old man was stripped naked, tied upside down behind a car, dragged back and forth through a thorny forest, and finally sawed off his neck to kill him. Farmer Go Myeong-ok was accused by American executioners of preserving the national flag of the Republic, was beaten with firewood and then smashed his head with stones. In Samgae-ri, American bandits locked seventeen innocent children under the age of fourteen in a warehouse, deprived them of food and starved them to death. Finally, they poured gasoline on them and burned them to death. Some children broke through the flames and struggled to escape when they were being burned, but the enemy chopped off their necks or smashed their skulls with shovels.

On March 12, 1952, the bodies of more than 50 people murdered by American executioners were found in an earthen pit in Yeonkaegok, Husan, Junghwa-ri, Hamju-gun. Some of the people had head injuries from being beaten with clubs or axes, and there were also several gunshot wounds. There were also some naked female corpses with their hands tied with iron wire, their breasts cut off, knives inserted in their necks, and buried upside down. The corpse of a woman named Hong Jeong-pyo also had her two-year-old child on her back, her breasts were cut off, her limbs were torn apart, and there were also marks of being stabbed with sharp knives. The corpse of a man named Ju Seong-hwa had his head smashed, his nose cut off, a sharp knife inserted in his neck, and his skin was burnt.

The American bandits even set up a killing field in Tanghwa-dong, Haeseong-myeon, Namyeonbaek-gun, and caught innocent Korean youths, hung them upside down from the beams, and beat them with multi-stranded iron wire clubs. The executioners cut open the chests of the youths who had suffered extreme torture and fainted and gouged out their hearts and livers. When the whole village protested, the American executioners strafed them with machine guns. In this village of only about 150 households, more than 600 people were massacred by American executioners in this one incident alone.

In Pyongyang, American executioners captured the families of more than 1,000 Korean Labor Party members and People's Committee staff members, brutally tortured and raped them, and then killed them all. In Sunchon, American troops and the Syngman Rhee gang brutally cut off the nose and breasts of an 18-year-old girl named Kang and killed her. In a place 20 kilometers away from Sunchon, American beast soldiers raped a woman who had given birth less than a week ago. During the few days of occupying Chusan, American executioners massacred more than 900 peaceful residents. A housewife named Kim was gang-raped by six American beast soldiers and then brutally murdered.

From September 30, 1950, to January 4, 1951, during the period when the US-Rhee forces reoccupied Seoul and retreated again, the US-Rhee gang arrested and imprisoned more than 75,000 people in Seoul. When the People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers were about to liberate Seoul, American executioners arrested and massacred 72,390 Korean patriots. When the American invading army retreated from Seoul, they forcibly took away more than 12,000 people from Seodaemun Prison, more than 1,000 people from the military special prison, and more than 17,000 people from other prisons. More than 10,000 of these people who were taken away were shot and killed while being forced to march south.

When the American invading army retreated south, they also kidnapped a large number of residents. In Seoul alone, hundreds of thousands of citizens were forcibly taken away. Many of these peaceful residents were strafed to death by the American air force. More than 25,380 people were forcibly taken away from Yangyang-gun, Gangwon-do, most of whom were massacred by enemy air force machine gun fire or bombing.

The US military also used similar brutal methods to massacre peaceful residents in other areas outside Seoul, and the number is simply impossible to count.

The largest of these was the massacre in Sincheon-gun, Hwanghae Province. In this county alone, they massacred more than 35,000 people. This great tragedy was caused under the direct command of Haidison, the American military commander stationed in Sincheon-gun, Hwanghae Province.

Every area that had been temporarily occupied by the American invading army left behind countless bloody atrocities.

The barbaric atrocities of the American invaders cannot conquer the heroic Korean people who love peace and freedom. The US government even fantasized about using bacteriological warfare to massacre more peaceful residents. This atrocity by the American aggressors is the most serious atrocity against humanity and a further blatant trampling on international law and humanitarian principles. As early as 1925, countries around the world signed the Geneva Protocol on the prohibition of the use of asphyxiating gases or other similar weapons and bacteriological weapons in war. However, the American aggressors inhumanely used bacteriological weapons in Korea. What a heinous atrocity this is!

The bacteriological warfare atrocities carried out by the United States to massacre the Korean people on a large scale began in 1950 when the US military retreated from the northern part of the Republic, when they spread smallpox viruses in the areas they occupied. At that time, it was only because the government and people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea discovered the enemy's vicious plot in time and took effective measures that smallpox was prevented from spreading.

However, from the winter of 1951, the American aggressors used bacteriological weapons on a larger scale in a more vicious manner, dropping large quantities of various poisonous insects and specially-made bacteriological bombs or containers containing bacteria and other things carrying plague, cholera, and other infectious diseases on the positions of our Korean and Chinese troops and in the northern half of the area.

While using bacteriological weapons on a large scale, the American imperialists systematically fired or dropped gas bombs on our army's positions with artillery and aircraft. For example, on August 1, 1951, the US Air Force dropped two 30-kilogram gas bombs containing poison gas on Yan'an City, poisoning three soldiers and more than 40 residents. On August 7 of the same year, US military aircraft dropped gas bombs containing poison gas, weighing approximately 50 kilograms, on the position of the Dounanshan highland occupied by our army. During the period from February 27 to April 9, 1952 alone, the American invading army used gas bombs 36 times, and the area covered by the gas bombs they used included the vast area of the entire front line.

It should also be pointed out that the atrocities committed by the American invading army against our captured personnel were brutal.

The atrocities committed by the American aggressors against our captured personnel in violation of international law were carried out in order to realize their conspiracy to forcibly detain our captured personnel. The American imperialists insisted on the absurd "principle of voluntary repatriation" to deliberately delay the armistice negotiations and repeatedly and unreasonably unilaterally sabotaged the armistice negotiations.

As is well known, Geoje Island has been called "Death Island." Not only on Geoje Island, but also in prisoner-of-war camps in Masan, Gwangju, Busan, and other places, our captured personnel were constantly subjected to torture and massacres. The enemy's prisoner-of-war camps in various places were surrounded by iron wire, gallows, steam rooms, and other barriers.

American executioners killed countless of our captured personnel who refused the US forced "screening." These prisoner-of-war camps were truly living hells. When prisoners of war talked to each other in groups of two or three, they were suspected of "resistance" and were beaten or killed. Prisoners of war were also massacred for singing "The World Democratic Youth March" or "General Kim Il-sung's Song." On August 15, 1951, the day of Korea's liberation from the shackles of Japanese imperialism, more than a dozen of our captured personnel in the Busan female prisoner-of-war camp were killed by the US military and the Rhee Syngman army for singing "General Kim Il-sung's Song."

Moreover, according to a report in the Cairo-based "Kumeir Misri" weekly on September 24, 1951, the American aggressors transported more than 500 of our captured personnel from prisoner-of-war camps as subjects for atomic experiments in order to test the effectiveness of the atomic bomb. It is still unknown where these prisoners of war were taken. Many other materials have confirmed that the American aggressors used our captured personnel as experimental subjects for bacteriological weapons. The American aggressors used these most barbaric and inhuman methods to kill our captured personnel.

The blind bombing of peaceful residential areas by the American aggressors, the mass slaughter of peaceful residents in temporarily occupied areas, the use of bacteriological weapons and poison gas on the front lines and in the rear, and the atrocities of massacring prisoners of war on Geoje Island or other prisoner-of-war camps, were far more barbaric and cruel than the atrocities committed by the Hitler bandits in concentration camps such as Medanek and Auschwitz during World War II.

The American aggressors attempted to conquer the Korean people, weaken the Korean people's will to resist, and thwart their desire for the autonomy and independence of their motherland with these heinous crimes. However, the American aggressors' crazy attempt suffered a shameful defeat. These atrocities by the American aggressors have further aroused the resistance and hatred of our Korean people towards them and aroused the indignation of peace-loving people all over the world.

Our Korean people overcame all difficulties and obstacles on the front lines and in the rear in the righteous Fatherland Liberation War against the aggressors and waged a heroic struggle, finally achieving victory.

The heroic soldiers of the People's Army, closely coordinating with the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers, displayed unparalleled heroism, annihilated and defeated the American invading army, which boasted of "technical superiority," everywhere, gloriously defended the flag of the Republic, and ensured the victory of the war.

The working people in the rear nervously produced in underground factories to support the front lines, ensuring the supply of military materials. The heroes on the transportation lines, braving constant bombing by enemy aircraft, drove trains and cars at night, rushing to the front lines, and ensuring the timely transportation of military supplies. Even under the conditions of frenzied bombing by enemy aircraft, Korean farmers carried out spring plowing and sowing on time, ensuring the grain needed for the front and rear. The Korean people waged a heroic struggle in all aspects.

Our Korean people, during the period of temporary occupation by the enemy, always held high the flag of the Republic, launched guerrilla warfare, and defeated the enemy. Even in the enemy's prisoner-of-war camps, regardless of the enemy's persecution and beastly massacres, they defended the glorious flag of the Republic with heroic struggles that had never been seen or heard of in history.

The Korean people, through their heroic resistance, forced the American armed aggressors to sign the armistice agreement. In this way, the more than three years of bloody Korean War ended with the glorious victory of our Korean people.

In this way, the Korean people, under the correct leadership of their beloved leader Marshal Kim Il-sung and the Korean Workers' Party, and with the support and solidarity of the people of the great Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries, as well as peace-loving people all over the world, gave a heavy blow to the enemy of peace—American imperialism—and crushed their aggressive plans in Korea. This made a great contribution to the great cause of defending world peace, especially in defending Asian peace.

    美军在朝鲜屠杀和平居民的暴行
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”社编辑局长  黄珪进
    美帝国主义者企图变我们祖国为它的殖民地，奴役我国人民，并想以我国为跳板，进而侵略中国和苏联，因此它发动了侵略朝鲜的战争。三年多以来，朝鲜人民在以苏联为首的社会主义和人民民主主义国家人民和全世界爱好自由和平人民的支持和声援下，克服了一切艰难困苦，发挥了空前的英雄主义、自我牺牲精神和顽强的坚韧性，进行了不屈不挠的艰苦斗争，终于使朝鲜战争以朝鲜人民的历史性伟大胜利而告结束了。
    我们朝鲜人民及其武装力量——朝鲜人民军，与兄弟般的中国人民志愿军紧密地协同作战，在三年多的正义斗争中，使敌人不仅在军事和政治上，而且在道义上遭到了巨大的失败。朝鲜战争向全世界赤裸裸地暴露了最野蛮的现代帝国主义的魁首——美帝国主义的真面目。它们横暴地蹂躏了国际公法，肆无忌惮地极其残忍地屠杀了和平居民，从而激起了为正义而战的朝鲜人民以及世界上一切正直人民的极度愤慨。
    美帝国主义者曾企图以这样的暴行来征服朝鲜人民，并挽救它们在军事上的惨败。
    美国侵略者从战争的初期开始，就动员了飞机和军舰，破坏和烧毁我们祖国的和平城市、乡村以及山野和田园；对于和平居民则施行大量屠杀、拷打和其他的暴行，甚至使用了毒气弹及细菌武器。
    但是，面临灭亡的帝国主义者的任何暴行，都没能使为自己祖国的自由、独立和为全世界的持久和平而英勇斗争的朝鲜人民屈服。相反地，侵略者的野兽般的暴行愈疯狂，就愈千百倍地加强了朝鲜人民反对敌人的火焰般的憎恨和复仇的决心。
    朝鲜人民将永远不会忘记万恶的仇敌——美帝国主义者对朝鲜人民所进行的不可饶恕的各种暴行。
    朝鲜战争一开始，美国侵略者就动员航空部队，野蛮地轰炸了毫无军事目标的许多朝鲜城市；炸毁住宅，使居民无家可归，徬徨于街头；又破坏学校、医院、报馆等文化设施，极其残忍地杀害和平居民。
    经过三年多的朝鲜战争，在我们共和国的北半部，竟不可能找到一座幸免被炸的城市甚至于一个乡村。由此可见，美国侵略者对于和平区居民的轰炸是有计划的，极其毒辣的。
    美国空中强盗竟对在河里洗澡的儿童，在江边洗衣的妇女，在田园里劳动的农民以机枪扫射。它们对于有鲜明红十字标志的病院也恣行轰炸，杀害住院的病人。这简直是毫无人性的野兽的暴行。这一类的暴行是不胜枚举的。
    美国侵略者在曾一度被人民军解放的南朝鲜各地，和以后它与李承晚卖国匪帮一度侵占的共和国北半部各地所进行的野兽般的暴行，在战争历史上是没有前例的。它们的残忍性远远超过了人类的想像。美帝国主义者把所有民主政党及人民团体的党员和会员，以及参加过民主改革建立人民政权工作的人员和广大平民都加以监禁、拷打或屠杀。人类的穷凶恶极的敌人——美帝国主义者，甚至对老人和天真的孩子们以及怀抱着婴儿的妇女，都野蛮地加以杀害。屠杀的办法包括：用棍棒打死、活活地拆肢、剖腹、用火烧死、窒息致死、刺刀刺死、饿死、枪杀，甚至活埋等灭绝人性的残暴手段。美国刽子手们在以这种种令人发指的方法把人杀害以前，还对被杀者施以电刑、灌水、棍打、割肉等的目不忍睹的酷刑。
    美国侵略者的魔爪所及，无辜人民的鲜血流成了江河。这里只举出其中的几个例子，就可以充分地看出美国刽子手们是何等穷凶极恶。
    美国强盗在侵占黄海道碧城郡嘉川面三瑰里时，屠杀了五十九名劳动党员和许多人民。在三瑰里二闾，把一名五十四岁的老人，剥光了衣服倒绑在汽车后面，拉到长满荆棘的树林子里来回拖拉，最后才锯掉他的脖子弄死了他。农民高明玉被美国刽子手以保存共和国的国旗为罪名，用劈柴乱打后，用石头砸碎了他的头颅。在三瑰里，美国强盗把十七名十四岁以下的天真的儿童关在仓库里，不给食物，使他们活活地饿着，最后，又浇上汽油，烧死了他们。有的小孩在被烧时冲破烈火，挣扎着往外逃跑，敌人又用铁锹砍掉他们的脖子或砸碎他们的头骨。
    一九五二年三月十二日，在咸州郡中和里后山延开谷的一个土坑里，发现了被美国刽子手杀害的五十余人的尸体，其中有些人的头部有以棍棒或斧子砍打的伤痕，还有数处枪杀的痕迹。还有一些裸体的女尸，是用铁丝绑着两只手，挖掉了乳房，脖子上还插着刀，倒埋着的。一位名叫洪正杓的妇女的尸体身上，还背着两周岁的孩子，乳房被挖掉，四肢被拆裂开，还有用利刀乱刺的痕迹。名叫朱盛华的尸体，被砸碎了头部，被割掉了鼻子，一把利刀还插在脖子上，皮肤全被烧焦了。
      美国强盗在南延白郡海城面唐华洞，竟设了杀人场，把无辜的朝鲜青年抓去，倒吊在梁上，用多股的铁丝棍乱打他们。刽子手们把受尽苦刑而昏过去的青年，剖胸挖出心肝。全体村民起来抗议，美国刽子手们就用机枪扫射。这个仅有一百五十户左右的村庄，仅在这一次就被美国刽子手屠杀了六百多人。
    在平壤，美国刽子手们抓去了一千多个朝鲜劳动党员和人民委员会工作人员的家眷，横加以残暴的拷打和强奸后，全部予以杀害。在顺川，美国军队和李承晚匪帮，把一位姓姜的十八岁的姑娘，残暴地割掉鼻子和乳房杀死。在离顺川二十公里的地方，美军兽兵强奸了产后不到一星期的产妇。在强占楚山的不几天的期间，美国刽子手们就屠杀了九百余名和平居民，家庭妇女金氏被六个美国兽兵轮奸后惨遭杀害。
    从一九五○年九月三十日到一九五一年一月四日，即美李匪军再度侵占汉城和再度败退的中间一段时期，美李匪帮又在汉城逮捕并监禁了七万五千余人。当人民军和中国人民志愿军将解放汉城时，美国刽子手们逮捕并屠杀了七万二千三百九十名朝鲜爱国者。美国侵略军由汉城溃退的时候，又把西大门监狱里的一万二千余人和军队特别监狱里的一千余人及其他监狱里的一万七千余人强迫拉走。这些被拉走的人，在被迫向南走的途中，被枪杀了一万人以上。
    美国侵略军向南溃退时，还掳走了大批居民，只在汉城一地就强迫拉走了数十万市民。这些和平居民被美国空军扫射而死者甚多。江原道襄阳郡被强迫拉走了二万五千三百八十余人，其中的大部分都被敌人航空部队的机枪扫射或轰炸而被屠杀。
    美军在汉城外的其他地区，也用类似的残暴方法屠杀和平居民，其数量之多，简直是无法统计。
    其中最大的算是黄海道信川郡的大屠杀案。只在这个郡里，它们就屠杀了三万五千余人。这一大惨案是在驻黄海道信川郡的美军司令官海迪逊的直接指挥下所造成的。
    一切被美国侵略军暂时侵占过的地区，都留下了无数的血腥暴行。
    美国侵略者的野蛮暴行，是不可能征服爱好和平与自由的英勇的朝鲜人民的。美国政府就幻想用细菌战来屠杀更多的和平居民。美国侵略者的这种暴行，是反对人类的最严重的暴行，也是进一步横暴蹂躏国际法和人道主义原则的暴行。世界各国早在一九二五年就签订了关于在战争中禁用窒息性毒气或与此类似的其他武器和细菌武器的日内瓦议定书。然而，美国侵略者竟在朝鲜毫无人性地使用了细菌武器，这是多么穷凶极恶的暴行！
    美国为大量屠杀朝鲜人民而施行的细菌战暴行，早在一九五○年美军由共和国北部溃退的时候，就在它侵占的地区撒布了天花病毒。当时只是由于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和人民及时地发现了敌人的这种恶毒计谋，采取了有效措施，才使天花没有能够蔓延。
    可是，美国侵略者从一九五一年冬天起，更以毒辣的方法，大规模地使用了细菌武器，向我们朝中部队的阵地和北半部地区，大量地投下了带有鼠疫、霍乱和其他传染病菌的各种毒虫和特制的细菌炸弹或装有细菌的容器及其他的东西。
    美帝国主义者与大规模地使用细菌武器同时，以大炮和飞机，有计划地向我军阵地发射或投下了毒气弹。例如，一九五一年八月一日，美国空军向延安市投下了两个装有毒气的三十公斤的毒气弹，致使三名军人和四十余名居民中了毒。同年八月七日，美军飞机向我军所占领的斗南山高地的阵地，投下了装有毒气的约重五十公斤的毒气弹。仅在一九五二年二月二十七日至四月九日的这一期间，美国侵略军就使用了三十六次毒气弹，它们所使用毒气弹的范围，包括全部前线的广大地区。
    还应指出的是美国侵略军虐杀我方被俘人员的暴行。
    美国侵略者违犯国际公法对我方被俘人员所施行的暴行，是企图为了实现他们强迫扣留我方被俘人员的阴谋而进行的。美帝国主义者曾坚持荒谬的
  “自愿遣返原则”来故意拖延了停战谈判，并且蛮横无理地片面地屡次破坏停战谈判。
    如所周知，巨济岛已被称为“死亡之岛”。不仅在巨济岛，在马山、光州、釜山等地战俘营里的我方被俘人员，也不断遭到了拷打和虐杀。敌人的各地战俘营，都是以铁丝网、绞架、蒸气室等重重包围起来的。
    美国刽子手们杀害了无数拒绝美方的强迫“甄别”的我方被俘人员。这些战俘营，真正地都成了活地狱。战俘们两三个人在一起谈话，就被加上“反抗”的嫌疑，被打或被杀。战俘们唱了“世界民主青年进行曲”或“金日成将军之歌”，也惨遭屠杀。一九五一年八月十五日，是朝鲜由日本帝国主义的羁绊下获得解放的节日，这一天，在釜山女战俘营的我方被俘人员，因高唱了“金日成将军之歌”，就有十余名被美军和李承晚军队杀害。
    不仅如此，根据在开罗出版的“久米尔·米斯里”周刊在一九五一年九月二十四日报道：美国侵略者为试验原子弹的效力，从战俘营里运走了五百余名我方被俘人员，做为原子试验的对象。这些战俘直到如今还不知究竟被拉到什么地方去了。还有其他的许多资料都证实美国侵略者拿我方被俘人员做为细菌武器的试验对象。美国侵略者就以这种最野蛮最惨无人道的方法，杀害了我方的被俘人员。
    美国侵略者对于和平居民地区的盲目轰炸，在暂时强占地区的大量屠杀和平居民，在前线和后方使用细菌武器和毒气，在巨济岛或其他战俘营里屠杀战俘的暴行，其野蛮残忍，都远过于在第二次世界大战时期希特勒匪徒在麦丹尼克、奥斯威辛等地的集中营中所犯下的暴行。
    美国侵略者企图以这种令人发指的罪行，来征服朝鲜人民，削弱朝鲜人民的反抗意志，并挫败他们对自己祖国的自主独立的愿望。可是，美国侵略者的疯狂企图，遭到了可耻的失败。美国侵略者的这些暴行，更加激起了我们朝鲜人民对它的反抗和憎恨，激起了全世界爱好和平人民对它的激愤。
    我们朝鲜人民在反对侵略者的正义的祖国解放战争中，在前线和后方克服所有的困难和障碍，进行英勇的斗争，终于获得了胜利。
      英雄的人民军将士们，与兄弟般的中国人民志愿军紧紧地协同作战，发挥了无比的英勇精神，到处歼灭和打败了自夸为“技术上优势”的美国侵略军，光荣地捍卫了共和国的旗帜，保证了战争的胜利。
    后方的劳动人民，为了支援前线，在地下工厂紧张地生产，保证了军需物资的供应。在交通线上的英雄们，冒着敌机的不断轰炸，夜间驾驶着火车和汽车，奔向前线，及时地保证了军需物资的运输。虽在敌机疯狂轰炸的条件下，朝鲜农民按时进行春耕和播种，保证了前后方所需的粮食。朝鲜人民在各方面都进行了英勇的斗争。
    我们朝鲜人民，在敌人暂时强占的时期，始终高举着共和国的旗帜，展开游击战争，战胜了敌人；甚至在敌人的战俘营里，不顾敌人的一切迫害和兽性的屠杀，以历史上未曾有过也未曾听见过的英勇斗争，保卫了共和国的光荣旗帜。
    朝鲜人民以自己的英勇抗争，迫使美国武装侵略者在停战协定上签了字。这样，三年多的流血的朝鲜战争，以我们朝鲜人民的光荣胜利而告结束了。
    这样，朝鲜人民在自己的敬爱的领袖金日成元帅和朝鲜劳动党的正确领导下，在伟大的苏联、中国和各人民民主国家人民以及全世界爱好和平人民的支持和声援下，给和平的敌人——美帝国主义以沉重的打击，粉碎了它们在朝鲜的侵略计划，这对于保卫世界和平、尤其是在保卫亚洲和平的伟大事业上，做了巨大的贡献。
