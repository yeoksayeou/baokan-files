Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 23rd: The Korean-Chinese side presented the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission with the explanation work plan for the 24th this morning, requesting explanations for the remaining 250 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who have not received explanations at Camp No. 4.

The explanation period stipulated in the "Terms of Reference" is ninety days. Because the American side obstructed the passage of the "Detailed Rules of Procedure," the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission decided on September 24th to postpone and extend the explanation period. Subsequently, due to the American side's delay in the construction of explanation facilities, and the Li and Chiang Kai-shek secret agents in the POW camps directing and sabotaging the explanation work, the Korean-Chinese side's explanation work was delayed until October 15th to begin, and was continuously forced to interrupt five times. Therefore, from October 15th to December 23rd, in the seventy days, the Korean-Chinese side only conducted explanations for ten days under the constant disturbance of American secret agents and so-called "representatives," and the explanation time each day was less than eight hours.

The Korean-Chinese side has long pointed out that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission should earnestly implement the provisions of the "Terms of Reference" and the "Detailed Rules of Procedure," take resolute measures to thoroughly eliminate all secret agents in the POW camps, break up the secret agents' terrorist organizations, and, in accordance with the provisions of the "Terms of Reference," make up for the ninety days of explanation to change the current serious situation surrounding the POW repatriation issue. The American side's groundless opposition to extending the explanation period can only prove its deliberate intention to prevent the POWs from exercising their right to be repatriated, in order to forcibly detain more than 20,000 of our captured personnel.

    朝中方面提出二十四日的解释工作计划
    中立国遣返委员会应按照“职权范围”规定顺延解释期限
    【新华社开城二十三日电】朝中方面今天上午向中立国遣返委员会提出二十四日的解释工作计划，要求对第四号营场剩下的未听解释的二百五十名中国人民志愿军被俘人员进行解释。
    “职权范围”规定的解释期限为九十天。中立国遣返委员会因为美方阻挠“工作细则”的通过，在九月二十四日决定将解释期限予以推迟和顺延。随后，由于美方拖延解释设备的修建，以及指挥战俘营中的李、蒋特务阻挠和破坏解释工作，使朝中方面的解释工作拖延到十月十五日才开始，并且连续被迫中断五次。因此，从十月十五日到十二月二十三日的七十天中，朝中方面在美方特务及所谓“代表”的不断扰乱下，仅仅进行了十天的解释，每天的解释时间都不够八小时。
    朝中方面早已指出：中立国遣返委员会应该切实执行“职权范围”和“工作细则”的规定，采取坚决措施，彻底清除战俘营中的一切特务，打散特务的恐怖组织，并按照“职权范围”的规定，补足九十天的解释日期，以改变当前笼罩着战俘遣返问题的严重局势。美方毫无理由地反对顺延解释期限，只能证明其蓄意阻止战俘行使被遣返的权利，以强迫扣留二万多名我方被俘人员。
