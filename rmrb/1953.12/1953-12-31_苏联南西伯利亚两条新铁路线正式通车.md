Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 30th: Two new railway lines in the Soviet Union have recently been officially opened to traffic. One runs from Akmolinsk to Pavlodar; the other from Kulunda to Barnaul. These two railway lines are important parts of the section from Abakan to Akmolinsk of the South Siberian Railway main line, which is stipulated in the Fifth Five-Year Plan. The section of the railway line from Kulunda to Barnaul was completed as early as May, and the first train left Barnaul for Kulunda on May 25. The completion and opening of the above two railway lines will enable the two major economic regions of the Soviet Union—the Southern Urals and the Kuznetsk coal region—to be connected by the shortest route.

	The railway line from Akmolinsk to Pavlodar was opened to traffic on December 20. The entire section is 438 kilometers long and is the middle section of the South Siberian Railway main line. This new railway line is of great significance to the economic and cultural development of central Kazakhstan, and it will promote the further development of the mining industry and agriculture in the surrounding areas. The opening of this new railway line is a happy event for the people of Kazakhstan. It is a proof of the care of the Soviet Communist Party and the government for the economic and cultural development of Kazakhstan, and it is also a symbol of the friendship of all nationalities in the Soviet Union. Along the railway, many workers' residential areas that could not be found on the ground have been built. In these residential areas, power plants, radio broadcasting stations, clubs, shops, schools, kindergartens and hospitals have appeared. After the opening of the new railway line, trains full of Siberian timber and coal from Pavlodar and trains full of building materials, agricultural machinery and daily necessities from Akmolinsk run back and forth continuously.

	The railway line from Kulunda to Barnaul was opened to traffic on December 26. This railway line is in the Altai Krai and is 343 kilometers long. The railway workers completed this railway in a very short period of time. The stations along the line are fully equipped. Workers' villages, clubs, libraries, shops, canteens, etc. have been established.

    苏联南西伯利亚两条新铁路线正式通车
    【新华社莫斯科三十日电】苏联最近有两条新铁路线正式通车。一条是从阿克摩林斯克到巴夫洛达；一条从库仑达到巴尔瑙尔。这两条铁路线是第五个五年计划中规定要修筑的南西伯利亚铁路干线从阿巴根到阿克摩林斯克段的重要部分。从库仑达到巴尔瑙尔一段铁路线，早在五月间就已完成铺轨工作，第一列火车就在五月二十五日从巴尔瑙尔开往库仑达。上述两条铁路线的建成和通车，使苏联两大重要经济区域——南乌拉尔和库兹涅茨克煤区可以靠最短的旅程连接起来。
    从阿克摩林斯克到巴夫洛达这一段铁路线是在十二月二十日通车的。全段共长四百三十八公里，是南西伯利亚铁路干线的中段。这段新铁路线对哈萨克共和国中部的经济和文化发展有极重大的意义，它将促进这个地区采矿工业及附近地区的农业进一步发展。这条新铁路线的通车是哈萨克人民的喜事。它是苏联共产党和政府关怀哈萨克经济和文化发展的证明，也是苏联各民族友谊的一个标志。沿着铁路，许多在地面上找不到的工人住宅区都建筑起来了。在这些住宅区内，电力厂、无线电广播站、俱乐部、商店、学校、托儿所和医院都出现了。新铁路线通车后，从巴夫洛达满载着西伯利亚木材和煤的列车，由阿克摩林斯克满载着建筑材料、农业机器和日用品的列车，源源不断地对开着。
    从库仑达到巴尔瑙尔的一段铁路线，在十二月二十六日通车。这段铁路线在阿尔泰边疆区内，全长三百四十三公里。铁路工人们在很短的时间内就完成了这条铁路。沿线的车站都设备齐全。工人村、俱乐部、图书馆、商店、食堂等都建立起来了。
