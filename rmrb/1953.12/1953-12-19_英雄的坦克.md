Editor's note: The first Congress of Heroes and Model Representatives of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Armored Forces was recently held in Beijing. Thirty-five heroes and model representatives of the Volunteer Army Armored Forces were also invited to attend the congress. Among the Volunteer Army representatives were the famous "No. 215" special-class hero vehicle commander and first-class hero Yang Aru. After the "No. 215" tank entered Korea to fight, it cooperated with infantry in eight battles, destroying five enemy heavy tanks and damaging one. The following news report describes the heroic deeds of the "No. 215" tank in a battle during our army's summer offensive this year.

This was on the eve of the Korean armistice.

On the evening of July 6th, the "No. 215" tank of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army received an urgent combat mission and sped towards the front line in the heavy rain. The heavy rain had damaged the roads and washed away the road-supporting timber. Before the tank could enter the position, it was stuck in the mud and could not move. At this time, our infantry had already captured North Stone Hyun Hill, but was threatened by the artillery fire of three heavy tanks on the enemy's 346.6 Hill in front. In the pitch-black night and torrential rain, it was impossible to find timber to place under the wheels, and the tank could not be rescued for the time being. The other two tanks that were originally scheduled to be put into battle could not provide reinforcement due to the poor road conditions.

What to do? After analyzing the entire battle situation, the command issued an order: "The 'No. 215' tank must display the tenacious fighting style of the tank unit, fire on the spot, and destroy the three enemy tanks on the 346.6 Hill within five minutes to ensure the safety of the defending troops on North Stone Hyun Hill!" It was difficult to carry out combat missions while the vehicle was stuck, but the tank crew did not show any fear in the face of difficulties, but bravely accepted the order. Driver Chen Wenkui, who participated in the battle while sick, said: "The more arduous the task, the more glorious we are. The time has come for the Party to test us!" So all the combatants of the tank immediately checked their weapons, prepared ammunition, and waited for orders to fire. Gunner Xu Zhiqiang painstakingly marked the position of the enemy tanks on the sight and fired four shots in succession. Immediately, one enemy tank caught fire. The other two tanks hurriedly returned fire, firing a volley of shells. Gas poured into the turret from the barrel, choking Xu Zhiqiang and causing him to shed tears, but he tried his best to keep his eyes wide open, staring at the muzzle flashes of the enemy tanks. He fired another volley of shots, and another tank was set ablaze. The fire clearly illuminated the enemy's third tank. Xu Zhiqiang was overjoyed and turned the turret to continue firing. In an instant, the enemy's third tank also became silent. At this time, less than five minutes had passed since the start of firing. Then, the enemy brought in artillery to attack our position. The "No. 215" tank continued to "fire on the spot," cooperating with the infantry to repel the enemy's counterattacks again and again.

The 8th was another day of severe testing for the "No. 215" tank. The enemy had tightened their blockade of the swampy area caused by the heavy rain. More than 5,000 shells fell within 1,000 meters of the tank in a single day. The camouflaged "No. 215" tank had its windows and doors tightly closed. Inside the tank, it was extremely hot. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, the tank crew was exhausted. Driver Chen Wenkui, gunner Xu Zhiqiang, and radio operator Xu Shide had all fainted in the tank. At this time, the command fully understood the difficult situation of the "No. 215" tank and ordered them: if possible, leave two people to continue fighting, and the others should retreat first. After commander Yang Aru announced this order to everyone, he said: "Comrades, go down! The gunner and I will stay here and continue fighting. You trust me, I am a Communist Party member, I guarantee the tank is here and I am here." Chen Wenkui jumped up and said: "I shouldn't go down, I am also a Communist Party member." He also said to the commander: "You are the commander, you need to command the entire platoon, you should go down!" Gunner Xu Zhiqiang quickly added: "I am a member of the Communist Youth League, the time has come to test me, I will persevere until the final victory." None of the tank crew members were willing to leave the tank at this critical and difficult moment. At this time, radio operator Xu Shide fainted again. The command ordered him to be rescued. When he woke up and found himself not in the tank, he immediately crawled back to the tank through the artillery fire to continue performing his duties.

They finally persevered until July 9th. The sky cleared, and the enemy seemed to have discovered something, and the artillery fire became even tighter. The command came with an order: "The tank must be rescued before 9:00 p.m. tonight, and two other enemy tanks must be destroyed at 9:30 p.m. to cooperate with the counterattack troops and ensure the safety of the defending troops on North Stone Hyun Hill." The tank crew members, who had persisted in fighting for two days and three nights without rest, immediately generated new strength upon hearing the order. While continuing to fight, they rescued the tank. To rescue the tank, they needed to find timber, so they divided their manpower and worked with the engineers to climb the mountain. In order to conceal themselves, they had to tie grass around their bodies and crawl up the mountain. When descending the mountain, they tied the timber to their waists, and people crawled down, and the timber rolled down with them. Sometimes, the heavy timber pressed down on them, dragging them down. Branches and thorns tore their clothes and pricked their bodies. In this way, for an entire day, they finally collected more than seventy pieces of timber and rescued the tank at 8:30 p.m. and drove it to the firing position. This time, the reserve gunner Shi Hongshan fired. Chen Wenkui organized the shells, Xu Shide passed the shells, and Yang Aru directed the firing. From 9:30 p.m., the "No. 215" tank began to fire continuously. Within eleven minutes, it fired forty-four shells, destroying two more enemy tanks and destroying twenty bunkers. In total, in this single-tank combat operation, the "No. 215" tank destroyed four enemy heavy tanks, damaged one, destroyed twenty enemy bunkers, seven 50-caliber machine gun nests, and seven small-caliber guns. It excellently cooperated with the infantry to complete the task of eliminating the enemy. (Attached photo)

    英雄的坦克

    编者按：中国人民解放军装甲兵首届功臣模范代表大会最近在北京召开。三十五位志愿军装甲兵功臣模范也应邀参加了大会。志愿军代表中有著名的“二一五”号特等功臣车车长、一等功臣杨阿如。“二一五”号坦克入朝作战后，曾先后配合步兵作战八次，击毁敌人重型坦克五辆，击伤一辆。下面这篇通讯就是写“二一五”号坦克在今年我军夏季攻势的一次战斗中的英勇事迹的。
    这是在朝鲜停战前夕。
    七月六日晚上，志愿军某部“二一五”号坦克，接受了一项紧急战斗任务，冒着大雨向前沿急驰。大雨冲坏了道路，冲走了垫路的木头，坦克还没有开进阵地，就陷入泥泞中不能开动了。这时候，我军步兵已经攻下石岘洞北山，但却受到前面敌人三四六·六高地上三辆重型坦克炮火的威胁。当时漆黑的夜，瓢泼似的雨，不可能找到垫车的木头，坦克是一时抢救不出来的，原定投入战斗的其他两辆坦克，由于道路的情况不好，也无法增援。
    怎么办呢？指挥所在分析了整个战斗情况以后下了命令：“‘二一五’号坦克要发挥坦克部队顽强的战斗作风，就地射击，五分钟内消灭敌人三四六·六高地上的三辆坦克，保证石岘洞北山守备部队的安全！”在陷车期间又执行战斗任务，这是困难的，但是坦克手们对着困难没有表示一点畏怯，而是勇敢地接受了命令。带病参加战斗的驾驶员陈文奎说：“任务越艰巨，我们越光荣，党考验我们的时候到了！”于是坦克的全体战斗员们立即检查武器，准备弹药，待命射击。炮长徐志强吃力地在瞄准镜上标定了敌人坦克的位置，连续发出四炮，登时敌人的一辆坦克燃烧起来了，其他两辆坦克慌忙还击，打来一阵排炮，瓦斯从炮管里窜进来，呛得徐志强直淌眼泪，但他竭力睁大眼睛，死盯着敌人坦克炮口的火光，又一阵连续发射，又把一辆坦克打得满身起火，火光把敌人第三辆坦克照得清清楚楚，徐志强喜出望外地扭转炮塔继续发射，顷刻之间，敌人的第三辆坦克也变成了哑叭，这时，离开开始发射的时间还不到五分钟。接着，敌人又调来炮兵向我阵地攻击，“二一五”号坦克继续“就地射击”，配合步兵打退敌人一次又一次的反扑。
    八日，对“二一五”号坦克，是又一个严重考验的日子，敌人对这块大雨造成的沼泽地带封锁得更紧了，一天之中在坦克周围一千公尺以内就落下五千多发炮弹。伪装着的“二一五”号坦克的窗和门都紧闭起来，坦克里面，十分闷热，经过一天两夜的激烈战斗，坦克手们已疲累不堪，驾驶员陈文奎，炮长徐志强，无线电员许仕德都曾昏倒在坦克里。这时指挥所充分了解到“二一五”号坦克所处的困难情况，就命令他们：在可能的情况下，留两人坚持战斗，其他的人先撤退下来。车长杨阿如向大家宣布了这一命令之后说道：“同志们下去吧！我和炮长在这里坚持战斗，你们信任我，我是共产党员，保证人在坦克在”。陈文奎跳起来说：“我不应该下去，我也是共产党员。”他又对车长说：“你是指挥员，需要指挥全排，应该下去！”炮长徐志强连忙接着说：“我是青年团员，考验我的时刻到了，我要坚持到最后胜利。”坦克手们谁也不愿在这危急困难的时刻离开坦克。这时，无线电员许仕德又昏过去了，指挥所命令把他抢救下来，当他清醒过来发现自己不在坦克里时，立即又冒着炮火向坦克爬去，继续执行任务。
    他们终于坚持到七月九日。天放晴了，敌人仿佛发现了什么似的，炮打得更紧了。指挥所来了命令：“今天晚上九时以前要把坦克抢救出来，九时半消灭敌人另外两辆坦克，配合反击部队，保证石岘洞北山守备部队的安全。”坚持了两天三夜战斗没得休息的坦克手们，一听命令，立即产生了新的力量，一边继续战斗，一边抢救坦克。要抢救坦克，就要找木头，于是，他们就分出人力协同工兵一起上山，为了隐蔽自己，上山时要用草把身体捆起来爬上去，下山时要把木头拴在腰上，人往下爬，木头跟着往下滚，有时，沉重的木头从人身上压下来，把人拖了下去，树枝、荆棘撕破了衣服，刺坏了身体，就这样一个整天，终于收集了七十几根木头，晚上八点半钟就把坦克抢救出来了，开上了射击阵地。这次换预备炮手师鸿山射击了。于是陈文奎整理炮弹，许仕德传递炮弹，杨阿如指挥射击，从九点半起，“二一五”号坦克开始了连发，十一分钟之内，射出了四十四发炮弹，又击毁敌人坦克两辆，摧毁地堡二十个。总计在这次单车作战的战斗中，“二一五”号坦克共击毁敌人重型坦克四辆，击伤一辆，摧毁敌人地堡二十个，五○机枪巢七个和小口径炮七门。出色地配合步兵完成了消灭敌人的任务。（附图片）
