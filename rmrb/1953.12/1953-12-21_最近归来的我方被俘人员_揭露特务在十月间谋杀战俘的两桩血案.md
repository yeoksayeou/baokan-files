Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 20th: Two bloody cases of Li Seung-man's special agents murdering prisoners of war who requested repatriation, which had been concealed for nearly two months, have been revealed by Kim Yun-hee and Liu Zhen-ze, Korean People's Army prisoners of war who recently returned.

The two murders occurred in Camp No. 53 in Dongchang-ri. Kim Yun-hee and Liu Zhen-ze were originally forced to serve as "security team members" in Camp No. 53, so they were able to learn the details of the two murders.

Liu Zhen-ze said: In October, the special agents in Camp No. 53 heard that the prisoners of war in the camp were about to hear explanations, so they set up a "torture chamber" in the "security team headquarters" tent and successively imprisoned the prisoners of war who had expressed their desire to be repatriated. "Security Captain" Bai Yongdao and others beat them severely every night. At about 10:00 p.m. on October 28, Li Seung-man's special agents dragged two prisoners of war, Cui Yuan-yi and Park Dao-yuan, who had been imprisoned in the "torture chamber" for several days, out and beat them severely with wooden sticks. Kim Yun-hee, who had returned from our side, was on guard next to the barbed wire at the time and heard painful screams from the "security team headquarters" for more than an hour. After Kim Yun-hee got off duty at 12:00 p.m., he heard footsteps and the sound of the camp gate opening. It turned out that special agents were carrying the bodies of the two dead prisoners of war out of the barbed wire. The next day, the special agent murderer Bai Yongdao secretly gathered all the "security team members" and said: "These two people were beaten to death because they wanted to return to North Korea. The Indians have taken their bodies away. The prisoners of war don't know about this. You are not allowed to reveal this to anyone, or you will be treated rudely." Regarding this murder, the Indian Custodial Forces Press Office reported on October 31 that two Korean prisoners of war in Camp No. 53 had been murdered, one of whom died on October 29, and the other was seriously injured and had been sent to the hospital.

Liu Zhen-ze said: The victim of another murder was named Zhao Zai-gen. Zhao Zai-gen was imprisoned in the "torture chamber" in early October, and special agents tortured him every midnight. Cui Bing-yu, who had returned from our side, was also imprisoned in the "torture chamber" at the time and personally witnessed Zhao Zai-gen being severely beaten. Cui Bing-yu said that when Zhao Zai-gen was beaten unconscious, "Security Captain" Bai Yongdao and "Squad Leader" Yan Daxuan also said that he was pretending to be dead and kicked his stomach with leather boots. Li Wen-xie, who had returned from our side, lived in a tent only three meters away from the "torture chamber" and also heard Zhao Zai-gen's screams when he was tortured. Liu Zhen-ze, who had returned from our side, said that after Zhao Zai-gen was beaten continuously for several days, he was sent by special agents to the tent where the "elderly squad" lived. Xuan Ze-jun, who had returned from our side, was in the "elderly squad" at the time and personally saw that when Zhao Zai-gen was sent to the "elderly squad," his whole body was torn apart, he vomited blood, and he could not speak, eat, or drink water. About a week later, that is, four or five days after Cui Yuan-yi and Park Dao-yuan were killed, the special agents saw that he really couldn't live, so they deceived the Indian Custodial Forces and said that Zhao Zai-gen had been ill for several days, could not eat, and had to be sent to the hospital immediately. The Indian Custodial Forces sent an ambulance to park at the entrance of the camp, and the special agents ordered four prisoners of war from the "elderly squad" to wrap Zhao Zai-gen in a blanket, carry him into the car, and have him transported away by the Indians. All the returned personnel from our side in Camp No. 53 personally witnessed the situation of the transportation.

Four days after Zhao Zai-gen was sent to the hospital, the Indian Custodial Forces notified the special agent leader of the camp that Zhao Zai-gen died after arriving at the hospital, and said that they would investigate the deaths of Zhao Zai-gen, Cui Yuan-yi, and Park Dao-yuan, and would also have fifty prisoners of war testify. The special agent leader Bai Yongdao secretly gathered the "security team members" for a meeting and appointed fifty false witnesses. Kim Yun-hee and Liu Zhen-ze were also appointed as false witnesses. At that time, Bai Yongdao ordered the fifty false witnesses to say: "When the Indians ask questions, you must say that Zhao Zai-gen died of illness, and Cui Yuan-yi and Park Dao-yuan wanted to climb out of the barbed wire to escape and were caught up and beaten to death by 'anti-communist prisoners of war,' but they don't know who the murderer is." Bai Yongdao threatened: "Whoever tells the truth to the Indians or reveals this matter to the prisoners of war should not think about living!"

Liu Zhen-ze, who had returned from our side, said: When the Indian Custodial Forces came to investigate, they put a table outside the barbed wire and called the "witnesses" out one by one for questioning by an Indian officer who knew Japanese. The special agent Bai Yongdao automatically came out to act as a Japanese translator, and the English translator was a prisoner of war surnamed Jin appointed by Bai Yongdao. Bai Yongdao ordered the prisoner of war surnamed Jin to say: "No matter what the witness says, you are only allowed to translate according to my words." The Indian Custodial Forces investigated these two cases for a total of three days, and each "witness" was questioned twice. The fifty false witnesses followed the "testimony" that had been arranged long ago under the control of the special agents. The fifty false witnesses signed their real names on the first testimony. Later, Bai Yongdao was afraid that it would be easy to reveal the truth in the future, so he ordered them to sign false names on the second testimony. The false names signed by Kim Yun-hee and Liu Zhen-ze were "Kim Lok-hoon" and "Lee Zeng-yeol."

Kim Yun-hee said: After the investigation, the murderer Bai Yongdao gathered the fifty false witnesses again and threatened them: "This matter is over, no one is allowed to reveal the secret, otherwise he will be executed in the same way. It doesn't matter if you kill someone, there is no law here!" Therefore, these two bloodsheds have been concealed.

Kim Yun-hee said: "Now, as a real witness, I expose the crimes of Li Seung-man's special agents murdering prisoners of war to the world. The murder has been concealed for nearly two months. I ask the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian troops to reinvestigate this murder, arrest and punish the murderers, and seek justice for the victims!"

### 最近归来的我方被俘人员  揭露特务在十月间谋杀战俘的两桩血案

    最近归来的我方被俘人员
    揭露特务在十月间谋杀战俘的两桩血案
    【新华社开城二十日电】一直被隐瞒了将近两个月的两件李承晚特务谋杀要求遣返的战俘的血案，已被最近遣返归来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员金允熙和刘真泽揭露出来。
    这两件谋杀案发生在东场里第五十三号营场。金允熙和刘真泽原先在第五十三号营场里被迫充当“警备队员”，因此他们得以知道这两件谋杀案的详细经过。
    刘真泽说：十月间，第五十三号营场的特务们听说这个营场的战俘即将听取解释，就在“警备队部”的帐篷里设立了“苦刑室”，先后把曾经流露出遣返愿望的战俘囚禁在里面。“警备队长”白永道等就在每天夜里毒打他们。十月二十八日夜间大约十点钟，李承晚特务把已被囚禁在“苦刑室”内几天的两个战俘崔元一和朴道元拖出来用木棒毒打他们。我方归来人员金允熙当时正在铁丝网边上站岗，曾听到从“警备队部”里传出痛苦的喊叫声，一直喊了一个多钟头。金允熙在十二点多下岗以后，又听见脚步声和开营场门的声音。原来是特务们把两个被打死的战俘的尸体抬出铁丝网去。第二天，特务凶手白永道秘密集合全体“警备队员”说：“这两个人是因为想回北朝鲜而被打死的。印度人已把他们的尸体抬走了。战俘们都不知道这件事情。你们不准对任何人泄露这件事情，否则就对你们不客气。”对这一谋杀案，印度看管部队新闻处在十月三十一日曾报道说，第五十三号营场有两个朝鲜战俘遭到谋害，其中一人已于十月二十九日死亡，另一人受重伤已送进医院。
    刘真泽说：另一件谋杀案的被害者名叫赵在根。赵在根在十月初就被关在“苦刑室”里，特务们每天在半夜里对他施行酷刑。我方归来人员崔炳玉当时也被囚禁在“苦刑室”里，曾亲眼看到赵在根遭受毒打的情形。崔炳玉说，当赵在根被打得昏迷过去时，“警备队长”白永道和“分队长”严达铉还说他装死，用皮靴乱踢他的肚子。我方归来人员李文协当时住的帐篷距离“苦刑室”仅三公尺左右，也曾听到赵在根被拷打时的惨叫声。归来人员刘真泽说，赵在根被连续打了好几天以后，就被特务们送到“老年小队”住的帐篷里。我方归来人员玄泽钧当时在“老年小队”，曾亲眼看到赵在根被送到“老年小队”来时已被打得浑身皮开肉绽，口吐鲜血，不能说话，不能吃饭喝水。过了约一个星期，即崔元一和朴道元被害四、五天以后，特务们看他实在不能活了，就欺骗印度看管部队说，赵在根已经病了几天，不能吃饭，要马上送到医院去。印度看管部队就派来一辆救护车停在营场门口，特务们命令“老年小队”的四个战俘用毯子裹着赵在根，把他抬进汽车里由印度人运走。运走的情形，所有五十三号营场的我方归来人员都曾亲眼看见。
    赵在根被送去医院后的第四天，印度看管部队通知营场的特务头子说，赵在根到医院后就死了，并说要对赵在根、崔元一、朴道元死亡的情形进行调查，还要五十个战俘作证。特务头子白永道就秘密召集“警备队员”开会，指定了五十个假证人，金允熙和刘真泽也被指定作假证人。当时，白永道命令这五十个假证人说：“在印度人询问时，要说赵在根是病死的，崔元一和朴道元是想爬出铁丝网逃走被‘反共战俘’赶上去打死的，但是不知凶手是谁。”白永道威胁说：“谁要对印度人讲了真话，或向战俘泄露了这件事情，谁就别想活！”
    归来人员刘真泽说：印度看管部队来调查时，在铁丝网外面放了一张桌子，把“证人”一个个叫出去由一个会日语的印度军官询问。特务白永道自动出来充当日语翻译，英语翻译由白永道指定一个姓金的战俘担任。白永道命令姓金的战俘说：“不论证人说什么，你只许照我的话翻译。”印度看管部队对这两件案件共调查了三天，每个“证人”被询问了两次，五十个假证人在特务控制下照?了早就布置好的“证词”。印度军官把“证词”记录下来，让证人签了字。五十个假证人在第一次证词上签的都是真名字。后来，特务白永道害怕将来容易泄露真相，又命令他们在第二次一律签上假名字。金允熙和刘真泽签的假名字是“金洛训”和“李增烈”。
    金允熙说：调查结束后，杀人凶手白永道又把五十个假证人集合起来威胁他们说：“这件事就这样完了，谁也不许泄露秘密，否则就照样处死他，打死人没有关系，在这里是没有法律的！”因此这两件血案一直被隐瞒下来。
    金允熙说：“现在，我作为真正的证人，向全世界揭露李承晚特务谋杀战俘的罪行。谋杀案被隐瞒了将近两个月了，我要求中立国遣返委员会和印度部队重新调查这件谋杀案，逮捕和惩办凶手，为死难者伸冤！”
