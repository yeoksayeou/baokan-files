Xinhua News Agency, December 25th - The Liaison Bureau for Asia and Australia of the World Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram to the Japan National Relief Association, representing millions of workers in Asia and Australia, expressing firm support for the just struggle of the defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" and the Japanese people. The telegram reads as follows: To the Japan National Relief Association:

The Sendai High Court of Japan, in its second-instance judgment, brazenly sentenced the majority of the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" to death and long-term imprisonment on trumped-up charges. This is a fascist crime committed by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries to further intensify the revival of Japanese militarism and further deprive the Japanese people of their basic democratic rights and freedoms.

Millions of workers in Asia and Australia continue to support your just struggle against this reactionary measure.

Xinhua News Agency, December 25th - The All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the National Committee of the China Railway Trade Union sent a telegram to the Japan National Relief Association, firmly supporting the just struggle of all the defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" and the Japanese people, and expressing boundless anger at the Japanese reactionary authorities' shameless crime of persecuting Japanese patriotic workers. The telegram reads as follows: To the Japan National Relief Association:

Ignoring the eloquent evidence and the solemn protests of the broad masses of the Japanese people and peace-loving and justice-upholding people all over the world, U.S. imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries brazenly sentenced seventeen innocent defendants, including Suzuki Shin, in the "Matsukawa Incident" to death and long-term imprisonment. Upon hearing this news, the Chinese working class expressed boundless anger at this shameless crime of the Japanese reactionary authorities in persecuting patriotic workers, and extended the highest respect to the spirit of unyielding struggle of all the defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" in upholding justice.

The facts prove that the "Matsukawa Incident" was fabricated by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries, and that all the defendants, including Suzuki, are innocent. This unreasonable verdict shows that the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are further suppressing the people in order to clear the way for rearming Japan and reviving Japanese militarism, and have openly adopted fascist means to destroy the people's basic democratic rights and freedoms. However, this fascist atrocity of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries will inevitably arouse the anger and condemnation of the broad masses of the Japanese people and the people of the world. We firmly support

the just struggle of all the defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" and the Japanese people.

    声援“松川事件”无辜被告的正义斗争
   【新华社二十五日讯】世界工联亚澳联络局致电日本国民救援会，代表亚洲、澳洲千百万工人表示坚决支持“松川事件”被告和日本人民的正义斗争。电文如下：日本国民救援会：
    日本仙台高等裁判所在第二审判决中，以莫须有的捏造罪名，悍然判处“松川事件”绝大部分无辜被告以死刑与长期徒刑，这是美、日反动派更加紧复活日本军国主义，进一步剥夺日本人民的基本民主权利与自由的法西斯罪行。
    亚洲、澳洲千百万工人继续支持你们反对这一反动措施的正义斗争。

    【新华社二十五日讯】中华全国总工会和中国铁路工会全国委员会致电日本国民救援会，坚决支持“松川事件”全体被告和日本人民的正义斗争，并对日本反动当局迫害日本爱国工人的无耻罪行，表示无比的愤怒。电文如下：日本国民救援会：
    美帝国主义和日本反动派不顾雄辩的事实证明和日本广大人民以及全世界爱好和平与正义的人民的严正抗议，悍然对“松川事件”无辜被告铃木信等十七人判处死刑和长期徒刑。中国工人阶级闻讯之下，对日本反动当局这一迫害爱国工人的无耻罪行，表示无比的愤怒，对“松川事件”全体被告坚持正义的不屈的斗争精神，致以崇高的敬意。
    事实证明“松川事件”是美日反动派制造出来的，而铃木等全体被告是无罪的。这个横蛮无理的判决表明：美日反动派进一步镇压人民以扫清重新武装日本、复活日本军国主义的道路，已公开采取法西斯手段摧残人民的基本民主权利和自由。但是美日反动派的这种法西斯暴行必然会激起日本广大人民和全世界人民的愤怒和谴责。我们坚决支持
    “松川事件”全体被告和日本人民这一正义斗争。
