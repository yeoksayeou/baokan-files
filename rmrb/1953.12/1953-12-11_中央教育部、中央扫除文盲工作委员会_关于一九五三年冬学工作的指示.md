The experiences of many years have proven that winter schools, held during the slack farming season in winter, are one of the important methods to educate peasants politically and culturally. This year, the country has entered a period of planned economic construction. How to use winter schools to publicize the Party's general line and general tasks during the transition period to the peasant masses, to educate peasants to get organized, to increase grain production, and to enthusiastically sell surplus grain to the state to support the national construction is a very important political task. Since the task of rural work is heavy this winter, the cultural education work of winter schools should be implemented appropriately according to the specific conditions of each region, and excessive demands should not be made. Therefore, the following instructions are given:

    I. This year's winter schools should generally focus on political education, which should particularly emphasize the general line of national economic construction, the state's grain policy, and the continued development of mutual aid and cooperation, the improvement of agricultural technology, and the increase of grain production. In addition, it should also be appropriately linked to the publicity of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, the general election, and the Marriage Law. Political education materials or outlines should be compiled by each region. Political teachers should be arranged by each county according to local conditions. Winter schools should follow the usual practice of political lessons, with each lesson having a central theme, preferably focusing on a single topic. In addition to the original winter school students, general masses should be encouraged and organized to attend the lectures as much as possible. When teachers give political lessons, they should strive to appropriately answer the peasants' questions and concerns in light of the ideological situation of the local peasants.

      II. The cultural learning of winter schools should still use the "Peasant Literacy Textbook" published last year as teaching material, and each region should determine its own learning progress according to last year's experience and this year's situation. In view of the fact that winter schools and people's schools have been running for many years, and not all peasants are illiterate, this year efforts should be made to classify illiterates and semi-illiterates into different classes (or groups) according to their cultural level; however, in places where winter schools are newly established, or where the level is relatively uniform, or where there are not enough teachers, only one type of class can still be opened. The learning requirements for students with poorer learning conditions, such as women with many children, peasants who are busy with winter sideline production, etc., should be lower than those of general students. The focus of cultural education should be on improving the cultural level of young men and women and adult peasants, and eliminating illiteracy and semi-illiteracy among them, which is very important for national construction. In order to quickly improve the cultural level of peasants, special attention should be paid to grasping the education of illiterates. With more literate people, it will be easier for them to eliminate illiteracy.

    III. Improving the political and cultural level of rural cadres and activists has a great impact on correctly implementing various government policies in rural areas and doing a good job in various rural tasks. However, in view of the fact that rural cadres and activists urgently need to improve their culture, but are often busy with work, they often take the lead in entering winter schools, but cannot attend classes regularly, resulting in poor performance compared to general students, and even losing confidence in cultural learning, and in view of the heavy task of rural work this winter, this problem must be appropriately and effectively solved. All regions should use winter schools to plan and organize all or part of the rural cadres and activists to learn culture under the conditions of not hindering work and winter production. Past experience has proven that it is feasible to have rural cadres and activists take turns to learn, and to put them in separate classes (groups) in winter schools. These methods can be adopted by each region according to specific circumstances.

    IV. The experience of the past year has proven that it is effective for peasants to appropriately adopt the accelerated literacy method in winter school education with longer learning time. However, it is not feasible to mechanically use the accelerated literacy method as the only method in rural areas. This is because the production, life and learning conditions of peasants are different, so only one method cannot be adopted, and the same progress cannot be required. This year, in winter schools, different teaching methods should be adopted according to the situation, different places, different teachers, and different students. In a few places where conditions are fully met (i.e., 1. There are teachers who understand the accelerated literacy method, 2. Students are willing, 3. Students are easy to concentrate and have time to blitz literacy), the accelerated literacy method of "segmented blitz, segmented consolidation" can be adopted; in places where conditions are not met or the conditions are incomplete, other teaching methods can be adopted, including the method of teaching three to five characters each time. However, in the actual teaching work, attention must be paid to creating and summarizing experience, so that we can strive to adopt a more progressive teaching method that is suitable for rural areas in rural literacy education. We hope that all regions will report their experience in this regard to the Central Illiteracy Eradication Work Committee.

    V. Political teachers for winter schools should be planned and resolved by each county. Cultural teachers should mainly rely on local spare-time teachers who do not leave production. Elementary school teachers have heavy tasks, and they should generally be allowed to rest during the winter vacation. They can only be invited to do tutoring work as spare-time teachers. If it is absolutely necessary, do not mobilize them to teach winter schools. For the original students of winter schools and people's schools who have learned about 2,000 characters, they should be trained to become winter school teachers, who will become the main force of winter school teachers in the future. Do not make excessive demands on spare-time teachers. They should be given professional guidance so that they can gradually progress and become good winter school teachers.

    VI. Regarding the issue of winter school funding, in addition to teacher training and a certain amount of reward fees being paid by the people's government, all other expenses should be mainly raised by the masses themselves, but when it is really necessary, the people's government may give appropriate subsidies. For many years, the masses have had traditional methods of maintaining winter school funding, and these methods vary from place to place. These methods should be studied, and good methods should be promoted. Methods that are not good and not approved by the masses should be changed.

    VII. Due to the fact that in the past winter school work, the phenomenon of simply pursuing numbers and the phenomenon of lack of planning were relatively serious, and due to the heavy task of rural work this winter, all regions must pay attention to the leadership and control of winter school work, on the one hand, to prevent the phenomenon of impracticality and pursuit of numbers in winter school work, and to prevent the status of winter school work from being put inappropriately so as to hinder the completion of the central task, and on the other hand, to prevent a negative attitude towards winter schools, not actively using winter schools to help complete the central task, and causing dissatisfaction among peasants who want to learn literacy. This year's winter schools must be combined with the central work of rural areas to carry out publicity and mobilization, and there must still be an appropriate part of rural cadres and activists to lead and organize this matter, but the students who enroll must be voluntary, and there must be teachers and funds, so that the winter school will not be interrupted halfway.

    Winter school work should be carried out under the unified leadership of the Party and the People's Government, mainly by the education administrative departments and illiteracy eradication work committees at all levels, in conjunction with the Communist Youth League, the Women's Federation and other relevant parties. Above the county level, representatives from the above-mentioned parties can form a winter school work committee to be responsible for managing this year's winter school work.

    VIII. All regions should conduct serious investigation and research in this year's winter school work to understand the students, teachers, funding, teaching methods, teaching effectiveness, and problems in the work of winter schools. In order to plan the winter schools of 1954 in advance and be able to prepare early, all regions should formulate a plan for the winter school work of next year when summarizing the winter school work in the coming spring, and report it to the provincial government level by level. The provincial government should report it to the major administrative region and the Central Illiteracy Eradication Work Committee before the end of June 1954 at the same time. The winter school work plan of the major administrative region should be reported to the Central Illiteracy Eradication Work Committee before mid-July 1954.

    中央教育部、中央扫除文盲工作委员会
    关于一九五三年冬学工作的指示
    多年的经验证明，利用冬季农闲季节举办的冬学，是从政治上和文化上教育农民的重要方法之一。今年国家已进入有计划的经济建设时期，如何利用冬学向农民群众宣传国家在过渡时期的总路线和总任务，教育农民组织起来，提高粮食产量，并把余粮踊跃地卖给国家，以支援国家建设事业，乃是一项十分重要的政治工作。由于今冬农村工作任务繁重，冬学的文化教育工作应根据各地具体情况，酌量施行，不能要求过高。为此特作如下指示：
    一、今年冬学，一般以进行政治教育为主，其内容应特别注重关于国家经济建设的总路线，国家对粮食的政策和继续发展互助合作，改进农业技术，提高粮食产量等三项。此外还应适当地联系到抗美援朝、普选和婚姻法的宣传等。政治教育的教材或提纲，由各地编写。政治教员由各县根据当地情况设法解决。冬学应依照向来习惯上政治课，每课应有中心，最好是集中讲一个题目。上课时除原有的冬学学员外，应尽量号召和组织一般群众来听讲。教员讲政治课时要力求针对当地农民的思想情况恰当地解答他们的疑问和顾虑。
      二、冬学的文化学习，仍用去年出版的“农民识字课本”为教材，由各地根据去年经验和今年情况，自行规定学习进度。鉴于冬学、民校已办了多年，农民中已经不全是文盲，今年应力求将文盲和半文盲依其文化程度分别编班（或编组）学习；但在初办冬学、或程度比较一致或教师不够的地方，仍可只开一种班次。对于学习条件较差的学员，如孩子多的妇女，冬季副业生产较忙的农民等，学习的要求应当较一般学员放低。文化教育的重心，应放在使男女青年和壮年农民提高文化水平，扫除其中的文盲和半文盲，这对于国家的建设是很重要的。为了迅速提高农民的文化水平，应特别注意抓紧教育文盲，识字的人多了，经过他们去扫除文盲也更容易了。
    三、提高农村干部、积极分子的政治文化水平，对正确贯彻政府在农村中的各种政策和做好农村的各项工作，有极大的作用。但鉴于农村干部、积极分子虽迫切需要提高文化，惟因工作较忙，在冬学中往往带头入学，但不能经常上课，以致成绩不如一般学员，甚至丧失对文化学习的信心，又鉴于今冬农村工作任务繁重，因此必须适当地切实解决这个问题。各地应在不妨碍工作和冬季生产的条件下，运用冬学有计划地组织全部或一部分农村干部、积极分子学文化。以往经验证明，使农村干部、积极分子轮流学习，和在冬学中把他们另行编班（组）的办法是可行的。这些办法各地可根据具体情况采用。
    四、一年来的经验证明在学习时间较长的冬学教育中，农民学习文化适当地采取速成识字法是有效的。但在农村中一律机械地以速成识字法作为唯一的方法，这是行不通的。这是因为农民生产、生活和学习的情况各有不同，因此就不能只采取一种方法，要求一样进度。今年在冬学中，应依据情况，不同地方、不同教员、不同学员，采取不同的教法。在少数完全有条件（即一、有懂得速成识字法的教员，二、学员自愿，三、学员容易集中和有时间突击识字）的地方，可采取“分段突击、分段巩固”的速成识字法；在没有条件和条件不完备的地方可采取其他教法，包括每次教三五个字的方法在内。但必须在实际教学工作中注意创造和总结经验，使我们能在农村识字教育中力求采取比较进步而又适合于农村的教学方法。并希各地将这方面的经验，报告中央扫除文盲工作委员会。
    五、冬学政治教员应由各县筹划解决。文化教员应主要依靠当地不脱离生产的业余教师担任。小学教员任务繁重，寒假一般的应让他们休息，只可请他们作业余教员的辅导工作，非不得已不要动员他们来教冬学。对已经识了大约两千字的原来冬学和民校的学员，应培养他们成为冬学教员，他们将来会成为冬学教员的主力。对业余教员，不要要求过高，对他们要进行业务指导，使他们逐渐进步，成为好的冬学教员。
    六、关于冬学经费问题，除教师训练和一定数量的奖励费由人民政府开支外，其他一切费用均以群众自筹为主，但确有必要时，人民政府可酌情予以补助。多年以来，群众中有维持冬学经费的传统办法，并且各地不同。这些办法，应加以研究，把好的办法推广出去，不好的为群众所不赞成的办法，应加以改变。
    七、由于过去在冬学工作中，单纯追求数字现象和无计划现象比较严重，又由于今冬农村工作繁重，因此，各地必须注意对冬学工作的领导与掌握，一方面防止冬学工作中的不切实际、追求数字的现象，防止把冬学工作的地位放得不适当以致妨碍中心任务的完成，另一方面又要防止对冬学采取消极态度，不积极利用冬学来帮助完成中心任务，并引起要求识字的农民的不满。今年办冬学，必须结合农村中心工作进行宣传动员，仍要有适当的一部分农村干部、积极分子来领导和组织这件事，但入学的学员必须是自愿的，并必须有教员，有经费，不致使冬学中途停顿。
    冬学工作，应在党和人民政府的统一领导下，以各级教育行政部门和扫除文盲工作委员会为主，联合青年团、妇联等有关方面来进行。县以上可以由上述几方面的代表，组成冬学工作委员会，负责管理今年的冬学工作。
    八、各地应在今年的冬学工作中认真进行调查研究，了解冬学的学员、教员、经费、教法、教学效果，和工作中的问题。为了使一九五四年的冬学预先有计划，并能早作准备，各地应在明春总结冬学工作时，拟出明年冬学工作的计划，层报省政府，省政府限于一九五四年六月底以前同时报送大行政区和中央扫除文盲工作委员会。大行政区的明年冬学工作计划，应于一九五四年七月中旬以前报告中央扫除文盲工作委员会。
