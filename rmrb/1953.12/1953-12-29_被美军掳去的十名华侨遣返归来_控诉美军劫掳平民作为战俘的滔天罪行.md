Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 26th: Among the more than sixty personnel from our side who recently returned after explanations, ten were Chinese nationals who had resided in North Korea for a long time. After returning, they angrily denounced the U.S. imperialism for violating the 1949 Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War by kidnapping civilians as prisoners of war, making them victims of American "psychological warfare."

    The returned overseas Chinese, Wen Chuansheng, originally resided in Xizhoudong, Dingzhou County, northern Korea. When the U.S.-Syngman Rhee bandit troops frantically advanced north in 1950, his three new houses were bombed by American planes, and he and his family suffered much insult and persecution. On the night of November 26th of that year, Wen Chuansheng suddenly heard two gunshots outside his door, followed by American soldiers kicking open the door. Before he could even dress properly, he was forcibly dragged out by American soldiers armed with live ammunition. About twenty miles from Dingzhou, Wen Chuansheng saw twenty-seven other kidnapped overseas Chinese and more than twenty North Korean civilians. The American soldiers divided them into two rows, forced them to kneel and raise their hands, and then robbed them of their money, gold rings, watches, and other valuables. Wen Chuansheng took out his residency permit to prove his civilian status, but it was immediately torn up by the American soldiers. Later, the American soldiers treated them as prisoners of war and escorted them south.

    Wen Chuansheng saw that among the overseas Chinese illegally kidnapped with him, one man's wife was shot and killed by American soldiers. When this overseas Chinese and others went to bury her, the American brutes even shot at the crowd and forced them to continue south with guns. Among the overseas Chinese illegally kidnapped by the U.S. side, there were also a sixty-one-year-old man and a child who was only fifteen years old.

    During the march south, the American brutes used all kinds of cruel methods to torture these unarmed Korean and Chinese civilians. Many of them were forced to walk in the cold snow wearing only thin clothes, and if they could not walk, they would be beaten with wooden sticks. All they ate each day were two pieces of ice-hard barley rice balls, and they drank cold water mixed with ice shavings. Sometimes they did not eat a bite of food for two or three days, and some people were tortured to death on the way. One night, Wen Chuansheng saw dozens of weak North Korean civilians forced to spend the night in the snow, and by the next day, fifteen of them had frozen to death. Wen Chuansheng and others repeatedly explained their civilian status to the U.S. military and their translators, but these guys initially deceived them by saying, "You will be released soon after going further south." Later, when they said they were civilians, the U.S. military cursed and beat them mindlessly with sticks.

    The U.S. military finally sent these civilians to prisoner-of-war camps and handed them over to Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek secret agents for torture, and they were portrayed as prisoners of war who "would rather die than be repatriated." They were assigned to different squads and different classes, and were closely monitored by secret agents every day, forbidden to say a word to each other. The kidnapped old man Fei Yunting often fainted from hunger, and Wen Chuansheng suffered from pulmonary hemoptysis and never received treatment. During the forced "screening," the secret agents brutally beat, cut flesh, and gouged out the hearts of prisoners of war who wanted to return home, and said viciously to these overseas Chinese: "You will be treated like this if you want to return home!" Each of them was also forced to have reactionary slogans tattooed on their bodies. Before being handed over to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, the secret agents specially arranged for three people to monitor each one of them, threatening these overseas Chinese with death every day. Ding Zhengxing, the deputy leader of the secret service brigade of the third camp of the Dongchang-ri prisoner-of-war camp under U.S. command, roared and threatened these overseas Chinese on the eve of the explanations, saying, "If anyone says they were captured civilians during the explanations, and makes the Americans lose face, they will be caught back and smashed to death!"

    Wen Chuansheng said that despite the vicious arrangements made by the U.S. imperialists, who could not miss their families and children! Wen Chuansheng had lived in North Korea for twenty-eight years, and he clearly remembered the suffering he had endured under Japanese rule and the happy life after liberation. After liberation, he participated in the construction of the Korean railway, and his four children were taken care of by the Republic government and attended school for free. The Republic government also specially allocated three new houses for him to live in. Old man Fei Yunting had been unemployed before the "August 15th" liberation. After liberation, the Republic government distributed more than 1,300 ping of land to his family and loaned him money to buy a plow ox, which improved his family's life day by day. They secretly told themselves that they would return to the Republic and the motherland at the first opportunity.

    On the 21st, Wen Chuansheng entered the explanation tent and angrily pointed at the U.S. observer representative and complained to the members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission: "I am a civilian and have lived in North Korea for twenty-eight years. Why did the Americans capture me as a prisoner of war? And forcibly detain us and not allow us to go home?" The American observer representative embarrassedly blushed and lowered his head. When old man Fei Yunting listened to the explanation on the 22nd, he also said with tears in his eyes to the explanation representative: "I am so old, and the Americans still captured me as a prisoner of war! For three years, they beat me, scolded me, and the suffering I have endured is truly beyond words!" The accusations of Wen Chuansheng and Fei Yunting in the explanation tent aroused the sympathy of impartial Neutral Nations personnel.

    After returning, Wen Shengchuan and other ten suffering overseas Chinese issued an appeal, saying: In Dongchang-ri, there are still many civilians and Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who cannot return under the violent control of secret agents. They said: We cannot allow U.S. imperialism to deprive them of their right to listen to explanations and demand to return home and live a peaceful life!

    被美军掳去的十名华侨遣返归来
    控诉美军劫掳平民作为战俘的滔天罪行
   【新华社开城二十六日电】最近听解释后回来的六十多名我方被俘人员中，有十名是久居在北朝鲜的中国侨民。在遣返归来后，他们愤怒地控诉美帝国主义违反一九四九年日内瓦战时保护平民公约劫掳平民作为战俘，使他们成为美国“心理战”的牺牲品。
    归来华侨温传盛原来侨居在朝鲜北部定州郡西州洞。一九五零年美李匪军疯狂北犯时，他的三间新房子都被美国飞机炸坏了，他和他的家属也受了许多侮辱和迫害。那年十一月二十六日夜里，温传盛听到门外忽然响起两声枪响，跟着大门就被美国兽兵踢开，他衣服也没有穿好，就被荷枪实弹的美国兵强拉着往外走。走到离定州约二十里的地方，温传盛看见了另外被抓来的二十七个华侨和二十多个北朝鲜老百姓。美国兵把他们分成两排，强迫他们跪着举起双手，然后把他们的钱、金戒指、手表等贵重物品都抢光。温传盛拿出他的居留证表明自己的平民身份，立刻被美国兵撕掉了。后来，美国兵就把他们当作战俘往南押送。
    温传盛看见和他同时被非法掳去的华侨中，有一个人的妻子被美国兵开枪打死，当这个华侨和其他的人前去埋葬时，美国兽兵竟又朝人群射击，并用枪逼着他们继续往南走。在被美方非法掳去的华侨中，还有六十一岁的老大爷和刚十五岁的孩子。
    在往南押送的途中，美国兽兵更以种种残酷的手段来折磨这些手无寸铁的朝中平民。他们很多人只穿着单薄的衣服，被美国兵强迫着在寒冷的雪地中行走，走不动就用木棒朝身上打。他们每天所吃到的只是两块冰硬的大麦饭团，喝的是混着冰屑的冷水，有时甚至两三天吃不到一口饭，有些人在路上就被折磨死了。一天夜里，温传盛看见几十个羸弱得站立不住的北朝鲜老百姓被迫在雪地里过夜，到第二天，便有十五个人被活活冻死了。温传盛等曾屡次向美军和他们的翻译说明自己的平民身份，这些家伙最初欺骗他们说：“再往南走不远就可以释放你们。”以后他们说自己是平民时，美军就一边大骂，一边拿起棍棒没头没脑地打他们。
    美军终于把这些平民送到战俘营里，交给李、蒋特务折磨。并且把他们说成是“宁死不愿遣返”的战俘。他们被编入不同的小队和不同的班，每天由特务严密监视，不准他们互相说一句话。被掳的费云廷老大爷常常饿得昏倒，温传盛患着肺咯血，也一直得不到治疗。在强迫“甄别”时，特务们把愿意回国的战俘毒打、割肉、挖心，并且狠毒地对这些华侨说：“你们要回国也是这个样子！”他们每个人的身上也都被强迫刺上了反动口号。在送交中立国看管前，特务们还专门布置三个人监视他们一个人，天天用死来威胁这些华侨。美方指挥下的东场里战俘营第三号营场特务大队副丁正兴在听解释前夕，对这些华侨咆哮恫吓说：“你们听解释时谁要说出是被抓来的老百姓，丢了美国人的脸，抓回来就要砸死你们！”
    温传盛说，尽管美帝国主义者作了如此狠毒的布置，但谁能不惦念自己的家庭和孩子啊！温传盛在北朝鲜住了二十八年，他清楚地记得在日本统治时所遭受的痛苦和解放后的幸福生活。他在解放后参加了朝鲜的铁道建设工作，四个孩子都由共和国政府照顾免费上学，共和国政府还特地拨三间新房子给他居住。费云廷老大爷在“八·一五”解放前曾失过业，解放后共和国政府分给他家一千三百多坪土地，又贷给他款子买了一头耕牛，使他家的生活一天天改善。他们暗暗对自己说，一有机会就回到共和国和祖国去。
    二十一日，温传盛进入解释帐篷后就愤怒地指着美方观察代表向中立国遣返委员会人员控诉说： “我是一个老百姓，在北朝鲜住了二十八年。美国人为什么把我抓来当战俘？还强迫扣留我们不准回家？”这个美国观察代表狼狈地红着脸把头低了下去。费云廷老大爷在二十二日听解释时，也含着眼泪向解释代表说：“我这么大年纪啦，美国人还把我抓来当战俘！三年来，他们打我、骂我，我受的苦真是一言难尽啊！”温传盛和费云廷在解释帐篷中的控诉，引起了公正的中立国人士的同情。
    温盛传等十名受难的华侨归来后发出呼吁说：在东场里，还有不少平民和朝中被俘人员在特务的暴力控制下不能回来。他们说：不能让美帝国主义剥夺他们听取解释和要求回家过和平生活的权利！
