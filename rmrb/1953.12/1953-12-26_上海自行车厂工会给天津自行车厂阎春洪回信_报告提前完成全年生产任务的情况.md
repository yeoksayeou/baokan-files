Shanghai Bicycle Factory Union's Reply to Comrade Yan Chunhong of Tianjin Bicycle Factory
Reporting on Early Completion of Annual Production Task
Comrade Yan Chunhong of Tianjin Bicycle Factory:

    We have received the letter you sent us (published in the People's Daily on October 18th). You responded to Chairman Mao's call for increased production and conservation, actively seeking methods and creating automated devices to improve labor productivity and accelerate the construction of our country's socialist industrialization. Our entire staff is determined to learn from your work ethic.

    Our entire staff launched a campaign for increased production and conservation starting in the fourth quarter to ensure the early and over-fulfillment of the state plan. The announcement of your letter in our factory further encouraged everyone's enthusiasm and promoted the further development of our labor competition. Thanks to the efforts of all employees, we have already completed the annual production task ahead of schedule and are striving to over fulfill the plan for increased production and conservation. We are now informing you of our factory's plan for increased production and conservation and the competition situation.

    At the beginning of the increased production and conservation competition, we formulated the following plan: First, guarantee an increase in production and conservation of 8.6 billion yuan for the whole year. Second, ensure the completion of the annual total output value twenty days ahead of schedule. Third, the balance rate of the assembly workshop in each month of the fourth quarter will reach 85 percent. Fourth, reduce costs by 4 percent in the fourth quarter. Fifth, reduce and eliminate work-related injuries, and ensure that the attendance rate of all production workers in the factory is above 94 percent.

    To ensure the completion and over-fulfillment of the above plan, we paid attention to the following specific tasks: First, strengthen ideological education for workers and continuously promote the development of the increased production and conservation competition. Second, systematically implement the operation plan, improve the production balance rate, and organize rhythmic production. Third, further carry out the rationalization proposal campaign, focusing on weak links, organizing technical personnel to combine with workers, improve working methods, and improve labor productivity. Fourth, strictly abide by the inspection system, abide by operating procedures, and continue to consolidate labor discipline.

    In the competition, the comrades of the staff showed a high degree of enthusiasm. In the first month of our competition—October—the total output of bicycles increased by 15.5 percent compared with September. Comrade Ruan Ashui and other comrades in the paint group improved the method of loading bicycle frames in the infrared oven, which increased the output by nearly one time and saved nearly 80 million yuan in electricity costs for the country throughout the year. The whole group is now further studying how to reduce the paint process. Part machinist Yao Renqing used multi-blade cutting method to make the output exceed the new quota by 120 percent. The output of the handlebar and steel rim polishing group averaged 20 percent over the new quota, and is also preparing to further use sandblasting to reduce the physical labor of filing copper welding (this method has been tested successfully and is only waiting for the installation of machines).

    After studying the state's general line and general tasks during the transition period, the production enthusiasm of the staff was even higher. Now, we have completed the annual total output value twenty-one days ahead of schedule (one day ahead of the original plan), completed the production task of the main product bicycles fifteen days ahead of schedule (five days ahead of the original plan), and completed the production task of bicycle chains forty days ahead of schedule. The profit turned over to the state also exceeded the annual state plan on November 10. However, we will never be satisfied with the existing achievements. We know that there are still many areas in our factory's work that need to be improved. All our employees are determined to work harder to increase production and save 11.2 billion yuan of wealth for the country by the end of the year (the original plan was 8.6 billion yuan) and make the profit turned over to the state exceed the state plan by 83 percent. Under the light of the general line, we are fully confident of completing this plan. We hope to strengthen ties with your factory in the future, learn from your advanced experience, and contribute more to the country's socialist industrialization!

    上海自行车厂工会给天津自行车厂阎春洪回信
    报告提前完成全年生产任务的情况天津自行车厂阎春洪同志：
    你寄给我们的信（刊十月十八日人民日报）收到了。你响应毛主席增产节约号召，积极找窍门，创造自动装置，提高劳动生产率，来加速我们祖国社会主义工业化的建设。我们全体职工决心学习你的工作精神。
    我们全体职工从第四季度起展开了增产节约竞赛，来保证国家计划的提前与超额完成。你的信在我厂公布以后，更鼓舞了大家的热情，使我们的劳动竞赛有了进一步的开展。在全体职工的努力下，我们已经提前完成了全年生产任务，并正在争取超额完成增产节约计划。现在我们把我厂增产节约计划和竞赛情况告诉你。
    在增产节约竞赛开始时，我们订出了如下的计划：一，保证全年增产节约八十六亿元。二，保证提前二十天完成全年生产总值。三，第四季度各月装配车间的均衡率达到百分之八十五。四，第四季度降低成本百分之四。五，减少和消灭工伤事故，并保证全厂生产工人的出勤率在百分之九十四以上。
    为了保证上述计划的完成与超额完成，我们注意了下列几项具体工作：一，加强对工人的思想教育，不断地推进增产节约竞赛的发展。二，有步骤地推行作业计划，提高生产均衡率，组织有节奏的生产。三，进一步开展合理化建议运动，针对薄弱环节，组织技术人员与工人结合起来，改进工作方法，提高劳动生产率。四，严格遵守检验制度，遵守操作规程，并继续巩固劳动纪律。
    在竞赛中，职工同志们发挥了高度的积极性。我们竞赛展开的头一个月——十月份，自行车的总产量比九月份提高了百分之十五点五。油漆组的阮阿水等同志改进了在红内线烘炉中烘车架子的装车方法，使产量提高了将近一倍，并为国家全年节约电费近八千万元，现在全组正在进一步研究如何减少油漆工序的问题。零件车工姚仁青同志使用多刀多刃切削法，使产量超过新定额百分之一百二十。把手及钢圈抛光组产量平均超过新定额百分之二十，还准备进一步采用喷砂的办法来减少锉铜焊的体力劳动（这个方法已试验成功，只待设置机器）。
    经过学习国家在过渡时期的总路线和总任务以后，职工同志们的生产热情更高了。现在，我们已经提前二十一天完成了全年生产总值（比原计划提前一天），提前十五天完成了主要产品自行车的生产任务（比原计划提前五天），提前四十天完成了自行车链条的生产任务，上缴利润也在十一月十日超额完成了全年国家计划。但是，我们决不满足于已有的成绩。我们知道：现在我们厂的工作需要改进的地方还很多。我们全体职工决心进一步努力，争取到年底为国家增产节约一百十二亿元的财富（原计划是八十六亿元），并使上缴利润超过国家计划百分之八十三。在总路线的光芒照耀下，我们完全有把握完成这个计划。我们希望今后和你厂加强联系，学习你们的先进经验，为国家社会主义工业化献出更大的力量！
