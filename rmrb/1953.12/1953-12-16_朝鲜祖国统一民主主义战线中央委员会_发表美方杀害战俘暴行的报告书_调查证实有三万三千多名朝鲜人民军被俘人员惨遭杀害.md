    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 15th—According to the Korean Central News Agency, it has now been confirmed that the number of captured Korean People's Army soldiers murdered by the U.S. aggressors has reached more than 33,000. The report on the atrocities of the U.S. aggressors against captured Korean People's Army soldiers, recently published by the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland of Korea, reveals this shocking fact.
    This report was written based on the irrefutable materials obtained from a careful review of numerous accusations from captured personnel who had witnessed and personally suffered the atrocities of the U.S. aggressors in various POW camps on the U.S. side.
    Among the already repatriated captured Korean People's Army soldiers, many narrowly survived the bloody massacres of POWs by the U.S. side, and many still bear scars from persecution and torture by the enemy. All unquestionable evidence proves that the U.S. aggressors trampled on the Geneva Conventions and international laws, inflicting heinous atrocities on the POWs. This evidence includes consistent testimonies from many repatriated POWs regarding the various atrocities committed by the U.S. aggressors and various physical evidence and records they brought back, the reactionary slogans and symbols branded onto the POWs by the U.S. military authorities to force their detention, the scars all over the bodies of POWs left after being subjected to torture and poison, the deformities and disabilities caused by being used as medical experiments, the symptoms of many POWs suffering from mental illness, and the lung diseases suffered by many POWs due to malnutrition.
    The report of the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland of Korea pointed out: In order to suppress, abuse, and kill POWs, the U.S. military authorities used weapons such as bayonets, automatic rifles, carbines, machine guns, large-caliber cannons, grenades, poison gas bombs, flamethrowers, armored vehicles, and tanks, as well as army, navy and air force forces such as paratrooper units, jet aircraft, and warships, and used all barbaric methods of persecution, such as electrocution, pouring chili water, pouring cold water, vicious beatings with whips and sticks, pouring cold water on POWs in the severe winter of minus twenty degrees Celsius, forcing female POWs to parade naked in the streets, pulling out fingernails, pulling out hair, applying branding irons, nailing nails into the head, running them over with tanks, throwing them into boiling water to scald them to death, drowning them, burying them alive, beating them to death, using wolfhounds to bite them to death, pouring gasoline on them and burning them to death, skinning them alive, shooting them, dismembering them, and so on. Not only that, but the U.S. aggressors also used POWs as targets for testing the performance and penetration of rifles and machine guns, as subjects for atomic and bacteriological weapons and medical experiments.
    The report pointed out: The main reason why the U.S. aggressors committed such unprecedented atrocities was to forcibly detain POWs to serve as cannon fodder and to collect information about the Korean People's Army from them and force them to act as secret agents for political and military purposes. Therefore, these atrocities were universally committed in all POW camps on the U.S. side due to the attempt to use captured personnel to achieve certain political goals. This was also an atrocity committed from beginning to end, in a planned and organized manner.
    The report of the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland of Korea once again exposed the brutal barbarity and corrupt nature of the U.S. aggressors, the enemy of mankind, and more thoroughly exposed the truth about the so-called "voluntary repatriation" fraud fabricated by the U.S. imperialists in order to forcibly detain POWs. This report is an indictment against the U.S. aggressors for the sake of defending peace, civilization, and morality.

    朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会
    发表美方杀害战俘暴行的报告书
    调查证实有三万三千多名朝鲜人民军被俘人员惨遭杀害
    【新华社平壤十五日电】据朝鲜中央通讯社讯：到现在为止，已经证实被美国侵略者杀害的朝鲜人民军被俘人员为数达三万三千多名。朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会最近发表的关于美国侵略者对朝鲜人民军被俘人员的暴行的报告书，揭露了这个骇人听闻的事实。
    这个报告书是慎重地审核了那些曾在美方各战俘营中目睹和亲身蒙受美国侵略者暴行的被俘人员们的许多控诉书并根据调查所得的确凿材料写成的。
    在已经遣返的朝鲜人民军被俘人员中，有许多人是在美方对战俘的血腥屠杀中侥幸生还的，许多人的身上还留着遭受敌人迫害和毒刑的伤痕。一切不容怀疑的证据，都证明美国侵略者蹂躏日内瓦公约和国际法规，对战俘施以令人发指的暴行。这些证据包括许多已遣返的被俘人员关于美国侵略者制造各种暴行的一致的证言和他们带回来的各种证物、记录，美军当局为强迫扣留被俘人员而刺在他们身上的反动口号和标志，被俘人员在受拷问和毒刑以后留下的遍体鳞伤，由于被作为医学试验而造成的畸形和残废，许多患精神病的被俘人员的症状，很多被俘人员由于营养不良而患肺病等。
    朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会的报告书中指出：美军当局为了压制、虐待和杀害战俘，曾使用了刺刀、自动步枪、卡宾枪、机关枪、大口径炮、手榴弹、毒气弹、火焰喷射器、装甲车、坦克等武器和伞兵部队、喷气式飞机、军舰等陆海空军武装，并使用了一切野蛮的迫害方法，例如电刑、灌辣椒水、灌冷水、用皮鞭和棍棒毒打、在零下二十多度的严冬向战俘浇冷水、强迫女战俘裸体在街上游行、拔指甲、拔头发、施烙刑、在头上钉钉子、用坦克辗死、投入开水锅里烫死、淹死、活埋、打死、用狼犬咬死、浇汽油烧死、剥皮、枪杀、碎尸等等。不但如此，美国侵略者还曾把战俘作为试验步枪和机关枪的性能和贯穿力的靶子，作为原子武器和细菌武器及医学的试验对象。
    报告书指出：美国侵略者所以要制造这种史无前例的暴行，主要是企图达到强迫扣留战俘充当它的炮灰，并企图从他们那里搜集有关朝鲜人民军的情报和迫使他们充当特务等政治、军事目的。因此，这种暴行是由于企图利用被俘人员来达到一定的政治目的，而在美方的所有战俘营里普遍制造的。这也是有始有终、有计划、有组织地制造的暴行。
    朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会的报告书再一次地揭露了人类公敌美国侵略者的残暴野蛮和腐败的本质，并更加彻底地揭露了美帝国主义者为了强迫扣留战俘而制造的所谓“自愿遣返”骗局的真相。这个报告书是为了保卫和平、文明和道德而提出的对美国侵略者的起诉书。
