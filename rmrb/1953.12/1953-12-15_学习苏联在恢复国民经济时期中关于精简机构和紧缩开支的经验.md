    Learning from the Soviet Union's Experience in Streamlining Institutions and Tightening Expenditures During the Period of Economic Recovery
    Ma Jianmin
    During the period of economic recovery, the Soviet Union encountered many serious difficulties, particularly the difficulty of a lack of funds. In a letter to the Fifth All-Russian Congress of Trade Unions in September 1922, Lenin said, "Our situation is particularly difficult because we lack the means to restore fixed capital, that is, machinery, tools, housing, etc." [1] Under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union came up with many ways and measures to overcome the financial difficulties during the period of economic recovery, and constantly paying attention to streamlining institutions and tightening expenditures was also a very important experience.
    In 1921, the resolution of the 11th All-Russian Conference of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on "The Party's Current Tasks in Economic Recovery" first pointed out the importance of tightening expenditures, believing that "it is impossible to restore the national economy without resolutely tightening the state budget." Therefore, it was decided that "the expenditures of the Soviet Republic and all its central and local organs should be reduced to the minimum." The resolution further clearly pointed out:
    "To develop national large-scale industry—the foundation of the proletarian dictatorship—requires concentrating the largest part of the state's material reserves—raw materials, grain, fuel, and currency—in the hands of the state, and distributing these material reserves in a planned manner to ensure uninterrupted production work of enterprises relying on state supply. It is necessary to ensure that these enterprises have grain and currency funds to guarantee that workers in each enterprise improve their labor productivity. In order to carry out this task, it is necessary to further and resolutely reduce Soviet organs." [2]
    In order to reduce state expenditures, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee issued instructions on October 10, 1921, calling on the people to work hard to increase revenue and reduce expenditure, protect the interests of the people's treasury in every possible way, and instructing all organs to strictly implement the budget system: (1) strictly prepare financial budgets based on production plans and their work programs; (2) prepare and submit budgets within the prescribed time limit; those who fail to submit budgets on time shall be subject to court sanctions; (3) unauthorized expenditures and overspending are not allowed, and violators shall be held legally responsible; (4) strictly abide by the principle of unified revenue and expenditure; (5) promptly transfer loans to local areas; (6) strictly abide by the method of earmarked loans, etc.
    At the beginning of the New Economic Policy, the number of people supplied with rations by the state, including the army, was about 35 million, which was one of the important reasons for the Soviet fiscal deficit at that time. This was unsustainable for the state. In order to solve this problem, the resolution of the 11th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on financial policy emphasized: "When fighting against the budget deficit, it must first be clearly realized that the Soviet state does not have sufficient economic reserves, especially financial reserves, to support such a huge administrative and economic structure left over from the previous period. … The Soviet state must resolutely 'get rid of this excessive burden' in the short term." It also said: "… It is necessary to vigorously reduce administrative organs, reduce the number of central and local government organs, transfer some expenditures to local budgets, and cancel all expenditures unrelated to directly supporting the existence of the proletarian state from the state budget." [3]
    The Soviet government took many measures: enterprises implemented economic accounting, small enterprises were leased, special committees were established to review and reduce the number of organs and their staffing, and a new wage system was implemented. As a result, in early 1922, 6 million people were supplied by the state budget, including workers in enterprises that had not yet been transferred to economic accounting, but a year later, there were only 2.8 million people.
      Lenin further clearly pointed out that it is necessary to cut down on various unnecessary committees. He said, "Therefore, it should be noted that the various committees within the Council of People's Commissars and the Labor and Defense Council should be reduced, so that they know and solve their own affairs, instead of dispersing matters to countless committees. All the committees have been cleaned up in the last few days. There are a total of one hundred and twenty committees of various kinds. How many are truly necessary? Only sixteen. And this is not the first time to clean up." [4] The resolution of the 12th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) also pointed out: to "fight against the establishment of various accidental temporary committees such as investigation, guidance, inspection, and preparatory committees, because this kind of committee is the biggest scourge in our national work." [5] Lenin also sharply exposed and criticized the harm caused by these committees: "They do not take responsibility for their own affairs, do not submit resolutions to the Council of People's Commissars, do not know that they are responsible for this, but they hide behind the committees. In these committees, it is a mess, and no one can figure out who is responsible; it is a mess, and as a result, a resolution is proposed that everyone is jointly responsible for." [6]
    At the same time, in his report "Five Years of the Russian Revolution and the Prospects of the World Revolution" to the Fourth Congress of the Communist International in November 1922, Lenin again emphasized the reduction of state organs and the implementation of savings in all aspects as much as possible. He said, "But I think we have been able to save a batch of funds to some extent. We will continue to do so in the future. Although this source often comes from the people, we still have to save in every possible way at this moment. We are now studying how to reduce our state budget and reduce the personnel of our state organs. … We must reduce the personnel of our state organs no matter what, and we must save as much as possible. We are implementing savings in all aspects, even in school funding." [7]
    In his article "On Cooperation" in 1923, Lenin proposed:
    "We have two major tasks of the era before us. The first task is to transform our state organs, which were completely inherited from the old era and are simply terrible." [8] In his report "How to Reorganize the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection" to the 12th Congress of the Party, Lenin pointed out that improving state organs is an extremely difficult and very urgent problem. On the one hand, he proposed to the congress to select 75 to 100 new members of the Central Supervisory Committee from workers and peasants. On the other hand, he also proposed that "the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection should be reduced to 300 to 400 staff members." [9] Will the reduction of personnel in state organs affect the quality of work? Is it necessary for the state of the worker-peasant regime? This is what some people are very concerned about or very doubtful about. Lenin answered this question like this: "I am convinced that reducing the staff to the number I said will improve the quality of the work of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection People's Commissariat and the quality of all work many times, and at the same time enable the People's Commissar and the responsible persons to concentrate their efforts on organizing work and systematically and unswervingly improving the quality of work, which is absolutely necessary for the worker-peasant regime and our Soviet system." [10]
    Lenin also advocated combining the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection with the Central Supervisory Committee. He said, "This will benefit both organs."
    [11]
    In the famous paper "Better Fewer, But Better," Lenin put forward such incisive and important opinions on improving state organs: "This rule should be followed: better fewer, but better. This rule should be followed: it is better to wait two years, or even three years, rather than engage in empty busyness without any hope of obtaining capable talents." Lenin particularly clearly pointed out that we should fight for a state organ that spends less money and works accurately: "We should make our state organs as economical as possible. We must completely eliminate all traces of waste in the state organs, and there are still many traces of this kind of waste left in our state organs by Tsarist Russia and its bureaucratic capitalist organs." He also said: "Only by cleaning up our state organs as much as possible and fully reducing all personnel who are not absolutely necessary can we definitely survive."
    [12]
    But this is not saving for the sake of saving, but in order to save non-essential expenses for the most essential construction. This is what Lenin said: "As long as we can maintain the leadership of the working class over the peasantry, we can preserve any savings in our country with extremely strict savings, so as to develop our large-scale machine industry, develop electrification, accelerate the exploitation of peat, complete the construction of the Volkhov Hydropower Station, etc." [13] The resolution of the 12th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on the rural tax policy also decided: "The Communist Party should pay close attention to using all funds obtained from taxation in the most economical way, and especially should pay attention to using them to meet truly necessary needs." [14]
    In the organizational report of the Central Committee to the 12th Party Congress, Stalin further believed, according to Lenin's instructions, that the streamlining of state organs is related to the connection between the peasant economy and the industrial economy, to whether the national economy can persist, and also to political bankruptcy. He said:
    "The question is posed in this way: either we improve economic organizations, reduce their staffing, simplify them, reduce expenditures, and supplement them with personnel close to our party, then we can achieve the goal of implementing the so-called New Economic Policy, that is, industry will manufacture the most finished products in order to supply the countryside and obtain the necessary products, so that we can establish a connection between the peasant economy and the industrial economy, or we cannot do this, and that will be bankruptcy.
    Furthermore, either state organs and tax organs themselves implement streamlining and drive out thieves and swindlers, then we can take less from the peasants than we do now, and the national economy can persist. Or this organ becomes a place where only things go in and nothing comes out, as in the southeast region, everything taken from the peasants is spent on supporting the organ itself, then it will be political bankruptcy." [15]
    The resolution made by the 12th Party Congress pointed out: "The task of establishing streamlined, truly new, and truly socialist organs is the most important task in the next few years. Only by successfully solving it can we guarantee the inseparable alliance between workers and peasants." [16]
    Streamlining and saving are not only necessary for state organs, but also for cooperatives. Because the development and consolidation of cooperatives have a major impact on the restoration of the national economy. In order to run cooperatives well, it is necessary to pay attention to streamlining the cooperative structure, practicing strict economy, and tightening expenditures. Therefore, the resolution of the 13th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1924 on cooperatives decided: "All methods should be used to streamline cooperative structures and reduce cooperative expenditures so that in the struggle with private commerce, goods can be sold to consumers organized by themselves at prices lower than the average market price to encourage those who participate in cooperatives." [17] The resolution of the 14th Conference of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1925 on cooperatives also pointed out: "In order to rectify cooperative work, consolidate the trust of the broad masses of residents in cooperatives, and fight against waste, theft, and irresponsibility in cooperative organs, it is of special significance at present." It also said: "Further reduce (especially grassroots cooperative organizations) miscellaneous expenses, and use one administrator wherever a salaried administrator can be used." [18]
    Lowering the cost of industrial products is a great saving. We know that only by developing state-owned large-scale industry can we lay a solid foundation for the proletarian dictatorship. But in 1924, 70 percent of the total output of consumer goods from Soviet state-owned industries was used to meet the needs of cities, and only 30 percent was used to meet the needs of peasants. In order to lower costs, enable state-owned industrial consumer goods to meet the needs of the vast consumers—peasants and workers—and compete victoriously with private capital, the resolution of the 13th Conference of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1924 on the current tasks of economic policy gave such precise instructions on lowering industrial product prices, carrying out savings in state-owned industries, and streamlining their trade organs:
    "The reason why industrial product prices have reached such a high level in the past year is not only due to objective reasons, but also to a large extent due to the shortcomings in industrial organization and the lack of savings in miscellaneous expenses. In order to restore the republic's economy, this saving is absolutely necessary. The policy of lowering prices should make industry pay attention to reducing costs by further improving and expanding production and minimizing miscellaneous expenses, and pay attention to improving and streamlining its trade organs." Regarding strengthening domestic trade and cooperative work, the resolution pointed out: "The lack of flexibility and dispersion of these organs, the huge and bureaucratic nature of trade organs, high miscellaneous expenses, the inability to open up roads close to the consuming masses, and the inability to fully adapt to and meet the needs of scattered millions of peasants all require the Party to carry out arduous work to correct these shortcomings revealed by the crisis period." [19]
    Saving in trade organs is also necessary. In order to assist and stimulate the development of domestic productive forces, improve the organizational forms of foreign trade, and protect the socialist economy from economic attacks by capitalist countries, it was necessary at that time to maintain the independence and integrity of the monopoly of foreign trade, and it was necessary to establish different trade organizations in foreign trade. But in order to make trade organizations sound and powerful, the plenum of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1925 put forward three guidelines that must be observed when establishing various organizations in the resolution on foreign trade. The second guideline is: "Establish various more flexible and specialized trade organization institutions to make trade institutions lean and simple." [20]
    During the period of economic recovery, the Russian Communist Party used all methods to assist all peasants in further developing agriculture, and paid special attention to the needs of the majority of poor peasants in rural areas. In order to help peasants with weak productivity, the Russian Communist Party also believed that it was necessary to reduce personnel and reduce the expenses of state organs. The plenum of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1925 decided in the resolution on "The Party's Current Tasks in Economic Policy that Come with the Needs of the Rural Economy": "Strictly save state funds, especially the non-productive needs of state organs, in order to increase financial assistance to farm households with weak productivity. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce state expenditures as much as possible and effectively reduce the salary expenditures of state organs (reducing staff, reducing janitors, etc.) to increase agricultural loan funds and help general farm households with weak productivity." [21]
    Strengthening financial discipline and financial supervision also has a major impact on reducing state expenditures. The 12th Party Congress suggested that the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection "abandon the continuous, daily, and formal supervision of all financial affairs of state organs, and investigate the important key points of our economic and management institutions according to pre-planned plans or according to actual requirements." [22] At the end of 1923, the Financial Supervision Bureau of the People's Commissariat of Finance was specially established, taking all measures to eliminate all illegal phenomena in financial expenditures.
    The restoration of the local financial system and the preparation of local budgets also greatly helped reduce state expenditures. On the one hand, this promoted the economic creativity and initiative of local organs, and on the other hand, it shifted part of the state budget expenditures to local budgets, which could reduce the state budget deficit.
    In addition, the Soviet state has also established various reward and punishment systems, regulations, and methods to combat waste and tighten expenditures.
    The Soviet Union, under the capitalist blockade and encirclement, quickly improved its financial situation in a short period of five years under extremely difficult conditions, overcame the budget deficit; and victoriously completed the tasks of the recovery period in agriculture and industry. This achievement is inseparable from Lenin, Stalin, and the Soviet Communist Party's resolute and consistent implementation of the policy of streamlining institutions, practicing strict economy, and tightening expenditures. During the period of economic recovery in our country, streamlining and saving have also become a major task. In 1950, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in the article "Strive for a Fundamental Turn for the Better in the National Financial and Economic Situation" that to obtain a fundamental turn for the better in the financial and economic situation requires three conditions, one of which is a large reduction in the funds required by state organs. Since then, our country has taken various measures to implement streamlining and saving. In particular, the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy launched in the end of 1951 and the first half of 1952 can purify state organs, improve their work efficiency, and save their expenditures. Today, in the period when we have begun to implement the first five-year construction plan, state organs are still somewhat large, expenditures are still not strict enough, and funds are still very difficult. If we do not pay attention, it may affect the state's key construction. Therefore, humbly and conscientiously learning from the Soviet Union's experience in streamlining institutions, practicing strict economy, and tightening expenditures during the period of national economic recovery is of great significance to the national construction we are carrying out.

    学习苏联在恢复国民经济时期中关于精简机构和紧缩开支的经验
    马建民
    苏联在恢复国民经济时期，曾遇到许多严重困难，特别是资金缺乏的困难。列宁在一九二二年九月致第五次全俄职工代表大会的信中曾说：“我们的情况是特别地困难的，因为我们缺乏恢复固定资本，即机器、工具、房屋等等的手段”。〔一〕苏联共产党在列宁、斯大林领导下，为了克服恢复国民经济时期的资金困难，曾想出许多办法，进行许多措施，得到很多经验，而经常注意精简机构和紧缩开支也是其中一个很重要的经验。
    一九二一年俄共（布）第十一次全俄代表会议关于“党在恢复经济方面的当前任务”的决议中，首先指出了紧缩开支的重要意义，认为：“如不坚决紧缩国家预算，就不可能恢复国民经济”。因而决定“苏维埃共和国及其所有中央机关与地方机关的开支，应缩减到最低限度”。决议更明确指出：
  “要发展国家大工业——无产阶级专政之基础——就要求将最大部分的国家物资后备——原料、粮食、燃料、货币——集中于国家之手，并有计划地分配这些物资后备，使能保证依靠国家供给的各企业之生产工作不致间断。应当保证这些企业有粮食与货币基金，以保障各该企业之工人提高其劳动生产率。为了执行这一任务，必须进一步地坚决裁减苏维埃机关”。〔二〕
    为缩减国家开支，全俄中央执行委员会在一九二一年十月十日曾发出指示，号召人民努力开源节流，用一切方法保卫人民国库的利益，并责成一切机关必须严格预算制度：（一）严密地根据生产计划和它们的工作大纲编制财政预算；（二）在规定期内编制和呈交预算，谁不到期呈交预算，应受法庭制裁；（三）不许乱开支和超过开支，违者应受法律责任；（四）严格遵守出纳统一原则；（五）及时把贷款转解地方；（六）严格遵守专用贷款办法等等。
    在新经济政策开始时，由国家供给口粮的人数连军队在内共约三千五百万人，这是造成当时苏维埃财政赤字的重要原因之一。是为国家所不能负担的。为了解决这个问题，俄共（布）第十一次代表大会关于财政政策的决议，强调地指出：“当与预算赤字作斗争时，首先必须清楚意识到，苏维埃国家没有足够的经济后备，特别是财政后备，来供养前一时期留下的，如此庞大的行政机构和经济机构。……苏维埃国家必须于短期内断然‘摆脱此种过重负担’”。又说：“……必须厉行裁减行政机构，缩减中央以及各地方政府机关数目，将一些开支移归地方预算，而凡与直接支持无产阶级国家之存在无关的一切开支，统由国家预算中勾销。”〔三〕
    苏维埃政府采取了许多措施：企业实行经济核算制，小企业出租，设立审查及缩减机关数目及其定员的专门委员会，实行新工资制。结果，一九二二年初靠国家预算供给的，包括还未转入经济核算制的企业工人在内，有六百万人，而一年以后，就只有二百八十万人了。
      列宁更明确指出：要裁减各种不必要的委员会，他说：“因此要注意到，使人民委员会内和劳动国防委员会内的各种委员会加以裁减，使它们知道并解决自己份内的事情，而不是把事情分散到无数的委员会中去。近几天来把各委员会都清洗过。总共有一百二十个各种各样的委员会。有多少个是真正必要的呢？只有十六个。而这还不是第一次清洗。”〔四〕俄共（布）第十二次代表大会的决议也指出：要“与建立各种偶然性的临时委员会如调查、指导、检查、筹备委员会等事作斗争，因为这种委员会乃是我国国家工作中的最大祸害”。〔五〕列宁并尖锐地揭露与批评这些委员会所造成的害处是：“不去对自己的事情负责，不去把决议提交人民委员会，不去知道自己对这负有责任，而他们却躲藏在各委员会后面。在这些委员会里，乱七八糟，谁都弄不清楚是谁负责；一塌糊涂，结果，提出一个由大家共同负责的决议了事。”〔六〕
    同时，列宁在一九二二年十一月共产国际第四次代表大会所作“俄国革命五周年与世界革命底前途”的报告中，又强调提出裁减国家机关并尽量在各方面实行节省。他说：“但我认为，我们已能多少节省一批资财。今后我们也还要这样做去。虽然这种来源往往是出自人民身上，但此刻我们总还得百般节省。现在我们正在研究怎样缩减我们的国家预算，裁减我们国家机关的人员。……我们无论如何，应当缩减我们的国家机关人员，我们必须尽量节省。我们在各方面，甚至在学校经费方面，都实行节省。”〔七〕
    一九二三年列宁在“论合作制”一文中提出：
  “在我们面前有两个划时代的主要任务。第一个任务，就是改造我们那完全从旧时代接受过来，简直是坏透了的国家机关”。〔八〕在向党第十二次代表大会所提“怎样改组工农检查院”的报告中，列宁指出了改善国家机关是一个极端困难与非常迫切的问题。他一方面向代表大会提议，从工人和农民中选出七十五至一百个中央监察委员会的新委员，另方面，又提出“工农检查院应当缩减到三百至四百个职员”。〔九〕国家机关裁减人员，会不会影响到工作的质量？是不是工农政权的国家所必要的？这是有些人很关心或很怀疑的。列宁对这一问题这样解答：“我深信，把职员减少到我所说的这个数目，会使工农检查人民委员部工作人员的质量以及全部工作底质量改善许多倍，同时使该人民委员及各负责人员，能够集中全力去组织工作，去有系统地、一往直前地提高工作质量，这对工农政权和我们苏维埃制度来说，是绝对必要的。”〔十〕
    列宁还主张将工农检查院与中央监察委员会结合起来，他说：“这对于双方机关都会有益处”。
  〔十一〕
    在“宁肯少些，但要好些”这一著名的论文内，列宁对于改善国家机关曾提出这样精辟与重要的意见：“应该遵守这一规则：宁肯数量少，但要质量好。应该遵守这一规则：与其白白空忙，毫无获得精干人材的希望，不如再等两年，甚至三年，倒还是要好一些。”列宁特别明白地指出要为花钱少而工作得准确的国家机构而进行斗争：“我们应当使我们国家机关尽量节省。我们必须把国家机关中所有一切浪费现象的遗迹铲除干净，而沙皇俄罗斯及其官僚资本主义机关所遗留在我们国家机关中的这种遗迹，尚是很多的。”他并说：“只有尽量清洗我们的国家机关，充分裁减其中一切非绝对必需的人事，只有经过这种办法，我们才定能支持下去。”
  〔十二〕
    但这并不是为节省而节省，而是为了将非必需的费用节省下来用之于最必需的建设上。这就是列宁所说的：“我们只要能保持工人阶级对于农民的领导，就能在我们国家里用极严格节省的办法把任何一点贮蓄都保存起来，借以发展我们的大机器工业，发展电气化，加紧开采泥炭，完成瓦尔霍夫水电站建筑工程等等。”〔十三〕俄共（布）第十二次代表大会关于农村税收政策的决议中也曾决定：“共产党应切实注意，要最节省地运用那些由税收得来的一切资金，特别是应注意将其用于满足真正必须的需要”。〔十四〕
    斯大林在第十二次党代表大会中央委员会的组织报告中，根据列宁的指示，进一步认为国家机构的精简与否有关于农民经济与工业经济的联系，有关于国民经济的能否坚持，也有关于政治的破产。他说：
    “问题是这样摆着的，或者我们改善经济组织，缩减它们的定员，简化它们，减少开支，以靠近我党的人员补充他们，那末，我们就能达到实行所谓新经济政策的目的，即是工业将制造出最多的成品以便供给农村和得到必须的产品，这样，我们就能建立起农民经济与工业经济的联系，或者我们办不到这点，那就将是破产。
    再者，或者国家机构，税收机构本身实行精简，赶出其中的盗贼和骗子，那末，我们就能比现在较少地取之于农民，而国民经济就能坚持下去。或者这个机构变为有进无出，像曾在东南地区一样，一切取自于农民的东西，都花费在养活机关本身上，——那末，就将是政治的破产”。〔十五〕
    第十二次党代表大会所作出的决议则指出：“建立精简的、真正新的、真正是社会主义的机构的任务，是今后几年最重要的任务。只有顺利地解决它，才能保证不可分离的工农联盟”。〔十六〕
    精简节约，不仅对于国家机关是必要的，就是合作社也是必要。因为合作社的发展与巩固，对于国民经济的恢复，有重大作用。而要想使合作社办得好，就必须注意合作社机构的精简与厉行节约，紧缩开支。因此，一九二四年俄共（布）第十三次代表大会关于合作社的决议中就决定：“应当用一切方法精简合作社机构，缩减合作社开支，以便在与私人商业斗争中，能以低于市场平均价格的商品售与自己组织起来的消费者，以鼓励那些参加合作社的人们。”〔十七〕一九二五年俄共（布）第十四次代表会议关于合作社的决议中又指出：“为着整顿合作社工作，巩固广大居民群众对合作社的信任，同合作社机关中的浪费、盗窃及无人负责的现象作斗争，在目前具有特殊意义。”又说：“进一步缩减（特别是基层合作社组织）杂费，凡是可以使用一个薪金制管理员的地方，都使用一个管理员。”〔十八〕
    降低工业品的成本，是一个很大的节约。我们知道，只有发展国有大工业，才能奠立无产阶级专政的稳固基础。但在一九二四年时，苏联国营工业的消费品生产总量中有百分之七十用于满足城市的需要，只有百分之三十才用于满足农民的需要。为了降低成本，使国营工业消费品满足广大消费者——农民和工人的需要并胜利地与私人资本进行竞争，一九二四年俄共（布）第十三次代表会议关于经济政策底当前任务的决议，对于降低工业品价格、在国营工业中开展节约并精简其贸易机构等方面曾给予这样确切的指示：
    “工业品价格于过去一年中所以达到如此的高度，不仅有其客观原因，而且在很大程度上，是由于工业组织方面的缺点，以及在杂费开支上缺乏节约之故，为了恢复共和国经济，这种节约是完全必要的。降低价格之政策，应使工业注意用进一步改善与扩大生产，最大限度地缩减杂费开支等方法来减低成本，和注意改进并精简其贸易机构。”对于加强国内贸易与合作社工作，决议又指出：“这些机关的不够灵活与零散，贸易机构的庞大与官僚化，杂费大，不善于开辟接近消费群众的道路，不能充分适应与满足散漫的千百万农民的需要，所有这些情况，都要求党进行顽强的工作，来纠正为危机时期所显明暴露出来的这些缺点。”〔十九〕
    贸易机构的节省也是必要的。为了协助与刺激国内生产力的发展，改进对外贸易的组织形式，保卫社会主义经济使之免受资本主义国家的经济袭击，当时必须保持对外贸易垄断权的独立完整，以及在对外贸易方面必须建立不同的贸易组织。但为了使贸易组织健全有力，在建立各种组织时，一九二五年俄共（布）中央委员会全会在关于对外贸易的决议内提出必须遵守三个方针，其中第二个方针就是：“建立各种更灵活的专门的贸易组织机构，使贸易机构精干而简便。”〔二十〕
    在恢复国民经济时期，俄国共产党曾用一切方法协助全体农民进一步发展农业，对于农村中大部贫农的需要，更曾予以特别的注意。为了帮助生产力薄弱的农民，俄国共产党也认为必须裁减人员与减少国家机关开支。一九二五年俄共（布）中央委员会全会在“随农村经济需要而来的，党在经济政策方面的当前任务”的决议中决定：“严格节约国家资金，特别是国家机关的非生产需要，以便增加对生产力薄弱农户的财政帮助。因此，必须尽量缩减国家开支，切实缩减国家机关的薪水开支（裁减职员，减少勤杂人员等），以增加农贷资金，帮助一般生产力薄弱的农户。”〔二十一〕
    加强财政纪律与财政监督，对于缩减国家开支，也有重大作用。第十二次党代表大会曾建议工农检查院“放弃对国家机关一切钱财业务的不断的日常的形式的监督，而按预定的计划，或依据实际提出的要求，去查究我们经济和管理机构的重要关键之点。”〔二十二〕并于一九二三年末又特别成立了财政人民委员部的财政监督局，采取一切办法消除一切在财政开支上的违法现象。
    地方财政制度的恢复与地方预算的编制，也大大有助于国家开支的缩减，这一方面促进了地方机关经济上的创造性积极性，同时也使国家预算的一部分开支移到地方预算上面去，这样就能减少国家预算的亏空。
    此外，苏维埃国家，为了反对浪费，紧缩开支，还订有各种奖惩制度，条例与办法等等。
    处在资本主义封锁与包围之下的苏联，在极端困难的条件下，经过短短的五年，财政状况就迅速好转，战胜了预算赤字；并在农业和工业上胜利的完成了恢复时期的任务。这种成就是和列宁、斯大林及苏联共产党坚决一贯地贯彻精简机构、厉行节约和紧缩开支的政策是分不开的。我国在恢复国民经济的时期中，精简节约也曾成为一个重大的任务。一九五○年，毛泽东同志在“为争取国家财政经济状况的基本好转而斗争”一文中就曾指出，要获得财政经济情况的根本好转，需要三个条件，其中一个条件就是国家机构所需经费的大量节减。在这以后，我国就已经采取种种措施来实行精简节约，特别是在一九五一年底和一九五二年上半年展开的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动，更能纯洁国家机关，提高其工作效率，节约其开支。今天，在我们已开始实行第一个五年建设计划的时期，国家机构仍有些庞大，开支仍有些不够严格，资金仍有很大困难，如不注意，就可能影响国家重点建设。因此，虚心地认真地学习苏联在国民经济恢复时期精简机构、厉行节约和紧缩开支的经验，对我们正在进行的国家建设是有很大意义的。
