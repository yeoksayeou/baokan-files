Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 17th: According to TASS, the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic held a regular meeting on the 16th. Maurice Erhmann, President of the International Association of Journalists, Louis Pottier, Secretary of the Paris and Suburban Peace Council, and André Poitier, a representative of French workers, were specially invited to attend the meeting. Representatives of residents from West Germany and the German Democratic Republic also participated in the meeting. Diplomatic envoys and embassy staff from various countries stationed in the German Democratic Republic also attended the meeting.

Walter Ulbricht, Acting Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, presented the German Democratic Republic government's statement on the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Meeting.

Ulbricht emphasized that the German Democratic Republic government welcomed the Western powers' agreement with the Soviet government's proposal to hold a Four Foreign Ministers Meeting in Berlin and would do its utmost to ensure the success of this meeting. Ulbricht also exposed the Bonn government's aim to sabotage the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Meeting, thereby hindering the anti-national policy of a peaceful solution to the German question. In outlining this statement, Ulbricht said that the German Democratic Republic government advocates that the Berlin Four Foreign Ministers Meeting should discuss the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany and the issue of restoring German unification on a democratic and peaceful basis. In addition, Ulbricht, in the interests of all the German people, demanded that the Four Powers invite representatives from the German Democratic Republic and West Germany to participate in the discussion of the German question at the Four Foreign Ministers Meeting. Ulbricht said that the German Democratic Republic government, as before, is prepared to hold talks with West German representatives to establish an all-German interim government and prepare for free all-German elections.

The meeting also discussed and passed on first reading the draft law on the 1954 national economic plan proposed by the German Democratic Republic government. Bruno Leuschner, Chairman of the State Planning Commission, explained the bill. The purpose of this bill is to further implement the new policy of the German Democratic Republic government to improve the material living standards of residents and promote the cause of restoring German unification on a democratic and peaceful basis. According to this bill, the total industrial output in 1954 will increase by 12.6 percent compared with 1953. In 1954, the total industrial output of the socialist economic sector in the national economy will increase by 11.8 percent, while the production of private enterprises will potentially increase by 16.8 percent compared with 1953, and the total output of handicraft enterprises will increase by 19.8 percent. Due to the expansion of the production of various products, the increase in production volume, the increase in labor productivity, and the reduction in product costs, the national income of the German Democratic Republic will increase by 16 percent compared with 1953. In 1954, the total foreign trade volume of the German Democratic Republic will increase by 49 percent compared with 1953. The total retail trade volume will increase by 13.2 percent. The turnover of private retail trade will potentially increase by 21 percent compared with 1953. The national economic plan bill also stipulates that agriculture should be further developed and the construction of national social and cultural life should be expanded.

After Leuschner's speech, the meeting held discussions. Representatives of the eight parliamentary groups spoke, and they all unanimously supported the government's proposed draft law on the 1954 national economic plan of the German Democratic Republic.
