    (Xinhua News Agency, December 27th) According to Vietnam News Agency: The communiqué on the 26th stated that in a single day, the Vietnamese People's Army annihilated and routed a total of nine enemy battalions in the northwestern region of Lai Châu.
    On December 19th, the Vietnamese People's Army routed six enemy battalions in the Nam Nhé area, 50 kilometers northwest of Lai Châu provincial capital, killing, wounding, and capturing 250 enemy soldiers. On the same day, the People's Army also annihilated and routed three enemy battalions on a high ground 40 kilometers northwest of Lai Châu provincial capital, and seized a large number of weapons and ammunition. The remaining enemies fled in panic into the jungle, and the Vietnamese People's Army is pursuing them.
   (Xinhua News Agency, December 27th) According to Vietnam News Agency on the 26th: On December 18th, the Vietnamese People's Army sank and severely damaged three enemy gunboats in the Thái Bình River in Kiến An Province, North Vietnam, eliminating seventy enemy soldiers of European and African origin.
    In addition, on December 3rd, the People's Army sank a French gunboat in Long Châu Sa Province, South Vietnam.
   (Xinhua News Agency, December 27th) According to Vietnam News Agency: At the request of the Vietnamese Committee for the Defense of World Peace, and in response to the resolution of the Third World Trade Union Congress regarding "International Day of Active Support for the Vietnamese People and Struggle to Stop the Colonial War in Vietnam," the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam released 297 French, African, and Foreign Legion prisoners of war on "Christmas" (December 25th). These released prisoners of war issued an appeal to the officers, non-commissioned officers, and soldiers of the French Expeditionary Force, demanding an end to the criminal war of aggression against Vietnam.
    The appeal stated: The lenient measures taken by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam towards us are a manifestation of the policy of a strong nation. One thing you should know is that Vietnam's release of prisoners of war is not for propaganda, but to confirm its desire for peace.
    The appeal emphasized: The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which released prisoners of war while the war was still going on, awakened those deceived by the invaders' deceptive propaganda with convincing facts. We realize that this war of aggression is unjust and criminal; we are forced to serve as cannon fodder to safeguard interests that do not belong to the French people. We ask you to beware of the colonizers' deceptive propaganda.
    The appeal concluded by calling on the French Expeditionary Force to unite, demand the immediate repatriation of the French Expeditionary Force, and demand that the Vietnam problem be resolved through peace negotiations with the Vietnamese government headed by President Ho Chi Minh.

    越南人民军在莱州西北击溃敌军九个连
    越南政府最近释放近三百名法军战俘
     【新华社二十七日讯】据越南通讯社讯：二十六日的公报说，越南人民军在一天之内，在莱州西北地区歼灭和击溃敌军共九个连。
    十二月十九日，越南人民军在莱州省会西北五十公里的南椰地区击溃敌军六个连，毙、伤、俘敌军二百五十名；在同一天，人民军又在莱州省会西北四十公里的某高地歼灭和击溃敌人三个连，并缴获大批武器、弹药。残敌仓皇向丛林中逃窜，越南人民军正跟踪追击中。
   【新华社二十七日讯】据越南通讯社二十六日讯：越南人民军十八日在北越建安省的太平河击沉和重创敌军汽艇三艘，计歼灭欧非籍的敌军七十名。
    另外，人民军十二月三日在南越龙朱沙省击沉法军炮艇一艘。
   【新华社二十七日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南民主共和国政府应越南保卫世界和平委员会的要求，并响应世界工会第三次代表大会关于“国际积极支援越南人民日与争取停止越南殖民战争斗争日”的决议，在“圣诞节”（十二月二十五日）释放了二百九十七名法国籍、非洲籍和外籍军团的战俘。这些被释放的战俘发表了致法国远征军军官、军士和士兵的呼吁书，要求停止侵略越南的罪恶战争。
    呼吁书说：越南民主共和国政府对我们采取的宽大措施，是一个强大国家的政策的体现。有一件事是你们应该知道的，就是，越南释放战俘不是为了宣传，而是为了证实它的和平愿望。
    呼吁书强调说：当战争还在进行时就释放战俘的越南民主共和国政府，用令人信服的事实唤醒了受侵略者欺骗宣传的人们。我们认识到这场侵略战争是非正义的和罪恶的；我们被迫充当炮灰来维护的并不是属于法国人民的利益。我们要求你们提防殖民者的骗人的宣传。
    呼吁书最后号召法国远征军团结起来，要求立即遣返法国远征军，并要求通过和以胡志明主席为首的越南政府进行和平谈判的方法来解决越南问题。
