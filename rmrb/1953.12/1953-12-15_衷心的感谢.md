    Heartfelt Thanks
    By Zhang Zhenfa, Director of Gao Kan Agricultural Production Cooperative
    This year, our agricultural production cooperative has achieved a bumper harvest, with each work day yielding a net of forty catties of grain. The cooperative members all know that this is thanks to the good leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, who led us onto the path of cooperatives. After studying the general line for the transition period, our hearts are even brighter, and we understand another truth—agricultural development cannot be separated from industry. If we want to increase production and improve our lives, we need the help of the working class.
    To put it simply, after harvesting wheat this year, the cooperative members all wanted to plant another crop of autumn Chinese cabbage, but they were worried that turning the soil would be too much work. Moreover, this year the rainfall was frequent, and the work in the fields was tight, leaving no time to spare. Just as we were struggling with this, the technical guidance station sent over two tractors. Previously, the cooperative members had only seen tractors in movies, and no one thought that we would be able to use tractors ourselves so quickly. The two tractors plowed one hundred mu (each mu is one thousand square meters) of wheat fields and twenty-five mu of potato fields in three days. We planted Chinese cabbage and radishes, and harvested 470,000 catties of autumn vegetables, which were all sold to government offices and factories in Shenyang.
    Before the autumn harvest, the technical guidance station sent potato diggers and corn threshers. Once the potato digger went through the field, the potatoes came to the surface. It only took thirty-four workers to harvest all fifty-six mu of land. If we had used shovels as in the past, it would have taken thirteen times the labor. The corn thresher also saved us five times the manpower. What quenched our thirst the most was the No. 1100 thresher. From a distance, it looked like a large truck with a shed, covered with gears. As soon as the motor started, the thresher started to spin. For example, when threshing sorghum, you just put the ears into its mouth, and it would use its teeth to bite, its rollers to rub, and then it would sift and winnow. The chaff was blown out from the back, and the good grain came out from underneath. It took only one and a half days to thresh one hundred and twenty-seven mu of sorghum. If we had used stone rollers, it would have taken eighty-eight workers and sixty-six horses. In total, from the wheat harvest to now, we have saved two thousand seven hundred and eighty man-days and horse-days. If it weren't for the help of the working-class elder brothers, how could we have had time to plant autumn vegetables, haul manure, and engage in sideline production! Next year, the technical guidance station will also use twenty-four-row planters to help us plant the land.
    The working-class elder brothers not only build machines for us, but they also consider everything for us in every way. The Shenyang Farm Implement Factory also sent representatives to hold座谈会 with us, specifically to solicit our opinions on farm implements. We raised two opinions with them: one was that the plowshare of the shovel plow was too few, and when it broke, there was nothing to use. We suggested that each shovel plow should have two more plowshares. The second opinion was that the depth adjustment lever of the planter had notches that were too far apart, and the depth varied too much. We suggested adding more notches. When we saw the machines later, they had all been modified according to our opinions.
    Another benefit of industrial development is that things are good and prices are low. In 1949 (the second year after the liberation of Shenyang), kerosene was like yellow soup, and it produced black smoke as soon as it was lit, and it cost 7,000 yuan (converted to RMB) per catty; now, the oil is clear and bright, and there is no smoke, and it only costs 3,600 yuan per catty. A Red Flag brand large cart rubber band cost 3.7 million yuan in 1951, and this year it is 2.97 million yuan. In 1951, the average price of various white fine cloths was 2,980 yuan per foot, and this year the average is 2,806 yuan. With lower prices and higher grain prices, we can exchange for more things. In the past, it was rare for peasant families to have a piece of glass the size of glasses on their windows, but now every household has large glass windows. In the past, peasants couldn't wear a new set of clothes in their entire lives, but now everyone has three sets of single clothes and two sets of cotton clothes. In the future, when the country is industrialized and more machines are made, agricultural production will be able to develop even more.
    I have visited the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in Beijing, and the machine factories, farm implement factories, and textile factories in Shenyang... On one side, it is still a pile of scrap iron, and on the other side, it becomes steel plates, steel bars, and various machines. On one side, it is still a pile of tangled wool, and on the other side, it becomes thread, which is woven into blankets. These things seem very simple, but they are not easy to do. When workers go to work, they can't be late even for a minute. For example, if the person in charge of the electrical power is late, all the machines in the factory will not be able to move. It's not like us peasants, where being a little early or a little late doesn't cause any big problems. Workers can't do anything if their eyesight is poor or their hearing is impaired. Workers can't succeed with just strength, without culture and technology. Every worker has to spend a lot of time learning technology. In the steel mills, the workers are constantly roasted by the red-hot molten iron. I can't stand it when I'm several steps away, but what about the workers? They work like this every day, winter and summer, all year round. Some people say that workers' lives are much higher than farmers' lives, but that is not true. Not to mention how much the workers contribute to the country, and how hard they work to help us farmers, just taking the workers' lives into account, their lives are not too high. Workers have to pay rent for their houses, pay for water, and spend money to eat a small scallion, and even have to pay for some loess. How can we compare to the peasants, who have their own houses, water wells, and vegetable gardens? If we want to eat something, we can dig it up from our own land. When we go out to visit relatives, we can even ride our own carts. Not to mention these things, just talking about income, our lives are much higher than they used to be. As long as we peasants work hard, our lives will be even better. Moreover, the working-class elder brothers have no selfish interests, have a long-term vision, and are generous, wholeheartedly dedicated to the country's construction. I support the leadership of the working class with both hands, and I want to learn their selflessness, and I am determined to increase agricultural production, support the cities, and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.
      How can we support them? Our cooperative is close to the city, and we will grow more vegetables next year. This year we have grown 30% more vegetables than last year, and our city will definitely develop more next year, and there will definitely be more vegetables to eat than this year. We have already made a plan for this winter. Our cooperative has already hauled bricks, and next year we will dig two more wells and install liberation-style waterwheels, one for watering vegetables and one for watering grapes.
    The state calls for planting fine grains, but we have never grown wheat here. Last year, the technical guidance station taught us to plant more than 30 mu of wheat, and we achieved immediate success. This year we planted 100 mu of wheat and harvested more than 34,000 catties. After keeping the seeds for next year and the wheat for the cooperative members, we turned in the remaining 19,800 catties of wheat as public grain. According to the regulations, we should have turned in 4,500 catties of wheat in the summer tax, but when the cooperative members thought of the country's needs and the good quality of this year's wheat, they turned in all the extra wheat as public grain, and the extra amount was considered an advance payment for the autumn tax. Next year we will have to double the amount and plant 200 mu of wheat. We are now preparing the land, and in the winter, the cooperative's carts go to the city every day to haul manure, all the way until the Spring Festival, and next year we will definitely be able to harvest more wheat and supply more to the city.
    After studying the general line, we see more clearly. To support the cities and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, we must oppose capitalist ideas. Now that the state wants to buy grain, some cooperative members can't understand it and want to wait for the grain price to rise before selling it; there are also one or two families who want to sell it to private merchants and want to use the grain to extend credit. To be honest, these are all rich peasant ideas, and we are determined to break away from these ideas. Our cooperative held three meetings in a row, repeatedly discussing the general line and the socialist road. Now, everyone's thinking is clear, and the entire cooperative can sell 180,000 catties of grain to the state. These kinds of things will inevitably happen in the future. In the future, no matter what happens, we must move forward according to the country's general line, and under the leadership of the working class, we will go all the way to a socialist society.

    衷心的感谢
    高坎农业生产合作社主任　张振发讲
    今年咱们的农业生产合作社得到了丰收，每一个劳动日净得四十斤粮。社员们都知道，这是共产党和毛主席领导得好，引我们走上了合作社的道路。我们学习了国家过渡时期的总路线，心里更敞亮了，又明白了一条道理—农业的发展，离不开工业。我们要想提高生产，改善生活，就得有工人阶级的帮助。
    远的不说，今年割了小麦，社员们都想再种一槎秋白菜，就是发愁翻地太费工夫；偏赶的今年雨水又勤，地里活紧，腾不出手来。正在作难的时候，技术指导站开来了两台拖拉机。以前，社员们光是在电影上看见过拖拉机，谁也没想到这么快咱们自己就能使上拖拉机。两台拖拉机三天就翻完了一百亩
  （每亩一千平方公尺）麦地，和二十五亩土豆（马铃薯）地。我们种上了白菜、萝卜，收了四十七万斤秋菜，都卖给了沈阳的机关和工厂。
    秋收以前，技术指导站又开来了刨土豆和打玉米的机器。土豆机打地里一过，土豆就到浮面上来了。五十六亩地，只用了三十四个人工就全部收完了。要是像过去用铁锹刨，就得多费十三倍的人工。打玉米机也给我们节省了五倍的人力。顶解渴的还是一千一百号的脱谷机。远看像个带棚的大汽车，满身净是牙轮，马达一响，脱谷机就转动起来了。比方打高粱，只要把穗子往嘴里一填，它就自己用牙咬，用磙子搓，又是筛，又是簸，乱柴从屁股后面扬出去，好粮食从肚子底下漏出来。一天半就打完了一百二十七亩地的高粱。要是用石头磙子打场，得用八十八个人工和六十六个马工。这么总算下来，从麦收到现在，一共节省了两千七百八十个人工和马工。要不是工人老大哥的帮助，那能腾出手来种秋菜、拉粪、搞副业生产呢！明年，技术指导站还要用二十四行的播种机来帮咱们种地哩。
    工人老大哥不光是给咱们造机器，还处处为咱们打算得周周到到。沈阳农具工厂还派代表来和咱们开座谈会，专门征求咱们对农具的意见。咱们给他们提过两条意见：一条是铲?机铧子少，坏了就没有使的，我们提议一台铲?机多带两个铧子。第二条意见是播种机的深浅调节器的缺口离的太远，深浅程度相差太多，咱们提议多刻几道缺口。以后再看机器，他们都照我们的意见改过来了。
    工业发展了，再一个好处是东西好，价钱低。一九四九年（沈阳解放的第二年）的煤油就像黄汤子，一点就冒黑烟，还得七千元（折合人民币）一斤；现在的油，清清亮亮，一点烟子也没有，只三千六百元一斤。一条红旗牌的大车胶皮带，一九五一年是三百七十万元，今年是二百九十七万元。一九五一年各种白细布平均每尺二千九百八十元，今年平均是二千八百零六元。物价低了，再加上粮价高，换回来的东西就多。以前咱们庄稼人家里的窗户上镶块眼镜大的玻璃就很新奇，现在家家户户都是大玻璃窗户。以前庄稼人一辈子也穿不上一套新衣服，现在，谁都有三套单衣，两套棉衣。将来国家工业化了，造的机器更多，农业生产就能更加发展。
    我参观过北京的石景山钢铁厂、沈阳的机器厂、农具厂、纺织厂……。这边还是一堆废铁，到那边就成了钢板、钢条、各种机器。这边还是一堆乱羊毛，到那边就成了线子，织成了毛毯。这些看起来好像很简单，做起来可不容易。工人们上班，连一分钟也不能晚。比方一个管电门的，要是你一个人晚了，全厂的机器都不能动弹。不像咱们庄稼人，早一会晚一会出不了什么大问题。工人干起活来，眼力差一点也不行，耳朵聋一点也不行。工人光有力气，没有文化和技术也不成，每个工人都得要花很长时间学技术，在炼钢厂里，工人们成天价叫通红的铁水烤着，我离开好几步远，还烤得受不了，工人们呢？天天这么烤着干活，无冬无夏，一年到头这样。有人说工人生活比农民生活高得太多，这可不是事实。不说工人对国家贡献有多么大，对咱们农民怎样尽心儿帮助，就拿工人的生活来说，工人的生活也不算太高。工人住房子要出房租，吃水要拿水钱，吃棵小葱也得花钱，用点黄土还得花钱。哪像咱们庄稼人，自己有房子，有水井，有菜园子，想吃点什么菜，就到自己地里去挖，出门走亲戚还能坐上自己的车。不说这些事，单说收入，咱们的生活也比过去高得太多了。咱们
  一个庄稼人，只要好好干，咱们的生活还会更好。再说工人老大哥没有私心，眼光远，度量大，一心
  一意为国家的建设。我双手拥护工人阶级的领导，要学习他们的大公无私，决心提高农业生产，支援城市，巩固工农联盟。
      怎么支援法呢？咱们的合作社靠近城市，明年还要多种些菜。今年比去年多种了百分之三十的菜，明年咱们的城市还要发展，吃的菜也一定比今年多。咱们今年冬天就订出计划来了。咱们的社，已经拉好了砖，明年再打两眼井，安上解放式水车，一眼浇菜，一眼浇葡萄。
    国家号召种细粮，可是咱们这里从来没有种过小麦。去年技术指导站教给咱们种了三十多亩地的小麦，头一炮就打响了。今年咱们种了一百亩地的小麦，收了三万四千多斤。留下明年的籽种，留下社员用的，咱们把剩下的一万九千八百多斤小麦，都交了公粮。按规定，夏征小麦我们应交四千五百斤，社员们一想到国家需要，今年的小麦质量又好，就把多余的小麦全交了公粮，多余的数目，算是提前交了秋后的公粮。明年咱们还得增加一倍，种二百亩地的小麦。现在就把地准备好了，冬季，社里的大车天天进城拉粪，一直拉到过春节，明年一定能多收小麦，更多供给城市。
    学习了总路线以后，咱们看得更清楚了。要支援城市，要巩固工农联盟，就要反对资本主义思想。现在国家要买粮食，有的社员想不通，想等着粮价涨了再卖；也有一两家想卖给私商，想拿粮放账。照实说，这都是富农思想，咱们坚决地要同这种思想分家。我们社里一连开了三次会，反来覆去地讲总路线，讲社会主义的道路。现在，大家的思想也通了，全社能卖十八万斤粮食给国家。像这类的事，将来还免不了。以后不论什么事，都要照着国家的总路线往前走，在工人阶级领导下面，一直走到社会主义的社会去。　（本报记者方青记）（附图片）
