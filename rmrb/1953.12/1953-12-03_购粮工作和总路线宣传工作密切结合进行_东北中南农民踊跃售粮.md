    Grain Purchasing Work Closely Integrated with General Line Propaganda Work
    Farmers in Northeast and Central South China Actively Sell Grain
    [Our Newspaper] After the Communist Party Committees and government departments at all levels in the Northeast region vigorously launched propaganda and education on the general line of the state's transition period to farmers, in conjunction with the grain purchasing work, farmers in various places actively sold surplus grain to the state to support national economic construction.
    Agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, agricultural labor models, rural cadres, Communist Party members, and Communist Youth League members in Northeast China have all taken selling surplus grain to the state as a practical action to support the state's general line for the transition period. They have taken the lead in selling large quantities of grain. For example, the Gao Kan, Xinglong, and Bajiazi agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs of Shenyang City decided to sell all 810,000 catties of surplus grain to the state. All members wrote a letter to Chairman Mao reporting their grain selling plan and expressed their desire to work harder to make their cooperatives better. The Xinsheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhongshibao Village, Huinan County, Liaodong Province, harvested a total of 400 shi of rice this year and plans to sell 250 shi to the state. Fei Lianfa, a Communist Party member in Zhujia Village, Shuangliao County, Liaoxi Province, is the leader of a mutual aid team. He mobilized all 14 households in the team to sell all of their surplus grain. Wang Sihui, a model military family member and people's representative in Daxitun Village, Jiaohe County, Jilin Province, sold all 2,500 catties of surplus grain, which motivated farmers throughout the village to actively sell grain. Among them, only 14 households sold 8,630 catties more than originally planned. Farmers in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region, Jilin Province, actively sold grain to the state, and farmers throughout the region have sold 5,099 tons of grain to the state. After being educated on the state's general line for the transition period, the farmers in Sidaizi Village, Fengcheng County, Liaodong Province, sold 18,000 catties of surplus grain in five days by 121 households, which is three or four times more than the total amount of grain sold to the state by the entire village in 1951 and 1952. From 1949 to 1952, Mu Changli, a farmer in Kuandian County, accumulated more than 10,000 catties of surplus grain, waiting to sell it at a high price. After receiving education on the state's general line this time, he sold all of the more than 10,000 catties of accumulated grain to the state.
    Due to the enthusiastic sale of surplus grain by farmers, the amount of grain purchased by state-owned grain departments and cooperatives in the Northeast region has been continuously increasing since the second half of October. The amount of grain purchased in the whole region in October increased by 9.2 percent compared with the same period last year. The amount purchased in late October accounted for more than half of the total amount purchased in the whole month. The amount purchased in early November increased by 63 percent compared with late October. The daily purchase volume in the first five days of mid-November increased by 31.5 percent compared with the daily purchase volume in early November. The last five days increased by 57.8 percent compared with the first five days, and the purchase volume in late November increased again.
    Xinhua News Agency: In the Central South region, the work of purchasing grain is combined with vigorously promoting the general line to farmers. After receiving political education, farmers' enthusiasm for selling surplus grain to support industrial construction is high.
    Since November, the provinces of Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangdong have successively held provincial-level cadre meetings, followed by joint cadre meetings at the county, district, and township levels. These meetings have all thoroughly discussed strengthening the work of state grain purchasing. In order to do a good job in publicizing the general line to farmers and completing the grain purchasing work, the Central South region and party and government organs in various provinces have transferred a large number of cadres to the countryside to strengthen leadership at the grassroots level. The Central South region-level organs alone have transferred more than 1,100 cadres to work in the countryside. The cultural and propaganda departments of local people's governments have also been mobilized. People's cultural centers in Yingcheng, Xiaogan, and Puqi counties in Hubei have all held exhibitions of pictures and objects. In Guidong County, Hunan, nearly 300 propagandists are publicizing the socialist prospects and the significance of grain purchasing to district and township cadres and the broad masses of farmers.
    When studying the general line, the vast number of district and township cadres recognized the beautiful prospects of socialism and felt enlightened; they used the methods of recollection, comparison, and detailed accounting to recognize the benefits of land reform, the assistance of the people's government, and national industrialization for farmers. Taking Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, as an example, since the third quarter of 1952, the farmers in the county have received 11 kinds of loans from the people's government, such as seeds, medicines, agricultural implements, and sideline occupations, totaling one-third of the agricultural tax paid by farmers in the county to the state. At present, in areas where county, district, and township cadre meetings have been held, the work of publicizing the general line to farmers and educating farmers to sell surplus grain has been widely carried out. Farmers participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations have shown great enthusiasm in selling grain. The chairmen or vice-chairmen of 16 agricultural production cooperatives in Chenggao County, Henan Province, reported their plans to sell surplus grain to Chairman Mao. After selling more than 1,300 catties of surplus grain, Jiang Yilin, a member of the "Jian Yi" agricultural production cooperative in the Fourth District of Xinxiang, mobilized 17 households to sell more than 5,700 catties of surplus grain.
    While carrying out large-scale rural political work, economic work has also been strengthened in various parts of the Central South region. The financial and economic departments of the Central South region and Hubei Province have established material supply offices to organize the supply of materials to rural areas. State-owned commercial and supply and marketing cooperatives in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces transported 1.4 to 1.5 million tons of materials to the countryside in November and plan to transport them in December. The supply and marketing cooperative of Henan Province has ordered a large number of agricultural implements from both inside and outside the province. The financial and economic departments of Guangxi Province recently held industrial product exhibitions in 15 key areas in major grain-producing areas, vigorously carrying out rural supply work.

    购粮工作和总路线宣传工作密切结合进行
    东北中南农民踊跃售粮
    【本报讯】东北区各级中共党委和政府部门，配合购粮工作，大张旗鼓地向农民展开国家过渡时期总路线的宣传教育以后，各地农民踊跃把余粮卖给国家，支援国家经济建设。
    东北各地的农业生产合作社、互助组和农业劳动模范、农村干部、共产党员、青年团员，都把出售余粮给国家作为拥护国家过渡时期总路线的实际行动，他们积极带头出卖大宗粮食。如沈阳市郊的高坎、兴隆、八家子这三个农业生产合作社决定把八十一万斤余粮全部卖给国家，全体社员并写信向毛主席报告了他们卖粮的计划，还表示要加倍努力，把他们的合作社办得更好。辽东省辉南县中史堡村新胜农业生产合作社今年共收稻谷四百石，计划卖给国家二百五十石。辽西省双辽县朱家村共产党员费连发是互助组长，他动员全组十四户农民出售了全部余粮。吉林省蛟河县大西屯村模范军属、人民代表王思惠把二千五百斤余粮全部卖出以后，带动了全村农民踊跃售粮。其中仅十四户就比原计划卖粮数量多出八千六百三十斤。吉林省延边朝鲜族自治区农民，踊跃把粮食卖给国家，全区农民已卖给国家的粮食达五千零九十九吨。辽东省凤城县四台子村的农民，受到国家过渡时期总路线的宣传教育以后，五天内有一百二十一户出售余粮一万八千斤，比一九五一年、一九五二年全村卖给国家的粮食都多三、四倍。宽甸县农民穆长礼从
  一九四九年到一九五二年的四年中，积存余粮一万多斤，等待高价出售。这次他在受了国家总路线的教育后，就把积存的一万多斤粮食全部卖给国家。
    由于农民踊跃出售余粮，东北区国营粮食部门和合作社收购粮食的数量，从十月下半月以来不断增加。十月份全区收购粮食的数量比去年同期增加百分之九点二，十月下旬收购数量占全月收购总量的一半以上。十一月上旬收购数量比十月下旬增加百分之六十三，中旬前五日每日收购量比上旬每日收购量增加百分之三十一点五，后五日又比前五日增加百分之五十七点八，下旬收购量又有增加。
    据新华社讯：中南区收购粮食工作和向农民大张旗鼓地宣传总路线结合进行，农民受了政治教育后出售余粮支援工业建设的热情高涨。
    十一月份以来，河南、湖北、湖南、江西、广东等省相继召开省一级的干部会议后，又连续召开县、区、乡三级联合的干部会议。这些会议都曾深入讨论了加强国家收购粮食的工作。为了做好向农民宣传总路线，完成购粮工作，中南区和各省党和政府机关都抽调大批干部下乡，深入基层加强领导。仅中南区一级机关就抽调了一千一百多个干部下乡工作。各地人民政府的文教宣传部门也已动员起来。湖北应城、孝感、蒲圻等县人民文化馆都举办了图片实物展览会。湖南桂东县有近三百名宣传员，向区乡干部和广大农民宣传社会主义前途和收购粮食的意义。
    广大区乡干部在学习总路线时，认识了社会主义的美好前途，都感到心明眼亮；他们用回忆、对比、算细账的办法，认识到土地改革、人民政府的扶助和国家工业化对农民的好处。以湖北省孝感县为例，该县农民自一九五二年第三季度到现在，曾受到人民政府发放的种籽、药械、副业等十一种贷款，总数等于全县农民向国家缴纳农业税额的十分之三。目前，开完县、区、乡干部会议的地区，向农民宣传总路线，教育农民出售余粮的工作已广泛展开。农村中参加互助合作组织的农民，在售粮中表现了极大的热情。河南省成皋县十六个农业生产合作社的社长或副社长向毛主席报告了出售余粮的计划。新乡四区“建一”农业生产合作社社员姜艺林出售余粮一千三百多斤后，又动员十七户农民出售余粮五千七百多斤。
    中南区各地和展开大规模农村政治工作的同时，经济工作也加强了。中南区和湖北等省财经部门都成立了物资供应办公室，组织农村物资供应工作。湖南、江西两省国营商业和供销合作社在十一月份调运下乡和十二月计划调运下乡的物资，有一百四、五十万吨。河南省供销合作社在省内外订购了大批农具。广西省财经部门最近在主要产粮区的十五个重点地区举行了工业品展览会，大力开展农村供应工作。
