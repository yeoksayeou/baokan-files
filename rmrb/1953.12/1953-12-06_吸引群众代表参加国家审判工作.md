    Attracting Mass Representatives to Participate in National Adjudication Work
    You Er
    The participation of people's assessors in the trial of cases is an important way to attract people to participate in national management activities and a significant measure to further expand the democratic foundation of the people's courts. In the past, people's courts in various regions and people's tribunals in various social reform movements invited assessors to participate in the handling of cases and gained some preliminary experience, laying the foundation for the implementation of the people's assessor system. The Second National Judicial Conference, convened in April of this year, summarized the experience of the people's judicial work over the past three years and decided to gradually establish a first-instance assessor system universally. There are two forms of assessment: one is to elect a number of fixed assessors by region, who will attend and assess cases when circuit courts and grassroots courts go to the local area to hear cases or try local cases; the other is to select assessors from relevant mass organizations to participate in trials based on the nature of the case. People's assessors have the same rights as judges in participating in case trials. The implementation of this system can advance the work of the people's courts.
    The superiority of the people's assessor system lies first in its wide absorption of the masses of the people to directly participate in the country's adjudication activities, enhancing the masses' sense of responsibility and ownership of the country. Over the past four years, after various social reform movements, the awareness of the people across the country has generally increased, creating favorable conditions for the implementation of the assessor system. The masses attach great importance to electing their representatives to participate in adjudication activities, believing that this is to send representatives to participate in the work of controlling the "knife handle," and therefore are very cautious and serious in the election. When Jitaixiang Township in Minqing County, Fujian Province, was deliberating on candidates for assessors, some people suggested that Pan Xingban, the director of the township's mediation committee, be a candidate because of his upright style and active work; but after everyone's evaluation, it was believed that he was a "Mr. Nice Guy," who would not speak up when there was reason, nor would he speak up when there was no reason, and could not represent everyone in controlling the power of adjudication. Finally, the whole township elected Xu Zuchang and another person as assessors. The number of people participating in this election accounted for 75 percent of the total number of eligible voters. The assessors are carefully elected by the masses, so in participating in the trial of cases, they can take a sense of ownership, not only on the case, but also on how to judge, actively put forward their own views, so that the judgment is fair and well-founded, and protect the rights and interests of the people. When the People's Court of Gaolan County, Gansu Province, handled the property dispute in the divorce case of poor peasant Wei Yongfu, the assessor sent by the local women's federation pointed out the error of the judge, based on the spirit of the Marriage Law, and protected the interests of women. At the same time, the participation of assessors in the trial process can further enhance the enthusiasm and responsibility of the masses in assisting adjudication work. During the general election in Shenyang, when the people's court handled litigation cases related to the election, the masses saw that their elected representatives—assessors—were participating in the trial, felt more close to the court, actively reflected the situation, and some even automatically wrote written materials and handed them to the assessors to bring back to the court, which strengthened the relationship between the court and the masses.
    Secondly, the assessors are familiar with local conditions, which helps to handle cases correctly. As the saying goes, "A thief can't hide from his neighbors, and eating secretly can't hide from his teeth." Assessors' participation in the trial makes it easier to find out the truth of the case. During the general election in the eighth district of Chengde County, Rehe, when the people's court handled the case of whether landlord Liu Zhenju should be deprived of his right to vote, Liu cunningly said, "Although I am a landlord, I participated in labor before the land reform, and I have not committed any illegal acts after the land reform, so I should have the right to vote." The assessor on the spot pointed out that he rarely worked before the land reform, and after the land reform, he was not honest, wooed cadres, and stole public grain, causing him to bow his head and confess his guilt. During the general election in Yingde County, Guangdong Province, when the people's court handled cases related to voter qualifications, the assessor provided correct and comprehensive materials on the controlled and un-controlled elements in the area, and collected materials on those who should not be controlled but were controlled, so that the court did not allow a single reactionary element to illegally steal the solemn political rights, nor did it erroneously deprive a citizen of their solemn political rights. After the implementation of the assessor system in the People's Court of Xi'an, the masses said, "The comrades of the court are familiar with the policies, and we—the assessors—are familiar with the situation. When the two sides come together, the case will be handled well." In addition, some cases involving specialized technical issues can be handled quickly and correctly with the participation of assessors selected by relevant mass organizations. When the People's Court of Hegang City, Songjiang Province, handled the case of Liu Chun, Dong Guixin, and others destroying the air compressor and mercury lamp charging roller in the mine pit, the workers who were invited to participate in the assessment revealed that destroying the air compressor could cause a gas explosion in the mine pit, and hundreds of workers would be in danger of their lives, and destroying the mercury lamp charging roller would cause the entire factory to stop production. This enabled the court to recognize the seriousness of these incidents and to deal with them correctly.
    Thirdly, the participation of assessors in the trial of cases can also play a role in publicizing and educating people about the law. People's assessors are elected by the masses or selected by mass organizations and have close ties with the masses. In the process of participating in the trial, they can bring the situation of the case and the opinions of the masses to the court on the one hand, and bring the results of the handling and the government's policies and decrees to the masses on the other hand. When Yixian County, Liaoxi Province, tried the case of physician Sun Baorui causing abortion for women, the local women's federation and medical workers selected assessors to participate in the trial of the case, which not only enabled the case to be handled correctly, but also, after the judgment, they returned to their units to carry out publicity and organized seminars, which had the effect of preventing crime. In the six months before the trial of the case, four abortion cases occurred in Yixian County; in the six months after the case was handled, there was not a single case.
    At present, many regions have combined the work of the people's court in the general election to carry out and establish the work of people's assessment. The following three methods are generally adopted: (1) Assessors are elected at the same time as the personnel of the voter qualification review group are produced, so that they can participate in the assessment first when the people's court hears cases such as voter qualification disputes, and then they will be transferred to formal assessors after a period of testing; (2) The voter group or village cadres nominate, and after mass deliberation and court research, the assessors are elected at the voter congress at the same time as the representatives; (3) In order to avoid confusion between the election of assessors and the election of representatives in some areas, the people's assessors are not elected at the voter congress at the same time as the representatives, but are elected at the township people's congress. In addition, some areas elect assessors or cultivate assessor candidates by establishing circuit courts and combining them with clearing backlog cases. These practices are all feasible. However, some areas still lack a clear understanding of the assessor system and ignore the establishment of the assessor system; other areas, although the assessor system has been established, do not have a sufficient understanding of the great significance of implementing assessment, and there is formalism "assessment" and the use of views, turning assessment into "hearing". When trying cases, they neither explain the case nor solicit the opinions of the assessors, making the assessment a formality and nominal. These situations must be corrected in future work.

    吸引群众代表参加国家审判工作
    有耳
    人民陪审员参加诉讼案件的审理，是吸引人民参与国家管理活动的一种重要形式，是更加扩大人民法院民主基础的一项重要措施。过去各地人民法院及各项社会改革运动中的人民法庭，在处理案件时，曾邀请过陪审员参加，并取得一些初步经验，给实行人民陪审制打下了基础。今年四月间召开的第二届全国司法会议，总结了三年来人民司法工作的经验，决定逐步地普遍建立一审陪审制。陪审形式有两种：一种是按地区选出若干固定陪审员，在巡回法庭和基层法院到当地就审或审理当地案件时，即出席陪审；另一种是就案件性质，分别由有关的群众团体选派陪审员参加审判。人民陪审员在参加案件审判中和审判员有同等权利。这一制度的实行，可以使人民法院的工作向前推进一步。
    人民陪审制的优越性，首先在于它广泛地吸收人民群众直接参与国家的审判活动，提高群众对国家的责任心和主人翁感觉。四年多来全国人民经过各项社会改革运动后，觉悟普遍提高，给实行陪审制，创造了有利条件。群众对于选举自己的代表参加审判活动，极为重视，认为这是选派代表去参加掌握“刀把子”的工作，因此在选举时非常慎重、认真。福建省闽清县际台乡酝酿陪审员候选人时，有人提出该乡调解委员会主任潘兴板作风正派，工作积极，可作候选人；但经大家评比后，认为他是“好好先生”，有理不说，没理也不说，不能代表大家掌握审判大权。最后全乡选出许祖长等二人当陪审员。参加这次选举的人数占有选举权总人数的百分之七十五。陪审员是群众认真选举出来的，因而在参加审理案件中能够以主人翁的态度，不仅对案件情况，而且对如何判处，均积极提出自己的意见，使判决公正有据，保障人民群众的权益。甘肃省皋兰县人民法院处理贫农魏永福离婚财产纠纷案，审判员要女方退回财礼，当地妇联选派的陪审员即根据婚姻法精神，指出审判员的错误，保护了妇女利益。同时，在审判过程中因有陪审员参加，可以更加发挥群众协助审判工作的积极性和责任感。沈阳市普选中，人民法庭处理有关选举的诉讼案件时，群众见到有自己选出的代表——陪审员参加审理，对法庭益感亲切，积极地反映情况，有的还自动写成书面材料交陪审员带回法庭，密切了法院与群众的关系。
    其次，陪审员熟悉地方情况，有助于案件的正确处理。俗语说：“做贼瞒不过乡里，偷吃瞒不了牙齿”。陪审员参加审判，容易弄清案情。热河承德县第八区普选中，人民法庭处理地主刘振举是否应剥夺选举权案，刘狡猾地说：“我虽是地主，但土地改革前就参加劳动，土地改革后我也没有违法行为，应有选举权。”当场陪审员就指出他在土地改革前很少劳动，土地改革后又不老实，拉拢干部，并偷过公粮，使他低头服罪。广东省英德县普选中，人民法庭处理有关选民资格案件时，陪审员对该地被管制与漏管制分子，提供了正确而全面的材料，并搜集了不应管制而管制的材料，使法庭做到了不让一个反动分子非法窃取庄严的政治权利，也不使一个公民被错误地剥夺庄严的政治权利。西安市人民法院实行陪审后，群众说：“法院同志熟悉政策，我们——陪审员熟悉情况，两方一凑，案件就处理好了”。此外，有些涉及专门技术问题的案件，因有有关群众团体选派的陪审员参加审理，更可以得到迅速而正确的处理。松江省鹤岗市人民法院处理刘纯、董贵新等破坏矿坑的压风机和水银灯冲电电滚案件时，被邀请参加陪审的工人，揭发了破坏压风机可以引起矿坑内瓦斯爆炸，几百名工人会遭到生命危险，破坏水银灯冲电电滚，会招致全厂生产停顿。这样就使法院认识到这些事件的严重性，做到正确的处理。
    再次，通过陪审员参加审理案件，还可以起法纪宣传教育作用。人民陪审员是由群众选举或群众团体选派的，与群众有密切联系。在参加审判过程中，他一方面可以把案件的情况及群众意见带到法庭上来；另一方面又可以把处理结果和政府的政策、法令带到群众中去。辽西省义县审理医师孙宝瑞给妇女坠胎案时，当地妇联和医务工作者选派陪审员参加案件审判，不但使案件得到正确处理，并且在判决后，他们回到本单位进行了宣传，组织了座谈，收到了防止犯罪的作用。在该案审判前半年中，义县曾发生坠胎案四件；案件处理后半年中，未发生过一次。
    目前已有很多地区结合普选中人民法庭的工作，开展与建立了人民陪审的工作。一般采取以下三种方法：（一）在产生选民资格审查小组人员之同时选出陪审员，使其在人民法庭审理选民资格纠纷等案件时先行参加陪审，经过这一个时期的考验，然后转为正式陪审员；（二）由选民小组或乡村干部提名，经过群众酝酿、法院研究，然后在选民大会上与选举代表同时选举陪审员；（三）有的地区为了避免选举陪审员与选举代表混淆，人民陪审员不在选民大会上与代表同时选出，而在乡人民代表大会上选举产生。此外，有的地区通过建立巡回法庭、结合清理积案来选举陪审员或培养陪审员对象。这些做法都是可行的。但也有的地区对陪审制尚缺乏明确认识，忽视了陪审制的建立；还有的地区虽已建立了陪审制，但对实行陪审的重大意义认识不足，存在着形式主义的“陪审”和使用观点，把陪审变成“听审”。审理案件时，既不说明案情，又不征求陪审员的意见，使陪审流于形式，有名无实。这些情形是必须在今后工作中纠正。
