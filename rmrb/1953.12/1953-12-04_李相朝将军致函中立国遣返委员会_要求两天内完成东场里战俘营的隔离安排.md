    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 3rd: General Li Xiangzhao, Chief Commissioner of the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, today sent a letter to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission stating: "It cannot be allowed that the special agents in the Dongchang-ri prisoner-of-war camp, under the direct command of the United Nations forces, continue to resist the isolation arrangements, making it impossible for our side's explanation work to proceed." Due to the special agents resisting the isolation arrangements, the Korean-Chinese side's explanation work has been forced to be interrupted several times, with the fifth interruption lasting seventeen days. General Li Xiangzhao demanded that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces complete all necessary isolation arrangements for the Dongchang-ri prisoner-of-war camp within two days.
    In the Songgok-ri camp north of the Demilitarized Zone, the Korean-Chinese side arranged isolation facilities as early as October 13th, and recently added heating equipment. Yesterday and today, sixty Rhee's army prisoners of war who had listened to the explanations and did not apply for repatriation have been isolated and guarded by the Indian Custodial Forces in accordance with the provisions of Article 20 of the "Working Procedures."

    李相朝将军致函中立国遣返委员会
    要求两天内完成东场里战俘营的隔离安排
    【新华社开城三日电】军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员李相朝将军今日致函中立国遣返委员会称：“决不能容许东场里战俘营内在联合国军直接指挥下的特务继续抗拒隔离安排，使我方的解释工作不能进行。”由于特务抗拒隔离安排，朝中方面的解释工作被迫数度中断，第五次中断已达十七天。李相朝将军要求中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队在两天之内完成东场里战俘营的一切必要的隔离安排。
    在非军事区北部松谷里营地，朝中方面早在十月十三日就安排了隔离设备，并在最近增设了取暖设备。昨今两日六十名听过解释不申请遣返的李伪军战俘，已由印度看管部队按照“工作细则”第二十款的规定予以隔离看管。
