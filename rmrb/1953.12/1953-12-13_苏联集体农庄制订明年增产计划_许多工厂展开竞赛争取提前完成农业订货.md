Xinhua News Agency, Moscow—Many collective farms in the Soviet Union are formulating plans to increase crop production and further develop livestock farming in 1954. The Voroshilov Collective Farm in the Leninabad region of the Tajik Republic is one of them. The Voroshilov Collective Farm is an advanced farm in the republic. It cultivates 1,900 hectares of cotton, nearly 250 hectares of vegetables and potatoes, 900 hectares of fruits and grapes, and raises nearly 60,000 livestock. The members of the farm recently met to study and determine the plan for expanding the planting area of cotton, vegetables, and potatoes and increasing livestock products next year. It was decided to expand the cotton field by 250 hectares (15 mu per hectare), double the planting area of potatoes, build greenhouses and hotbeds, and expand orchards and vineyards by 50 hectares each next year. In terms of further developing livestock farming, they plan to increase cattle to 250 heads, sheep to 80,000, beehives to 550, and the total number of chickens, ducks, and geese to twice this year's number next year. In the production increase plan for next year, the members of the Voroshilov Collective Farm attach particular importance to improving agricultural techniques and further mechanizing the labor process. They are prepared to use electricity to shear wool and electric milking machines to milk cows next year. They also decided to build two nurseries and a fruit tree nursery covering five hectares for the farm next year. Now they are making every preparation to realize the production increase plan for next year.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow—Many factories in the Soviet Union that accept agricultural orders are launching socialist competitions, constantly improving production levels, and improving product quality, to provide a large amount of fertilizer and effective technical equipment for agricultural production.

Currently, many factories have launched competitions to complete this year's agricultural order production tasks ahead of schedule. The Stalin Electric Chemical Factory in Uzbekistan has completed this year's mineral fertilizer production plan at the beginning of this month and is preparing to produce another 30,000 tons of mineral fertilizer by the end of this year. Since the beginning of this year, the factory's workers have put forward nearly 3,000 rationalization proposals to improve fertilizer production. Worker Sanzherov has put forward more than 100 valuable rationalization proposals this year, and thus won the title of "Excellent Rationalization Producer of the Soviet Chemical Industry." In the Kurgan region, which supplies agricultural needs, the Shadrinsk Steel Rolling Factory has completed this year's production plan and has produced five more carriages of small steel rolling for the countryside.

Many factories in the Soviet Union are producing many new agricultural machines for agricultural production. The Ordzhonikidze Tractor Factory in Kharkov has manufactured high-quality tractor parts with particularly strong magnesium iron. Experimental results have proved that these parts are particularly durable. For example, the crankshaft made by the factory can be used for 3,500 hours more than the specified time. The Uzbekistan Agricultural Machinery Factory plans to produce 500 sets of drug sprayers in the fourth quarter of this year. Now, the factory has completed the complex preparation work in time for the production of new products. In addition, the factory will also produce many new types of machines used in cotton fields.

    苏联集体农庄制订明年增产计划
    许多工厂展开竞赛争取提前完成农业订货
   【新华社莫斯科讯】苏联各地有许多集体农庄正在制订一九五四年提高农作物生产和进一步发展饲畜业的计划。塔吉克共和国列宁纳巴德区伏罗希洛夫集体农庄就是其中的一个。伏罗希洛夫集体农庄是该共和国的一个先进农庄。它种一千九百公顷棉花，将近二百五十公顷蔬菜和马铃薯，九百公顷水果和葡萄，养着将近六万头牲畜。该农庄庄员们最近开会研究并确定了明年扩大棉花、蔬菜、马铃薯种植面积和增加畜产品的计划，决定在明年扩大棉田二百五十公顷（每公顷合十五市亩），把马铃薯种植面积增加一倍，建筑温室和温床，扩大果园和葡萄园各五十公顷。在进一步发展饲畜业方面，他们计划在明年把牛增加到二百五十头，羊增加到八万只，蜜蜂增加到五百五十箱，鸡、鸭和鹅的总只数增加为今年的两倍。在明年的增产计划中，伏罗希洛夫集体农庄庄员们特别重视提高农作技术和使劳动过程进一步机械化。他们准备在明年全部用电力剪羊毛，用电气挤乳机挤牛奶。他们还决定在明年为农庄建筑两个托儿所和占地五公顷的果树苗圃。现在他们正为实现明年的增产计划努力进行一切准备工作。
    【新华社莫斯科讯】苏联各地许多接受农业订货的工厂正在展开社会主义竞赛，不断提高生产水平，改进产品质量，为农业生产大量肥料和效能强大的技术装备。
    目前许多工厂都投入了为提前完成今年度的农业订货的生产任务而展开的竞赛。乌兹别克的斯大林电力化学工厂已在本月初完成了今年生产矿质肥料的计划，并准备到今年年底以前再生产三万吨矿质肥料。今年以来，该厂的工人已提出了将近三千个改进肥料生产的合理化建议。工人桑热罗夫今年已提出了一百多个有很大价值的合理化建议，因而获得了“苏联化学工业优秀合理化生产者”的称号。在供应农业需要的库尔干州，沙德林斯克轧钢工厂已完成了今年的生产计划，并为农村多生产了五个车厢的小型轧钢。
    苏联许多工厂正在为农业生产许多新式的农业机械。哈尔科夫的奥尔忠尼启则拖拉机工厂已经用特别坚固的镁铁制造出质量很好的拖拉机部件。实验结果证明，这些部件特别经久耐用，如该厂制的曲柄轴就可比规定时间多用三千五百小时。乌兹别克农业机器工厂在今年第四季度内，计划要生产五百部药物喷洒机。现在，该工厂已为生产新产品及时完成了复杂的准备工作。此外，该工厂还要生产许多新式的在棉田上使用的机器。
