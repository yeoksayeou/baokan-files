We Must Value the Rationalization Proposals of Workers and Staff
	Sima Jin
	Based on a letter from worker Liu Ansen, the People's Supervision Office of the Ministry of Railways investigated and dealt with the incident of leading cadres of the Wuhan Bridge Engineering Bureau of the New Railway Engineering Bureau, the Changsha Repair Plant, and other units disregarding state property. The correct handling of this incident not only protected state property from damage and struck a blow against the bureaucracy that disregarded state property, but also supported and encouraged the masses to fight against bureaucrats. The enthusiasm of worker Liu Ansen in this incident for protecting state property, his concern for enterprise management, and his spirit of tenacious struggle fully embody the excellent qualities of the working class and the working class's spirit of being masters of the country.
	Relying on the masses to run enterprises well is our fundamental method of managing enterprises. The masses have infinite wisdom and creative power, which is the source of increasing production. In recent years, because we have relied on the broad masses of workers and staff in enterprises, given play to their enthusiasm and creativity, and adopted various rationalization proposals, large and small, sufficient to increase production and economize, the operation and management of enterprises have become increasingly perfect, and production has been able to recover and develop rapidly. However, in the past period, not all enterprises have valued the rationalization proposals of workers and staff, supported the initiatives and inventions of the masses, and adopted and applied them as soon as possible. Many leading cadres of enterprises have taken various incorrect attitudes towards the rationalization proposals of workers and staff. Some people do not believe in the creative ability of the masses, are complacent and accustomed to the so-called "step-by-step" working methods, and are satisfied with the status quo. They do not actively support the rationalization proposals for increasing production or saving resources that the workers and staff have painstakingly researched, but instead use "study it," "pending processing," and "no materials to conduct experiments" as excuses to put them aside and accumulate them for a long time. According to the situations discovered in various places, the rationalization proposals that have been accumulated have been as long as half a year, one year, two years, or even three years; some have even been lost and their whereabouts are unknown. Some enterprises and units seem to value the rationalization proposals of workers and staff, but they have formulated many cumbersome procedures, so that a rationalization proposal goes through more than a dozen processes from registration, review, investigation, approval, and processing... turning around and around, and it cannot be realized for a long time. Some leading cadres of enterprises do not focus on the long-term interests of the country, are stingy about the expenditure of slight experimental fees or other necessary expenses, and ignore rationalization proposals. Some people misunderstand the regular work of mobilizing workers and staff to put forward rationalization proposals as a temporary "crash campaign." During a certain period, they attach great importance to the rational proposals of workers and staff and try their best to adopt them, but after the "movement" is over, they accumulate a large number of them again. The most egregious is the rude and resistant attitude. Some leading cadres of enterprises believe that it is "unnecessary" for workers and staff to put forward rationalization proposals and that it is an "extra burden" for them. Therefore, they not only do not actively support rationalization proposals, but even oppose workers and staff from engaging in research and experiments, and create various obstacles. The rationalization proposal put forward by Gong Caiyuan, a worker in the binding department of the Beijing Xinhua Printing Factory, to change the collating machine from manual to automatic collating, was accumulated for three years. During this period, he made two models, which were discarded by the leading cadres. When he was doing the third experiment in a corner of the party, government, labor union, and youth league office of the workshop, he was even driven out by the chairman of the labor union of the binding department. This is how bureaucrats treat the creations and inventions of workers and staff! Later, thanks to Gong Caiyuan's persistence in fighting against the bureaucrats and the support of the factory's party organization, this proposal was realized.
	Treating the rationalization proposals of workers and staff with a bureaucratic attitude is a criminal act for the revolutionary cause, and it brings incalculable losses to the country's production. The masses of workers and staff directly participate in production and have practical experience. Many of the rationalization proposals they put forward are feasible. Adopting and implementing these proposals will have a great impact on production and the country's construction cause, and will create or save a large amount of wealth for the country. The Dalian No. 1 Construction Engineering Company proved after studying more than 100 accumulated rationalization proposals that most of these proposals were applicable and of great value. It is conceivable that if all feasible rationalization proposals could be adopted in a timely manner, how great an impact it would have on promoting national construction. More importantly, treating rationalization proposals with a bureaucratic attitude strikes and stifles the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses of workers and staff. Since liberation, due to the improvement of their awareness, the broad masses of workers and staff have been actively engaged in production with the attitude of being masters of the country. In order to improve a certain production process and make this improvement contribute to the country, many people have worked hard to study and even sacrificed their rest time. This creative enthusiasm is the driving force for our development of production and should be cherished and cared for. However, this creative activity of the masses of workers and staff has been met with indifference and blows by bureaucrats in some factories and mining enterprises. As a result, the creative enthusiasm of the masses has been reduced, and the rationalization proposals of some enterprises and units have decreased month by month for this reason.
	Comrade Stalin once pointed out the harm of this bureaucracy that stifles the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses in his article "The Rise of Mass Competition and Labor Enthusiasm": "The danger of bureaucracy is primarily and specifically manifested in: it shackles the vitality, initiative, and independent autonomy of the masses; it buries the huge reserve forces hidden within our system, the working class, and the peasantry." Therefore, breaking the shackles of bureaucracy, overcoming the bureaucracy towards the rationalization proposals of the masses, and providing material or spiritual rewards or commendations to those who put forward rationalization proposals are important keys to promoting the wisdom of the masses, promoting the creative enthusiasm of the masses, and improving and improving production. To overcome the bureaucratic style of ignoring the rationalization proposals of workers and staff, first of all, the leading cadres of each enterprise should understand that the various rationalization proposals put forward by workers and staff, regardless of their value, are a concrete manifestation of their love for the motherland and their patriotic labor enthusiasm. Relying on this enthusiasm of the masses is an important method for the leading cadres of enterprises to manage enterprises well and an important guarantee for completing and overfulfilling production plans. The party organizations and supervision departments of enterprise departments should take on the task of ensuring the complete realization of rationalization proposals. For mature and complete rationalization proposals, they should urge the leading cadres of enterprises to implement them as soon as possible. Even for rationalization proposals that are still in the budding state, they should try their best to help workers and staff continue to study them until they are completed. In the process from the proposal to the implementation of rationalization proposals, the party organizations and supervision departments must implement strict supervision, fight against any bureaucrats who accumulate rationalization proposals, and oppose the style of indifference or even suppression of rationalization proposals. Facts have proved that it is very necessary and effective for party organizations and supervision departments to implement supervision. The Shanzhai Coal Mine in Gansu Province did not attach great importance to the rationalization proposals of workers and staff, accumulated a large number of them, and was poorly managed, and could not complete its production tasks for a long time. After the mine's supervision office reported this situation to the Gansu Provincial People's Supervision Committee, the Supervision Committee, the Industry Department, and other departments sent people to conduct an inspection, adopted the rationalization proposals of workers and staff, and improved management and operation. In a short period of time, coal production increased by 59% compared with the past.
	The broad masses of workers and staff, after putting forward rationalization proposals, should not be discouraged or depressed because they are temporarily accumulated. They should urge the realization of rationalization proposals with a spirit of unremitting struggle; if the leading cadres of their own enterprise departments do indeed ignore them for a long time or repeatedly obstruct them, they can report them to the higher authorities, all the way up to the highest leading organs. In our country, any act that strikes at the creative enthusiasm of the masses is not allowed, and any struggle against bureaucracy will be supported by the party and the government. Only by persisting in the struggle to the end like Liu Ansen can one's ideals be finally realized and will it be conducive to the progress of the national construction cause.

    必须重视职工群众的合理化建议
    司马进
    铁道部人民监察室根据工人刘安森来信，检查处理了新建铁路工程总局武汉大桥工程局长沙修配厂等单位领导干部漠视国家财产的事件。这一事件的正确处理，不但保护了国家财产不受损害，打击了漠视国家财产的官僚主义，并且也支持和鼓舞了群众向官僚主义者作斗争。工人刘安森在这一事件中所表现的爱护国家财产的热情，对企业管理的关怀和顽强斗争的精神，充分体现了工人阶级的优秀品质，和工人阶级的国家主人翁气概。
    依靠群众办好企业，是我们管理企业的根本方法。群众有无穷的智慧和创造力量，这种力量就是提高生产的源泉。几年来，由于我们在企业中依靠了广大职工群众，发挥了职工群众的积极性和创造精神，采纳了大大小小足以增产节约的各种合理建议，企业的经营管理才日臻完善，生产才得以迅速恢复和发展。但是，在过去一个时期，并不是所有的企业都已重视了职工的合理化建议，支持了群众的创议和发明，并尽快地加以采纳和应用。不少的企业领导干部，对职工的合理化建议采取了种种不正确的态度。有些人不相信群众的创造能力，因循苟且，习惯于所谓“按步就班”的工作方法，满足现状。他们对职工群众苦心钻研出来的增产或节约的合理建议，不是积极地加以支持，而是以“研究研究”、“待处理”、“没有材料无法作试验”等等作为借口，抛置一旁，长期积压下来。根据各地所发现的情况，被积压的合理化建议，有长达半年、一年、二年甚至三年之久的；有的更被遗失，不知下落。有些企业单位好像重视职工的合理化建议，但制订了许多繁琐累赘的手续，使一个合理化建议从登记、审查、调查、批准、处理……经过十多个过程，转来转去，久久不得实现。有些企业的领导干部，不从国家长远利益着眼，吝惜些微的试验费或其他必需费用的支出，而对合理化建议置之不理。有人则把发动职工群众提出合理化建议的经常工作，误解为临时的“突击运动”，在一个时期之内，对职工的合理建议十分重视，尽量采纳，但“运动”过后，又大批积压下来。最恶劣的是那种粗暴抗拒的态度。有的企业领导干部认为职工提出合理化建议是“多此一举”，对他们是一种“额外负担”，因而不但不积极支持合理化建议，甚至反对职工钻研试验，予以多方阻难。北京新华印刷厂装订部工人贡才元提出的把订本机由人工续本改为自动续本的合理建议，被积压了三年。在这期间，他曾做过二次模型，都被领导干部丢在一旁。他在车间党政工团办公室一个角落里作第三次试验时，更被装订部的工会主席赶了出去。官僚主义者就是这样对待职工的创造发明的！以后，由于贡才元坚持向官僚主义分子作斗争和该厂党组织的支持，这一建议才得实现。
    以官僚主义态度对待职工的合理化建议，对于革命事业来说就是一种犯罪行为，它给国家生产带来不可估计的损失。职工群众直接参加生产，有实际经验，他们所提出的合理化建议，许多都是可行的，采纳和实行这些建议，对于生产，对于国家建设事业，都会发生很大作用，给国家创造或节省大量财富。旅大第一建筑工程公司在研究了一百多件被积压的合理化建议后就证明，这些建议大部分都是适用而且有很大价值的。可以想见，如果所有可行的合理化建议都能及时被采纳，对于推动国家建设将会发生多么大的作用。以官僚主义态度对待合理化建议，更重要的是它打击和窒息了职工群众的积极性和创造性。解放以后，广大职工由于觉悟的提高，都以国家主人翁的态度积极生产，许多人为了改进某项生产过程，使这种改进对国家有所贡献，更刻苦钻研，甚至牺牲自己的休息时间。这种创造热情正是我们发展生产的原动力，应该十分珍贵和倍加爱护的。然而职工群众的这种创造活动在若干厂矿企业却遭到官僚主义者的冷淡和打击，它的结果就是使群众的创造热情降低，有些企业单位的合理化建议逐月减少正是这种原因。
      斯大林同志在“群众的竞赛和劳动热情的高涨”一文中，曾经指出这种扼杀群众积极性和创造性的官僚主义的危害：“官僚主义的危险，首先具体地表现在：它束缚群众的活力、主动性和独立自主精神，它埋没那蕴藏在我们制度内部、工人阶级和农民内部的巨大后备力量”。因此，打碎官僚主义的羁绊，克服对于群众合理化建议的官僚主义，并对提出合理化建议者进行物质的或精神的奖励或表扬，是发扬群众智慧，发扬群众的创造热情，提高和改进生产的重要关键。要克服漠视职工合理化建议的官僚主义作风，首先应使各企业的领导干部懂得，职工提出的各种合理化建议，无论其价值大小，都是热爱祖国，发挥了爱国主义劳动积极性的具体表现。企业的领导干部依靠群众的这种积极性，正是管理好企业的重要方法，是完成和超额完成生产计划的重要保证条件。企业部门的党的组织和监察部门，应当担当起保证合理化建议彻底实现的任务，对于成熟的完整的合理化建议，要督促企业的领导干部尽速实施，就是对于还不成熟的萌芽状态的合理化建议，也应当多方设法，帮助职工继续研究，直至完成。在合理化建议提出到实施的过程中，党的组织和监察部门必须实行严格的监督，向任何积压合理化建议的官僚主义分子进行斗争，而反对那种漠不关心甚至压制合理化建议的作风。事实证明，党组织和监察部门实行监督是十分必要的和有效的。甘肃省山寨煤矿对于职工的合理化建议十分不重视，大批积压，经营管理不当，长时期不能完成生产任务。这一情况经矿的监察室报告甘肃省人民监察委员会，由监察委员会、工业厅等部门派人进行检查后，采纳了职工的合理化建议，改善了管理经营，在短时期内，煤产量即较前提高了百分之五十九。
    广大职工群众，在提出合理化建议之后，不要因为暂时被积压下来而气馁、消沉，应当以不懈的斗争精神，督促合理化建议的实现；如果本企业部门的领导干部确实长期置之不理，或一再阻难，可以向上级告发，一直告发到最高领导机关。在我们的国家，任何打击群众创造性积极性的行为都是不被允许的，任何反对官僚主义的斗争，都会得到党和政府的支持。只有像刘安森一样，坚持斗争到底，自己的理想才终能实现，才有利于国家建设事业的进展。
