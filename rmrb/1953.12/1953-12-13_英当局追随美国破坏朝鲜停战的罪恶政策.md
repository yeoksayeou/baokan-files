Xinhua News Agency, December 10th: British authorities are closely following the United States' sinister policy of undermining the Korean armistice. According to a Reuters report from London on the 7th, British officials are openly trying to shirk responsibility for the US sabotage of the explanatory work, deliberately distorting the facts, and blaming the long-term suspension of the explanatory work due to US-directed special agent sabotage on the Korean-Chinese side. Prior to this, a British Foreign Office spokesman made a statement on November 18, publicly agreeing with Dulles' absurd proposal to "release" prisoners of war after the 120-day neutral nations' custody period "expires." This proves that the series of actions by the United States to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement and forcibly detain prisoners of war has received the support and tacit consent of the United Kingdom. This practice of the British authorities following the United States indicates that the British government has no intention of departing from the US policy of creating international tension to seek a solution to the Korean problem.

Xinhua News Agency, December 11th: The British government is now openly supporting the US in delaying and even sabotaging the bilateral talks on the issue of the Korean political conference. According to Agence France-Presse, British Foreign Office officials admitted on the 9th that the current stalemate in the Panmunjom talks is "very serious," but they said that Britain has agreed to the so-called "suggestions" recently put forward by the US representative Dean. This shows that Britain intends to support the United States in prolonging the "very serious" stalemate in Panmunjom, which was created single-handedly by the United States, so that the United States can avoid the political conference to unilaterally deal with more than 20,000 prisoners of war and forcibly detain them. Britain completely follows the US's opinion, insisting that the Soviet Union should participate in the Korean political conference with voting rights and be bound by all decisions made by the conference. At the same time, the British official propaganda agency, the British Information Service, quoted comments from the "Daily Telegraph" and the "Manchester Guardian," attributing the responsibility for obstructing the agreement to the Korean-Chinese side. The "Manchester Guardian" even said that "the United Nations (especially the United States) has made some concessions to the communist side," supposedly because Dean "no longer refuses neutral observers to attend the entire conference."

This attitude of the British government shows that it intends to continue to violate the interests of the British people in order to serve the US "Cold War" policy that has overwhelmed it, and to help the US maintain international tension. The United Kingdom and the Soviet Union are not belligerents, but it insists on following the United States in listing the Soviet Union as a belligerent. It is clear that Dean's so-called "suggestions" contain nothing new, and that in these so-called "suggestions," neutral countries are merely puppets to be manipulated, rather than independent and self-respecting countries playing a coordinating role. However, the "Manchester Guardian," quoted by the British Information Service, said that these are "some concessions," and even said that "almost no UN member states can object to this new proposal." People remember that Britain has always advocated that India should participate in the political conference as a neutral country. Does Britain really hope that India will only act as a puppet in the political conference? Isn't this an insult to India?

### 英当局追随美国破坏朝鲜停战的罪恶政策

    英当局追随美国破坏朝鲜停战的罪恶政策
    【新华社十日讯】英国当局正紧紧追随美国阴谋破坏朝鲜停战的罪恶政策。据路透社七日发自伦敦的报道，英国官员公开替美国破坏解释工作推卸责任，故意歪曲事实，把解释工作由于美方指使特务破坏而长期停顿说成是责任在于朝中方面。在此以前，英国外交部发言人于十一月十八日发表谈话，公开表示同意杜勒斯要在一百二十天的中立国看管“期满”后“释放”战俘的荒谬主张。这证明：美国破坏朝鲜停战协定、强迫扣留战俘的一系列行动，已经得到了英国的支持和默许。英国当局这种追随美国的作法，表示英国政府无意于离开美国制造国际紧张局势的政策，来谋求解决朝鲜问题。
    【新华社十一日讯】英国政府现在公开支持美国拖延以至破坏关于朝鲜政治会议问题的双方会谈。据法新社报道，英国外交部人士在九日承认，目前板门店会谈中的僵局是“很严重”的，但是他们说，英国已经同意美国代表迪安最近提出的所谓
  “建议”。这就表明英国打算支持美国，把美国一手制造的板门店“很严重”的僵局拖延下去，以便美国躲开政治会议来片面处理二万多名战俘，并把他们强迫扣留。英国完全按照美国的意见，硬说苏联应以有表决权的资格参加朝鲜政治会议，并受会议作出的一切决定的约束。同时，英国官方宣传机关英国新闻处转引“每日电讯报”和“曼彻斯特卫报”的评论，把阻挠达成协议的责任推在朝中方面身上。“曼彻斯特卫报”甚至说“联合国（特别是美国）已经向共方作了一些让步”，据说这是因为迪安“已不再拒绝中立国观察员出席整个会议”。
    英国政府这种态度表明打算继续违反英国人民的利益，来为已把自己压得喘不过气的美国的“冷战”政策服务，帮忙美国保持国际紧张局势。英国与苏联并不是交战国，可是它却硬要跟着美国把苏联列为交战一方。明明迪安的所谓“建议”毫无新的内容，而且在这个所谓“建议”里，中立国只是一个听人摆布的玩偶而不是一个独立自尊的起协调作用的国家，可是英国新闻处所转引的“曼彻斯特卫报”却说这是“一些让步”，还说什么“几乎没有联合国会员国能对这个新建议提出反对意见”。人们记得，英国曾经一直主张印度应该以中立国身份参加政治会议，难道英国竟然希望印度在政治会议中只是充当一个玩偶？难道这不是对印度的一种侮辱？
