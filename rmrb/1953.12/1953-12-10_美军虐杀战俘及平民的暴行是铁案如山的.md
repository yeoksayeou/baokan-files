Xinhua News Agency, December 9th: The U.S. government and its army's heinous atrocities of大规模虐杀 Korean People's Army prisoners of war and North Korean peaceful residents during the Korean War are铁案如山的. Numerous investigation reports published in the past few years have already exposed these atrocities of the United States to the world. In this regard, there are the protest letters repeatedly submitted to the United Nations by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the numerous investigation reports published by the Investigation Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland of Korea, the report published in 1951 by the International Women's Investigation Delegation organized by the Women's International Democratic Federation, the report published in 1952 by the investigation delegation of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, and the report of the International Scientific Commission. These reports were presented after fair and detailed investigations were conducted in areas that had suffered from the ravages of the U.S. military, and they contain countless testimonies and material evidence that irrefutably prove the serious crimes of the U.S. government and its army in violating international law and humanitarian standards.

These investigation reports confirm that the U.S. military brutally mistreated and massacred Korean People's Army prisoners of war. The Investigation Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland of Korea cited some examples in its investigation report on the atrocities committed by the U.S. and Rhee armies in Pyongyang, published at the end of 1950. The U.S. military shot and killed approximately 70 Korean People's Army prisoners of war in Chilbul-ri, Seongdong District, Pyongyang, and another 50 were shot and killed in I-ri, Li-ri. In the severe cold weather of November, prisoners of war in the prisoner-of-war camp at the original site of the Pyongyang Yarn Factory spent the night in the open; sick and wounded prisoners of war did not receive any medical treatment, and many died as a result. The reports of the International Women's Investigation Delegation and the Investigation Delegation of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers also pointed out the crimes of the U.S. military in shooting Korean People's Army prisoners of war.

These investigation reports record in great detail the bloody facts of the U.S. military's mass slaughter of peaceful Korean residents during its temporary occupation of North Korean towns. In Hwanghae Province, the number of people massacred by the occupying forces reached as many as 120,000. In Sinchon County, Hwanghae Province alone, Harrison, the commander of the U.S. occupying forces, personally directed the massacre of 35,383 civilians. During the temporary occupation of Pyongyang, more than 15,000 civilians were killed by the U.S. military and the Rhee puppet army under the command of the U.S. military headquarters. These are just a small part of the peaceful North Korean residents who were brutally massacred by the U.S. military and the Rhee puppet army. These investigation reports list many facts showing that the U.S. executioners who clamored to "exterminate the North Koreans" massacred entire North Korean families, leaving no one alive, old or young. The American murderers did not spare women and children. In many places, the majority of those massacred were women and children.

The methods used by the U.S. military to massacre peaceful residents were appalling. The investigation reports list the U.S. military's methods of mass slaughtering civilians as follows: herding groups of civilians into caves or deep pits, then pouring gasoline on them and burning them alive; gathering groups of civilians and machine-gunning them; burying groups of civilians alive, etc. The U.S. military used various horrific methods to torture and kill civilians: smashing their skulls with axes, cutting up various parts of their bodies to kill them, cutting a slit from the neck to the abdomen with a knife and then skinning them alive to kill them, tying up women as targets for shooting or bayonet practice, cutting open the bellies of pregnant women and taking out the fetuses.... The investigation reports record many shocking incidents manufactured by American murderers. The International Women's Investigation Delegation report records such a tragedy: during the occupation of Sinchon, the U.S. military imprisoned 300 women and children in a warehouse, first starving them, then burying the women alive and starving the children to death.

During the occupation of North Korean towns, the U.S. military wantonly humiliated and abused residents. A large number of residents were arrested without cause and subjected to torture, electric shocks, pouring cold water, gouging out eyes, and other tortures. The U.S. military beastly raped Korean women, raping teenage girls to old women in their sixties and seventies.

When the U.S. military retreated southward, it also coerced tens of thousands of North Korean residents to withdraw southward with them, and then sent planes to bomb and strafe them along the way. For example, when the U.S. military fled from Pyongyang in December 1950, it sent planes to strafe residents who were forced to retreat southward on the banks of the Daedong River. Approximately 4,000 people were killed in this way on December 3rd and 4th. The Daedong River was then filled with corpses, and the blood of the dead turned the river red.

The above investigation reports pointed out that in addition to the U.S. military's large-scale destruction of the North Korean towns it temporarily occupied and the looting of the property of the Korean people during its retreat southward, the U.S. Air Force continuously and systematically bombed peaceful towns behind the front lines during the Korean War. The American aggressors, who clamored to "erase North Korean towns from the map," dropped thousands upon thousands of tons of incendiary bombs, napalm bombs, etc., almost destroying all the buildings in many cities and villages in North Korea. In many cities, all hospitals with prominent Red Cross markings, all school buildings, all churches, and all cultural relics were bombed by U.S. planes. The United States also insidiously targeted grain warehouses and civilian factories for bombing in an attempt to cut off the livelihoods of Korean residents.

The facts in the investigation reports confirm that the U.S. air bandits specifically dropped large quantities of incendiary bombs, fragmentation bombs, and time bombs on the peaceful residential areas of Korean cities and villages. These bandits inhumanly and specifically strafed farmers working in the fields, women washing clothes by the river, and elementary school students returning home from school at low altitudes.

The report of the investigation delegation of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers and the report of the International Scientific Commission also confirm that the U.S. military used bacteriological and chemical weapons on the Korean battlefield and in the rear of North Korea. The evidence of the U.S. military's inhumane germ warfare has been known to the world. The U.S. military not only used poison gas bombs on the battlefield, but also on peaceful Korean residents. For example, on May 6, 1951, three U.S. planes dropped poison gas bombs on Nampo City, causing a total of 1,379 deaths and injuries.

The U.S. military's atrocities are too numerous to mention. The conclusion of the report of the investigation delegation of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers states that these atrocities of the U.S. military violated the Hague Regulations Concerning the Laws and Customs of War on Land of 1907, the Geneva Protocol of 1925 on the Prohibition of the Use of Bacteriological, Chemical and Other Weapons, and the Geneva Conventions of 1929 and 1949 on the Treatment of Prisoners of War, and therefore constituted war crimes as stipulated in Article 6 of the Statute of the Nuremberg International Military Tribunal. The conclusion of the International Women's Investigation Delegation report believes that the U.S. government should bear primary responsibility for these crimes and demands that those responsible for the crimes be listed as war criminals and submitted to a public trial by the people of the world.

    美军虐杀战俘及平民的暴行是铁案如山的
    【新华社九日讯】美国政府及其军队在侵略朝鲜战争中大规模虐杀朝鲜人民军战俘及北朝鲜和平居民的滔天暴行，是铁案如山的。在过去几年中所发表的许多调查报告书，早已向全世界揭发了美国的这种暴行。在这方面，有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府迭次向联合国提出的抗议书和朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线调查委员会发表的多次调查报告书，有国际民主妇女联合会所组织的国际妇女调查团在一九五一年发表的报告书，有国际民主法律工作者协会调查团在一九五二年发表的报告书和国际科学委员会的报告书。这些报告书都是在曾遭受美国军队蹂躏的地区进行了公正的、详细的调查后提出的，其中包含有无数人证和物证，不容置辩地证明了美国政府及其军队破坏国际法准则及人道标准的严重罪状。
    这些调查报告书证实，美国军队曾残暴地虐待及屠杀朝鲜人民军战俘。朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线调查委员会在一九五○年底发表的关于美李军队在平壤所犯暴行的调查报告书就举出了一些例证。美国军队曾在平壤城东区七佛里枪杀了约七十名朝鲜人民军战俘，另有五十人在栗里二里被枪杀。在十一月的严寒天气里，平壤纱厂原址上的战俘营中的战俘们在露天过夜；伤病战俘得不到任何医药治疗，许多人因而死亡。国际妇女调查团及国际民主法律工作者协会调查团的报告书中，也都指出了美国军队枪杀朝鲜人民军战俘的罪行。
    这些调查报告书都以大量篇幅记录着美国军队在暂时侵占北朝鲜城镇期间大量屠杀朝鲜和平居民的血腥事实。在黄海道，被占领军屠杀的人数达十二万人之多。在黄海道的信川面一地，美国占领军司令哈里逊就亲自指挥屠杀了三万五千三百八十三名平民。在平壤被暂时侵占期间，美军及美军司令部指挥下李伪军杀死的平民在一万五千名以上。这些还不过是美军及李伪军残暴地屠杀的北朝鲜和平居民中的一小部分而已。这些调查报告书中列举了许多事实，说明叫嚣着“灭绝北朝鲜人”的美国刽子手们屠杀了整家整家的北朝鲜居民，全家老小一个不留。美国杀人犯也不放过妇女及儿童。在许多地方，被屠杀者中大半是妇女及儿童。
    美国军队用来屠杀和平居民的手段，是令人发指的。调查报告书中列举的美国军队集体屠杀平民的办法有：把成群的平民赶进山洞或深坑，然后浇上汽油放火把他们活活烧死；把成群的平民集中起来，用机枪扫射；把成群的平民活埋等。美军使用各种骇人听闻的手段来虐杀平民：用斧头敲碎他们的头颅，宰割人身各部分来把人弄死，用刀子把人从脖子到腹部割一条缝后活活剥他的皮，把他弄死，把妇女缚起来作为射击或练习刺刀的目标，割开孕妇的肚子把胎儿取出……。调查报告书中记述着美国杀人犯制造的许多惨绝人寰的事件。国际妇女调查团报告书就记述着这样一个惨案：美国军队在侵占信川期间，曾把三百个妇女及儿童监禁在一个仓库里，先使她们挨饿受罪，然后把妇女们活埋，把孩子们活活饿死。
    美国军队在占领北朝鲜城镇时期，恣意凌辱及虐待居民。无故大量逮捕居民，施以拷打、电刑、灌凉水、挖眼睛等酷刑。美国军队野兽般地凌辱朝鲜妇女，对十几岁的少女到六、七十岁的老太婆都横施强奸。
    美国军队在向南溃败时，还胁迫成万北朝鲜居民随同向南撤走，然后在中途又派飞机对他们进行轰炸和扫射。如美军在一九五○年十二月自平壤逃跑时，曾派飞机到大同江岸扫射被迫南撤的居民。在十二月三、四两日中，就这样杀死了约四千人。大同江中当时浮满了死尸，死者的血使江水染成红色。
    上述调查报告书指出，除了美国军队在向南溃败时曾对其暂时侵占的北朝鲜城镇大肆破坏，抢劫朝鲜人民财物以外，美国空军在朝鲜战争期间一直连续不断地、有系统地轰炸战线后方的和平城镇。叫嚣着要把北朝鲜城镇“从地图上抹掉”的美国侵略者，投掷成千成万吨烧夷弹、凝固汽油弹等，几乎毁坏了北朝鲜许多城市和乡村的全部建筑物。在许多城市中，所有有着红十字鲜明标志的医院，所有学校校舍，所有教堂，所有文化古迹，都被美国飞机炸毁了。美国并阴险地把粮食仓库及民用品工厂作为轰炸的目标，企图以此断绝朝鲜居民的生计。
    调查报告书中的事实证实，美国空中强盗特别对朝鲜城市和乡村的和平居民区大量投掷烧夷弹、杀伤弹及定时炸弹等。这些强盗毫无人性地专门低空扫射在田间耕作的农民、在河边洗衣服的妇女、放学归家的小学生等。
    国际民主法律工作者协会调查团的报告书以及国际科学委员会调查团的报告书并且证实，美国军队在朝鲜战场及北朝鲜后方使用了细菌武器及化学武器。美军进行灭绝人性的细菌战的罪证已为全世界所知悉。美军不仅在战场上，而且对朝鲜和平居民施放毒气弹。例如，一九五一年五月六日，美国三架飞机到南浦市施放毒气弹，造成死伤的共有一千三百七十九人。
    美国军队的暴行是罄竹难书的。国际民主法律工作者协会调查团报告书的结论中说，美国军队的这些暴行，破坏了一九○七年关于陆战法规及惯例的海牙章程、一九二五年关于禁止使用细菌、化学等武器的日内瓦议定书和一九二九年和一九四九年关于战俘待遇的日内瓦公约，因而构成了纽伦堡国际军事法庭法规第六条所规定的战争罪行。国际妇女调查团报告书的结论中认为美国政府应对这些罪行负主要责任，并要求把对所犯罪行应负责任的人列为战争罪犯，提交全世界人民公审。
