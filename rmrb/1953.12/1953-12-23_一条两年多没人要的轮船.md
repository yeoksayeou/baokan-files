Reader's Letters Summary:

    A Ship Unclaimed for Over Two Years
    Readers Le Fushan, Pu Shurong, and Zhou Daiqing write: Since 1951, we have been taking care of a large ship abandoned in Daye. This ship, named "Jiyuan," is 11.5 zhang long and 2.2 zhang wide, and inside, there is a large boiler more than 1 zhang high, and two engines. In addition, there are large smokestacks and impellers stored in Yichang, which, with a little repair, can haul 2,000 tons of cargo (upstream).
    The ownership of this ship originally belonged to the Chongqing Hongfa Li Machine Factory. Later, the original Southwest Military and Political Committee found that the Hongfa Li Machine Factory was bureaucratic capital, so it confiscated all the factory's property and sent two comrades to see the ship. They stayed in Daye for two days, said nothing, and left. We were originally workers on the ship and had been transferred to work at the Daye Steel Plant. In order to protect state property from loss, in addition to working in the factory during the day, we came to take care of the ship at night; but we waited for a long time, and no one came to take it over. We sent two or three telegrams and wrote several letters to the Hongfa Li Machine Factory after it was taken over, but we never received a reply. Later, we learned that the original Southwest Military and Political Committee had sent a document to the Huangshi Municipal People's Government regarding this matter, so we went to the secretary's office of the Municipal People's Government to ask. A female comrade surnamed Chen received us and also said that there was such a thing, but she did not find a solution. We kept looking for her five times, and finally she impatiently told us to directly contact the Transportation Department of the Hubei Provincial People's Government. But the Hubei Provincial Transportation Department is in Wuhan, two or three hundred li away from us. How can we delay production to run there? This ship has not been claimed until now. Because it has not been oiled for five years, the iron plates on the hull near the water surface have begun to rust; if this continues, it will cause even greater losses. The ship often leaks water. In order to prevent the ship from sinking, we work all day and go to the ship at night to pump water; this summer, we were too tired and spent money to hire people to help pump water.
    Now the people of the whole country are working hard for increasing production and practicing economy, and building the motherland. This kind of phenomenon of not cherishing state property is really intolerable. We hope that the Ministry of Transportation of the Central People's Government will immediately investigate this issue and ensure that the "Jiyuan" is properly handled quickly.

### 一条两年多没人要的轮船

专栏：读者来信摘要

    一条两年多没人要的轮船
    读者乐福山、蒲树荣、周代清来信：从一九五一年到现在，我们始终在照顾着一条停在大冶没人要的大船。这条船名叫“济远”，长十一丈五尺，宽两丈二尺，里面还有一丈多高的大锅炉、两部发动机；另外还有大烟囱和车叶存在宜昌，如稍加修理，可以拖运两千吨货物（上水）。
    这条船的产权原属重庆洪发利机器厂。后来原西南军政委员会查出洪发利机器厂是官僚资本，就把这个厂的财产全部没收，并派了两位同志来看船。他们在大冶住了两天，啥话没说，就走了。我们原是船上的工人，当时已被调到大冶钢厂工作。为了保护国家财产不遭受损失，我们除了白天在厂里作工外，晚上就来照顾这条船；但等了很久，也没有人来接收。我们打了两三次电报和写了几封信给接收后的洪发利机器厂，始终没见回信。后来打听到原西南军政委员会已就此事行文给黄石市人民政府，于是亲到市人民政府秘书室去问。一位姓陈的女同志接见我们，也说有这回事，却没有设法解决。我们一直找了她五次，最后她不耐烦地要我们直接找湖北省人民政府交通厅。但是湖北省交通厅在武汉，离我们这里有二三百里地，我们怎能耽误生产跑去呢？这条船一直到现在没人要。因为有五年没上油，船身接近水面的铁板已经开始锈坏；如果再拖下去，就会造成更大的损失。现在船里经常进水，为使这条船不致沉没，我们白天工作了一天，晚上还到船上排水；今年夏天，我们实在累不过，就花钱雇人来帮忙排水。
    现在全国人民都在为增产节约、建设祖国而努力，这种不爱惜国家财产的现象实在令人不能容忍。希望中央人民政府交通部立即检查这个问题，并使“济远”号迅速得到合理处理。
