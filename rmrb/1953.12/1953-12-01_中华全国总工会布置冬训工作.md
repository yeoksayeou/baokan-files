All-China Federation of Trade Unions Deploys Winter Training Work

The All-China Federation of Trade Unions recently deployed the 1953 winter training work for basic construction workers.

Last winter, various localities conducted a planned training for basic construction workers. Through this study, workers initially established the idea of being masters of the country, learned many advanced operating methods, and strengthened unity within the working class. In addition, a number of cadres were cultivated and promoted. However, last winter's training did not provide necessary training for cadres and activists. Furthermore, during this year's construction, cadres (both original and newly promoted) were not given the necessary education and assistance. As a result, the ideological and professional levels of cadres are very low, often leading to "commandism" and "tailism" in their work, severely distancing them from the masses. At the same time, last winter's training did not pay widespread attention to the cultivation and training of workers in specialized trades, so some unnecessary difficulties still exist in this year's construction. For this reason, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, when deploying this year's winter training work, put forward the following opinions:

1.  During the idle construction time this winter, all localities should concentrate and universally train grassroots cadres above the level of trade union group leaders and a portion of activists. The training content should include political education and professional education. In terms of political education, the main focus should be on the education of the Party's general line and general task during the transition period, as well as the education of the unity of national interests and individual interests, long-term interests and current interests, and the prospects of communism. In political education, the fact that the working class is the leading class of the country and the worker-peasant alliance is the foundation of our country should be explained and discussed, combined with the country's wage policy, labor protection policy, safety and welfare measures, and the principles of democratic management, so that trainees can recognize the relationship between the individual and the country, understand their position and responsibilities, and the importance of the worker-peasant alliance. Basic knowledge of the Party (including the eight requirements of a Party member) should be explained and discussed to enable them to understand the nature of the Party and the flesh-and-blood relationship between the Party and the working class. Issues related to labor organization, labor discipline, and labor competition should be explained and discussed, so that trainees clearly recognize the importance of rationally organizing the labor force, consolidating labor discipline, and carrying out labor competitions. In terms of professional education, basic knowledge of trade union work should be explained and discussed, such as the nature and role of trade unions, the organizational forms and working methods of trade unions, and the most important and fundamental tasks of trade union work during the period of national construction and in the construction industry, so as to establish a normal order for various tasks. The above content can be appropriately increased or decreased by various localities according to the actual situation. The required teaching materials should be compiled and selected independently. The training time should generally end before the Spring Festival.

2.  The training method can start with several days to summarize and check this year's work experience and problems that have occurred, such as construction plans, construction quality, and violations of operating procedures and labor discipline, so as to combine these practical problems to conduct education and correctly solve problems in administrative management, political work, and the combination of technology.

3.  In order to concentrate efforts on doing a good job in cadre training, this year basic construction workers can be organized to study culture in part or in whole, depending on the conditions and leadership, but no more political training should be conducted, and no more fixed workers should be recruited. If existing fixed workers cannot be organized to study culture, they can be persuaded and mobilized to go home, and a portion of their wages can be paid at the discretion (not exceeding 50% at most). However, they should be gathered together several days before the start of next year's construction to arrange for next year's construction tasks, and to educate them on operating procedures, quality standards, and advanced operating experience. Various localities should train a number of technical workers in trades such as electromechanical installation, machinery operation, electric welding pipelines, and geological drilling according to work needs.

4.  Engineering and technical personnel must also be trained in a concentrated manner, mainly to carry out political education, explain to them the Party's general line during the transition period, improve their political consciousness, especially to establish the viewpoint of relying on the masses, improve their work attitude, so that their technology can be closely integrated with labor. The training time should be at least one month to one and a half months, and should also end before the Spring Festival.

5.  The success of winter training depends on the leadership of the local Party committee. Therefore, under the leadership of the local Party committee, responsible cadres from the basic construction department's Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League should be absorbed to form a winter training committee, and a certain number of full-time cadres should be assigned to form an office. The training work of engineering and technical personnel can be carried out by the administrative side under the leadership of the local Party committee.

6.  All matters related to winter training work, such as training plans, teachers, teaching materials, classrooms, etc., should be prepared immediately. Training funds will be resolved by various localities themselves.

### 中华全国总工会布置冬训工作

    中华全国总工会布置冬训工作
    中华全国总工会最近布置了一九五三年基本建设工人冬训工作。
    去年冬季，各地对基本建设工人曾有计划地进行过一次训练。通过这次学习，使工人初步树立了国家主人翁的思想，学会了许多先进的操作方法，并加强了工人阶级内部的团结。此外还培养与提拔了不少干部。但是去年冬训，对干部与积极分子却没有给予必要的训练，加之今年施工中，也没能对干部（原有的与新提拔的）给予必要的教育与帮助，因而干部的思想水平与业务水平很低，工作中常产生“命令主义”与“尾巴主义”，严重地脱离了群众。同时在去年冬训中，对于特殊工种工人的培养与训练也没有普遍地注意，因此在今年的施工中，一些不应有的困难仍旧存在。为此，全国总工会在布置今年的冬训工作时，提出如下意见：
    一、今年冬季施工空闲时间，各地应把工会小组长以上的基层干部及部分的积极分子，集中地普遍地进行一次训练。训练内容应包括政治教育与业务教育。政治教育方面，主要进行党在过渡时期的总路线总任务的教育，以及国家利益与个人利益、长远利益和目前利益相一致及共产主义的前途教育。在政治教育中应讲解和讨论工人阶级是国家的领导阶级、工农联盟是我们国家的基础，结合国家的工资政策、劳动保护政策、安全福利措施和民主管理的原则，使受训学员认识个人与国家的关系，认识自己所处的地位与应负的责任，以及工农联盟的重要意义；讲解和讨论党的基本知识（应包括党员标准的八个条件），使之认识党的性质、党与工人阶级的血肉关系；讲解和讨论劳动组织、劳动纪律与劳动竞赛方面的问题，使学员明确认识合理地组织劳动力、巩固劳动纪律以及开展劳动竞赛的重要性。在业务教育方面，应讲解和讨论工会工作的基本知识，如工会的性质与作用，工会的组织形式与工作方法，以及在国家建设时期和建筑工业中工会工作最重要最根本的任务，以便建立各种工作的正常秩序。上述内容各地可根据实际情况作必要的增减，所需教材，自行编选。训练时间一般应在春节以前结束。
    二、训练的方法，可先以若干天的时间总结和检查今年的工作经验和发生的问题，如施工计划、施工质量以及违反操作规程与劳动纪律等，以便结合这些实际问题，进行教育，来正确解决在行政管理方面、在政治工作与技术结合等方面的问题。
    三、为了集中力量做好干部的训练工作，今年对基本建设工人可根据条件和领导力量组织一部或全部学习文化，而不再进行政治训练，同时也不应再吸收固定工人；对现有的固定工人如果不能组织他们学习文化，可说服与动员他们回家，酌情发给他们部分的工资（至多不得超过百分之五十），但应在明年施工前若干天集中起来，进行明年的施工任务的布置，并进行操作规程、质量标准和先进操作经验的教育。各地应根据工作需要训练一批机电安装、机械操纵、电焊管道及地质钻探等工种的技术工人。
    四、对于工程技术人员也必须集中地训练一次，主要是向他们进行政治教育，向他们说明党在过渡时期的总路线，提高他们的政治觉悟，特别是树立依靠群众的观点，改进其工作态度，从而使他们的技术能与劳动密切结合。训练时间至少应有一个月至一个半月，亦要在春节以前结束。
    五、冬训工作成效的大小，决定于当地党的领导，因此，必须在当地党委的领导下吸收基本建设部门的党、行政、工会、青年团负责干部组成冬训委员会，并配备一定专职干部组成办事机构。工程技术人员的训练工作，可在当地党委的领导下由行政方面负责进行。
    六、有关冬训工作的一切事宜，如训练计划、教员、教材、教室等，应立即着手准备。训练经费由各地自行解决。
