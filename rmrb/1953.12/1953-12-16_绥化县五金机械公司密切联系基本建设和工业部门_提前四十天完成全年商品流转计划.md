Suihua County Hardware and Machinery Company Closely Connects with Basic Construction and Industrial Departments
    Completes Annual Commodity Circulation Plan Forty Days Ahead of Schedule
    China National Hardware and Machinery Corporation, Qiqihar Branch, Suihua County Company
    (Hereinafter referred to as Suihua County Hardware and Machinery Company) closely connected with basic construction and industrial departments, overfulfilled the annual commodity circulation plan forty days ahead of schedule. The store's annual commodity circulation plan was 24 billion yuan, plus an increased production plan of 539.47 million yuan, all of which were overfulfilled forty days ahead of schedule on November 21st.
    The reason why Suihua County Hardware and Machinery Company was able to complete the commodity circulation plan ahead of schedule was its close connection with basic construction and industrial departments and improved management. The specific methods are:
    1. Thoroughly understand and study the needs of basic construction and industrial departments, and accurately formulate circulation plans.
    The company implemented a system of specific personnel responsible for specific tasks. There are four salespersons who implement a "system of specific personnel responsible for specific systems." The salespersons are required to do a good job of "three types of work" (i.e., company salesperson, fixed user purchasing agent, and national investigator), understand the production rules of factories, mines, and basic construction, market needs, and delve into basic construction and industrial departments. First, they are required to submit plans and study them in detail with various departments. For example, based on the basic construction situation and industrial raw material needs of the Forestry Industry Bureau, they studied with the basic construction section: what commodities are needed? When are they needed? How much is needed? Which unit needs them? After such research, accurate plans were formulated and users were supplied directly to the site. For example, in the second and third quarters, two large trucks of iron wire were shipped directly from Tianjin, and transformers and hardware worth nearly 900 million yuan were shipped directly from Qiqihar City to the Tieli Forestry Industry Bureau. Steel picks, pointed shovels, ventilators, and welding rods from the Railway Materials Factory were allocated to the Railway Administration, solving the problem of work stoppages due to lack of materials at the locomotive depot. Because department stores in various counties were not familiar with hardware, transportation, and electrical equipment, the company organized a commodity exhibition at the end of September during a supply meeting at the wholesale station, introducing the uses, specifications, and names of the commodities, and exchanged opinions. After the meeting, three county department stores and one forest area store submitted order plans and took delivery of goods successively. By closely contacting county department stores and county cooperatives through salespersons, commodity catalogs and price lists were issued on schedule to help them become familiar with the business, enabling them to manage hardware, transportation, and electrical equipment and other commodities. In addition, a fixed user office was established to facilitate procedures, contact work, and exchange opinions. In the past, the Forestry Industry Bureau, the Railway Administration, and the Suileng County Cooperative often went to Harbin to purchase goods, but now the Suihua County Hardware and Machinery Company is responsible for supplying them. Therefore, in October, the company's sales revenue through fixed users accounted for 74.3 percent of the commodity circulation plan.
    2. Accurately and timely organize the source of goods, expanding commodity sales.
    The company implements a monthly analysis of inventory, setting a certain reserve amount for major varieties. Then, according to the fixed user plan and market needs, the variety is expanded, combined with the analysis of inventory, to make an accurate purchase plan, maintaining a certain reasonable inventory. It also helps forest area stores and county department stores and county cooperatives to study and reserve reasonable inventory, so as to avoid backlog or out of stock, encourage their management enthusiasm and improve procedures and systems, and reduce circulation links, expanding commodity sales.
    In addition, in carrying out the increase production and practice economy campaign, the company created the method of picking up goods by number, the iron bar packaging method, promoted the "four-three" and card collection method, the warehouse one-time inventory system, and the Suihua County Department Store No. 1 Wang Fengzhi counter publicity, and implemented a rotating shift system, expanding sales revenue.

    绥化县五金机械公司密切联系基本建设和工业部门
    提前四十天完成全年商品流转计划
    中国五金机械公司齐齐哈尔分公司绥化县公司
  （以下简称绥化县五金机械公司）密切联系基本建设和工业部门，提前四十天超额完成全年商品流转计划。该店全年商品流转计划为二百四十亿元，再加增产计划五亿三千九百四十七万元，一并在十一月二十一日提前四十天超额完成。
    绥化县五金机械公司能提前完成商品流转计划的原因是密切联系基本建设、工业部门，改善经营，其具体的做法是：
    一、深入了解和研究基本建设、工业部门的需要，准确拟定流转计划。
    该公司实行了专人负责制。有四名推销员，实行“系统专人负责制”。在推销员中并提出要作好“三员工作”（即公司推销员、固定用户采购员、国家的调查员），了解工厂、矿山、基本建设的生产规律，市场需要，深入基本建设、工业部门，首先要求提出计划，并和各部门详细研究。如根据森林工业局基本建设的情况和需用工业原料等，和基本建设科研究：用什么商品？什么时间用？要多少？那个单位用？通过这样研究后，准确拟定计划，采取直发用地的办法供应用户。如二、三季度由天津直发铁丝两大车、由齐齐哈尔市直发变压器和五金等价值将近九亿元的商品给铁力森林工业局。把铁路材料厂的钢镐、尖锹、通风器、电焊条拨给铁路管理局，解决了机务段的停工待料问题。各县百货商店因对五金、交通、电工器材的业务不熟，该公司在九月末趁批发站开供应会议时组织了商品展览会，介绍商品的用途、规格、品名等，并交换了意见。会后有三个县百货商店、一个林区商店提出了要货计划，相继取了货。通过推销员和县百货商店、县合作社密切联系，按期发给商品目录、牌价，帮助他们熟悉业务，使他们能经营五金、交通、电工器材等商品。另外设立固定用户办公室，便于办理手续、联系工作、交换意见等。过去森林工业局和铁路管理局、绥棱县合作社经常到哈尔滨去采购货物，现在由绥化县五金机械公司负责供应。因此该公司十月份通过固定用户的卖款占商品流转计划的百分之七十四点三。
    二、准确及时地组织货源，扩大了商品推销。
    该公司实行每月分析一次库存，把主要品种定出一定的储备量。再根据固定用户计划和市场需要扩大品种，结合分析库存，作出准确的进货计划，保持一定的合理库存。并帮助林区商店和县百货商店、县合作社研究储备合理库存，免得发生积压或脱销，鼓励其经营积极性并改进手续制度，减少流转环节。扩大了商品推销。
    此外，该公司在开展增产节约竞赛运动中，创造了取货对号、铁筋包装法，推广了“四三”和卡片收款法，仓库一次清点制以及绥化县百货第一商店王凤芝柜台宣传等经验，实行了轮休制，扩大了卖钱额。（杜若　刘志先）
