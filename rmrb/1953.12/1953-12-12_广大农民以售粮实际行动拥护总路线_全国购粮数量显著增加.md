    Broad Masses of Farmers Support the General Line with Actual Grain Sales
    National Grain Purchase Volume Increases Significantly
    [Our Newspaper] In November, all parts of the country extensively promoted the general line for the transition period to the farmers, which greatly inspired the patriotic enthusiasm of the farmers and powerfully promoted the state's grain purchasing work. In November, the national grain purchase volume increased by 83.51 percent compared to October, with rice increasing by 44.99 percent, soybeans increasing by 178.66 percent, and miscellaneous grains increasing by 118.45 percent. Compared with the same period last year, the national grain purchase volume in November also increased by 27.53 percent. The grain purchase volume in November in all major administrative regions increased significantly compared to October. The Northeast region increased by 311.31 percent, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region increased by 393.61 percent, and other major administrative regions increased by 21 to over 64 percent. Compared with the same period last year, the grain purchase volume in November in all major administrative regions also generally increased, with the Northwest and Inner Mongolia increasing by over 150 percent, and the Central South and Southwest increasing by over 85 percent. This is a preliminary victory on the grain front after the launch of the general line propaganda in various places.
    Since November, the CCP committees and governments at all levels have successively convened cadre meetings at the provincial, county, district, and township levels to convey the general line for the transition period and study the work of mobilizing farmers to sell surplus grain. After in-depth study and discussion, the cadres participating in the meetings clearly recognized that farmers should regard selling surplus grain to support the country's economic construction as a practical action to support the general line for the transition period, and only when the country realizes socialist industrialization can the production and life of farmers be greatly improved. After participating in these meetings, the vast number of rural cadres became the backbone of propagating the general line to the farmers and mobilizing the farmers to sell surplus grain. In November, the CCP committees and governments in many regions also conducted typical experiments in key townships and villages to propagate the general line to the farmers. In the propaganda, Liuhe County in Liaodong Province, Kangping County in Liaoxi Province, Chongqing County in Sichuan Province, and Yanggao County in Shanxi Province, etc., used vivid and specific methods such as holding exhibitions and helping farmers calculate detailed accounts, which achieved good results.
    After receiving the propaganda and education on the state's general line for the transition period and selling surplus grain to the state, farmers in various places were all elated and actively sold surplus grain. "Selling surplus grain to the state for the construction of the motherland" has become the action slogan of the broad masses of farmers. Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, cadres, agricultural labor models, agricultural production cooperatives, and mutual aid teams in rural areas have played a leading and exemplary role in selling surplus grain. The Xinli Village, Xiaobeijiangu, and Dachengzhuang agricultural production cooperatives in Ninghe County, Hebei Province, sold 1.01 million, 840,000, and 620,000 jin of rice to the state, respectively. In the main grain-producing areas of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou in the Southwest region, the members of mutual aid teams sold an average of about 1,000 jin of grain. In the sale of grain in various places, exemplary cases such as children mobilizing their parents, daughters-in-law mobilizing their parents-in-law, and couples mobilizing each other have also appeared. Wang Caiyun, a Communist Party member in Nanloudi Township, Anguo County, Hebei Province, used the method of comparing the old and new societies to mobilize her parents-in-law to sell all 1,038 jin of surplus grain to the state. Under her influence, ten female party members in Nanloudi Township have mobilized their families to make grain sales plans.
    This year, the national grain crops have not decreased in yield on the basis of last year's bumper harvest. The recent situation in key experimental areas shows that after in-depth propaganda of the state's general line for the transition period, farmers have realized the relationship between the future of the country and the future of individuals, and farmers will sell large quantities of surplus grain. Eleven percent of farmers in Yushu County, Jilin Province, still have last year's surplus grain in the autumn of this year. In Zhonghe Village and Guanglong Village in the county, 26 to 40 percent of farmers, in addition to this year's new grain, can eat last year's old grain until the Dragon Boat Festival in May next year. The county has a total surplus of more than 300 million jin, and after preliminary education on the general line, the farmers have sold more than 100 million jin. The materials from typical surveys in rural areas in various places also show that due to successive years of bumper harvests, some wealthy farmers have stored large quantities of grain. Eighty percent of farmers in Wuhuaying Village and Xiaotun Village in Nanle County, Henan Province, have stored surplus grain accounting for 15 to 38 percent of the yield. Thirty-five percent of farmers in Zhongle Village, Anyang County, a cotton-producing area in Henan, have surplus grain, with those who have less being able to eat until the end of next year and those who have more being able to eat until 1956. In Douma Township, Xingping County, Shaanxi Province, more than 100 farmers have not increased production as much as other farmers over the years due to a lack of livestock, but they all have 4,000 to 5,000 jin of surplus grain at home. In December, all parts of the country will carry out larger-scale and in-depth propaganda of the state's general line for the transition period to the farmers, and it is expected that the sale of surplus grain by farmers will soon form a climax.

    广大农民以售粮实际行动拥护总路线
    全国购粮数量显著增加
    【本报讯】十一月份，全国各地普遍开始大张旗鼓地向农民宣传国家过渡时期的总路线，大大激发了农民的爱国热情，有力地推动了国家收购粮食的工作。十一月份全国收购粮食数量比十月份增加百分之八十三点五一，其中大米增加百分之四十四点九九，大豆增加百分之一百七十八点六六，杂粮增加百分之一百一十八点四五。十一月份全国购粮数量和去年同期比较，也增加了百分之二十七点五三。各大行政区十一月份购粮数量都比十月份增加很多。东北区增加百分之三百一十一点三一，内蒙古自治区增加百分之三百九十三点六一，其他大行政区增加百分之二十一到百分之六十四以上。各大行政区十一月份购粮数量和去年同期比较，也普遍增加，西北、内蒙古都增加百分之一百五十以上，中南、西南都增加百分之八十五以上。这是各地展开总路线宣传以后，在粮食战线上的初步的胜利。
    十一月份以来，各地中共党委和政府先后召开了省一级的和县、区、乡三级的干部会议，传达了国家过渡时期的总路线，研究了动员农民出售余粮的工作。参加会议的干部经过深入的学习讨论，明确认识到农民应该把出售余粮支援国家经济建设，作为拥护国家过渡时期总路线的实际行动，只有国家社会主义工业化了，农民的生产和生活才能大大提高。参加过这些会议以后，广大农村干部便成了向农民宣传总路线和动员农民出售余粮的骨干。许多地区的中共党委和政府，在十一月份并深入重点乡、村，进行了向农民宣传总路线的典型试验。在宣传中，辽东省柳河县、辽西省康平县、四川省崇庆县、山西省阳高县等运用了举行展览会、帮助农民算细账等生动、具体的方法，收到很好的效果。
    各地农民在受到国家过渡时期总路线和把余粮卖给国家的宣传教育以后，都欢欣鼓舞积极出售余粮。“为了建设祖国，把余粮卖给国家”，已成为广大农民的行动口号。各地农村的共产党员、青年团员、干部、农业劳动模范和农业生产合作社、互助组，在出售余粮中起了带头模范作用。河北省宁河县的新一村、小北涧沽、大陈庄这三个农业生产合作社就分别卖给国家一百零一万斤、八十四万斤和六十二万斤稻谷。西南区四川、云南、贵州各地主要产粮区互助组的组员售粮数量平均在一千斤左右。各地售粮中，还出现了儿女动员父母、媳妇动员公婆、夫妻互相动员等模范事例。河北省安国县南楼底乡共产党员王彩云用新旧社会对比的方法，动员公婆把一千零三十八斤余粮全部卖给了国家。在她的影响下，南楼底乡已有十名妇女党员动员家庭订出了售粮计划。
    今年全国粮食作物在去年丰收的基础上，产量未减。最近各重点试验地区的情况表明，经过深入地宣传国家过渡时期总路线，使农民认识到国家前途和个人前途的关系，农民会出售大批余粮。吉林省榆树县有百分之十一的农户今秋还存有去年的余粮。该县中和村和光龙村有百分之二十六到百分之四十的农户，除今年新粮外，去年的陈粮可吃到明年五月节。该县共约有余粮三万万多斤，农民初步受到总路线的教育后，已出售一万万多斤。各地农村典型调查的材料，也说明了由于连年丰收，一部分富裕农民大量储存着粮食。河南省南乐县五花营村、小屯村有百分之八十的农户储有占产量百分之十五到三十八的余粮。河南棉产区安阳县众乐村有百分之三十五的农户存有余粮，余粮少者可吃到明年年底，多者可吃到一九五六年。陕西省兴平县窦马乡有一百多户农民因缺乏牲畜，历年不如其他农民增产的多，但他们家中也都存有四、五千斤余粮。十二月份，全国各地将以更大规模深入地向农民宣传国家过渡时期的总路线，预期农民出售余粮
  即将形成高潮。
