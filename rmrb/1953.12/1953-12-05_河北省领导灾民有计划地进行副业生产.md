Hebei Province's party and government leading organs at all levels are actively finding ways from various aspects to guide and support some disaster-stricken people to carry out planned winter sideline production, and have achieved remarkable results.

When the autumn plowing and sowing were nearing completion in some disaster-stricken areas of Hebei Province, they immediately shifted to leading sideline production. In September, the Hebei Provincial People's Government issued a notice requiring the affected special districts and counties to conduct detailed surveys of the types, output, specifications, and market needs of local sideline products, in order to rank the products according to the source of raw materials and the sales of finished products. After investigation and research, it was decided to focus on several major sidelines such as saltpeter, crude sodium sulfate, homespun cloth, pockets, sacks, and shoe soles as the main winter production projects. In order to expand sales channels and ensure a balance between production and sales, the relevant leading departments, in addition to investigating the sales volume in the province, also signed saltpeter sales contracts with some factories in other places, found a sales channel for crude sodium sulfate in Tianjin, and signed pocket and shoe sole sales contracts with relevant units in Heilongjiang, Beijing, and other places. According to the above contracts and the quantity required in the province, the various production figures were distributed to the disaster-stricken counties according to different sideline bases. At the same time, technical training was conducted for the masses with poor skills to improve product quality and ensure compliance with specifications.

The relevant departments in the province also did a good job in coordinating to support disaster victims in carrying out sideline production. The Provincial Finance Committee has notified the various financial and economic departments to formulate a goods allocation plan in stages and sections according to the business of their respective units. The Provincial Cooperative General Society also issued instructions in September, emphasizing that cooperatives in disaster areas should do a good job in supplying materials and purchasing local and sideline products to support disaster victims' production. The Cang County Special District's economic departments have successively transferred more than 60 cadres to go deep into the disaster areas to specifically organize supply and purchase work. In order to better support winter production by disaster victims, in early November, eighteen water conservancy projects in the province began construction using the work-for-relief method. The wages earned by the laborers have also promoted winter production. Among the 250 laborers in the seventh district of Jiaocheng County, 160 have made production plans. Hebei Province is actively leading and supporting disaster-stricken people to carry out production, solving the living problems of the disaster victims, and stabilizing the emotions of a few people who were preparing to sell livestock and flee famine.

    河北省领导灾民有计划地进行副业生产
    河北省各级党政领导机关从多方面积极想办法，领导和扶持部分受灾群众进行有计划的冬季副业生产，现已获得显著成绩。
    河北省部分受灾地区在秋耕秋种将近结束时，立即转入了对副业生产的领导。河北省人民政府在九月份即发出通知，要求受灾各专、县详细调查当地副业产品的种类、产量、规格和市场需要等方面的情况，以便根据原料来源和成品销路进行产品排队。经调查研究后，便确定抓住火硝、皮硝、土布、口袋、麻袋、鞋底等几种大宗副业，作为冬季生产主要项目。为了开拓销路，保证产销平衡，有关领导部门除调查省内销售量外，并和外地某些工厂签订火硝销售合同，在天津找到了皮硝的销路，又和黑龙江、北京市等有关单位订立口袋和鞋底销售合同。根据以上合同和省内所需数量，便将各项生产数字按不同的副业基础分配给各受灾县。同时对技术较差的群众进行了技术传授，以提高产品质量，保证合乎规格。
    该省各有关部门对支持灾民进行副业生产的配合工作也做得较好。省财委曾通知各财经部门根据本单位业务分期分段做出货物调拨计划。省合作总社在九月份也曾发出指示，强调灾区合作社要做好物资供应和土副产品的收购工作，以支持灾民生产，沧县专区各经济部门已先后抽调干部六十多人，深入灾区具体组织供应和收购工作。为了更好地支持灾民冬季生产，十一月初，该省有十八项水利工程用以工代赈的方式开始施工。民工所得工资又推动了冬季生产，交河县七区民工二百五十人中已有一百六十人作好生产计划。河北省积极领导和支持受灾群众进行生产，解决了灾民的生活问题，使少数准备出卖牲畜和出外逃荒的人稳定了情绪。（枕亚）
