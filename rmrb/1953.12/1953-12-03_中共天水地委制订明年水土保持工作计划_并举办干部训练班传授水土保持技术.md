The CCP Tianshui Prefectural Committee Formulates Next Year's Soil and Water Conservation Work Plan and Holds Cadre Training Class to Impart Soil and Water Conservation Technology

In order to strive for increased production in mountainous areas next year, the Chinese Communist Party Tianshui Prefectural Committee has formulated a soil and water conservation work plan for 1954. It also requires Party committees at all levels to carry out various preparatory work according to the plan, laying the foundation for the full-scale development of soil and water conservation work next year.

More than 88 percent of the cultivated land in the Tianshui Special District is mountainous. Doing a good job in soil and water conservation and gradually achieving "water not leaving the tableland, soil not leaving the slope, mud not leaving the gully, and sand not flooding the land" is the main key to increasing grain production in mountainous areas and is also a major task in leading agricultural production.

The 1954 plan calls for building 850,000 mu of field ridges throughout the district, promoting sweet clover and alfalfa on 120,000 mu, planting 210,000 fruit trees, and cultivating more than 4,000 mu of seedlings, etc.

Before liberation, in the Tianshui area, due to the long-term rule of feudal landlords, forests and grasslands were severely damaged. More than 80 percent of the rainfall was concentrated in the summer and autumn seasons, and there were also frequent torrential rains and hailstorms. The soil structure was eroded and destroyed, and most of the water was lost. The amount of fertile soil washed away by the Hulu River each year is equal to the topsoil layer of the entire cultivated land area of Wushan County. Serious soil erosion has gradually fragmented the terrain, reduced land productivity, and impoverished the lives of people in mountainous areas for a long time. After liberation, the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government began to pay attention to soil and water conservation work. They convened district-wide soil and water conservation symposiums, dispatched soil and water conservation cadres to go deep into the countryside to understand the soil and water conservation work among the masses, and issued soil and water conservation loans, etc. The district's soil and water conservation work has achieved preliminary results. According to incomplete statistics, since liberation, more than 100,000 mu of field ridges have been built throughout the district, more than 20,000 mu of sweet clover have been promoted, more than 9.73 million trees have been planted, more than 56,600 mu of afforestation has been carried out, and key demonstrations have been made in ridge cultivation areas and gully afforestation. Last year, some areas also mobilized the masses to dig waterlogged ponds and build dikes. However, in general, there are still serious shortcomings in soil and water conservation work. The main reason is that cadres do not have sufficient understanding of the importance of soil and water conservation work and mountain production. The original feasible soil and water conservation experiences among the masses have not been well summarized and promoted. Forestry policies have not been implemented enough, and the phenomena of indiscriminate reclamation and deforestation still exist to varying degrees, and soil erosion is still very serious.

In order to systematically improve agricultural production in mountainous areas and do a good job in soil and water conservation, the CCP Tianshui Prefectural Committee held another soil and water conservation cadre training class mainly for county and district cadres. The trainees included 143 county and district-level cadres, 20 bank and financial department cadres, and 24 labor models.

The learning content mainly included soil and water conservation common sense, terraced field cultivation methods, field engineering, forestry technology, and grass-crop rotation, etc. The teachers were technical cadres from soil and water conservation promotion stations, agricultural work stations, and forestry bureaus.

After nearly a month of study, the trainees have further realized the seriousness of soil erosion and the importance of soil and water conservation. In particular, the comparison between good and bad and on-site visits have been very educational for everyone. In the sixteenth district of Tianshui County, where there were no terraces, after a rainstorm in May this year, several thousand mu of topsoil on sloping land was washed away, and production suffered serious losses; Deng Zhaocheng, a farmer in Wushan County, has been building field ridges and terraces for years, not only avoiding floods, but also increasing his harvest by 30 percent compared to neighboring un-terraced fields. Through these comparisons and visits, the trainees criticized the erroneous views on soil and water conservation.

In the study, the principles of discussion and practice as the main focus, lectures as a supplement, mutual teaching and learning, and learning while teaching were adopted, so that theory and practice, summarizing local experience and imparting scientific and technological knowledge were further combined, improving the teaching effect. In the internship, twelve plots with different slopes, soil quality, sunshine, and surrounding environment were selected in advance. After the teachers introduced the situation, everyone was divided into groups for practice and discussion, and came up with specific feasible and permanent solutions for the present. After the internship, the labor models reflected:

"This kind of internship is useful. Relying solely on classroom lectures, no matter how well they are delivered, we can't remember everything." The cadres also reflected: "This is like diagnosing the land's illness,"
"Gold is everywhere, it depends on whether you look for it or not."

In their studies, the trainees criticized the past subjectivism and commandism in soil and water conservation work. For example, in forest protection work, there was a phenomenon of random confiscation. At the same time, after studying rural policies, the trainees clearly recognized the direction of rural work, realized that to do a good job in soil and water conservation, it is necessary to closely cooperate with the mutual aid and cooperation movement and the patriotic production increase movement, gradually implement the socialist transformation of the small-scale peasant economy, systematically promote soil and water conservation technology, steadily increase yield per unit area, and improve the lives of people in mountainous areas.

    中共天水地委制订明年水土保持工作计划
    并举办干部训练班传授水土保持技术
    中国共产党天水地方委员会为争取明年山地增产，制订了一九五四年水土保持工作计划。并要求各级党委根据计划进行各种准备工作，给明年全面开展水土保持工作打下基础。
    天水专区的耕地百分之八十八以上都是山地，作好水土保持工作，逐步做到“水不下塬，土不出坡，泥不出沟，沙不漫地”，是提高山地粮食产量的主要关键，也是领导农业生产的一项主要任务。
    一九五四年计划要在全区培地埂八十五万亩，推广草木樨和苜蓿十二万亩，栽植果木二十一万株，育苗四千多亩等。
    解放前，天水地区，由于土地长期被封建地主统治，森林草原遭到严重破坏，百分之八十以上雨水集中在夏秋两季，又多急雨冰雹，土壤结构被冲刷破坏，水分大部流失。该区葫芦河每年冲去的肥土量即等于武山县全部耕地面积的耕作层土壤量。严重的水土流失，使地形逐渐支离破碎，土地生产力逐渐减低，山区人民生活长期贫困。解放后，中国共产党和人民政府开始重视了水土保持工作。召开全区水土保持座谈会，派遣水土保持干部深入农村了解群众中的水土保持工作，发放水土保持贷款等。全区水土保持工作已获得了初步成绩，据不完全统计，解放后，全区已培地埂十万多亩，推广草木樨二万多亩，植树九百七十三万多株，造林五万六千六百多亩，垅作区田、沟壑造林等都作了重点示范，去年部分地区，还发动群众挖涝池和修堤坝。但是总的说来，水土保持工作还存在着严重缺点，主要是干部对水土保持工作、对山区生产的重要性认识不足。群众中原有的可行的水土保持经验没有很好地总结推广，林业政策贯彻不够，乱垦乱伐现象还程度不同的存在，水土流失现象还很严重。
    为有计划地逐步地改善山区农业生产，作好水土保持工作，中共天水地委又举办了一次以县、区干部为主的水土保持干部训练班。参加训练班的学员，有县、区级干部一百四十三名，银行财经部门干部二十名，劳动模范二十四名。
    学习内容主要是水土保持常识、山田耕作法、田间工程、林业技术和草田轮栽等。教员由水土保持工作推广站、农业工作站和林业局等单位技术干部充任。
    经过近一个月的学习，学员们对上述水土流失的严重性和水土保持的重要性已有进一步的认识。特别是经过好坏对比和实地参观对大家的教育很大。天水县十六区没有修梯田的地方，在今年五月下了场暴雨后，几千亩坡地表土被冲，产量遭到严重的损失；武山县农民邓兆成因连年培地坎、修梯田、不但避免了水灾、收成也比邻近未修梯田的增加百分之三十。通过这些对比和参观，学员们批判了对水土保持的错误看法。
    在学习中采取了以讨论实习为主、讲课为辅，互教互学、边教边学的方针，因而使理论和实际、总结当地经验和传授科学技术进一步地结合，提高了教学效果。在实习当中，事先选择十二块坡度、土质、阳光及周围环境各不相同的地块，由教员介绍情况后，大家就分组实习讨论，想出当前具体可行和永久性的办法。实习后，劳动模范们反映：
  “这样实习才有用处，光靠课堂听讲，讲得再好也不能全记下。”干部也反映：“这才是给地看了病”、
  “遍地是黄金，看你寻不寻”。
    学员们在学习中，批判了过去水土保持工作中的主观主义和强迫命令作风。如在护林工作中发生乱没收现象。同时，经过学习农村政策，学员们明确地认识了农村工作方向，认识到要作好水土保持工作，必须和互助合作运动与爱国增产运动密切配合，逐步实行对小农经济的社会主义改造，有计划地推行水土保持技术，稳步提高单位面积产量，改善山区人民生活。（白槐）
