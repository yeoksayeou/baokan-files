Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 18th: Fifty state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private major factories and mines in the Southwest region completed their November production plans; including 31 large factories and mines in Chongqing and various factories and mines under the iron and steel industry system. In addition, according to incomplete statistics, 16 factories and mines completed their annual production plans ahead of schedule. These factories and mines include the 401 Coal Mine, China Wool Textile Factory, Kunming Smelting Plant in Yunnan, Yunnan Cigarette Factory, etc. The annual production plans for eight major products, such as steel rails, steel plates, steel billets, and forged steel, of Chongqing's 101 and 102 Steel Plants were also completed ahead of schedule in November; these two plants also overfulfilled their annual profit delivery plans ahead of schedule.

Although the requirements of the November production plans of various factories were higher than those of October, the completion of the plans was better than in October. In November, the production plans for most major products were completed. Among the 29 major products of factories and mines in Chongqing, 26 were completed, an increase of three compared to October. In October, most factories and mines did not perform well in completing their plans in the first ten days of the month, and they launched shock campaigns to catch up with tasks in the middle and late ten days. However, in November, most factories and mines have achieved balanced production every ten days according to the operation plan. In addition, the safety production work of many factories has also improved compared to October, and production accidents in general factories and mines have generally decreased.

The main reasons why the factories were able to achieve the above results are: in the process of studying the general line of the state, the broad masses of workers realized the great significance of completing the production plan to accelerate the country's socialist industrialization, and thus more deeply launched the production increase and economy practice competition centered on implementing the operation plan. In the competition, many factory and mine workers set off a wave of learning advanced experience. Chongqing State-owned No. 611 Yarn Factory learned from the Soviet advanced experience and improved the drafting of the front spinning machine, reducing the yarn breakage rate by 40%. The factory's maintenance, spinning, and doffing workers also respectively promoted the "Five-Three Maintenance Work Method," "Pagoda-style Coarse and Fine Sectional Work Method," and "Chen Shulan Doffing Work Method," and other advanced work methods, which played a significant role in the factory's overall completion of the November output, quality, and cost plans.

### 西南五十个主要厂矿完成上月份生产计划  大部工厂都作到每旬按作业计划均衡进行生产

    西南五十个主要厂矿完成上月份生产计划
    大部工厂都作到每旬按作业计划均衡进行生产
    【新华社重庆十八日电】西南区有五十个国营、地方国营、公私合营的主要厂矿完成了十一月份生产计划；其中有重庆市的大型厂矿三十一个和钢铁工业系统所属各厂矿。另外据不完全统计，有十六个厂矿提前完成了全年生产计划。这批厂矿包括有四零一煤矿、中国毛纺厂，云南的昆明冶炼厂、云南纸烟厂等。重庆一零一和一零二钢铁厂的钢轨、钢板、钢胚、锻钢材等八项主要产品的全年生产计划，也都在十一月份提前完成了；这两个厂还提前超额完成了全年上缴利润计划。
    各厂十一月份的生产计划的各项要求虽然订得比十月份高，但完成计划的情况都比十月份好。十一月份中，大多数主要产品的生产计划都完成了。重庆市各厂矿的二十九种主要产品的生产计划，有二十六种完成，完成计划的产品比十月份增加了三种。在十月份中，大多数厂矿在上旬完成计划的情况不好，到中旬下旬就发动职工突击赶任务。但在十一月份中，绝大部分厂矿都已作到每旬按作业计划均衡地进行生产。此外，许多厂的安全生产工作也比十月份有了改进，一般厂矿在生产上的事故都普遍减少了。
    各厂能取得上述成绩的主要原因是：广大职工在学习国家总路线过程中，认识到完成生产计划对加速国家社会主义工业化的重大意义，因而更加深入地展开了以贯彻推行作业计划为中心的增产节约竞赛。在竞赛中许多厂矿职工都掀起了学习先进经验的浪潮。重庆国营六一一纱厂学习了苏联先进经验，改进了前纺机器的牵伸，使细纱断头率降低了百分之四十。该厂的保全、细纱和落纱工人还分别地推广了“五三保全工作法”，“宝塔式粗细分段工作法”和“陈树兰落纱工作法”等先进工作法，这对该厂全面完成十一月份产量、质量、成本计划起了很大作用。
