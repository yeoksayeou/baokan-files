In the construction of highways in various regions, enthusiastic support and assistance have been received from peasants and herdsmen of all ethnic groups along the routes.

    During the construction of the Kangzang Highway, Tibetan people in various areas along the route organized tens of thousands of yaks to transport large quantities of materials to the construction site. During transportation, the Tibetan people cherished state-owned materials as if they were their own belongings. If a sack was torn, they would sew it up with their own needles and thread. On rainy and snowy days, they would cover the materials with their own pulu (Tibetan woolen fabric). Xirao Senggen of Lado Zong (county), after completing his own transportation task, took another 1,200 yaks across the border to other zong for transportation. People of all zong in the Qamdo region more enthusiastically organized "Tibetan Labor Teams," with hundreds and thousands of Tibetan people participating in road construction. The Tibetan people who participated in the construction of the Lhasa to Taizhao section also demonstrated their labor enthusiasm, continuously improving work efficiency. Many Tibetan people who had never used shovels or picks quickly learned road construction techniques. One group created a new record of digging five cubic meters of soil per person per day, and many model individuals emerged. When building post roads within the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province, the Yi people of Jiulong County automatically participated in road construction. Tibetan laborers in Litang County, in order to complete the post road construction early, used cow dung to melt the ice on the road surface, paving more than 200 li of road in one month. Many Tibetan women also voluntarily ground zanba (roasted barley flour) and brewed tea for the road construction workers. The Tibetan people along the Qingzang Highway expressed great welcome for the highway construction. They voluntarily collected yak dung for the road construction workers to use as fuel, and also organized a transportation team of 2,000 yaks. When the Huanghe (Yellow River) wooden pontoon bridge was under construction, the Tibetan people brought fresh milk and ghee from more than 20 li away every morning for the workers to eat. When Qinghai Province was repairing the Tongren-Xunhua Highway, more than 500 Tibetan people participated, and they also launched a red flag competition. During the construction of the Linxia to Xicang section of the Lanlang Highway, more than 1,500 peasants and herdsmen of all ethnic groups participated in the road construction work. They also created tools suitable for transporting soil on steep slopes, such as the "soil push-pull rake" and the "wire mesh earth basket" for carrying stones, as well as the "hybrid milling pickaxe" that could be used for both purposes. These tools greatly improved work efficiency and saved a lot of wealth for the country. In order to complete the road construction as soon as possible, peasants and herdsmen of all ethnic groups in various areas of the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Region organized hundreds of carts to transport timber for bridge construction to the construction site day and night. They also often transported fresh vegetables and fruits from dozens of li away to the construction site and sold them to the road construction workers at fair prices. The Weining-Shuicheng Highway in Guizhou Province is located in a high and cold mountainous area, but the Yi and Miao peasants who participated in the road construction remained enthusiastic. Laborer Liu Zhaoquan took the lead in going into the water with thin ice in the middle of winter to rush to repair the culvert. During the construction of the Huishui-Luodian Highway, workers of all ethnic groups, including Buyi and Miao, also launched labor competitions and rationalization proposal campaigns, creating and promoting advanced working methods such as wooden board carts, wooden skids for transporting stones, and iron plows for shoveling soil. According to statistics from Huiluo, Weishui, Jinping-Rongjiang and other roads alone, the peasants of Miao, Yi, Buyi, Hui and other ethnic groups contributed 1,142,206 workdays. Ethnic minority peasants in Gantian’ao, Bangeng and other places in Luodian County also voluntarily organized a road construction team of 200 people, led by members and team leaders of the farmers' association, to participate in road construction. Ethnic minority peasants in various districts and townships along the route who did not participate in road construction also voluntarily took time to make straw sandals and weave earth baskets to support road construction. When constructing the Wenchuan-Li County section of the Cheng'a (Chengdu to Aba) Highway, more than 6,000 peasants participated in the road construction work. The peasants in Xixigou also organized livestock to transport grain to the engineering team in Weizhou. The Qiang peasants in Taoping and Zhentouzhai also organized a comfort team, bringing banners, walnuts and cigarettes to the construction site to offer their condolences. Peasants in the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region also repaired the original roads and organized road maintenance teams while building highways. In the past year, the region repaired more than 78,000 square meters of road surface, and built and repaired a total of 66 bridges and culverts. Thanks to the establishment of the farmers' road maintenance teams, the roads often maintain a solid and flat roadbed.

    各族农民和牧民热烈支援公路建设
    各地修建公路中，都得到公路沿线各族农民和牧民的热烈支持和援助。
    康藏公路在修建时，沿线各地的藏民组织了上万头牦牛，把大批的物资送到工地。在运输中，藏民像爱护自己的东西一样爱护国家的物资。麻袋破了，他们就用自带的针线缝好。下雨落雪天，他们用自己的氆氇盖在物资上面。拉多宗（县）的喜饶生根完成了自己的运输任务后，又带着一千二百头牦牛越界到其他宗去运输。昌都地区各宗藏族人民更踊跃组织“藏族民工大队”，成百成千的藏民参加了修路。参加拉萨到太昭段筑路的藏民也都发挥了他们的劳动热情，使工作效率不断提高。许多从未使用过铁锹、钢镐的藏民，很快就学会了筑路技术，有一个小组创造了每日每人挑土五公方的新纪录，并出现了许多模范人物。在西康省藏族自治区境内修建驿道时，九龙县的彝民，自动参加修路。理塘县藏族民工为了赶早修好驿道，用牛粪烤化路面的冰冻，在一个月里，铺好路面二百多里。许多藏族妇女还自动为筑路员工磨?粑、烧茶。青藏公路沿线的藏民对修建公路表示极大的欢迎，他们自动为筑路的职工收集牦牛粪作燃料用，还组织了一支两千头牦牛的运输队。黄河木便桥在施工时，藏民们每天早上，从二十多里外的地方背来新鲜的牛奶和酥油给工人们吃，青海省整修同（仁）循（化）公路时，有五百多藏民参加，他们还开展了红旗竞赛。修筑兰郎公路临夏到西仓段的时候，有一千五百多名各族农民和牧民参加了修路工作，他们还创造了适合于陡坡运土的“土质推拉耙”、担运石块的
  “铁丝土箕”，可以两用的“混合式铣镐”等工具，这些工具使工作效率大大提高，为国家节省了不少财富。甘南藏族自治区各地各族农民和牧民为了早日把公路修好，组织了百辆大车，日以继夜地向工地运送修建桥梁的木材。他们还经常从数十里外的地方把新鲜的菜蔬、水果运到工地，以公平的价格卖给修路工人。贵州省的威（宁）水（城）公路位于高寒山区，但参加筑路的彝族、苗族农民，情绪始终饱满。民工刘昭全在严冬里，带头下到结有薄冰的水中，抢修涵洞。在惠（水）罗（甸）公路修筑中，布依、苗族等各族民工，还展开了劳动竞赛和合理化建议运动，创造和推广了木板推车、木棍滑板运石、铁犁铲土等先进工作方法。仅惠罗、威水、锦（屏）榕（江）等路统计，苗、彝、布依、回等族的农民就作了一百一十四万二千二百零六个工日。罗甸县干田坳、板庚等地的少数民族农民，还自动组织了二百人的筑路队，由农民协会委员、组长，领去参加筑路。沿线各区乡未参加筑路的少数民族农民，也自动抽空打草鞋、编土箕，支援修路。修筑成阿（成都至阿坝）公路的汶
  （川）理（县）段时，有六千多农民参加了筑路工作。谢溪沟的农民还组织牲口到威州给工程队运粮。桃坪、枕头寨羌族农民也组织慰问队带着锦旗、核桃和香烟到工地去慰问。湘西苗族自治区农民在兴修公路时，还整修了原有的公路，并组织了养路小组。一年来，全区整修公路路面有七万八千多平方公尺，新建和整修桥梁及涵洞共六十六座。由于农民养路小组的建立，各公路经常保持坚固平坦的路基。
