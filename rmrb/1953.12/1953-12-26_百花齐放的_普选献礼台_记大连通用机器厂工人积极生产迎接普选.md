    A Flowering "Gift Platform for the General Election"
    —Recording the Enthusiastic Production of Workers at Dalian General Machinery Factory in Preparation for the General Election

    Entering the Dalian General Machinery Factory, the most attractive thing is the solemnly and beautifully decorated "Gift Platform for the General Election." A portrait of Chairman Mao hangs high on the platform, and workers have decorated it with colorful ribbons and red flags around the leader's image. On both sides are large banners that read, "Actively participate in the general election and launch a production increase and economy campaign!" In the middle of the platform, a large red cloth announces the gifts offered by the workers of each workshop every day to celebrate the great general election movement—their glorious production achievements.

    The "Gift Platform for the General Election" at the Dalian General Machinery Factory was established on October 22nd. At that time, the factory had already announced the list of voters, and the workers had received their precious voter certificates. Everyone was very enthusiastic and put forward the slogan "Use our production achievements to give gifts to the general election." Since then, good news has been reported on the "Gift Platform for the General Election" every day. The workers who offered gifts felt very honored and proud. In front of the platform, the people offering gifts received warm congratulations from the representatives of the factory's Communist Party committee and the trade union.

    The first to offer gifts to the "Gift Platform for the General Election" were the outstanding workers from the machining workshop, Zhang Deliang, Guo Xunren, and An Bangxing. Guo Xunren, a worker from the fourth section of the machining workshop, in order to complete the drilling machine production task ahead of schedule and give a gift to the general election, found a trick through research. He changed to using a sharp knife to turn the inclined shaft seat, which reduced the production time of the inclined shaft seat from the original sixty minutes to eight minutes, increasing production efficiency by six and a half times. Zhang Deliang, a worker in the second section, improved the drill bit and operation method. In the past, the highest record for turning a drilling machine operating rod was eighty-five minutes, but now it only takes forty minutes. After offering the gift, Zhang Deliang said: "In this great general election movement, I deeply feel the unparalleled happiness that the Party and the country have brought us. We are the masters of the country, and in order to build our beloved motherland, I want to contribute my greatest strength!"

    Giving gifts to the general election was immediately regarded by the workers as the most glorious thing, and the workers in each workshop enthusiastically launched a "gift" competition. Seeing that everyone was giving gifts to the general election, Sha Xike and Pang Lianfu, workers in the machining workshop, became anxious. After discussing it, they decided to offer a gift to the general election with new achievements. When they went to work, the two of them carefully studied the production process of the worm wheel, changed the operating method, and scientifically divided the work and cooperated. As a result, they broke the highest record of milling six worm wheels per shift and reached twelve. When Yu Peijun and Wang Yongle, the milling machine workers on the next shift, saw this situation, they also wanted to offer a gift with a new record. As a result, they raised it again to a new record of milling thirteen worm wheels. Jiang Liye, a fifty-eight-year-old blacksmith in the canning workshop, also refused to lag behind. He created a tool for cutting iron rods and used an electric hammer to cut iron rods, which not only reduced physical labor and saved one worker, but also increased the efficiency of cutting rods eleven times. The old blacksmith was extremely happy. The next day, wearing a big red flower, he was surrounded by everyone to the "Gift Platform for the General Election" to offer his precious labor creation. The workers in the sand casting workshop decided that the focus of the gift-giving was to ensure product quality. They established a contract system and a four-check system including sand mold checking and wood mold checking. The workers in Chen Yuheng's group were the first to achieve results. They created the highest quality record in the workshop, reducing the defect rate from 3.06% to 0.59%. In this way, the gift platform for the general election was like a hundred flowers blooming, and the large red cloth in the middle of the platform was filled with the outstanding labor creations of the workers in each workshop.

    From October 22nd, when the "Gift Platform for the General Election" was established, to November 21st, the workers had offered 196 gifts. Wang Dejiang, a worker in the machining workshop, and Zhou Cheng, a worker in the sand casting workshop, etc., had created outstanding production achievements three or five times in a row. From October 22nd to 31st, in the ten days, the value of workers' over-production gifts alone reached more than 670 million yuan.

    百花齐放的“普选献礼台”
    ——记大连通用机器厂工人积极生产迎接普选
    新华社记者　李得天
    走进大连通用机器厂，最吸引人的就是布置得庄严美观的“普选献礼台”。献礼台上高挂着毛主席像，工人们在领袖像四周扎上彩绸，插满了红旗。两旁还写着“积极参加普选，开展增产节约竞赛！”等大字标语。献礼台中间的一幅大红布上，公布着该厂各车间工人每天为庆贺伟大的普选运动而献出的礼品——他们的辉煌的生产成就。
    大连通用机器厂的“普选献礼台”，是在十月二十二日建立的。那时工厂里已公布了选民名单，工人们领到了珍贵的选民证，大家情绪非常热烈，提出了“用自己的生产成绩来给普选献礼”的口号。自那时起，“普选献礼台”上就天天传着捷报。献礼的工人都感到十分光荣和自豪。在献礼台前，献礼的人都得到了厂里中共党委和工会代表热烈的祝贺。
    最先到“普选献礼台”献礼的是机械加工车间的优秀工人张德良、郭勋仁和安邦兴。机械加工车间第四工段工人郭勋仁，为了要提前完成钻探机生产任务给普选献礼，经过钻研找到了一个窍门，改用尖刀车斜轴座，这样就使车斜轴座的生产时间由原来的六十分钟缩短到八分钟，生产效率提高了六倍半。第二段工人张德良改进了钻头和操作方法，过去车一个钻探机操作杆最高纪录是八十五分钟，现在只需四十分钟就够了。张德良在献礼后说： “在这个伟大的普选运动中，我特别深切地体会到党和国家带给我们的无比幸福。我们是国家的主人翁，为了建设我们亲爱的祖国，我要贡献出我最大的力量！”
    给普选献礼立刻被工人们认为是最光荣的事，各车间的工人们热烈地展开了“献礼”的竞赛。加工车间工人沙锡科和庞连福看到大家都给普选献礼，心中着急起来，他们核计一下，决定也要以新成绩给普选献礼。上班时，他们两个人共同细心研究车蜗母轮的生产过程，改变了操作法，并且科学地分工合作，结果突破了一班铣六个蜗母轮的最高纪录，达到了十二个。下一班铣床工人于培俊和王永乐接班时看到这种情况，也要以新纪录献礼，结果他们又提高到铣十三个蜗母轮的新纪录。制罐车间五十八岁的老锻工蒋立业也不甘落后，他创造了一个切铁棍的胎具，并且利用电锤切铁棍，不仅减轻了体力劳动，节省了一个人工，还提高切棍效率十一倍。老锻工高兴极了，第二天他戴着大红花被大家拥到“普选献礼台”去献上了自己珍贵的劳动创造。翻砂车间工人们决定献礼的重点是保证产品质量，他们建立了包干制和查砂型、查木型等四查制度。陈玉恒组的工人首先做出了成绩，他们创造出废品率由百分之三点零六降低到百分之零点五九的车间质量最高纪录。这样，普选献礼台就好像百花齐放一样，台中间的大红布上写满了各车间工人优异的劳动创造。
    “普选献礼台”自十月二十二日建立以后，到十一月二十一日止，工人所献礼品已达一百九十六份。加工车间工人王德江和翻砂车间周成等都连续三次或五次创造了优异的生产成绩。自十月二十二日到三十一日十天中，单以工人超额生产献礼一项计算，价值即达六亿七千多万元。
