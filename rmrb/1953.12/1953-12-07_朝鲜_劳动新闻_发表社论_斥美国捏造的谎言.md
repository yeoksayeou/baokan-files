Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 6th. The "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial on the 6th entitled "The US Imperialists' Heinous Crimes Against Prisoners of War Can Never Be Erased," stating that the United States submitted a fabricated proposal at the United Nations General Assembly, slandering the so-called "atrocities" of the Korean and Chinese People's forces, and forcing the assembly to discuss it. The purpose of the United States is not difficult to understand. The purpose of the United States is to cover up its own heinous crimes against Korean civilians and our captured personnel, and to undermine a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue in order to maintain international tension. The editorial pointed out that the atrocities committed by the US aggressors against our captured personnel have long been regarded as heinous acts of hatred against humanity. People call Geoje Island "Island of Terror" or "Island of Death." The enemy prisoner-of-war camps formerly located in Yongcho Island, Bongam Island, Gwangju, Busan, and other places were all places where our captured personnel were massacred. All the facts are enough to prove how afraid the United States is of peace, how frantically it attempts to maintain international tension, and yet how afraid it is of the just sanctions of the people of the world.

The editorial emphasized that the heinous crimes of the American executioners against our captured personnel and the Korean people cannot be concealed by any trickery, nor can they ever be washed away. Their frantic struggle will only further expose their ugly faces, and there will be no other result.

    朝鲜“劳动新闻”发表社论
    斥美国捏造的谎言
    【新华社平壤六日电】“劳动新闻”六日以“美帝国主义对战俘的罪恶暴行是永远洗刷不掉的”为题发表社论说：美国在联合国大会上提出捏造朝中人民部队的所谓“暴行”的诬蔑的提案，并强迫大会加以讨论的目的是不难理解的。美国的目的，就在于掩饰它自己对朝鲜平民和我方被俘人员的罪恶暴行，破坏朝鲜问题和平解决，以保持国际紧张局势。社论指出：美国侵略者对我方被俘人员进行的暴行，早已被人们认为是仇恨人类的罪恶行为。人们把巨济岛称为“恐怖之岛”或“死亡之岛”。过去设在龙草岛、蜂岩岛、光州、釜山等地的敌方战俘营，都是屠杀我方被俘人员的场所。一切事实都足以证明美方多么害怕和平，多么疯狂地企图保持国际紧张局势，然而它又多么惧怕世界人民的正义制裁。
    社论强调说：美国刽子手对我方被俘人员和朝鲜人民的罪恶暴行，是任何伎俩所掩饰不了的，也是永远洗不清的。他们的疯狂挣扎除了更加暴露他们的丑恶面目以外，是别无其他结果的。
