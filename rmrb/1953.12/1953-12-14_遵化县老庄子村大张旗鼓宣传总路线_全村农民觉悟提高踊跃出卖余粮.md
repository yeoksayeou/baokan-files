Lao Zhuangzi Village, Zunhua County, Vigorously Promotes the General Line; Village Peasants' Awareness Increases, Enthusiastically Selling Surplus Grain

The Zunhua County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government work team, in coordination with the grain purchase work in Lao Zhuangzi Village, vigorously and thoroughly promoted the general line of the state during the transition period. This not only basically completed the task of grain acquisition but also raised the political awareness of party members and peasants, greatly enhanced the socialist atmosphere in the countryside, promoted the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and created favorable conditions for the future development of agricultural production.

On November 8th, when the Zunhua County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held an enlarged meeting of the county committee, it absorbed the secretary of the Lao Zhuangzi Village Party branch, the village head, and the secretary of the Youth League branch to participate. After listening to the transmission report on the general line of the state during the transition period and the state's grain purchase policy, their ideological awareness was greatly improved. On November 10th, Zhu Hua, the county head of Zunhua County, led a work team to Lao Zhuangzi Village to conduct a typical experiment in promoting the general line of the state during the transition period.

After the work team arrived in the village, it first convened a meeting of Communist Party members, Youth League members, and activists to convey the general line of the state during the transition period, while simultaneously arranging and deploying production work. At the group discussion meeting, the work team, in connection with the actual situation in the village, guided party members, Youth League members, and activists to recall and compare the production and living conditions before and after liberation. This enabled everyone to recognize that the village's land yield had doubled and the peasants' lives had gradually improved over the past few years as a result of the Communist Party's leadership, the development of mutual aid and cooperation, and the improvement of farming techniques. At the same time, through analyzing that fertilizer powder, new-style plows, and "666" powder were all produced in factories, everyone recognized that peasants could get more benefits from national industrialization. To support national industrialization, peasants should actively sell their surplus grain to the state. After repeated discussion and comparison, an atmosphere of love for the Communist Party and love for socialism was created; many non-Party cadres requested to join the Party and began to deliberate on organizing agricultural production cooperatives.

On this basis, the work team reported the state's policy on grain acquisition and, in conjunction with the actual situation in the village, guided everyone to calculate and compare accounts, eliminating the ideological concerns of a few people who feared low state grain prices. Many people recalled the suffering of being exploited by unscrupulous merchants in the past, compared grain-speculating merchants to "little mice," and unanimously expressed that they would sell their surplus grain to the state. Then, the work team called on cadres and activists to self-report their surplus grain and set grain sales plans. Because the ideological education work was sufficient, the grain sales plans set by cadres and activists were generally in line with the actual situation. The work team also specifically helped agricultural labor model Ma Xiangong set a grain sales plan. When setting the plan, Ma Xiangong said: "Who doesn't know that in the past, I had food on the pot but nothing under it. If it weren't for Chairman Mao's leadership, there wouldn't be today. My family of nine people will keep 13 shi of grain this year, plus dried sweet potatoes from one mu of land, which is enough to eat. I will sell all 22 shi of surplus grain to the state. I also have one shi of stored wheat that I will sell to the state."

After holding a good meeting of Party members, Youth League members, and activists, the work team launched publicity and education among the masses of the whole village. First, Zhu Hua reported on the general line of the state during the transition period at a mass meeting. After discussion by the masses, he reported on the state's grain acquisition policy. Immediately afterward, twenty-seven activists adopted a variety of methods such as division of labor by area, informal talks, kang-head meetings, and family meetings to carry out publicity work.

In group discussions, the peasants warmly supported the general line. Under the guidance of the cadres, the peasants recalled their lives before and after the land reform. Many people said happily: "Life is getting better year by year under the leadership of Chairman Mao. In socialist society, our lives will be even better!" After comparing the production situation of organized and individual farming, the peasants deeply appreciated the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups. When discussing selling surplus grain to the state, some peasants felt it was "disgraceful" to be a surplus grain household, while others feared rising prices and that paper money would not hold its value. The work team promptly grasped the different ideological situations of different people. On the one hand, it educated village cadres and used them to carry out persuasion and explanation work; on the other hand, in response to the masses' ideological concerns, it prominently pointed out that it was glorious to have surplus grain through labor production, and even more glorious to sell surplus grain to the state to support construction; laziness was not glorious and should continue to be transformed, and being a loafer was hopeless. It also exposed the behavior of grain speculators engaging in speculation and disrupting the market, harming the people, and explained the benefits of state grain acquisition for national construction and for peasants. After repeated positive education, the masses understood that the Party and the People's Government's attitude towards surplus grain households and towards loafers was obviously different and therefore strongly supported the Party's policy. After recalling and comparing, the masses were extremely resentful of the disruptive behavior of grain speculators. They said: "If grain prices rise, the prices of industrial products will also have to rise. In addition to eating grain, ordinary people also need industrial products. If prices rise, the ones who suffer are still the ordinary people, and the ones who benefit are the speculators!" They unanimously agreed that "grain must be managed by the state." On the basis of the masses' increased awareness, mass meetings were held in different areas, calling on the masses to set grain sales plans. At the meeting, the grain sales plan of labor model Ma Xiangong was announced, and cadres and activists took the lead in self-reporting, setting an example for the masses. Thus, a wave of "selling patriotic grain" gradually formed. The whole village sold a total of more than 68,000 jin of surplus grain, and together with the more than 20,000 jin already sold, a total of more than 89,000 jin. After the self-reporting was completed, the masses actively transported grain to the warehouse. When delivering grain, the masses excitedly inserted red flags with the words "Selling Patriotic Grain" on the grain carts.

After half a month of publicity and education, the political awareness of the masses was raised and the enthusiasm for production increased. Under the promotion of the work team, the peasants of the whole village carried out autumn plowing on more than 1,000 mu of land that had not yet been cultivated, and set plans for winter production, manure accumulation, and transforming 100 mu of soil. Twelve households also voluntarily requested to organize agricultural production cooperatives. After selling the grain, the masses requested that the money be invested in production and asked to buy 8,000 jin of fertilizer powder. The work team, based on the current situation of insufficient fertilizer powder supply in the local area, carried out education on accumulating more coarse manure and not just waiting for fertilizer powder. In order to help the masses save the remaining money after selling the grain in a timely manner, so as to invest in production in a planned manner next spring, the work team promoted the method of depositing grain sales proceeds and the state giving preferential interest. The masses happily said, "Storing grain breeds insects, depositing money breeds interest," and they all set savings plans. According to preliminary calculations, 50% of the grain sales proceeds of the whole village are planned to be deposited in the bank. Labor model Ma Xiangong took the lead in depositing 2 million yuan from selling grain into the state bank. In addition, after five activists improved their awareness, they voluntarily applied to join the Party. Through the general line propaganda work, all kinds of work in Lao Zhuangzi Village have been greatly advanced.

    遵化县老庄子村大张旗鼓宣传总路线
    全村农民觉悟提高踊跃出卖余粮
    中共河北省遵化县县委会和人民政府工作组在老庄子村配合购粮工作，大张旗鼓地深入宣传了国家过渡时期的总路线，不但基本上完成了收购粮食的任务，还提高了党员和农民的政治觉悟，使农村社会主义空气大为高涨，促进了互助合作运动的开展，为今后发展农业生产创造了有利条件。
    十一月八日，中共遵化县委会召开县委扩大会议时，即曾吸收老庄子村党支部书记、村长和青年团支部书记参加。他们听了国家过渡时期总路线和国家收购粮食政策的传达报告以后，思想觉悟大为提高。十一月十日，遵化县县长祝华带领工作组，到老庄子村进行宣传国家过渡时期总路线的典型试验。
    工作组到村后，首先召开了共产党员、青年团员和积极分子会议，传达了国家过渡时期的总路线，同时安排和布置了生产工作。在分组讨论会上，工作组联系该村实际情况，引导党员、团员和积极分子回忆对比解放前后生产和生活情况，使大家认识到解放几年来该村土地产量提高一倍，农民生活逐步得到改善，是共产党领导的结果，是发展互助合作的结果，也是改进耕作技术的结果。同时，通过分析肥田粉、新式步犁、“六六六”粉都是工厂里生产的，大家认识到国家工业化了农民才能得到更多的好处，为了支持国家工业化，农民应该积极把余粮卖给国家。经过反复讨论对比，造成了热爱共产党和热爱社会主义的空气；许多非党干部要求入党，并开始酝酿组织农业生产合作社。
    在这一基础上，工作组报告了国家收购粮食的政策，并结合本村实际情况引导大家算账对比，消除了少数人怕国家粮价低等思想顾虑。许多人回忆了过去受奸商剥削的苦后，把粮食投机奸商比作“小老鼠”，一致表示要把余粮卖给国家。然后，工作组即在干部、积极分子中号召自报余粮，订售粮计划。由于思想教育工作充分，干部、积极分子订的售粮计划一般都能切合实际情况。工作组还具体帮助农业劳动模范马显功订了售粮计划。马显功在订计划时说：“谁不知道我在过去有锅上的，就没有锅下的。不是毛主席领导，那有今天，我家大小九口人，今年我留十三石粮食，还有一亩地的白薯干，就够吃了，把二十二石余粮全都卖给国家。我还有陈麦子一石，也要卖给国家。”
    开好党员、团员和积极分子会议以后，工作组向全村群众展开宣传教育。首先，由祝华在群众大会上报告了国家过渡时期的总路线，经群众讨论以后，他又报告了国家收购粮食的政策。紧接着，由二十七个积极分子采取分片分工、漫谈、开炕头会、开家庭会等多种多样的方式进行了宣传工作。
    农民在分组讨论中，对总路线热烈拥护。农民们在干部引导下，回忆了土地改革前后的生活，许多人高兴地说：“在毛主席领导下生活一年比一年好了，到社会主义社会，我们的生活就更好！”经过对比组织起来和单干的生产情况，农民们深切体会到农业生产合作社和互助组的优越性。在讨论把余粮卖给国家的时候，有的农民觉得当余粮户“不光彩”，有的怕物价上涨，怕票子存不住。工作组及时掌握了不同人的不同思想情况，一方面在村干部中进行教育，通过他们进行说服解释工作；一方面针对群众的思想顾虑，突出地提出劳动生产有余粮是光荣的，把余粮卖给国家支援建设更光荣；懒汉不光荣，还要继续改造，当二流子是没有出息的；缺粮户应积极生产，争取多打粮食。同时揭发了粮食奸商投机倒把扰乱市场危害人民的行为，说明了国家收购粮食对国家建设和对农民的好处。经过正面的反复教育，群众了解到党和人民政府对待余粮户的态度和对待二流子的态度显然不同，便十分拥护党的政策。经过回忆对比，群众对粮食奸商的捣乱行为异常痛恨。他们说：“粮价涨，工业品也得涨。老百姓除了吃粮食，还要用工业品。物价涨了，吃亏的还是老百姓，沾光的是奸商！”一致认为“粮食非国家管起来不可”。在群众觉悟提高的基础上，分片召开群众会议，号召群众订售粮计划。在会议上公布了劳动模范马显功的售粮计划，干部和积极分子首先自报，为群众树立了榜样。于是群众普遍开家庭会订售粮计划。对于计划符合实际情况的，及时通过黑板报、广播进行表扬，这样就逐步形成了“卖光荣粮”的热潮。全村共卖出余粮六万八千余斤，连前已卖出的两万余斤，共八万九千余斤。自报结束后，群众积极运粮入库。在送粮时，群众还兴奋地在运粮车上插上“售光荣粮”的红旗。
    经过半个月的宣传教育，群众政治觉悟提高，生产情绪上涨。全村农民在工作组推动下，把一千多亩还没有耕的地进行了秋耕，订了冬季生产、积肥和改造土壤一百亩等项计划，还有十二户自动要求组织农业生产合作社。群众卖粮后，要求将款投入生产，要求买八千斤肥田粉，工作组根据目前当地肥田粉供应不足的情况，进行了多积粗肥、不能单等肥田粉的教育。为了及时帮助群众把售粮后的余款储蓄起来，以便明春有计划地投入生产，工作组宣传了售粮存款，国家给优厚利息的办法。群众高兴地说：“存粮生虫，存款生利”，纷纷订出储蓄计划。初步计算，全村百分之五十的售粮款都计划存入银行。劳动模范马显功把卖粮得到的款，拿出二百万元带头存入了国家银行。另外有五个积极分子觉悟提高后，自动申请入党。通过总路线宣传工作，老庄子村各种工作都大大地向前推进了一步。
