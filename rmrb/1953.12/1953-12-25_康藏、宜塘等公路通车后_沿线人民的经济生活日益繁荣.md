    After the opening of the Kangzang, Yitang, and Huiluo highways, the exchange of goods between remote areas and the interior has been greatly promoted, and the economic life of the people in remote areas has become increasingly prosperous.
    Changdu is the economic center of western Xikang. Trade between the mainland and Tibet is conducted here. The surrounding areas produce about six million pounds of wool and a large amount of Chinese medicinal materials, animal skins and other local products every year. However, before liberation, due to inconvenient transportation, these local products could not be transported out, and the tea and cloth needed by the Tibetan people could not be transported in. After the opening of the Kangzang Highway, the people north of Changdu immediately transported 80,000 to 90,000 pounds of wool that had been accumulated for many years to Changdu. The state-owned trading company's 100,000 packages of tea, silk, hada, etc. were also continuously transported along the highway. The trading company also organized ten trade groups to go to agricultural and pastoral areas, and through cooperatives, delivered a large number of daily necessities to farmers and herdsmen.
    After the Yibin-Junlian section of the Sichuan Yitang Highway opened to traffic in July this year, it transported all the unsold paper and tea from Yibin, grain from Gao County, and tung oil, hemp, gallnuts, and silk from Junlian, and the goods and salt needed by the local people could also be transported from other places, and the freight was very low. In the past, manual transportation cost more than 1.2 million yuan per ton of goods, but now it only costs 268,800 yuan.
    In the past, Luodian County, Guizhou Province, was closed to traffic. The tung oil, green hemp, cowhide, cotton, wood, vegetables, and fruits produced in the county had to be transported to Guiyang and other places by human or animal power. The salt, cloth, and daily necessities needed by the local people were scarce and expensive. After the opening of the highway from Huishui to Luodian, a large number of salt and general merchandise were immediately transported in, and the tung oil, green hemp, and wood that could not be sold in the past could also be transported out in large quantities. Recently, the prices of salt in Luodian and Huishui have begun to fall due to the reduction in freight. After the newly built Sinan-Tongren Road connected the Wujiang River and the Sichuan-Guizhou Highway, a large amount of grain that could not be transported out of Jiangkou area in Guizhou in the past is now being transported out.
    Before liberation, there were no formal highways in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and all transportation relied on camels. After liberation, road construction began, and now 2,593 kilometers of highways have been opened to traffic. The development of transportation has played a significant role in the exchange of goods between Inner Mongolia and the mainland. For example, after the Xilingol League Transportation Company was established on June 1, 1952, it transported more than 800,000 catties of wool that had been backlogged in Xilinhot (the seat of the People's Government of Xilingol League) for several years, and transported in a large number of industrial products. In order to meet the needs of the local people, state-owned trading companies and cooperatives also went deep into various pastoral areas to purchase animal products and supply industrial products. Before liberation, foreign merchants would bring a small amount of brick tea, cigarettes, and cloth to the pastoral areas, and exchange them for a large amount of wool and sheepskin from the herdsmen, from which they would make huge profits. But now herdsmen can sell their animal products to state-owned trading companies and cooperatives at reasonable prices, and buy back industrial products with high quality and low prices. In the past, many herdsmen could not afford cloth clothes, and they used to cover themselves with old sheepskins, but now they can wear cotton clothes of good quality or sheepskin jackets with cloth surfaces, and many women are wearing silk headscarves.

### 康藏、宜塘等公路通车后  沿线人民的经济生活日益繁荣

    康藏、宜塘等公路通车后
    沿线人民的经济生活日益繁荣
    康藏、宜塘、惠罗等公路通车后，大大促进了边远地区和内地的物资交流，繁荣了边远地区人民的经济生活。
    昌都是西康西部的经济中心，内地和西藏间的贸易都在这里进行，它周围的地区每年出产六百万磅左右的羊毛和大宗药材、兽皮等土特产，但解放前因交通不便，这些土产都运不出来，而藏民需要的茶和布又运不进去。康藏公路通车后，昌都以北的人民，马上就把积存了多年的八、九万磅羊毛运到昌都，国营贸易公司的十万包茶叶和绸子、哈达等也沿着公路源源不断地运去。贸易公司还组织了十个贸易组到农牧区，通过合作社，把大量生活日用品送到农牧民手里。
    四川宜塘公路宜（宾）筠（连）段于今年七月通车后，把过去销不出去的宜宾的纸、茶叶，高县的粮食，筠连的桐油、大麻、棓子、蚕丝等统统运了出去，本地人民需要的百货、食盐等也都能由外地运来，并且运费很低，以前使用人力运输每吨货需一百二十余万元的运费，现在仅需二十六万八千八百元。
    贵州罗甸县过去交通闭塞，该县盛产的桐油、青麻、牛皮、棉花、木材及蔬菜、水果要靠人背或兽驮，才能运到贵阳等地去。当地人民需要的食盐、布匹和日用百货又少又贵。惠水到罗甸的公路通车后，立刻就运来了大批的食盐和百货，以前销不掉的桐油、青麻和木材也能大量运出，最近罗甸和惠水的食盐价格，因运费减少已开始降低了。新建的思（南）铜（仁）路把乌江和川黔公路连接起来后，贵州江口一带过去无法运出的大批粮食现都运了出去。
    内蒙古自治区，解放前没有一条正式公路，一切运输都靠骆驼。解放后，开始筑路，到现在已有二五九三公里公路通车。交通运输事业的发展，对内蒙与内地的物资交流起了很大的作用。例如锡察盟运输公司于一九五二年六月一日成立后已将锡林浩特（锡林郭勒盟人民政府所在地）积压了数年的八十多万斤羊毛运了出来，并运入了大批的工业品。国营贸易公司和合作社为了满足当地人民的需要，还深入到各个牧业区收购畜产品，供应工业品。解放前，外地商人带着少量的砖茶、香烟、布匹到牧业区去，就可向牧民换取大量的羊毛、羊皮，从中获取暴利。但现在牧民可按合理的价格将畜产品卖给国营贸易公司和合作社，买回物美价廉的工业品。过去许多牧民穿不上布衣，他们一向用老羊皮遮身，而现在他们都能穿上质料很好的棉衣或配有布面的羊皮袄，许多妇女都围上了丝质的头巾。
