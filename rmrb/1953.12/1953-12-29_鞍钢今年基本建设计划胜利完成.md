Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, December 28th: The Anshan Iron and Steel Company has victoriously completed its 1953 basic construction plan (total annual workload) eleven days ahead of schedule. This marks a major victory in China's heavy industry construction.

By December 20th, Anshan Iron and Steel had completed more than 100% of its total annual basic construction workload, with construction and installation engineering completing 101.8%; geological prospecting engineering completed the annual plan as early as December 11th. This year's basic construction project totals thirty items, of which the three major projects—the large rolling mill, the seamless steel tube plant, and the No. 7 blast furnace—have been completed and put into production successively. The building and installation plans for the main projects still under construction, the new thin plate plant and the renovation of the first primary rolling mill, have been completed more than 104%. In addition, the renovation of blast furnaces and other projects in the 1954 engineering plan also began construction earlier this year.

The scale of Anshan Iron and Steel's basic construction this year is very large. The completed construction volume is equal to 184% of the construction volume in 1952; the completed installation volume is equal to 221% of the installation volume in 1952. At the same time, various major projects are very complex and are new or renovated for the first time in China. Therefore, the fact that these projects can be completed ahead of schedule shows that the speed of China's heavy industry construction is very fast.

The early completion of the basic construction plan by Anshan Iron and Steel, especially the commissioning of certain major projects, will greatly increase the output of iron and steel. Just the steel production capacity, after the main projects are put into production this year, will increase by about one-half compared to the past.

    鞍钢今年基本建设计划胜利完成
   【新华社鞍山二十八日电】鞍山钢铁公司已提前十一天胜利完成了一九五三年基本建设计划（全年工作总量）。这标志着我国重工业建设的重大胜利。
    到十二月二十日止，鞍钢全年的基本建设工作总量已完成百分之一百以上，其中建筑和安装工程完成了百分之一百零一点八；地质勘察工程在十二月十一日就完成了全年计划。今年基本建设工程共三十项，其中的三大工程——大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂和第七号炼铁炉，已先后竣工投入生产；仍在施工中的主要工程新建薄板厂、改建第一初轧厂的建筑安装计划，已完成百分之一百零四以上。此外，一九五四年工程计划中改建炼铁炉等工程，也提前于今年内开始施工。
    鞍钢今年基本建设的规模很大，已完成的建筑工程量，等于一九五二年建筑工程量的百分之一百八十四；已完成的安装工程量，等于一九五二年安装工程量的百分之二百二十一。同时，各项主要工程非常复杂，又都是我国初次新建或改建的。因此，这些工程能够提前完成计划，说明了我国进行重工业建设的速度是很快的。
    鞍钢提前完成基本建设计划，特别是某些主要工程的投入生产，将使钢铁和钢材的产量大大提高。只是钢材的生产能力，今年主要工程投入生产后，将比过去提高二分之一左右。
