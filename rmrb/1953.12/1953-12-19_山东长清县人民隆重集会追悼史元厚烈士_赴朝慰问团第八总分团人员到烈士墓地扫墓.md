The people of Changqing County, Shandong Province, held a solemn gathering of more than 5,000 representatives from all walks of life on the 14th to mourn Martyr Shi Yuanhou, a Luo Shengjiao-style internationalist fighter, a model of love for the people of the Chinese People's Volunteers, a first-class meritorious hero, and a model member of the Youth League, who gloriously sacrificed his life while saving Korean children.

The memorial meeting was held in the square in front of Panjia Village, Seventh District, Changqing County, the hometown of Martyr Shi Yuanhou. In the center of the memorial shed built with plain cloth, the spiritual tablet and portrait of Martyr Shi Yuanhou were placed, and the offering table was filled with sacrifices. The memorial shed was surrounded by elegiac couplets and wreaths sent by the Shandong Branch of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Shandong Provincial People's Government, the Shandong Branch of the Resist-US and Aid-Korea Association, the Shandong Provincial People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee, the Shandong Military Region Command and Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, the Jinan Railway Administration, the Changqing County Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the Changqing County People's Government, and other organizations. The father and mother of Martyr Shi Yuanhou, who was nearly sixty years old, and the nineteen-year-old younger brother of Martyr Shi Yuanhou, stood guard in front of the martyr's spiritual tablet. People wearing white flowers silently came to the venue from all directions to participate in the memorial.

At the beginning of the memorial meeting, Li Cheng, a member of the Shandong Provincial People's Government, vice chairman of the Shandong Provincial People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee, and secretary-general of the Shandong Branch of the Resist-US and Aid-Korea Association, presided over the ceremony. After presenting a wreath to the martyr's portrait, he said: "It is an honor for the people of the whole province to have such an immortal internationalist fighter in our province. Martyr Shi Yuanhou's heroic actions not only further strengthened the close friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples, but will also greatly encourage the Chinese people to continue to deepen the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea." Li Cheng called on the people of the province to actively learn from Martyr Shi Yuanhou's spirit of patriotism and internationalism, to strive to actively implement the general line of the country during the transition period, and to strive for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Jiang Kui, representative of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, said in his eulogy: We, the Youth League members and the vast number of young people in the province, must take Martyr Shi as our example and actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland. Chen Tao, the county magistrate of Changqing County People's Government, called on the 550,000 farmers and other people from all walks of life in the county to support national construction and the struggle of the Chinese and Korean people's forces to defend peace in the Far East and the world by increasing production, improving mutual assistance and cooperation, and selling all surplus grain to the state.

Shi Guangcheng, the father of Martyr Shi Yuanhou, also spoke at the meeting. He said: "It is an honor for Yuanhou to sacrifice himself to save Korean children. I will also do my part for the construction of the motherland under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the People's Government." At the meeting, representatives from various agencies and organizations in Changqing County also spoke one after another. Shi Shengtang, a comrade-in-arms of Martyr Shi Yuanhou and working in the Public Security Department of the Shanghai Railway Administration, introduced the martyr's life deeds at the meeting.
