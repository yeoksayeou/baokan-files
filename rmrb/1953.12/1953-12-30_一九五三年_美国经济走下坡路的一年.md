    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The year 1953 marked the definite transition of the American economy from an artificially created war "boom" into a recession.
    In this year, American monopoly capitalists, through their representatives in Washington, continued to pursue a policy of economic militarization. The federal government's expenditures in the first three quarters of this year were more than six billion dollars per month. This large sum of money, mostly in the form of military orders, further fueled the abnormal development of the economy, maintained a high level of corporate activity, and provided monopoly capitalists with maximum profits. According to estimates by American bourgeois newspapers, American companies' after-tax profits in 1953 exceeded 20 billion dollars, an increase of 11 percent over 1952.
    However, this process of economic militarization brought endless disasters to the American working people. Along with the increase in government spending, the tax burden on American taxpayers has risen to the highest peak since the founding of the United States. Coupled with the continuous rise in living expenses, this has made the American people even poorer this year.
    Even according to official figures, it is not difficult to see that this year, the income of the American people has been declining continuously. Figures published by the Department of Commerce show that in 1950, the proportion of Americans' after-tax so-called "personal disposable income" in the national income was 85 percent. By the first quarter of this year, it had fallen to 80 percent, and by mid-year, it had fallen further to 79 percent. Since the pincers of taxes and prices mainly target the working people, the deterioration of the actual situation of the urban and rural workers who constitute the vast majority of the American population is far worse than what this figure shows. Since the second half of the year, due to the increase in the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed, and the continued high cost of living, the actual income of the working people has been further reduced. The result of the reduction in the actual income of the broad masses of working people is the relative shrinking of the domestic consumer market. Figures from the same Department of Commerce show that in the middle of this year, the proportion of national personal consumption expenditure in the national gross product had fallen from 67 percent in 1950 to 61 percent.
    However, insufficient people's consumption is only one aspect of the problem. The particularly serious crisis factors contained in the American economy today lie in its over-expansion of production. Official figures show that the U.S. national gross product reached its peak in the middle of this year. Compared with 1948, the total value of national goods and services produced increased by about 40 percent. But during this period, U.S. social consumption only increased by more than 20 percent. This means that in recent years, due to the stimulation of the Korean War, the expansion of production has greatly exceeded the development of normal social consumption. This makes the problem of overproduction more acute. At the end of 1948, due to the contradiction between the blind expansion of production and the insufficiency of people's consumption, the American economy had already experienced a crisis of overproduction, and production fell by about 17 percent in less than a year.
    Although government procurement and capitalist investment to adapt to militarized development are unprecedentedly large this year, they cannot make up for the widening gap between production and civilian consumption. As a result, the amount of inventory backlog in enterprises is unprecedentedly huge. In early October of this year, commercial and industrial inventories reached more than 79.3 billion U.S. dollars, an increase of about 4.7 billion U.S. dollars compared with the beginning of this year. The departments with the largest increase in inventory are precisely the originally so-called "prosperous" manufacturing industries, especially the so-called durable goods departments (machines, automobiles, televisions, etc.)
    The American bourgeois newspapers once boasted that although corporate inventories were increasing, corporate sales were also increasing, so the increase in inventories was not terrible. This statement has been refuted by the reality of American economic development. Since autumn, the peak retail season has not been prosperous. The business that merchants had been wholeheartedly hoping for during the December Christmas season did not flourish as expected. An Associated Press dispatch on the 22nd said that American merchants felt "puzzled" by consumers "delaying" their Christmas purchases this year; and according to some merchants, "the American people simply don't have more money to spend."
    According to the figures in the American bourgeois newspapers, the phenomena of declining production and insufficient enterprise operation have become increasingly obvious in the second half of this year. The national gross product reached its peak in the second quarter of this year, and fell by 3.4 billion U.S. dollars in the third quarter. Total industrial production in November had fallen by more than 6 percent compared with March of this year. The decline in production is particularly serious in heavy industry, and the production of so-called "durable goods" has fallen by 9 percent. By the beginning of this month, steel production had decreased by 11.1 percent compared with the peak after the Korean War, automobile production had decreased by 11.5 percent, machine production had decreased by 4.9 percent, and textile production had decreased by 20.3 percent. At the same time, many industries have fallen into a state of serious undercapacity. For example, about one-third of the national foundry factories are not operating on average. Many factories now only work three or four days a week. Some manufacturing companies that are not considered small have simply stopped production.
    Under these circumstances, the number of unemployed people has increased significantly. According to an official U.S. survey in November, the number of employed people is constantly decreasing in major cities such as Buffalo, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and San Francisco. "U.S. News & World Report" magazine admitted that with the decline in industry and commerce, the number of registered unemployed people increased by 10 percent in September compared with the same period last year, 28 percent in October, and 50 percent in November. According to materials published by the Department of Commerce, in November of this year, the number of employees in all U.S. factories decreased by 4 percent compared with the beginning of summer. The average working hours of employed workers has dropped to the lowest level for November working hours in the past four years.
    What is even more noteworthy is the trend of declining corporate investment, which reflects the real anxiety about the future hidden behind the capitalists' feigned calmness. In the fourth quarter of this year, total corporate investment has decreased by 500 million U.S. dollars compared with the peak in the third quarter of this year. Investment is expected to decrease further next year.
    In addition, due to the deterioration of the economic situation, corporate orders, railway freight volume, and export trade volume are all decreasing sharply. And the long-delayed agricultural crisis is deepening. Therefore, at the end of this year's outlook, an important topic discussed by American bourgeois newspapers is what stage the so-called "adjustment" that has begun in the American economy will develop to.

    一九五三年——美国经济走下坡路的一年
    据新华社讯：一九五三年，是美国经济从人工制造的战争“繁荣”确定地转入衰退的一年。
    在这一年里，美国垄断资本通过他们派在华盛顿的代表，继续推行经济军事化的政策。联邦政府的开支在今年头三季每月在六十亿美元以上，这一大笔开支绝大部分以军事订货的形式，进一步助长经济的畸形发展，维持企业活动的高度水平，为垄断资本家提供了最大的利润。据美国资产阶级报刊估计，在一九五三年，美国公司纳税后的利润在二百亿美元以上，比一九五二年多百分之十一。
    但是经济上的这种军事化过程却给美国劳动人民带来了无穷的灾难。与政府开支增加同时，美国纳税人的捐税负担已上升到美国开国以来的最高峰，再加上生活费用的连续上涨，就使得美国人民今年更加陷入贫困的境地。
    即使根据官方数字也不难看出，今年，美国人民的收入在不断下降。商务部发表的数字说明，在一九五零年，美国人纳税后的所谓“个人可支配收入”在全国国民收入中的比重为百分之八十五，到了今年第一季降至百分之八十，到年中再降至百分之七十九。由于捐税与物价的夹钳主要是针对劳动人民，因此占美国人口绝大多数的城乡劳动者的实际情况的恶化，远较这一数字所显示的为甚。下半年以来，由于失业和半失业人数增加，生活费用继续高涨，劳动人民的实际收入进一步缩减。广大劳动人民实际收入减少的结果，就是国内消费市场的相对缩小。同一个商务部的数字说明，在今年年中，全国范围的个人消费开支在全国国民生产总值中的比重，已从一九五零年的百分之六十七降至百分之六十一。
    但是人民消费不足只是问题的一方面，美国经济今天包藏着的特别严重的危机因素，还在它的生产的过度膨胀。官方的数字说明，美国全国国民生产在今年年中达到了最高峰，与一九四八年比较，全国货物与劳务的生产总值约增加了百分之四十多。但在这一期间内，美国社会消费只增加百分之二十多。这就是说，这几年来，由于朝鲜战争的刺激，生产的扩充大大地超过了正常社会消费的发展。这就使得生产过剩的问题具有了更尖锐的性质。在一九四八年临末的时候，由于生产盲目扩张与人民消费的不足之间的矛盾，美国经济已经爆发过一次生产过剩的危机，生产在不到一年的时间内下降了约百分之十七。
    尽管今年政府的采购和资本家为适应军事化发展的投资数额空前庞大，却弥补不了生产与民用消费之间日益扩大的差额。因此企业积压的存货数量空前巨大。在今年十月初，工商业的存货达七百九十三亿余美元，比今年年初增加了约四十七亿美元。存货增加最多的部门恰恰是原来所谓“繁荣”的制造业，其中尤以所谓耐用品部门（机器、汽车、电视器等等）最为严重。
    美国资产阶级报刊曾经吹嘘，企业存货虽然增加，但是企业销售量也在增加，因而存货的增加并不可怕。这种说法已受到美国经济发展的现实的驳斥。入秋以来，零售业旺季不旺。商人们所一心指望的十二月份圣诞节期的生意，也并没有像预期那样兴隆。美联社二十二日发出的一则消息说，美国商人对于今年消费者“迟迟不开始”他们圣诞节的采购感到“疑惑”；而据一些商人解释，“美国人民根本就没有更多的钱来花了。”
    根据美国资产阶级报刊的数字，生产下降和企业开工不足的现象在今年下半年是愈来愈明显了。全国国民生产总值在今年第二季达到最高峰，到第三季就下跌了三十四亿美元。工业总生产到十一月已比今年三月下降了百分之六以上。生产下降在重工业中特别严重，所谓“耐用品”的生产下降了百分之九。到本月月初，钢铁生产比朝鲜战争后的高峰减少了百分之十一·一，汽车生产减少了百分之十一·五，机器生产减少了百分之四·九，纺织品的生产减少了百分之二十·三。同时，许多工业都陷入严重开工不足的状态。例如全国翻砂工厂平均约有三分之一没有开工。许多工厂现在每周只工作三天或四天。有一些并不算小的制造公司，干脆停止了生产。
    在这种情况下，失业人数便大量增加起来。根据美国官方十一月份的一个调查，在布法罗、克利夫兰、匹兹堡以及旧金山等等大城市，就业人数正在不断减少。“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志承认，在工商业倒退的情况下，登记失业的人数和一年前同期相比，在九月份增加了百分之十，在十月份增加了百分之二十八，在十一月份增加了百分之五十。根据商务部公布的材料，在今年十一月份，美国所有工厂的就业人数较夏初减少了百分之四。而在业工人的平均工作时数已降至四年来十一月份工作时数的最低水平。
    更值得注意的是企业投资减少的趋势，这反映了资本家的故作镇静的腔调背后隐伏着的对前途的真正忧虑。在今年第四季，全部企业投资已比今年第三季的高峰减少了五亿美元。明年的投资预料还会减少。
    除此以外，由于经济形势的恶化，企业订货量、铁路运载量、出口贸易量都在急剧减少。而拖延已久的农业危机则在日益深刻化。因此，在这年终展望之际，美国资产阶级报刊纷纷议论的一个重要题目，就是美国经济已经开始的所谓“调整”会发展到什么地步。
