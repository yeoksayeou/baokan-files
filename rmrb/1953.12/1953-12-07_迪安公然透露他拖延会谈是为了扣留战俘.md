Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 4th—Our special correspondent reports: American representative Dean today made no secret of the fact that his reason for delaying talks between the two sides was to buy time to forcibly detain prisoners of war.

　　At today's meeting, Dean declared that he wanted to say some "irrelevant remarks." He then spent sixty-five minutes reading a lengthy "irrelevant remarks." In this speech, he did not mention a single word about the Korean-Chinese side's suggestions, but talked at length about the so-called "part of the history of Article 11 of the Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission." He hypocritically talked about the "human rights, humanitarian spirit, and freedom" of prisoners of war and tried his best to defend the murder crimes of the special agent elements arranged by the U.S. side in the POW camps in Dongchang-ri. He insisted that the political conference could only discuss the POW issue if it was held from December 22, 1953, to January 22, 1954. In this way, he wanted to undermine the provisions of Article 11 of the "Terms of Reference" and unilaterally and unreasonably prevent the discussion of the POW issue at the political conference. He said: "By January 22, 1954, prisoners of war must be released as civilians." He said extremely arbitrarily: "You cannot change it, neither the political conference nor anyone else can change it."

　　Dean's tone was exactly the same as that of American representative Harrison in the Korean armistice negotiations. Harrison also insisted that the political conference could not solve the issue of handling prisoners of war. The US plan is obviously to arbitrarily undermine the "Terms of Reference" at all costs and forcibly detain more than 20,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war.

　　The Korean and Chinese sides immediately exposed this US conspiracy and pointed out that the POW issue must be discussed no matter when the political conference is held. Qi Shifu said to Dean: "You'd better put away your hypocritical mercy for the prisoners of war." Qi Shifu pointed out that the US side's forced detention of prisoners of war prevented them from reuniting with their families, and asked Dean: "Your side wants to destroy the families of tens of thousands of prisoners of war. Is this your so-called fraternity and humanitarianism?" Huang Hua cited the radio receivers that the US side recently smuggled into the Dongchang-ri POW camp and the secret instructions that the US side gave to the special agent elements, which were intercepted by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and powerfully refuted Dean's defense of the special agent elements with facts. He pointed out that if Dean wants to deny these facts, as the Chinese saying goes: "He who eats mutton smells of it all over," he cannot deny it.

　　Dean talked at length about the history of Article 37 of the Armistice Agreement in the talks between the two sides on the 3rd, and today he talked at length about the history of Article 11 of the "Terms of Reference." This is obviously part of his delaying tactics. Dean publicly told American reporters after the meeting today that the reason why he has not been willing to seriously discuss the Korean-Chinese side's suggestions until now is to "emphasize" the US attitude, that is, prisoners of war must be "released" on January 22 next year. To put it bluntly, it is to drag the meeting to after January 22 next year, so as to unilaterally deal with prisoners of war without the discussion of the political conference and forcibly detain them. Today, he asked for a one-day adjournment on the grounds of so-called "administrative reasons." According to International News Service, this is because he is going to hold talks with Syngman Rhee. People remember that on November 26, Dean asked for a one-day adjournment on the grounds of "Thanksgiving." On that day, he held secret meetings with Syngman Rhee, and the next day, Syngman Rhee went to Taiwan to discuss with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits how to forcibly detain prisoners of war. Dean's so-called "administrative reasons" are obviously a conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war, which cannot be revealed.

### 迪安公然透露他拖延会谈是为了扣留战俘

    迪安公然透露他拖延会谈是为了扣留战俘
    【新华社开城四日电】本社特派记者报道：美国代表迪安今天毫不掩饰他之所以要拖延双方会谈，就是为了争取时间来实行强迫扣留战俘。
    迪安在今天会议上宣称他要说些“题外闲话”。接着他用六十五分钟的时间诵读了一篇冗长的“闲话”。在这篇发言中他对于朝中方面的建议一字不提，却大谈其关于“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”第十一款的所谓“一部分历史”。他假惺惺地说到什么关于战俘的“人权、人道精神和自由”，并且竭力替美方布置在东场里战俘营中的特务分子的谋杀罪行辩护。他硬说政治会议只有在一九五三年十二月二十二日到一九五四年一月二十二日举行的情况下，才能讨论战俘问题。这样，他是想破坏“职权范围”第十一款的规定，片面无理地不许在政治会议中讨论战俘问题。他说：“到了一九五四年一月二十二日，必须把战俘释放成为平民。”他蛮横之极地说：“你们不能改变它，政治会议或者任何旁的人也不能改变它。”
    迪安的这种腔调和朝鲜停战谈判中美方代表哈利逊的腔调如出一辙。哈利逊也曾经坚持说政治会议不能解决处理战俘的问题。美方的计划显然是要不惜一切代价地蛮横破坏“职权范围”，强迫扣留两万余名朝中战俘。
    朝中方面当场揭穿了美方这个阴谋，并且指出，无论政治会议何时召开，都必须讨论战俘问题。奇石福对迪安说：“你最好还是收起你对战俘的那种假慈悲吧。”奇石福指出美方强迫扣留战俘使他们不能和家人团聚，并且问迪安说：“你方想要破坏成千成万战俘的家庭。这就是你的所谓博爱和人道主义吗？”黄华举出中立国遣返委员会最近截获美方偷运进东场里战俘营的无线电收报机和美方给特务分子的秘密指令，用事实有力地驳斥了迪安给特务分子的辩护。他指出，迪安要想抵赖这些事实，正如中国俗语所说：“吃了羊肉一身膻”，是抵赖不掉的。
    迪安在三日双方会谈中大谈其停战协定第三十七款的历史，今天又大谈其“职权范围”第十一款的历史，这显然是他的拖延策略中的一部分。迪安今天在会后公开对美国记者们说，他之所以直到现在不肯认真讨论朝中方面的建议，为的是要“强调”美方的态度，即战俘必须在明年一月二十二日“释放”。这句话拆穿来说，就是他要把会议拖到明年一月二十二日以后，以便不经政治会议的讨论就片面处理战俘，把它们强迫扣留。他今天以所谓“行政性理由”为借口要求休会一天。据国际新闻社说，这是因为他要去和李承晚举行会谈。人们记得，在十一月二十六日，迪安曾经以“过感恩节”为借口，要求休会一天。那天他和李承晚举行了秘密会议，第二天，李承晚就到台湾去和蒋匪商讨如何强迫扣留战俘。迪安的所谓“行政性理由”，显然就是不可告人的强迫扣留战俘的阴谋。
