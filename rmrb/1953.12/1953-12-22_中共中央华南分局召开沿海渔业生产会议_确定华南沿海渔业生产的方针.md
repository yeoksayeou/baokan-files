Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, December 20th: The South China Sub-Bureau of the CPC Central Committee convened the South China Coastal Fishery Production Conference in Guangzhou from December 5th to 8th. The conference summarized the work of democratic reform among fishermen over the past year and, based on the general line of the state during the transition period, determined the future direction and tasks of fishery production in South China. The conference held that, during the state's transition period, fisheries, like agriculture and handicrafts, must undergo socialist transformation. In the future, production will be developed on the basis of vigorous recovery. At present, the focus will be on restoring deep-sea operations, actively supporting shallow-sea operations, gradually developing and consolidating state-owned aquatic enterprises, and actively guiding fishermen to take the road of mutual assistance and cooperation. Within five years, efforts will be made to reach the pre-war level of 410,000 tons of annual fish production.

South China's coast has numerous fishing ports, good fishing grounds, and abundant fish resources. Before the war, the annual production reached 410,000 tons, making it an important fish-producing area in China. Fishery production in South China occupies an important position in economic construction. The total fish production in Guangdong's coastal areas alone accounts for one-third of the province's total production value. Over the past four years, the recovery of fisheries in South China has created favorable conditions for the future socialist transformation of fisheries. This year, democratic reforms have been carried out in all fishing ports, and county, district, and township governments have been established. A total of 477 mutual aid teams have been organized in the entire region. This year, the People's Government has also issued more than 48 billion yuan in loans to support fishermen in developing production. This year, the fishery production in Guangdong Province alone has reached more than 230,000 tons, an increase of more than 30,000 tons compared to last year. In order to cooperate with the country's large-scale economic construction and complete the future fishery production tasks in South China, the conference requested that the CPC county and district committees in coastal South China must take the leadership of fishery production as the central task of their future work. The Party committees and people's governments of coastal counties that focus on agricultural production should establish fishery production work departments to specifically lead fishery production. The conference studied the socialist transformation of fisheries. Before the autumn fishing season next year, South China plans to pilot six or seven fishery production cooperatives. For independent shallow-sea producers, mutual aid teams will be developed on a large scale. The original mutual aid teams in various places, if conditions permit, can be converted into production cooperatives. As for fishery capitalists, they can take the road of state capitalism. In order to cooperate with the development of fishery production, the conference also decided to strengthen aquatic product supply and marketing work in various places, establish aquatic product supply stations and supply and marketing cooperatives universally, strengthen the management of aquatic product markets, and prepare to issue a large number of fishery loans to assist fishermen engaged in deep-sea operations in building new fishing boats.

    中共中央华南分局召开沿海渔业生产会议
    确定华南沿海渔业生产的方针
      【新华社广州二十日电】中共中央华南分局十二月五日到八日在广州召开华南沿海渔业生产会议。会议总结了一年来渔民民主改革工作，并根据国家在过渡时期的总路线决定今后华南渔业生产的方针和任务。会议认为：在国家过渡时期的渔业也和农业、手工业一样，必须进行社会主义改造。今后将在大力恢复的基础上发展生产。目前以恢复深海作业为主，积极扶植浅海作业，逐步发展和巩固国营水产企业，积极引导渔民走互助合作的道路，五年内争取鱼产年产量达到战前四十一万吨的水平。
    华南沿海渔港众多，渔场好，鱼产丰富，战前年产量达四十一万吨，是我国重要鱼产区。华南渔业生产在经济建设中占有重要地位，仅广东沿海鱼产总量就占全省生产总值三分之一。四年来，华南渔业恢复工作，已给今后渔业社会主义改造创造了有利条件。今年各渔港都进行了民主改革，建立了县、区、乡政权。全区已组织了四百七十七个互助组。今年人民政府又发放四百八十多亿元贷款，扶助渔民发展生产。今年仅广东省的渔业生产量已达二十三万多吨，比去年增产三万多吨。为了配合国家大规模的经济建设，完成华南区今后的渔业生产任务，会议要求华南沿海中共县、区党委必须把领导渔业生产作为今后工作的中心任务。以农业生产为主的沿海县份的党委机关和人民政府，应增设渔业生产工作部门，专门领导渔业生产。会议对渔业的社会主义改造作了研究。明年秋汛前，华南准备试办六、七个渔业生产合作社。浅海独立生产者，大量发展互助组。各地原有的互助组，条件具备的即可转为生产合作社。至于渔业资本家可以走国家资本主义道路。为了配合渔业生产的发展，会议还决定加强各地水产供销工作，普遍设立水产供应站和供销合作社，加强水产市场管理，并准备发放大量渔贷协助深海作业的渔民置造新渔船。
