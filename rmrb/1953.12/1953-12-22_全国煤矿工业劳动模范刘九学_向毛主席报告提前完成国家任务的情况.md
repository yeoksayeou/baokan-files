Reports to Chairman Mao on Early Completion of National Tasks

Respected Chairman Mao:

	I am writing to you with excitement to report on the production achievements of my team in the first year of the motherland's Five-Year Plan. My team comprehensively overfulfilled the state plan one month ahead of schedule in November: output exceeded 656 tons, and efficiency increased by 10.2%; in terms of major material consumption, pit wood consumption decreased by 10.8%, explosives consumption decreased by 24.02%, and detonator consumption decreased by 7.92%; in terms of safety, there were no deaths or serious injuries. In addition, we completed our team's fourth-quarter production increase and economy plan of 480 million yuan ahead of schedule by 24 days, exceeding the plan by more than 3.9 million yuan.

	In January of this year, with the reform of production, we began to use the new coal mining method and promoted the Soviet large-face circulating operation, and the production outlook was completely renewed. At the beginning, because most of the workers (including myself) had low technical levels, we encountered some difficulties, such as not being able to control the roof and the roof release time being too long, which affected the progress of the circulating operation and prevented production efficiency from being improved. The problem at the time was that production efficiency could not be improved without improving everyone's skills. After thinking about it for a long time, I led everyone to study the technology and learned the "intermediate cut staged roof release" method from Wangfeng Mine, which solved the problem of not being able to control the roof, and the roof release time was shortened from the original 16 hours to 5 hours, ensuring the circulating operation. When we promoted the experience of using wooden plank false roofs in middle-layer mining, we encountered difficulties such as coal wall spalling and roof beam falling. The coal cutting machine could not be used. Our entire team of workers jointly researched and developed a method of using temporary sheds to overcome this difficulty, so that the coal cutting machine could be quickly put into use. In early August, our team implemented the work plan, overcoming the phenomenon of slackness at the beginning and tightness at the end in the past production, and basically achieved balanced production. When the national campaign to increase production and practice economy was launched, all employees of our team enthusiastically participated in the competition, formulated a plan to increase production and practice economy, and integrated the state plan and the plan to increase production and practice economy into the work plan, checking the implementation status once a day so that everyone was clear about the situation and could correct shortcomings in a timely manner. For example, the drilling methods of the three shifts in our team were inconsistent, and some had enough explosives while others did not, so we held a small experience exchange meeting to unify the method of drilling triangular holes, which reduced the consumption of explosives by 13.67% compared to the savings plan and also increased output. Therefore, in October, our team completed 46.49% of the total value of the fourth-quarter production increase and economy plan.

	In November, the mine launched the study of the national general line, and the production enthusiasm of all employees was even higher. Coal cutting machine operator Chen Shouhu took the initiative to help the electric conveyor operator operate the electric conveyor after cutting coal. He said, "Socialism is not waiting to come, but must be created through bit by bit of labor. If we work harder in production, socialism can be realized sooner." The roof pressure was high, and the wooden pillars were pressed into the roof, making roof release very difficult, taking six hours to complete, which was likely to affect the cycle. After research, we changed the double row of pillars to one beam and three pillars, and moved the pillar shoe from the bottom to the top, reducing the difficulty of roof release work; later, we changed the wooden pillars to single row pillars, and Dong Dezhou's team also created the "double rope head cycle fast pillar withdrawal method", which could complete the roof release in three hours and forty minutes, ensuring a regular cycle.

	Respected Chairman Mao, although we have now comprehensively and over-fulfilled the annual production plan and the fourth-quarter production increase and economy plan ahead of schedule, we will never be arrogant and complacent because of this. We assure you that we will continue to work hard, consolidate the achievements we have made, earnestly implement the work plan, strengthen technical learning, further promote advanced Soviet experience, do a better job in production, and strive for an early transition to socialism. We have decided to increase production by another 5,000 tons of raw coal for the country by the end of December as a gift to celebrate the New Year of 1954 with you.

### 全国煤矿工业劳动模范刘九学  向毛主席报告提前完成国家任务的情况

    全国煤矿工业劳动模范刘九学
    向毛主席报告提前完成国家任务的情况敬爱的毛主席：
    我以兴奋的心情向您报告我队在祖国五年计划头一年度生产上获得的成就。我队在十一月底提前一个月全面超额完成了国家计划：产量超过六百五十六吨，效率提高百分之十点二；主要材料消耗，坑木降低了百分之十点八，炸药降低了百分之二十四点零二，雷管降低了百分之七点九二；在安全上做到了没有死亡和重伤。此外，我们还提前二十四天超额三百九十多万元完成了我队第四季度增产节约四亿八千万元的计划。
    今年一月份，随着生产改革，我们开始使用新采煤法，推广了苏联大掌子循环作业，生产面貌就焕然一新。开始时，因为大部分工人（我也在内）技术水平低，曾碰到一些困难，如顶板掌握不住，放顶时间过长，影响了循环作业进行，使生产效率得不到提高。当时的问题是：不提高大家的技术，生产效率就不能提高。我琢磨很久，就带领大家钻研技术，并学习了王封矿“中间切口分段放顶”的办法，解决了掌握不住顶板的问题，放顶时间由原来的十六小时缩短到五小时，保证了循环作业。在中层采煤推行木板假顶的经验时，我们碰到了煤墙片帮、顶梁跌落的困难，截煤机不能使用。我们全队工人就共同研究出使用临时棚的办法克服了这个困难，使截煤机很快用上了。八月初，我们队里推行了作业计划，克服了过去生产上前松后紧的现象，基本上做到了均衡生产。当全国开展增产节约运动时，我队全体职工热烈地投入竞赛，订出增产节约的计划，并把国家计划与增产节约计划统编入作业计划里，每天检查一次执行情况，使大家心中有数，及时纠正缺点。譬如，我队三个班打眼方法不一致，有的炸药够用，有的不够用，我们就召开小型经验交流会，统一了打三角眼的方法，使炸药消耗量比节约计划降低了百分之十三点六七，还提高了产量。因此，十月份一月我队就完成第四季度增产节约计划总值的百分之四十六点四九。
    十一月份，矿里开展了对国家总路线的学习，全队职工生产热情更加高涨。截煤机手陈寿虎在截过煤后就主动地帮助电溜工开电溜。他说：“社会主义不是等来的，而是要经过一点一滴劳动才能创造出来的。在生产上多加一把劲，社会主义才能早一天实现。”顶板压力大，把木柱压进顶板里，放顶很困难，要六个小时才能完成，眼看要影响循环。经过研究，我们把双排柱改为一梁三柱，把柱鞋从下边换到上边来，减少了放顶工作的困难；后来我们又把木柱改为单排柱，董德洲班还创造了“双绳头循环快速回柱法”，三小时零四十分就能放完顶，保证了正规循环。
    敬爱的毛主席，我们现在虽然已经全面地、超额地提前完成了全年生产计划和第四季度增产节约计划，但决不因而骄傲自满。我们向您保证：要继续努力，巩固既得成绩，认真贯彻作业计划，加强技术学习，进一步推广苏联先进经验，更好地搞好生产，为早日过渡到社会主义而奋斗。我们决定到十二月底再为国家增产五千吨原煤，作为向您庆贺一九五四年新年的献礼。
