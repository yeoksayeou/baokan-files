Xinhua News Agency, December 17th: Vietnam News Agency reports: On the eve of the seventh anniversary of the nationwide resistance war in Vietnam, President Ho Chi Minh of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a letter to the people and armed forces of the whole country. The full text is as follows:

　　As the nationwide resistance war in Vietnam is about to enter its eighth year, I am very pleased to report to our fellow countrymen and soldiers throughout the country an extremely significant political victory that we have achieved: The National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam unanimously and enthusiastically adopted the Land Reform Law in early December this year to realize the slogan of "Land to the Tiller."

　　Since the French colonialists perfidiously launched the war of aggression against Vietnam, and the Vietnamese people have resolutely carried out resistance to defend the independence of the motherland, the situation has undergone great changes. At the beginning of our resistance war, we faced a difficult situation both internationally and domestically. However, the development of the international situation has become increasingly favorable to our resistance war. The strength of the world peace and democracy camp, headed by the Soviet Union, is growing stronger and has greatly surpassed the strength of the camp of imperialist warmongers.

　　Domestically, the strength of the Vietnamese people's heroic resistance war has continuously grown, and we have achieved brilliant victories in military, political, economic, and cultural fields. We have inflicted many severe blows on the enemy, causing them heavy defeats. Over the past seven years, we have annihilated a total of more than 320,000 enemy troops, greatly depleting the enemy's forces. In order to save their defeat, the enemy has tried its best to realize the conspiracy of "using Vietnamese to fight Vietnamese" and stepped up the expansion of puppet troops. However, the enemy's approach is tantamount to drinking poison to quench thirst. Over the past seven years, the enemy has spent three trillion francs. Such a large expenditure has exhausted the enemy's economic and financial strength, and the enemy has had to beg the US imperialists for further assistance, thereby increasingly becoming a vassal of US imperialism. On the other hand, US imperialism has taken this opportunity to enslave the French people and directly interfere in the anti-imperialist wars in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, attempting to replace the French colonialists in Indochina.

　　These facts show that the enemy's strength is weakening day by day, and our strength is increasing day by day.

　　Because our resistance war is just, it has been supported by the French people, the people ruled by France, and the peace-loving people of the world—who are increasingly resolutely opposing the French war of aggression against Vietnam.

　　On the occasion of the seventh anniversary of the nationwide resistance war in Vietnam, I would like to express my sincere respect to the French people and the people under French colonial rule on behalf of the Vietnamese people, express my gratitude to the working class around the world for designating December 19th as "International Day of Active Support for the Vietnamese People," and express my gratitude to the peace-loving people around the world who support the Vietnamese resistance war.

　　In order to defend national independence and world peace, our military and civilians have been engaged in a heroic resistance war and have achieved many significant victories. With the increasing strengthening of the unity of our people and the increasing active support of the French people and the peace-loving people of the world, our resistance war will surely achieve victory.

　　Because the French colonialists are still continuing the war of aggression, the Vietnamese people are determined to give them heavier blows, annihilate more of the enemy's active forces, and carry out the resistance war to the final victory.

　　However, if the French government is willing to achieve a ceasefire in Vietnam and peacefully resolve the Vietnam issue through negotiations, the people and government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are willing to negotiate with the French government.

　　Therefore, in order to achieve true independence and peace, all our military and civilians must fully complete the two central tasks of continuing the resistance war and implementing land reform. These two tasks are closely linked: in order to enrich the strength of the people and ensure the victory of the resistance war, we must implement land reform; similarly, in order to ensure the success of land reform, we must continue the resistance war.

　　Land reform, like the resistance war, is a serious struggle. Therefore, we must carefully, systematically, and with leadership carry out the work of mobilizing the masses, and absolutely avoid blindly rushing forward. In this way, land reform will surely be successful.

　　Fellow countrymen across the country! All soldiers and cadres!

　　Let us launch a competition to strive to complete these two central tasks, so as to realize the complete independence of the motherland and the true peace of our people.

　　The resistance war will surely be victorious!

　　National construction will surely be successful!

　　I extend to you my heartfelt respect and congratulations.

    越南全国抗战七周年纪念日前夕
    胡志明主席发表告全国军民书
    【新华社十七日讯】越南通讯社讯：越南民主共和国政府胡志明主席在越南全国抗战七周年纪念日前夕，发表告全国军民书。全文如下：
    当越南全国抗战即将进入第八年之际，我以非常愉快的心情向全国同胞和战士报告我们在政治上获得的一次极其重大的胜利，即：越南民主共和国国民大会已于今年十二月初一致热烈通过了土地改革法，以实现“耕者有其田”的口号。
    自从法国殖民者背信弃义地发动侵略越南的战争、越南人民为了保卫祖国的独立坚决进行抗战以来，形势已发生了很大的变化。在我们抗战的初期，我们在国际和国内方面都面临着一种困难的局势，但是国际形势的发展日益对我们的抗战有利。以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营的力量日益巩固，并大大地超过了帝国主义战争贩子阵营的力量。
    在国内，越南人民英勇抗战的力量不断增长，并且在军事、政治、经济、文化等方面，都取得了辉煌的胜利。我们已给予敌人许多严重的打击，使他们遭到惨重的失败。七年来，我们一共歼灭敌军三十二万多人，使敌人的兵力大为缺乏。敌人为了挽救它们的失败，竭力想实现“用越南人打越南人”的阴谋，加紧扩充伪军。但是，敌人的这种做法无异于饮鸩止渴。七年来，敌人耗费了三万亿法郎。由于这样大的耗费使敌人的经济和财政力量枯竭，敌人不得不乞求美帝国主义给予进一步的援助，从而日益变为美帝国主义的附庸。另一方面，美帝国主义又趁这个机会来奴役法国人民，直接干涉越南、高棉、寮国的反帝国主义的战争，企图代替法国殖民者在印度支那的地位。
    这些事实说明敌人的力量日益削弱，我们的力量日益增强。
    由于我们的抗战是正义的，因而受到法国人民、被法国统治的人民和全世界爱好和平的人民的支持——他们正在日益坚决地反对法国的侵越战争。
    值此越南全国抗战七周年纪念之际，我谨代表越南人民向法国人民和被法国殖民统治的人民致以衷心的敬意，向规定十二月十九日为“国际积极支援越南人民日”的全世界工人阶级表示感谢，向支持越南抗战的全世界爱好和平人民表示感谢。
      为了保卫民族独立和世界和平，我们军民一直在进行英勇的抗战，并且取得了许多重大的胜利。在我们人民的团结日益加强、法国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的积极支持日益增加的情况下，我们的抗战一定会取得胜利。
    由于法国殖民者仍然继续进行侵略战争，越南人民决心给他们更沉重的打击，更多地歼灭敌人的有生力量，把抗战进行到最后胜利。
    但是，如果法国政府愿意通过谈判在越南实现停战，和平解决越南问题；越南民主共和国的人民和政府是愿意和法国政府谈判的。
    因此，为了实现真正的独立与和平，我们全体军民必须全力完成继续进行抗战和实行土地改革这两项中心任务。这两项任务是密切相连的：为了充实人民的力量和保证抗战的胜利，我们必须实行土地改革；同样地，为了保证土地改革的成功，我们必须继续进行抗战。
    土地改革也和抗战一样，是一个严重的斗争。因此，必须谨慎地、有计划有领导地进行发动群众的工作，绝对避免盲目冒进。这样，土地改革一定会得到成功。
    全国同胞们！全体战士和干部们！
    让我们展开竞赛，争取完成这两项中心任务，以实现祖国的完全独立和我国人民的真正和平。
    抗战一定胜利！
    国家建设一定成功！
    谨向你们致衷心的敬意和祝贺。
