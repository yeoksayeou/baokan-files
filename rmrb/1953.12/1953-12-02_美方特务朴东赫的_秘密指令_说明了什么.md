What Does the "Secret Directive" of U.S. Special Agent Park Dong-hyuk Indicate?
By Our Correspondent Hu Jin

The secret directive from the Lee Seung-man group to the special agents in the Dongchang-ri prisoner-of-war camp, transmitted by the U.S. special agent Park Dong-hyuk and intercepted by the Indian Custodial Forces on November 8, "is an extreme secret known only to a few within the government of the Republic of Korea." It provides an irrefutable basis for understanding why the current explanatory work cannot proceed.

The U.S. Chief Commissioner of the Military Armistice Commission, Lacy, shamelessly denied, saying, "We once again refute your (referring to the Korean-Chinese side) assertion that we have planted special agents among the prisoners of war." However, Park Dong-hyuk's letter proves that the U.S. proxy in Seoul—the Lee Seung-man group and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit "embassy" in Taiwan—are issuing orders to the Lee-Chiang special agents in the Dongchang-ri prisoner-of-war camp, adjusting their organization, and strengthening their ties in order to carry out new criminal activities.

This letter conveyed the "order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Military Police" of the Lee Seung-man group, stating that the "commander" of the special agent leadership organization "Anti-Communist Youth Corps" controlling the prisoners of war in Dongchang-ri was located in the Lee bandit's "Military Police Headquarters." There was also a so-called "Branch 40," and in the camp where it was located, "those who wish to return to the North must be killed, because this will leak secrets." There were also four "deputy commanders," all distributed in camps equipped with radios. One of these "deputy commanders," Kim Sung-rok, was in the so-called "hospital" provided and managed by the U.S. military. According to Lee Jung-in, a returnee from the Korean People's Army, the special agent leader Kim Sung-rok served as the deputy commander of the 74th Battalion in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp on Jeju Island. Under U.S. instructions, he established the "Anti-Communist Youth Corps" in January of last year. After arriving in the neutral zone, he and his "secretary," special agent Baek Eung-tae, infiltrated the "hospital" to carry out liaison work, and the "Anti-Communist Youth Corps" was moved to Dongchang-ri intact.

This special agent organization of the "Anti-Communist Youth Corps" is directly commanded from Seoul, and they frequently receive codes from Seoul, communicating via radio. Many radios are set up in each camp area, and more continue to be added. On November 7, the Indian Custodial Forces discovered a portable radio receiver in a barrel of dry yeast distributed from the United Nations Command warehouse. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission protested this illegal activity by the United Nations Command. In addition to radio communication, these special agent leaders frequently sent people or personally climbed out of the barbed wire to go to Seoul. Han Eun-song, one of the recipients of Park Dong-hyuk's letter and the "deputy commander of the Anti-Communist Youth Corps," had been to Seoul once in early October. Moon Jang-soo and Kim Byung-hak, returnees from the Korean People's Army who were repatriated after explanation on October 31, had already revealed this fact. Moon Jang-soo was originally detained in Camp 35 of Sector E. The company commander, Tak Moo-yeol, told him that the special agents of each camp in Sector E held a meeting and decided to select ten special agents headed by Han Eun-song from Camp 36. In early October, they agreed with the special agent garbage truck driver and the U.S. intelligence agency in Munsan to escape from the camp that night. A U.S. military vehicle would pick them up. That night, Kim Byung-hak personally saw Han Eun-song and the other nine agents sneak out of the barbed wire and run to a small hill northeast of the southern edge of the demilitarized zone, where the headlights of the waiting car immediately turned on.

Park Dong-hyuk's letter conveyed the Lee-Chiang bandit gang's arrogant instructions to further disrupt the explanatory work. The instructions stated that the "Government of the Republic of Korea" had long requested the United Nations to "release" the prisoners of war, but this "had not been realized" for fear of criticism from world opinion. Now, after the Lee-Chiang special agents implemented the U.S. plan to disrupt the explanatory work, repeatedly interrupting it and forcing the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission into a state of paralysis, the headquarters in Seoul decided arrogantly that they should "not listen to explanations" at all. The instructions also brazenly attempted to completely tear up the "Terms of Reference," asserting that "not listening to explanations will absolutely not extend the period stipulated by the prisoner-of-war agreement." "The Republic of Korea has prepared to mobilize national power to release the anti-communist youth (falsely referring to our captured personnel)." This is entirely consistent with U.S. Secretary of State Dulles' speech on November 17, in which he stated that the U.S. was prepared to tear up the "Terms of Reference" and hand over the Korean-Chinese prisoners of war to the Lee Seung-man and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs respectively, forcing them to "re-enlist," as well as the U.S. representative's trick in the bilateral talks of delaying the opening of the political conference in order to drag it out for more than 120 days and forcibly detain the prisoners of war.

The facts prove that this directive from the Lee Seung-man group and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit "embassy," the U.S. proxies in Seoul, has been intercepted and exposed, but its plan to further undermine the "Terms of Reference" and bury the explanatory work is being stepped up by the special agent elements in the Dongchang-ri prisoner-of-war camp.

Kim Cheon-sung, a returnee from the Korean People's Army who escaped from Camp 52 of Sector G, said that Moon Jung-ho, the special agent leader residing in Camp 49 of Sector G, had previously instructed the company commanders of each camp to take various actions to disrupt the explanations. However, on the evening of November 20, the day before Kim Cheon-sung escaped, the deputy company commander, Lee Ji-soo, announced to the prisoners of war: "We will not listen to explanations from now on." Recently, Korean-Chinese returnees who risked their lives to climb the barbed wire and escape from other different camps and sectors in Dongchang-ri have also unanimously revealed that the Lee-Chiang special agent elements in each camp have told the prisoners of war: "The explanatory work has failed, we will not listen to explanations. If the political conference cannot be held after more than 30 days, we can run away. If the Indians don't let us go, the U.S. military will come to cut the barbed wire and release us."

The special agents in each camp are forcing the prisoners of war to prepare for escape while waiting for orders. Zhou Futian, Zhu Yufa, Li Fuyuan, Zhang Dejing (Zhang Dewen), Ye Zhicheng, Chen Yadong, Tang Degui, and others, volunteer army returnees who escaped from Camps 4, 5, 7, 9, and 11 of Sector B, said that the special agents in each camp there are forcing the prisoners of war to make armbands. Each armband is triangular, with the Chiang Kai-shek party emblem drawn in the upper corner and the words "A Heart Returns to Taiwan" written in red ink below, saying that they are preparing to wear them when they return to Taiwan. Some company commanders and squad leaders have already put them on. At the same time, the special agents are forcing each person to make two pairs of shoes and a new hat, tear up blankets to make leggings, and withhold the occasional distribution of canned goods, preparing for a feast when they return to Taiwan.

Returnee Li Fuyuan said that on or about November 9, he personally saw two U.S. military officers enter Camp 4 under the pretext of inspecting water pipe repairs and hand a "paper" about 60 centimeters in size to the deputy company commander. The next day, the deputy company commander, Zhao Xingchang, said to the prisoners of war during "class": "The map has also been brought. Everyone must be prepared to leave at any time. When the U.S. military comes to cut the barbed wire, everyone should run along the road. Don't run around blindly, don't get separated. After crossing the mountain, you will reach the Allied forces' position."

Returnee Ye Zhicheng said that Zhang Yuxiang, the company commander of Camp 5, announced that they would train soldiers for a month to prepare for escape. Kim Yong-woon, a returnee from the Korean People's Army who escaped from the "hospital," also revealed another fact. He heard a patient who was sent to the "hospital" from Camp 39 say that the special agents in that camp forced the prisoners of war to make "grenades" with gasoline in cans and dug a trench along the barbed wire to deal with the suppression by the Indian Custodial Forces when they escaped.

At the same time, the special agent elements in each camp are intensifying their persecution, threats, and inducements to the prisoners of war.

On October 31, the special agent elements in Camp 4 used the excuse of "celebrating the birthday" of Chiang Kai-shek to force the prisoners of war to dye blood flags. Later, they announced that in order to "express their determination to return to Taiwan, everyone must step up the dyeing." Each prisoner of war had to dye three blood flags, each two feet long and one and a half feet wide, using rain cloths with the paint removed. They also had to dye one Chiang Kai-shek national flag, five feet long and four feet wide, for each squad, platoon, and company. Blood was on every table and floor in the tents, and the smell of blood was overpowering. In addition, the prisoners of war were not getting enough to eat and were suffering from anemia. Some fainted on the spot after cutting their fingers with razor blades, but the special agents scolded them for "not having enough determination."

Not only that, but while dyeing the blood flags, the prisoners of war in Camp 4 were forced to tattoo 108 reactionary words on each person's lower abdomen. Before entering the neutral zone, their arms, chests, stomachs, and backs had already been covered with tattoos. The special agents forced everyone to tattoo the words and then shamelessly said, "This is the last time."

While our captured personnel were deprived of their right to return home, and their personality and self-esteem were subjected to even greater insults, the special agent elements used deceptive tricks, telling the prisoners of war: "You have dyed blood flags and tattooed your bodies. You will be welcomed when you get to Taiwan."

Are the U.S.-Lee-Chiang collusion to completely undermine the explanatory work and the conspiracy plan of the "Terms of Reference" exposed by Park Dong-hyuk's letter and the above-mentioned facts revealed by the Korean-Chinese returnees a mere coincidence? Is the development of this illegal disruptive activity by the U.S. side not enough to arouse serious attention and high vigilance?

Obviously, the U.S. attempt to forcibly detain prisoners of war after ninety or one hundred and twenty days by various means of disruption and delay is a violation of the "Terms of Reference" and is absolutely not allowed. According to the provisions of the "Terms of Reference," the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission must not only ensure that prisoners of war have the right to listen to explanations for ninety days, but also be responsible for guarding the prisoners of war who have not yet been repatriated within thirty days after the political conference is convened. Moreover, within thirty days after the one hundred and twenty days, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission may only cease its duties after declaring the prisoner-of-war status of prisoners of war who have not exercised their right of repatriation and for whom the political conference has not agreed on any other handling method to be removed, making them civilians, and giving them the opportunity to choose to go to a neutral country based on their application.

    美方特务朴东赫的“秘密指令”说明了什么
    本报记者  胡今
    印度看管部队在十一月八日截获的特务朴东赫传达李承晚集团对东场里战俘营特务的秘密指令，“是在大韩民国政府内也只有少数人知道的极端秘密”。它给人们理解当前解释工作何以无法进行，提供了一个无可辩驳的根据。
    军事停战委员会美方首席委员拉西曾厚颜无耻地抵赖说：“我方再次驳斥你方（指朝中方面）所谓我方在战俘中间安插特务的说法。”然而，朴东赫的信，证明美国在汉城的代理人——李承晚集团和台湾蒋匪“大使馆”，却正在对东场里战俘营中的李蒋特务发号施令，并进行调整组织，加强联络，以便进行新的罪恶活动。
    这封信传达李承晚集团“宪兵总司令官的命令”，在东场里控制战俘的特务领导组织“反共青年团”的“团长”，设在李匪“宪兵总司令部”；还有所谓“四十支部”，在它所在的营场，“必须杀掉愿回北部的家伙，因为这会泄露秘密的缘故”；又有四个“副团长”，都分布在设有电台的营场里，其中一个“副团长”金成禄则在美军提供和管理的所谓“医院”里。据朝鲜人民军归来人员李重寅说，特务头子金成禄在济州岛美方战俘营七十四大队担任大队副，并在去年一月就在美方的指使下成立了“反共青年团”，到了中立区后，他和他的“秘书”特务白应泰混入“医院”担任联络工作，“反共青年团”也原封不动地搬进了东场里。
    这个“反共青年团”的特务组织，直接受汉城的指挥，他们经常接到汉城来的密码，由电台进行联络。各营区电台设得很多，并继续增加。印度看管部队在十一月七日就从联合国军仓库分发的一桶干酵母中查获了一架轻便无线电收报机，中立国遣返委员会为此向联合国军的这个非法活动提出抗议。除了电台联络以外，这批特务头子们还经常派人或亲自爬出铁丝网到汉城去。朴东赫信件的收信人之一“反共青年团副团长”韩银松，即曾在十月初到过汉城一次。十月三十一日经解释后遣返的朝鲜人民军归来人员文长洙和金炳学，早就揭露了这个事实。文长洙原被拘留在E号营区三十五号营场，大队长卓武烈曾告诉他说，E号营区各营场特务开会决定由三十六号营场选派以韩银松为首的十名特务，在十月初通过垃圾汽车司机特务和在汶山的美国特务机关约定当天夜里逃出营场，由美军汽车接走，金炳学在那天夜里亲眼看到韩银松等十人潜出铁丝网，跑到了距离很近的非军事区南缘东北方的一个小山上，等在那里的汽车的电灯马上亮了起来。
    特务朴东赫的信，传达了李蒋匪帮进一步破坏解释工作的狂妄指示。指示说“大韩民国政府”早就要求联合国“释放”战俘，但因怕受世界舆论的指责“而未实现”。现在，李蒋特务执行美方破坏解释工作的计划，使解释工作一再中断，并迫使中立国遣返委员会陷于瘫痪状态之后，汉城的指挥部就气焰万丈地决定根本“不应听解释”了。指示并悍然企图彻底撕毁“职权范围”，断言“不听解释也绝对不会延长根据战俘协定所规定的期限”，“大韩民国已作好发动国力释放反共青年（诬指我方被俘人员）的准备”了。这和十一月十七日美国国务卿杜勒斯所发表的美方准备撕毁“职权范围”，把朝中战俘分别交给李承晚、蒋介石匪帮，强迫他们
  “重新入伍”的演说，以及美方代表在双方会谈中拖延政治会议的召开，以便拖过一百二十天，强迫扣留战俘的诡计，是完全一致的。
    事实证明，美国在汉城的代理人李承晚集团和蒋匪“大使馆”的这个指令，虽已被截获和暴露，但其进一步破坏“职权范围”和葬送解释工作的计划，则正由东场里战俘营中的特务分子加紧执行中。
    从G号营区五十二号营场逃出的朝鲜人民军归来人员金天性说，住在G号营区四十九号营场的特务头子文重浩过去指示各营场大队长采取各种破坏解释的活动，但当金天性逃出的前一天（十一月二十日）晚上，大队副李枝洙向战俘宣布：“以后不听解释了”。最近从东场里其他不同营区和营场冒死爬铁丝网逃出的朝中归来人员，也异口同声地揭露：各营场李蒋特务分子都对战俘说：“解释工作失败了，我们不听解释了，再过三十多天政治会议开不成，我们就可以跑了，如果印度人不放，美军就会来剪铁丝网，释放我们。”
    各营场特务正在强迫战俘进行等待命令逃跑的准备。从B号营区四、五、七、九、十一号营场逃出的志愿军归来人员周福田、朱玉发、李福元、张德景（张德文）、叶志成、陈亚东、唐得贵等说，他们那里各营场特务都强迫战俘每人做好一个三角形的上角画蒋匪党徽、下边用红墨水写“一颗心回台湾”等字样的臂章，说是准备回台湾带的，有些大队长小队长已经带上了。同时，特务又强迫每人做两双鞋子和一顶新帽，撕开毯子做绑腿，并扣发偶然分发的罐头，准备在回台湾时会餐。
    归来人员李福元说，他大约在十一月九日那天，曾亲眼看到有两名美军军官借查看修水管为名，进入四号营场递给大队副一张约六十公分大小的“纸”。第二天，大队副赵兴昌“上课”时就对战俘说：“地图也拿来了，大家要时刻准备走，当美军来剪铁丝网时大家就沿公路跑，不要瞎跑，不要跑散，过了山就到联军阵地了。”
    归来人员叶志成说，五号营场大队长张玉祥宣布练一个月兵，准备逃跑。从“医院”逃出的朝鲜人民军归来人员金龙云还揭露了另一事实。他听到一个从三十九号营场送到“医院”的病号说，该营场特务强迫战俘每个人用罐头装汽油做“手榴弹”，并在铁丝网边挖了一条壕沟，准备逃跑时对付印度看管部队的镇压。
    同时，各营场特务分子正在加紧对战俘实行迫害、威胁和利诱。
    四号营场特务分子在十月三十一日藉口给蒋匪
  “祝寿”，开始强迫战俘染血旗，后来宣布为了“表示决心准备回台湾，每个人都要加紧染”。每个战俘要用弄掉漆的雨布染三面二尺长一尺半宽的血旗，还要染班、小队、中队各一面五尺长四尺宽的蒋匪国旗。每一个帐篷里的桌上和地板上都是血，腥气扑鼻。加上战俘们吃不饱，都闹贫血症，有的用刀片划手指头当场昏倒，但特务还大骂“决心不大”。
    不仅这样，四号营场战俘一面染血旗，一面被强迫在每个人的小腹上加刺一百零八个反动字；他们在进入中立区前，双臂、胸前、肚皮和后背都已被刺满了字。特务强迫每一个刺完字后还无耻地说：“这是最后一次了。”
    当我方被俘人员既被剥夺了回家的权利，他们的人格和自尊又遭受更加重大的侮辱时，特务分子便施展诱骗伎俩，对战俘说：“你们染了血旗，刺了满身的字，到了台湾会受到欢迎的。”
    朴东赫信件暴露出的美李蒋串通彻底破坏解释工作和“职权范围”的阴谋计划，和朝中归来人员所揭露的上述事实，难道是偶然的巧合吗？美方这种非法破坏活动的发展情况，难道不足以引起人们的严重注意和高度警惕吗？
    显然，美方企图以种种破坏和拖延手段，在九十天或一百二十天后强迫扣留战俘，都是对“职权范围”的侵犯行为，是绝对不能容许的。根据“职权范围”的规定，中立国遣返委员会不仅要保证战俘得有九十天听解释的权利，还要在政治会议召开以后的三十天内，负责看管尚未遣返的战俘；而且还要在一百二十天后的三十天内，宣布解除尚未行使遣返权利、又未经政治会议为他们协议出任何其他处理办法的战俘的战俘身分，使之成为平民，并根据他们的申请，给以选择前往中立国的机会以后，中立国遣返委员会才能停止职务。3456789
