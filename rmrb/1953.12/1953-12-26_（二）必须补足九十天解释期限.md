    (II) The Ninety-Day Explanation Period Must Be Made Up
    Recently, the U.S. side has been constantly clamoring unreasonably, attempting to terminate the ninety-day period stipulated by the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" for explaining to all non-directly repatriated prisoners of war on December 23. To this end, the Korean and Chinese side sent a letter to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on the evening of December 23, firmly advocating that the explanation work should continue in order to make up for the ninety-day explanation period. This reasonable demand of the Korean and Chinese side is entirely in line with the provisions of the "Terms of Reference" and the interests of all non-directly repatriated prisoners of war.
    According to the Armistice Agreement, the purpose of forming the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the entire spirit of its "Terms of Reference" lies in ensuring that the side to which the prisoners of war belong has the freedom and convenience to explain to the prisoners of war for ninety days, thereby ensuring that all prisoners of war have the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated. In order to ensure that this basic spirit is implemented, the "Terms of Reference" made many important provisions, namely: no force shall be used against prisoners of war to obstruct their repatriation; prisoners of war must be released from the control of the original detaining party; the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has full power to exercise its legitimate duties, free from interference and influence from any party, and so on. It is very clear that only when these important provisions are effectively implemented, and the explanation work begins on schedule and proceeds normally without interruption, can we talk about ending the explanation work after the full ninety days. However, since our captured personnel were handed over to the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the U.S. side has used special agents to desperately obstruct and sabotage the explanation work, destroying all the important clauses of the "Terms of Reference," paralyzing the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and preventing it from fulfilling the responsibilities entrusted to it by the "Terms of Reference." Therefore, the U.S. side's arbitrary announcement of ending the explanation work on December 23 is a complete malicious distortion of the "Terms of Reference."
    Under the desperate obstruction and sabotage of the U.S. side, the explanation work of our side was delayed by twenty days from the beginning. After the explanation began on October 15, it was forced to be interrupted five times in a row, with the fifth interruption lasting as long as thirty-four days. Therefore, by December 23, our side's explanation work had only been carried out for ten days, and each day was less than eight hours. Moreover, even during these ten days, our side's explanation work was frantically disrupted by the U.S. "representatives" and special agent elements, and has never been able to proceed normally. The U.S. side used a large number of special agent elements who had illegally infiltrated the prisoner-of-war camps to threaten prisoners of war not to listen to explanations, carry out bloody massacres of prisoners of war who expressed their willingness to be repatriated, and prevent prisoners of war from being free from the control of special agents when listening to explanations. Today, not only can a large number of prisoners of war who have listened to the explanations not get rid of the fear of U.S. special agents to freely express their desire to be repatriated, but the vast majority of our captured personnel have not had the opportunity to listen to the explanations at all. Many of our captured personnel who have been repatriated have testified that a large number of our captured personnel who have not yet heard the explanations are eager to return to the embrace of the motherland. According to the provisions of the "Terms of Reference," they have every reason to demand a full ninety days of explanation time so that they can have the opportunity to listen to the explanations and exercise the right to be repatriated. Therefore, the U.S. side's announcement of "terminating the explanation work" is obviously "forcibly detaining prisoners of war." Facts have proved that the U.S. side used a special agent policy and other despicable means to prevent the explanation work from proceeding normally, in order to drag it out beyond the ninety days and forcibly detain prisoners of war. The U.S. side fundamentally tore up the basic clauses of the "Terms of Reference" signed by both sides and once again committed a serious act of bad faith.
      Another important provision of the "Terms of Reference" is that the issue of handling prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to be repatriated after the full ninety days of explanation time must be resolved by the political conference within thirty days. The U.S. side has also maliciously distorted this provision. Senior officials of the U.S. government have been constantly clamoring that regardless of whether the prisoner-of-war issue has been discussed by the political conference, the U.S. side will "release the prisoners of war as civilians" by January 22, 1954. Dean, the U.S. representative attending the bilateral talks on the political conference, said on December 21: "The time for the political conference to discuss this issue (referring to the prisoner-of-war issue) cannot be extended beyond January 22. If the political conference is not held, it will not affect the automatic entry into force of the timetable for the release of prisoners of war." These fallacies of Dean and his ilk are completely contrary to the provisions of the "Terms of Reference." The United States is attempting to stipulate that the political conference can only discuss the prisoner-of-war issue before January 22, 1954, while desperately preventing the political conference from being convened before this deadline, in order to achieve its conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war. The U.S. representative Dean adopted time-wasting tactics in the bilateral talks and deliberately provoked and interrupted the talks on December 12, which fully proves the U.S. side's despicable intentions.
    The U.S. side's distortion of the "Terms of Reference" is fundamentally illegal. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission is fully authorized to interpret the "Terms of Reference" under Article 24 of the "Terms of Reference" and make a decision to extend the explanation period. As early as September 24, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission had already made this decision. This decision is completely legal, and the U.S. side's opposition is unreasonable.
    The U.S. side's claim that December 23 is the deadline for explanation is baseless. Precisely because of this, the U.S. side has recently intensified its pressure on certain members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The U.S. "Washington Post" openly threatened India on December 22, saying: If India extends the explanation period, it will cause "resentment" from the United States and "create incalculable more difficulties in the relationship between India and the United States on the matter of military aid to Pakistan." The United States' use of such extremely despicable political means is obviously aimed at forcing the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to accept its arbitrary practice of unilaterally terminating the explanation period.
    Under the pressure of the United States, certain members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission have refused to accept the reasonable demands of the Korean and Chinese side regarding making up the ninety-day period, which is completely unjust. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission is fully aware of all the facts that the U.S. side has obstructed and sabotaged the explanation work, causing serious losses to our side's explanation days, but it has consistently failed to firmly implement the "Terms of Reference," and now it has deviated from the position of the "Terms of Reference" on the crucial issue of the explanation period. Certain members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission have clearly failed to fulfill their solemn responsibility of implementing the "Terms of Reference" and have violated the interests and hopes of all non-directly repatriated prisoners of war.
    At the Military Armistice Commission on December 21, Senior Member Li Xiangchao of the Korean and Chinese side has lodged the strongest protest and the most serious warning against the U.S. side's crimes of sabotaging the explanation work. Senior Member Li Xiangchao solemnly pointed out to the U.S. side: "The current issue is not the termination of the explanation work, but ensuring that the explanation work is carried out in accordance with the 'Terms of Reference' and 'Working Rules'; it is not what you call 'releasing prisoners of war as civilians,' but ensuring that all prisoners of war have the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated. The special agents and their organizations in the Dongchang-ri prisoner-of-war camp must be thoroughly eliminated, our side's explanation work must be guaranteed to be carried out in accordance with the 'Terms of Reference' and 'Working Rules,' the ninety-day explanation time must be made up, and the issue of handling prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to be repatriated must be submitted to the political conference for discussion and resolution." On the evening of December 23, the Korean and Chinese side emphasized this point in the letter to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The Chinese people fully support these reasonable demands of the Korean and Chinese side and will fight to the end to safeguard the right of all prisoners of war to exercise their repatriation. If the U.S. side brazenly disregards the opposition of the people of the world and forcibly interrupts the explanation work, then it must bear full responsibility for tearing up the "Terms of Reference" and sabotaging the explanation work.

### （二）必须补足九十天解释期限

    （二）必须补足九十天解释期限
    近来美方不断无理叫嚣，要把“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”所规定的向一切不直接遣返战俘进行解释的九十天期限，在十二月二十三日截止。为此，朝中方面已于十二月二十三日晚致函中立国遣返委员会，坚决主张解释工作应继续进行，以补足九十天的解释期限。朝中方面的这一合理主张，是完全符合于“职权范围”的规定和全体未直接遣返的战俘的利益的。
    根据停战协定，组成中立国遣返委员会的目的及其“职权范围”的整个精神，就在于保证战俘所属一方有自由与便利向战俘进行九十天的解释，从而保证全部战俘有机会行使其被遣返的权利。为使这一基本精神得以贯彻执行，“职权范围”作了许多重要的规定，即：对战俘不得使用武力阻挠其遣返；战俘必须从原拘留一方的控制下释放出来；中立国遣返委员会有充分权力行使其合法职责，不受任何一方的干涉和影响等等。非常明显，只有这些重要规定得到切实执行，解释工作按期开始而又不曾间断地在正常情况下进行，才能谈到在满九十天以后结束解释工作的问题。但是，自我方被俘人员移交给中立国遣返委员会看管以来，美方利用特务拼命阻挠和破坏解释工作，把“职权范围”的所有重要条款都破坏无遗，迫使中立国遣返委员会陷于瘫痪，不能完成“职权范围”所赋予它的职责。因此，美方蛮横宣布在十二月二十三日结束解释工作，完全是对“职权范围”的恶意曲解。
    在美方的拼命阻挠和破坏下，我方的解释工作时间，一开头就被推迟了二十天。从十月十五日开始解释后，又连续被迫中断五次，其中第五次中断时间长达三十四天之久。因此到十二月二十三日止，我方的解释工作只进行了十天，每天都不足八小时。而且即使在这十天中，我方的解释工作也遭到了美方的“代表”和特务分子的疯狂捣乱，迄未得以正常进行。美方利用其非法混入战俘营的大批特务分子，威胁战俘不得听取解释，对表示愿意遣返的战俘进行血腥的屠杀，并使战俘在听取解释时也不能摆脱特务的控制。今天，不但已听取解释的大批战俘不能摆脱对美方特务的恐惧心理来自由表达其要求遣返的愿望，而且绝大多数我方被俘人员根本没有得到听取解释的机会。许多遣返归来的我方被俘人员都证明，大批尚未听到解释的我方被俘人员都渴望回到祖国怀抱。根据“职权范围”的规定，他们完全有理由要求补足九十天的解释时间，以便他们能够获得听取解释和行使遣返权利的机会。因此，美方宣布“终止解释工作”，显然就是“强迫扣留战俘”。事实证明，美方利用特务政策和其他卑鄙手段，使解释工作不得正常进行，就是为了拖过九十天以后，强迫扣留战俘。美方根本撕毁了双方签字的“职权范围”的基本条款，再一次做出了严重的背信弃义行为。
      “职权范围”的另一个重要规定是，在充分的九十天解释时间以后，未行使遣返权利的战俘的处理问题，必须交由政治会议在三十天内设法解决。美方对于这个规定，竟也加以恶意曲解。美国政府高级官员不断叫喊，不论战俘问题是否经过政治会议的讨论，美方到一九五四年一月二十二日就要“释放战俘为平民”。美方出席关于政治会议双方会谈的代表迪安在十二月二十一日说：“政治会议讨论这个问题（指战俘问题）的时间不能延长到一月二十二日以后。如果政治会议没有举行，那毫不影响释放战俘时间表的自动生效。”迪安之流的这些谬论是完全违反“职权范围”的规定的。美国一边企图规定政治会议只能在一九五四年一月二十二日以前讨论战俘问题，一边就拼命使政治会议在这个期限以前不能够召开，以图达到它强迫扣留战俘的预谋。美方代表迪安在双方会谈中采取了消磨时间的伎俩，并于十二月十二日故意寻衅中断了会谈，这就完全证明了美方的卑鄙用心。
    美方对于“职权范围”的曲解，根本是非法的。中立国遣返委员会根据“职权范围”第二十四款完全有权力解释“职权范围”，并作出顺延解释期限的决定。早在九月二十四日，中立国遣返委员会就已经作出了这个决定。这个决定是完全合法的，美方的反对是毫无道理的。
    美方把十二月二十三日作为解释截止期限是毫无根据的，正因为这样，美方近日便对中立国遣返委员会的某些成员加紧施加压力。美国“华盛顿邮报”在十二月二十二日公然威胁印度说：如果印度延长解释期限，就会引起美国的“反感”，“并在印度与美国对军事援助巴基斯坦一事关系上造成不可估计的更多困难。”美国使用这种极端卑鄙的政治手段，显然是为了强迫中立国遣返委员会接受它片面截止解释期限的蛮横做法。
    在美国的压力下，中立国遣返委员会的某些委员竟拒绝接受朝中方面关于补足九十天期限的合理主张，这是完全不公正的。中立国遣返委员会完全知道美方阻挠和破坏解释工作，使我方解释日期遭受严重损失的全部事实，但是它一直未能坚决实施 “职权范围”，现在又在解释期限这个关键问题上离开了“职权范围”的立场，中立国遣返委员会的某些委员显然没有负起执行“职权范围”的庄严职责，并违背了不直接遣返的战俘全体的利益和希望。
    在十二月二十一日的军事停战委员会上，朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将已对美方破坏解释工作的罪行提出了最强硬的抗议和最严重的警告。李相朝中将对美方严正指出：“目前的问题不是解释工作的终止，而是保证解释工作按照‘职权范围’与
  ‘工作细则’进行，不是你方所谓‘释放战俘为平民’，而是保证全部战俘有机会行使其被遣返的权利。你方在东场里战俘营的特务及其组织必须彻底予以肃清，我方解释工作必须保证其按照‘职权范围’与‘工作细则’进行，九十天的解释时间必须予以补足，未行使其遣返权利的战俘的处理问题必须交由政治会议讨论和解决。”十二月二十三日晚，朝中方面在致中立国遣返委员会的信中，同样强调地指出了这一点。中国人民完全拥护朝中方面的这些合理主张，并将为维护全部战俘行使其被遣返的权利而斗争到底。美方如果悍然不顾世界人民的反对而强行打断解释工作的进行，那就必须对撕毁
  “职权范围”、破坏解释工作负全部的责任。
