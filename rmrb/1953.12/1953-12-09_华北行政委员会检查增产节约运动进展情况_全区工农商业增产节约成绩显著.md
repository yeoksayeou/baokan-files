    The North China Administrative Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council held six consecutive administrative meetings from mid-October to the end of November to inspect the progress of the Increase Production and Practice Economy campaign in its subordinate departments and to arrange future work in order to promote the Increase Production and Practice Economy campaign to develop more deeply.
    The inspection shows that due to the deeply rooted Increase Production and Practice Economy campaign, the active actions of the broad masses of workers, and the combination of competition and improved enterprise management, the North China region has made great achievements in increasing production and practicing economy in various systems. In the industrial sector: State-owned factories and mines completed 105.6 percent of their output value plan in September and 106 percent in October. By the end of October, the cumulative completion of the annual state plan by state-owned and local state-owned industries in the region was over 82.6 percent; a small number of units had already completed their annual plans. By the end of the year, industry and transportation in the region will be able to increase profits turned over to the state by 1.5 trillion yuan. The breadth and comprehensiveness of this campaign are unprecedented. Not only have larger state-owned factories and mines launched competitions, but also smaller local state-owned factories and mines and some private factories and mines have launched competitions. 70 to 80 percent of the groups have made group competition plans. Among them, groups with concrete plans, appropriate measures, and timely inspection accounted for about 30 to 40 percent. Many Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members have made personal plans to ensure the completion of group plans. Through this competition campaign, enterprise management has been greatly improved; the promotion of advanced experience and the implementation of Soviet expert advice have made significant achievements; and many valuable suggestions on improving technology have also emerged among workers. For example, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, based on Soviet advanced experience, adopted methods such as "external desulfurization" and "soaking furnace slag" washing furnace, and over-fulfilled the plan by 8.6 percent in September. Other industries such as flour milling, winemaking, and oil pressing have also made new creations. In the competition, various places have organized experience exchange meetings to promote advanced experience. For example, the North China Local Industry Bureau convened experience exchange meetings on flour milling and papermaking, Shanxi convened experience exchange meetings on rapid coal mine tunneling, safe production, and operation plans, and Hebei convened experience exchange meetings on advanced oil pressing experience, and also launched inter-factory competitions. A certain place in Tianjin organized competitions in the same type of work, and all achieved significant results.
    In terms of basic construction: By the end of October, the region had completed 84 percent of its annual task. Except for a portion that needs to be planned for multi-year projects, it is estimated that more than 90 percent of the task can be completed this year. The quality of general projects has been improved. In the competition, the responsibility system movement was further developed, advanced experience was promoted, and labor efficiency was improved. The sheet metal workers of the First Engineering Zone of the Second Construction Engineering Company directly under North China created eccentric iron cubic handles, increasing efficiency by 200 percent. Workers on Pukou Road in Tianjin created steel bar straighteners, increasing efficiency by 20 times. The efficiency of construction projects in Beijing, Tianjin, Taiyuan, and Tangshan has generally increased by 14 to 60 percent. The main key to practicing economy in construction projects lies in design. The North China Construction Engineering Bureau organized a large number of designers to conduct design quality inspections at construction sites. According to statistics from only six construction sites, changing unreasonable designs can save about 6 billion yuan without affecting quality. Through on-site inspections, designers were educated with concrete and vivid facts, which promoted the Increase Production and Practice Economy campaign.
    In agriculture: In the Increase Production and Practice Economy campaign, the policy of increasing grain production was emphasized, and the leadership of the "Three Autumns" work was seized. The region has completed the winter wheat sowing work. According to statistics as of the beginning of November, the sown area has increased by more than 10.93 million mu compared to 1952, and the policy and measures to increase yield per unit area have been implemented, laying the foundation for increasing wheat production next year.
    In the state-owned commercial system, the Increase Production and Practice Economy campaign expanded sales and improved business management. The Tianjin Electrical and Mechanical Procurement and Supply Station put forward the requirements of four quicks (quick reception, quick inspection, quick stacking, quick transportation) for nine major products, and adopted the working method of "dismantling, inspecting, and issuing immediately," which increased work efficiency by 30 to 50 percent; Yuci Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company in Shanxi held a forum for business personnel from county and grassroots cooperatives and invited them to visit the warehouse. In three days, 6,448 bolts of cloth were sold, totaling 1.94 billion yuan. An agreement was also signed for regular purchases next year.
    In terms of economy: All business departments in the region have reduced administrative expenses for undertakings that can be postponed or not done in accordance with the spirit of austerity. The agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy sector reduced 60 billion yuan. The health bureau of the cultural and educational system reduced more than 55 billion yuan, the education bureau reduced more than 39 billion yuan, and the culture bureau reduced more than 18 billion yuan.
    However, the development of the movement is still not balanced. For example, some factories and mines have not fully mobilized workers; some factories and mines have not grasped the central link or lack concrete solutions to problems; a small number of factories and mines have not been able to carry out competitions well due to difficulties in supply and sales or chaotic management; some factories and mines have also experienced an increase in accidents, a decrease in quality, and rush tasks. The development of the Increase Production and Practice Economy campaign in the commercial system is also not widespread and in-depth. Some areas have not implemented the spirit of vigorously relying on and supporting cooperatives, which has affected the promotion of industrial products; some units only focus on finding ways to save money and neglect to expand commodity circulation. The North China Administrative Committee specifically pointed out that increasing production and practicing economy is not only this year's task, but also a long-term task. Therefore, the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy should be implemented in the 1954 plan and even the Five-Year Plan to ensure the smooth progress of national construction. To this end, all subordinate business departments are required to continue to strengthen specific leadership and take effective measures to deepen the movement and ensure the completion of this year's Increase Production and Practice Economy task. It specifically requires leading cadres of all state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines to go deep into the grassroots and vigorously promote advanced experience. In the competition, they should earnestly prepare for the first quarter of next year's production, so that the production in the first quarter of next year will not be lower than the production level in the fourth quarter of this year. In addition to seizing the time to strive to complete the plan on the principle of ensuring quality, basic construction units must also earnestly summarize this year's experience and improve the political and technical level of grassroots cadres and technical workers through winter training to prepare for next year's basic construction. In addition to continuing to implement the central task of agricultural production as the overriding task in rural areas, agriculture must also seize the leadership of winter production (disaster areas are self-rescue through production) and the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Attention should be paid to improving farming techniques, solving the problem of supplying agricultural tools, especially small agricultural tools, and focusing on solving the fertilizer problem to increase production, accumulate funds, and support industry. State-owned commerce throughout the region must continue to implement the policy of serving production and serving the masses, and complete and strive to overfulfill the purchase and sales plan for the fourth quarter.

    华北行政委员会检查增产节约运动进展情况
    全区工农商业增产节约成绩显著
    中央人民政府政务院华北行政委员会，自十月中旬至十一月底，连续举行了六次行政会议，检查所属各业务部门增产节约运动的进展情况，布置今后工作，以推动增产节约运动更深入地向前发展。
    检查情况说明：由于增产节约运动深入人心，广大职工的积极行动以及由于竞赛与改进企业管理相结合的结果，华北全区各系统的增产节约成绩很大。工业方面：国营厂矿九月份完成产值计划百分之一百零五点六，十月份完成计划百分之一百零六。至十月底止，全区国营、地方国营工业累计完成全年国家计划的百分之八十二点六以上；有少数单位已完成全年计划。全区工业、交通运输业至年底将可增加上缴利润一万五千亿元。这次运动的广泛性和全面性是空前的。不仅较大的国营厂矿发动了竞赛，而且地方国营的小厂矿及部分私营厂矿也发动了竞赛。百分之七、八十的小组都订了小组竞赛计划。其中计划具体、措施得当、又能及时检查的小组约占百分之三、四十。许多共产党员和青年团员都订了个人计划，保证了小组计划的完成。通过这次竞赛运动，大大地改进了企业管理工作；推广先进经验和执行苏联专家建议有显著成绩；职工中也出现了很多关于改进技术的宝贵意见。如石景山钢铁厂根据苏联先进经验，采取“炉外脱硫”、
  “均热炉渣”洗炉等办法，九月份超额完成计划百分之八点六。其他如制粉、酿酒、榨油等等行业都有新的创造。在竞赛中各地都组织了经验交流会，推广先进经验。如华北地方工业局召开了制粉、造纸经验交流会，山西召开了煤矿快速掘进、安全生产及作业计划经验交流会，河北召开了榨油先进经验交流会，还发动了厂际竞赛，天津某地组织了同工种竞赛，都取得很显著的成效。
    基本建设方面：截至十月底，全区已完成全年任务的百分之八十四。除一部分需要有计划地变成跨年度工程外，估计今年可完成任务的百分之九十以上。一般工程质量都有改进。在竞赛中，进一步开展了责任制运动，推广了先进经验，提高了劳动效率。华北直属第二建筑工程公司一工区白铁工人创造偏铁立方搬子，效率提高了百分之二百，天津浦口道工人创造钢筋拉直器，效率提高了二十倍。北京、天津、太原、唐山四个市的建筑工程效率一般都提高了百分之十四到六十。建筑工程中厉行节约的主要关键在于设计，华北建筑工程局组织了大批设计人员到施工现场进行了设计质量检查，仅据六个工地的统计，在不影响质量的条件下，改变了不合理的设计约可节约六十亿元。通过现场检查，以具体生动的事实教育了设计人员，推动了增产节约运动。
    农业方面：在增产节约运动中，着重贯彻了增产粮食的方针，并抓紧了“三秋”工作的领导。全区已完成冬小麦播种工作，截至十一月初统计，较一九五二年增加播种面积达一千零九十三万多亩，并贯彻了提高单位面积产量的方针和措施，为明年小麦增产打下了基础。
    国营商业系统在增产节约运动中扩大了卖钱额，改善了经营管理。天津交电采购供应站，对九种主要产品提出四快（快接、快验、快垛、快运）的要求，采用了“随拆、随验、随发”的工作方法，提高了工作效率百分之三十至五十；山西榆次花纱布公司召开县社、基层社业务人员座谈会，并邀请他们参观仓库，三天就售出六千四百四十八匹布，总值十九亿四千万元。还签订了明年定期收购的协议。
    在节约方面：全区各业务部门都根据紧缩开支的精神，削减了可以推迟或可以不办的事业费。农林水利方面紧缩了六百亿元。文教系统卫生局削减了五百五十多亿元，教育局削减了三百九十多亿元，文化局削减了一百八十多亿元。
    但是运动发展还是不够平衡的。例如有的厂矿职工发动得还不充分；有的厂矿还没有抓住中心环节或缺乏具体解决问题的办法；少数厂矿因供销困难或管理混乱，还没有很好地展开竞赛；某些厂矿还发生事故增多、质量降低及突击任务等现象。商业系统增产节约运动发展也不普遍深入，某些地区还未贯彻大力依靠和扶持合作社的精神，影响了工业品的推销；有的单位只顾想办法节约，忽视了扩大商品流转。华北行政委员会特指出，增产节约不仅是今年的任务，同时也是长期的工作，因此应把增产节约的精神贯彻到一九五四年计划以至五年计划中去，以保证国家建设事业的顺利进行。为此要求所属各业务部门，必须继续加强具体领导，采取有效措施，使运动更深入一步，保证完成今年的增产节约任务。并具体要求各国营和地方国营厂矿领导干部要深入基层，大力推广先进经验。并在竞赛中切实为明年第一季度生产做好准备工作，务使明年第一季度生产不低于今年第四季度的生产水平。基本建设单位除抓紧时间在保证质量的原则下努力完成计划外，还必须认真总结今年的经验，并通过冬训提高基层干部、技术工人的政治和技术水平，为明年的基本建设做好准备工作。农业方面除继续贯彻农业生产是农村压倒一切的中心任务以外，还必须抓紧冬季生产（灾区是生产自救）和互助合作运动的领导。注意提高耕作技术，解决农具特别是小农具的供应问题，并着重解决肥料问题，以增加生产，积累资金，支援工业。全区国营商业必须继续贯彻为生产、为群众服务的方针，完成并争取超额完成第四季度的购销计划。
