Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 12th: As the American and Rhee gangs delay the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and attempt to provoke war, driving the Rhee puppet army to continue being sent to their deaths, the number of Rhee Syngman puppet army deserters is increasing daily.

According to a report by the Korean Central News Agency: The American and Rhee gangs, panicked by the frequent desertions of puppet soldiers, plan to throw these fleeing South Korean youths into prison for interrogation and murder. Starting on December 1st, they launched a month-long "Deserter Surrender Period," launching deceptive propaganda, claiming that those who "surrender" during the "Surrender Period" can serve at their original rank. At the same time, they dispatched military police, police, and armed secret agents to the homes of deserters to carry out brutal searches, torture, and arrest the families of deserters. Many deserters from the puppet army are unwilling to walk into the trap, and a considerable number of Rhee puppet army soldiers continue to escape from their barracks.

According to a report in the Pyongyang "Democratic Korea" newspaper: Rhee puppet army wounded and demobilized soldiers are in a very difficult situation because no one cares about their lives, and they are increasingly dissatisfied with the American and Rhee gangs. They often curse in the streets and have bloody clashes with the puppet police. The Rhee Syngman gang authorities have notified various places: "Temporarily prohibit the issuance of travel permits to wounded and demobilized soldiers" and do not allow them to go out.

    李承晚伪军士兵逃亡者日多
    【新华社平壤十二日电】在美李匪帮拖延朝鲜问题和平解决并企图挑拨战争驱使李伪军继续送死之时，李承晚伪军逃亡的人数日益增多。
    据朝鲜中央通讯社报道：因伪军逃亡现象频繁发生而惊慌失措的美李匪帮，要把这些逃亡的南朝鲜青年投入监狱加以拷问和杀害，从十二月一日起布置了为期一个月的“逃兵自首期”，发动欺骗宣传，说什么在“自首期”内“自首”的人均可按原级服役。同时却又出动宪兵、警察和武装特务到逃兵家中进行横暴的搜索，拷打和逮捕逃兵的家属。许多逃亡的伪军士兵都不肯自投罗网，而且正有不少的李伪军士兵继续从营房中逃出来。
    另据平壤“民主朝鲜报”报道：李伪军伤员和复员军人，由于生活无人过问，十分困难，对美李匪帮越来越不满。他们常常在街头咒骂，并和伪警察发生流血冲突。李承晚匪帮当局竟通知各地：
  “暂时禁止发给伤员和复员军人以旅行证”，不准他们外出。
