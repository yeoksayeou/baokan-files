Xinhua News Agency, December 28th: The song and dance performance of the National People's Art Troupe of the German Democratic Republic, sponsored by the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, held a grand opening ceremony at the newly built Tianqiao Grand Theater in Beijing on the evening of the 28th.

　　The Tianqiao Grand Theater was brightly lit, and the stage was decorated with the national flags of China, Germany, and the Soviet Union, as well as portraits of President Wilhelm Pieck and Chairman Mao Zedong. Huge banners reading "Welcome the National People's Art Troupe of the German Democratic Republic" and "Long Live the Friendship and Solidarity Between the Chinese and German Peoples" were hung on the stage and opposite the stage. After 6 o'clock in the afternoon, the theater was filled with people from all walks of life in the capital attending the opening ceremony. Among them were representatives from various agencies and organizations, as well as literary and art workers and cultural and educational workers from the capital.

　　German Democratic Republic Ambassador to China, Johannes König, and embassy staff also attended the opening ceremony.

　　More than 1,700 people attended the opening ceremony.

　　The opening ceremony was presided over by Liu Zhiming, Deputy Minister of Culture.

　　At 7 o'clock, the opening ceremony began. After thunderous applause from the audience, the National People's Art Troupe of the German Democratic Republic sang the national anthems of China, Germany, and the Soviet Union in succession, and the audience stood up in unison to pay tribute.

　　Liu Zhiming, Deputy Minister of Culture, spoke at the opening ceremony, wishing the art troupe success in its visit and performance in China. He said: The art troupe has grown up under the initiative and leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the government of the German Democratic Republic; it comes from the people and serves the people; it has inherited the excellent national art traditions of Germany and injected new life into them. Its performance in China is a major event in the cultural exchange between the two countries, which will undoubtedly enhance the brotherly friendship between the two countries.

　　Professor Pischner, head of the art troupe, also spoke at the opening ceremony. He said that the art troupe felt extremely honored to be invited to tour China and expressed heartfelt thanks. Culture can especially strengthen the already existing friendly relations between the people of all countries. The art troupe will definitely strive to successfully complete this task in China. He paid tribute to the working people of China with the German youth salute "Friendship".

　　Then, the art troupe began its song and dance performance. The first program was "Thank You, Soviet Soldiers!", a famous song written by Johannes Becher, winner of the Stalin International Peace Prize, and composed by Ernst Meyer, winner of the National Prize of the German Democratic Republic. The art troupe performed a total of twenty-three programs. Among them were works that successfully expressed the modern justice and peace struggle of the German people, such as the songs "Ode to President Wilhelm Pieck," "Thälmann Brigade," "Homeland, We Will Not Leave You," "Friendship—Unity—Peace"; works that expressed the excellent classical art traditions of Germany, such as Beethoven's piano, chorus and orchestra "Choral Fantasy," Weber's chorus "Lützow's Wild Hunt", "Hunters' Chorus," and Brahms' chorus "Good Night"; there were also beautiful folk art programs, such as instrumental music "Folk Instrument Performance," dances "Weaving Dance," "Hessen Group Dance," "Fisherman's Dance," folk songs "Echo," "Run! Miller, Run!", "On the Road Illuminated by the Sun" and so on. Every program was warmly welcomed by the audience. In particular, the Chinese songs "We Workers Have Strength" and "People of the World Are of One Heart" sung by the art troupe in Chinese, and the Chinese folk song "The East is Red" sung in German, aroused lasting storm-like applause from the audience. The last satirical ballet "Beat 'Lucas' Hard" made a powerful exposure of the corrupt and decadent American cosmopolitan culture.

　　After the performance, young Chinese literary and art workers presented flowers to the art troupe members to express their respect and gratitude for their outstanding performance.

    文化部副部长刘芝明在开幕式上讲话，预祝艺术歌舞团在我国访问演出的成功。他说：艺术歌舞团是在德国统一社会党和德意志民主共和国政府的倡议和领导之下成长起来；它来自人民又为人民服务；它继承了德国优秀的民族艺术传统，并且注入了新的生命。它在中国的演出是中德两国文化交流上的一件大事，这无疑将增强两国之间兄弟般的友谊。
    艺术歌舞团团长皮什纳教授也在开幕式上讲话。他说，艺术歌舞团对于应邀来中国作巡回演出，感到无上的光荣，并表示衷心的谢意。文化特别能使各国人民之间已经存在的友好关系更加密切。艺术歌舞团在中国一定努力来胜利地完成这个任务。他以德国青年的敬礼“友好”这两个字，向中国的劳动人民致敬。
    接着，艺术歌舞团开始了歌舞表演。第一个节目是“感谢你们，苏联战士！”，是由“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金获得者约翰尼斯·贝希尔作词，民主德国国家奖金获得者恩施特·梅耶尔作曲的一首著名歌曲。艺术歌舞团一共表演了二十三个节目。其中有成功地表现德国人民的现代的正义与和平的斗争的作品，如歌曲“歌颂威廉·皮克总统”、“台尔曼纵队”、“祖国，我们不离开你”、“友谊—统一—和平”；有表现德国的优秀的古典艺术传统的，如贝多芬作曲的钢琴、合唱与管弦乐“合唱幻想曲”，韦伯尔作曲的合唱“律左少校的勇士们”、“猎人合唱”，布拉姆斯作曲的合唱“晚安”；也有优美的民间艺术节目，如器乐“民间乐器演奏”，舞蹈“织布舞”、“黑申组舞”、“渔民舞”，民歌“回声”、“跑啊！磨房主人，跑啊！”、“在阳光照耀着的大路上”等。每个节目都受到观众的热烈欢迎。尤其艺术歌舞团用中文唱的中国歌曲 “咱们工人有力量”、“全世界人民心一条”和用德文唱的中国民歌“东方红”，更引起了全场观众经久不息的暴风雨样的掌声。最后一个讽刺舞剧
  “痛打‘卢卡斯’”，对腐化堕落的美国世界主义文化，作了有力的揭露。
    演出结束后，我国的青年文艺工作者曾向艺术歌舞团人员献花，对他们的卓越的表演致以敬意和感谢。
