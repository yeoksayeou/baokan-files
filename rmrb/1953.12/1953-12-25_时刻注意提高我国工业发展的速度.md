    The state-owned socialist industry is the material foundation and leading force for our country's gradual transition to a socialist society. In order to realize the country's socialist industrialization, we must fully utilize all possible conditions and strive to increase the speed of industrial development in our country, so as to maximize our industrial production capacity and increase the proportion of the socialist economy. This is the most glorious task of the working class and the people of the whole country at present. Comrade Stalin once said in summarizing the first five-year plan of the Soviet Union: "Our country is fifty to one hundred years behind the capitalist countries, and we should complete this journey in ten to fifteen years, either reach this point or perish." Following Comrade Stalin's teachings, the Soviet Union developed its industry at a high speed, ensuring that the Soviet Union developed from an agricultural country into an industrial country and from a technologically backward country into a socialist country with the world's most advanced technology in a short historical period. If our country wants to realize the country's socialist industrialization, it must learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and develop our country's industry at a high speed.
    In the past three years, during the economic recovery, the recovery and development of industry in our country has been quite rapid. Calculated by the total output value of modern industry and handicraft industry, 1950 was 128.9 percent of 1949; 1951 was 145.9 percent of 1950; 1952 was 131 percent of 1951; and 1953 is estimated to be 121.35 percent of 1952, of which the total output value of state-owned industry with socialist characteristics is estimated to be 129.4 percent of 1952. The reason why our country's industry can achieve high-speed development is that our country is a people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, and the leading force of our national economy is the increasingly powerful state-owned economy with socialist characteristics. Our country has great advantages both politically and economically; in addition, the people of our country are diligent and brave, and the working class, working peasants, and intellectuals of our country have a high degree of labor enthusiasm and creativity. This high degree of labor enthusiasm and creativity is the main force driving our country forward; and our country has rich resources, generous and selfless assistance from our great ally, the Soviet Union, and people's democratic countries, especially the guidance of Soviet advanced technology and advanced experience, as well as the specific help of Soviet experts. All this not only determines that our country's industry can develop at a high speed during the recovery period, but also will determine that our country's future industrial construction can continue to develop at a relatively high speed.
    In the past few years, our country was mainly in the period of economic recovery. Starting this year, it has entered the period of construction. It is often impossible for the development of industry to maintain the same speed in the construction period as in the recovery period, because recovery is relatively easy, while construction is more difficult; and because the base number of production volume is large, the absolute number represented by each percentage point increases year by year, and the increase in speed is more difficult. Therefore, we cannot demand the same speed in the construction period as in the recovery period. If we do not see this and only subjectively demand to maintain the same speed in the recovery period, we will also make the mistake of being impatient and rash in our work. But on the other hand, is it impossible to maintain a relatively high speed of industrial development during the construction period? The fact is not like that. First, there is still a huge potential capacity in our country's existing industrial and mining enterprises. Some equipment has not been fully utilized, and some equipment has even been shelved and not utilized. For example, the equipment of the national machinery industry has a great force that has not been utilized and brought into play; the equipment capacity of light industry is also not fully utilized; even in heavy industry and textile industry, which have a relatively high utilization rate of equipment capacity, there is still a certain degree of equipment efficiency that has not been fully utilized. Therefore, as long as the existing industrial equipment is adjusted and appropriately reorganized, it can exert a huge force and increase the speed of industrial production. At the same time, in factories and mines, the masses of workers have infinite wisdom and labor enthusiasm, and there will continue to be new inventions and creations, new rationalization proposals, and new advanced experiences in technology and production management, and labor enthusiasm will continue to increase; and in the past, we had many advanced experiences that have not been well promoted in some factories and mines. Therefore, as long as we continue to carry forward the labor enthusiasm and creativity of the masses of workers, promote advanced experience well, carry out rationalization movements, and find "tricks" to solve problems, we can further tap the potential of enterprises and increase the speed of industrial production. Second, because our country has begun planned construction, investment in industry is increasing year by year, and dozens of new, expanded, and rebuilt enterprises are put into production every year. Some of these newly built enterprises have the most modern equipment, which can increase the industrial production capacity and make many new products. This can ensure the gradual increase in the speed of industrial development in our country. For example, during the 1954 annual plan period, our country had 65 major newly built, expanded, and rebuilt enterprises put into production. These 65 enterprises will play a huge role in increasing the speed of industrial development. Third, in our country's existing enterprises, there are still many enterprises that can greatly increase production and increase the speed of industrial development in our country as long as they increase some technical measures, or add some necessary equipment, or appropriately transform and allocate existing equipment. Fourth, with the development and deepening of socialist transformation, many private enterprises will become joint state-private enterprises, and there will inevitably be great improvements in production management, the labor enthusiasm of employees will be greatly increased, and the utilization of equipment will be greatly improved. For example, the production of Tianli and Tianyuan factories in Shanghai has expanded six times from 1951, when they became joint state-private enterprises, to this year. This is enough to show that the implementation of joint state-private ownership can fully develop the production capacity of these factories, which will also help increase the speed of industrial development in our country. It can be seen that industrial production in our country can maintain a certain speed and strive for a higher speed. The conservative view that does not take active measures on the issue of industrial development speed does not conform to objective facts, and is harmful to the construction of our country, and is therefore wrong.
    However, some comrades cannot see many favorable conditions and positive factors, and only see some difficult conditions and unfavorable factors in industrial production, and they do not have the confidence to overcome these difficult conditions and unfavorable factors. Therefore, when they formulate production targets for their departments or units, they often look to backward targets, making the plan lag behind the objective reality. Some comrades have no idea and do not understand or do not deeply understand the situation in various aspects, so they cannot find ways to increase production. They even think that the potential has been exhausted, the "tricks" have been found, the speed cannot be increased, and they can only use lower quotas to compile the production plan for their departments or units. There are also some comrades who try to "hold back" when compiling production plans, hoping to complete the plan effortlessly, so as to obtain a good reputation for over-completing the plan and get more bonuses. This is obviously a very bad idea. If we do this, it will be very harmful to the cause of national construction. Therefore, it is very necessary to continue to overcome and prevent conservative thinking in leading industrial production, and oppose the idea and practice of "holding back", so that every comrade who leads industrial production can recognize the significance of increasing industrial speed for the country to realize socialist industrialization and for building socialism; conscientiously understand the situation, fully utilize favorable conditions and positive factors, and increase the speed of industrial development.
    In order to maintain a certain speed of industrial development in our country and strive for a higher speed, in addition to solving problems ideologically, we must also pay attention to the following issues in specific work:
    First, we must make the greatest effort to expand our country's industrial base. That is to say, we must do a good job in industrial capital construction. In carrying out capital construction, the important issue is how to maximize the investment effect. At present, for the 141 key projects designed for our country by the Soviet Union, we should strive to complete them according to plan on the premise of ensuring quality, and make them put into production as soon as possible, which can greatly enhance our country's industrial base. It is of utmost importance to increase the speed of industrial development in our country. In addition, due attention must be paid to those industrial and mining enterprises that can increase production capacity with a slight expansion and reconstruction, so that they can be put into production as soon as possible; for those factories and mines that can increase production capacity by adding some technical measures and equipment, necessary funds must be given to promote their realization, so as to increase their production capacity. Of course, when expanding, rebuilding existing factories and mines and adding technical measures, we must proceed from the overall situation according to needs, that is, consider whether the products are necessary for society, and whether the addition of equipment and technical measures is reasonable for the entire factory and mine and the entire industrial unit, etc., and should not be carried out blindly.
    Second, give full play to the potential of existing industry. That is to say, we must strengthen the management of enterprises, implement planned management, strengthen technical management, improve the responsibility system, promote economic accounting, increase the quantity of products, improve product quality, and reduce product costs; we must continue to adjust the equipment of existing enterprises to make it more reasonable and give full play to equipment efficiency. In particular, local state-owned industries should pay more attention to the reasonable adjustment of the use of equipment; we must conscientiously promote advanced experience in enterprises, especially concentrate and promote those effective and decisive advanced experiences; we must always pay attention to enlightening the workers' conscious enthusiasm, carry out rationalization proposals, and reward inventions and creations; we must take concrete measures to consolidate the achievements of the increase production and practice economy campaign and make it regular. In this way, we can further improve the original advanced factories and mines, raise the backward factories and mines to the level of advanced factories and mines, and greatly improve our productivity.
    Third, in order to maximize the effect of capital construction investment, and in order to give greater play to the existing industrial production capacity, we must pay attention to assistance and cooperation in various aspects. Because the industry of old China was of a semi-colonial nature, the arrangement of equipment had many unreasonable aspects, and the distribution was also very uneven. This problem has not been solved in the past few years. In this case, it requires close cooperation between various enterprises, "using my strengths to make up for his weaknesses", in order to enable all industrial units to overcome the shortcomings of mutual duplication and mutual disconnection, and give full play to the efficiency of their equipment, and improve production in assistance and cooperation. To achieve this goal, from the perspective of the departments leading production, the needs and possibilities of various departments should be combined through the overall national economic plan, and the contract system and agreement system should be adopted to ensure the specific implementation of the plan; from the perspective of various enterprise units, we should advocate the spirit of actively serving other units, so that the work of various departments can advance in coordination, so as to achieve twice the result with half the effort. To this end, it is also necessary to oppose the isolated views and decentralism of small-scale peasant producers such as "everything for oneself" and "never asking for help from others".
      In the process of gradually building our country into a great socialist society, everyone should always care about the speed of industrial development, and take practical actions to strive for the increase of industrial development speed, and promote the early realization of the country's socialist industrialization.

    时刻注意提高我国工业发展的速度
    国家的社会主义的国营工业，是我国逐步过渡到社会主义社会的物质基础和领导力量。为要实现国家的社会主义工业化，必须充分利用一切可能的条件，努力提高我国工业发展的速度，以便尽最大的可能来提高我国的工业生产能力，增长社会主义经济的比重。这是我国工人阶级和全国人民当前最光荣的任务。斯大林同志在苏联第一个五年计划总结时曾经说过：“我们的国家比资本主义国家落后五十年到一百年，我们应该在十年到十五年走完这段路程，或者是达到这一点，或者是灭亡”。苏联遵循着斯大林同志的教导，高速度地发展了工业，保证了苏联在一个短促的历史时期内，由农业国发展成为工业国，由技术落后的国家发展成了具有世界上最先进技术的社会主义国家。我国要实现国家的社会主义工业化，就必须学习苏联的先进经验，高速度地发展我国的工业。
    三年多来，在经济恢复的过程中，我国工业的恢复与发展是相当快的。以近代工业与工场手工业的生产总值来计算，一九五○年为一九四九年的百分之一百二十八点九；一九五一年为一九五○年的百分之一百四十五点九；一九五二年为一九五一年的百分之一百三十一；一九五三年预计为一九五二年的百分之一百二十一点三五，其中社会主义性质的国营工业的生产总值预计为一九五二年的百分之一百二十九点四。我国工业之所以能获得高速度的发展，是由于我们的国家是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的国家，我国国民经济的领导力量是日益强大的社会主义性质的国营经济，无论在政治上或是经济上，我们的国家都具有很大的优越性；加以我国的人民是勤劳而勇敢的，我国的工人阶级、劳动农民和知识分子有着高度的劳动积极性和创造性，这种高度的劳动积极性与创造性，是推动我国前进的主要力量；而我国又有着丰富的资源条件，有着伟大的盟邦苏联及人民民主国家的慷慨无私的援助，特别是苏联先进技术和先进经验的指导，以及苏联专家的具体帮助。这一切，不仅决定了我国工业在恢复时期能够高速度地发展，而且必将决定我国今后的工业建设能够以较高的速度继续向前发展。
    在过去几年中，我国主要是经济恢复时期，从今年开始，则已进入建设时期。工业的发展在建设时期要保持恢复时期同等的速度常常是不可能的，因为恢复是比较容易的，建设则是比较困难的；而且由于生产量的基数大了，百分比的每一数字所表示的绝对数目逐年加大，速度的增长就比较困难。因此，我们在目前就不能要求在建设时期具有与恢复时期同等的速度，如果看不到这一点，只是主观地要求保持恢复时期同等的速度，也会在工作中发生急躁冒进的错误。但另一方面，是不是在建设时期就不可能保持较高的工业发展的速度呢？事实并不是那样。第一，在我国现有的工矿企业中，尚存在着巨大的潜在能力，某些设备尚未充分加以利用，有一些设备甚至还搁置着没有被利用。如全国机械工业的设备，就存在着很大的力量未被利用与发挥；轻工业的设备能力也发挥得很不够；即以设备能力利用率较高的重工业和纺织工业来说，也有一定的设备效能尚未充分发挥。因而只要对现有的工业设备加以调整和适当改组，就可以发挥巨大的力量，把工业生产的速度提高一步。同时，在厂矿企业中，工人群众具有无限的智慧和劳动热情，在技术上和生产管理上将继续有新的发明创造、新的合理化建议和新的先进经验，劳动热情也会不断地提高；而且过去我们有许多先进的经验，在一部分厂矿中尚未很好推广。因而只要继续发扬工人群众的劳动积极性和创造性，很好地推广先进经验，开展合理化运动，寻找解决问题的“窍门”，就可以更加发挥企业的潜在力，把工业生产速度提高一步。第二，由于我国已开始有计划的建设，在工业方面的投资逐年增加，每年都有数十个新建或扩建、改建的企业投入生产，其中有些新建的企业，又具有最近代化的装备，这些企业就可以增加工业的生产能力，并制成许多新的产品，这样就可以保证我国工业速度的逐年提高。如在一九五四年度计划期中，我国就有六十五个主要的新建、扩建和改建的企业投入生产。这六十五个企业，对工业发展速度的提高，将起着巨大的作用。第三，我国现有的企业中，尚有不少企业只要增加一些技术措施，或者添置一些必要的设备，或者把现有的设备适当改造和调配，就可以大大提高产量，也就可以提高我国工业发展的速度。第四，随着社会主义改造的开展和深入，有许多私营企业要成为公私合营的企业，在生产管理上必然会有很大改进，职工的劳动热情会大大提高，设备的利用情况会大大改善。如上海的天利、天原两厂，自一九五一年公私合营后到今年生产就扩大了六倍。这就足以说明实行公私合营后就能使这些工厂的生产能力得到充分的发展，也就有助于我国工业速度的提高。由此可见，我国工业生产是可以保持一定的速度并争取较高的速度的，那种在工业发展速度问题上不采取积极措施的保守观点，是不合乎客观事实的，而且有害于我们国家的建设事业，因而也是错误的。
    但是，有这样一些同志，他们看不到许多有利的条件和积极的因素，只看到工业生产中某些困难的条件和不利的因素，而且没有信心去克服这些困难的条件和不利的因素，因此当他们制定本部门或本单位的生产指标时，就常常向落后的指标看齐，使计划落后于客观实际。有一些同志，则是心中无数，不了解或没有深入了解各方面的情况，因此也就找不到提高生产的办法，他们甚至以为潜力已经挖光，“窍门”已经找绝，速度已不能再提高，只能以较低的定额来编制本部门或本单位的生产计划。还有一些同志，企图在编制生产计划时“留一手”，希望不费力地完成计划，以此取得超额完成计划的好名誉，并多得奖金，这显然是很不好的想法。如果按照这些想法做去，对国家建设事业就有很大害处。因此，很有必要继续克服和防止领导工业生产中的保守思想，并反对“留一手”的想法和作法，使每一个领导工业生产的同志都认识提高工业速度对国家实现社会主义工业化的意义，对建设社会主义的意义；认真了解情况，充分利用有利的条件和积极的因素，以提高工业发展的速度。
    要保持我国工业发展一定的速度和争取较高的速度，除了从思想上解决问题外，还必须在具体工作中注意以下问题：
    第一，必须用最大的努力扩大我国的工业基础。这就是说，必须搞好工业的基本建设。在进行基本建设中，重要的问题在于如何最大限度地发挥投资效果。目前说来，对于苏联为我国设计的一百四十一项重点工程，我们应该在保证质量的前提下，争取按计划完工，并使其能尽速投入生产，就可以大大增强我国的工业基础。它对提高我国的工业发展速度来说，有着极重要的意义。除此以外，对于那些稍加扩建和改建就可增加生产能力的工矿企业，必须同时给以应有的重视，使其能及早投入生产；对于那些只要增加一些技术措施和设备即可提高生产能力的厂矿，必须给以必要的经费促其实现，以增长其生产能力。当然，在扩建、改建现有厂矿企业和增加技术措施时，必须根据需要从全局出发，即考虑到产品是否为社会所必需，增添设备和增加技术措施后对于整个厂矿及整个工业单位是否合理等等，而不应盲目进行。
    第二，充分发挥现有工业的潜在力。这就是说，必须加强企业的管理工作，贯彻计划管理，加强技术管理，健全责任制度，推行经济核算制，增加产品数量，提高产品质量，降低产品成本；必须继续调整现有企业的设备，使之更加合理，充分发挥设备效能，特别是地方国营工业更应注意对设备的利用作合理的调整；必须在企业中切实推广先进经验，特别是把那些行之有效的带决定性的先进经验集中起来加以推广；必须经常注意启发工人群众的自觉，开展合理化建议，奖励发明创造；必须采取具体措施，巩固增产节约运动的成果，并使之经常化。这样，我们就有可能把原来先进的厂矿更加提高一步，把落后的厂矿提高到先进厂矿的水平，也就可以使我们的生产力大大提高一步。
    第三，为了使基本建设投资收到最大的效果，为了使现有工业生产能力得到更大的发挥，就必须注意各方面的协助和合作。由于旧中国的工业带有半殖民地性质，设备安置有很多不合理的地方，分布也很不均衡，几年来这一问题也还没有得到解决。在这种情况下，就要求各个企业之间的密切合作，“以我之长，补彼所短”，才能使所有工业单位克服互相重复、互不联系等缺点，充分发挥其设备的效能，在协助合作中提高生产。要达到这一目的，从领导生产的部门来说，应通过总的国民经济计划，使各部门的需要与可能相结合，并采用合同制度和协议制度，以保证计划的具体实施；从各个企业单位来说，应提倡主动地为其他单位服务的精神，使各个部门的工作协同前进，以便收到事半功倍的效果。为此，也就必须反对那种“一切顾自己”、“万事不求人”等农民小生产者的孤立观点与分散主义。
      在我们国家逐步建设成伟大的社会主义社会的过程中，每个人都应该时刻关心工业发展的速度，并以实际行动来争取工业发展速度的提高，促使国家的社会主义工业化早日实现。
