Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Central South China has achieved tremendous success in agricultural production this year. Currently, the final crops of the year in Central South China - cotton in the northern regions and late rice in various parts of the south - have been harvested. The harvests of grain crops, cotton, and other industrial raw material crops throughout the region are very good, especially grain crops and cotton, which have had successive bumper harvests since liberation, with increases of 4.47% and 5.12% respectively compared to last year.

This year, the total sown area of various grain crops in Central South China reached over 512 million mu, with the total output accounting for about one-third of the country's total grain output, an increase of about 4 billion jin compared to last year. Among them, rice production accounts for about 46.83% of the national projected total rice production. Central South China spans the three major rivers of the Yellow River, the Yangtze River, and the Pearl River, with most of the region in the temperate zone and part in the subtropical zone. Rice is harvested once a year in the Yangtze River basin and the southern hilly areas, twice a year in the Pearl River basin and the plains along Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake, and three times a year in some parts of Hainan Island. This year's early and late rice crops, due to favorable rainfall, generally increased by 8% to 10% or more compared to last year; the mid-season rice crop, except for slight reductions in some areas severely affected by drought, had good harvests in most areas due to successful drought resistance efforts, better than last year, with increases of about 10% in most of the plains along the rivers and lakes. From north of the Yangtze River to both banks of the Yellow River is a wheat and coarse grain production area. Although Henan Province suffered frost damage to wheat this year, after timely and vigorous rescue efforts, the total wheat production in the region still increased by 5% compared to last year; the autumn coarse grain crops (corn, sorghum, millet, etc.) also had bumper harvests. The yield per unit area of cotton in the region has significantly improved this year. Although the sown area was slightly reduced compared to last year, the total output still increased by more than 5% compared to last year, and it is estimated that more than 6.2 million dan of ginned cotton can be produced. Other industrial raw material crops such as flue-cured tobacco and jute have also overfulfilled this year's production increase plans. The output of flue-cured tobacco in Xuchang and other counties in Henan Province increased by 37.86% compared to last year.

    中南区今年农业生产成绩很好
    据新华社讯：中南区今年农业生产成就巨大。目前，中南区今年最后一季农作物——北部地区的棉花和南方各地的晚稻已收获完毕。全区粮食作物、棉花和其他工业原料作物的收成都很好，特别是粮食作物和棉花解放以来连年丰收，今年比去年分别增产了百分之四点四七和百分之五点一二。
    今年，中南区各种粮食作物的播种面积共达五亿一千二百多万亩，全部产量约占全国粮食总产量的三分之一，约比去年增产了四十亿斤。其中稻谷产量约占全国预计稻谷总产量的百分之四十六点八三。中南区地跨黄河、长江、珠江三大河流，大部处于温带，一部处于亚热带。水稻在长江流域和南方丘陵地带是一年一熟，在珠江流域和洞庭湖、鄱阳湖的滨湖平原是一年两熟，在海南岛的部分地区是一年三熟。今年的早稻和晚稻，由于雨水调和，普遍比去年增产百分之八到一成以上；中稻除局部地区严重受旱略有减产外，多数地区因抗旱有很大的成绩，收成比去年好，沿江滨湖的平原大多增产一成左右。从长江以北到黄河两岸，是小麦和杂粮产区。今年虽然河南省小麦曾遭霜灾，但经过及时大力抢救后，全区小麦产量仍比去年增产百分之五；秋季杂粮作物（玉米、高粱、谷子等）也是丰收年景。今年全区棉花单位面积产量有显著提高，虽然播种面积比去年略为减少，但总产量仍比去年增产了百分之五强，预计可产皮棉六百二十多万市担。其他烤烟、黄麻等工业原料作物，也都超额完成了今年的增产计划。河南省许昌等县的烤烟产量，比去年增产了百分之三十七点八六。
