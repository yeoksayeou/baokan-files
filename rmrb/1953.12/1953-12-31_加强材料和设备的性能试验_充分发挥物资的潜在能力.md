Reader Qian Zhi's letter: The "Da Liu Ling" radiators produced by the Northeast Machinery Plant No. 12 still use the outdated technical specifications from the puppet Manchukuo era: each piece (i.e., per square meter) has a heat dissipation of 650 kilocalories per hour. However, they have never re-examined the actual heat dissipation efficiency of these products. When the Northeast Institute of Technology built its new school buildings two years ago and installed radiators, it conducted several simple tests and proved that the heat dissipation efficiency of the "Da Liu Ling" radiators currently produced by the factory was 10 to 20 percent higher than the original standard set by the puppet Manchukuo. In this way, if we design according to this new heat dissipation efficiency standard, one "Da Liu Ling" radiator would suffice in places where one "Da Liu Ling" and one "Xiao Liu Ling" radiator were used in the past, which could save the state a lot of materials and construction investment. However, the factory is not sure of this new heat dissipation efficiency standard. This year, at the suggestion of the design department, the factory conducted forty to fifty tests with the help of professors from the Northeast Institute of Technology. The tests proved that the heat dissipation efficiency of the radiator increased by 23 percent when using steam. Although this test work was carried out very carefully, the various test conditions were not perfect enough. For example, there was no suitable testing equipment and the instruments were incomplete, so the test results can only be "for reference only."

This incident tells us that many materials and equipment have a great potential that has not been exploited and utilized due to the lack of scientific and accurate performance tests. This situation where scientific testing work lags behind needs has seriously affected the speed and quality of construction projects.

For example, in order to determine the engineering foundation, it is first necessary to determine the bearing capacity of the foundation soil. This can only be achieved with accurate conclusions through drilling and soil analysis. However, there are too few laboratories at present, and each department does its own thing, lacking scientific and unified management. As a result, many construction projects have to rely on unreliable load-bearing test methods to determine the foundation bearing capacity. According to the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, concrete construction should select the mix ratio according to the design document requirements and the specific conditions of the raw materials used in the project (such as cement grade, aggregate size, etc.) before formal construction, and make concrete test blocks according to the mix ratio. Only after testing and adjustment can the concrete be formally mixed and constructed (during formal construction, test blocks should also be left for post-test). However, there are very few agencies that can conduct concrete strength tests at present, and there are so many types of concrete and the number of test blocks that need to be tested, and the curing period of concrete is very long. Therefore, those testing agencies are simply overcrowded, and you have to wait for several months to get in line. The construction unit can't wait, so it has to adopt the method of testing after construction (leaving test blocks at the time of construction). However, if the post-test proves that the concrete has not reached the strength required by the design and the building is not safe, or the concrete exceeds the strength required by the design and causes a lot of waste, there is no way to remedy it. Seriously, there are still many units that do not even do this post-test.

At present, construction work is complicated and there are so many items that need to be tested. If all of them are carried out by the respective units themselves, it will inevitably lead to the dispersion of equipment, and there will be no technical and theoretical guidance. Therefore, I suggest that the Chinese Academy of Sciences establish comprehensive scientific testing stations in important industrial areas (or cities) (or the local governments of each region and city establish scientific testing stations, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences provides guidance in theory, technology and business). This kind of scientific testing station should serve the urgent needs of the economic construction in this region, and complete the scientific testing work that has been approved by the local construction leading organs and that cannot be completed by the local economic departments themselves. Of course, the establishment of testing stations centered on regions (or cities) does not mean that the testing work of each industrial system or each construction site can be ignored, but rather that there should be a division of labor. Regional testing stations should undertake a large number of universal tests and tests that individual economic departments are unable to carry out themselves. Each system and each construction site should undertake the testing work that is specifically needed and frequently needed by the department, or the testing work that does not require too complicated technical equipment and does not need to be entrusted to a regional testing station.

Editor's note: Reader Qian Zhi's suggestion is good. The performance testing of materials and equipment is particularly urgently needed at the present time when the motherland is carrying out large-scale economic construction, especially at construction sites. Due to our insufficient technical level and lack of equipment capacity, many necessary testing works have not been carried out, resulting in material waste and poor engineering quality. Establishing and improving the system of performance testing of materials and equipment is one of the important ways to ensure engineering quality and save materials. The Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering, the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry and other relevant departments should pay attention to the reader's suggestions, reasonably organize the existing human and material resources, and strengthen the performance testing of materials and equipment. In addition, it should be emphasized that the leading cadres and the broad masses of workers of all capital construction units should also attach importance to this work, correct the erroneous attitude of not recognizing that construction work must be carried out in strict accordance with scientific requirements and being perfunctory, or the erroneous thinking of excusing "lack of equipment" and not doing those tests or inspections that are even very easy and very simple. As long as everyone attaches importance to this work and actively thinks of ways, even though our human and material resources are still very insufficient today, we can still do a lot of work in this area that is beneficial to the construction of the motherland.

### 加强材料和设备的性能试验  充分发挥物资的潜在能力

    加强材料和设备的性能试验  充分发挥物资的潜在能力
    读者千之来信：东北机械十二厂生产的“大六○”暖气片，现在仍然沿用陈腐的伪满时代的技术说明：每片（即每平方公尺）每小时散热量是六百五十千卡。可是他们从来没有重新检验这些产品的实际散热效率。东北工学院于前两年建筑新校舍安装暖气时，曾做过几次简单的试验，证明该厂现在生产的“大六○”暖气片的散热效率比伪满原定标准提高了百分之十到二十。这样，如果按照这一新的散热效率标准来进行设计，过去用一片“大六○”和一片“小六○”暖气片的地方，现在改用一片“大六○”就够了，可以为国家节省大量的物资和建设投资。但是该厂不敢肯定这个新的散热效率标准。今年经过设计部门的倡议，该厂在东北工学院教授的帮助下，进行了四、五十次的试验。试验证明，在使用蒸汽时该项暖气片的散热效率提高了百分之二十三。这次试验工作虽然进行得很认真，但是试验的各种条件是不够完善的。例如没有适当的试验设备，仪器也不完整，因而试验结果还只能“仅供参考”。
    这件事情告诉我们：许多材料和设备由于缺乏科学的准确的性能试验，还有很大的潜在能力没有被发挥和利用。这种科学试验工作落后于需要的情况，在建筑工程中已使建设的速度和质量受到严重的影响。
    譬如，为了确定工程基础，首先需要确定基础土壤耐压力。这只有进行钻探和土壤分析才能求得确实的结论。但目前化验室太少了，而且各部门各搞各的，缺乏科学的统一的管理。于是不少建设工程就不得不依靠不可靠的载重试验办法来确定地基耐压力。混凝土的施工，按照苏联的先进经验，应该是在正式施工以前，按照设计文件的规定和本工程所用原料的具体条件（如水泥标号、砂石粒度等）选定配合比，并按照配合比制出混凝土试块，经过试验调整后，才正式调制混凝土进行施工（正式施工时，还要留下试块，作事后试验）。可是目前能进行混凝土强度试验的机关很少，而需要进行试验的混凝土种类和试块数量那么多，混凝土的凝固期又很长，因此那些试验机关就简直是门庭若市，一排队就得等几个月。施工单位等不了，只好采取先施工后试验（施工当时留下试块）的办法。可是，假如事后试验证明混凝土没有达到设计要求的强度而建筑物不够安全，或者是混凝土超过设计要求的强度而造成很大浪费，就没有办法补救了。严重的是，还有许多单位连这种事后试验也不作。
    目前建设工作头绪繁杂，需要试验的项目这样多，如果全部都由各该单位自己来进行，势必造成设备分散，而且技术上和理论上无人指导。因此，我建议中国科学院在各重要的工业地区（或城市）设立综合性的科学试验站（或由各地区各城市地方政府成立科学试验站，而由中国科学院在理论、技术和业务方面作指导）。这种科学试验站应该为本地区的经济建设的迫切需要服务，完成为当地建设领导机关所批准的属于当地各经济部门本身所不能完成的各项科学试验工作。当然，建立以地区（或城市）为中心的试验站，并不是说可以忽视各工业系统或各工地自己的试验工作，而是要有所分工。地区试验站应该承担大量的普遍性的以及为个别经济部门本身无力进行的试验工作。而各系统各工地则应该承担那些为本部门专门需要且经常需要的试验工作，或技术设备要求不太复杂不需要委托地区试验站试验的工作。
    编者按：读者千之的建议是好的。材料和设备的性能试验，在目前祖国大规模进行经济建设的时候，特别在施工现场，更感迫切需要。由于我们的技术水平不足和设备能力缺乏，很多必要的试验工作没有进行，因而发生了材料浪费和工程质量低劣的情况。建立和健全材料和设备的性能试验制度，是保证工程质量和节省材料的重要办法之一。中国科学院、中央建筑工程部和中央重工业部等有关部门，应该重视读者的建议，合理地组织现有的人力和物力，加强材料和设备的性能试验工作。此外，应该着重指出：所有基本建设单位的领导干部和广大职工也应该重视这项工作，纠正那种不认识建设工作必须严格按照科学要求来进行而马虎了事的错误态度，或者是藉口“缺乏设备”而不去作那些即使是极容易极简单的试验或检验工作的错误思想。只要大家都重视这一工作，积极想办法，尽管我们今天人力和物力还很不充足，我们还是可以在这方面做出许多有益于祖国建设的工作。
