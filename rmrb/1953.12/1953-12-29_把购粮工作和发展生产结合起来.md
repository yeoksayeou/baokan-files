    Combining Grain Procurement with Production Development
    He Xin
    In order to complete the grain procurement task and simultaneously achieve the goal of increased agricultural production, in addition to conducting in-depth propaganda among the peasant masses regarding the general line of the state during the transition period and grain procurement policies to raise the peasants' political awareness, it is also necessary to do a good job in various economic tasks to realize the peasants' demands for selling surplus grain and expanding production. The Gansu Daily has placed great emphasis on economic work in grain procurement reports, in addition to publicizing the relationship between the state's grain procurement and the peasants' sale of surplus grain to support national construction, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, and stabilize market prices, which is absolutely necessary.
    Since September, the Gansu Daily has given prominent publicity to grain procurement work. In this publicity, the newspaper emphasized the consistency between the state's purchase of grain and the peasants' desire to sell surplus grain to expand reproduction, stressed that grain procurement work must be combined with the work of organizing peasant production, and vigorously disseminated successful experiences in this regard. For example, the papers and communications written by leading cadres such as Xu Zongwang, Secretary of the Wuwei Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, Zhou Huanan, member of the Prefectural Committee, and Wang Fu, Deputy Director of the Wuwei Prefectural Cooperative Office, which were published continuously by the newspaper from mid-September, introduced the experience of the Wuwei Prefecture in grain procurement in a relatively systematic way. This experience is: based on the characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy of selling in order to buy, starting from organizing peasants for production and arranging economic life, completing the task of grain procurement through commodity exchange, and further expanding agricultural production. Xu Zongwang, Secretary of the Wuwei Prefectural Committee, emphasized in his paper the relationship between grain procurement and production, that is, the central task of rural areas is production. On the one hand, grain procurement is to purchase the necessary grain for the country, and on the other hand, it is to find the best way out for the peasants' surplus grain and help the peasants effectively use the surplus grain to expand production, which is a central issue in leading agricultural production after the harvest. Therefore, grain procurement work must be directly combined with the work of organizing and leading production, which is conducive to completing the grain procurement task and satisfying the peasants' desire to sell surplus grain to develop production and improve their lives. The typical report on Ge Xinnian, Deputy Chief of Chang'an Township, Zhangye County, organizing peasants to expand production and sell surplus grain, published by the newspaper on October 16, specifically introduced the practice of combining grain procurement with organizing peasant production with actual examples. After accepting the state's grain procurement task, Ge Xinnian, Deputy Chief of Chang'an Township, on the one hand, publicized the grain procurement policy to the peasants and mobilized them to sell their surplus grain to the state; on the other hand, he held his own family meeting to discuss the production issues for the next year. After careful calculation, the whole family agreed to sell the surplus grain to the state and buy back twenty sheep to accumulate manure for fertilization, and quickly realized this plan after the meeting. This led the village to set off a wave of selling surplus grain to purchase draft animals, carts, and other farm tools. The 26 households in the village sold more than 16,000 jin of surplus grain in August and September alone, of which 11 households made 9 new iron-wheeled carts with the money from selling grain, 5 households bought 5 heads of livestock, and another 5 households asked to go to Qinghai to buy livestock, and the enthusiasm of the masses for production was very high. Subsequently, the newspaper successively reported the situation of peasants in Chaoyuan Township, Dayou District, Zhangye County, Sixth District and Third Township, Shandan County, and other places purchasing means of production after selling surplus grain, actively turning the land and accumulating manure, and preparing to expand production next year. For example, after selling surplus grain, the peasants in the Sixth District and Third Township of Shandan County made 26 iron-wheeled carts, 5 wooden carts, bought 178 iron hoes and 250 sickles, added 7 draft animals, and built 50 new houses. The peasants in the whole township used iron hoes to dig more than 587 mu of land. Wei Youzhi, a peasant who did not turn the land in the past, also turned more than 7 mu of land this year. These reports prove that as long as grain procurement work is well combined with the work of organizing peasant production, it will not only not affect the peasants' production mood, but also improve the peasants' enthusiasm for production and encourage the peasants' enthusiasm for selling surplus grain.
    Since grain procurement work must be combined with production work, it is necessary to meet the peasants' needs for means of production and means of living as much as possible. This is an important economic work in grain procurement. Doing a good job in the supply of materials, especially the supply of means of production, can encourage and guide peasants to invest the cash earned from selling grain in expanding reproduction. The Gansu Daily conducted relatively full publicity on the work of supplying materials. The survey report on the grain sales of peasants in Wangjia Village, Hedong Township, Wuwei County, published by the newspaper on October 9, pointed out the importance of strengthening the supply of materials in grain procurement, based on the situation of peasants in Wangjia Village selling grain to exchange for means of production and means of living after the summer harvest, and the fact that the peasants in the village were willing to travel a long way to sell grain in the city because the supply and marketing cooperatives in the vicinity did not do a good job in the supply work. Later, the newspaper successively reported the activities of party and government leading organs and cooperation and trade departments at all levels taking various measures to actively strengthen the supply of materials. For example, party committees and governments at all levels in Wuwei Prefecture sent a large number of cadres to the countryside to strengthen the leadership of grain procurement and material supply work. Material exchange conferences were held throughout Wuwei and Jiuquan prefectures, purchasing grain on the one hand and supplying peasants with materials on the other. Supply and marketing cooperatives in many districts of Wuwei County also implemented a reservation registration method, allowing peasants to sell grain to the state first, and then the cooperatives supply the materials they need according to the peasants' needs. Through these reports, the newspaper not only emphasized the importance of strengthening the supply of materials, but also promoted many good experiences. Among them, what is particularly worth mentioning is the newspaper's publicity on organizing handicraft goods sources and improving supply methods. In terms of organizing handicraft goods sources, the editorial department of the newspaper held a forum on organizing handicraft production to supply peasants' materials on October 12, pointing out that organizing handicraft processing and manufacturing and supplying on the spot is an effective method to open up sources of goods and further meet the needs of grain-selling peasants for means of production and means of living. In order to attract the attention of various places, the newspaper successively published news about Wuwei, Jiuquan, Tianshui, and other prefectures strengthening the leadership of handicraft production, and at the same time reported examples of various places solving the problem of material supply better due to actively opening up handicraft goods sources. On October 18, it was reported that the Shuangchengbao Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Wuwei County processed orders from handicraftsmen, purchased locally, and supplied 19 kinds of goods needed by peasants, which not only guaranteed the supply, but also was welcomed by peasants because of the low cost and cheap price, and also supported the local handicraft production. On December 16, it was also reported that the Yongdeng County Cooperative Union organized handicraft processing and ordering according to the needs of peasants, and supplied a large number of means of production and means of living to peasants. In the third quarter of this year, the means of production supplied by the cooperative to the peasants in the county reached 13,767 pieces, of which 10,002 pieces were processed and ordered locally, and only 3,765 pieces were imported from outside. This pointed out an important way to solve the problem of material supply. In terms of improving the method of material supply, the newspaper focused on introducing the practice of organizing mobile trade groups and peddlers to go deep into the countryside for procurement and supply in order to take care of the convenience of peasants in busy farming seasons and remote areas to sell grain and buy goods. The newspaper's reports on mobile trade groups in Huixian, Jingyuan, and Gangu counties purchasing, supplying, and publicizing at the same time used concrete and vivid facts to illustrate that this practice greatly increased the amount of grain purchased and goods sold, and was warmly welcomed by peasants. Many peasants automatically helped the mobile trade groups to move goods, broadcast on the roof, and mobilized everyone to sell grain and buy goods. At the same time, it also introduced the practice of some trade groups conducting investigations on the rural economy and the materials needed by peasants in conjunction with business operations, which not only completed the task of grain procurement, but also established extensive purchase and sale relations with peasants.
    In addition to doing a good job in the supply of materials in grain procurement, it is also necessary to actively develop rural savings and do a good job in recovering agricultural loans. These are also important economic tasks to guide peasants to rationally use the money from selling grain, which is conducive to expanding production next year. The Gansu Daily timely paid attention to encouraging peasants to save and repay agricultural loans in its grain procurement publicity. The newspaper published a short commentary entitled "Develop Patriotic Savings Work" on November 12, clarifying the principle that saving is beneficial to both the country and the individual, and pointed out that advocating savings is not to reduce everyone's living standards, but to help everyone use savings in a planned way to develop production and improve personal life. The newspaper also successively reported that the Lingtai County Dudian Business Office of the People's Bank of China tried out rural savings and received good results, and that peasants in Tianshui, Zhangye, and other counties enthusiastically deposited money in the People's Bank of China and credit cooperatives to accumulate funds for production next year. For example, after the People's Bank of China tried out rural savings in Guanzi District, Tianshui County, it saved 22.06 million yuan in less than ten days. Dong Jianguo, a peasant in Shizuizi Village, heard the propaganda of patriotic savings and deposited more than 3 million yuan, which he had prepared to buy livestock in the future, into the bank, and then deposited another 500,000 yuan, and said to people: "I turned over with the Communist Party, I believe in the words of the Communist Party, it is okay to take the money out of the bank at any time, it is safe, it earns interest, and it can develop production in a planned way." Under his leadership, some peasants in the village also deposited the cash they earned from selling grain that was temporarily unused into the bank. For example, the Jing'anbao Credit Cooperative in Zhangye County loaned 160 million yuan in the first three quarters of this year to help peasants solve production difficulties. Local peasants realized the benefits of the credit cooperative and deposited the money they earned from selling grain that was temporarily unused into the credit cooperative, saving 5.92 million yuan in just three days. Through these examples, the newspaper educated peasants to correctly use the money they earned from selling grain that was temporarily unused, neither should they spend it indiscriminately, nor should they blindly rush to buy materials in the market, but should accumulate production funds in a planned way. On the other hand, the Gansu Daily did not ignore the publicity of the work of recovering agricultural loans. In addition to publishing a special article on November 6, pointing out that recovering agricultural loans is not only an important task in the current rural financial work, but also directly related to the continued issuance of agricultural loans next year, it also successively reflected the activities of peasants in various places enthusiastically repaying state loans after realizing the great role of agricultural loans in developing agricultural production from their own experiences. For example, after the government's propaganda and mobilization, peasants in the Eighth Township of Hebei District, Jiuquan County, paid back 93% of various overdue loans within seven days. Peasants in Xinba District, Gaotai County, paid back 95% of various overdue loans within fifteen days. Qiao Shiying, a peasant in Yumen County, said: "The people's government sent the money to our doorsteps in the spring to help us solve great difficulties; now that the grain has been harvested, we should automatically pay back the loans to the bank." This shows that as long as peasants are educated to realize that repaying agricultural loans on time is not only the responsibility of peasants, but also beneficial to all peasants, they will, according to their own abilities, actively invest the money from selling grain in expanding reproduction on the one hand, and enthusiastically repay agricultural loans on the other hand, so that the country can provide more powerful support for agricultural production in the future.
    The Gansu Daily emphasized that grain procurement work must be combined with production work, and paid great attention to economic work in grain procurement, which encouraged the peasants' enthusiasm for selling grain and production enthusiasm in an important aspect, and effectively guided peasants to make reasonable arrangements for the money earned from selling grain. But it is not to say that the newspaper's publicity on economic work has no shortcomings, nor is it to say that the newspaper only needs to pay attention to economic work in grain procurement. Although the Gansu Daily also paid attention to conducting political education for peasants in its grain procurement reports, and reflected the patriotic actions of peasants in various places who enthusiastically sold surplus grain to the state after their political awareness was raised through propaganda and education; it should be pointed out that the newspaper's publicity in this regard was relatively weak in the previous period. Since December, with the in-depth development of grain procurement work, the Gansu Daily, in addition to continuing to pay attention to reporting the combination of grain procurement and production, as well as economic work in grain procurement, has particularly strengthened the education of peasants on the general line and the socialist future, which is absolutely necessary. In-depth education on the general line, so that peasants understand that the current grain procurement policy is an indispensable part of the general line, can make the peasants' actions of selling surplus grain become more consciously supporting the country's socialist industrialization, and guide the peasants to more firmly embark on the road of mutual assistance and cooperation.

    把购粮工作和发展生产结合起来
    何辛
    为了完成粮食收购的任务，同时达到农业增产的目的，除必须向农民群众深入宣传国家过渡时期的总路线和购粮政策以提高农民的政治觉悟外，还必须做好各项经济工作，以实现农民出售余粮扩大生产的要求。甘肃日报在购粮报道中，除宣传了农民把余粮卖给国家对于支持国家建设，巩固工农联盟和稳定市场物价的关系外，对购粮中的经济工作给予了很大的重视，这是十分必要的。
    甘肃日报从九月份以来即对购粮工作进行了突出的宣传。在这一宣传中该报着重指出了国家收购粮食与农民出售余粮以扩大再生产的要求的一致性，强调购粮工作必须与组织农民生产的工作相结合，并大力传播了这方面的成功经验。例如该报自九月中旬起连续发表的中共武威地委书记徐宗望、地委委员周化南、武威专区合作办事处副主任王福等负责干部所写的论文和通讯，就比较系统地介绍了武威专区的购粮工作经验；这个经验是：根据小农经济为买而卖的购销特点，从组织农民进行生产和安排经济生活入手，通过商品交换，来完成粮食收购任务，并进一步扩大农业生产。武威地委书记徐宗望在他所写的论文中，着重地说明了购粮工作和生产工作的关系，即农村的中心工作是生产工作，购粮工作一方面是要为国家收购必需的粮食，另一方面是为了替农民的余粮找最好的出路，并帮助农民有效地运用余粮，以扩大生产，这正是收获以后领导农业生产的一个中心问题。因此购粮工作必须与组织领导生产的工作直接结合起来，这样既有利于完成购粮任务，又能满足农民出售余粮以发展生产和改善生活的要求。该报十月十六日发表的张掖县长安乡副乡长葛新年组织农民扩大生产出售余粮的典型报道，更以实际事例具体地介绍了将购粮工作与组织农民生产结合起来的作法。长安乡副乡长葛新年在接受了国家的购粮任务之后，一面向农民宣传购粮政策，动员农民把余粮卖给国家；一面召开自己的家庭会议，讨论了明年的生产问题。经过算细账，全家同意将余粮卖给国家，买回二十只羊攒粪积肥，会后并很快地实现了这个计划。这样就带动了全村农民掀起出售余粮以添置耕畜、大车及其他农具的热潮。该村的二十六户人家，仅在八、九两月即出售余粮一万六千多斤，其中十一户以粮款做了九辆新铁轮车，五户买了五头牲口，还有五户要求到青海去买牲口，群众的生产热情十分高涨。接着该报又陆续报道了张掖县大有区朝元乡、山丹县六区三乡及其他各地农民将余粮卖给国家后购置生产资料、积极翻地积肥、准备明年扩大生产的情况。如山丹县六区三乡农民出售余粮后共做铁轮车二十六辆、木车五辆，买铁铣一百七十八张、镰刀二百五十张，增添耕畜七头，新修房子五十间。全乡农民用铁铣挖地五百八十七亩多，以往不翻地的农民魏有志，今年也翻地七亩多。这些报道证明：只要将购粮工作与组织农民生产的工作很好地结合起来，不但不会影响农民的生产情绪，而且会提高农民的生产积极性，并鼓舞农民出售余粮的热情。
    既然必须将购粮工作和生产工作结合起来，就必须尽可能地满足农民对生产资料和生活资料的需要。这是购粮中的一项重要的经济工作。做好了物资供应特别是生产资料的供应，就能鼓励和引导农民将卖粮所得的现款投资于扩大再生产。甘肃日报对于物资供应工作进行了比较充分的宣传。该报十月九日发表的武威县河东乡王家村农民售粮情况的调查报告，就以王家村农民在夏收后出卖粮食换取生产资料和生活资料的情况，以及该村农民因为附近的供销合作社供应工作做得不好，宁愿远道进城粜粮的事实，指出了购粮中加强物资供应的重要性。以后该报又先后报道了各地党政领导机关及合作、贸易部门采取各种措施积极加强物资供应的活动。如武威专区各级党委和政府曾派大批干部深入农村，加强对购粮和物资供应工作的领导。武威及酒泉专区各地普遍召开物资交流大会，一面收购粮食，一面供应农民物资。武威县许多区的供销合作社还实行预约登记办法，让农民先把粮食卖给国家，合作社再根据农民的需要供应其所需的物资。报纸通过这些报道，不仅强调了加强物资供应的重要性，而且推广了不少好的经验。其中特别值得提出的，是该报关于组织手工业货源和改进供应方法的宣传。在组织手工业货源方面，该报编辑部曾在十月十二日召开关于组织手工业生产供应农民物资的座谈会，指出组织手工业加工制造，就地供应，是当前开辟货源、进一步满足售粮农民对生产资料和生活资料需要的有效方法。该报为引起各地重视，先后发表了武威、酒泉、天水等专区加强对手工业生产领导的消息，同时报道了各地由于积极开辟手工业货源因而更好地解决了物资供应问题的事例。十月十八日就曾报道了武威县双城堡供销合作社向手工业者加工订货，就地采购，供应了农民所需的十九种货品，不仅保证了供应，而且因为成本低、价钱便宜而受到农民的欢迎，还扶植了当地的手工业生产。十二月十六日又报道了永登县合作社联合社根据农民需要，组织手工业加工订货，大量供应农民生产资料和生活资料，今年第三季度，由合作社供应全县农民的生产工具达一万三千七百六十七件，其中就地加工订货的就占一万零二件，外进的只有三千七百六十五件。这就为解决物资供应问题指出了一个重要的途径。在改进物资供应方法方面，该报着重介绍了各地为照顾农忙及边远地区农民卖粮买货的方便，组织流动贸易组、货郎担深入农村进行收购和供应的作法。该报对徽县、靖远、甘谷等县流动贸易组边收购、边供应、边宣传的报道，都用具体生动的事实说明这种作法大大提高了购粮和卖货额，得到农民的热烈欢迎。许多农民自动帮助流动贸易组搬货，到屋顶广播，动员大家来卖粮买货。同时又介绍了有些贸易组结合营业对农村经济情况和农民所需物资进行调查的作法，这样既完成了购粮任务，又和农民建立了广泛的购销关系。
    在粮食收购中除必须做好物资供应工作外，还要积极开展农村储蓄并做好收回农业贷款的工作。这些也是引导农民合理运用卖粮款项，使之有利于扩大明年生产的重要的经济工作。甘肃日报在购粮宣传中及时地注意了鼓励农民节约储蓄及归还农贷。该报曾于十一月十二日发表“开展爱国储蓄工作”的短评，阐明了节约储蓄既有利于国家又有利于个人的道理，指出提倡储蓄并不是要大家降低生活水平，而是帮助大家有计划地运用积蓄，发展生产和改善个人生活。该报并先后报道了人民银行灵台县独店营业所试办农村储蓄收到良好效果及天水、张掖等县农民踊跃向人民银行和信贷合作社存款，积蓄明年生产资金的情况。如天水县关子区农民在人民银行试办农村储蓄后，不到十天就存储了二千二百零六万元。该区石嘴子村农民董建国听了爱国储蓄的宣传后，就把准备以后买牲口用的三百多万元存入银行，随后又存入五十万元，并对人说：“我靠共产党翻的身，我信服共产党的话，把钱放到银行里啥时候取都行，又保险，又得利息，又能有计划地发展生产。”在他带动下，该村有些农民也都纷纷把卖粮所得暂时不用的现款存入银行。又如张掖县靖安堡信贷合作社今年前三季共贷款一亿六千万元，帮助农民解决生产困难。当地农民认识到信贷社的好处，纷纷将卖粮所得暂时不用的钱存入信贷合作社，仅三天即储蓄五百九十二万元。报纸通过这些事例，教育农民正确地使用卖粮所得暂时不用的款项，既不应胡乱花掉，也不要到市场上盲目抢购物资，而应该有计划地积蓄生产资金。在另一方面，甘肃日报也没有忽视对收回农贷的工作的宣传。该报除于十一月六日发表专文，指出收回农贷不仅是当前农村金融工作中的重要任务，而且直接关系着明年农业贷款的继续发放外，还陆续反映了各地农民从切身体验中认识到农业贷款对发展农业生产的巨大作用后踊跃归还国家贷款的活动。如酒泉县河北区八乡农民经过政府宣传动员后，在七天内就缴还了各项到期贷款百分之九十三。高台县新坝区农民在十五天内缴还了各项到期贷款百分之九十五。玉门县农民乔世英说：“人民政府在春天把款送到门上，帮助我们解决了大困难；现在粮食收下了，应该自动地给银行缴回贷款。”这说明了，只要教育农民认识到期归还农贷不仅是农民应有的责任，而且对全体农民有好处，他们就会根据自己的能力，一方面将卖粮款项积极投入扩大再生产，另一方面踊跃归还农贷，以便国家今后对农业生产给予更有力的支援。
    甘肃日报强调购粮工作必须与生产工作相结合，对购粮中的经济工作给予了很大的注意，这就在一个重要的方面鼓舞了农民的卖粮热情和生产积极性，并有力地指导了农民将卖粮所得的款项作合理的安排。但并不是说该报对经济工作的宣传就没有缺点，更不是说报纸只注意购粮中的经济工作就可以了。甘肃日报在购粮报道中虽然也注意了对农民进行政治教育，并反映了各地农民经过宣传教育后政治觉悟提高、踊跃将余粮卖给国家的爱国行动；但应该指出，该报在前一个时期对这一方面的宣传是比较薄弱的。十二月份以来，随着购粮工作的深入开展，甘肃日报除继续注意报道购粮与生产的结合以及购粮中的经济工作外，特别加强了对农民进行总路线和社会主义前途的教育，这是完全必要的。深入总路线的教育，让农民懂得现时的购粮政策是总路线的一个不可缺少的组成部分，就能够使农民出售余粮的行动成为更加自觉地支持国家社会主义工业化的行动，并引导农民更坚决地走上互助合作的道路。
