Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 10th: The delegations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China participating in the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference issued the following communique:

    The twenty-first meeting of the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference was held on December 10th.

    The U.S. representative, Dean, continued to delay the bilateral talks with slanders against the Korean-Chinese side and the Soviet Union, and refused to engage in serious discussions.

    Our representative, Mr. Ki Sok-bok, spoke, illustrating in a comparative manner that our proposal is reasonable and feasible, and rebuked the other side's so-called proposal as merely facilitating the other side's sabotage of the bilateral talks, and that it fundamentally cannot serve as the basis for a bilateral agreement. Mr. Ki Sok-bok also made a comparative analysis of the voting methods proposed by both sides, specifically regarding Dean's so-called "unit voting procedure." Mr. Ki Sok-bok pointed out that our proposal, under the principle of unanimous agreement between both sides, every country on both sides should participate in voting equally. In a reciprocal meeting where each side has more than two countries participating, this is the only feasible, serious, and responsible voting method. This is because only after every country on both sides has voted and expressed its opinion, and unanimous agreement of all countries on both sides has been reached, can a true agreement be obtained. An agreement reached in this way will have true binding force on all countries on both sides. Moreover, such a voting method can also test whether the other side has the sincerity to reach an agreement and abide by the agreement, so as to prevent the resolution of the political conference from becoming a deception and farce that the other side is attempting to create. According to the other side's voting method, if any one of the countries on the other side disagrees with the agreement reached by the other side with us through unit voting, then it will not be bound by the agreement. This shows that the other side is precisely attempting to overturn the principle of unanimous agreement and reserve room for certain members of the other side to violate the agreement. The other side claims that the countries on its side are sovereign states and should have the freedom to express their opinions, but the so-called unit voting method advocated by the other side is precisely a conspiracy by the United States to undermine the sovereignty of these countries, attempt to deprive them of their right to vote, and force them to submit to the will of the United States.

    Finally, Mr. Ki Sok-bok once again earnestly advised the other side that if the other side still has the sincerity to resolve the issue through negotiation, it should change its unreasonable and arrogant attitude, discard its delaying and deceptive tactics, and honestly return to serious discussions.

    关于政治会议问题的双方会谈举行第二十一次会议
    我方指出美方建议不能成为双方协议的基础
    【新华社开城十日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国参加关于政治会议问题双方会谈的代表团发表公报如下：
    十二月十日，关于政治会议问题的双方会谈举行第二十一次会议。
    美方代表迪安继续以对朝中方面和苏联的诬蔑拖延双方会谈，拒绝进行认真的讨论。
    我方代表奇石福先生发言，以对比方式说明我方的建议是合理可行的，斥责对方的所谓建议只是便利对方破坏双方会谈，根本不能成为双方达成协议的基础。奇石福先生并针对迪安的所谓“单位表决程序”，特别就两方面所提出的表决办法作了比较分析。奇石福先生指出我方建议在双方一致同意的原则之下，双方的每一个国家应一律参加投票，在一个每方有两个以上国家参加的双方对等的会议中，这是唯一可行的、严肃负责的表决方法，因为只有双方的每一个国家都投票表示了意见，达到了双方所有国家一致同意之后才能取得真正的协议，而这样达成的协议，对双方所有国家也才有真正的约束力，而且这样的表决办法也可以考验对方是否有达成协议与遵守协议的诚意，不致使政治会议的决议成为对方所企图造成的一种欺骗与滑稽戏；按照对方的表决方法，对方以单位投票方法与我方所达成的协议对方中的任何一国如不同意，那么它就可不受该协议的约束，这说明对方正是企图推翻双方一致同意的原则，而替对方的某些成员破坏协议预留地步。对方自称对方的国家为主权国家，应有其表达意见的自由，但对方所主张的所谓单位表决办法，正是美国破坏各该国的主权，企图剥夺各该国家的表决权，而使它们屈从美国意志的一种阴谋。
    最后，奇石福先生再一次郑重劝告对方，如果对方尚有协商解决问题的诚意，就应该改变其横蛮无理的态度，丢弃其拖延欺骗的手段，而老老实实回到认真的讨论上来。
