Starting with “A Civil Official Doesn’t Love Money”
    Ding San

"A civil official doesn't love money" used to be considered a virtue in old China. In the "those who steal a country become lords," with corrupt officials everywhere, if someone genuinely "didn't love money," if they were "unmoved" by shiny gold, silver, or colorful banknotes, and consequently handled official business more fairly, then that was considered truly rare and valuable. Of course, the "money" we're talking about here is all private wealth; the "civil officials" of that time had no concept of public property at all. But in our new China, the situation is different. Corruption is a crime, and protecting public property for the people's cause is an unadulterated virtue.

Some say: many leading comrades in the cultural and educational system don't know how to manage money. This is a fact. Not knowing how to manage money is a consequence of not managing money, and not managing money is a concrete manifestation of not cherishing public property. Tracing the ideological roots, this may be somewhat related to the influence of personal "aloofness" from the old society. Some comrades may smell a whiff of "vulgarity" when money is mentioned.

This is wrong. Work suffers considerably as a result. The result of not liking to manage money or not knowing how to manage money is that it not only causes waste but also makes it impossible to pinpoint where the waste is occurring, and therefore impossible to know how to eliminate the waste. For leading comrades, "managing money" is not specialized accounting, but an important part of the art of work. To use the money that should be used appropriately, one must not only understand the guidelines and policies, and understand finance, but also understand the "bottom line" of actual work. It is only by using money rationally based on this "bottom line" that money can play its proper role. That's what it means to know how to manage money.

Another manifestation of not cherishing public property is looking down on "bits and pieces." Some say: do cultural and educational institutions also need to economize? As an honest department, even if we economize, what's the use of the bits and pieces saved! This is also wrong. Are they really just bits and pieces? According to preliminary investigations, the budgets of individual units in the cultural and educational system almost exceed actual needs by a factor of two. Some units disregard staffing and budgets, emphasize pomp and circumstance, and build houses without careful calculation; some even overspend by more than 10 billion. Teaching instruments, medical instruments, medicines, equipment, etc., are stockpiled in amounts of tens of millions, hundreds of millions, or even more than a billion. Are these just bits and pieces? Even if they really are just bits and pieces, since they are wasteful, they must be reversed. This is not just a matter of money, but also a matter of people's ideology and work style. We must build a socialist society, and we must cultivate the good habits and qualities that builders of such a society should have, and cultivate a socialist atmosphere of frugality. Soviet experts can't bear to waste even a piece of chalk, and this is a good example for us.

Saving is not simply saving money. If the money that should be used is used appropriately, even if it's hundreds of billions, it's not considered waste; if it's not used appropriately, even bits and pieces are waste. The dividing line between saving and waste, between loving money and not loving money, lies here. The thinking of a "miser" who values money like life and the lifestyle of a lavish young master are both caricatures of socialism.

    从“文官不爱钱”说起
    丁三
    “文官不爱钱”在旧中国算是一种美德。在“窃国者侯”、贪官如毛的“官场”，真有谁“不爱钱”，对闪亮的金银或花花绿绿的钞票，“无动于中”，因而办起公事来，比较公道些，那总算是难能可贵的了。自然，这里说的“钱”，都是私财，那时的“文官”们根本没有公共财产的观念。但在咱们新中国，情况就不同了。贪污是犯罪的，而为人民的事业而爱护公共财产，正是不折不扣的美德。
    有人说：文教系统不少领导同志不会管钱。这是事实。不会管钱是不管钱的后果，而不管钱则是不爱护公共财产的具体表现。论起思想根源来，这也许跟那旧社会的个人“清高”的影响有点关系。有些同志，一提起钱，也许会闻到一股“俗气”。
    这是错误。工作因此受到不少损失。不爱管钱或不会管钱的结果，不但要引起浪费，而且摸不清浪费所在，因而不知道怎样消灭浪费。对领导同志来说，“管钱”不是专门的会计学，而是工作艺术的重要部分。要把该用的钱用得适当，不但要懂得方针、政策，懂得财务，而且要摸清实际工作的“底”。根据这个“底”来合理使用钱，钱才能发挥应有的作用。这才叫做会管钱。
    不爱护公共财产的另一个表现，就是看不起“星星点点”。有人说：文教机关也要节约吗？清水衙门，节约起来，星星点点，有什么用处！这也是错误。真是星星点点吗？据初步调查，文教系统个别单位的预算几乎超过实际需要的一倍。有些单位不顾编制和预算，讲排场，摆场面，造房子不精打细算，有的竟超支一百多亿。教学仪器、医疗仪器、药品、器材等等，一积压便是几千万、几万万、甚至十多亿。难道这些都是星星点点吗？即便真是星星点点吧，既属浪费，也得反掉才好。这不仅是钱的问题，而且是人的思想作风问题。我们一定要建设社会主义社会，必须养成这样社会的建设者应有的好习惯、好品质，养成社会主义的节约风气。苏联专家连一个粉笔头都舍不得浪费掉，这是我们的好榜样。
    节约不是单纯省钱。该用的钱用得适当，千亿万亿，也不算浪费；用得不适当，星星点点，也是浪费。节约与浪费、爱钱与不爱钱的界线，便在这里。一钱如命的“守财奴”思想，挥金如土的阔少爷作风，都是对社会主义的讽刺。
