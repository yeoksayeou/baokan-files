(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 4th) The spokesman of the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China participating in the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference today issued a statement on the current situation of the bilateral talks as follows:

The bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference currently being held in Panmunjom have encountered significant difficulties, and the convening of the political conference is facing increasing delays. These difficulties are entirely caused by the artificial delaying tactics adopted by the US negotiating representatives. The people of the world should know the truth.

As the world knows, the comprehensive proposal on the political conference put forward by the Korean-Chinese delegation on November 30th was a major effort by the Korean-Chinese side to promote an agreement based on fairness and reason in the bilateral talks, which would be conducive to the early convening of the political conference. This proposal stipulates that the Korean political conference should be held in New Delhi, India, on December 28, 1953, and the conference will take the form of an equal meeting between the two parties to the Korean Armistice Agreement, inviting five relevant neutral countries to participate. It put forward clear, reasonable, and practical plans for each of the five agenda items of the bilateral talks. It fairly considered the various arguments put forward by the US side in the month since the bilateral talks began, thus largely dispelling the US side's objections to the previous proposals of the Korean-Chinese side. Therefore, after this comprehensive proposal was put forward, it was immediately warmly welcomed by world public opinion. The Korean-Chinese negotiating representatives and the peace-loving people of the world have the right to demand that the US negotiating representatives quickly adopt a positive attitude at the conference table to seriously discuss this proposal. However, for the past four days, the performance of the US negotiating representative, Dean, has been completely contrary to people's expectations. On the one hand, he refused to answer the fundamental questions raised in the Korean-Chinese proposal, and on the other hand, he distorted the Korean-Chinese proposal to create unnecessary disputes, in order to delay the bilateral talks and prevent the early convening of the Korean political conference eagerly awaited by the world.

The crux of the current dispute between the two sides is the issue of neutral countries participating in the political conference. The Korean-Chinese proposal of November 30th clearly stated that in order to promote and guarantee the smooth progress of the political conference, the political conference should invite the Soviet Union, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Burma to participate as members of the political conference, but not belonging to either side. To this suggestion, the US side has so far evaded making a positive response, while continuing to talk nonsense that the Soviet Union should participate in the political conference as one of the belligerent parties in Korea. This nonsense on the part of the US side not only completely obliterates the fact that the Soviet Union has always maintained neutrality in the Korean War, but also overthrows the agreement between the two sides in Article 37 of the Armistice Agreement, which defines neutral countries as "countries that have not had combat troops participating in hostilities in Korea." Even Dean, in his speech on November 28th, had to admit that the Soviet Union was a third party other than the two belligerent parties in Korea, but he still unreasonably insisted that the Soviet Union was not a neutral country. The US side's approach is clearly intended to drag the bilateral talks into endless disputes.

Another important dispute in the bilateral talks is the issue of the authority of neutral countries in the political conference. In this regard, the comprehensive proposal of the Korean-Chinese side has already made concessions on two points, agreeing that neutral countries should conduct discussions according to the agenda items determined by agreement between the two sides, and that no voting should take place in the political conference or its subsidiary organs. In view of the fact that its past excuses for opposing the participation of neutral countries as members of the political conference have been removed, the US side has resorted directly to the trick of distorting the wording of our proposal, fancifully interpreting the phrase "either country has different opinions, it should continue to negotiate" in our proposal as meaning that if any neutral country has different opinions, the two sides cannot vote to make a decision, and based on this, it put forward an "opposition" that has no target in reality. Of course, this argument profoundly reveals the US side's strong fear that the participation of neutral countries will hinder it from sabotaging the political conference. But the matter is so obvious that if we cannot underestimate Mr. Dean's language knowledge, we cannot but think that the US side is making something out of nothing, deliberately looking for trouble.

On the issue of the agenda of the political conference, the US side's attitude is even more absurd. Our proposal for the agenda of the political conference should be:
	A.	Prisoner of War Issue;
	B.	The issue of the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea;
	C.	Peaceful Settlement of the Korean Question;
	D.	Other related issues. Here, "other related issues" naturally refers to issues related to the Korean issue involved in the course of the meeting. For such a self-evident question, Dean was able to talk nonsense about "relativity," saying that our side "is applying the principles of modern relativity," and Dean's understanding of relativity is that "everything, whether in politics or physics, is infinitely related to everything else," so according to Dean, suggesting to discuss "other related issues" is equivalent to making the Korean political conference "discuss anything," which will make this conference become "a car without brakes, gears, or speed controls." Needless to say, this statement is by no means a serious discussion of the issue, but purely unreasonable trouble-making.

Even on the administrative proposals put forward by our side on the issue of publishing communiques and news interviews, based on the precedents that have long been recognized and followed by both sides in the military armistice negotiations, Dean, disregarding the fact that he can hardly find decent reasons, has also tried his best to express his opposition.

The Korean-Chinese delegation believes that everyone with judgment will never think from the above large number of facts that the US representative still has any sincerity at the negotiating table in Panmunjom. There can only be one explanation for the behavior of the US representative, that is, they want to postpone the opening date of the political conference as much as possible, past January 22 next year, their so-called deadline for the detention of prisoners of war. On this point, Dean has already revealed the truth in his speech on December 2, in which he tried his best to wash himself clean. Dean said: "If the political conference is in session between December 22 and January 22, then, according to the first sentence of Article 11 of the terms of reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the issue of prisoners of war should be discussed." Here, Dean wants to smuggle in an argument, as if the political conference, if convened after January 22, can no longer discuss the issue of prisoners of war, as if the prisoners of war who have not been repatriated by that time can automatically change their status without discussion at the political conference, as the US side has consistently unilaterally propagated. In this way, Dean has confirmed with his own speech the Korean-Chinese side's argument: the US side is attempting to avoid the political conference in order to realize its consistent conspiracy to forcibly detain the captured personnel of the Korean-Chinese side through unilateral actions. Dean's stubborn refusal of our proposal that the political conference should be held on December 28, and his demand to replace it with a formula that is indefinitely distant, further confirms this argument.

The Korean-Chinese delegation believes that it has a responsibility to remind the people of the world to be vigilant against this conspiracy of the US side, which is obviously trying to delay the Korean political conference. The Korean-Chinese side has always sincerely wished to reach an agreement with the US side quickly on a fair and reasonable basis, so that the political conference can be convened as soon as possible, and the Korean issue can be resolved peacefully as soon as possible. However, our good wishes can only be realized if the other side is willing to adopt a consultative attitude to solve the problem. If the other side stubbornly delays the negotiations and insists on making unreasonable trouble, then an agreement can hardly be reached by our side's unilateral sincerity alone. The comprehensive proposal now put forward by the Korean-Chinese side is a serious test of whether the US side has sincerity. However, for the past four days, the US side has not only failed to adopt any positive attitude, but has instead intensified its use of evasion, delay, distortion, and slander to refuse to conduct serious consultation. Our side solemnly demands that the US side immediately abandon this means. The Armistice Agreement must not be violated, the political conference must not be delayed, and the peace aspirations of the people of the world must not be trifled with. If the US side continues to act willfully, it will not be able to escape its full responsibility for delaying the negotiations, and will bear all the consequences arising therefrom.

    参加关于政治会议问题会谈的我方代表团发言人
    就目前双方会谈形势发表声明
    揭露美方变本加厉地拖延政治会议的阴谋
    【新华社开城四日电】参加关于政治会议问题双方会谈的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国代表团发言人，今天就目前双方会谈形势发表声明如下：
    现在板门店举行的关于政治会议问题的双方会谈已遭到重大困难，政治会议的召开已有愈来愈推延之势。这种困难是由美方谈判代表采取人为的拖延政策所一手造成的。世界人民应知真相。
    举世周知，朝中代表团在十一月三十日提出的关于政治会议的全面建议，乃是朝中方面为推动双方会谈在公平合理的基础上达成协议，以利政治会议早日召开而作的重大努力。这个建议规定朝鲜政治会议应于一九五三年十二月二十八日在印度新德里召开，会议将采取朝鲜停战协定缔约双方对等会议的形式，而邀请五个有关中立国家参加。它对双方会谈五项议程中的每一项都提出了明确合理与切实可行的方案。它公平地考虑到了双方会谈一个月以来美方所提出的各项论点，因而在很大程度上解除了美方对朝中方面以往各项建议的反对。因此，这个全面建议提出以后，立刻受到世界舆论的热烈欢迎。朝中谈判代表与全世界爱好和平的人民，有权利要求美国谈判代表在会议桌上迅速采取积极态度对这一建议进行认真的讨论。但是四天以来，美方谈判代表迪安的表现却与人们的期望完全相反。他一面拒绝回答朝中建议中所提出的根本性的问题，一面歪曲朝中建议来制造不必要的争论，以拖延双方会谈，使举世渴望的朝鲜政治会议不能早日召开。
    目前双方争论的症结是中立国参加政治会议的问题。十一月三十日的朝中建议明确提出：为推动和保证政治会议的顺利进行，政治会议应邀请苏联、印度、印度尼西亚、巴基斯坦和缅甸五个中立国家参加，作为政治会议的成员，但不属于双方的任何一方。对于这一建议，美方一面至今逃避作出正面的答复，一面继续胡说苏联应作为朝鲜交战双方的一方参加政治会议。美方这种胡说不但完全抹煞了苏联在朝鲜战争中始终保持中立的事实，而且推翻了双方在停战协定第三十七款中把中立国定义定为“未有战斗部队参加在朝鲜的敌对行为的国家”的协议。甚至迪安在十一月二十八日的发言中，也不得不承认苏联为朝鲜交战双方以外的第三者，但是他却仍然无理坚持苏联不是中立国。美方这种做法，显然是要把双方会谈拖进无休止的争论中去。
    双方会谈中的另一个重要争端是关于中立国在政治会议中的权限这一问题。对此，朝中方面的全面建议已在两点上作了让步，同意中立国按照双方协议确定的议程项目来进行讨论，并在政治会议或其附属机构中不进行表决。美方鉴于其过去反对中立国作为成员参加政治会议的藉口已被解除，竟直接诉之于曲解我方建议的文字的把戏，把我方建议中所说双方“任何一国如有不同意见，应即继续进行协商”一语，异想天开地解释成为任何一个中立国如有不同意见，双方即不能进行表决作出决定，并据以提出实际上是没有对象的“反对”。当然，这种论调深刻地透露了美方害怕中立国的参加将妨碍它破坏政治会议的强烈恐惧。但是事情是如此明显，如果我们不能过低估计迪安先生的语言知识，我们就不能不认为美方是在无中生有，蓄意寻衅。
    在关于政治会议议程的问题上，美方的态度甚至更加荒唐。我方建议政治会议的议程应为：
  甲、战俘问题；
    乙、从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队问题；
    丙、和平解决朝鲜问题；
    丁、其他有关问题。在这里“其他有关问题”自然是指会议进行中涉及的与朝鲜问题有关的问题。对于这样一个不言自明的问题，迪安居然能瞎扯到“相对论”上，胡说什么我方“是在应用现代相对论原理”，而迪安对相对论的了解是“不管在政治还是物理中每一件事物，都是和其他每一件事物无限相关的”，因此据迪安看来，建议讨论“其他有关问题”就等于要使朝鲜政治会议去“讨论任何事情”，就会使这个会议成为“一辆没有煞车、没有排挡、没有调速器的车子”。无须说明，这种说法决不是在严肃地讨论问题，而是纯粹无理取闹。
    甚至对于我方在发表公报与新闻采访的问题上，根据军事停战谈判中早已为双方所公认并沿袭已久的成例而提出的行政性质的建议，迪安不顾自己很难找到像样的理由，也竭力表示反对。
    朝中代表团相信每一个有判断力的人，从上面的大量事实中决不能认为美方代表在板门店谈判桌上还具有任何诚意。对于美方代表的行为只能有一个解释，就是他们想把政治会议的开会日期尽可能地拖延下去，拖过明年一月二十二日他们所谓的战俘拘留期限。关于这一点，迪安在十二月二日的会议上竭力企图为自己洗刷的发言中，已经欲盖弥彰地露出了马脚。迪安说：“如果政治会议在十二月二十二日至一月二十二日之间开着会，那么，就应该按照中立国遣返委员会的职权范围第十一款第一句的规定，讨论战俘问题。”迪安在这里是想偷偷地贩运一种论点，好像政治会议如果在一月二十二日以后召开，就不能再讨论战俘问题，好像到那时候还没有遣返的战俘就可以像美方所一贯片面宣传的那样，不经政治会议讨论即自动改变身份。这样，迪安就以他自己的发言证实了朝中方面的论断：美方是企图躲开政治会议来实现它一贯想以片面行动，来强迫扣留朝中方面被俘人员的阴谋。迪安顽固地拒绝我方所提政治会议应在十二月二十八日召开的建议，而要求代之以一个遥遥无期的公式的态度，进一步证实了这种论断。
    朝中代表团认为自己有责任提醒世界人民，警惕美方这种显然企图拖延朝鲜政治会议的阴谋。朝中方面一贯抱着诚意愿与美方在公平合理的基础上迅速达成协议，以便政治会议早日召开，朝鲜问题早日和平解决。但是我方的这种良好愿望，只有在对方愿意采取协商态度解决问题的条件下才能实现。如果对方顽固地拖延谈判，坚持无理取闹，则协议决难仅由我方单方面的诚意所能达成。现在朝中方面提出的全面建议，乃是对于美方有无诚意的一项严重考验。但是四天以来，美方不仅没有采取任何积极的态度，反而变本加厉地以逃避、拖延、歪曲、诬蔑的手段拒绝进行认真的协商。我方严正要求美方立即放弃这种手段。停战协定不容破坏，政治会议不容拖延，世界人民的和平愿望不容玩弄。美方如果继续一意孤行，它将无法逃避其拖延谈判的全部责任，并负担由此而起的一切后果。
