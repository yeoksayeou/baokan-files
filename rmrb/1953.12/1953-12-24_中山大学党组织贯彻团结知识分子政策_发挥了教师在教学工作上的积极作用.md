    The Chinese Communist Party's organization and leading cadres at Zhongshan University implemented the Party's policy of winning over, uniting, and transforming intellectuals. A friendly, united, and progressive atmosphere gradually formed within the university, enabling teachers to engage in self-transformation consciously and giving play to their enthusiasm in teaching work.
    In the early days after liberation, the faculty and students of Zhongshan University, on the one hand, had very high and urgent demands for reform, while on the other hand, some faculty members adopted a bystander attitude. This ideological situation seriously affected unity within the university. Based on the above situation, the Chinese Communist Party's organization and leading cadres at Zhongshan University promptly conducted education on the Party's policy toward intellectuals for Party members, League members, and activists. They criticized some Party members' incorrect views and rough attitudes toward some professors and gave due respect to knowledgeable scientists, enabling them to concentrate on scientific research and teaching work. In terms of administrative work within the university, they also listened to mass opinions in many ways, cooperated closely with non-Party administrative leaders, and gradually established a democratic style under the leadership of the president. After the adjustment of departments and faculties, cadres from various universities quickly united and cooperated.
    Zhongshan University paid great attention to teachers' study of Marxist-Leninist political theory and their acceptance of Marxist-Leninist viewpoints, positions, and methods in practice. In addition to organizing teachers to conduct regular political theory study under the leadership of the "Guangdong District Higher Education Political Study Committee," the university also paid attention to providing teachers with various opportunities to contact new things and understand the new society through participation in social reform movements such as "Land Reform," "Three-Anti," and "Five-Anti," as well as various construction projects, academic societies, professional conferences, and organizing teachers to travel and visit various regions. The university also commended a group of model teachers who could connect with the masses. Through this series of works, the phenomenon of activists being divorced from the masses was gradually changed. The teachers' teaching enthusiasm has also been brought into play. Zhou Cangkan, director of the Physics Department, actively led all the professors in the department to study teaching methods and translate Soviet textbooks. Starting this semester, all nine professors and associate professors in the department used the method of masters teaching apprentices to train eleven teaching assistants, helping the teaching assistants to formulate advanced study plans. Xia Jingnong, a professor in the department, also held seminars with students after class to help students understand the content of the teaching materials. Many professors also often tutor students in their homework after class. Jiang Lifu, a professor in the Department of Teaching, is over sixty years old, but he actively studies Russian and is now able to read general Russian professional books. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中山大学党组织贯彻团结知识分子政策
    发挥了教师在教学工作上的积极作用
    中国共产党中山大学的组织和领导干部贯彻党对知识分子的争取、团结、改造的政策，在校内逐渐形成友好团结共同进步的空气，使教师们能在自觉的基础上进行自我改造，发挥了教师们在教学工作上的积极作用。
    中山大学在解放初期，全校师生一方面对改革的要求很高很急，另方面部分教职员采取了旁观者的态度。这种思想情况严重地影响了校内的团结。中国共产党中山大学的组织和领导干部根据上述情况，及时地向党团员和积极分子进行党对知识分子的政策教育，批判了一些党团员对一些教授不正确的看法和粗暴的态度，并对有学识的科学家给以应有的尊重，使他们安心从事科学研究和教学工作。校内行政工作方面，也能多方听取群众意见，与党外行政领导干部密切合作，在校长负责制之下，逐步建立民主作风。院系调整后，使来自各校的干部很快就团结合作起来。
    中山大学十分注意教师们的马克思列宁主义的政治理论学习，和在实践中接受马克思列宁主义观点、立场和方法。该校除组织教师在“广东区高等学校政治学习委员会”领导下进行经常的政治理论学习外，并注意通过参加“土地改革”、“三反”、 “五反”等社会改革运动和各种建设工程、各种学会、专业会议以及组织教师到各地区旅行参观，使教师们获得各种机会接触新事物，理解新社会。该校还表扬了一批能联系群众的模范教师。经过这一系列的工作，逐渐改变了积极分子脱离群众的现象。教师们的教学积极性也得到发挥。该校物理系主任周詧侃积极领导全系教授研究教学方法、翻译苏联教材，从本学期起，全系九位教授、副教授都用师傅带徒弟的方法培养十一个助教，帮助助教订进修计划。该系教授夏敬农还在课外时间和学生举行座谈会，帮助学生理解教材内容。很多教授也经常在课外时间辅导学生做作业。教学系教授姜立夫已经六十多岁，还积极学习俄文，他现在已能阅读一般俄文业务书籍了。　（新华社）
