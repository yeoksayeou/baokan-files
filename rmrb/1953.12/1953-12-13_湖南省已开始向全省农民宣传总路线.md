Hunan Province has already had over 250,000 rural cadres and farmer representatives participate in General Line study sessions, and they are now展开ing propaganda about the General Line to the broad masses of farmers throughout the province, on a township-by-township basis. At the same time, Party and government organs at the provincial and regional levels have dispatched large numbers of cadres to work in the countryside. Zhou Xiaozhou, Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and leading cadres of the Provincial Committee have gone to counties such as Xiangtan and Liuyang to give reports and strengthen leadership over this work. Since late November, the New Hunan Daily, in addition to adding columns such as "Farmers' Lives" and "Mutual Aid and Cooperation" to carry out popular propaganda about the General Line to farmers, has also recently launched a "Discussion on the Ideological Transformation of Xiang Zhanmei" in the newspaper to cooperate with grain purchase work. Xiang Zhanmei is a farmer from Pingjiang County, Hunan. With the assistance of the People's Government, he was allocated land and his life improved. This year he has a large grain surplus, but in the past he planned to hoard grain for usury and wanted to buy land and hire laborers in the future. After studying the General Line, his political consciousness has been raised, and he has decided to take the socialist road, decided to sell his surplus grain to the state, and expressed his willingness to join a mutual aid team and strive to increase production.

The Dongting Lake area, the main grain-producing area of Hunan, has seen continuous bumper harvests for three years due to the People's Government's investment in vigorously repairing dikes and draining waterlogged areas, reducing the threat of floods. This year's grain output increased by 10 percent compared to last year. After listening to the propaganda about the General Line, farmers in these areas have further increased their patriotic enthusiasm. In Yulan Township, Yiyang County, which borders the lake, floods occurred frequently before liberation. Last winter, the People's Government allocated funds to repair the dikes and eliminate waterlogging. This year, the entire township added more than 2,000 mu of cultivated land, increasing rice production by more than 830,000 jin compared to last year. When studying the General Line, the farmers in the township recalled these events, realizing that this year's increased grain production and improved living standards are inseparable from the concern of the People's Government, and they all expressed their willingness to sell their surplus grain to the state. The Fourteenth District Committee of the CCP Liling County also used small-scale exhibitions to promote the benefits of industrialization to farmers with physical objects and charts. Farmer Chen Daoxue said after visiting the exhibition: "Before liberation, my family spent more than 1,500 jin of grain a year just on salt. Now the price of salt is cheap, and only 300 jin of grain is enough. These are all the benefits the state has given me." This year, the People's Government transferred water pumps to help some mountainous and hilly areas with irrigation and drought resistance. Using these examples for propaganda, it is easy for farmers to understand the benefits of industrial development for agriculture. Zhou Yuandao, a farmer from Santang Township, Hengnan, said: "This year, the township relied entirely on the water pump sent by the People's Government to save more than 1,000 mu of rice seedlings. If the country's industry is developed, the working-class brothers will manufacture more water pumps for us, and we will not be afraid of drought." After studying, many farmers realized that selling grain to the state and participating in mutual aid teams to strive for winter production are practical actions for farmers to support the state's General Line and participate in national industrialization. In addition to selling more than 7,900 jin of rice to the state, members of the Kang Juying Production Cooperative in Hengshan County recently plan to sell all of their remaining 8,000 jin of grain to the state and use the money from the sale to purchase fertilizer and other means of production. Farmers in XianShui Township, Hengyang County, recently sold more than 270,000 jin of grain to the state, completing the grain sales plan ahead of schedule. Now, the farmers in the entire township have enthusiastically投入ed themselves into winter production.

### 湖南省已开始向全省农民宣传总路线

    湖南省已开始向全省农民宣传总路线
    湖南省已经参加过总路线学习的乡村干部和农民代表二十五万多人，正在以乡为单位向全省广大农民展开总路线的宣传。同时，省、专区一级的党和政府机关都抽调了大批干部下乡工作。中共湖南省委书记周小舟和省委会的领导干部都到湘潭、浏阳等县作报告，加强对这一工作的领导。新湖南报自十一月下旬起除增辟“农民生活”、“互助合作”等栏向农民进行总路线的通俗宣传外，最近还为配合粮食收购工作，在报上发动乡村干部和农民进行“关于向占梅思想转变的讨论”。向占梅是湖南平江县农民，在人民政府扶助下，分得了土地，生活上升，今年已有很多余粮，但他过去计划囤粮放高利贷，还想以后买田请雇工。学习总路线后，他的政治觉悟提高了，已决心走社会主义道路，决定把余粮卖给国家，并表示要参加互助组，努力增产。
    湖南粮食主要产地洞庭湖滨地区，由于人民政府投资，大力修堤排渍，减少了水灾威胁，已连续获得三年丰收，今年粮食产量就比去年增产百分之十。这些地区农民在听了总路线宣传后，更提高了爱国热情。滨湖的益阳县玉兰乡，解放前经常闹水灾，去年冬天人民政府拨了款修好了堤，排除了渍水，今年全乡增加了二千多亩耕田，比去年增产了八十三万多斤稻谷。该乡农民在学习总路线时，联系回忆了这些事情，认识到今年多打粮食，生活改善与人民政府的关心分不开，都表示要把余粮卖给国家。中共醴陵县十四区区委员会，还用小型展览会方式，以实物和图表向农民宣传工业化对农民的好处。农民陈道学看了展览会后说：“解放前全家只买盐一项一年就要化一千五百多斤谷，现在盐价便宜，只需三百多斤谷就够了，这都是国家给我的好处。”今年人民政府曾调了抽水机帮助有些山区和丘陵地区灌溉、抗旱，这些地区用这实例进行宣传，农民容易了解工业发展对农业的好处的道理。衡南三塘乡农民周远道说：“今年乡里全靠人民政府送来一部抽水机，救活了一千多亩禾苗。国家工业发达了，工人老大哥会给我们制造更多抽水机，就不怕天旱了。”很多农民学习后都认识到当前把粮食卖给国家和参加互助组努力进行冬季生产，是农民拥护国家总路线和参加国家工业化的实际行动。衡山县康菊英生产合作社社员除了已经卖给国家七千九百多斤稻谷外，最近计划再把八千斤余粮全部卖给国家，把卖了谷所得款子购买肥料等生产资料。衡阳县咸水乡全乡农民最近向国家出售了二十七万多斤粮食，已提早完成了售粮计划，现在全乡农民已热情地投入冬季生产。　　　　　　（新华社）
