    Repairing Water Conservancy is an Important Key to Guaranteeing Agricultural Bumper Harvests
    Zhen Peide, Secretary of the CPC Xuancheng County Committee
    Farmers in Xuancheng County, Anhui Province, mainly grow rice, followed by wheat, rapeseed, corn, beans, sweet potatoes, etc. The southeast of the county is mostly mountainous terraced fields, relying on ponds and dams for irrigation, while the northwest borders the Shuiyang and Qingyi Rivers, mostly polder areas, relying on dikes for flood prevention. In the past, floods and droughts often occurred in summer. This year, despite dozens of consecutive days of drought, due to our leadership in mobilizing farmers to seize the opportunity to build water conservancy projects, fighting against water and drought disasters, and systematically promoting rice high-yield technologies, the yields of early and mid-season rice in the county still approached and maintained last year's high-yield level, basically achieving a bumper harvest.
    From 1949 to the autumn of 1952, we led farmers to build more than 8,477,000 cubic meters of water conservancy projects throughout the county, basically eliminating the phenomenon of major floods and droughts. Last winter, we extensively mobilized the masses, seized the opportunity to build water conservancy projects, and timely overcame the masses' paralyzing thought of "unstable winter repairs waiting for spring repairs," completing more than 80 percent of the winter and spring repair tasks in winter, giving farmers ample time to carry out this year's great production movement in spring.
    At the beginning of this year's spring production, according to the instructions of the higher-level Party committee and local production conditions, we formulated a year-round production plan and deployed it through various meetings such as county, district, and township expanded cadre meetings, mutual aid team leader and labor model representative meetings, and people's representative meetings, clarifying that production work is the central task of the whole year for cadres at all levels. During spring plowing and production, we timely implemented the CPC Central Committee's instruction that the production task is the overriding central task in rural areas, initially overcoming decentralism and subjectivism in our work, and clarifying the erroneous thinking among cadres that "production does not need leadership" and their lack of commitment to rural work. In mid-March, we stopped and postponed all work and meetings that hindered production, converted the work teams implementing the Marriage Law and other tasks in rural areas into production work teams, and also transferred eight county committee members to the countryside to take charge of production work by area, and transferred 178 cadres directly under the county to the countryside to help with the work, strengthening the specific leadership of production work and helping township cadres overcome the past phenomenon of "holding meetings for everything and being busy and chaotic when things happen," which made production impossible. By mid-April, under the principle of not delaying both spring plowing and spring repairs, we completed all spring repair work, exceeding the original plan by 10 percent.
    In mid-May, after a long period without rain, mountainous and polder areas were threatened by varying degrees of drought. We immediately determined that drought prevention and resistance was the central task at that time, based on the development of the drought situation, mobilized farmers to further rectify and improve the pond and dam water management organizations, and universally carried out three checks on ponds and dams: checking capacity, checking leaks, and checking water storage conditions. At this time, the county committee also went to the countryside to specifically guide drought prevention and resistance work, focusing on helping farmers find solutions. As a result, the threat of drought was overcome. Farmers in the No. 9 electoral district of Sanyuan Township in Tuan Mountain Area, under the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, tried a method of rational and unified water use, overcoming the phenomenon of "small ponds not having enough water and large ponds not using up the water." Farmers in Tuan Mountain Area also tried methods such as "living water ponds supporting dead water ponds" this year, which generally worked well. By the end of May, an average of 22,068 farmers in the county participated in drought resistance every day, using 1,304 waterwheels and 16 water pumps, digging 26 ditches, finding 54 springs, and building 29 dams, relieving the threat of drought for a total of 48,737 mu of land.
    In June, there was excessive rainfall and flash floods. The county's leadership in production shifted from drought prevention and resistance to flood prevention and drainage in the polder areas. In late June, county cadres braved the heavy rain to go deep into key areas to organize farmers to drain water, achieving mutual support between large and small polders, basically overcoming the flood disaster.
    This year, whether it was drought resistance and flood prevention or water conservancy construction, all achieved results. For example, in Tuan Mountain Area, after more than 60 days without rain, due to the well-repaired water conservancy, the 54,295 mu of early and mid-season rice in the area still achieved a bumper harvest, averaging 504.8 jin per mu, an increase of 36.5 jin per mu compared to last year. In Yangxian Polder, more than 22,600 mu of paddy fields suffered flooding on more than 10,000 mu in 1943, 1949, and 1951. The drainage and rescue efforts in 1951 were the most successful, but still 4,000 mu yielded nothing. This year, in late June, continuous rainfall of 180 mm caused 3,200 mu of fields to accumulate 3 to 9 inches of water, but it was completely drained within four days after the rain, and not a single mu of land was affected by the disaster.

    修好水利是保证农业丰产的重要关键
    中共宣城县委书记　甄培德
    安徽省宣城县农民以种植水稻为主，小麦、油菜、玉米、豆类、山芋等次之。这个县东南多是山区冲田，依靠塘坝灌溉，西北沿水阳、青弋两江，多是圩区，依靠圩堤防水，过去每到夏季，常遭水旱灾害。今年，在连旱数十天的情况下，由于我们领导农民抓紧兴修水利，向水、旱灾害作斗争，及系统地推广水稻丰产技术的结果，全县早、中稻的产量，仍然接近和保持了去年的丰产水平，基本上获得了丰收。
    从一九四九年到一九五二年秋季，我们就领导农民在全县范围内，兴修了八百四十七万七千多公方土的水利工程，基本上消灭了大雨涝灾、不雨旱灾的现象。去年冬季，我们又广泛发动群众，抓紧兴修水利，及时克服群众“冬修不牢等春修”的麻痹思想，在冬季完成了冬春两季兴修任务的百分之八十以上，使农民有充裕时间，进行今年春季的大生产运动。
    今年春季生产刚开始，我们根据上级党委的指示和当地生产条件，作出全年生产计划，通过县、区、乡扩大干部会、互助组长及劳动模范代表会、各界人民代表会等各种会议，进行了布置，使各级干部明确了生产工作是全年的中心。在春耕生产中，我们又及时贯彻了中共中央以生产任务为当前农村中压倒一切的中心工作的指示，初步克服了工作中的分散主义、主观主义，和澄清了干部中“生产不用领导”以及不安心搞农村工作等错误思想。三月中旬我们停止和推迟了一切妨碍生产的工作和会议，把在农村贯彻婚姻法和其他工作的工作队改为生产工作队，同时，还抽调八个县委下乡，分片掌握生产工作，并又抽调县直属机关干部一百七十八人，下乡帮助工作，加强了对生产工作的具体领导，帮助乡村干部克服了过去“逢事开会、事来乱忙”不能生产的现象。到四月中旬，在春耕春修两不耽误的原则下，就全部结束春修工作，超过原计划百分之十完成任务。
    五月中旬，久晴不雨，山区、圩区都遭受不同程度的旱象威胁。我们即根据旱情发展情况，确定以防旱抗旱为当时的中心任务，发动农民，进一步整顿和健全塘坝使水管理组织，普遍开展塘坝三查：查容量、查漏洞、查蓄水条件等。这时，县委又分头下乡，具体领导防旱抗旱工作，重点帮助农民想办法，结果，战胜了旱灾的威胁。团山区三元乡九选区的农民，在自愿和互利原则下，试行合理统一用水的方法，克服了“小塘水不够用、大塘水用不完”的现象。团山区的农民今年还试行了“活水塘支援死水塘”等办法，一般效果很好。到五月底，全县参加抗旱的农民平均每天达到二万二千零六十八人，动用水车一千三百零四部，抽水机十六部，开沟二十六条，寻找泉眼五十四个，打拦河坝二十九条，共解除了四万八千七百三十七亩田的干旱威胁。
    六月份，雨量过多，山洪暴发，全县领导生产的力量，便由防旱抗旱转到圩区的防汛排涝工作上来。六月下旬，县干部曾冒着大雨，分头深入重点地区，组织农民排涝，做到大小圩互相支援，基本上战胜了水害。
    今年不管是抗旱防涝，兴修水利都收到了成效。如团山区在六十多天未下雨的情况下，由于修好了水利，全区五万四千二百九十五亩早、中稻，仍然获得了丰收，平均每亩收五百零四点八斤，每亩比去年增产三十六斤半。养贤圩二万二千六百多亩水田，在一九四三、一九四九、一九五一三年中，受涝面积均达一万亩以上，一九五一年排涝抢救成绩最大，也还有四千亩无收。今年，这圩在六月下旬，连续落雨一百八十公厘，有三千二百亩田积水三至九寸，但雨后四天就全部排出了，一亩田也没有受灾。
