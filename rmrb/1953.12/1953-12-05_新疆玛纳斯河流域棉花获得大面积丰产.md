The cotton in the Manas River Basin in northern Xinjiang has achieved a large-scale bumper harvest this year, with cotton field yields creating a national record.

The agricultural production troops of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have completed the harvest of more than 26,000 mu of cotton planted in the Manas River Basin this year, and it has all been stored in warehouses. A total of more than 9.4 million jin of seed cotton were harvested, with an average actual yield of more than 357 jin of seed cotton per mu. Among them, more than 2,200 mu reached more than 500 jin per mu, and 74 mu reached more than 800 jin per mu. In Plot No. 15, more than 3.1 mu of land averaged more than 1,062 jin of seed cotton per mu, and even more, 1.61 mu of land averaged more than 1,288 jin of seed cotton per mu, breaking the national record for cotton field yield per unit area created by the Wu Chun'an Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yicheng County, Shanxi Province in 1952 (this record was an average yield of more than 1,021 jin of seed cotton per mu on 5 mu of high-yield cotton fields).

The reason why cotton in the Manas River Basin can achieve large-scale bumper harvests is that in addition to the emphasis and leadership of the Xinjiang leadership organs, the cotton planting experience accumulated by the production troops over the years, and the relatively superior labor organization and production tools, the most important reason is the frequent direct guidance of Soviet experts. Since Comrade Titov, a Soviet agricultural expert, came to Xinjiang in September last year, in addition to giving lectures and guiding experimental research at the August 1st Agricultural College, he has also frequently gone to production areas to design plans and guide various cotton planting technical work based on local conditions. In terms of winter and spring preparation, Comrade Titov specifically guided the selection of seeds, transportation of fertilizer, repairing farm tools, spring harrowing to preserve moisture, and the manufacture of granular fertilizers of bone ash and superphosphate. In terms of field management, he emphasized early thinning and early setting of seedlings, and carried a ruler to accurately set seedlings, so that cotton could develop as early as possible, and appropriately carry out dense planting to avoid missing seedlings caused by disasters. Comrade Titov also guided the establishment of four demonstration bases in the field to conduct demonstration experiments on sowing, row spacing, the number of seedlings to be retained, and the timing of pruning and topping, so as to prove whether this year's technical regulations are reasonable and how to revise them in the future. Regarding the issue of irrigation after autumn, he believed that it should be determined based on the moisture content in the field. If there is a lack of water, it must be irrigated, and irrigation can be carried out until the beginning of September.

In the past, it was generally believed that northern Xinjiang has a high latitude (around 45 degrees north latitude), low rainfall, cold climate, and short plant growing time, making it unsuitable for growing cotton. In fact, there are also many areas with very good natural conditions here. Now, the large-scale bumper harvest of cotton in the Manas River Basin further proves that the cotton production increase in the cold areas on the edge of the Junggar Basin in northern Xinjiang has tremendous potential.

    新疆玛纳斯河流域棉花获得大面积丰产
    新疆北部玛纳斯河流域的棉花，今年获得大面积丰产，棉田单位面积产量创造了全国最高纪录。
    中国人民解放军新疆军区农业生产部队今年在玛纳斯河流域种植的两万六千多亩棉花已全部收完，并分别入仓。总计共收籽棉九百四十多万斤，平均每亩实收籽棉三百五十七斤多。其中有二千二百多亩达每亩五百斤以上，七十四亩达八百斤以上。在第十五号地中，有三亩一分多地平均每亩收籽棉一千零六十二斤多，其中更有一亩六分一厘地平均每亩收籽棉一千二百八十八斤多，打破了一九五二年山西省翼城县吴春安农业生产合作社创造的全国棉田单位面积产量的最高纪录（这一纪录是五亩丰产棉田平均每亩收籽棉一千零二十一斤多）。
    玛纳斯河流域棉花所以能够大面积丰产的原因，除了新疆领导机关重视领导、生产部队几年来积累了植棉经验和劳动组织、生产工具比较优越外，最主要的原因是苏联专家经常的直接指导。苏联农业专家提托夫同志从去年九月到新疆后，除在八一农学院讲课和指导试验研究外，还经常到生产地区，从当地条件出发设计计划和指导各项植棉技术工作。提托夫同志在冬春准备工作方面，具体指导选种、运肥、整修农具、春耙保墒、制造骨灰和过磷酸钙的团粒肥料等工作。在田间管理方面，强调早间苗、早定苗，并携带尺码，正确定苗，以使棉花及早发育，适当进行密植，以免因灾害引起缺苗。提托夫同志并指导在田间建立四个示范据点，进行播种、行距、留苗株数和整枝摘心时期施肥等示范试验，以便证明今年各项技术规定是否合理及今后如何修正。对于秋后灌水问题，他认为应看地里的墒情来决定，缺水即须灌溉，灌到九月初旬都可以。
    过去一般都认为新疆北部纬度高（北纬四十五度左右）、雨量少、气候寒冷、植物生长时间短，不适合种植棉花。实际上这里也有很多自然条件很好的地区。现在玛纳斯河流域棉花所获得的大面积丰产，更进一步地证明了新疆北部准噶尔盆地边缘寒冷地区的棉花增产有着巨大的潜在力量。
