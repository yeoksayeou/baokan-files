Xinhua News Agency, 8th. Farmers across the country have begun to enthusiastically sell their surplus grain to the state. After selling their surplus grain, farmers are bound to demand a large supply of industrial products from the state. In addition, with the New Year and Spring Festival approaching, the demand for industrial products in the rural market will inevitably increase. Therefore, how to strengthen the supply of materials to the vast rural areas is currently a major issue and a matter of concern for the people of the whole country. Xinhua News Agency reporters specifically interviewed the person in charge of the Central Ministry of Commerce on the above issues, and received the following answers:

    State-owned commerce is an economy of a socialist nature, with the important tasks of stabilizing the market, ensuring supply, and promoting industrial and agricultural production. In the second quarter of this year, the Central Ministry of Commerce instructed its subordinates to expand the work of organizing sources of goods. Since July, under the leadership and assistance of Party committees and people's governments at all levels, and based on the new situation of increased industrial and agricultural production and universally improved purchasing power of the people across the country, especially according to the needs of farmers in grain and cotton areas, the work of actively organizing sources of goods has been further expanded. In the third quarter, state-owned commerce in Shanghai alone processed orders for small commodities accounting for 88 percent of the total value of daily-use goods produced by private factories in the city, an increase of 33 percent compared to the second quarter. In addition to vigorously organizing sources of goods in several major cities across the country, state-owned commerce also worked with cooperatives in small and medium-sized cities to organize sources of goods from local industries and handicrafts. Since the peak season, the sales situation in the market and the inventory situation of state-owned commerce can also illustrate that state-owned commerce has a considerable amount of materials in its control this year. Taking cotton cloth as an example, although the total sales volume of cotton cloth across the country in the third quarter of this year increased by 31.71 percent compared with the same period last year, the cotton cloth inventory at the end of the third quarter still increased by 41.6 percent compared with the same period last year. Up to now, processing orders from various places are still pouring in. The result of vigorously organizing sources of goods has not only powerfully promoted industrial production but also solved the needs of farmers.

    The person in charge of the Ministry of Commerce then said: In order to cooperate with the state's grain purchase tasks, the Central Ministry of Commerce issued an instruction on November 4, requiring state-owned commercial departments in various places to conscientiously and rapidly transfer the large amount of materials suitable for rural needs that have been acquired to the countryside, especially to grain-producing areas and economic crop-producing areas such as cotton and oil crops. Active sales should be carried out in both urban and rural areas to over fulfill sales plans. Since November, state-owned commercial departments in various places, under the leadership of Party and government leaders at all levels, have shifted their focus to actively organizing supply and have achieved remarkable results. The national state-owned commercial sales tasks for November have been successfully completed.

    Currently, materials from various places have been generally transferred to grassroots units and have begun to flow into the countryside. The Wuhan Municipal Department Store Purchasing and Supplying Station originally planned to supply rural areas with materials in the fourth quarter, but most of these materials were transported to state-owned grassroots department stores or business offices in various counties and towns before the end of November. In the Northwest region, where transportation is relatively difficult, the Xi'an Purchasing and Supplying Station of the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company also completed the annual transfer plan forty days ahead of schedule in mid-November. State-owned department stores and cotton yarn and cloth companies in major cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, and Beijing have also recently transferred a large number of industrial products suitable for farmers' needs to the countryside in order to support the acquisition of grain.

    The person in charge of the Ministry of Commerce said: The peak season materials prepared by state-owned commerce this year far exceed any previous peak season in terms of quantity and variety. As long as these materials are properly transferred and regulated, they will be able to meet the needs of the vast rural areas. In order to check the material organization and transfer situation in various places and to further investigate the new material requirements of farmers after selling their surplus grain, the heads of provincial and municipal commercial departments and the managers of provincial and municipal state-owned department stores, cotton yarn and cloth companies, etc., have gone deep into grassroots units to specifically lead the implementation of supply work. Leading cadres of the Central Ministry of Commerce and its affiliated specialized head companies will lead more than one hundred cadres to depart in early December to various places to inspect and assist in their work. The supply meetings of China Department Store, Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, etc. are in progress, preparing to advance the downward transfer of materials to be supplied to the countryside in the first quarter of next year. The Central Ministry of Commerce has established an office to specifically lead the transfer and regulation of materials in various places.

    The person in charge of the Ministry of Commerce then pointed out that there are currently two problems with the supply of materials to rural areas: First, state-owned commercial units in various places, in addition to closely combining with cooperatives to timely supply the industrial products needed by farmers, should also pay attention to utilizing private retailers and small vendors operating between urban and rural areas. Because the commercial networks of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce cannot fully meet the needs of consumers, private retailers and small vendors and small wholesalers operating between urban and rural areas who are engaged in legitimate business must be well utilized, but this does not mean that we can relax our opposition to their illegal activities such as speculation and price increases, but rather to better meet the supply of the rural market. Therefore, various places should, according to the specific situation, use various methods (such as convening forums for retail private merchants and urban and rural vendors) to publicize and explain to them the principle that they must obey the leadership of state-owned commerce. State-owned companies or wholesale stations will regularly wholesale them a certain amount of goods to those who can abide by the retail price set by state-owned companies. Second, further investigation and research into farmers' needs and improvement of transfer and regulation work must continue to be strengthened. Otherwise, even if materials are sufficient, there will still be a phenomenon of shortages in one place and stockpiles in another. Commercial administrative departments and enterprise leading departments in various places should, under the leadership of financial and economic committees at all levels, quickly transfer materials according to the situation of purchase, sales, and inventory, and distinguishing between urgency and priority. If the contract has been signed and cannot adapt to the new situation in the market, necessary measures such as advance allocation, delayed allocation, less allocation, and more allocation can be taken to first supply materials to the places in need, and then appropriately modify the original contract, handle liquidation and settlement issues, etc. In short, we must try our best to make the transfer of materials flexible. This requires the state-owned company system in various places to have an overall perspective, obey mobilization, earnestly grasp market changes, and ensure supply.

    中央商业部负责人发表谈话
    国营商业保证充分供应农村物资
    【新华社八日讯】全国各地农民已开始踊跃向国家出卖余粮。农民出卖余粮后，势必向国家要求大量的工业品供应，加上新年、春节将至，农村市场对工业品的需求也必日益增加。因此，如何加强对广大农村的物资供应是目前一个重大的问题，也是全国人民所关心的事情。新华社记者特就上述问题，访问中央商业部负责人，承其答覆如下：
    国营商业是社会主义性质的经济，负有稳定市场、保证供应、促进工农业生产等重大任务。中央商业部在今年第二季度时就指示所属，扩展组织货源的工作。七月以来在中共各级党委和各级人民政府的领导和帮助之下，根据全国工农业增产、人民购买力普遍提高的新情况，特别是根据粮棉区农民的需要，更进一步扩展了积极组织货源的工作。第三季度国营商业仅在上海一个地方加工订货的小百货就占该市私营厂日用百货生产总值的百分之八十八，数量比第二季度增加百分之三十三。除在全国几个大城市大力组织货源外，国营商业还结合合作社在中小城市向地方工业、手工业组织货源。自旺季以来，市场的销售情况及国营商业的库存状况也可说明国营商业今年掌握的物资是相当充足的。以棉布为例今年第三季度全国各地棉布销售总量虽比去年同期增加百分之三十一点七一；但到第三季度末棉布库存量仍比去年同期增加百分之四十一点六。直到目前，各地加工订货还在源源不断。大力组织货源的结果，不但有力地促进工业增产，且解决了农民的需要。
    商业部负责人接着说：为了配合国家购粮任务，中央商业部在十一月四日曾发出一个指示，要各地国营商业部门认真地把已掌握的大量适于农村需要的物资迅速调到农村去，尤其是调到粮食产区和棉花、油料等经济作物产区去，不论城乡都应积极出售，超额完成销售计划。十一月份以来，各地国营商业部门在各级党政领导下，已把工作重点转到积极组织供应方面，并获得显著成绩。全国国营商业十一月份的销售任务已胜利完成。
    目前各地物资已普遍调拨到基层单位，开始源源流入农村。武汉市百货采购供应站原计划在第四季度供应农村的物资，绝大部分已于十一月底以前运到各个县、镇的国营基层百货商店或营业所。交通比较困难的西北地区，中国花纱布公司西安采购供应站亦已在十一月中旬提前四十天完成全年的调拨计划。上海、天津、北京等大城市的国营百货、花纱布等公司为了支援各地收购粮食，最近也调出了大批适合农民需要的工业品下乡。
    商业部负责人说：国营商业今年所准备的旺季物资，无论在数量或品种上都大大超过往年任何一个旺季。这些物资只要调运调剂得好，是能够供应广大农村的需要的。为了检查各地物资组织和调拨情况，和进一步调查农民在出卖余粮后对物资新的要求情况，各个主要粮产区的省市商业厅长和省市国营百货、花纱布等公司的经理都已深入到基层单位具体领导供应工作的进行。中央商业部与所属各专业总公司的负责干部将率领干部百余人于十二月上旬出发到各地检查并帮助工作。中国百货、花纱布等公司的供应会议正在进行，准备把明年第一季度供应农村的物资提前下调。中央商业部已成立一个办公室，专门领导各地物资的调拨和调剂。
    商业部负责人接着指出目前农村物资供应工作尚存在两个问题：第一、各地国营商业单位除了密切结合合作社，及时供应农民所需要的工业品外，同时要注意利用私营零售商和城乡间的小贩运商。因为国营商业与合作社商业的商业网，还不能全部满足消费者的需要，所以对正当经营的私营零售商和城乡间的小贩运商、小批发商必须很好地利用，但这并不是说我们可放松反对他们的投机、抬价等违法行为，而是为了更好地满足农村市场供应。所以各地要根据具体情况，以各种方式（如召集零售私商、城乡贩运商开座谈会），向他们宣传和说明必须服从国营商业的领导的道理。凡是能遵守国营公司规定的零售牌价出售商品，国营公司或批发站将经常批发给他们一定的商品。第二、进一步调查研究农民需要和改进调拨、调剂工作，仍必须继续加强。否则，虽然物资充足，仍然会发生此地脱销彼地积压的现象。各地商业行政部门、企业领导部门应在各级财政经济委员会领导下，按照进货、销售，库存情况，分清缓急先后迅速调拨。如果已订合同不能适应市场新的情况，必要时可以采取先拨、后拨、少拨、多拨等办法，首先把物资供应到需要的地方去，然后再适当修改原订合同，处理清算结账等问题。总之，要尽量做到使物资调拨灵活起来，这样，就要求各地国营公司系统要有全局观点，服从调动，切实掌握市场变化，保证供应。
