    Learn from Ilyin
    Gu Junzheng
    The outstanding Soviet children's literature writer, Mikhail Ilyin, has passed away. This is a great loss. Ilyin was not only the closest friend of our country's children, but also a writer beloved by the vast number of adult readers in our country. His works have had a great impact on China's intellectual circles.
    Ilyin was born in St. Petersburg, now Leningrad, in 1895. His father was a chemist with diverse interests and knowledge. After graduating from middle school, Ilyin entered the University of Petersburg to study mathematics and physics. In his third year, he dropped out and worked in an oil refinery. After the October Revolution, he had the opportunity to study again. In 1925, after graduating from the Department of Chemistry at the Leningrad Industrial College, he became an engineer and began his writing career.
    Ilyin's writing life, spanning nearly thirty years, was almost uninterrupted, except during the Great Patriotic War. The first work that made Ilyin famous worldwide was "Stories About the Plan," published in 1930. In this book, he concisely and vividly described the dynamics of Soviet construction in all aspects during the first Five-Year Plan, using story form to express the truth of the inevitable prosperity of socialism and the inevitable decline of capitalism, and demonstrated the great power of man in nature. Such works were naturally loved not only by children but also by adults.
    When the Soviet "Literary Gazette" published the news of Ilyin's death, it said that he was a writer with a high level of culture, outstanding talent, and rare ability to work, which is very appropriate. From atoms to the universe, from the tools of hunters in primitive times to extremely complex modern machines, from the South Pole to the North Pole, from deserts to oceans, from minerals, plants, and animals to humans, from capitalism to communism, he knew almost everything. He wrote extremely complex phenomena so simply and clearly, and explained extremely profound principles so clearly and understandably. He tirelessly squeezed out time to write so many good works. Ilyin is a role model for our country's writers.
    Ilyin was an excellent propagandist for socialism and communism. Ilyin believed that communism is built on the foundation of science, and that people study science in order to transform nature and create happiness for the people. His works not only tell people how to understand nature, but also how to transform it, and depict the beautiful prospects of communist society, encouraging readers to fight for the realization of this great ideal.
    Works such as "Stories About the Plan", "Man and Mountain", "Earth and Man", "Man and Nature", and "How Man Became a Giant" were all written according to this goal. Ilyin's works are permeated with the noble spirit of loving the motherland, loving the people, loving science, loving labor, and loving public property.
    Ilyin's works all use a historical perspective to express the development of things. Ilyin criticized past children's books for lacking a sense of time. In the opening of "Man and Mountain," he said: "It seems that all kinds of things in the world are here, but one important thing is not mentioned. Time. It is a sleeping world, in which time is standing still." He believed that a static world is not a real world. When he wrote "Non-Night Sky," he wrote from the use of fireworks for lighting all the way to electric lights; when he wrote "Black and White," he wrote from ancient manuscripts all the way to printing presses; when he wrote about a small knife, he started from the mining of iron ore, and when he wrote about paper, he started from the forest. He introduced readers to the process of research work, explaining the process of gradually overcoming difficulties and exploring correct methods in work. He disagreed with the idea of ​​regarding Edison as the sole inventor of the electric light and Watt as the sole inventor of the steam engine. In his book "On Children's Scientific Reading Materials" (published by China Youth Publishing House), he said: "The image of Edison or Watt appearing alone in the history of science is like a card taken out of a whole deck, while the whole deck is discarded." He believed that attributing a certain invention to one person is the result of the private property society replacing scientific ideas with patent rights. He said:
  "Science is created by millions of hands. Every invention is the result of the hard work of countless scientists, experts, and inventors; some contribute more, some less. However, if one does not first know what achievements previous scientific workers have already made, it is difficult to estimate the merits of each of them."
    Ilyin's works also consistently embody the overall concept, guiding readers to develop a correct way of thinking, and not to look at problems in isolation. For example, in "Man and Nature," he explains that the cold air in Antarctica is related to the sea temperature in the Atlantic Ocean (page 131), and the sea temperature in the North Atlantic is related to the thawing date of rivers on the Russian Plain (page 360). He emphasizes:
  "Our air's weather and the water's weather, which is related to fish, are related to each other and influence each other." "In the universe, everything is related. When you know how the earth's water shell and air shell are connected to each other, this fact becomes clearer." (page 195)
    When discussing the writing skills of children's books, he advocated that writing comprehensively should not neglect vivid and specific details, so as not to turn the book into a sketch; at the same time, writing locally should not neglect everything around it, and readers must be able to infer the entire nation from individual characters; from individual plots, one can associate with the entire epic.
    Ilyin's works are also loved by readers because they have a high level of literary skills. From the beginning of his writing life, Ilyin fought for the artistry and scientific nature of popular science reading materials. In his article "Talking about Science" (see "China Youth" issue 104), he said: "Propagating natural science is like propagating anything else, it is an art of conquering readers, that is to say, this battle must be carried out according to various strategic and tactical rules. All words, ideas, facts, and conclusions must be selected and matched appropriately, and there must not be a single word that stays still. Ideas must lead with the support of powerful facts, and every conclusion must become a high ground occupied by fierce attacks."
    Ilyin is accustomed to using figurative stories to illustrate profound theories. After reading his "Stories About the Plan," you will never forget the story he made up about Mr. Fox's hat factory. This story satirizes the unplanned nature of capitalist production, is very funny, and also very serious, and very real. It clearly explains the reason for the periodic crisis in capitalist countries. Mr. Fox’s advertisement when Mr. Bawks, Mr. Rooks and Mr. Crooks also opened hat factories, resulting in overproduction, and competing with it by reducing prices said: "Your Excellency only has one head, but that does not mean that Your Excellency should only wear one hat. Every American should have three hats. Please buy Fox’s hats." After reading this advertisement, we seem to have seen the embarrassing face of Fox, the American capitalist, with our own eyes. We can find many such stories in Ilyin's works.
    Ilyin is very serious about using words and making sentences. He never lets go of using rich vocabulary and imagination to make vivid narratives. His fresh, vivid, and sometimes humorous and philosophical sentences give readers all kinds of emotions such as joy, laughter, anger, and deep thought. For example:
  "To transport a heavy round log - a big tree trunk, it takes twenty backs, forty hands, and forty feet." "The servants in the Persian palace must speak with signs. They can only talk to people of equal status with words. These unfortunate people are truly deprived of the 'right to speak' in the true sense of the word."
    He also tries his best to use sharp and powerful short sentences, refrains, and parallel sentences. Therefore, even if the subject matter is dry, it is written like poetry. He describes the impact of weather on human beings like this:
    "But when Her Majesty, the Queen of Weather, is in a bad mood, it really makes people embarrassed.
    "It sends hot winds to scorch the growing ears of wheat, and it orders frost to destroy the fruits in the garden.
    "It commands heavy snowstorms to block railway traffic, and it calls ice to block the path of ships.
    "It blocked the flight routes of airplanes. Every spring, it makes trips on land that it considers necessary.
    "Like a conqueror, it collects tribute from the entire country.
    "People calculated that in the Soviet Union alone, spring mud caused a loss of two billion rubles!
    "The weather's willfulness and stubborn tyranny are endless!
    "It can take anything to relieve boredom. Now it is playing with a small piece of paper, playing with a small feather. But tomorrow, it will use the same energy to play with and throw airplanes.
    "It can carefully shake a ripe apple from an apple tree, and it can also uproot a hundred-year-old oak tree.
  　"It is really powerful."
    Ilyin is also good at using metaphors to explain extremely complex principles. In "A Trip to the Atomic World," he explains the chain reaction of uranium atoms like this:
    "Here, just one neutron is enough to explode millions and millions of nuclei.
    "It's as if the shells are not falling on ordinary buildings, but on ammunition depots.
    "If the shell falls on an ordinary building, it will destroy the building. If you want to destroy the building next to it, you need new shells.
    "The situation is different when the shell falls on the ammunition depot. The explosion of this ammunition depot will cause the ammunition depot next to it to explode as well.
    "If many ammunition depots are very close together and arranged in a row, then just one shell is enough to cause all the ammunition depots to explode one after another."
    In short, Ilyin occupies the hearts of readers with various "strategies" and "tactics."
    Let us learn from Ilyin in many ways, learn his noble spirit of serving socialism and communism with his own unique weapons, learn his tireless work attitude, and learn his various "strategies" and "tactics"!
      Author's note: Most of the Chinese translations of Ilyin's works were previously published by Kaiming Bookstore. China Youth Publishing House has sought Ilyin's opinion and is preparing to reorganize these translations and compile them into eight volumes, which will be published successively in the first half of next year.

### 向伊林学习

    向伊林学习
    顾均正
    卓越的苏联儿童读物作家米哈伊尔·伊林逝世了。这是巨大的损失。伊林不但是我国少年儿童的最亲密的朋友，而且是我国广大成年读者所热爱的作家。他的作品在我国知识界产生了巨大的影响。
    伊林在一八九五年生于圣彼得堡，就是现在的列宁格勒。他的父亲是个化学工作者，有多方面的兴趣和知识。伊林在中学毕业后，入彼得堡大学学数理，到三年级的时候，辍学进一家炼油厂做工。十月革命以后，他又得到求学的机会。一九二五年他在列宁格勒工业专科学院化学系毕业后，就当工程师，同时开始了他的写作生活。
    伊林的近三十年的写作生活，除了卫国战争时期外，几乎没有间断过。使伊林名闻全世界的第一部作品，是他在一九三○年出版的“五年计划故事”。他在这本书里简洁生动地写出了苏联在第一个五年计划时期各方面建设的动态，用故事形式表现了社会主义的必然兴盛和资本主义的必然衰亡的真理，表现了人在自然界所发挥的伟大力量。这样的作品自然不仅为少年儿童所爱读，而且也为成年人所爱读。
    苏联“文学报”在发表伊林逝世消息时，说他是具有高度文化水平、杰出的天才和罕见的劳动能力的作家，这是非常恰当的。从原子到宇宙，从原始时代的猎人工具到极复杂的现代机器，从南极到北极，从沙漠到海洋，从矿物、植物、动物到人类，从资本主义到共产主义，他几乎无所不知。他把极复杂的现象写得这样简单明了，把极深奥的道理解释得这样清楚易懂。他孜孜不倦地挤出时间，写出这么多的好作品。伊林是我国作家们的学习榜样。
    伊林是社会主义和共产主义的优秀宣传员。伊林认为共产主义是在科学的基础上建立起来的，人们研究科学是为要改造自然，为要创造人民的幸福。他的作品不但告诉人怎样去认识自然，还告诉人怎样去改造自然，而且描出了共产主义社会的美丽远景，鼓舞着读者去为实现这一伟大的理想而奋斗。
  “五年计划故事”、“人和山”、“大地和人”、 “人和自然”、“人怎样变成巨人”等作品，都是根据这一目标而写作的。在伊林的作品中，贯彻着爱祖国、爱人民、爱科学、爱劳动、爱公共财物的高尚精神。
    伊林的作品，都用历史观点来表现事物的发展的。伊林批评过去的儿童读物没有时间观念。他在 “人和山”的开场白里说：“好像是世界上各种事物一件件都在这里，但是有一样重要东西没有谈到。时间。它是一个睡着的世界，在这个世界里，时间是停止的。”他认为静止的世界就不是一个真实的世界。他写“不夜天”，就从用烟火照亮一直写到电灯；写“黑白”就从古代手抄本一直写到印刷机；写一把小刀从开采铁矿写起，写纸张从森林写起。他把读者引入研究工作的过程，说明在工作中逐步克服困难和探索正确的方法的过程。他不同意把爱迪生当作电灯的唯一发明人，把瓦特当作蒸汽机的唯一发明人的说法。他在“论儿童的科学读物”（中国青年出版社出版）一书中说：“爱迪生或是瓦特的形象单独地出现在科学史上，就像从整副纸牌中取出的一张纸牌，全副纸牌却被丢在一旁了。”他认为把某一种发明归功于一个人，是私有财产社会中把专利权代替了科学思想的结果。他说：
  “科学是千万双手所创造的。每一件发明都是无数科学家、专家、发明家辛劳的结果；这一个贡献多一些，那一个少一些。然而如果不先知道以前的科学工作者已经有了些什么成就，却要估计他们当中每一个的功绩，那就困难了。”
    伊林的作品中还处处贯彻着整体观念，它引导读者养成一种正确的思想习惯，不孤立地去看问题。例如在“人和自然”里，他说明南极的冷空气是与大西洋上的海水温度有关联的（页一三一），而大西洋北部的海水温度是与俄罗斯平原上江河的开冻日期有关联的（页三六○）。他着重地指出：
  “我们的空气的天气跟那个和鱼有关系的水的天气，彼此关联，互相影响。”“在宇宙里，一切都是有关联的。当你知道了地球的水的外壳和空气的外壳在怎样互相联系的时候，这个事实便更加明了了。”（页一九五）
    他在讨论儿童读物的写作技巧时，主张写全面不应当忽视生动、具体的细节，以免把书变成一张略图；同时写局部也不应当忽略它周围的一切，必须使读者能够从个别的人物推测出整个民族；从个别的情节联想到整部的史诗。
    伊林的作品所以为读者所喜爱，也因为它具有高度的文艺技巧。伊林从开始写作生活的时候起，就为争取普及知识的读物的艺术性和科学性而斗争。他在“谈谈科学”（见“中国青年”一○四期）一文中说：“宣传自然科学和宣传任何东西一样，是征服读者的一种艺术，也就是说这场战斗必须依照各种战略、战术的规则来进行。所有用字、思想、事实和结论，一定要经过选择和配搭得当，不要有一个字呆着不动，要凭借有力的事实的支援来使思想领先，要使每一个结论成为猛攻占领的高地。”
    伊林惯于用形象化的故事来说明深奥的理论。你读了他的“五年计划故事”，就永远忘不了他编造出来的福克斯先生开帽厂的故事。这个故事讽刺资本主义生产的无计划性，很可笑，也很严肃，很真实，它清楚地说明了资本主义国家发生周期性危机的道理。福克斯先生在鲍克斯先生、罗克斯先生、克洛克斯先生同时也开设帽厂，以致造成生产过剩，跟它减价竞争时所登的广告上说：“阁下只有一个头，然而这并不是说阁下只应戴一顶帽子。每个美国人都应该有三顶帽子。请买福克斯的帽子。”我们读了这个广告，仿佛亲眼看到了福克斯这个美国资本家的尴尬的嘴脸。像这样的故事，我们可以在伊林的作品中找到许多。
    伊林对于用词造句是非常认真的。他从不放过运用丰富的词汇和想像来作生动的叙述。他的清新、生动、有时又富于幽默和哲理的文句，给读者以喜、笑、愤怒、深思等各式各样的情感。例如：
  “为了搬运一根沉重的圆木料——大树干，要用二十条脊背、四十只手和四十只脚。”“波斯的王宫里的仆人必须用记号来说话。他们只能跟与自己地位平等的人用言语交谈。这些不幸的人真是名副其实地被剥夺了‘发言权’。”
    他还尽量应用警辟有力的短句、叠句、排句，因此尽管是枯燥的题材，也写得像诗一样。他这样地描写了天气对于人类的影响：
    “但是当天气女王陛下没好气儿的时候，可真叫人们为难了。
    “它派遣热风去烧焦正在生长着的麦穗，它命令寒霜去摧残园里的果实。
    “它号令大风雪阻碍铁路交通，又叫冰块挡住轮船的去路。
    “它阻断了飞机的航线。每年春天，它在陆地上做它自己认为必要的旅行。
    “它像一个征服者，在整个国土上征收着贡物。
    “人们算了一算，光是苏联，春季的泥泞就造成了二十亿卢布的损失！
    “天气的任性和顽劣的暴行，真是没完没了！
    “它会随便拿什么来解闷。现在它在玩一张小纸片，玩一根小羽毛。但是明天，它将以同样的劲头儿来玩弄、来抛掷飞机。
    “它能够细心地从苹果树上摇下一枚熟透了的苹果，也能够把百年的老橡树连根拔起来。
  　“它真是力大无比。”
    伊林又善于用比喻来说明极复杂的事理。他在“原子世界旅行记”中是这样地说明了铀原子的连锁反应的：
    “在这里，只消有一个中子，就足够用来爆破千百万万个原子核了。
    “好像炮弹不是落在普通的建筑物上，而是落在弹药库里了。
    “炮弹落在普通的建筑物上，它就把建筑物击毁了。要是想击毁旁边的建筑物，又需要用新的炮弹。
    “炮弹落在弹药库里，情形就不同了。这一个弹药库爆炸，会使旁边的弹药库也引起爆炸。
    “假如许多弹药库都挨得很紧，排成一行的话，那么只要用一发炮弹，就足够使所有的弹药库一个跟着一个爆炸。”
    总之，伊林是以各种各样的“战略”和“战术”来占领读者的心的。
    让我们多方面地向伊林学习吧，学习他以自己特有的武器为社会主义、共产主义服务的高尚精神，学习他的孜孜不倦的劳动态度，学习他的各种各样的“战略”和“战术”！
      作者附记：伊林著作的中译本，以前大都由开明书店出版，中国青年出版社曾征求伊林本人的意见，准备将这些译本重新整理，编成八卷，明年上半年陆续出版。
