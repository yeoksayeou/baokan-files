    Geological exploration personnel, who are surveying underground resources for the motherland, have received enthusiastic support from the masses in various regions. In the early summer of this year, the Southwest Geological Bureau organized a prospecting team to carry out a comprehensive resource survey in the southern border region of Yunnan. When the prospecting team arrived at Yuanchong River, a peasant woman, Zhou Shaofu's mother, brought a black and shiny stone to the team, asking the comrades to check if it was ore. The prospecting team recognized it as lead ore, and everyone was extremely happy. This lead ore had been picked up by her husband while working in the mountains and had been kept for forty years. During the reactionary rule, she had never shown it to anyone, but now she献给 (xiàn gěi - dedicated) this treasure to the country. In Zhichang Township, there was a 76-year-old peasant named Wang Liangwen, who, although he couldn't even straighten his back, insisted on personally leading the prospecting team to find the mine shafts that had been mined a hundred years ago. He used a firewood chopper to cut through the thorns in front, and finally led the team to eight old mine shafts. On the Kangzang Plateau, the Tibetan people were very fond of the scientists sent by Chairman Mao. Once, in Bomi, the mountains were blocked by heavy snow, and more than a dozen Tibetan men and women drove more than thirty yaks, breaking a path through the snow to help the scientific team cross the snowy mountains. Another time, when a scientific team wanted to go from Damxung in northern Tibet to Tengri Lake, which has a high and cold terrain, the local Tibetan people prepared Tibetan clothing for them to keep warm, and used yaks to carry tents and dried yak dung, accompanying them for seven days until the work was completed before returning home.
    The geological exploration team also received enthusiastic hospitality from the local people in their daily lives. When the prospecting team conducting exploration in southern Yunnan arrived at Guanfang Village, the Yi people gave up the best house in the village. That evening, the people of Guanfang Village also held a welcome party, using their ethnic songs and dances to entertain the people who were surveying the treasures of the motherland. The prospecting team worked here for a few days, and the Yi people constantly came to visit them, and the women often washed and mended clothes for the comrades of the team. When the team left Guanfang Village, the elderly and children in the village all came to see them off, and the young Yi men and women working in the fields outside the village repeatedly waved goodbye to them.
    People in various regions not only actively helped the geological exploration team, but some also directly participated in this work. When the geological work group exploring Wushi Mountain in the old revolutionary base area of Jinggangshan, as the prospecting work was fully launched, manpower and materials could not be supplied in time, the people of Wushi Mountain actively supported. They said: We can't just watch the geological work group stop working. So they actively took action, some participating in digging trenches, some participating in road construction. Some literate members of the Communist Youth League participated in the drilling team, and some party members and township cadres participated in the transportation team.
    The enthusiastic help and support of the masses greatly encouraged the work enthusiasm of the geological exploration workers, and they were determined to respond to the expectations and care of the people with practical actions. The geological work group working in Wushi Mountain basically completed the prospecting task for 1953 in eight months, and some work was overfulfilled. The comrades of the geological exploration team working in Wushi Mountain and the people of Wushi Mountain have a lofty ideal: In the dark years, Chairman Mao ignited the flame of revolution from here to the whole country; today, they want to use the iron here to support the motherland in achieving industrialization as soon as possible.

### 各地农民热烈支援地质勘探工作

    各地农民热烈支援地质勘探工作
    为祖国勘查地下资源的地质勘探工作人员，得到了各地群众热情的支持。今年初夏，西南地质局组织了一个普查队，在云南南部边疆展开全面的资源勘查工作。普查队到达缘冲河时，农民周少富的妈妈就抱了一块又黑又亮的石头来找普查队，她要求普查队的同志们看看是不是矿。普查队的同志一看是块铅矿，大家高兴极了。这块铅矿是她丈夫在山里干活拾来的，已经保存了四十年。在反动派统治时，她从来没有给人看过，现在她把这个宝贝献给了国家。在纸厂乡，有一位七十六岁的农民王良文，虽然连腰也伸不直了，但他坚持要亲自带着普查队的同志去找一百年前曾经开采过的矿洞。他拿着一把劈柴刀在前面斩荆棘开路，终于带领普查队找到了八个旧矿洞。在康藏高原，藏族人民十分喜爱毛主席派去的科学家们。有一次在波密，大雪封了山，十几个男女藏民赶着三十多头牦牛，在积雪中冲开了一条路，送科学工作队翻过雪山。又有一次，某科学工作队要从藏北的当雄到地势高寒的腾格里湖去，当地藏胞就给他们准备了御寒的藏族服装，并用牦牛驮着帐篷和干牛粪，陪伴他们走了七天的路程，一直到工作完了才回家。
    地质勘查队在生活上也得到了当地群众的热情招待。在云南南部进行勘查的普查队到达官房村时，彝族人民就把村里最好的房子让出来。当天晚上，官房村群众还开了一个欢迎会，用本民族的歌舞来招待勘测祖国宝藏的人们。普查队在这里工作了几天，彝族人民不断来看望他们，妇女们经常给普查队的同志洗衣服、补衣服。当普查队离开官房村的那天，村里的老人、孩子都来欢送，在村外田里工作的彝族青年男女也一再向他们挥手告别。
    各地群众不仅积极帮助地质勘探队工作，有些人还直接参加了这一工作。在革命老根据地——井冈山区乌石山进行勘探的地质工作组，当探矿工作全面展开后，人力、物资一时供应不上，乌石山的人民就积极支援。他们说：说什么也不能眼看着地质工作组停工。于是他们积极行动起来，有的参加挖槽，有的参加修路。有些识字的青年团员参加了钻探队，有些党员和乡干部参加了运输队。
    群众的热情帮助和支援，大大鼓舞了各个地质勘探工作人员的工作热情，他们决心以实际行动来回答人民的期望和关怀。在乌石山工作的地质工作组，他们以八个月的时间基本上完成了一九五三年的探矿任务，部分工作并超额完成。在乌石山工作的地质勘探队的同志们和乌石山的人民，有一个崇高的理想：在黑暗的岁月里，毛主席把革命的火焰从这里燃遍全国；今天他们要用这里的铁，支援祖国早日实现工业化。
