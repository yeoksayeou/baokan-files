    The construction of the Asian Student Sanatorium in the scenic Badachu area of ​​Xishan, Beijing, which included the administrative building, admission building, ward building, Chinese and Western kitchen, and laundry room, was completed ahead of schedule by December 15th.
    In order to enable students from Asian countries to come to our country for recuperation as soon as possible, the construction workers launched a labor emulation campaign. On the basis of ensuring project quality, they strived to complete the task ahead of schedule. A special inspection team was established at the construction site, and quality counselors were set up in each working group to conduct appraisals daily from four aspects: quality, quantity, safety, and increased production and thrift. Therefore, the quality of each project reached the expected standards.
    During the construction of the Asian Student Sanatorium, many relevant units actively supported the construction site in various ways. The materials supply department selected and delivered ample high-quality materials. The Beijing-Tianjin Highway Transportation Bureau used fifteen large trucks to transport materials specifically for the construction site. The Beijing No. 3 Construction Engineering Company also sent additional technical cadres to strengthen the leadership of the construction site management. Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and Tian Demin, Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation, were very concerned about this project and visited the construction site to provide guidance. Hu Yaobang also requested that more trees and flowers be planted around the sanatorium to provide a quiet and comfortable recuperation environment for students from Asian countries coming to our country for treatment. Currently, the construction site is summarizing the experience of this year's construction and is actively preparing for next year's construction. (Xinhua News Agency)

    亚洲学生疗养院今年工程已按计划完成
    在北京风景区西山八大处建筑的亚洲学生疗养院工程，今年施工的行政大楼、入院处楼、病房大楼、中西餐厨房和洗衣房等工程，到十二月十五日止，已按计划超额完成。
    为了使亚洲各国学生能够早日来我国疗养，建筑工人们展开了劳动竞赛。在保证工程质量的基础上，争取提前完成任务。工地专门成立了检查组，在各个工作小组中都设有质量辅导员，每天从质量、数量、安全、增产节约四方面进行鉴定。因此各项工程在质量上都达到了预计的标准。
    在亚洲学生疗养院工程施工期间，很多有关单位从各方面积极支援这个工地。材料供应部门选送了充足的上等材料。京津公路运输局以十五辆大卡车专门为工地运输材料。北京市第三建筑工程公司还增派了技术干部加强工地施工管理的领导。中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记处书记胡耀邦、中华全国学生联合会主席田德民等都非常关心这个工程，曾到工地指导。胡耀邦还要求把疗养院的周围种植更多的树木和花草，使来我国疗养的亚洲各国学生能得到幽静舒适的疗养环境。现
