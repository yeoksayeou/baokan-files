Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, December 15th: The farmers of Shaoshan Township, Xiangtan County, Hunan Province—the hometown of Chairman Mao—have all completed their plan to sell surplus grain to the state. This is one of the earliest townships in Hunan Province to complete the plan to sell surplus grain to the state. This year, Shaoshan Township had a bumper harvest of rice, with a total increase of more than 340,000 jin of rice compared to last year, and this time sold more than 120,000 jin of surplus grain. On December 11th, after completing the plan to sell surplus grain, the farmers of the entire township wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, reporting their warm support for the national general line. The original letter is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao:
	The farmers of your hometown, under the great, glorious, and correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and your wise leadership, and with the strong support of the People's Government, have displayed a high degree of enthusiasm for production and actively responded to your call to organize and develop production. Of the 624 households in the entire township, 296 households have been organized, accounting for 47.4% of the total number of households. Among them, five permanent mutual aid teams and thirty-four temporary mutual aid teams have been organized. This year, double-cropping rice was also tested, and advanced cultivation techniques such as standardized nurseries, appropriate close planting, deep plowing, and salt water seed selection were promoted, and chemical fertilizers were also applied, enabling the entire township to achieve an all-round bumper harvest. This year, on the basis of last year's bumper harvest, the average yield per mu reached 600 jin, an increase of more than 20% compared to last year.
	Chairman Mao: After studying the national general line this time, we know that the country's socialist industrialization is to build the motherland and consolidate national defense, so that our farmers can use machines to cultivate the land. Everyone firmly supports it and says: Good! We are willing to follow the Communist Party and take the socialist road. By the 11th of this month, the farmers of the entire township had sold more than 120,000 jin of surplus grain to the state, successfully completing the plan of the entire township's farmers to sell surplus grain. Chairman Mao: This is our actual action to love you, love our country, and firmly support the national general line.
	Now, we guarantee to actively carry out the mutual aid and cooperation movement, learn advanced production experience, improve cultivation techniques, further increase production, and sell more surplus grain to the state in the future to develop production and improve our lives, so that our country can be industrialized at an early date.
	The Entire Farmers of Shaoshan Township, Xiangtan  December 11th
