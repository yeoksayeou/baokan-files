    Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
    Begins to Overcome Difficulties in Lack of Secondary School Teachers

    The Inner Mongolia Normal College has trained a group of Mongolian middle school education talents this year, and has begun to overcome the difficulties of the autonomous region's lack of secondary school teachers.
    In the past, education in Inner Mongolia was very underdeveloped. According to statistics in 1947, the entire region had only one Mongolian middle school and twenty-five teachers. However, in the eight years since liberation, Mongolian primary school education has developed rapidly, and a large number of graduates go on to middle school every year. Therefore, after the Inner Mongolia Normal College was established in 1952, it actively cultivated talents for secondary education, setting up nine specialized subjects such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, with fifteen classes. All three hundred and sixty-four students in the college are the children of the laboring people of six ethnic groups, including Mongolian, Solon, Korean, Hui, and Manchu. Many ethnic minorities come from pastoral and forest areas. This autumn, the first graduating class of Mongolian students from the Normal College, fifty in total, have happily taken up their posts. Due to the increase in middle school teachers, fifteen secondary schools in the autonomous region have added Mongolian student classes, and a new Mongolian middle school has also been established in Ulanhot.

    内蒙古自治区
    开始克服缺乏中学师资的困难
    内蒙古师范学院今年培养了一批蒙族中等教育人材，开始克服自治区缺乏中学师资的困难。
    过去内蒙古教育事业很不发达，据一九四七年统计，全区只有一所蒙族中学、二十五名教师。但在解放后八年来，蒙族小学教育迅速发展，每年有大批毕业生要升入中学。因此，内蒙古师范学院在一九五二年成立后，便积极培养中等教育人材，分设数学、物理、化学、生物等九种专修科，十五个班次。全院三百六十四名学生是蒙族、索伦族、朝鲜族、回族、满族等六个民族的劳动人民子弟，很多少数民族是来自牧区和森林地区的。今年秋季，师范学院第一届蒙族毕业生五十人，已经愉快地走上工作岗位。由于中学师资的增加，自治区已有十五个中等学校增加了蒙生班次，乌兰浩特市还成立了一所新的蒙族中学。（新华社）
