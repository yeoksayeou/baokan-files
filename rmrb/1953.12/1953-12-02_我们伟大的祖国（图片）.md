Our great motherland
Peasants in various regions enthusiastically support the construction of the motherland and sell their surplus grain to the state. All members of the Jinhai Guan Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Jilin City unanimously agreed to sell 300,000 jin of surplus rice to the state. They plan to use over 130 million yuan to buy carts, cattle, and fertilizers, repay agricultural loans, and deposit the remaining money in the National Bank. These two cooperative members are busy loading grain, ready to send it to the supply and marketing cooperative.
