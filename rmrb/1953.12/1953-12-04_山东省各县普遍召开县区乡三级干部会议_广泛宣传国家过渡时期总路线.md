In Shandong Province, all counties universally convened county, district, and township three-level cadre meetings around November 10th, to convey to the attending cadres the Party's general line and general task for the transition period and lead everyone in discussions. Based on the improvement of cadre thinking, they discussed how to vigorously conduct publicity and education on the general line to farmers through the current central work in rural areas.

The Shandong Branch of the CCP Central Committee convened an expanded cadre meeting in October, at which Comrade Tan Zhenlin, Third Secretary of the East China Bureau of the CCP Central Committee, delivered a report on the Party's general line and general task for the transition period. All county party secretaries in the province listened to and studied this report. After the meeting, the Shandong Branch of the CCP Central Committee and the Shandong Provincial People's Government immediately dispatched more than 120 cadres, forming eleven work groups led by responsible comrades from various departments, to ten administrative regions to assist in implementing current work and publicizing the Party's general line and general task for the transition period. Xiang Ming, Second Secretary of the Shandong Branch of the CCP Central Committee, successively went to Licheng, Tai'an, Jinan and other counties to deliver reports on the Party's general line to the three-level cadre meetings in each county. Wang Lubin, a member of the Shandong Branch of the CCP Central Committee, Xia Zhengnong, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Branch, and Mu Lin, Deputy Secretary of the Rural Work Committee of the Branch, also went to various regions to guide current work and the publicity of the general line. During the period when the counties convened cadre meetings, the responsible comrades of the local party committees also went to the counties to provide specific guidance.

Under the in-depth and specific guidance of leading cadres at all levels, the cadre meetings in various counties were very successful, improving the political awareness of the cadres and their confidence and determination to strive for the country's gradual transition to socialism. The cadres unanimously reflected: "After studying the general line, we feel enlightened!" "Our confidence is higher, and our energy is greater."

When responsible cadres at all levels conveyed the Party and the State’s general line for the transition period to county, district, and township cadres, they generally took into consideration the level of the cadres, starting from the shallow and progressing to the deep, combining the specific situation of the local area, and relating to the cadres' personal experiences to educate the attending cadres. In the reports, they generally first pointed out the benefits brought to the peasants by the victory of the revolution, and then linked the spontaneous capitalist tendencies of some farmers lending money, buying land, and hoarding grain, pointing out their harmfulness, so that the attending cadres recognized that only by taking the socialist road could they achieve a bright future. On this basis, they focused on explaining that mutual aid teams and agricultural producers' cooperatives are the specific paths for implementing the socialist transformation of agriculture. It was pointed out that rural areas must run agricultural producers' cooperatives well to drive mutual aid teams, increase grain production, and support national economic construction. After repeated discussions, everyone clearly recognized that the Party and the State’s general line for the transition period is a lighthouse illuminating all work, the importance of the country gradually implementing the socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts, and the policy of agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation. At the same time, they also clearly recognized the relationship between agricultural production and industrial production, as well as the importance of increasing grain production to support national economic construction. Li Fenghai, secretary of the Jiangzhuang Township Party Branch in the Second District of Mengyin County, said: "After listening to the report on the general line and general task, I was so happy that I couldn't sleep all night. It is truly a bright light that illuminates my heart completely. In the future, I will work hard towards this bright light. I will definitely do a good job in mutual aid teams and try to set up an agricultural producers' cooperative this winter to do a good job in production, produce more grain, and support the country in realizing industrialization and strive to use tractors as soon as possible!" Chen Shiping, militia captain of Chenzhai Township in the Eighth District, said: "Chairman Mao put forward the general line and general task, and we must lead the farmers to do a good job in mutual aid teams and cooperatives, increase production and save grain, and support national construction. I can save 1,000 kilograms of grain this year, and I will definitely take the lead in selling it to the country when I go back, and mobilize the farmers in the township to actively sell surplus grain to the country." At the county, district, and township three-level cadre meeting in Shen County, everyone enthusiastically expressed that they would actively produce and build a new socialist countryside in the future. Cadres in other counties also studied with full confidence how to educate farmers on the general line and do a good job in various winter tasks.

    山东省各县普遍召开县区乡三级干部会议
    广泛宣传国家过渡时期总路线
    山东省各县十一月十日前后普遍召开了县、区、乡三级干部会议，向到会干部传达了国家在过渡时期的总路线、总任务并领导大家进行了讨论。在干部思想提高的基础上，讨论了如何通过目前农村中的中心工作，大张旗鼓地向农民进行总路线的宣传教育。
    中共中央山东分局在十月间召开了扩大干部会议，由中共中央华东局第三书记谭震林同志作了关于国家过渡时期总路线、总任务的报告。全省各县县委书记，都听取和学习了这一报告。会议结束后，中共中央山东分局、山东省人民政府随即抽调干部一百二十余人，组成十一个工作组，由各部门负责同志带领，分赴十一个专区，协助各地贯彻当前工作与宣传国家过渡时期总路线、总任务。中共中央山东分局第二书记向明同志，曾先后前往历城、泰安、济宁等县，向各该县三级干部会议作了关于国家总路线的报告。中共中央山东分局委员王路宾、分局宣传部部长夏征农、农村工作委员会副书记穆林等同志，也到各地区指导当前工作和总路线的宣传。各县召开干部会议期间，各地的地委负责同志，也分赴各县具体指导。
    在各级领导干部深入具体指导下，各县的干部会议开得很好，提高了干部的政治觉悟水平和为国家逐步过渡到社会主义而奋斗的信心和决心。干部们一致反映：“学习了总路线，心里亮堂了！”“信心高了，劲头足了。”
    各级负责干部在向县、区、乡三级干部传达党和国家在过渡时期的总路线时，一般都照顾到了干部的水平，由浅入深，结合当地的具体情况，联系干部的切身体验，教育到会干部。在报告中一般都首先指出了革命胜利带给农民的好处，然后联系一部分农户放债、买地、囤积粮食等资本主义自发倾向，指出其危害性，使到会干部认识了只有走社会主义道路才是康庄大道。在此基础上，着重地讲解了互助组、农业生产合作社，是对农业实行社会主义改造的具体道路。指出农村必须办好农业生产合作社带动互助组，增产粮食，支援国家经济建设。经过反复讨论，大家明确认识到：党和国家在过渡时期的总路线是照耀着一切工作的灯塔，国家对农业、手工业逐步地实行社会主义改造的重要性和农业生产互助合作的方针、政策。同时，他们还明确认识了农业生产与工业生产的关系，以及增产粮食支援国家经济建设的重要意义。蒙阴县二区姜庄乡党支部书记李凤海说：“听了总路线、总任务的报告，我喜得一夜没睡着觉。它真是一盏明灯，把我的心全照亮了，今后我要努力奔着这盏明灯向前干。回去一定把互助组搞好，今冬试办一处农业生产合作社，搞好生产，多打粮食，支援国家实现工业化，争取早日使上拖拉机！”八区陈寨乡武装队长陈士平说：“毛主席提出总路线、总任务，咱得领导农民搞好互助组、合作社，增产节约粮食，支援国家建设。我今年能余一千斤粮食，我回去一定带头卖给国家，并动员全乡农民积极卖余粮给国家。”在莘县县区乡三级干部会议上，大家热烈地表示，今后要积极生产，建设社会主义新农村。其他各县的干部也都满怀信心地研究了如何向农民进行总路线的教育，作好冬季各项工作。
