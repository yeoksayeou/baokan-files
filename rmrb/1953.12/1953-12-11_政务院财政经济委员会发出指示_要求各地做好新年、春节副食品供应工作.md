Xinhua News Agency, December 10th: The State Council Financial and Economic Committee recently issued "Instructions on Doing a Good Job in Supplying Non-Staple Foods for the New Year and Spring Festival." In addition to instructing the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Foreign Trade to jointly take responsibility for proper arrangements, the instructions also require the financial committees and commercial departments/bureaus of all major regions, provinces, and cities to take their leadership seriously, concentrate their efforts, and ensure the supply meets the people's needs.

The instructions first state that the New Year and Spring Festival are approaching. In previous years, the demand for non-staple foods from urban and rural people has increased during this period compared to normal times. This year, due to the start of national planned construction, a large increase in the population of urban industrial and mining areas, and the improvement of people's living standards, the consumption of non-staple foods has increased. On the other hand, the purchasing power of farmers will inevitably increase after selling surplus grain, and their consumption of non-staple foods will also increase, which may reduce the supply of non-staple foods. Therefore, all regions need to put greater effort into doing a good job in supplying non-staple foods for the New Year and Spring Festival.

The instructions require that the financial committees of major and medium-sized cities and important industrial and mining areas should convene state-owned commercial departments, cooperatives, and relevant units to form a non-staple food supply working group to unify command and coordinate actions. First, they should prepare the New Year's supply plans for state-owned trading companies, cooperatives, and private merchants to avoid blind purchasing and causing stockpiling losses. After the plan is determined, districts should be delineated and procurement tasks should be assigned according to the laws of commodity circulation. State-owned trading companies and cooperatives in producing areas should vigorously assist major cities in completing their procurement tasks. All regions must strengthen the organization of goods sources, ensure the realization of the plan, and adapt to the needs of consumers.

The instructions point out that the financial committees of all regions should conduct a comprehensive inspection of the current prices of non-staple foods in producing and selling areas. On the premise of stabilizing prices, stabilizing people's lives, and taking care of the interests of production, transportation, and consumption, the current prices of non-staple foods should be reasonably adjusted. At the same time, attention should be paid to market management in both producing and selling areas, and private merchants should not be allowed to raise prices and rush to purchase goods. Before the New Year and Spring Festival, it is necessary to firmly grasp the inspection and mobilize workers and citizens to supervise.

The instructions finally require that all regions, due to the concentrated volume of transportation required for the festival, must pay attention to solving temporary transportation difficulties so that some non-staple foods that need to be transported and supplied at any time can be transported on time to ensure supply.

    政务院财政经济委员会发出指示
    要求各地做好新年、春节副食品供应工作
   【新华社十日讯】中央人民政府财政经济委员会最近发出“关于做好新年、春节副食品供应工作的指示”。指示除责成中央商业部和对外贸易部共同负责妥善安排外，并要求各大区、省、市财委和商业厅、局认真领导，集中力量，保证供应人民需要。
    指示首先说，新年、春节快要到来了。历年城乡人民在这一时期内，对副食品的需求量都比平常增多。今年由于国家开始计划建设，城市工矿区人口大量增加，以及人民生活水平的提高，都增加了副食品的消费。另一方面农民在出售余粮后购买力必然增长，对副食品的消费也会增多，这就可能使副食品的货源将会减少。因而各地就需要用更大的力量来做好新年、春节的副食品供应工作。
    指示要求各大、中城市和重要工矿区的财委应召集国营商业部门、合作社以及有关单位组成副食品供应工作组，统一指挥，统一步调，首先做好国营贸易公司，合作社以及私商的年节供应计划，避免各自盲目进货，造成积压损失。在计划确定后，应根据商品流转规律，划定地区，分配收购任务。产区国营贸易公司和合作社应大力协助主要城市完成收购任务。各地必须加强组织货源，保证实现计划，适应消费者的需要。
    指示指出：各地财委应对产区与销区的现行副食品价格进行一次全面检查，在稳定物价，安定人民生活和照顾产、运、消三者利益的前提下，合理地调整现行副食品价格。同时要注意产销两地的市场管理，不准私商抬价抢购。在新年、春节前务须抓紧检查，并发动工人和市民予以监督。
    指示最后要求各地因节日需要运输量比较集中，必须注意解决临时性的运输困难，使某些需要随时运输、随时供应的副食品，得以准时运输，保证供应。
