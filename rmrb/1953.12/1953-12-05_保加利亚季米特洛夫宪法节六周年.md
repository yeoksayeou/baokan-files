    December 5th marks the sixth anniversary of the promulgation of the Dimitrov Constitution of the People's Republic of Bulgaria. Every year on this day, the Bulgarian people celebrate with great enthusiasm and excitement the achievements they have made in consolidating the people's democratic system and building a new socialist life.
    The Dimitrov Constitution of the People's Republic of Bulgaria is a constitution for building socialism. It consolidates the revolutionary achievements of the Bulgarian people, which were the result of the victorious September 9th anti-fascist uprising held with the decisive help of the Soviet Union.
    Like the great Stalin Constitution, which the Soviet people and progressive humanity around the world will celebrate today, the Dimitrov Constitution of Bulgaria establishes the principles of a socialist state. Article 2 of the Dimitrov Constitution states: "All power in the People's Republic of Bulgaria is derived from and belongs to the people." The people's democratic state organs guarantee the participation of all citizens in the administration of the country. "All representative organs of state power shall be elected by citizens on the basis of universal, equal, direct and secret suffrage." and "All citizens of the People's Republic of Bulgaria who have reached the age of eighteen, regardless of sex, nationality, race, religious belief, education, occupation, social origin and property status, shall have the right to vote and to be elected." (Article 3 of the Constitution)
    Chapter VIII of the Constitution stipulates the basic rights and obligations of citizens. According to Article 71 of the Constitution, any privileges based on nationality, origin, belief and property status are abolished. The Constitution proclaims equality between men and women. Guarantees the right to work, rest and education, and the right to freedom of speech and publication. Article 90 of the Constitution further stipulates: "To defend the motherland is the supreme duty and glorious cause of every citizen."
    The characteristic of the Dimitrov Constitution, like the constitutions of all people's democratic countries, lies in its power of action. This is also the basic characteristic of the Stalin Constitution and all Soviet laws. Unlike the bourgeois constitutions which regard the rights of citizens as empty words on paper, the Dimitrov Constitution guarantees the realization of these rights.
    The adoption of the Dimitrov Constitution of Bulgaria in 1947 set off an unprecedented upsurge of labor enthusiasm among the working people of Bulgaria and stimulated the people's creative power and talents. The Bulgarian Communist Party's Fifth Congress was held in the year following the adoption of the Constitution, and this congress determined the Party's central line—to implement national socialist industrialization and to develop agricultural cooperation in the countryside, to build the central line of the socialist economic base. The conference also formulated basic instructions for the first Five-Year National Economic Plan.
    In carrying out the resolutions of the Party Congress, the Bulgarian people made heroic efforts to strengthen their regime and strive to complete and over fulfill the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. Tens of thousands of male and female workers have been promoted to responsible positions in state, social, economic and cultural work. A climax of socialist emulation was set off in enterprises. A broad movement to establish agricultural production cooperatives and a struggle for high yields unfolded in the countryside.
    Thanks to the tenacious work of the working people, the Five-Year National Economic Plan was completed in four years. Bulgaria, a previously backward agricultural country, became an industrial-agricultural country with cooperative and mechanized agriculture by the end of the first Five-Year Plan.
    During the period from 1949 to 1952, more than 700 industrial enterprises were built and rebuilt. Many large factories have started operations, such as the Stalin Chemical Factory, the factories named after Chervenkov and Kolarov, and the Lenin Metallurgical Factory.
    The achievements of the People's Republic of Bulgaria in socialist industrialization are clearly manifested in the fact that the output produced by heavy industry in just fifty-six days of 1952 was equivalent to the entire year's output of heavy industry in 1939.
    The Bulgarian people have also achieved great successes in agriculture. By the end of 1952, 52.3 percent of agriculture had been cooperativized. The land of agricultural production cooperatives accounted for 60.5 percent of all cultivated land. In agriculture, 149 machine tractor stations were working, owning 12,295 tractors and 1,363 combine harvesters.
    In agriculture, the superiority of labor cooperation over individual operation is particularly evident. In 1952, the average yield of agricultural production cooperatives exceeded that of individual farmers by the following amounts: wheat—12.6 percent, corn—35.8 percent, rice—22.1 percent, sunflower—19.8 percent, cotton—20.7 percent, and sugar beets—22.3 percent.
    Due to the achievements made in industrialization and agriculture, the material and cultural living standards of the working people have been greatly improved. The average annual wage of industrial workers in 1952 increased by 38 percent compared with 1939. The people's government has taken enormous measures to improve the lives of the working people and raise their culture. During the Five-Year Plan, 1,000 settlements were electrified, bringing the total to 2,640 settlements—more than half of the country's settlements—electrified.
    All the people enjoyed free medical services, and mothers and children received special care. As a result of this care, the infant mortality rate decreased by 29.5 percent compared with 1939, while the birth rate per thousand people increased from 21.7 percent to 23.3 percent.
    The Bulgarian people have also achieved great successes in education. During the 1952-1953 academic year, more than 99 percent of all children aged seven to fifteen were receiving compulsory education in primary schools. Illiteracy has been almost eliminated among citizens under the age of fifty. In 1952, the number of people studying in higher education institutions increased twofold compared with 1939, and the number of people studying in secondary vocational schools increased six and a half times.
    The people's government is very concerned about the education of ethnic minorities. Compared with 1939, the number of general education schools for the Turkish ethnic group has increased two and a half times. In addition, three normal schools have been opened for Turkish youth, and three classes have been set up in Sofia University, all of which are fully funded by the state.
    The theater has undergone special development in the years since the establishment of the people's government. The number of theaters increased by 50 percent and the number of cinemas doubled during the Five-Year Plan alone. The number of orchestras and choirs increased fivefold. Amateur artistic activities have also achieved great successes. During 1952-1953, 800 groups participated in the inter-regional performance competitions of amateur art.
    The book publishing industry has also seen great development. In 1952, three and a half times more books were published than in 1939. The daily circulation of newspapers has also greatly increased. Before September 9, 1944, the daily circulation of newspapers was 369,000 copies. Now, the circulation of the People's Daily, the organ of the CPC Central Committee alone exceeds 430,000 copies, and the total circulation of national newspapers is nearly one million copies. That is to say, there is one newspaper for every seven people, not including local newspapers.
    During the Five-Year Plan, science and technology made great advances. In 1939, the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences did not have a single scientific research institute, while in 1952 it led thirty-one research institutes with 351 staff members. In science and art, 241 people were awarded the titles of People's Scientist and Artist and Meritorious Scientist and Artist, and 496 people were awarded the Dimitrov Prize. More than 50,000 people have been awarded medals for their outstanding achievements in social, economic and cultural construction, including 42 Heroes of Socialist Labor. In the cause of socialist construction in Bulgaria, thousands of famous figures have grown up from the people, and they have won the love of the working people of the whole country.
    In his speech celebrating the ninth anniversary of the Bulgarian people's uprising on September 9, Comrade Chervenkov stressed: "Only after September 9, 1944, could our country embark on the broad international stage, show its culture, its national achievements and talents, directly understand the culture of other nations and learn from them. And fraternal relations with the people of the Soviet Union, our liberator, of course, occupy a primary position. This connection creates great possibilities for the brilliant future of our country, enabling us to fully absorb their rich experience of world historical significance and absorb the great Russian culture."
    The great economic and cultural achievements made by the Bulgarian people in building a new life are the result of the correct policies of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the people's government, the result of the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and cooperation with the people's democratic countries. These achievements vividly demonstrate the vitality of the people's democratic system and significantly demonstrate the unlimited creative possibilities of the people after they have mastered their own destiny and are constantly developing towards socialism.
    On December 5th—the day of the great Stalin Constitution and the Bulgarian Dimitrov Constitution Day—the Bulgarian people excitedly review the achievements they have made in socialist construction. These achievements are an inspiring force for the Bulgarian people to strive for new and greater achievements in completing the second Five-Year National Economic Plan.
    Under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party headed by our beloved leader Comrade Chervenkov, the Bulgarian people are firmly advancing towards socialism and towards the path of rapidly improving their material and cultural conditions. In the struggle to build socialism and defend their motherland, Bulgaria has received the fraternal support of the Soviet people, the Chinese people and the people of the people's democratic countries. Their struggle to consolidate the economic and defense strength of their motherland has continuously strengthened the camp of peace, democracy and socialism headed by the great Soviet Union.

    保加利亚季米特洛夫宪法节六周年

    十二月五日是保加利亚人民共和国季米特洛夫宪法颁布六周年。每年这一天，保加利亚人民都怀着极大的热情和兴奋，来庆祝他们在巩固人民民主制度和建设社会主义新生活中所取得的成就。
    保加利亚人民共和国季米特洛夫宪法是一部建设社会主义的宪法。它巩固了保加利亚人民的革命成果，这一成果就是在苏联的决定性帮助之下所举行的胜利的九月九日反法西斯起义的结果。
    和苏联人民与全世界进步人类将在今天庆祝的伟大的斯大林宪法一样，保加利亚季米特洛夫宪法确立了社会主义国家的原则。季米特洛夫宪法的第二条写道：“保加利亚人民共和国全部政权，系由人民所产生并属于人民。”人民民主的国家机构保证了全民参加国家的管理工作。“国家政权的一切代表机关，均由公民按普遍、平等、直接及秘密投票法选举之。”而“凡年满十八岁的保加利亚人民共和国公民，不分性别、民族、种族、宗教信仰、教育程度、职业、社会出身及财产状况，皆享有选举权和被选举权。”（宪法第三条）
    在宪法的第八章中规定了公民的基本权利与义务。按照宪法第七十一条的规定，取消基于民族、出身、信仰及财产状况的任何特权。宪法宣告了男女平等。保障了劳动、休息与受教育的权利，言论与出版自由的权利。宪法第九十条又规定：“保卫祖国是每一公民的最高天职与光荣事业。”
    季米特洛夫宪法的特点和所有人民民主国家的宪法一样，就在于它是行动的力量。这也是斯大林宪法和所有苏维埃法律的基本特点。和把公民权利视为纸上空文的资产阶级宪法不同，季米特洛夫宪法保证着这些权利的实现。
    一九四七年保加利亚季米特洛夫宪法的通过，掀起了保加利亚劳动人民的空前的劳动热潮，激发了人民的创造力量与才能。在宪法通过的下一年举行了保加利亚共产党的第五次代表大会，这次大会确定了党的中心路线——实行国家社会主义工业化和在农村中发展农业合作的中心路线，建设社会主义经济基础的中心路线。大会同时也拟定了对于第一个五年国民经济计划的基本指示。
    在执行党的代表大会的决议中，保加利亚人民以英勇的努力来加强自己的政权，争取完成和提前完成五年计划。成千成万的男女工人被提拔到国家工作、社会、经济与文化工作的负责岗位上去。在企业中掀起了社会主义竞赛的高潮。在农村中展开了建立农业生产合作社的广大运动与争取高额产量的斗争。
    由于劳动人民的顽强工作，五年国民经济计划在四年内就完成了。从前落后的农业国保加利亚在第一个五年计划终了时，变成了一个拥有合作化、机械化农业的工业—农业国。
    在一九四九年到一九五二年的期间，建设与改建了七百多个工业企业。许多巨大的工厂已经开工，如斯大林化学工厂，以契尔文科夫、科拉罗夫为名的工厂，和列宁冶金工厂等。
    保加利亚人民共和国在社会主义工业化方面的成就明显地表现于这一事实，即仅仅在一九五二年的五十六天内重工业所出产的产量，就相当于一九三九年全年的重工业产量。
    保加利亚人民在农业方面也获得了巨大的成就。在一九五二年底，农业的百分之五十二点三已经合作化了。农业生产合作社的土地占全部耕地的百分之六十点五。在农业中，有一百四十九个机器拖拉机站工作着，它们拥有一万二千二百九十五架拖拉机和一千三百六十三架联合收割机。
    在农业中，特别明显地表现出了劳动合作对于个体经营的优越性。在一九五二年，农业生产合作社的平均收获量比单干户超过数如下：小麦——百分之十二点六，玉米——百分之三十五点八，大米——百分之二十二点一，向日葵——百分之十九点八，棉花——百分之二十点七，糖萝卜——百分之二十二点三。
    由于在工业化和农业方面所获得的成就，劳动人民的物质与文化生活水平有了大大的提高。产业工人每年的平均工资在一九五二年比一九三九年增加了百分之三十八。人民政权采取了巨大的措施来改善劳动人民的生活与提高他们的文化。在五年计划期间，有一千个居民点实行了电气化，因而总共有二千六百四十个居民点——全国居民点的半数以上实行了电气化。
    全体人民都享受到了免费的医药服务，母亲与孩子们受到了特别的关怀。由于这种关怀，婴儿的死亡率比一九三九年减少了百分之二十九点五，而每千人口的出生率则从百分之二十一点七增加到百分之二十三点三。
    保加利亚人民在教育方面也达到了巨大的成就。在一九五二——一九五三年的学年内，年在七岁至十五岁的全体儿童的百分之九十九以上，都在初级学校中接受义务教育。年在五十岁以下的公民中间已经差不多没有文盲了。一九五二年，在高等学校中学习的人数比一九三九年增加了二倍，在中等职业学校中学习的人数增加了六倍半。
    人民政权非常关怀少数民族的教育。和一九三九年相比，土耳其族的普通教育学校已增加了二倍半，除此以外，还为土耳其族青年开办了三所师范学校，并在索非亚大学里专设了三个班，它们的费用是全部由国家供给的。
    在人民政权成立的年代里，戏剧有了特别的发展。仅仅在五年计划期间，剧院就增加了百分之五十，电影院增加了一倍。管弦乐队与合唱队增加了五倍。业余艺术活动也得到了巨大的成就。在一九五二——一九五三年间有八百个团体参加了业余艺术的区际竞赛会演。
    图书出版事业也有巨大的发展。在一九五二年出版的书籍比一九三九年多三倍半。报纸的每日发行量也大大增加了。一九四四年九月九日以前报纸的每日发行数是三十六万九千份，现在仅保共中央机关报“工人事业报”的发行数就超过了四十三万份，而全国性报纸的发行总数则将近一百万份。也就是说，每七个人中就有一份报纸，而地方报纸还不算在内。
    在五年计划期间，科学与技术有了很大的高涨。在一九三九年时，保加利亚科学院没有一个科学研究所，而在一九五二年它已领导了拥有三百五十一个工作人员的三十一所研究所了。在科学与艺术方面，有二百四十一人获得了人民科学家与艺术家和功勋科学家与艺术家的称号，有四百九十六人荣获季米特洛夫奖金。五万多人因为在社会、经济与文化建设方面有卓越成绩被授予奖章，其中有四十二名是社会主义劳动英雄。在保加利亚的社会主义建设事业中，从人民中成长起了成千个著名的人物，他们得到了全国劳动人民的热爱。
    契尔文科夫同志在庆祝九月九日保加利亚人民起义九周年的演说中，曾经着重指出：“我国只有在一九四四年九月九日以后，才能走上广大的国际舞台，才能显示出自己的文化，自己的民族成就与才干，才能直接了解其他民族的文化并向它们学习。而和我们的解放者苏联人民的兄弟般的联系当然占有首要的地位。这种联系为我国的光辉未来创造了巨大的可能性，使我们能够充分地吸取他们丰富的、具有世界历史意义的经验，吸收伟大的俄罗斯文化。”
    保加利亚人民在建设新生活中所取得的巨大的经济和文化成就，是保加利亚共产党和人民政权正确政策的结果，是苏联的无私援助与和人民民主国家合作的结果。这些成就生动地表明了人民民主制度的生命活力，显著地表明了人民在掌握自己命运以后和不断地向社会主义发展中的无限创造可能性。
    在十二月五日——伟大的斯大林宪法与保加利亚季米特洛夫宪法节这一天，保加利亚人民兴奋地来检阅自己在社会主义建设中所取得的成就。这些成就，是保加利亚人民为完成第二个五年国民经济计划而争取新的更大成就的鼓舞力量。
    在以敬爱的领袖契尔文科夫同志为首的保加利亚共产党的领导之下，保加利亚人民正在坚定地向社会主义、向迅速提高自己的物质与文化状况的道路前进。在争取建成社会主义与保卫自己祖国的斗争中，保加利亚得到了苏联人民、中国人民与人民民主国家人民的兄弟般的支持。他们为巩固自己祖国的经济与国防力量的斗争，不断地加强了以伟大苏联为首的和平、民主与社会主义阵营。
