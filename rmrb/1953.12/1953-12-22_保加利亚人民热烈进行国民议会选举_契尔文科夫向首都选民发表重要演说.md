Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, December 21st—According to TASS news agency, Sofia: The National Assembly elections were held enthusiastically throughout Bulgaria on the 20th. The whole country presented a festive scene on this day. National flags, and portraits of leaders of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the government were hung on the streets, squares, and buildings of cities and villages. Voters everywhere began voting enthusiastically at 7:00 AM local time at the polling stations. In the capital Sofia, the working people enthusiastically voted for the Fatherland Front candidates headed by Bulgarian Council of Ministers Chairman Chervenkov. By 2:00 PM, 95 percent of the voters in Sofia's Chervenkov district had cast their votes. By 7:00 PM, voting had ended in Sofia, Ruse, Plovdiv, Stalin, Dimitrovgrad, and other cities and villages across the country, and the counting of votes had begun.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 21st—According to the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency: Vulko Chervenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the People's Republic of Bulgaria and General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, met with voters in the eighth constituency of Sofia on the 18th and delivered a speech to the voters.

In his speech, Chervenkov first discussed the current international situation. He described the growing strength of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and pointed out: Recently, the Soviet Union has taken a number of practical steps aimed at easing international tensions and peacefully resolving international disputes. However, the US government's policy of force is obstructing the relaxation of international tensions. All peace-loving forces in the world should condemn and defeat the US government's policy of force. In the past four years, the Bulgarian Communist Party and the People's Government have done their best to realize the Bulgarian people's desire for lasting peace and world security. Our policy has been and remains a consistent policy of peace.

A large part of Chervenkov's speech was devoted to the achievements of the Bulgarian people in building socialism and the early completion of the first Five-Year Plan (1949-1953). He said: We already have our own ferrous and non-ferrous metals, chemical, machine-building, and electrical equipment industries. Our production of daily necessities in 1952 has more than doubled compared to 1948. Due to the great achievements of socialist construction, it is possible for us to put the task of greatly improving the material and cultural living standards of the people on the agenda. In order to continue the proportional industrialization of the country, and taking into account cooperation with the Soviet Union and other People's Democracies, the Party and the government have stipulated in the Second Five-Year Plan that investment in agricultural development will be more than double that of the First Five-Year Plan, investment in light industry and the food industry will be more than double, investment in public buildings will be nearly three times, and investment in housing construction will be nearly four times. Before the completion of the Second Five-Year Plan, the Party and the government will greatly increase the real wages of workers and staff by continuously reducing product costs and continuously reducing retail prices. By 1957, the Party and the government will enable the Bulgarian people to buy more than twice as much sugar and rice as in 1952, nearly one and a half times as much meat, nearly four times as much lard, twice as many potatoes, one and a half times as much cotton fabric, nearly twice as much woolen fabric, more than twice as much silk fabric, more than twice as many leather shoes, and nearly twice as much soap, and nearly six times as many radios. During the Second Five-Year Plan, the Party and the government will also take a series of steps to further improve the people's material and cultural life, public health, and people's education.

Finally, Chervenkov called on the voters to unanimously vote for the candidates of the Fatherland Front and continue to struggle for peace, for the socialist construction of the motherland, and for the happy life of the working people in urban and rural areas.

    契尔文科夫向首都选民发表重要演说
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社索非亚消息：保加利亚全国各地在二十日热烈地举行了国民议会的选举。这一天全国呈现一片节日景象，各城市和乡村的街道、广场和建筑物上，都悬挂了国旗、保加利亚共产党和政府领袖们的肖像。各地选民在当地时间七时整，都兴高彩烈地开始到选举站投票。在首都索非亚，劳动人民都热情地投票选举以保加利亚部长会议主席契尔文科夫为首的祖国阵线候选人。到下午二时，索非亚市的契尔文科夫区已有百分之九十五的选民投完了票。下午七时，索非亚、鲁西、普罗夫迪夫、斯大林、季米特洛夫格拉德以及全国其他城市和乡村，都已投票结束，并开始计算票数。

    契尔文科夫在演说中首先论述目前的国际形势。他叙述了以苏联为首的和平民主阵营日益强大的情况，并指出：最近苏联采取了若干旨在缓和国际紧张局势与和平解决国际争端的实际步骤。但是，美国政府的武力政策却障碍着国际紧张局势的缓和。全世界一切和平力量都应该斥责美国政府的武力政策，并使其失败。在过去四年中，保加利亚共产党和人民政府已经尽力来实现保加利亚人民争取持久和平和世界安全的愿望。我们的政策过去是、现在仍是一贯的和平政策。
    契尔文科夫的演说有一大部分谈到保加利亚人民在建设社会主义方面所获得的成就，以及第一个五年计划（一九四九—一九五三年）提前完成的情况。他说：我们已经有了自己的黑色和有色金属、化学、机器制造和电气设备工业。我们一九五二年的日用品生产量已比一九四八年增加了一倍。由于社会主义建设的巨大成就，使得我们有可能把大大地提高人民的物质和文化生活水平的工作提上日程。为了继续按比例地进行国家工业化，并考虑到和苏联及各人民民主国家的合作，党和政府在第二个五年计划中规定把农业发展的投资增为第一个五年计划的二倍多，轻工业和食品工业的投资增为二倍多，公共建筑的投资将近三倍，住房建筑的投资将近四倍。党和政府并将在第二个五年计划完成以前，以不断减低产品成本、不断减低零售价格的方法来大大地提高职工的实际工资。党和政府将使保加利亚人民到一九五七年时，能比一九五二年多买糖和稻米各一倍多，肉类近一倍半，猪油近四倍，马铃薯一倍，棉织品一倍半多，毛织品近二倍，丝织品一倍多，皮鞋一倍多，肥皂近二倍，收音机近六倍。在第二个五年计划期间，党和政府还将采取一系列的步骤来进一步改进人民的物质文化生活、公共卫生和人民教育。
    契尔文科夫最后号召选民一致投票选举祖国阵线的候选人，为和平、为祖国的社会主义建设、为城乡劳动人民的幸福生活而继续奋斗。
