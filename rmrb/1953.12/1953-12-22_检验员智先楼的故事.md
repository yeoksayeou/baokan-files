    The Story of Inspector Zhi Xianlou
    By Our Reporter Jin Yukun
    On the desk of the Technical Inspection Section of the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory, there is a thick stack of letters from workshop workers praising the inspection personnel.
    These letters are filled with enthusiastic words: "Thanks to your active help, our product quality has reached 100%", "In the past, we were afraid of your arrival, but now we look forward to your arrival"! Why are the workers in this factory so friendly to the inspection personnel? There is a very vivid story behind it, and the protagonist of the story is the inspector Zhi Xianlou.
    In the past, the inspection personnel of the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Factory worked like this: many of them sat in the office all day long, and their main task was to "guard the gate". Workers brought the processed parts to the door, and the inspectors would "let it pass" if it was qualified, and "block it back" if it was unqualified. At the beginning of this year, in order to improve inspection work, they also set up inspection stations in the workshop. The inspection station did not fundamentally change this situation, but simply moved the office from the section to the workshop.
    Some inspection personnel did not change their wrong views and unilaterally believed that I represent the state, and my task is to "find fault". Some workers felt unhappy when the inspection personnel only picked on mistakes. If they could not complete the task, they would also get a bad name. In this way, some inspection personnel and workers became more and more incompatible, and some even developed to the point of mutual opposition. If the inspector said the hole was too big, some workers would add some oil to cover it up; if the inspector said the shaft was too small, some workers would add a ring; when the section was idle in the morning, some workers would not send the product for inspection, and would wait until they were about to get off work before sending it to sneak through. The inspectors were busy all day long, but the number of defective products increased day by day.
    The inspection personnel were full of resentment. If they let the defective products pass, they would not have fulfilled their responsibilities; if they did not let them pass, the workers would be unhappy. The year before last, there was an inspector named Li Yumei who helped the iron workshop improve its tools. The trade union thought it was very good and praised him, but some workers strongly opposed him, and as a result, it ended in "let's forget about it". What was originally a good thing turned into a bad thing, and from then on, the inspection personnel became even more discouraged.
    Zhi Xianlou is an old worker with more than 20 years of experience. After being transferred to this new job, he was full of enthusiasm to do the work well. However, the inspection work was just as tricky for him. Zhi Xianlou is an impatient person. In May of this year, when he inspected the large body of the rolling mill lathe, the quality did not meet the requirements. "Such a large item is scrapped again!" The more he thought about it, the more distressed he became, so he had a quarrel with Zhang Xiyuan, the leader of the drilling group. After this quarrel, it became even more difficult for Zhi Xianlou to work in the future, and slowly he developed a sense of retreat. He thought: "In the past, everyone was good at work, highly skilled, and respected; now it has come to the point where there are 'enemies' everywhere, so why bother! Anyway, this job cannot be done for a lifetime."
    Once Zhi Xianlou's thinking was blocked, his head became dizzy, his heart became confused, and he could not eat. Finally, he fell ill.
    He was sick for two months, and the trade union sent him to a sanatorium for recuperation, and everyone went to see him every two or three days. When he returned to the workshop after his illness, the situation was different. Everyone was engaged in the production increase and economy campaign, and everyone was thinking of ways to improve production, make operation plans, and sign contact contracts. Everyone's morale was very high, and the section was also discussing very lively. When Zhi Xianlou saw this, his heart immediately brightened. He thought: "I have to catch up with everyone! I can't just think about not doing this job. Perhaps it's not that the inspectors and workers can't get along, but that there is no good way." Zhi Xianlou thought to himself: "There are good ways, but I haven't looked for them!"
    In the past, when inspection personnel inspected large pieces, they would go to the machine tool, because large pieces weighed several tons and could not be sent to the station for inspection like small pieces. This method had many advantages, because each process was inspected, and any problems could be seen immediately. For this reason, there were indeed fewer large pieces that were scrapped. Zhi Xianlou thought of this method: "Since large pieces can be done this way, why can't small pieces be done this way? If this is done, there is no need to be desperately busy when busy and panicky when idle."
    Zhi Xianlou was very happy after thinking of this good method - the process patrol inspection method! He carried a small can every day, turning from this machine tool to that machine tool. People sat in the office to "guard the gate", but he ran to the workshop, bending over to inspect each process, just like a doctor examining a person's body. When the product was qualified, he would happily mark it with red.
    Although this approach is good, some people were not used to it at the beginning. Once, Zhi Xianlou ran to Yang Shixiu in the Ma Lu group. When the young man saw Zhi Xianlou squatting in front of his machine tool, he said impatiently: "Lao Zhi! Why are you always talking nonsense in front of my machine tool?" "Don't come to the machine tool to nag!"
   "It's fine if I send it to you for inspection after I'm done, you don't need to manage it here!"
    This time Zhi Xianlou was not like the last time. He knew that the gap between the inspection personnel and the workers was too deep in the past, and it would be difficult to change it all at once, so he had to put in more effort. Zhi Xianlou insisted on doing it no matter what others said. Zhi Xianlou was determined to make the workers understand that although it was a bit of trouble, it was of great benefit to production. When the Ma Lu group was making water tank sleeves, the drawings vaguely said that the tolerance could be less than one millimeter, but in fact, half a millimeter could not be wrong. Taking some time, Zhi Xianlou took Wu Yugui from their group to the assembly workshop to see. Sure enough, if they did it according to the old method, they would have to rework it. Wu Yugui believed Zhi Xianlou's words, and after returning to publicize it, the workers in the Ma Lu group no longer complained about the trouble.
    Although the workers in the processing workshop make parts every day, even though they have made thousands of parts, they do not fully understand what the part is for? Where is it installed? Because of this, they are often not easy to figure out the key points of quality. The places that need to be regular are not regular, and the places that do not need to be regular are regular.
    Zhi Xianlou knew that this was where the workers urgently needed help. When the Sun Huanbing group was making transmission shafts, Zhi Xianlou told them: the three positioning places on the upper side actually do not play any role, and the workers used to grind them very smoothly, wasting power. The part of the ball on the top is the key place, but the workers just don't pay attention to it, which affects the quality. After he said this, the workers had a number in their minds when they worked.
    Zhi Xianlou believes that it is not enough to just give pointers. As long as he can do it, he must also help them solve some specific difficulties. When the Sun Huanbing group was making crossheads to the third process, Zhi Xianlou picked it up and took a look. He quickly said to Sun Huanbing: "Lao Sun, come and see, the center eye is off by more than one millimeter!" Sun Huanbing stopped the car and immediately asked the foreman to come and study it. The main problem was that the center point could not be seen clearly. Zhi Xianlou thought that if there was a template, it would be much easier to master, and he immediately drew a pattern for them. Sure enough, with the template, the workers first found the center distance on one side, and then turned the other end, and they no longer felt it difficult.
    The Sun Huanbing group has nine lathes. In the past, all nine lathes produced defective products. People thought that this group was full of young people, the technology was too low to do well, and they lost confidence in this group. However, in August, this famous "defective product group", due to the production increase and economy campaign, and due to the role played by the process patrol inspection method, completely eliminated defective products, and the quality reached 100%. At the same time, because the inspection personnel went deep into the workshop, it saved everyone the time wasted in sending inspections and waiting for inspections, which played a great role in ensuring balanced production.
    When the process patrol inspection method was first implemented, some people worried about how the inspection personnel could handle it by checking each process! However, this is not the case, because the phenomenon of "loose before and tight after" in the past has changed, and the work efficiency of the inspection personnel has also been greatly improved. Although the task in the third quarter increased by two or three times compared with the first quarter, the number of inspection personnel not only did not increase, but instead changed from three people inspecting two groups in the past to one person inspecting two groups, and the work became easier and more enjoyable. Inspection personnel are welcomed everywhere, and people affectionately call them "doctors".

    检验员智先楼的故事
    本报记者　金雨困
    在太原矿山机器厂技术检查科的桌子上，有一厚叠来自车间工人赞扬检验人员的信件。
    在这些信件中充满了热情洋溢的词句：“由于你们的积极帮助，我们的产品质量达到了百分之百”，“过去我们怕你们来，现在我们盼着你们来”！为什么这厂里的工人对检验人员这样亲切呢？这里面有一个很生动的故事，而故事的主人翁就是检验员智先楼。
    在过去，太原矿山机器厂的检验人员是这样工作的：他们许多人整天坐在办公室里，主要的任务就是“把关”。工人把加工件送上门来，检验员见合格就把它“放过去”，不合格的就“挡回去”。今年年初，为了改进检验工作，他们也曾在车间设立了检验站。检验站也没有根本上改变这种情况，不过是把办公室由科里搬到车间而已。
    有的检验人员没有改变错误的看法，片面地认为我是代表国家的，我的任务就是“挑毛病”。有的工人看到检验人员尽挑错，心里好不高兴，任务完成不了，还要落一个不光荣的名声。就这样，有些检验人员和工人越来越不对劲，甚至有的发展到互相对立的程度了。检验人员说眼子大了，有的工人就加点油糊住：检验人员说轴太小了，有的工人就加上个圈；上午科里清闲的时候，有的工人不把产品送去检查，等到快下班了才送去混过关。检验人员一天忙得不得开交，废品还是一天一天的增加。
    检验人员别了一肚子气。要是把废品放过去了，自己没有尽到责任；不放过去，工人又不高兴。前年，有个检验员叫李玉梅，帮助铁工车间改进了工具，工会认为很好，就表扬了他，有些工人激烈地反对他，结果，闹了个“算了吧”的收场。本来是好事，却变成了坏事，从此，检验人员更泄气了。
    智先楼是个有二十多年经验的老工人。他被调到这个新的工作岗位以后，满怀热情地要把工作做好。但是，检验工作对他来说，也是一样的棘手。智先楼是个急性子的人，今年五月，他在检验轧滚车床大身时，质量不合乎要求。“这样的大体货又报废了！”他越想越痛惜，就和钻床组组长张喜元吵了一架。这一吵，智先楼以后的工作就更难做了，慢慢地他就产生了一种退缩思想。他想：“过去谁不是工作好、技术高，受人尊敬；现在弄得到处是‘冤家’，这又何苦来！反正这个工作不能干一辈子。”
    智先楼思想一不通，头也昏了，心也乱了，饭也吃不下，终于，他病倒了。
    一病就是两个月，工会把他送到休养所去修养，大家三天两头去看他。他病好后回到车间，情况可不同了。大家都在闹增产节约竞赛，都在想道道儿把生产提高，搞作业计划，订联系合同。大家的情绪都很高，科里也讨论得顶热闹。智先楼一看，心也马上开朗起来了。他想：“我也得跟着大家往前赶呀！不能光想着不干这个工作，恐怕不是检验员和工人搞不到一起，而是没有个好办法。智先楼心里盘算：“好办法是有的，就是没去找！”
    过去检验人员检查大件活时，都是跑到机床上去，因为大件活有好几吨重，不能像小件活一样送到站上去检查。这个办法就有许多好处，因为一道工序一道工序的检查，那一道出了毛病，也能马上看出来。由于这个缘故，大件活报废的的确比较少。智先楼想起了这个办法：“既然大件活可以这样做，为什么小件活就不能这样做呢？这样做了，也用不着忙时忙得要命、闲时闲得发慌了。”
    智先楼想出了这个好办法——工序巡回检验法以后，可高兴呢！他天天提着一个小罐，从这部机床转到那部机床。人家坐在办公室里“把关”，他却跑到车间去，俯着身子一道工序一道工序的检查，就像医生检查人的身体一样。当产品合格时，他就满心高兴地抹上一道红色。
    这种做法虽然好，但在开始的时候，总有一些人不习惯。有一次，智先楼跑到马禄小组杨世秀那里，那个小伙子一看智先楼蹲在他的机床前，很不耐烦地说：“老智！你干什么老是在我的机床前面说长道短的？”“不要跑到机床边上来噜囌吧！”
  “等我全干完了，送去让你检查好了，这里用不着你来多管！”
    智先楼这次可不像上次一样了。他知道过去检验人员和工人隔阂太深了，一下子很难改过来，得多使上点劲儿。智先楼不管别人怎样说，还是坚持着干。智先楼打定了主意，要使工人了解虽然受些麻烦，对生产可有很大好处。马禄小组做水缸套筒时，图纸上含糊地说公差可以小于一公厘，其实半公厘也差不得。抽个空儿，智先楼把他们组里的武玉贵带到装配车间去看。果然不错，如果按老法子做的话，就要大返工。武玉贵相信了智先楼的话，回来一宣传，以后，马禄小组的工人再也不嫌麻烦了。
    加工车间的工人虽然天天在做零件，尽管他们做了成千上万件的活，但是，他们对这个零件作什么用？装配在那里？都不十分了解。正因为这样，他们往往不容易摸透质量的要点所在。需要规矩的地方不规矩，不需要的地方却规矩起来了。
    智先楼知道这就是工人迫切需要帮助的地方。孙焕秉小组做传动轴时，智先楼就告诉他们：在上边三个定位的地方，实际上是不起什么作用的，过去工人车得挺光，浪费了力量。上边滚珠的部分，是要害的地方，工人恰恰就不注意，结果影响了质量。他这样一说，工人干起活来心中就有了个数。
    智先楼认为光指点也不够，只要自己能够做到的，还要帮助他们解决些具体困难。孙焕秉小组做十字头做到第三道工序，智先楼拿起来一看，他连忙对孙焕秉说：“老孙，你过来看看，中心眼偏了一公厘多！”孙焕秉停下车来，马上把工长找来研究，找到了主要问题是看不清中心点。智先楼一想，如果有个样板，掌握起来就简单多了，他马上给他们画了一个图样。果然，有了样板，工人先找出一边的中心距离，再车另外一端，就不感到困难了。
    孙焕秉这个小组有九部车床，过去九部车床部部出废品，人家认为这个小组尽是年轻人，技术太低无法搞好，对这个小组都丧失了信心。但是，八月份这个有名的“废品小组”，由于增产节约竞赛的缘故，由于工序巡回检验法所起的作用，全部消灭了废品，质量达到了百分之百。同时，因为检验人员深入到车间去，节省了大家送检验和等检验所浪费的时间，对保证均衡生产起了很大作用。
    开始实行工序巡回检验法的时候，有的人担心这样一道工序一道工序的检查，检验人员怎么能忙得过来！但是，事实并不是这样，因为过去的“前松后紧”的现象改变了，检验人员的工作效率也大大提高了。虽然第三季度的任务较第一季度增加了两、三倍，检验人员不但没有增加，反而由过去三个人检查两个组，改为一个人检查两个组，工作也变得轻松愉快了。检验人员到处受欢迎，人们亲热地称呼他们为“医生”。
