Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 6th: The United Nations General Assembly Political Committee concluded its discussion on Burma's accusation of aggression by the Kuomintang clique on December 4th, according to TASS, New York.

    The delegations of Australia, India, Indonesia, Canada, New Zealand, Norway, the United Kingdom, Uruguay, and Sweden submitted a joint proposal, advocating that relevant parties continue to make efforts to withdraw "foreign troops" from Burma, or disarm and detain them. The proposal also strongly recommended that all countries no longer provide any assistance to the aforementioned troops, enabling them to continue to remain on Burmese territory or to take more hostile actions against Burma. The proposal also expressed gratitude to the United States and Thailand, which allegedly made efforts to promote the withdrawal of Kuomintang elements, while in reality, the United States is trying to undermine the withdrawal work.

    The US representative, together with the Thai representative, proposed an amendment to this proposal, suggesting that the "Joint Military Committee" established in Bangkok could report to the United Nations General Assembly on the situation in Burma. This illegally established committee has a representative of the Kuomintang clique, a Thai representative, and is chaired by a US representative. Burma has refused to participate in the work of this committee.

    Polish representative Katz-Suchy spoke, saying that the United States should be held responsible for the Kuomintang bandit aggression against Burma. The US government armed the Kuomintang bandits in Burma. US planes have been and continue to be in regular contact between Burma and the Kuomintang bandits in Taiwan.

    The Polish representative emphasized that the Kuomintang clique, with the help of the United States, wants to threaten shipping in the Far East. From August to October this year, Kuomintang bandits attacked Greek, Finnish, Italian, and British merchant ships, as well as the Polish merchant ship "Praca."

    The Kuomintang pirates detained the "Praca," looted the cargo, arrested the crew, and threatened to hand them over to a "military court" for trial. The Polish government has evidence to prove that US planes participated in the attack on the "Praca." Katz-Suchy said that the Polish government demands that the US government take measures to release the "Praca" and its crew, and return the cargo. The Polish government also reserves the right to demand compensation for losses from the US government.

    Indonesian representative Hanifa said that the progress of the work of withdrawing Kuomintang elements is unsatisfactory. He emphasized that the US representative's promise to withdraw 2,000 Kuomintang troops has not been fulfilled. Moreover, even the withdrawal of 2,000 troops will not solve the problem. The number of Kuomintang troops operating in Burma is more than 12,000. Recent news from Burma indicates that Kuomintang bandits are reorganizing and intensifying their plunder of Burmese residents. He said that the joint proposal "only partially reflects the concerns of Asian countries" about the Kuomintang's aggression against Burma. The Indian and Indonesian representatives pointed out that the nature of this proposal is very mild and opposed the amendments proposed by the United States and Thailand.

    The representatives of Guatemala, Mexico, and Yugoslavia also pointed out that the proposal was weak, but they said they would vote in favor of it.

    The US representative tried to defend the US's failure to fulfill its promise to withdraw 2,000 Kuomintang troops in his speech.

    Soviet representative Malik supported the Polish representative's protest against the piratical attacks by Kuomintang elements. He said that the actions of Kuomintang elements under the protection of the US Air and Naval forces flagrantly violated an important principle of international law—freedom of navigation—and complicated the already tense international situation. Malik said that everyone knows that the Chiang Kai-shek clique is a puppet of the US military. Therefore, the United States must bear moral responsibility for the disruption of the withdrawal of Kuomintang troops from Burma, and for the fact that Kuomintang bandits are carrying out piratical attacks on foreign ships on the high seas without being stopped. The United Nations must take note of this latest act of aggression and condemn those who have taken this act of aggression.

    Malik said that the Soviet delegation expresses its sympathy to the people of Burma and firmly condemns those who harbor these bandits, fund them, and supply them with weapons and ammunition. The Soviet delegation firmly demands that measures be taken to immediately implement the resolution of the Seventh Session of the United Nations General Assembly regarding the withdrawal of Kuomintang troops from Burma.

    The Soviet delegation pointed out that the nine-nation proposal is unsatisfactory, and the Soviet delegation suggested that the section expressing gratitude to the United States and Thailand be deleted from this proposal, otherwise the Soviet delegation would not be able to support this proposal. Malik pointed out that the United States has in fact worked to undermine the completion of this work. Leaving this section will only have a masking effect, allowing the Kuomintang clique's armed aggression against Burma to continue. The Soviet representative also opposed the amendments proposed by the United States and Thailand.

    The Polish and Czechoslovak representatives supported the Soviet suggestion.

    Burmese representative U Myint Thein also spoke against the amendments proposed by the United States and Thailand. He said that the work of withdrawing Kuomintang bandits from Burma is proceeding very unsatisfactorily. What has been withdrawn is mainly the disabled, women, children, and some young recruits. The Burmese representative emphasized that if the United States really intended to resolve the troop withdrawal issue, it could have ordered the Taiwan Kuomintang to withdraw its troops from Burma long ago. He said that the joint proposal is "very weak" and is a "mixture of honey and castor oil." But he said that if there is no other proposal, he would vote in favor of this proposal.

    The Soviet proposal to delete the section expressing gratitude to the United States and Thailand from the proposal was rejected by the US-UK bloc. The Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries delegations voted in favor, and Syria and Afghanistan abstained.

    Subsequently, the nine-nation proposal was passed. The Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries delegations abstained.

    The amendments proposed by the United States and Thailand were not put to a vote because the US representative had to withdraw the amendments in view of the criticism from many representatives.

    联大政委会结束关于缅甸控诉蒋匪侵略案的讨论
    苏波等国代表谴责美国支持蒋匪海盗活动
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社纽约五日讯：联合国大会政治委员会，于十二月四日结束了关于缅甸控诉国民党集团侵略案的讨论。
    澳大利亚、印度、印度尼西亚、加拿大、新西兰、挪威、英国、乌拉圭与瑞典的代表团提出了一个联合提案，主张有关方面继续努力，使“外国军队”撤出缅甸，或把他们解除武装，予以拘禁。这个提案还坚决建议所有国家不要再给予上述军队任何援助，使他们得以继续留在缅甸领土上，或使他们得以对缅甸采取更多的敌对行动。这个提案同时还对美国与泰国表示谢意。据说，这两个国家曾作了努力来促使国民党分子撤退。而实际上，美国是正设法破坏撤退工作的。
    美国代表与泰国代表一道对这个提案提出了一个修正案，建议设于曼谷的“联合军事委员会”可以就缅甸情况向联合国大会提出报告。这个非法成立的委员会有一个国民党集团的代表，一个泰国代表，而由一个美国代表担任主席。缅甸已拒绝参加这个委员会的工作。
    波兰代表卡茨—苏希发言。他说：美国要为国民党匪帮侵略缅甸负责。美国政府把缅甸境内的国民党匪帮的武装配备起来。美国飞机曾经在而且继续在缅甸和台湾的国民党匪帮之间作定期的联络工作。
    波兰代表着重指出：国民党集团在美国的帮助下，想威胁远东的航运。从今年八月到十月，国民党土匪攻击过希腊、芬兰、意大利和英国的商船以及波兰商船“布拉卡号”。
    国民党海盗扣留了“布拉卡号”，抢走了货物，逮捕了船员，并威胁说要把他们交“军事法庭”审讯。波兰政府有证据可以证明，美国飞机参加了对“布拉卡号”的袭击。卡茨—苏希说，波兰政府要求美国政府采取措施来释放“布拉卡号”及其船员，发还货物。波兰政府并保留向美国政府要求赔偿损失的权利。
    印度尼西亚代表汉尼法说，撤退国民党分子的工作的进行情况不能令人满意。他着重指出，美国代表所作的撤出二千名国民党军队的诺言还没有履行。而且，即使撤出二千名军队也还不能解决问题。在缅甸境内活动的国民党军队人数在一万二千名以上。最近从缅甸来的消息说明，国民党土匪正在整编，并正加紧对缅甸居民的掠夺。他说：联合提案“只是部分反映了亚洲国家”对国民党分子侵略缅甸的忧虑。印度与印度尼西亚代表指出这个提案的性质十分温和，并反对美国和泰国的修正案。
    危地马拉、墨西哥与南斯拉夫代表也指出这个提案没有力量，但是他们表示将投赞成票。
    美国代表在发言中想为美国没有履行撤出二千名国民党军队的诺言辩护。
    苏联代表马立克支持波兰代表对国民党分子海盗式的袭击的抗议。他说：国民党分子的这种在美国海空军庇护下的行动，悍然破坏了国际法中的一个重要原则——航海自由，并且使已经很紧张的国际局势更加复杂。马立克说：大家都知道蒋介石集团是美国军方的一个傀儡。因此，把国民党军队撤出缅甸的工作遭到破坏，以及国民党匪帮在公海上对外国船只进行海盗式的袭击而不受制止，美国都要负道义上的责任。联合国必须注意到这个最近的侵略行动，并谴责那些采取这个侵略行动的人。
    马立克说：苏联代表团对缅甸人民表示同情，并坚决谴责那些庇护这些匪帮、资助他们并供应他们武器和弹药的人。苏联代表团坚决要求采取措施来立即执行联合国第七届大会关于把国民党军队撤出缅甸的决议。
    苏联代表团指出：九国提案是不能令人满意的，苏联代表团建议：在这个提案中删去关于对美国和泰国表示谢意的一节，否则苏联代表团就不能支持这个提案。马立克指出：事实上美国曾致力于破坏这项工作的完成。留下这一节，只能发生掩饰的作用，使国民党集团对缅甸的武装侵略得以继续下去。苏联代表也反对美国和泰国的修正案。
    波兰与捷克斯洛伐克代表支持苏联的建议。
    缅甸代表吴敏登也发言反对美国和泰国的修正案。他说，从缅甸撤出国民党匪帮的工作，进行得非常不能令人满意。撤出的主要是些残废者、妇女、儿童和一些年纪太小的新兵。缅甸代表着重指出，假如美国真是有意解决撤兵问题，它早就可以叫台湾国民党从缅甸撤出军队了。他说，联合提案“非常没有力量”，是“蜜糖和蓖麻油的混合物”。但是他说，如果没有别的提案，他要投票赞成这个提案。
    苏联提出的主张从提案中删去向美国与泰国表示谢意的一节的建议被美英集团否决了。苏联及人民民主国家代表团投赞成票，叙利亚、阿富汗弃权。
    接着，通过了九国提案。苏联及人民民主国家的代表团弃权。
    美国与泰国的修正案没有交付表决，因为美国代表鉴于许多代表的抨击，不得不撤回这个修正案。
