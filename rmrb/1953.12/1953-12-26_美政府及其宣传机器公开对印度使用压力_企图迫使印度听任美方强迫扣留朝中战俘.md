Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 24th: Our special correspondent reports: The first task on the U.S. side's agenda right now is to quickly realize the conspiracy of forcibly detaining more than 20,000 Korean and Chinese POWs. To achieve this goal, the U.S. side insists on interpreting "expiration" and does not hesitate to abandon U.S. POWs who have not applied for repatriation. The U.S. ruling group's "Washington Post" stated unabashedly in an editorial on the 22nd, reflecting official intentions: "Concern for the fate of the twenty-two American prisoners and South Korean prisoners who refuse to return should not obscure the larger issue: the release of the thousands upon thousands of anti-communist prisoners of war who refuse to be repatriated to North Korea and Communist China."

The U.S. government and its propaganda machine openly exert pressure on India, attempting to force it to comply with the U.S.'s destructive policy of forcibly detaining POWs. Following Dean's tyrannical order that Indian troops must withdraw by midnight on January 22nd next year, at which time the POWs must be "released," U.S. Far East Commander-in-Chief Hull went to Korea to discuss with Indian Chairman Timayya of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission the so-called "plan to release POWs" and the issue of "transporting Indian troops back home." Subsequently, American newspapers also took coordinated action. The "Washington Post" editorial on the 22nd is an example.

The "Washington Post" insisted that POWs deprived by the U.S. side of the right to be heard and to apply for repatriation must "revert to civilians" on January 22nd and threatened India barbarously not to object to the U.S.'s plan to forcibly detain POWs according to a predetermined timetable. It said: "If measures are taken to extend the detention period, it would be tantamount to completely losing India's past good performance as a POW custodian. This would arouse the revulsion of the free world and create incalculably more difficulties in the relationship between India and the United States regarding military assistance to Pakistan... We hope Nehru will consider the serious unfortunate consequences that may be caused by artificial delays." This shameless public threat by the United States, using the U.S.-Pakistan military alliance against India, an Asian power with over 300 million people, completely exposes the ugly intentions of the U.S. imperialists: to turn the Asian people into slaves and victims of the U.S. aggressive policy. The U.S. imperialists will inevitably suffer the serious unfortunate consequences of this conspiracy.

    美政府及其宣传机器公开对印度使用压力
    企图迫使印度听任美方强迫扣留朝中战俘
   【新华社开城二十四日电】本社特派记者报道：目前美方日程中的第一项工作就是要从速实现强迫扣留两万多名朝中战俘的阴谋。为了达到这一目的，美方坚持解释“期满”，不惜把未申请遣返的美方战俘抛弃。美国统治集团的“华盛顿邮报”二十二日在一篇反映官方意图的社论里毫不隐讳地说：“对拒绝回来的二十二名美国俘虏以及南朝鲜俘虏命运的关怀，不应当使人模糊了这个更大的问题：释放拒绝遣返去北朝鲜和共产党中国的成千上万名反共战俘。”
    美国官方及其宣传机器公开对印度使用压力，企图迫使它顺从美国强迫扣留战俘的破坏政策。继迪安横暴命令印度部队必须在明年一月二十二日午夜撤退、届时战俘必须“释放”之后，远东美军总司令赫尔又前往朝鲜与中立国遣返委员会的印度主席蒂迈雅商谈所谓“释放战俘的计划”以及把印度部队“运送回国”的问题。跟着，美国报纸也采取配合行动。“华盛顿邮报”二十二日的社论是一个例证。
      “华盛顿邮报”一口咬定被美方剥夺听取解释和申请遣返权利的战俘必须在一月二十二日“恢复为平民”，并横蛮地恫吓印度不得对美方按照预定时间表来强迫扣留战俘的计划表示异议。它说：“如果采取延长拘留期限的措施，就等于使印度作为战俘看管者的以往的良好成绩完全丧失。这就会引起自由世界的反感，并在印度与美国对军事援助巴基斯坦一事的关系上造成不可估计的更多困难。……我们希望尼赫鲁将对人为的耽搁可能引起的严重不幸后果予以考虑。”美国这种恬不知耻的公开以美巴军事同盟来对有着三万万以上人口的亚洲大国——印度进行威胁的作法，彻底暴露了美帝国主义者的丑恶居心：把亚洲人民变成美国侵略政策的奴仆和牺牲品。美帝国主义者必将为它的这种阴谋而自食其严重不幸后果。
