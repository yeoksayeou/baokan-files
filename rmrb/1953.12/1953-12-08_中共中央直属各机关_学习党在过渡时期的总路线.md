    Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Directly Affiliated Organs
    Study the Party's General Line During the Transition Period

    All personnel of the organs directly affiliated with the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China have been studying the Party's general line and general tasks during the transition period since December 1st.

    In the past three months, comrades in the high and intermediate level groups participating in theoretical study in the organs directly affiliated with the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China have studied Chapter 9 of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)." Individual units combined the study of Chapter 9 of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)" with the experience of Soviet economic construction to study the general line. This is of great help to the current study of the general line.

    The Party Committee of the Organs Directly Affiliated to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has made the following provisions for this study: The purpose of the study is to enable all staff to have a clear understanding of the Party's general line and general tasks during the transition period. In the study, it is necessary to combine the actual situation of each organ to criticize various incorrect ideas, thereby improving the ideological and work level of all staff. Therefore, comrades who originally participated in the high-level and intermediate-level groups of theoretical study should carefully read the designated documents on the basis of studying Chapter 9 of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)", and conduct discussions in combination with their own thoughts and work. For comrades in the primary group, each organ should organize reports on the general line and general tasks, and organize them to study in conjunction with Chapters 1, 2, and 3 of the "Reader on Common Knowledge of Economic Construction." For comrades participating in cultural studies, each organ shall designate a person to give several popular lectures on the general line and general tasks, and organize everyone to discuss.

    In order to better carry out the study, on November 28, the Party Committee of the Organs Directly Affiliated to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of party member cadres, and Comrade Yang Shangkun, secretary of the Party Committee, made a mobilization report for the study. In his report, Comrade Yang Shangkun expounded the Party's general line during the transition period and the various policy issues related to it. He called on the party member cadres present to work hard and earnestly study the general line, carry out their work in accordance with the spirit of the general line, and propagate to the masses anytime and anywhere; examine and criticize their own thoughts and work in the study in light of the documents, and strive to realize the Party's general line during the transition period.

    At present, all organs directly affiliated to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China have made specific arrangements in accordance with the Party Committee's plan, and organized all staff to study the general line. In order to enable comrades to better understand the Party's general line and general tasks during the transition period, the Party Committee of the Organs Directly Affiliated to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held a study report meeting on December 5, and Comrade Liao Luyan made a report on the issue of the socialist transformation of agriculture.

    中共中央直属各机关
    学习党在过渡时期的总路线
    中国共产党中央直属各机关全体工作人员，已自十二月一日起进行关于党在过渡时期的总路线和总任务的学习。
    最近三个月来，中共中央直属机关参加理论学习的高、中级组同志都学习了“联共（布）党史”第九章。有个别单位在学习“联共（布）党史”第九章时，曾结合苏联经济建设的经验进行了总路线的学习。这对目前的总路线学习有很大的帮助。
    中共中央直属机关党委对这一次学习作了如下的规定：学习的目的，在于使全体工作人员，对党在过渡时期的总路线和总任务有明确的了解。在学习中必须结合各机关的实际情况，对各种不正确的思想进行批判，从而提高全体工作人员的思想和工作水平。因此，原参加理论学习的高级组和中级组的同志，都应在学习“联共（布）党史”第九章的基础上，认真阅读指定的文件，并结合自己的思想和工作，进行讨论。对初级组的同志，各机关应组织有关总路线和总任务的报告，组织他们结合“经济建设常识读本”第一、二、三章进行学习。对参加文化学习的同志，则由各机关指定专人作若干次有关总路线和总任务的通俗讲课，并组织大家进行讨论。
    为了更好地进行学习，十一月二十八日中共中央直属机关党委召开了党员干部大会，由党委书记杨尚昆同志作了学习动员报告。杨尚昆同志在报告中阐明了党在过渡时期的总路线以及有关这方面的各个政策问题。他号召到会的党员干部，努力地认真地学习总路线，依照总路线的精神去进行工作，并随时随地向群众作宣传；在学习中结合文件检查和批判自己的思想和工作，为实现党在过渡时期的总路线而奋斗。
    目前，中共中央直属各机关都已根据党委的计划，作了具体的布置，并组织全体工作人员进行了总路线的学习。为了使同志们更好地领会党在过渡时期的总路线和总任务，中共中央直属机关党委于十二月五日举办了一次学习报告大会，请廖鲁言同志作了关于农业社会主义改造问题的报告。
