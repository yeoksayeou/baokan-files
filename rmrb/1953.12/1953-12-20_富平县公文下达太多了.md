Reader's Letters Abstract:

    Too Many Official Documents Issued in Fuping County
    Yu Bowen, Fuping County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Shaanxi Province, writes: The Fuping County Third District People's Government received a total of ninety-six official documents issued by county-level organizations in October, averaging more than three documents per day. On November 2nd alone, the district committee and the district people's government received thirty-six official documents issued by the county committee and the county people's government in October. A few of these documents were indeed urgent and needed to be issued, but many could have been resolved by being conveyed at certain meetings or by telephone; furthermore, some documents intended for other districts were mistakenly sent to the Third District People's Government. Most comrades in the district are working in the countryside, leaving only one secretary behind, how can they handle so many official documents?
    The main reason for the excessive issuance of official documents in Fuping County is that county-level units still exhibit decentralism and do not consider their work under the unified leadership of the Party committee. Furthermore, the leading bodies of the county committee and the county people's government have not taken effective measures to overcome this phenomenon. I suggest that the Party and government leading organs of Fuping County pay attention to the above situation and promptly take effective measures to correct decentralism and overcome the phenomenon of excessive issuance of official documents.

### 富平县公文下达太多了

专栏：读者来信摘要

    富平县公文下达太多了
    中共陕西省富平县委会喻博文来信：富平县三区人民政府在十月份共接到县级机关发下的公文九十六件，平均每天在三件以上。在十一月二日这一天，该区区委和区人民政府就接到县委、县人民政府十月份发来的公文三十六件。这些公文中有少数确是急需发的，但有不少可在一定的会议上或电话上传达即可解决；还有一部分发往别区的文件也错发到三区人民政府了。区里大部分同志都下乡工作，只留下秘书一人，怎能办得了这么多公文呢？
    富平县公文下达太多现象的主要原因是：县级各单位还存在着分散主义，没有在党委的统一领导下考虑自己的工作。而县委和县人民政府领导方面也没有采取有效办法来克服这种现象。我建议富平县党政领导机关重视以上情况，迅速采取有效办法来纠正分散主义，克服公文下达太多的现象。
