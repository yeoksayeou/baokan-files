Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 25th - According to TASS, the Soviet working people welcome with extreme satisfaction the verdict of the Special Tribunal of the Supreme Court of the USSR on Beria and his group of conspirators. Enterprises, institutions, and collective farms across the country held meetings on the 25th, unanimously supporting the verdict of the Supreme Court and guaranteeing to further enhance revolutionary vigilance. At the meeting of the "Hammer and Sickle" Steel Plant in Moscow, steelworker Ryabov said: The will of the people has eradicated the despicable traitor Beria and his accomplices from the motherland. This is the fate of anyone who wants to infringe upon our happy life! We, the working class, will unite our ranks even more closely around the Communist Party and the Soviet government, and will strengthen the economic power of the Soviet Union with greater energy. In Leningrad, Fedotova, a female worker at the Kirov factory, spoke angrily about the criminal activities of Beria and other traitors, saying: Irrefutable evidence has exposed the crimes of these scoundrels. The just verdict rendered by the Supreme Court of the USSR has been carried out. Traitors and betrayers are not allowed to exist on Soviet soil.

The working people of the Georgian Republic have expressed their indignation at the traitors like Beria and their warm support for the verdict of the Supreme Court. Mass meetings held in enterprises, institutions, collective farms, and machine tractor stations have shown this sentiment. At the "Twenty-Six Baku Commissars" machine-building factory in Tbilisi, fitter Okromchedlishvili said with satisfaction: The will of the people has triumphed. Beria, the enemy of our motherland, and his accomplices have been eliminated. They attempted to seize power, disintegrate the Soviet system of workers and peasants, and restore bourgeois rule in our country. However, the despicable plans of these spies and provocateurs have been completely defeated. No force can stop the Soviet people from building communism. At the general assembly of the Tibaanse Machine Tractor Station, female tractor driver Natroshvili said: The criminals attempted to incite hostility and discord among the various nationalities of our multi-ethnic country, undermining the friendship of the people of all nationalities in the Soviet Union. Now, this plan has failed. The strength of the Soviet system is unshakable, and the friendship of the people of all nationalities is unbreakable.

Many factories in the Ukrainian Republic also held mass rallies. Butuzov, a technician at the Kiev traffic signal machine factory, said: We have eliminated a group of conspiratorial villains who conspired to destroy our national strength. Let the enemies of the Soviet state remember that anyone who attempts to infringe upon the happy life of our people will still be resolutely liquidated in the future.

    苏联人民一致拥护对贝利亚叛国案的判决
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联劳动人民以极其满意的心情，欢迎苏联最高法院特别法庭对贝利亚及其拼凑的阴谋分子集团的判决。全国各地的企业、机关、集体农庄都在二十五日举行了集会，一致拥护最高法院的判决，并保证更加提高革命警惕性。在莫斯科“镰刀与锤子”钢铁工厂的大会上，炼钢工人里亚包夫说：人民的意志把祖国的卑鄙叛徒贝利亚及其同谋犯铲除掉了。任何一个想侵犯我们幸福生活的人的下场就是这样！我们工人阶级将更加紧密地把自己的队伍团结在共产党和苏联政府的周围，将以更大的精力来加强苏联的经济力量。在列宁格勒，基洛夫工厂女工费多托娃愤怒地谈到贝利亚等叛徒的罪恶活动，她说：不可辩驳的证据揭露了这些恶棍的罪行。苏联最高法院所作的公正判决已经执行了。在苏联的土地上是不容许叛徒和卖国贼存在的。
    格鲁吉亚共和国的劳动人民都表示了对贝利亚等叛徒的愤慨和对最高法院判决的热烈拥护。各企业、机关、集体农庄和机器拖拉机站举行的群众大会，都显示了这种情绪。在第比利斯的“二十六个巴库委员”机器制造工厂，钳工奥克罗姆切德利什维利满意地说：人民的意志取得了胜利。我们祖国的敌人贝利亚和他的帮凶被消灭了。他们企图攫取权力，瓦解工农苏维埃制度，并在我国恢复资产阶级统治。但是，这些间谍和挑衅者的卑鄙计划遭到了彻底的失败。没有任何力量能阻挡苏联人民建设共产主义。在季巴安斯克机器拖拉机站全体人员大会上，女拖拉机手纳特罗什维利说：罪犯们企图在我们多民族国家的各民族之间煽起敌视和纠纷，破坏苏联各民族人民的友谊。现在，这个计划破产了。苏维埃制度的力量是不可动摇的，各族人民的友谊是牢不可破的。
    乌克兰共和国的许多工厂也举行了群众集会。基辅交通信号机工厂的技师布图佐夫说：我们清除了一批阴谋的恶棍，他们阴谋摧毁我国的国力。让苏维埃国家的敌人记住吧，一切企图侵犯我们人民的幸福生活的人今后仍一定会遭到坚决的清算的。
