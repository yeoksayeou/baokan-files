Qingdao City's urban primary schools currently have 941 two-part system classes, with 46,083 students, accounting for 69% of the total number of primary school students in the urban area.

Qingdao's primary schools began implementing the two-part teaching system in the second half of 1949. At that time, 155 classes were established. By the second half of 1951, this had increased to 555 classes, all implementing a half-day system (one classroom, Class A attending in the morning, Class B attending in the afternoon). Later, it was discovered that some students came to school without eating breakfast (city residents generally eat breakfast later, while students in the morning session of the two-part system had to arrive before 8:00 AM). After four consecutive classes, they could not hold on for the last one or two classes. Students in the afternoon session, having played for half the morning, also became somewhat lax in their learning mood during the last class after four consecutive classes. At the same time, teachers in the half-day system were extremely tired after teaching four consecutive classes. Therefore, in order to take care of the health of both children and teachers, and to improve the teaching effectiveness, we decided to gradually change the half-day system to a "two-two system" of alternating morning and afternoon sessions, each with two classes, starting in the second half of 1951. This system was consolidated by the first half of 1952, and has now developed to the point where urban primary schools have solved the problem of enrolling an additional 23,000 children without increasing school buildings or reducing teaching effectiveness.

The "two-two system" we are talking about means that two classes of students use one classroom, each part attending two classes in the morning and afternoon. That is, in the morning, the first part attends the first and second classes, and the second part attends the third and fourth classes; the same applies in the afternoon. Since the schools changed from the half-day system to the "two-two system," the students' health has gradually improved. For example, after Shunxing Road Primary School changed from the half-day system to the "two-two system" in the second half of 1951, the number of students taking sick leave (mainly for stomachaches) decreased from 50% to 29%. Teaching effectiveness has also gradually improved. According to statistical materials, the teaching results of the "two-two system" are basically the same as those of the full-day system. For example, in the first half of 1951, 608 students in 12 classes from Shunxing Road Primary School, Sifang Primary School, and Jiangsu Road Primary School were in the full-day system, and the average final exam score was 76.8 points. In the second half of the year, after changing to the "two-two system," the average final exam score was 76.21 points. As another example, Yan'an Second Road Primary School changed both the fourth and fifth grades from full-day to "two-two system" in the second half of this year. Among them, the language and arithmetic teachers in one class each in the fourth and fifth grades followed the class. The scores of the first monthly exams in both semesters were roughly the same. The average score for language and arithmetic in the first monthly exam in the fourth grade in the first semester was 74.75 points, and the average score for the first monthly exam in this semester was 76.05 points. The average score for the first monthly exam in the fifth grade in the first semester was 76.15 points, and the score for the first monthly exam in this semester was 73.6 points.

Now the schools are accustomed to the teaching work of the "two-two system". Over the past two years, we have gained the following experiences in improving the teaching work of the primary school two-part system:

(1) The leadership must attach importance to it and do a good job of mobilization and publicity to eliminate teachers' fear of trouble and students' parents' concerns. When the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education instructed the schools to change the half-day two-part system to the "two-two system" in the second half of 1951, school administrators and teachers were afraid of trouble, believing that the total study time of the "two-two system" and the half-day system was not much different (both were four classes a day), only the form was different, and students had to go to school twice a day, which added extra trouble. Some teachers also believed that the half-day system allowed them to teach students for half a day, and they had half a day to grade students' homework; after changing to the "two-two system," students went to school for two classes in the morning and two classes in the afternoon, which fragmented their spare time. Some parents believed that students in the half-day system could help the family with some work for half a day at home, but changing to the "two-two system" fragmented the time. Some parents also believed that students who attended two classes in the morning and two classes in the afternoon would go home, running back and forth and forgetting what they had learned on the way. In response to the above situation, the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education convened a meeting of primary school principals and directors of teaching affairs, emphasizing that teaching work must start from the interests of children and should not be afraid of trouble. It pointed out that changing the half-day system to the "two-two system" was a better way to take care of children's sustained attention, age characteristics, and physical conditions by utilizing the convenience of concentrated urban population and students living close to school, and was for the purpose of improving teaching. The meeting also introduced the good results achieved by several schools in piloting the "two-two system" to dispel the school administrators' fear of trouble. After the meeting, the schools held separate teacher seminars and student parent seminars, and school administrators repeatedly conducted ideological mobilization and introduced the good results of piloting the "two-two system" to increase teachers' confidence. At the student parent seminars, it was explained that the implementation of the two-part teaching system was a revolutionary measure for running schools, and that changing from the half-day system to the "two-two system" was to take care of children's health and improve teaching effectiveness. The primary task of students was to do a good job in their studies, and we should try our best to create conditions for students to do a good job in their studies.

The spirit of "two-two system" students going to school for two hours each in the morning and afternoon is consistent with that of full-day students going to school in the morning and afternoon. After this series of publicity and education work, the ideological obstacles to implementing the "two-two system" were basically cleared, and the cooperation of parents was obtained. For example, when children were at home, parents supervised their studies at any time and urged them to go to school on time.

(2) We must strengthen teachers' sense of responsibility, make them pay attention to extracurricular tutoring, and go to students' homes according to plan and on time to check and guide them, so as to make up for the shortcomings of the two-part system students' insufficient study time at school. To this end, teachers must arrange appropriate extracurricular homework according to the actual situation of the children. The class teacher should grasp the overall situation of the homework assigned to the children by the teachers of each subject in the class. The amount of homework must be appropriate: too much will lengthen the children's self-study time, which will not only affect the children's health, but also affect the children's learning mood if the homework is not completed; too little homework, or no homework, will prevent the children from studying at home on time and easily develop bad habits such as loafing around. In order to ensure the timely completion of children's extracurricular homework, teachers should go to students' homes according to plan and on time to check and guide them. According to this requirement, the staffing of teachers in the two-part system should be at least the same as in the full-day system. It is absolutely not allowed to reduce the number of teachers due to the implementation of the two-part system, otherwise the teaching quality will be reduced.

(3) In order to facilitate teachers to tutor children outside of class, and to facilitate students to take care of each other, study at home on time, and go to school on time, "two-two system" students should preferably be grouped according to streets (especially in schools with a large number of classes), and home study groups should be established separately according to the distance of children's residential areas. Students attending the third and fourth classes should participate in home study groups for self-study for one hour before class every day, and students attending the first and second classes should participate in home study groups for self-study for one hour after class every day (only once every morning or afternoon). These home study groups are also travel groups to and from school. Fortunately, the ages of primary school students in cities are generally only one or two years apart, which is not enough to affect the progress of teaching due to grouping by street.

In order to enable parents to regularly supervise children to study and carry out activities at home in accordance with the school's regulations, the school should preferably hold small student parent seminars regularly according to streets and children's residential areas (this is a more convenient way for schools to contact parents), and if necessary, invite the cultural and educational committee members of the neighborhood residents' committees to participate, so as to widely solicit the opinions of student parents and the masses to jointly study and improve children's learning problems.

(4) Strengthen ideological and political education to cultivate children's consciousness of learning. This is especially important in "two-two system" teaching. Because "two-two system" students have more time for self-study outside of class, they must have conscious learning discipline to regularly carry out independent homework on time.

(5) The extracurricular activities of two-part system students are relatively restricted to a certain extent, so each school should diversify extracurricular activities according to the actual situation in order to solve this problem. If the school has spacious grounds, or has an auditorium and a large reading room, these facilities should be fully utilized; if the school has small grounds, the natural environment or public cultural places near the school should be utilized as much as possible. Currently, schools in Qingdao that run the "two-two system" have one or two extracurricular activities per week based on classes, and teachers use the time of these activities to conduct appropriate ideological and political education for children.

(6) Because children are not good at independently handling relatively complex learning lives, the time for "two-two system" students to go to school should not be changed frequently; otherwise, it will easily disrupt children's lives, make them unable to grasp the time to go to school, and will increase the phenomenon of being late or absent.

(7) There must be an appropriate interval when two parts of students change classes. In order to prevent the two parts of students from being chaotic during the daily class change time, there should be 15 to 20 minutes between the second and third classes in the morning as the exchange time for the two parts of students, and the same applies in the afternoon. In case of rain, the time for the second part to go to school is stipulated to be five to ten minutes later than usual, so that the second part of students can only go to school after the first part of students has left, so as not to have nowhere to avoid the rain.

(8) The "two-two system" is suitable for cities or towns with concentrated populations and children living close to school, but not suitable for rural areas with scattered residences and children living far from school. It is more appropriate for students living close to school to go to school for two classes each in the morning and afternoon and study at home for one class; in rural areas with scattered populations, some children live three, five, seven, or eight li away from home, and have to travel back and forth once every morning and afternoon, which is not as good as implementing a half-day system, so there are still 44 two-part system classes in Qingdao's suburban rural primary schools that are still half-day systems.

    青岛市各小学实行二部制的几点经验
    青岛市人民政府文教局
    青岛市市区各小学现有二部制共九百四十一班，学生四万六千零八十三人，占市区小学学生总人数百分之六十九。
    青岛市各小学是从一九四九年下半年开始实行二部制教学的。当时办了一百五十五班；到一九五一年下半年增加到五百五十五班，都是实行半日制（一个教室，半日甲班上课，半日乙班上课）。后来发现有些学生早晨不吃饭就到校（市民一般早饭较晚，而二部制上午班的学生必须八点以前到校），连续上四节课，到最后一两节课，就坚持不了；下午班的学生，上午玩了半天，下午连续上四节课，到最后一堂，学习情绪也有些松懈；同时，半日制班的教师连续上四节课，也极疲劳，所以，为了照顾儿童和教师的健康和提高教学效果，我们决定从一九五一年下半年起把半日制逐渐改为上下午各上两节的二部互换的“二二制”。这种制度到一九五二年上半年即已巩固起来，发展到现在，市区各小学在不增加校舍、不减低教学效果的情况下，额外解决了二万三千多个儿童的入学问题。
    我们所说的“二二制”，就是两班学生使用一个教室，每部上下午各上两节课，即上午第一部在第一、二节上课，第二部在第三、四节上课；下午也是这样。各校自从把半日制改成“二二制”以后，学生的健康状况逐渐好转。例如顺兴路小学在一九五一年下半年把半日制改成“二二制”以后，学生请病假（主要是肚子痛）的人数，已由百分之五十减至百分之二十九。在教学效果方面也逐步提高，从统计材料来看，“二二制”教学成绩和整日制基本一样。如顺兴路小学、四方小学、江苏路小学等三校十二班六百零八名学生，在一九五一年上半年是整日制，期终考试平均成绩是七十六点八分，下半年改为“二二制”，期终考试平均成绩是七十六点二一分。再如延安二路小学今年下半年四年级和五年级都由整日制改为“二二制”，其中四、五年级各有一班的语文、算术教师是跟班走，本学期和上学期两次第一次月考分数大体一样，四年级上学期第一次月考的语文、算术的平均成绩是七十四点七五分，本学期第一次月考平均成绩是七十六点零五分；五年级上学期第一次月考平均成绩是七十六点一五分，本学期第一次月考是七十三点六分。
    现在各校对于“二二制”的教学工作已经习惯了。两年来，我们在改进小学二部制的教学工作方面，获得了以下几点经验：
    （一）领导方面必须重视，并作好动员宣传工作，消除教师怕麻烦的思想和学生家长的顾虑。一九五一年下半年市文教局指示各校把半日二部制改成“二二制”的时候，学校行政干部和教师都存在着怕麻烦的思想，认为“二二制”和半日制的学习总时数没有什么区别（都是每日教学四节），只是形式不同，徒使学生每日到校两次，格外增加麻烦。也有些教师认为半日制给学生上课半天，还有半天时间可以给学生批改作业；改成“二二制”后，学生上午到校上课两节，下午又到校上课两节，这样就把课余的时间分散了。有的家长认为学生上下午都上两节课就回家，跑来跑去把学的功课都忘在路上了。也有的家长认为半日制的学生在家半日，还可以帮助家里干点活，改“二二制”后，把时间弄零碎了。市文教局根据以上情况，召开了一次小学校长、教导主任会议，强调说明教学工作必须从儿童的利益出发，不能怕麻烦；指出改半日制为“二二制”，是利用城市人口集中，学生离校较近的便利条件，照顾儿童的持续能力、年龄特征和身体条件的比较好的办法，是为了改进教学。会上并介绍了几个学校试行“二二制”得到优良效果的情况，以打通学校行政干部怕麻烦的思想。会后各校又分别召开教师座谈会及学生家长座谈会，由学校行政干部反复进行思想动员，并介绍试行“二二制”的优良效果，来提高教师的信心；在学生家长座谈会上，说明实行二部制教学是用革命办法办学的一种措施，由半日制改为“二二制”是为了照顾儿童的健康和提高教学效果，学生的首要任务是搞好学习，我们应尽量想办法为学生搞好学习创造条件。
    “二二制”学生每日上下午各到校学习两小时和整日制儿童每日上下午都到校学习的精神是一致的。经过这一系列的宣传教育工作，基本上扫清了实行“二二制”的思想障碍，并取得了家长的合作。例如，儿童在家时间，家长即随时督促其学习，并督促他们按时到校。
    （二）要加强教师的责任心，使他们注意课外辅导，有计划地按时到学生家里进行检查和指导，以补救二部制学生在校学习时间不足的缺点。为此，教师要按照儿童的实际情况，布置适当的课外作业。班主任要掌握各该班各科教师对儿童作业布置的全面情况。作业的分量必须适当：过多，会加长儿童的自习时间，不但影响儿童的健康，而且，作业做不完，也会影响儿童的学习情绪；作业太少，或没有作业，儿童就不能按时在家学习，容易养成闲荡等不良习惯。为了保证儿童课外作业的及时完成，教师要有计划地按时到学生家里进行检查和辅导。根据这一要求，二部制的教师配备，至少应如整日制一样，决不可因实行二部制而减少教师的编制，否则就要降低教学质量。
    （三）为了便利教师在课外对儿童进行辅导，又便于学生间相互照顾，按时在家学习，按时到校，“二二制”学生最好按街道编班（特别是班数多的学校），并按儿童住区的远近分别成立家庭学习小组。第三、四节上课的学生于每日上课之前，第一、二节上课的学生于每日下课之后参加家庭学习小组自习一小时（每日上午或下午只一次）。这种家庭学习小组，也是到校或离校的行路小组。好在城市小学生的年龄，一般相差不过一、二岁，还不至于因按街道编班而影响了教学的进行。
    为了使家长能够经常督促儿童在家庭按学校的规定进行学习和活动，学校最好定期地按街道和儿童的住区召开小型的学生家长座谈会（这是学校和家长联系的一种较便利的方式），必要时可请街道上的居民委员会的文教委员参加，借以广泛地征求学生家长和群众的意见，来共同研究改进儿童的学习问题。
    （四）加强思想政治教育，培养儿童学习的自觉性。这一点，在“二二制”教学中尤其重要。因为“二二制”学生课外自学的时间较多，必须有自觉的学习纪律才能经常地按时进行独立作业。
    （五）二部制学生的课外活动，相对地都要受到一定的限制，因此各校要根据实际情况，使课外活动多样化，以便解决这个问题。如果学校场地宽敞，或有礼堂和较大的阅览室，就要充分利用这些设备；如果学校场地狭小，就尽可能地利用学校附近的自然环境或公共文化场所。现在青岛办“二二制”的学校每周有一次或两次以班级为单位的课外活动，教师利用这些活动的时间，来对儿童进行适当的思想政治教育。
    （六）由于儿童还不善于独立处理比较复杂的学习生活，所以“二二制”学生到校时间不可时常变换；否则容易打乱儿童的生活秩序，使他们捉摸不定到校时间，就会增加迟到或缺课的现象。
    （七）两部学生换班时，须有适当的间隔。为了使两部学生在每日换班时间不紊乱，上午第二、三节中间应有十五分钟至二十分钟作为两部学生的交换时间，下午也是这样。如遇雨天，则规定第二部到校时间比平日迟到五分至十分钟，这样可以使第一部学生离校后，第二部学生才到校，不至于无处避雨。
    （八）“二二制”适合于人口集中、儿童离校较近的都市或城镇，不适合于居住分散、儿童离校较远的乡村。学生离校较近，两部学生上下午各到校学习两节，回家自学一节，这样比较合适；在人口分散的乡村，有的儿童离家三、五里或七、八里路，每天上下午都要往返一次，就不如实行半日制，所以青岛市郊区农村小学至今尚有四十四班二部制仍为半日制。
