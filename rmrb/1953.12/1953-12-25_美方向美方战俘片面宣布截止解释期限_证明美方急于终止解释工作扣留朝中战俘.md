    US Side Unilaterally Announced Deadline for Explanation to US POWs
    Proving US Side's Eagerness to End Explanation Work and Detain Korean and Chinese POWs
      [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 23rd] The US side today bluntly told their own prisoners of war: "The explanation period will end tonight." This attitude of complete disregard for the repatriation of prisoners of war was manifested in the broadcast the US side made this morning to twenty-two American prisoners of war, one British prisoner of war, and one hundred and three South Korean prisoners of war. This broadcast was delayed for nine days.
    In the three recorded messages broadcast by the US side to American, British, and South Korean prisoners of war, there was clearly no information provided on how to repatriate the prisoners of war, nor was there any guarantee on how to live peacefully after repatriation. When Major Moore of the "United Nations Command" broadcast to the American prisoners of war, he only focused on emphasizing that "the explanation period ends tonight."
    These short broadcasts lasted only one hour. After the American officers finished broadcasting the recorded messages, the prisoners of war demanded from behind the barbed wire: "Come and explain to us! We have been waiting for explanations for more than nine weeks." The American officers simply turned and walked away without looking back.
    After the broadcast began at eleven o'clock in the morning, the American and British prisoners of war immediately gathered behind the camp gate, which was hung with red flags and Picasso's dove of peace, and formed a circle to draft a protest against the broadcast and against being deprived of the right to hear explanations. This protest, which demanded individual explanations, was then passed to every prisoner of war, and all prisoners of war signed it. General Thimayya said: "The prisoners of war requested the Indian soldiers to send this document to the hospital so that their three sick prisoners of war could express their opinions and sign it if they agreed." Thirty yards away, South Korean prisoners of war gathered around another table to sign a similar protest. A Korean prisoner of war who spoke English acted as the prisoners' spokesperson, and he asked the officers of the Indian custodial forces to allow them to meet with the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to state their opinions and submit these two protests. The Indian officers promised to convey their request to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.
    American journalists and officers personally witnessed the bankruptcy of their own lies. They had said that "three or four" American prisoners of war were unable to return due to "fear, intimidation, and coercion." The absurdity of their broadcast, which stated, "It is clear that those so-called representatives are not informing you and are restricting the freedom of each of you to speak and act individually," was immediately exposed to the American officers in front of the Neutral Nations personnel. Dozens of Indian officers and Neutral Nations personnel were standing only ten meters away from the American, British, and South Korean prisoners of war. These prisoners of war could easily request repatriation and be taken out of the camp. They witnessed American and British prisoners of war dancing the Korean "harvest dance" with South Korean prisoners of war. To the clear beat of Korean drums and songs, two Korean prisoners of war dressed in colorful Korean women's clothing led the dancers around a low barbed wire fence several times. The only South Korean female prisoner of war was playing volleyball with other prisoners of war. American prisoners of war leisurely strolled with their South Korean friends. Other prisoners of war leaned against the walls of their wooden barracks, singing "The March of the World Federation of Democratic Youth" and "Solidarity Forever." All the American, British, and South Korean prisoners of war quickly gathered to listen to the Indian guard officers call their names. After hearing the order to "dismiss," these prisoners of war rushed to the ping-pong tables and volleyball courts. An Indian lieutenant colonel said: "I see more entertainment here than anything else."
    From the clumsy tricks played by the US side in Songgok-ri today, it is clear that although the loudspeakers of the US broadcast vehicles were facing the prisoner of war camp in Songgok-ri, their real target was not those US prisoners of war who had not yet heard explanations, but the public opinion that clearly saw the US side's failure in the "psychological warfare" in which it used prisoners of war as a gamble. The US side attempted to use the nonsense in this broadcast about the prisoners of war having no free will to cover up the truth that the US side was unwilling to provide explanations to their own prisoners of war, and attempted to use this perfunctory broadcast as an explanation to the relatives of the American prisoners of war and the American people. However, the fact that the US side is eager to end the explanation work, and even ignores the requests of their own prisoners of war to hear explanations, has fully exposed the US side's complete disregard for the rights and freedoms of their own prisoners of war. What they are wholeheartedly trying to accomplish is the heinous act of detaining more than 20,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war by force.

### 美方向美方战俘片面宣布截止解释期限  证明美方急于终止解释工作扣留朝中战俘

    美方向美方战俘片面宣布截止解释期限
    证明美方急于终止解释工作扣留朝中战俘
      【新华社开城二十三日电】美方今天直截了当地对他们自己的战俘说：“解释期限将于今夜截止。”这种对战俘的遣返毫不关心的态度，表现在美方今天上午向二十二名美国战俘、一名英国战俘和一百零三名南朝鲜战俘进行的广播里。这广播是延迟了九天才进行的。
    在美方对美国、英国和南朝鲜战俘所广播的三篇录音文告里，关于如何遣返战俘显然没有提供一点消息，关于遣返后如何过和平生活也显然没有提供一点保证。“联军司令部”的穆尔少校对美国战俘广播时，只注意强调“解释期限今夜截止”。
    这些简短的广播仅历一小时。当美国军官们把录音文告播送完毕以后，战俘们从铁丝网后面要求说：“来向我们解释吧！我们在过去九个多星期中一直在等待解释。”美国军官迳自头也不回地走开了。
    广播在上午十一点钟开始以后，美国和英国战俘立刻就在挂着红旗和毕加索的和平鸽的营场大门后面聚集起来，围成一个圈子，草拟一份反对广播、反对剥夺听取解释的权利的抗议书。这个要求进行个别解释的抗议书随后就传递给每一个战俘，所有战俘都在上面签了名。蒂迈雅将军说：“战俘们要求印度士兵将这个文件送到医院里去，让他们的三个患病的战俘去表示意见，如果他们同意，就签上名。”在距离三十码的地方，南朝鲜战俘聚集在另一张桌子的周围，在一份同样的抗议书上签名。有一名会说英语的朝鲜战俘充任战俘们的发言人，他要求印度看管部队的军官们让他们会见中立国遣返委员会，陈述他们的意见并送呈这两份抗议书。印度军官答应将他们的要求转达给中立国遣返委员会。
    美国新闻记者和军官们亲眼看到他们自己的谎言破产。他们曾说：“有三、四名”美国战俘由于
  “恐惧、威吓和高压手段”而无法回去。他们的广播中说：“事情很清楚，那些所谓代表不告知情况，并限制你们每个人单独发言和行动的自由”，这种话的荒谬性立刻在中立国人员面前被揭露给美国军官们看了。几十名印度军官和中立国人员站的地方只距离美国、英国和南朝鲜的战俘们十公尺。这些战俘可以轻而易举地要求遣返，并可被带出营场。他们目睹美国和英国战俘与南朝鲜战俘一起跳着朝鲜的“收割舞”。随着朝鲜鼓和歌曲的清晰节拍，两名穿着花花绿绿的朝鲜妇女服装的朝鲜战俘，领着跳舞的人绕着一道矮铁丝网跳了好几圈。唯一的一名南朝鲜女战俘在和其他战俘托排球。美国战俘闲逸地与他们的南朝鲜朋友在散步。其他战俘倚着他们木制营房的墙在唱“世界民主青年进行曲”和“永远团结”的歌曲。所有美国、英国和南朝鲜战俘很快地集合起来，听印度看守军官点名。在听到“解散”的口令后，这些战俘又争先恐后地奔向乒乓球桌和排球场去了。有一位印度中校说：“我在这里看到的娱乐比任何其他东西多。”
    从今天美方在松谷里玩的不高明的把戏，可以看得很清楚，美方广播车的喇叭虽然是对着松谷里战俘营场，但是它的真正对象并不是那些尚未听过解释的美方战俘，而是清楚地看到了美方在以战俘作为赌注的“心理战”中遭到了失败的公众舆论。美方企图用这个广播中关于战俘没有自由意志的胡说八道，来掩饰美方不愿对他们自己的战俘进行解释的真相，并且企图用这种敷衍了事的广播，作为对美国战俘的亲人和美国人民的交代。但是美方急于终止解释工作，甚至对他们自己的战俘提出的听取解释的要求也置之不理，这个事实就已经充分暴露了美方对于他们自己战俘的权利与自由毫不关心，他们一心一意要完成的，是以暴力来扣留两万多名朝中被俘人员的罪恶勾当。
