After our side had been explaining to the prisoners of war for a month and a half, the US side only began their explanation work on December 2nd, supposedly "to wait for a psychologically favorable moment" (Associated Press). By the 10th, the US explanation work had been going on smoothly for eight consecutive days in the explanation tent at Songgok-ri, but none of the 250 South Korean prisoners of war who had listened to the explanation were willing to return. – "I have personally experienced two worlds, and I am unwilling to return to South Korea ruled by Syngman Rhee." "Do you still want to trick me into returning to the pit of fire?" "I have already embarked on the road to happiness, and no one can stop me from taking this road!"… Listen! This is the answer of the non-directly repatriated South Korean prisoners of war to the explanation personnel of the Syngman Rhee group! This is the voice of the upright South Korean people striving for freedom!

People remember what happened not long ago in the explanation tent in Dongchang-ri. There, US special agents forced prisoners of war to shout, scold, bang on the table, and sprinkle bleach on the faces of the explanation personnel; US "observer representatives" and "reporters" openly threatened the prisoners of war; Swiss representatives also assisted from the sidelines...making it impossible for our side to have sufficient time to explain to the prisoners of war, causing the explanation work to be interrupted again and again, and completely halting our explanation work since November 17th. Despite this, many prisoners of war risked their lives and bravely walked into the door to apply for repatriation, or secretly climbed over the barbed wire to apply for repatriation and return to the embrace of their motherland.

But what about the explanation tent in Songgok-ri now? The situation is completely different, a stark contrast to Dongchang-ri. Here, there is no noise, no harassment, and the South Korean prisoners of war have ample time and complete freedom to listen to the explanation. The "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work" are strictly observed here. As the "Indian Times" repeatedly reported: The explanation work "began in a calm and orderly manner," and "the explanation work in the northern POW camp is proceeding under ideal conditions."

The explanation personnel of the Syngman Rhee group have exhausted all despicable and vile means in an attempt to "persuade" the prisoners of war to return to South Korea. They humbly addressed the prisoners of war as "warriors" and "Your Excellency"; they sweetly said that they would "retroactively pay salaries" to the prisoners of war, "promote" them on schedule, and commend "meritorious service"; they played sentimental music and had "emotional conversations" with the prisoners of war; they flaunted gold-cased watches, gold-covered fountain pens, and American lighters to the prisoners of war; they prepared to give the prisoners of war the best South Korean "Seagull" brand cigarettes to smoke… But what was the result? After patiently listening to the explanation, the prisoners of war walked into the door of non-application for repatriation one by one.

These prisoners of war were born and raised in South Korea. South Korea is their hometown, but why are they unwilling to return to South Korea?

Of course, this is not accidental. The reason why they are unwilling to return is because South Korea, as described by a reporter from the "Indian Times," is "a country where police rule everywhere," a "place of dying and death." They frankly told the explanation personnel of the Syngman Rhee group: "I love my hometown, but I cannot return when my hometown is ruled by you vampires, when it is ruled by the Americans." "I am not so foolish anymore, and I will no longer be cannon fodder for you." When the explanation personnel of the Syngman Rhee group shamelessly boasted about the "happy" life of the "free world" in South Korea, one prisoner of war immediately exposed this lie. He said: "'Freedom' is such a beautiful word! However, 'freedom' has only existed on you, and I have never had 'freedom'." This prisoner of war also angrily questioned: "When I was serving as a soldier in the Rhee army, American soldiers raped Korean women and forced me to stand guard outside. Is this your 'free world'?" "You are 'free,' why did the Americans force the people to elect Syngman Rhee as president? You are 'free,' why are the walls of the police stations so high, and why are machine guns mounted on top of the walls? You are 'free,' why can't children go to school and beg on the streets every day?" This is the accusation of the South Korean people against the dark and reactionary rule of the Syngman Rhee gang; this is the protest of the South Korean people against the atrocities of the American aggressors who have turned South Korea into a slaughterhouse and hell.

In order to avoid the prisoners of war's accusations against the reactionary rule of the US and Rhee bandits, the explanation personnel of the Syngman Rhee group sometimes shouted: "My explanation is over!" "Please change to another one!" while constantly playing noisy music to avoid answering the questions raised by the prisoners of war and to prevent the prisoners of war from having the opportunity to speak. Otherwise, when the prisoners of war expressed their unwillingness to return, they would console themselves by saying: "Your not returning will not cause any loss to the Republic of Korea." Look, the US explanation work has reached such an embarrassing and pathetic point!

The facts in the explanation tent in Songgok-ri prove that the US attempt to find a "favorable moment" to "persuade" the non-directly repatriated South Korean prisoners of war to return home has failed. Because that "moment" is not in the hands of the American aggressors and the Syngman Rhee gang, but in the hands of these awakened prisoners of war. These prisoners of war believe that the "moment" for them to return home will eventually come. Just as one of them said: "I will return to South Korea, when the American devils are driven out and our country is completely free, I will return."

    他们为什么不愿回去
    禾生
    在我方对战俘进行解释的一个半月以后，美方才在十二月二日开始他们的解释工作，据说是“要等待一个心理上有利的时刻”（合众社）。到十日为止，美方的解释工作已在松谷里解释帐篷里顺利地连续进行八天了，但是已经听取了解释的二百五十名南朝鲜战俘，却没有一个人愿意回去。——“我亲身经历过两个世界，我不愿意回到李承晚统治的南朝鲜去。”“难道你还想骗我回到火坑里去吗？”“我已经踏上了幸福的道路，我走这条道路是谁也不能阻拦的！”……请听！这就是未直接遣返的南朝鲜战俘对李承晚集团的解释人员的回答！这就是正直的南朝鲜人民争取自由的呼声！
    人们记得，不久前在东场里解释帐篷里发生了什么样的情况。在那里，美方特务强迫战俘叫嚣，辱骂，拍桌子，向解释人员脸上撒漂白粉；美方“观察代表”和“记者”公开对战俘进行威胁；瑞士代表也从旁协助……使我方没有充分的时间去对战俘进行解释，使解释工作一次次地被迫中断，而且使我方的解释工作自十一月十七日以来完全陷于停顿。尽管这样，还有许多战俘冒着生命的危险，勇敢地走入申请遣返的门，或者偷偷地爬过铁丝网，申请遣返，回到了祖国的怀抱。
    而目前在松谷里解释帐篷里呢？情况就完全不同了，这里与东场里比较，恰好是一个强烈的对照。在这里，没有吵嚷，没有骚扰，南朝鲜的战俘们有充分的时间、充分的自由听取解释。“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”和“解释和访问工作细则”在这里是被严格遵守着的。像“印度时报”一再报道的：解释工作是“在平静的、秩序井然的情况下开始”，“北战俘营的解释工作正在理想的情况下进行”。
    李承晚集团的解释人员用尽一切卑鄙恶劣的手段，企图“说服”战俘们回南朝鲜去。他们低声下气地尊称战俘为“勇士”，为“阁下”；他们甜言蜜语地说要给战俘们“补发薪金”，按期“升级”，表扬“功劳”；他们播放感伤的音乐，对战俘作“感情性的谈话”；他们向战俘炫耀金壳手表、金套钢笔和美国打火机；他们准备把南朝鲜最好的“白鸥牌”香烟送给战俘们吸……然而结果呢？战俘们在耐心地听取了解释以后，一个个地走入了不申请遣返的门。
    这些战俘们生在南朝鲜，长在南朝鲜，南朝鲜是他们的家乡，可是他们为什么不愿意回南朝鲜去呢？
    当然，这不是偶然的。他们所以不愿意回去，是因为南朝鲜正如“印度时报”记者所描写的，是“一个到处是警察统治的国家”，是
  一个“垂死和死亡的地方”。他们直率地告诉李承晚集团的解释人员：“我爱我的家乡，但在我的家乡被你们这些吸血鬼统治着的时候，被美国人统治着的时候，我不能回去。”“我已经不那样愚蠢了，不再给你们当炮灰了。”当李承晚集团的解释人员无耻地吹嘘南朝鲜“自由世界”的“幸福”生活时，一位战俘立刻就揭穿了这种谎话。他说：“‘自由’是一个多么美丽的词句！可是，‘自由’只在你们的身上有过，在我的身上却从来没有过‘自由’。”这位战俘并且愤怒地质问：“我在充当李伪军的时候，美国兵强奸朝鲜女同胞，强迫我在外面站岗，这就是你们的‘自由世界’吗？”“你们‘自由’，为什么美国人强迫人民选举李承晚当总统？你们‘自由’，为什么警察所的墙那末高，墙上面还架着机关枪？你们‘自由’，为什么儿童念不到书，每天在大街上讨饭吃？”这是南朝鲜人民对李承晚匪帮黑暗反动统治的控诉，这是南朝鲜人民对美国侵略者把南朝鲜变成屠场和地狱的暴行的抗议。
    李承晚集团的解释人员为了避免战俘们对美、李匪帮反动统治的指责，有时一面大嚷：“我的解释完了！”“请另换一个！”一面不断播放嘈杂的音乐，来逃避回答战俘们提出的问题，并使战俘们没有讲话的机会。要不然，就是当战俘们表示不愿回去时，聊以自慰地说一句：“你不回去，对大韩民国毫无损失。”请看，美方的解释工作已经弄到了这般狼狈和可怜的地步了！
  松谷里解释帐篷里的事实证明，美方要想找到一个“说服”未直接遣返的南朝鲜战俘回家的“有利的时刻”是失败了。因为那个“时刻”不是掌握在美国侵略者和李承晚匪帮手里，而是掌握在这些已经觉悟了的战俘们的手里。这些战俘们相信，他们回家的那个“时刻”终将到来。正像他们中间的一位所说的：“南朝鲜我是要回去的，当美国佬被赶出去，我们的国家完全获得自由时，我是要回去的。”（附图片）
