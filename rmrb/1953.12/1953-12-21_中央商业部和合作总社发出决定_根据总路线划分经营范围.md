Xinhua News Agency, December 20th – The Central Ministry of Commerce of the Central People's Government and the All-China Federation of Cooperatives recently issued a “Joint Decision on Delineating the Business Scope of State-Owned Commerce and Cooperatives for Industrial Products and Handicraft Products.” This decision was approved by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on December 2nd.

The decision stated: During the period of transition in our nation, the correct relationship between state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce should be as follows: State-owned commercial leading organs should strengthen business leadership over cooperatives, providing operational convenience and preferential treatment to facilitate the consolidation and development of cooperative commerce; cooperatives should respect the business leadership of state-owned commercial leading organs, acting as a strong assistant to state-owned commerce; and both should be closely integrated in policy and business, appropriately dividing the business scope between them, gradually expanding the total business volume of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce, thereby eliminating speculative private merchants, stabilizing the market, promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production, gradually guaranteeing the needs of the people, and consolidating the worker-peasant alliance. The leading organs of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce should, in accordance with the above spirit, and under the leadership of the Party and the government, change the phenomena of insufficient coordination between each other.

The decision pointed out: The division of labor in business between state-owned and cooperative commerce should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the general line and general tasks of the state during the transition period, appropriately dividing the operating scope of both parties. The basic requirements are:

In order for the state to uniformly grasp and balance the sales plans of state-owned enterprise products, to ensure that state-owned commerce has a secure source of goods, to expand the state-owned wholesale position in a planned manner, and to consolidate the leading position of state-owned commerce in the market, the processing, ordering, and wholesale of products from state-owned and local state-owned enterprises, which can be uniformly handled by state-owned commerce, shall all be uniformly handled by state-owned commerce.

For private enterprises, the measures of expanding processing, ordering, and purchase and sales in a planned and step-by-step manner through state-owned commerce should be used to promote the development of private industry towards the path of state capitalism, in order to facilitate the implementation of socialist transformation.

For handicrafts, supply and marketing cooperatives and consumer cooperatives should supply raw materials and promote the sale of products to promote their development in the direction of production cooperation.

The decision finally stated: In view of the fact that state-owned commerce is still unable to undertake the entire exclusive sales and ordering of all public and private enterprises in the short term, cooperatives should supplement the deficiencies of state-owned commerce for a certain period; at the same time, cooperatives cannot handle the sales of all handicraft products, and state-owned commerce needs to provide support. Therefore, the leading organs of state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce at all levels, under the leadership of the local Party and government, in addition to actively and prudently implementing the above principles, may also refer to the situation and principles in the decision to conduct specific consultations.

    中央商业部和合作总社发出决定
    根据总路线划分经营范围
    【新华社二十日讯】中央人民政府商业部与中华全国合作社联合总社最近发出“关于划分国营商业与合作社对工业品、手工业品经营范围的共同决定”。这个决定已于十二月二日经中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会批准。
    决定说：在国家的过渡时期，国营商业与合作社商业的正确关系应该是：国家商业的领导机关，加强对合作社的业务领导，予以经营上的便利和优待，以利合作社商业的巩固和发展；合作社则应尊重国家商业领导机关的业务领导，作为国营商业的有力助手；并在政策与业务上互相密切结合，适当地划分彼此间的经营范围，逐步扩大国营商业与合作社商业的营业总额，从而排除投机私商，稳定市场，促进工农业生产发展，逐步保证人民需要，巩固工农联盟。国营商业与合作社商业的领导机关，应依照上述精神，在党和政府的领导之下，改变相互间尚不够协调的现象。
    决定指出：国营与合作社商业之间的经营分工，应依照国家在过渡时期总路线、总任务的要求，进行适当分工，划分双方的经营范围。这些基本要求是：
    国家为了统一掌握和平衡国营企业产品的销售计划，为使国营商业确保货源，有计划地扩大国营批发阵地，巩固国营商业对市场的领导地位，国营与地方国营企业产品的加工、订货与批发，凡国营商业能统一办理者，一律由国营商业统一办理。
    对私营企业，应通过国营商业有计划、有步骤地扩大加工、订货和收购推销的措施，促进私营工业向国家资本主义的道路发展，以利实行社会主义的改造。
    对手工业，应由供销合作社和消费合作社供应原料、推销产品，促进其向生产合作化的方向发展。
    决定最后说：鉴于国营商业在短期内尚不可能对所有公、私企业进行全部的包销和订货，合作社应在一定时期内补充国营商业的不足；同时合作社亦不可能包办所有手工业品的推销，需要国营商业予以支持，因而各级国营商业与合作社商业的领导机关，在当地党和政府的领导下，除积极而又审慎的贯彻上述方针外，并可参照决定中的情况和原则，具体协商进行。
