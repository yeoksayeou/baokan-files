Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 21st (TASS): The Soviet Government issued the following statement regarding the speech by U.S. President Eisenhower on atomic weapons on December 8, 1953:

U.S. President Eisenhower delivered a speech on the issue of atomic weapons at the United Nations General Assembly on December 8. As previously reported, U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Mr. Charles Bohlen, visited Soviet Foreign Minister V.M. Molotov on December 7. The ambassador, acting on instructions from his government, requested the Soviet government to pay attention to the proposals contained in Eisenhower's speech. On December 9, Mr. Charles Bohlen submitted a summary of Eisenhower's speech to V.M. Molotov.

On December 21, Soviet Foreign Minister V.M. Molotov handed the full text of the Soviet government's statement on President Eisenhower's speech to Mr. Bohlen. The letter from U.S. Ambassador Charles Bohlen to V.M. Molotov and the summary of President Eisenhower's speech at the United Nations General Assembly submitted by Mr. Bohlen are published together.

The Soviet Government's statement is as follows: U.S. President Eisenhower's speech at the United Nations General Assembly on December 8 addressed the issue of the proliferation of atomic weapons. The U.S. President rightly emphasized that if governments do not take measures to stop the proliferation of atomic weapons, the current situation poses a danger to people around the world.

This danger is even more real today because, in addition to atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons have been developed in many ways, surpassing atomic weapons in destructive power. We must also not forget new types of weapons such as rocket weapons – modern technology makes it possible for them to fly thousands of kilometers without the aid of airplanes – and atomic torpedoes.

The discovery of the practical possibilities of utilizing atomic energy is the greatest achievement of modern science and technology. The possibilities of using atomic energy for war purposes and for peaceful purposes have both been discovered. Until recently, atomic energy has mainly been used for military production. However, humanity is concerned with ensuring that atomic energy is used only for peaceful needs and preventing it from being used for purposes that violate the honor and conscience of all nations, such as the mass slaughter of human beings and the barbaric destruction of cities.

Almost thirty years ago, the governments of forty-nine countries reached an agreement and signed the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which prohibits the use of chemical and bacteriological weapons and considers the use of such weapons of mass destruction a crime. This agreement between governments, which the Soviet Union has also signed, has yielded positive results.

Everyone knows that during the First World War, weapons of mass destruction such as asphyxiating and poisonous gases, as well as other types of chemical weapons, were widely used. The use of these weapons was severely condemned by people of all countries. At that time, there was already a danger of using vicious bacteriological weapons, the purpose of which was to infect peaceful residents of towns with the most terrible diseases, something that the conscience of the overwhelming majority of humanity could not tolerate. Therefore, there was a need to reach an international agreement in the form of the aforementioned Geneva Protocol, which condemns and prohibits the use of chemical and bacteriological weapons in war.

It is quite obvious that without this protocol, signed by forty-nine countries – although not yet ratified by all governments – there would have been no restraining factor on the use of chemical and bacteriological weapons during the Second World War. The fact that no government dared to use chemical and bacteriological weapons during the Second World War shows that the aforementioned agreement reached by governments to prohibit chemical and bacteriological weapons is of positive significance. Needless to say, we must not underestimate the fact that the governments within the anti-Hitler coalition, formed on the basis of international agreements, had firmly declared that if the enemy dared to use chemical weapons in the war, it would be met with severe retaliation.

The above considerations also fully apply to atomic and hydrogen weapons. As everyone knows, the United Nations does not classify these weapons as conventional armaments but as special weapons, considering them weapons of mass destruction.

It is understandable that President Eisenhower, known as one of the outstanding military leaders of the last world war, now emphasizes the destructive power of atomic weapons. At the same time, it must be remembered that this issue becomes increasingly significant as time passes.

It is absolutely incomprehensible if governments possessing atomic or hydrogen weapons do not give due importance to prohibiting atomic and hydrogen weapons, as well as all other weapons of mass destruction, or indefinitely postpone reaching an international agreement on this issue. There is no reason to take such an attitude towards such an important and urgent problem.

The Soviet Union has consistently fought for the prohibition of atomic weapons and for a substantial reduction of all other types of armaments. This is in line with the Soviet government's policy aimed at avoiding another war and strengthening international peace and cooperation.

In his December 8 speech on atomic weapons, the U.S. President pointed out that the issue of easing international tensions and creating an atmosphere of mutual peaceful trust is extremely important. This also coincides with the view of the Soviet government, which has been striving to promote the easing of international tensions and to strive for the consolidation of world peace.

In order to achieve success in these areas, joint efforts are needed to eliminate the causes that make it difficult to ease international tensions. As far as the Soviet Union is concerned, we are striving to concentrate the human and material resources of the Soviet people to complete the great new tasks of continuously developing our peaceful economy and culture, and we are striving to further expand international economic cooperation on the principle of equality and mutual benefit. The Soviet Union belongs to the category of countries that are striving to develop healthy international trade and are resolutely opposed to policies that have already been discredited in this area, policies of discrimination and policies of exerting pressure on countries that are not economically independent. The Soviet Union's foreign policy does not need to establish military blocs and alliances to oppose these or those countries, nor does it need to establish military bases on the territory of other countries. The Soviet Union believes that the policy of supporting subversive activities and sabotage in other countries or spending money to support secret agents and saboteurs is incompatible with normal international relations. If there is a desire to improve international relations, everyone will recognize these principles, which do not violate the national interests of any country and are fully in line with the interests of strengthening peace and international security.

It is for this reason that the Soviet Union attaches importance not only to the upcoming Berlin Conference, but also to the five-power conference with the participation of the People's Republic of China, because in the current situation, only the joint efforts of all major powers, coupled with the efforts of other countries, can guarantee the easing of overall international tensions and the corresponding resolution of pressing international issues. At the same time, this is in line with the United Nations Charter, which stipulates that the five major powers, the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and China, have a special responsibility for maintaining peace and international security. Moreover, it is quite obvious that only the People's Republic of China can currently represent the great Chinese people in the United Nations.

In order to enhance the role and prestige of the United Nations in strengthening world peace, efforts should be made especially and unremittingly to bring the positions of the five major powers closer together on the issue of ending the arms race, including atomic armaments, and all other armaments. Every step that can facilitate these countries in reaching an agreement on eliminating the threat of the use of atomic and hydrogen weapons and ending the general arms race will undoubtedly be warmly supported by all members of the United Nations. On this path, there are first of all important opportunities for easing international tensions and strengthening peace.

President Eisenhower described his views on the importance of atomic weapons, believing that several major relevant countries could hold corresponding secret or diplomatic talks.

Thus, President Eisenhower put forward a suggestion. He suggested that relevant governments should begin now, and continue thereafter, to donate "some of their stockpiled normal uranium and fissionable materials" to "an international atomic energy agency" under the auspices of the United Nations for peaceful purposes. The suggestion further pointed out that this international atomic energy agency could be charged with "responsibility for storing, safeguarding, and protecting the donated fissionable materials and other materials."

It is necessary to study what the intention of such a suggestion is.

First, the suggestion advocates using only "some" small part of the existing and newly established atomic materials stockpiles for peaceful purposes. This means that most of the atomic materials would be used as in the past to produce new atomic and hydrogen bombs, while there is still ample possibility to further stockpile atomic weapons and develop new types of atomic weapons with greater destructive power. Therefore, this suggestion in its current form does not impose any restrictions on countries that can produce atomic and hydrogen weapons.

Second, President Eisenhower's suggestion does not in the least limit the possibility of using atomic weapons. Adopting this suggestion would not restrain aggressors or prevent them from using atomic weapons at any time to achieve any purpose. Therefore, this suggestion does not in the least reduce the danger of atomic attacks.

Therefore, the inevitable conclusion is that the U.S. proposal in its current form cannot stop the ever-increasing production of atomic weapons, nor can it limit the possibility of using these weapons. We must take this into account when studying the real intention of this proposal.

If this suggestion was put forward because of a recognition of the necessity of prohibiting atomic weapons as weapons of aggression, then it would have a different meaning. However, the U.S. President's speech did not mention the necessity of prohibiting atomic weapons. Despite President Eisenhower's emphasis on the particular danger of atomic weapons to all the people of the world in the current atomic age, the speech did not say a word about the issue of prohibiting atomic weapons.

The question is this: is it possible to talk at length about the necessity of easing international tensions while not talking about the issue of prohibiting atomic weapons? There cannot be two different answers to this question. All those who are committed to easing international tensions and strengthening peace will inevitably demand that governments make efforts to achieve a positive solution to this issue as soon as possible.

As everyone knows, people of all countries are uneasy mainly because they fear the outbreak of an atomic war. If atomic weapons are not prohibited, it will not be possible to eliminate the threat of atomic war. The United Nations has recognized this since its inception and has formally stated that atomic weapons must be prohibited.

No one can deny the difficulties encountered in solving this problem. However, it cannot be said that the United Nations, especially the major relevant countries, has made sufficient efforts to strive for an international agreement on the prohibition of atomic weapons and the establishment of effective international supervision to supervise the implementation of the ban. Therefore, it is impossible to explain to the peace-loving people of all countries why the solution to this problem should be postponed further, or completely ignored, although the problem is very acute at present. Therefore, the Soviet government has until now always believed that the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and all other types of weapons of mass destruction, along with the establishment of strict international supervision to supervise the implementation of the ban, is the most important and most urgent issue, and that is the reason. All peace-loving people are concerned about the early resolution of this problem.

If the entire problem is narrowed down, making it merely about using a small portion of atomic materials for peaceful purposes while using the majority of the constantly increasing amount of atomic materials to manufacture atomic weapons with greater destructive power, then the threat of atomic war will not be reduced in the slightest. This may make the people of all countries less vigilant about the issue of atomic weapons, but it will not help reduce the real threat of atomic war.

If the agreement reached by governments only involves using a small portion of atomic materials for peaceful purposes without imposing any restrictions on the future production of atomic weapons, such an international agreement would in fact be directly permitting the production of atomic weapons. International permission for the production of atomic weapons would benefit the forces of aggression. This situation would not only not help reach an agreement on the prohibition of atomic weapons, but would instead become a new obstacle on the road to reaching such an agreement.

Because we are working to strengthen peace, our purpose is neither to relax vigilance against the danger of atomic war nor to allow atomic weapons production to be internationally permitted. It is precisely for this reason that it must be recognized that the task of peace-loving countries cannot be limited to merely using a small portion of atomic materials for peaceful purposes. It is most important that not just a portion of atomic materials, but all of it, should be used completely for peaceful purposes, so that there will be unprecedented possibilities for developing industry, agriculture, and transportation, for utilizing the very valuable inventions in the medical field, for improving the technology of various sectors utilizing atomic materials, and for enabling science to achieve even greater development.

At the same time, it can also be foreseen that prohibiting atomic and hydrogen weapons, using all atomic materials to meet the peaceful needs of the people of all countries, and appropriately taking into account the needs of economically backward regions, will be conducive to reaching an agreement on the definite reduction of conventional armaments. Conversely, this will greatly reduce the burden of taxes borne by the people of many countries due to their own large armies, air forces, and navies, that is, due to the constant arms race.

All of this requires people to recognize that it is necessary to prohibit atomic weapons, establish an international supervisory body to supervise the implementation of this ban, and unconditionally no longer use these weapons. Therefore, the Soviet government will continue to insist on reaching a corresponding international agreement on this issue as soon as possible.

As for President Eisenhower's remarks about conducting secret or diplomatic consultations on his proposal, the Soviet government, which persistently pursues a policy of peace, expresses its willingness to participate in such consultations. The Soviet government has always attached importance to direct consultations between countries in order to reach mutually acceptable agreements on contentious issues; doing so is conducive to consolidating world peace.

Since the U.S. proposal has some ambiguities in its main parts, neither stipulating that atomic weapons must be prohibited nor condemning the use of these weapons, the Soviet government hopes that the U.S. government will provide the necessary explanations, as indicated in its statement.

The Soviet Union is deeply convinced that humanity must and can avoid the horrors of atomic war. Countries that already possess the power of atomic weapons bear a particularly heavy responsibility for completing this task.

As for the Soviet Union, its position is very clear. Its position is to use the greatest discoveries of human wisdom not to destroy civilization but to comprehensively develop civilization, not to massively destroy humanity but to meet peaceful needs, and to ensure the improvement of the happiness of the people in all aspects.

The Soviet government is proceeding from the premise that the following Soviet proposals will be reviewed during the consultation process:

Out of a desire to ease international tensions, the countries participating in the agreement undertake a sacred and unconditional obligation not to use atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, or other weapons of mass destruction.

If an international agreement is reached on this issue, then a major start can be said to have been made on the two things: eliminating all atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other types of weapons of mass destruction from national armaments, and establishing strict international supervision to ensure that the agreement on prohibiting the use of atomic energy for war purposes is implemented.

The Soviet Union has always been very concerned about protecting humanity from the threat of deadly atomic and hydrogen weapons, and it will make every effort to ensure that these weapons never harm humanity.

    就美国总统关于原子武器的演说
    苏联政府发表声明
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十一日电：苏联政府就美国总统艾森豪威尔一九五三年十二月八日的演说发表声明如下：
    美国总统艾森豪威尔于十二月八日在联合国大会上就原子武器问题发表了演说。前已报道，美国驻苏联大使查·波伦先生于十二月七日拜访了苏联外交部部长维·米·莫洛托夫，大使奉他的政府的指示，要求苏联政府注意艾森豪威尔演说中包含的建议。十二月九日，查·波伦先生将艾森豪威尔演说的摘要递交维·米·莫洛托夫。
    十二月二十一日，苏联外交部部长维·米·莫洛托夫将苏联政府就艾森豪威尔总统的演说所作的下列声明全文交给波伦先生。美国驻苏大使查·波伦先生致维·米·莫洛托夫的信以及波伦先生递交的艾森豪威尔总统在联合国大会上演说的摘要一并公布。
    苏联政府声明如下：美国总统艾森豪威尔于十二月八日在联合国大会上的演说提到原子武器扩充问题。美国总统以充分的理由强调说，如果各国政府不采取措施制止原子武器的扩充，那么目前局势对世界各国人民是有危险的。
    由于今天除了原子武器以外，氢武器已经在许多方面得到了发展，在威力上超过了原子武器，这种危险也就更加真实了。我们也决不能忘记像火箭武器——现代的技术使得它有可能飞行几千公里而不必借助飞机，以及原子鱼雷等这样的新型武器。
    利用原子能的实际可能性的发现是近代科学与技术的最大成就。利用原子能于战争目的以及利用原子能于和平目的的可能性都被发现了。直到最近，主要还是在利用原子能来从事军备生产。不过人类关心的是：要使原子能只用于和平需要，并防止利用原子能来达到像大规模屠杀人类并野蛮地毁灭城市这样的违反各民族的荣誉与良心的目的。
    差不多三十年以前，四十九个国家的政府达成了协议，并签订了一九二五年日内瓦议定书，这个议定书规定禁止使用化学与细菌武器，并认为使用这种大规模杀人武器是一种罪行。苏联过去也在上面签了字的这个各国政府之间的协议已经产生了积极的结果。
    大家都知道在第一次世界大战时期中，曾广泛使用像窒息性瓦斯与毒瓦斯这样的大规模杀人武器，以及其它类型的化学武器，这种武器的使用遭到了各国人民的严厉谴责。在那个时候，就已经有了使用恶毒的细菌武器的危险，使用这种武器的目的是要以最可怕的疾病来感染城镇的和平居民，这是压倒多数的人类的良心所不能容忍的。因此，才有了达成上述日内瓦议定书形式的国际协议的必要，这个议定书谴责并禁止在战争中使用化学与细菌武器。
    十分明显：如果没有四十九个国家签字——虽然还不是所有政府都已批准——的这个议定书，那么在第二次世界大战中，也就没有对使用化学与细菌武器的任何约束的因素了。在第二次世界大战中，没有一个政府胆敢使用化学与细菌武器，这个事实说明各个政府达成的禁止化学与细菌武器的上述协议是有积极的意义的。不待说，大家也不能轻视这个事实，就是在国际协议的基础上形成的反希特勒联盟中的各国政府曾经坚决地宣布：假如敌人胆敢在战争中使用化学武器，那末它将遭到严重的打击。
    上述考虑也完全适用于原子武器与氢武器。大家知道联合国并不把这些武器列在常规军备项内，而把它们当作特种武器，认为它们是大规模毁灭性的武器。
    以上次世界大战中的杰出军事领袖之一著称的艾森豪威尔总统现在要强调原子武器的毁灭力量，这是可以了解的。同时也必须记住，随着时间的消逝，这个问题也越来越具有重大意义了。
    假如掌握原子武器或氢武器的政府不来适当地重视禁止原子武器与氢武器，以及所有其他大规模毁灭性的武器，或是把就这个问题达成国际协议这件事无限期地推迟到将来，这是绝对不能理解的。对于这样一个重要而迫切的问题采取这样的态度是没有任何理由的。
    苏联一贯为禁止原子武器以及大量裁减各种其他类型的军备而斗争。这是符合于苏联政府旨在避免另一次战争和加强国际和平与合作的政策的。
    美国总统在十二月八日关于原子武器的演说中指出，缓和国际紧张局势和造成彼此和平信任的气氛的问题是十分重要的。这也符合于苏联政府的看法，苏联政府一直在努力促进国际紧张局势的缓和，并争取世界和平的巩固。
    为了在这些方面获得成就，需要大家共同努力来消除国际紧张局势难以缓和的原因。就苏联来说，我们正尽力集中苏联人民的人力和物力来完成不断发展我国和平经济与文化的伟大的新任务，我们正尽力在平等互利的原则下进一步扩大国际经济合作。苏联是属于这样一类国家之列的，这些国家在努力发展健全的国际贸易，并坚决反对在这方面已经声誉扫地的政策，反对歧视和对经济上没有独立的国家施用压力的政策。苏联的外交政策不需要建立军事集团和联盟来反对这些或那些国家，也不需要在他国领土上建立军事基地。苏联认为，在其他国家支持破坏和颠覆活动或者出钱豢养秘密特务和破坏者的政策，是与正常的国际关系不相容的。如果有了改善国际关系的愿望，大家就会承认这些不会违反任何一国的民族利益同时又完全符合于加强和平与国际安全的利益的原则。
    就是为了这个原因，苏联才不仅重视即将举行的柏林会议，而且重视有中华人民共和国参加的五国会议，因为在目前形势下，只有所有大国共同努力，再加上其他国家的努力，才能保证缓和整个国际紧张局势和相应解决一个个迫切的国际问题。同时，这也符合于联合国宪章，宪章规定，美、英、法、苏、中五大国对维护和平与国际安全负有特别责任。而且十分明显的，目前只有中华人民共和国才能在联合国中代表伟大的中国人民。
    为了要增进联合国在加强世界和平方面的作用和威信，应该特别不屈不挠地促使五大国在结束原子军备和其他一切军备竞赛问题上的立场更趋接近。每一个步骤，只要可以促使这些国家在消除使用原子武器和氢武器的威胁和结束一般军备竞赛问题上达成协议，无疑会受到所有联合国会员国的热诚拥护。在这条道路上，首先就有着缓和国际紧张局势和加强和平的重要机会。
    艾森豪威尔总统叙述了他对原子武器的重要性的看法，他认为几个主要有关国家可以举行相应的秘密的或外交上的会谈。
    于是，艾森豪威尔总统提出了一个建议。他建议有关各国政府现在就开始，以后并继续捐献出
  “一些它们储存的常态铀和可分裂物质”给联合国所主持的“一个国际原子能机构”以用于和平目的。这个建议更指出，可以责成这个国际原子能机构“负责贮藏、保管、保护所捐献的可分裂物质及其他物资。”
    有必要来研究一下，这样的一个建议的用意何在。
    第一、这个建议主张在原有的和新建立的原子物资贮备中，只用“一些”小部分于和平的目的。这就是说大部分原子物资就要像过去一样用来生产新的原子弹和氢弹，同时仍然有着充分的可能性来进一步贮备原子武器和发展毁灭力更大的新型原子武器。因此，目前形式的这个建议对于能够生产原子武器和氢武器的国家没有任何约束力。
    第二、艾森豪威尔总统的建议丝毫没有限制使用原子武器的可能性。采纳这个建议并不能限制侵略者、不能限制他们在任何时候使用原子武器来达到任何目的。因此，这个建议丝毫没有减少原子袭击的危险。
    所以，得出的结论必然是：美国提出的目前这种形式的建议既不能制止原子武器的日益扩大的生产，也不能限制使用这些武器的可能性。在研究这个建议的真正用意时，我们不得不考虑到这一点。
    如果是由于认识到禁止作为侵略武器的原子武器的必要性才提出这个建议的话，那么它就会有另外一种意义了。但是，美国总统的演说并没有提起禁止原子武器的必要性。尽管艾森豪威尔总统强调指出了在目前原子时代原子武器对全世界人民的特别的危险性，但是这篇演说对于禁止原子武器的问题却只字未提。
    问题就在这里：是否可能一面大谈其缓和国际紧张局势的必要性，同时却不谈禁止原子武器的问题呢？对于这个问题不可能有两种不同的答复。凡是致力于缓和国际紧张局势和加强和平的人们，势必会要求各国政府尽力使这个问题早日得到积极的解决。
    大家都知道，各国人民之所以感到不安主要是由于他们担心会爆发原子战争。如果不禁止原子武器，就不可能消除原子战争的威胁。联合国从成立之日起就认识到这一点，并正式表示必须禁止原子武器。
    没有人能否认在解决这个问题时所遇到的困难。不过还不能说联合国，首先是主要有关国家已尽了足够的努力来争取在禁止原子武器和建立有效的国际监督以监督禁令的实施的问题上达成国际协议。因此，这样就不可能向各国爱好和平人民解释有什么理由使得这个问题的解决还要推迟，或者完全不理会这个问题，虽然目前这个问题是十分尖锐的。因此，苏联政府到现在为止一直认为，无条件禁止原子武器、氢武器和其它各种大规模毁灭性的武器同时建立严格的国际监督以监督禁令的实施，是最重要而且是最迫切的问题，也就是这个原因。一切爱好和平的人民都很关心这个问题的尽早解决。
    如果缩小整个问题，使它仅仅成为：将一小部分原子物资用于和平目的而将大部分数量不断增加的原子物资用来制造毁灭力更大的原子武器，那末原子战争的威胁丝毫也不会因此减少。这可能使各国人民对于原子武器的问题放松警惕，但不能有助于减少原子战争的真正威胁。
    如果各国政府达成的协议只是将一小部分原子物资用于和平目的而对今后原子武器的生产丝毫不加限制的话，这种国际协议实际上就是直接准许生产原子武器。国际准许原子武器的生产会使侵略势力得到便宜。这种情况不仅不能有助于在禁止原子武器问题上达成协议，相反地会成为达成这种协议的道路上的一个新的阻碍。
    由于我们在为加强和平而努力，我们的目的就既不是放松对原子战争的危险的警惕，也不是使原子武器生产得到国际准许。正因为如此，必须认识到，各爱好和平国家的任务不能局限于仅把原子物资的一小部分用于和平目的。不应仅把原子物资的一部分而应把全部完全用在和平目的上，这是最主要的，这样就能有空前的可能来发展工业、农业和运输业，来利用医药界非常有价值的发明，改进利用原子物资各部门的技术，使科学能进一步获得更大的发展。
    同时还可以预计得到，禁用原子武器和氢武器、利用一切原子物资来满足各国人民的和平需要、适当地照顾经济落后地区的要求，就能有利于就确定地裁减常规军备的问题达成协议。反过来，这将大大减轻许多国家的人民因其本国拥有庞大的陆军、空军和海军、即因不断的扩军竞赛而担负的赋税重担。
    这一切要求人们认识到必须禁用原子武器、建立国际监督机构来监督这个禁令的实施，和无条件地不再使用这些武器。因此，苏联政府将继续坚持在这个问题上迅速达成一个相应的国际协定。
    至于艾森豪威尔总统说到就他的建议进行秘密的或外交的商谈这一点，坚持不渝地奉行和平政策的苏联政府表示愿意参加这种商谈。苏联政府一向重视各国直接进行商谈，以便在争执问题上取得双方都能接受的协议；这样做，是有助于世界和平的巩固的。
    由于美国的建议在它主要的部分有些不明确的地方，既没有规定必须禁用原子武器，也没有规定谴责使用这些武器，苏联政府希望美国政府作出必要的解释，正如它的声明所表示的那样。
    苏联深信人类必须而且可以避免原子战争的恐怖。已经拥有原子武器威力的国家对于完成这个任务担负着特别重大的责任。
    至于苏联，它的立场是非常明确的。它的立场就是使人类智慧的最伟大的发现不用来破坏文明而用来使文明得到全面的发展，不用来大规模毁灭人类而用来满足和平的需要，用来保证各方面地提高人民的幸福。
    苏联政府是从这样一个前提出发的，即在商谈过程中将同时审查苏联的下列建议：
    参与协议的各国，出于缓和国际紧张局势的愿望，承担起神圣的、无条件的义务，不再使用原子武器、氢武器以及其他大规模毁灭性武器。
    在这个问题上如取得国际协议，那么从国家军备中取消全部原子武器、氢武器和其他类型大规模毁灭性武器、以及为保证关于禁用原子能来从事战争的协定得以实施而建立严格的国际监督这两件事，就都可说有了一个重大的开端。
    苏联一向非常关心使人类不受致命的原子武器和氢武器威胁，它将尽一切努力来使这些武器永远不能危害人类。
