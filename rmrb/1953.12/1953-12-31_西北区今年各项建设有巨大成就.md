Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, December 30th: In the vast, resource-rich Northwest region, new oil, coal, and non-ferrous metal deposits have been discovered this year. Newly built railways have increased by 190 kilometers, and newly built and restored highways have increased by more than 2,000 kilometers. This has created favorable conditions for large-scale industrial development in the Northwest in the future.

    For several years, the Northwest region has systematically conducted geological surveys. Based on this, the scale of resource exploration in the Northwest region in 1953 was even larger. The footage drilled this year is equal to 4.86 times that of 1952. The new oil structures, coal fields, and non-ferrous metal mineral resources found in the Northwest region in 1953 provide important data for the future development of the fuel industry and metallurgical industry. After drilling in 1953, the reserves of some underground resources have been determined and are necessary for plant design.

    Railway construction is the first step in developing industry in the Northwest. This year, the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, a difficult project, has been laid from Lanzhou to Wushaoling, a total length of 190 kilometers. Due to the extension of the railway line, oil from the famous Yumen Oilfield has begun to be transported eastward in a steady stream. The Baoji-Tianshui section of the Longhai Railway continued to be thoroughly repaired this year, and the newly built Tianshui-Lanzhou section has also been greatly improved. These measures have ensured the transportation of tens of millions of tons of materials needed for construction in the area west of Lanzhou this year. The construction of new railways is also constantly developing. The survey of the Lanzhou-Yinchuan Railway has begun this year, and the fixed survey of the northern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway has been completed and will be constructed next year. This year, the entire region has newly built, renovated, and restored 2,200 kilometers of highways. In particular, the accelerated construction of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway and the Lanzhou-Langmusi Highway will play a significant role in developing the economy and culture of ethnic minority areas in the Northwest.

    In order to prepare power conditions for industrial development, the Northwest region's electric power industry has also made great achievements this year. The newly built Xi'an and Ürümqi thermal power plants have begun to supply electricity one after another, and some small and medium-sized cities have also built small power plants this year. As a result, the generating capacity of public power plants in the entire region has increased by more than 1.3 times compared to last year.

    In 1953, the collection of basic design data for certain large-scale new factories and mines planned for construction had begun. In Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, the sites of some new factories and mines have been initially determined, and design can begin in 1954.

    While constructing heavy industry, the Northwest region also correspondingly developed local industries urgently needed for people's livelihoods and national construction in 1953, especially light industry. Of the three newly built textile factories this year, two have been put into production, and three other textile factories have completed expansion projects. At present, the number of spindles in the entire region has increased by 51% compared to 1952, and the number of looms has increased by 123%. Some cities have also built large-scale flour mills, increasing the flour industry's production capacity in the entire region by 37% compared to 1952. In order to supply construction needs, various places also built some small hardware, brick, tile, lime, paint, and wood processing factories in 1953.

    In order to ensure the smooth progress of construction work, in 1953, the Party and government departments in the Northwest region transferred a large number of cadres to the industrial construction front, which led to a rapid increase in the strength of capital construction. For example, the number of geological exploration personnel has increased by more than four times compared to last year, the number of employees in the power engineering company has expanded four times, and the number of employees in the textile engineering company has expanded six times. In 1953, the construction in the Northwest region also received enthusiastic help from Soviet experts, and learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. For example, the newly built power plant in Xi'an was successfully built in only eleven months with the help of Soviet experts, and the quality met the standards. After learning from the advanced Soviet geological work experience, the geological exploration personnel for oil, coal, and metal mineral resources have also successfully completed this year's exploration tasks.

    西北区今年各项建设有巨大成就
    【新华社西安三十日电】在广漠的矿藏富饶的西北地区，今年资源勘探又找到了新的石油、煤田和有色金属的矿藏，新筑的铁路又增长了一百九十公里，新建和恢复的公路又增加了二千多公里，这就为今后大规模发展西北工业创造了有利的条件。
    西北地区几年来曾有计划地进行了地质调查工作。在这个基础上，一九五三年西北区的资源勘探工作规模更大了，今年已钻探的进尺就等于一九五二年的四点八六倍。一九五三年在西北地区找到的新的石油构造、煤田和有色金属矿产，为今后发展燃料工业和冶金工业提供了重要的资料。有的地下资源经过一九五三年的钻探以后，并已确定了为建厂设计所必需的储量。
    铁路建设是发展西北工业的先行步骤。今年工程艰巨的兰新铁路已从兰州铺轨到乌鞘岭，共长一百九十公里。由于铁路线的延伸，著名玉门油矿的石油已开始源源东运。陇海铁路宝鸡—天水段今年继续进行了彻底整修，新建天水—兰州段也有很大改善。这些措施保证了兰州以西地区今年建设所需成千万吨器材的运输。新铁路的建设工作也在不断地发展，兰州到银川的铁路今年已开始勘测，宝成铁路北段定测工作已经完成，明年就要施工了。全区今年又新建、改建和恢复了二千二百公里长的公路，特别是青藏公路和兰郎公路的加紧修建，对于发展西北少数民族地区的经济和文化，将起重大的作用。
    为发展工业准备动力条件，今年西北区的电力工业建设也有很大成绩。新建西安和迪化的火力发电厂已先后开始供电了，一些中小城市今年也建设了小型发电厂。全区公用电厂的发电容量因而比去年增加了一点三倍以上。
    计划建设的某些规模宏大的新厂矿，一九五三年已着手搜集设计基础资料。在陕西、甘肃两省，有些新厂矿的厂址已经初步勘定，一九五四年就可以开始设计了。
    与建设重工业的同时，西北地区一九五三年还相应地发展了人民生活和国家建设所急需的地方工业，特别是轻工业。今年新建的三个纺织厂有两个已投入生产，另有三个纺织厂完成了扩建工程。目前全区的纱锭数已比一九五二年增加百分之五十一，布机数增加百分之一百二十三。有的城市还建设了大型面粉厂，使全区面粉工业生产能力比一九五二年增长百分之三十七。为供应建设需要，各地一九五三年并增建了一些小五金、砖瓦、石灰、油漆、木材加工等工厂。
    为了保证建设工作的顺利进行，一九五三年西北地区的党政部门曾抽调大批干部到工业建设战线上来，使基本建设力量飞跃增长。如地质勘探人员比去年增加了四倍多，电业工程公司人员扩大了四倍，纺织工程公司人员扩大了六倍。一九五三年西北地区的建设并得到了苏联专家的热诚帮助，学习了苏联的先进经验。如西安新建的发电厂在苏联专家帮助下，只十一个月就建设成功，质量合乎标准。石油、煤炭和金属矿产的地质勘探人员，学习苏联先进的地质工作经验后，也都胜利完成了今年的勘探任务。
