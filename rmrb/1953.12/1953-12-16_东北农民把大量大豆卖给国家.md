Northeast farmers, having achieved a bumper soybean harvest, are selling large quantities of soybeans to the state. The state's soybean procurement plan for both October and November has been overfulfilled. As of December 6th, the region's soybean procurement reached 86.7% of the fourth quarter procurement plan. This year, soybeans in most parts of Northeast China are not only abundant but also of good quality. Soybeans harvested in some southern areas have an oil yield exceeding that of last year.

    东北农民把大量大豆卖给国家
    获得大豆丰收的东北农民正大量把大豆卖给国家。十、十一两月国家的大豆收购计划都已超额完成，至十二月六日止，全区收购的大豆占第四季度收购计划的百分之八十六点七。今年东北多数地区的大豆不但丰收，而且质量较好，南部的一些地区收获的大豆，出油率超过去年。（新华社）
