    The Chairman of the German Peace Committee, Professor Walter Friedrich, delivered a speech to the congress.

Professor Friedrich called on the German people to redouble their efforts to resolve outstanding international issues, mainly to strive for a peaceful solution to the German question and to oppose the implementation of the Bonn and Paris military treaties. In order to achieve the above goals, it is necessary to resolutely support the efforts of the government of the German Democratic Republic to reach an all-German agreement to peacefully restore German unity.
