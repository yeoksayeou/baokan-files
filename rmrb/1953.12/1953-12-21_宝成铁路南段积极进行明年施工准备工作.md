Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, December 19th: The preparatory work for the 1954 construction of the southern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is actively underway. A new construction progress plan, larger in scale than this year's, has been compiled. In some areas where construction has already started, the construction plan for January next year has been delivered to the construction site.

　　The construction work on the southern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway next year will all enter mountainous areas, requiring track laying to continue from Mianyang to Guangyuan, which is 345 kilometers from Chengdu; the project from Guangyuan to Lueyang to the north is also required to be 40 percent completed next year. Because the number of tunnels and bridges will increase, all the projects next year will be more difficult than this year. The workload of just the Guangyuan to Lueyang section is more than twice the entire project from Chengdu to Mianyang. The degree of mechanized construction will be increased in many key projects next year. In tunnel projects, mechanized tools will increase fivefold; in stone excavation for roadbed construction, machinery will partially replace manpower; excavation, earthmoving, slag removal, and loading and unloading operations will also be partially mechanized and automated. At present, a number of bulldozers, rock drills and dump trucks with automatic loading and unloading devices have been transported to the construction site, and more rock drilling and road construction machinery is being intensively repaired, ready for deployment.

　　In order to ensure the supply of materials after the project moves north, the survey and construction of new water and land transportation routes are being stepped up, and transportation capacity is being actively increased. The transportation route from Mianxian, Shaanxi, to Lueyang has already started construction. The transportation route along the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway from Liejinba to Yangpingguan has been completed. New navigation channels on the Jialing River are being dredged. Other transportation routes, such as the flatbed cart paths and small rail paths from Guanyinba in Guangyuan to Lueyang, are also being surveyed. A large number of ships transferred from the Jialing River, the Fu River, and the Qu River have partially entered the construction area. Various types of human-powered vehicles suitable for transportation on mountainous roads are also being concentrated in large numbers to the new construction site. A batch of trucks will also be added next year.

　　Currently, advance teams have already built sheds on the new construction sites, and tens of thousands of workers who were originally working in the plains have been transferred to the new construction sites in batches. The more massive 1954 construction project of the southern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway is about to unfold in the deep mountainous areas from Zhongba to Lueyang, which are more than 300 kilometers long.

### 宝成铁路南段积极进行明年施工准备工作

    宝成铁路南段积极进行明年施工准备工作
   【新华社成都十九日电】宝成铁路南段一九五四年度的施工准备工作正在积极进行。一个新的比今年规模更大的工程进度计划已经编制出来。部分已经开工的地区，明年一月份的施工计划已下达到工地。
    明年度宝成铁路南段的施工工程将全部进入山区，要求从绵阳继续铺轨到距离成都三百四十五公里的广元；广元以北到略阳的工程也要求在明年完成百分之四十。因为隧道和桥涵增多，明年全部工程将比今年更加艰巨，仅广元到略阳一段的工程量就比成都到绵阳段的全部工程量大两倍还多。明年度许多重点工程都将增强机械化施工程度。在隧道工程中，机械化工具将增加五倍；在修筑路基的石方工程中，也将部分用机械代替人力；挖泥、掘土、采渣和装卸工作，也将部分地机械化和自动化。目前，一部分各种型式的推土机、开山机和带有自动装卸装置的倾卸车等已运抵工地，更多的开山筑路机械正在紧张地检修，准备调用。
    为了保证工程北移后材料的供应，新的水陆便道的测定和施工工作正在加紧进行，运输力量正在积极增强。从陕西沔县到略阳的便道已经开工。川陕公路从烈金坝到阳平关的便道已经修通。新的嘉陵江航运河道已在进行淘滩工作。其余从广元观音坝到略阳中途的板车便道和小钢轨便道等，也都在测定中。从嘉陵江、涪江和渠江上调用的大批船只，部分已进入工区。适应山区便道运输的各种人力车辆也大批地向新的工地集中。明年还将增加一批卡车。
    现在，新工地上先遣的队伍已经搭起工棚，原来在平原地区施工的成万工人已经成批地转到新的工地。宝成铁路南段一九五四年度更加巨大的施工工程，即将在从中坝到略阳的长达三百多公里的深山地区展开。
