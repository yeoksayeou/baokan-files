How to Place "I"
    Ma Qianzu

    To study the general line, the first thing is to correct how we place "I."

    We often say that individual interests must be subordinate to the interests of the collective, society, and the people. But this may not always be the case in specific work processes.

    Within a unit, comrades sometimes like to compare ranks and treatments. "My" ability is no weaker than yours, yet you are a grade higher than me; "I" am not convinced. Among those of the same rank, those with strong abilities often feel wronged. "Humph, he can be ranked at the same level as me, while 'I' am...?" Then, naturally, another "Humph!"

    Some leading cadres, when talking about work, always say "my unit" is doing this and that, or "my unit" has never made mistakes. They don't like to say "we," and above the "unit," there is only an "I." They rarely think that the show is difficult to perform alone. The achievements of a unit's work do not depend entirely on the leadership, but should be attributed more to the collective's joint efforts. A comrade's mistake may not be without one's own share, not to mention the leaders. It is good to never make mistakes in work, but it is important to examine what the achievements are, which is the spirit of "looking forward." Those who value "I" too much tend to be conservative in their work, "only seeking to avoid mistakes"; or, without starting from the actual work combined with policies, they specialize in figuring out the leader's personal intentions to please the leader.

    There are also such people who, when reporting their work, always say "I, I," "I" did this and that work; "I" gave a speech that aroused the welcome of the broad masses; "I" had already said that doing it this way would not work; good, now the higher authorities have come to criticize, this has nothing to do with "I." Such people place "I" above or outside the collective; the "hero" is "heroic" enough, perhaps a Zhuge Liang, but it is individual heroism. Or a hindsight Zhuge Liang; still harmful to the collective.

    We should remember "we" or "us" more often. Measure this "I" from the height of the interests of the collective, society, and the people; not only should individual interests be subordinate to the interests of the collective, society, and the people, but this "I" should also make the best effort to expand the interests of the collective, society, and the people. This is the correct way to place "I."

    “我”的摆法
    马前卒
    学习总路线，首先要端正“我”的摆法。
    我们经常会说，个人的利益必须服从集体、社会和人民的利益。但在具体工作过程中可就不一定那样。
    在一个单位里，同志之间有时也爱比等级和待遇。“我”的能力不比你弱，你居然高我一级， “我”不服气。同级的呢，能力强的，往往感到委屈。“哼，他竟能和我列在同一级，而‘我’呢？”接着，自然还是一个“哼”！
    有些领导干部，一谈起工作，总是“我这单位”工作怎样怎样，或者说，“我这单位”工作从来没有犯过错误，既不爱说“我们”，“单位”上面仅有一个“我”；也很少想到戏是难于独脚唱得好的；一个单位工作的成就，不全靠领导，更应该说是靠集体的共同努力。一个同志的错误，也未必没有自己的一份，领导的更不用说。工作从来不犯错误，是好的，但重要的还须检查成就是怎样的，这才是“向前看”的精神。太看重“我”的人，对工作总容易故步自封，“但求无过”；或者是，不从工作的实际结合着政策出发，专门揣摩领导个人的意图，借以讨好领导。
    也有这样的人，一报告起工作来，总是“我呀我的”，“我”怎样怎样做了工作；“我”讲了话，怎样引起广大群众的欢迎；“我”早已说过，这么干是不行的；好，现在上级来批评了，这可不关“我”的事。这样的人，就是把“我”摆在集体之上或集体之外的；“英雄”是够“英雄”的了，也许是个诸葛亮，然而是个人英雄主义。或者是事后诸葛亮；还是有害集体的。
    应该多多记住“我们”或“咱们”。从集体、社会和人民的利益的高度来衡量这个“我”；不仅要使个人的利益服从于集体、社会和人民的利益，而且要使这个“我”尽最善的努力来扩大集体、社会和人民的利益。这才是正确的“我”的摆法。
