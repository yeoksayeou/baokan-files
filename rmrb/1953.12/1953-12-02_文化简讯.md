Inner Mongolia Health School Trains a Large Number of Medical Workers

The health services in the Inner Mongolia region were extremely backward in the past, and there was a particular shortage of medical personnel. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government founded the Inner Mongolia Health School in 1949 to train various types of medical personnel. According to statistics, it has trained more than 1,600 medical personnel of various ethnic groups, including doctors, midwives, and nurses, in the past four years. After graduation, these students were assigned to work in various cities and vast pastoral and rural areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. They have now become the backbone of the work in the more than 1,200 newly established hospitals, health clinics, epidemic prevention stations, and maternal and child health stations throughout the region.

    内蒙古地区的卫生事业过去极为落后，医务人员也特别缺乏。内蒙古自治区人民政府于一九四九年创办了内蒙古卫生学校，培养各种医务人员。据统计，四年来已先后培养出医生、助产士、护士等各族医务人员一千六百多名。这些学生毕业后即被分配到内蒙古自治区的各个城市和广大牧区及乡村工作，现在他们在全区新建立起来的一千二百多个医院、卫生所、防疫站和妇婴保健站等医疗机构中已成为工作的骨干。
