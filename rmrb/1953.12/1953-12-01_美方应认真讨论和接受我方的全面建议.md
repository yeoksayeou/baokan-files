    At the resumed meeting of representatives of both sides on the political conference issue on November 30th, the Korean-Chinese side put forward a comprehensive proposal regarding the five items on the agenda of the talks. This is another sincere effort on our part to promote an agreement between the two sides on a fair and reasonable basis, so that the political conference can be convened as soon as possible. It will be a serious test of whether the US side is sincere in convening a political conference.
    Regarding the issue of the composition of the political conference, which the US side uses to obstruct and delay the talks, our side has put forward extremely clear suggestions. In order to remove the US side's excuse for obstructing and delaying the talks, and in accordance with the actual situation of the parties to the Korean Armistice Agreement, our side has specifically clarified the term "both sides" in the new proposal: our side is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China, and the US side is the sixteen countries participating in the Korean War and South Korea. All decisions of the political conference must be agreed upon unanimously by the relevant countries on the above-mentioned two sides, and shall be binding on each signatory country. However, in order to ensure the smooth progress of the political conference, our side firmly insists that the political conference should invite the Soviet Union, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Burma, five relevant neutral countries, to participate as members of the political conference, without belonging to either side. The neutral countries should participate in the discussion of all agenda items agreed upon by both sides without any restrictions, and participate in the subsidiary bodies of the political conference, providing opinions to facilitate the reaching of an agreement between the two sides, but not participating in any voting.
    This is completely in accordance with the provisions of Article 60 of the Armistice Agreement. In particular, it stipulates equal rights and obligations for the relevant countries on both sides of the Armistice Agreement. Every country on both sides participates in voting, and if any country has different opinions, consultations will continue. This not only prevents any country from depriving other countries on its own side of their right to vote and express opinions, but also ensures that the agreements reached through such full consultation have greater binding force.
    Regarding the location, time, procedures, administration, and expenses of the political conference, our side has also put forward affirmative and clear reasonable propositions in the comprehensive proposal. In particular, regarding the procedure, our side proposes that the urgent issue of prisoners of war should be discussed first, and then the issue of withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea, the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and other relevant issues should be discussed in order.
    There is no doubt that our comprehensive proposal is a fair, reasonable, practical, and constructive proposal. The only question now is the sincerity of the US side. In view of the situation in the past period of talks, the US side's attitude has been extremely dishonest. All those who care about the political conference must be sufficiently vigilant and urge the US side to change its delaying and slippery attitude.
    People see that, regarding the central issue of neutral countries participating in the political conference, the US representative Dean put forward so-called "twelve-point proposals" on November 28th, which on the one hand continued to deny the status of the Soviet Union as a neutral country, and on the other hand continued to be vague and refused to express a clear attitude. In his so-called "proposals," Dean even blatantly insulted neutral countries. According to Dean's so-called "proposals," these neutral countries "will only have the right to speak at the conference on agenda items agreed upon by both sides at a time, place, meeting, and committee unanimously agreed upon by both sides, and in a manner unanimously agreed upon by both sides, and only on topics scheduled by both sides for discussion at the conference and in the order in which both sides have scheduled these topics for discussion." Not only that, according to Dean's "proposals," these neutral countries have no "right to participate in the political conference outside the above-mentioned defined scope." This means that as long as the US side disagrees with allowing neutral countries to speak on all agenda items, they will not be able to attend the conference at all; even if the US side agrees to their attendance and speech, they will be subject to many restrictions, and even the way they speak must be in accordance with the format prescribed by the US side. This fully demonstrates that the US side intends to insult neutral countries and attempts to make neutral countries lose their due role in participating in the political conference.
    Dean's so-called "proposals" say on the one hand: "Each government participating in the political conference should only be bound by the specific agreements it adheres to"; on the other hand, they say: "But in voting, each side should vote as a single unit." This is extremely contradictory. Since each side should vote as a single unit, and each government acting as part of this unit can not be bound by the outcome of the vote, then what is the meaning of such voting?
    Equally intolerable is Dean's dilatory and rogue attitude in the talks between the two sides. On the issue of the location of the political conference, he casually proposed South Africa and Franco's Madrid, Spain, as possible meeting locations; on the issue of time, he first said that a specific date must be set and proposed the obviously impossible date of December 15th, but now he is attempting to postpone the date to the indefinite future. He takes up a lot of time at each meeting to babble, even bringing up the fact that his house and Roosevelt's house are not far apart, and his dissatisfaction with the open-air toilets in Panmunjom to the meeting. Dean's intention to deliberately delay the talks between the two sides and make it impossible for the talks to progress is so obvious that even the US Associated Press admitted: "Dean's seemingly ridiculous criticisms of the Panmunjom talks are merely to buy time."
    The purpose of Dean's deliberate delay of the talks between the two sides is clearly an attempt to drag the talks past January 22nd of next year, which is the so-called detention deadline for prisoners of war. At that time, the United States intends to unilaterally handle the more than 20,000 prisoners of war who have not yet been given explanations, and forcibly detain them. The governments and people of all countries who long for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue cannot tolerate this conspiracy of the US side.
    After putting forward a comprehensive proposal, the Korean-Chinese side has agreed to the US side's adjournment until December 2nd for the next meeting. However, it must be pointed out that only if the US side changes its delaying attitude towards the talks, seriously considers and accepts our fair and reasonable comprehensive proposal, will it be possible for the future talks to make substantial progress, which will be conducive to the early convening of the political conference.

### 美方应认真讨论和接受我方的全面建议

    美方应认真讨论和接受我方的全面建议
    在十一月三十日恢复举行的关于政治会议问题的双方会谈代表会议上，朝中方面已就会谈的五项议程提出了一个全面的建议。这是我方推动双方会谈在公平合理的基础上达成协议、以便政治会议能够尽早召开的又一次真诚的努力。它对于美方有无诚意召开政治会议将是一个严重的考验。
    关于政治会议的成员问题，即美方用以阻挠与拖延双方会谈的主要问题，我方提出了极明确的建议。我方为了解除美方阻挠和拖延双方会谈的藉口，并符合朝鲜停战协定缔约双方的实际情况，在新的建议中特别对“双方”一词作了明确的解释：我方是朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国，美方是参加侵朝战争的十六个国家和南朝鲜。政治会议的一切决定，必须取得上述双方有关国家的一致同意，并对每一签字国都具有约束力。但为了保证政治会议的顺利进行，我方坚决主张政治会议应邀苏联、印度、印度尼西亚、巴基斯坦和缅甸五个有关中立国家参加，作为政治会议的成员，而不属于双方的任何一方。中立国家应不受任何限制地参加政治会议经过双方协议的全部议程项目的讨论，并参加政治会议的附属机构，提供意见，以利于推动双方达成协议，但不参加一切表决。
    这是完全符合于停战协定第六十款的规定的。特别是它对于停战协定缔约双方有关各国，规定具有同等的权利和义务，双方每一个国家一律参加表决，任何一个国家有不同的意见即继续进行协商。这样就不仅可以防止任何一个国家剥夺它自己方面其他国家的表决权和表示意见的机会，而且这样经过充分协商所达成的协议，必然具有更大的约束力量。
    关于政治会议的地点、时间、程序、行政和经费等问题，我方在全面建议中也提出了肯定而明确的合理主张。特别是程序问题，我方主张首先要讨论急待解决的战俘问题，然后按次序讨论解决从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队问题、和平解决朝鲜问题和其他有关问题。
    毫无疑问，我方的这个全面建议，是公平合理而又切实可行的建设性的建议。现在的问题全在于美方的诚意如何了。鉴于过去这一段会谈的情形，美方的态度是极不老实的。一切关心政治会议的人们，必须提起足够的警惕，并促使美方改变它的拖延和滑头的态度。
    人们看到，对于中立国参加政治会议这个中心问题，美方代表迪安在十一月二十八日提出了所谓“十二点建议”，它一面继续否定苏联的中立国的地位，一面继续含糊其词，拒不表示明确的态度。迪安在他的所谓“建议”中，甚至明目张胆地对中立国家进行侮辱。按照迪安的所谓“建议”，这些中立国家“将仅有权在会议上就双方同意的议程项目在双方一致同意的时间、场合、会议和委员会上和双方一致同意的方式下发言，并且只能就双方预定在会议中讨论的题目并按照双方预定的讨论这些题目的次序发言。”不仅如此，按照迪安的“建议”，这些中立国家还没有在上述“规定的范围以外参加政治会议的权利”。这就是说，只要美方在所有各项议程上都不同意让中立国发言，他们就根本不能出席会议；即使美方同意他们出席发言，也要受到许多限制，甚至他们讲话的方式，也要按照美方规定的格式。这充分表现了美方存心侮辱中立国家，并企图使中立国家失去参加政治会议的应有作用。
    迪安的所谓“建议”一面说：“参加政治会议的每个政府，应该只受它所遵守的特定的协定的约束”；一面又说：“但是在表决时，每方应以一个单位来进行表决”。这是极端矛盾的。既然每方应作为一个单位来投票，而作为这个单位的每个政府却可以不遵守投票结果的约束，那末，这种投票有什么意义呢？
    同样使人不能容忍的，是迪安在双方会谈中那种拖延时间的无赖态度。在政治会议的地点问题上，他信口把南非和佛朗哥西班牙的马德里也提出作为会议地点；在时间问题上，他先说必须规定具体日期，并提出了明知不可能的十二月十五日，现在却企图把日期推延到无限期的将来。他在每次会议上占去很长的时间胡扯，甚至把他的家和罗斯福的家相隔不远，他对板门店的露天厕所不满也拿到会上来谈。迪安居心拖延时间，使双方会谈无法进展的意图是那样明显，甚至连美国的合众社也承认：“迪安之所以开始提出他对板门店会谈的简直是滑稽的批评，不过是为了拖延时间罢了。”
    迪安故意拖延双方会谈的目的，显然是企图把双方会谈拖过明年一月二十二日它所谓的战俘拘留期限，到那时候，美国就打算片面地处理二万多名还没有听解释的战俘，强迫把他们扣留。对于美方的这种阴谋，一切渴望朝鲜问题和平解决的国家的政府和人民，都是不能容忍的。
    朝中方面在提出了全面的建议之后，已同意美方休会到十二月二日再开。但是，必须指出，只有美方改变它对于会谈的拖延态度，认真考虑并接受我方的这个公平合理的全面建议，才有可能使今后的会谈有切实的进展，以利于政治会议的早日召开。
