    The Third Detachment of the Central Forest Survey Team
    Uses the Soviet Forest Management Survey Method to Survey the Bailongjiang Forest Area
    The Third Detachment of the Central Forest Survey Team achieved success in surveying the Bailongjiang Forest Area in Gansu Province using the advanced Soviet forest management survey method. The Bailongjiang Forest Area is an undeveloped virgin forest, storing a large amount of construction timber. In order to develop this forest area and better carry out forest management survey work within the passes, the Third Detachment of the Central Forest Survey Team arrived in the area in September this year to test the advanced Soviet forest management survey method. The mountains in the Bailongjiang Forest Area are high and steep, with some mountain tops covered with snow all year round, and slopes generally between 30 and 40 degrees, some even exceeding 50 degrees. However, due to the active study and efforts to overcome difficulties by all personnel, work efficiency has gradually increased from cutting more than 100 meters of survey lines per day to 300 meters, 500 meters, 1,000 meters, and recently to more than 2,000 meters. The facts fully prove that the advanced Soviet forest management survey method is not only suitable for areas outside the passes, but also completely applicable to mountainous forest areas within the passes with high mountains and steep slopes.
    The management survey method is the advanced Soviet experience in surveying forests, and its main characteristics are: practicality and tight organization. In the past, most forest surveys were not coordinated with logging and afforestation, and were conducted for the sake of surveying. The management survey method is highly comprehensive. In terms of forest resource surveys, it can solve the three different processes of surveying, investigation, and design in one fell swoop. In the past survey methods, internal and external operations were isolated and carried out in a manual manner, wasting time and manpower. The internal and external operations of the management survey method are closely linked in time, so that the work is carried out rhythmically, which is an advanced assembly line operation method. At the same time, there is a certain work quota and a complete set of systems. In terms of deployment, division of labor, reporting, and inspection, it can give full play to collective strength and the collective creativity of the masses.
    Currently, the Central Forest Survey Team is conducting a survey of the Gongba River Basin forest area, preparing to complete this task by the end of the year.
      Note: The forest management survey method is to cut survey lines manually in the forest area, dividing the forest area into several square or rectangular management units, and then conduct surveys along the survey lines by unit on tree species, age, average height, average diameter, density, stock volume, and other aspects. Based on the survey results, a complete set of forest management plans is then compiled. This is a set of methods in which measurement, investigation, and plan-making are closely coordinated and form a complete system. It has been implemented in the Northeast forest area for three years. Facts have proved that it not only saves four to five times more manpower and material resources than the old method, but also provides reliable materials for forest development.

    中央森林调查队第三大队
    运用苏联森林经理调查法调查白龙江林区
    中央森林调查队第三大队运用苏联先进的森林经理调查法，调查甘肃省白龙江林区获得成功。白龙江林区是一个未经开发的原始大森林，积蓄着大量的建设木材。中央森林调查队第三大队为了开发这个林区，并更好地开展关内森林经理调查工作，在今年九月间到达该地，试用苏联先进的森林经理调查法进行调查。白龙江林区的山又高又陡，有的山顶常年积雪，坡度一般在三、四十度，有的还超过五十度。但由于全体人员积极钻研、努力克服困难，工作效率已由每天伐开测线一百多公尺逐渐增加到三百公尺、五百公尺、一千公尺，最近已进展到二千多公尺。事实完全证明了苏联先进的森林经理调查法不仅适用于关外，而且完全适用于山高坡陡的关内山地林区。
    经理调查法是苏联调查森林的先进经验，主要特点是：切合实际、组织严密。过去的林野调查大都与采伐、造林不相配合，为调查而调查。经理调查法具有高度的综合性，在森林资源调查方面，能一举而解决了测量、调查和设计三个不同的过程。过去调查方法中的内、外作业是孤立的，以手工业方式进行，浪费时间和人力。经理调查法的内外作业在时间上紧密衔接，使工作有节奏的进行，是先进的流水作业法。同时有一定的工作定额，有一套完整的制度，在布置、分工、汇报、检查方面都能发挥集体力量和群众的集体创造性。
    现在中央森林调查队正在进行贡把河流域林区的调查工作，准备在年底完成这项任务。
      按：森林经理调查法是用人工在林地伐开测线，将林区划成若干正方形或长方形的经营单位，然后顺着测线按单位进行树种、树龄、平均高度、平均直径、疏密度、蓄积量等方面的调查。根据调查结果再编制一整套的森林经营计划。这是从测量、调查以至做出计划都密切配合而有完整体系的一套方法。东北林区已实行了三年，事实证明不仅在人力、物力上比旧法节约了四、五倍以上，而且对森林开发方面提供了可靠的材料。
