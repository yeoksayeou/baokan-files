Huang Qixiang and Jin Cheng, deputy heads of the first general sub-delegation, led some representatives to visit the units directly under the leadership of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, logistics organs, and some special forces from November 1st to 18th. On December 2nd, He Long and others went to a certain place on the eastern front of Korea to visit the Korean People's Army.

Soldiers of a certain unit of the People's Army entrusted the delegation with many trophies and souvenirs they made themselves to the Chinese people, to express their gratitude.

　　The third general sub-delegation visited a certain unit of the Volunteer Army in the wind and snow. The soldiers of this unit firmly expressed to the delegation representatives that they would strictly guard their posts and thoroughly complete the glorious task of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. The representatives of the third general sub-delegation also visited a certain tank unit of the Volunteer Army and, accompanied by young tank soldiers, visited the giant tanks donated by the people of the motherland.

　　Representatives and members of the cultural troupe of the fourth general sub-delegation braved the severe cold of minus ten degrees Celsius and crossed the 1,000-meter-high Mount Osong to conduct visits and performances at the Shangganling and "D-Shaped Mountain" positions.

The reports made by the representatives in various places on the Chinese people's resistance to U.S. aggression and aid to Korea and economic construction greatly encouraged the confidence of the Korean people in accelerating the work of restoration and construction. When the delegation representatives arrived at the Hungnam Fertilizer Factory, the workers excitedly lifted the representatives up and said that they would respond to the care of the Chinese people by overfulfilling the production plan.
