　　As autumn harvest had just begun, the farmers of Shuangqiao Village were already filling their granaries with newly made bins of all sizes. Before the crops in the fields were even fully threshed, the bins were packed full. Everyone said: This year, Shaanxi Province has a "double harvest," and Shuangqiao Village also has "double happiness." The summer wheat was a high-yield village in Qishan County, and the autumn harvest was the best it had been in many years. The village's 1,640 mu of land yielded a total of more than 438,000 jin of grain in both summer and autumn, an increase of more than 53,000 jin compared to last year. In the past, the bins were never full, but this year they weren't enough, so the village bought 65 new bins.

　　Mentioning Shuangqiao Village's increased grain production this year brings up the story of three cadres. One is Deputy Township Head Huang Miao, and the other two are Village Head Huang Yi and Deputy Village Head Wang Xing. The story begins with Huang Miao being forced onto the city wall.

　　"Five Excesses" Forced Huang Miao onto the City Wall

　　Before last autumn, Huang Miao was still the village head of Shuangqiao Village. At that time, as he himself said: "I was everything—'born,' 'ugly,' 'painted face,' 'female role'—I was everything. I was the civil affairs commissioner, evaluation commissioner, public security commissioner... I held twelve positions concurrently. In the whole village's drama, I was the 'general going out to battle' and the 'prime minister entering the palace,' I handled everything." During the land survey and production determination, he had to measure more than 700 mu of land a day. He held a loudspeaker and ran from one end of the village to the other, shouting until his voice was hoarse. At night, he couldn't sleep for several nights, guarding the abacus to calculate the land area, his eyes swollen like two red peaches. As soon as the land survey and production determination were over, the township meetings never stopped. Today it was the Farmers' Association Committee, tomorrow it was the Seed Improvement Team Leader Meeting. One day, he attended several meetings in a row, and he himself couldn't figure out which committee members were attending. When it was time to hoe wheat, the township wanted to know the number of mu hoed each day, and the number of men and women hoeing. During the day, he ran around collecting statistics, and at night he carried a rifle (because there were many wolves at that time) to report to the township. He often didn't get home until late at night. His wife saw him running around outside all day, neglecting the work at home, and she was very unhappy, sometimes not even leaving him any food. Huang Miao was busy outside all day, and when he went back, he still had to rush to do some work and eat some cold food, which made him sick to his stomach, and he still hasn't recovered. One evening in February last year, just after arranging work, a northwest wind suddenly blew, and it looked like there would be frost the next morning. At that time, Huang Miao remembered that he was also the head of the frost prevention team, so he immediately instructed the whole village to prevent frost, running around until after midnight before returning home. He called at the door for a long time, but his wife wouldn't get up to open it for him. Later, his mother opened the door for him while scolding. As soon as he entered the door, his wife scolded him: "You drank snake oil, you're gone all day, and no one cuts the cow grass." Huang Miao was tired and hungry, and he was in a bad mood, so he argued with his wife. The next day, he moved to sleep on the Dongguan city wall alone.

　　Freeing Hands to Engage in Production

　　Last autumn, after the democratic political construction work team arrived in Shuangqiao Village and discovered these problems, they implemented simplified organizations, reduced concurrent posts, reduced meetings, and concentrated efforts on production. Five groups were established in the village: production, finance and grain, civil affairs, public security, and culture and education. The group leaders and village head were all democratically elected by the villagers. Huang Miao was elected as deputy township head (only concurrently serving as director of the Farmers' Association), and the township government designated him to focus on doing a good job in this village.

　　Although these changes had been made, disputes in the village continued. Even the cadres and the groups didn't work well together. Once, Huang Miao called a meeting of the group leaders to arrange production work, but he couldn't get all the people together for half a day. Production group leader Wang Shirong didn't come even after being called two or three times. Huang Miao criticized Wang Shirong at the meeting: "You shouldn't make people call you several times, and still sit on your wife's warm kang and not come down." After the meeting, Wang Shirong said to others: "Huang Miao is always looking for my faults, I don't think I can do it!"

　　The problems of each group increased day by day, and Huang Miao became troubled. He thought that he couldn't handle it when he was alone before, but now that there were more people, could it still be the same as before? He discussed it with Village Head Huang Yi and Deputy Village Head Wang Xing. The three frowned for a long time, and Wang Xing, an old man, said: "Leading the groups should be done smoothly, don't make it stiff. If he doesn't come to a meeting once, don't give him a hard time." Huang Yi said: "It's wrong for us to solve problems without the group leaders." Huang Miao also added: "That's right! We should pay attention to uniting the group leaders. Otherwise, if you say it's a wolf and he says it's a tiger, the work won't be done well, and people will be exhausted! We should be generous and let people make suggestions. When doing work, we should go to the places where people chat and collect the opinions of the masses." After the three finished talking, Huang Yi apologized to the civil affairs group leader, and Huang Miao responded to Wang Shirong, and Wang Shirong also examined himself for not being on time for the meeting.

　　From then on, the work of each group slowly got going. General problems were handled by the group concerned, and larger tasks such as implementing the Marriage Law were handled jointly by all groups. The civil affairs group handled more than 30 disputes of all sizes in a year, and the finance and grain group urged the whole village to pay public grain in six days, more than 20 days faster than in previous years. From then on, Huang Miao and the two village heads freed up their hands to concentrate on helping the production group lead the village's production.

　　Educating Farmers Requires Patience

　　When it was almost time to plant winter wheat last year, Huang Miao and the two village heads had been discussing how to increase production for several days. They studied that the wheat in Xiaoqiang Village yielded two or three dou per mu more than in previous years, one of the main reasons being that they planted Bimayi No. 1 (a famous high-quality wheat variety in the Northwest). They further studied: Xiaoqiang, Jinggong and other villages are only seven li away from Shuangqiao Village, and the soil is the same. If they can plant it, Shuangqiao can also plant it. Moreover, many villagers pass by Xiaoqiang Village when they go to the market or attend meetings, and not only have they seen with their own eyes that Bimayi No. 1 grows well, but they have also inquired about the cultivation techniques. Therefore, it is possible to promote Bimayi No. 1 throughout the village. Then Huang Miao and others publicized, mobilized, and organized the promotion of high-quality seed competitions. The whole village planned to replace all 862 mu of "grasshopper wheat" with Bimayi No. 1. Huang Miao and the two village heads also personally negotiated with Jinggong Village and exchanged for enough Bimayi No. 1 for the whole village to use.

　　Although enough wheat seeds had been exchanged, things didn't go smoothly when planting. One day, Huang Jie, a 56-year-old man, took Bimayi No. 1 and was about to go to the field, but suddenly changed his mind: He had been planting grasshopper wheat for generations, and he was afraid it would be rash to replace it all with Bimayi No. 1 this year. He ran home again and scooped some grasshopper wheat and mixed it with Bimayi No. 1. In the middle of planting, he planted two mu of pure grasshopper wheat.

　　At a village cadre meeting, someone talked about this matter. Some young people were unhappy and said that he had undermined the village's production increase plan. Huang Miao also advocated that he be asked to explain at a mass meeting. At this time, the mature and experienced Village Head Huang Yi said calmly: "I don't think we should do that, just let him plant it. When this kind of thing happens, we should wait a little longer. Next year, when his wheat yields less, he will naturally plant Bimayi No. 1." Huang Yi's words reminded Huang Miao, and he also remembered what the district committee secretary had once said to him: "'The serious problem is educating the peasants,' this is what Chairman Mao told us. While we educate the peasants, we must also be able to wait for the peasants." He agreed with Huang Yi's opinion. Afterwards, Huang Miao thought about this matter for a long time, and even went to talk to the district committee secretary about it. The district committee secretary said to him: "You are active and enthusiastic in your work, and you have made many achievements, which is good. However, in the past, the entire village's work was placed on you alone, and sometimes the work couldn't be pushed forward, so the approach was a bit rigid. The leadership also has some responsibility for this, and we can't completely blame you, but you must pay special attention to correcting this in the future. Although Huang Yi is young, he is stable and patient in his work. Now that you can learn from each other and learn from each other's strengths, the village's work will be done well."

　　Both Manure and Sleeping on a Warm Kang

　　In winter, the nights are long, and Huang Miao often lay on the kang thinking: How can we lay a more solid foundation for increasing production next year? He thought that his property and his uncle's were divided into "two halves," but for several years, his uncle's grain had always been more than his own. What was the reason? It turned out that his uncle saved more manure. He thought: If the whole village could save more manure, they would definitely produce more grain. However, there was an old habit in the village to dry the manure in winter and burn it to heat the kang, which was a pity! One day, Huang Miao met Huang Yi and discussed changing everyone's habit of burning manure. After discussion among the cadres, they reached a consensus. At a mass meeting in the whole village, Huang Miao gave everyone a detailed account: Each animal can save at least six large carts of manure in three months of winter. The whole village has a total of 97 animals, which can save 582 large carts of manure. Adding one cart of manure per mu of land can yield at least nine jin more grain, and the whole village can yield more than 5,200 jin of grain. Unfortunately, in the past, everyone burned manure to heat the kang, which was a great loss. After this calculation, everyone stared and became interested. However, when the topic turned to not using manure to heat the kang in winter, many people asked in return: "Can we do without sleeping on a warm kang in winter? It's okay for adults to be cold, but what if the children wet the bed at night and catch a cold?" Everyone discussed it again, and it was decided that they still had to sleep on a warm kang, and let the women sweep up rotten firewood to burn the kang. Then the women raised objections: "We have never swept it before. What wind is blowing so hard this year?! You talk about improving women's status every day, but you haven't improved it yet, and you're already putting more pressure on us, asking us to sweep up rotten firewood. We won't sweep it!" After repeated explanations, it was finally passed at the meeting.

　　After several days, no one had taken action yet. Huang Miao and the two village heads discussed it and went to the women's representative Li Xiuyun, asking her to set an example for everyone first. The next day, Li Xiuyun mobilized several women and went to the fields to sweep. In three days, each person swept nine baskets of rotten firewood. This time, many women followed suit. However, there were still some people who secretly dried manure and burned it to heat the kang. Huang Miao and the village heads and group leaders checked separately, patiently persuading, and the manure saving campaign gradually unfolded in the whole village. Some people exchanged walls and pot kangs, and some people even carried manure baskets to pick up manure when visiting relatives.

　　The manure in the whole village became more and more abundant. Some elderly people, looking at the manure piles in front of each house, frowned and said: "The manure has been saved, but the land is far away, there are few carts, and it's useless if it can't be transported to the fields." In fact, Huang Miao and the village heads had already been studying this problem. By the end of November, the village cadres organized all 16 carts in the village, changing people and animals, but not changing the carts, and transporting manure to the fields day and night. The sound of wheels, shouts, and whips echoed constantly. In more than a month, all 6,100 large carts of manure in the village were transported to the fields. Everyone happily said: "In previous winters, the cadres ran around and didn't know what they were busy with, but this winter they were busy with the right thing."

　　Use New Walking Plows to Turn Wheat Fields

　　When it was almost time to turn wheat fields this year, the cooperative brought 27 new walking plows to the village, asking everyone to try them out first. After the plows were transported, Huang Miao thought to himself: This is the first time the plows have met the villagers. If this "cannon" doesn't fire well, it will be difficult to promote them in the future. So he found the cadre who lent the plows and taught his mutual aid team how to use the plows. They learned the techniques of using the plows for a morning and an afternoon, and everyone mastered the knack and turned over the wheat fields.

　　Some people saw them using walking plows to turn the fields and said: "Their team has someone to teach them, who will teach our team?" When Huang Miao heard this, he immediately publicized the usage of the walking plows and personally went to the fields to teach everyone. The young people quickly learned. Some elderly people said: "That's made for young people, we're used to old plows and can't learn it." When Huang Miao heard this, he discussed it with the two village heads and found Huang Zhe, a 57-year-old man, to try plowing in the fields. Huang Miao taught him several times, and Huang Zhe started plowing on his own. Other elderly people also started using new walking plows at this time.

　　One day, Huang Miao heard someone say: "People with good animals can use this plow, if the animals are small, they can't pull it." He knew that Huang Shenyi had a donkey, so he asked Huang Shenyi to harness the donkey and try plowing in the fields. He told Huang Shenyi to hang the animal harness hook lower, and the plow became lighter. Huang Shenyi, while holding the plow, kept singing "Luantan Opera" while turning the fields.

　　Wang Zhenqi borrowed a walking plow but didn't use it, and used an old plow to turn the fields. Huang Miao advised him to use the new plow, but he ignored him. One day, Wang Zhenqi and Wang Xing turned the fields side by side. Huang Miao deliberately went to Wang Xing's field and talked about the benefits of using walking plows. Wang Zhenqi listened in the field, stopped the cow, ran to see the field turned over by Wang Xing with the new plow, and after watching for a while, he asked Huang Miao anxiously: "Do you have time to teach me tomorrow?"

　　In a few days, all 27 walking plows in the village were turning wheat fields.

　　Cadres Taking the Lead

　　When leading production, Huang Miao remembered a sentence that some people in the masses had used to satirize him before: "The village head blindly planted peas in the ground, we have to learn from the village head!" This happened during the summer harvest last year. At that time, everyone was "seizing grain from the jaws of the dragon," but Huang Miao couldn't participate in production. He was either busy reporting to the township or busy collecting various statistics in the summer harvest. After delaying things several times, he suddenly encountered continuous overcast rain and blindly planted his two mu of peas in the ground, and more than ten mu in the village were also blindly planted. Some people started ridiculing him like this. This gave Huang Miao a profound lesson: In the future, cadres must take the lead in production themselves in order to do a good job in the village's production.

　　One morning in June this year, Huang Miao and the members of the mutual aid team went to the field. According to the maturity period of Bimayi No. 1 wheat, they started harvesting Huang Zhiguo's wheat. As soon as they cut down a piece, Huang Zhiguo's father wouldn't let them cut it anymore, complaining that the wheat kernels were not fully ripe. Huang Miao explained to him that Bimayi No. 1 wheat matures early, and if they wait until it's fully ripe before cutting it, the kernels will fall off. Old Huang still refused, so Huang Miao said: "Let's cut mine first, and cut yours in the afternoon." When they cut it in the afternoon, the kernels of this piece of wheat had indeed started to fall off, and Old Huang was convinced.

　　In the evening, as soon as Huang Miao entered the village, Huang Shijin ran over and said: "Huang Quan's mother is going to jump into the well, complaining that our mutual aid team harvested her wheat too early." Just as he was saying this, people from Wang Xing's mutual aid team reported that this dispute had occurred. At this time, Huang Miao said: "This is a new problem, we publicized it once before, but the masses still can't accept it." At the same time, he quickly asked people to use loudspeakers to broadcast the fact that the wheat in Huang Zhiguo's field was falling off to the whole village. After two broadcasts, all the wheat in the village was harvested on time, and there were no more losses.

　　Whether it was harvesting, preventing frost, or controlling pests, the village cadres took the lead and set an example for everyone. The mutual aid team that Huang Miao participated in also became a good mutual aid team in the whole district under his help and was praised by everyone. This year, Huang Miao's family has also changed greatly. This year, the autumn harvest alone yielded more than two shi more than last year. In the past, when someone was looking for Huang Miao, his father always liked to ridicule: "He's the village head, the village head is not here." Now, when Huang Miao leads a team to deliver public grain, his father even gives him travel expenses. In the past, Huang Miao was busy with work and often ate cold rice and steamed buns, but now, if he misses a meal, his wife rushes to hug firewood and start a fire for him, and he will never move to the city wall to sleep again.

    黄淼把双桥村的生产领导好了
    马汉卿  刘广
    刚开始秋收，双桥村农民的粮仓里，就摆上了新添的大大小小的囤子。场上的庄稼还没打完，囤子就装得满满的了。大家都说：今年陕西省是“双料丰收”，双桥村也是“双喜临门”。夏田是岐山全县的小麦丰产村，秋田又是多年没有过的好收成。全村一千六百四十亩地，秋夏两季一共收了四十三万八千多斤粮食，比去年多收五万三千多斤。往年囤子还装不满，今年却都不够用了，就这样，全村添买了六十五个新囤子。
    提到双桥村今年多打粮食，就引起三个干部的故事来。这三个干部，一个是副乡长黄淼，两个是正副村长黄镒和王兴。故事要从黄淼被逼上城楼讲起。
    “五多”把黄淼逼上城楼
      去年秋天以前，黄淼还是双桥村的村长。那时候，正像他自己所说的：“生、丑、净、旦全是我，什么民政委员、评议委员、治安委员……一个人兼了十二职。全村这台戏，‘出将’是我，‘入相’还是我，全部包了。”查田定产的时候，一天要丈量七百多亩地。他拿着广播筒从东头跑到西头，把嗓子都喊哑了。晚上，连着几夜不能睡觉，守着算盘算地亩，眼睛肿的像两颗红桃一样。查田定产一结束，乡上的会开的不停，今天是农协委员会，明天是换良种组长会。有一天连着开了几个会，弄的他自己也闹不清楚什么委员来参加。锄开麦啦，乡上要每天锄麦的亩数，锄麦的男、女各有多少？白天跑来跑去统计数字，晚上背上长枪（那时候狼多）到乡上汇报。常常闹到半夜三更，还回不了家。他老婆见他一天光在外面跑，丢下自己家里的活没人作，很不高兴，有时连饭都不给他留。黄淼在外忙了一天，回去还要赶着做些活，再吃上些冷饭，肚子里就得下病，直到现在还没治好。去年二月的一天晚上，刚刚布置完工作，猛然刮起西北风，看样子，第二天早晨要下霜。当时黄淼想起自己还是防霜小组长，就马上向全村人布置防霜，东奔西跑，一直弄到多半夜才回家，在门外叫了好大功夫，他老婆都不起来给他开门。后来还是他妈一边骂着，一边把门开了。刚进门，老婆就骂他：“喝上长虫（蛇）油了，溜的一天不回家，牛草都没人铡。”黄淼又累又饿，这时也没好气，和老婆吵了一架。第二天就一个人搬到东关城楼上睡觉去了。
      腾出手来搞生产
      去年秋天，民主建政工作组到了双桥村，发现这些情况后，就实行简化组织、减少兼职、减少会议、集中力量搞生产。在村上设立生产、财粮、民政、治安、文教五个组。组长和村长都由全村人民民主选举，黄淼被全乡人民选为副乡长（只兼农会主任），乡政府指定他重点搞好这个村。
      虽然经过了这样变更，但是村里“犁钩相挂、磨头相擦”的纠纷，还是闹个不停；就是干部和各组之间也不合拍。有一次，黄淼召集各组组长开会布置生产工作，半天人都叫不齐。生产组长王世荣两三次都叫不来。黄淼就在会上批评王世荣：“不该让别人叫上几次，还坐在老婆热炕上不下来。”会后，王世荣向别人说：“黄淼光瞅我的缝缝，我看干不成了！”
      各组的问题一天比一天多，黄淼苦恼起来了。他想以前一个人忙不过来，现在人多了还能老像过去一样。他就和村长黄镒、副村长王兴一块研究。三个人皱了半天眉头，王兴老汉说：“领导各组要顺着毛来，不要弄僵了，他一次开会不到，就不要给他红脸。”黄镒说：“我们解决问题，撇开组长是不对的。”黄淼也接着说：“对！我们要注意团结各组长。要不然，你说是狼，他说是虎，工作做不好，还把人累死哩！我们要把气量放大，让人家提意见。做工作要走闲话场子，收集群众的意见。”三人谈完后，黄镒向民政组长承认了不是，黄淼给王世荣回了话，王世荣也检讨了自己开会不该迟到。
    从这以后，各组的工作慢慢搞起来了。遇到一般的问题，是那个组的就由那个组处理，像贯彻婚姻法等较大的工作，各组共同来搞。民政组在一年当中，处理了大小纠纷三十多件，财粮组督促全村人六天中交清了公粮，比往年快二十多天。从这以后，黄淼和两个村长就腾出手来，专心帮助生产组领导全村的生产了。
    教育农民要耐心
    去年快种冬麦的时候，黄淼和两个村长，几天来都商量着怎样增产的问题。他们研究到小强村的小麦，每亩比往年多打了二、三斗，主要原因之一，就是种了碧蚂一号（西北著名的优良麦种）。他们又进一步研究：小强、净宫等村离双桥村只有七里路，土质一样，他们能种，双桥也能种；再说，村里有许多农民赶集、上会时路过小强村，不光亲眼看到碧蚂一号长的好，还打听过作务技术。因此，在全村推广碧蚂一号，是能够做到的。接着黄淼等就宣传、动员和组织推广良种比赛。全村计划把八百六十二亩蚂蚱麦都换成碧蚂一号。黄淼和两个村长又亲自到净宫村交涉，换来了够全村用的碧蚂一号。
    麦种虽然换够了，但下种的时候，并不是一帆风顺。一天，五十六岁的黄杰老汉，拿上碧蚂一号正要下地，忽然又转了念头：几辈子啦都种蚂蚱麦，今年一下子全换上碧蚂一号，怕有点冒失。他又跑回家舀了些蚂蚱麦，和碧蚂一号掺搅起来。下种中间，又种了二亩净蚂蚱麦。
    在一次村干部会议上，有人讲了这件事情。一些年青人就不高兴，说他把全村的增产计划破坏了，黄淼也主张叫他在群众会上交代。这时候，少年老成的村长黄镒不慌不忙地说：“我看不能这样，种上就算了。遇到这号事，我们要多等一下，到明年他的麦子收少了，自然会种碧蚂一号”。黄镒这样一说，倒提醒了黄淼，他也想起有一次区委书记对他说的话：“‘严重的问题是教育农民’，这是毛主席告诉我们的。我们一面要教育农民，一面还要能等待农民。”他同意了黄镒的意见。事后，黄淼为这件事想了很久，还自动去跟区委书记谈了一次。区委书记对他说：“你工作积极、热情，做出许多成绩，这是好的；不过以前全村工作放在你一个人身上，有时候工作推不动，方式上就有点硬，这一点领导上也有责任，不能完全怪你，但以后你得特别注意改正。黄镒虽说年青、工作上还稳重、耐心。你们现在能这样互相学习，取长补短，村上工作是会搞好的。”
    又有粪上，又睡热炕
    冬天夜长，黄淼常躺在炕上想：怎样给明年增产打下更牢固的底子？他想到他和叔父的家当，是“二一添作五”分开的，可是好几年，他叔父的粮食总比自己打的多，什么原因呢？原来是他叔父攒的粪多。他想：如果全村都能多攒粪，一定也会多打粮食。可是，村里有个老习惯，年年冬天把粪晒干烧了炕，这多可惜呀！有一天，黄淼碰见黄镒，就商量改变大家烧粪的习惯，又经过干部讨论，意见一致后，在全村的群众大会上，黄淼就给大家算了一个细账：一头牲口一冬三个月至少可攒六大车粪，全村共有九十七头牲口，就能攒五百八十二大车粪。一亩地多上一车粪，至少能多打九斤粮食，全村就能多打五千二百多斤粮食。可惜往年大家把粪都烧了炕，损失不小。这样一算，大家瞪起眼、动了心；可是话题一转到冬天再不要用粪烧炕，就有许多人反问：“冬天不睡热炕能行吗？大人冻着还没啥，娃娃一晚上尿炕，冻着了怎办？”大伙又研究一番，热炕还是要睡，让妇女们扫拾烂柴草来烧炕。这样妇女又提意见了：“我们从来就没扫过，今年是啥风吹的紧了?！你们天天说提高妇女，还没提高，就又往倒压，叫扫烂柴草，我们就不扫！”经过再三解释，终算在会上通过了。
    过了好几天，还没有人动手。黄淼和两个村长商量了一下，就去找妇女代表李秀云，要她先给大家作榜样。第二天，李秀云动员了几个妇女，下地扫开了。三天功夫，每人扫了九筐子烂柴草。这一下，很多妇女都跟着做起来。但是还有些人，瞒着干部，晒粪烧炕。黄淼又和村长、组长分头检查，耐心说服，全村才一步步展开了攒粪运动，有的换墙、换锅炕，有的人走亲戚家还捎着粪筐拾粪。
    全村的粪越攒越多了。一些老年人，看着各家门前的粪堆，皱着眉头说：“粪是攒下了，可是地远、车少、运不到地里也是枉然。”其实，这个问题黄淼和村长早就在研究了。到了十一月底，村干部把全村十六辆大车组织起来，换人、换牲口、不换车，日夜不停地往地里拉粪。车轮声、吆喝声、鞭子声，响个不断头。一月多功夫，全村六千一百多大车的粪，都拉到地里了。大家高兴地说：“往年冬天，干部东跑西走，不知忙些啥，今年冬天可忙对头了”。
    用新式步犁翻麦地
    今年快翻麦地时，合作社给全村带来二十七张新式步犁，让大家先来试用试用。步犁运来后，黄淼心里就想：步犁和村里人见面，这是头一次，如果这一“炮”打不响，以后再要推广就不容易了。于是他就找到贷犁的干部给他那个互助组教用犁的方法。他们学了一个早上和下午，大家都摸着了使用的窍门，翻开了麦地。
    有些人看见他们用步犁翻地就说：“人家组有人教哩，谁给咱们组教呢？”黄淼听到了，马上就给大家宣传步犁的使用法，又亲自到地里教大家，年青人很快就学会了。一些老年人又说：“那是给年青人造下的，咱用惯旧犁的手学不会。”黄淼听见这种说法，又和两个村长商量，找着五十七岁的黄哲老汉下地试犁。黄淼教了几次，黄哲就自己犁开了。其他老年人这时也跟着用开新式步犁了。
    一天，黄淼又听人说：要有好牲口的人才能使这犁，牲口小就拉不动。他知道黄申宜有一头毛驴，便叫黄申宜套上毛驴到地里试犁。他叫黄申宜把牲口套绳钩往低挂了一下，犁就轻了。黄申宜扶着犁一边翻地，一边不停地唱着“乱弹戏”。
    王振岐贷下步犁不用，拿旧犁翻地，黄淼劝他用新犁，他连理都不理。有一天，王振岐和王兴连畔翻地，黄淼有意到王兴地里，谈开用步犁的好处。王振岐在地里听着听着，停下了牛，跑来看王兴用新犁翻过的地，看了一会，就急的问黄淼：“你明天有功夫给我教吗？”
    没过几天，全村二十七张步犁都翻开麦地了。
    干部起带头作用
    在领导生产的时候，黄淼想起有些群众以前讽刺自己的一句话：“村长把豌豆瞎在地里了，咱们要向村长学习哩！”这事发生在去年夏收当中。那时候，大伙都在“龙口里夺粮”，黄淼却不能参加生产，他不是忙着到乡上汇报，就是忙着统计夏收中的各种数字，三耽误两耽误，忽然碰上连阴雨，把他的二亩豌豆瞎在地里了，村上也瞎了十多亩。有些人就这样讥笑开了。这是给黄淼一个深刻的教训；往后一定要干部自己在生产中带头，才能把全村的生产搞好。
    今年六月的一个早晨，黄淼和互助组员下了地，按照碧蚂一号麦的成熟期，动手收割黄治国的麦，刚割倒一块，黄治国的父亲不让割了，嫌麦颗没有熟透。黄淼给他解释碧蚂一号麦熟的早，等熟透再割就要落颗。老黄还是不依，黄淼就说：“先割我的吧，下午再割你这块。”下午割的时候，这块麦果然开始落颗了，黄老汉这才心服了。
    晚上，黄淼刚进村，黄士金跑来说：“黄权他妈要跳井了，嫌我们互助组把她家的麦割得太早了。”正说着，王兴互助组的人来报告发生了这号纠纷。这时，黄淼一边说：“这是一个新问题，前次宣传过一次，群众还接受不了”；一边连忙叫人用广播筒向全村广播黄治国麦地落颗的事实，经过两次宣传，全村小麦都按时收割了。再没受到损失。
    不论是收割、防霜、治虫，村干部都走在前边，给大家做样子。黄淼参加的互助组，也在他帮助之下成了全区的好互助组，得到大家的赞扬。今年黄淼的家庭也大大变样了。今年光秋田，就比去年多收了二石多。过去有人找黄淼，他父亲总爱讥刺：“人家是村长嘛，村长不在。”现在黄淼带队送公粮，他父亲还给他路费。过去黄淼工作忙，常吃冷饭冷馍，现在有时误了饭，他老婆赶忙给他抱柴烧火，他再也不会搬到城楼睡觉去了。
