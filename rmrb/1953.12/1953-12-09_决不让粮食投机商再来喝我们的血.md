Never Let Grain Speculators Suck Our Blood Again
By our reporter Lin Wei

    During the land reform, peasants all recounted their suffering from exploitation by landlords. During the current discussion of the general line for the transition period and the selling of surplus grain to the state, we have again seen peasants universally recounting their suffering from exploitation by grain speculators. Peasants have ample life experience to recognize that feudalism is a profound disaster, and they also have ample life experience to recognize that capitalism is a similarly profound disaster. All comrades working in rural areas should be confident that just as peasants were able to consciously act under the banner of anti-feudalism in the past, they are now also able to consciously act under the call to oppose the capitalist road, sell surplus grain to the state, and support national economic construction, so that the state can smoothly achieve the general tasks of the transition period and realize socialism.

    Here, let's take Sihhezhuang Village in Tongxian County, Hebei Province, as an example. The 99 peasant households in this village warmly support the general line of transitioning to socialism. However, when the proposal to sell surplus grain to the state was first put forward, there were many concerns. They didn't know if the state buying grain would mean that peasants wouldn't be able to buy it when they urgently needed food (such as in the event of a disaster), leading to famine; or if grain prices and commodity prices would fluctuate, causing peasants to suffer losses. After explanations from higher authorities and their own discussions, the peasants recalled their relationship with the People's Government and with grain speculators in the past regarding the grain issue. This recollection fundamentally awakened the peasants. In the old society, peasants had more frequent and widespread relationships with grain merchants than with landlords. In order to buy clothing, daily necessities, repay debts, and cover various expenses, almost all peasants had to sell grain. And the process of selling grain was precisely the process of grain merchants plundering the peasants. Many peasants recalled: "As soon as the autumn harvest came, peasants were eager to sell grain for money. Whether pulled by carts, carried by donkeys, or shouldered, it was difficult to get the grain to Tongxian City. But when the grain merchants saw that the peasants were eager to sell, they would cross their arms, tilt their heads, and insist that the grain was not selling well and wasn't worth much, deliberately pretending not to buy. The peasants had no choice but to beg them. Then they would buy the grain at a price equivalent to three-quarters, two-thirds, or even one-half of the original price, as if they were doing 'charity'. The grain price was clearly 120,000 yuan yesterday, but today it suddenly dropped to 100,000, 80,000, or 70,000 yuan." When the peasants talked about this, they naturally complained: "At that time, it was a complete trap, impossible to escape or avoid. We knew they were sucking our blood, but we needed money urgently, what could we do! Selling in Tongxian was the same as selling in Beijing. If we didn't sell today, it might be worth even less tomorrow. One trip to the market cost money for food for people and feed for animals, and the travel expenses were also unaffordable!" "The profiteers not only cheated us on the price, but also on the measure! We were afraid that one 'shi' [a unit of dry measure] of grain wouldn't be enough, so we added a few handfuls in advance; but when the profiteers measured it, it was sure to be several 'sheng' [a smaller unit of dry measure] short. This one grabs a handful and rubs it, that one scoops up a handful and looks at it. It was like treasure at our house, but in their hands, it was like dirt, scattered all over the floor! We felt sorry for it, but they were happy. They had special people to sweep up the spilled grain." "When we went to buy things after selling the grain, it was the opposite. The merchants said, 'Cloth is very scarce now, and you can't buy it no matter how expensive it is.' Something that was clearly 10,000 yuan suddenly became 12,000 or 13,000 yuan when we went to buy it. Buying kerosene was the same." "After the New Year, when the old grain ran out and the new grain wasn't yet available, many peasants lacked grain and had to go to the market to buy it. But what we could buy for 120,000 yuan yesterday, we might not be able to buy for 130,000 or 140,000 yuan today." "When there was a drought or flood, and disaster was imminent, the grain price didn't rise by 10 or 20 percent, but by 100 or 200 percent. The grain produced by the peasants' blood and sweat, falling into the hands of the profiteers, now had to be used to control the peasants' lives." Many peasants also cited the issue of buying wheat seeds this autumn as an example. Seeing that it was time to sow wheat, many families needed to buy wheat seeds. The government allocated wheat seeds a step late, and the profiteers immediately raised the price of wheat, which they bought from peasants for just over 20,000 yuan per 'dou' [another unit of dry measure] in the summer, to over 40,000 yuan per 'dou'. The people who spoke said: "If the government hadn't quickly allocated wheat seeds, the wheat price would not only not have come down, but would have risen even further. I don't know how much money we would have lost! Some families had already agreed to buy a 'dou' for over 40,000 yuan with the grain merchants, but when they went to get it, the grain merchants refused to sell it."

    Talking about the situation when peasants lacked grain, peasant Zhang Shuxuan narrated his own experience. His family originally had sixteen mu [a unit of area] of land. In the spring of 1946, they had no grain to eat and no money to buy it, so they borrowed five shi of grain from a grain merchant, with an interest rate of four dou per shi. By the autumn, they owed seven shi including principal and interest. Unable to repay, they only paid two shi of interest. The next spring, they still didn't have enough grain, so they borrowed another three shi, owing a total of eight shi. By the autumn, they owed more than eleven shi. Forced to the point of desperation, they gritted their teeth and sold five mu of land. The grain they got from the sale was used up before they even got home, because they had to repay the debt. The following year, they still had nothing to eat, and the Kuomintang added taxes. With no other choice, they sold another six mu. "We were on the verge of starvation," he said passionately, "Thank God, the Communist Party came! We were liberated! If it weren't for Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, the profiteers would have sucked us dry, even our bones!"

    Many peasants testified that at that time, grain merchants used usurious loans to exploit the peasants so that they fell further and further behind each year. Many sold their houses and land, even becoming destitute, going out to work as hired laborers or doing hard labor, but there were no statistics on this. The interest on grain, four dou, was not the highest; there were also rates of four and a half and five dou.

    The peasants don't fully understand what "capitalism" means yet; but they already understand that if they let the profiteers completely manipulate and control the grain market and other markets, it will bring the peasants such deep pain and disaster.

    Talking about the past, naturally, they also connected it to the present, connecting it to the People's Government. The peasants of Sihhezhuang all remembered that in 1949, there was a disaster, and in the spring of 1950, there was a famine, and many families lacked food. But the grain merchants who specialized in "taking advantage of the peasants' misfortune" to make a fortune were unable to extend their bloody hands this time. The People's Government allocated 28,000 jin [a unit of weight] of interest-free loans of grain, an average of almost two shi per household. Compared with the profiteers' 40% interest, the peasants saved 11,200 jin of interest on this one loan alone. And since that year, the grain merchants have no longer been able to manipulate grain prices, other commodity prices have also stabilized, and the peasants are no longer subjected to the profiteers' cuts and layers of exploitation.

    Fifty-eight households in Sihhezhuang are members of agricultural production cooperatives. These members have a deeper understanding of the policies of the People's Government. In discussing why running a cooperative can increase production, they unanimously mentioned: "The cooperative has many advantages; however, without the government's livestock loans (18 million yuan) and production investment (more than 50 million yuan), we would have many difficulties that we couldn't solve."

    However, if the government wants to stabilize grain prices and commodity prices, guarantee that peasants (and also city dwellers) are not exploited and plundered by profiteers, and guarantee that it can fully supply peasants with grain at reasonable prices when they lack it, or loan it to them, it must have grain in its hands! Thus, the peasants themselves came to the conclusion:

   "We should sell our surplus grain to the state so that the state can have enough grain. We must never let the profiteers take the grain and turn around to oppress us! We must never let grain speculators suck our blood again!"

    The state's policy thus became the peasants' slogan, resounding throughout the village, forming a huge force for action. Before this, their fate was actually linked to the People's state led by the working class, but they had not fully realized this. Now, they are aware of it, and they are actively handing their fate over to their country, and they are using positive actions to support their country. Of the 99 peasant households in this village, 75 have surplus grain, totaling about 60,000 jin. After half a month of preparation and discussion in November, they have now sold more than 50,000 jin to the state in one concentrated effort. They have made a great contribution to the country's construction cause.

    The ideological basis for peasants selling surplus grain to the state is naturally not just passively avoiding the exploitation of profiteers. From the propaganda and discussion of the general line, they already know that the state will realize socialism in the future, realize socialist industrialization and socialist transformation of agriculture; they already know that beyond the happy life of "having land, livestock, and enough to eat and wear," there can be an even happier life - farming with machines, and living with electric lights and telephones. The state wants to control grain precisely in order to have the strength to build industry, so that peasants can live such a happy life in the future. In discussing this beautiful socialist prospect of the state and the people, a kind of enthusiasm for pursuit and progress boiled up among the peasants. The cry of "Take the socialist (road)" resounded everywhere. Young people said:

   "Hurry up and learn culture, so that we can drive tractors in the future!" Old people said: "If we walk faster, we might still catch up!" "It doesn't matter if we can't catch up, as long as the children can catch up. People aren't all doing it for the children, for future generations!" The members of the cooperative said: "We figured out the right path; we've already entered the door." Some who originally wanted to withdraw from the cooperative decided not to withdraw. Those who weren't in the cooperative began to consider joining. Some have already formally submitted applications. The cooperative members, in addition to what they needed for their own consumption, had nearly 30,000 jin of surplus grain (belonging to 34 households), all of which was sold to the state in one go. Deputy Director Li Wenqi's family sold more than 3,000 jin, and cooperative member Chen Fusheng's family sold more than 2,000 jin. After selling the surplus grain, they immediately began to discuss the cooperative's plan for expanded reproduction. They said: "We want to use grain to support national economic construction, we can't let the grain sleep! We also want to use the money we get from selling the grain to expand reproduction, we can't let the money sleep!" When discussing the superior conditions for realizing agricultural mechanization in the village - flat land, close to Beijing, close to the Shuangqiao State Farm, and having agricultural production cooperatives - a smile of satisfaction appeared on everyone's face. They all believed that agricultural mechanization in Sihhezhuang would come relatively quickly.

    决不让粮食投机商再来喝我们的血
    本报记者  林韦
    土地改革的时候，农民都诉说自己受地主剥削的苦。这次讨论国家过渡时期总路线和卖余粮给国家的过程中，我们又看到农民普遍诉说自己受粮食投机商剥削的苦。农民有充分的生活经验使自己认识封建主义是一种深重的灾难，也有充分的生活经验使他们认识资本主义是同样深重的灾难。一切农村工作的同志们应该确信：过去农民能够在反封建的旗帜下自觉地行动起来，现在也能够在反对走资本主义道路的号召下自觉地行动起来，把余粮卖给国家，支援国家经济建设，使国家能顺利达成过渡时期的总任务，实现社会主义。
    这儿举河北通县四合庄村为例。这个村有九十九户农民，他们对于过渡到社会主义的总路线是热烈拥护的。但在最初提出卖余粮给国家的时候，也曾有过不少顾虑。他们不知道国家买了粮食会不会使农民在急需食粮时（如遭了灾）买不到，发生饥荒；或者粮价和物价发生波动，使农民吃亏。经过上级讲解和自己讨论，农民回忆了自己在粮食问题上和人民政府发生过的关系，和粮食投机商发生过的关系。这一回忆，使农民从根本上清醒过来，自觉起来了。在旧社会，农民和粮商发生的关系，比和地主发生的关系更频繁，更普遍。为了买穿的，买用的，偿还债务和各种花费，几乎所有的农民都要卖粮食。而卖粮食的过程，也正是粮商掠夺农民的过程。许多农民回忆说：秋收一下来，农民都急着卖粮用钱。车拉的、驴驮的、肩挑的，好容易把粮食弄到通县城。可是粮商一看农民都急着卖，就把两手一袖，头一歪，硬说粮食现在没销路，不值钱，故意假装不买。农民没办法，只好央求他们。然后他们就像“行善”似的，以相当原价四分之三、三分之二、甚至二分之一的低价把粮食买去。明明昨天粮价还是十二万元，今天一下就落到十万、八万、七万元。农民谈起这些，就形成自然的诉苦：“那时节，真是天罗地网，逃也逃不掉，避也避不开。明知人家在喝咱的血，可是急着用钱，有什么法子！不在通县卖，弄到北京也是一样。今天不卖，明天也许更不值钱。上一次市，人要吃，牲口要喂，盘缠也贴不起啊！”“奸商们不只是在价钱上坑咱，斗上也还要坑咱！带一石粮食进城，害怕不够斗，事先就添了几大把；可是叫奸商们一过斗，准得差好几升。这个抓一把搓搓，那个捧一把看看，在咱家像宝贝似的，到人家手里就像粪土一样，撒得满地都是粮食！咱心疼，人家可高兴，人家有专人拿扫把扫土粮。”“卖了粮食去买东西的时候，又反过来了。商人们说：‘布现在缺得很，贵贱买不到。’明明是一万元的布，咱一去就成了一万二，一万三。买煤油也是一样。”“过了年，青黄不接的时候，许多农民缺粮食，又要去市场买。可是，昨天十二万就能买到，今天十三万、十四万也不一定买得到了。”“天旱了，雨涝了，眼看要遭灾了，这时节，粮价不是一成两成的涨，而是一倍两倍的涨了。农民用自己血汗生产的粮食，落在奸商手里，现在就要反过来制农民的死命了。”许多农民还举了今年秋买麦种问题为例。眼看要种麦了，好些人家要买麦种。政府拨麦种迟了一步，奸商们就把夏天两万多元一斗从农民手里买的小麦，一下提到四万多元一斗。诉说的人说：“要不是政府后来赶快拨麦种来，麦价不但平不下来，而且还得涨。不知道会坑咱多少钱！有的人家已经跟粮商说好四万多元买了一斗，去拿时，粮商又不卖了。”
    谈到农民缺粮时的情形，农民张树轩叙述了自己的遭遇。他家本来有十六亩地，一九四六年春间没粮食吃，也没钱买，向粮商借了五石粮，一石粮利钱四斗，到秋后连本带利该还七石。还不起，只付了两石利息。第二年春天粮食不够吃，又借了三石，一共欠八石。到秋后该还十一石多。逼的不行，咬咬牙卖了五亩地。卖下粮食还没进家，就还人还完了。下一年还是没吃的，国民党又加了税。没办法，又卖了六亩。“眼看活不下去了，”他激昂地说，“谢天谢地，共产党来了！解放了！要不是毛主席，共产党，我连骨头也给奸商们吸干了！”
    许多农民证明：那时候粮商们用粮食高利贷把农民榨得一年赶不上一年，卖房卖地、以至倾家荡产、出去当雇工、卖苦力的，多得很，只是没有统计罢了。粮食利息，四斗并不算最高，还有四斗半、五斗的。
    农民现在还不完全明白“资本主义”是什么意思；但是他们已经懂得：如果让奸商把粮食市场和其他市场完全操纵起来，掌握起来，会给农民带来多么深的痛苦和灾难。
    谈过去，自然也就联系到现在，联系到人民政府。四合庄的农民都记得：一九四九年遭了灾，一九五○年春荒，许多人家缺吃的。但是，专门“趁农民之危”来发横财的粮商这回没有能伸展他们的血手，人民政府的无利贷粮拨来二万八千斤，一户几乎可以平均吃到两石。和粮商的四成利息相比，光这一笔贷粮，农民就省了一万一千二百斤利息。而且自那年起，粮商就再也不能操纵粮价了，其他物价也平稳了，农民再不会被奸商左一刀，右一刀的剐，反一层，正一层的剥了。
    四合庄农民有五十八户是农业生产合作社的社员。这些社员们对人民政府的政策了解得更深。他们在讨论办社为什么能增产时一致提到：“合作社有许多优越性；但是，如果没有政府的牲口贷款（一千八百万元）和生产投资（五千多万元），我们就有许多困难没法解决。”
    可是，政府要平稳粮价和物价，保证农民（也保证市民）不受奸商的剥削和掠夺，保证能在农民缺粮时以合理的价钱充分供应农民，或贷给农民，它必须手里有粮啊！于是农民自己得出了结论：
  “应该把余粮卖给国家，让国家掌握足够的粮食。绝对不能再让奸商把粮食拿去，反过来整我们！决不能让粮食投机商再来喝我们的血！”
    国家的政策，就这样变成了农民的口号，在村里喊得震天响，形成了一种巨大的行动力量。这以前，他们的命运实际上已经和工人阶级领导的人民的国家联结在一起，但他们还没有完全自觉到这一点。现在，他们自觉起来了，他们主动地要把自己的命运交给自己的国家，要用积极的行动来支援自己的国家了。这个村的九十九户农民中，七十五户有余粮，共约六万斤。经过十一月下半月的酝酿、讨论，现在把五万多斤集中地一次卖给了国家。他们对国家的建设事业作了巨大的贡献。
    农民卖余粮给国家的思想基础，自然并不只是消极地避免奸商的剥削。从总路线的宣传和讨论中，他们已经知道国家将来要实现社会主义，实现社会主义工业化和农业的社会主义改造；已经知道在“有土地、有牲口、吃饱穿暖”的幸福生活之外，还可以有更幸福的生活——机器种地，电灯电话过日子。国家要掌握粮食，也正是为了有力量去建设工业，使农民将来都过这样的幸福生活。在讨论国家和人民的这种美丽的社会主义前景时，农民中沸腾起一种追求和前进的狂热。“走社会主义（道路）”的喊声到处响起来。年轻人说：
  “赶快学文化，将来开拖拉机！”老年人说：“走得快一点，咱们也还赶得上！”“赶不上也不要紧，孩子们能赶上就行了。人们还不都是为了孩子，为了后代！”合作社的社员们说：“咱算走对了，咱已经入了门了。”原来有个别想退社的，不退了。不在社的，开始考虑自己也要入社。有的已经正式提出申请。社员们除了自吃，有将近三万斤余粮（属于三十四户），统统一次卖给了国家。副社长李文奇一户卖出三千多斤，社员陈富生一户卖出两千多斤。卖出余粮，他们马上就开始讨论合作社扩大再生产的计划了。他们说：“我们要用粮食支援国家经济建设，不能让粮食睡觉！我们也要用卖得的钱扩大再生产，不能让钱睡觉！”讨论到本村实现农业机械化的优越条件——平原地，靠近北京，靠近双桥国营农场，有了农业生产合作社——这时候每一个人的脸上都浮起了欣慰的笑。他们都认为四合庄的农业机械化会来得比较快些。
