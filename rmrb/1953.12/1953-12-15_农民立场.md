    "Peasant Standpoint"
    Ma Tieding
    A certain argument is circulating among a small number of rural cadres. It is: To do rural work, one must stand on the peasant's standpoint; if one does not firmly stand on the peasant's standpoint, one will harm the peasants' interests.

    This argument is truly muddle-headed. It reminds me of a story: A person who was accustomed to living on land went to the seaside to become a fisherman for the first time, and was immediately intoxicated by the scenery of the sea, so he began to gesticulate and dance; but the sea is not land, and when he frantically jumped out of the boat, he was swallowed by the waves of the sea. This can be said to be a tragedy of mistaking the ocean for land. The aforementioned argument is a re-enactment of this tragedy.

    Our rural work cadres represent the state in leading the peasants. And our state is a state led by the working class. Therefore, rural work cadres must stand on the standpoint of the working class. However, unfortunately: these few people, moving back and forth in the countryside, have already been swallowed by the ocean of peasant small producers—they want to stand on the peasant's standpoint.

    What is the peasant standpoint? The small-scale peasant economy represented by the peasants is an economy standing at the crossroads between socialism and capitalism; it can be guided by the working class to move towards socialism, and at the same time spontaneously tends towards capitalism. Therefore, it can be said that the peasant's standpoint is such a crossroads. If our rural workers forget the standpoint of the working class, the result can only be to spontaneously throw themselves into the embrace of capitalism along with the peasants, and then even the little "peasant standpoint" that they love will vanish.

    The emergence of this muddled concept is not accidental. Many of our rural work cadres are from peasant backgrounds, and at the same time are surrounded by the ocean of the small-scale peasant economy, so it is inevitable that they will be infected to varying degrees by the influence of peasant thinking. Among these, the most tempting thing is the so-called interests of the peasants. Our cadres are generally extremely concerned about the interests of the peasants, which is of course very good. However, some comrades do not understand that the peasants themselves often find it most difficult to see clearly where their true interests lie. Hoarding some surplus grain on hand, waiting for a high price to sell, they think they have made a fragrant profit, but in fact it only facilitates the speculation of merchants, harms the cause of industrialization and socialism, and the country suffers losses, and they themselves lose a lot. Therefore, if our cadres also look at and calculate their so-called interests like many peasants, and so "firmly stand on the peasant's standpoint," then it is truly and thoroughly "harming the interests of the peasants." The greatest interest of the peasants is nothing else but the country's socialist industrialization, which is socialism. As for the peasants' immediate and local interests, of course, they must also be taken care of, but the premise is to link it with this greatest interest. If you deviate from this premise, then there is no question of the peasants' true interests. This is the correct attitude towards the peasants' interests, and only by standing on the standpoint of the working class can you see it clearly.

### “农民立场”

    “农民立场”
    马铁丁
    有一种议论在少数的农村干部中流行着。那就是：做农村工作，就要站在农民的立场上，不站稳农民的立场，就会损害农民的利益。
    这种议论真是糊涂得可以。这使我想起一段故事：有一个在陆地生活惯了的人，初次到海滨当渔夫，立刻就为海的景色所陶醉，于是手舞足蹈起来；但海并不是陆地，当他狂乱地跳出小船，便被海的浪涛一口吞没了。这，可说是误海洋为陆地的一个悲剧。前面说的议论，就是这个悲剧的重演。
    我们的农村工作干部，是代表国家来领导农民的。而我们的国家是工人阶级领导的国家。所以，农村工作干部必须站在工人阶级的立场上。然而，不幸的是：这少数人在农村中串来串去，原来已经被农民小生产者的海洋吞没了——他们要站到农民的立场上去。
    什么是农民立场呢？农民所代表的小农经济是站在社会主义与资本主义之间的十字路口的经济，它既可在工人阶级的引导下走向社会主义，而同时又自发地倾向于资本主义。所以，可以说，农民的立场就是这样的十字路口。我们的农村工作者如果忘掉了工人阶级的立场，结果只能是跟着农民一起自发地投入资本主义的怀抱，于是，连自己所喜爱的那点“农民立场”也一起化为乌有了。
    这种糊涂观念的产生并不是偶然的。我们的农村工作干部，有许多就是农民出身，同时又处于小农经济的海洋的包围之中，这就不免要沾染上不同程度的农民思想影响。在这当中，最诱惑人的东西，就是所谓农民的利益。我们的干部一般都是极其关心农民利益的，这当然很好。然而，有些同志不懂得，正是农民自己往往最不容易看清自己的真正利益之所在，手边囤点余粮，待价而沽，就以为是赚了香盈，其实却只是便利了商人的投机，使工业化的事业和社会主义受了损失，国家吃了亏，自己也蚀了大本。所以，如果我们的干部也像许多农民那样看待和计算自己的所谓利益，那样“站稳农民的立场”，才真的是彻头彻尾地“损害了农民的利益”。农民的最大利益，不是别的，乃是国家的社会主义工业化、乃是社会主义。至于农民的眼前的和局部的利益当然也要照顾，但它的前提是与这个最大的利益联系起来，如果离开这前提，那就说不上什么农民的真正利益了。这才是正确地对待农民利益的态度，而这，只有站在工人阶级的立场上，才能看得清楚。
