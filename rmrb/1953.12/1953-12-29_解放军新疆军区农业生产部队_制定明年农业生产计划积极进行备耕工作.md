Xinhua News Agency Report: The Agricultural Production Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Xinjiang Military Region has formulated an agricultural production and construction plan for 1954. Currently, the production corps is actively engaged in preparatory work for cultivation.

The PLA Xinjiang Military Region Agricultural Production Corps plans to cultivate more than 823,000 mu of farmland in 1954. It will continue to vigorously study and adopt advanced Soviet farming techniques, expand the area of grass-crop rotation in a planned manner, select improved varieties of wheat and cotton, adopt furrow irrigation, prepare and apply granular fertilizers, etc., striving for large-scale bumper harvests of various crops. The unit area yield of winter wheat is to be increased by 32 percent compared to 1953, seed cotton by 39 percent, and oil crops, miscellaneous grains, and beans are also to be increased by more than 20 percent. In 1954, agricultural production will further strengthen planned management and gradually implement an economic accounting system to give full play to the superiority of collective labor within the corps. In terms of basic construction, conditions will be further created to realize comprehensive tractor cultivation, appropriately construct houses, warehouses, and build roads, etc. According to the plan, in 1954 there will be eight mechanized farms, with mechanized cultivation accounting for more than 33 percent of the total cultivated area; the work efficiency of tractors and combine harvesters will be greatly improved; and a large number of cadres and various technical personnel for managing production will be trained.

In order to strive for large-scale bumper harvests of various crops next year, various units seized the time before the freeze to repair canals and carry out winter irrigation. The newly built Xinsheng Canal by a certain unit on the banks of the Manas River will enable the canal water to increase the irrigated area by 30,000 mu. More than 180,000 meters of canals renovated by a certain unit in conjunction with land leveling have canal bodies higher than the ground, making irrigation very convenient, and the fields are square, making them suitable for mechanized farming. The preparatory work done by the production corps in the Manas River Basin before the freeze can save more than 100,000 labor days for next year's spring plowing. Various units have also launched a fertilizer accumulation campaign. Members of the manure collection teams of the company appear in the fields and on roads everywhere before dawn. Stables and toilets have been dug out and universally lined. Everyone also picks up animal bones and uses weeds and leaves to ferment fertilizer. Feeders add grass feed on time day and night, and everyone strives to feed the horses fat and strong. All mechanized farms generally carry out tractor maintenance, parts replacement, and cleaning and maintenance work. In order to strive for an average yield of 420 jin per mu on 10,000 mu of winter wheat next year, soldiers of a certain unit braved the cold wind to pile up the collected weeds and red willow branches on the ridges and canal banks as windbreaks, and stored thick snow in the wheat fields. In the preparatory work, various units attach particular importance to the training of various technical personnel. Many units have set up training classes to learn about the cultivation methods of various crops. In order to gradually implement the economic accounting system, the troops stationed in the Manas River Basin also set up an accounting training class. In the winter education work of various troops, production knowledge education has become a major component.

    制定明年农业生产计划积极进行备耕工作
    据新华社讯：中国人民解放军新疆军区农业生产部队制定出一九五四年的农业生产建设计划。目前，生产部队正积极进行备耕工作。
    新疆军区农业生产部队一九五四年计划耕种八十二万三千多亩农田。继续大力学习和采用苏联的先进耕作技术，有计划地扩大草田轮作面积，选用麦、棉良种，采用沟灌，配制和施用颗粒肥料等，争取各种作物大面积丰收。冬麦单位面积产量要比一九五三年提高百分之三十二，籽棉提高百分之三十九，油料作物、杂粮和豆类也都要提高百分之二十以上。一九五四年在农业生产上将进一步加强计划管理和逐步推行经济核算制，以充分发挥部队集体劳动的优越性。在基本建设上，要进一步为实现全面的拖拉机耕作创造条件，适当地修建房屋、仓库和修筑道路等。按照计划，一九五四年将有八个机耕农场，机耕面积要占到全部耕地面积的百分之三十三强；拖拉机、康拜因的工作效率要大大提高；同时大量培养管理生产的干部和各种技术人材。
    为了争取明年各种作物大面积丰收，各部在封冻前就抓紧整修渠道进行了冬灌。某部在玛纳斯河畔整修的新盛渠，使渠水可增加灌溉面积三万亩。某部结合平整土地整修的十八万多公尺渠道，渠身比地面高，浇水很方便，同时田块方正，便于机耕。玛纳斯河流域的生产部队在封冻前做的备耕工作，约可为明年春耕生产节省十万个以上的劳动日。各部还掀起了积肥运动。连队拾粪组组员天不明就出现在野外和四处道路上。马厩、厕所都经过掏挖，普遍垫圈。大家并捡兽骨和利用杂草、树叶沤制肥料。饲养员日夜准时添着草料，大家都争取把马匹喂得膘满力壮。各机耕农场普遍进行拖拉机检修、配件和清洁护养工作。某部为争取明年的一万亩冬麦平均每亩收获四百二十斤，战士们冒着寒风，把采集的杂草和红柳条堆积在田埂和渠边上，作为防风屏障，并在麦田里储存了厚厚的雪。各部在备耕工作中，特别重视培养各种技术人员。许多单位办了训练班，学习各种作物的栽培方法。为了逐步推行经济核算制，驻在玛纳斯河流域的部队还办了会计训练班。在各部队冬季教育工作中，生产知识教育已成为一项主要内容。
