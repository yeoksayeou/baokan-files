Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 8th: The Chinese People's Volunteer Army leadership issued a decision on December 5th, posthumously awarding the internationalist fighter Shi Yuanhou, a martyr of the Luo Shengjiao type from a certain railway corps of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the title of First-Class Merit Citation and the honorary title of Second-Class Model of Cherishing the People. The Chinese Communist Party Committee of a certain railway corps of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, according to the martyr's wishes during his lifetime, posthumously admitted Shi Yuanhou as a member of the Chinese Communist Party and approved his posthumous recognition as a model member of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. The Headquarters and Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army also sent a telegram to the family of Martyr Shi Yuanhou on the 7th, expressing deep condolences for the sacrifice of Martyr Shi Yuanhou.

Martyr Shi Yuanhou was a soldier of the Guard Company of a certain railway corps of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, from Panjiazhuang, Seventh District, Changqing County, Shandong Province, and a member of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. On December 1st, Shi Yuanhou was ordered to escort representatives of the Eighth Sub-delegation of the Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea to a certain unit. While returning to his original unit after completing his mission, he passed a small bridge near Anzhou Railway Station. Several Korean children were skating under the bridge when the ice suddenly broke, and one child fell into the ice hole. Shi Yuanhou immediately took off his cotton coat and jumped into the ice water, which was more than ten feet deep, to rescue the child. Because the ice was thin and the water was cold, he plunged into the deep water three times before lifting the child onto the ice. However, because he had been immersed in the ice water for too long, his whole body was frozen, and he was unable to escape danger at the same time. Zhang Hongjin, a soldier traveling with him, immediately jumped into the water to rescue him, but failed to find him after three attempts. When other Volunteer Army soldiers and members of the慰问团(consolation group) who had rushed from nearby broke the ice with wooden sticks to rescue Shi Yuanhou, it was too late, and Shi Yuanhou had gloriously sacrificed himself.

    志愿军战士史元厚舍身抢救朝鲜儿童
    志愿军领导机关追认烈士为一等功臣
    【新华社平壤八日电】中国人民志愿军领导机关于十二月五日发布决定，追认志愿军铁道兵某部罗盛教式的国际主义战士史元厚烈士为一等功臣，并授予二级爱民模范的光荣称号。中国共产党中国人民志愿军铁道兵某部委员会根据烈士生前意愿，追认史元厚烈士为中国共产党党员，并批准追认他为中国新民主主义青年团模范团员。中国人民志愿军司令部、政治部并于七日打电报给史元厚烈士的家属，对史元厚烈士的牺牲表示沉痛的悼念。
    史元厚烈士是中国人民志愿军铁道兵某部警卫连战士，山东省长清县第七区潘家庄人，中国新民主主义青年团团员。十二月一日，史元厚奉命护送中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团第八总分团的代表去某部。他在完成任务返回原部队时，经过安州火车站附近的一座小桥，桥下正有几个朝鲜儿童在滑冰，这时突然冰面破裂，有一个儿童陷入冰窟中。史元厚立即脱去棉衣，跳入一丈多深的冰水中抢救。因冰薄水冷，他连续三次钻入深水才将儿童托上冰面，而自己则因浸在冰水中过久，全身冻僵，未能同时脱险，与他同行的战士张洪津随即入水抢救，但连续三次均未找到。待由附近赶来的其他志愿军战士和慰问团人员用木棍敲破冰面救出史元厚时，因时间过久，史元厚已光荣牺牲。
