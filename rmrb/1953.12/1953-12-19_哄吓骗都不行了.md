Coaxing, Intimidation, and Deception No Longer Work
　　
　　American tycoons, playing around on the international political stage, use no more than three tricks: coaxing, intimidation, and deception. The "Marshall Plan" is a typical example of "coaxing"; the "atomic bomb policy" is a prime example of "intimidation"; and "humanitarian treatment" and the like are Western-style magic tricks of "deception." Holding gold dollars in one hand, brandishing atomic bombs in the other, and spewing white foam while shouting about "humanitarian treatment": this is the stage image of the "most powerful" imperialism!

　　However, tricks are tricks after all, and once exposed, they reveal their true colors. Everyone remembers that when the "atomic bomb policy" first appeared, the White House officials who controlled this "policy" were themselves so frightened that they trembled all over. Some dug bomb shelters, and others "discovered" "mysterious flying saucers" from "somewhere" (of course, even more terrifying than atomic bombs), causing a great commotion. Secretary of Defense Forrestal at one moment wanted to drive American tanks into the streets of the Soviet Union, and the next moment he hallucinated American fire trucks speeding through the streets of America as Soviet tanks. He was so frightened that he went insane and jumped to his death. How small is the soul of a war hysteria patient!

　　However, small as it may be, a tense situation still had to be created; otherwise, the profits of the arms dealers would be unreliable. Without "troubled waters," where would one "fish"? So, even though they suffered heavy losses on the Korean battlefield, became universally opposed, and had no choice but to sign an armistice, they still frantically created a tense situation. The "Bermuda Conference" had been held, and the "Five-Power Proposal" had been passed by the United Nations' puppet "majority" voting machine. While the American negotiating representative Dean put forward a threatening "final proposal," Eisenhower, carrying "hope and sincerity," rushed from Bermuda to the United Nations General Assembly in New York to boast about America's "atomic bomb superiority." Immediately following Eisenhower's boasting, Mr. Dean played the farce of "fleeing the meeting" in Panmunjom, causing the world-瞩目ed bilateral talks to be interrupted. The trick of creating a tense situation is being played with increasing vigor, but in the final analysis, it's still those few tricks: coaxing, intimidation, and deception!

　　Old tricks will never achieve any new results. The American "Five-Power Proposal" was given a resounding slap in the face by the blood-written facts exposed by the Chinese Red Cross Society. The deception of the communiqué boasting about the "achievements" of the Bermuda Conference was also exposed by their own "mouthpiece": the conference brought "disappointment" to "all parties." As for the "power of the atomic bomb," according to Eisenhower himself, it is no longer "exclusively possessed" by the United States. So, what about germ warfare? It was done a long time ago, and the result was that they still had to "sit down and talk"! After "sitting down and talking," they then created excuses for no reason and suddenly "fled the meeting." What else does that show besides once again expressing their "sincerity" in fearing peace? They can "flee" the meeting, but can they "flee" the responsibility for sabotaging political conferences?

　　Asia has changed, the world has changed. The people's "hope and sincerity" are so clear that no tricks or atrocities can stop the wheels of history. This is precisely the so-called "lesson of facts"!

　　If you really want to solve the problem, then honestly sit down and talk. The tricks of coaxing, intimidation, and deception should have been put to rest long ago.

    哄吓骗都不行了
    丁三
    美国大亨们在国际政治舞台上玩来玩去，不外三套把戏：哄、吓、骗。“马歇尔计划”是“哄”的典型；“原子弹政策”是“吓”的标本；而“人道待遇”之类，则是“骗”的西洋景。一手握着金洋钱，一手舞着原子弹，口喷白沫，叫嚣“人道待遇”：这就是“最强大的”帝国主义的舞台形象！
    然而把戏到底是把戏，一被拆穿，便原形毕露了。大家记得：“原子弹政策”刚出场，掌握这一“政策”的白宫老爷们自己先吓得浑身发抖，有的挖防空洞，有的“发现”来自“某方”的“神秘的飞碟”（当然比原子弹更可怕），闹得满城风雨。国防部长福莱斯特尔一会儿要把美国的坦克开进苏联的街道，一会儿又把美国的救火车幻想作苏联的坦克在美国街头疾驰了，吓得他发了神经病，跳楼自杀了。战争歇斯底里病患者的灵魂是何等渺小！
    然而渺小尽管渺小，紧张局势还是不得不制造的，否则军火老板们的利润便靠不住了。没有“混水”，到哪儿去“摸鱼”？所以他们即使在朝鲜战场上碰得头破血流、众叛亲离、不得不签字停战了。以后，还在七手八脚、七嘴八舌地制造着紧张局势。“百慕大会议”开过了，“五国提案”被联合国的御用“多数”表决机通过了，而在美方谈判代表迪安提出恫吓性的“最后建议”的同时，艾森豪威尔又带着“希望和诚意”，从百慕匆匆赶到纽约联合国大会，吹嘘美国“原子弹的优势”。紧接着艾森豪威尔的吹嘘，迪安先生又在板门店扮演起“逃会”的丑剧来了，使举世瞩目的双方会谈陷于中断。制造紧张局势的把戏越耍越起劲，但归根结柢，还是那几套：哄、吓、骗！
    老手法决不会取得什么新效果。美方的“五国提案”，被中国红十字会所揭发的血写的事实打了一个响亮的耳光；吹嘘百慕大会议的“收获”的公报的骗局，也被他们自己的“喉舌”拆穿了：会议给“所有方面”带来了“失望”。而“原子弹的威力”呢，据艾森豪威尔自己说，又不是美国“单独掌握的”了。那么，细菌战呢？早已干过了，结果还是不得不“坐下来谈”！“坐下来谈”之后又无故制造藉口，突然“逃会”，那除了又一次表示自己害怕和平的“诚意”外，还有什么呢？会可以“逃”，破坏政治会议的责任“逃”得了吗？
    亚洲变了，世界变了。人民的“希望和诚意”是那样地明白，任何把戏和暴行都拉不住历史的车轮。这正是所谓“事实的教训”！
    如果真想解决问题，还是老老实实坐下来谈吧。哄吓骗的把戏早该休息了。
