State-Owned Department Stores in Northeast China
Supply Farmers with Large Quantities of Production and Living Materials
Actively Preparing Large Quantities of New Year Goods to Ensure Supply of Goods for New Year and Spring Festival

State-owned department stores in Northeast China are supplying farmers with large quantities of industrial products through cooperatives and retail stores to meet their material needs after selling grain. At the same time, they are actively preparing for the supply of New Year's goods for the New Year and Spring Festival.

Since the sale of commodity grain this year is concentrated, the sales period is shortened, and the supply is also large, state-owned department stores in various places have generally attached importance to and played the role of assistant to cooperatives. The plans of many city and county department stores are not commensurate with the expanded supply and new markets. Various department store wholesale stations are actively allocating the large inventories reserved in the third quarter to city and county department stores.

After the new grain began to be marketed, the sales volume in grain-producing areas increased sharply. Wholesale stations of department stores in Heilongjiang Province have allocated several hundred billion yuan worth of industrial products to city and county department stores. City and county department stores have expanded their supply to rural supply and marketing cooperatives, so farmers have bought more and more things from state-owned retail stores and cooperatives. In early November, department stores in cities and counties of Heilongjiang sold 500 tons of cotton wadding, which increased to 580 tons in late November; 144,000 bolts of cotton cloth were sold in early November, which increased to 175,000 bolts in mid-November; and more than 12,000 pairs of cotton galoshes were added. Among them, six-tenths were supplied through cooperatives. In the ten days of late November, state-owned department stores in Heilongjiang Province sold 123 billion yuan worth of goods. By the end of November, Songjiang Province's department stores had sold 520,000 bolts of cotton cloth and 260 billion yuan worth of daily necessities. Department stores in Liaoxi Province sold a total value of 370 billion yuan of cloth and general merchandise.

In addition to purchasing consumer goods, farmers also purchased means of production. In Heilongjiang Province, farmers have bought more than 2,300 rubber tires from state-owned department stores, which can be used to assemble more than 1,000 new rubber-wheeled carts. In October and November, 2.54 million sacks were sold throughout the region.

At present, the market volume of commodity grain is increasing, and the New Year and Spring Festival are approaching. According to custom, urban and rural people will purchase large quantities of New Year goods and general daily necessities. To this end, department store wholesale stations in various regions are actively allocating goods on the one hand, and actively organizing sources of New Year goods on the other. The largest wholesale station in Northeast China, Shenyang Wholesale Station, has ordered 140 billion yuan of New Year goods, prepared four train cars of red paper, nearly three million packages of candles and more than 200,000 New Year pictures locally, as well as a large number of food, women's and children's products, totaling more than 350 kinds. The Harbin Wholesale Station plans to allocate 100 billion yuan worth of New Year goods, and the Jinzhou, Siping and other wholesale stations have begun to distribute New Year goods to city and county department stores one after another.

    东北各地国营百货公司
    大量供应农民生产和生活的资料
    现正筹备大批年货保证新年和春节物资供应
    东北各地国营百货公司正通过合作社和零售商店将大批工业品供给农民，满足农民卖粮后的物资需要。同时积极筹备新年和春节的年货供应。
    由于今年各地商品粮销售集中，销售时间缩短，供应量也较大，因而各地国营百货公司普遍地重视和发挥了合作社的助手作用。不少市、县百货公司的计划在扩大供应后和新的市场不相称，各地百货批发站正积极地将第三季度储备的大库存，向各市县百货公司分拨。
    新粮开始上市之后，产粮区销货额激增。黑龙江省内各百货批发站已将数千亿元的工业品下拨到各市县百货公司，市县百货公司都扩大了对农村供销合作社的供应，因而农民们从国营零售商店和合作社买回去的东西就越来越多了。黑龙江各市县百货公司十一月上旬卖了五百吨絮花，下旬增加到五百八十吨；上旬卖了棉布十四万四千匹，中旬就增为十七万五千匹；棉胶鞋增加了一万二千多双。其中有十分之六是经过合作社供应的。在十一月下旬的十天中，黑龙江省国营百货公司销售的商品就达一千二百三十亿元。松江省百货公司到十一月末就已经销出了五十二万匹棉布和价值两千六百多亿元的日用百货商品。辽西省百货公司销出了布匹百货总值达三千七百亿元。
    农民们除了购置生活消费品外，还购置了生产资料。在黑龙江省，农民们已从国营百货公司买回去胶皮轮胎两千三百多条，这就能够拴起一千多辆新的胶轮大车来。十、十一月两个月中全区销出的麻袋已达二百五十四万条。
    目前，各地商品粮的上市量正在增加，新年和春节即将到来，按照习惯，城乡人民将购进大批年货和一般日用品。为此，各地区百货批发站正一面积极下拨商品，一面积极组织年货的货源。东北区内最大的沈阳批发站，已经订了一千四百亿元的年货计划，在当地加工备妥了四火车皮红纸、近三百万包蜡烛和二十多万张年画，以及大批食品、妇女儿童用品等共达三百五十多种。哈尔滨批发站计划下拨价值一千亿元的年货，锦州、四平等批发站已经开始陆续向各市县百货公司分拨年货。（李继尧）
