Deepening the movement to increase production and practice economy, the broad masses of workers in Shenyang are creating more and more mechanized and semi-mechanized devices. Shenyang Wire Factory learned from the experience of Anshan Iron and Steel's small rolling mill. After creating mechanized devices such as the forward and reverse enclosing disks for large and small rolling mills, "double-pipe discharge," and "flipping guide plates," they recently succeeded in researching vertical enclosing disks and electromagnetic brakes. Since the operators of the roughing mill started using vertical enclosing disks, they can produce more than ten tons of square steel per shift per day, greatly reducing physical labor and ensuring safe production. The electromagnetic brake is an automatic device installed on the operating table of the flipping guide plate. With it, the material can be controlled with the press of a button. In addition, the factory workers have proposed 31 major suggestions for improving the automatic track of the large furnace and automatic discharge devices. Since Xu Zhengfu of the Shenyang Transformer Factory created the cold-pressing enclosing tube machine, veteran worker Chen Enli has created the automatic gasifier and automatic water feeder (saving 1,000 kilograms of gas per month). Veteran workers Yin Wanli, Li Guichun, and Dong Jingchun created the automatic overturning machine (saving one crane), and veteran worker Gao Yongxiang created the automatic tool for radiators, which greatly improved production efficiency. Young carpenters at the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Factory successfully researched a circular saw machine, so that packaging workers no longer have to saw wood by hand. Its efficiency when cutting square materials has increased by 76 percent, and when cutting boards it has increased by 53 percent. Zhou Jianchang, foreman of the foundry workshop of the Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory, successfully researched the electric shaking machine, increasing efficiency eleven times. The produced flake lead powder (used for brushing mold cores) is fine and high-quality, reducing the rejection rate of the factory's production of a certain steel ingot mold from 60 to 70 percent to 20 percent. Yan Wentang, a worker at the Shenyang Waterworks, along with Liu Yong'an, Lin Changqing, and others, improved the caisson device and implemented a semi-automated sliding car gravity-supporting caisson method. The fixed quota of thirteen people was reduced to four, and the original caisson device was accelerated from grabbing soil once every three or four minutes to once every one minute and twenty seconds, creating important conditions for the factory to complete its annual capital construction tasks. Yu Xiande, a worker at Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory, created a new type of iron tightening tool, improving efficiency by two and a half times. After returning from a visit to Anshan Iron and Steel, veteran worker Yu Shunxing of the same factory researched automatic tool feeding devices on the lying lathe and planer, replacing manual tool feeding, improving the utilization rate of large equipment, and facilitating the implementation of multi-machine operation. Qin Shilu, a worker at the Shenyang Fan Factory, and technicians Wang Zhisheng and worker Yang Zhonghou developed a die for crimping tungsten-gold tiles. Previously, processing a tungsten-gold tile, including crimping and aligning, took more than two hours. Now, it only takes five minutes.

Due to the continuous emergence of mechanization creations, the content of the production increase and economy practice competition has been greatly enriched, and the completion of the production increase and economy practice plan has been powerfully guaranteed. Factories and enterprises such as the Smelting Plant, Wire Factory, Transformer Factory, and Shenyang Electrical Machinery Factory have planned to strengthen the leadership of this work. The Wire Factory organized veteran workers, technicians, management personnel, and Party and mass cadres to visit Anshan twice in October to learn from their experience. After returning, they checked the implementation of Soviet experts' suggestions and studied the direction of the mechanization movement in their factory, deciding to start with the rolling department first. On November 8, the factory held a worker representative meeting to mobilize efforts to transform old equipment around weak links. Then, a symposium of veteran workers and technicians was held to formulate discussion outlines according to the requirements of completing the production plan and balancing production, in order to focus the wisdom and strength of the workers in a targeted manner. In addition, the Rationalization Proposal Committee was re-established, with full-time cadres and full-time technicians responsible for this work, researching and reviewing rationalization proposals, and strengthening technical guidance. Since Xu Zhengfu of the Transformer Factory created the cold-pressing enclosing tube machine, it has attracted the attention of the leadership to mechanization creation. They have successively held symposiums of veteran workers and technical performance meetings to mobilize technical personnel to go to the workshops to assist workers in solving technical problems in creation, and have established advanced experience promotion teams in the workshops. At the same time, they lead the mechanization movement and assign dedicated personnel in each work section to be responsible for review, statistics, and other work. Facts have proved that in units that do so, the mechanization movement is carried out fully. The mass mechanization movement in particular in the Wire Factory has become an important method for them to improve outdated equipment and achieve production increase and economy practice plans.

    开展机械化运动发挥生产潜力
    沈阳广大职工的创造越来越多
    随着增产节约运动的深入发展，沈阳市广大职工的机械化半机械化创造越来越多。沈阳线材厂学习鞍钢小型轧钢厂经验，在创造了大小压延机安装反正围盘、“双管出料”和“翻料导板”等机械化装置之后，最近又研究立围盘、电磁制动器成功，毛轧机工人使用立围盘以来，每日三班可多出方钢十吨以上，而且大大减轻了体力劳动，做到安全生产；电磁制动器是安在翻料导板操作台上的自动装置，有了它，只要一按电钮便可掌握翻料；此外该厂工人还提出了改进大炉自动跑道、出料自动装置等三十一项重大建议，沈阳变压器厂自徐振国创造冷压围管机以后，又出现了老工人陈恩立创造的自动瓦斯器和自动上水器（每月可节省一千斤瓦斯），老工人尹万里、李桂春、董景春创造的自动翻转机（可节省一台吊车），老工人高永祥创造的对散热器自动工具，大大提高了生产效率。沈阳第二机床厂青年木工研究轮锯机成功，使包装工人不必再用手锯拉木料了，用它截方料提高效率百分之七十六，截板材提高效率百分之五十三。沈阳矿山机器厂翻砂车间工长周建昌研究电力逛桶机成功，提高效率十一倍，研出来的磷片铅粉（刷铸型芯子用的）又细又好，使该厂制造某种钢锭模的废品率由百分之六十到七十降低为百分之二十。沈阳市自来水厂工人严文堂与刘永安、林长清等改进沉井装置，实行半自动化的滑车重力支离沉井法，由定额十三人减为四人操作，使原来的沉井装置由三、四分钟抓一次土加快为每一分二十秒抓一次，给该厂完成全年基本建设任务创造了重要条件。沈阳重型机器厂工人于显德创造一种新的拧铁工具，提高效率二倍半，同一工厂老工人于顺兴去鞍钢参观回来后，先后在躺镟和刨床上研究出自动送刀装置，代替手摇送刀，提高了大型设备的运用率，并且便于实行多机床操作。沈阳扇风机厂工人秦世禄和技术员王知声、工人杨忠厚研究出一种掐钨金瓦的胎具，以前加工一个钨金瓦，连掐活带找正需要两个多钟头，现在只要五分钟就干完了。
    由于机械化的创造不断出现，大大丰富了增产节约竞赛的内容，并且有力地保证了增产节约计划的完成。冶炼厂、线材厂、变压器厂、沈阳市电机厂等单位已有计划地加强对这一工作的领导。线材厂十月份曾二次组织老工人、技术人员、管理人员和党群干部到鞍山参观，学习那里的经验，回来后便检查了贯彻苏联专家建议的情况，研究本厂开展机械化运动的方向，确定首先从压延部着手。十一月八日该厂召开职工代表大会，动员围绕薄弱环节改造旧的设备，接着又召开了老工人技术人员座谈会，按照完成生产计划的要求和平衡生产的原则拟定讨论提纲，以便把职工的智慧和力量有重点地集中起来。此外，并重新健全了合理化建议委员会，配备专职干部和专职技术人员负责这一工作，研究与审查合理化建议，加强技术指导。变压器厂自从徐振国创造冷压围管机之后，引起领导方面对机械化创造的注意，先后召开老工人座谈会和技术表演会，动员技术人员下车间协助工人解决创造上的技术问题，并在车间里设立了先进经验推广组，同时领导机械化运动，并在每个工段设立专人，负责审查、统计等工作。事实证明，凡是这样做的单位，机械化运动就开展得饱满，特别是线材厂，群众性的机械化运动已成为他们改进陈旧设备，实现增产节约计划的重要方法。       （张兆福  张作舟等）
