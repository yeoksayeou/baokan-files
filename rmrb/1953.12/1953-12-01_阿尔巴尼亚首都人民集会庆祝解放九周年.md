Xinhua News Agency, December 30th: TASS reports: On November 28th, on the eve of the ninth anniversary of the liberation of Albania, the people of Tirana, the capital of Albania, held a celebration meeting at the People's Theater. The meeting was attended by Albanian Labor Party and government leaders Hoxha, Leshi, Shehu, Kabo, Nushi, Baluku, Koleka, Soviet Embassy in Albania Chargé d'Affaires Kabanov, as well as People's Army generals, People's Heroes, and advanced producers.

The meeting was opened and presided over by Shehu. Kabo delivered a report on the ninth anniversary of Albania's liberation.

In his report, Kabo listed many facts to illustrate the achievements made by the Albanian people in the past nine years. He said: This year, Albania's total industrial output is eight times that of 1938. The production volume of the food industry in 1952 was ten times that of 1938. The national mineral production has now increased to four and a half times that of the pre-war period; the proportion of industrial production in the total output value of the national economy is 59.6%, while agriculture accounts for 40.4%. This year's cultivated land area has increased by 64% compared to 1938, and the cultivated area of industrial crops has increased by 12.4 times. In 1953, farmers received more than ten times the agricultural loans they received in 1947, and the degree of agricultural mechanization increased fourfold compared to 1946. From 1951 to 1953, the average annual increase in commodity circulation was 2.3 times that of 1938. In addition to industrial buildings, a total of 339,000 square meters of housing with a total value of 1.375 billion leks (Albanian currency) has been built from 1947 to the present. The housing to be built for the working people this year will be twice that of 1949-1950. In terms of education, the number of schools at all levels in Albania has increased threefold compared to 1939. Before the war, Albania had only seventeen cinemas, but now there are one hundred and nine. Before the war, Albania only had eight hospitals and forty-six clinics, but now it has forty-nine hospitals and four hundred and forty-one clinics. In the past nine years, the welfare of the working people has greatly improved. Compared with 1948, the consumption of sugar in 1952 increased by 2.4 times, pasta increased by 3.5 times, fish and meat increased by about 2 times, and kidney beans and rice almost increased by 6 times.

Kabo pointed out that the Labor Party and the government have always pursued a policy of continuously consolidating the national economy and improving the material and cultural standards of the working people. Kabo also talked about the measures the government has taken to further improve people's welfare. He then said that the government plans to greatly increase investment in agriculture in 1954 to accelerate the pace of agricultural development. The Albanian people are full of determination to fight for the defense of peace together with the entire democratic camp.

The celebration meeting finally adopted a telegram of salute to the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

The working people in other cities of Albania also held gatherings to celebrate the ninth anniversary of liberation.

Among those who attended the reception were Soviet First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Foreign Affairs Molotov, as well as heads of various departments of the Soviet government and diplomatic envoys from various countries to the Soviet Union.
