Stalin is the Creator of a Powerful Socialist Industry
Soviet Union Ge. Kosiyachenko
    Our working class, after the victory of the October Socialist Revolution and the establishment of the dictatorship of the working class, politically defeated capitalism. Thus, the task of economically defeating capitalism and establishing a socialist social system was placed before the working class and the Party. Lenin and Stalin discovered and scientifically demonstrated the method for solving this major task, pointing out that the main link in building a socialist economy is the development of heavy industry.
    Under the leadership of the Party, the Soviet people built a socialist society in an extremely short period of time and established a powerful industry—the material foundation for our country's victorious advance on the road to communism.

    Lenin and Stalin scientifically demonstrated the absolute necessity of realizing socialist industrialization in our country.
    The great Lenin pointed out that the only material foundation of socialism is large-scale machine industry, and that the fastest elimination of the long-standing technical and economic backwardness is a matter of life and death for our country.
    Comrade Stalin, based on Lenin's instructions, formulated the principles of socialist industrialization. He pointed out that the essence of industrialization lies in the development of heavy industry and its heart—machine manufacturing. He armed the Party and the Soviet people with a great program for establishing and developing large-scale machine industry; such an industry could lead agriculture and realize the socialist transformation of agriculture.
    Stalin said: "We have already caught up with and surpassed the advanced capitalist countries in building a new political system—the Soviet system. This is very good. But this is not enough. To achieve the final victory of socialism in our country, we must also catch up with and surpass these countries in the economic and technical fields. We either achieve this goal or we fail." (Stalin's Collected Works, Russian edition, Vol. 11, p. 248)
    The internal and external environment of the world's first socialist country development showed that rapid industrialization was necessary. A country of the dictatorship of the working class surrounded by hostile capitalism, without heavy industry and its own machine manufacturing, could not protect and consolidate its economic independence. Comrade Stalin said in his speech on February 9, 1946: "The Party knew that the war was approaching, and that without heavy industry it would be impossible to defend the country, so it was necessary to start developing heavy industry quickly. If this matter was delayed even a little, it would be tantamount to failure. The Party remembered Lenin's instructions: without heavy industry, it would be impossible to maintain the independence of the country; without heavy industry, the Soviet system would perish. Therefore, our Communist Party rejected the 'usual' path of industrialization and started national industrialization from the development of heavy industry."
    The implementation of the policy of socialist industrialization was very difficult, because it could only rely on internal accumulation resources, which required the greatest austerity and the determination to endure temporary sacrifices. The difficulty also lay in the fact that the rapid development of industry required a large number of engineering and technical cadres and economic cadres, and these cadres had to be trained while carrying out new construction.
    Comrade Stalin saw the possibility of overcoming these difficulties and successfully solving the historical task of industrialization of socialist countries in the superiority of the Soviet social system and state system, in the socialist economic system, and in the creative labor and political enthusiasm of the masses.
    Implementing socialist industrialization is in the vital interests of the working class and the peasants.
    Socialist production is different from capitalist production. Its purpose is not to absorb profits, but to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of Soviet society. The establishment and development of heavy industry and its heart—machine manufacturing—is a decisive material prerequisite for technically re-equipping agriculture, light industry, and the food industry and improving them. Only on this basis can the material welfare of the working people continue to grow.
    The Leninist and Stalinist policy of socialist industrialization was realized by the Party in the most acute and uncompromising struggle against the most ferocious enemies of the Party and the Soviet people, the Trotskyites and Bukharinites. These enemies of the people tried their best to undermine industrialization and restore capitalism in our country.
    In implementing Stalin's policy of socialist industrialization, the Soviet people infinitely supported the Party. The creative enthusiasm of the working masses and the extremely widespread development of socialist competition ensured the completion of Stalin's industrialization plan.
    As a result of the implementation of Stalin's policy of national industrialization, the Soviet Union, in an unprecedentedly short period of time, transformed from an industrially backward agricultural country into a powerful industrial country. In the thirteen years from 1928 to 1940, the Soviet Union eliminated its technical and economic backwardness and, as a result, jumped to first place in Europe in terms of total industrial production.
    The industrialization of our country was carried out on a high technical basis and on the basis of electrification. In terms of the new technical equipment of industry and agriculture, the Soviet Union has become the most advanced country in the world.
    Due to the establishment of advanced large-scale industry, it was possible to quickly put agriculture on the socialist track, transform it technically, and greatly increase the productivity of agriculture.
    Comrade Stalin pointed out that such an unprecedented increase in production should not be regarded as the general development of our country from backwardness to progress. "This is a leap, by means of which our motherland has changed from a backward country into an advanced country, from an agricultural country into an industrial country." The main and decisive force determining the tremendous development of national productive forces is the new socialist relations of production.
    The great significance of Stalin's socialist industrialization policy was particularly powerfully manifested during the Great Patriotic War. The far-sighted Stalinist socialist industrialization policy saved our motherland from destruction and from the enslavement of German imperialism.
    Soviet industry continued to develop at a rapid pace in the post-war years. The consequences of the war were eliminated in a short period of time, and industrial production greatly exceeded the pre-war level. During the years of Soviet power, Soviet industrial production increased thirty-nine times. Industrial products produced in 1952 were about 2.3 times that of 1940, of which the production of means of production increased 2.7 times.
    Socialist national industrialization and agricultural collectivization have opened up broad activity space for the basic economic laws of socialism; they have created the possibility for the continuous growth and improvement of all social production on the highest technical basis and on the constantly improving level of people's consumption.
    After building socialism in accordance with Stalin's program, the Soviet people began to build communism. Stalin taught that one of the basic preconditions for preparing the transition to communism is to effectively ensure the continuous growth of all social production, and that the growth of the production of means of production should take priority.
    The instructions of the 19th Party Congress for the Fifth Five-Year Plan for the Development of the Soviet Union from 1951 to 1955 is a great program for the further growth of the Soviet Union's industrial strength. This instruction of the 19th Party Congress was drafted under the direct leadership of the great Stalin.
    The great Stalin's ideas on the conditions for preparing the transition from socialism to communism, on the priority of the growth of the production of means of production, and on the task of socialist production to subordinate itself to the task of maximizing the satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society, are all specifically expressed in the Five-Year Plan.
    The Fifth Five-Year Plan stipulates that industry and all sectors of the national economy should further achieve tremendous upsurges. According to the instructions, the total output value of all industries must increase by about 70% during the five-year period, the production of means of production must increase by 80%, and the production of consumer goods must increase by about 65%.
    In implementing Comrade Stalin's plan, the Party and the government constantly guided socialist industry to develop along the road of technological progress. In the period from 1951 to 1952 alone, the national machine manufacturing industry created about 1,100 kinds of the most important new machines and machinery. The mechanization of strenuous labor has advanced greatly in the post-war years, and electrification has gained further development. Our industry continued to equip agriculture, transportation, and other sectors of the national economy with modern machines on a wide scale.
    Stalin always showed special concern for the full development of heavy industry. He was the initiator of the construction of many such large socialist industrial enterprises as the Magnitogorsk and Kuznetsk Metallurgical Combine, the Stalingrad and Kharkov Tractor Factories, the Moscow and Gorky Automobile Factories, the Ural Heavy Machinery Manufacturing Factory, and the Dnieper Hydroelectric Power Station. According to Stalin's plan, the largest hydropower stations and irrigation systems are being built on the Volga River, the Dnieper River, the Amu Darya River, and other places.
    The experience of socialist industrialization in the Soviet Union is of great international significance. It proves the absolute necessity of socialist industrialization for establishing the material and productive base of socialism; this experience facilitates the development of socialist construction in other countries.
    Comrade Stalin said: "We should do everything possible to make our country an economically independent and self-reliant country relying on the domestic market, and become the center that can attract all other countries that are gradually breaking away from the capitalist system and entering the socialist economic orbit." (Stalin's Collected Works, Russian edition, Vol. 7, p. 299)
    Comrade Stalin's great scientific prediction has been brilliantly realized. The People's Republic of China and the European People's Democratic countries, which have broken away from the capitalist world, have formed a powerful democratic and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and they are carrying out economic mutual assistance and cooperation and successfully building a new life.
    The Soviet Union provides the People's Democratic countries with huge material assistance, supplying them with first-class technical equipment for building factories, and helping them adopt new technologies and master production.
    The Soviet Union's multifaceted assistance enables the People's Democratic countries to build socialist industry at a rapid pace and consolidate the democratic and socialist camp.
    Comrade Stalin, the great leader and teacher of the Party and the Soviet people, taught us to do our utmost to consolidate and develop socialist industry—the unbreakable fortress of the economic and national defense strength of our socialist motherland, and to constantly improve the solid material foundation for the happy life of the Soviet people. Realizing Stalin's legacy is one of the main tasks of the Party and the people.

    斯大林是强大社会主义工业的创建人
    苏联  格·科西雅钦科
    我国工人阶级，在十月社会主义革命胜利及建立了工人阶级专政后，在政治上战胜了资本主义。于是，在工人阶级的面前，在党的面前就提出了在经济上战胜资本主义及建立社会主义社会制度的任务。列宁和斯大林发现了，并科学地论证了解决这一重大任务的方法，他们指出，建设社会主义经济的主要环节，是发展重工业。
    苏联人民在党的领导下，在极短的时期内建成了社会主义社会，建立了强大的工业——我国在向共产主义道路胜利前进中的物质基础。
             ×××
    列宁和斯大林科学地论证了实现我国社会主义工业化的绝对必要性。
    伟大的列宁曾指出，社会主义的唯一物质基础，就是巨大的机器工业，而且，最快地消除由来已久的技术和经济上的落后性，对于我们国家来说是一个生死存亡的问题。
    斯大林同志依据列宁的指示，制定了社会主义工业化的原理。他指出，工业化的实质在于发展重工业及其心脏——机器制造业。他以建立和发展大机器工业的伟大纲领武装了党和苏联人民；这样的工业能够领导农业，实现农业的社会主义改造。
    斯大林说：“我们在建设新的政治制度——苏维埃制度方面，已经赶上并超过了先进的资本主义国家。这是很好的。可是这还不够。要达到我国社会主义底最终胜利，还必须在经济和技术方面赶上并超过这些国家。我们或者是达到这个目的，或者是失败。”（斯大林全集，俄文版，十一卷，二四八页）
    世界上第一个社会主义国家发展的内外环境，都说明必须迅速地实行工业化。处在敌对的资本主义包围中的工人阶级专政的国家，如果没有重工业，没有自己的机器制造业，就不可能保护和巩固自己在经济上的独立。斯大林同志在一九四六年二月九日的演说里说道：“党知道战争日益逼近，没有重工业就无法保卫国家，所以必须赶快着手发展重工业，假如这件事稍迟一着，那就等于失败。党记住了列宁底指示：没有重工业，便无法保持国家的独立；没有重工业，苏维埃制度就会灭亡。因此，我国共产党也就排斥了‘通常的’工业化道路，而从发展重工业来开始实行国家工业化。”
    社会主义工业化政策的实施，是有很大困难的，因为只能依靠内部积累的源泉，这就要厉行最大的节约，要有忍受暂时牺牲的决心。困难并且在于，迅速地发展工业要求为数众多的工程技术干部和经济干部，而且必须在开展新的建设的同时来造就这些干部。
    斯大林同志在苏维埃的社会制度和国家制度中，在社会主义经济制度的优越性中，在群众的创造性的劳动和政治的积极性中，看到了克服这些困难及顺利解决社会主义国家工业化历史任务的可能性。
    实行社会主义工业化，是符合工人阶级和农民的切身利益的。
    社会主义的生产与资本主义的生产不同，它的目的不是吸取利润，而是要保证最大限度地满足苏维埃社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。重工业及其心脏——机器制造业的建立和发展，是在技术上重新装备农业、轻工业与食品工业并使之提高的具有决定意义的物质前提。只有在这个基础上，劳动人民的物质福利才能不断地增长起来。
    列宁、斯大林的社会主义工业化政策，是党在跟党和苏联人民最凶恶的敌人、跟托洛茨基分子及布哈林分子进行最尖锐的毫不妥协的斗争中实现的。这些人民的敌人，曾极力想破坏工业化，想在我国恢复资本主义。
    苏联人民在实行斯大林的社会主义工业化政策中无限忠诚地支持了党。劳动群众的创造的积极性、社会主义竞赛的极其广泛的开展，保证了斯大林工业化计划的完成。
    由于实行斯大林的国家工业化政策的结果，苏联在空前短促的时期内从在工业方面是落后的农业国变成了强大的工业国。在一九二八到一九四○年这十三年内，苏联消除了自己在技术和经济上的落后性，结果在工业生产总量方面跃居欧洲的第一位。
    我们国家的工业化，是在高度技术基础上，在电气化基础上开展起来的。就工农业的新的技术装备来看，苏联已成了世界上最先进的国家。
    由于建立了先进的大工业，才能把农业迅速地转上社会主义轨道，在技术上改造它，并且使农业的生产率有了巨大的增长。
    斯大林同志指出，生产的这样空前的增长，不能认为是我国从落后到进步的一般的发展。“这是一个飞跃，借助于它，我们祖国从落后国变成了先进国，从农业国变成了工业国”。决定国家生产力巨大发展的主要和决定的力量，乃是新的社会主义生产关系。
    斯大林社会主义工业化政策的巨大意义，特别有力地表现在伟大卫国战争时期。非常有远见的斯大林社会主义工业化政策，拯救了我们祖国免于灭亡，免于德国帝国主义的奴役。
    苏联工业在战后年代里，继续以飞快的速度发展着。战争的后果在短短的时期内被消除了，工业生产大大地超过了战前水平。在苏维埃政权的年代里，苏联的工业生产增加到三十九倍。一九五二年生产的工业品约为一九四○年的二点三倍，其中生产生产资料的部分则增为二点七倍。
    社会主义国家工业化和农业集体化，为社会主义基本经济法则开辟了广阔的活动场所；创造了全部社会生产在最高技术基础上、在经常提高的人民消费水平上不断增长和完善的可能性。
    苏联人民在遵循斯大林的纲领建成了社会主义之后，便着手建设共产主义。斯大林教导说，准备向共产主义过渡的基本先决条件之一，是切实地保证全部社会生产的不断增长，而生产资料生产的增长要占优先地位。
    十九次党代表大会对于自一九五一年至一九五五年苏联发展第五个五年计划的指示，是苏联工业实力进一步增长的伟大纲领。十九次党代表大会的这一指示，是在伟大的斯大林直接领导下拟制的。
    伟大的斯大林关于准备从社会主义向共产主义过渡的条件的思想、关于生产资料生产的增长要占优先地位的思想、关于社会主义生产要服从最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质与文化需要的任务的思想，都具体地表现在五年计划里。
    第五个五年计划规定工业和国民经济一切部门要进一步达到巨大的高涨。按照指示规定，全部工业的总产量在五年期间必须增加百分之七十左右，生产资料的生产增加百分之八十，消费资料的生产大约增加百分之六十五。
    党和政府在实行斯大林同志的规划时，不断地指导社会主义工业沿着技术进步的道路发展。仅仅从一九五一到一九五二年这段时间，祖国机器制造业就创造了一千一百种左右的最重要的新式机器和机械。费力劳动的机械化在战后年代里大大地前进了，电气化获得了进一步的发展。我们的工业继续以广泛的规模用现代的机器装备了农业、运输业及国民经济的其它部门。
    斯大林一向对全力发展重工业表示了特殊的关怀。他是建设如马格尼托哥尔斯克和库兹涅茨冶金联合工厂、斯大林格勒和哈尔科夫拖拉机工厂、莫斯科和高尔基汽车工厂、乌拉尔重型机器制造工厂、第聂伯水电站等好多这样巨大的社会主义工业企业的发起人。根据斯大林的规划，正在伏尔加河上、第聂伯河上、阿姆·达里河上及其它等地修建最大的水电站和灌溉系统。
    苏联社会主义工业化的经验，具有巨大的国际意义。它证明了社会主义工业化对于建立社会主义的物质和生产基础有绝对的必要；这经验便利于其它国家的社会主义建设事业的开展。
    斯大林同志说：“我们应竭尽全力来使我国成为经济上独立自主而凭借国内市场的国家，成为能吸引其他一切逐渐脱离资本主义体系而进入社会主义经济轨道的国家的中心。”（斯大林全集，俄文版，七卷，二九九页）
    斯大林同志的伟大的科学预见，光辉地实现了。脱离了资本主义世界的中华人民共和国及欧洲人民民主国家，组成了以苏联为首的强大的民主与社会主义阵营，它们实行经济上的互助合作，顺利地建设着新生活。
    苏联给人民民主国家以巨大的物质上的援助，供给他们建设工厂用的头等技术装备，帮助他们采用新的技术，精通生产。
    苏联的多方面的援助，使人民民主国家能够以飞快的速度建设社会主义工业，巩固民主与社会主义阵营。
    党和苏联人民的伟大领袖与导师斯大林同志，教导我们以全力巩固和发展社会主义工业——我们社会主义祖国经济与国防实力的牢不可破的堡垒，不断提高苏联人民幸福生活的巩固的物质基础。实现斯大林的这个遗训，是党和人民的主要任务之一。
