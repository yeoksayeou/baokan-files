The Mengsui Branch of the CPC Central Committee issued instructions in early November stating that cadres in Mengsui regional organs should universally study the general line and general tasks of the state during the transition period. The study period is stipulated to be one and a half to two months. At the end of the study, a test will be conducted in conjunction with Chapter 9 of the "History of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union," which has already been studied. In order to ensure that this study achieves good results, the Mengsui Branch of the CPC Central Committee has specially issued study focuses and study methods, and compiled relevant study documents on the general line. Wang Wenda, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Mengsui Branch of the CPC Central Committee, and other responsible cadres have also made several reports to the organ cadres in Guisui on the general line and general tasks of the state during the transition period.

Currently, cadres of various ethnic groups, including Mongolian and Han, from various leading organs in Guisui City and the Eastern District Committee of the Inner Mongolia CPC, have successively launched the study of the general line and general tasks.

    蒙绥地区干部已先后开始学习国家总路线
    中共中央蒙绥分局在十一月初指示蒙绥地区机关干部要普遍学习国家在过渡时期的总路线和总任务。规定学习时间为一个半月到两个月，学习结束时，将结合已经学习过的“联共（布）党史”第九章举行测验。中共中央蒙绥分局为了使这次学习能得到很好的效果，特地印发了学习重点和学习方法，编印了有关总路线的学习文件。中共中央蒙绥分局宣传部部长王文达等负责干部还向在归绥的机关干部作了多次有关国家在过渡时期的总路线和总任务的报告。
    目前驻归绥市的蒙绥各领导机关及中共内蒙古东部区党委的蒙、汉等各族干部，已先后展开了总路线和总任务的学习。
