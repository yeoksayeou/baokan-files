Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 10th. The US side's explanatory work has proceeded smoothly for eight consecutive days. Two hundred and fifty South Korean prisoners of war have listened to the explanations, and not one has requested repatriation. However, the Korean-Chinese side's explanatory work has been suspended for twenty-four days due to the US side's special agents opposing segregation. Since the Korean-Chinese side's explanatory work began on October 15th, it has only been conducted seven times, totaling forty-three hours. This is an extremely unequal and unreasonable phenomenon.

Today, the Rhee Syngman explanation personnel continued to refuse to give the necessary explanations to the prisoners of war and resorted to escaping from the explanation tents. Every prisoner of war who entered the tent quietly listened to the explanation and then raised some questions about living a peaceful life after returning home, asking the explainers to clarify them. In the second tent, a young prisoner of war quietly listened to the explanation for more than twenty minutes while smoking a cigarette, then raised his hand to the chairman of the auxiliary body to ask a question. He asked, "If I go home, will my life be guaranteed?" He continued, "My family used to have more than twenty mu of land, but because we couldn't pay the taxes, you confiscated it, leaving my family of seven or eight people with nothing to eat. Can you return this land to me?" But the answer he received was: "You want us to give you all the happiness!" After saying this, the Rhee Syngman explanation personnel angrily said to the Indian chairman, "My explanation is finished!" Then he pushed away the stool and quickly fled the tent. This Rhee Syngman explanation personnel gave explanations to four prisoners of war this afternoon, and three times he walked out of the tent before the prisoners of war finished speaking. In the first tent, a prisoner of war only stayed in the tent for three minutes, and before he could even open his mouth, the Rhee Syngman explanation personnel said that the explanation was over, picked up his briefcase, and hurriedly walked out of the tent.

The situation of explanation work in Songgok-ri forms a sharp contrast to the situation in Dongchang-ri. In Dongchang-ri, the prisoners of war wanted to listen to the explanations, but the Rhee-Chiang special agents prevented and disrupted the prisoners of war from listening to the explanations, even arranging in advance for the prisoners of war to block their ears with their hands or stuff them with paper. The Korean-Chinese side's explanation representatives requested to give patient explanations to the prisoners of war who were suspicious, but were obstructed by the US representatives and the Swiss and Swedish members. In recent days, in Songgok-ri, South Korean prisoners of war have asked to listen to explanations and asked the explainers to clarify questions about living a peaceful life, but the Rhee Syngman explanation personnel have adopted an attitude of evasion and refusal to give explanations. In today's explanations, the Rhee Syngman explanation personnel in some tents even fled the tents, forcing the chairman of the auxiliary body to use force to drive the prisoners of war out of the tents. (Carried out by several Indian soldiers.) Of the thirty South Korean prisoners of war who listened to the explanation today, nineteen were forcibly driven away. The Swiss member of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission opposed the use of force against the Rhee-Chiang special agents in Dongchang-ri who prevented the prisoners of war from listening to the explanation, but made no statement today about the use of force against the South Korean prisoners of war who were willing to listen to the explanation. The prisoners of war who were forcibly driven away today all mentioned that Article III, Paragraph 9 of the "Terms of Reference" should be observed and should not be undermined by the actions of the Rhee Syngman explanation personnel fleeing the tents and refusing to give explanations. Paragraph 9 stipulates: "Prisoners of war shall have the freedom and convenience to state and communicate to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the representatives of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and its subsidiary bodies, and to notify them of any desires of the prisoners of war themselves."

Today, the increasingly annoyed Rhee Syngman explanation personnel even violated the "Terms of Reference" and "Working Rules" and insulted the prisoners of war. The Rhee Syngman explanation personnel in the second tent rudely shouted at a prisoner of war: "You kid, get out!" On another occasion, this explanation personnel openly threatened the prisoners of war, saying: "If you go through this door (referring to the door for applying for repatriation), you can live a peaceful life; if you go through that door (referring to the door for not applying for repatriation), you will be a prisoner of war forever!" When the prisoner of war pointed out that he was making threats, the Rhee Syngman explanation personnel even roared: "A dog in school can bark out the sound of reading after three years!"

### 美方的解释工作顺利地连续进行了八天  我方的解释却因特务破坏长期被迫停顿

    美方的解释工作顺利地连续进行了八天
    我方的解释却因特务破坏长期被迫停顿
      【新华社开城十日电】美方的解释工作到今天已顺利地连续进行了八天，有二百五十名南朝鲜战俘听取了解释，没有一个人要求遣返。但是，朝中方面的解释工作由于美方特务反对隔离已停顿了二十四天。朝中方面的解释工作自十月十五日开始以来，总共只进行了七次，计四十三个钟头。这是双方不对等的极不合理的现象。
    今天李承晚解释人员继续拒绝对战俘作必要的解释，采取了逃出解释帐篷的手段，每一个走进帐篷的战俘在安静地听过解释以后，提出一些有关回家后过和平生活的疑问要求解释者澄清。在第二号帐篷，一个年轻的战俘吸着纸烟安静地听了二十多分钟解释，然后向附属机构主席举手要求提出疑问。他问道：“我要是回家，生活能不能得到保障呢？”他接下去说：“从前我家里有二十多亩地，因为缴不上税款，被你们没收了，弄得一家七、八口人没饭吃。你们能不能把这些田地归还给我呢？”但他所得到的回答却是：“你想要我们把一切幸福都给你！”李承晚解释人员说完这句话后就怒气冲冲地向印度主席说：“我的解释完了！”接着就推开凳子，急速地逃出帐篷去。这个李承晚解释人员在今天下午共向四个战俘进行了解释，有三次不等战俘说完话就走出了帐篷。在第一号帐篷里，有一个战俘在帐篷中只停留了三分钟，还来不及开口，李承晚解释人员就说解释结束，夹起皮包匆匆走出帐篷。
    松谷里解释工作的这种情况与东场里的情况形成了尖锐的对照。在东场里，战俘想听解释，但是李蒋特务却阻止和扰乱战俘听解释，甚至在事先布置好要战俘用手堵住耳朵或用纸团塞住耳朵。朝中方面的解释代表对心怀疑惧的战俘要求进行耐心的解释，但却受到美方代表和瑞士、瑞典委员的阻挠。几天来，在松谷里，南朝鲜战俘要求听解释，要求解释者澄清有关过和平生活等事项的疑问，但李承晚的解释人员却采取了躲避和拒绝提出解释的态度。在今天的解释中，有些帐篷的李承晚解释人员竟逃出帐篷，迫使附属机构主席使用武力把战俘赶出帐篷。（由几个印度兵抬出去。）今天听解释的三十个南朝鲜战俘中，就有十九个是被用武力赶走的。中立国遣返委员会的瑞士委员对东场里阻止战俘听解释的李蒋特务反对使用武力，而在今天对愿听解释的南朝鲜战俘使用武力时却没有任何表示。今天被用武力赶走的战俘都提到“职权范围”第三条第九款应被遵守，不应被李承晚解释人员的逃离帐篷拒绝解释的行动所破坏。第九款规定：“战俘应有自由与便利向中立国遣返委员会和中立国遣返委员会的代表及其附属机构陈述和通讯，并通知他们关于战俘自己的任何事情的愿望。”
    在今天，愈来愈烦恼的李承晚解释人员甚至还违反“职权范围”和“工作细则”辱骂了战俘。第二号帐篷里的李承晚解释人员曾粗暴地对一个战俘吼叫道：“你这小子，给我出去！”另一次，这个解释人员公开威吓战俘说：“你走这个门（指申请遣返的门），就可以过和平生活；你走那个门（指不申请遣返的门），就永远要当战俘！”当战俘指出他是在进行威吓时，李承晚的解释人员竟又咆哮道：“学校里的狗学三年也可以叫出读书的声音”！
