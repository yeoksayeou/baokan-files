    At the Home of Martyr Park Jae-geun
    Shi Panqi
    At the end of September, I came to the hometown of Martyr Park Jae-geun – Hyeon-ri, Sip’o County (newly established county). A dugout-like house where the Korean people lived during the war, built beside a small stream at the foot of a mountain, with flowers blooming everywhere and flowing water gurgling in front of the door, this is where Martyr Park Jae-geun lived before his death. The martyr's wife, Lee Ok-seon, is forty-two years old this year and is a hardworking and simple rural woman. She goes to the fields to work every day, cooks at home, and takes care of her thirteen-year-old eldest daughter, Suk-yeong, and her youngest daughter, Bok-soon, who is not yet three years old. This year, her family planted one thousand pyeong (three hundred and sixty pyeong equals one Chinese mu) of corn and about five hundred pyeong of buckwheat, and also some vegetables.

    After Martyr Park Jae-geun sacrificed his life to rescue wounded Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers, the martyr's family immediately received help and care from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, the Korean government, and the people. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army troops stationed near the martyr's hometown often came to the martyr's home to express condolences, present flags, flowers, and gifts, and help the martyr's family with production and solve all possible difficulties. On October 9th, a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army decided to build a new house for the martyr's family. Deputy platoon leader Li Caizhang led eighteen soldiers in working hard for less than two weeks, and a house more than twelve meters long and five meters wide was built. The house is divided into three rooms: the kitchen on the left, the guest room on the right, and the bedroom in the middle. The bedroom has a Korean-style heated floor. A corridor was paved with wooden boards in front of the door, and a rectangular yard was fenced in front of the house. Compared to the original dilapidated house where you couldn't even stand up straight, this is a very beautiful and comfortable residence.

    In order to commend the martyr's great spirit, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea specially awarded him the "First Class National Flag Medal." The Korean people proudly call him "the Korean Luo Shengjiao." The Ri People's Committee often sends people to visit his home to solve the difficulties of the martyr's family, and the people in the village are also very concerned about their lives. Once, I remember very clearly, it was on the evening of October 13th. We were already asleep when suddenly, the sound of singing and playing the harmonica outside woke us up. The translator told me, "These are members of the village's Democratic Youth League bringing firewood. They didn't have time during the day, so they came at night." I looked at the watch; it was already midnight. Another time, when I went to her field with the martyr's wife, she told me that the land was all planted by the people in the village, and the weeds in the field were pulled by the students for her. The people in the village often put aside their own affairs to help her first. This time, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army built a house for her, but they didn't know how to make Korean-style doors and windows, so two carpenters from the village, Kim Gyu-seong and Lee Taek-yeol, automatically put down their own work and rushed to make five doors and three windows for her family.

    In order to permanently commemorate Martyr Park Jae-geun, the Sip’o County People's Committee established the "Park Jae-geun Production Team," consisting of thirteen people, and elected Kim Ji-gu, the recipient of the "Third Class National Flag Medal," as the team leader, because he was carrying the same stretcher with Park Jae-geun when he was wounded. Kim Ji-gu said to me, "I personally saw Comrade Park Jae-geun sacrifice himself to rescue wounded Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers. This great internationalist spirit moved me very much. I must learn from him, lead the production team well, and ensure that we play a leading role in the country's recovery and construction in the future. Only in this way can we be worthy of Comrade Park Jae-geun."

    On October 24th, Comrade Fan Yangchun, director of the political department of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, came and personally presented the golden-lettered red plaque with the words "Home of Martyr Park Jae-geun" to the martyr's family. This plaque is hung on the lintel of the middle room of this new house. Then, the Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea also came. Zhang Zhiyi, the deputy head of the Fourth General Sub-Delegation of the delegation, presented flowers and gifts to the martyr's family on behalf of the Chinese people.

    October 27th was the first anniversary of Martyr Park Jae-geun's sacrifice. On this day, representatives of the Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, representatives of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, representatives of the Korean People's Army, representatives of the People's Committee of Sip’o County and Hyeon-ri, and the martyr's family came to the martyr's tomb and held a grand memorial ceremony according to Korean customs.

    Now, the family of Martyr Park Jae-geun has begun a new life in the newly built home. The corn has also been harvested, and the winter food and firewood have been prepared. I have lived here for nearly a month, and I am deeply moved by the respect and love that the martyr's family receives from the people.

    在朴在根烈士家里
    时盘棋
    九月底，我来到朴在根烈士的家乡——洗浦郡（新设郡）县里。一所朝鲜人民在战争时期居住的防空洞式的房子，盖在傍山的一个小水沟旁，门前鲜花遍地，流水淙淙，这就是朴在根烈士生前居住的地方。烈士的妻子李玉善，今年四十二岁了，是一个勤劳朴实的农村妇女。她每天要下地劳动，在家做饭，并且要照顾她那正在上学的十三岁的大女孩淑英和不满三岁的小女孩福顺。她家今年种了一千坪（三百六十坪等于中国一亩）玉蜀黍和五百坪左右的荞麦，还种了一些蔬菜。
    朴在根烈士为抢救志愿军伤员而献出自己的生命以后，烈士家庭立即受到志愿军、朝鲜政府和人民的帮助和关怀。驻在烈士家乡附近的志愿军部队，经常到烈士家里来慰问、献旗、献花、献礼，帮助烈士家里生产和解决一切可能解决的困难。十月九日，志愿军某部决定给烈士家里盖一座新房子。副排长李财章带着十八个战士紧张地劳动了不到两个星期，就把一座长十二公尺宽五公尺多的房子盖好了。房子共分三间：左边是灶房，右边是客室，中间是卧室，卧室里修的是朝鲜式的通炕。门前用木板铺起了走廊，房前还用篱笆围了个长方形的院子。比起原来那间直不起腰的破旧房子，这要算很好看很舒适的住宅了。
    为了表扬烈士的伟大精神，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府特授予“一级国旗勋章”，朝鲜人民骄傲地称他为“朝鲜的罗盛教”，里人民委员会经常派人到他家去看望，解决烈士家属的困难，村里的人也非常关心他家的生活。有一次，我记得很清楚，是在十月十三日晚上，我们已经睡了，忽然，外边一阵唱歌和吹口琴的声音把我们吵醒了，翻译同志告诉我说：“这是村里的民主青年同盟的盟员送柴来的，他们白天没有时间，就晚上来了。”我看了看表，已是午夜十二点。另一次，当我和烈士的妻子一起到她地里去的时候，她对我说，这些地都是村里人民帮她种的，田里的草也是学生们替她拔的。村里的人常常放下自己的事，尽先帮助她。这次志愿军给她盖房子，不会做朝鲜式的门窗，于是村里的两位木匠金奎星和李泽烈，就自动放下自己手头的活，赶着给她家做了五个门三个窗子。
      洗浦郡人民委员会为了永久纪念朴在根烈士，特成立了“朴在根生产班”，一共十三个人，选出
  “三级国旗勋章”获得者金智九为班长，因为他是在朴在根生前，和朴在根共抬一个担架同时负伤的。金智九对我说：“我亲眼看到了朴在根同志为抢救中国人民志愿军伤员而牺牲了，这种伟大的国际主义精神使我非常感动。我一定要向他学习，把生产班领导好，保证今后在国家的恢复和建设工作中起带头作用，只有这样才能对得起朴在根同志。”
      十月二十四日，志愿军某部政治部主任范阳春同志来了，亲自把上写“朴在根烈士之家”的金字红匾献给烈士的家属。这块匾就挂在这座新房子当中一间的门楣上。接着，中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团也来了，慰问团第四总分团张志一副团长代表中国人民向烈士家属献花、献礼。
    十月二十七日，是朴在根烈士牺牲一周年的日子。这天，中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团代表、中国人民志愿军代表、朝鲜人民军代表，还有洗浦郡和县里的人民委员会代表以及烈士家属一起来到烈士墓前，按照朝鲜的风俗习惯，举行了隆重的祭典。
    现在，朴在根烈士的家属已经在新建的家园里开始了新的生活。玉蜀黍也打下来了，过冬的粮食、柴草都准备好了。我在这里住了将近一个月，我深深为烈士家属受到人们的尊敬和爱戴所感动。
