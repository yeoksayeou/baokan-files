    The Master on the Construction Site
    By our staff reporter, Zhu Bo

    On the construction site of the Furnace Construction Engineering Company, everyone praises Yu Linzhi of the Civil Engineering Team No. 1 from the bottom of their hearts. He is an electrician with more than ten years of experience, and he is both active and responsible in his work.

    Whenever he completes his own tasks, he wanders around the construction site, looking here and there. He picks up even a scrap of leftover wire or a small nail that has been dropped on the ground. If he encounters a problem in the project, he always tries to find out the details and then helps to come up with an idea. People who don't know him say behind his back that he likes to meddle in "other people's business," but people who know him feel differently and are willing to be with him. They greet him from afar: "Master Yu, come over here and help us think of some solutions."

    Now no one calls him a meddler in "other people's business" anymore, because everyone realizes that the comrades working on the construction site are all masters of the construction site.

    Back in October 1951, the Civil Engineering Team No. 1 was building a concrete road in the Class D residential area. This road was paved with stones at the bottom, then a layer of small gravel, and then concrete was poured. The project deadline was three and a half months. But difficulties were encountered as soon as construction started. It turned out that the roadbed was too soft, and the fifteen-ton roller was too heavy to use. There were no rollers lighter than fifteen tons, so the project was delayed for several days and could not start. People on the construction site were worried about this. Later, a technician named Qian Gengsheng came up with an idea. He suggested using a four-ton iron roller and having fifty or sixty workers pull the iron roller to compact the road. At that time, because there was no other good way, the leadership agreed to Qian Gengsheng's suggestion.

    At that time, Lao Yu was working in the mechanical group. One day, after he finished his work, he went to the construction site and saw dozens of people laboriously pulling an iron roller to compact the road. He thought: This won't work! It's like an old ox pulling a broken cart. Working like this, how can this road be completed in three and a half months? It won't be completed in seven months. Thinking of this, he went to find the technician.

    "Technician Qian, this method won't work. When will this road be repaired?"

    "If this method doesn't work, whoever can come up with a good method can use a good method." Qian Gengsheng said indifferently.

    "There is a method. You can use a machine to pull it."

    "You just say it without thinking carefully. We also thought about using a machine to pull it, but the foundation is too soft. How can the machine walk on it? And the road is not wide, how can the machine turn while dragging an iron roller?"

    "You can use winches to pull the iron roller in sections, one winch at each end, pulling back and forth with a relatively long steel cable, without having to turn."

    Qian Gengsheng thought that Lao Yu was too long-winded, and said: "That won't work either, because the roller is light. If you pull it too fast, it won't compact well. If you pull it too slowly, isn't it the same as now? I advise you not to meddle in 'other people's business' and do your own work properly!"

    "What are you talking about! Meddling in 'other people's business'? Is this 'other people's business'? I am doing this for the sake of the entire construction. In the past, if you asked me to meddle in 'other people's business,' I wouldn't care!" Lao Yu was also angry. He thought that Technician Qian was not humble enough. "Even if I am meddling in 'other people's business,' I have to meddle."

    Lao Yu returned to the mechanical group and discussed his idea with other workers. Everyone said that this method was good and encouraged him to go to the Party branch secretary.

    Party branch secretary Zhang Wenming agreed with his method very much. He said: "What if we make the iron roller heavier? If we can, it will compact faster." "Why can't we make it heavier? The iron roller is empty, and we can add sand inside. This way, the iron roller won't jump even if we pull it faster." "Let's do it this way. We will talk to the administrative leaders, and if they agree, we will do it this way."

    The leaders all agreed with the method proposed by Lao Yu, and immediately approved the mechanical group to be responsible for this work. As a result, it went very smoothly. The task that was originally supposed to take three and a half months was completed in one and a half months. The company awarded Lao Yu and the mechanical group a banner and a bonus of two million yuan for this matter.

    This happened more than a year ago. At that time, there were people like Technician Qian Gengsheng who thought that Lao Yu liked to meddle in "other people's business." Now it is different. People believe that everyone participating in the construction of the motherland should be like Lao Yu.

    Since Lao Yu came to the blast furnace construction site, his work has become even more active. He wants to know everything about the construction site, just like he said: "This is not the past, I can't work in a muddle-headed way." People who used to work with Lao Yu also said that Lao Yu's temper has changed, but Lao Yu said: "My temper hasn't changed. In the past, it was because I was working for the enemy that I didn't care about anything. But when I return to my own home, it's different. I have to be careful and calculating everywhere. Now, the construction site is my home. A homeowner can't not know the situation at home, and I can't ignore things that happen."

    One noon in September, after Lao Yu finished his own work, he took the initiative to go to the team headquarters to receive new work assignments. When he walked to the electrical section, he saw that the construction site of the circulating water pump station was very quiet, and there were several workers chatting idly next to it. He was very surprised, because in recent days, the company had called on everyone to complete the construction task ahead of schedule and strive for the early iron production of a certain blast furnace. The workers on the construction site were actively taking action. He wondered why these workers were idle here. He walked over and asked them:

    "Folks, why has the work on the circulating water pump station stopped?"

    "Why not stop? Do you want to cause a flood??" one worker said dissatisfied.

    "What exactly happened?" Lao Yu wanted to find out the problem, so he asked the other workers.

    Another worker said: "The circulating water pump station has just started construction for a few days, and a concrete water pipe was discovered. Engineer Liu and Team Leader Jin called for a halt to work, pending their study before resuming construction. Everyone is anxious about this matter, because the construction of this pump station has been delayed for several days."

    Lao Yu heard that Engineer Liu and Team Leader Jin were both at the team headquarters, so he hurried to the team headquarters. As soon as he walked in the door, he saw Engineer Liu and Team Leader Jin sitting there in contemplation, just like they usually did when encountering difficult problems.

    "I heard that a water pipe was discovered at the circulating water pump station?"

    Engineer Liu saw Lao Yu come in and offered him a seat. He said: "Yes, the construction of the circulating water pump station has been delayed for too long. At the beginning, it was because the design did not estimate the amount of work sufficiently, and the start of construction was delayed due to redesign. Now, the design problem has been solved, and just a few days after starting construction, we encountered this unlucky water pipe. If we continue construction, we must cut off the water pipe, but the water pipe belongs to the power plant and directly connects to the third cooling tower of the power plant. If we cut off the water pipe, the water will flow out, and the power plant will have to shut down, which will affect the production of many factories."

    "Can't you think of a solution?" Lao Yu said.

    Team Leader Jin continued: "The only way is to block the water from the cut-off point, but blocking the water also has difficulties. The water pipe is very thick, and the water level is more than three meters above the ground. The water pressure is ten tons. When blocking the water, you can only go down from the water gate, but the water gate is very small, and it is nearly thirty meters away from the place where the water is blocked. Although we have thought of some ways, they are all unusable. For example, some people suggested using a freezer to freeze the water at the cut-off point, and some suggested pouring concrete at the cut-off point of the water pipe. We have sought the opinions of Soviet experts on these methods, and the experts believe that they are all unusable." After Team Leader Jin finished speaking, he asked Lao Yu: "Lao Yu, can you use your brain to think of a solution?" Team Leader Jin and Engineer Liu both knew Lao Yu, and they wanted to find a solution to block the water from this old worker.

    After listening to these situations, Lao Yu pondered for a while, and then slowly said: "I do have an idea, but I don't know if it will work. When I was working in Dalian during the puppet Manchukuo period, I saw the Japanese use large balloons to salvage ships that had sunk into the sea. Divers sent deflated large balloons into the ship's cabin, and then inflated the balloons. The balloons slowly squeezed the water out of the ship, and the ship floated up. If we also use balloons in the water pipe, and then inflate the balloons, I wonder if we can block the water?" Engineer Liu and Team Leader Jin considered it and said: "This is a good idea. Let's go and discuss it with the Soviet experts and see if this method can be used."

    The Soviet experts believed that this method might be successful and might as well try it. Manager Hou of the Furnace Construction Company also agreed with his method and decided to send Engineer Liu and him to the Dalian Maritime Bureau to borrow large balloons for salvaging ships.

    The Dalian Maritime Bureau did not have this kind of equipment. The comrades of the Maritime Bureau enthusiastically helped them and introduced them to the Shanghai Salvage Company to borrow, but they were not sure if the Salvage Company had this kind of equipment. They thought: Going to Shanghai has not been approved by the leaders, and there is no guarantee that we can borrow balloons, so we decided to return.

    After returning, they heard that the head office already had an opinion: If we really can't think of a solution, we will have to stop the power generation for three days to rush the repairs. Yu Linzhi was very anxious about this matter. He thought: How can we stop the power generation! How much loss will this cause to production! We must find a way to avoid the power outage. But it is indeed not easy to think of a proper solution. For several days, Lao Yu has been repeatedly thinking about the problem of blocking the water, both day and night. He forgot to shave his beard, and the wrinkles on his face seemed to be more pronounced.

    One night, Lao Yu was lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, unable to fall asleep. He suddenly thought of the umbrella used when it rained. The umbrella can be enlarged and reduced. If we make something like an umbrella according to the shape and size of the water pipe, can't we block the water? He thought about this for a long time. The next day, he went to find Engineer Liu and told Engineer Liu about the method he had thought of at night. Engineer Liu considered it and said: "This method can be studied. I just don't know if it can withstand such a large pressure?" Lao Yu said: "I have also thought about this problem. When making this thing, we must design it according to the size of the water pressure, and use two steel cables to pull it from both ends." Engineer Liu agreed with this method and encouraged him to make a model first, and then study it further, so that he can design it and submit it to the leaders for approval.

    Lao Yu used a cardboard box to make a model according to the principle that the umbrella can be opened and closed. Two iron wires were tied to both ends of the model. When the iron wire at the front was pulled, the model contracted, and when the iron wire at the back was pulled, the model opened. He also initially thought about the materials used to make this water blocker: the shaft of the water blocker should be made of round steel, the supports should be made of round iron, with angle iron and wooden boards in the middle, and elastic honeycomb rubber around it. It should be tied with steel cables at both ends, so that even if the water pressure is greater, it can withstand it.

    The Soviet experts and leaders were very happy after hearing his report on the manufacture of the water blocker, because they were more anxious about the water blocking problem than others. Everyone would think: If the water blocking problem cannot be solved, we will have to stop power generation for construction. The losses suffered by other factories due to power outages will be incalculable. Now, seeing that Lao Yu has created a water blocker, although there is no absolute certainty, we can always try it. If the water blocking is successful, wouldn't it be possible to avoid losses in production? Therefore, the plan to use the water blocker to block the water was quickly approved, and Lao Yu was designated to be responsible for manufacturing the water blocker.

    Under the assistance of Engineer Liu, Lao Yu measured the dimensions of the water pipe, designed the form of the water blocker, and started manufacturing it together with Qin Dehai and Wang Dianshu, workers from the mixed class. The materials used for the water blocker, such as angle iron, round steel, round iron, and wooden boards, were all selected from waste materials. Only the honeycomb rubber around the water blocker was purchased. The three of them spent two days to successfully manufacture the water blocker.

    Before the official water blocking, many people came to the construction site of the circulating water pump station excitedly. Even the manager, Party committee secretary, chairman of the trade union of the Furnace Construction Company, and Soviet experts were waiting at the scene to see the results of the water blocking.

    The water blocking work began. The workers clamped one end of the steel cable of the water blocker on the connected bamboo skins and went into the water pipe from the water gate. The water blocker also went down into the water. Finally, a diver wearing a diving suit weighing more than a hundred kilograms drilled into the water pipe to block the exposed gaps around the water blocker.

    The motor on the pump for pumping water sounded. Seeing that the water level was slowly dropping, suddenly the water level returned to its original state. It turned out that the diver did not wait for the water blocker to open, and stuffed the hemp cloth with lead oil into the gaps around the water blocker. When the water blocker opened, because the lead oil was very slippery, it squeezed out the hemp cloth that was stuffed in. Moreover, because the water blocker was very narrow and the water pressure was high, the water blocker did not stand firmly in the water pipe. Therefore, the first time the water was not blocked. Later, the water blocker was pulled up. After research, four legs were added to the water blocker. The legs were made of round iron and were all pressed on the back of the water blocker. If the water blocker tilted forward, the two round irons on the top would hit the pipe wall above the water pipe. If it tilted backward, the two round irons below would hit the pipe wall below the water pipe. When blocking the water for the second time, the diver was researched and told to wait until the water blocker was opened before blocking the remaining gaps around it.

    The water pipe was blocked, and the workers building the circulating water pump station began to work hard again. What about Lao Yu? He is still like before, looking here and there on the construction site after work, because the idea that the builder is the master of the project prompts him to do so.

    工地上的主人
    本报记者　朱波
    在筑炉工程公司的工地上，提起土建一队的于麟趾来谁都从内心里称赞他，他是一个有十几年工作经验的电工，干起活来又积极又负责。
    每逢他完成自己的任务以后，就要在工地上转来转去，这边看看，那边瞧瞧，地上那怕是有一截使剩下的铁丝或者丢掉的一个小铁钉，他也要拣起来，如果遇到工程上发生了问题时，他总想法打听清楚，然后帮助出个主意。不知道他的人背后说他是爱管“闲事”，知道他的人可就不同了，都愿意和他在一起，看见他远远地就招呼：“于师傅，到我们这里来，帮助我们想些办法。”
    现在没有人管他叫爱管“闲事”的人了，因为大家都认识到在工地上工作的同志都是工地上的主人。
    还是在一九五一年十月，土建一队修筑丁级住宅区的混凝土公路工程。这条公路下边是用石头铺的，在石头上又铺一层小碎石，然后再浇灌混凝土，工程期限是三个半月的时间。但是刚刚开工就遇到了困难，原来是路基太软，十五吨重压路机太重不能用，比十五吨的压路机再轻的又没有，这样就把工程耽误了好几天不能动工。工地上的人都为这件事情发愁，后来一个名叫钱更生的技术员想出一个办法，他提议用四吨重铁辊子，用五、六十个工人来拉铁辊子压路，当时因为没有别的好办法，领导上就同意了钱更生的建议。
    当时，老于在机械小组工作，有一天，他工作完了以后，就到工地上去了，远远地就看见几十个人很吃力的拉着铁辊压路。他想：这怎么能行呢？像老牛拉破车一样，这样干法，三个半月怎能完成这条公路，七个月也完成不了。想到这里，他就找技术员去了。
    “钱技术员，这样干法不行，什么时候才能修好这条公路呢？”
    “这办法不行，谁能想出好办法，就用好办法好了。”钱更生爱理不理地说。
   “有办法，可以用机器拉。”
   “你不仔细想想就说，我们也想到用机器拉，但是地基太软，机器怎么能在上面走呢？而且路又不宽，机器拖着一个铁辊怎么转弯呢？”
   “可以分段用卷扬机拉铁辊子，一头一台卷扬机，用比较长的钢丝绳来回拉，用不着转弯。”
    钱更生认为老于太噜苏了，就说：“那样也不行，因为辊子轻，拉快了就不可能压好，拉慢了还不是和现在一样，我劝你不要管‘闲事’，好好地做自己的工作去吧！”
      “这算什么话呀！管‘闲事’，这是‘闲事’吗？我是为了整个的建设，如果在过去请我管‘闲事’我还有个不管哩！”老于也生气了，他认为钱技术员太不虚心了。“就算我管‘闲事’，可是我非管不可。”
    老于回到机械小组，又把自己想的办法和其他工人商量了一下，大家都说这办法好，就鼓励他去找党支部书记去。
    党支部书记张文明非常同意他这个办法，他说：“如果再把铁辊加重一些可以不可以？如果可以那就会压的更快了。”“怎么不能加重呢？铁辊子是空的，里边还可以加砂子，这样拉快了铁辊也不会跳动了。”“就这样吧，我们去找行政领导同志谈一谈，如果同意就这样办。”
    领导上都同意老于提的办法，当时就批准由机械小组负责这个工作。结果，这样做的很顺利，本来是三个半月的任务，一个半月就完成了。公司为这件事情曾奖给老于和机械小组一个锦旗和二百万元的奖金。
    这是一年多以前的事情了，当时就有像钱更生技术员那样的人，认为老于爱管“闲事”，现在不同了，人们都认为参加祖国建设的人都应该像老于一样。
    从老于到高炉工地以后，他的工作更积极了，对工地上的一切都要求知道，正像他说的：“这不是过去，我不能糊糊涂涂地工作。”过去和老于一起工作过的人，也都说老于的脾气变了，老于却说：“我的脾气没有变，过去是因为给敌人干活，我什么都不管，但是，当我回到自己家里的时候就不同了，处处要精打细算。现在，工地就是我的家，一个当家人不能不知道家里的情况，有了事情我不能不管。”
    这是九月的一个中午，老于干完自己的工作后，就主动地到队部里去领新的工作任务，当他走到动电工段时，看到循环水泵站工地上很平静，旁边有几个工人在闲聊天，他很奇怪，因为近些天，公司号召大家提前完成建筑任务，争取某高炉早出铁，工地上的工人都积极行动起来了，不知道为什么这几个工人在这里闲着。他走过去就问他们：
  “伙计们，循环水泵站的工作怎么停下来了？”
     “不停下来怎么办，想闹水灾?？”一个工人不满意地说。
    “到底出了什么事？”老于想把问题弄清楚就问另外的几个工人。
    另一个工人说：“循环水泵站刚刚动工不几天，就发现了一根混凝土水管。刘工程师和金队长叫停工，待他们研究一下再动工。大家都为这件事情着急，因为这个水泵站的工程停了好几天了。”
    老于听说刘工程师和金队长都在队部里，他就急忙到队部里去了。刚走进门口，就看见刘工程师和金队长像往常遇到困难问题时那样，坐在那里沉思着。
      “听说循环水泵站发现了水管？”
    刘工程师看见老于进来让了让座。说：“是呀，循环水泵站的工程耽误的时间太多了，开始是因为设计上对工程量估计不足，重新进行设计而耽误了动工，现在，设计问题解决了，刚刚动工几天，就碰上这个倒霉的水管，继续动工就一定要把水管截断，但是水管是发电厂的，直接通发电厂的第三冷却塔，如果截断水管，水就会流出来，发电厂就要停电，那样就会影响很多工厂的生产。”
    “不会想一个办法吗？”老于说。
    金队长接着说：“唯一的办法是从截断的地方把水堵住，但是堵水也有困难，水管很粗大，水位又高出地面三公尺多，水的压力有十吨，堵水时只能从水闸口下去，但是水闸口很小，离堵水的地方将近三十公尺的距离。虽然也想了一些办法，但是都不能用，譬如有人建议用冰冻机把截断的地方的水冻住，有的建议用混凝土把水管截断的地方浇灌住，这些办法都征求了苏联专家的意见，专家认为都不能用。”金队长说完就问老于：“老于，你能不能动动脑筋想个办法？”金队长和刘工程师都了解老于，他们想从这个老工人身上找出一个解决堵水的办法。
    老于听了这些情况后，就沉思了一下，然后慢慢地说：“我倒是想起一个办法，不知道能不能用。在伪满时期，我在大连工作时，看见小鬼子用很大的气球打捞沉到海里的船只，潜水工人把没有气的大气球送进船舱里，然后向气球打气，气球慢慢地就把船里的水挤出来，船就浮上来了。如果我们也用气球放在水管里，然后向气球里打气，不知道能不能把水堵住？”刘工程师和金队长考虑了一下，就说：“这倒是一个办法，走，我们一起去和苏联专家商量一下，看这个办法能不能用。”
    苏联专家认为这个办法可能成功，不妨试一试看，筑炉公司侯经理也同意他这个办法，并决定派刘工程师和他一起去大连航务局借打捞船只用的大气球。
    大连航务局没有这种设备，航务局的同志很热心地帮助他们，介绍他们到上海打捞公司去借，但是，也不敢肯定打捞公司就有这种设备。他们一想：去上海没有经过领导上批准，而且又没有把握借到气球，就决定回来了。
    回来后就听说总公司已经有一个意见：如果实在想不出办法来，就只好停止发电三天，抢修工程。于麟趾为这件事情非常着急，他想：停电怎么能行呢！那样使生产会受多大损失啊！无论如何也要研究一个避免停电的办法。但是，想一个妥善的办法也的确不容易。几天来，不管白天夜晚老于都在反复地想堵水问题，胡子长了也忘记了刮，脸上的皱纹好像显得更多了。
    一天夜里，老于躺在床上，两眼注视着天花板，老是睡不着觉。他忽然想起下雨时使用的雨伞，雨伞能撑大能缩小，如果按照水管的形状和尺寸的大小做一个像雨伞一样的东西，不是可以把水堵住吗？他把这件事情想了很久。第二天，他就去找刘工程师，把自己夜里想的办法告诉给刘工程师，刘工程师考虑了一下说：“这个办法可以研究一下。就是不知道它能不能吃得住这样大的压力？”老于说：“这个问题我也想啦，做这个东西时要根据水的压力的大小来设计，而且用两条钢丝绳从两头把它拉住。”刘工程师同意这个办法，并鼓励他要他先做出一个模型来，再继续研究一下，就可以设计出来呈请领导上批准。
    老于用纸盒按照雨伞的能撑能缩的道理做了个模型，两根铁丝拴在模型的两头，前头的铁丝一拉，模型就缩紧了，把后头的铁丝一拉紧，模型就撑开了。他又初步想了一下制作这个堵水器时用的材料：堵水器的轴要用元钢，用元铁做支柱，当中角铁和木板，周围还要用有弹性的蜂窝胶皮，两头用钢丝绳拴住，就是水的压力再大，它也能够支持得住。
    苏联专家和领导上听了他制造堵水器的报告后，都很高兴，因为他们对堵水问题比别人更焦急。谁也会想到：如果堵水问题不能解决，只好停止发电来施工，这样使其它工厂的生产因停电遭受的损失将是无法计算的。现在，看到老于创造了堵水器，虽然没有十分把握，但总可以试验，如果堵水成功了，岂不是就可以避免在生产上受到的损失吗？所以，很快就批准了使用堵水器堵水的计划，并指定就由老于负责制造堵水器。
    老于在刘工程师帮助之下，测量了水管的尺寸，设计了堵水器的表样，就和混合班的工人秦德海、王殿树一起开始制造。堵水器使用的材料，像角铁、元钢、元铁、木板等，都是他们从废料里挑选出来的，只有堵水器周围的蜂窝胶皮是买来的。他们三个人用了两天的时间，就把堵水器制造成功了。
    正式堵水以前，很多人都兴奋地来到循环水泵站工地上，连筑炉公司的经理、党委书记、工会主席、苏联专家都在现场等着看堵水的结果。
    堵水的工作开始了，工人们把堵水器一头的钢丝绳卡在接起来的竹皮上，就从水闸口穿进水管里去了，堵水器也随着下水了。最后由潜水工人穿着百多斤重的潜水服钻进水管里去，堵塞堵水器四周围露着的缝。
    抽水用的水泵上的马达响了。眼看水位慢慢的下降了，但是，忽然水位又恢复到原来那样。原来是潜水工人没有等堵水器撑开，就把加上铅油的麻布塞住了堵水器周围的缝，当堵水器撑开时，因为铅油很滑，就把塞上的麻布挤掉了，而且因为堵水器很窄，水的压力又大，堵水器在水管里站的不牢靠，因此，第一次没有把水堵住。后来把堵水器拉上来，经过研究，又给堵水器上添四条腿，腿是用元铁做的，都按在堵水器的后面，堵水器如果向前倾斜，上面的两根元铁就顶住水管上面的管壁，如果它向后倾斜，下面的两根元铁就顶住水管下边的管壁。第二次堵水时，并和潜水工人研究好，要他等堵水器撑开后再堵塞周围遗留的缝。
    把水管堵住了，建筑循环水泵站的工人又紧张地工作起来了。老于呢？仍然像已往那样，工作完后在工地上这边看看那边瞧瞧，因为建筑者就是工程的主人的思想，促使他不能不这样。
