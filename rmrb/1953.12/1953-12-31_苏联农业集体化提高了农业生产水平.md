    Soviet Agricultural Collectivization Increased Agricultural Production Levels
    Chen Dake
    Tsarist Russia was a backward agricultural country
    Before the October Socialist Revolution, Tsarist Russia was a backward agricultural country. Agriculture occupied a major position in the national economy, but the level of production was very low. Most of the fertile land was in the hands of landlords and rich peasants. Thirty thousand landlords owned 70 million Russian acres of land, while 10.5 million peasant households owned only that amount. Each landlord owned an average of 2,300 Russian acres of land, while half of the peasant households owned an average of only one or two acres of land. Therefore, peasants had to endure the oppression and exploitation of landlords and cultivate their land under extremely harsh conditions. The landlords' cruel oppression and exploitation led to poverty and bankruptcy for the vast majority of peasants. Agricultural yields were extremely low, and poor harvests and famine occurred year after year. Animal husbandry was also very underdeveloped. Agricultural technology was exceptionally backward and primitive. Peasants only used old-fashioned farm tools such as wooden plows and wooden harrows to cultivate the land, and landlords were unwilling to purchase new farm tools because the labor they enslaved was cheap. According to statistics from 1910, the country's agriculture used three million primitive wooden plows, seven million wooden-handled plows, five million wooden harrows, and only 27,000 steam threshing machines. Tractors were non-existent in agriculture. At this time, class differentiation in rural areas was very intense. A small group of wealthy people—rich peasants—differentiated themselves from the well-off farmers. They bought and rented land and, like the landlords, lived by exploiting the labor of others. Most peasants, however, were increasingly plunged into unspeakable poverty. In 1901, Lenin wrote in his article "The Workers' Party and the Peasants": "The peasants live a poor and miserable life: they live with livestock, wear rags, eat coarse food... Peasants are often hungry, and in years of crop failure, they die by the thousands from hunger and epidemics; and such years of crop failure are increasing."
    Small-scale peasant economy cannot escape poverty
    The great October Socialist Revolution overthrew the rule of landlords and capitalists and established the Soviet socialist state. The broad masses of peasants were completely liberated. They received a large amount of land that previously belonged to the Tsar and landlords from the Soviet government without spending a penny. They were freed from paying about 500 million gold rubles in tribute to the landlords every year and received many farm tools and livestock. The victory of the October Socialist Revolution greatly improved the living conditions of the peasants.
    However, in the early days after the victory of the October Socialist Revolution, agriculture was still an individual small-scale peasant economy. Small-scale peasant economies could not use agricultural machinery and new agricultural technologies, so production levels were still low, and harvests did not increase much. This backward agriculture could neither meet the country's growing need for food and industrial raw materials nor enable all peasants to obtain a prosperous and civilized life. Ornychev, a member of the "Lenin" collective farm in the Krasnokutsk district of the Kharkov region of Ukraine, recalled his situation at the time: After the victory of the October Revolution, he received land that could support five people, got a horse, and bought a cow. He thought, now I can live a good life! But he worked from dawn to dusk, and after a year, two years, three years, he felt that he could only get very little from his land. Even in years of good harvest, the grain harvest was not abundant.
    So, how can this situation be changed? Lenin and Stalin pointed out that the only way is to gradually transform the dispersed, small-scale, backward agriculture into concentrated, large-scale, advanced socialist agriculture, using complex machinery and new agricultural technologies for cultivation, based on the principle of voluntariness. The Soviet Party and government, in accordance with this instruction of Lenin and Stalin, guided the peasants onto the road of collectivization. Under the conditions of rapid development of socialist industry, agricultural collectivization achieved great success.
    Agricultural Collectivization Guarantees Agricultural Upsurge
    The success of agricultural collectivization has brought about fundamental changes in agriculture. Agricultural production has developed rapidly. For example, in 1928, when the small-scale peasant economy still dominated, the national sown area was only 113 million hectares (one hectare equals 15 mu), which had increased to 150.4 million hectares by 1940. The increase in agricultural commodity output is even more astonishing. From 1926-27 to 1952-53, commodity grain increased from 10.3 million tons (one ton equals 2,000 catties) to 40.4 million tons, meat (calculated by the weight of unslaughtered livestock) increased from 2.4 million tons to 5 million tons, and milk increased from 4.3 million tons to 13.2 million tons. Cotton, sugar beets, and other industrial crops have also achieved great success.
    The development of agricultural production is particularly reflected in the high yields of agricultural products. Taking only the Ukrainian Republic as an example, its geology is similar to that of Northeast China, but their crop yields are much higher than ours. Last year, a Chinese farmers' delegation visited a collective farm in the area, and this collective farm could harvest 22 quintals (one quintal equals 200 catties) to 35 quintals of wheat per hectare, and the highest yield was as high as 45 quintals, but last year the average yield of wheat per hectare in Northeast China was less than 10 quintals. Last year, a collective farmer in the Kirovograd region harvested an average of 208.6 quintals per hectare on five hectares of corn land, but on the same land, only five or six quintals were harvested per hectare in the Tsarist era. In animal husbandry, the "Zdobutok Zhovtna" collective farm in the Darinov district of the Kiev region of Ukraine milked an average of more than 3,000 kilograms (one kilogram equals two catties) of milk from each of its 103 cows this year, each sow produced an average of 16 piglets, and each sheep sheared nearly four kilograms of wool. In the collective farms of Kazakhstan, sheep generally weigh more than 70 kilograms, and some weigh 100 kilograms; pigs weigh 200 kilograms, and some weigh 300 kilograms; cattle weigh nearly 1,000 kilograms.
    Agricultural Mechanization
    Why did agricultural collectivization make such great achievements in agricultural production? This is primarily because agricultural collectivization adopted agricultural technology reforms based on modern technology.
    As early as during the Second Stalin Five-Year Plan, Soviet agriculture had become the largest mechanized agriculture in the world. Currently, on the land of collective farms, there are 969,000 tractors (calculated according to the standard number of units of 15 horsepower), 225,000 grain combine harvesters, and a large number of other agricultural machines. In 1952, the degree of mechanization in collective farms reached 87 percent in grain sowing, 70 percent in grain harvesting, 96 percent in fallow land plowing, and 97 percent in autumn land plowing.
    Agricultural mechanization has greatly improved the productivity of agricultural labor and reduced the burden of agricultural labor. For example, a "Stalin 80" tractor, with two five-bottom plows, can plow more than 400 mu of land a day, to a depth of nine inches, with two or three people. If human and animal power are used, one person and two animals can only plow three mu of land a day. To plow more than 400 mu of land, 150 people, 150 animals, 150 plows, and 30 harrows would be required, and the depth would only be four inches; if you want to plow nine inches deep, you need twice as much manpower and animal power. A "Stalin 80" tractor, with two combine harvesters, can harvest 90 mu of wheat a day, with weeding attached; if using manpower, even with harvesting and threshing, and the distance to the field is not too far, five people can only do one mu a day. A seeder can sow 150 mu a day; if you want to sow on such a large area of land with manpower, you need 20 people (excluding animals). The basic cultivation work of cotton has also been almost completely mechanized. A cotton picker can pick 5,000 kilograms of raw cotton per day, while manual picking can only pick 50 or 60 kilograms per day.
    In collective farms, the level of mechanization is constantly improving. At present, self-propelled combine harvesters have gradually replaced combine harvesters pulled by tractors. This machine further improves the maneuverability of the combine harvester. Even tractors are becoming more complete. Tractors fueled by kerosene have gradually been replaced by tractors powered by diesel internal combustion engines because they are cheaper and more reliable in operation. Artificial rainmakers are far superior to past water pumps. In addition, many new machines are constantly appearing on the fields of collective farms, such as potato and sugar beet harvesting combines, sunflower harvesting combines, flax harvesting combines, and corn harvesters.
    The Powerful Force of Agricultural Electrification
    The development of agricultural electrification is of particular importance for further improving the level of mechanization. At present, the degree of electrification of machine and tractor stations across the Soviet Union has reached 95 percent. Twenty percent of the country's collective farms have been fully electrified. Almost all collective farms in the regions of Moscow, Leningrad, Ryazan, and the Armenian Republic have been electrified. During the Fifth Five-Year Plan, in 1952 alone, 1,209 rural power stations were built, including 297 hydropower stations. Now Soviet agriculture has a total power generation capacity of 1.5 million kilowatts.
    Agricultural electrification has unprecedentedly improved agricultural labor productivity. Due to the use of electricity, the Soviet Union saved about 150 million man-days of labor, 20 million tractor-hours of work, and 80 million horse-days of labor in 1950. For example, after the "Lenin" collective farm in the Ryazan region used electric tractors, it greatly improved the quality of cultivation and increased crop yields by 10 to 20 percent. The use of another type of "AET-5" electric tractor can save 20 tons of oil in a farming season, so 100,000 electric tractors can save 2 million tons of oil every year. A traveler once made the following vivid description of electric tractors running in the fields of Ukraine: "Electric tractors first appeared in the first electrified machine station in Kiev in 1949. It has greater working capacity, is more convenient, and costs less than a tractor powered by an internal combustion engine. They fly through the fields, putting down and winding up electric wires, and the soil seems to boil behind them." According to the existing large amount of data, the electrification of basic fixed work has increased field labor productivity by three to four times, and the labor productivity of irrigation and water supply work has increased by ten to fifteen times.
    High Level of Mechanization in Animal Husbandry
    In animal husbandry, mechanization has also reached a very high level. Especially after the general development of agricultural electrification, all laborious tasks in animal husbandry, such as mowing grass, preserving hay, preparing feed, irrigating pastures, supplying drinking water, milking cows, shearing sheep, incubator heating, ventilation in ventilation rooms, washing livestock, and milk processing, have been widely mechanized. This has greatly improved labor productivity and reduced the labor burden. In livestock sheds, pig feed is cooked with electricity-powered machines, and cows drink water supplied by automatic drinking fountains. The mechanization of milking greatly reduces the labor of milkers, increases labor productivity by one time, reduces milking costs by 25 to 30 percent, and the milk produced is cleaner. When shearing sheep manually, one person can shear at most seven sheep a day; when shearing sheep with a machine, one person can shear 80 sheep in eight hours. And compared with manual shearing, each sheep produces half a kilogram more wool.
    Widespread Adoption of Scientific Achievements and Advanced Experience
    Only large-scale production in public ownership can fully utilize scientific achievements and new technologies, and can rapidly promote the development of agriculture. In collective farms, operating agriculture with advanced scientific methods has become a powerful weapon for collective farmers to fight for high yields. The seeds sown by collective farms are all cultivated by scientific research institutes and experimental stations. Soviet agricultural scientists are constantly supplying collective farmers with various new varieties of excellent crops. For example, the new variety of tender-leaf mulberry cultivated by some collective farms in Azerbaijan produces twice as much leaves as wild mulberry, and 11 kilograms of this mulberry leaves can raise one kilogram of silkworm cocoons. The "Progress" collective farm in Vinnitsa, Ukraine, used a new variety of winter wheat called "Success", which increased the harvest of winter wheat per hectare to 6 to 8 quintals. The breeds of livestock are also constantly being improved. For example, before the improvement of cattle breeds in the collective farms of Kazakhstan, the weight of bulls did not exceed 600 kilograms, and the milk yield of cows was 400 to 500 liters per year (one liter equals one city liter); after the improvement, the weight of bulls reached 1,000 kilograms, and the milk yield of cows was 5,000 liters per year. After the improvement of coarse-wool sheep, they not only became fine-wool sheep, but also doubled the amount of wool and meat.
    Various advanced agricultural technologies have been mastered by more and more farmers. Many regions have also set up agricultural technology training courses. After learning, the vast majority of farmers apply what they have learned to production, thereby greatly promoting the development of agriculture. For example, in the "Stalin" collective farm in the Voronezh region of Russia, the farmers who participated in the training courses last year increased their harvests a lot after learning the cross-sowing method. The Kuznetsova team, due to learning a complete set of advanced agricultural techniques, harvested 150 quintals more sugar beets per hectare than in previous years.
    Stalin once pointed out that small-scale peasant economies cannot use a large amount of fertilizer. Now, Soviet agriculture is getting more and more mineral fertilizers year by year. In 1950, the amount of nitrogen, phosphate, and potash fertilizers obtained by agriculture was almost twice as much as in 1940. Collective farms use more manure, other local fertilizers, and organic mineral granular fertilizers. In order to further increase crop yields, Soviet scientists have recently developed various new fertilizers.
    In addition, Soviet agriculture also has various agents for killing pests and weeds and uses advanced technologies to spray them. For example, using airplanes to spray agents can spray 20 hectares of land per hour, which not only improves labor productivity but also makes the agents exert greater effects. Solar energy will also be widely used in agricultural production. Using a special solar energy device, more than 50 million residents in southern Soviet Union can use solar energy for hot water, heating greenhouses, and drying vegetables and fruits for eight or nine months of the year. In central Soviet Union, solar energy can also be used for five or six months. In the Samarkand region of Uzbekistan, there are greenhouses heated by solar energy, and vegetables in the rooms can grow year-round without heating equipment. It is estimated that by 1956, the Soviet Union will be able to use more than 50,000 solar energy devices, saving 200,000 tons of fuel a year.
    Marching Towards Nature
    Backward agriculture is incapable of overcoming its dependence on natural conditions. However, at present, an unprecedented grand plan to transform and conquer nature—the Stalin Plan for Transforming Nature—is being implemented on the vast land of the Soviet Union.
    Implementing grass-arable rotation in Soviet agriculture is a major part of the great Stalin Plan for Transforming Nature. At present, all advanced collective farms have adopted scientific grass-arable rotation. According to soil conditions and needs, they rotate grain, pasture, and industrial crops to maintain soil fertility, prevent diseases and pests, and ensure an adequate supply of food, industrial raw materials, and livestock feed. For example, if land in Ukraine does not implement rotation, one mu can only harvest 240 catties of wheat a year; after implementing rotation, one mu can harvest more than 460 catties; and more pasture is grown, and animal husbandry is developed; in addition, planting grass maintains the fertility of the land, so less fertilizer and less labor are used than planting grain crops every year.
    The widespread implementation of this rotation system is only possible in socialist agriculture. Because this rotation system can only be implemented in a planned and crisis-free economy, the implementation of this rotation system must first consider the scientific combination of agricultural operations and animal husbandry.
    The other two main parts of the Stalin Plan for Transforming Nature are large-scale planting of shelterbelts and construction of ponds and reservoirs. The implementation of this plan will completely eliminate the phenomenon of drought in vast areas and will further improve socialist agriculture.
    According to the Stalin Plan for Transforming Nature, by 1965, the planned shelterbelts will have a width of 10 meters (one meter equals three city feet) to 60 meters, and their total area will be more than 6 million hectares. That is: establish eight state-owned shelterbelts in the river basins and on both banks of the largest rivers. They will cross the land of sixteen provinces, with a length of 5,320 kilometers (one kilometer equals two li) and an area of 117,900 hectares. On the land of collective farms and state farms, and on the land of the National Forest Fund Committee, plant shelterbelts with an area of 5,709,000 hectares. Among them, 3,592,500 hectares are built by the collective farms with human and material resources with the help of the state.
    The Soviet people are implementing this plan to plant shelterbelts with infinite pride and joy. For example, the collective farmers of the Stalingrad region guaranteed to complete the national afforestation plan ten years ahead of schedule and strive to build green walls around every collective farm in 1955. The collective farmers of the Zaporozhye region decided to complete the fifteen-year plan within five years. Individual collective farms, such as the "Bolshevik" collective farm in the Rostov region, even guaranteed to complete the plan to plant shelterbelts twelve years ahead of schedule. Under the selfless labor of the Soviet people, green shields will soon protect countless crops from the harm of dry winds, regulate soil and water conservation, and improve the climate.
    While planting shelterbelts, collective farms and state farms will also build more than 44,200 new ponds and reservoirs on their land from 1949 to 1955. Among them, collective farms account for more than 41,000. The Soviet people are enthusiastically starting to complete this work. By the end of 1950, the collective farms in the steppe and forest-steppe areas had restored more than 10,000 ponds and reservoirs that had been destroyed during the war and built approximately 1,500 new ponds. In August 1950, according to Stalin's proposal, the Soviet Council of Ministers passed the "Decision on Adopting New Irrigation Systems, More Fully Utilizing Irrigated Land, and Improving Dynamic Cultivation", stipulating that new irrigation systems should be adopted for more than 4.3 million hectares of land within three or four years. The new irrigation system can eliminate redundant small canals, widen permanent main canals and branch canals, increase irrigated land, expand the area of each irrigated land, facilitate the full use of agricultural machinery, improve labor productivity; reduce flooding, use more water for irrigation, and improve soil quality at the same time; reduce the burden of canal dredging and mechanize canal dredging labor; and reduce the growth of weeds and pests. This will greatly improve the agricultural technology and harvest of existing irrigated land and the irrigated land that will be added.
    Great Construction Projects of Communism
    The decision of the Soviet Council of Ministers on the great construction projects of communism is another initiative of the Stalin Plan for Transforming Nature. It stipulates the construction of the Kuibyshev and Stalingrad hydropower stations on the Volga River, the construction of the Great Turkmen Canal, the construction of the Kakhovka hydropower station and the South Ukraine Canal and the North Crimea Canal on the Dnieper River, and the construction of a canal between the Volga River and the Don River. The completion of these projects will solve the needs of electricity, irrigation, afforestation, and river transportation, will greatly strengthen the national power of the Soviet Union, and will promote the further upsurge of agriculture. For example, the great construction projects of communism can ensure a significant increase in the supply of electricity to the Soviet national economy. The three hydroelectric power stations (Kuibyshev, Stalingrad, and Kakhovka hydropower stations) alone can provide agriculture with 4.1 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity per year. In the collective farms and state farms in the areas of the great construction projects of communism, more than 6 million hectares of land can be irrigated, and water can be diverted to more than 22 million hectares of land in arid steppes and semi-desert areas. In these areas, the electrification and comprehensive mechanization of agricultural production will be completed, and electric cultivation will be universally developed, thus ensuring a substantial increase in labor productivity.
    The realization of the great Stalin Plan for Transforming Nature and the construction projects of communism will completely change the face of nature. It will unfold an infinitely magnificent beauty in front of the Soviet people.
    Happy Life of General Prosperity
    Agricultural collectivization has opened up a broad road for the rapid development of agricultural production. With the rapid development of agricultural production, the material and cultural life of collective farmers has also been continuously improved. Vi Amirikin is an ordinary member of the "Red Star" collective farm in the Ryazan district of the Ryazan region. Last year, his family received about three tons of grain, eight tons of potatoes, many other agricultural products, and 4,000 rubles in cash. In addition, Amirikin also has his own private dairy cows, pigs, sheep, and poultry. However, in the period before the establishment of the collective farm, although this family was considered a middle-peasant family, it received no more than 800 to 900 kilograms of grain and 1.5 to 2 tons of potatoes each year in the best circumstances. In the homes of members of many collective farms in the Soviet Union, they spend less than one-third of the agricultural products they earn from their annual labor days on their personal diet, and the rest is used to purchase industrial products. The prosperity of the collective farmers' lives is as the chairman of the "Puchyo" collective farm in Odessa, Bosmina, said: "If you go to the homes of the members to take a look, you will see that their families lack nothing. Each house has several rooms, shower heads and bathtubs, and urban-style furniture: sofas, wardrobes, armchairs, and nickel-plated iron beds." Because the income of collective farmers is very high, they can purchase high-end goods such as radio receivers. For example, in 1951 alone, nearly 7,000 radio receivers were installed in the rural areas of the Moscow region.
    The growth of the members' material and cultural lives is significantly reflected in all aspects of the collective farm's appearance. In the old rural areas, the church occupied the most prominent position, with the good houses of the police, priests, and rich peasants in the front row, and the dilapidated mud huts and thatched cottages of the peasants in the back. Now, this scene has disappeared. In collective farms, there are generally libraries, clubs, schools, nurseries, hospitals, shops, post offices, and radio relay stations. For example, the village of Verin Ardashat in the Arminia Ardasha district, before the revolution, had narrow and curved streets; the earthen bungalows were all dark inside. Now, the streets are wide, and trees are planted along the sides of the road, and electric lights illuminate them brightly at night. Brick houses stand on both sides: schools, nurseries, kindergartens, maternity hospitals, cinemas, radio stations, electric mills, brick and tile factories, libraries, many two-story residences, and many public and cultural institutions. A new four-story building towers in the center of the garden, which is the collective farm's club.
    The victory of the collective farm system has enabled Soviet farmers to obtain the prosperous and civilized life they have today. They firmly believe that tomorrow will be even better. Therefore, the vast majority of collective farmers can intensify their efforts to actively work for the development of collective farms, thereby promoting the further improvement of the lives of all Soviet people.

    苏联农业集体化提高了农业生产水平
    陈大可
    沙俄是一个落后的农业国家
    十月社会主义革命前的沙皇俄国，是一个落后的农业国家。农业在国民经济中占着主要的地位，但生产水平非常低下。大部分肥沃的土地都握在地主和富农的手里。三万个地主所拥有的土地达七千万俄亩，而一千零五十万个农户所有的土地也不过这个数目。每个地主平均有二千三百俄亩土地，而占半数农户平均只有一、二俄亩的土地。因此，农民不得不受地主的压迫和剥削，在极其苛刻的条件下来租种地主的土地。地主残酷的压迫和剥削，使广大农民遭致贫困和破产。农业的收获量是极低的，歉收和饥馑的现象连年不绝。牧畜业也很不发达。农业技术异常落后和原始。农民只是使用木犁木耙等旧式农具来耕耘土地，地主也因他们所奴役的劳力价格低廉而不愿购置新式农具。根据一九一○年的统计，全国农业使用三百万副原始的木犁，七百万副木柄犁，五百万副木耙，而只有二万七千具蒸汽打禾机，拖拉机在农业中是根本没有的。在这个时候，农村的阶级分化十分剧烈。从富裕农民中间分化出一小群富有者——富农。他们购买和租佃土地，也和地主一样，依靠剥削他人的劳动过活。大部分农民却日益陷入难以言喻的贫穷境地。一九○一年，列宁曾在“工人政党与农民”一文中写道：“农民过着贫穷困苦的生活：他和牲畜居住在一块，穿的是破衣，吃的是粗菜……农民们经常挨饿，每逢歉收年份，总是成千成万地死于饥饿与时疫；而这样的歉收年份又是有加无已的。”
    小农经济摆脱不了贫困
    伟大的十月社会主义革命，推翻了地主和资本家的统治，建立了苏维埃社会主义国家。广大的农民群众彻底翻身了。他们从苏维埃政府手中不花一文地得到了从前属于沙皇、地主的大量土地。他们解脱了每年缴纳给地主约五亿金卢布的贡款，并分得了很多的农具和牲口。十月社会主义革命的胜利，大大地改善了农民的生活状况。
    但是，在十月社会主义革命胜利后的初期，农业依旧是个体小农经济。小农经济不可能利用农业机器和新的农业技术，因此，生产水平还是低下的，收成没大增加。这种落后的农业，既不能满足国家对于粮食和工业原料日益增长的需要，也不能使全体农民都获得富裕和文明的生活。乌克兰哈尔科夫州拉斯诺库特区“列宁”集体农庄庄员奥尔尼切夫，曾这样地回忆当时自己的状况：十月革命胜利后，他领到了能维持五个人生活的土地，得到了一匹马，并且买了一头牛。他想，现在可过好日子了！但是，他起早贪黑地干活，过了一年、两年、三年，觉得从他的地里只能得到很少的东西。就是年景丰收，打粮也不富裕。
    那末，怎样才能改变这个状况呢？列宁和斯大林指出，唯一的办法就是根据自愿的原则，逐渐将分散的小规模的落后的农业改造为集中的大规模的先进的社会主义农业，用复杂的机器和新的农业技术进行耕作。苏联的党和政府，依照列宁和斯大林的这个指示，引导农民走上集体化的道路。在社会主义工业迅速发展的条件下，农业集体化得到了极大的成功。
    农业集体化保证了农业的高涨
    农业集体化的成功引起了农业的根本变化。农业生产获得了迅速的发展。例如，在一九二八年，小农经济还占优势的时候，全国播种面积只有一亿一千三百万公顷（一公顷合十五市亩），到了一九四○年，已增加到一亿五千零四十万公顷。农业商品产量的增加更是惊人的。从一九二六—二七年到一九五二—五三年，商品谷物从一千零三十万吨（一吨合二千市斤）增加到四千零四十万吨，肉类
  （以未经屠宰的牲畜重量计算）从二百四十万吨增加到五百万吨，奶类从四百三十万吨增加到一千三百二十万吨。棉花、甜菜和其他工业作物的生产，也有着巨大的成就。
    农业生产的发展特别是表现于农产品的高额收获上。仅以乌克兰共和国来说，那里的地质和我国的东北差不多，但他们的农作物产量就比我们高得多。去年我国农民代表参观团参观了该地的一个集体农庄，这个集体农庄每公顷小麦能收到二十二公担（一公担合二百市斤）到三十五公担，最高的竟能收到四十五公担，但我国东北去年小麦平均每公顷还没有收到十公担。基洛夫格勒州有一个集体农民，去年在五公顷的玉米地上，平均每公顷收了二百零八点六公担，但同是这块地，在沙俄时代每公顷只收五、六公担。在畜牧方面，乌克兰基辅州达利诺夫区“兹多布托克·若夫特纳”集体农庄，今年在一百零三头母牛中每头平均挤了三千公斤（一公斤合二市斤）以上的牛乳，每口母猪平均生产了十六只小猪，每只羊差不多剪了四公斤毛。在哈萨克的集体农庄中，羊一般重七十多公斤，也有重一百公斤的；猪重二百公斤，也有重三百公斤的；牛有重近一千多公斤的。
    农业的机械装备
    为什么农业的集体化会使农业生产获得这样巨大的成就呢？这首先是因为农业的集体化采用了以现代技术为基础的农业技术改革。
    早在实行第二次斯大林五年计划的时候，苏联的农业已成为世界上最大的机械化的农业。目前，在集体农庄的土地上，有九十六万九千台拖拉机
  （按十五匹马力标准台数计算），二十二万五千台谷物联合收割机和大量其他农业机器。一九五二年，在集体农庄中，操作的机械化程度在谷物播种方面达百分之八十七，在谷物收割方面达百分之七十，在休耕地犁耕工作方面达百分之九十六，秋耕地犁耕工作达百分之九十七。
    农业的机械化，大大地提高了农事劳动的生产率，减轻了农事劳动的负担。例如，一台“斯大林八十号”拖拉机，带两个五铧犁，用两三个人一天能耕四百多市亩地，深到九寸。如用人力和畜力来耕，以一个人两个牲口一天只能耕三市亩地来计算，要耕四百多市亩的土地，就要用一百五十个人、一百五十个牲口、一百五十副犁和三十副耙，而且只能耕四寸深；如果要耕九寸深，还要加一倍的人力和畜力。一台“斯大林八十号”拖拉机，带两台联合收割机，一天能收麦打麦九十市亩，附带灭杈；如用人力，连割带打，地离场不过远，五个人一天只能弄一市亩。播种机一天能播种一百五十市亩；如用人力，要在那样大的地上播种，就要用二十个人（牲口除外）。棉花的基本栽培工作也已差不多完全机械化了。摘棉机每天能收原棉五千公斤，而用手摘每天只能收五六十公斤。
    在集体农庄中，机械化的水平更在不断地提高着。目前，自动联合机已逐渐代替了以拖拉机牵引的联合机。这种机器进一步地提高了联合机的机动性。就是拖拉机也更完备起来。以火油为燃料的拖拉机，已逐渐为柴油内燃机发动的拖拉机所代替，因为它所费较贱，在工作中也比较可靠。人工降雨器远远地优越于过去的抽水机。此外，集体农庄的田野上，还不断地出现着许多新的机器，如马铃薯和甜菜收获联合机，向日葵收割联合机，亚麻收割联合机，以及玉蜀黍收割机等。
    农业电气化的强大力量
    农业电气化的发达，对于进一步提高机械化水平，是有着特别重要的意义的。目前，苏联全国各地机器拖拉机站的电气化程度已达百分之九十五。全国有百分之二十的集体农庄已经完全电气化了。莫斯科州、列宁格勒州、梁赞州和亚美尼亚共和国各州的所有集体农庄，几乎全部电气化了。在第五个五年计划中，仅一九五二年一年，就建造了一千二百零九个农村电力站，其中有二百九十七个水电站。现在苏联农业共有发电能力一百五十万瓩。
    农业的电气化空前地提高了农业的劳动生产率。由于电力的利用，苏联在一九五○年就节省了大约一亿五千万人一天的劳动，二千万拖拉机一小时的工作量，和八千万匹马一天的劳动。例如，梁赞州
  “列宁”集体农庄使用电力拖拉机后，便大大地改进了耕作的质量，使农作物收获量增加百分之十至二十。使用另一种“爱特—五”式电力拖拉机在一个耕作季内可节省二十吨石油，这样，十万台电力拖拉机每年就可节省二百万吨石油。一个旅行者曾对奔驶在乌克兰原野上的电气拖拉机作了如下生动的描述：“电气拖拉机最早是在一九四九年出现在基辅的第一个电气化的机器站里。它比用内燃机发动的拖拉机有更大的工作能力，更方便，化费也更贱。它们飞速地在田野中行驶，放下又卷起电线，泥土在它们后面好像沸腾了起来。”根据现有的大批资料，基本固定工作的电气化，已使田间劳动生产率提高了三至四倍，使灌溉供水工作上的劳动率提高了十至十五倍。
    畜牧业中的高度机械化水平
    在畜牧业方面，机械化也已达到很高的水平。特别是在农业电气化的普遍发展后，畜牧业中一切费力的工作，例如刈草、秣草保藏、饲料准备、牧场灌溉、供给饮水、挤牛奶、剪羊毛、孵化器加温、通风室内通风、洗净牲口和牛奶加工等，都广泛地机械化了。这就使劳动生产率的提高和劳动负担的减轻，达到极大的程度。在畜舍里，猪食是用以电力发动的机器来煮的，牛饮的水是由自动饮水器供给的。挤奶工作的机械化，大大减轻了挤奶者的劳动，使劳动生产率提高了一倍，挤奶成本减低了百分之二十五至三十，而且挤出的奶比较干净。用人工剪羊毛时，一个人每天最多能剪七只；用机器剪羊毛时，一个人八小时就能剪八十只。而且比人工剪时，每只羊还多出半公斤毛。
    广泛采用科学成就和先进经验
    只有公有形式的大规模生产，才能够完全利用科学的成就和新的技术，才能够很迅速地向前推动农业的发展。在集体农庄中，以先进的科学方法来经营农业，这已成了集体农民为丰产而斗争的有力武器。集体农庄播种的种籽，都是经过科学研究所和实验站培育出来的。苏联农业科学家们不断地供给集体农民以各种优良的农作物的新品种。例如，阿塞拜疆一些集体农庄栽培的新品种嫩叶桑，比野生桑产叶量高一倍，用十一公斤这种桑叶就可养出一公斤蚕茧。乌克兰温尼茨卡的“进步”集体农庄采用了“成功”号的一种新种冬麦，就使每公顷冬麦的收获量增加到六至八公担。牲畜的品种也得到不断的改良。例如，哈萨克各集体农庄在改良牛种以前，公牛体重不超过六百公斤，母牛挤乳量一年四、五百公升（一公升合一市升）；改良以后，公牛体重达到一千公斤，母牛挤乳量一年五千公升。粗毛绵羊经改良后，不仅变成了细毛绵羊，而且增加了一倍的毛和肉。
    各种先进的农业技术，已为越来越多的农民所掌握。许多地区还都设立了农业技术训练班。广大的农民经过了学习，就把所学的运用到生产中去，从而大大促使了农业的发展。例如，在俄罗斯沃龙涅什州的“斯大林”集体农庄，去年参加训练班学习的农民学习了交叉播种法后，就使收获量增加了很多。库兹涅佐娃小组，由于学习了全套的先进农业技艺，就从每公顷土地上比往年多收一百五十公担的甜菜。
    斯大林曾经指出，小农经济是不可能大量地使用肥料的。现在，苏联的农业却一年比一年得到更多的矿质肥料。在一九五○年，农业所得到的氮肥、磷肥和钾肥，差不多比一九四○年多一倍。集体农庄更大量地使用粪肥、其他的地方肥料以及有机矿质的粒状肥料。为了进一步提高农作物的产量，苏联科学家们新近更研究出各种新的肥料。
    除此之外，苏联农业还有各种的杀除害虫和野草的药剂，并用先进的技术来喷射。例如，用飞机来喷射药剂，一小时能喷射二十公顷的土地，这就不仅提高了劳动生产率，并使药剂发挥了更大的效果。太阳能也将被广泛地应用到农业生产中来了。利用一种特制的太阳能装置，可使苏联南部五千万以上居民每年有八、九个月利用太阳能来热水，加暖温室，晒干蔬菜和水果。在苏联中部也可有五、六个月利用太阳能。在乌兹别克萨马尔坎德州已有利用太阳能加热的温室，室中蔬菜不用暖气设备仍可常年生长。据估计，到一九五六年，苏联就可使用五万个以上的太阳能装置，一年可节省二十万吨燃料。
    向大自然进军
    落后的农业是无力克服对自然条件的依赖性的。但是，目前一个空前宏大的改造和征服自然的计划——斯大林改造大自然计划，正在苏联广大的土地上实现着。
    在苏联农业中实行牧草轮种制，这是伟大的斯大林改造大自然计划的一个主要部分。目前，一切先进的集体农庄都采用了科学的牧草轮种制。他们根据土壤的条件和需要，轮种着谷物、牧草和工业作物，以保持土壤的肥沃，防止病虫害，同时保证粮食、工业原料和牲畜饲料的充分供应。例如，乌克兰的土地如果不实行轮种，一市亩一年只打二百四十市斤小麦，实行轮种后一市亩就能打四百六十多市斤；而且多长了牧草，发展了畜牧业；此外，种草保持了地的肥沃力，就比年年种粮食作物少用肥料，少费人工。
    广泛地实行这种轮种制，是只有在社会主义的农业中才有可能的。因为这种轮种制只有在有计划的和无危机的经济中才能实行，这种轮种制的实行必先考虑到农作业与牧畜业的科学配合。
    斯大林改造大自然计划的另两个主要部分，就是大规模地植造防护林和建设池塘及蓄水池。这个计划的实现，将会彻底地消灭了广大地区旱灾的现象，而将使社会主义农业获得进一步的提高。
    根据斯大林改造大自然的计划，到一九六五年为止，预定的防护林，其宽度为十公尺（一公尺合三市尺）至六十公尺，其总面积在六百万公顷以上。即：在河川流域和最大河流的两岸，建立八条国营防护林带。它们要跨过十六省的土地，其长度为五千三百二十公里（一公里合二华里），所占面积为十一万七千九百公顷。在集体农庄和国营农场的土地上，在国家森林基金委员会的土地上，植造面积五百七十万九千公顷的防护林。其中有三百五十九万二千五百公顷，是在国家帮助之下，由集体农庄的人力和物力来建造的。
    苏联人民以无限骄傲和欢欣的心情来执行这个植造防护林的计划。例如，斯大林格勒州的集体农民保证要提早十年完成国家造林计划，争取在一九五五年就在每一个集体农庄四周建成绿色的墙。萨坡罗什州的集体农民决定在五年以内完成十五年的计划。个别的集体农庄，例如罗斯托夫州的“布尔什维克”集体农庄，甚至保证提早十二年完成种植防护林的计划。在苏联人民的忘我劳动下，绿色的盾牌很快就将保护着无数的庄稼，免除旱风的侵害，调节水土的保持，并且改善了气候。
    在与植造防护林的同时，集体农庄和国营农场还要从一九四九至一九五五年间，在自己的土地上建筑四万四千二百多个新的水塘和蓄水池。其中集体农庄占四万一千多个。苏联人民正以极大的热诚着手去完成这个工作。截止一九五○年末，草原区和森林草原区的集体农庄，就已恢复了一万个以上在战时被破坏的水塘和蓄水池，并建成了大约一千五百个新的水塘。一九五○年八月，根据斯大林的倡议，苏联部长会议通过了“关于采用新的灌溉系统，更充分利用受灌溉土地并改良动力耕种的决定”，规定要在三四年之内，使四百三十万公顷以上的土地面积都采用新的灌溉系统。新的灌溉系统可以取消多余的小水渠，加宽永久的总水渠和支水渠，增加灌溉的土地，使受灌溉的每块土地的面积扩大，便于充分使用农业机器，提高劳动生产率；减少浸水，把水更多地用到灌溉上去，同时改良了土质；减少疏渠的负担，使疏渠劳动机械化；减少杂草害虫的滋长。这就将大大地提高现有受灌溉的土地和将要增加的灌溉土地的农业技术和收成。
    伟大的共产主义建设工程
    苏联部长会议关于伟大的共产主义建设工程的决定，是斯大林改造大自然计划又一创举。它规定在伏尔加河建造古比雪夫和斯大林格勒水电站，在土库曼建造大运河，在第聂伯河畔建造卡霍夫卡水电站和南乌克兰运河与北克里米亚运河，在伏尔加河和顿河之间建造运河。这些工程的完成，将解决电力、灌溉、造林、河运各方面的需要，将大大加强苏联的国力，并将促使农业进一步的高涨。例如，共产主义伟大建设工程可以保证电力对苏联国民经济的供应显著增加。只由三个水力发电站（古比雪夫、斯大林格勒和卡霍夫卡水电站），农业每年就可得到四十一亿瓩时的电力。在共产主义伟大建设工程地带的集体农庄和国营农场，六百万公顷以上的土地可以得到灌溉用水，对干旱草原和半沙漠地区二千二百多万公顷土地可以引水。在这些地区，将要完成农业生产的电气化和综合机械化，电气耕种将要得到普遍的发展，这样一来，就可以保证劳动生产率的大量提高。
    伟大的斯大林改造大自然计划和共产主义建设工程的实现，将完全地改变了大自然的面貌。它将在苏联人民的面前，展开一幅无限绚烂的美景。
    大家富裕的美好生活
    农业集体化为农业生产的迅速发展开辟了宽阔的道路。随着农业生产的迅速发展，集体农民的物质生活和文化生活也得到不断的改善。维·阿米黎金是梁赞州梁赞区“红星”集体农庄的一个普通庄员，他的家庭在去年得到约三吨粮食、八吨马铃薯、许多其他农产品和四千卢布现金。此外，阿米黎金还有着自己私人的乳牛、猪、羊和家禽。但在集体农庄成立以前的时期，虽然这个家庭算是一个中农家庭，可是它在最好的场合下，每年所得到的也不过八百到九百公斤的谷物和一吨半到两吨的马铃薯。在苏联许多集体农庄的庄员家中，他们花在个人膳食的，都不到全年劳动日所得农产品的三分之一，其余的则用在购买工业品上。集体农民生活的富裕，正如敖德萨“蒲乔”集体农庄主席波斯密纳所说的那样：“你如果到庄员们家里去看一看，你便会看到他们家里什么都不缺乏。每家住所有好几个房间，有淋浴龙头和浴盆，有都市式的家具：沙发、衣橱、靠背椅和镀镍的铁床。”由于集体农民的收入很高，他们就能购置无线电收音机等上等用品。例如在一九五一年，单单莫斯科州的乡区，就装置了近七千架无线电收音机。
    在集体农庄的各方面的面貌上，都显著地表现出庄员的物质生活和文化生活的增长。在旧时的农村中，教堂占着最显著的地位，前面一排是警察、神父、富农的好房子，后面才是农民的东塌西倒的泥舍草屋。现在，这种景象消失了。在集体农庄里，一般都设有图书馆、俱乐部、学校、托儿所、医院、商店、邮局和无线电转播站等。例如阿尔明尼亚阿尔达沙脱区维林阿尔达沙村，在革命前，街道既狭隘，又弯曲；泥土的平房，里面都是黑洞洞的。现在，街道宽广，道旁栽着树木，晚上有电灯照得很亮。两旁矗立的都是砖房：有学校、托儿所、幼儿园、产科医院、电影院、无线电站、电气磨粉厂、砖瓦厂、图书馆、许多两层楼的住宅以及许多公共机关和文化机关。在花园中心高耸着一座四层楼的新建筑物，那是集体农庄的俱乐部。
    集体农庄制度的胜利，使苏联农民获得了今天的富裕而又文明的生活。他们深信，明天将更加美好。因此，广大的集体农民都能加紧为发展集体农庄而积极劳动，以此来促进全体苏联人民生活的进一步提高。
