    New Atmosphere in Rural Western Sichuan After the Opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway

    Since the opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the rural areas of the Western Sichuan Plain have taken on a new look.

    After the opening of the railway, the price gap between industrial and agricultural products has been greatly reduced. Before the opening, farmers in the Western Sichuan Plain had to sell 568 jin of rice to exchange for one bolt of fine white cloth, but now they only need 411 jin. Before the opening, they had to sell 366 jin of rice to exchange for 100 jin of salt, but after the opening, they only need 254 jin. Before the opening, they had to sell 1,100 jin of rice to exchange for 100 jin of white sugar, but now they only need 700 jin. According to statistics, after the opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the prices of more than 3,000 industrial products in Chengdu have generally decreased. However, the prices of agricultural by-products of farmers in the Western Sichuan Plain have greatly increased due to the opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. Before the opening, one jin of tobacco leaves could only be exchanged for one jin of salt, but after the opening, one jin of tobacco leaves could be sold for three jin of salt. In the past, farmers near Chengdu had to sell 15 jin of tobacco leaves to exchange for a bamboo-shell thermos, but after the opening, they only needed 6 jin of tobacco leaves to exchange for one. This has greatly stimulated the large-scale increase in the production of agricultural and special products in the Western Sichuan Plain. Hemp had never been sold outside in the past. Before the opening of the railway, more than 500,000 jin had been accumulated. After the opening, 18,000 dan were immediately sold to Tianjin, and 6,000 dan to Shanghai. The fruits of Jintang County can also be sold to Shanghai and Wuhan.

    After the opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, a large amount of agricultural production materials were supplied to the Western Sichuan Plain. Trains transported a large number of soybean cake fertilizer, a large number of insecticides, and machinery from East China and North China. For example, the Longqiao Township Cooperative in Xinfan supplied 12,000 jin of broad beans, and more than 6,000 jin of manure and bone meal for autumn planting production materials in less than a month. On September 6, the seventh district cooperative in Mianyang sold 148 iron plows in one day. This has provided favorable conditions for the patriotic production increase movement in the rural areas of the Western Sichuan Plain.

    成渝铁路通车后川西农村呈现新气象
    成渝铁路通车后，川西平原的农村呈现新气象。
    通车后，工农业产品价格上的距离大大地缩小了。川西平原农民在通车前要卖出五百六十八斤大米才能换回一疋白细布，而现在只要四百一十一斤大米就能换到一疋；通车前要卖出三百六十六斤大米才能换回一百斤盐，通车后有二百五十四斤大米就能换到；通车前要卖出一千一百斤大米才能换到一百斤白糖，现在只要七百斤就行了。据统计，成渝铁路通车后，成都有三千多种工业品价格普遍降低。而川西平原农民的副产品的价格却因成渝铁路通车大大地提高了。通车前卖出一斤烟叶只能换回一斤盐，通车后，一斤烟叶卖出后可以买到三斤盐；过去成都附近农民要卖出十五斤烟叶才能换回一个竹壳热水瓶，通车后，只要六斤烟叶就能换到一个竹壳热水瓶了。这就大大刺激了川西平原农土特产品的大量增产。大麻在过去从未外销过，通车前已滞积五十多万斤，通车后马上销天津一万八千担，销上海六千担。金堂县的水果也能远销上海、武汉了。
    成渝铁路通车后，大量地供应了川西平原的农业生产资料。火车从华东、华北运来大批豆饼肥料、大量杀虫药剂、器械。像新繁龙桥乡合作社，不到一个月，就供应了秋种生产资料的葫豆一万二千斤，大粪、骨粉六千多斤；绵阳七区合作社九月六日一天就卖出铁铧一百四十八只。这样就给川西平原农村的爱国增产运动提供了有利的条件。
