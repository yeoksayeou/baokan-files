    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 29th: Since the vast number of farmers have enthusiastically sold surplus grain and paid agricultural taxes to the state, the amount of grain stored by grain departments in the Central South region has greatly exceeded that of previous years since the beginning of this winter. To this end, in addition to building new grain warehouses, grain departments in various parts of the Central South region have recently renovated a large number of ancestral halls, temples, or public houses to serve as state grain warehouses. In Guangdong Province's main grain-producing area, the Yuezhong District alone has renovated warehouses capable of holding more than 280 million catties of grain. Before storing grain in rented civilian houses, the grain department of Xiangcheng County, Henan Province, also disinfects them and adds rice husks as padding.
    Recently, grain departments in various parts of the Central South region have successively transferred full-time personnel to prevent and test grain for insects, mold, heat, and dampness. The Grain Bureaus of the People's Governments of Guangdong and Hubei provinces have also stipulated that grain prevention and testing personnel must inspect grassroots grain warehouses in rotation, at least once every three days. The Guangdong Provincial Grain Bureau has increased the number of temporary storage personnel and organized grain prevention and testing personnel to inspect the clean and sanitary system of grain warehouses in Yuezhong and Yuexi and to promote the Soviet Union's advanced experience of using vibrating screens to remove insects. The Central South Grain Administration has instructed all localities to establish a "semi-monthly prevention and chemical communication system" to promptly exchange information and experience on grain storage in various places. The Hunan Provincial Grain Bureau sent people to Zhejiang Province to learn from Yu Hang County's experience of "insect-free grain warehouses" and to North China and Northeast China to learn from the experience of storing miscellaneous grains. Grassroots grain departments in Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces have begun to inspect the new grain entering the warehouses and use the dry winter monsoon to turn and dry the grain. The Grain Department of Nanchang County, Jiangxi Province, has universally inspected the grain warehouses and carried out the necessary turning and drying. After the grain storage personnel in Shangqiu City, Henan Province, turned, spread, and fumigated various stored grains, they basically achieved safe storage. In areas where grain is being purchased, some have adopted the method of screening and sorting grain while purchasing it before it enters the warehouse for grain of poorer quality.
    At present, grain storage in the Central South region is scattered throughout various places. Therefore, all localities are paying attention to relying on and organizing local village cadres to protect grain warehouses. The grain stored in Sanxin Township, Huarong County, on the shores of Dongting Lake, leaked during a stormy night. Zhang Zhuoyan, the township head, inspected the warehouse all night and used his own quilt to cover the rain, ensuring that the millet was not damaged.
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan: In order to facilitate the majority of farmers to reserve production funds for next year after selling grain, the People's Banks at all levels in the Central South region are vigorously carrying out preferential fixed-term and fixed-amount savings for grain sales.
    The Central South Branch and provincial branches of the People's Bank of China have made full preparations and instructed local banking departments to regard this work as one of the central tasks at present, requiring that, under the unified leadership of local Party and government organs, they first do a good job in publicity, mobilization, and organization. At the same time, they should pay special attention to the demands of farmers and proceed from "convenience for farmers to deposit and withdraw" to specifically arrange savings business. Now, People's Banks in various counties have added many "savings points" in rural areas and market towns, or specially sent cadres to rural areas to handle savings business on tour. Some areas have entrusted this business to cooperatives and grain purchase teams to handle it on their behalf. The People's Bank of Hanshou County, Hunan Province, alone has organized 47 groups to go to the countryside to handle savings business. The Henan Provincial People's Bank sent 158 cadres to the countryside to assist in the work. After selling surplus grain, farmers in Poyang and Dongxiang counties in Jiangxi Province deposited nearly 8 billion yuan into banks in mid-December. When discussing the use of money from selling grain, farmers in Guanxian Township, Yicheng County, Hubei Province, realized the benefits of savings for the country and themselves and learned that the procedures for depositing and withdrawing money were very simple, so they enthusiastically saved. The total savings in the township has reached 65.95 million yuan, accounting for 35.2 percent of the money earned from selling grain in the township. In Dashi Lou Village, Shangqiu County, Henan Province, on the 16th, 55 farmers sold more than 26 million yuan of grain, of which 52 households deposited more than 14 million yuan into the bank. They said: "Putting money in the bank allows you to take it out whenever you need it. It is convenient and patriotic, and it saves you from spending the money piecemeal if you keep it on hand."

    中南区加强粮食保管工作
    优待售粮储蓄工作正在农村中积极展开
    【新华社武汉二十九日电】由于广大农民踊跃向国家出售余粮和缴纳农业税，今年冬季开始以来，中南区粮食部门储存的粮食已大大超过往年。为此，中南区各地粮食部门除了新建粮食仓库外，近来又整修了大批祠堂、庙宇或公共房屋，代作国家粮食仓库。仅广东省主要产粮区——粤中区就整修了可容纳二亿八千多万斤的仓库。河南襄城县粮食部门租用的民房在装粮食之前，还进行消毒和加垫谷糠。
    中南各地粮食部门近来纷纷调配防治和化验粮食虫、霉、热、潮的专职工作人员。广东和湖北两省人民政府粮食厅并规定粮食防治化验人员必须轮回检查基层粮食仓库，至迟三天轮流检查一次。广东省粮食厅增加了一批临时保管人员，还组织了粮食防治化验人员到粤中、粤西检查粮仓的清洁卫生制度和推广苏联的先进经验溜筛除虫法。中南粮食管理局已指示各地建立“半月防化通讯制度”，及时交流各地粮食保管情况和经验。湖南省粮食厅派人到浙江省学习了余杭县“无虫粮仓”经验，到华北、东北区学习了保管杂粮的经验。湖北、湖南、江西省的基层粮食部门已开始检查入库的新粮，并利用冬季干燥的季候风翻晒粮食。江西省南昌县粮食部门普遍检查了粮仓和加以必要的翻晒。河南商邱市的粮食保管人员把各种存粮分别加以翻晒、摊晒、熏蒸后，基本上做到了储粮安全。正在收购粮食的地区，对质量较差的粮食，有的已在入库前采取一边收购、一边风筛整理的办法。
    当前中南区存粮分散各地，因此各地都注意依靠和组织当地乡村干部保护粮仓。存放在洞庭湖滨华容县三新乡的粮食，在一个暴风雨的夜里仓库漏雨了，该乡乡长张卓炎就整夜检查仓库，并把自己的被絮拿去遮雨，保全了谷子未受损失。
    【新华社武汉讯】中南区各级人民银行为便于广大农民卖粮后储备明年的生产资金，正大力开展优待售粮定期定额储蓄。
    中国人民银行中南区行和各省分行已作了充分的准备工作，并指示各地银行部门把这一工作作为当前的中心任务之一，要求在当地党、政机关的统一领导下，首先作好宣传动员和组织工作。同时特别要注意照顾农民的要求，从“农民存、取两便”出发，来具体安排储蓄业务。现在，各县人民银行都在农村、集镇增设了许多“储蓄点”，或专派干部下乡巡回办理储蓄业务。有些地区并把这一业务委托合作社、购粮组代办。仅湖南省汉寿县人民银行就组织了四十七个小组，下乡办理储蓄业务。河南省人民银行派出一百五十八名干部下乡协助工作。江西省鄱阳、东乡两县的农民，卖出余粮以后，十二月中旬已向银行储蓄近八十亿元。湖北省宜城县关贤乡农民在讨论卖粮钱款的用途时，认识到储蓄对国家对自己的好处，并了解到存款、取款的手续都很简便，因而踊跃储蓄。全乡储蓄额已达到六千五百九十五万元，占全乡卖粮所得钱数的百分之三十五点二。河南省商邱县大史楼村在十六日一天中，有五十五户农民卖粮两千六百多万元，其中五十二户存入银行的钱就有一千四百多万元。他们说：把钱存到银行可以啥时用啥时取，又方便又爱国，省得把钱放在手下零打碎敲地花掉了。
