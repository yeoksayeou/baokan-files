State-Owned Farms Play an Advanced Role
Increased Grain Production and Reduced Costs

    The more than 420 mu of wheat, rice, cotton, and other crops planted by the Fengyang County Farm in Anhui Province this year have seen an average yield increase of over 30% per mu compared to last year. The farm's actual total income increased by about 45% compared to last year, while production costs decreased by over 20%. The land of the Fengyang County Farm is the worst in the entire county. Through the efforts of the farm's employees over the past three years, the farm's output has surpassed that of local farmers. However, the farm's production costs were too high. This year, the farm made many improvements in its management and operations, and finally gradually reduced costs. This year, the number of administrative staff was reduced from seven to four; at the same time, a system of fixed personnel, fixed quotas, regional responsibility, and overproduction bonuses was implemented, which increased the labor efficiency of workers by more than 20%. All kinds of crops on the farm have been deeply ploughed and carefully cultivated, using more than 1,700 additional workdays compared to last year. Due to raising pigs to accumulate manure, digging pond mud, and composting green manure, the cost of purchasing commercial fertilizers was greatly reduced. This year, wheat yielded more than 170 jin per mu, an increase of 90% compared to last year, exceeding the yield of local farmers this year by two times. Now, the Fengyang County Farm has truly begun to become a banner for agricultural production in the county. During this year's autumn planting season, many agricultural production mutual aid and cooperative organizations from fifty or sixty li away sent representatives to the farm to observe the close planting of wheat and to exchange for improved seeds from the farm.

Able to Hand Over More Than 100 Million Yuan in Profits to the State

    The Pingzhuang Farm in Kalaqin Banner, Rehe Province, has further improved its farming techniques and management this year, basically achieving lower costs, reduced waste, and increased output. This year, due to the use of new agricultural implements, the selection of improved varieties, the implementation of close planting, and rational fertilization, the output of crops at the Pingzhuang Farm increased by 74.3% compared to last year's actual output. The Pingzhuang Farm has established a system of dedicated responsibility, with cadres specializing in finance, technology, operations management, and storage, and coordinating with each other. The land is divided into five operational areas, and the workers are divided into five groups, each group responsible for cultivating for three years. These dedicated responsibility systems have strengthened the sense of responsibility of the employees, instilling in them a long-term construction and ownership mentality. For example, the workers in the fourth group actively removed the tree roots, grass clumps, and uncultivated borders from the fields that had been there for many years, and planted crops. Responsible cadres personally went to the fields to guide technology, monitor operation times, and check the quantity and quality of work. Accountants, warehouse keepers, drivers, and shepherds all fulfilled their own responsibilities, reducing waste and eliminating the phenomenon of no one being responsible. Because the Pingzhuang Farm has annual, seasonal, and temporary plans, it has overcome blindness in production, allowing everyone to be clear about the situation. The farm also appropriately allocated labor according to the production progress of each group, avoiding idleness and delays in production. The farm paid particular attention to the cost calculation of various crops, thereby discovering problems in production and resolving them in a timely manner. Due to improved management and operations, the farm saved 10,237,000 yuan in expenditures in the first half of the year alone, and this year it will be able to hand over more than 110 million yuan in profits to the state. In addition, the farm carried out demonstration and promotion work in six villages, including Shiernao, providing great assistance to farmers in techniques such as seed selection and fertilization.

Helping Farmers Gradually Increase Production

    The Pudong Duhang District Farm in Shanghai County is a small state-owned farm. It has established prestige among the nearby farmers in less than two years since its establishment. After the establishment of the farm, the farm staff not only publicized the nature and role of the farm to the farmers, but also paid special attention to publicizing every production measure of the farm to the farmers. In the past two years, the farm has held two training classes for cotton farmers' activists. The labor contracts signed by the farm and 25 mutual aid groups in five villages, including Zhugang and Zhangxing, not only solved the problem of surplus labor in the mutual aid groups and the problem of temporary hiring on the farm, but also established a technology promotion network for the farm. Wang Bosheng, the village chief and mutual aid group leader of Xieqiao Village, lacked experience in growing improved cotton in the past and had low yields. Since becoming a temporary worker at the farm, he learned while working at the farm and passed on his knowledge to others when he returned to the mutual aid group, imitating the farm's practices. Last year, the farm paid great attention to rational fertilization, pruning, topping, and pest control when planting improved cotton, with an average yield of 185 jin per mu, exceeding the yield of local farmers' cotton fields by 40%. Due to the demonstration role of the farm, the area planted with improved cotton in the rural areas near the farm has increased significantly this year. In the three townships of Duhang, Shuiyue, and Binpu alone, more than 11,000 mu have been planted with improved cotton, more than double that of last year. In terms of technology, farmers near the farm are also actively learning from the farm. This year, the farm harvested more than 230 jin of cotton per mu, and the improved cotton fields of farmers in nearby Shuiyue Township also yielded an average of about 160 jin per mu. The farmers, seeing that the yield of cotton on the farm has always been higher than their own, and that the yield of their own cotton has gradually increased under the guidance of the farm, all said: "The farm is ultimately run by the state, with new methods and many talents. In the future, we must learn from the farm and follow the farm!"

Reversed the Thinking of Mountain Area Residents

    The land of the Caicun Branch of the Yangqu County Farm in Shanxi Province is mountainous land with a very steep slope. The soil here is barren, and the masses used to feel that the yield of such land was small and were unwilling to cultivate it. This year, the farm raised the low-lying parts of the mountainous land and lowered the high parts, built terraced fields, planted wheat, millet, broomcorn millet, beans, and yams, planted good varieties of apple trees, and sowed 169 mu of alfalfa grass. Since the establishment of the farm in the spring, the farm's employees have paid attention to giving play to the role of collective labor, rationally using labor and animal power, and implementing land preparation, fine cultivation, and moisture conservation; in order not to increase production costs, the employees worked together to dig grass turf and black soil and loess to use as fertilizer, ensuring that the land was not short of fertilizer; in addition, they paid attention to selecting good varieties, sowing in a timely manner, and implementing appropriate close planting and pest control. As a result, the farm achieved a bumper harvest, with an average yield of 126 jin of crops per mu, exceeding the yield of local farmers by more than 44%. The fact that the farm increased production greatly reversed the thinking of local farmers who abandoned land and did not cultivate it, and set an example for improving cultivation techniques. Farmer Xing Zheyun said after seeing the fact that the farm could also produce more grain on mountainous land: "The grain produced by the farm on the mountainous land this year is also more than what we produce on the land below the mountains. Now I know that without technology, the old-fashioned farming methods will not work. Next year, I have to learn from the farm." Shi Huizhi said: "My 11 mu of mountainous land can't produce much grain every year, and I didn't want to cultivate it for a long time. This year, I saw that the farm's wheat yielded more than 100 jin, and I can't bear not to cultivate it anymore." In planting fruit trees, the farm also paid attention to technology, and most of the more than 900 apple trees planted survived. As a result, the masses also reversed the thinking that fruit trees could not be planted on the mountainous land here, and they asked the farm to help them plant apple trees next year.

Mutual Teaching and Learning with the Masses

    The average yield per mu of autumn fields at the Yichuan County Demonstration and Propagation Farm in Shaanxi Province this year was 450 jin, 33% higher than the general yield in the area. Six mu of high-yield millet yielded 500 jin per mu, and 5.8 mu of corn yielded 900 jin per mu. Paying attention to employee education and maintaining close contact with the masses are the main reasons for the farm's achievements in production. The workers on the farm were originally local farmers. This year, as soon as the farm was established, the leaders of the farm explained to them the nature of the farm and the role of state-owned farms in the country's agricultural construction. The farm insisted on conducting political, cultural, and technical education for its employees every night, based on the agricultural season, specific work on the farm, and the workers' thoughts. For example, during the busy summer production season, the farm organized the workers to learn about the stories of the heroic battles of the Volunteers on the front lines, in order to boost the workers' morale and strive to complete the summer harvest plan as soon as possible. In the cultivation process, the farm led the workers to learn advanced technologies such as close planting, seedling thinning, and inter-row detasseling of hybrid corn. In this way, the workers greatly improved their enthusiasm for production and work efficiency. The farm also invited local production experts, labor models, and representatives of mutual aid groups, together with the personnel of the agricultural technology guidance station, to organize a technical research group to exchange farming experiences inside and outside the farm. When planting winter wheat this year, the research group specially organized the farm's employees to learn the technology of seed drilling from the skilled seed drillers among the masses. At the same time, they also taught the masses the farm's experience in wheat strip planting, seed treatment with pesticides, and other techniques. The farm has organized a total of four such exchanges of experience this year.

    国营农场发挥了先进作用
    增产了粮食，又降低了成本
    安徽省凤阳县农场今年播种的四百二十多亩小麦、水稻、棉花等作物，平均每亩比去年增产三成以上。全场实际总收入比去年增加百分之四十五左右，生产成本比去年减少百分之二十以上。凤阳县农场的土地是全县最不好的土地。三年来，经过农场职工的努力，农场的产量已高于当地农民，但是，农场的生产成本太高。今年农场在经营管理上作了很多改进，终于逐步降低了成本。今年，全场行政管理人员从原来的七个减少到四个；同时实行了定员定额、分区负责、超产奖励的制度，使工人劳动效率提高了百分之二十以上。全场各种作物都经过深耕细作，比去年多用一千七百多个工。由于养猪积肥、挖塘泥、沤绿肥等，购买商品肥料的费用便大大减少。今年小麦每亩收了一百七十多斤，比去年增产九成，超过当地农民今年产量的两倍。现在，凤阳县农场已真正开始成为全县农业生产的旗帜。今年秋种时，许多五六十里以外的农业生产互助合作组织都派代表来农场参观小麦密植，并向农场调换良种。
    能向国家上缴利润一亿多元
    热河省喀喇沁旗平庄农场今年进一步改进了耕作技术，改善了经营管理，基本上做到了降低成本、减少浪费、提高产量。平庄农场今年由于用新式农具耕种，选用了优良品种，实行密植，合理施肥等，使农作物的产量比去年实产量增加了百分之七十四点三。平庄农场建立了专责制，干部中有财务、技术、经营管理、保管等专责分工，并作到了相互配合。土地划分为五个作业区，工人分五个组，每组负责耕种三年。这些专责制都加强了职工的责任心，使职工树立了长期建设和主人翁思想。如第四组工人主动把多年来地里的树根子、草盘子、荒界子都挖掉，种上了庄稼。负责干部亲自到地里指导技术、掌握作业时间，检查工作数量和质量，会计、保管、车夫、羊倌都各负自己的责任，使农场减少了浪费，消灭了无人负责现象。平庄农场因为有常年、季节和临时计划，克服了生产上的盲目性，使大家心中有数，场里并按各组生产进度，适当调配劳动力，避免了窝工和耽误生产现象。该场特别重视各种作物的成本计算，由此发现生产中存在的问题，并及时予以解决。由于经营管理改善，该场开支中，只在上半年就节省了一亿零二百三十七万元，今年能给国家上缴利润一亿一千多万元。此外，该场在什二脑等六个村进行了示范推广工作，在选种、施肥等技术上，都对农民有很大帮助。
    帮助农民逐渐提高产量
    上海县浦东杜行区农场，是一个小型国营农场。它成立以来不到两年，就在附近农民中建立了威信。农场成立后，农场工作人员除了向农民宣传农场的性质和作用外，还特别注意把农场每一个生产措施都向农民宣传，两年来农场曾举办了两次棉农积极分子训练班。农场和竹岗、张行等五村二十五个互助组订立的劳动合约，一方面解决了互助组剩余劳动力的问题和农场临时雇工的问题，另
  一方面也由此建立了农场的技术推广网。斜桥村村长兼互助组长王伯生过去对种改良棉缺乏经验，产量不高，自到农场做临时工以后，在农场里边做边学，回到互助组里就传授给其他的人，也仿照农场这样做。农场去年种改良棉，十分注意合理施肥、整枝、摘心和防治虫害，每亩平均产量一百八十五斤，超过当地农民棉田产量百分之四十。由于农场起了示范作用，今年农场附近农村种改良棉的田都显著增加，只杜行、水月、滨浦等三乡，即种改良棉一万一千多亩，比去年增加了一倍多。在技术上，农场附近农民也都积极向农场学习。今年农场每亩棉花收了二百三十多斤，附近水月乡农民的改良棉田，平均每亩也产了一百六十斤左右。农民看了农场棉花的产量一直比自己的高，自己的棉花在农场指导下产量也逐渐提高，都说：“农场究竟是国家办的，办法新，人材多，今后还要好好向农场学习，跟农场走！”
    扭转了山地群众的思想
    山西省阳曲县农场蔡村支场的地是坡度很大的山坡地。这里土质瘠薄，群众过去觉得这样的地产量小，都不愿意种。今年农场在这里把山地起高垫低，修了梯田，种了麦子、糜子、谷子、豆类和山药，栽植了好品种的苹果树，又播种苜蓿草一百六十九亩。该场职工从春天建场起，就注意发挥集体劳动的作用，合理运用劳畜力，实行整修土地、精耕细耙、保墒的工作；为了不增加生产成本，职工合力刨草皮黑土和塄土作肥料，保证了土地不缺肥；另外，并注意选优良品种，适时下种，实行了适当密植和除虫。结果，该场获得了丰收，每亩庄稼平均产量一百二十六斤，超过当地群众产量百分之四十四强。农场增产的事实，大大扭转了当地农民弃地不种的思想，并为改进耕作技术树立了榜样。农民邢哲云看到农场在山地上也能多打粮的事实后说：“今年农场在山地打的粮，也比咱们山下的地打得多，现在我可知道了，不讲技术，老一套的耕作法可吃不开了，明年得跟农场学习。”史会只说：“我那十一亩山地年年打不了几颗粮食，早就不想种了，今年看见农场的麦子打了一百多斤，我又舍不得不种了。”在栽果树上，农场也讲求了技术，栽的苹果树九百多株，大部分都成活了。群众由此也扭转了这里山地不能栽果树的思想，纷纷要求农场明年帮助他们栽苹果树。　（刘稼生）
    和群众互教互学
    陕西省宜川县示范繁殖农场，今年秋田平均每亩产量四百五十斤，高出当地一般产量百分之三十三，有六亩丰产谷子每亩产量达五百斤，有五亩八分玉米每亩产量达九百斤。重视职工教育，和群众密切联系，是该场在生产上取得成绩的主要原因。该场工人，原来都是当地的农民。今年场子一成立，场的领导方面，就给他们讲解农场的性质和国营农场在国家农业建设上的作用。该场根据农业季节、场内具体工作和工人思想，每晚都坚持对职工进行政治或文化、技术教育。例如在夏季生产紧张时，就组织工人学习志愿军在前线英勇作战的故事，以鼓舞工人情绪，争取早日完成夏收计划。在耕作过程中，场内就领导工人学习密植、定苗、玉米隔行去雄杂交等先进技术。这样，工人在生产中大大提高了生产热情和工作效率。该场并和农业技术指导站人员，共同邀请当地生产能手、劳动模范和互助组长代表，组织了技术研究小组，交流场内外耕作经验。在今年种冬麦时，研究小组专门组织场内职工向群众摇耧能手学习了摇耧技术，同时，又把场内小麦条播密植、药剂拌种等经验教给群众。像这样的经验交流，该场在今年共已组织了四次。
