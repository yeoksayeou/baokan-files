Xinhua News Agency, December 19th: A large-scale propaganda campaign for the grassroots election movement in the capital has been widely launched, and people from all walks of life are welcoming the general election with a high degree of patriotism.

　　The capital in winter presents a festive atmosphere. The streets are full of attractive colored propaganda posters and eye-catching slogans for the general election. Many institutions and schools have put on festive decorations at their entrances; shop windows have also been ingeniously decorated. Crowds of people are constantly flocking to the propaganda stations in various districts, where various propaganda posters for the general election are displayed, and there are many inspiring literary and artistic performances. The Qianmen District Propaganda Station had more than 12,000 visitors in six days. Recently, more than 2,000 reporters have been publicizing the election law to the people; many reporters have connected the importance of carrying out the general election with the realization of the general line and general tasks of the state during the transition period. At the same time, they also narrated the great achievements made in all aspects of the capital in the past four years under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government. These reports have deeply moved people's hearts. In the propaganda campaign, more than 2,000 literary and art workers in the city have also become active, and dozens of small-scale performances to promote the general election are held in the city every day. Many heads of state organs have personally reported on the general election to the cadres of their organs, and many units have also conducted special studies and discussions. Students from more than 40 ethnic minorities in China who are studying at the Central Institute for Nationalities have also actively participated in the study of the election law. In order to enable students to study better, the school has also prepared election law documents printed in five ethnic languages: Han, Uyghur, Kazakh, Mongolian, and Tibetan.

　　The extensive propaganda campaign has given the people of the capital a profound democratic and patriotic education. Worker Song Baoshan said excitedly after listening to the report: "The general election is a major event. In the past, when the political power was in the hands of the reactionaries, we couldn't get enough to eat or wear; now that the people have seized political power, I get 260 points a month, and my family of four has enough to eat and wear! I must let my family and relatives know about this solemn event of the general election." Ma Mengmin, a 70-year-old Hui resident living near Taoranting, said: "The minority nationalities live so well under the leadership of Chairman Mao. I am over seventy years old and have never seen such a thing!" After the propaganda, many people realized the great significance of implementing the general election for the implementation of the general line and general tasks of the state during the transition period. Many factories and schools have launched a wave of celebrating the general election with practical actions. The Pang Chengyuan group of the 74th workshop of the Beijing People's Printing Factory has created an unprecedented record of reducing the scrap rate by 99% in order to welcome the general election. The 21st workshop of the factory used 381 kinds of waste materials in November to save the country 20 million yuan. They decided to use more waste materials in December to accumulate funds to celebrate the arrival of the general election. The workers of Xinhua Printing Factory, who had completed the state plan for the whole year 32 days ahead of schedule, proposed to celebrate the general election by completing the year's production increase and economy plan five days ahead of schedule. The workers of the Beijing People's Leather Sports Goods Factory, who completed the state task as early as November 21, had more than 80% of the groups proposing congratulatory plans for the general election in one day. Teachers and students of Tsinghua University, Beijing Normal University and other schools have also expressed their willingness to celebrate the general election with practical actions. Li Youshan, director of the Department of Mechanical Engineering of Tsinghua University, said: "We are now following the Soviet road and using advanced Soviet teaching methods to train talents. I guarantee to conscientiously complete the task and celebrate the general election by improving the quality of teaching."

    首都广泛展开大规模的普选宣传工作
   【新华社十九日讯】首都基层选举运动大规模的宣传工作已广泛展开，各阶层人民正以高度的爱国主义热情迎接普选。
    冬日的首都，出现了一片节日的气氛。街道上到处是吸引人的彩色普选宣传画和醒目的标语。许多机关和学校的门口，换上了节日的装饰；商店的橱窗也被人们精巧地布置起来。成群结队的人群不断涌到各区宣传站去，那里陈列着各种普选宣传画，有许多鼓舞人心的文艺节目的演出。前门区宣传站在六天内就有一万二千多人去参观。近日来，两千多个报告员正纷纷向人民宣传选举法；许多报告员在报告中联系了实现国家在过渡时期总路线总任务来说明进行普选工作的重要性。他们同时还叙述了首都四年来在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下所取得的各方面的伟大成就。这些报告都深深地打动了人心。在宣传运动中，市内二千多个文艺工作者也活跃起来，全市每天都有几十个宣传普选的小型演出会。许多国家机关的负责人亲自向本机关的干部进行了普选的报告，许多单位并进行了专门学习和讨论。正在中央民族学院学习的我国四十多个少数民族的学生，也积极参加了选举法的学习。为了使学生们更好地学习，该校并准备了用汉、维吾尔、哈萨克、蒙、藏等五个民族文字印行的选举法文件。
    广泛的宣传运动，给首都人民一次深刻的民主教育和爱国主义的教育。工人宋宝善听报告后激动地说：“普选是大事，过去政权掌握在反动派手里，我们吃不饱，穿不暖；现在人民掌握了政权，我一人一个月就拿二百六十分，全家四口吃饱穿暖了！普选这件庄严的事，我一定要让家里人和亲戚全知道。”居住在陶然亭附近七十多岁的回民马蒙民说：“少数民族在毛主席领导下生活得太好了，我七十多岁从来没有见过有这样的事！”经过宣传后，许多人认识了实行普选对于贯彻国家在过渡时期总路线总任务的重大意义。许多工厂、学校掀起了以实际行动庆祝普选的热潮。北京人民印刷厂七四车间庞承元小组，为迎接普选已经创造了降低作废率指标百分之九十九的空前纪录。该厂二一车间在十一月份利用三百八十一种废料，为国家节约了二千万元，他们决定十二月份更多利用废料，积累资金，庆贺普选的到来。已经提前三十二天完成全年国家计划的新华印刷厂的工人们，提出了要以提前五天完成全年增产节约计划来庆祝普选。早在十一月二十一日就完成国家任务的北京人民制革体育用品厂的工人，在一天当中曾有百分之八十多的小组提出了庆祝普选的献礼计划。清华大学、北京师范大学以及其他学校的师生们，也纷纷表示要以实际行动来庆祝普选。清华大学机械制造系主任李酉山说：“我们现在是走的苏联的道路，用苏联先进教学方法来培养人材。我保证切实地完成任务，以提高教学质量来庆贺普选。”
