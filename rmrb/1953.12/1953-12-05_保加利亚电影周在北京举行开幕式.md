    Xinhua News Agency: The opening ceremony of the "People's Republic of Bulgaria Film Week," sponsored by the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, was held in Beijing on the evening of the 4th. More than 1,200 people attended the opening ceremony, including Zhou Yang, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, Zhang Xiruo, Minister of Education, Qian Junrui, Secretary-General of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council, Xu Xuehan, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade, Zeng Zhaolun, Vice Minister of Higher Education, Liu Shi, Vice Minister of Education, and Yan Baohang, Deputy Director of the General Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Invited to attend the opening ceremony were Petkov, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the People's Republic of Bulgaria to China, and diplomatic envoys and officials from various countries stationed in China.

    Zhou Yang, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, spoke at the opening ceremony. He said: As early as twenty years ago, we introduced Bulgarian literary works. We know that the Bulgarian people have revolutionary traditions. The great communist, the founder and leader of the Bulgarian Communist Party, Dimitrov, is well-known and admired by the working class all over the world. In the past thirty years, the Bulgarian working class, under the leadership of Dimitrov and the Bulgarian Communist Party, has carried out unyielding struggles. The Bulgarian people, under the leadership of Dimitrov and his successor Chervenkov, have begun the great task of socialist construction after seizing power. Through the films to be shown during the film week, we can not only further understand the development and achievements of our brotherly country, but also learn from them well. These films can also encourage the working people of our country to strive to fully realize the general line of our country's transition period.

    Ambassador Petkov was invited to speak. The Ambassador said: This film week will deepen and expand the cultural exchanges between our two countries and help strengthen the fraternal friendship between the people of the two countries. The opening day of the film week also coincides with the sixth anniversary of the implementation of the Constitution of the People's Republic of Bulgaria. The Ambassador described the brilliant achievements of the People's Republic of Bulgaria under the guarantee of the Dimitrov Constitution in consolidating the people's victory and in economic and cultural construction. After emphasizing the achievements of the Bulgarian film industry, the Ambassador said: Bulgarian audiences have been fortunate enough to watch Chinese films with excitement in Bulgarian cinemas. In a few days, the Chinese Film Week will also be held in Bulgaria, and our people will better understand the long-term and heroic struggle of the Chinese people against feudalism and imperialism and the great achievements they have made in the liberated New China. Finally, the historical film "Under Oppression," depicting the national liberation struggle of the Bulgarian people, was shown. The film week will be held simultaneously in twenty major cities across the country starting on the 5th. It was originally planned to show three films, but now it has been decided to add the film "Under Oppression" (except for cities that cannot receive a copy of the film in time), which was translated by the Northeast Film Studio. This film is adapted from the novel of the same name by the famous Bulgarian writer Ivan Vazov, and it vividly depicts the heroic national liberation struggle of the Bulgarian people to free themselves from Turkish enslavement.

    保加利亚电影周在北京举行开幕式
    据新华社讯：中央人民政府文化部主办的“保加利亚人民共和国电影周”的开幕式四日晚在北京举行。参加开幕式的有：中央人民政府文化部副部长周扬、教育部部长张奚若、政务院文化教育委员会秘书长钱俊瑞、对外贸易部副部长徐雪寒、高等教育部副部长曾昭抡、教育部副部长柳湜、外交部办公厅副主任阎宝航等共一千二百多人。应邀参加开幕式的有保加利亚人民共和国驻我国特命全权大使彼得科夫和各国驻华使节及外交官员。
    中央文化部副部长周扬在开幕式上讲话。他说：早在二十年前，我们就介绍过保加利亚的文学作品。我们知道，保加利亚人民是具有革命传统的。伟大的共产主义者、保加利亚共产党的创立者和领导者季米特洛夫，是为全世界工人阶级所熟知和敬仰的。在最近三十年间，保加利亚的工人阶级曾在季米特洛夫和保加利亚共产党的领导下，进行了不屈不挠的斗争；保加利亚人民，在季米特洛夫和他的继承人契尔文科夫领导下，掌握了政权后即开始了社会主义建设的巨大工作。通过电影周中将要放映的影片，我们不仅可以更进一步地了解我们兄弟国家的发展和成就，而且可以很好地向他们学习；这些影片更可以鼓舞我国劳动人民为彻底实现我国过渡时期的总路线而奋斗。
    彼得科夫大使应邀讲话。大使说：这次电影周将使我们两国之间的文化交流更深入与扩展，并有助于加强两国人民之间的兄弟般的友谊；电影周开幕的日子，又恰逢保加利亚人民共和国宪法实施六周年纪念日。大使叙述了保加利亚人民共和国在季米特洛夫宪法的保障下，在巩固人民的胜利以及在经济建设和文化建设等方面所取得的辉煌成就。大使着重地叙述了保加利亚电影事业的成就后，又说：保加利亚的观众已经幸运地在保加利亚的电影院中以兴奋的心情看过了中国影片，过几天后中国电影周也将在保加利亚举行，我国人民将会更好地了解中国人民反对封建主义和帝国主义的长期英勇斗争以及他们在解放了的新中国所获得的伟大成就。最后，放映了保加利亚民族解放斗争历史故事片“在压迫下”。电影周五日起在全国二十个大城市同时举行。原定映出三部影片，现决定加映东北电影制片厂突击译制的“在压迫下”一片（除了因不能及时收到此片拷贝的城市以外）。此片是根据保加利亚著名作家伊凡·瓦佐夫所著同名小说改编制成的，它生动地描绘了保加利亚人民为争取摆脱土耳其的奴役而进行的英勇的民族解放斗争。
