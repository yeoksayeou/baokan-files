    Socialist Road is the Road to Common Prosperity for Peasants

    Editor's Note: This article is one of a series of articles entitled "Propagating the General Line to the Peasants" which was published by this newspaper in the previous days. Due to some reason, this article is published today. This series of articles (eight in total) will soon be published as a separate book by "Popular Reading Publishing House" and distributed nationwide.
    I. Two Roads
    The victory of the national revolution and the completion of land reform have brought great benefits to the peasants. The peasants have land and freedom, and are no longer oppressed and exploited by the Kuomintang bandit gangs and the landlord class; and with the leadership and care of the Communist Party and the People's Government, many of the difficulties in production and life have been solved. Therefore, in recent years, rural production has developed, the living standards of peasants have improved, and life is much better than in the old days.
    However, the peasants in the old days were too poor. Now, it is better than in the old days, but what does that count for? The life of the peasants is not prosperous enough now, and it is far behind the peasants in the Soviet Union. Moreover, if the peasants are always engaged in small-scale production like this, they will never be prosperous. Not only will they not be prosperous, but the lives of most peasants will encounter many difficulties, and they may even become poor peasants and farm laborers again.
    Why can't small-scale production lead to great prosperity? First, small-scale production is based on individual households, with weak manpower and limited labor force. There are many farm works to do, and they cannot take care of all of them. It is easy to miss the farming season and it is not easy to do the farm work well. Second, small-scale production means that each household owns a small piece of land. The land is too small to use larger and more expensive new-style farm implements, let alone machines; without new-style farm implements and machines, production cannot be greatly developed. Third, small producers have too few people, and the land is in small pieces, so they cannot use many new agricultural techniques (farming methods). Because, on the one hand, there are few people and a lot of work, so it is not easy to find time to learn agricultural techniques and culture; on the other hand, even if some larger-scale new technologies are learned, they cannot be used due to the small number of people and the small amount of land. Without the use of new technologies, production cannot be greatly developed. If agricultural production cannot be greatly developed, peasants will certainly not be prosperous.
    Then, if we continue as before, why will most peasants become poor? First, small-scale production cannot withstand natural disasters. If there is a natural disaster, such as floods, droughts, wind, frost, hail, or insects, no grain can be harvested from the fields, and these peasants will become poorer. At the same time, peasant small producers are also the least able to prevent natural disasters because of their weak strength. They do not have the ability to build water conservancy projects and plant trees to prevent floods, droughts, and wind disasters. If insects are born in the fields, they often do not have the power to control them. Therefore, natural disasters often come to the door of peasant small producers. Second, small-scale production cannot withstand man-made disasters. Diseases and deaths are always inevitable. Once such things happen, they require a lot of money and loss of labor. Because the peasants have a weak foundation, some families become poor. Third, small producers cannot withstand the exploitation of urban and rural capitalism. The rich peasants and usurers in the countryside, and the commercial capitalists in the cities, are the most capable of exploiting peasant small producers. For example, urban and rural merchants stir up trouble. If they manipulate the prices of grain, cotton, and other commodities, causing them to rise and fall, the peasants will suffer a great loss. For example, some peasants have to borrow money and grain because of natural disasters, man-made disasters, or other temporary needs. Once they borrow from usurers, they are in hell. The interest is high and rolls over quickly, and sooner or later, people will be exploited and become poor. Therefore, if small-scale production continues as before, over time, most peasants will become poor.
    From this, it seems that small producers cannot continue as before. Moreover, in fact, they will not continue as before. After the land reform, most peasants are better off than before, and many poor peasants have risen to become middle peasants. However, some individual peasants, after becoming richer, feel that it is not enough to live on the original land, so they are using methods such as speculative business, hoarding and reselling grain, and hiring workers to get rich. Of course, not everyone who wants to get rich in this way can really get rich. Only a very few people really become rich peasants. In addition, some individual peasants have become poorer. In Chafuxiang, Eighth District, Dongkou County, Hunan Province, 29 households have sold their land since the autumn of this year. This means that individual peasants are slowly moving towards the two extremes of wealth and poverty.
    Therefore, the status of small peasants is not stable, and in fact it has not been stable.
    There are only two roads in front of individual peasants: one is to develop towards socialism; the other is to develop towards capitalism. If you don't take the road of socialism, you have to take the road of capitalism. There is no third way.
    II. The Capitalist Road is the Road to Wealth for a Few and Poverty and Bankruptcy for the Vast Majority
    What is taking the capitalist road? Some comrades say: "As long as you have not joined the mutual aid team or cooperative, you are taking the capitalist road." This is certainly not right. Peasants who have not joined mutual aid teams or cooperatives have one eye on mutual aid teams and cooperatives, and the other eye on rich peasants, merchants, and usurers, wavering at the crossroads of these two roads. Although they have not joined mutual aid teams or cooperatives today, they may join tomorrow. However, they cannot stand at the crossroads for long. If they never join mutual aid teams or cooperatives, they will inevitably take the road of capitalism, which means that most people will become poor peasants and farm laborers, and a few people will become exploiters.
    In rural areas, capitalism means exploiting other people's labor by hiring workers, lending money at high interest rates (buying green crops is also a form of usury), or engaging in commerce. The rich peasants, usurers, and commercial capitalists in the countryside are engaged in such exploitative activities as hiring workers, lending money at high interest rates, and engaging in commerce. When we say that the countryside is taking the capitalist road, we mean that the countryside is gradually allowing these exploiters to gain power, and allowing the majority of peasants to be exploited by them.
    Peasants who do not join mutual aid teams and cooperatives for a long time, if they are relatively wealthy and have surplus grain and money in their hands, will often learn from the exploiters and engage in various exploitative activities. This kind of exploitative activity by peasants is what everyone often calls the spontaneous capitalist tendency. If a peasant initially engages in a few exploitative activities by chance and gains some profit, he will gradually become a regular exploiter. When the income he gets from exploitation becomes his important or main income, this peasant is no longer an ordinary peasant (middle peasant), but becomes a capitalist element such as a rich peasant, usurer, or merchant, a person who does not live by his own labor but by exploiting others.
    There are also many individual peasants who either do not have much surplus grain and money, or do not have the cunning mind to engage in business and exploitation, and even if they want to become rich peasants, they cannot. But they may also play a role in helping the countryside move towards capitalism, because these individual peasants are exactly the good targets of exploiters. You must know that without the exploited, the exploiters cannot get rich. It is difficult for merchants, usurers, and rich peasants to prey on peasants who have joined mutual aid and cooperation, but they can use the poverty of individual peasants to carry out various forms of exploitation; individual peasants are also easily deceived, for example, some peasants cannot resist the temptation of merchants and sell grain to them, resulting in cheapening the merchants and suffering great losses themselves. Therefore, the more individual peasants there are, the more convenient it is for the development of merchants, usurers, and rich peasants.
    It should be noted here: First, the hiring of workers (whether long-term or short-term) is different from the mutual aid of exchanging labor where you hire me and I hire you, and cannot be confused. Hiring workers is paying wages to buy other people's labor, but the labor is more and the wages are less, so it is a kind of exploitation, and it is capitalist exploitation; the mutual aid of exchanging labor, although sometimes it also uses the form of wages to exchange, but you hire me and I hire you, no one exploits anyone, so it is not exploitation, nor is it capitalist exploitation. Second, usury is different from mutual aid loans between peasants, and cannot be confused. Usury is lending grain or money and charging very high interest; mutual aid loans have no interest or only very little interest (how much interest counts as usury cannot be completely uniform for the time being due to different locations and time conditions). Current usury can also be said to be a kind of capitalist exploitation. Third, commerce is different from agricultural sidelines and handicrafts, and cannot be confused. Commerce is carried out through constantly buying and selling goods, and it does not produce anything. The money earned from commerce is the labor result of others, so it is a kind of exploitation; while agricultural sidelines and handicrafts rely on their own labor to obtain income, not exploitation. For example, if a peasant uses a donkey to transport goods (not doing business, but helping the state or cooperative to transport goods), the money he earns is exchanged for walking, carrying things, and other labor. That is labor, not exploitation.
    Taking the capitalist road is the road to wealth for a few and poverty and bankruptcy for the vast majority. For the vast majority of peasants, it is an extremely tragic and painful road, and it is harmful to the country and the people. Now, many peasants across the country have seen the danger of this road and are determined not to take this road. Only a part of the peasants, who have a little surplus grain and money in their hands, and whose land is good and livestock are strong, think that they are fully confident in getting rich by exploitation, and are rushing to the nests of rich peasants, usurers, and merchants. In fact, this is also unreliable. Can you climb to the status of rich peasants, usurers, and merchants just because you have a little surplus grain and money, good land and strong livestock? If you also scramble, and he also scrambles to get rich by exploitation, isn't that you pit me, and I earn you, big fish eat small fish, small fish eat shrimps, and after eating and eating, you may not be able to eat anyone clean! Even if you are lucky enough to climb to the position of rich peasants, usurers, and commercial capitalists, it is not only not glorious, but also has no way out in the end. As everyone knows, our China is bound to implement socialism. Capitalism in cities must be transformed into socialism. Can capitalism in rural areas continue to exist for a long time? Therefore, conscious working peasants must not take the capitalist road.
    III. The Socialist Road is the Road to Common Prosperity for Peasants
    Then, how can we avoid taking the capitalist road? The only way is to take the socialist road.
    What is socialism? In rural areas, socialism is that everyone unites, uses large-scale production and new farm implements, agricultural machinery, and new farming methods to manage agriculture, so that everyone can be prosperous together. That is to say: First, socialism is that the working people jointly own the means of production (land, large farm implements, large livestock, etc.), that is, the public ownership of the means of production. With the public ownership of the means of production, the phenomenon of people exploiting people will also disappear, because the publicly owned means of production are used to produce for everyone and to seek happiness for everyone. Second, socialist agriculture is large-scale production. Everyone unites to use new-style farm implements, agricultural machinery, and new farming methods to manage, so it is much larger in scale than the current agricultural production, and it is much more powerful to work together. Third, with the implementation of socialism, there is particularly more production, so everyone can be richer year by year, and in the future, everyone's life will be better than the life of today's rich peasants and the landlords of the past. Fourth, the socialist distribution method is "distribution according to labor." Whoever labors well and labors more gets more remuneration. People with labor power have no food to eat if they do not work. However, the orphaned, widowed, elderly, and weak can receive social care. Therefore, socialist society is the happiest and most glorious society.
    However, socialism will not come by itself. Everyone must work hard to build it, and it cannot be built successfully all at once. It must be developed step by step. How can we move towards a socialist society step by step? In rural areas, to take the socialist road, we must first participate in mutual aid teams with socialist embryonic nature, participate in semi-socialist agricultural production cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives, and credit cooperatives, and then we can transition to fully socialist agricultural production cooperatives (that is, collective farms).
    There is a step-by-step benefit to walking on the socialist road. The further you go, the greater the benefit.
    Why is there a step-by-step benefit to walking?
    From the point of view of the benefits to the peasants, on the one hand, mutual aid teams produce more than individual production, and agricultural production cooperatives produce more than mutual aid teams. According to a survey of seven agricultural production cooperatives in Sichuan Province: This year, the wheat they planted yielded an average of more than 16 percent more than local mutual aid teams and 34 percent more than individual peasants. This year, the Yusongchang Agricultural Production Cooperative in XinanTai Village, Fourth District, Wendeng County, Shandong Province, planted 38 mu of corn and harvested a total of 12,806 jin, averaging 337 jin per mu, which was 98 jin more than the average yield per mu of a local mutual aid team, and 105 jin more than the average yield per mu of corn in the whole village. This situation, of course, is not a special situation in Sichuan and Wendeng County, Shandong Province. It is almost the same everywhere. On the other hand, participating in mutual aid teams and cooperatives does not lead to the differentiation of peasants into two extremes of wealth and poverty like individual peasants. Peasants can all become prosperous together. If someone encounters any difficulties, they don't have to find a rich man for help, because everyone can help each other and think together, and they can also go to the credit cooperative to borrow money. At this time, even if a few people still want to continue to get rich by exploitation, it is difficult to find workers to hire, it is difficult to find borrowers to lend to, and if they want to do business, everyone goes to the supply and marketing cooperative, and no one pays attention to them, and it is difficult for them to continue to exploit. Therefore, developing mutual aid teams and cooperatives can not only avoid the differentiation of peasants and avoid taking the capitalist road, but also enable peasants to become prosperous together step by step, and finally reach a socialist society.
    The peasant's taking the socialist road is not only beneficial to the peasants, but also of great benefit to the whole country. Because, first, the country is being built, the urban population is increasing, and the population in areas that produce industrial crops such as cotton, tobacco, tea, silk, hemp, sugarcane, peanuts, sesame, beans, vegetables, and fruits, as well as animal husbandry areas, is also increasing, and the lives of the peasants are also better. The need for food and other agricultural products is growing. Only mutual aid and cooperation and increased production can meet the needs of the country and the people. Second, the country's economic construction is planned. There is a certain amount of cotton and grain needed nationwide. If there is too much, it is wasted, and if there is too little, it is not enough. The time required is also certain. What is needed in the spring will not work in the summer. This situation requires the peasants to have a plan, and the peasants can only set a plan after joining the cooperative. If the peasants do not use large-scale production and each family plants a small piece of land, it is not easy to set a plan, and the things produced are not easy to match the needs of the country, and the things produced by the country are not easy to match the needs of the peasants. Whether there is too much or too little, the peasants and the country will suffer. In short, only when peasants embark on the socialist road can they be able to cooperate with the needs of industrialization in a planned way. When industry develops, it can supply peasants with new-style farm implements and various agricultural machines. With machines, peasants can become richer and richer, and their lives will become happier and happier.
    The Communist Party and Chairman Mao want to lead the people of the whole country to take the socialist road, and the peasants must always follow the Communist Party and Chairman Mao to take this road.

    社会主义的路是农民共同富裕的路
    郭小川
    编者按：这篇文章是本报前些天连续刊载的“向农民宣传总路线”的一批文章中的一篇，因故延至今日发表。这批文章（共八篇）即将由“通俗读物出版社”出版单行本，在全国发行。
    一、两条路
    全国革命胜利，土地改革完成，给农民带来很大的好处。农民有了土地、有了自由，再不受国民党匪帮和地主阶级的压迫剥削了；而且有了共产党和人民政府的领导和关心，有了工人兄弟的援助，在生产上生活上的困难有许多都得到了解决。所以，这几年来，农村生产发展了，农民生活水平提高了，日子比旧时代好过多了。
    可是，旧时代的农民太苦了，现在比旧时代好一些，那算得了什么呢？现在农民的生活还算不得富裕，比苏联的农民还差得远呢。而且，如果农民老是现在这样子的小生产，是永远不能大富裕的，不但不能大富裕，而且大多数农民的生活还会发生很多困难，甚至重新变为贫农雇农。
    小生产为什么不能大富裕呢？第一、小生产是一家一户为单位，人力单薄，劳动力有限，而农活很多，顾不过来，既容易误了农时，又不容易把农活做好。第二、小生产是一家一户占有一小块土地，土地太少，不能使用较大较贵的新式农具，更不能使用机器；不能使用新式农具和机器，生产就不能有很大的发展。第三、小生产者人手太少，土地又是一小块一小块的，就不能利用许多新的农业技术（农作法）。因为，一方面，人少活多，不容易找出功夫来学农业技术、学文化；另方面，有好些规模较大的新技术就是学了也因人少地少用不上。不能使用新技术，生产就不能有很大的发展。农业生产不能有大的发展，农民当然就不能大富裕。
    那么，要是照老样过下去，为什么大多数农民还会贫困呢？第一、小生产经不起天灾，如果一闹天灾，水、旱、风、霜、雹、虫，田里地里打不出粮食来，这些农民就要穷下去。同时，农民小生产者又因力量单薄，最不能防止天灾。他们没有能力兴修水利、种树造林来防水灾、旱灾、风灾，田里生了虫，也常常没有力量来除治，所以，天灾是常常要找上农民小生产者的大门来的；第二、小生产也经不起人祸。疾病死亡总是难免的，一出了这样的事，既要用大量的钱，又要丧失劳动力，这样，因为农民底子薄，有些人家就这样穷下来了；第三、小生产者经不起城乡资本主义的剥削。乡村里的富农、高利贷者，城市里的商业资本家，都是最会盘剥农民小生产者的。比如，城乡的商人，兴风作浪，要是把粮价、棉价和别的物价弄得一涨一落，农民就要吃大亏。又比如，有的农民因为天灾人祸或有了其他临时需要，必须借钱借粮，一借到高利贷者的门上，就算进了地狱了，利又大，滚得又快，一来二去，把人剥削穷了。所以，小生产如果照老样子过下去，时间久了，大多数农民就会穷困起来。
    由此看来，小生产者是不能照老样子过下去的。而且，事实上也不会照老样过下去。土地改革以后，大多数农民都比从前好过了，有不少贫农上升到中农。可是，有些单干农民富裕一些之后，就感到靠原来那点土地过日子不够味了，所以正在用做投机生意、囤粮倒粮、雇工等办法来发财致富。当然，想用这种办法发财致富的人并不是个个真能发财致富，只有极少数人真的变成了富农。另外有一部分单干农民却穷了下来。湖南省洞口县第八区茶辅乡，在今年入秋以来就有二十九户卖了田。这就是说，单干农民已经在慢慢地分头向贫富两方面走。
    所以说，小农的地位是不能稳定的，事实上它也没有稳定。
    摆在个体农民面前的只有两条路：一条路是向社会主义发展；另一条路是向资本主义发展。不走社会主义的路，就要走资本主义的路，第三条路是没有的。
    二、资本主义的路是少数人发财、绝大多数贫穷破产的路
    怎样是走资本主义的路呢？有的同志说：“只要你没有参加互助组、合作社，就是走资本主义的路。”这话当然是不对的。没有参加互助组、合作社的农民，是一只眼睛望着互助组、合作社，另一只眼睛望着富农、商人和高利贷者，站在这两条路的十字路口上动摇不定。今天虽没有加入互助组、合作社，明天也许会加入的。可是，十字路口上是站不长的，如果老是不加入互助组、合作社，就必然要走上资本主义的路，就是多数人变成贫农、雇农，少数人变成剥削者。
    在农村，资本主义就是用雇佣工人、放高利贷（买青苗也是一种高利贷）或经营商业等等的办法来剥削人家的劳动。农村中的富农、高利贷者和商业资本家干的就是这种雇工、放高利贷、经营商业等等的剥削勾当。我们说农村走资本主义的路，意思就是农村一步步地让这些剥削者得势，让多数农民受他们的剥削。
    长久不加入互助组、合作社的农民，如果比较富裕，手中有了余粮余钱，往往就会学剥削者的样，进行种种的剥削活动。这种农民的剥削活动，就是大家常说的那种自发的资本主义倾向。一个农民，如果起先只是偶然进行次把剥削，得了点利，以后就会渐渐变成经常的剥削者。等到他靠剥削得来的收入成了他重要的或者主要的收入，这个农民也就不再是普通的农民（中农），而变成富农、高利贷者和商人这样的资本主义分子了，变成不是靠自己的劳动过活而是靠剥削别人来过活的人了。
    还有许多单干农民或者没有多少余粮余钱，或者没有去经商盘剥的心计，即使想当富农也当不成。但是他们也可能起了帮助农村向资本主义走的作用，因为这种单干的农民恰好是剥削者的好对象。要知道，如果没有被剥削者，剥削者是发不了财的。商人、高利贷者和富农很难向已经参加互助合作的农民打主意，但他们可以利用单干农民的贫穷来进行各种形式的剥削；单干农民也很容易上当受欺，例如有的农民禁不住商人的引诱就把粮食卖给他们，结果便宜了商人，自己吃了大亏。所以单干的农民多正好便利了商人、高利贷者和富农的发展。
    在这里要注意：第一、雇佣工人（不论长工、短工）和你雇我、我也雇你的换工性质的互助不同，不能混淆起来。雇工是出工资来买别人的劳动，可是劳动得多，工资出得少，所以是一种剥削，而且是资本主义的剥削；换工性质的互助，虽然有时也用工资的形式来交换，可是你雇我、我雇你，谁也不剥削谁，所以不算剥削，也不算资本主义的剥削。第二、高利贷和农民之间的互助性质的借贷不同，不能混淆起来。高利贷是把粮或钱借出去，要收回很高的利息；互助性的借贷则没有利息或只有极少的利息（多大的利息才算高利贷，因地点和时间条件的不同，暂时不能完全划一）。目前的高利贷也可以说是一种资本主义的剥削。第三、商业和农业副业、手工业不同，也不能混淆起来。商业是从不断地买进货物和卖出货物当中来进行剥削的，它并不生产任何东西，靠商业挣来的钱，都是别人的劳动成果，所以它是一种剥削；而农业副业和手工业却是靠自己的劳动来取得收入的，不是剥削。如农民用一头驴来跑运输（不是做买卖，而是帮国家或合作社运输货物），他所挣的钱是用走路、搬东西等等劳动换得的，那是劳动，而不是剥削。
    走资本主义的路，是少数人发财、绝大多数人贫穷破产的路，对于广大农民说来，是极其悲惨、极其痛苦的路，是于国于民都有害的路。现在，全国已经有很多农民看清这条路的危险，下决心不走这条路了。只有一部分农民，自己手中有点余粮余钱，土地又好，牲口又壮，就以为自己满有靠剥削发财的把握，一个劲地往富农、高利贷者和商人的窝里奔。其实，这也是靠不住的。有点余粮余钱，地好牲口壮，就能爬上富农、高利贷者和商人的地位吗？如果你也抢着、他也抢着靠剥削发财，那还不是你坑我，我赚你，大鱼吃小鱼，小鱼吃虾米，吃来吃去，还不一定把谁吃干净呢！就算侥幸地爬上了富农、高利贷者和商业资本家，不但不光荣，而且最后也还是没有出路的。大家知道，我们中国是一定要实行社会主义的，城市里的资本主义都要改造成为社会主义，农村的资本主义还能长期存在下去吗？所以，有觉悟的劳动农民一定要不走资本主义的路。
    三、社会主义的路是农民共同富裕的路
    那么，怎样才能不走资本主义的路呢？唯一的办法就是走社会主义的路。
    什么是社会主义？在农村，社会主义就是大家联合起来，用大规模生产和新的农具、农业机器和新的农作法来经营农业，使大家能够共同富裕。这就是说：第一、社会主义是劳动人民共同占有生产资料（土地、大农具、大牲畜等），也就是生产资料公有制。生产资料公有了，人剥削人的现象也就没有了，因为公有的生产资料是用来为大家生产，为大家谋幸福的。第二、社会主义的农业，是大规模生产，大家联合起来用新式农具、农业机器和新的农作法来经营，所以，比现在的农业生产规模大得多，劳动起来力量大得多。第三、实行了社会主义，生产的东西特别多，所以大家都能一年比一年富裕，将来大家的生活要比今天的富农和过去的地主的生活还好得多。第四、社会主义的分配方法是“按劳取酬”，谁劳动得好、劳动得多，谁得的报酬也多。有劳动力的人不劳动就没有饭吃。但是，孤寡老弱的人却能受到社会的照顾。所以，社会主义社会是最幸福、最光明的社会。
    可是，社会主义是不会自己跑来的，必须大家努力劳动来建设它，也不能一下子就建设成功，必须一步一步地向前发展。怎样才能一步步地走到社会主义社会呢？在农村，走社会主义的路，首先就得参加有社会主义萌芽性质的互助组，参加半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社和供销合作社、信贷合作社，然后就可以过渡到完全的社会主义性质的农业生产合作社（就是集体农庄）了。
    在社会主义的路上走一步就有一步的好处，越往前走，好处越大。
    为什么走一步就有一步的好处呢？
    从对农民的好处来说，一方面，互助组比单干生产得多，农业生产合作社又比互助组生产得多。据四川省七个农业生产合作社的调查：今年他们种的小麦平均比当地互助组多产百分之十六以上，比单干农民多产百分之三十四。山东文登县四区西南台村于松长农业生产合作社今年种玉米三十八亩，共打了一万二千八百零六斤，平均每亩三百三十七斤，比当地的一个互助组平均每亩多产九十八斤，比全村玉米每亩平均产量多一百零五斤。这个情形，当然不是四川和山东文登县一个地方的特殊情形，哪里都差不多。另一方面，参加了互助组、合作社，就不像单干农民那样向贫富两个方面分化了，农民就都可以一同富裕起来。万一有人遇到什么困难，也不用找什么财主想办法，因为大家一可以互相帮助，共同想法，二可以到信贷合作社去借钱。这时纵然有少数的人还想继续用剥削的办法发财，可是要雇工找不到工人，要放债找不到借户，要做生意，大家都走供销合作社，也没人理睬他们，他们要继续剥削下去就困难了。所以，发展互助组、合作社既可以避免农民的分化、不走资本主义的路，又可以使农民一步步共同富裕起来，最后走到社会主义社会。
    农民走社会主义的路，不但对农民有好处，而且对整个国家也有很大的好处。因为，第一、全国建设了，城市人口增加了，生产棉花、烟叶、茶叶、蚕丝、麻类、甘蔗、花生、芝麻、豆类、蔬菜、水果等项技术作物地区以及牧畜地区的人口也增加了，农民生活也好了，各方面对于粮食和其他农产品的需要越来越大，只有互助合作，增加生产，才能适合国家和人民的需要。第二、国家的经济建设是有计划的，全国要多少棉花、粮食都是有一定的数目的，多了就浪费，少了就不行；要的时间也是有一定的，春天要的，夏天到，就不行；这种情形就要农民有计划，而农民只有加入了合作社才好定计划。如果农民不用大规模生产，一家种一小块地，就不容易定计划，生产的东西不容易和国家的需要相合，国家生产的东西也不容易和农民的需要相合，多的多了，少的少了，无论多了少了，农民和国家都要吃亏。总之，农民走上社会主义的路，才能够有计划地配合工业化的需要，工业发展了，才能供给农民以新式农具和各种农业机器，农民有了机器，就可以越来越富裕，生活就越来越幸福了。
    共产党、毛主席是要带领全国人民走社会主义的路的，农民要永远跟着共产党、毛主席走这条路。
