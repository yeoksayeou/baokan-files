Xinhua News Agency, December 20th: According to TASS, working people throughout the Soviet Union are holding meetings to discuss the news about the completion of the investigation of Beria's treason case by the Soviet Supreme Procurator's Office, and unanimously demand severe punishment for these traitors with indignation. Mass rallies have been held in factories, enterprises, institutions, and educational organizations in many cities of the Russian Federation, with attendees expressing extreme anger at the crimes of the traitors led by Beria in betraying the motherland and conspiring to restore capitalist rule. At a staff meeting at the "Hammer and Sickle" steel factory in Moscow, steelworker Grebeshkov said passionately: We hate Beria and his accomplices, the henchmen of international imperialism. These devils wanted to restore capitalism in our country and attempted to restore bourgeois rule. Now let them see the indignation of the people! We believe that the Soviet judiciary will give these criminals the most severe punishment. At the Kirov factory in Leningrad, Mosingky, the foreman of the machine shop, severely denounced the traitors Beria and his accomplices, Merkulov and others, at a workers' meeting in the workshop. He called on all factory workers to raise their revolutionary vigilance and redouble their efforts for the happy future of the motherland.
    The working people of other union republics also expressed the same anger. At a workers' meeting at the Stalin Locomotive and Carriage Factory in Tbilisi, boilermaker Kervalishvili said that the state-harming crimes of the despicable imperialist henchman Beria and his accomplices have been exposed in time. They will be judged by Soviet law. We, the working people of Georgia, demand severe punishment for these criminals. Academician Muskhelishvili, Chairman of the Georgian Academy of Sciences, said at a staff meeting of the Academy: I believe that no malicious conspiracy of the enemy can shake our love and trust for the great Russian people, and I believe that this sentence expresses everyone's thoughts and beliefs. The intellectuals and working class of Georgia, together with the collective farmers, demand the most severe punishment for these shameful conspirators, traitors, and enemies of the people. In Kiev, the capital of the Ukrainian Republic, workers in factories and enterprises held meetings one after another, unanimously condemning these traitors who wanted to weaken the strength of the Soviet Union and undermine the great friendship between the Soviet nationalities. In their speeches, they resolutely expressed their love and support for the Soviet Communist Party and the government. They guaranteed to raise their vigilance and achieve greater labor achievements. They unanimously demanded severe punishment for Beria and his accomplices, the enemies of the people. In Minsk, the capital of the Belarusian Republic, scientists and graduate students of the Belarusian Academy of Sciences held a meeting. Kuprevich, the president of the academy, spoke at the meeting. He said that these conspirators wanted to offer our people as sacrifices to international imperialism. However, Beria and his accomplices cannot have any social foundation in the country. Rallies were held in Vilnius, Tashkent, Riga, and other cities and villages throughout the Soviet Union, demanding severe punishment for the traitors to the motherland.

    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社消息：苏联各地劳动人民纷纷集会讨论关于苏联最高检察署完成贝利亚叛国案件侦讯工作的消息，并一致愤慨地要求严惩这些叛徒。俄罗斯联邦许多城市的工厂、企业、机关和教育机构都举行了群众大会，到会者对以贝利亚为首的叛徒们背叛祖国、阴谋恢复资本主义的统治的罪行表示了极端的愤怒。莫斯科“镰刀与锤子”钢铁工厂炼钢工人格列别希科夫在该厂工作人员大会上激昂地说：我们痛恨国际帝国主义的雇佣分子贝利亚及其同谋犯。这些魔鬼想在我国使资本主义复辟，企图恢复资产阶级的统治。现在让他们看看人民的愤慨吧！我们相信苏维埃司法部门一定会给这些罪犯以最严厉的惩罚。在列宁格勒的基洛夫工厂，机器车间领班莫辛斯基在车间工人大会上痛斥叛徒贝利亚及其同谋犯麦尔库洛夫等人，他号召全厂工人提高革命警惕性，并为祖国的幸福前途而加倍努力。
    其他各加盟共和国的劳动人民也表示了同样的愤怒情绪。在第比利斯的斯大林机车与车辆工厂工人大会上，锅炉制造工人克尔瓦利希瓦利说，卑鄙的帝国主义雇佣分子贝利亚和他的帮凶们的危害国家的罪行已被及时揭发了。他们将受苏联法律的裁判。我们格鲁吉亚劳动人民要求严厉惩处这些罪犯。格鲁吉亚科学院主席穆斯海利希维利在该院工作人员大会上说：我认为敌人的任何恶毒的阴谋都不能动摇我们对伟大的俄罗斯人民的热爱和信任，我相信这句话表达了所有人的想法与信念。格鲁吉亚的知识分子与工人阶级跟集体农民一道，要求最严厉地惩处这些可耻的阴谋分子、叛国分子与人民的死敌。在乌克兰共和国首都基辅，各工厂企业的工人纷纷举行大会，一致指责这些想削弱苏联的力量，破坏苏联各族人民之间的伟大友谊的叛国贼。他们在讲话中坚决表示了他们对苏联共产党与政府的热爱和拥戴。他们保证提高警惕并获得更大的劳动成就。他们一致要求严厉惩处人民的死敌贝利亚及其同谋。在白俄罗斯共和国首都明斯克，白俄罗斯科学院的科学家与研究生举行了大会。科学院院长库普里维奇在会上讲了话。他说，这些阴谋分子想把我们人民当作牺牲品奉献给国际帝国主义。但是，贝利亚和他的同谋在国内不可能有任何社会基础。在维尔纳、塔什干、里加与苏联各地其他城市和农村都举行了大会，要求严厉惩办祖国的叛徒。
