Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 3rd: According to the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency, the Third Representative Conference of Agricultural Production Cooperatives of Bulgaria opened in Sofia on the 1st. The Bulgarian Minister of Agriculture, S. Todorov, delivered a report at the conference. He pointed out that thanks to the constant care of the Bulgarian People's Government and the selfless assistance from the Soviet Union in various aspects, Bulgaria has achieved great success in the socialist transformation of agriculture since the Second Representative Conference of Agricultural Production Cooperatives was held in April 1950. Since the last representative conference, the number of agricultural production cooperatives nationwide has increased from 1,633 to 2,747, and the number of peasant households participating in agricultural production cooperatives has increased from 175,000 to more than 568,900. The area of cultivated land they own has increased from 6 million decares (each decare is equivalent to more than one Chinese mu) to 25,125,000 decares. In other words, the peasant households currently participating in agricultural production cooperatives account for 52.3 percent of all peasant households, and their cultivated land area accounts for 60.5 percent of the total cultivated land area. At the same time, the degree of agricultural mechanization is also gradually increasing. This year, 58 percent of the spring field work was completed by machine tractor stations. The People's Government has established 149 machine tractor stations for agricultural production cooperatives. According to the plan, 56 percent of the autumn sowing preparations for agricultural production cooperatives will be completed by machine tractor stations this year. This year, the average unit area yield of wheat in agricultural production cooperatives is 21.7 percent higher than that of individual farmers, corn is 18.5 percent higher, sunflower is 30.2 percent higher, sugar beet is 27.7 percent higher, and cotton is 32 percent higher. Currently, the socialist sector in agriculture—agricultural production cooperatives and state-owned farms, etc.—supplies two-thirds of the state's purchased grain. Agricultural production cooperatives have become the main suppliers of industrial raw materials. They supply more than 75 percent of the total cotton needed and 84 percent of the sugar beet needed. Todorov concluded by putting forward the tasks of strengthening agricultural production cooperatives politically and economically in the future.
    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 5th: According to the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency, the Third Representative Conference of Agricultural Production Cooperatives of Bulgaria, which opened in Sofia on the 1st, closed on the third. General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Chervenkov, attended the closing meeting. At the meetings on the 2nd and 3rd, the representatives discussed the report of the Bulgarian Minister of Agriculture, Todorov. The conference finally adopted amendments to the model charter of agricultural production cooperatives.

    保举行农业生产合作社代表会议
    保加利亚农业的社会主义改造获得很大成就
    【新华社布拉格三日电】据保加利亚通讯社消息：保加利亚第三次农业生产合作社代表会议，于一日在索非亚开幕。保加利亚农业部部长斯·托多罗夫在会上作了报告。他指出：由于保加利亚人民政府的经常关怀和苏联多方面的无私帮助，自一九五○年四月第二次农业生产合作社代表会议举行以来，保加利亚在农业的社会主义改造方面已获得了巨大的成就。从上次代表会议到现在，全国的农业生产合作社已由一千六百三十三个增加到二千七百四十七个，参加农业生产合作社的农户已由十七万五千个增加到五十六万八千九百多个。它们拥有的耕地面积由六百万狄卡尔（每一狄卡尔合一市亩多）增加到二千五百一十二万五千狄卡尔。换句话说，目前参加农业生产合作社的农户已占全部农户的百分之五十二点三，其耕地面积占全部耕地面积的百分之六十点五。与此同时，农业机械化的程度也在逐步提高。今年有百分之五十八的春季田间工作是由机器拖拉机站完成的。人民政府已为农业生产合作社成立了一百四十九个机器拖拉机站。按照计划，今年农业生产合作社的百分之五十六的秋播准备工作由机器拖拉机站完成。今年农业生产合作社的小麦单位面积产量平均比个体农民多百分之二十一点七，玉蜀黍多百分之十八点五，向日葵多百分之三十点二，甜菜多百分之二十七点七，棉花多百分之三十二。目前农业中的社会主义部分——农业生产合作社和国营农场等，供给着国家采购粮食的三分之二。农业生产合作社已成为工业原料的主要供应者。它们供应全部棉花需要量的百分之七十五以上和甜菜需要量的百分之八十四。托多罗夫最后并提出了今后在政治上和经济上加强农业生产合作社的任务。
    【新华社布拉格五日电】据保加利亚通讯社消息：一日在索非亚开幕的保加利亚第三次农业生产合作社代表会议，已于三日闭幕。保加利亚共产党中央委员会总书记、部长会议主席契尔文科夫参加了闭幕会议。在二、三两日的会议上，代表们讨论了保加利亚农业部部长托多罗夫的报告。会议最后通过了关于农业生产合作社模范章程的修正案。
