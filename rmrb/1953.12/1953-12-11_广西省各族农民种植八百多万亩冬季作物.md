    Guangxi Province farmers of all ethnicities have basically completed planting over eight million mu of winter crops. Among these, the winter planting area in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region is approximately five million mu, an increase of approximately two million four hundred thousand mu compared to last year. Over 70 percent has already been planted, and it is estimated that this spring will see an increase of two hundred million jin of grain. The planted area for wheat, beans, sweet potatoes, and vegetables in other regions has also exceeded the planting area of last winter.
    In the past, although farmers of all ethnicities in Guangxi Province had the habit of winter planting, most held an attitude of "if there is a harvest, we'll take it; if not, we'll throw it away." In order to mobilize farmers to increase grain production and support national industrial construction, this year the CCP Central Committee South China Sub-bureau and the CCP Guangxi Provincial Committee instructed all localities to treat winter planting as a season of production. The secretary of the CCP Yishan Local Committee and members of the CCP County Committees in many counties went deep into grain-producing areas to lead farmers of all ethnicities in carrying out the winter planting movement. Farmers in counties such as Luzhai and Lingui completed the autumn harvest ahead of schedule and promptly planted wheat. Farmers of all ethnicities in counties such as Du'an and Mashan, who originally had no winter planting habits, also tried planting a considerable amount of buckwheat and potatoes this year. Many Zhuang farmers in counties such as Yongning and Wuming said: Planting one mu of land in winter will yield more grain next spring, which can improve our own lives and allow us to sell more grain to the state. Listening to the Communist Party is the right thing to do! They have expanded the winter planting area and are actively strengthening field management, planning to increase production by ten jin per mu compared to last winter.
    Due to the short winter planting period, farmers in various parts of Guangxi Province have organized many temporary mutual aid teams to overcome the difficulty of insufficient labor. At present, in order to ensure a bumper harvest of winter crops, farmers of all ethnicities have begun activities such as protecting seedlings and applying fertilizer.

### 广西省各族农民种植八百多万亩冬季作物

    广西省各族农民种植八百多万亩冬季作物
    广西省八百多万亩冬季农作物已基本种植完毕。其中桂西僮族自治区的冬种面积约达五百万亩左右，较去年扩大二百四十万亩，现已播种百分之七十以上，估计明春可增产两亿斤粮食。其他地区已播种的麦类、豆类、红薯和蔬菜，也超过了去冬的种植面积。
    广西省各族农民过去虽有冬种习惯，但大多抱着“有则收、无则丢”的态度。为了动员农民增产粮食，支援国家工业建设，今年中共中央华南分局和中共广西省委员会指示各地把冬种当作一季生产看待。中共宜山地方委员会书记和许多县的中共县委会委员都深入产粮地区，领导各族农民开展冬种运动。鹿寨、临桂等县农民提前完成秋收，及时种下了小麦。都安、马山等县各族农民原无冬种习惯，今年也试种了不少荞麦和马铃薯。邕宁、武鸣等县许多僮族农民说：冬种一亩田，来春多担粮，能改善自己生活，又能多卖粮食给国家，听共产党的话没错！他们纷纷扩大冬种面积，并积极加强田间管理，计划每亩要比去冬增产十斤粮食。
    由于冬种时间短促，广西省各地农民曾组织许多临时互助组，克服了劳动力不足的困难。目前，各族农民为保证冬种作物丰收，已开始进行保苗、追肥等活动。
