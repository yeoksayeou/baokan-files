Xinhua News Agency, December 14th: Vietnam News Agency commented on December 12th on the important significance of President Ho Chi Minh's reply to the editor-in-chief of the Swedish "Expressen," saying:

	President Ho Chi Minh's speech has aroused widespread reaction throughout the world and has generated enthusiastic discussion among many government officials, political figures, and people in France and around the world.

	Peace-loving people in France and around the world are very happy.

	The reactionaries in France and around the world are panicking and do not know what attitude to take; the puppets and traitors in Vietnam are terrified and at a loss. The reason why the reactionaries are in confusion and perplexity is that Ho Chi Minh's voice is the voice of a just cause, the firm and loud voice of a heroic nation determined to defend national independence and a peaceful life of freedom.

	The reactionaries and their puppets sing in chorus, distort the truth, and deliberately misinterpret President Ho Chi Minh's speech in order to deceive the people. They insist that they want peace, while we do not. The truth is that the government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have consistently pursued a peaceful policy to establish a truly independent Vietnam. This position has always been the case and will never change. The truth is that the French colonialists have been waging such a disastrous war on Vietnamese soil for so long. The Vietnamese army and people are resolutely fighting precisely for the sake of independence and peace. If the French government now fully respects Vietnam's independence and wishes to negotiate with the Vietnamese government to end this war, the people and government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are willing to accept the French proposal. This is very clear.

	The reactionaries and their running dogs absurdly claim that the Vietnamese people want peace because the Vietnamese people have become weak. But the fact is that the Vietnamese people are growing stronger as they fight, while the French colonialists have suffered more and more severe defeats, and their losses in manpower and money are becoming increasingly unbearable. Now, not only the working people of France oppose the Vietnam War, but also other classes in France, and even a section of the French bourgeoisie, oppose this war. At the end of 1948, apart from the Communist members of the French National Assembly, only five members of other parties opposed the Vietnam War. This year, in addition to the Communist members, more than 150 members of other parties oppose the war of aggression against Vietnam.

	The Vietnamese people hold high the banner of independence and peace because they have the strength of a just cause united by the whole nation and have received the widespread support of the peace-loving people of France, the French colonies, and the world. The struggles of the past seven or eight years have proved the powerful and invincible strength of the Vietnamese people. This is an obvious truth.

	If the French colonialists are still blind and do not recognize this truth, if they obey the orders of the American imperialists and continue the war of aggression against Vietnam, then the Vietnamese people, under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, will resolutely resist until they achieve complete victory. The Vietnamese patriotic war, supported by the people of France and the world, is long-term and arduous, but it will surely be victorious.

	The Vietnamese people have learned from their own experience that independence and peace can only be achieved through long-term and arduous struggle. They do not have the illusion that peace is easily obtained. The valuable experience of the Korean people further proves this point. As long as complete unification and independence have not been achieved, the Vietnamese people will remain vigilant, resolutely fight, and prepare to smash all the enemy's military and political conspiracies.

    越南通讯社评论胡志明谈话的重要意义
   【新华社十四日讯】越南通讯社十二日评论胡志明主席对瑞典“快报”主编的答复的重要意义说：
      胡志明主席的谈话，在全世界引起了广泛的反应，引起了法国及世界各地的许多政府人士和政界人物以及人民的热烈讨论。
    法国及全世界爱好和平的人民感到非常高兴。
    法国及世界反动派张惶失措，不知道采取什么态度；越南的傀儡和卖国贼们恐慌不已，不知如何是好。反动派陷于混乱和困惑的原因就是：胡志明主席的声音是正义事业的声音，是决心保卫民族独立与和平生活的自由的英雄民族的坚定而洪亮的声音。
      反动派和他们的傀儡一唱一和，歪曲真相并蓄意曲解胡志明主席的谈话，以便欺骗人民。他们硬说他们是希望和平的，而我们则不希望和平。真相是：越南民主共和国政府和人民为了建立一个真正独立的越南，始终不渝地奉行和平政策。这个立场
  一向如此，而且永远不变。真相是：法国殖民者在越南土地上进行了这样久的灾难性的战争。越南军队和人民坚决作战正是为了独立与和平的缘故。如果现在法国政府充分尊重越南的独立并希望和越南政府谈判以结束这场战争的话，越南民主共和国的人民和政府愿意接受法国的建议。这是十分清楚的。
    反动派和他们的走狗荒谬地声称，越南人民希望和平是因为越南人民已经变弱了，而事实是越南人民愈战愈强，法国殖民者却遭受了一次比一次严重的失败，他们的人力和金钱损失一天比一天难于负担。现在，不仅法国的劳动人民反对越南战争，而且法国其他阶层甚至法国资产阶级的一部分人也反对这场战争。在一九四八年年底，法国国民议会中除了共产党议员外，其他政党只有五个议员反对越南战争。今年，除了共产党议员以外，其他各政党有一百五十多个议员反对侵略越南的战争。
    越南人民高举着独立与和平的旗帜，因为他们有着全民一致的正义事业的力量，而且得到了法国、法国殖民地和全世界的爱好和平人民的广泛支持。这七、八年来的斗争已经证明了越南人民的这种强大的、不可战胜的力量。这是一个明显的真理。
    如果法国殖民者还是瞎着眼睛不认识这个真理，如果他们服从美帝国主义者的命令，继续进行侵略越南的战争，那末，越南人民在胡志明主席和越南民主共和国政府的领导下，将坚决抗战，直到获得完全胜利为止。受到法国及全世界人民支持的越南爱国战争是长期的、艰苦的，但是一定会获得胜利的。
    越南人民通过自己的经验认识到只有通过长期而艰苦的斗争才能获得独立与和平。他们并没有和平是很容易得来的这种幻想。朝鲜人民的宝贵经验进一步证明了这一点。只要完全的统一和独立还没有实现，越南人民将保持警惕，坚决斗争并准备粉碎敌人的一切军事阴谋和政治阴谋。
