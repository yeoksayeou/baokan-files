Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, December 29th: In 1953, the German Democratic Republic, based on the further development of industrial and agricultural production, implemented a new policy of improving people's lives and achieved great success.

The heavy industry and heavy machinery manufacturing industry have achieved great development in the past few years, preparing a solid foundation for the German Democratic Republic to implement the new policy. In 1953, the pig iron production of the German Democratic Republic was four times that of 1950. The "Stalin Steel Plant," which only started construction in January 1951, had four blast furnaces built and put into operation by the first half of 1953. It is expected that by the end of 1953, the total industrial output of the Republic will be 165 percent of the 1936 level, and the proportion of socialist state-owned enterprises in the total industrial output will reach 84 percent.

The high development of socialist heavy industry provides conditions for the great development of light industry as stipulated in this year's new policy. Taking the level of 1950 as 100, in 1953, the output of the textile industry was 142.8, the output of the sewing industry was about 153.4, the output of the food industry was about 184.2, and the output of the wood industry was 151.7. Many other daily necessities industries have also made great progress.

Due to the extensive promotion of the cooperative system and the large number of machines obtained from industry, the Republic's agriculture has also developed rapidly. At present, the total output of agricultural products has doubled compared with 1946. The yield per unit area of ​​grain crops has exceeded the pre-war level. At present, the Republic has about 5,000 agricultural production cooperatives, 605 machine tractor stations, and a total of 23,000 tractors.

Based on the development of industrial and agricultural production, the government of the German Democratic Republic has taken many measures this year to further improve the living conditions of the working people. As a result of repeated price reductions and increased wages for workers and staff, the actual income of employees in the Republic has increased by 27 billion marks this year. The purchasing power of residents has increased by 87 percent compared with 1950, while the cost of living has decreased by 30 percent during this period. Therefore, people's lives have been rapidly improved. In the second half of this year, the amount of goods sold to the people increased by about one-third compared with the first half of the year.

The great achievements made by various economic sectors of the Republic are inseparable from the high enthusiasm and creativity of the working people. At present, all factories and tractor stations in the German Democratic Republic have launched production competition campaigns. Under the slogan of "1954 is a year of great labor creativity," they are confidently welcoming 1954.

    民主德国的重工业获得很大发展
    奠定进一步发展工农业生产和改善人民生活的基础
    【新华社二十九日讯】柏林消息：一九五三年，德意志民主共和国在进一步发展工农业生产的基础上执行改善人民生活的新方针，获得了巨大的成就。
    重工业和重型机器制造业在过去几年中获得了巨大的发展，为德意志民主共和国执行新方针准备了巩固的基础，一九五三年，德意志民主共和国的铣铁生产量为一九五○年的四倍。一九五一年一月才开始建立的“斯大林钢铁工厂”，到一九五三年上半年已有四座高炉建成和开工。预计，到一九五三年年底，共和国全部工业产量将为一九三六年水平的百分之一六五，社会主义性质的公营企业的产量在全部工业产量中所占的比重将达百分之八十四。
    社会主义性质的重工业的高度发展，给今年新方针所规定的轻工业的大步发展提供了条件。以一九五○年的水平为一百，一九五三年，纺织工业产量为一四二·八，缝纫工业产量约为一五三·四，食品工业产量约为一八四·二，木材工业产量为一五一·七。其他许多日用品工业也有巨大发展。
      由于广泛推行合作制并从工业得到大量的机器，共和国的农业也得到了飞速的发展。目前，农产品的总产量比一九四六年增加了一倍。谷类作物的单位面积产量已超过了战前水平。现在，共和国约有五千个农业生产合作社，六百零五个机器拖拉机站，共拥有二万三千架拖拉机。
    在工农业生产发展的基础上，德意志民主共和国政府今年采取了许多措施来进一步改善劳动人民的生活条件。屡次的降低物价和增加工人和职员的工资的结果，今年共和国职工的实际收入增加了二百七十亿马克，居民的购买力比一九五○年提高了百分之八十七，而生活费用在这一时期却降低了百分之三十。因此，人民的生活获得了迅速的改善，在今年下半年，出售给人民的货物量比上半年增加了约三分之一。
    共和国各经济部门所取得的巨大成就，是与劳动人民所发挥的高度积极性与创造性分不开的。目前，德意志民主共和国所有的工厂和拖拉机站都已展开了生产竞赛运动，他们正在“一九五四年是伟大的劳动创造性的一年”的口号下，满怀信心地迎接一九五四年。
