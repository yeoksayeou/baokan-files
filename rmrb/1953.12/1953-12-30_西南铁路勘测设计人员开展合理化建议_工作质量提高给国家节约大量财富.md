    Southwest Railway Survey and Design Personnel Carry Out Rationalization Proposals
    Improved Work Quality Saves the Nation a Large Amount of Wealth

    The survey and design personnel of the Southwest Design Branch of the Central Ministry of Railways Design Bureau have carried out rationalization proposals, universally improving the quality of survey and design work, and saving the country a large amount of wealth.

    In the survey work of the Chengdu-Kunming Railway, in order to choose a more rational and economical route for the country, engineers Guo Yi, Lan Tian, Liu Xiaoting and the survey teams they led, frequently climbed dangerous cliffs and crossed rapid rivers along the banks of the Jinsha River and the Pudu River, conducting surveys back and forth. They surveyed five routes successively and studied twelve routes. Finally, they determined the most economical and reasonable route. This route was 31 kilometers shorter than the route surveyed by the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past, and reduced six Jinsha River bridges. Labor model engineer Guo Yi also proposed improvement suggestions for the routes in Kunming Mountain and Zigong City, shortening the route by five kilometers and saving 28 billion yuan in construction costs. In the preliminary survey of the Chengdu-Kunming Railway, various survey teams put forward many rationalization proposals to improve the route and improve the project. The 18th Survey and Design Corps alone put forward 122 rationalization proposals of various sizes. The "Flame Mountain Plan" proposed by engineer Ling Juegang shortened the preliminary survey length of the Pudu River by seven kilometers, saving the country 70 billion yuan in construction costs. Engineer Wang Daoyuan's continued "Double Locomotive Plan" was also twelve kilometers shorter than the original route. Technician Wang Kegong further studied and proposed the "Heigede Plan," with double locomotives all the way to Chutu, further shortening the route by four kilometers. When comrades of the large-scale construction section checked the preliminary survey profile of the central line (Jinsha River line) of the Chengdu-Kunming Railway, they saw that a large bridge in the Manyisi Station between Pingshan and Leibo was not very reasonable. After collective research, they suggested raising the line near the Shibantan in front of Manyisi, so that the line would turn into the river ditch, and add a 2.3-kilometer tunnel. In this way, the original measured line could be shortened by 7.7 kilometers, which could save 47.1 billion yuan in project costs. According to the above suggestions, the comrades of the survey section conducted further research and proposed a new plan that could shorten the route by 14 kilometers and reduce the construction of two stations.

    In order to improve the architectural design of the stations along the line, the comrades of the station yard section put forward four comparison plans for discussion during the research. Everyone believed that the limiting slope of the Chengdu-Kunming line had been improved from 12 per thousand to 10 per thousand, and it was suggested that the distance between the two stations should be extended from six to seven kilometers to eight to nine kilometers. In this way, seven passing stations and one section station could be reduced, saving 24 billion yuan in project costs. After the comrades of the housing construction section changed the original designed bungalows to buildings, not only could 60,000 yuan of construction costs be saved per square meter, but also a lot of land area could be reduced. After the Guangyuan Station dormitory was changed from bungalows to buildings, more than 190 mu of good farmland could be released.

    In order to save construction materials, the telecommunications section suggested that the sleepers that have not been laid and the telegraph poles that have not yet been erected should be pressure-treated with chemical preservatives to extend the service life of the wood by four or five times. If the sleepers and telegraph poles used in the unfinished section of the Tiancheng Railway and the Chengdu-Kunming Railway are all chemically preserved, calculated only on the basis of doubling the service life, the country can save a large amount of wood and investment costs of 159.1 billion yuan. In addition, the construction organization is also actively trying to reduce the loss rate of steel bars, cement, bricks, and glass.

    西南铁路勘测设计人员开展合理化建议
    工作质量提高给国家节约大量财富
    中央铁道部设计局西南设计分局勘测设计人员，开展合理化建议，普遍提高了勘测设计工作质量，为国家节约了大量财富。
    在成（都）昆（明）铁路的勘测工作中，为了给国家选择一条更合理更经济的线路，郭彝、蓝田、刘霄亭等工程师和他们所率领的勘测队员，沿着金沙江和普渡河两岸，经常爬上险峻的悬崖，渡过急湍的河流，来来回回进行勘测，先后勘测了五条线路，研究了十二条线路，最后确定了一条最经济、最合理的线路，这条线路较过去国民党反动派勘测的线路缩短了三十一公里，并减少了六座金沙江大桥。劳动模范郭彝工程师还对昆明山和自贡市两地线路提出改进建议，缩短了线路五公里，节省工程建筑费二百八十亿元。在成昆铁路初测工作中，各个勘测队提出了不少改善线路、改善工程的合理化建议，单第十八勘测设计总队就提出合理化建议大小一百二十二件。工程师凌爵刚提出的普渡河、
  “火焰山方案”比原来草测长度缩短了七公里，为国家节约建筑费七百亿元。工程师汪道元继续提出的“双机方案”也比原来的线路缩短了十二公里，技术员王克恭同志又进而研究，提出双机一直到初土的“黑格德方案”，又缩短线路四公里。大型建筑科同志们，检查成昆铁路中线（金沙江线）草测平剖面图时，看到屏山与雷波之间的蛮夷司车站内一个大桥不甚合理，经集体研究后，即建议将蛮夷司前的石板滩附近线路提高，使线路沿河沟转进，另增加一个二点三公里的隧道，这样就可缩短原测线路七点七公里，计可节约工程费四百七十一亿元。勘测科的同志们根据上项建议，又作了进一步的研究，提出一个可以缩短线路十四公里，并能减少两个车站建筑的新方案。
    为改善沿线车站的建筑设计，站场科的同志在研究时曾提出四个比较方案进行讨论，大家认为成昆线的限制坡已由千分之十二改善为千分之十，建议应将两个车站间的距离由六至七公里延展到八至九公里，这样就可以减少会让站七个、段站一个，可节约工程费二百四十亿元。房屋建筑科的同志将原来设计的平房改为楼房后，不但每一平方公尺可节省建筑费用六万元，而且可减少许多占地面积。单广元车站宿舍由平房改为楼房后，即可让出良田一百九十余亩。
    为了节省建筑器材，电务科建议将未铺轨的枕木和尚未架设的电杆木，用加压法将化学防腐剂压注木材内，可使木材使用年限延长四、五倍。如将天成铁路未完段及成昆铁路所用枕木和电杆木都进行化学防腐措施，只根据延长使用年限一倍计算，即可为国家节省大量木材和投资费用一千五百九十一亿元。此外，施工组织也正积极设法降低钢筋、水泥、砖及玻璃等的损耗率。
