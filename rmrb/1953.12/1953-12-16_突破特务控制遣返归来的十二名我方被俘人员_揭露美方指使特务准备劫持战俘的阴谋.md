Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 15th – Today, six North Korean People's Army prisoners of war and six Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war, who broke through special agent control, were repatriated. At the risk of their lives, they resolutely demanded to return, once again completely shattering the US side's outrageous lie of "prisoners of war would rather die than be repatriated."

Among those returning today were two North Korean People's Army prisoners of war, Liu Zhenze and Jin Yunxi, who returned after climbing over the barbed wire fence from Camp No. 53. Some of the prisoners of war in this camp had listened to explanations on the 16th of last month, but later the explanation work was interrupted until now because the Syngman Rhee special agents prevented the prisoners of war from coming out to listen to the explanations again. Both of these returnees had listened to the explanations on November 16th, but due to the long-term control and intimidation by the special agents, they were full of fear in the explanation tent and did not dare to express their desire to be repatriated at that time. This afternoon in Panmunjom, they explained to the Neutral Nations personnel and foreign reporters why the prisoners of war did not dare to apply for repatriation when listening to the explanations.

Liu Zhenze said that before listening to the explanations in Camp No. 53, the special agents had beaten a prisoner of war named Cui Yuanyi to death, carried his body outside the barbed wire fence, and lied to the Indian guard troops that he had died of illness. The special agents also threatened the prisoners of war, saying: "Cui Yuanyi wanted to return to the Republic and was beaten to death. Whoever dares to think about returning to the Republic, look at his example!" The special agents also stepped up "ideological reconnaissance," and threatened to kill any prisoner of war who showed slight anxiety or unease. Liu Zhenze and Jin Yunxi had both been separately called out by the special agents and intimidated. The special agents said to them: "A batch of people will be executed before going to listen to the explanations. If you are still indecisive, you will be one of them." At the same time, the special agents also deceived the prisoners of war, saying that those who applied for repatriation during the explanations would have to return to the original camp to wait for the five Neutral Nations to vote, and during this period, the special agents could arbitrarily kill all those who applied for repatriation.

Liu Zhenze said that when he entered the explanation tent, he did not know anything about the "Terms of Reference" and did not know anything about the prisoners of war listening to explanations and exercising their right to be repatriated. He only knew that the special agent "Guard Captain" had organized the guard team into five detachments, distributed among the prisoners of war with various weapons, some prepared to harm the explanation representatives, and some prepared to kill the prisoners of war who applied for repatriation. Therefore, Liu Zhenze and Jin Yunxi did not dare to express their desire to apply for repatriation at that time and returned to the camp.

Liu Zhenze and Jin Yunxi said: But as time passed day by day, the special agents in the camp were stepping up preparations for forcing the prisoners of war to escape from the camp. Seeing that the opportunity for repatriation was getting less and less, we had no choice but to risk our lives to climb over the barbed wire fence and escape! Other returning personnel from our side also confirmed the US side's conspiracy to hijack prisoners of war to "escape" in front of the Neutral Nations personnel and foreign reporters. Jin Jisong, a North Korean People's Army prisoner of war who escaped from Camp No. 50, said that the US special agent agency "CIE" had issued an instruction to the special agent leader of Camp No. 50 a few days ago, which stipulated the main points of the plan on how to act on December 22nd and January 22nd. The "Battalion Commander" announced these key points to the prisoners of war, saying: "The explanation work will end on December 22nd. Because the representatives of the United Nations will delay the convening of the political conference as much as possible, there will be no political conference before January 22nd next year. By that time, we must go to South Korea. As soon as we receive the order, we will rush out of the barbed wire fence and escape south."

Lu Jinliang, a prisoner of war from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, said: The US military has prepared a large bell to tell the special agents to escape from the camp. It is now hanging outside the camp near the train station. When the bell rings, the special agents will hijack the prisoners of war and escape.

    突破特务控制遣返归来的十二名我方被俘人员
    揭露美方指使特务准备劫持战俘的阴谋
    【新华社开城十五日电】今天有突破特务控制的六名朝鲜人民军被俘人员和六名中国人民志愿军被俘人员被遣返归来。他们冒着生命危险坚决要求归来，又一次彻底粉碎了美方所谓“战俘宁死不愿遣返”的弥天大谎。
    今日归来人员中有两名自第五十三号营场翻铁丝网归来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员刘真泽和金允熙。这个营场的战俘有一部分在上月十六日听过解释，以后由于李承晚特务阻止战俘再出来听取解释，使解释工作中断至今。这两名归来人员在十一月十六日都曾听过解释，但由于特务长期的控制和恐吓，使他们在解释帐篷里时充满了疑惧，当时不敢表达要求遣返的愿望。他们今天下午在板门店对中立国人员和各国记者说明了为什么战俘在听解释时不敢申请遣返的原因。
    刘真泽说，在第五十三号营场听解释以前，特务们曾打死一个名叫崔元一的战俘，把他的尸首抬到铁丝网外面，骗印度看管部队说是病死了。特务们并威胁战俘说：“崔元一要想回共和国被打死了，谁还敢想回共和国就看他的样子！”特务们还加紧了“思想侦察”，对稍微表现焦虑或不安情绪的战俘，就恐吓他要杀死他。刘真泽和金允熙都曾被特务们单独叫去恐吓过。特务们对他们说：“去听解释以前还要处死一批人，如果你还三心二意，你也将是当中的一个。”同时，特务们又欺骗战俘说，解释时申请遣返的人还要回到原来营场等待五个中立国表决，而在这期间，特务们可以随意杀死所有申请遣返的人。
    刘真泽说，他自己进解释帐篷时，一点也不知道“职权范围”，一点也不知道关于战俘听取解释和行使被遣返权利的任何情况。他只知道特务“警备队长”已把警备队组织成五个分队，带着各种武器分布在战俘中，有的准备伤害解释代表，有的准备杀死申请遣返的战俘。因此刘真泽和金允熙当时不敢表示申请遣返，仍回到营场。
    刘真泽和金允熙说：但是，时间一天一天过去，营场里的特务却在加紧进行强迫战俘越营逃跑的准备工作，眼看遣返的机会越来越少，我们只得冒死翻铁丝网逃出来！今日归来的其他我方被俘人员，也在中立国人员和各国记者面前证实了美方劫持战俘“逃跑”的阴谋。从五十号营场逃出来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员金基松说，美国特务机关“CIE”前几天曾发给第五十号营场特务头子一个指示，上面规定了在十二月二十二日和一月二十二日应该怎样行动的计划要点。“大队长”曾对战俘们宣布这些要点说：“十二月二十二日解释工作结束，因为联合国的代表尽可能拖延政治会议的召开，在明年一月二十二日之前不会有政治会议，到了那时候，我们一定要到南朝鲜去。一得到命令，我们就冲出铁丝网，向南逃跑。”
    中国人民志愿军被俘人员吕金良说：美军已准备好了告诉特务越营的一个大钟，现在悬挂在营地外面靠近火车站的地方，到时候钟声一响，特务们就将挟持战俘逃跑。
