Reader's Letters Abstract:

    Beijing Railway Transportation Sub-bureau Should Value Planned Transportation Work
    A letter from the Communications Group of the Car Department of the Zhangjiakou Railway Transportation Sub-bureau: The Beijing Railway Transportation Sub-bureau does not value planned transportation, resulting in slow vehicle turnaround and chaotic transportation order, which seriously affects the completion of our bureau's transportation tasks. For example, on September 8th, the Beijing Railway Bureau ordered the Beijing Railway Transportation Sub-bureau to allocate 307 empty cars to our bureau and had already made a daily plan. However, the Beijing Railway Transportation Sub-bureau only sent 216 cars, completing only 70.4 percent of the daily plan. This situation occurs frequently. According to statistics, the sub-bureau allocated 890 fewer empty cars to our bureau in the first and middle ten days of September. This has caused many urgently needed materials to be stockpiled in our bureau; it has also prevented our bureau from completing the task of allocating empty cars to the Datong Railway Transportation Sub-bureau.
    The trains dispatched by the sub-bureau are also frequently delayed. For example, 90 percent of the 14 trains running on September 8th and the 13 trains running on September 10th were not on time. Train No. 805 on September 10th was delayed for as long as 11 hours and 22 minutes, seriously disrupting transportation order and causing unreasonable phenomena such as trains failing to connect and loaded cars waiting for locomotives. In the first ten days of September, due to train delays, 33 freight trains had their dwell time extended on the line while waiting for locomotives. More seriously, the sub-bureau often disregards the overall interests of the railway for the convenience of its own unit and arbitrarily instructs locomotives to run solo. For example, on September 2nd, train No. 844, which was parked at Nankou Station, should have been towed away by the locomotive of train No. 802 according to the plan; however, the dispatch office of the Beijing Railway Transportation Sub-bureau instructed this locomotive to return to Xizhimen solo. As a result, the locomotive stopped at various stations along the way for 2 hours and 41 minutes, while the entire train of loaded cars of train No. 844 was stockpiled at Nankou Station, not only causing dissatisfaction among the cargo owners but also causing line congestion.
    In order to solve the above problems, we have raised several opinions to the Beijing Railway Bureau. Although the Beijing Railway Bureau has criticized the Beijing Railway Transportation Sub-bureau's mistakes of not valuing planned transportation and not implementing planned management, it has not taken concrete measures to urge them to correct them, so that this unreasonable phenomenon has existed for a long time. We hope that the higher leading organs will pay close attention to and quickly solve this problem, so as not to affect the development of the railway's production increase and economy movement.

### 北京铁路运输分局应该重视计划运输工作

    北京铁路运输分局应该重视计划运输工作
    张家口铁路运输分局车务科通讯小组来信：北京铁路运输分局不重视计划运输，造成车辆周转缓慢、运输秩序混乱的情况，以致严重影响了我局运输任务的完成。如九月八日，北京铁路管理局令北京铁路运输分局为我局排送空车三百零七辆，并已作出日班计划；可是北京铁路运输分局只送来二百十六辆车，仅完成日计划的百分之七十点四。这种情况是经常发生的。据统计，该局在九月上旬和中旬共少拨给我局空车八百九十辆。这就使我局很多急待运出的物资积压起来；同时也使我局不能完成向大同铁路运输分局排送空车的任务。
    该局排送的列车还经常晚点。如九月八日运行的十四列列车和九月十日运行的十三列列车，百分之九十都不能正点。九月十日的第八百零五次车晚点竟达十一小时二十二分，严重地破坏了运输秩序，造成列车互不衔接及重车等待机车等不合理现象。九月上旬，由于列车晚点，就有三十三列货车为了等待机车在线路上延长了停留时间。更严重的是，该局为了本单位的方便，常常不顾铁路的整体利益，随便指示机车放单机。如九月二日，停留在南口站的第八百四十四次列车按照计划应由第八百零二次的机车拖走；但北京铁路运输分局调度所却指示这次机车放单机回西直门。结果机车在沿途各站停了二点零四十一分钟，而第八百四十四次的整列重车却被积压在南口车站，不但引起货主的不满，而且造成线路的堵塞。
    为了解决上述问题，我们曾向北京铁路管理局提过几次意见。北京铁路管理局虽曾对北京铁路运输分局不重视计划运输和不执行计划管理的错误行为提出了批评，但却没有采取具体措施督促他们纠正，以致使这种不合理的现象长期存在。我们希望上级领导机关切实重视并迅速解决这个问题，免得影响铁路增产节约运动的开展。
