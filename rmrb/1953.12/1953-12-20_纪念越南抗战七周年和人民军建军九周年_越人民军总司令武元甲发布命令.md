Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Hanoi—The Vietnamese News Agency reports: To commemorate the seventh anniversary of the nationwide resistance war in Vietnam and the ninth anniversary of the founding of the Vietnamese People's Army, Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, issued an order to the entire army on the 19th. The full text is as follows:
    Comrades Commanders and Fighters:
    This December 19th marks the beginning of the eighth year of our nationwide resistance war.
    From the day the first propaganda team of the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army was established to this December 22nd, the Vietnamese People's Army will have a history of nine years.
    On the occasion of these two historically significant festivals, I would like to extend my congratulations to the commanders and fighters who are fighting the enemy on various battlefields across the country and extend warm greetings to the wounded soldiers. On behalf of the entire People's Army, I would like to express my deep condolences to the martyrs who gloriously sacrificed themselves to defend the motherland.
    I would like to extend my congratulations to the civilian laborers who are working on the front lines to ensure the supply of military food and ammunition.
    I would like to extend my warm greetings to the families of the military personnel, especially the families of the wounded soldiers and the martyrs.
    In the seven years of resistance against the imperialist aggressors, our People's Army has consistently fought the aggressors with unyielding spirit.
    Our army has continuously grown in battle. Our army, which initially consisted of small guerrilla units, has now developed into a powerful People's Army with hundreds of thousands of regular troops and local forces, and millions of militiamen and guerrillas. Our army has achieved many glorious victories: eliminating more than 320,000 enemy troops, liberating more than 78,000 square kilometers of land, and expanding the Viet Bac base area to the north to the Chinese border and to the south to the Vietnamese-Laotian border; consolidating and developing guerrilla warfare in enemy-occupied areas, and establishing many extensive guerrilla base areas in the heart of enemy territory. It is particularly worth pointing out that since the victory of the Viet-China border campaign, our People's Army has continuously defeated the enemy in seven major campaigns, gaining the initiative on the North Vietnamese battlefield.
    Since the French army suffered a heavy blow from our army in northwestern Vietnam and the Lao People's Liberation Army inflicted a heavy blow in Upper Laos, especially since the US imperialists suffered defeat in Korea and were forced to sign the armistice agreement, the American interventionists and French colonialists have been trying their best to expand the war in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos in an attempt to implement the "Navarre Plan," expand the puppet army, concentrate mobile units to conduct "sweeps" in enemy-occupied areas, and invade liberated areas, attempting to regain military initiative. This is the enemy's new and sinister plot.
    But we have the wise leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese Labor Party, and the government, as well as the correct political and military lines; we have the enthusiastic support of the united front of the entire people; and we also have the following favorable conditions to shatter the enemy's conspiracy:
    First, after conducting political and military rectification, especially after the recent political transformation movement, our People's Army has made significant progress in political level and tactics and technology; the fighting spirit of commanders and fighters has been further enhanced.
    Second, the Vietnamese Labor Party and the government have mobilized the peasant masses to thoroughly implement rent reduction and interest reduction, and have achieved many victories. In early December of this year, the Vietnamese National Assembly unanimously passed the Land Reform Law to realize the slogan "Land to the Tiller." This is a great victory, which greatly encourages our army, strengthens the anti-war forces of the entire people, and strengthens the combat forces of our army.
    Third, the sympathy and support of the world's peace and democracy camp, led by the Soviet Union, and the people of France and the French colonies for our resistance war is increasing day by day; the alliance of the three countries of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos is becoming more and more consolidated; the "International Day of Active Support for the Vietnamese People" initiated by the Third World Federation of Trade Unions will further strengthen the confidence of our people and encourage the more resolute fighting spirit of our People's Army.
    In order to commemorate these two historically significant festivals, and in order to respond to President Ho Chi Minh's call to fulfill the two central tasks of resisting the enemy with all our strength and implementing land reform, I, in the name of the Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, order you—all commanders and fighters of the national regular army and local forces, militiamen and guerrillas:
    1. We must carry forward the heroic fighting and fearlessness of hardship of the revolutionary traditions of the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army propaganda team, strive to launch a campaign to annihilate the enemy and perform meritorious service, eliminate more of the enemy's living forces, step up guerrilla warfare, defend the liberated areas, and smash the "Navarre Plan."
    2. We must thoroughly implement the Land Reform Law, implement the land policies of the Party and the government, and resolutely support the peasants in their great struggle to achieve "Land to the Tiller."
    Comrades Commanders and Fighters!
    Under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese Labor Party, and the government, our People's Army will surely defeat the imperialist aggressors, break the "Navarre Plan," and smash the conspiracy of the French colonialists and American interventionists to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam.
    Our People's Army will surely defeat the enemy in the heroic struggle for the complete independence of the motherland, for the peasants to obtain land, and for the defense of peace and democracy in the Far East and the world.
    Best wishes and victorious greetings!

    纪念越南抗战七周年和人民军建军九周年
    越人民军总司令武元甲发布命令
    【新华社讯】越南通讯社讯：为纪念越南全国抗战七周年和越南人民军建军九周年，越南人民军总司令武元甲在十九日向全军发布命令。全文如下：全体指挥员和战斗员们：
    我们的全国抗战在今年十二月十九日就要进入第八年了。
    自从越南人民解放军的第一支宣传队建立的一天到今年十二月二十二日，越南人民军将有九年的历史。
    在这两个具有历史意义的节日来临之际，我谨向正在全国各战场上和敌人作战的指挥员和战斗员们表示祝贺，向伤员们致以热烈的慰问。我谨代表全体人民军向为保卫祖国而光荣牺牲的烈士们致以沉痛的悼念。
    我谨向正在前线工作以保证军粮和弹药的供应的民工们表示祝贺。
    我谨向军人家属、特别是伤员家属和烈士家属致以热烈的慰问。
    在七年来对帝国主义侵略者进行的抗战中，我们人民军始终不屈不挠地和侵略者进行战斗。
    我们的军队是在战斗中不断成长起来的。我们的军队起先只是小支游击队，现在已发展成为一支拥有数十万正规军和地方部队与数百万民兵和游击队的强大的人民军了。我们的军队已获得许多辉煌的胜利：歼灭敌军三十二万名以上，解放土地七万八千多方公里，并把越北根据地扩展到北至中国边界、南至越、寮边界；巩固和发展了敌后地区的游击战，在敌后心脏地区建立起许多广大的游击根据地。特别值得指出的是，自越、中边界战役胜利以来，我们人民军在七大战役中连续战胜敌军，掌握了北越战场上的主动权。
    自从法军在越南西北地区遭受我军沉重打击，在上寮遭受寮国人民解放军的沉重打击以来，特别是美帝国主义在朝鲜遭受失败而被迫签订停战协定以来，美国干涉者和法国殖民者一直在竭力扩大越南、高棉和寮国的战争，企图实现“纳瓦尔计划”，扩充伪军、集中机动部队在敌占区进行“扫荡”，侵犯解放区，妄图夺回军事上的主动权。这就是敌人的新的恶毒的阴谋。
    但我们有胡志明主席、越南劳动党和政府的英明领导以及政治和军事方面的正确路线；我们获得全体人民的统一战线的热烈支持；我们还具有下列粉碎敌人阴谋的有利条件：
    第一，在进行政治和军事整训以后，特别是最近进行政治上的改造运动以后，我们人民军在政治水平和战术、技术方面都有了显著的进步；指挥员和战斗员们的战斗精神是进一步提高了。
    第二，越南劳动党和政府已发动农民群众起来彻底实行减租减息，并已取得许多胜利。今年十二月初，越南国民大会一致通过了土地改革法，实现“耕者有其田”的口号。这是一个巨大的胜利，它大大鼓舞了我们的军队，使全体人民的抗战力量和我们的军队的战斗力量更加坚强。
    第三，以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营和法国人民以及法国殖民地的人民对我们抗战的同情和支持日益增加；越南、高棉、寮国三个国家的联盟日趋巩固；世界工会第三次代表大会所发起的“国际积极支援越南人民日”将更加加强我国人民的信心，并鼓舞我们人民军的更坚决的斗志。
    为了纪念这两个具有历史意义的节日，为了响应胡志明主席的号召，实现全力抗击敌人和实行土地改革这两个中心任务，我以越南人民军总司令的名义命令你们——全国正规军和地方部队、民兵和游击队的全体指挥员和战斗员们：
    一、必须发扬越南人民解放军宣传队英勇战斗、不畏艰苦的革命传统，努力展开歼敌立功竞赛运动，消灭敌人更多的有生力量，加紧游击战争，保卫解放区，粉碎“纳瓦尔计划”。
    二、必须彻底执行土地改革的法令，执行党和政府的土地政策，坚决支持农民争取实现“耕者有其田”的伟大斗争。
    全体指挥员和战斗员们！
    在胡志明主席、越南劳动党和政府的领导下，我们人民军一定会战胜帝国主义侵略者，打破“纳瓦尔计划”，并粉碎法国殖民者和美国干涉者扩大侵越战争的阴谋。
    我们的人民军在争取祖国的完全独立、在为农民取得土地和为保卫远东与世界的和平民主的英勇的战斗中，一定会战胜敌人。
    谨致热烈的祝贺和胜利的敬礼！
