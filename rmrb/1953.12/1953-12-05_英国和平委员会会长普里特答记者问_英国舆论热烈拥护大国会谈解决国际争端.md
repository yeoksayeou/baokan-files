Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 1st (Delayed Dispatch) This reporter interviewed D. N. Pritt, a member of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, President of the British Peace Committee, and Queen's Counsel, during the World Peace Council meeting in Vienna. Pritt told the reporter: British public opinion, like world public opinion, warmly supports holding a Great Power conference to resolve international disputes and ease international tensions.

Pritt said that the British government's policy toward the People's Republic of China, following the policy of the United States government, runs counter to the interests of the British people. This is the case, for example, on the issues of the seat of New China in the United Nations and the "embargo" issue. Excluding the representatives of New China from the United Nations is harmful to the British people and the people of the world, except for a small group of American rulers. We can and must make the United Nations a true instrument of world peace, and not a weapon of American policy.

Pritt said that the ban on trade with New China specifically and seriously damages British interests. Britain can only survive economically through large-scale exports. It is very difficult for Britain to export many goods to the United States. As a result of the war, and due to American competition, Britain has lost many of its old markets. Its exports have already been affected by German and Japanese competition (mostly funded by the United States). Unless it can find a way out in the markets of the new democratic world, especially the vast market of New China, it cannot actually survive. Britain must get rid of the American "embargo," otherwise it will be strangled.

    英国舆论热烈拥护大国会谈解决国际争端
    【新华社维也纳一日电】（迟到）本社记者在世界和平理事会在维也纳开会期间，访问了出席会议的世界和平理事会常务委员会委员、英国和平委员会会长、女皇顾问丹·诺·普里特。普里特对记者说：英国舆论像世界舆论一样，是热烈拥护召开大国会议，来解决国际争端，并缓和国际紧张局势的。
    普里特说：英国政府在对中华人民共和国的政策上追随美国政府的政策，这是和英国人民的利益背道而驰的。例如在新中国在联合国组织中的席位问题与“禁运”问题上，就是这样。把新中国代表排斥在联合国组织门外，除了对于一小撮美国统治者以外，对于英国人民和全世界人民都是有害的。我们能够而且必须使联合国组织成为世界和平的真正工具，而不成为美国政策的武器。
    普里特说：禁止与新中国贸易具体地、严重地损害了英国的利益。英国只有大量输出，才能在经济上生存。英国要向美国输出许多货物是很困难的。由于大战的结果，由于美国的竞争，英国丧失了许多旧有的市场。它在输出方面，已经受到了德日竞争（大部是由美国出资撑腰）的影响。除非它能在新民主世界的市场，首先是新中国的广大市场找到出路，否则它实际上就不能生存下去。英国必须摆脱美国的“禁运”，不然的话，就会被扼死。
