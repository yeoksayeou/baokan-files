Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 14th (Special Correspondent Report): U.S. representative Dean is now openly admitting that his reason for disrupting the bilateral talks on the political conference issue is to allow Syngman Rhee ample opportunity to realize his conspiracy of forcibly retaining prisoners of war and undermining the armistice agreement.

On the 13th, Dean issued two statements. In the first statement, Dean repeated the outrageous lies he spread to the world after unilaterally interrupting the talks on the 12th, desperately trying to deny his responsibility for sabotaging the convening of a political conference. He once again attempted to make people believe that the reason he stormed out of the meeting was because the Korean and Chinese side, based on facts, accused the U.S. side of condoning Syngman Rhee's perfidious act of forcibly retaining more than 27,000 prisoners of war. But no one will believe this excuse. A reporter from the Associated Press covering the North Atlantic aggressive group council meeting in Paris "obtained" information admitting that Dean's withdrawal from the Panmunjom talks was not due to the solemn accusations of the Korean and Chinese side. This news is by no means groundless, as Dean's boss Dulles is attending this meeting in Paris.

The real reason Dean interrupted the talks was openly revealed in his other statement. Dean completely forgot that his identity was that of a representative sent by the U.S. government to conduct bilateral talks with the Korean and Chinese side solely on the issue of the political conference, and that he was not qualified to express any opinions on the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement regarding the issue of prisoners of war. However, he actually issued a statement on the issue of prisoners of war. In this self-incriminating statement, he said: "Regardless of whether a political conference will be convened," "prisoners of war must be released completely according to the timetable." According to his timetable, "explanations should end on December 22nd," "prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to repatriation should be restored to civilian status on January 22nd, 1954," and "on February 22nd, 1954, the prisoner of war work will be completed, and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission will announce its dissolution."

It can be seen from Dean's statement, which is inconsistent with his identity, that his purpose in interrupting the talks is to realize this timetable for forcibly retaining prisoners of war. In Seoul on the 13th, he told American reporters that he wanted to drag out the current stalemate until at least March of next year, that is, past February 22nd on his timetable. He said, "If an agreement on the political conference can only be reached by March of next year, then the conference cannot be convened until May." Today, he more bluntly declared that on January 22nd, the day Syngman Rhee implements the forced retention of prisoners of war, the United States will deploy troops in the southern part of the demilitarized zone to meet him. This is completely consistent with the conspiracy of the U.S. side revealed by the captured personnel from the Korean and Chinese side who have broken through the special agent control and returned for repatriation. The U.S. government is now clearly harboring the kind of侥幸 mentality often held by gamblers, attempting to use the future of Korean peace as a bet to seek the so-called "victory" of their "psychological warfare" that has suffered a disastrous defeat.

Dean's intention to sabotage the bilateral talks is now known to everyone. However, Dean is still pretending, putting on an act of hoping that the talks will resume. After holding a series of talks with Syngman Rhee and giving Syngman Rhee enough encouragement for his actions to forcibly retain prisoners of war, he has announced that he will return to the United States on the 15th. In order to continue to deceive world opinion, he left his advisor, Young, in Seoul and announced that if the bilateral talks are not resumed by December 19th, the United States will make a "positive decision." Dean's statement is completely consistent with the "prediction" of U.S. officials in Tokyo on December 8th. When Dean put forward the so-called seventeen "suggestions," they had already calculated that the U.S. delegation would leave Korea before December 20th. All evidence proves that Dean's interruption of the bilateral talks was to execute a long-planned sabotage plan. Dean's any guilty attempts to cover up will absolutely not be able to shirk the U.S. side's responsibility for sabotaging the convening of a political conference.

### 迪安中断双方会谈是为了强迫扣留战俘

    迪安中断双方会谈是为了强迫扣留战俘
    【新华社开城十四日电】本社特派记者报道：美国代表迪安现在已经毫不掩饰他之所以要破坏关于政治会议问题的双方会谈，就是为了要让李承晚有充分的机会来实现其强迫扣留战俘、破坏停战协定的阴谋。
    迪安在十三日发表了两个声明。在第一个声明里，迪安重复他在十二日片面中断会谈以后向全世界撒过的弥天大谎，竭力抵赖他破坏政治会议召开的责任。他再一次企图使人相信，他之所以面红耳赤地退出会场，是因为朝中方面根据事实指责了美方纵容李承晚强迫扣留二万七千多名战俘的背信行为。但是这种藉口是没有人会相信的。美联社在巴黎采访北大西洋侵略集团理事会会议的记者“获得”的消息承认，迪安退出板门店会谈，并不是由于朝中方面的严正指责。这个消息决不是无原无故的，因为迪安的老板杜勒斯正在巴黎参加这个会议。
    迪安中断会谈的真正原因，在他的另一个声明中公开地表明了出来。迪安完全忘记了他的身份是美国政府派来仅仅和朝中方面进行关于政治会议问题的双方会谈的代表，他没有资格就朝鲜停战协定中关于战俘问题的条款发表任何意见。可是他居然发表了一个关于战俘问题的声明。他在这个不打自招的声明中说：“不论政治会议是否会召开”，“战俘一定要完全按照时间表予以释放”。按照他的这张时间表，“解释应于十二月二十二日终止”，“尚未行使被遣返权利的战俘应于一九五四年一月二十二日恢复平民身份”，“一九五四年二月二十二日那天，战俘工作完成，中立国遣返委员会宣告解散”。
    从迪安这个不合他的身份的声明中可以看出，他中断会谈的目的就是为了要实现这张强迫扣留战俘的时间表。他十三日在汉城向美国记者们表示他要把目前的僵局至少拖到明年三月，也就是拖过他的时间表上的二月二十二日以后。他说，“如果到明年三月才能达成关于政治会议的协议，那么会议在五月以前还不可能召开。”他在今天更直率地宣称，到一月二十二日李承晚实行强迫扣留战俘的那一天，美国将在非军事区南部布置军队予以接应。这和已经突破特务控制遣返归来的朝中被俘人员所揭露的美方的阴谋，完全相符。美国政府现在显然怀着一个赌棍所常有的那种侥幸心理，企图以朝鲜和平的前途为赌注，来寻取他们的已经遭到惨败的“心理战”的所谓“胜利”。
    迪安破坏双方会谈的用心所在，现在已经无人不知。可是迪安却还在装腔作势，摆出一副希望会谈恢复的架子。他在和李承晚举行了一连串的会谈，给李承晚强迫扣留战俘的行动打足了气以后，已经宣布将在十五日回美国。为了继续欺骗世界舆论，他把他的顾问杨格留在汉城，并且宣布：如果到十二月十九日双方会谈还不恢复，美国就将作出“肯定的决定”。迪安的这个说法完全符合十二月八号东京方面的美方人士的“预测”。这些人士在迪安提出十七点所谓“建议”的时候，就算准了美国代表团将在十二月二十日以前离开朝鲜。一切证据都证明迪安中断双方会谈是执行一个预谋已久的破坏计划。迪安的任何作贼心虚的掩饰伎俩，绝对推卸不了美方破坏政治会议的召开的责任。
