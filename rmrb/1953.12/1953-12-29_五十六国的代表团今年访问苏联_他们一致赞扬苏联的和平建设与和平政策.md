(Xinhua News Agency, December 28th) In 1953, people from various countries sent delegations to the Soviet Union for visits and tours. According to incomplete statistics, in the first eleven months of this year, more than 110 delegations from 56 countries visited the Soviet Union. Among them, in addition to delegations from the People's Republic of China, the German Democratic Republic, and other People's Democratic countries, there were also various delegations from capitalist and colonial countries such as the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Japan, India, Iran, Tunisia, Switzerland, Norway, Canada, Brazil, and Chile. These delegations were composed of people of different professions, political views, and religious beliefs. After their visits, they gained a deeper understanding of the truth about the Soviet Union, a truth that is obscured by countless slanders and lies in the capitalist world.

    Delegations from various countries were given ample opportunities to visit and tour the Soviet Union. They visited cities and villages, and toured factories, mines, and collective farms. Some delegations also toured the Lenin Volga-Don Canal. Many representatives from capitalist countries said after their visits that the reality of the Soviet Union was even better than they had originally imagined; the Soviet Union's great achievements in all aspects were unimaginable in capitalist countries. The Austrian workers' delegation and the Norwegian workers' delegation, during their visits throughout the Soviet Union, admired the huge scale of Soviet construction, calling the Soviet Union "a huge construction site." Ma. Zhibolan, a member of the French trade union delegation, after visiting the Soviet Union, believed that anyone coming to the Soviet Union from a country with economic stagnation and frequent unemployment threats would be particularly surprised by the Soviet Union's economic boom, which was not surprising at all. He said: "We see many factories, bridges, and apartment buildings under construction. Abstract numbers have become a reality before our eyes." The Indian delegation to the World People's Peace Congress, which had visited the Lenin Volga-Don Canal, pointed out in their impressions of their visit to the Soviet Union: the Soviet construction projects deeply moved the representatives. They saw that the vast swamps of the past had been drained. Hundreds of thousands of hectares of arid land had been transformed into rice paddies and lush orchards due to the construction of huge irrigation systems. The British trade union delegation and the Danish workers' delegation had examined in detail the working conditions, the degree of mechanization, and the social welfare measures of many factories in the Soviet Union. They asserted that the degree of mechanization of production in Soviet factories was comparable to that of any country in the world. The Danish workers' delegation believed that the Soviet Union's social insurance system was much more developed than that of Denmark.

    Delegations from various countries also witnessed firsthand the happy lives and new social outlook of the Soviet working people. After practical investigation, the Austrian workers' delegation believed that prices in the Soviet Union were much lower than in their country. The Dutch youth delegation believed that the actual wages of Soviet workers had increased by almost forty percent due to various free services alone. The Brazilian trade union delegation traveled through the rural areas of the Armenian Republic, where the happy lives of the farmers reminded them of the profound suffering currently experienced by Brazilian farmers. When the Finnish workers' delegation visited a Georgian collective farm and saw the farm members buying cars and building beautiful houses, the representatives believed that only the collective farm system could ensure that farmers lead a prosperous life.

    Delegations from various countries also examined the Soviet Union's cultural and educational system. The high cultural level and new communist moral qualities of the Soviet people left them with unforgettable impressions. The Brazilian trade union delegation, the Danish women's delegation, and the Swedish-Soviet Association delegation saw during their visits that Soviet people could receive a good education, and that factories, enterprises, and rural areas also implemented after-work education to help workers and farmers improve their cultural and technical levels. They believed that these were simply inconceivable for the working people of the capitalist world. The British cultural delegation, during its visit to the Central Asian republics, was very impressed by the achievements of these republics in developing culture and science and technology. In addition, many representatives also realized that the Soviet people under the socialist system all possessed new moral qualities of loving labor, loving the motherland, loving mankind, and being optimistic and upward-looking, which stood in stark contrast to the various phenomena of moral decay that permeated capitalist countries.

    From the booming national economy of the Soviet Union and from the continuous improvement of the material and cultural welfare of the people, delegations from various countries also deeply realized the Soviet Union's consistent and unwavering implementation of a peaceful policy. Many delegations said in their impressions of their visit to the Soviet Union that "peace" and "friendship among all nations" were among the most important issues of concern to the Soviet people. They never saw any signs of propaganda for war or hostility towards other countries in the Soviet Union. The Austrian workers' delegation believed: "The lies and slanders about the Soviet Union that are spread daily by Austrian and foreign newspapers and radio stations cannot withstand the rebuttal of Soviet reality." The representatives of various countries believe that it is their noble responsibility to tell the truth about the Soviet Union to the working people of their own countries.

    五十六国的代表团今年访问苏联
    他们一致赞扬苏联的和平建设与和平政策
    【新华社二十八日讯】一九五三年各国人民纷纷派遣代表团到苏联参观访问。据不完全统计，在今年头十一个月中，已有五十六个国家的一百一十多个代表团访问了苏联。其中除了中华人民共和国、德意志民主共和国和其他人民民主国家的代表团以外，还有英国、法国、意大利、日本、印度、伊朗、突尼斯、瑞士、挪威、加拿大、巴西、智利等资本主义国家和殖民地国家的各种代表团。这些代表团由不同职业、不同政治和宗教信仰的人组成。经过参观访问，他们更进一步了解了苏联的真相，而这些真相，在资本主义世界正是被无数诽谤和谎言所蒙蔽着的。
    各国访苏代表团在苏联都得到充分的机会进行参观访问。他们访问了城市和乡村，参观了工厂、矿山和集体农庄。有些代表团还游览了列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河。许多来自资本主义国家的代表们在参观后都说，苏联的现实比他们原先想像的还要好；苏联在各方面的巨大成就，在资本主义国家是不可想像的。奥地利工人代表团和挪威工人代表团在苏联各地参观时，都称羡苏联建设的巨大规模，把苏联称为“一个巨大的建设工地”。法国工会代表团团员马·日伯兰在苏联参观访问后认为，任何从一个经济停滞、经常感受到失业威胁的国家来到苏联的人，都为苏联的经济高涨而感到特别吃惊，那是毫不足怪的。他说：“我们看见许许多多的工厂、桥梁和公寓房屋正在建筑中。抽象的数字在我们眼前已变成了现实。”曾经参观过列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河的印度出席世界人民和平大会代表团，在访苏观感中指出：苏联的建设工程使代表们非常感动。他们看到过去的广大沼泽地带已经把水排除。以前的几十万公顷干旱的土地，由于建筑了巨大的灌溉系统，已变成了稻田和繁茂的果园。英国工会代表团和丹麦工人代表团曾经详细地考察过苏联许多工厂的劳动条件、机械化程度和社会福利措施。他们断言，苏联工厂生产的机械化程度，可以同世界上任何一个国家相媲美。丹麦工人代表团认为，苏联的社会保险制度要比丹麦发达得多。
    各国代表团还亲眼看到了苏联劳动人民的幸福生活和新的社会面貌。经过实际考察后，奥地利工人代表团认为，苏联的物价要比他们国家低得多。荷兰青年代表团认为，仅由于各种免费事业，苏联工人的实际工资差不多提高了百分之四十。巴西工会代表团游历了亚美尼亚共和国的农村，那儿农民的幸福生活，使他们想起了目前巴西农民所遭遇的深重苦难。芬兰工人代表团参观一个格鲁吉亚集体农庄时，看到该农庄庄员购买汽车，建造漂亮的住宅，代表们认为，只有集体农庄制度才能确保农民过富裕的生活。
    各国代表团还考察了苏联的文化教育制度。苏联人民高度的文化水平和新的共产主义道德品质，给他们留下了难忘的印象。巴西工会代表团、丹麦妇女代表团、瑞（典）苏协会代表团在访问期间，看到苏联人都能受到很好的教育，工厂企业和农村还实施业余教育帮助工人、农民提高文化和技术水平。它们认为这些对资本主义世界的劳动人民来说简直是不可思议的事。英国文化代表团在参观中亚细亚各加盟共和国时，对这些共和国在发展文化和科学技术方面的成就非常钦佩。此外，许多代表还认识到，在社会主义制度下的苏联人民，都具有爱劳动、爱祖国、爱人类和乐观向上的新的道德品质，而这些品质是与资本主义国家充塞着的道德堕落的种种现象，恰成一强烈的对比。
    各国代表团从苏联国民经济的高涨中，从人民的物质和文化福利的不断增进中，还深切地认识到苏联一贯坚持不渝地执行的和平政策。许多代表团在访苏观感中都说，“和平”与“各民族友谊”是苏联人民最关心的重要问题之一。他们在苏联从没有看到任何宣传战争或仇视其他国家的迹象。奥地利工人代表团认为：“奥地利和外国的报纸和电台天天所散播的关于苏联的谎言和诽谤，都经不起苏联现实的反驳。”各国代表认为，把苏联的真相告诉给本国的劳动人民，是他们的崇高的责任。
