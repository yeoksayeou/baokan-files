    The Wheat in Two Fields Grows Differently
    By Our Reporter  Lü Jianzhong
    On the north side of the road in Mazhuang Village, Wen County, Henan Province, there are two adjacent wheat fields. The wheat seedlings in one field are growing strong and robust, while the wheat seedlings in the other field are growing yellow, thin, and withered.
    Same soil, same variety, why do the wheat in the two fields grow differently? Passers-by always want to find out the reason.
    It turns out that the fertile and robust wheat field belongs to Ma Jiuxiao, the head of the mutual aid group. His experience is: "Hoarding grain for lending is not as good as buying manure to apply to the land." Last year, after harvesting wheat, he sold 400 catties of wheat to the state. After the autumn harvest, he and the members of the group, according to the contract, used 4,000 catties of millet and corn to exchange for fertilizer and living materials at the supply and marketing cooperative. In addition, they also repaired wells and borrowed waterwheels. Last year, when planting wheat, they applied sufficient farmyard manure, bone meal, and wood ash, and also used soybean cake as top dressing, and watered the fields.
    In January of this year, his mutual aid group expanded into a cooperative, and the production conditions are even better. When the wheat turned green, they applied superphosphate as top dressing and watered it again, and the wheat seedlings grew very strong.
    The other wheat field belongs to Guo Nan, who is farming independently. He hoards grain and doesn't buy fertilizer. He plants more than ten mu of wheat, but his labor is insufficient. The wheat lacks fertilizer and water, and the cultivation is rough. The wheat seedlings grow yellow and thin, like a sick person.
    In mid-April, there was a sudden heavy frost. The wheat planted by Ma Jiuxiao had strong disaster resistance. In addition, the cooperative was "strong and well-equipped." The waterwheels rattled as they watered the fields, and they applied ammonium sulfate as top dressing. The wheat was quickly saved, and the yield was 500 catties per mu. Guo Nan's wheat could not withstand the frost, and the seedlings slowly withered. He wanted to water the fields, but he lacked manpower and had no waterwheel. Not long after, there was a rain, and the wheat sprouted new buds, but the yield was only 110 catties per mu.
    This year, Guo Nan's attitude towards planting wheat is different. The cooperative plants densely, so he also plants densely. The cooperative digs irrigation ditches, and he also digs irrigation ditches. When the cooperative built new wells and added waterwheels, he quickly asked to join in.
    Now the farmers in Mazhuang understand that to increase grain production, they must organize, improve labor efficiency and production technology. When they have grain, they must sell it to the state to support the country's industrial construction, so that workers can manufacture more waterwheels and fertilizer powder.
    Faced with the facts, Guo Nan has also begun to think about this issue.

### 两块田的小麦长得不一样

    两块田的小麦长得不一样
    本报记者  吕建中
    河南温县马庄村北大路边并摆着两块小麦田，一块田里的麦苗长的肥壮结实，一块田里的麦苗长的黄瘦枯萎。
    同样土质，同样品种，为什么两块田的小麦长的不一样？过路的人们总想追究一下原因。
    原来那块肥壮结实的麦田是互助组组长马九宵种的。他的经验是：“囤粮放账，不如买粪往地里上。”去年收完麦，他卖给国家四百斤小麦，收罢秋，又和全组的人，按照合同用四千斤谷子和玉米，到供销合作社换回来肥料和生活资料，另外还修了水井，贷了水车。去年种麦，厩肥、骨粉、草木灰施的很足，还用豆饼做追肥，同时又浇了水。
    今年一月，他的互助组又扩大成合作社，生产条件更优越了，小麦返青的时候，再追施一次过磷酸钙，浇一次水，麦苗长得十分肥壮。
    另外一块麦田是单干户郭南种的。他放着粮食，不买肥，种十多亩麦，劳力又不足，小麦少肥缺水，耕作粗糙，麦苗长的又黄又瘦，好像有病的人一样。
    四月中旬突然降了一场大霜，马九宵种的麦子抗灾力强，加上合作社“兵强马壮”，水车辘轳呼啦啦地浇水，再追施一次硫酸錏，小麦很快就救活了。结果每亩收五百斤。郭南的麦子抗不住霜，麦苗慢慢地枯萎了，浇水吧，人手不足，又没有水车。过了不久落了一场雨，小麦发了新芽，结果每亩只收一百一十斤。
    今年种麦，郭南的态度不一样了，合作社密植，他就密植，合作社打浇水畦，他也打浇水畦，到了合作社砌新井，添水车，他又连忙要求入上了一股。
    现在马庄的农民们都明白了，要增产粮食，就得组织起来，提高劳动效率和生产技术，有了粮食就得卖给国家，支援国家工业建设，让工人多制造水车和肥田粉。
    郭南在事实面前，也开始想到这个问题。
