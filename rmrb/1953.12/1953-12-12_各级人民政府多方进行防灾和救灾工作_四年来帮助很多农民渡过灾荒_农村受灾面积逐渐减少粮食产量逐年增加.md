People's governments at all levels have done a lot of disaster prevention and relief work in rural areas, providing relief and assistance in various ways since the founding of the People's Republic of China. This has enabled farmers in disaster areas to successfully overcome famine. In addition, various other measures have been taken to gradually reduce the area affected by disasters and increase grain production year by year throughout the country.

The rural disaster relief work over the past four years has been carried out under the policy of "production for self-relief, thrift for overcoming famine, mutual assistance among the masses, supplemented by necessary government relief." In order to support agricultural production in disaster areas, the people's governments have helped disaster-stricken farmers solve difficulties in seeds, fertilizers, and the protection of draft animals. In the autumn of 1950, the Huai River basin suffered a flood. In order to help disaster victims rush to plant high-yield and early-maturing crops and solve the difficulties of overcoming famine, the relevant departments of the Central People's Government went to Shandong, Hebei, Suiyuan and other places to purchase more than 11 million jin of late autumn crop seeds such as potatoes, rapeseed, and buckwheat, planting more than 7 million mu, and harvested more than 400 million jin in total. The disaster victims relied on these late autumn crops to overcome the famine. This spring, Henan, Anhui and other places suffered frost damage. The people's government timely allocated more than 300 million jin of seeds to the disaster areas, solving the spring sowing difficulties. In the autumn, some areas of Hebei and Shandong experienced floods. The government allocated another 450 million jin of wheat seeds, enabling the disaster-stricken areas to complete the autumn sowing task in a timely manner. In terms of fertilizer, the amount lent to the disaster areas in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces alone this year reached more than 380 million jin. In order to protect draft animals in disaster areas, the government also helped farmers in disaster areas solve difficulties such as cattle grass and the prevention and control of animal diseases. Taking the Wanbei area as an example, after the flood in 1950, farmers generally lacked fuel and feed. In order to save grass and feed for livestock, the people's government allocated more than 120 million jin of relief coal to the area, and also allocated more than 6.6 million jin of relief grain for livestock. Last year, draft animals in the area suffered from anthrax and emphysema and other epidemics. The people's government timely allocated more than 4.1 billion yuan for animal disease prevention and control, so that the animal epidemic could be stopped from developing.

The people's government has also done a lot of work in supporting sideline production of farmers in disaster areas and solving problems such as funds and sales channels. For example, in 1950 alone, the industrial and commercial and cooperative departments in Shandong Province spent more than 400 million jin of grain to help farmers in disaster areas solve the difficulty of lacking funds, enabling farmers to obtain 500 to 600 million jin of food in sideline production. This year, in order to help farmers in Hebei Province solve the sales problem of sideline production, the relevant departments have signed purchase and sales contracts with other places with a total value of more than 260 billion yuan, enabling the masses in disaster areas to carry out sideline production in a planned manner. Under the vigorous call and promotion of the people's government, mass thrift campaigns to overcome famine have also been launched in disaster-stricken areas. For example, the masses in Shanzhou Prefecture, Henan Province, stored wild vegetables alone worth more than 80 million jin of grain when they suffered famine in 1950, solving the difficulties of 40% of the grain-deficient households in the entire prefecture. In the same year, the cadres of the people's government launched a campaign to save one or two liang of rice per day to support the disaster victims in overcoming the famine. The central government agencies alone saved more than 410,000 jin of grain, more than 3.3 billion yuan, and more than 77,000 pieces of clothing. Combining the development of agricultural production to solve the livelihood difficulties of farmers in disaster areas, the people's government has also held various work-relief projects. Last year, the central government allocated 200 billion yuan to Hubei Province for work-relief, helping farmers build more than 6,000 farmland water conservancy projects, enabling nearly 3 million mu of farmland to be irrigated and free from drought. The year before last, 249 million jin of relief grain and work-relief grain and more than 41.9 million jin of loan grain were allocated to the former Chahar Province, organizing farmers in disaster areas to dig 12,000 wells, complete more than 400 large and small canals, and build more than 3,700 li of roads.

The people's government has given more support to farmers in severely affected areas and some elderly, weak, disabled, and widowed farmers who have no ability to produce. In 1950, a total of 6.88 million sets of winter clothes were collected across the country and distributed to farmers in severely affected areas, and more than 13 million jin of food for house repair subsidies were allocated to Wanbei, and more than 16 million jin of salt were allocated to disaster areas in Wanbei, Subei, and other places to solve the difficulties of disaster victims. The Central Ministry of Health also sent six epidemic prevention teams with more than 700 medical personnel, carrying more than nine tons of medicine, to various disaster areas to provide free medical treatment for farmers. In terms of grain supply for grain-deficient farmers in disaster areas, in 1950, 1.53 million tons of grain were transferred from Northeast China, Sichuan, and Central South China to disaster areas in East China and North China. This year, more than 1.9 billion jin of grain were transferred from Southwest China, Northeast China, and other places to frost-stricken areas. The people's governments in disaster-stricken areas made more efforts to ensure that grain was delivered to the disaster victims as soon as possible. This spring, Anhui Province rushed to build four grain transport roads, and Nanyang Prefecture in Henan Province dispatched 120 trucks and more than 1,000 horse-drawn carts to transport grain. In terms of reducing the burden on farmers in disaster areas, in addition to the provisions in the agricultural tax collection methods, the People's Bank of China has also formulated methods for repaying loans in disaster areas this year, and reduced and exempted more than 560 billion yuan of various loans owed by severely affected areas over the years. In terms of agricultural tax reduction and exemption, Henan Province alone had more than 760 million jin in this summer's collection.

In the period of reactionary rule in our country, no one cared about disasters in rural areas, and the deaths of disaster victims and the abandonment of land were appalling. According to statistics from 1920 to 1936 alone, the number of disaster victims who died reached more than 18 million, and in 1930, more than 1.1 billion mu of farmland was abandoned. Since the founding of the new China, the people's government has carried out a lot of disaster prevention and relief work in rural areas, greatly reducing natural disasters and increasing grain production year by year. For example, if the area of land affected by disasters in the country in 1949 is 100, it has been reduced to 60 in 1950, 44 in 1951, 52 last year, and will be smaller than 1949 this year. Grain production was 100 in 1949, 117 in 1950, 128 in 1951, and 145 last year. Although some areas suffered more severely this year, the national grain production is basically not lower than last year.

    各级人民政府多方进行防灾和救灾工作
    四年来帮助很多农民渡过灾荒
    农村受灾面积逐渐减少粮食产量逐年增加
    自中华人民共和国成立以来，各级人民政府在各地农村中做了很多防灾和救灾工作，从各方面进行救济和扶助，使受灾农民胜利渡过灾荒，再加上其他种种措施，已在全国范围内使受灾面积逐渐缩小，粮食产量逐年增加。
    四年来的农村灾荒救济工作是在“生产自救、节约渡荒、群众互助、并辅以政府必要救济”的方针下进行的。为了支持灾区农业生产，人民政府帮助受灾农民解决了种籽、肥料以及保护耕畜等方面的困难。一九五○年秋天淮河流域遭受了水灾，为了帮助灾民抢种多产早熟作物，解决渡荒困难，中央人民政府各有关部门曾到山东、河北、绥远等地购买马铃薯、油菜、荞麦等晚秋作物种籽一千一百余万斤，播种了七百多万亩，共收获四亿多斤，灾民靠着这些晚秋作物渡过了灾荒。今春河南、安徽等地遭受霜灾，人民政府及时向灾区调剂了三亿多斤种籽，解决了春播困难。秋季河北、山东部分地区发生水灾，政府又调剂了四亿五千余万斤麦种，使受灾地区及时完成秋播任务。在肥料方面，仅今年贷给河北、山东、河南三省灾区的即达三亿八千余万斤。为了保护灾区耕畜，政府还帮助灾区农民解决牛草和兽疫防治等困难。以皖北地区来说，一九五○年水灾后，农民普遍缺乏燃料和饲料，为了节约草料喂养牲畜，人民政府曾拨给该区救济煤一亿二千余万斤，同时又拨给该区牲畜救济粮六百六十多万斤。去年该区耕畜患炭疽及气肿疽等疫病，人民政府又及时拨出兽疫防治费四十一亿余元，使畜疫得以停止发展。
    人民政府在支持灾区农民副业生产，解决资金、销路等问题上也做了许多工作。如一九五○年山东省仅工商、合作部门就支出粮食四亿余斤，帮助灾区农民解决资金缺乏的困难，使农民在副业生产中获得食粮五、六亿斤。河北省今年为了帮助农民解决副业生产的销路问题，有关部门已和外地订立总值二千六百多亿元的购销合同，使灾区群众能有计划地进行副业生产。在人民政府大力号召和提倡之下，受灾地区还开展了群众性的节约渡荒运动。如河南陕州专区群众，在一九五○年遭到灾荒时，仅储存野菜一项即折粮八千多万斤，解决了全专区百分之四十的缺粮户困难。同年，人民政府的机关干部为了支援灾民渡荒，展开了每天节约一两米运动。仅中央各机关即节约了粮食四十一万余斤、款三十三亿余元、衣物七万七千余件。结合发展农业生产，解决灾区农民生活困难，人民政府还举办了各种工赈工程。去年，中央拨给湖北省以工代赈款二千亿元，帮助农民兴修了农田水利工程六千多处，使近三百万亩农田得到灌溉，免除旱灾。前年拨给前察哈尔省的救济粮及以工代赈粮二亿四千九百多万斤、贷粮四千一百九十多万斤，组织灾区农民打井一万二千眼，完成大小渠道四百余条，修筑道路三千七百余里。
    对于重灾区以及一些无生产能力的孤老残疾的农民，人民政府更给以大力支持，一九五○年共在全国募集寒衣六百八十八万套，发给重灾区农民，并拨给皖北修房补助粮一千三百余万斤，又拨了食盐一千六百多万斤给皖北、苏北等地灾区，解决灾民困难。中央卫生部并派出六个防疫大队七百多个医务人员，携带九吨多重的药品，分赴各灾区为农民进行免费医疗。在灾区缺粮农民的粮食供应方面，一九五○年从东北、四川、中南等地调往华东、华北灾区的粮食即达一百五十三万吨，今年从西南、东北等地调到霜灾地区的粮食也有十九亿多斤，遭灾地区人民政府更多方设法使粮食尽快运到灾民手中。今春安徽省赶修运粮公路四条，河南省南阳专区出动汽车一百二十辆、马车一千多辆赶运粮食。对减轻灾区农民负担方面，除农业税征收办法中所规定的以外，中国人民银行今年又制订了灾区贷款的归还办法，并减免重灾区历年积欠的各种贷款五千六百余亿元。农业税减免方面，仅河南省今年夏征中即有七亿六千余万斤。
    我国农村在反动统治时期，灾荒根本无人过问，灾民死亡和土地荒芜是十分惊人的。仅据一九二○年到一九三六年十六年间的统计，灾民死亡达一千八百余万人，一九三○年田地荒芜达十一亿多亩。自新中国成立以后，人民政府在农村中进行了许多防灾和救灾工作，使自然灾害大大缩小，粮食生产逐年增加。如以一九四九年全国受灾土地面积为一百，则一九五○年已缩小到六十，一九五一年为四十四，去年为五十二，今年也小于一九四九年。粮食产量以一九四九年为一百，一九五○年则为一百一十七，一九五一年为一百二十八，去年为一百四十五，今年虽有部分地区受灾较重，全国的粮食产量也基本上不低于去年。
