Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 13th. (Special correspondent Jiang Nan) After U.S. representative Dean unilaterally interrupted the bilateral talks on the political conference issue according to the pre-arranged plan, he hypocritically complained to the world that the Korean and Chinese side "accused my government of bad faith," thus "forcing" him to withdraw from the meeting. At the same time, the lackey in London immediately came out to chime in, complaining that the Korean and Chinese side's mention of the U.S. side's connivance with Syngman Rhee in forcibly detaining more than 27,000 prisoners of war was "simply inexplicable." This trick is obviously intended to deceive world public opinion and shirk the responsibility of the U.S. side for sabotaging the bilateral talks.

But the clumsiness of this trick is obvious. What exactly "forced" Dean to interrupt the bilateral talks? Dulles knows this question better. After the adjournment of the Eighth UN General Assembly and the end of the Bermuda Conference, news came from Washington that Dean would end the talks and return home. Dean pretended that he didn't know about this. Then Dean admitted that he had received new instructions from Dulles, which reportedly ordered him to use all "possible" means—that is, to insist on his so-called "final proposal"—to enable the political conference to be held. Now facts have proved that Dulles's new instructions were originally to order Dean to use all "possible" means to sabotage the talks, so that Syngman Rhee could forcibly detain prisoners of war, thereby maintaining tension in Korea and the Far East. All the U.S. side's soothing rhetoric about hoping to convene a political conference, from Bermuda to Washington to Panmunjom, was just a smokescreen to cover up this conspiracy. Obviously, what "forced" Dean to interrupt the talks was not the accusations of the Korean and Chinese side, but the United States' despicable "Cold War" policy.

It was precisely to implement this shameful policy that Dean, after putting forward his so-called "final proposal" on December 8, unreasonably and repeatedly forced the Korean and Chinese side to sign this "proposal." Dean's use of such extremely rude and provocative means was obviously an attempt to arouse the indignation of the Korean and Chinese representatives, so as to take the opportunity to interrupt the negotiations. However, the Korean and Chinese representatives saw through Dean's conspiracy and pointed out the extreme unreasonableness of Dean's so-called "final proposal" with a calm and patient attitude, especially asking Dean to answer: whether all the decisions of the political conference are binding on Syngman Rhee. At the meeting on the 12th, Dean still could not answer this question. He only repeatedly proposed "recess" until the end, finally using the excuse that the Korean and Chinese side accused the U.S. side of bad faith in conniving with Syngman Rhee to forcibly detain prisoners of war to propose an "indefinite recess," and like Harrison interrupted the armistice negotiations on October 8 last year, he left the meeting without waiting for our side to speak, thus fulfilling the dishonorable task given to him by Dulles.

Dean said that the accusations of the Korean and Chinese side were "inaccurate," but he did not dare to further explain why they were "inaccurate." The whole world knows that the agreement on the prisoner of war issue was signed by U.S. General Harrison on June 8, and Harrison claimed to represent the seventeen countries of the U.S. side, including South Korea. Ten days after the signing of this agreement, Syngman Rhee's army forcibly detained more than 27,000 prisoners of war in the name of "release," and another U.S. General Clark, acting as the Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces, admitted on June 21 that he had "complete command" over all of Syngman Rhee's troops. Earlier, the U.S. State Department stated more clearly in its note inviting Switzerland to participate in the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission: "...These prisoners of war are not detained by any one belligerent country, but by the Headquarters of the United Nations Command, and only the Headquarters of the United Nations Command is responsible for the control and security of all prisoners of war." Everyone knows that the so-called Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Forces is actually the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Forces in the Far East, and the so-called Headquarters of the United Nations Command is the U.S. Army Far East Command. A U.S. general signed an agreement on the prisoner of war issue, and another U.S. general then allowed Syngman Rhee's army under his jurisdiction to effortlessly escort away more than 27,000 prisoners of war. What is this if not the bad faith of the U.S. government? Precisely because this is an undeniable act of bad faith, when General Nam Il stated on July 19 that our side reserved the right to submit this issue for discussion at the political conference, Harrison, who was even better at lying and denying than Dean, did not dare to object. Therefore, the accusations of the Korean and Chinese side are accurate and cannot be denied.

Now Dean is trying to overturn the verdict, refusing to admit this perfidious act of the U.S. government, and using this as an excuse to interrupt the bilateral talks. The barbaric and unreasonable nature of this is very obvious. At the same time, he himself is acting perfidiously again, saying that this issue should be written off and not mentioned again. All this foreshadows that the U.S. government will have even more serious acts of bad faith. U.S. representative Harrison personally guaranteed on July 16 before the armistice: "We have obtained the necessary guarantees from the Government of the Republic of Korea that it will not obstruct the implementation of the terms of the draft armistice agreement in any way." On July 11, he also guaranteed: "The United Nations Command will not support any aggressive act by the Republic of Korea that undermines the armistice." On July 13, he further guaranteed that if Syngman Rhee undermines the armistice, takes aggressive actions, and the Korean and Chinese side takes necessary actions to resist aggression and ensure the armistice, the United Nations Command will remain in a state of armistice. However, Syngman Rhee is now clamoring to undermine the armistice agreement, plunder prisoners of war, and clamoring for "northward unification," and the United States is not only not stopping him, but is actively supporting him. This proves that the United States is attempting to once again renege on its own guarantees and put the Korean armistice in a dangerous situation. If the U.S. government does not immediately resume the bilateral talks, then it will never escape the responsibility for sabotaging the political conference and sabotaging the Korean armistice agreement.

The current situation in Korea is serious. The U.S. side's unilateral interruption of the bilateral talks has opened the way for Syngman Rhee to forcibly detain prisoners of war and undermine the armistice. The seriousness of the consequences arising therefrom should absolutely not be underestimated. The British government's support for the U.S. destructive tactics is completely an act of accomplice.

### 美国的“冷战”政策是美方中断会谈的原因  迪安任何藉口都不能推卸破坏会谈的责任

    美国的“冷战”政策是美方中断会谈的原因
    迪安任何藉口都不能推卸破坏会谈的责任
    【新华社开城十三日电】本社特派记者江南报道：美国代表迪安在按照预定计划片面中断关于政治会议问题的双方会谈之后，向全世界假惺惺地哭诉说朝中方面“指责我的政府背信”，因此“迫使”他退出了会议。同时伦敦的小伙计立刻出来帮腔，埋怨朝中方面提起美方纵容李承晚强迫扣留二万七千余名战俘的事情“简直是莫名其妙”。这一套把戏显然是为了欺骗世界舆论，推卸美方破坏双方会谈的责任。
    但是这一套把戏的拙劣是显而易见的。究竟是什么东西“迫使”迪安中断了双方会谈？这个问题杜勒斯知道得更清楚些。在第八届联合国大会休会和百慕大会议结束以后，华盛顿就传出了迪安将要结束会谈返国的消息，迪安还装腔作势地说他不知道有这回事。接着迪安就承认他已经接到了杜勒斯的新的指示，据说这个指示命令他用一切“可能的”办法——就是坚持他的所谓“最后的建议”——来使政治会议得以召开。现在事实证明，杜勒斯的新指示原来就是要迪安用一切“可能的”办法破坏会谈，使李承晚得以强迫扣留战俘，借以在朝鲜和远东保持紧张局势。而从百慕大、华盛顿一直到板门店，美方的一切关于希望召开政治会议的笼络人心的论调，都只是遮掩这个阴谋的烟幕。很明显，“迫使”迪安中断会谈的并不是朝中方面的指责，而是美国的卑鄙的“冷战”政策。
    正是为了执行这个可耻的政策，迪安在十二月八日提出他的所谓“最后的建议”以后，就横蛮无理地一再强迫朝中方面在这个“建议”上面签字。迪安使用这种极端无礼的挑衅手段，显然是企图激起朝中代表的愤慨，以便乘机中断谈判。但是朝中代表识破了迪安的这个阴谋，用冷静而耐心的态度指出迪安的所谓“最后的建议”中的极不合理的地方，特别要求迪安回答：政治会议的一切决定对于李承晚是否具有约束力。在十二日会议上，迪安仍然不能回答这个问题。他只是一次又一次地提议“休会”，直到最后，终于藉口朝中方面指责美方纵容李承晚强迫扣留战俘的背信行为而提出“无限期休会”，像哈利逊在去年十月八日中断停战谈判一样，不等我方发言就退出会场，这样实现了杜勒斯所交给他的不名誉的任务。
      迪安说朝中方面的指责是“不确实的”，可是他不敢进一步说明为什么是“不确实的”。全世界都知道，关于战俘问题的协议是在六月八日由美国将军哈利逊签字的，而哈利逊自称是代表包括南朝鲜在内的美方十七个国家的。在这个协议签字以后十天，李承晚的军队就以“释放”为名强迫扣留了二万七千余名战俘，而另一个充当联合国军总司令的美国将军克拉克在六月二十一日承认，他对李承晚的一切部队“有着完全的指挥权”。更早些时候，美国国务院在邀请瑞士参加中立国遣返委员会的照会中更明白地说：“……这些战俘并不是由任何一个交战国家拘押的，而是由联合国军总司令部拘押的，唯有联合国军司令部负责所有战俘的管制和警卫工作。”任何人都知道的事实是：所谓联合国军总司令实际上就是远东美军总司令，所谓联合国军司令部就是美军远东司令部。一个美国将军在战俘问题协议上签字，另一个美国将军随即让他所管辖的李承晚的军队不费吹灰之力地押走二万七千余名战俘，这不是美国政府的背信行为是什么？正因为这是无可抵赖的背信行为，所以当七月十九日南日大将声明我方保留将这个问题提交政治会议讨论的时候，比迪安更擅长撒谎抵赖的哈利逊也不敢提出反对。因此，朝中方面的指责是确实的，是不容抵赖的。
    现在迪安却企图出来做翻案文章，拒绝承认美国政府这一背信弃义的行为，并且以此为藉口中断双方会谈，其横蛮无理的性质是十分明显的。同时他自己竟又背信弃义地说，这个问题要把它一笔勾销，不应重提。这一切预兆着美国政府将有更严重的背信弃义的行为。美国代表哈利逊在停战以前的七月十六日曾经亲口保证：“我们已从大韩民国政府获得必要的保证，即：它将不以任何方式阻挠停战协定草案条款的实施。”七月十一日，他又保证：
  “大韩民国进行任何破坏停战的侵略行为时，联合国军将不予以支持。”七月十三日，他又保证在李承晚破坏停战、采取侵略行动，而朝中方面采取必要行动抵抗侵略、保障停战时，联合国军将仍保持停战状态。但是李承晚现在正在叫嚣着要破坏停战协定，劫夺战俘，并且叫嚣要“北进统一”，而美国不但不予以制止，反而予以积极支持。这证明美国企图再次背弃它自己所作的保证，而陷朝鲜停战于危险的境地。如果美国政府不立即恢复双方会谈，那末它决不能逃脱破坏政治会议、破坏朝鲜停战协定的责任。
      朝鲜目前的局势是严重的。美方片面中断双方会谈，已经为李承晚强迫扣留战俘、破坏停战打开了道路。绝对不应低估由此而引起的后果的严重性。英国政府为美国的破坏手段捧场，完全是帮凶行为。
