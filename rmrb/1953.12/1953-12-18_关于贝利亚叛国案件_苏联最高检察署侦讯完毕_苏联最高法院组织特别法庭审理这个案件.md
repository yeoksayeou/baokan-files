Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 17th: TASS Moscow, December 17th - On June 26, 1953, after examining the report of the Soviet Council of Ministers on the criminal activities of L.P. Beria, an agent of foreign capital, aimed at undermining the Soviet state, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR decided to remove L.P. Beria from his position as First Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers and Minister of Internal Affairs of the USSR, and to submit his case to the court for trial. The Supreme Soviet of the USSR approved the resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of June 26 on August 8, 1953.

Now, the Supreme Procuracy of the USSR has completed the investigation of the case of the traitor to the motherland, L.P. Beria.

The investigation has determined that Beria, taking advantage of his position, organized a treasonous group of conspirators hostile to the Soviet state. The criminal aim of this group, for the benefit of foreign capital, was to use the central and local organs of the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs to oppose the Communist Party and the Soviet government. They insidiously attempted to place the Ministry of Internal Affairs above the Party and the government, in order to seize power and disintegrate the worker-peasant Soviet system, so as to achieve the restoration of capitalism and the restoration of the rule of the bourgeoisie. The following defendants, who for many years engaged in criminal activities with Beria in the People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs and later in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, were active participants in this treasonous group of conspirators: V.N. Merkulov, former Minister of State Security of the USSR, later Minister of State Control of the USSR; V.G. Dekanozov, former Director of the People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs of the USSR, later Minister of Internal Affairs of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic; B.Z. Kobulov, former Deputy People's Commissar of Internal Affairs of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, former Deputy Minister of State Security of the USSR, later Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs of the USSR; S.A. Goglidze, former People's Commissar of Internal Affairs of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, later Director of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the USSR; P.Y. Meshik, former Director of the People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs of the USSR, later Minister of Internal Affairs of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic; L.E. Vlodzimirsky, former Director of the Investigation Department for Especially Important Cases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the USSR.

For many years, Beria and his accomplices carefully disguised and concealed their hostile treasonous activities. After the death of J.V. Stalin, the reactionary imperialist forces intensified their activities to subvert the Soviet state. Thereupon, Beria began to intensify his activities in order to achieve his criminal aims. He first used the organs of the Ministry of Internal Affairs to seize power, which quickly exposed the true face of this traitor to the motherland, enabling the Party and the government to take firm measures to liquidate his hostile activities.

In March 1953, after Beria became Minister of Internal Affairs of the USSR, he did everything in his power to install members of his conspiracy group in leading positions in the Ministry of Internal Affairs. These conspirators squeezed out and persecuted honest personnel in the Ministry of Internal Affairs who refused to carry out Beria's criminal instructions.

In order to undermine the collective farm system and create difficulties in our country's food supply, Beria did everything possible to sabotage and obstruct the implementation of the most important resolutions formulated by the Party and the government, which were aimed at developing the economy of collective farms and state farms and continuously improving the welfare of the Soviet people. It has now been determined that Beria and his accomplices took criminal measures, attempting to restore the remnants of bourgeois nationalists in the various Union republics, create hostility and hatred among the various nationalities of the Soviet Union, and first and foremost, undermine the friendship between the various nationalities of the Soviet Union and the great Russian people.

Since Beria and his accomplices had no social base within the country, they placed their criminal hopes on the support of foreign reactionary imperialist forces.

The investigation has determined that Beria first colluded with foreign intelligence agencies during the Civil War period. In 1919, Beria committed treason in Baku: he worked as an agent in the intelligence agency of the Azerbaijani Musavat counter-revolutionary government, which was controlled by British intelligence agencies. In 1920, Beria committed treason for the second time in Georgia: he established secret contacts with the Georgian Menshevik secret police, which was a branch of British intelligence agencies.

The investigation has determined that in later years, Beria continued to maintain and expand his secret criminal contacts with these foreign intelligence agencies through spies of foreign intelligence agencies. He repeatedly tried to prevent these spies from being exposed and from receiving the punishment they deserved.

The traitor to the motherland and the spy who sold himself to foreign intelligence agencies, Beria, throughout his criminal activities, with the help of his accomplices, also maintained secret contacts with counter-revolutionary Georgian Menshevik émigrés and spies of some foreign intelligence agencies.

Beria meticulously concealed and covered up his criminal history and treasonous collusion with foreign intelligence agencies. The main means he used was to falsely accuse, plot against, and use various methods of framing loyal Party and Soviet officials who hindered his anti-Soviet state criminal conspiracies and hindered his seizure of power.

Beria and his accomplices used these criminal means to seize important positions in Transcaucasia and Georgia, and later seized important positions in the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs, and plotted a treasonous conspiracy to seize power. In order to eliminate those who did not suit their wishes, they did not hesitate to take arbitrary and illegal actions, and despicably deceived the Party and the state.

The investigation also revealed a series of criminal conspiracies carried out by Beria in order to achieve his ambitious goals and prevent his true face as an enemy from being exposed. For example, the investigation has determined that in order to achieve his criminal goals, Beria, with the help of his accomplices, planned and carried out many years of criminal conspiracy activities against the outstanding activist of the Communist Party and the Soviet state, Sergo Ordzhonikidze, whom he considered an obstacle to his further advancement and realization of his hostile conspiracy. It has now been determined that Sergo Ordzhonikidze had suspected Beria's political face. After Sergo Ordzhonikidze's death, these conspirators continued to carry out cruel retaliation against his family.

The results of the investigation also determined the facts of assassination activities carried out by the conspirators out of fear of being exposed. For example, Beria and his accomplices murdered M.S. Kedrov—who joined the Communist Party in 1902 and served as a member of the Presidium of the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution and Sabotage led by F.E. Dzerzhinsky, and a member of the board of the State Unified Political Administration. The reason why the conspirators wanted to murder Kedrov was because they suspected that he had materials about Beria's criminal history. The investigation also determined the facts of some other terrorist assassination activities carried out by the conspirators, whose criminal aim was to eliminate those honest officials who were loyal to the Communist Party and the Soviet regime.

The results of the investigation determined that Beria and his accomplices also carried out some treasonous activities in order to weaken the Soviet Union's defense forces.

The investigation materials prove that the defendants Merkulov, Dekanozov, Kobulov, Goglidze, Meshik, and Vlodzimirsky, due to collusion with Beria, jointly engaged in many years of criminal activities, carried out every criminal instruction of Beria and helped Beria conceal and cover up his criminal history, had committed the above-mentioned many serious crimes of treason.

It has now been determined that the defendants Beria, Merkulov, Dekanozov, Kobulov, Goglidze, Meshik, and Vlodzimirsky have betrayed the motherland, become agents of international imperialism, and become the deadly enemies of the Soviet people.

The results of the investigation also determined some other crimes committed by Beria, proving that Beria was a person of extreme moral corruption, and also determined the facts about Beria's criminal self-serving activities and abuse of power.

During the investigation, the testimony of many witnesses and conclusive documents revealed the crimes of the defendants. The defendants did not deny the series of extremely serious crimes of treason they committed.

Beria is to be tried for the crimes listed in Article 58, Section 1b, Article 58, Section 8, Article 58, Section 13, and Article 58, Section 11 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, namely, treason, organizing anti-Soviet conspiracies and terrorist activities, and actively opposing the working class and the revolutionary workers' movement as an agent of the intelligence agency of the Musavat counter-revolutionary government during the Civil War. Merkulov, Dekanozov, Kobulov, Goglidze, Meshik, and Vlodzimirsky are to be tried for the crimes listed in Article 58, Section 1b, Article 58, Section 8, and Article 58, Section 11 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, namely, treason, carrying out terrorist activities, and participating in the counter-revolutionary group of treasonous conspirators. According to the resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the cases of Beria, Merkulov, Dekanozov, Kobulov, Goglidze, Meshik, and Vlodzimirsky will be heard by a special tribunal organized by the Supreme Court of the USSR in accordance with the law enacted on December 1, 1934.

    关于贝利亚叛国案件
    苏联最高检察署侦讯完毕
    苏联最高法院组织特别法庭审理这个案件
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十七日电：一九五三年六月二十六日，苏联最高苏维埃主席团在审议了苏联部长会议关于外国资本代理人拉·巴·贝利亚的旨在破坏苏维埃国家的罪恶活动的报告后，决定撤销拉·巴·贝利亚所任苏联部长会议第一副主席职务和苏联内务部部长职务，并将他的案件提交法院审理。苏联最高苏维埃于一九五三年八月八日批准了苏联最高苏维埃主席团六月二十六日的决议。
    现在，苏联最高检察署已完成了祖国叛徒拉·巴·贝利亚案件的侦讯工作。
    经侦讯确定：贝利亚利用他的地位，组织了一个和苏维埃国家为敌的阴谋分子的叛国集团，这个集团的罪恶目的是为了外国资本的利益，利用苏联内务部的中央机构和地方机构来反对共产党和苏联政府，他们阴险地企图把内务部放在党和政府之上，以便夺取权力并瓦解工农苏维埃制度，达到使资本主义复辟并恢复资产阶级的统治的目的。多年来，与贝利亚在内务人民委员部、后来又在内务部共同进行罪恶活动的下列被告是这个阴谋分子叛国集团的积极参加者：前苏联国家保安部部长、后任苏联国家监察部部长弗·尼·麦尔库洛夫；前苏联内务人民委员部司长、后任格鲁吉亚苏维埃社会主义共和国内务部部长弗·格·德卡诺佐夫；前格鲁吉亚苏维埃社会主义共和国副内务人民委员、前苏联国家保安部副部长、后任苏联内务部副部长布·兹·柯布洛夫；前格鲁吉亚苏维埃社会主义共和国内务人民委员、后任苏联内务部司长斯·阿·戈格利泽；前苏联内务人民委员部司长、后任乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国内务部部长帕·伊·麦希克；前苏联内务部特别重要案件侦讯司司长拉·叶·弗洛齐米尔斯基。
  多年来，贝利亚和他的同谋者周密地伪装并掩饰他们的敌对叛国活动。约·维·斯大林逝世后，反动帝国主义势力加紧了他们的颠覆苏维埃国家的活动，于是，贝利亚开始加紧他的活动，以达到自己的罪恶目的，他首先利用内务部的机构来夺取权力，这样就使这个祖国叛徒的真面目很快地被揭露，使党和政府能够采取坚决的措施来清算他的敌对活动。
      一九五三年三月，贝利亚担任苏联内务部部长后，就竭尽一切力量，把他的阴谋集团的成员安插在内务部的领导职位上。这些阴谋分子排挤并迫害内务部中拒绝执行贝利亚的罪恶指示的正直工作人员。
    为了破坏集体农庄制度和制造我国粮食供应方面的困难，贝利亚千方百计地破坏和阻挠党和政府所制订的、旨在发展集体农庄和国营农场的经济、不断增进苏联人民福利的最重要的决议的执行。现已确定，贝利亚和他的同谋者采取罪恶的措施，企图使各加盟共和国的资产阶级民族主义分子的残余复辟，制造苏联各族人民之间的敌视和仇恨，首先是破坏苏联各族人民和伟大的俄罗斯人民的友谊。
    贝利亚和他的同谋者既然在国内没有任何社会基础，便把他们的罪恶希望寄托在外国反动帝国主义势力的支持上。
    经侦讯确定：还在国内战争时期，贝利亚就第一次跟外国情报机关有了勾结。一九一九年，贝利亚在巴库就犯了叛国罪行：他在英国间谍机关控制的阿塞拜疆的穆沙瓦特反革命政府的情报机关中作了特务。一九二○年，贝利亚在格鲁吉亚第二次犯了叛国罪行：他跟格鲁吉亚的孟什维克秘密警察建立了秘密联系，而格鲁吉亚孟什维克秘密警察是英国情报机关的一个分支。
    经侦讯确定：在以后的年代中，贝利亚继续通过外国情报机关的间谍，维持并扩大他与这些外国情报机关的秘密的罪恶联系，他曾多次设法使这些间谍不被破获和不受应得的惩罚。
    祖国的叛徒和卖身给外国情报机关的间谍贝利亚，在他整个罪恶活动中，在他的同谋者的帮助下，还跟反革命的格鲁吉亚孟什维克流亡分子以及一些外国情报机关的间谍维持着秘密的联系。
    贝利亚周密地隐瞒和掩饰他的罪恶历史和跟外国情报机关的叛国的勾结，他使用的主要手段就是用诬告、暗算和各种陷害办法来对付那些妨害他反苏维埃国家的罪恶阴谋和妨碍他夺取权力的忠诚的党和苏维埃机关的工作者。
    贝利亚和他的同谋者用这些罪恶的手段窃取了外高加索和格鲁吉亚的重要职位，后来又窃取了苏联内务部的重要职位，并策划夺取权力的叛国阴谋；他们为了排挤不合他们心意的人，不惜采取专横非法的行动，卑鄙地欺骗了党和国家。
    侦讯也揭发了贝利亚为了达到他的野心家的目的和使他这个敌人的真面目不致被揭露而进行的一连串的罪恶阴谋。例如，经侦讯确定：为了达到他的罪恶目的，贝利亚在他的同谋者的帮助下，策划并进行了多年的罪恶阴谋活动，来反对共产党和苏维埃国家的出色活动家谢·奥尔忠尼启则，他认为谢·奥尔忠尼启则是使他不能进一步推进和实现其敌对阴谋的障碍。现已确定：谢·奥尔忠尼启则曾经怀疑过贝利亚的政治面貌。谢·奥尔忠尼启则逝世后，这些阴谋家们继续向他的家属施行残酷的报复。
    侦讯结果并确定了阴谋分子害怕被揭露而进行暗杀活动的事实。例如，贝利亚和他的同谋者杀害了麦·斯·凯德罗夫——一九零二年加入共产党，曾任菲·艾·捷尔任斯基所领导的全俄肃反委员会主席团的委员和国家统一政治保卫局局务委员会委员。阴谋分子之所以要杀害凯德罗夫，是因为怀疑他掌握了关于贝利亚的罪恶历史的材料。侦讯同时还确定了阴谋者所进行的另外一些恐怖暗杀活动的事实，他们进行这些暗杀的罪恶目的在于排除那些忠实于共产党和苏维埃政权的正直的工作人员。
    侦讯结果确定，贝利亚和他的同谋者为了削弱苏联的国防力量，还进行了一些叛国活动。
      侦讯材料证明，被告麦尔库洛夫、德卡诺佐夫、柯布洛夫、戈格利泽、麦希克、弗洛齐米尔斯基，由于和贝利亚勾结，共同从事了多年的罪恶活动，执行贝利亚的每一个罪恶指示并帮助贝利亚隐瞒和掩饰他的罪恶的历史，曾犯了上述这许多严重的叛国罪行。
    现已确定，被告贝利亚、麦尔库洛夫、德卡诺佐夫、柯布洛夫、戈格利泽、麦希克、弗洛齐米尔斯基已经背叛了祖国，成了国际帝国主义的代理人，成了苏联人民的死敌。
    侦讯结果同时确定了贝利亚所犯的另外一些罪行，证明贝利亚是道德上极其堕落的人，此外还确定了关于贝利亚进行罪恶的自私自利的活动和滥用职权的事实。
    侦讯过程中，许多证人的证词和确凿的文件揭露了被告的罪行之后，被告对所犯一连串的极其严重的叛国罪行均供认不讳。
  贝利亚以叛国罪、组织反苏阴谋和恐怖活动罪、以他在内战时期充当穆沙瓦特反革命政府情报机关特务积极反对工人阶级和革命工人运动罪，即俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国刑法第五十八条一款乙项、第五十八条八款、第五十八条十三款、第五十八条十一款所列罪行，被提交审判。麦尔库洛夫、德卡诺佐夫、柯布洛夫、戈格利泽、麦希克和弗洛齐米尔斯基以叛国罪、进行恐怖活动罪、参加叛国阴谋分子反革命集团罪，即俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国刑法第五十八条一款乙项、第五十八条八款、第五十八条十一款所列罪行，被提交审判。根据苏联最高苏维埃主席团的决议，贝利亚、麦尔库洛夫、德卡诺佐夫、柯布洛夫、戈格利泽、麦希克和弗洛齐米尔斯基的案件，将由苏联最高法院根据一九三四年十二月一日所制订的法律，组织特别法庭审理。
