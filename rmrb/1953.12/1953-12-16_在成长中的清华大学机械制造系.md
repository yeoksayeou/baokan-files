    The Growing Department of Mechanical Manufacturing at Tsinghua University
    Li Minfan
    After the restructuring of colleges and departments last summer, several departments that did not previously exist appeared at Tsinghua University, and the Department of Mechanical Manufacturing was one of them. In old China, there was no mechanical manufacturing industry to speak of, and naturally, there was no Department of Mechanical Manufacturing in higher education institutions. After liberation, the motherland needed to establish its own mechanical manufacturing industry. Therefore, training a large number of mechanical manufacturing talents became one of the basic tasks of higher industrial schools. Thus, we separated from the original Department of Mechanical Engineering and established the Department of Mechanical Manufacturing (the Department of Power Machinery was also established at the same time).
    At that time, among the 60 teachers in the entire department, there were only eight professors, and the rest were all teaching assistants who had just graduated from university, most of whom lacked practical experience.
    In the past, teachers' manufacturing courses focused on metal cutting processing, with little study of foundry and pressure processing. However, the mechanical manufacturing industry cannot function with cutting processing alone; it must have casting and pressure processing. Therefore, in the first academic year after the teaching reform, based on the principles of possibility and need, four specialties were established: Mechanical Manufacturing Engineering, Metal Cutting Machine Tools, Foundry Engineering, and Pressure Processing, along with two specialized courses (Metalworking and Foundry). This semester, a welding specialty was also added.
    Under the education of the Party, the teachers of the Department of Mechanical Manufacturing understood from practice that everything had to be learned from scratch, honestly and humbly, from the Soviet Union.
    At the beginning, all teachers in the school studied Soviet teaching plans and teaching syllabi. In the process of transitioning from the elective system of Anglo-American capitalist countries to the planned teaching of socialist Soviet Union, teachers did not immediately appreciate the superiority of the Soviet teaching system. Although some teachers had taught for more than ten years, none had seriously considered what the training objectives for students were and how to cultivate engineers. There was a traditional view that students mainly learned some basic knowledge in university and became trainee technicians after graduation; it was impossible to cultivate them in school into creative engineers capable of solving problems in production. This idea seriously affected the work. Therefore, when they heard that Soviet higher education institutions could train engineers capable of shouldering production responsibilities in five years, teachers felt immense interest on the one hand, and some doubts on the other. After carefully studying the Soviet teaching plans and tentatively drafting teaching plans suitable for the current situation based on the Soviet five-year teaching plans, they gained a certain understanding of the superiority of the Soviet teaching system. The meticulousness and rigor of the Soviet teaching plans, the clarity of objectives, and the close integration of theory and practice convinced everyone that the Soviet Union could train engineers in five years.
    However, due to a lack of experience and some old teaching concepts in their minds, many teachers could not deeply grasp the spirit of the Soviet teaching plans. For example, in order to compress the five-year teaching plan into four years, the method of "averaging an 80% reduction" was used to solve the problem of excessive time in the teaching plan. Some advocated canceling graduation theses, believing that there were no conditions to do them; they also could not explain why chemistry should be studied, why atomic nucleus physics should be taught in physics, or what the course on process automation was about.
    After studying the Soviet teaching syllabi, the teachers deeply felt that its content was rich and had a rigorous scientific system. However, the teachers had just crammed Russian and could not smoothly read Russian professional books. Therefore, the question was raised: what to do? Should they still use old textbooks or try to use new textbooks as much as possible? We knew that the former was a familiar path, which was much easier and more convenient; the latter was an unfamiliar path, which required many hardships and difficulties, but it was a path leading to a broad road. The teachers resolutely chose the latter: learning from the Soviet Union. Everyone understood that after clarifying the training objectives of each specialty, the issue of selecting teaching materials became even more important. Without new teaching materials, teachers could not teach students. Professor Wang Zunming, who had a relatively high level of Russian, translated 400,000 words of teaching materials in nearly half a year. The entire department organized a group of people to translate the metal cutting machine tool section in metalworking. A small number of teachers who had not learned Russian organized themselves to cram Russian. By the end of the last semester, they could generally read two pages of books (in their professional fields) in one hour.
    Teachers had to learn almost every course from scratch. To prepare for a class, they had to not only look up Russian vocabulary and study grammar but also consider teaching methods. Even experienced teachers made thorough preparations before class. The teachers all understood that facing students was a concrete manifestation of responsibility to the people. Professor Wang Zunming taught two courses in the first semester, using all Soviet textbooks. Before lecturing, he always carefully memorized the materials, such as the annual output of a certain material and its properties. However, he did not have a sufficient understanding of the students' acceptance abilities and ideological situation. Therefore, lecturing became a process of individual labor for the teacher, and the students were in a position of being instilled with knowledge, so the effect was not very good at the beginning. Professor Wang Zunming gradually learned from lecturing that learning is a process of students consciously mastering knowledge, and the key to giving good lectures lies in enabling students to actively engage in independent thinking. He improved his method of preparing lessons and significantly improved the teaching effect. Lecturer Chen Nanping learned Professor Wang Zunming's teaching method, first mastering the content of the teaching materials, and then preparing lessons based on the specific circumstances of the students, thereby improving the teaching effect.
    Delving into teaching methods has become a daily task for every teacher. To make the requirements for mechanical drawing clearer, the engineering drawing teaching and research group sent teachers to the Beijing Machine Factory to learn about the factory's requirements; they took drawings to consult with workers, asking them if they could understand them and what problems there were in processing; or they asked Soviet experts to review them. The teachers teaching the Machine Parts and Tolerances courses formed a lesson preparation group in the second semester. Before lecturing, the teachers involved studied together how to select teaching materials and how to explain them; teachers often attended each other's classes. This semester, lesson preparation groups have been universally established throughout the department. We know that when the level of teachers has improved, this kind of organization is inappropriate. But under the current situation where the level of teachers is relatively low, this method can be used to exchange experiences and more deeply understand Soviet teaching materials. Soviet experts have pointed out to us that the work of the lesson preparation groups can be transferred to scientific research in the future.
    Cultivating new forces is the central task of the entire department. The leadership, according to the plan, first assigned tasks to the teachers, requiring them to offer new courses at appropriate times, and arranging certain conditions for them. For example, a certain amount of time is reserved each semester for new teachers to formulate plans according to their tasks, ensuring that new courses are offered on schedule. In the first semester, the Metal Cutting Teaching and Research Group assigned the Tool course to young lecturer Zhong Shoumin for preparation. After studying the Soviet Tool course outline, Zhong Shoumin drafted a lecture outline; Professor Jin Xiwu, the director of the teaching and research group, also helped him solve certain difficult problems in terms of teaching materials. Before the end of the first semester, Zhong Shoumin compiled four weeks of teaching materials. With the help of the teachers, he finally offered this course as scheduled in the second semester. Because Zhong Shoumin could humbly learn and with the enthusiastic help of the old professors, the teaching effect was good. Under the help and supervision of the teaching and research group, there are many other teachers who have formulated plans to prepare new courses. For example, this year's Mechanical Manufacturing Engineering course is taught by a teaching assistant who just graduated last year. Under the cultivation of Soviet experts, it is expected that many teachers will offer new courses in one and a half to two years.
    Professors directly leading young teachers' lectures is also a way to cultivate teachers. Given the ideological level and professional foundation of young teachers today, if professors can provide assistance and guidance in terms of teaching materials, assist in lesson preparation, and actively care about their work, constantly encouraging them, some of the difficulties in teaching are not insurmountable.
    Over the past year, with the active efforts of the teachers, we have made some achievements in teaching reform and have also gained some experience in learning from the Soviet Union. These achievements cannot but be attributed to the leadership of the Party and the government and the help of Soviet experts. (Attached picture)

    在成长中的清华大学机械制造系
    李民范
    去年暑期院系调整之后，清华大学出现了几个以前没有的系，机械制造系就是其中之一。在旧中国，是没有什么机械制造业的，高等学校里当然也就谈不上什么机械制造系了。解放后，祖国需要建立自己的机械制造业，因此，培养大批机械制造人材，便成为高等工业学校的基本任务之一。于是，我们从原来的机械系里分出来，成立了机械制造系（同时分出成立的还有动力机械系）。
    当时，在全系六十个教师中，只有八位教授，其他都是刚从大学毕业的助教，他们多缺乏实际经验。
    教师们过去学的制造课程偏重金属切削加工方面，很少学铸工和压力加工。可是机械制造业只有切削加工是不成的，必须有铸造和压力加工。因此在教学改革后的第一学年，根据可能与需要的原则，成立了四个专业：机械制造工程、金属切削机床、铸造工程、压力加工，和两个专修科（金工和铸工）。这学期又增设了焊接专业。
    机械制造系的教师们在党的教育下，从实践中懂得：一切都得从头学起，老老实实地虚心地学习苏联。
    一开头，全校教师学习苏联教学计划、教学大纲。在从英美资本主义国家的选课制度转变到社会主义苏联的计划教学的过程中，教师们并不是一下就体会到苏联教学制度的优越性的。尽管有些教师教过十几年书，但是谁也没有认真思索过学生的培养目标是什么，怎样才能培养出工程师来。有一种传统的看法：认为学生在大学里主要是学一些基础知识，毕业之后先当见习技术员；他们不可能在学校中就培养成为具有创造性的、能在生产中解决问题的工程师。这种思想严重地影响了工作。因此，当听到苏联高等学校在五年内培养出能够担负生产责任的工程师时，教师们一方面感到莫大的兴趣，另方面又有着某些怀疑。经过大家细心研究了苏联教学计划，并根据苏联五年的教学计划试拟了适合于当前情况的教学计划以后，才对苏联教学制度的优越性有了一定的认识。苏联教学计划的周密、严格，目的性的明确，以及理论和实践的密切结合，使大家信服了苏联在五年中是可以培养出工程师来的。
    但由于缺乏经验以及思想上有某些旧的教学观点，许多教师不能深刻领会苏联教学计划的精神。譬如，为了把五年教学计划压缩成四年，曾用“平均打八折”的办法来解决教学计划中时间过多的问题。有的主张取消毕业论文，认为没有条件做；也说不出为什么要学化学，为什么物理中要讲原子核物理；不知道工序自动化这门课到底是什么内容。
    学习了苏联教学大纲之后，教师们深深感到，它的内容是丰富的，又有严密的科学系统性。但是，教师们刚刚突击学习了俄文，不能顺畅地阅读俄文专业书籍。因此，问题就提出来了：怎么办？仍旧采用旧教材还是尽量改用新教材？我们知道：前一条是熟路，省力得多，便当得很；后一条是生路，走这条路须经许多艰难困苦，但却是一条引向康庄大道的路。教师们坚决选择了后者：学习苏联。大家懂得，在每个专业的培养目的明确之后，选择教材的问题更显得重要了，如果没有新教材，教师就不能教学生。俄文水平比较高的王遵明教授就在将近半年的时间中译出了四十万字的教材。全系组织了一批人力，翻译金属工学中的金属切削机床部分。少数没有学过俄文的教师，组织起来突击学习俄文。到上学期末，一般都能在一小时内阅读两页书（专业方面的）。
    教师们几乎对每门课程都要从头学习。为了准备一堂课，不仅要查俄文生字，研究文法，还要考虑教学方法。即使是有经验的教师，上课前也作了充分的准备。教师们都了解，面向学生乃是对人民负责的具体表现。王遵明教授第一个学期担任两门课，全部采用苏联教材。讲课以前他总要仔细地默记教材，例如，某种材料的年产量多少，性能如何。然而，他对于学生的接受能力、思想情况都了解得不够。因此，讲课成为教师单独劳动的过程，学生处于被灌输的地位，所以刚开始时效果并不好。王遵明教授逐渐从讲课中了解到学习是学生自觉掌握知识的过程，讲好课的关键在于使学生能积极地进行独立思考。他改进了备课的方法，显著地提高了教学效果。讲师陈南平学习了王遵明教授的教学法，先掌握教材的内容，然后根据学生的具体情况准备课，因而提高了教学效果。
    钻研教学方法，已成为每个教师的日常工作。为使机械制图的要求更为明确，工程画教研组曾派教师到北京机器厂去学习，了解工厂的要求；拿了图请教工人，问他们能不能看懂，加工上有什么问题；或者请苏联专家评阅。讲机器零件和公差两课的教师，在第二学期成立了备课小组。讲课之前，有关教师一起研究如何选用教材，如何进行讲解；教师与教师之间时常互相听课。本学期全系普遍地成立了备课小组。我们知道，当教师的水平提高之后，这种组织是不适当的。但在目前教师水平较低的情况下，可以采用这种方式，交流经验，更深入地理解苏联教材。苏联专家曾经给我们指出，备课小组的工作将来可转到科学研究方面去。
    培养新的力量是全系的中心工作。领导方面按照计划，首先把任务分配给教员，要求他们在适当时期开出新的课来，并为他们安排一定的条件。例如，每学期保留一定的时间，由新教师根据任务订出计划来，保证按期开出新课。第一学期金属切削教研组把刀具这门课分配给青年讲师钟寿民准备。钟寿民学习了苏联的刀具课提纲之后，就拟写了讲课提纲；教研组主任金希武教授又在教材方面帮他解决某些困难问题。第一学期结束之前，钟寿民编写了四个星期的教材，他在教师们的帮助下终于如期地在第二学期开了这门课。由于钟寿民能虚心学习，加上老教授的热心帮助，教学效果是良好的。在教研组的帮助、督促之下，订出计划准备新课的还有许多教员。例如，今年开机械制造工学课的就有去年刚毕业的助教。在苏联专家的培养下，预计在一年半到两年的时间内将有不少教师开新课。
    教授直接领导年轻教师讲课，也是一种培养师资的方式。以今天年轻教师的思想水平和业务基础来说，如果教授能在教材方面给以帮助和指导，备课上给以协助，并主动地关心他们的工作，经常鼓舞他们，教学中的某些困难不是不能克服的。
    一年来，在教师们的积极努力下，我们在教学改革方面取得了一些成绩，在学习苏联经验方面也已经有了一些收获。这些成绩的取得，不能不归功于党和政府的领导和苏联专家的帮助。（附图片）
