    National Model Agricultural Laborer Lü Hongbin
    Writes to Chairman Mao, Expressing Firm Support for the General Line of the State
    And Sells One Thousand Jin of Surplus Grain to the State to Support National Construction
    After hearing the publicity about the general line and general task of the state during the transition period, Lü Hongbin, a national model agricultural laborer, wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, expressing his firm support for the general line and general task, leading the surrounding peasants to take the socialist road to common prosperity, and decided to sell one thousand jin of surplus grain to the state to support national construction. His letter said:
    Respected Chairman Mao: After hearing the publicity about the general line and general task of the state during the transition period, I know that our country is transitioning to a socialist society, and I am truly happy from the bottom of my heart. Because what you say is absolutely true, and it is all for the people to live a happy life. Not to mention the distant past, let's just take the recent years. You called on the peasants to organize, develop production, and take the socialist road. I listened to you and led the peasants from mutual aid teams to agricultural production cooperatives. As a result, production has greatly increased, the actual income of cooperative members has increased, and their lives have gradually improved. Now you have clearly told us the general line and general task of the state during the transition period. We are transitioning to socialism, and a happy socialist society is getting closer and closer to us. How can we not be happy!
    Chairman Mao! Our agricultural production cooperative firmly responds to your wise call, and we must further create conditions to transition to cooperatives with a completely socialist nature. At the same time, we must actively increase grain production to support the state's development of industry. Only when industry is developed can we build a strong national defense force, protect the country's gate, and carry out construction steadily; and only when industry is developed can we manufacture many machines for agriculture, so that agriculture can move towards collectivization and mechanization. The day before yesterday, I held a family meeting, and the whole family was willing to sell one thousand jin of surplus grain to the state to support national construction.
    Chairman Mao! These days, I have been taking newspapers every day and publicizing the general line and general task of the state during the transition period among the cooperative members. The cooperative members were very happy after hearing the publicity. Because the enthusiasm of the cooperative members is high, their enthusiasm for production is even greater. Now many cooperative members are preparing to sell surplus grain to the state. All 255 mu of winter cultivated land in the whole cooperative has been plowed, and winter agricultural and sideline production is also being carried out enthusiastically. At present, the whole cooperative is planning to summarize and evaluate the production achievements and experience of the past year, further lay the foundation for agricultural production increase next year, and strive to produce more grain to support national construction and build a new socialist countryside!

    全国农业劳动模范吕鸿宾
    写信给毛主席表示坚决拥护国家总路线
    并把一千斤余粮卖给国家，支援国家建设
    全国农业劳动模范吕鸿宾听到国家过渡时期总路线总任务的宣传后，写信给毛主席，表示坚决拥护总路线总任务，带动周围农民群众走大家富裕的社会主义道路，并决定把一千斤余粮卖给国家，支援国家建设。他的信中说：
    敬爱的毛主席：我听到国家过渡时期总路线总任务的宣传后，知道我们国家正向社会主义社会过渡，我真是从心里欢喜。因为您所说的话都是千真万确的，都是为了人民过幸福的日子。远的不说，就拿最近几年来说吧，您号召农民组织起来，发展生产，走社会主义的道路，我听了您的话，领导农民从互助组发展成为农业生产合作社，因此生产大大地提高了，社员们的实际收入增加了，生活也逐步改善了。现在您又明确地告诉我们国家在过渡时期的总路线总任务，我们正在向社会主义过渡，幸福的社会主义社会离我们是越来越近了，我们哪能不高兴呢！
    毛主席！我们农业生产合作社坚决响应您的英明号召，要进一步地创造条件向完全社会主义性质的合作社过渡。同时我们更要积极增产粮食，支援国家发展工业。只有工业发展了，才能建设起强大的国防力量，保住国家的大门，安稳地进行建设；也只有工业发展了，才能为农业制造出许多机器，使农业走向集体化、机械化。前天我召开了一个家庭会议，全家都乐意将一千斤余粮卖给国家，支援国家的建设。
    毛主席！这些日子我天天拿着报纸，在社员当中宣传国家在过渡时期的总路线总任务。社员们听了宣传后，也都十分高兴。因为社员们的情绪高涨，所以生产劲头更大了，现在许多社员正准备将余粮卖给国家。全社二百五十五亩冬耕地已全部耕完，冬季农副业生产也热烈地开展起来了。目前全社正计划总结评比一年来的生产成绩和经验，进一步打下明年农业增产的基础，为多产粮食支援国家建设，建设社会主义的新农村而奋斗！（附图片）
