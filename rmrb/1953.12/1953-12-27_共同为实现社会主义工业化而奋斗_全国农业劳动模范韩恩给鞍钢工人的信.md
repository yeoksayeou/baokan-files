    Strive Together to Achieve Socialist Industrialization
    ——A Letter from National Model Agricultural Laborer Han En to Anshan Iron and Steel Workers
    Dear Comrades of Anshan Iron and Steel Company:
    Recently, I saw in the newspaper that the seamless steel tube plant and the large rolling mill have been built, and a lot of steel billets and seamless steel tubes have been produced, which made me very happy. I quickly told this news to all our cooperative members, and everyone was overjoyed. The cooperative members said: The more factories we build in the future, the better our lives will be, and then we will soon reach a socialist society. We should first thank our Soviet elder brother for their selfless assistance in building such a good big factory, and we should also thank you – our dear worker elder brothers – for your contributions. Your patriotic spirit of not being afraid of difficulties and actively working inspires us. After learning from the newspaper about the "pillar replacement" incident in the No. 11 factory building of your seamless steel tube plant, the cooperative members were all touched by the heroic actions of workers such as Wang Hongfa and Ma Qingguo, who risked their lives and worked hard in the water overnight to rescue the collapsing foundation pit. Whenever we encounter difficulties in production, we think of you, which gives us more strength. Therefore, although our cooperative suffered natural disasters this year, we still achieved a bumper harvest, with a total of 250,000 jin of grain harvested by the whole cooperative.
    All of us in the cooperative know that to realize national industrialization, we farmers need to work hard to increase production, sell grain to the state, provide enough for you to eat and use, and support you in producing more good machines; only in this way can our agricultural production be mechanized. Therefore, all of our cooperative members unanimously agreed to sell all the surplus grain to the state. Now all of our cooperative members are actively engaged in winter production, preparing to expand agricultural production next year, and it is estimated that we will earn 30 million yuan by the end of the year. With these 30 million yuan, plus the money from selling grain, in addition to what we need for production and living next year, all our cooperative members have decided to purchase the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds. Next year, we also plan to double the size of the cooperative, open 20 hectares of paddy fields, improve agricultural technology, and increase grain production, so as to supply your needs.
    I hope you will earnestly learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, continuously improve your technology, and build our motherland into a more prosperous and strong country. Although our work posts are different, we have only one goal. Let us join hands and work together under the shining light of the general line to strive for the early realization of socialist industrialization.
    I wish you good health!
    National Model Agricultural Laborer
    Han En, Director of the Han En Agricultural Production Cooperative, Jiaohe County

    共同为实现社会主义工业化而奋斗
    ——全国农业劳动模范韩恩给鞍钢工人的信亲爱的鞍山钢铁公司全体工人同志们：
    最近，我从报纸上看到了无缝钢管厂和大型轧钢厂建设好了，已经生产出很多钢坯和无缝钢管，这可使我太高兴啦。我很快地就把这个消息告诉了我们全体社员，把大伙都乐坏了。社员们都说：咱们今后建设的工厂越多，咱们的日子就过得越好，那就快到社会主义社会啦。咱们能建设成这么好的大工厂，先应当感谢苏联老大哥对咱们无私的援助，也更得感谢你们——亲爱的工人老大哥的功劳。你们那种不怕困难、积极劳动的爱国主义精神鼓舞着我们。在报上知道了你们在修建无缝钢管厂的十一号厂房“托柱换基”的事情后，社员们都被王洪法、马庆国等工人同志们不顾生命危险、在水里紧张工作一宿、抢救了要塌陷的基础大坑的英雄行为所感动了。我们在生产中一遇到困难，一想起你们，就给我们增加了力量。因此，我们社今年虽遭受了自然灾害，可是还获得了大丰收，全社共打了二十五万斤粮食。
    我们社员都知道，要实现国家工业化，就需要我们农民努力增产，把粮食卖给国家，供足你们吃的、用的，支援你们生产出更多的好机器；只有这样，我们农业生产才能机械化。所以我们全体社员一致同意把全部余粮卖给了国家。现在我们全体社员正积极搞冬季生产，准备扩大明年的农业生产，估计到年底能收入三千万元。这三千万元，再加上卖粮食的钱，除了来年生产和生活用的以外，我们全体社员决定要购买一九五四年国家经济建设公债。明年我们还准备把合作社扩大一倍，开二十垧水田，改进农业技术，多增产粮食，好来供应你们的需要。
    我希望你们认真学习苏联的先进经验，不断提高技术，把我们的祖国建设得更富强。咱们的工作岗位虽然不同，但是目标只有一个，让我们携起手来，在总路线的光辉照耀下大家一齐努力，为早日实现社会主义工业化而奋斗。
    祝你们身体健康！
    全国农业劳动模范
    蛟河县韩恩农业生产合作社主任  韩恩
