    Guangliang Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Yanji County, Jilin Province
    Does a Good Job in "Storing Production Funds"
　　After the credit department of the Guangliang Village Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Yanji County, Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region, Jilin Province, developed the business of "storing production funds" and "ordering production materials on behalf of farmers," the credit department has become an assistant in improving agricultural production in the village.
　　The credit department of the cooperative started handling the "storing production funds" business in October last year. When opening this business, special attention was paid to making it convenient for farmers to deposit and withdraw money, and to "ordering production materials on behalf of farmers." After this method was implemented, it was supported by many farmers. More than 80% of the farmers in the village have stored production funds. By the end of June this year, the production funds stored by the credit department had reached more than 100 million yuan.
　　The deposits in the credit department helped depositors increase their production investment. Under this circumstance, Guangliang Village applied an average of 510 jin of fertilizer per hectare (15 mu) this year, an increase of 59% over last year. Although the village suffered frost damage this year, due to the large amount of fertilizer applied and the rapid growth of crops, the yield was still no less than the bumper harvest of last year. At the same time, farmers in the village who had more difficulties in production and life also received assistance from the credit department. Recently, after the farmers sold their surplus grain, the amount of deposits increased again. (Xinhua News Agency)

    吉林延吉县光亮村供销社
    “储存生产资金”业务办得好
　　吉林省延边朝鲜族自治区延吉县光亮村供销合作社信用部发展“储存生产资金”和“代订生产资料”业务后，信用部已成为提高该村农业生产的助手。
　　该社信用部办理“储存生产资金”业务是从去年十月开始的。在开办这个业务时，特别注意给农民存钱取钱的方便，并为农民“代订生产资料”。这办法实行后受到许多农民的拥护，全村有百分之八十以上的农户储存了生产资金。到今年六月底，信用部所储存的生产资金已达一亿多元。　　信用部的存款帮助储存者增加了生产投资。在这种情况下，光亮村今年每垧（十五市亩）地普遍施肥五百一十斤，平均比去年增加施肥量百分之五十九。虽然今年该村遭受了霜灾，但因施肥多，庄稼成长的快，产量仍不比去年丰收的数量少。同时，村中生产和生活较困难的农户，也得到了信用部的帮助。最近，农民卖出余粮后，存款的数量又有增加。　（新华社）
