Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 1st. Our special correspondent Jiang Nan reports: The comprehensive proposal put forward by the Korean-Chinese side on November 30 regarding the five items on the agenda of the bilateral talks has cleared the way for a swift convocation of a political conference. Whether the political conference can be held in New Delhi on December 28 now depends entirely on the U.S. side.

    The efforts made by the Korean-Chinese side to convene a political conference quickly have been so enormous and obvious that even Great Britain, which sent troops to participate in the Korean War on the side of the US, cannot deny it. According to Agence France-Presse, officials in London believe that the Korean-Chinese proposal "is an important step towards reaching an agreement on a preliminary meeting." Even the United States' United Press, which has consistently supported Dean's delaying tactics, admits that the Korean-Chinese proposal is "the biggest step towards convening a political conference" and "will be highly valued by the governments of those countries that have fought alongside UN forces against the Communists in Korea." However, judging from many signs, U.S. representative Dean will continue to engage in unreasonable obstruction and delays, causing the political conference to be postponed indefinitely.

    At the meeting on November 30, Dean adopted an extremely frivolous attitude towards the important proposal of the Korean-Chinese side. Without thinking, he said that the important proposal of the Korean-Chinese side was "a joke." He also told American reporters outside the meeting that the talks had "made no progress at all," leaving him "very disappointed." However, during the twelve days in which he delayed the discussion of substantive issues in the bilateral talks, Dean repeatedly spread an "optimistic" atmosphere outside the meeting, claiming to American reporters that the talks had even made "considerable progress." Dean's attitude is clearly not that of someone who is honest and willing to negotiate sincerely.

    According to United Press reporter Kendrick, Dean once declared on November 30 that "the United Nations might accept New Delhi as the meeting place." However, later that day, a spokesman for the US delegation quickly came out to say, "This news is incorrect," and "please be sure to correct it." At the same time, Lee Syngman's Foreign Minister Byun Young-tae clamored that Lee Syngman "will never agree" to hold the meeting in New Delhi. This clearly shows that although the Korean-Chinese side has made reasonable concessions and proposed New Delhi as the meeting place, and Dean has admitted that this is acceptable, he may still continue to employ delaying tactics on this issue.

    Signs indicate that Dean will continue to use the method of slandering the Soviet Union as not being a neutral nation to delay the process. Because the Korean-Chinese side, in accordance with the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement, pointed out that neutral nations refer to "countries that have not had combat troops participate in hostile actions in Korea," Dean was left speechless and had no reason to refuse to recognize the Soviet Union as a neutral nation. However, after the Korean-Chinese proposal was put forward, Dean still attempted to play tricks on this issue. A spokesman for the US delegation declared on November 30 that the United States would demand that the Soviet Union participate in the meeting not as a neutral nation or a belligerent nation, but as a so-called "third party" with voting rights and bound by all agreements. The absurdity of this demand from the US side is obvious. On the one hand, the US side agrees that the political conference should take the form of an equal meeting between the two parties to the Armistice Agreement, with only the two parties having the right to vote at the meeting. On the other hand, it wants the neutral Soviet Union to have the right to vote and be bound by all agreements. On the one hand, it dares not insist that the Soviet Union is a belligerent nation, but on the other hand, it attempts to refuse to recognize the Soviet Union as a neutral nation, and innovatively concocts a so-called "third party" title to place on the Soviet Union, actually attempting to exclude the Soviet Union, the most important neutral nation in Asia, from the political conference. In international law, there has never been a "third party" provision other than "belligerent nation" and "neutral nation." What exactly is this third party? According to what Dean said at the meeting, he did not say what "third party" the Soviet Union was. On the contrary, he said that whether the Soviet Union approves or disapproves of a proposal through voting or verbally, it will be counted as our side approving or opposing the proposal. This is clearly still trying to forcibly assign the Soviet Union as a party in the Korean War. The Korean-Chinese side will resolutely not allow this.

    In the past five-plus weeks, Dean has been implementing Washington's pre-determined timetable for delaying bilateral talks, attempting to drag the talks past the US's so-called deadline for explaining the non-direct repatriation of prisoners of war, in order to prevent the United Nations General Assembly from discussing the Korean issue and to achieve its sinister goal of forcibly detaining prisoners of war. The comprehensive proposal of the Korean-Chinese side has already eliminated any excuse for Dean to delay the process. When the bilateral representatives' meeting resumes on December 2, people can clearly see from Dean's attitude towards the Korean-Chinese proposal whether the US side wants to resolve the issue with sincerity.

### 我方的全面建议为召开政治会议铺平道路  政治会议能否迅速召开全看美方有无诚意

    我方的全面建议为召开政治会议铺平道路
    政治会议能否迅速召开全看美方有无诚意
    【新华社开城一日电】本社特派记者江南报道：朝中方面在十一月三十日就双方会谈的五项议程提出的全面建议，已经为迅速召开政治会议扫清了道路。政治会议能否在十二月二十八日在新德里召开，现在完全要看美方了。
    朝中方面为了迅速召开政治会议所作的努力是如此巨大而且明显，就是出兵参加朝鲜战争的美方的英国也不能不承认。据法新社报道，伦敦的官方人士认为朝中方面的建议“是走向预备会议取得协议的重要的一步”。甚至一向为迪安的拖延策略捧场的美国的合众社，也承认朝中方面的建议是“向召开政治会议方面迈进的最大一步”，“将受到在朝鲜和共军打过仗的那些国家的政府的极大的重视”。但是从许多迹象看来，美国代表迪安仍将继续进行无理的阻挠和拖延，使政治会议仍然迟迟不能召开。
    在十一月三十日的会议上，迪安对于朝中方面的重要建议采取了极不郑重的态度。他不加思索地就说朝中方面的重要建议是“开玩笑”。他在会外又对美国记者说，会谈“完全没有进展”，使他
  “非常失望”。但是在他拖延双方会谈的实质问题讨论的十二天中，迪安反而一再在会外散布“乐观”的空气，对美国记者声称会谈甚至有“相当大的进展”。迪安的这种态度显然不是老老实实的和愿意诚意协商的态度。
    据合众社记者肯德里克报道，迪安曾经在十一月三十日宣称，“联合国也许会接受新德里作为会议地点。”但是当天深晚，美方代表团的一位发言人就赶紧出来说，“这个消息是不正确的”，“请你们一定要加以更正”。同时，李承晚的外务部长官卞荣泰就叫嚷说，李承晚“永远不能同意”在新德里举行会议。这清楚地说明，虽然朝中方面已经作了合理的让步，提议以新德里作为会议地点，迪安也承认这是可以接受的，但他仍然可能在这个问题上继续施展拖延策略。
    迹象表明：迪安还将继续用诬蔑苏联不是中立国的办法来进行拖延。由于朝中方面根据朝鲜停战协定的规定，指出中立国是指“未有战斗部队参加在朝鲜的敌对行为的国家”，使迪安理屈词穷，再也没有任何理由来拒绝承认苏联是中立国。但是在朝中方面的建议提出以后，迪安仍然企图在这个问题上玩弄花样。美国代表团的一个发言人在十一月三十日宣称，美国将要求苏联不是以中立国或交战国的身份参加会议，而以具有投票权并受一切协议的约束的所谓“第三者”的身份参加会议。美方这种要求的荒谬可笑是很明显的。美方一方面同意政治会议应采取停战协定缔约双方对等会议的形式，在会议上只有双方有表决权，一方面却要中立国的苏联有投票权，并且要苏联受一切协议的约束；一方面不敢硬说苏联是交战国，一方面却企图拒绝承认苏联是中立国，而别出心裁地捏造出一个什么
  “第三者”的衔头来加在苏联头上，实际上是企图将亚洲最重要的中立国苏联排除在政治会议之外。国际公法上除了“交战国”和“中立国”以外，从来没有什么“第三者”的规定。这个第三者究竟是什么呢？照迪安在会议上所说，他并没讲苏联是什么“第三者”。正相反，他说苏联无论是经过投票或者口头对提案表示赞成或不赞成，都要算是我方赞成或者反对这个提案。这显然还是想把苏联硬派为朝鲜交战中的一方。朝中方面坚决不能容许这样。
    在过去五个多星期中，迪安一直执行着华盛顿所预先规定的拖延双方会谈的时间表，企图将会谈拖过美方所谓对不直接遣返战俘的解释期限，以便阻止联合国大会讨论朝鲜问题，并达到其强迫扣留战俘的罪恶目的。朝中方面的全面建议已经解除了迪安进行拖延的任何藉口。当双方代表会议在十二月二日复会的时候，人们从迪安对于朝中方面的建议的态度，就可以清楚地看出美方是否想拿诚意来解决问题。
