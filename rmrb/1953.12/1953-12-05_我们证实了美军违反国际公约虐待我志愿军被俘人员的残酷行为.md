    We have confirmed the cruel acts of the U.S. military in violating international conventions and mistreating captured personnel of our Volunteer Army
    Professor of Internal Medicine Zhong Huilan
    I participated in the health investigation and assessment of our wounded and sick returnees repatriated by the U.S. side before the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, and our non-wounded and sick returnees after the signing of the Armistice Agreement. Those who participated in the work were all domestic medical experts and authorities. We conducted our work very strictly, scientifically, realistically, and objectively. After months of careful examination and analysis, we unanimously reached a common conclusion: the U.S. military seriously violated the Geneva Convention of August 12, 1949, regarding the protection of the health and safety of prisoners of war, and inhumanely mistreated captured personnel of our Volunteer Army. This conclusion is based on ironclad and undeniable objective facts, such as: (1) Due to the U.S. military's inhuman mistreatment of prisoners of war, the poor nutrition in the POW camps led to severe and widespread nutritional deficiencies. (2) Due to the U.S. military's inhuman mistreatment of prisoners of war, the conditions in the POW camps were extremely poor, seriously causing the widespread emergence and rapid development of tuberculosis. (3) Due to the U.S. military's inhuman mistreatment of prisoners of war, the poor sanitary conditions caused a large number of severe chronic respiratory diseases. (4) Due to the U.S. military's inhuman mistreatment of prisoners of war, acts of violence and persecution, the prisoners of war suffered severe mental trauma and physical damage.
    Now I will briefly introduce the facts about the U.S. military's mistreatment of prisoners of war in terms of internal medicine:
    I. The nutritional deficiencies of all returnees are significant and widespread. This is manifested in: (A) the universality of sallow complexion and emaciation; (B) the universality of Vitamin A deficiency; (C) the universality of riboflavin (a type of Vitamin B) deficiency; (D) the widespread increase in capillary fragility. The vast majority of returnees had a pale complexion, and their skin was dry and lacked luster. Generally weak and listless, they felt short of breath after slight exercise or climbing stairs, and most appeared older than their actual age.
    1. Widespread weight loss: The diet of the returnees greatly improved after returning to the country, but due to the extreme torture they suffered in the POW camps, their appetite was still very poor, and many people's food intake could only reach half of what it was before capture. Even so, among 1,045 returnees, more than 80 percent had significant weight gain within a short period of 26 days after returning to the country, except for a portion who had nutritional edema, which temporarily reduced their weight after the edema disappeared with improved diet. Most of the increase was more than two or three kilograms. One hundred and twenty-five people gained more than five kilograms. The above situation fully proves that the U.S. military mistreated captured personnel of our Volunteer Army, often giving them nutritionally deficient diets, causing widespread weight loss or edema. There is no other reason to explain this.
    2. The widespread existence of various vitamin deficiencies: (1) The widespread occurrence of Vitamin A deficiency: Among 1,045 non-sick and wounded returnees, we found that 89.9 percent had Vitamin A deficiency, including 546 with night blindness, accounting for 52.2 percent, 659 with follicular keratosis, accounting for 63.1 percent, and 521 with conjunctival pigmentation and Bitot's spots, accounting for 49 percent. Many of them had two or three of the above-mentioned Vitamin A deficiencies at the same time. (2) The existence of riboflavin deficiency is also very common. Among the returnees, 833 (accounting for 79.7 percent) had this symptom. For example, 704 (accounting for 67.4 percent) had angular cheilitis, 96 (accounting for 9.2 percent) had stomatitis, 38 (accounting for 3.6 percent) had glossitis, and 408 (accounting for 39 percent) had scrotal eczema. (3) Regarding Vitamin C deficiency, we examined 407 people without selection and found that 72 of them (accounting for 17.7 percent) had significantly increased capillary fragility, indicating the existence of Vitamin C deficiency.
    3. The widespread existence of anemia: Among the non-sick and wounded returnees, we randomly examined the hemoglobin of 785 people and found that those with hemoglobin below 20 grams accounted for 84 percent, and those with hemoglobin below 10 grams accounted for 40 percent. The average hemoglobin of 785 people was 10.3 grams. These returnees were all healthy before being captured, were not injured, did not bleed, and did not undergo surgery or suffer from any diseases that could cause anemia during their captivity. There is no doubt that the only common factor in the emergence of such widespread anemia is the inhuman and harsh semi-starvation nutritional treatment in the U.S. military POW camps.
    From the above facts, no one can deny that the food treatment and environment provided by the U.S. military in the POW camps to captured personnel of the Volunteer Army were very poor. Because only very poor nutrition and environment can produce such widespread and significant nutritional deficiencies, emaciation, weakness, edema, anemia, and various vitamin deficiencies.
    According to the materials we have, in the U.S. military POW camps, our captured personnel were often subjected to brutal treatment of killing, terror, and beatings, and were often forced to do hard labor. The nutrition obtained was very low in quality and quantity, and the prisoners of war often lived in a state of semi-starvation, suffering from mental threats and physical injuries and excessive fatigue, which would have a great adverse impact on appetite and digestion. Moreover, the U.S. military often implemented inhumane acts of cutting off food to mistreat prisoners of war. All the returnees who were forced to work as cooks in the U.S. military POW camps unanimously revealed the extreme deterioration of nutrition in the U.S. military POW camps. According to their conversations, we conducted investigations and analysis, and the conclusion was: the diet provided to prisoners of war in the U.S. military POW camps was not only greatly insufficient in calories (heat units), but also very lacking in fat, protein (meat and fat were not visible at all), Vitamin A, Vitamin B (riboflavin), and Vitamin C. Captured personnel in the U.S. military POW camps were often in a state of semi-starvation. The materials provided by the cooks are completely consistent with the phenomena of various widespread nutritional deficiency diseases found in our clinical objective examinations. There is no doubt that the person in charge of the U.S. military POW camps violated the clear provisions of the Geneva Convention of August 12, 1949: "The daily basic ration shall be sufficient in quantity, quality, and variety to maintain the health of prisoners of war and prevent weight loss or malnutrition."
    II. The poor sanitation in the U.S. military POW camps caused the widespread emergence and rapid development of tuberculosis. Among 567 internal medicine cases, we found that 230 (accounting for 40.6 percent) had pulmonary tuberculosis. Moreover, the onset or aggravation of each clinical symptom was inseparable from the poor conditions and violence in the U.S. military POW camps.
    According to our investigation, among the 230 tuberculosis cases, 186 (accounting for 80.9 percent) had suffered from the poison of the U.S. military's violence, and 140 of these 186 cases (accounting for 75.3 percent) developed pulmonary tuberculosis as a result, and 46 cases further expanded and spread the disease quickly due to the U.S. military's inhuman acts of violence and mistreatment. The severe lack of nutrition and extremely poor sanitary environment in the U.S. military POW camps, coupled with inhuman brutality and the non-criminal deprivation of food and water, made the U.S. military POW camps a breeding ground and base camp for the transmission and development of pulmonary tuberculosis. As everyone knows, in addition to medication, the two most basic requirements for treating pulmonary tuberculosis are proper rest and adequate nutrition. However, the U.S. military not only did not give the above-mentioned two items of care that they should have given to patients with pulmonary tuberculosis among captured personnel of our Volunteer Army, but instead carried out various persecutions. This alone is enough to prove that the U.S. military's mistreatment of prisoners of war is not limited to ordinary captured personnel, and even seriously ill pulmonary tuberculosis patients were treated with the same brutality and persecution without any conscience; not to mention any appropriate isolation treatment and recuperation. Many vivid cases of pulmonary tuberculosis prove that the U.S. military seriously violated the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War.
    III. The poor sanitation in the U.S. military POW camps caused widespread and severe chronic respiratory diseases. Among the returnees, 292 (accounting for more than half of the internal medicine cases) suffered from severe chronic respiratory diseases (such as tracheitis, emphysema, bronchiectasis, etc.) due to the poor conditions in the POW camps. Such a high incidence is definitely abnormal and not accidental. The main reason is due to the poor conditions in the POW camps. The onset of the above cases occurred after being captured. Even if there was a history of coughing before, there were no respiratory symptoms at the time of capture. The investigation and analysis of all cases fully proves that this severe respiratory disease of our sick and wounded captured personnel is closely related to the terrible, cruel, and inhuman physical injuries and mental trauma suffered in the POW camps. According to detailed investigations, 46 percent of the cases occurred immediately after suffering from the U.S. military's poison gas attacks in the POW camps, water torture (taking off clothes in winter and standing in cold water pools day and night), pouring chili water into the nostrils, wind blowing and snow freezing, forced hard labor, beatings, imprisonment, and other inhuman acts of violence. Even after the onset of the disease, the U.S. military continued to inflict violence on the prisoners of war, forcing them to do hard labor, and the prisoners of war suffered unspeakable physical and mental trauma. At the same time, the amount of food issued daily was far less than half full, and its quality was very poor. In this harsh environment, the great epidemic of respiratory infections was inevitable; at the same time, there was no isolation, rest, or treatment. Patients suffered from prolonged illness and became chronic, and there were special factors involved. Now these people with chronic respiratory diseases caused by the U.S. military's violence are no longer able to work, and the long-term pain of this chronic disease they suffer is often more than that of war injuries. All these patients are living examples that can prove the U.S. military's violence and mistreatment of captured personnel of our Volunteer Army and cannot be denied.
    IV. The U.S. military POW camps adopted means of violence and persecution against prisoners of war. Among 1,609 returnees (including surgical cases), almost without exception, they had often suffered various tortures and beatings in the U.S. military POW camps, such as hitting with wooden sticks or iron bars, kicking, stabbing with knives, attacking with machine guns, grenades, poison gas bombs, armored vehicles, tanks, and even burning, freezing, electric shock, pouring chili water into the nostrils, cutting with knives, inserting bamboo nails into fingernails, and other inhuman and barbaric acts of violence. In the investigation of the first batch of 350 sick and injured personnel who were repatriated, 347 (accounting for more than 99 percent) had suffered not only once and various different acts of violence, including 89.4 percent who had been subjected to poison gas attacks, 67.1 percent who had been beaten with sticks, 70.4 percent who had been kicked and punched, 46.5 percent who had been cut off from water and food, 36.3 percent who had been forced to crawl on all fours, 28 percent who had been forced to do hard labor, 10.8 percent who had been imprisoned in solitary confinement, 5.1 percent who had been subjected to electric torture, 2.8 percent who had been stabbed with knives, and 4.6 percent who had been subjected to other acts of violence. On average, each patient had suffered at least five different types of torture; and each different type of torture had been suffered at least more than once, even up to dozens of times. This harsh environment and cruel encounters seriously violated their safety, threatened their survival, and deprived them of the opportunity to recover their health.
    Last year, the U.S. military carried out inhumane bacteriological warfare in Korea and Northeast China. Chinese scientists and world-renowned scientists have confirmed this heinous crime of the U.S. military in violating international conventions and practices with irrefutable facts and evidence. The U.S. military's crimes of persecuting and killing our captured personnel in the POW camps on Geoje Island, Jeju Island, and Beongam Island have long been condemned by peace-loving people around the world. Now, after examining the bodies of our returnees who were fortunate enough to survive and hearing what they said from their hearts, we have found ironclad medical scientific evidence that fully proves the U.S. military's crimes of violating humanity, violating international conventions, and mistreating and persecuting our captured personnel. With incomparable anger, we severely accuse the U.S. military of this barbaric and brutal crime in front of the people of the world.

    我们证实了美军违反国际公约虐待我志愿军被俘人员的残酷行为
    内科教授  钟惠澜
    我曾参加了在朝鲜停战协定签字以前由美方遣返的我方伤病归来人员及停战协定签字后我方非伤病归来人员的健康调查和鉴定工作。参加工作的都是国内的医学专家和权威。我们是很严格地很科学地以实事求是的精神和客观的态度进行工作的。经过数月的细心检查和分析，我们一致地得到了一个共同结论：美军严重地破坏了关于保护战俘健康安全的一九四九年八月十二日日内瓦公约，惨无人道地虐待我志愿军被俘人员。这个结论是建立在铁一般的不可抵赖的客观事实上的，如：（1）由于美军惨无人道地虐待战俘，所以战俘营的营养低劣造成了严重的普遍的营养缺乏症。（2）由于美军惨无人道地虐待战俘，战俘营情况非常恶劣，严重地造成了结核病的广泛产生与迅速发展。（3）由于美军惨无人道地虐待战俘，卫生情况恶劣，造成了大量的严重慢性呼吸道疾病。（4）由于美军惨无人道地虐待战俘，暴行迫害，战俘们受了严重的精神创伤和身体损害。
    现在我把关于内科学方面的美军虐待战俘的事实简单介绍在后面：
    一、所有归来人员的营养缺乏现象是很显著而普遍的。这表现在：（甲）颜色憔悴和身体消瘦的普遍性；（乙）甲种维生素缺乏症的普遍性；（丙）核黄素（乙种维生素的一种）缺乏症的普遍性；（丁）毛细管脆性增加的广泛性。绝大多数的归来人员面有菜色，皮肤干燥而失去润泽。一般衰弱无力，稍运动或上楼梯即觉呼吸短促，多半外表枯老远超于年龄的实数。
    1、体重的普遍减少：归来人员回国后饮食大大改善，但由于在战俘营内曾受到极大的折磨，食欲仍然很差，很多人的饭量只能达到被俘前原来的一半。虽然如此，在一○四五名归来人员中于回国后的二十六天的短期内，除了一部分有营养不良性水肿随饮食改善后水肿消失而体重临时减少外，有百分之八十以上的人已有显著的体重增加。大多数的增加多在两三公斤以上。有一百二十五人，其体重增加了五公斤以上。上述情形充分证明了美军虐待我志愿军被俘人员，经常给他们吃营养缺乏的饮食，造成普遍的体重减低或水肿。除此以外，再也没有其他理由可以解释的了。
    2、各种维生素缺乏症的普遍存在：（一）甲种维生素缺乏症的普遍发生：在一○四五名非伤病归来人员中，我们发现有甲种维生素缺乏症的占百分之八十九·九，包括夜盲症者五百四十六人为百分之五十二·二，毛囊角化者六百五十九人为百分之六十三·一，结合膜色素沉著及毕脱氏斑等者五百二十一人为百分之四十九，其中有不少人是同时有上述二种或三种甲种维生素缺乏症者。（二）核黄素缺乏症的存在也是很普遍的。归来人员中有八百三十三人（占百分之七十九·七）是有这种症状的。例如七百○四人（占百分之六十七·四）有口角炎，九十六人（占百分之九·二）有口腔炎，三十八人（占百分之三·六）有舌炎，四百○八人（占百分之三十九）有阴囊湿疹。（三）关于丙种维生素缺乏症方面，我们曾无选择地检查了四百○七人，发现其中有七十二人（占百分之十七·七）毛细管脆性显著增加，说明丙种维生素缺乏症的存在。
    3、贫血的普遍存在：在非伤病归来人员中我们曾毫无选择地检查了七百八十五人的血色素，发现其中血色素在二十克以下者占百分之八十四，在十克以下者占百分之四十。七百八十五人的平均血色素为十点三克。这些归来人员在被俘前都很健康，未受伤、未出血，在被俘期间未施手术也未患过任何可以产生贫血的疾病。毫无疑问，这样普遍的贫血症，其产生的唯一共同因素为美军战俘营中不合人道的恶劣的半饥饿的营养待遇。
    从上面的事实看来，任何人都无法否认美军在战俘营里所给志愿军被俘人员的饮食待遇和环境都是非常恶劣的。因为惟有非常恶劣的营养和环境才能产生这样普遍的显著的营养缺乏症、消瘦、衰弱、水肿、贫血和各种维生素缺乏等病症。
    根据我们所掌握的材料，在美军战俘营中，我方被俘人员经常遭受杀害、恐怖和毒打的残暴待遇，同时又常常被迫作苦役。而所得营养，质与量均非常低劣，战俘经常是在半饥饿状态中活着，遭受了精神上的威胁和身体上的伤害与过度疲劳，对于食欲与消化是会有很大的不良的影响的。何况美军又经常实行断绝粮食的非人道行为来虐待战俘。归来人员中所有曾在美军战俘营中被迫做炊事员的人员，均一致揭露了美军战俘营内营养的极度恶劣情况。根据他们的谈话，我们曾进行调查分析，所得结论是：美军战俘营里所给战俘的饮食不仅卡量
  （热力单位）大大不够，而且每日食物所含的脂肪、蛋白（根本看不见肉和脂肪）、甲种乙种（核黄素）及丙种维生素等也非常缺乏。美军战俘营里被俘人员，是经常处于半饥饿状态的。炊事员所供的材料，是完全符合于我们临床客观检查所发现的普遍性的种种营养缺乏病症的现象。毫无疑问，美军战俘营负责者是违反了一九四九年八月十二日的日内瓦公约的明确的规定：“每日基本口粮在量、质与种类上应足够保持战俘之健康及防止体重减轻或营养不足”。
    二、美军战俘营中卫生的恶劣情况，造成了结核病广泛产生与迅速发展。在五百六十七名的内科病例中，我们发现了有二百三十名（占百分之四十·六）是有肺结核的。而且每一例临床症状的发作或加重，都是与美军战俘营中的恶劣情况和暴行分不开的。
    根据我们的调查，二百三十个结核病例中，有一百八十六名（占百分之八十·九）是曾经饱受美军暴行的毒害的，而这一百八十六例中有一百四十例（占百分之七十五·三）因此发生了肺结核，其中四十六例更因美军惨无人道的暴行虐待，很快使病情扩大和散布起来。美军战俘营里的营养严重缺乏，卫生环境极端恶劣；同时加上惨无人道的残暴、非刑的断粮断水，这样美军战俘营就成了制造肺结核传染和发展的温床与大本营。众所周知，治疗肺结核除了药物以外有两个最基本的要求，就是适当的休养与充分的营养。但美军对于我志愿军被俘人员之肺结核的患者，不仅没有给予应有的上述两项照顾，反而进行了种种迫害，即此一端足以证明美军虐待战俘的暴行，不限于一般普通被俘人员，甚至于对严重肺结核者也毫无心肝地同样地施以暴行迫害；更谈不到什么适当的隔离治疗和休养了。很多活鲜鲜的肺结核病例证明了美军严重地违反了日内瓦优待战俘的公约。
    三、美军战俘营中卫生的恶劣情况，造成了广泛的严重的慢性呼吸道病。在归来人员中有二百九十二人（占内科病例半数以上）是由于战俘营的恶劣情况，患了严重的慢性呼吸道疾病（如气管炎、肺气肿、支气管扩张等）。这样高的病发数，肯定地是反常的，更不是偶然的，其主要原因是由于战俘营中恶劣情况所造成的。上述病例的发作都是在被俘以后，偶有以前曾有咳嗽病历者，在被俘时也并无呼吸道症状。所有病例的调查分析，完全证明我方伤病被俘人员这种严重的呼吸道病是与在战俘营中所遭受的恐怖的、残酷的、非人道的身体上的伤害和精神上的创伤有重大关系的。根据详细调查，百分之四十六的病例是在遭受战俘营美军的毒气袭击，水牢虐待（冬天脱去衣服，日夜站在冷水池内），由鼻孔灌辣椒水，风吹雪冻，强迫苦役，毒打，坐牢等非人道暴行后随即发生的。甚至于疾病发作后，美军仍继续对战俘加以暴行，强迫作苦役，战俘身体和精神饱受了不可言喻的创伤。同时每日所发粮食，远不及半饱之量，而其质量又非常低劣，在此恶劣情况下呼吸道感染的盛大流行自属必然的；同时也谈不到隔离、休养与治疗，患者久病不愈，病变成慢性，实有特殊因素存在。现在这些由于美军暴行所造成的有慢性呼吸道病的人，已经不能工作，他们所遭受的这种慢性病的长期痛苦，较之战伤往往有过之无不及。所有这些病人，都是可以证明美军采取暴行虐待我志愿军被俘人员而无法抵赖的活的例子。
    四、美军战俘营对战俘采取暴行迫害的手段，在一六○九名归来人员中（包括外科病例）几乎没有例外地都曾在美军战俘营中经常遭受了各种酷刑和毒打，如用木棍或铁条打击，脚踢，刀刺，用机枪、手榴弹、毒气弹、装甲车、坦克车袭击，甚至于火烧，受冻，电触，由鼻孔灌辣椒水，刀割，指甲插竹钉等非人道的野蛮暴行。单就调查第一批被遣返归来的三百五十名有病受伤人员中就有三百四十七名（占百分之九十九以上）曾遭受过不只一次及各种不同的暴行，计曾受毒气弹袭击者占百分之八十九·四，棍打者占百分之六十七·一，脚踢拳打者百分之七十·四，断水断粮者百分之四十六·五，四肢爬行者百分之三十六·三，强迫苦工者百分之二十八，单人隔离坐牢者百分之十·八，电刑者百分之五·一，刀刺者百分之二·八，受其他暴行者百分之四·六。平均每一病者曾遭受至少五种不同类型的暴刑；而每种不同类型的暴刑，也至少不只一次，甚至有多至数十次者。这种恶劣的环境和残酷的遭遇，严重地侵害了他们的安全，威胁了他们的生存，剥夺了他们恢复健康的机会。
    去年美军在朝鲜和我国东北进行了灭绝人性的细菌战，我国科学家和世界知名的科学家曾以无可辩驳的大量事实和证据，证实了美军这一违反国际公约和惯例的滔天罪行。美军在巨济岛、济州岛和蜂岩岛战俘营里迫害和屠杀我方被俘人员的罪行，也早已受到世界爱好和平人民的谴责。现在，从检查庆幸生还的我归来人员的身体和听到他们心里说出来的话以后，我们发现了铁一般的医学科学证据，完全证明了美军违反人道，破坏国际公约，虐待和迫害我方被俘人员的罪行。我们以无比的愤怒，在全世界人民面前严重地控诉美军这种野蛮残暴的罪行。3456789
