From the Perspective of a Large-Scale Rolling Mill to See the Significance of Developing Heavy Industry
Sun Ying

China's first Five-Year Plan prioritizes the development of heavy industry. Why is it necessary to develop heavy industry first? The construction of the Anshan Iron and Steel (Ansteel) Large-Scale Rolling Mill and its role in the national economy can answer this question.

From the Perspective of the Main Products of the Large-Scale Rolling Mill:

The large-scale rolling mill can produce steel rails. During the first Five-Year Plan, its output can meet the needs of new railway lines across the country, thus providing an important guarantee for the national plan to build new railway lines.

As everyone knows, building railways is an important condition for developing industry and the national economy. It has a large transportation capacity and low transportation costs. Without railways, the rich mineral resources buried underground cannot be exploited on a large scale, and even if they are, they cannot be transported out in large quantities. Without railways, large machinery cannot be transported; for example, the large-scale rolling mill alone requires over ten thousand tons of machinery and equipment, and some large components weigh dozens of tons each. It is fundamentally impossible to build modern factories in places without railways. Without railways, even if resources are abundant, they cannot be sold externally in large quantities, and industrial products cannot be transported and sold to the rural areas inland. The construction of railways will quickly change this situation. The Tianlan Railway in the Northwest transported over two million tons of goods in its first year of operation. If these goods were transported from Xi'an to Lanzhou using one thousand trucks, it would take over twenty years to complete the task. The goods transported into the Northwest region via the Tianlan Railway mostly consist of steel products, cement, timber, and building materials, which play a significant role in the development of Gansu Province's industry. Lanzhou City has now established a fully mechanized woolen mill. After the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway in Sichuan Province was opened to traffic, the Yida Coal Mine in Longchang County not only sold all the coal that had been stockpiled for more than ten years, but also expanded its production by more than double. The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway also transported a large number of industrial products, new agricultural tools, chemical fertilizers, and daily necessities to the countryside, thereby narrowing the price gap between industrial and agricultural products. Farmers in western Sichuan used to have to sell fifteen jin of tobacco leaves to buy a bamboo-shelled thermos, but now they only need six jin. Farmers in Jianyang County used to have to sell twenty jin of rice to buy one chi of cloth, but now only five jin of rice is enough. Railways are so important, and to build railways, you need steel rails. Now, with the help of the Soviet Union, China has built a large-scale rolling mill. From now on, China will be able to manufacture steel rails in large quantities by itself, without having to buy them from foreign countries.

The large-scale rolling mill can also produce various large-sized steel, angle steel, channel steel, I-beams, and other types. This large-sized steel is an indispensable building material in industrial construction. The factory buildings of any modern factory, railway bridges, tractors, and the frames and bases of huge machines all require large-sized steel. When we walk into the factory buildings of a large-scale rolling mill, we can feel the height and size of the buildings, and we can also see large overhead cranes, one or two dozen meters long, running back and forth along the beams. What material can support thousands of tons of steel and building materials? That is the huge steel columns and beams constructed from large-sized steel, the dense steel frames visible overhead. These steel columns, beams, and frames are welded together by metal structure workers using large and medium-sized angle steel, channel steel, and I-beams. Only such a factory building structure can withstand the enormous vibrations generated by the operation of all the machines, and can support the stable movement of dozens of tons of overhead cranes along the steel beams. However, in the past, China could not produce large-sized steel, and to use it, we had to order it from abroad. Now, we are carrying out planned economic construction, and many important projects require large-sized steel. The Soviet Union alone plans to help us design and build one hundred and forty-one large-scale projects, and none of these large projects can do without large-sized steel. Now, the Soviet Union has helped China build a large-scale rolling mill in the first year of the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan, enabling China to mainly solve the problem of large-sized steel by itself, creating a necessary condition for us to build an independent industry. From now on, we can produce large-sized steel according to our construction needs, without having to completely rely on foreign orders, and we can free up a large amount of foreign exchange for use in other more important construction projects.

The large-scale rolling mill can also produce seamless steel pipe billets, keels for ships and warships. These products are indispensable for industrial construction and strengthening national defense.

The completion of the large-scale rolling mill has even greater significance for changing the face of China's iron and steel industry.

Like other heavy industries, China's iron and steel industry was very backward in the past, and it was not independent. The vast majority of factories and mines were in the hands of imperialist countries. The purpose of imperialism in opening iron mines and establishing smelting factories in China was to plunder China's iron and steel, develop their own industries, and in turn, use them to deepen their aggression against China. The result of imperialist plunder was the semi-colonial nature of China's iron and steel industry in the past. The amount of iron ore mined exceeded the amount of iron smelted, the amount of iron smelted exceeded the amount of steel made, and the amount of steel made exceeded the amount of steel rolled. In other words, China had few blast furnaces for smelting iron, and lacked the capacity to smelt all the mined iron ore into iron; it had few open-hearth furnaces for making steel, and could not turn all the iron it produced into steel; and it had even less equipment for rolling steel, and could not roll the steel ingots and billets into useful steel. The iron sand, the iron, the steel ingots and billets produced in China could not be rolled into useful materials for China's industrial construction, but were mostly transported away by imperialists. When China needed them, it had to buy them from the imperialists at high prices, and it might not even be able to buy them; the imperialists would not allow China to develop its industry.

In order to develop industry, we must change the unreasonable state of the semi-colonial nature of industry in the old China, change our dependence on imperialism, and strive to build our own independent industry. In terms of the iron and steel industry, we must gradually balance China's mining, iron smelting, steelmaking, and steel rolling capabilities in the process of restoration and development. Over the past few years, Anshan Iron and Steel Company has carried out planned restoration, expansion, and new construction projects. It has restored blast furnaces and transformed some blast furnaces into automated ones, continuously improving iron smelting capacity; it has restored and renovated open-hearth furnaces, continuously improving steelmaking capacity; and it has established a highly mechanized and automated large-scale rolling mill and seamless steel pipe plant, improving steel rolling capacity. From now on, Anshan Iron and Steel Company can not only roll medium and small-sized steel, but also roll large-sized steel, giving fuller play to its role and becoming a base for supporting the country's industrial construction.

Now it is not difficult to understand that a large-scale rolling mill is an indispensable factory for China's industrial development and national defense consolidation. Factories like this are of decisive significance for China's implementation of national socialist industrialization, and are the industries that lay the foundation for China's industrialization. China's first Five-Year Plan must first concentrate its efforts on developing heavy industry, which refers to the construction of these types of factories. That is the one hundred and forty-one large-scale projects that the Soviet government has decided to help China build and renovate by 1959.

However, building such factories is extremely difficult. The completion of the large-scale rolling mill is inseparable from the Soviet Union's comprehensive and selfless assistance, from design, equipment supply, guidance on construction, installation, and commissioning, to the trial production of new products. In order to help China build this factory, the Soviet government mobilized thousands of outstanding designers to help us with the design; more than thirty factories in cities such as Moscow and Leningrad manufactured equipment for us, and provided us with this top-quality equipment on time; and they also sent first-class experts, design, geological survey, construction, electrical installation, mechanical installation, electrical adjustment, and steel rolling experts to China to specifically guide us in the preparation, construction, installation, and production work of the large-scale rolling mill. Many of the precision machines and advanced technologies for building this huge project were something that our cadres, technicians, and workers had never seen or heard of before. People participating in the construction of the two factories will all tell you in unison: without Soviet experts, we would encounter many insurmountable difficulties.

The large-scale rolling mill is also the great result of the labor and wisdom of all the participating employees. All workers, engineers, technicians, and managers actively learn from the Soviet Union, resolutely implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, give full play to their high labor enthusiasm, learn technology, continuously improve technology, and combine labor creativity with science and technology to overcome all difficulties in construction. Let us cite some examples to illustrate this.

As early as the stage of preparing for construction, Soviet experts proposed that construction should be mechanized and factory-based. To ensure the success of the two major projects of the large-scale rolling mill and the seamless steel pipe plant, it was necessary to build some auxiliary factories, such as a wood model factory, a steel bar factory, and a concrete mixing plant. However, at that time, we had not yet recognized the necessity of auxiliary factories, and we still treated new projects with old perspectives. Some people were not active in promoting mechanized and factory-based construction. For example, when it came to building a concrete mixing plant, they were thinking: is it worth building a special factory to mix concrete? That way, the mixed concrete would have to be transported back and forth, which would be a waste! Wouldn't it be enough to assign a few more concrete mixers to each construction site? Soviet experts repeatedly explained the necessity of mechanized and factory-based construction to our cadres, actively helped us overcome difficulties, carried out design, and established a concrete mixing plant. Until the construction of the large-scale rolling mill site was fully underway, the importance of the concrete mixing plant became very clear. Without this factory, it would have been impossible to supply the two major projects with 80,000 cubic meters of concrete within six months according to the schedule. Without this factory, no matter how high the workers' enthusiasm was, it would have been impossible to quickly complete such a huge concrete pouring project in a handicraft manner. With such a factory, conditions were created for the workers. Initially, only a few people could master the machines of the concrete mixing plant. After the mixing plant started operating, it quickly trained forty-two skilled workers in the first batch, and after a few months, it trained more than two hundred skilled workers. Originally, there was not a single batching worker in the whole factory, but later more than one hundred people were trained to master the batching work. Mechanized equipment, coupled with the workers' enthusiasm to complete the task, their skilled technology, and their selfless spirit of labor, they created labor miracles. Last year, during the severe winter construction, they completed the task of pouring 3,300 cubic meters of concrete in three days, completed the largest No. 11 foundation in the entire factory, and guaranteed the quality.

Construction was about to begin. According to the layout of the drawings, preparations were made to start construction on the factory floor. On the 40,000 to 50,000 square meter factory area, more than ten thousand tons of machinery and equipment would be installed, all of which would be electrically operated. Just the foundations for the machines alone numbered several hundred, large and small. During construction, it was not possible to start at the east end and proceed to the west end, working on one machine at a time, one foundation at a time. It was necessary to carry out parallel construction underground, on the ground, and in the air, according to accurate measurements. Speaking only of digging foundations, each foundation is the base of a machine. It is not simply a solid piece of reinforced concrete. Inside there are various pipes that are interconnected; large foundations also have "basements" (some machines are installed below ground). Many foundations are constructed simultaneously. If the measurements are not accurate, they will not align, or they will squeeze together, causing major rework. Therefore, during measurement, it is necessary to first find a benchmark point for the entire factory. Starting from this point, two vertical baselines, north-south and east-west, are established in order to accurately determine the position of each foundation. When we sit in the office and think about it, this should be a very simple matter. However, in reality, this measurement work became a major key issue for starting work during a certain period. Measurements were taken several times, but they did not align. The first time the benchmark point and baseline were measured well, the second time they could not be accurately located again. Initially, a wooden stake was driven into the benchmark point. However, on the chaotic construction site, people came and went, and someone would walk over or some building materials would be transported over and knock it askew or crush it. Later, a desperate method was devised. A ton of concrete was poured around the benchmark point, and an iron stake was installed in the middle. This should not be a problem, right? Who knew that after a heavy rain, the soil around it loosened and the benchmark point tilted again. After many lessons, our measurement workers finally found the trick and solved this problem.

Installing more than ten thousand tons of extremely precise machines is an even more complex and meticulous task. The four production sections of the entire factory, group by group of machines, are tightly connected by conveyor roller tables, so the installation requirements are very strict. The centerlines and elevations of all machines must not have any error. If the error in the centerline exceeds one millimeter, then the previous process and the next process will not align; if the elevation differs by half a millimeter, the height of the front and rear machines will be different. In the process of highly mechanized and automated production, the machines turn so fast and the steel materials are fed so urgently that accidents will occur and the life of the machine will be shortened. However, some engineers and technicians initially saw that the Soviet design drawings required such strictness, and based on their old views, they believed that it was an excessive requirement; such strictness had no practical significance. This is not surprising, because in China, no one had ever seen such a highly mechanized and automated factory, and of course, it was difficult to understand the reason for such strict technical requirements. However, the machines assembled from thousands and hundreds of parts and components are very complex and precise. If anyone is careless, it will cause rework and make the machine unable to operate.

The above examples are sufficient to illustrate that in order to build large-scale modern projects, our knowledge and experience, our technical strength, are still far behind. We cannot be greedy for more. We must gradually cultivate our construction team and strength in key construction projects in order to meet the needs of the country's planned construction and build batches of modern large factories on an increasingly expanding scale.

The vastness of the large-scale rolling mill project and the technical complexity not only require the hard work of those directly participating in the construction, but also depend on the support of the whole country. Cadres, skilled workers, and technicians require the support of the whole country; many machines and materials that China can manufacture itself require the support of the whole country. In this regard, the people of the whole country and the fraternal factories recognize the significance of key projects for the country's future and the people's happiness, endure and overcome their own difficulties, and try their best to meet the needs of Anshan's construction. Since April 1952, forty-eight provinces and cities across the country have sent a large number of cadres, engineers, technicians, workers, and graduates from universities and specialized schools to Anshan. More than two thousand Party members and League members were transferred from various parts of the Northeast alone; the machinery manufacturing industry in major cities across the country has accepted orders from Anshan Iron and Steel Company. A total of seventy-six enterprises manufactured machinery, equipment, instruments, building materials, and fuel for the two factories, including many materials that had never been made before. Shenyang, Dalian, and other places allocated a large number of vehicles to strengthen Ansteel's transportation capacity. The railway bureau ensured that the materials transported to Ansteel would not be backlogged; the trade departments and cooperatives ensured the supply of grain and daily necessities to Anshan employees, and suburban farmers grew more vegetables to supply workers with non-staple foods. The problem is very clear: under China's existing conditions, to build projects like the large-scale rolling mill and the seamless steel pipe plant, it is by no means something that Anshan Iron and Steel Company alone or the strength of a certain region can accomplish, but it requires the people of the whole country to go all out.

The completion of the large-scale rolling mill clearly educated us: building heavy industry requires huge technical forces and even more huge amounts of funds. In order to gradually establish these key factories necessary for national industrialization and national defense modernization, the people of the whole country must work hard, carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, accumulate construction funds, and concentrate the country's manpower, material resources, and financial resources in order to guarantee the full completion of the construction of one hundred and forty-one large-scale projects that the Soviet government decided to help China build and renovate according to the plan.

The completion of the large-scale rolling mill also tells us: in construction, our difficulties are multifaceted, our tasks are arduous, but as long as we can follow the guidelines and policies indicated by the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, with the great help of the Soviet Union, the people of the whole country and the working class of the whole country sincerely learn from the Soviet Union, give full play to the working class's selfless labor and self-sacrificing spirit, we will be able to overcome all difficulties, and in the process of construction, cultivate our technical forces and management cadres, build large-scale modern factories, and gradually realize the country's socialist industrialization.

    从大型轧钢厂来看发展重工业的意义
    孙英
    我国第一个五年计划，首先要发展重工业。为什么一定要首先发展重工业？鞍钢大型轧钢厂的建成和它对国民经济的作用，可以解答这个问题。
    从大型轧钢厂的主要产品来看：
    大型轧钢厂能轧制钢轨，它的产量，在第一个五年计划期间，能够满足全国新修铁路线的需要，全国修筑铁路新线的计划，因而有了重要的保证。
    大家都知道，修铁路，是建设工业和发展国民经济的一个重要条件，它的运输力大，运输成本低。没有铁路，地下埋藏的丰富的矿产，不能大规模开采，就是开采了，也不能大量运出来。没有铁路，大型的机器就不能运去；像大型轧钢厂，光是机器设备就有一万几千吨重，大的部件一个就有好几十吨，没有铁路的地方，要建立现代化的工厂，根本不可能。没有铁路，就是物产再丰富，也不能大量外销，工业品也没法运销到内地农村去。修了铁路，就会很快改变这种种情况。西北的天兰路通车一年，就运输了二百多万吨货物。这些货物，如果用一千辆汽车，从西安运到兰州，要二十几年才运得完。经过天兰路运进西北地区的货物中，大部分都是钢铁制品、水泥、木材和建筑材料，对于发展甘肃省的工业有很大的作用，现在兰州市已建立起一座完全机械化的毛织厂。四川省的成渝铁路通车以后，隆昌县的义大煤矿，不但把积压十多年的煤都运销出去，而且还扩大了生产一倍以上。成渝铁路也把大批工业品、新式农具、化学肥料和日用品运到农村去，工农业产品的差价因而缩小。川西农民过去卖十五斤烟叶才能买到一个竹壳热水瓶，现在只要六斤就成了；简阳县农民从前要卖二十斤大米才能买一尺布，现在只要五斤大米就够了。铁路这样重要，要修铁路，就得有钢轨。现在苏联帮助我国建成了大型轧钢厂，从此，我国就能够大量自造钢轨，再用不着到国外去买了。
    大型轧钢厂还能轧制各种大型钢材，角钢、槽钢、工字钢和其他种类的。这种大型钢材，是工业建设中不能缺少的建筑材料。任何一个现代化工厂的厂房，铁路桥梁，拖拉机和巨大机器的机架机座，都需用大型钢材。我们走进大型轧钢厂的厂房，都会感觉到厂房建筑的高大，也能看到一、二十公尺长的大吊车，沿着房梁来往奔驰。什么材料能够支持起几千吨重的钢铁和建筑材料，那就是用大型钢材构造的巨大钢柱、钢梁，就是抬头可见的密密层层的钢架，这些钢柱、钢梁和钢架，都是由金属结构工人把大型、中型的三角钢、槽钢和工字钢焊结而成的。只有这样的厂房结构，才能经得住全部机器开动起来所发出的巨大震动，才能支持得住几十吨重的大吊车沿着钢梁平稳地开来开去。可是，过去我国不能轧制大型钢材，要用它，都得到国外订货。现在，我们要进行有计划的经济建设，很多重要工程都需用大型钢材，单是苏联准备帮助我们设计和建设的就有一百四十一项巨大工程，这些大工程，那一个也离不开大型钢材。现在，苏联帮助我国在第一个五年计划实施的第一年里，就建成了大型轧钢厂，使我国能以自己解决主要部分的大型钢材，为我们建设独立的工业创造了一个必备的条件。从此，我们可以按照我国建设的需要，来生产大型钢材，不用完全依赖国外订货，并且能够腾出大量外汇，使用到其他更重要的建设上去。
    大型轧钢厂还可以出产无缝钢管管胚，轮船和兵舰的龙骨。这些产品对于建设工业和加强国防都是不可少的。
    大型轧钢厂的建成，对于改变我国钢铁工业的面貌，还有更加重大的意义。
    我国钢铁工业，也和其他重工业一样，过去是很落后的，并且不能独立的，绝大部分的厂矿是在帝国主义国家手里。帝国主义在中国开铁矿，办冶炼工厂，它的目的，是在掠夺我国的钢铁，发展它们自己的工业，转过来，用来加深对我国的侵略。帝国主义掠夺的结果，造成我国过去钢铁工业上的半殖民地性质，铁矿开采量超过炼铁量，炼铁量超过炼钢量，炼钢量又超过轧钢量。换句话说，就是我国炼铁的高炉少，没有能力把开采出来的铁矿石都炼成铁；炼钢的平炉少，不能把自己出的铁都炼成钢；轧钢的设备更少，不能把钢锭钢胚轧成有用的钢材。我国出的铁砂，出的铁，制成的钢锭钢胚，自己不能轧成有用之材，供给我国工业建设，却多被帝国主义运走了。我国要用的时候，反要向帝国主义出大价钱去买，还不一定能买到；帝国主义是不让我国发展工业的。
    为了发展工业，我们就要改变旧中国时代工业上的半殖民地性的不合理状态，改变对帝国主义的依赖性，努力建设自己独立的工业。在钢铁工业方面来说，要在恢复和发展过程中，逐步平衡我国采矿、炼铁、炼钢和轧钢的能力。鞍山钢铁公司几年来，进行了有计划的恢复、扩建和新建的工程。修复高炉，并把有些高炉改建成自动化的，不断提高了炼铁的能力；修复和改建平炉，不断提高了炼钢能力；建立高度机械化自动化的大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂，提高了轧钢的能力。从此，鞍山钢铁公司，不但能轧制中型和小型的钢材，并且能够轧制大型钢材，更全面地发挥它的作用，成为支援全国进行工业建设的基地。
    现在就不难明白，大型轧钢厂是一个为我国发展工业、巩固国防所必不可少的工厂。像这样的工厂，对于我国实行国家的社会主义工业化，是有决定意义的，是给我国工业化打基础的工业。我国的第一个五年计划，首先必须集中力量发展重工业，就是指的要建设这一类的工厂。那就是苏联政府决定到一九五九年为止，将要帮助我国新建和改建的一百四十一项规模巨大的工程。
    但是，要建设这样的工厂，是十分艰巨的。大型轧钢厂的建成，是离不开苏联的全面的无私的援助的，从设计、供应设备、指导建筑、安装和开工运转，一直到新产品的试制。为了帮助我国建设这座工厂，苏联政府动员了成千的优秀设计人员，帮助我们进行设计；莫斯科、列宁格勒等城市三十多个工厂，为我们制造设备，并且按时把这些头等质量的设备，供给我们；又选派来第一流的专家，设计、地质勘察、建筑、电气安装、机械安装、电气调整和轧钢等等专家前来我国，具体指导我们进行建设大型轧钢厂的准备、施工、安装和生产工作。建设这个巨大工程的许多精密机器和先进技术，是我们的干部、技术人员和工人，从来没有见过、没有听说过的。参加两厂建设的人们，都会异口同声地告诉你：离开苏联专家，我们就会碰到许多克服不了的困难。
    大型轧钢厂也是参加建设的全体职工劳动和智慧的伟大成果。全体工人、工程技术人员和管理人员，积极地向苏联学习，坚决执行苏联专家的建议，充分发挥了高度的劳动热忱，学习技术，不断提高技术，把劳动的创造性和科学技术结合起来，克服了建设中的一切困难。让我们举些例子来看一看。
    还在准备施工的阶段，苏联专家就老早提出，施工要机械化和工厂化。为了保证大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂两大工程，必须建设一些附属工厂，木模厂、钢筋厂、混凝土搅拌厂等等。但是，当时，我们还没有认识附属工厂的必要性，还用老眼光来对待新工程。有些人对于施工机械化工厂化并不积极，比如说，建立混凝土搅拌厂吧，他们在想着：搅拌混凝土，值得专门建立一个工厂吗？那样，搅拌出来的混凝土，还得来回运输，多浪费啊！一个工地上，多分配上几台混凝土搅拌机，不就行了。苏联专家反复对我们的干部说明施工机械化工厂化的必要性，积极帮助我们克服困难，进行设计，建立起了混凝土搅拌厂。直到大型轧钢厂工地工程全部展开以后，混凝土搅拌工厂的重要性，就十分清楚了。要是没有这个工厂，就不可能按着进度在六个月内供给了两大工程八万立方公尺的混凝土。要是没有这座工厂，工人的劳动积极性再高，也不可能用手工业的方式，迅速完成这样巨大的混凝土浇灌工程。有了这样的工厂，才给工人创造了条件，起初，只有很少人能掌握混凝土搅拌工厂的机器，搅拌厂开工后，很快就培养出四十二个第一批熟练工人，过了几个月，就培养出二百多名熟练工人。原来全厂一个配料工人也没有，后来培养出一百多人能够掌握配料工作。机械化设备，加上工人为完成任务的积极性、熟练的技术和忘我劳动的精神，他们创造出劳动的奇迹。去年在严寒的冬季里施工，三天里完成了浇灌三千三百立方公尺混凝土的任务，完成了全厂最大的十一号基础，并且保证了质量。
    施工要开始了，按照图纸的布置，准备开始在工厂的地面上动工。在四、五万平方公尺的厂房面积上，将来要安装上一万几千吨的机器设备，都是用电气操纵。光是安机器的基础就有大大小小好几百个，施工时又不能从东头到西头，一个机器一个机器、一个基础一个基础的挨着动工，需要按照准确的测量，进行地下、地面和空中的平行施工。单说挖基础，每个基础是一台机器的底座，它不简单是一块实心的钢筋混凝土，里边有各种管道，互相衔接；大的基础里还有“地下室”（有的机器，一部分是安装在地面以下的），许多基础，同时施工，要不测量准确，就会对不上头，或者挤到一起去了，造成大返工。所以在测量的时候，首先要找出全厂的一个基点，从这一点出发，定下南北、东西两根垂直的母线，才能够精确地测定每一个基础的位置。我们坐在办公室上想起来，这该是多么简单的事。可是，实际上这个测量工作，却成为一个时期里开工的重大关键问题。测量了好几次，都对不上头，基点和母线第一次测量好了，第二次又找不准了。起初在基点上打个木桩，可是，乱纷纷的工地上，人来人往，不知谁走过来，或者是什么建筑材料运过来，就把它碰歪了，压倒了。后来，想了个死办法，在基点周围灌上一吨重的一块混凝土，中间安上一根铁桩子，这样应该没有问题了吧。那知道下了大雨，四周的土松了，基点又歪了。经过多次的教训，我们的测量工作者，才找到了窍门，解决了这个难题。
    安装一万几千吨极其精密的机器，更是一件复杂和细致的工作。全厂四个生产工段，一组一组的机器，都是用传送辊道紧连起来，因此安装的要求十分严格。所有机器的中心线和标高，不能有毫厘之差。如果中心线的误差超过一公厘，那么，上一道工序和下一道工序，就对不上头；如果标高差了半公厘，前后机器高低不一样，在高度机械化和自动化的生产过程中，机器转得那么快，钢料送得那么急，就会出事故，就会缩短机器寿命。可是有些工程技术人员，起初看到苏联设计图纸上，要求那样严格，根据他们的老看法，认为是过分的要求；那么严格，没有什么实际的意义。这是难怪的，因为在中国，还没有人见过这样高度机械化和自动化的工厂，当然，也很难理解技术上这样要求严格的道理。可是，成千成百的部件和零件，装配起来的机器，十分复杂和精密，谁要是粗枝大叶一些，就会造成返工，就会使机器开不动。
    上面这些例子，就已经足够说明了，为了建设规模巨大的现代化工程，我们的知识和经验，我们的技术力量，还差得很远，我们不能贪多，要在重点建设中逐步培养起我们的建设队伍和力量才能适应国家有计划的建设的需要，在日益扩大的规模上，建设一批一批现代化的大工厂。
    大型轧钢厂浩大的工程和技术上的复杂性，不仅要求直接参加建设的人们艰苦奋斗，并且有赖于全国的支援。干部、技术工人、技术人员，要求全国支援；我国能够自制的许多机器和材料，要求全国支援。在这一方面，全国人民和各兄弟工厂，认识到重点工程对于国家前途、人民幸福的意义，忍受和克服了自己的困难，尽量满足鞍山建设的要求。从一九五二年四月起，全国有四十八个省和市，给鞍山输送去大批干部、工程技术人员、工人和大学、专科学校毕业的学生，光是从东北各地抽调的党员和团员就有两千以上；全国各大城市的机器制造业，很多都接受了鞍山钢铁公司的订货，共有七十六个企业单位为两厂制造机器设备、仪器、建筑材料和燃料，其中，有很多器材，是过去没有制作过的。沈阳、旅大各地调拨去了大批汽车，加强鞍钢的运输力量，铁路局保证运往鞍钢的材料不积压；贸易部门和合作社保证供应鞍山职工的粮食和日用品，市郊农民多种蔬菜，供给工人的副食品。问题很清楚，在我国现有的条件下，要建设像大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂的这样工程，决不是一个鞍山钢铁公司的力量，或者某一个地区的力量所能办到的，而是要求全国人民，全力以赴。
    大型轧钢厂的建成清楚地教育了我们：建设重工业，需要巨大的技术力量，更需要巨额的资金。为了逐步建立起这些为国家工业化和国防现代化所必需的重点工厂，我们全国人民必须艰苦奋斗，开展增产节约运动，积累建设资金，集中全国的人力、物力、财力，才能保证按照计划全部完成苏联政府决定帮助我国新建和改建的一百四十一项规模巨大的工程建设。
      大型轧钢厂的建成也告诉了我们：在建设中，我们的困难是多方面的，我们的任务是艰巨的，但是，我们只要能够照着中国共产党和伟大领袖毛主席所指示的方针和政策，在苏联伟大的帮助之下，全国人民和全国工人阶级，诚心诚意地学习苏联，发挥工人阶级忘我的劳动和自我牺牲的精神，是能够战胜一切困难，并且在建设过程中，培养起我们的技术力量和管理干部，建设起规模巨大的现代化工厂，逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化。
