    The current situation in Korea has become serious due to the U.S. side's use of espionage tactics to sabotage the explanation work to prisoners of war by the Korean and Chinese side, and its use of delaying tactics to bring the political conference talks to a standstill. On December 7th, Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, through United Nations Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld and United Nations General Assembly President Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, sent a notice to the United Nations General Assembly, outlining this serious situation. Foreign Minister Zhou said in the notice: "The current serious situation in Korea is entirely caused by the U.S. government's sinister policy of attempting to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement, forcibly detain prisoners of war, and obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue in order to continue maintaining international tension. This situation has not only dealt a blow to the world's people's desire for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, but is also brewing serious consequences." The United Nations General Assembly should pay serious attention to this serious situation in the Korean issue. All governments and people of all countries who desire a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the easing of world tensions should also pay serious attention and unite to stop the U.S. government's sinister conspiracies.

    The U.S. government's instigation of the Li-Chiang special agents to sabotage the Korean and Chinese side's explanation work to prisoners of war, making it impossible to implement the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's "Terms of Reference," is an important reason for the current serious situation in Korea. The explanation work for prisoners of war not directly repatriated is an important part of the Korean Armistice Agreement. The legal basis of this work is the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visitation Work" formulated in accordance with the "Terms of Reference," the purpose of which is to ensure the repatriation rights of prisoners of war, thereby ensuring the stable implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement. Whether the prisoner of war explanation work can proceed smoothly is obviously not only related to the vital interests of the prisoners of war not directly repatriated by the opposing sides in Korea, but is also an important indicator of whether the Korean Armistice Agreement is thoroughly observed.

    However, the current prisoner of war explanation work, although the United Nations Command's prisoner of war explanation work has been able to proceed smoothly due to our side's compliance with the "Terms of Reference" and the provision of isolation facilities in accordance with the provisions of the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visitation Work," isolating prisoners of war who have and have not listened to the explanations; our side's explanation work has been completely stalled due to the U.S. side's instigation of Li-Chiang special agents to carry out frantic sabotage. According to the provisions of the "Terms of Reference," the explanation period for prisoners of war not directly repatriated was originally set at ninety days, and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visitation Work" also stipulated that "each prisoner of war should attend the explanation and visitation." However, the U.S. side initially delayed the start of the explanation work, then instigated special agents to use force to prevent our captured personnel from listening to the explanations, and recently U.S. special agents even refused to isolate prisoners of war who had and had not listened to the explanations in accordance with the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visitation Work," so that our side's explanation work has been forced to stop five times since it began on October 15th. Our side's explanation work has only been carried out for a total of seven days so far, and 90 percent of our captured personnel have not yet heard the explanations. The U.S. side must bear full responsibility for this serious sabotage of our side's explanation work.

    The U.S. side's shameful acts of sabotaging the prisoner of war explanation work have long been thoroughly exposed due to the U.S. special agents' rampant lawlessness, murder, and heart-gouging atrocities in the prisoner of war camps, which are known to all in the world. Recently, the secret orders of the special agents intercepted by the Indian custodial forces have completely confirmed the U.S. side's sabotage activities. This secret order not only proves that the prisoner of war camps guarding our captured personnel are completely under the violent control of U.S. special agents, but also proves that all the crimes of the Li-Chiang special agents mixed in the prisoner of war camps in sabotaging the explanation work and killing prisoners of war who wished to be repatriated were carried out under the direct command of the U.S. side. At the same time, this secret order further proves that the U.S. side's purpose in sabotaging the explanation work is to attempt to realize its consistent conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war. This despicable and shameless practice of the U.S. side is absolutely intolerable to anyone with a sense of justice and conscience.

    However, the U.S. side is still not satisfied with this. In order to coordinate with the conspiracy to sabotage the explanation work and forcibly detain prisoners of war, it has also adopted a shameless delaying policy in the bilateral talks on the political conference. Even when starting to discuss the agenda of the bilateral talks, the U.S. side absurdly opposed including the issue of membership, which is crucial to the success or failure of the political conference, on the agenda, causing the time of the bilateral talks to be wasted for eighteen days in vain. It was only because the U.S. side's unreasonable demands were condemned by the world and our side made unremitting efforts that the U.S. side was forced to enter into formal discussions with our side on issues such as the membership, location, and time of the political conference after November 17th. But subsequent facts have still proved that the U.S. side has absolutely no sincerity in discussing these practical issues. U.S. representative Dean openly said that he was prepared for "long-term haggling." On the issue of neutral countries participating in the political conference, the U.S. side unreasonably opposed our side's reasonable proposal to invite five neutral countries, namely the Soviet Union, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Burma, to participate in the political conference. Dean stubbornly insisted that the Soviet Union was not a neutral country and made despicable slanders against the Soviet Union. Dean also fabricated a series of excuses to oppose other neutral countries participating in the political conference. He actually despised the status of neutral countries, saying that they were "newly established countries" and "unable to take care of themselves," and even compared them with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the political ghost of Taiwan supported by the United States. On the issue of the powers of neutral countries in the political conference, Dean put forward various restrictions, attempting to make the neutral countries unable to do anything once they participated in the political conference. A report by the United States Associated Press on December 1 admitted: Dean wanted the neutral countries to "sit aside and only speak when asked to speak." This domineering and absurd attitude of the United States cannot but arouse the indignation of the Asian people and the countries concerned.

    On the issue of the location of the political conference, Dean dared to casually propose more than a dozen place names, including cities in South America and Africa, as well as Madrid, Spain, under Franco, which was obviously extremely rogue-like. On the issue of time, Dean sometimes demanded a fixed date, and sometimes demanded no specific date. On November 16, he hypocritically advocated December 15 as the date of the meeting, but then attempted to postpone the meeting date indefinitely. On the issue of the agenda of the political conference, Dean even absurdly used some kind of relativity to oppose discussing "other relevant issues." In this way, all important issues in the bilateral talks have not been seriously discussed. In addition, the U.S. representative often avoided the main topic, rambling on nonsense, and deliberately distorted our side's clear suggestions in order to create extraneous issues and cause endless disputes, making it impossible for the bilateral meeting to achieve any results.

    In order to pave the way for the convening of the political conference, our side put forward comprehensive, fair, and reasonable proposals in the bilateral talks on October 30. This proposal has been welcomed by world opinion, but the U.S. side has not shown any sincerity in seriously discussing our side's proposal to this day. What does this prove? Obviously, this can only prove that the U.S. side is adhering to its delaying policy in the bilateral talks on the political conference in order to achieve its sinister purpose of forcibly detaining prisoners of war. Dean had already claimed on December 4 that "the prisoners of war will be 'freed' on January 22, regardless of whether the political conference is being held at that time." "Well-informed sources" in Seoul also said that the U.S. delegation was "settled in for a long stay in Korea." The United States is obviously plotting to drag the bilateral talks past the U.S. side's so-called prisoner of war detention deadline of January 22 next year, in order to facilitate its forcible detention of more than 20,000 Korean and Chinese captured personnel who have not yet heard the explanations. At the same time, the United States is using the fact that the bilateral talks that it is desperately delaying have not yet ended as an excuse to oppose the United Nations discussing the Korean issue. The United States obviously wants to continue to entangle the Korean issue as an important means for it to maintain tension in the Far East and the world and to conduct the "Cold War." For this shameful purpose, it does not hesitate to aggravate the unstable situation after the Korean Armistice.

    The United Nations, which willingly succumbs to the U.S. government, is to blame for this serious situation. Originally, the purpose of the United Nations Charter is to maintain international peace and security. However, when the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly was held, it was precisely the time when the U.S. government was wantonly sabotaging the explanation work and delaying the bilateral talks. The United Nations General Assembly willingly abandoned its responsibilities, and did not discuss the Korean issue, which is so important to peace in the Far East and peace in the world. It did not condemn the countless crimes of the United States in torturing and killing prisoners of war and civilians and conducting bacteriological warfare; it turned a blind eye to the U.S. government's various conspiracies to forcibly detain prisoners of war and obstruct the convening of the political conference; on the contrary, the United Nations General Assembly obeyed the U.S. government's policy of creating international tension, and in the absence of the Korean and Chinese sides, arbitrarily slandered and defamed the Korean and Chinese people, and actually passed the so-called "Five-Nation Proposal" jointly put forward by the U.S. government coercing its vassal states such as Britain, France, Australia, and Turkey. This illegal action of the United Nations General Assembly will only further condone the unbridled behavior of the United States, and is completely unhelpful and harmful to further easing international tension.

    The notice issued by Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai to the United Nations General Assembly concentratedly exposed the U.S. government's conspiracy to create a serious situation in Korea, which is undoubtedly another serious test for the United Nations General Assembly. Now the people of the world are watching what attitude the United Nations General Assembly will take.

### 目前朝鲜的严重局势

    目前朝鲜的严重局势
    目前朝鲜的局势，已因美方以特务政策破坏朝中方面对战俘的解释工作，并以拖延政策使政治会议问题的会谈陷于僵局，而趋于严重化了。十二月七日，我国周恩来外长经由联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德先生、联合国大会主席潘迪特夫人向联合国大会发出通知，概括地指出了这一严重局势。周外长在通知中说：“朝鲜当前的严重局势，完全是美国政府企图破坏朝鲜停战协定、强迫扣留战俘、阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题以便继续保持国际紧张局势的罪恶政策所造成的。这种局势不仅使世界人民要求和平解决朝鲜问题的渴望受到了打击，而且正酝酿着严重的后果。”对于朝鲜问题的这种严重局势，联合国大会应该予以严重注意。全世界一切愿望朝鲜问题和平解决、缓和世界紧张局势的各国政府和人民也应该予以严重注视，并一致起来制止美国政府的罪恶阴谋。
    美国政府指使李蒋特务破坏朝中方面对战俘的解释工作，使中立国遣返委员会的“职权范围”无法实施，这是造成目前朝鲜严重局势的重要原因。对不直接遣返的战俘的解释工作，是朝鲜停战协定的重要部分。这一工作的法律根据是“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”及按照“职权范围”而制订的“解释和访问工作细则”，其目的是保障战俘的遣返权利，从而使朝鲜停战协定得到稳定的实施。战俘解释工作能否顺利进行，显然不但关系到朝鲜敌对双方不直接遣返的战俘的切身利益，而且也是朝鲜停战协定是否得到彻底遵守的重要标志。
    然而，当前战俘解释工作，虽然由于我方遵守“职权范围”，并按照“解释和访问工作细则”的规定提供了隔离设备，隔离了已听解释和未听解释的战俘，而使联合国军方面的战俘解释工作得以顺利进行；但是我方的解释工作，却由于美方指使李蒋特务进行疯狂破坏而完全陷于停顿。根据“职权范围”的规定，对不直接遣返的战俘的解释期限原定九十天，“解释和访问工作细则”并规定“每一战俘应出席解释与访问”。但是，美方初则拖延解释工作的开始，继则指使特务以武力阻止我方被俘人员听取解释，最近美方特务更不许按照“解释和访问工作细则”来隔离已听解释和未听解释的战俘，以至我方解释工作自十月十五日开始进行以来，已五次被迫停顿。我方的解释工作迄今一共才进行了七天，有百分之九十的我方被俘人员还没有听到解释。我方解释工作所遭到的这种严重的破坏，美方必须负担完全的责任。
    美方破坏战俘解释工作的可耻行为，早已由于美方特务在战俘营中横行不法、杀人、挖心的暴行而彻底暴露，为天下人所共见。最近，印度看管部队所截获的特务密令，更完全地证实了美方的破坏行为。这个密令不但证明了看管我方被俘人员的战俘营完全是在美方特务的暴力控制之下，而且还证明了混在战俘营中的李蒋特务的一切破坏解释工作和残杀有遣返愿望战俘的罪行都是在美方的直接指挥下干出来的。同时，这个密令更证明了美方破坏解释工作的目的，是企图借此实现其强迫扣留战俘的一贯阴谋。美方的这种卑劣无耻的作法，是任何有正义感和良心的人都绝对不能容忍的。
    可是，美国方面仍不以此为满足，它为了配合破坏解释工作、强迫扣留战俘的阴谋计划，在关于政治会议的双方会谈中，也一直采取了无耻的拖延政策。还在开始商讨双方会谈的议程问题时，美方就荒谬绝伦地反对把政治会议成败所系的成员问题列入议程，致使双方会谈的时间白白地消磨了十八天。只是由于美方的无理主张遭到全世界的斥责，和我方做了坚持不懈的努力，才迫使美方在十一月十七日以后，开始与我方进入了关于政治会议的成员、地点和时间等问题的正式讨论。但是后来的事实仍然证明了美方是完全没有诚意讨论这些实际问题的。美方代表迪安公开说他准备“长期的讨价还价”。在中立国参加政治会议的问题上，美方毫无道理地反对我方关于邀请苏联、印度、印度尼西亚、巴基斯坦和缅甸五个中立国家参加政治会议的合理主张。迪安硬说苏联不是中立国，并对苏联进行卑鄙的污蔑。迪安还制造了一连串借口，反对其他中立国参加政治会议，他居然藐视中立国家的地位，说它们“立国较晚”，“自顾不暇”，甚至把它们和美国所支持的台湾政治幽灵蒋匪帮相提并论。在关于中立国在政治会议中的权限问题上，迪安提出了种种限制，企图使中立国一旦参加政治会议，也将陷于丝毫不能有所作为的地步。十二月一日美国合众社的报道承认：迪安是要中立国“静坐一旁，等到叫它说话的时候才起来说话”。美国这种专横和荒唐的态度，不能不引起亚洲人民及有关国家愤慨。
    关于政治会议的地点问题，迪安竟敢顺口提出了一打以上的地名，其中包括南美洲和非洲的城市以及佛朗哥西班牙的马德里，显然是无赖已极。在时间问题上，迪安一会儿要求规定一个固定的日期，一会儿又要求不要具体日期，十一月十六日他假惺惺地主张十二月十五日作为开会日期，接着却又企图把会议日期拖到无限期。在政治会议议程问题上，迪安更荒谬地用什么相对论来反对讨论“其他有关问题”。这样，在双方会谈中的所有重要问题，迄未得到认真的讨论。加上美方代表经常避开正题不谈，漫无边际地胡扯废话，并故意歪曲我方的明确建议，以便节外生枝，引起无止境的争论，使双方会议不可能得到什么结果。
    我方为了给政治会议的召开铺平道路，在双方十月三十日的会谈中，提出了全面的公正合理的建议。这个建议已经获得全世界舆论的欢迎，但是美方直到今天仍然没有表现出任何认真讨论我方建议的诚意。这证明什么呢？显然，这只能证明美方对于政治会议的双方会谈，正在坚持它的拖延政策，以便它达到强迫扣留战俘的罪恶目的。迪安在十二月四日就已声称，“战俘将在一月二十二日获得‘自由’，不管政治会议到那时是否已在举行”。汉城的“消息灵通人士”也说，美国代表团已经 “安心于长期逗留在朝鲜了”。美国显然是阴谋把双方会谈拖过明年一月二十二日美方所谓的战俘拘留期限，以便于它强迫扣留二万多名尚未听取解释的朝中被俘人员。同时，美国又以它所拚命拖延的双方会谈尚未结束为借口，来反对联合国讨论朝鲜问题。美国显然要把朝鲜问题继续纠缠下去，作为它保持远东和世界的紧张局势和进行“冷战”的一个重要手段。为了这个可耻的目的，它竟不惜使朝鲜停战后不稳定的局势严重化起来。
    对于这种严重的局势，甘心屈从美国政府的联合国是难辞其咎的。本来，联合国宪章的宗旨是维护国际和平与安全的。可是，当第八届联合国大会开会期间，正是美国政府放肆地破坏解释工作、拖延双方会谈的时候，联合国大会自甘放弃职责，根本不讨论关系远东和平与世界和平如此重大的朝鲜问题，对于美国罄竹难书的虐杀战俘和平民及进行细菌战等罪行，竟然毫不加以谴责；对于美国政府强迫扣留战俘，阻挠政治会议召开的种种阴谋，竟然熟视无睹；相反地，联合国大会却听命于美国政府制造国际紧张局势的政策，在没有朝中方面参加的情况下，对朝中人民任意污蔑诽谤，居然通过了美国政府胁迫英国、法国、澳大利亚、土耳其等仆从国家联合提出的所谓“五国提案”。联合国大会的这种非法行动，只会更加纵容美国横行无忌，对于进一步缓和国际紧张局势是完全无益而有害的。
    我国周恩来外长向联合国大会发出的这个通知，集中地揭露了美国政府制造朝鲜严重局势的阴谋，这对于联合国大会无疑地是又一次严重的考验。现在全世界人民都要看联合国大会究竟采取什么态度了。
