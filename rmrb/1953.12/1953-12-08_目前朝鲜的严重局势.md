    The current situation in Korea has become serious due to the U.S. side's use of espionage tactics to sabotage the explanation work to prisoners of war by the Korean and Chinese side, and its use of delaying tactics to bring the political conference talks to a standstill. On December 7th, Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, through United Nations Secretary-General Dag Hammarskj√∂ld and United Nations General Assembly President Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, sent a notice to the United Nations General Assembly, outlining this serious situation. Foreign Minister Zhou said in the notice: "The current serious situation in Korea is entirely caused by the U.S. government's sinister policy of attempting to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement, forcibly detain prisoners of war, and obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue in order to continue maintaining international tension. This situation has not only dealt a blow to the world's people's desire for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, but is also brewing serious consequences." The United Nations General Assembly should pay serious attention to this serious situation in the Korean issue. All governments and people of all countries who desire a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the easing of world tensions should also pay serious attention and unite to stop the U.S. government's sinister conspiracies.

    The U.S. government's instigation of the Li-Chiang special agents to sabotage the Korean and Chinese side's explanation work to prisoners of war, making it impossible to implement the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's "Terms of Reference," is an important reason for the current serious situation in Korea. The explanation work for prisoners of war not directly repatriated is an important part of the Korean Armistice Agreement. The legal basis of this work is the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visitation Work" formulated in accordance with the "Terms of Reference," the purpose of which is to ensure the repatriation rights of prisoners of war, thereby ensuring the stable implementation of the Korean Armistice Agreement. Whether the prisoner of war explanation work can proceed smoothly is obviously not only related to the vital interests of the prisoners of war not directly repatriated by the opposing sides in Korea, but is also an important indicator of whether the Korean Armistice Agreement is thoroughly observed.

    However, the current prisoner of war explanation work, although the United Nations Command's prisoner of war explanation work has been able to proceed smoothly due to our side's compliance with the "Terms of Reference" and the provision of isolation facilities in accordance with the provisions of the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visitation Work," isolating prisoners of war who have and have not listened to the explanations; our side's explanation work has been completely stalled due to the U.S. side's instigation of Li-Chiang special agents to carry out frantic sabotage. According to the provisions of the "Terms of Reference," the explanation period for prisoners of war not directly repatriated was originally set at ninety days, and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visitation Work" also stipulated that "each prisoner of war should attend the explanation and visitation." However, the U.S. side initially delayed the start of the explanation work, then instigated special agents to use force to prevent our captured personnel from listening to the explanations, and recently U.S. special agents even refused to isolate prisoners of war who had and had not listened to the explanations in accordance with the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visitation Work," so that our side's explanation work has been forced to stop five times since it began on October 15th. Our side's explanation work has only been carried out for a total of seven days so far, and 90 percent of our captured personnel have not yet heard the explanations. The U.S. side must bear full responsibility for this serious sabotage of our side's explanation work.

    The U.S. side's shameful acts of sabotaging the prisoner of war explanation work have long been thoroughly exposed due to the U.S. special agents' rampant lawlessness, murder, and heart-gouging atrocities in the prisoner of war camps, which are known to all in the world. Recently, the secret orders of the special agents intercepted by the Indian custodial forces have completely confirmed the U.S. side's sabotage activities. This secret order not only proves that the prisoner of war camps guarding our captured personnel are completely under the violent control of U.S. special agents, but also proves that all the crimes of the Li-Chiang special agents mixed in the prisoner of war camps in sabotaging the explanation work and killing prisoners of war who wished to be repatriated were carried out under the direct command of the U.S. side. At the same time, this secret order further proves that the U.S. side's purpose in sabotaging the explanation work is to attempt to realize its consistent conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war. This despicable and shameless practice of the U.S. side is absolutely intolerable to anyone with a sense of justice and conscience.

    However, the U.S. side is still not satisfied with this. In order to coordinate with the conspiracy to sabotage the explanation work and forcibly detain prisoners of war, it has also adopted a shameless delaying policy in the bilateral talks on the political conference. Even when starting to discuss the agenda of the bilateral talks, the U.S. side absurdly opposed including the issue of membership, which is crucial to the success or failure of the political conference, on the agenda, causing the time of the bilateral talks to be wasted for eighteen days in vain. It was only because the U.S. side's unreasonable demands were condemned by the world and our side made unremitting efforts that the U.S. side was forced to enter into formal discussions with our side on issues such as the membership, location, and time of the political conference after November 17th. But subsequent facts have still proved that the U.S. side has absolutely no sincerity in discussing these practical issues. U.S. representative Dean openly said that he was prepared for "long-term haggling." On the issue of neutral countries participating in the political conference, the U.S. side unreasonably opposed our side's reasonable proposal to invite five neutral countries, namely the Soviet Union, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Burma, to participate in the political conference. Dean stubbornly insisted that the Soviet Union was not a neutral country and made despicable slanders against the Soviet Union. Dean also fabricated a series of excuses to oppose other neutral countries participating in the political conference. He actually despised the status of neutral countries, saying that they were "newly established countries" and "unable to take care of themselves," and even compared them with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the political ghost of Taiwan supported by the United States. On the issue of the powers of neutral countries in the political conference, Dean put forward various restrictions, attempting to make the neutral countries unable to do anything once they participated in the political conference. A report by the United States Associated Press on December 1 admitted: Dean wanted the neutral countries to "sit aside and only speak when asked to speak." This domineering and absurd attitude of the United States cannot but arouse the indignation of the Asian people and the countries concerned.

    On the issue of the location of the political conference, Dean dared to casually propose more than a dozen place names, including cities in South America and Africa, as well as Madrid, Spain, under Franco, which was obviously extremely rogue-like. On the issue of time, Dean sometimes demanded a fixed date, and sometimes demanded no specific date. On November 16, he hypocritically advocated December 15 as the date of the meeting, but then attempted to postpone the meeting date indefinitely. On the issue of the agenda of the political conference, Dean even absurdly used some kind of relativity to oppose discussing "other relevant issues." In this way, all important issues in the bilateral talks have not been seriously discussed. In addition, the U.S. representative often avoided the main topic, rambling on nonsense, and deliberately distorted our side's clear suggestions in order to create extraneous issues and cause endless disputes, making it impossible for the bilateral meeting to achieve any results.

    In order to pave the way for the convening of the political conference, our side put forward comprehensive, fair, and reasonable proposals in the bilateral talks on October 30. This proposal has been welcomed by world opinion, but the U.S. side has not shown any sincerity in seriously discussing our side's proposal to this day. What does this prove? Obviously, this can only prove that the U.S. side is adhering to its delaying policy in the bilateral talks on the political conference in order to achieve its sinister purpose of forcibly detaining prisoners of war. Dean had already claimed on December 4 that "the prisoners of war will be 'freed' on January 22, regardless of whether the political conference is being held at that time." "Well-informed sources" in Seoul also said that the U.S. delegation was "settled in for a long stay in Korea." The United States is obviously plotting to drag the bilateral talks past the U.S. side's so-called prisoner of war detention deadline of January 22 next year, in order to facilitate its forcible detention of more than 20,000 Korean and Chinese captured personnel who have not yet heard the explanations. At the same time, the United States is using the fact that the bilateral talks that it is desperately delaying have not yet ended as an excuse to oppose the United Nations discussing the Korean issue. The United States obviously wants to continue to entangle the Korean issue as an important means for it to maintain tension in the Far East and the world and to conduct the "Cold War." For this shameful purpose, it does not hesitate to aggravate the unstable situation after the Korean Armistice.

    The United Nations, which willingly succumbs to the U.S. government, is to blame for this serious situation. Originally, the purpose of the United Nations Charter is to maintain international peace and security. However, when the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly was held, it was precisely the time when the U.S. government was wantonly sabotaging the explanation work and delaying the bilateral talks. The United Nations General Assembly willingly abandoned its responsibilities, and did not discuss the Korean issue, which is so important to peace in the Far East and peace in the world. It did not condemn the countless crimes of the United States in torturing and killing prisoners of war and civilians and conducting bacteriological warfare; it turned a blind eye to the U.S. government's various conspiracies to forcibly detain prisoners of war and obstruct the convening of the political conference; on the contrary, the United Nations General Assembly obeyed the U.S. government's policy of creating international tension, and in the absence of the Korean and Chinese sides, arbitrarily slandered and defamed the Korean and Chinese people, and actually passed the so-called "Five-Nation Proposal" jointly put forward by the U.S. government coercing its vassal states such as Britain, France, Australia, and Turkey. This illegal action of the United Nations General Assembly will only further condone the unbridled behavior of the United States, and is completely unhelpful and harmful to further easing international tension.

    The notice issued by Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai to the United Nations General Assembly concentratedly exposed the U.S. government's conspiracy to create a serious situation in Korea, which is undoubtedly another serious test for the United Nations General Assembly. Now the people of the world are watching what attitude the United Nations General Assembly will take.
