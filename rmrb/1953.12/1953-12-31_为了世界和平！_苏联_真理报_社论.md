    For World Peace!
    ——Pravda Editorial
      The year 1953 is about to pass. The new year 1954 is about to arrive. In these days, millions upon millions of men and women are looking back at the past year of 1953 and looking forward to the future with keen eyes. Good people, those who dedicate all their energy to the sacred cause of defending peace and preventing new threats of bloodshed, are greeting the New Year with vigor and confidence. They have every right to say: Yes, in the past year, the struggle for peace has made considerable achievements. Millions upon millions of men and women, young and old, bravely and loudly called out against the policies of war and aggression. Their efforts have not been in vain, even though they often sacrificed their positions and the happiness of their families, and in many cases even their lives. The self-sacrificing struggles of these ordinary, often nameless heroes have produced remarkable results: the cause of peace is constantly being consolidated. The great army of international peace defenders is growing year by year and becoming stronger in the struggle against the dark forces of war and aggression.
    The world people's movement to defend peace is the youngest movement in history. This movement was only born four years ago, but in this short period, it has grown into a powerful and truly invincible force!
    At first, the instigators of war and their paid propagandists despised the peace movement and tried to turn a deaf ear to it and ignore it. Later, they resorted to vicious slander against peace advocates, persecuting them with batons and courts. But this did not help the enemies of peace. They now watch with greater fear, panic, and bewilderment as the world peace movement, sweeping across countries and continents, becomes an impregnable fortress, blocking the evil path of the enemies of peace.
    The strength and invincibility of this movement lies in the fact that it is a movement of the broadest masses of the people, representing not the interests of a particular party or organization, but the interests of hundreds of millions of people around the world. It is a true people's movement, a movement of those who create history. Precisely because of this, no matter how rampant the reactionary and dark forces may be, the international peace front continues to expand and consolidate. This was particularly evident in 1953. This year, the peace movement has expanded more deeply and widely. The noble idea of fighting for peace is becoming more and more popular. Groups and strata that had previously stood by are now actively involved in the struggle to prevent the threat of war. The number of political and social figures from Western and Eastern countries joining the ranks of peace advocates is increasing year by year. The growing world peace movement has forced the enemies of peace to take a defensive position and retreat in the face of the pressure of the forces of peace.
    For more than three years, the forces of war have been obstructing the cessation of the bloodshed they initiated in Korea. However, they were finally forced to retreat. The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement was a great victory for peace-loving countries and people in 1953. The policy of aggression and the adventurous "policy of strength" suffered an extremely serious defeat. The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement clearly demonstrated that the position of those peace-loving countries and people is extremely correct, and these countries and people affirm that all international issues can and should be resolved not by a "policy of strength," but on the basis of reaching mutually acceptable agreements and understandings.
    The cannons on the Korean land have ceased their death-bringing roars. However, the enemies of peace have by no means laid down their weapons. On the contrary, they are carrying out subversive activities more fanatically to undermine the peace and security of all nations. All honest people are indignant at the news that the US representative withdrew from the Panmunjom talks. They rightly believe that this action once again proves that the US aggressive bloc does not want a complete and peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.
    What else can be achieved by the Washington authorities' efforts to maintain the position of the Kuomintang remnants in the United Nations while obstructing the participation of the only legitimate representative of the Chinese people—the government of the People's Republic of China—in the United Nations, other than to arouse the deep indignation of the people of the world?
    People of all countries see that the forces hostile to peace are attempting to expand the war in Indochina; they are disregarding the will of the Asian people and want to turn Pakistan into a springboard for new war adventures; they are pushing Japan onto the path of militaristic death.
    The extremely dangerous activities of the war-mongers in Germany have not stopped. They are intent on accelerating the fostering of aggressive and revanchist forces in West Germany, arming these forces, thereby pushing the German people, along with the people of other European countries, back into the abyss of war.
    In view of the growing resistance of the people of France and other European countries to this sinister policy, the ruling circles in the United States are presumptuously trampling on the rights and interests of France, attempting to turn it into a powerless province of a Germanized "European Federation."
    Western politicians use words full of peace to cover up their actions hostile to peace and international security. These people no longer dare to openly oppose the wishes of peace-loving people, so they have to talk about "peace" to cover up the aggressive policies they are pursuing.
    Peace defenders vigilantly watch the various conspiracies and traps of the enemies of peace, and expose them without fear.
    The foreign policy pursued by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government has won the infinite love and gratitude of all honest people in the world, because this policy aims to maintain peace, ease international tensions, and consolidate and develop friendly relations between all peoples and all countries.
    The Soviet government issued a statement on US President Eisenhower's speech on December 8, 1953. The proposals put forward by the Soviet government in this important statement have received enthusiastic support from all peace-loving people around the world. As everyone knows, the Soviet government proposed to conclude an international agreement prohibiting the use of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction. Peace-loving people in all countries rightly believe that this new proposal of the Soviet government is another major contribution to the cause of striving for a solid and lasting peace and freeing mankind from the disasters of murderous atomic and hydrogen weapons.
    Fighting for peace side by side with the powerful, peace-loving Soviet Union are the people's democratic countries of Europe and Asia. The People's Republic of China has become a powerful force in the camp of peace and democracy. The people's democratic countries of Europe are becoming stronger year by year, becoming reliable defenders of world peace. The camp of international peace defenders is strong. It is fully capable of defending and consolidating the cause of world peace. The countless ranks of peace defenders in all countries have gained new strength from the awareness of this, and all good people are full of enthusiasm to fight with greater perseverance and greater strength to stop the threat of new wars and to protect the security of all nations.
    Today, "Pravda" publishes New Year's talks by famous social figures and peace fighters from various countries. The will that runs through the talks of these people is: the cause of peace is growing stronger day by day, and the people of all countries are full of infinite confidence in stopping the insidious plans of the enemies of mankind—the culprits of new wars.
    On the eve of the New Year, the Soviet people, loyal to the cause of peace, extend warm congratulations to the good people of all countries, to our comrades-in-arms in the struggle for peace and friendship among all peoples, and wish them new victories in the great and noble struggle.

### 为了世界和平！——苏联“真理报”社论

    为了世界和平！
    ——苏联“真理报”社论
      一九五三年就要过去了。新的一九五四年就要来到了。在这些日子里，千千万万的男女都在回顾过去的一九五三年，并以锐敏的眼光瞻望着将来。善良的人们、把自己的全部精力贡献给神圣的保卫和平事业、防止新的流血威胁的人们，都在生气勃勃和满怀信心地迎接新年。他们有充分的权利说：是的，过去一年中，争取和平的斗争有了相当大的成就。千千万万的男女老少英勇地大声疾呼反对战争和侵略政策，他们常常因此而牺牲自己的地位和自己家庭的幸福，在许多场合下甚至牺牲自己的性命，他们的努力并没有白费。这些平凡的、往往是无名的英雄的自我牺牲的斗争已卓著成果：和平事业在不断地巩固着。国际和平捍卫者的大军在反对战争和侵略的黑暗势力的斗争中一年年地壮大，一年年地锻炼坚强了。
    世界人民保卫和平的运动是历史上最年青的运动。这个运动的诞生只不过四年，然而，它在这段短短的时期中就已成长为一种壮大的、真正不可战胜的力量了！
    起先，战争的挑拨者和他们的御用鼓吹者曾经轻视和平运动，想对它充耳不闻，置之不理。后来，他们又对和平拥护者进行恶毒的诬蔑，用警棍和法庭来迫害和平拥护者。但是，这对和平的敌人没有什么帮助。他们现在以更加恐惧、惊慌和困惑不解的心情注视着：席卷各国、各洲的世界和平运动是如何成为坚不可摧的堡垒，阻挡着和平敌人的罪恶的道路。
    这个运动的力量和不可战胜性在于：这是一个最广泛的人民群众的运动，它所代表的不是某一个党派或组织的利益，而是世界各地亿万人民的利益。这是真正的人民运动，是那些创造历史的人们的运动。正因为如此，尽管反动势力和黑暗势力是如何猖狂，国际的和平阵线不断地扩展，不断地巩固。一九五三年特别明显地证明了这一点。今年，和平运动扩展得更为深入更为广泛了。为和平而斗争的崇高思想越来越普及了。那些不久以前还在袖手旁观的集团和阶层，也投入了防止战争威胁的积极斗争中。西方和东方各国的各种政治人物和社会人物加入和平拥护者行列的一年比一年增加。壮大的世界和平运动使和平的敌人不得不采取守势，不得不在和平力量的压力面前退却。
    三年多来，战争力量一直阻挠停止它们所发动的朝鲜流血。然而，它们终于被迫退却了。朝鲜停战协定的签订是爱好和平的国家和人民在一九五三年所获得的伟大的胜利。侵略政策和冒险的“实力政策”遭到了极其严重的失败。朝鲜停战协定的签订明显地证明了那些爱好和平的国家和人民的立场是极端正确的，这些国家和人民肯定：一切国际问题是可以而且应该不是用“实力政策”、而是在达成大家都能接受的协议和协定的基础上解决的。
    朝鲜土地的大炮已经停止了带来死亡的狂吼。然而和平的敌人绝没有放下他们的武器。相反，他们更加狂热地进行颠覆活动来破坏各国人民的和平与安全。一切正直的人们闻悉美国代表退出板门店谈判的消息，莫不愤慨，他们公正地认为，这个行动再一次证明了美国侵略集团不想彻底和平解决朝鲜问题。
    华盛顿某些人士竭力维持国民党残余在联合国的地位，而阻挠中国人民唯一合法的代表——中华人民共和国政府参加联合国，这一行动，除了引起世界人民的深刻的公愤之外，还有什么结果呢？
    各国人民都看到：与和平为敌的势力企图扩大印度支那战争；他们置亚洲人民的意志于不顾，想把巴基斯坦变为新战争冒险的跳板，他们正在把日本推上军国主义的死亡道路。
    战争贩子在德国的极其危险的勾当还没有停止。他们居心要加速扶植西德的侵略和复仇势力，给这些势力以武器，从而把德国人民、连带欧洲各国人民一起重新推入战争的深渊。
    美国统治集团鉴于法国及欧洲其他国家的人民日益反抗这个罪恶的政策，竟喧宾夺主地蹂躏法国的权利和利益，企图把它变成德国化的“欧洲联邦”的一个毫无权利的省份。
    西方国家的政治家用满口和平的词句来掩饰他们敌对和平与国际安全的行动。这些人士已不敢公然反对爱好和平的人民的愿望，于是不得不侈谈“和平”以遮掩他们执行的侵略政策。
    和平保卫者警惕地注视着和平敌人的各种阴谋圈套，毫不畏惧地揭穿它们。
    苏联共产党和苏联政府执行的外交政策赢得了世界一切正直人们的无限爱戴与感激，因为这个政策以维护和平，缓和国际紧张局势，巩固和发展各国人民和各国之间的友好联系为目的。
    苏联政府曾就美国总统艾森豪威尔一九五三年十二月八日的演说发表了一个声明，苏联政府在这个著名的声明中所提出的建议，得到了全人类爱好和平的人们的热烈支持。大家知道，苏联政府建议缔结一个禁止使用原子武器、氢武器及其他大规模毁灭性的武器的国际协定。各国爱好和平的人们都公正地认为，苏联政府的这一新建议，对于争取巩固的、持久的和平的事业，在使人类免受杀人的原子武器和氢武器的灾难方面，又是一个重大的贡献。
    与强大的、爱好和平的苏联并肩为和平而斗争的有欧洲的和亚洲的各人民民主国家。中华人民共和国已成为和平与民主阵营中的一支强大力量。欧洲的人民民主国家一年比一年强大，成为世界和平的可靠的捍卫者。国际和平保卫者的阵营是强大的。它完全有力量来捍卫和巩固世界和平的事业。所有国家的无数和平保卫者的队伍因为意识到这一点而获得了新的力量，所有善良的人们因为意识到这一点而满腔热情地以更加坚忍不拔的精神，以更加巨大的力量为制止新战争的威胁，为保卫各国人民的安全而斗争。
    今天“真理报”发表了各国的著名社会人士、和平战士的新年谈话。在这些人士的谈话中贯穿着一个意志，就是：和平事业在日益壮大，各国人民充满着无限的信心，制止人类的敌人——新战争的祸首实现他们的阴险的计划。
    值此新年前夕，矢忠于和平事业的苏联人民，向一切国家的善良的人们，向在争取和平与各国人民的友谊的斗争中的战友们，致以热烈的祝贺，并祝他们在伟大的、崇高的斗争中取得新的胜利。
