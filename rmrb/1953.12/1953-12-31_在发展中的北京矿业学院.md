    The Developing Beijing Mining Institute
    Li Huangguo
    Beijing Mining Institute (formerly known as the China Institute of Mining) was established in 1950 on the basis of the former Jiaozuo Institute of Technology. It is a higher industrial school for training technical cadres for the coal mining industry.

    In the past three years, the school has greatly developed. The number of students has increased from the initial 200 to more than 1,900; the number of teachers has also increased from 50 to 317. Currently, Beijing Mining Institute has five departments and seven majors. In addition, thirteen laboratories have been established, including general electrical engineering, coal preparation, metallographic heat treatment, and mining machinery (nine laboratories, including physical chemistry, mining electrical engineering, mining equipment, and coal quality analysis, will be completed soon).

    The school has vigorously cultivated teachers. On the one hand, it improves the level of old teachers, and on the other hand, it trains new teachers in a planned manner. In 1952, Soviet coal mining expert Professor Kiriyechkov and mining electrical engineering expert Professor Smirnov came to the school one after another (recently, Soviet mine surveying expert Gordeyko also came to the school). They played a significant role in all aspects of the school's work, especially in improving the professional level of teachers. Soviet experts opened two courses for teachers: coal mining methods and mining electrical engineering. At the same time, they personally trained teachers to enable them to open courses. Now, with the help of Soviet experts, teacher Guo Tai has begun to teach coal mining methods, teacher Ma Qi teaches mining electrical engineering, and teacher Wu Zhenchun teaches general electrical engineering. The school also adopted the method of teachers' "technical business trips" so that teachers can go to factories and mines to specifically study certain problems, enrich teaching content, and solve certain production technical problems on site. For example, lecturer Li Dixun of the tunneling engineering teaching and research group conducted drilling and blasting tests at the Fuxin Coal Mine in Northeast China this summer based on Soviet experience (which is the most important part of tunnel excavation), which increased the efficiency of chisel use by 7.8 times and the excavation speed by 50 percent.

    The work of the teaching and research group has been improved and enhanced. Before 1952, due to the lack of experience in leading the activities of the teaching and research group on the part of the leadership, and the lack of sufficient understanding of teaching research on the part of the teachers, some teaching and research groups actually had no activities. Under the leadership of the Central Ministry of Higher Education and with the help of Soviet experts, and through the continuous efforts of all teachers, the work of the teaching and research group has gradually improved. Soviet expert Kiriyechkov gave a report to all teachers on the activities of the teaching and research group and personally participated in the work of the teaching and research group. At present, all 26 teaching and research groups have regular activities, and can initially carry out criticism and self-criticism. In particular, the teaching and research group has played a certain role in helping teachers who open courses improve their teaching quality and cultivate teachers. At present, 37 teaching assistants have opened courses successively. Their teaching effects are generally good. This ensures the smooth completion of the teaching plan. In a recent teaching inspection, each teaching and research group carefully examined the strengths and weaknesses of the work and proposed ways to improve the work. Teachers of the geology teaching and research group strengthened unity, overcame the emotions of demanding too much too quickly, and strengthened trial lectures. Other teaching and research groups have also achieved the same results. After the National Higher Industrial School Administrative Conference, each teaching and research group formulated a more specific and detailed work plan, and strengthened the leadership of teaching research. Teachers have also studied Soviet textbooks and generally adopted Soviet textbooks, or compiled lecture notes based on Soviet textbooks.

    The idea of loving the motherland's coal mining industry, training the motherland's coal mining engineering and technical cadres, and serving the motherland's coal mining industry has been established and consolidated in the majority of teachers and students in the whole institute. They know that to build the country, we must develop industry, first of all heavy industry; and to develop industry, we need enough fuel. Therefore, they all feel that serving the motherland's coal mining industry is the most glorious cause, and every student has developed great interest in the coal mining industry.

    Teachers regard training technical cadres for the motherland as their most glorious and happy work. Although some of them have not studied special coal mining technology or lack teaching experience in the past, they can actively study their profession and improve teaching. They know that the development of the coal mining industry is closely related to the development of the motherland's construction cause. For example, Professor Zhang Xinian, deputy director of the coal mining department, said: "When I clearly knew the important role of coal in the national construction cause and saw that the coal production in our country is still very low and the talents are so lacking, I felt the importance of my responsibility. In the past, when I taught, I always taught whatever I had, and said whatever I thought, without a clear teaching purpose. Today, I clearly recognize the training objectives of students and must change this teaching attitude." Because of this, Professor Zhang Xinian can care about the students' studies, and sometimes even personally correct the mistakes in the students' lecture notes. Professor Ren Shude, director of the coal preparation teaching and research group, studied mechanics in the past. When he learned that the country needed talents for the coal mining industry, he happily accepted the job.

    Students all connect their studies with the national construction cause. When the students first entered the school in 1950 and 1951, some students had wrong ideas about studying coal mining, thinking that coal mining was hard and dangerous. Today, the students' thinking has undergone fundamental changes, and the vast majority of students are studying with full enthusiasm and love their majors. Many students say that loving the coal mining industry and serving the coal mining industry is a concrete manifestation of loving the motherland. For example, when the newspaper announced that the quality of coal affected the steel smelting, the second-year students majoring in coal preparation were excited and discussed the issue, expressing that they would strengthen their studies and learn the skills to improve the quality of coal. Many students can help each other and study well. For example, when student Tian Ronglin found that student Hong Wanqi's learning effect was not good, he often helped him, so that he gradually improved. Many students have improved their understanding of the coal mining industry and changed their learning attitudes. For example, student Pang Baixian was very uneasy when he started learning, but after continuous education by the Party and the Youth League organizations, his thinking changed, and he realized the relationship between the coal mining industry and the motherland's construction and people's lives, and studied with peace of mind. When he studied the wind path of the wind drill, he encountered difficulties, so he patiently disassembled the wind drill, carefully studied it, and finally understood it.

    Although Beijing Mining Institute has only traveled a short distance on its development path, it has gradually grown up under the cultivation of the Party and the government, and has trained a new batch of technical cadres for the country. They are playing a creative force in the construction cause, providing more food – coal – for the industry.

    在发展中的北京矿业学院
    李煌果
    北京矿业学院（原名中国矿业学院）是于一九五○年在原焦作工学院的基础上成立的，它是培养煤矿工业技术干部的高等工业学校。
    三年来，学校已有了很大的发展。学生人数由最初的二百人增加到一千九百余人；教师人数也由五十人增加到三百一十七人。目前，北京矿业学院设有五个系七个专业；此外，还建立了普通电工、选煤、金相热处理、采掘机械等十三个实验室（物理化学、矿山电工、矿山设备、煤质分析等九个实验室，将在最近完成）。
    学校方面大力培养了师资。一方面提高老教师的水平，一方面有计划地培养新教师。一九五二年，苏联采煤专家基里耶奇柯夫教授和矿山电工专家斯米尔诺夫教授先后来到学校（最近，苏联矿山测量专家郭尔迭柯也到了学校），他们对学校各方面的工作，尤其是对教师业务水平的提高，起了很大作用。苏联专家分别为教师们开设了采煤方法及矿山电工两门课程，同时，亲自培养教师，使他们能开设课程。现在，在苏联专家的帮助下，教师郭泰已开始讲授采煤方法，马奇教师讲授矿山电工学，吴震春教师讲授普通电工学。学校方面还采取了教师“技术出差”的办法，使教师能到厂矿专门研究一定的问题，以丰富教学内容，并为现场解决某些生产技术上的问题。如开拓工程教研组李迪勋讲师，今年暑假在东北阜新煤矿根据苏联经验进行了钻眼爆破试验（它是巷道掘进中最重要的一环），使钎子的使用效率提高了七点八倍，掘进速度提高了百分之五十。
    教研组的工作，有了改进和提高。一九五二年以前，因领导方面缺乏领导教研组活动的经验，而教师们对教学研究也缺乏足够的认识，因此若干教研组实际上没有什么活动内容。在中央高等教育部的领导和苏联专家的帮助下，经过全体教师们不断的努力，教研组的工作逐步有了改进。苏联专家基里耶奇柯夫曾向全体教师作了关于教研组活动的报告，并亲自参加教研组工作。目前二十六个教研组都有了经常的活动内容，初步能展开批评和自我批评；尤其在帮助开课教师提高教学质量以及培养师资方面，教研组起了一定的作用。目前已有三十七位助教先后开了课。他们的教学效果，一般说来都是好的。这就保证了教学计划的顺利完成。在最近举行的一次教学检查中，各教研组都认真地检查了工作中优缺点，并提出了改进工作的办法。地质教研组教师，加强了团结，克服了要求过多过急的情绪，并加强了试讲工作。其他教研组也都获得了同样的成绩。全国高等工业学校行政会议以后，各教研组更订出了比较具体周密的工作计划，加强了对教学研究的领导。教师们对苏联教材也进行了研究，普遍采用了苏联教本，或按苏联教材编写了讲义。
    热爱祖国的煤矿事业，培养祖国的煤矿工程技术干部及为祖国的煤矿事业服务的思想，已在全院大多数教师、同学中树立、巩固起来。他们知道，要建设国家，必须发展工业，首先是发展重工业；而要发展工业，就需要足够的燃料。因此，他们都觉得为祖国的煤矿工业服务是最光荣的事业，每个同学对煤矿事业发生了极大的兴趣。
    教师们则把为祖国培养技术干部看做自己最光荣和愉快的工作。虽然他们中间有些人过去没有学过采煤方面的专门技术，或者缺乏教学经验，但都能积极地钻研业务，改进教学。他们知道，煤矿事业的发展和祖国建设事业的发展有着密切的联系。如采煤系副主任张熙年教授说：“当我清楚地知道煤在国家建设事业中的重要作用，看到目前我们国家煤的产量还很少，人材又是这样缺乏的时候，就越感觉到自己责任的重大。过去，我教书时总是有什么教什么，想到什么说什么，没有明确的教学目的。今天，我明确认识了学生的培养目标，必须改变这种教学态度。”正因为这样，张熙年教授能关心同学们的学习，有时甚至亲自给同学校正讲义上的错误。选煤教研组主任任树德教授，过去学的是机械，当他知道国家需要煤矿工业人材时，就高兴地接受了这个工作。
    同学们都把自己的学习和国家建设事业联系起来。一九五○年和一九五一年同学们刚入校时，有些同学对学采煤有错误的认识，认为采煤艰苦、有危险。今天，同学的思想情况已有了根本的变化，绝大多数同学都精神饱满地学习着，热爱着自己的专业。很多同学说：热爱煤矿事业，为煤矿事业服务，就是热爱祖国的具体表现。例如，当报纸上公布由于煤的质量不好而影响钢铁冶炼的消息时，选煤专业二年级同学就激动起来了，对这个问题进行了讨论，表示要加强自己的学习，学习提高煤的质量的本领。很多同学能互相帮助，学好功课。如田荣林同学发现了洪万祺同学的学习效果不好时，就经常帮助他，使他逐步提高。有不少同学对煤矿事业的认识有了提高，改变了学习态度。如庞百先同学开始学习时，很不安心，但经过党和青年团组织的不断教育，他的思想转变了，认识了煤矿事业对祖国建设和人民生活的关系，安心地进行学习。当他学到风镐的风路时，遇到了困难，他就耐心地把风镐拆卸开，仔细研究，最后终于把它弄懂了。
    北京矿业学院虽然在自己的发展道路上仅仅走了很短的路程，但它在党和政府的培育下已逐步成长起来，为国家培养了一批新的技术干部。他们在建设事业中发挥了创造性的力量，为工业供给更多的食粮——煤。
