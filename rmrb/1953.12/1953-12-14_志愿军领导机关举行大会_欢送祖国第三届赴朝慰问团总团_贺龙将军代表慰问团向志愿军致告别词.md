    In the morning, cadres and soldiers from various units of the Volunteer Army’s leadership organ, along with members of the cultural troupe carrying beautiful bouquets, waited in neat rows to see off their loved ones. When Chinese People's Volunteer Army Deputy Commander General Yang Dezhi, Political Department Deputy Director General Zhang Nansheng, and others accompanied General He Long, the entire crowd lining the street shouted slogans and threw bouquets and colored paper scraps at the representatives of the delegation.

    On the evening of the 11th, the Volunteer Army's leadership organ held a meeting of more than a thousand people to bid farewell to the delegation. At the meeting, Chinese People's Volunteer Army Deputy Commander General Yang Dezhi delivered a farewell speech. He first expressed his respect to General He Long and all comrades of the delegation on behalf of all commanders and fighters of the army, and expressed his heartfelt gratitude for their hard work in providing comfort over the past two months. After describing the profound education and great encouragement that the delegation's two months of comfort visits had given to all comrades of the Volunteer Army, Deputy Commander Yang said: Dear comrades, as you are about to return to the motherland, please take back the determination of our army's commanders and fighters, and tell Chairman Mao and the people of the motherland: We will resolutely carry out the will of the people of the motherland, unite more closely with the Korean people and the Korean People's Army, actively help the Korean people restore construction, rebuild their homes, and always maintain a high degree of vigilance to strictly prevent any provocations and sabotage activities by the enemy, and persist in fighting to the end for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. We will not only stand firmly at the forefront of the struggle to resist America and aid Korea to defend the great construction of the motherland, but also do everything possible to save money to reduce national expenditures so that the country can concentrate more resources on developing industry and completing the first five-year plan.

    Kim Hwa-seon, Deputy Chairman of a certain Li of the Korean Labor Party, also delivered a speech to bid farewell to the delegation. After praising the great achievements of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and thanking the delegation for their comfort, he also expressed his gratitude to the Chinese people for providing a huge sum of 800 billion won to help the Korean people heal the wounds of war. He said: The Korean people will make the greatest efforts to complete the glorious task of restoring post-war people's economic construction and repay the care of the Chinese people with brilliant victories.
