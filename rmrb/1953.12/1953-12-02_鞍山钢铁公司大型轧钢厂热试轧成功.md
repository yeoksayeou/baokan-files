Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, December 1st: The newly built large rolling mill of Anshan Iron and Steel Company has successfully rolled its first large steel product.

    To prepare for the hot rolling test, the large rolling mill underwent a comprehensive test run on November 27th. On November 29th, all production personnel of the large rolling mill held a solemn oath-taking ceremony. At 8:15 PM on November 30th, the large rolling mill began its hot rolling test. This night was an exciting one. More than eight thousand bright lights illuminated the factory building, making it appear even more magnificent and glorious. On the control panel, rolling foreman Guo Junqing, with excitement and tension, said to those who came to congratulate him: "We are determined to roll the first steel product well and dedicate it to Chairman Mao." On the rolling mill, the young Soviet expert Kuka also took off his clothes and personally wielded a large iron hammer to make a final adjustment to the rollers on the rolling mill. The furnace temperature in the heating furnace rose to over 1200 degrees Celsius. People waited anxiously, and the entire venue was momentarily quiet. Then, the factory director issued the order to start the hot rolling test, which was exactly 8:30 PM.

    Yu Huishun, an operator who had just returned from the Soviet Union after studying modern rolling technology, pressed a button, and the huge motor drove the rolling mill to rotate rapidly. A steel billet weighing more than two tons and emitting flames came out of the heating furnace. The roller table quickly sent the steel billet into the rolling mill. Everyone in the venue cheered, and extraordinary joy appeared on everyone's face. Applause followed the operation of the rolling mill and the undulation of the oscillating table, one after another. The steel billet became longer and longer. When it passed through the last set of rollers, the square steel billet became a round steel product. At this time, even longer and more enthusiastic cheers rang out throughout the venue. The giant python-like round steel continued to move forward along the long roller table. Suddenly, three steel fire lights, several feet high, rose above the hot saw, and the round steel as thick as a bowl was cut into three sections. The round steel quickly rolled to the cooling table. After strict quality inspection, it was proved to be a first-class product. At this moment, Han Tianshi, Secretary of the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Romanenko, Chief Consultant of Soviet Experts, Hua Ming, Acting General Manager of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and Anicheyev, Leader of the Soviet Installation Expert Group, tightly shook hands. Han Tianshi said: "Not long ago, when China's first seamless steel pipe was born, we saw your great labor results. Now, thanks to the help of the Soviet government and the Soviet people, we have once again rolled out the first large steel product." Anicheyev, the leader of the Soviet installation expert group, modestly said: "This is the result of our joint labor under the leadership of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao." They shook hands warmly again and again.

    The hot rolling test became smoother and faster with each billet. In the two hours after the start of the test, the large rolling mill rolled dozens of tons of large round steel. The large mill produces dozens of different specifications of steel, so the test rolling time is relatively long. During the test rolling period, it is planned to first roll round steel and seamless steel pipe billets, and then roll heavy steel rails. In the future, according to the needs of the people of the whole country, various large building steel materials such as angle steel, channel steel, and I-beam will be further rolled.

    鞍山钢铁公司大型轧钢厂热试轧成功
    【新华社鞍山一日电】鞍山钢铁公司新建的大型轧钢厂，已胜利地轧出了第一根大型钢材。
    为了迎接热试轧，十一月二十七日大型轧钢厂进行了全面大试车，二十九日大型轧钢厂的全体生产人员举行了庄严的宣誓大会。在十一月三十日下午八时三刻，大型轧钢厂开始进行热试轧。这一夜，是一个令人兴奋的夜晚，八千多盏明亮的灯光照耀着，厂房里显得更加壮丽辉煌。在操纵台上，轧钢工长郭俊卿怀着兴奋而紧张的心情，向前来祝贺的人们表示：“我们坚决保证轧好第一根钢材献给毛主席。”在轧钢机上，年青的苏联专家库卡也夫把衣服一脱，亲自抡起大铁锤，最后一次矫正了轧钢机上的轧辊。加热炉的炉温升到一千二百度以上了，人们紧张地等待着，全场显出片刻的平静。接着，厂长发出了开始热试轧的号令，这时正是夜晚八时半。
    刚从苏联实习近代化轧钢技术归来的操纵工人于惠顺把电钮一按，巨大的马达就带动轧钢机迅速的运转起来，二吨多重冒着火焰的钢胚从加热炉里出来了，辊道飞速地把这根钢胚送进了轧钢机，全场的人们欢呼起来，每个人的脸上都显出了异常的欢乐。掌声随着轧钢机的运转和摆动台的起伏，一阵接着一阵。钢胚越轧越长了，穿过最后一道轧辊时，方形的钢胚变成圆形的钢材了，这时全场又响起了更加长久热烈的欢呼声，巨蟒似的圆钢沿着漫长的辊道继续前进。突然，在热切锯的上空腾起了三道几丈高的钢铁火光，碗口粗细的圆钢被拦腰切成了三段。圆钢很快的滚到冷却台去了，经过严格的质量检验证明，完全是一级品。这时，中共鞍山市委书记韩天石和苏联专家总顾问罗曼柯，鞍钢公司代总经理华明和苏联安装专家组长安尼切也夫紧紧地握起手来。韩天石说：“不久前，当中国第一根无缝钢管诞生的时候，我们看到了你们伟大的劳动成果；现在由于苏联政府和苏联人民的帮助，我们又一次轧出了第一根大型钢材。”苏联安装专家组长安尼切也夫谦逊地说：“这是在中国人民伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，我们共同劳动的成果。”他们一次又一次的热烈握手。
    热试轧一根比一根顺利，越轧越快，大型轧钢厂在开始试轧的两个多钟头里，就轧制了数十吨重的大型圆钢。大型厂生产着数十种不同规格的钢材，因此试轧的时间比较长，在试轧期间准备先轧圆钢和无缝钢管的管胚，再轧重钢轨。以后根据全国人民的需要进一步轧制角钢、槽钢、工字钢等各种大型建筑钢材。
