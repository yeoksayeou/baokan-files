Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 9th: In a situation where the U.S. side, under the direction of Chiang and Li's special agents, has forced the explanation work of the Korean and Chinese sides into a long-term standstill, today three more Chinese People's Volunteer Army captured personnel and five Korean People's Army captured personnel who escaped from special agent control returned home. This is another bankruptcy of the U.S. side's fabricated lie of prisoners of war "refusing repatriation." After these eight returning personnel were handed over to our side by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in Panmunjom, in front of a large number of neutral countries' personnel and foreign journalists, they exposed the crimes of the U.S., Li, and Chiang special agents in the Dongchang-ri prisoner of war camp, under the command of the U.S. side, who are preparing to hijack our captured personnel for "escape" and continue to torture and kill prisoners of war.

Volunteer Army returnee Lu Guangyi accused the U.S. side of issuing orders to hijack prisoners of war for "escape" through CIE special agent Wang Shunqing, who was lurking in the 17th camp. About ten days ago, Ding Zhengxing, the special agent "deputy battalion commander" of the third camp where Lu Guangyi was located, gathered prisoners of war and said that Wang Shunqing (alias Zhang Yuqing) had received instructions from the U.S. side via radio that after the monitoring period expired, prisoners of war would be forced to collectively escape from the camp to South Korea and then sent to Taiwan. This instruction from the U.S. side stipulated that once the order to escape from the camp was uniformly issued, each camp would immediately cut open the barbed wire and coerce prisoners of war to rush out and escape along the designated route. The instruction stipulated that each prisoner of war should wear a paper tag as an identification mark to prevent prisoners of war from escaping the control of special agents and applying for repatriation in the dark. The instruction also stated that the U.S. military and the Li puppet army were ready to meet the prisoners of war who escaped from the camp, and the trains to transport the prisoners of war were also ready.

Lu Guangyi said that after that, the special agents forced the prisoners of war to conduct two hours of military training every morning and afternoon, saying that they were preparing to go to Taiwan to join the Chiang bandit army. The special agents also prepared a large number of knives, wooden sticks, and other weapons, forced the prisoners of war to make shoes, hats, leggings, and identification marks, and stipulated that once the emergency order was issued, they were not allowed to take off their clothes when sleeping at night and had to pack their backpacks. The special agents also announced that several exercises would be held before the "escape." Lu Guangyi and the other two Volunteer Army captured personnel, Huang Wenqing and Zhong Shijing, who returned today, saw that waiting any longer would only lead to death, so they pretended to be sick and went to the hospital to see a doctor, looking for an opportunity to escape from the camp and apply for repatriation. When they escaped, the "squad leader" and others who escorted them to the hospital chased after them with knives to kill them, but they were driven away by the Indian soldiers.

People's Army returnee An Shiye, who was the "art minister" of the 52nd camp, also heard the Rhee Syngman special agent leaders in the camp discuss the "escape" plan and knew that the plan came from the South Korean "nurses" of the U.S. military's 64th field hospital. An Shiye said that now the special agents in the 52nd camp have collected a large number of knives and wooden sticks and buried them under the beds, and made "Molotov cocktails" with gasoline in glass bottles. An Shiye had been to the 53rd camp and heard the "special agent minister" of the 53rd camp say that they had made more than two hundred bayonets with gasoline drums, ready for use during the collective escape from the camp.

Gao Yongxue, a People's Army captured personnel who escaped from the 50th camp, said that he had seen a password book with more than sixty kinds of contact marks sent from Seoul in the "brigade headquarters," which was also prepared for use during the "escape." Zhao Kuishu, Park Yonggil, and Song Renchun, three People's Army captured personnel who were repatriated together with An Shiye and Gao Yongxue, also revealed that in the 38th, 44th, and 50th camps where they were located, there were similar situations of special agents preparing to hijack prisoners of war for "escape."

At the same time, the U.S., Li, and Chiang special agents' atrocities against prisoners of war are also constantly occurring. Park Yonggil, who escaped from the 50th camp, said that a few days ago, three prisoners of war were caught by special agents for trying to climb the barbed wire fence to escape and request repatriation. They were tortured with sticks, stabbing with sharp knives, pricking fingers, and sitting on tiger benches, and became disabled. Song Renchun, who escaped from the 44th hospital camp, said that ten days ago, he saw four more Volunteer Army captured personnel tied to beds by special agents. The "nurses" told Song Renchun that these four people were "Communist elements" and were prepared to starve them to death. Song Renchun also confirmed the tragic case of Chiang bandit special agents murdering Zhang Liutai in the "hospital." He is another witness to this tragic case.

    我方被俘人员八名逃脱特务控制遣返归来
    揭露特务加紧准备劫持战俘“逃跑”的阴谋
    【新华社开城九日电】在美方指使蒋、李特务强使朝中方面的解释工作陷于长期停顿的情况下，今天又有逃脱特务控制的三名中国人民志愿军被俘人员和五名朝鲜人民军被俘人员遣返归来。这是美方制造的战俘“拒绝遣返”谎言的又一次破产。这八名归来人员在板门店由中立国遣返委员会遣交我方后，即在大批中立国人员和各国新闻记者的面前，揭露了东场里战俘营中美李蒋特务在美方指挥下，正在准备劫持我方被俘人员“逃跑”和继续虐杀战俘的罪行。
    志愿军归来人员陆广义控诉美方经由潜伏在十七号营场的CIE特务王顺清发出劫持战俘“逃跑”的命令。大约十天前，陆广义所在的三号营场特务“副大队长”丁正兴曾集合战俘说，王顺清（化名张玉清）已从无线电中收到美方的指示，要在看管期满后强迫战俘集体越营逃往南朝鲜，再送到台湾。美方这个指示规定，越营命令统一发出后，各营场就要迅即剪开铁丝网，胁迫战俘一拥而出，向指定的路线逃跑。指示规定到时每一战俘都要背一块纸牌作为识别记号，以防战俘在黑夜逃出特务控制申请遣返。指示并说，美军和李伪军都已做好接应越营战俘的准备，载运战俘的火车也准备好了。
    陆广义说，此后，特务们即强迫战俘在每天上下午各进行两小时的军事训练，说是准备到台湾参加蒋匪军。特务们还准备了大批刀子、木棒等武器，强迫战俘做鞋、帽、绑腿和识别记号，并且规定一俟紧急命令下达后，晚上睡觉不准脱衣服，要把背包打好。特务分子还宣布，在“逃跑”之前还将举行几次演习。陆广义和今天归来的另外两个志愿军被俘人员黄文清、钟世敬看到再等下去只有死路一条，就装病到医院看病，寻找机会一齐逃出营场申请遣返。当他们逃走时，押送他们到医院的“小队长”等还拿着刀子追上来要杀他们，但被印度兵赶走了。
    今天归来的人民军被俘人员安石野是五十二号营场的“艺术部长”，他也听到营场里的李承晚特务头子们谈论“逃跑”计划，并知道这个计划是从美军第六十四野战医院的南朝鲜“护士”那里传来的。安石野说，现在五十二号营场的特务已搜集了大批刀子、木棒等埋在床铺底下，并用玻璃瓶子盛汽油做成“燃烧弹”。安石野曾到过五十三号营场，听到五十三号营场的“特务部长”说，他们已用汽油桶做了二百多把刺刀，准备在集体越营时用。
    从五十号营场逃出来的人民军被俘人员高永学说，他曾在“大队部”看到一本从汉城送来的规定了六十多种联络记号的密码册子，也是准备“逃跑”时使用的。与安石野、高永学一同遣返的人民军被俘人员赵奎洙、朴龙吉、宋仁淳三人，也揭露了在他们所在的第三十八、四十四、五十等号营场也有类似的特务准备挟持战俘“逃跑”情况。
    与此同时，美李蒋特务对战俘的暴行也在不断发生。从五十号营场逃出来的朴龙吉说，前几天有三个战俘因想爬铁丝网逃出要求遣返，被特务们捉回去，用棒打、尖刀刺、刺手指、坐老虎凳等酷刑弄成了残废。从四十四号医院营场逃出来的宋仁淳说，在十天前，他看见又有四个志愿军被俘人员被特务们捆在床上，“看护员”告诉宋仁淳说，这四个人是“共产党分子”，准备饿死他们。宋仁淳也证实了“医院”中蒋匪特务谋杀张六泰的惨案，他是又一个目睹这一惨案的证人。
