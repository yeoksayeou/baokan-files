    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 15th - The delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China participating in the bilateral talks on the Political Conference issue issued the following communiqué:

    Our representatives, Qi Shi Fu and Huang Hua, sent a letter to the U.S. representative, Dean, on December 14th, notifying the other party to come to Panmunjom at the scheduled time for the routine meeting on December 15th, and attached the joint statement by representatives Qi Shi Fu and Huang Hua on December 14th regarding the U.S. unilaterally interrupting the bilateral talks.

    The U.S. representative, Dean, replied to our representatives, Qi Shi Fu and Huang Hua, on December 15th, persisting in his unreasonable demands and refusing to come to Panmunjom for the meeting. The Korean and Chinese representatives believe that the U.S. government has once again clearly demonstrated to the world its determination to interrupt the bilateral talks, and its serious responsibility for undermining the convening of the Political Conference cannot be escaped.

    美方代表决心中断双方会谈昨日拒绝复会
    【新华社开城十五日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国参加关于政治会议问题双方会谈的代表团发表公报如下：
    我方代表奇石福、黄华于十二月十四日致函美方代表迪安，通知对方在十二月十五日双方例行会议时间前来板门店开会，并附去奇石福、黄华两代表十四日关于美方片面中断双方会谈的联合声明。
    美方代表迪安于十二月十五日函复我方代表奇石福、黄华，坚持其无理要求，拒绝前来板门店开会，朝中代表认为美国政府已再次明白向世界表明决心中断双方会谈，其破坏政治会议召开的严重责任已无可逃避。
