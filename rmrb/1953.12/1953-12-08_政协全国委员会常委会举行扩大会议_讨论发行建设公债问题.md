Xinhua News Agency, December 7th: The 51st meeting of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was held in an enlarged session on November 30th. Deng Xiaoping, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of Finance of the Central People's Government, delivered a report at the meeting on the issue of issuing the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds. The report first explained the necessity of issuing these bonds. The report pointed out that the country is now entering a period of large-scale construction, and in addition to the vast majority of the state budget’s revenue relying on taxes and the profits of state-owned enterprises, bonds are also one of the items. According to Soviet experience, the issuance of bonds is one of the important and regular methods of raising funds for socialist industrialization. Therefore, the issuance of these bonds has a more important significance. The report then specifically analyzed that the issuance of these bonds is completely in line with the mutual benefit of both the public and private sectors. In urban and rural areas, due to the development of production and construction in recent years, people's living standards have gradually improved, with increased income and savings. Moreover, after the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and various social reform movements, the people's political consciousness has been greatly enhanced. Therefore, the assigned amount of these bonds will definitely be successfully completed, and may even be oversubscribed.

The participants discussed Vice Premier Deng's report, and everyone unanimously expressed their support for this important measure taken by the government to accelerate national economic construction.

Committee Member Huang Yanpei said: It is absolutely necessary to issue economic construction bonds at the beginning of the country's large-scale economic construction period. The amount of these bonds is not large, and the people are fully capable of bearing it. It is hoped that in the promotion, the principle of "taking from surplus" should be grasped in order to better mobilize the people to actively subscribe.

Vice Chairman Chen Shutong said: At the recent Congress of Members of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, three representatives submitted proposals to the congress suggesting that the government issue construction bonds to smoothly complete the economic construction plan and lay the foundation for national industrialization. This shows that the industrial and commercial circles support the government's adoption of this measure that is beneficial to national construction, and they will enthusiastically support and actively subscribe to it.

Vice Chairman Li Jishen said: We fully support the government's measure of issuing the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds. Due to patriotic education in recent years, the political consciousness of the masses has been raised. Therefore, it can be expected that the economic construction bonds issued this time will definitely be oversubscribed.

Committee Member Luo Longji said: The "Report on the 1953 National Budget" passed at the 23rd meeting of the Central People's Government Committee on February 12 this year already proposed issuing bonds at an appropriate time as an item of the national budget this year. Later, for various reasons, it was not issued this year. Now the decision to move it to next year is completely correct. The people of the whole country will definitely actively subscribe, and the results of the issuance will definitely be better than in the past.

Committee Member Xu Deheng said: It is necessary and timely to issue construction bonds now. On the one hand, it can accumulate funds for national construction, and on the other hand, it can enable the people to further express their patriotic enthusiasm. I hope that the publicity work will be done well this time, and the people will be mobilized to quickly and over-fulfill the subscription amount. We all have to take responsibility for publicity.

Mr. Zhu Jisheng, a representative of the industrial and commercial circles attending the meeting, said: Since liberation, under the leadership of the government, we in the industrial and commercial circles have been continuously educated and have gradually gained an understanding of socialist transformation. The issuance of bonds this time is of great educational significance to the industrial and commercial circles, because it is issued to implement the general line of the state's transition period. Private industrialists and businessmen have learned the general line and have been educated to be patriotic and law-abiding. They will definitely play an active role in this bond promotion.

Fu Zuoyi, Huang Shaohong, Ma Yinchu, Lai Ruoyu, Wang Yunsheng, Li Zhuchen, Xu Teli, Li Dequan, Fan Hong, Peng Zemin, Zhang Naiqi, Zhang Xiruo, Li Shucheng, Liu Jingfan, Hu Yaobang, Ma Jian, Shao Lizi, Pan Zhenya and others also spoke at the meeting. All speakers expressed their support for the issuance of bonds and provided many valuable suggestions on the promotion and subscription of bonds.

Those present at the meeting included: Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Zhou Enlai, Li Jishen, Guo Moruo, Chen Shutong, and Standing Committee members in Beijing Li Weihan, Wang Kunlun, Huang Yanpei, Zhang Naiqi, Zhang Xiruo, Liu Ningyi, Deng Yingchao, Liang Xi, Shao Lizi, Deng Xiaoping, Hu Qiaomu, Luo Longji, Shi Fuliang, Ma Yinchu, Huang Qixiang, Xu Deheng, Jiang Nanxiang, Shi Liang, Li Siguang, Qian Sanqiang, Li Dequan, etc., totaling twenty-five people.

Those attending the meeting as observers included: members of the National Committee of the CPPCC in Beijing, members of the Central People's Government Committee, members of the Political Affairs Council of the State Council, heads of various departments of the Central People's Government, representatives of various democratic parties, people's organizations, and industrial and commercial circles in Beijing, totaling more than two hundred people.

    政协全国委员会常委会举行扩大会议
    讨论发行建设公债问题
    【新华社七日讯】中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员会第五十一次会议在十一月三十日扩大举行。中央人民政府政务院副总理兼财政部部长邓小平在会上作了关于发行一九五四年国家经济建设公债问题的报告。报告首先就发行这次公债的必要性作了说明。报告指出：目前正当国家进入大规模建设时期，国家预算的收入部分，除了绝大部分依靠税收和国营企业利润两项以外，公债也是其中的一项。根据苏联的经验，发行公债是筹集社会主义工业化资金的重要的和经常的方法之一，因此，这次公债的发行有它更重要的意义。报告接着具体分析了这次发行的公债是完全符合于公私两利的。在城市和农村中，由于几年来生产建设的发展，人民生活逐步得到改善，收入并有节余，加以经过抗美援朝和各种社会改革运动，人民的政治觉悟大大提高，因此这次公债的分配数额，一定能够胜利完成，而且可能超额完成。
    与会者对邓副总理的报告进行了讨论，大家对政府为加速国家经济建设而采取的这一重要措施，一致表示拥护。
    黄炎培委员说：在国家开始大规模经济建设时期发行经济建设公债，是完全必要的。这次公债的数额并不大，人民是完全有能力来负担的。希望在推销中要掌握“取之有余”的原则，以便更好地动员人民踊跃认购。
    陈叔通副主席说：这次中华全国工商业联合会会员代表大会上，有三位代表向大会提出了提案，建议政府发行建设公债，以顺利完成经济建设计划，为国家工业化打下基础。这说明工商界是拥护政府采取这一有利于国家建设的措施，并且一定会热烈拥护、踊跃认购的。
    李济深副主席说：我们完全拥护政府发行一九五四年国家经济建设公债的措施，由于几年来爱国主义教育，提高了人民群众的政治觉悟，因此，可以预期，这次发行的经济建设公债，一定能够超额完成。
    罗隆基委员说：今年二月十二日中央人民政府委员会第二十三次会议上所通过的“关于一九五三年国家预算的报告”中，就已提出在适当时期发行公债，作为今年国家预算的一项收入，以后因种种原因，今年未能发行，现在决定移到明年发行，是完全正确的。全国人民定会积极认购，发行的成绩一定比过去更好。
    许德珩委员说：现在发行建设公债，很必要，也很及时。一方面可以为国家建设积累资金，一方面又可以使人民进一步表现自己的爱国热情。我希望这次要把宣传工作做好，动员人民迅速地超额地完成认购数额，我们大家都要负起宣传的责任。
    列席会议的工商界代表朱继圣先生说：解放以来，我们工商界在政府领导下不断地受到教育，对社会主义改造逐步有了认识。这次发行公债，对工商界教育意义非常重大，因为这是为了贯彻实行国家过渡时期总路线而发行的。私营工商业者学习了总路线，又受到爱国守法的教育，一定能够在这次推销公债中起积极的作用。
    在会上先后发言的还有傅作义、黄绍竑、马寅初、赖若愚、王芸生、李烛尘、徐特立、李德全、樊弘、彭泽民、章乃器、张奚若、李书城、刘景范、胡耀邦、马坚、邵力子、潘震亚等人。所有发言者都表示拥护公债的发行，并对公债的推销和认购问题提供了许多宝贵意见。
    出席这次会议的，有：中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席周恩来、李济深、郭沫若、陈叔通和在京常务委员李维汉、王昆仑、黄炎培、章乃器、张奚若、刘宁一、邓颖超、梁希、邵力子、邓小平、胡乔木、罗隆基、施复亮、马寅初、黄琪翔、许德珩、蒋南翔、史良、李四光、钱三强、李德全等二十五人。
    列席这次会议的，有：政协全国委员会在京委员，中央人民政府委员会委员、政务院政务委员，中央人民政府各部门负责人，各民主党派、人民团体和在京工商界代表等共二百多人。
