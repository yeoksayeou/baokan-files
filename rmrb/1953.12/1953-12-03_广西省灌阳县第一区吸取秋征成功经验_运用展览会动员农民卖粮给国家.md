Guangxi Province, Guanyang County, First District, Draws on Successful Autumn Grain Collection Experience
	Uses Exhibitions to Mobilize Farmers to Sell Grain to the State

The First District of Guanyang County, Guangxi Province, held a district and township cadre meeting in early November to deploy grain purchase work. The use of exhibitions for political and ideological education produced very good results. The Guanyang County First District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to widely use exhibitions in the district's grain purchase work to educate farmers on the Party's general line for the transition period and on patriotism, and to mobilize farmers to sell surplus grain to the state.

The First District of Guanyang County previously used exhibitions in the autumn agricultural tax collection work to widely conduct patriotic education for farmers, which achieved very good results. All eighteen townships in the district held exhibitions, with a total of thirty exhibitions and over ten thousand viewers. Through the education of the exhibitions, the broad masses of farmers recognized that paying public grain was to support national construction and for the current and long-term interests of the broad masses of the people, and everyone enthusiastically paid public grain. The entire district's autumn grain collection was basically completed and put into storage in less than a month.

In early November, when the First District of Guanyang County held a district and township cadre meeting to deploy grain purchase work, it again held an exhibition to mobilize grain sales, based on the experience of the autumn grain collection work.

The exhibition was divided into three parts. The first part was "Why does the state purchase grain?" This part was divided into four items. The first item was "Support industrial construction." Here, through the use of objects, pictures, tables, etc., the gradual decline in the prices of industrial products such as cloth, salt, and matches in recent years was specifically explained, and the great role of the 141 projects aided by the Soviet Union in our country after their completion in the future was explained, so that visitors could understand the importance of national industrial development and its benefits to farmers; at the same time, the quantity of grain needed by workers in Anshan, Shanghai and other places was explained, so that visitors could recognize that it is necessary to actively sell surplus grain to the state to support national industrial construction. The second item was "Guarantee the needs of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and consolidating national defense." Here, charts and other items were used to illustrate: Due to the corruption and incompetence of the reactionary ruling regime of old China, Japanese imperialism invaded our country, causing heavy losses to the people of the whole country and the local masses; after the founding of New China, the great victory of the three-year struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea ensured the safety of the country, and the people can live and work in peace, so that visitors can recognize the necessity of consolidating national defense and recognize that in order to defend the motherland and their homes, it is necessary to actively sell surplus grain to the state. The third item was "Stabilize prices." Here, charts and other items were used to expose the evil activities of profiteers and landlords in raising grain prices during the "lean season" and in slaughtering and purchasing prices after the new grain was on the market before liberation, as well as the speculative and destructive activities of profiteers in the grain market this year, and to comparatively explain the situation of the people's government purchasing grain at reasonable prices and allocating and supplying grain in a planned way, so that visitors can recognize that the state must have sufficient grain in order to guarantee the needs of the people and stabilize prices. The fourth item was "To create our happy future." Here, the slideshow "The Chinese Farmers Delegation to the Soviet Union Saw Socialist Society" was shown, so that visitors could recognize that they should follow the path of collectivization of Soviet farmers and should sell surplus grain to the state to support the socialist industrialization of the country.

The second part of the exhibition was "Increase production and practice economy, sell more grain to the state." In this part, charts, etc. were used to introduce the achievements of workers in various places in increasing production and practicing economy, and methods for farmers to increase production and practice economy were put forward. At the same time, Xiong Yiqing, the head of Feixiong Township, was also invited to report here on his plan to increase production, practice economy, and sell grain.

The third part of the exhibition was "Where does the money from selling grain go?" In this part, comparative charts of the results of plowing with new-style step plows and old plows were hung up, and items such as chemical fertilizers, shilin cloth, sneakers, and fountain pens were displayed, so that visitors could recognize that the benefits of selling grain to expand production are greater than storing grain, and visitors were educated to use the money from selling grain properly.

After visiting the exhibition, the cadres who participated in the district and township cadre meeting further recognized the significance of the state's purchase of grain and clarified the relationship between industry and agriculture, personal interests and national interests, and immediate interests and long-term interests. Most of the ninety-five township cadres who attended the meeting formulated plans to increase production, practice economy, and sell grain. According to statistics, the cadres planned to sell more than 22,000 jin of rice to the state. At the same time, everyone improved their work confidence and resolved to actively mobilize the masses of farmers to increase production, practice economy, and sell surplus grain to the state.

Now, the Guanyang County First District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has issued "Reference Materials for Using Exhibitions to Conduct Political and Ideological Education for Farmers," and the District People's Government has also prepared two sets of charts and explanations, which are ready to be exhibited in various townships and villages in combination with local characteristics.

    广西省灌阳县第一区吸取秋征成功经验
    运用展览会动员农民卖粮给国家
    广西省灌阳县第一区十一月上旬召开区乡干部会议布置购粮工作时，运用展览会进行政治思想教育，效果很好。中共广西省灌阳县第一区区委会决定在全区购粮工作中，广泛运用展览会的方式，对农民进行国家过渡时期总路线和爱国主义的教育，动员农民把余粮卖给国家。
    灌阳县第一区在农业税秋征工作中曾运用展览会的方式，广泛对农民进行爱国主义教育，收到了很好的效果。全区十八个乡都举行了展览会，先后展出三十次，看过展览的在一万人以上。经过展览会的教育，广大农民认清了缴纳公粮是为了支持国家建设，是为了广大人民目前和长远的利益，大家踊跃交纳公粮。全区秋征公粮，不到一个月的时间，已基本上缴纳入库。
    十一月上旬，灌阳县第一区在召开区乡干部会议布置购粮工作时，又根据秋征工作中的经验，举办了一个动员卖粮的展览会。
    展览会共分三个部分。第一部分是“国家为什么要收购粮食？”这一部分分四个项目。第一项是
  “支援工业建设”。在这里，用实物、图片、表格等，具体说明几年来布匹、食盐、火柴等工业品价格逐渐下降的情况，说明苏联帮助我国建设的一百四十一项工程将来建成后的伟大作用，使参观者认识国家发展工业的重要性和对农民的好处；同时说明鞍山、上海等地工人需要粮食的数量，使参观者认识必须积极把余粮卖给国家，支援国家工业建设。第二个项目是“保证抗美援朝和巩固国防的需要”。在这里，用图表等说明：由于旧中国反动统治政权的腐败无能，日本帝国主义侵入我国，使得全国人民和当地群众遭受惨重损失；新中国成立后，由于三年来抗美援朝斗争的伟大胜利，保证了国家的安全，人民才能安居乐业，使参观者认识到巩固国防的必要性，认识到为了保卫祖国和家乡，必须积极把余粮卖给国家。第三个项目是“稳定物价”。在这里，用图表等项揭露解放前奸商、地主在“青黄不接”时抬高粮价和在新粮上市后杀价收购的罪恶活动，以及今年奸商在粮食市场上进行投机破坏的行为，对比地说明人民政府以合理价格收购粮食，有计划地调拨和供应粮食的情况，使参观者认识必须使国家掌握足够的粮食，才能保证人民需要和物价稳定。第四个项目是“为了创造我们幸福的将来”。在这里，放映“中国农民访苏代表团看到了社会主义社会”的幻灯片，使参观者认识应该走苏联农民集体化的道路，应该把余粮卖给国家，支持国家社会主义工业化。
    展览会的第二部分是“增产节约，把更多的粮食卖给国家”。在这一部分，用图表等介绍了各地工人增产节约的成绩，提出了农民增产节约的办法。同时还请飞熊乡乡长熊义清在这里报告了他的增产节约和卖粮的计划。
    展览会的第三部分是“卖粮得到的钱用到那里去？”在这一部分，挂着用新式步犁和旧犁耕作结果的对比图表，摆出化学肥料、士林布、球鞋、水笔等物品，使参观者认识卖粮扩大生产比存粮的好处大，并教育参观者正当地使用卖粮得到的钱。
    参加这次区乡干部会议的干部，参观了展览会以后，进一步认识了国家收购粮食的意义，认清了工业和农业、个人利益和国家利益、眼前利益和长远利益的关系。到会的九十五个乡干部，大部分人都订出了增产节约和卖粮的计划。据统计，干部们计划卖给国家稻谷二万二千多斤。同时，大家都提高了工作信心，决心积极发动农民群众增产节约，把余粮卖给国家。
    现在，中共灌阳县第一区区委会已印发了“运用展览会对农民进行政治思想教育的参考资料”，区人民政府也制就图表、说明两套，准备在各乡、各村结合当地特点巡回展出。（中共灌阳县第一区委会）
