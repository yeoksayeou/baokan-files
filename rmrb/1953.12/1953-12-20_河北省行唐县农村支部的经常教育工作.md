    I. How Regular Education Work of Rural Branches in Xingtang County Was Developed

    The organization of the Chinese Communist Party in Xingtang County, Hebei Province, has a long history. The Party organization was established as early as 1929, and rural Party branches were widely established after the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War in 1937. Up to now, the county has six district committees, eighty-four township general branches, three hundred and twenty-one branch branches, and nine thousand six hundred and sixty party members, with the number of party members accounting for more than four percent of the county's total population (the county has a total population of more than 230,000). After the establishment of these Party organizations, they have not neglected the work of educating Party members in the spirit of communism, but for a long time, the Party was in a wartime environment, and the Party's education work could not be carried out systematically and regularly due to various objective difficulties. The Party's systematic and regular rural branch education work began to be piloted in April 1949 and was universally established in the county in 1951. Over the past few years, through regular branch education work, the Party has continuously carried out education on socialism and the Communist Party to rural party members and non-party activists throughout the county. At the same time, the regular education work of rural branches itself has also been fixed in a more complete organizational form and system.
    However, the necessity and significance of regular branch education work were not clearly recognized by all the Party organizations and party members in the county from the beginning. The establishment and adherence to the regular education work of rural branches has not been smooth sailing.

    After the national liberation and the completion of land reform, the environment was stable, and the vast number of farmers were also divided into land. As a result, in the cause of restoring and developing rural production, some rural party members mistakenly believed that "the revolution has been successful and there is no need to move forward," and some party members simply "lay down" and did not work; Although another part of the party members are still working actively, the style of commandism is quite serious. As a result, the Party's work in rural areas encountered difficulties. After the public grain tasks for the autumn of 1949 and 1950 were arranged, the tasks could not be completed for a long time because the party members and the branch could not play their due role. This had never happened during the war, but it happened in a peaceful environment and when the lives of farmers had already improved. This incident first aroused the serious attention of the leadership. Therefore, from the winter of 1949 to the spring of 1950, under the direct guidance of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee and the Dingxian Prefectural Party Committee, the training of party member cadres with socialist education as the main content began. This training is divided into two types: one is the centralized training of party member cadres organized by the county party committee (referred to as "intensive training"), and this time 1,507 party member cadres were trained; The second is the universal training of party members organized by the district party committee (referred to as "general training"), and this time most of the rural party members were trained. After this sudden training, great changes took place in the ideology of the broad masses of party members, and the idea of "the revolution is successful and there is no need to move forward" was initially overcome, and some party members who had "lay down" and did not work got up to work again, and rural work also improved somewhat.
    However, the problem will not be solved so easily. Not long after the above-mentioned sudden training, it was generally restored to its original state. Thanks to the Party and the state's multi-faceted leadership and assistance to agricultural production, farmers have obtained unprecedented good conditions in production, and the enthusiasm of farmers for production has increased day by day, and the tendency of "burying their heads in production and not asking about politics" in rural areas has also developed day by day. This tendency obviously cannot but be reflected in the Party, so the original idea of "the revolution is successful and there is no need to move forward" has taken a new turn. At the same time, because the sudden training focused on carrying out education on the socialist future from the front, and failed to give a strong criticism of the style of commandism, this style was not overcome in 1950. To this end, the training work from the winter of 1950 to the spring of 1951 took the education of connecting with the masses as the main content, and concentrated on training 1,070 party members from 144 branches. This training also achieved great results.
    However, the situation after the training from the winter of 1949 to the spring of 1950 was repeated to varying degrees after the training from the winter of 1950 to the spring of 1951.

    At this time, the comrades in Xingtang County could more clearly perceive a law of ideological changes of party members, that is: after a period of sudden training, the ideology of party members improved, and rural work also had a period of activity, but after a period of time, it generally returned to its original state. This situation educated the local Party organizations and party members in charge of work, so that they gradually realized that the work of educating rural party members is an extremely arduous task. Our rural party members are the soldiers of the working class vanguard, but they happen to live in the ocean of small-scale peasant economy, not only because they themselves live a peasant life and therefore have peasant ideas; Moreover, due to the ideological dust of the surrounding peasants, they are constantly exposed to this kind of thinking, so that they are constantly affected by this kind of thinking. Therefore, it is completely insufficient to rely only on sudden training to educate party members, but it is necessary to use the method of regular education to carry out socialist education continuously, overcome the influence of peasant ideas and various non-working class ideas; Only in this way can we gradually improve the consciousness of party members, and will not allow the results of sudden education to gradually disappear due to various reasons.
    The development of regular branch education work in Xingtang also illustrates the cognitive process of county and district Party organizations. At the beginning of April 1949, regular branch education work was only piloted in the Second District and the Sixth District; At that time, the county party committee only generally recognized the necessity of this work, and did not have actual and close experience. The new situation in rural areas in 1950 made the county and district Party organizations have a further understanding, so the work also developed to some extent. After the spring of 1951, the serious significance of this work has been confirmed by most cadres, so it was universally launched throughout the county. And after 1951, the Xingtang County Party Committee has been carrying out in-depth education to rural party members in accordance with the instructions of the provincial party committee and the prefectural party committee, according to the method of combining sudden education and regular education. The basic content of education is the Party's policy of mutual assistance and cooperation in agricultural production, the basic knowledge of socialism and the eight conditions of party member standards.

    From the winter of 1951 to the spring of 1952, the county party committee concentrated on training 1,396 party members from 70 branches. The main content of this intensive training was to explain the eight conditions of party member standards. The year 1952 was a year of great development of the mutual assistance and cooperation movement in the county, and the Party's regular branch education work was closely coordinated with this central work. At the beginning of the year, the first problem encountered in the face of the policy of mutual assistance and cooperation was that some branches did not lead the mutual assistance and cooperation movement, and party members did not participate in the mutual aid groups. The reason is that they only know that participating in mutual aid groups is "to solve the difficulties of labor and livestock." Therefore, they generally believe that "there is no shortage of manpower and livestock, and participating in mutual aid groups is asking for trouble." Grasping the key to this ideological problem, the Xingtang County Party Committee first based on Gao Gang's report on "overcoming the erosion of the Party by bourgeois ideology and opposing right-leaning ideology within the Party," and then adopted the "Agricultural Production Mutual Assistance and Cooperation Textbook" compiled by the Propaganda Department of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee to conduct systematic education. This education did not end until the end of the year when the Party rectification work began. After nearly a year of education, most party members clearly realized the two roads of rural economic development and the nature of mutual assistance and cooperation, and there were few arguments that organizing together was "asking for trouble." According to the statistics at the end of 1952, there were a total of 6,743 party members in the county, who respectively led the masses to participate in mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives. It is extremely rare for branches not to lead the mutual assistance and cooperation movement in the county. The consciousness of party members has been significantly improved, and they said: "In the past, I only knew that organizing together was to do more work and solve the difficulties of labor and livestock, but I knew that it was to build a bridge for socialism!" They also said: "Participating in Party class study, understanding the policies, thinking is clear, and there are also methods." On the other hand, the vast majority of party members have realized the shamefulness of exploitation, and have realized that "Our Party wants to build a communist society, and it is more shameful for ourselves as party members to exploit people!" And gave up exploitation and organized according to the road instructed by the Party.

    From the winter of 1952 to the spring of 1953, the main work in rural areas was Party rectification, and the education of party member standards was universally carried out in the villages where Party rectification was carried out. However, during this period, because the county and district Party organizations concentrated their efforts on Party rectification, the regular branch education work in a few villages was inevitably affected to some extent. In the spring of 1953, the county and district Party organizations promptly paid attention to this situation and used great efforts to rectify it. After the rectification, it quickly returned to normal. The main content of education during this period (until August of this year) was still the Party's policy of mutual assistance and cooperation in agricultural production. Based on the spirit of the "Resolution on Mutual Assistance and Cooperation in Agricultural Production" of the CPC Central Committee, the tendency of blind advancement that had occurred in some villages in the mutual assistance and cooperation movement was corrected, and the tendency of letting things go that occurred later in correcting blind advancement.
    The above is an outline of the development of regular education work of rural branches in Xingtang County in the past four years. From this, we can clearly see the necessity and serious significance of this work. Its effect is also very great. Although it is not easy to point out its specific effects carefully, as Comrade Chen Yongyi, secretary of the Xingtang County Party Committee, said: "Of course, we cannot say that the achievements of rural work are all the effect of branch education, but we cannot do without it at any time, and all work is related to it." This is absolutely correct. That is to say, regular branch education work can not only consolidate the existing achievements of training, but also its most important role is that it can disseminate Marxism-Leninism and socialist ideology to rural party members and non-party activists in many ways and continuously, gradually improve the socialist consciousness of party members and non-party activists, enhance their Party spirit, and constantly overcome the influence of spontaneous capitalist tendencies and the ideas of small peasant producers, so as to purify and consolidate the Party organization ideologically, promote the Party's propaganda work and organizational work, and ensure the realization of the Party's policy of mutual assistance and cooperation and various work tasks in rural areas. Xingtang County is one of the more advanced counties in Hebei Province, and various works in rural areas have achieved remarkable results. Up to now, the number of farmers organized in the county has accounted for 67% of the total number of farmers, there are 65 agricultural production cooperatives (17 of which have not been approved), and agricultural production has also greatly developed. All of these are inseparable from the development of regular education work of rural branches.
    II. Several Key Issues in Carrying Out Regular Education Work of Rural Branches

    To carry out the regular education work of rural branches, the following key issues must be solved: namely, teachers, transmission stations and education content, and teaching methods. If these issues are not resolved well, the work cannot be carried out. So, how did Xingtang solve these key issues?
    (1) Teachers: The rural areas we are facing are scattered, and the distance between villages is quite far, two or three miles in the plains, five or six miles or even more than ten miles in the mountains. Therefore, to carry out regular education for party members and non-party activists scattered in various villages, there must be more teachers; But where do these teachers come from? The cultural and political level of rural party members is very low, and very few can independently undertake the work of teachers, and the number of party member cadres in counties and districts is not large. Therefore, in Xingtang, teachers are divided into two types: one is the teacher who is a party member among county and district cadres, called part-time branch teacher; The second is the teacher who is a party member in the rural branch with a higher cultural and political level, called the rural branch teacher (since May of this year, the branch teacher has been served by the branch education committee member, for the sake of convenient narration, the original name is still used).

    Part-time branch teachers are the main force in carrying out education work at present. After several rectifications, there are currently 146 part-time branch teachers in Xingtang (most of whom are district-level party member cadres). Two problems were encountered at the beginning of the establishment of part-time teachers: First, some party member cadres believed that being a teacher was an extra burden. For example, some said: "There are many heads and many ends, whoever gives the task must do it." "One more basket has one more string." Some said: "You say that class is important, I think work is more important." Second, some party member cadres are willing to serve and think that serving as a branch teacher is very glorious, but they are afraid of not speaking well. To this end, the Xingtang County and District Party Committees adopted the method of summarizing and promoting typical experiences to open up ideas and reverse this situation. The District Party Committee of the First District has done a better job in this regard. They promoted Gao Qingfu's experience to educate all part-time branch teachers in the district. Gao Qingfu is a deputy district chief in charge of mutual assistance and cooperation work, and he was originally very unwilling to serve as a branch teacher. He taught a class in Gaojiazhuang in January this year and found that the three mutual aid groups established in the village in the spring of last year collapsed the best perennial group in the autumn. He learned from the village that it was because the party member Gao Laode (group leader) liked to take advantage of it: mutual assistance was uneven. When Gao Qingfu lectured to the branch, he combined this example to criticize the selfish and self-interested thoughts of individual party members, and repeatedly talked about the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, pointing out that communist party members should adhere to this principle in mutual aid groups and should not take advantage of others; He also led everyone to discuss it, so that the party members received a profound education. After the event, Gao Laode felt that he had done something wrong, cleared up the number of hours owed, and also made a review to Gao Qingfu, and the group was established again. This lecture made Gao Qingfu realize that "class is useful"; Therefore, he changed from passive to active, from organizational obedience to ideological consciousness. The district party committee seized this typical event, and at the plenary meeting of teachers, Gao Qingfu reported his transformation process, and used facts to educate everyone. Since then, other part-time teachers have gradually become active and adhered to the class system. Secondly, in order to improve teaching methods and learn to connect with reality, the district party committee also mobilized everyone to study the method of Zhang Zhengui, a cadre of the district armed forces department, to investigate and understand the ideological situation of party members before class. Zhang Zhengui lectured to the Fentai branch in the spring of last year, and first investigated the organization of the village, and found that all the twelve mutual aid groups they had organized were fake. The branch committee admitted this point when reporting the ideological situation of party members to him. When lecturing, Zhang Zhengui criticized this wrong idea and style of false reports, focusing on the two roads of rural economic development, and the development of mutual aid groups in accordance with the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, and led everyone to review in connection with personal ideas. After this education, the party members felt that they had gained a lot, understood the truth, and were brewing to organize mutual aid groups (afterwards, the district party committee also did specific organizational work, and now the village has seven mutual aid groups and one agricultural production cooperative). After this study, all the teachers realized that in the branch they were responsible for teaching, they not only had to temporarily ask the branch committee members to simply report the ideological situation, but also had to understand the work situation and existing problems there, so that they could truly connect with reality and solve problems when lecturing. The promotion of two typical experiences has deepened the work of part-time teachers. The county and district party committees have been constantly summarizing and promoting such experiences, solving the ideological problems of teachers, learning the method of connecting with reality, and only then can they fully use this force. In addition, the county and district party committees personally help prepare lessons, constantly commend model teachers, criticize irresponsible teachers, and this spring also conducted a county-wide evaluation and award. All of these are good methods to promote the work of part-time teachers. It is precisely because these methods have been adopted that the part-time branch teachers in Xingtang County have become a basic force in adhering to regular education work.

    The task of rural branch teachers is to impart the teaching content of part-time branch teachers and tutor the learners. The cultural and political level of these teachers is not high, a few are high school level, most are junior high school level, and a very few only have a rough understanding of writing. And because they are constantly being promoted to district and township cadres, new supplements are constantly needed. Therefore, in addition to imparting them, actively cultivating them and improving their professional ability and policy level has become a regular work of the Party Committee. To this end, the Xingtang County Party Committee adopted the method of continuous training. In January and July 1952, the County Party Committee trained a total of 652 branch teachers (including transmission station chiefs) twice according to the "Station Chief Business Manual" compiled by the Propaganda Department of the Dingxian Prefectural Party Committee, focusing on improving business ability and solving the cowardly thinking that party members who were afraid of attending classes looked down on themselves. In February of this year, in order to prepare for lecturing on the Marriage Law, 186 branch teachers were trained again, mainly to carry out education on implementing the Marriage Law. In addition, in August last year, in order to improve teaching methods and improve teaching effectiveness, the County Party Committee, together with the District Party Committee of the First District, organized a teaching observation for teachers. Through observation, the teachers themselves summarized three points of experience: First, it is necessary to understand the ideological situation of party members in advance and prepare lessons with the branch committee members; Second, when lecturing, it is necessary to give more practical examples, especially local examples; Third, the central meaning of the text should be repeatedly explained clearly, and after the lecture, it is necessary to lead everyone to discuss and be responsible for answering difficult questions. The County Party Committee then promoted this method throughout the county and achieved great results.
    (2) Transmission System: With part-time branch teachers and rural branch teachers, the problem of attending classes cannot be completely solved, because some rural branch teachers cannot independently prepare courses and must be transmitted by part-time branch teachers. The system in Xingtang County where part-time branch teachers transmit to rural branch teachers at a fixed time and place, and then the branch teachers return to the village to teach or carry out tutoring work is called the transmission system. They began to adopt this transmission system in some areas in April 1949, and it has been popularized to all districts and villages in the county by 1951. Every five to seven villages are together to transmit, which is called a transmission station. At that time, the 321 branches in the county belonged to 53 stations. Each station is equipped with one station chief and one to two deputy station chiefs. In addition to directly teaching classes to branches, part-time teachers generally transmit to station chiefs and teachers twice a month, station chiefs and teachers teach classes to party members three times a month in the slack season, and twice a month in the busy season. After the division of townships in May of this year, the 53 stations were changed to 84 stations (one station per township, with three to four villages under each township). In order to improve the teaching effect and cultivate and improve the professional ability of newly promoted station chiefs and branch teachers (most of the old station chiefs and branch teachers were promoted to township cadres after the division of townships), most of the major courses are directly taught by the district party committee and part-time teachers, and station chiefs and branch teachers only teach minor courses and are responsible for organizing and leading party members to discuss and make up lessons for absent party members. In terms of teaching methods, except for a very few townships that adhere to large classes because the villages are concentrated and the conditions are good, most townships adopt the method that all party members and non-party activists in the village where the township general branch is located participate in the class on the day of the lecture, and other villages within three miles, all branch committee members and group leaders participate, and villages outside three miles only participate in the branch deputy secretary and branch teacher, and teach to all party members and non-party activists (including members of the Youth League) the next day. The teaching time is in the evening, with lectures and discussions each accounting for about one hour. At present, there are 123 branches in the county that adhere to the systems of after-school discussion, leave, roll call, test, and make-up lessons, and the average attendance rate reaches more than 70%; There are 144 branches that do not adhere to various systems regularly enough, and the attendance rate reaches 50% to 70%; There are also 54 branches that can generally adhere to classes. There are no branches that do not study at all.

    The experience of the past few years shows that this system has not only actually formed a relatively sound branch education network, but also station chiefs and branch teachers have gradually been trained into a relatively strong force. At the same time, some difficulties caused by the dispersion of rural areas have been largely overcome.
    (3) Teaching Content and Teaching Methods: With teachers and a transmission system, it is also necessary to appropriately arrange teaching content and solve the problem of connecting theory with practice. On this issue, is it to systematically explain a perennial textbook? Or should we just regard the central work as the content of education? There was controversy on this issue in the early days of establishing regular branch education work. Over the past few years, the Xingtang County Party Committee, under the guidance of the provincial party committee and the prefectural party committee, has adopted the following method: there are basic textbooks throughout the year, such as education on organizing, the "Agricultural Production Mutual Assistance and Cooperation Textbook" compiled by the Propaganda Department of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee was adopted in 1952, and the "Agricultural Production Mutual Assistance and Cooperation Textbook" compiled by the North China People's Publishing House was adopted in 1953. However, when lecturing, according to the development of the work throughout the year and the instructions of the higher party committee, sometimes the major current events that occurred temporarily and the central work of the whole party (not all the central work) are inserted as teaching content, such as the content of the three major tasks of the year was added in January and February this year, and the content of opposing feudal ideological remnants and implementing the Marriage Law was added in March, and the content of democratic education was added in September and October (to prepare for the general election). The reason why the content of education should be arranged in this way is that on the one hand, it is necessary to start from improving the fundamental political consciousness of party members and non-party activists, so there must be basic education that is theoretical and policy-oriented; On the other hand, it is necessary to rely on party members to promote various central works, and at the same time, it is impossible to explain many basic policy issues without linking to the central work, so it is necessary to link to the central work and regard the central work as temporary educational content. So, how to connect with reality in teaching methods? Here, we will only cite the example of how they corrected the laissez-faire tendency in the mutual assistance and cooperation movement to explain. The mutual assistance and cooperation movement in Xingtang County is generally healthy, so the tendency of rash advancement is not serious; But since the proposal to correct the tendency of rash advancement, the tendency of laissez-faire has developed somewhat in those areas with weak mutual assistance foundations. Some seasonal mutual aid groups implement the mutual benefit policy very poorly, gradually forming "collapse in slack time, scattered in busy time, and mutual assistance in busy and slack time." Some laissez-faire arguments that party members are tired of trouble have risen. After the Xingtang County Party Committee found out the various situations in the county, it decided to conduct different education in three types of areas: First, in areas where Party rectification and mutual assistance and cooperation education have been carried out relatively fully and there has been no deviation in the rectification of cooperatives, the focus should be on implementing democratic management within the cooperatives and groups, and solving the idea that party members and non-party activists think things are difficult to handle; Second, in areas where deviations have occurred in the rectification of cooperatives, it is necessary to implement the spirit of the "Resolution on Mutual Assistance and Cooperation in Agricultural Production" of the CPC Central Committee, strengthen confidence, solve problems in actual work, and enable party members and non-party activists to correctly understand the policy of steady development; Third, in areas with weak foundations, the focus is still on education on the direction of rural economic development and the nature of mutual assistance and cooperation, in order to overcome the laissez-faire tendency. After more than half a year of education, the laissez-faire arguments could not be heard. In August, the County Party Committee, according to the instructions of the provincial and prefectural party committees, convened an enlarged cadre meeting of more than 1,000 people, and concentrated on carrying out education on opposing the laissez-faire tendency and correctly understanding the central government's policy on the steady development of mutual assistance and cooperation, so that the laissez-faire tendency in the thinking of grass-roots main cadres, cooperative directors, and mutual aid group leaders was basically corrected, and the mutual assistance and cooperation movement returned to the road of normal development. Experience has proved that this arrangement of education content and implementation of the method of connecting with reality not only adheres to the ideological education and policy education throughout the year, but also promotes the central work, so that the ideological awareness of party members and non-party activists can be continuously improved with the development of the work, so as to always play a core role in various works in rural areas.
    III. Leadership of County and District Party Committees on Regular Education Work of Branches

    Whether the regular education work of branches can be established and adhered to depends entirely on the regular inspection, summary and supervision of the county and district party committees. Our rural areas are scattered, and rural work tasks are very heavy. After each central work is issued, party organizations at all levels and all party members and non-party activists are unusually busy, so the regular education work of branches is in danger of being shelved; At the same time, the effect of regular education work of branches is not easy to see in a short period of time. Therefore, the argument that cadres and party members cancel branch education still appears from time to time. Therefore, it is the serious responsibility of the Party organization to constantly overcome various obstacles and continuously promote this work forward.
    In the early days of establishing this work, the first situation encountered was that the propaganda committee member of the district party committee was fixed in a small area for a long time to do central work or used as a mobile cadre, and the propaganda and education work plan of the county party committee could not be implemented. The district party committees believed that the branch education work and the central work were contradictory. Therefore, although the class date was stipulated, it was often squeezed out, and the class time was used to arrange work. At the same time, the district party committee propaganda committee members lacked confidence in the branch education work, were not proactive, and could not submit the plan to the party committee for discussion on schedule. At that time, in order to solve this problem, the county party committee took the following measures: (1) At each meeting, on the one hand, it used some specific examples of education, improving the awareness of party members, and transforming the entire work to persuade the district party committees to believe in the important role of education; At the same time, it inspected the execution of the propaganda and education work plan of the county party committee by the districts to reverse their erroneous view that branch education was contradictory to the central work; (2) Mobilize all propaganda committee members to repeatedly discuss and check whether the district party committee does not pay attention to the branch education work? Or is the propaganda committee member not proactive? Has it used vivid facts to publicize to the district party committee, first of all, the district party committee secretary, in order to win their attention to the branch education work? After each discussion and ideological check, the district party committee propaganda committee members clearly realized two problems: First, be proactive in work; Second, use facts to publicize to the district party committee, first of all, the district party committee secretary. (3) Commend the First and Fifth District Party Committees for being able to quickly implement the propaganda and education work plan of the county party committee, and the spirit of the District Party Committee Propaganda Committee members Yang Tai and Yang Zocai being active and responsible in their work, and call on all districts to learn from them; At the same time, it criticized the Second District Party Committee and Secretary Li Wenzhong for not paying attention to the tendency of propaganda and education work, and asked them to quickly correct it. In this way, the Xingtang County Party Committee spent about a year or so (from 1949 to the first half of 1950) to clear the obstacles from the ideological leadership of the district party committee, reverse the tendency to neglect this work, and lay the foundation for carrying out regular education work in rural branches.

    In order to adhere to and continuously improve the regular education work of branches, the County Party Committee has stipulated a regular meeting system and an inspection, summary and reward system. The county and district party committees' regular meeting system includes: The county committee studies propaganda and education work once a month (branch education is one of the main contents). A meeting of district party committee propaganda committee members is held every month or two, and a meeting of part-time teachers is held every two months. The district committee studies the ideological situation of party members in the district once a month and holds a meeting of part-time teachers. Through these meetings, work plans, instructions, the ideological situation of party members are discussed, experiences are exchanged, and tasks are assigned. These systems have been adhered to, so the county and district party committees can regularly grasp the ideological situation of party members in the county and continuously improve the regular education work of rural branches.

    As for the summary, inspection and reward, it is also very regular. When carrying out mutual assistance and cooperation education in 1952, the County Party Committee organized four inspections (baseline surveys). The first time it was found that party members generally lacked confidence in organizing and were afraid of suffering losses; The second and third inspections found that party members had a hasty and rash mood, and many of the mutual aid groups that had been organized were formalistic; The fourth inspection was to understand the extent to which party members understood the mutual assistance and cooperation policy through tests. The test results showed that most party members understood the direction of rural economic development, the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, and the truth that party members should actively participate in and lead the mutual assistance and cooperation movement. The results were not good in some villages. For example, in Wang Village in the Fourth District, 12 party members were tested, and only one party member understood the direction of rural economic development, and the others only knew that it was to solve the difficulties of labor and livestock. These four inspections clarified the "bottom line" of organizing, and the ideological situation of party members was also fully grasped. The County Party Committee poured the ideological problems found into the training of station chiefs and branch teachers and then into the branch education, clarifying some confused ideas of party members and promoting the development of the mutual assistance and cooperation movement.
    In April of this year, according to the instructions of the prefectural party committee, a model station chief and a model part-time teacher were selected. Eight model station chiefs were selected from the 87 station chiefs and deputy station chiefs in the 53 stations in the county. Among the 102 part-time branch teachers in the county and district, a total of seven model teachers, including Song Guoqing, were selected. The County Party Committee deployed this selection work in February. The districts and villages were brewing on the one hand, and then a friendly competition between stations and stations, villages and villages, and teachers and teachers was launched. This selection was actually a comprehensive inspection of the branch education work, and those relatively backward villages have been transformed, and station chiefs and teachers who were not very responsible have also become active. The selection results set an example for the districts and villages and promoted the branch education work. The adherence to the above-mentioned systems has played a certain role in ensuring the regularity of branch education work and has played a certain role in promoting the improvement of the quality of branch education.

    Secondly, the Xingtang County Party Committee believes that the key to whether party member learning can be done well lies in the core leadership role of the branch committees of each township and village. Because only when the branch committee plays a core leadership role can it regularly promote party member learning through criticism and self-criticism, and the system of branch education work can only be established and adhered to through democratic discussion by party members under the leadership of the branch. Therefore, the County Party Committee adopted the method of summarizing and promoting typical experiences to strengthen the leadership of the branches. The County Committee successively summarized the typical experiences of Nanfuliu and Nanjiasu villages in carrying out regular branch education work in March 1950 and December 1951. The common features of these experiences are: (1) Strengthening the ideological leadership of the branch committee over party members, promptly commending party members who are active and have achieved results in learning, helping backward party members, criticizing party members who do not study well, and combining the monthly life review meeting with the inspection of each person's learning results, so that party members' learning enthusiasm is always full; (2) Mobilize all party members to discuss and formulate learning covenants, make resolutions, and everyone abides by them. Both branches have stipulated class dates, roll call, leave, tests, commendations, criticisms, make-up lessons and other systems, and they have adhered to them very well; (3) In order to make party member learning a habit, the class address is fixed; (4) Listen to party members' opinions and improve teaching methods at any time. The specific practice of the Nanjiasu Village Branch is to absorb the backbone members of the party members to participate in the leadership in addition to the branch committee, and then mobilize the party members to discuss the issue of the standards of communist party members, so that most party members understand the truth that they cannot be good party members if they do not study. Then the branch committee commended Fu Zhongxin and Li Fulai, who were active in learning, and criticized Jia Jiushu and Fu Luofang, who did not study well, at the branch meeting. All branch committee members and active learners were assigned to be responsible for helping backward party members learn. Since then, the erroneous saying that "you can complete the work without studying" can no longer be heard among party members. In order to make the learning enthusiasm can be regularly consolidated. After everyone's discussion, it was stipulated that a party member meeting would be held on the 29th of each month (lunar calendar) to check each party member's thinking, work and study using criticism and self-criticism. Since then, not only has the learning been done well, the organizational life system has been sound, but also criticism and self-criticism has been launched. Roll call, leave, tests, make-up lessons and other systems, as well as a fixed class address, were established and adhered to after mobilizing the enthusiasm of party members for learning. The County Party Committee summarized and reported these experiences, which had a great impact at the time. At present, more than 120 branches in the county have used these experiences to improve their work and become better branches, and most of the other branches can also lead the branch education work. Only a few branches cannot lead or cannot lead much.
    The above is the basic situation and main experience of the Xingtang County District Party Committee leading the branch education work. Of course, the branch education work in Xingtang County still has its shortcomings and areas worth improving. For example, at present, the education work of a small

    河北省行唐县农村支部的经常教育工作
    李杏村、张海波
    一、行唐县农村支部经常教育工作是怎样开展起来的
    河北省行唐县中国共产党的组织，具有很长久的历史。远在一九二九年就开始建立了党的组织，一九三七年抗日战争爆发后，便普遍地建立了农村党的支部。至今为止，全县已有六个区委、八十四个乡总支部、三百二十一个分支部、九千六百六十个党员，党员人数占全县总人口的百分之四强（全县人口共二十三万多）。党的这些组织建立后，就没有忽略过以共产主义精神教育党员的工作，但在很长的时期内，党处于战争的环境中，党的教育工作由于各种客观上的困难便不可能系统地、经常地进行。党的系统的、经常的农村支部教育工作在一九四九年四月开始试办，而在一九五一年才在全县普遍建立的。数年以来，党通过经常的支部教育工作，不间断地向全县农村党员和非党积极分子进行了关于社会主义和共产党的教育，同时，农村支部的经常教育工作本身，也以一种较为完整的组织形式和制度固定下来了。
    但是，对于经常的支部教育工作的必要性和意义，并不是一开始就为全县党的组织和党员所明确认识的。农村支部的经常教育工作的建立和坚持，也不是一帆风顺的。
    全国解放和土地改革完成以后，环境安定了，广大农民又分得了土地。于是，在恢复与发展农村生产的事业中，有些农村党员，就错误地认为“革命成功、不需前进”，有的党员竟“躺倒”不干工作了；另一部分党员虽仍积极工作，但强迫命令的作风相当严重。因此，使党在农村的工作遭到困难。一九四九年和一九五○年秋季的公粮任务布置下去之后，由于党员和支部不能发挥应有的作用，很长时间不能完成。这是在战争期间所不曾有过的，却竟在和平环境中、农民生活业已提高的情况下发生了。这件事，首先引起了领导方面的严重注意。因此于一九四九年冬季到一九五○年春季，在河北省委和定县地委的直接指导之下，开始了以社会主义教育为主要内容的党员干部训练工作。这种训练分两种：一种是由县委主办的对党员干部的集中训练（简称“集训”），这次训练了一千五百零七个党员干部；一种是由区委主办的对党员的普遍训练（简称“普训”），这次训练了农村的大部分党员。经过这次的突击性的训练，广大的党员群众在思想上发生了很大的变化，所谓“革命成功、不需前进”的思想得到了初步的克服，有些已经“躺倒”不干工作的党员又起来工作了，农村工作也有了若干起色。
    然而，问题是不会这样轻易得到解决的。上述的突击性的训练过去不久，又大体恢复了原状。由于党和国家对农业生产的多方面的领导和帮助，农民在生产上得到了从所未有的良好条件，农民的生产积极性日益增长了，农村的“埋头生产、不问政治”的倾向，也跟着日益发展了。这种倾向显然不能不反映到党内来，因而原有的“革命成功、不需前进”的思想又有了新的抬头。同时，因为突击训练着重于从正面进行社会主义前途的教育，对强迫命令作风未能予以有力的批判，所以在一九五○年内这种作风就没有得到克服。为此，一九五○年冬季到一九五一年春季的训练工作，便以联系群众的教育为主要内容，集中训练了一百四十四个支部的一千○七十个党员。这次训练同样收到了很大的效果。
    然而，一九四九年冬季到一九五○年春季训练后的情况，在一九五○年冬季到一九五一年春季训练以后，又在不同程度上重复地发生了。
    这时候，行唐县的同志们已经可以更清楚地觉察到党员思想变化的一种规律，那就是：经过一段突击性的训练之后，党员思想提高了一步，农村工作也有一个时期的活跃，但过了一段时间之后，又大致恢复原状了。这个情况教育了当地党的组织和做负责工作的党员，使他们逐步体会到：教育农村党员的工作是一项极其艰巨的工作。我们的农村党员是工人阶级先锋队的战士，但是他们恰恰生活在小农经济的海洋中，不仅由于他们自己过着农民的生活，因而具有农民的思想；而且由于四周围的农民的思想灰尘，每时每刻都向他们扑来，使他们不断地受到这种思想的影响。因此，教育党员的工作仅仅依靠于突击性的训练已经完全不够了，而必须用经常教育的方法不间断地进行社会主义教育，克服农民思想及各种非工人阶级的思想影响；并且只有这样，才能逐步提高党员的觉悟，才不会使突击性的教育成果，由于种种原因而逐渐消失。
    行唐的经常的支部教育工作的发展，也恰恰说明县、区党的组织的这一认识过程。一九四九年四月初，仅在二区和六区试办经常的支部教育工作；那时，县委还仅是一般地认识这一工作的必要性，还没有实际的亲切的体验。一九五○年农村发生的新状况，使县区党的组织有了进一步的体会，因而工作也有了若干发展，到了一九五一年春天后，这一工作的严重意义，已经为大多数干部所确认，所以就在全县普遍展开了。而在一九五一年以后，行唐县委就一直依据省委、地委的指示，按照突击性教育与经常性教育相结合的方法，对农村党员进行了深入的教育，教育的基本内容就是党的农业生产互助合作政策、社会主义的基本知识和党员标准的八项条件。
    一九五一年冬季至一九五二年春季，县委集训了七十个支部一千三百九十六名党员，这次集训的内容主要是讲解党员标准的八项条件。而一九五二年是全县互助合作运动大发展的一年，党的经常的支部教育工作，也就紧密地配合着这一中心工作进行。年初，在实行互助合作方针的面前最先碰到的难题，就是有些支部不领导互助合作运动，党员不参加互助组。原因是他们只知道参加互助组是“为了解决劳畜力的困难”。所以，他们普遍认为“不缺人力、畜力，参加互助组是自找麻烦。”抓住这个思想症结所在，行唐县委首先依据高岗同志“克服资产阶级思想对党的侵蚀，反对党内的右倾思想”的报告，继而采用河北省委宣传部所编“农业生产互助合作教材”，进行了系统的教育。这一教育，一直到年底整党工作开始才结束。经过近一年来的教育，大部分党员明确地认识了农村经济发展的两条道路和互助合作的性质，就很少再出现组织起来是“自找麻烦”的论调了。据一九五二年底的统计，全县共有六千七百四十三名党员，分别带动群众参加了互助组和农业生产合作社。支部不领导互助合作运动的，在全县说来是极少数了。党员的觉悟有了显著的提高，他们说：“过去只知道组织起来是为了多干活，解决劳畜力的困难，那知是给社会主义搭桥梁！”又说：“参加党课学习，了解了政策，思想通了，也有了办法。”另一方面，绝大部分党员都认识了剥削的可耻，已觉悟到“咱们党要建立共产主义社会，自己是党员还剥削人，多丢人！”而放弃了剥削，按照党所指示的道路组织起来了。
    在一九五二年冬季至一九五三年春季，农村的主要工作是整党，在整党的乡村中普遍地进行了党员标准的教育。但这一时期内因为县、区党的组织集中全力进行整党，所以少数村庄的经常支部教育工作，就不免受到一些影响。一九五三年春季，县、区党的组织及时地注意了这种情况，并用了很大的力量加以整顿。整顿后，就又很快地转入常态了。这时期（至本年八月）的主要教育内容还是党对农业生产互助合作的政策，依据中共中央“关于农业生产互助合作的决议”的精神，纠正了部分乡村在互助合作运动中曾经发生过的盲目冒进倾向，和以后在纠正盲目冒进时又发生的放任自流倾向。
    以上就是四年多来行唐县农村支部的经常教育工作发展的一个轮廓。从此，可以使我们清楚地看到这一工作的必要性和严重意义。它的效果也是很大的。虽然，要仔细地指出它的具体效果并不容易，正如行唐县委书记陈永义同志所说：“我们当然不能把农村工作的成绩都说成支部教育的效果，但是不论什么时候都离不开它，不论什么工作都跟它有关系。”这是完全正确的。这就是说，经常的支部教育工作不仅可以巩固训练的既得成果，而且它的最重要的作用，就在于能够多方面地、不间断地向农村党员和非党积极分子传播马克思列宁主义及社会主义思想，逐步提高党员和非党积极分子的社会主义的觉悟，增强他们的党性，并不断地克服自发的资本主义倾向的影响和农民小生产者的思想，从而从思想上纯洁和巩固党的组织，推动党的宣传工作和组织工作，保证党在农村的互助合作方针和各项工作任务的实现。行唐县是河北省的较先进的县份之一，农村的各种工作均有显著的成绩。至目前为止，全县组织起来的农户已占全体农户的百分之六十七，农业生产合作社共六十五个（其中未批准的十七个），农业生产也有很大的发展。所有这些，都是与农村支部的经常教育工作的开展分不开的。
    二、开展农村支部经常教育工作的几个关键问题
    要把农村支部的经常教育工作开展起来，必须解决以下几个关键问题：即教员、传授站和教育内容、教学方法。这几个问题如果解决得不好，工作是无法开展的。那么，行唐是怎样解决这几个关键问题的呢？
    （一）教员：我们所面对的农村是分散的，村与村的距离相当远，平地有两三里，山地五六里甚至有十几里的。因此，对分散在各村的党员和非党积极分子进行经常的教育，就必须有较多的教员；但是，这些教员从那里来呢？农村党员文化政治水平都很低，能够独立地担负教员的工作的非常之少，而县区党员干部数量又不多。所以，在行唐，教员分两种：一种是由县区干部中的党员担任的教员，叫兼职支部教员；一种是由文化政治水平较高的农村支部中的党员担任的教员，叫农村支部教员（从今年五月份起，支部教员已由支部教育委员担任，为了叙述方便起见，仍用原名）。
    兼职支部教员是目前进行教育工作的主要力量，行唐的兼职支部教员经过多次的整顿，至目前为止，共有一百四十六人（其中多数是区级党员干部）。兼职教员一开始建立，就碰到两个问题：一、一部分党员干部，认为当教员是额外负担。例如有的说：“多头多绪，谁给任务也得干。”“多一个篮子多一个系。”有的说：“你说上课重要，我看工作更重要。”二、一部分党员干部愿意担任，并认为担任支部教员很光荣，但怕讲不好。为此，行唐县、区党委采取了通过总结、推广典型经验、打通思想的办法，扭转了这个局面。一区区委在这方面做得较好。他们推广了高庆福的经验，以此教育了全区兼职支部教员。高庆福是个副区长，专管互助合作工作，原来很不愿意担任支部教员。他在今年一月份给高家庄上课，发现该村在去年春季成立的三个互助组，到秋天垮了一个最好的常年组。他到村里一了解，原来是党员高老德（组长）好占便宜：互助不齐工。高庆福在给支部讲课时，结合这个实例，批判了个别党员的自私自利思想，反复讲了自愿互利的原则，指出共产党员在互助组里应坚持这个原则，不应占别人的便宜；并领导大家作了讨论，使党员们受了一次深刻的教育。事后高老德觉着自己办错了事，清理了所欠工数，还向高庆福作了检讨，那个组又成立起来了。这次讲课，使高庆福认识到：“上课顶事”；因而由消极到积极、由组织服从到思想上自觉了。区委抓住这个典型事例，在全体教员会议上，由高庆福报告了他转变的经过，用事实教育了大家。此后，其他兼职教员，便逐渐积极起来，坚持上课制度了。其次，为了改进教学方法，学会联系实际，区委又发动大家研究了区武装部干部张振国同志上课前先调查了解党员思想情况的方法。张振国去年春季给坟台支部上课，先调查了该村组织起来的情况，发现他们已经组织起来的十二个互助组全是假的。支委会向他汇报党员思想情况时都承认这一点。张振国在讲课时，批判了这种假报告的错误思想和作风，着重讲了农村经济发展的两条道路，以及应按照自愿互利的原则发展互助组，并领导大家联系个人思想作了检查。这次教育，党员们都觉得收获很大，懂得了道理，都酝酿着要组织互助组（事后区委又作了具体的组织工作，现在该村共有七个互助组，一个农业生产合作社）。经过这次研究，全体教员都认识到，在自己所负责上课的支部里，不光是临时找支部委员简单的汇报思想情况，而且还要了解那里的工作情况和存在的问题，才能在讲课时真正做到联系实际，解决问题。两个典型经验的推广，使兼职教员工作深入了一步。县、区党委都是在不断地总结和推广了这样的经验，解决了教员思想问题，学会了联系实际的方法，才把这支力量充分地使用起来的。加之县区党委亲自帮助备课，不断表扬模范教员，批评不负责任的教员，今春又进行了全县评奖。所有这些，都是推动兼职教员工作的良好方法。正是因为采用了这些方法，所以目前行唐县的兼职支部教员，已经成为一支坚持经常教育工作的基本力量了。
    农村的支部教员的任务是传授兼职支部教员的授课内容和辅导学习者的学习。这些教员的文化、政治水平都不算高，其中少数是高小程度，多数是初小程度，还有极少数仅粗通文字。又因为他们不断地被提拔为区、乡干部，不断要有新的补充。所以，除了向他们进行传授外，积极培养他们和提高他们的业务能力、政策水平，就成为党委的经常的工作。为此，行唐县委采用了不断训练的办法。一九五二年一月和七月份，县委根据定县地委宣传部所编的“站长业务手册”，两次共训练了支部教员（包括传授站站长）六百五十二人，着重在提高业务能力，解决怕听课的党员看不起自己的怯懦思想。今年二月份，为给讲授婚姻法做准备，又训练了支部教员一百八十六人，主要是进行贯彻婚姻法的教育。此外，在去年八月份，县委为了改进教学方法，提高教学效果，协同一区区委，组织了一次教员的教学观摩。通过观摩，教员自己总结出三点经验：一、要事先了解党员思想情况，并和支部委员共同备课；二、讲课时要多举实际例子，特别是本地方的例子；三、把课文的中心意思反复讲清楚，讲后要领导大家讨论，并负责解答疑难问题。县委接着在全县推广了这个方法，并收到了很大的效果。
    （二）传授制度：有了兼职支部教员和农村支部教员，还不能完全解决上课问题，因为，有些农村支部教员不能独立地准备课程，而必须经过兼职支部教员的传授，行唐县的由兼职支部教员在固定的时间和地点向农村支部教员传授，再由支部教员回村授课或进行辅导工作的制度，就叫传授制度。他们从一九四九年四月份就在部分地区开始采用这种传授制度，至一九五一年已普及到全县各区各村。每五个至七个村在一起传授，这就叫传授站，全县三百二十一个支部，当时分属于五十三个站。每站配备站长一人副站长一人至两人，兼职教员除了自己直接给支部上课外，在一般情况下，向站长、教员每月传授两次，站长、教员给党员上课，农闲季节每月三次，农忙季节每月两次。今年五月份划乡后，把五十三个站改为八十四个站（一乡一站，一乡辖三至四个村。）又为了提高教学效果，培养和提高新提拔起来的站长和支部教员（划乡后大部分老站长和支部教员被提拔为乡干部）的业务能力，大部分主要课程，由区委和兼职教员直接讲授，站长和支部教员只讲次要课，并负责组织领导党员讨论，给缺课党员补课。授课的方法，除极少数乡因为村庄集中，条件好，坚持上大课外，绝大部分乡则采用了只乡总支所在村的全体党员和非党积极分子于授课日参加听课，其他各村在三里地以内的，全体支部委员和小组长参加，三里地以外的只支部副书记和支部教员参加，回去第二天向全体党员和非党积极分子（包括团员）授课。授课时间都在晚上，讲课和讨论各约占一小时。目前全县坚持课后讨论、请假、点名、测验、补课等制度的有一百二十三个支部，到课人数平均达百分之七十以上；有一百四十四个支部对各种制度坚持得不够经常，到课人数达到百分之五十到七十；还有五十四个支部在一般情况下可以坚持上课。根本不学习的支部是没有的。
    几年来的经验说明，这种制度，不仅在实际上已经形成一个比较健全的支部教育网，而且站长和支部教员也逐渐锻炼成为一支比较坚强的力量，同时因农村分散所产生的一些困难，大体上都已克服了。
    （三）教学内容与教学方法：有了教员，有了传授制度，还需要适当安排教学内容和解决理论联系实际的方法问题。在这个问题上，到底是系统地讲解一种常年用的课本呢？还是就把中心工作当作教育内容呢？这个问题在建立经常支部教育工作的初期是有争论的。几年来，行唐县委在省委、地委的指导下，所采取的方法是：全年有基本教材，如关于组织起来的教育，一九五二年采用河北省委宣传部所编的“农业生产互助合作教材”，一九五三年采用华北人民出版社所编的“农业生产互助合作教材”。但在讲授时，则根据全年工作发展的情况和上级党委的指示，有时把临时发生的重大时事问题和全党一致的中心工作（不是所有的一切中心工作），作为教学内容插进去，如今年一、二月份增加了全年三大任务的内容，三月份增加了反对封建思想残余、贯彻婚姻法的内容，九、十月份增加了民主教育的内容（为普选做准备）。教育内容之所以要这样安排，一方面因为要从提高党员与非党积极分子的根本的政治觉悟着眼，所以必须有带理论性、政策性的基本教育；另一方面是因为要依靠党员去推动各种中心工作，同时不联系中心工作，也无法讲解许多基本的政策问题，所以，不能不联系到中心工作，把中心工作做为临时的教育内容。那么，在教学方法上如何联系实际呢？这里只举他们怎样纠正互助合作运动中的自流倾向一例来加以说明。行唐县的互助合作运动一般是健康的，所以，冒进倾向并不严重；但自从提出纠正冒进倾向以后，那些互助基础较弱的地区，放任自流的倾向就有了一些发展。有些季节性的互助组执行互利方针很差，逐渐形成“闲时垮台，忙时散，不忙不闲互助干。”党员中嫌麻烦的自流论调有些抬头。行唐县委在摸清了全县的各种情况以后，便决定分三种地区进行不同的教育：一、在整党、互助合作的教育进行得比较充分、整社没有发生偏差的地区，着重贯彻社、组内的民主管理，解决党员和非党积极分子中认为事情难办的思想；二、在整社发生偏差的地区，便要贯彻中共中央“关于农业生产互助合作的决议”的精神，坚定信心，解决实际工作中的问题，使党员和非党积极分子正确认识稳步发展的方针；三、在基础薄弱的地区，仍然着重关于农村经济发展的方向与互助合作的性质的教育，以克服自流倾向。经过半年多的教育，自流的论调听不见了。八月份，县委根据省、地委的指示，召开了千余人的扩大干部会议，集中地进行了反对放任自流倾向，正确认识中央关于稳步发展互助合作的方针的教育，使基层主要干部、合作社长和互助组长思想上的放任自流倾向，基本上得到了纠正，使互助合作运动又走上了正常发展的道路。经验证明，这样安排教育内容和贯彻联系实际的方法，既坚持了全年的思想教育和政策教育，又推动了中心工作，使党员和非党积极分子的思想觉悟，可以随着工作的发展而不断提高，从而始终在农村的各种工作中起到核心作用。
    三、县、区委对支部经常教育工作的领导
    经常的支部教育工作要能够建立起来并坚持下去，全赖于县、区委的经常的检查、总结和督促。我们的农村是分散的，农村工作任务又是十分繁重的，每一个中心工作下达之后，各级党的组织和全体党员及非党积极分子都是异常繁忙，因而经常的支部教育工作就有搁浅的危险；同时，经常的支部教育工作的效果，又是不容易在短时期内看得出来的。所以，干部党员中取消支部教育的论调还是不时出现的，因此，经常克服各种阻碍，不间断地把这一工作向前推进，就是党组织的严重责任。
    在建立这一工作的初期，首先遇到的情况是区委宣传委员长期被固定在一个小区里做中心工作或当机动干部使用，县委的宣传教育工作计划贯彻不下去，区委们认为支部教育工作和中心工作有矛盾，因而，虽然规定了上课日期，却常常被挤掉，利用上课时间布置工作。同时，区委宣传委员对支部教育工作缺乏信心，不主动，不能按期作出计划交党委会讨论。当时，县委为了解决这一问题，就采取了如下办法：（一）在每次会议上，一方面用一些经过了教育、提高了党员觉悟、使整个工作转变了的具体事例，说服各区区委相信教育的重大作用；同时检查各区执行县委宣传教育工作计划的情况，以扭转他们认为支部教育和中心工作相矛盾的错误观点；（二）发动全体宣传委员反复讨论、检查，究竟是区委不重视支部教育工作呢？还是宣传委员不主动？是否用过活的事实向区委首先是区委书记作过宣传，以争取他们重视支部教育工作。经过每次的讨论和检查思想以后，使区委宣传委员明确认识了两个问题：第一，工作上要主动；第二，用事实向区委会首先是区委书记作宣传工作。（三）通报表扬一区、五区区委会能迅速地贯彻县委宣教工作计划，及区委宣传委员杨太、杨佐才在工作上积极主动负责的精神，并号召各区向他们学习；同时，通报批评了二区区委会及书记李文忠不重视宣教工作的偏向，要求他们迅速纠正。就这样，行唐县委大约用了一年多的工夫（一九四九年至一九五○年前半年）才从区委领导思想上扫清了障碍，扭转了忽视这个工作的偏向，奠定了开展农村支部的经常教育工作的基础。
    为了坚持和不断提高经常的支部教育工作，县委规定了定期的会议制度和检查、总结、评奖制度。县、区委定期的会议制度有：县委会每月研究一次宣传教育工作（支部教育是其中主要内容之一）。每月或两个月召开一次区委宣传委员会议，每两月召开一次兼职教员会议。区委会每月研究一次全区党员思想情况，并召开一次兼职教员会议。通过这些会议，讨论工作计划、指示，党员思想情况，交流经验，布置任务。这些制度是坚持下来了，所以县区党委能经常掌握全县党员的思想情况，并使农村支部的经常教育工作得到不断的提高。
    至于总结、检查和奖励方面，也是很经常的。一九五二年进行互助合作教育时，县委曾组织过四次检查（摸底）。第一次发现党员普遍对组织起来缺乏信心，怕吃亏；第二、三次检查发现党员中产生了急躁冒进情绪，已组织起来的互助组很多是形式的；第四次检查，是通过测验了解党员对互助合作政策的认识程度。测验结果说明，大部分党员认识了农村经济的发展方向，自愿互利原则和党员应积极参加并领导互助合作运动的道理。部分村庄成绩不好。如四区中王庄测验了十二个党员，只有一个党员了解农村经济发展的方向，其他只知道是为了解决劳畜力的困难。这四次检查，把组织起来的“底”摸清了，党员思想情况也全部掌握起来。县委把发现的这些思想问题，通过对站长、支部教员的训练并又都贯注到支部教育中去，澄清了党员的一些糊涂思想，推动了互助合作运动的开展。
    今年四月份他们根据地委指示，评选了一次模范站长和模范兼职教员。在全县五十三个站八十七名正副站长里面，评出八名模范站长。县区一百零二名兼职支部教员中，共评选出宋国卿等七名模范教员。这次评选工作，县委在二月份就布置下去。各区、村一面酝酿，接着就展开了站与站、村与村、教员与教员之间的友谊竞赛。这次评选，实际上是对支部教育工作的一个全面检查，那些较落后的村庄有了转变，不大负责的站长和教员也积极起来。评选结果给各区村树立了榜样，把支部教育工作向前推进了一步。上述这些制度的坚持，对支部教育工作的经常化起了一定程度的保证作用，对支部教育的质量的提高，起了一定的推进作用。
    其次，行唐县委认为：党员学习能否搞好的关键，在于各乡、村的支部委员会的核心领导作用。因为，只有支委会发挥了核心领导作用，才能经常地用批评与自我批评的方法推动党员的学习，而支部教育工作的制度，也只有在支部的领导下，由党员民主讨论才能建立和坚持下去。因此，县委就采取了总结和推广典型经验的方法，来加强支部的领导。县委会先后在一九五○年三月和一九五一年十二月，总结了南伏流和南贾素两村开展经常化支部教育工作的典型经验，这些经验的共同的特点是：（一）加强支委会对党员的思想领导，及时表扬学习积极和有成绩的党员，帮助落后党员，批评不好好学习的党员，并将月终的生活检讨会和检查每个人的学习成绩结合起来，使党员学习情绪始终饱满；（二）发动全体党员讨论并订出学习公约，做出决议，大家遵守。两个支部都规定了上课日期，点名、请假、测验、表扬、批评、补课等制度，而且坚持得很好；（三）为了使党员学习养成习惯，固定了上课地址；（四）倾听党员意见，随时改进教学方法。而南贾素村支部的具体作法，是除支委会外还吸收了党员中的骨干分子参加了领导，然后发动党员讨论了关于学习共产党员标准的问题，使多数党员懂得了不学习不能做个好党员的道理。接着支委会又在支部大会上表扬了学习积极分子傅忠信、李福来，批评了不好好学习的贾九书、傅洛方。全体支部委员和学习积极分子又分工负责帮助学习落后的党员。从此以后，党员中再听不见“不学习也能完成工作”的错误说法了。为了使学习情绪能经常巩固下去。经过大家讨论，规定每月二十九日（旧历）开党员大会，用批评与自我批评的方法，检查每个党员的思想、工作和学习。此后，不但学习搞好了，组织生活制度健全了，而且批评与自我批评也展开了。点名、请假、测验、补课等制度以及固定上课地址，都是在发动起党员学习的积极性以后建立与坚持下来的。县委总结并通报了这些经验，当时就发生了很大的影响。目前全县已有一百二十多个支部运用了这些经验，改进了工作，成为了较好的支部，而其他的大部分支部也能够领导支部教育工作，不能领导或不大能领导的只是有数的几个。
    以上是行唐县区党委领导支部教育工作的基本状况和主要经验。当然，行唐县的支部教育工作，还是有它的缺点和值得改进的地方。如当前还有少数支部的教育工作，还没做得很好，甚至没有恢复到划乡前的状态，还需要加强领导，使之走上正常发展的轨道；还有一部分兼职教员不会联系实际或联系得不好，讲课质量不高；划乡后，新配的支部教员有少数不称职，有的不负责任，还需加强对他们的领导，等等。但是，不论如何，行唐县委坚持农村支部的经常教育工作的经验，仍然是值得学习和推广的。
