Xinhua News Agency, December 23rd: The Second National Civil Affairs Conference was held in Beijing from October 22nd to November 13th.  The conference was attended by the heads of civil affairs departments of the administrative committees of the major administrative regions, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and the people's governments of the provinces, centrally administered municipalities, and some prefectural-level cities, as well as representatives from the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government and relevant central departments, totaling 154 people.  The main task of the conference was to summarize the civil affairs work of the past four years and to discuss how civil affairs departments can serve the general line and general tasks of the state during the transition period in the future.

During the conference, Zhu De, Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government, Dong Biwu, Vice Premier of the State Council of the Central People's Government, and Peng Zhen, Deputy Director of the Political and Legal Affairs Committee of the State Council, all attended and delivered speeches.  They elaborated in detail on the general line and general tasks of the state during the transition period and gave important instructions on future civil affairs work.

The conference also invited Soviet expert A. Runev to report on the tasks, organizational structure, and working methods of the Soviet local Soviets, and introduced the experience of Soviet local Soviet regime building.

At the opening of the conference, Xie Juezai, Minister of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government, made a report on the summary of civil affairs work over the past four years and future tasks. He pointed out: Over the past four years, civil affairs departments at all levels have worked actively under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party's organizations at all levels and the people's governments at all levels, and have achieved great results, especially in the construction of the system of people's representative conferences, support for the army and preferential treatment of families, disaster relief, the resolution of many social problems left over from the reactionary rule, and the mobilization of civilian labor.  These works have played a huge role in consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, restoring the national economy, supporting the People's Liberation War, and the struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea.  Minister Xie Juezai also pointed out some deviations and shortcomings in civil affairs work in his report.  For example, in the construction of political power, some cadres did not have sufficient understanding of the important role of the people's representative conferences or people's congresses, and some areas did not convene people's representative conferences or people's congresses on time, and some people's representative conferences became mere formalities.  In terms of preferential treatment, some cadres did not pay enough attention to the families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers, and failed to properly solve their difficult problems.  In rural disaster relief work, some areas had the phenomenon of distributing relief grain and funds without combining it with organizing production or distributing it evenly, and the policy of production for self-rescue and thrift to overcome famine had not been universally implemented.  In the work of receiving and transforming vagrants in cities, many cities have the phenomenon of compulsory reception and transformation regardless of the object.  The emergence of the above deviations and shortcomings is mainly because the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government had unrealistic and general work styles in its guiding ideology in the past, and there was also a phenomenon of decentralism.  After elaborating in detail on the specific tasks of civil affairs work in the future, Minister Xie Juezai emphasized: Civil affairs departments must establish a collective leadership system in the future and conscientiously implement the system of requesting instructions and reporting to the local party and government leaders, strengthen contact with relevant departments, conscientiously follow the mass line, pay attention to investigation and research, and proceed from reality.  All civil affairs workers must strengthen the study of theory and learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union.

At the meeting, Wang Ziyi, Wu Xinzi, and Wang Yifu, Vice Ministers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government, respectively delivered special speeches on the work of grassroots elections and population census, preferential treatment, and disaster relief.

After group discussions and speeches at the meeting, everyone unanimously agreed with the spirit of the various reports and exchanged experiences in civil affairs work in various places.  The conference concentrated all correct and feasible opinions on the basis of fully promoting democracy, and finally adopted the resolution of the Second National Civil Affairs Conference.

The main gain of this conference is, first of all, the clarification of the important position and role of civil affairs work in implementing the general line of the state during the transition period.  After deeply studying the general line of the transition period, the participating representatives unanimously believed that the purpose of the work of political power construction is to further consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, so as to enable the people's democratic regime to better lead and guarantee the country's economic construction, so as to realize the country's socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce.  The purpose of preferential treatment work is to encourage the morale of the people's armed forces and consolidate national defense, so as to defend the motherland and smoothly carry out peaceful construction; at the same time, demobilized and transferred soldiers, revolutionary disabled soldiers who have not completely lost their ability to work, and families of revolutionary martyrs and families of revolutionary soldiers who have full and semi-labor forces are organized into the production front to expand the construction forces of the motherland.  The purpose of doing a good job in relief work, especially rural disaster relief work, is to protect and restore productive forces, ensure the completion of agricultural production plans, and promote the development of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement.  Doing a good job in implementing the Marriage Law is to achieve freedom of marriage, equality of rights between men and women, and family harmony, and thus promote the enthusiasm of young men and women in production.  Doing a good job in population census and registration is to provide reliable population figures for the preparation of national economic construction plans.  Doing a good job in land administration is to adapt to the situation in which China's land will steadily and gradually transition from private ownership to socialist cooperative and collective ownership.  Doing a good job in civilian labor mobilization is to allocate sufficient labor force to the state to meet the needs of national defense construction and economic construction.  In short, all civil affairs work is closely related to the general line, and civil affairs work will still play a major role in the planned economic construction period of the country in the future.

Secondly, the conference arranged specific guidelines for various tasks of civil affairs departments in the future.  The conference believes that in the work of political power construction, the role of cities and industrial and mining areas is increasingly strengthened in realizing the general line of the state during the transition period, and the work of political power construction in cities and industrial and mining areas should be strengthened in the future; the organization and system of grassroots political power in rural areas should also be adapted to the development and needs of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement.  In terms of preferential treatment work, revolutionary martyrs' families, revolutionary soldiers' families, revolutionary disabled soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers with labor force should be organized to participate in agricultural and handicraft mutual aid and cooperation organizations for production.  Relief work, especially rural disaster relief work, should also be combined with the mutual aid and cooperation movement to strengthen the disaster resistance of farmers and implement the policy of production for self-rescue.  In addition, the conference also emphasized: It is necessary to strengthen the ideological leadership of the proletariat in all aspects of the construction of political power, draw a clear line between the ideology of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and thoroughly eliminate the influence of bourgeois old democratic ideology on civil affairs departments.

The conference also clearly stipulated the scope of work of civil affairs departments in the future, which should focus on construction of political power, preferential treatment, and relief as the main businesses, and be in charge of implementing the Marriage Law, population census and registration, land administration, and civilian labor mobilization, etc. Other work that already has competent departments or is closely related to other departments will be transferred to the relevant departments for management according to the nature of the business.

The conference decided that all provinces and cities should convene civil affairs conferences to convey and discuss the various reports and resolutions of this conference, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government and the civil affairs bureaus of the major administrative regions should send people to conduct inspections to ensure that the resolutions of this conference are correctly implemented.

    全国民政会议在京举行
    根据总路线确定民政工作方针
    【新华社二十三日讯】第二次全国民政会议在十月二十二日至十一月十三日在北京举行。出席会议的有各大区行政委员会、内蒙古自治区和各省人民政府、各中央直辖市和部分省辖市人民政府的民政部门负责人，以及中央人民政府内务部和中央各有关部门代表等共一百五十四人。会议主要任务是总结过去四年来的民政工作，并讨论今后民政部门如何为国家过渡时期的总路线总任务服务。
    会议期间，中央人民政府副主席朱德、中央人民政府政务院副总理董必武、政务院政治法律委员会副主任彭真都到会讲话。他们详尽地阐述了国家过渡时期的总路线总任务，并对今后的民政工作作了重要指示。
    会议还邀请苏联专家阿·鲁涅夫报告了关于苏联地方苏维埃的任务、组织机构和工作方法，介绍了苏联地方苏维埃政权建设工作的经验。
    会议开幕时，中央人民政府内务部部长谢觉哉作了关于民政工作四年来的总结和今后任务的报告。他指出：四年来，各级民政部门在中国共产党的各级组织和各级人民政府的领导下积极工作，成绩很大，特别是在人民代表会议制度的建设、拥军优抚、灾荒救济、反动统治遗留下来的许多社会问题的解决和民工动员等方面都作了很多工作，这些工作对于巩固人民民主专政，恢复国民经济，支援人民解放战争和抗美援朝斗争，都起了巨大的作用。谢觉哉部长在报告中也指出了民政工作的一些偏差和缺点。如在政权建设工作方面，有些干部对人民代表会议或人民代表大会的重要作用认识不足，有些地区没有按时召开人民代表会议或人民代表大会，有些人民代表会议流于形式。在优抚工作方面，有些干部对革命烈士家属，革命军人家属，革命残废军人，复员转业军人关心不够，未能负责妥善解决他们的困难问题。在农村救灾工作方面，有些地区存在着发放救济粮款不结合组织生产或平均发放的现象，生产自救、节约渡荒的方针还没有普遍贯彻下去。在城市游民的收容改造工作方面，许多城市发生不分对象强迫收容改造的现象。以上这些偏差和缺点的产生，主要是中央人民政府内务部在领导思想上过去有不切合实际和一般化的作风，并有分散主义现象。谢觉哉部长在详尽地阐述了今后民政工作的具体任务以后强调指出：民政部门今后必须建立集体领导制度和认真执行向当地党政领导请示报告的制度，加强与各有关部门的联系，认真走群众路线，注意调查研究和从实际出发。所有民政工作人员必须加强学习理论和学习苏联先进经验。
    会上，中央人民政府内务部副部长王子宜、武新字、王一夫分别作了关于基层选举工作和人口调查工作，优抚工作以及救灾工作的专题发言。
    会议经过小组讨论，大会发言，一致同意各项报告的精神，并交流了各地民政工作的经验。会议在充分发扬民主的基础上集中了一切正确可行的意见，最后通过了第二次全国民政会议决议。
    这次会议的主要收获，首先是明确了民政工作在贯彻国家过渡时期的总路线中的重要地位和作用。与会代表在深入学习了过渡时期的总路线以后，一致认为：政权建设工作的目的在于进一步巩固以工人阶级为领导、工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政，从而使人民民主政权更好地领导和保障国家经济建设，以实现国家的社会主义工业化及对农业对手工业和对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。优抚工作的目的在于鼓舞人民武装部队的士气和巩固国防，从而保卫祖国顺利地进行和平建设；同时，将复员转业军人、未完全丧失劳动力的革命残废军人以及有整劳动力和半劳动力的革命烈士家属，革命军人家属组织到生产战线中来，以扩大祖国的建设力量。做好救济工作特别是农村救灾工作的目的，在于保护和恢复生产力，保证农业生产计划的完成，并促进农业互助合作运动的发展。做好贯彻婚姻法工作是为了使婚姻自由、男女权利平等、家庭和睦，并从而发扬青年男女在生产上的积极性。做好人口调查登记工作是为了给编制国家经济建设计划提供可靠的人口数字的根据。做好地政工作是为了适应我国土地将由私有制稳步地逐渐过渡到社会主义的合作与集体所有制的这一情况。做好民工动员工作是为了给国家调配足够的劳动力以适应国防建设与经济建设的需要。总之，全部民政工作都与总路线密切相关，民政工作在今后国家有计划的经济建设时期仍然将起着重大的作用。
    其次，会议对今后民政部门的各项工作的具体方针作了安排。会议认为，在政权建设工作方面，由于在实现国家过渡时期总路线中城市的作用日益加强，今后应加强城市和工矿区的政权建设工作；农村基层政权的组织与制度也应使之适应农业互助合作运动的发展和需要。在优抚工作方面，应组织有劳动力的革命烈士家属，革命军人家属，革命残废军人，复员转业军人参加农业和手工业的互助合作组织进行生产。在救济工作特别是农村救灾工作方面，也应与互助合作运动相结合，以加强农民的抗灾力量，贯彻生产自救的方针。此外，会议还着重指出：必须在政权建设的各项工作中加强无产阶级的思想领导，划清无产阶级与资产阶级的思想界限，彻底肃清资产阶级旧民主思想对民政部门的影响。
    会议还明确规定了民政部门今后的工作范围，应以建政、优抚、救济三项为主要业务，并主管贯彻婚姻法、人口调查登记、地政和民工动员等工作，其他已有主管部门或与其他部门关系密切的工作，则按业务性质分别移交由各有关部门管理。
    会议决定各省、市都要召开民政会议，对这次会议的各项报告和决议进行传达和讨论，并由中央人民政府内务部和各大区行政委员会民政局派人进行检查，以保证这次会议的决议得以正确地贯彻执行。
