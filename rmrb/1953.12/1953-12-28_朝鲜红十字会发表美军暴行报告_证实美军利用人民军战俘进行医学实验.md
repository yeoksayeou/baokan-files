Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 27th: The Korean Central News Agency reports that the investigation committee formed by the Korean Red Cross has released an investigation report on the heinous atrocities committed by the American aggressors in conducting medical experiments on Korean People's Army prisoners of war.

The investigation report points out: The investigation committee of the Korean Red Cross consists of Chairman Choi Eung-seok, candidate academician of the Academy of Sciences of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and members Zhu Min-chun, professor of surgery, Kim Seong-jung, physician, Park Byeong-cheol, surgeon, and Seong Ju-yeong, etc. The investigation committee investigated the facts of the American doctors conducting medical experiments on Korean People's Army prisoners of war at the US military's 14th, 14+3, and 64th hospitals based on the oral and written statements of prisoners of war (doctors) Liang Xi-huan, Wu Ben-jia, Jin Ming-jun, Cui Zhong-lie, etc., who had worked in the US military field hospitals, and the statements of prisoners of war who had been persecuted by the US side and are now receiving medical treatment in various hospitals of the Korean People's Army, and prepared this investigation report. The results of the investigation have confirmed the shocking crimes of the American aggressors in using Korean People's Army prisoners of war as experimental subjects, slaughtering many prisoners of war, and turning prisoners of war into disabled persons.

The investigation report lists several typical examples of the crimes of the American aggressors. These examples are:

	At the US military's 14+3 field hospital in Busan, American doctors deliberately perforated the intestines of prisoners of war and then performed surgical experiments, resulting in a mortality rate of 80 percent among these prisoners of war. American doctors performed this type of surgery on three prisoners of war several times, and discharged another five prisoners of war before their wounds had healed, leaving them all disabled.

	Major Mo'a, director of plastic surgery at the 14+3 hospital, deliberately caused a large number of prisoners of war to suffer frostbite in order to carry out heinous surgical experiments such as unwarranted amputations. From January to March 1951 alone, more than 80 prisoners of war were disabled as a result.

	The 14+3 field hospital fabricated excuses to perform unwarranted skull and brain surgery experiments on many prisoners of war such as Jin Zhi-shi, resulting in a mortality rate of more than 50 percent, and those who did not die were also disabled.

	The head of ophthalmology at the 14+3 hospital performed enucleation surgery on prisoners of war who had even slight eye pain. In December 1951 alone, 16 prisoners of war, including Wen Bong-seon, suffered from this type of surgery.

	In December 1950, a US military medical service non-commissioned officer at the second detention center of the 14+3 hospital, in order to conduct experiments, injected prisoners of war with large amounts of typhoid vaccine, causing the prisoners of war to contract extremely severe illnesses, and the US side imprisoned prisoners of war who resisted the injection.

	Major Penny, director of internal medicine at the US military's 14+3 field hospital, and Bailey, the director of the fourth detention center, also used doctors among the prisoners of war to organize spy groups, interrogate and interrogate prisoners of war. After they beat prisoner of war Li Xun-yun to death on February 12, 1952, they also conducted a false diagnosis in an attempt to cover up the truth.

	Biswas, the director of the Busan Headquarters detention center and a US military doctor, used the excuse of sick and wounded prisoners of war singing, and refused to treat more than 500 prisoners of war for 40 days from April 15 to May 25, 1952, resulting in the death of many patients. In the ten days from May 25, he also stopped providing sick and wounded prisoners of war with medicines and food. A few days later, they also used asphyxiating poisonous gas on sick and wounded prisoners of war, causing eight deaths and 241 serious injuries. They also forced sick and wounded prisoners of war with breathing difficulties to walk quickly. At the same time, the US military also stabbed the thighs and buttocks of prisoners of war with bayonets.

	US doctors Captain Mayjian and Captain Solomon sent patients with severe tuberculous meningitis to prison fifteen days after the Korean armistice, allowing the US and Rhee bandit troops to beat them. As a result, three prisoners of war died and many prisoners of war vomited blood. They also forced more than 900 patients with severe tuberculosis to be discharged from the hospital and transferred them to the Geoje Island prisoner of war camp.

	American doctors in the detention center of the 14th field hospital also deliberately allowed infectious diseases (especially dysentery) to spread. As a result, from October 1950 to May 1951, more than 20 people died every day from contracting dysentery. On November 23, 1950, 91 people died in one day. American doctors also compiled seriously ill patients into so-called "control groups" and conducted various drug effectiveness experiments on them after they suffered frostbite and other diseases. In the fourth detention center alone, more than 2,000 people died in seven months due to this experiment. The director of surgery at this field hospital also performed lung surgery experiments on seriously ill patients, causing them to die immediately. Those who resisted were beaten by Syngman Rhee's agents. In the fifth detention center of this hospital, from July 1951 to June 1952, 1,000 tuberculosis patients died as a result of being used as medical experimental subjects.

	In the fifth detention center of the 14+3 hospital, Rhee Syngman's military doctor Lee Yu-kyung used artificial pneumothorax to treat tuberculosis patients and deliberately injured the abdominal aorta, causing the patients to die. When the patients raised objections to this, the detention center authorities stopped treating severe tuberculosis patients for two months, causing 100 patients to die.

	On August 13, 1952, at the second prisoner of war camp on Yongcho Island, the American aggressors threw 1,000 gas bombs at 500 prisoners of war for experimental purposes, causing four prisoners of war to die, more than 350 to suffer severe burns, 44 to lose consciousness, three to lose their hearing, and six to lose their eyesight completely, and no medical treatment was given to the injured afterwards.

	American doctors, for the sake of experimentation, also forced chronic recurrent dysentery patients to undergo artificial anus surgery and subjected the patients to various barbaric tortures.

	In order to make the prisoners of war suffer universally, the American aggressors not only used poison gas, but also used tanks and artillery to fire chemical shells at the prisoners of war. On September 29, 1952, they loaded 24 prisoners of war onto trucks and then threw five chemical grenades, causing these prisoners of war to lose consciousness for 15 to 20 hours.

	On July 2, 1953, Americans in the 11th detention center on Geoje Island, wearing gas masks, conducted intermediate gas poisoning experiments on a prisoner of war, causing him to lose consciousness for two hours and rapidly lose weight in ten to fifteen days.

	The authorities of the 15th detention center on Geoje Island also threw chemical grenades at prisoners of war and fired chemical shells with artillery on March 10, 1953, in order to test the performance of these chemical shells.

The investigation report pointed out in its conclusion: Based on the above irrefutable and conclusive facts, we appeal to kind people and scientists all over the world with the conscience and reputation of scientific workers. Today, conscientious scientists all over the world oppose using scientific achievements to kill human beings; however, the field hospitals and rear hospitals in South Korea under the jurisdiction of the US military are using people as objects of scientific experiments to kill human beings. We, along with kind people all over the world, express our hatred and anger at the heinous atrocities committed by the American aggressors in Korea. In order to prevent the American armed aggressive forces from continuing to repeat such shocking crimes in the future, we solemnly demand that the US military commanders who organized such heinous atrocities and those who executed orders related to such atrocities be punished.

    朝鲜红十字会发表美军暴行报告
    证实美军利用人民军战俘进行医学实验
    【新华社平壤二十七日电】据朝鲜中央通讯社讯：朝鲜红十字会组成的调查委员会发表了关于美国侵略者利用朝鲜人民军战俘进行医学实验的罪恶暴行的调查报告书。
    调查报告书指出：朝鲜红十字会调查委员会由委员长、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国科学院候补院士崔应锡，委员、外科教授朱民淳、内科医师金成仲、外科医师朴秉钦、成柱永等组成。调查委员会根据曾在美军野战医院工作的战俘（医生）梁熙焕、吴本甲、金明俊、崔忠烈等口头和书面的陈述及现在正在朝鲜人民军各医院中医疗的曾遭受美方迫害的战俘的陈述，调查了美方医生在美军第14号、第14＋3和第64号医院利用朝鲜人民军战俘进行医学试验的事实，作成这个调查报告书。调查的结果已证实美国侵略者把朝鲜人民军战俘作为实验对象、屠杀许多战俘、并使战俘变成残废者的各种骇人听闻的罪行。
    调查报告书列举了美国侵略者罪行的几个典型例子。这些例子是：
    在釜山的美军第14＋3号野战医院，美国医生曾故意在战俘的肠子上穿孔，然后做手术实验，使这些战俘的死亡率达到百分之八十。美国医生曾对三个战俘进行这种手术好几次，并使另外五个战俘在伤处没有复原之前就出院，使他们都成了残废者。
    美军第14＋3号医院整形外科主任墨阿少校故意把大批战俘弄成冻伤，对他们进行无故截肢等罪恶的手术实验。在一九五一年一月到三月，即有八十多名战俘因此而变成残废。
    第14＋3号野战医院制造藉口对金致时等很多战俘无故进行头盖骨和脑髓的手术实验，他们的死亡率达到百分之五十以上，没有死的也变成了残废。
    第14＋3号医院眼科主任对眼睛稍有疼痛的战俘即施行摘除眼球的手术。仅在一九五一年十二月里，遭受这种手术之害的就有文奉善等十六名战俘。
    一九五零年十二月，第14＋3号医院第二收容所的美军卫生勤务下士，为了进行实验，给战俘大量注射伤寒病菌苗，使战俘染上极厉害的病，美方并囚禁了反抗注射的战俘。
    美军第14＋3号野战医院内科主任佩尼少校和第四收容所所长贝利并利用战俘中的医生，组织特务集团，拷问和审讯战俘。他们在一九五二年二月十二日打死了战俘李勋云以后，还进行假诊断，企图掩盖真相。
    釜山总部收容所所长、美军医生俾斯威兹藉口病伤战俘唱歌，在一九五二年四月十五日到五月二十五日的四十天中拒绝对五百多名战俘进行治疗，因而有许多患者死亡。在从五月二十五日起的十天中，他还停止供给病伤战俘以药品和食物。几天以后，他们并对病伤战俘使用了窒息性的毒气，使八人死亡，二百四十一人严重受伤。他们还强迫呼吸困难的病伤战俘快步行走。同时，美军还以刺刀刺入战俘的大腿和臀部。
    美国医生梅见大尉和所罗门大尉在朝鲜停战后的第十五天，还把严重结核性脑膜炎患者送到监狱去，让美李匪军去殴打。结果，三名战俘死亡，许多战俘吐血。他们并强迫九百多名严重结核病患者出院，把他们移送到巨济岛战俘营去。
    美国医生在第14号野战医院收容所中，并故意使传染病（特别是赤痢）蔓延开来。结果，从一九五零年十月到一九五一年五月，每天因染上赤痢而死亡的有二十人以上。一九五零年十一月二十三日一天中，就有九十一人死亡。美国医生还把重患者编成所谓“对照群”，使他们在遭受冻伤和其他病症后，对他们进行各种药品的效果实验。仅在第四收容所中，在七个月中就有二千多人由于这种实验而死亡。这个野战医院外科主任并对重患者施行肺手术实验，使他们当即死亡。有些人抗拒，便遭到了李承晚特务的毒打。在这个医院第五收容所中，从一九五一年七月到一九五二年六月，有一千名结核病患者因为作为医学实验对象而死亡。
    在第14＋3号医院第五收容所中，李承晚军医李玉景用人工气腹法来进行对结核病患者的治疗，并故意使腹腔大动脉受伤，使患者死亡。患者们对此提出意见，收容所当局竟对重结核病患者停止治疗两个月，使一百名患者死亡。
      一九五二年八月十三日在龙草岛第二战俘营，美国侵略者为了进行实验的目的，向五百名战俘投掷了一千颗毒气弹，使四名战俘死亡，三百五十多名受严重火伤，四十四名丧失意识，三名丧失听力，六名完全丧失视力，以后也没有给伤者以任何医疗。
    美国医生为了实验，还对慢性再发性的赤痢患者强迫进行人工肛门手术，并对患者施行各种野蛮的拷打。
    为了使战俘普遍受害，美国侵略者不但使用毒气，而且还用坦克和大炮向战俘发射化学弹。一九五二年九月二十九日，他们把二十四名战俘装上卡车，然后投掷五颗化学手榴弹，使这些战俘在十五小时至二十小时中丧失了意识。
    一九五三年七月二日，巨济岛第十一号收容所中的美国人带着防毒口罩，对一名战俘进行中瓦斯毒实验，使他失去知觉两小时，并在十天至十五天以后体重迅速减轻。
    巨济岛第十五号收容所当局，在一九五三年三月十日也向战俘投掷了化学手榴弹，并用炮发射化学弹，以实验这些化学弹的性能。
    调查报告书在结论中指出：根据上述不可辩驳的确凿事实，我们以科学工作者的良心和名誉，向全世界善良的人们和科学界人士呼吁。今天，全世界有良心的科学工作者都反对把科学的成就用来杀害人类；但是，美军管辖下的南朝鲜各野战医院和后方医院却利用人作为杀害人类的科学实验的对象。我们和全世界善良的人们一道，对美国侵略者在朝鲜制造的这种罪恶暴行表示憎恶和愤怒。为了制止美国武装侵略势力在今后继续重演这种骇人听闻的罪行，我们严正地要求惩处组织这种罪恶暴行的美军指挥官及执行有关这种暴行的命令的人。
