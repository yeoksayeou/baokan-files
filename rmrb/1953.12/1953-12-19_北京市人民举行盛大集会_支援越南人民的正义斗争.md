Xinhua News Agency: A grand rally of the people of Beijing in support of the Vietnamese people's struggle was held on the evening of the 18th at the Youth Palace. Attending the rally were representatives from various people's organizations in the capital, including the Beijing Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, as well as over a thousand people from all walks of life in the capital, including workers, women, youth, students, cultural figures, and cadres from government agencies.

    Invited to attend the rally were Le Dinh Tham, Chairman of the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace, and Nguyen Xuan Thuy, General Secretary, who were passing through Beijing on their way back home after attending the Vienna meeting of the World Peace Council.

    Zhou Liang, Charge d'Affaires of the Embassy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in China, embassy staff, and many Vietnamese nationals residing in Beijing were also invited to attend the rally.

    Also invited to attend the rally were Kaneko Kenta, representative of the All-Japan Congress of Industrial Unions at the Asia-Australia Liaison Bureau of the World Federation of Trade Unions, and trade union representatives from Indonesia and other countries who are currently visiting China, as well as Japanese farmer representatives Kubota Yutaka, Hamano Kiyoshi, and Otani Yasushi.

    Also invited to attend the rally were Wan Tu-le-li, Deputy Secretary-General of the Asian and Pacific Regions Peace Liaison Committee, and others.

    The rally was presided over by Liu Laifu, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions. He first delivered an opening speech, saying: We, all the workers of Beijing, together with all the people of Beijing, warmly respond to the call of the World Federation of Trade Unions, and it is of great significance that we are holding this rally today to support the Day of Struggle of the Vietnamese People. We, the workers and people of Beijing, resolutely oppose the French and American imperialist aggression against the Vietnamese people. We, together with the people of the whole country and all peace-loving people of the world, resolutely support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people and resolutely demand an end to the Vietnam War and a peaceful solution to the Vietnam issue.

    Following this, Liu Ningyi, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, spoke (full text to be published separately).

    Le Dinh Tham, Chairman of the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace, was invited to speak at the meeting (full text to be published separately).

    Liu Guan-yi, Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, Qian Sanqiang, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, Xu Guangping, Vice Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, and Yang Hansheng, Secretary-General of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, also spoke successively.

    Liu Guan-yi, on behalf of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, expressed full support for the just struggle of the Vietnamese people. He said: The Vietnamese people, like the Chinese people, are peace-loving. President Ho Chi Minh, the leader of the Vietnamese people, recently expressed the peaceful aspirations of the Vietnamese people in answering questions from the editor-in-chief of the Swedish "Expressen." The Chinese people will, as in the past, make our greatest efforts to support the Vietnamese people's struggle to defend national independence and to strive for a ceasefire and a peaceful solution to the Vietnam issue.

    Qian Sanqiang, on behalf of the Chinese youth, paid tribute to the heroic Vietnamese people and youth. He said: Chinese youth have always been concerned about and paying attention to the struggle and victory of the Vietnamese people and youth, and are inspired by the heroic struggle and heroic model deeds of the Vietnamese people and youth. We believe that the Vietnamese people, with the support of the peace-loving people of all countries, will surely achieve victory.

    In her speech, Xu Guangping conveyed the infinite concern of Chinese women for all the Vietnamese people, especially for the Vietnamese sisters who are suffering deeply from the war and fighting heroically. She said: At present, women throughout our country are actively participating in the construction of the motherland and are striving to complete and over fulfill the first five-year economic construction plan of the motherland. We are supporting the struggle of the Vietnamese people with such practical actions.

    Yang Hansheng, after speaking about the great victories achieved by the Vietnamese people under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh and the Vietnam Workers' Party, said: This victory, as a Vietnamese poet said, is a spring built by the Vietnamese people with their blood and flesh. Today, although the French aggressors and American interventionists have suffered great defeats, they are not reconciled and are planning to further collude to continue their aggression. We, the Chinese people, must, together with the peace-loving people of the world, resolutely support the Vietnamese brothers in carrying on their patriotic struggle to the final victory.

    Finally, film actor Li Keng recited the poem "A Hanoian's Song" written by the famous Vietnamese poet Nguyen Dinh Thi.

    After the meeting, the Vietnamese large-scale news documentary "The Great Victory in the Northwest" was shown.

    大会由北京市总工会副主席刘莱夫主持。他首先致开会词说：我们北京全体工人和北京的全体人民一起，热烈响应世界工会联合会的号召，今天在这里举行支援越南人民斗争日的大会，这是有很重大的意义的。我们北京的工人和人民坚决反对法、美帝国主义侵略越南人民，我们和全国人民以及全世界一切爱好和平的人民一道，坚决支援越南人民的正义斗争，坚决要求停止越南战争，并以和平方式解决越南问题。
    接着，中华全国总工会副主席刘宁一讲话（全文另发）。

    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会秘书长刘贯一、中华全国民主青年联合会副主席钱三强、中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席许广平、中国文学艺术界联合会秘书长阳翰笙相继讲话。
    刘贯一在会上代表中国人民保卫世界和平委员会表示全力支援越南人民的正义斗争。他说：越南人民也同中国人民一样是热爱和平的。越南人民领袖胡志明主席最近在答复瑞典“快报”主编问时，已经表达了越南人民的和平愿望。中国人民将和过去一样，为支持越南人民保卫民族独立的斗争，为争取越南停战与和平解决越南问题而尽我们最大的努力。
