    Educating Party Members by Comparing Two Paths
    The Party Organization of Getiaogang Township, Changli County, Hebei Province, Achieves Good Results in Publicizing the General Line

    The General Branch Committee of the Communist Party of China in Getiaogang Township, Changli County, Hebei Province, used vivid and concrete examples to educate all Party members in the township, enabling them to understand the Party's general line during the transition period.

    Starting from November 13th, the township Party general branch gathered thirty Party members from five natural villages in the township to convey the Party's general line during the transition period and led them in discussions. During the discussions, due to limitations in their political understanding, only some Party members initially understood that the state's implementation of socialist transformation in agriculture meant guiding farmers to organize and take the socialist road. However, their understanding of why this was necessary was not very concrete or profound.

    In response to this situation, the work team of the Tangshan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, together with the township Party general branch, decided to use specific comparisons between advanced and backward villages in mutual aid and cooperation within the township. This aimed to help everyone recognize the benefits of organizing, the harm of spontaneous capitalist forces in the countryside, clarify ideological boundaries, and resolutely lead farmers to organize and take the socialist road.

    Jieguanying in Getiaogang Township is an advanced village in terms of mutual aid and cooperation. It began organizing in 1951, and now the entire village has eighteen year-round mutual aid teams, organizing a total of 246 households, accounting for 72.4% of the total households in the village. As a result of organizing, grain production has significantly increased. Last year, the average yield of sorghum increased from 110 jin per mu in 1950 to 172 jin; the average yield of corn increased from 203 jin per mu to 337.5 jin. In total, the village increased grain production by more than 490,000 jin last year, an increase of 33% compared to normal years. 115 poor peasant households have risen to become middle peasants, and only 18 poor peasant households remain. At the same time, due to the implementation of mutual assistance, the phenomenon of usury exploitation has been eliminated. Last year, there was one household lending money at high interest rates and two households selling land; this year, there were no such phenomena. This autumn, due to heavy rainfall, forty rooms in fifteen farmers' houses collapsed. Mutual aid team members and the masses helped each other with labor and materials, and the difficulties of building houses were all resolved. Furthermore, although the village suffered a flood this year, grain production still exceeded that of ordinary villages. The entire village has 96 households with surplus grain, totaling approximately 130,000 jin.

    Getiaogang Village, on the other hand, is a backward village in terms of mutual aid and cooperation. The entire village has 246 households and 3,998 mu of land. Currently, there is only one mutual aid team in the village, with only three households participating. 99% of the households are not organized. Although production has improved somewhat in the village since the land reform, class differentiation quickly occurred because the farmers did not organize and take the road of mutual aid and cooperation. For example, farmer Yang Zhenxiang in the village has a family of seven, with only two people participating in labor. Yang Zhenxiang made huge profits by speculating and reselling livestock. Last year, he bought ten and a half rooms and four mu of land. Since then, the entire Yang family has stopped participating in labor and relies solely on hiring short-term laborers to cultivate the land. Another example is Wang Fengjun, who engages in speculative trading. Last autumn, he used 10 million yuan (old currency) to buy 18.5 mu of land and six rooms. In this way, he jumped to become a rich peasant. Another segment of farmers saw their lives decline due to usury exploitation and other reasons. For example, poor peasant Xu Shouqing borrowed 500,000 yuan from Xu Jingzhang at a monthly interest rate of 8%. Ten months later, in order to repay the debt, Xu Shouqing sold all 1,100 jin of grain he harvested; his family's life became even more difficult. Some farmers sold their land and houses due to a lack of money. For example, farmer Xu Shaoqing sold all four and two-tenths mu of land he was allocated. To date, on the one hand, 19 households in the village have bought 62 rooms, 27 households have bought 117.4 mu of land, and 15 households are lending money at high interest rates (monthly interest rates of 8% to 12%); on the other hand, 56 households have sold their houses and land, including three households that have sold all their houses and property. Looking at the overall increase in production in the village, it also lags behind Jieguanying. Due to low investment and poor processing, only 81,500 jin of grain was increased last year, an increase of only 11% compared to normal years.

    The above two examples deeply educated the Party members, making them see clearly the two paths of rural economic development. After being educated, the six Party members in Getiaogang Village examined their past erroneous ideas of neglecting and relaxing leadership in mutual aid and cooperation, and expressed their determination to take the socialist road. They said that after returning to the village, they would educate the farmers to organize and actively lead the work of the mutual aid teams. Party member Xu Dongchang said: "Taking the capitalist road means a small number of people getting rich and the majority suffering; taking the socialist road means everyone becoming prosperous. This time, I have truly recognized the two paths." Party member Bai Xilian from Jieguanying excitedly said: "Originally, I thought that after the land reform, everyone had been allocated houses and land, and there shouldn't be any problems! Who knew that the problem was not that simple. Now, I realize that going it alone is a dead end." Other Party members also unanimously expressed: they would continue to consolidate and expand the mutual aid teams, striving to have all laboring farmers in the village participate; the Liu Yongzhang mutual aid team, which is in better condition, is preparing to transition to an agricultural production cooperative next spring.

    After all Party members clearly distinguished the boundaries between the two paths, they deeply understood the content of the general line, especially the necessity of the state implementing socialist transformation of agriculture, and had a clearer understanding.

    On the basis of improving the Party members' thinking, they were guided to deeply discuss the grain issue. The work team and the Party general branch continued to improve everyone's ideological awareness by calculating accounts carefully, recalling the past, and making comparisons, criticizing the erroneous idea of some Party members that "selling surplus grain to the state only benefits grain-deficient households and is a loss for surplus-grain households." During the discussion, the price situation before and after liberation was compared, making everyone realize the importance of the state controlling grain. In addition, facts were cited such as workers supplying farmers with new farm tools, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides, increasing grain production, and improving farmers' lives day by day, making everyone realize that if grain is not sold to the state but to unscrupulous merchants, the state will have less grain in its hands, and unscrupulous merchants will take the opportunity to raise grain prices, and industrial products will also fluctuate accordingly. At that time, not only will the country's industrial construction be affected and the worker-peasant alliance be destroyed, which will be unfavorable to the entire people, but surplus-grain households will not gain any advantage. In this way, all Party members realized the rationale for selling surplus grain to the state, and also recognized the consistency of individual interests with national interests, and the consistency of current interests with long-term interests. Seven Party members with surplus grain from Jieguanying, Getiaogang Village, and Zhangguanzhuang Village expressed on the spot that they would sell all their surplus grain to the state and would use this method of calculating accounts carefully to educate the masses.

    用实例来对比两条道路教育党员
    河北省昌黎县葛条港乡党组织宣传总路线收到的效果很好
    中共河北省昌黎县葛条港乡总支委员会用生动的具体事例，教育全乡党员，使他们领会党在过渡时期的总路线。
    十一月十三日起，该乡党总支集中全乡五个自然村的三十个党员，传达了党在过渡时期的总路线，并领导他们进行了讨论。在讨论中，由于政治水平的限制，只有一部分党员初步了解国家对农业实行社会主义改造，就是要引导农民组织起来走社会主义的道路。但为什么要这样，大家的体会还很不具体、不深刻。
    针对这种情况，中共唐山地委工作队就同乡党总支进行研究，决定通过本乡互助合作先进村与落后村的具体比较，使大家认识组织起来的好处、农村资本主义自发势力的危害性，使大家划清思想界限，坚决领导农民组织起来，走社会主义的道路。
    葛条港乡的解官营，在互助合作方面是个先进村。一九五一年开始组织起来，到现在全村共有十八个长年互助组，组织起来的农户共二百四十六户，占全村总户数的百分之七十二点四。由于组织起来的结果，粮食产量显著提高，去年高粱由一九五○年每亩平均产量一百一十斤，增加到一百七十二斤；苞米由每亩平均产二百零三斤增加到三百三十七斤半。总计去年全村增产粮食四十九万多斤，较常年产量增加百分之三十三。全村已有一百一十五户贫农上升为中农，现只剩下十八户贫农。同时由于实行了互助互济，消灭了高利贷剥削的现象。去年有一户放高利贷，两户出卖土地，今年就没有这种现象了。今秋雨水多，十五户农民倒塌房子四十间，互助组组员便和群众互助、帮工、借料，盖房的困难全都给解决了。又该村今年虽遭受了水灾，粮食产量仍超过一般的村子，全村九十六户余粮户，共有余粮约十三万斤。
    至于葛条港村，在互助合作方面则是一个落后村，全村共二百四十六户，有土地三千九百九十八亩。现在全村只有一个互助组，参加互助组的只有三户，百分之九十九的人家没有组织起来。该村在土地改革以后，生产虽有所提高，但由于农民没有组织起来走互助合作的道路，很快就发生了阶级分化的现象。如该村农民杨振祥，全家共七口人，参加劳动的只有两人。杨振祥因投机倒把，贩卖牲畜，获得暴利，去年买了十间半房和四亩土地。从此，杨家全家都不参加劳动了，专门靠雇短工种地。又如王凤君，从事投机买卖，去年秋天他用人民币一千万元买地十八亩半，买房六间。这样，他便一跃而成为富农。另外一部分农民，由于受到别人的高利贷剥削以及其他原因，生活下降了。如该村贫农许守庆因向许景章借了五十万元，月利八分，十个月以后，许守庆为了还债，把打下的一千一百斤粮食全部卖出去；他家的生活便显得更困难了。有些农民因为缺钱，把土地房屋卖掉。如农民许绍青将分到的四亩二分地全部卖光。到目前为止，该村一方面有十九户买房六十二间，二十七户买地一百一十七亩四分，十五户放高利贷（月利八分至十二分）；另一方面有五十六户则卖房卖地，其中三户把房、地产都卖光了。就全村的增产情况来看，也落后于解官营。由于投资少，加工差，去年只增产了八万一千五百斤粮食，只较常年产量增加百分之十一。
    上面两个例子，深深地教育了党员，使他们看清了农村经济发展的两条道路。葛条港村的六个党员经教育以后，检查了过去忽视和放松互助合作领导的错误思想，表示坚决走社会主义的道路，回村后要教育农民组织起来，积极领导互助组的工作。党员许东昌说：“走资本主义的路，少数人发财致富，多数人受穷吃苦；走社会主义的路，大家富裕。这回可真使我认清了两条道路了。”解官营党员白锡连激动地说：“原来我以为经过土地改革，大家分了房子、土地，该没啥差错啦！那知道问题并不这样简单。现在，我认识到单干是没有出路的。”其他党员也一致表示：要继续巩固与扩大互助组，争取全村劳动农民都参加进来；条件较好的刘永章互助组，准备明春转入农业生产合作社。
    全体党员划清了两条道路的界限之后，就深刻地领会了总路线的内容，特别是关于国家对农业实行社会主义改造的必要性，有了更明确的认识。
    在党员的思想有了提高的基础上，引导大家深入讨论了粮食问题。工作组和党总支通过算细账、回忆、对比的方式，来继续提高大家的思想觉悟，批判部分党员中“把余粮卖给国家，只对缺粮户有利，对余粮户是吃亏”的错误想法。在讨论中，对比了解放前和解放后的物价情况，使大家认识到国家掌握粮食的重要性。此外，还列举了解放前一斗高粱只能换大布四尺，现在却能换一丈二尺，以及工人供给农民新式农具、化学肥料和农药，增产了粮食，使农民生活日益改善等事实，使大家认识到，如果不把粮食卖给国家而卖给奸商，国家手中的粮食少了，奸商就会趁机抬高粮价，工业品也就要跟着波动起来。那时，不仅会使国家的工业建设受到影响，破坏工农联盟，对全体人民不利，余粮户也占不了什么便宜。这样就使全体党员认识了把余粮卖给国家的道理，也认识到个人利益与国家利益的一致性，目前利益与长远利益的一致性。解官营、葛条港村、张官庄的七名有余粮的党员当场表示要把自己的全部余粮卖给国家，并要以这种算细账的办法去教育群众。  （田润民）
