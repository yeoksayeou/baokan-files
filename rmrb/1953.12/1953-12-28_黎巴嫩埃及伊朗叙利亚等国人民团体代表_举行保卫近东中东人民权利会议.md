Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, 25th -- Tass reported from Beirut on the 23rd: The Lebanese National Peace Committee issued a statement on the Conference to Defend the Rights of the People of the Near East and Middle East held in Beirut on December 19th. The statement said, "The national, political, economic, and cultural lives of the people of the Near East and Middle East are under increasing pressure from imperialist countries." Due to this situation, "various national organizations in these countries, despite differing political views and beliefs, have had to come together to discuss ways to avoid common dangers, which constantly threaten the national interests of these people and could drag them into adventures against their interests. This has given rise to the demand for a conference to defend the rights of the people of these countries."

The statement said that Lebanese representative Dr. George Hanna, in his opening speech, emphasized the great historical significance of the first such conference in the region. He spoke in detail about the struggle of the people of the Near East and Middle East against imperialism and its insatiable demands. He concluded, "The victories already achieved by the forces of peace and freedom, and the even greater victories to be achieved in the future, foreshadow that if we continue our struggle, we will surely achieve victory."

Egyptian representative Ibrahim Rashad said that the Egyptian delegation was composed of people with different political views and religious beliefs. He said he felt it was his duty to insist that British troops must withdraw from the Suez Canal Zone, "because they represent not only a threat to the Egyptian people, but also to all anti-imperialist fighters in the Near East, Middle East, and African countries."

Iranian representative Professor Nafisi of the Iranian Academy of Sciences, spoke to the delegates about the struggle of the Iranian people for the nationalization of the Iranian oil industry and against new imperialist conspiracies attempting to undo the achievements of the Iranian people in this regard.

Syrian representative Munir Rais said that the Syrian people must fight against all imperialist conspiracies aimed at dragging Syria into military blocs in which Syria has no interest. He pointed out that the unity of the people of the Near East and Middle East is the guarantee of victory in their struggle for peace and independence.

Iraqi representative Kazim El Samarrai said that the Iraqi people are oppressed and exploited by imperialists and their agents. He believes that the struggle of the Iraqi people and the people of the Near East and Middle East for liberation will surely be victorious.

Transjordanian representative and member of parliament Abdul Qader Salih described the plight of the people of Transjordan, which is occupied by Britain and whose internal affairs are interfered with by the United States. He assured the conference that the people of Transjordan believe they will achieve victory and support the people of all Arab countries and the people of all countries in the world who are fighting for national liberation and defending national sovereignty.

The last to speak was Saudi Arabian representative Abdullah El Sali. He said that because imperialists exploit the rich oil fields of his country, the people of Saudi Arabia live in poverty, hunger, and ignorance. He said that the people of Saudi Arabia will welcome and support all resolutions passed by this conference for the benefit of the people of the Near East and Middle East.

The conference then unanimously adopted a declaration and elected an executive committee to implement the resolutions adopted.

Resolutions of the Conference to Defend the Rights of the People of the Near East and Middle East

Declaration of the Conference to Defend the Rights of the People of the Near East and Middle East

Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, 25th -- Tass reported from Beirut on the 23rd: The Lebanese National Peace Committee issued the declaration adopted by the Conference to Defend the Rights of the People of the Near East and Middle East held in Beirut on December 19th.

The declaration said: "The people of the Near East and Middle East live in the same conditions, face the same dangers and the same problems, which requires them to work together to carry out the struggle to defend national interests."

The declaration said that the representatives of various political views participating in the conference came to the conclusion that the people of the Near East and Middle East "are threatened by the same imperialist plan aimed at dragging our countries into adventures that violate the interests of our people. This conspiracy deepens international tensions and threatens world peace. Among these conspiracies, the most dangerous are the plan to establish a common defense system, the alliance between Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, Iraq, and the United States, and open or hidden plans such as Truman's 'Point Four Program' and the 'Johnston Plan.'"

"Unjust treaties that have been forced upon the people of some of our countries are still being implemented. These treaties violate the independence and national sovereignty of the people of the Near East and Middle East. Foreign troops continue to occupy military bases in North Africa, Libya, Egypt, Transjordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and other parts of the Arabian Peninsula, threatening the security of the Near East and Middle East."

The declaration said that the people of the Near East and Middle East are under increasing pressure from imperialist countries, which want to force these people to accept unequal bilateral treaties, extort privileges from them, intensify interference in their internal affairs, hinder their development of trade, paralyze the economy of the Near East and Middle East, and systematically plunder the natural resources of the Near East and Middle East.

The participants in the conference unanimously agreed: "The Palestinian issue is the result of imperialist manipulation, and the resolution of this issue is closely related to ending this manipulation."

The delegations from Transjordan, Iran, Syria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, and Egypt, with the support of the people of North Africa and the people of the Persian Gulf, reached an agreement and unanimously agreed that it is necessary to strengthen cooperation and jointly carry out the struggle to meet the requirements of the conference.

The declaration concluded: "These demands will be supported by all honest people in the world, because the national independence of the people is a guarantee of peace, and peace is what our people in the Near East and Middle East and the people of the world demand."

    黎巴嫩埃及伊朗叙利亚等国人民团体代表
    举行保卫近东中东人民权利会议
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社贝鲁特二十三日讯：黎巴嫩全国和平委员会就十二月十九日在贝鲁特召开的保卫近东中东人民权利会议发表了公告。公告说，“近东中东各国人民的民族、政治、经济和文化生活受到帝国主义国家的越来越大的压力”。由于这种情况，“这些国家的各种全国性团体，尽管政治见解和信仰不同，都不得不共同来讨论避免共同危险的方法，这种危险经常威胁着这些人民的民族利益，并可能把他们拖入违反他们利益的冒险行动中去。这就产生了召开保卫这些国家的人民权利的会议的要求。”
    公告说，黎巴嫩代表乔治·汉纳博士在开幕词中，着重指出了这个地区的第一次这样的会议的重大历史意义。他详细地谈到近东中东各国人民为反对帝国主义及其贪得无厌的要求而进行的斗争。他最后说：“和平与自由的力量已经取得的胜利以及将来还要取得的更大的胜利预示着，如果我们继续进行我们的斗争，我们就一定会取得胜利。”
    埃及代表易卜拉欣·赖沙德说，埃及代表团是由具有不同政治见解和宗教信仰的人们组成的。他说，他认为他有责任坚持英国军队必须从苏彝士运河区撤退，“因为他们不但意味着对埃及人的威胁，而且也意味着对近东、中东和非洲各国一切反对帝国主义的战士的威胁。”
    伊朗代表、伊朗科学院院士纳菲西教授，向代表们谈到了伊朗人民为伊朗石油工业国有化、为反对帝国主义企图取消伊朗人民在这方面的成就的新阴谋而进行的斗争。
    叙利亚代表穆尼尔·拉伊斯说，叙利亚人民要为反对目的在于把叙利亚拖进叙利亚并不感兴趣的军事集团的一切帝国主义阴谋而斗争。他指出，近东中东人民的团结一致，是他们争取和平与独立的斗争获得胜利的保证。
    伊拉克代表卡齐姆·艾尔·萨马威说，伊拉克人民受到帝国主义者和他们的代理人的压迫和剥削。他相信伊拉克人民和近东中东各国人民争取解放的斗争一定会取得胜利。
    外约旦代表国会议员阿卜杜勒·卡德尔·萨利叙述了被英国占领并且内政受到美国干涉的外约旦人民所处的困境。他向会议保证，外约旦人民相信他们会取得胜利，并且支持为争取民族解放和保卫国家主权而斗争的一切阿拉伯国家的人民和世界各国人民。
    最后发言的是沙特阿拉伯代表阿卜杜拉·艾尔·萨利。他说，由于帝国主义者开采他的国家的富饶的油田，沙特阿拉伯人民过着贫困、饥饿与愚昧的生活。他说，沙特阿拉伯人民将欢迎并支持这个会议为了近东中东人民的利益所通过的一切决议。
    会议然后一致通过了宣言，并选出一个执行委员会来执行通过的决议。
    保卫近东中东人民权利会议的决议
    【新华社二十三日讯】据塔斯社贝鲁特二十二日讯：保卫近东中东人民权利会议于十九日在贝鲁特举行。会议作出了如下决议：
      （一）不和任何一国或任何一群国家缔结侵犯我们的主权并可能把我们拖入军事冒险的条约或任何军事协定。反对威胁我们人民安全的帝国主义军事集团；
    （二）废除所有侵犯我们的国家主权和民族独立、阻挠我们利用祖国的资源和天然财富的军事、政治、经济条约和协定以及文化关系方面的协定；
    （三）争取使外国军队撤离我们的国家，决不让他们再回来；
    （四）支持并援助为争取英军撤离苏彝士运河区而斗争的埃及人民，因为英军留驻在那里不仅威胁着埃及人民，而且威胁着所有的近东中东人民以及整个世界的安全；
    （五）结束帝国主义对我们的经济生活的控制，解放我们的资源和民族财富，利用它们来提高我们自己人民的生活水平。拒绝在我们国内利用帝国主义资本；
      （六）废除根据杜鲁门“第四点计划”和类似的奴役援助计划提供援助的协定，这些计划已经证明是帝国主义建设军事基地和成立侵略集团的计划所不可缺少的部分；拒绝美国或其他帝国主义国家的一切援助；
      （七）要求阿拉伯国家的政府和人民在解决巴勒斯坦问题及其有关问题时不要和帝国主义者合作；
      （八）支持并援助摩洛哥、阿尔及利亚、突尼斯和阿拉伯半岛南部地区国家的人民进行反对帝国主义的斗争；
      （九）支持并援助伊朗人民，对那些企图掠夺伊朗的石油资源并取消石油工业国有化决定的帝国主义阴谋分子进行斗争；
      （十）在平等与互利的基础上，和世界各国建立并扩大贸易和经济关系，不管它们的政治制度如何；
      （十一）发扬民族文化，毫无例外地促进并扩大与世界各国的文化交流，……为反对帝国主义对我们文化的影响而斗争，解放并保卫我们的文化，使它不受帝国主义的影响；
    （十二）把我们人民的民族斗争和正在非洲、亚洲以及全世界对帝国主义进行斗争的各国人民的民族斗争，以及各国的一切反对帝国主义运动联系起来。要求联合国尊重各国人民的独立和安全，以及他们决定自己命运的权利；也要求联合国接纳所有真正具有代表人民的政府的国家为会员国；
      （十三）争取以协商的和平方式解决国际冲突，争取各民族的主权和独立受到尊重，以便缓和国际紧张局势；
    （十四）成立保卫近东中东人民权利会议执行委员会来宣传并执行这些决议，并负责筹备和召开具有代表性的人民会议来继续这次会议已经开始了的工作。
    保卫近东中东人民权利会议的宣言
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社贝鲁特二十三日讯：黎巴嫩全国和平委员会发表了十二月十九日在贝鲁特举行的保卫近东中东人民权利会议通过的宣言。
    宣言说：“近东中东各国人民生活在同样的情况下，面对着同一个危险和同样的问题，这要求他们共同努力来进行保卫民族利益的斗争。”
    宣言说，参加这次会议的具有各种政治见解的代表得到了结论，认为近东中东各国人民“受到目的在于把我们国家拉进违反我们人民的利益的冒险中去的同一个帝国主义计划的威胁。这种阴谋加深了国际紧张局势，威胁了世界和平。这些阴谋中，危险性最大的是成立一个共同防御体系的计划，及巴基斯坦、伊朗、土耳其、伊拉克各国与美国之间的同盟，以及像杜鲁门‘第四点计划’、‘约翰斯顿计划’之类的公开或隐蔽的计划。
    强迫我们中间某些国家的人民接受的不公正的条约现在还在实施着。这些条约侵犯了近东中东各国人民的独立与国家主权。外国军队继续在北非、利比亚、埃及、外约旦、伊拉克、沙特阿拉伯与阿拉伯半岛的其他地区，占领着军事基地，威胁着近东中东的安全。”
    宣言说，近东中东各国人民正受到帝国主义国家日益加重的压力，这些帝国主义国家想强迫这些人民接受不平等的双边条约，向他们勒索特权，加紧干涉他们的内政，阻碍他们发展贸易，使近东中东的经济陷于瘫痪，并有计划地掠夺近东中东的天然资源。
    参加会议的人一致认为：“巴勒斯坦问题是帝国主义操纵的结果，这个问题的解决和结束这种操纵有密切的关系。”
    参加会议的外约旦、伊朗、叙利亚、伊拉克、沙特阿拉伯、黎巴嫩和埃及代表团在北非人民和波斯湾人民的支持下达成了协议，一致认为有必要加强合作，共同进行争取满足会议的要求的斗争。
    宣言最后说：“这些要求将得到全世界一切正直人民的支持，因为人民的民族独立是和平的保证，而和平是我们近东中东人民和全世界人民所要求的。”
