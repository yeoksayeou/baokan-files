The lies of the U.S. government cannot cover up the atrocities of the U.S. military
    Hua Bei Christian Joint Committee General Secretary, Chairman of the Yenching Union Theological Seminary Board, Wang Zizhong

    Anyone who has seen the "Investigation Report on Atrocities of U.S. Military Against Prisoners of War" recently published by the Chinese Red Cross cannot help but be filled with righteous indignation at the brutal acts of U.S. imperialism. From this report, we have a clearer understanding of why the U.S. representative had to propose a report in the United Nations that slandered the Korean and Chinese forces for committing "atrocities" against "UN" prisoners of war. As Mr. Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, pointed out: One of the purposes of the U.S. delegation's slanderous proposal is to divert world public opinion from condemning U.S. military atrocities, attempting to confuse the world's attention.

    The atrocities of the U.S. imperialist army in Korea have long been impossible to conceal. The U.S. Air Force brutally bombed peaceful cities and villages in Korea, whether it was churches, hospitals, schools, or cultural relics; we saw this with our own eyes. U.S. troops carried out massacres of Korean women and children and abused prisoners of war, even U.S. news agencies themselves admitted it long ago. As the saying goes, "A guilty conscience needs no accuser," so U.S. imperialism had to resort to the low tactic of lying, fabricating the so-called "atrocities" of the Korean and Chinese side out of thin air, attempting to cover up its own crimes. However, in doing so, U.S. imperialism shot itself in the foot, further exposing its war crimes, because facts speak louder than lies, and deception can never wash away guilt.

    The fact that the Korean and Chinese forces treat prisoners of war with leniency cannot be denied by the U.S. because this is something that the U.S. prisoners of war have personally experienced and confirmed. I remember U.S. Air Force prisoner of war, Second Lieutenant Richard G. Vass, talked about his experience after being captured. Vass said, "Due to the flames caused by my plane crashing, my hands, face, and knees were severely burned. I lost consciousness upon landing, but the Chinese troops who captured me transported me to a bunker at a safe distance from the front line to treat my wounds. I regained consciousness in this bunker. The troops I had just bombed and strafed gave me food, water, cigarettes, and even a magazine to read. I was treated very well here. After staying at the front for three days, I was transferred further north by truck and finally stopped at a Chinese hospital. I stayed in this hospital for almost a month and received first-class care from the doctors and nurses. I am especially grateful for this, because without first-class treatment and care, my burns would have resulted in terrible scars, but now my face is exactly the same as before, without scars, and I don't feel any adverse effects from the injury." Who can believe that the Korean and Chinese forces, who treat prisoners of war with such a high degree of humanitarianism and carefully treat sick and wounded prisoners of war, "mistreat" prisoners of war?

    However, the U.S. imperialist army treats prisoners of war in the complete opposite manner. Two reports from the Chinese Red Cross tell us that U.S. troops are constantly killing prisoners of war in the battlefield and in the rear, subjecting prisoners of war to various tortures and physical and mental abuse. They used various appalling abuses against sick and wounded prisoners of war, causing many prisoners of war to die, and turning many who should not have been disabled into disabled people. This is such a stark contrast; one side implements humanitarian treatment of prisoners of war, while the other side inflicts inhumane abuse on prisoners of war.

    No wonder people all over the world have reacted coldly to the U.S.'s lying propaganda. As Pastor Johnson said not long ago in refuting the "Yorkshire Post's" help in covering up U.S. germ warfare crimes, "Truth itself has power, and it will eventually be recognized by people."

    In this sharp struggle between good and evil, kind people all over the world should be vigilant, recognize the facts, recognize the truth, and not be deceived by U.S. lies. Our peace-loving people must unite more closely to further expose the U.S.'s conspiracies and crimes so that its tricks to endanger world peace cannot succeed.

    美国政府的谎言掩盖不了美军的暴行
    华北基督教联合会总干事  燕京协和神学院院务委员会主席  王梓仲
    凡是看见了中国红十字会最近发表的“美军虐杀战俘暴行调查报告书”的，没有一个人能够不对美帝国主义的残暴行为义愤填膺的。从这个报告中，我们更加清楚地了解到，美国代表为什么要在联合国提出一个诬蔑朝中部队对“联合国军”战俘施行“暴行”的报告。正如中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若先生所指出的：美国代表团提出诽谤提案，其目的之一，是为了转移世界舆论对美军暴行的谴责，企图以此混淆世界的视听。
    美帝国主义军队在朝鲜的暴行，本是早就无法掩饰的了。美国空军残暴地轰炸朝鲜的和平城市和乡村，无论是教堂、医院、学校、文化古迹，这是我们亲眼看见了的。美国军队集体屠杀朝鲜的妇孺，虐杀战俘，连美方自己的通讯社早也承认了。俗语说：“贼人胆虚”，因此美帝国主义不得不采取说谎的下策，凭空捏造朝中方面所谓“暴行”的谎话，企图以此掩盖自己的罪恶。但是，美帝国主义这样做，却是弄巧成拙，反而更加暴露了自己的战争罪行，因为事实胜于谎言，欺骗绝对不能洗清罪责。
    朝中军队宽待战俘的事实，是美国诬蔑不了的。因为这是美方战俘已经亲身体验、亲口证实了的。我记得美国空军战俘理查·格·瓦斯少尉说过他自己被俘后的经历。瓦斯说：“由于我的飞机撞毁所引起的火焰，使我的双手、脸部和膝部受到了严重的烧伤。我在着陆时失去了知觉，但俘获我的中国部队把我运到距火线有一段安全距离的一个地堡中，治疗我的创伤。在此地堡中我恢复了知觉。我刚才轰炸扫射过的部队给我食物、饮水、香烟、甚至一本杂志阅读。在此我受到非常好的待遇。在前方呆了三天以后，我被用卡车再向北转送，最后在一个中国医院中停下来。我在此医院中住了几乎一个月，受到医生和护士的头等照顾。我对这点特别感激，因为若不是有头等的治疗和照顾，我的灼伤就会招致可怕的疤痕，但现在我的脸部和原先一模一样没有疤痕，也没有感到受伤后的不良后果。”这样地用崇高的人道主义精神对待战俘，细心地治疗伤病战俘的朝中部队，说他们“虐待”战俘，有谁能相信呢？
    但是，美帝国主义军队对待战俘却完全与此相反。中国红十字会的两个报告书告诉我们，美国军队在战地和后方，都是不断地屠杀战俘，对战俘施行各种酷刑和肉体的与精神的虐待。他们对待病伤战俘，更施用了各种惨不忍闻的虐待，使许多战俘死亡，使许多不该残废的人变成了残废。这是多么鲜明的对比，一方对战俘实施人道待遇，另一方对战俘却施以非人的虐待。
    无怪乎全世界人民对美国的撒谎宣传反应冷淡。正如约翰逊教长不久以前在驳斥“约克郡邮报”帮助美国掩饰细菌战罪行时所说的：“真理本身具有力量，并且终将为人们所认识。”
    全世界的善良人们在这种善与恶的尖锐斗争中应该提高警惕，认识事实，认识真理，不受美国谎言的欺骗。我们爱好和平的人民要更加团结起来，进一步揭发美国的阴谋与罪行，使它的危害世界和平的诡计不能得逞。
