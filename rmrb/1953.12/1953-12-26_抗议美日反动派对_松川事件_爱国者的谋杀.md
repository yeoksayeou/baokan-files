    Protest Against the Murder of "Matsukawa Incident" Patriots by U.S.-Japan Reactionaries
    Ignoring the strong opposition of the Japanese people and world public opinion, the U.S.-Japan reactionaries brazenly instructed the Sendai High Court of Japan on December 22nd to fabricate charges and sentence the vast majority of innocent defendants to death and long-term imprisonment in the second trial of the "Matsukawa Incident." This is a barbaric murder of the Japanese people for peace by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, and an ugly reenactment of the American "Rosenberg Case" in Japan.
    Countless facts revealed over the past four years have proven that the arrest of twenty Japanese patriots by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries for manufacturing the "Matsukawa Train Derailment Incident" in August 1949 was a completely framed-up illegal act and a despicable political conspiracy. The Fukushima District Court of Japan conducted 94 trials of the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident," and the Sendai High Court conducted 110 trials, but they could not produce any evidence sufficient to constitute a crime by the defendants. They actually used a less than one-foot-long wrench, which was not found at the scene of the incident but in a nearby rice paddy, as the only physical evidence to sentence the defendants to death and long-term imprisonment. This is truly absurd. The "Accident Report" of the Fukushima Management Bureau of the Japan National Railways also proves that "it is impossible for a wrench to loosen the track spikes tightened with over 100 tons of force and cause the train to derail." The Japanese bourgeois newspaper "Yomiuri Shimbun" had to admit on October 6th that "the original judgment (referring to the first trial judgment of the Fukushima District Court) is now untenable." Under such circumstances, the fascist verdict of the Sendai High Court of Japan, which actually maintained the barbaric verdict of the first trial, is clearly a deliberate attempt to obliterate the truth, frame Japanese patriots, and destroy the basic democratic rights of the Japanese people.
    Recently, the Yoshida reactionary government, in order to clear the way for large-scale rearmament, is carrying out a series of provocative conspiracies against the patriotic Japanese people who oppose rearmament and demand peace and democracy. It dispatched armed police to beat patriotic students in Kyoto, searched for Japanese representatives attending the Fourth World Youth and Student Festival for Peace and Friendship, searched the offices of the Japanese Communist Party's organ "Akahata," and arrested staff members of "Akahata" and the "Japan National Relief Association." The fascist verdict of the Sendai High Court on the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" instructed by the Yoshida reactionary government is precisely for the same sinister purpose, so it is not an isolated event.
    However, the U.S.-Japan reactionaries' frenzied attack on the Japanese people will not only fail to frustrate the Japanese people's struggle for independence, peace, and democracy, but will also make the Japanese people's strength more united and stronger. Over the past few years, in order to rescue the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident," the Japanese people have launched mass protest movements involving broad strata, with more than six million people signing petitions demanding the restoration of the innocent defendants' freedom.
    The heroic struggle of the twenty innocent defendants has written a moving and glorious page in the history of the Japanese people's struggle for democratic rights and freedom. In their "Letter to the Japanese People from All Defendants in the Matsukawa Incident," they solemnly wrote: "We are about to be massacred for the sake of Japan's independence, peace, and freedom. We have been sentenced to death on trumped-up charges... But we believe that world peace will eventually be achieved through the efforts of all people. We are convinced that truth will prevail and will fight for it to the last breath." This noble quality and great spirit of defending the truth and loving peace and freedom has won the sympathy and respect of all righteous people in the world, and will encourage the vast Japanese people to unite more closely and exert greater strength in the struggle for independence, peace, and democracy.
    The Chinese people and the people of the world will continue to firmly support the Japanese people's just struggle to rescue the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident," resolutely protest the unwarranted verdict of the Yoshida reactionary government of Japan, and demand the immediate restoration of freedom to all innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident."

### 抗议美日反动派对“松川事件”爱国者的谋杀

    抗议美日反动派对“松川事件”爱国者的谋杀
    美日反动派悍然不顾日本人民和世界舆论的强烈反对，于十二月二十二日指使日本仙台高等裁判所在“松川事件”第二审判决中，捏造罪名判处绝大多数无辜被告以死刑和长期徒刑。这是美日反动派对日本和平人民的野蛮谋杀，是丑恶的美国“罗森堡事件”在日本的重演。
    四年多来所揭露出来的无数事实证明，一九四九年八月间美日反动派制造“松川火车出轨事件”逮捕二十名日本爱国者，完全是诬陷性质的非法行为和卑鄙的政治阴谋。日本福岛地方裁判所对“松川事件”无辜被告进行了九十四次审讯，仙台高等裁判所进行了一百一十次审讯，都提不出丝毫足以构成被告犯罪的证据来。他们竟将并非在出事现场发现而是在附近稻田中找到的一把长不足一尺的螺丝钳子当作唯一的物证，就对被告判处死刑和长期徒刑，这真是荒谬绝伦的。日本国营铁道公司福岛管理局的“事故报告书”也证明：“一把螺丝钳子是不可能拔动用百余吨力量压紧的道钉而使列车出轨的。”日本资产阶级报纸“读卖新闻”，在十月六日也不得不承认：“现在，原判（指福岛地方裁判所第一审的判决）已站不住脚了。”在这样的情况下，日本仙台高等裁判所在实际上维持了第一审的野蛮判决，显然是蓄意抹煞真理，陷害日本爱国者，摧残日本人民基本民主权利的法西斯暴行。
    最近以来，吉田反动政府为了给大规模重整军备扫清道路，正对反对重整军备、要求和平民主的日本爱国人民进行一系列的挑衅阴谋。它出动武装警察殴打京都的爱国学生，搜捕出席第四届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节的日本代表，搜查日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”社，并逮捕“赤旗报”和“日本国民救援会”的工作人员。吉田反动政府指使仙台高等裁判所对“松川事件”无辜被告的法西斯判决，也正是为了同样的阴险目的，因此它不是一个孤立的事件。
    但是，美日反动派对日本人民的疯狂进攻，不仅不能挫败日本人民争取独立、和平与民主的斗争，而且使日本人民的力量更加团结和强大起来。几年来，为了营救“松川事件”无辜被告，日本人民展开了包括广泛阶层的群众抗议运动，有六百多万人签名要求恢复无辜被告们的自由。
    二十名无辜被告的英勇斗争，更在日本人民争取民主权利和自由的历史上写下了可歌可泣的光辉一页。他们在“松川事件全体被告告日本人民书”中庄严地写道：“我们为了争取日本的独立、和平与自由，将要被残杀了。我们被以莫须有的罪名判处了死刑。……但是我们相信世界和平终将由全体人民的努力而获得。我们确信真理一定胜利，并将为此斗争到最后一息。”这种为保卫真理、热爱和平自由的坚贞不屈的高贵品质和伟大精神，获得了全世界一切正义人民的同情和尊敬，并将鼓励着日本广大人民在争取独立、和平与民主的斗争中更紧密地团结起来，发挥出更伟大的力量。
    中国人民和全世界人民将继续坚决支持日本人民营救“松川事件”无辜被告的正义斗争，坚决抗议日本吉田反动政府蛮横无理的判决，并要求立即恢复“松川事件”全体无辜被告的自由。
