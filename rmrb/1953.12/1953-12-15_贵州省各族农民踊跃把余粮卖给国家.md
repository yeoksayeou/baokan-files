    Guizhou Province's Farmers of All Ethnic Groups Enthusiastically Sell Surplus Grain to the State
    Guizhou Province's farmers of all ethnic groups are enthusiastically selling their surplus grain to the state to support national construction.
    This year, Guizhou has seen a general bumper harvest of grain across all regions. In the remote, high-altitude mountain areas, minority farmers, under the leadership and assistance of the Communist Party and the People's Government, have initially changed their farming methods from "slash-and-burn" and "extensive planting with low yields," resulting in an increase in grain production of about seven percent compared to last year. Most minority farmers have surplus grain this year. Since the autumn harvest, farmers from all seventy-two ethnic minorities in the province have been continuously selling their surplus grain to the state. The Buyi farmers in Ceheng, Wangmo, Sandu, Luodian, and over ten other counties, where the harvest came earlier, have been selling new grains like rice and paddy to the state since late August while simultaneously carrying out the autumn harvest. In the Bijie Special District, a remote high-altitude mountain area, farmers of Miao, Han, Yi, Hui, and other ethnic groups were selling five to six hundred thousand jin of grain to the state every day, even before the autumn harvest ended in early October. In October and November, with the autumn harvest completely finished throughout the province, the amount of grain sold by farmers of all ethnic groups has been increasing daily. Currently, the amount of grain purchased daily throughout the province has reached over four million jin.
    In the grain purchasing process, the CCP committees and government departments in various parts of Guizhou generally conducted political and ideological education for minority farmers, based on local conditions and ethnic characteristics. State grain purchasing cadres in Bijie, Duyun, Fuquan, Guiding, and other counties used opportunities such as market days and selling goods to publicize to farmers of all ethnic groups the significance of selling surplus grain to the state for supporting national construction and ensuring price stability. Some minority cadres and farmers in Zhenyuan, Lushan, and other counties, who had visited factories and state-owned farms in Beijing, Chongqing, or Guiyang, used the facts they had witnessed to conduct propaganda and education among farmers about the worker-peasant alliance and the socialist path. Duyun County, through minority cadres and leaders of various ethnic groups, publicized to farmers of all ethnic groups the benefits of selling surplus grain to the state, both for the country and for themselves. Driven by their example, farmers of all ethnic groups in the county have been selling four to five hundred thousand jin of surplus grain to the state every day.
    To take care of the interests of farmers of all ethnic groups, the Guizhou Provincial People's Government's Department of Commerce reasonably adjusted the price differences between industrial and agricultural products when it started purchasing grain. The sales prices of industrial products were generally reduced, with major commodities such as cotton cloth and general merchandise generally reduced by one to two point six percent compared to last year. At the same time, the prices of major grains were generally increased by about ten percent compared to last year. In some minority border mountain areas where grain prices were particularly low in the past, prices were even increased by about twenty percent. This has greatly increased the actual income of farmers of all ethnic groups.
    State-owned commercial departments and cooperatives in various parts of Guizhou, in coordination with the grain purchasing work, vigorously organized sources of goods to supply the means of production and means of livelihood needed by farmers of all ethnic groups. The sales plans of state-owned commercial departments and ethnic trade companies throughout the province for the second half of the year have been increased by thirty percent compared to the original figures. Minority trade cadres in the Leishan County ethnic store also organized peddlers to go deep into the border villages to supply goods. (Shao Bin)

    贵州省各族农民踊跃把余粮卖给国家
    贵州省各族农民踊跃把余粮卖给国家，支持国家建设。
    今年，贵州各地粮食普遍丰收；各边沿高寒山区的少数民族农民，在共产党和人民政府领导、扶助下，由于初步改变了“刀耕火种”、“广种薄收”的耕作方法，粮食产量也比去年增加百分之七左右。少数民族农民今年大都有了余粮。秋收以来，全省七十二个少数民族的农民，不断向国家出售余粮。收获较早的册亨、望谟、三都、罗甸等十余县的布依族农民，从八月下旬以来，一面进行秋收，一面向国家出售稻谷、大米等新粮。在边沿高寒山区的毕节专区，苗、汉、彝、回等族农民，当十月初秋收还没有结束的时候，每天就把五、六十万斤粮食卖给国家。十月、十一月，全省秋收全部结束，各族农民售粮数量日益增加。目前，全省每日购粮数量达四百万斤以上。
    贵州各地中共党委和政府部门在购粮中，一般都根据各地具体情况和民族特点，对少数民族农民进行了政治思想教育。毕节、都匀、福泉、贵定等县国家购粮干部，利用赶场、卖货等机会，向各族农民宣传了把余粮卖给国家对支持国家建设和保证物价稳定等方面的意义。镇远、炉山等县有些曾到北京、重庆或贵阳参观过工厂、国营农场的少数民族干部和农民，用亲眼看到的事实，对农民进行了工农联盟和社会主义道路的宣传教育。都匀县通过少数民族干部和各少数民族领袖人物，向各族农民宣传了把余粮卖给国家对国家和自己的好处。在他们的带动下，该县各族农民每日卖给国家的余粮，达四、五万斤。
    为了照顾各民族农民的利益，在开始收购粮食时，贵州省人民政府商业厅合理调整了工农业产品的差价。工业品销售价格普遍降低，其中棉布、百货等主要商品，一般都比去年降低了百分之一到百分之二点六。同时，主要粮食价格一般都比去年提高了百分之十左右；过去粮价特别低的少数民族边沿山区，有的甚至提高了百分之二十左右。这就大大增加了各族农民的实际收入。
    贵州各地国营商业部门和合作社，配合购粮工作，大力组织货源，供应各族农民需要的生产资料和生活资料。全省各国营商业部门和民族贸易公司下半年的销售计划，比原订数额增加了百分之三十。雷山县民族商店的少数民族贸易干部还组织货郎担，深入各边沿村寨供应货物。　（绍宾）
