After the Northwest region began to promote the general line to farmers and strengthened economic work, the total grain procurement in the region in November increased by 30.03% compared to October.

After hearing the propaganda and education on the general line, farmers in various parts of Northwest China realized that selling surplus grain to the state is a glorious task to support national construction. In particular, farmers who participated in agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups took the lead in selling large quantities of surplus grain to the state. The More Ru Xin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Pingluo County, Ningxia Province, unanimously agreed to sell more than 15,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. The Jiao Jia Zhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yongchang County, Gansu Province, unanimously decided to sell all of its surplus grain to the state. The sixth production team of this cooperative alone sold 5,500 jin of surplus grain and 3,800 jin of oilseeds. Since November, farmers in various parts of Northwest China have been enthusiastically selling grain to the state. Farmers in Liangjiabao Village, Zhouzhi County, Shaanxi Province, sold 72 dan of surplus grain to the state in the second half of November alone. After understanding the general line of the state during the transition period, Hui and Han farmers in Yaoquan Township, Huangzhong County, Qinghai Province, sold 408,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. Under the leadership of activists, farmers in Pujin Township, Jiuquan County, Gansu Province, held family meetings to discuss preparations for expanding grain production next year, and the whole village sold more than 66,000 jin of surplus grain to the state.

The enthusiastic sale of surplus grain to the state by farmers in various parts of Northwest China has打击 [dǎ jī - cracked down on] the behavior of some illegal grain merchants in intercepting and purchasing grain. When farmers in the fifth district and fifth township of Huinong County, Ningxia Province, collectively sold grain to the Huangquqiao Town Cooperative, some illegal private merchants harassed and intercepted them along the way, but were sternly rejected by the farmers. When farmer Qi Zhengfa from Tangba Township, Huzhu County, Qinghai Province, entered the city to sell grain, illegal grain merchants blocked the road and tempted him to buy grain, Qi Zhengfa said: "No matter what, I will sell the grain to the state and never to you profiteers." He transported the grain to the city and sold it to the purchasing and marketing station of the state-owned grain company. (Xinhua News Agency)

    西北各地农民把大批粮食卖给国家
    西北区开始向农民进行总路线的宣传教育同时加强了经济工作后，十一月份全区粮食收购总量比十月份增加了百分之三十点零三。
    西北各地农民在听到总路线的宣传教育后，认识到把余粮卖给国家是支援国家建设的光荣任务，尤其是参加农业生产合作社和互助组的农民们，首先将大批余粮卖给国家。宁夏省平罗县莫如信农业生产合作社全社一百二十七人一致通过把一万五千多斤余粮卖给国家。甘肃省永昌县焦家庄农业生产合作社全社二百六十四户农民一致决定把全部余粮卖给国家。仅这个合作社第六生产小组，就卖出余粮五千五百斤和油籽三千八百斤。十一月份以来，西北各地农民向国家出售的粮食更加踊跃。陕西省盩厔县梁家堡村农民在十一月份下半月内就卖给国家余粮七十二市担。青海省湟中县药泉乡回、汉农民在懂得了国家过渡时期的总路线后，出卖余粮四十万八千斤给国家。甘肃酒泉县蒲金乡农民在积极分子带动下分别召开了家庭会议，讨论了扩大明年粮食增产的准备工作，全村把余粮六万六千多斤，卖给国家。
    西北各地农民踊跃地向国家出售余粮，打击了一些不法粮商截购套购的行为。宁夏省惠农县五区五乡农民集体向黄渠桥镇合作社售粮时，有些不法私商在沿途缠绕截购，都遭到了农民的严词拒绝。青海省互助县唐巴乡农民齐正发进城售粮时，不法粮商拦路引诱套购，齐正发说：“无论如何我也要把粮食卖给国家，绝不卖给你们这些奸商。”他一直把粮食运进城，卖给国营粮食公司的购销站。（新华社）
