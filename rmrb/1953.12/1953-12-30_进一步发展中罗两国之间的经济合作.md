    Further Development of Economic Cooperation Between China and Romania
    By Yang Ku'en,
    Minister of Foreign Trade of the Romanian People's Republic

    The people of Romania are very pleased to see the achievements of the Chinese people, achievements obtained under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, with the selfless and fraternal help of the great Soviet Union, and in close cooperation with the people's democracies of Europe and Asia. The Chinese people are now transforming their country from a backward agricultural country into a powerful country with a strong industry and agriculture.

    The achievements of the Chinese people encourage all peace-loving nations around the world, giving them new confidence and strength. The strength and consolidation of the Soviet Union, People's China, and the people's democracies further assure all peace-loving people around the world of the inevitable victory of the cause of peace.

    After successfully completing the restoration of the national economy during the period of 1950-1952, the Chinese people are now enthusiastically striving to achieve the goals of the first Five-Year Plan. The goals of this Five-Year Plan are to industrialize China, raise the level of agricultural production, and continuously improve the material and cultural well-being of the people.

    After restoring and developing China's industry, making the output of major industrial sectors exceed the highest levels before liberation, and after implementing land reform, distributing nearly 47 million hectares of land formerly belonging to landlords to farmers, the Chinese people's government has created the necessary conditions for transitioning to planned economic construction.

    The achievements of the Chinese people in restoring the national economy have led to the rapid development of China's trade relations with other countries. Like the national economies of other people's democracies, the national economy of People's China has the necessity and the possibility to strengthen trade relations with the countries of the democratic camp.

    Mutual assistance and a sincere desire to seek common economic prosperity are the main characteristics of the relations between countries in the democratic camp. Under this principle, the great People's Republic of China and the Romanian People's Republic are doing their utmost to develop the new world market.

    Close economic cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, as well as between China and the people's democracies, has been established and is developing. They promote the consolidation of the new world market, which is continuing to develop despite all the obstacles of American imperialism.

    Economic cooperation between the People's Republic of China and the Romanian People's Republic has developed into a part of the new socialist type of relations between countries in the democratic camp. This relationship is one of sincere friendship and economic, cultural, and political cooperation. It is a relationship of equality and mutual assistance. Trade between the People's Republic of China and Romania is carried out for the common development of the national economies of both countries. The natural resources of the two countries can complement each other, and trade between them will promote their economic development and improve the welfare of their people. Trade between our two countries, like trade between countries in the great camp of peace and socialism, is conducted at fair prices agreed upon by both parties, based on respect for each other's interests. Moreover, these prices are converted using the world's most stable currency—the Soviet ruble.

    The economic cooperation between the great People's Republic of China and our country is built and developed on these principles. In 1938, there was almost no trade relationship between China and Romania. In 1938, Romania imported fifteen tons of goods from China, while there were no exports to China at all. In 1937, Romania's total exports to China were no more than ten tons. Since 1951, trade between the two countries has increased year by year, which has made a great contribution to the consolidation of both economies.

    In 1951, a series of contracts were signed, stipulating that our country would supply China with petroleum products and obtain minerals such as tungsten, tin, and antimony from China.

    At the beginning of 1952, we organized trade between the two countries according to a bilateral agreement to expand import and export volumes. The agreement signed in Bucharest on July 30, 1952, stipulated that the trade volume between the People's Republic of China and the Romanian People's Republic would increase by a total of 644 percent compared to the previous year. Our country imported tin, antimony, vegetable oil, tea, and other goods from China, while supplying China with petroleum products (oil, paraffin, ointments, vaseline), drilling equipment, and motors.

    After the agreement signed in Beijing on January 19, 1953, trade between Romania and China progressed greatly in the same year.

    In 1953, the trade volume between China and Romania increased almost sevenfold compared to 1952, and more than fortyfold compared to 1951.

    The number of imported and exported goods has also increased. The Romanian People's Republic supplies China with petroleum products, oil extraction equipment—including drilling rigs, transport vehicles, pumps, winches, internal combustion engines, various tools, and drilling rig parts—as well as ball bearings, chemical raw materials, cotton textiles, and paper. China supplies our country with tin, antimony, iron ore, vegetable oil, cotton, rubber, hemp, jute, silk fabrics, pepper, tea, and so on.

    With the economic achievements of both countries, the amount of barter trade between China and Romania will further increase in 1954.

    Trade between the People's Republic of China and the Romanian People's Republic will play an increasingly important role in the economic life of both countries.

    The Chinese and Romanian people, who are working hard to complete their economic plans, will create more mutually beneficial trade opportunities to strengthen the national economies of our countries and improve the living standards of our people.

    We must emphasize the exemplary accuracy and sincerity of the People's Republic of China in fulfilling its commercial obligations. China's foreign trade agencies consider it their duty to overcome all difficulties and deliver the goods we ordered in a timely and complete manner in accordance with the contracts. This is a great help to our planned economy and is one reason why we are willing to trade with the great China.

    This year's Sino-Romanian economic cooperation has begun to manifest itself in new and more important forms. On October 15th of this year, the protocol of the first session of the Joint Sino-Romanian Committee for Scientific and Technological Cooperation was signed in Bucharest. It stipulates that the exchange of experiences between scientists, technicians, and workers will be organized between our two countries.

    The development of economic cooperation with the great People's Republic of China is very important to the national economy of the Romanian People's Republic. The mineral ores supplied by China are extremely necessary for the development of our country's steel industry. In addition, China's flax, hemp, jute, cotton, silk fabrics, and food help us to complete the task stipulated in the resolution passed by the August Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, which requires a large increase in the necessities of life for residents.

    Similarly, China also needs equipment produced by our country's machine-building industry. Our country's machine-building industry is now able to export a variety of tools and machines, especially oil extraction equipment and chemical industry equipment.

    The increasingly close economic relations between our country and the great People's Republic of China demonstrate the lasting friendship between the peoples of our two countries. This economic relationship demonstrates fraternal cooperation aimed at continuously improving the material and cultural welfare of our people. This proves that distance cannot become an obstacle to the sincere desire for cooperation. The new development of Sino-Romanian economic cooperation contributes to the planned development of the national economies of the countries of the democratic camp, to the consolidation of the camp of peace and socialism, and to the strengthening of peace and international cooperation.

    进一步发展中罗两国之间的经济合作
    罗马尼亚人民共和国
    对外贸易部部长  扬·库恩
    罗马尼亚人民十分高兴地看到中国人民的成就，这些成就是在中国共产党与中央人民政府的领导之下，在伟大苏联的无私的与兄弟般的帮助之下和与欧亚人民民主国家的密切合作之下取得的，中国人民现在正在把自己的国家从一个落后的农业国转变为拥有巨大的工业和农业的强国。
    中国人民的成就鼓舞了全世界所有爱好和平的民族，给它们以新的信心和力量。苏联、人民中国和各人民民主国家的强大与巩固，使全世界所有爱好和平的人民更加确信和平事业的必然胜利。
    中国人民在一九五○—一九五二年期间顺利地完成了国民经济的恢复工作以后，现在正在满怀热情地为达到第一个五年计划的目标而奋斗。这个五年计划的目标是使中国工业化，提高农业生产水平，以便不断地增进人民的物质与文化福利。
    在恢复与发展了中国的工业，使工业各主要部门的产量都超过了解放前最高水平以后，在实行了土地改革，把从前属于地主所有的近四千七百万公顷土地分给农民以后，中国人民政权就为转入计划经济的建设创造了必需的条件。
    中国人民在恢复国民经济中所取得的成就，使得中国与其他国家贸易关系有了迅速的发展。人民中国的国民经济和其他人民民主国家的经济一样，有着加强与民主阵营各国贸易关系的必要性与可能性。
    互相帮助与谋求经济的共同高涨的真诚愿望，是民主阵营各国之间关系的主要特征。在这一原则之下，伟大的中华人民共和国与罗马尼亚人民共和国都在为了新的世界市场的发展而尽自己的最大努力。
    中国与苏联以及中国与各人民民主国家之间的密切的经济合作关系已经建立起来和正在发展着。它们促进了新的世界市场的巩固，这个世界市场不顾美帝国主义的一切阻挠正在继续不断地发展着。
    中华人民共和国与罗马尼亚人民共和国之间的经济合作，已发展成为民主阵营各国之间的新的社会主义型的关系的一部分。这种关系是真诚的友谊和经济、文化、政治合作的关系。它是平等互助的关系。中华人民共和国与罗马尼亚之间的贸易，是为了两国国民经济的共同发展而进行的。两国的自然资源是可以互相取长补短的，它们之间的贸易将促进它们经济的发展与提高它们人民的福利。我们两国之间的贸易，与伟大的和平与社会主义阵营各国之间的贸易一样是在双方同意的公平价格上，在尊重双方利益的基础上成交的。而且这种价格是以世界上最稳定的货币——苏联卢布来折算的。
    伟大的中华人民共和国和我国间的经济合作就是在这些原则之上建立和发展起来的。在一九三八年时，中罗两国间几乎没有贸易关系。一九三八年罗马尼亚由中国进口十五吨货物，而对中国则没有任何的输出。一九三七年罗马尼亚对中国输出的货物总共也不过十吨。自从一九五一年以来，两国间的贸易逐年增加，这对双方经济的巩固有着很大的贡献。
    一九五一年签订了一系列的合同，规定我国以石油产品供应中国，并从中国取得钨、锡和锑等矿石。
    一九五二年初，根据扩大进出口额的双边协定的规定，我们组织了两国间的贸易。一九五二年七月三十日在布加勒斯特签订的协定，规定将使中华人民共和国和罗马尼亚人民共和国之间的贸易额要比上一年总共增加百分之六百四十四。我国由中国进口锡、锑、菜油、茶叶和其他货物，同时供应中国以石油产品（石油、石蜡、软膏、凡士林）、钻探设备与电动机等。
    一九五三年一月十九日在北京签订了协定后，同年罗中贸易又大大地向前进展了。
    在一九五三年，中国和罗马尼亚之间的贸易额比一九五二年几乎增加七倍，而比一九五一年增加了四十倍多。
    进出口货物的数目也有所增加。罗马尼亚人民共和国供给中国石油产品、采油装备——包括钻探机、运送车、抽水机、绞盘、内燃机、各种工具和钻探机零件等，此外还有滚珠轴承、化学原料、棉织品和纸张等等。中国供给我国锡、锑、铁矿、植物油、棉花、橡胶、大麻、黄麻、丝织品、胡椒、茶叶等等。
    随着两国经济上的成就，中国和罗马尼亚间的易货数量在一九五四年内将有进一步的增加。
    中华人民共和国和罗马尼亚人民共和国间的贸易，将在两国经济生活中发生日益重要的作用。
    正在为完成经济计划而加紧努力的中国人民和罗马尼亚人民，将要为加强我们国家的国民经济和提高人民生活水平而创造出更多的互利贸易的机会。
    我们必须着重指出中华人民共和国在完成它所承担的商业义务时的可作典范的准确与诚意。中国的对外贸易机构认为，克服一切困难，把我们所订购的货物及时地、完整地根据合同交货，是他们应尽的责任。这对我们的计划经济是一个非常的帮助，也是我们愿意和伟大的中国进行贸易的一个理由。
    今年度的罗中经济合作，已经开始以新的、更重要的形式表现出来了。今年十月十五日，罗中科学与技术合作联合委员会第一届会议议定书在布加勒斯特签订了。它规定了将在我们两国之间组织科学家、技术人员和工人间的经验交流。
    和伟大的中华人民共和国的经济合作的发展，对于罗马尼亚人民共和国的国民经济是十分重要的。中国方面供给我们的矿砂，是为我国钢铁工业的发展所极端需要的。此外，中国的亚麻、大麻、黄麻和棉花，丝织品与食物则有助于我们去完成罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会八月全会所通过的必须大量增加居民必需品的决议所规定的任务。
    同样地，中国也需要由我国机器制造工业所出产的装备。我国的机器制造工业现在已经能够输出各种各样的工具和机器，特别是采油装备和化学工业装备等等。
    我国与伟大的中华人民共和国之间日益密切的经济关系，表现了我们两国人民间的持久友谊。这种经济关系表现了旨在不断提高我们人民的物质与文化福利的兄弟般的合作。这证明了：遥远的距离并不能成为合作的真诚愿望的阻碍。中罗经济合作的新的发展，有助于民主阵营各国国民经济的有计划发展，有助于和平与社会主义阵营的巩固，有助于和平与国际合作的加强。
