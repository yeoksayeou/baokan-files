A highly mechanized and automated large steel rolling mill

A key factory in China's First Five-Year Plan, a large steel rolling mill, has been completed. This is China's first large-scale steel rolling mill with the most advanced technology and equipment. With this factory, China will be able to manufacture its own heavy steel rails, various large steel materials, including I-beams, channel steel, angle steel, square steel, round steel, and other shaped steel, large beams for cranes, seamless steel pipe blanks, and keels for ships and warships.

When we think of steel rolling mills, we often imagine workers toiling under high temperatures in outdated facilities. Beside the heating furnaces and rolling mills, red-hot steel billets and gigantic, serpent-like steel materials are flipped and moved up and down, all by manual labor. A moment's carelessness, a slight delay in eye or hand, could result in burns. Smoke and heat torment the workers' health. Such scenes will no longer be seen in the new large steel rolling mill. The Soviet Union has supplied China with the most advanced equipment and designed a highly mechanized and automated factory for us according to the latest technical standards. From receiving steel billets to the finished product leaving the warehouse, the large steel rolling mill requires very little manual labor; most tasks are done with mechanized tools powered by electricity. Some sections are even completely automated; the complex production process of an entire section, from start to finish, proceeds automatically, one process after another.

The products of the large steel rolling mill, from raw materials to finished products, go through four sections: billet section, heating section, rolling section, and finishing section. The process of rolling a steel billet into a steel rail will be described below.

Red-hot steel billets are sent from the rough rolling mill, cut into equal lengths, and an operator at control panel No. 1 presses a button. The chain-type steel rope conveyor starts, dragging the heavy steel billet sideways onto a roller table, which sends it directly to the heating furnace.

The heating section has two heating furnaces side by side. When the steel billet reaches the furnace door, it is stopped by a baffle. A pusher machine comes from the side, pushing the steel billet horizontally into the furnace. Our heating furnace is called a "two-stage heating furnace," also known as a "continuous heating furnace." The furnace is divided into two sections, each with a different function. The first section is only for heating, raising the steel billet's temperature to 1200 degrees Celsius. The second section is for equalizing the temperature, ensuring that the steel billet is heated uniformly throughout, with no unevenness. If the temperature of a steel billet is uneven, it will result in defective products during rolling.

After heating, the steel billet is pulled out of the furnace by a furnace-front pulling machine and placed on a roller table, which sends it to the rolling mill.

Three giant rolling mills stand shoulder to shoulder, each with three rolls: top, middle, and bottom. These are the newest "three-high rolling mills" from the Soviet Union. Each roll has a row of rolling grooves. The rolling grooves of the top and middle rolls, and the middle and bottom rolls, form a groove opening. Control panels No. 4 and 5 control the rolling mill's front and rear lifting platforms, clamping machine, flipping machine, and the rotation of the rolls. The steel billet comes and is tightly gripped by a transfer machine, sent towards the rolls, and as the rolls turn, it passes through the groove opening, becoming thinner and longer. Whatever the shape of the groove opening (called the pass design), the steel billet is rolled into that shape. A rectangular steel billet must be rolled back and forth more than ten times to be rolled into a steel rail, gradually deforming the angular rectangle until it is completely rolled into the shape of a steel rail during the final rolling. This is the semi-finished product of the steel rail.

The most difficult task on the rolling mill is adjusting the pass design. What product is rolled from the same steel billet depends on the pass design on the rolling mill. Those responsible for this work must not only have scientific knowledge and skilled techniques but also rich experience. To help us master this crucial technical aspect, the Soviet Union sent pass design experts, Stakhanov workers who have won Stalin Prizes, and experts with 28 years of rolling experience.

Operating a rolling mill in factories with old equipment requires workers to endure high temperatures of over 1000 degrees Celsius, manipulating and flipping steel billets weighing thousands of pounds. Now, in the large steel rolling mill, once the pass design is adjusted, no more physical labor is required. The roller table sends the steel billet back and forth; the lifting platform raises and lowers it, sending it from one pass to another; the flipping machine flips the steel billet that has been rolled in the first pair of passes to the second pair of passes; and the chain conveyor drags the steel billet that has been rolled in the first rolling mill to the second rolling mill for rolling. All these machines have interlocked safety devices; if the lifting platform malfunctions, pressing the button will not start the roller table; if one machine malfunctions, the other two will automatically stop. The workers operating these complex machines sit high in control rooms No. 4 and 5, with thick insulation under their feet and special glass in front and behind them. Through the glass, they can clearly see the red-hot steel billet flipping up and down, back and forth in the rolling mill. When it's cold, there's heating; when it's hot, cool air is supplied. The control room maintains a constant temperature, regardless of the scorching summer or freezing winter. The workers are not required to do heavy physical labor, nor is it as easy as turning on and off a light, as outsiders might think. Instead, they are required to be proficient in technology, calm and quick-witted, and to focus all their energy on the operation.

After the steel billet is rolled into a steel rail, it becomes long and slender. It is then sent by a roller table to a hot saw, three of which can be moved back and forth, cutting it into sections of a certain specification in one or two passes. As they pass through the printing machine, a series of numbers are stamped on each one. These numbers record the history of the steel rail, the year of production, the furnace number, the shift, and so on. No matter how much time passes, the origin of each steel rail can be traced according to the number, and someone will always be responsible for it.

If seamless steel pipe blanks are being rolled, the journey ends at the printing machine. After cooling, inspection, and surface treatment, they are sent to the warehouse to await transfer to the seamless steel pipe factory.

If semi-finished products of steel rails and various shaped steel are being rolled, they will go through the steel rail processing and shaped steel processing departments for processing and finishing, so that they become a perfect, solid, and usable finished product.

Thermal expansion and contraction is a scientific principle, and steel rails cannot escape the control of this law. If this principle is ignored, then the steel rail will be straight when hot-rolled, but after cooling, it will become a unusable bent rail. The designers understood this law, so they installed a rail bending machine here. Having calculated the possible downward bending of the hot steel rail after cooling, the rail bending machine first bends it in the opposite direction by a certain amount, so that it will be straight when the steel rail cools.

After the rail bending machine, the steel rail arrives at the central cooling platform. At this time, the temperature of the steel rail is still around 600 degrees Celsius. Once on the cooling platform, the steel rails are neatly laid down, divided into groups, and gently sent into slow cooling pits by magnetic cranes. They stay in that pit for twelve hours, allowing their temperature to gradually decrease to 120 degrees Celsius. The purpose of slow cooling is to ensure quality, to allow the hydrogen gas contained in the hot steel rail to slowly and naturally dissipate, preventing cracks from forming.

(Seamless steel pipe blanks and high-carbon high-quality steel billets are sent to the slow cooling pit first when they are sent from the rough rolling mill. After cooling, they are inspected and surface treated with wind shovels and flames. Those that pass the inspection are then sent to the heating furnace.)

The steel rails, cooled to 120 degrees Celsius, are still grouped by magnetic cranes and transported to a rack for straightening. The steel rails must pass through two straightening machines, one to straighten the steel rail and the other, a "vertical straightening machine," to straighten its left and right sides. After straightening, the steel rails arrive at a fully automated processing line.

The steel rail processing line has three steps: turning the ends, drilling holes, and quenching, which are completed in six steps for both ends of a steel rail. A pair of turning machines first turn the two ends of the steel rail to a smooth finish; a pair of drilling machines drills three holes on the side of the steel rail for the fishplate bolts when laying the railway; a pair of high-frequency quenching machines heats the two ends of the steel rail to 900 degrees Celsius with high-frequency current for quenching, making the ends particularly hard, resistant to the impact of trains, and resistant to wear.

After straightening, the steel rails enter the processing line and first arrive at a centering machine. When a worker presses a button, the centering machine starts moving on its own, clamping the two ends of the steel rail and measuring its length. The amazing thing is that without manual intervention, steel rails of the correct length are automatically released by the centering machine, allowing them to continue moving forward; those that do not meet the length requirements are retained for further testing by the next steel rail. Steel rails that continue to move forward encounter a series of turning machines, drilling machines, and quenching machines, which automatically process the steel rail one end at a time, one process after another. For example, when the steel rail arrives at the turning machine, the lathe starts to work automatically. First, it clamps the steel rail tightly; once it is clamped, the sharp turning tool automatically moves over and cuts, until one end is turned to a smooth finish, then it automatically retracts the tool and automatically releases the steel rail, allowing it to move forward to the second turning lathe to turn the other end. This pair after pair of machines, this complex production process, proceeds automatically in a rhythmic and orderly manner. By the time the steel rail leaves the processing line, its ends have been shaved, drilled, and quenched, and it is already a finished product. The finished product must undergo a very strict and meticulous inspection before being sent to the central warehouse, ready to be shipped out of the factory, distributed throughout the country, laid as railways, and gloriously take on the task of being the pioneers in connecting urban and rural areas, exchanging materials, developing resources, and developing industry.

The large steel rolling mill also has many complex automatic devices. Through the lubricating oil system, it automatically oils thousands of places in the factory that need oil, automatically collects waste oil, filters it, and sends it out again. There are various automatic meters and instruments. When steel billets and steel rails are placed on the scales, the weight is automatically recorded on the meter; the temperature in the heating furnace, the amount of gas, the amount of air, and the voltage and current on each machine are automatically displayed and recorded on the instruments. There are also various automatic safety devices; if a motor gets too hot, a red light will light up, and if the worker does not adjust it, the motor will automatically stop; if there is a problem in the heating furnace, an alarm bell will ring; if there is a fault in the electrical equipment anywhere in the factory, various signal lights will light up and indicate the location of the fault.

After seeing the large steel rolling mill, one cannot help but be moved. Only the great internationalist socialist country, the Soviet Union, could provide us with such selfless, systematic, and comprehensive assistance, helping us to surpass our existing technical level and build such an excellent factory, producing large quantities of useful steel for China's industrial construction.

    高度机械化自动化的大型轧钢厂
    孙英
    我国第一个五年计划里的一个重点工厂，大型轧钢厂建成了。这是我国第一座规模宏大、具有最先进技术设备的大型轧钢厂。有了这个工厂，我国就能自制重型钢轨，各种大型钢材，包括工字钢、槽钢、角钢、方钢、圆钢和其他型钢，吊车上的大梁，无缝钢管的管胚，轮船和兵舰上的龙骨。
    提起轧钢厂，我们就会想到在设备陈旧的轧钢厂中，工人冒着高温，进行繁重劳动的情景。在加热炉边，在轧钢机旁，火红的钢胚，巨蟒似的钢材，翻来覆去，穿上穿下，都要靠人力去翻去拨，稍不小心，眼睛手脚慢了一点，就会烫伤人。火烤烟熏，折磨着工人的健康。这种情景，在新建的大型轧钢厂里，是再也看不到了。苏联把最先进的设备供给了我国，按照最新的技术标准，替我们设计了一座高度机械化、自动化的工厂。大型轧钢厂，从接收钢胚到成品出库，很少再要用什么手工劳动，都是用机械化的工具，这些机械，又都是用电力操纵的。有的工段，并且已经完全自动化了；整个工段的复杂生产过程，从开始到结束，一道工序接着一道工序，自动进行。
    大型轧钢厂的产品，从原料到成品，要经过四个工段：钢胚工段、加热工段、轧钢工段和精整工段。下面用一个钢胚轧成钢轨的经过来加以介绍。
    火红的钢胚，从初轧厂送来，经过剪断，截成一样的长度，一号操纵台上的工人，按动电钮，链式的钢绳拖运机就转动起来，把笨重的钢胚横着拖运到辊道上，由辊道直送加热炉。
    加热工段，有并排的两座加热炉。钢胚到了炉门口，就有挡板拦住去路，推钢机从侧面上来，把钢胚横着推进炉膛。我们的加热炉，叫做“二段式加热炉”，也叫“连续式加热炉”。炉膛分成两段，起着两种不同的作用。前一段，只管加热，要把钢胚烧到一千二百度；后一段的作用是均热，钢胚通过这一段，浑身上下就能烧得一样热，没有一处的温度高低不匀。如果一根钢胚上，有一处温度不匀，到了压轧的时候，就会出废品。
    加热后的钢胚从炉里出来，由炉前扒钢机把它扒到辊道上，送往轧钢机。
    三台巨大的轧钢机，并肩站着，每台有上、中、下三个轧辊。这是苏联出的最新式的“三重式轧钢机”。每个轧辊上有一排轧钢槽。上、中两个和中、下两个轧辊的轧钢槽，对成一个槽孔。由四、五号操作台操纵着轧钢机前后升降台，夹料机、翻钢机和轧辊的转动。钢胚过来，就被移钢机紧紧咬住，送向轧辊，跟着轧辊的转动，通过槽孔，由粗变细，由短压长，槽孔（叫做孔型）是什么形状的，钢胚就被轧成什么形状的。一根长方形钢胚轧成钢轨，要经过十多次来回压轧，使有棱有角的长方形，逐渐变形，直到经过最后一次压轧，才能完全轧成钢轨的形状。这就是钢轨的半制品。
    轧钢机上，最困难的工作，就是调整孔型。同样的钢胚，轧出什么产品，就决定在轧钢机上的孔型。担负这个工作，不但要有科学的知识，要有熟练的技术，并且要有丰富的经验。苏联为了帮助我们掌握这一个重要环节上的技术，派来了孔型专家，派来了得过斯大林奖金的斯大哈诺夫工作者，也派来了有二十八年轧钢经验的专家。
    操纵轧钢机，在旧设备的工厂里，工人要冒着一千多度的高热，摆弄和翻腾上千斤重的钢胚。现在，在大型轧钢厂，只要调整好了孔型，就不再需要体力劳动。辊道来回送钢胚；升降台一起一落把钢胚从下面一个孔型出来，送进上面一个孔型；翻钢机把第一对孔轧完的钢胚，翻到第二对孔的线路上去；链式拖运机又把第一台轧钢机轧完了的钢胚拖运到第二台轧钢机去轧。所有这些机械，又都有连锁的保安装置；升降台出了毛病，再按电钮，辊道也不会转动了；一台机器上出了毛病，另外两台也都会自动停止下来。操纵这些复杂机械的工人，高高地坐在架在半空里的四、五号操纵室里，脚底下是厚厚的隔热层，前后都是特种玻璃，透过玻璃，可以清晰地看见火红钢胚，在轧钢机的上上下下，前前后后翻腾。冷了，有暖气，热了，送凉风，操纵室里，不管是炎热的暑天，还是酷冷的冬季，保持着一定的温度。要求工人的，不是繁重的体力劳动，当然，也不像外行人所想的，就像开闭电灯那样轻松，而是要求工人熟谙技术，沉着机敏，倾注全副精神在操纵上。
      钢胚压成了钢轨，拉得细长细长。出了轧钢机，就被辊道送到热锯跟前，三台热锯可以前后挪动，按照一定的规格，一次、两次，把它切成一段一段。当它们通过打印机的时候，就在它们每一根的身上，打上了一连串的号码。这些号码，记载着这根钢轨的身世，那年出品，第几炉钢，那一班制的，等等。不论过了多长时间，都可以按照号码，查明每一根钢轨的来历，永远有人对它负责。
      如果轧制的是无缝钢管的管胚，旅行到打印机，就结束了，经过冷却、检查和表面处理，就送入仓库，等候调往无缝钢管厂了。
    如果是钢轨和各种型钢的半制品，就要经过钢轨加工和型钢加工两个部门，给它加工修整，要使它成为一根完美、坚实、合用的成品。
    热胀冷缩，是科学的道理，钢轨也不能逃出这一规律的控制，谁不理睬这个法则，那么，热轧出来时，钢轨是笔直的，等到冷却以后，就成为不能用的弯轨了。设计家掌握了这个规律，所以在这里，安上了一台弯轨机。算出了热钢轨冷却后可能向下发生的弯度，弯轨机就把它先朝相反的方向弯多少，等到钢轨冷却了，恰好成为直的。
    经过弯轨机，钢轨到了中央冷却台。这时候，钢轨的温度还在六百度上下。钢轨上了冷却台，一根根整整齐齐地都躺下了，分成组由磁力吊车把它们平稳地送进缓冷坑去。在那个坑里，要呆十二小时，使它的温度逐渐降低到一百二十度。缓冷的作用在于保证质量，就是要使热钢轨身体里含着的氢气，能够慢慢自然地散发出来，防止钢轨发生裂纹。
  （无缝钢管管胚和高碳优质钢胚，是在初轧厂送来时，先送到缓冷坑，冷却后，进行检查，用风铲和火焰进行表面处理，合格的再送到加热炉去。）
    冷却到一百二十度的钢轨，仍由磁力吊车把它们分组运到台架上，送去矫正。钢轨要通过两台矫正机，有一台是把钢轨压直的，另一台“立式矫正机”是把它左右两侧压挺。经过矫正后的钢轨，就到了完全自动化的加工线上。
    钢轨加工线上，有镟头、钻眼和淬火三个步骤，分六次完成对一根钢轨两头的加工。一对镟头机，先后把钢轨两头镟光；一对钻眼机，把钢轨的侧面钻出敷铁路时上夹板螺丝的三个眼；一对高周波淬火机，用高周波电流把钢轨两端加热到九百度，进行淬火，使两头特别坚硬，经得住火车来回的冲击，不会被磨损。
    矫正以后的钢轨，进了加工线，先来到定心机。工人一按电钮，定心机就会自己行动起来，把钢轨两头卡住，量一量身材长短。奇妙的是不用人动手，长度合格的，定心机就会自动松开，让钢轨继续前进；不合格的，就会被扣留下来，让后边的钢轨再来试验身材。继续前进的钢轨，碰到一连串镟头机、钻眼机、淬火机，它们就会依次一头一头、一道工序一道工序，自动给钢轨加工。比如钢轨到了镟头机跟前，镟床就开始自动工作了。先把钢轨紧紧卡住；卡住了活，锐利的镟刀自动走过来，进行切削，直到把这一头镟光，就又自动退刀，自动松活，让钢轨前进到第二台镟头床，镟光另一头。这一对一对的机器，一道一道复杂的生产过程，完全是有节奏的、井井有序的自动进行。等到钢轨出了加工线的时候，头剃光了，钻了眼，淬过火，已经是成品了。成品还要经过十分严格和细密的检查，才送入中央仓库，准备出厂，分发全国，敷成铁路，光荣地担负起沟通城乡，交流物资，开发富源，发展工业的开路先锋的任务。
    大型轧钢厂还有复杂的许多自动化装置。通过润滑油系统，给全厂机器的成千上万需要油的地方，自动加油，自动收回废油，过滤了，又送出去。有各种自动计器和仪表。钢胚钢轨上了磅秤，计器上就自动记录下来了重量；加热炉里，温度高低，煤气量多少，风量大小，各台机器上的电压、电流，都可以从仪表上自动显示出来，按时记录下来。还有各种自动的保安装置，马达热了，红灯就亮了，工人再不去调整，马达就自动停了；加热炉里出了毛病，警铃就响起来；全厂那里的电气设备有了故障，各种信号灯都会亮起来；并且指示出毛病的所在。
    看了大型轧钢厂，不由得你不感动，只有伟大国际主义的社会主义国家苏联，才可能这样给我们以无私的、系统的、全面的援助，帮助我们超越我国现有的技术水平，建设起这样优秀的工厂来，为我国的工业建设，生产大量的有用钢材。
