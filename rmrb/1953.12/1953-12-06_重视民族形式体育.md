    Emphasizing National Forms of Sports
    Yuan Yi

    Some outstanding athletes who participated in the "National Ethnic Forms Sports Performance and Competition Conference," upon invitation by the All-China Sports Federation, came to Beijing to give observation performances and achieved great success. The observation performances not only revealed the richness and variety of our country's ethnic forms of sports projects and their vigorous development in recent years; more importantly, they pointed out a clear direction for sorting out this part of our cultural heritage. The observation performances included seventy programs such as martial arts (fist techniques, weaponry), folk sports, wrestling, weightlifting (stone locks, barbells), etc. All the programs had both the practical value of exercising the body and the characteristic of beautiful imagery, leaving a deep impression on the capital's audience. In particular, certain improvements in martial arts, such as the "Mian Quan" and "Natural Sword" of the Southwest region athlete Lan Suzhen, were more welcomed by the audience because they absorbed some of the advantages of dance and gymnastics, preserving and promoting the advantages of ethnic forms of sports.

    The vast majority of ethnic forms of sports were created by the working people, and they have close ties with the people. In this observation performance, some programs demonstrated the hardworking, brave, and tenacious qualities of the Chinese people, while others simply reflected the fighting forms passed down from ancient people in their struggle against aggression and oppression. For example, the "Spear and Shield Combat" of East China athletes Cai Yun and Cai Xinhe, and the "Pellet Shooting" of railway athlete Gao Jinrong and others, are beautified ancient combat movements. Some have further absorbed more dance art and become people's entertainment programs. For example, the "Seesaw" of Northeast Korean athletes Li Yishun and others, the "Elephant Foot Drum Dance" of Southwest Dai athletes Diao Zhengzhong and Diao Liangyou, the "Hulu Sheng Dance" of Miao athlete Gu Xiaozong, and the "Swordsmanship" popular throughout the country, all have fairly advanced dance art imagery.

    These are the essence of ethnic forms of sports, and they are deeply loved by people of all ethnic groups. Therefore, it will inevitably continue to develop, and like other sports projects, play a huge role in improving people's health and serving production and national defense construction.

    In the four years since the founding of New China, ethnic forms of sports have made significant progress. Among the broad masses of working people, there are a very large number of people who exercise in an organized or voluntary manner. The state-owned Tianjin No. 1, 4, 5, and 6 cotton textile mills, every mine in the Kailuan Coal Mine in Tangshan City, and the suburbs of Taiyuan City, Wenshui, Changzhi, and other counties in Shanxi Province, and the fishing villages of Baiyangdian in Hebei Province, all have their own favorite ethnic forms of sports projects. In minority areas, due to the general improvement of political, economic, and cultural life, sports activities with strong ethnic characteristics have also been greatly developed. For example, Mongolian people's wrestling and horse racing, Tibetan people's riding and archery, and Miao and Dai people's singing and dancing sports dances have all become greatly active. Due to the widespread development of sports, outstanding sports achievements have also continued to emerge. Therefore, at this "National Ethnic Forms Sports Performance and Competition Conference," Sengge, a heavyweight wrestler from Inner Mongolia, defeated Zhang Kuiyuan, a highly acclaimed wrestling master of the same level from North China, and gloriously won first place.

    The practical value of ethnic forms of sports is very obvious. Miao Yulong, an athlete from the Northwest region, is already a 75-year-old man, but when he wields a staff and skillfully performs "Drunken Stick," he is no less capable than a strong young man. Nie Zengyong, a model worker from a brick and tile factory of a state-owned construction company and a Central South athlete, performed "Double Swords Against Spear" and "Broadsword Against Spear" at the observation performance. In the past, he often suffered from stomach problems and was physically weak, making his work very strenuous; since participating in martial arts training, his health has undergone a significant change. Now, he can not only accurately complete his production tasks on time, but also regularly over-fulfill his production tasks by 50%. There are many similar examples. For example, Liu Zhenjia, a railway athlete and first-class meritorious worker of the Jinan Railway Administration who performed "Sun and Moon Convenient Shovel," was able to obtain this glorious title not only because he has a high degree of political awareness and work enthusiasm, but also because he regularly engages in sports training, forging a strong body and superhuman arm strength, helping him to create superior achievements in his daily work.

    According to sports experts familiar with martial arts and other ethnic forms of sports: the various sports projects retained by the people of all ethnic groups in our country, whether martial arts, wrestling, riding and archery, shooting, stone locks, or other folk sports activities, have great value for exercising the human body's limbs, joints, blood circulation, internal organs, and nervous system. It can improve people's agility, endurance, jumping, and other physical abilities, so it is well worth promoting. Especially martial arts, which are not restricted by venue, equipment, age, or gender, and the movements are simple and the imagery is relatively beautiful, making it very suitable for promotion among the broad masses of people.

    However, ethnic forms of sports, like other ethnic cultural heritages, have been passed down from a long feudal society, and some parts of it are also tainted with feudal characteristics, such as crude and terrifying practices, such as breaking stones, splitting ribs, and oil hammers penetrating the crown, which must be reformed. The sectarianism and mysterious and illusory colors that exist in the martial arts world, these toxins and dirt imposed on the simple ethnic forms of sports by the feudal ruling class, also need to be carefully cleaned.

    Chairman Mao pointed out in his book "On New Democracy": "China's long feudal society created a splendid ancient culture. Clearing the development process of ancient culture, removing its feudal dross, and absorbing its democratic essence are necessary conditions for developing a new national culture and enhancing national self-confidence; but it must not be uncritically absorbed in its entirety. It is necessary to distinguish between all the decadent things of the ancient feudal ruling class and the excellent people's culture of ancient times, that is, things that have a certain degree of democracy and revolution." This is also our fundamental principle in dealing with ethnic forms of sports. However, at present, there are still a few people in the martial arts world who cannot treat ethnic forms of sports activities in the spirit of Chairman Mao's instruction. They mistakenly believe that "once it is sorted out, it will lose its national style," or that "the inherent form is already perfect and cannot be reformed." This conservative idea of sticking to the old ways will cause ethnic forms of sports activities, especially martial arts, to become detached from the people. The facts are very obvious, and it has been clearly shown in the "National Ethnic Forms Sports Performance and Competition Conference" and the observation performances in Beijing that only projects that can improve physical health, have practical value, and are beautiful in imagery are welcomed and loved by the masses of the people. The success of Lan Suzhen's performance of "Mian Quan" and "Natural Sword" lies in the fact that she absorbed the essence of ancient boxing techniques and the advantages of modern gymnastics and dance, creating boxing techniques that have practical value and beautiful imagery. Therefore, we should reform and sort out ethnic forms of sports, and study and create more beautiful, more scientific, and more useful forms, so that its original beautiful national style can be further promoted and carried forward.

    Our country has many ethnic groups and a vast territory, and the work of sorting out ethnic forms of sports must be carried out with leadership, planning, focus, and steps in order to achieve practical results. This is a major task of transforming old culture, and the party organizations and people's governments in various places should attach importance to this work; help sports organizations educate the vast number of martial arts practitioners and ethnic forms of sports athletes, so that they and other sports workers in the area can unite and discover some folk sports forms that have not yet been discovered. According to the two major principles of "practicality" and "beautiful imagery," we should study the sports projects that are most popular and have the greatest impact among the people, avoid "uncritically absorbing in their entirety," and prevent impatience and the resulting rude attitude.

    According to the experience of cities such as Tianjin and Harbin, organizing ethnic forms of sports athletes, especially martial arts practitioners, to study political current events and improve their level of awareness in accordance with the principle of voluntarism, and relying on them to conduct research and sorting out of ethnic forms of sports on this basis, is more likely to achieve practical results. In addition, organizing them to hold different types of performance competitions based on the actual situation is also an important method. This can absorb the opinions of the masses and better carry out the research and sorting out of ethnic forms of sports.

    Our country's ethnic forms of sports have already shown their brilliance in this performance and competition conference and in the observation performances in Beijing. As long as ethnic forms of sports athletes can break with conservative ideas, unite around the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, improve their political and ideological level, and learn from each other with humility, we believe that new, more scientific, and more beautiful ethnic forms of sports activities will develop more rapidly among the broad masses of people in our country.

    重视民族形式体育
    袁毅
    参加“全国民族形式体育表演及竞赛大会”的部分优秀运动员，在大会闭幕后，应中华全国体育运动委员会的邀请，来北京作观摩演出，获得很大的成功。观摩演出不仅显露了我国民族形式体育项目的丰富多采，和它在近年来的蓬勃发展；更主要的，是它提示了整理这部分文化遗产的明确方向。观摩演出的项目，有武术（拳术、器械）、民间体育、摔跤、举重（石锁、杠铃）等七十个节目。全部节目都具有锻炼身体的实用价值和形象优美两大特色，给首都观众留下了深刻印象。特别是武术的某些改进，如西南区运动员蓝素贞的“绵拳”和“自然剑”，因为吸收了舞蹈和体操的一些优点，保存并发扬了民族形式体育的优点，更为观众所欢迎。
    民族形式体育的绝大部分，是由劳动人民所创造的，它和人民有着密切的联系。在此次观摩演出中，有些节目表现了我国人民勤劳、勇敢、顽强的品质，有的则质朴地反映了古代人民在反抗侵略和压迫的斗争中，流传下来的斗争形态。如华东区运动员蔡云、蔡信和的“矛盾对打”、铁路运动员高金荣等的“弹丸”，就是美化了的古代战斗动作。有的进而吸取了更多的舞蹈艺术，变成了人民的文娱节目。如东北区朝鲜族运动员李乙顺等的“跳板”、西南区傣族运动员刁正中和刁良友的“象脚鼓舞”、苗族运动员古小宗的“葫芦笙舞”和流行全国各地的“剑术”等，都有着相当高级的舞蹈艺术形象。
    这些，就是民族形式体育的精华，它深为各族人民所喜爱。因此，它也必然会继续发展，和其它体育运动项目一样，在为增进人民健康、在为生产和国防建设服务等方面，发挥巨大的作用。
    新中国成立四年来，民族形式体育已有了显著的发展。在广大劳动人民群众中，有组织或自动进行锻炼的人是非常多的。国营天津第一、第四、第五、第六等棉纺织厂，唐山市开滦煤矿的每一矿井，和山西省太原市及文水、长治等县的郊区，河北省白洋淀的渔村，都各自有他们喜好的民族形式体育项目。少数民族地区，由于政治、经济、文化生活的普遍提高，具有浓厚的本民族色彩的体育活动，也随即得到相当的发展。如蒙古人民的摔跤、赛马，藏族人民的骑射，苗族、傣族人民的载歌载舞的体育舞蹈，都大大地活跃起来。由于体育运动的普遍开展，优异的体育运动成绩也不断地涌现。所以在这次“全国民族形式体育表演及竞赛大会”上，内蒙古重量级摔跤运动员僧格，就战胜了享有盛誉的同级摔跤能手华北区运动员张魁元，光荣地获得第一名。
    民族形式体育的实用价值，是十分明显的。西北区运动员苗玉龙，已经是七十五高龄的老人了，但当他舞动一条杆棒，矫健地表演着“醉棍”时，并不下于一个年富力强的壮汉。在观摩演出会上表演“双刀进枪”和“大刀枪”的中南区运动员聂增永，他是国营建筑公司某砖瓦厂的劳动模范。过去，他经常闹胃病，身体虚弱，工作很吃力；自从参加了武术锻炼，他的健康状况有了显著的改变。现在，他不仅能准确地按期完成生产任务，而且经常地超额百分之五十完成生产任务。类似这样的实例还很多。如表演“日月方便铲”的铁路运动员、济南铁路管理局一等功臣刘振家，他之所以能够获得这一光荣称号，不仅因为他具有高度的政治觉悟和工作的积极性，而且因为他经常地进行体育锻炼，炼就了一副强健的身体和超人的臂力，帮助他在日常劳动中创造了优越的成绩。
    据通晓武术和其它民族形式体育的体育界人士谈：我国各族人民所保有的各种体育项目，无论武术、摔跤、骑射、步射、石锁或其它民间体育活动，对人体四肢、关节、血液循环、内脏和神经系统的锻炼，都有很大的价值，它可以使人的敏捷、耐久、跳跃等体能得到提高，所以很值得推广。尤其是武术，不受场地、设备、年龄、性别的限制，而且动作简单，形象也比较优美，很适宜在广大人民群众中推广。
    但民族形式体育也和其它民族文化遗产一样，是从长期的封建社会中传流下来的，它的有些部分，也染有封建性的色彩，如粗野恐怖的、违反生理的开石、排肋、油锤贯顶等等，这都是必须加以改革的。而存在于武术界中的宗派思想和神秘、虚玄的色彩，这些为封建统治阶级强加于质朴的民族形式体育的毒素和污垢，也是需要认真进行清洗的。
    毛主席在“新民主主义论”一书中指出：“中国的长期封建社会中，创造了灿烂的古代文化。清理古代文化的发展过程，剔除其封建性的糟粕，吸收其民主性的精华，是发展民族新文化提高民族自信心的必要条件；但是决不能无批判地兼收并蓄。必须将古代封建统治阶级的一切腐朽的东西和古代优秀的人民文化即多少带有民主性和革命性的东西区别开来。”这也就是我们对待民族形式体育的根本方针。但目前武术界却还有少数人不能以毛主席的这一指示精神来对待民族形式体育活动，他们错误地认为“一经整理即会失却民族风格”，或者说
  “固有形式已尽善尽美，无可改革”了。这种故步自封的保守思想，将会使民族形式体育活动、特别是武术脱离人民。事实非常明显，在“全国民族形式体育表演及竞赛大会”和在北京观摩演出中，已经清楚地显示出：只有能够增进身体健康，具有实用价值和形象优美的项目，才受到人民群众的欢迎和喜爱。蓝素贞表演“绵拳”和“自然剑”之所以成功，就在于她吸收了古代拳术中的精华和现代体操、舞蹈的优点，创造了有实用价值和形象优美的拳术。因此，我们应该对民族形式体育加以改革和整理，研究创造更美好、更科学、更有用的形式，使它原有的优美的民族风格更加发扬光大。
    我国民族众多，国土辽阔，民族形式体育的整理工作必须有领导、有计划、有重点、有步骤地进行，才能获得实效。这是改造旧文化的一项重大任务，各地党的组织和人民政府，应当重视这一工作；帮助体育机构教育广大武术界人士和民族形式体育运动员，使他们和当地的其它体育工作者团结一致，发掘尚未被发现的一些流行在民间的体育形式。根据“实用”和“形象优美”两大原则，研究在民间流行最广、影响最大的体育运动项目，避免“无批判地兼收并蓄”，并防止急躁情绪以及由此而来的粗暴态度。
    根据天津、哈尔滨等城市的经验，按照自愿原则，组织民族形式体育运动员、尤其武术界人士进行政治时事学习，提高他们的觉悟程度，在这样的基础上，依靠他们进行民族形式体育的研究和整理，是比较更易收得实效的。另外，从实际情况出发，组织他们举行不同类型的表演比赛会，也是一个重要方法。这可以吸收群众的意见，更好地进行民族形式体育的研究和整理工作。
    我国的民族形式体育，在这次表演及竞赛大会和在北京的观摩演出中，已显露了它的奇光异彩，只要民族形式体育运动员能打破保守思想，团结在中国共产党和人民政府的周围，提高政治思想水平，相互虚心学习，我们相信：新型的、更科学、更优美的民族形式体育活动，就会更快地在我国广大人民群众中发展起来。
