State-owned Foreign Trade System Enterprises Completed 95% of the Annual Profit Delivery Task by the End of November

The state-owned foreign trade system enterprises have deepened the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and have achieved certain results. As of the end of November, they have completed 95% of the annual profit delivery task for the entire foreign trade system. Except for the China National Native Produce & Animal By-products Import & Export Corporation and the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation, which still need to make the greatest efforts to complete the profit delivery plan, other companies can generally guarantee the completion of the annual profit delivery task and are working together to strive for an additional profit delivery of 10,000 billion yuan.

The reason why state-owned foreign trade enterprises have achieved the above results is primarily due to the resolute implementation of the import and export plan. On the import side, they have kept abreast of the execution of foreign orders at all times, organized overseas transportation forces to promptly ship foreign deliveries back to China, and supplied them to production and construction and market needs. On the export side, since October, export corporations have successively organized many work groups to go deep into various production areas to inspect and urge purchases, organize timely transportation, and strengthen connections with relevant departments to solve a number of export source problems, thereby promoting the realization of the export plan.

Secondly, improving enterprise management and reducing various expenses in the process of commodity processing and circulation are also important keys. For example, China National Machinery Import & Export Corporation has learned from advanced Soviet experience and implemented a division of labor system centered on organizing commodity circulation, which has improved the company's management methods. The Tianjin Native Produce Export Corporation improved the starch production process and processing machinery and equipment, which improved the quality and flour yield, and reduced processing costs by 40%. Local food export corporations used double-layer wooden frames to transport live pigs, which increased the load capacity by 75% to 80% compared to the previous single-layer wooden frames, reducing costs by approximately 40%.

Various units have actively mobilized the masses, deeply explored the potential of enterprises, and launched a mass rationalization proposal movement. The Northeast Import Joint Office, through criticizing "agency thinking," clarified the ideas of "serving industry" and "serving cargo owners" for general cadres, laying a correct ideological foundation for increasing production and practicing economy. The China National Chemicals Import & Export Corporation, through party branches, trade unions, and other organizations, arranged the work plan for the fourth quarter, and in response to the problems exposed by the inspection work of each section, put forward specific action slogans, such as the financial accounting section proposing "Four Conformities"—accounts matching accounts, accounts matching goods, accounts matching documents, and accounts matching tables; the planning section proposed "Three Diligences"—diligence in asking, diligence in contacting, and diligence in urging, in response to the leadership's call.

The Ministry of Foreign Trade recently convened a meeting of managers of various specialized head offices and conducted a preliminary inspection. The leaders of the ministry gave specific instructions, emphasizing that all units must continue to work hard, strengthen ties with all parties, and resolutely complete all plans for this year. At the same time, they should earnestly do a good job in the year-end final accounts, laying a solid foundation for further implementing increased production and economy and improving business management in the coming year. The various tasks for the first quarter of next year should be arranged in December, and the goals for 1954 should be clearly proposed.

At present, in the campaign to increase production and practice economy in various foreign trade enterprises, political and ideological leadership is not deep enough, and regular inspections and promotion of advanced experiences are not done enough, and further strengthening is still needed. The Ministry of Foreign Trade is preparing to combine the study of the general line and general task of the country's transition period to generally improve the ideological understanding of cadres, further improve foreign trade work, and implement increased production and economy into the regular work of every cadre.

### 国营对外贸易系统各企业单位到十一月底止  完成全年上缴利润任务百分之九十五

    国营对外贸易系统各企业单位到十一月底止
    完成全年上缴利润任务百分之九十五
    国营对外贸易系统各企业单位增产节约运动深入开展，已取得一定成果，截至十一月底为止，已完成本年度整个对外贸易系统上缴利润任务百分之九十五。除中国畜产公司及中国食品出口公司尚须作最大努力，争取完成上缴利润计划外，其他各公司一般均可保证完成全年上缴利润任务，并一致为争取再超额上缴一万亿元的利润而努力。
    国营对外贸易企业各单位所以取得以上的成绩，首先在于坚决执行了进出口计划。在进口方面，随时掌握国外订货合同执行情况，组织海外运输力量，将国外交货及时运回国内，供应生产建设与市场需要；在出口方面，各出口公司从十月份开始，先后组织了不少工作小组，深入各地产区，检查督促收购，及时组织调运，同时并加强与有关部门联系，解决了若干出口货源上的问题，促进了出口计划的实现。
    其次，改善企业经营管理，降低商品加工、流转过程中各种费用，也是重要关键之一。如中国机械进口公司，学习苏联先进经验，实行以组织商品流转为中心的分工制度，使该公司的经营管理方法提高一步。天津土产出口公司改进淀粉生产过程与加工机器设备，提高了质量与出粉率，降低加工费百分之四十；各地食品出口公司采用双层木架运输活猪，较过去单层木架提高装载量百分之七十五至八十，降低费用约百分之四十。
    各单位通过积极发动群众，深入发掘企业潜在力量，展开了群众性合理化建议运动。东北进口联合办事处通过批判“代理思想”，使一般干部明确了“为工业服务”“为货主服务”的思想，为增产节约打下了正确的思想基础。中国化工杂品进口公司通过党支部、工会等组织，将第四季度工作计划作了布置，并针对各科检查工作所暴露的问题，提出具体行动口号，如财会科提出“四符”——账账相符、账货相符、账单相符、账表相符；计划科提出“三勤”——勤问、勤联系、勤督促等口号来，响应领导上的号召。
    中央对外贸易部最近召集了各专业总公司经理会议，进行了初步检查，部的领导方面作了具体指示，强调指出：各单位必须继续努力，加强与各方面联系，坚决完成本年度各项计划；同时应认真做好年终决算工作，为明年度进一步贯彻增产节约，改善经营管理打下巩固基础。对于明年第一季度各项工作，在十二月份内应作好布置，明确提出一九五四年度奋斗目标。
    目前各对外贸易企业单位在增产节约运动中，政治思想领导尚不够深入，定期检查与推广先进经验做的还不够，尚须进一步加强。中央对外贸易部准备结合国家过渡时期总路线和总任务的学习，普遍提高干部思想认识，进一步搞好对外贸易工作，将增产节约贯彻到每一个干部经常的工作中去。
