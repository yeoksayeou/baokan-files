    Thoroughly Understanding the General Line by Cadres in Education Districts and Townships
    Currently, various regions are holding district and township cadre meetings and Party member meetings to organize grassroots cadres and Party members to study the general line for the transition period and to arrange grain purchase work, cooperative mutual aid work, and other winter production work, which has achieved significant results. Many grassroots cadres and Communist Party members in various regions, after participating in discussions and studies at the meetings, now understand the Party's general line, which they did not understand before. Those who were not actively participating in and leading the mutual aid and cooperation movement have now become active, and those who did not plan to sell grain to the state are now selling it to the state.
    Stalin said: "In order to realize a correct political line, it is necessary to have cadres, it is necessary to have people who understand the Party's political line, accept it as their own line, are determined to realize it, are good at practically realizing it, can be responsible for it, can protect it, and can fight for it. Without this condition, the correct political line is bound to become empty words on paper." ("Report on the Work of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) at the Eighteenth Party Congress") District and township cadre meetings are one of the methods to cultivate cadres who understand the Party's line. Whether they can be held well is the key to the smooth development of current rural work.
    Experience has shown that to hold these meetings well, to enable the vast number of grassroots cadres and Communist Party members to thoroughly understand the general line, to consciously support the general line, to gradually raise their political and ideological level to the height of socialism, and to make them consciously support the state's mutual aid and cooperation policies and grain purchase policies, and to sell their surplus grain to the state as an example, it is necessary to persist in patient and repeated ideological education. This ideological education must proceed from principles to specifics, from near to far, and from shallow to deep; and adopt methods such as visiting exhibitions, visiting factories, calculating accounts, recalling experiences, making comparisons, and pouring out grievances to vividly combine the correct ideological content with the vital interests and personal experiences of the vast number of grassroots cadres and Communist Party members. Only in this way can everyone combine their immediate interests with long-term interests, and personal interests with national interests.
    Judging from the meeting situation in many regions, the development law of the thinking of the cadres and Party members who attended the meeting is generally like this: After the general line is conveyed, the general mood is high, and they warmly support the general line. They say, "The goal of struggle is clear," "The general line illuminates our path forward," "In the past, we talked about organizing every day, but we didn't know what the purpose was. Now we know it's for the socialist transformation of agriculture." But when they come into contact with specific work, such as mobilizing farmers to sell their surplus grain to the state, some people feel it is difficult. After careful accounting and comparison, the mood is high again, even higher, saying, "This time, not only the big principles are clear, but the small principles are also clear," "Thank you, Chairman Mao, for pulling us back from the crossroads," "We are determined to complete the tasks assigned by the Party." In this way, the guarantee for the victorious development of rural work in many regions has been obtained.
    To hold district, township cadre and Party member meetings well, it is first necessary to make a report on the Party's general line, so that cadres and Party members generally understand why to take the socialist road and how to take the socialist road. This report should not only explain the problem from the perspective of grand principles; but also from the perspective of the vital interests and personal experiences of the farmers. In order to make this report well, many regions have sent cadres to go deep into the countryside in advance to investigate the ideological situation of cadres, Party members, and the masses, the production and living conditions of farmers, and select typical examples to enrich their reports. Before the report, they also solicited opinions from key members and made corrections. The advantage of this report is that it closely links the Party's general line with the personal experiences of cadres and Party members, making it persuasive and easy for everyone to accept. It brings into play the positive factors in the work of the past four years, avoids creating the illusion among cadres that "we took the wrong path in the past," and further enhances everyone's courage to move forward. It connects the Party's general line with the current important tasks, guiding everyone to discuss issues related to their own production, life, and thinking, especially issues such as small-scale peasant economy.
    After the Party's general line is conveyed, the cadres and Party members attending the meeting should be organized for discussion. Various ideological problems will be exposed during the discussion. For example, when discussing the issue of national industrialization, some people proposed that agriculture should be the focus of national construction. The reason why there are such different opinions is that many cadres have been working in rural areas for a long time, and many grassroots cadres are themselves of peasant origin. It is not surprising that they unconsciously use the perspective of small-scale peasant economy to understand the Party's general line. In this case, the responsibility of the Party organization is not to adopt simple and rude methods, putting labels such as "small-scale peasant economy perspective," "capitalist ideology," "backward," and "conservative" on these comrades, but should patiently lead everyone in free and practical discussions, encouraging everyone to think freely and boldly raise questions. After a large number of ideas are exposed, discuss around several key issues. The more ideological problems are exposed, the more thoroughly the problems are solved.
    How to organize the discussion? The cadre expansion meeting in Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province, and the three-level cadre meetings in other regions have created very good experiences. These experiences are equally applicable to cadre or Party member meetings in a township or a village. Through recalling and comparing, they calculated several accounts of the great achievements of the country in the past four years and the benefits farmers have received. This made the cadres realize that the work of the past four years was carried out following the Party's general line. What everyone has most deeply realized in the discussion is that the output has increased year by year. For example, the average yield per mu in Songjiang County was less than 400 jin when it was first liberated. It increased to 450 jin in 1951, the yield in 1952 was close to 500 jin, and this year it has exceeded 500 jin; the number of cattle in the county has increased by more than 15,000, and the number of piglets has increased by more than 58,000. Due to the rapid recovery and development of production, farmers' lives have been improved. In Wujiaqiao Village, Changlou Township, out of 184 households, only 18 households ate "two dry meals and one thin meal" when it was first liberated, and the rest ate porridge, bran, and pumpkin. Now, 114 households eat "two dry meals and one thin meal." This improvement in farmers' lives is inseparable from the reduction in the prices of industrial products. Before liberation, two dan of rice were needed to make a set of single clothes, but now only one dan of rice is needed; before liberation, one dou of rice could be exchanged for one jin of kerosene, but now it can be exchanged for five jin of kerosene. Comparing this year's prices with last year's prices, the benefits farmers have received are also great. For example, calculated based on the eight items of iron pots, Longtou fine cloth, soap, raw oil, yarn, brown sugar, salt, and hemp skins sold by the county's cooperative this year, the prices are about 11.8 billion yuan cheaper than last year. With this money, you can buy more than 11,790 cattle, and you can buy 118 water pumps. This kind of comparison and accounting made the cadres who attended the meeting recognize that the reason why farmers have been able to obtain these benefits in the past four years is due to the victory of the Party's general line; due to the support of industry for agriculture; and due to the growth of the country's socialist elements. In this way, the various benefits that farmers have obtained are linked to the general line, inspiring their confidence in building socialism.
    After initially understanding the victory of the general line and the socialist road, further education on the two roads should be carried out. Exposing the shortcomings of the small-scale peasant economy and complaining about the suffering of the small-scale peasant economy have become the central link in raising the class consciousness of grassroots cadres. At the Songjiang County cadre expansion meeting, everyone was mobilized to discuss the question of "Why couldn't we get rich in the past when we wanted to get rich?" During the discussion, the cadres naturally recalled the suffering before liberation. Among the 1,100 households in Wangqian Township, Fengjing District, only five rich peasants and two landlords got rich. The vice chairman of the farmers' association in this township died at the age of eleven because he had no money to bury his father. His sister became a child bride, his younger sister was sent to others to raise, his younger brother died, he himself worked as a hired laborer for seven years, married a wife, bought cattle, and farmed the land himself, but before long, his wife died and he became poor again, until the land reform when he turned over. In this way, everyone naturally came to a conclusion: "We can't count on getting rich by taking the old road. Those who got rich in the past were either puppet military officers or big bullies, or puppet township chiefs, or speculative merchants. Diligent and thrifty farmers get up at five o'clock and sleep in the middle of the night, but they still can't make a living. Generations have wanted 'tens of thousands of taels of gold,' but they have never been able to get rich." This made everyone realize from their personal experience that the small-scale peasant economy cannot withstand wind and rain, and the small-scale peasant economy must be "thousands of families die in bitterness, and one family gets rich." Therefore, the only bright road in front of the peasants is to take the road of socialism.
    On this ideological basis, further discuss the issue of how to take the socialist road. First, start with comparing the happy life of the Soviet people today and comparing the lives of farmers before and after liberation, and further get through the idea of getting rich collectively, relying on industrialization, relying on agricultural cooperation, and relying on the worker-peasant alliance. For example, cadres in Songjiang County deeply realized in the discussion that this year's fight against drought was because the government supported water-lifting machines, so the harvest was not reduced. Cadres in Wulong Township, Chengdong District, also calculated such an account: if the township had water-lifting machines this year, each mu could definitely yield another 50 jin of grain, and the township could yield another 430,000 jin. After such comparison and accounting, realizing socialist industrialization has become the conscious requirement of the cadres who attended the meeting. In order to help the cadres who attended the meeting deepen their understanding of industrialization, the Songjiang County Party Committee also held an exhibition, using various charts, objects, and models, and using the method of comparison and accounting, to reflect the increase in the means of production after liberation, the improvement of farmers' lives, and the increase in the ratio of the price of agricultural products exchanged for industrial products, and organized cadres to visit factories. On the basis of the cadres having a deeper understanding of socialist industrialization, further clarify to the cadres that developing mutual aid and cooperation in rural areas and doing a good job in purchasing grain are the specific steps taken to take the socialist road.
    In order to make everyone draw a clear line between socialist and capitalist ideology, and in order to have a deeper understanding of the general line, leading cadres must take the lead in conducting an ideological review from top to bottom. Judging from the situation revealed in various places, the development of spontaneous capitalist forces in rural areas in recent years is very serious, and many cadres and Party members have been affected and eroded by it, and the Party's work has been destroyed and damaged by it. To examine ideology, it is necessary to combine it with examining various tasks. What past work has deviated from the Party's general line? What has developed capitalism? At the cadre meetings in many regions, after the responsible cadres examined their own thoughts and work, the cadres and Party members who attended the meeting consciously exposed their capitalist thoughts. But it should be noted that the influence of capitalist thoughts among cadres and Party members is blind and unconscious, and it is also related to the lack of frequent socialist education by the higher authorities in the past; once it is explained clearly, everyone will automatically abandon this ideological influence; even comrades who have serious mistakes, many belong to the blind. Therefore, we must adhere to the policy of education and improvement for these cadres and Party members, and we must not adopt the policy of attack, ridicule or other policies. This is to adhere to the policy instructed by Comrade Mao Zedong: "The first is 'learn from past mistakes to avoid future ones', and the second is 'cure the sickness to save the patient'. We must expose past mistakes, we must not be sentimental, we must analyze and criticize the bad things of the past with a scientific attitude, so that later work will be more cautious and better. This is the meaning of 'learn from past mistakes to avoid future ones'. But the purpose of our exposing mistakes and criticizing shortcomings is, just like a doctor treating a disease, entirely to save people, not to put people to death." "Any person who makes mistakes, as long as he does not conceal his illness and refuse treatment, does not stubbornly cling to his mistakes to the point of being incurable, but is honest and truly willing to be treated and willing to correct, we should welcome him, cure his illness, and turn him into a good comrade. This work will never be effective if it is happy for a while and beaten up in a mess. We must not adopt a reckless attitude towards ideological and political illnesses, we must adopt the attitude of 'curing the sickness to save the patient', which is the correct and effective method." ("Rectify the Party's Style of Work")
    In order to hold the district and township cadre meetings well and educate district and township cadres to thoroughly understand the country's general line for the transition period, leading cadres at all levels must personally organize and guide the conduct of these meetings. This is an arduous task. However, as long as leading cadres at all levels can proceed in accordance with the above principles and experience, the meetings will definitely be successful.

    教育区乡干部彻底懂得总路线
    目前各地正在召开区乡干部会议和党员会议，组织基层干部和党员学习过渡时期的总路线，并布置购粮工作、合作互助工作及其他冬季生产工作，收到很大的效果。许多地区的基层干部、共产党员，在参加会议的讨论和学习之后，原来不懂得党的总路线的现在懂得了，原来不积极参加和领导互助合作运动的现在变得积极了，原来不打算把粮食卖给国家的现在卖给国家了。
    斯大林说过：“为了实现正确的政治路线，就需要有干部，就需要有懂得党底政治路线，把它当作自己的路线来接受，决意把它实现起来，善于切实把它实现起来，能够对它负责，能够保护它，能够为它而奋斗的人材。没有这个条件，正确的政治路线就不免要化为纸上空文了。”（“在第十八次党代表大会上关于联共（布）中央工作的总结报告”）区乡干部会议就是培养懂得党的路线的干部的方法之一，它能不能开得好，是目前农村工作能否顺利发展的关键。
    经验证明，要开好这些会议，要使广大基层干部和共产党员彻底懂得总路线，自觉地拥护总路线，把他们的政治思想水平逐步提高到社会主义的高度，并使他们自觉地拥护国家的互助合作政策和粮食收购政策，以身作则地把自己的余粮卖给国家，就必须坚持耐心的反复的思想教育，而这种思想教育又必须由原则到具体，由近到远，由浅入深；并采用看展览会、参观工厂、算账、回忆、对比、诉苦等办法，生动地把正确的思想内容和广大基层干部、共产党员的切身利益，切身经验结合起来。这样才能使大家把眼前的利益与长远利益结合起来，个人利益和国家利益结合起来。
    从许多地区的会议情况来看，到会干部、党员的思想的发展规律一般地是这样的：在传达总路线之后，一般的情绪是高的，热烈拥护总路线，他们说：“奋斗目标明确了”，“总路线照亮了咱们前进的道路”，“过去天天闹组织起来，但不知道什么目的，现在知道就是为了对农业进行社会主义改造”。但是当接触到具体工作，比如动员农民把余粮卖给国家的问题时，有的人又感觉有困难。经过仔细算账、对比之后，情绪又高了，更高了，说：“这回不光大道理通了，小道理也通了”，“多谢毛主席把我们从三岔路口拉回来了”，“坚决要完成党所分配的任务”。许多地区的农村工作，就这样得到了胜利开展的保证。
    要开好区乡干部和党员的会议，首先要作好关于党的总路线的报告，使干部、党员大体上懂得为什么要走社会主义的道路，怎样来走社会主义的道路。这个报告不仅要从大道理上来说明问题；而且要从农民切身利益、切身经验来说明这些问题。许多地区为了作好这个报告，事前派出干部深入乡村调查干部、党员和群众的思想情况，农民生产和生活情况，并选择其中典型的事例来充实自己的报告。在报告之前，又向骨干分子征求意见，加以修正。这样报告的好处，就是它把党的总路线与干部、党员的切身经验密切联系起来了，说服力大，容易为大家接受。它发挥了四年来工作中的积极因素，避免在干部中造成“过去走错了路”的错觉，更加提高大家前进的勇气。它把党的总路线和当前各项重要工作联系起来，引导大家联系自己的生产、生活及思想等问题来进行讨论，特别是对小农经济等问题进行讨论。
    党的总路线传达之后，就要组织到会干部、党员进行讨论。各种思想问题会在讨论中暴露出来。比如在讨论国家工业化问题时，就有人提出：农业应当是国家建设的重点。所以有这样不同的意见，是因为许多干部因为长期在农村工作，很多基层干部本身就是农民出身，他们不自觉地用小农经济观点来了解党的总路线，这是并不奇怪的。在这种情况下，党组织的责任不是采取简单粗鲁的方式，给这些同志戴几个“小农经济观点”、“资本主义思想”、“落后”、“保守”等帽子，而应耐心地领导大家进行自由的切实的讨论，鼓励大家自由地思想，大胆地提出问题。在大量暴露思想之后，围绕几个关键问题进行讨论。思想问题暴露得越多，解决问题越彻底。
    怎样组织讨论呢？江苏省松江县的干部扩大会议和其他地区的三级干部会都创造了很好的经验。这些经验对于一个乡一个村的干部会议或党员会议同样是适用的。他们通过回忆对比，就四年来国家伟大成就和农民得到的好处算了几笔账。这就使干部认识了过去四年来的工作，都是遵循着党的总路线而进行的。讨论中，大家体会得最深刻的是产量年年提高。比如，松江县刚解放时平均每亩产量还不到四百斤，一九五一年增产至四百五十斤，一九五二年的产量接近五百斤，今年已经超过了五百斤了；全县耕牛增加了一万五千多头，猪仔增加了五万八千多只。由于生产的迅速恢复和发展，农民生活就得到改善。长楼乡吴家桥村一百八十四户中，刚解放时只有十八户吃“二干一稀”，其余都吃稀、吃糠、吃番瓜，现在已有一百十四户吃“二干一稀”。农民生活上的这种改善又是与工业品的价格降低分不开的。解放前要两石米做一套单衣，现在只要一石米就能做起来；解放前一斗米换一斤煤油，现在可以换到五斤煤油。从今年与去年的价格比较，农民得到的好处也很大。如以全县合作社今年卖出的铁锅、龙头细布、肥皂、生油、纱、红糖、食盐、麻皮八项东西计算，比去年的价格便宜了约一百十八亿元，拿这些钱去买耕牛，就可买到一万一千七百九十多头，买抽水机就可买到一百十八部。这种对比算账，就使到会干部认清了四年来农民所以能够得到这些好处，是由于党的总路线的胜利；是由于工业对农业的支持；是由于国家的社会主义因素的增长。这样，便把农民所得到的种种好处，和总路线联系起来，鼓舞了他们建设社会主义的信心。
    在初步认识了总路线的胜利和社会主义的道路之后，再进行两条道路的教育。揭小农经济的短，诉小农经济的苦，成为提高基层干部阶级觉悟的中心环节。松江县干部扩大会议上，发动大家讨论了“过去想富，为什么富不了”的问题。在讨论中，干部就很自然地回忆到解放以前的苦处，枫泾区王钱乡一千一百户中，只发了五户富农，二户地主。这个乡的农会副主任十一岁死了父亲，没钱埋葬，姊姊做了童养媳，妹妹送给别人抚养，弟弟死掉，自己当了七年雇工，娶了老婆，买了耕牛，自己种田，但隔不多久，老婆死了，又穷困下去，直到土地改革才翻了身。这样，大家很自然地得出一个结论：“走老路发财，数不到我们种田的，过去发财的不是伪军官，就是大恶霸，不是伪乡长，就是投机商人。勤俭农民起五更，半夜睡，还糊不了口，祖祖辈辈想‘黄金万两’，但总是发不了财。”这就使大家从切身经验中认识了小农经济经不起风吹雨打，小农经济必定是“苦死千家，发财一家”。因而摆在农民面前唯一的光明大道，只有走社会主义的道路。
    在这个思想基础上，再进一步讨论怎样走社会主义道路的问题。首先是从对比今天苏联人民幸福的生活和对比农民解放前后的生活着手，进一步搞通要集体致富，要依靠工业化，要依靠农业的合作化，要依靠工农联盟的思想。比如松江县干部在讨论中，深刻体会到的是今年的抗旱斗争，因为有政府支援了戽水机，收成就没有降低。城东区五龙乡干部还算了这样一笔账：如果今年该乡有戽水机，每亩一定可以再多打五十斤粮食，全乡就可多打四十三万斤。经过这样对比算账，实现社会主义工业化，变成了到会干部的自觉要求。为了帮助到会干部加深对工业化的理解，松江县委还举办了展览会，运用各种图表、实物和模型，用对比算账的方法，反映了解放后生产资料的增加，农民生活改善以及农产品交换工业品比价的提高，并组织干部参观了工厂。在干部对社会主义工业化有了较深的理解的基础上，进一步使干部明确认识在农村中发展互助合作，做好收购粮食工作，就是走社会主义道路所采取的具体步骤。
    为了使大家划清社会主义和资本主义思想界限，为了更深刻地领会总路线，必须由领导干部带头进行一次自上而下的思想检查。从各地所揭发的情况来看，近年来农村资本主义自发势力的发展是很严重的，许多干部、党员受到了它的影响和侵蚀，党的工作受到了它的破坏和损害。检查思想就要结合检查各项工作，检查过去的工作，有那些离开了党的总路线？有那些发展了资本主义？在许多地区的干部会议上，在负责干部检查自己的思想和工作之后，到会的干部、党员都自觉地揭发了自己的资本主义思想。但应当注意的是，干部、党员中的资本主义思想影响是盲目的，是不自觉的，也和上级过去缺乏经常的进行社会主义教育有关系；一经说清楚，大家就会自动地抛掉这种思想影响；即使有严重错误的同志，也有不少是属于盲目的。因此，对这些干部和党员必须坚持教育提高的方针，不能采取打击、嘲笑或其他方针。这就是要坚持毛泽东同志指示的方针：“第一是‘惩前毖后’，第二是‘治病救人’。对以前的错误一定要揭发，不讲情面，要以科学的态度来分析批判过去的坏东西，以便使后来的工作慎重些，做得好些。这就是‘惩前毖后’的意思。但是我们揭发错误、批判缺点的目的，好像医生治病一样，完全是为了救人，而不是为了把人整死。”“任何犯错误的人，只要他不讳疾忌医，不固执错误，以至于达到不可救药的地步，而是老老实实，真正愿意医治，愿意改正，我们就要欢迎他，把他的毛病治好，使他变为一个好同志。这个工作决不是痛快一时，乱打一顿，所能奏效的。对待思想上的毛病和政治上的毛病，决不能采用鲁莽的态度，必须采用‘治病救人’的态度，才是正确有效的方法”。（“整顿党的作风”）
    为了开好区乡干部会议，教育区乡干部彻底懂得国家过渡时期的总路线，各级领导干部必须亲自组织和指导这些会议的进行。这是一个艰巨的任务。但是，只要各级领导干部能够按照上述原则和经验去进行，那末会议一定是会开得成功的。
