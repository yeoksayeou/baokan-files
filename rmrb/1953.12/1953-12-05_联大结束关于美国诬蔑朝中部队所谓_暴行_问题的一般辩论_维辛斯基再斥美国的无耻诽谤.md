Xinhua News Agency, New York, December 4th: The United Nations General Assembly concluded on December 2nd the general debate on the issue raised by the US delegation concerning the alleged "atrocities" committed by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army against "UN forces" prisoners of war, according to TASS.

At the meeting on the 2nd, the head of the Ukrainian delegation, Mr. Baranovsky, stated that the intention of the US aggressive forces in raising the so-called "atrocities" issue in the General Assembly was to incite hostility and hatred towards the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China. It was to concentrate efforts on creating new obstacles to hinder the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue at a time when the possibility of reaching an agreement on resolving the Far East issue had become apparent. It was to further heighten international tension in order to facilitate the expansion of the Cold War and accelerate the arms race.

The Ukrainian representative said that the US military command itself had committed appalling crimes against the Korean people and the Korean-Chinese prisoners of war.

The Ukrainian representative said that the inclusion of this fabricated case on the agenda of the General Assembly was directly related to the recent intensified US propaganda of hostility and hatred towards the Soviet Union and other democratic countries. The Ukrainian government responds to this American conspiracy aimed at worsening the international situation by strengthening the struggle for peace and international cooperation.

The head of the Belarussian delegation, Mr. Kiselev, emphasized that the so-called "atrocities" issue vividly illustrates how vile and shameless slander and fabrications are being employed by those who want to further strain the current international situation and complicate the resolution of major international issues, particularly the Korean issue. It is by no means accidental that the General Assembly is being forced to discuss such a sensational issue when the fate of the Korean political conference is pending.

US representative Lodge spoke, and he did not address a single word to the accusations and facts listed by Vyshinsky. Lodge also avoided responding to the attacks from other delegations. He simply slandered the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. He asked whether the Soviet Union agreed to establish a committee composed of the International Red Cross to "investigate" the "facts" about "atrocities."

Vyshinsky stated that the US representative's proposal to establish a committee to "investigate" the "facts" about "atrocities" was purely deceptive. Lodge was not seriously considering any investigation. If the US government genuinely believed it was necessary to conduct such an investigation, why did it not accept the proposals submitted to the Security Council in August and September 1950? And why did it ignore the Soviet Union's request that the Security Council take measures to investigate the atrocities committed by the US armed forces against the Korean people and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army? Vyshinsky continued, if the United States sincerely wanted to conduct such an investigation, it would have had countless opportunities to propose the establishment of a committee and to have a truly impartial international committee conduct the investigation.

Vyshinsky urged the representatives to note that Lodge was doing everything possible to avoid answering the accusations of the Soviet delegation and some other delegations, which exposed the fabrications, distortions, and baseless claims in the US "report" on the "atrocities" issue. Vyshinsky emphasized that the US representative and some other representatives who supported him were making slanderous attacks on the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea precisely because they had failed to prove that the Korean-Chinese side had committed so-called atrocities against "UN forces" prisoners of war.

The representatives of Uruguay, the Philippines, and Peru spoke in the discussion, repeating the US representative's slanderous remarks against China and Korea. It is noteworthy that even they made absolutely no mention of the "report" that the United States presented to the General Assembly on this defamatory accusation, nor its self-contradictory and bankrupt claims.

### 联大结束关于美国诬蔑朝中部队所谓“暴行”问题的一般辩论  维辛斯基再斥美国的无耻诽谤

    联大结束关于美国诬蔑朝中部队所谓“暴行”问题的一般辩论
    维辛斯基再斥美国的无耻诽谤
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会全体会议于十二月二日结束了关于美国代表团提出的所谓朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军对“联合国军”战俘施行“暴行”的问题的一般辩论。
    在二日会议上，乌克兰代表团团长巴拉诺夫斯基发言说，美国侵略势力在大会提出所谓“暴行”问题的用意，就是要挑起对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国的敌意和仇恨，就是要在就解决远东问题获致协议的可能性已经很明显的时候，集中力量来制造新的障碍阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决，就是要使国际局势更加紧张，以便于扩大冷战和加速扩军。
    乌克兰代表说，美军司令部自己才对朝鲜人民和朝中战俘犯下了骇人听闻的罪行。
    乌克兰代表说，这个捏造出来的案件列入大会议程一事，是与近来美国加紧进行的对苏联和其他民主国家的敌意和仇恨宣传有直接联系的。乌克兰政府以加强争取和平与国际合作的斗争，来回答美国这种旨在恶化国际局势的阴谋。
    白俄罗斯代表团团长基谢列夫着重指出，所谓“暴行”问题突出地说明：那些想使目前国际局势更加紧张、使国际主要问题首先是朝鲜问题的解决趋于复杂化的人们，是采取了多么下流无耻的诽谤与捏造手段。当朝鲜政治会议的命运正待决定的时候，强要大会讨论这样一个耸人听闻的问题绝不是偶然的。
    美国代表洛奇发言，他对维辛斯基所提出的指责和所列举的事实一个字也没有谈到。洛奇也避不答复其它代表团的抨击。他一味对苏联、中华人民共和国与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国进行诽谤。他问：苏联是否同意建立一个由国际红十字会组成的委员会来“调查”关于“暴行”的“事实”。
    维辛斯基发言说，美国代表所提出的建立一个委员会来“调查”关于“暴行”的“事实”的提案，纯系欺骗性质。洛奇并不是认真地想进行任何调查。假如美国政府真正认为有必要进行这种调查的话，它为什么不接受一九五○年八月与九月提交安全理事会的建议呢？又为什么对于苏联要求安全理事会采取措施来调查美国武装部队对朝鲜人民与中国人民志愿军所犯暴行的建议置之不理呢？维辛斯基接着说，假如美国真心想进行这样一次调查的话，它已经有过无数次机会可以建议成立一个委员会，并由一个真正公正的国际委员会来进行调查了。
    维辛斯基促请代表们注意：洛奇千方百计地避不答复苏联代表团与其他一些代表团的指责，它们揭发了美国关于“暴行”问题“报告”中的捏造、歪曲与无中生有的地方。维辛斯基着重指出，美国代表与其它一些支持他的代表，所以要对苏联、中华人民共和国与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国进行诽谤性的攻击，正是因为他们未能证明朝中方面对“联合国军”战俘施行了所谓暴行。
    乌拉圭、菲律宾和秘鲁代表在讨论中发言，重复了美国代表对中朝两国的诽谤谰言。值得注意的是，甚至他们都完全没有提到美国就这个诽谤性控告向大会提出的“报告”，以及其中的自相矛盾的，已经破产的说法。
