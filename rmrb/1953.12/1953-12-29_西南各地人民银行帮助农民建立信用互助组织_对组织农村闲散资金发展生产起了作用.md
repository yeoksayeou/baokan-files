People's Banks in the Southwest region have helped peasants in various locations pilot the establishment of numerous rural credit cooperatives and credit mutual aid groups over the past few years, playing a significant role in organizing idle rural funds to develop agricultural production.

When assisting peasants in establishing credit mutual aid organizations, People's Banks in various locations in the Southwest region generally publicized and implemented principles such as "voluntary membership," "mutual benefit of savings and loans," "democratic management," and "serving production." Organizational forms were divided into two types, credit mutual aid groups and credit cooperatives, depending on the conditions. Credit mutual aid groups were formed with one or several agricultural production mutual aid teams, or a natural village as a unit, with a small scope and relatively simple business; credit cooperatives were formed with one village, one township, or several townships as a unit, with a wide scope and more business content.

After the establishment of these credit mutual aid organizations, they played a significant role in organizing idle rural funds, helping peasants overcome difficulties in production and life, and fighting against usury. For example, since its establishment in June last year, the Zhongxing Township Rural Credit Cooperative in Luxian County, Sichuan Province, has absorbed more than 690 million yuan in farmers' surplus funds and issued more than 190 million yuan in agricultural and sideline loans. After obtaining loans, farmers added 42 head of cattle, 388 pigs, more than 2.83 million catties of fertilizer, and 155 pieces of farm tools, enabling many farmers to overcome production difficulties. After the land reform, the private lending interest rate in this township had been as high as 50 percent. After the establishment of the credit cooperative, farmers mutually adjusted production funds through the credit cooperative, which effectively打击 [dǎ jī - to strike, to hit, to attack, to crack down on] the usurers and reversed the situation. The Yuantianba Rural Credit Cooperative in Tongzi County, Guizhou Province, organized the release of more than 170 million yuan in loans, which played a significant role in helping local farmers with spring plowing and fertilization, and overcoming summer famine difficulties. From May to July this year alone, the living loans released could buy more than 33,800 catties of corn, helping more than 300 farmers solve the problem of food shortage. The Xiayanglang Village Credit Mutual Aid Group in Jihua Township, Chengjiang County, Yunnan Province, organized idle funds during the spring plowing this year and timely released more than 2 million yuan in loans, enabling many farmers in the village to add fertilizer and farm tools and carry out spring plowing in a timely manner, which was warmly welcomed by the local farmers.

Because they meet the needs of farmers and can help them solve difficulties, credit mutual aid organizations in various parts of the Southwest region are called "their own small banks" by many farmers. At present, farmers in many areas are requesting the People's Bank to continue to help them establish credit mutual aid organizations.

### 西南各地人民银行帮助农民建立信用互助组织  对组织农村闲散资金发展生产起了作用

    西南各地人民银行帮助农民建立信用互助组织
    对组织农村闲散资金发展生产起了作用
    西南区各地人民银行几年来协助各地农民重点试办了不少农村信用合作社及信用互助组，对组织农村闲散资金发展农业生产起了不小作用。
    西南各地人民银行在帮助农民建立信用互助组织时，一般都宣传并贯彻了“入社自愿”、“存放两利”、“民主管理”及“服务生产”等原则。组织形式，根据条件的不同，分为信用互助组和信用合作社两种。信用互助组以一个或几个农业生产互助组，或者一个自然村为单位组成，范围小，业务比较单纯；信用合作社以一个村、一个乡或几个乡为单位组成，范围广，业务内容也较多。
    这些信用互助组织建立以后，在组织农村闲散资金，帮助农民克服生产和生活上的困难，以及向高利贷进行斗争等方面起了不小的作用。如四川省泸县中兴乡农村信用合作社从去年六月成立以来，共吸收农民余款六亿九千多万元，贷出农业和副业贷款一亿九千多万元。农民贷款后添置了耕牛四十二头、猪三百八十八只、肥料二百八十三万多斤、农具一百五十五件，使很多农民克服了生产上的困难。土地改革后，这个乡的私人借贷利息率曾高达百分之五十，信用合作社成立后，农民通过信用合作社互相调剂生产资金，便有力地打击了高利贷者，扭转了这种情况。贵州省桐梓县元田坝农村信用合作社组织投放了一亿七千多万元贷款，对当地农民春耕施肥、克服夏荒困难起了不小作用。仅今年五月到七月间投放的生活贷款可买苞谷三万三千八百多斤，帮助三百多户农民解决了缺粮的问题。云南省澄江县吉花乡下秧郎村信用互助组，在今年春耕时组织了闲散资金，及时投放了二百多万元的贷款，使该村很多农民添制了肥料和农具，及时进行了春耕，受到了当地农民的热烈欢迎。
    西南各地信用互助组织由于适合农民需要，能帮助农民解决困难，许多农民把它们叫做“自己的小银行”。目前，不少地区的农民正要求人民银行继续帮助他们建立信用互助组织。
