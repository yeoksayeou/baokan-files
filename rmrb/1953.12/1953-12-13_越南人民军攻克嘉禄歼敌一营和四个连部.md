    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, December 11th: A communiqué issued on the 10th stated that the Vietnamese People's Army, in capturing the French army's important stronghold of Gia Loc in Hai Duong province, completely annihilated a Moroccan battalion and four company headquarters.

    Gia Loc is located seven kilometers south of Hai Duong province's capital, between Hanoi and Hai Phong, and is defended by two companies of the enemy's 4th Moroccan Regiment. On the evening of December 5th, the People's Army launched an attack on Gia Loc, completely annihilating the defending enemy troops. The commander of the enemy's 12th Company, Camus, was killed, and the commander of the 4th Company, Arden, was captured.

    On the morning of the 6th, the French army sent the remaining troops of the 3rd Battalion of the 4th Moroccan Regiment, totaling three companies, from the capital of Hai Duong province, supported by tanks and armored vehicles, to counterattack Gia Loc. The People's Army intercepted this enemy force, and after a 20-minute battle, completely routed the enemy, annihilating one company and capturing another. All five of the enemy's tanks and armored vehicles were also destroyed. Major Gripon, commander of the 1st Company of the 3rd Moroccan Regiment, Captain Padang, and one captain and one lieutenant, commanders of the 9th Company of the same battalion, were all killed by the People's Army.

    In the two-day battle to attack Gia Loc, the People's Army destroyed a total of eight enemy tanks and armored vehicles, and captured two 81mm mortars, three rocket launchers, five heavy machine guns, twenty-two light machine guns, and over one hundred submachine guns and rifles.

    The General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army decided to award the Second Class Military Merit Medal to the Vietnamese People's Army units that participated in the victorious battle of Gia Loc.

    Xinhua News Agency, December 12th: The French invading forces, after suffering a disastrous defeat southwest of Ninh Binh and retreating to the Red River Delta, have again suffered heavy losses from frequent attacks by the People's Army in the provinces of Vinh Phuc, Ha Dong, Hung Yen, and Nam Dinh.

    According to the Vietnam News Agency, in the one month ending November 15th, the People's Army killed, wounded, and captured 936 enemy troops in Vinh Phuc province, northwest of Hanoi, and seized many weapons.

    On December 1st, People's Army units counterattacked the enemy's "mopping-up" operations in the Gio Trai and Tham Long areas, 40 kilometers south of Hanoi, almost completely annihilating one company of the 1st Battalion of the 1st Moroccan Regiment, and dispersing two other companies. The People's Army captured 15 light machine guns and submachine guns, and 15 rifles.

    The proportion of enemy troops captured by the People's Army in capturing enemy strongholds is increasing. For example, in mid-November, when the People's Army captured an enemy stronghold in the territory of Van Giang County, Hung Yen Province, they killed two enemy soldiers, captured 99, and seized all of the enemy's weapons, more than 100 pieces. On December 6th, the People's Army also captured the Phu Luu stronghold, 14 kilometers north of the capital of Thai Binh Province, killing 10 enemy soldiers and capturing 35.

    Attacks by guerrillas on the French army's lines of communication are becoming increasingly frequent. On December 3rd alone, guerrillas destroyed an enemy truck on Highway 21 between Phu Ly and Nam Dinh, killing 28 enemy soldiers, including two lieutenants.
