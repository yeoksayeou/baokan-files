    Northeastern Region State-Owned Department Store System Organizes Inventory Exchange
    Strengthening Rural Supply and Expanding Urban Sales
    The Northeastern Region State-Owned Department Store System organized a region-wide inventory exchange and adjustment work in late October. At this exchange meeting, wholesale stations in various provinces and cities mutually adjusted commodities worth 45.4 billion yuan, transferring unsalable or excessive stockpiles in one region to another region where they were marketable, reducing capital occupation. At the same time, the role of inventory commodities was brought into play to cooperate with grain purchase and guarantee supply.
    Due to certain blind spots in the procurement, allocation, and organization of processing by state-owned department stores in various regions, about one-tenth of the inventory in various regions is unsalable. However, these commodities are not fundamentally unsaleable; many of them are high-end goods needed by cities but stockpiled in rural areas, while mass-market goods suitable for rural areas are stockpiled in cities. In some cases, there is a surplus in one area and a shortage in another. For example, two wholesale stations in Rehe Province had a batch of high-grade drafting instruments in stock, but because there were fewer factory and mining design departments locally, they could not be sold, while Shenyang and Harbin lacked these goods. A batch of mud teapots purchased by the Shenyang wholesale station from within the customs (关内, i.e. the rest of China), had also been stockpiled in the warehouse for more than a year because they were not very suitable for urban needs.
    Based on the needs of the peak season market and the requirements of increasing production and practicing economy, the Northeastern Region Department Store organized provincial and municipal companies and wholesale stations to conduct an inter-regional inventory exchange. At this meeting, high-grade drafting instruments and other commodities worth more than 2.4 billion yuan from the Rehe Province State-Owned Department Store were transferred to large and medium-sized cities such as Shenyang and Harbin. The 8,000 mud teapots stored in Shenyang were allocated to rural areas such as Baichengzi and Suihua. In addition, 2,000 dozens of coarse yarn socks were transferred to the Liaoxi Province State-Owned Department Store. The total value of goods transferred from the Shenyang wholesale station to various places reached more than 11.3 billion yuan. Wholesale stations in rural areas such as Baichengzi transferred surplus woolen fabrics, silks, etc., to Dalian, Shenyang and other places, totaling more than 68,000 meters. In line with the spirit of mutual support, the provincial and municipal companies and wholesale stations also took out some surplus, well-selling goods to support the needs of fraternal units at this meeting. For example, the Shenyang wholesale station transferred more than 2,000 handcart tires and bicycle tires to the Jinzhou wholesale station.
    Currently, the commodities being mutually adjusted between the provincial and municipal companies and wholesale stations are being shipped. The handcart tires shipped from Shenyang to Jinzhou have already begun to be displayed in stores for sale. The commodities transferred from the southern region to the grain-producing areas of Heilongjiang and Songjiang provinces are also being shipped one after another. (Li Jiyao)

    东北区国营百货系统组织库存交流
    加强农村供应扩大城市推销
    东北区国营百货系统在十月下旬组织了一次全区性的库存积压物资交流调剂工作。在这次交流会上，各省市批发站相互调剂了价值四百五十四亿元的商品，使在一地区不适销或过多的积压货调到另一个适销的地区，减少了资金占压；同时也发挥了库存商品的作用，以配合购粮保证供应。
    各地国营百货公司由于进货、调拨和组织加工中都存在某些盲目性，所以各地库存中约有十分之一是不适销的。但是，这些商品并不是根本不能销售的，其中有不少是城市需要的高档货压在农村，而农村适销的大路货却又压在城市。有的是一地多余、一地不足。譬如，热河省的两个批发站存着一批高级制图仪器，因为当地厂矿设计部门较少，所以卖不出去，而沈阳、哈尔滨却缺少这种货。沈阳批发站，从关内采购进来的一批泥壶，也因为不太适合城市需要而积压在仓库里已一年多。
    根据旺季的市场需要，以及增产节约的要求，东北区百货公司组织各省市公司、批发站进行了一次地区间的库存交流。在这次会议上，将热河省国营百货公司价值二十四亿多元的高级制图仪器等商品分别调给沈阳、哈尔滨等大中城市。沈阳存的八千个泥壶拨给了白城子、绥化等农村。另外有二千打粗线袜子调给了辽西省国营百货公司。从沈阳批发站调给各地的商品总值即达一百一十三亿多元。农村地区的白城子等批发站将多余的毛料子、绸缎等调给了旅大、沈阳等地，共达六万八千多公尺。这次会议根据互相支援的精神，省市公司、批发站间也将一部分多余的好销货拿出来支持了兄弟单位的需要。譬如沈阳批发站就调给锦州批发站两千多条手推车胎和自行车胎。
    目前，各省市公司、批发站间互相调剂的商品正在发运。由沈阳运到锦州的手推车胎已经开始摆在商店里出售。由南部地区调剂给黑龙江、松江两产粮地区的商品，也正在陆续运送中。（李继尧）
