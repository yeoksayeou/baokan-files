Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 24th, TASS dispatch from Moscow on the 24th: Moscow newspapers today published the notification of the Special Tribunal of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union regarding the secret trial of the criminal case of Beria and Merkulov, etc. The full text is as follows:

From December 18 to 23, 1953, the Special Tribunal of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union secretly tried the criminal case of Beria et al. based on the law enacted on December 1, 1934. The composition of the Special Tribunal of the Supreme Court was as follows: President of the Special Tribunal: Marshal of the Soviet Union I.S. Konev, Judges of the Special Tribunal: Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions N.M. Shvernik, First Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union Ye.L. Zeytin, General K.S. Moskalenko, Secretary of the Moscow Regional Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union N.A. Mikhailov, Chairman of the Trade Union Council of the Georgian Republic M.I. Kuchava, President of the Moscow City Court L.A. Gromov, First Deputy Minister of the Interior of the Soviet Union K.F. Lunev.

According to the indictment, the defendants on trial were: L.B. Beria, guilty of crimes listed in Article 58, Section 1b, Article 58, Section 8, Article 58, Section 13, and Article 58, Section 11 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic; V.N. Merkulov, V.G. Dekanozov, B.Z. Kobulov, S.A. Goglidze, P.Ya. Meshik, and L.Ye. Vlodzimirsky, guilty of crimes listed in Article 58, Section 1b, Article 58, Section 8, and Article 58, Section 11 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.

The court's trial fully confirmed the interrogation materials and the crimes of each defendant constituting the indictment.

The court determined that the defendant Beria betrayed the motherland, served the interests of foreign capital, and organized a gang of treasonous conspirators against the Soviet state. These conspirators, who had colluded with Beria for many years to carry out criminal activities, were: the defendants V.N. Merkulov, V.G. Dekanozov, B.Z. Kobulov, S.A. Goglidze, P.Ya. Meshik, and L.Ye. Vlodzimirsky. The evil purpose of these conspirators was to use the institutions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs to oppose the Communist Party and the Soviet government, to place the Ministry of Internal Affairs above the Party and the government, in order to seize power, disintegrate the worker-peasant Soviet system, restore capitalism, and restore the rule of the bourgeoisie.

The court determined that L.B. Beria began his criminal treasonous activities as early as during the civil war, establishing secret contacts with foreign intelligence agencies. In 1919, L.B. Beria committed treason in Baku, acting as a special agent in the intelligence agency of the Azerbaijani Musavat counter-revolutionary government controlled by the British intelligence agency.

In 1920, L.B. Beria committed treason again in Georgia, establishing secret contacts with the secret police of the Georgian Menshevik government, which was a branch of the British intelligence agency.

In subsequent years, until his arrest, L.B. Beria continued to maintain and expand his secret contacts with foreign intelligence agencies.

For many years, L.B. Beria and his accomplices carefully concealed and disguised their hostile activities.

After the death of J.V. Stalin, L.B. Beria, relying on the general intensification of the anti-Soviet state activities of reactionary imperialist forces, began to intensify his activities in order to realize his anti-Soviet treasonous conspiracy. This enabled L.B. Beria and his accomplices to be exposed in a short period of time, and their crimes to be liquidated.

In March 1953, after the defendant L.B. Beria took office as the Minister of the Interior of the Soviet Union, he planned to seize power and began to try his best to place members of his conspiracy group in leading positions in the central and local institutions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. L.B. Beria and his accomplices persecuted honest staff members of the Ministry of Internal Affairs who refused to carry out the criminal instructions of these conspirators.

In order to achieve their anti-Soviet treasonous goals, L.B. Beria and his accomplices took many criminal measures to make the remnants of bourgeois-nationalist elements in the various union republics rampant, and to create enmity and hatred among the various nationalities of the Soviet Union, first and foremost to undermine the friendship between the various nationalities of the Soviet Union and the great Russian people.

The mortal enemy of the Soviet people, the defendant L.B. Beria, in order to create food difficulties in our country, further sabotaged and hindered the implementation of many of the most important measures formulated by the Party and the government aimed at developing the economy of collective farms and state farms and continuously improving the welfare of the Soviet people.

It has now been determined that the defendant Beria and his accomplices, in order to conceal and disguise their criminal activities and fearing that others would expose them, carried out terrorist persecution against certain people. One of the main means by which the conspirators carried out criminal activities was to use false accusations, intrigues, and various methods of framing to deal with those loyal Party and Soviet organs who hindered L.B. Beria and his accomplices' anti-Soviet state treasonous conspiracies and hindered their seizure of power.

The court determined that the defendants L.B. Beria, V.N. Merkulov, V.G. Dekanozov, B.Z. Kobulov, S.A. Goglidze, P.Ya. Meshik, and L.Ye. Vlodzimirsky, taking advantage of their positions in the People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs, the State Security Department, and various institutions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, committed many serious crimes with the aim of killing honest cadres who were loyal to the cause of the Communist Party and the Soviet regime.

The court also determined other crimes of L.B. Beria, proving that he was a morally extremely degenerate person, and also determined facts about Beria's selfish and criminal activities and abuse of power.

All the crimes charged against the defendants have been fully confirmed in court by original documents, physical evidence, the defendants' handwritten records, and the testimonies of many witnesses.

The crimes confirmed by these evidences of the defendants L.B. Beria, V.N. Merkulov, V.G. Dekanozov, B.Z. Kobulov, S.A. Goglidze, P.Ya. Meshik, and L.Ye. Vlodzimirsky confirmed the confessions they made during the interrogation during the trial, and confessed to a series of extremely serious treasonous crimes.

The Special Tribunal of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union determined that the crimes of the defendant L.B. Beria were: betraying the motherland; organizing an anti-Soviet conspiracy group in an attempt to seize power and restore bourgeois rule; carrying out terrorist persecution against political activists loyal to the Communist Party and the various nationalities of the Soviet Union; and actively sabotaging the Baku workers' revolutionary movement in 1919, when Beria acted as a special agent in the intelligence agency of the Azerbaijani Musavat counter-revolutionary government and established contact with foreign intelligence agencies; in subsequent years, until he was exposed and arrested, he continued to maintain and expand his criminal secret contacts with these foreign intelligence agencies; that is, he committed crimes listed in Article 58, Section 1b, Article 58, Section 8, Article 58, Section 13, and Article 58, Section 11 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.

The Special Tribunal determined that the crimes of the defendants V.N. Merkulov, V.G. Dekanozov, B.Z. Kobulov, S.A. Goglidze, P.Ya. Meshik, and L.Ye. Vlodzimirsky were: betraying the motherland, carrying out terrorist activities, participating in an anti-Soviet treasonous group, that is, committing crimes listed in Article 58, Section 1b, Article 58, Section 8, and Article 58, Section 11 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.

The Special Tribunal of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union decided: to sentence L.B. Beria, V.N. Merkulov, V.G. Dekanozov, B.Z. Kobulov, S.A. Goglidze, P.Ya. Meshik, and L.Ye. Vlodzimirsky to the supreme penalty - execution by shooting, and confiscate their private property, revoke their military titles and medals, honors, etc.

This judgment is the final judgment and cannot be appealed.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 24th, TASS dispatch from Moscow on the 24th: Soviet newspapers published the following notification on the 24th:

On December 23, according to the judgment of the Special Tribunal of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union, L.B. Beria, V.N. Merkulov, V.G. Dekanozov, B.Z. Kobulov, S.A. Goglidze, P.Ya. Meshik, and L.Ye. Vlodzimirsky have been sentenced to the supreme penalty - execution by shooting.

    苏联最高法院特别法庭
    审理判决贝利亚七人叛国案件
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十四日电：莫斯科各报今天刊载了苏联最高法院特别法庭关于秘密审理贝利亚和麦尔库洛夫等人刑事案件的通告，全文如下：
    一九五三年十二月十八日到二十三日，苏联最高法院特别法庭依据一九三四年十二月一日制订的法律，秘密审理了贝利亚等人的刑事案件。苏联最高法院特别法庭的组成如下：特别法庭审判长：苏联元帅伊·斯·科湼夫，特别法庭审判员：全苏工会中央理事会主席尼·米·什维尔尼克、苏联最高法院第一副院长叶·勒·泽伊京、大将克·斯·莫斯卡连科、苏联共产党莫斯科州委员会书记纳·阿·米哈伊洛夫、格鲁吉亚共和国工会理事会主席麦·伊·库查夫、莫斯科市法院院长勒·阿·格罗莫夫、苏联内务部第一副部长克·弗·鲁湼夫。
    根据起诉书，受审的犯人是：拉·巴·贝利亚，犯有俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国刑法第五十八条一款乙项、第五十八条八款、第五十八条十三款、第五十八条十一款所列罪行；弗·尼·麦尔库洛夫、弗·格·德卡诺佐夫、布·兹·柯布洛夫、斯·阿·戈格利泽、帕·伊·麦希克、拉·叶·弗洛齐米尔斯基，犯有俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国刑法第五十八条一款乙项、第五十八条八款、第五十八条十一款所列罪行。
    法庭的审理完全证实侦讯材料和构成提起公诉的各被告的罪行。
    法庭确定：被告贝利亚背叛祖国，为外国资本的利益服务，组织了一帮反对苏维埃国家的叛国阴谋分子，这批多年来与贝利亚相勾结共同进行罪恶活动的阴谋分子是：被告弗·尼·麦尔库洛夫、弗·格·德卡诺佐夫、布·兹·柯布洛夫、斯·阿·戈格利泽、帕·伊·麦希克、拉·叶·弗洛齐米尔斯基。这些阴谋分子所抱的罪恶目的，就是要利用内务部的机构来反对共产党和苏联政府，把内务部放在党和政府之上，以便夺取权力，瓦解工农苏维埃制度，使资本主义复辟，并恢复资产阶级的统治。
    法庭确定：还在国内战争时期，拉·巴·贝利亚就开始了他的罪恶的叛国活动，跟外国情报机关建立了秘密的联系。一九一九年，拉·巴·贝利亚在巴库就犯了叛国罪行，在英国间谍机关控制的阿塞拜疆的穆沙瓦特反革命政府的情报机关中作了特务。
      一九二○年，拉·巴·贝利亚在格鲁吉亚又一次犯了叛国罪行，跟格鲁吉亚的孟什维克政府的秘密警察建立了秘密联系，而格鲁吉亚孟什维克政府的秘密警察是英国情报机关的一个分支。
    在以后的年代中，直到被捕时为止，拉·巴·贝利亚继续维持并扩大他和外国情报机关的秘密联系。
    许多年来，拉·巴·贝利亚和他的同谋者周密地掩饰和伪装他们的敌对活动。
    约·维·斯大林逝世后，拉·巴·贝利亚指靠反动帝国主义势力的反对苏维埃国家活动的普遍加紧，开始加紧他的活动，以实现其反苏叛国的阴谋，这使拉·巴·贝利亚和他的同谋者在短时期内就被揭发，使他们的罪行受到清算。
    一九五三年三月，被告拉·巴·贝利亚担任苏联内务部部长后，就策划攫取权力，开始竭力把他的阴谋集团的成员安插在内务部的中央机构和地方机构的领导职位上。拉·巴·贝利亚和他的同谋者迫害内务部中拒绝执行这些阴谋分子的罪恶指示的正直工作人员。
    拉·巴·贝利亚和他的同谋者为了达到反苏叛国的目的，采取了许多罪恶的措施，使各加盟共和国的资产阶级—民族主义分子的残余猖獗起来，并在苏联各族人民之间制造敌意和仇恨，首先是破坏苏联各族人民和伟大的俄罗斯人民的友谊。
    苏联人民的死敌、被告拉·巴·贝利亚为了制造我国粮食困难，更破坏并阻挠党和政府所制订的旨在发展集体农庄和国营农场的经济并不断增进苏联人民福利的许多最重要的措施的执行。
    现已确定，被告贝利亚和他的同谋者为了掩饰并伪装自己的罪恶活动，害怕别人揭发他们，曾对某些人进行了恐怖迫害。阴谋分子们进行犯罪活动的主要手段之一，就是用诬告、暗算和各种陷害办法来对付那些妨害拉·巴·贝利亚及其同谋者的反苏维埃国家的叛国阴谋和妨碍他们夺取权力的忠诚的党和苏维埃机关的工作者。
    法庭确定，被告拉·巴·贝利亚、弗·尼·麦尔库洛夫、弗·格·德卡诺佐夫、布·兹·柯布洛夫、斯·阿·戈格利泽、帕·伊·麦希克和拉·叶·弗洛齐米尔斯基利用他们在内务人民委员部、国家保安部和内务部各机构中的职位，犯下了许多严重的罪行，目的是要杀害正直的、忠实于共产党和苏维埃政权的事业的干部。
    法庭还确定了拉·巴·贝利亚的另外一些罪行，证明他是道德上极其堕落的人，此外还确定了关于贝利亚进行自私自利的罪恶活动和滥用职权的事实。
    所有被告提出被控诉的罪行，已在法庭上由原始文件、物证、被告的亲笔记录和许多证人的证词全部证实。
    由这些证据证实了罪行的被告拉·巴·贝利亚、弗·尼·麦尔库洛夫、弗·格·德卡诺佐夫、布·兹·柯布洛夫、斯·阿·戈格利泽、帕·伊·麦希克和拉·叶·弗洛齐米尔斯基，在审判的过程中证实了侦讯期间他们所作的供词，并对所犯的一连串极其严重的叛国罪行供认不讳。
    苏联最高法院特别法庭确定被告拉·巴·贝利亚的罪状是：背叛祖国；组织反苏维埃的阴谋集团，以图夺取权力并恢复资产阶级统治；对忠实于共产党和苏联各族人民的政治活动家进行恐怖迫害；并在一九一九年积极破坏巴库工人革命运动，那时，贝利亚就在阿塞拜疆的穆沙瓦特反革命政府的情报机关中充当特务，并和外国情报机关建立了联系；在以后的年代中，直到被揭发并被捕时为止，他继续维持并扩大与这些外国情报机关的罪恶的秘密联系；即犯有俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国刑法第五十八条一款乙项、第五十八条八款、第五十八条十三款、第五十八条十一款所列罪行。
    特别法庭确定被告弗·尼·麦尔库洛夫、弗·格·德卡诺佐夫、布·兹·柯布洛夫、斯·阿·戈格利泽、帕·伊·麦希克和拉·叶·弗洛齐米尔斯基的罪状是：背叛祖国，进行恐怖活动，参加反苏维埃的叛国集团，即犯有俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国刑法第五十八条一款乙项、第五十八条八款和第五十八条十一款所列罪行。
    苏联最高法院特别法庭决定：将拉·巴·贝利亚、弗·尼·麦尔库洛夫、弗·格·德卡诺佐夫、布·兹·柯布洛夫、斯·阿·戈格利泽、帕·伊·麦希克和拉·叶·弗洛齐米尔斯基判处极刑——执行枪决，并没收他们的私人财产，取消军人称号和奖章、勋章等。
    本判决为最后的判决，不得上诉。
