    (I) Support the Soviet Government's Proposal to Ban Atomic Weapons
    Humankind has mastered and utilized the power of atomic energy. The possibilities of using atomic energy for both war and peaceful purposes have been discovered. However, up to now, the power of atomic energy has been mainly used for the production of atomic armaments. Furthermore, in many respects, hydrogen weapons, which surpass atomic weapons in power, have also been developed. Therefore, how to prevent the power of atomic energy from being used for mass slaughter of humans and the destruction of cities, and to ensure that it only serves peaceful needs, is a matter of universal concern for all peace-loving people today.
    The Soviet government's statement on December 21 regarding U.S. President Eisenhower's December 8 speech on the issue of atomic weapons put forward reasonable and practical suggestions for this issue of concern to mankind. The Soviet government's statement once again demonstrated its deep concern for human safety and welfare.
    Among the countries that have already mastered atomic power, only the Soviet Union has consistently dedicated itself to using atomic energy for peaceful needs and resolutely opposed the use of atomic weapons. The Soviet government has repeatedly proposed banning atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction, and believes that this is the most important and urgent issue for easing international tensions. Consultation between major powers on this matter is imperative. Now, in his December 8 speech, U.S. President Eisenhower spoke about his views on the importance of atomic weapons, and he believed that several major countries concerned could hold secret and diplomatic talks. The Soviet government expressed its willingness to participate in such talks. From this, people can see how consistently the Soviet government strives for international consultation on the issue of atomic weapons, as it does on other international issues. This is clearly another sincere action by the Soviet government to strive for easing international tensions.
    The Soviet government, in expressing its willingness to participate in the consultations proposed by the U.S. President, aims to reach an agreement among the governments of the relevant countries that have already mastered atomic weapons on the issue of no longer using atomic weapons; and it suggests that the countries participating in the agreement undertake the sacred and unconditional obligation not to use atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction. Obviously, the Soviet government's proposal is a necessary step to eliminate the threat of atomic war, and therefore it is entirely in line with the vital interests and peaceful aspirations of the people of all countries.
    In his speech, the U.S. President also talked about the importance of easing international tensions, but he did not express any opinion on the issue of banning atomic weapons. The U.S. President only put forward a suggestion that the relevant governments should start now and continue to donate "some of their stockpiles of normal uranium and fissionable materials" to an "international atomic energy agency" under the auspices of the United Nations for peaceful purposes. What does this suggestion mean? This suggestion only advocates using a small portion of atomic materials for peaceful purposes, while not placing any restrictions on the production and expansion of atomic weapons. This will undoubtedly allow the ever-increasing majority of atomic materials to continue to be used for the production of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, as in the past. This, of course, cannot solve the problem. Furthermore, this suggestion does not place any restrictions on the possibility of aggressors using atomic weapons. Therefore, public opinion in all countries believes that the U.S. President's suggestion cannot help reduce the real threat of atomic war. The British "Daily Telegraph and Morning Post" once wrote: "It would be wrong to regard Eisenhower's plan as a plan to prevent the possibility of atomic war."
    Of course, reducing the problem to merely using a small portion of atomic materials for peaceful purposes is of no important practical significance. If the relevant governments only reach an agreement on such a scope, it would relax the vigilance of the people of all countries on the issue of atomic weapons and would be tantamount to directly permitting the production of atomic weapons. This is not only not what the people of all countries expect, but it would also facilitate the aggressive forces to use atomic energy for war purposes.
    The issue is very clear: if there is true sincerity for peace, then all atomic materials must be used for peaceful purposes, not just a small portion. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to eliminate the possibility of producing and using atomic weapons. Therefore, in the consultations between the relevant governments, it is necessary to review the suggestions put forward by the Soviet government, for the governments of all countries to undertake the obligation not to use atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction, and to reach an agreement on this issue. Only in this way can a broad path be opened up for the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes.
    The Soviet government's statement and proposals have been warmly welcomed around the world. The people of all countries believe that the Soviet government's statement and proposals are another important contribution to the cause of world peace. The people of our country fully support the Soviet government's statement; the people of our country firmly believe that, with the concerted efforts of the Soviet people and the peace-loving people of the world, humanity will certainly be able to achieve the great goal of banning the use of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction. The people of our country are willing to work together with the Soviet people and the peace-loving people of all countries to fight for this goal.

### （一）拥护苏联政府禁止使用原子武器的建议

    （一）拥护苏联政府禁止使用原子武器的建议
    原子能的威力已被人类所掌握并加以利用了。利用原子能于战争目的及和平目的的可能性都被发现了。可是直到目前为止，原子能的力量主要还是被利用从事原子军备的生产。并且，除了原子武器之外，氢武器也在许多方面得到了发展，在威力上超过了原子武器。因此，如何防止原子能的威力被用于大规模屠杀人类和毁灭城市这样的目的，而使它只能为和平的需要服务，是今天所有和平人类普遍关心的问题。
    苏联政府于十二月二十一日就美国总统艾森豪威尔十二月八日关于原子武器问题的演说发表的声明，对于为人类所关心的这个问题提出了合情合理、切实可行的建议。苏联政府的这个声明，再一次表现了它对人类安全和福利的深刻关怀。
    在已经掌握原子威力的国家中，只有苏联一贯地致力于利用原子能于和平的需要，而坚决反对使用原子武器。苏联政府曾屡次建议禁止原子武器、氢武器及其他大规模毁灭性的武器，并认为这是缓和国际紧张局势的最重要和最迫切的问题，大国间对此进行协商是刻不容缓的。现在，美国总统艾森豪威尔在他的十二月八日的演说中，谈到了他对原子武器的重要性的看法，他认为几个主要的有关国家可以举行秘密的和外交上的会谈。苏联政府表示愿意参加这种会谈。人们由此可以看到，苏联政府在原子武器的问题上和在其他国际问题上一样是如何坚持不渝地为争取国际协商而努力。这显然是苏联政府争取缓和国际紧张局势的又一真诚行动。
    苏联政府在表示愿意参加美国总统所提出的商谈的目的是求得已经掌握原子武器的有关国家政府，在不再使用原子武器的问题上达成协议；并建议参加协议的各国承担起不再使用原子武器、氢武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器的神圣的、无条件的义务。显然，苏联政府的这个建议是消除原子战争威胁的必要的步骤，因而它是完全符合于各国人民的切身利益及其和平愿望的。
    美国总统在他的演说中也谈到了缓和国际紧张局势的重要性，但是他对禁止原子武器的问题却没有表示任何意见。美国总统只提出一个建议，即有关各国政府现在就开始以后并继续捐献出“一些它们储存的常态铀和可分裂物质”，交给联合国所主持的一个“国际原子能机构”，以便用于和平的目的。美国总统的这个建议意味着什么呢？这个建议只主张将一小部分原子物资利用于和平目的，同时对原子武器的生产和扩充却不加以任何限制。这无疑地将使不断增加的大部分原子物资，继续像过去一样被用于原子武器和氢武器的生产。这当然是不能解决问题的。并且，这个建议对于侵略者使用原子武器的可能性也没有加以丝毫限制。因此，各国公众舆论都认为美国总统的这个建议不能有助于减少原子战争的真正威胁。英国的“每日电讯与晨邮报”就曾写道：“如果把艾森豪威尔的计划当作是防止原子战争的可能性的计划，那就错了。”
    当然，把问题缩小成仅仅将一小部分原子物资利用于和平目的，是没有任何重要的实际意义的。如果有关国家政府仅只在这样一个范围上达成协议的话，这就会使各国人民放松对原子武器问题的警惕，并等于直接准许原子武器的生产。这不但不是各国人民所期望的，反而会便利侵略势力利用原子能于战争目的。
    问题很清楚，如果真有和平的诚意，就必须使全部原子物资用于和平的目的，而不是一小部分。要达到这个目的，就必须杜绝生产和使用原子武器的可能性。因此，在有关各国政府的商谈中，必须审查苏联政府所提出的建议，由各国政府担承起不再使用原子武器、氢武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器的义务，并在这个问题上达成协议。只有这样，才能为原子能用于和平的目的打开广阔的道路。
    苏联政府的声明和所提的建议，受到了全世界的热烈欢迎。各国人民都认为苏联政府的这个声明和建议是对世界和平事业的又一重要贡献。我国人民完全拥护苏联政府的声明；我国人民深信，在苏联人民和全世界爱好和平人民的一致努力下，人类一定能够实现禁止使用原子武器、氢武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器的伟大目标。我国人民愿意与苏联人民及各国爱好和平人民为此目标而共同奋斗。
