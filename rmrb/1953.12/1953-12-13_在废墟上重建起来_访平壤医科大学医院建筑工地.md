    Rebuilding from the Ruins
    ——A Visit to the Construction Site of Pyongyang Medical University Hospital
    Qi Yue
    On the cold morning of November 13th, after a snowfall, we crossed the misty Taedong River with reverence to visit the construction site of Pyongyang Medical University Hospital in East Pyongyang. Pyongyang Medical University is the largest medical university in North Korea, with over a thousand students. During the most difficult years of the war, they excellently completed the tasks assigned to them by the state. Two people were awarded the Second Class National Flag Order, five were awarded the Third Class National Flag Order, one was awarded the Order of Freedom and Independence, fifteen were awarded the Order of Merit, and many others were awarded Military Service Medals. After the war, they used their own hands to rebuild their school.

    As soon as we arrived, Han Cheol, the vice-president who won the Second Class National Flag Order, began to talk to us like he was greeting old friends. He said, "The task assigned by the state was to build ninety rooms from October 21st to the end of November. But our plan is to build one hundred and fifty rooms before November 20th." Completing this task was difficult: among the 130 people participating in the construction, only one was a carpenter, and none of the others understood construction techniques; there were only sixty-odd construction tools; there were no ready-made materials at all, and every piece of wood and every brick had to be dug out from the ruins. But what did these difficulties matter? If they didn't understand the technology, they would learn from the workers and peasants. If they didn't have the tools, they would create them with their own two hands. On average, they completed 200 percent of the task every day. By the time we visited, they had already built one hundred and twenty new houses.

    Vice-President Han Cheol first took us to see the hospital building that had been bombed by American planes. There, comrades of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army were carrying out cleaning work, collecting steel bars and scrap iron to build their own blacksmith furnace to cast tools and build buildings. Next spring, this three-story building, which can accommodate a thousand patients, will be rebuilt.

    Not far from the dilapidated building, through the gradually dissipating morning mist, we could see rows of newly built bungalows and some scaffolding. The songs of labor floated from there like a warm current.

    Next to a large bomb crater filled with rainwater, several young girls in thin clothes were standing barefoot in the mud pit, mixing mud. Vice-President Han Cheol pointed to one of them and said, "This girl is called Han Jeong-suk, the daughter of a poor peasant, and she is only nineteen years old this year. She is a model nurse and a model member of the Democratic Youth League in our hospital. During the war, she rescued thirty-two wounded soldiers twice under enemy bombing, and transfused 1,250 cc of blood in five months, saving the lives of six seriously injured soldiers. She simply doesn't know what fatigue is! Now, with the same tenacity as during the war, she is engaged in construction work, and the work group she leads has become a model work group."

    Vice-President Han Cheol picked up a broken brick from a pile of bricks and said, "We don't have a single complete brick, so we use these broken bricks to build houses. We can't even find these broken bricks nearby, so the comrades have to dig them out from the ruins two miles away!" He pointed to a team of women carrying bricks and said, "The thin woman in front is called Kim Jeong-ryeol, she is forty-five years old this year, the mother of four children, and a loyal member of the Workers' Party. Don't look down on her because she's old, she works just as hard as the young people. Her waist aches from digging bricks, and her hands are swollen, and sometimes she bleeds along the nail crevices, but she doesn't say a word."

    We gave her a photo of Chairman Mao, and she solemnly accepted it, with tears of gratitude in her eyes, and said to us, "Although our languages are different, our hearts are connected! Please convey our heartfelt gratitude to Chairman Mao and the Chinese people...."

    Vice-President Han Cheol led us forward a few steps, stood next to a scaffolding that had just been half-built, patted the shoulder of an old man with a black beard, and said to us, "It's all the same! This is Comrade Cui Zheng-ha, an old carpenter. A few days ago, he knocked out a tooth when he was carrying wood, and his face was also smashed. We told him to rest for a while, but he refused to. Under his leadership and guidance, he built the scaffolding for one hundred and twenty houses in fifteen days, and also trained a large number of construction workers!" We walked over and shook hands tightly with Comrade Cui Zheng-ha, and saw that half of his face was still swollen. We expressed our condolences to him. He smiled and said, "It's nothing, please tell the Chinese people: we will not let down your help and expectations, we will create happiness with our labor!"

    Vice-President Han Cheol led us around this small construction site, talking endlessly about everything he was familiar with, and everyone he loved. Here, young girls and old mothers stood in a row, singing songs, and passing mud balls from this side to that side with their hands, and then to the roof. Finally, a girl in a white coat took it over and quickly smeared the mud on the roof made of sorghum stalks.

    Vice-President Han Cheol greeted the girl in white, "Hey, Comrade Yoon Ja-im, be careful, don't fall down!" Then he turned to us and said, "A week ago, this girl transfused 200 cc of blood to a People's Army soldier who was seriously injured in the construction. The organization gave her 1,500 North Korean won as a nutrition allowance and asked her to rest for a few days. But she gave all 1,500 won to the Party dues and continued to work as usual. She said, 'I am a member of the Workers' Party, I have long sworn to dedicate my youth and life to the Party, and when the country and the people need it, I will not hesitate to give it.' This girl is really..."

    Vice-President Han Cheol didn't finish his words, when a person walking with crutches came over and continued, "She is really a good girl! But don't forget to introduce our doctor comrades to our Chinese friends, the hands that used to hold stethoscopes have learned to build walls and make kang beds. Surgeon Lee Han-woo can make four kang beds a day!"

    After Vice-President Han Cheol's introduction, we learned that this thin middle-aged man with a leg broken by bombing was President Kim Byung-ki.

    President Kim Byung-ki pointed to the rows of newly built houses in front of him and said to us with a smile, "Thanks to the hard work of these comrades, fifty families of employees will soon be able to move into these new houses for the winter. Next spring, we will plant trees, flowers, and lawns in front of the houses, and turn the large bomb crater filled with water into a beautiful pond, where we will raise ducks...."

    When we shook hands with these lovely Korean friends to say goodbye, we once again expressed our respect to these strong and optimistic people. Vice-President Han Cheol said modestly, "We are all ordinary people, and what we do are also ordinary things. But, we are the people under the leadership and education of Marshal Kim Il-sung and the Workers' Party, our strength and wisdom are infinite, and no difficulties can stop us." (Attached picture)

    在废墟上重建起来
    ——访平壤医科大学医院建筑工地
    齐越
    十一月十三日，一个雪后寒冷的早晨，我们怀着崇敬的心情，越过雾气弥漫的大同江，到东平壤去访问平壤医科大学医院的建筑工地。平壤医科大学是朝鲜规模最大的一所医科大学，全校有一千多学生。在战争最困难的年代里，他们都出色地完成了国家交给他们的任务，有两人获得了二级国旗勋章，五人获得了三级国旗勋章，一人获得了自由独立勋章，十五人获得了功劳勋章，还有很多人获得了军功章。战争结束后，他们又用自己的双手来重建自己的学校。
    我们一到那里，二级国旗勋章获得者韩哲副院长，就像接待老朋友一样跟我们畅谈起来。他说：“国家规定的任务是：从十月二十一日动工，到十一月底以前盖好九十间房子。可是我们的计划是要在十一月二十日以前就盖好一百五十间房子。”完成这样的任务是有困难的：参加建筑工作的一百三十人当中，除了一个木匠外，没有一个人懂得建筑技术；建筑工具只有六十多件；没有任何现成的材料，一根木头，一块砖都要从废墟中间挖出来。可是，这些困难算得了什么呢？不懂技术就向工人和农民学习，没有工具就用自己的两只手来创造。他们每天平均完成任务百分之二百。到我们去访问的时候，他们已经盖好了一百二十间新房子了。
    韩哲副院长首先带着我们看了被美国飞机炸毁的医院大楼。在那里，中国人民志愿军的同志们正在进行清理工作，他们把钢筋废铁搜集起来，准备自己修建一个铁匠炉铸造工具，修建楼房。明年春天，这幢可以收容一千个病人的三层楼房就要重新矗立起来了。
    离开破烂不堪的楼房不远，透过逐渐消散的晨雾，可以看见一座座新盖起来的平房和一些建筑架，劳动的歌声像温暖的气流一样从那儿飘荡过来。
    在一个积满雨水的大炸弹坑旁边，几个穿着单薄衣裳的年青姑娘，正赤着脚站在泥坑里和泥。韩哲副院长指着其中的一个说：“这位姑娘叫韩贞淑，是贫农的女儿，今年才十九岁。她是我们医院的模范护士和民主青年同盟模范盟员，战争时期曾经两次在敌机轰炸下抢救出三十二个伤员，在五个月内输血一千二百五十西西，救活了六个重伤员。她简直不知道什么叫疲倦！现在，她用和战争时期一样的坚韧精神，从事建设工作，她所领导的工作组已经成为模范工作组了。”
    韩哲副院长从一个砖堆上拿起一块破砖来说：“我们没有一块完整的砖，就用这些碎砖盖房子。就是这些碎砖在附近也找不到了，同志们要到两里地以外的废墟上去挖呢！”他指着那一队背着砖走过来的妇女说：“前面那个瘦瘦的妇女叫金贞烈，今年已经四十五岁了，是四个孩子的母亲，忠诚的劳动党党员。别看她上了岁数，干起活来可一点也不比年轻人差。挖砖挖得腰痛，两只手也肿了，有时顺着指甲缝流血，可她一声也不吭。”
    我们把一张毛主席的像片送给她，她郑重地接了过去，眼里含着感激的泪水，对我们说：“虽然我们的语言不通，我们的心可是相通的啊！请把我们心里的谢意带给毛主席和中国人民……。”
    韩哲副院长领着我们往前走了几步，站在一个刚刚搭好一半的建筑架的旁边，拍着一个黑胡子老汉的肩膀，对我们说：“都是一个样儿啊！这是老木匠崔正河同志。前几天他抬木头碰掉了一个牙齿，脸也叫砸肿了，让他休息一下，说什么也不肯。在他的带头和指导下，十五天里就搭好了一百二十间房子的建筑架，还培养出来一大批建筑工人哩！”我们走过去跟崔正河同志紧紧握手，看见他的半边脸还肿着。我们向他表示慰问。他笑着说：“没有什么，请告诉中国人民：我们不会辜负你们对我们的帮助和期望，我们要用劳动创造幸福！”
    韩哲副院长领着我们在这小小的工地上走来走去，滔滔不绝地讲述着他所熟悉的每一件事，他所热爱着的每一个人。这里，年青的姑娘和年老的母亲站成一排，唱着歌，用双手把泥团从这边传到那边，又传到房顶上。最后，由一个穿白上衣的姑娘接过去，把泥迅速地抹在高粱秆铺成的房顶上。
    韩哲副院长向那个穿白上衣的姑娘招呼说：“喂，尹滋姙同志，小心一点，可别摔下来！”然后转过头来对我们说：“一个星期前，这个姑娘给一位在建设中受重伤的人民军战士输了二百西西的血，组织上发给她一千五百元朝鲜币的补养费，让她休息几天。可是她呢，把一千五百元全都交了党费，还是跟往常一样地坚持工作。她说：‘我是劳动党党员，我早已宣誓把自己的青春和生命献给党，当国家和人民需要的时候，我是毫不吝惜的。’这个姑娘真是……”
    韩哲副院长的话没有说完，那边走过来一个拄着拐杖的人接下去说：“真是个好姑娘！可也别忘记向中国朋友介绍我们那些医生同志啊，拿听诊器的手学会了砌墙打炕，外科医生李汉宇一天能打四个炕！”
    经韩哲副院长介绍，我们才知道这位被炸断一条腿的瘦小的中年人，就是院长金秉基同志。
    金秉基院长指着面前新盖起来的一排排的房屋，微笑着对我们说：“靠着这些同志们的辛勤劳动，五十户职工家属，不久就可以搬进这些新房子里过冬了。明年春天，我们要在房子前面栽上树，种上花，铺上草地，把那个积满水的大炸弹坑也修成一个漂亮的池塘，里面养上鸭子……。”
    当我们跟这些可爱的朝鲜朋友握手告别的时候，我们再一次向这些坚强和乐观的人们表示敬意。韩哲副院长谦虚地说：“我们都是平凡的人，做的也是一些平凡的事。但是，我们是金日成元帅和劳动党领导、教育下的人民，我们的力量和智慧是无穷的，任何困难都阻挡不住我们。”（附图片）
