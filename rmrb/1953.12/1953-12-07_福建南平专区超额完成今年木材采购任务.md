Nanping Special District in Fujian Province has exceeded this year's timber procurement task. After obtaining substantial timber income, forestry farmers are actively expanding production.

This year, timber production in Nanping Special District involved 4,063 households in 265 townships across nine counties, including Nanping, Youxi, Sha County, and Gutian. Since the start of the logging season, procurement stations of the Nanping Office of the Fujian Provincial Forestry Industry Bureau in various counties have been actively conducting procurement work in forest areas. Thanks to an appropriate increase in purchase prices and the correct implementation of timber management policies this year, forestry farmers' enthusiasm for production has been high. By the end of the third quarter, the entire special district had produced over 176,000 cubic meters of timber, an increase of 53 percent compared to the planned 115,000 cubic meters. All procurement stations have exceeded their annual procurement tasks. In the third quarter, procurement stations in various counties promptly delivered over 70,000 cubic meters of timber, exceeding the original third-quarter plan by 28 percent. They are now striving to deliver over 90,000 cubic meters in the fourth quarter to ensure the overfulfillment of the annual production plan.

This year, after timber procurement in the aforementioned forest areas, forestry farmers received a total of over 17.6 billion yuan in mountain price income. In addition to this, there were substantial wage incomes from logging, material preparation, timber collection, stream release, rafting, and transportation. According to a survey, 19 boatmen households in Eyang Village, Gutian County, earned 66 million yuan just from participating in timber rafting and transportation work from July to October, with an average income of over 3.47 million yuan per household. The appropriate increase in purchase prices, the correct implementation of policies, and the mobilization of forestry farmers to support national economic construction have led to an unprecedented increase in mass afforestation enthusiasm. This year, Songxi Township, Gutian County, planted over 410,000 pine and tung oil trees each, over 1,000 fir trees, and cultivated over nine mu of various seedlings. The increase in income for the masses in forest areas has also strongly supported agricultural production.

    福建南平专区超额完成今年木材采购任务
    福建省南平专区已超额完成今年木材采购任务，林农获得大宗木材收入后，积极扩大生产。
    南平专区今年进行木材生产的包括南平、尤溪、沙县、古田等九个县二百六十五个乡的四千零六十三户。福建省森林工业局南平办事处所属各县采购站，自砍伐季节开始后，即深入林区进行采购工作。由于今年适当提高收购价格和正确贯彻了木材管理政策，林农生产情绪都很高涨，到第三季度末为止，全专区已生产木材十七万六千多立方公尺，比预定计划十一万五千多立方公尺增产了百分之五十三，各采购站均超额完成了本年度采购任务。第三季度各县采购站已及时上交木材七万多立方公尺，超过完成第三季度原订计划百分之二十八，现正争取第四季度继续交货九万多立方公尺，以保证超额完成全年生产计划。
    今年上述林区经过木材采购后，林农共计获得一百七十六亿多元的山价收入，除此以外，还有采伐、造材、集材、放溪、装排、流送等巨额工资收入。据调查，古田县莪洋村十九户船民，仅参加七月份到十月份木材装排和流送工作，便获得工资六千六百万元，每户平均收入三百四十七万多元。适当提高收购价、正确贯彻政策以及动员林农支援国家经济建设的结果，使群众造林情绪空前提高，古田嵩溪乡今年共栽植松树、油桐各四十一万多株，杉树一千多株，并培育各种幼苗九亩多。林区群众收入的增加，也有力地支持了农业生产。
