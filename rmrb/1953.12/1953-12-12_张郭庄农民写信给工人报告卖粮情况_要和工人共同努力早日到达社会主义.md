Zhang Guozhuang Farmers Write to Workers Reporting Grain Sales, Vowing to Work Together to Reach Socialism Soon

To the worker comrades of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory:

We, the entire membership of the agricultural producers' cooperative, have studied the general line of the state during the transition period and understand that the country is to implement socialist industrialization and agriculture is to undergo socialist transformation. Everyone feels enlightened and has a direction to strive towards. In order to support national construction and the production of our worker comrades with practical actions, the entire membership of our agricultural producers' cooperative has sold all of our surplus grain, more than 35,000 jin, to the state. Eighty percent of our members were poor people who couldn't get enough to eat or wear in the past. After liberation, we were allocated land and organized into mutual aid teams, and our lives gradually improved. This year, we established a cooperative, and production and life have become even better, with an average of more than 4,000 jin of grain distributed to each laborer. When we started selling grain this time, some people didn't understand the benefits of selling grain to themselves and the country. A few families who had suffered from hunger in the past were reluctant to sell the grain they had been allocated. Take member Hu Quan's mother, for example. At first, she knew that the grain couldn't be eaten all, but she didn't want to sell it. She said, "I feel more at ease with the grain at home." After studying the general line, she realized that it would be truly good to use machines to cultivate the land. This year, our production cooperative used tractors from the tractor station and tractors sent by Czechoslovakia to cultivate the land, which resulted in such a large harvest. After understanding these principles, she happily sold all of her surplus grain, more than 300 jin, to the state to support the country's industrial construction. Under the influence and leadership of our members, the whole village has now sold more than 80,000 jin of surplus grain to the state.

Our agricultural producers' cooperative was established this spring under the leadership and assistance of the Party and the government. The entire cooperative has more than 30 laborers and more than 700 mu of land. We have a tractor and a water pump sent by Czechoslovakia, as well as seeders, new-style weeders, horse-drawn plows, corn threshers, and peanut shellers awarded by the government and purchased by ourselves. In addition to our own machines, we have also signed a contract with the Beijing suburban tractor station for contracted cultivation. Our cultivation is already semi-mechanized. Plowing and sowing are all done by machine, and some of the mid-cultivation is also done by machine. Only harvesting is mostly done by manual labor. As a result of using machines for cultivation, our cooperative has changed from a shortage of labor to a surplus of labor. We used 120 workdays to accumulate fertilizer and engage in sideline production, which increased the cooperative's sideline income by more than 35 million yuan and increased the amount of fertilizer. Although millet and corn suffered from floods and windstorms this year, the average yield per mu was still dozens of jin more than that of ordinary households in the village. One hundred and thirty mu of peanuts, because they were mixed with rhizobia, averaged 294 jin per mu, which was 96 jin more per mu than the average of the whole village outside the cooperative. Worker comrades, these are things we never dreamed of in the past. Without the country's industrialization, without your hard work in manufacturing machines, and without agricultural producers' cooperatives, we could never have achieved these things.

Worker comrades of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, our cooperative has two of the latest three-pronged weeders manufactured by you. They are clean when weeding, do not harm the roots, and can also cultivate the soil. One animal and two people can weed 20 mu a day. When we weeded the cornfields twice, we saved 100 workdays on more than 200 mu of land and seized the opportune time. This weeder is one of our most favorite farm tools. Here, we would like to specifically inform you of this situation and express our gratitude to you.

After studying the general line this time, all of our members realize that only when the country's industry develops can farmers obtain new farm tools and cheap industrial products. In addition to selling all of our surplus grain to the state, we also plan to use our surplus money to purchase "1954 National Economic Construction Bonds" so that the country can build more factories and produce more electricity and machines. All of our members guarantee to you that we will lead the peasants in the whole village to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation, strive to increase grain production, and support industrial construction. Our request to you is to manufacture more new farm tools to help us develop production. Let us work together to strive to reach socialism soon!

The entire membership of the Zhang Guozhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative, Fengtai District, Beijing Municipality

### 张郭庄农民写信给工人报告卖粮情况  要和工人共同努力早日到达社会主义

    张郭庄农民写信给工人报告卖粮情况
    要和工人共同努力早日到达社会主义华北农业机械总厂的工人同志们：
    我们农业生产合作社的全体社员，学习了国家过渡时期总路线，知道国家要实行社会主义工业化，农业也要进行社会主义改造，大家感到眼睛明亮了，有了努力的方向。为了用实际行动来支援国家建设，支援工人同志们的生产，我们农业生产合作社的全体社员已把三万五千多斤余粮全部卖给了国家。我们社员中有百分之八十在过去是吃不饱、穿不暖的穷人。解放后，分了土地，组织了互助组，生活才慢慢好起来；今年成立了合作社，生产和生活就更好了，平均每个劳动力能分到四千多斤粮食。这次开始卖粮的时候，有的人还看不清卖粮对自己对国家有什么好处，有几家过去挨饿挨怕了，现在分到这么多粮真有点舍不得出卖呢。就拿社员扈泉的娘来说吧，起初她明知粮食吃不完也不愿卖，她说：“瞅着粮食在家里多放心。”学习总路线以后，她想到用机器种地才真正好，今年我们生产合作社用拖拉机站和捷克斯洛伐克送的拖拉机耕地才打了这么多粮食。她想通了这些道理，就高高兴兴地把三百多斤余粮全部卖给国家，支援国家的工业建设。在我们社员的带动和影响下，全乡现在已经卖了八万多斤余粮给国家。
    农业生产合作社是今年春天在党和政府的领导帮助下成立起来的。全社一共有三十多个劳动力，七百多亩地，有捷克斯洛伐克送的一台拖拉机和一台抽水机，还有政府奖的和自己买的播种机、新式耘锄、马拉犁、玉米脱粒机、花生剥壳机等。我们除开自己有一部分机器外，还和北京郊区拖拉机站订了代耕合同。我们耕作已经是半机械化了，耕地、播种已经全部用机器，中耕也有一部分用机器，只有收割大部分还要用人力。由于采用机器耕的结果，我们社由劳动力不够变成了劳动力剩余，用了一百二十工去积肥和搞副业生产，使全社增加了三千五百多万元的副业收入，和增加了许多肥料；今年谷子和玉米虽然受到水涝和风灾，产量不高，可是每亩平均产量还比村里一般人家多收几十斤，一百三十亩花生，因为拌了根瘤菌，平均每亩收了二百九十四斤，比社外全村平均每亩多收九十六斤。工人同志们，这些是我们过去作梦也想不到的。如果没有国家的工业化，没有你们努力制造机器，没有农业生产合作社，这些是我们怎么也作不到的。
    华北农业机械总厂的工人同志们，我们社里有你们制造的两架最新式的三头耘锄。用它耪地干净，伤不了根，还能培土，一个牲口两个人，一天能耪二十亩。我们锄二遍谷地时，二百多亩地，省了一百个工，还抢了天时。这种耘锄是我们最喜爱的一种农具。这里我们特别把这种情况告诉你们，并向你们致谢。
    这次学习总路线后，我们全体社员都认识到：只有国家工业发展了，农民才能得到新式农具和价钱便宜的工业品。我们除了把全部余粮卖给国家外，还打算拿余钱，购买“一九五四年国家经济建设公债”，好让国家多建一些工厂，多生产电力和机器。我们全体社员向你们保证：带动全乡农民走互助合作的道路，努力增产粮食，支援工业建设。我们对你们的要求是多造新农具，帮助我们发展生产。我们共同努力争取早日走到社会主义！

                  农业生产合作社全体社员
