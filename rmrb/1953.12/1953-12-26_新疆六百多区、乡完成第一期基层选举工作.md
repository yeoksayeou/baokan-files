    More Than Six Hundred Districts and Townships in Xinjiang Complete the First Phase of Grassroots Elections
    By the end of November, over six hundred and fifty districts and townships in Xinjiang Province had successively completed the first phase of grassroots election work. These areas include urban districts, agricultural townships, semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral townships, and pastoral townships. During the elections, people's representative conferences, people's representative meetings, or friendship meetings were held at the district and township levels.

    Many districts and townships in Xinjiang Province that completed the first phase of grassroots elections are areas with mixed ethnic populations. During the elections, voters from all ethnic groups strengthened ethnic unity and elected representatives and grassroots government cadres who were jointly supported by all ethnic groups. These representatives were produced according to the proportion of each ethnic group's population, and ethnic groups with small populations were taken care of. Sula Palace Township in Yining County is an agricultural township with a mix of nine ethnic groups. On average, one representative was elected for every seventy-four people. According to the population ratio, the Uyghur ethnic group produced seventeen representatives, the Manchu ethnic group produced three representatives, the Kazakh ethnic group produced one representative, and the Han, Mongolian, and Russian ethnic groups, whose populations were less than seventy-four, each produced one representative. The Xibe ethnic group, with a population of only seven, also produced one representative.

    Voters of all ethnic groups who participated in the first phase of grassroots elections cherished their democratic rights. Kazakh voters from three pastoral townships in Mulei River County eagerly participated in the elections, crossing grasslands and hills. The number of voters attending the meetings averaged 96% of all voters in the three townships, and some electoral districts reached 100%. In the townships of Shache County where grassroots elections were held, the number of voters attending the meetings reached 99% of all voters. People of all ethnic groups deeply loved the representatives they elected. After the third electoral district of Jiayi Township in Yutian County, at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains, elected its people's representatives, the meeting place immediately celebrated with drums and trumpets. Su Tanhan, a fifty-year-old Uyghur woman, danced and presented portraits of Chairman Mao to the representatives, instructing them to "act according to Chairman Mao's instructions."

    At the people's representative conferences and other forms of meetings held in various grassroots electoral units, the central topic was the development of agricultural and pastoral production in the respective districts. Tailaer Township in Shanshan County decided to renovate all sixteen "Karez wells" in the township, with ten of the "Karez wells" to be extended by 1,080 zhang (approximately 3600 meters). The Second Township of the Third District of Kuqa County resolved to mobilize the masses to collect manure and accumulate fertilizer, striving to increase fertilizer application per mu (approximately 0.067 hectares) by more than 20% in 1954 compared to this year. Currently, grassroots cadres of all ethnic groups who have been educated through the general election are leading the masses more actively and happily than before in carrying out winter production and organizing the delivery of public grain and other tasks.

    新疆六百多区、乡完成第一期基层选举工作
    新疆省有六百五十多个区、乡到十一月底已先后完成了第一期基层选举工作。这些地区包括城市区、农业乡、半农半牧乡和牧业乡。在选举中，都分别召开了区、乡的人民代表大会、人民代表会议或联谊会。
    新疆省完成第一期基层选举的许多区、乡是民族杂居地区，在选举中，各族选民加强了民族团结，选出了为各族人民共同拥护的代表和基层政权干部。这些代表是按照各民族人口比例产生的，并照顾到人口少的民族。伊宁县苏拉宫乡是九个民族杂居的农业乡，平均七十四人选一个代表，按人口比例，维吾尔族产生十七个代表，满族产生三个代表，哈萨克族产生一个代表，人口不足七十四人的汉族、蒙族，俄罗斯族各产生一个代表，人口少到只七人的锡伯族也产生了一个代表。
    参加第一期基层选举的各族选民都异常珍视自己的民主权利。木垒河县三个牧业乡的哈萨克族选民，穿过草原、山岗踊跃参加选举，到会选民人数平均占三个乡全体选民的百分之九十六，部分选区达到了百分之百。莎车县进行基层选举的各乡，到会选民达到了全体选民的百分之九十九。各族人民对自己选出的代表非常热爱。昆仑山下的于阗县加依乡第三选区选出人民代表后，会场上顿时打起皮鼓吹起喇叭来庆贺。五十多岁的维吾尔族妇女苏探汉跳着舞，向代表们献毛主席像，并嘱咐他们“要按毛主席的指示办事”。
    在各基层选举单位召开的人民代表大会和其他形式的会议上，都以开展本区的农、牧业生产作为中心议题。鄯善县泰尔乡决定整修全乡十六道“坎儿井”，其中十道“坎儿井”要延长一千零八十丈。库车县第三区第二乡决议发动群众拾粪积肥，争取一九五四年每亩地施肥比今年增加百分之二十以上。现在，经过普选教育的各族基层干部，都比以前更积极更愉快地领导群众开展冬季生产和组织送公粮等工作。
