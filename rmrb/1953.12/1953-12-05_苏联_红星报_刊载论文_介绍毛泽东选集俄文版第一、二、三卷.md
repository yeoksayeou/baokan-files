    Soviet "Red Star" Publishes Article
    Introducing Russian Editions of Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung, Volumes One, Two, and Three
    The Soviet "Red Star" published on the 1st an article by Colonel A. Martynov entitled "The Glorious Path of the Chinese People's Liberation Struggle," introducing the Russian editions of "Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung," Volumes One, Two, and Three. The article systematically narrated the historical background of the works in Volumes One, Two, and Three of the Russian edition of "Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung," and the history of the Chinese people's liberation struggle under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The article introduced the main works of Comrade Mao Tse-tung during these periods. The article stated: Mao Tse-tung creatively developed Leninist thought. In "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party" and "On New Democracy," he pointed out that the victory of the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution under the leadership of the proletariat would inevitably lead to the establishment of a people's democratic system, a joint dictatorship of all anti-imperialist and anti-feudal forces under the leadership of the proletariat. Under this system, universal democratic measures would be implemented as a necessary condition for China's transition to the next stage of the revolution—the socialist revolution. The consolidation and development of the people's democratic state, its alliance and friendship with the Soviet Union, and the assistance received from the Soviet Union, made it possible for the new democratic China to avoid developing towards capitalism and instead follow the path of socialism. The article stated: Now, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the great Chinese people are victoriously realizing the task of consolidating and developing the people's democratic state, and are unswervingly struggling, together with all peace-loving people, to consolidate the cause of world peace. The People's Republic of China is a powerful stabilizing factor in the Asian and Pacific region. The article stated: Mao Tse-tung's theoretical summarization of the experience of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle, and his creative research on many issues related to the national liberation movement, are a huge contribution to the ideological treasure trove of the international revolutionary movement, and he has enriched the theory of Marxism-Leninism. The article concluded: The cadres of the Soviet Communist Party and the government, as well as the cadres of the Soviet army, will have great interest in Mao Tse-tung's works. They will find in these works many things that are beneficial and necessary to them. (Xinhua News Agency)
