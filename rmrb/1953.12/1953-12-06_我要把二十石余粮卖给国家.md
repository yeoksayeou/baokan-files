    I want to sell twenty *shi* of surplus grain to the state
    Spoken by Ha Yuliang
    My name is Ha Yuliang, and I am a farmer from Tukou Village, Fourth District, Qingyuan County, Liaodong Province. This year, my crops had a bumper harvest. After paying the agricultural tax and setting aside enough to eat, I still have a surplus of twenty *shi* of grain. When I was harvesting, I thought, "Grain is precious when it's scarce," so I planned to sell it during the lean season to make more money. Before the harvest was even brought home, I was already complaining, "The harvest is a disaster! After paying the agricultural tax, there won't even be enough to eat." I did this to deceive everyone and take advantage of the situation to sell for a higher price. When the harvest was brought home, the supply and marketing cooperative wanted to sign a grain pre-purchase contract with me, but my first words were, "I don't have any, how could I have any grain!" At that time, I did not sell the grain to the supply and marketing cooperative.
    A few days ago, the district committee secretary and some comrades explained to us the benefits of selling grain to the state and the reasons for taking the socialist road to a happy life. This really opened my eyes.
    That night, I tossed and turned in bed, unable to sleep. The words of the district committee secretary kept swirling in my head. Before liberation, I was a poor boy who suffered beatings and scolding from the Japanese devils and exploitation from the landlords. After working hard for a whole year, I still lacked food and clothing, and all three of us brothers were too poor to get married. Since the Communist Party came, we were given houses and land, and with the government's support, we have harvested more and more grain each year, more than we can eat or wear. In the past three years, my family has taken two wives and acquired livestock and farm implements. Our life is truly as red as the morning sun. If it weren't for the leadership of the Communist Party, how could I live such a prosperous life!
    At the same time, I thought about the great contributions and support that the working-class brothers have made to the country and to the farmers. In recent years, the country's industry has developed, and the prices of industrial products have become cheaper year by year, while the prices of agricultural products have increased year by year. In 1951, selling one hundred *jin* of soybeans could buy fifty-eight and five-eighths *jin* of salt or six *jin* of kerosene. This year, selling one hundred *jin* of soybeans can buy seventy-eight and five-eighths *jin* of salt or eighteen *jin* of kerosene. The development of the country's industry is a great benefit to us farmers! If we sell grain to the state to support national construction, the country's industry will develop, and our lives will become even more prosperous, won't they? If we sell grain to speculators, they will use it for speculation, buying it for one price and selling it for two or three. If grain prices rise, commodity prices will also rise, which is not good for the country or for ourselves! Thinking about this, I felt even more that I couldn't keep the grain to sell to speculators. I must sell the twenty *shi* of surplus grain to the state.
    I thought about how, when the country's industry develops, farmers will use machines to farm in the future. I was so happy! A tractor can plow one hundred and eighty *mu* of land in a day and a night, and plow it deep. The machine goes forward with a "ka, ka" sound, and people sit on the machine. How wonderful is that! Thinking about this, I got energized! In the past, I worked individually, but this year I must join a mutual aid team and grow more grain to sell to the state. When the country's industry develops, it will be able to manufacture large quantities of new farm tools and tractors for the farmers. Following the development of the country's industry, we will move step by step towards socialism and live the same happy life as the Soviet farmers. (Recorded by Zhong Guoan)

### 我要把二十石余粮卖给国家

    我要把二十石余粮卖给国家
    哈玉良  说
    我叫哈玉良，是辽东省清原县第四区土口村的农民。今年我的庄稼丰收了，除了公粮和吃的，还能剩余二十石粮。在割庄稼的时候，我就想：“粮缺为贵”，等青黄不接的时候卖，多卖两个钱。庄稼还没拉来家，我就吵吵：“庄稼瞎啦，去了公粮连吃的也不够。”我这样做，是想挡过大家的眼睛，趁空子多卖钱。庄稼拉来家时，供销合作社要和我订预购粮食合同，我头一句话就说：“没有，我哪有粮！”当时我没有把粮食卖给供销合作社。
    前几天，区委书记和一些同志，给我们讲了把粮食卖给国家的好处和走社会主义道路过幸福生活的道理，这就给我开了眼界。
    那天夜里，我躺在炕上翻来覆去地睡不着觉。区委书记说的话，在我脑子里直转。在解放前，我是一个穷小子，受日本鬼子的打骂，受地主的剥削，一年干到头，还缺吃少穿，哥三个都穷得娶不上媳妇。自从共产党来了，我们分到了房子和土地，在政府扶助下，打的粮食一年比一年多，吃不了穿不了。三年来，家里娶了两房媳妇，又置上了牲口和农具，小日子真像早晨的太阳一样红起来了。这要不是共产党的领导，我怎能过这样富裕的生活！
    同时，我想到工人老大哥对国家的贡献，对农民的支援实在是很大的。这几年，国家工业发展了，工业品价格一年比一年便宜，农产品的价格却一年比一年提高。一九五一年，卖一百斤大豆能买五十八斤五两粒盐，或者买六斤火油；今年卖一百斤大豆就能买七十八斤五两粒盐，或者十八斤火油。国家工业发展了，对咱农民的好处太大啦！要是把粮食卖给国家，支援国家建设，国家工业发展了，咱们的生活不就更富裕吗？若是把粮食卖给投机商人，他们拿去做投机买卖，一个钱买，两、三个钱卖，粮食涨价，物价也跟着涨，这对国家、对自己都没有好处啊！想到这里，我越发感到不能把粮食留着卖给投机商人，一定要把二十石余粮卖给国家。
    我想到国家工业发展了，将来农民使用机器种地，真高兴极啦！一台拖拉机一天一宿能翻一百八十亩地，翻的还深。机器“卡”“卡”地往前走，人坐在机器上，这多么好啊！想到这，我就来劲啦！我过去是单干，今年一定要参加互助组，多打粮食卖给国家。国家工业发展了，好制造大批新农具和拖拉机给农民。我们跟着国家工业的发展，就一步一步地走到社会主义，和苏联农民过一样的幸福生活。  （钟国安记）
