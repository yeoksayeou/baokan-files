    To guarantee the people's food supply and combat speculative merchants, the Party and the government are mobilizing farmers to sell their surplus grain to the state. To strive for a bumper harvest next year in agriculture, so as to ensure the smooth progress of national construction and the gradual improvement of people's living standards, it is also necessary to make preparations for developing mutual aid and cooperation and other means of expanding agricultural production next year. These two tasks in rural work are both very important and completely consistent. Only by doing both tasks well at the same time can the mission be considered complete. If only grain is procured, but farmers do not increase production next year, then no matter how much grain is bought, it cannot be considered a successful completion of the task, but rather a serious failure. As everyone knows, procuring grain is to meet the consumption needs of urban and rural people; and with the expansion of industrial cities and areas growing cash crops, this need will inevitably increase every year. Therefore, grain and other agricultural products must be continuously increased to meet the needs of procurement every year in the future, and also to enable the broad masses of farmers to improve their lives every year. Therefore, in the process of procuring grain from farmers, this work must be closely linked to the requirement of increasing production; after procuring grain, we must immediately concentrate our efforts to lead and help farmers to continue expanding production, and mobilize farmers to invest the money earned from selling grain in production as much as possible in a planned way.
    Mobilizing farmers to sell grain to the state should never, and must never be allowed to, hinder the production enthusiasm of farmers, but should only and must only enhance the production enthusiasm of farmers. That is to say, we must ensure that the work of grain procurement is done well, ensure that farmers fully understand the needs and policies of the state, understand the consistency of the interests of farmers and the interests of the state, and respond to the call of the Party and the government enthusiastically rather than reluctantly. We should achieve this, and we are fully capable of achieving this, because: For surplus grain households, the grain the state procures from them is originally grain that they cannot finish eating themselves and will sell sooner or later; the price the state procures grain at is also reasonable and does not cause farmers to suffer losses; the state will also continuously supply farmers with the necessary means of production and means of livelihood at reasonable prices at the same time as and after procuring grain; in this way, farmers who have sold grain can wholeheartedly arrange production and expand production. For grain-deficient households, the state can guarantee that they have grain to eat after procuring grain; the price at which the state supplies them with grain is also as reasonable as the procurement price, and the state does not earn any money in the process; they can also no longer be exploited by usurers and unscrupulous merchants, and can no longer worry about grain shortages; in this way, they can also concentrate on production, and their enthusiasm for production will also increase. For farmers in areas that produce industrial raw material crops such as cotton and hemp, the state can also make overall plans after procuring grain to ensure that farmers in these areas have enough grain to eat; they can also benefit from stable grain prices, so that they do not have to buy grain at high prices because they do not produce grain themselves, and they do not have to spend a lot of labor to buy grain from afar. For some farmers who hoard grain and want to speculate, the state's procurement of grain can save them from the dangerous road of capitalism and turn them to the bright path of mutual aid and cooperation to increase production; by blocking the road to speculation, the legitimate production enthusiasm of these people will also increase again. As for members of mutual aid and cooperative organizations, especially members of agricultural producers' cooperatives, their political awareness is generally higher, and they basically recognize that they are taking a path where everyone can become rich and they themselves can become rich; their output of agricultural products has increased, their income has increased, their personal interests and national interests have become more closely linked, and therefore, in general, members of agricultural producers' cooperatives are particularly supportive of the state's grain procurement policy, and grain procurement will not hinder their production enthusiasm. A small number of people within mutual aid groups were previously tempted by external grain speculators and were somewhat shaken; now, they can also settle down and take the road of mutual aid and cooperation and common prosperity, and their enthusiasm for production has also increased.
    Now, the facts in many places have proven that as long as we steadily grasp the policies in grain procurement and do a good job of propaganda and education, the production enthusiasm of farmers will not only not decrease, but will also become even higher. The farmers in Nanli and Shangguan townships in Qin County, Shanxi Province, originally had a general reluctance to sell grain. The Party branches in each township organized Party members and mass activists into a strong propaganda force, and widely and deeply publicized the future of social development, the benefits and role of state grain procurement, price policies, etc. among the masses. At the same time, they mobilized the masses to sell their surplus grain to the state, turning "dead treasures" into "living treasures," expanding investment, and increasing agricultural production. After doing this, many mutual aid groups and individual farmers planned to buy livestock, carts, bean cakes, red alum (for insect control), and some daily necessities. Each township quickly sold more than 10,000 to 20,000 catties of grain to the state. When drawing up production plans, many mutual aid group farmers saw that agricultural producers' cooperatives were "more capable, sold more grain, bought more things, and will definitely increase production more next year," so they prepared to join cooperatives or set up cooperatives next year. In Shanggao Township, Tai'an, Shandong, the Hao Peiying mutual aid group, with the help of the township work team, summarized and evaluated the year's production, and carried out education on the general line of the state's transition period. The group members understood that in order to further increase production, they must sell their surplus grain to the state and expand production investment. Therefore, each household made plans and sold a total of 5,600 catties of grain; they also actively prepared to buy fertilizers, new-style walking plows, and pesticides. Their production enthusiasm was high, and they actively created conditions to strive for the establishment of an agricultural producers' cooperative. In Zhang Guozhuang Township, Fengtai District, Beijing, after publicizing the general line and grain procurement policies, they explained and dispelled the masses' ideological concerns, and quickly completed the grain procurement task. It was originally estimated that only 30,000 catties could be procured, but in fact, more than 40,000 catties were procured, and the masses immediately deposited nearly half of the grain money into the bank. The peasant masses, especially members of agricultural producers' cooperatives, support the grain procurement policy, so it naturally does not hinder the production enthusiasm of the masses. The Huang Jialiu mutual aid group in Jiujiang County, Jiangxi Province, promptly bought back seeds after selling grain, and the planting area of various winter crops increased by 50% to 200% compared to last year. After the members of the Xu Shangwen mutual aid group in Wenjiang County, Sichuan Province, understood the reason for selling grain to the state, they have sold more than 10,000 catties of rice to the state. Their entire group calculated an account: last year, they sold grain to the cooperative, and this year they bought back 2.05 million yuan worth of fertilizer, adding it to 86 mu of autumn fields. The increased rice production alone was worth more than 3.794 million yuan compared to last year. Therefore, their enthusiasm for investing in expanding production is even higher. Wang Laofu, a farmer in Dongtian Village, Lingui County, Guangxi Province, had a bumper harvest this year. He and his wife originally planned to store the surplus grain at home; they had suffered from hunger in the past, and now they felt happy every day when they looked at the grain stored at home. Later, after education by the cadres, they realized that they should sell the grain to the state, so they sold the grain to the state's grain company and used the money to buy a yellow ox. When they looked at the ox, they felt even happier than when they saw the grain stored at home.
    From these examples, we can see what the relationship between grain procurement and the production enthusiasm of farmers really is. – Farmers have high production enthusiasm, are keen to invest in expanding production and are unwilling to hoard and speculate, so they are willing to sell their surplus grain to the state; after being educated and selling their surplus grain, they are clear about the future of agricultural development, and their production enthusiasm is even higher. This is the same in both old and new areas, and in agricultural producers' cooperatives, mutual aid groups, or individual farmers, only the degree is different. In the Soviet Union, in the spring of 1928, not long after the start of the first five-year plan, a large-scale grain procurement effort was also carried out. Facts have proven that this did not hinder the production enthusiasm of farmers. In July of that year, Stalin pointed out that in this grain procurement, the cultivated area in various regions expanded; in the main grain-producing areas, farmers expanded their cultivated area by 2% to 15% or 20%, and the collectivization movement in agriculture followed with an unprecedentedly rapid leap forward. All this shows that the majority of farmers can believe that all the interests of the state led by the working class on the basis of the worker-peasant alliance are consistent with the interests of the farmers. If we do not believe this, we will fall behind the masses; if we do not guide them according to the situation, we will miss the possibility of the farmers taking a big step forward.
    Many comrades working in rural areas have established deep friendships with farmers in the past revolutionary struggles, and are always thinking of the masses and are always afraid that the masses will suffer losses, which is very good. However, to think of the masses, we must first see clearly the path of the masses' progress, think of the masses for the long term, and think of the majority of the masses, and clearly distinguish the temporary demands of a few people from the long-term interests of the majority. Some people say: "Farmers have contributed to the revolution; today they have grain and can make a little fortune, and the state comes to procure their surplus grain at a fixed price, isn't this crossing the river and tearing down the bridge?" Saying this means not seeing the future clearly and not distinguishing between right and wrong. The Party and the People's Government will never forget the farmers' contribution to the revolution; farmers will continue to make contributions to national construction in the future; the government and the working class have always been enthusiastic in helping farmers in the past, and will continue to be so and will always be so in the future. Procuring the surplus grain of farmers at a fixed price, fairly and accurately guaranteeing the interests of surplus grain households and the needs of grain-deficient households, not allowing surplus grain households to become speculative merchants, and not allowing grain-deficient households to suffer hunger and debt, is precisely the most important help for farmers. It should be known that if we allow capitalist forces to run rampant in rural areas, and watch a small number of surplus grain households become speculative merchants, and grain-deficient households and farmers in disaster areas suffer hunger and debt, and remain indifferent, this is a downright "crossing the river and tearing down the bridge": tearing down the bridge that politically guarantees the farmers' continued unity and progress, and also tearing down the bridge that economically guarantees the farmers' common prosperity and happiness, in short, tearing down the bridge to transition to socialism, and letting the farmers drown in the capitalist river! The Party and the government will certainly never commit this absurd mistake. In fact, the Party and the government are caring for the farmers with greater strength than ever before, and the broad masses of working farmers will surely firmly support the policies of the Party and the government, and their enthusiasm for production will surely become higher and higher year by year. The key lies in how the comrades working in rural areas actively and correctly guide the farmers, so that they can exert their greatest enthusiasm.
    How to guide the production enthusiasm of the masses into practical actions to strive for increased production?
    In order to develop agricultural production, it is necessary to actively lead farmers to steadily develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement. After vigorously publicizing the general line and carrying out grain procurement work, the enthusiasm of the masses for mutual aid and cooperation, especially the enthusiasm for running agricultural producers' cooperatives, will be greatly increased. The comrades working in rural areas, especially the leading comrades in various counties, must cherish this enthusiasm of the masses, better lead them, and correctly carry out education, so that the enthusiasm of the masses does not cool down, and the masses do not suffer setbacks in their progress due to lack of experience. We must earnestly provide assistance in establishing institutions, organizing labor, improving technology, and increasing equipment.
    The most important thing is to actively guide farmers to correctly dispose of the large amount of cash they receive from selling grain, and to do our utmost to ensure that they do not waste this fund, but mainly use it to expand production. Any part of it that is not used up for the time being should be deposited in the bank or cooperative, so that it can be used in bulk later, and at the same time, interest can be earned, and currency will not be crowded in the market, causing price increases that are detrimental to farmers. At the same time, we must do a good job in various preparations for next year's production. Therefore, we must use all means to meet the farmers' requirements for preparing fertilizers, adding agricultural tools and livestock, protecting livestock safely through the winter (mainly solving the problems of feed and winter epidemics), building small-scale water conservancy projects, carrying out winter plowing to preserve moisture, preventing frost damage to wheat, and developing sideline production that is conducive to agriculture. That is to say, we must do a good job in both material supply and technical promotion.
    In grain procurement work, starting with publicizing the general line and mobilizing to expand production, and then returning to increasing production and implementing the general line, some places (such as Qin County in Shanxi and Tai'an in Shandong) have created very good experiences. Some places have created good results by convening meetings of the elderly, women's meetings, and meetings of demobilized soldiers to mobilize grain sales and increase production. All localities should pay attention to promoting these experiences, do a good job in grain procurement work, and naturally connect the work of further developing mutual aid and cooperation, expanding production investment, and grain procurement work. Rural Party members, League members, labor models, and other activists should use their own exemplary actions to lead all farmers to invest in preparations for large-scale production with greater enthusiasm, and strive for higher agricultural output next year than this year, and a better life for farmers than this year!

### 既要做好粮食收购工作又要达到农业增产的目的

    既要做好粮食收购工作又要达到农业增产的目的
    为了保证人民的粮食供应，打击投机商人，党和政府正在动员农民把余粮卖给国家。为了争取明年农业的丰收，以保证国家建设的顺利进行和人民生活水平的逐步提高，还必须做好发展互助合作和其他扩大明年农业生产的准备工作。农村工作中的这两项任务都是十分重要的，也是完全一致的。只有把两项工作同时都做好了，才能算是完成了任务。如果只收购了粮食，农民在明年却没有增加生产，那么就是粮食买的再多，不但不能算是完成任务，而且是一种严重的失败。大家知道，收购粮食是为了满足城乡人民消费的需要；而随着工业城市和种植技术作物区域的扩大，这种需要势必每年有所增加；因此，粮食和其他农产品必须不断增加，才能满足今后每年收购的需要，也才能使广大的农民生活每年有所改善。因此，在向农民收购粮食的过程中，就必须把这一工作和增加生产的要求紧紧地连系起来；在收购了粮食以后，就要立即集中力量领导和帮助农民继续扩大生产，动员农民把卖粮所得的钱尽量有计划地投入生产。
    动员农民把粮食卖给国家，决不应该也决不许可妨碍农民的生产积极性，而只应该也只许可提高农民的生产积极性。这就是说，必须保证把购粮的工作做好，保证农民完全了解国家的需要和政策，了解农民的利益和国家的利益的一致性，热烈地而不是勉强地响应党和政府的号召。我们应该做到这一点，也完全能够做到这一点，这是因为：对于余粮户来说，国家向他们收购的粮食，本来就是他们自己吃不完，迟早要卖的；国家收购粮食的价格也是合理的，并不要农民吃亏；国家在收购粮食的同时和收购粮食以后，还要以合理的价格陆续把农民必需的生产资料和生活资料供给农民；这样，卖了粮食的农民就可以一心一意地安排生产、扩大生产。对于缺粮户来说，国家收购了粮食以后，就可以保证他们有粮食吃；国家供应他们的粮食价格也是和收购价格同样合理的，国家并不要在这中间赚什么钱；他们还可以不再受高利贷者和奸商的剥削，可以不再为缺粮而发愁；这样，他们也就能安心生产了，生产积极性也就会高涨起来。对于生产棉麻等工业原料作物的地区的农民来说，国家收购了粮食以后，也可以通盘打算，保证这些地方的农民有够吃的粮食；他们也能得到粮价平稳的好处，不致于因为自己不生产粮食而出高价买粮食吃，也不必再费很多工到远处去买粮食。对于一部分囤积粮食想要投机的农民来说，国家收购了粮食，就可以把他们从资本主义的危险的路上挽救出来，转到互助合作增加生产的光明大道上；把投机的路堵住了，这些人的正当的生产积极性也会重新增长起来。至于互助合作组织的成员，特别是农业生产合作社的社员，他们的政治觉悟一般地说是较高的，他们基本上已经认识了自己是在走着一条大家都能富裕自己也能富裕的道路，他们的农产品产量提高了，他们的收入增加了，他们的个人利益和国家利益已经结合得更紧了，因此，一般地说，农业生产合作社的社员们对于国家购粮政策是特别拥护的，购粮更不会妨碍他们的生产积极性。互助组内部少数人过去受外部的粮食投机者的诱惑，有些动摇；现在，他们也能稳下心来走互助合作、共同富裕的大路了，生产积极性也就提高了。
    现在，许多地方的事实已经证明：只要在购粮中稳稳地掌握政策，并且把宣传教育工作做好，农民的生产积极性不但不会降低，并且会更加高涨起来。山西沁县南里、上官等乡农民本来对于粮食普遍有惜售思想，各乡党的支部把党员和群众积极分子组成了强大的宣传力量，在群众中广泛深入地宣传了社会发展的前途，国家收购粮食的好处和作用，价格政策等等，同时动员群众把余粮卖给国家，把“死宝”变为“活宝”，扩大投资，增加农业生产。这样做了以后，许多互助组和单干农民都打算买牲口、大车、豆饼、红矾（杀虫用）和一些日用品。每个乡很快就卖给国家一万多斤到两万多斤粮食。在打生产谱的时候，许多互助组的农民看到农业生产合作社“本事大，卖粮多，买东西多，明年增产也一定多”，就准备明年入社或办社。山东泰安上高乡郝培英互助组在驻乡工作组的帮助下，对全年生产作了总结、评比，进行了国家过渡时期总路线的教育，组员们明白了：为了进一步增加生产，就必须把余粮卖给国家，扩大生产投资。于是，户户打谱，总共卖粮五千六百斤；还积极地准备买肥料、新式步犁和农药，生产情绪高涨，积极创造条件争取成立农业生产合作社。北京市丰台区张郭庄乡宣传了总路线和购粮政策以后，针对群众思想顾虑作了解释，很快就完成了购粮任务；原来估计只能收购三万斤，实际上共收购了四万多斤，而且群众马上把近半数的粮款都存入了银行。农民群众，特别是农业生产合作社社员，对购粮政策是拥护的，这样就自然妨碍不了群众的生产积极性。江西省九江县黄家柳互助组卖粮后及时买回了种籽，各种冬季作物种植面积比去年扩大了百分之五十到二百。四川省温江县徐尚文互助组组员们懂得了把粮食卖给国家的道理以后，已卖给国家一万多斤大米。他们全组算了一个账：去年向合作社卖了粮，今年买回二百零五万元的肥料，追加在八十六亩秋田里，仅仅比去年增产的大米就值三百七十九万四千多元。因此，他们投资扩大生产的兴头更高了。广西临桂县东田村农民王老福今年得到了丰收，他和妻子原来打算把余粮存在家里；他们过去受饥挨饿，现在天天看一眼存在家里的粮食心里就觉得痛快。后来经过干部进行教育，他们想通了应当把粮食卖给国家的道理，就把粮食卖给国家的粮食公司，拿钱买了一条黄犍牛。当他们看着牛的时候，比看见家里放的粮食的时候心里更痛快了。
    从这些例子里，我们可以看出来，购粮和农民的生产积极性的关系究竟是怎样的。——农民生产积极性高涨，热心投资扩大生产而不愿意囤积投机，就乐意把余粮卖给国家了；受了教育、卖了余粮以后，对农业发展的前途心中有数，生产积极性就更加高涨了。不论老区、新区，不论农业生产合作社、互助组或者单干农民，在这一点上都是相同的，只是程度各有不同罢了。在苏联，一九二八年春天，第一个五年计划开始不久的时候，也曾进行过一次大规模的购粮工作。事实证明，这对于农民的生产积极性并没有妨碍。那年七月，斯大林指出，在这次收购粮食中，各区的耕地面积扩大了起来；在生产粮食的主要地区，农民把耕地扩大了百分之二到百分之十五或二十，并且农业集体化运动随之有了空前迅速的跃进。这一切说明了，大多数农民能够相信：工人领导的以工农联盟为基础的国家的一切利益都是和农民的利益一致的。如果我们不相信这一点，就落后于群众了；如果我们不因势利导，就会把农民大大前进一步的可能性贻误了。
    许多在农村工作的同志在过去的革命斗争中和农民建立了深厚的友情，时时为群众打算，处处怕群众吃亏，这是很好的。但是，要为群众打算，就先要把群众前进的道路看清楚，为群众打算得长远一些，并且要为大多数群众作打算，把少数人的一时的要求和大多数人的长远的利益分别清楚。有人说：“农民对革命是有功劳的；今天他们有了粮食，能发一点财了，国家又来按一定的价格收购他们的余粮，这不是过河拆桥吗？”这样说，正是没有看清前途，没有分清是非。农民对革命的功劳，党和人民政府永远不会忘记；今后农民在国家建设中也还要继续立功劳；政府和工人阶级过去一直是热心帮助农民的，现在仍然、今后也永远会是这样的。用一定的价格收购农民的余粮，公平地确切地保障余粮户的利益和缺粮户的需要，不让余粮户变为投机商人，也不让缺粮户挨饿负债，这正是对于农民的真正最重要的帮助。要知道，如果放任农村中资本主义势力自由泛滥，看着少数余粮户变为投机商人，缺粮户和灾区农民挨饿欠债，居然不闻不问，这才是不折不扣的“过河拆桥”呢：拆了政治上保证农民继续团结进步的桥，也拆了经济上保证农民一同富裕幸福的桥，总之是拆了过渡到社会主义去的桥，让农民淹死在资本主义的河水里！这种荒唐的错误，党和政府当然是决不能犯的。事实上，党和政府正在用着比以往任何时候都更大的力量来关心着农民，而广大的劳动农民也一定会坚决地拥护党和政府的政策，他们的生产积极性也一定会一年比一年更加高涨。关键就在于在农村工作的同志们怎样积极地正确地引导农民，使他们发挥最大的积极性。
    怎样把群众的生产积极性引导到争取增产的实际行动中去呢？
    为了发展农业生产，就要积极地领导农民稳步地开展互助合作运动。在大张旗鼓地宣传了总路线、进行了购粮工作以后，群众互助合作的积极性，特别是办农业生产合作社的热情，会大大地高涨起来。在农村工作的同志们，特别是各县的领导同志们，一定要爱护群众的这种热情，要更好地加以领导，要正确地进行教育，既不要使群众的热情冷下去，也不要使群众因为缺乏经验而在前进中受到挫折。要在建立机构、组织劳动力、改进技术、增加设备等方面都切实地给以帮助。
    最重要的一件事就是要积极指导农民正确地支配卖粮所得的大量现金，要竭力保证他们不浪费这笔资金，而把它主要地用到扩大生产方面，一时用不完的存到银行或合作社中去，以便于日后整批使用，同时可以得到利息，也免得把货币都挤在市场上，引起物价上涨对农民不利。同时，要做好明年生产的各项准备工作。因此，要用一切办法满足农民对于准备肥料、添置农具和牲畜、保护牲畜安全过冬
  （主要是解决饲料和冬季疫病问题）、兴修小型水利、进行冬耕保墒、小麦防冻和开展有利于农业的副业生产等方面的要求。这就是说，既要做好物资供应工作，也要做好技术推广工作。
    在购粮工作中，从宣传总路线和动员扩大生产入手，又归结到增加生产和实行总路线，有些地方
  （如山西沁县、山东泰安等地）已经创造了很好的经验。有些地方创造了召开老人会、妇女会、退伍军人会等办法动员售粮增产，也有很好的效果。各地应当注意推广这些经验，把购粮工作做好，使进
  一步发展互助合作扩大生产投资的工作和购粮工作自然地衔接起来。农村党员、团员、劳动模范和其他积极分子，要以自己的模范行动，带动全体农民，以更高的积极性投入大生产的准备，争取明年农业产量比今年更高，农民生活比今年更好！
