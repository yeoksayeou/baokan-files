    Sum Up the Industrial Construction Experience of 1953 and Greet New Victories

    The year 1953 is about to pass. This year, we have achieved many successes on the industrial front. Several huge new factories, mines, and power stations have been established or begun to be established; the products produced by the old factories and mines are more than in any previous year; new railways are also extending daily in the northwest and southwest regions. Leaders at all levels of industrial departments and all employees have overcome many difficulties and learned some new knowledge and technologies. We have successfully completed the construction of the first year of the first five-year plan at the expected speed.

    But for us, industrial construction is still a new course. What we have learned in the past three years of the recovery period and this year is still very incompatible with the requirements of the entire industrialization cause. We must continue to work hard and learn without any slackening. And one of the best and most important learning methods is to learn from practice, from summarizing our own successful and failed experiences. At present, it is necessary to seriously summarize the industrial construction experience of 1953, and through this summary, improve the level of leadership and educate the vast number of cadres. In the past, some of our leading cadres worked very actively and were very busy, but they could not foresee and put forward the direction of efforts and key issues, and correctly guide and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the cadres and the masses below. In the departments or enterprises they lead, some things were done correctly, but they could not summarize experience to consolidate and promote; some things were done wrong, and they could not study lessons to prevent and correct them. Often, things that were done wrong last year are repeated this year; after being corrected on this side, they deviate to the other side; this unit took a detour or hit a snag, and that unit repeated the same mistake; or the problems that this unit has already solved, that unit is still groping for; the successful experiences created or learned by advanced enterprises, advanced workers, and technicians cannot be concentrated, promoted, and turned into everyone's common wealth. These situations show that summarizing experience is not only a general leadership method or learning method for our cadres engaged in industrial construction, but also has more serious practical significance. Next year, the task of industrial construction will be more arduous, the construction projects to be newly built, expanded, and rebuilt will be more than this year, the technical requirements will be more complicated than this year, and the production plans and various economic and technical indicators will also be higher than this year. If we do not summarize this year's experience well, do not consolidate and promote the skills we have learned, do not improve backward units, and do not try to avoid repeating this year's mistakes in next year's work, it will be difficult to complete the tasks assigned to us by the state. Therefore, industrial leading departments at all levels and all enterprise units must fully recognize the important significance of summarizing the industrial construction experience of 1953 and earnestly do this work well.

    In the summary work, the leading cadres of industrial departments and enterprise units at all levels should first examine their own leading ideology. In 1953, we vigorously opposed certain tendencies of blind advancement in capital construction, which played a major role in implementing the state's policy of focusing on key construction projects. However, what is the root cause of this tendency, how can we effectively prevent this kind of thinking in future work, and how can we prevent and overcome the conservative tendency of shrinking back when opposing and correcting the tendency of blind advancement? In terms of production, at the beginning of this year, we opposed certain conservative tendencies, and the plans of many departments and enterprises were made relatively advanced. However, the results of this year's practice have also proved that the production plans of some departments are still conservative, and individual departments have even overfulfilled the annual plan without much effort. At the same time, when formulating the 1954 production plan, in some departments and enterprises, on the one hand, the state's planned targets were not reached, and on the other hand, they felt that this planning was not as "tense" as in the spring. What is the root cause of these phenomena? At the beginning of this year, Chairman Mao issued a call to overcome bureaucracy. Since then, all industrial departments have conducted in-depth investigations and studies on the work of their departments and made overall arrangements based on the spirit of Chairman Mao's instructions. Now, how have these arrangements been implemented, what achievements have various departments and enterprises made in improving their leadership style, what shortcomings still exist, and how should they be improved? In addition, in this year's work, all departments and enterprise units have felt that mutual cooperation and collaboration is an extremely important condition for doing a good job in industrial construction, and have taken some measures to strengthen collaboration. How has this aspect of work been done? These issues must be deeply and specifically analyzed and studied, and experience and lessons must be summarized in order to ensure that our industrial construction in 1954 proceeds along the correct track.

    In the summary, leading organs at all levels, especially the leading cadres of factories, mines, and basic construction units, should also sum up the experience in enterprise management and the experience of this year's increase production and practice economy movement. This year, most industrial departments and basic construction units have achieved significant results in implementing planned management and implementing the responsibility system, and in strengthening technical management. Especially after the start of the increase production and practice economy movement, many enterprises have further improved management, paid attention to the combination of supply, production, and sales, and carried out mass labor competitions with technical reform and labor organization reform as the main content, thereby ensuring the completion and overfulfillment of the state's production plan and basic construction plan on schedule. However, the work of improving enterprise management and the development of the increase production and practice economy movement this year are very unbalanced. As far as the whole country is concerned, although everyone has made progress in management, there are not many who have really done well in all aspects, and there are still many factories and mines that have done relatively poorly, or certain aspects have done relatively poorly. In the increase production and practice economy movement, the problems of many accidents and low quality are still relatively common, and the work of promoting advanced experience has not been done well in most departments and regions. These achievements and shortcomings must also be well summarized. Of course, when conducting this summary, each department and unit should choose different focuses according to its own situation and characteristics. For example, the coal mine production department should focus on summarizing how to make the work of geology, tunneling, and mining adapt to each other and advance evenly; the machinery industry department should focus on summarizing how to improve the technical level and establish the idea of serving users, in order to rapidly increase new varieties and gradually solve the fundamental contradiction that on the one hand, the needs of national construction cannot be met, and on the other hand, the production efficiency cannot be fully utilized, and so on.

    In summarizing this year's work, the leading cadres of various departments and enterprises should also organize and help technicians and workers to summarize technical experience. In this year's basic construction and production, the broad masses of workers and technicians have shown a high degree of creativity, and a large number of advanced technical experiences have emerged. Especially in enterprises with direct assistance from Soviet experts, they have begun to learn or have learned some advanced experiences that are decisive for the smooth progress of basic construction and the improvement of production efficiency. If we concentrate these experiences well, sort them out and promote them, we can greatly improve labor productivity and accelerate the process of our industrial construction. Especially next year, we will begin to build many of the most important projects. In these projects, if we do not master the advanced experience and advanced technology of the Soviet Union, not only will it be impossible to talk about improving labor efficiency, but it can simply be said that it will be difficult to move forward. Therefore, when summarizing this year's basic construction experience, we must especially focus on summarizing the experience of key projects.

    Finally, the party organizations in various regions and enterprises must also sum up the experience of carrying out political work in the enterprise. It is necessary to check and summarize how to publicize the party's general line in the transition period to the workers and masses, improve the workers' awareness, overcome some incorrect ideas among the workers, and encourage them to fight with greater enthusiasm and courage for the realization of socialist industrialization. It is necessary to summarize the experience of how to lead the trade union and the Communist Youth League to cooperate with the administration to improve enterprise management and comprehensively and balancedly complete the state plan, and to check whether there is a tendency to abandon political work or to engage in political work divorced from production.

    To do a good job in summarizing the work of 1953, it is also necessary to adopt the correct attitude and method. That is to say, leading cadres at all levels must do it themselves to ensure the quality of the summary and to effectively improve the leadership level through the summary work. It is necessary to conduct in-depth inspection, analysis, and summary with emphasis on the characteristics of the work of the department and the main problems in the actual work this year, in order to find out the reasons for obtaining achievements or causing shortcomings and errors in the main aspects of the work, and to summarize truly beneficial experiences and lessons. It is necessary to carry forward the spirit of criticism and self-criticism and the attitude of seeking truth from facts and in-depth investigation and research, fully absorb the opinions of the masses, and mobilize the masses to participate in the summary. Finally, and most importantly, it is necessary to implement the spirit that the summary is for the purpose of improving the work, and according to the summarized experience and lessons, combined with the work tasks of next year, practically formulate methods for improvement and specific measures plans. For example, leading cadres at all levels should quickly formulate the work guidelines and arrangements for their departments in 1954, so that the employees have a clear direction for struggle at the beginning of the year. In this way, we can say that we have comprehensively completed the task of 1953, and we can greet the new victory in industrial construction in 1954 with full confidence.

### 总结一九五三年工业建设经验，迎接新的胜利

    总结一九五三年工业建设经验，迎接新的胜利
    一九五三年就要过去了。这一年中，我们在工业战线上取得了很多成绩。若干巨大的新型的工厂、矿井和电站已经建立或开始建立起来；旧有的工厂和矿山生产的产品，比以往任何一年都要多；新的铁道在西北和西南地区也正在日益延伸着。工业部门的各级领导干部和全体职工克服了许多困难，学会了一些新的知识和技术。第一个五年计划的头一年的建设，我们已胜利地按照预定的速度完成了。
    但是对我们说来，工业建设毕竟还是一门新的课程。我们在过去三年的恢复时期中和今年这一年里所学到的，和整个工业化事业的要求比较起来，还是十分不相适应的。我们必须继续刻苦地、丝毫也不松懈地努力学习。而最好的和最重要的学习方法之一，就是从实践中学习，从总结自己的成功和失败的经验中学习。就目前说来，就是要认真地总结一九五三年工业建设的经验，通过这次总结，提高领导水平，教育广大干部。过去，我们有些领导干部工作十分积极，十分忙碌，但不能有预见地提出努力方向和关键问题，正确地引导和充分发挥下面干部和群众的积极性。在他们所领导的部门或企业中，有些事做对了，但不能总结出经验来巩固、推广；有些事做错了，也不能研究出教训来防止、纠正。常常去年做错了的事情，今年又重犯同样的错误；这边纠正了，又偏到了那边去；这个单位走了弯路或碰了钉子，那个单位又重蹈覆辙；或者是这个单位早已解决了的问题，那个单位还在埋头摸索；先进的企业单位，先进的工人和技术人员创造的或学到的成功经验，也不能集中起来，加以推广，变成大家共同的财富。这些情况说明，总结经验对于我们从事工业建设的干部说来，不仅仅是一般意义上的领导方法或学习方法，而且有着更严重的实际意义。明年，工业建设的任务更加繁重，新建和扩建、改建的工程项目比今年更多，技术要求比今年更复杂，生产计划和各种经济技术指标也比今年高，如果我们不很好地总结今年的经验，不把已学会的本领巩固起来并加以推广，不把落后的单位提高，不设法避免在明年的工作中重复今年的错误，要完成国家交给我们的任务是很困难的。因此，各级工业领导部门和各个企业单位，必须充分认识总结一九五三年工业建设经验的重要意义，切实地认真地把这件工作做好。
    在总结工作中，各级工业部门和企业单位的领导干部，应该首先检查自己的领导思想。一九五三年，我们在基本建设方面曾大力反对了某些盲目冒进倾向，这对贯彻国家重点建设的方针起了重大作用。但是，这种倾向产生的根源何在，怎样才能在今后的工作中切实防止这种思想，以及在反对和纠正冒进倾向时，又如何防止和克服缩手缩脚的保守倾向？在生产方面，今年年初我们曾反对了某些保守倾向，许多部门和企业的计划都订得比较先进。但是，这一年实践的结果也证明有些部门的生产计划仍是保守的，个别部门甚至没有费什么力气就超额完成了全年的计划。同时在制订一九五四年生产计划时，在某些部门和企业中，一方面是没有达到国家的计划指标，一方面又觉得这次订计划不如春天“紧张”。产生这些现象的根源又是什么？在今年年初，毛主席发出了克服官僚主义的号召，此后，各个工业部门都根据毛主席指示的精神，对本部门的工作进行了深入的调查研究，作了通盘的部署。现在，这些部署贯彻得怎样，各个部门和企业在改进领导作风方面获得了那些成绩，还存在着那些缺点，应当如何改进？还有，在今年的工作中，各个部门和企业单位都感到相互间的配合协作是做好工业建设工作的一个极为重要的条件，都采取了一些措施以加强协作，这一方面的工作又作得怎样？这些问题，都必须深入地、具体地分析研究，总结出经验教训，以便保证我们一九五四年的工业建设沿着正确的轨道前进。
    在总结中，各级领导机关，特别是厂矿企业和基本建设单位的领导干部，还应该很好地总结企业管理方面的经验，以及今年增产节约运动的经验。今年，多数工业部门和基本建设单位在实行计划管理和贯彻责任制方面，在加强技术管理方面，都获得了显著的成绩。特别是增产节约运动开始以后，许多企业进一步改善了管理工作，注意了供、产、销的结合，并开展了以技术改革和劳动组织的改革为主要内容的群众性的劳动竞赛，从而保证按期完成和超额完成了国家的生产计划和基本建设计划。但是，今年改进企业管理的工作和增产节约运动的发展是很不平衡的。就全国说来，虽然大家在管理上都有进步，但真正在各方面都做得好的还不很多，还有不少厂矿做得比较差，或者某些方面做得比较差。在增产节约运动中，事故多，质量低的毛病还比较普遍，推广先进经验的工作在多数部门和地区都做得不好。这些成绩和缺点也都必须很好地总结。当然，在进行这方面的总结时，各个部门和单位都应该根据自己的情况和特点，选择不同的重点。如煤矿生产部门就应着重总结如何使地质、掘进、采矿三部分工作互相适应，均衡地前进；机械工业部门就应着重总结如何提高技术水平，树立为用户服务的思想，以求迅速地增加新品种，逐步解决一方面不能满足国家建设需要，另一方面生产效能又不能充分发挥的根本矛盾等等。
    在总结今年的工作中，各个部门和企业的领导干部也应该组织和帮助技术人员和工人总结技术方面的经验。在今年的基本建设和生产中，广大工人群众和技术人员表现了高度的创造精神，出现了大量的先进技术经验。特别是在有苏联专家直接帮助的企业中，更开始学习着或学会了若干对顺利地进行基本建设和提高生产效率有决定意义的先进经验。如果我们很好地把这些经验集中起来，加以整理推广，就可以大大地提高劳动生产率，加速我们工业建设的进程。特别是明年我们要开始新建许多最重要的工程，在这些工程中，如果不掌握苏联的先进经验和先进技术，不但谈不上劳动效率的提高，而且简直可以说是寸步难行。因此，我们在总结今年的基本建设经验的时候，必须特别着重总结重点工程的经验。
    最后，各个地区和各个企业中的党的组织，还必须很好地总结在企业中进行政治工作的经验。要检查和总结如何向职工群众宣传党在过渡时期的总路线，提高职工的觉悟，克服职工中某些不正确的思想，使他们鼓舞起更高的热情和勇气为实现社会主义工业化而斗争的工作经验，要总结如何领导工会和青年团配合行政改进企业管理和全面均衡地完成国家计划的经验，以及检查是否有放弃了政治工作或脱离生产去搞政治工作的倾向等等。
    要作好一九五三年工作总结，还必须采取正确的态度和方法。这就是说，必须各级领导干部亲自动手，以保证总结的质量和通过总结工作切实提高领导水平。必须根据本部门工作的特点和今年实际工作中的主要问题，有重点地进行深入的检查、分析和总结，以求得在工作的主要方面找出获得成绩或造成缺点和错误的原因，总结出真正有益的经验教训。必须发扬批评与自我批评的精神，和实事求是的深入调查研究的态度，充分吸取群众的意见，发动群众来参加总结。最后，也是最重要的，就是必须贯彻总结乃是为了改进工作的精神，根据总结出来的经验教训，结合明年的工作任务，切实地拟出改进的方法和具体的措施计划。譬如，各级领导干部就应迅速地拟出一九五四年本部门的工作方针和部署，使得所属职工在一年之始就有了明确的奋斗方向。这样，我们才能够说是全面地完成了一九五三年的任务，才能信心百倍地迎接一九五四年工业建设上的新的胜利。
