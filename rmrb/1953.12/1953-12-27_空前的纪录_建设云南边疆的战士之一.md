    Unprecedented Record
    ——One of the Soldiers Building the Yunnan Frontier
    Guo Guofu
      Ni Pingzhou, squad leader of an engineering company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, is a famous machine gunner. Now, to build the frontier, he has accepted the task of drilling blast holes and quarrying stone. What he holds in his hands is no longer a machine gun but a hammer and a drill rod. Ni Pingzhou led a group to a high and large rocky mountain. Standing on the top of the mountain, he looked around and saw the mountain was full of large rocks of varying heights. Ni Pingzhou thought to himself, "How many houses could be built with these stones!"

    Ni Pingzhou found the first blast hole on a round, protruding rock. He said to the group, "I'll hold the drill rod first." He bent down and tightly gripped the drill rod with both hands. Song Huaguo and Han Xiangchen each took a thirteen or fourteen-pound hammer. They swung the hammers high, as if they could hammer in three or four inches with each blow, but when they came down, they loosened their grip. They were afraid: what if they missed and broke their hands? After hitting a few times, Ni Pingzhou saw that only a white mark had been scraped on the stone. He looked up and said, "Don't be afraid, hit harder." Gradually, each hammer blow became heavier, and the "clang" sound became louder and louder. Each time the hammer came down with force, Ni Pingzhou would bite his lip tightly, because the vibration of the drill rod made his palms feel like they were about to crack open. That day, they drilled over sixty centimeters deep. Ni Pingzhou was covered in slurry, and more than a dozen large blisters rose on his hands.

    The next day, they only increased by ten centimeters or so.

    "What's the reason?" Ni Pingzhou was very dissatisfied with his results, as if he had lost a battle. In the evening, he called a meeting of the group, a Zhuge Liang meeting.

    The next day, he got up the earliest. According to the method discussed at the meeting, he first sharpened the drill rod to make it quick and bright, tied a "waterproof hat" to the drill rod to prevent the slurry from splashing on his face and body, and brought an automatic drip device on the drill rod to save water time, and also made a "grass protector" to reduce abrasions in case the hammer hit his hand. He himself still held the drill rod. With the "protector," Song Huaguo and the other two became bolder, and the hammers came down even harder, and the drill rod vibrated even more violently. The blisters on Ni Pingzhou's hands burst, and blood stuck to the heated drill rod.

    Han Xiangchen said, "Squad leader, take a break!"
    "No," Ni Pingzhou didn't even lift his head, "Hurry up and hit it, people of all ethnic groups are watching us!"

    That day, the recorder wrote 4.5 meters in the Ni Pingzhou group column.

    The Ni Pingzhou group's performance rose day by day: four meters, five meters, six meters.... At the same time, the blisters on their hands also rose layer by layer, the old ones were broken, and the new ones popped up again.

    During the day, even though his hands hurt so much that he couldn't even grip the drill rod, Ni Pingzhou never uttered a sound; but, when night came, in his own words: he had to pass the test. It felt like countless sparks were erupting in his palms, burning unbearably, and he couldn't sleep!

    Song Huaguo, who was sleeping next to him, asked, "Third Squad Leader, haven't you slept yet?"

    Ni Pingzhou said, "I'm going to sleep now."
      "Does it hurt?"
    "It hurts!" Then, he said again, "But, as long as the frontier is built sooner, what does it matter if we hurt a little? I always think that we are so happy to be born in such a good era, and we are catching up with the momentum! We have seen so many magical things and personally come to build the frontier."
    Song Huaguo turned his body with difficulty.
    "How do you feel? Can you hold on?"
      "Yes!"

    Ni Pingzhou was very satisfied with Song Huaguo's firm answer. He lowered his voice and said, "Old Song, we must persevere. Hey, did you hear what the company commander said? He said: Comrades, the task of building the frontier has been entrusted to us by the higher authorities. This is not something that can be completed in three or two years, this is a long-term job. I think, long-term is fine, you and I are both Communist Party members, and Communist Party members must fight to the end for the cause of communism. We must build the frontier into a socialist society."

    "It will be beautiful then!" Song Huaguo's voice was a little excited.
      "At that time, there will be collective farms everywhere, maybe even this rocky mountain will become an orchard!"

    The night was already very deep. Ni Pingzhou had not yet fallen asleep. He was thinking about tomorrow, tomorrow, he should drill fifty centimeters more than today!

    The record of Ni Pingzhou's group drilling blast holes continued to rise. This day, they drilled more than fifteen meters. The news spread throughout the company, and also reached the ears of an old stonemason in the local area. After hearing this, he shook his head and said, "Don't fool me, this is not like drilling tofu!" How could he believe it? In his life experience, no one had ever exceeded four meters. When he personally went to the mountain, saw Ni Pingzhou, and saw the blasted stone, after everything was confirmed, he exclaimed, "Chairman Mao's soldiers are all capable people, you guys are good."

    空前的纪录
    ——建设云南边疆的战士之一
    郭国甫
      人民解放军某部工兵连三班班长倪平洲，是著名的机枪手。现在，为了建设边疆，他接受了打炮眼、开石方的任务。握在他手里的已经不是机枪而是铁锤和炮杆了。倪平洲带着一个小组走上了一座又高又大的石山。他站在山顶上，展眼一望，满山都是高高低低的大石头，倪平洲心里想：“这些石头，要开出来能垒多少房子呵！”
    倪平洲在一块圆突突的大石上找好了第一个炮眼。他对小组的人说：“我先掌杆。”他弯下腰，两手紧紧地捏着炮杆。宋华国、韩相臣一人拿一把十三四斤重的铁锤。锤抡的很高，看样子，一下就能锤进三四寸似的，可是，放下来时，却松劲了。他们怕：要是锤偏了，不要把手给砸断吗？打了几下，倪平洲一看，石头上才擦了道白印印。他抬起头说：“不要怕，打重点。”渐渐地，一锤比一锤下重了，“叮当”声也一声比一声更响了。就这时，铁锤每一次猛力落下来，倪平洲总要紧咬一下自己的嘴唇，因为炮杆震的手虎口像要裂开一样。这天，他们打了六十几公分深。倪平洲满身粘的是灰浆，两只手鼓起十几个大血泡。
    过了一天，增加的只是十来公分。
    “原因究竟在那儿呢？”倪平洲像打了败仗一样，十分不满意自己的成绩。晚上，他召集小组的人，开了次诸葛亮会。
    第二天，他起的最早。照会上研究好的办法，他先把炮杆磨的又快又亮，在炮杆上扎了个“防水帽”，使炮眼的灰浆不能溅在脸上和身上，又在炮杆上带了个自动滴水器可以节省上水的时间，还做了个“草护圈”以减轻万一铁锤碰在手上时的擦伤。他自己仍然掌杆。有了“护圈”，宋华国他们俩胆子就大了，锤下的更猛了，炮杆也震的更凶了。倪平洲两手的泡破了，血粘在发了热的炮杆上。
    韩相臣说：“班长，你歇一会吧！”
    “不，”倪平洲头也没抬，“快点打吧，各族人民都在看着咱们呢！”
    这天，记录员在倪平洲小组栏内，写着四点五公尺。
    倪平洲小组的成绩一天一天往上升：四公尺、五公尺、六公尺……。与这同时，他们三人手上的泡，也一层高一层，旧的揭破了，新的又冒出来。
    白天，尽管手痛的连炮杆都捏不紧，倪平洲从来都没哼一声；但，一到夜晚，用他自己的话说：是要过关了。手心里像有无数的火星在爆发，烧的受不住，想睡，睡不着！
    睡在他旁边的宋华国问：“三班长，还没睡吗？”
    倪平洲说：“现在就睡了。”
      “痛吧？”
    “痛！”接着，他又说，“不过，只要边疆早一天建设好，咱们痛一点又算什么呢？我总这样想，咱们是多么幸福呀，生在这样的好时代，算是赶在劲头上啦！咱们看到了多少个神奇的事，还亲自来建设边疆。”
    宋华国在艰难地转动着他的身子。
    “你觉得怎样？能坚持吗？”
      “能！”
    倪平洲十分满意宋华国这样坚定的回答。他又压低声音说：“老宋，咱们一定要坚持。嘿，你听连长说吗？他说：同志们，建设边疆的任务，上级交给咱们了，这不是三年两年就能完成的，这是个长期的工作。我想，长期就长期呗，你，我，都是共产党员，共产党员要为共产主义事业奋斗到底。咱们一定要把边疆建设成社会主义社会才算。”
    “到那会才美呢！”宋华国声音有些激动了。
      “到那会，到处是集体农庄啦，说不定这石山上都成了果树林哩！”
    夜已经很深了。倪平洲还没有入睡。他在想着明天，明天，应该比今天多打五十公分才对呢！
    倪平洲小组打炮眼的记录不停地上升着。这天，他们打了十五公尺多了。这个消息在连队传开了，也传到了当地一位老石匠耳里。他听了后，摆了摆头说：“你们别哄我，这又不是打豆腐！”他怎么能相信呢？在他一生的经历中，从来没有人上过四公尺。当他亲自到了山上，见到了倪平洲，见到了炸开的石方，一切都证实了以后，他赞叹地说：“毛主席的战士都是能人，算你们有本事。”
