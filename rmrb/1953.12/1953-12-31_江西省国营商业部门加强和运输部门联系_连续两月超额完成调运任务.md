To coordinate grain purchases and ensure the supply of goods to rural areas, Jiangxi Province's state-owned commercial departments closely cooperated with transportation and loading/unloading departments in October and November. They seized the opportunity to transport large quantities of goods suitable for rural sales to grassroots sales units in advance, strengthening their ability to vigorously sell these goods. The province's state-owned commercial departments completed 108% of their October plan for transporting goods to various special districts, counties, and towns, and 102% of their November plan. A total of over 58,000 tons of transportation tasks were completed in two months, setting an unprecedented record.

The significant achievements in the province's material transportation work are primarily attributed to the importance attached to it by the Provincial Finance Committee and the Department of Commerce. Li Jieyong, Deputy Director of the Provincial Finance Committee, personally supervised the close cooperation between the consignment, transportation, and loading/unloading departments to complete the material transportation tasks. The Provincial Department of Commerce, led by its Storage and Transportation Section in conjunction with various specialized companies, formed a unified material transportation command structure to ensure unified command and centralized dispatching. In the past, some state-owned commercial departments in the province did not pay enough attention to transportation plans, and their consignment plans were inaccurate, and the implementation of plans was not taken seriously. In addition, the connection between the consignment department and the carrier department was insufficient, resulting in improper allocation of vehicles and ships: either there were more vehicles and ships than goods, causing a waste of national transportation capacity; or there were fewer vehicles and ships than goods, which delayed waiting times and backlog goods in transit. Now, under the unified control of the Provincial Finance Committee and the centralized dispatching of the Department of Commerce, the province's specialized companies have strengthened ties with the Inland Navigation Administration Bureau and the Transportation Bureau, exchanging monthly and semi-monthly plans for requesting ships and vehicles, as well as plans for allocating transportation capacity, and exchanging information. Each specialized company has a dedicated person responsible for contacting and grasping the time, variety, and quantity of goods transferred in from outside the province, in transit, waiting for shipment, and arriving, and reporting these situations to the Department of Commerce every day, and contacting the transportation department, in order to timely allocate vehicles and ships. The transportation department has also established a vehicle and ship dynamic reporting system, so that each port can know the arrival date of ships in advance, contact the loading and unloading department and the consignment department, and immediately organize loading and unloading workers to quickly unload the goods upon arrival of the cargo ship, and then immediately load new goods and set sail, reducing the berthing time of ships in the port, increasing the number of voyages, and accelerating the completion of material transportation tasks. For example, the materials transferred from Zhangshu to Ganzhou used to take 60 days in general, including 30 days waiting for transportation in Zhangshu, and 30 days for the 370-mile upstream voyage between Zhangshu and Ganzhou. Now, the waiting time has been reduced to no more than one week, and the time in transit for water-land combined transportation is only about 15 days. The Provincial Department of Commerce concentrates and dispatches according to the transportation plans of various specialized companies, and queues up the transportation sequence according to the commodities. For example, the transportation volume of Ganjiang River accounts for the largest proportion of the province's domestic transportation volume. In view of the situation that the water is dry in winter, the transportation capacity is insufficient, and the quantity of transported materials is huge, the Provincial Department of Commerce queues up according to the allocation of transportation tools, uses ships to drag and transport the most urgently needed materials, and only uses civilian ships to transport general materials, giving full play to and utilizing the different transportation efficiency of various transportation tools. The Provincial Department of Commerce also stipulates that all materials of each company should be delivered to the Navigation Affairs Bureau for transportation, so that the Navigation Affairs Bureau can uniformly control and organize private transportation capacity, and implement a unified freight rate, unified source of goods, and unified dispatching method for private ships. At the same time, the Navigation Affairs Bureau has strengthened the organization and allocation of civilian ships, so that civilian ships can be gradually incorporated into the track of national planned transportation, and closely connect the transshipment work between ships and civilian ships.

In addition to strengthening contacts with the carrier and handling departments to solve the problem of timely allocation of transportation capacity, the state-owned commercial departments in Jiangxi Province have also come up with some new methods in their own allocation procedures, transportation methods, and warehousing procedures, shortening the time for material transshipment, and saving handling labor and transportation costs. For example, in early October, Nanchang Department Store Wholesale Station changed to the method of allocating goods at the station and wharf. After the goods arrived at the station and wharf, they were allocated and distributed at the station and wharf without going through the procedures of warehousing and warehousing, which greatly improved the work efficiency of allocation and transportation. At the most tense time of the transportation task, Nanchang Department Store Wholesale Station sent ten cadres to the station to work at the station, including business, storage and transportation, allocation, balance, price personnel, and tax personnel, and the deputy manager of the station personally led the team. When the goods arrived at the station, they were arranged in order, stacked separately according to the large categories of commodities, and the procedures for pricing, balancing, paying taxes, and shipping were handled in a timely manner. This simplified eleven of the fourteen procedures for receiving and dispatching goods in the past. Following the Nanchang Department Store Wholesale Station, the province's Cotton Yarn Company, Livestock Company, Tobacco and Hemp Company, Coal and Building Materials Company, and Jiujiang and Shangrao Department Store Wholesale Stations also adopted this method of transferring directly at the station. Using this method, it is estimated that in the fourth quarter alone, the commodity circulation costs can be saved by 500 million yuan for state-owned commercial departments in Nanchang City. In addition to implementing direct shipping from ships and transfer at stations, the province's Cotton Yarn Company has further adopted the "allocation at the factory" method, so that the yarn and cloth processed locally in Nanchang, Jiujiang and other places do not have to go through the procedures of warehousing, and can be allocated and transported as long as they are inspected and taxed in the factory. After Nanchang Department Store Wholesale Station adopted the method of allocation at the factory, the locally processed goods that originally took five days to ship out can be shipped out in only two days, shortening the time by three-fifths.

In addition, the state-owned commercial departments in Jiangxi Province have also made a lot of achievements in selecting transportation tools, changing unreasonable transportation routes, changing purchasing locations to shorten transportation distances, consolidating LCL cargo into full truckloads, and improving loading technology to increase the loading capacity per unit ton, saving a lot of commodity circulation costs.

    江西省国营商业部门加强和运输部门联系
    连续两月超额完成调运任务
    为配合购粮保证农村物资供应，江西省国营商业部门在十、十一月份与运输部门和搬运部门密切配合，抓紧了物资调运工作，把大量适合农村销售的商品提前调拨运送到了基层销货单位，充实了基层单位大力销售的物资力量。该省国营商业部门十月份调运物资往各专区、县镇的计划完成了百分之一○八，十一月份的调运计划也完成了百分之一○二。两个月共完成了五万八千余吨的调运任务，创造了空前的纪录。
    该省物资调运工作之所以能取得这样大的成绩，主要是由于省财委和商业厅的重视。省财委李杰庸副主任亲自督促托运、承运、搬运部门紧密配合，以完成物资调运任务。省商业厅则以该厅储运科为主结合各专业公司组成统一的物资调运指挥机构，借以统一指挥，集中调度。过去，该省有些国营商业部门对运输计划重视不够，编制的托运计划不准确，执行计划也不认真。再加托运部门与承运部门的联系也不够，以致车船调配不当：或者车船多货物少，造成国家运输力量的浪费；或者车船少货物多，使得待运时间拖长，货物在途积压。现在，在省财委的统一掌握、商业厅的集中调度下，该省各专业公司与内河航运管理局及运输局加强了联系，逐月交换分旬要船要车计划及运力调度分配计划，互通情报。各专业公司有专人负责联系掌握货物从省外调进、在途、待运、运达的时间、品种和数量，并把这些情况每日向商业厅汇报，和运输部门联络，以便及时调配车船。运输部门也建立了车辆、船舶动态报告制度，以便各港口能够预知船舶到达日期，联系搬运部门和托运部门，货船一到即组织搬运工人迅速卸货，卸后又马上另装新货开航，减少船舶在港口停泊时间，增加航行次数，加速完成物资调运任务。例如由樟树转运至赣州的物资，过去一般要六十天时间，其中在樟树待运三十天，樟树赣州之间上水运程三七○里要三十天，现在，待运时间减至不超过一星期，水陆联运在途时间只要十五天左右。省商业厅则根据各专业公司的调运计划集中调度，按商品进行调运次序的排队。例如赣江运输量占该省省内运输量的比重最大，针对冬季枯水时期、运力不足而调运物资数量又浩大的情况，该省商业厅就根据运输工具调配情况进行排队，将最急需的物资用轮船拖运，一般物资只用民船运，发挥和利用了各种运输工具不同的运输效能。省商业厅又规定各公司物资一律向航务局交运，以便航务局统一掌握组织私营运力，实行对私营轮船统一运价、统一货源、统一调派的办法。同时，航务局又加强民船的组织调配工作，使民船逐步纳入国家计划运输的轨道中来，并密切衔接轮船民船间的接运工作。
    除与承运、搬运部门加强联系解决了运力的及时调配问题以外，该省国营商业部门还在本身的调拨手续、运输方法、进出仓手续等方面想出了一些新的办法，缩短了物资转运的时间，节约了搬运力资和运输费用。例如南昌百货批发站在十月初改用就车站、码头调拨的方法，货到车站、码头后，就在车站码头调拨分运，不再经过进仓和出仓的手续，大大提高了调拨运输上的工作效率。在调运任务最紧张的时候，南昌百货批发站曾派干部十人到车站去驻站办公，其中包括业务、储运、调拨、平衡、物价人员及办税务的人员，并由该站副经理亲自领导，商品到了车站，排定次序，按商品大类分别堆放，及时办理定价、平衡、缴税及启运手续。这样就把过去商品收发的十四道手续简化了十一道。继南昌百货批发站之后，该省花纱布公司、畜产公司、烟麻公司、煤建公司和九江、上饶两百货批发站等单位也都采用了这种就站转拨的方法。采用这种方法，预计仅南昌市一地在第四季度就可为国营商业部门节省商品流转费用五亿元。该省花纱布公司除实行了就船直运和就站转拨外，还进一步采取了“就厂调拨”的办法，使南昌、九江等地当地加工的纱布不必经过进出仓的手续，只要在厂里验收纳税后就可分运。南昌百货批发站采用就厂调拨方法后，使原需五天才能运出的当地加工商品，只要两天就可运出，缩短了五分之三的时间。
    此外，该省国营商业部门在选择运输工具、改变不合理的运输路线、改变购货地点以缩短运输距离、并零担货物为整车装运、改进装载技术以提高单位吨位的装载量等等方面也有了不少的成绩，节约了大量商品流转费用。　（严钊）
