Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 24th: The U.S. side is now vigorously clamoring to forcibly detain Korean and Chinese prisoners of war on January 22nd next year, and publicly stated that they will be sent to the Li Seung-man and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs to serve as cannon fodder. They are obviously prepared to do anything to salvage the failure of their "psychological warfare."

On the 22nd, Dulles declared at a luncheon at the National Press Club in Washington that he had "no doubt" that the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war in Tongchang-ri would be "released as civilians" in South Korea or Taiwan on January 22nd. Following Dulles, U.S. Far East Commander Hull issued a statement on the 23rd. Hull also distorted the Korean Armistice Agreement, insisting that the explanation work for prisoners of war should end on December 23rd, and said that on January 22nd, the Indian forces would no longer have the power to guard the prisoners of war, and the prisoners of war would be "eligible to become civilians" and "will be able to go to any country of their choice." He also openly declared that he had notified Li Seung-man and the Kuomintang bandit gangs that his command "will use all available facilities" to "expedite the transfer" of prisoners of war to them.

Dulles and Hull also attempted to shirk their responsibility for undermining the explanation work. Dulles insisted that 22 American prisoners of war who requested to hear full explanations refused repatriation, saying that their talks "did not reflect their true feelings," attempting to cover up the fact that the U.S. side did not care about the fate of their prisoners of war and refused to conduct individual explanations for them. Hull even blatantly blamed all the evil deeds of the U.S. side, such as undermining the explanation, interfering with the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, and creating difficulties for the Indian custodial forces, on the Korean and Chinese sides.

However, a United Press news item from Taipei on the 23rd exposed Dulles and Hull for what they were. The UPI reported that so-called "qualified American observers" in Taiwan believed that the U.S. move to hijack prisoners of war to Taiwan would be "handled in close contact" between the U.S. and the Kuomintang bandit gangs. The UPI revealed that the U.S. would transport the prisoners of war from the demilitarized zone to "a barracks somewhere in South Korea and then load them onto military transport ships" to Taiwan. After arriving in Taiwan, the prisoners of war would be incorporated into the Kuomintang army. The UPI said that the Kuomintang bandit gang was "very concerned about the prisoners of war's physical condition, military training, and age." Because the Kuomintang bandit gangs' "normal sources of manpower have been cut off, they will grab whoever they can and use them."

The UPI report completely exposed Dulles and Hull's lies about "releasing prisoners of war as civilians" and that prisoners of war "will be able to go to any country of their choice," and revealed the truth about the collusion between the United States and the Li and Jiang bandit gangs in forcibly detaining prisoners of war. The UPI report also proves that the reason why the U.S. side has been trying its best to undermine the explanation work, and unilaterally decided to terminate the explanation on December 23rd, even at the expense of abandoning their own prisoners of war, is because they fear that if the explanation work continues, more prisoners of war will request repatriation. They fear that this will not only completely bankrupt their "cold war" propaganda, but also make it impossible to complete their plan to collect cannon fodder.

### 杜勒斯公然说要把朝中战俘送给李蒋匪帮

    杜勒斯公然说要把朝中战俘送给李蒋匪帮
      【新华社开城二十四日电】美方现在竭力叫嚷要在明年一月二十二日强迫扣留朝中被俘人员，并公然表示要把他们送给李承晚和蒋介石匪帮充当炮灰。他们显然准备不择手段地来挽救他们“心理战”的失败。
    二十二日，杜勒斯在华盛顿全国新闻俱乐部午餐会上宣称，他“没有疑问”认为在东场里的朝中被俘人员在一月二十二日将在南朝鲜或台湾“释放而为平民”。继杜勒斯之后，远东美军总司令赫尔在二十三日发表了一项声明。赫尔同样曲解朝鲜停战协定，硬说对战俘的解释工作应在十二月二十三日终止，并且说到一月二十二日印度部队就将不再有权力看管战俘，而战俘则将“有资格成为平民”，并“将能够到他们所能选择的任何国家去”。他又公开宣称，他已经通知李承晚和国民党匪帮说，他的司令部“将使用一切可以得到的便利条件”来把战俘“加速运送”给它们。
    杜勒斯和赫尔还企图推卸自己破坏解释工作的责任。杜勒斯硬说二十二名要求听取充分解释的美国战俘拒绝遣返，说他们的谈话“并不反映他们真正的感觉”，企图这样来掩饰美方不关心他们战俘的命运、拒绝对他们进行个别解释的事实。赫尔甚至干脆把美方破坏解释、干涉中立国遣返委员会的工作、给印度看管部队制造困难等一切罪恶行为，赤口白舌地全都推在朝中方面身上。
    可是合众社二十三日从台北发出的一条消息，却使杜勒斯和赫尔原形毕露了。合众社报道说，在台湾的所谓“有资格美国观察家”认为，美方将战俘劫往台湾这件事，将在美方和国民党匪帮“紧密联系之下予以处理”。合众社透露，美方将把战俘从非军事区劫运到“南朝鲜某地的一个营房中，然后再装上军用运输舰”运往台湾。战俘在到达台湾以后，就会被编入国民党军队。合众社说，国民党匪帮“非常关心战俘的体格、军事训练情况以及年龄”。国民党匪帮由于“人力正常来源已经断绝，是会抓到谁就用谁的”。
    合众社的报道彻底揭露了杜勒斯和赫尔的所谓将战俘“释放而为平民”、战俘“将能够到他们所能选择的任何国家去”的谎言，暴露了美国和李、蒋匪帮狼狈为奸、强迫扣留战俘的真相。合众社的报道也证明了：美方所以要竭力破坏解释工作，并且片面决定在十二月二十三日截止解释，甚至抛弃他们自己的战俘也在所不惜，是因为唯恐解释工作继续进行下去会有更多的战俘要求遣返。他们害怕这将不但使他们的“冷战”宣传完全破产，而且连搜罗炮灰的计划也无法完成。
