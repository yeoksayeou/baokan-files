    Seeing the Correct Path for Rural Economic Development From Two Villages
    Shao Xing, Secretary of the CPC Shahe County Committee, Hebei Province
   The small-scale peasant economy stands at a crossroads between capitalism and socialism. As long as we strengthen our leadership, we can guide it onto the path of socialism; otherwise, it will spontaneously take the capitalist road. This is an iron law of development. I have deeply felt this through my work.
    Shahe County is an old liberated area with a relatively solid foundation for our work. In recent years, thanks to the vigorous mutual aid and cooperation movement carried out by the People's Government, the county's farmers have gradually organized themselves, and agricultural production has significantly improved. Grain and cotton yields have greatly exceeded pre-war levels, and the miserable life of "half a year of bran and vegetables" is gone forever.
    However, economic development in the county is uneven. In some villages, because the Party leadership is relatively strong, they have implemented organization, and socialist elements are constantly growing. Farmers have exploited the advantages of collective labor, improved technology, and improved varieties, resulting in increased yields year after year. The living conditions of the masses are also improving day by day. In other villages, however, because the Party leadership is relatively weak, capitalist elements have grown spontaneously. A few farmers have become rich by exploitation, and some farmers have become impoverished by exploitation, creating a phenomenon of class differentiation. The materials from the following two villages illustrate this point.
    Renli Village has 126 households. After the land reform, because the local Party organization did not effectively lead the villagers to organize, class differentiation occurred. Many people not only hired long-term and short-term laborers but also lent money at high interest rates, exploiting farmers. According to a recent investigation, eight farmers in the village have embarked on the path of becoming rich peasants, becoming exploiters in the countryside. For example, Party member Ren Bingzi (who has been disciplined during the Party rectification) was originally a poor peasant. In recent years, he lent out 1,800 jin of wheat at high interest, earned a sum of money, bought several mu of paddy fields, built more than a dozen houses, and bought a rubber-wheeled cart. Now, he feeds a mule, a horse, and a donkey. In the same village, seven poor peasant households lost their houses and land under the exploitation of rich peasants, and some became hired laborers.
    Heinao Village in the Fifth District is a different story. This village is located on a barren hillside. Before liberation, all 26 households in the village were tenant farmers of the landlord Fan Xiumei in Longhua Village, Xingtai County. At that time, the whole village had only seven head of livestock and no sheep. Each mu of land was fertilized with about ten loads, and the average yield was more than 80 jin of grain. After deducting 65 shi of rent rice, little was left. Only three households had enough grain to eat barely. People lived a hard life of eating bran and vegetables, could not afford reed mats, and slept on earth beds, with an average of three people sharing one quilt. A cotton coat had to be worn for many winters. After liberation in 1944, the farmers of Heinao Village began to organize. After land reform (in 1952), the year-round mutual aid team developed into an agricultural production cooperative. As a result, the village's output increased year after year.
    Now, the Heinao Village Production Cooperative cultivates a total of 328 mu of dry land. Last year, the average yield per mu was 330 jin, more than four times higher than before the war. Although it suffered natural disasters this autumn, the yield remained at a certain level thanks to the efforts of all members, with an average yield of 324 jin of millet per mu. The living standards of all farmers have improved significantly, and they can generally eat millet flour, corn flour, and a certain amount of wheat flour; they have bought new cotton quilts and new clothes. According to a survey, out of the 26 households in the village, four have enough grain to eat for six years, four can eat for four years, and the remaining households can eat for an average of two years.
    In addition, the members carried out collective afforestation and proposed to fight for the greening of the mountains. This year, the income from peaches alone is equivalent to a wheat harvest. More than 1,000 apple trees have also begun to bear fruit.
    Here, people are actively engaged in construction, accumulating funds, and developing production. At present, the cooperative has public property: 6,000 jin of grain in the communal granary, 22,900 fruit trees, two head of cattle, 480 sheep, and 11 new-style agricultural implements. It has also built 40 sheepfolds, three houses, dug six pools, sunk two wells, and built a reservoir. Recently, the village built eight houses and opened a primary school.
    After receiving education on the general line, the people of Heinao Village are even more full of confidence in moving forward on the happy road of socialism and have sold more than 54,000 jin of grain to the state. The cooperative has already drawn up a five-year plan. It plans to use the money from selling grain to purchase new agricultural implements and several head of livestock.
    The economic development of Renli and Heinao villages clearly tells us that after land reform, we must actively and steadily lead farmers to organize and take the socialist road in order to free everyone from poverty.

### 从两个村子看农村经济发展的正确道路

    从两个村子看农村经济发展的正确道路
    中共河北省沙河县县委书记　邵星
   小农经济是站在资本主义与社会主义间的十字路口的经济，只要我们加强领导，可以引导它走社会主义的道路；否则，它就要自发地走资本主义的路。这是铁一般的发展规律。我从工作中深刻地体会了这一点。
    沙河县是老解放区，工作比较有基础。近几年来，由于人民政府大力开展了互助合作运动，全县农民逐步地组织起来，农业生产已有显著提高，棉粮产量已大大超过战前水平，“糠菜半年粮”的悲惨生活，已一去不复返了。
    但是，全县的经济发展是不平衡的。有的村庄因为党的领导比较坚强，实行组织起来，社会主义因素不断地增长。农民发挥了集体劳动的优越性，提高了技术，改良了品种，产量年年增加。群众的生活状况也就一天天改善。有的村则因党的领导比较薄弱，资本主义因素就自发地增长起来，少数农民依靠剥削致富，一部分农民因遭受剥削而贫困下来，造成阶级分化的现象。下面两个村子的材料就说明了这一点。
    任里村全村有一百二十六户，土地改革后，由于当地的党组织没有很好地领导全村人民组织起来，发生了阶级分化的现象，有许多人不仅雇了长工、短工，而且放高利贷，剥削农民。据最近调查，全村已有八户农民走上了富农的道路，成为农村的剥削者。例如，党员任丙子（整党中已受到处分）原是贫农，近年来以高利放出一千八百斤麦子，赚了一笔钱，就买了几亩水地，盖了十几间房子，买了一辆胶皮车。现在，他喂着骡、马各一匹，还有一头驴。就在同一个村庄里，却有七户贫农在富农的剥削下失去了房屋、土地，有的变成了雇工。
    五区的黑碯村却是另一种情况。这个村座落在一个荒山坡上。解放前，全村二十六户农民都是邢台县隆华底村地主范秀美的佃农。那时，全村只有七头牲口，一只羊也没有。每亩地施肥约十担，平均收八十多斤粮食，除去六十五石租米，所余就不多了，只有三户的粮食勉强够吃。人们过着吃糠咽菜的苦日子，买不起芦席，就睡在土炕上，平均三个人才有一条被子。一件棉衣得穿好多个冬天。一九四四年解放后黑碯村农民就开始组织起来；土地改革后（一九五二年），常年互助组发展成为农业生产合作社。因此，全村的产量一年比一年提高。
    现在，黑碯村生产合作社共耕种三百二十八亩旱地，去年每亩的平均产量是三百三十斤，比战前提高了四倍以上；今年秋天虽遭受到自然灾害，但在全体社员的努力下，产量仍保持在一定的水平上，每亩平均产谷子三百二十四斤。全体农民的生活有了显著的提高，普遍能吃到小米面、玉茭面和一定数量的面粉；置了新棉被、新衣服。据调查，全村二十六户中，有四户的粮食够吃六年，四户能吃四年，其余户的粮食平均能吃二年。
    此外，社员们还进行了集体造林，提出为绿化山区而斗争。今年光桃子一项的收入，就顶上一个麦收。一千多棵苹果树，也已开始结果。
    这里，人们正积极地进行着建设，积累资金，发展生产。目前，全社有公共财产义仓粮六千斤、果树二万二千九百株、牛两头、羊四百八十只、新式农具十一件。又建筑了羊圈四十间、房三间；挖了六个水池、打井两眼、修水库一处。最近，村里盖了八间房子，开办了一所小学校。
    在受到总路线教育以后，黑碯村人民更加满怀信心地朝着社会主义的幸福道路前进，把五万四千多斤粮食卖给了国家。全社已经订出了五年计划。打算把卖粮所得的钱购新式农具和几匹牲畜。
    任里、黑碯两个村子经济发展的情况，清楚地告诉我们：在土地改革以后，我们必须积极、稳步地领导农民组织起来，走社会主义的道路，才能使大家摆脱贫困。
