Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 30th -- At today's meeting of the secretaries of both sides of the Military Armistice Commission, Zhu Ran, Colonel and Secretary-General of the Korean-Chinese side, strongly protested the continuous violations of the armistice agreement by US military aircraft intruding into our airspace, and condemned the US side for adopting a denying attitude towards these violations of the agreement. Zhu Ran pointed out that between the signing of the armistice agreement and November 26, there were 103 incidents of US military aircraft violating the armistice agreement that our side raised in the Military Armistice Commission and the Secretaries' Meeting with concrete evidence. He demanded that the US side strictly prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.

Zhu Ran then pointed out that the US side had admitted to eleven aerial violations of the agreement in the early period after the armistice. However, since mid-October, the US side has adopted an attitude of flat denial towards these incidents. In order to deny the fact that the US is constantly violating the armistice agreement, the US side has recently fabricated so-called violations of the agreement by our aircraft out of thin air. This practice of reversing black and white by the US side can never cover up the fact that US military aircraft have violated the agreement by flying over our region hundreds of times.

The five aerial violations of the armistice agreement by the US side presented by the Secretary-General of the Korean-Chinese side today are as follows:

On November 19, at around 11:50, four US military jet aircraft intruded into the airspace over Guozhifeng in our area northwest of Goseong from the southeast, and then flew towards the sea. On the same day, at around 13:10, one US military twin-engine aircraft intruded into the airspace over our 597.7 Height and 537.7 Height near Shangganling from the southwest, and then flew towards the southeast. On November 21, at around 13:30, one US military twin-engine aircraft intruded into our airspace over Haeju and other places from the southwest, and then flew south. On November 24, at around 15:15, one US military twin-engine aircraft intruded into our airspace from the southeast, flying over Ongjin, Sinchon and other places, and then flew towards the southwest sea. On November 26, at around 13:20, one US military single-engine aircraft intruded into our airspace from the northeast, flying over Beishan, Maryangsan and other places in Suyu City, and then flew east.

    我方强硬抗议美机接连侵入我方地区上空
    并斥责美方对这些违反停战协定事件采取抵赖态度
    【新华社开城三十日电】军事停战委员会朝中方面秘书长朱然上校，今天在双方秘书长会议上强硬抗议美方军用飞机不断违反停战协定侵入我方上空，并斥责美方对这些违反协议事件采取抵赖的态度。朱然指出：在停战协定签字后到十一月二十六日之间发生的美方军用飞机违反停战协定事件，经我方在军事停战委员会和秘书长会议上提出并有确切材料的就有一百零三起。他要求美方今后严格防止同类事件的发生。
    朱然接着指出：美方在停战后初期曾经承认了十一次空中违反协议事件。但自十月中旬起，美方对这些事件采取了矢口否认的态度。美方为了抵赖美方不断违反停战协定的事实，最近竟然无中生有地制造所谓我方飞机违反协议的事件。美方这种颠倒黑白的作法，绝不能遮盖美方军用飞机成百次飞越我方地区上空违反协议的事实。
    朝中方面秘书长今天提出的美方五次空中违反停战协定事件如下：
    十一月十九日十一时五十分左右，美方军用喷气式飞机四架，由东南方向侵入高城西北我方地区的国枝峰上空后，向海面飞去。同日十三时十分左右，美方军用双引擎飞机一架，由西南方侵入上甘岭附近我方五九七点七高地及五三七点七高地等地上空后，向东南方飞去。十一月二十一日十三时三十分左右，美方军用双引擎飞机一架，由西南方侵入我方海州等地上空后，向南飞去。十一月二十四日十五时十五分左右，美方军用双引擎飞机一架，由东南方侵入我方领空，经瓮津、信川等地上空后，向西南海面飞去。十一月二十六日十三时二十分左右，美方军用单引擎飞机一架，由东北方侵入我方领空，经我方水郁市北山、马良山等地上空后，向东飞去。
