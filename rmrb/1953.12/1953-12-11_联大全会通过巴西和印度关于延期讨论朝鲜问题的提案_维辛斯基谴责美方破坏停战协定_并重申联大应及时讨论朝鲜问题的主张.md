Xinhua News Agency, New York, 9th: TASS reports that the United Nations General Assembly held a plenary session on the afternoon of the 8th to discuss the joint proposal of the Brazilian and Indian delegations on the Korean issue, which was submitted to the Assembly by the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly.

Soviet representative Andrei Y. Vyshinsky, in his speech, drew the representatives' attention to the fact that during the discussion of the adjournment of the General Assembly in the Political Committee, several representatives pointed out that the negotiations in Panmunjom were encountering serious difficulties. Vyshinsky said that the telegram from Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, which has been officially distributed to the delegations of the General Assembly as a formal document of the United Nations General Assembly, also proves the extremely serious situation that has occurred in the Panmunjom negotiations. Zhou Enlai, in his telegram, drew the attention of the United Nations General Assembly to the fact that the situation in Korea has now developed to a serious stage. According to Zhou Enlai's notification, during the ninety-day interpretation period stipulated in the armistice agreement, the Korean-Chinese side only conducted interpretation work for prisoners of war for seven days. Since the fifth forced suspension of the interpretation work, it has been impossible to resume for twenty days, and the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war in the Korean armistice agreement has suffered serious damage. Vyshinsky said that Zhou Enlai pointed out: At the same time, the talks on the issue of the political conference held in Panmunjom also encountered significant difficulties, and the convening of the political conference has been cunningly delayed.

Vyshinsky continued by saying that some representatives in the Political Committee insisted that discussing the Korean issue in the United Nations General Assembly now would only worsen the situation, and might even be harmful to the negotiations in Panmunjom. The Soviet delegation cannot agree with this view, because as long as the Assembly genuinely intends to promote the smooth progress of the negotiations, it can find ways to remove all obstacles hindering the smooth resolution of issues related to the convening of the political conference, thereby promoting the smooth resolution of the entire Korean issue.

The Soviet representative further said that, despite numerous obstacles, the Korean-Chinese side is still making great efforts at the Panmunjom meeting to reach an agreement on the issue of convening the political conference. However, the other side is not doing so; they are constantly undermining the armistice agreement. The armistice agreement stipulates that the interpretation work for prisoners of war should last for ninety days. Now it seems that this deadline cannot be met, because the interpretation work for Korean and Chinese prisoners of war is often forced to be interrupted due to the continuous disruption and other illegal actions by the special agents of Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek. Vyshinsky then mentioned the letters intercepted by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission from Syngman Rhee's special agents who attempted to sneak into the Dongchang-ri prisoner-of-war camp from areas controlled by the US military command. In this letter, the commander-in-chief of the South Korean Gendarmerie and the Kuomintang's so-called "embassy" instructed their special agents to disrupt the interpretation work in the prisoner-of-war camp and eliminate those Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who insisted on repatriation. Vyshinsky also pointed out the fact that the US side insisted on delaying the negotiation strategy.

Vyshinsky said that if the United Nations General Assembly turns a blind eye to this situation, it will not have fulfilled its responsibility to promote a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, which is related to maintaining and consolidating peace and international security. The decision to resume the eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly when necessary to discuss the Korean issue should be made under conditions that not only do not make it difficult to resume the session, but also ensure the most rapid and unhindered resumption. The proposal put forward by the Political Committee completely fails to meet this requirement. In this proposal, some restrictive conditions are put forward for the resumption of the eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly. Vyshinsky pointed out that as long as these conditions are carefully considered, it can be seen that the procedures for resuming the eighth session are extremely complicated and dangerous. This procedure will not be beneficial to the matter. On the contrary, it facilitates conspiracies to undermine all efforts to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. If we truly want to facilitate the resumption of the eighth session to continue discussing the Korean issue as much as possible, then the phrase "with the consent of a majority of the members of the United Nations" in item two of the proposal should be deleted. The amendment proposed by the Polish delegation is intended to achieve this goal. The Soviet delegation supports this amendment.

Vyshinsky concluded by saying that if the Soviet delegation does not insist on discussing the Korean issue at the Assembly at present, its starting point is that the eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly should be reconvened at any time when it is necessary to discuss this issue. To this end, the President of the Assembly must be given the power to reconvene the session.

Indian representative Menon then spoke, agreeing with Vyshinsky's view that the situation in Korea is serious. He emphasized that the issue of repatriating prisoners of war has reached a deadlock. Menon also said that it is best not to restrict the work of the President of the Assembly in reconvening the United Nations in any way. However, most representatives wanted to pass the joint proposal in its current form.

As a result of the Assembly vote, Poland's amendment to the joint proposal was rejected. The delegations of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, and Czechoslovakia voted in favor of this amendment. The representatives of Afghanistan, Burma, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Yemen abstained. Most of the representatives voted in favor of the joint proposal. The representatives of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, and Czechoslovakia abstained when voting on the joint proposal.

Subsequently, the Assembly discussed the Political Committee's proposal on Burma's complaint against the Kuomintang clique's aggression.

Polish representative Katz-Suchy said that the aggression against Burma by the Kuomintang bandits is a direct result of the United States' aid to the Kuomintang clique entrenched in Taiwan. The Polish representative said that despite the shortcomings of this proposal, he will still vote in favor of it because it is supported by the country most closely related to this issue - Burma.

The US representative and Kuomintang elements attempted to justify their failure to implement United Nations General Assembly Resolution 711 of April 23, 1953, which stipulated that the Kuomintang bandits be completely disarmed and withdrawn from Burma, on the pretext of difficulties that do not in fact exist.

Soviet representative Malik explained his reasons for voting. He said that the Soviet delegation did not oppose the entire proposal of the Political Committee. However, the Soviet delegation cannot agree with one of them, which suggests that the United States seems to have made efforts to withdraw the Chiang Kai-shek troops from Burma, and "expresses gratitude" to the United States, which is unfounded. Malik emphasized that the Political Committee rightly pointed out in the proposal that this withdrawal was limited and expressed concern about the small number of weapons handed over by the Chiang Kai-shek army. Therefore, the Political Committee firmly demanded that the parties concerned take measures to disarm and withdraw the Chiang Kai-shek army.

The Burmese representative said that the Burmese delegation was not completely satisfied with the Political Committee's proposal but would also vote in favor of it. Because this proposal in fact condemns the Kuomintang clique's aggression against Burma. At the same time, the Burmese representative expressed gratitude to the Soviet and Polish delegations for agreeing to support this proposal.

The Political Committee's proposal was passed by a vote of fifty-six. Those who voted in favor included the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, and Czechoslovakia. Kuomintang elements did not participate in the vote.

    联大全会通过巴西和印度关于延期讨论朝鲜问题的提案
    维辛斯基谴责美方破坏停战协定
    并重申联大应及时讨论朝鲜问题的主张
   【新华社十日讯】塔斯社纽约九日讯：联合国大会于八日下午举行全体会议，讨论了联合国大会政治委员会提交大会讨论的、关于朝鲜问题的巴西和印度代表团的联合提案。
    苏联代表安·扬·维辛斯基发言，提请代表们注意，在政治委员会讨论大会休会问题时，若干代表曾指出，板门店的谈判正遭遇到严重的困难。维辛斯基说，已作为联合国大会正式文件散发给大会各代表团的中华人民共和国外交部长周恩来的电报，也证明了板门店谈判中所发生的极端严重的局势。周恩来在电报中提请联合国大会注意朝鲜的局势目前发展到了严重的阶段。据周恩来通知，在停战协定规定的解释工作期限九十天中，朝中方面对战俘的解释工作只进行了七天，从解释工作第五次被迫停顿之后，至今已达二十天之久未能恢复，因之朝鲜停战协定中关于战俘遣返的协议已经遭受到了严重的破坏。维辛斯基说，周恩来指出：同时，在板门店举行的关于政治会议问题的会谈也遭遇到了重大的困难，政治会议的召开已被阴谋拖延。
    维辛斯基继续说，有些代表在政治委员会会议上硬说，现在联合国大会讨论朝鲜问题，只会使局势恶化，甚至只会有害于板门店的谈判。苏联代表团不能同意这种看法，因为只要大会真正有意促成谈判的顺利进行，它是可以设法扫除阻碍顺利解决有关召开政治会议问题的一切障碍，因而促进整个朝鲜问题的顺利解决的。
    苏联代表又说，虽然阻碍重重，可是朝中方面在板门店会议上仍在作巨大的努力，以求就有关召开政治会议问题达成协议。然而对方却不是这样，他们不断破坏停战协定。停战协定规定对战俘的解释工作为期九十天，现在看来这个期限是不能兑现的，因为在李承晚和蒋介石的特务百般捣乱和其他非法行动的阻挠之下，对朝中战俘的解释工作经常被迫中断。维辛斯基接着提到中立国遣返委员会在企图从美军司令部控制的地区潜入东场里战俘营的李承晚特务身上截获的信件。南朝鲜宪兵总司令官与国民党的所谓“大使馆”在这封信里指示他们的特务在战俘营破坏解释工作，并消灭那些坚持遣返的朝中战俘。维辛斯基并指出美方坚持拖延谈判的策略这一事实。
    维辛斯基说，联合国大会如果对这种情况不闻不问，就是没有尽到它促成朝鲜问题和平解决的职责，而朝鲜问题的和平解决是与维护和巩固和平与国际安全有关的。在必要的情况下恢复联合国第八届大会以便讨论朝鲜问题的决定，应在这样的条件下作出，这些条件不仅不会使复会发生困难，而且要保证最迅速和无阻碍地复会。政治委员会所提出的提案完全不能满足这一要求。在这一提案中对联合国第八届大会复会提出了一些限制条件。维辛斯基指出，只要把这些条件深思熟虑一下，就可以看出，第八届大会复会手续是极其复杂，而且是危险的。这种手续对事情是不会有益处的。相反的，它倒便利于破坏和平解决朝鲜问题的一切工作的阴谋。如果真正想要尽量便于恢复第八届大会以继续讨论朝鲜问题的话，那末提案中第二项“征得多数联合国会员国的同意”这句话就应该删去。波兰代表团提出的修正案就是为了要达到这一目的。苏联代表团拥护这一修正案。
    维辛斯基最后说，如果说苏联代表团不坚持目前在大会上讨论朝鲜问题，那末它的出发点就是：一旦有讨论这个问题的必要时，联合国第八届大会应在任何时间复会。为此，必须赋予大会主席以复会的权力。
    印度代表梅农接着发言，他同意维辛斯基所说的朝鲜局势严重的意见。他着重说，遣返战俘的问题已陷入僵局。梅农还说，最好不要以任何条件来约束大会主席进行联合国复会的工作。可是，大多数代表却想通过目前形式的联合提案。
    大会表决结果，波兰对联合提案的修正案遭到否决。苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克代表团投票赞成这个修正案。阿富汗、缅甸、沙特阿拉伯、叙利亚和也门代表弃权。大多数代表投票赞成联合提案。苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的代表在投票表决联合提案时弃权。
    随后，大会讨论了政治委员会关于缅甸控诉国民党集团侵略案的提案。
    波兰代表卡茨—苏希说，国民党匪帮侵略缅甸，是美国援助盘据台湾的国民党集团的直接结果。波兰代表说，尽管这个提案中有着缺点，他仍将投票赞成这个提案，因为它受到与这个问题有最密切关系的国家——缅甸的支持。
    美国代表和国民党分子企图藉口事实上并不存在的困难，来为他们不执行联合国大会一九五三年四月二十三日的决议作辩护，这个决议规定国民党匪帮完全解除武装，并撤出缅甸。
    苏联代表马立克说明他投票的理由。他说，苏联代表团不反对政治委员会的整个提案。但苏联代表团对其中一项不能同意，这项建议说，美国似乎曾为撤退缅境的蒋介石部队作了努力，而对美国“表示感谢”，这是毫无根据的。马立克着重指出，政治委员会在提案中公正地指出了这种撤退是有限的，并对蒋介石军队缴出武器之少表示忧虑，因此，政治委员会坚决要求有关方面采取使蒋介石军队解除武装和撤退的措施。
    缅甸代表说，缅甸代表团不完全满意政治委员会的提案，但也将投票赞成。因为这个提案事实上已在谴责国民党集团对缅甸的侵略。同时，缅甸代表对苏联和波兰代表团同意支持这个提案表示感谢。
    政治委员会的提案以五十六票通过。投赞成票的包括苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克，国民党分子没有参加投票。
