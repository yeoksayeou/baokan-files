Chinese Friends, We Thank You
An Xianji, Model Worker of Pyongyang Textile Factory

I will never forget that more than three years ago, during the most difficult period in our country, Pyongyang fell in flames, and we retreated north. At this time, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army came and, together with our people, resisted and defeated the American bandits. We returned to Pyongyang. Pyongyang was destroyed, and the largest textile factory in our republic, which we built with our own hands, was reduced to ruins. We had no tears, only hatred, and hatred is strength. We, the young women, took on the work of the male comrades who went to the front lines, and we were determined to restore our factory. While digging tunnels in the mountains, we collected machines and parts from the ruins and transported them to the tunnels for installation. Transportation was difficult, so we carried them on our heads, lifted them on our shoulders, and pulled them by hand. Many people's heads ached, their shoulders were swollen, and their wrists were sore. But we gritted our teeth and moved them piece by piece. At this time, the trucks of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army came to help us pull them. Soon, our spindles were turning in the tunnels, and batches of military uniforms were sent to the front.

In January of this year, enemy planes once again bombed our factory wildly. The machines in the tunnels were destroyed again, and everything we had was burned. It was a cold winter month, and there was a heavy snow outside. At this time, the Chinese people sent us cotton clothes again. We wore them during the day for work and covered ourselves with them at night for sleep. Looking at the damaged machines and the cotton clothes we were wearing, the hatred produced strength, and the gratitude produced even greater strength. We worked day and night, repairing machines and preparing for production. The factory, which was originally planned to be restored in a week, was fully operational on the fourth day.

Now, we are going to restore the construction of our own country, but the damage caused by the war is so severe, and the difficulties are indeed great. At this time, aid from the Soviet Union and China has arrived again. I and all the workers in our fine yarn workshop cannot express our gratitude! Everyone has only one wish: only by working hard can we repay the support of the fraternal countries. Therefore, our factory started full operation ten days ahead of schedule.

I believe that with the help of fraternal countries, the leadership of the Workers' Party and Marshal Kim Il-sung, and our own hardworking hands, our ideals will surely be realized: in three years, our factory will surely develop into a huge integrated factory with 60,000 spindles, with cotton spinning, wool spinning, weaving, and hosiery.

    中国朋友，我们感激你
    平壤纺织厂模范工人　安贤姬
    我永远不能忘记，三年多以前，我们祖国最困难的时期，平壤在烟火中沦陷了，我们向北撤退。这时候，中国人民志愿军来了，和我们的人民一起把美国强盗顶住了，打垮了。我们又回到了平壤。平壤毁灭了，我们亲手建立起来的共和国的最大纺织厂成了一片废墟。我们没有眼泪，只有仇恨，仇恨就是力量。我们，年轻的姑娘们，担起了走向前线的男同志的工作，我们决心恢复自己的工厂。一边在山上挖掘山洞，一边从废墟中收拾机器和零件，运到山洞里安装。运输工具困难，我们就用头顶，用肩抬，用手拉，多少人的头顶疼了，肩膀肿了，手腕酸了。但我们咬紧牙关，一件件地搬。这时候，中国人民志愿军的汽车来了，帮我们拉，很快，我们的纱锭在山洞中转动起来了，一批一批的军衣送上了前方。
    今年一月，敌机又一次狂炸了我们的工厂，山洞里的机器又被破坏，我们的一切都被烧光，冷冬寒月，外面一片大雪。这时候，中国人民又给我们送来了棉衣，我们白天穿着工作，晚上盖着睡觉。看看被破坏的机器，看看身上的棉衣，仇恨产生的是力量，感激产生的是更大的力量。我们不分白天黑夜，装修机器，准备生产，原计划一星期恢复的工厂，第四天就全部开工了。
    现在，我们又要恢复自己祖国的建设，可是，战争破坏得多么厉害，困难的确很大。这时候，苏联和中国的援助又来了。我和我们细纱车间全体工人都无法说明自己的感激！大家只有一个心愿，只有好好劳动，才能报答兄弟国家的支援。所以，我们工厂提早十天全面开工了。
    我相信，有兄弟国家的帮助，有劳动党和金日成元帅的领导，再加上有我们勤劳的一双手，我们的理想一定能够实现：三年之后，我们的工厂就一定会发展到有六万纱锭，有棉纺、毛纺，有织布、织袜的巨大的综合工厂了。
