Since the national forest industry system launched the campaign to increase production and practice economy, it has achieved remarkable results in strengthening planning management, improving production technology, increasing labor efficiency, and reducing costs. According to incomplete statistics, forest industry bureaus in Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, Liaodong, Dailing, and Linjiang have completed their annual production tasks ahead of schedule. It is expected that the country will overfulfill its production tasks this year.

The Northeast Forest Industry Administration has reduced intermediate levels and implemented a system of operational planning and scheduling, so that problems occurring in production every day can be reflected in a timely manner and resolved through production meetings. For example, in mid-October, the Emu, Dashitou, Wangqing, and Shihuanzhen forest industry bureaus found that there was a risk of failing to complete the sleeper production task. The administration used scheduling calls to closely link the timber collection and transportation processes, and as a result, the sleeper task was overfulfilled in October. After strengthening the political and ideological leadership of employees in various regions, there have been significant achievements in improving technology and increasing labor efficiency. Workers at the Linjiang Forest Industry Bureau created the "gui leng machine," which greatly reduced heavy physical labor and increased the daily gui leng quota per person from 7.43 cubic meters to 15 cubic meters. The forest railway transportation volume of the Shuangyashan Forest Industry Bureau increased from 600 cubic meters per day to 1,000 cubic meters. In the past, one person was responsible for three flatcars for transporting timber at the Sanchazi Forest Industry Bureau. After promoting the "one person for five cars method" experimented by the Zhai Fengdian advanced team, the labor of 43 flatcar workers and 75 auxiliary workers can be saved every day. The Shihuanzhen Forest Industry Bureau transported 118,000 cubic meters of timber to the final yard by truck, reducing five processes and saving 1.76 billion yuan. Employees of the Dailing Forest Industry Experimental Bureau carried out simple processing of more than 20,000 cubic meters of substandard timber that had been backlogged for more than two years, increasing the country's net income by more than 1.58 billion yuan. In the Central and Southern regions, the implementation of the assembly line method in inspection generally increased work efficiency by 50 percent. Hongjiang in Hunan, Ji'an in Jiangxi, and other places have canceled the practice of making water holes in timber and improved the oars used for timber rafting, greatly saving timber. In the forest areas of Fujian, labor efficiency has been increased by 10 percent due to improved felling, peeling, pruning, and transportation methods, saving more than 4,500 laborers per month. In general, more detailed economic accounting has been carried out in the campaign to increase production and practice economy in various regions, and the actual cost in most provinces within the customs has been significantly lower than planned.

In order to further deepen the campaign to increase production and practice economy, strive to complete this year's timber production and submit tasks to the treasury, and ensure the completion of next year's production and capital construction tasks, the Central Ministry of Forestry is strengthening contact with the railway department and the timber-demanding departments to solve the problems of freight cars and goods lifting. It has also sent many cadres and work teams to various places to provide specific assistance and solve difficulties. At the beginning of December, it instructed various regions to take advantage of the favorable time for forest industry production, seize the main key to current production, organize forces, solve problems, and shift the focus of leadership of the campaign to increase production and practice economy to winter operations and procurement operations in a step-by-step and timely manner.

    许多林区提前完成全年木材生产任务
    全国森林工业系统开展增产节约运动以来，在加强计划管理、改进生产技术、提高劳动效率、减低成本等方面已获得显著成绩。根据不完全统计，已有湖南、江西、广东、安徽、浙江、福建、辽东和带岭、临江等森林工业局提前完成全年生产任务。预计今年全国可以超额完成生产任务。
    东北森林工业管理局由于减少了中间层次，推行了作业计划及调度制度，每天生产上发生的问题都能及时得到反映，并通过生产会议及时予以解决。如额穆、大石头、汪清、世环镇等森林工业局十月中旬发现枕资生产有完不成任务的危险，管理局通过调度电话使集材和运材两道工序紧密结合起来，结果十月份枕资任务超额完成。各地加强了职工的政治思想领导以后，在改进技术、提高劳动效率方面都有显著成绩。临江森林工业局工人创造了“归楞机”，大大减轻了重体力劳动，使每人每天归楞定额由七点四三立方公尺提高到十五立方公尺。双鸭山森林工业局森林铁路运输量由每天六百立方公尺提高到一千立方公尺。三岔子森林工业局平车运材过去一人放三台，推行翟凤殿先进小组试验的
  “一人放五车法”后，每天可节省四十三名放车工人和七十五名辅助工人的劳动。世环镇森林工业局用汽车运输十一万八千立方公尺木材到最后楞场，减少五道工序，节省了十七亿六千多万元。带岭森林工业实验局职工将积压二年多的两万立方公尺等外材进行简易加工后，使国家增加了十五亿八千多万元的纯收入。中南区在检尺中推行流水作业法，一般提高工作效率百分之五十。湖南洪江、江西吉安等地取消木材打水眼、改良招杆招壳（木排划水用的桨子），大大节约了木材。福建林区由于改进采伐、剥皮、打枝、运输等方法，提高劳动效率百分之十，每月节省劳动力四千五百多个。各地在增产节约运动中一般都进行了较细致的经济核算，关内大多数省份实际成本均比计划有显著降低。
    为了进一步深入地开展增产节约运动，争取完成今年木材生产及上缴财政任务，并保证明年生产及基本建设任务的完成，中央林业部一面与铁道部门和需材部门加强联系，以解决车皮、提货问题，一面又派出很多干部和工作组去各地具体帮助工作和解决困难。并在十二月初指示各地利用森林工业生产的有利时机，抓紧当前生产中主要关键，组织力量，解决问题，有步骤而又不失时宜地把增产节约运动的领导重点转移到冬季作业与收购作业方面来。
