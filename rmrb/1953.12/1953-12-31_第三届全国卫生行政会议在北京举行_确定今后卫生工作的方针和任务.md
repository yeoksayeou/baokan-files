The Third National Health Administration Conference was held in Beijing from December 24th to 28th.

At this conference, based on the general line and general task of the state during the transition period, a thorough examination was conducted of the shortcomings and errors of subjectivism, bureaucratism, and decentralism that existed in health work over the past four years, and the direction and tasks of future health work were discussed. This conference was convened on the basis of the anti-bureaucracy struggle carried out by the health departments since this spring, and it was a major inspection of ideology and policy, which will play an important role in improving future health work.

More than 190 people attended the conference, including the heads of all directly affiliated units of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, the Health Department of the General Logistics Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government, the health bureaus of major administrative regions and centrally administered municipalities across the country, and the health departments of various provinces.

At the opening of the conference, He Cheng, Vice Minister of Health of the Central People's Government, delivered a report entitled "Summary of Health Work in the Past Four Years and Future Directions and Tasks." He Cheng first pointed out that in the past four years, national health work has achieved great success in uniting health workers across the country, carrying out mass patriotic health movements, implementing medical prevention and medical education work, serving the restoration and development of the national economy, and supporting the great War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. In the process of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, a total of 131 volunteer medical surgery teams and health work teams were mobilized and organized to work at the front. Health work played a significant role in industrial, mining, forestry, water conservancy, road construction, and various basic construction projects, greatly reducing the incidence of disease among employees and ensuring the completion of production tasks. The patriotic health movement increased people's health knowledge, improved sanitary conditions, and defeated the bacteriological warfare of American imperialism. Due to the active implementation of epidemic prevention work, various highly infectious diseases have been brought under control. Maternal and child health work has greatly reduced the mortality rate of newborns and lying-in women, and a large number of midwives have been trained in various parts of the country over the past four years. Health undertakings in ethnic minority areas are gradually improving, with a total of more than 350 county health centers and more than 30 hospitals established, and more than 2,000 ethnic minority health cadres trained. In the past four years, the national health institutions have greatly developed. At present, the number of hospital beds in the country has increased more than four times compared with before liberation. Grassroots health organizations have gradually developed to the district and township levels. In terms of medical education, higher and secondary medical colleges and universities across the country have trained more than 60,000 senior and intermediate medical cadres. In the past four years, about 600,000 junior health workers have been trained. More than 20,000 people have graduated from traditional Chinese medicine refresher courses. Through the training and study of previous political movements, the political awareness of health workers across the country has been improved.

In his report, He Cheng also deeply criticized the shortcomings and errors that existed in health work over the past few years, and pointed out the serious harm of these errors to practical work. For example, there was insufficient understanding of the role that health work should play in the country's industrialization, and therefore, serious leadership was not actively carried out in industrial and mining health work, so that industrial and mining health work lagged far behind the needs of industrial production. Urban medical institutions and their work have not been effectively improved and rectified. In the development of county and district health care institutions, there were serious phenomena such as blind development, formalism, and coercion in epidemic prevention work and the patriotic health movement. Many hospitals' unreasonable systems have not been thoroughly reformed, the phenomenon of chaos in hospitals is still very serious, and the bed turnover rate is very low. There is a lack of a comprehensive understanding of traditional Chinese medicine, and excessive emphasis is placed on the shortcomings of traditional Chinese medicine, so the work of uniting and improving traditional Chinese medicine has not been done well enough, so that the power of traditional Chinese medicine cannot be fully exerted. The main shortcomings in the leadership of health departments are weak political leadership, serious non-political views, and a tendency to ignore the leadership and supervision of the Party. This reflects that bourgeois ideology exists seriously in the health departments.

After explaining in detail the future tasks of health work, He Cheng pointed out that health departments at all levels should strengthen the system of asking for instructions and reporting to Party committees and governments at all levels in the future, implement the principle of collective leadership, promote democracy, carry out criticism and self-criticism; strengthen the political and ideological leadership of health departments, organize all medical staff to conscientiously carry out theoretical and political study, so as to improve the level of political ideology and serve the people wholeheartedly; establish a practical, simple, realistic, and close contact with the masses of work style, and oppose bureaucratism, subjectivism, and decentralism.

Through group discussions and plenary speeches, the conference unfolded criticism and self-criticism from bottom to top, exposed and criticized various errors, and discussed future directions and tasks.

Regarding the direction and tasks of future health work, the conference held that the basic task of health work is to promote the health of the people and serve the country's economic construction and national defense construction. Future health work must better serve the realization of the general line. The current focus of work is: to strengthen industrial and mining health and urban medical work, to closely combine rural health work with the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and to continue to carry out the patriotic health movement to prevent and control diseases that are most harmful to the people. In order to complete these tasks, it is necessary to vigorously train cadres, rely on the masses, unite and improve all medical staff; implement the policy of "rectification and consolidation, focusing on development, improving quality, and advancing steadily"; and resolutely oppose subjectivism, bureaucratism, and decentralism.

The conference discussed various tasks such as industrial and mining health, urban medical care, continuing to carry out the patriotic health movement, traditional Chinese medicine work, medical education and research work, maternal and child health, and health work in ethnic minority areas, and made clear regulations.

On the last day of the conference, Xi Zhongxun, Deputy Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government, made an important report. In addition to affirming the achievements of health work in the past four years and pointing out the serious shortcomings and errors that exist in health work, he also made important instructions on the current direction and tasks of health work and how to strengthen leadership and improve work style. Finally, he called on all health workers to unite and strive to complete the major tasks of health work.

    第三届全国卫生行政会议在北京举行
    确定今后卫生工作的方针和任务
    第三届全国卫生行政会议自十二月二十四日到二十八日在北京举行。
    这次会议，根据国家在过渡时期的总路线和总任务，深入检查了四年来卫生工作中所存在的主观主义、官僚主义和分散主义的缺点和错误，讨论了今后卫生工作的方针任务。这次会议是在今春以来卫生部门进行反官僚主义斗争的基础上召开的，是一次思想、政策的大检查，对改进今后卫生工作将起重要的作用。
    出席会议的有：中央人民政府卫生部各直属单位、中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总后方勤务部卫生部、全国各大行政区和中央直辖市卫生局、各省卫生厅的负责人共一百九十多人。
    会议开幕时，中央人民政府卫生部副部长贺诚作了“四年来卫生工作的总结和今后的方针任务”的报告。贺诚首先指出，四年来，全国卫生工作，在团结全国卫生人员，开展群众性的爱国卫生运动、实施医疗预防和医学教育工作，为国家经济的恢复和发展服务，并支援伟大的抗美援朝斗争，获得了很大成绩。在抗美援朝的过程中，全国先后动员和组织到前方工作的志愿医疗手术队和卫生工作队有一百三十一个。在工矿、林业和水利、筑路及各项基本建设工程中，卫生工作发挥了重大的作用，使职工发病率大大减少，保证了生产任务的完成。爱国卫生运动增加了人民的卫生知识，改善了卫生状况，战胜了美国帝国主义的细菌战。由于积极地进行了防疫工作，使各种烈性传染病得到控制。妇幼卫生工作，使初生儿和产妇的死亡率大为降低，全国各地四年来训练了大量的接生员。少数民族地区的卫生事业正逐步改善，共建立了三百五十多个县卫生院和三十多个医院，培养了两千多名少数民族卫生干部。四年来，全国的卫生机构有了很大的发展。目前全国的病床数较解放前增加了四倍多。基层卫生组织已逐渐发展到区、乡。在医学教育方面，全国各高等和中等医学院校已培养出六万多名高、中级医务干部。四年来，并训练了约六十万名初级卫生工作人员。中医进修已有二万多人毕业。全国卫生工作人员经过历次政治运动的锻炼和学习，政治觉悟已有所提高。
    贺诚在报告中对几年来卫生工作中所存在的缺点和错误也进行了深刻的批判，并指出这些错误对实际工作的严重危害。如对卫生工作在国家工业化中应起的作用认识不足，因而没有积极地对工矿卫生工作进行认真的领导，以致工矿卫生工作远远落后于工业生产的需要。对城市医疗机构及其工作没有切实地加以改善和整顿。在发展县、区卫生医疗机构方面，在防疫工作和爱国卫生运动中，存在着盲目发展、形式主义、强迫命令等严重现象。许多医院不合理的制度，尚未彻底改革，医院中的忙乱现象还十分严重，病床周转率很低。对中医缺乏全面的认识，过分强调中医的缺点，因而对中医的团结和提高的工作做得不够，使中医的力量不能充分发挥。卫生部门领导工作中的主要缺点是政治领导薄弱，有严重的非政治观点和有忽视党的领导与监督的偏向。这都反映出资产阶级思想在卫生部门中是严重地存在着。
    贺诚在详尽地阐明了卫生工作今后的任务后指出：各级卫生部门今后应加强向各级党委和政府的请示报告制度，贯彻集体领导的原则，发扬民主，开展批评与自我批评；加强卫生部门的政治思想领导，组织全体医务人员认真地进行理论和政治学习，以提高政治思想水平，全心全意地为人民服务；树立切实朴素、实事求是、密切联系群众的工作作风，反对官僚主义、主观主义和分散主义。
    会议经过小组讨论和大会发言，自下而上地展开了批评和自我批评，揭发和批判了各种错误，并讨论了今后的方针任务。
    关于今后卫生工作的方针任务，会议认为：卫生工作的基本任务是增进人民的健康，为国家的经济建设和国防建设服务。今后卫生工作必须更好地为实现总路线服务。目前工作的重点是：要加强工矿卫生和城市医疗工作，使农村卫生工作和互助合作运动密切结合，并继续开展爱国卫生运动，防治对人民危害性最大的疾病。为了完成这些任务，必须大力培养干部，依靠群众，团结和提高一切医务人员；贯彻“整顿巩固、重点发展、提高质量、稳步前进”的方针；并坚决反对主观主义、官僚主义和分散主义。
    会议对于工矿卫生、城市医疗、继续开展爱国卫生运动、中医工作、医学教育和研究工作、妇幼卫生、少数民族地区的卫生工作等各项工作都进行了讨论，并作出了明确的规定。
    会议最后一天，由中央人民政府政务院文化教育委员会副主任习仲勋作了重要报告。他在报告中除肯定了四年来卫生工作的成绩和指出卫生工作中所存在的严重缺点和错误外，并对当前卫生工作的方针任务以及如何加强领导和改进作风等问题作了重要指示。最后，他号召全体卫生工作人员团结起来，为完成卫生工作的重大任务而奋斗。
