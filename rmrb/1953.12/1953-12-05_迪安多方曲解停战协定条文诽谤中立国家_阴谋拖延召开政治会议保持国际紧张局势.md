Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 3rd: This reporter, Jiang Nan, reports: The Korean-Chinese side today warned Dean that if the US side does not stop its delaying tactics, it must bear full responsibility for delaying the convening of the political conference.

    In today's meeting between the two sides on the issue of the political conference, Dean continued to waste time with lengthy and meaningless speeches. In his speech, Dean continued to slander the Soviet Union, demanding "an exchange of mixed lists of formal participants arranged in alphabetical order, with the Soviet Union included on the list without specifying that the Soviet Union is on your side," but in reality still wanting to include the Soviet Union as one of the parties to the Korean Armistice Agreement. He attempted to peddle his trick of opposing the Soviet Union as a neutral country by this method. The Korean-Chinese side immediately rejected this on the spot.

    Since the Korean-Chinese side refuted all of Dean's arguments against the Soviet Union as a neutral country by citing Article 37 of the Armistice Agreement regarding the definition of a neutral country, namely: "Countries that have not participated in hostile actions in Korea with combat troops," Dean attempted to abandon this definition. He said: "Let us not talk about your empty formalities and definitions." But he himself distorted the history of Article 37 of the Armistice Agreement, attempting to use the absence of the Soviet Union in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to prove that the Soviet Union is not a neutral country.

    Dean's attitude not only shows his contempt for the solemn Armistice Agreement, but also proves his extreme ignorance of the Korean armistice negotiations. The fact is: the definition of a neutral country in Article 37 of the Armistice Agreement, which Dean is trying so hard to avoid, was not put forward by the Korean-Chinese side, but by the US side itself. At the beginning of 1952, when the two sides held staff meetings to discuss the draft Armistice Agreement, Article 38 of the draft agreement originally proposed by the US side stipulated that the definition of a so-called neutral country was "a country that has not participated in hostile actions in Korea with combat troops." The US side put forward such a definition at the time because Norway and Sweden, among the neutral countries nominated by the US side to participate in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, had dispatched medical units and ships to help the US troops invading Korea. Now, in order to oppose the Soviet Union as a neutral country participating in the political conference, the US side does not even want the definition it put forward itself.

    Dean's distortion of the history of Article 37 of the Armistice Agreement to oppose the Soviet Union as a neutral country is even more unreasonable. Throughout the armistice negotiations, the Korean-Chinese side consistently insisted that the Soviet Union should participate in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. The US side, like now, used stubborn opposition to the Soviet Union as a neutral country to delay the armistice negotiations. All the absurd arguments put forward by the US side at that time had been refuted so thoroughly by the Korean-Chinese side that the US side could only resort to rogue tactics, stubbornly saying: "This is our unilateral reason and cannot be discussed." Later, in order to achieve an early realization of the Korean armistice, the Korean-Chinese side made a major concession and agreed to Poland, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, and Sweden as members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, but always insisted that the Soviet Union was a neutral country. Dean is now stealing a few punches from his predecessor in the negotiations, Joye, and taking those arguments that were worthless as early as February and March last year to the political conference to peddle. This shows that Dean is determined to follow the old path of Joye and Harrison, turning the current talks between the two sides into a second protracted Panmunjom negotiation.

    Dean today made no secret of this attempt. He threatened the Korean-Chinese side, saying that if the Korean-Chinese side insisted on the Soviet Union participating in the political conference as a neutral country, he would make the issue of convening the political conference "indefinitely and perhaps forever" delayed.

    It is quite obvious that Dean's stubborn opposition to the Soviet Union participating in the political conference as a neutral country is not only to make the talks between the two sides an "endless debate," as he said, to delay the convening of the political conference indefinitely, but also to attempt to turn the talks between the two sides into a place for conducting "Cold War" propaganda, in order to achieve the US determination to continue maintaining international tension.

### 迪安多方曲解停战协定条文诽谤中立国家  阴谋拖延召开政治会议保持国际紧张局势

    迪安多方曲解停战协定条文诽谤中立国家
    阴谋拖延召开政治会议保持国际紧张局势
    【新华社开城三日电】本社特派记者江南报道：朝中方面今天警告迪安，如果美方不停止它的拖延手段，它必须担负延迟召开政治会议的完全责任。
    在今天的关于政治会议问题的双方会谈中，迪安继续用长篇大论的无意义的发言来消磨时间。迪安在他的发言中继续对苏联进行诽谤，要求“交换按字母次序排列的正式参加者的混合名单，将苏联列入名单内，而不指明苏联与你们列为一方”，但实际上则仍然要将苏联作为朝鲜停战协定缔约双方中的一方。他企图用这种办法来兜售他的反对苏联作为中立国的诡计。朝中方面当场就加以拒绝。
    由于朝中方面引用停战协定第三十七款中关于中立国的定义，即：“未有战斗部队参加在朝鲜的敌对行为的国家”，驳倒了迪安反对苏联作为中立国的一切论据，因此迪安企图抛开这条定义不谈。他说：“让我们不谈你们的空洞的形式和定义吧。”可是他自己却歪曲停战协定第三十七款的历史，企图用中立国监察委员会中没有苏联来证明苏联不是中立国。
    迪安这种态度不但表现了他轻视庄严的停战协定，而且证明他对于朝鲜停战谈判极端无知。事实是：迪安所竭力企图避而不谈的停战协定第三十七款中关于中立国的定义，并不是朝中方面提出来的，而是美方自己提出来的。在一九五二年初双方举行参谋会议讨论停战协定草案的时候，美方原提出的协定草案第三十八款就规定：所谓中立国家的定义就是“未有战斗部队参加在朝鲜的敌对行为的国家”。美方当时所以提出这样一条定义，是因为当时美方提名参加中立国监察委员会的中立国中的挪威和瑞典，都曾为美国的侵朝军队派遣了医疗单位和船只之类的帮助。现在美方为了反对苏联作为中立国参加政治会议，却居然连自己提出的定义都不要了。
    迪安曲解停战协定第三十七款的历史来反对苏联作为中立国，更是毫无道理。在停战谈判过程中，朝中方面始终坚持苏联应该参加中立国监察委员会。美方当时也像现在一样，用顽固地反对苏联作为中立国来拖延停战谈判。当时美方提出的一切荒谬论据都已经被朝中方面驳斥得体无完肤，使得美方最后只能耍出无赖手段，蛮横地说：“这是我方单方面的理由，不能加以讨论。”后来朝中方面为了使朝鲜停战得以早日实现，作了重大的让步，同意以波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、瑞士、瑞典为中立国监察委员会的委员，但是始终坚持苏联是中立国。迪安现在从当时的谈判代表乔埃那里偷来几下拳头，把早在去年二、三月间就已经一文不值的那些论据，拿到政治会议上来卖弄。这说明了迪安决心要走乔埃和哈利逊的老路，把目前的双方会谈变为第二个旷日持久的板门店谈判。
    迪安今天毫不掩饰地表明了他这种企图。他恐吓朝中方面说，如果朝中方面坚持苏联作为中立国参加政治会议，他就要使召开政治会议的问题“无限期地而且也许是永远地”拖延下去。
    十分明显，迪安顽固地反对苏联作为中立国参加政治会议，不但是为了使双方会谈成为如他所说的“无休止的辩论会”，使政治会议的召开无限期拖延下去，而且是企图将双方会谈变成进行“冷战”宣传的场所，以便达到美国决心要继续保持国际紧张局势的目的。
