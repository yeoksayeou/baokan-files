Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 12th: Today, the explanation work for the POWs at Songgok-ri by the US side did not proceed. Because the South Korean POWs' demand to guarantee that their right to be briefed would not be arbitrarily obstructed was stubbornly rejected by the US side, the South Korean POWs were unwilling to leave the camp.

After meeting with the POWs, General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, had to admit: "It is not that the POWs want to halt the explanation work; they are willing to listen to the explanation, but they are simply demanding clarification on the issue of their repatriation," while the US-ROK explanation representatives were unwilling to grant them the right to listen to the explanation fully.

In the past nine days, more than two hundred South Korean POWs have listened to the explanation, and none has requested repatriation. At the beginning of the explanation, Syngman Rhee's explanation personnel said that 15 percent of the 328 South Korean POWs in Songgok-ri would request to return to South Korea.

The Geneva Convention on POWs stipulates that all POWs should be repatriated after the cessation of hostilities. The Korean-Chinese side, in accordance with this provision, has repeatedly persuaded South Korean and American-British POWs to return home to live peaceful lives.

The Korean-Chinese side has built facilities to isolate the POWs from the explanation personnel. However, because all the POWs who have listened to the explanation do not request repatriation, the number has exceeded the capacity of the isolation camp, and the Indian custodial forces have had to move these POWs who have listened to the explanation back to their original camp and exchange the South Korean POWs who have not listened to the explanation to the camp originally intended for isolation.

For nine days, the POWs listening to the explanation in Songgok-ri have been very quiet and well-behaved. They calmly walk into the explanation tents, unlike the POWs in Dongchang-ri who look around warily due to the threat of secret agents; they listen to the explanation quietly, sometimes taking out pens to write something on paper, unlike the POWs in Dongchang-ri who are forced by secret agents to plug their ears or shout loudly in advance. Many South Korean POWs also bring the "Terms of Reference" and "Working Procedures" to the tents, demanding that the explanation personnel provide full explanations and clarify issues related to their repatriation, as well as explain all the rights granted to them by the armistice agreement, unlike the POWs in Dongchang-ri who are completely ignorant of the "Terms of Reference" and "Working Procedures."

However, the Syngman Rhee explanation personnel, who have been trained by the Americans for a long time, apart from fiddling with their American tape recorders, propaganda documents, photos, and gold watches, have become annoyed and irritable since the second day. They declare "explanation ended" after reading the "documents"; some explanation personnel do not even read the "documents," play the tape recorder for a while, look at the POWs' appearances, and then ask the chairman of the subsidiary body of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to take them away. POWs are brought into the tent one after another and quickly taken out of the tent one after another. And when the POWs ask the explanation personnel to tell them what they should know about repatriation, the Syngman Rhee explanation personnel withdraw from the meeting or force the chairman of the subsidiary body to use force to drive the POWs out of the tent.

In the nine days of explanation, the Syngman Rhee explanation personnel not only despise the rights of the POWs and refuse to explain, but also arbitrarily insult and threaten the POWs. They boredly scold the POWs as "sons of bitches" and "little bastards," telling the POWs to "get out!" They threaten the POWs, saying: "If you don't go back, you will be captured by the Republic of Korea Army again in the future!" "You can get freedom by going out from the south gate, and you will be prisoners forever by going out from the north gate!" This is a blatant violation of the provision of Article 1, paragraph 3 of the "Terms of Reference," which states, "Violence shall not be inflicted on the person of prisoners of war, nor shall their dignity or self-respect be insulted in any way or for any purpose." In Dongchang-ri, the Rhee-Chiang secret agents hide knives, stones, and disinfectant powder on their bodies and bring them into the explanation tents, using them to threaten and injure the explanation representatives, interrupting and terminating the explanation. Because the Rhee-Chiang secret agents prevent the POWs from listening to the explanation, the explanation work of the Korean-Chinese side has been interrupted five times, and the last interruption has continued for twenty-six days now.

### 美方不肯给南朝鲜战俘听取解释的权利  十二日美李方面的解释工作没有进行

    美方不肯给南朝鲜战俘听取解释的权利
    十二日美李方面的解释工作没有进行
    【新华社开城十二日电】今天，美方对松谷里战俘的解释工作没有进行。由于南朝鲜战俘所提保证他们听取解释的权利不受任意阻挠的要求，被美方所顽固地拒绝，因此南朝鲜战俘们不愿走出营场。
    中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军在会见了战俘们之后，不得不承认：“并不是战俘们想使解释工作停顿，他们是愿意听解释的，但他们就是要求澄清有关他们遣返的问题”，而美李的解释代表不肯给予他们以充分听取解释的权利。
    过去九天中，听取过解释的南朝鲜战俘已有二百多人，没有一个要求遣返。在解释开始的时候，李承晚的解释人员曾说，松谷里的三百二十八名南朝鲜战俘中将有百分之十五要求回到南朝鲜。
    日内瓦战俘公约规定在敌对行为终止后，应遣返全部战俘。朝中方面遵照这个规定，曾多次劝说南朝鲜和英美战俘回家过和平生活。
    朝中方面为解释者一方修建了隔离战俘的设备。但是，由于听过解释的战俘全部不要求遣返，以致人数超过了隔离营场的容量，印度看管部队不得不把这些听过解释的战俘移回到原来的营场，而把没有听解释的南朝鲜战俘调换到原来是供隔离用的营场。
    九天来，松谷里听解释的战俘都是十分安静和守规矩的。他们镇静地走进解释帐篷，不像东场里的战俘那样由于特务威胁而东张西望，左顾右盼；他们静静地听解释，有时拿出钢笔来在纸上记些什么，不像东场里的战俘那样被特务事先迫令用手塞住耳朵或者大声叫嚷。有许多南朝鲜战俘还带着“职权范围”和“工作细则”到帐篷中来，他们要求解释人员进行充分的解释，并要求澄清有关他们遣返的问题，以及说明停战协定赋予他们的一切权利，不像东场里的战俘那样对“职权范围”和“工作细则”毫无所知。
    但是，经过美国人长期训练的李承晚解释人员除了摆弄他们的美国录音机、宣传性的文告、照片、金表以外，从第二天起就变得厌烦和暴躁起来。他们念完“文告”就宣告“解释结束了”；有的解释人员甚至连“文告”也不念，放了一阵录音机，用眼睛看看战俘的模样便要求中立国遣返委员会附属机构主席把他带走。战俘一个接一个地被带进帐篷来，又很快地一个接着一个被带出帐篷去。而当战俘要求解释人员告诉他们所应该知道的与遣返有关的事情时，李承晚解释人员便退出会场，或迫使附属机构主席使用武力把战俘撵出帐篷。
    在九天的解释中，李承晚解释人员不仅蔑视战俘权利，拒绝解释，而且还肆意辱骂和威胁战俘。他们无聊地辱骂战俘是“婊子养的”、“小崽子”，叫战俘“滚出去！”他们恐吓战俘说：“如果不回去，将来又要被大韩民国军俘掳！”“从南面的门出去可得自由，从北面的门出去将永远当俘虏！”这是公然破坏“职权范围”第一条第三款“不得允许以任何方式或为任何目的，对战俘人身施以暴力或侮辱其尊严或自尊”的规定。而在东场里，李蒋特务则把刀子、石块、消毒粉藏在身上带进解释帐篷，用来威胁和伤害解释代表，打断和终止解释。由于李蒋特务阻止战俘听解释，朝中方面的解释工作已中断了五次，最后一次中断到现在已继续了二十六天。
