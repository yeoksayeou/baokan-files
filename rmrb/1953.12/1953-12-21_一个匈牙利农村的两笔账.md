From Hungary, Gé Liénàtè

In a small village called Öreglak in Somogy County, Hungary, the crops have already been harvested. This village was the first in the entire region to complete the harvesting work. Seeing the abundant harvest, people are even more motivated to work. Because threshing has started everywhere, people are talking about the price of grain and how much each person will earn.

Those who truly put effort into farming have had a good harvest this year. The people of Öreglak village are diligent and familiar with farming techniques. For example, the individual farmer Ágoston Antal, who cultivates ten holds (one hold equals 8.55 Chinese mu), can harvest an average of 1,200 kilograms of grain per hold.

The "Young Guard" Agricultural Production Cooperative has an even better harvest, with the best corn, beets, potatoes, and grains in the entire region. Based on the threshing results, the cooperative will yield no less than 1,500 kilograms of grain per hold. After paying the state and storing seeds, each member will receive a good income. One work-day unit will earn at least six kilograms of grain, not counting income from corn, potatoes, beets, other industrial crops, and animal products. Now, cooperative members are constantly calculating how much grain they will net per work-day unit.

Let's take a look at Ágoston's accounts. He is a respected middle peasant in the village, and the villagers often seek his advice on farming. He and his family of five work hard day and night on his ten holds of land. This year, he planted rye on three and a half holds. He has already calculated how much he can earn this year after paying quotas, threshing expenses, and setting aside seeds. Here are his accounts:

Total grain harvest 4,200 kilograms
　　　Paid to the state 1,450 kilograms
　　　Threshing expenses 420 kilograms
　　　Stored for seeds 350 kilograms
Total expenditures 2,220 kilograms
Personal income 1,980 kilograms

According to the accounts, Ágoston's family can still get 1,980 kilograms of grain after deducting all expenses.

Let's look at the accounts of a member of the agricultural production cooperative. Horváth László, his wife, and son all work and are respected in the cooperative. Usually, they never easily miss a day of work. Here are Horváth's accounts:

Work-day units earned 600
Grain distributed 3,600 kilograms
　　　Paid to the state None
　　　Threshing fees None
　　　Stored for seeds None
Personal income 3,600 kilograms

Therefore, Horváth László nets 3,600 kilograms of grain, which he can dispose of freely without any expenses. In the cooperative, the grain paid to the state is managed centrally, and threshing fees and seeds are allocated from public revenue. The remaining grain is distributed to members according to work-day units. Horváth, a member of the "Young Guard" Agricultural Production Cooperative, earns more than a middle peasant with ten holds of land. In one year, Horváth's family of three earns almost as much grain as the total income of the middle peasant Ágoston, but their actual income is higher than Ágoston's. Déri József and Binder István's incomes are also comparable to Horváth's. The Déri family completed a total of 580 work-day units, equivalent to 3,480 kilograms of grain. Aunt Kolár, a widow, is one of the most diligent female members, and she completed 240 work-day units. She will receive 1,440 kilograms of grain from the cooperative, which is enough for a family of three to eat. We are only talking about grain, but cooperative farmers will also receive a lot of corn, sugar, and other agricultural products, in quantities much greater than any individual farmer.

These achievements are by no means from the sky. Cooperative members must work hard and learn the methods of large-scale collective farming on hundreds of holds of land. Last year and this year, the fields of the "Young Guard" Agricultural Production Cooperative have been cultivated using advanced methods. Last year, they plowed the land deeply with tractors, and the seeds were sown in furrows twenty-two centimeters deep. Fertilizers were applied in both spring and autumn, and the machine tractor station greatly helped them with spring plowing. With these many conditions, Ágoston's land only yields 1,200 kilograms of wheat per hold, while the cooperative's harvest averages 1,500 kilograms.

The production methods of the individual farmer Ágoston and the cooperative members also differ in other aspects. For example, in terms of labor productivity, the cooperative uses less manpower to plant wheat, rye, barley, corn, and other industrial crops than Ágoston uses on his land. The cooperative also spends less time planting one hold of wheat than Ágoston spends. In the cooperative, plowing, threshing, and removing rice stubble are mechanized; sowing and cultivating are done with horsepower, and only harvesting is done manually.

Let us illustrate this with numbers:

Labor used by the cooperative to plant one hold
　　　Manual labor 6 work-days
　　　Double horse team 1.5 work-days
　　　Machines 0.1 work-days
　　　Harvest 1,500 kilograms of wheat

Labor used by Ágoston to plant one hold of land
　　　Manual labor 8.7 work-days
　　　Double horse team 3.5 work-days
　　　Machines 0.1 work-days
　　　Harvest 1,200 kilograms of wheat

These figures show that the "Young Guard" Agricultural Production Cooperative uses 2.7 fewer work-days in manual labor and two fewer days for the double horse team in planting wheat on one hold of land. This can save a lot of time. The amount saved on one hold of land is not much, but if it is on one hundred holds of land, it can save two hundred and seventy people one day of work and two hundred pairs of horses one day of labor, which is considerable. Next year, the cooperative also plans to use more machines. In wheat planting, only weeding and part of the harvesting work will require horsepower and manpower. It is much more effective to use machines on the cooperative's land because it is not hindered by field boundaries.

The "Young Guard" Agricultural Production Cooperative not only grows crops better than individual households, but also feeds livestock better than others. Although the cooperative is still a beginner in modern animal husbandry, the progress in this area has been very good since the establishment of the cooperative two years ago. The cooperative's public livestock includes forty-five cows, one hundred and eighteen pigs (including twenty sows), twenty-four horses, and hundreds of poultry. Comparing the milk production of the cows raised by the cooperative with the cows raised by Ágoston can show how different the two methods are.

"Young Guard" Agricultural Production Cooperative Number of dairy cows 21
　　　Total milk production 37,800 liters
　　　Sales and other expenses (feeding calves) 15,424 liters
　　　Sold in the market 22,376 liters
　　　Amount distributed per member (total 45 members)
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　497 liters

Looking at Ágoston's situation:
　　　Number of dairy cows 2
　　　Total milk production 3,200 liters
　　　Sales and other expenses 2,116 liters
　　　Sales 1,084 liters
　　　Each of the five family laborers gets 216 liters

In other words, Horváth's family of three, members of the "Young Guard" Agricultural Production Cooperative, receive a total of 1,491 liters of milk, while Ágoston's family of five only has 1,084 liters of milk.

Cooperative pig farming and annual meat production:
　　　Number of pigs 44
　　　Total weight 5,720 kilograms
　　　Paid to the state 900 kilograms
　　　Sold 4,820 kilograms
　　　Each member receives 100 kilograms

Ágoston's family's income from pig farming is as follows:
　　　Number of pigs 2
　　　Total weight 260 kilograms
　　　Paid to the state 83 kilograms
　　　Sold 177 kilograms
　　　Each laborer receives 35 kilograms

Therefore, it is clear from the livestock farming aspect that there is a difference between the income of the cooperative members and Ágoston. In the cooperative, large-scale animal husbandry is constantly improving. The energy of the people who raise livestock is only focused on taking care of the livestock, and they do not have to be distracted by other things. The cattle ranchers are only responsible for feeding fodder, watering, milking, and keeping the cattle clean. The pig farmers take care of the sows, large pigs, and piglets. In specialized work, they gradually become familiar with advanced methods of livestock farming and become skilled workers in their industry. There is no doubt that individual farmers have also accumulated some knowledge in feeding livestock, but constantly improving by specializing in one job is different after all. Ihász has two years of experience feeding cattle in the cooperative, and Vámos has been feeding pigs for a long time. They do a good job, and their skills and experience are very useful to the cooperative. The income from selling milk in the free market alone is four to five thousand forints (Hungarian currency) per month. When the breeders do a good job, not only does the cooperative make a profit, but their own income also increases.

In addition to working in the cooperative, members also have a piece of land of their own, with one cow, one sow and several pigs, and fifteen to twenty chickens per household. The benefits from this are also considerable. The production from one-half or three-quarters of a hold of land can cover a large expense for cooperative farmers. For example, cooperative member Péter's own land produced 1,200 kilograms of corn last year, and he used this corn to fatten a large pig and several other livestock. Cooperative member Venczel privately raises a cow that produces fifteen liters of milk a day. The milk they cannot finish drinking at home is taken to the market to sell, and sometimes it is made into cheese and butter to sell.

From these facts, it is easy to understand why the members of the "Young Guard" Agricultural Production Cooperative have such confidence. A few years ago, they were alone in dealing with all the difficulties of life. Today, all the problems are solved jointly by the forty-five cooperative members. Since they organized the cooperative and started collective farming, their way of life has undergone fundamental changes. Now, the Venczel family has built a new house, and he recently bought furniture and a radio. He plans to buy a bicycle next spring. After settling accounts last year, the Villers family made new clothes for the whole family. When his daughter got married, he also bought 6,000 forints of furniture as a dowry.

However, the benefits that the members of the Agricultural Production Cooperative get from collective farming are not just income. Their cultural demands have also risen. During the winter slack season, they go to listen to lectures on growing crops and raising livestock, and go to the cooperative's library to read newspapers and books. The chairman of the cooperative, Illés, is planning to go to a specialized school because the practical experience he has gained on his own nine holds of land is not enough to manage the cooperative's hundreds of holds of land. The cooperative desperately needs technically trained people.

None of the members of the "Young Guard" Agricultural Production Cooperative want to withdraw from the cooperative. Collective work and abundant harvests have firmly united them.

    一个匈牙利农村的两笔账
    匈牙利  格·列纳特
    在匈牙利绍莫吉州一个叫厄勒格拉克的小村庄里，庄稼已经收割完了。这个村在全区里是最早完成收割工作的。眼看着作物都是丰收，人们工作的劲头更大了。因为各处都开始了打谷，人们就谈起谷子的价钱如何，每一个人的收入多少。
    只要真正出力耕种的人今年都有好收成。厄勒格拉克村的人都是勤谨的人，并且都熟悉种地的技术。例如单干户阿格斯顿·安托尔种着十霍尔德
  （一霍尔德等于八·五五市亩）土地，他每霍尔德平均可以打谷一千二百公斤。
    “青年近卫军”农业生产合作社的收成更好，它的玉蜀黍、甜菜、马铃薯和谷子都是全区最好的。从打谷的成绩来看，合作社每霍尔德的谷子将不少于一千五百公斤。除去交纳给国家和存下种子，每一个社员将得到很好的收入。一个劳动日单位至少可得到六公斤谷子，还有玉蜀黍、马铃薯、甜菜、其他工业作物和畜产品的收入不计算在内。现在，合作社社员时常在算他们每一个劳动日单位净收的谷子到底是多少。
    让我们来看看阿格斯顿的账。他在村里是一位有声望的中农，老乡们常常来找他请教种地的事。他和他家里五口人都起早摸黑地耕种着他的十霍尔德土地。今年他拿三个半霍尔德的土地种裸麦。他已经算出来今年除了交纳定额、打谷子的开销和留下种子之外，他自己可以收入多少东西。下面就是他的账：
    全部收成谷子　四千二百公斤
        交纳一千四百五十公斤
        打谷费用四百二十公斤
        储存种子三百五十公斤
    全部支出二千二百二十公斤
    个人收入一千九百八十公斤
    从账上看，阿格斯顿家把一切开销除掉后，还可以得到一千九百八十公斤谷子。
    让我们看看农业生产合作社社员的账。何瓦特·拉斯洛和老婆儿子三个人都工作，在合作社中，他们受到大家的尊敬。平常他们从来不轻易耽误一天工作。下面是何瓦特的账：
    所做劳动日单位　六百个
    分得谷子　三千六百公斤
        交纳　无
        打谷费　无
        储存种子　无
    个人收入三千六百公斤
    所以，何瓦特·拉斯洛净挣三千六百公斤谷子，他可以随便处置，不要交付任何开支。在合作社里，交纳给国家的粮食是统筹办理的，打谷费和谷种都由公共收入中拨出来。其余的粮食就按劳动日单位来分给社员。“青年近卫军”农业生产合作社社员何瓦特的收入比一个有着十霍尔德土地的中农还要多。在一年中，何瓦特的三口之家所挣得的谷子几乎和中农阿格斯顿的总收入一样多，但他们的实际收入比阿格斯顿的高。德里·约瑟夫和宾德尔·伊斯特万的收入也和何瓦特的不相上下。德里一家共做了五百八十个劳动日单位，合三千四百八十公斤谷子。寡妇柯拉尔大娘在女社员中要算最勤勉的，她做了二百四十个劳动日单位，她将从合作社得到一千四百四十公斤谷子，这足够一个三口之家食用了。我们只说到谷子，但合作社农民还要得到很多玉蜀黍、糖和其他农产品，数量比任何单干农民要多得多。
    这种成绩决不是从天上落下来的。合作社社员必须辛勤地工作，必须学习在几百霍尔德面积的土地上大规模集体耕种的方法。去年和今年，“青年近卫军”农业生产合作社的田地都是用先进方法来耕种。去年他们用拖拉机把地耕深了，种子播在二十二公分深的犁沟里。在春秋二季都施肥，机器拖拉机站大力帮助他们春耕。有了这许多条件，所以阿格斯顿的土地每霍尔德只收一千二百公斤小麦，而合作社的收成却平均是一千五百公斤。
    单干的阿格斯顿和合作社社员的生产方法在其他方面也不相同。譬如说劳动生产率的问题，合作社栽种小麦、裸麦、大麦、玉米和别的工业作物所用的人力比阿格斯顿在他的土地上所用的少。种一霍尔德地的小麦，合作社所费工作时间也比阿格斯顿所用的时间少。在合作社里，耕地、打谷和拔除稻桩都机械化了；播种和耕耘是用马力，只有收割用人力。
    让我们用数目字来说明这个问题：
    合作社种一霍尔德所用的劳力
    人工　六个工作日
    双马工作队　一·五工作日
    机器　○·一工作日
    收成　一千五百公斤小麦
    阿格斯顿种一霍尔德地所用的劳力
    人工　八·七工作日
    双马工作队　三·五工作日
    机器　○·一工作日
    收成　一千二百公斤小麦
    这些数字说明了“青年近卫军”农业生产合作社在一霍尔德地上栽种小麦，在人工方面少用二·七个工作日，双马工作队的时间少用两天。这样就可以节省很多时间。在一个霍尔德土地上所能节省的数目不多，但是假如在一百霍尔德的土地上，就能够节省二百七十个人一天的工作及二百对马一天的劳动，这就很可观了。明年合作社还打算多用机器。在种小麦方面，只有除草和一部分收割工作要用马力和人力。在合作社的土地上用机器要有效得多，因为不必受阡陌的阻碍了。
      “青年近卫军”农业生产合作社不单是种庄稼比单干户强，合作社里的牲口也喂得比别人好。尽管合作社对于现代牧畜的知识还是初学，但自从建社两年以来，这方面的进步已经很不错了。社里公有的牲畜包括四十五头牛、一百一十八口猪（其中有二十口母猪）、二十四匹马和几百只家禽。试拿合作社所养的牛和阿格斯顿的牛的产奶量来比较，就可以知道两种方法是怎样的不同。
      “青年近卫军”农业生产合作社奶牛头数二一
    产奶量共计三七、八○○公升
    交售及其他支出（喂小牛）一五、四二四公升
    在市场出售　二二、三七六公升
    每一社员分得量（共四十五个社员）
                                  四九七公升
    再看阿格斯顿的情形：
    奶牛头数　二
    产奶量共计　三、二○○公升
    交售及其他支出　二、一一六公升
    出售　一、○八四公升
    全家劳动力五人各得　二一六公升
    换句话说，“青年近卫军”农业生产合作社社员何瓦特家三口人一共分得一、四九一公升牛奶，单干户阿格斯顿家五口人一共才有一、○八四公升牛奶。
    合作社养猪及全年产肉量：
    猪的口数　四四
    重量共计　五、七二○公斤
    交售　九○○公斤
    出售四、八二○公斤
    每个社员分得　一○○公斤阿格斯顿家养猪的收益如下：
    猪的口数　二
    重量共计　二六○公斤
    交售　八三公斤
    出售　一七七公斤
    每个劳动力分得　三五公斤
    所以从饲养牲口方面也清楚地看出合作社社员和阿格斯顿的收入的不同。在合作社里，大规模的饲畜业在不断地进步着。饲养牲口的人的精力只集中在照管牲口的工作上，不必分心去管别的事。养牛的人只负责喂草料、给水、挤奶和保持牛的清洁。养猪的人就照管母猪，大猪和小猪。在专门负责的工作中，他们都慢慢地熟悉了饲养牲口的先进方法，成为他们那一行的熟练工作者了。毫无疑问，单干农民在喂养牲口上也积累了一些知识，但是专门做一件工作能够不断地进步，这到底不同。伊哈斯在合作社喂牛已有两年的经验，瓦莫斯喂猪也很久了。他们的工作都很好，他们的技术和经验对于合作社有很大的用处。每月单是在自由市场出售牛奶的收入就是四、五千福林（匈币名）。饲养员做好了工作，不仅合作社有利润，他们自己的收入也增加了。
    社员们除了在合作社工作，都另有一块自己的土地，每一家有一头牛、一口母猪和几口猪、十五至二十只鸡。从这里面得到的收益也不少。二分之一或四分之三霍尔德土地的出产就可以支付合作农户的一大笔开销了。例如社员彼得自己的地里去年出产一千二百公斤玉蜀黍，他用这些玉蜀黍养肥了一口大猪和几个别的家畜。社员文泽私人喂养一头牛，每天有十五公升牛奶。他们家喝不完的奶就拿到市场上去卖，有时也做成奶酪和黄油去卖。
    从这些事实看来，很容易了解为什么“青年近卫军”农业生产合作社的社员那样有信心。几年前，他们都是单独地对付生活上的一切困难。今天，所有的问题都由四十五个合作社社员共同解决。自从他们组织了合作社，开始集体耕种后，他们的生活方式起了根本的变化。现在，文泽家已经盖起了新房子，最近他又买了家具和一个无线电收音机。他计划明年春天买一辆自行车。维勒士去年结账后，全家都缝了新衣服。他的女儿出嫁时还买了六千福林的家具作嫁奁。
    但是，农业生产合作社的社员们从集体耕种所得到的好处不仅是收入而已。他们的文化要求也高涨了。冬闲的时候，他们去听关于种庄稼和饲养牲畜的演讲，到合作社的图书馆去看报读书。合作社主席伊勒士正在打算去进专门学校，因为他在自己九霍尔德的土地上所获得的实际经验，拿来管理合作社的几百霍尔德土地已显得不够了。合作社里非常需要受过技术训练的人。
      “青年近卫军”农业生产合作社的社员们谁也不想退出合作社。集体工作和丰盛的收成已经把他们牢固地团结在一起了。
