    Li Seung-man's agents have recently been forcing prisoners of war in the Dongchang-ri POW camp to form military organizations and intensify training in preparation for abducting prisoners of war to "escape" from the camp. This is clearly part of the U.S. plot to delay the convening of the political conference and forcibly detain prisoners of war.
    Wei Zhengfan, a Korean People's Army prisoner of war who escaped by climbing the barbed wire from Camp 38 and returned on the 3rd through repatriation, said: Kim Bong-nam, the head of the Li Seung-man special agent in Camp 38, has often openly said to the prisoners of war: "The explanation work is coming to an end. If they are not released after December 23rd, we will hold a collective demonstration and take the opportunity to riot and escape."
    In order to prepare for the riot and escape from the camp, Li Seung-man's agents have selected a group of prisoners of war between the ages of 20 and 30 from each camp, forcibly formed "special attack teams," and forced them to undergo military training. The "special attack team" organized in Camp 38 has more than 70 people and is now being forced to undergo military training. Wei Zhengfan also saw the "special attack team" in Camp 40 practicing shooting and bayonet drills with more than a dozen wooden rifles through the barbed wire. Wu Dongye, a Korean People's Army prisoner of war who escaped by climbing the barbed wire from Camp 49 and was repatriated on the 3rd, was forced to join the "special attack team." The agents lured him by saying: "Join the 'special attack team' and contribute to the riot. In the future, you can be a military police officer in South Korea."
    Returnees said that these illegal activities of Li and Chiang's agents are constantly directed by the United States. After the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission decided on November 13th to "request the United Nations Command to take urgent measures to prevent any future illegal activities of personnel serving in the 64th Field Hospital," the illegal activities of U.S. agents in the "hospital" did not stop at all. Returnee Wu Dongye personally witnessed the special agent Li Dongmo in Camp 49 tying letters to stones and throwing them over the barbed wire to the South Korean "nurses" in the "hospital" on the evenings of November 13th and 17th. On the evening of November 20th, Wu Dongye saw a South Korean "nurse" throw a letter to a special agent in Camp 49.

    美方指挥特务加紧准备劫持战俘
    【新华社开城八日电】李承晚特务最近在东场里战俘营中把战俘强迫编成军事组织，加紧训练，准备劫持战俘越营“逃跑”。这显然是美方拖延政治会议召开、以强迫扣留战俘的阴谋计划的一部分。
  从三十八号营场爬铁丝网逃出于三日遣返归来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员卫正番说：三十八号营场里的李承晚特务大队长金凤男最近常常公开对战俘说：“解释工作快完蛋了，要是过了十二月二十三日还不释放，就要集体游行示威，趁机暴动逃跑。”
    李承晚特务为了准备暴动越营，已在各营场挑选出一批二十岁至三十岁的被俘人员，强迫编成“特攻队”，并强迫他们受军事训练。三十八号营场组织的“特攻队”有七十多个人，现在正被迫受军事训练。卫正番还曾隔着铁丝网看见四十号营场的“特攻队”用十几支木头制成的步枪，练习射击、刺杀。从四十九号营场爬铁丝网逃出于三日遣返的朝鲜人民军被俘人员吴东叶就曾被迫参加“特攻队”，特务们曾诱骗他说：参加“特攻队”，到暴动的时候出一把力，将来到南朝鲜可以当宪兵。
    归来人员说，李蒋特务这些非法活动不断得到美方的指挥。在十一月十三日中立国遣返委员会决定“要求联合国军司令部采取紧急措施，来防止在六十四野战医院中服务的人员今后的任何非法活动”以后，“医院”中的美方特务的非法活动丝毫没有停止。归来人员吴东叶曾在十一月十三日和十七日两天的黄昏，亲眼看见四十九号营场内的特务李东默把信件绑在石头上隔着铁丝网扔给“医院”中的南朝鲜“护士”。十一月二十日黄昏，吴东叶又看见南朝鲜“护士”把一封信件扔给四十九号营场的特务分子。
