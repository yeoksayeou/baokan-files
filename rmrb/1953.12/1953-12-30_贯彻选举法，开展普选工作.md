The districts within the capital city have announced the voter lists; people from all walks of life express warm congratulations.

The districts within the capital city, which are currently conducting grassroots elections, have announced the voter lists. Voters are jubilantly celebrating their acquisition of the glorious right to vote. In recent days, various colored flags have been hung at the entrances of government offices, enterprises, schools, shops, and residential buildings throughout the city. In the central areas of each electoral district, beautifully decorated walls display long voter lists. Next to each voter list, a public notice from the People's Court regarding the protection of the people's right to vote is also posted. The publication of the voter lists has added a festive atmosphere to the capital city on the eve of the New Year. Crowds of people flow through the streets and alleys to view the voter lists.

Workers in the capital's factories, with the proud feeling of being masters of the country, express boundless excitement about the publication of the voter lists and are actively taking action to welcome this joyous event. Workers from the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant formed a team of nearly a thousand people, dancing collective dances in front of the voter lists and performing waist drums and folk tunes. Xu Zhensheng, a labor model from the plant who was recently promoted from lathe operator to technician, said upon the publication of the voter list that he would strive to improve his political and technical level, humbly learn from his comrades, and do a good job in the currently unfamiliar work of compiling process procedures. The Beijing No. 1 Printing Factory, the Beijing People's Leather and Sports Goods Factory, and the Beijing Pharmaceutical Factory Tablet Workshop have all recently completed their annual production plans or increased production and saved resources ahead of schedule, and have proposed new targets for increasing production and saving resources as a gift to the general election.

When the voter list was announced at the Renmin University of China, students from various departments flocked to the voter list in groups, singing and dancing. In this new type of higher education institution, there are veteran revolutionary cadres who have experienced hundreds of battles, combat heroes who have made meritorious contributions in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and labor models who have made outstanding contributions on the construction front of the motherland. Hao Jianxiu and Hang Peilan, nationally renowned labor models studying at the Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School attached to Renmin University, also came to the voter list. Everyone excitedly looked at the names on the list, and the sounds of firecrackers, cheers, and songs intertwined. When Tsinghua University announced the voter list, a student named Gao Yuan said: Today's announcement of the voter list makes me feel infinitely excited. In the past, in order to fight for freedom and democratic rights, we were on the blacklists of the reactionaries. Now, those days are gone forever.

At the Central Institute for Nationalities, which gathers forty-seven different ethnic groups, a grand unveiling ceremony was held. When thirteen students from eight ethnic groups including Tibetan, Li, Kazak, Uyghur, Yi, Gaoshan, Mongolian, and Kyrgyz unveiled the voter list written in eleven ethnic languages, the whole audience cheered. Music in various ethnic forms resonated, and students in brightly colored ethnic costumes danced excitedly. A Living Buddha from the Muli Monastery in Xikang, who works at the institute, happily said: It is so exciting to be able to participate in the general election in the capital! Since liberation, not only have our ethnic minorities improved their lives, but they have also achieved true equality in politics!

The red voter list was posted on the wall near the Longxugou residential area, which has been transformed from poverty and filth. Now, it is a clean and tidy main road. The children who used to pick up coal cinders and scraps are now wearing red scarves and new clothes, and playing waist drums to celebrate their parents' acquisition of the glorious right to vote. On this day, Old Man Wang, seventy-four years old, who has lived near Longxugou for decades, led his grandson to see the voter list. He said with emotion: In the past, there was no way we people could participate in elections. But today, eight of my family's seventeen members over the age of eighteen are on the voter list.

In Niujie, where Muslim residents are most concentrated, people also warmly celebrated the publication of the voter list. Yang Mingyuan, the Imam of the famous Niujie Mosque, welcomed the publication of the voter list according to their religious rules, with a ceremony celebrating a great joyous day. The voter list was posted in front of the Yonghe Temple, and the abbot of the Yonghe Temple, Ishga Oara Lama, presented a Hada to the voter list to express his warm congratulations.

Shanghai Workers Enthusiastically Participate in the General Election Movement

Hundreds of thousands of steel, machinery, and textile workers in Shanghai are enthusiastically participating in the general election movement with a high degree of political enthusiasm.

Under the education and encouragement of the general line, Shanghai workers warmly welcome the arrival of the general election. Promotional slogans and pictures for the general election can be seen everywhere in the factories. Workers are earnestly studying the general election documents during reading and rest periods, and they deeply feel the glory and responsibility of being masters of their own affairs. Many workers are requesting to join the Communist Party of China and the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. On the day the voter lists were announced, young workers in various factories couldn't wait to wipe the oil off their hands and rushed to see the lists as soon as they got off work. Everyone was proud to have their name on the list. Between the first iron gate and the third iron gate of the Shenxin No. 9 Cotton Mill, there were six voter lists, more than ten zhang long in total, listing the names of more than six thousand citizens. The year before the liberation of Shanghai, in this same area, six or seven thousand manual workers persisted in the famous "February 2nd" strike to fight for reasonable treatment and resisted the attack of armored vehicles, tear gas, and submachine guns of the Kuomintang reactionaries. Workers in the Chen Fengxiu team in the weaving workshop said: In the past, when our names were posted, it meant either a fine or dismissal; today, our names are on the list, but it shows that we are the masters of the country. Many elderly workers saw the voter list and, remembering that this democratic right was exchanged for the blood of countless martyrs, shed tears of excitement. Many workers have put forward challenges and responses to complete and overfulfill production plans, expressing their desire to consolidate the people's democratic regime with new production achievements.

On the day the Shanghai No. 2 Textile Machinery Factory announced the voter list, the blackboard newspaper was written with large double happiness characters, and the workshops were filled with red flags of production winners. The Lu Agou team had already completed its annual production plan and increased production and saved resources plan ahead of schedule on December 15th to celebrate the general election. During the general election movement, the female workers in the roving frame workshop of the Shenxin No. 1 Cotton Mill generally increased their spindle tending capacity by more than 50%.

Wuhan Workers Actively Participate in Grassroots Elections

Workers in many factories in Wuhan are taking active actions to complete this year's national production plan ahead of schedule to welcome the general election.

The factories in Wuhan participating in the first batch of grassroots elections unfolded one after another during the busiest production months of November and December. After the workers understood the great significance of the general election, their production enthusiasm became even higher. The team led by Zhu Zaodi, a famous special-class labor model in Wuhan and a roving frame worker at the joint state-private Hankou No. 1 Textile Company, took the lead in guaranteeing to the entire factory that it would complete the annual national production plan eleven days ahead of schedule in order to welcome the general election. The workers of the Wuchang Shipyard Hanyang Branch, Wuhan Oil Factory, and Xinya Paper Mill all actively responded to the Party's call during the general election activities and pushed the production competition to a new climax. All the workers of the state-owned Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory are working selflessly to realize the completion of the national annual plan thirty-six hours ahead of schedule. During the general election activities, the joint state-private Yuhua Yarn Factory constantly reported production successes: the entire factory had completed the annual national plan ahead of schedule on December 4th; on December 9th, it had also successfully completed the fourth quarter's plan to increase production and save resources. These good news doubled the workers' production enthusiasm.

During the election, workers used their spare time from production to engage in various general election activities. The cultural and artistic troupes and amateur art groups in many factories were particularly active, and they rehearsed many programs to promote the general election and performed them in the entire factory. Many factories held full discussions on the candidates before the election, and voters elected many outstanding Communist Party members and non-Party members. Zhu Zaodi, a special-class labor model in Wuhan, Wang Shiheng, a seventh-grade maintenance technician, and Ye Kuisheng, an engineer at the Yuhua Yarn Factory who successfully modified old British roving frames, which can increase production by more than 20 billion yuan each year, were all elected as district people's representatives with extremely high numbers of votes.

    首都市内各区公布选民榜  各界人民表示热烈祝贺
    首都正在进行基层选举的市内各区已公布了选民榜，选民们欢欣鼓舞地为自己获得光荣的选举权利而祝贺。最近几天，市内各机关、企业、学校、商店和居民住宅的门口，都悬挂着各色的彩旗。在各选区的中心地带，被装饰得十分美丽的墙上，张贴着长幅的选民榜。在每个选民榜的旁边，还张贴着普选人民法庭有关保障人民选举权利问题的通告。选民名单的公布，使新年前夕的首都增添了喜气融融的景象。大街小巷到处流动着看选民名单的人群。
    首都各厂的工人们以国家主人翁的自豪心情，为选民名单的公布表示无限兴奋，并纷纷以实际行动迎接这件喜事。北京第一机床厂的职工们组成了近千人的队伍，在选民名单前跳起集体舞，还表演了腰鼓和小调。最近从车工被提拔为技术员的该厂劳动模范徐振生在选民名单公布时，表示要努力提高政治和技术水平，虚心向同志们学习，做好目前还是生疏的编制工艺规程的工作。北京市印刷一厂、北京市人民制革体育用品厂、北京市制药厂片剂车间最近都提前完成了全年生产计划或增产节约计划，并提出了新的增产节约目标，向普选献礼。
    当选民榜在中国人民大学公布时，各系的同学们成群结队载歌载舞地涌到选民榜前。在这座新型的高等学校里，有身经百战的革命老干部，有在抗美援朝斗争中立下战功的战斗英雄，也有在祖国建设战线上有过卓越贡献的劳动模范。在人民大学附设工农速成中学学习的全国闻名的劳动模范郝建秀、杭佩兰也来到选民榜前。大家激动地看着榜上的名字，鞭炮声、欢呼声和歌声交织到一起。清华大学公布选民榜时，一位名叫高原的学生说：今天公布选民榜，使我感到无限兴奋，过去我们为了争取自由和民主权利，曾上过反动派的黑名单，现在，那样的日子已经一去不复返了。
    在聚集着四十七个不同民族的中央民族学院里，隆重举行了揭榜仪式。当该校藏、黎、哈萨克、维吾尔、彝、高山、蒙古、柯尔克兹等八个民族的十三个学生，揭开了用十一种民族文字写成的选民榜时，全场顿时欢呼起来。各种民族形式的音乐交响着，穿着鲜艳的民族服装的学生兴奋地舞蹈着。在该院工作的西康木雅贡噶寺的活佛愉快地说：能够在首都参加普选，太使人兴奋了，解放以后我们少数民族不但在生活上获得了改善，政治上也得到了真正的平等！
    红色的选民榜张贴在从穷困和污秽中翻过身来的龙须沟居民区附近的墙上。现在，这里已是整洁的大马路了。过去捡煤核、捡破烂的孩子们，今天带着红领巾，穿上新衣，打着腰鼓来为自己的爸爸妈妈获得光荣的选举权利而祝贺。这一天，在龙须沟旁边居住了几十年的七十四岁的王老头领着他的孙子来看选民榜，他感慨地说：选举这事过去那有我们这些人的份。可是今天我家十七口人就有八个十八岁以上的人上了选民榜。
    在伊斯兰教居民最集中的牛街，人民也热烈欢庆选民榜的公布。著名的牛街清真寺教长杨明远，按他们的教规，用庆贺大喜日子的仪式迎接选民榜的公布。选民榜张贴在雍和宫前，雍和宫的住持伊什噶咓喇嘛并向选民榜敬献哈达，表示热烈祝贺。
    上海工人热烈地投入普选运动
    上海市数十万钢铁、机械、纺织工人，正以高度的政治热情投入普选运动。
    上海工人在总路线的教育和鼓舞下，热情地迎接普选的到来。工厂里到处可以见到普选的宣传标语和图片，工人们利用读报和休息时间认真学习了普选文件，他们亲切地体会到当家作主的光荣感和责任感。许多工人要求参加中国共产党和中国新民主主义青年团。选民榜公布那天，各厂的青年工人们一下班，来不及揩去手上的油污，就赶紧跑去看榜。每个人都以榜上有自己的名字而自豪。在申新第九棉纺织厂的第一道铁门到第三道铁门中间，挂着共有十多丈长的六块选民榜，排列着六千多个公民的姓名。在上海解放的前一年，就在这块地方曾经有六七千徒手工人，坚持了为争取合理待遇而掀起的著名的“二·二”罢工斗争，反击了国民党反动派装甲车、催泪弹、冲锋枪的进攻。织布间陈凤秀小组的工人说：过去，我们的名字一贴出来，不是罚工，就是解雇；今天榜上有了我们的名字，但却表示我们是国家的主人了。许多老年工人看到了选民榜，想起这是无数先烈以鲜血换来的民主权利，激动地流下眼泪。很多工人提出了完成和超额完成生产计划的挑战书和应战书，表示要用新的生产成果来巩固人民民主政权。
    国营上海第二纺织机械厂公布选民榜的那天，黑板报上写着斗大的双喜字，车间里插满了生产优胜红旗。陆阿狗小组为了庆贺普选，已于十二月十五日提前完成了全年的生产计划和增产节约计划。申新第一棉纺织厂细纱间的女工们在普选运动中，看锭能力普遍提高了百分之五十以上。
    武汉市工人积极参加基层选举
    武汉市许多工厂的工人纷纷以提前完成今年国家生产计划的积极行动来迎接普选。
    武汉市参加第一批基层选举的工厂是在生产最紧张的十一、十二月份先后展开的。当工人们懂得了普选的重大意义后，生产情绪更加高涨。武汉市著名的特等劳动模范、公私合营汉口第一纺织公司细纱工人朱早弟领导的小组，为了迎接普选，首先向全厂提出了提前十一天完成全年国家生产计划的保证。武昌造船厂汉阳分厂、武汉油厂、新亚造纸厂的工人们在普选活动中都积极响应党的号召，把生产竞赛推向新的高潮。国营武汉第一棉纺织厂全厂工人正为实现提前三十六小时完成国家全年计划而忘我地劳动着。公私合营裕华纱厂在普选活动中，不断地传出生产捷报：全厂在十二月四日已提前完成了全年国家计划；十二月九日又胜利地完成了第四季度增产节约计划。这些喜报加倍地鼓舞了工人们的生产热情。
    在选举中，工人们利用生产空隙时间投入各种普选活动。许多工厂的文工团和业余文艺团体特别活跃，他们排练了许多宣传普选节目在全厂公演。许多工厂在选举前对候选人都进行了充分的讨论，选民们把许多优秀的共产党员和非党人士选举出来。武汉市特等劳动模范朱早弟，七级保全技术工人王世鋐，改装英式老细纱机成功每年可增产二百多亿元的裕华纱厂工程师叶奎声等都以极高的票数当选为区人民代表。　（据新华社讯）
