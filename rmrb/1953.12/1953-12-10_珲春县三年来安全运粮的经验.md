Hunchun County in Jilin Province is located in a mountainous area with high mountains, large ridges, difficult driving, and inconvenient transportation. In addition, the grain delivery roads are long. Every year during grain delivery, the district farthest from the grain station has to travel 220 *li*, and the farthest village has to travel 350 *li*. Generally, they are also 20 to 30 *li* away from the grain station. Therefore, grain delivery vehicles are prone to casualties. However, due to the importance attached to the work by the county and district leaders, and their specific organization and leadership of the grain delivery work, no casualties to people or animals have occurred in the transportation of public grain in the past three years, and the grain delivery task has been safely completed. The main experiences are as follows:

   I. Leading Cadres Specifically Lead the Grain Delivery Work

    In the early days of liberation, Hunchun County experienced continuous casualties due to a lack of experience in grain delivery. Since 1950, the county leaders have learned from the lessons and conscientiously implemented the instructions of the Provincial People's Government on the safe transportation of public grain. Through training courses, district and village cadre meetings, and people's representative meetings, they studied and discussed the instructions on safe grain delivery. The county people's representative meeting also made a resolution on doing a good job in grain requisition. After the start of grain delivery, in addition to district cadres dispatched by each district to regularly take care of the vehicle order in their respective districts, the county head, the head of the Finance and Grain Section, and grain requisition work cadres personally went to grain stations, vehicle shops, and streets to conduct publicity and inspection, and sometimes helped unload vehicles and take care of livestock. This motivated the farmers, made them more vigilant, and strived for safe grain delivery, eliminating the phenomenon of human and animal casualties.

    II. Doing a Good Job of Preparation Before Transportation

    To achieve safe grain delivery, it is very important to carry out ideological education, make material preparations, and organizational preparations in advance. 1. Conduct ideological education: Before grain delivery, conduct extensive patriotic education among the masses, educating farmers to select good grain to send to the state. This not only improves the awareness of the masses, but also reduces the phenomenon of unqualified public grain, ensuring the completion of the grain requisition plan and avoiding casualties. Before grain delivery, it is necessary to first conduct short-term training courses for county, district, and village cadres based on specific conditions to carry out policy education and ideological education on caring for the lives and property of the people, and strengthen the sense of responsibility of the cadres. Through cadres, publicize to the masses to raise the masses' awareness and vigilance. 2. Do a good job of material preparation: Before the public grain is transported, it is first necessary to select good grain delivery vehicles and livestock, and prepare ropes, sacks, fodder, vehicle oil, as well as cotton clothes, cotton hats, and cotton shoes for the people following the vehicles. Cadres should carefully check, and if they find anything missing or broken, they should immediately mobilize the masses to replenish them. 3. Organizational preparation: To eliminate accidents, the organization must be strict. After the vehicles and livestock are selected, they must be combined into teams, with districts as large teams, villages as medium teams, and villages or administrative groups as small teams. At the same time, select captains for each team (the large team captain is held by a district cadre) to be responsible for leading the grain delivery vehicles. Determine the carrying capacity according to the strength of the livestock and the condition of the vehicles to avoid accidents caused by overloading. Then determine the vehicle owners and the people following the vehicles, and formulate driving regulations. The people who deliver grain must also have a clear division of labor. Those who unload vehicles and carry bags are selected for their strength, those who are weak take care of the livestock, and those who are older can manage the bags. After these tasks are prepared, submit a grain transportation plan, and finally the county and each grain station sign a receiving contract. 4. Repair bridges and roads: Although the mountain roads in Hunchun County are still relatively flat, they must be carefully repaired before grain delivery, and sentries must be placed on dangerous roads. In addition, the things used to repair vehicles should be carried with the vehicle, so that they can be repaired in time in the event of an accident.

    III. Relevant Departments Are Individually Responsible for Ensuring Safe Grain Delivery

    After the discussion and approval at the county people's representative meeting to take grain requisition work as one of the central tasks of the fourth quarter, various departments closely contacted each other, divided their responsibilities, and did a good job in grain requisition work. Grain stations ensure timely receiving and testing according to plan, and weighing personnel should be "accurate" and "fast." Village supply and marketing cooperatives must ensure the supply of materials, so that the masses have whatever they need. The militia must do a good job in escorting, and the public security forces are responsible for maintaining urban traffic and grain field order. Staff of all departments worked actively and set off a climax of eliminating accidents.

    IV. Conscientiously Implement the Method of Delivering Grain in Batches, in Areas, and Collectively

    Hunchun County delivers grain by using the method of delivering grain in batches, in areas, under unified organization, and collectively. In order to eliminate accidents, the ten districts of the county are arranged in order of priority according to the progress of preparatory work, and delivered in batches, thus avoiding accidents caused by too many vehicles and disorder in the city. At the same time, according to the traffic situation, they are divided into two groups to receive, with the sixth and seventh districts as one group, and the remaining eight districts as another group. After arranging the order, the captains of each team lead the collective transportation. In 1952, each small team arranged the vehicles in numbers, wrote the numbers on the fire prevention and forest protection badges, and the large team captain wore a red armband and carried a grain transportation letter of introduction, indicating the number of vehicles, variety, quantity, etc. In this way, everyone acted in order, which further ensured the safety of grain transportation.

    珲春县三年来安全运粮的经验
    穆青林  全世振  佟盛海
    吉林省珲春县位居山岳地带，山高岭大，行车困难，交通不便。同时送粮道路又远，每年送粮时，距离粮站最远的区要走二百二十华里。最远的村要走三百五十华里，一般的离粮站也有二、三十华里，因此送粮车辆很易发生伤亡事故，但由于县区领导的重视，并具体地组织领导了送粮工作，因而三年来在运送公粮中没有发生人畜伤亡事故，安全完成了送粮任务。主要经验有以下几点：
   一、领导干部具体领导送粮工作
    珲春县在解放初期，由于对送粮工作没有经验，人畜伤亡事故不断发生。从一九五○年起，县领导上接受了教训，认真地贯彻了省人民政府关于安全运送公粮的指示，通过训练班、区村干部会议以及人民代表会议等形式，学习讨论了安全送粮指示。县人民代表会议并做出关于做好征粮工作的决议。在送粮开始后，除各区派来的区干部经常照管本区的车辆秩序外，县长、财粮科长和征粮工作干部都亲自到粮站、车店、街道，进行宣传和检查，有时并帮助卸车、看牲口，这样就带动了农民，使农民提高警惕，努力做到安全送粮，杜绝了人、畜伤亡现象。
    二、做好运送前的准备工作
    要做到安全送粮，事前进行思想教育、做好物质准备和组织准备等工作是非常重要的。一、进行思想教育：在送粮前要向群众广泛地进行爱国主义教育，教育农民选好粮送给国家，这不但提高了群众的觉悟，也减少了公粮不合规格的现象，保证了征粮计划的完成和避免伤亡事故的发生。在送粮前，要根据具体条件，首先开办县区村干部短期训练班进行政策与爱护人民生命财产的思想教育，加强干部的责任心。通过干部向群众进行宣传，提高群众觉悟和警惕性。二、做好物质准备工作：公粮运送前首先要选好送粮的车和牲畜，准备好绳套、麻袋、草料、车油以及跟车人的棉衣、棉帽、棉鞋等。干部要认真检查，发现缺少或破碎的要马上动员群众添补。三、组织上的准备工作：为消灭事故，组织必须严密。车辆、牲畜挑选好后，要进行合车编队，区为大队，村为中队，屯或行政小组为小队，同时选出各队队长（大队长由区干部担任），负责带领送粮车辆。根据牲口的强弱、车辆的好坏规定载重量，以免装的多发生事故。然后再确定车老板和跟车的人，并订立行车公约。送粮的人也要有明确分工，卸车和扛袋子的都挑选身强力壮的，身体软弱的看牲口，岁数大的人可以经管袋子，把这些工作准备好以后，提出运粮计划，最后由县和各粮站订立接收合同。四、检修桥梁道路：珲春县的山路虽然还比较平整，但在送粮前还要细致的修补，并在险要的道路上放上岗哨。另外修理车辆用的东西都要随车带上，以便在发生事故时可及时修理。
    三、有关部门分工负责，保证安全送粮
    在县人民代表会议上讨论通过把征粮工作作为第四季度的中心工作之一以后，各部门密切联系，分工负责，做好征粮工作。粮站保证做到按计划及时接收、化验，过秤人员要做到“准”“快”，村供销合作社要保证物资供应，做到群众用啥有啥，民兵要做好护送工作，公安部队负责维持城市交通和粮场秩序。各部门工作人员都积极工作，掀起了消灭事故的高潮。
    四、认真执行分批分片集体送粮的办法
    珲春县送粮是用分批分片、统一组织、集体送粮的办法进行的。为了做到消灭事故，根据准备工作的先后，把全县十个区排成先后次序，分批运送，这样就避免了城市车多、马乱发生事故。同时根据交通情况分成两片接收，六、七区为一片，其余的八个区为一片，按排好顺序，由各队队长带领着集体运送。一九五二年，每小队都按车辆排成号，利用防火护林胸章写上号码，大车队长带着红袖标，并带着运粮介绍信，注明车数、品种、数量等，这样，大家按次序行动，更加保障了运粮的安全。
