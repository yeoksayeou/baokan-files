Present were Lin Boqu, Secretary-General of the Central People's Government; Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs; Nie Rongzhen, Acting Chief of General Staff of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission; Wang Bingnan, Director of the General Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Yu Xinqing, Director of the Bureau of Ceremonies of the Central People's Government; Huan Xiang, Director of the Department of Western European and African Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and Wang Zhuoru, Chief of the Protocol Department.

Envoy Sundström's Eulogy:

Mr. Chairman,

I have the honor to present to you the letter of credence from the President of the Republic of Finland appointing me as the Envoy Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Finland to the People's Republic of China. And please allow me to forward to you the letter of recall of the former envoy, Mr. Knoelling.

At the same time, I am honored to convey to you, Mr. Chairman, the congratulations of the President of the Republic of Finland and his wishes for your personal happiness and for the achievements of the government and people of the People's Republic of China.

I am deeply gratified to note that Finland established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China shortly after the founding of the People's Republic, and that significant achievements have been made in this relatively short period. A solid foundation has been laid for developing trade relations between our two countries. Thanks to the kind assistance of the Government of the People's Republic of China, the Finnish cultural delegation was able to understand the heritage of ancient Chinese culture and to recognize the all-encompassing and purposeful construction being carried out in this great China, which has been damaged by years of war. I hope that on the basis of this foundation, I will be able to further promote the friendly relations between our two countries.

Mr. Chairman, please allow me to assure you that I will do everything in my power to carry out this important and honorable task entrusted to me. In this regard, I hope to receive the benevolent support of you and the Government of the People's Republic of China.

Chairman Mao's Reply:

Mr. Envoy,

I am very pleased to accept the letter of credence from the President of the Republic of Finland presented by Your Excellency, and I express my gratitude for the congratulations conveyed by the President of the Republic of Finland to the Government and people of the People's Republic of China and to me personally.

Over the past three years, the friendly relations of economic and cultural cooperation between China and Finland have achieved significant development. I believe that in the future, with Your Excellency's efforts, the friendly relations between our two countries will become increasingly close on the existing foundation. The enhancement of this friendly relationship will not only further consolidate the friendship between the people of the two countries but also contribute to the world peace that all the people of the world are striving for.

I warmly welcome Your Excellency's appointment as the Envoy Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Finland to the People's Republic of China. In Your Excellency's work to strengthen the friendly cooperation between China and Finland, you will receive the assistance of me and the Government of the People's Republic of China.

I wish Your Excellency success in your work.
