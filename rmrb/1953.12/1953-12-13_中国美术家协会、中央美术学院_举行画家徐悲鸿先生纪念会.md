The Chinese Artists Association and the Central Academy of Fine Arts held a memorial meeting for the famous Chinese painter Mr. Xu Beihong in Beijing on the morning of the 11th. The preview of the Xu Beihong's posthumous works exhibition was also held on the afternoon of the same day.

Among those who attended the memorial meeting were figures from the literary and art circles and friends of Mr. Xu Beihong during his lifetime, including Zhou Yang, Zhang Xiruo, Li Siguang, Tian Han, Ding Ling, Luo Longji, Yang Hansheng, Sa Kongliao, Shao Quanlin, Feng Xuefeng, Wang Lanxi, Tang Yongtong, Jian Bozan, Ye Gongchuo, Jiang Feng, Wu Zuoren, Liu Kaiqu, Ye Qianyu, Cai Ruohong, Chen Banding, Yu Feian, and others, as well as teachers and students from the Central Academy of Fine Arts, family members of Mr. Xu Beihong, totaling more than 500 people. Sokolov, a representative of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, also attended the memorial meeting.

The memorial meeting was presided over by Jiang Feng, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Artists Association and Vice President of the Central Academy of Fine Arts.

Zhou Yang, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government and Vice Chairman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, presented a wreath to Mr. Xu Beihong's portrait. All attendees stood in solemn silence to mourn the death of this outstanding artist of the motherland.

Wu Zuoren, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Artists Association, reported on Mr. Xu Beihong's life and deeds at the memorial meeting. He concluded by saying: Mr. Xu Beihong loved the motherland and was loyal to art. With his upright, sincere, and tireless life, he created meticulously studied sketches, richly colored oil paintings, and thousands of ink and wash paintings. We should commemorate him and learn from him.

Zhou Yang pointed out in his speech at the memorial meeting: Mr. Xu Beihong was an outstanding painter and an outstanding art educator of the Chinese people. His death is a major loss to China's literary and art circles. He inherited the realist tradition of Chinese national painting and absorbed the realist creative methods and techniques from Western classical painting. In his artistic creations, he demonstrated a combination of high skill and strong national characteristics. In his artistic propositions, he always believed in realism and opposed formalism. His works expressed a tendency to love the motherland and sympathize with the people. He participated in the Chinese people's movement for democracy even before liberation. He made great contributions to art education. With the correct methods of realism and an unparalleled love and concern for artistic talent, he cultivated the younger generation of Chinese artists. His spirit of diligent study and practice in artistic creation is a model for everyone. Therefore, we should commemorate him, learn from him, and treat his posthumous works as an important artistic heritage to be studied.

Sokolov was also invited to speak at the meeting. He said: Mr. Xu Beihong was a friend of the Soviet people. In 1934, he held a Chinese art exhibition in the Soviet Union. In 1936, at his suggestion, a Soviet print exhibition was held in Shanghai and Nanjing. The Oriental Museum in the Soviet Union also displays his works. His works have also been repeatedly published in Soviet books and magazines and have been welcomed by the Soviet people.

Also speaking at the memorial meeting were Tian Han, a playwright and friend of Mr. Xu Beihong during his lifetime, a student representative from the Central Academy of Fine Arts, and Liao Jingwen, Mr. Xu Beihong's wife.

The Xu Beihong's posthumous works exhibition was organized by the Chinese Artists Association and the Central Academy of Fine Arts to commemorate Mr. Xu Beihong and introduce his achievements in art creation to society. It officially opened on the 12th at the Zhongshan Hall in Zhongshan Park, Beijing. The 226 works on display were selected from more than 800 works he personally left behind, including traditional Chinese paintings, oil paintings, sketches, and pastel paintings. The creation period ranges from 1921 to 1953. From these works, one can see the life of a remarkable artist's diligent creation and his consistent spirit of adhering to realism in his creation.

In addition to all the people who attended the memorial meeting, diplomatic officials from various countries stationed in China and reporters from various countries in Beijing also visited the preview of the exhibition on the 11th. (Xinhua News Agency)

    中国美术家协会、中央美术学院于十一日上午在北京举行我国著名画家徐悲鸿先生纪念会。徐悲鸿先生遗作展览会也在同日下午举行预展。

    中国美术家协会副主席吴作人在纪念会上报告了徐悲鸿先生的生平事迹。最后他说：徐悲鸿先生热爱祖国，忠于艺术，以正直、诚恳、勤劳不息的一生，创造出精心钻研的素描，色彩浓郁的油画，以及数以千计的彩墨画。我们要纪念他，也要学习他。
    周扬在纪念会的讲话中指出：徐悲鸿先生是中国人民的杰出的画家，卓越的艺术教育家。他的逝世，是我国文艺界的重大损失。他继承了中国民族绘画的现实主义传统，并吸取了西洋古典绘画中的现实主义创作方法和技巧，在他的艺术创造中，表现了高度技巧和浓厚的民族特色的结合；他在艺术主张上始终是信奉现实主义而反对形式主义的。他的作品表现了热爱祖国，同情人民的倾向，他在解放以前即参加了中国人民争取民主的运动。他在艺术教育事业上有极大的贡献，他以现实主义的正确方法和对艺术天才的无比热爱与关心，培养了中国年青一代的美术家。他在艺术创造上勤练笃学的精神，足为大家模范。因此我们应当纪念他，学习他，并将他的遗作当作重要艺术遗产加以研究。
    索科洛夫也应邀在会上讲话。他说：徐悲鸿先生是苏联人民的朋友，一九三四年他在苏联举行了中国艺术展览会；一九三六年又由于他的建议，在上海和南京举行了苏联版画展览会。苏联的东方博物馆还陈列有他的作品。他的作品也曾经一再发表在苏联的书籍和刊物中，受到苏联人民的欢迎。
    在纪念会上讲话的，还有徐悲鸿先生生前友好、戏剧家田汉，中央美术学院学生代表，和徐悲鸿夫人廖静文。
    徐悲鸿遗作展览会，是中国美术家协会、中央美术学院为纪念徐悲鸿先生和向社会介绍他在美术创作上的成就而举办的，十二日正式开幕，会场在北京中山公园中山堂。展出的二百二十六件作品，是从他个人所遗存的八百多件作品中选出的，包括国画、油画、素描、粉画。创作时期由一九二一年到一九五三年。从这些作品中，可以看到一个卓越艺术家勤劳创作的一生，和他在创作上一贯坚持现实主义作风的精神。
