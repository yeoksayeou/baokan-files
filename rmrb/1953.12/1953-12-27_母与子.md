Mother and Son
    Yin Chujing

    I want to tell the story of an ordinary Korean mother and an ordinary Korean child. The mother's name is Zheng Yuecheng, and the child's name is Guo Chunlong. Zheng Yuecheng was twenty-four when her husband died, and Guo Chunlong was only four years old. Zheng Yuecheng took her child to work as a hired hand, living a life that, as Zheng Yuecheng said, was "earning one day to eat for one day, having food but no clothes." After liberation, the mother and son tasted the flavor of truly human life for the first time. Soon, Zheng Yuecheng joined the Jialinli Baitoushan Forest Railway Construction Undertaking, and life got better day by day. But then the war came. In October 1950, the enemy approached Huishan County on the Yalu River, and the sound of the invaders' cannons threatened the hopeful life of the mother and son. Guo Chunlong was only seventeen at this time, but he was already a member of the Democratic Youth League, practically an adult. However, his age and weight did not meet the standards for joining the army. He thought, "Not being at the front lines doesn't count as being a youth." After much deliberation, on October 20th, he splashed ink on his birth certificate, changing seventeen to nineteen, and carrying several stones close to his body, he registered to join the army in Putianbao. That same evening, he rushed home to bid farewell to his mother. Zheng Yuecheng encouraged him, saying, "Go! Good child, don't forget the suffering you endured before, and remember the happiness you are now enjoying, and also remember the hatred for the Japanese devils who killed your father. Fight the enemy even more fiercely than others."

    Four days after Guo Chunlong left, the Chinese People's Volunteers crossed the river, and the war situation immediately changed. The battle lines shifted south, and the undertaking continued production as usual. However, there was no news from Guo Chunlong. The victories at the front comforted Zheng Yuecheng, but she worried about her son day and night.

    In April 1951, Zheng Yuecheng received a letter from her son from the front lines, and she had someone read it to her repeatedly. From that moment on, she firmly remembered two sentences from her son's letter: "Don't worry about me, work harder to support the front." From that moment on, she also understood that the relationship between herself and her son was one of front and rear. At that time, the undertaking was arranging to rush the repair of the Jialin Bridge. She worked with the men, carrying wood and pouring cement. She did the heavy work just like everyone else, and the fine work as well as two people. As a result, she overfulfilled her task by 280 percent and received a "Merit Medal." She not only demanded that she do her work better, but she also paid special attention to the people she worked with. When Jin Changxie's family ran out of rice and couldn't come to work, she gave him the one and a half dou of rice that the work unit had issued to her. When Li Bingdou had no shoes and worked barefoot, she gave him her newly received rubber shoes. In three months, she helped her fellow workers twelve times. She won the respect of all the workers and their families in the work area.

    In the trials of war, Zheng Yuecheng became stronger and felt younger. In July 1951, because she could not understand her son's letters, she decided to learn to read. It so happened that the work area summary meeting awarded her a book called "Lenin," which increased her desire for knowledge. The next day, she bought paper and pen and began to learn to read.

    In early August, Zheng Yuecheng received another letter, but the handwriting was unlike her son's usual letters. Her heart jumped: "Could something have happened?" After opening it and having someone read it, it turned out to be a commendation letter from a certain unit of the People's Army: Guo Chunlong had shot down six enemy planes in four months and had been awarded the "First-Class National Flag Medal." Zheng Yuecheng was overjoyed. Soon, her son's letter also arrived, the letter paper was a drawing: a soldier holding the trigger of an anti-aircraft gun with both hands, and in the upper left corner, six American planes with smoke billowing out of their rear ends were tumbling. Next to it was a line: "Mom, look at my hand!"

    Her son's deeds encouraged Zheng Yuecheng. She took bigger strides carrying wood, swung the iron hammer more forcefully, and studied even harder. People often saw the light on in her room past midnight.

    In the winter of 1951, Guo Chunlong unexpectedly received a letter written in his mother's own hand. Looking at the crooked handwriting and imagining the effort his mother had put into writing the letter, he gained extra strength. He immediately wrote back to his mother: "Mom, you have already learned to write letters, I can't fall behind." At the end of the year, Guo Chunlong and his comrades shot down nine more enemy planes.

    Every victory at the front excited the hearts of the people in the rear, and Zheng Yuecheng could not lag behind. April was considered spring, but the mountainous area was still a world of snow. At this time, the undertaking was to build a railway between Jialinli and Limingshui, and the women's team led by Zheng Yuecheng went to work. It was the first time that women had independently undertaken a complete set of heavy work. In the first ten days of work, almost everyone in Zheng Yuecheng's team had arm injuries, but only eight blast holes had been drilled. Calculating it, this was equivalent to only ten days of work for one male worker. The work area leader came to Zheng Yuecheng and wanted to send four male workers to help. Zheng Yuecheng was anxious, but she wanted the leadership to believe in them. She excitedly said to the women in the team: "Others at the front can shoot down planes in the sky, how can we not break a few dead stones? The later this railway is completed by one day, the later the millions of tons of sleepers, poles, and tunnel supports from Baitoushan will be transported to where they are needed. We must work harder to win glory for women!" On the spot, everyone decided that each person would drill four feet in the morning and three feet in the afternoon. On the first day, Zheng Yuecheng exceeded the quota by one foot, and on the second day, the entire team exceeded the quota. At the end of the work, this team completed the task two days ahead of schedule, and the winning red flag of the entire work area fell on Zheng Yuecheng's team. Zheng Yuecheng also received the Third-Class National Flag Medal.

    This year, Zheng Yuecheng has been responsible for the road maintenance work in the Jialinli section. After the armistice, she received another letter from her son, which said: The enemy is talking about peace with us, but we must guard against their lack of sincerity. Therefore, as long as the enemy does not abandon its aggressive intentions, I will not lay down my arms for a single day. I hope that my mother and all the people in the rear will use better work achievements to restore and build the motherland. Zheng Yuecheng is responding to her son's hopes with action. By September 4th, she had completed the annual task. Now, she is already doing "New Year's work" - the work for 1954.

    母与子
    殷楚经
    我要叙述的是一个普通的朝鲜母亲和一个普通的朝鲜孩子。母亲的名字叫郑月成，孩子的名字叫郭淳龙。郑月成二十四岁上死了丈夫，当时郭淳龙只有四岁。郑月成就带着孩子给人家做杂工，日子过得像郑月成说的“一天赚了一天吃，有了吃的没穿的”。解放了，母子才第一次尝到真正人的生活的滋味。不久，郑月成参加了佳林里白头山森林铁道建设事业所的工作，光景一天比一天好起来。可是，战争来了。一九五○年的十月，敌人逼近了鸭绿江边的惠山郡，侵略者的炮声威胁着她们母子充满希望的生活。郭淳龙这时才十七岁，已经是民主青年同盟的盟员，简直像个成人。可是他的年龄和体重还不够参军的标准。他想：“不到前线，不算青年。”左思右想，十月二十那天，他把墨水泼在自己的出生证上，把十七岁改成十九岁，贴身又带了几块石头，到普天堡登记参军了。当天晚上又赶回家中来告别他的母亲。郑月成鼓励他说：“走吧！好孩子，不要忘记前头受的苦，更要记着现在享的福，也要记着日本鬼子打死你爹的仇，打敌人要比别人还狠些。”
    郭淳龙走后的第四天，中国人民志愿军就过了江，战局马上起了变化，战线南移了，事业所里照常生产。可是郭淳龙却一直无音讯，前方的胜利安慰着郑月成，可也为儿子日日夜夜担着心。
    一九五一年四月，郑月成接到一封信，是儿子从前线来的，她要别人把信反复地读给她听。从这时候起，她牢牢记住了儿子信上的两句话：“不要挂念我，要多干些活来支援前方。”从这时候起，她也懂得了自己和儿子的关系是前方和后方的关系。当时，事业所正布置赶修佳林桥，她和男人们一起，扛木头，灌水泥，粗活与别人同样干，细活顶得上两个人，结果，她超额完成任务百分之二百八十，获得了“功劳章”。她不仅要求自己把工作作得更好，同时，她也特别关心和她一起工作的人了。金昌爕家没有了米，不能上工，她便把所内发给她的一斗五升米送去；李炳斗没有鞋穿打赤脚上工，她就把自己新领的胶鞋给他。三个月中间，她帮助了和她在一起工作的同志有十二次。她博得了全工区的工人和工属们的尊敬。
    在战争的锻炼中，郑月成变得更加坚强，心情也更加年轻了。一九五一年七月，她因看不懂儿子的来信，决心要学文化。正好工区总结会上奖给她一本名叫“列宁”的书，求知的欲望更增长了，第二天，她就买了纸和笔，开始认字。
    八月初，郑月成又接到了一封信，可是字迹却不像平时儿子的来信，她心跳起来：“不会发生什么事吧！”拆开让别人一看，原来是人民军某部写给她的报功信：郭淳龙在四个月当中打落了六架敌机，获得了“一级国旗勋章”。郑月成好不高兴。很快，她儿子的信也来了，信纸是一幅图画：一个战士双手紧扣着高射炮的板机，左角上，六架美国飞机带着一屁股的烟在翻筋斗。旁边一行字是：“妈妈，你看看我的手！”
    儿子的事迹鼓舞着郑月成，扛木头的步子跨得更大了，铁锒头在她手里挥得更有力了，学习也更勤了，人们常常看到她屋子里的灯开过半夜。
    一九五一年的冬天，郭淳龙意外地接到一封他母亲亲笔写的信。看着那歪歪斜斜的笔迹，想像母亲给他写信时那种吃力的情景，他格外增加了力量，他立即给母亲写了回信：“妈妈，你已经学会写信了，我，更不能落后。”年底，郭淳龙又和他的战友一起打落了九架敌机。
    前线任何一个胜利，都在激动着后方人民的心，郑月成更不能后人。四月算是春天了，山区还是雪的世界。这时，事业所要在佳林里和鲤明水之间修筑铁路，郑月成带领的妇女小组上了工，妇女单独干成套的重活，这还是破天荒的事。开工的头十天，郑月成小组几乎每个人的手臂都带了伤，可是打出的炮眼只有八个，合算一下，只抵得上一个男工十天的工作量。工区长来找郑月成，要派四个男工来帮助。郑月成一面着急，一面要领导上相信她们。她激动地对小组的妇女们说：“别人在前方能打下天上的飞机，我们怎的不能打几块死石头。这段铁路迟修通一天，白头山的千万吨枕木、电杆、坑道支柱就迟一天运到需要的地方，我们得加油为妇女争光呀！”当场大家规定，每天每人上午打眼四尺，下午打眼三尺。第一天，郑月成就超过一尺，第二天，全组都超过了定额。工作结束时，这个组提前两天完成任务，全工区的优胜红旗落在郑月成小组，郑月成又获得了三级国旗勋章。
    今年，郑月成担任了佳林里地段的养路工作。停战后，她又接到了儿子的来信，信上说：敌人和我们谈和平，可要防他未必有诚意。因此，敌人一天不打消侵略企图，我就一天不放下武器，希望母亲和所有后方的人，用更好的工作成绩来恢复和建设祖国。郑月成用行动回答着儿子的希望。到九月四日，她已完成了全年任务。现在，她做的已是“过年活”——一九五四年的工作了。
