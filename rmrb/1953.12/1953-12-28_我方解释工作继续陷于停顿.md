Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 27th: The Korean-Chinese side's explanation work continues to be stalled. The Korean-Chinese side has submitted to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission this morning the plan to conduct explanations tomorrow to the 250 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war in Camp No. 4 who have not listened to explanations.

Due to the U.S. side's unreasonable insistence on terminating the explanation work on the 23rd and opposing the supplementing of the ninety-day explanation period, the Korean-Chinese side's explanation work has been interrupted. The Korean-Chinese side has repeatedly pointed out that the U.S. side's absurd assertion is a malicious distortion of the "scope of authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," and its purpose is to deprive more than 20,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war of the opportunity to listen to explanations and apply for repatriation, so as to forcibly detain them and transfer them to the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee gangs to serve as cannon fodder.

    我方解释工作继续陷于停顿
    【新华社开城二十七日电】朝中方面的解释工作继续陷于停顿。朝中方面已在今天上午把明天向第四号营场未听解释的二百五十名中国人民志愿军被俘人员进行解释的计划交给中立国遣返委员会。
    由于美方无理坚持在二十三日终止解释工作和反对补足九十天解释期限，朝中方面的解释工作已陷于中断。朝中方面已经一再指出：美方的这种荒谬主张是对“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的恶意歪曲，其目的是剥夺二万多名朝中战俘听取解释和申请遣返的机会，以便强迫扣留他们，并把他们移交给蒋介石和李承晚匪帮充当炮灰。
