    Reading "People of the Stalin Era"
    By Zi Gang
    "People of the Stalin Era" by Boris Polevoi, translated by Jin Ren, Lin Xiu, Zhang Menghui, and Liu Liaoyi, published by Writers Publishing House

    I

    The first project of communist construction in the Soviet Union was the Lenin Volga-Don Canal, named after Lenin. It was completed at the end of May last year and opened to navigation in July. We have seen its documentary film. This canal, 101 kilometers long, with thirteen giant electrically automated locks, fulfilled the dreams of the Russian people for centuries: Mother Volga and Father Don finally met. The completion of this canal made the five seas of the European part of the Soviet Union navigable: the White Sea, the Baltic Sea, the Caspian Sea, the Sea of Azov, and the Black Sea were forever connected. This great waterway is different from previous water conservancy projects in the Soviet Union: it not only solves one task but also solves three tasks simultaneously: transportation, power, and irrigation. The grand scale of this engineering technology is unprecedented, which is equivalent to a successful experiment for other construction projects being carried out in the Soviet Union. The people who participated in the construction of this waterway have now dispersed to other construction sites.

    Boris Polevoi's "People of the Stalin Era," consisting of thirty-five short stories, describes the lives and inner worlds of the heroic people who participated in the construction of this communist project. These are all ordinary Soviet people, but precisely because the Soviet Union is transitioning from socialism to communism, its people are also filled with noble communist sentiments. As the author said, these people seem to have transcended the era and have already learned to live and think according to communist standards.

    II

    The working people are the creators of history. The construction of the Lenin Canal attracted the broad masses of the Soviet people like a magnet attracts iron.

    Outstanding soldiers of the Great Patriotic War came: for example, Dmitry Slepukha, a famous tank driver of the Ural Tank Corps, regarded participating in the canal construction as the highest reward; the three members of the Communist Youth League in "Relay Race" had served in the fleet and came to the canal construction site by coincidence, working as dangerous divers in the rapids of the Don River, inheriting the glory of the Communist Youth League District Committee Secretary who sacrificed here in the ice cave during the Great Patriotic War; Aleksey Izmalov, a retired lieutenant of the tank corps, came to the canal construction site as the chief mechanic of a dredger. There were many, many more demobilized soldiers on the construction site.

    Many experienced engineers also came: for example, the engineer Pastukhov, who unexpectedly received tree seeds sent by Young Pioneers; Ivanitsky, the construction director of the dredging machinery section, who called himself "drifting with the wind," and his family moved with the project, never settling in one place. The young engineer Uskov had just received a first-class diploma from the university when he encountered the construction of the Lenin Canal. He gave up the invitation to work in a quiet design bureau and came to the construction site of the great waterway. In order to strive to be a qualified son of Stalingrad, Uskov had studied hard since childhood and had also been wounded in the fierce battles to defend his hometown.

    Many women and children also came: "Little Rabbit" Valeria was only seventeen years old, supplying books on the construction site, running on foot in blizzards. She lent everyone books for studying Marxism-Leninism, novels, and textbooks. Many people on the construction site were preparing reports, theses, or preparing for high school graduation exams after work. Masha and Zoya, two female welders, were careful and cautious in their work, and their work gradually became an art; they were respected by their partners for their technical creativity. Konstantin Yermolenko, a trainee, had just finished the sixth grade and traveled a long way to find the construction site, even if it was just to be a trainee for the summer; as a result, because he had a smart head, he almost became a confidential staff member and could be a competent guide for guests who came to the construction site. The female engineer Kovalyova wanted to attract her girlfriend Lida from the Moscow Research Institute to the canal construction site, but unexpectedly Lida telegraphed back from the Turkmen Main Canal construction site, also inviting Kovalyova to go. Greta Ivanovna had just graduated from the School of Architecture and became the construction director of the lock. At first, she was inevitably flustered, but gradually, she learned to find new methods in her work and was also good at organizing work. Some family members of the project personnel also chose the canal construction site for the benefit of the people.

    The reason why the communist project was able to attract the Soviet people so much was, on the one hand, due to the call of the great ideal: they regarded the victory of the communist construction project as the victory of peace, as a manifestation of the Soviet people's strength, and as proof that they could not only conquer the enemy but also conquer nature. On the other hand, it was due to the Soviet people's love for creative labor. Communist construction used the crystallization of human wisdom—the great power of machines. Twenty years ago, it took tens of thousands of people to dig a canal, but now, there are not many people on the construction site, some in the cabin of the excavator, and some in the cabin of the dredger. The author Boris Polevoi once saw the fact that only one duty engineer was managing the electrical control panel in three concrete supply factories. However, this does not mean that the entire construction project is very easy. In the early stages of the project, they also had to live in tents, and sometimes transportation was difficult, and equipment arrived late, so they had to use pickaxes, shovels, and handcarts. The engineers who were accustomed to the Moscow subway project came here to open channels in the grasslands and had to endure the howling wind and snow on the grasslands, but they were willing to become the leaven of this new work and raise the whole dough. The adventure of the high-altitude installer Pyotr Sinitsyn in "Contribution" wrapping the broken power line over the high altitude of the river surface requires a highly selfless spirit of courage.

    The grand scale of the communist construction project is like a myth, and it is difficult for engineers in capitalist countries to believe it, but the facts make them no longer doubt it. The communist builders and soldiers—the Soviet people—are a new type of human being, and their lofty spirit of fighting and working for the motherland has reached such a moving height. In the article "Dream," the young man ran from the agricultural machinery station to the construction site to do installation work. He hoped to bring the "sea" to the people in his hometown and bring new knowledge back, not to "make a lot of money," as some friends suspected him of. Here, men and women, old and young, have all given up their stable work and life in the city and come to the construction site to engage in the struggle to overcome difficulties. Their creation has freed this vast territory from the threat of drought and dry winds, and has rationally accepted the water sent to the fields, and the irrigation system of the Stalingrad Region and the Rostov Region has been transformed. Labor has truly become a glorious cause, an honorable cause, a heroic and valiant cause.

    While portraying the communist builders working (and even dedicating themselves) for the great ideal, Boris Polevoi comprehensively depicts the noble thoughts and feelings of these characters. The joy and sorrow in their lives are brand new. The article "Sea Avenue" writes about the Soviet people's forward-looking spirit and love for tomorrow: the sea has not yet appeared, and water is still very difficult, but in this village of the collective farm on the grassland, there are already names such as "Coastal Street" and "Sea Avenue." People know that names are not given for nothing, and the Tsimlyansk Sea will flow here in the spring. The article "Little Rabbit" allows us to understand that the people on the construction site never forget to study at any time and never forget to improve their cultural level. The little girl got fifteen books on historical materialism for those who are doing research work. "Seeking Medical Treatment" writes about the Soviet people's love for life. "Prehistoric Mammoth" writes about the workers on the construction site's concern for paleontology. "Letter to Future Generations" vividly depicts the admirable and lovely feelings of the communist builders. They use collective wisdom to leave a letter to future generations, telling them how these epoch-making buildings were built. "In the Fog" truthfully writes about the feelings of two women, reflecting their husbands' high enthusiasm for the cause of communist construction, and also showing their own lovely qualities of being good at obeying the interests of the people. "Happy Voyage" writes about the happy voyage of the old helmsman, who personally guided the "Joseph Stalin" ship into the canal estuary and into the lock. The joy of the helmsman and his apprentice, and the joy of tens of millions of Soviet people, constitute the highest peak of communist joy.

    III

    The Soviet Union is the hope of the people of the world, the Soviet Union is the teacher of the people of the world, and the Soviet Union has increased the confidence of the people of the world in victory in the struggle.

    Through the first and last few articles of "People of the Stalin Era," Boris Polevoi proved this truth from the experiences of the people of Greece, Hungary, and the United Kingdom, and the experiences of the Soviet female worker Maria abroad. A black man in Budapest said to Maria, a Soviet textile worker:

    "...All of you Soviet people are our teachers. We strive to learn everything from you—thought, life, and fighting for peace."

    Maria encountered the same thing in the East and West of the world: treating the Soviet people as teachers reminded her of Stalin's words: any ordinary Soviet citizen is a head taller than any high-ranking foreign official who wears the shackles of capitalist slavery on his shoulders!

    Life educated the Greek woman Panalope, a housewife who raised children at home and planted roses in a small garden. She suffered from the disasters of Hitler's bandits and royalist thugs, was once frightened by the head of her husband sent by the enemy, and once endured the news of her son's sacrifice. She once led her daughter to fight for freedom; to escape the enemy, she sat in a dry well for several months, with royalists wearing American military uniforms above the well. This Greek woman recalled the Soviet works she had read, gained help and courage, and felt that the Soviet people shone like stars on her, and sooner or later the truth would be victorious in her motherland.

    The old British woman also placed her hopes on the Soviet Union. She was also a person who lost her husband and son in the war. The ancient silver coin did not bring happiness to her son as the legend said. She gave her son's memorial to the Soviet representative, believing that the children of the Soviet Union were happy.

    The Soviet people and their peaceful construction cause under the leadership of the Lenin and Stalin Party shine on mankind, penetrating some artificial mists and natural barriers. People from all corners of the world yearn for this bright star.

    IV

    Our country is gradually transitioning to socialism. Under the beacon of the general line in the transitional period, tens of thousands of new figures are constantly emerging in the life fields of national socialist industrialization and socialist transformation. Our writers should also truthfully and comprehensively write about their achievements, thoughts, and feelings, especially the new socialist qualities that are budding in them, and how they treat the things around them; make them the protagonists in literary works, use them to expand their influence, and let the broad masses of readers learn from them. It is necessary to make our readers gain confidence in the inevitable victory of the great cause of socialism from such works and have the courage to overcome any difficulties with vitality.

    "People of the Stalin Era" is kind to us. We will be inspired and encouraged from here. Let similar articles appear more in our newspapers and magazines.

    读“斯大林时代的人”
    子冈
    苏联  鲍·波列伏依作金人、林秀、张孟恢、刘辽逸译  作家出版社出版
    一
    苏联的共产主义建设的第一个工程就是以列宁命名的列宁伏尔加河—顿河运河。它是在去年五月底完成，七月通航的。我们曾看到过它的纪录影片。这条全长一百零一公里，有十三座用电力自动操纵的巨大水闸的运河，把俄罗斯人民多少世纪以来的梦想实现了：伏尔加妈妈和顿河爸爸终于会了面。这条运河的完成，使得苏联欧洲部分的五个大海通航了，白海、波罗的海、里海、亚速海、及黑海永远地连结在一起。这条伟大的水道不同于苏联以往的水利建设：它不只是解决一项任务，而是同时解决三项任务：运输的、动力的和灌溉的任务。这个工程技术规模的宏大是前所未有的，这等于为苏联正进行着的其他建设工程进行了一次成功的实验。参加建设这条水道的人们现在又分散到其他工地去了。
    波列伏依的“斯大林时代的人”里的三十五个短篇，就是描写参加建设这一项共产主义工程的英雄人们的生活和他们的内心世界。这都是些普通的苏维埃人，但正因为苏联已在由社会主义向共产主义过渡，它的人民也是洋溢着崇高的共产主义情绪的人民。如同作者所说，正是这些人，好像是超越了时代，已经学会以共产主义的标准来生活和思考了。
    二
    劳动人民是历史的创造者。列宁运河的建设像磁石吸铁似地把广大的苏联人民吸引过来了。
    伟大卫国战争中卓越的战士们来了：例如有名的乌拉尔坦克军团的坦克驾驶员德米特里·斯列普哈中尉把参加运河建设工作当作最高的奖赏；“接力赛跑”里的三个青年团员在舰队中服务过，不约而同地来到了运河工地，他们在顿河的急流中作着危险的潜水工作，用他们劳动的光荣继承了在卫国战争中牺牲在这儿的冰窟窿里的青年团区委会书记的战斗的光荣；复员的坦克部队中尉阿历克赛·伊兹马洛夫到运河工地上来当了吸泥船的机工长。工地上的复员战士还有很多很多。
    许多有经验的工程师也来了：例如意外地收到少年先锋队队员们寄来的树木种籽的工程师派斯土霍夫；自称是“随风飘”的挖泥机务科的工务主任伊凡尼茨基，他和他的家庭随了工程转移，从来不钉牢在一个地方。青年工程师乌斯科夫刚从大学获得优等毕业证书，就碰上列宁运河的建设，他放弃了工作安静的设计局的邀请，到伟大航路的工地上来。为了争取做一个合格的斯大林格勒的儿子，乌斯科夫自小学习优秀，也曾在保卫故乡的激战中负过伤。
    许多妇女和少年儿童也来了：“小兔子”华丽亚才十七岁，在工地上供应图书，在暴风雪里徒步奔跑，她给大家借研究马克思列宁主义的书，小说、教科书。工地上很多人在歇工以后准备报告、论文、或是要参加中学毕业考试。玛莎和卓娅这两个女电焊工，在工作中仔细谨慎，她们的工作渐渐地变成了艺术；她们在技术上有了创造而受到伙伴们的尊重。见习生康斯坦丁·叶尔莫连珂刚读完六年级，远道找到工地上来，那怕是当一个暑假的见习生也好；结果因为他有一个聪明的脑袋，几乎成了机要工作人员，可以替来到工地上的客人当称职的向导。女工程师科伐蓼娃想吸引她的女友丽达从莫斯科研究院到运河工地上来，想不到丽达从土库曼大运河工地上复了电报，也邀科伐蓼娃去。格丽塔·伊凡诺夫娜刚从建筑学院毕业，就当了水闸的工务主任，起初未免张惶失措，逐渐地，她学会在工作中找寻新办法，也善于做组织工作了。一些工程人员的家属们，也为了人民的利益选择了运河工地。
    共产主义工程所以能够这样地吸引苏联人民，一方面是由于伟大的理想的召引：他们把共产主义建设工程的胜利当作和平的胜利，当作苏联人民实力雄厚的表现，当作不只能征服敌人、也能征服自然的明证。另一方面是由于苏联人民热爱创造性的劳动。共产主义建设运用了人类智慧的结晶——机器的伟大力量，二十年前苏联开凿一条运河时还要用人力千千万万，但是现在，工地上的人是不多的，有的在掘土机的座棚里，有的在吸泥船的驾驶室内。作者波列伏依曾经看见过供应混凝土的三个工厂只有一个值班工程师在管理电气控制台的事实。但是，这并不是说全部建设工程十分轻快。工程初期也要住帐篷，有时运输困难、设备来得迟，也得使用十字镐、铁锹和手车。作惯了莫斯科地下铁道工程的工程师来到这里的草原开河道，也得饱听草原上风雪怒号，但是他们愿意成为这项新工作的酵头，把整个面团发起来。像“贡献”一篇里的高空安装工彼得·西尼津的冒险缠裹河面高空的断电线，就更需要高度忘我的勇敢精神了。
    共产主义建设工程的宏大规模像神话，是很难使资本主义国家的工程师们相信的，但是事实使他们不能再怀疑。共产主义建设者和战士——苏维埃人，是新型的人类，他们为祖国战斗和劳动的崇高精神，达到了这样感人的高度。在“梦”这一篇里，青年小伙子从农业机器站跑到工地作安装工作，他希望把“海”带到家乡人身边去，把新知识带回去，而不是为了“挣大钱”，像个别朋友那么怀疑他的。这里的男女老少，都是放下了城市中安定的工作和生活，到工地上从事克服困难的斗争。他们的创造使得这片广大领土免受旱灾和干风的威胁，而且合理地接受送到田野里来的水分，斯大林格勒州和罗斯多夫州的灌溉系统得到了改造。劳动真正变成光荣的事业、荣耀的事业、豪迈而英勇的事业了。
    波列伏依在表现共产主义建设者们为伟大的理想而劳动（甚至献身）的时候，多方面地描绘了这些人物的高尚的思想感情。他们生活中的欢乐与忧戚是崭新的。“海大道”一篇里写出了苏维埃人向前看的精神和对于明天的热爱：海还没有出现，水还十分困难，但是在这草原上的集体农庄的村子里已经有了“滨海街”、“海大道”这类的名字。人们知道，名字是不会白起的，齐姆良海春天就会流到这儿。“小兔子”一篇使我们了解工地上的人们随时没有忘记学习，没有忘了文化水平的提高，小姑娘给作研究工作的人搞到了十五本研究历史唯物论的书。“求医”里写出了苏维埃人对于生命的热爱。“史前巨象”写工地上的工人对于古生物学的关心。“给后代的信”生动地描绘出共产主义建设者们可敬可爱的感情。他们运用集体智慧想给幸福的后代留一封信，告诉他们这些开天辟地的建筑物是怎么搞起来的。“雾中”真实地写出了两个女人的心情，反映了她们的丈夫们对于共产主义建设事业的高度热中，也表现了她们自己善于服从人民利益的可爱品质。“幸福的航程”写了老舵手的幸福的航行，他亲手把“约瑟夫·斯大林”号轮船引进运河河口，开进了水闸，舵手师徒的欢欣，千千万万苏联人民的欢欣，构成了共产主义欢乐的最高峰。
    三
    苏联是全世界人民的希望，苏联是全世界人民的教师，苏联增加了全世界人民在斗争中对胜利的信心。
    通过“斯大林时代的人”的首尾几篇，波列伏依从希腊、匈牙利、英国的人民的体会和苏联女工玛丽亚在国外的经历证明了这个真理。一个黑人在布达佩斯对苏联的纺织女工—玛丽亚说：
    “……所有你们苏联人都是我们的教师。我们努力跟你们学习一切——思想，生活，为和平而斗争。”
    玛丽亚在世界的东方西方碰到同样的事：把苏联人民当作教师，这使得她想起斯大林的话：任何一个最普通的苏联公民，都比任何一个两肩套着资本主义奴役枷锁的高高在上的外国官吏高出一头！
    生活教育了希腊妇人潘娜洛裴，这个在家里教养孩子、在小花园里种玫瑰花的家庭主妇身受过希特勒强盗和保皇党匪徒的祸害，曾经被敌人送来的丈夫那颗头颅吓昏过，曾经忍受过儿子牺牲的消息。她曾经带了女儿为自由而战斗；为了躲避敌人，她在枯井里坐了几个月，井上面是穿美式军装的保皇党。这个希腊妇人回想起她读过的苏联作品，获得了帮助和勇气，觉得苏联人民像星星一样照耀着她，早早晚晚真理也要在她的祖国获得胜利。
    那个英国老妇人也是把希望寄托在苏联，她也是在战争中失去丈夫和儿子的人，古老的银币并没有按照传说那样给她儿子带来幸福，她把儿子的纪念物送给苏联代表，相信苏联的孩子才是幸福的。
    苏联人民和他们在列宁、斯大林党的领导下所从事的和平建设事业照耀着人类，穿透一些人为的雾幛和自然的隔阂，人们从世界的各个角落向往着这颗光亮的星。
    四
    我国正在逐步过渡到社会主义。在过渡时期总路线的灯塔照耀下，在国家社会主义工业化和进行社会主义改造的生活领域中，千万个新的人物正不断涌现。我们的作家也应该把他们的功绩、思想和感情真实地、多方面地写出来，特别是在他们身上萌芽的新的、社会主义的品质，他们如何对待周围的事物方面；使他们成为文艺作品中的主人翁，用来扩大他们的影响，让广大读者来效法他们。要使得我们的读者从这样的作品中获得社会主义的伟大事业的必然胜利的信心，具有生气勃勃地克服任何困难的勇气。
    “斯大林时代的人”对我们是亲切的。我们将会从这里得到启发和鼓舞。让我们的报纸杂志上也多多出现类似的文章吧。
