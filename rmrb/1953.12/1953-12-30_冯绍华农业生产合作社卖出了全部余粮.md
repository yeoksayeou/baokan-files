    Feng Shaohua Agricultural Production Cooperative Sells All Surplus Grain
    By Our Correspondent Xing Huan
    Under the guiding light of the general line for the transition period, the Feng Shaohua Agricultural Production Cooperative in Sihezhuang, Sixth District, Tong County, Hebei Province, took the lead in selling all its surplus grain to support national industrial construction.
    The Feng Shaohua Cooperative has a total of fifty-nine households (all ten party members in the village have joined the cooperative), with a total of 904.75 mu of land. After deducting 225 mu of cotton and several mu of vegetable plots, the total grain production this year was 172,813 jin. The cooperative paid 23,175 jin of public grain and has now sold 30,283 jin to the state, with the two totaling over 30 percent of the total grain production.
    Why are the members of the cooperative so enthusiastic about selling such a large amount of surplus grain to the state?
    Initially, the work team publicized the general line to everyone. Upon hearing how good socialism is, and learning that their current cooperative is semi-socialist in nature, and is moving towards socialism step by step, everyone was very excited. Many people said, "We did the right thing!" "We never thought we had already entered the door of socialism. In the future, we must work harder so we can live a good life of 'upstairs and downstairs, with electric lights and telephones' sooner." Female cooperative member Yu Shurong said, "Only a few years after the land reform, capitalism has sprouted and grown in our village again. If we don't carry out socialist transformation, we will be like the past, the poor will be poor, and the rich will be rich. This won't do!" The young people all expressed their desire to study culture diligently, "to prepare to drive tractors in the future"; the elderly were calculating whether they would live long enough to see it. Everyone was full of confidence in the bright future of socialism. At this time, the work team also explained to the cooperative members the benefits of national industrialization for farmers. Everyone had a deep understanding of this from their daily life and production: before liberation, one dou of corn could only buy two and a half chi of blue cloth, but now it can buy four chi; last year, one jin of kerosene cost 5,600 yuan, but now it only costs 4,000 yuan; last year, a cast iron pot cost more than 30,000 yuan, but this year it only costs 16,800 yuan… Last year, the state-owned Shuangqiao Farm used tractors to plow 110 mu of land for the cooperative, and this year it plowed 160 mu; in the past, if crops had insects, they could only be caught by hand, but this year, when the cooperative's corn had stem borers, they could use sprayers to apply "666" pesticide powder; in the past, only old and broken plows could be used for farming, but in the past two years, new walking plows could be used. All of these were manufactured by the worker brothers, and are also the result of the initial development of national industry.
    When the work team was conducting propaganda among the peasants, urging them to support national construction by enthusiastically selling their surplus grain to the state, some cooperative members' enthusiasm began to decline, and many people said, "Socialism is good, but I don't have any surplus grain." In fact, it was not that they had no surplus grain, but mainly that some problems could not be figured out. In addition to carrying out propaganda and explanations targeting these ideological concerns, the cadres of the work team also adopted the method of recalling and comparing the past to enlighten the peasants' awareness. By recalling their past poor lives, comparing them to the good life of eating enough and wearing warm clothes now, and thinking about the happy life in the future, some people connected their personal future with the bright future of the country, and their thinking suddenly became clear. For example, Chen Fusheng, a Communist Party member who had carried work for landlords and worked short-term jobs, recalled that in the past, his two brothers worked early and late for the landlord, and the whole family could not eat enough or wear warm clothes. After liberation, he turned over, was allocated land, and Chairman Mao called on them to organize and produce more grain. This year, in addition to having enough for his family of seven to eat, he also had surplus grain. Where did this life come from? Thinking about the fact that he is a Communist Party member, and the ultimate goal of the Communist Party's struggle is to realize communism, now the country calls on farmers to sell surplus grain in order to build a great socialist country. If he doesn't sell his surplus grain, how can he mobilize the masses? If this work is not done well, can the country succeed without enough grain? Can industrialization be realized, and can the good days of socialism arrive? Thinking of this, Chen Fusheng carefully calculated the detailed accounts of his family, that about 420 jin of grain per person per year would be enough to eat, and happily said that he would sell more than 2,800 jin of surplus grain to the state. Li Delu, an old peasant who had turned over and was blind, recalled the past and said, "If it weren't for Chairman Mao, I, a blind man, wouldn't be able to live to this day. In the past, I couldn't wear cotton clothes in winter, just a broken wadded jacket that didn't cover my body, and I was covered in lice, which bit me so that I couldn't sit or stand still. I couldn't eat a few full meals all year round, and it looked like my old life was hopeless. Thanks to Chairman Mao's arrival, I was allocated land and joined the cooperative. This year, without me worrying about it, the grain was distributed to my home in the fall. My old couple has surplus grain in addition to eating. This happiness was brought by Chairman Mao. I must respond to Chairman Mao's call and sell all my surplus 300 jin of grain to the state!"
    With the lead of these active cooperative members, and after their personal experiences were shared and the detailed accounts of their families were calculated, some other cooperative members also had a better understanding and knew how much to keep was enough to eat. At this time, the work team used the fact that prices had been stable for several years since liberation to explain that money would not "depreciate," and publicized the preferential treatment of grain sales and savings to the masses, helping the masses to plan well for next year's production. Once this was done, the knots in the members' hearts were untied, and thirty-six households with surplus grain sold all their surplus grain, more than thirty thousand jin.

    冯绍华农业生产合作社卖出了全部余粮
    本报记者　星环
    在国家过渡时期总路线的灯塔照耀下，河北省通县六区四合庄冯绍华农业生产合作社，带头卖出了全部余粮，支援国家工业建设。
    冯绍华社共五十九户（村里十个党员都参加了合作社），共有土地九百零四点七五亩，除去二百二十五亩棉花和几亩菜地外，今年共产粮食十七万二千八百一十三斤。交纳了公粮二万三千一百七十五斤，现又卖给国家三万零二百八十三斤，两者合计占粮食总产量的百分之三十强。
    为什么该社社员能踊跃地卖出这样大批的多余粮食给国家呢？
    开始，工作组向大家宣传了总路线，大家听说社会主义那么好，又听到他们现在的合作社是半社会主义性质的，现正一步一步地向社会主义走，非常兴奋。不少人说：“咱们算办对了！”“想不到咱们已经走进了社会主义的大门，往后咱们更得加劲努力干，好叫咱早些过上‘楼上楼下，电灯电话’的好日子。”妇女社员于淑荣说：“土地改革刚几年，咱村的资本主义又发芽生叶了，要不实行社会（主义）改造，咱们又得像过去一样，穷的穷，富的富，这可不行啊！”青年们都表示要努力学文化，“准备将来开拖拉机”；老年人则算自己赶的上赶不上。大家对社会主义的光明前途充满了信心。这时，工作组又给社员们讲国家工业化对农民的好处。这方面，大家从日常生活和生产中，体验得很深刻：解放前一斗玉米只能买二尺半青布，现在就可以买到四尺；去年买一斤煤油得五千六百元，现在只要四千元；去年买一口斗子铁锅要三万多元，今年只要一万六千八百元……。去年国营双桥农场使拖拉机给合作社耕了一百一十亩地，今年又给耕了一百六十亩；往年庄稼生了虫只好用手捉，今年社里棒子长了钻心虫，就能使上喷雾器打“六六六”药粉；往年耕地只能使老破犁杖，这二年就能使上新式步犁，这都是工人老大哥制造出来的，也是国家工业初步发展了的结果。
    工作组在对农民进行支援国家建设，要踊跃把余粮卖给国家的宣传时，有的社员的情绪开始低落了，不少人说：“社会主义好是好，可是我没有多余粮食。”其实并不是没余粮，主要是有些问题想不开。工作组的干部除针对着这些思想顾虑，作了宣传、解释外，又采用了回忆对比的方法启发农民的觉悟。一些人通过回忆过去的穷困生活，比比现在吃得饱穿得暖的好日子，想想将来的幸福生活，把个人的前途和国家的美满前途联系了起来，思想一下子通了。如给地主扛过活、打过短工的共产党员陈福生，回想到过去哥儿俩起早睡晚给地主干活，一家大小吃不饱穿不暖的日子，解放后翻了身，分得了土地，毛主席号召组织起来多打了粮食，今年除自己一家七口够吃以外还有余粮，这日子是打那里来的？再想到自己是个共产党员，共产党奋斗的最终目的就是要实现共产主义，现在国家号召农民出卖余粮，就是为了建设伟大的社会主义国家。自己都不卖出余粮来，怎能去动员群众？这工作作不好，国家没有足够的粮食能成吗？能实现工业化，社会主义的好日子能到来吗？想到这些，陈福生仔细算了算自己家里的细账，每人每年大约四百二十斤粮食就够吃了，就愉快地说出了要卖二千八百多斤余粮给国家。双目失明的翻身老农民李德禄，回忆了过去的情况后说：“要不是毛主席，我瞎子那能活到现在。过去我冬天穿不上棉衣，就一件遮不住身的破絮套子，满身都是虱子，咬的我坐立不安，一年到头吃不到几顿饱饭，眼看我这老命就难保了。多亏毛主席来到了，我分了地，又参加了合作社，今年不用我操心，到秋粮食就分到家了，老俩口除吃以外还有余粮，这幸福都是毛主席带来的，我可得响应毛主席的号召，把我多余的三百斤粮食全卖给国家！”
    经过这些积极社员的带头，又经过他们的现身说法，算了他们各人家里的细账，另外一些社员心里也有了底了，知道留多少就够吃了。此时，工作组又用解放几年来物价稳定的事实说明钱不会 “毛”，并向群众宣传了优待售粮储蓄的办法，帮助群众对明年的生产作好打算。这一下社员们心里的疙瘩解开了，三十六户有余粮的社员，全部卖出余粮三十多万斤。
