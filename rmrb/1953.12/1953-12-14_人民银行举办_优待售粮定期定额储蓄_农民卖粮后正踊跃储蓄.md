    People's Bank Launches "Preferential Grain Sales Fixed-Amount Time Deposits"
    Farmers Eagerly Deposit After Selling Grain
    [This Newspaper's News] To meet the demands of farmers who are enthusiastically selling grain to the state and actively planning to use the proceeds from grain sales to expand production next year, the People's Bank of China has launched "Preferential Grain Sales Fixed-Amount Time Deposits" in vast rural areas across the country. This savings method has been widely welcomed by farmers. After purchasing the production materials and daily necessities urgently needed for this winter, many farmers are eagerly depositing their remaining money into banks for use in expanding production next year.
    To provide preferential treatment and convenience to the vast number of farmers selling grain, the "Preferential Grain Sales Fixed-Amount Time Deposits" launched by the People's Bank not only offer favorable interest rates (a monthly interest rate of 1.5% for deposits of one to three months, and 2% for deposits of three to six months), but also simplified procedures. People's Banks in various provinces have established various forms of deposit stations and widely entrusted cooperatives to act as agents for deposit collection and payment, in coordination with grain purchase work. They have also printed "Preferential Grain Sales Savings Fixed-Amount Deposit Slips" to simplify deposit and withdrawal procedures. While instructing its subordinate People's Banks at all levels to promote "Preferential Grain Sales Fixed-Amount Time Deposits," the Head Office of the People's Bank of China requires all localities to adhere to the policy of persuasion and education in carrying out grain sales savings work, and to adhere to the principle of voluntary participation by farmers, and must not adopt simple bundling methods; they should explain to grain-selling farmers the benefits of saving and storing up strength for next year's production investment, in order to inspire farmers' enthusiasm for voluntary savings.
    Currently, People's Banks in various localities are successively launching preferential grain sales savings business and are widely promoting the significance and benefits of savings to farmers. After recognizing the significance and benefits of depositing the remaining money from grain sales into state banks, many farmers have deposited their remaining grain sales funds into banks. The amount of rural savings in banks across various localities is gradually increasing. As of early November, the rural savings balance of the People's Bank of Jiangsu Province increased by 15% compared to the end of September; according to statistics from mid-November, the deposit amount of farmers in early autumn crop areas increased by more than 31% compared to September. By mid-November, the rural savings balance in Shaanxi Province increased by 87% compared to the end of September; among them, Weinan County increased by 277.4%, and Lintong County increased by 128.5%. In Yunmei Township, Eshan County, Yunnan Province, the total grain sales income of farmers in the entire township was more than 25 million yuan, of which about 10 million yuan has been deposited in banks; the money deposited in banks by farmers in Tuguan and Fuquan Townships accounted for more than half of the proceeds from grain sales; 80% of the money obtained by members of the Pujia and Mutual Aid Groups in the Second District after selling surplus grain has been deposited in banks. Farmers in the suburbs of Beijing and Tianjin are also eagerly depositing their remaining grain sales funds into state banks. In Zhangguozhuang Township, Fengtai District, Beijing, in the three days from November 24th to 26th, 66 out of 105 grain-selling households in the entire township deposited 18.65 million yuan into state banks, accounting for 53.8% of the grain purchase funds released in those three days. The Zhangguozhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative collectively sold 8,000 jin of surplus grain to the state and received 9.31 million yuan, all of which was deposited in the bank. The Dongjiao District Office of the Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank of China started the preferential grain sales savings business on November 21st, and as of November 25th, the average daily deposits received were equal to more than 50% of the funds released for grain purchases by the cooperatives. On the first day of handling the preferential grain sales savings work at the Wuben Village Savings Office in the district, farmers deposited more than 80 million yuan, of which depositors with more than 1 million yuan accounted for more than 80%.

    人民银行举办“优待售粮定期定额储蓄”
    农民卖粮后正踊跃储蓄
    【本报讯】现在广大农民正踊跃卖粮食给国家，并积极筹划运用售粮所得现款扩大生产。中国人民银行为了满足农民储存、积累明年扩大生产资金的要求，特在全国广大农村举办“优待售粮定期定额储蓄”。这种储蓄办法已普遍受到农民的欢迎。许多农民在购买了今年冬季急需的生产资料和生活资料后，踊跃把余下的钱存入银行，以便明年成宗使用，扩大生产。
    为了优待、便利售粮的广大农民，人民银行举办的“优待售粮定期定额储蓄”，不仅利息优厚（存款一个月到三个月可得月息一分五厘，三个月到六个月可得月息二分），而且手续简便。各省人民银行已在农村配合购粮工作，增设各种形式的收储站和广泛委托合作社代理收储与兑付，并印制了“优待售粮储蓄定期定额存单”，简化存取手续。中国人民银行总行在指示所属各级人民银行推行“优待售粮定期定额储蓄”的同时，要求各地在开展售粮储蓄工作中，坚持说服教育方针，坚持农民自愿原则，切不可采用简单的搭配方法；应向售粮农民讲明节约储蓄对积蓄明年生产投资力量的好处，以启发农民自愿储蓄的积极性。
    现在，各地人民银行正陆续举办优待售粮储蓄业务，并广泛向农民宣传储蓄的意义和好处。许多农民在认识到把售粮余款向国家银行储蓄的意义和好处以后，纷纷将售粮余款存入银行。各地银行农村储蓄额日渐上升。江苏省人民银行农村储蓄余额，截至十一月上旬，比九月底上升了百分之十五；早秋作物地区农民的存款额，据十一月中旬统计，比九月份上升百分之三十一以上。陕西省全省农村储蓄余额，到十一月中旬止，比九月底上升达百分之八十七；其中渭南县上升百分之二百七十七点四，临潼县上升百分之一百二十八点五。云南省峨山县云美乡，全乡农民卖粮收入共二千五百多万元，已存入银行一千万元左右；土官、富泉两乡农民存入银行的钱占售粮所得款的一半以上；第二区普家和互助组组员们出卖余粮后得到的钱，百分之八十已存入银行。北京、天津市郊区农民，也踊跃将卖粮余款存入国家银行。北京市郊丰台区张郭庄乡，在十一月二十四日到二十六日的三天中，全乡一百零五户售粮农民中，就有六十六户向国家银行储蓄了一千八百六十五万元，占三天购粮投放金额的百分之五十三点八。张郭庄农业生产合作社集体卖给国家八千斤余粮，得到九百三十一万元，全部都存进了银行。中国人民银行天津分行东郊区办事处，从十一月二十一日开始举办优待售粮储蓄业务，截至十一月二十五日，平均每天收到的存款等于合作社购粮投放资金的百分之五十以上。该区务本村储蓄处办理优待售粮储蓄工作的第一天，农民就存入了八千多万元，其中百万元以上的存户占百分之八十以上。
