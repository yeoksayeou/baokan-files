    Sichuan Province's Leshan, Bishan, Peng'an, and Qingchuan Counties conduct socialist education for women in conjunction with grain purchase work, with good results.

    At the beginning of the grain purchase work, in some areas of Sichuan, due to poor education work among women, some women prevented their husbands and sons from selling grain. For example, Xu Tianbao, an activist farmer in Xinhua Village, Nanbu County, wanted to sell grain, but his wife, Xu Li, locked the cabinet where the grain was stored; his mother also said, "If you want to sell grain, go sell it yourself; I don't need you to take care of this family!"

    After the local government and women's federations discovered this situation, they took various measures to strengthen publicity and education for women. Mouzi Township in Leshan County first conducted socialist road education for women cadres; when holding cadre meetings, they absorbed township women representative directors to participate, and invited village women group leaders and women activists to attend. After they understood the important relationship between selling grain and national construction, they became active promoters and organizers of grain selling and purchasing work. Wang Sumei, a woman representative of Shian Village, Qinggang Township, Bishan County, sold 800 jin of grain to the state and used the evenings, noon breaks, and market days to conduct propaganda among mutual aid team members. Women's Director Yang Huafu, after selling his surplus grain, also mobilized farmer Huang Jichang to sell 700 jin of surplus grain. Many women activists also went deep into the women masses, held forums and family meetings, and mobilized women to sell their surplus grain to the state. At a women's forum held in Shian Village, Bishan County, women expressed their willingness to sell their surplus grain to the state and registered their grain sales on the spot; some women said that they would go back to hold family meetings to mobilize their families to sell surplus grain to support national construction. After attending a forum, the wife of Wang Honggui of Huzhu Village, Zhoukou Township, Peng'an County, understood the socialist future of the country and the significance of selling grain, eliminated ideological concerns, and actively supported her husband in selling more than 1,000 jin of surplus grain from their home to the state.

    四川省乐山、璧山、蓬安等县
    结合购粮工作向妇女进行社会主义的教育
    四川省乐山、璧山、蓬安、青川等县，结合购粮工作，对妇女进行社会主义道路的教育，效果良好。
    在购粮工作开始时，四川某些地区由于对妇女的教育工作做得较差，曾发生少数妇女阻挡自己的丈夫和儿子卖粮的现象。如南部县新华村农民积极分子徐天宝要卖粮，可是他的妻子徐李氏却把存粮的柜子锁起来；他的母亲也说：“你要卖粮食你自己去卖，我这个家不用你管！”
    当地政府和妇联组织发现这种情况以后，便采取各种办法加强对妇女的宣传教育。乐山县牟子乡首先对妇女干部进行了社会主义道路的教育；在召开干部会议时，吸收乡妇女代表主任参加，并请各村的妇女组长和妇女积极分子列席。当她们了解了卖粮和国家建设的重大关系以后，就成为卖粮和购粮工作的积极宣传者和组织者。璧山县青杠乡石安村妇女代表王素梅卖给了国家八百斤谷子，并利用晚间、中午和赶场的机会对互助组员进行宣传。妇女主任杨华富卖出自己的余粮后，还动员农民黄吉昌卖了七百斤余粮。许多妇女积极分子还深入到妇女群众中去，召开座谈会和家庭会议，动员妇女把余粮卖给国家。在璧山县石安村召开的妇女座谈会上，妇女纷纷表示要把余粮卖给国家，并当场登记自己的卖粮数；有些妇女表示回去要开家庭会议，动员家庭出卖余粮，支援国家建设。蓬安县周口乡互助村汪洪贵的妻子，经过座谈以后，了解了国家的社会主义前途和卖粮的意义，消除了思想顾虑，积极支持丈夫把家中的一千多斤余粮卖给国家。
