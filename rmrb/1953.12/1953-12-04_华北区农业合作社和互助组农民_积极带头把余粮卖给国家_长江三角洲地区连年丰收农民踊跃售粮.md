Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd: In some rural areas of North China, the state's general line for the transition period has begun to be promoted to farmers. Farmers participating in agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams have taken the lead in selling large quantities of surplus grain to the state, driving individual farmers to sell grain. The Li Genzhu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Huata Village, a suburb of Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province, sold 21,700 jin of grain to the state in one go. The Niu Chouze Mutual Aid Team in Niujiazhuang, Wuxiang, collectively sold 53 shi of grain. After receiving education on the general line, the four mutual aid teams led by Han Ying in the fifth district of Xinxian sold a total of more than 42,600 jin of grain. The Gou Faxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Quzhai Village, Changzhi County, Shanxi Province, overcame the drought this year under the leadership and assistance of local Party and government leaders, achieving a bumper harvest of more than 90 jin per mu compared to last year, and sold more than 13,000 jin of grain to the state in one go. Zhao Huangxi, the head of a mutual aid team in the fifth district of Xinxian, sold more than 10,000 jin of grain to the state. He said, "If we didn't listen to the government and take the road of organization, we wouldn't be able to harvest so much grain. Selling more grain to the state to support construction is beneficial to expanding our production." Geng Changsuo, the nationally renowned agricultural labor model from Raoyang County, Hebei Province, and his agricultural production cooperative achieved increased production this year, with an average yield per mu exceeding that of ordinary local farmers by more than 34 percent. The cooperative members are preparing to sell all 50,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. The Xiaobeijiangu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ninghe County harvested more than 1,030,000 jin of rice this year. In order to respond to the call of the state and prepare for expanding production next year, all members unanimously agreed to sell 840,000 jin of surplus rice to the state.

The enthusiastic grain sales by agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams in various parts of North China have driven ordinary farmers to sell their surplus grain to the state. The exemplary action of the Zhang Zhiquan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dazhai Village, Yushe County, Shanxi Province, in selling a large quantity of wheat to the state has driven farmers throughout the village to enthusiastically sell grain. Zhanghu Village in the second district sold more than 14,000 jin of wheat to the state in just two days, and Cheng Xiwang, a farmer in Beitian Village, sold more than 4,000 jin of wheat to the state alone. In various rural areas of Hebei Province, under the leadership of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, the amount of grain sold by farmers is increasing day by day. Farmers in Xuanhua County are delivering grain to grain stations in batches. For example, more than 90 of the 99 households in Xiaodongzhuang Village sold 240,000 jin of grain to the state. Farmers in Wanghuofang and Xiabali villages in the county have sold more than 300,000 jin of grain to the state. Shen Youcai, the head of a mutual aid team, took the lead in selling 3,500 jin of grain and said, "After I joined the mutual aid team, the grain yield has increased almost doubled compared to the past. We should sell the surplus grain to the state so that the worker brothers can eat their fill, have more energy to work, and manufacture tractors sooner so that we can achieve collectivization and mechanization and produce more grain."

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, December 2nd: The Yangtze River Delta region, spanning two to three hundred li between the Qiantang River and the Yangtze River and around Taihu Lake, has achieved continuous bumper harvests for three years since liberation. This year, the total grain output of the Suzhou Prefecture, Songjiang Prefecture, and Jiaxing Prefecture in Zhejiang Province on the delta has once again broken the historical high level reached last year, with an increase of nearly 700 million jin compared to last year. The grain produced in the three prefectures, in addition to what farmers consume themselves, is sufficient to supply the people of a city as large as Beijing for three years, or can supply the people of an industrial city like Anshan for twenty years.

The Yangtze River Delta is fertile, densely populated, and has a crisscrossing irrigation system centered on Taihu Lake and with the Grand Canal and Suzhou Creek as its main lines. The delta is famous for producing rice. The rice grains are large, soft, fragrant, and nutritious. Thanks to consecutive years of bumper harvests since liberation, the funds farmers have invested in production this year have greatly increased, and the advanced technology of "small seedlings, dense planting" promoted by Chen Yongkang, the national rice production model, has been widely adopted. The summer rice seedlings grew particularly lush and strong. When the rice was flowering and heading, although it did not rain for about two consecutive months and some harbors and streams in the water network area were dry, under the leadership of local Party organizations at all levels and people's governments at all levels, more than one million mutual aid team members and agricultural production cooperative members led all farmers in using more than 330,000 head of cattle and 480,000 waterwheels, organized according to dike head water sources, to draw water day and night to fight the drought, finally achieving victory. Farmers in Xuquan Township, Wuxi County, also used five water pumps to pump water from Taihu Lake over mountains more than ten zhang high, irrigating more than 600 mu of rice fields that were about to dry up, with the help of more than thirty workers. At that time, in addition to the existing 3,500 agricultural water pumps and tens of thousands of water pump workers participating in the drought resistance effort, workers from Shanghai, Wuxi, Suzhou, Jiaxing and many market towns also transferred a large number of manpower and machines to help farmers draw water. The Jiaxing Military Sub-district of the People's Liberation Army also mobilized more than 4,600 commanders, combatants, and many donkeys and horses to support farmers in fighting the drought. Farmers, workers, and PLA commanders and fighters worked side by side to pump water from the Yangtze River and Taihu Lake into the fields, revitalizing the nearly withered rice and achieving an unprecedented bumper harvest in a year of severe drought. When the rice was harvested, the farmers came up with all sorts of ways to reduce losses and strive for a ten-year harvest in a ten-year scene. The rice stalks were cut shorter than in the past, and the action of cutting the rice was also lighter than in the past. Tall farmers carried large bundles of rice stalks home, carefully walking across the field banks and small bridges. Children followed their fathers and brothers, picking up lost ears of rice and putting them into bamboo baskets. The sound of threshers "da da da" could be heard in every village. A rough estimate of the nine counties in Suzhou Prefecture alone shows that an additional 160 million jin of rice could be harvested and saved on the original yield.

Immersed in the joy of a bumper harvest, farmers in the Yangtze River Delta are currently enthusiastically selling their surplus grain to the state. In front of cooperative purchasing stations everywhere, farmers selling grain are noisily seated before dawn. Boats selling grain are endless in large and small river ports. When the boats come, the rice is piled higher than the heads of the people; when the boats leave, they are loaded with means of production and living supplies such as farm tools, fertilizers, cloth, and woolen clothing. Since the beginning of the autumn harvest, the Haiyan County Cooperative has sold more than 900 head of cattle and large and small farm tools worth a total of 550 million yuan. Carpenters and blacksmiths in cities and towns are busy manufacturing farm tools such as hoes and plowshares for farmers.

Although it is still only the early winter season, farmers in the Yangtze River Delta are already preparing for an even greater harvest next year.

    积极带头把余粮卖给国家
    长江三角洲地区连年丰收农民踊跃售粮
    【新华社三日讯】华北部分农村开始向农民宣传了国家在过渡时期的总路线。那些参加农业生产合作社和互助组的农民，首先把大批余粮卖给国家带动个体农民售粮。山西太原市郊区花塔村李根柱农业生产合作社一次就卖给国家粮食二万一千七百斤；武乡牛家庄牛臭则互助组集体售粮五十三石；忻县五区韩英等四个互助组受了总路线的教育后，共售粮四万二千六百多斤；山西省长治县璩寨村苟发兴农业生产合作社今年在当地党、政领导和帮助下，战胜了旱灾，每亩比去年增产九十多斤获得了丰收，一次就卖给国家粮食一万三千多斤。忻县五区互助组长赵黄喜把上万斤的粮食卖给了国家。他说：“我们不是听政府的话走组织起来的路，就不能打这样多的粮食，多卖粮给国家支援建设，对我们扩大生产是有好处的。”河北省饶阳县全国闻名的农业劳动模范耿长锁和他的农业生产合作社，今年获得增产，平均每亩产量超过当地一般农民产量百分之三十四以上，社员们正准备把五万斤余粮全部卖给国家。宁河县小北涧沽农业生产合作社今年收获稻谷一百零三万多斤，全体社员为了响应国家的号召和准备明年扩大生产，一致同意把富余的八十四万斤稻谷卖给了国家。
    华北各地农业生产合作社、互助组踊跃售粮的行动，带动了一般农民把余粮卖给国家。山西省榆社县大寨村张志全农业生产合作社把大宗小麦卖给国家的模范行动，带动了全村农民踊跃售粮。二区张胡村只两天时间就卖给国家小麦一万四千多斤，北田村农民程喜旺一人就卖给国家小麦四千多斤。河北省各地农村在农业生产合作社、互助组的带动下，农民售粮的数量正逐日增加。宣化县农民正把粮食成批的送到收粮站去，如小东庄村九十九户农民中就有九十多户的农民把二十四万斤粮食卖给国家。该县王火房和下八里两村农民卖给国家的粮食已在三十万斤以上，互助组长申有财带头卖了三千五百斤粮食后说：“我参加互助组后，粮食产量比过去提高了差不多一倍，咱们应该把余粮卖给国家，让工人老大哥吃的饱饱的，干活劲头大，早一点制造出拖拉机来，好让咱们集体化和机械化，打更多的粮食。”
    【新华社上海二日电】钱塘江与长江之间、太湖周围纵横二三百里的长江三角洲地区，在解放以来连续三年丰收之后，今年三角洲上的江苏省苏州专区、松江专区和浙江省嘉兴专区的粮食总产量，又突破了去年所达到的历史上的最高水平，比去年增产近七亿斤。三个专区所产的粮食，除农民自己食用外，足够供应像首都北京那样多的人民三年的食用，或者可以供应像工业城市鞍山那样多的人民二十年的食用。
    长江三角洲土地肥沃，人口密集，有以太湖为中心，以南运河、苏州河为干线的蛛网交错的灌溉水系。三角洲上以产稻米著名。米粒壮大，质软味香，营养丰富。由于解放后连年丰收，今年农民们投入生产的资金比过去大为增加，并且普遍地推广了全国水稻丰产模范陈永康的“小株密植”先进技术，夏季秧苗长得特别茂盛茁壮。当稻子扬花吐穗的时候，虽然接连两月左右没有下雨，水网地区有的港汊干旱没水，但在当地中共各级组织和各级人民政府领导下，一百多万户互助组组员和农业生产合作社社员带动了全体农民，使用三十三万多条耕牛和四十八万多部水车，按圩头水源组织起来，昼夜不停地车水抗旱，终于获得胜利。无锡县许泉乡农民还在三十多个工人的帮助下，用五架抽水机把太湖水翻过十多丈高的山岭，灌溉了六百多亩快要干涸的稻田。当时，三角洲上除了原有的三千五百多部农用抽水机和上万抽水机工人参加抗旱外，上海、无锡、苏州、嘉兴等城市和许多集镇的工人，也调出大批人力和机器帮助农民打水。人民解放军嘉兴军分区也动员了四千六百多名指挥员、战斗员和许多驴马，支援农民抗旱。农民和工人、解放军指战员并肩把自长江和太湖的水灌到了田里，使行将枯萎的稻子由此复苏，大旱之年获得空前丰收。在稻子收割时，农民们又想出一切办法减少损耗，争取十成年景十成收。稻秆都比过去割得矮了，割稻的动作也比过去轻了。高个子的农民挑着大捆稻株回家，小心翼翼地走过田岸和小桥。孩子们跟在他们父兄的后面，把丢失的穗头拾到竹篮子里。脱谷机“哒哒哒”的声音村村相闻。仅苏州专区九个县的粗略估计，就可以在原来的产量上多收和节约稻谷一亿六千万斤。
    沉浸在丰收喜悦中的长江三角洲上的农民，目前正踊跃地把余粮卖给国家。各地合作社收购站的门口，天不亮就闹腾腾地坐满了售粮的农民。大小河港中卖粮的船只络绎不绝，船来时稻谷堆得高过人头，船去时载着农具、肥料、布匹、绒衣等生产资料和生活用品。海盐县合作社在秋收开始后已卖出九百多条耕牛，和总值五亿五千万元的大小农具。城市和乡镇上的木工和铁工，都忙着为农民制造锄头、犁铧等农具。
    目前虽然还只是初冬季节，长江三角洲上的农民已在为明年更大的丰收作准备了。
