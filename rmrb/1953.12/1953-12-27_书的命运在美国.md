The Fate of Books in America
By Patrick Goldring, Britain

A list of books that America wants to ban has reached Britain.

The Nazi bandits burned books in order to eliminate the "insidious poison" of communism. Now, communist works have become the primary content of the new book burners' list of banned books.

Goebbels also said that the "insidious poison" of communism might be "hidden under the guise of science and humanity."

The American list of banned books includes Einstein's "Theory of Relativity," Julius H. Hlavaty's "Review Digest in Solid Geometry," and other "un-American" works.

The Nazi bandits slandered Ernest Hemingway, Zola, Thomas Mann, and many other writers as poisonous people cloaked in humanity. Today, the names of these people are also on the list of banned books of the new book burners.

Twenty years ago, Goebbels said: "The position of Jews in academia is over." Today, in the United States, this has become the reason why Einstein's works and the book "Introduction to Psychoanalysis" by the late Jewish scholar Sigmund Freud are being banned.

Several special interest groups, taking advantage of the hysteria caused by Senator McCarthy's espionage activities, burned various works written by people, many of whom openly opposed communism, simply because these people touched on their sore spots once or twice.

The behind-the-scenes power brokers in Congress regarding the China issue are busy. This is a powerful group that wants to drag the United States into a war against China and support Chiang Kai-shek's resurgence. The State Department's banning of books by Far East issue writer Owen Lattimore, the author of "The American Record in the Far East, 1945-51" Kenneth Scott Latourette, and the author of modern Chinese history K. Rosinger is also somewhat related to this group.

The agents under Senator McCarthy not only want to ban books written by progressive writers, but also do not allow those who criticize McCarthy's style to speak out, no matter how much those critics oppose communism.

Therefore, books like Alan Barth's "The Loyalty of Free Man" and Bert Andrews' "Washington Witch Hunt" have been thrown into the fire of book burning.

The list of banned books includes many books written by Jews and about Jews.

For example, Morris U. Schappes's "A Documentary History of the Jews in the United States 1654-1875" is on the list of banned books.

From the extreme South of the United States comes the clamor of another powerful group, the group that hates black people. Books written by black people and books exposing how black people are treated are inevitably included in the list of banned books.

This category includes Lillian Smith's "Strange Fruit," which exposes the terror of lynching, and Doxey A. Wilkerson's "Special Problems of Negro Education."

Black writers such as Walter White and Richard Wright, despite having criticized the Communist Party, still could not save their works from being banned.

The groups conspiring to revive German Nazism do not miss the opportunity to burn books that depict the true face of Nazism.

The books on the list of banned books by these book burners include Lillian Hellman's "Watch on the Rhine" and Albert Maltz's "The Cross and the Arrow."

Who is in power in the United States today? Of course, it is the billionaires... They can influence some of the above-mentioned groups, and at the same time, they hate the public investigating their own wealth the most.

Therefore, Harvey O'Connor's "Mellon's Millions," "The Astors," "Steel Dictator," and "Guggenheims" had to suffer the disaster of being burned.

There is another category of books on the book-burning list that do not cause much dissatisfaction among those in power, but these books are written or illustrated by people that those book burners do not like.

Even Senator McCarthy himself would find it difficult to find any communist "insidious poison" or subversive conspiracy in Dashiell Hammett's "The Thin Man," "The Maltese Falcon," or other moving novels, but because the author of these books does not conceal his sympathy for progressive ideas, Americans are not allowed to read these books.

Only classical works like Chaucer's "Canterbury Tales" and Melville's "Moby Dick" are "loyal" Americans can read with confidence (although currently, people with obvious "bookish habits" will attract the attention of agents).

However, prudent readers should also be careful not to casually pick up versions illustrated by Rockwell Kent in the future. Because Kent is a progressive. Versions with his illustrations are to be banned and burned.

The banning of Edwin Seaver's "Pageant of American Humour" and Louis Untermeyer's "Treasury of American and British Poetry" has made editors fearful.

Books that realistically depict the original face of America are most likely to be included in the list of banned books.

Theodore Dreiser, Erskine Caldwell, James T. Farrell, and John Steinbeck have all committed this "crime" at least once. Although Steinbeck has recently changed his tune, he still cannot save his novel "The Grapes of Wrath" from being banned.

Is Mark Twain "un-American"? For millions of people, his works are indeed American literature. However, some book burners with rudimentary literacy have listed his "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court" as a banned book.

These book burners, like their predecessors, the German Nazi bandits, hate culture. As soon as they hear the word "culture," they reach for their guns.

### 书的命运在美国

专栏：

    书的命运在美国
    英国  帕特里克·高尔德林
    美国要查禁的书籍的名单，有一份到了英国。
    纳粹匪徒们为了要消灭共产主义的“阴毒”，是焚过书的，如今共产主义著作又成了新焚书者禁书单的基本内容。
  戈培尔也说过，共产主义的“阴毒”可能“藏在科学和人道的外衣下”。
    美国禁书单，包括爱因斯坦（Einstein）的“相对论”（Theory of Relativity），哈拉瓦提（JuliusH．Hlavaty）的“立体几何复习提纲”（Review Digest in Solid Geometry）等“非美”的著作。
    纳粹匪徒们诽谤过海明威（Ernest Heming-way）、左拉（Zola）、汤玛斯·曼（Thomas Mann）及其他许多作家为披着人道外衣的有毒的人，在今天新焚书者的禁书单里也有这些人的名字。
    二十年前戈培尔说过：“犹太人在学术上的地位已经过去了”。今天，在美国，这又成了爱因斯坦的著作和已故的犹太学者弗洛依特（SigmundFreud）的“心理分析引论”（Introduction toPsychoanalysis）一书遭到查禁的原因。
    几个特殊势力集团，趁参议员麦卡锡的特务行为所引起的歇斯底里的机会，焚毁了各类人们所写的作品，其中有许多人是公开反对共产主义的，只不过因为这些人也有一二次触到他们的痛处罢了。
    国会幕后的中国问题实力派正在忙着，这是一个有势力的集团，它想把美国拖进对中国的战争中去，并扶植蒋介石再起。国务院查禁远东问题作家拉迭摩尔（Owen Lattimore）的书，查禁“一九 四五年至一九五一年美国在远东的实录”（TheAmerican Record in the Far Fast，1945—51）的作者拉都莱脱（Kenneth Scott Latourette）的书，查禁中国近代史作家罗辛格（K．Rosinger）的书，多少也与这个集团有关。
    参议员麦卡锡属下的特务们，不但对于进步作家所写的书要加以查禁，对于那些批评麦卡锡作风的人，不管那些批评家多么反对共产主义，也不许他们作声。
    因此，像巴司（Alan Barth）的“自由人的忠诚”（The Loyalty of Free Man）、安德路（Bert Andrews）的“华盛顿的政治迫害”（Washington Witch Hunt）这类书，都被扔到烧书的火场里去了。
    禁书单中有许多犹太人写的和写犹太人的书。
    像沙披士（Morris U．Schappes）所著“一六五四年至一八七五年美国犹太人史料”（A Documentary Historyof the Jewa is the United States1654—1875）一书，就列在禁书单里。
  从美国的极南部发出了另一个势力集团的叫嚣，那就是仇视黑人的集团。黑人所写的书和暴露怎样对待黑人的书都难免列入禁书单里。
    这一类包括史密斯（Lillian Smith）的暴露私刑恐怖的“奇异的果实”（Strange Fruit）和威尔克孙（Doxey A．Wilkerson）的“黑人教育的特殊问题”
  （Special Problems of Negro Educa-tion）。
    怀特（Walter White）和莱特（Richard Wright）等黑人作家，尽管他们骂过共产党，但还是解救不了他们的著作被查禁的命运。
    阴谋复兴德国纳粹主义的集团，是不放过焚烧那些描写纳粹真面目的书籍的机会的。
    被这批焚书者列入禁书单的有海尔曼（Lillian Hellman）的“守望莱茵河”（Watch on the Rhine）、马尔兹（Albert Maltz）的“十字奖章与箭火”（The Cross and the Arrow）等书。
    在今日美国，是谁当权呢？当然啦，是亿万富翁……他们可以左右上述的一些集团，同时他们也最恨公众查究他们自己的财富。
    因此奥科纳尔（Harvey O’Connor）的“梅隆的巨万家财”（Mellon’sMillions）、“阿斯托家”（THE Astors）、
  “钢铁独裁者”（Steel dictator）和“格根哈姆”（Guggenheims）不得不受被焚之灾。
    焚书单中还有一类书籍，本身并不引起当权者的多大不满，但这些书却是那些焚书者所不喜欢的人写的或作插图的。
    甚至参议员麦卡锡本人也很难在哈麦特（Das-hiell Hammett）所写的“瘦子”（The Thin Man）、
  “马尔底斯之鹰”（The Maltese Falcon）或其他动人的小说里找出什么共产主义“阴毒”或颠覆政府的阴谋来，但是由于这些书的作者并不隐讳自己对进步思想的同情，也就不许美国人读这些书了。
    只有像乔叟（Chaucer）的“坎特伯雷故事”（Canterbury Tales）和梅尔微尔（Melville）的“莫别迭克”（Moby Dick），才是“忠诚的”美国人可以放心阅读的古典作品（虽然目前有明显的“读书癖”的人们就会招致特务们的注意）。
    可是谨慎的读者今后还得留心到，不要随便去拿肯特（Rockwell Kent）插图的版本。因为肯特是进步分子。有他作插图的版本是要查禁要焚毁的。
    西浮（Edwin Seaver）所编的“美国幽默文选”（Pageant of American Humour）和恩特尔迈耶（Louis untermeyer）所编的“英美诗歌选集”
  （Treasury of American and British Poetry）之被查禁，使编选家也感到畏惧。
    用现实主义手法描写美国本来面目的书最容易被列入禁书单了。
    德莱塞（Theodore Dreiser）、考德威尔（Ers-kine Caldwell ）、法列尔（James T．Farrell）、斯坦倍克（John Steinbeck）都至少犯过一次这个“罪行”，斯坦倍克最近虽改变了论调，但还不能使他的小说“愤怒的葡萄”（GraPes of Wrath）免于被禁。
      马克·吐温（Mark Twain）是“非美”的吗？对于千百万人来说，他的作品确是美国文学。可是某些粗识文字的焚书者却把他的“在阿瑟王宫廷里的美国佬”（Yanke  at King Arthur’s Court）列为禁书了。
    这些焚书者，和他们的前辈德国纳粹匪徒们一样地憎恨文化。他们一听到“文化”这个字眼，就去摸手枪了。
