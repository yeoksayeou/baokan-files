Xinhua News Agency, December 29th: According to a report by the Vietnam News Agency, a communique released on the 26th stated that the military and civilians in the eastern region of South Vietnam eliminated a total of 7,300 enemy soldiers in the first eleven months of this year.

The eastern region of South Vietnam is a region rich in resources and densely populated. There are vast guerrilla bases such as Dong Thap Muoi, Dong Nai, and Chuyển Mộc. In the past eleven months, the enemy launched many "sweeping operations" in an attempt to "pacify" these areas.

In order to crush the enemy's "sweeping operations," the military and civilians in the eastern region of South Vietnam carried out a protracted and heroic struggle, not only defending the guerrilla bases and strengthening guerrilla activities, but also inflicting heavy losses on the invaders.

The communique stated that in the eleven months up to November 1953, the military and civilians in this region killed, wounded, or captured a total of 7,300 enemy soldiers, including two enemy colonels, six majors, and fifteen captains killed; four enemy companies and eight platoons completely annihilated; 900 various weapons seized; 132 motorcycles destroyed; 53 gunboats sunk or severely damaged; and seven aircraft shot down.

    【新华社二十九日讯】据越南通讯社讯：二十六日发表的公报说，南越东部地区军民在今年头十一个月中共歼灭敌军七千三百名。
    南越东部地区是一个物产富饶和人口稠密的地区。这里有同塔梅、同耐、川木等广大的游击基地。在过去十一个月中，敌人曾发动了许多次“扫荡战”，企图“绥靖”这些地区。
    南越东部地区军民为了粉碎敌人的“扫荡”，进行了持久而英勇的斗争，不仅保卫住了游击基地和加强了游击活动，而且使侵略者遭受重大损失。
    公报说，在到一九五三年十一月为止的十一个月中，这一地区的军民共毙、伤、俘敌军七千三百名，其中包括击毙敌军军官上校二名、少校六名和上尉十五名，全歼敌军四个连、八个排；缴获各种武器九百件；击毁摩托车一百三十二辆；击沉或重伤炮艇五十三艘；击落飞机七架。
