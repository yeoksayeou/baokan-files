Civil Affairs Work Should Actively Serve the National General Line

The Second National Civil Affairs Conference convened by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government has concluded victoriously, and its resolutions have been approved by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government. This conference, based on the general line and general tasks of the transition period, reviewed the civil affairs work of the past four years and determined the guiding principles and tasks for future civil affairs work, so that future civil affairs work will have a clear path under the illumination of the general line. The resolutions of the conference are a specific manifestation of the general line in the current civil affairs work and must be earnestly implemented. This is the responsibility of civil affairs departments at all levels, as well as the responsibility of Party committees and people's governments at all levels.

The scope of civil affairs work is relatively broad, its main tasks being political power construction, preferential treatment, and relief work. During the revolutionary war period and the period of national economic recovery, civil affairs work played a significant role in mobilizing the masses, supporting the revolutionary war, consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, and organizing and promoting various social reforms and production construction. Now that the country has entered a period of planned construction, civil affairs work should play an even greater role in ensuring and promoting the realization of the country's general line and general tasks during the transition period. Strengthening the construction of political power is "to utilize the political power as a lever for transforming the old economy and organizing the new economy" (Stalin, "Problems of Leninism," p. 166). Strengthening the preferential treatment work is to boost morale and consolidate national defense, so as to ensure the construction of the motherland. Strengthening the relief work is to overcome the threat of natural disasters, ensure increased agricultural production, and provide the industrial construction with abundant raw materials and food supplies. At the same time, through civil affairs work, the broad masses of people, families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, disabled revolutionary soldiers, demobilized and transferred soldiers, and disaster victims can be organized and mobilized to engage in production and strive to implement the general line of the transition period. Currently, some cadres do not see the organic connection between civil affairs work and the national general tasks, do not see the importance of civil affairs work, and therefore neglect or are not content with civil affairs work, which is incorrect. On the other hand, some civil affairs cadres only bury themselves in their own work, only handle affairs according to the old set of experiences, limit themselves to a small circle, and work in isolation, failing to actively and proactively cooperate with economic construction work, which is also incorrect. Party committees and people's governments at all levels should educate cadres, especially civil affairs cadres, to make them aware of the importance of civil affairs work and the responsibilities of civil affairs work during the transition period, and to take the general line as a guide, focusing on economic construction to carry out their work, so as to achieve the purpose of serving economic construction.

In terms of political power construction, it is now imperative to strengthen the construction of political power in cities and industrial and mining areas. With the development of China's economic construction, cities and industrial and mining areas are increasing and expanding day by day, and the socialist economic components are growing. The political power as the superstructure of the economic base must adapt to this situation to serve the economic development of cities and industrial and mining areas. At present, the construction of political power in cities and industrial and mining areas cannot keep up with the needs of economic construction. In some places, industrial and mining areas have already formed, but the political power of the industrial and mining areas has not yet been established. In places where political power has been established, some cadres do not have a clear understanding of how the political power can serve industrial and mining enterprises, so the organizational system and working methods of the political power are more or less unable to adapt to the tasks of the political power. For example, in some places, workers and their families account for a large proportion of the population, but the number of worker representatives in the People's Congress is still very small. In some places, the People's Congress discusses agricultural production or residents' welfare more often and discusses issues related to factories and mines less often. Some places adopt the organizational forms and working methods of rural political power, which cannot adapt to the characteristics of the centralization of industrial production. Some political power cadres believe that since they do not lead industrial and mining enterprises, they cannot serve them, so they simply limit their tasks to the management of agricultural areas or urban residential areas. Some industrial and mining enterprise cadres also have the idea of not attaching importance to political power and not relying on political power to handle affairs. As a result, they cannot cooperate closely in their work, and sometimes even phenomena of acting on their own or being uncoordinated occur. Although some places have gained some experience, such as strengthening the relationship between political power and enterprises through the unified leadership of the local Party committee, doing a good job in municipal construction and transportation construction to facilitate the transportation of enterprise raw materials and products, doing a good job in public security and judicial work to ensure production, doing a good job in material supply, water and electricity supply, sanitation work, and housing management to ensure the needs of production and workers' lives, etc. However, these experiences are still very incomplete and must be further created and summarized in the future. At the same time, the urban political power also has the task of carrying out socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and handicrafts. How to carry out these tasks through the People's Congress or the People's Representative Conference, and how to organize and educate the broad masses of urban residents through street offices and neighborhood committees, also need to be created and summarized. In the past, the civil affairs department did not delve deeply enough into the construction of political power in cities and industrial and mining areas, and should improve in the future. At present, the most important thing is to earnestly understand the actual situation. After the closing of the Second National Civil Affairs Conference, the Northeast region immediately attached importance to the construction of political power in cities and industrial and mining areas. Wang Jinxiang, Vice Chairman of the Northeast Administrative Committee, Liu Baotian, Secretary-General, and Zhang Panxin, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, personally led working groups to industrial and mining cities such as Changchun, Fushun, and Fuxin to investigate the situation and create experience, which is very necessary, and other regions should follow suit.

Strengthening the construction of political power in cities and industrial and mining areas does not mean relaxing the work of rural political power construction. Rural political power faces the vast ocean of the individual small-peasant economy, with about 100 million households. If these individual small peasants are not organized and led, they will spontaneously move towards the road of capitalism. The responsibility of rural political power in educating peasants and carrying out socialist transformation of agriculture is very arduous. Some people say: The rural political power is the peasant political power, which is wrong. The rural political power is the political power led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, and it is the grassroots political power of China's people's democratic dictatorship. Rural political power cadres should stand on the position of the working class and lead the peasants to gradually embark on the happy road of socialism. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the construction of rural political power, especially through the propaganda of the general line and the general election work, to raise the socialist ideological awareness of rural cadres, rectify and improve the organization of township political power, and make the organization and system of township political power adapt to the development of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement. At present, in some places, township political power cannot become a truly independent level of political power, and the township people's congress and the township people's government committee are not used regularly to promote work, and the democratic and concentrated strength of the township political power is not brought into play, all of which must be improved. Only by giving play to the enthusiasm and initiative of the township people's congress, the township people's government committee, and various working committees can the worker-peasant alliance be further consolidated and the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement of agriculture and handicrafts be promoted. Party committees and people's governments at the provincial and county levels should attach importance to the construction of rural political power and urge the civil affairs department to do this work effectively.

The central link of political power construction is to improve and consolidate the system of the People's Congress and give full play to its superior effectiveness to serve the country's various constructions. At present, general elections are being carried out everywhere, and the People's Congress is being convened, which will make China's system of people's democratic dictatorship more complete. The People's Congress is the organ through which the people exercise their political power, and its resolutions have legal effect, which must be jointly observed by all the people and implemented by the people's government. The resolution of the Second National Civil Affairs Conference pointed out: "The People's Representative Conference and the People's Congress are powerful weapons that facilitate the working class to realize its leadership over the country, facilitate the concentration and realization of the will of the vast majority of the people, and can fully educate and mobilize the people to gradually realize the general line and general tasks of the transition period and guide the country to the happy road of socialism." Party committees and people's governments at all levels should attach importance to the country's basic system and fully and correctly apply it.

In terms of preferential treatment and relief work, we should follow the requirements of the general line, mobilize the masses to organize production, and carry out the mutual aid and cooperation movement. All families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers who have whole labor power, half labor power, or other production conditions should be educated to actively participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, so that they can not only achieve self-sufficiency in production and establish family affairs, but also become active factors in developing agricultural production and promoting the socialist transformation of agriculture. Because the families of revolutionary martyrs and the families of revolutionary soldiers have flesh-and-blood connections with the revolutionary ranks; disabled revolutionary soldiers and demobilized and transferred soldiers have received education and training in the people's army and revolutionary war; many of them are Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members, they have the superior conditions to become active elements in agricultural production and various tasks. Many families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized and transferred soldiers have become prestigious model figures among the masses. We must pay attention to them, give play to their political and productive enthusiasm, and absorb those who are suitable to participate in agricultural production cooperatives, credit cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives, militia organizations, grassroots political power work, and other tasks. The work of plowing on behalf should also be gradually combined with mutual aid and cooperation organizations under the principle of voluntary mutual benefit. In disaster relief work, disaster victims should be educated to organize themselves, carry out self-salvation through production, save food to tide over the famine, and adopt mutual aid and cooperation methods to solve difficulties. We should not only do a good job in preferential treatment and relief work, but also promote the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement of agriculture and handicrafts through these works. Therefore, we must oppose the "package" view, that is, the view that problems are solved purely by relying on financial strength instead of relying on organizing the masses to produce. If this view is allowed to develop, it will not only prevent the country from concentrating greater strength on industrial construction, but also inevitably foster the dependent thinking of the families of revolutionary martyrs, the families of revolutionary soldiers, and the disaster victims, weaken their productive enthusiasm, and make their production and living problems unable to be properly resolved. Of course, correcting the "package" view does not mean that the work of plowing on behalf can be ignored, and the government's necessary assistance and relief can be cancelled. While launching mutual aid and cooperative production, the government should still do a good job in the work of plowing on behalf and providing material subsidies to poor revolutionary martyr families and revolutionary soldier families who have no labor force, the comforting work for disabled revolutionary soldiers, the resettlement work for demobilized and transferred soldiers, and the necessary relief work for disaster victims.

We should realize that civil affairs work is closely related to the lives of the broad masses of people. Only by strengthening the ideological leadership of the working class, eliminating the influence of bourgeois ideology, opposing subjectivism and bureaucracy, and establishing a style of going deep into reality, conducting investigation and research, and following the mass line, can we give play to the strength and wisdom of the people, achieve success, and win the support of the people. Experience has proved that as long as the masses are mobilized, any arduous task can be successfully completed. Civil affairs departments at all levels must also frequently ask for instructions and report to the Party and government leadership organs, and oppose decentralism. Only in this way can we ensure that there are fewer deviations in the implementation of policies, and it is also convenient to mobilize the strength of relevant departments and lower-level governments. We must be good at actively contacting relevant departments and using the form of working committees to organize relevant departments under the unified leadership of the Party and government, divide responsibilities, and cooperate closely. Of course, the civil affairs department must first work hard on its own and not be afraid to take responsibility in order to win the assistance of all parties. Party committees and people's governments at all levels should often care about civil affairs work and discuss it regularly. Regularly check and supervise the civil affairs department to help them improve their work efficiency and improve their working methods. We must strive to further improve civil affairs work in order to implement the resolutions of the Second National Civil Affairs Conference.

### 民政工作应积极为国家总路线服务

    民政工作应积极为国家总路线服务
    中央人民政府内务部召开的第二次全国民政会议已胜利闭幕，其决议业经中央人民政府政务院批准。这一次会议依据过渡时期的总路线和总任务，检查了四年来的民政工作，确定了今后民政工作的方针和任务，使今后民政工作在总路线的照耀下，有了明确的道路。会议的决议也就是总路线在当前民政工作上的具体化，必须认真予以贯彻。这是各级民政部门的责任，也是各级党委和人民政府的责任。
    民政工作的业务范围比较广泛，它的主要业务是政权建设工作、优抚工作和救济工作。在革命战争时期和国民经济的恢复时期，民政工作在发动群众，支援革命战争，巩固人民民主专政，组织和推动各项社会改革和生产建设等方面都起了很大的作用。现在国家进入了有计划的建设时期，民政工作应为保证和促进国家过渡时期的总路线和总任务的实现，发挥更大的作用。加强政权建设工作是 “要把政权利用为改造旧经济和组织新经济的杠杆”（斯大林著“列宁主义问题”第一百六十六页）。加强优抚工作是要鼓舞士气巩固国防，以保障祖国的建设。加强救济工作是要战胜自然灾害的威胁，保证农业增产，使工业建设获得丰富的原料和食粮的供应。同时，通过民政工作，又能把广大人民群众、革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人和灾民，组织和动员起来进行生产，为贯彻过渡时期的总路线而奋斗。目前有些干部，看不见民政工作和国家总任务的有机联系，看不见民政工作的重要，因而忽视民政工作或不安心民政工作，这是不正确的；另一方面，又有一些民政干部只埋头进行本身业务，只根据老一套的经验办事，把自己局限在小圈子内，孤立地进行工作，不主动地积极地去和经济建设工作配合行动，这也是不正确的。各级党委和人民政府应该教育干部特别是教育民政工作干部，使他们认识民政工作的重要，认识民政工作在过渡时期的责任，并以总路线为指针，围绕着经济建设去开展自己的业务，以达到服务于经济建设的目的。
    在政权建设方面，今后必须加强城市和工矿区的政权建设工作。随着我国经济建设的发展，城市和工矿区日益增多和扩大，社会主义的经济成份日益增长，作为经济基础的上层建筑的政权，就必须适应这种情况为城市和工矿区的经济发展服务。目前城市和工矿区的政权建设，赶不上经济建设发展的需要。有的地方，工矿区业已形成，而工矿区的政权却尚未建立。在已建立政权的地方，有些干部对政权怎样为工矿企业服务，认识也不够明确，因而政权的组织制度和工作方法等，都或多或少地不能适应于政权的任务。如有的地方工人及其家属已占人口的很大比重，而人民代表会议的工人代表名额，却仍然很少。有的地方在人民代表会议上讨论农业生产或居民福利的问题多，讨论与厂矿企业有关的问题少。有的地方采用农村政权的组织形式和工作方法，以致不能适应工业生产的集中性的特点。有些政权干部，认为自己既不领导工矿企业，就无法为他们服务，索性把自己的任务局限在管理农业地区或城市居民区的范围内。有些工矿企业干部也有不重视政权、不依靠政权办事的思想。这样，在工作上就不能密切配合，有时甚至发生了各自为政或不协调的现象。虽然有些地方已获得了一些经验，如通过当地党委的统一领导，把政权和企业的关系密切起来，搞好市政建设、交通建设以便利企业原料产品的运输，搞好治安保卫工作和司法工作以保障生产，搞好物资供应、水电供应、卫生工作、房屋管理等以保证生产和工人生活的需要等等。但这些经验还是很不完整的，今后必须进一步地创造和总结。同时，城市政权还有对资本主义工商业和对手工业进行社会主义改造的任务，怎样通过人民代表大会或人民代表会议来进行这些工作；怎样通过街道办事处和居民委员会去组织和教育城市的广大居民，也都需要创造和总结经验。民政部门过去对城市和工矿区的政权建设工作钻研不够，今后应加改进。目前最重要的是认真了解实际情况，在第二次全国民政会议闭会以后，东北地区立即重视了城市和工矿区的政权建设工作，由东北行政委员会副主席汪金祥、秘书长刘宝田、民政局长张磐新等亲自率领工作组，分别到长春、抚顺、阜新等工矿城市进行摸清情况创造经验的工作，这是很必要的，其他地区也应该仿行。
    加强城市和工矿区的政权建设，并不等于要放松农村政权建设的工作。农村政权面对着个体的小农经济的汪洋大海，其户数有一亿左右，这些个体小农若不加以组织和领导，就会自发地走向资本主义的道路。农村政权在教育农民和对农业进行社会主义改造方面的责任是很艰巨的。有些人说：乡村政权就是农民政权，这是不对的。乡村政权是以工人阶级为领导的、以工农联盟为基础的政权，是我国人民民主专政的基层政权。乡村政权干部应站在工人阶级的立场上，领导农民逐步走上社会主义的幸福道路。所以，必须加强乡村政权建设工作，特别是通过总路线的宣传和普选工作，来提高乡村干部的社会主义思想觉悟，整顿和改进乡政权组织，使乡村政权的组织和制度，适应农业互助合作运动的发展。目前有些地方，乡政权尚不能成为真正独立进行工作的一级政权，没有经常运用乡人民代表大会和乡人民政府委员会来推动工作，没有发挥乡政权的民主集中的力量，这些都必须加以改进。要使乡人民代表大会、乡人民政府委员会和各种工作委员会发挥积极性和主动性，才能更加巩固工农联盟，促进农业和手工业的互助合作运动的发展。各省、县党委和人民政府应重视乡村政权建设工作，并督促民政部门把这一工作切实做好。
    政权建设工作的中心环节，是健全和巩固人民代表大会的制度，发挥其优越的效能，以服务于国家的各项建设。目前各地正在进行普选，召开人民代表大会，这将使我国人民民主专政制度更加完备。人民代表大会是人民行使政权的机关，它的决议有法律上的效力，全体人民必须共同遵守，人民政府必须依照执行。第二次全国民政会议的决议中指出：“人民代表会议和人民代表大会，是便利于工人阶级对国家实现其领导，便利于最大多数人民集中和实现其意志，和能够充分教育人民发动人民逐步实现过渡时期的总路线总任务，引导国家走上社会主义幸福之路的有力的武器。”各级党委和人民政府都应该重视国家的基本制度，充分地正确地加以运用。
    在优抚和救济工作方面，应依从总路线的要求，发动群众组织生产，开展互助合作运动。应教育一切有整劳动力半劳动力或有其他生产条件的革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人和复员转业军人，积极参加互助合作组织，以便使他们不但达到生产自给、建立家务，而且成为发展农业生产和推动对农业社会主义改造的积极因素。由于革命烈士家属、革命军人家属和革命队伍有血肉的联系；革命残废军人、复员转业军人受过人民军队的教育和革命战争的锻炼；他们之中有很多人是共产党员和青年团员，他们具有成为农业生产和各项工作中的积极分子的优越条件。不少革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人、复员转业军人已成为群众中的有威信的模范人物，我们必须予以重视，发挥他们在政治上和生产上的积极性，并吸收他们中条件适当的人参加农业生产合作社、信用合作社、供销合作社、民兵组织、基层政权工作及其他各项工作。代耕工作，也应在自愿互利的原则下，使代耕逐步和互助合作组织结合起来。在救灾工作上，应教育灾民组织起来，生产自救，节约渡荒，并采用互助合作的办法以解决困难。我们不但要做好优抚救济工作，而且可以通过这些工作，促进农业和手工业的互助合作运动的发展。因此，我们必须反对那种“包下来”的观点，即不依靠组织群众生产去解决问题而单纯依靠财政力量去解决问题的观点。如果让这种观点发展下去，则不仅会使国家不能集中更大力量进行工业建设，而且势必助长革命烈士家属、革命军人家属和灾民的依赖思想，减弱他们的生产积极性，使他们的生产和生活问题不能得到妥善的解决。当然纠正“包下来”的观点，并不等于说代耕工作可以忽视，政府的必要的扶助和救济可以取消。在发动互助合作的生产的同时，政府仍应做好对贫苦无劳动力的革命烈士家属、革命军人家属的代耕和实物补助的工作、对革命残废军人的抚?工作、对复员转业军人的安置工作以及对灾民的必要的救济工作。
    我们应该认识：民政工作是和广大人民的生活密切联系的，只有加强工人阶级的思想领导，肃清资产阶级思想的影响，反对主观主义、官僚主义，树立深入实际、调查研究、走群众路线的作风，才能发挥人民的力量和智慧，才能取得成绩并获得人民的拥护。经验证明，只要把群众发动起来，任何艰巨的任务都能够胜利完成。各级民政工作部门还必须经常向党政领导机关请示报告，反对分散主义。只有这样，才能保证在执行政策中少出偏差，而且便于发动有关部门和下级政府的力量；必须善于主动地联系各有关部门，运用工作委员会的形式在党政统一领导下将各有关部门组织起来，分工负责，通力合作。当然，民政部门必须首先自己努力，不怕承担责任，才能争取各方面的协助。各级党委和人民政府，应经常关心民政工作，定期加以讨论。经常检查和督促民政部门，帮助他们提高工作效率，改进工作方法。我们要为贯彻第二次全国民政会议的决议，进一步作好民政工作而奋斗。
