    I. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao have put forward to the people of the whole country the general line and general task of our country during the transition period, which is: "To gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the country over a fairly long period of time, and to gradually realize the socialist transformation of the country's agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce." The general line is a lighthouse illuminating all our work. It centrally reflects the long-term and supreme interests of the people of the whole country. It illuminates the road for the people and youth of the whole country to a better and happier future. Now the Party is leading the study and publicity of the general line among the masses of all regions and strata of the country. The organizations of the League at all levels should also, under the leadership of the local Party organizations, earnestly organize this study and publicity among all League members and young people of the country. They should understand that organizing this study and publicity is the most realistic education in the communist worldview and morality for the broad masses of League members and young people. Through this education, they should love our country's socialist future and support the Party's general line and general task during the transition period, and better cultivate themselves to become strong fighters for the realization of socialism. This is the most fundamental task of ideological construction for the League at present and for a long time to come. The effect of this work will not only directly affect whether the League can play the role of assistant and reserve force of the Party during the transition period, but also directly affect the consolidation and improvement of the League's organization.
    II. It is necessary to tell the youth of the whole country that the historical task of realizing the socialist industrialization of the country and gradually transitioning to socialism will mainly rely on the young generation of New China to complete. This is a very glorious and arduous task. A beautiful and happy socialist society will never fall from the sky. It must be realized by the youth of the whole country and the people of the whole country together, continuing to carry forward the glorious tradition of the Chinese people's hard struggle, constantly overcoming difficulties and engaging in selfless labor. If we love our motherland, we must strive to make our motherland a more beautiful and powerful socialist motherland. We must make ourselves active builders of the new life of the motherland. We must subordinate personal interests to national interests, temporary interests to long-term interests, and consciously subordinate our daily activities to the great goal of realizing socialist transformation.
    III. The development of socialist industry, first of all, the development of heavy industry, is of decisive significance for the realization of our country's general line during the transition period. Only the development of heavy industry can drive the development of the entire industry, transportation, and agriculture, and strengthen the strength of national defense; and only the development of socialist industry can strengthen the leading role of the socialist economy over other economic components, and promote the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. Therefore, to publicize the general line to the League members and young people in all factories and mines, it is necessary to point out the great responsibility of the Chinese working class in socialist transformation. It is necessary to encourage them, together with all workers, to give play to the pioneering role of the Chinese working class, who are brave, hardworking, and loyal to the cause of the entire people, and to overcome the influence of the bourgeoisie's selfish and decadent thoughts on the working class. It is necessary to encourage them to always attach importance to improving their technical proficiency, learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, abiding by labor discipline, and actively throwing themselves into the production increase and economy practice competition, and regard completing and overfulfilling the state plan as their most sacred obligation.
    IV. Realizing the socialist transformation of agriculture is an arduous task. To publicize the general line to rural youth, it is necessary to make them understand the importance of the worker-peasant alliance, that industry and agriculture must support each other, that agriculture has the broadest prospects for development, and that participating in agricultural production is as glorious as participating in industrial production. It is necessary to make them realize that developing mutual aid and cooperation is the only way to increase agricultural production and enable everyone to live a prosperous life, while taking the capitalist road will impoverish the majority of farmers. It is necessary to encourage rural youth and all farmers to actively participate in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, to strive to learn cultural and scientific knowledge, to improve farming techniques, to increase agricultural production, and to enthusiastically sell surplus grain and industrial raw materials to the state to help the state's construction.
    V. It is necessary to make the youth understand that in order to realize the general line and complete the state's various construction plans, it is necessary to cultivate a large number of new talents accordingly. Young people in all work positions should love their work, study their profession, and constantly improve their level of awareness and work. Young people in schools must love knowledge, love labor, and tirelessly acquire new knowledge according to the needs of the country, and strive to cultivate themselves into outstanding construction talents who are loyal to the people, loyal to the socialist cause, and possess scientific and technological knowledge and are not afraid of difficulties.
    VI. To do a good job in publicizing the general line of the transition period to young League members and the broad masses of young people, League cadres at all levels must first study well. Only when League cadres truly draw a line in thought with capitalism and truly understand the general line can they correctly carry out publicity. The method of convening League cadre meetings, representative meetings, activist meetings, or organizing League cadres and Party and government cadres to hold meetings together to study the general line in a concentrated manner should be adopted and promoted in all regions. League schools and League training classes at all levels should conduct education on the general line for students.
    In study and publicity, regardless of whether it is for cadres, League members, or the masses, the study and understanding of the general line must be regarded as a process of gradual ideological improvement, and must not be simple and impetuous. It is necessary to be good at inspiring everyone to boldly raise questions, and after deliberation and discussion, conduct analysis and criticism based on the spirit of the general line, in order to obtain a clear understanding. It is necessary to be good at using living people and events and the personal experience of the masses to concretize the principles; be good at using methods of recollection, comparison, calculation, and commendation of good people and good deeds to carry out publicity, and strive to persuade people with reason. League committees at all levels must always attach importance to summarizing and promoting the experience of work in this area, in order to improve the League's publicity and education work through the study and publicity of the general line.

    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会
    关于学习和宣传国家在过渡时期总路线的指示
    一、党中央和毛主席向全国人民提出了我们国家在过渡时期的总路线和总任务，这就是：“要在一个相当长的时期内，逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，并逐步实现国家对农业、对手工业和对私营工商业的社会主义改造”。总路线是照耀着我们各项工作的灯塔，它集中地反映了全国人民的长远利益和最高利益，它照亮了全国人民和青年走向更加美好幸福的道路。现在党正在全国各地和各阶层群众中领导总路线的学习和宣传，团的各级组织也应当在各地党组织的领导下，在全体团员和全国青年中认真地组织这种学习和宣传，应当懂得：组织这种学习和宣传，就是对广大团内外青年最现实的共产主义人生观与道德观的教育。通过这种教育，使他们热爱我国的社会主义前途和拥护党在过渡时期的总路线和总任务，更好地培养自己成为为实现社会主义而奋斗的坚强战士。这是团在当前和今后长时期内最根本的思想建设任务。这一工作的效果如何，不仅直接关系到过渡时期团能否发挥党的助手与后备军的作用，也直接关系到团的组织的巩固与提高。
    二、要向全国青年讲清楚，实现国家的社会主义工业化和逐步地过渡到社会主义的历史任务，主要将依靠新中国的年青一代来完成。这是一个十分光荣而又艰巨的任务。美好幸福的社会主义社会，绝不会凭空从天上掉下来，必须全国青年和全国人民一道，继续发扬中国人民艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，不断地战胜困难和从事忘我的劳动才能实现。我们热爱祖国，就要努力使我们的祖国成为更加美好而强大的社会主义的祖国，就要使自己成为祖国新生活的积极建设者，就必须使个人利益服从国家利益，暂时利益服从长远利益，自觉地使自己的日常活动服从于实现社会主义改造的伟大目标。
    三、发展社会主义的工业首先是发展其中的重工业，对实现我们国家过渡时期总路线有着决定的意义。只有重工业的发展才能带动整个工业、运输业和农业的发展，才能加强国防的力量；又只有社会主义工业的发展，才能加强社会主义经济对其他各种经济成份的领导作用，才能推动农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。因此，向一切厂矿企业中的团内外青年宣传总路线，就要指出中国工人阶级在社会主义改造中的重大责任。要鼓舞他们和全体工人一道，发挥中国工人阶级勇敢勤劳、忠于全体人民事业的先锋作用，克服资产阶级那种自私自利的腐朽思想对于工人阶级的影响。要鼓舞他们经常重视提高技术熟练程度，学习苏联先进经验，遵守劳动纪律，积极地投入到增产节约竞赛中去，把完成和超额完成国家计划当作自己最崇高的义务。
    四、实现对农业的社会主义改造，是一项艰巨的任务。向农村青年宣传总路线，就要使他们懂得工农联盟的重要，工业和农业必须相互支援，农业有最广阔的发展前途，参加农业生产和参加工业生产同样是光荣的。要使他们认识发展互助合作，是提高农业生产、使大家都能过富裕生活的唯一道路，而走资本主义的路是使大多数农民穷困的道路。要鼓舞农村青年和全体农民一道，积极参加互助合作运动，努力学习文化科学知识，提高耕作技术，增加农业生产，并踊跃地把余粮和工业原料卖给国家，帮助国家建设。
    五、要使青年们懂得，为了实现总路线，完成国家各项建设计划，必须与此相适应地去培养大批新的人材。一切工作岗位上的青年，都应该热爱自己的工作，钻研业务，不断地提高自己的觉悟水平和工作水平。学校中的青年，要热爱知识，热爱劳动，按照国家需要不倦地去获取新的知识，努力把自己培养成为忠于人民，忠于社会主义事业和具有科学技术的不怕困难的优秀的建设人材。
    六、要做好向青年团员和广大青年关于过渡时期总路线的宣传，团的各级干部必须首先学习好。只有当团的干部真正从思想上和资本主义划清界限，真正懂得了总路线，才有可能正确地进行宣传。召开团的干部会、代表会、积极分子会，或组织团的干部和党、政干部一起开会，集中学习总路线的办法，各地都应当加以采用和推广。各级团校、团训班，都应该向学员进行总路线的教育。
    在学习和宣传中，不管是对干部、团员或群众，都必须把学习和领会总路线看做是一个思想逐步提高的过程，不能简单急躁。要善于启发大家大胆地提出问题，经过酝酿讨论，根据总路线的精神，进行分析批判，以求获得明确的认识。要善于用活人活事和群众的切身经验，把道理具体化；善于采用回忆、对比、算账和表扬好人好事的方法去进行宣传，力求做到以理服人。各级团委都要经常重视关于这方面工作经验的总结和推广，以期通过总路线的学习和宣传，把团的宣传教育工作提高一步。
