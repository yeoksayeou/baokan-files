Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 8th:

    Foreign Minister Nam Il of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on December 7th regarding the illegal resolution passed by the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly on December 3, 1953, under the manipulation of the United States government, which slandered the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers for alleged "atrocities" against UN forces' prisoners of war and other personnel in Korea. The statement is as follows:

    On December 3, 1953, the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, under the open manipulation of the United States government, illegally passed a resolution concerning the so-called "atrocities" committed by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers against UN forces' prisoners of war and other personnel in Korea.

    In this regard, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea authorizes me to declare: that the United Nations General Assembly's resolution is based on the shameless fabrication and baseless slander of the American ruling clique, which is unwilling to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, and is completely false and illegal, and must be severely condemned.

    During the discussion and adoption of this resolution, not only were the official representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China not allowed to participate, but it was based on the one-sided and false fabrications of the American ruling clique, the executioners who massacre the Korean people. The fact that countries headed by the Soviet Union, which defend peace and democracy, resolutely opposed it, and that representatives from many other Asian and Arab countries expressed disapproval, fully demonstrates how unjust, false, and provocative the United Nations resolution is.

    As everyone knows, the American ruling clique, which launched the aggressive war against Korea, in order to enslave the Korean people and threaten and intimidate the people of the world who defend peace and national independence, has violently violated international regulations on the conduct of war, and under the guise of the United Nations, has unscrupulously committed all kinds of heinous and bloody atrocities against the peaceful Korean people.

    The American aggressors have universally engaged in the criminal acts of massacring, torturing, and plundering peaceful residents in Korea, especially women, children, and the elderly. They have not only indiscriminately carried out destructive bombings of Korean villages and cities, but have even used weapons of mass destruction strictly prohibited by international law – poison gas and bacteriological weapons. These atrocities of the American aggressors have been conclusively confirmed by investigations by fair and authoritative international organizations and prominent figures, and have been known to world public opinion.

    The American ruling clique, under the guise of the United Nations, has subjected prisoners of war from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers to inhumane treatment. The American aggressors have massacred large numbers of prisoners of war from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and have used all kinds of vicious means to inflict torture and violence on prisoners of war. The crimes of the American aggressors are so cruel that even Dodd, the American officer in charge of prisoner-of-war camps, could not help but admit it.

    The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has lodged more than ten protests with the United Nations against the evil atrocities committed by the American ruling clique in Korea under the name of the United Nations, demanding that appropriate measures be taken to stop these atrocities. However, the United Nations, which should be advocating peace and international cooperation, has not only ignored the legitimate and lawful demands of the Korean people, but has consistently maintained a policy of acquiescing in and following the United States in committing these crimes under the guise of the United Nations. This policy pursued by the United States and its satellite states in the United Nations seriously violates the original purpose of the United Nations and the United Nations Charter. Therefore, the United Nations has been reduced to a shameful tool of the American ruling clique, which appears as the butcher of the Korean people, and the credibility of the United Nations has been greatly lost.

    The United Nations has always turned a blind eye to the heinous crimes committed by the American ruling clique in Korea under the guise of the United Nations, and has ignored the just appeals of the Korean people; yet today, based on the one-sided, false, and provocative "materials" put forward by the American ruling clique, it has passed a ridiculous resolution "condemning" the so-called "atrocities" of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. This not only exposes the shameful true face of the United States and its satellite states once again in broad daylight, but also further reduces the credibility of the United Nations in the eyes of the people of the world.

    Despite the inhumane and criminal atrocities committed by the American ruling clique in Korea under the guise of the United Nations, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers have thoroughly adhered to the noble principles of humanitarianism, and have consistently provided humanitarian treatment to prisoners of war from the "United Nations" side, in accordance with the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War.

    The noble humanitarian and lenient policy implemented by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea towards enemy prisoners of war and other personnel has been recognized not only by the prisoners of war who were directly accommodated, but also by world public opinion.

    The true intention of the American ruling clique in manipulating representatives of its satellite states in the United Nations to fabricate the above-mentioned false and provocative resolution, despite all this, is that the American ruling clique not only is unwilling to peacefully resolve the Korean issue and ease international tensions, but also attempts to incite world opinion to provoke a new war, deliberately obstruct the proper resolution of the prisoner-of-war issue in accordance with the armistice agreement and the convening of a higher-level political conference, and attempts to cover up the criminal atrocities committed by the American aggressors in Korea and the truth about the massacres and inhumane treatment of prisoners of war from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in front of the people of the world, and to provoke and slander the policy of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers towards prisoners of war, which has received the just support of world opinion, in order to achieve its sinister political goals.

    The Korean people, who clearly recognize the aggressive and criminal nature of the American ruling clique, together with the good people of the world, resolutely deny and condemn the above-mentioned United Nations resolution fabricated by the American ruling clique, and firmly protest and condemn the United Nations' acquiescence in the criminal atrocities of the American ruling clique and its active following of the perfidious behavior of the United States. The Korean people will, together with all peace-loving people in the world, jointly fight for peace, democracy, and international cooperation.

    南日外务相代表朝鲜政府发表声明
    严厉谴责联大通过诬蔑朝中人民部队的非法决议
    【新华社平壤八日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日在十二月七日，就一九五三年十二月三日联合国第八届大会在美国政府的操纵下非法通过的诬蔑朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在朝鲜对联合国军被俘人员和其他人员施行所谓“暴行”的决议，发表声明如下：
    一九五三年十二月三日，联合国第八届大会在美国政府的公开操纵下，非法通过了关于朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在朝鲜对联合国军被俘人员和其他人员的所谓“暴行”的决议。
    为此，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府授权本人声明：认为联合国大会的这个决议是根据不愿意和平解决朝鲜问题的美国统治集团的无耻捏造和毫无根据的中伤意图而制造出来的，是完全虚伪的和非法的，必须加以严厉谴责。
    在讨论和通过这个决议时，不仅不让朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国的正式代表参加，而且根据的是屠杀朝鲜人民的刽子手——美国统治集团片面和虚伪的捏造。以苏联为首的保卫和平、民主的各国坚决加以反对和其他许多亚洲及阿拉伯国家代表表示不赞成的事实，已充分证明联合国的决议是多么的不正当、虚伪和带有挑拨性。
    众所周知，对朝鲜发动侵略战争的美国统治集团，为了奴役朝鲜人民，威胁和恫吓保卫和平与民族独立的全世界人民，曾狂暴地违反关于进行战争的国际法规，在联合国的幌子下肆无忌惮地对和平的朝鲜人民制造了一切令人发指的血腥暴行。
    美国侵略者在朝鲜对和平居民，尤其是对妇孺和老人，普遍地进行了罪恶的虐杀、拷问和掠夺。他们对朝鲜的农村及城市不但无区别地肆行毁灭性的轰炸，甚至还使用了国际法所严禁的大规模杀人武器——毒气和细菌武器。美国侵略者的这些暴行，由于公正而有权威的国际团体及著名人士的调查，已被确凿证实，并已被全世界的社会舆论所共知。
    美国统治集团在联合国的幌子下，对朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军被俘人员进行了非人道的虐待。美国侵略者大量地屠杀朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军被俘人员，并用一切恶毒的手段对被俘人员横施拷问和暴力。美国侵略者的这种罪行是如此的残酷，甚至连美军管理战俘营长官杜德也不能不承认。
      对于美国统治集团在联合国的名义下在朝鲜进行的这种罪恶暴行，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府曾向联合国提出过十多次抗议，要求采取适当措施制止这种暴行。然而，理应倡导和平与国际合作的联合国，不但无视朝鲜人民这种正当而合法的要求，反而始终保持默认和跟随美国在联合国幌子下制造这种罪行的政策。美国及其仆从国家在联合国所实行的这种政策，严重地违反了联合国原来的宗旨和联合国宪章。因此，联合国便降为以朝鲜人民的屠杀者登场的美国统治集团的可耻的御用工具，使联合国的威信大大丧失。
    联合国对于美国统治集团在联合国幌子下在朝鲜所进行的万恶罪行一直不闻不问，抹煞朝鲜人民正义的呼声；今天却又根据美国统治集团所提出的片面、虚伪和充满挑拨性的“材料”，通过了“谴责”朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的所谓“暴行”的可笑决议，这不但在光天化日之下又一次暴露了美国及其仆从国家可耻的真面目，而且使联合国在全世界人民面前更加降低了它的威信。
    尽管美国统治集团在联合国幌子下在朝鲜进行残无人道的罪恶暴行，但是，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军却彻底遵守崇高的人道主义原则，对于所收容的“联合国”军方面的俘虏，始终一贯地根据关于俘虏待遇的日内瓦公约，予以人道主义的待遇。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府对于敌方俘虏及其他人员所实行的崇高的人道主义宽待政策，不但为曾被直接收容的俘虏，并且为全世界的社会舆论所公认。
    美国统治集团不顾这一切，而在联合国操纵其仆从国家代表制造出上述虚伪、挑拨性的决议的真实意图在于：美国统治集团不仅不愿意和平解决朝鲜问题与缓和国际紧张局势，而且企图煽动世界舆论来挑拨新战争，企图故意阻挠战俘问题正当地根据停战协定解决和高一级政治会议的召开，企图在全世界人民面前掩盖美国侵略者在朝鲜制造的罪恶暴行及大量屠杀和非人道虐待朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军被俘人员的真相，挑拨和中伤受到世界舆论的正当支持的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军对待战俘的政策，以达到其凶恶的政治目的。
    清楚地认识了美国统治集团的侵略、罪恶本质的朝鲜人民，和全世界善良的人民一起，断然否认和斥责美国统治集团虚伪捏造的上述联合国决议，坚决抗议和谴责联合国默认美国统治集团的罪恶暴行并积极跟随美国的背信弃义的行为。朝鲜人民将和全世界爱好和平的人民一起，为和平、民主和国际合作共同奋斗。
