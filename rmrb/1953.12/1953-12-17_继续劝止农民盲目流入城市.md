    Continue to dissuade farmers from blindly flowing into cities
    He Xinghuan
    After the State Council of the Central People's Government issued the "Instructions on Discouraging Farmers from Blindly Flowing into Cities" in April of this year, the phenomenon of farmers blindly flowing into cities once improved after emphasis and efforts from all sides. However, according to recent letters from readers, since the beginning of autumn, especially after the autumn harvest, many farmers have once again blindly flowed into cities. For example, in Xibantun Village, Wucheng County, Shandong Province, out of the original 123 male laborers, 45 had left by the end of September. In Qianying Village, Cang County, Hebei Province, laborers from 86 out of 286 households had gone out. Furthermore, according to a letter from Chu Rongxuan of the Civil Affairs Section of the Zhengzhou Municipal People's Government in Henan Province, over 309 farmers from Lingbi in Anhui, Tongshan in Jiangsu, Pizhou and Sui counties flowed into the Nanyao and Shiliupu areas of Zhengzhou in just a few days in October.
    Why have so many farmers blindly flowed into cities again since the beginning of autumn? There are several reasons for this: After some areas suffered natural disasters, some farmers lacked confidence in production for self-salvation; some areas had little land and a large population, and the surplus labor force had not found a proper outlet; some farmers believed that there was "nothing to do" in agricultural production after the autumn harvest and autumn planting; some farmers, especially young farmers, did not clearly understand the relationship between national industrial construction and agricultural production, and did not understand the importance of developing agricultural production, so they were not at ease in agricultural production, etc. However, the main key to the problem lies in the fact that rural cadres in these areas have not patiently educated farmers about their thinking, and have not organized them to engage in agricultural and sideline production according to the specific conditions of the area, and helped them solve problems and difficulties in production and life; some village cadres even use an irresponsible attitude, issuing introduction letters indiscriminately, and allowing farmers to go out at will, in order to reduce their own "burden", thus deepening the chaotic phenomenon of farmers blindly flowing into cities. For example, Sun Boyuan and Zhang Yingde of the Civil Affairs Section of Ningwu County, Shanxi Province, wrote that there were seventy or eighty disaster victims in the Sunjiazhuang area of the third district of Pingyin County, Shandong Province, because the local government did not organize them well to engage in on-site production for self-salvation, they wandered to Ningwu County, Shanxi Province, more than 1,800 miles away from their homes (the Ningwu County People's Government has taken measures to send this group of disaster victims back to their hometown). Feng Wancai of the Beijing Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau wrote that among the farmers who blindly came to Beijing from Hebei, Shandong and other places in September to find work, many held letters of introduction from local governments, with 42 issued by the village governments of Chaocheng and Guancheng in Shandong alone. In addition, some factories, mines, enterprises, and construction units, without going through the labor department or local government, arbitrarily sent people to the countryside to recruit workers or randomly accepted farmers who blindly flowed into cities. For example, Hu Xiaoyuan of the Wuhan Changjiang Daily and Pan Xianwu of the Huangpi County Fifteenth District Office in Hubei wrote that the Second Construction Engineering Company of Central South and the Wuchang construction site of the Huazhong Iron and Steel Company recruited hundreds of farmers from Huangpi, Echeng, Xiaogan and other counties in Hubei through contractors without going through the labor department and relevant local governments. This wrong approach also objectively contributed to the chaotic phenomenon of farmers blindly flowing into cities.
    The aforementioned situation of farmers blindly flowing into cities has already caused very bad consequences: This has not only increased the surplus labor force in cities, affected the social order of cities, and added difficulties to urban work; but more importantly, it has seriously affected agricultural production and caused difficulties in the lives of farmers themselves. Many farmers sold their family rations, clothing, and even farming cattle, fields, and houses as travel expenses when they went out; some came out without harvesting the autumn crops in the fields or planting wheat. For example, more than a dozen farmers in Chaoqingli, Kaiping County, Guangdong Province, sold the fields and houses they had been allocated during the land reform and ran to Guangzhou to find work, but as a result, the money ran out and they could not find work. More than 200 young and middle-aged farmers in Xiangtan and Xinhua in Hunan Province abandoned their families' production and ran to Wuhan, but they could not find work, and even the return fare became a problem. In Baqiao Township, Wuming County, Guangxi, more than 100 mu of land were abandoned due to farmers blindly flowing into cities. Therefore, if this phenomenon is not quickly corrected, it will continue to affect agricultural production in the coming winter and spring, causing greater losses to the country and the farmers.
    In order to prevent the continued development of the phenomenon of farmers blindly flowing into cities, the first thing to do is to solve the various ideological problems of farmers. When vigorously publicizing the general line to farmers, all localities should conduct in-depth education in light of the different ideological conditions of farmers, so that they can understand the relationship between national industrialization and agricultural production, understand the development prospects and current tasks of agricultural production, and thus wholeheartedly and actively engage in agricultural production. They should be told that our country is gradually transitioning to socialism, and the general line of the country during the transition period is to gradually realize socialist industrialization, and gradually realize the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts and private industry and commerce. National industrialization is the highest interest of the people of the whole country and is of great benefit to farmers. When the country's industry is developed, it will be able to produce a large number of agricultural machines, new farm implements, chemical fertilizers, and pest control machinery, build more water conservancy projects, and help develop agriculture; it can also build more railways and roads to connect urban and rural areas, sell various agricultural products to cities, and at the same time supply farmers with a large number of industrial products. Industrialization is the cause of the people of the whole country, and it cannot be realized without the support of the people of the whole country, especially without the help of farmers. Because when industry is developed, the number of workers and urban population increases, the amount of grain and agricultural products needed by the state will also increase; and there are also many industrial raw materials, such as cotton, silk, hemp, and beans, which need to be produced by farmers. In order to complete this great task, it is necessary to change the current scattered operation of the small-scale peasant economy, and, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, organize and carry out large-scale production, produce more grain, cotton and other agricultural products, and sell the surplus grain and other agricultural products to the state. This is the great contribution of farmers to national construction, and it is also the path for everyone to live a prosperous life. Therefore, it is a glorious task for farmers to engage in agricultural production in rural areas and support national industrial construction, and the future is bright. At the same time, it is also necessary to explain to the farmers that although the country's large-scale economic construction has already begun this year, our construction is carried out in a planned manner, not "everything is being done at once", but "key construction, steady progress". Therefore, the use and allocation of labor also have certain plans, and it is impossible to accommodate a large number of people all at once. It is not beneficial for farmers to blindly enter the city to find work, either for the country or for themselves. In this regard, some places have begun to pay attention and have made some achievements. For example, after discovering that many members of the Communist Youth League branch of the fifth township of the second district of Wugong County, Shaanxi Province, were not at ease in agricultural production and had the mistaken idea that "only participating in industrial construction has a future, and being a farmer is hopeless", they promptly explained to the members of the League and the general youth the tasks of agricultural production and the development prospects of agricultural production during the period of national economic construction, and conducted specific and in-depth education in response to various different ideological situations. In the mutual aid and cooperation training class held by the CCP Wuchang County Committee in late October, in addition to conducting education on the future of socialism, and in response to the farmers' thinking of wanting to be workers and not wanting to engage in agriculture, they guided everyone to discuss the question of "Can we reach socialism if we only engage in industry and not agriculture?" The people who attended the meeting realized that in addition to industry leading agriculture, industry and agriculture must cooperate and support each other in order to build socialism. The practice of solving the ideological problems of farmers in this way in a timely manner should be adopted by all localities when vigorously publicizing the general line to farmers.
    Secondly, rural cadres in all localities should also carry out some specific organizational work, lead and help farmers further solve the difficulties in production and life. In areas with little land and a large population and a surplus labor force, and in areas where farmers believe that there is "nothing to do" in winter, farmers should be well educated and organized to carry out winter production and process the land, so as to lay a good foundation for increasing grain production next year. For example, carry out processing and management of small spring crops such as wheat, rape, and broad beans, repair land, improve soil, build small-scale water conservancy projects, winter plowing, manure accumulation, and organize various sideline production according to local conditions to increase income, expand production next year, and increase the harvest of agricultural products. For example, under the leadership of the village party branch, the farmers of Sanjiaohe Village in Xiyang, Shanxi, from late October to November 4, had already built 115 zhang of collapsed dams, filled 850 pits washed away by water, and accumulated 16,000 dan of fertilizer. Another example is the Jinhua Special Zone in Zhejiang Province, which has little land and a large population. In the winter and spring of last year and this year, the local party committee led farmers to improve more than 180,000 mu of "rotten fields", saline-alkali soil, and sandy soil by means of ditching and drainage, mixing sand, and mixing soil. This autumn, they generally produced more grain; farmers have learned from their own experience that improving the soil is an important way to tap production potential and increase yield per unit area. Therefore, after the autumn harvest and autumn planting are over, they are actively preparing to continue to improve the soil this winter. In disaster areas, cadres should go deep down and work with the masses to find ways to overcome the famine, and organize the masses to engage in on-site production for self-salvation, so as to avoid them going out blindly. Zhang Wenbo, Zhang Yisen and other four households of Baimi Zhangzhuang in Dongguang County, Hebei Province, felt that there was no way to live after suffering from the flood and were preparing to go out as a family. After Zhu Huanpu, the secretary of the township party branch, and Chen Changjiang, the public security officer of the district, learned about this, they immediately rushed to Baimi Zhangzhuang, on the one hand, to publicize the principles of organizing production for self-salvation to the masses, explaining that going out blindly was not a good way; on the other hand, they went deep to help the disaster victims find ways and make specific plans to overcome the famine. In this way, a total of 81 households in Baimi Zhangzhuang organized 53 households to engage in transportation, weaving and other sideline production, earning 6.09 million yuan in one month, solving the difficulties in life. Zhang Yubo, who originally wanted to go out, said gratefully: "If the cadres had not come up with a way to engage in sideline production for me, I would not even be able to plant wheat if I went out, and my life next year would be a problem." All these facts prove that as long as rural cadres in all localities truly do their work in depth, farmers will dispel the idea of blindly going out and concentrate on agricultural production.
    In addition, factories, mines, enterprises, and construction units in all localities must resolutely implement the "Instructions on Discouraging Farmers from Blindly Flowing into Cities" issued by the State Council of the Central People's Government, strictly abide by the system of unified allocation of labor, and shall not arbitrarily recruit workers or arbitrarily accept farmers without the permission or introduction of the labor department. In view of the serious situation of farmers blindly flowing into cities in the past few months, the Guangxi Provincial People's Government instructed the construction units in the province on November 14 to correct the chaotic phenomenon of unplanned and unorganized use of labor, and instructed governments at all levels to educate farmers to be content with agricultural production and appropriately help farmers solve the difficulties in production and life. This approach is very necessary.
    Discouraging farmers from blindly flowing into cities is not only necessary for national construction work, but also in line with the interests of the farmers themselves. Therefore, as long as we explain the truth to the farmers, make them realize the importance of agricultural production, organize farmers to carry out agricultural and sideline production in a guided manner, and help them solve some specific difficulties, the farmers will wholeheartedly and actively engage in agricultural production, and this phenomenon of blindly flowing into cities can be avoided.

    继续劝止农民盲目流入城市
    何星环
    今年四月中央人民政府政务院发布“关于劝止农民盲目流入城市的指示”以后，经过各方面的重视和努力，农民盲目流入城市的现象曾有一度好转。但据最近读者来信反映，入秋以来，特别是秋收以后，又有不少农民盲目流入城市。如山东武城县西半屯村原有男劳动力一百二十三人，今年九月底就外出了四十五人。河北沧县前营村二百八十六户中，有八十六户的劳动力都出外了。另据河南郑州市人民政府民政科楚荣选来信反映：仅十月底几天之内，从安徽灵璧、江苏铜山、邳睢等地流入郑州南窑、十里铺一带的农民就有三百零九人。
    为什么入秋以来又有许多农民盲目流向城市呢？这有多方面的原因：有些地区遭受自然灾害后，部分农民对生产自救缺乏信心；有些地区地少人多，剩余劳动力没有找到正当出路；有些农民认为秋收秋种结束后农业生产上已经“无事可作”；有些农民，特别是青年农民，对国家工业建设与农业生产的关系认识不清，对发展农业生产的重要性不了解，因而不安心农业生产等等。但问题的主要关键还在于：这些地区的农村干部没有针对农民的思想情况进行耐心的教育，并根据当地具体情况组织他们从事农业、副业生产，帮助他们解决生产、生活上的问题和困难；甚至有些村干部还用一种不负责任的态度，乱开介绍信，随便让农民外出，借以减轻自己的“负担”，因而加深了农民盲目流入城市的混乱现象。如山西宁武县民政科孙博渊、张应德来信反映：山东平阴县三区孙家庄一带就有七、八十个灾民，因为当地政府没有很好地组织他们就地生产自救，就流浪到离家一千八百多里的山西宁武县（宁武县人民政府已设法将这批灾民遣送回籍）。北京市民政局冯万才来信反映：九月份河北、山东等地盲目到北京来找工作的农民中，不少持有当地政府的介绍信，仅山东朝城、观城各村政府开出的就有四十二件。此外，还有一些厂矿企业、建筑单位不经过劳动部门或当地政府，擅自派人到农村招雇工人或随便收用盲目流入城市的农民。如武汉长江日报胡小原、湖北黄陂县十五区公所潘宪武来信反映：中南第二建筑工程公司、华中钢铁公司武昌工地两单位，不通过劳动部门和有关地方政府，利用包工头从湖北黄陂、鄂城、孝感等县招去数百个农民。这种错误做法，在客观上也助长了农民盲目流入城市的混乱现象。
    上述农民盲目流入城市的情况，已经造成了很不好的后果：这不仅增加了城市的剩余劳动力，影响了城市的社会秩序，给城市工作增加了困难；而更主要的是严重地影响了农业生产，造成农民自身的生活困难。许多农民外出时都是把家里的口粮、衣物，甚至耕牛、田地、房屋卖了作路费；有的是地里的秋庄稼没有收、麦子没有种就出来了。如广东开平县潮清里有十多个农民，把土地改革中分得的田地、房屋卖了跑到广州去找工作，结果钱花光了，工作没找到。湖南湘潭、新化等地二百多个青年、壮年农民丢下家里的生产跑到武汉，工作没有找到，连回家的路费都成了问题。广西武鸣县八桥乡甚至因农民盲目流入城市而荒了一百多亩田。因此，这种现象如不迅速纠正，就会继续影响今冬明春的农业生产，给国家和农民带来更大的损失。
    为了防止农民盲目流入城市现象的继续发展，首先应该解决农民的各种思想问题。各地在大张旗鼓向农民宣传总路线的时候，应该针对农民各种不同的思想情况进行深入的教育，使他们认识国家工业化和农业生产的关系，认识农业生产的发展前途和当前的任务，从而安心地积极地从事农业生产。要告诉他们：我们国家正在一步一步过渡到社会主义，国家在过渡时期的总路线就是逐步实现社会主义工业化，逐步实现对农业、手工业和私营工商业的社会主义改造。国家工业化是全国人民的最高利益，对农民有很大的好处。国家工业发达了，就能生产大批的农业机器、新式农具、化学肥料、除虫药械，多修水利，帮助农业发展；才可以多修造铁路、公路沟通城乡关系，把各种农产品销到城市里去，同时把大量的工业品供给农民。工业化是全国人民的事业，它离了全国人民的支援是不能实现的，特别是离不了农民的帮助。因为工业发达了，工人和城市人口增加了，国家需要的粮食和农产品也就要跟着增加；而且还有不少工业原料，像棉花、丝麻、豆类等经济作物，也是需要农民生产的。为了完成这个伟大的任务，必须改变目前小农经济的分散经营现象，按照毛主席的指示，组织起来，进行大规模的生产，多生产粮食、棉花和其它农产品，并把多余粮食和其他农产品卖给国家。这就是农民对国家建设的伟大贡献，也就是使农民大家都过富裕生活的道路。因此，农民在农村进行农业生产，支援国家工业建设，任务是光荣的，前途是远大的。同时还要向农民说明：国家大规模的经济建设虽然今年已经开始，但是我们的建设是有计划地进行的，不是“百废俱兴，齐头并进”，而是“重点建设，稳步前进”。因此对劳动力的使用和调配，也有一定的计划，不可能一下子容纳很多，农民盲目入城找工作，对国家对自己都是不利的。在这方面，有些地方已经开始注意，并做出了一些成绩。如青年团陕西省武功县二区五乡支部在发现不少团员不安心农业生产，存在着“只有参加工业建设才有前途，当农民没出息”的错误思想后，就及时向团员和一般青年普遍讲解了国家经济建设时期农业生产的任务和农业生产的发展前途，并针对着各种不同的思想情况进行了具体深入的教育。中共武昌县委在十月下旬举办的互助合作训练班上，除进行社会主义的前途教育外，并针对着农民想当工人不愿搞农业的思想，引导大家讨论了“光搞工业，不搞农业，能不能到达社会主义？”的问题，使到会的人认识到除了工业要领导农业外，工业、农业还要互相配合、互相支援才能建成社会主义。像这样及时解决农民思想问题的作法，各地在大张旗鼓向农民宣传总路线时应该加以采用。
    其次，各地农村干部还应该进行一些具体的组织工作，领导和帮助农民进一步解决生产和生活中的困难。在地少人多、劳动力有剩余的地区和农民认为冬季“无事可作”的地区，应该很好地教育和组织农民开展冬季生产并对土地进行加工，为明年增产粮食打下良好基础。如对小麦、油菜、蚕豆等小春作物进行加工管理、整修土地、改良土壤、修建小型水利工程、冬耕、积肥，以及因地制宜地组织各种副业生产，以增加收入，扩大明年的生产，增加农产品的收获量。如山西昔阳三教河村农民在该村党支部的领导下，从十月下旬到十一月四日，就已垒起塌?一百一十五丈，填好被水冲成的坑八百五十个，积好肥料一万六千担。又如浙江金华专区地少人多，去冬今春当地党委领导农民以开沟排水、掺沙、和土等办法改良了十八万多亩“烂田”、黏碱土和沙土田，今年秋天普遍多打了粮食；农民已从亲身的体验中，认识到改良土壤是发掘生产潜力和提高单位面积产量的重要办法，因此在秋收秋种结束以后，就积极准备在今冬继续改良土壤。在灾区，干部应该深入下去和群众一起想办法，找渡荒门路，组织群众就地生产自救，以免他们盲目外出。河北省东光县白眉张庄的农民张文波、张义森等四户，遭受水灾后感觉生活无办法，准备全家外出。这乡党的总支书记朱焕普和区治安员陈长江知道后，马上赶到白眉张庄，一方面向群众宣传了组织起来生产自救的道理，说明盲目外出不是好办法；一方面深入帮助灾民想办法，做具体的渡荒计划。这样，白眉张庄共八十一户，就组织起五十三户搞运输、织布等副业生产，一个月就赚了六百零九万元，解决了生活困难。原想外出的张玉波感激地说：“若不是干部给我想出副业生产门路，出去了到现在连麦也种不上，明年生活也成问题。”以上这些事实都证明：只要各地农村干部真正深入地做了工作，农民就会打消盲目外出的思想而安心于农业生产。
    此外，各地厂矿企业和建筑单位也必须坚决执行中央人民政府政务院“关于劝止农民盲目流入城市的指示”，严格遵守劳动力统一调配的制度，未经劳动部门许可或介绍，不得擅自到农村招雇工人或任意收用农民。广西省人民政府根据该省近数月来农民盲目流入城市的严重情况，在十一月十四日指示该省各施工单位纠正使用劳动力无计划、无组织的混乱现象，并指示各级政府教育农民安于农业生产，适当帮助农民解决生产、生活中的困难。这种作法是很必要的。
    劝止农民盲目流入城市，不但对国家建设工作有必要，而且也符合农民本身的利益。因此，只要我们向农民讲清道理，使他们认识到农业生产的重要性，有领导地组织农民进行农、副业生产，并帮助他们解决一些具体困难，农民是会安心地、积极地进行农业生产的，这种盲目流入城市的现象是可以避免的。
