    The United States in South Korea

    A Disguised Plunder of People's Wealth
    According to a United Press International dispatch from Seoul on November 12, the U.S. government is preparing to sign a so-called economic agreement with South Korea. According to this agreement, the South Korean puppet currency "Hwan" will be greatly devalued. The current rate is 60 Hwan to one U.S. dollar, but it will be devalued to 180 Hwan to one U.S. dollar.
    According to UPI, the U.S. military purchases about $500,000 worth of goods from South Korea each month. In this way, for the U.S. military procurement alone, the South Korean people will be robbed of at least 60 million Hwan of wealth each month by the American bandits.

    Extorting Coal Miners
    According to the Seoul puppet "Toyo News Agency," the U.S. coal monopoly in South Korea, "Dae Han Coal Corporation," taking advantage of the arrival of winter, raised coal prices in October by 42 to 63 percent. At the same time, it withheld three months' wages from August to October from workers in its six coal mines in Samcheok, Hwasun, Yeongwol, Danyang, Mungyeong, and Gyeongju.
    The lives of South Korean workers, already miserable due to soaring prices, are driven to desperation by the brutal extortion of the American imperialists.

    Stealing Ancient Cultural Relics
    According to an article by Polevoy in the Soviet "News" magazine, issue 14, the U.S. military in South Korea plundered a large number of ancient cultural relics. The Namsan Museum in Seoul has been looted by U.S. soldiers, and not even a single page remains of the ancient handwritten rare books stored in the library. In addition, more than 300 exquisite ancient porcelains, a golden crown, and a personal letter from Admiral Yi Sun-sin were stolen from the Seoul Central Museum by American robbers. Now South Korea's cultural treasures are either stolen or destroyed, while the U.S. officers are all "rolling in wealth."

    美国在南朝鲜
    变相抢劫人民财富
    据美国国际新闻社汉城十一月十二日电讯报道，现在美国政府正准备和南朝鲜签订所谓经济协定。根据这项协定，将使南朝鲜的伪币“圜”大大贬值。目前是六十圜兑换一元美元，将来要贬到一百八十圜才能兑换一元美元。
    据国际新闻社说，美国军队每月要从南朝鲜采购价值五十万美元左右的物品。这样一来，单单就美军采购这一项来说，南朝鲜人民每月至少要被美国强盗白白地掠走六千万圜的财富。
    勒索煤矿工人
    据汉城伪“东洋通讯社”报道，美国在南朝鲜的煤业垄断公司——“大韩煤炭公司”，乘着冬天的到来，把十月份的煤价提高百分之四十二到六十三，同时又在它属下的三陟、和顺、宁越、丹阳、闻庆和庆州等六个煤矿中，扣发工人八月到十月三个月的工资。
    南朝鲜的工人，在物价飞涨的情况下，生活已苦不堪言，再加上美帝国主义残酷地勒索，生活更陷入绝境。
    偷盗古代文物
    据苏联“新闻”杂志第十四期波列伯里津的文章记载：美国军队在南朝鲜曾掠夺了大批古代文物。现在汉城南山的博物馆已被美国大兵洗劫一空，连图书馆所储存的古代手抄孤本也片纸不存了。另外，还有三百多件精美的古代瓷器、一个黄金王冠和海军大将李舜臣的亲笔信，都被美国强盗从汉城中央博物馆偷去了。现在南朝鲜的文物宝藏，不是被盗窃就是被破坏，而美国军官呢？却个个都是“腰缠万贯”。
