Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 1st—The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC) announced today that the U.S. side's explanation work to non-directly repatriated South Korean, American, and British POWs in the Songgok-ri POW camp in the northern part of the demilitarized zone is scheduled to begin at 9:00 a.m. on December 2nd.

For the past two months, the U.S. side has refused to start explanations to the POWs in the North Camp, concentrating all its efforts on directing the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee secret agents in the South Camp to sabotage the explanation work. During this period, the U.S. side sent a large number of letters to the North Camp to intimidate and coerce American POWs. The NNRC pointed out this act of sabotaging the "Terms of Reference" in a reply to the North Camp POWs' protest on November 28th.

According to the official communiqué released by the NNRC, the explanation work will be conducted individually. POWs who have been explained to and those who have not will be isolated in accordance with Article 20 of the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visits."

The NNRC's decision to isolate the North Camp POWs further proves that the Korean-Chinese side's request to isolate the POWs in the Dongchang-ri POW camp who have listened to the explanations and those who have not is completely justified. This exposes the U.S. side's propaganda lie that the suspension of the explanation work in Dongchang-ri was due to the Korean-Chinese side's request to isolate the POWs. The NNRC's implementation of Article 20 of the "Detailed Rules" in Songgok-ri once again proves that the explanation work in Dongchang-ri was forced to be completely suspended due to the sabotage by the Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee secret agents directed by the United States. These secret agents said that isolating POWs after explanations is an "indirect method" of breaking up their special agent organizations that prevent POWs from being repatriated.

According to the NNRC, the U.S. side's explanation plan requires individual visits to thirty different POWs every day except Sundays. The explanation work will continue until all POWs in the North Camp have listened to the explanations. The U.S. side has requested five explanation locations, with one explanation representative assigned to each location.

The Korean-Chinese side has rapidly provided all the isolation equipment.

The U.S. side's plan to individually explain to POWs and the NNRC's decision on isolation is also a resounding slap in the face to Hamblen, the head of the U.S. "Anti-Repatriation Group," who has continuously attacked the NNRC for agreeing to conduct individual explanations to POWs and called the explanations to the Korean-Chinese prisoners of war "spiritual coercion."

### 美方今日开始向不直接遣返的美方战俘进行解释  我方按照“职权范围”提供隔离战俘的设备

    美方今日开始向不直接遣返的美方战俘进行解释
    我方按照“职权范围”提供隔离战俘的设备
    【新华社开城一日电】中立国遣返委员会今天通知，美方对非军事区北部松谷里战俘营中不直接遣返的南朝鲜、美国和英国战俘的解释工作，定于二日上午九时开始。
    过去两个月中间，美方一直拒绝对北营的战俘开始解释，而集中一切力量来指挥南营中的蒋、李特务破坏解释工作。在这期间，美方曾送交给北营大批邮件以恫吓和胁迫美国战俘。这一破坏“职权范围”的行为，中立国遣返委员会在十一月二十八日答复北营战俘的抗议的一封回信中已予以指出。
    据中立国遣返委员会发布的正式公报说，解释工作将个别进行。经过解释与未经解释的战俘，将按“解释和访问工作细则”第二十款予以隔离。
    中立国遣返委员会关于隔离北营战俘的决定，更加证明朝中方面要求隔离东场里战俘营中已听解释和未听解释的战俘，是完全正当的，这就揭破了美方的宣传谎言：说什么东场里解释工作的停顿是由于朝中方面要求隔离战俘。中立国遣返委员会在松谷里执行“工作细则”第二十款，就再度证明了：东场里的解释工作是因为美国指使下的蒋李特务的破坏而被迫完全停顿的。这些特务们说：在解释后隔离战俘，是打破他们的阻止战俘遣返的特务组织的“间接方法”。
    据中立国遣返委员会说，美方的解释计划要求除星期日外每天个别访问三十名不同的战俘。解释工作将进行到北营全体战俘都听了解释时为止。美方已要求供给五处解释场所，每处派解释代表一名。
    朝中方面已迅速提供了一切隔离设备。
    美方向战俘进行个别解释的计划和中立国遣返委员会关于隔离的决定，也是给美方“反对遣返组”组长汉布伦打了一记响亮耳光，汉布伦曾不断攻击中立国遣返委员会同意向战俘进行个别解释并把对朝中被俘人员进行的解释称为“精神胁迫”。
