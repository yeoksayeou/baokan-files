    Forty Years of Wishes
    Hong Liu
    In Chongqing, people often hear the following song: "Singing of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, the line extends to Chengdu. A forty-year wish has come true, firecrackers echo through the sky. Urban and rural exchange is guaranteed, industry is set for great development! The locomotive puffs smoke, carrying happiness straight ahead..."
    
    The opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has greatly invigorated the Chongqing market. Previously, transporting pigments from Chongqing to Chengdu by truck cost 250,000 yuan per box (approximately 90 kilograms). This discouraged merchants from purchasing in Chongqing. After the railway opened, slow trains charged 60,000 yuan per box, while express trains charged only 120,000 yuan. This encouraged merchants from as far as Bikou on the Sichuan-Gansu border and Xikang to come to Chongqing to buy goods. The transaction volume in the Chongqing market increased by 127.1 percent compared to the period from July to December 1951. Before the railway, sugar was transported by wooden boats. Brown sugar from Huai Zhou in western Sichuan to Chongqing was not only expensive but also took 14 days. As a result, brown sugar from Huai Zhou was rare in the Chongqing market. After the railway opened, transportation by train took only 28 hours and was cheaper. 300,000 kilograms were transported in a very short time, breaking previous records. Before the railway, cotton yarn and cloth were mostly transported by wooden boats. Cotton from Jianyang often took more than a month to reach Chongqing. After the railway opened, it only took three days, and the freight costs were reduced. As a result, the cotton that had been slow to sell in Jianyang quickly became popular, and the cotton urgently needed in the Chongqing market was supplied in time.

    After the opening of the railway, the economic landscape of Chongqing has undergone significant changes. From July to December 1952, the processing orders placed by organizations, groups, and industrial and commercial enterprises in western Sichuan to Chongqing's private industries increased by 4.5 times compared to the same period in 1951, with orders increasing 26-fold. The state-owned and cooperative economies have developed even more rapidly. The Chongqing Materials Exchange Conference, which lasted sixteen days from April 1953, showed that the state-owned and cooperative economies accounted for 65.34 percent of the total transaction volume of 683.7 billion yuan.

    After the railway opened, many highways connecting to the railway were built. Specialty products and medicinal materials from the Sichuan Tibetan Autonomous Region, as well as cattle and sheep hides, can now be transported by trucks on the Wenchuan-Li County section of the Chengdu-Aba Highway (opened on March 15th this year) and then transferred to the railway for transportation to Chongqing. The 34-kilometer road from Dazu County to You Ting has also been opened, allowing grain from Dazu County to be continuously transported to Chongqing. After the highway from Bishan to Degan Dam in Jiangjin was opened, coal, iron, and handicrafts from Bishan could be transported to Chongqing continuously via highways and railways.

    Due to the opening of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, many trucks on the Chengdu-Chongqing Highway, which runs parallel to the railway, have been transferred to highways such as the Sichuan-Guizhou and Sichuan-Yunnan routes. Tung oil and wood oil produced in Zunyi, Guizhou, and Zhaotong, Yunnan, are also transported to Chongqing by truck. At the Chongqing Materials Exchange Conference in April this year, 500 tons of tung oil, 16,500 dan of raw tung oil, and 14,900 dan of wood oil were traded, a portion of which came from Yunnan and Guizhou. After the railway opened, many boats in the Tuo River basin, which runs parallel to the railway, were transferred to rivers in other remote areas to carry goods from those regions. Because the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has become a hub for land and water transportation in Sichuan, the economic relationship between Chongqing and various regions has become even closer.

    四十年来的愿望
    洪流
    在重庆，人们常常可以听到这样的歌声：“歌唱成渝路，通车到成都，四十年的愿望达到了，鞭炮响连天，城乡交流有保障，工业又要大发展！火车头冒着烟，载着幸福直向前……”
    成渝铁路通车，使重庆市场大大活跃起来：以前颜料从重庆用汽车运到成都，每箱（约重九十公斤）运费要二十五万元，因此到重庆市采购的商人很少，通车后，慢班火车每箱运费六万元，快班火车也只十二万元，这样就使远如川甘交界碧口和西康的商人也来重庆买货了，重庆市场的成交额较一九五一年七月到十二月间增加百分之一百二十七点一。食糖在未通车前，用木船装运，淮州红糖由川西运到重庆，不仅运费昂贵，而且需时十四天，因此重庆市场很少有淮州红糖，火车通后，用火车运，只要二十八小时，而且运费便宜，在很短时间里就运来三十万斤，打破以往记录。花纱布在未通车前，大都用木船运输，简阳的棉花，一个多月还不能运到重庆，通车后，只需三天就运到了，而且运价降低，因此简阳滞销的棉花马上畅销，重庆市场迫切需要的棉花也及时得到供应。
    火车通后，重庆市的经济面貌有了显著的变化，一九五二年七月到十二月，川西机关、团体、工商业向重庆市私营工业加工比一九五一年同期增加了四点五倍，订货增加到二十六倍。而国营经济和合作社经济更有了迅速的发展：从一九五三年四月历时十六天的重庆市物资交流大会的结果看，国营经济和合作社经济就占交易总额六千八百三十七亿元的百分之六十五点三四。
    通车后，许多条联结铁路的公路兴筑起来，四川藏族自治区的土特产药材、牛羊皮等已能由今年三月十五日通车的成（都）阿（中阿坝）公路汶（川）理（县）段，用汽车运到铁路线然后再转运到重庆来。大足县到邮亭的三十四公里路也修通了，它使大足县的粮食源源地运到重庆来。壁山到江津德感坝的公路修通后，壁山的煤铁和手工业品都能经公路铁路不间断地运到重庆。
    由于成渝路通车，与它并行的成渝公路上的汽车，大量转调到川黔、川滇等公路去，贵州遵义和云南昭通所产的桐油、木油也都用汽车运到重庆来了。今年四月在重庆市物资交流大会上成交的五百吨桐油，一万六千五百担毛桐油，一万四千九百担木油，有一部分就是滇、黔两地的物资。火车通后，与铁路并行的沱江流域的不少船只都调到其他边远地区的河流去载运边远地区的物资了。由于成渝铁路成为四川境内水陆运输的枢纽，就使得重庆和各地区的经济关系更形密切起来。
