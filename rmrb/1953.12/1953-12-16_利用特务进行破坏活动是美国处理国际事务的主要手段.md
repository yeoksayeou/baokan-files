Using special agents for sabotage activities, wantonly destroying the basic principles of international law, using all open military force or assassination methods, and even using special agent spies to carry out provocations, sabotage, and terrorist activities, and committing all kinds of inhuman atrocities, is the main method used by the United States to handle international affairs. The current use of special agents by the United States in Korea to undermine the explanation work for prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated in various ways is the most obvious example.

Some basic principles of international law that contain progressiveness and democracy, such as the principle of national sovereignty and the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, are still the norms for peaceful coexistence between the two different camps today. In his report to the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Malenkov pointed out:

"The basis of the Soviet Union's policy of peace and the security of all nations is: if there is a desire for mutual cooperation, a willingness to fulfill the obligations undertaken, and if the principles of equality and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries are observed, then the peaceful coexistence and cooperation of capitalism and communism is entirely possible."

The Soviet Union has always pursued a peaceful foreign policy. Thanks to the efforts of the Soviet Union and the peace and democratic forces of various countries, the spirit of the basic principles of international law can be instilled in the United Nations Charter. For example, Article 2 of the United Nations Charter stipulates:

"All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any member or state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations."

"Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state…"

Facts have proved that the Soviet Union attaches great importance to the United Nations as an international cooperation organization, and the Soviet Union fully respects the basic principles of international law. The Soviet Union is the pillar of upholding the principle of national sovereignty and the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. On the contrary, the consistent performance of American foreign policy is to undermine these principles.

Bourgeois international law scholars do not even dare to openly write off these basic principles. For example, Lauterpacht of the United Kingdom said in his revised and expanded Oppenheim's International Law when discussing the issue of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries:

"International law is responsible for the protection of international legal persons. As a rule, interference is prohibited by international law, which is beyond doubt." [1]

However, bourgeois scholars use extremely deceptive sophistry to weaken the significance of these basic principles, and use the so-called "exceptions to the principle" in jurisprudence to destroy the integrity of the principle. Krylov pointed out in the preface to the Russian translation of the first volume of Oppenheim's International Law:

"Lauterpacht tries his best to weaken the significance of national sovereignty. Since sovereignty is the guarantee of national freedom and independence, modern imperialist apologists try to weaken the significance of national sovereignty. Their restriction of national sovereignty is both for the benefit of their planned 'world government' and as if to protect human rights. Lauterpacht follows two directions, on the one hand, he expresses his maintenance of 'international legislation' and the influence of international law on domestic law, and on the other hand, he protects the right of so-called 'humanitarian' intervention." [2]

Thus, "humanity" becomes an excuse to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. Under the smokescreen of "humanity," in the early 19th century, feudal forces raised the banner of "legitimism" to interfere in the French Revolution; in the 1920s, capitalist countries raised the banner of "anti-communism" to carry out armed intervention against the Soviet Union; now American imperialism continues to raise the banner of "anti-communism" and the so-called "free world" to interfere in the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, various people's democratic countries, and the national liberation movements in various colonies. The United States establishes military bases all over the world, playing the role of "world policeman," with the aim of encircling the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries. The United States also uses "aid" as a name to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries everywhere. As far as our country is concerned, the United States has always adopted a policy of interference in the Chinese revolution, and has exhausted all its strength to assist the Kuomintang reactionaries in attacking the Chinese people; after the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the United States has exhausted all its strength to obstruct our country from obtaining its due legitimate status in the United Nations; three years ago, it launched the war of aggression against Korea and forcibly occupied our territory of Taiwan, and economically coerced its servant countries to implement an embargo policy against our country. Due to the efforts of the Korean and Chinese people, the United States suffered a defeat in the Korean War and had to be forced to sign an armistice agreement.

However, the interventionists are not willing to give up because of the failure of the intervention. On the contrary, after the failure of armed intervention, the imperialists are bound to be vicious and unscrupulous, and will not hesitate to take any of the most cruel and despicable means to try to salvage the remnants of the defeat. As a result, another form of intervention appeared, which is to send or buy special agent spies to sneak into the peace and democratic camp to carry out provocations, sabotage, and terrorist activities. The current actions of the United States in using special agents to undermine the explanation work for prisoners of war also belong to this type of intervention.

The late French bourgeois scholar Fauchille pointed out in his international law works when discussing the form of intervention:

"Modern intervention can also be distinguished as open intervention and secret intervention or concealed intervention. The former uses armed forces or puts forward verbal or written diplomatic notes. The latter is more dangerous because it is insidious and hidden, and is carried out by using special agents sent to foreign countries or bought and recruited in foreign countries." [3]

Fauchille, like the British Oppenheim, is also an international law scholar full of reactionary views. His work was published in the 1920s, and his intention in putting forward this view was to slander the Soviet Union. However, this passage has become the most appropriate portrayal of the American intervention policy today.

*　*　*

The United States uses special agent spies to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries or carry out subversive activities, and even openly publicizes it as a theoretical system through shameless professors and scholars. James Burnham, the current professor of philosophy at New York University, is the most prominent example. Burnham came from the Trotskyite bandit gang, and he has successively published a series of extremely reactionary works such as "The Struggle for the World" (1946), "The Coming Defeat of Communism" (1950), and "Containment or Liberation" (1953), putting forward absurd and outrageous propositions.

There is a passage in "The Struggle for the World":

"To crush communism in the Soviet Union and in other countries, rather than starting with a war from the outside, it is better to start from the inside, and we must take the method of starting from the inside." This is the theoretical basis for the United States to use special agent spies to carry out sabotage and subversive activities and interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.

In the so-called "The Coming Defeat of Communism," Burnham devoted an entire chapter to discussing the "bankruptcy of traditional diplomacy." He insisted that there was absolutely no possibility of peaceful coexistence with the socialist camp, and that traditional diplomatic methods could no longer play any role. He vigorously advocated that the United States "fully utilize" the dregs of the old society and collect traitors and scum to carry out sabotage activities against democratic countries. Pierre Goutard, a reporter for the French newspaper "L'Humanité," pointed out:

"Burnham's central argument can be summarized as follows: to attack on all fronts by means of conspiracy, subversion, bribery, limited wars, and even, finally, a full-scale war." [4]

"Containment or Liberation" was published in January 1953. At that time, Eisenhower, Dulles, and others were clamoring to carry out "liberation" from within the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and various people's democratic countries. In this book, Burnham explained that the "containment policy" had failed and must be replaced by the "liberation policy starting from the inside" that he had consistently advocated. He said in this book:

"The liberation policy must be carried out from the main aspects of military, economic, psychological, diplomatic, and political aspects. It is neither simple nor unearned, and it is even less possible to immediately expect magical achievements."

Burnham demanded that the United States intensify its subversive activities against the countries of Eastern Europe, while also not relaxing its special agent sabotage activities against Western Europe and the Far East, especially against the People's Republic of China. Burnham fantasized:

"A large-scale internal action may achieve the purpose of overthrowing the enemy, that is, overthrowing the Soviet system. To obtain the greatest effect at the smallest cost."

"Ten people lurking behind enemy lines are better than a hundred, or even a thousand, people in front of the enemy."

In short, Burnham's proposition is actually the common proposition of the American war mongers. Their views are inseparable from the original purpose: that is, to regard the use of special agent spies to carry out sabotage and subversive activities as a panacea for anti-communism, anti-Soviet Union, anti-People's Republic of China, and anti-people's democratic countries.

In order to realize the "principles" advocated by Burnham and others, US President Truman signed the notorious so-called "Mutual Security Act" on October 10, 1951. This act included the Kersten Amendment, which reads as follows:

"A sum not exceeding $100 million shall be provided to selected qualified personnel residing in the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia or in the areas under communist rule or occupied by the Communist Party in the two countries of Germany and Austria, or fleeing from such countries, to form an army supporting the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; or when the President similarly determines that such assistance is conducive to the defense of the North Atlantic region and the security of the United States, it shall be used for other purposes."

Vishinsky filed a complaint with the United Nations on this matter in December 1951. Vishinsky emphasized the following points at the United Nations General Assembly:

1. The United States openly interferes in the internal affairs of other countries;
2. The United States shamefully destroys the principles of international law;
3. The United States openly violates the obligations stipulated in the United Nations Charter;
4. The United States admits that it is the culprit for worsening international relations, especially relations between Eastern and Western Europe;
5. The United States attempts to use US dollars to buy special agent spies to form subversive organizations and separatist groups to carry out armed riots against the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries, in order to achieve the goal of overthrowing these countries.

Vishinsky's proposal revealed the essence of the US "Mutual Security Act" and ruthlessly pointed out the US conspiracy to use special agent spies to carry out despicable aggressive activities.

In fact, the cost of the United States carrying out special agent sabotage activities around the world is more than just the one hundred million US dollars of the "Mutual Security Act." For example, on June 23 this year, the United Press International revealed that "the US government has secretly obtained preliminary consent from Congress to allocate funds to support Asian anti-communist underground organizations." Over the years, the various large and small special agent spy sabotage and subversive activities carried out by the United States in the Eastern European people's democratic countries and our China are really too numerous to mention. The scale of the Berlin provocation incident in June this year is unprecedented in the history of international relations. And the current degree of frenzy in which the United States uses special agents in Korea to control prisoners of war with terrorist rule and arbitrarily undermine the explanation work is also unprecedented in the history of international relations.

All this shows that the reactionary special agent theory of the United States has become the central idea of American foreign policy, and it is further openly manifested in government decrees, budgets, and various activities.

In the 17th century, de Callières said: "Diplomats are spies of honor"; scholars in the rising period of the bourgeoisie still doubted or criticized this sentence, but the US State Department took this sentence as the main criterion for selecting diplomats.

In the various sabotage and subversive crimes discovered in people's democratic countries, many American diplomats are involved. The current US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles is a notorious anti-communist and anti-Soviet special agent leader. He vigorously advocates sending special agent spies to the socialist camp to carry out sabotage and subversive activities and implement the so-called "liberation from within" policy. His brother Allen Dulles is a famous special agent leader and is currently the director of the US Central Intelligence Agency. Walter Bedell Smith has always been engaged in the intelligence work of the US Navy, served as the US ambassador to the Soviet Union, succeeded as the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and is currently the Deputy Secretary of State. Annabelle Bucar revealed his special agent crimes in her book "The Truth About American Diplomats." Former US ambassador to the Soviet Union George Kennan is a notorious anti-Soviet expert who used to work under the special agent leader Robinson and specialized in espionage work against the Soviet Union. Pike's book "Anti-Peace Conspiracy" mentioned him. As for his successor, the current US ambassador to the Soviet Union Bohlen is also his peer. And the current US ambassador to Thailand, Donovan, is an even more famous special agent leader. He presided over the US Strategic Intelligence Bureau during World War II. He has close ties with the Wall Street monopoly capital group. During World War II, he personally presided over the dispatch of special agent spies to infiltrate the internal affairs of the anti-German front in various countries to carry out sabotage and subversive activities. These guys are the planners and executors of the American special agent policy, and they are also the planners and executors of American "foreign policy."

The theory of special agents, the laws of special agents, the budget of special agents, the diplomats of special agents, plus the countless special agent bandits collected all over the world, all this is the concentrated expression of American foreign policy.

In summary, this is exactly what Malenkov pointed out in his speech at the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union:

"Such large-scale subversive activities, such blatant interference in the internal affairs of other countries, and such systematic launching of international provocations as are now being carried out by the aggressive forces have never been seen in the history of international relations.

Things have reached such a point that some American groups have elevated subversive activities against the legitimate governments of sovereign states to the level of government policy. For this purpose, the US federal budget has allocated huge sums of money to collect bandits from the dregs of society who engage in subversive activities and send them to democratic countries to carry out sabotage activities. For this purpose, a set of government organizations has been established to launch international provocations one after another, and to carry out the worship of force and the propaganda of hatred for peace-loving countries."

Things have reached such a point that the United States' special agent sabotage methods have been integrated into the entire American foreign policy and have been regarded as the standard for interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and handling all international affairs. In Korea, in order to forcibly detain prisoners of war and undermine the explanation work, the United States also openly used Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee special agent bandits to commit many inhuman and appalling atrocities. Regarding special agent spies as a secret weapon for carrying out the "Cold War" and treating "prisoners of war" as a tool for carrying out the "Cold War" is by no means a sign of the enemy's strength. Nazi Germany was the country that was best at using the special agent sabotage policy. The so-called "fifth column" is well-known, and the ending is the complete collapse of Nazi Germany, which is also well-known.

However, the imperialists are never willing to give up their failure. In this sharp struggle, we must raise our vigilance. Chairman Mao taught us long ago in his opening speech at the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference:

"The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never be reconciled to their failure, and they will make a final struggle. After the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways, and they will try to restore China every day and every hour. This is inevitable, without a doubt, and we must not relax our vigilance."

We must keep in mind Chairman Mao's teachings, pay attention to the enemy's conspiracies at all times, expose the enemy's crimes, and raise our vigilance.

    利用特务进行破坏活动是美国处理国际事务的主要手段
    凌其翰
    恣意破坏国际法的基本原则，运用一切公开武力或暗害手段，甚至利用特务间谍来进行挑衅、破坏和恐怖活动，做出种种灭绝人性的暴行，这是美国处理国际事务的主要方法。目前美国在朝鲜利用特务从多方面破坏对于不直接遣返的战俘的解释工作，就是最明显的例子。
    国际法中若干含有进步性、民主性的基本原则，例如国家主权原则和不干涉他国内政的原则，即在今天两个不同阵营之间，仍然是和平共处的准则。马林科夫在苏联共产党第十九次代表大会上的报告中指出：
    “苏联所奉行的和平与各族人民的安全的政策的根据是：如果有着互相合作的愿望，有着履行所承担的义务的意愿，而且平等与不干涉他国内政的原则得到遵守，那末资本主义与共产主义的和平共存和合作就是十分可能的。”
    苏联一贯奉行和平外交政策。由于苏联和各国和平民主力量的努力，国际法基本原则的精神才能灌注在联合国宪章里。例如联合国宪章第二条规定：
  “各会员国在其国际关系上不得使用威胁或武力，或以与联合国宗旨不符之任何其他方法，侵害任何会员国或国家之领土完整或政治独立。”
   “本宪章不得认为授权联合国干涉在本质上属于任何国家内管辖之事件……。”
    事实证明，苏联十分重视作为国际合作机构的联合国，苏联十分尊重国际法的基本原则。苏联是拥护国家主权原则和不干涉他国内政原则的支柱。恰恰相反，美国外交政策上的一贯表现即在破坏这些原则。
    资产阶级国际法学者还不敢明目张胆地把这些基本原则一笔勾销。例如英国劳特派特在其增编的奥本海国际法中论到不干涉他国内政的问题时说：
   “国际法对于国际的法人负保护之责，作为规律而言，干涉被国际法所禁止，那是没有疑问的。”〔一〕
    然而资产阶级学者却用极端含有欺骗性的诡辩来削弱这些基本原则的意义，用法学上所谓“原则的例外”来破坏原则的完整性。克利洛夫在奥本海国际法俄文译本第一卷序文中指出：
  “劳特派特想尽方法来削弱国家主权的意义。由于主权是国家自由和独立的保障，现代帝国主义的辩护者就试图削弱国家主权的意义，他们的限制国家主权既是为了有利于他们所策划的‘世界政府’，又好像是为了保障人权。劳特派特按照两个方向，一方面表示维护‘国际立法’和国际法对国内法的影响，另一方面又保护所谓‘人道’干涉的权利。” 〔二〕
    于是“人道”就成为干涉他国内政的藉口。在“人道”的烟幕下，十九世纪初期，封建势力举起“正统主义”的旗帜来干涉法国革命；二十世纪二十年代，资本主义各国举起“反共”的旗帜来对苏联实施武装干涉；现在美帝国主义继续举起“反共”和所谓“自由世界”的旗帜来干涉苏联、中华人民共和国、各人民民主国家以及各殖民地的民族解放运动。美国在世界各处建立军事基地，充任“世界宪兵”的角色，其目的在包围苏联和各人民民主国家。美国并以“援助”为名，到处干涉他国的内政。仅就我国而言，美国对中国革命始终采取干涉政策，曾用尽了一切力量援助国民党反动派来进攻中国人民；在中华人民共和国成立以后，美国又用尽一切力量阻挠我国在联合国取得应有的合法地位；三年前又发动侵朝战争并强占我国领土台湾，并在经济上胁逼它的仆从国家对我国实施禁运政策。由于朝中人民的努力，美国在朝鲜战争中遭受了失败，不得不被迫签订了停战协定。
    但干涉者并不因干涉失败而甘休，恰恰相反，帝国主义者于武装干涉失败以后，势必穷凶极恶，不惜采取任何最残酷、最卑鄙的手段，来试图挽回失败的残局。于是，另一种干涉的形式出现了，这就是派遣或收买特务间谍潜入和平民主阵营来进行挑衅、破坏和恐怖活动。目前美国利用特务破坏对战俘的解释工作的行动，也是属于这一干涉的类型。
    法国已故的资产阶级学者福希尔在其所著国际法著作中论到干涉形式时曾指出：
    “现代干涉还可区别为公开的干涉和暗中的干涉或隐蔽的干涉。前者使用武装力量或提出口头或书面的外交照会。后者更危险了，因为它是阴险的，并且是暗藏的，是利用派遣到外国去的，或在外国收买招募的特务而进行的。”〔三〕
    福希尔和英国奥本海一样，也是充满着反动观点的国际法学者。他的著作是在二十年代出版的，他提出这个观点的用意在诬蔑苏联，然而，这段却成了今天美国干涉政策最恰当的写照。
                          *　*　*
    美国利用特务间谍来干涉他国内政或进行颠覆活动，竟通过无耻的教授学者，作为一种理论体系而公开宣传了。现任纽约大学哲学教授詹姆斯·贝恩海姆就是其中最突出的典型。贝恩海姆是托派匪帮出身，他曾先后发表了“为统治世界而斗争”（一九四六年）、“共产主义快要垮台”（一九五○年）、“遏制政策或解放政策”（一九五三年）等一系列反动透顶的著作，提出荒谬绝伦的主张。
    “为统治世界而斗争”一书中有一段话：
    “在苏联和在其他各国进行粉碎共产主义，与其从外部而来的战争着手，无宁从内部着手，而我们必须采取从内部着手的办法。”这就是美国利用特务间谍来进行破坏、颠覆活动，干涉他国内政的理论根据。
    在所谓“共产主义快要垮台”一书中，贝恩海姆以整章的篇幅论证了“传统外交的破产”，他硬说对社会主义阵营决无和平共处的可能，传统的外交方法已不能发生任何作用。他极力主张美国“充分地利用”旧社会的渣滓，收集叛徒败类来向民主国家进行破坏活动。法国“人道报”记者皮埃尔·古达德指出：
    “贝恩海姆的中心主张可以概括表述如下：用阴谋、颠覆、贿赂、局限性的战争、甚至最后用全面的战争来，在一切战线上进攻。”〔四〕
    “遏制政策或解放政策”一书是在一九五三年一月间出版的。那时艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯等正叫嚣着要从苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家内部进行“解放”。贝恩海姆在这本书中说明“遏制政策”已告失败，必须由他一贯主张的“从内部着手的解放政策”来代替。他在这本书中说：
    “解放政策必须从军事、经济、心理、外交和政治各主要方面进行。它既不是简单的，也不是不劳而获的，更不能立刻期待魔术似的成就。”
    贝恩海姆要求美国加紧进行对东欧各国的颠覆活动，同时也不放松对西欧和远东，特别是对中华人民共和国的特务破坏活动。贝恩海姆幻想道：
    “一个大规模的内部行动可能达到推翻敌人的目的，即推翻苏维埃制度。以最小的代价，获得最大的效果。”
    “潜伏敌后十人，胜过敌前百人，甚至千人。”
    总而言之，贝恩海姆的主张，其实就是美国战争贩子们的共同主张，他们的看法万变不离其宗：就是把利用特务间谍来进行破坏颠覆活动当成反共、反苏、反中华人民共和国以及反各人民民主国家的万应药方。
    为着实现贝恩海姆等人主张的那些“原则”，美国总统杜鲁门在一九五一年十月十日签署了臭名远扬的所谓“共同安全法案”。这个法案包括了一个克尔斯坦修正案，原文如下：
    “以不超过一亿元之数，供给在苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚、立陶宛、拉脱维亚、爱沙尼亚或德奥二国内受共产党统治或由共产党占领的区域，以及被苏联吸引的其他国家境内居住或自此等国家逃出的经选定的合格人员，组成支持北大西洋公约组织的军队；或当总统同样认定这种援助有助于北大西洋区域的防御及美国的安全时，则供其他用途。”
    维辛斯基曾为此事于一九五一年十二月向联合国提出控诉。维辛斯基曾在联合国大会上着重指出下列几点：
    一  美国公然干涉他国内政；
    二  美国可耻地破坏了国际法的原则；
    三  美国公然违反了联合国宪章所规定的义务；
    四  美国招认了它是恶化国际关系、特别是东西欧关系的罪魁祸首；
    五  美国妄图以美元收买特务间谍的颠覆组织、分裂集团来向苏联和人民民主国家进行武装暴动，以期达到推翻这些国家的目的。
    维辛斯基的提案揭露了美国“共同安全法案”的实质，无情地指出了美国利用特务间谍，进行卑鄙的侵略活动的阴谋。
    其实美国在世界各地进行特务破坏活动的费用，何止“共同安全法案”的一亿美元。例如今年六月二十三日，美国合众社透露说：“美国政府秘密地取得了国会对拨款支持亚洲反共地下组织的初步同意。”历年以来，美国在东欧人民民主国家和我们中国所进行的各种大大小小的特务间谍破坏颠覆活动实在是不胜枚举。今年六月的柏林挑衅事件其规模之大，在国际关系史上是空前的。而目前美国在朝鲜利用特务以恐怖统治来控制战俘并恣意破坏解释工作，其猖狂的程度，在国际关系史上也是空前的。
    这一切说明了美国反动的特务理论已经成为美国对外政策的中心思想，并且进一步公然表现于政府的法令、预算和各种各样的活动上了。
    十七世纪德·加里埃尔有一句话：“外交官是荣誉的间谍”；资产阶级上升时期的学者们还对这句话发生怀疑或加以指摘，然而美国国务院却拿这句话当做选择外交官的主要标准。
    在人民民主国家中所发现的种种破坏颠覆罪行中，就有不少美国外交官牵涉在内，美国现任国务卿约翰·福斯特·杜勒斯就是一位臭名远扬的反共反苏的特务头子，他极力鼓吹派遣特务间谍到社会主义阵营去进行破坏颠覆活动，实施所谓“从内部解放”的政策。他的兄弟艾伦·杜勒斯就是一位出名的特务头子，现任美国中央情报局局长。华尔特·贝德尔·史密斯一向从事美国海军的谍报工作，曾任美国驻苏大使，继任中央情报局长，现任副国务卿，安娜贝尔·布卡尔在“美国外交官真相”一书中曾揭露了他的特务罪行。前任驻苏大使乔治·凯南是一位臭名远扬的反苏专家，原在特务头子鲁滨逊手下专做对苏的谍报工作。派克著的“反和平阴谋”一书曾提到了他。至于他的后任，即现任美国驻苏大使波伦也是他的同行伙伴。而现任驻泰国大使杜诺万更是一位鼎鼎大名的特务头子，第二次大战时的美国战略情报局就是他所主持的，他和华尔街的垄断资本集团有密切的联系。在二次大战中，他一手主持派遣特务间谍渗入各国抗德阵线的内部来进行破坏颠覆的活动。这班家伙们就是美国特务政策的策划者和执行者，也就是美国“外交政策”的策划者和执行者。
    特务的理论，特务的法令，特务的预算，特务的外交官再加上在世界各地所搜罗的无数的特务匪徒，这一切就是美国外交政策的集中表现。
    总上所述，这正是马林科夫在苏联最高苏维埃第五次会议上的演说中所指出的：
    “像侵略力量现在所进行的这样大规模的颠覆活动，这样露骨地干涉其他国家的内政，这样有系统地发动国际挑衅，在国际关系史上是从来没有过的。
    事情到了这样的地步：一些美国集团竟把对主权国家的合法政府进行的颠覆活动，提高到政府政策的水平。为了这个目的，美国联邦预算拨出了巨额款项，来从社会渣滓中搜罗从事颠覆活动的匪徒，把他们派到民主国家进行破坏活动。为了这个目的，建立了一套政府组织，专门一个接着一个地发动国际挑衅，进行武力崇拜和仇恨爱好和平国家的宣传。”
    事情到了这样的地步，美国的特务破坏手段竟贯串了美国对外政策的整体，被奉为干涉他国内政，处理一切国际事务的圭臬。美国在朝鲜为了强迫扣留战俘、破坏解释工作，也公然利用蒋李特务匪徒作出许多灭绝人性、惨不忍闻的暴行。视特务间谍为进行“冷战”的秘密武器，把“战俘”也作为进行“冷战”的工具，这决不是敌人强大的标志。纳粹德国是最善于利用特务破坏政策的国家，所谓“第五纵队”是人所周知的，结局却是纳粹德国的全部崩溃，这也是人所周知的。
    然而帝国主义决不甘心于他们的失败的，我们在这样尖锐斗争的时候，必须提高我们的警惕性。毛主席在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议上的开幕辞中早已教导我们：
   “帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”
    我们务必好好记牢毛主席的教诲，随时注意敌人的阴谋，揭露敌人的罪行，提高我们的警惕性。
