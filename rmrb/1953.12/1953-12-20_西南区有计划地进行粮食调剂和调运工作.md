Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, December 18th: Farmers in various parts of the Southwest Region, who have achieved a bumper harvest, are eagerly paying their agricultural tax and selling surplus grain to the state. Farmers in Sichuan, where surplus grain is abundant, sold 45.55 percent more surplus grain to the state in November than in October. The total grain purchase volume in the Southwest Region in November also increased by 58.78 percent compared to October. Currently, 64 percent of the region's agricultural tax grain has been put into storage.

In order to ensure that this grain is well arranged and that cities and industrial and mining areas have sufficient grain, the Southwest Region's grain departments, under the unified command of the central government, are systematically carrying out grain allocation and transportation work. In Sichuan Province, more than 14,000 wooden boats are participating in grain transportation on the seventy-seven crisscrossing rivers, large and small. Chongqing, the industrial center of the Southwest, sees the arrival of many grain ships from the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers every day. Grain from Qujing and Yiliang prefectures in Yunnan is systematically and steadily supplied to the Gejiu mining area and the Dongchuan copper mining area. The famous Zigong well salt area in Sichuan also receives ample grain supply from Luzhou and Yibin prefectures.

    西南区有计划地进行粮食调剂和调运工作
    【新华社重庆十八日电】获得丰收的西南各地农民争先恐后地缴纳公粮和向国家出售余粮。余粮充足的四川农民十一月份卖给国家的余粮，比十月份增加百分之四十五点五五。十一月份西南全区粮食收购量也比十月份增加了百分之五十八点七八。目前全区公粮已有百分之六十四入仓。
    为了使这些粮食得到很好安排，城市和工矿区有充足的粮食，西南区粮食部门在中央的统一指挥下正有计划地进行粮食调剂、调运工作。四川省内七十七条纵横交错的大小河道，参加运粮的木船达一万四千多只。西南工业中心的重庆市，每天都要到达许多从长江、嘉陵江驶来的粮船。云南曲靖、宜良专区的粮食有计划地源源供应个旧矿区和东川铜矿区。四川著名的自贡井盐区也充分得到泸州、宜宾专区粮食的供应。
