Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 19th: Li Shunda, a renowned agricultural labor model and director of the Xigou Village Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Ping顺 County, Shanxi Province, is actively promoting the general line to the broad masses of peasants and taking the lead in selling surplus grain.

After Li Shunda attended the enlarged cadre meeting convened by the Ping顺 County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and listened to the report from the county committee leaders on the transmission of the general line, he recalled the process of his village's peasants organizing to escape poverty and gradually become prosperous. He also recalled his visit to the Soviet Union last year, where he witnessed the happy lives of Soviet collective farmers, and thus realized the important significance of the general line. After the meeting, he actively promoted the general line. He gave seven reports on the production and living conditions of Soviet collective farmers at meetings of cadres and party members at the county, district, township, and village levels. On December 10th, he made a recorded speech on Shanxi People's Broadcasting Station entitled "How I Transformed from Poor to Rich by Following the Path of Mutual Aid and Cooperation," which was broadcast to peasants throughout the province. Li Shunda also went deep into each household in his village to help peasants understand the meaning of the general line. Some people, after hearing Li Shunda's introduction of the use of small machines for farming in Soviet mountainous areas, dispelled their doubts that mountainous areas could not achieve socialism. Farmer Wei Lixing had a vague understanding of selling surplus grain. After Li Shunda explained it, he not only eliminated his concerns but also voluntarily sold 400 jin of surplus grain and requested to join the agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperative.

Because Li Shunda recognized the benefits of national industrialization for peasants, he actively sold all 1,300 jin of his surplus grain to the state. Li Shunda's patriotic actions moved many peasants. 社员 Zhang Xiaobian, who originally planned to sell only 800 jin of grain, sold an additional 700 jin. The entire cooperative, originally planning to sell 9,000 jin of surplus grain from 48 households, increased it to more than 14,000 jin; the entire township also increased from 45,000 jin to 55,000 jin.

After studying the general line, Li Shunda is determined to run the agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperative well. According to the general demands of the masses, he has formulated a preliminary plan to expand the cooperative: Based on local natural conditions, he plans to establish two to three branch cooperatives in Nansai, Chidi, and other villages, with Xixiang Village as the main base, expanding from the current 48 households to a large cooperative of 150 households.

    李顺达积极宣传总路线并带头出卖余粮
    【新华社太原十九日电】著名农业劳动模范——山西省平顺县西沟村农林畜牧生产合作社社长李顺达，积极向广大农民群众宣传总路线，并带头出售余粮。
    当李顺达参加了中共平顺县委召开的扩大干部会议，并听取了县委负责同志关于总路线的传达报告后，回忆了自己村庄的农民组织起来摆脱穷困逐渐富余的经过，回忆了去年赴苏联参观看到苏联集体农民的幸福生活，因此认识到总路线的重要意义。会后，他就积极地宣传总路线。他在县、区、乡、村各级干部党员会议上，做了七次关于苏联集体农民生产生活情况的报告。十二月十日，又在山西人民广播电台作了“我是怎样走互助合作道路由穷变富的”演讲录音，向全省农民广播。李顺达并深入本村各户，帮助农民了解总路线的意义。有些人听了李顺达介绍苏联山地使用小型机器耕作，解决了山地不能到社会主义的怀疑。农民魏礼兴对出卖余粮认识模糊，经李顺达解释后，不仅消除顾虑，还自动出售余粮四百斤，并要求加入农林畜牧生产合作社。
    李顺达由于认识到国家工业化对农民的好处，积极把全部余粮一千三百斤出售给国家。李顺达的爱国行动感动了许多农民。原来打算只出售八百斤粮食的社员张小变，又多出售了七百斤。全社四十八户原计划出售余粮九千斤，以后增加到一万四千多斤；全乡也由四万五千斤增加到五万五千斤。
    李顺达学习了总路线后，决心全力办好农林畜牧生产合作社。根据群众的普遍要求，他已订出了扩大合作社的初步计划：根据当地自然条件，准备以西乡村为主，在南赛、池底等村发展两个至三个分社，由现在的四十八户扩大至一百五十户的大社。
