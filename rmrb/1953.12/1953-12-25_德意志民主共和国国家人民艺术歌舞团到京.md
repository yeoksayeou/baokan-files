    Deputy Minister of Culture Liu Zhiming delivered a welcome speech. He said: We are all familiar with Goethe, Heine, Beethoven, Bach, and Schubert as great German artists. The German Democratic Republic has an excellent national tradition in culture and art. Through the performances of the art song and dance troupe in China, we will see the hardworking and courageous qualities of the German people; we will see the determination of the German people to strive for a unified, independent, democratic, and peace-loving new Germany in socialist construction. The cultural and artistic exchanges between our two peoples strengthen the political support between our two countries. At the same time, it also demonstrates the solidarity of the socialist and democratic peace camp headed by the Soviet Union, and our strong will to fight against the imperialist aggressive camp.

    Professor Pischner, head of the art song and dance troupe, also spoke at the welcoming ceremony. He said: In our big family of socialist and democratic countries, in our common struggle against the imperialist warmongers and their lackeys, the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic are standing on the front lines. In this struggle, art is an indispensable and powerful weapon, and art also makes the relationship between our two peoples even closer. The Chinese Youth Art Troupe gave outstanding performances in Germany. Our art song and dance troupe recognizes the glorious significance of the task of performing in China, and we must do our best to successfully complete this task. Professor Pischner also paid tribute to the people of Beijing on behalf of the people of Berlin and all the working people of the Democratic Germany.

    The art song and dance troupe will hold visiting performances in Beijing and will visit various parts of our country for performances.
