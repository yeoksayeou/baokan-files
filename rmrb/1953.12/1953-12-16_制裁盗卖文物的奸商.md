Short commentary:

    Across China's vast land, from Gaochang and Kuqa in Xinjiang, Dunhuang and the Maijishan Grottoes in Gansu, the Bingling Temple discovered after liberation in Yongjing, the Yungang Grottoes in Datong, the Tianlongshan Grottoes in Taiyuan, the Longmen Grottoes in Luoyang, the North and South Xiangtangshan Grottoes in the Fengfeng Mining Area, the Thousand Buddha Mountain in Jinan, to the Wanfo Temple in Yixian, stand a series of magnificent grotto temples. These grotto temples are rich in exquisite statues or sculptures or murals, which are brilliant masterpieces in the history of Chinese art and important cultural heritage of our country.
    In the past few decades, like other ancient cultural relics, most of these grotto temples have become targets of plunder by imperialists, especially American imperialists. Warner peeled off the Tang Dynasty murals and Tang Dynasty donor portraits from the Dunhuang Thousand Buddha Caves. The Northern Qi and Tang Dynasty statues in Tianlongshan were almost entirely destroyed by the奸商 (jian shang, treacherous merchant) Ni Yushu and sold to the Yamanaka Shokai in Japan, most of which were resold to American imperialist elements. The most famous Yungang Grottoes and Longmen Grottoes were also thoroughly destroyed through the collusion of imperialist elements, the reactionary government at the time, and antique奸商 (jian shang, treacherous merchants).
    The case of antique dealer Yue Bin stealing and selling sculptures and reliefs from the Longmen Binyang Cave, etc., revealed in today's third edition of this newspaper, is another typical example. At that time, American imperialist elements took photos in Longmen and specifically requested the outstanding Northern Wei sculpture "Empress Worshipping Buddha" and other famous sculptures. Yue Bin signed a contract with him, guaranteeing to steal and chisel down such precious cultural heritage within five years. Yue Bin colluded with the local reactionary government, unscrupulously breaking the 1,400-year-old artistic masterpieces into pieces of various sizes, which were then glued together and transported out. Today, one side of the famous relief "Empress Worshipping Buddha" in Binyang Cave is displayed in the New York City Museum. Such serious crimes of stealing and selling cultural relics should be sanctioned by law.
    In order to strengthen the protection of cultural relics, it is necessary to widely publicize the series of laws and regulations on the protection of cultural relics promulgated by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, and to inspire the enthusiasm of the broad masses of people to cherish cultural relics. Our country is a country with a long history and culture. In addition to grotto temples, there are many ancient buildings, ancient tombs, and ancient cultural sites distributed throughout the country, and there are also many revolutionary, historical, and artistic cultural relics and books scattered everywhere, which must be protected. As long as everyone cherishes and protects cultural relics, imperialist elements and antique奸商 (jian shang, treacherous merchants) will have no chance to take advantage of them.

### 制裁盗卖文物的奸商

    制裁盗卖文物的奸商
    在我国辽阔的土地上，从新疆的高昌、库车，甘肃的敦煌，天水的麦积山，解放后发现的永靖炳灵寺，大同的云岗，太原的天龙山，洛阳的龙门，峰峰矿区的南北向堂山，济南的千佛山，到义县的万佛堂，矗立着一连串壮丽的石窟寺。这些石窟寺都有丰富的精美雕像或塑像或壁画，是我国艺术史上的光辉杰作，是我国重要的文化遗产。
    在过去的几十年间，跟其它古代文物一样，这些石窟寺大半都成为帝国主义者特别是美帝国主义者的掠夺对象。华尔纳剥取了敦煌千佛洞的唐代壁画和唐代供养人像。天龙山的北齐和唐代造像，几乎全部为奸商倪玉书所破坏而卖给日本山中商会，其中大半转卖给美帝国主义分子了。最著名的云岗石窟、龙门石窟，也在帝国主义分子、当时的反动政府和古玩奸商的相互勾结下，被彻底破坏了。
    今天本报三版所揭发的古玩商岳彬盗卖龙门宾阳洞等的雕像和浮雕事件，又是一个典型的例子。当时美帝国主义分子在龙门照了相，指名要杰出的北魏雕刻“王后礼佛图”及其它著名雕刻。岳彬就和他订立契约，保证在五年内把那么珍贵的文化遗产盗凿下来。岳彬勾结当地反动政府，肆无忌惮地把一千四百年前的艺术杰作打成大小碎片，经过粘对运出。如今宾阳洞著名的浮雕“王后礼佛图”的一面，就摆在纽约市博物馆里。这样盗卖文物的严重罪行应该受到法律的制裁。
    为了加强文物保护工作，必须广泛宣传中央人民政府政务院所颁布的一系列保护文物的法令，激发广大人民爱护文物的热情。我国是一个文化悠久的国家，除了石窟寺以外，全国分布着许多古建筑、古墓葬、古文化遗址，流散各处的有关革命、历史、艺术的文物图书也很不少，必须加以保护。只要大家爱护文物、保护文物，帝国主义分子和古玩奸商就无隙可乘了。
