    The General Line Illuminates the Path for Peasants to Take the Socialist Road
    I Understood Why Peasants Must Accept Socialist Transformation
    He Yuanliang, Township Head of Jiujian Township, Wuchang County
    I am a Communist Party member and the township head of Jiujian Township in Wuchang County, Hubei Province. When I studied the General Line and learned that agriculture should be gradually transformed through socialist means, I couldn't quite grasp it. I thought: Peasants suffered greatly in the old society and actively joined the army and delivered grain when fighting Chiang Kai-shek. Peasants are always at the forefront, so why do they need to be transformed now? Later, after listening to reports from leading comrades and after repeated discussions, I connected these issues with the actual situation of the peasants in my township, and my mind became clear. Take myself as an example. The mutual aid team I led produced more than 70 shih of extra grain this year. Not only did I not allow the team members to sell it to the state immediately, but I wanted to hoard it and sell it at a high price in the spring. I even deceived the bank and took out a loan of one million yuan to engage in speculative business. Why did I want to do this? To be honest, it was to make money and get rich for myself. In our township, eight poor and lower-middle peasant households in one large team had to sell their land, and thirty households in the whole township were secretly or openly lending money at high interest rates. Farmer Xin Congbin, due to natural disasters and financial difficulties, borrowed two shih of grain from Xin Duansheng and mortgaged one dou and one sheng of his land to Xin Duansheng in less than two years. Grain trafficking is even more common in our township. There are fifteen cadres involved, and even more ordinary people. Guo Desheng, the deputy township head, doesn't focus on work or production but specializes in trafficking soybeans, wheat, and grain. Team leader Tian Tuhong doesn't focus on mutual aid team work but engages in grain business. When asked to attend meetings to discuss production, he said, "You can remove me from my cadre position, but the business must be done." Dozens of households in the township hoard grain and sell it to private merchants. Ling Mingjin, a township committee member, hoarded fifteen shih of grain. When asked to sell it to the cooperative, he refused and ultimately sold it to a private merchant. There are also many people hiring farmhands in the township. Ling Mingyi, a member of the Communist Youth League and leader of a mutual aid team, also doesn't lead the mutual aid team well and often hires laborers to cultivate his land for him. Many peasants dream all day about how to get rich. If they are allowed to develop in this way, most peasants will sell their land and houses, families will be scattered, and they will live a life of suffering. A few people will become new landlords and rich peasants, relying solely on exploitation to make a living. From the perspective of developing production, the current rural land is scattered, tools are backward, and technology is low, making it difficult to overcome natural disasters. If this small-scale peasant economy is not united and does not engage in large-scale production, and if technology and agricultural tools are not improved, production cannot be further increased. This will not only prevent the peasants of the whole country from living a prosperous life but also fail to meet the needs of national construction and the people. After understanding these principles, I deeply realized that peasants must take the socialist road, and agriculture must undergo socialist transformation.
    Now I have understood the principles of the national General Line, but it is not enough for me to understand alone. I must return to my township and vigorously publicize and educate the peasants to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation, the socialist road. I must first set an example by selling my surplus grain to the state and mobilizing the mutual aid team members and all the peasants in the village to sell their surplus grain to the state to support the country's industrial construction. (Recorded by Cao Yanyi)
    The General Line Study Put Our Group on the Right Track
    Cao Zhensheng, Deputy Leader of the Mutual Aid Team of Wanglou Township, Wuyang County
    I think it is very necessary to criticize capitalist thinking. Many peasants now have this kind of thinking. Members of our mutual aid team also have this kind of thinking.
    I am the deputy leader of a mutual aid team in Wanglou Township, Wuyang County, Henan. Our team has twelve households, thirty-eight laborers, and cultivates two hundred and eight mu of land. Because we have a lot of labor and little land, our team attaches great importance to sideline production. In the past, because agricultural and sideline production were well-developed, our team was rated as a model mutual aid team by the county.
    In February of this year, Zhang Tongsheng, the deputy district head of our district, led us to invest our land as shares and combine our livestock. Later, we expanded the scope of operation of our oil mill. We found five oil traffickers who were in charge of selling oil and buying sesame seeds, and the team focused solely on processing. In terms of tax declaration, we told the tax bureau cadres, "Each time we press oil, we only produce 62 jin of oil and 72 jin of oil cake. According to the tax rate standard, we should pay a total of 43,000 yuan in income tax and business tax, which we guarantee to pay on a monthly basis." In reality, we produced 96 jin of oil each time. Some team members said, "Can we not pay enough taxes?" But other team members said, "We are a model team; it doesn't matter if we pay a little less." It wasn't until September of this year that the tax bureau comrades discovered that our team had evaded a total of 20.8 million yuan in taxes over twenty-seven months (2 million yuan has been paid in arrears).
    Tax evasion is the act of illegal capitalists undermining the state's tax revenue policies, and we unknowingly became infected with it. Our actions also influenced four other oil mills in the village to evade 50 million yuan in taxes, causing losses to the state's financial revenue. And the state's revenue is always used to benefit all the people of the country.
    On the other hand, the sesame seeds we used to press oil were purchased at high prices through peddlers: the price offered by the supply and marketing cooperative was 63,400 yuan per dou (40 jin), but we spent 70,000 to 80,000 yuan, undermining the state's price policy and making it impossible for the supply and marketing cooperative to buy sesame seeds. This not only made everyone suffer losses but also made us suffer losses ourselves.
    After the tax evasion was discovered, some team members said, "Good, this mess will cause the government to shut down our team." Team leader Cao Zhongxing felt that tax evasion was too embarrassing and cried for two days. I myself was also thinking: there is no future.
    After studying the General Line, I realized that the capitalist road is the wrong road. It is a painful road, and this road is impassable. The government's discovery of our team's tax evasion is by no means "shutting down our team," but rather putting our team on the right track. I think: our mutual aid team really shouldn't have committed such illegal acts, and I am truly sorry to the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. In the future, we must mobilize team members to study the General Line well, make team members realize the harm of capitalist thinking, raise socialist awareness, and strive to develop agricultural production in order to build the country and improve our lives.
    Where Did My Good Life Come From?
    Li Jintang, Deputy Director of the Li Bangsheng Agricultural Production Cooperative, Pingyu County
    I am the deputy director of the Li Bangsheng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Pingyu County, Henan Province. After the autumn harvest this year, I often pondered in my heart: grain prices will definitely rise next year, so I must find a way to store some grain. So I sold four mu of land that was too far across the river to manage for four million yuan. People gave me eight dou of sesame seeds, three shih of soybeans, and one shih of wheat, plus another 1.4 million yuan. They still owe me 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. I thought this was nothing to be afraid of. If I lend someone one dou of soybeans in the spring, will they not return one dou of wheat to me after the wheat harvest? As a result, I didn't want to lead the cooperative anymore, feeling that it wasn't as effective as working on my own. I also planned to buy grain with the more than 1.4 million yuan I had on hand and store it.
    After studying the national General Line during the transition period, I didn't sleep well for one night. I tossed and turned, thinking about what kind of life I lived before and where my good life now came from? I used to have little land and no house and worked as a tenant farmer for a landlord for eight years. After the land reform, I was allocated land, and I was elected as the town head. If it weren't for the good leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, how could I have turned over and lived such a good life! After this study, I realized that my past calculations were wrong. When I return, I am determined to lead the cooperative well, sell my surplus 1,200 jin of grain to the state, and deposit the money from the sale and the more than one million yuan I have on hand in the bank for the time being, to be used for expanded reproduction in the future. I will also patiently persuade the members and the masses to sell their surplus grain and industrial raw materials to the state. I want to lead the peasants to take the socialist road.

### 总路线照耀着农民走社会主义道路

    总路线照耀着农民走社会主义道路
    我明白了为什么农民必须接受社会主义的改造
    武昌县九尖乡乡长  何元亮
    我是一个共产党员，湖北省武昌县九尖乡乡长。我学习总路线学到要对农业逐步实行社会主义改造时，思想就不通了。我想：农民在旧社会仇大苦深，打蒋匪时，都积极参军、交粮，农民总是站在最前头，为么事现在又要改造？后来听了领导同志的报告，又经过反覆讨论，我把这些问题和我乡农民的实际情况联系起来，心里才亮堂了。先说我自己，我领导的互助组今年多打了七十多石谷子，我不但不让组员立刻卖给国家，要囤到春上卖高价，而且还欺骗银行，贷款一百万元，做了投机生意。我为么事要这样做？说句老实话，就是为了个人赚钱发财。我们乡里，一大组就有八户贫雇农卖田地，全乡有三十户暗放或明放高利贷。农民辛从斌因受天灾，生活困难，借了辛端生的二石谷，不到两年，就把一斗一升田抵给辛端生了。我乡贩卖粮食的事更普遍，干部就有十五个，群众就更用不着说了。副乡长郭德生，工作生产都不搞，专门贩黄豆、小麦、谷子。组长田土洪不搞互助组工作，做粮食生意，叫他开会搞生产，他说：“撤干部职都行，生意是要做的。”全乡囤粮卖给私商的有好几十户，乡委员凌明金囤了十五石谷子，叫他卖给合作社，他不同意，最后还是卖给了私商。乡里请长工的也不少，青年团员、互助组长凌明益也不好好领导互助组，常请工为他耕种。许多农民都整天做自己如何发财的梦。假使让他们这样发展下去，那大多数农民就会卖田卖房，妻离子散，过痛苦受难的日子，少数人又会变成新的地主和富农，专靠剥削为生。从发展生产上来看，现在的农村田地分散，工具落后，技术又低，也很难战胜自然灾害。这样的小农经济，如不联合起来，进行大规模生产，不改进技术和农具，生产就不能更提高，这不但不能使全国农民过富裕的生活，而且也不能满足国家建设和人民的需要。我懂得这些道理以后，才深深认识到农民非走社会主义道路不可，农业非实行社会主义改造不可了。
    我现在已经懂得了国家总路线的道理了，但是自己懂还不算，还要回乡好好宣传，教育农民走互助合作、社会主义的道路。我要首先作个榜样，把余粮卖给国家，并且要发动互助组员和全村农民，都把余粮卖给国家，支援国家的工业建设。    （曹炎义记）
    总路线学习把俺组引上了正路
    舞阳县王楼乡互助组副组长  曹振生
    我觉得批判资本主义思想是很必要的。现在不少农民有这种思想。俺们互助组的组员，也有这种思想。
    我是河南舞阳县王楼乡一个互助组的副组长。俺组十二户，三十八个劳动力，种二百零八亩地。因为劳力多，土地少，所以我组对副业生产很重视。过去由于农、副业生产搞得较好，我组被县里评为模范互助组。
    今年二月，俺区副区长张同生领导俺们把土地入了股，牲口合了槽。后来，俺们又扩大了油坊的经营范围。找了五个油贩，专管卖油、买芝麻，组里光搞加工。在报税方面，俺们给税局干部说：“我们每打一次油，只打六十二斤油，出油饼七十二斤，按税率标准，应纳所得税和营业税共四万三千元，保证按月交付。”实际上，每次打油九十六斤。有的组员说：“咱的税不缴够行吗？”可是别的组员说：“咱们是模范组，少缴点不要紧。”到今年九月，税局同志才查出俺组二十七个月共漏税两千零八十万元（已补缴二百万元）。
    偷税、漏税是不法资本家破坏国家税收政策的行为，俺们不知不觉地沾染上啦。俺们这样做，还影响了本村其他四个油坊漏税五千万元，使国家的财政收入受到了损失。而国家的收入从来都是用来为全国人民谋福利的。
    另一方面，俺们打油用的芝麻，是通过小贩用高价收购的：供销合作社收购的牌价是六万三千四百元一斗（四十斤），俺们掏了七万元到八万元，破坏了国家的价格政策，使供销合作社买不到芝麻。这样，不但使大家吃亏，自己也要吃亏。
    漏税被查出以后，有的组员说：“好啦，这一弄咱的组叫政府给搞垮台啦。”组长曹中兴觉着漏税太丢人，哭了两天。我自己也想着：往后没干头啦。
    学习了总路线以后，才知道资本主义道路是条错路。是痛苦的路，这条道路是走不通的。政府查出俺组漏税，决不是“把俺组给搞垮台”，而是把俺组引上了正路。我想：俺们互助组真不应该做出这样的犯法事，俺也真对不起共产党、毛主席。今后一定要动员组员好好学习总路线，使组员们认识到资本主义思想的害处，提高社会主义觉悟，为了建设国家，改善生活，努力发展农业生产。
    我现在的好日子从那里来的
    平舆县李邦生农业生产合作社副社长  李金堂
    我是河南省平舆县李邦生农业生产合作社的副社长。今年秋后，我心中时常盘算着：明年粮食一定涨价，得设法存点粮食。就把隔河太远不想经营的四亩地卖了四百万元，人家给的是八斗芝麻、三石豆子和一石麦子，另外还有一百四十万元，还欠我四、五十万元。我想这可不怕了。明年春天借给谁一斗豆子，麦后他还不还给一斗麦子？这一来，我就不想领导合作社了，觉着那没有单干得法。我手中的一百四十多万元，也准备买成粮食放着。
    经过国家过渡时期总路线的学习，我有一夜就没睡好，翻来覆去地想，以前过的是啥日子，现在的好日子从那里来的？我从前少地缺房，给地主当了八年佃户；土地改革后，分了地，我当选了镇长。要不是共产党和毛主席领导的好，我怎能这样翻身过好日子！在这次学习以后，我才知道我过去的那些打算是错误的。我回去，决心把社领导好，把我多余的一千二百斤粮食卖给国家，把卖的钱和手中暂时用不着的百余万元都储存到银行里，将来用在扩大再生产。我还要耐心说服社员和群众，把余粮和工业原料卖给国家；要领导农民走社会主义的道路。
