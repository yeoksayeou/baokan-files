    Fraternal Countries Support North Korea's Post-War Reconstruction
    Soviet Geologists in North Korea
    Excellent Soviet geological experts sent to North Korea are actively assisting North Korea in geological exploration of mines in various regions. They have made significant contributions to helping North Korea develop its underground resources. They have assisted many mines in determining mineral reserves. For example, the reserves of the Geomdeok and Seongcheon mines, whose mining output was already feeling inadequate four or five years ago, have now been accurately measured thanks to the vigorous assistance of Soviet geological experts, and long-term mining operations have begun. At the same time, Soviet geological experts are teaching advanced drilling methods in various mines using new Soviet electric drills and other machinery and equipment, increasing the drilling efficiency of North Korean geological explorers by more than double. Soviet geologists have also trained a large number of geological exploration workers for North Korea, and these new explorers have been successively dispatched to various regions to participate in geological exploration work.
    In the Gottwald Factory
    There is a huge underground factory in a certain place in North Korea, the Gottwald Factory. In the factory's spacious workshops, hundreds of electric lights emit dazzling light. Hundreds of lathes, perforating machines, and iron-shaping machines are neatly arranged here, and huge cranes are moving heavy blocks of iron... A moving slogan is posted on the factory wall: "Glory to Comrade Gottwald!" This is because the machines here were all sent by the people of Czechoslovakia.
    The deep friendship of the fraternal countries' people inspires the labor enthusiasm of the North Korean people. Workers are overfulfilling their daily work plans. The factory is buzzing with a surge of increased production.
    Two years ago, when these machines were transported here from Prague, only a few technicians who could operate these machines could be found among the workers. At that time, it was the first time they had seen special lathes that were more than ten meters wide, perforating machines that could perform fine work to one-thousandth of a millimeter, iron-shaping machines that were four meters high, and many other new types of machines. The factory's Party organization gathered advanced workers to organize a machine research association, and organized engineers who had just returned from studying in the Soviet Union to teach the workers the techniques of operating the machines; at the same time, it also established specialized schools and technical training institutes to actively cultivate technical talent. In this way, by the end of 1952, 1,200 technicians had been trained.
    In order to meet the needs of national restoration and construction, this factory decided that starting next year, it would formally produce "A26" type lathes; and before the end of this year, they will produce all the parts for this lathe. Currently, more than 200 of the more than 1,000 parts needed for this lathe have been produced.
    The Profound Feelings of Polish Peasants
    Shortly after the Korean armistice, in August of this year, Franciszek Ciorosz, a member of an agricultural production cooperative in Poland, donated 15,000 zlotys (Polish currency) of his savings to the North Korean people to help them rebuild their homes.
    In a letter to the peasant newspaper in Tarnów District, Poznań Province, Ciorosz said that he had saved this money to buy a car. However, when he heard the victorious news of the Korean armistice and was extremely happy, he could not help but think of the tragic situation in the early days after World War II, when Warsaw and the urban and rural areas of Poland were looted and destroyed by Hitler's bandits, and people suffering from hunger and cold were sitting on the ruins... At that time, the Soviet Union not only extended a helping hand to the Polish people, but also told them to always help those who needed help. Now the North Korean people are precisely the people who need help.
    Ciorosz concluded his letter by writing: "I donate the money with great joy to help an orphan receive an education, or to help a widow. Although we are very far apart, the obligation to help each other connects us. We can achieve victory in this way."
    New Work for Hungarian Engineers
    During the North Korean people's war against aggression, the Hungarian people gave the North Korean people a lot of assistance, adopted North Korean war orphans, donated various materials, and sent medical teams. After the Korean armistice, the Hungarian people began to assist the North Korean people in their restoration and reconstruction. Since August, the staff of the Budapest Design Bureau have started a new job: drawing technical drawings of various buildings for the North Korean people. Some engineers have designed a standard drawing for a cultural palace, and others are designing standard drawings for rural clinics, worker and student dormitories, educational institutions, and kindergartens. They are determined to help the North Korean people rebuild a new life on the ruins.
    Mongolian Workers Increase Production to Aid Korea
    When the North Korean people were in the difficult stage of the war in 1951, the people of the Mongolian People's Republic gave the North Korean people 7,000 horses and a large number of leather and cotton clothes. In 1952, they continued to donate 70,000 head of livestock, as well as meat, clothing, and other items. In January of this year, they donated another 1,000 tons of grain, 700 tons of meat, as well as fur and various clothing items.
    In February of this year, at the suggestion of Ba Zhika, a worker at the Nalai Coal Mine, the Mongolian people launched a movement to donate to the Aid Korea Fund. Workers donated their wages one after another, and farmers donated the livestock they raised. Tsusandarjaa, a worker on the Darhan Railway, decided to donate 350 teregs (Mongolian currency) within one year, and his wife, Bumeilu, also decided to donate six days' wages every month. In addition to donating 300 teregs in cash, the farmer Suren also donated 30 horses, 4 cows, and 180 sheep. When he donated his six favorite horses, he said: "I will do everything in my power to support the North Korean brothers. The horses I personally raised will faithfully serve the heroes on the front and rear of North Korea, which I am proud of."
    After the Korean armistice, the Mongolian people immediately launched a upsurge in support of North Korean construction. At the employees' congress of the Ulaanbaatar Second Woodworking Combination, the worker Zhezhi decided to guarantee the overfulfillment of 150 percent of the daily production plan to support North Korea's construction; the employees of the Central Ewe's Milk Company also held a meeting and decided to complete the production of ewe's milk and raw wool ahead of schedule and above the plan, adding to the restoration and construction of the post-war North Korean economy.

    兄弟国家支援朝鲜恢复建设
    苏联地质学家在朝鲜
    苏联派到朝鲜的优秀的地质专家们，正在积极协助朝鲜进行各地矿山地质的勘探工作。他们在帮助朝鲜开发地下资源的工作中，作出了巨大的贡献。他们帮助不少矿山测定了矿藏的储藏量，例如：在四、五年前采矿量就已感不足的检德和成川两个矿山，由于苏联地质专家们大力帮助勘探的结果，现在都已正确地测定了矿藏的储藏量，并已开始了长期性的采矿工作。同时，苏联地质专家们以苏联给朝鲜的新式电钻和其他机器、设备，在各矿山教授先进的钻探方法，使朝鲜的地质勘探工作者的钻探作业效率比过去提高了一倍以上。苏联地质学家们并为朝鲜培养了大批的地质勘探工作者，这些新的勘探工作者已被先后派往各地去参加地质勘探工作。
    在哥特瓦尔德工厂里
    在朝鲜某地有一个巨大的地下工厂，就是哥特瓦尔德工厂。在这个工厂的宽敞的工作车间里，几百盏电灯放射出耀眼的光芒。这里整齐地排列着几百架车床穿孔机和削铁机，巨大的起重机挟着沉重的铁块在转动着……工厂的墙壁上贴着一幅动人的标语：“光荣属于哥特瓦尔德同志！”这是因为这里的机器都是捷克斯洛伐克人民送来的。
    兄弟国家人民的深厚友谊，鼓舞着朝鲜人民的劳动热情。工人们超额完成每天的工作计划。工厂里到处沸腾着增产的热潮。
    两年前，当这些机器从布拉格运到这里的时候，工人们中间还找不到几个能够操作这些机器的技术人员。当时他们还是第一次看到十几公尺宽的特殊车床、能做千分之一公厘的精细工作的穿孔机、四公尺高的削铁机等许多新式机器。工厂里的党组织就集合先进工人组织机器研究会，并且组织刚从苏联学习回来的工程师把操作机器的技术教给工人们；同时又开办了专门学校和技术养成所，积极培养技术人材。这样，到一九五二年底，已经培养出一千二百名技术人员了。
    为了配合国家恢复和建设的需要，这个工厂决定从明年起，就正式生产“A二六”型车床；而且今年年底以前，他们将制出这个车床的各种零件。现在，这个车床所需要的一千多种零件，已有二百多种生产出来了。
    波兰农民的深情厚意
    朝鲜停战后不久，今年八月间，波兰的一位农业生产合作社社员弗朗齐歇克·齐奥罗什，把他一万五千兹罗提（波币）的储金捐给朝鲜人民，帮助他们重建家园。
    齐奥罗什在写给波兹南区塔尔诺地方农民报的信中说：他储蓄这笔钱，原是为了购买一辆汽车。但是，当他听到朝鲜停战的胜利消息而万分高兴的时候，他不禁想起了第二次世界大战后的初期，华沙和波兰城乡遭受希特勒匪徒劫掠和破坏的悲惨情形，饥寒交迫的人们坐在废墟上……当时，苏联不仅向波兰人民伸出援助之手，而且还告诉他们要经常帮助那些需要帮助的人。现在朝鲜人民也正是需要帮助的人。
    齐奥罗什最后在他的信中这样写道：“我怀着万分高兴的心情把钱捐出来，用这些钱帮助一个孤儿受到教育，或是帮助一位寡妇，虽然我们相隔非常遥远，但是互助的义务把我们连接起来了。我们能用这种方法取得胜利。”
    匈牙利工程师们的新工作
    在朝鲜人民反侵略战争期间，匈牙利人民曾给朝鲜人民许多援助，收养朝鲜战争孤儿，捐助各种物资，派遣医疗队。朝鲜停战后，匈牙利人民就着手援助朝鲜人民的恢复和建设。从八月份起，布达佩斯设计局的工作人员们开始进行一种新的工作：为朝鲜人民绘制各种建筑物的技术图样。一些工程师们已设计了一座文化宫的标准图样，另一些工程师们也正设计着乡村诊所、工人和学生宿舍、教育机关、幼儿园的标准图样。他们决心帮助朝鲜人民在废墟上重新建设新生活。
    蒙古工人们增产援朝
    当一九五一年朝鲜人民处在战争的艰难阶段的时候，蒙古人民共和国人民曾赠给朝鲜人民七千匹马和大批的皮衣、棉衣。一九五二年继续赠送了七万头牲畜以及肉类、衣皮等其他物品。今年一月间又赠送了一千吨粮食、七百吨肉类，还有毛皮和各种衣物。
    今年二月间，在拿拉伊煤矿工人巴志卡的建议下，蒙古人民又曾展开了一个捐献援朝基金运动。工人们纷纷捐献自己的工资，农民们纷纷捐献自己饲养的牲畜。达尔汉铁路工人突山达尔扎决心在一年内捐献三百五十泰雷克（蒙币），他的妻子布美卢也决心每月捐献六天的工资。农民苏门除了捐献三百泰雷克现款之外，还捐献了三十匹马，四头牛和一百八十只羊。当他捐献他最喜爱的六匹马的时候，他说：“我将尽我一切的力量支援朝鲜弟兄们。我亲自饲养的马将为朝鲜前后方的英雄们忠实服务，这点是我引为自豪的。”
    朝鲜停战以后，蒙古人民又立刻掀起了支援朝鲜建设的热潮。在乌兰巴托第二木工组合员工大会上，工人泽智夫表示决心，保证超额完成每天生产计划的百分之一百五十，来支援朝鲜的建设；中央羊乳公司的员工们也举行了集会，决心提前超额完成羊乳生产和生毛计划，给战后朝鲜人民经济的恢复建设增添一份力量。
