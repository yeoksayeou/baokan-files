Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 13th. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission notified the Korean-Chinese side this afternoon that the explanatory work of the Korean-Chinese side still cannot be resumed due to the opposition to segregation by the U.S. special agents in the camp. This morning, the Korean-Chinese side had put forward a plan to explain to 250 Korean People's Army prisoners of war tomorrow.

After the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission arranged segregation facilities in Dongjang-ri on December 10th, the Korean-Chinese side has submitted plans daily since December 11th, requesting the continuation of explanations to the Korean People's Army prisoners of war in Camp No. 53. The Korean-Chinese side conducted explanations to a portion of the prisoners of war in Camp No. 53 on November 16th.

Although the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has arranged segregation facilities at the repeated requests of the Korean-Chinese side, the explanatory work of the Korean-Chinese side still cannot be resumed due to the continued refusal of segregation and supervision by the U.S. special agents in the camp for the past two days.

In contrast, the Korean-Chinese side had already arranged segregation facilities in Songgok-ri, allowing the explanatory work of the U.S. side, which began on December 2nd, to proceed smoothly every day according to the explanation plan. The completely opposite situations of the explanatory work in Songgok-ri and Dongjang-ri show the extremely unfair and unequal phenomenon in the explanatory work of both sides. Our side's General Li Sang-cho has repeatedly requested the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to take resolute measures to implement the regulations on segregating prisoners of war, so as to ensure that the explanatory work of both sides is carried out on a fair and equal basis.

### 我方解释工作因特务反对隔离还没有恢复

    我方解释工作因特务反对隔离还没有恢复
    【新华社开城十三日电】中立国遣返委员会在今天下午通知朝中方面说，由于营场中的美方特务反对隔离，朝中方面的解释工作仍然不能恢复。在今天早晨，朝中方面曾提出了明天向二百五十名朝鲜人民军被俘人员进行解释的计划。
    中立国遣返委员会在十二月十日在东场里安排好了隔离设备以后，朝中方面就从十一日起逐日提出计划要求继续对第五十三号营场的朝鲜人民军被俘人员进行解释。朝中方面在十一月十六日曾对第五十三号营场的一部分战俘进行了解释。
    虽然，中立国遣返委员会在朝中方面的多次要求下已安排好隔离设备，但是两天来由于营场中的美方特务继续拒绝隔离看管，朝中方面的解释工作仍然无法恢复。
    与此相反，朝中方面早已在松谷里安排好隔离设备，使得美方从十二月二日开始的解释工作，每天都能按照解释计划顺利地进行。松谷里和东场里解释工作的截然相反的情形，显示了双方解释工作中极不公平、极不对等的现象。我方李相朝将军已一再要求中立国遣返委员会采取坚决措施实施隔离战俘的规定，以保证双方解释工作在公平对等的基础上进行。
