The Affiliated Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary School of Renmin University of China was founded in early April 1950 (originally named Beijing Experimental Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary School). Its purpose is to train industrial workers and worker-peasant cadres, raising their educational level to the secondary school level within three years so that they can enter universities for further study. The admission requirements are: worker-peasant cadres who have participated in the revolution for more than three years or workers who have engaged in labor for more than three years, possessing an educational level equivalent to that of a higher primary school graduate, aged between eighteen and thirty, ideologically progressive, and in good health.

When the school was first established on a trial basis, it only enrolled 116 students. Now, it has expanded to 907 students (industrial workers account for 10.58 percent, worker-peasant cadres account for 86.92 percent, and others account for 2.5 percent). Many students have been commended and awarded for their work; some have been awarded the titles of work model, labor model, and combat hero. For example, Hao Jianxiu, a second-year student, and Hang Peilan, a first-year student, are both famous labor models; Zhou Tiancai, a second-year student, was awarded the title of "Artillery Searching Hero" in the People's Liberation War.

In the past three years, under the leadership of the Party and the government, the accelerated teaching has been basically successful. In the summer of 1953, the first class of students graduated. They completed the nine courses (including twenty-four subjects) of ordinary middle schools with 3,566 class hours and basically met the requirements of the teaching plan. As for the Chinese language course, when students first entered the school, they could only write articles of about 300 words and read simple narrative essays. After three years of study, they learned about 100 model essays and read works such as "Xiao Erhei's Marriage," "Li Youcai's Rhymes," "The Hurricane," "New Heroes and Heroines," "How Steel Was Tempered," "The Story of Zoya and Shura," and "Days and Nights." As a result, their writing ability has greatly improved. Students can not only write narrative essays and argumentative essays, but also use more complex language to write literary sketches; in general, the content of their compositions is rich and their emotions are healthy. In mathematics, history, geography, and other subjects, they have acquired systematic basic knowledge. Sun Defu, who has now been admitted to the preparatory class for studying in the Soviet Union, was originally a child from a poor peasant family and had only attended school for three years before entering the school. The first time he wrote an essay, he spent four hours writing a short article, in which there were twenty-four typos in nearly two hundred words; when he graduated, his grades in all subjects were four and five points. In his last assignment, he summarized his learning achievements in the past three years in a logical, focused, and well-organized manner. He was elected as the secretary of the Party branch, leading the branch to promote and ensure the learning of the entire class. Ren Yuansheng was also a child from a poor peasant family who herded cattle for landlords since he was a child and had never attended school for a day. After joining the revolution, he had undergone cultural learning in his work and had an educational level equivalent to that of a primary school graduate. After three years of study after entering the school, his educational level improved rapidly, and he was rated as an excellent student upon graduation. He wrote a reflection on his reading, analyzing the constantly growing communist moral character of the people under the superior social system of the Soviet Union, which was praised by teachers and students. Now, he has been admitted to the Department of Law of Renmin University of China. When mentioning the learning achievements of the past three years, the students' faces are filled with joy of victory. They are proud of the victory of their studies, but they are not arrogant or complacent because of it.

Fifty-nine of the first graduating students have been admitted to the Departments of Industrial Economics, Economic Planning, Cooperation, Domestic Trade, Foreign Trade, Law, and Russian Language of Renmin University of China; five have been admitted to the preparatory class for studying in the Soviet Union; and twenty-one have been admitted to Peking University, Beijing Institute of Technology, and other universities. In a few years, they will become high-level construction talents for the new China.

In their studies, the students overcame difficulties with perseverance. Ren Yuansheng wrote in his article "Ideal Has Become Reality":
"In the past, we never bowed our heads to the enemy, and today we will not bow our heads to difficulties. We have the confidence to achieve great victories on the learning front." Some students said: "We must never be 'prisoners' of books, and we must take down the fortresses on the road ahead one by one!" When mathematics came to plane geometry, the students generally felt that it was difficult. They gathered together in their spare time, taking models made of ropes and wooden boards to experiment and study. In order to understand more than twenty geometric formulas, Lan Mingxu used his spare time after the teacher's explanation to draw the theorems on the book one by one, then cut them apart, and compare them bit by bit, thinking: Why do two parallel lines not intersect, and why is this called supplementary angles...? Some students often felt rushed at the beginning of their studies, thinking about history during Chinese class, and thinking about arithmetic during history class, just as a student said, "Thinking about this, doing that, a self-study class is over." The Academic Affairs Office, based on this situation, required them to make self-study plans according to the schedule, and review the daily lessons and complete the assignments designated by the teacher according to the pre-arranged plan. They concentrated on listening to the teacher's lectures in class; after class, everyone reviewed well, thought more, and did more exercises, instead of rote memorization. For example, when learning world geography, it was difficult for the students to remember the names of mountains, rivers, and cities, so they looked at the pictures more and thought with their brains.

The teachers taught enthusiastically and patiently according to the characteristics of the students. Generally, students have been tempered for a considerable period of time, have a high degree of class consciousness, and have relatively rich experience in struggle and production practice, so their comprehension ability is strong when accepting scientific knowledge. This is an advantage for their learning. However, because they lacked formal cultural learning in production, combat, and work in the past, the knowledge they acquired was often fragmented, piecemeal, and incomplete. For example, in Chinese, they have a strong ability to understand and analyze, but their expression ability is poor, because they lack basic training in characters, words, and sentences. In arithmetic, some of them can do mental arithmetic and say the answer, but they often cannot master the basic arithmetic methods. In history and geography, they are very familiar with the events and places they have personally experienced, but they are unfamiliar with the entire history and geography. As for common sense of natural science, they lack it even more. The teachers fully recognized the above advantages and disadvantages of the students, paid attention to giving play to the students' enthusiasm in teaching, so that they often maintained a full spirit and loved every subject; paid attention to praising the students' achievements and encouraged them to continue to move forward. And around classroom teaching, held reading report meetings, speech meetings, literary learning evenings, or organized students to visit, watch movies and dramas, to expand and deepen the effect of classroom teaching and improve students' interest in learning. Not only that, the teachers also paid attention to systematically imparting knowledge, gradually raising the students' daily life knowledge, struggle practice, and production practice to the level of scientific knowledge. In the teaching process, attention was paid to mastering the principle of gradual progress and gradual improvement. For example, taking geography class as an example, students were first asked to learn physical geography well, and then, on this basis, to learn Chinese geography and world geography well, and then to learn Chinese and foreign economic geography. Mathematics first learns arithmetic and algebra well, and then learns geometry and trigonometry. Chinese and mathematics are the basis for learning other subjects, and teachers pay special attention to basic training. The teachers fully applied the principle of intuitive teaching in teaching, which is of great help to industrial workers and worker-peasant cadres in learning culture. In geometry and trigonometry teaching, mathematics teachers used thick paper, thin boards, etc. to make many physical teaching aids to help students understand and remember the proof and application of theorems, and to more clearly understand the concepts of mathematical terms. When the first batch of students first learned natural geography and some parts of Chinese geography, they also encountered difficulties, so the teachers used physical teaching aids in teaching, such as globes, hemisphere maps, three-sphere instruments, etc., and made contour line three-dimensional models, wooden levels, and other models to help students firmly grasp the basic knowledge of geography.

In teaching, the leading role of teachers is emphasized. The school requires teachers to be fully responsible for the students and to care for and pay attention to the students' progress in politics, culture, and health; and to achieve this goal through the entire teaching process, through the ideological and scientific nature of the teaching content, and through the improvement of teaching methods.

In order to improve the political and professional level of the school's administrative leadership and teachers, administrative responsible comrades and all teachers participated in the Marxist-Leninist night school held by the school Party committee to study the "History of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Soviet Union" and the History of the Chinese Revolution; in the future, they also plan to study political economy and philosophy. In terms of professional learning, the main focus is on studying Kairov's pedagogy, learning and applying the Soviet Union's advanced classroom teaching principles, methods, and systems, which has improved the quality of teaching.

Although the Affiliated Worker-Peasant Accelerated Secondary School of Renmin University of China has achieved many results in teaching in the past three years, there are still many shortcomings that need to be further improved to meet the new tasks of building the motherland.

    三年来的中国人民大学附设工农速成中学
    胡朝芝
    中国人民大学附设工农速成中学是在一九五○年四月初创办的（原名是北京实验工农速成中学）。它的目的在于培养产业工人、工农干部，在三年之内把他们的文化水平提高到中学程度，以便使他们能升入大学继续深造。招生的条件是：参加革命三年以上的工农干部或参加劳动三年以上的工人，具有相当于高小毕业的文化水平，年龄十八岁到三十岁，思想进步，身体健康。
    学校试办时只招收学生一百一十六人，现已扩大到九百零七人（产业工人占百分之十点五八，工农干部占百分之八十六点九二，其他占百分之二点五）。许多同学曾在工作中立过功受过奖；有的曾荣获工作模范、劳动模范和战斗英雄的称号。如二年级学生郝建秀和一年级学生杭佩兰，都是著名的劳动模范；二年级学生周天才，在人民解放战争中曾荣获“搜炮英雄”的称号。
    三年来，学校在党和政府的领导下，速成教学基本上是成功的。一九五三年夏天，第一届同学毕业，他们以三千五百六十六课时，学完了普通中学的九门课程（包括二十四门学科），并基本上达到了教学计划的要求。就语文课来说，学生初入学时，只能写三百字左右的文章，阅读浅显的记叙文。经过三年的学习，他们学了一百篇左右的范文，阅读了“小二黑结婚”、“李有才板话”、“暴风骤雨”、“新儿女英雄传”、“钢铁是怎样炼成的”、“卓娅和舒拉的故事”、“日日夜夜”等作品。写作能力因而大大提高，同学们不仅能写记叙文、论说文，并能运用较复杂的语言写作文艺小品；作文的内容，一般说来是丰富的，情感是健康的。在数学、史地等学科方面，都获得了系统的基本知识。现已考入留苏预备班学习的孙德福，他原来是贫农家的孩子，入学前只上过三年学。第一次作文时，他用了四个钟头写了一篇短文章，在将近二百字中就有二十四个错别字；毕业时，他的各科成绩都是四分、五分。在最后一篇习作中，他有条理、有中心、有层次地总结了三年来的学习成绩。他被选为党支部书记，领导支部推动和保证了全班的学习。任元生过去也是贫农家的孩子，从小给地主放牛，没有上过一天学。参加革命后，他曾在工作中进行了文化学习，具有相当于小学毕业的水平。入学后经过三年的学习，他的文化水平提高得很快，毕业时被评为优等生。他写了一篇读书心得，分析了在苏联优越的社会制度下，人民的不断成长的共产主义道德品质，受到了师生的赞扬。现在，他已考入中国人民大学法律系学习。一提起三年来的学习成绩，同学们的脸上就充满了胜利的喜悦，他们为着学习的胜利而自豪，但却并不因此而骄傲自满。
    第一届毕业学生中已有五十九人升入中国人民大学工业经济系、经济计划系、合作系、对内贸易系、对外贸易系、法律系、俄文系；考入留苏预备班的有五人；升入北京大学、北京工业学院以及其他高等学校的有二十一人。几年以后，他们将成为新中国的高级建设人材。
    同学们在学习中以坚韧不拔的精神，战胜了困难。任元生在他“理想已成现实”一文中写道：
  “过去，我们没有向敌人低过头，今天也不会向困难低头，有信心在学习战线上取得重大的胜利。”有的同学说：“我们决不能作书本的‘俘虏’，要把前进途中的堡垒一个一个拿下来！”数学讲到平面几何时，同学们普遍感到有困难，他们便在课余时间聚拢在一起，拿着自己用绳子、木板作的模型试验着、研究着。兰明绪为了弄通二十几个几何公式，在教师讲解后，他利用课余时间把书上的定理一个一个地画下来，再剪开，一点一点地对证，琢磨着：为什么两平行线不相交，为什么这样就叫互为补角……。有些同学在开始学习时，往往感到忙乱，上语文课时想着历史，上历史课时又想到算术，正如
  一个同学说的，“想想这，搞搞那，一堂自习课就过去了”。教导处就根据这种情况，要求他们依照课程表作出自习计划，按照预订计划来复习每天的功课，完成教师指定的作业。他们在课堂上聚精会神地听先生讲课；下课后，大家都好好进行复习，多用思考，多作练习，不去死记、硬记。譬如学世界地理要记山脉、河流、城市的名称，同学们觉得很困难，他们就多看图多用脑子想。
    教师们根据同学的特点，热情地耐心地进行教学。一般同学都经过相当时期的锻炼，具有较高的阶级觉悟和比较丰富的斗争和生产实践的经验，因此在接受科学知识上理解力是强的。这是他们学习的有利条件。但是由于他们过去在生产中、战斗中、工作中缺乏正规的文化学习，他们所获得的知识往往是片断的、零星的、不完整的。譬如语文，他们有较强的理解分析能力，但表达能力就较差，因为他们对字、词、句缺乏基本训练。在算术方面，他们有的能心算，能说出得数，但往往不能掌握基本的运算方法。史地课，他们对亲自经历的事件、地方是很熟悉的，但对整个的历史、地理则是生疏的。至于自然科学常识他们更是缺乏。教师们全面地认识了同学的上述优缺点，在教学中注意发挥学生的积极性，使他们经常保持饱满的精神，热爱每一学科；注意表扬学生的成就，鼓舞他们继续不断地前进。并围绕着课堂教学，举行读书报告会、演讲会、文艺学习晚会，或组织同学参观、看电影和戏剧，以扩展和加深课堂教学的效果，提高学生的学习兴趣。不仅如此，教师还注意系统地传授知识，把学生的日常生活知识、斗争实践、生产实践逐步提高到科学知识水平上来。在教学过程中，注意掌握循序渐进、逐步提高的原则。譬如拿地理课来说，先让同学把自然地理学好，然后再在这一基础上学好本国地理、世界地理，再学中外经济地理。数学先学好算术、代数，然后再学几何、三角。语文、数学两科是学好其他学科的基础，教师特别注意基本的训练。教师在教学上充分运用了直观教学的原则，这对于产业工人、工农干部学文化是大有帮助的。数学教师在几何、三角教学中利用厚纸、薄板等制作许多实物教具，帮助同学理解、记忆定理的证法和应用，比较明确地认识数学名词的概念。在第一批学生初学自然地理和中国地理的某些部分时，也遇到了困难，教师便在教学中采用实物教具，如地球仪、半球图、三球仪等，并制作了等高线立体模型、木制水准器以及其他的模型，帮助学生牢固地掌握了地理的基本知识。
    在教学中，强调教师的主导作用，学校方面要求教师全面地对学生负责，关心和注意学生在政治、文化、健康等方面的进步；并通过整个的教学过程，通过教学内容的思想性、科学性以及教学方法的改进，来达到这个目的。
    为了提高学校行政领导骨干和教师的政治、业务水平，行政负责同志和全体教师都参加了校党委举办的马克思列宁主义夜校，学习“联共（布）党史”、中国革命史；今后还准备学习政治经济学和哲学。在业务学习方面，主要是学习凯洛夫的教育学，学习和运用苏联先进的课堂教学原则、方法和制度，这样就使教学质量有了提高。
    中国人民大学附设工农速成中学三年来在教学中虽已获得了不少的成绩，但还存在着许多的缺点，有待于进一步改进，迎接建设祖国的新任务。
