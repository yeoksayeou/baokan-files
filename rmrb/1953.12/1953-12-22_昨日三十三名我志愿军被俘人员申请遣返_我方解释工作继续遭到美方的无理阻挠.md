Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 21st: Today is the eighth day in the sixty-eighth day since the beginning of the explanatory work by the Korean and Chinese sides, during which prisoners of war were actually explained to. Among the 249 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war who listened to the explanation at the No. 3 camp today, 33 boldly expressed their application for repatriation. This once again bankrupted the U.S. side's lie that prisoners of war "would rather die than be repatriated," and the U.S. "psychological warfare" of forcibly detaining prisoners of war suffered another heavy defeat.

At the same time, the U.S. "psychological warfare" experts continued to refuse to give full explanations to South Korean, American, and British prisoners of war, causing the prisoners of war in Songgok-ri to wait another day. In the nine days of explanation, the U.S. side explained to 224 prisoners of war, but not a single one applied for repatriation.

Today, the explanation work in the East Camp began at 8:30 a.m. At 9:05 a.m., the first prisoner of war who requested repatriation walked out of the tent toward the tent waiting for repatriation.

In the No. 3 explanation tent, after listening to the words of the explanation representative, a prisoner of war named Ren Mingxin said to the Indian chairman of the Subsidiary Body: "I have something to say." Then, this prisoner of war bitterly accused the U.S. side of all kinds of cruel persecution suffered by the prisoners of war. He said: "Who is preventing us from being repatriated? During the American 'screening' last year, I personally saw some prisoners of war who were willing to be repatriated beaten by the Americans until they were covered in blood. The special agents also forbade me from bringing luggage, threatening us, saying: 'Anyone who dares to return to the mainland will be in trouble!' I personally saw eight prisoners of war beaten to death by the Americans and thrown away in sacks..." When this prisoner of war spoke, our explanation representative and neutral nations personnel watched this person, who had experienced two or three years of inhuman torture, with deep sympathy. However, the faces of the U.S. "observer representative" and "detaining party representative" sitting on the side turned red and then white, appearing extremely uneasy. These people were also very afraid in Songgok-ri when their former soldiers talked about their past life in South Korea, and they even resorted to forcing the chairman of the Subsidiary Body to lift the prisoners of war away by force to prevent them from speaking.

Another prisoner of war said in the No. 12 tent: "In the American prisoner of war camp, I could only eat half a small bowl of rice per meal and was hungry all day long. After the special agents discovered people who were willing to be repatriated, they forced them to eat feces or buried their lower bodies in yellow soil as punishment." After this prisoner of war finished speaking, he walked towards the door applying for repatriation.

Another prisoner of war, who was said by the U.S. side to "rather die than be repatriated," angrily tore off the insignia of the Kuomintang bandit gang as soon as he entered the explanation site. Shortly after entering the tent, he requested repatriation.

In the No. 6 tent, a pale-faced prisoner of war muttered after entering the tent: "Return to Taiwan!" "Return to Taiwan!" The explanation representative knew that he was saying this under the terroristic influence of the special agents, so he patiently explained to him with great sympathy, telling him that the special agents could no longer persecute him. The more this prisoner of war listened, the lower his head went, and finally he raised his head and said: "I want to go back, I want to go back to my country!" He threw the Kuomintang bandit gang's hat badge and chest badge on the ground, not looking at the U.S. "representative," and hurriedly walked towards the door applying for repatriation.

Today, the prisoners of war who applied for repatriation were still very afraid of the special agents after applying for repatriation. Almost all the prisoners of war asked when they walked out of the explanation tent: "Is it safe to go out?" While asking, they ran towards the road to the tent waiting for repatriation, afraid that special agents would come after them.

As before, our side's explanation work was still obstructed by the U.S. side.

At the B-1 explanation site, many prisoners of war were forced to smear pot ashes on their faces and wear white hats made of paper that were more than two feet high before entering the explanation tent. The Indian troops wiped off their pot ashes and then brought them into the explanation tent to listen to the explanation.

The Chiang bandit special agents mixed in with the prisoners of war used methods such as slamming the table, stomping their feet, and hysterical yelling to disrupt the process. In the No. 7 tent, a special agent openly said: "I am a special agent!" In the No. 27 tent, a special agent shouted: "People who want to return to the country should be killed, and there are too few killings!" In the No. 28 tent, two special agents posing as prisoners of war were arrested on the spot for disobeying the chairman of the Subsidiary Body and violating the rules.

In the No. 27 tent, there was a special agent posing as a prisoner of war with a face full of horizontal scars. When the explanation representative pointed out the fact that Zhang Zilong was murdered by special agents, he shouted loudly: "We just want to kill him! We want to kill all the people who want to return to the country, not only kill him, but also dig out his heart, peel his skin, and pull out his tendons!" At that time, the U.S. "translator" personnel did not translate the special agent's confession. After our side's translation personnel translated it truthfully for the neutral nations personnel of the Subsidiary Body present, they were greatly shocked. In addition, there were also twenty or thirty "prisoners of war" pretending to listen to the explanation, and then using the "questions to question the communist explanation representative" issued by the U.S. special agency CIE to disrupt the process and delay time.

The U.S. "observer representatives," "detaining party representatives," and "translators" also continued to openly intimidate the prisoners of war with various means to prevent the prisoners of war from being repatriated. In the No. 18 tent, the U.S. "detaining party representative" often gestured to the prisoners of war, asking the prisoners of war to go to the door that had not yet applied for repatriation. After our side's observer representative protested to the Indian chairman of the Subsidiary Body, the Indian chairman said to the U.S. "representative": "Not only did the Korean and Chinese observer representatives see your actions, but we also saw them. I warn you not to do this again." However, when our side's explanation representative told the prisoners of war that the neutral nations would be responsible for repatriation after applying for repatriation, this U.S. "representative" violated the "working rules" and interjected: "Where are the neutral nations here? There is only the Subsidiary Body here." The Indian chairman immediately ordered him to shut up and told him: "This is an insult to the neutral nations." In the No. 18 tent, the U.S. "observer representative," when exiting the tent to let the prisoners of war consider repatriation, deliberately walked at the end, secretly waving his right hand vigorously next to his buttocks towards the "not yet applied for repatriation" door, threatening the prisoners of war to go out from that door. In the No. 30 tent, when our side's explanation representative accused the U.S. "translator" of errors in translation, the U.S. "translator" cursed: "You fart!" In the No. 10 tent, a tall, bespectacled U.S. "translator" pointed sternly at the door that had not yet applied for repatriation and said to the prisoners of war: "This is the door to Taiwan!" This person, surnamed Li, was a Taiwanese Kuomintang special agent who had ordered the prisoners of war to tear up their name cards so that the Indian troops could not identify the special agents planted in the prisoners of war.

Today, four American jet planes circled near the explanation site, making threatening noises, attempting to increase the suspicion and fear of the prisoners of war listening to the explanation.

Today, the U.S. news reporters showed a similar disappointed expression to the previous days in Songgok-ri. After they saw more than a dozen prisoners of war, whom they called "would rather die than be repatriated," apply for repatriation in the morning, they rarely appeared in the afternoon.

Today, the situation of the explanation work in the East Camp powerfully proves that the reason why the U.S. side insists on its unreasonable demands and wants to end the explanation work on December 23 is to deprive the prisoners of war of the opportunity to listen to the explanation and apply for repatriation, so that its "psychological warfare" can avoid suffering a more shameful defeat.

### 昨日三十三名我志愿军被俘人员申请遣返  我方解释工作继续遭到美方的无理阻挠

    昨日三十三名我志愿军被俘人员申请遣返
    我方解释工作继续遭到美方的无理阻挠
      【新华社开城二十一日电】今天是朝中方面解释工作开始以来六十八天中实际对战俘进行解释的第八天。在今天听解释的第三号营场的二百四十九名中国人民志愿军被俘人员中，有三十三个人大胆表示申请遣返。这使美方所谓战俘“宁死不愿遣返”的谎言遭到了又一次破产，强迫扣留战俘的美国“心理战”遭到了又一次惨重的失败。
    同时，美国“心理战”专家们今天还是继续拒绝对南朝鲜、美国和英国战俘作充分解释，使松谷里的战俘又等待了一天。美方在九天的解释中对二百二十四名战俘进行了解释，但没有一个人申请遣返。
    今天东场里的解释工作在八点三十分开始。九点零五分，第一个要求遣返的战俘就走出帐篷向等待遣返的帐篷走去。
    在第三号解释帐篷，一个名叫任明新的战俘在听了解释代表的话以后，向附属机构印度主席说：“我有话要说。”接着，这个战俘悲愤地控诉了战俘们所遭受的美方的种种残酷迫害。他说：“是谁不让我们遣返呢？在去年美国人‘甄别’时，我亲眼看见有些愿意遣返的战俘被美国人打得血肉模糊。特务们还不准我带行李，恫吓我们说：‘谁敢回大陆，对他不起！’我亲眼看见有八个战俘被美国人活活打死，被装在麻袋里扔掉了。……”在这个战俘讲话时，我方解释代表和中立国人员都以深切的同情注视着这个经历了两三年非人折磨的人。可是，坐在一边的美方“观察代表”和“拘留一方代表”的脸却一会儿发红，一会儿发白，显得异常不安。这些人在松谷里的时候，也是非常害怕他们从前的士兵谈到过去在南朝鲜的生活的，他们甚至不惜迫使附属机构主席用武力把战俘抬走，不让他们说话。
    另一个战俘在第十二号帐篷里说：“在美国战俘营里我每顿只能吃半小碗饭，整天挨饿。特务分子发现愿意遣返的人以后，就逼着他们吃粪便，或者用黄土埋住他们的下半截身子当作刑罚。”这个战俘说完后就向申请遣返的门走去。
    另外一个被美方说成是“宁死不愿遣返”的战俘，刚一进入解释场所就愤愤地把身上的国民党匪帮的徽号撕下来。进入帐篷后不久，他就要求遣返。
    在第六号帐篷，一个面色苍白的战俘进帐篷后喃喃地说：“回台湾！”“回台湾！”解释代表知道他是在特务的恐怖影响下才这样说的，便以十分同情的心情，耐心地对他进行解释，告诉他特务分子已经不能再迫害他了。这个战俘越听头越低下去，最后抬起头来说：“我回去，我要回国！”他把国民党匪帮的帽徽和胸章扔在地上，不看美方
  “代表”一眼，匆匆地朝申请遣返的门走去。
    今天申请遣返的战俘，在申请遣返以后，仍然对特务分子非常恐惧。几乎所有战俘在走出解释帐篷时都问：“出去保险不保险？”他们一边问，一边就往等待遣返的帐篷的路上跑，怕有特务追来。
    和以前一样，我方的解释工作仍然受到美方的阻挠。
    在B一号解释场所，很多战俘在进解释帐篷前被迫在脸上抹着锅灰，头上戴着纸做的二尺多高的白帽子。印度部队把他们的锅灰擦掉，再带进解释帐篷听解释。
    混在战俘中间的蒋匪特务用拍桌子、顿足、歇斯底里的叫骂等手段进行捣乱。在第七号帐篷，一个特务竟公然说：“我就是特务！”在第二十七号帐篷，一个特务叫喊道：“要回国的人就应该杀，而且杀的太少了！”在二十八号帐篷有两个冒充战俘的特务因不服从附属机构主席，违反规则，当场被逮捕。
    在第二十七号帐篷，有一个满脸横肉的冒充战俘的特务分子。在解释代表指出张子龙被特务谋害的事实时，他竟大声说：“就是要杀死他！要回国的人我们统统要杀死他，不但要杀死他，而且要挖他心，剥他皮，抽他筋！”当时美方“翻译”人员对于特务的供词竟不予翻译。我方翻译人员照实翻译给在场的附属机构中立国人员听以后，他们都大为震惊。此外，还有二、三十名“战俘”假装听解释，然后用美国特务机关CIE所发“质问共产党解释代表的问题”来捣乱，拖延时间。
    美方的“观察代表”、“拘留一方代表”和
  “翻译”也继续公然以各种手段恐吓战俘，阻止战俘遣返。在第十八号帐篷，美方的“拘留一方代表”经常向战俘打手势、要战俘往尚未申请遣返的门走。我方观察代表向附属机构印度主席提出抗议后，印度主席就向这个美方“代表”说：“不但朝中方面观察代表看到了你这种行动，我们也看到了。我警告你再不能这么作。”可是当我方解释代表告诉战俘在申请遣返后就可由中立国负责遣返时，这个美方“代表”竟又违反“工作细则”插进来说：“这里哪里有中立国？这里只有附属机构”。印度主席当即命令他闭口，并告诉他：“这对中立国是一种侮辱。”在第十八号帐篷，美方“观察代表”在退出帐篷，让战俘考虑遣返时，故意走在最后，右手暗暗地在屁股旁边向“未申请遣返”的门竭力摆动，威胁战俘从那个门出去。在第三十号帐篷，我方解释代表指责美方“翻译”在翻译上的错误时，美方
  “翻译”竟破口大骂说：“你们放屁！”在第十号帐篷，一个高个子、戴眼镜的美方“翻译”竟指着尚未申请遣返的门厉声对战俘说：“这就是去台湾的门！”这个人姓李，是一个台湾国民党特务，曾命令战俘撕毁姓名卡片，使印度部队不能辨认安插在战俘中的特务。
    今天有四架美国喷气式飞机在解释场所附近盘旋，发出威胁性的喧闹声音，企图增加听解释的战俘的疑惧心理。
    今天美方新闻记者表现出和前几天在松谷里相似的失望神情。他们在上午看到有十几个他们叫做
  “宁死不愿遣返”的战俘申请遣返以后，下午就很少再出现了。
    今天东场里解释工作进行的情况，有力地证明了美方所以坚持其无理主张，要在十二月二十三日结束解释工作，其目的就是为了剥夺战俘听取解释、申请遣返的机会，使它的“心理战”得以避免遭到更可耻的失败。
