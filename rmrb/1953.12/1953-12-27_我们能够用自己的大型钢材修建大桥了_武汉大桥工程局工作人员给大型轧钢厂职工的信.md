    We can now build bridges with our own large steel
    — A letter from Wuhan Bridge Engineering Bureau staff to the workers of the large steel rolling plant
    To all the comrades of Anshan Iron and Steel Company and the Large Steel Rolling Plant:

    Under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and with the comprehensive assistance of the great Soviet government, and through the active efforts of all comrades, as the motherland begins its Five-Year Construction Plan, our country's first modernized steel rolling plant has successfully completed its trial operation and is about to begin production. This is another great victory in our country's industrial construction, and the people of the whole country are cheering for the great success of this construction. We workers of the Wuhan Bridge Construction Project are extremely excited. We extend our warm congratulations to you and pay our highest respects to the Soviet experts who helped with this construction project!

    The Wuhan Bridge is one of the key projects in our country's construction, and the entire project must be completed using modern scientific technology and making full use of the motherland's human and material resources. The project is vast, and the steel beams of the bridge alone require more than 20,000 tons of various large rolled steel. Now that the large steel rolling plant has been successfully built, our country can for the first time use large steel produced by our own motherland to build our country's first bridge. What an exciting and encouraging thing this is. This further inspires us to advance victoriously. After all our staff heard the news of the successful hot rolling trial of the large steel rolling plant, they all made a guarantee to implement planned management, shorten the preparation work for the bridge to the minimum, and launch a production increase and economy labor competition during the construction process, and join hands with you to strive for the bright future of the motherland's industrialization!

      With respectful greetings,

    Peng Min, Director of Wuhan Bridge Engineering Bureau, and all staff
                      December 1, 1953

    我们能够用自己的大型钢材修建大桥了
    ——武汉大桥工程局工作人员给大型轧钢厂职工的信鞍山钢铁公司并大型轧钢厂全体职工同志们：
    在毛主席的正确领导和伟大苏联政府的全面帮助下，在同志们的积极努力下，当祖国开始五年建设计划的时候，我国第一座近代化的轧钢厂胜利完成试运转工作，即将开始生产了。这是我国工业建设中又一伟大胜利，全国人民都为这一建设的伟大成功而欢呼。我们武汉大桥修建工程的工作者感到无比的兴奋。谨向你们致以热烈的祝贺，并向帮助这一建设工程的苏联专家致以崇高的敬礼！
    武汉大桥是我国建设工程中的重点工程之一，全部工程须采用近代化的科学技术，并充分利用祖国的人力物力来完成。工程浩大，光是大桥的钢梁就需要各种大型轧钢材二万多吨。现在大型轧钢厂建设成功，使我国第一次能够用祖国自己生产的大型钢材，来修建我国第一座大桥了。这是一件多么令人欢欣鼓舞的事情啊。这就更加鼓舞了我们的胜利前进。当我们全体职工听到了大型轧钢厂热试轧成功的消息以后，都提出了保证，要实行计划管理，将大桥的准备工作缩短到最低限度，并在施工中间开展增产节约劳动竞赛，和你们共同携起手来，为祖国工业化的美好将来而奋斗！
      此致敬礼
    武汉大桥工程局局长彭敏及全体工作人员
                      一九五三年十二月一日
