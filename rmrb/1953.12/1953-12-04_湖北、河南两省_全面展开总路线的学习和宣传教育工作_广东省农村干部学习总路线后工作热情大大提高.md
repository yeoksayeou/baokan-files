Hubei and Henan Provinces have comprehensively launched the study and publicity education work of the general line and general task.

In Hubei Province, 250,000 cadres have participated in the study of the general line, and some regions have already publicized it to the masses through these cadres. In organizing the study, Hubei Province focuses on deeply resolving ideological problems to make the study more thorough. Generally, various localities use a large amount of practical material based on issues such as "current interests and long-term interests" and "the two roads of socialism and capitalism," mobilizing everyone for repeated discussions. For example, at a meeting of cadres in Wuchang County, starting with discussions on how to consolidate national defense and increase agricultural production, they naturally further understood the importance of developing heavy industry and transforming the small-peasant economy. Many mutual aid team leader training classes used methods of recalling comparisons and calculating detailed accounts to conduct education on the two lines, making the mutual aid team leaders realize the harm of capitalism to them and the beautiful prospects of socialism, which was very effective. Many mutual aid team leaders in Baishi Township, Xishui County, reflected: "In the past, we were confused, but this time we understood the danger of taking the capitalist road. We must work hard to produce and support industrial construction and take the socialist road to everyone's happiness."

In Henan Province, the CCP committees above the county level have held expanded committee meetings and meetings of party member representatives to convey and study the general line. In the province, the main cadres of districts and townships who participated in county-level meetings alone numbered 50,000 to 60,000.机关干部以上的全省专区has universally launched the study of the general line, and many departments have inspected and deployed work in accordance with the spirit of the general line. The mutual aid and cooperation training class held by the Rural Work Department of the CCP Henan Provincial Committee spent eight days in twenty days studying the general line. Cities and counties such as Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Xinxiang, and Anyang have begun to conduct publicity among workers and citizens.

In order to better carry out the publicity of the general line, Hubei and Henan Provinces have transferred a large number of cadres to go deep into various parts of the province to specifically help and guide. The CCP Hubei Provincial Committee transferred more than 1,600 cadres from provincial-level agencies under the leadership of Liu Zihou, Second Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, Liu Xiyao, First Deputy Secretary, and Cheng Tan, Second Deputy Secretary, to go to certain counties in Huanggang, Jingzhou, Xiaogan and other prefectures to provide specific guidance and assistance. At the same time, the CCP Hubei Provincial Committee sent a work team to Wuchang County, deeply into the townships, to carry out publicity and education to the peasants in order to create experience for promotion. The CCP Henan Provincial Committee and local committees and some county committees also transferred a large number of cadres to the countryside to carry out extensive publicity activities to district and township cadres and the masses.

The vast number of rural work cadres in Guangdong Province have greatly improved their political awareness and work enthusiasm after studying the general line of the state's transition period.

Since the beginning of November, leading organs at all levels of the Communist Party of China in Guangdong Province have universally conveyed the general line of the state's transition period and the resolutions of the First Party Representative Conference of the CCP South China District to the vast number of rural cadres. Now, except for the Hainan District, cadres above the district level in the four districts of northern Guangdong, eastern Guangdong, western Guangdong, and central Guangdong have studied the general line of the state's transition period. Cadres in various localities have conducted studies of the general line in conjunction with inspection and deployment of work. Cadres in northern Guangdong criticized certain right-leaning views that existed in their past work during their studies. Cadres in Huiyang County reviewed that although the county's mutual aid and cooperation movement had achieved results, it still could not keep up with the demands of the situation. Based on everyone's opinions, the CCP Huiyang County Committee formulated a plan for future development of rural mutual aid and cooperation. After studying, cadres in various localities greatly improved their class consciousness and work enthusiasm. Pan Zhanmin, a cadre in the eighth district of Huiyang County, criticized his idea of taking surplus grain for lending during his studies and decided to persuade his mother to sell the surplus grain to the state after returning home. After studying, cadres in various districts of Suixi County wrote letters to the Party Committee expressing their determination to do a good job in rural work. Ye Rirong, a cadre in the twelfth district of Huiyang County, said: "I used to think that there was nothing to do in the countryside after the land reform was completed, and my mood was not high. Now I know that the country is going to transition to socialism, and we must vigorously carry out the socialist transformation of the countryside, so I am determined to do a good job in rural work."

    湖北、河南两省
    全面展开总路线的学习和宣传教育工作
    广东省农村干部学习总路线后工作热情大大提高
    湖北、河南两省已全面展开总路线总任务的学习和宣传教育工作。
    湖北省已有二十五万干部参加总路线的学习，有的地区已通过这些干部向广大群众进行宣传。湖北省各地在组织学习中，特别注意深入解决思想问题，使学习更加深入；各地一般都根据“目前利益与长远利益”、“社会主义与资本主义两条道路”等问题，摆出大量实际材料，发动大家进行反复讨论。如武昌县干部会上，从讨论如何巩固国防及提高农业生产等问题着手，很自然地便进一步了解到发展重工业、改造小农经济的重要性。不少互助组长训练班采用回忆对比和算细账的方法进行两条路线的教育，使互助组长们认识到资本主义对他们的危害和社会主义的美丽远景，收效很大。浠水县白石乡许多互助组长反映说：“过去我们是糊里糊涂的，这次才明白了走资本主义道路的危险，我们一定要努力生产支援工业建设，走大家幸福的社会主义道路。”
    河南省县以上的中共党委都召开了党委扩大会议和党员代表会议，传达和学习了总路线。全省仅参加县一级会议的区、乡主要干部就有五、六万人。全省专区以上的机关干部已普遍展开了总路线的学习，许多部门并根据总路线的精神检查和布置了工作。中共河南省委农村工作部举办的互助合作训练班，在二十天中就以八天的时间进行总路线的学习。开封、郑州、新乡、安阳等市县已开始在工人和市民中间进行宣传。
    为了更好地开展总路线的宣传，湖北、河南两省都抽调出大批干部深入本省各地具体帮助和指导。中共湖北省委从省级机关抽调了一千六百多名干部在省委第二书记刘子厚、第一副书记刘西尧、第二副书记程坦率领下，分头深入到黄冈、荆州、孝感等专区的某些县份进行具体指导和帮助工作。同时，中共湖北省委并派出工作组到武昌县，深入到乡，向农民展开宣传教育，以创造经验，进行推广。中共河南省委和各地委及一部分县委也抽调了大批干部下乡，向区乡干部和广大群众展开广泛的宣传活动。  （据新华社讯）
    广东省广大农村工作干部学习国家过渡时期的总路线后，政治觉悟和工作热情大大提高。
    从十一月上旬开始，中国共产党广东省各级领导机关都普遍向广大农村干部传达了国家过渡时期的总路线和中国共产党华南区第一次党代表会议的决议。现在，全省除海南区外，粤北、粤东、粤西和粤中四个区区级以上的干部都进行了国家过渡时期总路线的学习。各地干部在学习总路线时，都是结合检查和布置工作进行的。粤北区干部在学习中，批判了过去工作中存在的某些右倾观点。惠阳县干部在学习中，检讨出全县的互助合作运动虽有成绩，但仍赶不上形势的要求。中共惠阳县委根据大家的意见，订出了今后发展农村互助合作的计划。各地干部经过学习后，大大提高了阶级觉悟和工作热情。惠阳县第八区干部潘展民在学习中批判了自己打算把余粮拿去放债的思想，决定回家后劝母亲把余粮卖给国家。遂溪县各区干部经过学习，纷纷写信给党委表示要做好农村工作的决心。惠阳县十二区干部叶日荣说：“我过去以为土地改革完成后，农村就没啥工作可做，情绪不高。现在知道国家要过渡到社会主义，要大力进行农村的社会主义改造工作，因此我决心要做好农村工作。”  （新华社）
