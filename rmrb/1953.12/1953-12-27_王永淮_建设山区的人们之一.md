Wang Yonghuai
——One of the People Building the Mountainous Areas
Qin Zhaoyang

Are you asking about Wang Yonghuai? You've come to the right place, I know him well. You're going to the seventh district, so we're going the same way. I'll tell you about him then.

Speaking of him, in a word: he's a good man. Now he's been elected Deputy County Magistrate of Xingtai County, but he's still just as good.

Look at these mountains along the road, these don't count as mountains. Look to the west, see that mist obscuring half the sky, that's what you call mountains! People used to living on the plains get worried when they see these endless wild mountains and ridges for the first time. Even those of us born in the mountains get worried sometimes. You wouldn't know it, but a few years ago, many people wanted to move out of the mountains, to settle in Shanxi. Even I was like that, always feeling that I had no future stuck in a poor mountain ravine for the rest of my life. But Wang Yonghuai likes these mountains. He's been in those big mountains to the west, year after year, climbing mountains and crossing ridges, doing things for the people, making everyone like the mountains and making everyone more and more energetic. Isn't that strange?

He entered the mountains in 1950.

It was springtime then. I was hoeing wheat seedlings in the fields at the head of the village when I suddenly looked up and saw a man coming down the mountain ridge from the east, carrying a bedroll on a pole, walking very fast. I thought, "Isn't that Wang Yonghuai from our village?" When he got closer, it was indeed him. You don't know, we used to herd sheep together when we were kids, and later we worked in the fields together. After the War of Resistance, he joined the work, and we often met when he came home. I greeted him:

    "Is that you, Brother Yonghuai?"
    "Yes, are you hoeing the ground?"
    "Yeah, are you coming home for a visit?"
    "No. I've been transferred, I'm coming back to the mountains."
    "Oh--" I said "oh" like that, but didn't say the words below.

You don't know, it wasn't long after liberation then. People working in the old base areas in the mountains all wanted to be transferred to the plains, to the big places (big cities), feeling that after spending more than ten years in mountain ravines, they were liberated, but it was worthless still being stuck in a poor mountain ravine. But Wang Yonghuai had only been out for more than a year, and I heard that he was the head of a section in the county. How come he's coming back to the mountains?

It wasn't early, so I followed him towards the village, carrying a hoe, and wondering in my heart, but not wanting to ask him directly, I asked in a roundabout way:

    "Brother Yonghuai, you've been in a big place for more than a year, aren't you uncomfortable coming back here?"
    "Why would I be uncomfortable? Look at me, isn't I the same as I was when I was in the mountains a few years ago?"

I looked, and it was true: he was still wearing an old gray coarse cloth uniform, and because he was hot from walking, the uniform hat was buttoned on the back of his head, revealing half of his bald head, a yellow, sweaty face, smiling as he spoke; on his feet, he was still wearing the mountain shoes he wore in earlier years; I recognized his bedroll, it was still the old quilt from two or three years ago, thin, without even a sheet.

I was even more puzzled in my heart, so I tried asking him again:

    "I heard you were the head of a section in the county..."
    "Yes, I was," he was still smiling, the same as always, speaking in a low voice.

I asked him again: "Are you still the head of a section now?"

    "This time I came to the mountains to be the head of the seventh district." He was still smiling, not panicking.

I was even more puzzled in my heart: "How could he be the head of a section and then come back to be the head of a district?..." At that time, I thought the head of a section was a higher level than the head of a district.

When we entered the village, he greeted people he met on the street, and I deliberately told people loudly:

    "Brother Yonghuai has entered the mountains again, and is the head of the seventh district!"

But guess what? He was even happier, and said loudly to people:

    "Yes, I've entered the mountains again, and I'm with the folks again!"

I followed him all the way into his house. His wife was sewing shoe soles on the kang, and when she saw him come in, she happily got off the kang and took the jujube wood stick he was using to carry the quilt.

I deliberately said loudly again: "Sister-in-law, that's great, Brother Yonghuai has been transferred to the mountains!"

Her face was originally smiling, but at this time she suddenly froze, her eyes rolled, but she didn't say anything.

After a while, the room was full of people, his uncle, his mother-in-law, and several other old women and old men, all neighbors, all looking at him without speaking, as if looking at someone who had been unlucky outside.

His uncle was a peasant who had been emancipated, over fifty years old, and like me, he was a bit unclear at that time. He looked at Yonghuai up and down for a long time, and then touched the bedroll he had put on the kang, and said:

    "Yonghuai, don't say I said it. Do you remember Zhao Ruiqi from our village? I heard that he hasn't become the head of a section yet, but he came back a few days ago, wearing new clothes all over, one pack of cigarettes a day, going in and out on a bicycle. But how have you been doing these years, how could you..."

Before he could finish his words, his old woman—Yonghuai's aunt—interrupted:

    "Child, when girls here look for a husband, those in the mountains want to find those outside the mountains, those above the mountains want to find those below the mountains, but you, it's like marrying a daughter to the mountains, you'll never be able to get down the mountains!"

Her words were originally well-intentioned, she was pitying her son-in-law.

Guess what Yonghuai did? He was still like nothing had happened, smiling, drinking water from a bowl, and said:

    "Hehe, doing revolution is the same everywhere, someone has to do it in the mountains too."
    "Someone has to do it in the mountains, isn't ten years enough for you in the mountains? Can you do it in the mountains for a lifetime?" His old uncle was also speaking up for him.

Yonghuai was still smiling, and said: "I'm willing to do it in the mountains for a lifetime."

    "Do you really like these wild mountains and ridges like your mother-in-law said?"
    "Hehe, uncle," Yonghuai put the bowl on the table, still smiling, "uncle, don't look down on these poor mountains and ridges. Do you still remember? How many methods did the Japanese devils use to occupy this place! Later, how greedy was Chiang Kai-shek! How many people did they kill! We defeated the devils and defeated the old Chiang by relying on this kind of place. Do you remember? At that time, this was a guerrilla zone, and the devils built a wall a dozen miles east of our village, a blockade wall, wanting to trap us to death in the mountains?"

His old uncle said: "I remember, how could I not remember? Those days were so difficult!"

    "Those days were difficult, but what about now? Now it's our world. The higher-ups have long planned to build a car road, passing through our door, leading directly to Shanxi, so that the mountain goods here can be transported out..."
    "Really?" Several women exclaimed.
    "How could it not be true? The higher-ups want to strengthen the construction of mountainous areas."
    "How will they strengthen it?"
    "How will they strengthen it? They want to turn these poor mountains into rich mountains, and the mountains will produce gold."

His wife was cooking food by the stove door, and at this time she stood up and said with a smile:

    "How can you make our mountains produce gold?"
    "Everyone works hard and moves forward, and we can turn these barren mountains into gold mountains!"
    "Ha!" His wife laughed, "You want to build socialism in our narrow mountain ravine? With you, an old farmer, can you walk a path on this mountaintop?"
    "Why can't I? Wherever there are people, wherever there is the Communist Party, there is a path, and we can move towards socialism."

His mother-in-law interrupted again, she said:

    "Your own mother starved to death in this poor mountain ravine, and you still praise this mountain, I think you're a bit stupid!"

She was from this village, and she saw Yonghuai's mother starve to death with her own eyes, and what she said was completely the truth.

At this time, an old man sitting in the corner stood up, he was a distant uncle of Yonghuai, over seventy years old, with a strong body, and a buzzing voice like a chime:

    "In my opinion, Yonghuai's nephew is right, how can mountains not produce gold? Forty years ago, these mountains and fields were full of trees, and we didn't know what drought was. Don't older people remember? At that time, people had a common saying: 'Seven Li Shoal, Eight Li Bay, Sixty Li Road Cannot See the Sky.' Why couldn't they see the sky? The trees blocked it! Alas, later, people cut down trees and reclaimed wasteland indiscriminately. Since the beginning of the Republic of China, mountain floods have occurred year after year, and the mountains are bare!"

At this time, several people exclaimed: "That's right, it's still bare, can you make those trees grow again?"

The old man was discouraged and sat down again.

Wang Yonghuai took out his notebook and wrote something on it, muttering to himself with a smile:

    "...Sixty Li Road Cannot See the Sky...Can...Can..."

By the time he finished writing, the meal was ready. Yonghuai put away his notebook and was polite to everyone in the room for a long time, and then ate with big mouthfuls. You know, how difficult was people's life here at that time! Cornmeal cakes, tree leaf porridge, with sand inside. His wife was a farmer woman, and like the men and women of other families, she didn't have the habit of being clean because life was hard... But, look, he eats in big mouthfuls, as if he had never been to a big place before.

I remembered: there was a young man named Huang Wenjun in our village, who went south with the army two years ago and now works in a hospital in Henan Province. He came home at the beginning of this year, but left before two days were up. Why? Because he hated the hard life at home, and the food and sleep weren't hygienic.

I thought to myself: Yonghuai is really an honest person.

At this time, it wasn't early, and I went home to eat dinner. I put down the bowl and walked out the door, wow! The moon in the sky is really round... There's someone on the small hill opposite, who is it? Why isn't he moving? I bent down, and his black shadow was showing through the sky, (this is a good way to see people far away in the dark), exactly a side view, that hat brim, that nose and mouth, that figure, I recognized him at once, it was him.

What's going on? Could it be that his wife wasn't happy that he was the head of a section and then the head of a district, and the two of them had a fight? It shouldn't be, his wife is also quite progressive. Even if the two of them had a fight, standing on the top of this mountain is not a solution, he can't be so honest!

I pretended to be wandering around aimlessly, humming a little tune, going around from the west of the village, going up the mountain, walking up to him, and asking him:

    "You've walked seventy or eighty li today, aren't you tired? Why aren't you resting yet?"
    He said: "I'm not tired. Aren't you resting yet?"

I asked him again: "What are you looking at?"

He said: "Looking at this mountain."

I said: "You, do you really like this mountain?"

    "Hehehe," he smiled, "I haven't been home for more than a year, I want to see if our village has changed, and come out for a walk on a big moon night..." He pointed with his hand: "Look at those trees north of the village, are they chestnut trees? How many chestnuts can they produce in a year?"

I said: "They're the trees of Fool Lao Zheng's family, last autumn, I heard they produced three thousand catties."

    "Wow! That's a lot! Do you remember? There weren't these trees before the Incident, they must have been planted after the Incident, right? In just over ten years, they've had such a big harvest; now, Fool Lao Zheng's family isn't having a hard time, right?"
    "His family is doing pretty well..."

I said these words, but I really didn't know what he meant. He asked me again which family in the village had fruit trees, whether the production of persimmon trees was greater than that of chestnut trees, and whether apple and pear trees were easy to plant... We talked for a full meal before walking down the mountain together.

His wife was leaning against the door of the courtyard waiting for him, asking him if he was tired, and telling him that the wind on the top of the mountain was quite cold, and he wasn't even wearing a coat... He laughed and said a few words casually, and then went into the house, moved the lamp on the windowsill to the table, and took out his notebook to write.

His wife leaned against the table silently looking at him, a smile on the corner of her mouth, light in her eyes, for a long time before saying:

    "It's good to be transferred to the mountains..."

And said: "The words you're writing look a bit better than before..."

I suddenly thought: "The two of them are very affectionate, what am I doing here?" And quickly slipped out.

The next day, as soon as it was light, I carried a hoe to the field, and as soon as I walked out of the door, I saw Wang Yonghuai carrying a bedroll on a pole, walking down the river ditch in big steps; his wife was standing at the door of the courtyard, looking at him.

I said: "Brother Yonghuai, why are you leaving so early, aren't you resting at home for another day?"

He said: "Is it early? It's not early..."

His wife said: "You don't know, he got up as soon as the rooster crowed, urging me to cook for him, and he held a book under the light, like a student in school, reading word by word..."

I knew that she was also a Communist Party member, she was praising her man.

I said: "He's so engrossed in his work!"

    "Isn't that right? That's it..."

The words she said were trembling, and so gentle. I kept watching him cross the mountain ridge west of the village before turning around.

Comrade, I really didn't expect it, from the time he returned to the mountains, people changed day by day, I changed day by day, and even the production of our mountain land changed... Look at this car road, hasn't it really been built? Those terraced fields in that mountain recess are new this past winter, newly built; those people hoeing wheat in the fields are either mutual aid teams or agricultural production cooperatives; this stream beside the road didn't exist in earlier years, it's a small channel newly opened in the past two years; look again at the mountains on both sides, aren't there some stars of black-green in the yellowing withered grass after autumn? Those are the trees that the villages in our river valley jointly planted last spring, and our agricultural production cooperative alone has planted 6,000 mu in two years. Now I also love these big mountains and ridges, don't believe me, if there are shepherds walking on this "Forestry Mountain", I will definitely pull him by the collar to the township government...

I not only love this mountain, but also become obsessed with work. I joined the agricultural production cooperative and became an accountant, unable to sleep day and night, waking up before dawn. Today, I am representing our society to go to the Xingtai Bank to get a livestock loan. Our society's sheep, in 1951 there were a hundred, last year there were four or five hundred, this year, more than a thousand! We also want to expand, the sooner we get this loan, the sooner our society's sheep will develop. Today I set off at the crowing of the rooster, running fast, a round trip of one hundred and forty li, look, not far from our village, it's not dark yet!...

People all know what's good and bad. Everyone can see what kind of person Wang Yonghuai is.

Last October, the whole county launched an election to elect a new county magistrate. In our area, wherever you go, every village is considering Wang Yonghuai. We made a bet with Yonghuai's wife, saying to her:

    "If your man isn't elected county magistrate this time, we'll lose something to you!"

She said: "Hmph, him? Won't he be ashamed to death!"

    "Why would he be ashamed to death, isn't he a good person?" We were deliberately teasing her.

But she turned the false words into truth:

    "Speaking of study, he has been a model. He doesn't spend any of his own living expenses, and sends them all home, he's really not corrupt in life. He's really dedicated to his work..."
    "Ha!" People all laughed, "Then what shortcomings does he have?"

She also laughed. At that time she was happy, and we were also happy.

Later, you know, our village is the easternmost village in the seventh district, and also on the car road. The representatives to the county meeting passed by here, and we knew some of them, and we talked. They said: This is terrible, if District Chief Wang is elected county magistrate, wouldn't he stay in the county to work? Would he still return to the mountains? If we don't elect him, such a good person, we can't get over it in our hearts...—But that's it, will he still return to the mountains? Our seventh district has just been doing well, and a good cadre is going to be transferred away again!—We were just happy, and now we're disappointed again.

We wanted to wait for him to pass by and talk to him, to keep him. But he rushed to the county overnight, and we didn't wait for him.

A few days later, the representatives who attended the meeting returned, and we all greeted them at the entrance of the village, and as soon as we met, we asked:

    "What's wrong? Was he elected?"
    "Great!" The representatives laughed, "He's not leaving!"
    "What's wrong, wasn't he elected?" People were a little unhappy again.
    "He was elected, he became the deputy county magistrate."
    "If he becomes the deputy county magistrate, doesn't he still have to leave?"
    "Our representatives from the entire seventh district asked the higher-ups, and the higher-ups decided: to let him also serve as the district chief of the seventh district, responsible for the mountainous areas..."

Only then were people both happy and relieved...

Look, we're home while we're talking, the tree shadow in front is our West Huang Village, Wang Yonghuai's home is in the west end. If you don't believe me, ask around in our village (actually it's the same no matter which village you ask), I guarantee everyone will say: "Wang Yonghuai is a good person, a good district chief." Otherwise, why would people elect him as deputy county magistrate?

    王永淮
    ——建设山区的人们之一
    秦兆阳
    你打听王永淮吗？你算打听对了，我可跟他?熟。你到七区去，咱俩正好同道儿，我就跟你说说他的事儿吧。
    说起他来，一句话：是个好人。这如今他被人们选为邢台县人民政府副县长，可还是那么好。
    你看这沿路的山，这不算山。那西边，你瞅，雾朦朦遮住半边天，那才叫山呢！在平原上住惯了的人，乍一到咱这地方，看见这走不到头儿的荒山野岭，真要发愁呢。就是咱们生在山里的人，有时候也要发愁。你不知道，前几年，好多人都想往山外搬家，想到山西去安家。就连我也是这样，老觉着一辈子钻在穷山沟里头没出息。可是，王永淮这人欢喜这山，他就在西边那大山里边，年年月月，爬山过岭，为老百姓办事，弄得人人都欢喜这山，人人都越过越有劲，你说怪不？
    他是一九五○年进山的。
    那时，是个春天。我正在村头上地里耪麦苗儿，猛抬头，看见东边山梁上下来个人，用棍子挑着行李卷儿，走得挺快。我心想：“这不是咱村的王永淮吗？”走近了一看，果然。你不知道，俺们小时候在一块儿放过羊，后来又一块儿在地里干过活儿，抗战后他参加了工作，有时候回家，我们也常见面。我就跟他打招呼：
      “是永淮哥吗？”
      “是呀，你耪地？”
     “嗯，你这是回家来看看啦？”
      “不哩。我调了工作啦，回山里来啦。”
    “哦——”我这么“哦”了一声，下边的话没说出来。
    你不知道，那时刚解放不久，在山里老根据地工作的人们都讲究往平原上调，往大地方（大城市）调，都觉着：钻了十几年山沟，解放啦，还钻在穷山沟里，是没出息。可是，王永淮刚出去一年多，听说在县里当了科长，怎么又回山里来了呢？
    天也不早了，我一边扛着锄跟着他往村里走，
  一边在心里纳闷儿，可又不好直出直入地问他，就拐着弯儿说：
      “永淮哥，你出去在大地方待了一年多，这乍
  一回来，怕有些待不惯吧？”
      “怎么待不惯？你看我，不是跟那几年在山里的时候一样吗？”
    我一看，可真是：他浑身上下还是旧灰粗布制服，因为走热了，制服帽子往脑袋后边扣着，露出半边光头，一张黄油油冒汗的脸，说话笑眯眯的；脚上，也还是早些年穿的那山岗子鞋；他那铺盖卷儿，我还认得，还是两三年以前的那条旧被，薄薄的，连个褥子单子的都没有。
    我心里就更纳闷儿，就又试着问他：
      “听说你在县里当了科长哩……”
      “嗯，是，”他还是笑眯眯的，跟往日一样，说话声音不高。
    我又问他：“你这会儿还是科长吗？”
      “这回进山，当了七区的区长啦。”他还是笑眯眯的，不慌不忙的样儿。
    我心里就更纳闷儿了：“怎么当了科长又反转来当区长哩？……”当时我以为科长比区长高一级哩。
    进了村，街上碰见人他就打招呼，我就故意大声告诉人：
  “永淮哥又进了山啦，当了七区的区长啦！”
    可你猜怎么着？他反倒更高兴，也大声对人说：
    “是又进了山啦，又跟乡亲们在一块儿啦！”
    我一直跟着他进了他家院子。他媳妇正在炕上衲鞋底子，一看见他进来了，喜的连忙下了炕，接过他挑被子的枣木棍儿。
    我又故意大声说：“嫂子，这可好啦，永淮哥调到山里来啦！”
    她脸上本来是挂着笑的，这时猛地一楞，眼珠子一转，可也没说什么。
    一会，屋子里挤满了人，有他叔，他岳母，还有别的几个老婆老头，都是邻壁左右的人们，都瞅着他不说话，像是瞅一个在外边混倒了霉的人一样。
    他叔是个翻身农民，五十多岁，跟我一样，那时也有点认识不清。他朝永淮浑身上下瞅了半天，又摸了摸他搁在炕上的铺盖卷儿，说：
    “永淮，你别说我说。你记得咱村的赵瑞启吧？听说还没有当到科长哩，可人家，前几天回来了一趟，浑身上下新衣裳，一天一盒烟卷儿，出进骑自行车。可你这些年是怎么干的，你怎么……”
    他的话还没说完，他老婆子——永淮的婶子又接了腔：
      “孩子，咱这里闺女寻人家，山里边的想寻山外边的，山上边的想寻山下边的，可你，就像嫁给山里边的闺女似的，一辈子也下不了山啦！”
    她这话原是好意，她是可怜她女婿哩。
    你猜咱永淮怎么着？他还是没事人似的，笑眯眯，一边捧着碗喝水，一边说：
   “嘿嘿，干革命哪儿都一样，山里边也得有人干啦。”
      “山里边也得有人干，你在山里干了十来年还不行？你能在山里干一辈子吗？”他老叔也是在替他叫屈呢。
    永淮还是笑眯眯的，说：“在山里干一辈子我也愿意。”
      “你真的像你岳母说的，爱上这荒山野岭啦？”
      “嘿嘿，老叔，”永淮把碗往桌子上一搁，还是笑眯眯的，“老叔，你别看不起这穷山野岭。你还记得吧？日本鬼子用了多少办法想占咱这地方！后来蒋介石又多么眼馋！他们杀过咱们多少人！咱们就是凭着这样地方打败了鬼子，打败了老蒋。你记得吧？那时咱这儿是游击区，鬼子在咱村东十几里路的地方修了道墙，封锁墙，想把咱困死在山里？”
    他老叔说：“记得，咋不记得呢？那时的日月可困难多啦！”
      “那时困难多啦，现在可怎么样呢？现在是咱们的世界啦，上级早计划好了，要修一条汽车路，经过咱这门口，直通山西，让咱这里的山货能往外运……”
     “真的吗？”好几个娘儿们都叫起来了。
    “怎么不是真的？上级要加强山区建设。”
   “咋个加强法？”
    “咋加强吗？要叫咱这穷山变富山，山里出黄金。”
    他媳妇正在灶门口烧火作饭，这时站起身来，笑着说：
    “你咋能叫咱这山里出黄金？”
   “大伙儿努力往前奔，就能叫这荒山变成金山！”
    “哈！”他媳妇笑了，“你想在咱这个窄山沟里建设社会主义吧？凭你这个庄稼老粗，还能在这大山顶上走出一条道儿来？”
    “怎么不能？哪儿有人，哪儿有共产党，哪儿就有道儿，就能往社会主义走。”
    他岳母又插嘴了，她说：
    “你那亲娘就是在这穷山沟儿里饿死的，你还夸这山呢，我看你是有些傻！”
    她是本村的人，永淮的娘饿死的事，她是亲眼看见了的，说的完全是实话。
    这时候，坐在那边角儿上的一个老头站起来了，是永淮的一个远房大伯，七十多岁，身子挺壮，说话声音嗡嗡的，像敲钟一样：
    “依我看，永淮侄子说的对，这山上怎么不能出黄金？倒过去四十年，这满山遍野都是树，就不知道什么叫干旱水潦。你们年岁大点的人不记得吗？那时候，人们有句俗话：‘七里滩，八里湾，六十里路不见天。’怎么不见天呢？是树遮住啦！ 咳，后来，人们乱砍乱伐，乱开荒，从民国初年以来，连年发山水，这山就光啦！”
    这时有好几个人都叫起来啦：“还是呀，还是光了呀，你能叫那些树再长起来吗？”
    老头子泄了气，又坐下了。
    王永淮掏出小本儿来，在上边写着什么，一边笑眯眯地自言自语：
    “……六十里路不见天……能……能……”
    等他写完了，正好饭也熟了。永淮收起了小本儿，对满屋子人客气了半天，就大口大口地吃起来了。你知道，那时候咱这里人们的生活是多苦！糠饼子，树叶粥，里边还净是砂子。他媳妇是个庄稼女人，也跟别人家的男人女人一样，因为生活苦，没价爱干净的习惯，……可是，你瞅，他大口大口地吃，就像没有到过大地方的人一样。
    我想起来了：咱村有个叫黄文俊的小伙子，前两年随着部队南下，现在在河南省一个什么卫生院里工作，今年年初回了一趟家，没住满两天就走了，为什么？就为的嫌家里生活苦，吃的睡的都不卫生。
    我心想：永淮这人真是个老实人。
    这时天不早了，我也回家吃了晚饭。我撂下碗走出门来，喝！天空上那月亮真圆……对面小山岗上有个人，是谁？怎么一动也不动？我一弯腰，他的黑影儿透在天空上，（这是黑夜里远处看人的好办法），正好是个侧面，那帽沿儿，那鼻子嘴，那身形，我一下子认出来了，原来是他。
    是怎么回事呢？莫非他媳妇不高兴他当了科长又当区长，两口子吵了架？按说，也不至于，他媳妇也是挺进步的哩。就是两口子吵了架，上这山头上立着也不是个办法呀，他老实也不能老实到这样呀！
    我就装做闲着没事瞎蹓躂，嘴里哼着小曲儿，从西边村头上绕过去，上了山，走到他跟前，问他：
    “你今日走了七八十里，不累？怎么还不歇着？”
    他说：“不累。你也还没歇着？”
    我又问他：“你瞅啥？”
    他说：“瞅这山哩。”
    我说：“你这人，你真的欢喜这山啦？”
   “嘿嘿嘿，”他笑了笑，“一年多没回家，想看看咱村这样儿变了没有，大月亮夜，出来走走……”又用手一指：“你看村北边那几棵树，是栗子树吧？一年能出多少栗子？”
    我说：“是傻老正家的树，头年秋天，听说出了三千来斤。”
   “喝！真不少！你记得吧？事变以前还没价这几棵树哩，准是事变以后栽的吧？才十几年，就有这么大收成；这如今，傻老正家的日子不作难啦吧？”
      “他家倒是过得挺暖和……”
    我口里这么说着，心里可真不知道他是什么意思。他又问我村里谁家还有果木树，是柿子树的出产大还是栗子树的出产大，苹果树和梨树好不好栽种……我们足足谈了一顿饭的工夫，才一块儿往山下走。
    他媳妇正靠在院子门口等着他哩，问他累不累，又说他：山头上风挺凉，也不披着件衣裳。……他呵呵地笑着，随口说了几句什么，就走进屋里去，把窗台上的灯亮儿挪到桌子上，又掏出小本儿写起来。
    他媳妇靠在桌子一边不声不响地瞅着他，嘴角上挂着笑，眼里放着光，半天半天，才说：
      “调到山里了，也好……”
    又说：“看你写的这字，像是比早先顺眼点了……”
    我心里猛地想起来了：“人家两口子挺亲热的，我在这儿呆着干吗？”就赶紧蹓出来了。
    第二天天刚亮，我扛着锄下地，刚走出大门，就看见王永淮用棍子挑着行李卷儿，大步大步地走下河沟来；他媳妇立在院子门口，瞅着他。
    我说：“永淮哥，怎么这么早就走，不在家里多歇一天？”
    他说：“还早吗？不早……”
    他媳妇说：“你才不知道哩，刚一鸡叫他就起来了，催着我给他作饭，他自个就着灯亮儿捧着本书，像学校里的小学生似的，一个字一个字地念……”
    我知道，她也是个共产党员，她是在夸她男人呢。
    我说：“他是干工作干入了迷啦！”
      “可不？就是……”
    她这几个字说得声音发颤，又那么柔和。我一直瞅着他翻过了村西边的山梁儿，才转过身来。
    同志，真没想到呀，从他一回到山里，人们就一天一天的变啦，我也一天一天的变啦，连咱山地的出产也变啦……你瞅这汽车路，不是真的修了吗？那边那山凹凹里一溜子梯田，是去年冬天才有的，是新垒起来的；那边那地里耩麦子的人们，不是互助组的就是农业生产合作社的；这道边上的流水沟，早些年也没有，是这两年新开的小渠道；你再瞅这两边山上，那秋后刚刚发黄的枯草里边，不是有一些星星点点儿的黑绿色儿吗？那是前年春天俺们一条川的村子联合起来植的树，光俺们农业生产合作社两年当中就植了六千亩。这如今我也爱上了这大山大岭啦，不信，要是有放羊打柴的走上这“育林山”，我准得扯着他的领口上乡政府去……
    我不光爱这山，对工作也入了迷。我入了农业生产合作社，当了会计，黑间白日睡不着觉，早晨天不亮就醒。今日，我是代表咱社到邢台银行里去取牧畜贷款的。咱社里的羊，一九五一年是一百只，去年就有四五百只啦，今年呢，一千多！咱还要扩大，这款子早取到手一天，咱社里的羊群就早发展一天。今日我鸡叫出发，紧跑紧赶，来回一百四十里，你看，离咱村不远了，天还没黑哩！……
    人们谁也是知道好歹的。谁也看出王永淮是个什么样的人来了。
    去年十月，咱全县发动选举，选新县长。俺们这一带，你走到哪村，哪村在酝酿王永淮。俺们找永淮的媳妇打赌，对她说：
    “你家那人这回要不当选县长，俺们输给你点什么！”
    她说：“哼，他？不臊死他！”
    “咋的臊死他，他不是个好人吗？”俺们是有意这么逗她的。
    她可就把假话说成真话了：
    “说学习，他可是当过模范。自个的生活费一点也不花，都捎的家来了，生活上可真不腐化。对工作，也真是尽心……”
    “哈！”人们都笑了，“那你说他还有啥缺点呢？”
    她也笑了。当时她高兴，俺们也高兴。
    后来，你知道，俺这村是七区最东边的一个村，又正在汽车路上，到县里开会的代表们走这儿路过，俺们有认得的，说起话来。他们说：这可坏啦，王区长要是当选了县长，还不留在县里工作？还回山吗？不选他吧，这么好的人，心里又过不去……——可就是，他还回山吗？咱七区刚搞得不错了，好干部又要调走了！——俺们刚刚还在高兴呢，这一下又败兴起来啦。
    俺们想等他路过的时候对他说说，留留他。可他是连夜赶到县里去的，俺们没等着他。
    过了几天，开会的代表们回来了，俺们都到村口上迎着他们，一见了面就问：
    “咋哩？他选上了吗？”
    “好啦！”代表们一片笑声，“他不走啦！”
    “咋哩，没选上吗？”人们又有些不高兴了。
    “选上啦，当了副县长啦。”
    “当了副县长还不是要走？”
      “俺们全七区的代表找上级要求，上级就决定了：叫他还兼七区区长，负责山区……”
    人们这一下才算又高兴又放心了。……
    你看，咱说着说着就到家啦，前面那树影子就是俺们西黄村，王永淮的家在西头。不信你在咱村打听打听（其实你到哪村里打听也一样），保险人人都说：“王永淮那人可没错儿，是个好区长。”要不，人们干吗选他当副县长？
