Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 17th: Our correspondent reports: Dean, who single-handedly interrupted the talks and put the political conference in the deep freeze, has fully exposed that the U.S. side is undermining the political conference precisely to facilitate its plan to forcibly detain prisoners of war. The day after the talks were interrupted, Dean lost no time in indicating the U.S. intention to detain prisoners of war at all costs. On the 14th, Dean then announced that the U.S. side would deploy troops to "ensure" that Syngman Rhee could successfully kidnap the prisoners of war. Following these statements, the U.S. military immediately responded. According to the Associated Press, General Taylor, commander of the U.S. Eighth Army in Korea, said on the 15th that the Eighth Army was "drawing up plans" to "receive" prisoners of war kidnapped from the neutral zone after January 23, 1954. Taylor said that the "first step" would be to "transport" the prisoners of war "from the neutral zone north of Munsan," and then "Korean prisoners will be handed over to the South Korean government, and Chinese prisoners will be transported to Nationalist China in Taiwan."

    The U.S. side's open encouragement and assistance to Syngman Rhee in implementing his plot to forcibly detain prisoners of war, thereby undermining the Korean armistice, has seriously threatened the stability of the Korean armistice.

    However, in order to conceal the seriousness of the Korean situation from the world and to preemptively shirk responsibility for Syngman Rhee's actions in undermining the Korean armistice, the U.S. side is currently playing its most skilled magician's trick, deliberately releasing smoke screens to deceive world public opinion. On his way back to Washington after completing his pre-planned mission of disrupting the bilateral talks, Dean once again spread an "optimistic" atmosphere. Dean told reporters in Tokyo on the 15th that he "believed that talks to arrange a Korean peace conference would resume, although he could not predict when." In order to cover up the U.S.-orchestrated, scheduled act of perfidy of instructing Syngman Rhee to forcibly detain prisoners of war and undermine the armistice, Dean deliberately stated that he was "confident" that even if the "peace conference does not convene immediately, South Korean President Syngman Rhee will not restart the war." At the same time, Syngman Rhee was ordered to change his tune and follow Dean, saying that "he would give the Korean political conference a full ninety days to resolve the Korean issue, regardless of when the conference begins." Dean attempted to use this tone, which appeared to be moderate but still clamored for war, to conceal his plot to forcibly detain prisoners of war and undermine the Korean armistice. Dean and Syngman Rhee's trickery is clearly aimed at deceiving those countries that follow the United States, so that they can be dragged into the abyss together.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 17th: Our correspondent reports: Dean, who completed the task of disrupting the bilateral talks in order to forcibly detain prisoners of war, is currently continuing to display his talents for distorting the truth, slandering, and denying, which he consistently displayed at Panmunjom, on his way back to Washington, in order to shirk responsibility for the U.S. side's actions in undermining the armistice agreement and forcibly detaining prisoners of war.

    In a statement issued in Tokyo on the 15th, Dean said: "The Communists are deliberately delaying the preparatory meeting because they dare not bring the issue of non-repatriated prisoners of war to the meeting." On the 16th, Dean again said in Honolulu, his next stop: "The Communists use delaying tactics as their entire capital... The Communists have always used negotiations as their propaganda platform. This is the entirety of their psychological warfare." Dean's counter-accusation only serves to expose the desperate attempts to evade the righteous condemnation of world public opinion and to counter the relentless exposure by the Korean and Chinese sides of the U.S. side's entire plot to undermine the armistice agreement, stifle the political conference, and forcibly detain prisoners of war. Dean, finding himself with no way out, even fantasized about reversing the accusations of the Korean and Chinese sides in order to escape the U.S. side's position as the accused. Dean himself has made it clear what trick he is using: "We must use their own methods to deal with them."

    But Dean's clumsy trick cannot fool people. The records of the Panmunjom bilateral talks prove that the Korean and Chinese sides have consistently and firmly opposed the U.S. side's deliberate obstruction of the convening of the political conference and its plot to delay past the so-called prisoner of war detention deadline of January 22 next year in order to forcibly detain prisoners of war. The Korean and Chinese sides insisted that the political conference should resolve the "handling of prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to be repatriated" in accordance with the provisions of the "terms of reference." In the comprehensive proposal put forward by the Korean and Chinese sides on November 30, the first item on the agenda of the political conference was "the prisoner of war issue." The Korean and Chinese representatives also pointed out that no matter when the political conference is delayed due to the obstruction of the U.S. side, the political conference must first discuss and resolve the prisoner of war issue. But, on the contrary, the U.S. side openly distorted the armistice agreement and nakedly stated that they would delay past January 22 next year in order to forcibly detain prisoners of war. Dean once said that the political conference could only discuss the prisoner of war issue if it met between December 22 and January 22 next year. He even stated that the political conference had nothing to do with the "release" of prisoners of war when the time "comes," and that the U.S. side's "release" of prisoners of war would be like a "timed safe," and no one could stop it. In order to achieve this goal, Dean used all kinds of delaying tactics and finally interrupted the talks, making it impossible for the political conference, which was tasked with resolving the prisoner of war issue, to be held. When Dean himself counter-accused the Korean and Chinese sides of not wanting to bring the prisoner of war issue to the political conference, he could not even justify himself, admitting that the U.S. side insisted on "releasing" prisoners of war when the time "comes," while "the Communists opposed this view." Obviously, the Korean and Chinese sides opposed the U.S. side's forcible detention of prisoners of war precisely in order to insist on resolving the prisoner of war issue through the political conference in accordance with the provisions of the armistice agreement.

    All the facts, which are known to the world and are supported by documents and records, prove that it is the U.S. side that is delaying time, undermining the political conference, and creating conditions for forcibly detaining prisoners of war; it is the U.S. side that refused to negotiate at Panmunjom with this conspiracy in mind and closed the door to talks single-handedly; it is the U.S. side that undermined the interpretation work stipulated in the "terms of reference," hindered the repatriation of prisoners of war, and conducted inhumane "psychological warfare" on the prisoner of war issue. With such a heavy record of disrepute, what way does the U.S. representative Dean have to realize his trick of stealing the sky and changing the day and reversing black and white in the eyes of the public?

### 美方扬言要劫夺战俘交给李蒋匪帮  完全暴露美方破坏朝鲜停战和破坏政治会议的阴谋

    美方扬言要劫夺战俘交给李蒋匪帮
    完全暴露美方破坏朝鲜停战和破坏政治会议的阴谋
   【新华社开城十七日电】本社特派记者报道：  一手中断双方会谈而把政治会议打入冷宫的迪安，已经完全暴露了美方破坏政治会议正是为了便于实现强迫扣留战俘的计划。在双方会谈中断的第二天，迪安就迫不及待地表明了美方要不顾一切扣留战俘的意图。十四日，迪安又紧接着宣布美方将布置军队以“保证”李承晚能够顺利地把战俘劫夺下来。在这些声明发表之后，美国军方立即加以响应，据合众社报道，在朝鲜的美国第八军军长泰勒十五日表示第八军正在“拟定计划”，以便在一九五四年一月二十三日以后来“收容”被劫离中立区的战俘。泰勒说，“第一步行动”是要把战俘“由汶山以北的中立区运走”，然后，“朝鲜俘虏将被交给南朝鲜政府，而中国战俘将被运到台湾的国民党中国去”。
    美方这样公然鼓励并且协助李承晚实现他强迫扣留战俘从而破坏朝鲜停战的阴谋，已使朝鲜停战的稳定遭到严重的威胁。
      但是，美方为了向全世界隐瞒朝鲜局势的严重性，并且为李承晚破坏朝鲜停战的行为预先推卸责任，目前正在玩弄他们最擅长的魔术师的手法，故意施放烟幕，以便欺骗世界舆论。迪安在完成其破坏双方会谈的预定计划返回华盛顿的途中，再度散布“乐观”空气。迪安十五日在东京对记者说，他
  “相信安排朝鲜和平会议的会谈将重新举行，虽然他不能预告在什么时候”。为了替美方所布置的指使李承晚强迫扣留战俘、破坏停战的业已列入日程的背信弃义行动打掩护，迪安故意表示他“深信”即使“和平会议不立即召开，南朝鲜总统李承晚也不会重新开始战争”。同时，李承晚奉命改变腔调，紧跟在迪安之后表示“他将给予朝鲜政治会议十足九十天的时间去解决朝鲜问题，不管会议在那一天开始举行。”迪安企图用这种貌若缓和实则仍然叫嚣战争的调子，来掩饰他强迫扣留战俘、破坏朝鲜停战的阴谋。迪安和李承晚玩弄这一套障眼法，其目的显然是为了蒙蔽那些追随美国的国家，以便一起把它们推落到深渊里去。
   【新华社开城十七日电】本社特派记者报道：完成了破坏双方会谈以便强迫扣留战俘的任务的迪安，目前在返回华盛顿途中正继续施展他在板门店一贯表现的颠倒是非、诽谤诬蔑、撒泼抵赖的才能，为美方破坏停战协定、强迫扣留战俘的行动推卸责任。
    迪安十五日在东京发表的声明中说：“共方在蓄意拖延预备会议，因为他们不敢使非遣返战俘的问题提到会议上来”。十六日，迪安又在下一个站头檀香山发表谈话说：“共方以拖延时间为其全部资本……共方一直利用谈判作为他们的宣传讲坛。这是他们心理战的全部。”迪安采取这种反咬一口的手法，徒然暴露了已无法招架朝中方面对美方破坏停战协定、扼杀政治会议、强迫扣留战俘的整套阴谋的无情揭露和躲避世界舆论的正义谴责。迪安由于逼得无路可走，竟异想天开地企图把朝中方面的指责倒转过来，以便逃脱美方的被告地位，迪安使用的这条诡计，他自己已经说得很清楚：“我们必须以他们的一套手段来对付他们。”
    但是迪安的这个拙劣的花招是迷糊不了人的。板门店双方会谈的记录证明：朝中方面一贯坚决反对美方蓄意阻挠政治会议的召开，企图拖过明年一月二十二日所谓战俘拘留期限以便强迫扣留战俘的阴谋，朝中方面坚持必须按照“职权范围”的规定，由政治会议来解决“未行使被遣返的权利之战俘的处理问题”。朝中方面在十一月三十日提出的全面建议中规定政治会议议程的第一项就是“战俘问题”，朝中代表并且指出：不论政治会议由于美方的阻挠而拖延到什么时候召开，政治会议都必须首先讨论并解决战俘问题。但是，与此相反，美方则公开曲解停战协定，赤裸裸地表明了他们要拖过明年一月二十二日以便强迫扣留战俘。迪安曾经说：政治会议只有在十二月二十二日到明年一月二十二日之间开会，才能讨论战俘问题。他甚至表示：政治会议与到“期”“释放”战俘一事无关，美方“释放”战俘一举将像“定时开启的保险库”一样，任何人都不能阻止。为了达到这一目的，迪安耍尽拖延手腕，最后中断会谈，使负有解决战俘问题使命的政治会议无法举行。迪安自己在反噬朝中方面不愿把战俘问题拿到政治会议上来的时候，甚至也不能自圆其说，他承认：美方坚持要到“期”
  “释放”战俘，而“共方反对这个意见”。显而易见，朝中方面反对美方强迫扣留战俘，正是要坚持按照停战协定的规定，通过政治会议来解决战俘问题。
    所有世人共知并有文件、记录为证的事实证明：拖延时间、破坏政治会议、为强迫扣留战俘制造条件的正是美方，怀着这一阴谋在板门店拒绝协商、一手关上会谈大门的正是美方，破坏“职权范围”所规定的解释工作，阻挠战俘遣返，在战俘问题上进行毫无人性的“心理战”的正是美方。背上了如此沉重的不名誉的记录的美国代表迪安，又有什么办法在众目睽睽之下实现他偷天换日、颠倒黑白的勾当呢？
