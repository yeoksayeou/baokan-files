    Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant's Blast Furnace Reconstruction Project Completed Ahead of Schedule
    Two More Blast Furnaces Successfully Produced Iron Last Month
    At 6:00 PM on November 24th, the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant's blast furnace reconstruction project was completed seven days ahead of schedule. With this, the iron and steel plant, which had been severely damaged by Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bandit gangs and shut down for more than eight years, has been successfully reconstructed according to advanced Soviet design concepts. Shanghai's steel and machinery manufacturing industries will be able to receive a steady supply of pig iron from here.
    The blast furnace reconstruction project has taken only six months from the official start of construction to completion. During the construction period, dozens of enterprises and units in more than a dozen cities across the country, including 36 machinery manufacturing plants, electrical companies, and cement companies, manufactured a large number of building materials and machines to meet the needs of the Ma'anshan reconstruction project. Among them, the amount of refractory bricks alone reached 10,000 tons. During the construction period, workers, technicians, and farmers from dozens of cities such as Taiyuan, Benxi, Tianjin, Hefei, Wuhu, and Bengbu overcame various difficulties here and finally successfully completed the task. The fact that the blast furnace reconstruction project was completed ahead of schedule fully demonstrates the high enthusiasm and strength of the Chinese people for realizing national industrialization.
    Following the iron production from blast furnaces No. 1 and No. 2, blast furnace No. 3 began producing iron on November 20th, and blast furnace No. 4 successfully poured its first batch of molten iron at 7:00 AM on November 26th. Currently, the production preparation work for blast furnaces No. 5 and No. 6 is underway. Iron-making raw materials such as ore, limestone, and manganese ore transported from Taochong, Gushan, and Qixia Mountain have already arrived, and mud guns, chisels, and protective equipment needed for production are fully prepared. The production workers, wearing blue overalls and large-brimmed hats, walked to their production posts with great joy, welcoming the joyous day when all the blast furnaces will be producing iron.

    马鞍山铁厂炼铁炉改建工程提前完成
    上月份又有两个高炉胜利出铁
    十一月二十四日下午六时，马鞍山铁厂炼铁炉改建工程提前七天全部完工。至此，这座曾遭日寇及国民党匪帮严重破坏并停火八年多的铁厂，已经按照苏联先进设计思想改建成功。上海市炼钢及机器制造业，将可以从这里得到源源不断的生铁供应。
    炼铁炉改建工程，从正式施工到现在只有六个月。在施工期间里，全国十几个城市三十六个机器制造厂、电器公司、水泥公司等企业单位，承制了大批建筑器材和机器，供应马鞍山改建工程的需要。其中光耐火砖就达一万吨。施工期间，有来自太原、本溪、天津、合肥、芜湖、蚌埠等数十个城市的工人、技术人员，以及马鞍山附近的农民，他们在这里克服了种种困难，终于胜利地完成了任务。炼铁炉改建工程提早完工的事实，充分显示了我国人民为实现国家工业化的高度热情和力量。
    该厂继一、二号高炉出铁之后，三号高炉于十一月二十日开始出铁，四号高炉又于十一月二十六日上午七时胜利地吐出了第一炉铁水。现在，五、六号两座高炉的生产准备工作正紧张进行。从桃冲、姑山、栖霞山等地运来的矿石、石灰石、锰矿等炼铁原料早已到达，生产时所需要的泥炮、钎子和防护用品已准备齐全。生产工人穿着蓝色工作服，戴着大盘帽子，兴高采烈地走上生产岗位，迎接全部炼铁炉出铁的喜日来临。
