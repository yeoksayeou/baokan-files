Northeast China's state-owned cotton textile mills, cotton mills, and secondary-level department store wholesale stations recently held a joint materials supply conference in Shenyang, under the auspices of the Northeast Supply and Sales Branch of the Central Ministry of Textile Industry and the Northeast China Company of the China Department Store Company. At the meeting, appropriate arrangements were made for the supply, production, and sales tasks among the various departments for the first quarter of next year.

This conference first focused on discussing the integration of plans and the alignment of figures between the relevant units. It determined the quantity of raw cotton to be supplied by the cotton mills within the region to the state-owned cotton textile mills in the first quarter of next year; the quantity of cotton cloth and cotton yarn to be supplied by the cotton textile mills to the department store wholesale stations; and the quantity of linen to be supplied by China's first automated flax mill—Harbin Flax Mill—to department store departments in various regions. The determination of these figures was the result of careful discussion and research to ensure the rational use of materials in the context of large-scale national economic construction. In determining the specifications of raw cotton to be allocated by cotton mills in Northeast China to yarn mills, the conference made five or six revisions, taking into account the conditions of each unit, and finally achieved a reasonable allocation that satisfied both parties.

The conference also made preparations for the cotton wadding needed by the masses next year. In the first quarter of next year, cotton mills in various parts of Northeast China will begin allocating cotton wadding to department store wholesale stations in various regions, so that supply departments in various regions can process and supply it year-round.

In addition, the conference also conducted appropriate research on private garment and dyeing industries. It was determined that appropriate arrangements should first be made within the province and city regions. If the dyeing and weaving capacity is still insufficient or surplus, the Shenyang Department Store Central Station will take unified control. However, when organizing private processing, various regions should help them improve product quality, reduce costs, and strengthen their leadership and education, in order to adapt to the state's transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises during the transition period.

    东北各国营棉纺织厂棉花厂与百货批发站举行供应会议
    安排明年第一季度供应、生产和销售工作
    东北各地国营棉纺织厂、棉花厂及二级百货批发站，在中央纺织工业部东北供销分局与中国百货公司东北区公司主持下，最近在沈阳联合召开了物资供应会议。会上对明年第一季度各部门间的供、产、销各方面任务，做了妥善安排。
    这次大会首先着重讨论了各有关单位，彼此之间的计划结合与数字衔接。确定了明年第一季度棉花厂供应区内国营棉纺织厂原棉的数量；棉纺织厂供应百货批发站棉布和棉纱的数量；以及中国第一个自动化亚麻厂——哈尔滨亚麻厂供给各地百货部门亚麻布的数量。这些数字的确定，是经过仔细的讨论与研究，以便做到在国家大规模经济建设的情况下，使物资合理使用。在确定东北各地棉花厂调拨给纱厂的原棉规格上，会议曾经做了五、六次的修改，相互照顾了各单位的条件，最后才做到合理调拨，使双方满意。
    会议还对明年群众所需絮棉做了准备。明年第一季度东北各地棉花厂，即将开始给各地百货批发站调拨絮棉，以便各地供应部门常年加工和供应。
    此外会议对私人加织加染工业，也做了适当研究。确定首先在各省市本区内做适当安排。如染织能力仍有不足或剩余时，再由沈阳百货中央站统一掌握。但各地组织私人加工时，应该帮助他们改进产品质量，降低成本，加强对他们的领导与教育，以适合于国家在过渡时期对私人工商业的改造工作。　（林笑飞）
