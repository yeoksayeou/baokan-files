Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 3rd: On the seventeenth day of the Korean-Chinese side's explanatory work being continuously interrupted by U.S. special agent obstruction, two more Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war and two Korean People's Army prisoners of war risked their lives to escape the camp and return, once again exposing the U.S. side's so-called nonsense of prisoners of war "preferring death to repatriation."

The Korean-Chinese prisoners of war who returned today revealed that the U.S. side is directing special agents in the Dongchang-ri prisoner of war camp to intensify coercion of prisoners of war and prevent repatriation by using methods such as tattooing and blood-stained flags, and is making various arrangements to kidnap and detain prisoners of war.

Liu Zegao, a returning prisoner of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, had already been tattooed with words insulting the motherland and the flags of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits on his back, chest, and arms by special agents. Recently, special agents forced him to tattoo his stomach. After the explanatory work was suspended, because he showed anxiety, the special agent "battalion commander" said he was "ideologically unstable" and ordered several special agents to hold him to the ground and use three or four steel needles twisted together to tattoo characters the size of teacups one by one on his belly. He said that many other prisoners of war were also forced to be tattooed again, and those that had faded were re-tattooed. The "battalion commander" told the prisoners of war: "Regardless of whether there is explanation or not, with your bodies covered in tattoos, let's see if you still dare to return to the mainland!"

Liu Zegao also revealed the atrocities of Chiang Kai-shek's special agents forcing prisoners of war to cut their fingers to dye Chiang Kai-shek's flags with blood. He stretched out his hands full of scars in front of the neutral nations personnel and said that the special agents forced them to use their own blood to dye a foot-long "Wang Ba flag." He cut each of his ten fingers three or four times. Many prisoners of war were pale as if they had suffered a serious illness because they lost too much blood.

Another returning Volunteer Army personnel, Zhao Puquan, added that in addition to forcing tattoos and dyeing blood flags to increase prisoners of war's fear of returning home, the special agents had also increased the number of sentries to monitor prisoners of war. The number of "security guards" on duty at the twentyth camp where Zhao Puquan was stationed had increased from four to fourteen per shift. He himself relied on his identity as a "security guard" to take advantage of the opportunity to be on duty in the middle of the night to climb over the barbed wire and run away.

Liu Zegao and Zhao Puquan both said that since the recent suspension of explanation, the special agents had ordered everyone to make a Chiang Kai-shek military cap and a pair of shoes. The special agents said that Taiwan had already transported cotton clothes, and that they should make their own hats and shoes so that they could be properly dressed when the U.S. military forcibly sent the prisoners of war to Taiwan in the future. Recently, the special agents also inspected each prisoner of war's luggage and conducted a packing drill.

People's Army returnees Wei Zhengfan and Wu Dongye both decided to risk their lives to climb the barbed wire and escape because they heard the special agents say that they would no longer listen to explanations. They said that the special agents were creating an atmosphere of forcing prisoners of war to go to South Korea. A special agent leader in the thirty-eighth camp told the prisoners of war that Dulles had guaranteed that the U.S. military would hand over the prisoners of war to Syngman Rhee on January 22nd next year, and that Syngman Rhee had prepared sanatoriums for the prisoners of war in Masan, and prepared jobs for the prisoners of war in Seoul and Busan, etc. However, the special agents were very worried that the prisoners of war would escape, so they newly designated an "informant" in each tent to monitor the prisoners of war's thoughts and actions. Prisoners of war who slightly revealed their desire for repatriation would be severely beaten by the special agents. Wei Zhengfan injured his foot when he climbed the barbed wire. He was still limping when he returned to Panmunjom today. At midnight on November 30th, he injured himself when he climbed over the first barbed wire, but because he was too nervous at the time, he did not feel the pain until he climbed over four layers of barbed wire and realized that his shin was swollen very high.

To date, 274 Korean-Chinese prisoners of war have risked their lives to break through special agent control and return. Since the explanatory work was interrupted on the 17th of last month, 19 people have escaped one after another to request repatriation.

### 三日我方被俘人员四名遣返归来后揭露  美方加紧指挥特务阴谋劫持和扣留战俘

    三日我方被俘人员四名遣返归来后揭露
    美方加紧指挥特务阴谋劫持和扣留战俘
    【新华社开城三日电】在朝中方面的解释工作因美方特务阻挠而连续中断的第十七天，又有两名中国人民志愿军被俘人员和两名朝鲜人民军被俘人员冒着生命危险逃出营场遣返归来，这使美方所谓战俘“宁死不愿遣返”的鬼话再一次原形暴露。
    今天遣返归来的朝中被俘人员揭露：美方正在指挥东场里战俘营中的特务利用刺字、染血旗等等办法来加紧胁迫战俘、阻止遣返，并进行种种布置，以劫持和扣留战俘。
    归来的志愿军被俘人员刘择高的背上、胸上、手臂上早被特务刺上侮辱祖国的字句和蒋匪的旗子，最近特务又强迫在他肚子上刺字。他在解释工作停顿后，因为流露出焦虑情绪，特务“大队长”说他“思想不稳”，就命令几个特务把他按在地上，把三四根钢针缠在一起，然后在他肚皮上刺了一个一个像茶盅大的字。他说，还有不少战俘也被强迫再次刺了字，从前刺了褪了色的就重新补刺。“大队长”对战俘说：“不管解释不解释，刺了满身的字，看你还敢回大陆！”
    刘择高也揭露了蒋匪特务强迫战俘割破手指染制蒋匪旗帜的暴行。他在中立国人员面前伸出满是疤痕的双手说，特务们强迫他们用自己的血染一面一尺多长的“王八旗”，他十个手指每个都割了三四刀，许多战俘因为流血太多，脸色惨白，好像害了一场大病。
    另一名志愿军归来人员赵普权补充说，特务们最近除了强迫刺字、染血旗以增加战俘回国的疑惧外，并加派岗哨监视战俘。赵普权所在的二十号营场站岗的“警备队员”，每班由四人增加到十四人。他本人是靠了“警备队员”的身分，趁着半夜里站岗的机会翻铁丝网跑出来的。
    刘择高和赵普权都说，自从最近解释停顿后，特务们即下令要每人自做一顶蒋匪军帽和一双鞋子。特务们说，台湾已经把棉衣运来了，自己做帽子和鞋，以便将来美军把战俘强行送往台湾时穿戴整齐。最近，特务们并检查了每个战俘的行装，做了一次打背包的演习。
    人民军归来人员卫正番和吴东叶都因为听到特务说不再听解释了，便决心冒死爬铁丝网逃出来。他们说，特务正在制造强迫战俘到南朝鲜去的空气。三十八号营场的一个特务头子对战俘说，杜勒斯已经保证美军在明年一月二十二日把战俘交给李承晚，李承晚已经在马山给战俘准备好了疗养院，在汉城和釜山给战俘准备好职业等等。可是，特务们非常担心战俘会逃跑，因此在每个帐篷中新指定了一个“情报员”，监视战俘的思想行动，稍微透露遣返愿望的战俘就会被特务毒打。卫正番在翻铁丝网时跌伤了脚，今天回到板门店时还是一拐一拐的。十一月三十日半夜，当他翻第一道铁丝网时便跌伤了，但因为当时精神太紧张，没有感到疼痛，直到翻出四层铁丝网才知道脚胫已肿起很高。
    到今天为止，冒着生命危险突破特务控制归来的朝中战俘已有二百七十四人。自上月十七日解释工作中断以来，先后有十九人逃出来要求遣返。
