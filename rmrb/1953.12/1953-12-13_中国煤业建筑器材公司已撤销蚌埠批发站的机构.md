Response to Criticisms and Suggestions from Readers of the People's Daily

    China Coal Industry Construction Materials Company has revoked the organization of the Bengbu Wholesale Station.
    Letter from China Coal Industry Construction Materials Company: The criticism made by reader Du Shaoming in the "Reader's Letters Summary" column on October 17th regarding the overstaffing of our company's Bengbu Wholesale Station is correct. When establishing the Bengbu Wholesale Station, we did not adequately estimate the situation beforehand, and subsequently lacked thorough inspection. Although the station reflected the low workload and overstaffing situation several times and proposed reorganization suggestions, this issue involved a wide range of aspects, and coupled with our insufficient subjective efforts, it was not resolved in a timely manner, resulting in the long-term existence of overstaffing at the station. This not only affected the morale of the cadres but also caused waste to the country. In order to solve this problem, we submitted a request to the higher authorities in September and revoked the station in October after approval.

    中国煤业建筑器材公司已撤销蚌埠批发站的机构
    中国煤业建筑器材公司来信：十月十七日“读者来信摘要”栏所刊读者杜绍明对我公司蚌埠批发站人浮于事的批评是正确的。在设置蚌埠批发站时，我们事先对情况估计不足，事后又缺乏深入检查。该站虽然数次反映工作少、人员多的情况，并提出改组意见；但由于这一问题牵涉面较广，以及我们主观上努力不够，没有及时解决，而使该站人浮于事现象长期存在。这不但影响了干部情绪，而且给国家造成了浪费。为了解决这一问题，我们已于九月份呈请上级批准后，于十月份将该站撤销。
