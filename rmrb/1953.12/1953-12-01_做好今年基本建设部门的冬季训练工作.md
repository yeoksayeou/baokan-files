    Do a Good Job in This Year's Winter Training for Basic Construction Departments

    Winter is coming. Except for areas where winter operations and indoor installation projects can be carried out, this year's basic construction work in most parts of the country has ended or is about to end. The new task facing the basic construction departments is to use the winter slack season to conduct political, technical, and professional training for basic-level management personnel, engineering technicians and workers, and Party and mass work cadres, according to their different situations, in order to prepare for next year's basic construction.

    Next year's basic construction tasks will be heavier and the engineering technical requirements will be more complex than this year. Although our basic construction departments have been greatly tempered in the past few years of construction, and have completed complex projects such as seamless steel pipe plants and large rolling mills, and have accumulated a lot of experience, compared with the engineering tasks in the future, the strength of our basic construction team is still very weak. For example, although the number of existing basic construction workers is not small, the various types of work and skills are not balanced: there is a surplus of civil engineering workers, but a shortage of special technical workers; there are more workers with poor skills and fewer workers with good skills; this year, some units have also absorbed a large number of new workers, whose political awareness and technical level are still far behind the objective needs. At the same time, the leadership of many basic construction departments is still weak, resulting in poor quality of some projects this year, and rework and waste accidents continue to occur. Therefore, in order to shoulder the heavier construction tasks next year, it is absolutely necessary to summarize the experience of basic construction work in the past year through this year's winter training, so as to improve the level of the existing basic construction team.

    Based on the requirements of the existing basic construction strength and next year's basic construction tasks, we no longer need to expand the number of permanent workers, and we should rectify and consolidate the existing basic construction team, and improve the political and technical level of workers and technical personnel in the process of rectification and consolidation. Therefore, except for those who are not suitable for working in basic construction departments and whose personnel are not needed for basic construction work, and who should be properly arranged for transfer or return to their hometowns for production, the workers, technical personnel, and management personnel in basic construction departments who are fixed according to the needs of the tasks should be organized and planned to conduct a winter training. The specific plan for winter training should be determined according to the problems that occurred in this year's construction and the needs of next year's basic construction tasks, according to different situations.

    What are the problems in this year's basic construction? The most prominent are two: one is that the management level of basic-level cadres is not high; the other is that the technical level of workers is low. Therefore, the construction management site of many basic construction departments this year is chaotic, and quality accidents continue to occur. The reason why the management level of basic-level cadres is not high is that most of the basic-level cadres in basic construction departments are newly transferred from rural areas and other positions this year, some are promoted from workers, and a few are retained and recruited. Most of them are very enthusiastic, but they are extremely unfamiliar with today's complex basic construction business, and do not understand what should be done and what should not be done. Some cadres also do not have a sufficient understanding of the great significance of basic construction, and lack the idea of serving basic construction for a long time. As a result, engineering management and political work cannot keep up with the needs of the development of the construction industry. With the increasing development of the country's construction industry in the future, the complexity of engineering will increase, and the requirements for business management will become more and more strict. The improvement of the business and policy level of basic construction basic-level management cadres and Party and mass work cadres is particularly important. Therefore, in this year's winter training, we should first strengthen the training of basic-level cadres, which is a decisive key to improving next year's construction management and ensuring the normal operation of work.

    The content of basic-level cadre training should, on the one hand, study the general line and general tasks of our country during the transition period and the relevant policies and guidelines for basic construction, so that they can understand the long-term vision of national construction and clarify their work direction. On the other hand, they should summarize this year's work according to various different businesses (such as construction management, technology, finance, technical security, labor wages, welfare, political work, etc.), and pay special attention to summarizing the advanced experience in construction management and the responsibility system, so that they can know how to lead basic construction work through their own personal experience. At the same time, in conjunction with the summary of work, they should also be given some basic business knowledge education. When training basic-level cadres, we can also absorb a group of advanced workers' team leaders and promising active workers to participate, and boldly promote them to enrich the ranks of basic-level cadres.

    Secondly, according to the low technical level of construction workers this year, the winter training this year must strengthen the technical education of workers. Because the characteristics of next year's basic construction work are: the number of factory buildings will increase, the number of installation projects will increase, and the degree of mechanized construction will gradually increase. If we do not make technical preparations early by using winter training, we will inevitably be unable to complete next year's tasks. The technical training for this year's winter training should be conducted separately according to different types of work such as civil engineering, metal structure, mechanical and electrical installation, construction machinery, and engineering geological drilling, to learn basic technical knowledge (such as reading drawings), and summarize the relevant advanced technical experience separately. In the winter training, each engineering unit should, according to next year's tasks, adopt the form of running specialized technical training classes, and plan to train a sufficient number of special technical workers (such as welders, scaffolders, plumbing workers, etc.) and mechanized construction forces that are necessary for next year's construction. In addition, according to the experience of some regions, in the winter training this year, according to the needs and possibilities, some workers of the same type of work can also be organized to learn a "second profession" (such as bricklayers can learn plastering, caulking, etc.) on the basis of actually learning the technology of their own industry, so that these workers can master a variety of technologies. Doing so can reduce the large amount of wasted work losses caused by the priority of construction procedures every year, and can ensure that workers have relative stability, overcome the phenomenon of excessive mobility of construction workers, and create favorable conditions for strengthening construction management. In short, in winter training, we must use the main time and effort to improve technology and learn advanced experience, so as to achieve a considerable increase in the proportion of technical workers in the basic construction team, and the technical level will also be generally improved.

    Taking technical learning as the focus does not mean that political learning can be cancelled. On the contrary, political learning should still become an indispensable and important part of this year's winter training. Especially in some newly established basic construction departments and among some workers (such as civil engineering workers, etc.), political learning should become the main content of their winter training. In other departments, it is also necessary to ensure that there is a certain amount of time for political learning, and it can be carried out in coordination with technical education. The content of this year's winter training political education should be to publicize the general line of our country during the transition period to the workers, explain the important role of the basic construction department in the country's socialist industrialization, explain the responsibility of the working class in the country's industrialization, and some principles of basic construction operation and management, such as establishing and strengthening the responsibility system, strengthening construction plan management, consolidating labor discipline, promoting advanced experience, improving the quality of basic construction projects, and establishing the idea of comprehensively completing the basic construction plan with "good, fast, economical, and safe." At the same time, we can also combine the work of building the Party, building the League, and developing trade union organizations. In some newly established or considerably impure basic construction departments, on the basis of political education, it is also necessary to carry out appropriate rectification of the team to ensure the purity of the basic construction team.

    Engineering technicians in basic construction departments should also be organized to conduct a study in winter. With the increasing technical complexity of construction projects in the future, improving the ideological level and business ability of engineering technicians is also an urgent task today. The winter training of engineering technicians should mainly take the form of summarizing work, affirming achievements, criticizing mistakes, establishing the idea and style of learning from the advanced technical experience of the Soviet Union, learning from the combination of theory and practice, and the combination of science and technology and labor experience, and strengthening the unity of new and old technical personnel. All key engineering units whose construction drawings have been translated for next year should organize engineering technicians to study the drawings well. This is the most practical and effective professional training.

    The key to doing a good job in winter training is to strengthen leadership and make full preparations. The winter training in various places should be directly presided over by the responsible cadres of the basic construction department, and should be carried out in engineering companies, without disrupting the original establishment, but the local Party committee must unify planning and leadership. It is necessary to improve the organizational structure of the training class and equip it with competent cadres, strive to prepare winter training materials as soon as possible, and do a good job in the living welfare work such as food, accommodation, cultural entertainment, medical and health care for the trainees. Once the project is over, organize cadres and trained workers to enter the winter training quickly and in an orderly manner.

    The characteristics of this year's winter training are that there are a large number of people, and the training objects and contents are more complicated, and the tasks are very heavy. Now the time is very tight. The central industrial departments and many units in Northeast China are actively preparing for winter training. Other units and regions that have not yet started must act quickly.

### 做好今年基本建设部门的冬季训练工作

    做好今年基本建设部门的冬季训练工作
    冬天来了。全国除在可以进行冬季作业及室内的安装工程外，大部分地区今年的基本建设工作已经结束或即将结束。摆在基本建设部门面前的新任务，是利用冬闲，对基本建设的基层管理人员、工程技术人员和工人、党群工作干部，分别不同情况，进行一次政治、技术和业务的训练，为明年的基本建设作好准备工作。
    明年的基本建设任务比今年更加繁重，工程技术要求也比今年更为复杂。我们的基本建设部门，在过去几年的施工中虽然受到了很大的锻炼，已经完成了像无缝钢管厂、大型轧钢厂那样复杂的工程，取得了不少的经验，但和今后的工程任务比较起来，我们基本建设队伍的力量还很薄弱。例如我们现有基本建设工人的数量虽然不小，但各工种和技术却不平衡：土木工人有多余，特种技术工人则不足；技术差的工人多，技术好的工人少；今年有些单位又吸收了大批新工人，他们的政治觉悟和技术水平都还远远落后于客观的需要。同时许多基本建设部门的领导也还薄弱，以致今年某些工程质量不好，返工浪费的事故不断发生。因此，要担负起明年更加繁重的建设任务，通过今年的冬训，以便把一年来基本建设施工的经验加以总结，把现有基本建设队伍的水平提高一步，这是完全必要的。
    根据现有基本建设力量和明年基本建设任务的要求，我们已不再需要扩大固定工人的数量，而且应对现有的基本建设队伍进行整顿和巩固，在整顿和巩固现有队伍中来提高工人及技术人员的政治水平和技术水平。因此，除那些不适合在基本建设部门工作及基本建设工作不需要的人员，要妥善安置其转业或回乡生产外，对根据任务需要而固定下来的工人、技术人员和基本建设部门中的管理人员，要有组织有计划地进行一次冬训。冬训具体计划的安排，应该根据今年施工中发生的问题和明年基本建设任务的需要，分别不同情况，来加以确定。
    今年基本建设施工中有些什么问题呢，最突出的有两个，一是基层干部的管理水平不高；二是工人技术水平低。因此今年不少基本建设部门施工管理现场混乱，质量事故不断发生。基层干部管理水平之所以不高，这是因为基本建设部门的基层干部，多数是今年新从农村和其他岗位调来的，有些是从工人中提拔的，也有少数是留用和招雇的。他们大多数热情很高，可是对于今天复杂的基本建设业务却极不熟悉，不懂得那些事应该作，那些事不应该作。也有些干部对基本建设的重大意义还认识不足，缺乏长期为基本建设服务的思想。结果，就使得工程管理和政治工作赶不上建设事业发展的需要。随着今后国家建设事业的日益发展，工程的复杂性愈益增大，经营管理方面的要求愈益严格，基本建设基层管理干部和党群工作干部的业务和政策水平的提高，就显得特别重要。因此，在今年冬训中，首先就应该加强对基层干部的训练，这是改善明年施工管理、保证工作正常进行的决定关键。
    基层干部训练的内容，一方面应该学习我国在过渡时期的总路线总任务和有关基本建设的政策方针，使他们认清国家建设的远景，明确他们的工作方向，另一方面应按各种不同业务，分别的来总结今年的工作（如施工管理、技术、财务、技术保安、劳动工资、福利、政治工作等），特别要注意总结施工管理和责任制方面的先进经验，使他们通过自己切身的体验，知道应该如何领导基本建设工作。同时结合着总结工作，还应该给他们进行一些基本业务知识的教育。在训练基层干部时，还可以吸收一批先进工人小组的小组长和有培养前途的积极工人参加，并放手提拔他们充实基层干部的队伍。
    其次，根据今年建筑工人技术水平低的情况，今年的冬训必须加强工人的技术教育。因为明年基本建设施工的特点是：厂房建筑增多，安装工程增多，机械化施工程度逐步提高，我们如果不利用冬训在技术上早作准备，势必不能胜任明年的任务。今年冬训的技术训练应该分别按土建工程、金属结构、机电安装、施工机械、工程地质钻探等不同工种，进行基本技术知识（如看图纸）的学习，并分别总结有关的技术先进经验。各工程单位在冬训中应根据明年的任务，采取办专门技术训练班的形式，有计划地培养一批为明年施工所必需的足够数量的特种技术工人（如电焊工、架子工、水暖工等）和机械化施工的力量。另外，根据某些地区的经验，在今年冬训中，根据需要与可能，某些同工种的工人在切实学好了本行技术的基础上，还可以组织起来学习“第二种职业”，（如瓦工可以学习抹灰、勾缝等）使得这些工人可以掌握多种技术。这样做可以减少每年由于施工程序有先有后所造成的大量窝工损失，并可保证工人有相对的固定性，克服建筑工人过于流动的现象，为加强施工管理创造有利条件。总之，在冬训中我们必须把主要的时间与力量，用来提高技术，学习先进经验，以达到基本建设队伍中技术工人的比重有相当的增加，技术水平也普遍提高一步。
    以技术学习为重点，并不意味着可以取消政治学习，相反，政治学习仍然应该成为今年冬训中绝不可缺的重要部分。特别是在一些今年新成立的基本建设部门中和一部分工人中（如土木工人等），政治学习应该成为他们冬训中的主要内容。在其他部门中，也必须保证有一定数量的政治学习的时间，并可和技术教育配合起来进行。今年冬训政治教育的内容，应该是向工人宣传我国过渡时期的总路线，说明基本建设部门在国家社会主义工业化事业中的重大作用，说明工人阶级在国家工业化事业中的责任，以及基本建设经营管理方面的一些原则问题，如建立和加强责任制，加强施工计划管理，巩固劳动纪律，推广先进经验，提高基本建设的工程质量，树立“好、快、省、安全”全面完成基本建设计划的思想等等。同时还可结合进行建党、建团和发展工会组织的工作。在一些新成立的或成份相当不纯的基本建设部门中，在政治教育的基础上，还需要进行适当的整顿队伍的工作，确保基本建设队伍的纯洁性。
    基本建设部门的工程技术人员，也应该在冬季组织起来进行一次学习。随着今后建设工程技术复杂性的日益增加，提高工程技术人员的思想水平和业务能力，同样是今天迫切的任务。工程技术人员的冬训主要应采取总结工作的方式，从总结工作中来肯定成绩，批判错误，树立学习苏联先进技术经验、学习理论和实际相结合、科学技术与劳动经验相结合的思想和作风，加强新旧技术人员的团结。凡是明年施工图纸已经译出的重点工程单位，就应很好的组织工程技术人员一起来学习图纸，这是最实际有效的业务训练。
    做好冬训的关键是加强领导和作好充分的准备工作。各地的冬训应由基本建设部门的负责干部直接主持，以工程公司为单位进行，不要打乱原来的建制，但当地党委必须统一计划与领导。要健全训练班的组织机构和配备能胜任的干部，争取早日编好冬训教材，作好受训工人的食宿、文化娱乐、医药卫生等生活福利工作，一旦工程结束后，就组织干部和参加受训的工人，迅速地有秩序地进入冬训。
    今年冬训的特点是人数较多，训练对象和内容也较复杂，任务是很繁重的。现在时间已很紧迫，中央各工业部门和东北地区许多单位，已在积极进行冬训的准备工作，其他还没有进行的单位和地区，必须迅速地行动起来。
