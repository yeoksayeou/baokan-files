Peasants in Various Regions of the Southwest Actively Sell Surplus Grain

[Our Newspaper News] The large-scale propaganda of the General Line to farmers in various regions of the Southwest has promoted the extensive development of grain purchase work. In mid-November, the region's grain procurement volume increased by 22% compared to the same period in October. The grain procurement volume in the Jiangjin Special District of Sichuan Province more than doubled, and the procurement volume in the Wenjiang Special District exceeded four times that of the first ten days of the month in three days. Grain purchase volume in Guizhou Province increased by 25%, and Yunnan Province purchased an average of 2.8 million jin of rice per day.

At the beginning of November, various regions in the Southwest successively convened expanded meetings of county, district, and township level cadres and people's representatives meetings to publicize the general line of the state's transition period to the vast number of cadres and the masses. After recognizing the significance of grain purchase work for supporting national industrial construction, stabilizing prices, and promoting the socialist transformation of agriculture, many rural cadres took the lead in mobilizing the peasant masses to sell their surplus grain to the state. In the eighth district of Cangxi County, Sichuan Province, at a cadres meeting, 60 village cadres took the lead in selling 19,000 jin of yellow rice. Under the leadership of township cadres in Nanlong Township, Nanbu County, farmers in the whole township sold 400,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. When the mutual aid group in Danan Township, Yongchuan County, discussed grain sales, they realized the benefits of national industrialization for farmers from the fact that chemical fertilizers, pesticides, sprayers, and cheap daily necessities could be bought after the completion of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. They knew that supporting industrial construction was also supporting agricultural production, and 23 mutual aid groups immediately decided to sell 25,700 jin of surplus grain. When publicizing the general line, counties in Yiliang, Qujing, Mengzi, Yuxi and other special districts in Yunnan Province and Bijie County in Guizhou Province, Tianquan and Xichang counties in Xikang Province, first had cadres make reports to the masses at large and small meetings, and then combined with local specific examples, used methods such as recollection, comparison, and detailed accounting to launch discussions to educate farmers to understand the spirit of the general line and the significance of grain sales. After publicity in Huajiao Township, Qujing County, Yunnan Province, farmers enthusiastically sold 300,000 jin of grain. In Changning County, a bundle of yarn used to sell for 420,000 yuan last year, but now it only costs 250,000 yuan. A bolt of cloth used to cost two baskets of grain last year, but this year it only costs one basket of grain. After comparing these facts, farmers in Shiwu, Longquan, and other townships in the county, who were originally afraid of rising prices, quickly dispelled their concerns, and the three townships sold 720,000 jin of grain in one week.

    西南区各地农民积极出售余粮
    【本报讯】西南区各地大规模向农民宣传总路线，推动了购粮工作的广泛展开。十一月中旬，全区粮食收购量比十月份同期增加百分之二十二，四川省江津专区粮食收购量增加一倍多，温江专区三天中的收购量就超过上旬四倍，贵州省购粮量增加百分之二十五，云南全省平均每天购进大米二百八十万斤。
    十一月初，西南区各地相继召开县、区、乡三级干部扩大会议和人民代表会议，向广大干部和群众宣传国家过渡时期的总路线。许多乡村干部在认识粮食收购工作对支援国家工业建设、稳定物价和对促进农业社会主义改造的意义后，纷纷带动农民群众把余粮卖给国家。四川省苍溪县第八区在一次干部会上，就有六十个乡村干部带头卖出一万九千斤黄谷；南部县南隆乡在乡干部带动下，全乡农民卖给国家四十万斤余粮。永川县大南乡互助组讨论售粮时，从成渝铁路修成后能买到化学肥料、杀虫药、喷雾器和便宜的日用品的事实中，认识到国家工业化对农民的好处，知道支援工业建设也就是支持农业生产，二十三个互助组当场就决定出售余粮二万五千七百斤。云南省宜良、曲靖、蒙自、玉溪等专区各县和贵州省毕节县，西康省天全、西昌等县，在宣传总路线时，先由干部在大小会上向群众作报告，然后结合当地具体事例，用回忆、对比、算细账等方法展开讨论，教育农民领会总路线的精神和售粮的意义。云南曲靖县花椒乡经过宣传，农民踊跃售粮三十万斤。昌宁县去年一捆纱要卖四十二万元，现在只要二十五万元，一匹布去年需两箩谷，今年只要一箩谷，该县石文、龙泉等乡农民将这些事实对比之后，原来怕物价涨的农民，很快消除了顾虑，三个乡一个星期就售粮七十二万斤。
