During the Spring Festival of 1954, the cultural departments of governments at all levels should organize film projection teams, theater troupes, cultural centers, stations, and other cultural institutions, as well as mass amateur cultural and artistic organizations (such as rural clubs, rural theater troupes, etc.) to widely carry out mass cultural activities in rural areas and market towns in a planned way, to publicize the general line of the state during the transition period, to strengthen socialist education for the broad masses of farmers, and to meet the masses' demands for Spring Festival cultural life. For this purpose, the following instructions are issued:

I. In terms of publicity content, based on the relevant editorials of the People's Daily and the articles "Publicizing the General Line to Farmers" continuously published in the newspaper, and in combination with local conditions, the following points should be emphasized: (1) Publicizing the general line of the transition period, inspiring the people with the great goal of national socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization, and explaining that this is the only way to promote national prosperity and thoroughly improve the people's lives; (2) Publicizing the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement and the benefits of mutual aid and cooperation, explaining that only in this way can farmers get rid of capitalist exploitation and poverty and live a life of common prosperity; (3) Publicizing the expansion of production investment, making good preparations for spring plowing, improving technology, and striving for increased agricultural crop production next year; (4) Publicizing the great significance of enthusiastically selling grain to the state to support national construction; (5) Publicizing the achievements of the state in industrial, transportation, water conservancy, and other constructions and their tremendous help to rural areas, praising the labor achievements and fighting spirit of the working class, and strengthening the idea of further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance; (6) Introducing the socialist construction and happy life of the Soviet Union, and learning from the past arduous struggle of the Soviet people to realize national industrialization and agricultural collectivization. In addition, the publicity of the Marriage Law should continue to be implemented, as well as the publicity of the nationwide general election movement currently underway.

II. Cultural departments at all levels should immediately organize literary and art workers to create works of various themes and forms in accordance with the above spirit, based on their different life experiences and artistic expertise, and truthfully depict new deeds, new characters, and new ideas in the process of national socialist industrialization and socialist transformation, as well as the struggle between advanced and backward things. The general line should be expressed from various different life perspectives, and it should not be forced to require that all aspects of the general line be expressed in each work. The form should strive to be diversified. In addition to movies, dramas, and slides, the original folk operas (including various local operas, puppet shows, shadow plays, etc.), folk art forms, acrobatics, and other healthy cultural and entertainment programs can be performed. Do not rigidly add the content of publicizing the general line to these programs. Popular speeches about the general line can be made before and after the performance or during the intermission, in connection with the actual situation of the local area.

III. It is stipulated that film projection teams should screen the following films during the Spring Festival: Feature films "Harvest" and "When the Grapes are Ripe"; documentaries "The Great Land Reform," "Resist America, Aid Korea, Series II," "Spark Collective Farm," "Production Cooperative," "National Day of 1953," "Industrial Production," "Water Conservancy Construction," "Folk Songs and Dances"; translated Soviet films "Chinese Farmers Delegation Visits the Soviet Union," "Light Shines on the Highland Village" (original name "Light Shines on Keordi Village"), "The Road to Collectivization" (original name "Virgin Soil Upturned"). China Film Distribution Company should immediately prepare the supply of copies and publicity materials for the above films and make film scheduling and circulation plans. China Film Equipment Company and repair stations and projection teams in various places should immediately prepare equipment, supply, and maintenance of projection machines. Projection teams in various places should conduct necessary and appropriate oral explanations and publicity based on the publicity materials and combined with local tasks. Full attention must be paid to the publicity and explanation work before, after, and during the screening. During the Spring Festival, projection teams in various places should also take active measures to improve work efficiency.

IV. Cultural departments in major regions, provinces, and cities should organize affiliated theater troupes to conduct touring performances during the Spring Festival, and prepare appropriate programs according to the needs of publicizing the general line. In addition to carrying out their own performance activities, professional theater troupes must systematically conduct guidance work for amateur artistic activities.

V. Cultural centers and stations in various places should hold exhibitions, reports, book supplies, and other activities to publicize the general line of the transition period. Cultural centers with conditions can also organize cultural service teams or propaganda teams to tour rural areas to perform and conduct publicity, while vigorously helping to organize and guide rural mass amateur artistic activities. Cultural departments of various provinces and cities should formulate specific plans for the Spring Festival publicity work of cultural centers and stations.

VI. In order to do a good job in the supply of publicity materials for the Spring Festival, cultural departments at all levels should cooperate with local literary and art groups to compile and print a certain number of scripts, songs, folk art forms, clapper talks, and other materials. The Art Administration Bureau of the Ministry should immediately cooperate with the Chinese Dramatists Association and the Chinese Musicians Association to recommend and compile scripts and song materials suitable for Spring Festival publicity, and should cooperate with the Chinese Artists Association to produce and compile various propaganda posters (including New Year pictures) suitable for the publicity of the general line for use by various places. China Slide Company printed ten sets of slides related to the publicity of the general line, including Spark Collective Farm, Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative, How Wang Xiulan Leads the Mutual Aid Group, a Collective Farm in Siberia, Industrial Construction in New China, Anshan Iron and Steel, etc.; and sent sample films to the cultural departments of various provinces and cities for purchase or reproduction. At the same time, various places should make their own propaganda posters and slides according to local specific conditions and needs.

VII. Cultural departments in various places should mobilize and organize rural mass amateur artistic activities, organize guidance forces in various aspects, systematically conduct guidance work for mass amateur artistic activities, and supply materials for various literary and artistic activities. In the Spring Festival publicity, the strength of folk artists should be fully valued and brought into play, and they should be organized to participate in publicity activities. Mass amateur artistic activities should generally take small and diverse forms. During the Spring Festival, rural amateur theater troupes will inevitably have new developments. Attention should be paid to key guidance, cultivating typical examples, establishing backbones, and consolidating the foundation to prevent the tendency of blind development; and all extravagant waste and coercive orders should be prevented. In disaster-stricken areas, film projection teams should be dispatched to screen appropriate films free of charge, as well as show slides and hold exhibitions, but do not hold activities that increase the burden on the masses.

VIII. After receiving this instruction, the cultural departments of major regions, provinces, and cities should, in accordance with the specific conditions of various places, make specific plans for the 1954 Spring Festival literary and artistic publicity in conjunction with relevant groups, and deploy them in a timely manner. After the Spring Festival literary and artistic publicity work is completed, a summary should be made and reported to the Ministry.

    关于开展春节农村文艺活动向农民宣传总路线的指示
    一九五四年春节期间，各级政府文化主管部门应组织电影放映队，剧团，文化馆、站及其它文化事业机构和群众业余文化艺术组织（如农村俱乐部、农村剧团等）有计划地在各地农村及集镇中广泛开展群众文艺活动，进行国家在过渡时期的总路线的宣传，以加强对广大农民的社会主义教育，并满足群众对春节文化生活的要求。为此，特作如下指示：
    一、在宣传内容上，应以人民日报的有关社论和该报连续发表的“向农民宣传总路线”的文章为根据，结合当地情况，着重如下几点：（一）宣传过渡时期的总路线，以国家社会主义工业化和农业合作化的伟大目标鼓舞人民，并说明这是促进国家富强和彻底改善人民生活的唯一道路；（二）宣传发展互助合作运动和互助合作的好处，说明只有这样才能使农民摆脱资本主义剥削和穷困，过共同富裕的生活；（三）宣传扩大生产投资，作好春耕准备工作，改进技术，争取明年农业作物的增产；（四）宣传踊跃把粮食卖给国家，支援国家建设的重大意义；（五）宣传国家在工业、交通、水利等建设方面的成就及其对农村的巨大帮助，表扬工人阶级的劳动业迹和奋斗精神，加强进一步巩固工农联盟的思想；（六）介绍苏联社会主义的建设和人民的幸福生活，学习苏联人民过去为实现国家工业化和农业集体化的艰苦奋斗的精神。此外，仍应继续贯彻婚姻法的宣传，以及关于全国正在进行的普选运动的宣传。
    二、各级文化主管部门应即组织文艺工作者，按照上述精神，根据他们不同的生活经验和艺术特长，创作各种题材和形式的作品，把国家社会主义工业化和社会主义改造过程中的新事迹、新人物和新思想以及先进事物和落后事物的斗争，真实地描绘出来。应当从各个不同的生活角度去表现总路线，而不要勉强要求在每个作品中把总路线的一切方面都表现出来。形式应力求多样化。除电影、戏剧、幻灯等外，民间原有的戏曲（包括各种地方戏、木偶戏、皮影戏等）、曲艺、杂技及其他各种健康的文化娱乐节目，均可演出，不要在这些节目中生硬地加进宣传总路线的内容，可在演出前后或间歇时间，联系当地实际情况进行关于总路线的通俗的演讲。
      三、规定电影放映队于春节期间放映下列影片：故事片“丰收”、“葡萄熟了的时候”；纪录片“伟大的土地改革”、“抗美援朝第二辑”、“星火集体农庄”、“生产合作社”、“一九五三年国庆节”、“工业生产”、“水利建设”、“民间歌舞”；翻译苏联片“中国农民代表团访苏经过”、“光明照到高地村”（原名“光明照耀到克奥尔地村”）、“走向集体化的道路”（原名“被开垦的处女地”）。中国电影影片发行公司应即准备上项影片拷贝及宣传资料的供应，并作出影片的排片和周转计划。中国电影器材公司和各地修理站、放映队应即做好器材的准备、供应和放映机器检修工作。各地放映队应根据宣传资料结合当地任务，进行必要的适当的口头解释和宣传。放映前后和放映间的宣传、解释工作，必须充分重视。春节期间，各地放映队并应采取积极办法提高工作效率。
    四、各大区、省市文化主管部门，应组织所属剧团在春节期间进行巡回演出，按照宣传总路线的需要准备适当节目。各专业剧团除进行其本身的演出活动外，必须有计划地进行对于业余艺术活动的辅导工作。
    五、各地文化馆、站应举办展览、报告、图书供应等各项活动，以进行过渡时期总路线的宣传。有条件的文化馆并可组织文化服务队或宣传队到农村巡回表演，进行宣传，同时大力帮助组织和辅导农村群众业余艺术的活动。各省、市文化主管部门应订出文化馆、站春节宣传工作的具体计划。
    六、为了做好春节宣传的资料供应工作，各文化主管部门应协同当地文艺团体编印一定数量的剧本、歌曲、曲艺、快板等资料。本部艺术事业管理局应即协同中国戏剧家协会、中国音乐家协会，推荐和编印适合春节宣传的剧本和歌曲资料，并应协同中国美术家协会制作和编印适合总路线宣传的各种宣传画（包括新年画在内），供各地采用。中国幻灯公司印制有关总路线宣传的幻灯片十套，包括星火集体农庄、耿长锁农业生产合作社、王秀兰怎样领导互助组、西伯利亚的一个集体农庄、新中国的工业建设、鞍钢等；并将样片分寄各省、市文化主管部门，以备采购或翻印。同时，各地应根据当地具体情况和需要自制各种宣传画和幻灯片。
    七、各地文化主管部门应发动和组织农村群众业余艺术活动，组织各方面的辅导力量，有计划地进行对于群众业余艺术活动的辅导工作，并供应各种文艺活动的材料。在春节宣传中，应充分重视和发挥民间艺人的力量，组织他们参加宣传活动。群众业余艺术活动一般应采取小型的、多样的形式。在春节期间农村业余剧团必然有新的发展，应注意重点辅导，培养典型，建立骨干，巩固基础，防止盲目发展的倾向；并应防止一切铺张浪费、强迫命令的做法。在受灾地区，应派遣电影放映队免费放映适当的影片，以及放映幻灯、举行展览，但不要举办增加群众负担的活动。
    八、各大区、省、市文化主管部门，在接到这一指示后，应根据各地具体条件，会同有关团体做出一九五四年春节文艺宣传具体计划，及时布置下去。春节文艺宣传工作结束后，作出总结报部。
