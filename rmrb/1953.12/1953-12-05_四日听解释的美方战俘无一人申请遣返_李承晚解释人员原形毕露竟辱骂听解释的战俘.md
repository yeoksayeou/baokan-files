Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 4th: The U.S. side's explanation work to thirty South Korean POWs ended at 11:50 AM today. The entire explanation time was only two hours and five minutes. Having learned a lesson from the previous two days, the Syngman Rhee group's explanation personnel were afraid of hearing questions raised by the POWs again. They used shrugs, cold laughter, and announced to the Indian chairman "My explanation is finished," not allowing the POWs to say a single word. In Explanation Tent Number 4, when a Syngman Rhee explanation person told a POW that he would live a peaceful life upon returning to South Korea, the POW asked him: "Can you guarantee that?" The explanation person did not answer but turned to the Indian chairman and said: "My explanation is finished." This is how he escaped the predicament.

What was the same in today's explanation work as in the previous two days was that none of these thirty POWs applied for repatriation. What was different from the previous two days was that the Syngman Rhee group's explanation personnel no longer flaunted their American-made tape recorders, nor did they fiddle with photos. A look of weariness was revealed on their faces. One explanation person even violated Article 3 of the "Scope of Authority," which prohibits "insulting their dignity or self-respect," and began to insult the POWs.

The incident of abuse occurred in Explanation Tent Number 4. When a short, sturdy POW was preparing to ask the explainer his question, this Syngman Rhee explanation person crossed his left leg over his right leg, turned his face, and told the Indian chairman: "I am not prepared to continue the explanation." As the POW walked toward the door for those not applying for repatriation, he actually cursed the POW as a dog. Before this incident, this explanation person had also repeatedly violated the POWs' self-respect. As the third POW walked in and just sat down, he pointed his finger at the POW's face and spoke sternly. The POW told him sternly: "Put your hand down!" Later, when the POW indicated that he would not apply for repatriation, he actually made an arrogant gesture, flying into a rage and saying repeatedly: "What does it matter if you don't go? What are three hundred and twenty-odd people to the Republic of Korea?" When the fifth POW walked in and asked him: "When has the South Korean government ever cared about my family?" he said rudely: "What's so great about you? I don't think you're a great person!" The POW immediately questioned him in front of the five neutral nations' personnel: "What kind of attitude is this?" This Syngman Rhee explanation person then awkwardly defended himself, saying: "Humans are emotional animals, and sometimes they can't help but be impulsive..."

Two days ago, these Syngman Rhee explanation personnel had humbly called the POWs "warriors," and the U.S. news agencies also boasted about their "gentle and refined" attitude during the explanations, saying that they would use "honorifics" for the explanations. However, the fact that sixty POWs did not apply for repatriation in the past two days made them so angry that their true colors were revealed.

Today the weather was colder, and the thirty POWs listening to the explanations were all wearing neat blue winter uniforms and warm leather boots. Like the previous two days, they quietly pondered while listening to the explanations. One POW even smiled and offered a cigarette to the Indian soldier sitting next to him. This was a stark contrast to the situation in Tongchang-ri. In the explanation tents in Tongchang-ri, our captured personnel were threatened by Lee Chiang secret agents that if they did not shout "Return to Taiwan," they would be tortured, and if they requested repatriation, they would be killed. Therefore, as soon as they entered the tent, they shouted loudly, or they were so frightened that they were covered in sweat, trembling all over, and mentally distraught.

At noon, all thirty POWs who did not apply for repatriation carried their luggage to the isolation camp, where the Korean and Chinese side had built neat houses for them, installed stoves, and prepared sufficient fuel to keep out the cold. There, they still had the opportunity to apply for repatriation. This also formed a sharp contrast to the situation in Tongchang-ri. In Tongchang-ri, our captured personnel had to risk double the danger, climbing over the barbed wire fence, to have the opportunity to apply for repatriation.

### 四日听解释的美方战俘无一人申请遣返  李承晚解释人员原形毕露竟辱骂听解释的战俘

    四日听解释的美方战俘无一人申请遣返
    李承晚解释人员原形毕露竟辱骂听解释的战俘
    【新华社开城四日电】今天美方对三十名南朝鲜战俘的解释工作，在上午十一点五十分就结束了。全部解释时间只有两小时零五十分钟。李承晚集团的解释人员接受了前两天的教训，害怕再听到战俘提出的问题。他们用耸肩冷笑和向印度主席宣布“我的解释结束了”，不让战俘说一句话。在第四号解释帐篷，当李承晚解释人员对一个战俘说他回到南朝鲜将要过和平生活时，战俘就问他：“是不是可以保证？”这个解释人员不作回答，却转向印度主席说：“我的解释结束了。”这样他才逃出了窘境。
    今天的解释工作和前两天相同的是这三十名战俘都没有申请遣返。和前两天不同的是：李承晚集团的解释人员不再炫耀他们的美制的录音机，也不再摆弄照片。他们脸上显露出厌倦的神色。一个解释人员甚至违反“职权范围”第三款关于不得对战俘“侮辱其尊严或自尊”的规定，辱骂起战俘来了。
    骂人的事件发生在第四号解释帐篷。当一个个子不高的结实的战俘准备向解释者提出他的问题时，这个李承晚解释人员就把左腿往右腿上一架，转过脸告诉印度主席：“我不准备继续解释了。”战俘向不申请遣返的门走去时，他竟骂战俘是狗。在这一次以前，这个解释人员也有过多次侵犯战俘自尊的行动。第三个走进来的战俘刚刚坐下，他就用手指着战俘的脸厉声讲话，这个战俘严正地告诉他：
  “把你的手放下来！”后来，战俘表示不申请遣返，他居然做出傲慢的姿势，恼羞成怒地连续说：“你不去有什么关系？三百二十多个人对大韩民国算得了什么？”第五个走进去的战俘问他：“南朝鲜政府在什么时候关心过我的家庭？”他就粗暴地说：“你有什么了不得？我认为你不是了不得的人！”这个战俘立刻当着五个中立国人员的面质询他：“你这是什么态度？”这个李承晚解释人员才尴尬地辩解说：“人是感情的动物，有时就不免冲动……”
    在两天以前，这些李承晚解释人员曾低声下气地称战俘为“勇士”，美方通讯社也吹嘘他们进行解释时的“温文尔雅”的态度，说他们将用“敬语”来进行解释。可是过去两天中六十名战俘不申请遣返，却就使他们恼怒得原形毕露了。
    今天天气较冷，听取解释的三十个战俘都穿着整洁的蓝色冬衣和温暖的皮靴，他们和前两天一样，在听解释时安静地思索着，一个战俘还微笑着请坐在他旁边的印度兵吸烟。这和东场里的情形是一个强烈的对照。在东场里解释帐篷中，我方被俘人员因为李蒋特务恐吓他们说如不喊“回台湾”就要被拷打，如果要求遣返将被杀死，所以一进帐篷就大喊大叫，或者恐惧得满头大汗，混身发抖，精神恍惚。
    中午，没有申请遣返的三十名战俘全部扛着行李走向隔离营场，在那里朝中方面已经为他们盖好了整洁的房舍，装置了火炉，准备了充分的燃料以御寒。在那里，他们仍有申请遣返的机会。这和东场里的情形也形成了一个尖锐的对照。在东场里，我方的被俘人员要冒着双重危险，翻出铁丝网，才有申请遣返的机会。
