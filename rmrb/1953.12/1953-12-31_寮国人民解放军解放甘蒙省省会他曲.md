    The Lao Resistance Government announced that the Lao People's Liberation Army entered Thakhek, the capital of Khammouane Province in central Laos, on the evening of December 25, according to a Vietnam News Agency dispatch on the 29th.
    Xinhua News Agency, December 30th: According to a Vietnam News Agency dispatch on the 29th, a military reporter commented on the Lao People's Liberation Army's major victory on the Thakhek front:
    Thakhek, the capital of Khammouane Province, is located in central Laos on the left bank of the Mekong River. It is the intersection of two important highways: Highway 13, which runs north to Vientiane and south to southern Laos and Cambodia, and Highway 12, which runs east to central Vietnam.
    The Lao People's Liberation Army, acting on the orders of the Lao Resistance Government, marched south to Thakhek from its base in the north. They crossed high mountains and dense forests, disregarding hardship and difficulty, determined to complete their mission.
    The flames of hatred for the French aggressors burned in the hearts of each of them, and they told each other about the unforgettable events that occurred in Thakhek on March 21, 1946, when the French aggressors invaded Laos: At that time, French aircraft inhumanely bombed and strafed thousands of Lao and Vietnamese civilians crossing the Mekong River, and hundreds of people died in this barbaric massacre, their blood staining the waters of the Mekong River red; on the same day, the French aggressors arrested and shot thousands of Lao and Vietnamese civilians in Thakhek who had not escaped the clutches of the aggressors. Since then, Thakhek and the Lao people have forever remembered March 21st.
    Now, thousands of Lao people's fighters, with anger burning in their hearts, launched fierce attacks on enemy strongholds along Highway 12. After fierce fighting, they completely annihilated the French troops stationed in Dungmal and the French troops near Napo in Mugia Pass; then, they pursued the fleeing enemy, and on the night of December 25, the vanguard of the Lao People's Liberation Army entered Thakhek. The Lao flag—the banner of independence and peace—flies joyfully over this historically significant city. Residents who have long lived under the iron heel of the colonialists have seen the light of day again and enthusiastically come out to welcome the victorious army. The brilliant victory in central Laos has liberated vast areas of land on the Laos-Vietnam border and the Laos-Thailand border, and has created favorable conditions for advancing the heroic resistance of the Lao people.

    寮国人民解放军解放甘蒙省省会他曲
    【新华社三十日讯】据越南通讯社二十九日讯：寮国抗战政府发表公报说，寮国人民解放军已于十二月二十五日晚进入寮国中部甘蒙省省会他曲。
    【新华社三十日讯】据越南通讯社二十九日讯：军事记者评论寮国人民解放军在他曲前线的重大胜利说：
    甘蒙省省会他曲位于寮国中部和湄公河的左岸，是两条重要公路——北至万象、南至寮国南部和高棉的第十三号公路，与东至越南中部的第十二号公路——的交叉点。
    寮国人民解放军奉寮国抗战政府的命令，从北部的根据地向南进军他曲。他们跨过了高山，穿过了密林，不顾艰苦和困难，决心完成任务。
    仇恨法国侵略者的火焰在他们每个人的心中燃烧，他们彼此诉说着法国侵略者侵入寮国时——一九四六年三月二十一日在他曲发生的难忘的事件：那时法国飞机惨无人道地向渡过湄公河的数千名寮国和越南平民滥施轰炸和扫射，有数百人死在这次野蛮的大屠杀中，他们的鲜血染红了湄公河的河水；在同一天，法国侵略者在他曲城逮捕并枪杀了上千名没有逃出侵略者魔掌的寮国和越南平民。从那时起，他曲和寮国人民永远记住了三月二十一日。
    现在，心头燃烧着怒火的数千名寮国人民的战士向第十二号公路上的敌军据点猛烈攻击。经过激烈的战斗后，全歼驻在容马勒的法军和穆嘉关附近那爆的法军；接着，又跟踪追击残敌，到十二月二十五日夜，寮国人民解放军先头部队进入了他曲。寮国的国旗——独立与和平的旗帜——欢乐地飘扬在这座具有历史意义的城市的上空。长久生活在殖民者铁蹄下的居民重见天日，踊跃出来欢迎胜利的军队。寮国中部的辉煌胜利使寮越边境和寮泰边境的广大土地获得解放，并为推进寮国人民的英雄的抗战创造了有利的条件。
