Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 20th—As of December 15th, incomplete statistics from the Northeast region show that 185 state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines have completed their annual production plans ahead of schedule. Among them are the following state-owned factories and mines: Northeast No. 53 Factory, Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Medium Rolling Mill, Iron Smelting Plant, First Thin Plate Plant, Oxygen Plant, Gongchangling Iron Mine's Cherry Orchard Mine, Fuxin Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine, Fushun Open-Pit Coal Mine, Northeast Petroleum No. 1 Plant, Northeast Petroleum No. 7 Plant, Shenyang Smelting Plant, Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant, Shenyang Transformer Plant, Mining Machinery Plant, Shenyang Water Pump Plant, Shenyang Woolen Mill, Northeast First Cement Plant, Northeast Second Glass Factory, Dalian Industrial and Mining Vehicle Plant, Crane Plant, Light Bulb Factory, and Harbin Ball Bearing Factory, totaling 65 factories and mines; Local state-owned factories include Shenyang Metal Products Factory, Shenyang Leather Factory, Shenyang Wood Factory, Liaoxi Paint Factory, Liaodong Chemical Branch Factory, and Songjiang Pharmaceutical Factory, totaling 120 factories and mines. From January to the end of November this year, the total output value of factories and mines in the Northeast under the Central People's Government's Ministry of Heavy Industry, Ministry of Fuel Industry, Ministry of First Machine Industry, Ministry of Textile Industry, and Ministry of Light Industry has reached 96.1% of the annual plan, an increase of 12.9% compared to the total output value of last year; the total output value of local state-owned industries in the eleven provinces and cities of the Northeast region has also reached 93.1% of the annual plan. Based on the above situation and the production situation since December, it is estimated that in addition to completing the annual production plan for this year, state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines in the Northeast region will also increase production and save several trillion yuan worth of wealth for the country.
	Of the 58 major products of state-owned industry in the entire region, 21, including gasoline, kerosene, rich iron ore, sintered ore, electrolytic copper, electrolytic zinc, concentrated nitric acid, generators, electric motors, transformers, rubber wire, light bulbs, steam boilers, lathes, drilling machines, ball bearings, water pumps, bicycles, rock drills, drilling rigs, and linen textiles, have reached or exceeded their annual planned output. The output of another 10 major products, such as pig iron, is also close to the annual planned output. It is expected that by the end of the year, the output of 50 major products in the entire region will exceed the annual national plan requirements.
	Due to the reduction in product costs, it is expected that state-owned factories and mines in the Northeast region will also overfulfill the annual profit delivery plan. From January to September this year, the product costs of state-owned industries in the Northeast region have been reduced by more than 370 billion yuan compared to the plan. By the end of October, factories and mines under the four industrial systems of state-owned coal mines, electricity, petroleum, and non-ferrous metals in the region had completed their annual profit delivery plans ahead of schedule.
	Xinhua News Agency, 18th—After three consecutive months of increasing production and practicing economy, factories and mines in the North China region have provided a strong guarantee for overfulfilling the national plan. By the end of November, 205 state-owned and local state-owned units in the region had completed their annual national plan or increased production and practiced economy plan ahead of schedule. Among them, Beijing has 50 units, including Shijingshan Power Plant, First Machine Tool Plant, North China Agricultural Machinery General Plant, and People's Printing Plant; Tianjin has 52 units, including Bicycle Factory, Power Machine Factory, and Third Machine Factory; Hebei Province has 65 units, including Tangshan Steel Plant, Xiayou Garden Mining Bureau, and Zhangjiakou Flour Mill; Shanxi Province has 29 units, including Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant, Taiyuan Cement Plant, and Luan Coal Mine; Suiyuan Province has 9 units, including Guancun Mica Factory and Baotou Leather Factory. Although the national plan indicators for November were generally higher than those for October, the completion of the plan was better than that of October, with state-owned factories and mines completing 106% of the output value plan and local state-owned factories and mines completing 121.9% of the output value plan. Advanced units that have completed the national plan have also added increased production plans and profit delivery plans.
	Over the past three months, most factories and mines in the North China region have combined the campaign to increase production and practice economy with improving management and enhancing technology, resulting in a new situation: the improvement of labor productivity is not based on shock production and increased labor intensity, but on effectively solving key problems in production, improving operating techniques, implementing suggestions from Soviet experts, and establishing and improving management systems. Hebei Province's machinery, cotton textile, coal, and flour industries organized inter-factory competitions in the same industry, which yielded results in exchanging advanced technologies and management experiences and promoting the completion of national plans with each other. The 37 units participating in the competition were able to maintain their enthusiasm throughout. Trade union organizations in Tianjin widely promoted the experience of advanced Soviet production meetings in the competition. For example, 151 of the 158 groups in the municipal system established a group production meeting system. Through production meetings, specific issues such as the coordination between different types of work, reducing defective products, and the led promotion of advanced experience were resolved in a timely manner. In the competition, the Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant focused on solving the problem of fully implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts. The plant's administration and trade union signed a collective contract for implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts. All employees of the plant not only ensured safe power supply and overfulfilled the power generation and sales plans during the competition, but also made great strides in technical management. The phenomenon of quality degradation that occurred after the competition was launched in the past rarely occurred in this year's competition. Accidents and casualties have also decreased compared to the past.
	Currently, factories and mines are further developing sustained campaigns to increase production and practice economy on the existing basis, and are actively preparing for next year's production, ensuring that the production in the first quarter of next year is no lower than the level in the fourth quarter of this year.

    东北华北许多厂矿完成全年计划
     【新华社沈阳二十日电】东北区到十二月十五日止的不完全统计，先后已有一百八十五个国营和地方国营厂矿提前完成了全年生产计划。其中国营厂矿有：东北五三工厂、鞍山钢铁公司中型轧钢厂、炼铁厂、第一薄板厂、养气厂、弓长岭铁矿樱桃园矿山、阜新海州露天煤矿、抚顺露天煤矿、东北石油一厂、东北石油七厂、沈阳冶炼厂、沈阳重型机器厂、沈阳变压器厂、矿山机械厂、沈阳水泵厂、沈阳毛织厂、东北第一水泥厂、东北第二玻璃厂、大连工矿车辆厂、起重机厂、灯泡厂和哈尔滨滚珠轴承厂等六十五个厂矿；地方国营工厂有沈阳金属用品制造厂、沈阳皮革厂、沈阳木器厂、辽西涂料厂、辽东化学分厂和松江制药厂等一百二十个厂矿。今年一月到十一月底，中央人民政府重工业部、燃料工业部、第一机械工业部、纺织工业部、轻工业部在东北各厂矿的生产总值，已达到全年计划百分之九十六点一，比去年全年的生产总值增长百分之十二点九；东北区十一个省市地方国营工业的生产总值，也已达全年计划百分之九十三点一。根据以上情况和十二月份以来的生产情况，预计东北区各国营、地方国营厂矿除能完成今年全年生产计划外，还能为国家增产节约价值若干万亿元的财富。
    全区国营工业五十八种主要产品中，已有汽油、煤油、富铁矿、烧结矿、电铜、电锌、浓硝酸、发电机、电动机、变压器、橡皮线、电灯泡、蒸汽锅炉、车床、钻床、滚珠轴承、水泵、自行车、凿岩机、钻探机、亚麻纺织品等二十一种达到或超过了全年计划产量。另有生铁等十种主要产品的产量也已接近全年计划产量。预计到年底，全区可有五十种主要产品的产量超过全年国家计划要求。
    东北区国营厂矿由于产品成本的降低，预计全年上缴利润计划也可超额完成。今年一月到九月，东北区国营工业产品成本已比计划降低了三千七百多亿元。到十月底，全区国营煤矿、电业、石油和有色金属等四个工业系统所属厂矿，已提前完成全年上缴利润计划。
    【新华社十八日讯】华北区各厂矿经过连续三个月的增产节约竞赛，已为超额完成国家计划提供了有力的保证。全区国营、地方国营厂矿到十一月底止，已有二百零五个单位提前完成了全年国家计划或增产节约计划。其中，北京市有石景山发电厂、第一机床厂、华北农业机械总厂、人民印刷厂等五十个单位；天津市有自行车厂、动力机器厂、第三机器厂等五十二个单位；河北省有唐山钢厂、下花园矿务局、张家口面粉厂等六十五个单位；山西省有太原矿山机器厂、太原水泥厂、潞安煤矿等二十九个单位；绥远省有官村云母厂、包头皮革厂等九个单位。十一月份国家计划的指标虽然比十月份普遍提高了，但完成计划的情况却比十月份更好，计国营厂矿完成产值计划百分之一百零六，地方国营厂矿完成产值计划百分之一百二十一点九。已经完成国家计划的先进单位，并纷纷追加了增产计划和上缴利润的计划。
    三个月来，华北区多数厂矿把增产节约竞赛和改进管理、提高技术相结合，因而普遍出现了一种新的情况：劳动生产率的提高不是建立在突击生产和增加劳动强度的基础之上，而是建立在切实解决生产中的关键问题、改进操作技术、实现苏联专家建议、建立和改善管理制度等的基础之上。河北省机器、棉纺、煤、面粉等四类工业组织了同行业的厂际竞赛，在交流先进的技术和管理经验上，在相互推动完成国家计划上，都有了收获。参加竞赛的三十七个单位能够始终保持饱满的热情。天津市的工会组织在竞赛中普遍推广了苏联先进的生产会议的经验，如市政系统一百五十八个小组中，就有一百五十一个小组建立了小组生产会议制度。通过生产会议，就及时解决了各个不同工种之间的相互配合、减少废品次品和有领导地推广先进经验等方面的具体问题。北京石景山发电厂在竞赛中着重解决了全面贯彻苏联专家建议的问题，厂的行政和工会为贯彻苏联专家建议订立了集体合同，全厂职工不但在竞赛中保证了安全供电，超额完成了发电和售电计划，而且技术管理水平也向前迈进了一大步。过去竞赛展开后发生质量降低的现象在今年的竞赛中很少出现。事故伤亡情况也比过去有所减少。
    现在各厂矿正在已有的基础上，进一步展开持续的增产节约竞赛，并积极做好明年生产的准备工作，保证明年第一季度的生产不低于今年第四季度的水平。
