    Strengthening the supply of non-staple foods in cities and industrial and mining areas has become increasingly important.

    Due to the start of national economic construction, the population of cities and industrial and mining areas has increased, and people's purchasing power has improved (for example, the population of Anshan increased by 90,000 in the first half of the year, and purchasing power increased by 14.5 percent). People's consumption of non-staple foods such as oil, meat, fish, eggs, fresh and dried vegetables has also increased in order to improve their lives. Taking edible oil in Shanghai as an example, the average monthly sales from 1951 to 1952 were about 50,000 dan, while the average monthly sales in the first quarter of this year increased to 74,000 dan, and the average monthly sales in the second quarter increased to 92,000 dan. As for pork, the daily sales in Beijing were less than 700 heads in 1951, 1,000 heads in 1952, and 1,200 to 1,500 heads this year, increasing to nearly 2,000 heads on Sundays. However, on the other hand, the growth of some non-staple food production lags behind the growth of consumption. For example, the highest annual output of tree ears before the war was 114,387 dan, while this year's output was 62,593 dan, only 54.7 percent of the pre-war level. Although some non-staple foods have increased in production, they still cannot fully meet the needs. For example, the production of vegetables in the suburbs of large cities cannot keep up with the increase in consumption. The supply of non-staple foods is related to the daily lives of the broad masses of working people and urban residents, and is an important issue for maintaining and improving the welfare of the broad masses of the people. Therefore, we must strengthen the supply of non-staple foods to cities and industrial and mining areas, and strengthen planning in the supply work to meet the needs of the people in cities and industrial and mining areas.

    Now, the New Year and Spring Festival are approaching, and this period has always been the peak consumption season. In addition, this year, after farmers sell a large amount of surplus grain, their consumption of non-staple foods will also increase. Therefore, on the basis of doing a good job in the usual supply of non-staple foods, we must pay attention to and do a good job in the supply of non-staple foods during the New Year and Spring Festival.

    How can we do a good job in the supply of non-staple foods for the New Year and Spring Festival? Based on the current supply of non-staple foods and past experience, we should start from the following aspects:

    (1) Strengthen unified leadership and make comprehensive festival supply plans.

    Because there are many kinds of non-staple foods and the quantity is huge, we must unify public and private forces and organize the supply of goods in a planned way to ensure supply. All localities must clarify the division of labor and closely integrate the work of various business and administrative departments under the unified leadership of the local financial committee to play a leading role in the market. The supply plans of state-owned companies, cooperatives, and private merchants should be linked together. Last year, the supply of live pigs in Beijing during the National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival holidays was not well coordinated due to the failure to connect the comprehensive plans of state-owned companies, cooperatives, and private merchants, resulting in great losses. The Native Produce Company alone lost 2.8 billion yuan. This lesson must be learned. To this end, all localities must convene meetings of relevant public and private industries before the festival to formulate comprehensive supply plans based on the consumption quantity during the festival in previous years and the current situation, and clarify the specific tasks of state-owned companies, cooperatives, and private businesses, assign responsibilities, and ensure the realization of the plans.

    (2) Actively organize the source of goods and do a good job in allocation and transportation.

    According to the formulated supply plan, and in accordance with the law of commodity circulation, delineate regions and specifically allocate purchase tasks. State-owned trading companies and cooperatives in producing areas should strengthen procurement. China has a vast territory and abundant resources. As long as we send more procurement teams to go deep into the countryside for procurement, we can guarantee the supply to cities. For example, the North China region originally felt a lack of pork sources, but the situation has improved since strengthening unified procurement. Therefore, actively organizing the source of goods is an important key to doing a good job in the New Year's supply work.

    While actively organizing the source of goods, we must pay attention to doing a good job in allocation and transportation. Because the festival supply situation changes quickly and is time-sensitive, and the New Year and Spring Festival are the busiest periods for transportation, it is even more necessary to have plans and preparations; according to different transportation conditions, distinguish between priorities and urgencies, and make full use of various transportation tools. All localities must strengthen transportation work to ensure the timeliness of allocation and transportation work and prevent supply and sales from being disconnected.

    (3) Organize sales in a planned way and oppose conservative reluctance to sell.

    Many seasonal non-staple foods have a certain sales period. If the season is missed, it is most likely to cause stockpiles. For example, the Shanghai Native Produce Company sold dried longan before the Spring Festival in 1952 for 12,000 yuan per catty, and many people were crowded to buy them. But after the Spring Festival, the price fell to 8,000 yuan per catty, and it was not easy to sell them even when they were sent to government agencies and factories. This is the reason why the sales season was missed. At present, some companies have conservative reluctance to sell popular non-staple foods. For example, the sales plan for several popular commodities of the Beijing Native Produce Company in October was poorly completed. Daylily only completed 21.82 percent of the plan, pickled mustard tuber completed 27 percent, and star anise completed 42 percent. The reason for not completing the plan is not that there is no source of goods, nor that the market does not need it, but that due to conservative reluctance to sell, there is no active promotion. Therefore, companies at all levels should regularly check their inventory, calculate the number of future sales, and organize sales in a timely manner. In particular, commodities that meet the needs of the festival must be sold in large quantities during the festival to meet the needs of the festival and avoid stockpiles after the festival. Of course, for commodities that are indeed in short supply, we must prevent private merchants from buying and hoarding; however, preventing buying is not not selling goods, but to organize the supply in a planned way, that is, first meet the needs of retail companies and cooperatives, and then supply private retailers according to their strength in a planned way. Only when the goods are truly delivered to consumers can the supply task be completed, and blind conservative reluctance to sell should be corrected.

    (4) Strengthen market management and ensure the stability of prices.

    At present, the market situation of native produce and non-staple foods in both producing and selling areas is not very normal. The situation of raising prices in the producing areas and competing for materials continues to occur, which is detrimental to ensuring supply, stabilizing prices, and supporting production. The emergence of this situation is mainly due to the speculation and disruption of private merchants, and also due to the unclear division of labor between state-owned trading companies and cooperatives and the lack of unified procurement discipline. In order to reverse the above situation, we should first strengthen the management of unified procurement within state-owned companies and cooperatives, and correct the practice of chaotic procurement and搶货源. At the same time, we should strengthen the management of private merchants, prohibit them from raising prices and搶购, and punish serious speculative and disruptive behaviors according to law.

    In the sales market, we must strengthen the education and leadership of private merchants, because there are many private merchant industries and the supply surface is wide, so we should make good use of them. However, in order to prevent their speculative behavior, we should stipulate the discipline of not raising prices and not adulterating and short-weighing through the covenant to ensure the supply of the New Year and Spring Festival in various related industries, and conscientiously implement it. For prices, we can take the method of negotiated prices to make the listed price consistent with the market price. In price negotiation, we should pay attention to preventing over-reporting costs and reducing quality, so as to prevent speculators from obtaining illegal profits under the banner of "unified price negotiation." After the festival comes, we must strengthen inspections, and mobilize workers and citizens to supervise in order to ensure the stability of prices during the New Year.

    怎样做好新年春节副食品的供应工作
    中央商业部农产品收购局副局长　吴建华
    中国土产公司副经理　陈静之
    加强城市、工矿区副食品的供应工作，已日益显出它的重要性。
    由于国家经济建设开始，城市和工矿区人口增加，人民购买力提高（如鞍山上半年人口增加九万，购买力提高百分之十四点五），人民为改善生活，对油、肉、鱼、蛋、干鲜蔬菜等副食品的消费也随之扩大了。以上海食油为例，一九五一年至一九五二年每月平均销量约五万多担，而今年第一季度每月平均销量增至七万四千担，第二季度每月平均销量增为九万二千担；又如猪肉，北京一九五一年日销量不到七百头，一九五二年为一千头，今年为一千二百头至一千五百头，星期日增至近二千头。但另方面，有些副食品生产的增长，却落后在消费增长的后面，如木耳，战前全国最高年产量为十一万四千三百八十七担，而今年产量为六万二千五百九十三担，仅为战前百分之五四点七。有些副食品虽有增长，却还不能完全适应需要，如大城市郊区蔬菜的生产，就还赶不上消费量的增加。而副食品的供应，关系到广大劳动人民和市民的日常生活，是维护和增进广大人民生活福利的一个重要问题。因此我们必须加强对城市、工矿区副食品的供应工作，并在供应工作中加强计划性，以满足城市、工矿区人民生活的需要。
    现在，新年、春节快要到来，历年来这一时期都是消费最旺季节，加之今年农民大量出售余粮后，对副食品的消费也会有所增多。因此，我们要在做好平时的副食品供应工作基础上，重视和做好新年、春节期间副食品的供应工作。
    怎样才能做好新年、春节副食品的供应工作呢？根据目前副食品的供应情况和过去的经验，应从以下几个方面着手：
    （一）加强统一领导，做好全面的节日供应计划。
    由于副食品种类繁多、数量巨大，必须统一公私力量，有计划地组织货源，保证供应。各地必须在当地财委统一领导下，各业务、行政部门应明确分工，密切结合，以发挥对市场的领导作用。并把国营公司、合作社、私商的供应计划衔接起来。去年国庆、中秋节两个节日北京市的生猪供应，就由于国营公司、合作社、私商的全面计划未能衔接好，结果造成很大损失，仅土产公司即亏损了二十八亿元，这一教训必须记取。为此，各地必须在节前分别召开公私有关行业会议，根据历年节期消费数量和目前情况，拟定全面供应计划，并明确国营公司、合作社和私营商业的具体任务，分工负责，保证计划的实现。
    （二）积极组织货源，做好调拨运输工作。
    根据制定的供应计划，按照商品流转规律，划定地区，具体分配收购任务。产地国营贸易公司和合作社更应加强收购。我国地区广阔，物产丰富，只要多派收购小组，深入农村收购，是可以保证城市供应的。如华北区本来猪源很感缺乏，但自加强统一收购后，情况已有好转。因此，积极组织货源，这是做好年节供应工作的重要关键。
    在积极组织货源的同时，必须注意做好调拨运输工作，因为节日供应情况变化较快，时间性大，而新年、春节期间又是运输最繁忙的时期，这就更需要有计划，有准备；按照不同运输条件，分别轻重缓急，充分利用各种运输工具。各地必须加强运输方面的工作，以保证调拨运输工作的及时，不使供销脱节。
    （三）有计划地组织推销，反对保守惜售思想。
    很多应节副食品有一定销售时期，如果错过季节，最易造成积压，如上海市土产公司在一九五二年春节前出售桂圆，每斤一万二千元，买的人很拥挤，但过春节以后，每斤落到八千元，送到机关工厂内去还不好销售，这就是错过了销售季节的原因。目前有些公司对畅销副食品存在着保守惜售思想，如北京市土产公司十月份的几种畅销商品销售计划完成的很差，黄花菜仅完成计划的百分之二一·八二，榨菜完成百分之二七，大料完成百分之四二；未完成计划的原因，不是没有货源，也不是市场上不需要，而是由于保守惜售思想，没有积极推销。因此，各级公司应该经常检查自己的库存，计算今后销售数量，适时地组织推销，特别是适应节日需要的商品，必须在节期大量销出去，以满足节日的需要，并避免节日过后造成积压。当然对确实货源不足的商品，要防止私商套购囤积；但是防止套购不是有货不卖，而是要有计划的组织供应，即先满足零售公司、合作社的需要，再根据力量有计划的供给私营零售商。只有真正把货物送到消费者手里，才算完成了供应的任务，盲目的保守惜售是应该改正的。
      （四）加强市场管理，保证物价的稳定。
    目前土产副食品产销两地市场情况不很正常，在产区抬高价格，争购物资情况不断发生，这对保证供应，稳定物价，支持生产，均为不利。这一情况的产生，主要是私商的投机捣乱，另外也由于国营贸易公司与合作社分工不清，缺乏统一采购纪律。为扭转以上情况，首先应从国营公司与合作社内部加强统一采购的管理，纠正乱采购和抢货源的做法，同时应加强私商管理，不准其抬价抢购，对严重的投机捣乱行为还要依法给予惩处。
    在销售市场上，要加强对私商的教育与领导，因为私商行业多，供应面广，因之应很好加以利用。但为防止其投机行为，应在各个有关行业中通过保证新年、春节供应的公约，规定不准抬价，不准掺假短秤的纪律，并认真贯彻执行。对于价格，可采取议价办法，使牌市价一致。在议价中要注意防止多报成本，降低质量的情况，以免投机商在“统一议价”招牌下，获取非法暴利。在节期来到后要加强检查，并可发动工人与市民进行监督以保证年节物价的稳定。
