(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 22nd) The U.S. side is attempting to dispatch so-called "defense lawyers" to "defend" the seven Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agent murderers who killed Zhang Zilong, a captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, in the military court of the Indian Custodial Forces. Their purpose is obviously to cover up the heinous crimes of these murderers and thereby evade the serious responsibility of the U.S. side for instructing these criminals to murder prisoners of war who requested repatriation.

However, the ironclad evidence of the case of Zhang Zilong's murder by U.S. special agents is irrefutable and cannot be overturned by any means of denial by the U.S. side. The following is the account of the murder of Zhang Zilong, revealed by twenty-eight of our captured personnel who came forward to testify and request repatriation during the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's investigation into the Zhang Zilong murder incident.

(1) Zhang Zilong Suffered Cruel Persecution for Firmly Demanding Repatriation

Zhang Zilong, a 26-year-old native of Jiangsu, was a sergeant in a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. After being captured in 1951, he had been living in the Busan POW Hospital. In July 1952, he was sent to Camp No. 3 in Moseulpo, Jeju Island. After being handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for custody on September 13, 1953, he was in the first squad of the third company of the twenty-eighth camp. Zhang Zilong had been firmly demanding repatriation to his country, but the U.S. side forcibly classified him as a so-called "rejecting repatriation" prisoner of war. In September and October of last year, while on Jeju Island, he attempted three times to escape from the POW camp detaining so-called "rejecting repatriation" prisoners of war to the No. 8 POW camp detaining direct repatriation prisoners of war, but was caught by U.S. military sentries and escorted back to the original camp. After being caught and returned to the camp for the third time, he was imprisoned in the seventh squad of the second company for about 20 days. Later, he was transferred to the fourth squad of the third company. The "squad leader" of that squad, Li Ziqi, subjected him to various abuses, forcing him to do various hard labor tasks every day. He also often used excuses such as unbuttoned clothing buttons to subject him to beatings and various forms of torture. In April of this year, when Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents, under the instigation of the U.S. side, conducted a violent "purge of pro-return to mainland elements" in the POW camp, Zhang Zilong was severely beaten by special agent elements. Two or three days after the armistice, the special agents forcibly tattooed Kuomintang flags, party emblems, and two lines of eight characters, "Oppose Communism and Resist Russia," on his chest and back, and the three characters "Return to Taiwan" on his left wrist.

On the morning of September 18th, during the process of transferring prisoners of war to the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the special agents of the twenty-eighth camp assembled the entire brigade of prisoners of war and forced them to hurl insults at our observers. Zhang Zilong was unwilling to go out. The "company commander" of the third company forced him to go out of the tent and curse Chairman Mao. He immediately replied, "I won't curse." The "company commander" then slapped him twice and ordered the special agents to beat him severely with wooden sticks. Then, he was punished by balancing a bowl of water on his head, staring directly at the sun, and holding a basin full of water with both hands for a total of two hours. Whenever he was unable to support himself and the water spilled, the special agents would beat him indiscriminately with wooden sticks. The next morning, the special agent elements subjected him to the same cruel torture for more than two hours and punished him by depriving him of food for two days. Later, the special agents asked him almost every day, "Where are you going back to?" Zhang Zilong did not answer each time. The special agents forced him to recite "Return to Taiwan! Return to Taiwan!" like a book, but he refused to say it. The special agent elements beat him severely, and punished him by stripping him naked, standing with his legs half-bent for two whole nights, and not allowing him to sleep during the day or giving him food.

(2) The Circumstances of Zhang Zilong's Murder

At about 9:00 a.m. on October 2nd, the special agents of the twenty-eighth camp forced the prisoners of war to hold a demonstration against the Indian Custodial Forces. Zhang Zilong did not shout or wave a flag at all. The third "company commander" immediately ran over and ordered him to curse Chairman Mao three times in a row, but he refused to curse. The special agents dragged him into a tent and beat him up. At about 4:00 p.m. that day, Zhang Zilong was escorted to the third "company headquarters." After dark, Zhang Zilong was tied up with his hands and feet bound together, and hung on the tent pole. The third "company commander" Chen Fusheng, the "health instructor," the "security captain" Wu Baoshan, and several "squad leaders" took turns beating him severely, leaving his face covered in blood. Despite the special agents' repeated beatings, Zhang Zilong remained unyielding and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" At about 12:00 a.m. that night, Zhang Zilong was carried back to the eleventh squad tent. All his clothes were torn, and many places on his head and body were injured, with fresh blood flowing.

At dawn on October 3rd, the special agents dragged him to the third "company headquarters" again. After breakfast that day, Zhang Zilong's hands were tied with tent ropes and hung from the middle beam near the east entrance of the third "company headquarters" tent. Zhang Zilong, who was in a semi-comatose state, occasionally lowered his head, and the third "company commander" would knock his head with half a flagpole, demanding that he lift his head. Later, the third "company commander" tied up his feet and hung him up as well. In this way, Zhang Zilong was hung horizontally, with his back facing up and his stomach facing down, about four feet above the ground. At this time, another special agent, Duan Wenxian, took a roll of Kuomintang newspapers and kraft paper, lit them on fire, and burned his stomach. After a roll of paper was burned, the third "company commander" poured a small bottle of gasoline on his shorts, and Duan Wenxian lit it with a lighter. Instantly, the fire burned on his lower body. Because he was in so much pain that his whole body trembled violently, the fire splashed and burned everywhere. After the burning, his buttocks, waist, and back were burned with cracked skin, turning black and purple. The third "company commander" then placed a piece of paper sprinkled with gasoline on Zhang Zilong's back and lit it on fire, filling the tent inside and out with a foul-smelling stench. These murderers ordered the prisoners of war of each squad to "visit," using this to coerce them not to demand repatriation. When the prisoners of war were forced to go, Zhang Zilong was already hanging there in a dying state. The flesh on his arms and back that had been tattooed with words had been dug out by the special agents with knives. The third "company commander" and the "health instructor" turned his body and shouted, "Look! Look! This is the fate of those who want to return to the mainland." The repatriated old fisherman Zhang Shuliang was also dragged into the tent at that time. As soon as he walked into the tent, he was so frightened that his legs went weak and he fell to the ground. Then, a prisoner of war from the "Juvenile Team" was dragged into the tent. As soon as he walked in, he screamed in fright and crawled on the ground crying.

After 9:00 a.m. that day, the special agents forced the prisoners of war to go to the tent to see. When the already repatriated old fisherman Sun Caisheng was dragged into the tent to see at that time, a nail was hammered into the top of Zhang Zilong's forehead, with a piece of tissue paper smeared on the nail. At this time, the "health instructor" took a sharp knife six or seven inches long with a white cloth wrapped around the handle and stabbed Zhang Zilong in the right temple. Zhang Zilong trembled all over in pain. The "health instructor" then cut off Zhang Zilong's right ear with a single stroke. Next, the special agent elements cut off Zhang Zilong's genitals. Then, the third "company commander" tightened the rope that bound Zhang Zilong's hands, causing his body to hang diagonally. He took a U.S. military bread knife printed with "U·S·" and cut off two pieces of meat from the place where Zhang Zilong's chest had been tattooed. Next, the "health instructor" also used a sharp knife to make several cuts on Zhang Zilong's stomach, cutting open a long slit. When the repatriated Chinese prisoner of war Li Wanqing was finally forced to go to see at that time, Zhang Zilong's body had been placed horizontally on the ground, with a shovel inserted into a long cut in his chest.
The "health instructor" was squatting there, using his hands to dig out his heart, liver, and intestines.

After the special agents dug out Zhang Zilong's heart, they cut it in half on the spot. The "health instructor" put half of the heart in a canned food container, then took it to the back of the kitchen, cooked it, and took it back to the "brigade headquarters" to eat. The other half of the heart was stir-fried in a round iron box and then eaten by special agents such as the third "company commander" and the "security captain." Zhang Zilong's liver and kidneys were also eaten separately by the special agents. The third "company commander" even personally took Zhang Zilong's liver to each squad and forced the prisoners of war to eat it. He threatened the prisoners of war, saying, "This person is going back to the mainland, and everyone has to eat his heart and liver. Whoever wants to go back will end up like him. Not only will we eat your heart and liver, but we will also eat your flesh." That day, the "health instructor" also strung together pieces of Zhang Zilong's meat and ears and took them to each squad to intimidate the prisoners of war.

After the special agent elements murdered Zhang Zilong, they buried his body in the tent of the third "company headquarters." After dinner that day, the third "company commander" assembled all the prisoners of war in the company to speak, threatening them, saying, "Zhang Zilong shouted 'Long live Chairman Mao!' during the parade. This is our enemy, so we killed him. Whoever wants to return to the country will end up like him! Remember, no one is allowed to reveal this secret. If anyone asks, say that he has climbed over the barbed wire and ran away. Whoever tells the truth will either have their heart dug out or be buried alive..."

(3) The Special Agents Destroyed the Body and Eliminated Evidence

On October 27th, the special agents already knew that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission was going to investigate the case of Zhang Zilong's murder. The main culprits in the murder of Zhang Zilong, "brigade commander" Zhang Yuwang and "education section chief" Shi Yun, went to "regiment commander" Ying Xiangyun's place to hold a meeting one after another to discuss ways to eliminate evidence. On the evening of the 28th, they dug out Zhang Zilong's body and buried it in the tent of the second "company headquarters." On the 29th, the special agents felt that this was not safe enough, so they dug out Zhang's body again, cut it into seven large pieces, burned it to ashes, and washed it away with water. The repatriated Chinese prisoner of war He Tianlong heard someone calling the "squad leader" of the ninth squad and the first "squad leader" Yang Furong and the third "squad leader" Zhang De out at about 10:00 p.m. on October 28th. At twelve o'clock, the two "squad leaders" returned once. He Tianlong asked them, "What did you go to do?" Yang Furong said, "Dig a cave and rebury Zhang Zilong's body."

The repatriated Chinese prisoner of war Cheng Liyou was originally forced to serve as a "security team member" in the POW camp, and he happened to be on guard duty on the evening of the 28th. At 1:00 a.m., he and another "security team member" walked outside the third "company headquarters" and saw smoke coming out of the tent and smelled a stench. Cheng Liyou looked through the tent seams and saw that the pit where Zhang Zilong had been buried in the past had been completely dug up, and a pair of trousers soaked in gasoline were burning by the side of the pit. Then, Liu Liu, the tenth "squad leader," dug out a large black garment from the pit and threw it in front of the third "company commander." The third "company commander" put this black garment in the middle aisle of the tent, poured gasoline on it, and burned it. Then, the special agents sprinkled some disinfectant powder in the pit and filled the pit with soil.

At noon on the 29th, the "security captain" ordered each squad of the "security team" to send two people with tools to move the body. Cheng Liyou's third squad also sent two people. At about 4:00 p.m., the two people returned and told Cheng Liyou that Zhang Zilong's body had been cut into seven pieces with a knife made from a gasoline barrel. At about 4:00 p.m. on the 29th, the returning old fisherman Zhang Shuliang saw the third "company commander" coming out of the "company headquarters," followed by the ninth "squad leader" Yang Zhida, who was carrying two heavy, smelly sacks, one large and one small, in his hand. A special agent element walking at the back was also carrying a sack. The three of them walked towards the kitchen together. The repatriated Chinese prisoner of war Chen Shunjin was also ordered to send rubber shoes to the kitchen because the special agents notified each squad to send two pairs of leather shoes or rubber shoes to the kitchen that morning. When he passed the kitchen's trash can, he found that the can was covered with a tattered blanket. He curiously lifted a corner of the blanket and saw that there were sacks inside, and gray-white bones and meat were exposed at the mouth of the sacks, emitting a foul smell. The repatriated Chinese prisoner of war Wang Zhide was originally a cook in the POW camp. At that time, he saw that the third "company commander," the "security captain," and the eighth "squad leader" had all come to the kitchen. The kitchen "squad leader" ordered two cooks to take down a pot. A special agent came in carrying a sack, took Zhang Zilong's two legs out of the sack, and put them in the stove. Then, he put the pot with water on the stove. The "security captain" stuffed rubber shoes into the stove and poured fuel oil on them to burn them. After burning for half an hour, the two legs were burned, and the special agent brought in another sack from outside. Later, the "security captain" ordered the cooks to go back and not allow them to watch any longer. At about 9:00 p.m., the repatriated Chinese prisoners of war Lu Kai and Wang Zhide heard someone using a shovel to rake out the ashes from the stove pit in the kitchen and heard the sound of water flushing the stove pit. After these murderers destroyed the body and eliminated evidence, they openly threatened the prisoners of war, saying, "When the Neutral Nations come to investigate, you are only allowed to say that Zhang Zilong has climbed over the barbed wire and ran away. Whoever tells the truth will not want to live."

The terrifying facts of Zhang Zilong's tragic death revealed by the repatriated Chinese prisoners of war once again exposed the U.S. side's shameful lies about prisoners of war "rejecting repatriation" and "no special agent elements" in the Neutral Nations-controlled camp, and proved that the U.S. side, in order to increase the prisoners of war's fear and make them afraid to demand repatriation, so as to forcibly detain them, adopted terror tactics far exceeding those of the German fascists. Obviously, the U.S. side is not qualified and has no reason to dispatch so-called "defense lawyers" to "defend" these murderers. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces must provide qualified Indian defense lawyers in accordance with the "scope of authority" and the provisions of the Geneva Conventions to allow the trial to proceed and to ensure that these murderers are punished as they deserve as soon as possible.

    张子龙被美方特务谋杀的经过
    【新华社开城二十二日电】美方企图派遣所谓“辩护律师”，在印度看管部队的军事法庭上为谋杀中国人民志愿军被俘人员张子龙的七名蒋匪特务凶犯“辩护”，其目的显然是企图掩饰这些杀人凶犯的滔天罪行，借以逃脱美方指使这些凶犯谋杀要求遣返的战俘的严重责任。
    但是，美方特务谋杀张子龙案件的铁证如山，决非美方任何抵赖手段所能推翻。下面就是在中立国遣返委员会调查张子龙被谋杀事件时，当场出来作证和要求遣返的二十八名我方被俘人员所揭露的美方特务谋杀张子龙的经过。
    （一）张子龙坚决要求遣返受到残酷迫害
    张子龙是江苏人，二十六岁，原为中国人民志愿军某部上士，一九五一年被俘以后，一直住在釜山战俘病院。一九五二年七月被送到济州岛摹瑟浦第三战俘营，一九五三年九月十三日被移交中立国遣返委员会看管以后，在第二十八号营场三中队十一小队一班。张子龙一直坚决要求遣返回国，但是被美方用暴力强迫列为所谓“拒绝遣返”的战俘。他在去年九月和十月在济州岛上时，曾三次企图逃出拘留所谓“拒绝遣返”战俘的战俘营，到拘留直接遣返战俘的第八号战俘营去，但是都被美军岗哨抓住，押送回原营场。他第三次被抓回营场后，就被押到二中队七小队囚禁了约二十天。后来，他又被调到三中队四小队。该小队“小队长”李直启对他施行种种虐待，每天罚他做各种苦役，还常常以衣服钮扣没有扣好之类作为藉口，对他施行毒打和各种刑罚。今年四月间，蒋匪特务在美方指使之下在战俘营里用暴力进行“清查回国分子”的时候，张子龙曾被特务分子毒打。停战以后两三天，特务们又强迫在他的胸前和背上刺上国民党旗帜、党徽和两行“反共抗俄”共八个字，在他的左腕上刺上
  “回台湾”三个大字。
    九月十八日上午，战俘移交给中立国遣返委员会看管的过程中，第二十八号营场的特务集合全大队的战俘强迫他们辱骂我方观察代表，张子龙不愿出去。三中队的“中队长”强迫他出帐篷骂毛主席，他立即回答道：“我不骂。”“中队长”就打了他两下耳光，并且命令特务分子用木棒毒打他，然后罚他头上顶一碗水，两眼直视太阳，两手再平举一个盛满水的水盆，一共举了两个钟点。每当他力不能支手软水溢时，特务分子就用木棍乱打他。第二天上午，特务分子又对他施行同样的酷刑达二个多小时，并且罚他两天没有饭吃。后来，特务们几乎每天都要问他一次“你回那里去？”张子龙每一次都不回答；特务们强迫他像背书一样背诵“回台湾！回台湾！”他也不肯说，特务们就毒打他，并且处罚他脱光衣服，两腿半弯曲，站了两个整夜，白天也不准他睡觉，不给他吃饭。
    （二）张子龙被谋杀的经过
    十月二日上午九时许，第二十八号营场的特务强迫战俘举行反对印度看管部队的游行示威。张子龙始终一声也不喊，也不摇旗。三“中队长”立即跑过来连续三次命令他骂毛主席，他都拒绝不骂。特务分子就把他拉进一个帐篷里去，把他打了一顿。当天下午四时许，张子龙被押到了三“中队部”去。天黑以后，张子龙被两脚两手反捆在一起，吊在帐篷杆上。三“中队长”陈福生、“卫生指导员”、“警备队长”吴宝山和几个“小队长”轮流毒打他，打得他满面是血。尽管特务一再施以毒打，张子龙仍然坚不屈服，高喊“毛主席万岁”。当天深夜十二时左右，张子龙被抬回十一小队帐篷，他全身衣服都被撕烂，头上身上很多地方被打伤，鲜血直流。
    十月三日天刚亮，特务们又把他架到了三“中队部”去。当天早饭以后，张子龙的双手被用帐篷绳子捆了起来，吊在靠三“中队部”帐篷东门口的中梁上。陷于半昏迷状态的张子龙不时垂下头来，三“中队长”就用半截旗杆敲他的头，要他把头抬起来。后来，三“中队长”就把他的双脚也捆上吊了起来。这样，张子龙就被背朝上，肚朝下地平吊起来，离地约四尺。这时，另一个特务段文贤拿了一卷国民党报纸和牛皮纸来，点着火烧他的肚子。一卷纸烧完以后，三“中队长”又在他的短裤上倒上一小瓶汽油，段文贤就用打火机点着火，顿时，火就在他的下身烧了起来。由于他痛得全身剧烈抖动，火就四溅燃烧。烧过以后，他的臀部、腰部和背上，烧得皮肉开裂，发黑发紫。三“中队长”又将一张洒上汽油的纸，放在张子龙的背上，然后点着了火，烧得帐篷里外充满了一股难闻的焦臭。这些杀人凶犯就命令各小队的战俘去“参观”，借此胁迫他们不得要求遣返。战俘们被迫去看时，张子龙已经奄奄一息地吊在那里。他手臂上、背上刺过字的肉已被特务分子用刀子挖掉。三“中队长”、“卫生指导员”转动着他的身子叫喊道：“看！看！这就是要回国的下场。”遣返归来的老渔民张书良在那时也被拉到帐篷里去。他一走进帐篷，就吓得两腿发软倒在地上。接着，又有一个“少年队”的战俘被拉到帐篷里去。他一走进去，就吓得大叫，爬在地上哭起来。
    当天九点钟后，特务们又强迫战俘们到帐篷里去看。已经遣返归来的老渔民孙才生在那时被拖到帐篷里去看时，张子龙的脑门顶上被钉了一根铁钉，钉上面糊了一张手纸。这时，“卫生指导员”拿着一把六、七寸长、柄上缠白布的尖刀，向张子龙右面的太阳穴上刺了一刀，张子龙痛得全身抖动了一下。“卫生指导员”又顺手把张子龙的右耳一刀割了下来。接着，特务分子又把张子龙的生殖器割掉。然后，三“中队长”将捆住张子龙双手的绳子抽紧了一些，使他的身体斜吊着。他就拿着一把印有“U·S·”字样的美国军用切面包刀，在张子龙胸前刺过字的地方割下两片肉。接着，“卫生指导员”也用尖刀在张子龙的肚子上划了几刀，剖开一条长长的口子。遣返归来的我方被俘人员李万青在那时最后被强迫去看时，张子龙的身体已被横放在地上，胸口上一条长长的刀口里插着一把铁锹。
  “卫生指导员”正蹲在那里用手把他的心、肝、肠挖出来。
    特务把张子龙的心挖出来后，当场就割成两半，“卫生指导员”把半片心装在一个罐头筒里，然后拿到伙房后面煮熟后拿回“大队部”吃掉了。另外半片心被放在圆铁盒子里炒熟后，被三“中队长”、“警备队长”等特务们吃掉了。张子龙的肝和肾脏也被特务们分开吃掉。三“中队长”还亲自拿着张子龙的肝到各小队去强迫战俘们吃。他威胁战俘说：“这个人是要回大陆的，谁都得吃他的心肝。谁要回去就和他一样，不但吃你的心肝，连你的肉也要吃了。”当天，“卫生指导员”还把张子龙的一块块肉和耳朵穿成一串，拿到各小队去威吓战俘。
    特务分子谋杀张子龙以后，就把他的尸体埋在三“中队部”的帐篷里。当天晚饭以后，三“中队长”集合全中队的战俘讲话，威胁他们说：“张子龙在游行时还喊‘毛主席万岁！’这就是咱们的敌人，所以把他杀了。谁想回国，就跟他一样下场！你们记着，谁也不许暴露这个秘密，要是有人问，就说他已经爬铁丝网跑了；谁说了实话，不是挖你的心，就是把你活埋……。”
    （三）特务毁尸灭迹、消灭罪证
    十月二十七日，特务们就已经知道了中立国遣返委员会要对张子龙被谋杀的案件进行调查的消息。谋杀张子龙的主要凶犯，“大队长”张宇旺和
  “教育股长”施云曾先后去“联队长”应祥云处开会，商讨消灭罪证的办法。二十八日晚上，他们就将张子龙的尸体挖出来，埋在二“中队部”的帐篷里。二十九日，特务觉得这样还不保险，又把张的尸体挖出来切成七大块烧成灰烬，用水冲走。遣返归来的我方被俘人员何天隆在十月二十八日晚十时左右，曾听到有人来叫九小队的“小队长”和一
  “班长”杨富荣、三“班长”张德出去。十二点钟，两个“班长”回来了一次，何天隆问他们“干甚么去了”，杨富荣说：“挖个地洞把张子龙的尸体重新埋掉。”
    遣返归来的我方被俘人员程立有原先在战俘营内被迫充当“警备队员”，二十八日晚上正好轮到他站岗。在深夜一时，他和另外一个“警备队员”走到三“中队部”的外面时，看见帐篷里有一股烟冒出来，还闻到一股臭味。程立有从帐篷缝里望见，过去埋张子龙的土坑已经全部挖开，一条浇了汽油的裤子正在坑边燃烧。接着，十“小队长”刘六从坑里挖出来一件很大的黑衣服，扔在三“中队长”的面前。三“中队长”就把这件黑衣服放在帐篷中间的走道上，浇上汽油烧掉。然后，特务们撒了些消毒粉在坑里，用土填平了坑。
    二十九日中午，“警备队长”又命令“警备队”每个班派两个人带了工具去搬移尸体。程立有所在的三班也派了两个人去。约在下午四时，这两个人回来了，他们告诉程立有说，张子龙的尸体被用汽油桶磨的刀切成七块。二十九日下午四时许，归来的老渔民张书良又看见三“中队长”从“中队部”走了出来，九“小队长”杨志达跟在后面，他的手里提着一大一小两个沉甸甸的臭气很大的麻袋。走在最后面的一个特务分子也提着一个麻袋。他们三个一起向伙房走去。遣返归来的我方被俘人员陈顺金当时也奉命把胶鞋送到伙房去，因为当天上午特务们通知每个小队送两双皮鞋或胶鞋到伙房去。他路过伙房的垃圾桶时，发现桶上盖了一床破毛毯，他好奇地掀开毛毯的一角看了一下，看见里面放着麻袋，麻袋口上露着灰白色的骨头和肉，发出一股难闻的臭味。遣返归来的我方被俘人员王志德原在战俘营内当炊事员，当时他看见三“中队长”、“警备队长”和八“小队长”都到了伙房里来。伙房“小队长”就指挥两个炊事员把一口锅子取下来。一个特务提着麻袋进来，从麻袋里取出张子龙的两条腿子放进灶内，然后又把添了水的锅子放在灶上。“警备队长”就把胶鞋塞进灶内，浇上火油烧起来。烧了半小时以后，两条腿子烧完了，特务又从外面搬进来一麻袋。后来，“警备队长”命令炊事员都回去，不准他们再看下去。大约晚上九时，遣返归来的我方被俘人员卢凯和王志德在那时都听到有人在伙房里用圆锹扒出灶坑里的灰，并且听到用水冲灶坑的声音。这些杀人凶犯们在毁尸灭迹以后，公开威胁战俘说：“中立国来调查的时候，只准说张子龙已经爬铁丝网跑了。谁要是说了真话，谁就别想活。”
    遣返归来的我方被俘人员所揭露的张子龙惨遭毒手的恐怖事实，再次揭穿了美方所谓战俘“拒绝遣返”和中立国看管营场里“没有特务分子”的可耻谎言，并且证明美方为了增加战俘的疑惧心理，使他们不敢要求遣返，以便强迫扣留他们，采取了远远超过德国法西斯的恐怖手段。显然，美方没有资格也没有理由派遣所谓“辩护律师”为这些杀人凶犯“辩护”。中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队必须根据“职权范围”和日内瓦公约的规定提供合格的印度辩护律师，使审判得以进行，使这些杀人凶犯早日受到应得的惩罚。
