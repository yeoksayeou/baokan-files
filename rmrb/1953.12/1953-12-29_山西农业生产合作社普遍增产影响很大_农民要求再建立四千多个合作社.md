[Reported by this newspaper] The agricultural production cooperatives in Shanxi Province have generally seen significant increases in harvest yields this year. Ninety-eight percent of the cooperatives have an average output exceeding that of local mutual aid teams. Educated by this fact, the broad masses of farmers in Shanxi Province are actively requesting to join agricultural production cooperatives. According to current statistics, farmers in various counties have requested the establishment of a total of 4,600 new agricultural production cooperatives, more than double the number this year.

This year, Shanxi Province established a total of 2,242 agricultural production cooperatives, including the 546 established before last year. A total of 52,822 farm households participated in the agricultural production cooperatives, accounting for 1.6 percent of the total number of farm households in the province. Among them, in counties with the most agricultural production cooperatives, such as Wuxiang County, the number of farm households participating in agricultural production cooperatives has accounted for 12 percent of the total number of farm households in the county. In Pingshun County, the number of farm households participating in agricultural production cooperatives has accounted for 11.5 percent of the total number of farm households in the county. More than 98,000 men and women laborers in the province have joined cooperatives. The total area of land included in the cooperatives is more than 879,000 mu.

This year, the harvest yield of crops from agricultural production cooperatives in the province was higher than that of individual farmers and mutual aid teams. The total output of grain crops from agricultural production cooperatives in the province this year exceeded the total output of last year by 27.6 percent. The unit area yield averaged 203 jin per mu this year, an increase of 44 jin per mu compared with last year, exceeding the average yield per mu of ordinary perennial mutual aid teams in the area this year by 21 percent, and exceeding the output of ordinary individual farmers in the area by 38 percent. The total output of cotton fields in agricultural production cooperatives in the province this year was 5,112,000 jin (seed cotton), exceeding the total output of last year by 20 percent, with an average yield of 189 jin per mu, an increase of 38 jin per mu compared with last year, exceeding the average yield per mu in the province this year by 35.8 percent. Among these agricultural production cooperatives, many cooperatives have created even more outstanding achievements. For example, the 345 mu of land in the Feng Haike Agricultural Production Cooperative in Huguan County yielded an average harvest of 533 jin and 12 liang of grain per mu, creating a model of comprehensive bumper harvests. Their output exceeded the output before the War of Resistance Against Japan by 390.5 percent, increased by 197.6 percent compared to when they were still a mutual aid team in 1950, and exceeded the average yield per mu in the county this year by one time.

In 1953, agricultural production cooperatives, due to the unified allocation of labor, not only created outstanding achievements in agricultural production, but also achieved great success in developing sideline occupations, developing forestry and animal husbandry in areas with suitable conditions, and other aspects. The sideline income of agricultural production cooperatives in the province was 10.8 billion yuan, accounting for about 8 percent of the total income. The largest was the Changzhi Jinggedao Agricultural Production Cooperative, whose sideline income was 300 million yuan. The Chenjiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Datong County built four shelterbelts this year, covering approximately 400 mu, with a survival rate of over 98 percent, and the income from animal husbandry was worth approximately 360,000 jin of grain. The Wuhou Pear Agricultural Production Cooperative in Pingshun County had an income of 51 million yuan from fruit trees alone, accounting for half of the total income of the cooperative. The Li Shunda Agricultural Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative, based on the original afforestation by the masses, sowed seeds on 360 mu of barren mountains this year, planted more than 7,000 scattered trees, and planted more than 3,000 fruit trees, and has begun to change the face of the bare mountains.

The actual income of each member household in the agricultural production cooperatives has generally increased. Among the 52,822 member households, 50,181 households exceeded or were equivalent to last year's income, accounting for 95 percent of the total member households. In the Changzhi area, there were 392 cooperatives where the actual income of the members of each household exceeded that of last year. For example, the agricultural production cooperative in Xiaguihua Village, Licheng County, with a total of 21 households, had 5 households with more than 2,000 jin of grain compared to last year, 12 households with more than 1,000 jin to 1,500 jin, 3 households with more than 500 jin to 800 jin, and 1 household with more than 410 jin. In agricultural production cooperatives, both households with little land and a lot of labor and households with a lot of land and little labor generally increased their income, and the actual income of widows, widowers, orphans, and the childless also increased. Only 2,641 member households in the province had incomes slightly lower than last year, accounting for 5 percent of the total member households in the province. The reasons for the decrease in income of these households were that some suffered severe disasters, and some were due to the main labor force leaving. However, their income was generally higher than that of local mutual aid teams and individual farmers.

Due to the large increase in production of agricultural production cooperatives and the increase in the actual income of each member, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of members is very high, and they are actively consolidating the existing achievements. The success of agricultural production cooperatives has driven the development of the entire mutual aid and cooperation movement in the province. The number of farm households participating in mutual aid teams has increased from 40 percent of farm households in the spring to 51 percent. In some of the more advanced old areas, it has increased from 65 percent to about 80 percent. At the same time, the form of mutual aid teams has also been improved. For example, in Pingshun County, perennial mutual aid teams have accounted for 53 percent of all organized farm households. At present, farmers in the province have launched a surge of requests to participate in and build new agricultural production cooperatives. In order to prepare for the large-scale establishment of agricultural production cooperatives next year, Shanxi Province has begun training cadres for the construction of cooperatives. The province initially plans to train approximately 20,000 cadres for the construction of cooperatives, including county and district cadres leading agricultural production cooperatives, as well as the heads, deputy heads, production team leaders of agricultural production cooperatives, the secretaries of the CCP village branches, and the accountants of agricultural production cooperatives.

    山西农业生产合作社普遍增产影响很大
    农民要求再建立四千多个合作社
      【本报讯】山西省二千多个农业生产合作社今年的收获量一般都显著增加，百分之九十八的社平均产量都超过了当地互助组的产量。山西省广大农民在这一事实的教育下，积极要求参加农业生产合作社。据目前统计，各县农民要求新建的农业生产合作社总数已达四千六百个，超出今年一倍还多。
    今年山西全省共办了二千二百四十二个农业生产合作社，其中包括去年以前办的五百四十六个。参加农业生产合作社的农户，共五万二千八百二十二户，占全省农户总数的百分之一点六。其中农业生产合作社最多的县，如武乡县参加农业生产合作社的农户已占全县农户总数的百分之十二，平顺县参加农业生产合作社的农户已占全县农户总数的百分之十一点五，全省入社的男女劳力有九万八千多个。入社的土地共有八十七万九千多亩。
    今年全省农业生产合作社农作物的收获量，比个体农民和互助组都高。今年全省农业生产合作社的粮食作物总产量超过去年总产量百分之二十七点六。单位面积产量今年每亩平均为二百零三斤，较去年每亩增产四十四斤，超过今年当地一般常年互助组每亩平均产量百分之二十一，超过当地一般个体农民产量百分之三十八。今年全省农业生产合作社的棉田总产量共五百一十一万二千斤（籽棉），超过去年总产量百分之二十，每亩平均产量一百八十九斤，较去年每亩增产三十八斤，超过今年全省每亩平均产量百分之三十五点八。在这些农业生产合作社中，有不少的社创造了更为优异的成绩。例如壶关县冯海科农业生产合作社的三百四十五亩土地，得到了每亩平均五百三十三斤十二两粮食的收获，创造了全面丰产的范例。他们的产量超过了抗日战争前的产量百分之三百九十点五，比一九五零年还是互助组的时候，提高了百分之一百九十七点六，超过了今年全县每亩平均产量一倍。
    一九五三年农业生产合作社由于统一调配劳动力，不但在农业生产方面创造了卓越的成就，同时在发展副业、有条件地区发展林业和牧畜业等各个方面，都取得了很大成绩。全省农业生产合作社的副业收入为一百零八亿元，约占总收入的百分之八左右。最多的是长治荆圪倒农业生产合作社，它的副业收入是三亿元。大同县陈家庄农业生产合作社，今年营造防风林带四条，约四百余亩，成活率达百分之九十八以上，畜牧的收入约值三十六万斤粮食。平顺县武侯梨农业生产合作社单是果树的收入，就有五千一百万元，占全社总收入的一半。李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社在群众原有植树造林的基础上，今年在荒山播种三百六十亩，零星植树七千余株，栽植果树三千余株，已开始改变着童山秃岭的面貌。
    农业生产合作社各个社员户的实际收入一般都增加了。在五万二千八百二十二个社员户中，有五万零一百八十一户，超过去年或相当于去年的收入，占总社员户的百分之九十五。长治专区有三百九十二个社，社员的实际收入户户超过了去年。如黎城县下桂花村的农业生产合作社，共二十一户，比去年多收粮食二千斤者五户，多收一千斤到一千五百斤者十二户，多收五百斤到八百斤者三户，多收四百一十斤者一户。农业生产合作社中，不论是地少劳力多的户或地多劳力少的户一般都增加了收入，社内的鳏、寡、孤、独的实际收入也有增加。全省只有二千六百四十一个社员户稍低于去年的收入，占全省总社员户的百分之五。这些户收入减少的原因，有的是因为遭受了严重灾害，有的是因为主要劳力外出的原故。但一般也都比当地互助组和个体农民的收入为多。
    由于农业生产合作社的大量增产和各个社员实际收入的增加，广大社员的热情很高，正在积极地巩固已有的成绩。农业生产合作社的成功，带动了全省整个互助合作运动的发展，全省参加互助组的农户已由春季占农户的百分之四十发展到百分之五十一。一部分较先进的老区则由百分之六十五发展到百分之八十左右。同时，互助组的形式也有了新的提高。如平顺县的常年互助组，已占到整个组织起来农户的百分之五十三。目前该省农民已掀起了要求参加和新建农业生产合作社的热潮。为了准备明年大批建立农业生产合作社，山西省开始进行建社干部的训练工作。全省初步计划训练建社干部约二万余人，其中包括领导农业生产合作社的县、区干部及农业生产合作社的社长、副社长、生产队长、中共村支部书记和农业生产合作社的会计等。
