Fushun Petroleum Factory No. 1 Completes Annual Production Plan Ahead of Schedule

Dearest Chairman Mao:

Under the correct leadership of the Party and yourself, all employees of our Petroleum Factory No. 1 completed the 1953 annual production plan seventeen days ahead of schedule on December 14th, achieving 100.2% of the total production value. By the end of November, we had completed 131% of the profit to be turned over to the state. The average cost from January to November was reduced by 9.78% compared to the national plan. Of the factory's eleven major products, ten have already completed the annual national plan ahead of schedule, ranging from eleven to forty days.

This year, based on discussing the national plan and formulating advanced production plans, all our employees strengthened plan management, implemented operational plans, and launched daily progress competitions, greatly improving the comprehensiveness and balance of our production. In September, we responded to the call of the Party and the government to increase production and practice economy. Based on tapping potential and finding breakthroughs, we formulated a plan to increase production and practice economy, and further launched a competition to increase production and practice economy, with the implementation of operational plans and the promotion of advanced experience as the main content. During the competition, we completed the autumn overhaul task ahead of schedule and solved key problems such as increasing the recovery rate of No. 1 light oil. In particular, the study of the general line and general tasks in November greatly promoted the current production work.

Dearest Chairman Mao: Our achievements are still very small, and there are still many shortcomings. We will never be satisfied with the achievements we have made. We will deepen the campaign to increase production and practice economy to welcome the second year of the motherland's Five-Year Plan.

With best regards,
　　All Employees of Fushun Petroleum Factory No. 1

    抚顺石油一厂提前完成全年生产计划敬爱的毛主席：
    在党和您的正确领导下，我们石油一厂全体职工在十二月十四日提前十七天完成了一九五三年全年生产计划，完成生产总值百分之一○○点二。到十一月底完成了上缴利润百分之一百三十一。一月至十一月的成本平均比国家计划降低百分之九点七八。全厂十一种主要产品，到目前为止，已有十种提前十一天到四十天完成了全年国家计划。
    我们全体职工今年在讨论国家计划制订先进生产计划的基础上，加强了计划管理，贯彻了作业计划，开展了日进度竞赛，大大提高了我们生产的全面性和均衡性。九月份，我们响应了党和政府增产节约的号召，在挖潜力、找窍门的基础上制订了增产节约计划，进一步开展了以贯彻作业计划，推广先进经验为主要内容的增产节约竞赛。在竞赛中，提前完成了秋季检修任务，解决了提高一号轻油收率等关键问题。特别是十一月份结合总路线总任务的学习，更大大推动了当前生产工作。
    敬爱的毛主席：我们的成绩还是很微小的，还存在着很多缺点，我们决不满足于既得成绩。我们要把增产节约竞赛再深入一步，来迎接祖国五年计划的第二年。
    此致敬礼　抚顺石油一厂全体职工
