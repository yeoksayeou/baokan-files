Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 14th: The US side’s explanation work for US POWs in Songgok-ri has been suspended for two days because they refuse to grant the POWs the opportunity to fully hear the explanations. The US side originally intended to completely ignore the one hundred-plus South Korean POWs who had not yet heard the explanations, and instead switch to explaining to US and British POWs today. But their plan did not materialize. US and British POWs did not come out to hear the explanations today, and like the South Korean POWs, they demanded the right to hear full explanations.

The demands of the South Korean and American POWs are fully expressed in their two memorandums to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on the 13th. The South Korean POWs' memorandum, which is thirty pages long, stated that they are willing to come out to hear the explanations if the Syngman Rhee’s explanation personnel agree to provide explanations to them. The American POWs, in their four-page memorandum, support the views of the South Korean POWs. They said that they must receive thorough and complete explanations, because listening to explanations is their right. They protested to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission about the Syngman Rhee explanation personnel arbitrarily interrupting explanations, insulting POWs, and the impolite behavior of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's subsidiary bodies forcibly dragging POWs out of tents.

These demands of the South Korean and American/British POWs are completely legitimate. In the past ten days or so, the US side's explanation work in Songgok-ri has been carried out in a very quiet and unobstructed environment. This is completely the opposite of the situation in Dongchang-ri, where the Korean-Chinese side's explanation work was obstructed and sabotaged by US secret agents. However, after several consecutive days of POWs not applying for repatriation, the Syngman Rhee explanation personnel not only did not improve their explanation methods and tell the POWs more about their peaceful life back home, but suddenly became impatient and irritable. They refused to tell the POWs anything about their life back home. POWs were taken away three to five minutes after entering the tent, turning the explanation tent into "a busy barbershop." They called the POWs "bastards" and said, "What does it matter if you don't go back? What do three hundred and twenty people mean to the Republic of Korea?" In this situation, the right to listen to explanations granted to POWs by the armistice agreement has been violated. It is reasonable for the POWs to demand a full explanation to protect their rights, and the US side has no reason to refuse. Chairman Thimayya of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission also believed on the 12th: "It is not that the POWs want to stop the explanation work, they are willing to listen to the explanations. But they just want clarification on issues related to their repatriation."

The US side's refusal of the POWs' legitimate demands proves that they are afraid of continuing the explanation work. What they are concerned about is clearly not the POWs' repatriation rights, but the failure of their "cold war" propaganda because no POWs are applying for repatriation.

While refusing to explain to South Korean POWs in Songgok-ri, the US side continues to do its best to undermine the Korean-Chinese side's explanation work in Dongchang-ri. As US representative Dean unilaterally interrupted the bilateral talks on the political conference issue, the Lee and Chiang secret agents in Dongchang-ri became even more emboldened in preventing POWs from coming out to hear the explanations. The explanation work that the Korean-Chinese side originally planned to carry out today for 250 Korean People's Army prisoners of war could not be carried out as a result. This is the twenty-eighth day since the fifth suspension of explanation work.

### 南朝鲜和美国战俘送交中立国遣返委员会两份备忘录  要求美方保证他们充分听取解释的权利

    南朝鲜和美国战俘送交中立国遣返委员会两份备忘录
    要求美方保证他们充分听取解释的权利
    【新华社开城十四日电】美方对松谷里的美方战俘的解释工作已经停顿了两天，因为他们拒绝给予战俘以充分听取解释的机会。美方本来想根本抛开一百多名尚未听取解释的南朝鲜战俘不管，而在今天改对美、英战俘进行解释。但是他们的计划没有实现。美、英战俘今天没有出来听取解释，他们和南朝鲜战俘一样要求有听取充分解释的权利。
    南朝鲜战俘和美国战俘的要求充分表现在他们在十三日给中立国遣返委员会的两份备忘录中。南朝鲜战俘的长达三十页的备忘录说，他们是愿意出来听取解释的，如果李承晚的解释人员答应向他们进行解释的话。美国战俘在他们的长达四页的备忘录中支持南朝鲜战俘的观点。他们说，他们必须得到彻底而且完全的解释，因为听取解释是他们的权利。他们向中立国遣返委员会抗议李承晚解释人员任意中断解释、辱骂战俘，以及要中立国遣返委员会附属机构把战俘用武力拖出帐篷的无礼行为。
    南朝鲜战俘和美、英战俘的这种要求是完全正当的。在过去十多天中，美方在松谷里的解释工作，是在十分安静、毫无阻碍的情况下进行的。这和朝中方面在东场里的解释工作受到美方特务的阻挠和破坏的情形，完全相反。但是在接连几天战俘都没有申请遣返以后，李承晚解释人员不但没有因此改进他们的解释方法，告诉战俘更多关于他们回家过和平生活的事情，反而突然变得暴躁和不耐烦起来。他们不肯告诉战俘一点儿他们回家过活有关的事情，战俘进入帐篷三、五分钟就被带走，把解释帐篷弄得“像忙碌的理发店一样”。他们骂战俘是“杂种”，并且说：“你们不回去有什么关系？三百二十多人对大韩民国算得了什么？”在这种情形下，停战协定所赋予战俘的听取解释的权利已经遭到侵犯。战俘为了保障他们的权利而要求听取充分的解释，这是合情合理的，美方没有任何理由加以拒绝。中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅也在十二日认为：“并不是战俘们想使解释工作停顿，他们是愿意听取解释的。但他们就是要求澄清有关他们遣返的问题。”
    美方拒绝战俘的正当要求，证明他们害怕继续进行解释工作。他们所关心的显然并不是战俘的遣返权利，而是他们的“冷战”宣传因为没有战俘申请遣返而遭到的失败。
    美方一方面在松谷里拒绝对南朝鲜战俘进行解释工作，另一方面又继续竭力破坏东场里朝中方面的解释工作。随着美国代表迪安片面中断了关于政治会议问题的双方会谈，东场里的李、蒋特务更加有恃无恐地不许战俘出来听取解释。朝中方面原定今天对二百五十名朝鲜人民军被俘人员进行的解释工作，因此未能进行。这已经是第五次解释工作停顿以来的第二十八天了。
