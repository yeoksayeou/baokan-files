    Heilongjiang Farmers Encouraged by the General Line
    Actively Sell Grain and Prepare to Expand Production
    [Report from this newspaper] Under the leadership of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee, the province has vigorously conducted propaganda and education on the General Line and grain purchase policy among farmers.
    According to statistics from 39 counties and 281 districts across the province, over 22,000 district and village cadres have studied the General Line in training classes organized by the county Party committees. These cadres are now conducting propaganda among the vast number of farmers across the province. Through this propaganda and education, all cadres and the vast number of farmers have received preliminary education. They not only see the present but also recognize the bright and far-reaching future of the country's socialist industrialization, thereby enhancing their political awareness and revolutionary enthusiasm. Cadres who previously could not see the socialist prospects now say, "The General Line illuminates the path, there is hope!" Older cadres also say, "We can't declare ourselves too old, we must work one year as ten!" After recognizing the future, the farmers all say, "Now we know which road to take."
    Encouraged by the General Line, the vast number of cadres and farmers have greatly enhanced their enthusiasm for work and production. "Sell surplus grain to the state and support the state's socialist industrial construction!" This has become the action slogan of patriotic farmers. Farmers are actively selling their surplus grain, adding carts and horses, purchasing new farm tools, and preparing to expand production. There are many such examples: In Lingxia Village, Baicheng County, after the farmers sold their surplus grain to the state, they immediately signed a contract with the village supply and marketing cooperative to buy 24 horses, 47 cattle, 2 carts, 120 sheep, 67 pigs, 3,865 feet of cloth, and 13,000 jin of cotton. The total cost was 170 million yuan, accounting for 42% of the total grain sales revenue. After propagating the General Line in Tongxing Village, Longjiang County, which has only 334 agricultural households, the farmers in the entire village sold 1,312 tons of surplus grain to the state in one go, and bought 21 horses and 25 carts. As of December 3, farmers across the province had completed 50% of the province's grain purchase task. Some counties have already overfulfilled the grain purchase task. For example, Nenjiang County has overfulfilled its task by 400 tons in just over a month.
    While carrying out grain purchase work, economic departments such as the Provincial Federation of Cooperatives and department stores have prepared a large number of daily necessities and production tools such as ploughshares, rope sets, carts, and horses to meet the needs of farmers to expand production and improve their lives. During the grain purchase period alone, the province has supplied farmers with 6,822 cattle, 276 horses, 900 sheep, 4,880 carts, 9,915 cubic meters of wood, more than 759,000 bolts of various cloths, and 2,517 tons of cotton. Recently, the Provincial Federation of Cooperatives has shipped in a large number of wood and livestock to meet the needs of farmers.
    The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China once again demonstrated the Party's leadership in leading the propaganda and education of the General Line and grain purchase policy. At the beginning of the propaganda work, the Provincial Party Committee put forward the policy of steady progress. The Provincial Party Committee pointed out that the key to the success or failure of the work lies in educating Party members and educating farmers. It requires that each county conduct pilot projects and train cadres before carrying out grain purchase work; each economic department must do a good job in supply work; and the grain department must do a good job in transportation, acceptance, and storage. Before the counties trained cadres, Feng Jixin, secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, and more than 30 leading cadres went to the pilot projects to explore experiences and guide the propaganda work in various counties in a timely manner. On December 4, the Provincial Party Committee held another enlarged meeting, grasped the key to the propaganda of the General Line and the grain purchase policy, arranged the future work of comprehensively and deeply propagating the General Line and the grain purchase policy, and instructed Party committees at all levels to implement the policy of "strengthening leadership, actively and steadily progressing, and spreading out in batches"; prevent complacency; give play to the role of collective leadership; and strengthen the organization and discipline in the work. The Provincial Party Committee decided to organize forces to go to the lower levels to check and inspect and provide timely guidance for this work. At the same time, the Provincial Party Committee identified several key links to be grasped in the comprehensive and in-depth propaganda of the General Line and the grain purchase policy: First, vigorously promote the General Line, implement the Party's policies, prevent impatience and coercive orders; strengthen the consolidated unity of poor and middle peasants; grain purchase work must be closely integrated with production, and mutual assistance and cooperation must be promoted; the economic work should be closely combined with the political work, reversing the one-sided thinking of some economic work cadres who "emphasize cities over rural areas, and emphasize consumer goods over means of production" in terms of material supply. The Provincial Party Committee emphasized that it should strengthen the Party's activities in propaganda work; it required that rural Party members do a good job in studying and propagating the General Line; they should take the lead in selling surplus grain to the state and persuade others; they should take the lead in using the money from grain sales to expand production; and Party members are not allowed to engage in speculation and profiteering. This arrangement of the Provincial Party Committee will enable the province to comprehensively and deeply promote the work of propagating the General Line and the grain purchase policy to continue to deepen.

    黑龙江农民受到总路线的鼓舞
    踊跃售粮准备扩大生产
    【本报讯】黑龙江省在省委领导下大张旗鼓地向全省农民进行了总路线和购粮政策的宣传教育。
    根据全省三十九个县、二百八十一个区的统计：全省已有二万二千多个区村干部在县委举办的训练班学习了总路线。现在正在通过这些干部向全省广大农民进行宣传。经过这次宣传教育，全体干部和广大农民受到了初步的教育，他们不仅看到眼前，也认清了国家的社会主义工业化的光明远大前途，提高了政治觉悟和革命积极性。过去看不清社会主义远景的干部，现在说：“总路线照亮了路，有奔头了。”年岁大的干部也说：“不能报老了，要拿一年当十年来干！”农民们认清了前途以后都说：“这回知道走哪条路啦。”
    在总路线鼓舞下的广大干部和农民，大大提高了工作和生产热情。“将余粮卖给国家，支援国家社会主义工业建设！”这已成了爱国农民的行动口号。农民们正在踊跃卖出自己手中的余粮，添车买马，购置新农具，准备扩大生产。这类事例很多：白城县岭下村，农民将余粮卖给国家以后，当场就和村供销合作社订立了合同，买马二十四匹，牛四十七头，车二辆，羊一百二十只，猪六十七口，布三千八百六十五尺，棉花一万三千斤。共合款一亿七千万元，占卖粮款总数的百分之四十二。龙江县在一个只有三百三十四个农业户的同兴村宣传总路线之后，全村农民一次就把一千三百一十二吨余粮卖给国家，买进二十一匹马、二十五辆车。截至十二月三日，全省农民已完成该省购粮任务百分之五十。有些县已超额完成购粮任务。如嫩江县，在一个多月的时间内已超额四百吨完成了任务。
    在购粮工作的同时，省联社、百货公司等经济部门，准备了大批日用品和犁铧绳套、车辆马匹等生产用具，以满足农民扩大生产和改善生活的要求。全省仅在购粮期中，已供给农民六千八百二十二头牛，二百七十六匹马，九百只羊；四千八百八十辆车，九千九百一十五立方公尺木材；各种布疋七十五万九千多疋和二千五百一十七吨棉花。最近省联社又运到大批木材、牲畜，以满足农民的需要。
    中共黑龙江省委在领导总路线和购粮政策宣传教育工作中，再一次显示了党的领导力量。宣传工作一开始，省委就提出稳步前进的方针。省委指出：工作好坏的关键在于教育党员和教育农民。要求各县在进行购粮工作之前，做好试点，集训干部工作；各经济部门要做好供应工作；粮食部门要做好运输、验收、保管工作。在各县集训干部之前，省委书记冯纪新和三十多个领导干部，分头深入试点，摸索经验，及时指导各县宣传工作。十二月四日，省委又召开了扩大会议，抓住宣传总路线和购粮政策的关键，布置了今后全面深入宣传总路线和购粮政策的工作，指示各级党委，要贯彻“加强领导，积极稳步前进，分批铺开”的方针；防止自满情绪；发挥集体领导作用；加强工作中的组织性和纪律性。省委决定组织力量，分头深入下层检查巡视和及时指导这一工作。同时，省委找出在全面深入宣传总路线和购粮政策当中，要抓住几个环节：首先是大张旗鼓地做好总路线的宣传，贯彻党的政策，防止急躁情绪和强迫命令作风；加强贫农与中农的巩固团结；购粮工作要密切和生产结合，同时要搞好互助合作；把经济工作和政治工作密切结合，扭转某些经济工作干部在物资供应上“重城市、轻农村，重生活资料、轻生产资料”的片面思想。省委强调应加强党在宣传工作中的活动；要求农村党员要做好总路线的学习和宣传；要带头将余粮卖给国家，并且要说服别人；要带头将卖粮的钱用在扩大生产上；党员不准投机倒把。省委这一布置，将使全省全面地深入地宣传总路线和购粮政策工作继续深入展开。  （刘群）
