    The study of the general line by cadres of the Central Geological Department has gradually deepened. After Deputy Minister Liu Jie made a report to all cadres on the general line and general tasks of the national transition period, the General Study Committee convened the directors of the various sub-study committees to discuss the leadership of the study. It was decided to divide the study into two stages: In the first stage, widespread publicity would be conducted to ensure that all personnel understand the basic content of the general line; in the second stage, all cadres would be required to examine their work in the spirit of the general line in order to improve their thinking and work.

    Judging from the study situation over the past twenty days, some comrades still do not fully understand the general line and lack a clear understanding of the nature of Chinese society today; some staff members have encountered many difficulties in their studies. In view of this situation, the General Study Committee plans to organize several special reports, with leading cadres answering the difficult questions raised by some comrades; organize discussions, and assign cadres to report on their learning experiences to enlighten everyone.

    In order to enable the cadres to study the general line well, the Party General Branch of the Central Geological Department decided to invite Deputy Minister Liu Jie to make another report to all comrades on December 7, combining it with answers to questions. The Secretary of the Youth League General Branch also called on all members to study earnestly through the League members' congress.

    At present, the General Study Committee of the Central Geological Department is planning to organize discussions based on the questions raised by the comrades, in order to lay the foundation for the second stage of study (combining documents to examine work).

    Also reported: Cadres of the Central Ministry of Commerce began to study the general line and general tasks of the national transition period in mid-November.

    Before the start of the study, the Party Committee of the Ministry of Commerce, in accordance with the instructions of the higher Party Committee, arranged the study, requiring cadres participating in theoretical study, especially leading cadres, to clearly understand the general line and general tasks of the national transition period, to draw a clear line between socialist and capitalist ideology, so as to have a basis for carrying out tasks, deploying and inspecting work. It also required responsible cadres of various departments to conscientiously lead this study. After the official start of the study, Yao Yilin, Deputy Minister of Commerce, made a mobilization report to all cadres on studying the general line, which improved the comrades' enthusiasm for learning.

    The Party and administrative responsible comrades of the vast majority of units conscientiously led the study. However, the Party branches of a few units did not conscientiously study and discuss the study plan, but simply passed on the plan of the Ministry as it was; some administrative responsible cadres have not yet participated in the leadership; some Party member cadres above the section chief level have not even seriously read the documents.

    In view of the above situation, the Party Committee of the Central Ministry of Commerce recently held the third joint meeting of branch secretaries to discuss the issue of further strengthening the leadership of the study, and decided to focus on the leadership of the study for Party member cadres above the section chief level; unify the steps of the Party, the Youth League, and the Trade Union in the organization, and take the leadership of the study of the general line as the central task of this period; and establish necessary inspection and reporting systems.

    中央地质部、商业部党组织
    认真领导学习国家过渡时期总路线
    中央地质部干部的总路线学习，已逐步深入。在刘杰副部长向全体干部作了关于国家过渡时期总路线、总任务的传达报告之后，总学习委员会即召集各分学习委员会主任，讨论了学习的领导问题，决定把这次学习分两步进行：在第一阶段中，广泛地进行宣传，使全体人员都了解总路线的基本内容；第二阶段中，要求全体干部根据总路线的精神检查工作，以达到提高思想、改进工作的目的。
    根据二十多天来的学习情况看来，有些同志对总路线仍不够了解，对中国现在社会性质缺乏明确的认识；部分工作人员在学习中发生了许多困难。总学习委员会根据这种情况，准备组织几次专题报告，由领导干部解答某些同志所提出的疑难问题；组织座谈，指定干部报告学习心得，以启发大家。
    中央地质部党总支为了使干部们学好总路线，决定在十二月七日请刘杰副部长结合问题解答，向全体同志再作一次报告。青年团总支书记也通过团员大会号召全体团员认真学习。
    现在，中央地质部总学习委员会正计划根据同志们所提出的问题，组织大家进行讨论，为第二阶段的学习（结合文件检查工作）打下基础。

    又讯：中央商业部干部，从十一月中旬开始学习国家过渡时期总路线和总任务。
    学习开始前，商业部党委根据上级党委的指示，布置了学习，要求参加理论学习的干部，特别是领导干部，明确认识国家过渡时期的总路线和总任务，划清社会主义与资本主义的思想界限，从而在执行任务、布置和检查工作时有所依据。并要求各部门负责干部认真领导这次学习。学习正式开始后，商业部姚依林副部长曾向全体干部作了关于学习总路线的动员报告，提高了同志们的学习情绪。
    绝大部分单位的党、行政负责同志认真地领导了学习。但有少数单位的党支部没有认真地研究和讨论学习计划，只把部的计划原样向下传；有些行政负责干部还没有参加领导；有些科长级以上的党员干部甚至还没有认真阅读文件。
    中央商业部党委针对上述情况，曾在最近召开了第三次支部书记联席会，讨论了进一步加强对学习的领导问题，决定把重点放在对科长以上的党员干部学习的领导上；在组织上统一党、青年团、工会的步调，把领导学习总路线作为这一时期的中心任务；并建立必要的检查、汇报制度。
