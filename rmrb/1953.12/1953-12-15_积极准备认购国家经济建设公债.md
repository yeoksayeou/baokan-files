Actively Prepare to Subscribe to National Economic Construction Bonds

Editor's Note: Since the announcement of the issuance of national economic construction bonds, our newspaper has received many letters from readers every day, expressing their enthusiastic support and determination to actively subscribe to the bonds. Excerpts are published below:

(I)

    A letter from Han Enlai, a national model agricultural worker: All members of our agricultural production cooperative were very happy to hear the news that the government will issue national economic construction bonds in January 1954. Everyone understands that this is a necessary measure for socialist industrialization. When the national industry is developed, it will be able to manufacture a large number of tractors and automobiles, and build power stations and water conservancy projects. In this way, our agricultural production can use machines or new farm tools to produce sooner, and our farmers can live a good life like Soviet farmers sooner.

    Since we organized ourselves for production, the amount of production has increased year by year, and everyone's life has been improving day by day. Just say this year, our cooperative has built twenty-seven new brick houses and ten thatched houses, every family has bright glass windows, the walls are painted snow-white, and some families even have floors. As soon as the weather turned cold, all the men, women, old and young in the cooperative put on new cotton clothes, inside and out... Ah, there are so many good things to say, but where did they come from? The cooperative members all said: "A good life cannot be separated from the Communist Party and Chairman Mao." "If it weren't for the help of industrial construction, our lives wouldn't be so good so quickly."

    All our members have made up their minds to sell all the surplus grain to the state, and at the same time, to do a good job in this winter's sideline production. In addition to using these two incomes for expanding production next year, we will also buy more bonds. This is also a practical action for us to support national socialist industrialization.

    Letters from Fu Guozhu, Huang Fangzhen, Liu Shuming, Gu Fangyi, Luo Ming, and others from the Chinese Overseas Students Supplementary School:

    When the news of the issuance of national economic construction bonds came from the radio broadcast, we listened breathlessly and were indescribably excited.

    The issuance of national economic construction bonds means that more and more new factory buildings will stand on the motherland's land, and more and more tractors will appear in the motherland's fields. Ah! What language can express our love for the ever-changing and rapidly developing motherland! We immediately thought of Mayakovsky's lines:

    I praise
    The motherland's present
    I praise three times
    The motherland's future

    However, we have contributed too little to the motherland. Issuing bonds is great, this is the time for us to contribute our strength. We decided to save as much money as possible to subscribe to the bonds. We all agree that buying one more bond means putting one more point of strength into national economic construction.

(III)

    Letters from Kou Baoguang, Feng Guosheng, Dong Qingwu, Wang Huiru, Wang Shanzeng, Li Fengshan, and others from the 18th Engineering Team of the North China Civil Engineering Construction Company of the China Electrical Industry Union:

    The significance of issuing national economic construction bonds has been said a lot in the newspapers, we completely agree, and this is exactly what we want to say. What we need to do now is: (1) Do our best to subscribe to national economic construction bonds with our maximum economic strength; (2) Publicize to the comrades around us and mobilize them to subscribe to more bonds; (3) Work and study more actively. This is what we decided to do after discussion, and we will definitely guarantee to do it.

(IV)

    A letter from Shang Shuzhen from the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Administrative Cadre School in Hebei Province: I was so excited when I saw the news of the issuance of bonds in the newspaper, I shouted: "I've been waiting for this!" In order to build the motherland, issuing bonds is absolutely necessary. In February this year, Comrade Bo Yibo said in his report on the 1953 national budget that bonds would be issued at an appropriate time. From then on, I started saving money to prepare for the purchase. But I waited and waited, and there was no news. I persuaded myself, it's not the right time yet, the government is planning. Now, it's finally here!

    In the past six months, I have saved 990,000 yuan, of course, I will use it all to buy bonds, and I plan to save money every month to buy more in the future. My number is very small, but the national total is not small, so I will also go to the people to publicize and mobilize everyone to actively purchase bonds.

(V)

    Letters from Ma Ling, Zhang Jiaqi, Che Youchun, Fang Zonglin, Liu Bisu, Zhou Wanfang, and others from the Air Force Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army: After hearing the news of the issuance of bonds, we held a symposium. The result of the symposium was "unanimous enthusiastic support, ready to actively subscribe."

    The Soviet people have used their experience in building their own country to prove that issuing bonds is one of the important methods for socialist industrialization to accumulate funds. Now, our national economic construction bonds will also promote China's socialist industrialization.

    We are not only proud to work hard and defend the national defense, but also to enthusiastically subscribe to bonds and contribute to economic construction. We are determined to save our allowances as much as possible and buy more bonds.

### 积极准备认购国家经济建设公债

    积极准备认购国家经济建设公债
    编者按：发行国家经济建设公债的消息公布后，本报每天都收到许多读者来信，表示热烈拥护，决心要踊跃认购公债。现择要发表如下：
    （一）
    全国农业劳动模范韩恩来信：我们农业生产合作社全体社员听到政府将在一九五四年一月发行国家经济建设公债的消息后，都非常高兴。大伙都明白，这是社会主义工业化的必要措施。国家工业发达了，就能制造大批拖拉机、汽车，建设发电站、水利工程。这样，我们的农业生产就能早一天用机器或新农具来生产，我们农民就能早一天像苏联农民一样地过好生活。
    我们自从组织起来生产后，生产量一年比一年增加，大伙的生活也跟着一天天向上。就说今年，我们社里又盖了二十七间新砖房和十间草房，家家都是通亮的玻璃窗，墙壁刷得雪白，有的家里还铺着地板，天刚冷，全社男女老小都穿上了面、里三新的棉衣，……。啊呀，好生活多得说不完，可这是哪来的呢？社员们都说：“好日子离不开共产党、毛主席。”“若不是工业建设的帮助，咱们生活也不会好得这么快。”
    我们全体社员下了决心，一面把全部余粮卖给国家，一面要搞好今冬副业生产，这两笔收入，除用到来年的扩大生产上去外，还要多买公债。这也就是我们支持国家社会主义工业化的一个实际行动。
    （二）
    归国华侨学生补习学校符国柱、黄妨珍、刘淑明、古方毅、罗明等来信：
    无线电广播中传来发行国家经济建设公债的消息，我们屏息静气地听完，兴奋得不可名状。
    发行国家经济建设公债，这就是说，祖国的土地上将更多地耸立起一幢幢新的厂房，祖国的田野里将出现一辆辆拖拉机。啊！用什么语言才能表达出我们对日新月异、飞跃发展着的祖国的热爱啊！我们立时想起了马雅可夫斯基的诗句来：
    我赞美
    祖国的现在
    我三倍赞美
    祖国的将来
    可是，我们为祖国所出的力量太少了。发行公债，那太好了，这正是我们贡献力量的时机。我们决定尽量节约出钱来认购公债。我们一致认为，多认购一份公债，就是为国家经济建设多放进一分力量。
    （三）
    中国电业工会华北土木建筑工程公司第十八工程队寇宝光、冯国盛、董庆武、王蕙茹、王善增、李凤山等来信：
    发行国家经济建设公债的意义，报上已经说了很多，我们完全同意，同时这也正是我们要说的话。现在我们要做的事是：（一）尽自己的最大经济力量来认购国家经济建设公债；（二）向周围同志们宣传，动员他们多多认购公债；（三）更加积极工作和学习。这是我们讨论以后决定要做的事，我们一定保证做到。
    （四）
    河北省石家庄专区行政干部学校尚淑贞来信：从报上看到发行公债的消息，我兴奋得大叫起来：“可盼到了！”为了建设祖国，发行公债是完全必要的。今年二月里薄一波同志关于一九五三年国家预算的报告中曾说过要在适当时机发行公债，从那时起，我就开始存钱准备购买。但是盼呀盼的，老不见音讯。我就自己劝自己，还不到适当时机哩，政府正在计划哩。如今，可真盼到了！
    半年多来，我已存下九十九万元，当然全部拿来买公债，而且准备以后还要按月存钱多买。我这数字很小，但全国加起来就不小了，所以我还要去向人们宣传，动员大家都来积极购买公债。
    （五）
    中国人民解放军空军司令部马玲、张家琪、车幼椿、方宗林、刘璧荪、周万芳等来信：听到发行公债的消息后，我们开了一个座谈会。座谈结果是“一致热烈拥护，准备积极认购”。
    苏联人民已经用他们建设自己祖国的经验证明，发行公债是社会主义工业化积累资金的重要方法之一。现在，我们的国家经济建设公债也将促进我国的社会主义工业化。
    我们不但以努力工作、保卫国防为光荣，并且将以踊跃认购公债、为经济建设出力引为光荣。我们决心尽量省下自己的津贴费，多买公债。
