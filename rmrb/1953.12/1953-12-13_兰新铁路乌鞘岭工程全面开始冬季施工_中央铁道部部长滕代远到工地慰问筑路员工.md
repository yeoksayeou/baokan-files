    Xinhua News Agency Report: Winter construction has fully commenced on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway's Wushaoling project. Over 20,000 construction workers are engaged in a tenacious battle against the severe cold and ice on this mountain range, which rises to an altitude of 3,000 meters. Currently, the lowest temperature at Wushaoling has dropped to over minus 20 degrees Celsius. The frozen soil layer on the ground is up to 70 centimeters thick in some places, and in the most hardened areas, even the 2.5-ton blade of a bulldozer can hardly penetrate it. To prevent the severe cold from affecting the progress and ensuring the quality of the project, the roadbeds under construction are being loosened continuously, day and night, using the power of machines to vibrate the soil. Straw is also being laid on the roadbeds. Bridges and culverts are being covered with warm sheds. The warm sheds at the east and west tunnel entrances extend for as long as half a kilometer, and stoves are lit inside. Giant generators, steam winches, ventilators, and other equipment have also been fitted with insulation.

    Wushaoling is a key project of massive scale on the entire Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway line. The 20-kilometer section from the Wushaoling No. 1 Tunnel to the western foot of the Wushaoling mountain requires the excavation and filling of 2.5 million cubic meters of earth. In addition, it is necessary to erect an 18-meter-high bridge between the two mountains and excavate a two-kilometer-long tunnel. To conquer these arduous tasks in winter and accelerate the progress of the project, more than 200 machines have been concentrated at various construction sites, and more than ten kilometers of lighting have been installed, illuminating the construction site as if it were daytime at night. Currently, the road construction workers are overcoming various difficulties with selfless labor enthusiasm.

    [Xinhua News Agency] Minister of Railways of the Central People's Government, Teng Daiyuan, and Vice Minister Wang Shitai, accompanied by Soviet experts, inspected the Wushaoling and Heihe River Beach areas of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway in November. They also visited the tunnel teams, earthwork teams, bridge teams, the 23rd Detachment, and the Sixth Survey Brigade to console the road construction workers engaged in large-scale winter construction and the survey workers who were determining the Lanzhou-Su segment of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway. On November 25th, Teng Daiyuan convened a forum at the Wushaoling construction site with many advanced workers who had overcome various difficulties of nature. He also broadcast a message of consolation to the more than 20,000 road construction workers at the Wushaoling construction site. The broadcast praised the numerous creations of many workers and engineering technicians and instructed all employees to pay more attention to cold protection during winter construction, further improve safety work, ensure quality, and strive to fulfill the tasks of increasing production and practicing economy.

    兰新铁路乌鞘岭工程全面开始冬季施工
    中央铁道部部长滕代远到工地慰问筑路员工
    据新华社讯：兰新铁路乌鞘岭工程的冬季施工已经全面开始，两万多个筑路职工正在这个拔海三千公尺高的山岭上和严寒冰雪展开顽强的斗争。现在乌鞘岭最低气温已下降到摄氏零下二十多度，地面的冻土层有的达七公寸厚，冻结得最坚硬的地方，连推土机二吨半重的刀片也难插下去。为了防止严寒影响工程的进展，保证工程的质量，正在施工的路基都在日夜三班地利用机器震动的威力，连续进行松土工作。路基上并铺上了麦草；桥梁、涵管也架搭起暖棚，东西隧道口搭的暖棚长达一里，里面都生着火炉；巨大的发电机、蒸汽卷扬机、通风机等也都装上了保暖设备。
    乌鞘岭是兰新铁路全线规模巨大的重点工程。从乌鞘岭一号隧道到乌鞘岭西边山脚二十公里的一段，需要填挖二百五十万方泥土。此外，还需要在两山之间架起十八公尺高的大桥，开凿两里长的隧道。为了在冬季就来开始征服这些艰巨的工程，加速工程的进展，各个施工工地上，已经集中了两百多台机器，装置了十多公里长的照明灯，入夜，照得工地如同白昼一样。现在，筑路工人们正以忘我的劳动热情，克服着各种困难。
    【新华社讯】中央人民政府铁道部部长滕代远、副部长王世泰偕同苏联专家等，先后在十一月间到兰新铁路乌鞘岭和黑河河滩等地视察，并赴隧道队、土石方工程队、桥梁队、二十三联队、第六勘测总队，慰问正在进行大规模冬季施工的筑路工人和正在定测兰新铁路兰肃段的勘测工人。滕代远十一月二十五日曾在乌鞘岭工地召集战胜大自然各种困难的许多先进工作者座谈，并对乌鞘岭工地两万多筑路职工进行广播慰问。广播中表扬了许多工人和工程技术人员的大量创造，并指示全体职工要更加注意冬季施工中的防寒工作，进一步做好安全工作、保证质量，努力完成增产节约任务。
