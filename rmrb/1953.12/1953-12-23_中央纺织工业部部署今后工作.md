The Central Textile Industry Department issued instructions on "The Current Situation of the Textile Industry and Future Work Deployment," excerpts of which are published below:

    Basic Situation of the Textile Industry at Present

    Over the past four years, the textile industry sector has basically implemented the central government's instructions on restoring and developing production, completed the restoration and initial transformation of enterprises, and made some progress in production, playing a certain role in supplying people's needs, stabilizing the market, and accumulating funds.

    In 1952, the output of major products of the national textile industry increased significantly: cotton yarn increased by 101% compared to 1949, and by 51% compared to the highest historical annual output; cotton cloth increased by 130% compared to 1949, and by 67% compared to the highest historical annual output; jute bags increased by 571% compared to 1949, and by 87% compared to the highest historical annual output; domestic silk increased by 390% compared to 1949. In addition, the output of woolen textiles, printing and dyeing, knitwear reproduction, and silk spinning has also increased year by year.

    In the past two years, the state has also paid attention to developing the textile industry in the interior, and the phenomenon of uneven distribution of equipment has begun to change. Due to the development of state-owned textile industry production and the increase in equipment, the proportion of state-owned and private sectors in the textile industry has also changed significantly. However, in terms of absolute output, the production of private factories has also increased year by year. For example, in 1949, they only produced 842,000 bales of cotton yarn, while in 1952, they produced 1,266,000 bales, an increase of 50.3%.

    Another significant feature of the restoration and transformation of China's textile industry is that, along with the growth of state-owned forces, the proportion of state capitalist components has increased significantly. Since 1950, the state has adopted measures to uniformly distribute raw materials (mainly cotton) and uniformly purchase products or processing. This has not only achieved victory in stabilizing the market and fighting imperialism, but also rapidly developed state capitalism, thereby strengthening the leading position of the state-owned textile industry.

    The equipment utilization rate of China's textile industry, especially the cotton textile industry, which accounts for 70% of the total textile industry output value, has reached a relatively high level. This is due to the objective situation of China's limited equipment and large population. At present, except for some factories in individual regions where the equipment utilization rate has not been fully utilized, all state-owned factories across the country have implemented a three-shift production system, and the equipment utilization rate will reach 95.4% in 1953.

    With the restoration and development of production, the ranks of the working class in the textile industry have expanded. In the past four years, there have also been great improvements in factory working conditions and workers' lives. Most state-owned factories have newly built workshop cooling equipment, increased safety devices and dust removal equipment, adjusted wages and working hours, and built welfare facilities such as workers' dormitories, hospitals, and nurseries. These measures have greatly stimulated the workers' enthusiasm for labor and promoted the continuous development of production.

    The original machine repair factories in textile enterprises, after adjustment and improvement and organization of specialized division of labor, have been able to manufacture complete sets of textile machinery. The product quality has gradually improved year by year, and they are currently designing and trial-manufacturing higher-performance machines. In terms of mechanical design and manufacturing, a group of technical personnel has also been trained. The textile machinery and equipment required year by year in the future can gradually be self-sufficient.

    Although the state-owned textile industry has achieved the above achievements in recent years, there are still some important problems that need to be solved: the equipment of China's textile industry is extremely insufficient, and this situation will become more serious with the increasing needs of the people; the phenomenon of uneven equipment distribution has not yet been overcome, not only in terms of regional distribution, but also in terms of the imbalance between spinning, weaving, and printing and dyeing; in terms of enterprise management, there are still many serious shortcomings, especially the quality, variety, and color, which cannot well meet the needs of the people; and the leadership of private enterprises is still insufficient.

    Tasks of the State-Owned Textile Industry in the Future

    According to the general line of the state during the transition period and the current situation of China's textile industry, the general task of the state-owned textile industry in the future is: on the basis of improving enterprise management, raising technical level, and rationally adjusting equipment, to fully exert the potential of existing enterprises, increase output, and improve quality. According to needs and possibilities, new factories should be built in a planned manner in the cotton-producing areas of China's hinterland to meet the people's growing needs and accumulate funds for national industrialization; while ensuring the continuous growth of the proportion of the socialist economy, correctly lead the development of private textile industry towards state capitalism, and gradually carry out socialist transformation, giving play to its positive aspects.

    First, the supply of cloth is related to the life of every person in the country, and to the connection between the Party and the state and the masses of the people. Therefore, the most fundamental problem facing the textile industry at present is how to meet the growing needs of the urban and rural people. To this end, the textile industry must quickly increase a considerable number of spindles and looms in the next few years while giving full play to the potential of existing equipment. If preparations are not made as soon as possible in this regard, there may be a danger of disconnecting from the needs of the people in the future.

    In the future basic construction plan of the textile industry, the problem of uneven regional distribution must be gradually solved, so that factories are close to raw material producing areas and inland markets. Therefore, some new cotton textile factories and printing and dyeing factories must be built to gradually develop new textile industrial bases.

    In the process of building new enterprises, in addition to solving the imbalance between regions, the imbalance between spinning, weaving, and printing and dyeing equipment should also be solved. As for wool, silk, knitwear, rayon, etc., equipment should be appropriately increased according to needs and possibilities, and a foundation should be laid for future development.

    Within five years, although the new factories built by the state can be put into production one after another, the supply of yarn and cloth still basically depends on existing factories. In addition, although China's textile industry has a relatively long history and a relatively solid foundation, the factory buildings are old, the machinery and equipment are unreasonable, and they have been in disrepair for a long time. Therefore, fully utilizing the existing equipment capacity and transforming existing enterprises, so that they cooperate with the new factories, is particularly important. On the one hand, planning management should be further strengthened for existing enterprises, and the economic accounting system should be implemented, especially strengthening technical management and improving the technical responsibility system. On the basis of continuously improving the technical level and improving enterprise management, the potential of enterprises should be brought into play; in some areas where textile equipment has not been fully utilized, efforts should be made to overcome difficulties, give full play to the equipment utilization rate, and organize production. On the other hand, according to the principle of less investment and quick results, the machinery and equipment of existing enterprises should be rationally adjusted and transformed in a focused and step-by-step manner, especially enterprises such as woolen textiles, silk spinning, and flax, should make full use of existing equipment and give play to production efficiency on the premise of improving quality and increasing varieties and colors.

    In developing the production of the state-owned textile industry, attention should be paid to giving play to the initiative of local areas. In the cotton and other textile raw material producing areas, local areas should plan to cooperate with the enterprises under the Ministry of Textile Industry, appropriately build or expand a number of textile factories and printing and dyeing factories; for the existing local state-owned enterprises, the equipment should be adjusted, the business management should be improved, and the product quality should be improved.

    Second, the textile industry should not only meet the needs of the people in quantity, but also meet the needs of the people in terms of quality, variety, and color. In the past, the main task of the textile industry was to ensure the minimum needs of the people in quantity. Therefore, the product quality was not high, the varieties were not many, and the colors were monotonous. This was inevitable and permissible during the period of national economic recovery, when the people's purchasing power was still low and textile products were extremely insufficient. However, with the recovery and development of China's national economy, the people's purchasing power has increased significantly in recent years. The broad masses of the people not only demand to be satisfied in quantity, but also begin to demand to be satisfied in terms of quality, variety, and color. In the future, with the increasing development of industrial and agricultural production, this demand will become increasingly urgent and improved. If this point is not seen, the textile industry will not be able to fully meet the needs of the people. In the production of state-owned enterprises, the most important issues at present are quality and variety. Many enterprises often fail to complete the quality plan, such as uneven cotton yarn sliver, insufficient tensile strength, high rate of substandard cloth, low printing and dyeing technology, and few varieties. These shortcomings are particularly manifested in the processing cloth of local state-owned textile industry and private small factories.

    The main reasons for the above phenomena are that some leading departments and responsible cadres rarely investigate and study the needs of the people, only bury themselves in production, and do not ask about market needs, or push the responsibility of studying the needs of the people to the commercial departments. In fact, this is due to the conservative thinking of lacking a sense of fresh things, as reflected in the play "Dawn Shines on Moscow."

    In order to improve the quality of state-owned textile products and increase varieties and colors, factories should strictly supervise the implementation of various technical operation methods, deeply consolidate the "Hao Jianxiu Work Method" and the "1951 Weaving Work Method," promote the "1953 Textile Machine Maintenance Work Method" and the maintenance work system, vigorously reduce the breakage rate, strengthen the product inspection system, and mobilize the workers to strive to improve product quality. Secondly, vigorously improve product varieties and strengthen the leadership of pattern design. We should start from studying the needs of the people, actively trial-produce and produce various new products, and design patterns that are loved by the masses. To this end, we should overcome the conservative thinking among personnel at all levels who cannot see the new needs of the masses. Thirdly, gradually improve the quality of raw materials; practical specifications and standards should be formulated, and gradually improved with the assistance of relevant departments; at the same time, some equipment necessary for improving quality should also be appropriately resolved.

    While improving the quality of textile products and increasing varieties and colors, attention should be paid to reducing product costs. The view that puts improving product quality and reducing costs in opposition should be criticized.

    In the enterprises of the textile industry, safe production and labor protection are of great significance. We should continue to increase workshop cooling equipment and dust removal equipment, install more safety devices, and pay attention to the special needs of female workers (female workers account for more than 70% in cotton textile enterprises, and female workers account for an average of 50% of the entire state-owned textile industry).

    Third, further strengthen the leadership of the private textile industry. The private part of China's textile industry has a relatively long history and a relatively large proportion. In the past few years, the state's leadership over the private textile industry has been relatively strong, and the state capitalist components in the textile industry have also increased significantly. The state-owned textile industry has established a leading position in the textile industry, and the main textile products have been basically controlled by the state. For private enterprises, productivity has also been improved and a certain profit can be obtained. In the future, under the requirements of developing production and ensuring needs, continuing to strengthen the leadership of the state-owned textile industry over the private textile industry is still an important task of the textile industry sector. To this end, the scope of processing and ordering goods should be appropriately expanded in a planned manner, guiding and helping them to improve technology, improve quality, improve business management, appropriately give play to their production enthusiasm, and, according to needs and possible conditions, expand the scope of joint state-private ownership in a planned and gradual manner, and strengthen the transformation of private enterprises.

    In strengthening the leadership of the private textile industry, we must pay attention to the vast manual weaving industry and some knitting, reproduction, and other industries with backward production methods. According to incomplete statistics, there are about 180,000 manual looms (i.e., iron and wood looms) across the country, which can weave more than 20 million pieces of cloth every year, which is a great force. In the knitting and reproduction industry, the annual yarn demand accounts for about 20% of the total output, which is also a considerable force. However, these industries and product types are extremely complex, the situations vary, the production is scattered, and the production methods are backward. We must adopt a cautious policy towards them, that is, on the one hand, actively use their production capacity to serve the needs of the people, and on the other hand, we must steadily realize the transformation of them. For small and medium-sized enterprises such as knitting and reproduction, we should appropriately support their development; for small handicraftsmen, we should guide them to gradually move towards the road of cooperation and improve production; but there are some industries (such as manual looms, etc.), due to the development of state-owned enterprise production, in areas close to modern textile industrial cities, some will inevitably be eliminated or reduce the scope of production in the future, and we should appropriately organize them to change careers and solve the employment of unemployed workers, etc.

    Improve and Strengthen Leadership

    In recent years, under the leadership of the central government, the textile industry sector has made achievements in its work, but from the perspective of leadership, there are also many shortcomings and errors, which are manifested in: lacking active investigation and research on the various and changing demands of the masses of the people, relying solely on the sales department, so that we have always been countless about what the people need. There is also a certain degree of complacency and conservative thinking among leaders at all levels. There are many shortcomings in enterprise leadership, especially the enterprise technical management is weak, and the promotion and leadership of various advanced experiences are not strong enough. The atmosphere of leaders at all levels studying business is not strong, the political and ideological leadership is poor, the understanding of the situation below is not specific and not profound, and the research on the central government's policies and guidelines is not enough. Therefore, in the leadership work, it is inevitable to show the problem of generalization. In order to complete the arduous tasks in the future, the textile industry sector must earnestly improve and strengthen the leadership work at all levels, timely study the central government's policies and guidelines, conduct in-depth and systematic investigations and research, find the central link of each period, put forward clear and specific work tasks, and should grasp the key points, summarize experience, promote the overall situation, and strive to do a better job in the future.

    中央纺织工业部部署今后工作
    中央人民政府纺织工业部发布了“关于目前纺织工业情况及今后工作部署”的指示，兹摘要发表如下：
    纺织工业目前的基本情况
    四年来，纺织工业部门基本上执行了中央关于恢复和发展生产的指示，完成了企业的恢复和初步改造工作，并使生产有了一些发展，在供应人民需要、稳定市场及积累资金方面，都起了一定的作用。
    一九五二年，全国纺织工业主要产品的产量均有很大增长：棉纱比一九四九年增加百分之一百零一，比历史最高年产量增加百分之五十一；棉布比一九四九年增加百分之一百三十，比历史最高年产量增加百分之六十七；麻袋比一九四九年增加百分之五百七十一，比历史最高年产量增加百分之八十七；家蚕丝比一九四九年增加百分之三百九十。此外，毛纺、印染、针织复制、绢纺等产量，也逐年均有增长。
    近两年来，国家又注意了在内地发展纺织工业，设备分布不平衡的现象开始起了变化。由于国营纺织工业生产的发展与设备的增加，纺织工业中国营与私营的比重也起了较大的变化。但如果以绝对产量说，私营厂的生产也是逐年增长的，如一九四九年只产棉纱八十四万二千件，一九五二年为一百二十六万六千件，增加了百分之五十点三。
    我国纺织工业在恢复和改造过程中另一个显著的特点：在国营力量增长的同时，国家资本主义成分的比重有了较大的增长。一九五○年起，国家采取了统一分配原料（主要是棉花）和统购产品或加工的措施，这样不仅在稳定市场、和帝国主义斗争方面取得了胜利，而且使国家资本主义迅速得到发展，从而增强了国营纺织工业的领导地位。
    我国纺织工业特别是占全部纺织工业产值百分之七十的棉纺织业的设备利用率已达到较高的水平，这是我国设备少、人口多的客观情况所促成的。目前除个别地区的部分工厂设备利用率尚未充分发挥外，全国国营工厂均已实行三班生产制，一九五三年设备利用率将达百分之九十五点四。
    随着生产的恢复和发展，纺织工业方面工人阶级的队伍扩大了。在工厂劳动条件和工人生活方面，近四年来亦有了很大改善，多数国营工厂已新建车间降温设备，增加了安全装置与除尘设备，调整了工资、工时，增建了工房、医院、托儿所等福利设施。这些措施，大大激发了工人的劳动积极性，推动了生产不断向前发展。
    纺织企业中原有的机器修配厂，经过调整改进与组织专业分工，已能自制全套纺织机器，产品质量逐年有所提高，目前正在设计与试制较高性能的机器；在机械设计与制造方面，并培养了一批技术人员。今后逐年所需的纺织机器设备逐步可以自给。
    国营纺织业这几年来虽获得了以上一些成就，但目前仍存在着若干重要问题需要解决：我国纺织工业的设备极感不足，随着人民需要的日益增长，这种状况将更加严重；设备不平衡的现象仍未克服，不仅地区分布不平衡，而且纺、织、印染之间亦存在着不平衡；在企业管理方面，仍存在着不少严重的缺点，特别是质量、品种、花色，不能很好满足人民的需要；对于私营企业的领导也还不够。
    今后国营纺织工业的任务
    根据国家在过渡时期的总路线和我国纺织工业目前的情况，国营纺织工业今后总的任务是：在改善企业管理、提高技术水平、和合理调整设备的基础上，充分发挥现有企业的潜在能力，增加产量、提高质量。根据需要与可能，在我国腹部的产棉地区，有计划地建设新厂，以满足人民日益增长的需要，并为国家工业化积累资金；在保证社会主义经济比重不断增长的前提下，正确领导私营纺织业向国家资本主义发展，并逐步进行社会主义改造，发挥其积极方面的作用。
    第一、布匹的供应关系着全国每一个人的生活，关系着党和国家与人民群众的联系，因而纺织工业目前最根本的问题，就是如何满足城乡人民日益增长的需要。为此，纺织工业在发挥现有设备潜力的条件下，尚须在几年内迅速增加相当数量的纱锭和织布机，这方面如不及早准备，将来就可能发生与人民需要脱节的危险。
    在纺织工业今后的基本建设计划中，必须逐步解决地区分布不平衡的问题，使工厂接近原料产地和内地市场。因此，必须新建一些棉纺织工厂和印染厂，逐步发展新的纺织工业基地。
    在建设新的企业的过程中，除解决地区间的不平衡以外，同时应解决纺、织、印染设备之间不平衡问题。至于毛、丝、针织、人造纤维等方面，应按需要与可能，适当地增加设备，并为将来的发展打下基础。
    在五年以内，国家新建的工厂虽可陆续投入生产，但纱布的供应基本上仍须靠现有工厂来解决，加之我国的纺织工业虽历史较久，较有基础，但厂房陈旧，机器设备不合理，且长期失修，因此，充分利用现有设备能力、改造现有企业，使其与新建工厂相互配合，有特别重要的作用。一方面，对现有企业应进一步加强计划管理，贯彻经济核算制，特别是加强技术管理和健全技术责任制，在不断提高技术水平和改善企业管理的基础上，发挥企业的潜在力量；某些地区纺织设备尚未充分利用者，应设法克服困难，发挥设备利用率，组织生产。另一方面，根据投资少、收效快的原则，应有重点和有步骤地对现有企业的机器设备加以合理调整和改造，尤其是毛纺、绢纺、亚麻等企业，应尽量利用现有设备，在提高质量、增加品种花色的前提下发挥生产效能。
    发展国营纺织工业的生产，应注意发挥地方的积极性。在棉花和其他纺织原料的产区，地方应有计划地与纺织工业部所属企业相互分工配合，适当兴建或扩建若干纺织工厂和印染工厂；对于现有的地方国营企业，应进行设备的调整，切实改善经营管理工作，提高产品质量。
    第二、纺织工业不仅应在数量上满足人民需要，而且应在质量、品种、花色等方面满足人民的需要。过去，纺织工业主要任务是在数量上保证人民最低限度的需要，因此，产品质量不高，品种不多，花色单调。这在国民经济恢复时期，人民购买力尚低和纺织产品极感不足的情况下，是不得不然和可以允许的。但随着我国国民经济的恢复和发展，近年来人民购买力已有显著提高，广大人民群众不仅要求数量上能得到满足，并开始要求在质量、品种、花色等方面得到满足，在今后工农业生产日益发展的情况下，这种要求更会日益迫切和提高。如果看不到这一点，纺织工业就无法完满地满足人民的需要。在国营企业的生产中，当前最重要的问题，就是质量和品种问题，许多企业经常不能完成质量计划，如棉纱条杆不匀，拉力不足，次布率大，印染技术较低，品种又少，这些缺点特别表现在地方国营纺织业和私营小厂的加工布方面。
    产生上述现象的原因，主要的是某些领导部门和负责干部，对人民的需要很少调查研究，只埋头生产，不问市场需要，或者把研究人民需要的责任都推给商业部门，实际上这是对新鲜事物缺乏感觉的保守思想作怪的缘故，正如“曙光照耀着莫斯科”一剧所反映的那样。
    为了提高国营纺织产品质量，增加品种、花色，各厂今后应严格督促执行各种技术操作方法，深入巩固“郝建秀工作法”与“一九五一织布工作法”，推广“一九五三纺织机器保全工作法”和保全工作制度，大力降低断头率，加强产品检验制度，并发动职工群众努力提高产品质量。其次，大力改善产品品种，加强对花样设计的领导。应从研究人民需要着手，积极试制与生产各种新的产品，设计为群众所喜爱的花样，为此应克服各级人员中看不见群众新的需要的保守思想。再次，逐步地提高原料的质量；应规定切合实际的规格标准，在有关部门的协助下逐步提高；同时，提高质量所必需的某些设备，也应适当解决。
    在提高纺织产品的质量和增加品种花样的同时，应注意到降低产品成本的问题。把提高产品质量和降低成本对立的看法应加以批判。
    在纺织工业的企业中，安全生产和劳动保护有很重要的意义，应继续增加车间降温设备和除尘设备，多设安全装置，并注意女工的特殊要求（棉纺织企业中女工占百分之七十以上，整个国营纺织业女工平均占百分之五十）。
    第三、进一步加强对私营纺织业的领导。我国纺织工业中的私营部分，历史较久，比重也不小。几年来国家对私营纺织工业的领导是比较有力的，纺织工业中的国家资本主义成分也有了较大的增长，国营纺织业在纺织工业中已确立了领导地位，主要纺织产品基本上已为国家所掌握。对私营企业来说，生产力也有所提高，并能得到一定的利润。今后在发展生产、保证需要这一要求下，继续加强国营纺织业对私营纺织业的领导，仍是纺织工业部门的一项重要任务。为此，应有计划地适当扩大加工定货的范围，指导和帮助其提高技术，改善质量，改进经营管理，适当发挥其生产积极性，根据需要与可能条件，有计划地、逐步扩大公私合营的范围，加强对私营企业的改造工作。
    加强对私营纺织业的领导，必须注意到广大的手工织布业和某些生产方式落后的针织、复制等行业。据不很完全的统计，全国有手工织机（即铁木机）约十八万余台，每年约可织布二千万匹以上，这是一个很大的力量。在针织复制业方面，每年需纱量约占总产量百分之二十，也是很可观的一个力量。而这些行业与产品种类极为复杂，情况各异，生产分散，且生产方式落后。对它们必须采取慎重的政策，即一方面积极利用其生产能力为人民需要服务，另一方面又必须稳步地实现对他们的改造。对于针织、复制等中、小企业，应适当扶助其发展；对于小手工业者，应引导它们逐步走向合作化的道路，提高生产；但有一些行业（如手工织机等），由于国营企业生产发展，在接近近代纺织工业城市的地区，将来势必有一部分要被淘汰或缩小生产范围，对它们应适当组织转业并解决失业工人的就业等问题。
    改进和加强领导工作
    几年来，纺织工业部门在中央领导下，工作是有成绩的，但从领导上来检查，也存在不少缺点和错误，它表现在：对于人民群众各种不同的和日益变化着的要求，缺乏主动的进行调查研究，单纯依赖销售部门，以致对于人民到底需要什么这一问题一直心中无数。在各级领导中，也存在着一定程度的自满情绪与保守思想。企业领导工作中有不少缺点，特别是企业技术管理薄弱，对于各种先进经验的推广领导还不够有力。各级领导干部钻研业务的空气不浓，政治思想领导差，对下边的情况了解不具体不深刻，对中央的政策方针研究不够，因此在领导工作中就不可免地表现了一般化的毛病。为了完成今后的艰巨任务，纺织工业部门必须切实改进与加强各级领导工作，及时研究中央的方针政策，进行深入系统的调查研究，找出每个时期的中心环节，提出明确具体的工作任务，并应抓住重点，总结经验，推动全盘，争取今后把工作做得更好。
