Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 12th: The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC) has notified the Korean-Chinese side that the trial of the Kuomintang special agent’s murder of Zhang Zilong, a captured Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldier, will not begin today. On the 8th, the NNRC had notified that the trial, originally scheduled to begin on the 11th, would be postponed to the 12th.

General Li Xiangchao, Chief Commissioner of the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, wrote again to the NNRC on the 11th, opposing the provision of "defense lawyers" for the special agent murderers by the U.S. side, and pointed out: "Qualified defense lawyers can only be provided by India."

General Li Xiangchao pointed out that, according to the "Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," after prisoners of war are transferred to the custody of the NNRC, the detaining side should completely relinquish its control and influence over the prisoners of war, and therefore the U.S. side has no right to send so-called "defense lawyers."

General Li Xiangchao further pointed out that the facts have long proven that the U.S. side is the instigator of these murderers, and it cannot be allowed under any circumstances for the instigator of the murderers to send so-called "defense lawyers" for the murderers.

According to sources from the Indian Custodial Forces, the U.S. side has decided to arbitrarily assign an American, Morrison, and a "Chinese assistant" to appear in court to "defend" the seven special agent murderers who killed Zhang Zilong. The U.S. side concealed Morrison's true identity, falsely claiming that he was a "civilian," but in fact, he is a judge advocate of the U.S. Eighth Army invading Korea. The unnamed "Chinese assistant" is obviously a Kuomintang special agent from Taiwan. The U.S. side is attempting to directly help the murderers cover up the U.S.'s crimes of preventing repatriation by force in court through this approach, turning the trial into a farce.

### 中立国遣返委员会通知我方  延期审判特务杀害张子龙案

    中立国遣返委员会通知我方
    延期审判特务杀害张子龙案
    【新华社开城十二日电】中立国遣返委员会通知朝中方面，今日不开始对国民党特务杀害中国人民志愿军被俘人员张子龙案的审判。在八日，中立国遣返委员会曾通知，原定在十一日开始的审判改在十二日举行。
    军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员李相朝将军在十一日再次写信给中立国遣返委员会，反对由美方为特务凶手提供“辩护律师”，并指出：“合格的辩护律师只能由印度来提供。”
    李相朝将军指出，根据“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的规定，战俘移交中立国遣返委员会看管后，应该完全解除拘留一方对战俘的控制与影响，因而美方也就无权派所谓“辩护律师”。
    李相朝将军进一步指出，事实早已证明美方正是这些杀人凶犯的主使者，而凶犯的主使者为凶犯派出所谓“辩护律师”在任何情况下都不能被容许。
    据印度看管部队方面消息，美方决定擅自指派美国人摩里逊和一个“中国助理”出庭为杀害张子龙的七名特务凶手“辩护”。美方隐瞒摩里逊的真实身分，伪称他是“平民”，其实他是侵朝美军第八军的军法官。没有公布姓名的“中国助理”显然是台湾来的国民党特务。美方企图通过这种途径直接帮助凶手在法庭上掩盖美方以暴力阻止遣返的罪行，把审判变为滑稽剧。
