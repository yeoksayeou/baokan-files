To continuously improve the political and cultural level of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and grassroots cadres, and to strengthen the publication of popular reading materials, the national Popular Reading Publishing House has been established in Beijing.

The guiding principle of the Popular Reading Publishing House is: to target workers, peasants, soldiers, and grassroots cadres with literacy levels ranging from 2,000 characters to junior high school education as its primary readers, and to organize writing forces to edit and publish popular books and periodicals based on the needs of national construction work and the people's cultural life. This will include conducting common-sense education on Marxism-Leninism, publicizing national lines, policies, guidelines, and laws, popularizing cultural knowledge, and improving the ideological awareness, political level, and cultural level of the masses, so as to gradually realize the country's socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization. Its specific tasks are: editing and publishing popular books and periodicals on basic knowledge of social sciences, explaining current events and political policies and laws, and popular reading materials on language learning, history, geography, natural sciences, literature, and art.

After the national liberation, the demand for various popular reading materials among the broad working people has been increasing day by day. Although local state-owned publishing houses in various places have published some popular reading materials, partially satisfying the needs of readers, due to the strength of local publishing houses and their local limitations, they cannot completely solve the publication tasks in this area, especially the tasks of explaining policies and laws, explaining general basic theories, and introducing general basic knowledge. Although the Central People's Publishing House, China Youth Publishing House, and Workers' Publishing House have published some supplementary materials, they have not published many or systematically due to their respective professional scopes. However, some private speculative publishers have published a large number of crudely made so-called popular reading materials for sale on the market, giving random explanations of national current events and political policies and laws, spreading some incorrect ideas and opinions, and causing great harm to society. In order to change this publishing situation, the General Administration of Publications has been preparing to establish a national popular reading publishing house since June this year. After several months of efforts, it has now been formally established and has initially set up several editorial departments for political reading materials, cultural reading materials, and art, and has begun to work.

    通俗读物出版社在北京成立
    为不断提高广大工农群众和基层干部的政治水平和文化水平，加强通俗读物的出版工作，全国性的通俗读物出版社已在北京成立。
    通俗读物出版社的方针是：以识字二千以上到初中程度的工农兵和基层干部为主要读者，根据国家建设工作和人民文化生活的需要，组织著作力量，编辑、出版通俗图书和期刊，进行马克思列宁主义的常识教育，宣传国家路线、政策、方针、法令，普及文化知识，提高人民群众的思想觉悟、政治水平和文化水平，为逐步地实现国家的社会主义工业化和农业集体化服务。其具体工作任务是：编辑、出版社会科学基础知识，解释时事政治和政策法令的通俗书籍和期刊，以及语文学习、史地、自然科学、文艺等方面的通俗读物。
    全国解放后，广大劳动人民对于各种通俗读物的要求日益增长，各地地方国营出版社虽已出版过一些通俗读物，部分满足了读者的需要，但由于地方出版社的力量及其地方性的限制，还不能完全解决这方面的出版任务，特别是解释政策法令、解释一般基本理论、介绍一般基本知识的任务。中央人民出版社、中国青年出版社、工人出版社虽已附带出过一些，但亦因各有自己的专业范围，出的不多，也不系统。而某些私营投机出版商，则大量出版一些粗制滥造的所谓通俗读物倾销市场，对国家时事政治、政策法令进行胡乱解释，传播一些不正确的思想和言论，对社会贻害很大。出版总署为改变这种出版状况，从今年六月份起即着手筹备建立全国性的通俗读物出版社，经过几个月来的努力，现已正式成立，并已初步设立政治读物、文化读物、美术几个编辑部门，开始进行工作。
