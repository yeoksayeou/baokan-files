　　The locomotive proudly crossed tunnels and bridges, speeding along the newly built Tianshui-Lanzhou line. In the beautiful passenger cars sat workers from the Yumen Oilfield, engineers heading to the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway construction site, state trade workers, and peasants who had been emancipated after the land reform. They talked about the rapid progress of construction in various parts of the motherland. When they saw newly built Western-style houses appearing in the mountain valleys along the railway, and high piles of goods at stations of all sizes, they became more and more excited.

　　With the opening of the railway, new towns appeared along the Tianshui-Lanzhou line. For example, Beidaopu, the terminal station of the Baoji-Tianshui Railway, used to be a barren滩 (beach or flat) with a few dilapidated houses standing askew. Now it has become the starting station of the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway. The houses are neatly built, and on the streets are the People's Bank, Xinhua Bookstore, post office, trade company, coal construction company, internal combustion engine repair factory, workers' club, primary school, and rows of shops and restaurants. With the opening of the railway, the economic life of the citizens improved, and cultural needs also greatly increased. Before the opening of the railway, the Xinhua Bookstore in Beidaopu sold only 3,000 books per month. In the month after the opening, the number of books sold increased to 8,000, and the theater tickets were sold out every day.

　　Small and medium-sized cities along the line have also greatly prospered. The economic face of Tianshui, more than 20 kilometers away from Beidaopu, is changing: the Tianshui Purchasing Office of the Gansu Branch of the China Animal Products Company has increased its funding for the purchase of animal products by more than double after the opening of the railway. The local specialties of farmers and herdsmen can be transported to the interior in large quantities by train, and a large number of industrial products are also continuously transported here. According to statistics from October to December 1952, the sales volume of the main commodities of the Tianshui Department Store, such as sugar, matches, and bicycles, all increased month by month.

　　After the train service opened, freight rates were greatly reduced. Transporting one ton of salt from Lanzhou to Tianshui cost 763,000 yuan by truck, but only 153,000 yuan by train. Transporting one ton of medicinal material Angelica sinensis from Longxi to Tianshui cost 800,000 yuan by horse-drawn carriage, but only 73,000 yuan by train. This greatly promoted the export of local specialties. The rural areas along the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway are rich in local products, but before liberation, the fate of these famous local products was: "Peppercorns are sold as sorghum, and chili peppers rot the bluestone slabs!" After liberation, trade companies adopted the policy of purchasing in rural areas, which solved some of the difficulties in exporting local specialties. After the opening of the railway, the previously unsalable chili peppers of Gangu can now be sold well in Henan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Lanzhou, and Xining. The price has increased from 220,000 yuan to 270,000 yuan per 100 jin. Gangu County used to be hindered in its production development due to the lack of agricultural tools. After the opening of the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway, Gangu can transport cheap agricultural tools from Shanxi and Henan. In the past, an iron hoe cost 7,500 yuan, but now it has been reduced to 1,900 yuan. A mattock used to cost 10,000 yuan, but now it only costs 3,000 yuan. Nowadays, the farmers in Xinxing Township of Gangu County have a new iron hoe, shovel, and mattock in every household.

　　After the opening of the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway, the rural markets along the line have greatly prospered. The market in Luomen Town, Wushan County, has changed from once every three days to once every two days, and the mountain goods market in Tantou Town has also changed from once every five days to once every three days. At the market towns along the railway stations, hemp, rapeseed, vegetable oil, bamboo mats, etc., are piled high every market day, but they are quickly sold out.

　　As the prices of agricultural and sideline products in rural areas increase and the prices of industrial products decrease, farmers can exchange the cloth and daily necessities they need by selling fewer agricultural products, and the economic life of farmers is improving. In 1952, five peasant households (twelve people) in Ningping Village, Qingshui Township, Fourth District, Yuzhong County, cultivated 53.2 mu of land distributed to them, and their agricultural income was 5,362 jin of grain; their sideline production income was 798 jin of grain (wheat), with an average income of 67 jin of grain per person, which was 62.5 jin more than the average sideline production income of 4.5 jin per person before the opening of the railway in 1951. After deducting expenses for the whole year, the five peasant households still had a surplus of 667 jin of grain.

　　When the train, puffing smoke and whistling, passes through the fields and towns, many farmers stand in the fields and wave to the train, and the children clap and cheer. The passengers on the train also happily sing: "Ah, the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway, crossing mountains and ridges, piercing the sky and entering the earth, is like a dragon! Ah, ah – the happy Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway!..."

    天兰路带来的幸福
    洪流
    火车头冒着烟骄傲地穿过隧道大桥，飞驶在新修好的天兰线上。漂亮的旅客车厢里，坐着玉门油矿的工人、到兰新铁路工地去的工程师、国家贸易工作人员，还有土改后翻身的农民。他们谈论着祖国各地突飞猛进的建设情况，当他们看见一座座新盖的洋房出现在铁路沿线的山沟，大小车站上堆满高高的货物时，他们越谈越兴奋。
    随着火车的通车，天兰铁路沿线出现了新的市镇。像宝天铁路的终点站——北道埠，过去是一片荒滩，歪立着几间破房子，如今已成为天兰铁路的起点站了，房子修建得非常整齐，街道上，有人民银行、新华书店、邮局、贸易公司、煤建公司、内燃机修配工厂、工人俱乐部、小学校、林立的商店和饭庄。随着通车，市民经济生活上升起来，文化需要也大大提高了。北道埠的新华书店在通车前，每月只出售三千册书，通车后的那一个月，出售的书籍就增加到八千册，戏园子的票每天都卖得光光的。
    沿线中小城市也大大繁荣起来。离北道埠二十多公里的天水的经济面貌正在变化：中国畜产公司甘肃分公司天水收购处，通车后收购畜产品的资金额增加了一倍以上。农牧民的土特产能大量地经由火车运销内地，大量工业品又源源地运来。天水百货商店主要商品糖、火柴、自行车的销售量，据一九五二年十月到十二月的统计，全是逐月上升。
    火车通后，运费大大降低了，从兰州运一吨盐到天水，汽车运费要七十六万三千元，火车只要十五万三千元。从陇西运一吨药材当归到天水，马车运费要八十万元，火车运费只要七万三千元。这就大大地推动了土特产外销。天兰铁路线上农村的土产是很丰富的，但解放前这些著名土产的遭遇是：“花椒充当高粱卖，辣子沤坏青石板！”解放后贸易公司采用深入乡村收购的方针，解决了土特产外销的一部分困难。火车通后，原先滞销的甘谷的辣子现在能畅销河南、陕西、山西、兰州、西宁了。价格从每百斤二十二万元提高到二十七万元。甘谷县过去因缺少农具阻碍生产发展，天兰铁路通车后，甘谷能从山西、河南运来廉价的农具。过去一个铁铣要七千五百元，现在降低到一千九百元，一把镢头过去要一万元，现在只要三千元。如今甘谷县新兴乡的农家，每户都有一把新式铁铣、铲子和镢头了。
    天兰铁路通车后，沿线集市大大繁荣起来，武山县洛门镇由三日一集市，改为两日一集市，滩头镇的山货集市，也由五日一集市改为三日一集市。沿铁路火车站的集镇，每逢赶集，麻、菜籽、青油、竹席等，都堆得很高很高，但很快就卖光了。
    由于农村的农产品、副产品价格提高，工业品的价格降低，农民出售较少的农产品就能换回所需的布和日用百货品，农民经济生活正在上升。一九五二年榆中县四区清水乡宁坪村的五户农民（十二人），耕种分得的五十三亩二分土地，农业收入五千三百六十二斤粮食；副业生产收入七百九十八斤粮食（小麦），每人平均收入六十七斤粮食，较一九五一年通车前一人平均四斤半副业生产收入要多六十二斤半。全年除去开支外，五户农民尚盈余六百六十七斤粮食。
    当火车冒着烟呜叫着经过田野与城镇时，许多农民站在田里向列车挥手，小孩子们鼓掌欢呼。列车的旅客也高兴地在唱：“啊，天兰铁路，翻山越岭，钻天入地，好似一条龙！啊啊——幸福的天兰路！……”
