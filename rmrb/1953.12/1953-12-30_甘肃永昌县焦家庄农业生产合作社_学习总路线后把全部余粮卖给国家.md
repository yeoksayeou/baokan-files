Jiao Jiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yongchang County, Gansu Province
Sells All Surplus Grain to the State After Studying the General Line

The 264 members of the Jiao Jiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yongchang County, Gansu Province—the largest agricultural production cooperative in Northwest China—decided to sell all of their 410,000 jin of surplus grain to the state after studying the general line, and wrote to Chairman Mao to report their grain sales plan. Currently, they have delivered 60% of the grain sold to state warehouses. This cooperative is located west of Yongchang County, a cold and barren area where most people used to live by working as hired laborers or fleeing famine year-round. People recall the past situation, saying, "Cattle had nothing to eat, horses had no fodder, donkeys were too tired to walk, those plowing the fields were too hungry to stand up straight, and those herding sheep were freezing all over the mountains." After the establishment of the agricultural production cooperative in February of last year, the income of the vast majority of cooperative members nearly doubled compared to before the establishment, with each member earning an average of more than 660 jin of grain. This year, due to further improvements in farming techniques, unified adjustment of crop rotation, and implementation of rational rotation, the cooperative's land achieved an unprecedented comprehensive bumper harvest. Each member's average income will be nearly 1,000 jin of grain, and nine out of ten members have surplus grain. The cooperative has added more than 40 new-style farm implements such as 7-inch and 10-inch walking plows, and is also preparing to buy three horse-drawn harvesters. In just two short years, the cooperative has fundamentally changed its historical poverty. Grain, draft animals, and farm implements have all more than doubled. The members said, "If we hadn't listened to Chairman Mao and organized, how could things have changed so quickly?" Wang Luxian, who had been a hired laborer for 30 years, has already sold more than 1,000 jin of grain to the state this year, and will now sell all of his remaining 570 jin of wheat to the state. He said, "If we want to produce more grain, we must first support industrial construction! With the development of industry, our elder worker brothers can manufacture a large number of new-style farm implements and tractors for us. At that time, we will produce even more grain." After hearing the propaganda about the general line, the members were very happy. In addition to resolving to sell all their surplus grain to the state, they also wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, reporting on the winter production situation of the entire cooperative.
    The letter said: "Although we have made great achievements, we are not satisfied. We want to further improve the cooperative and gradually transition to a fully socialist cooperative (collective farm); and encourage the surrounding peasants to take this path as well. Now, we are accumulating large amounts of manure, summarizing this year's production experience, and planning to expand production next year, striving to produce more grain to sell to the state and support industrial construction."

    甘肃永昌县焦家庄农业生产合作社
    学习总路线后把全部余粮卖给国家
    西北最大的农业生产合作社——甘肃永昌县焦家庄农业生产合作社的二百六十四户社员，在学习了总路线后，决定把全部余粮四十一万斤卖给国家，并上书毛主席报告卖粮计划。目前他们已把卖出的粮食的百分之六十送到国家仓库。这个社在永昌县城西，那地方又寒冷又贫瘠，过去大多数人靠扛长工过活，或终年在外逃荒。人们回忆当年的情景说：“牛没吃的马没料、驴子乏得跌了跤，犁地的饿得直不起腰，放羊的冻得满山跑。”去年二月建立农业生产合作社后，第一年，绝大多数社员的收入比建社前增加近一倍，每个社员平均收入六百六十多斤粮食。今年由于进一步改进耕作技术，统一调整倒茬，实行合理轮作，全社土地获得了空前的全面丰收。每个社员平均收入将近一千斤粮食，十分之九的社员有了余粮。社内已添置了七吋和十吋步犁等新式农具四十余件，还准备买三部马拉收割机。短短两年功夫，全社就基本上改变了历来的贫穷面貌。粮食、耕畜、农具等都增加了一倍以上。社员们说：“要不是听毛主席的话组织起来，光景怎能变得这样快？”当了三十年长工的王禄贤，今年已卖给国家一千多斤粮食，这次还要把剩余的五百七十斤小麦全部卖给国家。他说：“要想再多打粮食，非得首先支援工业建设不可！工业发展了，工人老大哥才能给我们造出大量的新式农具和拖拉机。那时候，打的粮食就更多了。”社员们听到关于总路线的宣传后，非常高兴，除决议把全部余粮卖给国家外，并给毛主席写了一封信，报告全社冬季生产的情形。
    信上说：“虽然我们有了很大成绩，但我们还不满足，我们要进一步办好合作社，逐渐过渡到完全社会主义性质的合作社（集体农庄）；并带动周围农民也走这条路。现在，我们正大量积攒粪土，总结今年的生产经验，计划扩大明年的生产，争取多打粮食卖给国家，支援工业建设。”　（静存）
