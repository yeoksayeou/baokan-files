    Two Contradictions
    Ma Qianzu
    In May, I took advantage of a vacation to return to my hometown. My hometown is a newly liberated area, located in the area traversed by the Tiantai Mountains, a mountainous region. But even such a remote mountainous area screened mobile movies; after watching films of Soviet collective farms, the farmers greatly admired the happy life of Soviet farmers. Two kinds of thoughts existed among the farmers: one was that they were not yet accustomed to mutual aid teams and preferred to work individually. The other was that they welcomed mutual aid and cooperation, and welcomed socialism. They often gathered to discuss: "Our place is mountainous, with most of the land consisting of undulating hillsides, terraced into fields; how can we use tractors to cultivate this?" They were afraid that socialism would not reach the mountainous areas.

    The small-scale individualistic viewpoint and the yearning for a socialist life became the central contradictory thoughts of the farmers there.

    The study of the General Line has been universally launched, with industry and commerce being no exception. It is said that there were two businessmen who, after listening to the reports and undergoing discussions, also realized that the country could only truly prosper, become strong, and be consolidated through socialist transformation; and that private industrial and commercial enterprises could only play a role that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood by taking the road of state capitalism. They also knew that in a socialist society, the means of production are publicly owned, while the means of subsistence are privately owned. They greatly praised the benefits of the General Line and fully supported it! However, one of them asked: "Then what will happen to stocks at that time?" The other continued, "Yes! Stocks rely on factory production to obtain interest. At that time, if the means of production are publicly owned, then stocks will not be able to obtain interest. Then what about the means of subsistence?"—The conclusion was naturally that socialism is good, but it is a pity that stocks will be useless.

    In fact, stocks being useless does not mean that one cannot obtain the means of subsistence. The means of subsistence can be exchanged for by working. However, for those accustomed to living off stocks, this is also a contradictory thought.

    The process of resolving these two contradictions is also the process of our country's socialist transformation.

    两个矛盾
    马前卒
    五月间，利用休假机会回了一次故乡。故乡是新解放区，在天台山脉横亘之处，是山区。但就是这样偏僻的山区，也放过流动电影；农民们看过了苏联集体农庄的影片后，非常羡慕苏联农民的幸福生活。农民间存在着两种思想：一种是还不习惯于互助组，愿意单干。另一种是欢迎互助合作，欢迎社会主义。他们常常聚议：“咱们这里是山地，大半土地靠山坡起伏，开成梯田；这怎么能用拖拉机耕种呢？”他们唯恐社会主义到不了山区。
    单干的小私有观点和对社会主义生活的向往，成为我们那里农民的矛盾思想的中心。
    总路线的学习普遍展开，工商界也无例外。据说，有这样两位商人，听了报告和经过讨论以后，他们也了解到国家只有经过社会主义改造，才能真正繁荣、富强与巩固；而私营工商业也只有走国家资本主义的道路，才能发挥它有利于国计民生的作用。他们也知道：在社会主义社会里，生产资料属于公有，而生活资料却是私有的。他们很称道总路线的好处，并且十分拥护！但是，其中一个发问了：“那么到那时候，股票怎么办呢？”另一个接着说，“是呀！股票是靠工厂生产取息的。到那时候，生产资料公有了，股票也就取不到利息了。那么生活资料呢？”——结论自然是，社会主义好是好，但可惜股票却没有用场了。
    其实，股票没有用场了，不等于拿不到生活资料。生活资料可以用工作去换。然而对惯于靠股票过生活的人来说，这也是一个思想矛盾。
    这两个矛盾的解决过程，也就是我国的社会主义改造过程。
