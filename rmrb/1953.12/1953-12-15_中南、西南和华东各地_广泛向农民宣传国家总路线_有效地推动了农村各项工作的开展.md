Throughout Central South, Southwest, and East China, cadres at all levels, after studying the National General Line for the Transition Period, are now widely engaged in propaganda and education work among farmers. Farmers in various regions, after receiving education on the General Line, have universally responded with practical actions, such as selling surplus grain to the state, expanding production, and actively organizing mutual aid and cooperation, warmly supporting the General Line.

In Central South China, over one million district cadres, township cadres, and peasant activists have already studied the National General Line for the Transition Period. In Hunan Province, except for the Xiangxi Miao Autonomous Region, over 334,000 rural cadres and peasant representatives who have undergone training throughout the province returned to their villages around the 5th of this month, launching a wave of propaganda for the General Line in over 10,000 townships across the province. Farmers who have received education on the General Line are enthusiastically selling their surplus grain to support the country's industrial construction. Farmers in Yannei Township, Hengyang County, and Nanhua Township and Xihua Township, Pingjiang County, have already sold over one million catties of surplus grain, which has been fully delivered to state granaries. Henan Province is currently holding township people's representative conferences and peasant representative congresses, as well as various activist meetings, to conduct propaganda on the General Line among farmers. In Jiangxi Province, as of the 5th of this month, propaganda work has been launched in rural areas of forty-eight counties, and propaganda work in the other thirty-eight counties will also be launched successively. The people of Xingguo County, an old revolutionary base area during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, were very excited after hearing the report on the General Line. More than 800 local cadres who participated in the expanded cadre meeting in the county voluntarily signed up to sell surplus grain from their homes to the state. In Hubei Province, various counties are currently conducting joint township training for a large number of peasant activists to expand the rural propaganda force. In some areas of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, propaganda on the General Line has also begun among farmers.

The scale of this propaganda campaign on the General Line among farmers in Central South China is unprecedented. Leaders of the Communist Party committees, people's governments, and mass organizations at all levels in the region mostly serve as reporters themselves, going deep into various counties, districts, and key villages to give reports on the General Line. Rural propaganda networks, propagandists, slideshows, radio stations, and blackboards have also become active in various places. The propaganda methods in various places mostly start with propaganda based on the farmers' personal experiences and most familiar matters, proceeding from the near to the far. In Huojia County, Henan Province, the fact that the state repaired the Daoqing Railway was used to educate cadres and farmers about the great significance of realizing socialist industrialization for the development of agriculture. Some rural cadres said: "Before the Daoqing Railway was repaired, it took three days to go to the Jiaozuo coal mine to haul coal, and the price was also expensive, one ton of coal required one shi and five dou of corn. Now that the state and workers have repaired the railway and delivered the coal to our doorstep, one ton of coal only requires six dou of corn, this is the benefit that the state's development of industry and the working class give to the farmers." Some areas also use the method of holding physical object exhibitions to educate farmers. For example, in Guangxi Province, fifteen regions used the exhibition method to educate farmers about the benefits of realizing national industrialization, and the number of surplus grain sold by farmers in various places more than doubled. In the process of educating farmers about the socialist future in various places, specific facts are also used to educate farmers to clearly understand the advantages and disadvantages of taking the socialist road and the capitalist road. For example, in Xiuwu County, Henan Province, the fact that 577 households of farmers in 27 villages experienced a decline in their lives due to exploitation was used to educate many cadres and farmers that realizing socialist agricultural cooperation is the only path for farmers to move towards common prosperity. In Central South China, the propaganda of the General Line is closely integrated with production, and the production enthusiasm of farmers in areas that have been publicized has generally increased. After studying the General Line, farmers in Zhengcun Township, Luoyang County, Henan Province, bought more than 13,000 catties of fertilizer in a few days.

Currently, 300,000 district cadres, township cadres, and village cadres in Southwest China have studied the General Line. In order to help cadres in various places do a good job of publicizing the General Line to farmers, the Southwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee recently transferred more than 440 cadres and organized more than 20 work teams to go to Sichuan, Guizhou, and other provinces. The Southwest Administrative Committee's Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy Bureau also organized eleven work teams to go to various provinces to combine agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, animal husbandry, and other investigations to conduct propaganda on the General Line among farmers. Farmers in Longquan, Shiwen, and Mangshui townships in Changning County, Yunnan Province, after being educated on the General Line, enthusiastically sold surplus grain to the state and bought back large quantities of cattle, seeds, etc., preparing to expand production next year. Farmers in Xinzhong and Xinyan villages in Hanyuan County, Xikang Province, in order to support the country's industrial construction, returned all government water conservancy loans after selling their surplus grain to the state. Farmers in Sichuan Province who have been educated on the General Line are not only enthusiastically selling surplus grain to the state, but also actively organizing agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups. After the propaganda of the General Line in Nanlong Township, Nanbu County, 50 households of farmers joined the mutual aid group. In Tuanjie Village, Shuangliu County, six mutual aid groups are preparing to establish agricultural production cooperatives, and five mutual aid groups that were about to collapse have now been consolidated, and farmers who withdrew from the mutual aid groups have also returned to the mutual aid groups. Farmers in Taiping Village, Rongchang County, were extremely excited when they heard the news that the Northeast Xinghuo Collective Farm sold more than one million catties of grain to the state. Mutual aid group members Su Xishan, Wang Xingkui, and others actively demanded the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives. Farmers such as Yang Zhengrong, who had withdrawn from the mutual aid group, returned to the mutual aid group. Farmer Zhang Zhilin, who was unwilling to join the mutual aid group, has now also joined the mutual aid group. In Guizhou Province, 80,000 rural cadres and peasant activists have studied the General Line, and they will also launch propaganda on the General Line throughout the province.

Since November, in areas of East China where propaganda on the General Line has been launched, the production enthusiasm of farmers has also generally increased. More than 500 townships in Shandong Province have launched propaganda on the General Line. After studying the General Line, farmers in Shanggao Township, Tai'an County, sold 175,000 catties of surplus grain to the state in fourteen days, and seven mutual aid groups in the township are preparing to establish agricultural production cooperatives. The Hao Peiying mutual aid group has studied the General Line and actively carried out the manure accumulation movement, and most of the group's 95 mu of wheat fields have been hoeed. After studying the General Line, farmers in Shahe Township and Tantou Township, Licheng County, bought a lot of production materials, and eleven mutual aid groups and more than fifty households of farmers in the two townships are preparing to establish agricultural production cooperatives or join mutual aid groups. Thirty-seven mutual aid groups in Shahe Township are also actively carrying out winter plowing and soil improvement. After studying the General Line, farmers in Menlou Township, Fushan County, also bought a large number of production materials, and farmers in 398 households throughout the township have applied chemical fertilizers to their wheat fields. In the propaganda of the General Line in East China, it generally starts with summarizing the local production achievements and educating farmers with actual examples. In Jiangcun Township, Qu County, Zhejiang Province, the fact that rice production still increased by 10% this year despite the drought, with the help of the government, was used to educate farmers about the state's help to farmers, and the production enthusiasm of farmers throughout the township generally increased. The Wei Xie Niu mutual aid group has bought more than 300 catties of oil cakes and repaired two waterwheels. After analyzing the reasons for the annual bumper harvests after the land reform to farmers in Guankou Township, Minhou County, Fujian Province, the enthusiasm of farmers throughout the township has also generally increased. After studying the General Line, the Gong Yulin mutual aid group in Minzhu Township, Yancheng County, Jiangsu Province, launched a manure accumulation movement. Forty mu of wheat fields were applied with ash manure, and 40% of the 125 mu of paddy fields have been plowed four times. In addition to preparing to sell all 200,000 catties of surplus grain to the state, farmers in the Northwest Township of Su County, Anhui Province, have also generally launched a winter production movement, striving to increase the production of more grain next year.

    中南、西南和华东各地
    广泛向农民宣传国家总路线
    有效地推动了农村各项工作的开展
    中南区、西南区和华东区各级干部学习国家过渡时期的总路线后，正广泛向农民展开宣传教育工作。各地受到总路线教育的农民，普遍以卖余粮给国家、扩大生产和积极组织互助合作的实际行动，热烈拥护总路线。
    中南区已有一百多万区干部和乡干部以及农民积极分子学习了国家过渡时期的总路线。湖南省除湘西苗族自治区外，全省经过学习的三十三万四千多农村干部和农民代表已在五日前后返回乡村，在全省一万多个乡展开了宣传总路线的热潮。受到总路线教育的农民，都踊跃地卖出自己的余粮，支援国家的工业建设。该省衡阳县的盐内乡和平江县南湖乡、西湖乡的农民，已卖出一百多万斤余粮，并全部送入了国家粮仓。河南省现正召开乡人民代表会议和农民代表大会以及各种活动分子会议，向农民进行总路线的宣传。江西省到本月五日，已有四十八个县的宣传工作在农村中展开，其他三十八个县的宣传工作亦将相继展开。第二次国内革命战争时期的老根据地兴国县的人民，听了总路线的报告后都非常兴奋，在县里参加扩大干部会议的八百多名本地干部，都自动报名将家中的余粮卖给国家。湖北省各县现正联乡集训大批农民积极分子，以扩大农村的宣传力量。广东、广西两省的部分地区，也已开始向农民进行总路线的宣传。
    中南区这次向农民宣传总路线的规模是空前巨大的。全区各级中共党委、人民政府和群众团体的负责人，大多都亲自担任报告员，深入各县、各区和重点乡村，进行关于总路线问题的报告。各地的农村宣传网、宣传员、幻灯、广播台、黑板报等也都活跃起来了。各地的宣传方法，大都采取先从农民亲身体验和最熟悉的事情宣传起，由近及远。河南省获嘉县以国家修复道清铁路的事实，教育干部和农民认识了实现社会主义工业化对发展农业的重大意义。有的农村干部说：“道清铁路未修以前，到焦作煤矿拉煤，来回需要三天，价钱又贵，一吨煤要一石五斗玉茭。现在国家和工人修好了铁路，把煤送到家门口，一吨煤才用六斗玉茭，这就是国家发展工业和工人阶级给予农民的好处。”有的地区还采用开实物展览会的方式，向农民进行教育。如广西省有十五个地区用展览会的方法，教育农民认识了实现国家工业化的好处，各地农民出售余粮的数目就增加了一倍多。各地在对农民进行社会主义前途的教育中，也都用具体事实教育农民认清走社会主义道路和走资本主义道路的利害关系。如河南省修武县以二十七个村的五百七十七户农民因受剥削生活下降的事实，教育很多干部和农民认识了实现农业社会主义合作化是农民走向共同富裕的唯一大道。中南各地在宣传总路线中因为密切结合了生产，经过宣传的地区，农民的生产情绪普遍提高。河南省洛阳县郑村乡的农民在学习总路线后，几天内便买肥田粉一万三千多斤。
    西南区目前已有三十万区干部、乡干部和村干部学习了总路线。中共中央西南局为帮助各地干部向农民作好总路线的宣传工作，最近抽调了四百四十多名干部，组织了二十多个工作组，分别到四川、贵州等省。西南行政委员会农林水利局也组织了十一个工作组分别到各省结合农林、水利、畜牧等调查工作，向农民进行总路线的宣传。云南省昌宁县龙泉、石文、漭水等乡的农民，在受到总路线的教育后，都热烈地卖余粮给国家，并买回大批耕牛、种籽等，准备明年扩大生产。西康省汉源县新中、新堰两村的农民为支援国家的工业建设，在将余粮卖给国家后，归还了政府的全部水利贷款。四川省受到总路线教育的农民，不仅踊跃出售余粮给国家，而且积极地组织农业生产合作社和互助组。南部县南隆乡进行总路线的宣传后，有五十户农民参加了互助组。双流县团结村有六个互助组准备建立农业生产合作社，五个互助组原来快垮台了，现在又巩固起来，退出互助组的农民也回到了互助组。荣昌县太平村农民，听到东北星火集体农庄卖给国家一百多万斤粮食的消息，都异常兴奋。互助组员苏锡山、王兴奎等积极要求建立农业生产合作社。退出互助组的农民杨正荣等又回到了互助组。不愿参加互助组的农民张芝林现在也参加了互助组。贵州省已有八万乡村干部和农民积极分子学习了总路线，他们也将在全省展开总路线的宣传。
    华东区自十一月份以来，展开总路线宣传的地区，农民的生产积极性也都普遍高涨。山东省已有五百多个乡展开了总路线的宣传。泰安县上高乡农民学习总路线后，在十四天中便卖给国家十七万五千斤余粮，全乡有七个互助组准备成立农业生产合作社。郝培英互助组学习了总路线，积极开展积肥运动，全组九十五亩麦田大部已经锄过。历城县沙河乡、滩头乡农民学了总路线，买了很多生产资料，两个乡有十一个互助组和五十多户农民准备成立农业生产合作社或参加互助组。沙河乡并有三十七个互助组积极进行冬耕、改良土壤。福山县门楼乡农民在学习了总路线之后，也买了大批的生产资料，全乡已有三百九十八户农民的麦田施了化学肥料。华东各地在宣传总路线中，一般都从总结当地的生产成就入手，以实际事例教育农民。浙江省衢县姜村乡以今年天旱，但在政府帮助下，水稻仍增产一成的事实，教育农民认识了国家对农民的帮助，全乡农民的生产情绪普遍提高。魏卸牛互助组已买了三百多斤油饼，修好了两部水车。福建省闽侯县关口乡给农民分析了土地改革后年年丰收的原因后，全乡农民积极性也都普遍提高。江苏省盐城县民主乡龚玉林互助组学习了总路线，全组开展积肥运动，四十亩麦田施了灰粪，一百二十五亩水田，有百分之四十已耕了四遍。安徽省宿县西北乡的农民除准备把二十万斤余粮全部卖给国家外，也普遍开展了冬季生产运动，争取明年增产更多的粮食。
