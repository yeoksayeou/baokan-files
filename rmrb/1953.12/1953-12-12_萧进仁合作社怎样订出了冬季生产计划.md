　　The Xiao Jinren Agricultural Production Cooperative in Zhangjiahe Village, Third District, Shuoxian County, Shanxi Province, has formulated its winter production plan under the call for increasing production and practicing economy.

　　This year, the crops of the Xiao Jinren Agricultural Production Cooperative grew very well. During the autumn harvest, the cooperative members put forward the slogan "Abundant harvest upon abundant harvest, next year must be better than this year." They tentatively planned to expand the wheat field planting area by 150 mu next year (this year it was 48.6 mu), expand the high-yield area by 280 mu (this year 120 mu), and increase fertilizer application on all land by more than 800 cartloads (this year 460 cartloads), striving to increase the average yield per mu by five dous next year compared to this year.

　　However, as the autumn harvest was about to end, some cooperative members developed thoughts of "winter idleness," "breaking up," and "taking a rest." This contradicted the demand for striving for a bumper harvest next year. Later, this problem was solved by formulating a winter production plan.

　　Conducting Side-Line Production Beneficial to Agriculture

　　The Xiao Jinren Agricultural Production Cooperative convened a management committee meeting and a general membership meeting to discuss the issue of how to carry out winter production, allowing everyone to discuss it. Some suggested going to Datong city to find work, some suggested that everyone should do their own thing in winter, some suggested only engaging in some side-line occupations, and some suggested that side-line occupations should be combined with manure accumulation. After repeated research by everyone, it was considered that the first three opinions were not appropriate and would be detrimental to production next year. The fourth opinion was more appropriate. In this way, based on the actual situation of the cooperative, a tofu workshop and a flour mill were established, and mats were woven. The cooperative chairman, Xiao Jinren, signed contracts with seven government agencies and three schools in the city to supply 400 catties of tofu every day, giving the side-line production an outlet. The cooperative decided to carry out land processing this winter, dig river beach land, heavily smoke and compost manure, and contract twenty toilets in the city, planning to accumulate 500 large cartloads of fertilizer this winter.

　　Reasonable Profit Distribution, "No One Suffers"

　　Having learned from the experiences and lessons of running a flour mill last year, and in order to encourage everyone to participate in winter production, the management committee meeting and the general membership meeting conducted a detailed discussion in advance on the issue of profit distribution for this year's side-line occupations. Five different opinions were put forward at the meeting: First, whoever engages in side-line occupations gets the profit. The second opinion was that the profits obtained from side-line occupations, in addition to paying the cooperative members engaged in side-line production according to the price standard of this year's cooperative workdays, the rest should all be returned to agriculture. The third opinion was that agricultural and side-line occupations should be distributed uniformly. Regardless of what kind of labor one participates in during the winter, one should get a share from the side-line occupation profits according to the amount of labor, and all winter workdays should be counted in agricultural production to distribute the grain harvested next year. The fourth opinion was to uniformly distribute side-line occupation profits only according to the workdays of participating in winter production. The fifth opinion was to uniformly distribute side-line occupation profits to all laborers who participate in winter production this year. However, in order to ensure that neither agricultural nor side-line occupations suffer, the number of workdays spent on agricultural infrastructure construction this winter will be transferred to next year's agricultural workdays account, uniformly distributed with next year's agricultural harvest, and then distributed to cooperative members according to the average number of winter production workdays. Based on the principle of "labor creates value," the cooperative members believed that the first four methods were not as good as the fifth in encouraging production, so they decided to use the fifth opinion for profit distribution. This is what they call the "three no-suffering" distribution method, which means that those engaged in side-line occupations do not suffer, those engaged in agricultural construction do not suffer, and those who do not participate in winter production and go out to find work do not suffer.

　　Investing Side-Line Production Income in Agriculture

　　After the profit distribution method was determined, everyone raised the issues of investment, purchase of fertilizer and agricultural tools for research. Cooperative members with better living conditions advocated distributing less cash and investing more; cooperative members with poorer living conditions advocated distributing more cash and investing less. After everyone's research, based on the spirit of "mutual support between agricultural and side-line occupations, expanding reproduction, and appropriately taking care of cooperative members' immediate expenses," it was decided to invest 60% of this year's side-line production profits in agricultural construction, record the amount invested by the cooperative members in their own names in the investment ledger, accrue interest at the bank interest rate, and return it after the autumn harvest next year; the remaining 40% of the money will be used by the cooperative members themselves to supply household sundries. In this way, everyone had no objections, and the capital for purchasing fertilizer and agricultural tools also increased.

　　Strengthening Policy Study and Improving Business Management

　　In order to ensure that these plans are completed well, the management committee put forward several guarantee measures, which were discussed and approved at the general membership meeting. These measures are: (1) Gradually improve business management. In several winter production activities, according to the different tasks, implement a piece-rate contracting system, determining the quality, quantity, labor requirements, and completion time of the tasks. And according to the nature of winter production, divide it into two brigades: agricultural construction and side-line production, with subordinate flour mill, tofu workshop, weaving and other groups, to carry out production. In the financial accounting system, each group has established income and expenditure ledgers, calculating and settling accounts frequently. (2) Strengthen the study of mutual aid and cooperation policies. Every seven days, take an afternoon to organize cooperative members to collectively study articles related to mutual aid and cooperation; young people and old people should mutually impart technical experience, and learn technical experience from other places; help the four year-round mutual aid groups in the village to consolidate. (3) Strictly implement the reward and punishment system according to the contracting situation.

    萧进仁合作社怎样订出了冬季生产计划
    李冠洋　赵瑞
    山西省朔县三区张家河村萧进仁农业生产合作社，在增产节约的号召下，已经订出冬季生产计划。
    今年萧进仁农业生产合作社的庄稼长得很好。社员们在收秋中，提出了“丰产上加丰产，明年要比今年强”的口号。他们初步计划，明年扩大种植麦田一百五十亩（今年种四十八亩六分），扩大丰产面积地二百八十亩（今年一百二十亩），全部土地增施肥料八百多车（今年四百六十车），争取明年每亩产量平均要比今年提高五大升。
    但是秋收快要结束的时候，一部分社员产生了“冬闲”、“散伙”和“歇一歇”思想。这样一来，就和争取明年丰产的要求发生了矛盾。后来经过订冬季生产计划，才把这个问题解决了。
    进行有利于农业的副业生产
    萧进仁农业生产合作社召开社务委员会和社员大会，提出了如何搞冬季生产的问题，让大家讨论。有的提出到大同城里找活干，有的提出冬季各干各，也有的提出光搞上些副业就算了，还有的提出搞副业要和积肥结合起来进行。经大家再三研究，认为前三种意见都不妥当，对明年生产不利。第四种意见比较合适。这样就根据社里的实际情况，搞一座豆腐坊、一座粉坊，并编织席子。社长萧进仁到城里和七个机关、三个学校订立了每天供给四百斤豆腐的合同，使副业生产有了出路。社里决定在今冬进行土地加工，刨河滩地，大量熏肥、沤肥，并在城里包了二十个厕所，计划要在今冬积够五百大车的肥料。
    合理分红“三不吃亏”
    接受了去年搞粉坊的经验教训，并为了鼓励大家参加冬季生产，社务委员会议上和社员大会上，对今年搞副业分红问题，预先作了详细讨论。会上先后提出五种不同的意见：第一种是谁搞副业谁分红。第二种意见是将副业上所获得的红利，除按今年本社劳动日的价格标准付给搞副业生产的社员外，其余一律归到农业里。第三种意见是农副业统一分红，不管冬季参加什么劳动，都从副业红利中根据劳动多少分得一份，并将冬季的劳动日全部归在农业生产上分明年收获下来的粮食。第四种意见是只按参加冬季生产的劳动日统一分副业红利。第五种意见是今年凡是参加冬季生产的劳动力，统一分副业红利。但为了做到农副业两不吃亏，将今冬参加农业基本建设的劳动日数，移到明年农业劳动日的工账上，统一分明年的农业收获物，再按每个社员冬季生产的劳动日数平均分配补给社员。根据“劳动创造价值”的道理，社员们认为前四种在鼓励生产上都不如第五种好，所以确定以第五种意见来分红。这是他们叫做“三不吃亏”的分配方法，就是搞副业的不吃亏，搞农业建设的不吃亏，不参加冬季生产和出外找工的不吃亏。
    用副业生产所得投资农业
    分红办法确定后，大家又把投资、购买肥料农具等问题提出来作了研究。生活好一些的社员，主张少分现款，多投资；生活较差一些的社员却主张要多分现款少投资。经过大家研究，以“农副业相互支援，扩大再生产和适当照顾社员眼前花费”的精神，确定把今年副业生产所得的百分之六十的红利，投到农业建设上，在投资账簿上把社员所投的金额记在自己名下，按银行利率作息生利，明年秋后归还；下余百分之四十的钱归社员自己来供给家庭零碎花项。这么一来，大家都没意见了，购肥、买农具的本钱也大了。
    加强政策学习改善经营管理
    社务委员会为使这些计划完成得好，提出几项保证措施，在社员大会上讨论通过了。这几项措施是：（一）逐步改善经营管理。在冬季几项生产中，要根据活计的不同，按件实行包工制，确定活计的质量、数量、需工多少，和完成时间。并根据冬季生产的性质，分为农业建设和副业生产两个大队，下设粉坊、豆腐坊、编织等小组，进行生产。在财务会计制度上，每个小组都建立了收支账簿，勤算勤结。（二）加强学习互助合作政策。每七天抽一下午时间组织社员集体学习有关互助合作方面的文章；青年与老年要互相传授技术经验，并学习外地技术经验；帮助本村四个常年互助组巩固起来。（三）按照包工的情况，严格执行奖惩制度。
