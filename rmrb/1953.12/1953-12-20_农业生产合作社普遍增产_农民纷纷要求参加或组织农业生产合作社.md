    Agricultural Production Cooperatives Universally Increase Production
    Peasants Eagerly Request to Join or Organize Agricultural Production Cooperatives

    [Report from this newspaper] By the time of the autumn harvest this year, agricultural production cooperatives across the country had developed to over 14,000. The vast majority of agricultural production cooperatives increased production this year, and members' incomes generally increased as well. This fact has inspired the enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants for taking the socialist road. In various regions, many individual farmers and mutual aid team members are actively requesting to join or organize agricultural production cooperatives.

    In the Northeast region, agricultural production cooperatives have developed to 4,874 this year. Most agricultural production cooperatives have implemented the principle of focusing on agricultural production, achieving "good production, fewer burdens, light debts, and less waste." As a result, production has increased, and members' incomes have grown. According to a survey of 312 agricultural production cooperatives in nine counties including Shuangcheng and Lalin in Songjiang Province, Keshan, Suihua, and Kaitong in Heilongjiang Province, Yongji in Jilin Province, Chaoyang in Rehe Province, Zhangwu in Liaoxi Province, and Hailong in Liaodong Province, over 88 percent of the agricultural production cooperatives had better production performance than mutual aid teams. The three agricultural production cooperatives of Gaokan, Xinglong, and Bajiazi in the suburbs of Shenyang City achieved bumper harvests this year by promoting the high-yield experience of Zhaoyuan County, using new-style farm tools, and applying chemical fertilizers, and they created high yields over large areas.

    In the North China region, 6,186 agricultural production cooperatives with 120,000 peasant households participating mostly achieved bumper harvests this year. The autumn fields of 984 agricultural production cooperatives in the Changzhi Special District of Shanxi Province achieved an average yield of 310 jin and 10 liang per mu, an increase of 23 percent over last year, exceeding the average yield per mu of all farmers in the special district by 30.2 percent, and exceeding the average yield per mu of all mutual aid teams in the special district by 23.5 percent. The output of the Changjiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fengrun County, Hebei Province, was 25 percent higher than the average yield per mu of ordinary farmers. The average yield per hectare of the Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Left Wing Middle Banner of Horqin, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, almost doubled the normal yield this year.

    According to preliminary statistics in the East China region, there were 2,301 agricultural production cooperatives before the autumn harvest this year, and the crops of the vast majority of agricultural production cooperatives increased in yield. According to statistics from 757 agricultural production cooperatives in Shandong Province this autumn, 691 had increased production compared to last year, with the largest increase reaching 50 percent; only 66 had reduced production compared to last year due to natural disasters. Among the 38 agricultural production cooperatives in Xindeng County, Zhejiang Province, 25 increased their agricultural and sideline production; 12 agricultural production cooperatives reduced agricultural production due to natural disasters, but if sideline production was included, their income still increased; only one agricultural production cooperative reduced production by 10 percent compared to last year due to more severe disasters, but it still exceeded local mutual aid teams by 115 jin and individual farmers by 124 jin. In addition, the vast majority of agricultural production cooperatives not only achieved the goal of increasing production this year, but also reduced costs. According to inspections in Shandong Province, general production costs have been reduced by about 20 percent compared to last year, and some have even been reduced by 40 percent.

    In the Central and South China region, agricultural production cooperatives have developed to 527 this year, and most harvests have been better than those of individual farmers. In the Xinxiang Special District of Henan Province, the average yield per mu of 108 agricultural production cooperatives was 17.6 percent higher than the average yield per mu of 108 mutual aid teams with the same natural conditions, and 25.3 percent higher than the average yield per mu of 108 villages in the area. The Su Dianxuan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Lushan County harvested an average of 306 jin of wheat per mu, the better Zhou Yulin mutual aid team in the area had an average yield of 179 jin per mu, and the average yield per mu of individual farmers in the area was only 124 jin. According to statistics from 2,624 mu of paddy fields in the 25 agricultural production cooperatives in Hunan Province that were established on a trial basis this year, the average yield per mu this year was about 10 percent higher than that of general mutual aid teams and about 20 percent higher than that of general individual farmers.

    In the Northwest region, according to incomplete statistics, there are already 302 agricultural production cooperatives. This year, the harvest of crops from most agricultural production cooperatives has been greater than that of mutual aid teams and individual farmers. For example, the harvest of 90 agricultural production cooperatives in Mizhi County, Shaanxi Province, was 10 to 25 percent higher than that of local mutual aid teams and 30 to 66 percent higher than that of individual farmers.

    In the Southwest region, according to statistics before the autumn harvest, there are already 59 agricultural production cooperatives. This year, agricultural production cooperatives have shown their superiority in increasing production, and production has increased significantly. For example, the average yield per mu of rice in 11 agricultural production cooperatives such as Guo Tianjin in Sichuan Province exceeded the average yield of the entire province by 38 percent this year. Eight of the nine agricultural production cooperatives in Yunnan Province increased production by about 10 percent compared to last year.

    This year, most agricultural production cooperatives in various regions adopted the principle of paying primarily according to labor and providing reasonable remuneration for means of production such as land, carts, horses, and farm tools, and conscientiously carried out autumn harvest distribution work. With the increase in production, the income of members has generally increased. For example, the average income per household in 23 agricultural production cooperatives in Boli County, Songjiang Province, is between 20,000 and 35,000 jin of grain. The actual income of members of the Yang Yanrong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wenxi County, Shanxi Province, this year exceeded last year's by one to two times, and for those with strong labor power, the highest exceeded more than five times. The 30 households and 131 people in the Ma Tinghai Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dali County, Shaanxi Province, had an average grain income of about 1,500 jin per person, which is 50 to 60 percent more than ordinary individual farmers in the area. The income of members of the newly established agricultural production cooperatives in the Central and South China region this year is also higher than before joining the cooperatives. For example, among the 51 peasant households in the four agricultural production cooperatives newly established this spring in Wen County, Henan Province, 22 households increased their income by 100 to 500 jin compared to before joining the cooperatives, 21 households increased their income by 500 to 1,000 jin, and eight households increased their income by more than 1,000 jin. Agricultural production cooperatives in the Southwest region had higher incomes this year than last year. For example, a survey of the income of 124 households in eight cooperatives in Sichuan Province showed that 95 percent of the households increased their income compared to last year, of which more than 30 percent of the total number of households increased by more than 30 percent.

    The increase in production of agricultural production cooperatives and the increase in the income of members have made the broad masses of peasants further realize the superiority of organized production. Peasants in various regions have requested to join or establish new agricultural production cooperatives. According to statistics from the Changzhi Special District in Shanxi Province, after the autumn harvest, 134 mutual aid teams and 2,600 individual farmers in the district actively requested to establish and join agricultural production cooperatives. In 31 villages in Huguan County, Shanxi, more than 300 peasant households and 42 mutual aid teams requested to join and establish agricultural production cooperatives. Based on the actual situation, the Huguan County Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to build 44 more agricultural production cooperatives and plans to focus on cultivating an agricultural production cooperative with more than 100 households. In Boyan Township, Wu'an County, Hebei Province, eight mutual aid teams requested to be transformed into agricultural production cooperatives. In the Left Wing Middle Banner of Horqin, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region alone, 1,200 peasant households and more than 60 year-round mutual aid teams requested to establish or join agricultural production cooperatives. In Wuzhi County, Henan Province, 91 members of 12 agricultural production cooperatives hesitated and wavered before the autumn harvest distribution; after the distribution, not only did they all stabilize, but more than 30 peasant households requested to join. In the Xinxiang Special District, more than 20 new agricultural production cooperatives were established during the autumn harvest and wheat planting, and more than 560 other peasant households requested to join.

    In order to further develop and consolidate mutual aid and cooperation organizations, Party and government organs in various regions are strengthening their leadership over the mutual aid and cooperation movement and formulating development plans for this winter and next spring based on the demands of the masses and local conditions. Some regions are actively training mutual aid team leaders and backbone members who are requesting to be reorganized into agricultural production cooperatives, and are summarizing experiences to prepare conditions for organizing more agricultural production cooperatives this winter and next spring.

    农业生产合作社普遍增产
    农民纷纷要求参加或组织农业生产合作社
    【本报讯】全国各地农业生产合作社，到今年秋收前后已发展到一万四千多个。今年绝大多数农业生产合作社增加了生产，社员也普遍增加了收入。这个事实鼓舞了广大农民走社会主义道路的热情。各地许多单干农民和互助组组员积极要求参加或组织农业生产合作社。
    东北区今年农业生产合作社已发展到四千八百七十四个。大部分农业生产合作社贯彻了以农业生产为主的方针，做到了“生产好、摊子少、债务轻、浪费少”，因此，生产提高，社员收入增多。据松江省的双城、拉林，黑龙江省的克山、绥化、开通，吉林省的永吉，热河省的朝阳，辽西省的彰武和辽东省的海龙等九个县试办的三百十二个农业生产合作社调查，百分之八十八以上的农业生产合作社生产成绩都比互助组好。沈阳市郊高坎、兴隆和八家子三个农业生产合作社今年因为推广肇源县的丰产经验，使用了新式农具和施用化学肥料，获得了丰收，并创造了大面积的高额产量。
    华北区有十二万农户参加的六千一百八十六个农业生产合作社，今年大多数丰产。山西省长治专区九百八十四个农业生产合作社的秋田每亩平均产量达到三百一十斤零十两，比去年增产百分之二十三，超过全专区农民每亩平均产量百分之三十点二，超过全专区互助组每亩平均产量百分之二十三点五。河北省丰润县常家庄农业生产合作社的产量，比一般农民每亩平均多收百分之二十五。内蒙古自治区科尔沁左翼中旗前进农业生产合作社，今年每垧地的平均产量几乎超过了常年产量一倍。
    华东区据初步统计，今年秋收前已有农业生产合作社二千三百零一个，绝大多数农业生产合作社的农作物都增加了产量。山东省今年秋天据七百五十七个农业生产合作社统计，有六百九十一个比去年增产，其中增产最多的达百分之五十，只有六十六个因受天灾比去年减产。浙江省新登县三十八个农业生产合作社中有二十五个的农副业产量都增加了；十二个农业生产合作社因受天灾，在农业上减产，但如果加上副业，收入仍是增加的；只有一个农业生产合作社因灾情较重，比去年减产一成，但与当地互助组比较，仍超过一百十五斤，与单干农民比较，超过一百二十四斤。此外，绝大多数农业生产合作社在今年不仅达到了增产的目的，而且还降低了成本。据山东省检查，一般的生产成本都比去年降低百分之二十左右，有的甚至降低百分之四十。
    中南区的农业生产合作社今年发展到五百二十七个，大部分的收成都比单干农民强。河南省新乡专区有一百零八个农业生产合作社每亩的平均产量，比同等自然条件的一百零八个互助组每亩平均多收百分之十七点六，比当地的一百零八个村的每亩平均产量高出百分之二十五点三。鲁山县苏殿选农业生产合作社每亩平均收三百零六斤小麦，当地较好的周玉林互助组每亩平均产量为一百七十九斤，而当地的单干农民每亩平均产量才一百二十四斤。湖南省据今年试办的二十五个农业生产合作社的二千六百二十四亩稻田的统计，今年每亩平均产量比一般互助组高出百分之十左右，比一般单干农民高出百分之二十左右。
    西北区，据不完全统计，已有三百零二个农业生产合作社。今年大多数农业生产合作社农作物的收获量都比互助组和单干农民为多。如陕西省米脂县的九十个农业生产合作社的收获量比当地互助组就高出百分之十到二十五，比单干农民高出百分之三十到六十六。
    西南区，据秋收前统计，已有五十九个农业生产合作社。今年农业生产合作社在增产方面显示了优越性，增产很多。如四川省郭天金等十一个农业生产合作社，今年水稻每亩平均产量超过全省平均产量百分之三十八。云南省九个农业生产合作社中有八个比去年增产百分之十左右。
    各地农业生产合作社，今年大部分采取以按劳取酬为主并对土地、车马、农具等生产资料给予合理报酬的原则，认真进行了秋收分配工作。随着生产的提高，社员的收入普遍增加。如松江省勃利县二十三个农业生产合作社，平均每户可收入两万到三万五千斤粮。山西省闻喜县杨彦荣农业生产合作社社员今年的实际收入超过去年一倍到两倍，劳力强的，最多的超过五倍多。陕西省大荔县马廷海农业生产合作社三十户一百三十一人，平均每人的粮食收入约达一千五百斤，比当地一般的单干农民多百分之五十到六十。中南区今年新成立的农业生产合作社的社员，收入也比入社前为多。例如河南省温县今春新建立的四个农业生产合作社五十一户农民的收入，比他们未入社前增加一百斤到五百斤的有二十二户，增加五百斤到一千斤的二十一户，一千斤以上的八户。西南区农业生产合作社今年收入比去年强，如四川省调查了八个社一百二十四户的收入，百分之九十五的户都比去年增加了收入，其中增加百分之三十以上的占总户数的一半。
    农业生产合作社的增产以及社员收入的增加，使广大农民进一步认识了组织起来生产的优越性，各地农民纷纷要求加入或新建立农业生产合作社。据山西省长治专区统计：在秋收以后，该区就有一百三十四个互助组和二千六百户个体农民积极要求建立和参加农业生产合作社。山西壶关县在三十一个村中，就有三百多农户和四十二个互助组要求加入和建立农业生产合作社。中共壶关县委根据实际情况，已决定增建农业生产合作社四十四个，并计划重点培养一个百户以上的农业生产合作社。河北省武安伯延乡，就有八个互助组要求转为农业生产合作社。内蒙古自治区仅科尔沁左翼中旗就有一千二百户农民、六十多个常年互助组要求成立或参加农业生产合作社。河南省武陟县十二个农业生产合作社在秋收分配前有九十一户社员犹豫动摇；分配后，不但全部稳定下来，并有三十多户农民要求参加。新乡专区在秋收种麦中，新建农业生产合作社二十多个，另有五百六十多户农民要求参加。
    为了更进一步发展和巩固互助合作组织，各地党政机关正在加强对互助合作运动的领导并根据群众的要求和当地情况，制定今冬明春的发展计划。有的地区正积极训练要求改建为农业生产合作社的互助组组长和骨干，并总结经验，为今冬明春组织更多的农业生产合作社准备条件。
