    Rural Workers Should Learn from Davydov
    ——After Reading the Soviet Novel "Virgin Soil Upturned"
    Pan Jiqiong
    The novel "Virgin Soil Upturned," set against the backdrop of the village of Gremyachy Log around the spring plowing of 1930, brilliantly depicts the tortuous process of the growth of a Soviet collective farm and shapes the typical image of a rural worker, Davydov, who is worthy of emulation.
    People remember that 1930 was the beginning of the period when the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) was fighting to realize agricultural collectivization. Comrade Stalin, in arguing for the significance of agricultural collectivization, wrote: "The last hope of capitalists in all countries that capitalism would be restored in the Soviet Union, namely the 'sacred principle of private property,' has collapsed and turned to ashes. The peasantry, which they considered to be the nourishment of capitalism, has abandoned the banner of that praised 'private system' and embarked on the path of the collective system, the path of socialism." ("Problems of Leninism," page 374) However, educating the broad masses of peasants to abandon the banner of the "private system" was not a simple process, but a sharp struggle of ideological consciousness, a profound revolution. The author of the novel "Virgin Soil Upturned," Mikhail Sholokhov, with tremendous artistic generalization, portrayed the reality of that era, inspiring people to advance towards a greater victory of the movement.
    The small-peasant economy can never escape poverty. However, as the middle peasant Mettalnikov says in the novel, there are still many people in the countryside who "can't see anything except their own cow and their own chicken coop." Those people think, "It's very bad, but it's my own." Therefore, they are defenders of the private system, and even in the process of accepting socialist transformation, they inevitably retain a corrosive attachment to private ownership. Look: In the collective farm's stable, several villagers came one day, and they asked the administrator:
  “'Did you give a little hay to my chestnut horse?' 'Did you spread some bedding for my brindle fellow?' 'Is my little mare doing well in the stable?'" Each of them tried their best to get more hay for their own horse.
    Even the activists, the middle peasant Mettalnikov, was once troubled by this corrosive attachment to private ownership. He engaged in ideological struggle late at night, struggling in these thoughts like a fish in a net. He thought to himself: "When will you leave me, damned nostalgia? When will you be extinguished, you dangerous demon? But, what is the reason for this? I pass by the stable, and I don't feel anything when I see other people's horses standing there. But as soon as I walk up to my own horse... I start to suffocate, at that time, it seems even closer than my wife... Others are the same: everyone loves his own horse and doesn't care about others' horses. But now there is no 'other people's,' they are all ours." (page 119)
    Here, people see how arduous the educational work of guiding peasants onto the socialist road is. And arduousness precisely implies the profound content of the revolution.
    From the novel, we see that the peasants finally abandoned the banner of the "private system" that they praised and cherished. Mettalnikov gradually became the most outstanding shock worker in the village; the most stubborn Anikin family handed over the grain they were supposed to hand over; Demid, who had once withdrawn from the collective farm, is now working like a strong bull. Rogalio, an idle rural woman, also joined the shock brigade and went to the fields. The backward Antrop Grazhi, after returning home at night, proudly said, "Our family isn't lagging behind either!"
    How to fully estimate the characteristics of the peasants, that is, on the one hand, they are laborers, and on the other hand, they are infatuated with the private system, and how to guide them towards socialism is a very complex problem. In this regard, let all rural workers learn from Davydov.
    Davydov, as depicted by the novelist, is such a figure: a former Red Navy soldier, a metalworker with nine years of seniority, who came to the village of Gremyachy Log in early 1930 as a district committee representative to carry out comprehensive collectivization work. He not only lived a hard and simple life, working diligently and conscientiously, but also always adhered to the correct line of the Party, insisting on persuading peasants to join the collective farm based on the principle of voluntariness. He worked in such an environment: For a period of time, the secretary of the district committee made mistakes, and Razmetnov, the chairman of the Soviet who worked with Davydov in the village to lead the collective farm, was paralyzed to the harm of the rich peasants; the village branch secretary, Ragulnov, although a party member infinitely loyal to the Party, consistently used administrative orders to force peasants to participate, even violating laws and disciplines, and once threatened middle peasants with a pistol. Reactionaries and rich peasants in the village conspired to riot, spread rumors, and seized every opportunity to sabotage this major cause. The Cossack laboring peasants, in the beginning, did not understand well enough the benefits that the collective farm could give to the motherland and themselves; the deeply rooted consciousness of the private property system appeared from time to time. All of these greatly affected the consolidation and development of the collective farm.
    The work facing Davydov was arduous. The masses first raised various questions, such as "Will everything be public?" "What about the houses?" "Is the collective farm temporary or permanent?" "What about those who work individually? Will their land be confiscated?" "Will we eat together?" The peasants' thinking that Davydov encountered was this kind of thinking: "We should have people join the collective farm like this: those who work diligently and have livestock join one farm, the poor join another, the rich join another, and the lazy must be sent to the political police to educate them on how to work. It's no good putting everyone together, it will never produce any results." (page 53)
    If this were done, it would disintegrate the ranks of laboring peasants: the poor and middle peasants would be opposed to each other, the progressive and the backward would be opposed to each other, thus benefiting the class enemies, which is obviously not the collectivization we need. Doing so would not enable an effective socialist transformation of agriculture.
    Look again at a conversation between the peasant Rosalia and Davydov:
    "...I want to see what life will be like in the collective farm. If life is good, I'll sign; if not, why should I join? Only stupid fish swim into the net..."
      "That's right!"
      "Let's wait a while before joining."
    "Let others try the new life first!"
    "Come if you're happy! What's there to try? Is the collective farm a girl?" (page 55)
    Under these circumstances, Ragulnov's "hard drag" method was definitely unworkable. He once said: "Even if we bury ourselves in the soil, we will drag everyone into the collective farm" (page 26). But Davydov, firmly grasped the Party's policy towards the peasants, gave patient persuasion and gradual guidance to all kinds of peasants, and used examples to illustrate that agricultural collectivization was superior to the individual peasant economy, so that the peasants went from doubt to conviction.
    In dealing with the riots caused by the rich peasants spreading rumors in the village, Davydov demonstrated the Bolsheviks' high degree of responsibility and principled spirit. The rich peasants incited the peasants to slaughter their livestock, saying, "Slaughter them, they're not ours now!" "Slaughter them, if you don't slaughter them, they'll be requisitioned as meat" this kind of ghost story, half of the horned livestock in the whole village was quickly reduced. Ragulnov, angered by the incident of deliberately slaughtering livestock, and concerned about the difficulties of spring plowing and sowing, insisted on passing a resolution to make all the villagers' livestock, even poultry, entirely public. The scope of public ownership was not limited to the basic means of production, but recklessly extended to self-use dairy cows, small livestock, and poultry, which was a "child's play of collectivization." Sure enough, the rumors quickly spread. The old women went to Razmetnov to question him. Because they heard that "the chickens made public would be sent to the city to make soup," and that the farm lacked steam incubators, so "there is a special small chair, with grass underneath, made for the old women, who will be forced to sit in those chairs to hatch eggs, and those who refuse to hatch will be tied to the chairs." (page 122)
    This was not a joke. Davydov realized that this was a "leftist" mistake caused by blind collectivization, and insisted on immediately correcting it in accordance with the Party's policy, and in fact it was corrected. Davydov knew that any blindly rash action could only cause avoidable disturbances in the countryside. This disturbance could no longer be allowed to expand. Davydov blamed Ragulnov: "You're always like this, as soon as there's a little bit of chaos, you immediately go to extremes." He also advised him: "You should do more mass work and explain our policy." (page 102)
    Davydov's life in the countryside was arduous. In addition to two changes of shirts, socks, and a suit of clothes, his luggage contained simple tools that he had brought to repair tillage machines. He slept on a large cabinet. He was very satisfied with a gift from a friend in Leningrad that wasn't even worth a ruble. He often read the "Pravda" and "Hammer" newspapers late at night, read books, and read agricultural magazines. When difficulties occurred in his work, the shadow of depression once swept across his face, but he recognized the complexity of the class struggle and immediately cheered up. He was beaten on the head by Timofei, the son of a rich peasant, with an iron bar, causing him to bleed. He was even abused and beaten by the women on the farm, but he did not remember the damage done to him by the simple peasants, saying: "Bolsheviks have no intention of revenge, they only want to punish their enemies without mercy. But even if you leave the collective farm...and beat us, we do not regard you as enemies. You are temporarily misguided wavering middle peasants. We will not take any administrative measures against you. We want to make you aware." (page 253) Wherever the collective farm movement suffered setbacks, he rushed there. At the important juncture of spring plowing, he personally went to the fields to plow the land, plowing one hectare a day, causing his back to ache and his feet to be rubbed raw by his boots, but when he lay down at night, he only saw "the black soil disturbingly flowing before his eyes again, the white edge of the plow silently sliding, and beside it, the soil constantly changing shape, rolling and boiling like black oil, feeling a little dizzy..." (page 269)
    Davydov is such a respectable worker, who disregards all opposition, adheres to the correct line of the Party, and earnestly understands the spirit of the policy. In his work, he did not rush ahead, distancing himself from the masses, nor did he fall behind the masses. He dedicated his infinite loyalty to the cause of the Party, to the "Stalin Collective Farm."
    The virgin land has been reclaimed, and Davydov's image has lived in people's hearts for twenty or thirty years, encouraging people to advance victoriously on the road of agricultural collectivization.

    农村工作者应该向达维多夫学习
    ——苏联小说“被开垦的处女地”读后
    潘际坰
    小说“被开垦的处女地”以一九三○年春耕前后的格内米雅其村为背景，出色地描绘了一个苏联集体农庄成长的曲折过程，塑造了达维多夫这样一个足资效法的农村工作者的典型。
    人们记得，一九三○年正是联共（布）党为实现农业集体化而斗争的时期的开端。斯大林同志在论证农业集体化的意义时，写道：“各国资本家妄想在苏联会恢复资本主义的最后一点希望，即‘神圣的私有原则’，已在崩溃而化为灰烬。他们所认为是资本主义滋养料的农民，已纷纷抛弃那所赞美的‘私有制度’的旗帜，而走上了集体制度的轨道，走上了社会主义的轨道。”（“列宁主义问题”第三七四页）可是，教育广大农民抛弃“私有制度”的旗帜，并不是简单的过程，而是一场尖锐的思想意识的斗争，是一个极深刻的革命。小说“被开垦的处女地”的作者萧洛霍夫，以巨大的艺术概括力，表现了那个时代的真实，激励人们向运动的更大胜利前进。
    小农经济绝对摆脱不了贫困的境地。可是，正如小说里的中农梅谭尼可夫所说，农村里依然有不少“除了自己的母牛和自己的鸡笼以外再看不见什么的人”。那些人的想法是：“东西很蹩脚，但是是我自己的。”因而他们是维护私有制度的，甚至在接受了社会主义改造的过程中，还不免对于私有制残存着一种腐蚀性的眷恋。请看：在集体农庄的马厩里，有一天来了好几个庄员，他们问管理员：
  “‘你拿了一点干草给我的那匹栗马吃吗？’‘你替我那黄褐色的家伙铺了点卧藁没有？’‘我的小母马好好地在马厩里吗？’”他们每个人都竭力要多拿点干草给他自己的马吃。
    就是积极分子、中农梅谭尼可夫，也曾一度为这种对私有制的腐蚀性的眷恋所困扰。他在深夜里进行思想斗争，他像鱼在网里一样的在这些思想里挣扎。他心想：“你要到什么时候才离开我呢，该诅咒的怀恋？什么时候你才会灭绝呢，你这危险的魔鬼。但是，这个到底是什么道理？我从马厩旁边经过，别人的马，站在那里，我一点也不感到什么。但是一走到我自己的马的面前，……我就开始窒息了，那时候，它好像比我的老婆还要亲近。……别的人也是一样：每个人都爱他自己的马，别人的就毫不关心。但是，现在并不是什么‘别人’的了，它们都是我们的。”（页一一九）
    人们在这里看到引导农民走上社会主义道路这件教育工作是如何的艰巨。而艰巨正意味着革命的深刻的内容。
    从小说里看到，农民终于纷纷抛弃了他们所赞美眷恋的“私有制度”的旗帜。梅谭尼可夫逐渐成为全村最优秀的突击工人；村里最顽固的安金姆一家，缴出了应缴的谷物；一度退出集体农庄的代米德，如今像一只强壮的公牛似的在工作着。罗加里亚，一个游手好闲的农村妇女，也参加了突击队，下了田。落后的安脱普·格拉支晚上回家以后，自豪地说：“我们一家也没有落后呀！”
    如何充分估计到农民的特点，即一面是劳动者，一面又是私有制度的迷恋者，并引导他们走向社会主义，是个很复杂的问题。在这方面，让所有的农村工作者，向达维多夫学习吧。
    小说作者笔下的达维多夫是这样一个人物：当过红海军战士，有九年工龄的金属工人，一九三○年初以区委代表的身份到格内米雅其村进行全面集体化工作。他非但在生活上艰苦朴素，任劳任怨，而且始终坚持党的正确的路线，坚持以自愿原则说服农民参加集体农庄。他工作在这样一个环境里：有一个时期区委书记犯了错误，而在村里和达维多夫共同领导集体农庄工作的苏维埃主席拉兹米推洛夫，对富农的危害性是麻痹的；村支部书记拉古尔洛夫，虽然是一个对党无限忠诚的党员，却一贯地运用行政命令强迫农民参加，甚至违法乱纪，曾以手枪威胁中农。村里有反动分子和富农阴谋暴动，散布谣言，在抓住一切机会破坏这一重大的事业。哥萨克劳动农民呢，最初对集体农庄所能给予祖国与自己的利益还不够了解；根深蒂固的私有财产制的意识，时隐时现。所有这些，都大大影响了集体农庄的巩固和发展。
    摆在达维多夫面前的工作是艰巨的。群众首先提出种种问题，例如“一切东西都要公有吗？”“屋子怎么办？”“集体农庄是一时的呢，还是永久的？”“那些各自干的人怎么办呢？他们的土地会被没收吗？”“我们要一道吃饭吗？”达维多夫碰到的农民的思想，是这样的一种想法：“我们要人们加入集体农庄应当这样：那些工作辛勤而且有牲口的人加入一个农庄，穷的人加入另外一个，富裕的人又加入另外一个，而懒惰的人一定要送到政治警察局去教育他们怎样去工作。把所有的人弄到一块是没有益处，那决不会弄出什么结果。”（页五三）
    如果照这样做了，就要使劳动农民的队伍瓦解：贫农和中农对立，进步的和落后的对立，因而有利于阶级敌人，显然不是我们所需要的集体化。这样做，便不能对农业进行有效的社会主义的改造。
    再看农民罗西里亚和达维多夫的一段对话：
    “……我要看看在集体农庄中将是这样一种生活。要是生活好，我就签名；要是不，我为什么要加入？只有笨鱼才游到网里去……”
      “那是对的！”
      “我们等一下再加入。”
    “让别人先在尝试新的生活罢！”
    “高兴就来！有什么好试的？集体农庄难道是姑娘吗？”（页五五）
    在这些情况下，拉古尔洛夫的“硬拖”的办法是断然行不通的。他曾说：“我们就是把自己埋进土里去，也要把每一个人拖进集体农庄来”（页二六）。而达维多夫，却是紧紧掌握住党对待农民的政策，对各种各样的农民给予耐心的说服与逐步的诱导，用实例说明农业集体化比个体的农民经济要来得优越，使农民从怀疑到心服。
    在应付村里由于富农制造谣言，引起骚乱的时候，达维多夫表现了布尔什维克高度负责和原则精神。富农煽动农民杀掉家畜，并说什么：“杀罢，现在不是我们的了！”“杀罢，要是你不杀的话，他们会把它作为兽肉征收拿去”这一套鬼话，全村有角的牲口很快地减少了一半。为故意屠杀牲畜事件所激怒的拉古尔洛夫，顾虑到春耕播种的困难，于是坚持通过决议，把庄员们的大小牲畜，甚至家禽，全部作为公有。公有化的范围不限于基本生产资料，而鲁莽地扩大到自用奶牛、小牲畜和家禽的身上去，这是“集体化的儿戏。”果然，谣言很快地传开了。老太婆们到拉兹米推洛夫面前大兴问罪之师。因为她们听说“鸡充了公是要送到城里去做汤吃的”，又听说农庄缺少蒸气孵卵机，所以“有一种特别的小小的椅子，底下铺着草，是做给老妇人用的，她们要被强迫坐在那种椅子上去孵蛋，那些不肯孵的人，会被他们绑在椅子上。”（页一二二）
    这不是一个玩笑。达维多夫认识到这是由于盲目公有化所造成的“左倾”的错误，并且坚持主张依照党的政策，立刻加以纠正，事实上也纠正过来了。达维多夫知道，任何盲目冒进的行动，只能在农村里造成原是可以避免的纷扰。这纷扰不能再让它扩大。达维多夫责备拉古尔洛天：“你老是这样，有一点点混乱，你就马上走极端。”又劝告他说：“你还是多做点群众工作，说明我们的政策。”（页一○二）
    达维多夫在农村里的生活是艰苦的。行囊里除了两件换洗的衬衫、短袜和一套衣服外，便是带去准备修理耕种机的简单工具。睡在一张大柜上。列宁格勒的朋友带给他连一个卢布也不值的礼物，他已经非常满意了。他时常在深夜看“真理报”、“铁锤报”，读书，翻阅农业杂志。在工作发生困难的时候，烦闷的阴影也曾从他面前掠过，但是他认识到阶级斗争的复杂性，马上振奋起来。他被富农的儿子铁摩菲用铁棒打得头破血流。他甚至被农庄上的妇女们辱骂和殴伤，可是他一点也不记着质朴的农民们所加给他的毁伤，他说：“布尔什维克是没有复仇的心意的，他们只是要没有饶恕地惩罚他们的仇敌。但是纵令你们脱离了集体农庄……打了我们，我们并不把你们当做敌人。你们是暂时走错了路的动摇的中农。我们不会对你们采取任何行政上的处分的。我们要使你们觉悟。”（页二五三）集体农庄运动中什么地方受了挫折，他就赶到那里去。在春耕的重要关头，他亲自下田耕地，一天耕了一公顷，弄得腰酸背痛，脚也给长靴擦伤了，但是到晚上他躺下来，只见“黑的泥土又在他的眼前扰人的流动，犁嘴的白色的锋口无声的滑动着，在它的旁边，不断的改变形象的泥土，像黑油一样的翻滚、沸腾，感到有点晕眩……”（页二六九）
    达维多夫是这样一个可敬的工作者，他不顾一切反对，坚持党的正确路线，认真体会政策的精神。在工作中他没有一马当先，远离群众，也没有落在群众的后面。他以无限的忠诚献给党的事业，献给“斯大林集体农庄”。
    处女地被开垦了，达维多夫的形象，二三十年一直活在人们的心里，鼓舞人们往农业集体化的道路胜利前进。
