**Preface**

On June 25, 1950, the U.S. government launched an invasion of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. During this war, the U.S. military authorities seriously violated the Geneva Conventions and principles of international law, subjecting Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured to various forms of persecution and torture, including massacres.

The Chinese Red Cross Society, in order to uphold humanitarian principles and defend the Geneva Conventions and principles of international law, visited the Chinese People's Volunteers who had been repatriated, listened to their testimonies, and referred to the confessions of captured U.S. military paratroopers and other relevant materials. After careful, repeated, and faithful verification, we conclude that the U.S. military authorities' crimes of torturing and massacring prisoners of war are indisputable.

We hereby publish to the world the facts of the U.S. military authorities' persecution and massacre of Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured.

**Chapter 1: Massacring Prisoners of War**

During the invasion of Korea, the U.S. military authorities subjected Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured and under their control, including those who had lost combat effectiveness on the battlefield, those who had not been evacuated from the war zone, wounded and sick personnel in field hospitals, and those detained in U.S. prisoner-of-war camps, to various forms of torture and massacre. These actions seriously violated the provisions of the Geneva Conventions of August 12, 1949, on the treatment of prisoners of war, Part I, Article 3, Part II, Article 13, and the Geneva Conventions of August 12, 1949, on the improvement of the condition of the wounded and sick in armed forces in the field, Chapter II, Article 15, and Chapter III, Article 19.

According to materials provided by the repatriated Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured, it has been confirmed that from November 1950 to July 1953, the U.S. military killed more than 2,600 Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured. The U.S. military authorities used bayonets, automatic rifles, carbines, light machine guns, heavy machine guns, 60mm mortars, hand grenades, poison gas, flamethrowers, armored vehicles, tanks, and other weapons, as well as brutal methods such as burning alive, shooting live targets, burying alive, disemboweling, strangling, and more. The repatriated Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured witnessed the U.S. military authorities and their subordinate units massacring prisoners of war, and some of them were survivors of these massacres, with scars still on their bodies.

**(1)**

The U.S. armed forces and the forces under the command of the U.S. military, including the Lee Syngman forces, brutally killed Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured and wounded or sick on the battlefield. According to confirmed materials, the number of Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured and killed reached more than 2,350, ranging from individual killings to mass massacres. The main incidents are as follows:

Many Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured were killed immediately upon capture. On May 21, 1951, in the area east of Hongcheon, 30 seriously wounded Chinese People's Volunteers, including Li Weiyi, were captured by the U.S. military and immediately shot to death (Appendix 1). On May 29, 1951, in the area north of Incheon, the U.S. military shot and killed more than 140 captured wounded Chinese People's Volunteers and Korean People's Army personnel, including more than 80 wounded Chinese People's Volunteers. On September 14, 1951, the Lee Syngman forces occupying the area south of Geumcheon, near Heukundul Ridge, massacred more than 50 seriously wounded Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured (Appendix 2). On May 30, 1951, in the Incheon area, the U.S. military massacred more than 20 wounded Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured. In May 1951, in the area near Yuncheon, southeast of Yeoncheon, the Lee Syngman forces massacred more than 70 wounded Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured. On November 7, 1951, when the Chinese People's Volunteers recaptured a position near Geumcheon, they discovered the bodies of soldiers who had been killed by the enemy on November 7. The deceased had their hands and feet bound and tied to trees, with wounds all over their bodies, indicating that they had been killed after being captured.

Many Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured were killed while being transferred from the combat area or during transit. On December 1, 1950, the U.S. 2nd Division's subordinate units, while retreating from Pyeongannam-do, Gaesung-gun, Jungseo-ri, used machine guns to shoot and kill 31 Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured. The deceased had "Prisoner of War" tags on their chests. On November 28, 1950, in the area of Gyeongseong, North Korea, the U.S. military, before withdrawing from the area, massacred more than 40 Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured. In late May 1951, more than 30 Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured and transferred to the vicinity of Daejeon were collectively killed. On May 28, 1951, the Lee Syngman forces stabbed to death a wounded Chinese People's Volunteer who was captured near Jigyeon Village. On May 30, on the road from Suwon to Daejeon, the U.S. military ran over and killed four Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured with a vehicle (Appendix 3).

The most brutal acts were committed by the U.S. armed forces and the Lee Syngman forces against unarmed personnel and wounded and sick personnel in Chinese People's Volunteer field hospitals and wounded and sick personnel transfer stations who fell into their hands. On May 27, 1951, on a mountain south of Yeoncheon, the U.S. military used machine guns to kill more than 130 wounded Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured in a field hospital (Appendix 4). In May, in the area of Hwacheon, the Lee Syngman forces shot and killed more than 100 wounded Chinese People's Volunteers (Appendix 5). On May 27, 1951, at 9 AM, more than 80 U.S. military personnel used machine guns and automatic rifles to massacre more than 220 wounded Chinese People's Volunteers in a field hospital in the Incheon area (Appendix 6). On May 27, 1951, near Hwacheon, the U.S. military shot and killed more than 20 wounded Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured and burned to death more than 10 wounded Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured in a field hospital.

Many Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured were killed by the U.S. military and the Lee Syngman forces for extracting military intelligence, looting property, and raping female prisoners of war.

On May 28, 1951, in Myeongwol-ri, northwest of Chuncheon, a major massacre occurred where more than 280 Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured were killed by the U.S. military and the Lee Syngman forces. After occupying the area, the U.S. military used machine guns and automatic rifles to shoot at wounded personnel lying on the ground and in air-raid shelters. Out of more than 280 wounded personnel, only Liu Chunrong (detention number 731125) survived (Appendix 7).

The brutal killings of wounded Chinese People's Volunteers and other personnel captured on the battlefield by the U.S. military and the Lee Syngman forces were also confirmed by U.S. military personnel and Lee Syngman military personnel who were captured by the Chinese People's Volunteers. U.S. 2nd Division, 2nd Battalion, HS Company soldier Otto Bell (serial number: RA-18276618) confirmed the incident on November 30, 1950, where the Lee Syngman forces collectively massacred more than 200 Chinese People's Volunteers and Korean People's Army personnel who were captured between Suncheon and Gunguk-ri. The report by U.S. 24th Division, 19th Infantry Regiment, 1st Company soldier Philip R. Anderson (serial number: RA-11179178) confirmed the incident where the U.S. military and the Lee Syngman forces buried prisoners of war alive (Appendix 8). Lee Syngman military soldier Choi Jeongjin, who was captured by the Chinese People's Volunteers, confirmed the incident on November 6, 1950, where the U.S. Marine Corps 1st Division's subordinate units massacred more than 100 Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured on the road near Haeseong-ri. Another captured Lee Syngman military soldier, Kim Jae-yong, said that he saw two Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured being used as "live targets" and shot to death on November 13, 1951.

**(2)**

Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured and detained in U.S. prisoner-of-war camps were also subjected to large-scale, unrestrained, and collective massacres by the U.S. military authorities and camp management, turning the camps into "death camps." According to confirmed materials, from June 1951 to July 1953, more than 240 Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured were killed by U.S. military gunfire, bayonets, hand grenades, poison gas, and other brutal methods in U.S.-controlled prisoner-of-war camps, and more than 300 prisoners of war were injured or maimed. There were three major incidents of collective massacres of prisoners of war.

The above figures are incomplete. The actual number of prisoners of war massacred by the U.S. military authorities far exceeds these figures.

The U.S. prisoner-of-war camp management personnel, camp guards, and U.S. military authorities' agents, including remnants of the Nationalist Chinese special forces sent to various prisoner-of-war camps, wantonly killed prisoners of war with impunity. In July 1951, in the Busan prisoner-of-war camp, a U.S. guard shot and killed Chinese People's Volunteer prisoner of war Wang Bingzhong without cause. On May 16, 1952, in the 602nd prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island, the U.S. military shot and killed Chinese People's Volunteer prisoner of war Wang Huayi. On July 8, 1952, U.S. guards shot and killed Chinese People's Volunteer prisoner of war Zhang Donghai (Appendix 9). In late August 1952, in the Busan prisoner-of-war camp, the Lee Syngman forces shot and killed Chinese People's Volunteer prisoner of war Li Wanqing. On October 27, 1952, in the 8th prisoner-of-war camp on Jeju Island, the U.S. military shot and killed Chinese People's Volunteer prisoner of war Hu Shusen. On December 14, 1952, the U.S. military shot and killed Chinese People's Volunteer prisoner of war Fan Jie (Appendix 10) and others.

From February to May 1952, the U.S. military authorities, in order to forcibly detain (so-called "voluntary repatriation") Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured, carried out large-scale, barbaric, and oppressive actions against prisoners of war in the camps, resulting in a series of massacres. Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured, including Zhao Chaozhou, Tan Jiu, Xu Gui, and Yuan Zongwen, were killed for refusing to forcibly have "anti-communist, anti-Russian" characters tattooed on their bodies. Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured, including Zhang Zhenlong, Tang Kaijian, Lin Xuepu, Qi Zhongtang, and Yang Wenhua, were killed during the U.S. military authorities' illegal "screening" for openly expressing their desire to return home.

From 1951 to 1952, the U.S. military authorities carried out three large-scale collective massacres of Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured in the camps. On the night of August 15, 1951, at 10 PM, the U.S. military authorities dispatched armed forces and tanks and armored vehicles, suddenly surrounding the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, and 7th prisoner-of-war detention centers in the 2nd Busan prisoner-of-war camp. They used machine guns and automatic rifles to fire densely at the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured in the camp, killing and injuring more than 60, with an initial investigation revealing that more than 20 were killed (Appendix 11). On the morning of May 21, 1952, at 7:30 AM, the U.S. military authorities dispatched armed forces and tanks and armored vehicles, surrounding the 3rd sick and wounded prisoner-of-war detention center in the 2nd Busan prisoner-of-war camp. A U.S. military major officer commanded the U.S. military to use machine guns, automatic rifles, poison gas, 60mm mortars, and other weapons to fire at the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured in the camp, and threw hand grenades at the prisoners' tents. According to incomplete statistics, the U.S. military killed and injured more than 190 sick and wounded Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured, including 35 who were killed, such as Yang Tinghua (Appendix 33).

On October 1, 1952, on Jeju Island, the "October 1st Massacre" occurred, shocking the world. The U.S. military authorities, with the 600-plus unarmed Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured in the "H" camp of the 8th prisoner-of-war camp as their target, carried out an unprecedentedly brutal collective massacre in the early morning of October 1st. The commander of the 8th prisoner-of-war camp, Colonel White, and officer Lieutenant Brooks directly commanded the operation. The U.S. military killed many prisoners of war in the camp and pursued them into the tents to massacre them. In this massacre, 65 Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured were killed, and nearly 100 were seriously injured and maimed. The camp was covered in the blood of the dead and injured (Appendix 12).

In the incidents of massacring Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured, the U.S. military authorities not only used modern killing weapons but also used brutal methods such as burying alive, waterboarding, disemboweling, burning, nailing, branding, stabbing with knives, and beating with sticks. Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured, including Cao Lixing and Zhang Zhenlong, were killed with knives. Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured, including Wang Kang, Yang Jiefu, and Zuo Wenjiang, were strangled with ropes. Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured, including Wang Shaoqi and Yu Shiji, were beaten to death with clubs. Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured, including Zheng Donghai, were killed by having water poured into their mouths or rectums and being branded on their stomachs. Chinese People's Volunteer prisoner of war Xu Gui was nailed to death. Chinese People's Volunteer prisoner of war Ren Daomu was burned to death with gasoline. On the night of April 8, 1952, the U.S. military authorities sent agents, including Li Da'an, to the prisoner-of-war camp, who killed Chinese People's Volunteer prisoner of war Lin Xuepu and brutally removed his heart. Li Da'an, holding the bloody heart, threatened and intimidated the prisoners (Appendix 26, 31).

The U.S. military authorities' barbaric actions against Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured in the camps were also confirmed by reports from U.S. and British news agencies and by U.S. prisoner-of-war camp officers. According to incomplete figures disclosed by U.S. and British news agencies, from July 1951 to July 1953, a total of 3,438 Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured were killed and injured in U.S. prisoner-of-war camps, including 624 who were killed. This figure is obviously greatly reduced.

In the "Dud Event" that occurred on Geoje Island in May 1952, in the reply letter signed by then U.S. prisoner-of-war camp commander Brigadier General Colson and supplemented by then U.S. prisoner-of-war camp commander Brigadier General Dodd to the Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers prisoner-of-war delegation, it was admitted that the U.S. military authorities had brutally massacred Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured (Appendix 13).

The above evidence proves that the U.S. military authorities, in violation of the Geneva Conventions and principles of international law, brutally killed a large number of Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured. These large-scale massacres of prisoners of war were carried out systematically under the planning and support of high-level U.S. military agencies and senior U.S. military leaders. This refers to the U.S. Far East Command, former U.S. Far East Commander and UN Commander General Ridgway, former U.S. Far East Commander and UN Commander General Clark, and former 8th Army Commander General Van Fleet.

**Chapter 2: Illegal Interrogations**

The U.S. military authorities seriously violated the provisions of Article 17 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions on the treatment of prisoners of war, which states: "No physical or mental torture or any other form of coercion shall be inflicted on prisoners of war to obtain any information from them. Prisoners of war who refuse to answer shall not be threatened, insulted, or subjected to any unpleasant or unfavorable treatment." They also violated the provisions of Article 87, and illegally conducted interrogations to extract various types of information from Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured, using brutal torture methods such as hanging, pressing with bars, stabbing with knives, cutting flesh, inserting needles under fingernails, electrocution, pouring chili water, and confinement in water dungeons and thorn cages (Appendix 14), even resulting in death.

The U.S. military authorities' public interrogation agencies for prisoners of war include the "U.S. Far East Command Intelligence Section" (G-2), "War Criminal Investigation Section," "Counterintelligence Corps," "War Criminal Investigation Department," and the "Provost Marshal's Office" established in prisoner-of-war concentration areas. The U.S. military not only conducted illegal interrogations of prisoners of war in the above agencies but also on the front lines, during prisoner-of-war transfers, in prisoner-of-war camps, and in prisoner-of-war hospitals. U.S. military officers, military police, military doctors, Nationalist Chinese special forces remnants, and Lee Syngman special forces conducted illegal interrogations of prisoners of war at any time and place, regardless of whether they were seriously wounded.

All 511 Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured and repatriated from the "F" camp of the 8th prisoner-of-war camp on Jeju Island had been subjected to illegal interrogations, with 442 having experienced various forms of torture, accounting for more than 86% of the total number. The types, numbers, and frequencies of torture are as follows:

**Types of Torture**	**Number of Victims**	**Total Number of Torture Incidents**
Electrocution	16	40
Hanging	12	18
Burning	3	3
Pouring chili water	1	1
Pressing with bars	1	1
Cutting flesh	4	4
Stabbing with bayonets	6	6
Beating with whips or clubs	198	337
Freezing	2	2
Beating wounds	3	3
Beating and other forms	216	283

On the front lines, the U.S. military conducted torture interrogations of Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured. For example, after Hao Yongcheng was captured near Longtou-ri in the central region on March 15, 1951, the U.S. military, during the interrogation, tied his hands behind his back, covered his eyes with a cloth, and dragged him into a rice field, keeping him submerged for three and a half days. His lower body was covered in blisters and swollen. Yu Feng'an, after being captured near Baekseok Mountain in the central region, was subjected to continuous interrogation and hanging for five days and nights by the U.S. military. Even more brutally, the U.S. military, regardless of the wounds, subjected captured Chinese People's Volunteers to torture during interrogations. For example, Yang Yundian, who had a head wound, was captured on the south bank of the Han River on May 24, 1951. A U.S. lieutenant, during the interrogation, struck his head with a rifle butt and applied electric torture twice, causing Yang Yundian's wound to bleed excessively and rendering him unconscious for several days.

During the transfer of prisoners of war, the U.S. military also conducted torture interrogations, even interrogating once at each stop. For example, after Liu Guang was wounded and captured near Cheorwon on April 22, 1951, he was subjected to five illegal interrogations during the transfer. During the interrogations, U.S. military officers, including a major and a lieutenant colonel, applied torture methods such as burning his fingers, beating him with iron rods, strangling him with ropes, and electrocution (Appendix 15). For example, after Zheng Xianmin was wounded and captured near Dapyeong-ri on February 18, 1951, he was transferred through four dressing stations on the same day. Because he refused to be interrogated, the U.S. military not only did not dress his wounds but also forcibly twisted his already fractured left leg. Zhang Lianzhi was also subjected to similar torture during the transfer.

In the prisoner-of-war camps, the U.S. military conducted even more frenzied and around-the-clock illegal interrogations of prisoners of war. Prisoner of war Zhou Liangsheng, in February 1951, was taken to the dark and damp basement of the "War Criminal Investigation Section" in Busan by the U.S. military, where he was imprisoned for 42 days, subjected to electric torture seven times, and frozen for eight hours (Appendix 16). Zhao Zhikui, in the 1st sick and wounded prisoner-of-war detention center in the 2nd Busan prisoner-of-war camp on September 29, 1951, was interrogated by a U.S. military captain about military intelligence, subjected to beating with clubs, electrocution, and pouring chili water, and denied treatment for eight days, causing his wounds to become infected and ulcerated (Appendix 17). Prisoner of war Bai Yushan from the 72nd Regiment on Geoje Island, during an interrogation in October 1951, was tied up by six special agents and beaten with iron rods on his joints, stabbed with a knife on his calves, and burned with fire on his skin. Bai Yushan's entire body was swollen and covered in wounds.

The U.S. military's brutal illegal interrogations were also conducted in prisoner-of-war hospitals. Prisoner of war Zhang Bingrong, in June 1952, in the prisoner-of-war hospital on Geoje Island, was subjected to illegal interrogation by the U.S. military. Three U.S. military personnel poured dirty water into his mouth. The hospital authorities, in order to extract various types of information, lit a four-foot-high stove in the ward in the hot month of June, closed the doors and windows tightly, causing the sick and wounded prisoners of war to sweat profusely and suffer greatly.

During the interrogations, in addition to extracting various types of information, the U.S. military authorities even used torture to force prisoners of war to confess to being "war criminals" and imprisoned them. Prisoner of war Tian Tianming, on July 6, 1951, on Geoje Island, was interrogated by a U.S. military lieutenant. The lieutenant used two seven-inch-long iron nails to nail into his right thigh, forcing him to confess to killing a U.S. military prisoner of war. After that, he was imprisoned as a "war criminal." Prisoner of war Jin Xingguo from the 72nd Regiment on Geoje Island, on November 29, 1951, was taken to the "War Criminal Investigation Section" by the U.S. military and forced to confess to killing 17 U.S. military prisoners of war. Jin Xingguo refuted, saying, "The Chinese People's Volunteers treat prisoners of war humanely and have never killed any prisoners of war." He was immediately subjected to torture such as pouring cold water and electrocution. Finally, the U.S. military shamelessly forced him to sign a statement admitting to killing one U.S. military prisoner of war and pressed his fingerprint on it, imprisoning him as a "war criminal" (Appendix 18). Prisoner of war Meng Qingzhang (Appendix 19) and others were also falsely accused of being "war criminals" and imprisoned by the U.S. military.

The U.S. military authorities' torture interrogations of prisoners of war resulted in many prisoners of war becoming disabled. For example, prisoner of war Li Bolin, in late 1951, in the 61st prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island, had his spine broken by a U.S. military captain and special agents during an interrogation. During the torture interrogations, the U.S. military often killed prisoners of war. Prisoner of war Liu Fengjiang, on November 20, 1951, in Chuncheon, witnessed a U.S. military captain applying electric torture to Gao Zhenmei and Zhang Guizhi (female) during an interrogation and then beating them to death with a club.

**Chapter 3: Living Conditions Abuse**

The U.S. military authorities completely violated the provisions of the 1949 Geneva Conventions on the treatment of prisoners of war, Part III, Section II, Chapter II, regarding the accommodation, food, clothing, and hygiene facilities of prisoners of war (including sick and wounded prisoners of war), causing prisoners of war to suffer from prolonged hunger, health deterioration, and the spread of diseases in the camps, resulting in prisoners of war becoming emaciated and losing a significant amount of weight. The following are the facts of the U.S. military's mistreatment of prisoners of war in terms of food, clothing, and accommodation.

**Food**

The food supplied to prisoners of war by the U.S. military camp management authorities was mostly moldy, some with husks not removed, and mixed with sand. The main food for prisoners of war was barley and a small amount of peas and broken rice, or wheat and already moldy barley flour. All prisoners of war (including sick and wounded personnel) could only eat half a bowl of rice per meal. When eating moldy barley flour, each person could only get a lump of dough about the size of an egg, weighing about four to five liang (approximately 200-250 grams). Therefore, prisoners of war were constantly in a state of hunger.

The side dishes were also of poor quality, lacking nutrition and hygiene. The cabbage was rotten; the radishes were old and hollow; the dried fish slices were infested with worms; and there were many small worms in the vegetables. Even so, each person's half small bowl of "soup" contained only two or three pieces of cabbage leaves and radish slices. Before the first half of 1952, sometimes each person could get about four ounces (approximately 113 grams) of meat per day (each person could only get about 1.25 grams of canned meat). After the second half of 1952, meat was no longer seen. The dried fish slices issued to the prisoners of war in the 8th prisoner-of-war camp on Jeju Island averaged only about 30 to 60 grams per person per day.

Prisoners of war not only suffered from prolonged hunger but also lacked sufficient water to drink. In the 602nd prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island, more than 5,000 Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured were detained, but there was only one water tap with a diameter of 2 centimeters, and water was only released for two hours a day. After 8 AM, the U.S. military closed the water pipe. In the summer of 1951, the 72nd Regiment on Geoje Island, with more than 7,000 people, had only one water pipe, which was also regulated to release water for only two hours a day.

Due to the scarcity of water and the large number of people, cooking became very difficult. The limited water supply often resulted in half-cooked or raw rice; vegetables could not be washed and were thrown into the pot with dirt. As for drinking water, it was even more difficult. In the 72nd and 86th Regiments on Geoje Island, a water bucket was placed under the water tap, and prisoners of war had to line up to get water, with each person only able to get a small bowl of water per day. The prisoners of war were extremely thirsty and had to drink dirty water from the sewer or, during forced labor, drink a mouthful of seawater despite the U.S. military's beatings.

The U.S. military camp management authorities also arbitrarily cut off the food and water supply to prisoners of war. The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd sick and wounded prisoner-of-war detention centers in Busan were subjected to an unreasonable cutoff of food and water for seven to twelve days starting from May 11, 1952. On October 4, 1952, the "D" camp in the 8th prisoner-of-war camp on Jeju Island was also subjected to an unreasonable cutoff of food for three days (see the chapter on illegal punishments of prisoners of war for details).

In order to survive, prisoners of war were forced to dig pits for water in the camps, but they were brutally prohibited by the U.S. military camp management authorities. For example, the U.S. military camp management authorities on Geoje Island ordered the prisoners of war in the 72nd Regiment to fill in all the pits. On July 8, 1952, when the "G" camp in the 8th prisoner-of-war camp on Jeju Island was unreasonably cut off from water, prisoners of war, desperate for water, dug wells. The U.S. military opened fire, killing prisoner of war Zhang Donghai and injuring Mao Youcai.

**Clothing**

The clothing and personal belongings of each prisoner of war were looted by the U.S. military and the Lee Syngman forces upon capture.

In July 1951, the U.S. military camp management authorities on Geoje Island issued red and yellow short-sleeved shirts and shorts to prisoners of war, with each person only getting one set. There was no way to change or wash them. Moreover, many people wore such thin clothing in the winter. The prisoners of war shivered with cold, and many had their hands and feet frozen, swollen, cracked, and oozing yellow liquid. In the winter of 1951, in the 86th Regiment, 6th Battalion, 16th Company of the 8th prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island, 34 out of 60-plus prisoners of war were frostbitten, with seven severely affected. In the winter of 1952, out of the more than 6,000 prisoners of war in the 8th prisoner-of-war camp on Jeju Island, 2,700 had their hands and feet frozen and ulcerated. In the "A" camp, with more than 500 prisoners of war, three-quarters were frostbitten. Prisoners of war Bai Jintang, Ni Wanfu, and more than 20 others had their feet frozen and rotted, exposing the bones. The U.S. military, instead of providing proper medical treatment, ordered them to continue with forced labor.

During forced labor, prisoners of war picked up scraps of paper, straw, and rotten sacks to wrap around their waists and feet for warmth. However, the U.S. military and the remnants of the Nationalist Chinese special forces in various prisoner-of-war camps considered this an "insult to the dignity of the United Nations" and imposed various cruel punishments on the prisoners of war.

The sick and wounded prisoners of war detained in the 2nd Busan prisoner-of-war camp did not get clothes to wear for a long time. For example, prisoner of war Ding Zhenfang, in the 1st sick and wounded prisoner-of-war detention center, did not wear clothes from August 1951 to August 1952, only wrapping himself in a torn blanket. Sha Rongzhang, in the winter of 1951, in the 2nd sick and wounded prisoner-of-war detention center, had no clothes or socks, resulting in severe frostbite, making it difficult to move. The U.S. military, however, accused him of walking slowly and stabbed him several times with a bayonet on his buttocks.

The prisoners of war's torn clothes had no needles and thread to mend, making them even more tattered.

The shoes issued to prisoners of war by the U.S. military camp management authorities were all worn-out leather shoes discarded by U.S. soldiers, and the quantity issued was very limited, with many prisoners of war having no shoes to wear.

The U.S. military camp management authorities never issued socks to prisoners of war.

**Accommodation**

Prisoners of war lived in tents or iron sheds. A tent was about 10 meters long and 5 meters wide (with an approximately 1-meter-wide path in the middle, on both sides of which people slept in rows), generally accommodating 50 to 80 people, with each person occupying a width of 15 to 20 centimeters (in the 2nd and 3rd sick and wounded prisoner-of-war detention centers in Busan, it was about 30 centimeters). Prisoners of war could only sleep on their sides, and if they turned over, they would be squeezed and unable to move. In October 1951, a tent in the 11th detention center in Busan once accommodated 200 people, with many people forced to sleep outside the tent.

After October 1951, various prisoner-of-war camps gradually converted tents into iron sheds, which were about 45 meters long and 5.5 meters wide, accommodating more than 300 people. Although the area seemed to provide better living conditions, the actual situation was even more crowded. A few special agents occupied half of the iron shed, leaving the rest for the general prisoners of war. Therefore, each person only had a width of 12 to 15 centimeters. After a day of heavy labor, some prisoners of war could only hug their knees and doze off, unable to sleep.

In winter, the iron sheds were very cold. In the 72nd Regiment, there was only one stove in an iron shed, but the amount of coal supplied each day was very limited. Before the iron shed could get warm, the coal would run out. Each prisoner of war was only issued two (one in summer) torn blankets resembling sackcloth. In winter nights, prisoners of war often froze and could not sleep.

The tents and iron sheds in various prisoner-of-war camps on Geoje Island were built on slightly leveled rice fields. Prisoners of war slept on the ground, with thin straw mats. Because it was too damp, mold grew under the mats, causing many prisoners of war to fall ill. Out of the more than 6,000 prisoners of war transferred from Geoje Island to Jeju Island, 2,500 had scabies, and 730 had arthritis.

The tents were all old and leaky, and prisoners of war had to huddle together in the rain. If a storm blew, the tents would collapse, and prisoners of war would have to stand in the heavy rain with no place to hide.

Due to the crowded living conditions, damp ground, and frequent inability to bathe or wash clothes, and the special agents' restrictions on prisoners' free movement, the doors and windows of the tents and iron sheds were often not allowed to be opened, making the air inside very foul.

The iron sheds and tents were dimly lit, with no lights at night.

**Hygiene Facilities**

According to the provisions of Article 29 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions on the treatment of prisoners of war, "The detaining power shall be responsible for taking the necessary measures to ensure the cleanliness and hygiene of the camps and to prevent the spread of infectious diseases." However, the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps lacked even the most basic hygiene facilities, making it difficult for prisoners of war to wash their faces, let alone take baths or wash clothes.

According to materials provided by repatriated Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured, due to the lack of water in the camps, washing faces was a difficult task. Prisoners of war could only wash their faces once a week, sometimes once a month, and had to share a basin with dozens of people.

The U.S. military camp management authorities issued only one toothbrush for every dozen people or only tooth powder without a toothbrush. Therefore, prisoners of war could not brush their teeth for years. The razor blades used by prisoners of war for shaving were issued every two to four months, with 15 to 50 people sharing one blade. However, a blade became dull after shaving three times. In this situation, prisoners of war' hair grew very long.

In the 72nd and 86th Regiments on Geoje Island, there was only one toilet with ten buckets for every 1,200 to 1,300 people, making it very difficult for prisoners of war to relieve themselves. Moreover, due to poor diet, drinking raw and dirty water, about 30% to 80% of prisoners of war suffered from diarrhea, and the lack of toilets made it even more difficult for them to relieve themselves.

Although various prisoner-of-war camps had established so-called "bathrooms," due to the lack of water, no one had taken a bath, and the "bathrooms" were usually used as torture chambers for hanging prisoners of war.

Due to the prolonged inability to bathe, lack of clothes to change, and the infestation of lice and body lice on clothes, blankets, and hair, prisoners of war suffered from various diseases, severely damaging their health.

According to materials provided by Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured and worked in medical services in the camps, including Wang Zeying (detention number 730445), Zuo Lianshen (710345), Li Bingyun (706101), and Zhang Jingrong (716234), in the camps, dysentery was very common. In July and August 1952, out of the 550 prisoners of war in the "A" camp of the 8th prisoner-of-war camp on Jeju Island, more than 400 had dysentery.

Night blindness and dry conjunctivitis were also common. For example, in July 1951, due to severe malnutrition, 40% to 50% of the prisoners of war in the 86th Regiment suffered from dry conjunctivitis. Out of the more than 6,000 prisoners of war in the 8th prisoner-of-war camp, 3,740 had night blindness. In the 11th Company of the "A" camp, 43 out of 68 prisoners of war had reduced vision due to eye diseases. For example, prisoner of war Song Guoying could not move at night.

In March 1952, a U.S. military doctor personally selected prisoners of war from the 72nd Regiment to be sent to the 70th prisoner-of-war camp for forced labor. At that time, out of more than 7,000 people, only about 1,500 were selected, and the rest were all weak, disabled, severely ill, or had night blindness.

The camps lacked mosquito prevention facilities, making malaria very common. In the summer of 1952, more than 3,300 prisoners of war in the 8th prisoner-of-war camp on Jeju Island had malaria.

Other diseases such as anemia, stomach diseases, scabies, and arthritis were also very common in various prisoner-of-war camps. In addition, many prisoners of war suffered from lung diseases and bronchitis.

Prisoners of war, under extreme harsh living conditions, lost a significant amount of weight. For example, Wang Tongxin (formerly detained in the "A" camp of the 8th prisoner-of-war camp on Jeju Island) weighed 68 kilograms before being captured and 48 kilograms upon repatriation, losing about 30%. The above facts strongly prove the U.S. military camp management authorities' crimes of mistreating prisoners of war in terms of living conditions.

**Chapter 4: Psychological Torture**

According to the provisions of Articles 14 of Part II, 34 and 38 of Part III, Section II, and 71 of Part V, Section VII of the 1949 Geneva Conventions on the treatment of prisoners of war, prisoners of war should be treated humanely in their spiritual lives. However, the U.S. military authorities, in order to detain prisoners of war, subjected them to psychological persecution, forcing Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured to undergo reactionary political education. They openly sent special agents to use religion as a cover, using preaching as a pretext to threaten, deceive, and propagandize to prisoners of war. In addition, they used various means to restrict prisoners of war' freedom in their spiritual lives.

**1. Forced Reactionary Political Education**

The U.S. military camp management authorities, in order to change the political beliefs of prisoners of war, openly sent Captain Booth (Capt. Booth), and remnants of the Nationalist Chinese special forces, including Zhang Xingdeng, Zhang Qide, Zhang Bo, Gan Biying, and Wang Jizhong, to establish so-called "anti-communist" schools in the 72nd and 86th Regiments on Geoje Island from August to October 1951. They forced prisoners of war to undergo reactionary political education and obstructed prisoners of war from returning home (Appendix 20). Special agents such as Li Qi, Liu Bingzhang, Liu Chenghan, Wang Jiti, and Cheng Liren successively served as principals, deans, and teachers. There were four classes per day, each lasting two hours, with various battalions of prisoners of war taking turns attending. Prisoners of war were extremely disgusted with this reactionary education and refused to accept it. The special agents in the camps used clubs to forcibly drag prisoners of war into the classrooms. Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured were extremely indignant about the special agents' insults to their homeland. If they dared to refute, they would be subjected to torture, forced to lie down, forced to kneel, or even subjected to cruel torture. For example, prisoner of war Yang Tingyu, from the 86th Regiment, refused to listen in class and was dragged out and beaten on the joints of his limbs with a club, and then forced to lie down. Prisoner of war Yuan Yushan, during a discussion, refused to speak, and the special agents hung and beat him, then forced him to kneel in the snow all night and locked him up for a day. Prisoner of war Liu Youcai, under the test question "Communism is totalitarianism," drew a "1" (indicating negation), and the special agents dragged him out and beat him severely, stripped him naked, poured water into his anus, and then stomped on his swollen stomach with their feet, causing him to bleed from his nose and mouth.

In addition to openly forcing prisoners of war to undergo the above reactionary education, the remnants of the Nationalist Chinese special forces also secretly instructed special agents in the camps to force prisoners of war to "sign blood letters," "tattoo characters," and obstruct prisoners of war from returning home.

**2. Using Religion as a Cover for Special Activities**

In order to achieve their unspoken goals, the U.S. military authorities openly sent Woodberry (Wu Bogui), Han Binghe, and a self-proclaimed "Father Su" special agent to use religion as a cover and conduct special activities in the 72nd and 86th Regiments on Geoje Island. They used "worship" and "prayer" as pretexts to threaten prisoners of war.

Prisoners of war were extremely indignant about their despicable special activities disguised as preaching and refused to listen to their so-called preaching. Therefore, U.S. military police and special agents used clubs to drive prisoners of war to attend, and those who refused would be beaten and punished. After being driven to attend, if prisoners of war did not bow their heads, did not listen attentively, or did not recite their reactionary political propaganda, they would also be subjected to severe beatings. For example, more than 20 prisoners of war from the 86th Regiment, including Li Zhong, were beaten 40 times with a club each because they did not follow along in recitation.

The special agents sent by the U.S. military, in addition to the above threats and deception disguised as preaching, also directly and indirectly harmed prisoners of war. In 1951, when the special agents in the 72nd Regiment on Geoje Island began to force prisoners of war to tattoo characters, Woodberry instructed the secretary of the "63" branch of the Nationalist Party, Wei Shixi, to force the 4th Battalion (officer battalion) prisoners of war to tattoo characters. After tattooing, Woodberry also took photos. In October 1951, Woodberry and Han Binghe provided knives, shovels, picks, and clubs to the special agents in the 86th Regiment on Geoje Island to beat prisoners of war. Woodberry also personally interrogated prisoner of war Li Wuyang in a tent, forcing him to admit to being a member of the Chinese Communist Party and a Chinese People's Volunteer officer. Li Wuyang firmly refused to admit, and Woodberry slapped him several times and ordered the special agents to drag him away and beat him severely. In early April 1952, before the U.S. military conducted "screening" of prisoners of war, Woodberry and Han Binghe had repeatedly transported knives with "U.S." markings to the 72nd Regiment to provide special agents with weapons for threatening and killing prisoners of war (Appendix 29). For example, on July 18, 1952, a self-proclaimed "Father Su" special agent and U.S. military officers, including Major Osman and Lieutenant Diddle, led a platoon of U.S. military personnel to storm into the "H" camp of the 8th prisoner-of-war camp on Jeju Island, spraying corrosive and ulcerating liquid on prisoners of war, injuring 165 prisoners of war.

**3. Depriving Prisoners of War of the Right to Learn Culture and Entertainment**

The U.S. military camp management authorities completely obstructed and destroyed prisoners of war' voluntary learning and entertainment, using various means.

Prisoners of war in the 8th prisoner-of-war camp on Jeju Island and the 2nd Busan prisoner-of-war camp, under extremely scarce learning supplies (all personal items of prisoners of war, including pens and notebooks, were confiscated upon capture), made pens from scrap iron and used pot soot as ink, and collected scraps of paper to learn culture. The U.S. military camp management authorities, under the pretext of inspecting hygiene, conducted armed searches and confiscated and destroyed all learning supplies of prisoners of war.

As for prisoners of war' legitimate entertainment, such as singing their favorite songs, it was also prohibited by the U.S. military camp management authorities, and they even imposed punishments such as cutting off food and water, resulting in massacres. On July 18, 1952, prisoners of war in the "H" camp of the 8th prisoner-of-war camp were injured by the U.S. military throwing poison gas grenades and spraying corrosive and ulcerating liquid because they sang songs. On August 15 of the same year, the "F" camp also suffered the same harm. In addition, incidents of prisoners of war being beaten or stabbed by the U.S. military for singing patriotic songs during forced labor were common.

**4. Insulting Prisoners of War' Dignity**

According to the provisions of Article 14 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions on the treatment of prisoners of war, "Prisoners of war shall in all circumstances be treated with humanity and respect for their honor." However, the U.S. military used various despicable means to insult prisoners of war' dignity. On the morning of September 27, 1952, Colonel Due (Col. Due) of the U.S. military arranged for about a company of armed U.S. military personnel and more than 40 light and heavy machine guns at the Jeju Island airport, ordering all prisoners of war in the "H" camp of the 8th prisoner-of-war camp to strip naked and salute him. The captured personnel could not bear this insult and refused to salute, immediately being beaten by the U.S. military with fists and feet or stabbed with bayonets, with more than 20 people, including Tang Genpei and Zhao Yi, being injured. In February 1953, when prisoners of war from the 8th prisoner-of-war camp were taken out for forced labor, the U.S. military deliberately threw chewing gum wrappers on the ground and forced a prisoner of war surnamed Song to pick them up. The prisoner of war refused, and the U.S. military shot and killed him.

Communication is a right that prisoners of war should have. According to the provisions of Article 71 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions on the treatment of prisoners of war, "Prisoners of war shall be allowed to send and receive letters and postcards," and "such letters and postcards shall be forwarded by the detaining power with the utmost speed, and shall not be withheld or delayed on disciplinary grounds." However, the U.S. military camp management authorities completely deprived prisoners of war of this right. In January and during the Spring Festival of 1953, after repeated requests from prisoners of war in the 8th prisoner-of-war camp, the U.S. military camp management authorities first agreed to grant prisoners of war the right to communicate but at the same time imposed many restrictions. When prisoners of war had written thousands of letters to be sent back to their homeland, the U.S. military camp management authorities, under the pretext of exposing the true living conditions of prisoners of war, detained these letters (Appendix 21).

On June 2, 1952, the commander of the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp, Boatner, in a memorandum to the Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured, stated: "Your national flag may be hoisted on your national day..." However, when prisoners of war hoisted the flag to celebrate their national day on October 1, 1952, the U.S. military went back on their word, massacring prisoners of war and causing a major incident with 165 dead and injured prisoners of war.

**Chapter 5: Forced Labor**

The U.S. military authorities blatantly violated the 1949 Geneva Conventions on the treatment of prisoners of war, forcibly detaining Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured (including sick and wounded personnel) in prisoner-of-war camps in Busan, Geoje Island, and Jeju Island, and forcing them to engage in heavy, unpaid labor in U.S. military barracks, docks, and other places, day and night, year-round. This included labor of a military nature, which is explicitly prohibited by the Geneva Conventions. The labor that prisoners of war engaged in was carried out under conditions of insufficient food, physical exhaustion, and the U.S. military camp management authorities' disregard for local climate conditions. The U.S. military arbitrarily insulted, beat, and punished prisoners of war who were engaged in labor. Prisoners of war, due to the lack of tools and protective equipment, suffered from serious diseases and disabilities, even leading to death.

The living conditions of prisoners of war who were forced to engage in heavy labor were extremely harsh. They could only eat three half-bowls of porridge made from mixed grains per day, leaving them hungry and weak. They were driven to labor sites from dawn till dusk, day and night, engaging in heavy labor. In summer, prisoners of war wore short-sleeved shirts and shorts, exposing their limbs to the scorching sun, causing their skin to peel, swell, and ache, even leading to fainting. In winter, prisoners of war wore thin clothes that could not keep them warm and were forced to labor in the cold wind and snow. Many prisoners of war had their hands, feet, and faces frostbitten.

**Chapter 6: Illegal Punishments**

The U.S. military authorities, in violation of the 1949 Geneva Conventions on the treatment of prisoners of war, arbitrarily imposed various cruel punishments on Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured, including beating, hanging, electric shock, and other forms of torture, causing many prisoners of war to suffer from severe injuries and disabilities, and even leading to death.

The U.S. military authorities, in order to detain prisoners of war, arbitrarily imposed various cruel punishments on prisoners of war in the camps, causing many prisoners of war to suffer from severe injuries and disabilities, and even leading to death.

**Chapter 7: Forced Detention**

The U.S. military authorities, in violation of the 1949 Geneva Conventions on the treatment of prisoners of war, arbitrarily detained Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured, refusing to repatriate them according to the agreements and violating the principles of international law.

**Chapter 8: Forced Espionage**

The U.S. military authorities, in violation of the 1949 Geneva Conventions on the treatment of prisoners of war, forcibly recruited Chinese People's Volunteers who were captured to engage in espionage activities, threatening and coercing them to provide military intelligence and other information, and even forcing them to engage in sabotage and assassination activities.

Title: U.S. Military Violates Geneva Conventions in Treatment of Chinese POWs

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 3rd.

The U.S. military authorities in charge of POW camps have violated Article 53 of the 1949 Geneva Convention by forcing many POWs to work endlessly. For example, at the 70th Regiment on Geojedo Island, there are over 1,500 captured Chinese People's Volunteers. The U.S. military camp authorities demand 900 to 1,000 people during the day and 500 to 600 people at night to work, but excluding the kitchen staff of about 200 people, only 1,300 people actually work. Therefore, 100 to 200 people must work continuously day and night. Particularly severe is the period from late March to early April 1952, when the U.S. military camp authorities demanded 1,200 people during the day and 700 people at night for about 20 days. This means that each time, 600 people had to work continuously for 24 hours. For example, POW Jin Guian had to endure this kind of excessive labor four times during this period.

According to Article 49 of the 1949 Geneva Convention, "The detaining power may utilize the labor of prisoners of war who are physically fit, subject to their age, sex, rank, and physical condition, and especially with the aim of maintaining the health and physical condition of the prisoners of war." However, the U.S. military camp authorities use force to compel POWs who are unfit by age and physical condition, as well as officers and wounded POWs, to perform various heavy labor tasks. Many of them often suffer from coughing up blood or worsening of their conditions, leading to death. For instance, POW Dai Jinsheng, who was only 18 years old, was forced by the U.S. military in June 1952 to carry a stone weighing about 200 pounds with another POW. He only carried it for one day before coughing up blood. POW Chen Qihou from the 86th Regiment on Geojedo Island was beaten with a stick all over his body while working in September 1951, causing him to cough up blood. His condition worsened, and he coughed up blood every two to three months, each time for more than ten days, resulting in severe lung disease. Wounded POW Sun Zhiquan and others had their bodies severely damaged while performing heavy labor (Attachment 22). According to the already repatriated Chinese People's Volunteer POW Tian Zhicheng, he personally witnessed three POWs with lung disease, Dong Yuzhong and others, being forced by the U.S. military to work on barbed wire for four consecutive days from May 23 to 26, 1952. As a result, all three had their conditions worsen, and Dong Yuzhong died.

The types of labor that the U.S. military forces POWs to perform are numerous, including torturous tasks such as moving and breaking stones. Particularly severe is the fact that the U.S. military, in violation of Article 50 of the Geneva Convention, uses violence to force POWs to perform military-related labor, such as loading and unloading camouflaged boxes containing poison gas shells, hand grenade casings, artillery shells, bullets, carbines, light and heavy machine guns, etc.; digging trenches; building air-raid shelters, ammunition depots, military fuel tanks, and other military facilities.

During labor, the U.S. military arbitrarily beats POWs with whips, stabs them with bayonets, and imposes humiliating and collective punishments. The types of punishments are numerous, such as forcing POWs to carry heavy objects while running, running barefoot on a stony ground, and even extending working hours and cutting off food and water. For example, on February 27, 1953, POW Li Fengming and ten others from the "E" camp of the 8th POW camp on Jeju Island were forced by the U.S. military to move oil drums. A U.S. soldier arbitrarily punished Li Fengming to lie down, but Li Fengming refused. The U.S. soldier then beat Li Fengming's two front teeth with a stone, causing his mouth to bleed profusely. All the POWs protested against this unreasonable violence, but the U.S. military retaliated by cutting off their food and water for two meals. In July 1951, POW Zhang Zhiqing and 60 others from the 4th Battalion of the 86th Regiment on Geojedo Island were forced by the U.S. military to break stones. The U.S. military, under the pretext of working too slowly, forced Zhang Zhiqing and 60 others to strip naked and lie down, exposing them to the scorching sun. Immediately, some, like Tian Shuangen, fainted. On September 13, 1952, POWs Han Yueji and 225 others from the "D" camp of the 8th POW camp on Jeju Island were forced by the U.S. military to dig trenches. When they protested against the deprivation of their rest rights, the U.S. military, with four tanks and two rows of armed soldiers, escorted them to a narrow, damp hangar and detained them, cutting off their food and water for 32 hours. In the hot, tired, and hungry conditions, POWs like Zhang Dejun and Liu Jianfu immediately fainted. At night, the U.S. military, without reason, opened fire, injuring Puhu Lin and Guo Yunqing.

The U.S. military camp authorities drive POWs to work without tools and protective equipment, and the work is extremely dangerous, resulting in frequent injuries and deaths among POWs. For example, when breaking stones, POWs often get their hands and feet injured due to the lack of tools. POW Wang Yongchao from the "H" camp of the 8th POW camp on Jeju Island was injured in his left leg by a crane's large hook while loading and unloading large wooden boxes on the pier in September 1952. POWs Liu Yonghe and two others from the "J" camp of the same camp were also injured by the crane's large hook while unloading cargo (Attachment 23). According to the already repatriated Chinese People's Volunteer POWs Chen Wenyi, Yang Zhiyuan, and Li Zhong, in September 1951, POW Tan Xinwu and 30 others from the 5th Battalion of the 86th Regiment on Geojedo Island were forced to dig soil under a steep slope with loose soil that was about to collapse. The slope suddenly collapsed, burying Tan Xinwu and three others to death.

Chapter 6: Illegal Punishment of POWs

The U.S. military camp authorities frequently and brutally punish POWs without reason. Every action of the POWs is used as an excuse for "punishment," and even the wounded and officers cannot escape.

The U.S. military's methods of illegally punishing POWs are numerous, including cutting off food and water, stopping medical treatment, beating, making them lie down, putting them in water cells, earth cells, imprisoning them in cells without sunlight, and endless labor. The behavior of the U.S. military authorities in openly violating the 1949 Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War is absolutely unacceptable. The Chinese People's Volunteer POWs who have suffered cruel torture have exposed in their accusations the various crimes of the U.S. military camp authorities and the remnants of the Kuomintang special agents in Taiwan.

Illegal Punishment of Individuals

According to Article 13 of the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War, "Prisoners of war must at all times be treated humanely. Any act of violence or intimidation, as well as insults and public curiosity, must be prohibited. Acts of reprisal against prisoners of war are prohibited." However, POWs detained in the 72nd and 86th Regiments on Geojedo Island are often subjected to various punishments. Moreover, they are punished multiple times for a single offense, obviously violating the principle of "no double jeopardy" in the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War.

In September 1951, POW Yin Nanfu from the 72nd Regiment was taken for interrogation for talking in his sleep, beaten with a stick for each question. Later, he was punished to lie down from midnight until dawn, and the next day, he was punished to break stones. POW Hu Kaixing was punished to lie down for two hours in December 1951 in the 11th Detention Center of the 2nd POW Camp in Busan for running in place to keep warm due to the cold weather and thin clothing. Such unreasonable and arbitrary punishments are extremely common in POW camps.

The "punishments" imposed by the U.S. military camp authorities on POWs completely disregard the respect that POWs should receive for their person and honor. The methods are so barbaric that they are beyond the imagination of civilized people. In February 1952, POW Jin Liancheng from the 72nd Regiment was punished to squat down with his hands raised straight and a sandbag weighing about 100 pounds placed on his knees for urinating while on duty. Jin Liancheng was then kicked by the U.S. military when he was knocked down by the sandbag. He was forced to stand up again and had the sandbag placed on him for about ten more minutes until he fainted.

The detention cells, earth cells, and prisons set up by the U.S. military camp authorities are dark and have no sunlight. POWs detained without reason can only sleep on the cold ground with a piece of torn blanket. For example, POW Liu Ziqiang and ten others from the "H" camp of the 8th POW camp on Jeju Island were arbitrarily detained in this kind of detention cell for 33 days starting from December 5, 1952. POWs Sun Zhenguan and Zhang Zeshih from the 602nd POW Camp on Geojedo Island were also arbitrarily detained in the "maximum confinement" prison directly under the control of the U.S. military police commander's guard division for 113 days, causing their bodies to be severely damaged (Attachment 24).

The U.S. military camp authorities also set up water cells in POW camps to detain POWs. On March 17, 1952, POW Yao Wenjian from the 3rd Wounded POW Detention Center of the 2nd POW Camp in Busan was punished to sit in a water cell for 15 days for urinating outside the toilet due to his disabled legs and difficulty in moving.

The U.S. military, when illegally punishing POWs, does not distinguish between officers and POWs of equal rank. They often use various excuses to detain officers and POWs of equal rank and impose various illegal punishments, such as stripping them naked and exposing them to the rain. For example, POWs Liu Guang and five other officers from the 4th Battalion (officer battalion) of the 72nd Regiment on Geojedo Island were detained in the "isolation" barbed wire enclosure and were punished to lie down for two hours each day and were beaten (Attachment 15). Officers Wang Fang and Luo Xingyi were arbitrarily detained in prisons and earth cells for a long time, suffering torture and humiliation (Attachment 25).

Illegal Punishment of Wounded POWs

The methods used by the U.S. military camp authorities to punish wounded POWs are also unprecedented in cruelty.

The U.S. military often uses cruel methods such as cutting off food and water and stopping medical treatment to punish wounded POWs. For example, from April 16 to May 22, 1952, the U.S. military authorities of the 2nd POW Camp in Busan cut off food and water for 7 to 12 days and stopped medical treatment for 32 to 37 days for the wounded POWs in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Wounded POW Detention Centers who refused the illegal "screening." On the third day of the food cut-off, the wounded POWs were forced to eat tree leaves, grass roots, and even boiled broken shoes and belts; many wounded POWs' wounds became infected, rotted, and infested with maggots (Attachment 33). In early February 1953, more than 40 lung disease POWs in the 4th Wounded POW Detention Center of the 2nd POW Camp in Busan were forced by the U.S. military to stand naked in the snow for an hour for singing during the Spring Festival.

Many wounded POWs had their conditions worsen due to the brutal punishments. For example, in late 1951, POW Zhang Yuanlong from the 4th Wounded POW Detention Center of the 2nd POW Camp in Busan was severely ill and his hands trembled, accidentally breaking a thermometer. A U.S. major immediately forced him to remove his pants and sit in a water cell for about an hour and a half. The water cell was very dark, and the water was about half a meter deep. Due to sitting in the water cell, his condition worsened. POW Zhou Guangyu from the 1st Wounded POW Detention Center was ordered by a U.S. sergeant to do hard labor in late August 1952. Zhou could not stand due to his illness and was beaten. Many wounded POWs protested to the U.S. military, but the sergeant punished Zhou to sit in a water cell for four months, causing his condition to worsen.

Collective Punishment

Collective punishment incidents occurred most frequently in the 8th POW Camp on Jeju Island. The 8th POW Camp detained more than 6,000 Chinese People's Volunteer POWs who openly expressed their desire to return to their country. The U.S. military camp authorities were extremely hostile to their open expression of the desire to return to their country. Therefore, they used various cruel methods such as hunger, forced labor, and even personal humiliation to impose collective punishment, or punished the collective for individual behavior, which violated Article 87 of the Geneva Convention. For example, on July 7, 1952, POWs from the "E" camp went to the seaside to dump feces. A Korean civilian smiled at POW Guo Zhihua, and the U.S. military stabbed Guo Zhihua. All the POWs immediately protested, but the U.S. military not only did not punish the culprit but also cut off their food for four days from July 8 to 11 and cut off their water for one day. On September 25, 1952, 35 cooks from the "D" camp were punished to break stones for half a day for singing while carrying food. On October 4, 1952, POWs from the "D" camp were doing physical exercises, and the U.S. military, under the pretext of needing 100 people to work, obstructed them. The POW representative agreed to send people after the physical exercises, but Major Brooks arbitrarily punished all the POWs in the camp to break stones for one day and cut off their food for three days and water for one day.

The U.S. military often punishes POWs for singing and often punishes the entire group for the singing of a few. For example, on September 17, 1952, 400 POWs from the "F" camp went out on duty, and 25 of them sang. The U.S. military arbitrarily detained all of them in a hangar and froze and starved them for 48 hours. On September 27, more than 100 Chinese People's Volunteer POWs from the "G" camp went to the seaside to work. Fifty or more of them sang, and a U.S. major and a captain, with a company of U.S. military, forcibly took away the interpreter of the camp and punished all the POWs to be exposed to the sun for three hours and cut off one meal; in the afternoon, they were again punished to move large stones on the seaside, and the U.S. military used bayonets to injure 26 POWs, seriously injuring four and lightly injuring 22. On November 13, the U.S. military cut off two-thirds of the food and water for the POWs in the "I," "G," "E," "C," "A," "J," "H," "F," and "D" camps for four and a half days because they sang.

Chapter 7: Forced Detention of POWs

The U.S. military authorities, in violation of international law, forcibly detain Chinese People's Volunteer POWs against their will. This plot to forcibly detain POWs is carried out systematically under the direction of the U.S. military authorities.

The U.S. military authorities, in order to forcibly detain POWs, sent a large number of special agents from the remnants of the Kuomintang in Taiwan and special agents who had received special training in Tokyo and other places to POW camps to carry out various special activities. They established the "June 3" branch of the Kuomintang on Geojedo Island, the so-called "CIE" school (Attachment 20), and various special organizations to persecute POWs, forcing POWs to sign "blood letters," tattoo themselves, and undergo illegal "screening." They also carried out large-scale massacres of POWs; after the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, they did everything possible to sabotage and obstruct the work of the Chinese People's Volunteer POWs' interpretation team, making it impossible for POWs to freely exercise their right to repatriation.

1. Illegal "Screening"

The purpose of the U.S. military authorities' "screening" of Chinese Communist Party members, members of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and Chinese People's Volunteer officers is to create a terror atmosphere in POW camps to facilitate the detention of POWs. The U.S. military authorities, as early as February 1951, instructed special agents to illegally "screen" Chinese Communist Party members, members of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and Chinese People's Volunteer officers in POWs to carry out persecution. Large-scale "screening" began in July 1951. During the "screening," the U.S. military camp authorities gave specific instructions to the special agents in the POW camps. For example, a colonel from the U.S. military police command on Geojedo Island, a major from the U.S. intelligence agency "G-2" who claimed to be Wang, Captain Bootb from "CIE," and American special agent Wu Bogui, disguised as a religious figure, separately instructed special agents Lin Ruliang and Li Da'an to "screen out" Chinese Communist Party members, members of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and Chinese People's Volunteer officers and "strictly control" them, and subject them to severe beatings or kill them (Attachment 26). In the 72nd Regiment on Geojedo Island alone, more than 2,000 POWs were severely beaten. For example, POW Xue Delao was subjected to hanging, pressing with a bar, and burning with gasoline; Meng Qingzhang was subjected to needle torture and electric shock (Attachment 19); Sun Wenqing was killed by special agents pouring boiling water into his anus.

2. Signing "Blood Letters"

From July 1951 to April 1952, the U.S. military authorities forced POWs in the 72nd and 86th Regiments on Geojedo Island to sign "blood letters" to the "United Nations" and Chiang Kai-shek more than eight times, falsely claiming that POWs did not want to return to their country. For example, in November 1951, when the preparations for negotiations on the exchange of POWs were being made at Panmunjom, Captain Bootb immediately arranged for special agents Wang Shunqing and Li Da'an to sign "blood letters" on behalf of the entire POW camp. These "blood letters" were all forged, signed by special agents, and forced POWs to sign. For example, in the 72nd Regiment, special agents in the POW camp forged two "blood letters" on behalf of all POWs in late November 1951 and February 1952. On the night of mid-November, POWs were forced to sign "blood letters" without knowing in advance. They were woken up from their sleep and taken to the battalion headquarters to be forced to prick their fingers and press their blood prints. Most POWs were beaten for refusing to sign "blood letters." For example, POW Jin Fu from the 4th Battalion was beaten more than 30 times by special agents; a POW surnamed Guo from the 1st Battalion was stripped naked and forced to kneel on broken stones. He still refused to sign, and the special agents forcibly pricked his finger and pressed his blood print; those who still refused to sign after being beaten were, like other POWs who went out to do hard labor, all had their blood prints pressed by special agents.

3. Tattooing

The U.S. military authorities also used the barbaric act of "tattooing" to forcibly tattoo slogans against the will of POWs on their bodies. This illegal tattooing activity began in July 1951. In October 1951, special agents Zhang Bo from the remnants of the Kuomintang in Taiwan instructed special agents Wang Shunqing and Li Da'an in the 72nd Regiment to force a large number of POWs to get tattoos. At the end of November, former commander of the U.S. Far East Command, General Ridgway, visited the 72nd Regiment. Special agents ordered POWs to remove their shirts and expose the slogans "Anti-Communism and Anti-Russia" and "Anti-Red" tattooed on their arms. Ridgway encouraged this. After that, the 72nd and 86th Regiments began large-scale activities of using torture to force POWs to get tattoos. Before the "screening" in April 1952, special agents in the 86th Regiment organized a "tattoo class" to specially persecute and kill POWs who refused to get tattoos. For example, in the 2nd Battalion of the 86th Regiment, special agents used sticks and water torture to force POW Wang Chunlai to get a tattoo (Attachment 27); in the 1st Battalion of the 72nd Regiment, POW Wang Wu was beaten unconscious, and special agents took the opportunity to tattoo him; in the 4th Battalion, POW Lu Shujin was branded with a hot iron by special agents (Attachment 28). POW Huang Yingxuan from the 11th Detention Center of the 2nd POW Camp in Busan was also tortured for refusing to get a tattoo. Special agents used a tent pole with a sharp end to pierce his head, causing his brain nerves to be injured and his right half of the body to be paralyzed. Many POWs were killed for refusing to get tattoos. For example, POWs Tan Jiu and Zhao Chaozhou from the 72nd Regiment were strangled to death by special agents; POW Zheng Donghai from the 86th Regiment was killed by special agents after being forced to drink hot pepper water and then branded with a hot iron.

4. Illegal "Screening"

In April 1952, the U.S. military authorities conducted two illegal "screenings" in the 86th and 72nd Regiments on Geojedo Island.

A week before the illegal "screening," Major Rony from the so-called "CIE" school and Captain Ronye, who was in charge of managing the 72nd Regiment, instructed special agents Wang Shunqing and Li Da'an: "This 'screening' must not let anyone leave! If anyone leaves, it will be bad for the 'United Nations'." Special agent Zhang Bo from the remnants of the Kuomintang in Taiwan also instructed Li Da'an and others to organize an "assassination team" to massacre POWs who openly expressed their desire to return to their country (Attachment 26). Before and after this, special agents Wu Bogui, disguised as a religious figure, and special agents Han Binghe from the Li Chengwan regime, along with U.S. military sergeant Cro, sent a large number of knives and tent poles with U.S. markings to special agents in the POW camps to harm POWs who openly expressed their desire to return to their country (Attachment 29).

The first illegal "screening" of POWs in the 86th and 72nd Regiments was conducted on April 8 and 9. This is the infamous April 8 massacre on Geojedo Island. On April 6 and 7, the U.S. military camp authorities broadcasted and allowed special agents to threaten POWs. After the U.S. military camp authorities broadcasted, special agents in the 86th and 72nd Regiments created a terror atmosphere by beating and killing POWs. According to a relatively detailed investigation, in the 72nd Regiment alone, more than 1,000 POWs were beaten on April 7 and 8, of which 560 were seriously injured; 250 were mutilated; Zhang Zhenlong and others were killed by special agents. On the night of April 8, in the large iron shed of the so-called "CIE" school, POW Lin Xuepu shouted "Long live the Communist Party!" in the midst of the beating and was killed by Li Da'an, who also disemboweled him! That night, Cao Lixing and others were also killed by special agents. On the morning of April 9, Yang Wenhua, who insisted on returning to his country, was also beaten to death by special agents. In the 86th Regiment, Zhao Wenjiang, Ren Daomu, Qi Zhongtang, and Tang Kaijian and others were killed by special agents on April 7 and 8.

On April 8 and 9, the U.S. military camp authorities conducted illegal "screening" of POWs in the 86th and 72nd Regiments. U.S. military police and a large number of special agents with sharp weapons and sticks stood at the camp gate. Special agents from the 86th Regiment, such as Ying Xiangyun, shouted, "No one can live to return to the mainland!" A POW surnamed Shi from the 72nd Regiment was stabbed to death by special agents when he walked to the gate and was detained; then another POW was killed at the gate. When disabled POW Zhou Jitao bravely walked to the camp gate despite the knives and sticks, he was forcibly dragged to the double barbed wire fence (those dragged into the barbed wire fence were forcibly detained).

This illegal "screening" resulted in nearly 2,000 POWs from the 86th and 72nd Regiments bravely demanding repatriation to the 602nd POW Camp (Attachment 31).

Nearly 2,000 POWs who arrived at the 602nd POW Camp immediately strongly protested against the U.S. military camp authorities' bloody "screening." They demanded to dig up the bodies of the massacred Chinese People's Volunteer POWs and send all the forcibly detained Chinese People's Volunteer POWs to the 602nd POW Camp to return to their country together.

The U.S. military camp authorities did not respond to the POWs' protests for a long time. Meanwhile, they secretly moved and burned the bodies of the massacred POWs. It was not until May 3 and 7, 1952, that Brigadier General Dodd, Captain Lode, and Major Brooks, along with POW representatives Sun Zhenguan and others, went to the 72nd and 86th Regiments to dig up the bodies. Although the U.S. military camp authorities had destroyed the evidence in advance, they still dug up many blood-stained clothes and charred bones in these camps (Attachment 32).

After the first "screening," under the strong protests of POWs in the 602nd POW Camp, the U.S. military camp authorities conducted a second illegal "screening" from April 16 to late April. This "screening" was also conducted under the threat of special agents' sticks and butcher knives. Moreover, the "screening" was not announced to the POWs in advance, so only about 200 POWs from the 86th and 72nd Regiments bravely went to the 602nd POW Camp despite the danger to their lives.

The U.S. military authorities also conducted illegal "screening" in the 2nd POW Camp in Busan from April to May 1952. The U.S. military authorities' plot to forcibly detain POWs was exposed by the wounded POWs in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Wounded POW Detention Centers of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer wounded POWs, who unanimously refused the "screening." The U.S. military camp authorities cut off the food and water supply to the wounded POWs for 7 to 12 days and stopped medical treatment for 32 to 37 days, attempting to force the wounded POWs to accept the illegal "screening." During this period, the wounded POWs' conditions worsened, their wounds became infected, rotted, and infested with maggots, and they were starving. But the wounded POWs still firmly refused the illegal "screening." After the failure of this plot, the U.S. military camp authorities mobilized armed forces with tanks, 60mm cannons, machine guns, and poison gas shells on May 21 to massacre the wounded POWs in the 3rd Wounded POW Detention Center. This is the infamous May 21 massacre in the Busan Wounded POW Camp. In this massacre, 190 wounded POWs from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer were killed or injured; on May 22, the U.S. military threw poison gas shells at the wounded POWs detained in the 2nd Wounded POW Detention Center of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer, causing all the POWs to be poisoned. The severely poisoned numbered more than 270, and three died. After the massacre, the U.S. military conducted "screening" of the wounded POWs in the 3rd and 2nd Wounded POW Detention Centers, and many wounded POWs from the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer were forcibly detained (Attachment 33).

5. Intensified Persecution of "Non-Direct Repatriation" POWs

After the U.S. military authorities conducted illegal "screening" in Geojedo Island, Busan, and other POW camps in April 1952, they moved more than 14,000 Chinese People's Volunteer POWs who were unable to express their will to return to their country due to the brutal persecution by the U.S. military authorities and special agents in the POW camps to Jeju Island, establishing the 9th POW Camp. The U.S. military authorities and the remnants of the Kuomintang in Taiwan, under their instructions, further strengthened their terror rule over the POWs. Special agents restricted the POWs' every move, and the POWs were in danger of being killed at any time.

In late June 1953, the U.S. military camp authorities and the remnants of the Kuomintang in Taiwan again illegally forced POWs to tattoo slogans of the Chiang Kai-shek gang and the Kuomintang party emblem and flag on their arms, chests, and backs. Those who refused to get tattoos were beaten or even killed. POWs Wang Kang and Yang Jiefu were killed by special agents Wang Qian and Hu Zhengming on the night of June 28 for firmly refusing to get tattoos. After their deaths, the special agents hung their bodies on the beams of the iron shed. A POW surnamed Zhou was also beaten to death by special agents. According to a Reuters report from Seoul on August 14, more than 80 Chinese People's Volunteer POWs who refused to get tattoos were isolated and imprisoned by the U.S. military, and one of them was killed. The remnants of the Kuomintang in Taiwan, "Ambassador to Korea" Wang Dongyuan, also sent special agents Du Guangtai and others, disguised as "U.S. military translators," into the POW camp to force POWs to prick their fingers and press their blood prints on a petition to Chiang Kai-shek.

On August 2, the U.S. military camp authorities openly broadcasted Chiang Kai-shek's speech to the POW camp on Jeju Island. Later, the remnants of the Kuomintang in Taiwan organized a "comfort team" led by special agent Fang Zhi, who arrived in South Korea by plane on August 25. They distributed Kuomintang party flags, emblems, portraits of Chiang Kai-shek, and "comfort letters" to the POWs on Jeju Island, openly carrying out the plot to forcibly detain POWs.

In the Busan POW Camp, the U.S. military camp authorities also arranged for special agents to carry out various criminal activities aimed at detaining POWs.

The Chinese People's Volunteer POWs who were forcibly detained, although under the strict control of special agents, still had some who risked their lives to demand to return to their country. For example, POWs Tian Chongzeng and Gui Rangpin. After their return, they exposed and accused the U.S. military authorities' crimes of forcibly detaining POWs (Attachment 34).

Chapter 8: Forced Recruitment of POWs as Spies

The U.S. military authorities, in violation of international law principles, used deception and threats to force Chinese People's Volunteer POWs to become "U.S. military intelligence agents," sending them into the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China to gather military intelligence and various secrets. This has been confirmed by many Chinese People's Volunteer POWs who were forced to become spies and were sent to North Korea by the U.S. military, as well as by the already repatriated Chinese People's Volunteer POWs.

The U.S. Far East Command Liaison Group, from August 1951 to April 1953, secretly selected Chinese People's Volunteer POWs from the 72nd Regiment, 86th Regiment on Geojedo Island, and the 9th POW Camp on Jeju Island, dividing them into nine batches and sending them to the U.S. Far East Intelligence School for spy training. A total of 188 people have been identified. The first batch of 14, including Yang Lin, was in Daegu, Korea; the second, third, and fourth batches of 74, including Pan Jie and Zhang Wenrong, were in Tokyo, Japan; the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth batches of 95, including Wang Sen, were in Seonjab Island, Korea. In addition, five more were sent to the U.S. military intelligence agency in Seoul for training. The training time (including internship time) for each batch was about 20 days to one month. The courses included intelligence, weapons, deception, parachuting, organization of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, geography, memory, and observation methods (Attachments 35, 36).

After the POWs completed their spy training and underwent a short internship, they were dispatched by the U.S. Far East Command Liaison Group Seoul Detachment (U.S. Far East Command Liaison Group, Seoul Detachment, code 8240) Tactical Intelligence Operations Section (Tactical Lane Operation Section, abbreviated as T.L.O.), using methods such as parachuting, coastal infiltration, and frontline infiltration, to the frontline and rear areas of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to gather military intelligence on the strength, types, artillery positions, and supply lines of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, and to investigate the effects of the U.S. military's biological warfare. They also attempted to infiltrate into the territory of the People's Republic of China to gather various intelligence.

The process of POWs being forced to become spies

The U.S. military authorities used deception to transfer Chinese People's Volunteer POWs from the POW camps on Geojedo Island and Jeju Island, each time 10 to 20 people. After being transferred, they were individually interrogated by U.S. special agent Wang (a Chinese-American, short and fat, with a dark face and pockmarks). After the interrogation, the POWs were detained in a specially set-up barbed wire enclosure, changed out of their clothes with "P.W." (prisoner of war) markings, and secretly transported by ship and plane to the intelligence school. Along the way, they were escorted and monitored by the U.S. military. The trucks that the POWs rode in were covered with tarpaulins, and they were strictly forbidden to speak or look outside. None of the POWs knew where they were being sent or what they were going to do. At the same time, the U.S. military authorities listed this batch of POWs as "escapees" or "deceased."

After being taken to the intelligence school in Tokyo, the school's director, U.S. military lieutenant William Davis, announced: "You are no longer POWs, but 'United Nations' intelligence agents." The POWs were extremely indignant at the U.S. military's deception and some even risked their lives to refuse training, resulting in persecution by the U.S. military. On February 29, 1952, POW Wang Shanjian was taken to the intelligence school for training by the U.S. military. The school's deputy director, Mizuno (an American-Japanese), told him that he would receive training as a "United Nations" intelligence agent. Wang Shanjian immediately stated: "I will not do any work, and after the war ends, I want to return to China." Mizuno became furious and said: "Once you are here, you cannot decide for yourself. If you do not become a 'United Nations' intelligence agent, it will be detrimental to your life." Wang Shanjian replied: "Even if I die, I will not do something against my conscience," and was then taken away. His whereabouts were unknown. Similarly, after being interrogated by Mizuno, POW Peng Renshan expressed that he would rather die than become a spy. The school's spy instructor, Kim Yeonggam (a Korean), threatened: "You must realize where you are! It will not be good for you if you insist on not doing it." Then Mizuno forcibly took Peng Renshan's hand and pressed his fingerprint on an English card that he did not recognize. The POWs who were secretly taken to the intelligence school were all forced to write autobiographies, take photographs, and press their fingerprints on English cards in this situation. The intelligence school then used this as a tool to further blackmail the POWs.

The intelligence school strictly controlled the POWs' thoughts and forced them to write a daily diary about their mental state, which was reviewed by the spy instructor.

The intelligence school's forced spy training of POWs was highly secretive. When the intelligence school was in Tokyo, the school authorities had more than ten rules, prohibiting the POWs from moving freely and speaking loudly in Chinese. If they heard the bell, they had to quickly hide in the room and not be seen by outsiders, etc. After the intelligence school moved to Seonjab Island, the U.S. military forced all the island's residents to move away, and non-spy agency ships were strictly prohibited from approaching the island.

The fate of POWs after being forced to undergo training

Under the threat of the U.S. military, POWs who were forced to undergo spy training often resisted in various ways during the training period and before being dispatched. The following incidents occurred.

1. Disappearance

In November 1951, POW Guo Baotong was imprisoned for refusing to accept spy work. The U.S. Far East Command Liaison Group Seoul Detachment special agents Wang Yunge and Kim Lijiu repeatedly threatened him: "If you insist on not going, you will know the consequences in a few days!" On the night of November 27, a U.S. lieutenant led three U.S. soldiers with guns to take Guo Baotong away in a jeep. Wang Yunge and Kim Lijiu went with them. Later, Wang Yunge and Kim Lijiu returned, but Guo Baotong did not. The other POWs who were training saw Kim Lijiu using Guo Baotong's lighter to smoke and asked about Guo Baotong's whereabouts. Kim Lijiu vaguely replied: Guo Baotong had already "gone to work" and left the lighter as a souvenir. But since then, no one has seen Guo Baotong.

At the end of December 1952, POW Wen Chuanji was stripped naked and frozen for 24 hours for refusing to accept spy training. At around 10 p.m. that night, a U.S. soldier and a Li Chengwan constable took Wen Chuanji away. Wen Chuanji has been missing since then.

2. Imprisonment

The U.S. military's minimum method of oppressing POWs who did not want to do spy work was imprisonment. According to incomplete statistics, POWs who were imprisoned in the detention cells of the U.S. military spy agency in Seoul included Guo Baotong, Xu Jin, Han Linxiang, Li Lishang, Zhang Yaozu, Ma Xionglong, and Zhang Haoxian. In the detention cells, they were stripped of their clothes, their blankets were taken away, they were given barely edible food, and if they were sick, no one took care of them. POW Xu Jin was imprisoned for nine months, and U.S. military spies often threatened him: "You must know what kind of agency this is! You are already our 'employees,' and if you do not obey orders, you will not be able to leave alive!"

3. Escape and Suicide

The POWs did not want to become spies and could not bear the pressure from the spy agency, so they attempted to escape or even commit suicide.

On the night of April 6, 1952, the third batch of POWs, Yu Di and Jin Ge, who were training, escaped from the U.S. military spy agency in Seoul because they did not want to do spy work and could not bear the pressure from the U.S. military. On April 7, U.S. military spy Wang and Lieutenant William Davis were afraid that the spy agency's address would be exposed, so they took the other POWs in three batches to another small courtyard in Seoul. The small courtyard was surrounded by a three-meter-high brick wall with only one door, guarded by Li Chengwan's military and increased armed patrols, strictly guarded.

On the night of April 7, the U.S. military spy agency in Seoul forced the POWs to leave. POW Li Lishang used the rifle given to him by the spy agency to commit suicide, with the bullet passing through his left armpit and falling to the ground but not dying. Before Li Lishang committed suicide, he wrote a suicide note saying, "The United States claims to protect human rights, but why force POWs to become spies? I am a Chinese, and I will not be a sacrifice in the United States' war gambling." The next day (April 8), after Li Lishang committed suicide, POW Wang Naiyong escaped over the wall.

4. POW Zhang Wenrong Blows Up a U.S. Plane

On February 19, 1952, POW Zhang Wenrong, who was forced to parachute into North Korea to gather military intelligence, threw a hand grenade into the cabin of the "C-46" type plane he was on before jumping, destroying the plane. Zhang Wenrong landed after parachuting and immediately surrendered to the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, exposing the U.S. military's forced spy training and dispatch process (Attachment 37). These are all evidence of the U.S. military's crimes of forcing POWs to become spies.

    序言
      一九五○年六月二十五日，美国政府发动了对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的侵略战争。在这一战争中，美国军事当局严重地违反日内瓦公约与国际公法原则的规定，对中国人民志愿军被俘人员进行了种种的迫害和虐待，包括屠杀在内。
    中国红十字会为了申张人道原则、维护日内瓦公约和国际公法原则，曾向已被遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员进行访问，听取他们的控诉，又参照了已捕获的美军空降特务的供词，以及其他有关材料，经过了慎重的、反复的、忠实的对证，我们认为：美国军事当局虐待和屠杀战俘的罪行是确凿无疑的。
    兹将调查所得的美国军事当局迫害与屠杀中国人民志愿军被俘人员之种种事实，公布于全世界人民面前。
    第一章  屠杀战俘
    美国军事当局在侵略朝鲜的战争中，对于在其武装力量控制之下的中国人民志愿军被俘人员，包括：在战场上失去战斗力之人员、未及撤离战区之病、伤人员、战地医院中的住院人员、及在美军战俘营中的被拘留人员，曾施以各种虐待和屠杀。此种行为，严重地违反了一九四九年八月十二日关于战俘待遇之日内瓦公约第一部第三条、第二部第十三条及一九四九年八月十二日改善战地武装部队伤者、病者境遇之日内瓦公约第二章第十五条、第三章第十九条之规定。
    据被遣返之中国人民志愿军被俘人员所提供之材料，业经证实：自一九五○年十一月到一九五三年七月，美军残杀中国人民志愿军被俘人员共计二千六百多人。
    美国军事当局在屠杀中国人民志愿军被俘人员的暴行中，曾使用刺刀、自动步枪、卡宾枪、轻机关枪、重机关枪、六○炮、手榴弹、毒气弹、火焰喷射器、装甲车、坦克等武器及火烧、“打活靶”、活埋、挖心、勒死等等残暴杀害方法。被遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员目睹了美国军事当局及其所属部队残杀战俘的行为，其中有些人是这些屠杀事件的幸存者，现身上尚留有伤痕。
    （一）
    美国武装部队及归属美军指挥之李承晚军，在战场上对于中国人民志愿军被俘人员和伤、病被俘人员，予以残忍之杀害。兹据业经证实之材料统计，中国人民志愿军被俘人员被害人数计达二千三百五十多人，由个别杀害，以至集体大屠杀。其主要事件如下：
    许多中国人民志愿军被俘人员，一经被俘即遭杀害。一九五一年五月二十一日，在洪川以东地区，中国人民志愿军重伤员李唯义等三十多人，被美军俘虏后，即被当场打死（附件一）；一九五一年五月二十九日，在麟蹄以北地区，美军枪杀中国人民志愿军及朝鲜人民军被俘伤员一百四十多人，内有中国人民志愿军伤员八十多人；一九五一年九月十四日，侵占金城南黑云吐岭地区之李承晚军，屠杀了被俘之中国人民志愿军重伤人员五十多人  （附件二）；一九五一年五月三十日，在麟蹄地区，美军屠杀中国人民志愿军被俘伤员二十多人；一九五一年五月，在涟川东南云川里附近，李承晚军屠杀中国人民志愿军被俘伤员七十多人。一九五一年十一月，中国人民志愿军部队收复金城东科湖里附近一阵地时，发现十一月七日被敌方军队杀害之战士尸体，死者手脚都被捆绑并拴在树上，遍身都有伤痕，显系被俘后遭受杀害。
    许多中国人民志愿军被俘人员，是在被押离作战地区后或押送途中被残杀的。一九五○年十二月一日，美军第二师所属部队在由平安南道价川郡中西里撤退时，以机枪射杀中国人民志愿军被俘人员三十一名。死者胸前并挂有“战争俘虏”纸片；一九五○年十一月二十八日，在朝鲜北部球场地区，美军在撤离该地区之前，屠杀中国人民志愿军被俘人员四十多人；一九五一年五月下旬，被押送到大田附近之中国人民志愿军被俘人员三十多人，被集体杀害；一九五一年五月二十八日，李承晚军在鸡冠村附近以刺刀刺死中国人民志愿军被俘伤员一名，三十日，在水原至大田公路上美军又以汽车辗死中国人民志愿军被俘人员四名（附件三）。
    特别残暴的是，美国武装部队及李承晚军对陷入其手的中国人民志愿军战地医院、伤病人员转运站之非武装人员及伤、病被俘人员。一九五一年五月二十七日在涟川以南一山上，美军以机枪杀害在中国人民志愿军战地医院中被俘伤员一百三十多人（附件四）；五月，在东线华川地区，李承晚军枪杀中国人民志愿军伤员一百多人（附件五）。一九五一年五月二十七日午前九时，美军八十多人以机枪、自动步枪屠杀在麟蹄地区中国人民志愿军战地医院中伤员二百二十多人（附件六）；一九五一年五月二十七日，在华川附近，美军枪杀中国人民志愿军被俘伤员二十多人，并纵火烧死在战地医院中被俘伤员十多人。
    还有许多中国人民志愿军被俘人员，被美军及李承晚军因追索军事情报、抢劫财物、强奸女战俘而被杀害的。
      一九五一年五月二十八日，在春川西北明月里发生了美军及李承晚军残杀二百八十多名中国人民志愿军被俘人员大血案。美军侵占这一地区之后，即以机枪、自动步枪等向躺在地上和防空洞内的伤员射击，二百八十多名伤员中仅刘春荣（拘留号码七三一一二五）幸免于死亡（附件七）。
    美军及其指挥下的李承晚军对于在战地被俘的中国人民志愿军伤员及其他人员所施之残暴杀害，亦为被中国人民志愿军俘虏的美军人员及李承晚军人员所证实。被中国人民志愿军俘虏的美第二师第二战斗营HS连士兵奥托·贝尔（军号：RA——一八二七六六一八）证实了一九五○年十一月三十日，在顺川和军隅里之间，李承晚军集体屠杀中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军两百多名被俘人员的事件。被俘的美第二十四师第十九步兵团第一连士兵菲利普·R·安德逊（军号：RA——一一一七九一七八）的报告，证实了美军及李承晚军活埋战俘事件
  （附件八）。曾被我中国人民志愿军俘虏的李承晚军第二师士兵崔珍桢证实了一九五○年十一月六日，在下碣隅里公路上，美海军陆战队第一师所属部队屠杀一百多名中国人民志愿军被俘人员事件。另一被俘的李承晚军士兵金再龙说，他曾在一九五一年十一月十三日，看到有两名中国人民志愿军被俘人员被当“活靶”打死。
    （二）
    已被拘禁在美军战俘营中的中国人民志愿军被俘人员，也被美国军事当局及战俘营管理当局肆无忌惮地、大规模地集体屠杀，把战俘营变成“死亡营”。据业经证实的材料统计，在美军管辖的战俘营中，自一九五一年六月到一九五三年七月止，已经查知有二百四十多名中国人民志愿军被俘人员惨死在美军枪弹、刺刀、手榴弹、毒气弹及其他残忍之杀害手段下面，三百余名战俘被打伤或残废。其中有三次大规模的集体屠杀战俘的事件。
    上列数字是不完整的，美国军事当局实际屠杀战俘之数字，远远超过此数。
    美军战俘营管理人员、营场卫兵及美国军事当局派遣到各战俘营中的台湾中国国民党残余集团特务分子，恣意杀害战俘，横行无忌。一九五一年七月，在釜山战俘营，美军卫兵无故开枪射击战俘居住之帐篷，打死中国人民志愿军被俘人员王炳忠；一九五二年五月十六日，在巨济岛第六○二号战俘营，美军打死中国人民志愿军被俘人员王化义；一九五二年七月八日，美军卫兵打死中国人民志愿军被俘人员张东海（附件九）；一九五二年八月下旬在釜山战俘营，李承晚军开枪打死中国人民志愿军被俘人员李万清；一九五二年十月二十七日在济州岛第八号战俘营，美军枪杀中国人民志愿军被俘人员胡树森；一九五二年十二月十四日，美军枪杀中国人民志愿军被俘人员范杰（附件十）等。
    在一九五二年二月到五月间，美国军事当局为强迫扣留（即美方所谓“自愿遣返”）中国人民志愿军被俘人员，在战俘营中进行了大规模的、野蛮的、迫害战俘的行动，制造了一连串的屠杀战俘的血案。中国人民志愿军被俘人员赵潮洲、谭九、许贵、袁宗文等人因拒绝强迫在自己身体上刺“反共抗俄”违反自己意志的字样而被杀害；中国人民志愿军被俘人员张振龙、唐开建、林学普、戚忠堂、杨文华等人，在美国军事当局强行非法“甄别”时，因公开表示回国，遭受杀害。
      自一九五一年到一九五二年期间，美国军事当局对战俘营中中国人民志愿军被俘人员进行了三次大规模的集体屠杀。一九五一年八月十五日夜十时，美国军事当局派遣武装部队并开出坦克、装甲车十数辆，突然包围釜山第二号战俘营第二、第三、第四、第六、第七战俘收容所，以机枪、自动步枪向在营场内的朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军被俘人员密集射击，当场打死、打伤朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军被俘人员共达六十多名，据初步调查有二十多人被打死（附件十一）。一九五二年五月二十一日晨七时半，美国军事当局派遣武装部队，并开出坦克、装甲车十三辆，包围釜山第二号战俘营第三病伤战俘收容所，由一美军中校军官指挥美军以机枪、自动步枪、毒气弹、六○炮等武器向营场内的朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军被俘人员射击，并以手榴弹向战俘居住之帐篷投掷。据不完全统计，美军在这次屠杀中共计打死、打伤朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军病、伤被俘人员一百九十多人，内有杨廷华等三十五人被打死（附件三十三）。
    一九五二年十月一日，在济州岛上，发生了震惊世界的“十·一血案”。美国军事当局以济州岛第八号战俘营“H”号营场内六百多名手无寸铁的中国人民志愿军被俘人员为攻击目标，在十月一日早晨七时许，进行了空前残暴的集体大屠杀。美军第八号战俘营总管白乐摩上校、军官布鲁克斯大尉直接指挥。美军打死许多在营场内空场上的战俘，而且追入各帐篷残杀战俘。在这一屠杀中有六十五名中国人民志愿军被俘人员被杀死，近一百名中国人民志愿军被俘人员负重伤和残废。营地洒遍了死者、伤者的鲜血（附件十二）。
    美国军事当局在残杀中国人民志愿军被俘人员的事件中，不只使用了现代化杀人武器，并且使用了活埋、灌水、挖心、火烧、钉死、烙刑、刀杀、棒打等数十种残暴杀害方法。中国人民志愿军被俘人员曹利兴、张振龙等被用刀子杀死；中国人民志愿军被俘人员王康、杨介甫、左文刚等被以绳索勒死；中国人民志愿军被俘人员王少奇、雨时杰等被以乱棒打死；中国人民志愿军被俘人员郑东海等人被向口内或肛门内灌水并火烙其腹而死；中国人民志愿军被俘人员许贵被以铁钉钉死；中国人民志愿军被俘人员任道木被以汽油烧死，一九五二年四月八日夜，美国军事当局派遣到战俘营中的特务李大安等杀死了中国人民志愿军被俘人员林学普后，残暴地挖出了林学普的心，李大安手拿着血淋淋的心在战俘营中恫吓示众。这一令人发指的杀人暴行，是在美国军官的指使下发生的（附件二十六、三十一）。
    美国军事当局对战俘营中中国人民志愿军被俘人员所施之野蛮的暴行，亦已为美国、英国通讯社所报道的消息，以及美军战俘营军官所证实。兹据美国、英国各通讯社所透露的不完全的数字计算，自一九五一年七月到一九五三年七月止，共有三千四百三十八名朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军被俘人员在美军战俘营中被打死和打伤。其中，死者有六百二十四人。这个数字，显然是大为缩小的。
      一九五二年五月在巨济岛所发生的“杜德事件”中，在当时美军战俘营总管柯尔生准将签署、并经美军战俘营总管杜德准将所补充的给朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军战俘代表团的复信中，亦肯定地承认了美国军事当局曾野蛮残杀朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军被俘人员的事实（附件十三）。
    以上事实证明，美国军事当局违反日内瓦公约和国际公法原则，残暴地杀害了大量的中国人民志愿军被俘人员。这种对战俘大规模屠杀的暴行，是在美军高级军事机关及美军高级将领的策划和支持下有计划地进行的。这里所指的是美国远东军总司令部，及前美国远东军总司令、联合国军总司令李奇微将军，前美国远东军总司令、联合国军总司令克拉克将军，前美第八军军长范佛里特将军。
    第二章  非法审讯
    美国军事当局严重地违反了一九四九年关于战俘待遇之日内瓦公约第十七条之规定：“对战俘不得施以肉体和精神上之酷刑或任何其他胁迫方式借以自彼等获得任何情报。战俘之拒绝答复者不得加以威胁，侮辱，或使之受任何不快或不利之待遇”及第八十七条之规定，竟非法地对中国人民志愿军被俘人员普遍地进行了追索各种情报的审讯，并残暴地施用吊打、压杠子、刀刺、割肉、刺指甲缝、过电、灌辣椒水、关水牢、关刺笼等酷刑（附件十四）甚至处死。
    美国军事当局公开审讯战俘的机关，有“美国远东军总部情报处”（G—2）、“战争罪犯调查科”（War  Criminal  Investigation
  Section）、“反情报队”（Counte  Intelligence  Corps）、“战争罪犯调查处”（War  Criminal  investigation  Department）及在战俘集中地区设立的“宪兵司令部”等。美军不仅在上述机关非法审讯战俘，而且在前线、在战俘转运途中、在战俘营和在战俘医院里，美军军官、宪兵、军医、台湾中国国民党残余集团特务和李承晚特务等随时随地都对战俘进行非法审讯。战俘普遍遭到此种非法审讯，即使身负重伤，亦不能幸免。
    自济州岛第八号战俘营“F”号营场已遣返的五百一十一名中国人民志愿军被俘人员全部均遭受过非法审讯，其中有四百四十二人曾遭受各种酷刑。占全部人数的百分之八十六以上。兹将受刑人数、种类、次数分述如下：受刑种类受刑人数共受刑次数过　电　一六人　四○次吊　打　一二人　一八次火　刑　三人　三次灌辣椒水　一人　一次压杠子　一人　一次割肉　四人　四次刺刀刺　六人　六次用鞭或木棒拷打　一九八人　三三七次冰　冻　二人　二次打伤口　三人　三次殴打和其他　二一六人　二八三次
    在前线，美军对中国人民志愿军被俘人员曾进行酷刑审讯。如郝永成于一九五一年三月十五日在中线龙头里附近被俘后，美军在审讯中，把他双手背绑，用布蒙住眼睛，拖进稻田水中，一连泡了三天半，下身起泡、浮肿。余凤安在中线白石山被俘后，被美军连续进行五天五夜的审讯和吊打。更残暴的是，美军对被俘的中国人民志愿军伤员，毫不顾及其伤势，在审讯中施以酷刑。如头部负伤的杨运田，于一九五一年五月二十四日在北汉江南岸被俘后，美军一少尉在审讯他时，竟用枪托击打他的头部，并施电刑两次，杨运田伤口流血过多，昏迷不醒数日。
    美军在战俘转运途中，亦进行酷刑审讯，甚至每到一处，就审讯一次。如刘光於一九五一年四月二十二日在铁原附近负伤被俘后，在转运途中遭到五次非法审讯。在审讯中，美军中校、少校等军官，对他施用了火烧手指、铁棍痛打、绳勒、过电等刑（附件十五）。又如郑献民于一九五一年二月十八日在砥平里附近负伤被俘的当天，在转运途中，曾经过了四个换药站。美军因他拒绝审讯，不但不给他换药，还用力扭转他的已经骨折的左腿；张连治在被转运途中，亦遭到同样的残害。
    在战俘营里，美军更疯狂地、不分昼夜地非法审讯战俘。战俘周连生于一九五一年二月，被美军押到釜山“战争罪犯调查科”的阴暗潮湿的地窖里，监禁四十二天，受电刑七次，冰冻八小时（附件十六）。赵志奎于一九五一年九月二十九日在釜山第二号战俘营第一病伤战俘收容所时，被一美军大尉逼问军事情报，遭到棒打、过电、灌辣椒水等刑、停止治疗八天，致使伤口化脓、溃烂（附件十七）。巨济岛第七十二联队战俘白玉山，在一九五一年十月受审讯时，被六个特务绑起用铁棒打关节骨、刀子刺小腿、火烧皮肉；白玉山全身发肿，遍体鳞伤。
    美军这种残酷的非法审讯，在战俘医院里的战俘，亦不能免。战俘张炳荣，一九五二年六月在巨济岛战俘医院时，因拒绝美军非法审讯，三个美军就往他嘴里灌污水。医院当局为了追索各种情报，在炎热的六月天，在病房里生起四英尺高的火炉，把门窗紧闭，使病、伤战俘个个汗流如注，痛苦不堪。
    在审讯中，美国军事当局除了逼问各种情报外，竟用非刑强迫战俘承认为“战犯”而将其囚禁。战俘田天明，于一九五一年七月六日在巨济岛，被一美军少尉审讯，美军少尉用两根七寸长的铁钉，钉入他的右大腿根，逼迫他承认打死一名美军俘虏，此后，就被当作“战犯”监禁起来。巨济岛第七十二联队战俘金星国，在一九五一年十一月二十九日被美军押到“战争罪犯调查科”，逼迫他承认杀死十七个美军俘虏。金星国驳斥说：“中国人民志愿军对俘虏是宽待的，从来没有杀过俘虏。”当即遭到灌凉水、过电等酷刑。最后，美军竟无耻地强拉他在写有杀死一个美军俘虏的纸上，按了指印，就以“战犯”之名，囚禁起来（附件十八）。战俘孟庆章（附件十九）等，亦被美军硬指为“战犯”而被囚禁。
    美国军事当局，对战俘酷刑审讯，致使许多战俘成为残废。例如战俘李伯林，一九五一年年底在巨济岛第六十一号战俘营受审讯时，被一美军大尉及特务打断脊骨。美军在酷刑审讯中，亦常常将战俘处死。战俘刘凤江，于一九五一年十一月二十日，在春川曾目睹一美军大尉在审讯戈真美、张桂枝（女）时，施用电刑后，并用木棒将他们打死。
    第三章  生活虐待
    美国军事当局完全违反一九四九年八月十二日关于战俘待遇之日内瓦公约第三部第二段第二章战俘之住宿、饮食、衣服与卫生设备等规定，使战俘
  （包括病伤战俘在内）长期遭受饥饿，健康受到摧残，以致战俘营中疾病丛生，战俘身体瘦弱，体重惊人地减轻。下面就是关于美军战俘营管理当局在饮食、衣着、居住等方面虐待战俘的事实。
    饮食方面
    美军战俘营管理当局供给战俘食用的粮食，大部分是发霉的，有些是没有脱去皮壳的，且掺有砂土。战俘的主要粮食是大麦和少量的豌豆、碎大米，或者是小麦和已经霉坏的大麦粉。全部战俘
  （病伤人员也不能例外）每人每餐只能吃到半碗饭；吃发霉的大麦粉时，每人每餐只能得到一个比鸡蛋略大的约四、五两重的面团。因此战俘无时无刻不处在饥饿状态中。
    副食品同样质劣量少，缺乏营养且不卫生。白菜是烂的；萝卜是老得空了心的；干鱼片长了很多虫；在菜里有许多小虫。即使这样，每人每餐的半小碗“菜汤”里，也只有二三片白菜叶和萝卜片。在一九五二年上半年以前，有时每人每日尚能得到四百分之一磅的肉类（每人仅能得到罐头肉类约一点二五克），一九五二年下半年以后，就根本没有见过肉。美军战俘营管理当局发给济州岛第八号战俘营战俘的干鱼片，每人每日平均也只有约三十至六十克（Gram）。
    战俘不仅长期受饥饿，而且得不到足够的水喝。在巨济岛第六○二号战俘营，拘禁了五千多名中国人民志愿军被俘人员，只安装有口径二公分的水龙头一个，而且每天只放水两小时，过了早晨八点钟美军就把水管关闭。一九五一年夏天，巨济岛第七十二联队七千余人仅有的一根水管，也被规定每天只放水两小时。
    因为水少人多，煮饭发生很大的困难。水量少，煮成的饭常常半熟半生；蔬菜不能洗，只有带着泥土投到锅里。至于饮水，更为艰难。巨济岛第七十二和第八十六联队，在水龙头下设一水桶，战俘们须排列成队依次领水，每人每日只能领到一小碗水。战俘们口渴难忍，只有喝污水沟里的脏水，或在做苦工时，不顾美军的殴打喝一口海水。
    美军战俘营管理当局还任意断绝战俘的粮、水供应。釜山第一、第二和第三病伤战俘收容所，于一九五二年五月十一日开始，曾遭美军战俘营管理当局无理断粮断水七天至十二天。一九五二年十月四日，济州岛第八号战俘营“D”号营场，也被美军战俘营管理当局无理断粮三日。（以上详见非法处罚战俘章）
    战俘为了生存，迫不得已在战俘营中挖坑取水，但又遭到美军战俘营管理当局蛮横的禁止。如巨济岛美军战俘营管理当局，即曾勒令第七十二联队战俘把所有的土坑都填平。在一九五二年七月八日济州岛第八号战俘营“G”号营场遭美军无理断水时，战俘渴极挖井，美军竟开枪打死战俘张东海，打伤毛有才。
    衣着方面
    每个战俘的衣服和私人财物等都在被俘时被美军和李承晚军抢掠。
      一九五一年七月，巨济岛美军战俘营管理当局发给战俘红色和黄色的短袖单衣和短裤。每人只有一套。无法洗换。而且，很多人穿着这样单薄的衣服过冬。战俘们冻得发抖，很多人的手脚都冻得红肿、开裂、流黄水。一九五一年冬，在巨济岛第八十六联队六大队十六小队六十余名战俘中，就有三十四人冻伤，冻伤重者七名；一九五二年冬，济州岛第八号战俘营六千多人中，也有二千七百人手脚冻破溃烂。在“A”号营场五百多人中，有四分之三的战俘被冻伤。战俘白金堂、倪万福等二十余人的脚冻烂露出脚骨。美军对被冻伤的战俘非但不予应有的医疗，反令照常做苦工。
    战俘在做苦工时拾些烂纸、稻草和烂麻袋围在腰间和缠在脚上以取暖。但是，美军和各战俘营里的台湾中国国民党残余集团的特务反认为这是“损伤联合国的尊严”，就给战俘以种种残酷的处罚。
    拘留在釜山第二号战俘营之病伤战俘，他们中大部分人长期得不到衣服穿。如战俘丁振芳在第一病伤战俘收容所时，自一九五一年八月至一九五二年八月，一年未穿衣服，只有披着破毯子；沙荣章于一九五一年冬季在第二病伤战俘收容所时，因没有衣服和鞋袜，冻伤斑斑，行动艰难，美军却借口他走路迟缓，在他屁股上戳了几刺刀。
    战俘们的破烂衣服，没有针线缝补，因此衣服愈加破烂不堪。
    美军战俘营管理当局给战俘发的鞋子，都是美军士兵穿过了的破皮鞋，而且所发数量极少，很多战俘都没有鞋穿。
    美军战俘营管理当局从来没有给战俘发过袜子。
    居住方面
    战俘居住在帐篷里或铁棚子里。一个帐篷长约十公尺，宽约五公尺（当中有约一公尺宽的通路，在路之两侧，各睡一排人），一般的要容纳五十到八十人，每人睡觉所占的宽幅为十五公分到二十公分（釜山第二、三病伤战俘收容所约为三十公分）。战俘睡觉时只能侧身，一颠一倒，挤压得不能翻身。一九五一年十月时，釜山第十一收容所一个帐篷曾住过二百人，有很多人被挤到帐篷外露宿。
      一九五一年十月以后，各战俘营陆续把帐篷改建为铁棚子，铁棚子长约四十五公尺，宽约五点五公尺，里面要容纳三百多人。从面积上看居住的情况似乎应该好一些，但实际上比帐篷更为拥挤。少数特务占去铁棚子的一半，剩下的才是一般战俘容身的地方。因此，每人占的宽幅只有十二公分到十五公分。战俘们每日在繁重的劳役之后，有些人只有抱膝蹲着打一下盹，无法入睡。
      冬天，铁棚子里非常冷。在第七十二联队，一个铁棚子里只有一个火炉，但每天供给的煤量极少，等不到铁棚子里有点暖气，煤就烧尽了。每个战俘冬天只发给两条（夏天只有一条）像麻袋似的破毯子，冬夜，战俘经常冻得不能入睡。
    巨济岛各战俘营的帐篷和铁棚子，都建立在稍加平过的稻田上。战俘睡在地上，铺着薄薄的稻草席子，因为太潮湿，席子下面生着一层白毛，战俘因此而患病的很多，由巨济岛迁往济州岛的六千余名战俘中，患疥疮者二千五百人，患关节炎者七百三十人。
    帐篷都是破旧的，雨天漏水，战俘只能互相依靠蹲着。如遇风暴，帐篷被吹垮，战俘就只好在大雨中淋着，毫无躲避的地方。
    因为居住拥挤，地面潮湿，经常不能洗澡不能洗衣，特务们又限制战俘自由活动，帐篷和铁棚子的门窗经常不准打开，因此，帐篷和铁棚子里空气十分污浊。
    铁棚子和帐篷内光线暗淡，黑夜无灯。
    卫生设备方面
    按照关于战俘待遇之日内瓦公约第二十九条之规定：“拘留国应负责采取保证战俘营清洁卫生及防止传染病所必要之卫生措施。”但是，美军战俘营内却连最起码的卫生设备都没有，甚至战俘连洗脸、理发都很困难，至于沐浴和洗濯衣物就根本谈不到。
    根据被遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员提供的材料证实：因为战俘营内缺少水，战俘们洗脸是件不容易的事，平常要一个星期有时要一个月才能洗一次脸，而且是几十个人在一个盆内洗。
    美军战俘营管理当局给十几个人才发一把牙刷，或是只给牙粉，不发牙刷。因此战俘们长年不能刷牙。作为战俘理发用的刮脸刀片，两个月甚至四个月才发一次，十五到五十人才能分到一个刀片。可是一个刀片剃发三次就钝了。在这种情况下，战俘们的头发长的很长。
    在巨济岛第七十二、第八十六联队中，每一千二、三百人只有一个设有十个便桶的厕所，因此，战俘的大小便就发生了极大的困难。加以战俘因饮食不良，喝生水和脏水，经常约有百分之三十、多时达百分之八十的战俘患腹泻，而厕所的缺乏使他们的大小便更加困难。
    各战俘营虽然都先后设立了所谓“浴室”，但因为没有水，他们没有一个人洗过澡，而“浴室”却通常被用来作为吊打战俘的刑室。
    战俘们因长期不能洗澡，没有衣服可换，衣服、毯子、头发上都生有很多虱子、虮子。
    在美军战俘营管理当局的百般虐待下，战俘营中各种疾病流行，严重地损害了战俘的健康。
    根据在战俘营担任医务工作的中国人民志愿军被俘医务人员王泽英（拘留号码七三○四四五）、左连臣（七一○三四五）、李冰云（七○六一○一）、张景荣（七一六二三四）等提供的材料证实：在战俘营中，患痢疾者极普遍。一九五二年七月到八月间，济州岛第八号战俘营“A”号营场五百五十名战俘中，有四百余人患痢疾。
    患夜盲症和结膜干燥症者也很多。如一九五一年七月间第八十六联队的战俘因严重的缺乏营养，百分之四十到五十的人患结膜干燥症。第八号战俘营六千余名战俘中有三千七百四十多人患夜盲症。
  “A”号营场的十一小队六十八人中有四十三人因害眼病而视力减退。如战俘宋国英，每到夜间就不能行动。
      一九五二年三月间，美军医官亲自到第七十二联队挑选战俘，送往第七十号战俘营作苦工，当时七千多人中只挑选出近一千五百人，其余皆是身体羸弱、残废、眼病较重者及夜盲症者。
    战俘营中无防蚊设备，因之，患疟疾者也很普遍，在一九五二年夏季，济州岛第八号战俘营有三千三百余人患疟疾。
    其他如患贫血症、胃病、疥疮、关节炎等，在各战俘营内是极普遍的现象，此外，尚有许多战俘患肺病和支气管炎等。
    战俘长期在极端恶劣的生活折磨下，体重惊人的减轻。如王同心（曾被拘留在济州岛第八号战俘营“A”号营场），被俘前体重为六十八公斤，遣返归来时降到四十八公斤，减轻约百分之三十。以上事实有力的证实了美军战俘营管理当局在生活上虐待战俘的罪行。
    第四章  精神虐待
    根据一九四九年八月十二日关于战俘待遇之日内瓦公约第二部第十四条、第三部第二段第五章第三十四条、第三十八条及第五段第七十一条等条款之规定，战俘在精神生活上应享受人道之待遇。但是，美国军事当局为了扣留战俘，对战俘施行精神迫害，对中国人民志愿军被俘人员强制进行反动政治教育；公然派遣特务以宗教作为掩护，借传教为名对战俘施行恐吓、欺骗宣传。此外，还使用了种种限制战俘精神生活自由的手段。
    一、强制进行反动政治教育
    美军战俘营管理当局为了改变战俘的政治信仰，于一九五一年八月到十月，公然派遣蒲斯大尉（Capt.Booth）、台湾中国国民党残余集团特务张兴登、张启德、张弼、甘碧英和王纪中等在巨济岛第七十二、第八十六联队中设立所谓“反共”学校，对战俘强制进行反动政治教育，和阻挠战俘回国（附件二十）。先后由特务李琪、刘秉章、刘承汉、王家悌和程立人等担任校长、教务主任和教员等。每天上课四次，每次两小时，各大队战俘轮流听课。战俘对此种反动教育，极为厌恶，拒绝接受。战俘营中特务就用棒子强将战俘押进教室。中国人民志愿军被俘人员对特务侮辱自己祖国极为愤慨，如敢挺身驳斥、则遭到拷打、罚趴、罚跪，甚至酷刑。如第八十六联队战俘杨庭宇，上课时不愿听，被拖出教室用棒子打四肢关节，还罚趴。战俘袁玉山，讨论时拒绝发言，特务把他吊打后，又罚他跪在雪地上冻了一夜，并关了一天禁闭。战俘刘有才在“共产主义是极权主义”的测验题下划了一个“ 一”号（即否定之意），特务把他拖出去，毒打一顿，并剥光他的衣服，从肛门往肚里打水，又用脚踏他涨大了的肚子，他鼻口都冒血水。
    台湾中国国民党残余集团特务除了公开对战俘强制进行以上反动教育外，还秘密指使战俘营中的特务强迫战俘“签血书”、“刺字”及阻挠战俘回国的活动。
    二、以宗教作为掩护进行特务活动
    美国军事当局为了达到其不可告人的目的，竟公开派遣吴博礼（Woodberry）、韩秉赫和一个自称苏“神父”的特务，以宗教作为掩护，在巨济岛第七十二、第八十六联队进行特务活动。他们假借做“礼拜”、“祷告”，对战俘进行恐吓。
    战俘对他们这种假借传教进行卑鄙的特务活动，极为愤恨，拒绝去听他们的所谓传教。于是，美军宪兵、特务就用棒子将战俘赶去，不去的就要挨打、受罚。战俘被赶去后，如果不低头、不专心听、不照着念他们那些宣传反动政治的陈词滥调，也要遭到毒打。如第八十六联队李忠等二十多人因为不跟着他们念，结果每人挨了四十手板。
    美军派遣的这些以宗教外衣作为掩护的特务，除了以上假借传教对战俘进行恫吓、欺骗活动外，还直接和间接的残害战俘。一九五一年巨济岛第七十二联队特务开始强迫战俘刺字的时候，吴博礼指示国民党“六三”支部书记长魏世喜强迫四大队
  （军官队）战俘刺字。刺后，吴博礼并照了相。一九五一年十月间，吴博礼、韩秉赫曾供给巨济岛第八十六联队特务刀、锹、镐和棒子等，殴打战俘。吴博礼并曾亲自将战俘李五阳叫到一帐篷内非法审讯，强迫要他承认是中国共产党党员、中国人民志愿军军官。李五阳坚决不承认，吴博礼就打了他几耳光，叫特务将李五阳拖去毒打。一九五二年四月初美军对战俘进行“甄别”前，吴博礼、韩秉赫曾多次往第七十二联队运送带有U、S字样的刀子，供给特务作为威吓和杀害战俘的武器（附件二十九）。如一九五二年七月十八日，那一个自称苏“神父”的特务和美军大尉奥斯门（Osman）、少尉狄德（Diddle），率领一排美军冲入济州岛第八号战俘营“H”号营场，向战俘喷射糜烂性、腐蚀性液体，战俘一百六十五人中毒受伤。
    三、剥夺战俘学习文化和娱乐的权利
    美军战俘营管理当局对战俘完全出于自愿的学习和娱乐，却以各种手段阻挠、破坏。
    济州岛第八号战俘营和釜山第二号战俘营战俘，在极端缺乏学习用具的情况下（战俘个人所有的钢笔、笔记本等物，皆在被俘时被搜去），自己用废铁片制成笔尖，用锅烟代替墨水，拣回破纸片学习文化。美军战俘营管理当局竟以检查卫生为名，在进行武装搜查中，把战俘的学习用具全部抢走和破坏。
    至于战俘的正当娱乐连唱自己喜爱的歌曲，也横遭美军战俘营管理当局的禁止，甚至受到断粮断水的处罚以致屠杀。一九五二年七月十八日，第八号战俘营“H”号营场战俘就因唱歌，遭受美军投掷毒气弹和喷射腐蚀性、糜烂性液体的伤害。同年八月十五日，“F”号营场亦因此受到同样的残害。此外，像战俘在平时做苦工时轻轻唱祖国歌曲而遭到美军毒打或刺伤的事件，是经常发生的。
    四、侮辱战俘人格
    关于战俘待遇之日内瓦公约第十四条明文规定：“战俘在一切情况下应享受人身及荣誉的尊重。”但是美军却处处使用各种卑鄙的手段，侮辱战俘人格。一九五二年九月二十七日上午，美军上校杜维亚（Col.Due）在济州岛机场上布置了约一营武装美军，并附有四十余挺轻重机枪，命令第八号战俘营“H”号营场全体战俘脱光衣服和鞋子，赤裸裸地向他敬礼。我被俘人员不堪此侮辱而拒绝敬礼，当即遭到美军拳打脚踢，或用刺刀乱刺，有唐根培、赵义等二十余人被刺伤。一九五三年二月，第八号战俘营战俘被押出作苦工时，美军故意把口香糖纸扔在地上强迫一姓宋的战俘拣起来，该战俘拒绝，美军竟将其枪杀。
    通信，是战俘应有的权利。关于战俘待遇之日内瓦公约第七十一条规定：“战俘应准其收寄信件及邮片”、“此等信件及邮片必须由拘留国以其所有最迅速方法转递之，不得以纪律理由而缓递或扣留。”但是，美军战俘营管理当局完全剥夺了战俘这一权利。一九五三年元旦及春节时，美军战俘营管理当局在第八号战俘营战俘多次要求后，第一次应允给予战俘通信的权利，但同时又加以很多限制。当战俘写好了几千封信交其寄回祖国时，美军战俘营管理当局却藉口暴露了战俘生活的真实情况，扣留了这些信件（附件二十一）。
    一九五二年六月二日美军战俘营总管波纳
  （Boatner）曾在致中国人民志愿军被俘人员的备忘录中称：“汝等之国旗可于汝等之国庆悬挂之……。”但是，战俘在一九五二年十月一日升旗庆祝祖国国庆时，美军却背弃自己的诺言，屠杀战俘，造成死伤战俘一百六十五人的大血案。
    第五章  强迫战俘从事非法劳动
    美国军事当局公然违反一九四九年关于战俘待遇之日内瓦公约，武力强迫被拘留于釜山、巨济岛、济州岛等地战俘营中的中国人民志愿军被俘人员（包括病伤人员），在美军兵营、码头等处，不分昼夜地、终年从事繁重的、且毫无报偿的劳动，其中包括日内瓦公约明文禁止的军事性质的劳动。战俘所从事的劳动是在衣食不足、体力不支及美军战俘营管理当局毫不顾及当地气候状况的情况下进行的。美军对从事劳动的战俘，任意侮辱、毒打和惩罚。战俘在劳动中，因缺少工具与保护装备而造成了严重的疾病和伤残，以至死亡。
    被迫从事繁重劳动的战俘的生活条件，十分恶劣。他们每天只能吃到三半碗用杂粮做成的饭，饥饿无力。他们从一清早就被驱使到劳动场所，不分昼夜地从事繁重的劳动。夏天，战俘穿的是袒露四肢的短衣裤，被炎日曝晒得退皮、肿疼，以至晕倒；冬天，战俘穿着不能御寒的单薄的衣服，被迫在寒风、雪地里从事劳动，很多战俘的手脚和脸被冻伤。
    美军战俘营管理当局违反一九四九年日内瓦公约第五十三条的规定，强迫许多战俘无休止地从事劳动。以巨济岛第七十联队为例，该联队拘禁有中国人民志愿军被俘人员一千五百余人，美军战俘营管理当局，每日白天向该队要九百到一千人，夜间要五百到六百人从事劳动，而该联队除伙房等人员约二百人外，实际从事劳动的，只有一千三百人。因此，其中有一百至二百人必须日以继夜地从事劳动。尤其严重的是在一九五二年三月下旬到四月上旬约二十天中，美军战俘营管理当局曾连续六次向该联队白天要一千二百人，夜间要七百人，这样，每次要有六百人连续从事劳动二十四小时。例如战俘金桂安在此期间，就曾四次从事此种超度劳动。
    根据一九四九年日内瓦公约第四十九条之规定：“拘留国得斟酌战俘之年龄、性别、等级及体力，并特别以保持战俘之身心健康为目的，而利用体力合格之战俘之劳动”，而美军战俘营管理当局却以武力强迫年龄、体力很不相宜的战俘和战俘中之军官、特别是病伤战俘，从事各种繁重的劳动。他们之中，常有累得吐血，或因而使病势加重以至死亡的。如战俘戴金成年仅十八岁，在一九五二年六月间，曾被美军强迫与另一战俘抬重约二百斤的大石头，他只抬了一天便吐了血。巨济岛第八十六联队陈启厚在一九五一年九月间从事劳动时，被美军用木棒乱打全身，当时吐血，以后病势加重，每隔两三月咯血一次，每次连续十余日，致成严重的肺病。病伤战俘孙治谦等，在被迫从事繁重的劳动中，身体受到了严重的摧残（附件二十二）。另据已被遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员田志诚控诉：他曾亲眼看到釜山第二号战俘营第二病伤战俘收容所患有肺病的战俘董玉仲等三人，于一九五二年五月二十三日至二十六日，被美军武力强迫连续修了四天铁丝网，结果，三人病势加重，其中董玉仲因而死亡。
    美军战俘营管理当局强迫战俘从事的劳动种类繁多：其中有折磨性的劳动，如搬石头、砸石头等。特别严重的是：美军不顾日内瓦公约第五十条之规定，以暴力强迫战俘从事军事性质的劳动，如装卸和搬运伪装的装有毒气弹、手榴弹壳、炮弹、子弹、卡宾枪、轻重机枪等木箱；挖掘掩体工事；建筑防空洞、军火库、军用汽油塔等军事设备。
    在劳动中，美军任意以皮鞭毒打战俘，以刺刀刺伤战俘，并施以侮辱性和集体性的惩罚。惩罚的种类有数十种，如罚肩负重物跑步，赤脚在碎石地上跑步，甚至延长劳动时间和断粮断水等。济州岛第八号战俘营第“E”号营场战俘李凤明等十人，于一九五三年二月二十七日为美军搬运汽油桶时，一美军无故罚李凤明趴下，当即为李凤明拒绝，美军即用石块将李凤明的两颗牙齿打坏，嘴部打得鲜血直流。全体战俘对美军此种无理暴行提出抗议，美军反扣粮水两顿。巨济岛第八十六联队第四大队第十三小队战俘张治清、张进德等六十人于一九五一年七月间某天，为美军砸石头时，美军藉口砸得慢，罚张治清等六十人脱光衣服趴下，曝晒于烈日下。当即有田双根等晕倒。济州岛第八号战俘营“E”号营场战俘韩月季等二百二十五人于一九五二年九月十三日为美军挖水沟时，因抗议美军剥夺他们的休息权利，美军即以四辆坦克和两排武装士兵，把他们押送到一个潮湿而窄的飞机库里扣押起来，并断粮断水三十二小时。在闷热、劳累和饥渴的情况下，当即有战俘曾德均、刘建福等十六人昏倒。夜间，美军并无故开枪击伤蒲学林、郭云清等三人。
    美军战俘营管理当局驱使战俘从事劳动，缺少工具，根本没有保护设备，且带有极大的危险性，因此，不断地造成战俘的伤残与死亡。战俘在砸石头时，即因缺少工具，手脚经常被砸伤。济州岛第八号战俘营“H”号营场战俘王勇超于一九五二年九月，在码头装卸大木箱时，被起重机的大吊钩砸伤左腿。该战俘营“J”号营场战俘刘永合等二人，在为美军卸货时，亦被起重机大吊钩撞伤（附件二十三）。又据已遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员陈文义、杨志远、李忠等证实：一九五一年九月间，巨济岛第八十六联队第五大队战俘谭新武等三十余人被迫在巨济岛上一座土质十分疏松、眼看就要倒塌的陡坡下挖土，土坡突然塌下，当将谭新武等三人压死。
    第六章  非法处罚战俘
    美军战俘营管理当局，经常毫无理由地而且是极其残暴地非法处罚战俘。战俘的一言一行，都被作为“惩处”的借口，就是病伤人员或军官，也不能幸免。
    美军非法处罚战俘的手段花样很多，诸如断粮断水、停止医疗、打、趴、坐水牢、土牢、监禁于无日光之监狱和无休止的疲劳服役等，都是惯用的。
    美国军事当局这种公然违反一九四九年八月十二日关于战俘待遇之日内瓦公约的行为，是绝对不能容许的。身受残酷虐待的中国人民志愿军被俘人员在控诉中，揭露了美军战俘营管理当局及台湾中国国民党残余集团特务的种种罪行。
    对个人的非法处罚
    关于战俘待遇之日内瓦公约第十三条规定：“战俘在任何时须受人道之待遇。拘留国任何不法行为或不法行为可致其看管中之战俘死亡或严重危害其健康者须予禁止，并当视为严重破坏本公约之行为。……”
      “战俘亦应在任何时受到保护，尤其免致遭受暴行或恫吓及侮辱与公众好奇心的烦扰。”
    “对战俘之报复措施应予禁止。”但被拘禁在巨济岛第七十二、第八十六等联队中的中国人民志愿军被俘人员，常常被施以各种处罚。并且因一种借口而受到连续数次之处罚，显然，这是违反了关于战俘待遇之日内瓦公约第八十六条“一罪不再罚”的原则。
    一九五一年九月，第七十二联队战俘殷南夫，因睡觉时说梦话，被抓去审讯，打一棒问一句。后又罚他从半夜趴到天明，第二天还罚他砸石头。战俘胡开兴于一九五一年十二月间在釜山第二号战俘营第十一收容所等候出公差，因天气严寒，衣服单薄，在原地跑步取暖，被特务罚趴两小时。类似这种毫无道理而滥施处罚，且一罪再罚的事例，在战俘营中是极其平常的。
    美军战俘营管理当局对战俘的“处罚”，完全不顾及战俘应享受之对人身及荣誉之尊重，其手段之野蛮，实非文明人类所能设想。一九五二年二月间，第七十二联队战俘金连成，因在出公差时解小便，美军罚其蹲下，双手举直，膝上放重约一○○磅的沙袋，金连成当时被沙袋压倒，美军就用脚踢；金连成被强拉起来，再次压上沙袋约十余分钟，直到昏倒为止。
    美军战俘营管理当局所设立的禁闭室，土牢和监狱，见不到阳光。无故被禁闭的战俘只能带着一条破毯子睡在冰冷的地上。济州岛第八号战俘营 “H”号营场战俘刘自强等十一人，就曾于一九五二年十二月五日下午四时左右，被美军无故关入此种禁闭室，达三十三天之久。巨济岛第六○二号战俘营战俘孙振冠、张泽石等也曾被美军无理地监禁于巨济岛美军宪兵司令部警备科直接管辖的“最高监狱”（Maximum   Confinement）内，达一百
  一十三天之久，孙振冠、张泽石等人的身体，受到严重的摧残（附件二十四）。
    美军战俘营管理当局还在战俘营设立水牢、监禁战俘。一九五二年三月十七日，釜山第二号战俘营第三病伤战俘收容所战俘姚文俭，因两腿残废，行动困难，小便在厕所外面，被美军罚坐水牢十五天。
    美军在非法处罚战俘时，完全不顾及军官及地位相等之战俘，经常以各种借口，将军官及地位相等之战俘监禁，并施以种种非法的处罚。如脱光衣服、淋雨等。巨济岛第七十二联队四大队（军官队）战俘刘光等五名军官，被监禁在“隔离”铁丝网内时，就曾被每日罚趴两小时，并遭毒打（附件十五）。军官王芳、骆星一等，无端被美军长期监禁于监狱和土牢内，备受折磨和凌辱（附件二十五）。
    对病伤战俘的非法处罚
    美军战俘营管理当局对病伤战俘的处罚，其手段之毒辣，亦闻所未闻。
    美军常以断粮断水，停止医疗等残酷手段处罚病伤战俘。如一九五二年四月十六日到五月二十二日间，美军釜山第二号战俘营管理当局对拒绝非法“甄别”的第一、第二、第三病伤战俘收容所的战俘，曾分别断绝粮水七天到十二天（幸赖其他收容所战俘忍饥节食接济，始免于饿死），停止医疗三十二天到三十七天不等。第一病伤战俘收容所断粮的第三天，战俘被迫以树叶、草根充饥，甚至连破皮鞋、皮带都煮食；许多病伤战俘的伤口，亦因得不到医疗而化脓、溃烂和生蛆（附件三十三）。一九五三年二月上旬，釜山第二号战俘营第四病伤战俘收容所第四号铁棚子四十多个肺病战俘因在春节唱歌，便被美军赶到雪地，剥光衣服冻了一小时。
    很多病伤战俘因受残暴之处罚致使病伤加重。例如：一九五一年末，釜山第二号战俘营第四病伤战俘收容所战俘张元龙，因病重，手发抖，不慎将体温表摔碎。一美军大尉即强迫他脱掉裤子，罚坐水牢约一个多小时，水牢内十分阴暗，水深约半公尺。因坐水牢，他的病更加严重。第一病伤战俘收容所战俘周光宇，于一九五二年八月底，一美军中士强令作苦工，周因病不能站立，遭到毒打。许多病伤战俘向美军提出抗议，而美军中士竟罚周坐水牢四个月，周光宇因此病势更加严重。
    集体处罚
    集体性处罚事件，以济州岛第八号战俘营发生得最多。第八号战俘营拘留着六千多名公开表示要求回国的中国人民志愿军被俘人员，美军战俘营管理当局对他们公开表示回国的行为，极为仇视。因而以各种残酷手段如：饥饿、罚作苦工、甚至人格侮辱等，施以集体处罚，或因个人行为而对集体施以处罚，这违反了日内瓦公约第八十七条。如：一九五二年七月七日，“E”号营场战俘往海边倒粪便时，一朝鲜平民向战俘郭治华微笑了一下，美军就刺伤郭治华。全体战俘当即提出抗议，美军不但不惩办凶手，反而由八日中午至十一日下午断粮四日，八日并断水一天。一九五二年九月二十五日下午二时许，“D”号营场炊事人员三十五人在扛粮途中，因唱歌被美军少校罚砸石头半天。一九五二年十月四日，“D”号营场战俘正作健身活动，美军以要一百人服劳役阻挠，战俘代表答应待健身活动毕再派人前往，大尉布鲁克斯（Brooks）竟无理罚全营场战俘砸石头一天，并扣粮三日，扣水一日。
    美军常常因战俘唱歌，处罚战俘。而且，往往因一部分人唱歌而处罚全体。如：一九五二年九月十七日，“F”号营场战俘四百人出公差，因有二十五人唱歌，美军竟扣押全体在飞机库内冻饿四十八小时。九月二十七日，“G”号营场一百多名中国人民志愿军被俘人员到海边服劳役，有五十余人唱歌，美军一少校及一大尉，率一连美军武力押走该号营场的战俘翻译，并罚全体战俘曝晒太阳三小时、扣粮一顿；下午又罚到海边搬大石头时，美军又用刺刀刺伤战俘二十六名，重伤四人、轻伤二十二人。十一月十三日，美军因第八号战俘营“I”、“G”、“E”、“C”、“A”、“J”、“H”、“F”、“D”号营场战俘唱歌，即扣战俘的粮水三分之二，共四天半。
    第七章  强迫扣留战俘
    美国军事当局违反国际公法，违背战俘的个人意志，公然以暴力强迫扣留中国人民志愿军被俘人员。此种强迫扣留战俘的阴谋，是在美国军事当局策谋下有计划地进行的。
    美国军事当局为了强迫扣留战俘，曾派遣了大批台湾中国国民党残余集团的特务和在东京等地受过专门训练的特务，到战俘营中，进行各种特务活动。他们在战俘营中成立了台湾国民党巨济岛“六三”支部，“CIE”所谓学校（附件二十）及各种迫害战俘的特务组织，强迫战俘签“血书”、刺字，非法“甄别”，大规模的屠杀战俘；在朝鲜停战协定签字后，并千方百计地破坏与阻挠中国人民志愿军解释代表团的解释工作，使战俘们无法自由行使其遣返权利。
    一  非法“清查”
    美国军事当局“清查”中国共产党党员、中国新民主主义青年团团员和中国人民志愿军军官的目的，是在战俘营中制造恐怖气氛，便于扣留战俘。美国军事当局远在一九五一年二月，就指使特务在战俘中非法“清查”中国共产党党员、中国新民主主义青年团团员和中国人民志愿军军官以进行迫害。大规模的“清查”在一九五一年七月开始。在“清查”时，美军战俘营管理当局曾对战俘营中的特务作了具体的指示。如巨济岛美军宪兵司令部的一个中校、美国特务机关“G-2”的一个自称王大尉、“CIE”的蒲斯大尉（Capt.Bootb）和披着宗教外衣的美国特务吴博礼等，曾分别指示特务印汝亮、李大安等人，把中国共产党党员、中国新民主主义青年团团员和中国人民志愿军军官 “清查”出来，“加以严格管制”，并施以严刑拷打，或杀害（附件二十六）。仅巨济岛第七十二联队遭受严刑拷打的战俘，就有两千多人。如战俘薛德劳遭受了吊打、压杠子、汽油烧手等酷刑；孟庆章被刺指甲缝及受电刑（附件十九）；孙文清被特务从肛门灌入沸水烫死等。
    二  签“血书”
    美国军事当局从一九五一年七月到一九五二年四月，曾强迫巨济岛第七十二、第八十六联队之战俘，给“联合国”和台湾蒋介石签“血书”达八次以上，谎称战俘不愿回国。如一九五一年十一月，当板门店准备谈判关于交换战俘问题时，美军蒲斯大尉即布置特务王顺清、李大安等以全战俘营名义签“血书”。这些“血书”，都是特务伪造、代签和强迫战俘签的。以第七十二联队为例：一九五一年十一月下旬及一九五二年二月，战俘营中的特务，即曾假借全体战俘名义伪造了两次“血书”。一九五一年十一月中旬一个晚上签的“血书”，战俘事先并不知道，而是被特务从睡梦中打醒后，押到大队部强迫刺破手指按的，或将战俘打昏趁其失去知觉时拉住手指按血印。大部分战俘因拒绝签“血书”而遭到毒打，如第四大队战俘金甫就曾被特务打了数十棒；一大队一个姓郭的战俘也曾被特务剥光衣服，逼令跪在碎石头上。他仍不签，特务们就硬扎破他的手指，按了血印；至于经过毒打后，仍拒绝签者，就和其他外出作苦工的战俘一样，统由特务代按血印。
    三  刺字
    美国军事当局还采用了“刺面纹身”的残暴行为，以暴力强迫战俘在身上刺上违背战俘意志的字样。此种非法的刺字活动自一九五一年七月开始。一九五一年十月，台湾中国国民党残余集团的特务张弼更指使在第七十二联队的特务王顺清、李大安等，要大量强迫战俘刺字。十一月末，前美国远东军总司令李奇微到在第七十二联队视察，特务强令战俘脱下上衣，露出臂上被迫刺上的“反共抗俄”及英文的“Anti  Red”（“反赤”）等字样，李奇微对此曾予以鼓励。此后，第七十二、第八十六联队即开始了大规模的施用酷刑强迫战俘刺字的活动。一九五二年四月“甄别”前，第八十六联队的特务，更组织了“刺字班”，专门迫害和杀害拒绝刺字的战俘。如在第八十六联队第二大队的特务，用棒打、灌水等刑，逼着战俘王春来刺字（附件二十七）；第七十二联队第一大队战俘王武被打昏后，特务趁机给他刺上字；第四大队战俘鲁淑金，被特务用烧红的铁条烙上字（附件二十八）。釜山第二号战俘营第十一收容所战俘黄应选，也因拒绝刺字，被特务用一端有尖的帐篷杆子，在脑袋上刺了个洞，致使脑神经受伤，右半身瘫痪。许多战俘因拒绝刺字被惨杀。如第七十二联队的战俘谭九、赵潮洲，被特务勒死；第八十六联队的战俘郑东海被特务从肛门里灌辣椒水后，又用烧红的铁棒烙死等。
    四  非法“甄别”
    美国军事当局于一九五二年四月间，在巨济岛第八十六、第七十二联队，分别进行了两次非法
  “甄别”。
    在非法“甄别”前一个星期，“CIE”所谓学校的罗尼大尉和负责管理第七十二联队的鲁洛大尉（Capt  Rcnye）即指示特务王顺清、李大安说：
  “这次‘甄别’，不能让人走了！假使人走了，这对‘联合国’的面子不好看。”台湾中国国民党残余集团特务张弼并指示李大安等组织“暗杀团”，以屠杀公开表示回国的战俘（附件二十六）。在此前后，披着宗教外衣的美国特务吴博礼、李承晚特务韩秉赫和美军军曹克罗等，向战俘营中的特务运送了大批有U·S·字样的刀子和帐篷杆子等，以残害公开要求回国的战俘（附件二十九）。
    美国军事当局对第八十六、第七十二联队战俘第一次非法“甄别”，先后在四月八、九两日进行。这就是著名的巨济岛四月八日的大屠杀事件。四月六、七两日，美军战俘营管理当局一面广播，一面纵使特务恫吓战俘。美军战俘营管理当局广播以后，第八十六和第七十二联队特务即以毒打、残杀战俘等，制造恐怖气氛。据比较详细的调查，在第七十二联队仅七、八两日，就有一千多名战俘挨了打，其中王洪大、李全有、李显涛、冯明亭等五百六十多人负重伤；赵天高（附件三十）、杨耀体等二百五十多人被割肉；张振龙等多人，被特务害死。八日晚，在“CIE”所谓学校的大铁棚子内，战俘林学普在乱棒声中，喊出：“共产党万岁！”被李大安杀死，并剖腹挖心！这一夜，还有曹利兴等多人，惨死在特务们的刀、棒下。九日清晨，表示坚决回国的杨文华，亦被特务打死挖心。在第八十六联队，仅七日与八日晨即有佐文刚、任道木、戚忠堂、唐开建等多人死在特务之手。
    八、九两日，美军战俘营管理当局对第八十六、第七十二联队战俘强行非法“甄别”。美军宪兵和大批特务手持利刃、木棒站在营场门口，第八十六联队特务应祥云等还大声喊叫：“谁也别想活着回大陆！”第七十二联队一个姓石的战俘往门口走时，被特务一刀刺倒在地，后被扣留；接着又有一个战俘被杀死在门口。当残废战俘周吉泰冒着刀棒往营场门口走时，被特务们暴力拖到双层铁丝网之间（被拖到铁丝网内的是被强迫扣留的战俘）。
    这次非法“甄别”，美军战俘营管理当局虽然用尽了惨无人道的残杀手段，但第八十六、第七十二联队仍有近两千名战俘冒死要求遣返到了第六○二号战俘营（附件三十一）。
    近两千名战俘到了第六○二号战俘营以后，立即严重抗议美军战俘营管理当局的血腥“甄别”。他们提出去挖掘被屠杀的中国人民志愿军被俘人员的尸体、将被强迫扣留的中国人民志愿军被俘人员全部送到第六○二号战俘营，以便一起回国。
    美军战俘营管理当局对战俘之抗议，迟迟不作答复。与此同时，却暗中将被屠杀的战俘尸体移走和焚毁。直到一九五二年五月三日和七日，杜德准将、劳代大尉和布鲁克斯大尉才虚伪地分别两次会同战俘代表孙振冠等人，赴第七十二、第八十六联队挖掘尸体。虽然美军战俘营管理当局事先毁灭罪证，但仍在这些营场内挖出许多被害者的血衣和焦骨等（附件三十二）。
    继第一次“甄别”之后，美军战俘营管理当局在第六○二号战俘营战俘的强烈抗议下，又在四月十六日到四月下旬进行了第二次非法“甄别”。这次“甄别”仍然是在特务的木棒和屠刀威胁下进行的。且事前不向战俘宣布“甄别”，因此，第八十六、第七十二联队仅有二百多人不顾生命危险到了第六○二号战俘营。
    美军战俘营管理当局于一九五二年四月到五月间又在釜山第二号战俘营强行非法“甄别”。美军战俘营管理当局这一强迫扣留战俘之阴谋，为该战俘营第一、二、三病伤战俘收容所的朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军病伤战俘所识破，他们一致拒绝
  “甄别”。美军战俘营管理当局竟断绝病伤战俘粮水供应七天到十二天不等；停止为病伤战俘治疗三十二天到三十七天不等；企图胁迫病伤战俘接受非法“甄别”。在此期间，病伤战俘病情加重，伤口化脓、溃烂、生蛆，并饿得奄奄一息。但病伤战俘仍坚定地拒绝非法“甄别”。美军战俘营管理当局的此种阴谋失败后，遂于五月二十一日，出动武装部队以坦克、六○炮、机枪等轻重武器和毒气弹，屠杀第三病伤战俘收容所的病伤战俘。这就是著名的釜山病伤战俘营的五月二十一日大屠杀事件。在这次大屠杀事件中，第三病伤战俘收容所有一百九十多名朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军病伤战俘被打死、打伤；二十二日，美军又向拘禁在第二病伤战俘收容所的朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军病伤战俘投掷毒气弹，全体战俘中毒，中毒重者即达二百七十多名，并有三名死亡。大屠杀结束后，美军即对第三、第二病伤战俘收容所的病伤战俘进行“甄别”，许多朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军病伤战俘被强迫扣留（附件三十三）。
    五  加紧迫害  “不直接遣返”的战俘
    美国军事当局在巨济岛、釜山等战俘营，于一九五二年四月强行非法“甄别”后，将因美国军事当局及战俘营中的特务分子之残暴迫害而不能表示自己回国意志的一万四千多名“不直接遣返”的中国人民志愿军被俘人员，全部移往济州岛，成立第九号战俘营。美国军事当局及在其指使下的台湾中国国民党残余集团特务更进一步加强了对战俘的恐怖统治。特务对战俘们的一举一动都施以限制，战俘随时都有被杀害的危险。
    一九五三年六月底，美军战俘营管理当局及台湾中国国民党残余集团特务再次非法迫使战俘在臂上、前胸和背上刺上蒋介石匪帮的口号和国民党党徽、党旗等，拒绝刺的人均遭到毒打甚至杀害。战俘王康、杨介甫两人即因坚决拒绝刺字，被特务王谦、胡正明等于六月二十八日晚勒死。死后，特务们又将二人尸体吊在铁棚子的梁上。一个姓周的战俘也因此被特务用木棒打死。另据法新社汉城八月十四日电透露，八十多个拒绝刺字的中国人民志愿军被俘人员被美军隔离囚禁，其中一人被害死。台湾中国国民党残余集团“驻韩大使”王东原还派遣特务杜广泰等以“美军翻译”名义进入战俘营，强迫战俘刺破手指，在给蒋介石的“请愿书”上按血印。
    八月二日，美军战俘营管理当局公然将蒋介石的讲话录音向济州岛战俘营播送。其后，台湾中国国民党残余集团又组织了以特务头子方治为首的 “慰问团”，于八月二十五日乘飞机到南朝鲜，他们向济州岛的战俘散发台湾国民党党旗、党徽、蒋介石像片和“慰问信”等，明目张胆地进行强迫扣留战俘的阴谋活动。
    在釜山战俘营，美军战俘营管理当局同样地布置特务进行了旨在扣留战俘的各种罪恶活动。
    被强迫扣留的中国人民志愿军被俘人员虽处于特务们的严密控制下，但仍有人冒着生命危险坚决要求回国。如战俘田崇增、贵让品等。他们归来后，揭发和控诉了上述美国军事当局强迫扣留战俘的罪行（附件三十四）。
    第八章  强迫战俘充当特务
    美国军事当局公然违反国际公法原则，用欺骗与威胁手段，强迫中国人民志愿军被俘人员充当“美军军事情报工作人员”，被送入朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，及中华人民共和国，刺探军事情报及各种机密。此事已由投向中国人民志愿军的许多美军空降到朝鲜北部的被迫充当特务的中国人民志愿军被俘人员，以及已遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员所证实。
    美国远东军总部联络处（U.S.Far  EasternCommand  Liaison  Group），自一九五一年八月至一九五三年四月，先后由巨济岛第七十二联队、第八十六联队及济州岛第九号战俘营，秘密调出中国人民志愿军被俘人员，分九批押往美国远东情报学校受特务训练，已查知者有一百八十八人。第一批杨林等十四名在朝鲜大邱，第二、三、四批潘杰、张文荣等七十四名在日本东京，第五、六、七、八、九批王森等九十五名在朝鲜仙甲岛。此外另调出五名至汉城美军情报机关受训。训练时间（包括实习时间）每批约二十天到一个月。训练的课程有：情报学、武器学、欺骗学、跳伞学、中国人民志愿军编制、地理、记忆法、观察法等（附件三十五、三十六）。
    战俘受特务训练完毕，并经过短期实习，即由美国远东军总部联络处汉城派遣队（U.S.Far  Eastern  Command  Liaison  Group，Seoul  Detachment代号八二四○）所属战术情报作战组（TacticalLane  Operation  Section简称T．L．O．），以空降、海岸潜入、火线潜入等方式派遣到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国前线和后方，刺探中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的兵力、兵种、炮兵阵地、运输线等军事情报和调查美军细菌战效果，并企图深入我中华人民共和国国境刺探各种情报。
    战俘被迫充当特务的经过
    美国军事当局，以欺骗手段将中国人民志愿军被俘人员自巨济岛、济州岛的战俘营调出，每次十人到二十人不等，调出后，由美军特务王大尉（美籍中国人，矮胖，面黑有麻子）进行个别审讯。审讯后，战俘被拘押在特设的一个铁丝网内，换掉带有“P．W．”（战俘）字样的衣服后，用船和飞机秘密运往情报学校。途中由美军押送和监视。战俘所坐的卡车，都有篷布严盖，并严禁说话和向外张望。战俘中没有任何一人知道自己将被送到哪里去和作什么。同时，美国军事当局便把这一批战俘列入“逃亡者”或“死亡者”的名单中。
    战俘们被押到东京情报学校后，该校负责人美军中尉威廉·戴维斯等就宣布：“你们已经不是战俘，而是‘联合国军’的情报员了”。战俘们对美军这种欺骗行为极为愤慨，有的人就冒死拒绝受训，因而受到美军的迫害。一九五二年二月二十九日战俘王善将被美军押到情报学校受训。该校副校长水野（美籍日人）对他说他将受“联合国军”情报员的训练，王善将当即表示：什么工作我也不作，等战争结束后，我要回中国去。水野大怒说：“到了此地就不能由你了，如果你不当‘联合国军’的情报员，对你生命是不利的。”王善将回答：“就是死也不做违背良心的事”，于是，他被押走，以后不知下落。又如战俘彭仁山经过水野类似的审问后，表示宁死也不做特务。该校特务教官金永灿（朝鲜人）即威胁说：你要认清这是什么地方！你坚持不干对你没有好处。接着水野就强拉着彭仁山的手在他不认识的英文卡片上盖了指印。被秘密押到情报学校来的战俘，都在这种情况下被强迫写自传、照相和在英文卡片上盖指印，情报学校便借此作为进一步要挟战俘的工具。
    情报学校为严密控制战俘思想，强迫战俘每天写一份关于思想情况的日记，交特务教官审查。
    情报学校强迫战俘受特务训练是极秘密的。当情报学校设在东京时，学校当局订有十余条规则，战俘们被禁止随意走动和大声说中国话，若闻电铃声即要迅速躲入房内，不许给外人看见等等。情报学校迁到仙甲岛后，美军强迫岛上居民一律迁走，非特务机关的船只严禁靠近该岛。
    战俘被迫受训后的遭遇
    在美军威胁下被迫受特务训练的战俘屡以各种方式表示反抗，在训练期间及派遣前，曾发生下列事件。
    一、失踪
    一九五一年十一月间战俘郭保同因拒绝接受特务工作而遭到囚禁，美国远东军总部联络处汉城派遣队特务王允阁、金立柱（朝鲜人）一再威胁他说：“你要一定不去，过两天你就知道利害了！”十一月二十七日夜，美军一少尉带领三名美军士兵持枪将郭保同押上吉普车，王允阁与金立柱随车同行。以后王允阁与金立柱两人回来，却不见郭保同回来；同批受训的战俘见金立柱使用郭保同的打火机吸烟，向之询问郭保同的下落，金立柱含糊回答：郭保同已出发“工作”去了，打火机是他留给我做纪念的。但从此以后，再没有人见到郭保同了。
    一九五二年十二月底，战俘文传基因拒绝接受特务训练，被剥光衣服冻了二十四小时。当晚十时许，突然有美军和李承晚宪兵各一名，将文传基押走。文传基从此就失踪了。
    二、禁闭
    美军特务对待不肯干特务工作的战俘的起码压迫手段是禁闭。据极不完全统计，曾被囚禁在汉城美军特务机关禁闭室的战俘，就有郭保同、徐进、韩林祥、李立强、张耀祖、马兴隆、张好贤等人。在禁闭室他们被剥掉衣服，收去毯子，每天吃的是难以下咽的饭，有病没人管。战俘徐进被禁闭了九个月，美军特务常去威胁他：“你要知道这是什么机关！你们已经是我们的‘工作人员’，不听命令就别想活着出去！”
    三、逃跑与自杀
    战俘们既不愿意充当特务，又难以忍受特务机关的逼迫，遂乃企图逃跑甚至自杀。
    一九五二年四月六日晚上第三批受训的战俘余棣和金戈因不愿干特务工作，又不堪美军逼迫，在汉城美军特务机关越墙逃走。七日，美军特务王大尉和威廉·戴维斯中尉怕暴露特务机关地址，将其他战俘分三批押到汉城另一处小院内。小院四周是约三公尺高的砖墙，只有一道门，由李承晚军看守，并增加了武装游动哨，严加防范。
    四月七日晚上，汉城美军特务机关逼迫战俘出发，战俘李立强即用特务机关发给他的步枪自杀，枪弹由左肪窝穿过，倒地未死。李立强自杀前，写有绝命书一封，内有“美国既然讲保障人权，为什么强迫战俘当特务？我是中国人，我决不做美国战争赌局的牺牲品”等语。李立强负伤后，美军特务机关派来了两个美军，将李立强所穿的伪装中国人民志愿军战士用的棉衣脱掉，用担架抬走，后即将其囚禁。李立强被迫自杀的次日（八日）晚上，战俘王乃庸越墙逃跑。
    四、战俘张文荣炸毁美机
    一九五二年二月十九日被迫空降到朝鲜北部刺探军事情报的战俘张文荣，于跳伞前向所乘“C-四六”型飞机舱内投手榴弹一枚，将飞机炸毁。张文荣跳伞着陆后，立刻投向中国人民志愿军部队，并揭发了美军强迫他们受特务训练和派遣的经过（附件三十七）。这些都是美军强迫战俘充当特务的罪证。
