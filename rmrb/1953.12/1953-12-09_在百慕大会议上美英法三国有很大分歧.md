Xinhua News Agency, December 7th: According to TASS, the US, British, and French conference was held in Bermuda on the 4th. According to reports from bourgeois news agencies and newspapers, the conference first discussed the response to the Soviet note and the issue of the "European Defense Community."

According to an Associated Press reporter in Bermuda, although the three foreign ministers initially prepared to accept the Soviet proposal to hold a four-power foreign ministers' conference in Berlin, they disagreed on the timing of the conference. News from Agence France-Presse and the "Sunday Evening Post" from Bermuda also confirmed that serious differences existed among the participants of the Bermuda conference regarding the response to the Soviet note. An Agence France-Presse reporter reported that the US representative demanded a deadline be set for the upcoming four-power foreign ministers' conference in Berlin, but the British and French representatives opposed this. The Agence France-Presse reporter went on to say: "Drafting the reply note is proving to be more difficult than expected for the Western countries. The US representative expressed doubt as to whether the reply note could be sent from Bermuda to Moscow." The "Sunday Evening Post" reporter reported: The three-nation conference "has disagreed on the issue of responding to the Soviet proposal to hold a four-power conference in Berlin… Regarding the Western response to the Soviet Union, it is said that Britain and France hope to open the door to discuss the Soviet proposal to hold a five-power conference, while the US attitude is very irreconcilable.”

On the issue of the "European Defense Community," an Associated Press reporter in Bermuda pointed out that the United States opposed "any delay" and attempted to force France to accelerate the ratification of the "European Defense Community" (European Army) plan under the current circumstances. According to an Associated Press reporter, Eisenhower, Churchill, and Bidault issued the following communique after a meeting on the 5th: "The heads of the delegations, accompanied by their foreign ministers, continued their meeting this afternoon. After discussing the reply to the Soviet note, they began to preliminarily exchange views on the European Defense Community issue." However, the Associated Press reporter went on to point out that the phrase "the heads of the delegations" was actually incorrect; because France stated that Laniel did not attend the meeting and was replaced by Bidault. Premier Laniel's "absence has drawn people's attention." The reporter wrote: "It is rumored outside the meeting that Laniel is trying to get rid of the internal political struggle over the European Army issue, because he hopes to be elected President of France." A United Press reporter in Bermuda speculated that Laniel's illness might be a "diplomatic tactic," and said: "Many people believe that because the Prime Minister is very interested in the French presidential election, he has to be careful and dare not intervene in the discussion of the European Army issue in any form."

According to an Associated Press reporter in Bermuda, official representatives are "completely secretive" about the work of the conference. A Reuters reporter in New York wrote: "The New York Herald Tribune" editorial said that the Bermuda conference showed potential for sharp divisions. Each country is prepared to put forward its own preferred program.

Xinhua News Agency, December 8th: TASS, New York, December 7th: According to reports from correspondents in Bermuda, the heads of government of the United States, Britain, and France held a meeting on the 6th. As on the 5th, French Premier Laniel did not attend the meeting. The three foreign ministers also held a meeting at the same time.

After the meeting, Churchill and Eisenhower issued the following communique:
"The heads of government of the three countries and their foreign ministers continued to discuss European issues and will turn to discussing Far East issues tomorrow. French Foreign Minister Bidault explained France's attitude towards the European Defense Community issue at the heads of government meeting."

A United Press reporter wrote: "Due to complaints about the 'leaks' after the first meeting, the US, British, and French representatives made a 'pact of silence,' after which they became cautious in their words and deeds."

It can be seen from news reports that the Far East issue was also discussed at the meeting on the 6th. During the meeting, disagreements arose among the participants. For example, an Associated Press reporter pointed out: "Another item on the agenda of today's meeting (i.e., the 6th) was an exchange of views on the situation in Asia. The differences between the three Western countries are the greatest on this issue.… According to authoritative sources, Churchill told Eisenhower that Britain believes that trade with Russia and China is extremely important for Britain's interests.… Today's meeting was strictly confidential. Other items on the agenda of today's meeting were: considering France's determination to freely resolve the Indochina War if possible, and exchanging views on the deadlock in negotiations with the Communists regarding the convening of a Korean peace conference."

### 在百慕大会议上美英法三国有很大分歧

    在百慕大会议上美英法三国有很大分歧
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社讯：美英法三国会议于四日在百慕大举行。据资产阶级通讯社与报刊报道，会议首先就答覆苏联照会问题以及“欧洲防务集团”问题进行了讨论。
    据美联社驻百慕大记者报道，三国外长虽然初步准备接受苏联提出的在柏林召开四国外长会议的建议，但是他们之间对召开会议的时间发生了分歧。法新社和“星期晚报”从百慕大发出的消息，也证明在答覆苏联照会的问题上，百慕大会议的参加者之间存在着严重的分歧。法新社记者报道，美国代表要求为即将在柏林举行的四大国外长会议规定一个限期，但英国和法国的代表表示反对。法新社记者接着说：“西方国家在草拟复照的问题上，比预料中的困难还要大得多。复照是否能由百慕大发往莫斯科，美国代表对此表示怀疑。”“星期晚报”记者报道：三国会议“在答覆关于苏联建议在柏林召开四大国会议的问题上发生了分歧……在西方对苏联的复照问题上，据说英国和法国希望打开大门来讨论苏联关于召开五大国会议的建议，而美国的态度却是非常不可调和的。”
    在“欧洲防务集团”问题上，美联社驻百慕大记者指出，美国反对“任何拖延”，企图竭力在目前情况下迫使法国加速批准“欧洲防务集团”（欧洲军）的计划。据美联社记者报道，艾森豪威尔、邱吉尔和皮杜尔在五日举行会议以后，发表公报如下：“各代表团团长在外长伴随之下，今天下午继续举行会议。他们在讨论了对苏联照会的答覆后，开始就欧洲防务集团问题初步交换了意见。”但美联社记者接着指出，“各代表团团长”这一说法，实际上是不正确的；因为法国声明，拉尼埃并没有出席这次会议，而是由皮杜尔代替他出席的。拉尼埃总理的“缺席，引起了人们对他的注意”。记者写道：“会场以外盛传拉尼埃竭力想摆脱欧洲军问题的内部政治斗争，因为他希望当选为法国总统。”合众社驻百慕大记者猜测，拉尼埃的病可能是一种“外交手段”，并说：“许多人认为，因为总理对法国总统竞选很感兴趣，所以不得不小心翼翼，不敢以任何形式干预关于欧洲军问题的讨论。”
    据美联社驻百慕大记者报道，官方代表对大会工作“完全保守秘密”。路透社驻纽约记者写道：
  “纽约先驱论坛报”社论说，百慕大会议表现出可能引起激烈的分歧。每个国家都准备提出自己喜爱的方案。
    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社纽约七日讯：据各通讯社记者自百慕大发出的消息：美、英、法政府首脑六日举行会议。和五日一样，法国总理拉尼埃没有出席这个会议。三国外长同时举行了会议。
    会后，邱吉尔和艾森豪威尔发表公报如下：
    “三国政府的首脑及其外交部长继续讨论了欧洲问题，明天将转而讨论远东问题。法国外交部长皮杜尔在政府首脑会议上就法国对欧洲防务集团问题的态度作了说明。”
    合众社记者写道：“由于抱怨第一次会议后‘走漏’了消息，美、英、法三国代表曾作了‘保持缄默的约定’，在这之后他们就谨言慎行起来了。”
    从新闻报道中可以看出：六日的会议上也讨论了远东问题，在会议过程中，会议参加者之间发生了分歧。例如，美联社记者指出：“在今天（即六日）的会议的议程上，另外一项是就亚洲地区的局势交换意见。在这个问题上，西方三国的分歧最大。……据权威人士说，邱吉尔告诉艾森豪威尔，英国认为，跟俄国和中国进行贸易，对于英国的利益是极端重要的。……今天会议情况是严格保密的，今天会议的另外一些议程是：考虑法国决心在可能的情况下自由地解决印度支那战争的问题，并对于与共方进行的关于召开朝鲜和平会议的谈判的僵局交换意见。”
