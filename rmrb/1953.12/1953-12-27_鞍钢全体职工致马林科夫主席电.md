    To Comrade Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Socialist Republics:
    As the three projects of Anshan Iron and Steel Company – the seamless steel tube plant, the large rolling mill, and the No. 7 blast furnace – are successively completed and put into production, all the staff of Anshan Iron and Steel Company express their heartfelt gratitude for the assistance given by the great Soviet Union. The completion of the three Anshan projects is a great achievement in the first year of our country's implementation of the First Five-Year Plan and is of great significance for our country's socialist industrialization. This achievement is inseparable from the assistance of the Soviet Union. In these three projects, from the collection of basic design data, the determination of design tasks, the design, construction, installation, and commissioning, to the trial production of new products, the provision of technical data for new products, and so on, the Soviet government has given us the greatest help. The Soviet expert comrades not only directly helped us complete the tasks of basic construction but also helped us train technical personnel for basic construction. Therefore, it is no exaggeration to say that these three projects are the crystallization of the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union.
    Following the teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong, in the long-term construction in the future, we must work harder to learn from the advanced experience and the latest technology of the Soviet Union, strive to gradually realize our country's socialist industrialization, and strive to further strengthen the strength of the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union.
    Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people!
    All staff of Anshan Iron and Steel Company

    鞍钢全体职工致马林科夫主席电苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟部长会议主席马林科夫同志：
    当鞍山钢铁公司的三项工程——无缝钢管厂、大型轧钢厂、第七号炼铁炉，都相继竣工并开始生产之际，鞍山钢铁公司全体职工对伟大的苏联给予我们的援助，表示衷心的感谢。鞍山三项工程的竣工，是我国在实行第一个五年计划的第一年当中所获得的巨大成就，对于我国社会主义工业化有重要意义。这个成就是和苏联的援助分不开的。在这三项工程中，从搜集设计基础资料、确定设计任务书、进行设计、建筑安装和开工运转，一直到新产品试制，供给新产品的技术资料等等，苏联政府都给了我们最大的帮助。苏联政府所派来的专家同志们不但直接帮助我们完成了基本建设的任务，并且还帮助我们培养了基本建设的技术人材。因此，这三项工程可以毫不夸张地说是中苏两国伟大友谊的结晶。
    遵照毛泽东同志的教导，在今后长期建设当中，我们一定要更加努力学习苏联的先进经验和最新技术，为逐步实现我国的社会主义工业化而奋斗，为更加壮大以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的力量而奋斗。
    中苏两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    鞍山钢铁公司全体职工
    一九五三年十二月二十六日
