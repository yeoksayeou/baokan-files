By helping farmers carefully calculate their accounts, the Houyingzi Village Branch of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in the suburbs of Baotou City, Suiyuan Province, under the assistance of the CPC Baotou City Suburban Committee Working Group, led all villagers in studying the general line and general tasks of the state during the transition period. The patriotic enthusiasm of the villagers soared, and they sold all of their surplus grain, amounting to more than 129,000 jin, to the state.

In order to enable the farmers to deeply understand the state's general line during the transition period based on their personal experience, the CPC Baotou City Suburban Committee Working Group and the Houyingzi Village Branch helped the farmers calculate several detailed accounts. First, they helped the farmers summarize the economic changes in the village before and after liberation, guiding them to recall and compare their living conditions before and after liberation. Before liberation, the village only had 117 draught animals (only 9 of which were mules and horses) and 46 iron carts. The grain farmers harvested each year was barely enough after paying rent to the landlords and various exorbitant taxes. At that time, the farmers lived in extreme poverty. After liberation, through the land reform movement and the implementation of mutual aid and cooperation, the yield per unit area was increased, the means of production increased, and living standards improved. Now, the village has a total of 132 draught animals, an increase of more than 12% compared to before liberation; there are now 107 iron carts, an increase of more than 130% compared to before liberation. With the improvement of living standards, more than 90% of school-age children in the village are now enrolled in school. When analyzing the source of these benefits, the masses concluded that: this is all the result of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao leading us in implementing the general line.

In order to enable the farmers to further understand the benefits of national industrialization for the farmers, the District Committee Working Group and the Party Branch also led everyone in calculating detailed accounts in terms of changes in the prices of industrial and agricultural products. For example, last year, one dan of millet sold for 143,200 yuan. At that time, buying one chi of white cloth cost 3,200 yuan, and one dan of millet could only be exchanged for more than 4 zhang and 4 chi of cloth. This year, the price of one dan of millet has increased to 148,200 yuan, and the price of white cloth has fallen to 2,900 yuan per chi, so one dan of millet can be exchanged for more than 5 zhang and 1 chi of white cloth, which is more than 6 chi of cloth than last year. After such a calculation, everyone realized that these were all benefits brought to the farmers by the country's industrial development, so they expressed their willingness to sell their surplus grain to the state to support national industrial construction.

Next, the District Committee Working Group and the Party Branch used specific examples from the village to educate the masses, reversing the masses' mistaken idea that "burying grain in the cellar is like putting it in a safe." Farmers have been actively preparing to sell surplus grain to expand production next year. The villagers sold a total of more than 129,000 jin of surplus grain to the state.

    通过算细账认清把余粮卖给国家的好处
    包头市郊后营子村农民卖粮近十三万斤
    中共绥远省包头市郊区后营子村支部，在中共包头市郊区委员会工作组的帮助下，用帮助农民算细账的办法，领导全村农民学习了国家过渡时期的总路线和总任务，全村农民爱国热情高涨，把十二万九千多斤余粮全部卖给了国家。
    中共包头市郊区委员会工作组和后营子村支部，为了使农民从切身体验出发深刻地了解国家在过渡时期的总路线，帮助农民算了几笔细账。首先，他们帮助农民总结了该村解放前后经济变化的情况，引导农民回忆和对比了解放以前和现在的生活状况。该村在解放前只有耕畜一百一十七头（其中骡、马仅有九头）、铁车四十六辆，农民每年收下的粮食除给地主交租和出各种苛捐杂税外，所剩无几，当时农民的生活极端贫困。解放后，经过土地改革运动，实行互助合作，提高了单位面积产量，生产资料增加，生活有了改善。现在全村共有耕畜一百三十二头，比解放前增加了百分之十二强；铁车现有一百零七辆，比解放前增加了百分之一百三十多。随着生活的提高，现在全村百分之九十以上的学龄儿童都入了学。当分析这些好处的来源时，群众总结说：这都是共产党、毛主席领导我们贯彻总路线的结果。
    为了使农民进一步认识国家工业化对农民的好处，区委工作组和党支部又领导大家在工农业产品价格的变化方面算了细账。如去年一石谷子卖十四万三千二百元，当时买一尺白市布要三千二百元，一石谷子只能换四丈四尺多布；今年一石谷子的价钱提高到十四万八千二百元，白市布的价格每尺落到二千九百元，一石谷子可换白市布五丈一尺多，比去年能多换六尺多布。这样一算，大家认识到这都是国家发展工业带给农民的好处，因此纷纷表示要把余粮卖给国家，支持国家工业建设。
    接着，区委工作组和党支部又运用该村具体事例，对群众进行了教育，扭转了群众认为“把粮食埋在窖里如同入了保险柜”的错误思想。农民纷纷准备出卖余粮扩大明年大生产。全村农民共计卖给国家十二万九千多斤余粮。
