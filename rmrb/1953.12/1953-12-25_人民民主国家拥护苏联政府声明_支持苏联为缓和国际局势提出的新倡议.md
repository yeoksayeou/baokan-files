Xinhua News Agency, December 24th: Newspapers in People's Democratic countries widely welcomed the Soviet government's statement on Eisenhower's speech on atomic weapons.

According to TASS: The Polish "People's Tribune" wrote in its editorial: The Soviet government, loyal to its consistent policy, proposes that all countries undertake the solemn and unconditional obligation to prohibit the use of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction. World opinion welcomes the Soviet government's statement with great attention and sympathy. Therefore, there is a right to expect that this statement will also receive due understanding among the ruling circles of the United States. Whether a satisfactory agreement can be reached on the issue of atomic energy, which is of the utmost importance to the cause of peace, will depend on the ruling circles of the United States, and on whether they are sincere.

The Romanian "Spark" wrote in its editorial: Hundreds of millions of people in all countries of the world welcome this very important document with great interest. Every line of this statement expresses the Soviet government's profound and practical concern to liberate mankind from the nightmare of atomic war.

The Hungarian "Free People's Daily" wrote: In the Soviet government's statement, there is a sense of responsibility for the fate of mankind, and a lofty will to protect mankind from the disasters of atomic war and hydrogen weapon war. The Soviet government's proposal reflects the vital interests of the people of all countries in the world. The people believe that the Soviet government's statement is a new step taken to prevent atomic war and to use atomic energy for peaceful purposes.

The Czechoslovak "Red Rights" wrote in its editorial: The Soviet government's proposal to immediately reach an international agreement on the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction is fully in line with the wishes of the people of the countries of the peace camp. The people of Czechoslovakia, like the people of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, are full of determination to do their utmost to eliminate the threat of atomic weapons, to ease international tensions and to consolidate lasting peace.

Commenting on the Soviet government's statement, the Bulgarian "Workers' Cause" said: The Bulgarian people fully support the great contribution made by the Soviet Union once again in the cause of the struggle for peace, and fully support the Soviet Union's determination to try its best to prevent atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons from being used against mankind.

    支持苏联为缓和国际局势提出的新倡议
    【新华社二十四日讯】人民民主国家报纸广泛欢迎苏联政府就艾森豪威尔关于原子武器的演说发表的声明。
    据塔斯社讯：波兰“人民论坛报”在社论中写道：苏联政府忠于自己的一贯政策，建议各国承担起禁止使用原子武器、氢武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器的庄严的、无条件的义务。世界舆论以极大的注意和同情欢迎苏联政府的声明。因此有权利期待，这一声明也同样会在美国统治集团中得到应有的理解。将来是否能在这一对和平事业具有最重大意义的问题——原子能问题上达成令人满意的协议，这要看美国统治集团，看他们是否具有诚意。
    罗马尼亚“火花报”在社论中写道：世界各国千千万万人们怀着莫大的兴趣欢迎这个非常重要的文件。这个声明的每一行都表现出苏联政府从原子战争的噩梦中解放人类的深刻的和实际的关怀。
    匈牙利“自由人民报”写道：在苏联政府的声明中，充满对人类的命运的责任感，和保卫人类免受原子战争和氢武器战争的灾祸这样一种崇高的意志。苏联政府的建议反映了全世界各国人民的切身利益。人民认为苏联政府的声明是为了防止原子战争、把原子能用之于和平目的而采取的新步骤。
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”在社论中写道：苏联政府建议立即就禁止大规模毁灭性的武器的问题达成国际协议，是完全符合和平阵营各国人民的愿望的。捷克斯洛伐克人民同苏联及其他人民民主国家的人民一样，充满着决心，尽力为消除原子武器威胁、为缓和国际紧张局势和巩固持久和平而努力。
    保加利亚“工人事业报”评论苏联政府的声明说：保加利亚人民完全拥护苏联又一次在和平斗争事业中作出的伟大贡献，完全支持苏联尽力设法不使原子武器和氢武器被用来反对人类的决心。
    苏联政府的声明成为德意志民主共和国社会各界注意的中心。柏林许多民主报纸十二月二十三日评论苏联政府的声明，把这个声明看作是旨在缓和国际紧张局势的新倡议。
    阿尔巴尼亚和蒙古各报在十二月二十三日都刊载了苏联政府声明的全文。
