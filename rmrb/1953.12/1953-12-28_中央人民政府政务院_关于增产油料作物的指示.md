Instructions of the State Administrative Council of the Central People's Government on Increasing the Production of Oil Crops
(Passed at the 198th meeting of the State Administrative Council on December 17, 1953)

    The basic situation of edible oil supply at present is that there is an imbalance between production and sales, and production cannot keep up with demand. On the one hand, in the recovery and development of the entire national economy, the recovery speed of oil crop production is slow, and the output is only 70% to 80% of that before the Anti-Japanese War, lagging behind the pre-war level. On the other hand, since the production of industrial products, grain, cotton and other agricultural products has generally exceeded the pre-war level, and people's living standards have been continuously improved, the consumption of edible oil has been increasing day by day, resulting in a phenomenon of supply falling short of demand. In recent years, it was right to concentrate efforts on increasing the production of grain and cotton; however, it was not right to not pay enough attention to the increase in production of oil crops, to lack a comprehensive analysis of the false phenomenon of oversupply of oil crops in some areas, and to fail to solve the problems existing in oil crop prices and procurement work in a timely manner, and must be changed.
    There are many kinds of edible vegetable oils in our country, mainly including soybeans, peanuts, rapeseed, tea seed, cottonseed, sesame, coconut, flax, sunflower seeds, etc. The fundamental way to solve the difficulty of edible oil supply is to increase the output of oil crops. From now on, all localities must strengthen the leadership in increasing the production of oil crops to ensure an appropriate supply of oil and to meet the needs of the people's continuously improving living standards. For this reason, the following instructions are hereby given:
    (1) Leading farmers to cultivate meticulously and improve the yield per unit area is the central link in increasing the production of oil crops at present. All localities must pay close attention to summarizing the local farmers' experience in high-yield oil crops and appropriately promote it. For the phenomenon that some farmers believe that oil crops are "by-products" and "lazy crops," and therefore cultivate coarsely, do not pay attention to seed selection, and are unwilling to apply fertilizer, education and persuasion should be strengthened to promote their improvement. Experience from various places has proved that whether it is soybeans, peanuts, or rapeseed, the yield can be greatly increased once appropriate fertilization is applied. Although rapeseed has been sown this year, the masses should still be universally mobilized to apply topdressing fertilizer and do a good job in cultivating and draining water, and strive to increase the output of rapeseed in 1954. For oil crops such as peanuts and soybeans to be sown in 1954, in addition to paying attention to fertilization and the selection of fine seeds, it is necessary to ensure full seedlings and do a good job in cultivating. In areas where conditions permit, key promotion of rhizobium inoculation can be carried out to increase yields. Technical extension stations in oil crop planting areas should strengthen technical guidance on oil crop production, and agricultural experiment stations should also actively engage in experimental research on oil crop planting.
    (2) On the premise of not affecting grain production, the cultivated area of oil crops should be appropriately expanded. The planting area of soybeans should be stabilized at the 1953 planting area, and appropriate development should also be carried out in areas where land can be reclaimed, such as northern Manchuria. In some areas in the north, soybeans can be intercropped with corn and sorghum, and in the south, mountains and field ridges can also be used to plant soybeans to rationally utilize land fertility. Peanuts have a high yield per unit area, a high oil content, and are suitable for growing on relatively barren sandy soils. There is still a lot of unused sandy wasteland in various places, which can be fully used to plant peanuts. Provinces such as Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Shaanxi can appropriately allocate some sandy land that grows miscellaneous grains and beans with very low yields to grow peanuts to expand the planting area of peanuts. In some areas in the south that are not suitable for growing winter wheat, and in areas where there is a surplus of grain that is difficult to transport, the planting area of rapeseed can be appropriately expanded. Because sesame needs to be rotated, except for large-scale planting in provinces such as Hubei, Henan, and Anhui, other areas mostly plant sporadically. In 1954, the sesame planting area in key provinces and regions should maintain the level of 1953. In addition, flax and large and small hemp seeds can be appropriately developed by using the edges of fields and ridges according to local conditions, and saline-alkali land and domestic house gap land that are not suitable for grain production should be used as much as possible to expand the planting of sunflower seeds.
    (3) Tea oil trees, pepper trees, walnut trees, and coconut trees on Hainan Island are suitable for growing on hillsides. These woody oil crops not only do not compete with grain for land, but also play a role in protecting mountains and maintaining water and soil. They can be greatly developed. Various oil crops in mountainous areas should also be developed in many ways in accordance with local conditions to cooperate with long-term construction in mountainous areas, increase the income of farmers in mountainous areas, and expand oil sources.
    (4) The leading organs of major regions and provinces should actively lead the agricultural departments to formulate plans for increasing the production of oil crops in their respective regions and provinces, and the provinces should determine key counties for developing oil crops. The key counties for developing oil crops should also formulate their own production increase plans based on the specific conditions of districts and townships. The above plans should be summarized by the major regions and reported to the State Planning Commission, the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Administrative Council, and the Central Ministry of Agriculture by the end of the first quarter of 1954.
    (5) Planting oil crops requires a lot of investment, and the head office of the People's Bank of China and its branches in various places should pay attention to this when allocating agricultural loans. For example, in areas where peanut cultivation is expanded, because more seeds are needed and the cost is higher, loans for peanut seeds can be appropriately issued to provide assistance. State-owned commercial departments and cooperatives should promote pre-purchase contracts, do a good job in purchasing, and ensure reasonable purchase prices; in some places, oil prices are too low, and the Central Ministry of Commerce should make appropriate adjustments to increase farmers' enthusiasm for increasing oil crop production.
    (6) Increasing the production of oil crops, like increasing the production of other agricultural products, must actively develop mutual assistance and cooperation, because the possibility of increasing production for individual farmers is limited, while agricultural production cooperatives and well-established mutual aid groups can more rationally use labor, more effectively use the edges of fields, ridges, sandy soils, and barren mountainous areas, and develop the production of oil crops. However, individual farmers still account for the majority of the total number of farmers in the country, so the possibility of individual farmers increasing the production of oil crops must also be fully exploited and not be ignored.
    The phenomenon of supply falling short of demand for edible oil is a long-term problem. Therefore, the leading organs and agricultural departments of governments at all levels in various places must pay sufficient attention to increasing oil production. In particular, key provinces and counties that produce oil must devote efforts to earnestly do a good job in increasing oil crop production and strive for a balance between oil supply and demand under the general requirement of the state's planned increase in grain and various economic crops.

    中央人民政府政务院
    关于增产油料作物的指示
    （一九五三年十二月十七日政务院第一百九十八次政务会议通过）
    目前食油供应的基本情况，是产销之间存在着不平衡，生产赶不上需要。一方面，在整个国民经济的恢复和发展中，油料作物生产恢复的速度较慢，产量仅当抗日战争前的百分之七十至八十，落后于战前水平。而另一方面，由于工业生产和粮食、棉花及其他各项农产品的生产一般均已超过战前水平，人民生活不断提高，食油的消费量日益增加，因而就出现了食油供不应求的现象。几年来集中力量于粮食与棉花的增产，这是对的；但对于油料作物的增产重视不够，对某些地区一度发生油料滞销的虚假过剩现象缺乏全面的分析，对油料价格及收购工作中存在着的问题未能及时解决，则是不对的，必须加以改变。
    我国可供食用的植物油料，种类很多，主要有大豆、花生、菜籽、茶籽、棉籽、芝麻、椰子、胡麻、葵花子等等，解决食油供应困难的根本办法主要是增加油料作物的产量，从现在起各地必须加强对油料作物增产的领导，以保证油料的适当供应，保证人民生活不断提高的需要。为此，特作如下指示：
    （一）领导农民精耕细作，提高单位面积产量，是当前油料作物增产的中心环节。各地必须切实注意总结当地农民对油料作物的丰产经验，适当地加以推广。对于有一部分农民认为油料作物是“副产物”是“懒庄稼”，因而耕作粗糙、不注意选种、不愿施肥的现象，应加强教育说服工作，促其改进。从各地经验证明，无论大豆、花生、油菜一经适当施肥，产量就可大大提高。今年油菜虽已播种，仍应普遍发动群众施用追肥，作好中耕排水工作，争取一九五四年菜籽产量的提高。对于一九五四年播种的花生、大豆等油料作物，除注意施肥与选用良种外，要保证全苗，作好中耕，在有条件地区，可重点推广根瘤菌拌种，以提高产量。油料作物种植地区的技术推广站应加强对油料作物生产的技术指导工作，农事试验场亦应积极从事油料作物种植的试验研究工作。
      （二）在不影响粮食增产的前提下，适当地扩大油料作物的栽培面积。大豆应稳定在一九五三年的种植面积，北满等有条件垦荒的地区还应适当发展。在北方某些地区大豆可与玉米、高粱间作，在南方亦可利用山地及田埂种植大豆，合理地利用地力。花生单位产量高，含油率大，并适宜于比较瘠薄的砂质土壤上生长，各地未利用的砂荒地尚多，可充分用以种植花生，河北、山东、河南、江苏、湖北、两广、四川、陕西等省，有些种杂粮、豆子而产量很低的砂地可适当匀出一部改种花生，以扩大花生的播种面积。在南方某些不适宜种冬麦的地区，以及粮食有余而难以调运出来的地区可适当扩大油菜籽的播种面积。芝麻因需换茬轮作，除湖北、河南、安徽等省有大片种植外，其他地区则多零星种植，一九五四年重点省区芝麻种植面积要保持一九五三年的水平。此外，还可根据当地情况利用地边田埂适当发展胡麻和大、小麻子，而尽量利用不适宜于粮食生产的盐碱地和农家屋旁隙地，扩大种植葵花子。
    （三）茶油树、花椒树、核桃树及海南岛的椰子树等，适于山坡生长，这些木本油料作物不但不与粮食争地，而且能起到保护山地，保持水土的作用，可大大发展。并应因地制宜地多方面发展山区的各种油料作物，以配合山区长期建设，增加山区农民收入，扩大油料来源。
      （四）各大区和省的领导机关应积极领导农业部门订出本区本省增产油料作物的计划，并由省确定发展油料作物的重点县，发展油料作物的重点县亦应根据区乡具体情况订出本县的增产计划。上述计划应由各大区汇总于一九五四年第一季度末上报国家计划委员会、政务院财政经济委员会和中央农业部。
      （五）种植油料作物，有的需要较多的投资，人民银行总行和各地分支机构在分配农业贷款时均应注意及此。例如，在扩大花生栽培的地区，因需种籽较多，成本较高，可适当地发放一部花生种籽的贷款，加以扶助。国营商业部门及合作社应推行预购合同，做好收购工作，保证合理的收购价格；有的地方油料价格偏低，中央商业部应作适当调整，以提高农民对增产油料作物的积极性。
    （六）增产油料作物，也和增产其他农产品一样，必须积极发展互助合作，因为个体农民增产的可能性是有限的，而农业生产合作社和较有基础的互助组则可以更合理地使用劳动力，更有效地利用地边、田埂、砂质土壤和瘠薄的山地，发展油料作物的生产。但目前个体农民在全国农户总数中还是占优势的，因此，对个体农民增产油料作物的可能性，同样必须充分发挥，不容忽视。
    食油供不应求的现象，是一个较长时期的问题。因此，各地领导机关及各级政府的农业部门对油料增产必须有足够的重视，尤其是各生产油料的重点省县要拿出力量，认真地作好油料作物的增产工作，在实现国家有计划地增加粮食及各种经济作物的总要求下，为争取油料供需平衡而努力。
