About two million people have received the education of this propaganda. At present, the propaganda and education work of the general line is being carried out in depth in Shanghai.

The responsible cadres of each unit also conveyed the above reports to the Party members, cadres, and workers of their respective units. Subsequently, the work of vigorously publicizing the general line to the broad masses of people was widely launched in various districts of the city. More than 1,000 reporters were dispatched from various districts alone. According to incomplete statistics, by the end of November, more than 790,000 people in the city had received this education.
    In Nanjing, from mid-November, responsible cadres of Party and government organs and more than 500 reporters went to report on the general line to the cadres of organs and people from all walks of life in the city. The number of people who heard the reports has reached more than 500,000.

All the workers of the Nanjing Chemical Plant have listened to one to three reports and conducted three discussions. Every evening, the residents' reading groups in the city are crowded with people, studying and discussing the general line. After listening to the reports, grassroots cadres and activists among the residents are launching extensive publicity to the surrounding masses. The Propaganda Department of the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the CPC convened a propaganda meeting on December 2nd, and decided to carry out three more large-scale propaganda activities from now until the Spring Festival.
    Around November 28th, Jinan dispatched more than 650 reporters to report on the general line and general tasks of the state during the transition period to the workers and staff of factories and enterprises, street residents, and teachers and students of schools in Jinan, so as to raise the socialist and patriotic ideological awareness of the masses.

According to preliminary statistics, as of the end of November, nearly 40,000 people in the city have heard the conveyed reports.
    In Xi'an, as of December 2nd, 80,000 people have been educated. More than 14,000 cadres in the city who participated in the political theory study of high, middle, and junior groups have successively turned to the study of the general line in mid-to-late November. From November 2nd to 30th, Fang Zhongru, Second Secretary of the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the CPC, Dong Xueyuan, Deputy Secretary, and other responsible cadres made reports on the general line to cadres of various organs and people from all walks of life in the city. On November 27th, the Northwest General Branch and the Xi'an Branch of the China Democratic League jointly held a committee meeting. At the meeting, Yang Mingxuan, Chairman of the General Branch, made a mobilization report on studying the general line.
    In Lanzhou, about 100,000 people have received education on the general line so far. On November 13th and 14th, Zhang Desheng, Secretary of the Gansu Provincial Committee of the CPC, made a report on the general line to more than 15,000 cadres and students of various organs in the city. On November 28th, 28 reporters at the Gansu provincial level made reports to workers, teachers, students, democratic personages, and industrialists and businessmen in Lanzhou. From December 1st, the Lanzhou Municipal Committee of the CPC organized another 37 reporters to universally conduct propaganda on the general line to the residents of the city. The Gansu People's Broadcasting Station has added special broadcasting programs on the general line from December 1st. In addition, Lanzhou organized three film teams and a group of folk artists to prepare to go to the suburbs for screenings and performances. The picture exhibition group organized by the Gansu Provincial Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and other units has carried pictures to exhibit in the suburbs of Lanzhou to educate the suburban peasants on the socialist future.
    After the propaganda work on the general line in Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, Zhangjiakou, Baoding, Qinhuangdao, Xuanhua and other cities began in early November, it was first launched among cadres above the grassroots level, Party members, League members, and activists in various factories, mines, streets, organs, schools, and industrial and commercial circles, and medical circles. From late November, they gradually went deep into the masses in factories, mines, streets, and suburbs. By the end of November, according to preliminary statistics from Kailuan Coal Mine, Tangshan Steel Plant, Tangshan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Plant, Tangshan Power Plant and other factories and mines in Tangshan, 70,000 workers had been educated on the general line; 100,000 people in Zhangjiakou had heard one to three reports on the general line; 140,000 people in Shijiazhuang had heard the reports; and 20,000 people in Qinhuangdao and Xuanhua had received the education on the general line. The CPC committees of the above-mentioned cities all attached great importance to the propaganda work of the general line. In addition to formulating propaganda plans and cadre study plans for the general line, the responsible persons of the CPC committees of each city also made reports on the general line to the cadres of each city. The Zhangjiakou Municipal Committee of the CPC sent more than 1,000 cadres to the city to publicize the general line. The Baoding Municipal Committee of the CPC sent 68 reporters and 450 propagandists. The Qinhuangdao Municipal Committee of the CPC concentrated 2,748 propagandists to study the general line.
    After being educated on the general line, the broad masses of the people were all jubilant and felt that "the goal of struggle is clearer" and "the heart is brighter," which greatly improved the enthusiasm for production and work. After listening to the report on the industrialization of the country, the workers of the printing and dyeing workshop of the State-owned Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory created a new record in terms of output and quality in October in the past four years; and production in November was further improved. The coil production of the No. 2 Plant of Shanghai Iron and Steel Company also created a new record in mid-November. After discussing the general line, the workers of the medium-sized rolling mill workshop of the No. 1 Branch of the State-owned Tianjin Steel Plant realized the importance of developing heavy industry, and their labor enthusiasm was even higher, and they repeatedly created new records in rolling steel. After listening to the report, Yun Chunhua, a worker of the Repair and Manufacturing Plant of the Tram Company of the Public Utilities Bureau of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government, worked late into the night and designed a drawing, and put forward a rationalization proposal for an important improved tool. Wang Chengjiang, a weaving worker of the joint public-private Da Fu Weaving and Dyeing Company, said: "Now I know that the factory has been changed to a joint public-private enterprise, which is one step closer to socialism." From then on, his production enthusiasm was even greater. He has increased from weaving 37 yards of cloth per day to 42 yards, and the rate of positive cloth has reached 95%. After studying the general line, the workers of the nitration workshop of Nanjing Chemical Plant completed the monthly production plan seven days ahead of schedule in November. Worker Zhao Guangde is planning to change some manual labor operations to automation. After listening to the report on the general line, the employees of the Guye Refractory Materials Department of the State-owned Tangshan Steel Plant said that on the basis of completing the annual production plan 43 days ahead of schedule, they will continue to work hard and strive to complete the plan to increase production and practice economy of 4.67 billion yuan ahead of schedule. All enterprises in Zhangjiakou checked the implementation of the national production plan according to the general line and put forward improvement methods. For example, the workers of the Prospecting Machinery Factory actively tried to improve production, and eight groups completed the November production plan five days ahead of schedule. After listening to the report on the general line, Wu Shoude, a worker in the cutting and assembling workshop of Qinhuangdao Yaohua Glass Factory, said during the discussion: "If we cut one more piece of glass, we will add one more share of wealth to the country."
