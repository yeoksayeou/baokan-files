Xinhua News Agency, December 16th: The "People's Republic of Bulgaria Film Week," which began on the 5th and was held in twenty major cities across our nation, has now concluded. This was the first time Bulgarian films were shown to a wide audience in our country. Because these films used high artistry to depict the patriotic spirit of the Bulgarian people actively participating in the liberation of their motherland and the construction of socialism, they were greatly welcomed throughout our country.

During the Film Week, Beijing, Tianjin, and Taiyuan showed a total of 371 screenings, with an audience of over 242,000 people; Shenyang, Anshan, Harbin, Lüda, and Changchun presented a total of 615 screenings, with an audience of over 490,000 people; Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hangzhou held a total of 483 screenings, with an audience of over 499,000 people; Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Changsha held a total of 547 screenings, with an audience of over 445,000 people; Chongqing, Chengdu, and Kunming had an audience of over 468,000 people; Lanzhou held 89 screenings, with an audience of over 47,000 people.

During the Film Week, newspapers in various regions, as well as blackboards in many factories, government offices, schools, and streets, widely published articles introducing Bulgarian films. Many local audiences held discussion sessions after watching the films.

The film "The Morning of the Motherland" screened during the film week aroused love from Chinese young workers and students. Wang Chonglun, a special-class labor model of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, said after watching the film: "The enthusiasm of Bulgarian youth for the construction of their motherland has further inspired my confidence in working hard for the industrialization of my own motherland. I will further complete four years of production tasks in one year on the basis of completing three years of tasks in one year." Students of Nanjing Agricultural College were deeply moved after watching "The Morning of the Motherland" and strengthened their emphasis on production practice. Many students in Beijing and Shanghai, many construction workers and stevedores in Chongqing, were also infected by the Bulgarian youth's love of labor and love of the motherland in "The Morning of the Motherland," and expressed that they would strengthen their study and exercise, and prepare to participate in the construction of the motherland.

The film "Danka" screened during the film week made a particularly deep impression on the working masses in various parts of our country who are now living a happy working life but suffered all kinds of oppression from the reactionaries before liberation. Workers from many factories such as Beijing Auto Parts Factory, Nanjing Match Factory, and Chongqing Yuxin Textile Factory, after watching "Danka," combined their own personal experiences to further realize that only in a country where the working class has seized power can the working people be liberated. They all expressed that they would better complete their production plans to accelerate the socialist industrialization of the country.

"The Alarm" was the most popular film among audiences in cities such as Beijing and Tianjin. The heroic and fearless spirit of the Bulgarian Communists portrayed in the film aroused the admiration of the audience. "Under Oppression," although it was added later and had fewer screenings, also gave Chinese audiences an extremely deep impression of the Bulgarian people's struggle for national liberation in history.

This Film Week deepened the understanding and friendly relations between the broad masses of our people and Bulgaria, and also gave our people another opportunity to learn from the cultural achievements of fraternal countries.

    “保加利亚人民共和国电影周”胜利结束
    我国各地广大观众热烈欢迎放映的影片
    【新华社十六日讯】五日起在我国二十个大城市举行的“保加利亚人民共和国电影周”，已经先后结束。这是保加利亚影片第一次在我国广大观众中放映，由于这些影片以高度的艺术性表现了保加利亚人民积极参加祖国的解放事业和社会主义建设的爱国主义精神，在我国各地受到很大的欢迎。
    在电影周期间，北京、天津、太原共映出三百七十一场，观众达二十四万二千多人次；沈阳、鞍山、哈尔滨、旅大、长春共演出六百一十五场，观众达四十九万多人次；上海、南京、杭州共映出四百八十三场，观众达四十九万九千多人次；武汉、广州、长沙共映出五百四十七场，观众达四十四万五千多人次；重庆、成都、昆明的观众达四十六万八千多人次；兰州映出八十九场，观众四万七千多人次。
    在电影周期间，各地的报纸，以及很多工厂、机关、学校和街道的黑板报上，都广泛登载了介绍保加利亚电影的文章。很多地方的观众在看完电影以后举行了座谈会。
    电影周放映的“祖国的早晨”影片引起了我国青年工人和学生们的热爱。鞍山钢铁公司特等劳动模范王崇伦在看完这部影片后说：“保加利亚青年那种为祖国建设的热情，更鼓舞了我为自己的祖国工业化而努力工作的信心，我要在一年完成三年任务的基础上，再进一步用一年的时间完成四年的生产任务。”南京农学院的学生看过“祖国的早晨”影片以后，很受感动，加强了对生产实习的重视。北京、上海的许多学生，重庆的许多建筑工人和搬运工人也为“祖国的早晨”里保加利亚青年的热爱劳动、热爱祖国的品质所感染、表示要加强学习和锻炼身体，准备参加祖国的建设。
    电影周放映的“妲卡”一片对我国各地现在过着幸福的劳动生活、解放前曾受尽反动派压迫的工人群众印象特别深刻。北京汽车配件厂、南京火柴厂、重庆渝新纺织厂等许多工厂的工人，在看过“妲卡”后，都结合自己的切身经历，进一步认识到只有工人阶级掌握了政权的国家，劳动人民才能得到解放，都表示要更好的完成生产计划，以加速国家的社会主义工业化。
    “警钟”一片，在北京、天津等城市都是最受观众欢迎的，影片中表现的保加利亚共产党员的英勇无畏的精神，引起了观众的敬佩。“在压迫下”一片，虽是后来加映的，放映场数较少，但它所反映的保加利亚人民在历史上所进行的民族解放斗争的事迹，也给了中国观众以极其深刻的印象。
    这次电影周加深了我国广大观众对保加利亚的了解和友谊关系，也给了我国人民又一次向兄弟国家的文化成就学习的机会。
