Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 2nd. Forty-eight state-owned and locally state-owned factories in Shenyang have already exceeded the national production plan for the entire year ahead of schedule. At 5:30 PM on November 30th, the Shenyang Federation of Trade Unions, Shenyang People's Broadcasting Station, and Shenyang Daily jointly held a broadcast meeting. At the meeting, representatives from twenty-six state-owned factories, including metallurgy, water pump, transformer, wire rod, woolen textile, and mining machinery factories, and twenty-two locally state-owned factories, including woodwork, oil felt paper, printing and dyeing, and glass instrument factories, reported their completion of the annual national plan one to two months ahead of schedule to Chairman Mao with victorious and joyful feelings and the determination to strive for greater achievements.

Under the leadership of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the workers and staff of various factories in Shenyang recognized the great significance of the country's realization of socialist industrialization and the importance of completing the national plan, thereby promoting planned management work and improving the production balance rate. Not only has the labor productivity of each factory greatly increased compared to last year, but the profit delivery plan has also been completed relatively well. By the end of November, the average profit delivery of state-owned factories throughout the city had exceeded the national plan by 8.4 percent. This year, the factories have successfully trial-produced hundreds of new products, most of which meet Soviet standards. These include 15,000 kVA and 20,000 kVA large transformers, automated cone crushers, and 64-blade fan air machines. The successful trial production of these products shows the continuous improvement of the technical level of China's machinery manufacturing industry. Many factories have also made new achievements in implementing the recommendations of Soviet experts and learning from advanced Soviet experience, and many advanced production units and advanced individuals have emerged. For example, the Han Shuwen group in the casting workshop of the Shenyang Water Pump Factory applied the advanced experience of sand turning and lost foam casting, and by the end of November, they had completed the working hour quota for April of next year. Chen Huawen, a young lathe operator in the third workshop of the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, applied the Kolesov new tool method, the Silov drilling method, and implemented the process regulations, and by November 15th, he had also completed the working hour quota for February 1955.

The completion of Shenyang's capital construction plan this year has also improved significantly compared to last year. The total construction area of ​​capital construction in the city this year is 1,237,000 square meters. As of November 20th, the overall progress has reached 95.7 percent. By the end of November, the large and small projects started this year had basically been completed (only some projects have not yet been accepted), and basically achieved the requirements of "good, fast, economical and safe."

However, some factories in Shenyang have not yet fully completed the production plan for January to November. To this end, Huang Oudong, secretary of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, called on these factories at the broadcast meeting to catch up quickly, carry out in-depth competitions, promote advanced experience, strengthen weak links, and strive to complete this historically significant annual national plan; factories that have completed the national plan should prevent complacency and continue to work hard to produce and save more wealth for the country.

    沈阳市有四十八个国营和地方国营工厂
    提前超额完成全年国家生产计划
    【新华社沈阳二日电】沈阳市已有四十八个国营和地方国营工厂提前超额完成了全年的国家生产计划。十一月三十日下午五时半，沈阳市工会联合会、沈阳人民广播电台和沈阳日报社联合举办了广播大会。会上，冶炼、水泵、变压器、线材、毛织、矿山机械等二十六个国营工厂和木器、油毡纸、印染、玻璃仪器等二十二个地方国营工厂的代表，以胜利的愉快心情和争取更大成就的决心，把他们提前一个月到两个月完成全年国家计划的情况向毛主席报捷。
    沈阳市各厂职工在中共沈阳市委的领导下，认识了国家实现社会主义工业化的重大意义，认识了完成国家计划的重要性，从而推动了计划管理工作，提高了生产均衡率。各厂不但劳动生产率比去年有很大提高，上缴利润计划也完成得比较好。全市国营工厂到十一月底，上缴利润平均已超过国家计划百分之八点四。今年各厂试制成功的新产品已有数百种之多，产品规格大部合乎苏联标准，其中有一万五千千伏安和二万千伏安大型变压器、自动化圆锥式破碎机和六十四片叶扇气机等。这些产品的试制成功，显示了我国机械制造工业技术水平的不断提高。许多工厂在贯彻执行苏联专家建议和学习苏联先进经验方面，也有了新的成绩，并出现了很多先进生产单位和先进人物。如沈阳水泵厂铸造车间韩述文小组运用翻砂漏模的先进经验，到十一月底已完成了到明年四月份的工时定额。沈阳第一机床厂第三车间的青年车工陈华文，运用科列索夫新车刀法、希洛夫钻法和贯彻执行了工艺规程，到十一月十五日也完成了到一九五五年二月份的工时定额。
    今年沈阳市基本建设计划完成的情况，也比去年有了显著改善。全市今年基本建设的建筑面积共一百二十三万七千多平方公尺，到十一月二十日止，总进度已达到百分之九十五点七；到十一月底，今年先后开工的大小工程已基本上全部竣工（只有部分工程还没有验收），而且基本上达到了“好、快、省和安全”的要求。
    但目前沈阳市仍有一些工厂没有全面完成一到十一月份的生产计划。为此，中共沈阳市委员会书记黄欧东在广播大会上号召这些工厂急起直追，深入开展竞赛，推广先进经验，加强薄弱环节，争取完成今年富有历史意义的全年国家计划；已经完成国家计划的工厂要防止自满情绪，再接再厉地为国家增产节约更多的财富。
