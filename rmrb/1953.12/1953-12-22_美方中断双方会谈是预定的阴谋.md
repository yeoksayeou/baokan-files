    The US representative Dean has completed his "mission" of interrupting the bilateral talks and preventing the political conference from being held, and is now rushing back to Washington to report his success to Dulles. Dean's excuse for fleeing the meeting was that the Korean and Chinese side's accusation that the US side condoned Syngman Rhee's breach of faith and forced detention of more than 27,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war was an insult to the US government, forcing him to interrupt the talks; however, behind his back, Dean gleefully revealed his true intention of fleeing the meeting in Seoul. He repeatedly made arrogant shouts, attempting to interfere with the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, which was completely unrelated to his duties, and even specified the day to stop the explanation work, the day to grant the prisoners of war "civilian status," and the day to dissolve the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. He even openly claimed that he would send US troops to cooperate with the Li-Chiang secret agents to rob the prisoners of war now in Tongchang-ri. These shouts further prove that the real reason for Dean's flight from the meeting was not that the Korean and Chinese representatives accused the US side of breaching faith, but that the US wanted to implement its plan to forcibly detain prisoners of war, intentionally preventing the political conference from being held, in order to avoid the issue of prisoner of war repatriation being brought up for discussion at the political conference. This is clearly another act of bad faith by the US government in violating the Korean Armistice Agreement.
    Delaying and obstructing the convening of the political conference has been a long-planned scheme by the US government. Shortly after the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the US news agency revealed that "many Americans today are prepared to write it off as a failed conference even before the Far East political conference has begun." (United Press International, New York, August 7) Under the pressure of world opinion, the US had to send representatives to Panmunjom to talk with the Korean and Chinese side; but from the first day of the talks, Dean adopted extremely rogue delaying tactics. When the Bermuda Conference ended and the UN General Assembly was about to adjourn, the US news agency publicly publicized that Dulles had instructed Dean to interrupt the talks at any time. After Dean fled the meeting, the US International News Service quoted a so-called "well-informed source" as saying: "The Communist side's accusation of bad faith is 'the last straw that broke the camel's back.'" That is to say, all preparations for the US to interrupt the talks had long been made, and Dean could seize any trivial excuse to realize the US government's predetermined plan.
    However, it was very foolish for Dean to choose the Korean and Chinese side's accusation that the US side condoned Syngman Rhee's forced detention of more than 27,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war as the "last straw" for interrupting the talks. Because the US side's act of bad faith in condoning the Syngman Rhee clique's forced detention of prisoners of war is well known and seen by all. As the Kaesong Observer pointed out in its commentary on December 15, this event had long been "recorded in historical records as an undeniable act of bad faith." Dean actually wanted to seize this obvious matter as an excuse, which made it easier for people to see how unscrupulous he was in order to interrupt the bilateral talks.
    Dean said that the accusation of US bad faith was not true, but Dean never gave any reason to explain why this accusation was not true. He could only repeat the lie that Clark, Harrison, and others had said a thousand times, saying that the prisoners of war were "released" by Syngman Rhee "against" the "wishes" of the United States, and that the United States "knew nothing in advance." This statement itself is an act of bad faith. Did the US really "know nothing in advance"? This is obviously lying face to face. The whole world knows that after the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" was signed on June 8, the puppet National Assembly of Syngman Rhee, the US's running dog, immediately passed a resolution publicly proposing to immediately "release" the prisoners of war. At the same time, Syngman Rhee's lackeys also held "parades" in many cities in South Korea for days. Agence France-Presse reported on June 12: "In today's parade in Seoul, the most common slogan is: 'Release anti-communist prisoners of war'. Earlier, information from South Korean officials suggested that South Korea may immediately release North Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who refuse repatriation." For these facts that the whole world knew at the time, could the US military authorities in South Korea say that they did not know in advance? United Press International revealed in a June 18 dispatch: "General Clark's senior staff had anticipated Syngman Rhee's actions in advance." The "Washington Post" also admitted in its editorial on June 20: "It is hard to imagine that the release of North Korean prisoners of war could have completely surprised the (US) Eighth Army." However, Clark, Harrison, Dean, and others in the US actually wanted to deny that they "knew nothing in advance." Isn't this bad faith?
    Moreover, when US General Harrison signed the "Terms of Reference" agreement, he was representing the so-called "Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command." When Ridgway was the "Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command," he said that the Syngman Rhee puppet army of South Korea was under his jurisdiction. Since then, the US has never denied that the Syngman Rhee army was under the jurisdiction of the so-called United Nations Command. Even the US government said in a note inviting Switzerland to participate in the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on June 10: "The armed forces of South Korea, like the troops of the other fifteen UN member states in Korea, are under the jurisdiction of the United Nations Command." Then, let people look at this clumsy trick: the "Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command" sent his negotiating representative Harrison to sign the "Terms of Reference" agreement in Panmunjom on the one hand, but on the other hand allowed the Syngman Rhee army under his jurisdiction to tear up this agreement in Pusan. And Dean and others actually said that the US had no responsibility or knowledge of this. Isn't this a typical act of bad faith?
    Countless facts show that the act of bad faith in forcibly detaining more than 27,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war this June was not only known to the US in advance, but was a conspiracy between the US military and the Syngman Rhee gang. According to the US government's note mentioned above on June 10, the prisoners of war "are detained by the United Nations Command, and only the United Nations Command is responsible for all prisoner of war control and guard work." On June 18, the Associated Press revealed that the "camp commanders" of the US prisoner of war camps in South Korea were all Americans, and the guards were US troops and South Korean puppet troops, and the South Korean puppet troops "worked under the supervision of US personnel." In such a prisoner of war camp, without the collusion of the US "camp commanders" and the US guard forces, could the Syngman Rhee puppet army pass unhindered to "release" thousands of prisoners of war? Moreover, the forced detention of these more than 27,000 prisoners of war did not happen in one day, but was completed in many consecutive days. Even after Harrison had written to General Nam Il, claiming that the US military had "replaced" the Li puppet army guarding the prisoners of war "with US troops," the US continued to "release" more than 2,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. Isn't this ironclad proof that the act of bad faith in robbing prisoners of war was a conspiracy between the US and Li? The series of acts of bad faith taken by the US after the incident further proves the conspiratorial nature of this incident. Everyone remembers that in order to escape the condemnation of world opinion, the US hurriedly asked Harrison to write a letter to General Nam Il on June 18, claiming that the US was "trying its best to recover the prisoners of war who are now at large." However, what the US did completely abandoned this promise. The US not only did not take any effective action to be responsible for recovering the "prisoners of war at large," but also publicly protected Syngman Rhee's actions to forcibly detain prisoners of war. The US International News Service revealed on June 19 that a senior spokesman for the US prisoner of war camp command said: The US Far East Command "has been notified not to order in-depth search (i.e., be responsible for recovering prisoners of war) movement." This news agency revealed that the Li Syngman bandit army openly escorted batches of prisoners of war through the streets of Pusan, "but the US military police were ordered not to interfere with any escaped prisoners of war." Isn't this a pre-planned conspiracy? The US had no intention of fulfilling the promise made by its representative Harrison to General Nam Il. Isn't this an act of bad faith?
    The nature of the US side's serious incident of bad faith in forcibly detaining more than 27,000 prisoners of war cannot be denied by Dean and others. Even Reuters reported on June 24 that the British "Daily Herald" commented on this incident: "As Sir Winston Churchill said, this arrogant and treacherous action raises a simple and very important question for us: Who is responsible for controlling South Korea?" The US's so-called "allies" said so. Why didn't the US dare to refute it at all? Why didn't the US say it was an insult to it?
    However, now when the US wanted to interrupt the bilateral talks according to its predetermined steps, Dean hurriedly seized on the Korean and Chinese side's statement accusing the US of bad faith in forcibly detaining more than 27,000 prisoners of war, crying with a mournful face that this was some kind of "insult" to the United States, and disregarded everything to use this as an excuse to interrupt the bilateral talks. The US side was so eager to pick a quarrel to interrupt the bilateral talks that even some of the accomplice countries in the invasion of Korea felt uneasy, thinking that "Dean did not choose an appropriate issue to make a showdown." This completely exposed that the US side's interruption of the bilateral talks was a pre-planned conspiracy.

    美方中断双方会谈是预定的阴谋
    李高
    美国代表迪安完成了中断双方会谈、使政治会议不得召开的“任务”之后，现在急忙回华盛顿向杜勒斯报功去了。迪安逃会的藉口，是说朝中方面指责美方纵容李承晚背信弃义强迫扣留二万七千余朝中战俘一事是侮辱了美国政府，使他不得不中断会谈；然而转过背去，迪安在汉城就得意忘形地把逃会的真实意图完全暴露出来了。他一再发出狂妄的叫嚣，企图干涉与他的职务毫不相干的中立国遣返委员会的工作，并居然指定那一天停止解释工作，那一天使战俘获得“平民身份”，那一天解散中立国遣返委员会，他甚至公开声称要出动美军配合李蒋特务劫夺现在在东场里的战俘。这种叫嚣进一步证明，迪安逃会的真正原因并不在于朝中代表指责了美方背信弃义，而是美国要实现它的强迫扣留战俘的计划，有意使政治会议不得召开，以逃避战俘遣返问题被提到政治会议去讨论。这显然是美国政府的另一种破坏朝鲜停战协定的背信弃义的行为。
    拖延和阻挠政治会议的召开，是美国政府蓄谋已久的计划。朝鲜停战协定签字后不久，美国通讯社就透露说：“很多美国人今日准备甚至在远东政治会议尚未开始之前，就把它当作一个失败的会议而一笔勾销。”（合众社八月七日纽约电）在世界舆论的压力下，美国不得不派代表到板门店来和朝中方面会谈；但从会谈开始的第一天起，迪安就采取了极端无赖的拖延手段。当百慕大会议结束、联合国大会行将休会的时候，美国通讯社公开宣传，杜勒斯已指示迪安可以随时中断会谈。迪安逃会之后，美国国际新闻社引一位所谓“消息灵通人士”的话说：“共方关于背信弃义的指责，是‘使骆驼背折的最后加上的一枝麦杆’。”就是说，美国中断会谈的一切准备都早已做好了，迪安抓住任何一个无聊的藉口，都可以实现美国政府的预定计划。
    但是，迪安选择朝中方面指责美方纵容李承晚强迫扣留二万七千余名朝中战俘这件事来作为中断会谈的“最后一枝麦杆”，是十分愚蠢的。因为美方纵容李承晚集团强迫扣留战俘的背信弃义行为，是世所共知共见的。正如开城观察家在十二月十五日的评论中所指出的，这一事件老早就“已被作为无可抵赖的背信弃义行为而载入历史记录”。迪安居然想抓住这种彰明昭著的事情作为藉口，这就使人们更容易看清楚他为了中继双方会谈是多么不择手段了。
    迪安说，指责美方背信弃义是不实在的，但迪安始终没有举出半点理由来说明这种指责为什么是不实在的。他只能重复克拉克、哈利逊之流那一句早就被人戳穿了一千次的谎话，说战俘是“违反”美国的“意愿”由李承晚“释放”的，美国“在事前毫无所知”。这种说法本身就是背信弃义的。美方是不是真的“在事前毫无所知”呢？这显然是在当面扯谎。全世界都知道，“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”在六月八日签字之后，美国走狗李承晚的伪国会立刻就通过了一项决议，公开提出要立即
  “释放”战俘。与此同时，李承晚的喽罗们还连日在南朝鲜许多城市举行“游行”，法新社在六月十二日报道说：“在汉城今日的游行中，最普遍的口号是：‘释放反共战俘’。早先，从南朝鲜官员方面得来的消息暗示：南朝鲜可能立刻释放拒绝遣返的北朝鲜和中国战俘。”对于这些当时全世界都知道了的事实，就在南朝鲜的美国军事当局，难道能说事先不知道吗？合众社在六月十八日的电讯中透露：
  “克拉克将军的高级参谋人员过去就预先料到李承晚的行动。”“华盛顿邮报”在六月二十日的社论中也承认：“很难想像释放北朝鲜战俘的事件能完全出乎（美国）第八军的意料之外。”可是，美方的克拉克、哈利逊、迪安之流，居然想抵赖说“事前毫无所知”，这不是背信弃义是什么？
    而且，当美国将军哈利逊在“职权范围”协议上签字的时候，他是代表所谓“联合国军总司令”的，还是李奇微当“联合国军总司令”的时候，他就说过南朝鲜的李承晚伪军是属于他所管辖的，以后美方也从来没有否认过李承晚军队是属于所谓联合国军司令部管辖，甚至美国政府在六月十日邀请瑞士参加中立国遣返委员会的一项照会中还说：
  “韩国的武装部队和在朝鲜的其他十五个联合国会员国的军队一样，都是处于联合国军司令部的管辖之下的。”那末，人们看看这场拙劣的把戏吧：“联合国军总司令”一面派遣他的谈判代表哈利逊在板门店签订“职权范围”协议，一面却放任他所管辖下的李承晚军队在釜山撕毁这个协议，而迪安之流居然说，美方对此毫无责任，毫无所知，这难道不是典型的背信弃义的行为么？
    无数的事实都表明，今年六月强迫扣留二万七千余朝中战俘的背信弃义事件，不仅美方事先知情，而且是美国军队和李承晚匪帮合谋干出来的。据上面提到过的美国政府六月十日的照会中说：战俘
  “是由联合国军司令部拘押的，唯有联合国军司令部负责所有战俘的管制和警卫工作。”六月十八日美联社透露，南朝鲜美方战俘营的“营场长官”都是美国人，看守的卫兵中有美军也有南朝鲜伪军，而南朝鲜伪军“是在美国人员监督之下工作的”。在这样的战俘营中，如果没有美国“营场长官”和美国看守部队的合谋，李承晚伪军能够通行无阻地去“释放”成千成万的战俘么？而且强迫扣留这二万七千余战俘的事件并不是发生在一天之内，而是在接连的许多天之内完成的。甚至在哈利逊已经写信告诉南日大将，声称已把看守战俘的李伪军“由美军予以替换”之后，美方还继续“释放”了朝中战俘两千余人。这难道不是铁一样地证明劫夺战俘的背信弃义行为是美李合谋干的吗？事件发生后，美方所采取的一连串的背信弃义的行动，更进一步证明了这次事件的合谋性质。大家记得，美方为了逃避世界舆论的谴责，曾赶紧叫哈利逊在六月十八日写信给南日大将，声称美方“正在尽力追回现在在逃的战俘。”可是，美方所做的却完全背弃了这个诺言。美方不仅没有采取任何有效行动去负责追回
  “在逃的战俘”，而且公开庇护李承晚强迫扣留战俘的行动。美国国际新闻社在六月十九日透露，美方战俘营司令部的一个高级发言人说：美军远东司令部“已经接到通知，不叫它下令进行深入的搜捕
  （即负责追回战俘）运动。”这个通讯社透露，李承晚匪军公开押解着成批的战俘在釜山街上经过，
  “但是美国宪兵奉命不得干涉任何逃跑的战俘”。这难道不是预先准备的合谋行为么？美方完全没有打算履行它的代表哈利逊向南日大将所作的诺言，这难道不是背信弃义的行为么？
    美方强迫扣留二万七千余战俘的严重事件的背信弃义的性质，是迪安之流所绝不能抵赖得了的。甚至路透社在六月二十四日报道英国“每日先驱报”对这一事件的评论说：“正如温斯敦·邱吉尔爵士所说的，这种蛮横的与背信弃义的行动，给我们提出了简单而十分重要的问题：谁负责控制南朝鲜？”美国的所谓“盟国”是这样说的，为什么美方却不敢反驳半句呢？为什么美方不说是侮辱了它呢？
    可是，现在当美国要按照它预定的步骤来中断双方会谈的时候，迪安就连忙抓住朝中方面指责美方背信弃义强迫扣留二万七千余战俘的发言，哭丧着脸说这是什么对美国的“侮辱”，并且不顾一切地以此作为藉口打断双方会谈。美方这样急不暇择地寻衅中断双方会谈，甚至连某些侵朝帮凶国家也感到不安，认为“迪安没有选择适当的问题进行摊牌”，这就完全暴露了美方中断双方会谈是预定的阴谋。
