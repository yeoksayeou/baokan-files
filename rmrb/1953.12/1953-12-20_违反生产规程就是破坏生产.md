    Violating Production Regulations is Sabotaging Production
    Reader Liu Yiping writes: During the October Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign, the Sanbao Mine No. 2 Pit of the Beipiao Mining Bureau still had 420 tons of coal production task unfulfilled by the 20th. Seeing that the end of the month was approaching, Pit Manager Cui was worried and restless. Finally, Pit Manager Cui came up with a "brilliant plan" to complete the task. From that day on, whether it was a bitterly cold night or a snowy day, Pit Manager Cui would often diligently stand at the pit entrance, shouting to the workers below: "You must complete the task!"
    "We already know that, but the geological conditions have changed!" the workers replied.
    "I don't care, you can handle the situation as you see fit, as long as you can complete the task." After the workers understood the "implication" in Pit Manager Cui's words, they silently went down into the pit to work. Sure enough, Pit Manager Cui's "brilliant plan" worked. At the end of the month, the accounts showed that not only was the monthly task completed, but it was exceeded by 50 tons.
    However, the secret of the "brilliant plan" was soon exposed. It turned out that under the instigation of the pit manager, the workers peeled off a layer of fifteen or six meters long from the safety coal pillar protecting the return air roadway. This section of the roadway has mostly collapsed because it lost the support of the coal pillar. If we want to expand production next year, we must immediately send people and money to repair it.
    Only thinking about immediate convenience, disregarding future consequences; using means that violate production regulations in order to complete one's own competition "task," this is Pit Manager Cui's "brilliant plan." What is particularly noteworthy is that there are far more people like Pit Manager Cui now. They should learn a lesson from the result of Pit Manager Cui's "completion of production tasks" and not be "production task completers" who sabotage production regulations.

### 违反生产规程就是破坏生产

    违反生产规程就是破坏生产
    读者刘一平来信：在十月份增产节约竞赛中，北票矿务局三宝矿二坑到二十日还有四百二十吨煤的生产任务没有完成。眼看就到月底了，崔坑长为这件事愁眉苦脸，坐卧不安。终于，崔坑长想出了一条完成任务的“妙策”。从那天以后，不论是寒风凛冽的黑夜，还是大雪纷飞的白天，崔坑长经常辛辛苦苦地守在坑口，对着坑下的工人们喊：“要完成任务啊！”
    “我们早就知道，可是地质条件有变化呀！”工人们这样回答。
   “那我不管，你们瞧着情况办吧，反正能完成任务就行。”工人们听懂了崔坑长话里的“文章”之后，就默默地下坑工作去了。果然，崔坑长的“妙策”生效了，到月终一算账，不仅完成全月任务，而且超过了五十吨。
    可是“妙策”的秘密不久就暴露了。原来在坑长怂恿之下，工人们把保护回风巷道的保安煤柱扒去了十五、六公尺长的一层皮。这段巷道因为失掉煤柱的支持，现已大部坍塌了。明年要扩大生产，非马上出人、出钱抢修不可。
    只图眼前方便，不顾来日后果；为了完成自己的竞赛“任务”，不惜违反生产规程的手段，这便是崔坑长的“妙策”。尤其值得注意的是，有这类想法的人现在远非崔坑长一人。他们应该从崔坑长 “完成生产任务”的结果中得到教训，不要做一个破坏生产规程的“生产任务完成者”。
