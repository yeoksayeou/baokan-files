    Blind Self-Satisfaction is the Enemy of Business Expertise
    Wang Yueru, Director of Datun Ore Dressing Plant, Gejiu Tin Mine
    and Director of Construction Site 532
    When the state began implementing the First Five-Year Plan, the Party transferred me to the Gejiu Tin Mine Ore Dressing Plant as director. At that time, I had just returned from the rural land reform, and immediately stepped onto a new and unfamiliar job with confidence.
    When I arrived at my new job, Yue Sheng, the Secretary of the Gejiu Municipal Party Committee, asked us to earnestly study production work, become familiar with the business, not be afraid of difficulties, and not be afraid of criticism; we should also not put on airs, and learn from everyone who knows more than ourselves. When I first arrived at the ore dressing plant, I was able to earnestly study the work. In less than a month, I became familiar with the production process, understood some simple machine names, and learned some methods of leading industry. In addition, the production tasks in the first quarter were relatively light, so I completed the tasks ahead of schedule and exceeded the quota, and was commended. But I developed a blindly optimistic and arrogant mood, forgot the leadership of the Party, forgot the wisdom and labor of the masses, attributed all the achievements to myself, and thought that I was remarkable, could learn everything at once, and that industry was not difficult to manage. After that, I no longer delved into production work; I rarely went to the site, and even when I did, I would just take a walk around and come back. Later, I spent all day sitting in the office listening to reports, holding meetings, and reviewing official documents. I also did not pay as much attention to the instructions from higher authorities as before, thinking that the instructions were not specific enough to solve problems, or did not take into account the objective conditions of the factory. I also did not mobilize and rely on the workers, mistakenly believing that the workers were lax and had loose labor discipline. I also looked down on comrades who had transferred from the military at the same time or had been transferred for a longer period of time, thinking that they were not as good at delving into things and learning as I was. Under such circumstances, how could I manage production? I could only blindly rely on the technicians, entrusting major technical measures to the technicians, and only assigning tasks without checking, and then ignoring them after assigning them. The result of doing so was: although the output of tin concentrate in the second quarter increased by 20% compared to the first quarter, the processing volume decreased by 7%, the grade of concentrate decreased by 6.5%, and the grade of tailings increased by 1.3%. The tasks for April and May were only 92% completed, causing serious losses to the Party and the people.
    The workers and cadres in the factory were very dissatisfied with my arrogance and bureaucratic style, and even the technicians I relied on were dissatisfied with me. Everyone raised a lot of opinions to me. At that time, I accepted them verbally, but I did not really recognize my mistakes. I still emphasized objective difficulties, and even became emotional because of it. The Party once again educated me and rescued me, and slowly made me sober up. Yue Sheng, the Secretary of the Gejiu Municipal Party Committee, personally talked to me, helped me analyze the situation, and pointed out my problems. In addition, the ore dressing plant, under the leadership of other comrades (at this time, the Party had transferred me to the Datun Ore Dressing Plant), overfulfilled its tasks every month, which made me realize my past shortcomings.
    At the Datun Ore Dressing Plant, I returned to the path pointed out to me by the Party, earnestly delved into things, relied on the masses, conducted investigations and research, and learned from workers and technicians when I encountered things I didn't understand, and asked the higher-level Party committee for instructions. In this way, I gradually learned to start from the basic situation, grasp the plan, and distinguish the primary and secondary tasks of the work. During this period, although there were still many shortcomings in the work, following the instructions of the Party and relying on the efforts of all employees, I finally completed and overfulfilled the engineering tasks for June, July, and August. This made me deeply feel that no matter what I learn, I cannot be proud and complacent with a little gain, especially as a Communist Party member, I must delve into it more humbly and work hard to have greater gains. This made me understand that a cadre leading industrial construction must understand technology and be proficient in business; when I understood some technology, the work went smoothly, and when I didn't understand and didn't ask, the work failed and the plan fell through. This made me understand that a Communist Party member, under no circumstances, can leave the leadership of the Party and be divorced from the masses; otherwise, he will isolate himself, lose his reliance, and fail to complete the tasks assigned by the Party. I will learn from the lessons, rely closely on the Party and the masses, deeply study the business, and strive to complete the tasks assigned to me by the Party and the people.

    盲目自满是钻研业务的敌人
    个旧锡矿大屯选矿厂厂长
    兼五三二工地主任  王月如
    当国家开始执行第一个五年计划的时候，党抽调我到个旧锡矿选矿厂担任厂长的职务。这时，我刚从农村搞土地改革回来，遂即满怀信心地走上我所不熟悉的新的工作岗位。
    到了新的工作岗位，个旧市委书记岳胜同志就要我们认真钻研生产工作，熟悉业务，不要怕困难，不要怕受批评；也不要摆架子，要向一切比自己懂得多的人学习。刚到选矿厂时，我还能认真地钻研工作，不到一个月，就熟悉了生产过程，懂得了些简单的机器名称，学会了一些领导工业的方法；加上第一季度生产任务较轻，因此提前并超额完成了任务，受到了表扬。可是我却因此产生了盲目乐观和自高自大的情绪，忘记了党的领导，忘记了群众的智慧和劳动，把成绩都算在自己身上，并以为自己很了不起，一学就会，工业并不难搞。这样我再也不深入钻研生产工作了；很少去现场，就是去了，也是转一圈就回来了。到后来，就一天到晚坐在办公室里听汇报，开会，批阅公文。对上级指示也不像以前那样的重视了，认为指示不具体不解决问题，或者是不照顾厂里的客观情况。我也不去发动和依靠工人，错误地认为工人散漫，劳动纪律松弛。我还瞧不起同时转业和转业时间比较长的同志，认为他们还不如自己钻得好，学得多。在这种情况下，怎么管理生产呢？只有盲目地依靠技术人员，把重大的技术措施交给技术员去做，而且只布置，不检查，交出去以后便不闻不问。这样做的结果是：第二季度大锡虽比第一季提高百分之二十，但处理量却降低百分之七，精矿品位降低百分之六点五，尾矿品位提高百分之一点三。四、五两月的任务仅只完成百分之九十二，给党给人民造成了严重的损失。
    厂里的工人、干部对我的自高自大和官僚主义作风非常不满，甚至我所依靠的技术人员也对我不满。大家对我提了不少意见。当时我口头上是接受了，实际上并没有真正认识自己的错误，仍然强调客观困难，甚至因此闹情绪。党又一次教育了我，挽救了我，使我慢慢地清醒起来。个旧市委书记岳胜同志亲自和我谈话，帮助我分析情况，指出毛病。加上选矿厂在别的同志的领导下（这时党已调我到大屯选矿厂），月月都超额完成任务，这才使我认识了过去的缺点。
    在大屯选矿厂，我又回到了党所指给我的道路上去，认真地深入下去，依靠群众，进行调查研究，遇到不懂的东西就向工人、技术人员学习，向上级党委请示。这样逐步地学会了从基本情况出发，掌握计划，分清工作的主次。这一时期，虽然工作中仍有不少缺点，但是遵照着党的指示，依靠全体职工的努力，终于完成和超额完成了六、七、八三个月工程任务。这就使我深深地感到不管学习什么东西，都不能有一点收获就骄傲自满，特别是共产党员，要更加虚心地钻进去，下苦功夫，才能有更大的收获。这就使我懂得了一个领导工业建设的干部必须懂得技术，精通业务；当我懂得一些技术时，工作就作得顺利，当我不懂又不问的时候，工作就失败，计划就落空。这就使我懂得了一个共产党员，不管在什么情况下，都不能离开党的领导和脱离群众；否则，就要使自己孤立，失去依靠，而不能完成党所交给的任务。我要接受教训，紧紧地依靠党和群众，深入地钻研业务，努力完成党和人民交给我的任务。
