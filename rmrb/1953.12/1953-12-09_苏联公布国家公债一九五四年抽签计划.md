Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th: TASS Moscow reports: Moscow newspapers on the 4th published an article by P. Dmitriev, head of the Soviet Ministry of Finance's State Savings Bank and the State Loan Administration, regarding the announcement of the lottery plan for national bonds in 1954. The author pointed out that the Soviet Ministry of Finance has approved the lottery plan. The plan stipulates that there will be sixteen prize-winning lotteries and four principal repayment lotteries for bonds purchased by residents. The 3% interest-bearing national bonds that can be freely bought and sold by savings banks will have six major lotteries and one supplementary lottery.

Dmitriev said that the Soviet Union's annual budget allocates a large amount of funds to repay national bonds. In 1951, this amount was 4.9 billion rubles, in 1952 it was 6.8 billion rubles, and in 1953 it will reach 9.8 billion rubles. In 1954, the principal of national bonds repaid to residents by the state will be much more than in previous years.

The Soviet government correctly fulfills its obligations to national bonds: it holds prize-winning lotteries and principal repayment lotteries in accordance with the government's decision each time it issues bonds. Each prize-winning or principal repayment lottery is held publicly, allowing citizens to assist during the lottery. The lottery locations are distributed in various cities in the Soviet Union, usually held on Sundays in large buildings such as theaters, clubs, and cultural palaces, which are always crowded with people during the lottery. For the lottery, a committee of twenty-five to thirty people will be established, including representatives from the government and public organizations, as well as representatives from industry, transportation, and agriculture. Their work is supervised by the audience watching the lottery. During the lottery, five- or six-year-old children take out small rolls of paper from the lottery wheel to determine the winning bond numbers. Therefore, residents can be sure of the fairness of the lottery.

    苏联公布国家公债一九五四年抽签计划
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：四日莫斯科各报登载了苏联财政部国家储蓄银行和国家贷款总署署长普·德米特里切夫就公布国家公债一九五四年抽签计划而写的一篇文章。作者指出：苏联财政部已经批准了抽签计划。计划规定，居民认购的公债将举行十六次中奖抽签和四次还本抽签。储蓄银行能自由买卖的周息三厘的国家公债，将举行六次主要的抽签和一次补充抽签。
    德米特里切夫说：苏联每年的预算都拨出大批款项来偿还国家公债。一九五一年，这笔款项为四十九亿卢布，一九五二年为六十八亿卢布，一九五三年将达九十八亿卢布。在一九五四年，居民得到国家偿还的公债本金，将比以上各年度还要多得多。
    苏联政府正确地履行它对国家公债的义务：它按照政府每次发行公债时的决定举行中奖抽签和还本抽签。每次中奖抽签或还本抽签都公开举行，使公民能在抽签时予以协助。抽签的地点分布在苏联各城市，一般的是星期日在剧院、俱乐部和文化宫等大建筑物中举行，抽签时这些大建筑物总是挤满了人。为了抽签，还将成立一个由二十五人到三十个人组成的委员会，其中包括政府和公众团体代表，工业、运输业和农业代表。他们的工作是受到来看抽签的观众们的监督的。抽签时，由五六岁的小孩子从彩轮中取出一小卷一小卷纸来决定中奖债券的号数。因此，居民可以确知抽签的公平。
