Brave and Diligent Korean People

Double Hero

At dawn, the enemy's counterattack began, with artillery shells and bombs raining down near Mount Gari. On the position held by the Bai Mingji company of a certain unit of the Korean People's Army, the entire hilltop was ablaze, most of the fortifications were destroyed, and the enemy was approaching. However, there was no sound of retaliation from the position. It was not until a group of enemies rushed to within ten to fifteen meters of the front of the position that Bai Mingji and the soldiers he led began to fiercely attack the enemy with grenades and machine guns. The attacking enemies were quickly decimated. In this day's battle, Bai Mingji alone killed more than sixty enemies. The next day, the enemy launched another counterattack. Under Bai Mingji's resourceful command, the entire team cut off the enemy's retreat, wiping out more than three hundred enemies. This happened on April 9, 1951. On August 8 of the same year, Bai Mingji was awarded the title of "Republic Hero."

On July 16 this year, Bai Mingji once again established glorious merit in the battle of "Captain's Hill." At 9:50 am that day, a team of Korean People's Army soldiers commanded by Bai Mingji, under the cover of artillery fire, attacked the enemy's front line position and engaged in hand-to-hand combat. After destroying three bunkers in a row on the hillside, Bai Mingji immediately ordered propagandist Li Dongxi to rush up the mountain under artillery fire and plant the flag of the Republic on the high ground. Then he shouted, "Comrades! For our beloved motherland, advance towards that flag!" Encouraged by Bai Mingji, the soldiers looked at the flag of the Republic fluttering on the high ground and shouted "Long live!" They captured the high ground in just seven minutes. Therefore, on November 9, the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea gave him the glorious title of "Republic Double Hero."

For the Party Membership Card

On June 27 this year, Shen Dongxie, a company commander of a certain unit of the Korean People's Army who was recuperating in a tent on the bank of the Jianlong Reservoir in South Pyongan Province, suddenly heard shouts of "Help! Help!" He rushed out of the tent and saw a small boat sinking in the reservoir, with an old woman and a child in it. Disregarding his illness, he jumped into the water and quickly swam to the place where the small boat sank, rescuing the old woman and the child. It turned out that the old woman was a military dependent named Li Shuji, who was going to Pyongyang to see her son who had not returned home since the war. The child was rowing the small boat. As soon as Granny Li regained consciousness, she burst into tears because she found that the small package containing her Labor Party membership card had been washed away by the water. Shen Dongxie was also a member of the Labor Party, and he knew the significance of the party membership card for a party member, so he jumped into the water again to retrieve the package.

Five minutes, ten minutes passed, but Shen Dongxie had not surfaced. The People's Army soldiers nearby rushed to the scene and searched for four hours before pulling Shen Dongxie up. Shen Dongxie sacrificed himself, but he was holding the small package with Granny Li's party membership card tightly in his hands.

Hero Driver

Song Youcheng, the well-known hero driver of the entire republic, has participated in the transportation team since the first day of the war, supporting the front line and supporting victory. In May 1952, he received a new car. Initially, he drove an average of 200 kilometers per day, which greatly exceeded the original planned mileage of 137 kilometers. Later, it increased month by month. Between October and December last year, his highest daily mileage record reached 680 kilometers.

During this period, he also led a transportation team composed of more than a dozen cars, accurately completing the important transportation tasks assigned by his superiors. One day, their entire team of cars, fully loaded with gasoline barrels, was speeding south. When they reached the vicinity of Sariwon, enemy planes suddenly dropped flares and madly strafed one of their cars. In this emergency situation, Song Youcheng calmly directed the entire team of cars to escape the danger and finally safely transported the gasoline to the front line.

In this way, Song Youcheng created a new record of safe driving of more than 55,000 kilometers in the ten months since June 1952.

For this, Song Youcheng received the "First Class National Flag Medal."

Military Dependents Increase Production

This is the first peaceful autumn in Korea after the armistice. On the boundless Fuluo Plain of Yanzhou County, the ears of grain hanging low are turning up a golden wave.

On this day, Xu Zonghao, a farmer and military dependent of Longbei Village, got to the fields before dawn to harvest rice.

Xu Zonghao, who turned over after the "August 15" liberation, immediately sent his son to the front line after the outbreak of the war. He and his daughter-in-law, Zhang Meirong, worked diligently to cultivate 1.4 hectares of land at home. Last year, Zhang Meirong also became the first female plow handler in the village. Xu Zonghao's family planned to produce eight tons of rice per hectare this year. In order to complete this plan, they completed transplanting and weeding work ahead of schedule. This summer, a flash flood broke out on Longqu Mountain, and floods inundated thousands of acres of paddy fields. Xu Zonghao and the farmers in the village worked day and night to build river embankments and actively prevent floods. They finally overcame the flood and strived for this year's harvest.

From morning till night on this day, autumn harvest competitions were enthusiastically launched between various mutual aid groups, and harvest songs were sung everywhere in the rice fields.

Early the next morning, ox carts hanging the flag of the Republic formed a long line, heading from Longbei Village to the public grain warehouse. Xu Zonghao happily drove his ox cart in the middle of the team. He completed his production plan and harvested more than eight metric tons of rice per hectare this year.

    勇敢勤劳的朝鲜人民
    双重英雄
    黎明时分，敌人的反扑开始了，炮弹炸弹骤雨般地落在加里山附近。在朝鲜人民军某部白明基中队据守的阵地上，整个山头都燃烧起来了，工事大半被摧毁了，敌人逼近着，可是阵地上却没有还击的声音。直到一群敌人冲到离阵地前沿十公尺到十五公尺的地方时，白明基和他带领的战士们才开始了用手榴弹和机关枪对敌人猛烈打击，冲上来的敌人很快就被打得死伤过半了。在这一天的战斗中，白明基一个人就打死了六十多个敌人。第二天，敌人又进行了反扑。全队在白明基的机智指挥下，切断了敌人的退路，把三百多个敌人消灭个干净。这是一九五一年四月九日的事。同年八月八日，白明基获得了“共和国英雄”的称号。
    今年七月十六日，在“大队长高地”的战斗中，白明基再一次建立了光荣的功勋。当天上午九时五十分，白明基指挥的一队人民军战士，在炮火掩护下，一路攻到了敌人的前沿阵地，和敌人展开了肉搏战。他们在山腰上接连打毁三座碉堡以后，白明基立刻命令宣传员李东熙冒着炮火跑上山去，把共和国国旗插在高地上，然后高喊：“战友们！为了我们可爱的祖国，朝着那旗帜前进啊！”战士们在白明基的鼓舞下，望着那面飘扬在高地上的共和国国旗，高呼“万岁”，仅仅七分钟就攻下了这个高地。因此，十一月九日，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会又给了他“共和国双重英雄”的光荣称号。
    为了党证
    今年六月二十七日，在平安南道的见龙贮水池的岸上，一个正在帐篷中养病的朝鲜人民军某部中队长申东爕，突然听到“救人啊！救人啊！”的喊声，他慌忙跑出帐篷，看到在贮水池上，一只小船正在下沉，船上坐着一个老大娘，还有一个十多岁的儿童。他顾不得身上有病，纵身跳入水中，迅速游到小船沉下去的地方，把老大娘和小孩子救了上来。原来老大娘是一个军属，名叫李淑姬，现在要到平壤去看战争中一直没有回家的儿子去，小孩是划这个小船的。李大娘刚刚清醒过来，忽然又掩面大哭起来，因为她发现包着劳动党党证的小包袱被水冲走了。申东爕也是一个劳动党党员，他深知党证对于一个党员的意义，于是他又跳下水去，打捞那个包袱。
    五分钟，十分钟过去了，申东爕还没有浮上来。附近的人民军战士赶来，下水找寻了四个钟头，才把申东爕捞起。申东爕牺牲了，可是在他手里却紧紧地抱着有李大娘党证的那个小包袱。
    英雄司机
    宋有成，这个全共和国知名的英雄司机，从战争的第一天起就参加了运输队，支援前线，支援胜利。一九五二年的五月，他领到了一辆新车。起初，他每天平均行驶二百公里，这已大大超过了原计划一百三十七公里的行程。以后月月提高。到去年十月十二月之间，他每天最高的行驶纪录已经达到六百八十公里了。
    这期间他还带领着由十几辆汽车组成的运输小组，准确地完成了上级交给的重要运输任务。有一天，他们全组的汽车满载汽油桶向南急驶，到沙里院附近时，敌机突然投下照明弹，并且向他们中间的一辆汽车疯狂扫射，在这种紧急情况下，宋有成依然沉着地指挥全组汽车脱离了险境，终于把汽油安全运上了火线。
    就这样，宋有成从一九五二年六月以后的十个月中创造了安全行车五万五千多公里的新纪录。
    为此，宋有成得到了“一级国旗勋章”的奖励。
    军属增产
    这是停战后朝鲜的第一个和平的秋天。一望无际的盐州郡府罗平野上，低沉地垂着头的谷穗，翻起一片金色的波浪。
    这一天，龙北里的农民、人民军军属许宗浩，天没明就赶到地里来割稻。
    “八·一五”解放后翻了身的许宗浩，在战争爆发后，立刻就把自己的儿子送上前线。自己在家和儿媳妇张梅蓉一起辛勤地耕种着一公顷四的土地。去年张梅蓉又当上了村里的第一个女犁扶手。许宗浩家订了计划，今年要在每公顷田地上生产八吨稻子。为了完成这个计划，他们提前完成了移秧和锄草工作。今年夏天，龙屈山上山洪暴发，洪水淹没了几千亩稻田。许宗浩就和村里的农民们一起日夜修筑河堤，积极防汛。他们终于战胜了水灾，争取了今年的丰收。
    这天从早到晚，各个互助组之间热烈展开了秋收竞赛，稻田里到处歌唱着丰收之歌。
    第二天一大早，挂着共和国国旗的牛车，排成一字长蛇阵，从龙北里向公粮仓库走去。许宗浩愉快地赶着牛车走在这个队伍中间。他完成了自己的生产计划，今年在一公顷土地上收获了八公吨以上的稻子。
