    Refuting the "Peasant Backwardness Theory"
    Ma Tieding

    "The peasants are too backward, extremely backward!" This old tune has been sung for many years, and the sound has long been weak and powerless. But at this moment, when we are vigorously publicizing the general line, when we propose to overcome the spontaneous capitalist tendencies of the peasants, some people are secretly rejoicing: "Isn't it? I said long ago that the peasants are backward!" Look, the "Peasant Backwardness Theory" has a somewhat resurgent air about it.

    Are peasants backward? No, at least the dominant and basic aspects of the peasants are not backward. The peasants are reliable allies of the proletarian revolution. The Chinese peasants formed an alliance with the working class in the new democratic revolution, and under the leadership of the working class, they won the victory of the revolution, liberated themselves, obtained land, and gained freedom. The peasants will not forget the benefits brought to them by the leadership of the working class, so they can and will continue to move towards a socialist society under the leadership of the working class. At the same time, the peasants are laborers who suffered greatly from the exploitation of landlords and speculators in the old society, and they are hostile to these exploiters. In the future, only socialism can bring them a happy life, while capitalism brings them only poverty and suffering; therefore, they can follow the working class to socialism and reject capitalism. And this is precisely the basic and dominant aspect of the peasants. If we obliterate this basic and main aspect of the peasants and generally say that they are "backward," it is obviously extremely unfair.

    Of course, peasants also have a backward side. Peasants are small private owners, small commodity producers and sellers, so if their spontaneous tendencies as small private owners and small commodity producers are allowed to run rampant, a few of them will use methods of exploiting others (such as hoarding and dumping grain, engaging in speculative business on the free market, lending at usurious rates, hiring laborers, etc.) to seek profits. This is the spontaneous capitalist tendency of the peasants, and if this tendency is not overcome, it will enable a small number of people in the countryside to get rich through exploitation and become rich peasants, usurers, and commercial capitalists, making the vast majority of peasants poor and bankrupt. It is obviously also wrong to fail to see this backward side of the peasants.

    The mistake of the "Peasant Backwardness Theory" lies in the fact that it only sees the backward aspect of the peasants, exaggerates it, obliterates the basic aspect of the peasants that they can advance together with the working class, and therefore, in practice, denies the possibility of socialist transformation of agriculture, denies the worker-peasant alliance, and thus denies the future of socialism.

    This kind of "theory" no longer has much of a market. However, the most dangerous thing at present is that if rural workers are more or less infected with this kind of thinking, they will dislike or at least be unenthusiastic about mutual aid and cooperation, they will abandon the attitude of persuasion and education towards the peasants and adopt an attitude of coercion and attack, which will cause major losses to rural work and greatly hinder the cause of socialist transformation of agriculture.

    驳“农民落后论”
    马铁丁
    “农民太落后了，大落后了！”这个老调，唱了很多年头，声音早就低微和无力了。但在此刻，在大张旗鼓地宣传总路线的时候，当我们提出要克服农民的自发的资本主义倾向的时候，有人却在那里暗暗称快：“是不是？我早就说农民是落后的嘛！”请看，“农民落后论”很有些卷土重来的派头儿呢。
    农民落后吗？不，至少农民的主导的和基本的方面并不落后。农民是无产阶级革命的可靠的同盟军。中国的农民在新民主主义革命中和工人阶级结成了联盟，并在工人阶级的领导下取得了革命的胜利，解放了自己，获得了土地，获得了自由。农民是不会忘记工人阶级的领导所带给他们的好处的，所以他们仍旧可能而且一定会继续在工人阶级的领导下走向社会主义社会。同时，农民是劳动者，在旧社会中备受地主和投机商人的剥削，他们敌视这些剥削者。今后呢，只有社会主义才能带给他们幸福的生活，资本主义给他们的只是贫困和痛苦；因此，他们能够跟着工人阶级一起走向社会主义而拒绝资本主义。而这恰恰就是农民的基本的和主导的方面。如果抹煞了农民的这个基本的和主要的方面，一概说他们“落后”，那显然是极端不公道的。
    当然，农民也有落后的一面。农民是小私有者，是小商品生产者和出卖者，所以，如果听任他们的小私有者和小商品生产者的自发倾向泛滥起来，他们当中就会有少数人用剥削别人的方法
  （如囤粮倒粮、在自由市场上做投机生意、放高利债、雇工等等）牟取利润。这就是农民的自发的资本主义倾向，这种倾向如不加克服，就会使农村少数人靠剥削起家，变为富农、高利贷者和商业资本家，使绝大多数农民贫穷破产。看不到农民的这种落后的一面显然也是错误的。
    “农民落后论”的错误地方，就在于它只看到农民的落后的一方面，并加以夸大，把农民可以跟工人阶级一起前进的基本一面给抹煞了，因而也就在实际上否认了对农业实行社会主义改造的可能性，否认了工农联盟，也就否认了社会主义的前途。
    这种“理论”已经没有多大的市场了。然而目前最危险的是：农村工作者如果或多或少地传染上这种思想，他们就会讨厌或者至少是不热心于互助合作，就会丢弃对农民的说服教育的态度、而采取强迫和打击的态度，就会使农村工作遭受重大损失，就会大大地妨碍对农业的社会主义改造的事业。
