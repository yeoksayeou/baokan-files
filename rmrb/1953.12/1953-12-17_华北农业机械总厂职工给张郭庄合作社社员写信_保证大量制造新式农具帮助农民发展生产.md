To the Comrade Members of the Zhang Guozhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Fengtai District, Beijing:

The news of your letter to us, published in the People's Daily on the 12th of this month, quickly spread throughout our factory via the broadcasting station. After work, many workers rushed to the bulletin boards to read the large-character posters, eagerly reading the full text of the letter. The workers were delighted by the achievements of your production cooperative; welcomed and appreciated your selling more than 30,000 jin of surplus grain to the state and leading the farmers of the whole township to enthusiastically sell surplus grain to support industrial construction; and were especially pleased to learn that you liked the three-pronged weeder produced by our factory. Many workers said: We workers and peasants are like brothers. The peasants sell surplus grain to the state to support industrial construction, and we should work even harder to produce and support the development of agricultural production.

To support the farmers, our factory has manufactured more than ten kinds of new agricultural implements in the past four years, including new-style walking plows, double-wheeled double-share plows, three-pronged light weeders, and harvesters, totaling more than 300,000 pieces. To increase production and accumulate more funds for the country, all our factory workers have launched a campaign to increase production and practice economy in recent months, and have now completed the annual output value plan one month ahead of schedule. In the competition, many model deeds have emerged. For example, Comrade Jiao Xinglin, a labor model, and the group he led, improved labor organization and reduced defective products, gradually increasing the daily output of walking plowshares from 2,100 to 4,100. In four months, their group not only completed the state plan ahead of schedule, but also increased production and saved 712 million yuan for the country. Recently, the workers are happily preparing to subscribe to the "1954 National Construction Bonds," and some comrades, fearing they would not be able to buy them, have rushed to register.

Comrades of the agricultural production cooperative! Now, we report to you a good news: our factory will mass-produce harvesters next year. This machine is operated by one person, pulled by two animals, and can harvest 60 mu (mountain land) to 80 mu (plain) of wheat per day, which is many times faster than manual harvesting. We know from your letter that your cultivation is already semi-mechanized, and only harvesting still largely relies on manpower, so we feel the importance of mass-producing harvesters even more. To make the harvester cheaper, easier to use, and durable, we are actively carrying out pre-production preparations. Comrade Li Shujin, a labor model, said: "In order to develop agriculture faster, we guarantee that the harvester will fully meet the standards."

Comrade members: We hope you will study the general line well, continuously develop the business of the production cooperative, and lead and help individual farmers to gradually enter the big family of collectivization.

Finally, we hope to strengthen contact and help each other. Let us join hands and advance towards socialism!

		All workers of North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory

### 华北农业机械总厂职工给张郭庄合作社社员写信  保证大量制造新式农具帮助农民发展生产

    华北农业机械总厂职工给张郭庄合作社社员写信
    保证大量制造新式农具帮助农民发展生产
    北京市丰台区张郭庄农业生产合作社的社员同志们：
    本月十二日人民日报登出了你们给我们的来信，这一消息很快就通过广播站传遍了全厂。许多工人下班以后跑到布告牌前去看大字报，争着阅读来信的全文。职工们为你们生产合作社所取得的成绩而欢欣鼓舞；对你们把三万多斤余粮卖给国家并带动全乡农民热烈出售余粮支援工业建设，表示欢迎和感谢；特别是知道了你们喜爱我厂制造的三齿耘锄，更加高兴。很多工人表示：咱们工人和农民好比亲兄弟。农民把余粮卖给国家，支援工业建设，我们更应加倍努力生产，支援农民发展生产。
    我们厂为了支援农民，四年来已制造了新式步犁、双轮双铧犁、三齿轻便耘锄及收割机等十多种新式农具，数量共有三十多万部。为了增加生产，给国家积累更多的资金，近几个月来我们厂全体职工展开了增产节约竞赛，目前已提前一个月完成了全年产值计划。在竞赛中，出现了很多模范事迹。如劳动模范焦兴林同志和他领导的小组，由于改进了劳动组织、减少了废品，使步犁犁铧日产量由二千一百个逐步提高到四千一百个。在四个月当中，他们小组除提前完成国家计划外，还给国家增产节约七亿一千二百万元。最近，职工们正满心高兴地准备认购“一九五四年国家建设公债”，有的同志怕买不上已抢先进行登记了。
    农业生产合作社的同志们！现在报告你们一个好消息：我厂明年要大量生产收割机。这个机器由一个人操纵，用两头牲口拉，一天可以收割六十亩（山地）到八十亩（平原）的小麦，比人力收割要快好多倍。从来信中知道你们耕作已经是半机械化了，只有收割大部分还要用人力，我们就更感到大量制造收割机的重要。为了使收割机价钱便宜，用起来顺手，并且坚固耐久，我们正积极进行生产前的准备工作。劳动模范李树金同志说：“为了更快地发展农业，我们保证收割机完全合乎标准。”
    社员同志们：我们希望你们好好学习总路线，不断发展生产合作社的业务，并带动与帮助个体农民逐步走进合作化的大家庭。
    最后，希望咱们加强联系，互相帮助。让我们紧紧携手向社会主义前进吧！
                华北农业机械总厂全体职工
