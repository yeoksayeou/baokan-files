Our Safe Production is Now More Guaranteed
——A Letter from Liu Guangjin, Beijing Model Worker, to Workers of the Seamless Steel Tube Factory

Comrades of the Anshan Seamless Steel Tube Factory:

I was extremely happy to read in the newspaper the report that the Seamless Steel Tube Factory had completed its work ahead of schedule.

I work in the boiler section of the Shijingshan Power Plant. As the saying goes, "Burning boilers is like burning tubes." Seamless steel tubes are to boilers what blood vessels are to the human body. In the past, under the rule of the puppet regime and the Kuomintang, the reactionary rulers did not install the machines properly, and the seamless steel tubes in the boilers often exploded. When the furnace stopped, the workers would rest. Now it's different. Since liberation, our workers' class consciousness has improved, and we all work with the attitude of masters of the country. Take the workers in the boiler section of our Shijingshan Power Plant, for example. In 1952, we promoted the advanced Soviet experience and successfully burned low-value coal. Up to now, we have saved the country hundreds of thousands of tons of good coal. Our thinking is this: in the old society, workers were slaves to machines, and the more work they did, the more the reactionaries exploited them. In the new society, we workers are the masters of the country, and the machines belong to us. In the process of burning low-value coal, we encountered many difficulties. With everyone's efforts, we overcame them. Some of these difficulties were caused by the old seamless steel tubes in the boiler. We asked our technicians if our new China could manufacture seamless steel tubes. At that time, they said it was not yet possible. In the past, we had to buy even a single steel tube from foreign countries. Now we know that we can manufacture seamless steel tubes ourselves. You can imagine how happy we are! This matter has made us realize once again that under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and with the all-round and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, there is nothing our workers cannot do. Our creativity is endless!

With the new seamless steel tubes, our safe production is more guaranteed; with the new seamless steel tubes, we can use the energy we previously spent taking care of the old steel tubes to study new problems and further improve our technology. The new seamless steel tubes are of great benefit to our safe production and increased production and conservation, and they are also an indispensable and important material for many other economic sectors. Comrades of the Anshan Seamless Steel Tube Factory: currently, workers all over the country are launching a vigorous campaign for increased production and conservation. Everyone wants to work harder to build more factories and mines, striving for our country to achieve socialist industrialization at an early date. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, and with the help of Soviet friends, you built a first-class, technologically advanced seamless steel tube factory in just fifteen months. Your spirit of not fearing difficulties and forging ahead is a great encouragement to us. Our factory is also launching a campaign for increased production and conservation. As the Seamless Steel Tube Factory is about to officially start production, I represent all the workers of our Shijingshan Power Plant in making an agreement with you: in the future, we will definitely actively study technology, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and strive to increase production and conservation, and strive to overfulfill this year's production plan. At the same time, we hope to constantly hear good news from you!

### 我们的安全生产更加有了保证——北京市劳动模范刘光金给无缝钢管厂工人的信

    我们的安全生产更加有了保证
    ——北京市劳动模范刘光金给无缝钢管厂工人的信鞍山无缝钢管厂的工人同志们：
    我从报纸上看到无缝钢管厂提前完工的报道，心里有说不出来的高兴。
    我在石景山发电厂锅炉场工作。俗话说：“烧锅炉就是烧管子”，无缝钢管对于锅炉来说，就好像是人的血管一样。以前在敌伪和国民党统治时期，反动统治者不给安好机器，锅炉里的无缝钢管常常放炮。停了炉，工人们就歇着。现在可不同了，解放以来，咱们工人的阶级觉悟提高了，都以主人翁的态度来干活。拿我们石景山发电厂锅炉场的工人来说，一九五二年推广了苏联先进经验，试烧低值煤成功，到现在为止，一共为国家节省了几十万吨好煤。我们的想法是：在旧社会里，工人是机器的奴隶，谁干活越多，反动派就对谁剥削得越多。在新社会里，我们工人是国家的主人，机器是我们的了。在试烧低值煤的过程中，我们碰到过很多困难，在大伙的努力下，都克服了，这里面有些困难，就是因为锅炉里的无缝钢管太旧造成的。我们问过我们的技术员：咱们新中国能不能制造无缝钢管，当时他说还不行。过去我们哪怕用一根钢管也要到外国去买，现在我们知道咱们自己也能制造无缝钢管了，你们说我们心里该多高兴！这件事情使我们再一次地认识到：在共产党、毛主席的领导下，在苏联老大哥全面无私的帮助下，咱们工人没有作不成的事情，咱们的创造力是无穷无尽的！
    有了新的无缝钢管，我们的安全生产就更加有了保证；有了新的无缝钢管，我们就可以把从前照顾破旧钢管的那一部分精力拿来钻研新的问题，进一步求得技术上的改进。新的无缝钢管对我们的安全生产和增产节约有很大的好处，它也是其他许多经济部门不可缺少的重要器材。鞍山无缝钢管厂的工人同志们：目前咱们全国各地的工人正在展开轰轰烈烈的增产节约竞赛，大家都想多使一把劲，建设更多的工厂、矿山……，争取我们国家早一天实现社会主义工业化。你们在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，在苏联朋友的帮助下，十五个月就建成了优等质量的、技术最先进的无缝钢管厂。你们这种不怕困难、勇往直前的精神，对我们是很大的鼓舞。我们厂子现在也正在展开增产节约竞赛，在无缝钢管厂就要正式开工生产的时候，我代表我们石景山发电厂的全体工人同志和你们约定：今后，我们一定积极钻研技术，学习苏联的先进经验，努力增产节约，争取超额完成今年的生产计划。同时也希望不断地听到你们的捷报！
