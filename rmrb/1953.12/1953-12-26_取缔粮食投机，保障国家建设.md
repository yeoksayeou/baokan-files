    Suppress Grain Speculation, Guarantee National Construction
    Grain Cannot Be Given to Unscrupulous Merchants for Speculation and Profiteering
    Fang Xuejin Speaks
    I am a farmer from Guanjia Village, Xi'an County, Liaodong Province. Some time ago, I sold two *shi* of soybeans to a grain merchant, earning 150 yuan more per *jin* than if I had sold them to the supply and marketing cooperative. At the time, I was very happy.
    Before the soybeans were even delivered, the Party Branch Secretary of our village, Yu Zhonghou, returned from a meeting in the county. He told us about the general line and general tasks of the country during the transition period. Then everyone had a discussion and visited the exhibition. At the exhibition, I saw the beautiful prospects of using machines to cultivate the land and building power stations and libraries in the countryside in a socialist society. It really brightened my heart.
    At the exhibition, I also saw a picture depicting the speculation and profiteering by grain merchants who bought grain from farmers. At that time, I thought, wasn't it wrong of me to sell the soybeans to the grain merchant? But I was still a little confused. It was obvious that selling two *shi* of soybeans to the grain merchant would earn me several tens of thousands of yuan more. At the discussion, I brought up this question, and everyone started discussing it. Someone said that selling two *shi* of soybeans to the grain merchant would earn a few tens of thousands of yuan more, but the grain merchant could use these soybeans to speculate and profiteer, possibly earning several times that amount. If everyone did this, the grain merchants would control the grain, driving up prices, and everything would become more expensive. Furthermore, if grain prices were high for workers, the cost of weaving cloth would increase, and the price of cloth would be higher, and we farmers would still suffer. Cao Yunliang said:
  “We can't just look at the immediate benefits, we should look further ahead. If we sell grain to the state, we support the country's industrial construction. Workers can produce new-style farm tools and tractors for us, helping us develop production. If we sell grain to grain merchants, allowing them to speculate and profiteer, exploiting the people and undermining national construction, we will still have to live a life of hard labor!”
    These words were very educational for me. I made up my mind not to give up the long-term big interests and decided to sell the grain to the state. Not only would I send these two *shi* of soybeans to the supply and marketing cooperative, but I would also sell all the remaining grain I wanted to sell to the state. No matter how much more the grain merchant offers, I will resolutely not sell to him!

    Not a Single Grain Should Be Sold to Speculative Unscrupulous Merchants
    Ai Guangrong Speaks
    My name is Ai Guangrong, and I am a farmer from Wenwu Township, Hanshou County, Hunan Province. In the past, I did not understand the principle that grain should be sold to the state and not to speculative merchants. I thought, what does it matter who I sell to, making more money is the real thing.
    Recently, I heard the report on the general line of the state during the transition period, and my heart brightened. Grain being taken by unscrupulous merchants for speculation and profiteering is really harmful to farmers. Take our township as an example. During the lean months this year, an unscrupulous merchant in our township sold rice to grain-deficient households at a high price of more than 2,000 yuan per *jin*. This unscrupulous merchant also said: "My baby obeys me, you can take it or leave it, even if I sell it for 3,000 yuan per *jin*, you have to listen to me." Fortunately, the government has always supplied us with rice at a price of 700 yuan per *jin*, which solved the difficulties of the grain-deficient households. I will never forget the pain that unscrupulous merchants inflicted on us farmers by raising grain prices, and I will never forget the help of the People's Government. Therefore, I am determined not to sell a single grain to unscrupulous merchants, and I will sell all my 1,200 *jin* of surplus grain to the state. Liu Desheng, Xia Zhengai, and other six farmers who live next to me are also preparing to sell all 5,800 *jin* of their surplus grain to the state to support the country's economic construction.

    We Must Recognize the "Evil White Faces" of Grain Merchants
    Li Chengjun Speaks
    Around the Mid-Autumn Festival this year, the price of wheat in Huangdun Township, Xinyi County, Jiangsu Province, was raised by grain speculation merchants from 520 yuan per *jin* to 560 yuan, and further south to Wayao, it was raised to 620 yuan. Some people who had wheat seeds sold them to speculative grain dealers for a few thousand yuan of "cheap" money, but those who needed wheat seeds could not buy them at a reasonable price. At that time, everyone hated the grain speculation merchants with a passion, hoping that the government would stabilize grain prices and severely punish these bad elements.
    Some farmers, seeing the high prices offered by the unscrupulous merchants, wanted to take advantage of the small benefits and sell grain to the unscrupulous merchants. They still didn't know who it would benefit the farmers to sell the grain to. Take this year's lean season as an example. At that time, the grain speculation merchants disregarded the life and death of the farmers and even smuggled grain out of the disaster areas. The government transported grain from Northeast China, thousands of miles away, at great expense, and the price of corn per *jin* was 70 yuan cheaper than the local grain price. The farmers of Xinyi County all saw with their own eyes the government transporting disaster relief grain from Xinyi to Suqian. How much transportation cost would it take for those small carts, but when it was sold to the disaster victims in Suqian, it was still 20 yuan cheaper per *jin* than in Xinyi. We must recognize who it is good and bad to sell grain to. If you see the high prices offered by the unscrupulous merchants and don't sell grain to the state, you will have to pay an even higher price to buy it when you need grain. If the unscrupulous merchants drive up grain prices, other prices will follow, and we farmers will also suffer. If we sell grain to the state, the state will not only supply us with the grain we need at any time, but also ensure that the people in the cities have food to eat, so that everyone can concentrate on construction. In the future, we will be able to live a happy life in a socialist society. (Recorded by Zhao Litian, et al.)
    Support the Government's Strict Suppression of Grain Speculation
    Wang Zhenxiang Speaks
    I am a female worker in the private Wanxiang Knitting Factory in Changsha City, Hunan Province. I was very happy when I recently heard that the government was going to strictly suppress grain speculation.
    In the past, I didn't know how much suffering I endured from grain speculation merchants in order to buy rice. Before liberation, when workers had a few pennies at the end of the month or the end of the year, the price of rice would rise, and a month's wages could only buy two or three *dou* of rice. In 1949, just after liberation, I went to a grain merchant to buy rice. When the grain merchant saw that there were many people buying rice, he closed the door and refused to sell. It was clear that the rice in the rice shop was piled up like mountains, but the grain merchant insisted that there was none, wanting to hoard it and sell it at a high price. In the first half of this year, in my hometown in the countryside, there were still grain speculation merchants taking advantage of the farmers' difficulties during the "lean season" to sell grain at high prices.
    The government's strict suppression of grain speculation is really great for us working people. With the state controlling grain, it can supply urban and rural people in a planned way, and rice prices will never fluctuate again.

    Sun Xiaoman Does Not Sell Surplus Grain to Unscrupulous Merchants
    Zhu Xianben
    Sun Xiaoman is the militia squad leader of Sixia Village, Sixia Township, Longyou County, Zhejiang Province. This year, his family's crops had a bumper harvest. In addition to public grain and food grain, there were more than 1,000 *jin* of rice left. Some time ago, local speculative grain merchants used illegal means of raising prices to pre-purchase 600 *jin* of late rice from him.
    In early November, the state grain purchasing station in Sixia Village publicized to the farmers the benefits of selling surplus grain to the state for the country and the farmers. Sun Xiaoman recalled the bitter days when his father and son generations were exploited by landlords in the old society, with "no tile above and no inch of land below," and the various kinds of help the People's Government had given him after liberation. He felt that he should not have sold grain to the unscrupulous merchants in order to greedily seek a little petty advantage instead of selling the grain to the state. He also thought that in 1946, he had painstakingly raised a pig and sold it for the price of 700 *jin* of rice, but the money was only enough to buy 400 *jin* of rice after it had been in the house for three days. Since liberation, prices have been very stable, which is one of the benefits of the state controlling grain. He thought: Selling grain to unscrupulous merchants, allowing them to speculate and profiteer, is like "lifting a rock to crush your own feet."
    After he understood these principles, he immediately returned the money to the speculative grain merchant. Then, he sold 1,100 *jin* of surplus grain to the state. Under his influence, several other farmers in the village also sold more than 5,000 *jin* of surplus grain that had already been pre-sold to the grain merchant to the state.

### 取缔粮食投机，保障国家建设

    取缔粮食投机，保障国家建设
    不能把粮食给奸商拿去投机倒把
    方学金　讲
    我是辽东省西安县管家村的农民。前些日子，我卖给粮商两石豆子，每斤比卖给供销合作社多得一百五十元。当时心里很高兴。
    豆子还没有送去，我村党支部书记于忠厚由县里开会回来了。他给我们讲了国家在过渡时期的总路线和总任务。接着大家进行了讨论，并且参观了展览会。在展览会上，我看到了在社会主义社会，我们农民也能使用机器种地，乡村也修起发电站，成立图书馆等美好的远景，心里可真亮堂。
    在展览会上，我还看到一张画，画的是把粮食卖给粮商，粮商就拿去投机倒把的事情。当时我就想，我把豆子卖给粮商，这不是不对了吗？但是，我还有些想不通，明摆着的事：把两石豆子卖给粮商就多得几万元。在讨论会上，我就把这个问题提出来，大家可就讨论起来了。有人说，把两石豆子卖给粮商多卖几万元钱，可是粮商拿这些豆子去投机倒把，说不定能赚几倍的钱。如果大家都这么干，粮商掌握了粮食，哄抬物价，买什么东西都要贵。再说工人吃粮食贵了，织出布的成本就高，布的价钱就贵，吃亏的还是我们农民。曹运亮说：
  “咱不能光看眼前的利益，应当往远看。咱们把粮食卖给国家，支援国家工业建设，工人可以给我们造出新式农具、拖拉机，帮助咱们发展生产。要是把粮食卖给粮商，让粮商拿去投机倒把，剥削人民，破坏国家建设，我们还得过扛大活的生活！”
    这些话给我很大教育。我下了决心，不扔掉长远的大利益，决定把粮食卖给国家。我不仅要把这两石豆子送到供销合作社去，还要把其余要卖的粮食全卖给国家。粮商再多给多少钱，我也坚决不卖给他！
          （辽东人民广播电台驻西安记者组记）
    一颗粮食也不卖给投机奸商
    艾光荣　讲
    我叫艾光荣，是湖南省汉寿县文武乡的农民。以前，我对于应该把粮食卖给国家，不卖给投机商人的道理是不懂的。心想，卖给谁有什么关系，多卖几个钱是真的。
    最近，我听了国家过渡时期总路线的报告，心里可亮堂了。粮食叫奸商拿去投机倒把，对农民的害处可实在大。就拿我们乡的事来说吧。在今年青黄不接的时候，我们乡的一个奸商，用两千多元一斤的高价卖米给缺粮户。这个奸商还说：“我的娃娃服我抱，你们爱要不要，卖三千元一斤，你们也得听我的。”幸亏政府始终用七百元一斤的价钱供应我们大米，才解决了缺粮户的困难。我永远忘不了奸商抬高粮价给我们农民的痛苦，更忘不了人民政府对我们的扶助。因此，我坚决不卖给奸商一颗粮食，我要把我的一千二百斤余粮全部卖给国家。我们挨家住的刘德生、夏正爱等六户农民，也准备把五千八百斤余粮一概都卖给国家，支援国家经济建设。　（汤龙宝、赵玉兰记）
    我们要认清粮商的“奸白脸”
    李成均　讲
    今年中秋节前后，我们江苏省新沂县黄墩乡的麦价，被粮食投机奸商从一斤五百二十元抬高到五百六十元，向南顶到瓦窑，就抬高到六百二十元。有的有麦种的人贪几千块钱的“便宜”把麦种卖给投机粮贩子，需要麦种的人却不能用合理的价钱买到麦种。那时候，大家对粮食投机奸商恨得咬牙切齿，希望政府稳住粮价，严办这些坏东西。
    有的农民看着奸商的价钱高，就想贪点小便宜把粮食卖给奸商，他们还不知道把粮食卖给谁对咱们农民有好处。拿今年青黄不接的时候来说吧，那时候，粮食投机奸商不顾农民死活，还从灾区里向外偷运粮食。政府从东北几千里路以外，花了很多运费把粮食运到新沂，每斤玉米比当地粮价便宜七十元。我们新沂县的农民都亲眼看到政府把救灾的粮食从新沂运到宿迁，那样一小车一小车要花多少运费呀，可是到宿迁卖给灾民，比新沂每斤还要便宜二十元。粮食卖给谁好，卖给谁坏，我们一定要认清。看奸商出的价钱高，不把粮食卖给国家，到你需要粮食的时候，你就要出更高的价钱去买。奸商哄抬粮价，别的物价跟着涨了，咱们农民也要吃亏。把粮食卖给国家，国家不但随时供应我们需要的粮食，还能保证城市人民有饭吃，大家都能安心搞建设。将来，我们才能过社会主义社会的幸福生活。　（赵力田等记）
    拥护政府严格取缔粮食投机
    王珍祥　讲
    我是湖南省长沙市私营万象针织厂的女工，我最近听到政府要严格取缔粮食投机，高兴得不得了。
    我过去为了买米吃，不知吃了粮食投机奸商多少苦头。在解放前，工人到月底、年底有了几个钱，米就涨了价，一个月的工资只能买到两、三斗米。一九四九年刚解放的时候，有一次，我到粮商那里去买米，粮商看到买米的人多，就把门一关不卖了。明明米店里的米堆积如山，粮商却硬说没有，想囤着卖高价钱。今年上半年，在我的老家的农村里，还有粮食投机奸商趁农民“青黄不接”的困难高价卖粮。
    政府要严格取缔粮食投机，这对我们劳动人民实在太好了。国家掌握了粮食，就能有计划地供应城乡人民，米价就再也不会波动了。
                                （孙建民记）
    孙小曼不把余粮卖给奸商
    朱先本
    孙小曼是浙江省龙游县寺下乡寺下村的民兵班长。今年他家的庄稼丰收了，除了公粮、吃粮，还剩一千多斤稻谷。前些日子，当地投机粮商用抬价的非法手段向他预购了六百斤晚稻。
    十一月初，寺下村的国家购粮站向农民宣传了把余粮卖给国家对国家、对农民的好处。孙小曼回想起在旧社会里，他们父子两代受地主剥削，家中 “上无片瓦、下无寸土”的苦日子，和解放后人民政府对自己的各种帮助，心里直觉得自己不该为了贪图眼前一点小便宜，便不把粮食卖给国家。他还想到在一九四六年，辛辛苦苦养了一口猪，以七百斤稻谷的价钱卖出去，钱在家里放了三天，就只能买到四百斤稻谷。解放后，物价一直很稳定，这就是国家掌握粮食的一个好处。他想：把粮食卖给奸商，让他们拿去投机倒把，就是“自搬石头自压脚”。
    他想通了这些道理以后，就立即把钱退还了投机粮商。接着，他就把一千一百斤余粮卖给了国家。在他的影响下，村里另外几户农民也把已经预售给粮商的五千多斤余粮卖给了国家。
