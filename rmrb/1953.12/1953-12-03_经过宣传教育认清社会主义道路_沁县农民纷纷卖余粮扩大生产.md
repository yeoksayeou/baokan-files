    After Propaganda and Education, Recognizing the Socialist Road
    Qin County Farmers Actively Sell Surplus Grain to Expand Production
    Party organizations and government cadres of the Chinese Communist Party in Qin County, Shanxi Province, vigorously educated farmers on the socialist road during grain purchases, organized farmers to expand production, and promoted farmers to sell a large amount of surplus grain to the state.
    When Qin County began purchasing grain this autumn, some farmers had thoughts such as waiting for prices to rise and being reluctant to sell, and were unwilling to actively sell surplus grain. In response to the above situation, cadres in various parts of Qin County focused on the following two tasks: First, they organized a strong propaganda force to universally educate farmers on the socialist road, publicizing the significance of state grain purchases and the benefits to farmers; second, they used methods such as introducing the experience of agricultural production cooperatives in increasing production to stimulate farmers' enthusiasm for production, and specifically organized and helped farmers to expand production.
    After propaganda and mobilization, farmers in various places actively sold their surplus grain to the state to support national economic construction, and used the money from selling grain to purchase various means of production to expand production. For example, Cao Chunmei, a farmer in Nanli Township, said after listening to the cadres' propaganda: "The Communist Party led us to fight Japan, carry out land reform, resist US aggression and aid Korea, and engage in mutual aid production; none of these were not for our sake. Now the government is calling on us to sell surplus grain to support national construction, how can this be wrong? If we keep the grain at home, it won't increase by a single grain. If we sell it to the state and turn dead money into living money, it will support national industrial construction, ensure price stability, and invest in expanding production, all of which are beneficial to us." After returning home, he held a family meeting and decided to sell 750 jin of wheat and 300 jin of autumn grain to the state. After Shangguan Village publicized the high-yield experience of Li Fuyun's agricultural production cooperative in producing three dan of grain per mu and Yang Manfu's five mu of corn land producing forty dan of grain, the old man Zhang Shuiming said: "Our livestock are not good, and there is little fertilizer, so each mu of land only produces a little more than one dan of grain. We will also change to good livestock and buy more fertilizer, and strive to produce more grain next year." With the specific help of the township cadres, he sold surplus grain and exchanged it for good livestock and bought 300 jin of bean cake. After Nanli Township publicized the direction of agricultural cooperativization and the experience of the Shihuo Agricultural Production Cooperative in increasing production, mutual aid groups such as Wen Mingxiu and Wen Yanlin made plans to sell grain to expand production in order to lay the foundation for running agricultural production cooperatives next year. Wen Mingxiu and Wen Yanlin's two mutual aid groups planned to sell more than 70 dan of surplus grain and buy a cow, two mules, four carts, and twenty pigs. Under the leadership of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups, this township has sold more than 15,000 jin of surplus grain and bought more than 9 million yuan of means of production. Nan Dishui Township has sold more than 20,000 jin of surplus grain. The Li Qingshui Agricultural Production Cooperative in this township sold 4,700 jin of surplus grain, most of which was used to invest in expanding production. Many farmers happily said: "The government calls on us to sell surplus grain, which is beneficial and honorable. Exchanging it for farm tools and livestock guarantees increased production next year."

    经过宣传教育认清社会主义道路
    沁县农民纷纷卖余粮扩大生产
    山西省沁县各地中共党组织和政府干部，在购粮中大力向农民进行社会主义道路的教育，组织农民扩大生产，推动农民把大批余粮卖给了国家。
    沁县今秋开始收购粮食时，一部分农民存在着看涨惜售等思想，不肯积极出卖余粮。沁县各地干部，针对上述情况，着重进行了以下两项工作：第一、组织强大的宣传力量，向农民普遍进行社会主义道路的教育，宣传国家收购粮食的意义和对农民的好处；第二、用介绍农业生产合作社增产经验等办法，启发农民的生产积极性，并具体组织和帮助农民扩大生产。
    经过宣传动员，各地农民纷纷把余粮卖给国家，支援国家经济建设，并将卖粮得到的钱，购买各种生产资料，扩大生产。如南里乡农民曹春梅听了干部的宣传后说：“共产党领导咱们打日本，进行土地改革，抗美援朝，互助生产，没有一件不是为咱们打算；现在政府号召咱们卖余粮支援国家建设，这还能有错吗？咱把粮食放在家里一粒也不能多出来，要是卖给国家，把死财变成活财，既支持了国家工业建设，保证了物价稳定，又可以投资扩大生产，都是对咱们有好处。”他回家召开了个家庭会议，决定把七百五十斤小麦和三百斤秋粮卖给国家。上官村宣传了李富云农业生产合作社每亩地产粮三石和杨满富五亩玉米地产粮四十石的丰产经验后，张水明老汉说：“咱的牲口不好，肥料也少，因此每亩地只打一石多粮。咱也换个好牲口，多买些肥料，争取明年多打粮食。”在乡干部具体帮助下，他卖出余粮换了一个好牲口，买了三百斤豆饼。南里乡宣传了农业合作化的方向和石火农业生产合作社增产的经验后，温明秀、温彦林等互助组为了给明年办农业生产合作社打基础，都订了卖粮扩大生产的计划。温明秀、温彦林两个互助组计划卖七十多石余粮，买一头牛、两头骡子、四辆大车、二十只猪。在农业生产合作社和互助组的带动下，这个乡已卖出一万五千多斤余粮，买了九百多万元的生产资料。南底水乡已卖出余粮二万多斤，该乡李庆水农业生产合作社卖出余粮四千七百斤，大部用来投资扩大生产。许多农民高兴地说：“政府号召卖余粮，有利又光荣，换回农具和牲口，明年增产有保证。”（张毓英）
