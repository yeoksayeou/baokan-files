Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd: According to the Vietnam News Agency on December 21st, the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party recently issued a communiqué on the adoption of the Land Reform Program. The full text of the communiqué is as follows:

The Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party and the First National Cadre Conference were held in November this year.

The Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party discussed the land policy to be presented at the Party's First National Cadre Conference.

After discussing the domestic and international situation, the Party's First National Cadre Conference adopted a decision of great significance: to gradually and cautiously implement land reform in accordance with a well-thought-out plan, in order to realize the slogan of "land to the tillers," improve the living standards of farmers, enrich the people's strength, and promote the production competition and the war of resistance.

The Fifth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee discussed the draft land policy formulated in accordance with the Party's Land Reform Program formulated by the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee at the beginning of this year. The Party's First National Cadre Conference made some additions to this draft and finally adopted this draft as the official Land Reform Program of the Vietnamese Labor Party.

The Party's First National Cadre Conference unanimously adopted President Ho Chi Minh's report on the current situation and the tasks of land reform, and Comrade Truong Chinh, General Secretary of the Vietnamese Labor Party, on the objectives, objects, scope, and content of the Party's land policy, as well as the methods and plans for implementing land reform in Vietnam.

At the conference, President Ho Chi Minh put forward two central tasks for all the people and the Party in 1954: to advance the war of resistance and to implement land reform.

Advancing the war of resistance is the central task of the whole country. Due to different local conditions, the movement to mobilize the masses to carry out land reform and to reduce rent and interest in coordination with all war resistance work can only be carried out in areas where conditions are ripe as designated by the Party and the government.

President Ho Chi Minh said: Our strength lies in the millions of working farmers, who, under the leadership of our Party and government, are willing to rise up and defeat feudal and colonial rule. If this powerful force is well organized and properly led, it can accomplish all undertakings and crush colonialism and feudalism.

President Ho Chi Minh also said: The key to our victory in the war of resistance lies in consolidating and expanding the national united front, consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, consolidating the people's power, consolidating and rapidly expanding the army, consolidating the Party, and consolidating its leadership in various activities. Only by mobilizing the masses to carry out land reform can we accomplish these tasks.

The Central Committee of the Party calls on all Party members and all the people to make their greatest efforts to carry out President Ho Chi Minh's orders, victoriously implement the great land reform, and advance the war of resistance until final victory.

    越南劳动党中央委员会
    发表关于通过土地改革纲领公报
    【新华社二十二日讯】据越南通讯社二十一日讯：越南劳动党中央委员会在最近发表关于通过土地改革纲领的公报。公报全文如下：
    越南劳动党中央委员会第五次全体会议和第一次全国干部会议是今年十一月举行的。
    越南劳动党中央委员会第五次全体会议讨论了要在党的第一次全国干部会议上提出的土地政策。
    越南劳动党第一次全国干部会议在讨论了国内外形势以后，通过了具有重大意义的决定：将按照周密的计划，逐步地、谨慎地实行土地改革，以便实现“耕者有其田”的口号，提高农民的生活水平，充实人民力量，推进生产竞赛和推进抗战。
    党的中央委员会第五次全体会议讨论了根据今年年初的党中央委员会第四次全体会议制订的党的土地改革纲领所拟订的土地政策草案。党的第一次全国干部会议对这个草案作了一些补充，最后通过这个草案作为越南劳动党的正式的土地改革纲领。
    党的第一次全国干部会议一致通过胡志明主席关于目前局势与土地改革的任务的报告和越南劳动党总书记长征同志关于党的土地政策的目的、对象、范围与内容及在越南实行土地改革的方法、计划的报告。
    在会议上，胡志明主席提出了全体人民和党在一九五四年的两个中心任务：推进抗战和实行土地改革。
    推进抗战是全国的中心任务。由于各个地方的情况不同，配合一切抗战工作进行的动员群众实行土地改革和实行减租减息的运动，只能在党与政府所指定的条件成熟的地区进行。
    胡志明主席说：我们的力量就在千百万劳动农民身上，他们在我们党和政府领导下，是愿意起来打垮封建与殖民统治的。假使很好地组织起来并有正确领导的话，这股强大的力量是可以完成一切事业的，是能够粉碎殖民主义和封建主义的。
    胡志明主席又说：我们抗战胜利的关键在于巩固和扩大民族统一战线、巩固工农联盟、巩固人民政权、巩固和迅速扩大军队、巩固党和巩固它在各种活动中的领导权。只有通过动员群众实行土地改革，我们才能完成这些任务。
    党的中央委员会号召全体党员和全体人民作最大的努力来执行胡志明主席的命令，胜利地实行伟大的土地改革，并推进抗战，直到取得最后胜利。
