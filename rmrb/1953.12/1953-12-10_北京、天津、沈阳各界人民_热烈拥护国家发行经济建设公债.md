    People from All Walks of Life in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shenyang
    Warmly Support the Issuance of National Economic Construction Bonds
    People from all walks of life in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shenyang warmly support the Central People's Government's issuance of the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds.
    The people of Beijing showed immense excitement and unanimously supported this measure by the state upon hearing the news that the state would issue economic construction bonds. Liu Laifu, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, said: "The workers of Beijing fully support the government's measure to issue the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds. After studying the general line and general tasks of the state during the transition period, the workers of Beijing have greatly enhanced their sense of responsibility and enthusiasm as builders of the nation, and are working selflessly for the industrialization of the country. We are very clear that construction requires funds, and our funds are accumulated by ourselves. The issuance of construction bonds is one of the important and regular methods for the state to accumulate funds. Under the care of the Party and the People's Government, the lives of our workers have gradually improved. Many workers use savings to give their saved money to the state bank for construction investment. This time, in the form of construction bonds, the surplus is more directly used in the cause of national construction. Our Beijing workers must unite with people from all walks of life and actively subscribe." The labor models of the Xinhua Printing Factory, who completed their annual production plan by the end of November, discussed the significance of the state's issuance of economic construction bonds. Sun Shuling, a labor model and old worker at the factory, said: "Machines and factories need money to build. This issuance of bonds is to build more and faster machines and build large factories to realize socialist industrialization as soon as possible. We should enthusiastically purchase bonds." Liu Dezhen, a national labor model and director of the steam turbine workshop of the Shijingshan Power Plant, who achieved production achievements by learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, said: "We must not only learn the advanced science and technology of the Soviet Union, but also learn the spirit of the Soviet people's love for their motherland, and subscribe to bonds to accelerate the construction of the motherland." The farmers of Zhang Guozhuang, who have sold more than 40,000 jin of surplus grain to the state, unanimously expressed their support when discussing the state's issuance of bonds. This year, the Czechoslovak Republic donated a tractor to them, which enabled their whole village to have a bumper harvest and greatly increased production. Hu Baoxian, a member of the agricultural production cooperative, said: "Tractors are good, but we can't always rely on brother countries to send them! We have to make our own machines. This issuance of bonds by the state can make our country stronger and enable us to have tractors as soon as possible." Some members of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce held a discussion and unanimously supported the issuance of national construction bonds. Director Fu Huating spoke from the perspective of the improvement of the living standards of the people of Beijing and the profits gained by industry and commerce in recent years about the relationship between the issuance of bonds and the state and the people. He said: "The issuance of construction bonds is beneficial to the country and also beneficial to individuals." He called on the industrial and commercial circles to actively subscribe. At the meeting, they also studied how to further assist the government in doing a good job in publicity.
    Liu Changfu, a special-class labor model in Tianjin and director of the Fourth Branch of the state-owned Tianjin Steel Plant, said: "Issuing construction bonds can increase a large amount of funds for the country. I myself will not only take the lead in buying bonds actively, but also actively publicize and mobilize everyone to buy them, so that our national economic construction can proceed faster and socialist industrialization can arrive sooner." Li Zhenjiang and Li Shuqin, workers in the textile workshop of the Dongya Woolen Mill, were very excited when they heard the news of the issuance of construction bonds. They said: "This is something that completely conforms to the interests of all the people. We have personally experienced the benefits that the People's Victory Discount Bonds issued by the state in 1950 brought to the people. Roads are being built one after another, there are more and more buses, prices are stable, production is developing, and even the machines that haven't been running in our factory for decades have started running." Zhang Guofan, Vice President of Tianjin University and Deputy Director of the Tianjin Branch of the China Democratic League, said: "If our country wants to realize socialist industrialization, especially to build heavy industry first, it must have a large amount of funds. In addition to mainly relying on increasing production and practicing economy, the purchase of bonds by the people of the whole country is also an important source. Now the people's living standards have generally improved. Buying bonds with the money saved can make a great contribution and powerfully support the country's economic construction." Li Zhuchen, Chairman of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce and Chairman of the Tianjin Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said: "At a time when our country is entering large-scale economic construction, the issuance of economic construction bonds is very necessary and timely. The Soviet people have been continuously purchasing such bonds since the first five-year plan, which has powerfully supported the country's socialist construction. We should also actively purchase bonds, especially private industrialists and businessmen should seize this opportunity to contribute to the country." This year, the business of industry and commerce has generally been very good. Our Tianjin industrial and commercial circles should prepare to actively purchase national economic construction bonds and strive to play an exemplary role in the national industrial and commercial circles. After reading the news of the issuance of construction bonds, the members of the reading group of Anrenli residents in Potaizhuang, the seventh district of Tianjin, expressed their support. Zhou Xiuwen, a family member of a construction worker, said: "People's lives are much richer than before. If we save some money to buy bonds and let the government build big factories for us to produce things, our lives will be even better!"
    Now, the nationally renowned labor models in Shenyang, Ma Hengchang, Jiang Wanshou, Tian Guiying, Su Changyou, etc., have all expressed their support after seeing the news that the government is about to issue the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds. Ma Hengchang said: "In the past few years, the living standards of workers have been continuously improving. If each of us uses a portion of our surplus money to buy bonds, we can accumulate a large amount of funds for the country, which will greatly help the development of industry. Our working class has played a leading role in restoring production, resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, and increasing production and practicing economy. Now we must also take the lead in actively subscribing to bonds." Jiang Guochen, the foreman of the third work section of the fifth workshop of the National Model Factory - Factory 53, said after seeing this news: "To transition to socialism, we must develop heavy industry and manufacture a large number of machines. This of course requires a large amount of funds. Our workers' incomes have increased in the past few years, and we can save some of it and invest it in the construction of the motherland." Tang Yong'an, a young worker at the Shenyang Third Machine Tool Plant, said that he would use the 30% bonus he earned in November to buy bonds, and will continue to work hard to overfulfill the plan and use the extra bonus to buy bonds. Many workers in factories such as the Shenyang Low-Voltage Switch Factory and the Northeast State-Owned Seventh Rubber Factory have also expressed their willingness to use the practical action of actively subscribing to bonds to accelerate national economic construction. The nine people's representatives elected in Hengyang Street, Heping District, Shenyang City, after the general election, held a representative group meeting on the evening after seeing the news of the state's issuance of construction bonds in the newspaper. At the meeting, they seriously discussed the issue of the government's issuance of the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds, and unanimously expressed their firm support. Gong Tianmin, Chairman of the Shenyang Federation of Industry and Commerce, and Lu Guangji, Vice Chairman, both expressed their support for the government's issuance of bonds. Gong Tianmin said: "Our Shenyang industrial and commercial circles will definitely actively subscribe to the construction bonds issued by the government. Our country's economic construction is developing by leaps and bounds. The workers have completed huge and exciting projects such as seamless steel pipe plants and large rolling steel mills. Our industrial and commercial circles must also contribute to the effort, accumulating many minor contributions into a major one, and invest a large amount of funds in economic construction to realize national industrialization as soon as possible." Lu Guangji said: "The Northeast has issued bonds twice in the past, and we have subscribed to them. The facts of the past few years have proved that it is not only beneficial to national construction, but also beneficial to individuals, and it also promotes patriotism. It is really a win-win situation. This time the government is issuing construction bonds, we will definitely actively subscribe to them."

    北京、天津、沈阳各界人民
    热烈拥护国家发行经济建设公债
    北京市、天津市和沈阳市各界人民热烈拥护中央人民政府发行一九五四年国家经济建设公债。
    北京人民在听到国家将要发行经济建设公债的消息后，表现了无比的兴奋，并一致拥护国家的这一措施。北京市总工会副主席刘莱夫说：我们北京市的职工完全拥护政府发行一九五四年国家经济建设公债的措施。我们北京市的职工在学习了国家在过渡时期的总路线、总任务以后，大大提高了国家建设者的责任感和积极性，忘我地在为国家工业化而劳动着。我们非常清楚，要建设就要有资金，我们的资金是靠我们自己积累起来的。发行建设公债正是国家积累资金的重要的和经常的方法之一。在党和人民政府的关怀之下，我们职工的生活已逐步获得改善，不少职工用储蓄的方法，把节省的钱交给国家银行用作建设投资，这次用建设公债的形式，更直接地把节余用到国家建设的事业中去。我们北京市的职工一定要团结各阶层人民，踊跃认购。十一月底就完成了全年生产计划的新华印刷厂的劳动模范们，座谈了国家发行经济建设公债的意义。该厂劳动模范、老工人孙述凌说：“机器、厂房都是要钱来建设的。这次发行公债，就是为了能更多更快地造机器、盖大工厂，早日实现社会主义工业化。咱们应该热烈地购买公债。”以学习苏联先进经验获得生产成就的全国劳动模范、石景山发电厂汽机场主任刘德珍说：“我们不仅要学习苏联先进的科学技术，还要学习苏联人民热爱祖国的精神，认购公债来加速地建设祖国。”已将四万多斤余粮卖给国家的张郭庄农民，他们在座谈国家发行公债时，一致表示拥护。今年捷克斯洛伐克人民共和国赠送了他们一部拖拉机，使他们全村获得了丰收，产量提高很多。农业生产合作社社员扈宝先说：“拖拉机是好，可是我们也不能老靠兄弟国家送呀！我们也得要自己制造机器才行。国家这次发行公债，就是能使我们的国家更加富强，使我们尽快有拖拉机用。”北京市工商业联合会的部分委员举行了座谈会，一致拥护国家建设公债的发行。傅华亭主任委员从这几年来北京人民生活水平的提高及工商业所获得的利润说到发行公债对国家对人民的关系。他说：建设公债的发行，对国家有利，对个人也有利。他号召工商界要积极认购。在会上他们并研究了如何进一步协助政府作好宣传工作。
    天津市特等劳动模范、国营天津钢厂四分场主任刘长福说：发行建设公债就能给国家增加大量资金，我自己不但要积极带头买公债，还要积极宣传，动员大家都来购买，使我们的国家经济建设进行得更快，使社会主义工业化早日到来。东亚毛织厂纺织车间工人李振江、李淑琴，听到发行建设公债的消息非常兴奋。他们说：这是完全符合全体人民利益的事，我们已经亲身体验到国家在一九五○年发行人民胜利折实公债所带给人们的好处，马路一条条的修筑起来，公共汽车越来越多，物价稳定，生产发展，连我们厂里几十年没开动的车也开动起来了。天津大学副校长、中国民主同盟天津市支部副主任委员张国藩说：我们国家要实现社会主义工业化，特别是首先要建设重工业，就非有大量资金不可，资金的积累除了主要靠增产节约外，全国人民购买公债也是一个重要来源，现在人民生活普遍提高，把节余储蓄的钱购买公债，就能集腋成裘，有力地支援国家的经济建设。天津市工商业联合会主任委员、中国民主建国会天津市分会主任委员李烛尘说：在我们国家进入大规模经济建设的时候，发行经济建设公债是非常必要和及时的，苏联人民从第一个五年计划开始，就不断购买这种公债，有力地支持了国家的社会主义建设，我们也应该踊跃购买公债，特别是私营工商业者更应抓住这个机会，为国家尽一份力量。今年工商业一般生意都很好，我们天津市工商业界要准备踊跃购买国家经济建设公债，争取在全国工商界中起模范作用。天津市第七区炮台庄安仁里居民读报小组读了发行建设公债的消息以后，组员们都表示拥护。建筑工人家属周秀文说：现在人们的生活比以前富裕多了，要是节省点钱买了公债，让政府再给咱们去建设大工厂，生产东西，咱们的生活就更好啦！
    现在沈阳的全国闻名的劳动模范马恒昌、姜万寿、田桂英、苏长有等看到政府即将发行一九五四年国家经济建设公债的消息后，都一致表示拥护。马恒昌说：几年来工人的生活水平不断提高，我们每个人把多余的一部分钱用来买公债，就能为国家积累很大一笔资金，这对发展工业有很大帮助。我们工人阶级在恢复生产、抗美援朝和增产节约中都起了带头作用，现在我们也要带头踊跃认购公债。全国模范工厂——五三工厂第五车间三工段工段长姜国臣看到这个消息后说：要过渡到社会主义，就要发展重工业和制造大量机器。这当然要大量的资金。我们工人几年来收入增加了，很可以节约一些下来，投入到祖国建设中去。沈阳第三机床厂青年工人唐永安表示要把十一月份超额百分之三十的奖金拿来买公债，并将继续努力争取超额完成计划，把超额奖金用来购买公债。沈阳低压开关厂、东北国营第七橡胶厂等工厂的许多工人，也都表示要用积极认购公债的实际行动，来加速国家经济建设。沈阳市和平区衡阳街普选后当选的九名人民代表，在报纸上看到国家发行建设公债的消息后，当晚召开了代表小组会议，会上认真地讨论了政府发行一九五四年国家经济建设公债的问题，并一致表示坚决拥护。沈阳市工商业联合会主任委员巩天民和副主任委员卢广绩都表示拥护政府发行公债。巩天民说：我们沈阳市工商界一定踊跃认购政府发行的建设公债。我们国家的经济建设正在飞跃地发展着，工人们已经完成了无缝钢管厂、大型轧钢厂等十分振奋人心的巨大工程，我们工商界也要贡献一份力量，积腋成裘，把大量资金投入经济建设，早日实现国家工业化。卢广绩说：过去东北曾发行过两次公债，我们都认购了。几年来的事实证明，不仅对国家建设有利，对个人也有利，而且还发扬了爱国主义精神，真是一举两得。这次政府发行建设公债，我们一定踊跃认购。
