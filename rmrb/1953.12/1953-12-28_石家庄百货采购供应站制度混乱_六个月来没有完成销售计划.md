    Shijiazhuang Department Store Purchasing and Supply Station: Chaotic System, Sales Plan Unfulfilled for Six Months
    The Shijiazhuang Purchasing and Supply Station of the Hebei Provincial Company of the China Department Store Company has failed to complete its sales plan for six months due to its extremely chaotic management system. This has resulted in shortages of goods in stores across the region and has also affected the completion of grain purchase tasks. Meanwhile, the supply station's warehouse is stocked with over 39 billion yuan worth of goods, unable to reach the masses.
    The main reason for the above situation is the serious bureaucratic style of the station's leading cadres, who neither understand the actual work situation nor conduct in-depth inspections. For example, Zhang Yuzhou, the deputy section chief of the Storage and Transportation Section, reported to the manager at the section chiefs' joint meeting at the end of October: "The Storage and Transportation Section has no problems. All incoming goods have been entered into the accounts, and all goods that should have been sent have been sent." However, it was later discovered that 5.9 billion yuan worth of newly arrived goods had not been entered into the accounts, and 4 billion yuan worth of winter goods had been stockpiled for more than two months without being sent out. In October, in order to promote the sale of a large number of goods stockpiled at this supply station, the Hebei Provincial Department Store Company convened a provincial department store supply meeting. Gai Zhixin, the deputy section chief of the Business Section who attended the meeting, only stated that 16 billion yuan worth of goods were to be supplied to stores across the region. The section chief of the Provincial Company's Business Section repeatedly asked if there were any other goods, and he always said: "There are goods, but they have all been transferred out..." However, later inspections revealed that 20 billion yuan worth of new winter goods urgently needed by markets across the region were stockpiled in the warehouse. The station's storage, transportation, and allocation systems are also unsound, and some business and management personnel are irresponsible with state property. For example, in September, the Business Section issued 200 transfer slips for winter goods such as flannel shirts, which were all stockpiled in the hands of Wang Jinshuan, the knitwear custodian. When stores across the region sent letters urging delivery, the Business Section inquired with the Storage and Transportation Section, who in turn asked the custodian, Wang Jinshuan, who said: "All the slips that were given have been sent out." It was not until November that it was discovered that the 200 transfer slips for flannel shirts had been stockpiled in Wang Jinshuan's bedding for two months. This one instance alone resulted in the stockpiling of more than 4,000 dozens of flannel shirts and many winter goods, causing shortages in markets across the region. In June, the Business Section lost the supply contracts for nine stores all at once. When people sent letters urging delivery, they insisted that no contract had been signed, resulting in the supply station stockpiling 900 bolts of mosquito net yarn alone. As for phenomena such as sending the wrong goods and discrepancies between goods and accounts, they occur constantly. This serious situation has not yet attracted the attention of the station's leading cadres. (Zhang Ziren)

    石家庄百货采购供应站制度混乱
    六个月来没有完成销售计划
    中国百货公司河北省公司石家庄采购供应站，由于经营管理制度十分混乱，六个月来未完成销售计划。这样就造成各地商店商品脱销，也影响购粮任务的完成，在供应站的仓库内，却积压着三百九十多亿元的商品，不能与群众见面。
    造成上述情况的主要原因是该站领导干部有严重的官僚主义作风，既不了解实际工作情况，也不进行深入检查。比如储运科副科长张玉州在十月份月终的科长联席会议上向经理汇报：“储运科没啥问题，来的货都报进了账，该发的货都发走了。”但后来发现有五十九亿元的新到货没进账，有价值四十亿元的冬季商品压了两个多月还没有发出。十月份河北省百货公司为了推销这个供应站积压的大批商品，召开了全省百货供应会议，该站参加会议的业务科副科长盖志新只提出有一百六十亿元的货要往各地商店供应。省公司业务科长一再追问还有没有货，他都说：“货是有，都调出去了……”。但后来检查还有各地市场迫切需要的二百亿元的新进冬季商品积压在仓库里。该站的储运和调拨制度也不健全，有些业务和管理人员对国家财产不负责任。比如九月份业务科先后开出了二百张调拨绒衣等冬季商品的传票，都在针织品保管员王金拴手里积压起来。到各地商店来信催货时，业务科询问储运科，储运科去问保管员，保管员王金拴说：“给了传票的都发走了。”一直到十一月份才发现那二百张调拨绒衣的传票压在王金拴的被窝里已有两个月了，光这一次就积压了四千多打绒衣和许多冬季商品，造成各地市场的脱销。业务科在六月份一下就丢失了九个商店的供应合同，人家来信催货，还硬说没有订合同，结果供应站只蚊帐纱一项就积压了九百匹。至于发错商品，货账不符等现象更是不断发生。这种严重的情况至今还没有引起该站领导干部的重视。（张子仁）
