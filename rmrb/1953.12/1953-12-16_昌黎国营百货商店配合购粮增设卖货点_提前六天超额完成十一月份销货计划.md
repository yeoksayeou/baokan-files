Changli State-Owned Department Store Adds Sales Outlets to Cooperate with Grain Purchase, Exceeding November Sales Plan by Six Days

The Changli State-Owned Department Store in Hebei Province added sales outlets to cooperate with grain purchases, exceeding the November sales plan by six days.

The entire staff of the Changli State-Owned Department Store, in coordination with the state's purchase of grain and cotton, launched a comprehensive competition movement with the main content being actively organizing sales and ensuring the supply of materials. The industrial product sales plan for October was exceeded by 8.57%, and the November plan was completed six days ahead of schedule, exceeding it by 1.34%.

The sales methods of the Changli State-Owned Department Store are:

I. To cooperate with grain purchase, they put forward "Where grain is purchased, the supply of industrial products will follow!" increasing sales outlets and expanding sales area. First, the department store groups in Fengnan, Yutian, and Zunhua counties, which are under the jurisdiction of the grain and cotton purchasing areas, were identified as key sales areas. The manager took the lead, drawing eight key cadres including section chiefs and staff members, and went to the key groups to specifically help develop business. Then, forces were drawn from various administrative departments of the store, and five mobile industrial product sales teams were added in the purchasing areas of Funing, Lulong, Yahongqiao, Shiguozhuang, Fucun, and Jincun. Cooperating with grain purchase greatly expanded the sales area.

II. Implementing the business policy of "facing the countryside" with wholesale as the main focus, closely combining with cooperatives, delivering goods to the door, and facilitating farmers who sell grain to purchase industrial products in a timely manner. Each sales unit drew salespersons with rich sales experience to specialize in external liaison work, and in a method of division of labor and responsibility, promptly went deep into rural cooperatives to understand the supply situation to members, and provided cooperatives with all kinds of conveniences as much as possible. For example, preferential and priority rights were given to the purchase of goods, and short-term sales on credit were allowed when cooperatives had financial difficulties. They also introduced the sales methods and commodity storage methods of state-owned companies to the cooperatives, and helped the cooperatives prepare purchase plans and review list prices. Because of the good combination with cooperatives in various places, the goods supplied to cooperatives in the past accounted for about 25% of the store's wholesale volume, increasing to 27.52% in October, and increasing to 40.27% in mid-November, greatly enriching the material supply strength of the cooperatives. Contract business was also promoted to retail private merchants and peddlers engaged in urban and rural transportation. Chen Yong, a salesman from the Qian'an team, organized more than 30 small cloth stalls through the local Federation of Industry and Commerce, and all signed sales contracts, purchasing 1,550 bolts of cloth from the store. This not only facilitated the purchase of the vast number of farmers and consumers, but also developed wholesale business and expanded sales. In the past, the store's wholesale volume accounted for about 70% of the total sales volume, increasing to 78.53% by mid-November.

III. Grasping the principle of "selling, entering, and transporting simultaneously," and timely replenishing the source of goods to ensure the supply of materials. In addition to vigorously promoting sales, key cadres were also dispatched to Tianjin, Shanghai and locally to promptly purchase large quantities of stationery, sweaters, wool, rubber shoes and other commodities according to consumer needs. In November, because internal allocation was not timely enough, they seized the local and extra-regional direct purchases. The 1,500 kinds of commodities operated in the third quarter have increased to more than 2,300 kinds in more than two months. In mid-November alone, statistics showed an increase of 146 new commodities. Because they grasped the policy of "facing the countryside," they resolutely delegated power as long as the sales teams below could sell the goods, overcoming the store's past conservatism. In the competition movement, storage and transportation work was also strengthened. The time for goods to enter and leave the warehouse, which generally took more than ten days before the competition, was reduced to two days after the competition. All goods not exceeding one ton could be sent out on the same day, ensuring the timely supply of materials to the rural sales teams. The general fixed sales team increased by 200 to 300 kinds of commodities compared with the past, and the mobile team also increased from dozens of kinds of commodities in the past to 100 to 200 kinds of commodities.

IV. Improve the style of business in the store and increase business hours. "Continuous shift system" was implemented for both wholesale and retail, which not only increased business hours to facilitate customers' purchases and expand sales, but also allowed salespersons to get adequate rest, and further launched a competition in displaying goods, promoting and introducing more to customers, and selling more goods in the store. Some customers said: "The department store is much better than before. This is the attitude of serving the people!" (Shang Fuxiang)

    昌黎国营百货商店配合购粮增设卖货点
    提前六天超额完成十一月份销货计划
    河北省昌黎国营百货商店配合购粮，增设卖货点，提前六天超额完成十一月份销货计划。
    昌黎国营百货商店全体职工配合国家收购粮、棉，以积极组织推销，保证做好物资供应为主要内容，全面展开了竞赛运动。十月份工业品推销计划超额百分之八点五七，十一月份又提前六天超额百分之一点三四完成计划。
    昌黎国营百货商店的推销方法是：
    一、为配合购粮，提出“购粮到那里，工业品的供应工作就跟到那里！”增加卖货点、扩大销货面积。首先将粮棉收购区所属丰南、玉田、遵化三县百货小组确定为推销重点，以经理带头抽出科长、科员等八名主要干部，分赴重点小组具体帮助开展业务。随着在商店各行政部门抽出力量，在抚宁、卢龙、鸦洪桥、石果庄、福村、金村等收购区增设了五个推销工业品流动组。配合购粮大大扩大了销货面积。
    二、贯彻“面向农村”批发为主的经营方针，密切结合合作社，送货上门，便利了卖粮农民及时购买工业品。各推销单位都抽出富有推销经验的卖货员，专做对外联系业务，以分工负责的办法，及时地深入到农村合作社了解对社员的供应情况，尽量给合作社以各方面的便利。如购买货给予优待和优先权，合作社资金有困难，准予短期赊销。并向合作社介绍国营公司的推销方法与商品保管方法，帮助合作社编造要货计划、审定牌价。由于和各地合作社结合的好，过去供应合作社的货占商店批发额的百分之二十五左右，十月份增加到百分之二十七点五二，十一月中旬增到百分之四十点二七。大大充实了合作社的物资供应力量。对零售私商和从事城乡贩运的小贩也推行了合同业务，迁安小组的推销员陈勇通过当地工商联合会组织了三十多个小布摊，都签订了购销合同，由商店购布一千五百五十匹。这样既便利了广大农民与消费者的购买，又开展了批发业务，扩大了销货额。该店过去批发额占总销货的百分之七十左右，至十一月中旬增加到百分之七十八点五三。
    三、掌握“边销、边进、边运”的原则，及时充实了货源，保证了物资供应。除大力推销外，还派出主要干部根据消费者的需要，分赴天津、上海和当地及时购进大批文具、绒衣、毛线、胶鞋等商品。十一月份因内部调拨不够及时，就抓紧了当地和区外的直接购进，由三季度经营一千五百种商品，两个多月来增加到两千三百多种，仅十一月中旬统计就增加一百四十六种新商品。由于掌握了“面向农村”的方针，只要下面推销组能销的货，就坚决下放，克服了商店过去的保守思想。在竞赛运动中储运工作也加强了，由竞赛前商品出入库一般需十几天到竞赛后缩为两天，凡是不超过一吨的货，当天准能发出去，及时保证了农村推销组的物资供应，一般固定推销组比过去增加二、三百种商品，流动组也由过去带几十种商品增加到带一、二百种商品。
    四、改善门市经营作风，增加营业时间。批发、零售都实行了“连带上班制”，既增加了营业时间便利顾客购买，扩大了销货，同时售货员因得到了适当的休息，进一步在门市上展开了陈列商品、多向顾客宣传介绍、卖货多的竞赛。有的顾客说：“百货公司真比前强多了，这才是为人民服务的态度呢！”（尚福湘）
