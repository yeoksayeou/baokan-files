The Key Lies in Conducting Thorough General Line Education for Farmers
— Experience in Grain Procurement in Lingxia Village, Baicheng County
Luo Zicheng, Deputy Director of the Rural Work Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

Lingxia Village in the Tenth District of Baicheng County, Heilongjiang Province, had a bumper grain harvest this year. The village has 587 hectares of cultivated land, with an average yield of 4.99 *shi* per hectare (each *shi* is 570 *jin*).

From November 11th to 17th, we vigorously promoted the general line of the state's transition period in Lingxia Village. The ideological awareness of the villagers improved, and they voluntarily sold 1,550 *shi* of surplus grain to the state, accounting for 52% of the total output. At the same time, the farmers proposed a plan to expand production: adding three carts, buying 26 horses, 67 cattle, and 122 sheep, worth about 150 million yuan, accounting for 38% of the proceeds from selling grain. Through this publicity and education, the socialist consciousness of the farmers has been greatly improved, the enthusiasm for expanding production has increased, the mutual aid and cooperation organizations have been further consolidated and improved, and at the same time, the current work has been promoted. In short, it is a win-win-win situation: the grain purchase task is completed, the farmers' awareness is raised, and the village leadership level is also improved.

Before conducting the general line education, according to investigations and understanding, the farmers in Lingxia Village had the desire to sell grain and expand production, but some people still had some concerns and wrong ideas about selling grain. For example, some wealthy farmers did not need money now and wanted to sell when grain prices were high; some elderly people were afraid that selling grain would not be enough to eat next year; some women were worried that selling a large amount of surplus grain at one time would be inconvenient for spending money; some people wanted to sell grain to private merchants, and so on.

According to the ideological situation of the masses, we combined local specific examples to conduct in-depth publicity and education on the general line of the state's transition period.

First, through the typical examples of production improvement, the development of mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and the improvement of farmers' lives in this village in recent years, combined with the examples of high productivity and good lives of Soviet collective farmers, a comparison of the old and new paths was made to explain how the Party will lead farmers to take the socialist road during the transition period, and to guide farmers to look forward to the beautiful prospects of socialist society. For example, Comrade Ji Fengzhi, the village Party branch secretary, used the actual examples of this village to promote to the farmers: "At the time of land reform, our village had 56 horses, and now there are 124; there were 40 sheep, and now there are 261. At that time, they were all temporary mutual aid teams, now there are four agricultural production cooperatives, three permanent mutual aid teams, and one seasonal mutual aid team. Before the land reform, the village only harvested more than 1,000 *shi* of grain each year, and this year the whole village harvested more than 2,900 *shi* of grain. This is the result of everyone taking the new road under the leadership of Chairman Mao. In the future, we must follow the general line instructed by Chairman Mao, and the future will be even better. Ma Changxiu, a poor peasant in our village, believed in the Party's words and joined the mutual aid team after the land reform. Now he has joined the agricultural production cooperative, and from lacking food and clothing, his life is getting better year by year; farmer Zhang Fengchen did not believe in the Party's words and did not participate in the mutual aid and cooperation organizations. He went to the city to find easy work, and as a result, he sold his house, land, and horses, and still owed people money. He also regrets it now." The farmers were excited to hear him promote the general line in simple terms, linking the living people and events in the village, and said, "It strikes home!" Many farmers said: Living in the new China, you can rest assured and do it, it is right to follow the Communist Party and Chairman Mao!

Second, through the great achievements of the country's economic recovery and development in the past three years and the prospects of the first five-year plan, we publicized the benefits of national industrialization to farmers. The farmers were extremely excited to hear that our country could produce many cars and build many factories in five years. We also helped farmers analyze the benefits that the country's continuous reduction of industrial product prices and the increase of agricultural product prices have brought to farmers in recent years. For example, in one year during the puppet Manchukuo period, the son of a farmer, Shi Wanjin, in this village married a wife, and pulled five *shi* of sorghum to Baichengzi in exchange for a bolt of home-woven cloth (a face of twelve inches wide, folded twenty-five feet of wide cloth), now five *shi* of sorghum can buy 469 feet of medium-quality blue calico. Through these facts, the farmers' understanding of the worker-peasant alliance has been improved, the farmers have realized the benefits of national industrialization to farmers, and the enthusiasm of farmers to produce more grain to support national industrial construction has been encouraged. As an old farmer said: "Industry is like water, and we farmers are like fish. If the water is shallow, the fish cannot flop, and if the water is deep, the fish can grow up."

Third, through the actual examples of mutual aid and cooperation organizations in this village producing more grain, we publicized the benefits of agricultural collectivization. In the publicity, we also pointed out the glorious contributions that farmers have made to the country in recent years, pointed out the importance and bright prospects of agriculture during the national industrialization period, appropriately criticized the thinking of a few farmers who were not at ease with agricultural production, strengthened the confidence and determination of farmers to do a good job in mutual aid and cooperation, and at the mass meeting on patriotism day in the village, Huang Guangshun, a solo farmer, said: "My family has three laborers, and this year we planted six hectares of land, one horse and one donkey, and wanted to compete with the agricultural production cooperative. When weeding in the summer, I was so busy I was kicking myself. In the autumn, when I calculated, the people in the agricultural production cooperative earned 1.3 *dou* of grain per day, and each laborer divided 18 or 19 *shi* of grain; our three father and sons only harvested 29.9 *shi*, and after deducting public grain and horse feed, each laborer only divided more than 7 *shi* of grain. Wang Dianzhen, a member of the cooperative, had one laborer, no horse, and was sick for more than a month, and still divided 17 *shi* of grain. I am so impressed with the cooperative, it is indeed stronger than working alone!" Huang Guangshun's typical example of comparing himself with the agricultural production cooperative was very educational to the masses in this village.

Fourth, guide farmers to discuss "How to take the socialist road and how to support national industrialization?" Farmers believe that in addition to doing a good job in mutual aid and cooperation and doing a good job in production, we should deliver good public grain and sell the surplus grain to the state. The working cadres also specifically explained to the farmers the benefits of selling surplus grain to the state to the country and to the farmers, and the masses unanimously believed that the surplus grain should be sold to the state, and that "selling early is better than selling late, and selling whole is better than selling in pieces." Li Yongjiu, a farmer in this village, stored some first-class sorghum last year, but this year he sold it as second-class, and the grain at the bottom of the pile was moldy, and even the pigs would not eat it. The masses said: Others turn dead wealth into living wealth, he turns living wealth into dead wealth.

The publicity methods adopted in Lingxia Village mainly include village mass meetings, village patriotism day meetings, forums, and individual chats. The village backbone members gave explanations and raised topics to inspire the masses to discuss. Different education was carried out for wealthy farmers, military families, the elderly, young people, and women. Through the above-mentioned various methods of publicity and education, the publicity of the general line in Lingxia Village has become a household name. There are 561 people in the whole village who have received education once or twice. Due to the continuous publicity and education on the general line in Lingxia Village for six days, the awareness of the farmers has been generally improved. On the evening of November 17th, the farmers of each village, each mutual aid team, and the agricultural production cooperative consciously and voluntarily reported selling all the surplus grain in less than an hour.

The experience of Lingxia Village proves that as long as the publicity and education work is done well, so that the vast number of Party members and farmers understand the general line of the state's transition period, understand the benefits of selling all surplus grain to the state, they can smoothly complete the task of purchasing grain, and can greatly improve the ideological awareness of the vast number of Party members and farmers, and effectively promote the current work.

    关键在于深入向农民进行总路线教育
    ——白城县岭下村收购粮食工作的经验
    中共黑龙江省委农村工作部副部长　骆子程
    黑龙江省白城县第十区岭下村今年粮食丰收。全村耕地五百八十七垧，平均每垧产粮四石九斗九升（每石五百七十斤）。
    从十一月十一日到十七日，我们在岭下村大张旗鼓地宣传了国家过渡时期的总路线。全村农民思想觉悟提高，自动卖给国家余粮一千五百五十石，占总产量的百分之五十二。同时，农民提出了扩大生产的计划：添车三台，买马二十六匹、牛六十七头、羊一百二十二只，价值一亿五千万元左右，占卖粮所得款的百分之三十八。经过这次宣传教育，农民的社会主义觉悟大大提高，扩大生产的积极性高涨，互助合作组织得到进一步巩固和提高，同时推动了当前各项工作。总之，是三头满意：购粮任务完成了，农民觉悟提高了，村领导水平也提高了。
    在进行总路线教育以前，据调查了解，岭下村的农民有卖粮的要求，有扩大生产的要求，但是有些人，对于卖粮还有一些顾虑和错误的想法。如某些富裕农民现在不用钱，想到粮价高时再卖；有些老年人怕卖了粮明年不够吃；有的妇女怕一次卖出大批余粮，零花钱不方便；有的人想把粮食卖给私商等等。
    根据群众的思想情况，我们联系当地的具体事例，深入进行了国家过渡时期总路线的宣传教育。
    第一、通过本村几年来生产提高、互助合作组织发展、农民生活改善等典型事例，联系苏联集体农民生产力高、生活好的事例，进行了新旧道路的对比，说明党在过渡时期将如何领导农民走社会主义道路，并引导农民展望了社会主义社会的美好远景。如村支部书记纪凤志同志运用本村的实际事例向农民宣传说：“土地改革时，咱村有五十六匹马，现在有一百二十四匹；原来有四十只羊，现在有二百六十一只。那时候，都是临时互助组，现在有四个农业生产合作社、三个常年互助组、一个季节性互助组。土地改革以前，本村每年才打一千多石粮，今年全村打粮二千九百多石。这就是在毛主席领导下，大家走新道路的结果。今后咱们要照毛主席指示的总路线去走，将来的光景就能更好。咱村贫农马长秀相信党的话，土地改革后就参加互助组，现在入了农业生产合作社，由缺吃少穿，变成日子一年比一年好；农民张凤臣不相信党的话，不参加互助合作组织，跑到城市里想找轻巧活干，结果卖了房子、地，卖了马，还欠人家的债，他现在也后悔了。”农民听他联系本村活人活事通俗地宣传总路线，都兴奋地说：“讲的碰心！”许多农民说：生活在新中国，你就放心干吧，跟共产党和毛主席走没错！
    第二、通过国家三年来经济恢复和发展的伟大成就和第一个五年建设计划的远景，宣传国家工业化对农民的好处。农民听到五年后我们国家能出产很多汽车、盖起很多工厂，都异常兴奋。我们还帮助农民分析了几年来国家不断降低工业品价格和提高农产品价格带给农民的好处。如伪满时有一年，本村农民石万金的儿子娶媳妇，拉五石高粱到白城子换回一匹家机布（一尺二寸宽的面子，折宽面的布二十五尺），现在五石高粱能买中等青花旗细布四百六十九尺。通过这些事实，提高了农民对工农联盟的认识，使农民认识了国家工业化对农民的好处，鼓舞了农民多打粮食支援国家工业建设的积极性。如一个老农民说：“工业就像水一样，我们农民就像鱼一样。水浅了，鱼就扑腾不开，水深了，鱼才能长大。”
    第三、通过本村互助合作组织多打粮食的实际事例，宣传农业合作化的好处。在宣传中，我们还指出了几年来农民对国家的光荣贡献，指出国家工业化时期农业的重要性和光明的前途，适当批判了少数农民不安心农业生产的思想，坚定了农民搞好互助合作的信心与决心，在全村爱国日群众大会上，单干农民黄广顺说：“我家三个劳动力，今年种六垧地，一马一驴，想跟农业生产合作社赛赛。夏锄时，我脚打后脑勺子忙。到秋后我一算，农业生产合作社内的人干一天挣一斗三升粮，一个劳动力净分十八、九石粮；我们爷儿三个才打二十九石九，除去公粮、马料、每个劳动力才匀七石多粮。社员王殿珍一个劳动力，没有马，病了一个多月，还净分十七石粮。我算佩服合作社，它的确比单干强！”黄广顺和农业生产合作社对比的典型事例，对本村群众教育很大。
    第四、引导农民讨论“怎样走社会主义道路，怎样支援国家工业化？”农民们都认为除了搞好互助合作、搞好生产，目前应该送好公粮，把余粮卖给国家。工作干部还具体向农民讲清了把余粮卖给国家对国家、对农民的好处，群众一致认为应该把余粮卖给国家，并且是“早卖比晚卖强，整卖比零卖强”。本村农民李永久去年存了一些一等的高粱，今年卖了个二等，囤底子的粮食还发了霉，猪都不吃。群众说：别人是死财变活财，他是活财变死财。
    岭下村采用的宣传方式，主要是通过屯的群众会、村的爱国日和座谈会、个别漫谈等形式，由村骨干出面进行讲解，并出题目启发群众讨论。对富裕农民、军属、老年人、青年人和妇女，分别进行了不同的教育。通过上述各种办法进行宣传教育，岭下村关于总路线的宣传作到了家喻户晓。全村受过一次或两次教育的，有五百六十一人。由于六天时间内连续进行了总路线的宣传教育，岭下村农民觉悟普遍提高。十一月十七日晚上，各屯、各个互助组和农业生产合作社的农民，不到一小时就自觉自愿地自报卖出全部余粮。
    岭下村的经验证明：只要宣传教育工作做得好，使广大党员和农民懂得国家过渡时期的总路线，懂得把全部余粮卖给国家的好处，就能顺利完成收购粮食的任务，而且还能大大提高广大党员和农民的思想觉悟，有效地推动当前各项工作。
