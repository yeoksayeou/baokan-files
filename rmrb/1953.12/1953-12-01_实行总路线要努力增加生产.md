    To Implement the General Line, Strive to Increase Production
    Yan Ling
    In order to support national industrial construction, to combat speculative merchants, and to ensure that the people of the whole country have food to eat, many farmers have already sold their surplus grain to the state, and many farmers are still selling. The state and the people of the whole country warmly welcome the farmers to do this, and will record this patriotic behavior of the farmers in the book of merit. Having sold the grain and obtained the money, what should be done? The most important thing is to strive to increase production. The funds obtained from selling grain should be invested in production as much as possible.
    To Build the Country Better, Strive to Increase Production
    Industry and agriculture are like the two wheels of a country; only when the two wheels turn together can the vehicle move forward steadily and quickly. Everyone knows that if the state builds many large factories, industrial products will be more plentiful and cheaper, and farmers will be able to use new agricultural tools and technologies to cultivate the land, and the people of the whole country will be able to live better lives. To build factories, many workers, technicians, and managers are needed; after the factories are built, even more workers, technicians, and managers are needed. The more industry develops, the more workers there will be, the more the urban population will increase, and the more grain, vegetables, oil, and meat will be needed. If farmers do not produce more of these things, factories, mines, construction sites, and cities will face great difficulties. The more industry develops, the more raw materials are needed; if farmers do not produce more of these things, textile factories, flour mills, oil presses, sugar refineries, etc. will not be able to produce more. Furthermore, if more industrial products are produced, but farmers do not have more agricultural products to exchange for them, they cannot use them; if factories increase the production of industrial products but cannot sell them, there is no way to further develop industry.
    The state wants to carry out large-scale construction, not only to build factories, but also to build railways and large-scale water conservancy projects. These projects are also of great benefit to farmers. The more these projects are built, the more grain, vegetables, and other things are needed.
    Therefore, striving to increase the production of grain, cotton, hemp, sesame, sugarcane, vegetables, meat, and other things is the glorious task of farmers all over the country in national construction.
      To Live a Better Life, Strive to Increase Production
    Last year and this year, the total grain production in the country was about 320 billion jin per year. Dividing this amount of grain by the national population, each person has only about 500 jin. To live like the people of the Soviet Union, an average person needs more than 1,000 jin of grain per year. Our country is so large, and the annual increase in population is also a considerable number. To develop production, improve living standards, and increase the number of livestock year after year, livestock also consumes a lot of grain. If the total amount of grain does not increase, how is it possible for everyone to want to live a better life?
    From now on, the more production increases, the better the lives of the farmers themselves will be. In the past, the prices of agricultural products were manipulated by private merchants; when grain, cotton, and other things were harvested, private merchants always lowered the prices. Farmers increased production, but it was not necessarily beneficial to themselves. Now that the state purchases, the reasonable price of grain is guaranteed, ensuring that farmers will never suffer losses. This is the case with grain, and it is also the case with cotton and other things. In the past, it was not very convenient for cotton farmers to buy grain; they had to go to other places to buy it, and the prices were often subject to the whims of private merchants. Now, the state has sufficient grain in its hands, and the grain needed by farmers in cotton-producing areas is also guaranteed, so they can also concentrate on increasing cotton production. Some farmers who used to grow cotton are now unwilling to grow cotton anymore, which is not good. The state needs more cotton, and farmers who increase cotton production and sell it to the state, the state also guarantees that they will not suffer losses. The same is true for farmers who grow vegetables, sesame, peanuts, sugarcane, sugar beets, and other crops. As long as the government calls on them to grow something, they will not suffer losses. The more production, the more income. Therefore, after farmers sell grain, cotton, and other agricultural products, they can rest assured and expand production. Whether it is a production cooperative, a mutual aid team, or a individual farmer, every household must increase production. As long as production increases, it will be beneficial to both the state and themselves.
    Everyone Can Increase Production
    Is there potential for the development of agricultural production? Not only is there, but it is also great. Currently, the total area of land in the country planted with grain crops is about 1.83 billion mu. If the average yield per mu is increased by more than 50 jin, it can increase production by about 100 billion jin of grain per year compared to the present. Currently, the average yield of wheat per mu in our country is only about 100 jin, but the highest is more than 1,300 jin; the average yield of rice per mu is only about 300 jin, but the highest is more than 1,700 jin. Increasing the average yield per mu by more than 50 jin, although not easy to do, is by no means impossible. If it is done, it will be of great use. One hundred billion jin of grain, based on each person eating 650 jin of grain per year, is enough for 150 million people to eat for more than a year.
    The area of land planted with cotton in the country is about 80 million mu. The average yield of cotton is about 100 jin per mu; the highest yield has reached more than 1,200 jin per mu. It can be seen that the yield of cotton can also be greatly increased. If the average yield per mu is increased by 50 jin, it can harvest 4 billion jin of seed cotton more each year, equivalent to about 1.3 billion jin of ginned cotton, which can be spun into yarn to weave more than 200 million bolts of cloth, enough for everyone in the country to make two or three new sets of clothes.
    Some farmers say: Seeing is believing, hearing is deceiving. Well, everyone can see for themselves that in every village, there are cases where the same land has produced more grain and less grain. Why do some produce more and some produce less? If everyone compares their farming skills, they will surely find the reasons. Some farmers accidentally produce more grain one year, and they don't even know why, so they call it "hitting a treasure field," and they don't even dare to talk about it, saying that if they talk about it, it will no longer be effective. In fact, it is just that their farming this year happened to be in line with scientific principles. Think more, compare more, and the reasons for producing more grain can be found.
    In every village, there are farmers with high, medium, and low yields. Not to mention that the highest can be further improved, and not to mention that everyone can catch up with the highest, just if the lower yields catch up with the medium yields, how much more will a village produce? How much more will a county, a province, and even the whole country produce? Everyone can calculate it for themselves! Some farmers say: Production has been increasing every year since liberation, and the increase has reached its peak. In fact, it is still a long way from the "peak"!
    To Increase Production, Be Prepared
    How to increase production? To increase production, it is best to participate in mutual aid and cooperation. However, even farmers who have not yet participated in mutual aid and cooperation can still increase production. Generally speaking, whether it is a mutual aid team, a cooperative, or an individual farmer, to increase production, they probably have to do the following things:
    First, build small-scale farmland water conservancy projects. This year, the farmers of Wufu Township in Mianzhu County, Sichuan Province, built water conservancy projects, which not only turned the original more than 5,000 mu of water-deficient fields into water-saturated fields, but also turned more than 200 mu of dry land into paddy fields. As a result, the more than 28,000 mu of rice in the township generally had a bumper harvest this year, which can increase the production of more than 700,000 jin of rice. The farmers on both sides of the Suichuan Canal in Jiangxi Province have repaired ditches that can irrigate tens of thousands of mu of land, and their agricultural income has increased year by year, and they are singing such mountain songs everywhere: "The canal water flows eastward, and the farmers on both sides are happy with the bumper harvest. The people's government leads well, and there is a guarantee of bumper harvests every year." The wheat fields on both sides of the canals in various parts of Shaanxi Province were watered this spring, and generally increased production by 10% to 30%. The construction of ponds and wells in various places has also played a significant role in increasing production. Investing in the construction of small-scale water conservancy is a very important way to increase production.
    Second, buy fertilizer and find ways to accumulate more fertilizer. "People don't deceive the land, and the land doesn't deceive people," this is what farmers know. So to increase production, you have to buy fertilizer powder and soybean cake, and more importantly, accumulate more fertilizer. You can try to use weeds, fallen leaves, and straw to compost manure. Where there are no toilets, build toilets. Raising livestock and pigs to accumulate fertilizer is also a good way. Where there are no livestock pens or pigsties, build pens. Zhang Guozhong, a farmer in Cangqian Village, Fumin County, Yunnan Province, said: "Selling grain to the state early, getting money to build a pen as soon as possible, accumulating 300 loads of pen manure, and next year you can increase the production of rice by 500 jin." The members of the He Huaiqin mutual aid team in Xia County, Shanxi Province, plan to sell six or seven dan of wheat, add a cow and four piglets, and accumulate a total of 20 to 30 carts of pen fertilizer in one winter, enough for topdressing eight mu of wheat land, and they can increase the production of wheat by nearly two dan next year. Their plans are all very correct.
    Third, carry out winter plowing and soil moisture conservation. The south can carry out winter plowing all the time, which can not only improve the soil, but also turn out insects and freeze them to death. The north can also carry out winter plowing before the ground is frozen solid, which in addition to improving the soil, is also beneficial for retaining rainwater and snow moisture and eliminating insects. Guo Shudong's cotton field in Guowangdu Village, Anyang, Henan Province, was winter plowed the year before last, and yielded 200 jin per mu last year. Guo Shuyu's land of the same soil quality, without winter plowing, had more manure than Guo Shudong's land, but yielded only 170 jin per mu. If there is little rain and snow in winter in some places, the land should also be harrowed to conserve soil moisture after winter plowing. In places with more rain and snow in winter, it is better not to harrow.
    Fourth, add draft animals and protect draft animals to safely overwinter. Where a family cannot afford to buy one and has experience in jointly raising livestock, they can buy livestock together. Prepare sufficient fodder for the livestock, prevent livestock from getting sick, and oppose the arbitrary slaughter of cattle.
    Fifth, add and repair farm tools. If you can buy new farm tools, buy new farm tools. In places where there are no new farm tools, or farmers who are not willing to use new farm tools for a while, adding some old farm tools is also beneficial to increasing production.
    In addition, sideline production that is helpful to agricultural production can also be developed, but the sales channels must be inquired about first. Some sideline industries that waste grain, such as making maltose and wine, should not be engaged in. It is also wrong for some farmers to regard doing business as a "sideline industry," as it is mostly earning money by exploitation, which is of no benefit to production and will delay production instead.
    After selling grain and cotton, with money, should you improve your life? Of course you should. However, if the improvement is too fast, faster than the increase in production, it is not good. In this way, more capital cannot be put into agricultural production, and production cannot be improved. If production cannot be improved, life cannot be improved more. What to do with the money that you can't use up? It should be deposited in the bank or the credit department of the cooperative, and you can also get reasonable interest. This is a patriotic and mutual aid behavior, and does not count as exploitation.
    To Increase Production, Improve Technology
    When the Communist Party and the People's Government send cadres to lead farmers to increase production, some farmers say: We have been farming for decades, don't we know how to farm? You need to lead us to fight the landlords, but we don't need you to manage production. "Farming work, no need to learn." "Big manure and diligent watering, no need to ask anyone." This statement is wrong. The experience of old farmers has been accumulated over thousands of years, and of course there are many good things in it that should be passed down. However, just having the experience of old farmers is not enough now. If you want to increase production more, you have to learn new technologies. When there is not much manure and too little water, it is right to talk about "big manure and diligent watering." However, some farmers have accumulated more manure and have money to buy fertilizer in recent years, and they have also built water conservancy, so they desperately apply more manure and water more; in the end, they caused the wheat and rice to lodge, and the cotton to grow crazy. There is a Jinghui Canal in Shaanxi, where the farmers grow the most cotton; however, some farmers, because they do not understand scientific technology, have turned many good lands into bad lands. Many farmers only know to accumulate more fertilizer, but they do not know the scientific principles, and put urine and plant ash together, which changes and greatly reduces the effectiveness of the fertilizer. This spring, some places used ropes and sticks to pull dew to prevent frost, but killed many wheat plants instead. Everyone see, is it okay not to understand scientific technology?
      As long as you pay attention to improving technology, you will definitely be able to increase production. According to scientific research: without increasing any investment, just by improving the sowing method and implementing appropriate close planting, China can increase the production of several million tons (one ton is equal to 2,000 jin) of wheat a year. The same is true for planting other crops. As long as the technology is correctly improved, there is no way to not increase production. Therefore, in order to strive for a large increase in production next year, farmers must work hard to learn new technologies, promote new technologies, and oppose conservative views.
    Some cadres lead farmers to promote technology, but instead cause farmers to reduce production. This is because these cadres do not understand scientific technology, do not study hard, and the methods and styles of promoting technology are not correct. We should ask these cadres to improve their work methods and styles, but we cannot blame scientific technology for being bad.
    New-style walking plows, new-style waterwheels, chemical fertilizers, etc., are all good things. It's just that some cadres didn't teach everyone the technology of using them when they promoted them, so some walking plows became "hanging plows," some waterwheels became "sleeping waterwheels," and some fertilizers became "waste materials." As long as you learn how to use them, you will know their benefits. Like the Chenjiazhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Datong County, Shanxi Province, which recently sold more than 200,000 jin of surplus grain to the state, the land is completely cultivated with new-style walking plows. Their millet roots are one chi long, with more than 60 root hairs. The same land, cultivated with old-style plows, has millet roots only three cun long, with only more than 20 root hairs. Everyone see, how can using new-style plows not increase production?
    The Task of Agriculture is Glorious, and the Future of the Countryside is Bright
    Some farmers say: "These days, it's like eating sugarcane with mud, eat one section and wipe one section, eat if you can, otherwise, maybe you won't be able to eat it yourself. In the future, when everyone reaches socialism, can they leave me alone?" Some people say: "The Communist Party loves the poor, and being poor is a good thing, what's the point of producing so much?" There are also some people who think that farming is not as profitable and quick as doing business, and want to climb the road of capitalists. These people are all wrong. If everyone thinks this way, we will have no bright future. If only a few people think this way, they will not only be laughed at by everyone, but it will also be detrimental to themselves in the short term. Those who increase production have a good life, and those who do not increase production will never get any benefits. The Communist Party does not love all the poor, but loves the upright and hard-working poor; now that everyone has land, if they become poor because they do not work hard, it is not glorious at all. Even when it comes to socialism, those who work the best will still live the best and be the most respected. As for those who don't want to farm and want to do business, it is even less the right path for farmers. Exploiting others to get rich, how can that be as glorious as being an upright and honest working people! Their rich lives, how can they be as reliable as the rich lives of members of production cooperatives!
    Some rural cadres are not at ease working in the countryside, and always feel that working in the countryside is not promising. This is also wrong. Agriculture is developing step by step, slowly becoming like the agriculture of the Soviet Union, and it needs many capable people to lead it. Industry will never be separated from agriculture in the future. Even in the present, agriculture occupies a very important position in the entire national construction work. Some cadres lead workers to build in cities, and some cadres lead farmers to build in rural areas. Cities and villages compete with each other and support each other, and one day they will build all the villages as well as the cities.
    Increasing agricultural production is a glorious and great cause, and there is no way that strength and talent cannot be used in agriculture. Farmers and comrades who work in rural areas, in order to implement the general line of national industrialization and socialist transformation, in order to build the whole of China into a socialist paradise, in order for everyone to live a better life, let us strive to develop mutual aid and cooperation and strive to increase production!

    实行总路线要努力增加生产
    燕凌
    为了支援国家工业建设，为了打击投机奸商，让全国人民有饭吃，许多农民已经把余粮卖给国家了，许多农民还正在卖。国家和全国人民都热烈欢迎农民们这样做，都要把农民的这种爱国行为记在功劳簿子上。卖了粮食，得了钱，应该怎么办呢？顶要紧的就是努力增加生产。卖粮得到的款子，要多多地投到生产上去。
    为了把国家建设得更好要努力增产
    工业和农业好比国家的两个车轮子；两个轮子一齐转，车子才能平平稳稳快快当当地往前走。大家都知道，国家办起很多大工厂，工业品才能更多更便宜，农民才能使用新农具新技术种地，全国人民才能把日子过得更好。要修建工厂，得要很多工人、技术人员和管理人员；工厂修好了，还得要很多工人、技术人员和管理人员。工业越发展，工人就越多，城市人口就越多，需要粮食、蔬菜、油类、肉类也越多。农民不多多生产这些东西，工厂、矿山、工地和城市就要发生很大的困难。工业越发展，需要的原料也越多；农民不多多生产这些东西，纺织厂、面粉厂、榨油厂、制糖厂等等也就不能多多地生产。再说，更多的工业品生产出来了，农民没有更多的农产品来换，也用不上；工厂增产了工业品卖不出去，也没办法更大地发展工业。
    国家要进行大建设，不光是要修工厂，还要修铁路，修大的水利工程。这些工程对农民也是有很大好处的。越要多修这些工程，就也越需要更多的粮食、蔬菜等等东西。
    所以，努力增产粮食，棉花、麻、芝麻、甘蔗、蔬菜、肉类等等东西，是全国农民在国家建设里边的光荣任务。
      为了自己日子过得更好要努力增产
    去年和今年全国每年大约总共打了三千二百多亿斤粮食。把这么多粮食按全国人口分开，每一口人只有五百多斤。要过像苏联人民那样的生活，平均一口人一年要有一千多斤粮食才行。我们国家这么大，年年添人添口也是个不小的数目。发展生产，改善生活，牲畜也不能不年年添加。牲畜也要消耗不少粮食。要是粮食总数不增加，大家都想过更好的日子，怎么可能呢？
    从今往后，增产越多，农民自己的日子就能越好。过去，农产品的价钱受私商摆弄；粮食、棉花等等东西收下来的时候，私商总是要压价。农民增产了也不一定就对自己有好处。现在有国家收购，粮食的合理价格有了保证，保准农民永不会吃亏。粮食是这样，棉花等等东西也是这样。过去，种棉花的农民要买粮食总是不大方便，要到外地去买，价钱上也往往受私商的气。现在，国家掌握足够的粮食，产棉地方的农民要吃的粮食也有了保证，也可以安心地增产棉花了。有些过去种棉花的农民现在不愿意种棉花了，这是不好的。国家是需要更多棉花的，农民增产棉花卖给国家，国家也保证不会叫他们吃亏。对于种蔬菜、芝麻、花生、甘蔗、糖萝卜等等作物的农民来说，也都是一样的。只要政府号召种什么自己就种什么，就准吃不了亏。生产越多，收入就越多。因此，农民们卖了粮食棉花和别的农产品以后，尽管放心放手扩大生产好了。不论是生产合作社、是互助组或是单干农民，家家户户都要增加生产。只要增加生产，对国家对自己就都有好处。
    大家都能够增加生产
    农业生产有没有发展的可能呢？不但有，而且很大。现在全国种粮食作物的地大约十八亿三千多万亩，平均每亩地上多打五十多斤粮食，就可以比现在每年增产大约一千亿斤粮食。现在咱们全国小麦的平均每亩产量只有一百来斤，最高的却有一千三百多斤；水稻平均每亩产量只有三百来斤，最高的却有一千七百斤。平均每亩多打五十斤粮食，做起来虽然不是怎么容易，可是也决不是做不到的事。做到了，用处可就大了。一千亿斤粮食，按每个人每年吃六百五十斤粮食来说，就够一万万五千万人吃一年多。
    现在全国种棉花的地在八千万亩左右。现在棉花的平均产量大约每亩一百斤；产量最高的却达到了每亩一千二百多斤。可见棉花的产量也是还能大大提高的。如果平均每亩提高五十斤，每年就能多收四十亿斤籽棉，约合十三亿斤皮棉，纺成纱能织成二亿多匹布，够全国每个人做两三身新衣服。
    有些农民说：眼见为实，耳听为虚。那么，大家自己亲自看一看吧，同样的土地有的多打了粮食，有的少打了粮食的事在各个乡村里都能找到。为什么有的多打，有的少打？大家把种地的手艺比较比较，准能找出道理来。有的农民偶然有一年多打了粮食，自己也不知道是什么道理，就把这叫做“打了宝场”，连讲也不敢讲，说是一讲出去就不再灵验了。其实，这不过是他这一年种地的时候碰巧合乎科学的道理了。多想想，多比比，是能把多打粮食的原故找出来的。
    每个村子里的农民的产量都有高的，有中等的，有低的。先不说最高的还能再提高，也先不讲大家都赶上最高的，只要产量比较低的都向中等的看齐，一个村子就能增产多少？一个县，一个省以至全国能增产多少？大家自己算一算看！有些农民说：解放以来年年增产，增产已经到顶了。其实，离“顶”还不知道有多远哩！
    要增加生产就要做好准备
    怎样增加生产呢？要增产，当然最好是参加互助合作。不过，就是还没有参加互助合作的农民，也还是能够增产。一般地说来，无论互助组、合作社和单干农民，要增产，大概都得做以下几件事：
    第一、要兴修小型农田水利。四川省绵竹县五福乡农民今年兴修了水利，不但把原有五千多亩缺水田变成饱水田，还把两百多亩旱地变成了水田；因此，全乡二万八千多亩水稻今年普遍丰收，可增产七十多万斤稻谷。江西遂川渠两岸农民修好了能灌几万亩田的沟渠，农业收入一年比一年增加，到处唱着这样的山歌：“陂水沟渠向东流，两岸农民喜丰收，人民政府领导好，年年丰收有把握。”陕西省各条渠道两岸的小麦地，今年春天浇了水，一般增产一成到三成。各地修水塘、打井，对于增产也都起了不小的作用。投资兴修小型水利，是增产的很重要的一个办法。
    第二、要购买肥料并且想办法多积肥料。“人不哄地，地不哄人”，这是农民们都知道的。所以要增产，就得买肥田粉和豆饼，更要紧的是多积肥。可以尽量用杂草、落叶、秸杆沤粪。没有厕所的地方要修厕所。养牲口、养猪积肥也是个好办法。没有牲口圈、猪圈的地方要修圈。云南富民县仓前村农民张国忠说：“把粮食早卖给国家，得了钱及早盖个圈，积到三百挑圈粪，明年就能增产稻谷五百斤。”山西夏县何会亲互助组的组员们计划卖六七石麦，添买牛一头、小猪四口，总共一冬能积二三十车圈肥，够八亩麦地追肥用，明年能增产小麦近两石。他们这样打算都很对。
    第三、要进行冬耕和保墒。南方一直可以进行冬耕，这不但可以把土变好，还能把虫翻出来冻死。北方在地没有冻实以前也可以冬耕，这除了把土变好以外，对于留住雨雪的水分和除虫也都有好处。河南安阳郭王度村郭授东的棉花地前年冬耕了，去年一亩收了二百斤；郭授玉的同样土质的地，没有冬耕，比郭授东的地上粪还多，一亩地只收了一百七十斤。有的地方如果冬天雨雪少，冬耕后还要耙地保墒。冬季雨雪多的地方，还是不要耙好。
    第四、要添买耕畜并且保护耕畜安全过冬。一家买不起而且有伙养牲口的经验的地方，可以伙买牲口。要给牲口准备好足够的草料，要防备牲口生病，要反对随意宰杀耕牛。
    第五、要添置和修补农具。能买新式农具就买新式农具。没有新式农具的地方，或者一时还不愿意用新式农具的农民，添些老式农具对增产也是有好处的。
    此外，对农业生产有帮助的副业生产也可以发展，不过要把销路先打听好。有些浪费粮食的副业，像做糖稀、做酒等等，就不要搞。有些农民把做生意当成“副业”，也是不对的，那多半是靠剥削赚钱，对生产没有什么好处，反而会耽误生产。
    卖了粮食、棉花以后，有了钱，应该不应该改善生活呢？当然应该。可是，要是改善得太快，比生产的增加还要快，那就不好了。这样，就不能把更多的本钱放到农业生产上，生产就不能提高了。生产不能提高，生活就不能更多改善了。自己用不完的钱怎么办呢？应该存到银行里或者合作社的信用部里，自己还可以得到合理的利钱。这是爱国的、互助的行为，不算是剥削。
    要增加生产就要改进技术
    共产党和人民政府派干部领导农民增加生产，有些农民说：我们种了几十年地还不会种地？斗地主得有你们来领导，生产可就用不着你们管了。“庄稼活，不用学。”“粪大水勤，不用人问。”这说法是不对的。老农的经验是几千年积下来的，里面当然有很多好东西，应该流传。可是，光是有老农的经验，现在就不够了。要是想多增产，不学新技术就不行。在粪还不多、水还太少的时候，讲“粪大水勤”是对的。可是，有些农民这几年积的粪多了，也有钱买肥料了，也修了水利，就拚命多上粪、多浇水；到后来，反把麦子、稻子倒伏了，棉花长疯了。陕西有一条泾惠渠，那里的农民种棉花的顶多；可是，有些农民因为不懂科学技术，把许多好地也变成坏地了。许多农民光知道多积肥，可是不知道科学道理，把尿和草木灰放到一起，起了变化，肥料的效力大大减少了。今年春天有些地方为了防霜，用绳子棍子拉露水，反而把许多麦子拉死了。大家看，不懂科学技术行吗？
      只要注意改进技术，就一定能够增产。据科学家调查研究：不增加一点投资，光是改进播种方法，实行适当密植，全中国一年就能增产几百万吨（一吨合两千斤）小麦。种别的庄稼也是一样。只要正确地改进技术，没有不能增产的。所以农民们为了争取明年大大增产，一定要努力学习新技术，推广新技术，反对保守观点。
    有些干部领导农民推广技术，反而使农民落了个减产。这是因为这些干部不懂科学技术，又不好好学习，而且推广技术的方法不对，作风不好。我们应该要求这些干部改进工作方法和作风，可是不能怪科学技术不好。
    新式步犁、新式水车、化学肥料等等，全都是好东西。只不过因为有些干部在推广时没把使用技术教给大家，一些步犁才变成了“挂犁”，一些水车才变成了“睡车”，一些肥料才变成了“废料”。只要学会使用，就知道它们的好处了。像最近卖给国家二十多万斤余粮的山西大同县陈家庄农业生产合作社，土地完全是用新式步犁耕种的。他们的谷子根长一尺，根须六十多股。同样的地，用旧式犁耕的，谷子根只有三寸长，根须只有二十多股。大家看，用新式犁怎么能不增产？
    农业的任务是光荣的，农村的前途是远大的
    有的农民说：“这年头，就像吃沾着泥巴的甘蔗，吃一节揩一节就行，得吃就吃，要不，也许自己就吃不上了。将来大家都到了社会主义，还能把我一个人撇下？”有的人说：“共产党爱穷人，穷了沾光，生产那么多有什么好？”还有些人认为种地不如做生意得利快、赚钱多，想向资本家的路上爬。这些人都想错了。如果大伙儿都是这样想，咱们就没有光明的前途了。只是少数人这样想，他们不但会受到大家耻笑，就是眼前对自己也不利。增产的人都有好日子过，不增产的人决沾不了光。共产党并不是爱所有的穷人，是爱正派爱劳动的穷人；现在大家都有了土地，如果因为自己不好好劳动穷困了，那一点也不光彩。就是到了社会主义，也还是劳动最好的人生活得最好，最受尊敬。至于不想种地、想做生意，更不是农民的正路。剥削别人来发财，那有做一个堂堂正正的劳动人民光荣！他们的富裕生活，那有生产合作社社员们的富裕生活靠得住！
    有些农村干部不安心在农村工作，总觉着在农村工作没有多大出息。这也想错了。农业一步一步向前发展，慢慢变成苏联的农业那个样子，要很多有本领的人领导。工业将来永远也离不了农业。就是在眼前，农业在整个国家建设工作里边也占着很重要的地位。有些干部领导工人在城市里建设，有些干部领导农民在农村里建设。城市和农村一面互相比赛，一面互相支援，总有一天会把农村都建设得和城市差不多。
    增加农业生产是光荣伟大的事业，有力量有才干在农业上决不是使不上劲的。农民们和在农村工作的同志们，为了实行国家工业化和社会主义改造的总路线，为了把整个中国建设成一个社会主义的乐园，为了大家都把日子过得更好，努力发展互助合作、努力增加生产吧！
