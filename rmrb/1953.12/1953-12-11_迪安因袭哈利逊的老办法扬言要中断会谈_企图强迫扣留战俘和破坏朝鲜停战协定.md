　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 9th. (By our special correspondent Jiang Nan) After the US side dragged the bilateral talks on the political conference issue past the 8th UN General Assembly, it is now deliberately creating a deadlock in an attempt to completely destroy the current talks, so that Syngman Rhee can freely and forcibly detain prisoners of war and undermine the Korean armistice. The Korean and Chinese side sharply exposed this conspiracy by the US side at today's meeting.

　　On the same day that the 8th UN General Assembly passed a resolution to postpone the discussion of the Korean issue and adjourned, the US side put forward a so-called "draft proposal" in Panmunjom. The US side obviously believes that since the first goal of delaying the talks has been achieved, it can boldly realize its second goal - dragging it past January 21 next year, in order to forcibly detain prisoners of war. The so-called "draft proposal" put forward by Dean on the 8th is a once-and-for-all tool used by the US side to continue to delay or even sabotage the talks. Dean publicly declared outside the meeting on the 8th, in a tone that Harriman had repeatedly used in the armistice negotiations, "This is our final proposal." "Our next step is to get them to accept it." He told a reporter from the Associated Press, "My work is done, and from now on I only need to sit and wait."

　　On the same day, the Associated Press reported from Tokyo that "a senior person in Korea" from the United States "predicted" that "the American delegation will leave here before December 20." This proves that when Dean put forward his so-called "draft proposal," he knew that the Korean and Chinese side would never accept it, so he had already planned to sabotage the talks. As the Korean and Chinese side revealed at the meetings on the 8th and 9th, this so-called "comprehensive proposal" by the US side contains nothing new except the old anti-Soviet propaganda and the absurd methods of restricting the role of neutral countries, as well as the unreasonable proposal to indefinitely postpone the date of the political conference. Dean's proposal of this "draft proposal" composed of unreasonable demands that had already been rejected by the Korean and Chinese side is nothing more than a deliberate attempt to prevent the problem from being resolved, so as to put the talks in a deadlock, while deceiving world public opinion and shirking its responsibility.

　　Dean's attempt to sabotage the talks has been openly expressed today. He claimed that he "has the power to interrupt the preliminary meeting at any time." At the same time, the American propaganda machine is under orders to change its hypocritical optimistic tone of the past few days and spread pessimistic air, saying that the hope of holding a political conference will "vanish." The situation in Panmunjom now is very similar to the situation in Panmunjom in October 1952. At that time, Harriman's several "final, firm, and unchangeable" unreasonable plans were thoroughly refuted, and he could no longer sit in his unenviable position. Finally, in order to use the 7th UN General Assembly to sabotage the negotiations, Harriman put forward the so-called "three proposals" which were the same old wine in new bottles, knowing that the Korean and Chinese side would not accept them. Then, he unilaterally interrupted the armistice negotiations, putting the negotiations in a dangerous deadlock. Now, Dean is obviously in a similar embarrassing position to Harriman at that time. All his self-contradictory and unreasonable demands have been thoroughly exposed and refuted, and his propaganda tricks have been exhausted. He is now clearly trying to learn from Harriman's methods, putting forward a so-called "draft proposal" that he knows the Korean and Chinese side will not accept, and then unilaterally interrupting the talks, in order to avoid continuing to be in the position of the accused in front of world public opinion, and to give Syngman Rhee the opportunity to realize his conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war and undermine the armistice.

　　In order to force the United States' allies to agree to the United States' sabotage conspiracy, Syngman Rhee is under orders to yell and shout, opposing neutral countries' participation in the political conference, and claiming that he must "release" the prisoners of war on January 22 next year. The United States is trying to use the shouting of Syngman Rhee's sheepdog to drive those allies like sheep into the trap pre-designed by the United States, forcing them to allow the United States to sabotage the bilateral talks, forcibly detain prisoners of war, in order to achieve the goal of undermining the armistice agreement and maintaining tension in the Far East.

　　The Korean and Chinese side has sternly told Dean today that his threat to interrupt the talks cannot scare anyone. No matter how the US side obstructs and sabotages, the efforts made by the Korean and Chinese side to peacefully resolve the Korean issue will never cease. In the more than two years of the Korean armistice negotiations, the Korean and Chinese side has defeated the US side's sabotage conspiracy more than once. If Dean really wants to learn something from Harriman and his like, it is best to learn some lessons in this regard.

    迪安因袭哈利逊的老办法扬言要中断会谈
    企图强迫扣留战俘和破坏朝鲜停战协定
    【新华社开城九日电】本社特派记者江南报道：美方在将关于政治会议问题的双方会谈拖过第八届联合国大会这一关以后，现在正在蓄意制造僵局，企图完全破坏目前的会谈，以便使李承晚得以放手强迫扣留战俘、破坏朝鲜停战。朝中方面在今天的会议上尖锐地揭露了美方的这一阴谋。
    就在第八届联合国大会通过延期讨论朝鲜问题、宣告休会的同一天，美方在板门店提出了所谓“建议草案”。美方显然认为，他们拖延会谈的第一个目的既然已经达到，就可以大胆地实现它的第二个目的——拖过明年一月二十一日，以便强迫扣留战俘。迪安在八日提出的这个所谓“建议草案”，就是美方用来继续拖延以至破坏会谈的一劳永逸的工具。迪安八日在会外用哈利逊在停战谈判中曾经一再用过的腔调公开宣称，“这是我们最后的建议。”“我们的下一步就是要他们接受它。”他对合众社的记者说，“我的工作已经完了，今后我只消坐待。”
    就在同一天，美联社从东京报道美国的“一位在朝鲜的高级人士”的“预言”说：“美国代表团将于十二月二十日以前离开这里。”这就证明迪安在提出他的所谓“建议草案”的时候，就明知朝中方面是决不会接受的，因此早就作了破坏会谈的打算。正如朝中方面在八、九两日会议上所揭露的，美方这个所谓“全面建议”除了老一套的反苏宣传和限制中立国作用的荒谬办法，以及无限期拖延政治会议召开日期的无理主张以外，什么新的东西也没有。迪安提出这个用早已为朝中方面拒绝过的无理要求构成的“建议草案”，无非是故意要使问题得不到解决，以便陷会谈于僵局，同时用以欺骗世界舆论、推卸自己的责任。
    迪安这种破坏会谈的企图今天已经公然表示了出来。他宣称他“有权力随时中断预备会议”。同时，美国宣传机器正在奉命一改前几天的虚伪乐观论调，大肆散放悲观空气，说什么举行政治会议的希望将“化为泡影”。现在板门店的情势和一九五二年十月间的板门店情势十分相似。那时候，哈利逊的几个“最后的、坚定的、不可改变的”无理方案都遭到了彻底的驳斥，他在他那无可羡慕的位置上再也坐不住了。最后为了利用第七届联合国大会来破坏谈判，哈利逊提出了明知朝中方面不会接受的换汤不换药的所谓“三项建议”，接着就片面中断了停战谈判，陷谈判于危险的僵局。现在，迪安显然也处于和哈利逊当时相似的尴尬地位。他的所有自相矛盾的无理主张都遭到了彻底的揭露和驳斥，他的宣传伎俩已经用光了。他现在显然企图学哈利逊的办法，提出明知朝中方面不会接受的所谓“建议草案”，然后，片面中断会谈，以免继续在世界舆论面前处于被告的地位，并使李承晚得有机会来实现他强迫扣留战俘、破坏停战的阴谋。
    为了迫使美国的盟国同意美国的这个破坏阴谋，李承晚正在奉命大叫大嚷，反对中立国参加政治会议，声称一定要在明年一月二十二日“释放”战俘。美国企图用李承晚这只牧羊犬的叫嚣，把那些盟国像绵羊一样地赶到美国所预先设计好的圈套里去，强迫他们听任美国破坏双方会谈，强迫扣留战俘，以达到破坏停战协定，在远东保持紧张局势的目的。
    朝中方面今天已经严正地告诉迪安，他的中断会谈的威胁是吓不倒任何人的。无论美方如何阻挠破坏，朝中方面为和平解决朝鲜问题所作的努力是决不中止的。在两年多的朝鲜停战谈判中，朝中方面曾经不止一次击败了美国方面的破坏阴谋。迪安如果真正要向哈利逊之流学点什么的话，最好还是学点这方面的教训。
