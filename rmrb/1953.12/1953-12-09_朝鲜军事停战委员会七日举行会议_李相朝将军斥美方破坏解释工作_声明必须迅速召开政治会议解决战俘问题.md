Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 7th: The Korean Military Armistice Commission’s Korean-Chinese delegation issued the following communique: The “Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission” clearly stipulates that the explanatory work conducted by both sides of the Korean Armistice toward all non-directly repatriated prisoners of war dependent on their respective sides should commence immediately after the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission takes custody of all prisoners of war, and should have a period of ninety days. The handling of prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to repatriation after the explanation should be resolved by the political conference within thirty days.

However, the US side initially delayed the construction of explanation facilities, postponing the commencement of the Korean-Chinese side's explanation work by as much as nineteen days. Subsequently, it directed its special agents to prevent prisoners of war from listening to the explanation and threatened the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission not to take effective measures to punish the special agents, thereby causing the Korean-Chinese side's explanation work to be repeatedly interrupted for long periods of time since its commencement, to the point where it is currently impossible to proceed at all. On the other hand, the US side is now deliberately dragging its feet in the talks between the two sides at Panmunjom regarding the political conference issue, attempting to postpone the convening of the political conference for a long time. At the same time, the US side is openly clamoring for the absurd argument that its so-called "explanation period should end on December 22nd" and "prisoners of war should be released as civilians on January 21st." This fully demonstrates that the US side is systematically undermining the explanation work, delaying the political conference, and attempting to forcibly detain Korean-Chinese captured personnel.

At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on December 7th, General Li Sang-cho, chief commissioner of the Korean-Chinese side, solemnly stated: Since the Korean-Chinese side's explanation work has failed to commence on schedule and proceed normally without interruption in accordance with the provisions of the "Terms of Reference" due to the direct obstruction by the US side and the sabotage by special agents arranged and directed by the US side, and has fallen into a state where it is impossible to proceed at all, a political conference should be convened quickly to discuss and resolve the prisoner of war issue. However, no matter when the political conference is convened, the handling of prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to repatriation must be discussed and resolved in the political conference, and the US side is absolutely not allowed to handle it unilaterally. The US side's conspiracy to delay the political conference and forcibly detain prisoners of war will absolutely not be allowed to succeed.

The full text of General Li Sang-cho's main speech is as follows:

“Your side directly instructed the Li-Chiang special agents to carry out various sabotage activities, causing our side's explanation work to be repeatedly interrupted for long periods of time, to the point where it is impossible to proceed at all. Your side threatened the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission not to take effective measures to punish the special agents, so that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission could not implement the decisions of the 'Terms of Reference.' Your side even attempted to distort the 'Terms of Reference,' to stop the explanation work on December 22nd, and to unilaterally release the prisoners of war as civilians on January 21, 1954, which is essentially forcibly detaining all prisoners of war. I must first point out that our side will never agree to your conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war.

Your side disregarded the provisions of the 'Terms of Reference' and our side's repeated serious warnings, and arranged for a large number of special agents to infiltrate the Tongjang-ri prisoner of war camp disguised as prisoners of war. Fearing that these special agents would be recognized by our side, your side has not yet submitted to our side the list of prisoners of war that your side claims to have transferred to the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. After these special agents infiltrated the prisoner of war camp, your side used various illegal means to maintain contact and directly command them. Your side smuggled radio transmitters into the prisoner of war camp to communicate with the special agents in code. Your side dispatched special agents to travel between Seoul and the Tongjang-ri prisoner of war camp. Your side and your military control areas sent various flag signals to the special agents in the Tongjang-ri prisoner of war camp. Your side used the US 64th Field Hospital as a headquarters for the special agents inside and outside the prisoner of war camp to conduct liaison. Through these illegal means, your side continued to direct the special agents to maintain a reign of terror in the prisoner of war camp, using inhumane violence to undermine the explanation work and obstruct the repatriation of prisoners of war. The letters of instruction intercepted by the Indian Custodial Force, which your side sent to the special agents in the prisoner of war camp, cannot be denied by your side and fully prove your illegal activities of thoroughly destroying the 'Terms of Reference.'

As early as before the prisoners of war were transferred to the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, your side had already actively arranged various steps to undermine the explanation work. After the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission took custody of the prisoners of war, your side delayed the construction of appropriate explanation facilities and put forward absurd time requirements for the construction, deliberately delaying the start of the explanation work. Only under our side's thorough exposure and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's firm opposition did your side finally have to carry out the construction of the explanation camp according to the requirements of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, but it had already delayed the start of the explanation work by nineteen days. Since our side's explanation work began on October 15th, your side has directly instructed the special agents to undermine the explanation work, even preventing the prisoners of war from listening to the explanation at all, causing our side's explanation work to be repeatedly interrupted for long periods of time. Up to now, our side's explanation work has only been carried out seven times, with a total of less than forty-three hours of actual explanation time. Even within these forty-three hours, your side's special agents held the prisoners of war and made a lot of noise, reciting incantations. The Li-Chiang special agents, who have been entrenched on Geoje Island and Jeju Island for a long time and have been bullying the prisoners of war, are constantly interfering as your so-called representatives, threatening the prisoners of war, so our side's explanation work has never been able to proceed normally. Since November 17th, in order to maintain the special agent organization, your side's special agents have publicly resisted the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's separation of explained and unexplained prisoners of war in accordance with the 'Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visitation Work', completely halting our side's explanation work.

In order to implement your side's conspiracy to direct special agents to prevent prisoners of war from listening to the explanation, and to facilitate your side's arbitrary illegal activities to undermine the 'Terms of Reference,' your side publicly threatened the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Force not to take effective measures, including necessary force, in accordance with the provisions of the 'Terms of Reference' to stop the illegal activities of the special agents and ensure the implementation of the 'Terms of Reference.' Your side even openly stated that if the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Force used necessary force to restore and exercise their legitimate rights to punish special agents and control the camp, your side would attack them. At the Military Armistice Commission meeting on December 1st, under our side's questioning, your side claimed to be 'willing to agree to any reasonable actions that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Force deem necessary to take to punish special agents.' However, after that meeting, your side once again publicly threatened the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Force not to use necessary force to deal with the special agents, claiming that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Force's efforts to stop the activities of the special agents in the Tongjang-ri prisoner of war camp 'have exceeded the scope that we consider reasonable.' Your side is clearly attempting to continue to obstruct the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Force from exercising their legitimate powers, so that your side can continue to direct the special agents to carry out the heinous activities of undermining the 'Terms of Reference.'

The serious responsibility for the complete destruction of the 'Terms of Reference' and the inability to implement it must be borne by your side.

Your side is now directing special agents in the Tongjang-ri prisoner of war camp to undermine the explanation work, making it impossible to proceed, while at the same time deliberately delaying the talks between the two sides on the political conference issue in Panmunjom, attempting to postpone the convening of the political conference for a long time. At the same time, your side is openly clamoring for the absurd argument that 'the explanation period should end on December 22nd' and 'prisoners of war should be released as civilians on January 21st.' This fully demonstrates that your side is systematically undermining the explanation work, delaying the political conference, and attempting to unilaterally handle, that is, forcibly detain our captured personnel.

It must be emphasized that the 'Terms of Reference' clearly stipulates that the explanation work should commence immediately after the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission takes custody of all prisoners of war, and should have a period of ninety days. The 'Terms of Reference' also clearly stipulates that the handling of prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to be repatriated should be resolved by the political conference within thirty days. Clause 11 of the 'Terms of Reference,' which stipulates that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission should release the prisoners of war after 120 days of custody, making them civilians, is clearly premised on the above-mentioned clauses in the 'Terms of Reference.' Your side obstructs the timely commencement of the explanation work, undermines the normal progress of the explanation work, and even makes our side's explanation work completely stalled; on the other hand, in the bilateral talks, it is trying to postpone the convening of the political conference, attempting to avoid discussing and resolving the prisoner of war issue in the political conference, so as to unilaterally handle it, that is, forcibly detain it. I must solemnly declare here that our side's explanation work has failed to commence on schedule and proceed normally without interruption in accordance with the provisions of the 'Terms of Reference' due to your side's direct obstruction and the sabotage of the special agents arranged and directed by your side, and has fallen into a state where it is impossible to proceed at all. Therefore, a political conference should be convened quickly to discuss and resolve the prisoner of war issue. However, no matter when the political conference is convened, the handling of prisoners of war who have not exercised their right to repatriation must be discussed and resolved in the political conference, and your side is absolutely not allowed to handle it unilaterally, and your side's conspiracy to delay the political conference and forcibly detain prisoners of war will absolutely not be allowed to succeed.”

    朝鲜军事停战委员会七日举行会议
    李相朝将军斥美方破坏解释工作
    声明必须迅速召开政治会议解决战俘问题
    【新华社开城七日电】朝鲜军事停战委员会朝中代表团发表公报如下：“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”明确规定：朝鲜停战双方向一切依附于其本方的不直接遣返的战俘所进行的解释工作，应于中立国遣返委员会接管全部战俘后即行开始，并应有九十天的时间，而在经过解释后尚未行使遣返权利之战俘的处理问题，应交由政治会议在三十天内设法解决。
    但美方始则延不修建解释设备，推迟了朝中方面解释工作之开始达十九天之久，继又指挥其特务不让战俘听取解释，并威胁中立国遣返委员会不得采取有效措施制裁特务，从而造成朝中方面解释工作自开始以来的屡次长期中断，乃至于目前根本无法进行的情况。而另一方面，美方现又正在板门店双方关于政治会议问题的会谈中故意拖延，企图长期推迟政治会议的召开。与此同时，美方竟公然叫嚣其所谓“解释期限应于十二月二十二日终止”，“战俘应于一月二十一日释放为平民”的荒谬论调。这充分说明美方正有计划地破坏解释工作，拖延政治会议，企图强迫扣留朝中被俘人员。
    在十二月七日的军事停战委员会上，朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将郑重声明：朝中方面的解释工作，既已由于美方的直接阻挠及美方所布置与指挥的特务之破坏而未能依照“职权范围”的规定按期开始和不中断地正常进行，并已陷于根本无法进行的状态，因此应即迅速召开政治会议，讨论并解决战俘问题。但不论政治会议何时召开，尚未行使遣返权利的战俘的处理问题必须在政治会议中讨论和解决，决不容许美方片面处理。美方拖延政治会议强迫扣留战俘的阴谋，是绝不容许实现的。
    李相朝中将主要发言全文如下：
    “你方直接指使李蒋特务进行种种破坏活动，使我方的解释工作一再陷于长期停顿，乃至于根本无法进行。你方威胁中立国遣返委员会不得采取有效措施制裁特务，使中立国遣返委员会不能执行‘职权范围’的决定。你方竟还企图曲解‘职权范围’，在十二月二十二日停止解释工作，在一九五四年一月二十一日片面解除战俘的身份，实质上乃是强迫扣留全部战俘。我必须首先指出：我方决不同意你方这种强迫扣留战俘的阴谋。
    你方不顾‘职权范围’的规定与我方的一再严重警告，布置了大批特务冒充战俘混入东场里战俘营，你方深恐这些特务为我方所识破，迄今未向我方提交你方声称已移交中立国遣返委员会看管的战俘名单。在这些特务混入战俘营后，你方又使各种非法手段保持联系，直接指挥。你方偷运无线电机入战俘营，以密码与特务联系。你方派遣特务往来于汉城与东场里战俘营之间。你方与你方军事控制地区向东场里战俘营的特务发出各种旗语与信号。你方以美军第六十四野战医院作为战俘营内外的特务进行联络的大本营。通过这种种的非法手段，你方继续指挥特务在战俘营内维持恐怖统治，以残无人道的暴力破坏解释工作，阻挠战俘遣返。印度看管部队所截获的你方向战俘营中的特务发出的指示信件，不容你方抵赖，完全证明了你方彻底破坏 ‘职权范围’的非法活动。
    早在战俘移交中立国遣返委员会接管前，你方即已积极布置了破坏解释工作的种种步骤。在中立国遣返委员会接管战俘后，你方即延不修建适当的解释设备，提出了荒谬的修建所需时间，蓄意拖延解释工作的开始。只是在我方的彻底揭露与中立国遣返委员会的坚决反对下，你方才不得不最后按照中立国遣返委员会的要求进行解释营场的修建，但已使解释工作的开始推迟了十九天。自十月十五日我方解释工作开始以来，你方更直接指使特务破坏解释工作，甚至于根本不让战俘听取解释，造成我方解释工作屡次的长期中断。迄今为止，我方的解释工作只能进行了七次，总共实际解释时间尚不足四十三小时，而即在这四十三小时内，你方特务也挟持战俘大吵大闹，背诵咒语。你方以长期盘据在巨济岛与济州岛欺压战俘的李、蒋特务为你方所谓代表，不断进行干扰，威胁战俘，我方的解释工作因而始终未能正常进行。自从十一月十七日以来，你方特务为保持特务组织，更公然抗拒中立国遣返委员会按照‘解释和访问工作细则’隔离已经解释与未经解释的战俘，使我方解释工作完全陷于停顿。
    为贯彻你方指挥特务不让战俘听取解释的阴谋，便于你方恣意进行破坏‘职权范围’的非法活动，你方公然威胁中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队不得根据‘职权范围’的规定采取有效措施，包括必要的武力，以制止特务的非法活动，保证‘职权范围’的实施。你方甚至公开表示：如中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队为恢复和行使其制裁特务和控制营场的合理权利而使用必要的武力，则你方将向它们进击。在十二月一日的军事停战委员会上，在我方质问之下，你方曾声称‘愿意对中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队为制裁特务认为有必要采取的任何合理行动表示同意’。而就在那一次会后，你方竟又一次公开威胁中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队不得使用必要的武力来对付特务，声称中立国遣返委员会与印度看管部队在东场里战俘营制止特务活动的努力，‘已经超出我们所认为合理的范围之外’。你方显然企图继续阻挠中立国遣返委员会与印度看管部队行使其合法权力，以便你方继续指挥特务进行破坏‘职权范围’的罪恶活动。
  ‘职权范围’之遭受彻底破坏而无法付诸实施，其严重责任必须由你方担负。
    你方现在一面指挥东场里战俘营内特务破坏解释工作，使解释工作无法进行，一面又在板门店双方关于政治会议问题的会谈中故意拖延，企图长期推迟政治会议的召开。与此同时，你方公然叫嚣
  ‘解释期限应于十二月二十二日终止’，‘战俘应于一月二十一日释放为平民’的荒谬论调。这充分说明你方是有计划地破坏解释工作，拖延政治会议，企图片面处理亦即强迫扣留我方被俘人员。
      必须强调指出：‘职权范围’明确规定：解释工作应在中立国遣返委员会接管全部战俘后即行开始，并应有九十天的时间。‘职权范围’并明确规定未行使被遣返权利之战俘的处理问题应交由政治会议在三十天内设法解决。‘职权范围’第十一款关于中立国遣返委员会接管战俘一百二十天后解除战俘身份使之成为平民的规定，显然是以‘职权范围’中上述款项为前提的。你方一面阻挠解释工作的按期开始，破坏解释工作的正常进行，乃至使我方解释工作根本陷于停顿；另一面在双方会谈中，又正力图推迟政治会议的召开，企图逃避在政治会议中讨论和解决战俘问题，以便于你方片面予以处理，亦即强迫予以扣留。我必须在此郑重声明：我方的解释工作，既已由于你方的直接阻挠和你方所布置和指挥的特务的破坏，未能依照‘职权范围’的规定按期开始和不中断地正常进行，并已陷于根本无法进行的情况，因此应即迅速召开政治会议讨论并解决战俘问题。但不论政治会议何时召开，尚未行使遣返权利的战俘处理问题必须在政治会议中讨论和解决，决不容许你方片面处理，而你方拖延政治会议强迫扣留战俘的阴谋，是决不容许实现的。”
