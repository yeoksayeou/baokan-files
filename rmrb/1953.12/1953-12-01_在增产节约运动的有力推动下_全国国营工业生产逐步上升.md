Under the Powerful Promotion of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign, National State-Owned Industrial Production Gradually Rises

[This newspaper reports] Since the national state-owned and local state-owned industries have deeply launched the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign, the production situation has improved, and production has gradually risen. According to statistics from the State Statistical Bureau, of the twenty-four major industrial products belonging to the five central industrial ministries, nineteen products exceeded the state plan in September, and in October, when the production tasks were heavier than in any previous month, fifteen products also exceeded the state plan. These two months were the best months for completing the production plan this year. In October, the output of major products of enterprises under the Ministry of Heavy Industry increased by about 10% compared with September; thirteen of the eighteen major products exceeded the monthly plan. From November 1st to 20th, state-owned coal mines had completed 72.4% of the full month's plan, an increase of 7.4% compared with the same period in October. The production of major products of state-owned light industry has generally increased. Taking the actual output from September 10th to 20th as 100, the actual output of each product in the same period in October was: pulp 106.29, paper 110.57, automobile tires 118.08, rickshaw tires 114.85, rubber shoes 107.57, cigarettes 110.15, and glucose 109.03. The production situation of local state-owned industries has also improved significantly. For example, among the fourteen important products of local state-owned industries in the North China region, except for cotton yarn and paper, all others exceeded the October plan. In the Northwest region, forty-eight local state-owned and jointly-owned factories and mines exceeded the total output value plan for production increase and economy by an average of 6.2% in October. In October, the quality of many state-owned and local state-owned industrial products also improved significantly.

During the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign, all industrial departments paid attention to reducing costs and developing sales work, resulting in great improvements in completing financial plans. The central heavy industry system did not complete the financial plan from January to August this year, but completed 103.93% of the monthly plan in September. In terms of cost, according to a comprehensive statistic of ninety-two enterprises, the average decrease was 4.35% compared with the plan; sales revenue in September completed 103.77% of the plan. The production cost of the state-owned coal mine system decreased by 11.4% in September, with a total cost reduction value of 53.9 billion yuan. State-owned coal mines in the Northeast region began to reverse the serious overspending situation.

The Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign promoted further improvement in production management in various enterprises. In June this year, the Fushun Mining Bureau refused to accept the task of increasing coal production by 100,000 tons; after the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign began, after detailed calculations by all employees of the mine, it was possible to increase production by 200,000 tons. The bureau also took some measures to improve production management and increase the efficiency of tunneling and recovery, and can increase production by another 150,000 tons. The Shanghai Cotton Spinning Factory strengthened production management in the campaign, and the yarn breakage rate of most factories has decreased; three factories have reduced it to below 100 breaks. In the past, the Dalian Machine Tool Factory often affected the production progress of other workshops due to insufficient capacity in the first machining workshop. After the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign was launched, the factory changed the labor organization of the machining workshop, implemented joint work sections, and adjusted the tasks of the first and second machining workshops. As a result, not only can it guarantee the completion of this year's plan, but it can also increase the production of ten eight-foot lathes. Several electrolysis plants in the chemical industry system can increase the production of 15 tons of caustic soda per day after improving technical management.

The vast number of employees in various enterprises have played a great enthusiasm and creativity in the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign. Cai Liancheng, an assistant steelmaker at the Tangshan Steel Plant, created the "deep blowing first, then surface blowing" converter operation method, which greatly reduced the consumption rate of pig iron and can save 20.38 billion yuan annually. The deputy chief engineer of the Tianjin Waterworks Company studied advanced Soviet experience and successfully tested the "chloramine" disinfection method, which solved the water quality problems that had not been solved for several years and can save more than 250 million yuan annually. The Zhangjiakou Flour Mill successfully tried the method of removing bran before milling, and produced four or five catties more of the same quality flour per hundred catties of wheat than "85" flour; if this method is promoted in thirteen flour mills in Hebei Province, the same amount of wheat can be used to increase flour production by 140 million catties a year. After the Chongqing Diesel Engine Factory launched the competition, Guo Guangrong, a member of the Communist Youth League, reduced the time for machining pistons from 18 hours to 2 hours and 50 minutes. Hui Xiufang, a female worker in the molding workshop of the state-owned Northeast Rubber Factory No. 4, adopted reasonable operating methods, and the daily output of rubber shoes increased from 120 pairs to 180 pairs, and all products were qualified. Chen Dexuan, an old carpenter at the Wuchang Shipyard, created a successful scribing device, which increased work efficiency by more than tenfold. Employees of the Hailar Dairy Chemical Factory in Inner Mongolia used whey (waste products after refining butter and casein) to extract laxatives, which can produce 1,700 kilograms per month, and can increase production for the country by 255 million yuan in the fourth quarter alone.

The Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign has been able to develop rapidly and achieve remarkable results, mainly because various departments and most enterprises have conscientiously implemented the spirit of the Party Central Committee's instructions, correctly brought into play the enthusiasm of the masses, and prevented blindness in production. Generally, units that have done a better job have the following experiences: 1. Deeply mobilize the masses and pay attention to bringing into play the role of technical personnel and functional institutions; 2. Pay attention to the balance of supply, production and sales, improve operations, and improve financial work; 3. Pay attention to strengthening planning management and technical management, and tap the potential strength of enterprises; 4. Promote advanced experience; 5. Combine the current Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign with the preparation of next year's plan and the preparation for the first quarter of next year's production.

However, the development of the campaign is still not balanced. Some enterprises have not truly mobilized all employees, or the employees are very enthusiastic, but the leadership does not know where to start, so they cannot see significant results. Some units have not well grasped the spirit of the Party Central Committee's instructions, and abnormal phenomena in production continue to develop, or they have deviated from the original work deployment, only caring about production and not about maintenance, only focusing on production and not paying attention to safety; some only care about increasing production and not about practicing economy, or neglect quality, neglect reserves, neglect resources, and neglect the source of raw materials and product sales. For example, in order to rush the task, the blast furnace workshop of Benxi Iron and Steel Company did not carry out maintenance, and serious air leakage and fire occurred at the top of the blast furnace. The open hearth workshop of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant rushed production, and steel was often produced at low temperatures, resulting in a large number of defective products. In order to rush the task, the Rubber Factory No. 7 produced unqualified automobile tires. The average daily output of unqualified products in September was 16.7, and in the first half of October, the average daily output increased to 26.4. Due to neglecting the cleaning system, the unqualified products of Jinzhou Paper Mill reached 80% in early October. The Shandong Coal Industry System neglected safe production, and serious accidents resulting in four deaths have occurred from October 1st to 16th. The Shenyang Screw Factory does not pay attention to the production of screws, and is not active in accepting new tasks, but blindly produces grinding machines and grinding wheels that have been heavily stockpiled, making it impossible to complete the financial plan.

Now there is only one month left until the end of the year, and the tasks to be completed by various enterprises are still very heavy. Factories and mines that have carried out the Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign well are working hard to consolidate their existing achievements and strive to over fulfill the plan. Units where the campaign has not been carried out well are stepping up mobilization and helping workshop cadres (including technical personnel and department personnel) to take effective measures in light of specific circumstances; at the same time, various enterprises have begun to pay attention to preventing the bad phenomena of rushing production at the end of the year, neglecting safety, and neglecting normal reserves.

    在增产节约运动的有力推动下
    全国国营工业生产逐步上升
    【本报讯】全国国营和地方国营工业，深入开展增产节约运动以来，生产情况好转，生产逐步上升。据国家统计局的统计，中央五个工业部所属企业的二十四种主要工业产品，九月份有十九种产品的产量超额完成了国家计划，生产任务比过去任何一个月都重的十月份也有十五种产品的产量超额完成了国家计划，而且这两个月是今年完成生产计划较好的月份。十月份，重工业部所属企业的主要产品的产量比九月份增加百分之十左右；十八种主要产品，有十三种超额完成了月度计划。国营煤矿从十一月一日到二十日已完成全月计划的百分之七十二点四，和十月同期比较，产量增加了百分之七点四。国营轻工业的主要产品的生产已普遍提高，如以九月十日到二十日的实际产量为一○○，十月份的同期各产品的实际产量为：纸浆一○六·二九，纸张一一○·五七，汽车外胎一一八·○八，人力车外胎一一四·八五，胶鞋一○七·五七，卷烟一一○·一五，葡萄糖一○九·○三。地方国营工业生产情况也显著好转。如华北区地方国营工业的十四种重要产品中，除棉纱和纸外，其他都超额完成了十月份计划。西北区有四十八个地方国营和公私合营厂矿，平均超额百分之六·二完成了十月份生产与增产节约的总产值计划。十月份，许多国营和地方国营工业产品质量也显著提高。
    在增产节约运动中，各工业部门都注意降低成本和开展销售工作，因而在完成财务计划方面有很大的改进。中央重工业部系统今年一月到八月份都没有完成财务计划，九月份完成了月计划百分之一○三·九三；在成本方面，据九十二个企业综合统计，平均比计划降低了百分之四·三五；九月份销售收入完成计划百分之一○三·七七。国营煤矿系统的生产成本九月份降低了百分之一一·四，降低成本费共值五百三十九亿元。东北区国营煤矿开始扭转了严重的超支情况。
    增产节约运动推动各企业进一步改进了生产管理工作。今年六月间，抚顺矿务局不肯接受增产十万吨煤的任务；增产节约运动开始后，经过全矿职工的详细计算，可增产二十万吨。该局并采取了一些措施，改进了生产管理，提高了掘进和回收效率，还可以再增产十五万吨。上海棉纺厂在运动中加强了生产管理，大部分厂的细纱断头率已下降；有三个厂已下降到一百根以下。大连机床厂过去因第一加工车间能力不足，经常影响其他车间的生产进度。增产节约运动开展后，该厂改变了加工车间的劳动组织，实行联合工段，并将第一、二两加工车间的任务进行调整，结果不但可以保证完成今年的计划，并可增产八呎车床十台。化学工业系统的几个电解工厂，改进技术管理后，每天可增产烧碱十五吨。
    各企业广大职工在增产节约运动中发挥了极大的积极性和创造性。唐山钢厂炼钢工助手蔡连成创造了“先深吹，后面吹”的转炉操作法，使生铁消耗率大大降低，全年可节约二百零三亿八千万元。天津自来水公司副总工程师学习苏联先进经验，试验“氯胺”消毒法成功，解决了几年来不能解决的水质问题，全年可节约二亿五千多万元。张家口面粉厂试用先除麸皮制粉法成功，每百斤麦子比“八五”粉多出品质相同的四、五斤面；这个方法如在河北省十三个面粉厂推广，一年就可用同量小麦增产面粉一亿四千万斤。重庆柴油机厂开展竞赛后，青年团员郭光荣车活塞的时间从十八小时降到二小时五十分。国营东北橡胶四厂成型车间女工惠秀芳，采用了合理的操作方法，胶鞋日产量由一百二十双提高到一百八十双，产品全部合格。武昌造船厂老木工陈德煊创造划线器成功，工作效率提高了十倍以上。内蒙古海拉尔牛乳化工厂职工利用乳清水（炼过奶油和酪胶的废品）提炼泻剂，每月可产一千七百公斤，仅第四季度就可给国家增产二亿五千五百万元。
    增产节约运动能够迅速地开展，并取得了显著成绩，主要是各部门和大多数企业单位认真贯彻了党中央的指示精神，正确地发挥了群众的积极性，防止了生产方面的盲目性。一般做得较好的单位都有下面几点经验：一、深入发动群众，注意发挥技术人员和职能机构的作用；二、注意供、产、销平衡，改进经营，改进财务工作；三、注意加强计划管理与技术管理，发掘企业潜在力量；四、推广先进经验；五、把目前增产节约运动同明年计划的编制工作和明年第一季度生产的准备工作结合起来。
    但是，目前运动的发展还不够平衡，有些企业还没有真正把职工全面发动起来，或者职工劲头很大而领导方面不知从何下手，所以还看不到显著的效果。有些单位没有很好掌握党中央指示的精神，生产中的不正常的现象还在继续发展，或者脱离了原来的工作部署，只顾生产不顾检修，只重生产不注意安全；有的只管增产不顾节约，或者忽视质量、忽视储备、忽视资源和忽视原材料来源以及产品销路。如本溪钢铁公司高炉车间，为了赶任务不进行检修，高炉炉顶发生严重的漏气发火现象。太原钢铁厂平炉车间突击生产，经常发生低温出钢，造成大量废品。橡胶七厂为了赶任务，制出的汽车外胎，不合格的产品在九月份平均每日有一六·七条，到十月份上半月平均每日增加到二六·四条。锦州纸厂由于忽视清洁制度，十月上旬不合格品达百分之八十。山东煤业系统忽视安全生产，十月一日到十六日已发生死亡四人的严重事故。沈阳螺钉厂不重视生产螺钉，接受新任务时也不积极，却盲目生产已大量积压的磨床及砂轮机，使财务计划不能完成。
    现在离年底只有一个月了，各企业要完成的任务还很繁重。增产节约运动开展得较好的厂矿正在努力巩固已有的成绩，争取超额完成计划。运动开展得较差的单位，正在加紧发动和帮助车间干部（包括技术人员与科室人员），针对具体情况采取有效措施；各企业同时已开始注意防止年终突击生产、忽视安全以及忽视正常储备的不良现象。
