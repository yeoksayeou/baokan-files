People Who Work Hard for the Industrialization of the Motherland
    Rescuing Mine Accidents Regardless of Personal Safety

    Zhang Jie, a worker in the water and sand filling team of the Fifth Mine of the Xinqiu Coal Mine in Fuxin, was checking the safety of the equipment along the roadway at 3:00 AM one day in mid-September. He had not walked far when he suddenly heard the sound of rushing water beneath his feet. He quickly followed the sound of the water. When he reached the water storage pit, he discovered a stream of water as thick as a bowl breaking through the dam and rushing out with great force. At this time, he was empty-handed, and there was no one else nearby. He had no choice but to take off his clothes and plug the opening. As Zhang Jie firmly planted his feet on the clothes blocking the hole, he remembered that he still had his newly issued salary of over six million yuan in his pocket. By this time, the opening had expanded to half a foot wide and two feet long, and the water had risen from his knees to his waist. He thought: The deep part of this roadway is the supply route for the Quan Zhitian excavation team. To increase production and conserve resources, they have already improved excavation efficiency. If I lifted my foot to get the money, not only would their supply route be flooded, but the lives of many workers would also be in danger. Thinking of this, he stood even more firmly. At that time, it was already late autumn, and the water was very cold. Zhang Jie stood naked in the water for an hour, shivering all over. He almost fainted several times. After a while, water also began to flow down from the cracks in the roof of the roadway, pouring onto Zhang Jie's head. Zhang Jie knew that if it flowed like this for two or three hours, the roof would definitely collapse, and his life would be in danger. At this time, he thought of the heroes on the Korean front line and resolved: It doesn't matter if I die, as long as I protect the roadway and the lives of other workers.

    Two hours later, the workers working in the deep part of the roadway discovered the accident and rushed over. By this time, Zhang Jie had almost completely lost consciousness. The workers helped him out of the water and unanimously thanked and praised his selfless behavior. Zhang Jie struggled to say, "It's nothing, I am a Communist Party member, I should do this!" (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    Laying the Foundation for Our Future Generations

    In the construction of the Anshan Iron and Steel Large Rolling Mill, workers paid great attention to quality, placing quality first even in the backfilling project. Worker An Tingxi said, "The quality of the finishing touches is even more important." Sun Wanyi's team was backfilling the floor, and the quality requirement was to tamp three times per step or one and a half times per step. However, their team tamped it four times back and forth. Young League members Chen Junjie and Li Zaifu saw wood chips in the soil and picked them out while encouraging everyone, saying, "This is laying the foundation for our future generations, we cannot let these things affect the foundation's lifespan." After inspection by the inspection station comrades, everyone believed that this was unprecedented high quality. The Second Construction Area implemented "tamping step by step" in the backfilling project, raising the rammer high and hitting it tightly to ensure no subsidence, which was a great improvement in quality compared to the previous three tamps per step and one and a half tamps per step.

    "I will not go home to get married until the large mill is completed!"

    There was a twenty-year-old youth earth digger, Xin Youtai, at the construction site of the Anshan Iron and Steel Large Rolling Mill. When he returned home for the Spring Festival, he agreed with his lover to get married during the Mid-Autumn Festival. Before the Mid-Autumn Festival, his lover sent several letters in succession, saying in the letters: "You should buy some things and go home to get married no matter what during the Mid-Autumn Festival; if the task is really busy, go back quickly after getting married." Xin Youtai was always reluctant to leave the construction site. He thought, "The people of the whole country are watching Anshan Iron and Steel, we should exert all our strength to answer the hopes of the people of the whole country. The large mill is a key project of the country's first Five-Year Plan!" So he challenged in the team: "I will not go home to get married until the large mill is completed!" Under the influence of his patriotic actions, the entire team comprehensively completed the task. (Yang Shutang)

    Painstakingly Collecting Waste Materials to Install a Lathe

    The equipment of the Changchun 303 Factory was simple, and various shafts and large ironwork could not be made, so they had to be processed in outside iron factories. Some iron factories disliked the scattered work and were often delayed for several months, and the prices were also high, which often affected the factory's production. Li Zonghai was a worker in the maintenance workshop of the 303 Factory and often kept this matter in mind. He thought, "The country's first Five-Year Plan has begun. If I solve this problem, wouldn't it be a contribution to the country!" So he made up his mind: to install a lathe with waste materials and do large ironwork himself.

    Starting in April of this year, Li Zonghai came early and left late, using his rest time to collect a lot of old materials. But he didn't understand the installation technology, and he couldn't figure it out for several days. One day after work, he was walking and thinking, when suddenly he had an inspiration. He spent 83,000 yuan at a bookstore to buy two books on mechanics. Li Zonghai went home and didn't bother to eat. He read books and drew pictures. His lover said, "I haven't seen you earn much money, why are you always busier than others?" Li Zonghai said, "If the lathe is successfully installed, it can increase production and conserve resources for the country; when the country is rich, our lives will be better!" After several months of work, he finally successfully installed the lathe. With this lathe, Li Zonghai's team can increase production and conserve 50 million yuan for the country by the end of the year. (Zhang Wenfan)

    Enduring Hardships to Find Oil for the Motherland

    In the great northwest of the motherland, there are more than fifty geological work teams searching for oil for the motherland this year. Once, a prospecting team had to enter an area of more than forty square kilometers to work. There was no water source in this area, and everyone could not all move in, so it was decided to go in separately. Technician Liu Renrui and his companion set off with only a piece of tarpaulin, a leather coat, four water bottles, and some cold steamed buns. Their task was to make a geological map of this area. The two of them looked in the right direction and kept moving forward, climbing up and down between peaks and cliffs all the way. The climate in this area was very strange. In the deep valleys, the sun made them sweat profusely, but as soon as they climbed to the top of the mountain, their hands were so cold that they hurt. They walked for a while and stopped to work for a while. They walked thirty-five kilometers that day and could no longer return to the tent. They had to spread the tarpaulin on the wet grass, cover themselves with leather coats, and sleep with a stone as a pillow. In the middle of the night, they were awakened by a burst of rain. The sky was already covered with dark clouds. They quickly held the tarpaulin over their heads and wrapped their bodies in leather coats, anxiously waiting for dawn. When it dawned, a fiery red sun rose in the east. They encouraged each other and said, "Hurry up and do more work while the weather is clear." So they ate the remaining cold steamed buns and cold water to fill their hunger, and began another day's work. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    Gu Jinshui Risks His Life to Rescue Comrades

    At a construction site of the Shaanxi 105 Engineering Team, on September 29th, when scaffolding was being erected for the west section of a large building, a large round log more than two zhang long slid off the second layer of scaffolding, and it was about to hit two bricklayers who were building a wall below. In this very emergency situation, bricklayer Gu Jinshui quickly ran under the scaffolding and used his body to knock the round log aside, ensuring the safety of the two workers, but he himself sprained his back. Comrades persuaded him to rest for a while, but he refused, saying, "If I stop working because of this minor illness, how can I complete the construction task and be worthy of the country and the people?" (Yu Zhongmin)

    A Cigarette

    In October of this year, employees of the Southwest 101 Factory received a carton of Zhonghua brand cigarettes sent from Korea. This carton of cigarettes was originally given by the delegation to comfort the Korean Volunteer Army to Qiu Shaoyun's company. But when the soldiers heard the report of the delegation and were elated by the great construction of the motherland, they gave it to the heroic models in the construction of the motherland.

    The cigarettes were distributed to the various workshops of the 101 Factory. Wu Sanyuan, a labor model in the steelmaking plant, also received one. He struck the match several times, but he did not light it. He thought: "Now is not the time to smoke this cigarette! I'll smoke it after completing the October task." After arduous efforts, the October task was completed. He opened the cigarette case several times, but several times he thought: The volunteers are so arduous, how can I easily smoke the cigarette they sent? So he decided to fight another battle before smoking it.

    On November 11th, the clang of the bell suddenly rang, and people shouted: The ladle is leaking, rescue the molten steel! I saw a person running out of the crowd without even wearing goggles. He held an oxygen lance in his hand and rushed straight to the leaking hole in the ladle. Steel flowers were splashing, and molten steel was constantly flowing. He rushed bravely to the steel ladle, holding the oxygen lance, and "burned" at the leak. People held their breath and watched his heroic actions. Several minutes later, the molten steel stopped leaking! Wu Sanyuan, wearing sweat-soaked clothes, walked safely towards everyone with the oxygen lance in his hand. Cheers rang out throughout the field, and the workers surrounded him to express their sympathy. Someone asked him what he was thinking at the time? Wu Sanyuan replied very simply, he said:

    "I just touched my cigarette case, looked at the leaking molten steel, and then ran up."

    On this day, in the study room, Wu Sanyuan struck a match and lit this "Zhonghua" brand cigarette sent all the way from Korea. (Zhang Daquan)

    为祖国工业化而艰苦奋斗的人们
    奋不顾身抢救巷道事故
    阜新新邱煤矿五坑水矿充填班工人张杰，在九月中旬的一天夜里三点钟，顺着巷道检查设备的安全情形。他走不多远，猛听到脚下哗喇哗喇的流水声，就急忙顺着水流去找。他走到贮水坑前，发现一股碗口粗的水突破仓堤冲出来了，水势很猛。这时，他两手空空，附近也没有人，只好把衣服脱下来堵到水口上。张杰在两脚紧紧踏牢那堵在洞口上的衣服时，才想到衣袋里还装着刚发下来的六十多万元工资。这时水口已扩大成半尺宽两尺长的大洞了，水也从他的膝盖涨到了腰部。他想：这个巷道的深部就是全志田掘进队的送道，为了增产节约，他们已经提高了掘进效率，如果我一抬脚取钱，不光他们的送道被淹没，很多工人的命也保不住了。想到这些，他更加牢牢地站定。当时已经是秋末的气候，水很凉。张杰光着身子在水里站了一个钟头，冻得浑身发抖，有好几次差一点昏倒。过了不久，巷道顶板缝里也哗喇哗喇地流下水来，浇到张杰头上。张杰知道：只要这样流上两、三个钟头，顶板一定会塌落，性命就危险了。这时他想到朝鲜前线的英雄，就下定决心：我死了不要紧，只要保全了巷道和别的工人的性命就行。
    两个钟头以后，在巷道深度工作的工人们发觉出了事故以后赶来了。这时，张杰差不多已经完全失去了知觉，工人们把他从水里扶出，一致感激和赞扬他这种舍己为公的行为。张杰挣扎着说：“算不了什么，我是共产党员，应该这样做！”        （据新华社讯）
    给我们后代打基础
    在鞍钢大型轧钢厂建设工程中，工人们非常重视质量，就是在回填土工程中也把质量放到了第一位。工人安廷喜说：“编筐织篓，全在收口；结尾工程质量更重要。”孙万义小组作地坪回填土，按质量要求是一步三夯或一步一半夯，可是他们小组来回打了四遍。青年团员陈俊杰和李在富看到土里有木片，一边往外拣一边鼓励大家说：“这是给我们子孙后代打基础，不能让这些东西影响基础寿命。”经过检查站同志检查，大家认为这是从来没有过的优等质量。第二工区在回填土工程中实行了“挨步夯”，抬的高、打的紧，保证不下沉。比过去的一步三夯和一步一夯半的质量大大前进一步。    （杨述汤）
    “大型不竣工，决不回家去结婚！”
    鞍钢大型轧钢厂工地有一个二十岁的青年挖土工辛有太，在春节回家的时候，和爱人约定在中秋节结婚。中秋节前他爱人接连来过几封信，在信里说：“你要买些东西，中秋节无论如何回家结婚；如果任务实在忙，结完婚赶快回去。”辛有太总是舍不得离开工地，他想：“全国人民看着鞍钢，我们应发挥一切力量来回答全国人民对我们的希望。大型厂是国家第一个五年计划的重点工程啊！”于是他在小组里提出挑战：“大型不竣工，决不回家去结婚！”在他这种爱国行动影响之下，全小组全面完成了任务。（杨述汤）
    苦心搜集废料安装镟床
    长春三○三工厂设备简单，各种轴和大的铁活不能做，必须到外边铁工厂加工。有些铁工厂嫌活零碎不愿做，往往一拖就是几个月，价格也高，使该厂生产常受影响。李宗海是三○三厂保全车间的工人，把这事常常挂在心里，他想：“祖国第一个五年计划开始了，我如果把这个问题解决了，不是对国家的一个贡献吗！”于是他下了一个决心：用废料安装一个镟床，自己做大铁活。
    从今年四月开始，李宗海早来晚去，利用休息时间搜集了不少旧材料。但是他不懂得安装的技术，别了好几天也没办法。有一天下班后，他一边走路一边想，忽然灵机一动，到书店花了八万三千元买了两本机械方面的书。李宗海回家顾不得吃饭，一边看书一边画图。他的爱人说：“没看你多挣几个钱，为啥总比别人忙？”李宗海说：“镟床安装成功，能给国家增产节约；国家富了，咱们的生活就更好了！”经过几个月的工夫，他终于把镟床安装成功了。有了这台镟床，李宗海小组到年底能给国家增产节约五千万元。（张文范）
    不辞艰苦为祖国寻找石油
    在祖国大西北，今年有五十多个地质工作队为祖国找寻石油。有一次一个普查队要进入一个四十多平方公里的区域去工作。这个区域里没有水源，大家不能全部都迁入到里面去，后来便决定分头进去活动。技术员刘人瑞和他的同伴只带了一块油布、一件皮大衣、四个水壶和一些冷馒头就出发了。他们的任务是要做出这个区域的地质路线图。他们俩看好方向，一直地取道前进，一路都在峰峦削壁之间上下翻腾。这地区的气候很奇怪，在深谷里，太阳晒得直淌汗；可是一爬上山巅，又冻得手痛。他们就这样走一会，停下来工作一会。当天走了三十五公里，不能再回到帐篷去了，他们只得在湿漉漉的草地上铺上油布，盖上皮大衣，枕一块石头睡觉。夜半，他们被一阵骤雨惊醒，天空已是乌云密布，他们连忙把油布顶在头上，用皮大衣围着身子，眼巴巴等候天明。天亮了，东方升起火红的太阳来，他们互相鼓励说：“快吧，赶着天晴多做些工作。”于是拿昨天剩下的冷馍冷水充充饥，又开始了另一天的工作。（据新华社讯）
    顾金水冒险抢救同志
    陕西一○五工程队某工地，在九月二十九日搭大楼西段脚手架时，一根二丈多长的大圆木从二层架子上滑掉下来，眼看就要砸到下边正在砌墙的两个瓦工身上。在这非常紧急的情况下，瓦工顾金水很快跑到架子下面，用身子把圆木挡倒一边，保住那两个工人的安全，可是他自己却把腰闪痛了。同志们劝他休息一下，他不肯，说：“这点小病就停工作，怎能完成建设任务、对得起国家和人民呢？”
                                    （于忠民）
      一枝香烟
    今年十月间，西南一○一厂职工收到了从朝鲜寄来的一条中华牌香烟。这条香烟原是赴朝慰问团赠给志愿军邱少云连队的。但当战士们听了慰问团的报告，为祖国伟大建设而欢欣鼓舞，又把它转赠给在祖国建设事业中的英雄模范。
    香烟分到一○一厂各车间。炼钢场劳动模范吴三元也得了一枝，他几次擦燃了火柴，但都没有点着它。他想：“现在还不到抽这枝香烟的时候哩！等完成十月份任务再抽。”经过艰苦的努力，十月份任务完成了，他几次打开烟盒，但几次都想到：志愿军那样艰苦，我怎能把他们送来的烟轻易抽掉呢？于是他决定再打一次胜仗才抽它。
    十一月十一日，突然响起了噹噹的钟声，人们喊着：包子漏啦，抢救钢水呀！只见从人丛中跑出来一个连风镜都没来得及配戴的人。他手里拿着氧气枪，直往包子漏口冲去。钢花在飞溅，钢水在不住地流着。他勇猛地冲向盛钢桶，端着氧气枪，对准漏口就“烧”。人们都屏住气息看着他的英勇的动作。数分钟后，钢水不漏啦！吴三元穿着汗淋淋的衣服，端着氧气枪安然地向大家走来了。全场响起了欢呼声，工人们都围上去向他慰问。有人问他当时在想些什么？吴三元答复得很简单，他说：
  “只摸了摸我的烟盒，看了看漏出来的钢水，于是就跑上去了。”
    这一天在学习室里，吴三元擦燃了火柴，点着了这枝远从朝鲜寄来的“中华”牌的香烟。      （张大权）
