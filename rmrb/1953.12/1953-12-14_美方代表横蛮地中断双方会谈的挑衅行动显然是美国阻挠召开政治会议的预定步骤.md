Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 12th: A special correspondent for this agency reports: The US representative, Dean, interrupted the bilateral talks on the political conference issue this afternoon, indicating that the US government has no intention of holding a political conference. Dean's unilateral action to adjourn the talks indefinitely is clearly a pre-arranged step on Washington's "timetable" to obstruct the convening of a political conference, in order to achieve the goal of forcibly detaining more than 20,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, obstructing the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and maintaining international tension.

    After throwing out his "final proposal" four days ago, Dean was intent on creating excuses to interrupt the talks at today's meeting. He hinted yesterday that he hoped for an adjournment. Today, he repeatedly demanded that the Korean and Chinese representatives sign his so-called "draft proposal," which was full of delaying and sabotaging tricks, and had already been clearly pointed out and rejected by the Korean and Chinese representatives. Dean used provocative language, repeatedly trying to get the Korean and Chinese representatives to propose an adjournment. But when Dean saw that his provocation was not working on the Korean and Chinese representatives, he stormed out of the meeting room at 4:48 p.m., while the Chinese representative was still speaking, his face flushed with anger.

    Dean's first prepared statement lasted a total of one hour and fifty minutes. He ended with a provocative question: "I ask you again. Do you want to seriously discuss this matter? Or do you want to adjourn?" In this statement, Dean stubbornly demanded that unless his request to treat the Soviet Union as a belligerent country was met, he would not "be able" to reach an agreement on behalf of Syngman Rhee. Dean said: "Once you can guarantee to me that the Soviet Union will participate in the conference as a member with full voting rights and fulfill its solemn obligation regarding the unification of Korea as a signatory to the agreement reached at the conference, I can guarantee you that my draft proposal will be binding on the Republic of Korea without any doubt."

    The Korean and Chinese representatives reminded Dean: "In the notification of your agreement to hold bilateral talks, there was no mention of this surprising and bizarre prerequisite. At previous meetings, you have also boasted that you are the respected representative of the seventeen countries participating in the war against Korea." They asked Dean to answer this fundamental question: In the current negotiations, is he representing the Syngman Rhee government?

    Dean avoided answering and instead became enraged, rudely shouting: "You obviously don't know the rules of etiquette in this kind of discussion." He threatened: "Are you prepared to sign my draft proposal of December 8th with me today? Yes or no?" When the Korean and Chinese representatives asked Dean to give an answer to their question, Dean yelled: "I suggest an adjournment until you know politeness."

    The Korean and Chinese representatives were not affected by his provocation in the slightest. They continued to explain that it was important to answer the practical question they had raised. Dean had suggested that "each voting participant should only be bound by the specific agreements it abides by." If such agreements could be torn up at any time by the party that does not abide by them, then what is the point of reaching an agreement?

    Dean completely ignored this question and continued to carry out his pre-planned, unreasonable provocation. He shouted irrationally: "That's complete nonsense. Utter garbage. How much more nonsense are you going to spout?" He then issued an ultimatum: "I am presenting you with my draft proposal of December 8th. Please answer. Do you want to sign it, or do you want to adjourn?"

    The Korean and Chinese representatives patiently pointed out that our question regarding the US's proposed voting method was not a theoretical question but was based on facts. Syngman Rhee had blatantly violated the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's "Terms of Reference" and forcibly detained more than 20,000 prisoners of war. This act of bad faith, condemned by the whole world, occurred after US General Harrison, representing the United Nations Command, signed the "Terms of Reference," even though Harrison had guaranteed that the United Nations also represented the Syngman Rhee government.

    Dean even wanted to further break faith and write off this matter. He said that this matter was already in the past, and that we were raising it again purely for propaganda purposes. We solemnly pointed out that our General Nam Il had stated in his statement of July 19th that we would reserve the right to submit the incident of the US forcibly detaining 27,000 of our captured personnel to the political conference, and the US did not object at that time. Now Dean cannot unilaterally declare the US's forcible detention of tens of thousands of our captured personnel to be written off.

    Dean had nothing more to say, so he feigned great anger and shouted: "You are attacking my government for being disloyal. You know very well that this is not true. Unless you withdraw this statement, I will take it as a notification that you want an indefinite adjournment." Huang Hua calmly said to Dean: "If you are not willing to take responsibility for interrupting the negotiations, I suggest an adjournment until Monday." But Dean continued with his plan to interrupt the talks, saying: "Your accusation is not true, so I will take it as a notification that you want an indefinite adjournment." Dean then walked out of the meeting room immediately without listening to the response of the Korean and Chinese representatives.

    Dean's actions to interrupt the talks and dash the world's hopes for holding a political conference did not surprise observers here. Agence France-Presse had already reported from London on the 11th that the US was going to "stop" the bilateral talks within a few days. Observers here had long seen that Dean and Harrison were using the same tactic of closing the door to negotiations with "final proposals." Outside the meeting room, Dean made no secret of his intentions, boasting that he was "authorized to interrupt the talks at any time."

    Dean's extremely rude interruption of the meeting proves that the US government's intention, as announced in the joint communique of the Bermuda Conference, was false. The joint communique of the Bermuda Conference stated: "The current objective of our policy remains to be the convening of the political conference stipulated in the Korean Armistice Agreement."

    Dean's provocative actions thoroughly exposed Washington's attempt to obstruct the convening of a political conference in order to avoid this conference in order to forcibly detain our large number of captured personnel, while using this as a pretext to create international tension. All peace-loving people around the world must be seriously vigilant about this.

### 美方代表横蛮地中断双方会谈的挑衅行动显然是美国阻挠召开政治会议的预定步骤

    美方代表横蛮地中断双方会谈的挑衅行动显然是美国阻挠召开政治会议的预定步骤
    【新华社开城十二日电】本社特派记者报道：美方代表迪安今天下午中断了关于政治会议问题的双方会谈，这表明美国政府无意召开政治会议。迪安片面使会谈无限期休会的行动，显然是华盛顿“时间表”上预先安排好的一个步骤，以阻挠政治会议的召开，达到强迫扣留二万多名朝中战俘、阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题并保持国际紧张局势的目的。
    迪安在四天以前掷出了他的“最后建议”之后，在今天的会议上一心要想制造藉口来中断会谈。他昨天曾暗示他希望休会。今天他一再要求朝中方面代表在他的所谓“建议草案”上签字，这个
  “建议草案”充满着拖延和破坏的诡计，早经朝中代表明白予以指出，并予以拒绝。迪安使用了挑拨性的字句，一再要使朝中方面代表提出休会。但是当迪安看到他的挑衅对朝中方面代表不起作用时，便于下午四时四十八分，当中国代表还在发言时，满脸通红、怒气冲冲地走出了会议室。
    迪安的第一篇事先准备好的声明宣读了历时共一小时又五十分，他最后以一个挑衅性的问题结束：“我再问你方一遍。你方是否希望认真讨论？还是希望休会？”迪安在这篇声明中蛮横地要求，除非满足他的要求，把苏联作为一个交战国，否则他不“能够”代表李承晚达成协议。迪安说：“一待你方能够向我保证苏联作为一个具有充分表决权的参加国家参加会议，并且以会议所达成的协议的一个签字国身份执行其关于统一朝鲜的庄严义务，我便能够向你方保证，我的建议草案对大韩民国具有约束力一点是毫无疑问的。”
    朝中方面代表提醒迪安：“你方表示同意举行双方会谈的通知中，并没有提到这个令人吃惊的怪诞的先决条件。在历次会议上，你也一直吹嘘你是参加对朝鲜的战争的十七国的可敬的代表”。他们要求迪安回答这个基本问题：在目前谈判中，他是否代表李承晚政府。
    迪安避而不答，反而勃然大怒，粗鲁地叫道：
  “你们显然不知道在这种讨论中的礼仪规矩。”他威胁道：“你们准备今天与我一起在我十二月八日提出的建议草案上签字吗？是还是不是？”当朝中方面代表要求迪安对他们的问题给予一个答复时，迪安叫嚷道：“我建议休会到你们知道礼貌的时候为止。”
    朝中方面代表没有丝毫受到他的挑衅的影响。他们继续解释说，答复他们提出的这个实际问题是很重要的。迪安曾经建议“每一个有表决权的参加者应只受它所遵守的具体协议的约束”。如果这种协议随时可能为不遵守这种协议的方面所撕毁，那末达成协议又有什么作用呢？
    迪安根本不理会这个问题，继续按照他事先拟就的计划，进行无理的挑衅。他丧失理智似地叫道：
  “完全是胡说八道。完全是废话。你们到底要胡说八道到什么地步？”他接着提出了最后通牒说：“我向你们提出我十二月八日的建议草案。请你们答复。你们愿意签字，还是愿意休会？”
    朝中方面代表耐心地指出，我方关于美方主张的表决方式所提的问题并不是理论上的问题而是有事实根据的。李承晚曾经悍然违反中立国遣返委员会的“职权范围”强迫扣留两万多名战俘。这个为全世界所谴责的背信行动，是在美国将军哈利逊代表联合国军方面在“职权范围”上签字以后发生的，虽然哈利逊曾经保证联合国方面也代表着李承晚政府。
    迪安竟想进一步背信弃义把这件事情一笔钩销。他说这件事已经过去了，我方重提此事完全是为了宣传。我方严正指出，美方强迫扣留二万七千名我方被俘人员事件，我方南日大将曾在七月十九日声明中表示将保留提交政治会议，美方当时并未反对。现在迪安决不能片面宣布将美方这一强迫扣留我方数万被俘人员事件一笔钩销。
    迪安至此无话可说，于是故装大怒，大声叫道：“你们攻击我的政府背信。你们明知道这是不确实的。除非你们撤回这个话，否则我认为这是通知我：你们希望无限期休会。”黄华平静地对迪安说：“如果你不敢承担中断谈判的责任，我建议休会到星期一。”但是迪安继续进行他的中断会谈的计划，他说：“你们的指责是不确实的，因此我认为这是通知我：你们希望无限期休会。”迪安接着不听朝中方面代表的答复就立即走出会议室。
    迪安中断会谈和打击全世界对召开政治会议所抱的希望的行动，并没有使这里观察家感到意外。法新社在十一日已自伦敦报道说美方要在数日内将双方会谈“停止”。这里观察家早已看出迪安和哈利逊用“最后建议”来关闭谈判之门的手段是一模一样的。在会议室外，迪安毫不掩饰他的意图，他吹嘘说，他“受权可以随时中断会谈”。
    迪安极端横蛮地中断会议的行动，证明了美国政府在百慕大会议联合公报中所宣布的意愿是虚假的。百慕大会议联合公报曾说：“我们政策的当前目标依然是召开朝鲜停战协定所规定的政治会议。”
    迪安的挑衅行动彻底暴露了华盛顿企图阻挠政治会议的召开以便躲开这个会议来强迫扣留我方大批被俘人员，同时借此制造国际紧张局势。全世界爱好和平人民对此必须严重警惕。
