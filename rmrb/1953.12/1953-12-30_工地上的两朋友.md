Two Friends on the Construction Site
By our reporter Zhu Bo

At first, no one believed that Ding Chengzhi, the fitter foreman, and Xiao Qingduan, the technician, would become friends, because everyone knew that there were too many differences between them. Take Ding Chengzhi for example. He left his poor family as a teenager to learn fitter skills in the factory, and now he has sixteen or seventeen years of fitter work experience. Although he has been a fitter for so long and has installed many machines, he doesn't understand the structure of the machines at all; he doesn't even understand blueprints. Xiao Qingduan is a Communist Youth League member who started elementary school at the age of six or seven, and went through junior high school, high school, and university, only graduating from the Mechanical Engineering Department of Tianjin University last fall and participating in practical work. He has no practical work experience at all. Of course, there are many other differences between the two, such as in personality. One is a taciturn person who never easily expresses his opinions at work. If he does express an opinion, it is difficult for others to find a reason to overturn it. He cares for everyone like an older brother cares for a younger brother, but it is difficult to see it on the surface. The other, like many young people, is straightforward and frank. As long as he sees something he is not satisfied with, he easily gets excited, and he never keeps a word in his stomach. As many people say, "He is a straight shooter." With so many differences between the two, it is no wonder that people do not believe that they can become friends. However, the fact is the fact. Many people at the construction site see that the relationship between the two is getting closer day by day. They are together at work, together during study, and together during lunch breaks.

As time went on, people slowly learned how these two became friends.

No matter how many differences there are between the two, they have one thing in common, that is, they both want to work hard to improve themselves and better complete the country's construction tasks. In April of this year, the leadership decided that Ding Chengzhi's fitter team and technician Xiao Qingduan would be responsible for installing the No. 2 turbine blower for the No. 7 blast furnace. Before starting work, Ding Chengzhi secretly thought that he must unite with the technician, use all his strength to complete the installation of the No. 2 turbine blower, and learn well from the work. Xiao Qingduan also thought at this time that he had just come out of school and was undertaking such an important task, and because he had no practical work experience, he would definitely encounter many difficulties. If he did not work conscientiously, and could not integrate with the workers and learn practical work experience from them, the work would be even more difficult. With these ideas, it is of course easy for the two to come together.

This was still when cleaning the pre-installation of the No. 2 turbine blower. Xiao Qingduan stayed with the fitters all day long. He thought that although he couldn't hold tools and work with the workers, he could always learn from the workers, and tell the workers the structural principle of the turbine blower during the pre-installation. When pre-installing the pressure reducing valve on the turbine, he asked the workers: "What is the function of the pressure reducing valve?" The workers were all stumped. He took this opportunity to explain the pressure reducing valve in detail. He said: "The oil delivered from the oil pipe is at a pressure of six kilograms. It is to be supplied to the adjustment table, air release servo motor, speed regulator, main steam valve, bearing and other parts of the turbine, but the amount of oil used in these places is different. For example, what if a pressure of 3.5 kilograms is needed? This is where the pressure reducing valve comes in. The pressure reducing valve is used to adjust the oil pressure according to the amount of oil needed by each part." Xiao Qingduan's approach made Ding Chengzhi very satisfied. He said behind his back: "This young man is really good, we should learn from him. Although he can't get involved in some work yet, it doesn't matter, he'll get there slowly."

Speaking of Ding Chengzhi, he really has some skills. Even the Soviet expert Comrade Shabashov praised him. When installing the two bearings on the turbine blower, the two bearings must be installed on one line, and the accuracy requirement is no more than four "daos" (a hair has eight "daos"). This complex and accurate work depends on finding the center. It takes others four or five days to do this work, but Lao Ding only needs two or three days to solve the problem. There was another time when Ding Chengzhi was busy with other work, and the workers and Xiao Qingduan were installing the piston on the air release servo motor. They screwed on the screws according to the screw holes on the piston sleeve. The piston should move up and down, but after they installed it, the piston became dead. No matter how they moved the piston, it wouldn't move. Xiao Qingduan thought that it might be a new machine, and it was stuck tightly when it was newly installed, so he used a piece of wood to hit the piston. After hitting it for a while, the piston still didn't move. Just then, Ding Chengzhi came over and said, "Why are you hitting the piston with wood? It's easy to break it." They told Lao Ding about the process of installing the piston. "You didn't find the center, did you? There shouldn't be any other problems with this kind of machine. Take it apart and reinstall it." Lao Ding said, and together with them, he took the piston apart and installed it himself. This way, the piston moved up and down very flexibly. Lao Ding explained to them: "This mainly depends on the work of finding the center. If you don't find the center correctly, you can't solve the problem even if the screw holes are aligned, especially with these new-style gadgets. If there is a difference of one 'dao', there will be a problem."

Xiao Qingduan greatly admired Lao Ding's installation work skills. He secretly thought: "When will I be able to learn these practical installation experiences?" And he was also thinking that he must talk to Lao Ding once and ask for the opinion of this old worker.

One day at noon, Xiao Qingduan saw Lao Ding wiping the oil off his hands, preparing to go to lunch, so he took the opportunity to catch up and walked out of the construction site with Lao Ding.

"Comrade Lao Ding, I want to talk to you. I hope you can give me some opinions on my work during this period," he said to Lao Ding as he walked.

"I am very satisfied with your work, because you can still get along with the workers, and you are also very enthusiastic in helping us with technical theory learning."

"It's not about opinions on that. I'm talking about my shortcomings in work. I hope you will not hesitate to point them out to me at any time."

Lao Ding was very pleased to see that Xiao Qingduan could actively seek the opinions of others. Unconsciously, he put one arm around Xiao Qingduan's shoulder and said as he walked: "You should make people feel that you are not a technician. You can live with the workers now, but you can't work with the workers. You talk more and do less. Of course, you have difficulties in practical work. For example, the installation of these machines is mainly done by fitters, but you don't know what tools fitters have and how to use them. But don't worry about this problem. As long as you are willing to accept our help, we will find a way to teach you. If you have any opinions on me, I hope you will not hesitate to bring them up." After a pause, he said again: "I have been a fitter for sixteen or seventeen years, and these sixteen or seventeen years have been spent in a muddle-headed way. Although I have installed many machines, I don't understand anything about the machines, especially the new types of machines we are installing now. I have never even heard of them before, and I can't even read the blueprints. I really hope you can help me learn these new things."

"I have no opinion on you. I wanted to talk to you soon after I came here. I hope you can treat me as your little apprentice. But I also hope that you can take the lead in learning technical theory and set an example for everyone. In learning, I will definitely try my best to help you."

"Okay, it's a deal. Let's help each other to learn!" Both of them were very satisfied and shook hands tightly.

Just then, the leaders of the furnace construction company called on technicians and workers to sign mutual teaching and learning contracts. In this way, on the one hand, a group of worker-technicians can be trained, and on the other hand, the work of technicians can be combined with practical work, so that they can become all-rounders. When Lao Ding heard this news, he went to find Xiao Qingduan. He said to Xiao Qingduan: "Do you know about signing contracts?" "I know. I was just about to talk to you about this." Lao Ding said: "I want to sign a mutual teaching and learning contract with you. What do you think?" Xiao Qingduan said: "That's of course good. Let's discuss the conditions."

The conditions put forward by Lao Ding: Be responsible for teaching Xiao Qingduan all the fitter skills, such as using scrapers, hand hammers, hand files, etc., and teach Xiao Qingduan his fitter experience of more than ten years, so that he can reach the technical level of a formal fitter within half a year. At first, Xiao Qingduan was afraid that he would not be able to do it, because a fitter had to be an apprentice for two years. Lao Ding told him to rest assured that if he studied hard and added his own technical knowledge, there would be no problem in becoming a formal fitter.

Xiao Qingduan is responsible for teaching Lao Ding mathematics (including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, algebra, trigonometry, etc.), mechanical common sense, the structural principle of the turbine blower, steel heat treatment, oil system adjustment, thermodynamics and the operation method of the turbine blower, etc. These are all put forward according to the standard of a technician. Xiao Qingduan said to Lao Ding: "As long as you are willing to study hard, you will definitely be able to learn it. I will definitely try to help you learn it."

The two also stipulated a system: there are four study times per week, and it is not allowed to be absent without reason. Those who come first in study must wait for those who come later for twenty minutes. If they do not come after twenty minutes, they will no longer wait. There is also a stipulated examination system, and it is proposed that those who teach are responsible for teaching well, and those who learn are responsible for learning well. Anyone who violates these regulations will be severely criticized. After the mutual teaching and learning contract was sorted out by Xiao Qingduan, the two signed their names on the contract and handed it over to the leadership.

Just as the two had anticipated, many difficulties were encountered in the study, but these difficulties did not hinder their study. No matter who encountered difficulties, they encouraged each other and tried to help each other overcome the difficulties in learning. When Xiao Qingduan started to learn to use a hand hammer, he saw that Lao Ding was very easy to use a hand hammer, and thought that learning this only required strength, but the first time he hit his hand and it hurt a lot. Therefore, he felt that it was not easy to learn to use a hand hammer, and he began to feel a little discouraged. After Lao Ding learned about this situation, he said to him: "The hand hammer is to a fitter like chopsticks are to us for eating. Because many places in the installation of machines cannot be separated from the fitter's hand hammer, you cannot be discouraged, you cannot be afraid of hardship, you must persevere in learning." After this conversation, Xiao Qingduan continued to learn to use a hand hammer, but he did not swing the hand hammer as high as he did at the beginning, because he was afraid of hitting his hand again, so he swung the hand hammer very low. He thought that he would learn this method first and then swing it up to hit. He did not know that he would not be able to learn to use a hand hammer with this lazy method.

Once, during the lunch break, Lao Ding said to him: "Come on, take the hand hammer and try out your learning results." He also told him: "Don't panic, do it one by one." Xiao Qingduan took the hand hammer nervously and started hitting. He originally wanted to swing the hand hammer open, but he didn't know why he couldn't swing it up.

"No, the way you use the hand hammer makes people know at a glance that you are not a fitter. You can't do anything with this kind of hitting method. You haven't swung the hand hammer open, and your stance is not right. I think you are afraid of being hit by the hand hammer." After Lao Ding finished speaking, he took the hand hammer and made a gesture and hit it twice. "Stand like this, swing the hand hammer up, don't look at the hand hammer with your eyes, just grasp the distance that the hand hammer swings up and where it falls. Even if you don't look, you won't hit your hand. And the stance has a great relationship with using the hand hammer." He also specially looked at his stance and asked Xiao Qingduan to pay attention.

Although Lao Ding told him many tips on using a hand hammer, there was still a difficult look on his face. Lao Ding comforted him and said: "Don't be afraid of difficulties. As long as you work hard, it is easy to break through these difficulties. When you master this technology, and then think about the current situation, you will feel very ridiculous, because these difficulties are really not worth mentioning."

After this examination, Xiao Qingduan made up his mind. He thought that since he had started learning, he had to learn it. He was a member of the Communist Youth League. What would others say if he couldn't persevere? He thought of a way to prevent hitting his hand. He put a section of rubber band on his hand, so that even if the hammer head hit his hand, it wouldn't hurt much. He used this method, and as long as he had time, he practiced, and finally he mastered the technology of using a hand hammer.

Lao Ding was not easier in learning than Xiao Qingduan. His education level was very low. Therefore, it was very difficult to learn the technical knowledge that a technician has mastered.

When he started learning arithmetic, because he first learned addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, although sometimes he had to calculate a problem five or six times to get it right, Lao Ding still persevered in learning. But when he started learning fractions and algebra, it was even more difficult. Sometimes Xiao Qingduan would talk for a long time and he wouldn't understand a word. He thought: "Why does a technician have to learn these headache-inducing numbers?" Just then, Xiao Qingduan asked him to take an exam. A total of four questions were given: fractional multiplication and division, fractional ratios, and a complex fraction. Lao Ding calculated for a long time and only got two questions right before handing in the paper. He said to Xiao Qingduan: "This thing is really difficult to learn. I really don't want to learn it anymore. Let's learn technical theory." Xiao Qingduan said: "You are wrong. Mathematics is like a person's brain to a technician. It can give you ideas. For example, a large rotary disk with a diameter of two hundred millimeters on a windmill is lost. You don't know that its diameter is two hundred millimeters. Now, please make one according to the original diameter..."

"I will make one according to the size of the diameter of the large rotary disk specified on the windmill's blueprint." Lao Ding answered, interrupting Xiao Qingduan.

"What if the blueprint is also gone, and you only know the number of revolutions per minute of the large rotary disk? Then what do you do?"

"Then what can I do?"

Xiao Qingduan said: "You have no way, right? But mathematics can give you an idea. You can find the answer according to the diameter of the small rotary disk, the number of revolutions per minute, and the number of revolutions per minute of the large rotary disk. For example, the diameter of the small rotary disk is one hundred millimeters, and it rotates five hundred revolutions per minute. The large rotary disk rotates two hundred and fifty revolutions per minute. Then you only need to multiply the diameter and number of revolutions of the small rotary disk, and then divide it by the number of revolutions per minute of the large rotary disk. The number that comes out is the diameter of the large rotary disk. Isn't it possible to make the large rotary disk this way? If you don't understand mathematics, this problem is difficult to solve. Do you think it is still necessary to study mathematics?" After a pause, Xiao Qingduan said again: "As for the difficulties, yes, it is indeed very difficult. I don't want to say more about the difficulties. I hope you will think carefully about what you have said to me in the past." After this conversation, Lao Ding thought to himself: "Yes, I can't do what I said myself! I must not be intimidated by difficulties!"

Just as Lao Ding said, he was not intimidated by difficulties. Although the work was very tense and the learning was very difficult, he persevered in learning. Even during the lunch break, he did not stop learning and insisted on understanding the lessons he learned that day. Xiao Qingduan was deeply moved by his spirit of hard study and actively tried to explain the courses in a simple and easy-to-understand way, and helped him study whenever he had time.

Once, the two were working on the installation of the regulating valve on the turbine. Xiao Qingduan asked him: "Lao Ding, tell me about the function of the regulating valve?" "It is used to adjust the speed of the bearing." "Why is the regulating valve pointed and not bald?" Lao Ding couldn't answer. Xiao Qingduan then explained: "The pointedness of the valve makes the air flow smoothly. If there is no point, the air flow will not be smooth, which will affect the operation of the machine." Lao Ding still didn't understand this principle and asked Xiao to explain it again. Xiao Qingduan asked him: "Have you seen the stones in the river? When water touches a pointed stone, the water flow is very smooth. If the water flow encounters a stone without a point, it will create waves. The principle of the regulating valve is the same." After this popular explanation, Lao Ding understood the function of the regulating valve more deeply.

With the progress of the project and the progress of learning, the friendship between the two has deepened. They are very strict with each other and have had fierce arguments when their views on problems are inconsistent. But after the argument, the person who is wrong can take the initiative to find the other party to admit their mistake. Once, Lao Ding worked until night and was too tired, so he went back to the dormitory to rest without asking for leave. Xiao Qingduan waited for him for more than twenty minutes but did not wait. The next morning, Xiao Qingduan found Lao Ding and said: "Are you not planning to study anymore? If you don't study, let's take back the contract." Lao Ding knew that he was wrong and said: "It was my mistake. I shouldn't have gone back without asking for leave. And being tired cannot be a reason for not studying. Who is not the same? From now on, I guarantee that I will never skip class again."

Once again, the two were installing the condenser on the turbine. In order to prevent the condenser from leaking, a layer of mastic oil should be applied to the plane where the condenser and the turbine are in contact. At that time, Xiao Qingduan said: "In order to prevent leakage, more mastic oil should be applied." Lao Ding said: "It is enough to apply a thin layer of oil. Applying more is a waste." Xiao listened and said dissatisfiedly: "Mastic oil is to prevent leakage. Why do you say it doesn't work? Of course, applying more is safer." Lao Ding said:
"You are not wrong to listen to me, I guarantee that there will be no leakage."
"It will be too late to regret if it leaks."

Lao Ding was also angry because Xiao Qingduan was not humble and said: "Okay, you apply it on your side, and I will apply it on my side. Let's say the words to the front, applying more is a waste." The two worked with their heads down. Xiao Qingduan applied a very thick layer according to what he thought, and Lao Ding only applied a thin layer. During the installation, the oil squeezed out from the side where Xiao Qingduan applied, and the remaining layer of oil was about the same as what Lao Ding applied.

After installing the condenser, Xiao Qingduan took the initiative to find Lao Ding for a review. He said: "Lao Ding, judging from today's matter, I am not humble enough..." Lao Ding checked himself before he finished speaking and said: "My temper is not good either. I didn't explain the reason clearly. I must correct this deadly temper."

Two hands full of oil were tightly clasped together, and both of them smiled easily.

In August of this year, Anshan Iron and Steel Company conducted examinations for the workers trained at various construction sites, and those who passed the examination were promoted to technicians. Lao Ding was very nervous after hearing this news. He told Xiao Qingduan about this situation. Xiao Qingduan comforted him and said: "Believe in your own efforts. According to your study results, you will definitely pass the exam." After Xiao Qingduan finished speaking, he shook his hand and congratulated him on his success.

Lao Ding became a technician after the examination. Lao Ding said very emotionally: "Lao Xiao, although I have become a technician, I am still a primary school student of yours." Xiao Qingduan shook Lao Ding's hand and said: "You are also my teacher forever." How were Xiao Qingduan's study results? Lao Ding once made an assessment of his technology and believed that he had learned all the prescribed fitter skills. Whether it was a hand hammer, a hand file, or a scraper, he used them very skillfully and could fully undertake the work of a formal fitter.

    工地上的两朋友
    本报记者　朱波
    开始，谁也不相信钳工组长丁成志和技术员萧庆端会成为朋友，因为谁都知道这俩个人之间不同的地方太多了。就说丁成志吧，他从十几岁就离开贫苦的家庭，到工厂里学习钳工技术，到现在有十六、七年的钳工工作历史。他虽然做钳工有这样长的时间，而且也安装过不少的机器，但对机器的构造却是一门也不通；甚至连图纸都不懂得。萧庆端是一个从六、七岁就入初小读书，经过初中、高中、大学，一直到去年秋季才从天津大学机械系毕业，参加实际工作的青年团员。他一点实际工作经验都没有。当然，俩个人还有很多不相同的地方，譬如在性格上，一个是性情沉默的人，在工作中从不轻易发表意见，他如果提出意见，别人就很难再找出理由来把他的意见推翻。他对任何人都是像老大哥对待小弟弟一样地关心，但是却很难从表面上看出来。另一个像很多青年那样，直爽坦白，只要他看到不满意的事情就很容易激动，肚子里从来就存不住一句话。就像很多人所说的：“是一个直筒子脾气的人。”俩个人之间有这么多的不同之处，难怪人们不相信他俩个人能成为朋友。但是，事实总归是事实，在工地里很多人看到这俩个人的关系，一天比一天密切起来，工作时在一起，学习时在一起，中午休息时也在一起。
    时间长了，人们也就慢慢地知道这俩个人是怎样成为朋友的。
    不管俩个人之间有多少不同的地方，但有一点是相同的，那就是他们俩个都想努力提高自己，更好地完成国家的建设任务。今年四月，领导上决定丁成志钳工小组和技术员萧庆端负责安装七高炉用的二号透平鼓风机。丁成志在未开始工作时就暗暗地想，一定和技术员团结好，把全部力量拿出来，完成二号透平鼓风机的安装工作任务，并从工作中好好学习。萧庆端这时也想，自己刚刚从学校出来不久就担负这样重大的任务，因为没有实际工作经验，一定要遇到很多困难。如果自己不兢兢业业地去工作，不能和工人打成一片，向工人学习实际工作经验，工作就会更加困难。俩个人都有这种思想，当然也就容易结合到一起了。
    这还是在清洗预安装二号透平鼓风机的时候，萧庆端一天到晚和钳工在一起，他想，虽然不能拿着工具和工人一起干活，但总可以向工人学习，而且在预安装中把透平鼓风机的构造原理告诉工人。在预安装透平机上的减压阀时，他问工人：“减压阀起什么作用？”把工人们都问住了。他趁此就详细地把减压阀解释了一番。他说：“从油管输送出来的油是六公斤压力。要供给透平机上的调整台、放风司服马达、速度调整器、主汽门、轴承等机件用，但是，这些地方用油量不同，譬如有需三·五公斤压力的怎么办呢？这就用上减压阀了，减压阀就是根据各个机件需要的油量来调整油的压力用的。”萧庆端这种做法，使丁成志很满意。他在背后说：“这小伙子还真行，应该好好向他学习。虽然有些活他还插不进手去，不要紧，慢慢的就行了。”
    说起丁成志来也真有两手，就连苏联专家沙巴少夫同志也都称赞他。透平鼓风机上的两个轴承，在安装时一定要把两个轴承安装在一条线，而且要求准确到不能差四道（一根头发有八道），这个复杂而又准确的工作决定于找定心。别人干这个活需要四、五天的时间，而老丁只需两、三天就把问题解决了。还有一次，丁成志正忙于别的工作，工人和萧庆端安装放风司服马达上的活塞，他们就按照活塞套上的螺丝眼把螺丝拧上了。活塞应该是上下活动的，但是他们安装好以后活塞却成死的了，不管怎么搬活塞也不活动。萧庆端认为可能是新机器，新安装上卡的紧，于是就用一块木头打活塞，打了一阵也不见活塞活动。正在这时候，丁成志过来了，说：“为什么用木头打活塞，这样很容易打坏的。”他们把安装活塞经过情形告诉老丁，“你们没有找好中心吧？这样的机器不会有别的毛病，拆下来重新安装。”老丁说着就和他们一齐动手把活塞拆下来，亲自把活塞安装上，这样一来，活塞就很灵活地上下移动了。老丁对他们解释说：“这主要决定于找中心的工作，如果找不对中心，螺丝眼对准了也不能解决问题，特别这些新式的玩艺，如果差一道就要出问题。”
    萧庆端非常佩服老丁的安装工作技术，他暗暗地想：什么时候我也能够学到这些实际的安装经验就好了。并且还想着一定要和老丁谈一次，征求一下这个老工人的意见。
    有一天的中午，萧庆端看见老丁正擦着手上的油泥准备去吃午饭，就趁这个机会赶上去，和老丁一齐走出工地。
    “老丁同志，我想和你谈一谈，希望你能对我这一时期的工作提提意见。”他一面走着一面对老丁说。
    “我对你的工作很满意，因为你还能够和工人搞在一起，并且又很热心地帮助我们进行技术理论学习。”
    “不是关于这方面的意见，我是说我在工作中的缺点，希望你不客气地随时给我提出来。”
    老丁看到萧庆端能主动地征求别人的意见，感到很满意，不知不觉地就用一只手抱住萧庆端的肩膀，随走随说：“你应该做到使人感觉不出你是一个技术员来，你现在可以和工人生活在一起了，但是你还不能和工人在一起干活，说的多做的少，当然在实际工作上你是有困难的，譬如说安装这些机器主要是钳工，可是你还不知道钳工有那些工具和怎样使用工具。但是你也不要为这个问题耽心，只要你愿意接受我们的帮助，我们会想办法教会你。你对我有什么意见，也希望你不客气提出来。”停了停他又说：“我这个人做了十六、七年的钳工工作，这十六、七年都是糊糊涂涂过来的，虽然安装过不少的机器，但对机器都一点不懂，特别咱们现在安装的新型机器，过去连听说都没有听说过，连图纸都不会看，我很希望你能帮助我学习这些新东西。”
    “我对你没有什么意见，来这里不久我就想和你谈，希望你能把我当成你的小徒弟。但是我也希望你能在学习技术理论上起带头作用，给大家做个样子，在学习中，我一定想尽办法帮助你。”
    “好吧，咱们一言为定，互相帮助进行学习！”俩个人都非常满意，紧紧地握了握手。
    正在这时候，筑炉公司领导上号召技术员和工人订立互教互学的合同。这样一方面可以培养出一批工人技术员，一方面可以使技术员的工作和实际工作结合起来，成为文武双全的人。老丁听说这个消息，就找萧庆端去了。他对萧庆端说：“你知道订合同的事吗？”“我知道，我正想要找你商量这个事情。”老丁说：“我想和你订个互教互学的合同，你的意见怎样？”萧庆端说：“那当然好啦，咱们就研究一下条件吧。”
    老丁提出的条件：负责教会萧庆端全部钳工技术，如使用刮刀、手锤、手锉等，并且把自己十几年的钳工经验教给萧庆端，使他在半年内达到一个正式钳工的技术水平。开始，萧庆端还怕自己做不到，因为一个钳工要当二年的学徒。老丁告诉他要他放心，如果自己用心学，再加上自己的技术知识，学成一个正式钳工是不会有什么问题的。
    萧庆端负责教给老丁数学（包括加、减、乘、除、分数、代数、三角等）、机械常识、透平鼓风机的构造原理、钢铁热处理、油系统调整、热力学和透平鼓风机的操作方法等。这些都是根据一个技术员标准提出来的。萧庆端对老丁说：“只要你肯努力学习，一定可以学会的，我一定想办法帮助你学会。”
    俩个人还规定了制度：每星期有四次学习的时间，不准无故不到，在学习时先来的要等后到的二十分钟，二十分钟后再不来就不再等。还规定了考试制度，并提出教的负责教好，学的负责学好，谁要违反这些规定就要受到严格的批评。互教互学的合同由萧庆端整理好后，俩个人在合同上签上名字，就把它交到领导上去了。
    正像俩个人预先估计到的，学习中遇到很多困难，但是这些困难却没有阻碍了他们的学习。不管是谁遇到困难，就互相鼓励，互相想办法帮助克服学习中的困难。萧庆端开始学习手锤时，看着老丁打手锤很容易，心想学这个只要有力气就行，但是第一次他就打着手，并且打的很疼。因此就感到学会手锤很不容易，开始有些灰心。老丁知道这个情况后，就对他说：“手锤对钳工来说就像我们吃饭用筷子一样，因为在安装机器时很多地方离不了钳工的手锤，不能灰心，不能怕吃苦，一定要坚持学下去。”经过这次谈话后，萧庆端继续学打手锤，但是不像开始那样把手锤抡得高高的，因为他怕再打手，就把手锤抡得很低，他想先用这个方法学会了再抡起来打。他不知道用这种偷懒的办法是学不会打手锤的。
    有一次，在中午休息时，老丁对他说：“来吧，把手锤拿来试一试你的学习成绩如何。”还嘱咐他说：“不要发慌，一下一下的来。”萧庆端很紧张地拿着手锤，就打起来了。他本来想着要把手锤抡开，但是，不知为什么却抡不起来。
      “不行，你这样使手锤叫人一看就知道你不是钳工。这样打法什么活也干不成。你没有把手锤抡开，站的姿势也不对，我看你是被手锤打怕了。”老丁说完就接过手锤来作了一个架式，打了两下。“要这样的站好，把手锤抡起来，两只眼睛不要看手锤，只要掌握住手锤抡起来的距离和落的地方，就是不看也不会打着手。而且站的姿势对使用手锤有很大的关系。”他还特别看了看自己的姿势要萧庆端注意。
    虽然老丁把很多使用手锤的窍门告诉他，他的脸上仍有难色，老丁就安慰他说：“不要怕困难，只要你努力，很容易就突破这些困难，等你掌握了这个技术以后，再想一想现在情形，你会感到很可笑，因为这些困难真不值一提。”
    经过这次考试后，萧庆端下了决心，他想既然开始学习就要学下去，自己是青年团员，如果不能坚持下去，别人会说什么呢？”他想了一个防止打手的办法，他用一截橡皮圈套在手上，这样就是锤头打到手上也不会很疼了。就用这个办法，只要有时间就练习，终于使他掌握了使用手锤的技术。
    老丁在学习中也不比萧庆端轻松，他的文化程度很低，因此，要学习到一个技术员所掌握的技术知识是有很多困难的。
    开始学算术时，因为先学加减乘除，虽然有时一道题要算五、六次才能算对，老丁还硬着头皮学下去了，但是开始学分数和代数时就更困难了，有时萧庆端讲半天他一句都听不懂，他就想：当一个技术员为什么一定要学会这些使人头疼的数字呢？正在这时候，萧庆端找他要进行考试。共出了四道题：有分数乘法和除法、分数的比例和一道繁分数。老丁算了半天只算对了两道就交卷了。他对萧庆端说：“这玩艺真难学，我真不愿意学下去了，还是学技术理论吧。”萧庆端说：“你说的不对，数学对一个技术人员来说就像人的脑子一样，它可以替你出主意。譬如说有一架风车上的二百粍直径的大旋盘丢了，你不知道它的直径是二百粍，现在请你按照原来的直径配制一个……”
      “我就根据风车的图纸上规定大旋盘的直径大小配制一个。”老丁没有等萧庆端说完就接着回答说。
    “如果图纸也没有了，只知道大旋盘每分钟旋转的数目，那么你怎么办呢？”
      “那样还能有什么办法呢？”
    萧庆端说：“你没有办法了吧，但是数学可以替你想出办法，你可以根据小旋盘的直径、每分钟旋转的数目和大旋盘的每分钟旋转数目找出答案来。例如小旋盘直径是一百粍，每分钟转五百转，大旋盘每分钟转二百五十转，这样你只要把小旋盘直径和转数乘起来，然后再用大旋盘每分钟转数一除，得出来的数字就是大旋盘直径的数字，这样不是就可以配制大旋盘了吗？如果不懂数学，这个问题就不好解决了，你看是不是还有必要学习数学呢？”停了停，萧庆端又说：“至于说到困难，是呀，的确是很困难，关于困难我不想多说什么，我希望你把过去对我说过的话好好地想想就行了。”从这次谈话后，老丁心里想：“是啊，自己说出来的话自己倒不能做到！我绝不能被困难吓倒！”
    正像老丁说的他没有被困难吓倒，工作虽然很紧张，学习虽然很困难，他坚持进行学习，就是中午休息时间，他也没有停止过学习，坚持当天学到功课当天弄通。萧庆端深深地为他这种苦学的精神感动了，主动地想办法把课程讲的通俗易懂，一有时间就帮助他学习。
    有一次俩个人正进行透平机上调整气门的安装工作，萧庆端问他：“老丁，你讲一讲调整气门的作用？”“这是调整轴承的速度用的。”“为什么调整气门是尖的而不是秃的呢？”老丁回答不出来。萧庆端接着就解释说：“气门有尖是使气流流的顺当，如果没有尖，气流就不会顺当，这样就会影响机器的运转。”老丁还是不明白这个道理，又要求萧再讲一遍，萧庆端问他说：“你看见过河里的石头吗？水碰到有尖的石头水流就很平稳，如果水流遇到没有尖的石头就起浪花，这和调整气门的道理是一样的。”经过他这样通俗的解释，使老丁更深刻地明白了调整气门的作用。
    随着工程的进展和学习的进步，俩个人的友情更加深厚了。他们互相要求都非常严格，对问题看法不一致时也发生过很激烈的争论，但是争论以后，错了的人就能主动地找对方去承认错误。有一次老丁工作到夜晚，实在太累了，没有请假就回宿舍休息了，萧庆端等他有二十多分钟的时间也没等着，第二天早晨萧庆端找到老丁，说：“你是不是不打算学习了，如果不学习，咱们就把合同要回来吧。”老丁知道自己不对了，就说：“是我错了，我不应该不请假就回去，而且疲倦不能算作不学习的理由，谁还不是一样，从今以后，我保证再不旷课。”
    又有一次，俩个人安装透平机上的复水器。为了防止复水器漏水，要在复水器和透平机接触的平面上抹一层马斯齐克油。当时萧庆端说：“为了防止漏水，应该多抹一些马斯齐克油。”老丁说：“抹薄薄的一层油就行，抹多了白浪费。”萧听了后就不服气地说：“马斯齐克油就是防止漏水的，为什么说不管用呢？当然是抹多了更保险一些。”老丁说：
  “你听我的话没有错，我保证不能漏水。”
      “如果漏水后悔也晚了。”
    老丁也因为萧庆端不虚心生气了，就说：“好吧，你抹你那一边，我抹我这边，咱们把话说到头里，抹多了白浪费。”俩个人低着头工作。萧庆端就按自己想的抹的很厚，老丁只抹了薄薄的一层。在安装时，萧庆端抹的那边，油都挤出来了，剩下的一层油和老丁抹的差不多。
    安装复水器后，萧庆端就主动地找老丁进行检讨。他说：“老丁，从今天这件事情来看，我是不够虚心……。”老丁没有等他说完就检查自己说：“我的脾气也不好，没有把道理讲清楚，我一定纠正这个害死人的脾气。”
    两只满带油泥的手紧紧地握在一起了，俩个人都轻松地笑了。
    今年八月，鞍山钢铁公司对各工地培养的工人进行考试，考试合格的就提升为技术员。丁成志听到这个消息后非常紧张。他把这种情况告诉了萧庆端，萧庆端安慰他说：“相信你自己的努力，按照你学习的成绩来说，你一定可以考上的。”萧庆端说完还握了握他的手，祝贺他成功。
    老丁经过考试后成了技术员了，老丁非常感动地说：“老萧，我虽然成了技术员，但是我仍然是你的一个小学生。”萧庆端握着老丁的手说：“你也永远是我的老师。”萧庆端学习成绩如何呢？老丁曾对他的技术作了一次鉴定，认为他把规定的钳工技术都学会了，不管是手锤、手锉和刮刀，他使用的都很熟练，完全可以担负一个正式钳工的工作。
