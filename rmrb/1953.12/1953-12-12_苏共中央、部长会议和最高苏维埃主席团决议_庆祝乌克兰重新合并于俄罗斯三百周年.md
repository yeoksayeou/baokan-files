    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 9th: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Council of Ministers of the USSR, and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, have passed a resolution on widely celebrating the 300th anniversary of the reunification of Ukraine with Russia (January 1954).

    The resolution first describes the history of the reunification of Ukraine with Russia. The resolution points out that the Ukrainian people are identical to the Russian people in origin, blood ties, and overall historical development. However, Ukraine was subjected to oppression and aggression by foreign enslavers for a long time. From 1648 to 1654, the Ukrainian people, under the leadership of the outstanding statesman and military leader Bohdan Khmelnytsky, waged a heroic struggle for the liberation of Ukraine from Polish aristocratic oppression and for the reunification of Ukraine with Russia. With the aid and support of Polish peasants and the Russian people, they finally won victory. On January 18, 1654, the Assembly of Representatives of the Ukrainian Cossacks passed a resolution on reunifying Ukraine with Russia. After the reunification, the Ukrainian people saved and preserved their nation. Although Russia was ruled by the Tsar and landlords at that time, the merger had great progressive significance for the future political, economic, and cultural development of the two peoples. The resolution then points out that the people of all nationalities in Russia, under the leadership of the Communist Party, carried out the great October Socialist Revolution, got rid of the shackles of capitalist enslavement, and illuminated the road to socialism for all nationalities. The Ukrainian people were the first to follow the Russian people on the road to socialism. Since then, the alliance and friendship between the Russian and Ukrainian peoples has been increasingly consolidated and strengthened. Now, all the fraternal nationalities of the Soviet Union are confidently marching towards communism side by side. The unbreakable and eternal friendship between the Ukrainian and Russian peoples, as well as the peoples of all nationalities in the Soviet Union, is the guarantee of national independence and freedom, cultural development, and prosperity of the Ukrainian people and other nationalities of the Soviet Union.

    The resolution finally instructs party organizations and government agencies at all levels to widely celebrate this national festival, hold festival speeches, reports, and symposiums, and further consolidate the friendship of all nationalities in the Soviet Union.

    苏共中央、部长会议和最高苏维埃主席团决议
    庆祝乌克兰重新合并于俄罗斯三百周年
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科九日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会、苏联部长会议和苏联最高苏维埃主席团，通过了关于广泛庆祝乌克兰重新合并于俄罗斯三百周年（一九五四年一月）的决议。
    决议首先叙述了乌克兰重新合并于俄罗斯的历史。决议指出：乌克兰人民在起源、血缘和整个历史发展上和俄罗斯人民是相同的。但是，乌克兰长期受到外国奴役者的压迫和侵略。一六四八年到一六五四年，乌克兰人民在杰出的政治家和军事领袖波·赫米尔尼茨基的领导下，为乌克兰从波兰贵族压迫下解放、为乌克兰重新合并于俄罗斯进行了英雄的斗争。他们在波兰农民和俄罗斯人民的援助和支持下终于获得了胜利。一六五四年一月十八日，乌克兰哥萨克人代表大会通过了关于把乌克兰重新合并于俄罗斯的决议。重新合并以后，乌克兰人民挽救了并保存了自己的民族。虽然那时候俄罗斯是由沙皇和地主统治的，但合并对两族人民未来的政治、经济和文化发展都具有巨大的进步意义。决议接着指出：俄国各族人民在共产党领导下进行了伟大的十月社会主义革命，摆脱了资本主义奴役的枷锁，并为各族人民照亮了走向社会主义的道路。乌克兰人民第一个跟着俄罗斯人民走上社会主义的道路。从此以后，俄罗斯人民和乌克兰人民的联盟和友谊日益巩固和加强了。现在，苏联各兄弟民族正满怀信心地并肩走向共产主义。乌克兰和俄罗斯人民，以及苏联各族人民的牢不可破的永恒友谊，是乌克兰人民和苏联其他各族人民的民族独立和自由、文化发展和生活繁荣的保证。
    决议最后指令各地党组织和政府机关广泛庆祝这个全国性的节日，举行节日演讲会、报告会和座谈会，并进一步巩固苏联各族人民的友谊。
