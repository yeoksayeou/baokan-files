    Xinhua News Agency: The Rural Work Department of the Southwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Agriculture, Forestry and Water Conservancy Bureau of the Southwest Administrative Committee convened a symposium on mountainous production in Southwest China from December 8th to 18th to discuss the transformation of agricultural production in mountainous areas. The meeting summarized the achievements in leading mountainous production in recent years, studied the agricultural production conditions in the mountainous areas of Southwest China, and put forward many opinions on how the Party should lead and transform agricultural production in mountainous areas during the transition period.
    In Southwest China, approximately 18 million agricultural residents live in high mountain, impoverished areas. These areas are mostly inhabited or interspersed with minority ethnic groups, with a minority population of about 13 million. Farming methods are quite backward, and they are easily affected by natural disasters. In recent years, the Party committees and people's governments at all levels in Southwest China have strongly supported production in these areas. This year, they have particularly strengthened their leadership over mountainous production and begun planned transformation work. Since the spring plowing this year, in Yunnan, Guizhou, Xikang, Sichuan and other provinces, Party committees and people's governments at all levels have dispatched large numbers of working cadres and agricultural technicians, and have established agricultural technology guidance stations in some areas to guide and transform production. Local people's banks, state-owned trading departments, and supply and marketing cooperatives have also cooperated to support the production of farmers of all ethnic groups in mountainous areas. People's governments at all levels in Yunnan Province have also generally established institutions to lead mountainous production. The problem of the lack of agricultural tools for people of all ethnic groups in mountainous areas has begun to be solved. This year, the Central People's Government allocated 40.8 billion yuan in free agricultural tool funds to support the production of people of all ethnic groups in mountainous areas in Southwest China. As a result, the appearance of agricultural production in mountainous areas of Southwest China has changed greatly this year, and most areas have achieved bumper harvests. In Yunnan Province, in more than 2,300 transformed mountainous villages, the vast majority of villages have increased production by 30% to 150% compared to last year. In Guizhou Province, 150,000 peasant households have received free agricultural tools, and many villages have increased production by one to five times. The symposium believes that to transform mountainous production in the future, the first task is to solve the difficulties of farmers of all ethnic groups in mountainous areas in terms of production materials and means of livelihood. In addition to the people's government continuing to distribute some agricultural tools and agricultural loans, the most important thing is to strengthen economic work, develop state-owned trade and supply and marketing cooperatives, establish and strengthen leadership over primary markets, and develop animal husbandry, handicrafts, and the production of local and special products that are closely related to the lives of local people. Secondly, it is necessary to continue to lead farmers to fight against natural disasters and improve farming techniques. Thirdly, it is necessary to strengthen unified leadership and political work in the transformation of agricultural production in mountainous areas, pay attention to ethnic characteristics, and strengthen ethnic unity.

    西南研究山区农业生产改造工作
    【新华社讯】中共中央西南局农村工作部和西南行政委员会农林水利局，在十二月八日到十八日召开了西南山区生产座谈会，讨论山区农业生产的改造工作。会上总结了几年来领导山区生产的成绩，研究了西南山区农业生产状况，并对过渡时期党如何领导和改造山区农业生产提出了许多意见。
    西南约有一千八百万农业人口在高山贫瘠地区。这些地区多是少数民族聚居或杂居区，少数民族人口约一千三百万，耕作方法相当落后，容易受自然灾害侵袭。几年来，中共西南各级党委和人民政府对这些地区的生产大力进行扶持，今年特别加强对山区生产的领导，开始了有计划的改造工作。今年春耕以来，在云南、贵州、西康、四川等省，各级党委和人民政府派出大批工作干部和农业技术人员，并在部分地区建立农业技术指导站，进行生产的指导和改造工作。各地人民银行、国营贸易部门和供销合作社也配合支持山区各族农民生产。云南省各地人民政府还普遍设立了领导山区生产的机构。山区各族人民缺乏农具的问题已开始解决。中央人民政府今年拨发了四百零八亿无偿农具款，扶助西南山区各族人民生产。因而今年西南山区农业生产面貌大大改变，大都丰收。云南省二千三百多个改造的山区乡，绝大部分乡都较去年增产百分之三十到百分之一百五十。贵州省有十五万户农民得到无偿农具，有许多乡增产一倍到五倍。座谈会认为：今后改造山区生产，首先要解决山区各族农民生产资料和生活资料的困难。除人民政府继续发放一些农具和农贷外，最重要的是加强经济工作，发展国营贸易和供销合作事业，建立和加强领导初级市场，发展和当地人民生活有密切关系的畜牧业、手工业和土产品、特产品的生产。其次要继续领导农民和自然灾害斗争，改进耕作技术。第三要加强对山区农业生产改造工作的统一领导和政治工作，注意民族特点，加强民族团结。
