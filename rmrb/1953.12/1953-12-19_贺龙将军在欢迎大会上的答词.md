Dear comrades:
	The Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, over a period of more than two months, represented the people of the motherland in extending慰问to the broad masses of the Korean people, the Korean People's Army, and the Chinese People's Volunteers, expressing their boundless love and respect for them, and reporting on the Chinese people's unwavering will to continue resisting America and aiding Korea, as well as the great achievements of our national construction. This will have a huge inspiring and promoting effect on their struggle and work, and will further consolidate and develop the profound friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples. We have completed the glorious task entrusted to us by the people of the motherland.
	During our慰问work in Korea, we received a warm welcome wherever we went. Countless moving examples fully demonstrated the deep, fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples, as well as the Chinese People's Volunteers' boundless love for the people of the motherland and the great leader Chairman Mao.
	In Korea, we saw everywhere the Korean people's love for the Chinese people, the close and united fighting friendship between the armies of the two countries, China and Korea, and a high degree of vigilance against the enemy. We saw many steel-like positions with heroic battle records, and the strong support of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Comrades, after more than three years of heroic struggle, the armies of the Chinese and Korean peoples have been tempered into a powerful and invincible force. No matter how brutal and crazy American imperialism is, if it dares to provoke and invade again, it will surely suffer even more惨重defeats in the face of the powerful forces of the Chinese and Korean peoples.
	During our visit, the Korean Workers' Party and the Korean people under the leadership of Marshal Kim Il-sung, and their arduous struggle, left us with a deep impression. The Chinese people are proud to have such a heroic neighbor. The unbreakable fighting friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples forged in blood during the war has been further consolidated and developed in the economic and cultural cooperation agreements signed between the two countries.
	With feelings of reverence, we expressed our heartfelt respect and gratitude to the most beloved people of the motherland—the Chinese People's Volunteers. Under the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese People's Volunteers are战无不胜, 攻无不克, and have achieved brilliant victories. They are worthy of being the most outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese working people, and good soldiers of Chairman Mao. In three years of war, they fought the most savage and brutal American and Rhee Syngman bandit gangs in the world, endured unparalleled hardship and difficulty, overcame all serious obstacles, and achieved great victory. They are heroes tempered in battle, and now they are helping the Korean people restore their economy and rebuild their homes with the same fighting spirit. They are not only safeguarding the security of the motherland with their blood, but also, in the midst of war, are always concerned about the construction of the motherland. Now they are responding to the motherland's call for increased production and conservation, and are extensively carrying out conservation movements to support the construction of the motherland. This is the best example for the people of the whole country, and it is also a great encouragement.
	When we returned to the motherland from Korea, we were entrusted by all the comrades of the Volunteer Army and heroic friends with their only hope: that Chairman Mao would always be in good health and that the construction of the motherland would achieve great success. Volunteer Army comrades are writing everywhere: "May the construction of the motherland advance by leaps and bounds every day, and may our leader live a long and healthy life." Because they deeply know that Chairman Mao's health and the victory of the motherland's construction are the greatest happiness of the people and a huge force for defending peace.
	Dear comrades, let us hail the great victory of the Chinese and Korean peoples, hail the deep friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples, hail the signing of the Sino-Korean economic and cultural cooperation agreements, and hail the immortal feats of the Chinese People's Volunteers. We should redouble our efforts, continue to deepen the movement to resist America and aid Korea, continue to support the Chinese People's Volunteers, strengthen our national defense, actively carry out national construction, and strive to thoroughly realize the general line of the country!
	Long live the unbreakable friendship and unity between the Chinese and Korean peoples!
	Long live the friendly unity of the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union!
	Long live the Chinese People's Volunteers!
	Long live the People's Republic of China!
	Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
	Long live our great leader Chairman Mao!

    贺龙将军在欢迎大会上的答词亲爱的同志们：
    中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团，在两个多月的时间中，代表祖国人民向广大的朝鲜人民、朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军进行了慰问，表达了对他们无限的热爱和敬意，报告了中国人民继续抗美援朝的坚强意志和我国国家建设的伟大成就，对于他们的斗争与工作，将会发生巨大的鼓舞与推动作用，并进一步巩固与发展了中朝人民的深厚友谊。我们完成了祖国人民交给我们的光荣任务。
    在朝鲜的慰问工作中，我们每到一地，都受到了热烈的欢迎。无数动人的事例，充分地说明了中朝两国人民兄弟般的深厚友谊，以及中国人民志愿军对祖国人民和伟大领袖毛主席的无比敬爱。
    我们在朝鲜，到处都看到了朝鲜人民对于中国人民的热爱，看到了中朝两国人民军队亲密团结的战斗友谊，和对敌人的高度警惕，看到了许多有着英勇战绩的钢铁般的阵地，看到了以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营的有力支援。同志们，经过三年多的英勇斗争，朝中两国人民军队已锻炼成为一支强大无敌的力量，不管美帝国主义是如何的残暴与疯狂，如果他胆敢再行挑衅和进犯，在朝中人民强大力量的面前，一定会遭到更为惨重的打击。
    在我们的访问中，朝鲜劳动党和金日成元帅领导下的朝鲜人民和他们艰苦的斗争，给了我们深刻的印象。中国人民以有着这样英雄的邻邦引为光荣。中朝人民在战争中以鲜血凝结成的牢不可破的战斗友谊，在此次两国签订的经济及文化合作协定中，得到了更进一步的巩固和发展。
    我们怀着崇敬的心情，向祖国最可爱的人——中国人民志愿军，表达了衷心的敬意和感谢。在我们伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，中国人民志愿军战无不胜，攻无不克，获得了辉煌的战绩。他们不愧是中国劳动人民最优秀的儿女，毛主席的好战士。他们在三年战争中，和世界上最野蛮、残暴的美李匪帮作战，经受了无比的辛劳和艰苦，战胜了一切严重的困难，取得了伟大的胜利。他们在战斗中是百炼成钢的英雄，现在又同样以战斗精神帮助朝鲜人民恢复经济和重建家园。他们不但以鲜血捍卫着祖国的安全，同时，在战火中时刻关怀着祖国的建设事业，现在他们正在响应祖国增产节约的号召，广泛地开展节约运动，以支援祖国的建设。这对全国人民是一个最好的榜样，同时，也是极大的鼓舞。
    我们从朝鲜回到祖国来，受到志愿军全体同志和英雄友人的一致嘱托，要我们带回他们的唯一希望：愿毛主席身体永远健康和祖国建设获得伟大成就。志愿军同志到处都在写着：“愿祖国建设一日千里，祝领袖健康万寿无疆”。因为他们深切地知道：毛主席的健康和祖国建设的胜利，就是人民最大的幸福，就是保卫和平的巨大力量。
    亲爱的同志们，让我们欢呼中朝人民的伟大胜利，欢呼中朝人民的深厚友谊，欢呼中朝经济及文化合作协定的签订，欢呼中国人民志愿军不朽的功勋。我们应该加倍努力，继续深入抗美援朝运动，继续支援中国人民志愿军，加强国防力量，积极进行国家建设事业，为彻底实现国家的总路线而奋斗！
    中朝两国人民牢不可破的友谊团结万岁！
    以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营友好团结万岁！
    中国人民志愿军万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！
