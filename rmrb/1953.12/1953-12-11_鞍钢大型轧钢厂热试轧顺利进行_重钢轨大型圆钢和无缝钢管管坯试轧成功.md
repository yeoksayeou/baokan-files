Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, December 10th: The newly built large rolling mill at Anshan Iron and Steel Company has successfully rolled three products during its hot test rolling period: large round steel, seamless steel pipe billets, and heavy steel rails. The hot test rolling has been proceeding very well in recent days. From the evening of November 30th to December 7th, the majority of the large round steel and seamless steel pipe billets rolled were first-grade products. The output of trial-rolled products has been increasing day by day. On December 6th, several hundred tons of steel were rolled, and no defective products were found after inspection. The Soviet expert-in-chief advisor inspected the hot test rolling situation in recent days and was very satisfied, believing that the smooth progress of the hot test rolling was a great achievement.

Beginning at noon on December 8th, the large rolling mill trial-rolled another batch of heavy steel rails. The successful trial rolling of heavy steel rails is an important indicator of the smooth progress of the hot test rolling. From now on, large quantities of heavy steel rails rolled by China's first large rolling mill can continuously support the construction of railway transportation throughout the country.

During the hot test rolling period, production personnel have made great progress in their practical operational skills under the specific guidance of Soviet experts. At present, many workers and technicians have initially mastered complex technical tasks such as adjusting the temperature of the heating furnace and operating the mill's pass design.

In order to lay the foundation for formal production, the large rolling mill began one-shift trial production on December 3rd. Production personnel participating in the second-shift trial rolling also began to return to the operating console on the 6th to continue partial production internships. After a few more days of hot test rolling, the large rolling mill will be fully completed and formally put into production.

    鞍钢大型轧钢厂热试轧顺利进行
    重钢轨大型圆钢和无缝钢管管坯试轧成功
    【新华社鞍山十日电】鞍山钢铁公司新建的大型轧钢厂在热试轧期间，已顺利地轧出了大型圆钢、无缝钢管的管坯和重型钢轨等三种产品。连日来，热试轧的情况很好。从十一月三十日晚开始到十二月七日的八天中，轧制出来的大型圆钢和无缝钢管的管坯，大部分都是一级品。试轧产品的产量一天比一天高，十二月六日轧出的数百吨钢材，经过检验没有发现一根废品。苏联专家总顾问检查了连日热试轧的情况，十分满意，他认为热试轧能够这样顺利，是一个很大的成就。
    十二月八日中午开始，大型轧钢厂又试轧出了一批重型钢轨。重钢轨的试轧成功，是热试轧顺利进行的一个重要标志。从此，我国第一座大型轧钢厂轧制的大批重钢轨，就可以源源支援全国各地铁路交通的建设了。
    在热试轧期间，生产人员在苏联专家的具体指导下，实际操作能力都有了很大进步。目前，许多工人和技术人员，已初步掌握了调整加热炉炉温和操纵轧钢机孔型等复杂的技术工作。
    大型轧钢厂为了给正式生产打下基础，从十二月三日就开始了一班制的试轧性生产；参加第二班试轧的生产人员，也在六日开始继续走上操纵台，进行部分的生产实习。再经过几天的热试轧，大型轧钢厂就要全部竣工正式投入生产了。
