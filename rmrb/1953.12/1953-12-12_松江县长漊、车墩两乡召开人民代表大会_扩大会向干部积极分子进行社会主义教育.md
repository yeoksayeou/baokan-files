The People's Congresses of Changlou and Chedun Townships in Songjiang County convened expanded meetings to conduct socialist education for cadres and activists.

Following the expanded county, district, and township cadres' meeting in Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province, Changlou and Chedun Townships convened expanded meetings of the People's Congresses from November 25th to 30th. These meetings systematically and thoroughly publicized and educated attendees on the general line, providing everyone with a profound socialist education and clearly recognizing the country's socialist future and the direction of rural economic development. Participants included members of the township people's governments, people's representatives from all sectors, Youth League branch secretaries, directors of women's federations from various villages, mutual aid team leaders, and grassroots activists.

The expanded meetings of the People's Congresses in Changlou and Chedun Townships first used methods such as listening to reports, group discussions, recollections, comparisons, and detailed accounting to clarify the direction of socialism for everyone, making them aware that they were already transitioning towards socialism step by step. At the meetings, everyone focused on calculating the three accounts of emancipation over the past four years, realizing that the Party and the working class's assistance to the peasants over the past four years was immeasurable. A cadre from Wujiaqiao Village in Changlou Township said: "Listening to Chairman Mao's words is always the truth; following the Communist Party leads to broad roads." After the land reform, agricultural production has increased year after year. In 1949, the average yield of rice per mu in the township was 380 jin; in 1953, it reached 530 jin, an increase of 39.5 percent in four years. In the past, Central Village did not use fertilizer and was often flooded, yielding only about 200 jin per mu. This year, the average yield in Central Village is about 500 jin, more than doubling. Before liberation, the township raised about 700 pigs; this year, the number has increased to 1,800. In the past four years, Wujiaqiao Village has added ten large-scale agricultural implements, such as plows, boats, rice hullers, and waterwheels, providing the villagers with the conditions for intensive cultivation. In 1949, 160 mu of land in the village was unfertilized; by 1952, all cultivated land could be universally fertilized. In 1949, most peasants could only eat porridge, mixed with sweet potatoes, vegetables, and pumpkins. Now, most eat dry rice. For example, in Xuchen Village, out of 140 households, only six ate three meals of dry rice before liberation, and 118 could only eat one meal of dry rice. Now, the vast majority can eat three meals of dry rice, with only seven or eight households eating porridge in the morning and dry rice for lunch and dinner. Wu Xingsheng of Wujiaqiao Village said: "My two children used to beg for food in 1949; now, not only do they eat dry rice, but they also want to be particular about side dishes." Since liberation, Xuchen Village has built fourteen new houses and made nearly six hundred sets of clothes. This year, the Huang Xiuxiang mutual aid team in Wujiaqiao Village purchased four pounds of yarn and ten pairs of galoshes, and also bought 900,000 yuan worth of cloth. After calculating these three accounts, everyone's ideological awareness improved. Some groups further calculated the state's assistance to the peasants. In the past four years, peasants in Changlou Township have received a total of more than 500 million yuan in various agricultural and living loans. This year, the Shen Xueqiao mutual aid team in Central Village borrowed 1.2 million yuan from the bank, and the interest paid to the bank was only 12,500 yuan for four months. If they had borrowed usurious loans for four months, they would have had to pay the "coarse three hu" high interest (calculated in rice, borrowing one shi of rice and returning one shi and five dou), with interest amounting to 625,000 yuan. At the meeting, using Shen Xueqiao's family's purchase of oil, salt, cloth, kerosene, sugar, soap, white tung oil, etc., as examples, it was calculated that the prices of state industrial products were gradually decreasing, bringing many benefits to the peasants. Shen Xueqiao's purchases of these industrial products this year, when totaled, were cheaper than before liberation by one shi, six dou, six sheng, and four ge of rice. If calculated based on the 1,164 households in Changlou Township, it would be cheaper by 1,936 shi, eight dou, nine sheng, and six ge. If calculated based on the entire Songjiang County, the benefits received by the peasants would be more than 158,775 shi of rice, or 33,819,044,000 yuan. With this money, 338 water pumps could be bought; or 33,819 oxen; or 12,061 bolts of cloth. The members of the Chang'an Village mutual aid group connected these benefits to the general line, saying, "This is the result of the growth of socialist economic factors."

Second, by recalling, guide everyone to express the pain given by the small-scale peasant economy, so that everyone understands the backwardness and instability of the small-scale peasant economy, the road of capitalism must not be taken, and inspire the requirements for socialist transformation of agriculture. When the meeting discussed the disadvantages of the small-scale peasant economy, everyone recalled the tragic life before liberation. Before liberation, out of 1,164 households in Changlou Township, 47 households became rich by relying on feudal exploitation, and most peasants lived a painful life of being exploited. He Jinfang, leader of the Shanhua Village mutual aid group, said: "Before liberation, peasants had three economic harms: rent rice, usury, and natural and man-made disasters." Lu Fanggen of Xuchen Village said: "When the small-scale peasant economy encountered natural disasters and illnesses, they had to borrow money, sell land, and work as long-term laborers for others. In the end, they were left with a road of begging for food." Yu Youcai, a middle peasant in Chang'an Village, said: "The small-scale peasant economy is 'three years of wind, four years of rain'; it hinders large-scale production increases, prevents the improvement of peasants' lives, hoping for a better year next year, but next year is still a tattered cotton coat." Gao Zhiqing of Wujiaqiao Village worked hard and saved money to buy three mu of land, thinking that he had made it through. But later, when he married off his daughter and paid for his daughter-in-law's medical treatment, he sold the land that year and collapsed immediately. After liberation, although the peasants in the township "relied on the government to support them" and production increased, some have already sold houses and "eaten usury." For example, Fei Shunyuan and four other households in Zhangjiaqiao Village borrowed 4 million yuan in usury, and they had to return double the amount after five months. Lu Peikun of Xuchen Village improved his life after the land reform, but later his parents died, and he owed a debt of 20 shi of rice. If a small-scale peasant suffers a loss, he will fall into the trap of usury, "poor three dan, rich three dan, can't catch up with life and death," and can't turn over. At the meeting in Chedun Township, the phenomenon of class differentiation in Xinbing Township was also exposed, which shocked many people who were content with the status quo of the small-scale peasant economy. Therefore, everyone also compared the advantages and disadvantages of working individually and being organized. For example, Ren Yulou's family cultivated 21.5 mu of land and had 3.5 laborers, but because they did not participate in the mutual aid group, the rice had not yet been harvested. Wang Shunliang cultivated 23.2 mu of land, and although he only had two laborers, because he participated in the mutual aid group, all the rice had been harvested. The output of the Shen Jinyun agricultural production cooperative in the township was about 15 percent higher than the average yield per mu in the township. The average yield of rice per mu in the Wujiaqiao mutual aid group was 500 jin, while the average yield in the Shen Jinyun agricultural production cooperative in the same village was more than 600 jin. In the discussion, everyone saw that the mutual aid group only had a little bit of socialist seedlings, and it could increase grain production. The seedlings of the cooperative were a little bigger, and it could increase more grain production. In the future, if a large cooperative is run and socialist large-scale production is implemented, it will definitely increase production greatly. Therefore, everyone realized that the old road cannot be taken, and the bright road of socialism must be taken. Zhu Zhenglin of Central Village said: "Only by organizing and developing production can we eradicate the root of poverty. The result of taking the old road is 'one family rich, hundreds of families poor.' This is a dead end and must be resolutely avoided." Many people also criticized the spontaneous capitalist tendencies of the peasants. Wang Zhenglin of Central Village said: "This time the Communist Party pulled me up and took the road of socialism." Wang Xiuxiang, Wei Zhixiang, Gao Zhaolou and other mutual aid group leaders of Wujiaqiao Village all said that they would strive to develop the mutual aid group into an agricultural production cooperative. Chen Yongkang, a national rice bumper harvest model, expressed that he would organize a credit cooperative after selling grain.

Third, guide everyone to recall the pain that profiteers' speculation activities gave to the peasants after liberation, compare the benefits of state-owned companies and supply and marketing cooperatives, and distinguish the boundaries between socialism and capitalism. At the meetings in Changlou and Chedun Townships, the crimes of profiteers disrupting the market and speculating and exploiting after liberation were also exposed. In 1950, when there were no state-owned companies and cooperatives, when peasants in Chedun Township sold rice to grain shops, private merchants initially offered 700 yuan per jin. Later, when more peasants sold rice, the people in the grain shops said, "We don't have any more money, we're not buying any more." But the peasants were waiting for money to use, so the profiteers took the opportunity to lower the price to 650 yuan per jin. For example, at the Tinglin material exchange meeting, when galoshes were out of stock, private merchants immediately raised the price by 10,000 yuan per pair. Another example is that a grain merchant in Shanghai bought grain at a price 510 yuan higher than the listed price and sold it on the black market for 2,400 yuan, making a large profit. The grain merchant in Changlou Township gave sweet potatoes and jellyfish to the peasants on credit, and only wanted grain, not money, when paying the bill. Xu Gongji Firm in Huayang Town gave fertilizer powder to the peasants on credit. The market price was equivalent to four shi of rice per bag, but after three or four months of credit, it became eight shi of rice per bag. A lot of the grain that the peasants had increased production with filled the pockets of the profiteers. After discussion, everyone recognized the true face of the profiteers. Wu Jinzhang of Central Village said: "If you sell grain to a private merchant, he will hoard it and take the opportunity to raise the price, exploiting the people who buy grain to eat; if you sell it to the state, everyone can buy cheap grain."

Finally, using concrete facts to illustrate the relationship between industry and agriculture, as well as workers and peasants, so that everyone understands why the country must first concentrate its efforts on developing heavy industry. Yao Changlong of Shuangmei Village said: "With heavy industry and the establishment of a strong modern national defense force, American imperialism would not dare to touch us." Wang Youlin of Central Village said: "Take drought resistance as an example, with a water pump, water pumping is much easier. If the country has heavy industry, we can use machines to farm." Gu Jinjuan said: "When we use a rice huller, it saves more effort than threshing rice, and one person is worth two people." Gu Ronggen also said: "To use fertilizer powder, we must develop industry." The Shuangmei Village group, in the discussion, all expressed their willingness to help industrial development. Wang Huogen said: "Industrialization depends on workers increasing production. Their contribution to increasing industrial products is much greater than ours." Yao Yuelong added: "Relying on the working class is not wrong. But we peasants must also be responsible. We must produce more grain to sell to the state, so that the workers can eat well and produce." Gu Jinjuan of Central Village said: "Socialist industrialization depends on workers making machines, so we should produce grain well." Chen Yongkang, a national rice bumper harvest model, and Wang Menglai, the head of the agricultural production cooperative, both expressed that they would take the lead in selling grain to the state.

    松江县长漊、车墩两乡召开人民代表大会
    扩大会向干部积极分子进行社会主义教育
    江苏省松江县长漊、车墩两乡，在全县县、区乡干部扩大会议以后，自十一月二十五日至三十日先后召开了人民代表大会扩大会，系统地深入地向到会的人进行了总路线的宣传教育，使大家受到
  一次深刻的社会主义教育，明确认识了国家的社会主义前途和农村经济发展的方向。参加大会的，有乡人民政府委员，各界人民代表，青年团支部书记，各村妇联主任、互助组组长及群众积极分子等。
    长漊、车墩两乡人民代表大会扩大会，首先通过听报告、小组讨论、回忆、对比、算细账等方式，使大家明确认识了社会主义的方向，知道现在已经在一步步向社会主义过渡。会上，大家着重算了四年的三笔翻身账，体会到党和工人阶级四年来对农民的帮助是说不完的。长漊乡吴家桥村干部说：
  “听毛主席话，句句真言；跟共产党走，条条大路”。土地改革以后，农业生产年年上升。一九四九年全乡每亩平均产稻三百八十斤，一九五三年就达到五百三十斤。四年来增产百分之三十九点五。中心村过去不施肥，又常常受水淹，每亩只能收二百多斤。今年中心村的产量平均在五百斤左右，增产一倍以上。解放以前全乡养猪七百头左右，今年已增加到一千八百头。吴家桥村四年以来添制的大型农具，如犁、船、轧稻机、水车等计有十件，使全村人民有了精耕细作的条件；一九四九年全村有一百六十亩田没有下肥料，到了一九五二年，所有耕地都能普遍施肥。一九四九年大部分农民只能吃粥，并用山芋、青菜、番瓜和着吃。现在大部分吃干饭。如徐陈村共一百四十来户，解放以前只有六户吃三顿干饭，有一百十八户只能吃一顿干的。现在，绝大多数都能吃三顿干的，只有七、八户早上吃点粥，中、晚两顿都吃干的。吴家桥村吴兴生说：
  “我的两个小孩在一九四九年还讨过饭，现在不但吃干的，还要讲究吃小菜”。徐陈村在解放后新造了房子十四间，做了近六百套衣服。吴家桥村黄秀祥互助组今年添购了绒线四磅、套鞋十双，还买了九十万元的布。算了三笔账，大家的思想觉悟就都有了提高。有的小组更进一步算了国家对农民的帮助。四年来长漊乡农民得到的各种农业贷款和生活贷款总计有五亿多元。中心村沈雪桥互助组今年向银行贷到一百二十万元，付给银行的利息，四个月只有一万二千五百元。如果借四个月的高利贷，起码要付“糙三斛”的高利（以米计算，借一石米还一石五斗），利息就合到六十二万五千元。会上，又以沈雪桥家购买油、盐、布、火油、糖、肥皂、白桐油等为例，算出国家工业品价格逐步降低，农民得到了很多好处。沈雪桥今年购买的这些工业品，总起来算，比解放前要便宜一石六斗六升四合米。如以长漊乡全乡一千一百六十四户计算，就要便宜一千九百三十六石八斗九升六合。如以松江县全县计算，农民得到的好处有十五万八千七百七十五石多米，或三百三十八亿一千九百零四万四千元。用这些钱去买抽水机，可买三百三十八架；买耕牛，可买三万三千八百十九条；买布，可买一万二千零六百一十匹。长岸村互助小组的组员把这些好处都联系到总路线上来认识，说：“这是社会主义经济因素增长的结果”。
    第二、通过回忆，诱导大家诉小农经济给予的痛苦，使大家都懂得小农经济的落后性和不稳定性，资本主义的道路万万走不得，启发了对农业实行社会主义改造的要求。会议上讨论到小农经济的坏处时，大家回忆起解放以前的惨痛生活。解放以前，长漊乡一千一百六十四家中，有四十七户是依靠封建剥削致富的，大多数农民都过着被剥削的痛苦生活。山黄村互助组长何金发说：“解放以前农民在经济上有三害：租米、高利贷、天灾人祸。”徐陈村陆方根说：“小农经济一碰到天灾病祸，就要借债、卖地、给别人做长工。到后来，还落得一条讨饭的路。”长岸村中农俞友才说：“小农经济是‘三年风、四年雨’；它阻碍大量增产，使农民的生活不能提高，今年望明年好，明年还是一件破棉袄。”吴家桥村的高志青，勤劳生产，省吃俭用，买了三亩田，以为熬出点来了。那知后来嫁女儿，替媳妇医病，当年就把田卖脱，马上就垮下来了。全乡农民在解放以后，虽然“靠政府撑了腰”，生产提高了，但已经有卖房子和“吃高利贷”的。如张家桥村费顺元等四户借高利贷四百万元，五个月后就要加倍归还。徐陈村陆培坤土地改革后生活好转，后来死了爹娘，欠了二十石米的债。小农如果一亏欠，就要跌进高利贷的陷阱，“穷三担、富三担，一生一死追勿着”，不能翻身了。车墩乡的会议上还揭发了新泾乡阶级分化的现象，使许多安于小农经济现状的人大吃一惊。大家因此又比较了单干和组织起来的好坏。如任雨楼家种二十一亩半田，有三个半劳动力，因为没有参加互助组，稻子还没有收好。王顺良种了二十三亩二分地，虽然只两个劳动力，因为参加了互助组，稻子已全部收完了。乡里的沈金云农业生产合作社的产量，比全乡每亩平均产量高出一成半左右。吴家桥互助组每亩平均产稻五百斤，同村的沈金云农业生产合作社，平均在六百斤以上。在讨论中，大家看到了互助组不过有一点点社会主义的苗子，就能增产粮食，合作社的苗子大一点了，就能增产更多的粮食，将来办了大合作社，实行社会主义的大生产，一定能大量增产。所以，大家认识到老路走不得，一定要走社会主义的光明大道。中心村的朱正林说：“只有组织起来，发展生产，才能挖掉穷根子。走老路的结果是‘一家豪富，百家穷’。这是一条死路，坚决走不得。”很多人并批判了农民自发的资本主义倾向。中心村王正林说：“这回共产党把我拉起来，走社会主义的路。”吴家桥村王秀祥、卫志祥、高召楼等互助组长，都说要争取把互助组发展为农业生产合作社。全国水稻丰产模范陈永康表示要在出售粮食后组织信用合作社。
    第三、引导大家回忆解放以后奸商的投机活动给予农民的痛苦，对比国营公司、供销合作社的好处，分清了社会主义和资本主义的界限。长漊、车墩两乡的会上，还揭发了解放以后奸商捣乱市场投机剥削的罪恶。一九五○年，还没有国营公司和合作社，车墩乡农民到粮行里卖稻子的时候，私商开始出七百元一斤，后来卖稻的农民多了，粮行里的人就说：“钞票没有了，不收了。”可是农民等着钱用，奸商就乘机煞价，降到六百五十元一斤。又如亭林物资交流会上，套鞋一脱销，私商立刻就把每双价钱抬高一万元。再如上海的一个粮食商以高出牌价五百一十元的价钱收进粮食，在黑市上以二千四百元的价钱卖出，赚了一大笔钱。粮食商在长漊乡把山芋、海蜇等赊给农民，还账时只要粮食不要钱。华阳镇许公记行赊肥田粉给农民，市价折合四石米一袋，赊出三、四个月就要八石米一袋。不少农民增产得来的粮食，都填了奸商的腰包。经过讨论，大家都认清了奸商的真面目。中心村吴金章说：“把粮食卖给私商，他就要囤积起来，趁机抬价，剥削买粮吃的人；卖给国家，大家都能买到价钱便宜的粮吃。”
    最后，用具体事实说明工业和农业以及工人和农民的关系，使大家懂得了国家为什么必须首先集中力量发展重工业。双梅村姚长龙说：“有了重工业，建立了强大的现代化的国防军，美帝国主义碰也不敢碰我们了。”中心村王友林说：“就拿抗旱来说，有了戽水机，戽水就便当得多了。国家有了重工业，我们就可以用机器种田了。”顾锦娟说：“我们用了轧稻机，就比掼稻省力，而且一人抵得上两人用。”顾荣根也说：“要用肥田粉就要发展工业。”双梅村小组在讨论时，都表示要尽帮助工业发展的责任。王火根说：“工业化，要靠工人增产。他们增产工业品，贡献比我们大得多。”姚岳龙接着补充说：“靠工人阶级是不错的。但是我们农民也要负责任。要多产粮食来卖给国家，让工人吃了好生产。”中心村顾锦娟说：“社会主义工业化，就要靠工人造机器，我们就应该好好生产粮食。”全国水稻丰产模范陈永康、农业生产合作社社长王梦来等都表示要带头把粮食卖给国家。
