Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 22nd – After the U.S. side sabotaged the bilateral talks on the political conference issue, it is increasingly and openly intensifying its conspiracy to undermine the explanatory work and forcibly detain prisoners of war. Hull, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Forces in the Far East, arrived in Korea on the 21st from Tokyo. He openly declared that his main purpose was to discuss how to forcibly detain the North Korean and Chinese prisoners of war now in the Tongchang-ri camp, and how to escort them to the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs to be used as cannon fodder. Hull repeatedly said, "We strictly abide by the Armistice Agreement," but he refused to abide by the provision in the Armistice Agreement regarding the ninety-day explanation period, and refused to abide by the decision of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to extend the explanation period in accordance with the powers conferred by the Armistice Agreement. In reality, he wants to turn the provisions of the Armistice Agreement regarding the issue of prisoners of war into a scrap of paper. He openly declared that he had agreed with Syngman Rhee to劫离[rob away] the North Korean and Chinese prisoners of war from the Tongchang-ri camp at "one minute after midnight on January 22nd." Today, he visited the Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, Thimayya, with the commander of the U.S. Eighth Army, Taylor. After the meeting, he told the Associated Press reporter that he had discussed his so-called "plan to release prisoners of war" with Thimayya. Hull's action is clearly putting pressure on the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, attempting to force the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to violate its repeated decisions to extend the explanation period, and to comply with the U.S.'s destructive policy on the so-called "release" of prisoners of war.

Hull indicated that the U.S. side no longer hopes that the twenty-two American prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated will return home. He stated that his interest lies only in forcibly detaining North Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. In order to shorten the explanation period for the North Korean and Chinese side, Hull is determined to abandon those American prisoners of war who firmly demand that the U.S. side provide a full opportunity for explanation, and use them as sacrifices for the U.S.'s "Cold War" propaganda.

Following Hull, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Radford, and Assistant Secretary of State Robertson, who had held talks with Syngman Rhee before the Korean armistice, are also scheduled to arrive in Korea today. According to U.S. columnist Robert Allen, the purpose of Radford and Robertson's trip is to specifically instruct the U.S. military on how to assist Syngman Rhee's actions to forcibly seize prisoners of war by force.

At the same time, according to the International News Service, a so-called "comfort group" composed of eight Kuomintang agents has gone to Korea, attempting to coerce the Indian Red Cross to distribute so-called comfort items in the prisoner of war camps on behalf of this group of bandit agents. According to a report by the Associated Press, after the Kuomintang bandit gang has robbed this group of Chinese People's Volunteers prisoners of war to Taiwan, they will be forcibly trained and then incorporated into the Kuomintang remnant army.

    美方公开进行强迫扣留战俘的阴谋活动
    赫尔跑到朝鲜企图对中立国遣返委员会行施压力
    【新华社开城二十二日电】美方破坏关于政治会议问题的双方会谈以后，正在日益公开地加紧进行破坏解释工作、强迫扣留战俘的阴谋活动。远东美军总司令赫尔在二十一日由东京抵达朝鲜，他公开宣称他此来主要是讨论如何强迫扣留现在在东场里的朝中被俘人员，以及如何把他们押送给李承晚和蒋介石匪帮充当炮灰的。赫尔口口声声说，“我们严格遵守停战协定”，可是他却拒绝遵守停战协定中关于应有九十天的解释的规定，并且拒绝遵守中立国遣返委员会按照停战协定所赋予的权力而作出的延长解释期限的决定。实际上他要把停战协定中关于战俘问题的规定变为一张废纸。他公然宣称，他已和李承晚商定，将于“一月二十二日半夜后一分钟”将朝中被俘人员劫离东场里营场。他在今天带着美军第八军军长泰勒访问了中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅。他在会谈以后对合众社记者说，他与蒂迈雅商谈关于他的所谓“释放战俘的计划”。赫尔这一行动，显然是在对中立国遣返委员会行施压力，企图强迫中立国遣返委员会违背它所一再作出的关于顺延解释期限的决定，并在所谓“释放”战俘问题上顺从美国的破坏政策。
    赫尔表示，美方已经不希望不直接遣返的二十二名美国战俘遣返回家。他表示他的兴趣只在于强迫扣留朝中被俘人员。赫尔为了要缩短朝中方面的解释期限，决心把那些坚决要求美方给予充分解释机会的美国战俘丢开不管，把他们充作美国“冷战”宣传的牺牲品。
    继赫尔之后，美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福，和曾经在朝鲜停战以前和李承晚举行过会谈的助理国务卿罗伯逊，也定在今天抵达朝鲜。据美国专栏作家罗伯特·艾伦透露，雷德福和罗伯逊此行的目的，是为了具体指示美国军队如何以武力协助李承晚劫夺战俘的行动。
    与此同时，据国际新闻社透露，一个由八名国民党特务组成的所谓“慰问团”已经前往朝鲜，企图胁迫印度红十字会替这批匪帮特务在战俘营中散发所谓慰劳品。另据合众社报道说，国民党匪帮在将这一批中国人民志愿军被俘人员劫往台湾以后，将加以强迫训练，然后把他们编入国民党残余军队。
