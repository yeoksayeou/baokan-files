Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 26th: According to TASS, the Soviet "Labor News" published an article by D. Monin commenting on the international workers' movement in 1953.

Monin wrote: In the history of the international workers' movement, 1953 was a year of intense class struggle in capitalist countries, a year in which millions of workers actively fought for their vital interests and democratic rights, for peace, and for the national independence of all peoples. The unprecedented development of the strike movement in various capitalist countries proves this.

Monin cited examples to illustrate that the massive scale of the strike movement has become an important factor in the current international situation. For example, the Italian strike movement is characterized by unprecedented perseverance, a high degree of organization, and a skillful combination of economic and political demands. In 1950, nearly four million people went on strike in Italy. This year, according to preliminary statistics, more than twenty million workers have participated in the strike movement. The strike movement has intensified further in recent months.

The economic and political struggle of the French working class is growing stronger. Recently, the strike movement in France has seen a powerful upsurge. The strike launched by ground staff at various French airports has entered its second week. Several thousand transportation workers began a strike on December 20th. The French working class is fighting against the forced implementation of policies supporting the "European Army" in France. The fact that the French National Assembly did not ratify the Paris and Bonn war treaties, and that the struggle of the vast number of French patriots for a peaceful resolution of the Indochina issue and other outstanding international issues is intensifying, should all be attributed to the French working class, to its militant Communist Party and General Confederation of Labor.

The struggle of the Japanese working people against sweatshop systems, against the attack of American and Japanese monopoly capital on the living standards of the working class, and against fascist laws and re-militarization has never ceased. In Britain, more than six million trade union members are demanding higher wages.

In the main fortress of the capitalist world, the United States, class struggle is also unfolding on an increasingly large scale. In the history of the American workers' movement, 1953 was a year in which the strike movement reached a new climax.

Monin analyzed the most important characteristics of the 1953 strike movement. These characteristics are: First, its mass character, high degree of organization, the enthusiasm, tenacity and persistence shown by millions of striking workers, and the national offensive launched by the working class in capitalist countries, colonies, and dependent countries. Second, the unity of action of the working class in all walks of life and of all working people, which has grown in the process of class struggle. The desire for solidarity among working people overcame all obstacles, overcame the resistance of splitters among the leaders, and the conspiracies of the ruling groups. Finally, and most importantly, the struggle of the working class for its vital interests and democratic rights is fused with the common struggle of the peoples of all countries against militarization and the arms race, for a peaceful settlement of all international issues, and for peace and national independence.

    苏联“劳动报”载文评论今年国际工人运动
    资本主义国家罢工运动空前发展
   【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十六日讯：苏联“劳动报”刊载了德·莫宁的一篇论文，评论一九五三年的国际工人运动。
    莫宁写道：在国际工人运动史上，一九五三年是资本主义国家发生剧烈的阶级斗争的一年，是千百万工人为争取他们的切身利益和民主权利、争取和平和各国人民民族独立而积极斗争的一年。各资本主义国家罢工运动的空前发展就可证明这一点。
    莫宁举出一些例子，说明罢工运动的巨大规模已经成为目前国际形势中的一个重要因素。例如，意大利罢工运动的特征是空前的坚韧不拔、高度的组织性以及经济和政治要求的巧妙结合。一九五○年意大利的罢工人数将近四百万人。今年，根据初步的统计材料，投入罢工运动的职工有二千多万人。罢工运动在最近几个月中更加强了。
    法国工人阶级的经济和政治斗争的声势正越来越壮大。最近，法国的罢工运动有了强大的高涨。法国各飞机场地勤人员所发动的罢工已进入第二个星期。好几千个交通工人在十二月二十日开始罢工。法国工人阶级正在为反对在法国强迫执行支持“欧洲军”的政策而斗争。法国国民议会没有批准巴黎和波恩战争条约，法国广大爱国者争取和平解决印度支那问题和其他悬而未决的国际问题的斗争日益加强，这一切都应该归功于法国工人阶级，归功于它的战斗的共产党和总工会。
    日本劳动人民反对血汗制度、反对美日垄断资本对工人阶级生活水平的进攻、反对法西斯法律和重新军国主义化的斗争一天也没有停止过。在英国，六百多万工会会员要求提高工资。
    在资本主义世界的主要堡垒——美国，阶级斗争也在以日益广大的规模展开。在美国工人运动史上，一九五三年是罢工运动达到了新的高潮的一年。
    莫宁对一九五三年罢工运动的最重要的特点进行了分析。这些特点是：第一、群众性，高度组织性，千百万罢工工人所表现的热忱、顽强和坚持性，资本主义国家、殖民地和附属国家工人阶级发动的全国性的攻势。第二、在阶级斗争过程中成长的各行各业的工人阶级和全体劳动人民的行动一致。劳动人民团结一致的愿望克服了一切障碍，克服了领导人物中间的分裂分子的抵抗和统治集团的阴谋。最后，也是最重要的是：工人阶级争取它切身利益和民主权利的斗争和各国人民反对军国主义化及扩军竞赛、争取和平解决一切国际问题、争取和平和民族独立的共同斗争融合为一了。
