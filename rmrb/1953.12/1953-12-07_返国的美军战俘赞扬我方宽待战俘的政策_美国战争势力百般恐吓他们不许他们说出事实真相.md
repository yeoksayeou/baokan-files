Xinhua News Agency, December 6th: TASS, New York, December 5th: "National Guardian Weekly" recently published an article from Memphis, Tennessee, titled "What Happened to Our Returning POWs?". The article stated: "One of the most outrageous phenomena of the conspiracy to drag confused Americans into World War III is the intimidation of returning prisoners of war, preventing them from telling the truth. Newspapers, the American Legion, and the FBI collude with each other... . Bening Smith was a corporal in the US Army. When he was captured, he was very scared because he always thought he would be shot or tortured. During the transfer to the POW camp, some POWs' feet were frostbitten because they did not listen to the advice of their escorts and took off their boots when crossing the river. At the first POW camp, they were individually interrogated by a Chinese captain who spoke English, who told them that they would not be treated badly. Bening said that General Dean, in a broadcast speech at the POW camp, thanked the Chinese People's Volunteers for their treatment of the POWs. Bening recounted: 'I have never seen any atrocities committed by the Chinese or North Koreans.' Some Air Force pilots, including O'Neill and Quinn, who the Chinese accused of conducting germ warfare, spoke at various POW camps, calling on the POWs to protest the illegal crimes they themselves had committed. Obviously, the pilots were speaking normally and were not under any influence or pressure. The first day Bening returned to Memphis, a 'Scimitar' reporter interviewed him. He said that there were no atrocities at all, and he was not tortured. These words immediately caused a sensation. At this time, Mueller of the 'Commercial Appeal' came to interview Bening. Mueller, who was resented by the residents of Memphis for writing articles slandering local charitable organizations, said to Bening that his newspaper could make a person famous or ruin them, thus achieving his interview through indirect intimidation. The articles published in the following week, which contained nothing but attempts to portray Bening Smith as a fool deceived by the Communists and a possible traitor, were the result of his interview. Mueller wrote that Bening Smith 'abandoned American ideals'. Because of these articles, Bening received many threatening phone calls and letters. Bening defended himself, saying: 'I didn't think that talking about peace was an un-American act. I think it is un-American to be intimidated for expressing these opinions. Mueller has slandered me as a traitor in these slanderous and brazen articles. What is the meaning of freedom of the press in a country that allows people like Mueller to defame the reputation of innocent citizens? When I came home, I found more war hysteria and war propaganda than I had previously imagined. I think... radio and television are just making war cries; the film industry and all aspects of life that can be observed are mainly reflecting war hysteria. I just came back from a war-torn country, so I have fresh memories of the horrors and dangers of war. When I think of the disasters of the bombing, the crowds of refugees who have lost their loved ones, I shudder to think of what this war would bring to our country, and I love my country so much that I think it is my responsibility to defend it and protect it from all dangers, including the danger of the kind of war I saw in Korea.'"

    返国的美军战俘赞扬我方宽待战俘的政策
    美国战争势力百般恐吓他们不许他们说出事实真相
    【新华社六日讯】塔斯社纽约五日讯：“国民前卫周刊”最近一期刊载了从孟菲斯（田纳西州）寄来的一篇题为“我们回国的战俘怎样了”的文章。文章写道：“那些旨在把迷糊了的美国人拖进第三次世界大战的阴谋的最令人愤慨的现象之一，就是恐吓归来的战俘，不让他们说出真相。报纸、美国退伍军人团和联邦调查局互相串通一气……。贝宁·史密斯是美军中的一个下士。当他被俘时，他很害怕，因为他一直认为，他要被枪毙或是要被拷打。在转移到战俘营去的时候，有些战俘的脚冻坏了，因为他们不听他们的押送兵的劝告，而在过河时把靴子脱掉了。他们在第一战俘营经一个操英语的中国上尉的个别讯问，他向他们说，不会待他们不好的。贝宁说，迪安将军在战俘营的广播演说中感谢中国人民志愿军对待战俘的态度。贝宁叙述说：‘我从来没有看见过中国人或是北朝鲜人有过什么暴行。’有一些空军飞行员，包括中国人控告他们进行细菌战的奥尼尔和奎恩在内，在各个战俘营讲了话，他们号召战俘们抗议他们自己曾做过的这种非法的罪行。显然，飞行员们是神态正常地在讲话，并没有受到任何影响和压力。当贝宁回到孟菲斯的第一天，‘斯吉米达尔根’记者就访问他。他说，根本没有什么暴行，他也没有受到拷打。这些话立即就轰动一时。这时，‘商业呼声报’的缪勒就来访问贝宁。因写污蔑当地慈善机关的一些文章而为孟菲斯居民所愤恨的缪勒向贝宁说，他的报纸可以捧起一个人，也可以使一个人倒霉，这样，他就借间接的威吓而达到了他采访的目的。一周来刊载的那些除了企图把贝宁·史密斯说成是一个受共产党欺骗的傻子和一个可能的卖国贼以外没有其他内容的文章，就是他访问的结果。缪勒写道，贝宁·史密斯‘背弃了美国思想’。由于这些文章，贝宁曾接到了许多恐吓的电话和信件。贝宁为自己辩护说：‘我没有想到，一谈和平，就是非美的行动。我认为，为表达这些意见而自己受到恐吓，这是非美的。缪勒在这些污蔑造谣和厚颜无耻的文章中把我说成是一个卖国贼。在能让缪勒这样一些人来诽谤无辜公民的名誉的国家里，出版自由的意义究竟何在？当我回家之后，我发现了比我以前想像中更凶的战争歇斯底里和战争宣传。我认为……无线电和电视只是在作战争的呐喊；电影事业和可以观察到的生活的各个方面，主要的都是在反映着战争歇斯底里。我是才从遭受战祸的国家回来的，所以我对战争的恐怖和危险记忆犹新。当我想起那些受到轰炸的灾难、失去了亲人的成群的难民时，我悚然地想到，这种战争会给我们的祖国带来什么东西，而我是这样爱我自己的国家，我认为保卫祖国，使它免遭一切危险，包括我在朝鲜所看到的那种战争的危险在内，就是我的责任。’”
