The first "Film Week of the People's Republic of Bulgaria" will be held simultaneously in twenty major cities in our country from December 5th to 11th. Our audiences will further understand the achievements of the People's Republic of Bulgaria in various fields and the lives of the Bulgarian people through these films.

More than forty years ago, a few progressive workers in Bulgaria who made films began preliminary filmmaking experiments under very difficult conditions, using simple techniques and methods. However, Bulgarian capitalists were not interested in domestically produced films, believing that it was more profitable to operate imported foreign films. Imperialists used Bulgaria as a market for dumping their films. Under these circumstances, the Bulgarian film industry could not develop at all. After the victory of the anti-fascist struggle on September 9, 1944, the Bulgarian Communist Party and the great revolutionary leaders of Bulgaria, Dimitrov and his loyal comrade Chervenkov, paid great attention to the development of film art. With the help and guidance of Soviet film art in theory and technology, the film industry has developed rapidly. In recent years, Bulgarian films have not only enriched the cultural life of the Bulgarian people, but have also gradually become a powerful weapon for the Party and the government in the struggle to build socialism.

Bulgarian film products include feature films, newsreels, and scientific educational films. Before the nationalization of the film industry in 1948, feature films were shot by private film companies. The ideological and artistic qualities of these films were very poor. After the Fifth Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party in 1948, there was a change. Comrade Chervenkov's instructions became the guideline for Bulgarian film writers to create film art with national forms and socialist content. Excellent feature films appeared. The first feature film to win the Dimitrov Prize, "Eagle Kalin," was produced under old equipment and backward technology. Subsequently, a series of excellent feature films were produced, including "Alarm Bells," which won the "Struggle for Freedom Award" at the Sixth International Film Festival; "The Dawn of the Motherland," which won the "Special Honorary Award" at the Seventh International Film Festival; and "Danka," which won the "Acting Award." There is also "Under the Yoke," based on the novel of the same name by Bulgarian classical writer Vazov, which reflects the struggle of the Bulgarian people against the Turkish oppressors. "He Who Was Sung" is a film depicting the life of Nikola Vaptsarov, a passionate Bulgarian poet and revolutionary who was shot by fascist executioners on July 23, 1942.

Feature films shot in 1952 and 1953 include: "Our Land," which depicts the struggle against imperialist conspiracies to undermine Bulgaria's socialist construction; "The September Uprising," which depicts the armed uprising of the people under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party in 1923; and "No Need for Boundary Lines," which reflects the struggle of peasants to build socialism in the countryside.

Bulgarian newsreels also have high ideological and educational content. Since the reorganization of the Bulgarian Film Administration Bureau into the Film Industry Committee by Order No. 91 of the Bulgarian Council of Ministers in January 1952, the development of newsreels has entered a new stage. Successful works in documentary films include: "He Is Not Dead," which records the death of Dimitrov, the most beloved mentor of all the Bulgarian people; "The Road is Drawn," which records the Fifth Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party; and also "Five Years of People's Power" and the artistic documentary "Ivan Susanin."

The Bulgarian Newsreel Film Studio planned to produce two large-scale artistic documentaries in 1953, including the life and career of Dimitrov and outstanding Bulgarian musical works, as well as eleven short films, and has successfully shot the first color documentary "May Day, 1953."

Bulgaria has produced excellent scientific educational films such as "People in the Clouds," "The Distant Journey of Cigarettes," and "Village Wedding." By October 1952, Bulgaria had produced more than ninety scientific educational films. Many of these films have high artistic and technical levels and have been warmly welcomed abroad.

Bulgaria's film screening network has developed rapidly since liberation. In 1944, there were a total of 216 cinemas in the country, only 73 of which were in rural areas. By January 1952, it had increased to 805, of which 610 were in rural areas. In addition, there are 128 mobile projection teams showing films to the people in remote areas. With the increase in the film screening network, the number of viewers is also growing rapidly. In 1947, the number of viewers in Bulgaria was more than 16 million, and by 1951 it had reached more than 45 million (Bulgaria's total population is more than 7 million).

Bulgaria currently has seven film studios, including feature film studios, newsreel studios, scientific and educational film studios, animation and puppet film studios, and printing plants for printing copies. Currently, Bulgaria is preparing to build a film city with the most modern equipment and a huge film studio.

Although Bulgaria's film industry is very young, it has achieved brilliant achievements. Now they are constantly striving to improve the quality of their products, infuse the spirit of socialist realism into new films, and constantly absorb the rich experience of Soviet film art.

### 在不断成长和发展中的保加利亚电影事业

    在不断成长和发展中的保加利亚电影事业
    第一次“保加利亚人民共和国电影周”自十二月五日至十一日即将在我国二十个大城市同时举行，我国观众将从这些影片中进一步了解保加利亚人民共和国在各方面的成就以及保加利亚人民的生活。
    四十多年以前，保加利亚国内摄制电影的几位先进工作者，在非常艰难的条件下，使用简单的技术和方法开始了初步的制片试验；但是保加利亚的资本家对国产片不发生兴趣，他们认为经营输入的外国影片更为有利，帝国主义者把保加利亚作为它们影片倾销的市场。在这种情况下，保加利亚电影事业根本不可能得到发展。到一九四四年九月九日，反抗法西斯主义的斗争获得胜利后，保加利亚共产党以及保加利亚伟大的革命领导者季米特洛夫和他的忠实战友契尔文科夫对电影艺术的发展给予极大的关切，又由于得到了苏联电影艺术理论上和技术上的帮助和指导，因此使电影事业得到了迅速的发展。几年来保加利亚的电影不但丰富了保加利亚人民的文化生活，而且已日渐成为党和政府为建设社会主义而斗争的有力武器。
    保加利亚电影产品有故事片、新闻记录片和科学教育片。故事片在一九四八年电影工业国有化以前，是由私营制片公司拍摄的。这些影片的思想性和艺术性都很差。在一九四八年保加利亚共产党第五次代表大会后，有了转变；契尔文科夫同志的指示成为保加利亚的电影作家创作民族形式和社会主义内容的电影艺术的方针。优秀的故事片出现了，荣获季米特洛夫奖金的第一部故事片“雄鹰·卡林”，是在设备陈旧、技术落后的条件下摄制的。接着，一连出了许多优秀的故事片，有获得第六届国际电影节中“争取自由斗争奖”的“警钟”；获得第七届国际电影节“特别荣誉奖”的“祖国的早晨”，和获得“演技奖”的“妲卡”。还有根据保加利亚古典作家瓦佐夫的同名小说编写的“在压迫下”，这是反映保加利亚人民为反抗土耳其压迫者而进行斗争的影片。“被歌颂的人”是描写一九四二年七月二十三日被法西斯刽子手枪杀的保加利亚热情诗人和革命家尼古拉·瓦普察罗夫生平的影片。
  一九五二年和一九五三年拍摄的故事片有：描写与帝国主义阴谋破坏保加利亚社会主义建设而进行斗争的影片“我们的土地”；描写一九二三年在保加利亚共产党领导下的人民武装起义的影片“九月间的起义”和反映农民为在乡村建设社会主义而进行斗争的影片“不需要田界”等。
    保加利亚的新闻记录片也是具有高度思想性和教育内容的。从一九五二年一月保加利亚部长会议以九十一号命令将保加利亚电影管理总局改组为电影事业委员会后，新闻记录影片的发展就走上了一个新阶段。记录影片中成功的作品有：“他没有死”，这是记录保加利亚全体人民最敬爱的导师季米特洛夫的逝世的影片；“路线划定了”，记录了保加利亚共产党第五次代表大会；此外还有“人民政权的五年”和艺术记录片“伊凡·苏萨宁”等。
    保加利亚新闻记录电影制片厂一九五三年计划摄制季米特洛夫的生平事业和保加利亚卓越的音乐作品等两部大型艺术记录片以及十一部短片，并已成功地拍摄了第一部彩色记录片“一九五三年五一节”。
    保加利亚已出产的优秀的科学教育片有：“云彩里的人”、“香烟的遥远路程”和“乡村的婚礼”等。到一九五二年十月止，保加利亚已摄制了九十多部科学教育片。其中很多影片都具有很高的艺术和技术水平，并在国外受到热烈的欢迎。
    保加利亚的电影放映网，解放以后获得迅速的发展。一九四四年全国所有电影院共二百一十六个，其中在乡村的只有七十三个。到一九五二年一月就增加到八百零五个，其中六百一十个在乡村。此外还有一百二十八个流动放映队在边远地区为人民放映电影。随着电影放映网的增加，观众的人数也在迅速地增长着，一九四七年保加利亚全国观众人数是一千六百多万人次，而到一九五一年就达到了四千五百多万人次（保加利亚总人口是七百多万）。
    保加利亚现有七个电影制片厂，包括故事片厂、新闻记录片厂、科学教育片厂、动画片和木偶片厂等，还有印制拷贝的洗印厂。目前保加利亚正着手建立一座拥有最新式的装备和规模巨大的制片厂的电影城。
    保加利亚的电影事业虽然很年青，但是已经获得了辉煌的成就。现在它们正不断努力地提高出品的质量，将社会主义现实主义的创作精神灌入新片中，并不断吸取苏联电影艺术中丰富的经验。
