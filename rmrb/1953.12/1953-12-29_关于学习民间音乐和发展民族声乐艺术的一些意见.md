Some Opinions on Learning Folk Music and Developing National Vocal Music Art

After the People's Daily published Comrade Lü Ji's article "Learning and Inheriting the Excellent Traditions of Folk Music" in August, it aroused the attention of music workers in various places. The Central Conservatory of Music, the Shanghai Branch of the National Musicians Association, the Music and Dance Troupe of the Northeast People's Art Theater, the music working groups of the cultural undertakings administrations of Sichuan and Gansu provinces and Tianjin Municipality, and relevant units in Beijing have all conducted discussions successively. Not long ago, this newspaper invited composers, vocalists, and music theorists Lü Ji, He Luting, Xiang Yu, Ma Ke, Li Yuanqing, Sun Shen, Qu Xixian, Yu Yixuan, Zhou Xiaoyan, Lang Yuxiu, Huang Youkui, Zhang Quan, Sha Mei, Ding Shande, An Bo, Meng Bo, Li Jiefu, Zhang Fei, Shu Mo, Zhang Mei, Xia Bai, Liu Xuechang, Fei Ke, Ying Shangneng, and others, more than thirty people in total, to hold a forum to exchange opinions on the issues of learning folk music and developing national vocal music art.

In the past few years, China's music circles have had many debates on the issue of "Western" voices versus "native" voices in vocal music. After nearly two or three years of practice and research, a relatively unified understanding has been reached. Participants in the forum generally believed that Comrade Lü Ji’s article "Learning and Inheriting the Excellent Traditions of Folk Music" comprehensively and profoundly resolved some of the aforementioned and other issues in vocal music. Regarding whether the vocalization methods of national vocal music and Western vocal music are consistent, everyone felt that the vocalization methods of national vocal music have scientific and unscientific parts, and similarly, Western vocalization methods also have scientific and unscientific parts. Yu Yixuan, director of the Vocal Music Department of the Central Conservatory of Music, said: "The scientific nature of vocalization methods is reflected in the roundness, fullness, purity, elasticity, and ease of control of the voice; at the same time, it can also express the ideological feelings of the songs and be rich in national style." She also pointed out that the singing methods of Henan Opera actress Chang Xiangyu, Inner Mongolian singer Baoyin Delig, and others are scientific. They not only fully express the people's ideological feelings, but also have excellent vocalization. Zhou Xiaoyan, director of the Vocal Music Department of the East China Branch of the Central Conservatory of Music, believes that the scientific nature of vocalization is reflected in conforming to the laws of nature. Vocalist Ying Shangneng also said that vocalization should conform to the scientific principles of physics, psychology, and physiology.

As for whether there is a contradiction between adopting Western vocalization training methods and simultaneously learning national vocal music performance methods, everyone believes that there is no contradiction between the two. Zhou Xiaoyan said: "This is mainly a matter of ideological concerns. Of course, there are some difficulties, but the difficulties can be overcome. In the past, people who studied Western vocalization methods practiced Italian songs from the very first song, and thus were bound by the performance methods of Western songs for a long time, becoming increasingly estranged from their own national things. After ideological transformation, our views on sound are different, and our training methods are also different. As long as we recognize what we should learn from the West, instead of learning everything without selection; and especially study the performance methods of national vocal music from the perspective of ideological feelings, not just formal imitation, then it is not impossible to sing Chinese songs well." Vocalist Zhang Fei also pointed out: Because the excellent traditions of Western vocal art have not been introduced to China, generally only vocalization methods have been introduced, resulting in inconsistencies between learning and application. Unlike the Russian school, which absorbed the useful parts of Western singing methods and combined them with the excellent traditions of national vocal art, it has developed into the excellent vocal art of the Soviet Union today. There are also many valuable experiences in our traditional singing methods, and we must absorb the useful experiences of Western singing methods on the basis of national traditional singing methods to enrich and develop our national vocal art. Composer Liu Xuechang said: "The purpose of singing is to express the content of the song and convey the ideological feelings expressed in the lyrics." He also mentioned that in the past, people who studied vocal music or taught vocal music only focused on the training of sound, such as expanding the range, increasing the volume, and beautifying the tone; they were relatively lax about performance methods. Moreover, they did not pay attention to the fact that performance methods should have their purpose. Vocalist Huang Youkui also agreed that the past vocalization training methods did not fully meet the requirements of the people. She deeply felt that it is impossible to sing a song well if the singer does not understand the ideological feelings of the people today.

Some unscientific aspects of national vocal music are caused by the environment. Composer Shu Mo said that some folk artists, whose voices have deteriorated or have reached puberty, have to continue singing in order to eat and support their families, thus forming some unscientific parts that do not meet physiological conditions; some artists' conservative tendency to "hold back a trick" also hinders them from passing on their valuable and scientific insights to the next generation. Now, we should systematically excavate and study the vocalization methods of national vocal music and organize them into systematic scientific knowledge.

The "blooming of a hundred flowers" in national vocal music art is a matter of great concern to everyone at present. Composer He Luting compared the singing of Chinese opera with Western opera, believing that the excellent traditions of Chinese opera art are worthy of our pride. The singing methods of various roles in Chinese opera are original in expressing the characters' personalities. Shu Mo pointed out that another great feature of national vocal music art is that it is based on each person's different strengths, such as the four students of Mr. Wang Yaoqing in the Peking Opera world, Mei Lanfang, Cheng Yanqiu, Xun Huisheng, and Shang Xiaoyun, each having different styles. Therefore, there is no doubt about the principle of "blooming of a hundred flowers" in vocal art. Composer Ding Shande believes that it is necessary to adopt Western vocalization training methods while learning national vocal music performance methods. Zhang Fei criticized a narrow and stereotypical concept in some people in the past, who regarded national style as a fixed form; believing that only a certain singing method is national, this view is harmful. Composer Li Jiefu felt that vocalists must love the language of the motherland. The opera artists of the past were very fond of their national language, so they performed beautifully and movingly. He also mentioned that the development of vocal art is inseparable from the creation of composers.

Finally, Lü Ji, chairman of the Chinese Musicians Association, spoke: "The reason for the disputes in vocal music in the past was that folk vocalists, those trained in Western vocal music, and vocal music workers in cultural troupes did not understand each other. After these years of practice, they have gradually approached each other, gained some understanding, and some misunderstandings have been easily eliminated. In vocal art, not to mention the Russian school, even the Italian school has popular elements. Today, the Soviet vocal music school has made great progress, and we should learn from the Soviet experience, study Western classical vocal art and their vocal techniques from a realistic perspective on the basis of the excellent traditions of national vocal music. Emphasizing national style in vocal music is necessary. The principle of 'blooming of a hundred flowers' is not only about the coexistence of Chinese and Western, but also about the fact that there can be different styles in national singing methods, because each vocalist develops on their own basis. Learning from folk music should not be formal imitation. The issue of 'Western' voices and 'native' voices existed in the past. Some people say that singing is not a matter of 'Western' or 'native' but a matter of singing well or badly, which is not comprehensive. If we only talk about good or bad, we will ignore the issue of national style. Our vocal art not only belongs to ourselves, but is also part of the world's vocal art; we must constantly promote national vocal art in order to enrich the world's vocal art."

### 关于学习民间音乐和发展民族声乐艺术的一些意见

    关于学习民间音乐和发展民族声乐艺术的一些意见
    本报八月间发表了吕骥同志的“学习和继承民间音乐的优秀传统”一文后，引起各地音乐工作者的注意。中央音乐学院，全国音乐工作者协会上海分会，东北人民艺术剧院音乐舞蹈团，四川、甘肃等省和天津市人民政府文化事业管理局音乐工作组以及北京的有关单位等，均先后进行了讨论。不久以前本报邀请作曲家、声乐家、音乐理论家吕骥、贺绿汀、向隅、马可、李元庆、孙慎、瞿希贤、喻宜萱、周小燕、郎毓秀、黄友葵、张权、沙梅、丁善德、安波、孟波、李劫夫、张非、舒模、章枚、夏白、刘雪厂、费克、应尚能等三十余人举行了座谈会。就学习民间音乐和发展民族声乐艺术问题交换了意见。
    这几年来，我国音乐界在声乐方面，曾在“洋”嗓子和“土”嗓子的问题上有过许多争论，经过近二、三年的实践和研究，已得到了比较一致的认识。座谈会参加者都认为吕骥同志在“学习和继承民间音乐的优秀传统”一文中，比较全面和深刻地解决了包括上述的以及其他声乐中的一些问题。关于民族声乐发声方法和西洋发声方法是否一致的问题，大家觉得民族声乐的发声方法有科学的、也有不科学的部分，同样地，西洋发声方法也有科学的和不科学的部分。中央音乐学院声乐系主任喻宜萱说：“发声方法的科学性表现在声音的圆润、饱满、纯粹、有弹力和操纵自如；同时还能够表达出歌曲的思想感情，并富有民族风格。”她还指出，像豫剧演员常香玉、内蒙古歌手宝音得力格等的唱法就是科学的。她们不但能充分地表现人民的思想感情，发声也是很好的。中央音乐学院华东分院声乐系主任周小燕认为发声的科学性表现在合乎自然的规律。声乐家应尚能也说，发声要合乎物理、心理、生理三方面的科学原理。
    至于采取西洋发声方法的训练，和同时学习民族声乐表现方法之间有否矛盾的问题，大家都认为两者之间并没有矛盾。周小燕说：“这主要还是思想顾虑的问题。当然，其中也不是没有困难，只是困难是能够克服的。过去学西洋发声方法的人，从他练习的第一首歌起就是意大利文的，因而长期地受了西洋歌曲表现方法的束缚，反而和自己民族的东西越来越隔阂了。经过了思想改造，我们对声音的看法不同了，训练方法也不同了。只要我们认识了应该向西洋学习的是什么，而不是毫无选择地什么都学；同时，特别是从思想感情上来研究民族声乐的表现方法，不仅仅是形式上的模仿，那么，唱好中国歌曲并不是不可能的。”声乐家张非也指出：由于没有把西洋声乐艺术中的优秀传统介绍到中国来，一般人只介绍了发声法，以致学和用不一致。不像俄罗斯学派吸收了西洋唱法的有用部分和民族声乐艺术的优秀传统相结合了，才发展成为苏联今日这样的优秀声乐艺术。我国的传统唱法中也有着不少宝贵的经验，我们必须在民族传统唱法的基础上吸取西洋唱法的有用经验，来充实和发展我们民族的声乐艺术。作曲家刘雪厂说：“歌唱的目的是为了表现歌曲的内容，传达歌词所要表现的思想感情。”他还谈起过去学声乐的人或是教声乐的人，仅仅着重在声音的训练方面，如音域的扩大、音量的增强和音质的美；对于表现方法是比较放松的。更没有注意到表现方法应有它的目的性。声乐家黄友葵也同意过去的发声训练方法不全合人民要求。她深切地感到，歌唱者不体会今天人民的思想感情，是不可能唱好一首歌的。
    民族声乐中有些不科学的地方是由环境所造成的。作曲家舒模说，有些民间艺人倒了嗓，或是到了变声期，为了吃饭养家，还不得不唱，而形成不合生理条件的某些不科学部分；有的艺人的“留一手”的保守倾向，也阻碍了他们将自己宝贵的、科学的心得传授给下一代，现在，我们应该有计划地发掘和研究民族声乐的发声方法，整理成系统的科学知识。
    民族声乐艺术的“百花齐放”是目前大家很关心的问题。作曲家贺绿汀将中国戏曲与西洋歌剧的演唱作了比较，认为中国戏曲艺术的优秀传统是值得我们骄傲的。中国戏曲中各种角色的唱法，在表现人物性格上是具有独创性的。舒模指出民族声乐艺术还有一个很大的特点，是根据每个人不同的特长来发挥的，如京剧界王瑶卿先生的四个学生梅兰芳、程砚秋、荀慧生、尚小云就各有不同的风格。因此，声乐艺术中的“百花齐放”原则是没有什么可以怀疑的。作曲家丁善德认为需要采取西洋发声方法的训练，同时又学习民族声乐的表现方法。张非批评了过去某些人中一种狭隘的定型观念，他们把民族风格看做一种固定的形式；以为只有某一种唱法才是民族的，这种看法是有害的。作曲家李劫夫感到声乐家必须热爱祖国的语言。过去的戏曲艺人是非常热爱自己民族的语言的，因此他们表现得很美而动人。他还谈到声乐艺术的发展和作曲家的创作是分不开的。
    最后，中国音乐家协会主席吕骥发言：“过去声乐问题上引起争论的原因，是因为民间声乐家、受过西洋声乐训练的和文工团的声乐工作者三方面互不了解。经过这几年的实践，已经逐渐接近，互相有所了解，某些误解就容易消除了，声乐艺术中，俄罗斯学派不用说，就是意大利学派也具有人民性的部分。今天，苏联声乐学派已有了很大的发展，我们应该学习苏联的经验，在民族声乐优秀传统的基础上，以现实主义的观点来研究西洋古典声乐艺术和他们的声乐技术。在声乐上强调民族风格是必要的。‘百花齐放’的原则不仅仅是指中西并存，而且在民族的唱法中也可以各有不同，因为每个声乐家都是在自己的基础上发展起来的。学习民间也不应该是形式上的模拟。‘洋’嗓子和‘土’嗓子的问题过去是存在的。有人说唱歌不是‘洋’‘土’问题而是唱得好坏的问题，这样说是不全面的。如果只讲好坏，就会忽略了民族风格问题。我们的声乐艺术不仅属于我们自己，也是世界声乐艺术的一部分；我们要不断地发扬民族声乐艺术，才能丰富世界的声乐艺术。”
