    General Line Propaganda Changes the Face of a Backward Village
    Masses in Bajiamen Township Enthusiastically Sell Grain and Request the Establishment of Producers' Cooperatives
    Bajiamen Township in Anyi County, Shanxi Province, is a remote village in the Jiwang Mountains. Due to inconvenient transportation, county and district cadres rarely came here to work in the past. Various tasks in the township were consistently sluggish, always bearing the label of a backward village. After vigorously promoting the general line of the state during the transition period, Bajiamen Township has changed. The work in the township has taken a step forward, the socialist consciousness of the peasants has been raised, and they are actively selling surplus grain to the state. From November 22nd, in less than five days, the township sold 115,300 jin of wheat and 10,200 jin of autumn grain to the state, exceeding the original procurement plan. The good news of the transformation of Bajiamen Township is being spread among the peasants in neighboring villages and the cadres who have worked here.
    On November 23rd, Bajiamen Township convened an enlarged meeting of cadres and activists to repeatedly and thoroughly promote the general line and general task of the state during the transition period, combined with the introduction of the superiority of Cao Yun Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in the county and the happy life of the Soviet people. This greatly encouraged the cadres and activists. Li Juquan, the township production director who originally wanted to be replaced, said, "After listening to the report on the general line, my thoughts of being replaced have been cleared. I am determined to continue and take the socialist road!"
    After the meeting of cadres and activists, everyone divided the work and went to the masses to promote the general line, taking into account the actual situation of the township. For example, the fact that the two sprayers and five new plows purchased by the township increased grain production made the peasants realize the benefits of socialist industrialization and inspired their enthusiasm to support industrialization. Sun Xin, a peasant who turned over after liberation, had large granaries piled high and small granaries full, and also raised three head of livestock. He excitedly said, "If it weren't for the leadership of the Communist Party, I wouldn't have such good times today. The state is purchasing surplus grain, and I want to sell the 22 shi of wheat I have to the state to support national construction and strive to live a happy life like the Soviet peasants as soon as possible." He also mobilized six households, including Sun Dengke, to sell 18,000 jin of wheat to the state. At this time, everyone regarded selling surplus grain to the state as a glorious thing. Lei Xue had previously mobilized his family to sell 800 jin of wheat. Now, seeing that the village had put up a list of honor for those who sold a lot of grain, he mobilized his family to sell another 1,000 jin of wheat.
    The general line propaganda in Bajiamen Township not only overfulfilled the grain purchase plan but also greatly promoted various tasks. The peasants understood that taking the socialist road required them to work hard to produce more grain. Many people asked to join mutual aid teams and improve their production. Old man Lü Xuankui repeatedly asked Lü Yingkui to join his mutual aid team. Lü Yingkui and Lü Chongkao's two mutual aid teams requested the higher authorities to approve the establishment of agricultural producers' cooperatives. The original three permanent mutual aid teams have been further consolidated, the seven temporary mutual aid teams will also become permanent, and the newly organized seven mutual aid teams are also working with great enthusiasm. In terms of production, 923 mu of land in the township have been autumn-plowed, and 200 mu have been plowed twice. The peasants are using the money they earned from selling grain to purchase fertilizers and farm tools, preparing to further improve production next year, produce more grain, support national construction, and strive to transition to socialist society as soon as possible.

    总路线宣传改变了落后乡面貌
    八将门乡群众踊跃卖粮要求办生产合作社
    山西省安邑县八将门乡是稷王山中的一个偏僻乡村。因为交通不便，过去县、区干部不常到这里工作，乡里各项工作一贯疲疲沓沓，总是戴着个落后乡的帽子。这次大张旗鼓地宣传了国家过渡时期总路线以后，八将门乡变样了，乡里工作前进了一步，农民们提高了社会主义觉悟，积极地把余粮卖给国家。从十一月二十二日起，不到五天工夫，这个乡就卖给国家十一万五千三百斤小麦，一万零二百斤秋粮，超过了原来的收购计划。八将门乡面貌改变的好消息，正在邻近乡村的农民和在这里工作过的干部中间互相传告着。
    八将门乡在十一月二十三日召开了干部和积极分子扩大会议，反复地、详细地宣传了国家在过渡时期的总路线和总任务，结合介绍了该县曹允农业生产合作社的优越性和苏联人民的幸福生活。这一来，干部和积极分子大大地振奋起来了。原来想换班的乡生产主任李居宽说：“这次听了总路线的报告，我的换班思想打通了。我决心干下去，走社会主义道路！”
    干部、积极分子会议开过后，大家分了工，联系该乡实际情况去给群众宣传总路线。如以该乡买来的两架喷雾器、五张新犁使粮食产量增加等事实，使农民认识到社会主义工业化的好处，启发了农民支援工业化的积极性。农民孙辛未解放后翻了身，打的粮食大囤堆小囤满，还喂着三头牲口。他兴奋地说：“不是共产党的领导，那有我今天的好时光。国家收购余粮，我要把现存的二十二石麦子卖给国家，支援国家建设，争取早日过苏联农民那样的幸福生活。”他还动员孙登科等六户农民卖给国家一万八千斤小麦。这时候，大家都把卖余粮给国家看作是光荣的事情。雷雪先前次动员家里卖了八百斤小麦，现在看到村里给卖粮多的人挂了光荣榜，又动员家里卖了一千斤小麦。
    八将门乡的总路线宣传，不仅使购粮计划超额完成，而且对各项工作起了很大的推动作用。农民们懂得了走社会主义道路要努力生产更多粮食，许多人都要求参加互助组，要求提高自己的生产。吕宣奎老汉再三找吕应魁，要求参加他的互助组。吕应魁、吕崇考两个互助组要求上级批准办农业生产合作社。原有的三个常年互助组更加巩固了，七个临时性的互助组也要进行常年互助，新组织的七个互助组也搞得劲头很高。在生产方面，全乡九百二十三亩地进行了秋耕，并有二百亩耕到二遍。农民们正在用卖粮得到的款子购买肥料和农具，准备明年进一步搞好生产，多打粮食，支援国家建设，争取早日过渡到社会主义社会。
