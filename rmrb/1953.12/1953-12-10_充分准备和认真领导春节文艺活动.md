　　Today, this newspaper publishes the instruction from the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government on carrying out rural Spring Festival literary and artistic activities to promote the general line to farmers. This instruction should be taken seriously by local cultural authorities, literary and artistic organizations, and other relevant organizations.
　　Intensively promoting the general line for the state's transition period to the people of the whole country, especially to the farmers, is the most important and regular task in current cultural and artistic work. Utilizing the 1954 Spring Festival, in coordination with the nationwide mass literary and artistic activities widely carried out in rural areas, using various art forms such as movies, dramas, songs and dances, folk art, lantern slides, and pictures, mobilizing all the forces of local cultural centers, cultural stations, rural amateur theater troupes, and folk artists to conduct a concentrated and vivid education on the general line of the transition period to farmers across the country, is of great significance at present to enhance farmers' patriotism and socialist consciousness.
　　The key to carrying out Spring Festival literary and artistic propaganda lies in fully mobilizing professional and amateur artistic creation forces to actively participate in the propaganda of the general line, while also providing a batch of suitable artistic propaganda materials from top to bottom in a timely manner. In addition to film prints being uniformly supplied by the China Film Distribution Company, local cultural authorities and literary and artistic organizations are currently actively organizing creation and compiling materials, which is very necessary. Organizing creation is a meticulous task, and should strive for diversity in the scope of material selection and forms of expression according to the different life experiences and artistic strengths of each literary and artistic worker. Propaganda methods should also be as flexible as possible. For example, combining appropriate oral propaganda when organizing local opera, song and dance, and acrobatics performances is a practical and feasible method.
　　The organization of Spring Festival propaganda activities includes two important aspects. One aspect is organizing film projection teams, state-owned theater troupes, and song and dance troupes to tour and perform in rural areas and towns, and using cultural centers and cultural stations in various counties and districts to carry out related propaganda activities. The other aspect is to widely mobilize the strength of the masses themselves, such as mobilizing the strength of rural amateur theater troupes and folk artists. This aspect must absolutely not be ignored. These two aspects should be well combined, and the tasks of publicizing the general line and carrying out rural mass literary and artistic activities should be combined. During the Spring Festival work, urban art workers go to the countryside to promote, bringing new ideas and new art to the countryside; at the same time, they help to develop rural mass amateur art activities; they can also take this opportunity to understand the social conditions of the countryside and humbly learn from farmers and folk art. Under the assistance of professional art workers, rural mass art activities can also be consolidated and improved through the encouragement of Spring Festival propaganda.
　　Local cultural authorities should, in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Culture of the Central Government, make all preparations in advance and conscientiously lead this work during the Spring Festival. The propaganda departments of party committees at all levels should actively guide this propaganda movement politically, ideologically, and artistically, so that the Spring Festival literary and artistic propaganda work can be completed victoriously.

### 充分准备和认真领导春节文艺活动

    充分准备和认真领导春节文艺活动
    今天本报刊载了中央人民政府文化部关于开展春节农村文艺活动向农民宣传总路线的指示。这一指示应当引起各地文化主管部门，各地文艺团体和其他有关团体的重视。
    向全国人民特别是向农民深入宣传国家过渡时期的总路线，是当前文化工作和文艺工作中头等重要的也是经常的任务。利用一九五四年春节，配合全国农村广泛开展的群众性的文艺活动，运用电影、戏剧、歌舞、曲艺、幻灯、图画等各种艺术形式，动员各地文化馆、文化站及农村业余剧团、民间艺人的一切力量，向全国农民进行一次关于过渡时期总路线的集中的、生动的教育，借以提高农民的爱国热忱和社会主义的觉悟，在目前尤具有重大的意义。
    开展春节文艺宣传的关键问题，在于充分发动专业的和业余的艺术创作力量积极地参加总路线的宣传，同时自上而下地及时地供应一批合用的艺术宣传资料。除电影片由中国影片发行公司统一供应外，目前各地文化主管部门和文艺团体正在积极地组织创作，编印资料，这是很必要的。组织创作是一件细致的工作，应当按照各个文艺工作者不同的生活经验和艺术特长，在选材的范围和表现的形式上应力求多样。宣传方式也应尽量灵活。例如，在组织戏曲、歌舞、杂技等下乡演出时，配合适当的口头宣传，就是一种切实可行的办法。
    春节宣传活动的组织工作，包括两个重要方面。一方面是组织电影放映队、国营剧团、歌舞团等到各地农村和市镇中巡回演出，以及运用各县、区文化馆、文化站开展有关的宣传活动。另一方面是广泛地发动群众自己的力量，例如发动农村业余剧团和民间艺人的力量。这一方面，也是绝对不可以忽视的。应当把这两个方面很好地结合起来，把宣传总路线和开展农村群众文艺活动的任务结合起来。在春节工作中，城市的艺术工作者下乡宣传，把新的思想、新的艺术带到农村；同时帮助开展农村的群众业余艺术活动；他们也可借此机会了解农村的社会状况，虚心地向农民和民间艺术学习。而农村的群众艺术活动，在专业艺术工作者的协助下，通过春节宣传的鼓舞，也可借此得到巩固和提高。
    各地文化主管部门，应当依照中央文化部的指示，事前做好一切准备工作，并在春节中认真地领导这一工作。各级党委宣传部门，应当从政治上、思想上和艺术上积极指导这一宣传运动，使春节文艺宣传工作能够胜利地完成。
