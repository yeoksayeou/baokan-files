    The Central First Ministry of Machine Building
    Prepares for First Quarter Production Next Year

    In order to meet the new production tasks for next year and ensure the balanced completion and over-fulfillment of the national plan, the Central First Ministry of Machine Building has actively carried out various preparations for production in the first quarter of next year.

    The production of state-owned machine industry is basically steadily increasing. It is estimated that the total output value this year will increase by about 68 percent compared with 1952. However, judging from the production situation in previous years, after a period of intense production in the fourth quarter of each year, various production enterprises and units often experience a relaxation of morale and a decline in production in the first quarter of the following year, which damages the balance of annual production and brings great harm to production. For example, at the end of last year, various production enterprises and units experienced serious rush work. Some units exhausted most of their work-in-progress reserves, which affected production in the first quarter; some had specific tasks, but the drawings, materials, and tools were not prepared; and some were affected by the late determination of tasks, which also affected production preparations. According to statistics, due to insufficient preparations in the first quarter of this year, 248,000 workdays were lost due to shutdowns, while 124,000 workdays were worked overtime. The total output value in January of this year was 22.3 percent lower than in December of last year.

    In order to resolutely prevent the recurrence of the undesirable phenomenon of slackness at the beginning of the year next year, and to ensure the completion and over-fulfillment of the production task of increasing the total output value by 29 percent next year compared with this year, the Central First Ministry of Machine Building began in October this year to systematically and adequately carry out various preparations for production in the first quarter of next year. The production targets for the first quarter of next year were issued to the factories at the end of October. At the beginning of November, instructions on the production work for the first quarter of 1954 were issued to the factories, requiring all production enterprises and units to study and arrange the production work for the first quarter of next year in a timely manner, and to strive for the planned total output value of the first quarter of next year to be no lower than the estimated completed production value of the fourth quarter of this year, and to achieve a monthly balanced completion of tasks. The various professional bureaus and supply and sales departments under the Ministry have made a lot of preparations for the supply, production, and sales issues, technical preparation issues, production collaboration, and how to organize complete sets of supply for the first quarter of next year. The Supply Bureau and the Sales Bureau have held a series of meetings for the production of the first quarter of next year, and have actively inquired about the situation and needs from the various professional bureaus under the Ministry and the relevant departments outside, so as to organize production in a planned manner according to objective needs.

    Currently, the Central First Ministry of Machine Building is working hard to solve the problems of insufficient tasks in some units and the supply of some important materials, as well as production collaboration. Whether the tasks can be supplemented will be the key to ensuring that production in the first quarter of next year is not lower than that in the fourth quarter of this year. At present, further efforts must be made on this issue. The leading bodies have convened professional meetings on the issues of electromechanical coordination, the balance of ball bearing production, and the production cooperation of forged steel to be resolved in the first quarter of next year, and the problems have been initially resolved. The National Mechanical Pre-allocation Conference for organizing balanced production is being held, and efforts are being actively made to solve the supply problems of boiler steel plates, I-beams, and high-quality steel.

    The regional offices and factories of the Central First Ministry of Machine Building are also working hard on the preparations for production in the first quarter of next year. The Northeast Office recently held a production cooperation meeting, which basically solved the problems of production collaboration and fully utilizing mechanical efficiency in the first quarter of next year. The East China Office also convened a meeting of factory directors to check the preparations of the factories for production in the first quarter of next year and discussed the problems in compiling the 1954 plan. The preparations before production of large state-owned electromechanical factories in the Shanghai area have been initially completed. The preparations of the factories in other regions have either ended or are being actively carried out.

    中央第一机械工业部
    进行明年第一季度生产准备工作
    中央第一机械工业部为了迎接明年新的生产任务，保证均衡地完成和超额完成国家计划，积极地进行了明年第一季度生产的各项准备工作。
    国营机械工业的生产，基本上在稳步地上升着，今年预计生产总值约可较一九五二年增加百分之六十八左右。但是，从历年的生产情况来看，各个生产企业单位在每年第四季度紧张生产之后，到次年第一季度，往往出现情绪松懈，生产下降的现象，破坏了全年生产的均衡性，给生产带来很大的危害。如去年年底，各个生产企业单位曾发生严重的突击现象，有的单位把在制品储备量大部耗尽，影响了第一季度的生产；有的有了具体任务，但图纸、材料和工卡具没有准备好；有的因任务定得迟，也影响了生产准备工作。据统计，今年第一季度由于各种准备工作不足，停工达二十四万八千个工作日，同时又加班加点十二万四千个工作日。今年一月份生产总值，比去年十二月份降低了百分之二十二点三。
    为了坚决防止明年再度出现年初松懈的不良现象，保证完成和超额完成明年生产总值比今年增长百分之二十九的生产任务，中央第一机械工业部从今年十月份开始，就有系统地较充分地着手进行了对明年第一季度生产的各项准备工作。明年第一季度的生产指标，在十月底就已下达了各厂，十一月初，又向各厂发出关于一九五四年第一季度生产工作的指示，要求各个生产企业单位及时研究和布置明年第一季度的生产工作，争取明年第一季度的计划生产总值，不低于今年第四季度预定完成的生产总值，并做到能逐月均衡地完成任务。部属各专业局和供、销部门对明年第一季度的供产销问题，技术准备问题，以及生产协作，如何组织成套供应问题等，均作了不少的准备工作。供应局和销售局均为明年第一季度的生产开了一系列的会议，并主动向部属各专业局和外面有关各部门了解情况、了解需要，以便有计划地根据客观需要来组织生产。
    现在，中央第一机械工业部正紧张地着手解决某些单位任务不足和一些重要材料的供应以及生产协作等问题。能否补足任务，将是保证明年第一季度生产不低于今年第四季度生产的关键。目前对这个问题，还必须进一步努力。明年第一季度需要解决的机电配合、滚珠轴承生产的平衡以及锻钢的生产合作问题，领导方面已分别召开了专业会议，问题已获初步解决。组织平衡生产的全国机械预拨会议正在召开，对于锅炉钢板、工字钢和优质钢材等的供应问题，正在积极设法解决。
    中央第一机械工业部各大区办事处和工厂，对明年第一季度生产的准备工作也在紧张进行。东北办事处最近召开了生产合作会议，基本上解决了明年第一季度中生产协作，充分发挥机械效能的问题；华东办事处也曾召集各厂厂长会议，检查了各厂对明年第一季度生产的准备工作情况和讨论了编制一九五四年计划中的问题，上海地区大的国营机电工厂生产前的准备工作已初步就绪，其他地区各厂的准备工作有的已告结束，有的正在积极进行中。
