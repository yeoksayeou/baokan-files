Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd, Tokyo dispatch: Under the instigation of the US and Japanese reactionaries, the Sendai High Court of Japan, disregarding the solemn protests of the broad masses of the Japanese people and world public opinion, brazenly sentenced the majority of innocent defendants in the second trial of the "Matsukawa Incident" to death and long-term imprisonment on fabricated charges.

The Sendai High Court of Japan announced the second trial verdict of the "Matsukawa Incident" at 10:00 AM on the 22nd. Seventeen of the twenty defendants who were sentenced in the first trial were still sentenced to death or heavy sentences. Among them, Suzuki Shin, chairman of the Fukushima Branch of the National Railway Workers' Union, Honda Noboru, executive committee member of the Fukushima Branch of the National Railway Workers' Union, Sugiura Saburo, chairman of the Matsukawa Factory Union of Tokyo Shibaura Electric Company, and Satoichi, central committee member of the Tokyo Shibaura Electric Company Union Federation, were sentenced to death. The other thirteen people were sentenced to life imprisonment and seventeen, fifteen, thirteen, ten, seven, and three and a half years of imprisonment, respectively.

The facts of the US and Japanese reactionaries framing the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" have long been exposed. For several years, people from all walks of life in Japan have been running around and appealing for the release of all innocent victims. Righteous people from all over the world have also protested thousands of times against this crime of the US and Japanese reactionaries framing Japanese patriots, and demanded the early restoration of freedom for all defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident." However, the US and Japanese reactionaries first instructed the Japanese Supreme Court to unreasonably postpone the date of the verdict originally scheduled for November 5, and then ordered the police across the country to implement tight security on the 22nd on the eve of this sentencing, as if facing a formidable enemy, in order to suppress the people's fierce protests and realize their vicious conspiracy. The Sendai High Court's arrogant and unreasonable verdict this time shows that in order to further suppress the people and clear the way for rearming Japan and reviving Japanese militarism, the US and Japanese reactionaries have openly adopted fascist means to trample on the basic democratic rights and freedoms of the Japanese people.

Satoichi, who was sentenced to death, issued a statement on behalf of the defendant group after the sentencing, pointing out that today's verdict tramples on the truth. This is a manifestation of the judges abandoning independence, abandoning conscience, and abandoning humanity under the instructions of the US and Japanese reactionaries. The statement emphasized that all kinds of evidence conclusively prove that all twenty of us are innocent. We firmly believe that no matter what verdict the judges make, there is only one truth. We must resolutely fight to the end.

Xinhua News Agency, December 22nd, Tokyo dispatch: The Japan National Relief Association immediately issued a protest statement after the Sendai High Court of Japan announced the second trial verdict of the "Matsukawa Incident." The statement said: During today's sentencing, Judge Suzuki sentenced four people to death, two to life imprisonment, and a total of more than 100 years of imprisonment to eleven people. Judge Suzuki declared some people innocent and reduced the sentences for some people, attempting to pretend that a fair trial had been conducted. But in reality, this is completely the same as the first trial, and all the arguments of the prosecution authorities have been accepted in this illegal verdict. This sentencing is a verdict in which Judge Suzuki violated the world's public opinion, succumbed to power, and sold out the soul of the Japanese people. We always firmly believe that all defendants are innocent, and we will continue to carry out a stronger movement together with peace-loving and just people all over the world in order to achieve the goal of acquitting and releasing all defendants.

    日本仙台高等裁判所不顾日本和世界各国人民的严正抗议
    悍然判处“松川事件”无辜被告死刑和徒刑
    日本国民救援会发表声明提出严正抗议
      【新华社二十二日讯】东京消息：在美、日反动派的指使下，日本仙台高等裁判所不顾日本广大人民和世界舆论的严正的抗议，在“松川事件”第二审判决中悍然以莫须有的捏造罪名，对绝大部分无辜被告判处死刑和长期徒刑。
    日本仙台高等裁判所已在二十二日上午十时宣布“松川事件”的第二审判决。在第一审中被判刑的二十名被告仍有十七人被判死刑或重刑。其中国营铁道工会福岛分会主席铃木信，国营铁道工会福岛支部执行委员本田升，东京芝浦电气公司松川工厂工会主席杉浦三郎和东京芝浦电气公司工会联合会中央委员佐藤一四人被判死刑；其他十三人分别被判无期徒刑与十七年、十五年、十三年、十年、七年和三年半的徒刑。
    美、日反动派陷害“松川事件”无辜被告的事实，早已经大白于天下。日本极其广泛的各阶层人士，几年来一直为要求释放全体无辜受害的被告而奔走呼吁。世界各国的正直人民也曾千百次地就美、日反动派这一陷害日本爱国者的罪行提出抗议，并要求早日恢复“松川事件”全体被告的自由。但是美、日反动派先是指使日本最高裁判所将原定在十一月五日举行的判决日期无理推延，接着又在这次宣判前夕如临大敌地下令全国的警察在二十二日实行紧张的戒备，以镇压人民的激烈抗议，实现它们的恶毒阴谋。仙台高等裁判所这次蛮横无理的判决表明：美、日反动派为了进一步镇压人民以扫清重新武装日本、复活日本军国主义的道路，已公开采用法西斯手段摧残日本人民的基本民主权利与自由。
    被判处死刑的佐藤一在宣判后代表被告团发表声明指出：今天的判决践踏了真理。这是裁判官在美、日反动派的指使下抛弃独立、抛弃良心和人性的表现。声明强调说：各种证据都确凿地证明我们二十人全都是无辜的。我们坚信，不管裁判官作出何种判决，真理只有一个。我们要坚决斗争到底。
    【新华社二十二日讯】东京消息：日本国民救援会在日本仙台高等裁判所宣布“松川事件”的第二审判决后，立即发表抗议声明。声明说：在今天宣判时，铃木裁判长判决死刑四人、无期徒刑二人，以及对十一人的共计一百多年的有期徒刑。铃木裁判长宣布一部分人无罪，对于一些人实行减刑，企图假装是进行了公正的裁判。但在实际上，这是和第一审完全相同，全部接受了检察当局的论据的非法判决。这次宣判，是铃木裁判长违背了全世界的舆论，屈服于强权，出卖了日本人灵魂的一次判决。我们始终坚信全体被告无罪，我们今后要和全世界爱好和平与正义的人士一道，继续进行更强有力的运动，以达到全体被告无罪获释的目的。
