Houtun Township, Tenth District, Jiaoxian County, Shandong Province, carried out the general line education by summarizing production achievements, enabling Party members and cadres to clearly understand the direction of socialism, the relationship between industrial and agricultural production, and the importance of developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

Before carrying out the general line education, the leadership first understood the ideological situation of Party members and cadres and discovered that some cadres had insufficient understanding of the country's development prospects, felt that "socialism is far away," were satisfied with the current level of life and production, and were not actively participating in and leading mutual aid and cooperation.

In response to the thinking of Party members and cadres, the leadership conducted education on the general line from shallow to deep. First, the production achievements of this year were summarized, and then everyone was guided to find the root causes of farmers' poverty in the old society through recollection and comparison: First, the invasion of imperialism. Everyone recalled the tragic life under the rule of the Japanese devils: livestock were snatched away, things were looted, and in Houtun Village alone, more than forty houses were burned down in 1943. In those days, even life was not guaranteed. Second, the Kuomintang reactionaries' exorbitant taxes squeezed the blood out of the peasants. Before liberation, landlords owned 60 percent of the land in the township. One hundred households in Houtun Village were begging for food. Third, the cruel exploitation by landlords. Fourth, the high price of industrial products and the low value of grain not only prevented farmers from developing production but also made it impossible for them to buy oil and salt. Fifth, unstable prices made farmers suffer from unscrupulous merchants. Before liberation, Chen Shilu sold an ox, and the money he got was only enough to buy a piece of clothing, four catties of pork, and two watermelons. Everyone realized that "unscrupulous merchants are blood-sucking tubes, sucking the blood of farmers." "Unscrupulous merchants are grain-stealing rats, stealing the grain unnoticed."

On the basis of the ideological awareness of cadres and Party members, they were further guided to analyze the reasons for the current development of production and improvement of life. Everyone pointed out that the Communist Party and the People's Government had done many good things for the people after liberation. The government issued loans to farmers and supplied grain, bean cake, fertilizer powder, pesticides, etc., at reasonable prices, enabling farmers to avoid exploitation by unscrupulous merchants and usurers. At the same time, the government also led farmers to practice close planting, drought resistance, pest control, and drainage, improve farming techniques, and help farmers increase production. The recovery and development of industry have created conditions for the recovery and development of agricultural production. In the past three years, the "scissors difference" between industrial and agricultural products has gradually narrowed. For example, wheat was 800 yuan per catty the year before last, 920 yuan per catty last year, and 1,140 yuan per catty this year. However, the prices of industrial products such as cloth, kerosene, matches, fertilizer powder, and arsenic stone (a medicine for killing underground pests) have gradually decreased. For example, Geng Yongxiao sold 810 catties of wheat and 100 catties of beans to the state this year, which was 197,000 yuan more than the year before last. This year, he bought 100 feet of cloth, seven catties of kerosene, sixteen packs of matches, six catties of arsenic stone, and sixty-two catties of fertilizer powder from the cooperative, saving 146,800 yuan compared with the year before last. The money earned from selling more grain and the money saved from buying industrial products totaled 343,800 yuan, which could buy 446 catties of millet, equivalent to the income of two mu of land this year. Calculated at one and a half catties of grain per person per day, his family of three could eat for more than three months. He said, "Once you do the math, it's as plain as a louse on a bald head. To live a good life, there is no way but industrialization." The stability of prices guarantees the actual income of farmers and eliminates the threat of "low grain prices hurting farmers" and "bumper harvests becoming disasters." The government led farmers to organize, which increased production. Everyone realized the benefits of mutual aid and cooperation from concrete examples and unanimously agreed that production in mutual aid teams is better than individual farming, and cooperatives are stronger than mutual aid teams.

After Party members and cadres improved their understanding of the worker-peasant alliance, they further strengthened education on national industrialization. In this way, everyone further realized that the development of national industry in recent years has brought many benefits to the vast number of farmers; to realize socialism, we must rely more on national industrialization. Chen Shishan said, "The more industry develops, the cheaper the fertilizer powder will be. The more fertilizer powder farmers use, the more grain they will produce, and the more powerfully they can support industrial construction." Wang Qingren said, "Without industrialization, how can we use tractors? Our production is still 'the old two dou' (only two dou of grain were produced per mu in the past). Without industrialization, we will be beaten by imperialism." Because they clearly understood the importance of national industrialization, everyone strengthened their confidence in realizing socialism. Jin Benmo said, "In the past, I was half-believing about the prospects of socialism. I didn't know where the happy socialist life would come from. Now I understand that it depends on industrialization." Everyone excitedly expressed: Socialism is emerging, there is hope, let's work hard! Wang Qingren said: "Transitioning to socialism is like crossing a river. Now Chairman Mao is leading us on a ferry. As long as everyone rows together, paddle by paddle forward, we will definitely be able to realize socialism."

With the gradual improvement of understanding of the worker-peasant alliance, Party members and cadres further understood that farmers must take the road of mutual aid and cooperation, and realized that socialism can enable farmers to finally get rid of poverty and become wealthy together. Everyone believed that the old road was a "dead end," and only socialism was the bright road. Then, by examining and criticizing capitalist ideas, the boundaries between socialist and capitalist ideas were further clarified. Individual Party members and cadres who did not actively participate in mutual aid and cooperation, or attempted to hoard grain, or were passive in their work, also made self-criticisms and promised to implement the general line with practical actions in the future. For example, Wang Qingren, who withdrew from the agricultural production cooperative this year, reviewed after receiving education and said: "The Party led me on the boat to transition to socialism, and I wavered before I had gone far. Now I understand that this is the harm of capitalist ideas." He resolutely stated that he would actively participate in leading and running the production cooperative well in the future.

After everyone clearly understood the Party's general line and general task during the transition period, everyone sold their surplus grain to the state. Eleven Party members immediately reported that they would sell 2,630 catties of surplus grain.

Finally, the leadership guided everyone to formulate a winter work plan and determined that at present, while leading the masses to carry out winter plowing, accumulating fertilizer, digging drainage ditches, and consolidating mutual aid and cooperative organizations, they should vigorously promote the Party's general line and general task during the transition period in conjunction with production, and motivate the masses to sell their surplus grain to the state.

    山东省胶县第十区后屯乡进行总路线
    教育后党员和干部的社会主义觉悟普遍提高
    山东省胶县十区后屯乡，通过总结生产成绩，向党员、干部进行总路线教育，使他们明确认识了社会主义的方向和工业生产与农业生产的关系，以及发展互助合作运动的重要性。
    在进行总路线教育以前，领导方面首先了解了党员、干部的思想情况，发现有的干部对国家的发展前途认识不足，觉得“社会主义遥遥无期”，满足于现有的生活、生产水平，不积极参加和领导互助合作。
    领导方面针对党员、干部的思想，由浅入深地进行了总路线的教育。首先总结了今年的生产成绩，然后引导大家通过回忆、对比，找到了在旧社会里农民贫困的根子：一是帝国主义的侵略。大家回想起在日本鬼子统治下的悲惨生活，牲口被抢走，东西被抢光，光是后屯村，在一九四三年就被烧掉四十多间房子。那年头连性命也不保险。二是国民党反动派的苛捐杂税，挤干了农民的血。三是地主的残酷剥削。解放前，全乡有百分之六十的土地是地主的。后屯村有一百户农民要饭吃。四是工业品价贵，粮食不值钱，农民不但没有发展生产的本钱，就连油、盐也买不起。五是物价不稳，农民吃奸商的亏。陈世禄在解放前卖掉一头牛，得来的钱就只够买一件衣服、四斤猪肉、两个西瓜。大家都认识到“奸商就是吸血的管子，吸去了农民的血。”“奸商就是盗粮的老鼠，不知不觉地粮囤就叫他盗空了。”
    在干部、党员的思想有了觉悟的基础上，又进一步引导他们分析了现在生产发展和生活改善的原因。大家都指出，解放后，共产党和人民政府给人民办了许多好事。政府对农民发放了贷款，又以合理的价格供应了粮食、豆饼、肥田粉、农药等，使农民避免了奸商和高利贷的剥削。同时，政府又领导农民实行密植、抗旱、治虫、排水，改进耕作技术，帮助农民增加了生产。工业的恢复和发展使农业生产的恢复和发展有了条件。三年来工、农业产品的“剪刀差”逐渐缩小了。如小麦，前年是八百元一斤，去年是九百二十元一斤，今年是一千一百四十元一斤。可是布匹、火油、火柴、肥田粉、砷石
  （是一种杀地下害虫的药）等工业品的价格却逐渐下降了。如耿永孝今年卖给国家小麦八百一十斤、豆子一百斤，就比前年多卖钱十九万七千元；今年从合作社买了一百尺布、七斤火油、十六包火柴、六斤砷石、六十二斤肥田粉，比前年省了十四万六千八百元。卖粮多收入的钱和买工业品省下来的钱加起来，一共三十四万三千八百元，可买四百四十六斤谷子，等于今年二亩地的收入，如按每人每日吃一斤半粮计算，他家三口人可吃三个多月。他说：“一算账，真是秃头上的虱子明摆着，要过好日子就非工业化不行。”物价的稳定保障了农民的实际收益，解除了“谷贱伤农”、“丰收成灾”的威胁。政府领导农民组织起来，提高了产量。大家从具体事例认识到了互助合作的好处，一致认为：互助组的生产比单干的好，合作社又比互助组强。
    在党员、干部提高了对工农联盟的认识以后，又进一步加强了关于国家工业化的教育。这样，大家进一步认识到：这几年国家工业的发展，使广大农民得到了很多的好处；要实现社会主义，更得靠国家工业化。陈世善说：“工业越发展，肥田粉就越贱，农民用肥田粉越多，打粮就越多，就能更有力地支援工业建设。”王清任说：“要没有工业化，那能使上拖拉机，咱的生产还是‘老二斗’（过去每亩只产二斗粮）。如果没有工业化，要挨帝国主义的打。”由于明确了国家工业化的重要意义，大家就坚定了实现社会主义的信心。金本谟说：“过去对社会主义的前途半信半疑，不知社会主义幸福生活从那里来，现在明白要靠工业化。”大家都兴奋地表示：社会主义露头啦，有盼头了，猛力干吧！王清任说：“过渡到社会主义，就好比过江，现在毛主席领导咱上了渡船，只要大家齐摇橹，一划一划往前赶，就一定能够实现社会主义。”
    随着对工农联盟认识的逐步提高，党员、干部又进一步了解农民必须走互助合作的道路，认识到社会主义才能使农民最后摆脱贫困，大家富裕起来。大家都认为旧道路是“死胡同”，只有社会主义才是光明大道。接着，通过检查、批判资本主义思想，进一步划清了社会主义思想与资本主义思想的界限。不积极参加互助合作的，或企图囤粮的，或工作消极的个别党员干部，也都作了检讨，并保证以后以实际行动贯彻执行总路线。如今年退出农业生产合作社的王清任，受到教育后，检讨说：“党领导我上了过渡到社会主义的船，才走了不远，我就动摇了，现在才明白这是资本主义思想害了我。”他坚决表示：今后要积极参加领导搞好生产合作社。
    在大家明确认识了党在过渡时期的总路线、总任务以后，大家纷纷把余粮卖给国家。有十一个党员当场自报卖余粮二千六百三十斤。
    最后，领导方面引导大家制订了冬季工作计划，并确定目前一面领导群众进行冬耕、积肥、挖排水沟，整理互助合作组织，一面结合生产大张旗鼓地宣传党在过渡时期的总路线、总任务，带动群众把余粮卖给国家。
