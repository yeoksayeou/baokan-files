    “Thinking of Dong Cunrui Blowing Up the Bunker”
    Winter has arrived. In Lao Junmiao, Gansu Province, more than 2,000 kilometers away from Beijing, drilling workers work in the wind and snow, braving the cold. The mud sprayed on their bodies immediately freezes into ice. When work requires it, they have to climb hundreds of meters high on the derrick to perform heavy operations in the biting cold wind. Oil production workers have to take care of two or three wells each. Because the weather is too cold, if the crude oil is not heated within four or five minutes after it comes out of the wellhead, the oil pipeline will freeze. Therefore, they check the pipeline day and night, climbing mountains and treading through snow.
    Once, an oil well experienced a "blowout" due to control failure. Oil shot out of the ground dozens of meters high, and there was a violent roar underground. The situation was already very dangerous. At this time, only by closing the main gate in the deep pit below the wellhead could the "blowout" be stopped. Two workers went down twice and were fainted by natural gas. Youth League member Ma Wanpeng asked the captain for the third time to send him down. So three workers tied him with ropes and pulled him. Ma Wanpeng used all his strength to resist the natural gas and walked down. He almost fainted twice. But he thought: I must not go up, I must persevere! He struggled and finally found the gate. He used his last strength to reach out and close it. Later, when asked what he was thinking at the time, he said: "I was thinking of the property of the motherland, thinking of Dong Cunrui blowing up the bunker!" (Ge Jiali)
    A Responsible and Conscientious Supervisor
    There is a newly dispatched supervisor on the construction site of the second iron-smelting plant of Anshan Iron and Steel - Yang Guiwen. He has thirty years of iron-smelting experience and is nearly sixty years old. Because he has never worked as a supervisor and cannot understand some drawings, coupled with his low level of education, he has some difficulties in his work. But he said: "Since the Party has entrusted me with the task, I must complete it no matter how difficult it is. Because this is the place that the people of the whole country care about most."
    Since he arrived at the construction site, he has been running around the engineering area dozens of times every day. Workers always see him holding a ruler in his hand, measuring here and looking there. In addition to finding ways to improve his work, he also mobilized everyone to ask questions. He took the problems found at the construction site home and asked his son to help him record them. He said to his son: "You write it down in the notebook for me, which is also considered your participation in basic construction." In just over a month at the construction site, his notebook has recorded more than forty rationalization proposals, most of which have been implemented. For example, he suggested repairing the iron pillars of the four-horse machine track to replace the slag-turning pillars, saving the country a lot of financial and human resources. For example, he found that the inside of a large gear (one of the important components of the horse machine, weighing more than one thousand kilograms) was twenty millimeters higher. If it was installed like this, there would be a major rework, otherwise there would be an accident during the test run. He was afraid that his memory was not good because of his age, so he checked it against the drawings again, and proved that it was indeed twenty millimeters higher. At his suggestion, it was re-turned again, avoiding accidents and waste. (Xue Wanren)
    Wei Xianzhu Risks His Life to Put Out a Fire
    On the afternoon of December 14th, in the Puzhen Station Repair Factory, two temporary workers who knew a little bit of technology went to the oxygen cylinder to press the wind gauge. The wind pressure was too high, the wind gauge broke, and the oxygen caught fire. Wei Xianzhu, the welding team leader who was cutting iron plates, ran to the place where the fire was as soon as he saw the critical situation. A warehouse keeper shouted: "Lao Wei, it's very dangerous, you can't go!" Seeing that the oxygen cylinder was about to explode, it was indeed very dangerous. But Wei Xianzhu knew the surrounding environment: within a circle of thirty square meters, there were oil depots, material depots..., and a dozen or twenty worker comrades. So he said: "My life is not important, I must try my best to rescue!" Saying that, he quickly ran over.
    When he was approaching the oxygen cylinder, he crawled on the ground. When he reached it, there was no screw wrench, and the switch could not be tightened. He ran back to get the screw wrench. Time passed second by second, and the danger became greater and greater. When he crawled back again, the people standing in the distance were sweating for him. In a blink of an eye, Wei Xianzhu tightened the switch of the oxygen cylinder, and the fire was extinguished. Someone asked: "Lao Wei, where did you get that strength?" He smiled and said: "We want to build socialism, and protecting national property is the glorious responsibility of our workers." (Cao Zhijian)
    Thirteen Days to Complete a Month's Task
    In the machine shop of the Yunnan Iron Factory, an eye-catching "Individual Winner's Flowing Red Flag" fluttered around with the operating shaper. Working next to this shaper is Youth League member Liu Yunsheng. It was he who completed a month's task in thirteen days.
    In the production increase and economy practice movement, Liu Yunsheng formulated a plan to increase production by 10%. In October, he improved the pin clamp, allowing it to clamp two pins, greatly shortening the auxiliary time. Later, he used two planing tools to plane two products on the shaper, which doubled labor productivity. This month, he overfulfilled the production increase and economy practice plan by 17.8%.
    Liu Yunsheng was not satisfied with these achievements. He racked his brains day and night, always wanting to master the complex characteristics of the products in the machine shop. One day, he remembered a female worker in a Soviet movie who increased her ability to watch looms. He thought: Can our planers also watch more than one shaper? After careful consideration, he focused his main energy on a shaper for planing small products, and also managed a shaper for planing large products, which did not take much effort. As a result, the task for November was completed in thirteen days. (He Rong)
    Not Afraid of High Mountains and Steep Slopes, Delivering Machines to the Construction Site
    In October, the Shanxi Provincial Industrial Bureau requested the Handan Transportation Branch to transport a steam engine from Handan to the Changzhi construction site. This was an urgent and arduous task. Not only did the company not have heavy-duty vehicles and had to use general vehicles for transportation, but it also had to pass through some deep ditches, steep slopes, and rugged mountain roads. Communist Party member Zhao Zhihua bravely accepted this task. The company specially sent three experienced veteran drivers to assist him.
    On the second day after departure, they passed the first difficult pass on the Handan-Changzhi Road - "Shiliang Bridge." Not far from the departure on the third day, they passed "Man Niu Gou" full of large and small stones. Further ahead was a steep mountainside about ten zhang high. The road was very narrow, with a high mountain on one side and a large mountain ditch more than thirty zhang deep on the other. In addition, the machine was tall and the vehicle was very unstable when driving. At this time, Zhao Zhihua thought: If the machine cannot be transported, thousands of workers will not be able to start production, which will affect industrial construction. So he said to everyone: "Comrades! There are no difficulties that the working class cannot overcome. We must complete the task. I will drive!" When the car drove close to the top of the slope, the weight of the machine shifted completely to the rear, and the front wheels had already lifted up. At this time, the people who had been arranged in advance rushed to the front of the car and pressed down the lifted front end. When going downhill, the weight of the machine shifted completely to the front, pressing the two front wheels and the steering wheel so that they could not be turned. He fearlessly used all his strength to turn the wheels and slowly slid down the hillside with the help of the pressure. The other two vehicles also drove past smoothly in this way.
    It was already dark, and there were still more than sixty li of rugged and uneven mountain roads to the construction site. Zhao Zhihua and his comrades, wanting the mines of the motherland to start production as soon as possible, rushed to the construction site overnight without eating. The Shanxi Provincial Industrial Bureau specially presented them with a banner to thank the hard work of the Zhao Zhihua transportation team.

    为祖国工业化而艰苦奋斗的人们
    “想到董存瑞炸碉堡”
    冬季来到了，在远离北京两千多公里的地方——甘肃省老君庙，钻井工人不避严寒在风雪中工作，泥浆喷在他们的身上马上就结成了冰块。工作需要的时候，他们还要冒着刺骨的寒风，爬上百十公尺高的井架上进行繁重的操作。采油工人们一个人要看管两三口井。因为天气太冷，如果原油出井口后四五分钟不通暖气，油管就要冻住，所以他们不分昼夜地爬山踏雪检查着管道。
    有一次，一个油井因为控制失灵发生了“井喷”，油冲出地面有几十公尺高，地下发着猛烈的巨响，情况已经很危险了。这时，只有将井口下面深坑里的总闸门关住，才能制止“井喷”。有两个工人两次下去都被天然气熏昏了，青年团员马万鹏第三次请求队长派他下去。于是三个工人用绳子将他缚住，拉着他，马万鹏用全身的力量顶着天然气向下走，有两次差点被熏倒。但是他想：决不能上去，一定要坚持！他挣扎着，终于找到了闸门，他用最后的力量摸上去把它关住了。后来别人问他当时怎样想的？他说：“想到祖国的财产，想到董存瑞炸碉堡！”（葛家理）
    认真负责的监工员
    鞍钢第二铸铁机工地上，有一个新派去的监工员——杨贵文。他有三十年的铸铁经验，已经是近六十岁的人了，因为他没作过监工，有些图纸看不懂，再加上文化水平低，工作起来是有些困难的。但他说：“党既然把任务交给我，再困难也要完成。因为这是全国人民最关心的地方。”
    自从他到工地以后，每天围绕工程区跑几十遍，工人们随时都见他手里拿着尺子，这里量一量那里看一看。他除自己想办法改进工作外，还动员大家提问题。他把工地里发现的问题带回家去让他儿子帮他记，他对儿子说：“你给我往本子上记，也算你参加了基本建设。”到工地一个多月，他的笔记本上已经记上四十多个合理化建议了，这些建议已大部实现。如他建议把四马机道翻铁支柱修好，代替翻渣支柱使用，给国家节省了许多财力和人力。又如他发现一个大牙轮（马机中枢的重要机件之一，有一千多公斤重）的里边高出二十粍，如果这样安上去就要大返工，不然在试车时也要出事故。他恐怕自己年纪大了记性不好，又和图纸对证一下，才证明的确是高出二十粍。经他建议，又重车了一遍，避免了事故和浪费。（薛万仁）
    魏显柱冒险救火
    十二月十四日下午，浦镇车站修理厂里，有两个稍懂技术的临时工到氧气筒那里去压风表，风压太大了，风表破裂，氧气燃烧起来。正在切铁板的熔接工小组长魏显柱，一见情势危急就往冒火的地方跑去，一个仓库员喊道：“老魏，很危险，去不得！”眼看氧气筒就要爆炸，的确很危险。但是魏显柱知道周围的环境：三十平方公尺的圈子内有油库、材料库……，还有一、二十个工人同志。于是他说道：“我一个人的生命不要紧，我要尽力抢救！”说着他就迅速地跑过去。
    快接近氧气筒了，他就伏在地上爬，爬到了，可是没有螺丝把，开关无法拧紧，他又跑回来取螺丝把。时间一秒一秒地过去，危险性越来越大了。当他重新爬去的时候，站在远处的人们都为他捏着一把汗。转眼之间，魏显柱拧紧了氧气筒的开关，火就熄灭了。有人问：“老魏，你哪来的那股劲？”他笑着说：“我们要建设社会主义，爱护国家财产是我们工人的光荣职责。”（曹志坚）
    十三天完成一个月的任务
    在云南铁工厂机工车间里，一面惹人注意的“个人优胜流动红旗”，随着开动着的牛头刨床飘来荡去。在这刨床旁边工作的是青年团员刘芸生。就是他，十三天完成了一个月的任务。
    增产节约运动中，刘芸生制订了增产百分之十的计划。十月份，他改良了销子夹具，使它能夹两个销子，大大缩短了辅助时间。后来他在刨床上用两把刨刀刨两个产品，使劳动生产率提高了一倍。这一月他超额完成增产节约计划百分之十七点八。
    刘芸生并不满足这些成绩，他日日夜夜开动脑筋，总想要掌握机工车间产品复杂的特点。有一天，他记起了苏联电影中一个纱厂女工提高看台能力的事。他想：我们刨工是不是也能多看一台刨床呢？经过仔细考虑后，他把主要精力放在刨小的产品的一台刨床上，并兼管刨大的产品的一台刨床，干起来并不费多大劲。结果，十一月份的任务，十三天便完成了。（何熔）
    不怕山高坡陡，把机器送到工地
    十月间，山西省工业局要求邯郸运输分公司把一部蒸汽机由邯郸运到长治工地去。这是一个紧急而艰巨的任务。不仅公司里没有载重车只好用一般车辆来运输，而且要通过一些深沟、陡坡和崎岖的山路。共产党员赵志华勇敢地接受了这个任务。公司里特派了三个有经验的老司机去协助他。
    出发后的第二天通过了邯长路上头一个难关——“石梁桥”，第三天出发不远，通过了满路大小石头的“慢牛沟”。再往前走就是高十丈左右的一个陡山坡，路面很窄，一边是高山，一边是三十多丈深的大山沟，再加上机器高大，车子走起来很不稳当。这时赵志华想：机器运不到，几千工人不能开工生产，就要影响工业建设。于是他向大家说：“同志们！工人阶级面前没有克服不了的困难，一定要完成任务。我来开车！”车开到接近坡顶时，机器重量全移到后边，前边车轮已经起来了。这时预先布置好的人，就扑到车头上，把抬起的车头压了下去。在下坡时，机器重量全移到前面，压的两个前轮和方向盘都扭不动了。他毫不畏惧地用尽全身力量才扭动了车轮，借着压力慢慢滑下了山坡。其余两辆车也按照这样顺利地开了过去。
    天已经黑了，离工地还有六十多里崎岖不平的山路。赵志华等同志一心想要祖国的矿山能早日开工，顾不上吃饭就连夜赶到工地。山西省工业局为了感谢赵志华运输小组的艰苦努力，特赠给他们锦旗一面。（中共邯郸地委直属党委会）
