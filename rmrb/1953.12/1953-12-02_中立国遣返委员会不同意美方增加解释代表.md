Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 1st – The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, in an official communiqué released on the evening of November 30th, rejected another demand from the US side that violated the "Terms of Reference." The US side had requested to send fifteen representatives to explain to 351 South Korean, American, and British prisoners of war in the northern POW camp in the demilitarized zone. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission told the US side: "The total number of explanation representatives allowed to work in the North Camp shall not exceed five at any one time." The Commission further stated that this number was based on Item A of Clause 8 of the "Terms of Reference." According to this clause: "The number of such explanation representatives shall not exceed seven per one thousand prisoners of war under the care of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, but the minimum total number permitted shall not be less than five."

The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission pointed out that the US side "revised" Item A of Clause 8—interpreting "the minimum total number permitted shall not be less than five" as "the minimum total number permitted for each country to which the prisoners of war belong shall not be less than five." The Commission said: "Such a revision of Item A of Clause 8 is unjustified, whether based on the context of Clause 8 or on any standard of legitimate interpretation."

It is remembered that when the "Terms of Reference" were drafted in Panmunjom, it was the US negotiator Harrison who insisted on setting the number of explanation representatives as low as possible in order to prevent prisoners of war from returning home and to gain a "victory" in "psychological warfare." During the armistice negotiations, he insisted that there should be only one explanation representative for every thousand prisoners of war. This was clearly to limit the number of Korean and Chinese explanation representatives in order to detain a large number of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war.

### 中立国遣返委员会不同意美方增加解释代表

    中立国遣返委员会不同意美方增加解释代表
    【新华社开城一日电】中立国遣返委员会在十一月三十日晚发表的正式公报中，拒绝了美方又一个违反“职权范围”的要求。美方曾经要求派遣十五名代表去向非军事区北部战俘营的三百五十一名南朝鲜、美国和英国战俘进行解释。中立国遣返委员会对美方说：“可以容许在北营进行工作的解释代表总数，在任何一次，均不得超过五名。”委员会又说：这一数额的根据是“职权范围”第八款甲项。按该款规定：“此类解释代表的数目，在中立国遣返委员会看管下的每一千名战俘中不得超过七人，但被准许的最低总数不得少于五人”。
    中立国遣返委员会指出：美方“改订了”第八款甲项——把“被准许的最低总数不得少于五人”解释为“战俘所属每一国被准许的最低总数不得少于五人”。委员会说：“这样改订第八款甲项，无论是根据第八款上下文或是根据任何合法解释的标准，都是没有理由的。”
    人们还记得：在板门店起草“职权范围”时，正是美方谈判代表哈利逊坚持要把解释代表数目定得尽可能低，以便阻止战俘回家，获得“心理战”的“胜利”。在停战谈判时，他坚持说：每一千名战俘中只应有一个解释代表。这显然是为了限制朝中解释代表的数目，以便扣留大量朝中战俘。
