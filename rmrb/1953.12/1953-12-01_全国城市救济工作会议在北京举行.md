    National Urban Relief Work Conference Held in Beijing

    [Xinhua News Agency] The National Urban Relief Work Conference was held in Beijing from November 11th to 24th. Participants included responsible persons from the China People's Relief Association's offices in major administrative regions, relief branches in various provinces and cities, and civil affairs departments in relevant large and medium-sized cities handling urban relief work.

    Li Dequan, Vice Chairman of the China People's Relief Association, delivered the opening speech. She pointed out that since the 1952 China People's Relief Association work conference, urban relief work has greatly improved, but there are still some shortcomings. This conference must implement the spirit of the general line of the state during the transition period, study, discuss, and solve existing problems in the work, and further improve future urban relief work.

    The conference summarized the achievements of urban relief work. In recent years, urban relief work has achieved great results due to the joint efforts of the broad masses of the people and all relief work cadres under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and governments at all levels. Production and education institutions in various regions have taken in vagrants, prostitutes, and petty thieves left over from the old society, as well as destitute and helpless disabled elderly and orphans, enabling vagrants who did not work for a living to become new people engaged in labor through education and transformation, and enabling the disabled elderly and orphans to receive appropriate education and resettlement. Cities across the country have also provided relief to impoverished citizens. In addition, more than 420 relief agencies that accepted imperialist subsidies were taken over and transformed, and more than 1,600 old social relief welfare organizations were reorganized, making these relief agencies beneficial to the people's relief and welfare undertakings. The conference reviewed the shortcomings in the relief work, criticized the purely relief-oriented viewpoint, and the erroneous practice of taking on everything while being divorced from reality.

    After listening to the report by Xie Juezai, Vice Chairman of the China People's Relief Association, on the general line and general tasks of the state during the transition period, and the report by Wang Yifu, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government, on how to implement the general line in urban relief work, the conference conducted in-depth discussions, criticized erroneous ideas existing in the relief work, and studied future urban relief work in detail.

    The conference was finally summarized by Wu Yunfu, Secretary-General of the China People's Relief Association. He proposed that the main tasks of future urban relief work are: to continue to rectify production and education work, to rectify production undertakings in production and education institutions, to establish systems, and to further improve production and education work; to organize impoverished citizens to help each other with labor, engage in production for self-salvation, and do a good job in relieving impoverished citizens this winter; to continue to adjust old social relief welfare organizations; and to pay attention to training existing relief work cadres. He pointed out that the future working methods should follow the spirit of the general line and oppose the two erroneous ideas of taking on everything and irresponsibly pushing things away. Urban relief work must be carried out in accordance with methods such as combining labor production with education and transformation, and combining government relief with mass self-salvation.

    全国城市救济工作会议在北京举行
    【新华社讯】全国城市救济工作会议于十一月十一日至二十四日在北京举行。参加会议的有中国人民救济总会各大行政区办事处、各省市救济分会及有关的大、中城市民政部门办理城市救济工作的负责人。
    会议由中国人民救济总会副主席李德全致开幕词。她指出：从一九五二年中国人民救济总会工作会议以来，城市救济工作已有了很大改进，但还有一些缺点。这次会议必须贯彻国家在过渡时期的总路线的精神，研究、讨论、解决工作中存在的问题，进一步做好今后的城市救济工作。
    会议总结了城市救济工作的成绩。几年来，城市救济工作由于广大人民和全体救济工作干部，在中国共产党和各级人民政府的正确领导下，共同努力，得到了很大的成绩。各地生产教养机构曾收容了旧社会遗留下来的乞丐、妓女、小偷等游民和贫苦的无依无靠的残老、孤儿等，使不劳而食的游民经过教育改造，变成了从事劳动的新人，使残老、孤儿得到了适当的教养和安置。全国各城市还对贫苦市民进行了救济。此外，还接收和改造了接受帝国主义津贴的四百二十多处救济机关，整理了一千六百多处旧有的社会救济福利团体，使这些救济机关成为有利于人民的救济福利事业。会议检讨了救济工作中存在的缺点，批判了那种单纯的救济观点和把一切都包下来的脱离现实的错误作法。
    会议在听取了中国人民救济总会副主席谢觉哉关于国家在过渡时期总路线、总任务的报告和中央人民政府内务部副部长王一夫关于在城市救济工作中如何贯彻总路线的报告之后，进行了深入的讨论，对救济工作中存在的错误思想作了批判，并详细地研究了今后的城市救济工作。
    会议最后由中国人民救济总会秘书长伍云甫作了总结。他提出今后城市救济工作的主要任务是：继续整顿生产教养工作，整顿生产教养机构中的生产事业，建立制度，使生产教养工作得到进一步改进；组织贫苦市民劳动互助，生产自救，做好今冬贫苦市民的救济工作；继续调整旧有的社会救济福利团体；注意培养现有的救济工作干部。他指出：今后的工作方法，应该遵循总路线的精神，反对把一切包下来和不负责任的推出去的两种错误思想。城市救济工作必须依照劳动生产与教育改造相结合、政府救济与群众自救相结合等办法来进行。
