    This Farm Receives Praise from Farmers
    By our reporter Zhang Rongan
    The small-scale peasant economy of China's vast rural areas is not only extremely scattered in its management methods, but also very backward in its production technology. As our country implements the great socialist transformation of this scattered and backward small-scale peasant economy, agricultural technology transformation is also developing step by step along with the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. China's thousands of state-owned farms are playing an active leading and exemplary role in the process of agricultural technology transformation and improvement. The Wendeng County Farm in Shandong Province, which I am introducing, is one of them.
    When state-owned farms are mentioned, people always associate them with large tractors roaring across fertile yellow soil on vast lands; in summer, endless waves of golden wheat; and in autumn, crops like a green ocean. The Wendeng County Farm is not like that. They are close to the eastern coast of the Shandong Peninsula, with undulating mountains and crisscrossing rivers, and there are no large flat areas at all. They only cultivate 92.5 mu of scattered small plots of land. They also lack the most basic equipment of a modern farm, using five draft animals, a new-style walking plow, and a 700x microscope. Before last year, the farm staff lived in the Land Temple in Gaochun Town, Wendeng County. Most of the farm cadres lacked agricultural scientific knowledge and farm work experience. Except for farm director Zhang Huanong, who joined the farm in 1943, most of the cadres were successively transferred from local party and government departments. However, they have done a good job in the farm's own production based on the existing manpower and equipment, and with high yields, they have demonstrated the superiority of their management and advanced technology, attracting the attention of the broad masses of farmers around them. Listen to what the farmers have to say about them! Whenever the Wendeng County Farm is mentioned, local farmers always say: "Land where even grass doesn't grow can grow good crops in the hands of the farm; this group of people is not ambiguous, they have really done great things for us farmers!"
    Why do farmers praise the Wendeng County Farm like this? This can be known by looking at their production records over the years and comparing them with the yields of farmers near the farm. Taking last year as an example: the average corn yield of the farm was 570 jin per mu, and the highest yield of farmers was 480 jin; the average dry rice yield of the farm was 473 jin per mu, and the farmers' yield was 287 jin per mu; the average radish yield of the farm was 8,350 jin per mu, and the farmers' yield was 1,900 jin per mu; the average peanut yield of the farm was 236 jin per mu, and the farmers' yield was 155 jin per mu. It is especially worth mentioning that the land on the farm is very bad, mostly clay, and the soil is as hard as a stone. The farmers said: "These people are really good at growing crops, even bad land has become high-yield fields." Because the farm's crops are grown well, farmers are willing to learn from them. This spring, Zhou Shicong, a farmer in Gaochun Town, was going to Weihai City. Before he left, his father asked him: "How to plant spring corn this year?" Zhou Shicong said: "You should go to the farm often to see how they plant, and you plant the same way." This autumn, the farm's wheat was sown early, and the surrounding farmers also followed suit.
    Farmers praise the Wendeng County Farm not only for this point, but more importantly, this farm is good at relying on the masses in promoting agricultural technology, taking materials locally, starting from the actual conditions of the local rural areas, making thorough plans for the farmers, and constantly using facts to overcome the farmers' conservative ideas, so that the farmers consciously and voluntarily accept new technologies, thereby increasing grain production and gaining the farmers' trust in them.
    Gaochun Town is a large market town in Wendeng County. It is accessible in all directions and very lively. Farmers from dozens of miles around come here to the market, and those who come to the market have to go to the farm to take a look. People come to see how the farm's crops are growing and what new methods there are; secondly, they discuss their own crop planting with Director Zhang and ask him to answer various questions. I encountered many such occasions at the farm.
    One autumn evening, I was talking with Farm Director Zhang Huanong in the farm office when Bi Shuzeng, an old man from Fengtaiding Village, came. As soon as he entered the door, he said: "I haven't seen our director for several days! I'm wondering at home."
    "My wheat has not been sown yet, I'm here to ask you for advice," Old Man Bi said to Director Zhang.
    "How do you plan to plant?" Director Zhang asked.
    "I planted four mu of wheat last year, and I plan to plant five mu this year, what do you think?" Old Man Bi said, waiting for Director Zhang's answer.
      "How much fertilizer have you prepared?"
      "I don't plan to use hard fertilizer (i.e. cake fertilizer) this year, only use forty carts of green manure, and I plan to use more ammonium sulfate as top dressing next year."
    Director Zhang did not answer, but shook his head.
    Seeing that Director Zhang did not answer, Old Man Bi continued to explain:
      "I saw the news in the newspaper that Tian Shuying, a military dependent in Wulongzui, had a bumper wheat harvest this year. People only used compost and green manure, and the average yield per mu was 508 jin of wheat. I am learning from them by not using hard fertilizer." After speaking, he carefully examined Director Zhang's expression.
    After a while, Director Zhang said:
    "I think your labor force is poor and you don't have enough fertilizer. I'm afraid that planting too much will reduce production."
      "Look at this!" -- Old Man Bi turned around and said to me -- "Our director is always hitting nails, but the more he hits me, the more I want to come to him."
    Director Zhang continued:
      "I know that most of your wheat fields this year are stubble fields. I'm afraid that the wheat will mature late next year and the grains will not be real; the fertilizer you use lacks phosphorus, and the wheat is prone to lodging. It is best to use another 15 to 20 jin of superphosphate per mu of wheat. As for the news published in the newspaper, I know that it is not completely written. Tian Shuying not only used compost and green manure, but also used 160 jin of cake fertilizer and 45 jin of chemical fertilizer." Saying that, he opened his notebook and gave it to Old Man Bi to read.
    Old Man Bi put on his reading glasses and carefully looked at the notebook for a while before nodding and saying: "Oh! That's clear!"
    Old Man Bi was anxious to leave, his wife was ill and he had to rush back to serve her!
    As soon as Old Man Bi went out the door, Director Zhang rushed up again, patted him on the shoulder and said: "Superphosphate can't be used too much, too much, it can't be absorbed; our farm used more than 40 jin per mu of wheat last year, and only harvested 5 jin more per mu, it's not worth it!"
    "I heard it a long time ago!"
    Old Man Bi hurriedly left without even turning his head.
    The next evening, I went to Farm Director Zhang Huanong again. Deputy Farm Director Jiang greeted me with a smile and said: "Director Zhang is worried about Old Man Bi's wheat planting, and just went to Fengtaiding again!"
    After that, I found that Director Zhang Huanong went to the village almost every night.
    Every time I talked to the farmers of Wendeng County about the Wendeng County Farm, people always liked to talk about the year 1946. That summer, a plot of land near the road on the farm was planted with the excellent variety of flat-spike wheat. It grew so well! The ears were large, the grains were dense, and the stalks were short and stout. Although the ears of wheat were heavy, not a single plant lodged. Which farmer who came to visit was not envious and surprised! They caressed the ears of wheat with love, and rubbed the grains off one by one to count them. Each ear of wheat had 60 to 100 grains, which was one to two times more than the number of grains of the red sudden head wheat they planted themselves.
    That year, the farm harvested 108 jin more wheat per mu than the farmers.
    Why do farmers love flat-spike wheat so much? Why do people still talk about it with such relish even after so many years? There is a reason for this. Originally, wheat, as the main crop of Wendeng County, had extremely low yields before liberation (before 1936), only 60 jin per mu, and 120 jin was the sky! After the farmers paid rent to the landlords and taxes to the reactionary government, there was almost nothing left. In that year, the farm distributed the flat-spike wheat it harvested to 22 labor models in the county to plant. The following year, the wheat of these labor models had a bumper harvest, yielding 60 jin more per mu than the average farmer. Farmers rushed to exchange seeds with the labor models. Up to now, 95 percent of the farmers and 90 percent of the wheat fields in the county have planted this kind of wheat.
    Since the Wendeng County Farm promoted the excellent variety of flat-spike wheat, helped farmers eliminate wheat smut disease, improved farming techniques, and used fertilizer rationally, on the basis of farmers organizing to actively produce, the wheat yield in Wendeng County has been increasing year by year. Last year, the average wheat yield per mu in the county was more than 190 jin, and Wendeng County became a high-yield wheat county in East China. The farmers have produced more grain and their lives have improved. Old farmer Bi Shuzeng divided his personal experience of life into three different historical eras: before the Anti-Japanese War, he had little to eat and wear. In famine years, people peeled bark and ate it ten miles away; during the Anti-Japanese War, he had food and clothing. In famine years, the anti-Japanese democratic government provided loans and food; after defeating Chiang Kai-shek and returning the land home, the farmers responded to Chairman Mao's call to organize, and the farm promoted technology, which made them prosperous every year. In lean years, people not only did not peel bark and eat it ten miles away, but no one even ate the radish leaves in front of their homes.
    The Wendeng County Farm has another great achievement for the farmers, which the farmers will never forget. This is that after several years of efforts by the farm, the wheat smut disease that spread throughout the county has been eliminated. The significance of eliminating wheat smut disease is as important as promoting the excellent variety of flat-spike wheat. The farmers clearly remember the tragic scene of their previous suffering from wheat smut disease, which was so terrible! Like a plague, whoever's land was infected was doomed. Hou Guixing, a farmer in Sanhoujia Village, District 3, Wendeng County, planted a piece of wheat, and half of it was affected. The summer harvest of wheat was not enough to cover the cost of labor and capital. There was not enough food to eat, and the whole family quarreled all day long. His wife scolded him as a "disaster star" (meaning a prodigal), and Hou Guixing himself thought that he was "out of luck". He was at the end of his rope and prepared to flee to the Northeast.
    People all remember a person in an old gray uniform - Zhang Huanong, carrying the microscope of the county health hospital (at that time they did not have their own microscope), running around in the wind and rain, explaining the transmission route of wheat smut disease to farmers, and teaching them how to prevent it. Zhang Huanong spent a lot of effort on this matter! Before he found a way to prevent wheat smut disease, his brain ached from thinking about it. He read books and visited old farmers everywhere. This method was finally found in an ordinary farmer's place. The matter is like this, Zhang Shuqian, a farmer in Xiaotai Village, planted a piece of wheat in 1936. Because locusts ate the wheat seedlings around it, there was no manure for replanting, so he did not fertilize and planted the wheat in the ground. The following year, when the wheat matured, none of the replanted wheat suffered from smut disease, and the earlier planted wheat suffered from it very seriously. This incident caused a sensation in the whole village. The farmers understood that the root of wheat smut disease was in the manure. In the past, the farmers in this village mixed wheat seeds with manure before sowing. After that, they spread the manure first and then sowed, isolating the manure from the wheat seeds. From then on, wheat smut disease disappeared in this village. But at that time, it was the dark age of Kuomintang rule, and this valuable experience of the farmers was buried. Although this village had eliminated wheat smut disease long ago, other villages were still very seriously infected. After Zhang Huanong learned this method, he made a demonstration of isolating manure and seeds for sowing wheat on the farm. It was very lively! The farmers heard that the farm had a method to prevent wheat smut disease, and they all came to visit. The secretary of the Wendeng County Committee of the Communist Party of China also came to the farm to publicize it to the visitors. The farm also sent people to various villages to publicize it to the farmers. Some farmers still did not believe it for a while, thinking that wheat was infected with smut disease because people were not in good spirits. The farm helped them use this method to plant a piece of wheat, and it was guaranteed to be planted and harvested. The farm also mobilized all the labor models and mutual aid groups in the county to adopt this method first. In this way, the farmers slowly believed it.
    From 1949 to 1953, the Wendeng County Farm increased the wheat production of farmers in the county by at least 685.5 million jin due to the promotion of the excellent variety of flat-spike wheat and the method of preventing wheat smut disease.
    When talking about the Wendeng County Farm, we cannot fail to mention Farm Director Zhang Huanong. His spirit of serving the masses is particularly good. He really puts in a lot of effort for the things that the masses want him to do. For example, in 1944, in order to promote well-drilling in mountainous areas, develop water sources, and help farmers overcome droughts, he worked with well-drilling workers in the severe winter, braving heavy snow to drill eleven wells for the farmers in a row. He himself carried out strong labor operations such as panning wells and masonry wells at the bottom of the wells, and since then learned the well-drilling technology and taught the farmers how to drill wells. His work style is very good. If the masses encounter something and look for him, he is sure to arrive if he is asked, and he will work with the farmers as soon as he arrives. Some farmers said: "Director Zhang is really helping us grow crops hand in hand!" His learning spirit is also very good. When talking about agricultural scientific knowledge, no one can tell that he is a cadre from a peasant background. He is very humble and not at all complacent about the achievements that the Wendeng Farm has made. He is planning the future of the farm.
    He once told me with confidence: "Don't look at the fact that we are in a mountainous area here, maybe we won't use large tractors in the future, but we have the conditions for planting trees here; we want to guide the farmers to build this vast mountain area into a beautiful orchard." Indeed, when I left the farm, they were planning to breed improved varieties of fruit seedlings in 1954.

    这个农场受到农民的赞扬
    本报记者　张荣安
    我国广大农村的小农经济，不仅在经营方式上是极其分散的，而且在生产技术上也是十分落后的。当我们国家对这种分散落后的小农经济实行伟大的社会主义改造时，随着互助合作运动的开展，农业技术的改造工作也在相应地逐步发展着。我国数以千计的国营农场，在对农业技术改造和提高的进程中，起着积极的带头作用和示范作用。我所介绍的山东省文登县农场就是其中的一个。
    提到国营农场，人们总会联想到在广阔的土地上，冒着青烟的大拖拉机翻滚着肥沃的黄土；夏天，一眼看不到头的黄色麦浪；秋天的庄稼像碧绿的海洋。文登县农场可不是这样，他们靠近山东半岛东部的海岸，山峦起伏，河流交错，根本没有大块平地。他们只种着九十二亩半分散的小块土地。他们还缺乏现代化农场起码的设备，使用着五匹牲口，一具新式步犁，一架七百倍的显微镜；去年以前，农场的工作人员还住在文登县高村镇的土地庙里。农场的干部大多数缺少农业科学知识和农场工作的经验，除了场长张华农是在一九四三年就参加了农场工作外，大部分干部是陆续从地方党政工作部门调来的。但是，他们就在现有的人力和设备的基础上作好了农场本身的生产，用高额的产量，显示出他们经营管理和先进技术的优越性，把广大农民的注意力吸引在自己的周围。请听听农民对他们的评论吧！只要提到文登县农场，当地农民总是这样说：“连草都不长的地，在农场手里能长好庄稼；这班人马不含糊，人家真给咱庄稼人办了大事啦！”
    为什么农民会这样赞扬文登县农场呢？这只要看看他们历年的生产记录，并和农场附近农民的产量作个对比就知道了。以去年为例：农场的玉米每亩平均五百七十斤，农民最高产量是四百八十斤；农场的旱稻每亩平均四百七十三斤，农民一亩二百八十七斤；农场的萝卜每亩平均八千三百五十斤，农民一亩一千九百斤；农场的花生米每亩平均二百三十六斤，农民一亩一百五十五斤。特别值得提到的是农场的土地很坏，大部分是黏土质，土块硬得像石块一样。农民们说：“这伙人真是种庄稼能手，连坏地也变成了丰产田。”因为农场庄稼种得好，农民都愿意向他们学习。高村镇农民周世聪今年春天要到威海市去，动身前他父亲问他：“今年春玉米怎么种？”周世聪说：“你勤到农场看着，人家怎么种，你就怎么种。”今年秋天，农场的小麦提前下种了，周围的农民也都跟着早下种。
    农民赞扬文登县农场还不只因为这一点，更重要的是这个农场在推广农业技术方面，善于依靠群众，就地取材，从当地农村的实际条件出发，周到地给农民打算，不断用事实来克服农民的保守思想，使农民自觉自愿地接受新技术，从而多打了粮食，得到农民对他们的信任。
    高村镇是文登县的一个大集镇，四通八达，很热闹，周围数十里的农民都来这里赶集，来赶集的人又都要到农场看一看。人们一来看看农场的庄稼长得怎么样，又有了什么新办法儿没有；二来和张场长商量商量自己种庄稼的事，提出各种各样的问题要他来解答。我在农场时就碰到很多这样的场合。
    一个秋天的黄昏，在农场办公室里，我正和张华农场长谈话，凤台顶村的农民毕庶增老汉来了。他一进门就说：“好几天不见咱场长啦！在家里纳闷儿。”
    “我的麦子还没有下种，找你拿拿主意。”毕老汉和张场长说。
    “你打算怎么种？”张场长问。
    “去年我种四亩小麦，今年打算种五亩，你看行不？”毕老汉说完后等待着张场长的回答。
      “你准备了多少肥料？”
      “我今年不打算使硬肥（即饼肥），只使四十车绿肥，准备明年多使硫酸錏作追肥。”
    张场长没有回答，只摇了摇头。
    毕老汉见张场长没有回答，就又解释下去：
      “我在报上看到五龙嘴军属田树英今年小麦丰产的消息，人家光用圈肥、绿肥，一亩地就平均收了五百零八斤小麦，我不使硬肥是向人家学的。”说完他端详着张场长的表情。
    停了一会儿，张场长才说：
    “我看你劳动力差，肥料也不足，多种怕要减产。”
      “你瞧瞧！”——毕老汉回过头来向我说——“我们的场长就是会给钉子碰，可是他越给碰我就越想来找他。”
    张场长又继续说：
      “我知道，今年你的麦地大部分是改茬地，怕明年小麦会晚熟，籽粒不成实；你使的肥料缺少磷素，小麦容易倒伏，最好每亩小麦再使十五斤到二十斤过磷酸钙。至于报上登的那个消息，我知道写的不完全，田树英不光上圈肥和绿肥，还上了一百六十斤饼肥，四十五斤化学肥料。”说着他把笔记本摊开送给毕老汉看。
    毕老汉戴上老花镜仔细把笔记本看了一阵才点了点头说：“唔！这就清亮啦！”
    毕老汉急着要走了，他的老伴儿害病，还要赶回去服侍老伴儿！
    毕老汉刚出了门，张场长又赶上去拍着他的肩膀说：“过磷酸钙可不能多使，太多，吸收不了；我们农场去年一亩小麦使了四十多斤，每亩只多收了五斤小麦，不合算啊！”
    “早听说啦！”
    毕老汉头也没回就急急忙忙地走了。
    第二天晚上，我又去找张华农场长，姜副场长迎上来笑着说：“张场长对毕老汉种麦子不放心，刚才又到凤台顶去啦！”
    此后，我发现张华农场长差不多每天晚上都要到村里去。
    我每次和文登县农民谈到文登县农场时，人们总是爱谈一九四六年这一年。这年夏天，农场靠近大道边的一块地里，种着优良品种扁穗小麦。长得多好啊！穗头大、籽粒密，秆子短而粗壮，虽然麦穗压得沉甸甸地，但没有一株倒伏。来参观的农民那一个不羡慕、不惊奇！他们抚摩着麦穗爱不释手，又把麦粒搓下来一粒一粒地数，每穗麦粒有六十粒到一百粒，比他们自己种的红突头小麦的籽粒数目多一倍到两倍。
    这年农场小麦每亩比农民多收一百零八斤。
    为什么农民这样爱扁穗小麦呢？为什么事情已经过了好几年人们谈论起来还是那末津津有味呢？这是有原因的。原来作为文登县主要农作物的小麦，解放前（一九三六年前）产量极低，每亩只能收六十多斤，收一百二十斤就顶塌天啦！农民除了给地主交租和给反动政府纳税外，简直剩不下多少。就在这一年，农场把自己收下来的扁穗小麦分给全县二十二个劳动模范去种。来年，这些劳动模范的小麦都丰收了，每亩比一般农民多收六十多斤。农民们抢着和劳动模范换种。到现在，全县已经有百分之九十五的农户和百分之九十的麦地种这种小麦。
    自从文登县农场推广优良品种扁穗小麦以来，并帮助农民消灭了小麦腥黑穗病害，改善了耕作技术，合理使用肥料，在农民组织起来积极生产的基础上，文登县小麦产量是逐年上升的。到去年，全县小麦平均每亩产量是一百九十多斤，文登县成了华东区的小麦丰产县。农民多打了粮食生活也改善了。老农民毕庶增把他亲身经历的生活划成三个不同的历史时代：抗日战争以前是少吃少穿，碰到灾荒年头，人们到十里地以外剥树皮吃；抗日战争时期是有吃有穿，碰到灾荒年头抗日民主政府贷款贷粮；打败蒋介石土地回家，农民响应毛主席号召组织起来，农场推广技术，是年年富裕，碰到歉收人们不但不到十里地以外剥树皮吃，连家门口的萝卜叶也没人吃了。
    文登县农场对农民还有另一件大功绩，也是农民永远不能忘记的。这就是经过农场几年的努力，消灭了蔓延全县的小麦腥黑穗病害。消灭小麦腥黑穗病害的意义和推广优良品种扁穗小麦比较起来是同等重要的。农民们很清楚的记忆着先前他们遭受小麦腥黑穗病害的惨景，是多末可怕啊！像瘟疫一样，传染到谁的地里谁就该倒楣。文登县第三区三侯家村农民侯贵兴种着一块小麦，受害的就有一半，夏天收下麦子连工本钱都不够。粮食不够吃，合家老小成天吵架，老婆骂他是“丧门”（即败家子的意思），侯贵兴自己也认为走了“倒运”，走头无路准备到东北去逃荒。
    人们都记得，一个穿着一身旧灰制服的人——张华农，背着县卫生院的显微镜（那时他们自己还没有显微镜），风里雨里到处奔跑，给农民讲解小麦腥黑穗病的传染途径，教会他们防治的办法。张华农为这事可费了大劲啦！在他没有找到防治小麦腥黑穗病的办法以前，脑子想得都疼起来了。他翻阅书籍，到处访问老农，这种办法终于在一个普通农民那里找到了。事情是这样的，小台村农民张树乾，在一九三六年种过一块小麦，因为蚂蚱把四周围的麦苗吃掉了，补种时没有粪了，他就没上粪把麦子种到地里。来年麦子成熟了，补种的小麦没有
  一株患腥黑穗病，先种的小麦患腥黑穗病还很严重。这件事一时轰动了全村，农民们明白了，原来小麦腥黑穗病的根子在粪里。以前，这村农民都是把麦种和粪拌在一起下种，这以后就先撒粪后播种，使粪和麦种隔离，从此这村小麦腥黑穗病就绝迹了。但那时是国民党统治的黑暗时代，农民这种宝贵的经验就被埋没了，尽管这村早已消灭了小麦腥黑穗病，别村还是传染的很厉害。张华农学得这种办法后，就在农场作粪种隔离播种小麦的示范。好热闹哪！农民听说农场有了防治小麦腥黑穗病害的办法，都来参观，中共文登县委书记也来到农场对参观的人进行宣传。农场又派人到各村给农民宣传。有的农民一时还不相信，认为小麦得了腥黑穗病是因为人不走时气，农场就帮助他们用这种办法种一块小麦，并且是包种包收。农场并动员全县劳动模范和互助组先采用这种办法。这样农民才慢慢地相信了。
    文登县农场由于推广优良品种扁穗小麦和防治小麦腥黑穗病的办法，从一九四九年到一九五三年，至少使全县农民增产小麦六亿八千五百多万斤。
    谈到文登县农场，就不能不谈张华农场长。他为群众服务的精神特别好，群众要他办的事，他真卖力气。像在一九四四年，他为了在山地推广打井，开发水源，帮助农民战胜旱灾，曾在严寒的冬天，冒着大雪和打井工人在一起给农民一连打了十一眼井，他自己在井底下进行淘井、砌井等强力劳动作业，从此学会了打井技术，并教会农民打井。他的工作作风很好，群众遇事找他，有请必到，一到就和农民在一起劳动。有些农民说：“张场长真是手捉着手帮助咱种庄稼哩！”他的学习精神也很好，谈起农业科学知识来，谁都看不出他是个农民出身的干部。他很谦虚，对于文登农场已得的成绩，一点也不自满。他正在策划着农场的未来。
    他曾满怀信心对我说：“你不要看我们这里是山地，也许将来用不上大拖拉机，可是这里种树有条件；我们要引导农民把这辽阔的山野建设成美丽的果园。”的确，当我离开农场的时候，他们正计划着在一九五四年培育果苗的良种了。
