    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, December 10th: According to TASS, the number of savings deposits in Soviet savings banks has greatly increased, reflecting the rising living standards of the Soviet people.
    Currently, there are approximately 44,000 savings banks in the Soviet Union. In the first ten months of this year, the number of depositors in these banks increased by five million. By the end of this year, the total amount of deposits in these banks will exceed 36 billion rubles, almost four times more than in 1940 before the war.
    Whether in cities or villages, the number of deposits in savings banks is increasing daily. This situation is particularly noticeable in the years following the end of the Great Patriotic War. For example, a savings bank on Enthusiasts' Street in Moscow had a total deposit of nearly 4 million rubles on January 1, 1941; by January 1, 1951, the total deposit had reached 29 million rubles, and later increased to 46 million rubles. In this year alone, the bank received another 10 million rubles in deposits, and the number of depositors increased by 4,450. In Leningrad, one in every four residents has a savings deposit. The Soviet people regard saving as a virtue, and they can also receive interest and bonuses from their savings. This year, Soviet savings banks paid out 1 billion rubles in interest and bonuses.

    苏联人民都把储蓄当成一种美德
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联储蓄银行的存款数目大大增加，反映出苏联人民的生活水平日益提高。
    目前，苏联约有四万四千家储蓄银行。今年头十个月，在这些银行存款的人数增加了五百万，今年年底这些银行的存款总数将超过三百六十亿卢布，比战前一九四○年几乎增加了四倍。
    无论在城市或乡村，储蓄银行的存款数目都在日益增加，这种情况在卫国战争结束以后的几年内尤其显著。例如，莫斯科“热心者”大街上的一家储蓄银行，在一九四一年一月一日时，存款总数将近四百万卢布；在一九五一年一月一日时，存款总数已达到二千九百万卢布，其后，又增加到四千六百万卢布。单在今年一年，该银行又收进了一千万卢布的存款，存款的人数增加了四千四百五十人。在列宁格勒，每四个居民中就有一人在储蓄银行有存款。苏联人民都把储蓄当成一种美德，他们同时还可从储蓄中得到利息和奖金。今年苏联储蓄银行付出的利息和奖金达十亿卢布。
