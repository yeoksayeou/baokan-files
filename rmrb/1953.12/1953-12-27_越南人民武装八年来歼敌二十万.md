Xinhua News Agency, December 26th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the Vietnamese People's Army newspaper "People's Army Daily" reported that the Vietnamese People's Army's local forces, militia, and guerrillas have achieved great victories in their operations behind enemy lines over the past eight years.

　　In the eight years since 1945, the People's Army local forces, militia, and guerrillas behind enemy lines have destroyed 26 enemy aircraft, 66 locomotives, 106 gunboats and motorboats, and 3,889 various motorcycles; they have seized 29,118 rifles, 7,068 various machine guns, and 1,169 mortars and artillery pieces; they have killed 131,417 enemy soldiers, wounded 48,486, and captured or received the surrender of 27,393 enemy soldiers.

　　In the year from July 1952 to July 1953 alone, the war materials captured by the People's Army local forces, militia, and guerrillas in North Vietnam were enough to equip seven regiments. They killed 31,222 enemy soldiers, wounded 10,235, and captured or received the surrender of 10,559 enemy soldiers.

　　"People's Army Daily" said that the Vietnamese People's Army's local forces, militia, and guerrillas started as isolated guerrilla units equipped with old rifles, but now there are tens of thousands of guerrilla units and hundreds of local forces; the morale, tactics, and techniques of the troops have also improved rapidly. Thousands of outstanding fighters like the female hero Nguyen Thi San have emerged in guerrilla warfare.

　　In the past two or three years, guerrilla bases have also been expanding rapidly. In 1950, the French colonialists stationed troops in almost every part of the Red River Delta in North Vietnam, built barracks, watchtowers, and established puppet governments. By 1951, the enemy occupied almost the entire Red River Delta except for 200 small villages that had established guerrilla bases. But now, the People's Army local forces, militia, and guerrillas behind enemy lines have established many large guerrilla bases here, including more than 2,660 small villages.

　　"People's Army Daily" finally pointed out that the rapid growth and strengthening of the Vietnamese People's Army's local forces, militia, and guerrillas behind enemy lines has posed an increasingly serious threat to the enemy. Now, the enemy no longer dares to act casually with only a few squads of soldiers, as they did in 1947. The enemy must gather many troops to "sweep" an area. For example, in the French army's "sweep" on the north bank of the Luc Giang River this September, seventeen infantry battalions were deployed.

　　In the past few years, the Vietnamese People's Army's local forces, militia, and guerrillas have overcome various difficulties, persisted in the arduous struggle behind enemy lines, and have annihilated a large number of the enemy's living forces, coordinated with the People's Army in combat, contained many of the enemy's mobile units, consolidated and expanded the guerrilla areas and guerrilla bases, protected the lives and property of the people, and powerfully shattered the enemy's vicious conspiracy of "using war to support war" and "using Vietnamese to fight Vietnamese."

    越南人民武装八年来歼敌二十万
    【新华社二十六日讯】据越南通讯社讯：越南人民军机关报“人民军队报”报道：越南人民军地方部队、民兵和游击队在过去八年的敌后作战中获得了巨大战果。
    从一九四五年以来的八年中，在敌后的人民军地方部队、民兵和游击队，击毁敌机二十六架、机车六十六辆、炮艇和汽艇一百零六艘、各种摩托车三千八百八十九辆，缴获步枪二万九千一百一十八支、各种机枪七千零六十八挺、迫击炮和大炮一千一百六十九门；共击毙敌军十三万一千四百一十七名，击伤四万八千四百八十六名，敌军被俘掳和投降的二万七千三百九十三名。
    从一九五二年七月到一九五三年七月这一年中，单是北越的人民军地方部队、民兵和游击队缴获的战利品就足够装备七个团，他们击毙敌军三万一千二百二十二名，击伤一万零二百三十五名，敌军被俘掳或投降的有一万零五百五十九名。
    “人民军队报”说：越南人民军地方部队、民兵、游击队开始时也只是一些以破旧步枪装备起来的孤立的游击部队，而现在已经有了几万个游击部队和几百个地方部队；部队的士气和战术、技术也有了迅速的提高。在游击战中出现了几千名像女英雄阮氏膻这样杰出的战士。
    在最近两三年中，游击基地也在迅速扩大。一九五零年，法国殖民者几乎在北越红河三角洲的每一个地方都驻扎有军队，并修建了营房、瞭望塔和设立伪政府。到一九五一年，在北越除了二百个建立了游击基地的小村庄外，敌人还几乎占领了整个红河三角洲。但是到现在，敌后人民军地方部队、民兵、游击队已经在这里建立起许多大块的游击基地，其中包括二千六百六十多个小村庄。
    “人民军队报”最后指出：越南人民军地方部队、民兵、游击队在敌后迅速地生长、壮大、使敌人受到愈来愈严重的威胁。现在，敌人已不如一九四七年那样，敢于只派出几个班兵力就随便行动了。敌人要“扫荡”一个地区，就必须集结许多军队。例如，今年九月法军在禄江北岸的“扫荡”中，就出动了十七个步兵营。
    越南人民军地方部队、民兵、游击队在这几年中克服了种种困难，坚持敌后的艰苦斗争，他们已大量地歼灭了敌军的有生力量，配合人民军作战，牵制住了许多的敌军机动部队，巩固和扩大了游击区和游击基地，保卫了人民的生命财产，有力地粉碎了敌人“以战养战”、“用越南人打越南人”的恶毒阴谋。
