    “Stone Travel”
    Ding San
    The content of "Stone Travel" is like this: On a mountain road, teams of workers transport stones by handcart every day. Mountain roads are not like flat ground, and a handcart requires two or more people to manage; everyone is sweating profusely. This is not surprising. What's strange is: some are pushing uphill, some are pushing downhill, as if the workers are deliberately pushing stones on the mountain for fun, pushing them up and then down, down and then up. Of course, that's not the case. It turns out that an organization on the East Mountain is building houses, and goes to the West Mountain to quarry stone. The stones are transported from the West Mountain to the foot of the mountain, and then from the foot of the West Mountain to the East Mountain. Coincidentally, two organizations at the foot of the West Mountain are also building houses, and go to the East Mountain to quarry stone, transporting them to the foot of the West Mountain. So, one team goes uphill, one team goes downhill, forming the strange scene of "Stone Travel," and the stones on the carts are almost the same. When workers are asked what's going on, they reply: "Who knows? Each person just pushes their own stones."
    This is a powerful satirical drawing.
    The theme of this drawing is so clear and easy to understand that I don't think it's necessary to explain it with any "isms." What needs to be explained is: its satirical target is not only the "strange scene" on a certain mountain road, but also the "each-minding-their-own-business" ideology and work style existing in certain departments and units. The higher and lower levels don't communicate, they don't interact with each other, you sweep the snow in front of your door, and I take care of the frost on my roof. As for the relationship between this "snow" and "frost," and how the "snow sweeping" work and "frost management" work should be coordinated, assisted, and exchange experiences, that is troublesome, and it is best to leave it alone. What is the result? The result is: "Stone Travel"!
    "Stone Travel" is a waste of labor. Where is the sense of responsibility of the organizers of labor?
    We live in a new era, doing new work. Yesterday's "one-size-fits-all" approach is certainly not suitable, but is that "each-minding-their-own-business" approach a new method that should be adopted today? What we need is reasonable division of labor under unified leadership, and close cooperation on the basis of division of labor.
    This is vivid science, and also vivid art. It is certainly not easy to master this science and art; but if we do not gradually learn this science and art, how can we gradually transition to tomorrow? The key lies in learning. "Stone Travel" is also a learning material. So, let my short essay be considered a reflection on studying this material.

    “石头旅行”
    丁三
    “石头旅行”的内容是这样的：在某山的山路上，天天有成队工人用手推车运石头。山路不比平地，一辆手推车得有两个人或更多人照顾；人人汗如雨下。这不足为奇。奇怪的是：有的向山上推，有的向山下推，好像工人们故意在山上推石头玩，推上去又推下来，推下来又推上去似的。实际上当然不是这么一回事。原来东山上有个机关在造房子，到西山采石，石头从西山上运到山下，再从西山下运到东山上。恰巧西山下有两个机关也在造房子，到东山上采石，向西山下运。所以一队上山，一队下山，形成“石头旅行”的奇景，而车上的石头几乎都是一样的。问工人是怎么一回事，回答是：“谁知道呢？各人只管推各人的石头。”
    这是一幅有力的讽刺画。
    这幅画的主题是那样明白易懂，我想用不着用什么“主义”来加以说明了。要说明的是：它所讽刺的对象，不仅是某山山路上的“奇景”，而且是存在于某些部门、某些单位的“各管各”的思想作风。上下不通气，彼此不往来，你扫你门前的雪，我管我瓦上的霜。至于这“雪”和“霜”的关系如何，“扫雪”工作和“管霜”工作应如何配合、互助、交流经验，那是麻烦事，少管为妙。结果怎样呢？结果是：“石头旅行”！
    “石头旅行”是劳动力的浪费。劳动力的组织者的责任感在哪里？
    我们生活在新的时代，干着新的工作。昨天的“一揽子”作法当然是不适用了，但那样“各管各”的作法，难道是今天应该采用的新方法？我们需要的是在统一领导下合理分工，在分工基础上亲密合作。
    这是生动的科学，也是生动的艺术。要掌握这种科学和艺术，当然是不容易的；但不逐渐学会这种科学和艺术，我们又怎能逐步过渡到明天？关键在于学习。“石头旅行”也是一份学习的材料。那么，我的这篇短文，就算是学习这份材料的心得吧。
