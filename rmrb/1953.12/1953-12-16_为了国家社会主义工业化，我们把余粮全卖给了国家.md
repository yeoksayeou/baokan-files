For National Socialist Industrialization, We Sold All Our Surplus Grain to the State
Beijing Municipal Model Agricultural Laborer, Director of Zhangguozhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative, Fengtai District, Beijing
Guo Rong

My name is Guo Rong, and I am a farmer from Zhangguozhuang Township, Fengtai District. In February of this year, Gao Jun and I took the lead in merging four mutual aid teams in our village, absorbing several individual farmers, totaling thirty-four households, and organized an agricultural production cooperative. The entire cooperative has forty laborers, eight livestock, five new-style walking plows, three sprayers, one corn thresher, and more than 780 mu of land. Since we organized collective production, and with the use of the tractors donated by Czechoslovakian farmers to till the land, our crops have become the best-grown in the entire township.

Although this year's crops suffered some wind and flood damage, the harvest was still good. Corn and peanuts yielded more than 300 jin per mu, which is more than 20% higher than the average output of mutual aid teams in the township, and more than 40% higher than the average output of individual farmers. The output of sweet potatoes and millet was also higher than the township average. When farmers in the township mention the harvest, they say, "No one can compare to the agricultural production cooperative." The cooperative members themselves are also happy. Cooperative member Old Woman Hu said, "Look at how much grain we have harvested, the adults are happy to see it, and even the children are delighted."

After the crops were harvested, we held a meeting of cooperative members. After discussion, everyone unanimously agreed that, in addition to reserving enough food for the entire year for each household, in order to help the country's construction, all the surplus grain should be sold to the state.

This year's practical experience, especially the recent study of the state's general line, has made a truth clear to everyone in our township: we farmers, if we want to live a good life, must take the socialist road. Relying on hired labor, lending at usurious rates, deceiving and harming people, taking the capitalist road is inappropriate and will not work. Now, our country is heading towards the socialist goal, and we farmers must also attach our own carriages to the locomotive heading towards socialism. For farmers to move towards socialism, they must use new agricultural tools and new farming methods, and take the road of mutual aid and cooperation. This road can make everyone prosperous. Taking our own experience as an example, this year we organized ourselves, and with agricultural machinery, our entire cooperative had a bumper harvest. The income of the cooperative members has greatly increased compared to when they participated in the mutual aid team. Of the 34 households in the entire cooperative, 21 households have doubled their income, and some have even increased it by two or three times. The scene of the bumper harvest has made us farmers' hearts blossom with joy, and we have further realized that the road of mutual aid and cooperation is good! Everyone says, "This year is worth two years." At the same time, we have also more clearly recognized the benefits of national industrialization for farmers.

The cooperative members often talk about the benefits of the new agricultural tools made for us by the workers, such as new-style walking plows, weeding hoes, and insecticide equipment, which have played a significant role in helping us increase production and reduce natural disasters.

There is a cooperative member in our cooperative named Zhang You, who is not strong and often gets sick. In recent years, he has accumulated more than one million yuan in debt. After joining the cooperative, he was not clear about how great the benefits of participating in the cooperative were, and he was still frowning and worried about not being able to pay off his debt. But after the autumn harvest, when the dividends were distributed, he not only paid off his debt, but also had a surplus at home. Taking this example, Zhang You improved his life, which is certainly the result of participating in the agricultural production cooperative, but we must also thank the worker brothers, if the worker brothers had not supplied us with good and cheap new agricultural tools, how could we have had such a good harvest this year!

An old man who feeds livestock said after joining our cooperative: After doing farm work for decades, this year's income is the strongest. A few days ago, after selling the surplus grain and having money in hand, he bought a very beautiful khaki cotton coat. He said, "I have lived for more than sixty years and have never worn such good cloth. It feels great to wear it." I must also make this point clear here. Not only khaki cloth, but in fact, almost everything we farmers wear and use is made by workers. The tractors that we farmers need are all dependent on the workers to mass-produce after national industrialization. National industrialization is related to the most fundamental interests of farmers. Workers and farmers should hug each other tightly and unite together to form a solid alliance.

There is an individual farmer in our township named Liu Bingzheng. Recently, he sold all his surplus grain, both coarse and fine grains, to the state in one go. The reason is that he has family members working in the Changxindian factory. From this, he thought about the importance of the worker-peasant alliance. He was afraid that selling to private merchants would not guarantee food for the workers. In fact, it's not just Liu Bingzheng, how many people from our countryside go to work in factories! Speaking of origins, workers and farmers are the two pillars of the country, as close as brothers. The elder brother makes machines and produces industrial products, and the younger brother farms the land to supply grain and industrial raw materials. Neither can do without the other. To live a good life like the Soviet people, both the elder brother and the younger brother must not only work harder to produce, but also support each other. Therefore, for national industrialization, we sell all our surplus grain to the state.

We did not sell a single grain of our surplus to private merchants. We have dealt with private merchants for many years. They have always bought grain with heavy scales and sold grain with light scales. And that's not all. The most harmful thing is that every autumn, when the new grain comes down, private merchants lower the price as much as possible; and when there is a shortage of grain in the spring, they raise the price as much as possible, doing a "spring rise and autumn fall" every year, deliberately harming us farmers.

This time, when the cooperative discussed selling the surplus grain, everyone said: Grain is the "treasure of treasures." We only sell it to the state, not to private merchants, so as not to let them use the grain for speculation and profiteering to harm the people.

Speaking of the situation of our farmers selling surplus grain to the state, it is truly enthusiastic and exciting. The supply and marketing cooperative originally scheduled to start weighing at 1:00 p.m., but cooperative members Tong Qitai and Wang Deming pulled up carts early in the morning and ran to wait on the scales, carrying a bag on their shoulders; cooperative members Zhao Shuzhen and Wang Yi also came to me, asking me to help them calculate: how much should be left for the family to eat? How much should be sold to the state? Cooperative member Yang Qingtang wanted to sell 500 jin of surplus grain, but his wife disagreed. Yang Qingtang said, "You can stop me from taking the wrong path, but selling surplus grain to the state is beneficial to the country and the people, you can't stop me."

Our entire cooperative originally planned to sell 30,000 jin of surplus grain. Later, because everyone studied the general line and recognized the significance of selling surplus grain to support national industrial construction, after careful calculations by each household, the surplus grain sold exceeded this number, totaling more than 35,000 jin of grain.

When the farmers in our township saw our production cooperative selling grain in large carts and buying cloth and cotton in large rolls, they were extremely envious. These days, many farmers have come to request to join the cooperative. Now, many farmers in our township have taken a fancy to the road of mutual aid and cooperation, and all want to move forward along this road!

    为了国家社会主义工业化，我们把余粮全卖给了国家
    北京市农业劳动模范  北京丰台区张郭庄农业生产合作社主任
    郭荣
    我叫郭荣，是丰台区张郭庄乡的农民。今年二月，由我和高俊挑头，把我们村里头四个互助组合并到一起，吸收几个单干户，一共是三十四户，组织了一个农业生产合作社。全社有四十个劳动力，八头牲口，五部新式步犁，三台喷雾器，一部玉米脱粒机，七百八十多亩地。从我们组织起来集体生产，又加上使唤了捷克斯洛伐克农民赠送的拖拉机耕地，我们的庄稼就成了全乡长得最好的庄稼了。
    今年的庄稼虽说受些风灾、涝灾，可是收成还是不赖，玉米和花生每亩都收了三百多斤，比本乡互助组的平均产量高百分之二十多，比单干户的平均产量高百分之四十多，白薯和谷子的产量也比乡里产量高。乡里农民提起收成就说：“谁也比不了农业生产合作社”。社员们自己也高兴，社员扈老太太说：“瞧我们收这么多的粮食，大人看着喜欢，连小孩也乐。”
    庄稼收到家里后，我们召开了一次社员大会。经过讨论，大伙一致同意，每户除了留下明年全年的吃食以外，为了帮助国家建设，把全部的余粮，都卖给国家。
    今年这一年的实际经验，尤其是最近学习了国家总路线，使我们乡里都瞧清楚了一条真理，我们庄稼汉，要过好日子，就要走社会主义的道路，靠雇工，放高利贷，坑人害人，走资本主义的道路是不应当的，也是走不通的。现在，我们国家正在奔着社会主义的目标走，我们农民也要把自己的车厢，挂在往社会主义走的火车头上。农民往社会主义走，就要使用新式农具和新的耕作方法，走互助合作的道路。这条道使大伙全能富裕。就拿我们自己的经验来说，今年我们组织起来，又有了农业机器，我们全社庄稼就丰收了。社员的收入比参加互助组的时候都大大地增加了。全社三十四户，收入增加一倍的就有二十一户，甚至有增加了两、三倍的。丰收的光景，使我们这些庄稼汉们心里都乐开了花，更体会到互助合作的道儿好！都说：“今年一年能顶二年。”同时，也更认清了国家工业化对农民的好处。
    社员们常常念叨工人给我们造新式农具的好处，像新式步犁啦，耘锄啦，杀虫的药械啦，在帮助我们提高产量，减少自然灾害上，都起了很大的作用。
    我们社里有一个社员叫张有，身体不强，爱闹病，这几年，合起来欠下了一百多万元的债。入社以后，他闹不清参加合作社的好处有多大，仍然是愁眉苦脸的，成天发愁他这笔债还不清。可是秋收以后，分下红来，他不但还清了债，家里还有了剩余。拿这个例子来说，张有改善了生活，这固然是参加农业生产合作社的结果，可是也要感谢工人老大哥，要不是工人老大哥供给我们又好使又便宜的新式农具，我们那儿能有今年这么好的收成呵！
    有一个喂牲口的老头参加了我们的社以后，他自己说：做了几十年的庄稼活，收入数今年强。前些天，卖了余粮，手头有钱，他买了一套很漂亮的卡叽布的棉衣服。他说：“我活了六十多岁，从来没有穿过这样好的布，穿在身上倍亮。”我在这里，也得把这个道理说明白。不单是卡叽布，其实，我们农民穿的、用的差不多都是工人造的。我们农民需要的拖拉机，全指望着国家工业化以后，由工人大批的造。国家工业化关系着农民的最根本的利益。工人和农民应该抱得紧紧的，团结在一起，结成一个巩固的联盟。
    我们乡里有一个单干户叫刘秉正，最近，连粗粮带细粮，他一古脑儿地把余粮全卖给了国家。原因是他自己家里有人在长辛店工厂里当工人，他从这一点想到了工农联盟的重要性，他怕卖给私商，保证不了工人吃的。其实，不光是刘秉正，我们农村出去多少人在工厂里做活呵！说到归宗，工人和农民是国家的两根台柱子，跟亲兄弟一样亲，工人是老大，农民是老二。老大造机器，出工业品，老二种地供给粮食和工业原料，谁也离不了谁。要过像苏联人民一样的好日子，老大老二不但都要加劲生产，而且要彼此支援。因此，为了国家工业化，我们把余粮全卖给国家。
    我们的余粮一颗也没卖给私商。我们跟私商打过很多年的交道。他们买粮卖粮从来是大秤进，小秤出。这还不算，最坑人的是：一到秋天，新粮下来了，私商就把价钱压得低低的；等到春天缺粮的时候，他们又把价钱提得高高的，年年来它个“春涨秋落”，存心坑害我们农民。
    这次，社里头讨论卖余粮的时候，大伙都说：粮食是“宝中之宝”，咱们只卖给国家，不卖给私商，免得他们拿了粮食，投机倒把坑害人民。
    说起我们农民卖余粮给国家的情形，是真踊跃，真让人兴奋。供销合作社原订从下午一时起过秤，可是社员佟启泰、王德明在大清早就拉上了大车，肩膀上还扛了一口袋，跑去等着上秤；社员赵淑贞、王义还跑来找我，要我帮他算：家里吃该留多少？该卖给国家多少？社员杨庆堂要卖五百斤余粮，他的老婆不同意，杨庆堂说：“我不走好道你可以拦着，卖余粮给国家，是对国家对人民都有利的事，你可不能拦我。”
    我们全社原来计划要卖三万斤余粮，后来，因为大家学习了总路线，认识了卖余粮支援国家工业建设的意义，经过每户精打细算，卖的余粮又超出了这个数字，总共卖出来三万五千多斤粮食。
    我们乡里的农民看见我们生产合作社几大车几大车的卖粮食，几大卷几大卷地往回买布，买棉花，都羡慕的不得了。这些日子，那天都有很多农民跑来请求入社。现在，我们乡里的很多农民都看上了互助合作的道儿，全都要冲着这条道儿向前走哪！（北京人民广播电台广播稿摘要）（附图片）
