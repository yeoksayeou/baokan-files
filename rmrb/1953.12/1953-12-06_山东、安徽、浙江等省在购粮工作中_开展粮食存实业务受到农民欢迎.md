    Shandong, Anhui, Zhejiang and Other Provinces Carry Out Grain Deposit Business in Grain Purchase Work and Are Welcomed by Farmers

    State-owned grain departments in Shandong, Anhui, and Zhejiang provinces have been carrying out grain deposit business through cooperatives in the work of purchasing grain, which has been welcomed by farmers.

    The methods of grain deposit implemented in Shandong, Anhui, and Zhejiang generally stipulate that after farmers deposit grain in the cooperative, they can withdraw cash at any time, either in one lump sum or in batches. At the time of deposit, the price is determined according to the local prevailing purchase price and the grade of the grain, and the cooperative accepting the deposit issues a deposit receipt to the depositor. After the grain is deposited in the cooperative, the principal and value can be guaranteed. When withdrawing the deposit, the price will rise but not fall, but no interest will be calculated.

    The method of grain deposit conforms to the general savings habits of farmers, can save farmers who do not currently need money from the difficulty of storing grain themselves, and can eliminate the ideological concerns of a few farmers who are reluctant to sell at the current price. After the grain is deposited in the cooperative, cash can be withdrawn at any time, which is also very convenient for farmers. Therefore, the method of grain deposit is welcomed by the majority of farmers. For example, Xu Xiuxiang, a farmer from San Village, Yanmache Township, Jiangshan County, Zhejiang Province, praised the method of grain deposit, saying, "The method of deposit is really great. If the grain is kept at home, the mice will eat it, but it is very safe to deposit it in the cooperative!" Luo Genru, a farmer from Er Village, Mingshan Township, Yuyao County, said, "The People's Government has really thought of a thoughtful way for us! If the grain is stored at home, we sell a little at a time, wasting production effort; if we deposit it in the cooperative at one time, we can withdraw money as needed, saving a lot of effort!"

    After Shandong, Anhui, Zhejiang and other provinces carried out the grain deposit business, farmers have deposited grain in cooperatives. For example, in Jia Zhuang and Gu Zhuang in the sixth district of Liaocheng County, Shandong Province, farmers deposited more than 12,000 jin of grain in less than a day. In Chenhu District, Hudong County, Anhui Province, farmers quickly deposited 400,000 jin of rice. The Wang Zhoutong mutual aid group in Mingshan Township, Yuyao County, Zhejiang Province, deposited more than 70 percent of its surplus grain in the cooperative.

    When San Village, Yanmache Township, Jiangshan County, Zhejiang Province, carried out the grain deposit business, it carried out education on the general line of the state's transition period and patriotism among farmers, which had a very good effect. According to preliminary statistics on November 9, farmers in four natural villages, in addition to selling a large amount of surplus grain, deposited 38,600 jin of rice in the cooperative. However, some areas have not done a good job in publicizing the grain deposit business, so that some farmers still have ideological concerns such as "fear of showing off wealth," and the grain deposit business cannot be carried out well. Similar shortcomings should be overcome in various places. (Cheng Hua)

    山东、安徽、浙江等省在购粮工作中
    开展粮食存实业务受到农民欢迎
    山东、安徽、浙江等省国营粮食部门在收购粮食工作中，通过合作社办理粮食存实业务，受到农民欢迎。
    山东、安徽、浙江等省实行的粮食存实的办法，一般都规定：农民将粮食存入合作社后，可以随时提取现款，一次提取或分批提取均可。存入时，按当地当天的收购牌价及粮食的等级作价，由接受存实的合作社发给存户存实凭单。粮食存入合作社以后，可以保本保值，提取存实款项时，价格听涨不听落，但不计利息。
    粮食存实的办法，符合一般农民的储蓄习惯，可以使目前不要钱用的农民免除自己保管粮食的困难，并可消除少数农民的看价惜售的思想顾虑；粮食存入合作社后，可以随时提取现款，对于农民也很方便。因此，粮食存实的办法受到广大农民欢迎。如浙江省江山县严麻车乡三村农民徐秀香称赞粮食存实的办法说：“存实的办法真太好了，谷子放在家里，老鼠还要吃，存在合作社里顶保险！”余姚县明山乡二村农民罗根如说：“人民政府替我们想的办法真周到！谷子藏在家里，用一点卖一点，浪费生产工夫；一次存到合作社，随用随取钱，工夫省多啦！”
    山东、安徽、浙江等省开展粮食存实业务以后，农民们纷纷把粮食存入合作社。如山东省聊城县第六区的贾庄和谷庄，不到一天时间，就有农民存了一万二千多斤粮食。安徽省湖东县陈湖区一个区，农民很快就存了四十万斤稻谷。浙江省余姚县明山乡王周同互助组把百分之七十以上的余粮都存入了合作社。
    浙江省江山县严麻车乡三村在开展粮食存实业务时，向农民进行了国家过渡时期总路线和爱国主义的教育，效果很好。据十一月九日初步统计，四个自然村的农民除卖出大批余粮外，存入合作社的稻谷有三万八千六百斤。但是有的地区在开展粮食存实业务时，没有很好地进行宣传工作，以致有的农民还有“怕露富”等思想顾虑，粮食存实业务不能很好开展。类似缺点，各地应注意克服。（程华）
