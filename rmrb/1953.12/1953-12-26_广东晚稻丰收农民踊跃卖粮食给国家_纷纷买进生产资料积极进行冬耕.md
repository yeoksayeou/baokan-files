Guangdong Province overcame various natural disasters this year and achieved a bumper harvest of late rice. It is estimated that this year's late rice production will increase by more than 10% compared to last year; combined with the early rice harvest, the total increase is about 8%, an increase of about 1.4 billion jin of grain, completing the province's grain production increase task for this year. This is another significant victory for Guangdong Province this year following the victory of the land reform.

Guangdong's bumper harvest this year is different from previous years. High-yield records over large areas have appeared everywhere this year. For example, the 22,200 mu of sandy fields in Chenghai County increased late rice production by an average of 35% compared to last year, increasing rice production by 2.8 million jin. In Yuhu and Anle districts of Jieyang County, among 28 townships, 13 townships achieved an average yield of over 1,000 jin per mu. Chao'an County also saw 22 "thousand-jin townships" this year. The more than 2 million mu of sandy fields in the Pearl River Delta also generally increased production by more than 20%. Among them, many sandy fields that were submerged in water year-round and previously yielded only 30 to 50 jin per year have also achieved bumper harvests this year due to improved water conservancy. In the mountainous highland areas, this year's drought in June, which was rare in history, was overcome, and many mountain areas also achieved bumper harvests. For example, the 13th district of Chaoyang County is a mountainous area, and this year's production generally increased by 20%; Yanggongkeng Village in this district increased production by 50%. Last year, 20 out of the 53 households in the entire village did not have enough to eat. This year, except for 2 households that still lacked some rations, the rest had surplus grain to sell to the state.

In most of the areas where production increased, mutual aid teams achieved even greater yields. For example, the Du Jinhong mutual aid team in Panyu County, after being organized in December last year, improved labor efficiency by rationally using labor, cattle power, and farm tools. Transplanting and harvesting were both ten days earlier than local individual farmers. During the spring plowing, the fields were plowed three times and harrowed fourteen times. Both early and late rice used suitable seedling beds and more fertilizer, resulting in an average yield of 993 jin per mu this year, more than 300 jin more than the average local farmers. According to a survey in Yuancun Village, Yangmei Township, Jieyang County, among the 201 households in the village, the 64 households farming individually had an average late rice yield of 581 jin per mu, while the 137 households participating in mutual aid teams had an average late rice yield of 615 jin and 12 liang per mu. The fact that mutual aid teams can achieve greater yields shows the superiority of being organized, making many farmers deeply experience the benefits of being organized. According to statistics from 124 townships in Huiyang County, after the autumn harvest began this year, 2,146 temporary mutual aid teams were newly organized.

Recently, various parts of Guangdong have widely promoted the Party's general line during the transition period. About 150,000 rural cadres throughout the province participated in the study and enthusiastically took the lead in mobilizing the masses to sell surplus grain to the state. Party members, Youth League members, cadres, and mutual aid teams have formulated plans to sell grain to the state even before the autumn harvest is over. The Wang Hanguo mutual aid team in Jieyang County formulated a plan to sell 4,032 jin of grain. The Luo Shegen mutual aid team in Gangkou Township, Zhongshan County, was already planning to sell more than 11,000 jin of surplus grain from the entire team to the state during the autumn harvest. Fifteen cadres in Guo Township, Chao'an County, prepared to sell 19,000 jin of grain and made a plan to mobilize farmers throughout the township to sell 1 million jin of surplus grain. From November 26th to 29th, the East Guangdong region purchased more than 23.86 million jin of rice in four days; as of the end of November, the North Guangdong region had purchased more than 160 million jin of grain.

After selling surplus grain to the state, farmers in various places have been eagerly buying production materials, expanding production investment, and expanding the area of winter farming in order to produce more grain to support national industrial construction. For example, the Wu Liangen mutual aid team in Zhongshan County plans to strive for a minimum increase in yield to 950 jin per mu next year. Therefore, after selling 19,000 jin of surplus grain from the entire team to the state, they used the proceeds from 17,000 jin of grain to exchange for 4,550 jin of fertilizer, 500 jin of insecticide powder, two sprayers, and a batch of farm tools. After selling surplus grain, farmers in Gonghe Township, Qujiang County, many farmers bought draft cattle, or exchanged small cattle for large cattle. By mid-December, they had exchanged and newly purchased 60 large draft cattle. Farmers in Shanglian and other eight townships in Chaoyang County sold grain and exchanged it for winter farming seeds and fertilizer as soon as the autumn harvest ended, expanding the winter farming area by 20%. In order to produce more grain to support national industrial construction, many farmers are actively expanding the area of winter farming. As of November 24th, Luoding County had planted more than 159,000 mu of wheat, sweet potatoes, soybeans, and other crops. The early-planted wheat seedlings have grown to five or six inches tall. At present, the winter crops such as wheat and broad beans in northern and eastern Guangdong have basically been sown. It is estimated that the winter farming area in Guangdong Province this year can be expanded to more than 11 million mu, an increase of 20% compared to last year, and it is estimated that it can increase grain production by 400 million jin compared to last year.

    广东晚稻丰收农民踊跃卖粮食给国家
    纷纷买进生产资料积极进行冬耕
    广东省今年战胜了各种自然灾害，获得了晚稻丰收。估计今年晚稻比去年增产百分之十以上；连早稻收成合计约增产百分之八左右，共约增产粮食十四亿市斤，完成了今年全省粮食增产任务。这是广东省今年接着土地改革胜利后，又一个重大的胜利。
    广东今年丰收与往年不同。今年到处出现大面积的高额丰产纪录，如澄海县二万二千亩沙田，今年晚稻平均比去年增产百分之三十五，增产稻谷二百八十万斤，揭阳县渔湖、安乐两个区二十八个乡中，出现了十三个乡每亩平均产量达一千斤以上。潮安县今年也出现了二十二个千斤乡。在珠江三角洲上的二百多万亩沙田，也普遍增产两成以上，其中许多原是长年浸水，过去年产三、五十斤的沙田，今年由于修好了水利，也获得了丰收。在山区高田地带，今年战胜了历年少有的六月旱，许多山地同样获得了丰收，如潮阳县十三区是山区，今年普遍增产两成；该区洋功坑村则增产五成，去年全村五十三户有二十户不够吃，今年除了二户还缺一部分口粮外，其他都有余粮卖给国家。
    在绝大部分增产的地区中，互助组都得到更大的产量，如番禺县杜金洪互助组，去年十二月组织起来后，由于合理使用劳动力、牛力和农具，提高了劳动效率，插秧、割禾都比当地单干农户提早十天，春耕时犁田三次，耙田十四次，早稻、晚稻都采用了合式秧田，并多下了肥料，因而使今年每亩平均产量高达九百九十三斤，比当地一般农民增产三百多斤。据揭阳县阳美乡远村调查，该村二百零
  一户中，单干的六十四户晚稻平均每亩产量五百八十一斤，参加互助组的一百三十七户，晚稻平均每亩产量则高达六百一十五斤十二两。互助组能有更大产量的事实，显示了组织起来的优越性，使许多农民深深体验到组织起来的好处。据惠阳县一百二十四个乡的统计，今年秋收开始后，新组织起来的就有二千一百四十六个临时互助组。
    最近广东各地广泛地宣传党在过渡时期的总路线，全省约有十五万乡村干部参加了学习，并踊跃带头发动群众把余粮卖给国家。各地党员、团员、干部、互助组，当秋收还未结束就纷纷订出售粮给国家的计划，揭阳县汪汉国互助组订出了售粮四千零三十二斤的计划。中山县港口乡罗社根互助组还在秋收中就盘算着把全组余粮一万一千多斤卖给国家。潮安县郭乡十五个干部准备卖粮一万九千斤，并作了动员全乡农民出售余粮一百万斤的计划。粤东区由十一月二十六日到二十九日，四天内全区收购大米二千三百八十六万多斤；粤北区截至十一月底止全区已收购粮食一亿六千多万斤。
    各地农民把余粮卖给国家后，为了增产更多的粮食支援国家工业建设，都纷纷买进生产资料，扩大生产投资，扩大冬耕面积。如中山县吴连根互助组，计划争取明年每亩田最低增产到九百五十斤。因此把全组余粮一万九千斤卖给国家后，以一万七千斤谷子的款项换回肥料四千五百五十斤、杀虫药粉五百斤、喷雾器两个和一批农具。曲江县共和乡农民售出余粮后，许多农民买了耕牛，或以小牛换回大牛，到十二月中旬已换进和新买了六十头大耕牛。潮阳县上练等八个乡农民秋收刚结束，即卖粮换回冬耕种籽、肥料，扩大了冬耕面积百分之二十。许多农民为了增产更多的粮食，支持国家工业建设，都积极扩大冬耕面积；到十一月二十四日止罗定县已种下小麦、番薯、黄豆等作物十五万九千多亩。种得早的麦苗已长五、六寸高。目前粤北、粤东等地小麦、蚕豆等冬季作物已基本播种完毕，估计今年广东省冬耕面积可扩大到一千一百万亩以上，比去年扩大了百分之二十，估计可以比去年增产四亿斤粮食。　（艾玲、吴尔祥）
