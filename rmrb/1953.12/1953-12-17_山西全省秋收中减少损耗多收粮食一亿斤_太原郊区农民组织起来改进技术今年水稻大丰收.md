Farmers in Shanxi Province, during this year's autumn harvest, implemented the spirit of increasing production and saving grain, harvesting and threshing carefully to minimize losses. It is estimated that the province can gain an extra 100 million jin of grain and over 3 million jin of cotton. In Lingchuan County, 89 townships gained an extra 87,000+ jin of grain; in Yuci County, over 1.5 million jin. In Sunjiagou in Lin County, Naisheng in Changzhi, Dongdeng in Xiangling, etc., stalks were milled three times, gaining an extra 24,000+ jin of grain, or an extra 4.5 liang per mu. In Zuoyun County, timely processing of waterlogged yams reduced losses by over 3.84 million jin. In Shuo County, more than 2,000 women and children were mobilized, and in less than ten days, they collected over 370,000 jin of yam tubers. Many cotton fields, through promoting early maturity, careful harvesting, and picking, not only increased yields but also improved quality. In Xizhanggeng Township in Xie County, with a total of over 5,900 mu of cotton fields, careful harvesting and picking resulted in an extra yield of over 17,700 jin of cotton. (Guo Shi)

The rice crop in the suburbs of Taiyuan City achieved an overall bumper harvest this year. The average rice yield in the entire suburban area was 690 jin per mu, exceeding the average yield in 1950 (300 jin) by 390 jin, and exceeding the average yield in 1952 by 59 jin. In Jinci area, the production site of the famous Shanxi "Jinci Rice", the average yield per mu was 832 jin. In Xiaozhan Village, Sixth District of Taiyuan City, with a total of over 568.9 mu of rice paddies, the average yield per mu was 1,006 jin. The bumper rice harvest in the suburbs of Taiyuan City this year was mainly due to the fact that the People's Government helped farmers to gradually organize, and universally promoted superior varieties and advanced cultivation techniques. The farmers in Xiaozhan Village felt that they had to organize in terms of planting rice and purchasing rice threshing machines. In 1951, there was not a single mutual aid team, but now there are eight mutual aid teams. The farmers in these eight teams account for 71.6% of the farmers in the village. This year, the rice paddies of seven teams, totaling 389 mu, all yielded over 1,000 jin. In the Jinci area, only 8% of the land used local varieties this year, while the rest used the superior Luyu variety. This variety has large and dense ears, and the grains do not easily fall off. The average yield per mu on land using the Luyu variety in the Jinci area was 876 jin, with the highest reaching over 1,350 jin; while the average yield per mu on land using local varieties was only over 300 jin, with the highest reaching only 600 jin. In addition, appropriate close planting, rational phased fertilization, careful cultivation, mastering seasonal irrigation and drainage, and rapid elimination of pests were also important reasons for this year's increased production. This year, there was a serious lodging phenomenon in the local rice crop in the later stages. If this phenomenon could be prevented, there would be more production. The main reason for lodging is too much nitrogen fertilizer and too little potash fertilizer (grass ash, compost, etc.). At present, the Taiyuan City Agricultural Technology Extension Station is helping farmers solve this problem, and has mobilized the Ligenzhu Agricultural Production Cooperative to formulate a plan for accumulating 40,000 jin of fertilizer in winter, driving the majority of farmers to carry out a winter fertilizer accumulation campaign to make up for the lack of potash fertilizer next year.

    山西全省秋收中减少损耗多收粮食一亿斤
    太原郊区农民组织起来改进技术今年水稻大丰收
    山西省农民今年秋收中，贯彻了增产节约粮食的精神，细收细打，尽量减少损耗，估计全省可多收粮食一亿斤左右，棉花三百多万斤。陵川县八十九个乡多收粮食八万七千多斤，榆次县多收一百五十多万斤。临县孙家沟、长治内生、襄陵东邓等乡，碾了三遍秸秆，多收粮食两万四千多斤，每亩多收了四斤十两。左云县及时处理被水泡烂的山药，减少损失三百八十四万多斤。朔县七个区发动妇女儿童两千多人，不到十天就拾山药蛋三十七万多斤。许多棉田，经过促进早熟，细收细摘，不但产量提高，质量也提高了。解县西张耿乡共有棉田五千九百多亩，经过细收细摘，多收棉花一万七千七百多斤。（郭石）
    太原市郊区水稻，今年获得全面丰收。全郊区的水稻产量平均每亩为六百九十斤，超过一九五○年平均产量（三百斤）三百九十斤，超过一九五二年平均产量五十九斤。山西著名的“晋祠大米”产地晋祠一带，每亩平均产量为八百三十二斤，太原市郊第六区的小站村，共种稻田五百六十八亩九分多，每亩平均产量一千零六斤。太原市郊区水稻今年获得丰收，主要是因为人民政府帮助农民逐步组织起来，普遍推广了优良品种和先进耕作技术。小站村农民在栽植水稻和购买打稻机器方面，都感到非组织起来不可，一九五一年还没有一个互助组，现在已经有了八个互助组了。这八个组的农户，占全村农户的百分之七十一点六，今年有七个组的稻田三百八十九亩地，产量都在千斤以上。晋祠一带今年用当地品种的地只有百分之八，其他都选用了陆羽优良品种。这种品种穗大紧密，不易脱粒。晋祠一带选用陆羽品种的地，每亩平均产量八百七十六斤，最高的达到一千三百五十多斤；而选用当地品种的地，每亩平均只产到三百多斤，最高的才达到六百斤。此外，适当密植，合理分期施肥，精耕细作，掌握季节灌溉排水，及迅速扑灭虫害等，都是当地今年增产的重要原因。今年当地水稻在后期发生严重的倒伏现象，如果能够防止这一现象的发生，增产就会更多。倒伏的主要原因，是施氮肥太多，钾质肥料（草木灰，堆肥等）太少。现在太原市农业技术推广站正帮助农民解决这一问题，发动李根柱农业生产合作社，订立冬季积肥四万斤的计划，带动广大农民开展冬季积肥运动，以补明年钾质肥料的不足。
