    Northeast state-owned factories and mines are actively preparing for next year's production tasks in order to meet the production tasks of the second year of the Five-Year Plan.
    At present, state-owned steel, power, coal, machinery, non-ferrous metals, building materials, and textile systems factories and mines have completed the 1954 production plan, and some factories and mines have already prepared the production plan for the first quarter of next year. Many machinery factories have stockpiled an appropriate amount of materials and semi-finished products to ensure the normal progress of production. The state-owned power industry sector has formulated an equipment overhaul plan for the first quarter of 1954 to ensure safe power supply.
    This year, most factories and mines attach great importance to production preparations for next year. The Northeast Electric Power Administration, in response to the past shortcomings of dispersed use of overhaul and safety maintenance project funds, has formulated measures for prioritized use, and has carried out pole inspections, anti-corrosion work, or pile driving to prevent wind and lightning accidents. Since the coal mine administration held a tunneling meeting in September, it has reversed the tendency to only focus on coal mining and neglect tunneling. By the end of the year, it will not only be able to make up for the number of meters of tunneling owed in the first half of the year, but it is expected to exceed it by 5%, creating favorable conditions for expanding reproduction in the coming year. The mixed materials required for expanding the production of blended cement by various cement plants next year have been basically resolved. The machinery factories have also paid attention to the normal reserve of re-manufactured products next year. The Industry Department of the Northeast Financial and Economic Committee is organizing the region's only seven herringbone gear planers to process important parts for key equipment for various enterprises, in order to fundamentally solve the problem of safe mechanical operation. The paper industry is vigorously organizing the supply of slabs, waste paper, waste hemp, etc. to ensure the expansion of waste material utilization in the coming year. The rubber industry factories are promoting the advanced experience of "technical conditions" to strengthen technical management, in order to consolidate the quality of tire and rubber shoe products; new products such as acid-resistant clothing and raincoats have also been successfully trial-produced. Through production and sales meetings, pharmaceutical factories have determined the production tasks of ampoules, tablets, gauze, cotton wool, etc., and signed production and sales contracts for next year. The textile industry system has been piloting the 1953 maintenance work method in Jinzhou and Wafangdian textile factories since August, and has held training courses to train a large number of cadres.

    东北国营厂矿加紧准备迎接明年生产任务
    迎接五年计划第二年的生产任务，东北各国营厂、矿正在积极进行各项准备工作。
    目前，国营钢铁、电力、煤矿、机械、有色金属、建筑材料和纺织等系统厂矿，已经编好一九五四年的产量计划，若干厂、矿已经编制出明年第一季度的生产计划。许多机械工厂已储备了适当数量的材料和半成品，以便保证生产的正常进行。国营电力工业部门为保证安全供电，已订出了一九五四年第一季度的设备检修计划。
    今年多数厂、矿对明年的生产准备工作很重视。东北电业管理局针对过去检修及安全维护工程费用使用分散的缺点，已订出重点使用的措施，并进行了线杆检查、防腐或打绑桩的工作，以防止发生风害、雷害事故。煤矿管理局自九月份召开掘进会议以后，扭转了只重视采煤轻视掘进的偏向，到年末，不但可以补上上半年欠掘公尺数，预计还能超过百分之五，给来年扩大再生产创造了有利条件。各水泥厂明年扩大混合水泥生产所需的混合材料基本上获得解决。机械各厂也注意了明年再制品的正常储备。东北财政经济委员会工业处正在组织全区仅有的七台人字牙轮刨为各企业加工关键设备重要部件，以期从根本上解决机械安全运转的问题。造纸工业正在大力组织板皮、废纸、废麻等供应，以保证来年扩大废料的利用。橡胶工业各厂正在推行“技术条件”这一加强技术管理的先进经验，以巩固轮胎胶鞋产品的质量；耐酸衣、雨衣等新产品也试制成功了。制药各厂通过产销会议确定了安瓶、片剂、纱布、药棉等生产任务，并签订了明年产销合同。纺织工业系统，自今年八月起，在金州、瓦房店纺织厂进行了一九五三年保全工作法的试点，并举办训练班，培养了大批干部。
