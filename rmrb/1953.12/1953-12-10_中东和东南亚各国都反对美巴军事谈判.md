Xinhua News Agency, December 9th: The United States' conspiracy to instigate a military alliance with Pakistan continues to face strong opposition from Middle Eastern countries.

While US Vice President Nixon was "visiting" Afghanistan, the Associated Press reported that Afghan Prime Minister Sardar Mohammed Daoud told reporters on the 6th that "Afghanistan strongly opposes the rumored proposal to establish US military bases in Pakistan." "He said when meeting with reporters: Afghanistan cannot have very friendly thoughts about this proposal."

Daoud specifically pointed out that Afghanistan and Pakistan are currently in dispute over the status of the Batan tribes in Bakhtunistan on their border. Daoud said that Afghanistan is very concerned that the United States may give full and close attention to the affairs of one side in this dispute. It is very clear that Afghanistan is very worried about the United States' trick of habitually creating disputes between other countries as a pretext for intervention and aggression.

The Kabul "Friendship News" warned in a commentary: "If the United States supplies Pakistan with weapons and military equipment, Afghanistan will regard this as an unfriendly act towards Afghanistan's interests." "We believe that the conclusion of this treaty is a threat to peace and tranquility in the world, especially in Asia."

The leader of the Iraqi National Democratic Party, Chadaki, delivered a speech at the party's recent annual meeting, saying that the United States' so-called "Middle East Defense Plan" "has been rejected by all Arab countries without exception." The United States is attempting to "rely on Pakistan and Turkey to force Arab countries to accept that plan. The Arab people will continue to strongly oppose this imperialist conspiracy." They "hope to avoid being drawn into conspiracies that drag them into war." Chadaki pointed out that the United States' "Middle East Defense Plan" "is very harmful to the interests of the Arabs and detrimental to their integrity and future."

Xinhua News Agency, December 9th: New Delhi News: Indian, Ceylon, and Indonesian public opinion continues to denounce the US-Pakistan military alliance negotiations as a threat to Asian peace and the unity and security of India and Pakistan.

According to the "Delhi Times" weekly, the president of the Asian Brotherhood Association of India, Mauriana Taji Mohammed Khalil, told reporters that US military bases in Pakistan would be a constant threat to peace in Asia.

The weekly also published an open letter from Indian Member of Parliament Brajeshwar Prasad to Indian Prime Minister Nehru. Prasad said in the letter that the United States' plan to establish bases on Pakistani territory is a serious threat to the unity and freedom of both India and Pakistan. The establishment of US bases in Pakistan is the beginning of a carefully planned offensive by the United States against India.

According to the "Indian Express", the resolution passed by the executive committee of the Hindu Conference stated that if Pakistan and the United States conclude a military treaty, the Indian government will regard it as a hostile and aggressive act.

A senior Ceylonese official commented in Colombo on the US-Pakistan military alliance negotiations on the 7th, saying that if these reports are correct, it portends a "serious danger" to India's situation. He said: "It is nonsense to say that the weapons supplied by the United States to Pakistan will not be used in Kashmir. These weapons and fighter jets will certainly be used." The senior Ceylonese official continued: "Any dispute between India and Pakistan is their own business, and the United States should not participate. It is improper for a third party to sneak into Pakistan to take advantage of its differences with India." He warned that any military combination between the United States and Pakistan could lead to Pakistan being engulfed.

Ceylon's Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives, Bandaranaike, said when describing US military aid that US military aid would quadruple Pakistan's army, totaling one million people. He said that if this is true, most Southeast Asian countries will have to reconsider their attitudes in terms of foreign policy and defense.

In Indonesia, the important Jakarta newspaper "Indonesian News" commented on the US-Pakistan military alliance: "The fate of some countries that have already become victims of American power politics, especially those in Western Europe and North Africa, as well as Iran, etc., is miserable. It is regrettable that the United States has not noticed the fact that the entire people of the Middle East, the majority of the people of Western Europe, and the united progressive forces of Southeast Asian countries have been and still are anti-American."

"In order to carry out this crazy activity, it disregarded the long-standing dispute between India and Pakistan, and actually created riots and great panic in Pakistan, which is close to India." The newspaper fears that Pakistan may become a victim of "the current American high-pressure, philistine-like strategy."

Jakarta's "Political Weekly" said in a commentary: "Pakistani leaders should clearly remember that those who are trying to undermine the national sovereignty of Southeast Asian countries today will be the beneficiaries of this treaty. Therefore, Pakistan's participation in such an alliance will cause great damage to the cause of Asia."

Bandung's "People's Opinion" also strongly criticized US Secretary of State Dulles's "conspiracy to seduce Pakistan into concluding a military alliance with the United States."

    中东和东南亚各国都反对美巴军事谈判
    【新华社九日讯】美国策动与巴基斯坦缔结军事同盟的阴谋，继续遭到中东国家的强烈反对。
    正当美国副总统尼克松“访问”阿富汗的时候，据美联社报道：阿富汗首相萨达尔·穆罕默德·达乌德六日在接见记者时“明白表示，阿富汗强烈反对传闻中的在巴基斯坦建立美国军事基地的建议。”“他在接见记者时说：阿富汗对于这个建议不能抱着很友好的想法。”
    达乌德特别指出：阿富汗和巴基斯坦两国之间正在两国边界巴克童尼斯坦的巴丹部落的地位问题上发生争执。达乌德说：阿富汗很担心美国可能对于这个争执中的一方的事务给予充分而密切的注意。很明显，阿富汗对于美国惯于在其他国家之间制造纠纷、从而作为进行干涉和侵略的藉口的伎俩，是十分担心的。
    阿富汗首都喀布尔“友谊报”在评论中警告说：“如果美国以武器和军事设备供给巴基斯坦，阿富汗将认为这是对阿富汗利益的不友好行为。”“我们认为这个条约的缔结是对全世界特别是对亚洲的和平与安宁的威胁。”
    伊拉克国家民主党领袖查大基在该党最近举行的年会上发表演讲说：美国的所谓“中东防御计划”“已被所有阿拉伯国家毫无例外地拒绝”。美国企图“依靠巴基斯坦和土耳其来强迫阿拉伯国家接受那个计划。阿拉伯人民将继续强烈反对这种帝国主义的阴谋。”他们“希望避免卷入把他们拖进战争的阴谋里”。查大基指出：美国的“中东防御计划”“对阿拉伯的利益非常有害，而且对于他们的完整和前途都有不利的影响”。
    【新华社九日讯】新德里消息：印度、锡兰和印尼舆论继续斥责美巴军事同盟谈判威胁亚洲和平和印巴两国的团结和安全。
    据“德里时代”周刊报道，印度的亚洲兄弟协会主席毛利安纳·塔吉·穆罕默德·哈利尔向记者说：美国在巴基斯坦的军事基地将是对亚洲和平的
  一个经常的威胁。
    该周刊还刊载了印度国会议员布拉杰斯瓦尔·普拉沙德给印度总理尼赫鲁的一封公开信。普拉沙德在信中说：美国打算在巴基斯坦领土上建立基地的计划，是对印度和巴基斯坦两国的团结和自由的严重威胁。美国在巴基斯坦建立基地，是美国对印度计划周密的攻势的开端。
    据“印度快报”报道，印度教大会执行委员会通过的决议说：如果巴基斯坦和美国缔结军事条约，印度政府将把它看作是敌对的和侵略的行为。
    锡兰高级官员七日在科伦坡评论美巴军事同盟谈判时说：如果这些报道是正确的话，就预示着印度处境的“严重的危险”。他说：“要说美国供给巴基斯坦的武器不会用在克什米尔，那是无稽之谈。这些武器和战斗机当然会用上的。”这位锡兰高级官员接着说：“印巴之间的任何争执是它们自己的事，美国不应参与。第三者潜入巴基斯坦以利用它与印度的分歧，这是不正当的。”他警告说：任何美巴之间的军事结合，都有使巴基斯坦被吞没的可能性。
    锡兰众议院反对派领袖班达拉纳克在叙述美国军事援助时说：美国的军事援助将使巴基斯坦军队增加四倍，总共达一百万人。他说：假如这是事实，东南亚大多数国家将必须重新考虑它们在外交政策和国防方面的态度。
    在印尼，雅加达的重要报纸“印尼新闻报”评论美巴军事同盟说：“某些已经沦为美国强权政治的牺牲品的国家，尤其是那些西欧和北非的国家以及伊朗等，它们的命运是悲惨的。令人遗憾的是，美国丝毫没有注意到这样的事实：中东的全体人民、西欧的大多数人民以及东南亚各国的团结一致的进步力量，过去一直是、现在仍然是反美的。”
  “美国为了进行这种疯狂的活动，它不顾印、巴之间长期存在的争执，竟在印度的紧邻巴基斯坦制造骚乱和极大的惊慌。”该报担心巴基斯坦可能成为
  “目前美国高压的市侩似的战略”的牺牲者。
    雅加达“政治周刊”在评论中说：“巴基斯坦的领袖们应清楚地记住，那些在今天企图破坏东南亚国家的国家主权的人，将是这一条约中的受惠者。因此，巴基斯坦参加这种同盟将使亚洲的事业遭受很大的损害。”
    万隆的“人民舆论报”也强烈抨击美国国务卿杜勒斯的“勾引巴基斯坦和美国订立军事同盟的阴谋”。
