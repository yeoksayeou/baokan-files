Partial Successes Achieved by Disaster-Stricken Masses in Liaoxi Province Through Production for Self-Relief

    Thanks to the in-depth leadership of cadres, disaster-stricken areas in Liaoxi Province that suffered from floods this year have achieved successes in production for self-relief.

    After the disaster relief work conference in Liaoxi Province, responsible comrades from the Provincial Party Committee, the Provincial Government, cooperatives, banks, and other departments went deep into the disaster areas to conduct investigations and research, and to promote disaster relief work. Under the unified leadership of the Party committees at all levels, the relevant departments in various regions clarified their responsibilities and worked together, thereby rapidly launching production for self-relief. According to incomplete statistics, income from household-based sideline occupations alone reached over ten billion yuan. In leading production for self-relief, Liaoxi Province paid more attention to strengthening the education of township and village cadres, and giving full play to the role of the Party and government grassroots organizations. For example, under the leadership of the Party branch in Sandao Gou Village, Tai’an County, village cadres participated in various production organizations to lead production by participating in production. This led to a fervent production campaign, with over 70% of the village's labor force participating in production. By mid-October, the village had already earned over 80 million yuan, thereby resolving the livelihood difficulties of Party members and cadres. Disaster areas with better-developed sideline production all received strong support from various departments, especially from cooperatives, which promptly resolved difficulties in supply, marketing, and technology. For example, the four grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in the tenth district of Xinmin County, under the leadership of the district Party committee, formed a "joint operation and joint sales" team and signed supply and marketing contracts with the disaster-stricken people. This not only strengthened the planning of sideline production but also saved manpower and material resources, expanded sales, and increased the income of the disaster-stricken people. The second district had a weaker foundation for sideline production, but under the leadership of the district Party committee, a "Sideline Technology Guidance Station" was established, mainly by the supply and marketing cooperative, enabling the disaster-stricken masses to learn sideline techniques and engage in production for overcoming the famine.

    辽西省部分受灾群众生产自救获得成绩
    辽西省今年部分遭受水灾的地区，由于干部深入领导，灾区群众的生产救灾工作已获得成绩。
    辽西省在救灾工作会议以后，省委、省府、合作社、银行等部门都有负责同志深入灾区，调查研究和推动救灾工作，各地有关部门在党委统一领导下，明确分工，协同动作，因而生产救灾工作迅速展开。据不完全统计，只家庭编织类的副业收入，即达百余亿元。辽西省在领导生产救灾工作中，更注意了加强对乡、村干部的教育，充分发挥了党、政基层组织的作用。如台安县三道沟村在党支部领导下，村干部都分头参加到各生产组织中去，以参加生产来领导生产，使生产运动热烈展开，全村百分之七十以上的劳动力都参加了生产，该村在十月中旬即已收入八千多万元。因而党、团员和干部的生活困难也得到解决。副业生产开展较好的灾区，都是得到了各部门的大力支持，特别是合作社的支持，及时地解决了供销和技术上的困难。如新民十区的四个基层供销社，在区委领导下组成了“联营联销”小组，与灾民订立供销合同，这不但加强了副业生产的计划性，而且节省了人力、物力，扩大供销额，增加了灾民收入。二区的副业基础较差，但在区委领导下，以供销社为主建立了一处“副业技术指导站”，也使受灾群众学会副业技术，进行生产渡荒。（梁琮）
