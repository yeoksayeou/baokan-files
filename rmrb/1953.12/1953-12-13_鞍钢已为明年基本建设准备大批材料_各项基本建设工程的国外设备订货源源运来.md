    Anshan Iron and Steel Already Preparing Large Quantities of Materials for Next Year's Capital Construction; Foreign Equipment Orders for Various Capital Construction Projects Arrive Continuously

    The capital construction department of Anshan Iron and Steel is stepping up preparations for the supply of capital construction materials for 1954. Currently, it has prepared a large quantity of major materials for capital construction in the first quarter of next year, and foreign equipment orders are arriving continuously. The prepared timber accounts for 31% of the total annual requirement; red bricks account for 18% of the total annual requirement; cement accounts for 32.7% of the total annual requirement; and there are already more than 5,800 tons of steel. The reserve quantities of these major materials include those in storage and those being balanced upon application, with some currently in transit. Timber needed for the first quarter of next year is being processed in large quantities.

    Foreign equipment orders for various capital construction projects in 1954 have been arriving continuously from fraternal countries such as the Soviet Union, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic. Except for instruments, weighing cars, and some electrical equipment, all the equipment required for the first quarter of next year has been shipped to Anshan. As of now, most of the mechanical equipment for the steelmaking system has arrived; for the ironmaking system (No. 6 blast furnace), all equipment except for instruments and weighing cars has arrived, and an agreement has been reached with the Soviet Union for equipment orders for the No. 5 blast furnace; most of the major equipment for the ore dressing and refractory system has been shipped to Anshan; approximately 35% of the equipment for the coking system has arrived, with the remaining portion to be delivered before the end of the year according to the contract. In addition, dump trucks, mobile belt conveyors, bulldozers, truck cranes, and other construction equipment have also arrived.

      The preparation work for the supply of foreign equipment for 1954 was completed more than forty days earlier than last year. This is of great significance for timely supply of equipment and ensuring the progress of construction.

    鞍钢已为明年基本建设准备大批材料
    各项基本建设工程的国外设备订货源源运来
    鞍钢基本建设部门正加紧进行一九五四年基本建设供应的准备工作，目前已为明年第一季度基本建设准备了大量主要材料，国外设备订货也源源运来。已准备的木材为全年需用量的百分之三十一；红砖为全年需用量的百分之十八；水泥为全年需用量的百分之三十二点七；钢材已有五千八百多吨。这些主要材料的储备数量包括在库与申请平衡的，一部分正在运输中。明年第一季度需用的木材正在大量加工。
    一九五四年度各项基本建设工程的国外设备订货，已由苏联、匈牙利、波兰、捷克、民主德国等兄弟国家源源运来。明年第一季度所需设备，除计器、称量车和部分电气设备外，已全部运到鞍山。截至目前为止，炼钢系统的机械设备大部到齐；炼铁系统（六号高炉）的设备，除计器和称量车外，已全部到达，五号高炉的设备订货已与苏联达成协议；选矿耐火系统的重大设备已大部运抵鞍山；焦化系统的设备已到百分之三十五左右，其余部分按合同规定年前交货。此外，到货的还有翻斗车、移动式皮带运输机、推土机、汽车吊等施工设备。
      一九五四年度国外设备供应的准备工作，较去年提前四十多天。这对及时供应设备，保证施工进度，具有重大意义。
