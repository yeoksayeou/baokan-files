    CCP Shanxi Provincial Committee Dispatches Large Number of Cadres to Form Inspection Teams, Dividing into Thirty-Two Counties to Promote the National General Line and Advance Winter Production Work
    The CCP Shanxi Provincial Committee recently extracted more than 670 cadres from various provincial-level organs to form inspection teams. On the 16th of this month, they departed for thirty-two counties in the six special districts of Yuci, Linfen, Yuncheng, Changzhi, Xinzhou, and Yanbei to promote the national general line and conduct in-depth inspections and promotion of rural winter production work.
    The inspection team is personally led by Comrades Wei Heng, Lü Hong'an, and Zheng Lin of the Provincial Party Committee. Before their departure, they spent a week studying the Party's general line during the transition period. During the study, they listened to Comrade Wei Heng's report on the "General Line and General Tasks of the Party During the Transition Period," Comrade Pei Lisheng, Second Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, on the report on rural winter work, and Comrade Liu Kaiji, Deputy Director of the Provincial Party Committee's Rural Work Department, conveyed the spirit of the Party Central Committee's Conference on Mutual Aid and Cooperation in Rural Areas. During the study and discussion, everyone raised many specific questions, which Comrade Pei Lisheng answered. After seven days of intensive study, the inspection team cadres all clearly understood the basic spirit of the national general line and general tasks during the transition period.
    Before the inspection team departed, Comrade Tao Lujia, First Secretary of the CCP Shanxi Provincial Committee, gave important instructions to all the cadres going to the countryside. Comrade Tao Lujia first clearly pointed out that the inspection team must simultaneously complete and do a good job of two tasks: namely, the work of material exchange centered on the purchase of grain, and the rural winter production work centered on consolidating and developing agricultural producers' cooperatives. He emphasized that these two tasks are two aspects of the Party's socialist transformation of agriculture. If both aspects of the work are done well, the socialist transformation of agriculture can be steadily realized, and preparations can be made for expanded reproduction next year. Therefore, these two tasks must and can be combined and carried out simultaneously, and cannot be neglected. Then, Tao Lujia criticized the incorrect attitude of some comrades. They verbally supported the Party's general line, but when they encountered specific policy issues and practical work issues, their ideological viewpoints often deviated from the Party's general line. For example: Who benefits from national industrialization? Who benefits from the state's purchase of grain? What kind of person can be regarded as a grain speculator? Some comrades often drew wrong conclusions on these issues. The reason is mainly because they did not conduct a specific analysis of specific problems based on the spirit of the Party's general line during the transition period.
    Regarding how to do these two tasks well, Tao Lujia pointed out: First of all, it is necessary to do a good job of political and ideological mobilization from top to bottom and from inside to outside. Vigorously publicize the general line and general tasks to the peasants, and carry out a struggle against the influence of bourgeois ideology within the Party. The most effective way to publicize the general line and general tasks is to clarify the relationship between the state and the individual, the relationship between the city and the countryside, and the relationship between the present and the future through typical examples and accounting comparisons, so as to draw a clear line between the socialist road and the capitalist road. Second, we must comprehensively and correctly implement the Party's various policies. In the implementation of policies, we must carry out a two-front struggle against "rightism" and prevent "leftism." For the vast number of middle peasants, we must adhere to the principle of combining political work with economic work, and we must adhere to the method of persuasion and education. Of course, necessary criticism must also be carried out against the spontaneous capitalist tendencies among a small number of middle peasants. On the other hand, it is also necessary to strictly distinguish between grain speculators and ordinary peasants who have slightly speculative behavior. It is absolutely forbidden to randomly label people with "hats," so as not to affect the unity of the peasants. Third, strong and capable cadres must be sent to take charge of districts and townships where work is lagging behind. Fourth, it is necessary to strengthen leadership, strengthen inspection, seize the time, promote a fighting style, oppose a procrastinating and laissez-faire style, and establish a regular reporting system.

    中共山西省委抽调大批干部组成检查团分赴三十二县
    宣传国家总路线推动冬季生产工作
    中共山西省委最近从省级各机关抽调出六百七十余名干部，组成检查团，于本月十六日分赴榆次、临汾、运城、长治、忻县和雁北六个专区的三十二个县进行国家总路线的宣传，并深入检查和推动农村冬季生产工作。
    该检查团由省委卫恒、吕鸿安、郑林等同志亲自领导，在出发之前，曾以一星期的时间，学习了党在过渡时期的总路线。在学习中，听了卫恒同志关于“党在过渡时期总路线总任务”的传达，省委第二书记裴丽生同志关于农村冬季工作的报告，并由省委农村工作部刘开基副部长传达了党中央农村互助合作会议的精神。在学习和讨论中，大家提出了许多具体问题，由裴丽生同志作了解答。经过七天的紧张学习，检查团干部都明确认识了过渡时期的国家总路线总任务的基本精神。
    检查团临行前，中共山西省委第一书记陶鲁笳同志向全体下乡干部作了重要的指示。陶鲁笳同志首先明确指出，检查团必须同时完成、同时做好两项工作。即以收购粮食为中心的物资交流工作，和以巩固和发展农业生产合作社为中心的农村冬季生产工作。他强调指出：两项工作是党对农业进行社会主义改造的两个方面。两方面的工作做好了，就能稳步地实现对农业的社会主义改造，并为明年扩大再生产做好准备。因此，这两项工作必须而且可能同时结合进行，不允许偏废。接着陶鲁笳批判了
  一些同志的不正确态度，他们口头上拥护党的总路线，但一遇到具体政策问题和实际工作问题，思想观点就常常离开了党的总路线。例如：国家工业化对谁有利？国家收购粮食对谁有利？什么样的人才能算作粮食投机分子？对于这些问题有些同志常常得出了错误的结论。其原因，主要是由于他们没有根据党在过渡时期的总路线的精神来对具体问题进行具体的分析。
    关于怎样才能做好这两项工作，陶鲁笳指出：首先必须自上而下、自内而外的做好政治思想动员工作。大张旗鼓向农民宣传总路线总任务，要在党内开展反对资产阶级思想影响的斗争。宣传总路线总任务的最有效的方法，是通过典型事例，算账对比，使大家明确认识国家与个人的关系，城市与乡村的关系，现在与将来的关系，从而划清社会主义道路和资本主义道路的界限。第二、必须全面地正确地贯彻党的各项政策。在执行政策中要开展反右防“左”的两条战线的斗争。对广大中农必须坚持政治工作与经济工作相结合的原则，必须坚持采取说服教育的方式，当然对少数中农中自发的资本主义倾向，也必须进行必要的批评。另一方面还必须严格划清粮食投机分子和一般稍有投机行为的农民之间的界限。决不可乱戴“帽子”，以至影响农民的团结。第三、工作落后的区、乡要派强有力的干部去掌握；第四、要加强领导，加强检查，抓紧时间，提倡战斗作风，反对拖拉自流作风，要建立定期的汇报制度。
