Following the launch of the study of the general line for the transition period in various factories in Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, many workers actively promoted the general line to their rural relatives, encouraging them to sell surplus grain to the state.

In Wuxi, many workers come from peasant families. On Sundays, many workers return to the countryside to visit their families; and on weekdays, some farmers come to the city to talk to their relatives working in factories. After the study of the general line was launched, the workers further clarified that consolidating the worker-peasant alliance is the guarantee for realizing the general line, that peasants should take the road of mutual aid and cooperation, and that they should sell their surplus grain to the state. After hearing that speculative merchants were rushing to buy grain in the countryside and endangering the country, they were very angry and expressed that they would publicize this to their rural relatives, telling them not to be fooled by the merchants. Zhu Rongcai, a worker at the Shenxin No. 3 Factory, said during a study discussion that his family had been allocated land after liberation, and as their lives improved year by year, his grandfather planned to buy other people's land, hoarding the surplus grain at home and not selling it, waiting for a "good price." He said: "In the past, when I saw this kind of situation, I didn't think anything of it. I am a worker, and in the village, everyone looks at our family's actions. I have a responsibility to mobilize my family to set an example, to prevent them from being fooled by the merchants, to sell grain to the state, and not to take the capitalist road!" He recently received a letter from his father saying that he had sold the surplus grain to the state. The letter also said: "Grain-speculating merchants do not serve the working people; cooperatives are the ones who care about us working people."

Currently, many workers have taken active steps. Once Wang Xiuying, a female worker at the Shenxin No. 3 Factory, improved her understanding, she immediately mobilized her mother. She patiently talked to her mother about the prospects of the countryside and the path of socialist transformation of agriculture, and why it is necessary to sell surplus grain to the state. After being persuaded and mobilized by her daughter, her mother agreed to sell the surplus grain to the state. The veteran worker Zhou Quanyong used his personal experience to persuade his daughter to correct her idea of "waiting for the right price and being reluctant to sell." His daughter then carried five hundred catties of surplus grain to the cooperative to sell. Xiao Guanzhen, a female worker at Zhenxin Yarn Factory, even made a special trip back to her hometown on Sunday to persuade her father-in-law to sell the surplus grain to the state. Some workers whose families had surplus grain even more enthusiastically sold their surplus grain to the state. Lu Xichun, a demobilized soldier from Xin Yi Cloth Factory, had surplus grain in his own home. After listening to the report, he immediately went home and sold five hundred catties of surplus grain to the cooperative.

The Wuxi leadership is now preparing to further educate the workers on the worker-peasant alliance, so that the workers can correctly understand the contributions of the peasants to the country, help the peasants take the road of collectivization, and jointly build a socialist society.

    无锡市许多工人受到总路线教育后
    纷纷动员农村亲属把余粮卖给国家
    江苏省无锡市各工厂展开国家过渡时期总路线的学习以后，许多工人积极向农村亲属宣传总路线，动员他们把余粮卖给国家。
    在无锡市，有很多工人都是农民家庭出身。一到星期天，总有许多工人回到乡下看望；平时农民进城，也有些人要找在工厂做工的亲戚谈谈。这次展开总路线的学习以后，工人们进一步明确认识了巩固工农联盟是实现总路线的保证，农民应该走互助合作的道路，应该把余粮卖给国家。他们听到投机奸商在农村中抢购粮食危害国家的情形后，都非常气愤，纷纷表示要向农村亲属宣传，叫他们不要上奸商的当。申新三厂工人朱荣才在学习讨论时谈到，他家在解放后分到了田，等到生活一年比一年好起来，他爷就盘算着买别人的田，把余粮囤在家里不卖，等“好价钱”。他说：“过去我看到这种情形，并不觉得怎样。我是个工人，在村上，大家都看我们家里的举动。我有责任动员自己家里做出榜样来，要他们不上奸商的当，把粮食卖给国家，不走资本主义道路！”他最近接到他父亲的来信说已把余粮卖给了国家。信上并说：“粮食投机奸商不是为劳动人民服务的，合作社才为我们劳动人民着想。”
    目前，许多工人已积极行动起来。申新三厂女工王秀英认识一提高，马上就向她母亲进行了动员。她耐心地对她母亲谈农村的远景和对农业进行社会主义改造的道路，谈为什么要把余粮卖给国家。她母亲经过女儿的说服动员，已答应把余粮卖给国家。老工人周泉庸通过切身体验，说服女儿纠正了“等价惜售”的思想。他女儿当时就把五百斤余粮挑到合作社去卖了。振新纱厂女工萧冠珍还特地在星期日跑回乡下，说服她的公公把余粮卖给国家。有些工人家里有余粮的，更是踊跃把余粮卖给国家。新毅布厂陆锡春是个转业军人，自己家里有余粮。他听了报告后，随即回家卖了五百斤余粮给合作社。
    无锡市领导方面现在正准备进一步对工人进行工农联盟的教育，使工人正确地认识农民对国家的贡献，帮助农民走合作化的道路，共同建设社会主义社会。
