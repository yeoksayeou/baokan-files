Reader's Letters Abstract:

    Jiamusi Railway Branch's Han Baoguang writes: We often find that there is still residual oil in tank cars that have already been unloaded, especially tank cars loaded with gasoline and crude oil. After unloading, some still have 50 to 70 catties of oil left. Recently, at Weiling Station, 18 tank cars had residual oil after unloading, and one of them even had more than 100 catties of crude oil left. This situation will not only reduce the capacity of the wagons and cause a waste of transportation capacity, but also a loss of state property. With the development of national construction work, the amount of oil transported by rail will increase day by day, and this issue is even more worthy of our attention. Therefore, I suggest that all factories and mines that use railway tank cars should educate their staff to do a good job of unloading, and must completely unload the remaining oil in the tank cars during unloading.

    应该把油槽车内的存油卸清
    佳木斯铁路分局韩保光来信：我们经常发现已经卸过的油槽车内还存有残油的情况，特别是装载汽油与原油类的油槽车，在卸车后有的还剩油五十斤到七十斤。最近威岭车站有十八辆油槽车，卸车后都存有残油，其中有一辆竟剩下一百多斤原油。这种情况，不但会减少车皮的容量，造成运输力的浪费；而且也是国家财产的损失。随着国家建设工作的开展，铁路运输油脂的数量将日益增加，这个问题就愈加值得引起我们的注意。因此，我建议所有使用铁路油槽车的厂矿企业，应该教育工作人员认真做好卸车的工作，在卸车时必须把油槽车内的存油卸清。
