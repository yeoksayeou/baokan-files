A Letter from Home to a Soldier

    "Mom has been elected as a glorious people's representative!"
    Editor's Note: Deng Xiaonai is a first-class model military family member in Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, and is fifty-nine years old this year. She has six sons and two daughters, all of whom are engaged in revolutionary work. Among them, two sons are at the Korean front, and two sons serve in the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Among her eight children, five are Communist Party members, and three are Communist Youth League members. Recently, in the
  grassroots general election campaign in Hangzhou City, she was elected as a People's Representative. Below is a letter she wrote to her third son, Tang Ben, in Korea after being elected.
    Tang Ben, my son:
    In the past, you always wrote letters to Mom to report good news. This time, Mom should report good news to you: Mom has been elected as a glorious people's representative!
    On November 23rd, our electoral district (the 30th electoral district of Shangcheng District, Hangzhou City) held the election. That day, Mom got up at the crack of dawn, put on a newly made silk-padded jacket, and ran to the polling station to vote as soon as the sun shone on the eaves. Who knew, the polling station was already crowded with people. Mothers were holding babies, daughters-in-law were supporting mothers-in-law, and young girls were dressed in colorful clothes, talking and laughing, truly like a grand celebration. Some people, as soon as they received their ballots, hurriedly bowed to the statue of Chairman Mao; some people looked at the ballots again and again, as if they were reluctant to put them into the ballot box! They said: This vote did not come easily. If it weren't for Chairman Mao's good leadership, if it weren't for the Liberation Army and the Volunteer Army fighting in the wind and rain for so many years, how could we have today! Ben, you see, everyone thinks of Chairman Mao and of you when they encounter something satisfying!
    That very night, a general meeting was held to announce the election results. As soon as Mom entered the meeting place, the voters started clamoring to say to me:
  "Glorious Mom, I voted for you today!" "Glorious Mom, you're going to be elected"… I really didn't know how to answer. The result of the public opening of the ballot boxes and counting of the votes was that out of two thousand three hundred and sixty-eight voters, two thousand three hundred and fifty-four voted for Mom. Ben, who would have thought of such a thing in the past! The other two representatives elected were Comrade Liu Qi, secretary of the Shangcheng District Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Ni Ahui, a young transport worker. When the chairman announced the election of the three of us, the people sitting next to me helped and hugged me onto the stage, and the girls immediately jumped onto the stage to present us with flowers. Applause, firecrackers, and drums resounded as one, like thunder. Everyone asked me to speak, and I also felt that I had a lot to say, but for a moment I didn't know where to start. After a long while, I stuttered a few sentences: "Although I am almost sixty years old, I still have the strength of an old horse. My sons are defending the country in Korea, and I will definitely do some good things for everyone..."
    Back home, I put the flowers on top of the portrait of Chairman Mao hanging on the wall, looked at the certificate of election again and again, and compared it with the meritorious service reports of your second brother and fifth younger brother, and couldn't help but laugh. Mom thinks about the past and then about the present; it is truly two different worlds! Ben, you should remember that in the old society, our family had neither food nor clothing. Because you participated in revolutionary work, the reactionaries forced Mom so that the dark nights were not dark, and the days were not days. At that time, I was like an ant on a hot pot, and I couldn't be at peace even for a moment. After liberation, you were finally blessed by Chairman Mao. Those who did not participate in work have all participated in work and are serving the people. Because of this, Mom is unwilling to lag behind at home. No matter what the production work, sanitation work, or winter defense work... I run ahead and try to do it well, so as not to disgrace you. Ben, in fact, what Mom does is really nothing, and besides, it is what I should do; however, the masses respect Mom so much. As soon as I walk out of our house, this one calls "Glorious Mom," and that one calls "Glorious Mom," as if "Glorious Mom" has replaced my name. Even three- or five-year-old children, when they see me, will drag on the corner of my clothes and pat the stool to let me sit. The elementary school students in the nearby school come to our house every Sunday, singing, dancing, and vying to sweep the floor for us. If you don't let them do it, no one wants to! There are also some young people whom I have never met who either write letters or come to our house in person, wanting Mom to be their mother. Ben, if you return victoriously, your brothers and sisters will have no idea how many there will be! The Hangzhou City Democratic Women's Federation and the Resist America, Aid Korea branch have both recommended Mom as a standing committee member. Around the Spring Festival this year, the masses rated me as a first-class model military family member in the city.
    That's not all. In February last year, Li Xuesan, the head of the delegation you sent back, and Hong Chunzhe, the head of the Korean People's Visiting China Delegation, both personally came to our house to visit. In May this year, when the Korean Democratic People's Republic's Railway Art Troupe visited China and came to Hangzhou, they invited me to watch their performance. Also, when the fourth detachment of the Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea returned to Hangzhou, Deputy Head Chen Tongsheng personally gave me a silver ring. This silver ring was brought back by a Korean mother from Wonsan Port, whose name is Kim Jong-sun. She handed over her two children to the People's Army to fight the American devils with you. She also said to the comrades of the delegation: "We will never forget the great friendship of the Chinese people. Please give this silver ring, which was preserved in the American robbers' burning and killing, to a Chinese mother who sent her children to our Korea to resist American aggression, to express our Korean mother's infinite respect and heartfelt greetings to her!"
    Ben, see how kind-hearted the Korean mother is! Mom will never forget her words. Mom must be a good People's Representative, do a good job, support you to the final victory, and build our China into a beautiful socialist society.
                      Mom (written by Zhang Ruohuang on her behalf)

### “娘当选为光荣的人民代表啦！”

    “娘当选为光荣的人民代表啦！”
    编者按：邓小奶是浙江杭州市的一等模范军属，今年五十九岁。她有六个儿子，两个女儿，都参加了革命工作。其中两个儿子在朝鲜前线，两个儿子在中国人民解放军中服务。她的八个儿女当中，有五
  个是共产党员，有三个是青年团员。最近，在
  杭州市的基层普选运动中，她被选为人民代
  表。下边是她当选后，写给她在朝鲜的第三个
  儿子唐本的一封信。唐本儿：
    以前总是你们来信给娘报喜，这一回，可该娘给你报喜了：娘当选为光荣的人民代表啦！
    十一月二十三日那天，咱们这个选区（杭州市上城区第三十选区）举行了选举。这天天一亮，娘就起来了，换上新做的丝棉袄，太阳刚照上檐头，就跑到选举站去投票。谁知道，选举站老早就挤满了人，母亲抱着娃娃，媳妇扶着婆婆，年轻的姑娘都穿得花花绿绿的，又说又笑，真像办大喜事。有些人一拿到选举票，就连忙向毛主席的像鞠躬；有的人拿着选举票看了又看，好像舍不得投进票箱似的！他们说：这一票来得可不容易啊，要不是毛主席领导得好，要不是解放军和志愿军在风里、雨里打了那么多年仗，那有今天！本儿，你看，大家一碰到称心事，就想到了毛主席，就想到了你们！
    就在那天夜里开了大会，宣布了选举结果。娘一进会场，选民们就七嘴八舌地抢着对我说：
  “光荣妈妈，今天我投了你一票哩！”“光荣妈妈，要选到你啦”……说得我真不知道怎么回答。当众开箱计票的结果，二千三百六十八个选民当中，就有二千三百五十四个是投娘的票。本儿，过去谁会想到这种事呀！当选的另外两个代表，一个是中国共产党上城区区委会书记刘琦同志，还有一个是青年搬运工人倪阿惠。当主席宣布我们三个人当选的时候，坐在我旁边的人连扶带抱地把我拥上台去，姑娘们马上跳上台来向我们献花，掌声、鞭炮声、锣鼓声，响成一片，活像打雷一样。大家都叫我讲话，我也觉着有很多话要说，可是一时又不知道从那里说起，半晌才结结巴巴地说了几句：“虽说我快到六十岁了，可是还有股老劲。儿子在朝鲜保家卫国，我准能为大家办点好事……”
    回到家里，我把鲜花插在墙上挂着的毛主席像的上面，拿着当选证书看了又看，又把它和你二哥和五弟的立功喜报比了一下，就禁不住大笑起来。娘想想过去，又想想现在，真是两个天下！本儿，你该记得，在旧社会里，咱家吃没吃，穿没穿，为了你们参加革命工作，反动派把娘逼得黑夜不是黑夜，白天不是白天，那时真像热锅上的蚂蚁一样，一会儿也不能安生。解放了，你们总算是托毛主席的福，没有参加工作的，都参加了工作，去为人民服务了。就是因为这，娘在家也不愿落后，无论生产工作、卫生工作、冬防工作……，我都跑在前头，想办法把它做好，不给你们丢脸。本儿，按说娘做这一点事情真算不了什么，再说也是应该的呀；可是，群众对娘可尊重啦。我一走出咱家的大门，这个也叫“光荣妈妈”，那个也叫“光荣妈妈”，好像“光荣妈妈”就代替了我的名字一样。就是三五岁的小孩子，看到了我，也要拖住我的衣角，拍拍凳子让我坐。附近学校里的小学生，一到星期天就到咱家来，又是唱歌，又是跳舞，又是争着给咱扫地，不叫谁做，谁都不愿意！还有一些从来不相识的年轻人，不是写信来，就是亲自到咱家来，要娘做他们的妈妈。本儿，你要是胜利回来了，你的兄弟姊妹不知道会有多少！杭州市民主妇女联合会和抗美援朝分会，都推选娘当常务委员；今年春节前后，群众又把我评为全市的一等模范军属。
    这还不说，去年二月间，你们派回来的代表团团长李雪三同志和朝鲜人民访华代表团洪淳哲团长，都亲自到咱家来访问。今年五月里，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国访华铁道艺术团到了杭州，他们又请我去看他们的表演。还有，中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团第四分团回杭州时，陈同生副团长亲自送给我了一枚银戒指。这个银戒指是元山港的一个朝鲜母亲托他们带回来的，她的名字叫金贞先，她把两个孩子都交给了人民军，和你们一块打美国鬼子。她还对代表团的同志说：“我们永远不会忘记中国人民的伟大友谊，请你们把这枚在美国强盗烧杀当中所保留下来的银戒指，献给一个把自己的儿女送到我们朝鲜来反抗美国侵略者的中国母亲，表示我们朝鲜母亲对她的无限敬意和亲切的慰问！”
    本儿，看看朝鲜母亲是多么好的心眼呀！娘准不会忘了她的话。娘一定要把人民代表当好，工作做好，支援你们到最后胜利，把咱中国建设成美好的社会主义社会。
                      娘（张若煌代笔）
