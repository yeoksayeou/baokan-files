Most universities in Beijing conducted mid-term teaching inspections in November and December either comprehensively or with a focus on key areas. Through this inspection, some good teaching experiences were summarized and promoted in a timely manner, and some important problems existing in teaching were resolved. The Beijing Mining College exchanged teaching experience at a school-wide academic affairs meeting; the teaching experience exchange meeting held by the Department of Civil Engineering of Tsinghua University featured a report by the Water Supply and Drainage Teaching and Research Group on their experiences in teaching, which made teachers realize the importance of guiding students' learning, cultivating students' independent thinking ability, and conducting professional ideological education for students regularly. Some schools found problems such as students' learning being not solid or exceeding the prescribed study time during the inspection, and took measures such as appropriately streamlining teaching materials and improving teaching methods to solve them; teachers also realized that to teach students well, it is necessary to have a deep understanding of Soviet teaching materials, thus strengthening the learning and research of Soviet teaching materials. Tsinghua University found in the inspection that there were not enough teachers in each department and teaching and research group to prepare for future teaching tasks. For example, a teaching and research group with Soviet experts could not spare teachers to learn graduation thesis design from the experts, and the preparation of new courses originally planned also faced difficulties in more than a dozen courses due to insufficient manpower. Now, each department has come up with various ways to overcome this difficulty. For example, the Department of Civil Engineering has rationally rearranged manpower and spared seven teaching assistants to learn graduation thesis design from experts, preparing for the design guidance work of 120 graduates in 1955.

This semester, each university of engineering, comprehensive university, and normal university formulated school-wide teaching work plans in accordance with the decisions and spirit of the National Higher Industrial School Administrative Conference, the Comprehensive University Conference, and the Higher Normal Education Conference, with the main tasks of improving teaching quality and cultivating teachers. In order to ensure that all tasks are well implemented, each school has conducted inspections in a planned manner according to its specific circumstances. For example, Beijing Normal University used inspections to solve the leadership's busy and chaotic phenomenon to a certain extent; Beijing Mining College and other schools inspected the teaching effects and problems existing in teaching; in addition to inspecting current teaching work, Tsinghua University also focused on inspecting course design, graduation thesis design, and the preparation work for future teaching and teacher training.

During this inspection, each school generally adopted methods such as classroom tests, question and answer sessions, or investigation meetings to inspect students' learning. Teachers inspected the teaching effects from students' learning, and also clearly defined the problems existing in teaching, generally feeling that they had gained a lot. For example, after inspection, the teachers of the Anatomy and Physiology Teaching Group of the Biology Department of Beijing Normal University clarified that teaching can only be continuously improved by constantly understanding students' learning. Li Shantang, director of the Mineralogy and Petrology Teaching and Research Group of Beijing Mining College, realized the importance of planned teaching and collective teaching in the process of inspection.

Xinhua News Agency: Peking University Implements the Spirit of the National Comprehensive University Conference, Adjusts Teaching Organizations, Strengthens the Improvement and Training of Teachers, Conducts Scientific Research, and Improves Teaching Content and Teaching Methods, Further Improving Teaching Quality.

Since the new academic year, the science departments of Peking University have adopted the teaching plans revised at the Qingdao Symposium on Teaching Research in Science Departments of Comprehensive Universities convened by the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government, and the history, Chinese language, and political economics departments of the liberal arts have also made further revisions to the teaching plans in accordance with the spirit of the National Comprehensive University Conference. Most teaching and research offices in the school have conducted the formulation or revision of teaching syllabuses according to the new teaching plans.

The new teaching plans of various majors stipulate clearer training goals. According to the new teaching plans, many new courses have been opened this semester. Among the science courses, many have never been offered in universities in old China. Students in the mathematics departments of old Chinese universities took very few physics courses, but physics is closely related to mathematics. The Department of Mathematics and Mechanics of Peking University has opened the "Mathematical Physics Equations" course. The "Special Physics Experiment" jointly opened by the three teaching and research offices of electronics, solid-state physics, optics, and radiation in the Physics Department can provide students with a systematic grasp of the methods of studying physics through experiments. In the liberal arts, the proportion of basic courses and theoretical courses has been increased. For example, the new courses "Principles of Statistics" and "National Economic Planning" and the upcoming courses "Enterprise Organization and Planning" and "Industrial Economics" in the Economics Department are all to adapt to the development of national construction and teach students theoretical knowledge about socialist industrial economy.

In order to meet the needs of new teaching tasks, Peking University has adjusted the original 21 teaching and research groups and 34 teaching groups into 55 teaching and research offices and 8 teaching and research groups. Among them, the teaching and research offices of mechanics, electronics, solid-state physics, and Chinese philosophical history were newly established in this adjustment. In order to further put the work of the teaching and research office on the right track, the school has drafted a draft of the work regulations for the teaching and research office. Some teaching and research offices have now established a relatively formal work system.

After the adjustment of the teaching organization, some old professors who did not offer courses before have started teaching, and some are preparing to teach. Professor Xiong Wei, Ren Hua, and He Lin of the Western Philosophy History Teaching and Research Office of the Philosophy Department have opened the "Western Philosophy History" course this semester. Professor Feng Youlan and others of the Chinese Philosophy History Teaching and Research Office are preparing the teaching materials for the "Chinese Philosophy History" course and will begin teaching in the autumn of 1954.

In order to improve the professional level of teachers, all teachers of Peking University have formulated further study plans. Some teaching and research offices have also organized teachers to study relevant business theories. The Modern Literature Teaching and Research Office of the Department of Chinese Language and Literature is studying works on socialist realism literature. The Biology Department and the two teaching and research offices of General Psychology and Psychological Experiment studied the theories of Michurin and Pavlov. The teaching and research offices have adopted many methods for the training of lecturers and teaching assistants. Professor Hu Ning of the Physics Department also taught electrodynamics to lecturers and teaching assistants in the physics major. In order to help teaching assistants open courses, Duan Xuefu, director of the Mathematics Department, personally guided them in trial lectures. For lecturers and teaching assistants who have already opened courses, methods such as professors guiding them to write lecture notes and trial lectures are adopted to improve their teaching business ability.

The atmosphere of scientific research has gradually become stronger, which is a major change after Peking University conveyed the spirit of the National Comprehensive University Conference. At present, the science departments are determining the direction and focus of scientific research in conjunction with the preparation of specialized courses. The liberal arts departments are conducting special discussions in conjunction with the compilation of teaching materials, and gradually carrying out scientific research. (Xinhua News Agency)

    北京大部分高等学校进行了期中教学检查
    北京大学采取调整教学组织等措施提高了教学质量
    北京市大部分高等学校先后在十一月、十二月全面地或重点地进行了期中教学检查。通过这次检查，一些教学上好的经验得到及时的总结和推广，并解决了一些教学中存在的重要问题。北京矿业学院在全校教务会议上交流了教学工作经验；清华大学土木系召开的教学经验交流会，由给水下水教研组报告了他们进行教学工作的体会和经验，引起教师们认识到指导学生学习、培养学生独立思考能力及经常对学生进行专业思想教育的重要性。有些学校在检查中发现学生学习不巩固或超过规定学习时间的问题，分别采取适当精简教材和改进教学方法等办法加以解决；教师们也体会到要教好学生首先必需对苏联教材有深刻的体会，因而加强了对苏联教材的学习和研究。清华大学在检查中发现各系和教研组准备将来担任教学任务的教师不足，如有苏联专家的教研组抽不出教师向专家学习毕业论文设计，原订在计划中的准备新课的工作也有十几门因人力不足发生困难，现在各系已想出各种办法克服了这一困难。如土木系重新合理安排了人力，抽出了七个助教向专家学做毕业论文设计，为一九五五年一百二十名毕业生的设计指导工作作准备。
    本学期各工科大学、综合大学、师范大学根据全国高等工业学校行政会议、综合大学会议和高等师范教育会议的决定和精神制定了全校教学工作计划，以提高教学质量和培养师资为主要工作。为了保证各项工作很好执行，各校分别根据具体情况有计划地进行了检查。如北京师范大学通过检查来解决领导上一定程度的忙乱现象；北京矿业学院等校检查了教学效果及教学中存在的问题；清华大学除了检查当前的教学工作外，还特别着重检查了课程设计、毕业论文设计等和以后教学的准备工作和师资培养方面的情况。
    这次检查各校一般采取课堂测验、质疑答疑，或以调查会的方法检查了学生学习情况。教师们从学生学习情况中检查了教学效果，也较清楚地明确了在教学中存在的问题，普遍感到收获很大。如北京师范大学生物系解剖生理教学小组的教师们经过检查，明确了只有经常了解学生学习情况，才能不断改进教学。北京矿业学院矿岩教研组主任李善堂在检查的过程中认识了计划教学和集体教学的重要性。　（新华社）
    北京大学贯彻全国综合大学会议精神，调整教学组织，加强对师资的提高和培养工作，开展科学研究工作，改进了教学内容和教学方法，使教学质量有了进一步的提高。
    新学年以来，北京大学理科各专业采用了中央人民政府高等教育部在青岛召开的综合大学理科教学研究座谈会上所修订的教学计划，文科的历史、中国语文和政治经济学三个专业也根据全国综合大学会议精神把教学计划作了进一步的修订。全校大多数教研室根据新的教学计划进行了教学大纲的制订或修订工作。
    各种专业的新的教学计划，规定的培养目标更加明确。根据新的教学计划，本学期新开了许多课程。在理科的课程中，有很多是旧中国大学中所从来没有开过的。旧中国高等学校数学系的学生，念的物理课很少，但物理学和数学关系很大。北京大学数学力学系已开设了“数学物理方程”课。物理系电子学、固体物理、光学及辐射等三个教研室共同开设的“专门物理实验”，可供学生系统地掌握以实验来研究物理学的方法。在文科增加了基础课程和理论课程的比重。例如经济系新开设的“统计学原理”和“国民经济计划”以及即将开设的“企业组织与计划”、“工业经济”等课，都是为适应国家建设的发展，教给学生有关社会主义工业经济方面的理论知识。
    为适应新的教学任务的需要，北京大学已将原有的二十一个教研组和三十四个教学小组，调整为五十五个教研室和八个教研组。其中力学、电子学、固体物理和中国哲学史等教研室都是在这次调整中新成立的。为使教研室工作进一步走上正轨，学校已拟订了教研室的工作条例草案。有些教研室目前已建立了比较正规的工作制度。
    在教学组织调整之后，原来没开课的一些老教授，有的已经开课，有的正在准备开课。哲学系西方哲学史教研室教授熊伟、任华、贺麟等这学期已开设了“西方哲学史”课程。中国哲学史教研室教授冯友兰等，正准备“中国哲学史”课程的教材，将在一九五四年秋开始讲授。
    为了提高师资的业务水平，北京大学全体教师都已制订了进修计划。有的教研室还组织了教师们有关业务的理论学习。中国语言文学系现代文学教研室正学习有关社会主义现实主义文学著作。生物系及普通心理学、心理实验两教研室学习了米丘林和巴甫洛夫的学说。对讲师和助教的培养工作，各教研室采取了很多方法。物理系胡宁教授还给物理专业的讲师、助教讲授电动力学。数学系为了帮助助教开课，由系主任段学复亲自指导他们试讲。对已开课的讲师、助教，就采取教授指导他们写讲稿和试讲等方法来提高他们的教学业务能力。
    科学研究空气逐渐浓厚起来，是北京大学传达了全国综合大学会议精神后的重大转变。目前，理科各系正结合着专门化课程的准备，确定科学研究的方向和重点。文科各系结合着教材的编写工作，进行专题讨论，逐步地开展科学研究工作。
