CPC Songjiang County Committee Convenes Cadre Meeting
Creates Good Experience in Promoting the General Line

    In order to implement the general line and general task of the state during the transition period for education and combined deployment of grain procurement work, the CPC Songjiang County Committee convened an enlarged meeting of district and township cadres from November 11th to 24th, attended by more than 1,200 cadres. The meeting created a relatively systematic experience in educating rural cadres on the general line and general task.

    At the beginning of the meeting, Tan Zhenlin, Third Secretary of the CPC Central Committee East China Bureau, attended and made a report on the general line and general task of the Party during the transition period, which greatly encouraged the cadres. During the meeting, Jiang Weiqing, Second Secretary of the CPC Jiangsu Provincial Committee, gave clear instructions on the concerns and problems raised by the cadres in the discussion from the aspects of ideology, policy and work style. The meeting was very fruitful. The attending cadres generally reflected that they clearly understood the direction of the revolution, improved their socialist awareness and work enthusiasm, initially drew a clear line between socialist and capitalist ideology, recognized the importance of national industrialization and the worker-peasant alliance, understood the basic practices of socialist transformation of agriculture, and expressed their willingness to take the lead in selling surplus grain to ensure the completion of the national grain purchase task.

    The meeting in implementing the general line education, combined with the deployment of grain purchase work, roughly divided into the following three steps:

    First step, understand the general line of the transition period.

    First of all, according to the spirit of Comrade Tan Zhenlin's report, the County Committee made an enlightening report, and then organized everyone to discuss "What stage has the emancipation revolution reached? Where to go in the future? How to go?" In the discussion, it reflected the grass-roots cadres' yearning for a happy socialist life, but in the specific work, they often lost the direction of socialism. Therefore, many cadres were hesitant, depressed, and uneasy about their work, and spontaneous capitalist thoughts were rising day by day. When they knew that they were fighting for the construction of socialism, they were all very happy and encouraged.

    Then, through recalling the comparison, a detailed account of the great achievements of the country and the benefits farmers have received in the past four years was calculated to guide cadres to recognize that all the major work since liberation has been carried out in accordance with the general line formulated by Chairman Mao. Therefore, the achievements of the country and the benefits farmers have received are all victories of the general line. In the comparison and accounting, the most profound experience for everyone was that the output increased year by year: at the beginning of liberation, the average yield per mu in the county was less than 400 jin, it increased to 450 jin in 1951, the yield in 1952 approached 500 jin, and this year it has exceeded 500 jin; the number of cattle in the county increased by more than 15,000, and the number of piglets increased by more than 58,000. Due to the rapid recovery and development of production, the farmers' lives are improving day by day. Of the 184 households in Wu Jiaqiao Village, Changlou Township, only 18 households ate "two dry meals and one thin porridge" at the beginning of liberation, and the rest ate thin porridge, chaff, and sweet potatoes, but now 114 households eat "two dry meals and one thin porridge." Most of the members of the Lu Jinkui mutual aid team in Tinglin District have a set of Lenin suits, and most of the female members also made new woolen trousers this year. The improvement in farmers' lives is inseparable from the increase in the price ratio of agricultural products to industrial products. Before liberation, two dan of rice were needed to make a set of unlined clothes, but now only one dan of rice is needed; before liberation, one dou of rice could be exchanged for one jin of kerosene, but now it can be exchanged for five jin of kerosene. Comparing this year's prices with last year's, the farmers have also benefited a lot. For example, calculated by the eight items of iron pots, Longtou fine cloth, soap, raw oil, foreign yarn, brown sugar, salt, and hemp skin sold by the county's cooperatives this year, the prices are about 11.8 billion yuan cheaper than last year's. If you take this money to buy cattle, you can buy 11,791 and a half heads, and you can buy 118 water pumps. In the comparison before and after liberation and the year-by-year comparison after liberation, the leaders consciously enlightened and guided, so that most of the attending cadres recognized that the reason why they were able to get these benefits in the past four years was due to the victory of the Party's general line; due to the support of industry for agriculture; due to the growth of the country's socialist factors. They said: "The People's Bank is also socialist, so it thinks carefully and lends whatever the farmers lack." "It is convenient to take the train because the railway is also socialist." In this way, all the benefits were linked to the general line, which boosted confidence in building socialism. Not only that, but the attending cadres also realized from their own experience in the past four years that the more socialist factors, the greater the benefits farmers will receive. At the same time, they also understood that the current benefits are only the beginning, and life will be "better and better, sweeter and sweeter." When our country is built into a socialist power, farmers will have greater benefits. As the cadres in Fengjing District said: "Compared with the past, life is a hundred times better, but compared with the Soviet Union, it is 10,000 times worse."

    Second step, solve the problem of how to build socialism in rural areas. The main method is to carry out comparative education on the two different paths and two different futures of agricultural production, to enlighten everyone to talk about the suffering of the small-scale peasant economy, to achieve hatred of the old road, yearning for the new road, and to draw a clear ideological line between socialism and capitalism.

    First of all, discuss "the old road cannot be taken." The attending cadres used their personal experience to expose that the small-scale peasant economy is the "root of poverty" for farmers. In the discussion "Why could we not get rich in the past," many cadres cited specific examples to illustrate the essence of the small-scale peasant economy. For example, in Niushu Village, Caojing District, of the 167 households, only one household became rich and became a rich peasant before liberation, and the rest were poor and in debt; in Wangqian Township, Fengjing District, of the 1,100 households, only five rich peasants and two landlords became rich before liberation. The attending cadres generally reflected: "If we take the old road to get rich, we, the farmers, cannot be counted on. In the past, those who got rich were either puppet military officers or big bullies, either puppet township chiefs or speculative merchants. Diligent and thrifty farmers get up at dawn and sleep at midnight, but they still cannot make a living. Generations have wanted 'ten thousand taels of gold,' but they always cannot get rich." After everyone deeply talked about the suffering of the small-scale peasant economy, it further exposed the tragic fate that the small-scale peasant economy brought to the farmers. The deputy director of the Wangqian Township Farmers Association died his father at the age of eleven and had no money to bury him. His elder sister became a child bride, his younger sister was sent to others to raise, his younger brother died, and he worked as a hired laborer for seven years. He married a wife and bought cattle to farm, but before long, his wife died and he became poor again until the land reform when he was emancipated. The cadres in Chengxi District said: "In the past, most farmers lived a tragic life of 'buying bean cakes on credit to fertilize thin fields, leaking fields with broken waterwheels, borrowing money to pay dues, and poor ghosts falling into the well.'" Therefore, they compared the small-scale peasant economy to "leek life" that does not grow long; compared it to a "duck-watching boat" that capsizes at the slightest touch, and compared it to "dew on a dog's tail that falls off with a swing," even if it is "peach blossoms in March that are red for a while," it is still "empty after wind and rain"; and further realized that because the small-scale peasant economy itself is unstable, it will inevitably lead to exploitation and class differentiation. If the small-scale peasant economy is not transformed, "poor for three stones, rich for three stones, not much wealth," and the result must still be "thousands of families die in hardship, and one household gets rich." Through the above recollections, comparisons, and detailed calculations, the class consciousness of the attending cadres was greatly improved, and they realized that if the small-scale peasant economy is not transformed, if it develops, only a few people will get rich and most people will be poor. They generally felt that "taking the road before liberation is a dead end."

    Second, solve the problem of how to take the socialist new road. It began with comparing the happy lives of the Soviet people today and comparing the lives of farmers before and after liberation, to further understand the need to get rich collectively, to rely on industrialization, to rely on agricultural cooperation, and to rely on the worker-peasant alliance. The most profound and most intimate experience for everyone was this year's drought resistance struggle. The cadres in Caojing District said: "In 1934, it did not rain for more than 50 days, and all the rice fields were deserted. This year, it also did not rain for more than 50 days, but this year there are mutual aid teams and water pumping machines that the government supported in time, so the output is still not bad." The cadres in Wulong Township, Chengdong District, calculated an account: if the township had water pumping machines this year, each mu could definitely yield 50 jin more grain, and the entire township could yield 430,000 jin more. After such comparison and accounting, realizing socialist industrialization became the conscious demand of the attending cadres. In order to help the attending cadres deepen their understanding of industrialization, the County Committee held an exhibition, using various charts, objects, and models, using the method of comparison and accounting, to reflect the increase in the means of production after liberation, the improvement of farmers' lives, and the increase in the price ratio of agricultural products to industrial products. Many cadres said after seeing the exhibition: "The national industrialization has given us so many benefits, and we still don't know it!" At the same time, cadres were organized to visit the General Machinery Factory and the Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory, so that everyone further understood the importance of industrialization. On the basis of cadres having a deeper understanding of socialist industrialization, the cadres were further made to clearly recognize that developing mutual aid and cooperation in rural areas and doing a good job in purchasing grain is taking the socialist road. To this end, the meeting made a supplementary report on cooperation and grain purchase work. In the discussion, the weaknesses of the small-scale peasant economy were further criticized. It was unanimously believed that after the land reform, although the land was distributed and life was improved, the small-scale peasant economy was still not able to withstand natural disasters and diseases. For example, Zhou Zhaosheng, a farmer in Xinbang Village, Sijing District, had a family of ten. At the time of the land reform, he was allocated 30 mu of land, and his life was very good. Unfortunately, his daughter-in-law died in 1951, and he sold 10 mu of land. This year, Zhou Zhaosheng died, and he pledged another 10 mu of land. At the same time, the discussion also reflected that in places where the mutual aid and cooperation movement was not well developed, class differentiation was relatively serious. For example, Fang Laiyun, a farmer in Liu Zhao Village, Caojing District, worked alone last year, and each mu only yielded 280 jin, and his life was difficult, and he pawned 2 mu of land; but this year, after participating in the mutual aid team, the yield per mu reached 350 jin, his life improved, and the 2 mu of land was also redeemed. Cadres reflected: "There is a little bit of socialist buds in the mutual aid team, and the output is higher than that of individual farmers. The production cooperative is semi-socialist, and the output is higher than that of the mutual aid team, proving that the more socialist factors, the higher the output." After the attending cadres recognized the importance of developing mutual aid and cooperation, most of them consciously checked their mistakes in laissez-faire towards the mutual aid team this year, as well as their fear of leading the mutual aid team, and expressed their willingness to go back to develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement in accordance with the principle of active leadership and steady progress.

    Third, after clearly recognizing that "the old road must never be taken" and "only taking the socialist road is the only happy road for farmers," the attending cadres consciously criticized their capitalist thoughts. Zhu Zhilin, the militia captain of Xinjian Township, painfully reviewed his five-year plan for developing capitalism (first hoarding grain and lending money, then building houses and buying fields, working as a carpenter himself, and having the land cultivated by the mutual aid team, turning from a poor peasant into a rich peasant. He has now bought two mu of land and will soon be able to buy another one and a half mu, and pay waterwheel wages). After ideological struggle, the confidence and determination of many cadres in taking the socialist road were further strengthened.

    Third step, deploy grain purchase work. The main task is to guide the attending cadres to further recognize that grain purchase work is a concrete step in taking the socialist road on the basis of drawing a clear ideological line between capitalism and socialism.

    First of all, repeatedly explain the significance and benefits of selling surplus grain to the state. After the attending cadres understood the great significance of grain purchase work for guaranteeing national construction, consolidating national defense, and stabilizing the market, they began to expose the heinous activities of speculative merchants who hoarded grain, cut prices, raised prices, and cheated by adulterating goods, and recalled the suffering that merchants gave farmers, how merchants colluded with landlords and reactionaries to defraud farmers before liberation, causing the pain of "disaster in harvest," and the crimes of continuing to buy grain, hoard, disrupt the market, and endanger national construction after liberation. For example, the five villages in Dongjing Township, Chengdong District, borrowed more than 110 million yuan in usurious loans from speculative grain merchants this spring, and repaid more than 180 million yuan after the autumn harvest, with a net interest of more than 70 million yuan. In particular, speculative grain merchants used vicious methods such as buying green seedlings to lend usurious loans. Just in Dongjing Township, calculating the accounts, the farmers had to pay more than 500,000 jin of rice for the usurious loans they borrowed (more than 400 million yuan). This surprised everyone and said: "We have been busy increasing production all year round, and we never thought that the rice produced by increasing production on more than 10,000 mu of land would flow into the hands of merchants." Therefore, many cadres consciously checked their many wrong ideas in the past, such as thinking that private merchants "have good prices," and helping private merchants to套购grain, "buying things depends on cooperatives, selling things depends on private merchants" and other wrong behaviors, and expressed their support for and firm completion of the grain purchase task.

    Secondly, in response to the ideological concerns of the cadres, explain the policies and specific methods, repeatedly clarify the ideas, so that the attending cadres truly achieve "the principle is clear, the details are clear, and the methods are clear." They expressed their willingness to respond to the leadership's call, correct their mistakes, be good cadres, and take the lead in selling surplus grain to the state.

    When organizing discussions, the County Committee flexibly used a variety of different methods according to different situations. Discuss and summarize at any time, discover and solve problems in a timely manner, so as to continuously enlighten and continuously improve. If it is found that there are places that are not thoroughly resolved, the county and district will make supplementary reports or supplementary speeches to make up lessons. And pay attention to cultivating typical examples, sharing personal experiences, and combining general education with individual conversations and patient help. Finally, in order to further consolidate ideological achievements, set up role models, and unify understanding, a general meeting of typical speeches was organized. The content was vivid and powerful, which greatly enlightened and promoted the attending cadres, creating a warm atmosphere of completing the grain purchase task and supporting national industrialization.

    Throughout the entire education process, the Songjiang County Committee implemented the criticism of the capitalist thoughts and various muddled ideas existing in the cadres, and implemented the drawing of a clear ideological line between socialism and capitalism. Whether it was organizing discussions and carrying out criticism and self-criticism, or recalling, comparing, accounting, and complaining, all were for the purpose of improving the cadres' socialist ideological level and criticizing capitalist thoughts and various muddled ideas in the cadres. In the entire education process, the Songjiang County Committee especially emphasized protecting the enthusiasm of rural cadres, and adopted the policy of education and transformation for those cadres who had capitalist thoughts. In addition, the Songjiang County Committee also conducted specific analysis of cadres with different ideological situations, adopted different methods, conducted different education, and firmly grasped the ideological roots of the cadres in each paragraph and each link, prescribed the right medicine, and never gave up halfway, and strived to achieve the purpose of solving ideological problems.

    The meeting summary emphasized that the following three links should be focused on for the implementation of the general line education and the completion of the grain purchase task: First, concentrate efforts to hold well the meetings of township cadres, activists, and people's representatives; Second, earnestly do a good job in various necessary preparations for grain purchase; Third, earnestly do a good job in the base point work, first obtain experience, so as to effectively promote the overall situation.

    Finally, the County Committee comprehensively deployed the winter work to the attending cadres, with production as the center, grain purchase work as the focus, and general line publicity as the driving force.

    中共松江县委召开干部会议
    创造了宣传总路线的好经验
    为了贯彻国家在过渡时期的总路线、总任务教育和结合布置粮食收购工作，中共松江县委于十一月十一日至二十四日间召开了区乡干部扩大会议，到会干部一千二百余人。会议创造了比较系统的向乡村干部进行总路线、总任务教育的经验。
    会议开始，中共中央华东局第三书记谭震林同志到会，作了关于党在过渡时期总路线、总任务的报告，对干部鼓舞很大。会议期间，中共江苏省委第二书记江渭清同志又针对干部在讨论中产生的顾虑和问题，从思想、政策和工作作风等各方面作了明确的指示。这次会议收获很大，到会干部普遍反映明确地认识了革命方向，提高了社会主义的觉悟和工作的积极性，初步划清了社会主义和资本主义的思想界限，认识到国家工业化和工农联盟的重要意义，懂得了对农业实行社会主义改造的基本做法，纷纷表示带头出卖余粮，保证国家购粮任务的完成。
    会议在贯彻总路线教育，结合布置粮食收购工作方面，大体上是分为以下三个步骤进行的：
    第一步，弄通过渡时期总路线。
    首先，根据谭震林同志报告的精神，县委又作了一个启发报告，然后组织大家讨论“翻身革命已走到那一步？今后再往那里走？怎样走法？”在讨论中，反映了基层干部向往社会主义的幸福生活，但在具体工作中，又往往迷失了社会主义的方向，因此，不少干部徘徊、苦闷、不安心工作，自发的资本主义思想日益上升。当他们知道了目前就是在为建设社会主义而奋斗时，莫不欢欣鼓舞。
    接着，通过回忆对比，算了一笔四年来国家伟大成就和农民得到好处的细账，引导干部认清解放以来的一切重大工作，都是遵循着毛主席制订的总路线而进行的，因此，国家的成就和农民得到的好处，都是总路线的胜利。在对比算账中，大家体会得最深刻的是产量年年提高：刚解放时，全县平均每亩产量还不到四百斤，一九五一年增产至四百五十斤，一九五二年的产量接近五百斤，今年已经超过五百斤了；全县耕牛增加了一万五千多头，猪仔增加了五万八千多只。由于生产的迅速恢复和发展，农民生活日趋改善。长楼乡吴家桥村一百八十四户中，刚解放时只有十八户吃“二干一稀”，其余都吃稀、吃糠、吃番瓜，现在已有一百十四户吃“二干一稀”。亭林区陆金奎互助组组员大都有了一套列宁装，今年多数女组员还新做了呢裤子。而农民生活上的这种改善又是与农产品交换工业品的比价提高分不开的，解放前要两石米做一套单衣，现在只要一石米就能做起来；解放前一斗米换一斤火油，现在可以换到五斤火油。从今年与去年的价格比较，农民得到的好处也很大，如以全县合作社今年卖出的铁锅、龙头细布、肥皂、生油、洋纱、红糖、食盐、麻皮八项东西计算，比去年的价格便宜了约一百十八亿元，拿这些钱去买耕牛，就可买到一万一千七百九十一头半，买抽水机可以买到一百十八部。在解放前后对比和解放后逐年对比中，领导上又有意识地启发引导，使到会干部大都认清了四年来所以能够得到这些好处，是由于党的总路线的胜利；由于工业对农业的支持；由于国家的社会主义因素的增长。他们说：“人民银行也是社会主义的，所以想得周到，农民缺什么贷什么。”“乘火车便当了，因为铁路也是社会主义的”。这样，便把条条好处，和总路线联系起来，鼓舞了建设社会主义的信心。不仅如此，到会干部还从自己四年来的经验中体会到：社会主义的因素越多，农民得到的好处就会越大。同时，还懂得了现在的好处还仅仅是开始，日子会过得“好了还要好，甜了还要甜”。当我国建设成为社会主义的强国后，农民会有更大的好处，如枫泾区干部说：“比比过去生活是好了一百倍，比起苏联，还差一万倍。”
      第二步，解决如何在农村中建设社会主义的问题。主要方法是进行农业生产的两条不同道路、两个不同前途的对比教育，启发大家诉小农经济的苦，达到仇恨老道路，向往新道路，划清社会主义和资本主义的思想界限。
    首先，讨论“老路走不得”。到会干部以亲身体验，揭露小农经济是农民的“穷根子”。在讨论
  “过去想富，为什么富不了”时，不少干部列举具体事例说明了小农经济的本质。如漕泾区牛树村一百六十七户中，解放前只有一户发了家，成了富农，其余都贫困负债；枫泾区王钱乡一千一百户中，解放前只发了五户富农、二户地主。到会干部普遍反映：“走老道路发财，数不到我们种田的，过去发财的不是伪军官，就是大恶霸，不是伪乡长，就是投机商人，勤俭农民五更起、半夜睡，还糊不了口，祖祖辈辈想‘黄金万两’，但总是发不了财。”当大家深入地诉说了小农经济的苦处以后，就越加暴露了小农经济带给农民的悲惨命运。王钱乡农会副主任十一岁死了父亲，没钱埋葬，姊姊做了童养媳，妹妹送给别人抚养，弟弟死掉，自己当了七年雇工，娶了老婆，买了耕牛，自己种田，但隔不多久，老婆死了，又穷困下去，直到土地改革才翻了身。城西区干部说：“过去大多数农民是过着‘赊饼（豆饼）垩瘦田，破车踏漏田，借债缴会钱，穷鬼落井潭’的悲惨日子。”因此，他们把小农经济比作“韭菜命”长不长；比作“看鸭船”一碰就翻，又比作是“狗尾巴上的露水一摆动就掉了”，即使是“三月桃花一时红”，但还是“风吹雨打一场空”；并且，进一步体会到由于小农经济本身不稳定，必然会产生剥削，必然会有阶级分化。小农经济如不改造，“穷三石，富三石，没有多大富头”，而结果一定还是“苦死千家，发财一户”。通过以上的回忆、对比、算细账，大大提高了到会干部的阶级觉悟，认识到小农经济不改造，发展下去，只有少数人发财，多数人贫困。普遍感到“走解放前的道路是死路一条”。
    第二，解决如何走社会主义新路的问题。开始从对比今天苏联人民幸福的生活和对比农民解放前后的生活着手，进一步搞通要集体致富，要依靠工业化，要依靠农业的合作化，要依靠工农联盟。大家体会最深刻最亲切的是今年的抗旱斗争。漕泾区干部说：“一九三四年五十多天不下雨，稻田全部荒掉，今年也是五十多天不下雨，但今年有互助组，有政府及时支援的戽水机，所以，产量仍旧不差。”城东区五龙乡干部算了一笔账：如果今年该乡有戽水机，每亩一定可以再多打五十斤粮食，全乡就可多打四十三万斤。经过这样对比算账，实现社会主义工业化，变成了到会干部的自觉要求。县委为了帮助到会干部加深对工业化的理解，举办了展览会，运用各种图表、实物和模型，用对比算账的方法，反映了解放后生产资料的增加，农民生活的改善以及农产品交换工业品比价的提高。许多干部看过展览会后说：“国家工业化给了我们这许多好处，我们还不晓得！”同时，又组织干部参观通用机器厂和上海电机厂，使大家进一步理解工业化的重要。在干部对社会主义工业化有了较深的理解的基础上，进一步使干部明确认识在农村中发展互助合作，做好收购粮食工作就是走社会主义的道路。为此，会议又作了合作化和收购粮食工作的补充报告。在讨论中，深入一步地批判了小农经济的弱点，一致认为土地改革后，虽然分到了土地，生活虽然有了改善，可是小农经济毕竟是经不起天灾病祸的，如泗泾区新浜村农民周照生，全家十口人，土地改革时，分了三十亩田，生活很好，不巧在一九五一年死了媳妇，卖掉十亩田，今年周照生死了，又顶去十亩田。同时，在讨论中也反映了凡是互助合作运动开展得不好的地方，阶级分化就比较严重，如漕泾区刘赵村农民方来云，去年单干，每亩只收二百八十斤，生活困难，典掉了二亩田；而今年参加了互助组之后，每亩产量达到三百五十斤，生活好转，二亩田也赎回来了。干部反映：“互助组当中有一点点社会主义芽子，产量就比单干农民高，生产合作社是半社会主义的，产量又比互助组高，证明社会主义因素越多，产量就越高。”到会干部在认识了发展互助合作的重要意义后，大都自觉地检查了今年对互助组放任自流的错误，以及怕领导互助组的畏难情绪，纷纷表示要回去根据积极领导和稳步前进的方针发展互助合作运动。
    第三，在明确认识了“老路万万走不得”，“只有走社会主义的道路，才是农民唯一的幸福的道路”后，到会干部就自觉地批判了自己的资本主义思想。新建乡民兵队长朱志林沉痛地检讨了自己发展资本主义的五年计划（先囤粮放债，再盖房买田，自己做木匠，土地由互助组耕作，由贫农变成富农。现已买了两亩田，马上可再买一亩半，并放车水工资）。许多干部经过思想斗争后，对走社会主义道路的信心和决心就更加增强了。
    第三步，布置收购粮食工作。主要引导到会干部在划清资本主义和社会主义的思想界限的基础上，进一步认识收购粮食工作是走社会主义道路的一个具体步骤。
    首先，把余粮卖给国家的意义、好处反复讲清楚。到会干部弄通了收购粮食工作对保障国家建设巩固国防和稳定市场等方面的重大意义后，开始揭发投机奸商囤积粮食、杀价、抬价、搀假欺骗等伤天害理的活动，并纷纷回忆奸商给予农民的苦处，解放前奸商如何与地主、反动派勾结起来欺诈农民，造成“丰收成灾”的痛苦，以及解放后继续抢购粮食，囤积居奇，捣乱市场，危害国家建设等罪行。如城东区洞泾乡的五个村，今年春天向投机粮商借高利贷一亿一千多万元，秋收后付还一亿八千多万元，净息七千多万元。尤其投机粮商采用买青苗等恶毒方式放高利贷，仅洞泾一乡算一算账，农民所借高利贷（四亿多元），就要付稻谷五十多万斤，这使大家大吃一惊，说：“一年到头忙着增产，想不到一万多亩田增产的稻谷都要流到奸商手里去了。”因而不少干部自觉地检查了过去的许多错误想法，如认为私商“价钱好”，以及帮助私商套购粮食、“买东西靠合作社，卖东西靠私商”等错误的行为。表示拥护并坚决完成购粮任务。
    其次，针对着干部的思想顾虑，交代政策和具体办法，反复地打通思想，使到会干部真正达到“道理通，具体通，办法通”。他们纷纷表示响应领导号召，改正错误，做个好干部，并带头把余粮卖给国家。
    在组织讨论时，县委按不同情况，灵活运用了多种不同的方法。随时讨论，随时小结，及时地发现问题解决问题，做到不断启发，不断提高。发现有解决不透的地方，由县、区作补充报告或补充发言，进行补课。并注意培养典型，现身说法，把一般教育与个别谈话、耐心帮助结合起来。最后，为了进一步巩固思想成果，树立榜样，统一认识，又组织了大会典型发言。内容生动有力，对到会干部启发推动很大，造成了完成购粮任务支持国家工业化的热烈气氛。
    在整个教育过程中，松江县委贯彻着批判干部中存在着的资本主义思想及各种糊涂观念，贯彻着划清社会主义与资本主义的思想界限，不论是组织讨论与开展批评与自我批评，也不论是回忆、对比、算账和诉苦，都为了达到提高干部的社会主义思想水平、批判干部中资本主义思想和各种糊涂观念的目的。松江县委在整个教育过程中，特别重视了保护乡村干部的积极性，对那些存在着资本主义思想的干部，采取教育改造的方针。此外，松江县委还对不同思想情况的干部进行了具体的分析，采用不同方法，进行不同的教育，并抓紧在每一段落、每一环节中深深挖出干部的思想根源，对症下药，绝不中途而废，务求达到解决思想问题的目的。
    在会议总结中着重指出对贯彻总路线教育和完成购粮任务应着重抓住以下三个环节：一，集中力量开好各乡干部积极分子会议与人民代表会议；二，切实做好收购粮食的各项必要的准备工作；三，切实做好基点工作，先行取得经验，以便有力地推动全面。
    最后，县委向到会干部全面的布置了以生产为中心，以购粮工作为重点，以总路线宣传为动力的冬季工作。
