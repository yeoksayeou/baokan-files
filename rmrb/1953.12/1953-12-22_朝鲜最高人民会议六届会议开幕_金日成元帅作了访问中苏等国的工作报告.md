Following Kim Tu-bong's proposal, all attendees stood in silent tribute to the benefactor and closest friend of the Korean people’s liberation—the great Stalin—and to the heroic officers and soldiers of the Korean People's Army, male and female guerrillas, soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and Korean political activists who sacrificed themselves in the Korean people's Fatherland Liberation War.

Marshal Kim Il-sung's report was warmly welcomed by all attendees, frequently interrupted by thunderous applause.

The first day of the meeting ended at 6:00 PM.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 21st: Korean public opinion warmly supports the convening of the Sixth Session of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea.

The "Democratic Korea" newspaper published an editorial on the 20th, stating that the Sixth Session of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea will discuss a series of important issues concerning the promotion of the post-war recovery and development of the people's economy and the strengthening of the democratic base. We, the Korean people, are determined to display a heroic and selfless spirit in every position, further enhance revolutionary vigilance, and prepare to strive for the correct implementation of the various decisions adopted by this session.

The Korean Central News Agency also published a commentary stating that the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, from the first day of its composition, has become the highest organ of state power of the Korean people, fully playing its role in safeguarding the interests of the people and consolidating the achievements of the people's struggle. At the first session, it formally adopted the Constitution of the Republic, established the government of the Republic headed by Premier Kim Il-sung, and adopted the platform proposed by Premier Kim Il-sung. In the three years and ten months since the Fifth Session was convened in February 1950, it has led our Korean people to defeat the American imperialists. Today, the historical and arduous task facing the Korean people is: with the assistance of the people of the great Soviet Union, China, and various People's Democratic countries, to actively restore and develop the people's economy devastated by the war, improve the people's lives, and further strengthen national defense in order to achieve the peaceful reunification of the fatherland. Therefore, the convening of the Sixth Session of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea is of great significance.
