Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 13th: Asper, the former Deputy Head of the Swiss Delegation to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, deliberately distorted the facts and slandered the Korean and Chinese side when he passed through San Francisco on his way back to his country from Korea on the 9th, saying: "You would assume that after a war, there would be replacements of personnel and outdated equipment, but in the North, almost nothing like that happened, either in terms of personnel or materials." Asper's words were intended to insinuate that the Korean and Chinese side secretly replaced personnel and equipment. The American propaganda machine, Associated Press, took the opportunity to extend Asper's words for slanderous propaganda, saying: "There is no evidence to show that the Communists are transporting unauthorized weapons and personnel into North Korea through legal channels." This is to slander the Korean and Chinese side for transporting personnel and weapons into Korea from outside the country through illegal channels.

However, the rotation and replacement work of the Korean and Chinese side was carried out under the supervision of the neutral inspection teams of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. The commentary on the rotation of military personnel and the replacement of war materials on the Korean and Chinese side, submitted by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission on November 10, which was also signed by the Swiss Commissioner, pointed out: "The figures reported by that side are the same as those reported by the neutral inspection teams, and are within the limits stipulated in the Armistice Agreement." The commentary also pointed out: "That side has not reported the replacement of combat aircraft, armored vehicles, and ammunition, and the neutral inspection teams have not observed any replacements either." This commentary clearly shows that the Korean and Chinese side has replaced personnel and materials, and it has been done in accordance with the methods stipulated in the Armistice Agreement.

Not only that, Asper's own personal experience proves that he is fully aware that the Korean and Chinese side strictly abides by the provisions of the Armistice Agreement regarding rotation and replacement. In September of this year, when Asper and Polish Alternate Commissioner Bibrowski went to inspect the specific rear ports of the Korean and Chinese side, the neutral inspection teams stationed in Sinuiju, Hungnam, and Chongjin, including Swiss personnel, wrote letters thanking the Korean and Chinese side for providing them with full convenience and respect in their work. The letter of thanks from the team stationed in Chongjin was written at the suggestion of Swiss member Major Bieri. When the U.S. side groundlessly accused the Korean and Chinese side of transporting combat aircraft in crates into Uiju Airport, the Fourth Mobile Neutral Nations Supervisory Team, chaired by a Swiss member, went to Uiju for on-site observation and inspection and confirmed that the U.S. side's accusation was unfounded. Asper, as the Swiss Alternate Commissioner, agreed to the common conclusion made by the four neutral members of the team on this U.S. accusation and signed the audit of the investigation report submitted by the team on November 18. But now, Asper pretends to be very forgetful and wants to portray the Korean and Chinese side as violating the Armistice Agreement, and babbles untrue things like "they talk about peace, but never talk about freedom," which is unreasonable.

Asper clearly knows that it is not the Korean and Chinese side but the U.S. side that violates the Armistice Agreement. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission has confirmed that the numbers of military personnel rotations reported by the U.S. side differ significantly from those reported by the neutral inspection teams. The Swiss and Swedish Commissioners of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission also "acknowledged the fact that 106 disassembled mortars were unloaded in Busan after the Armistice Agreement came into effect," and this fact is a clear and serious violation of the Armistice Agreement. The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, including the Swiss Commissioner, unanimously believes that "it is doubtful whether the U.S. side has always replaced combat aircraft on a one-to-one basis with the same type and performance." Why didn't Asper even mention this blatant violation of the Armistice Agreement by the U.S. side?

### 中立国监察委员会瑞士代表团前任副团长  阿斯伯竟抹杀我方严守停战协定的事实

    阿斯伯竟抹杀我方严守停战协定的事实
    【新华社开城十三日电】中立国监察委员会瑞士代表团前任副团长阿斯伯九日在从朝鲜返国途经旧金山时，故意歪曲事实，诬蔑朝中方面说：“你会假定，在经过一次战争之后，会替换人员和陈旧装备，但是，在北边，几乎完全没有这样的事，无论在人员方面或是在物资方面。”阿斯伯这话是想影射朝中方面秘密地替换了人员和装备。美国造谣机关美联社乘机引伸阿斯伯的话进行诬蔑宣传，说：“没有证据说明共方在通过合法途径把未经许可的武器和人员运进北朝鲜”。这就是想诬蔑朝中方面通过非法途径从朝鲜境外运入人员和武器。
    但是，朝中方面的轮换和替换工作是在中立国监察委员会的中立国视察小组的监督之下进行的。中立国监察委员会十一月十日提出的、瑞士委员也签了字的关于朝中方面军事人员轮换和作战物资替换的评论指出：“该方所报告的数字与各中立国视察小组所报告的数字相同，并在停战协定所规定的限额以内。”评论还指出：“该方并未报告作战飞机、装甲车辆与弹药的替换，而各中立国视察小组亦未观察到有替换的情况。”这个评论清楚地说明朝中方面替换了人员和物资，而且是依停战协定规定的办法来进行的。
    不仅如此，阿斯伯本人的亲身经历证明，他是完全清楚地知道朝中方面严格遵守停战协定关于轮换和替换的规定的。在今年九月间，阿斯伯和波兰候补委员毕勃洛夫斯基去朝中方面的特定后方口岸视察时，驻新义州、兴南和清津的中立国视察小组，包括瑞士人员在内，曾写信感谢朝中方面给予他们工作上的充分便利和尊重，驻清津的小组的感谢信还是在瑞士组员比埃里少校的提议下写成的。当美方毫无根据地诬称朝中方面把作战飞机装箱运入义州机场时，由瑞士组员任主席的第四机动中立国视察小组曾去义州进行现场观察和视察，并且证实美方的指控是毫无根据的。作为瑞士候补委员的阿斯伯曾同意该小组四个中立国的组员对美方这一诬控所作的共同结论，并且在十一月十八日签署了对这个小组所提出的调查报告的审定。但是现在，阿斯伯却装得十分健忘的样子，想把朝中方面说成违反停战协定，并且胡扯什么“他们谈论和平，但从不谈论自由”等不合乎事实的谎话，这是没有道理的。
    阿斯伯明明知道，违反停战协定的并不是朝中方面而是美方。中立国监察委员会曾经证实：美方所报告的军事人员轮换的数字，与各中立国视察小组报告的数字有重大的差异。中立国监察委员会的瑞士和瑞典委员还“承认在停战协定生效以后一百零六门拆散了的迫击炮在釜山卸下的事实”，而这一事实是明显的严重违反停战协定的。中立国监察委员会包括瑞士委员在内一致认为：美方的“作战飞机是否始终在同样类型、同样性能一件换一件的基础上进行替换是有疑问的”。阿斯伯对于美方这种彰明较著的违反停战协定的行为，为什么连提都没有提呢？
