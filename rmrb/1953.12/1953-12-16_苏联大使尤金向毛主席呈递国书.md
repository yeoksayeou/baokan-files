Ambassador Yudin's Eulogy

Comrade Chairman:

    I am very honored to present to you the credentials from the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics appointing me as Ambassador of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to the People's Republic of China.
    The great victory won by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party over domestic and international reactionary forces has created favorable conditions for the development of close friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China, which has deep historical roots. The unbreakable friendly alliance between our two peoples not only has a tremendous positive impact on the continuous upsurge of our two countries' economies and cultures and the growth of people's welfare, but is also a strong bulwark of peace and security in the Far East and the world.
    Comrade Chairman, I would like to assure you that I will spare no effort to further strengthen this great alliance, fraternal friendship, and close cooperation between the peoples of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the People's Republic of China.
    I am confident that in carrying out my duties as ambassador, I will receive the necessary support and assistance from you and the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China.
    I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt admiration for the comprehensive progress made by the great Chinese people in carrying out various historical reforms in their own country in the past four years.
    I would like to express the feelings of the entire Soviet people, and warmly wish the friendly Chinese people and the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China new achievements in the cause of realizing the national industrialization plan, developing agriculture, improving the people's welfare, and vigorously strengthening their people's democratic country.
    Comrade Chairman, I sincerely wish the government of the People's Republic of China and yourself new achievements in activities dedicated to the happiness and prosperity of your great country.

Chairman Mao's Reply

Comrade Ambassador:

    I am very pleased to accept the credentials from the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics that you have presented, and I sincerely thank you for your congratulations.

    The fraternal friendship between the People's Republic of China and the great Union of Soviet Socialist Republic has made great progress and has been consolidated over the past four years. The Chinese people have always valued the friendship of the Soviet Union, and today, in engaging in large-scale national economic construction, they have a deeper understanding of the supreme value of the great friendship of the Soviet Union. The Chinese people must always, with unremitting efforts, continuously strengthen the close friendly alliances and comprehensive cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. I am equally convinced that the unbreakable alliance and cooperation of our two great countries not only fully conform to the interests of the two peoples, but also play an unparalleled and significant role in consolidating the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and in safeguarding the cause of peace and security in the Far East and the world.

    Comrade Ambassador, I warmly welcome you to take office as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentary of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to the People's Republic of China. In your work to consolidate the friendly and mutually beneficial cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, you will receive the full support of myself and the Government of the People's Republic of China.

    I wish you complete success in your work.
