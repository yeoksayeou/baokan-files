Workers in Factories, Mines, and Construction Enterprises Throughout the Country
Launch a High Tide of Studying the General Line
Striving to Overfulfill Annual Plans
Throughout the country, workers in factories, mines, and construction enterprises have launched a high tide of studying the state's general line. Many enterprise Party committee secretaries have delivered reports to workers on the general line. Currently, in Tianjin, more than 100,000 workers in state-owned and local state-owned factories have received education on the state's general line for the transition period. In Shanghai, the broad masses of workers have universally launched studies of the general line; railway workers alone have had over 12,000 people listen to reports. In Qingdao, over 21,000 cadres from factories, enterprises, and other units citywide have listened to reports. In Chengdu, after a week of propaganda in 33 state-owned, local state-owned, joint state-private, and private factories and construction sites, the broad masses of workers have enthusiastically launched studies and discussions. In Nanjing, over 4,000 people from the Construction Engineering Company have listened to reports. In the Zibo area of Shandong, over 13,000 workers and staff from industrial and mining enterprises have listened to reports. The Yumen Oil Mine has designated over ten part-time reporters to regularly deliver reports to workers by district. In Shenyang, under the leadership of the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee, active propaganda and education on the general line has been carried out among the broad masses of private enterprise workers. In Tianjin, over 100,000 workers in private factories have also universally launched studies and discussions.

After listening to reports on the state's general line for the transition period, thousands upon thousands of workers, staff members, and technicians were all overjoyed. Everyone recognizes the glory of their work and the importance of their tasks. Zhao Peishan, an old worker at the Nanjing Chemical Plant, said, "This really makes me happy! I am now contributing to the construction of socialism." Qin Yongfu, a worker at the Dalian Machine Tool Plant, said, "Only when the country is industrialized can socialism be realized. How quickly we industrialize depends on the efforts of the entire nation, especially our working class. The machine tools our factory produces are the foundation of industry, so our responsibility is even greater. We must work even harder to reduce defective products, increase output, overfulfill state plans, and strive to achieve socialism as soon as possible." Sui Zhendou, a cadre at the Qingdao Shiye Printing Plant, said: "In the past, I thought working in local industry was not promising. After listening to the report, I realized that our local industry must both guarantee the needs of the people and accumulate funds for national industrialization. Our responsibility is very heavy, and I will definitely do my job well in the future." Liu Yuzhen, a female worker at the Tianjin Weidishi Pharmaceutical Factory, said: "In the past, I always felt that working in a private enterprise had no future, but now I know that working in a private factory not only requires us to do a good job in production, but also to urge capitalists to carry out socialist transformation. The responsibility is extremely important."

The light of the general line shines on the lines of industrial production and basic construction, and a new atmosphere has emerged everywhere. Since starting the study of the general line, the production volume of the nitration workshop workers at the Nanjing Chemical Plant has gradually increased. By November 23, they had completed the November production task ahead of schedule. After listening to the report, the workers of the coal tipping group at the Yingcheng Coal Mine revised their production plan and improved their work efficiency. In the past, it took an hour to tip a car, but now it only takes 40 minutes. The Shi Changdong group in the basic construction workshop of the Baoding Power Plant had been unable to complete the production plan for a long time. After the workers studied the general line, they increased their strength to overcome difficulties. They used their brains and repeatedly pondered, and finally used electric drills and discarded grinding wheels to replace manual work and steel files, increasing work efficiency by more than 18 times. This will save 1,600 man-hours and 240 steel files in the installation of generators. After listening to the report, the workers of the steelmaking department of the Tangshan Steel Plant immediately studied and improved the quality of steel ingots. The Zhang Hanwen group studied adding aluminum according to the level of residual manganese, and the first-grade product reached more than 92%. Workers from 21 factories in Zhangjiakou City have formulated specific progress plans for overfulfilling state plans and increasing production and practicing economy. Currently, workers in various enterprises are striving to complete and overfulfill their annual plans.

    各地工厂矿山和建筑企业职工
    掀起学习总路线的热潮
    正为超额完成全年计划而奋斗
    全国各地工厂、矿山和建筑企业职工，掀起了学习国家总路线的热潮。许多企业党委会书记向职工作了关于总路线的传达报告。目前，天津市国营和地方国营工厂已有十多万职工受到了国家过渡时期总路线的教育。上海市广大职工普遍展开了总路线的学习，仅铁路职工已有一万二千多人听了报告。青岛全市工厂企业等单位干部已有二万一千多人听了报告。成都市三十三个国营、地方国营、公私合营、私营工厂和建筑工地经过一周宣传，广大职工已热烈展开学习讨论。南京市建筑工程公司已有四千多人听了报告。山东淄博地区工矿企业职工已有一万三千余人听了报告。玉门油矿确定了十多个兼职报告员，分区定期向职工作报告。沈阳市各区在中共沈阳市委领导下，已积极向广大私营企业职工展开总路线的宣传教育。天津市私营工厂职工十余万人，也普遍展开了学习和讨论。
    千千万万的工人、职员和技术人员听了国家过渡时期总路线的报告后，个个欢欣鼓舞。大家都认识到自己工作的光荣和任务的重大。南京化工厂老工人赵佩珊说：“这真叫我高兴呀！我现在就是在为建设社会主义出力了。”大连机床厂工人秦永福说：“只有国家工业化了才能实现社会主义。多会工业化还要看全国人民特别是咱们工人阶级的努力。咱厂生产的机床是工业的基础，所以咱们的责任更大。咱们要更加劲减少废品，提高产量，超额完成国家计划，争取早日实现社会主义。”青岛实业印刷厂干部隋振都说：过去认为在地方工业中工作没啥出息，听了报告以后认识到我们地方工业既要保证人民的需要，又要为国家工业化积累资金，责任是很重大的，今后我一定安心做好自己的工作。天津私营伟迪氏制药厂女工刘玉珍说：过去总觉得在私营企业做工没前途，现在才知道在私营厂子干活不但要搞好生产，还要督促资本家进行社会主义改造，责任非常重大。
    总路线的光芒照耀在工业生产和基本建设线上，到处出现了新的气象。南京化工厂硝化车间工人从总路线的学习开始后，生产量就逐步提高。到十一月二十三日，他们就提前完成了十一月份生产任务。营城煤矿选运翻车小组工人听了报告后，修订了生产计划，提高了工作效率，过去翻一蹚蹅车得一小时，现在只用四十分钟。保定发电厂基本建设车间的史常东小组，长期不能完成生产计划。工人们学习了总路线后，增加了战胜困难的力量。他们开动脑筋，反复琢磨，最后用电钻、废砂轮，代替了手工和钢锉，工作效率提高十八倍多。这样一来就能在安装发电机中节省一千六百个人工和二百四十把钢锉。唐山钢厂炼钢部工人听了报告以后，立即研究改进钢锭的质量。张汉文小组研究出按余锰的高低加铝，一级品达到了百分之九十二以上。张家口市有二十一个工厂的职工，订出了超额完成国家计划和增产节约计划的具体进度计划。目前各企业职工正为完成和超额完成全年计划而奋斗。
