Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 15th: Our special correspondent reports: U.S. representative Dean departed for the United States today – three days after he suspended the negotiations. It is believed here that this is another pre-determined step by the U.S. side to shut the door on resuming bilateral talks on the issue of a political conference. Dean came to Panmunjom yesterday to announce to reporters his plan to leave for the United States today, further pushing the already stalled talks off the cliff. This clearly shows that Dean's so-called remarks that he is waiting for the talks to resume are only intended to deceive the world. Dean's instruction to his advisor, Kenneth Young, to stay in Korea for a few more days does not change the fact that the U.S. representative has abandoned the talks.

　　Korean-Chinese side representatives Qi Shi-fu and Huang Hua issued a joint statement on the evening of the 14th, stating that the Korean-Chinese side advocates continuing bilateral talks. Their statement pointed out: "Whether the U.S. government is willing to bear the serious responsibility for sabotaging the convening of the political conference, or return to Panmunjom to continue bilateral talks, is a choice it should make itself." In addition to the statement, the Korean-Chinese representatives attached a letter notifying Dean to come to Panmunjom for a meeting at the usual time this morning. The letter was delivered to the U.S. side at 4:25 this morning, asking them to forward it to Dean. Dean's answer was to depart for the United States.

　　Observers who have been closely following the armistice negotiations clearly see that the policy implemented by Dean is nothing more than the policy that U.S. representatives Joy and Harrison wanted to implement in the past during the armistice negotiations, but had to temporarily put aside in the face of world opinion, which is a policy of seriously undermining the hope of the world's people for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. The U.S. government never wanted to hold a political conference, and never wanted to peacefully resolve the Korean issue.

　　As early as February last year, Vice Admiral Joy publicly stated that, as far as the U.S. representatives were concerned, what they hoped for was only a military armistice in Korea, and they believed that it was unnecessary to suggest to the relevant governments to definitely hold a political conference to achieve peace in Korea. Under public pressure, Joy was forced to agree to Article 60 of the armistice agreement regarding the holding of a political conference to ensure a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. However, Dean's current action of abandoning the talks on convening a political conference tears up this article of the armistice agreement.

　　Harrison also delayed the signing of the armistice agreement for weeks. He insisted that the political conference could not resolve the final disposition of non-directly repatriated prisoners of war under the supervision of neutral nations. Dean has now shattered the hope of convening a political conference, realizing Harrison's previous statement.

　　Under public condemnation, Harrison was once forced to assure General Nam Il before signing the armistice agreement that the Syngman Rhee government would implement the armistice agreement. However, Dean is now leaving for the United States, opening the door for Syngman Rhee to realize his conspiracy to sabotage the armistice. Not only that, before Dean left for the United States, he publicly claimed that he would use the military to support Syngman Rhee's conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war and sabotage the armistice agreement, thereby nullifying all the guarantees Harrison made to General Nam Il.

　　On the day he suspended the talks, Dean made an ominous speech. He said: "President Rhee and I are in complete agreement on this whole issue of Korean unification and the political conference." This self-confessed remark of admitting that the United States and Syngman Rhee were colluding with each other has been included in the minutes of the last meeting. The day before he suspended the talks, Dean told reporters that he had reached an agreement with Syngman Rhee on the future course of the talks.

　　Until the last day of the talks, Dean consistently avoided discussing whether the agreement reached by both parties was binding on the Syngman Rhee government. One of the provisions in the "final" proposal that Dean used indefinite adjournment to coerce the Korean-Chinese representatives to sign stipulated that the Syngman Rhee government could tear up any agreement. This conspiratorial clause is: "Each government participating in the political conference is only bound by the specific agreement in which it participates."

　　What is the consensus reached between Dean and Syngman Rhee on the issue of Korean unification and the political conference? The answer can be found in the statements made by Syngman Rhee to the world, and in the gradual unfolding of Syngman Rhee's conspiracy to unify Korea by force. Syngman Rhee has openly expressed absolute opposition to the Korean armistice and peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. He threatened that he would "advance north to the Yalu River" six months after the armistice, and would unilaterally "release" prisoners of war by force "if necessary". Dean's blatant statement proves that the U.S. government should bear full responsibility for the Syngman Rhee government's treacherous acts of seizing prisoners of war and sabotaging the armistice.

　　It is now clear that before the U.S. side suspended bilateral talks, it used both deception and pressure to force its "allies" to follow the U.S.'s destructive policy. Now the U.S. government is trying its best to conceal the seriousness of the Korean situation from these hesitant "allies", attempting to drag them step by step into the cesspool of the "cold war". The U.S. State Department yesterday specifically deceived these "allies" again, saying that Dean only "suspended" the talks, and did not "terminate" them. Now is the time for these countries to wake up, otherwise, when they find that they have been tied to the chariot of the United States and Syngman Rhee, it will be too late to regret.

### 迪安跑回美国企图关死恢复会谈的大门  证明美国政府从来也不想举行政治会议

    迪安跑回美国企图关死恢复会谈的大门
    证明美国政府从来也不想举行政治会议
    【新华社开城十五日电】本社特派记者报道：美方代表迪安在今天——他中断谈判之后三天——动身返美。此间认为，这是美方把恢复关于政治会议问题的双方会谈的大门关死的另一预定步骤。迪安在昨天到板门店来向新闻记者宣布他计划在今天动身返美，从而进一步把已经停顿的会谈推下悬崖。这清楚地说明，迪安的所谓他正在等待会谈恢复的言论，其目的只是要一手掩盖天下人的耳目。迪安叫他的顾问肯尼思·杨格在朝鲜留几天，这并不能改变美国代表已经把会谈弃置不顾的事实。
    朝中方面的代表奇石福和黄华在十四日晚发表联合声明说，朝中方面是主张继续双方会谈的。他们的声明指出：“美国政府究竟是甘愿担当破坏政治会议召开的严重责任，还是回到板门店来继续举行双方会谈，应由它自己选择。”朝中代表在声明之外并附去一信，通知迪安在今天上午平常时间前来板门店开会。信件已在今天上午四时二十五分交给美方，请他们转交给迪安。迪安的回答是动身返美。
    曾经密切注意停战谈判的观察家看得很清楚，迪安所执行的政策，只不过是美国代表乔埃和哈利逊过去在停战谈判中所想要执行、但在世界舆论的面前又不得不暂时搁在一边的政策，也就是美国政府给世界人民对和平解决朝鲜问题所抱的希望以严重打击的政策。美国政府从来也不想举行政治会议，从来也不想和平解决朝鲜问题。
    早在去年二月，乔埃海军中将就公开说，就美方代表而论，他们所希望的只是在朝鲜实现军事停战，他们认为向有关政府建议肯定地举行政治会议以实现朝鲜和平是不必要的。在公众压力之下，乔埃被迫同意了停战协定中关于举行政治会议以保证和平解决朝鲜问题的第六十款。但是，迪安现在这种把召开政治会议的会谈弃置不顾的行动，却撕毁了停战协定的这一款。
    哈利逊也曾经拖延停战协定的签订达数周之久。他坚持说，政治会议不能解决在中立国看管之下的不直接遣返战俘的最后处置问题。迪安现在打破了召开政治会议的希望，实现了哈利逊的前言。
    在公众的谴责之下，哈利逊曾经被迫在停战协定签字之前向南日大将保证，李承晚政府将执行停战协定。但是，迪安现在却动身返美，给李承晚实现破坏停战的阴谋打开了大门。不但如此，迪安在他返美以前还公然声称要用军队来策应李承晚强迫扣留战俘、破坏停战协定的阴谋，从而将哈利逊向南日大将提出的所有保证都一笔勾销。
    就在他中断会谈的那一天，迪安发表过一篇不祥的谈话。他说：“李总统和我在这个朝鲜统一和政治会议的整个问题上，意见完全一致。”这种供认美国和李承晚串通一气的不打自招的言论，已列入最后一次会议的记录。就在他中断会谈前一天，迪安对新闻记者说，他已和李承晚在会谈的未来进程上达成协议。
    一直到会谈的最后一天，迪安始终避而不谈双方达成的协议对李承晚政府是否具有约束力这个问题。迪安以无限期休会来胁迫朝中代表在上面签字的“最后”建议中，就有一条规定使李承晚政府可以撕毁任何协议。这条阴谋的条款就是：“每一参加政治会议的政府仅受它所参与的特定的协议的约束。”
    迪安和李承晚在朝鲜统一和政治会议问题上取得的一致意见是什么呢？这个答案可以从李承晚向全世界发表的声明，以及李承晚以武力统一朝鲜的阴谋的逐步展开中找到答案。李承晚是公开表示绝对反对朝鲜停战及和平解决朝鲜问题的。他扬言他要在停战六个月以后，“向北推进到鸭绿江边”，并且“必要时”将片面地以武力“释放”战俘。迪安的露骨的声明证明美国政府对李承晚政府劫夺战俘和破坏停战的背信弃义的行为应该负全部责任。
    现在已经可以看得很清楚，美方在中断双方会谈之前，曾经以欺诈和压力兼施的手段，迫使它的“盟国”追随美国的破坏政策。现在美国政府正在竭力向这些疑惧不定的“盟国”掩盖朝鲜局势的严重性，企图一步一步地把它们拖下“冷战”的臭水坑。美国国务院昨天特地再度欺骗这些“盟国”说，迪安只是“中断”会谈，并没有“终止”。现在是这些国家醒过来的时候了，否则的话，等到它们发现自己已经被缚在美国和李承晚的战车上的时候，就后悔莫及了。
