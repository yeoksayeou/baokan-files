    I Suffered Because I Didn't Listen to the Communist Party
    Zhao Kaiyuan speaking
    My name is Zhao Kaiyuan, I am sixty-one years old this year, and I am from Ji's Village, Second District, Jiaocheng, Shanxi. I planted more than thirty *mu* of land, and the harvest was pretty good this year, yielding thirty-two bags of grain, which made the whole family happy. The children all said to me: "Dad! The state is buying grain now! Sell our surplus grain to the supply and marketing cooperative in our village and sew us some new clothes to wear!" At the time, I thought what the children said made sense, it was getting cold! I should get them a few pieces of clothing. After a rough estimate, I was planning to sell three hundred *jin* of mung beans to exchange for some cloth.

    At that time, the supply and marketing cooperative posted grain prices: "Medium-grade mung beans 990 yuan per *jin*," and district and township cadres also promoted things like "Selling surplus grain to the state prevents exploitation by speculative merchants..." After hearing such propaganda, I thought to myself: The price of grain is probably going to rise! Maybe I should wait a few days. I also thought that the grain price in our small mountain village is set too low, I should sell it in the city to get a better price. Ah! My old brain took this wrong idea.

      One morning, my son discussed with me about selling the grain to the supply and marketing cooperative. Not only did I disagree, but I also criticized him. I said, "Look at the situation, there are many people selling grain. If we wait a few days and the price rises and we sell it in the city, won't we be able to sell it for tens of thousands more yuan? You're such a reckless ghost!" He wanted to sell it, but I didn't want to, and my son and I argued about it. But the little legs can't beat the big legs, because I am in charge at home, and in the end he left in a huff. Two days later, the villagers found out about our father and son's quarrel. When I went to the street, some people advised me to sell it to the supply and marketing cooperative; but some older people like me agreed to let me go to the city. A day later, I met Wang Shiying, the militia clerk of our village, who advised me to sell it to the supply and marketing cooperative. He said: "Uncle Zhao! The grain price will not rise! Our acquisition of grain is to stabilize market prices and support industrial construction. You sell your three hundred *jin* of mung beans to the supply and marketing cooperative, and if you send another three hundred *jin* from the supply and marketing cooperative to the city, you can earn 60,000 yuan in travel expenses in one trip. Wouldn't that be killing two birds with one stone!" Although he said that, I was afraid that the cadres were coaxing me, and I was determined to sell it in the city. And I said to Wang Shiying: "I would rather die in Jiaocheng!" He ignored me and walked away.

    The next morning, after eating a mouthful of food, my wife helped me load three hundred *jin* of mung beans on the donkey's back, and I went straight to the city. My village is a hundred *li* away from the city, and it took me a whole day to get there. The next day was a market day, so I moved the grain to the market and started asking about prices. I originally wanted to sell it for more money, but I ran around to several places, and they all had the same price. I waited until the afternoon, and it was still the same price. At this time, I began to feel embarrassed. Should I sell it? Or should I wait another day? I'll wait! I waited until the next day, and it was still the same price, neither falling nor rising. I stayed for three days, spent a lot on hotel expenses, and estimated that the autumn plowing at home, anyway, I couldn't wait for a high price, so I had to sell it in the end. I sold the grain, took the money, bought some blue and white cloth, and went back.

    I wasted four days in the city back and forth, and my legs ached from running all the way. After I came back, my son saw that I was unhappy and didn't say much to me. This time he was really unhappy. At home, I thought about what Wang Shiying had advised me before, and calculated the bill. Not to mention the suffering, I lost a total of 35,000 yuan on travel expenses. That's not all, the cloth I bought back was almost the same price as the cloth from the supply and marketing cooperative, but the material was much worse! The director of the supply and marketing cooperative asked me: "Did you buy it from the cooperative?" I thought, no, I bought it from a private individual. Everyone laughed, and my face turned red. Sure enough, I suffered again. Furthermore, the people in the village, some of them were laughing at me. The people who were waiting for high prices like me were: as soon as they saw that I had suffered, they were relieved! A neighbor named Kang Youji sold more than three hundred *jin* of grain to the supply and marketing cooperative the next day, and other families stopped going to the city!

    Why did I suffer? The main reason is that I didn't listen to the Communist Party, didn't believe in the state's grain prices, and wanted to wait for high prices, so I had to suffer. Now is the time when the state is buying grain, and I advise everyone not to follow my original approach. (Recorded by Yan Juqian and Xing Yongwei)

### 我不听共产党的话吃了亏

    我不听共产党的话吃了亏
    赵开元  说
    我老汉叫赵开元，今年六十一岁，是山西交城二区姬家庄人。种的三十多垧地，今年收成还不错，打了粮食三十二口袋，全家人都高兴。孩子们都对我说：“爹！现在国家收购粮食哩！把咱的余粮卖给咱村供销社，给我们缝上一身新衣裳穿！”当时我觉得孩子们说得对，天也冷啦！应该给孩子们穿上几件。粗粗的估计了一下，准备要粜绿豆三百斤，换些布来。
    当时，供销社挂出了粮食牌价：“中等绿豆每斤九百九十元”，区、乡干部也宣传什么“余粮卖给国家，防止投机商人剥削……”。听了这样宣传后，我心里想：大概粮食价钱要涨啦！甚不甚等上几天再说。又想咱这山庄小村，粮价定的太低，要卖也城里去，好来落它个好价钱。啊！老脑筋就拿了这套错主意。
      一天早晨，我儿子和我商量，要我把粮食粜到供销社。我不只不同意，还把他批评了一气。我说：“你看这局势，卖粮的人很多，等上几天涨了价卖到城里，可不是能多卖几万元吗？真是冒失鬼！”他要粜，我不粜，俺父子俩为此还顶了一气嘴。但是小腿总拗不过大腿，因为家里是我主事，最后他别气走了。过了两天，俺父子们吵架的事被村里人都知道了。我到街上，有的人就劝我还是卖给供销社好；但有一些和我一样的老年人，他们也同意让我去城里一趟。又过了一天，遇上我村民兵文书王世英，他劝我卖到供销社，他说：“赵大爷！粮价是不会涨的！咱们收购粮食，就是为的稳定市场物价，支援工业建设，你把你的三百斤绿豆卖到供销社，要是你再给供销社往城里送三百斤，一回还能赚脚价六万元，这样，不是一举两得的事情吗！”他虽然这样说，我怕是干部哄我，还是拿定主意进城卖。并对王世英说：“死也要死在交城哩！”人家没理我就走开了。
    第二天一早，吃了口饭，我老婆帮我把三百斤绿豆抬到驴背上，就一直往城里走。我村离城有一百里远，紧紧走了一天才到了。第二天正赶上赶集，我就把粮食搬到市场上，开始访问价格，我心里本来想多卖些钱，但是一直跑了几处，都是一个牌价。一直等到下午，还是那一样价。这时我就开始作难起来，该卖呢？还是再等上一天呢？等吧！直等到第二天，还是那一样价，没落也没涨。共住了三天，店钱花了不少，心里又估计家里的秋翻地，反正等不上高价，最后只好卖了。卖了粮拿上钱又买了些青白布，就往回走。
    前前后后在城里误了四天，一路子跑得两腿直痛。回来以后，我儿子看见我不高兴，也没和我多说，这一次实在不乐意。我在家里，又把王世英原来劝我的那一段话，想了一遍，算了算账，光受罪不说，连盘费总的吃亏三万五千元。这还不算，买回的布，和供销社的布一比，价钱倒是差不多，材料和人家差得可远哩！供销社主任问我：“从合作社里买的吗？”我一想，不是，从私人家买的。大家一笑，我的脸也红了，可不，这又吃了亏了。再说村里的人，一部分人是笑我，原来和我一样等高价的人是：一见我吃了亏他们也就死心踏地啦！一个邻家叫康有吉的，第二天就把三百多斤粮，卖给了供销社，别人家也就不再到城里去啦！
    为什么我要吃亏哩？主要是怨我不听共产党的话，不相信国家的粮食价格，又想等高价，所以就要吃亏，现在正在国家收购粮食的时候，我劝大家绝不要跟我原来的做法走。（燕居谦、邢永为记）
