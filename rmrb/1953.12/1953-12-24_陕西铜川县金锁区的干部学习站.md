    The Cadre Study Station in Jin Suo District, Tongchuan County, Shaanxi
    The Propaganda Department of the CCP Tongchuan County Committee, Shaanxi

    Jin Suo District in Tongchuan County, Shaanxi Province, covers approximately 56 *li*, entirely mountainous terrain. Within this extensive area, there are only seven *xiang* and forty-five district and *xiang* cadres. These cadres frequently conduct central tasks in the rural areas, with each district cadre responsible for the work of five or six villages. Given the vastness of the region and the dispersion of cadres, learning has always been difficult to conduct smoothly. Moreover, cadres have low levels of education (most have a primary school education or are completely illiterate), have a poor understanding ability, lack independent learning habits, and rely on the old-fashioned method of "one person reads, everyone listens." Consequently, they often forgo learning due to being preoccupied with work. Although the district Party committee has repeatedly emphasized that "work cannot be done without learning" and stipulated a daily two-hour learning system, learning remains in a state of fluctuation. The higher-ups push, and the lower-downs move, sometimes not even moving when pushed. Furthermore, a few cadres with a certain level of education are arrogant and complacent, feeling that collective learning is not effective and prefer self-study. However, they do not follow the regulations in their self-study, learning whatever catches their attention. As a result, cadres do not learn well, their political awareness cannot gradually improve, and some even become passive. For example, at the end of 1951, three of the six *xiang* Party branch secretaries wanted to quit their jobs. Because of poor learning, cadres' work methods cannot be improved, affecting the implementation of the Party's policies and even turning good things into bad ones.

    The district Party committee realized this was a major problem and began to address it.

    In early 1952, the district launched a Party rectification campaign. At that time, in addition to Party rectification, there was also winter production and the establishment of a propaganda network, and cadre learning was also one of the district committee's important tasks. If so many tasks were grasped haphazardly, none would be done well, let alone cadre learning. Wei Chunxue, the district Party secretary at the time, raised this issue at the district committee meeting. The meeting decided to establish a cadre study station to lecture Party members, Communist Youth League members, activists, and propagandists, while also inviting district and *xiang* cadres to attend the lectures. The first lecture was given in February of that year by District Party Secretary Wei Chunxue and two other comrades on the nature of the Party. After the report, discussions were held in each *xiang*. This report did play a significant role in improving the political awareness of cadres. Wang Faxin, the Party branch secretary of the Fifth *xiang*, who originally wanted to quit his job and return home, dispelled the idea after listening to the report and participating in the discussion. Han Yufeng, the Party branch secretary of the Seventh *xiang*, resolved to dedicate his life to the revolution. With cadres focusing on their work, the district's spring plowing and drought prevention efforts were enthusiastically launched.

    The first shot was fired successfully. The district committee attached great importance to the organizational form of the study station and strengthened its leadership. The study station has been operating ever since. Over the past year, the district committee has given twenty-one reports to the three study stations. The content of the lectures has been closely linked to the situation and tasks. For example, during Party rectification, basic knowledge of the Party was taught. During the patriotic health campaign, the principles of "opposing bacteriological warfare" were explained. After the Korean armistice, lectures were given on "The First Step in Peaceful Resolution of the Korean Question." After the Party Central Committee issued the "Resolution on Agricultural Production Mutual Aid and Cooperation," the text of the resolution and "The Direction of Rural Economic Development After Land Reform" were explained. In addition, everyone studied documents such as autumn harvest and planting, grain procurement, and the general election. Learning methods have also been continuously improved. Initially, cadres only listened to lectures and did not discuss. Now, after each lecture, cadres take discussion questions back to prepare, and the lecturer facilitates the discussion next time.

    Facts tell us that because the study station has a fixed location and instructors, it can enable cadres to gather and learn on time, effectively solving the shortcomings of district and *xiang* cadres being dispersed, highly mobile, with low cultural and political levels, making self-study difficult, and leading to lax learning systems and difficulty in conducting learning effectively. Therefore, it is a good way to organize the learning of district and *xiang* cadres. Specifically, the benefits of the study station are as follows:

    1. It can make the learning of district and *xiang* cadres regular. The study station is organized by cadres from two or three neighboring *xiang*. Jin Suo District has established a total of three stations, directly led by the district committee. They gather once every half month to twenty days for lectures and discussions, which basically solves the difficulties in leadership, time, teachers, and learning methods in the learning of district and *xiang* cadres, enabling cadres to engage in regular learning.

    2. It can help cadres understand the current situation and policies in a timely manner, enabling them to educate the masses on current affairs and policies at any time. For example, in the spring of 1952, American imperialism spread germs everywhere in an attempt to reverse the failure of the war of aggression against Korea. Zhang Zhongxin, the district committee secretary of the Communist Youth League, was working in the countryside. Because he could not see newspapers, he was afraid to conduct propaganda among the masses. Later, after listening to the report on opposing bacteriological warfare at the study station, his mind was clear, and he had something to say to the masses. At the beginning of this year's grain purchase work, cadres could only conduct general propaganda among the masses, not understanding how to do this work. After the study station organized everyone to learn about grain procurement, cadres understood the law of farmers selling for the purpose of buying. Wang Yucai, the Party branch secretary of the Second *xiang*, and others specifically helped the masses establish household plans and purchase livestock and agricultural implements to expand reproduction and improve their lives. As a result, the Second *xiang* alone bought back twenty-six head of livestock and multiple pieces of agricultural implements such as chaff cutters, plows, and shares, and built twelve new houses. At the same time, they promoted farmers to sell more than 93,100 *jin* of surplus grain to the state. Therefore, comrades believe that the study station is very helpful in solving their problems. Someone composed a *kuaiban* [clapper talk] saying: "With the study station, learning has changed. Listen to lectures and discuss, learn a lot. Go to the countryside to work, come back to talk."

    3. It has initially promoted the cultural learning of cadres. Since the establishment of the study station, many comrades have gradually cultivated learning habits and interests, and learning has become a trend in Jin Suo District. Cadres are now beginning to realize that they cannot work well if they do not learn well. Originally, the seven *xiang* did not have a single newspaper; now, every *xiang* has a newspaper. Zhang Zhenjiang, the clerk of the First *xiang*, reads every newspaper thoroughly every day and marks important places with a red pen. With cadres working hard to learn becoming the norm, illiterate cadres unanimously feel that it is very difficult to work without culture. They want to be able to take notes during lectures and answer questions on tests like other comrades, so they consciously and actively learn culture. Lin Changxiang, the *xiang* head of the Sixth *xiang*, does not know many characters. He bought a book of common characters and asked Yang Zhibang, the clerk, to teach him. Chen Shengyu, the organization member of the district committee, always has a book in his hand and asks people about unfamiliar characters. Liu Zhenhua, the district farmers' association cadre, feels that his writing is not skilled and cannot take notes during lectures, so he practices writing every day. Since the establishment of the study station more than a year ago, some illiterate cadres have gone from not knowing a single character to being able to read popular books and newspapers. As long as we strengthen leadership and adhere to this learning system, we can partially solve the cultural learning problems of district and *xiang* cadres.

    After more than a year of exploration and research, we have gained some experience in leading the study station, which is:

    1. The study station must be directly led by the district committee, with a dedicated person (the district committee's propaganda member) in charge. A plan should be drawn up to organize everyone to learn on a regular basis. The head of the study station should be the Party branch secretary of the *xiang* where it is located, responsible for administrative work, managing cadre accommodation, meals, and water. The learning time, like in Jin Suo District, a mountainous area, should be once every twenty days, arriving the afternoon before, reporting and studying work in the evening, and dedicating the next day to learning.

    2. Lecturers must be the district Party secretary, the district head, and the ministers of the county committee and the section chiefs of the county people's government who come to the countryside. Because these people have stronger lecturing abilities, they can increase the interest of cadres in learning. In order to ensure the quality of teaching and help district-level leading comrades solve the difficulty of preparing lessons, the county party committee's propaganda department must provide lecture outlines. Tongchuan County did this, and the lecturing comrades were very welcoming. The responsible comrades of the district said: As long as you regularly solve the problem of outlines for us, we will have the confidence to run the study station well.

    3. The learning situation of cadres should be checked in a timely manner. Since its establishment, the study station in Jin Suo District has checked learning notes twice and held five tests, which has powerfully urged cadres to learn.

    The work of the Jin Suo District Cadre Study Station still has some shortcomings, such as not having a thorough plan, which sometimes prevents reports and discussions from being conducted as scheduled; many cadres only listen to lectures and do not pay attention to learning at ordinary times; absorbing rural cadres and activists who do not leave production to participate in learning has affected their production. The district committee is gradually solving these problems. Recently, the district committee has formulated a learning plan and assigned the work team leaders (district cadres) in each *xiang* to serve as learning tutors to solve the difficulties in cadre learning. The people participating in the study station are also gradually becoming mainly cadres who have left production. In addition, the district committee is also studying how to further improve the cultural learning of cadres so that the political awareness, working ability, and cultural level of cadres can be continuously improved.

    陕西铜川县金锁区的干部学习站
    中共陕西铜川县委宣传部
    陕西铜川县金锁区，方圆约有五十六里，全是山地。在这样大的地区里，仅有七个乡、四十五名区、乡干部。这些区、乡干部，经常在乡下做中心工作，就这样，一个区干部还得掌握五、六个村的工作。地方这样大，干部这样分散，学习本来就很难顺利进行；加上干部文化水平低（大多数是初小以下程度或根本不识字），理解能力较差，没有独立学习的习惯，学习方法也总是老一套的“一人念，众人听”，因此，往往因为忙于工作挤掉了学习。虽然党的区委会常强调“不学习就不能工作”，规定每天必须坚持两小时的学习制度，但学习始终处于忽冷忽热的状态中。上边一推，下边一动，有时候甚至推也推不动。而少数有一定文化水平的干部，则骄傲自满，觉得集体学习不得劲，不如自学。他们自学却又不按照规定，抓住啥学啥。这样，干部学习不好，政治觉悟程度就不能逐步提高，有的甚至消极起来。例如在一九五一年底，六个乡的党支部书记就有三个人想脱离工作。因为学习不好，干部的工作方法也不能很好地改进，影响了党的政策的贯彻执行，甚至把好事办成坏事。
    党的区委会觉得这是一个很大的问题，就着手来解决它。
    一九五二年初，全区开始了整党工作。当时，除了整党以外，还有冬季生产和建立宣传网等等工作，干部学习也是区委会的重要工作之一。这么多的工作，如果乱抓的话，那末，一样都不会作好的，干部的学习更不用说了。当时的区委书记魏纯学就把这个问题提到区委会上研究。会上决定成立干部学习站，给党员、团员和积极分子、宣传员讲课，同时，吸收区、乡干部都来听课。第一次讲课是在这一年的二月，由区委书记魏纯学等三同志作了关于党的性质的报告。报告后分乡讨论。这次报告，对于提高干部的政治觉悟程度确实起了很大的作用。五乡支部书记王发新原来想脱离工作回家的，但听了报告，参加了讨论，把这个念头打消了；七乡支部书记韩玉峰决心革命一辈子。由于干部工作安心，使全区春耕防旱工作热烈地开展起来。
    第一炮打响了。区委会很重视学习站这种组织形式，加强了对它的领导。学习站便一直办到现在。一年多以来，区委会曾分别向三个学习站作了二十一次报告。讲授的内容，都是和形势、任务密切联系的。例如在整党时讲授了党的基本知识，在开展爱国卫生运动时讲解了“反对细菌战”的道理，朝鲜停战后以“和平解决朝鲜问题的第一步”为题，进行了讲授。党中央发布了关于农业生产互助合作的决议以后，便讲解了决议本文及“土地改革后农村经济的发展方向”。此外，还组织大家学习过秋收秋播、收购粮食、普选等文件。在学习方法上也不断地有所改进。最初干部们只听讲，不讨论；现在，在每次讲授完毕后，干部们就带上讨论题回去准备，下次由讲课人主持讨论。
    事实告诉我们，由于学习站有固定地点，并有人讲授，能够使干部按时集中学习，可以有效地解决区、乡干部分散，流动性大，文化、政治水平低，进行自学有困难，以至由此产生的学习制度松懈，不易搞好学习的缺点，所以它是组织区、乡干部学习的一种好办法。具体说来，学习站的好处有下列三点：
    一、可以使区、乡干部的学习经常化。学习站是由两、三个邻近乡的干部组织起来的，金锁区总共建立了三个站，都由区委会直接领导，半月到二十天集中一次来进行讲授、讨论，这就基本上解决了在区、乡干部学习中存在着的领导、时间、教员、学习方法等困难问题，使干部能进行经常的学习。
    二、能够帮助干部及时了解当前的形势和政策，使他们能够随时向群众进行时事政策教育。比方说，一九五二年春天，美帝国主义到处撒布细菌，企图挽回侵朝战争的败局。青年团区委会干事张忠信在农村工作，因为看不到报纸，不敢向群众进行宣传；后来在学习站听了关于反对细菌战的报告，心里亮了，对群众有啥说的了。今年购粮工作开始时，干部只能向群众进行泛泛的宣传，不明白这个工作到底如何做；自从学习站组织大家进行了关于收购粮食的学习以后，干部明白了农民为买而卖的规律，二乡党支部书记王玉财等便具体帮助群众建立家务，购买牲口、农具来扩大再生产，改善生活。这样做的结果，仅二乡就买回牲口二十六头，还有铡、犁、铧等农具多件，并新盖房子十二间。与此同时，推动农民向国家出售余粮九万三千一百多斤。因此，同志们都认为学习站很能帮助自己解决问题。有人给编了一个快板是：“有了学习站，学习有改变。听讲加讨论，学下一大串。下乡有作的，回来有说的。”
    三、初步推动了干部的文化学习。自从成立了学习站，许多同志逐渐地培养起了学习的习惯和兴趣，学习在金锁区成了风气。干部们现在开始体会到：不能很好地学习，就不能很好地工作。原来七个乡没有一份报纸，现在乡乡都有报纸了。一乡文书张振江，每天来了报纸就齐齐地看一遍，还用红笔圈点重要的地方。在干部努力学习已经形成风气的情况下，文盲干部一致感到：没有文化，作工作困难很大，他们很想和其他同志一样，听课能记笔记，测验能答卷子，所以都自觉地积极学文化。六乡乡长林长祥识字不多，他买了一本日用杂字，叫文书杨治邦教给他；区委会组织委员陈生玉成天手不离书，碰上生字，见人就问；区农会干事刘振华觉得写字不熟练，听课记不上笔记，就天天练习写字。学习站成立一年多以来，有些文盲干部已经由一字不识到能看通俗书报了。只要我们加强领导，把这种学习制度坚持下去，就可以部分地解决区、乡干部的文化学习问题。
    经过一年多来的摸索、研究，我们取得了一些领导学习站的经验，这就是：
    一、学习站必须由区委会直接领导，专人（区委会宣传委员）负责。要订出计划，按期组织大家学习。学习站站长应由所在乡的支部书记担任，负责事务工作，管理干部住宿、吃饭、喝水。学习时间，像金锁区这样的山区，以二十天一次为宜，先一天下午来，晚上汇报、研究工作，第二天专门学习。
    二、讲课教员必须由区委书记、区长和下乡的县委会的部长、县人民政府的科长等担任。因为这些人的讲解能力较强，能够提高干部学习的兴趣。为了保证教学质量，帮助区级领导同志解决备课的困难，县委宣传部须要供给讲授提纲。铜川县这样作了，讲课同志很欢迎。区的负责同志说：只要经常给我们解决提纲问题，我们就有信心把学习站办好。
    三、要及时检查干部的学习情况。金锁区的学习站自从成立以来，曾经检查过两次学习笔记，举行过五次测验，这都有力地督促了干部学习。
    金锁区干部学习站的工作，还存在着一些缺点，例如没有一个周密的计划，致使报告、讨论有时候不能如期进行；许多干部只听课，平时不注意学习；吸收不脱离生产的乡村干部和积极分子参加学习的结果，影响了他们的生产。这些问题，区委会正在逐步予以解决。最近区委会已订出了学习计划，并让各乡工作组长（区干部）担任学习辅导员，解决干部学习中的困难；学习站参加的人也逐渐变为以脱离生产的干部为主。此外，区委会还正在研究如何进一步改进干部的文化学习的问题，使干部的政治觉悟程度、工作能力和文化水平都不断地提高。
