Limeizhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Taigu County Organizes Wheat Deposit Business
The Limeizhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative in the Fourth District of Taigu County, Shanxi Province, has achieved good results by using the method of "deposit in kind" to purchase wheat from farmers.

In the third quarter, the Limeizhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative did not purchase much wheat. At that time, some farmers who had a large amount of wheat stored were planning to store it because they did not have any urgent expenses. They planned to sell the wheat in the winter or next spring to buy livestock, build houses, marry daughters-in-law, or purchase other large items. They were afraid that selling the wheat early would mean "money in hand, food in mouth," wasting the wheat and not being able to buy anything. In addition, a few farmers held the idea of "waiting for high prices" and planned to store the wheat until next year before selling it. In order to solve these ideological problems of the farmers and to complete the task of grain purchase well, the cadres of the Limeizhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative, with the approval of the County Cooperative Union and the County Grain Bureau, began to use the method of storing in kind to purchase wheat from the fourth quarter. They stipulated that when farmers deposit wheat with the cooperative, the cooperative will issue a receipt, and when the money is needed, it will be calculated at the current price, and the price will be allowed to rise but not fall.

As soon as the method of storing grain in kind was proposed, the farmers' ideological problems of "waiting for high prices" and fearing that the money would not be kept after selling the wheat were solved. In three days, ten farmers deposited more than 4,300 jin of wheat in the cooperative.

At that time, some farmers stored wheat because they wanted to buy livestock and other items that the cooperative did not have. According to this situation, the Limeizhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative, on the one hand, mobilized farmers to deposit in kind, and on the other hand, investigated the needs of farmers and supplied the materials needed by the masses as much as possible. For example, they learned that 21 farmers who deposited wheat planned to buy livestock, so they told the County Cooperative Union to help them buy it. Farmer Chang Peiji planned to buy livestock and deposited 1,200 jin of wheat in the cooperative on October 8th. The cooperative bought the livestock for him on October 25th. This practice of supplying materials according to the needs of the masses also promoted the development of the deposit business.

The Limeizhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative paid attention to carrying out political propaganda work while developing the wheat deposit business. They publicized the significance of the state's purchase of grain, the benefits of the deposit method for the state to control grain and avoid losses due to farmers' grain storage, and solved the ideological concerns of some farmers who were "afraid of revealing their family wealth." After the farmers understood the benefits of storing wheat in the cooperative for the country and themselves, they enthusiastically stored wheat in the cooperative. According to the statistics on October 25th, 63 farmers in each village deposited nearly 20,000 jin of wheat in kind. The amount of wheat stored in kind was equal to 158% of the amount of wheat purchased by the cooperative in cash during the same period. (Li Wenshan)

    太谷县里美庄供销合作社举办小麦存实业务
    山西省太谷县第四区里美庄供销合作社，运用“存实”的办法。收购农民的小麦，效果很好。
    里美庄供销合作社第三季度收购的小麦不多，当时有一部分存有大量小麦的农民因为没有紧急花费，都准备把小麦存起来，等今冬、明春买牲畜、盖房子、娶媳妇或购置其他大东西的时候再卖。他们恐怕早卖了小麦是“钱到手，饭到口”，浪费了小麦，买不到东西。另外还有少数农民抱着“等高价”的思想，计划把麦子存到明年再卖。里美庄供销合作社的干部为了解决农民的这些思想问题，很好地完成收购粮食的任务，经过县合作社联合社和县粮食局同意，从第四季度起开始用存实的办法收购小麦。他们规定农民向合作社存小麦，由合作社开给收据，用钱时按当时价格计算，同时价格听涨不听落。
    粮食存实的办法一经提出，农民们原来“等高价”和怕卖出小麦后钱存不住的思想问题解决了。三天中，就有十户农民把四千三百多斤小麦存到合作社里。
    当时有一部分农民把小麦存起来，是想购买合作社没有的牲口等物品。里美庄供销合作社根据这一情况，一面动员农民存实，一面调查农民的需要，尽可能地供应群众需要的物资。如他们了解到存麦农民中有二十一户打算买牲口，便告诉县合作社联合社帮助购买。农民常培基打算买牲口，十月八日把一千二百斤小麦存到合作社里，十月二十五日合作社就给他把牲口买来了。这样根据群众需要供应物资的作法，也推动了存实业务的开展。
    里美庄供销合作社在开展小麦存实业务时，注意进行了政治宣传工作。他们宣传了国家收购粮食的意义，宣传了存实的办法对国家掌握粮食、避免农民存粮损耗等方面的好处，并解决了部分农民“怕露家底”等思想顾虑。农民们了解了把小麦存到合作社对国家、对自己的好处以后，踊跃地把小麦存到合作社里。据十月二十五日的统计，各村有六十三户农民存实小麦近两万斤。存实小麦数量，等于同一时期合作社现款收购小麦数量的百分之一百五十八。  （李文珊）
