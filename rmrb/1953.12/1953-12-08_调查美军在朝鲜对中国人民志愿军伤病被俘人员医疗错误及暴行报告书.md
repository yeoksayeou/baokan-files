On April 11, 1953, the representatives of both sides in the Korean War armistice negotiations signed an agreement in Panmunjom to exchange wounded and sick prisoners of war. The first batch of wounded and sick Chinese People's Volunteers returned to the embrace of their motherland. When they saw the people of their country offering them comfort, they expressed their indignation and recounted the immense suffering they endured during their captivity and the fact that their wounds and illnesses had not been properly treated.

After the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement on July 27, another batch of wounded and sick Chinese People's Volunteers returned in early August. Most of these wounded and sick individuals should have been repatriated in April but were detained by the U.S. side for three to four months in violation of the agreement. Among the "non-wounded and sick" personnel who returned at the same time, 107 were found to have wounds and illnesses and were treated in the hospital along with the wounded and sick. In total, there were 1,609 hospitalized wounded and sick individuals in the two batches. To address the medical issues of the returning wounded and sick personnel, our organization specially invited experienced specialists and experts in various fields to conduct an investigation and research on their health conditions.

The poor nutritional status of the returning personnel was a universal phenomenon. Therefore, in addition to the wounded and sick, we also examined 1,045 non-wounded and sick individuals who returned in early August. The purpose was to thoroughly understand the nutritional and health conditions of the general prisoners of war, so as to propose specific measures to help them recover their health as soon as possible.

Among the 1,609 wounded and sick individuals, 1,172 had surgical diseases, 567 had internal medicine diseases (225 had both internal and surgical diseases, so they were listed in both categories), and 95 had other diseases (including 35 mental illness patients).

Among the 1,172 surgical patients, 840 had varying degrees of disability. At least 135 of these cases were clearly the responsibility of the U.S. side. Improper amputations were the main cause of disability. The U.S. side's handling of many wounds violated medical principles. The current poor outcomes clearly indicate that the U.S. side deliberately engaged in evil acts.

The 567 internal medicine patients were almost all chronic patients. Among them, 31 had digestive system diseases, and 14 had other diseases. The vast majority (92%) had chronic respiratory diseases, of which 230 had tuberculosis and 292 had non-tuberculous diseases. Analyzing their disease conditions, we can clearly see that the living conditions in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps were extremely poor. Their disease conditions are also evidence of the U.S. military's persecution of Chinese People's Volunteers.

The following chapters will discuss these issues in detail.

Chapter 2: Bone and Joint War Injury Medical Issues

Among the 1,172 returning wounded, 637 had bone and joint injuries (710 limbs). A detailed study of their treatment during captivity revealed the unforgivable errors made by U.S. military doctors. These errors can be categorized into five types:

1. Lack of proper initial surgical treatment;
2. Insufficient or no fixation of fractures;
3. Inadequate fracture reduction;
4. Irrational manipulation leading to re-fractures;
5. Irrational amputations.

1. Lack of Proper Initial Surgical Treatment:

Among the 710 open bone and joint injuries, excluding 81 limbs that had been treated before capture or whose initial treatment was unknown due to unconsciousness, only 214 limbs (34%) received surgical treatment within seven days of capture. The remaining 415 limbs (66%) did not receive initial surgical treatment.

Case 1: Medical Record No. 146, Liu Wen Cai (also known as Liu Wen Xi), Detention No. 730247.

On March 3, 1951, the right foot was injured by an explosion, and after 12 hours, he was captured. The wound was bandaged but not fixed. For six days after capture, he received no treatment. In Busan, after three more days, only a plaster cast was applied, but the wound did not receive any surgical treatment. As a result, the infection spread, and the fourth and fifth toes became necrotic and were amputated. The other three toes did not change color. In May 1951, an amputation was performed at the ankle. The infection did not stop, and a second amputation was performed at the lower third of the calf.

This patient was captured 12 hours after the injury, which was the most suitable time for debridement. The U.S. military doctors did not perform early debridement or fixation but instead transported him to the rear hospital. Even after arriving at the hospital, they did not perform timely surgery, delaying for three days before applying a plaster cast, which allowed the infection to spread. They did not provide appropriate treatment for the infection but instead used amputation and re-amputation as the main treatment methods.

2. Insufficient or No Fixation of Fractures:

All limb bone and joint injuries should be fixed during transport, especially in the lower extremities, which is very important. Among the returning wounded, there were 483 cases of lower limb fractures. Of these, 210 cases (43.5%) had no transport fixation.

Even in the rear hospital in Busan, fractures were often not fixed in the later stages, and some fixations were very inadequate. Among the 710 cases of fractured limbs, 175 had insufficient or no fixation.

Case 2: Medical Record No. 450, Lin Tai Xian (formerly known as Lin Tai Xian), Detention No. 706463.

On May 22, 1951, the left ankle and right heel were injured by an explosion, and he bandaged himself. Two and a half days later, he was captured. The left ankle was severely infected and swollen with maggots. After an incision and drainage, no fixation was applied post-surgery. About 20 days later, he was forced to stand and walk, resulting in a re-fracture, but no fixation was provided. About two months later, he was again ordered to walk and move, which worsened the infection. After two more surgeries, he still did not receive any fixation for a year, resulting in severe deformity.

Proper fixation to prevent deformity is a basic requirement in the treatment of bone and joint war injuries. This example shows that U.S. military doctors violated this principle by not providing any fixation.

Case 3: Medical Record No. 1366, Yan Tong Shan (formerly known as Yin Dong Sheng), Detention No. 706353.

On January 11, 1951, he was injured by a gunshot, resulting in a fracture of the lower third of the left calf. After capture, the U.S. side did not perform debridement but applied a plaster cast below the knee after changing the dressing. In Busan, he did not receive treatment for two months, and the wound became infected with maggots, so the plaster cast was removed and the dressing was changed. In the same year, on August 10, a piece of dead bone was removed once, but no fixation was applied afterward. To this day, the bone ends have not connected.

The fracture of the lower third of the calf was not debrided, allowing the infection to spread. Only an inadequate plaster cast below the knee was applied, and it was removed after two months, resulting in the current condition of unconnected bone ends.

Case 4: Medical Record No. 573, Liu Yu Chun, Detention No. 706417.

On May 1951, the right upper arm was injured by a gunshot, resulting in a fracture of the humerus. Three hours later, he was captured. In Daejeon, after surgery, the right forearm was tightly fixed to the chest with a plaster cast. Two months later in Busan, the plaster cast was removed. The right shoulder was contracted and could not be abducted.

The chest-humerus plaster cast fixation is only suitable for temporary transport fixation. However, in the U.S. "hospital" in Busan, this fixation was retained as the standard treatment for humerus fractures, resulting in the patient's shoulder joint being internally contracted and deformed, causing unnecessary disability.

3. Inadequate Fracture Reduction:

Among the 637 bone and joint war injury patients, 583 (91.5%) had varying degrees of disability (in addition, 11 are still under treatment, and the outcome is uncertain). Among the 583, 231 had malunited fractures. From these results, one can suspect that U.S. military doctors did not perform adequate reduction on the fractures of our captured personnel. The following X-ray images of fractures show the general situation of U.S. military doctors' treatment of fractures (Figures 3–15).

Among the 153 cases of femoral fractures, 130 limbs (85%) did not receive traction, and seven cases had internal fixation. Sixteen cases had attempted traction, but these tractions also had many errors.

Case 5: Medical Record No. 51, Gao Yun Cheng, Detention No. 730215.

On October 1, 1952, in the Jeju Island prisoner-of-war camp, he was deliberately shot in the right femur by U.S. soldiers, resulting in a fracture of the lower third of the right femur. He was sent to the "hospital" in Busan for surgery, but the fracture was not reduced and only a hip Y-shaped plaster cast was applied.

Currently, the right leg is 5.5 cm shorter and has a severe angular deformity.

Generally, the treatment of femoral fractures involves traction to maintain fracture reduction. In the April 1951 issue of the "Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery," former U.S. military doctor Colonel Cleveland (M. Cleveland) and others wrote an article stating that in hospitals and field hospitals, traction should be used to treat fractures of the femur, tibia, fibula, and humerus, and each case should be maintained for a sufficient period to achieve satisfactory results. Traction should be maintained until the fracture ends are sufficiently stable and will not displace or become angularly deformed.

This example shows that U.S. military doctors did not follow their own principles in treating the fractures of Chinese People's Volunteers.

Case 6: Medical Record No. 648, Gao Qi Fang, Detention No. 730269.

On May 28, 1951, he was injured by a gunshot, resulting in a fracture of the lower third of the right thigh. After capture, on June 1, a hip Y-shaped plaster cast was applied in Busan, and a pin was inserted in the heel for traction. After half a month, the pin was removed and traction was stopped. After another 70 days, the plaster cast was removed. Currently, the femoral fracture has healed, but the right leg is still 5 cm shorter, and the knee joint movement is still restricted.

This example shows that such "traction" is obviously unreasonable and cannot achieve fracture reduction.

Case 7: Medical Record No. 519, Zhang Ying.

On October 3, 1952, the right femur was injured by a gunshot, resulting in a fracture. After capture, debridement was performed, and a hip Y-shaped plaster cast was applied before being transferred to Busan. In early November, the wound was sutured. However, 10 days after suturing, when the wound was almost healed, an incision and reduction were performed, and the fracture was fixed with two steel plates. As a result, the infection recurred postoperatively. To this day, the femur still has extensive osteomyelitis, and the bone ends have not healed (Figure 17).

This example shows that when there is a possibility of infection recurrence, an incision and reduction are performed in violation of field surgery principles, resulting in very poor outcomes.

4. Irrational Manipulation Leading to Re-fractures:

Case 8: Medical Record No. 1277, Geng Zhao Ting (formerly known as Kang Cheng Ding), Detention No. 706268.

On February 1951, the right arm was injured by a gunshot, resulting in a fracture of the humerus. On the same day, he was captured. In the front line, debridement was performed, and a plaster cast was applied. In Busan, the plaster cast was changed after three days. Three months later, when the plaster cast was removed, the fracture had healed, but the elbow joint was stiff. Five days later, four people forcibly performed manipulation. At that time, the fracture was re-broken, and the patient heard the sound. Afterward, it became swollen, and it took more than 10 days to subside. After another X-ray, a plaster cast was reapplied.

This example shows that U.S. military doctors did not follow the principle of not forcibly moving a stiff joint. After the elbow plaster cast was removed, there was movement impairment, but instead of allowing the patient to gradually recover through self-exercise, they violated the principle and forcibly manipulated the joint, resulting in a re-fracture. Similar situations were found in five other bone and joint injury patients, with two cases of re-fracture of the humerus and four cases of re-fracture of the femur.

5. Irrational Amputations:

Case 9: Medical Record No. 152, Nie Ming Yin (formerly known as Nie Ting), Detention No. 780077.

On April 29, 1951, he was injured by an explosion and captured. The middle of the right lower leg was fractured, and the third, fourth, and fifth toes of the right foot were blown off. Five hours after the injury, surgery was performed. At that time, the right foot had not turned black, and the ankle and remaining toes could still move. After waking up from anesthesia, he found that his right thigh had been amputated above the knee.

This example shows that in the early stages of war injuries, there was no gas gangrene, and there were no symptoms of major blood vessel damage. However, an early high-level amputation was performed instead of initial treatment. There are many similar cases. Among the 637 bone and joint war injuries, 128 were amputated due to bone and joint injuries, which is a criminal act. The amputation issue is a prominent problem and will be further analyzed in Chapter 4.

Summary:

1. Among the 637 bone and joint war injury patients, 66.0% did not receive initial debridement.
2. Among the 483 open fractures of the lower limbs, 43.5% had no transport fixation.
3. Among the 153 open femoral fractures, 85% did not receive traction.
4. Among the 637 bone and joint war injury patients, 509 cases can still be examined for fracture healing (excluding 128 cases that have been amputated and cannot be examined), of which 231 cases had malunited fractures (45.4%).
5. Six cases of re-fracture due to forcible manipulation.
6. Among the 637 bone and joint war injury patients, 128 were amputated, accounting for 20% (excluding traumatic amputations).

Chapter 3: Frostbite Treatment and Post-Capture Frostbite Issues

Among the 1,172 returning surgical patients, 139 had been treated for frostbite in the U.S. prisoner-of-war "hospital" in Busan. Most of these individuals had lost limbs and became disabled. We conducted an in-depth study of these cases to further understand the medical treatment of our captured personnel in the prisoner-of-war camps.

Among the 139 frostbite patients, six had both firearm injuries and frostbite on the same limb, with the firearm injury being the primary condition, so they were not included in the study of frostbite medical issues. The total number of subjects in this chapter's study is 133, with 276 frostbitten limbs (including 14 limbs with minor firearm injuries, but the main condition of these limbs was still frostbite) (see Table 1).

Table 1: Number of Frostbite Patients and Limbs (Total number of returning wounded is 1,172)

Note: *Includes 14 limbs with firearm injuries.

1. Treatment and Outcomes of Frostbite

The treatment of frostbite by U.S. military doctors for our captured personnel was mostly without active and reasonable measures to promote local blood circulation. Instead, they hastily performed amputations without waiting for the demarcation of necrosis, and the amputation sites were often far above the necessary level. Two examples are provided below:

Case 10: Medical Record No. 656, Zhao Jing Long (formerly known as Dan Zhen Li), Detention No. 702970.

On February 1951, the shoulder was injured by a penetrating gunshot, and after the injury, he retreated from the front line on his own. Along the way, he fainted and woke up unable to continue walking. Three days later, both feet turned red from frostbite, and seven days later, he was captured. Two weeks later, both lower legs were amputated simultaneously at the lower third. Before the amputation, the right foot was red, the footback was slightly swollen but not red, and there was no breakage; the left foot's five toes were black and dry. After the amputation, the wound was immediately sutured, and the sutures were removed after 10 days. The wound healed after one week.

Case 11: Medical Record No. 138, Li Qin, Detention No. 706317.

On January 1951, the chest, forehead, and right heel were injured by an explosion and could not move immediately. Two days later, he was captured and transported to Busan. The left foot's toes turned black, and the sole had blisters and ulcers. Within 48 hours in Busan, the U.S. military doctors performed an amputation of the left lower leg at the middle third. The wound was sutured and healed after one week.

In the above two cases, the frostbite in Case 10 was not severely infected, and the right foot had no necrosis. Only the left foot's toes were necrotic. Only the necrotic toes of the left foot should have been amputated. However, the U.S. military doctors decided to perform high-level amputations, sacrificing both feet. Case 11 shows that the U.S. military doctors performed early high-level amputations without waiting for the demarcation of frostbite necrosis. There are many similar cases of high-level amputations with primary sutures. Although this was done, it could not guarantee primary healing of the amputation site. In fact, it often resulted in wound re-infection, bone exposure, and the need for re-amputation, making the amputation site higher. The following statistics make this clearer.

The treatment outcomes for the 133 returning frostbite patients were: 119 amputations or necrotic tissue removals, accounting for 89.5%; 14 had no disabilities, accounting for 10.5% (see Table 2).

Table 2: Treatment Outcomes for 133 Returning Frostbite Patients

Note: *The number of people in this table is calculated based on the main disability condition. If a person has two frostbitten limbs, one amputated and the other with necrotic tissue removed, this person is counted as an amputation.

According to the principle of treating frostbite necrosis, the approach should be "highly conservative," and only the necrotic part should be removed after the demarcation of necrosis. Any amputation beyond the natural demarcation of necrosis is against the principle. Under the treatment of U.S. military doctors, 70% of the 133 frostbite cases were amputated above the necrotic tissue, violating the "highly conservative" principle. In November 1951, Colonel Bower of the U.S. Army Medical Corps published an article in the "Journal of Surgery and Obstetrics" (Volume 93, page 529) titled "A Study of Six Months of Korean War Injuries," which emphasized the "highly conservative" principle. The article reported that among 630 frostbite cases, only 87 (13.8%) required amputation. Compared to the situation where 70% of our captured personnel were amputated, it is clear that the U.S. side discriminated against prisoners of war, violating medical principles and humanitarianism.

Further analyzing the amputation sites of frostbite, we can see the serious situation of violating the "highly conservative" principle in treating frostbite.

To facilitate analysis and avoid the possibility of other factors affecting the amputation sites, we excluded those with firearm injuries and only analyzed the 139 pure frostbite lower limbs (see Tables 3 and 4, Figure 20).

Table 3: Frostbite Treatment Outcomes

Note: *This table shows that 139 limbs of pure frostbite lower limb amputations account for the vast majority of the total number of frostbitten limbs.

To clearly indicate the frostbite amputation sites, the lower limbs are divided into nine sections as shown in Figure 19.

Table 4: Frostbite Sites and Amputation Sites (139 lower limbs)

Figure 20: Frostbite Over-Amputation (Lower Limbs—139 Limbs)

From Table 4 and Figure 20, it can be seen that among the 139 lower limb frostbite amputations, 118 limbs (84.9%) were amputated more than one section above the necessary site. Among these, 28 limbs (20.2%) were amputated more than two sections above the necessary site, and 24 limbs (17.3%) were amputated more than four sections above the necessary site. There were even cases amputated more than five sections.

Generally, when frostbite is limited to the toes, under the principle of preserving the limb as much as possible, only the toes or even the sole can be amputated, and the patient can still walk without a prosthesis. If the amputation is as high as the lower leg, a prosthesis is necessary for walking.

However, from Table 4 and Figure 21, it can be seen that among the 81 cases of toe frostbite, 39 limbs (48.2%) were amputated at the lower leg.

From the above examples and analysis, it is clear that the U.S. side deliberately increased the degree of disability of our captured personnel when treating frostbite.

2. Frostbite Occurring After Capture

Among the 133 frostbite patients, 10 were frostbitten in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camp or "hospital." Under cold conditions, if the patient was captured and transported, sometimes the frostbite obtained on the battlefield could be aggravated or new frostbite could occur due to difficult conditions. The responsibility for this situation is not discussed here. However, if the patient had no frostbite at the time of capture but developed frostbite in the prisoner-of-war camp or in the hospital with medical care, the detaining authorities should be held responsible. Two examples are provided below.

Case 12: Medical Record No. 237, Cai Yin Pu, Detention No. 703288.

On February 1951, the left foot was blown off by a shell, and the left shoulder was injured by an explosion. After capture, he was transported to Busan, and three days later, the U.S. military doctors performed an amputation of the left lower leg at the lower third. The right foot was normal. Because the patient's bed was next to the edge of the tent, and the tent was not fastened, the wind blew in, exposing the patient and the bed. After the surgery, the patient could not move, and the right foot was frostbitten. About 30 days later, the U.S. military doctors performed an amputation of the right lower leg at the lower third. At the time of amputation, only the toes were black, and the footback was slightly swollen.

Case 13: Medical Record No. 773, Fang Pei De, Detention No. 734581.

In June 1951, he was captured. In the winter of the same year, on the island of Geoje, in the 86th Regiment, he was forced to do labor in single clothes. Because he had no shoes and walked barefoot in the snow, his right big toe was frostbitten and rotted.

In the above two cases, Case 12 shows that the U.S. prisoner-of-war hospital did not provide any care for severely injured prisoners of war, resulting in the patient developing frostbite in the hospital bed, and performing high-level amputations without any principles. Case 13 shows that captured personnel had no winter shoes or socks. They were forced to do labor in the snow, resulting in severe frostbite. The inhumane treatment of prisoners of war by the U.S. military is evident.

Summary:

1. Among the 133 returning frostbite patients, 70% were amputated above the necrotic tissue, indicating that U.S. military doctors violated the surgical principle of "highly conservative" treatment for frostbite of our captured personnel.
2. Among the 81 limbs with only toe frostbite, 39 were amputated at the lower leg, further indicating that the U.S. side deliberately increased the degree of disability of our captured personnel.
3. The amputation rate for frostbite treatment by the U.S. military in the Korean War was 13.8%, while the amputation rate for frostbite treatment of our captured personnel by the U.S. side was 70%. The comparison shows that the U.S. side's medical treatment of Chinese People's Volunteers was extremely inhumane.
4. After capture, patients developed severe frostbite in the prisoner-of-war camp or "hospital," further proving the inhuman treatment of our captured personnel.

Chapter 4: Amputation Issues

From the U.S. military doctors' handling of war injuries and frostbite, we found a very prominent phenomenon: they abandoned all recognized principles of war injury treatment and frequently used amputation as the main treatment method for limb injuries. It must be pointed out that this phenomenon is universal, not individual. From a medical perspective, using amputation as the main method of treating war injuries is primitive and unscientific. From a humanitarian perspective, arbitrary amputations are brutal and disregard human dignity. Many unnecessary painful outcomes and limbs that should not have been sacrificed can be blamed on U.S. military doctors. They sought convenience or ease of treatment and amputated limbs that could have been preserved. As for the true reasons, only they know. We believe that their actions are inhumane and unethical. The misuse of amputation surgery is worth further analysis and study.

Among the 1,172 returning wounded, 261 had undergone surgical amputations, losing a total of 360 limbs. In other words, many people lost more than one limb. This number is shocking. After carefully analyzing and studying their medical records, at least 98 patients (114 limbs) became disabled due to the responsibility of the U.S. military doctors. (Some past injury histories are not detailed enough, and the responsibility issue cannot be studied temporarily.) The errors in the entire amputation process are categorized into the following three items:

1. Avoidable amputations;
2. High-level amputations;
3. Unjustified (criminal) amputations.

1. Avoidable Amputations

Among the 114 erroneous amputations, at least 91 were completely avoidable. These include cases where the original injury had no major blood vessel damage or gas gangrene, but no treatment was attempted to preserve the limb, and amputation was performed as the initial surgical treatment.

Case 14: Medical Record No. 489, Wang Yong Qi, Detention No. 730300.

On May 26, 1951, at 1 AM, the lower third of the right calf was injured by a gunshot, resulting in a fracture. The entry wound was 2 cm in diameter, and the exit wound was 4 cm in diameter. At 6 AM, he was captured. In the afternoon of the same day, 18 hours after the injury, he underwent an amputation of the right thigh at the lower third in a U.S. frontline hospital. Before the surgery, in the operating room, while preparing for the surgery, the patient saw that the wound was normal, with no signs of infection, normal skin color and sensation in the foot, and no fever.

This case involved a fracture of the lower third of the right calf, and an amputation above the knee was performed 18 hours after the injury. This approach is clearly a violation of recognized war injury treatment principles. Based on the patient's injury condition and the time after the injury, the reasonable initial treatment should have been early debridement followed by plaster cast fixation. However, the U.S. military doctors performed a high-level amputation without proper indications.

Case 15: Medical Record No. 104, Niu Fu You, Detention No. 712550.

In May 1951, the middle third of the right thigh was injured by a penetrating gunshot, resulting in a fracture of the femur. The entry wound was about 2 cm in diameter, and the exit wound was about 4 cm in diameter. Seven days later, he was captured and underwent the first surgery in Busan, where a Y-shaped plaster cast was applied. Afterward, the wound became infected with maggots, which was very serious. The patient repeatedly requested an examination and showed the maggots to the U.S. military doctors, but they ignored it. Four months later, when the plaster cast was removed, the skin of the leg was ulcerated. The heels and soles also had many ulcers. However, the toes that were not covered by the plaster cast still had normal skin color, and the toes could move well. After 20 days of dressing changes, the U.S. military doctors amputated the right thigh at the upper third. Another month later, a second amputation was performed. Now, the remaining femur end has only a part of the greater trochanter.

The patient stayed in the Busan prisoner-of-war "hospital," and maggots were allowed to breed under the plaster cast for four months, proving that the U.S. military doctors completely ignored the treatment of infected wounds. This amputation seems to have been for superficial infections, which could have been controlled with conservative treatment and did not require amputation.

Let's look at the amputation indications mentioned by U.S. military doctors. In the April 1951 issue of the "Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery" (Volume 33, Issue 2), former U.S. Army Colonel Cleveland (Cleveland) and Manning (Manning) Stewart (Stuart) wrote an article titled "Treatment of Bone and Joint War Injuries," which includes the following:

"1. Division-level treatment methods...
5. Amputation—Frontline medical facilities should not perform amputations unless the limb is almost completely disconnected...

2. Corps-level treatment methods...
5. Amputation
1. Amputation indications
A. Complete disruption of blood circulation, i.e., major blood vessel damage with simultaneous damage to collateral circulation.
B. Diffuse gas gangrene..."

Obviously, U.S. military doctors violated these principles when treating our wounded and captured personnel.

2. High-Level Amputations

When treating the war injuries and frostbite of our captured personnel, U.S. military doctors not only performed too many amputations but also amputated at too high a level, sacrificing many useful joints and bone lengths. To illustrate this fact, the upper and lower limbs can be divided into nine sections as shown in Figures 24 and 25. The number of sections sacrificed above the wound site during amputation can be categorized and illustrated to show the situation of high-level amputations by U.S. military doctors on our captured wounded (Figures 26 and 27). For this, we analyzed the situations of 59 upper limb amputations and 297 lower limb amputations. (Amputations where the position was below the original wound are not listed.)

As shown in Figure 27, among the 297 lower limb amputations, only 65 were performed at the original wound site. Most amputations were high-level. More than half of the cases had amputation sites more than two sections higher than the wound site, and 34 cases had amputations more than four sections higher. There were even cases amputated more than seven sections higher. Figure 26 shows the situation of upper limb amputations, where more than one section higher than the necessary amputation site accounted for 58%. However, the situation is even worse because losing a whole hand due to finger injuries is a very serious problem that does not need to be elaborated.

Figure 26: Upper Limb Amputation Exceeding the Original Wound Site

Figure 27: Lower Limb Amputation Exceeding the Original Wound Site

Using high-level amputations to treat war injuries and frostbite is a violation of recognized medical principles. However, after high-level amputation surgery, due to poor treatment of the residual limb, re-amputation was required, resulting in the loss of residual limb length. Among the 218 cases of open amputation surgery, only 65 had skin traction, including unreasonable traction. Three examples are provided below to illustrate the situation of high-level amputations.

Case 16: Medical Record No. 261, Wang Chang Hai, Detention No. 780298.

On May 24, 1951, he was injured by a machine gun in the right foot and captured. For more than 10 days after capture, he received no treatment and was not cared for. The first treatment was an amputation of the right thigh at the upper third. At the time of amputation, the front half of the right foot was swollen and black, but two toes could still move. The patient could still use his hands to support himself on the bed and slowly move by stepping with the heel. The preoperative skin preparation range was limited to the calf, but the amputation was performed on the upper thigh. After the amputation, the residual limb was left open without traction, resulting in the bone end protruding. Two months later, part of the bone end was amputated again. Now, the length of the right thigh residual limb from the greater trochanter is only 3 cm (Figure 28).

The patient was not treated for more than 10 days after capture, which was very inappropriate. The front half of the foot was injured, but there were no signs of infection in the ankle and calf. In the situation where the patient could still step with the heel, the U.S. military doctors amputated the injured limb at the upper thigh. Worse still, no traction was applied after the amputation, resulting in the need for re-amputation, causing the patient more pain and losing bone length. We cannot help but question the purpose of such "treatment" by U.S. military doctors.

Case 17: Medical Record No. 675, Hu Xiang Yin, Detention No. 700327.

In December 1950, all four limbs were frostbitten and captured. Twenty days later in Busan, the first surgery was performed, amputating both lower legs at the middle third and the right hand at the wrist. After the surgery, the wound was sutured and initially healed after one week. Before the surgery, the condition was that only 10 toes were necrotic, and the footback was slightly red and swollen but not rotting, with no blisters, and the heel could still bear weight. The right hand's thumb and little finger were necrotic. The index, middle, and ring fingers were black only to the middle of the proximal phalanx, and the necrotic part was dry.

The left hand had similar frostbite and infection, and the patient firmly refused amputation, so only the necrotic tissue was removed (Figure 29).

In this case, the frostbite was limited to the fingers and toes, and the necrotic part was dry. It is clear that the reasonable treatment should have been limited to the removal of the necrotic part. However, the U.S. military doctors amputated three limbs out of four, violating their own advocated "highly conservative" principle.

Case 18: Medical Record No. 55, Yang Tong Li (formerly known as Huang Sheng Liang), Detention No. 730759.

In May 1951, the right calf and ankle were injured by shrapnel, with no bone injury, and could still walk. Four or five days later, the right toes were injured by an aerial bomb, and the bone was shattered. Ten days after the injury, he was captured and transported to Busan. Upon arrival in Busan, an amputation was performed at the middle third of the thigh (Figure 30).

The right foot of this patient should have been preserved, especially the right knee joint, which should not have been amputated.

Above, we exposed that U.S. military doctors generally performed amputations at a higher level than necessary. At least 21 limbs were severely affected by the high amputation level, increasing the degree of disability. Among the 91 avoidable amputations mentioned earlier, 74 were high-level amputations. However, since amputation should not have been performed in the first place, there is no need to criticize the level of amputation. Let's see how U.S. military doctors themselves discuss the issue of amputation levels:

(Excerpted from the aforementioned article by Colonel Cleveland)

"Corps-level treatment methods
(5) Amputation...
2. The level of amputation—The level of amputation should be as low as possible according to the nature and condition of the wound.
3. The method of amputation—Based on experience, the open circular method is our chosen method for treating war injuries.
4. The operation of open circular amputation...
K. After amputation, skin traction should be performed immediately and continued until healing during transport."

3. Unjustified (Criminal) Amputations

This category includes amputations without any reason, where it is difficult to find a medical reason for the amputation.

Case 19: Medical Record No. 52, Zhang Hua Sheng, Detention No. 730242.

On May 25, 1951, the lower third of the right thigh and the right calf had penetrating soft tissue injuries, with no fractures. After the injury, he bandaged himself and could still walk for three days, crossing a mountain range of about 100 miles. Three days after the injury, he was captured and sent to a U.S. frontline hospital. During the transfer, he did not need assistance when getting on and off the vehicle. After arriving at the hospital, he was injected with a shot and given a pill, immediately losing consciousness. Upon waking up, he found that his right thigh had been amputated above the knee (Figure 31).

This patient definitely had no fractures, no major blood vessel or nerve injuries, and no severe infections; otherwise, he would not have been able to walk 100 miles across a mountain range. Therefore, this amputation is completely unreasonable and criminal.

Case 20: Medical Record No. 182, Liang Qing Hui, Detention No. 719717.

On September 25, 1952, at 5 AM, the index and middle fingers were injured by a light machine gun near the proximal interphalangeal joint. The injured fingers were almost detached. At 2 PM, he was captured and sent to a U.S. hospital at 8 PM. The next afternoon at 2 PM, 33 hours after the injury, he was sent to the operating room for a forearm amputation without any preoperative preparation. The condition at the time of surgery: the hand was normal in color with only slight swelling. The thumb, ring finger, and little finger were uninjured.

This patient had injuries only to the index and middle fingers, with the other fingers uninjured. Early surgery should have been limited to the removal of the necrotic part. However, the U.S. military doctors ignored the uninjured fingers and amputated the hand at the wrist. For an important working hand, this is not only a high-level amputation but a criminal mutilation.

Summary:

(1) U.S. military doctors used amputation as the main treatment method for war injuries and frostbite.
(2) Due to the criminal actions of U.S. military doctors, at least 114 limbs should not have been amputated. The U.S. side should be held responsible.
(3) Most amputations were performed at high levels, sacrificing joints and bone lengths that could have been preserved.
(4) Amputations were even performed without any medical basis.

Chapter 5: Other War Injury Medical Issues

The disregard for the pain of wounded personnel and the mistreatment by U.S. military doctors were not limited to the previously discussed issues of bone and joint injuries, frostbite, and amputations. Similar situations also occurred in the treatment of other war injuries. The following examples illustrate:

Case 21: Medical Record No. 1499, Sun Bo, Detention No. 731554.

In mid-October 1951, the left chest was injured by a gunshot, and the next morning, he was captured. In Busan, the first surgery was performed. After the surgery, he continued to have a fever, cough up blood, and the wound leaked air. Two months later, a second surgery was performed with rubber tube drainage. In the following three months, the symptoms did not improve, and a third surgery was performed—rib resection, and chest cavity drainage was maintained. Three weeks after the surgery, coughing up blood stopped, but the wound continued to leak air. In June, during dressing changes, eight months after hospitalization, two bullet fragments were removed from the wound. Two months later, the wound finally healed. After returning to the country, an examination showed that the left chest wall was sunken in the middle. The chest wall flapped during breathing. The patient often had more than 30 breaths per minute, and the breathing rate increased with slight exertion, showing symptoms of respiratory distress. X-ray images showed that the sixth and seventh ribs were completely missing, and the fifth rib was partially missing. The pleura was only slightly thickened (Figures 33A, B, C).

The errors made by U.S. military doctors in this treatment are as follows:

1. The first and second surgeries were inappropriate. If the U.S. military doctors had removed the foreign objects and achieved sufficient drainage during these two surgeries, the patient's chronic empyema could have been avoided.
2. Rib resection was performed before the pleura was sufficiently thickened, violating chest surgery principles and resulting in the current respiratory distress.
3. After the surgery, although severe respiratory obstruction was caused, the U.S. military doctors did not provide any appropriate treatment to reduce the patient's pain for more than a year, not even using a simple pressure pad.

Case 22: Medical Record No. 518, Wang Quan, Detention No. 706386.

In February 1951, the right lower limb was injured by an explosion (soft tissue injury in the upper third of the thigh, open fracture of the tibia and fibula in the upper third of the calf), and both feet had frostbite. Five days after the injury, he was captured and sent to the Busan prisoner-of-war hospital. The right calf underwent 15 surgeries, with 11 of these surgeries performed within two to three weeks. During the 14th surgery, the peroneal nerve was cut, resulting in right foot drop. The thigh injury was not treated.

After returning to the country, an examination showed that the right toes and metatarsal heads were missing due to frostbite and the removal of necrotic tissue. The foot was in a clubfoot-like deformity. Dorsiflexion and eversion movements were completely lost. The inner side of the upper third of the thigh had a fistula. X-ray images showed a large bullet fragment remaining in the thigh, approximately 8 cm below the lesser trochanter, near the fistula (Figures 34A, B, C).

The main disability of this patient was directly caused by the surgical cutting of the peroneal nerve. Performing surgery every two to three weeks, totaling 11 times, shows that the surgeries were inappropriate and the technique was poor. On the other hand, the large bullet fragment remaining in the thigh was ignored by the U.S. military doctors for more than two years, resulting in a persistent fistula.

Case 23: Medical Record No. 1314, Wang Xian Ting (formerly known as Wang Sheng Xiong), Detention No. 707633.

On May 27, 1951, he was captured and had no injuries at the time. On October 1, 1952, during the celebration of the National Day of the People's Republic of China in the prisoner-of-war camp, he was shot by U.S. soldiers—multiple soft tissue injuries. One and a half days after the injury, debridement was performed. Four days later, secondary suturing was performed. Part of the wound healed after seven days of suture removal, while part of the wound became infected. The right calf injury was deeper and more extensive, taking more than three months to heal. During the treatment, the right calf was never fixed, and there was no help with functional exercises.

Currently, the right foot is in a fixed clubfoot-like deformity, caused by severe Achilles tendon contracture. The peroneus longus, peroneus brevis, and tibialis anterior muscles are highly stretched, but there are no signs of paralysis (Figure 35).

The foot drop deformity of this patient was caused by Achilles tendon contracture. If the U.S. military doctors had applied some simple steps during treatment, such as appropriate fixation, this deformity and disability could have been completely avoided.

Case 24: Medical Record No. 1413, Kang Ming Quan, Detention No. 780387.

On October 2, 1951, the left eye was injured by a fragment of a shell. At the time, he bandaged it with a first aid kit. Two hours later, he was captured. That night, he was interrogated about military information until late at night and was beaten. The next day, he was sent to the U.S. division headquarters for interrogation about military information and then escorted southward, arriving in Seoul after four days. During these several days, he did not receive any food or treatment for his injured eye. In Seoul, he stayed for more than half a month, and the bandage was changed only twice. Then, he was transferred to Busan for the first examination. During the examination, it was found that his vision had deteriorated and he could no longer distinguish objects. Two months later, the inflammation subsided, and he could distinguish the number of fingers at a distance of one meter. In June 1952, he was transferred to Jeju Island. On the island, he was subjected to four instances of gas poisoning. One month later, the left eye was completely blind. Afterward, he often had symptoms of irritation.

After returning to the country, an examination showed that the right eye was normal, the left eye was shrunken, and there was adhesions and corneal leukoplakia with conjunctival congestion (Figure 36).

In this case, after being injured and captured, he was repeatedly interrogated about military information and beaten. Although there were treatment conditions in the regiment and division headquarters, he did not receive even the simplest treatment, resulting in the delay in treatment of the eye injury, ultimately leading to blindness. Even worse, after the eye was completely blind and repeatedly showed symptoms of irritation, the U.S. military doctors did not follow ophthalmology treatment principles to remove the eye early to prevent sympathetic ophthalmia and ensure the safety of the healthy eye.

Case 25: Medical Record No. 1442, Hu Tian Sheng, Detention No. 71422.

On October 7, 1951, in the afternoon, he was injured by a shell explosion. He was unconscious for several hours. After regaining consciousness, he found that he had been captured and felt severe pain in the right eye, losing vision. That day, he was taken to the regiment and division headquarters for interrogation about military information. On October 12, he was transferred to Busan. During these several days, the injured eye was very painful but did not receive any treatment. In Busan, the bandage was changed twice a week, and penicillin was injected. One month later, the inflammation in the eye subsided, but the upper eyelid and eye socket formed adhesions. The conjunctiva in the eyelid margin was exposed, causing tearing and pain when encountering wind and dust.

After returning to the country, an examination showed that the right eye socket was sunken, and the inner surface of the upper eyelid was completely adhered to the highly shrunken eye. The conjunctiva in the eyelid margin was exposed and severely congested (Figure 37).

In this case, the injury was severe at the time of capture and should have been treated as an emergency. However, the U.S. military doctors repeatedly interrogated about military information, delaying the treatment of the injured eye, resulting in the patient being in extreme pain for several days after the injury. In Busan, effective prevention of eyelid and eye socket adhesions was not performed, resulting in a hideous deformity. The conjunctiva was exposed year-round, often causing tearing and pain, becoming a lifelong mental and physical pain for the patient.

Summary:

In the previous chapters, we exposed the unreasonable treatment by U.S. military doctors in the issues of bone and joint injuries, frostbite, and amputations, violating medical principles. This chapter provides more facts to show that U.S. military doctors made similar errors in the treatment of other war injuries.

The medical records presented in this chapter show that U.S. military doctors could allow eye injuries to develop into eyelid and eye socket adhesions without prevention; they did not remove the eye that had lost function and showed symptoms of irritation in a timely manner to prevent the risk of sympathetic ophthalmia in the healthy eye; they brutally cut important nerves during surgery, causing deformities and paralysis; they performed chest wall shaping surgery without considering the indications, resulting in respiratory distress, and did not provide any treatment for a year after the adverse effects occurred; they did not even perform the simplest steps, such as splint fixation, to prevent Achilles tendon contracture deformities.

In summary, U.S. military doctors not only did little to relieve the pain of our captured personnel but also created many disabilities.

Chapter 6: Nutritional Situation

The malnutrition of the returning personnel was universal. Because the diseases of the wounded and sick might affect their nutritional status, we examined 1,045 non-wounded and sick individuals who returned in early August as our subjects for nutritional investigation. This group of people was part of those repatriated after the signing of the armistice agreement and was completely unselected. The investigation results showed the following universal malnutrition phenomena:

1. General emaciation and light weight;
2. Anemia;
3. Vitamin A deficiency;
4. Riboflavin deficiency;
5. Increased capillary fragility.

The following is a detailed description of these phenomena:

1. General Condition

The general condition of this group of returning personnel was unhealthy. They were obviously weak, with dull complexions, dry skin, and lack of spirit, appearing older than their actual age. Almost everyone felt weak all over the body and easily fatigued; even slight activities, such as running or climbing stairs, would cause shortness of breath. After returning, they still felt insufficient after sleeping for eight or nine hours at night; their appetite had improved, but their food intake was far from the standard before capture. Many people's food intake was only half of what it was before capture.

2. Weight

The weight of this group of people was measured once when they first returned and again after 26 days. During this short period, except for a few people who had weight loss due to malnutrition edema disappearing after eating well, the vast majority (more than 80%) had significant weight gain. The situation is as follows:

Table 5: Weight Increase Table

*Note: Among these 199 people, 76 had no weight increase, and 123 had weight loss due to the disappearance of malnutrition edema.

<h3>File continued from previous part</h3>

Title: Report on the Health Conditions of Returning POWs
Author:
Date: 1953-10
Page: 1

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 1953

A total of 1045 people were examined, excluding 5 who did not have a reference weight. The weight gain recorded in the table represents only part of the weight lost by the returning personnel during their captivity. This is because: first, the recovery period was not long enough, and most people's weight was still increasing; second, malnutrition is often accompanied by increased tissue fluid, even significant edema, so during the recovery period, the weight might temporarily decrease due to fluid loss. Despite this, 841 out of the returning personnel gained weight in 26 days, with an average increase of 2.8 kilograms, and 125 people gained more than 5 kilograms. This is strong evidence that our captured personnel lost a significant amount of weight during their detention.

Three, Hemoglobin
In this group of non-injured and non-ill individuals, the hemoglobin levels of 785 people were measured without selection. From Table 6, it can be seen that the majority of the returning personnel have hemoglobin concentrations below normal. Over 80% of people have hemoglobin levels below 12 grams per 100 cc of blood, over 60% below 11 grams, and over 40% below 10 grams; the average hemoglobin level is only 10.3 grams. These non-injured and non-ill individuals were considered "healthy" by the Americans and were repatriated after the signing of the armistice agreement. They had not recently lost blood, had not undergone any surgery, and had no diseases that could cause anemia. Such widespread anemia cannot be explained by any individual cause. There must be a common factor among these returning personnel, and this common factor must be the long-term malnutrition that most easily causes anemia.

Table 6: Hemoglobin Statistics Table

Four, Vitamin Deficiency
Their vitamin deficiencies are mainly due to a lack of vitamin A and riboflavin. We diagnosed vitamin A deficiency based on symptoms such as night blindness, skin follicle keratinization, Bitot's spots, and dry eye syndrome. We diagnosed riboflavin deficiency based on symptoms such as angular stomatitis, oral ulcers, tongue changes, and scrotal eczema. In reality, multiple symptoms often coexist, and cases diagnosed based on a single symptom are extremely rare.

We also conducted capillary fragility tests. (The capillary fragility test was performed using Wintrobe's method, where 21 or more petechiae within a 5 cm diameter circle are considered positive.)

The results of the above tests are statistically summarized in the following table:

Table 7: Vitamin Deficiency Statistics Table

Note:
1. Total number of examinations: 1045 people.
2. The capillary fragility test was positive in 72 out of 407 people.
3. There were 809 people with both vitamin A and riboflavin deficiencies, 214 people with either vitamin A or riboflavin deficiency, totaling 1023 people, which is 97.9% of the total number of examinations.

Based on the examination results as shown in Table 7, the nutritional deficiencies among the returning non-injured and non-ill personnel are very severe. More than half have night blindness, and 63.1% have skin follicle keratinization. The total number of people with vitamin A deficiency reaches 90%. Similarly, riboflavin deficiency is also widespread, with a total of 79.7%; if all symptoms during captivity are included, this can reach 88%. 18% of people show increased capillary fragility, so latent vitamin C deficiency also exists.

Usually, the appearance of vitamin deficiency symptoms is related to total calorie intake. The same degree of vitamin deficiency may be more pronounced in conditions of adequate calorie intake, but in long-term starvation, it may be hidden. The calorie intake of our captured personnel during captivity was long-term inadequate (details later). Therefore, the frequency of various vitamin deficiency symptoms found above can only represent part of the universality and severity of malnutrition in American POW camps.

In summary, the nutritional conditions of the returning personnel are very poor. We know that malnutrition and malnutrition are important factors in inducing various acute and chronic diseases. For example, protein deficiency and vitamin C deficiency can affect wound healing; vitamin A deficiency can cause changes in respiratory tract epithelial cells, making it easier to contract respiratory infections. Therefore, from the perspective of nutritional conditions, it can also explain why so many returning personnel suffer from serious diseases.

Five, Causes of Malnutrition
The above materials undoubtedly prove that the nutritional conditions of the returning personnel are universally poor, and the incidence of various malnutrition diseases is alarmingly high.

Malnutrition diseases usually have the following causes:
1. Various internal and external factors affect the digestion and absorption of food;
2. Various internal and external factors increase the body's need for nutrients;
3. The quality and quantity of nutrients in food are insufficient;
4. A combination of the above factors.

A brief understanding of the living conditions of the returning personnel in American POW camps makes it easy to understand why their nutritional conditions are so poor. First, the American military frequently uses various massacres, torture, and other inhuman acts, creating terror and threats, increasing the metabolic rate of the captured personnel, and seriously affecting the digestion and absorption of food. As for starvation and thirst, they directly harm nutritional conditions. Second, the captured personnel are often forced to do labor in the POW camps, working long hours each day, consuming a large amount of physical strength, naturally increasing the body's need for nutrients. Third, directly affecting nutritional conditions is the quality and quantity of food. Based on the materials we have, the quality of food in American POW camps is very poor, and the quantity is insufficient.

Each returning personnel unanimously reported that they never had a full meal in American POW camps. Among the returning personnel, some had worked as cooks in various American POW camps. Based on the reports of these familiar individuals, we estimated the average daily food intake per person. Such estimates, although possibly higher than the actual food intake of the captured personnel, are already sufficient to indicate that the captured personnel were living in a long-term semi-starvation state. The total daily calorie intake is insufficient, and fats and animal proteins are also severely lacking. All vitamins are insufficient, especially vitamin A (estimated to be only one-tenth of the normal requirement), followed by riboflavin, and vitamin C is also insufficient. Such severe vitamin deficiencies in food conditions are completely consistent with the poor nutritional conditions and high incidence of malnutrition diseases we found among the returning personnel.

Our captured personnel were in a long-term semi-starvation state in American POW camps, resulting in widespread malnutrition diseases. The Americans violated Article 26 of the Geneva Convention: "The daily basic rations in quantity, quality, and variety should be sufficient to maintain the health of the prisoners of war and prevent weight loss or malnutrition..." This is indisputable.

Chapter Seven: Tuberculosis Issues
Among the 567 returning internal medicine patients, 230 had tuberculosis. These cases were thoroughly examined, including detailed medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests (including sputum and erythrocyte sedimentation rate), and chest X-ray examinations. The types and activity levels of their tuberculosis can be explained by the following table:

Table 8: Classification of Tuberculosis

Note: The activity level of pulmonary tuberculosis lesions is classified based on the following standards:
1. Inactive: 1. X-ray shows that the lesions are mostly fibrotic or calcified; 2. No tuberculosis bacilli found in sputum; 3. Normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate; 4. No clinical signs of toxicity.
2. Mildly active: 1. X-ray shows some infiltrative lesions, not yet clearly fibrotic. 2. Tuberculosis bacilli may or may not be found in sputum. 3. Normal or slightly increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (first hour less than 30 mm). 4. Clinical signs of toxicity may or may not be present.
3. Severely active: 1. X-ray shows more infiltrative, caseous, or exudative lesions, with or without cavity formation. 2. At least one of the following conditions: a. Tuberculosis bacilli found in sputum; b. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate first hour exceeds 30 mm; c. Clinical signs of toxicity.

These 230 tuberculosis patients were investigated, and it was found that the occurrence and worsening of their symptoms were inseparable from the poor environment they experienced after being captured, before and during their illness (including non-tuberculosis patients living with tuberculosis patients), and the brutal treatment they received. The Americans' arbitrary inhuman treatment and brutality towards our captured personnel are extremely common phenomena, and patients are no exception. Among the 230 tuberculosis patients, 186 had been subjected to brutality before or during their illness; among them, 142 had pulmonary tuberculosis. More shocking is that the result of suffering inhuman treatment is that 46 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis lesions developed into severe active lesions. The following describes the situation:

One, Symptom Onset
As is well known, during World War II, the POW camps of the German and Japanese fascists were breeding grounds for tuberculosis. Malnutrition and poor living conditions promoted the occurrence and spread of tuberculosis. These poor conditions are fully present in American POW camps. Therefore, among the returning injured and sick personnel, a large number have tuberculosis. These 230 tuberculosis patients had no symptoms before being captured and developed symptoms only after a period of captivity. A few had mild coughs before being captured, but after being captured, their symptoms became significantly worse. Obviously, the clinical symptoms of tuberculosis in these patients occurred and worsened, and the direct cause was the inhuman treatment and various brutalities they received in the POW camps, such as beatings, torture, poison gas, excessive labor, starvation, thirst, and freezing. There are many examples of tuberculosis patients experiencing symptoms or worsening before being subjected to brutality. The following are four examples:

Case 26: Feng Nian (Feng Rizheng), male, 21 years old, captured on May 28, 1951.
Before capture, there were no respiratory symptoms. After capture, he was subjected to various poor treatments: he was forced to be branded, punished to crawl on sharp stones, and beaten. In September 1952, after being subjected to poison gas three times, he began to cough, producing foul-smelling yellow sputum with blood, and had chest pain. He sweated at night, lost weight, and was weak all over. In December 1952, after an X-ray examination, he was diagnosed with lung disease and transferred to Busan. After returning, he still had a cough, produced yellow sputum with blood, had chest pain, and had a fever up to around 38°C. Tuberculosis bacilli were found in his sputum. The chest X-ray showed multiple infiltrative lesions and cavities of varying sizes in the upper right lung and upper and middle left lung.

This case shows that after being captured for one year and four months, he was subjected to various poor treatments and brutalities, and after being subjected to poison gas, he developed symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis.

Case 27: Shao Zhengen, male, 30 years old, captured on May 27, 1951.
Before capture, there were no respiratory symptoms. After capture, he often suffered from hunger and cold. In October 1951, while doing labor in the 72nd battalion on Jeju Island, he was beaten in the chest. That night, he coughed up blood, had a cough, and produced sputum. Two days later, he was sent to the sixth "rest home" in Busan, and his symptoms gradually worsened. In January 1952, his cough worsened, he produced green, foul-smelling sputum, and had chest pain and fever. In April 1952, he coughed up blood again. In the "rest home," he continued to be subjected to brutality. After returning, he still had a cough, produced sputum, had a fever (around 38°C), and had chest pain. The X-ray examination found patchy infiltrates in both lungs, more severe in the upper and middle parts, with multiple small cavities. The left pleural and mediastinal pleura were thickened. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 60 mm in the first hour, and tuberculosis bacilli were found in the sputum.

This case shows that before capture, there were no symptoms, and after being subjected to brutality and beaten, he coughed up blood and developed other symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis.

Case 28: Wang Xuexin (Wang Xiaoxing), male, 29 years old, captured in May 1951.
Before June 1951, there were no respiratory symptoms. In June 1951, he was interrogated about whether he was a party member or cadre and was beaten with a wooden stick, immediately losing consciousness. After that, his whole body was swollen and painful, and after about 20 days, the swelling gradually subsided. He began to have a cough, palpitations, difficulty breathing, and produced yellowish-white sputum with blood streaks. In August 1951 and December 1952, he coughed up blood. He also had chest pain, fever, night sweats, loss of appetite, weight loss, fatigue, and weakness. In August 1951, after an X-ray examination, he was diagnosed with lung disease and sent to Busan. During his illness, he was subjected to brutality multiple times. After returning, he still had a cough, produced a large amount of sputum, had a fever, and had night sweats. The chest X-ray showed infiltrative lesions throughout both lungs, with multiple small cavities. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 58 mm in the first hour, and tuberculosis bacilli were found in the sputum.

This case shows that in the American POW camp, after being beaten, he developed symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis after about 20 days.

Case 29: Chen Qihou, male, 25 years old, captured on May 26, 1951.
Before September 1951, there were no respiratory symptoms. After capture, he often did labor and was beaten and kicked, even to the point of losing consciousness. He was once punished to crawl. In September 1951, while doing labor in the 86th battalion on Jeju Island, he was beaten all over with a wooden stick by American soldiers. At that time, he vomited blood and began to have severe coughing and produce a large amount of sputum. After that, his symptoms persisted, producing a large amount of foul-smelling yellow sputum, and had chest pain and fever. Every two to three months, he coughed up blood, each time for more than ten days. In November 1951, after a chest X-ray, he was sent to Busan. During his illness, he was subjected to starvation and thirst. After returning to the country, he still had a cough, produced a large amount of yellow sputum with blood, had chest pain, and had a fever. The chest X-ray showed large patchy infiltrates in the upper and middle parts of both lungs, with multiple cavities in the right lung lesions. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 34 mm in the first hour, and tuberculosis bacilli were found in the sputum. This case shows that the symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis occurred after being beaten.

Two, Brutality During Illness
Among the 167 pulmonary tuberculosis patients, 46 had severe active lesions (see Table 8). Analyzing the experiences of these 46 severe active pulmonary tuberculosis patients in the POW camps, it is clear why their conditions developed to such a severe degree.

Appropriate rest and better nutrition are the two most basic principles for treating pulmonary tuberculosis, which is universally recognized. However, how did the Americans treat these pulmonary tuberculosis patients? The Americans provided these patients with the same food as the general captured personnel, but this food was very poor (see Chapter 6). Such food is difficult to maintain the health of ordinary people, let alone promote the recovery of tuberculosis patients. The Americans did not provide these patients with appropriate rest; instead, they subjected these helpless, fragile patients to cruel brutality. Even after being diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis by American military doctors and sent to the "hospital" or "rest home," they still suffered brutality, which is an intolerable and inhumane act of cruelty. The following are three examples of severe active pulmonary tuberculosis patients who were subjected to various brutalities during their illness:

Table 9: 30 Severe Active Pulmonary Tuberculosis Patients Subjected to Brutality During Illness

In summary, we can confidently say that the extremely poor environmental conditions and inhumane brutalities in American POW camps promoted the occurrence and development of the aforementioned patients' tuberculosis. If the Americans had treated our captured personnel according to the Geneva Convention, their health conditions would not have been so poor. The aforementioned facts are sufficient to prove that the American POW camp authorities indeed violated the Geneva Convention, mistreated our captured personnel, and subjected them to cruel treatment even if they had serious illnesses.

Chapter Eight: Non-Tuberculosis Chronic Respiratory Diseases
The non-tuberculosis chronic respiratory diseases mentioned in this chapter refer to cases with the following conditions:
1. Respiratory symptoms for more than three months;
2. X-ray examination confirmed no tuberculous lesions in the lungs;
3. Abnormal chest signs;
4. Abnormal X-ray findings, such as emphysema, increased lung markings, and bronchiectasis.

All patients with cough, sputum, and hemoptysis had sputum examinations for lung fluke eggs, and those with positive results were not included in this group of cases.

The 292 non-tuberculosis respiratory disease patients all had at least the above two conditions, and many also had the third or fourth. They accounted for a significant percentage (18.1%) of the 1609 returning injured and sick personnel and more than half of the 567 internal medicine patients. Such a widespread occurrence of chronic respiratory diseases must have its causes.

One, Inducing Factors
The causes of respiratory diseases are numerous, with the most important being the patient's internal and external environment. These patients developed symptoms after being captured, and most had never had long-term respiratory symptoms. Some had a history of winter coughs, but had no symptoms before being captured. Whether their symptoms were new or recurrent, the inducing factors were inseparable from the poor living conditions, inhumane treatment, brutalities, psychological oppression, and other poor environments in American POW camps. Just in terms of brutality, various forms of persecution, including beatings, freezing, forced labor, confinement, water torture, poison gas, and pouring chili water, constituted the inducing factors for about 46% of the cases. After developing respiratory symptoms, these patients continued to be subjected to poison gas and various tortures, and some were even subjected to poison gas 10-20 times. They still had to do forced labor and eat food that was insufficient in quality and quantity. In such extremely unfavorable environments for physical and mental health, the high incidence of chronic respiratory diseases is not difficult to understand. The following cases can illustrate these facts.

Case 30: Shi Shihong, male, 24 years old, captured on December 8, 1950.
Before capture, there were no respiratory symptoms. In April 1952, he was beaten by four American soldiers. After being beaten, he had a severe cough, produced a large amount of white sputum, had chest pain, and was weak all over. The American military doctor listened to his chest and said he had tuberculosis. In the same year, he was sent to the eighth POW camp on Jeju Island and lived with tuberculosis patients, but did not receive any treatment. After returning, he still had a cough and chest pain, produced a large amount of sputum with blood streaks and a foul odor. The examination found no obvious abnormalities in the lungs. No tuberculosis bacilli were found in the sputum. The chest X-ray showed no solid lesions in both lungs, no tuberculosis was found, and there was increased lung markings, consistent with chronic respiratory disease.

This case shows that the patient developed respiratory symptoms after being beaten and later became chronic.

Case 31: Deng Xingcai, male, 24 years old, captured on May 26, 1951.
Before capture, there were no respiratory symptoms. In October 1951, in very cold weather, he was stripped of his clothes, exposed his upper body, and was confined in a wire cage for five and a half days. After being frozen, he immediately began to cough and produced black sputum. The sputum contained blood for several months; he also had chest pain, night sweats, weight loss, and weakness. The American military doctor listened to his chest and said he had tuberculosis, and sent him to the eighth POW camp on Jeju Island to live with tuberculosis patients, but did not provide appropriate treatment. After returning, he still had a cough, chest pain, produced black sputum with blood, and had a fever (around 38°C). The lung examination found no abnormalities, no tuberculosis bacilli were found in the sputum. The chest X-ray showed no tuberculosis, no solid lesions, and increased lung markings, more severe in the lower parts of both lungs, consistent with chronic respiratory disease.

This case shows that respiratory symptoms occurred after being frozen and are now chronic.

Case 32: Zhang Weifu, male, 30 years old, captured on January 7, 1951.
Since 1945, he had a cough in winter, which would heal in summer. After capture, he coughed all year round, but still did forced labor and was beaten with sticks multiple times and starved. On July 3, 1952, in the eighth POW camp on Jeju Island, he was subjected to poison gas and his cough worsened, producing blackish-yellow sputum, about 50 times a day, with blood. He had chest pain on both sides, loss of appetite, weight loss, fatigue, and weakness. After the chest X-ray, he was not told of any disease and was sent to live with tuberculosis patients. After returning, his cough improved, he produced about 10 times a day, the lungs showed high-pitched sounds, and there were dry and wet rales and wheezing in the lower back on both sides. No tuberculosis bacilli were found in the sputum. The chest X-ray showed increased lung markings throughout, with no solid lesions.

This case shows that respiratory symptoms worsened after being subjected to torture and poison gas.

Case 33: Sun Keyi, male, 30 years old, captured on August 24, 1951.
Since 1946, he had occasional mild coughs, but had no symptoms when captured. On September 18, 1951, he was interrogated by American soldiers and beaten with a wooden stick. He was tied to a cot and chili water was poured into his nose and mouth. After pouring a pot, he immediately lost consciousness. The next morning, the patient began to vomit blood, a total of seven times. After that, his sputum always contained blood. At the same time, his cough worsened, he produced a large amount of yellow sputum, and had chest pain, fever, and weight loss. In November 1951, the American military doctor took a chest X-ray and said the patient had "lung disease," and sent him to the fourth "rest home" in Busan to live with tuberculosis patients, and then transferred him to the eighth POW camp on Jeju Island.

After returning, he still had a severe cough, produced a large amount of sputum with a foul odor, and had chest pain and fever. The examination found dry and wet rales in the lower left lung. The chest X-ray showed no solid lesions in both lungs, but there was significant increased lung markings.

This case shows that respiratory symptoms occurred after being subjected to brutality and persisted for two years.

Case 34: Su Junyou, male, 26 years old, captured on October 15, 1951.
Before capture, he was healthy. In February 1952, while in the 86th battalion on Jeju Island, he was interrogated about whether he was a party or league member and was subjected to brutal torture. He was beaten with a two-foot-long stick on the chest and abdomen, immediately losing consciousness. After returning to the tent, he immediately felt pain in both sides of the chest, abdominal pain after eating, and had a cough, which later became persistent and worsened. He had a fever, chills, and night sweats. In March of the same year, he vomited blood for two days. The American military doctor took a chest X-ray and said he had tuberculosis, and performed two thoracentesis, each time draining a cup of bloody fluid.

After returning, he still had a cough, but it was lighter. He still had chest pain, better appetite, and increased weight. The examination found normal heart and lungs, no tuberculosis bacilli in the sputum. The chest X-ray showed no solid lesions in both lungs, and the right diaphragm was deformed like a tent, indicating pleural adhesions.

This case shows that the patient developed hemothorax after being beaten in the chest, and now has pleural adhesions.

Table 10: Statistics of Symptoms of Non-Tuberculosis Chronic Respiratory Disease Patients

Note:
1. The total number of people is 292, and the percentages in the table are percentages of the total number of people;
2. This item includes 23.3% of people with massive hemoptysis;
3. The total number of people with symptoms now is 262, accounting for 89%.

Two, Current Diagnosis
Based on the symptoms of the patients in captivity (see Table 10), we believe that the initial diagnosis of these cases was acute respiratory infections or respiratory injuries caused by brutality. For example, after being frozen, one can develop pneumonia or bronchitis; poison gas can cause bronchitis, pulmonary edema, and can lead to bronchopneumonia and lung abscess; chest injuries can cause pneumothorax, hemothorax, or pneumonia, etc. As is known, if acute respiratory diseases are treated appropriately, they generally will not become severe. However, when the body's resistance is low and the environment is poor, the lesions and symptoms can persist or worsen and become chronic.

The causes of chronic respiratory diseases are: 1. In clinical terms, delayed treatment or inappropriate treatment during the acute phase, especially uncontrolled infection, so that inflammation cannot be resolved in time; 2. In pathological terms, prolonged edema of the bronchial mucosa does not subside, resulting in retention of exudate, formation of granulation tissue and scar tissue, damage to the bronchial wall, invasion of lung parenchyma, and development of bronchiectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema, and other irreversible lesions. The extremely poor environment and irresponsible medical treatment in American POW camps promoted this series of worsening changes. More seriously, the patients not only did not receive reasonable rest and treatment but also continued to be subjected to persecution. After returning to their country, although they showed symptoms improvement after active treatment, 89.7% still had symptoms of varying degrees. Many still had hemoptysis or produced a large amount of sputum, and almost half still had chest pain. These symptoms are sufficient to indicate that their respiratory diseases had become chronic, and many had already developed bronchiectasis, even lung abscesses. The following two cases can illustrate:

Case 35: Zhang Dehai, male, 23 years old, captured on October 11, 1951.
Four years ago, he had a cough. After capture, he immediately developed a cough, which gradually worsened, had shortness of breath, produced a large amount of green, foul-smelling sputum, and had chest pain in the upper part, sometimes with a fever. The American military doctor took a chest X-ray and said he had tuberculosis, and sent him to live with tuberculosis patients. The patient still continued to be subjected to torture and brutality during his illness, such as forced labor, being kicked, beaten, and starved.

After returning, he still had shortness of breath and a cough. The amount of sputum was less, but it still had a foul odor. Sometimes he had a slight fever. The examination found bronchiectasis sounds and wheezing in the lower left lung. No tuberculosis bacilli were found in the sputum. The chest X-ray showed increased lung markings throughout, with some punctate infiltrates, and honeycomb shadows. These changes were most pronounced in the lower parts of both lungs, consistent with bronchiectasis.

This case shows that chronic respiratory disease developed into bronchiectasis during captivity.

Case 36: Gao Ziyi, male, 28 years old, captured on June 28, 1951.
In early 1951, he had a cough, which had healed by the time of capture. In November 1952, one year and five months after capture, he developed a cough and could not get out of bed, producing a large amount of green, foul-smelling sputum. He also had left chest pain and fever in the afternoon. During his illness, he was subjected to poison gas, and about a month after being subjected to poison gas, he began to vomit blood. The American military doctor did not provide any treatment.

After returning, he still had a cough and produced a large amount of sputum, and had a fever in the afternoon. The examination found dullness in the middle right lung, weak breathing sounds, and no rales. No tuberculosis bacilli were found in the sputum. The chest X-ray showed a large patchy dense shadow in the lower lobe of the right lung, with a cavity about 2x4 cm. There was pleural thickening and adhesions on the right side. The left lung was clear.

This case shows that the patient's respiratory disease, due to lack of treatment and being subjected to poison gas, had developed into chronic lung abscess.

Regarding the objective findings of these cases, such as many patients (28.1%) having abnormal chest signs, changes in breathing sounds, dry and wet rales, etc.; chest X-ray examinations, in addition to confirming no tuberculous lesions, some showed emphysema or bronchiectasis, and some showed increased lung markings. These all indicate that they have the signs of chronic respiratory diseases.

Three, Medical Treatment in POW Camps
The American POW camps' treatment of these respiratory diseases was extremely contrary to medical principles. About one-third of the patients never received any treatment, and very few received chemical or antibiotic treatment. Many were still forced to do labor and were subjected to poison gas and other persecutions. Almost two-thirds of the patients were sent to live with tuberculosis patients without thorough examination, and 64.3% of this group of patients received such "isolation." More absurdly, healthy captured personnel were sometimes forced to enter tuberculosis "rest homes." Conversely, some tuberculosis patients were ignored by American military doctors and continued to live with healthy people. In the so-called "rest homes," light and heavy patients lived together, tuberculosis patients and non-tuberculosis patients were not separated, and there was no talk of isolation, and there was a lack of necessary equipment and disinfection. The American military doctors concentrated these respiratory disease patients, only for convenience, without considering the risk of patients infecting each other. In such conditions, not only tuberculosis was easily spread, but other bacterial or viral infections were also easily spread. In this way, patients contracted secondary infections, worsened their conditions, prolonged their illness, and the harm they suffered was immeasurable. The following two cases illustrate the American military's random "isolation" of patients:

Case 37: Quan Hanji, male, 33 years old, captured on June 17, 1951.
Before capture, there were no respiratory symptoms. In August 1951, he began to have a cough, produced a large amount of white sputum, sometimes with blood streaks, and had left chest pain. He had a short-term fever. The American military doctor listened to his chest and said he had "third-stage lung disease," and immediately sent him to the fifth "rest home" in Busan for isolation. During his illness, he was beaten with sticks in November 1951 and February 1952, and his symptoms worsened after each beating. After returning, he still had a cough, produced white sputum, and had night sweats. The examination found slightly lower breathing sounds in the left lung. No tuberculosis bacilli were found in the sputum. The chest X-ray showed no solid lesions in the lungs, but there was emphysema.

This case shows that the American military doctor did not perform a thorough examination and sent a non-tuberculosis patient to be "isolated" as a tuberculosis patient.

Case 38: Li Xiaohong, male, 22 years old, captured on December 26, 1951, injured.
Before and after capture, there were no respiratory symptoms. In December 1951, he was illegally interrogated by American soldiers, tied to a cot, and beaten with a whip. In July 1952, while being forcibly "screened" in Busan, he was injured in the upper right arm by an American hand grenade, and was starved and thirsty for seven days. At that time, he still had no cough. In the same month, the American military doctor listened to his chest and said he had tuberculosis. He was immediately "isolated" in the eighth POW camp on Jeju Island and lived with tuberculosis patients. He did not receive any treatment but was subjected to various brutalities, such as being beaten, kicked, and subjected to poison gas. Before returning, he already had a cough and produced sputum, and had a fever in the afternoon, poor appetite, and weight loss. The examination found weakened breathing sounds in the upper right lung. No tuberculosis bacilli were found in the sputum. The chest X-ray showed increased lung markings in the upper right lung, with no obvious solid lesions.

This case shows that healthy captured personnel were randomly "isolated" by the American military doctors, and respiratory symptoms occurred.

In summary, we can say that the majority of the 292 non-tuberculosis chronic respiratory disease patients have already become disabled due to illness. The harm inflicted on them by the American POW camps is no less than amputation, and the long-term pain may be even greater, only the methods used are different. The conditions of these patients are evidence of the American military's mistreatment of our captured personnel.

Chapter Nine: Medical Evidence of American Brutalities
In this report, 1609 returning personnel were investigated, and almost everyone was subjected to one or more brutalities during captivity, including the use of clubs, iron rods, bayonets, submachine guns, machine guns, hand grenades, poison gas, armored vehicles, tanks, and other combat weapons, as well as burning, freezing, electric torture, water torture, cutting flesh, etc. This chapter uses medical facts to prove that American brutalities are indisputable. The content of this chapter is divided into two parts:

One, The Relationship Between Brutalities and Diseases
In the first batch of 350 returning internal medicine patients, we studied the relationship between the brutalities the patients experienced and the occurrence or worsening of diseases. During the study, we found that 347 people (99%) had been subjected to American brutalities during captivity. Each person was subjected to more than one brutality; in each brutality, multiple tortures were experienced. The following is a table of the brutalities they experienced, divided into pre-illness and during illness (Table 11):

Table 11: Statistics of Brutalities Experienced by 350 Internal Medicine Patients (Each brutality occurred more than once)

Note:
1. Forced labor: carrying heavy stones or wood, lifting large oil drums on ships, etc.
2. Confinement: the confinement room has no windows, the room is dark, and the air does not circulate.
3. The "other" category includes water torture, burning (burning skin, burning pubic hair, etc.), pouring water (cold water or chili water), inserting bamboo splinters under fingernails, branding with hot irons, etc.
4. The percentages are the number of people who experienced brutalities per 100 patients.

From the above table, it can be seen that many people were subjected to brutalities during their illness. The adverse effects of these brutalities on existing diseases are very significant, as mentioned in the chapter on internal medicine diseases.

Among various brutalities, poison gas had the most severe impact on diseases. Among the 350 internal medicine patients, 313 (89.4%) had been directly harmed by poison gas. Some patients were subjected to more than 20 times of poison gas, and generally, they were subjected to 3 to 10 times.

Two, Disabilities Caused by Brutalities
After detailed questioning and examination of 1172 returning injured personnel, it was found that 76 (6.5%) had scars and disabilities due to being subjected to brutalities. Among these 76 cases, 49 had scars of varying sizes, and 27 had disabilities of varying degrees. It is particularly noteworthy that among the 76 injured personnel, 40 were subjected to brutalities in the POW camps, and the remaining 36 were subjected to brutalities in hospitals or during transfers to hospitals. The following are examples:

One, Torture of Injured and Sick POWs: The Americans subjected severely injured POWs to torture, causing more disabilities. This can be illustrated by the following three cases:

Case 39: Liu Ling (formerly Liu Changyuan), unknown detention number.
On October 27, 1951, he was shot in the left upper arm, fracturing the humerus. On the same day, he was captured, but the Americans did not fix his injured limb; instead, they tied his wrists behind his back with wire and forced him to walk more than 10 miles before other captured injured personnel untied him. At that time, he immediately found that his left hand was swollen, cold, and numb. After that, the condition of his limb worsened day by day. After 20 days of injury, his forearm below the elbow had already turned black. He later underwent two amputation surgeries.

Case 40: Yang Qingfu, detention number 733236.
On June 16, 1953, he was injured in the left chest by an explosion, complicated by hemothorax, and had a gunshot wound in the right shoulder. One hour after the injury, he was captured. The Americans forced him to walk, but due to his severe injury, he could not walk. The Americans dragged him on the ground for about 2-3 miles, causing his head, back, right heel, and exposed skin to be scraped raw, leaving scars (see Figures 52A and 52B).

Case 41: Xie Chengjian, detention number 175613.
In 1949, his vision was normal. In April 1951, he was captured on the central line in Korea. He was first detained on Jeju Island and transferred to the eighth POW camp on Jeju Island in June 1952. In captivity, he ate coarse barley porridge and radish soup, often had abdominal pain and diarrhea, and was very weak. He repeatedly requested the American military doctor for examination and treatment, but was refused. In July 1952, he was forced to do labor, and because he walked too slowly, he was beaten in the left eye by the American supervisor with a stick. At that time, he lost consciousness for about half an hour. After regaining consciousness, his left eye was extremely painful. After two requests, he was given a tube of white ointment to apply himself. One and a half months later, the irritating symptoms subsided, and a white opacity appeared on the cornea, significantly reducing his vision. After returning to the country, the examination found that his left eye could only count fingers at a distance of one foot. In the center of the cornea, there was a round, adhesive, white spot about 5 mm in size (see Figure 53). The eye pressure increased.

The above Case 39 shows that intentionally tying the injured limb with a fracture, causing the fractured end to damage nearby blood vessels, resulting in limb necrosis and severe disability. Case 40 shows that the Americans, instead of treating and transferring the severely injured POWs, dragged them on the ground for 2-3 miles, not only causing new injuries but also worsening the original injuries.

In Case 41, the injured personnel were often sick and very weak in captivity. No one cared about his illness. In such a situation, he was still forced to do labor and was injured in the left eye by violence.

After the eye injury occurred, the American medical personnel ignored the patient's pain and the serious consequences and did not provide timely and effective treatment, resulting in near blindness in the left eye.

Two, Regarding Illegal Interrogations: The Americans violated the Geneva Convention and universally conducted interrogations to extract military information from POWs. During the interrogations, various punishments were often inflicted on POWs, including injured and sick POWs. The following are examples:

Case 42: Hao Duanhua (formerly Cai Shouzhong), unknown detention number.
In November 1951, he was injured in the left thigh and lower leg by an explosion, fracturing the lower third of the left femur and the left tibia and fibula. On the same day, he was captured and did not receive any treatment but was immediately interrogated. During the interrogation, he was beaten on the left thigh wound with a thick stick, and after being beaten 20 times, he lost consciousness. He was awakened with cold water and was beaten again, causing him to lose consciousness again. Two days later, the part of his left thigh wound below the knee turned black, and he later underwent two amputation surgeries.

Case 43: Sun Keyi, detention number 718251.
On August 24, 1951, he was captured. On September 18, he was illegally interrogated, tied to a cot with wire, and chili water was poured into his nostrils from a pot. Then, he was beaten in the abdomen with a stick and was hung upside down to pour out the chili water he had swallowed. During the interrogation, he lost consciousness several times. The next day, he began to vomit blood, a total of seven times. Now, there are still scars from the wire binding on his left upper arm.

The above Case 42 shows that due to illegal interrogations, the Americans inflicted torture on already injured POWs, resulting in unnecessary severe disabilities. Case 43 shows that although the injured personnel survived the torture, he suffered from a serious illness (vomiting blood seven times), and the scars remain to this day, serving as ironclad evidence of the brutality.

Three, Regarding Forced "Screening": The Americans, in order to achieve the goal of detaining our captured personnel, forced them to be branded with reactionary slogans on their arms and bodies. Those who refused to be branded were subjected to torture and beaten unconscious in front of other captured personnel before being branded, and some were even branded while under anesthesia and surgery. For example, Guo Liuqian (Case 596, detention number 733000) was branded with eight characters on his right upper arm during the transfer to the sickroom after undergoing bilateral lower leg amputation surgery in May 1952. Among the 76 returning injured personnel who were disabled due to brutalities, 12 were injured during forced "screening," such as:

Case 44: Hu Dezhong, detention number 712968.
During forced "screening," both lower limbs were injured by explosions, and the scars are still visible today (see Figure 5).

Case 45: Xu Chenggao (formerly Xu Baogong and Zhao Tiangao), detention number 730767.
This injured personnel was captured after being burned on the neck and both hands in early 1951. In late 1951, he was forced to be branded with reactionary slogans on his left upper arm. On April 8, 1952, during forced "screening," because he insisted on returning to his country, the part of his left upper arm with the characters was cut off with skin and flesh to intimidate other captured personnel (see Figure 57).

Four, Regarding the Brutalities on October 1, 1952: On the morning of October 1, 1952, at 7 am, the captured personnel in the "H" camp of the eighth POW camp on Jeju Island raised the national flag to commemorate the national day, and the American armed forces began to shoot at the POWs in the tents and on the camp grounds, resulting in many casualties. Among the 76 returning injured personnel who were disabled due to brutalities, 17 were injured in this incident. The following are two examples:

Case 46: Hu Tianyin (formerly Li Yue Liang), detention number 731113.
In this incident, his left side of the head was injured by a carbine bullet, fracturing the parietal and temporal bones. Now, there is a large defect in the parietal and temporal bones (see Figures 58A and 58B). The injured personnel has motor aphasia, resulting in severe disability.

Case 47: Zhang Guodong, detention number 708313.
In this incident, his left shoulder was injured by a gunshot, fracturing the left humerus and left scapula. Now, the shoulder joint has completely lost its function, resulting in severe disability (see Figures 59A, 59B, and 59C).

Summary:
The brutalities inflicted by the Americans on our unarmed captured personnel are extremely cruel and shocking. The injuries and disabilities of the injured personnel are ironclad evidence of the brutalities they suffered.

Chapter Ten: Conclusion
In summary, based on the examination results of the aforementioned 1609 returning injured and sick personnel, and based on humanitarianism and medical principles, we have conducted in-depth analysis and research and reached the following conclusions.

In the treatment of surgical war injuries, the most prominent manifestation is the deliberate sacrifice of the limbs of captured injured personnel, unreasonable amputations, and high amputations. Early war injuries were not treated in time, and no debridement was performed. Fractures were not fixed during transport. In the rear hospitals, fractures were not repositioned or formally fixed. Surgical indications were unreasonable, and deformities were not prevented. For other war injuries, such as eye injuries, in emergency situations, timely treatment was not provided to relieve the patient's pain, and measures were not taken to prevent sequelae. These evil acts, of course, resulted in a large number of disabilities. As for delayed treatment, lack of care, etc., it is beyond description. This so-called "treatment" not only violated the principles of war injury treatment but also violated humanitarianism.

Among the 567 internal medicine patients, 92% had chronic respiratory diseases. Among them, 71% of tuberculosis cases were active; among non-tuberculosis patients, about 90% still had various respiratory symptoms after returning. These numbers are shocking. The occurrence and worsening of these patients' symptoms are directly or indirectly related to the living conditions, inhumane treatment, and brutalities in American POW camps. For example, just in terms of nutrition, widespread malnutrition, especially protein and various vitamin deficiencies, is already sufficient to induce these respiratory diseases. Many patients could not rest after falling ill, did not receive timely diagnosis, did not receive timely and reasonable treatment, and continued to be subjected to various tortures and persecutions (including poison gas attacks), even those in "rest homes" were not exempt. All our captured personnel, including injured and sick personnel, ate food that was far below the minimum standard in quality and quantity, resulting in widespread malnutrition among the captured personnel.

The so-called "rest homes" in POW camps were simply a random gathering of injured and sick personnel, with no talk of rest and treatment, let alone isolation. Under such conditions, injured and sick captured personnel, even if they escaped death, became chronic patients.

Today, we see that the various disabilities and chronic diseases of our captured personnel are ironclad evidence of the Americans' mistreatment and persecution of our POWs, and a specific explanation of the Americans' violation of the 1949 Geneva Convention on the Treatment of POWs. We have the responsibility to expose and condemn from the perspective of medicine and humanitarianism to the world.

    第十章  结论
    第一章  绪言
    一九五三年四月十一日朝鲜停战谈判的双方在板门店签定了交换伤病战俘的协议，第一批中国人民志愿军伤病被俘人员回到祖国怀抱。当他们见到祖国人民向他们进行慰问的时候，他们都抱着无比愤怒的心情，控诉在被俘期间所遭受的无比痛苦和伤病迄未得到适当处理的情形。
    在七月二十七日朝鲜停战协定签字之后，八月初旬又有一批中国人民志愿军的伤病被俘人员归来。这批伤病人员大部分是应该在四月间遣返的，却被美方违反协定扣留了三、四个月。同时归来的“非伤病”人员中，有107人发现也有伤病，因而和伤病员一起收容在医院内治疗。总计前后两批共有住院伤病员1，609名。为了解决伤病归来人员的医疗问题本会特聘请了富有经验的各专科医师及专家进行了关于他们健康情况的调查研究。
    归来人员营养情况的恶劣是普遍的现象。因此我们除伤病员外另检查了八月初归来的一批非伤病人员1，045名。目的是为了彻底了解一般被俘人员的营养及健康情况，以便提出具体办法，使他们早日恢复健康。
      1，609名伤病员中1，172例患外科疾病，567例患内科疾病（兼患内科和外科疾病者有225人，所以同时列在内外两科内），患其他疾病者95例（包括精神病患者35例）。
    在1，172例外科伤员中，已形成不同程度的残废者有840例之多。其中至少有135例，其造成残废的责任肯定的应由美方来负。截肢不当是造成残废的主要原因。美方对于许多战伤的处理是违反医学原则的。从现存的恶果就可以看出美方是如何有意识的进行着罪恶的行为。
    内科病员567人几乎都是慢性病患者，他们之中除31例是消化系疾患，另14例是其他疾患外，绝大多数（92％）患有慢性呼吸系疾患，其中结核性患者230人，非结核性患者292人。分析他们患病的情况，我们可以很清楚地看出美方战俘营中的生活待遇是极端恶劣的。他们的疾病情况，也正是美国军事当局迫害中国人民志愿军被俘人员的罪证。
    以下各章分别说明这些问题。
    第二章  骨与关节战伤医疗问题
    在1，172名归来伤员中637名有骨与关节伤（710肢体）。详细研究他们在被俘期间所受的治疗，我们看到美方军医的不可饶恕的错误。这些错误可分下列五类来说明：
    1．无适当的初期手术治疗；
    2．骨折固定不充分或完全无固定；
    3．骨折复位不够；
    4．不合理的推拿造成再骨折；
    5．不合理的截肢。
    一、无适当的初期手术治疗：
    在710肢体开放性骨关节伤中，除81肢体因俘前已受治疗或被俘时意识不清伤员不知道初期治疗情况者外，其余629肢体中仅214肢（34％）在被俘后七天内得到手术治疗；而有415肢体（66％）没有得到初期外科手术治疗。
    第一例病历号146刘文财（又名刘文喜）拘留号730247。
    一九五一年三月三日右脚蹠部炸伤，十二小时后被俘，伤口包扎，未作固定。被俘后六天未受任何处理。到釜山又过三天仅行石膏固定，但伤口未受任何手术治疗。因之感染扩大，四、五趾已溃烂被剪去，其他三趾并未变色。于一九五一年五月从踝部截肢。感染仍未停止，后在小腿下三分之一处再行截肢。
    按该伤员，系在伤后十二小时被俘，这是最适宜于作扩创术的时候，美方军医不早期行扩创术，也不固定，即将之运转到后方医院。到医院后，仍不及时手术，拖延三天后仅打上石膏，以致感染扩大。对于感染也不给与适当治疗，仅以截肢及再截肢为治疗的主要方式。
    二、骨折固定不充分或完全无固定：
    所有肢体的骨和关节战伤应作运输固定，特别在下肢是非常重要的。在归来伤员中有483下肢骨折。其中210例（43．5％）无任何运输固定。
    甚至在后方的釜山战俘“医院”，骨折也常常没有行后期固定，有些固定亦很不充分。在710例骨折肢体中有175肢固定不充分或竟完全无固定。
    第二例  病历号450蔺太贤（曾用名蔺太显）拘留号706463。
      一九五一年五月二十二日左踝部及右脚跟炸伤，自行包扎。两天半后被俘。左踝化脓严重，肿胀生蛆。后作切开引流术，术后未作任何固定。约二十日后，即被迫起床走路，乃发生再骨折，仍未给予固定。约二个月后，又强令走路活动，伤口因而感染加重。此后又行两次手术，经一年始终未与任何固定，故引起严重畸形。（见图1）
    适当固定预防畸形是在骨关节战伤治疗中一个基本的要求。由此例子可以看出美方军医违反此一原则未与任何固定。
    第三例  病历号1366  严铜山（曾用名尹栋生）拘留号706353。
    一九五一年一月十一日受枪伤，左小腿下部胫骨骨折。被俘后美方未予扩创，换药后用一膝下石膏固定。到釜山后两个月未得到处理，创口化脓生蛆，才拆去石膏换药。同年八月十日取腐骨一次，随后也未用任何固定。至今骨断端尚未接连。（见图2）
    小腿下三分之一骨折未作扩创，听其感染扩延。仅用不能充分固定的膝下石膏固定，且两个月即拆去，因而至今遗留不接连的骨断端。
    第四例  病历号573  刘玉春  拘留号70
  6417。
    一九五一年五月右上臂受枪伤，肱骨骨折。三小时后被俘。在大田手术后将右前臂紧贴胸壁作石膏固定。转到釜山两月后始拆除石膏。右肩挛缩不能外展。
    按胸肱式石膏固定，仅可作为暂时性运输固定，这种固定，在釜山美方“医院”却一直被保留，作为肱骨骨折之正规治疗。结果形成伤员肩关节内收挛缩，造成不应有的残废。
    三、骨折复位不够：
    在637名骨与关节战伤伤员中，583名
  （91 ．5％）已形成不同程度的残废（此外有11名尚在治疗中，其结果不能确定）。583名中有231名是骨折畸形愈合。从这样的结果，让人怀疑美方军医是否对我方被俘人员之骨折进行复位。由下面这些骨折X线像片，可看出美方军医治疗骨折的一般情况（图3——图15）。
      在153股骨骨折中，130肢（85％）未行牵引，有七例曾用内固定。16例曾试用过牵引，但这些牵引亦有很多错误。
    第五例  病历号51  高云成  拘留号730215。
    一九五二年十月一日在济州岛战俘营，被美军故意用步枪打伤，右股骨在下三分之一处骨折。送到釜山“医院”手术，未整复仅以髋人字型石膏固定。
    现右腿短5．5公分，有严重角形畸形（见图16）。
    一般治疗股骨骨折，悬吊牵引是保持骨折复位的重要方法。在美国一九五一年四月份之“骨与关节外科杂志”中，前美军医上校克利夫兰（M·cleveland）等人所著之一篇文章中，说到在医院及兵站医院中治疗骨折时，有如下的话：“股骨、胫骨、腓骨、肱骨等骨折应以骨牵引治疗之，每例必须施行相当的时间始可得到满意的结果。骨牵引应保持到骨折两端已充分安定，不会再变位或不致变成角形畸形之后……”
    由此例可见美方军医并未按他们自己所提出的原则去治疗中国人民志愿军被俘人员。
    第六例  病历号648  高其芳  拘留号730269。
      一九五一年五月二十八日受枪伤，右大腿下部骨折。被俘后六月一日在釜山上髋人字型石膏，并在跟部穿一钉施行牵引，半月后去钉停止牵引。再七十天后拆去石膏。现股骨折虽已愈合，但右腿仍短五厘米，膝关节运动至今还受限制。
    本例说明如此的“牵引”，很明显是不合理的，也不能使骨折复位。
    第七例  病历号519  张英。
    一九五二年十月三日右股骨受枪伤骨折。被俘后径扩创，用髋人字型石膏固定后转送釜山。在十一月初将伤口作晚期缝合。但在缝合后十天伤口将愈合时，即做切开复位，将骨折用两钢板做内固定。结果术后即复发感染。至今股骨尚有广泛性骨髓炎，骨断端仍未愈连。（图17）
    此例说明在感染仍有复发可能时，即违反野战外科原则粗率的切开复位，施行内固定，致引起非常不良的结果。
    四、不合理的推拿造成再骨折：
    第八例  病历号1277  耿兆廷（曾用名康成丁）拘留号706268。
    于一九五一年二月右臂枪伤肱骨骨折，当日被俘。在前方作扩创并上石膏固定。到釜山“医院”三日后换石膏。三个月后去石膏时骨折已愈合，但肘关节僵直。五日后被四人强力进行推拿。当时将骨折断，伤员自己听到响声。此后即肿，十余日后始消退。再照X线像后又上石膏。
    由此例可说明美方军医在治疗上不遵守关节僵直不可强力活动之原则。肘部去石膏后运动障碍，不使其自动练习，逐渐恢复；而竟违反原则，猛力推拿，以致引起再骨折。与此同样之情形在骨关节伤员中发现还有五例之多。共有肱骨再骨折二例，股骨再骨折四例。
    五、不合理的截肢：
    第九例  病历号152  聂明银（曾用名聂廷）拘留号780077。
    一九五一年四月二十九日受炸伤被俘。右小腿中部骨折，右脚三、四、五趾炸掉。伤后五小时受手术。是时右脚未变色，踝关节及余下的趾都能运动。麻醉醒后发现右大腿已在膝上被截掉。
    此例说明早期战伤骨折既无气性坏疽，又无主要血管损伤症状，竟以早期高位截肢来代替初期处理。与此类似之例甚多。在637例骨与关节战伤中，因骨关节战伤而被截肢者，竟有128名。此实为罪恶的行为。截肢问题为一突出之问题，将在第四章中再详细分析。
    小结：
    一、骨关节战伤伤员637名中，未受初期扩创术者占66．0％。
    二、下肢开放性骨折483伤肢中无运输固定者占43．5％。
    三、153股骨开放性骨折中未受过牵引者有85％。
    四、在637例骨与关节战伤中，有509例尚可进行检查骨折愈合情形者，（128例已截肢无法检查者除外）其中竟有231例为畸形愈合。
  （45．4％）
    五、因强力推拿造成再骨折者有六名。
    六、在637名骨关节战伤中，被手术截肢者128名，即占20％。（创伤性截肢者尚未计算在内。）
    第三章  冻伤治疗及俘后冻伤问题
    在1172名外科归来伤员中曾因冻伤在釜山美方战俘“医院”治疗者共139名。其中大多数人均已失掉肢体变成残废。我们对之深入的进行了研究，借以进一步了解我方被俘人员在战俘营中所受的医疗情况。
    在139名冻伤归来人员中有六名在同一肢体上合并有火器伤，且以该火器伤为主要伤情，因此不在冻伤医疗问题中研究。本章研究之对象总人数则为133人，计有276只冻伤肢体。（其中尚包括14肢体并有小火器伤，但该肢之伤情仍以冻伤为主。）（见表1）
    表一  冻伤人数与肢体（归来伤员总数为1172人）
    注：※包括14肢并有火器伤。
    一、冻伤之治疗情况与结果
    美方军医治疗我方被俘人员之冻伤，绝大部分毫无积极合理之促进局部血液循环措施，而竟不待坏死分界即粗率地施行截肢，而截肢部位多远超过其应截之部位之上。今先举两例说明如下：
    第十例  病历号656  赵景隆（曾用名单真理）拘留号702970。
    一九五一年二月肩部受贯通枪伤，伤后自己步行退下火线，途中晕倒，醒后不能继续行走，三天后两足冻红，七天后被俘。两周后即将两小腿同时在下三分之一处截肢。截肢前右足足趾发红，足背稍肿而不红，未破；左足五趾干黑，截肢后伤口当时缝合，十天拆线，伤口一星期愈合。
    第十一例  病历号138  李勤  拘留号706317。
    一九五一年一月胸、额及右足跟等部受炸伤当即不能行动。两天后被俘，运至釜山。左足足趾变黑，蹠部生泡并有溃烂。到釜山四十八小时之内即由美方军医做左小腿中三分之一部截肢。伤口缝合，一星期愈合。
    以上两例中第十例伤员之冻伤局部感染并不严重，右足尚无坏死，左足坏死亦只限于足趾。实只应切除左足之坏死足趾。而美方军医竟断然在高位截肢牺牲了双足。第十一例说明美方军医不待冻伤坏死之分界，即早期做高位截肢。类似上述高位截肢一期缝合者很多。虽然如此，并不能保证截肢端一期愈合，事实证明常有伤口因再感染裂开，骨端露出，以致再截三截，越截越高。请看下面统计数字，更为清楚。
    133名冻伤归来伤员之治疗结果为：截肢及坏死组织切除者共119名，占89．5％；无残疾者仅14名，占10．5％。（见表2）。
    表二  冻伤归来伤员133名治疗结果
    注：※此表中人数系以主要残废情况计算，如一人同时有两肢冻伤，两肢中有一肢截肢，另肢切除坏死组织，则此人以截肢计人数。
    按冻伤坏死之处理原则应为“高度保守性”，只宜在坏死分界后将坏死部分切除，任何超过自然坏死分界之截肢均属不合原则。在美方军医治疗下，133名冻伤中竟有70％在坏死组织以上截肢，是为违反“高度保守性”之原则。一九五一年十一月美国军医署鲍尔（Bower）上校在美国“外科妇产科杂志”93卷529页发表了“六个月的朝鲜战伤情况的研究”一文，特别强调了“高度保守性”的原则。文中报告630例冻伤中仅87例（13．8％）截肢。与我方被俘人员70％被截肢之情况对比，则可明显的看出美方对战俘的歧视，违反医疗的科学原则和人道主义。
    再进一步研究冻伤截肢之部位，更可具体看出治疗冻伤违反“高度保守性”原则的严重情况。
    为了便于分析，避免其截肢部位可能受冻伤以外之其他原因影响，故将并有火器伤者除去，仅对下肢截肢之139只纯冻伤肢体进行分析。（见表三、四，图20）
    表三  冻伤治疗结果
    注：※此表显示139肢体纯冻伤下肢截肢占冻伤总肢数之绝大部分。
    又为了便于表明冻伤截肢部位，兹将下肢分为九节如图19。
    （截肢部位节位）
    表四  冻伤部位与截肢部位表（下肢139肢体）
    图20冻伤超位截肢（下肢—139肢）
    从表四及图20可以看出139只下肢冻伤截肢中有118肢（84．9％）之截肢均超过应截部位一节以上，其中超过应截部位二节截肢者有28肢（20．2％），超过应截部位四节截肢者有24肢（17．3％），甚至竟有超过五节者。
    按一般冻伤限于足趾时，在尽量保留肢体之原则下仅切除足趾或甚至在蹠部截断，则该伤员尚可不需假肢行路；若高至小腿截肢，则必需装按假肢方可行路。
    但由表四及图21中可以看到81肢足趾冻伤而在小腿截肢者竟有39肢，占48．2％。
    由以上各例及分析，可以清楚的看出美方治疗我方被俘人员之冻伤时竟如此的故意增加他们的残废程度。
    二、俘后发生之冻伤
    在133名冻伤伤员中有十名系在美方战俘营或“医院”中冻伤的。按在寒冷环境下，伤员被俘后运送途中，如因为当时条件困难，有时使战场上已得的冻伤加重，或更发生新的冻伤，这种情形的责任问题姑且不论。但如果伤员在被俘时原无冻伤，而在战俘营中或是在有医护人员照顾之下的医院里发生了冻伤，则拘留方当局应负责任。今举两例如下。
    第十二例病历号237  蔡茵浦  拘留号703288。
      一九五一年二月左足被炮弹炸掉，左肩部炸伤。被俘后运至釜山，三天后由美方军医做左小腿下三分之一截肢。右足正常。因该伤员的床位靠近帐篷边，而帐篷又未钉住，刮风时人及病床均露于篷外。该伤员手术后不能转动，因而右足被冻坏。约三十天后即由美方军医自右小腿下三分之一处截肢。截肢时仅足趾发黑，足背稍肿。
    第 十三例  病历号773  方培德  拘留号734581。
    一九五一年六月被俘。同年冬季在巨济岛86联队时着单衣被强迫服劳役，因无鞋光脚在雪地行走，而致右?趾被冻坏破烂。
    以上两例中，第十二例说明美方战俘医院对重伤战俘毫无护理致使伤员在“医院”病床上发生冻伤，并且毫无原则的高位截肢。第十三例说明被俘人员无御寒鞋袜。被迫在雪地中劳役，以致发生严重冻伤。美国军事当局之虐待战俘显然可见。
    小结：
   一、133名归来冻伤员中有70％在坏死以上部位截肢，说明美方军医在治疗我方被俘人员冻伤时违反对冻伤应“高度保守性”之外科医疗原则。
    二、81只肢体仅有足趾冻伤者，其中39肢竟在小腿截肢，进一步说明故意的加重了我方被俘人员之残废。
    三、在朝鲜战场美军冻伤治疗结果之截肢率为百分之13．8，而我方被俘人员之冻伤美方治疗结果截肢率为70％，对比之下，说明美方对中国人民志愿军被俘人员之医疗待遇极不人道。
    四、俘后在战俘营或战俘“医院”里伤员竟发生严重冻伤，再一次证实我方被俘人员所受之非人道的生活待遇。
    图21  81肢足，趾冻伤之截肢部位
    第四章  截肢问题
    从美方军医处理战伤与冻伤的方法中，发现了一个非常突出的现象，就是他们摈弃了一切公认的战伤处理原则而动辄以截肢为处理四肢战伤之主要治疗方式。必须指出这个现象是普遍的，而不是个别的。从医学观点来说，用截肢术作为处理战伤的主要手段，是原始式的，非科学的。从人道主义观点来说，任意截肢是残暴和忽视人道的表现。有很多例不应有的痛苦结果和不该牺牲的肢体，应归罪于美方军医。他们贪图省事或处理方便，而把可保留的肢体截去了。至于真正的原因，只有他们自己知道。我们认为他们这种作法，是不人道的，是不合乎医学道德的。截肢术之如此滥用，值得我们进一步对之分析研究。
    在1172名归来伤员中，有261名曾经受过手术截肢，失去的肢体有360只。换句话说，有很多人失去了一个以上的肢体。这个数字是惊人的。在我们谨慎的分析及研究了他们的病历后，至少有98名伤员（114肢）其所以致成残废应完全由美方军医负责。（有些人过去的伤情病史不十分详尽，暂不能研究其责任问题。）兹将全部截肢中的错误，分为下列三项来说明：
    1、可避免的截肢；
    2、高位截肢；
    3、无故（罪恶）截肢。
    一、可避免的截肢
    在错误截肢114肢中，至少有91肢是完全可以避免的。包括原始伤情无主要血管损伤或气性坏疽，但未经任何治疗以设法保存肢体，即断然截肢做为初期手术处理者。
    第十四例  病历号489  王用琪  拘留号730300。
    一九五一年五月二十六日晨一时，右小腿下三分之一受枪伤后骨折，入口直径二厘米，出口直径四厘米。晨六时被俘。当日下午六时，即伤后十八小时在美军前方医院在右大腿下三分之一处截肢。术前在手术室内剃毛准备手术时，伤员看到伤口无异常，未化脓，足部皮肤颜色及知觉正常，不发烧。
    按本例系右小腿下三分之一开放性骨折，在伤后十八小时作膝上截肢。这种做法肯定的是违反公认的战伤治疗原则。根据该人之伤情及受伤后之时间，合理的初期治疗应当是早期扩创后用石膏固定。但美方军医无适当指征即作高位截肢。
    第十五例  病历号104  牛福有  拘留号712550。
    一九五一年五月右大腿中三分之一贯通枪伤，股骨骨折，入口直径约二厘米，出口直径约四厘米。七天后被俘，到釜山初次手术后上人字形石膏。此后伤口化脓生蛆，十分严重。伤员多次要求检查并抓了些爬出来的蛆给美方军医看，但美方军医仍置之不顾。四个月后拆去石膏时，腿的皮肤已溃烂。足跟足底也有许多溃疡。但未经石膏遮盖的脚趾皮肤颜色仍正常，足趾活动良好。经二十余天换药后美方军医却将右大腿由上三分之一截去。又一个多月后再次截肢。现在右股骨残端，只剩大粗隆之一部。
    伤员住在釜山战俘“医院”，让蛆在石膏下繁殖四个月之久，证明美方军医完全忽视了感染伤口的处理问题。本例截肢似系为了并发的浅在感染，这本来可以用保守疗法来控制，不应该截肢。
    我们看一看美方军医所说的截肢指征。前美国陆军军医上校克利夫兰（Cleveland）及曼宁（Manning）斯图尔特（Stwart）等在美国一九五一年四月份“骨与关节外科杂志”第33卷第二号，“骨与关节战伤之处理”一文中有以下一段：
    “一、师级机构之治疗方式……
    5、截肢——前方医疗机构，不得进行截肢，除非肢体已近完全失连者……
    二、军级机构之治疗方式……
    5、截肢
    1截肢指征
    甲、血循环完全破坏，即主要血管损伤同时有侧枝循环损伤。
    乙、弥散性气性坏疽……。
    很显然，美方军医在治疗我方负伤被俘人员时，完全违反了这些原则。
    二、高位截肢
    美方军医在治疗我方被俘人员战伤与冻伤时尚不止于截肢太多，而且截的部位太高，因而牺牲了很多有用的关节及骨的长度。为了说明这一事实，可将上下肢各分为九节如图24、25。将截肢在伤口以上所牺牲之节数加以分类，并作图以说明美方军医对我方被俘伤员之高位截肢的情况（见图26、27）。为此我们分析了59上肢截肢和297下肢截肢的情况。（另有四肢截肢位在原伤以下者未列在内）。
    如图27所示，在297下肢截肢中，只六五例在原伤位施行截肢。大部分截肢均系高位。一半以上之病例截肢部位均超过了较伤位高二节以上，其中超过四节以上者竟有34例。甚至还有超过七节者。图26示上肢截肢情况，超过应截部位一节以上者占百分之五八。但其情节更为恶劣，因指伤而高位截肢失去全手者，其问题之严重性非常明显，无须加以阐明。
    图26上肢截肢超过原伤位情况
    图27下肢截肢超过原伤位情况
    以高位截肢来治疗战伤及冻伤即是破坏了公认的医疗原则。但在高位截肢手术后，由于对残端处理不良，以致再截肢，因而损失了残肢的长度。在218例开放截肢术后，仅有65例曾有皮肤牵引，甚至包括不合理牵引在内。兹举三例说明高位截肢的情况。
    第十六例  病历号261  王昌孩拘留号780298。
    一九五一年五月二十四日，机枪伤右足后被俘。被俘后十余天未得任何处理，也无人照管。而第一次处理即在右大腿上三分之一截肢。截肢时右脚前半部肿且变黑，但有两个足趾还能活动。患者尚能用手撑在床边，以足跟着地慢慢移步。手术前皮肤之准备工作范围仅限于小腿，但手术却在大腿上部截肢。截后残端开放，未牵引，以致骨断端突出。两个多月后又截去一部分骨端。现在右大腿残端长度，自大粗隆只有三公分。（见图28）
    按伤员被俘后十余日不加处理，已属甚不应该。前半足受伤，踝及小腿无感染现象，在患者尚能用脚跟着地步行之情况下，美方军医竟将伤肢在大腿上部截去。更有甚于此者，截肢后不加牵引，以致还要再截肢，使患者遭受更多的痛苦，损失了骨的长度。我们不能不质问美方军医这种“治疗”的目的何在。
    第十七例  病历号675  胡相银拘留号700327。
    一九五○年十二月四肢冻伤后被俘。到釜山二十天后，第一次手术即将两小腿在中三分之一部截肢，右手在腕上截肢。术后缝合，伤口一周后初期愈合。手术前伤情，仅十趾坏死，足背虽稍红肿，但未烂，未起泡，足跟仍可着地承重。右手拇指及小指坏死。食指、中指和无名指仅黑到近侧指骨中部，坏死部干燥。
    左手指有同样冻伤并有感染，患者坚决拒绝截肢，故仅将坏死组织切除（见图29）。
    本例冻伤限局于手指及足趾，坏死部分枯干。很明显，合理的治疗应只限于坏死部切除。但美方军医竟将四肢中之三肢截去，违反了他们自己所提倡的“高度保守”的原则。
    第十八例  病历号55  杨同礼（曾用名黄生亮）拘留号730759。
    一九五一年五月右小腿及踝部软组织弹片伤，无骨伤，仍能走路。四五天后又被飞机炸伤右足趾部，将骨炸坏。伤后十日被俘，即转运釜山。抵釜山即在大腿中三分之一部截肢（见图30）。
    该伤员之右足是应该可以保留的，特别是右膝关节，根本不应当截掉。
    上面我们揭露了美方军医一般是在超过应截部位之高位截肢。至少有21个肢体因截的部位太高而严重影响了残端的功能或增加了残废的程度。在前节所述可避免截肢的91个肢体中，即有74肢是属于高位截肢的。但既然根本不应该截肢，也就无须再来批判其截肢部位的高低了。我们再看一看美方军医他们自己如何谈到截肢的部位问题：
  （摘自前述克利夫兰上校著文）
    “军级医疗机构之处理
      （五）截肢……
    2、截肢之部位高低——截肢部位应按伤口之性质及情况，尽可能在最低处施行。
    3、截肢方式——根据经验，开放环截式是我们治疗战伤所选择的方法。
    4、开放环截之操作法……
    K、截后应立刻做皮肤牵引，并一直继续牵引于运输途中，直至愈合时为止。”
    三、无故（罪恶的）截肢
    本类包括毫无理由的截肢，这种截肢是在医学上难以找出截肢的原因者。
    第十九例  病历号52  张华生拘留号730242。
    一九五一年五月二十五日右大腿下三分之一及右小腿软组织贯通伤，无骨折。伤后自行包扎伤口，仍能步行三日，翻过一个上下约百余里的山头。伤后三日被俘，被送往美军前方医院。途中上下汽车时均不需扶持。到达医院后该伤员即被注射一针，服了一粒药，随即失去意识。醒后发现右大腿已在膝上截去（见图31）。
    该伤员肯定的没有骨折，没有大血管或神经伤，也没有严重感染，否则他不可能走一百余里翻过一个山头。所以这种截肢是完全没有道理的，是罪恶的。
    第二十例  病历号182  梁庆辉拘留号719717。
    一九五二年九月二十五日上午五时，左手食指及中指在近指节受轻机枪伤。伤指几已脱落。下午二时被俘，下午八时被送至一美军医院。次日下午二时，即伤后三十三小时，未经任何术前准备即被送入手术室作前臂截肢。术时伤情：手颜色正常仅有轻度肿胀。拇指无名指及小指均无伤。
    按该患者仅食指及中指受伤，其余诸指无伤，早期手术应限于坏死部分切除。美方军医竟无视尚未受伤之手指，而将该手在腕上截去。对于重要的可以工作的手来说，这不仅是高位截肢，这是罪恶性的宰割。
    小结：
    （一）美方军医在处理战伤和冻伤时，竟以截肢为其主要治疗手段。
    （二）因美方军医此种罪恶的行为至少有一一四肢不该截肢者。美方应负责任。
    （三）大部分截肢部位均取高位，因此牺牲了可以保留的关节和骨的长度。
    （四）截肢术之施行，甚至有毫无医学根据而施行者。
    第五章  其他战伤医疗问题
    美方军医在治疗战俘时不顾伤员痛苦，摧残伤员之情况，不仅限于以上曾经讨论过的骨与关节、冻伤和截肢问题，在其他战伤治疗中也有同样情况。以下举例说明：
    第二十一例  病历号1499  孙柏拘留号731554。
    一九五一年十月中旬左胸部受枪伤，第二天早晨被俘。到釜山作第一次手术。手术后继续发烧、咳血、伤口漏气。二个月后又做第二次橡皮管引流术。以后三个月内征状仍未减轻又做第三次手术——肋骨切除，并继续保持胸腔引流。术后三星期咳血停止，但是伤口仍继续漏气。六月间换药时，即住院八个月后，由伤口取出两块弹片，又过二月后伤口才完全愈合。回国后检查左胸壁外侧中部凹陷。呼吸时胸壁扇动。伤员经常每分钟呼吸三十多次，稍用力后即呼吸频率增加并表现有呼吸困难症状。X线照像显示左胸第六和第七肋骨全部缺损，第五肋骨部分缺损。肋膜只轻度增厚。（见图33A．B．C）
    美方军医在这例治疗中所犯错误有以下三点：
    1、第一次和第二次手术不当。如果美方军医在这两次手术中取出异物并且达到充分引流目的，则伤员之慢性脓胸应可避免。
    2、肋膜增厚未达足够程度前即作广泛的肋骨切除术，违反了胸腔外科原则因而造成现在呼吸困难情况。
    3、手术后既然造成了严重呼吸障碍，但在一年余时间内美方军医竟未作任何适当处理以减少伤员之痛苦，甚至于一个简单的加压棉垫也未用。
    第二十二例  病历号518  王全拘留号706386。
    一九五一年二月右下肢炸伤（大腿上三分之一软组织伤，小腿上三分之一开放性胫腓骨骨折），同时两足足趾冻伤。伤后五天被俘，送至釜山战俘医院。右小腿曾手术十五次，其中十一次手术是在相隔二至三星期内做的。第十四次手术时又将腓总神经切断，因而造成右足瘫痪下垂。大腿部之伤未经任何治疗。
    回国后检查伤员右足趾及蹠骨头以下缺损是由于冻伤后切除坏死组织，足呈马蹄内翻畸形。背屈及外翻运动功能完全消失。大腿上三分之一部内侧有瘘管。在X线照片上见有大块弹片存留在大腿内，大约在股骨小粗隆下八公分处，和瘘管位置相近（见图34A．B．C）。
    按此伤员之主要残废是直接由于手术割断腓总神经所造成。每隔二至三星期即手术一次并且连续十一次之多，说明所作之手术是不适当的，技术也是恶劣的。另一方面，对存留在大腿内的大块弹片，美方军医在二年余之时间内竟置之不理以致瘘管经久不愈。
    第二十三例  病历号1314  王现庭（曾用名王胜熊）拘留号707633。
    一九五一年五月二十七日被俘，俘时无伤。一九五二年十月一日在战俘营中纪念中华人民共和国国庆时被美军枪伤——多处软组织伤。负伤后一天半始作扩创。四天后二期缝合。部分伤口七天后拆线一期愈合，部分伤口化脓。右小腿伤较深且广泛，延至三个多月后始愈。在治疗过程中右小腿从未加以任何固定，更无功能运动方法之帮助。
    现在检查见右足呈固定之马蹄内翻畸形，系由于跟腱高度挛缩所造成。腓长肌腓短肌及胫前肌高度伸展，然无麻痹现象（见图35）
    按此伤员足下垂之畸形是因为跟腱挛缩所致。如果美方军医在治疗过程中能应用一些简单步骤，如适当的固定，则这样的畸形残废就完全可以避免。
    第二十四例  病历号1413  康明权拘留号780387。
      一九五一年十月二日为炮弹击起的碎石子磞伤左眼。当时自以急救包包起。两小时后被俘。当晚被审询军情至深夜，并遭到棒击。次日又被送到美军师部审问军情，然后押运南行，经四日到汉城。在此数日内未得到饮食。伤眼亦未得到处理。在汉城共住半月余，只更换绷带两次。然后转送到釜山始作初次检查。检查时发现视力减退，已不能辨别物体。两个月后炎症消退并已能鉴别一尺外之手指数。一九五二年六月被转送到济州岛。在该岛受到四次毒气之迫害。一个月后左眼完全失明。此后即经常有刺激症状。
    回国后检查，右眼正常，左眼眼球萎缩，有粘连性角膜白斑及环角膜性充血（见图36）。
    按此例在受伤被俘后先后被数度审询军情且遭拷打逼问。在团部及师部都有治疗之条件却未加以最简单之处理，以致该眼伤情竟以延误治疗而终至失明。尤有甚者，该眼既已完全失明且反复表现刺激症状之后，又不按照眼科治疗原则早日摘除眼球，以防交感性眼炎之发生，保障健眼之安全。
    第二十五例  病历号1442  胡天生拘留号71422。
   一九五一年十月七日下午被炮弹炸伤。昏迷数小时。苏醒后始知业已被俘并觉右眼剧疼，视力尽失。当日被带到团部及师部审询军情。十月十二日转送到釜山。此数日内伤眼极疼却未得到处理。在釜山时每周换绷带二次并注射青霉素。一个月后该眼炎症消退但上睑与眼窝形成粘连。睑裂部分之结膜暴露因而每遇风尘刺激即有流泪磨疼。
    回国后检查时，右眼窝凹陷，上睑内面与高度萎缩之眼球全部粘连。睑裂部分之结膜暴露并强度充血（见图37）。
    按此例被俘时伤情严重应作急症处理而美军医务人员竟反复审询军情一再耽搁伤眼，以致伤后数日，伤员仍处于极其痛苦状态之中。到釜山后，也未作有效的睑球粘连之预防以致形成丑恶之畸形。结膜终年暴露，经常引起流泪磨疼，成为伤员终身精神上和身体上的痛苦。
    小结：
    在前数章内我们揭露了美方军医在骨与关节战伤、冻伤和截肢问题中违反医学原则的不合理的治疗情况。本章又举出了一些事实以说明美方军医在治疗其他战伤时同样的错误百出。
    本章所举病历说明美方军医可以任凭伤眼发展为睑球粘连而不加以预防；对已失掉功能并有刺激症状之眼球也不及时摘除以防止使健侧眼发展为交感性眼炎之危险；手术中粗暴的切断重要神经造成畸形和瘫痪；作胸廓成形术时不考虑适应症因而造成呼吸困难，而在恶果产生后经一年之久也始终未加处理；对防止跟腱挛缩畸形即使最简单的步骤如夹板固定也不做。
    总之美方军医在治疗我方被俘人员时，非但极少减轻伤员痛苦，并且还制造了许多残废。
    第六章  营养情况
    归来人员的营养不良是普遍的。因为伤病员的疾病可能影响其营养情况，所以我们以1045名非伤病归来人员，做为我们的营养调查对象。这批人员是停战协定签字后被遣返人员中的一部分，是完全没有经过任何选择的。调查结果，发现普遍的营养不良现象如下：
    1、外表消瘦，体重较轻；
    2、贫血；
    3、维生素甲缺乏；
    4、核黄素缺乏；
    5、毛细血管脆性增加。
    现在把这些现象分别叙述于后：
    一、一般情况
    这一批归来人员的一般情况是不健康的，他们都是显然地瘦弱，面色灰暗，皮肤干燥，精神不振，看起来比其实际年龄苍老。几乎每个人都感觉全身无力，容易疲倦；稍一活动，如跑步、上台阶，就感觉气短。归来之后，每夜睡眠八、九小时还感不够；食欲有了增进，但食量远不及被俘前的标准。许多人的食量只达到被俘前的一半。
    二、体重
    这批人员的体重在刚归来时量了一次；在二十六天后又量了一次。在这短短的期间内，除了少数人有营养不良性水肿因吃得好了水肿消失而体重减少外，绝大多数（80％以上）有了明显的体重增加。其情况如下表：
    表五：  体重增加表
    ※此199人中包括：体重未增加者76人，因营养不良性水肿消失而体重减少者123人。
    ※※检查总人数为1045人，因其中有5人无对照体重，故未列入。
    (附图表）
    上表所载的增加体重只能代表归来人员在被俘期中所失掉的体重的一部分。因为：第一、恢复的期间还不够长，多数人的体重还在继续增加中；第二、营养缺乏每伴有组织水分增加，甚至有显著的水肿，因而在恢复期间，由于水分消失，体重反而可能一度减轻。虽然如此，这批归来人员在26天中已有841人的体重增加，其平均增加体重为2．8公斤，且其中125人增加5公斤以上。这是我方被俘人员在拘留期间失掉大量体重的强有力的佐证。
    三、血色素
    在这批非伤病员中，毫无选择的测定了785人的血色素。从表六，我们可以看出绝大多数归来人员的血色素浓度是低于正常的。80％以上的人的血色素在每100C．C．血液中低于12克，60％以上低于11克，40％以上低于10克；平均血色素只10．3克。这些非伤病员都是被美方认为“健康者”，在停战协定签字以后才遣返的。他们最近没有失过血，没有做过甚么外科手术，也没有可能引起贫血的疾病。这样普遍的贫血是不能用任何个别原因来解释的。在这批归来人员中必然有其共同的因素，而这个共同的因素一定就是最能招致贫血的长期的营养缺乏。
    表六：  血色素统计表
    四、维生素缺乏
    他们的维生素缺乏，主要的是甲种维生素缺乏和核黄素缺乏。我们诊断甲种维生素缺乏，系根据夜盲、皮肤毛囊角化，比脱氏斑、干眼症等表征之一。我们诊断核黄素缺乏，系根据口角炎、口腔炎、舌变化、阴囊湿疹等表征之一。实际上，多种表征常同时存在，只根据一种表征来诊断维生素甲缺乏或核黄素缺乏的例子居极少数。
    我们还做了毛细血管脆性试验。（毛细血管脆性试验，我们是照Wintrobe氏方法，在5厘米直径圆区以内，有21个以上出血点，才算是阳性。）
    以上各项检查的结果，统计如下表：
    表七：维生素缺乏症统计表
    注：（一）检查总人数1045人。
    （二）毛细血管脆性试验系407人中72人阳性。
    （三）并有维生素甲缺乏和核黄素缺乏病者809人，只有维生素甲缺乏或核黄素缺乏之一种者214人，共1023人，为检查总人数之97．9％。
    根据检查结果如表七所示，非伤病归来人员的营养缺乏情形是十分严重的。半数以上有夜盲，63．1％有皮肤毛囊角化。有维生素甲缺乏症的总人数几达90％。相似的，核黄素缺乏症也普遍地存在着，总数达79．7％；若把在被俘期中曾有过的表征都统计在内，则可高到88％。有18％的人呈毛细血管脆性增加，所以潜伏性维生素丙缺乏也是存在的。
    通常维生素缺乏症的出现与总热量摄入有关。同等程度的维生素缺乏，在充足的热量摄入情况下可能表现得很明显，但在长期饥饿状态下反倒隐而不显。我方被俘人员在被俘期中的热量摄入是长期不够的（详后）。因此，以上所发现的各种维生素缺乏症的频率只能代表美方战俘营营养缺乏的普遍性和严重性的一部分。
    综观以上各项营养调查结果，归来人员的营养情况都是很恶劣的。我们知道，营养不足和营养不良是诱致各种急性和慢性疾病的重要因素。例如：蛋白质缺乏和维生素丙缺乏可以影响创伤的愈合；维生素甲缺乏可以引起呼吸道上皮细胞变化，因而容易招致呼吸道感染。因此，从营养情况方面也可以说明为什么归来人员中有这么多的人患着严重的疾病。
    五、营养缺乏的原因
    上述各项材料毫无疑问地证明了归来人员的营养情况是普遍恶劣的，各种营养缺乏病的发病率是惊人的高。
    营养缺乏病通常有下列几种原因：
    1、体内外各种因素影响食物的消化和吸收；
    2、体内外各种因素使身体对营养素的需要量增加；
    3、食物中所含的营养素质和量方面不足；
    4、上列各种因素的结合。
    稍一了解归来人员在美方战俘营中的生活，便容易明白何以他们的营养情况是这样的恶劣。一、美军经常使用各种屠杀、虐待及其他非人道暴行，造成恐怖和威胁，使被俘人员的体内代谢率增高，并严重影响食物的消化和吸收。至于断食断水则更直接的危害营养情况。二、被俘人员在战俘营中经常被强迫服劳役，每日劳动时间很长，消耗大量的体力，当然增加身体对营养素的需要量。三、直接影响营养情况的是食物的质和量。根据我们已知道的材料，美方战俘营中的食物质很不好，量也不够。
    每位归来人员一致反映，在美方战俘营中从来没吃过一顿饱饭。在归来人员中，有些人曾在美方各战俘营中做过炊事员工作。根据这些熟悉情况的人的报告，估计了每人每日的平均食物量。这样的估计，虽然可能比被俘人员实际获得的食物量要高些，但已经足够说明被俘人员是长期在半饥饿状态中生活着。每日所得的总热量是不够的，脂肪和动物蛋白亦非常缺乏。各种维生素都不足，尤其特别缺少维生素甲（估计只达正常需要量的十分之一），其次是缺乏核黄素，维生素丙也不足。这种非常缺乏营养素的食物情况，与我们在归来人员中所发现的营养恶劣状况和营养缺乏症的高度发病率正是完全符合的。
    我方被俘人员在美方战俘营中长期处于半饥饿状态之中，形成普遍的营养缺乏病。美方违反了日内瓦公约第二十六条：“每日基本口粮在量，质，与种类上应足够保持战俘健康及防止体重之减轻或营养不足……”的规定，是无可抵赖的。
    第七章  结核病问题
    在五百六十七例先后归来的内科病员中患结核病者共有230人，这些病例都经过了详细的病历询问、体格检查、化验检查（包括痰液和红血球沉降率），及胸部X线照片检查。他们所患的结核病类型及活动程度，根据现在检查的结果可以由下表说明之：
    表八  结核病之分类
    ※肺结核病变的活动程度是根据下列标准划分的：
    （一）静止：1、X线照片显示病变大部纤维化或钙化；2、痰中未发现结核菌；3、红血球沉降率正常；4、临床无中毒症状。
    （二）一般活动：1、X线照片显示少量浸润性病变，尚未明确纤维化。2、痰内发现或未发现结核菌。3、红血球沉降率正常或稍增进（第一小时末在30毫米以下）。4、临床或有或无中毒症状。
    （三）严重活动：1、X线照片显示较多的浸润性，干酪性，或渗出性病变，或有或无空洞形成。2、同时至少有下列条件之一：甲、痰中发现结核菌；乙、红血球沉降率第一小时未超过30毫米；丙、临床有中毒症状。
    这230名患结核病的归来病员经过我们调查，发现这些患者症状的发生与增重是和他们在被俘后，在病前及在病中所处的恶劣环境（包括无结核病者与结核病患者杂处），和他们所遭受的残暴待遇是分不开的。美方对我方被俘人员任意施以非人道的待遇和暴行是极普遍的现象，患病者亦无例外。在230名结核病患者中，就有186名在病前或病中受过暴行；其中肺结核有142例。更惊人的是遭受非人道待遇的结果，竟使46例的肺结核病变发展成为严重活动性。兹将以上情况述之于下：
    一、症状的发生
    有如众所周知，在第二次世界大战期间德日法西斯的战俘营曾经是结核病的温床，营养缺乏和恶劣的生活条件促成了结核病的发生与散布。这些恶劣条件在美军战俘营中已完全具备。因此在归来伤病员中患结核病者占着很大的数目。这230例结核病患者大部分在被俘前毫无症状，是被俘以后经过相当时日才发生症状的。少数人在被俘前偶有轻咳，但在被俘后经过一段时间症状便显著的增重了。很显然，在这些患者中结核病临床病象的发生与增重，其直接的原因就是他们在战俘营中所受的非人道待遇和各种暴行，如：殴打、酷刑、毒气、过度劳役、断食断水、冷冻等。结核病患者在症状发生或增重之前受过暴行的例证很多，兹举其四说明如下：
    第二十六例  丰年（丰日成）  病历号933男性，二十一岁，一九五一年五月二十八日被俘。
    俘前从无呼吸系症状。被俘后屡次遭受恶劣的待遇：曾被强迫刺字，被罚在尖石子上模仿兽走并遭毒打。至一九五二年九月连受毒气三次之后开始咳嗽，咯有臭味的黄痰，痰中带血，并有胸痛。夜间出盗汗，消瘦，全身无力。病后又继续遭受毒气五次（参见表九），更加重其病状。一九五二年十二月经过X线照片检查，谓有肺病，即转往釜山。
    归来后检查，仍有咳嗽，咯黄痰带血，有胸痛，发热至38℃左右。痰中有结核菌。X线胸片显示右肺上部及左肺上中部有多量浸润性病变及大小不等的空洞。（见图38）
    本例说明被俘一年四个月后，遭到各种恶劣待遇及暴行，于受毒气后发生肺结核症状。
    第二十七例  邵樟根  症历号820  拘留号713885  男性，三十岁，一九五一年五月二十七日被俘。
    俘前无任何呼吸系病症状。被俘后经常受饥受寒。一九五一年十月在巨济岛72联队服劳役时，胸部曾遭毒打，当晚即咯血、咳嗽、咯痰。两日后被送至釜山第六“休养所”，症状逐渐加剧。一九五二年一月咳嗽加剧，咯绿色有臭味痰，并感胸痛发烧。一九五二年四月又咯血。在“休养所”中仍不断遭受暴行。（见表九）
    归来后仍咳嗽咯痰，发烧（38度左右），有胸痛。X线检查发现两肺有片状浸润，上中部尤甚，病变中有多数小空洞。左侧胸膜及纵隔障胸膜肥厚。（见图39）红血球沉降率在第一小时末60毫米。痰中发现结核菌。
    本例说明俘前无症状，在俘中受虐待遭毒打后咯血，并发生其他肺结核症状。
    第二十八例  王学信（王孝行）病历号842拘留号716989男性，二十九岁，一九五一年五月被俘。一九五一年六月以前无任何呼吸系症状，一九五一年六月被审问是否党员干部，遭木棒毒打，当即昏迷。此后全身肿痛，约二十日后肿渐消。开始咳嗽，心慌，喘气困难，吐黄白色痰，痰中有血丝。一九五一年八月十二日及一九五二年十二月均曾咯血。并有胸痛、发烧、夜间盗汗、食欲不振、消瘦、疲乏无力等症状。一九五一年八月经X线检查后谓有肺病。被送至釜山，病中仍屡次遭受暴行。（见表9）
    归来后仍咳嗽、咯大量痰、发烧、有夜间盗汗、食欲不佳等症状。X线胸片显示两肺普遍分布浸润性病变，其中有多数小空洞。（见图40）红血球沉降率在第一小时末为58毫米，痰中有结核菌。
    本例说明在美方战俘营中遭毒打后约二十日发现了肺结核症状。
    第二十九例  陈启厚  病历号935拘留号707432男性，二十五岁，一九五一年五月二十六日被俘。
    一九五一年九月以前无任何呼吸系症状。被俘后经常服劳役并受毒打、脚踢，甚至昏迷倒地。曾被罚爬行。一九五一年九月在巨济岛第86联队因做劳工时被美军用木棒乱打全身，当时吐血，并开始有剧烈咳嗽咯大量痰。以后症状持续，咯大量有臭味的黄痰，有胸痛、发烧。每隔两三个月咯血一次，每次连续十余日。一九五一年十一月照X线胸片后，被送至釜山。病中仍受过断食断水的虐待。（见表9）
    归国后，仍咳嗽，咯多量黄痰，痰中带血。有胸痛、发烧。X线胸片显示两肺上、中部有大块片块浸润，右肺病变中有多数空洞。（见图41）红血球沉降率在第一小时末为34毫米，痰中有结核菌。本例说明肺结核症状发生于受毒打之后。
    二、病中遭受暴行
    167例肺结核患者中有46例表现着严重活动性病变（见表八）。分析一下这46例严重活动性肺结核患者在战俘营中的遭遇就可以明显地看出他们的病情为什么会发展到如此严重的程度。
    适当的休养和较好的营养是治疗肺结核的两个最基本的原则，这是世所公认的。但是美方是怎样对待这些肺结核患者呢？美方给这些患者的饮食较之一般被俘人员并无两样，而这种饮食是十分恶劣的（见第六章）。这种食物对一般人尚且难以维持健康，对结核病患者岂能不促使疾病的发展和恶化。美方对这些患者不但不给以适当的休养，相反地，他们对这些无力抵抗的，经不起摧残的病人，竟然施以残酷的暴行。在已被美方军医发现有肺结核，并因为有肺结核而住“医院”或住“休养所”之后，仍然遭受暴行，这是令人不能容忍的非人道的残暴行为。兹举出30例严重活动性肺结核患者在病中所受的种种暴行，列表说明如下：
    表九：三○名严重活动性肺结核患者病中遭受暴行表
    总结以上所述，我们可以肯定的说美方战俘营中的极端恶劣的环境条件和非人道的残酷暴行，促成了前述病员结核病的发生与发展。假使美方能够按照日内瓦公约来对待我方被俘人员，他们的健康状况就不会这样的坏。前述的事实足够证明美方战俘营当局确是违反了日内瓦公约，虐待我方被俘人员，既使他们有严重的病症，也同样遭受着残酷的待遇。
    第八章  非结核性慢性呼吸系疾患问题
    本章所谓非结核性慢性呼吸系疾患是指有以下条件的病例：
    1、三个月以上的呼吸系症状；
    2、经X线检查证实无肺的结核性实质病变；
    3、有关的异常胸部证征；
    4、异常的X线征，如肺气肿、肺纹理增厚、枝气管扩张等。
    凡患咳嗽、咯痰、咯血者都有过痰的肺吸虫卵检查，结果为阳性者未包括在本组病例之内。
    292名非结核性呼吸系病患者都至少具有上述1和2两条件，许多还兼有3或4。他们在1609名归来伤病员中占相当大的百分比（18．1％），占内科病员五六七名的半数以上。这样异常广泛的发生慢性呼吸系病一定是有其原因的。
    一、诱因
    呼吸系疾患的原因很多，其中尤以患者的内外环境为最重要。这些病员都是在被俘以后发生症状的，他们之中多数从来没有过较长期的呼吸系症状，有些虽然曾有冬季咳嗽的历史，但在被俘前是没有症状的。无论他们的症状为新得或复发，起病的诱因是和美军战俘营的恶劣生活条件、非人道待遇、残酷暴行、精神上的压迫和其他一切恶劣环境分不开的。单就暴行一项来讲，各种各样的迫害，包括被打、受冻、强迫劳役、禁闭、水牢、毒气、灌辣椒水等，就构成了约46％的病例的致病诱因。在患了呼吸系症状以后，这些病人还继续遭受毒气和各种虐待，有的甚至受毒气达10—20次之多，他们还必须继续服劳役，仍然吃着质和量都不够最低需要的食物。在这种极端不利于身体和精神健康的环境下，慢性呼吸系疾患这样惊人的多是不难理解的。下列数病例足以说明这些事实。
    第三十例施世洪病历号879拘留号780101男性  二十四岁  一九五○年十二月八日被俘。
    被俘以前无呼吸系症状，一九五二年四月被四个美军一齐毒打。毒打后发生剧烈咳嗽，咯多量白色痰，吐血，感胸痛和全身无力。美方军医听诊后说有肺结核，同年六月送济州岛第八号战俘营“B”号营场和肺结核病人住在一起，但没有给任何治疗。归国后，仍有咳嗽和胸痛，咯多量痰，痰中带血丝，有臭味。检查肺部无显明异常。痰中未发现结核杆菌，X线胸片显示两肺无实质病变，未发现肺结核，见肺纹理增厚，与慢性呼吸系疾患相符。
  （见图42）
    本例说明病员被打后开始有呼吸系症状，以后转成慢性。
    第三十一例邓兴财  病历号1018  拘留号713881  男性  二十四岁  一九五一年五月二十六日被俘。
    被俘前无任何呼吸系症状。一九五一年十月天气很冷，被剥去衣服，裸露上身关在铁丝网中至五天半之久。受冻后即开始咳嗽，咯黑色痰。痰中带血数月；并有胸痛、夜间盗汗、消瘦、全身无力等症状。美方军医听诊检查后谓有肺结核，并送到济州岛第八号战俘营“B”号营场与肺结核病人集中在一起，但未给适当治疗。归国后，仍有咳嗽、胸痛、咯黑色痰、痰中带血。肺检查无异常体征，痰中未见结核杆菌。X线胸片未见肺结核，无实质病变。肺纹理增厚。两肺下部尤甚，与慢性呼吸系疾患相符。
    本例说明呼吸系症状在冻后发生，现已成慢性。
    第三十二例  张畏福  病历号804  拘留号781828  男性  三十岁  一九五一年一月七日被俘。
    自一九四五年起在冬季咳嗽，到夏季即愈。被俘后冬夏均咳，但仍服劳役，并屡次被棒打或断绝饮食。一九五二年七月三日在济州岛第八号战俘营“I”号营场受毒气后咳嗽更加厉害，咯黑黄色痰，每日五十余口，痰中带血。感两侧胸痛，食欲不振，体重减轻，疲倦无力。照X线胸像后未告知有何疾病，即被集中在肺结核病人一起。归国后，咳嗽减轻，每日咯出痰十余口，检查两肺呈高清音，两背下方有干性囉音及哮喘音；痰中未发现结核杆菌。X线胸像表示肺纹理普遍增厚，未见实质病变
  （图44）
    本例说明受虐待和毒气后呼吸系症状增重。
    第三十三例  孙克义  病历号787  拘留号718251  男性  三十岁  一九五一年八月二十四日被俘。
    自一九四六年偶有轻度咳嗽，但被俘时无症状。一九五一年九月十八日受美军审问遭木棒殴打。又被绑在行军床上，往口内及鼻孔内灌辣椒水。灌了一壶后即行昏去。第二天早晨病员开始吐血，共吐七次，以后痰中经常带血。同时咳嗽加重，咯大量黄痰，并有两侧胸痛、发烧、消瘦等症状。同年十一月美方军医予照X线胸像，谓病员有“肺病”，先送到釜山“四休养所”与结核病人共住，后转到济州岛第八号战俘营“B”号营场。
    归国后，咳嗽仍重，痰仍多，有臭味，偶带血丝，胸痛仍存在。检查右肺下部有干性及湿性囉音。X线胸片表示两肺无实质病变，有显著普遍的肺纹理增厚。（见图45）
    本例说明遭受暴行后呼吸系症状发生，二年后仍持续不愈。
    第三十四例  苏俊有  病历号893  拘留号732659  男性  二十六岁  一九五一年十月十五日被俘。
    俘前身体健康，一九五二年二月在巨济岛八十六联队时，被审问是否党团员，遭受残酷暴行。被用二尺长木棒猛烈毒打胸部及腹部，当时即昏迷。回帐篷后即感两侧胸部疼痛，食后腹痛，并伴有咳嗽，以后咳嗽转为持续性，而且逐渐加重。有发热、发冷、盗汗等情形。同年三月吐血二天。美方军医为之照X线胸像，谓有肺结核，并抽胸水二次，每次抽出血水一茶杯。
    归国后，仍有咳嗽，但较轻。仍有胸痛，食欲较好，体重增加。检查心肺正常，痰中无结核杆菌。X线胸片显示两肺无实质病变，右膈成天幕状变形，说明有胸膜粘连。（见图46）
    本例说明病员在被打伤胸部后发生血胸，现有胸膜粘连。
    表十、非结核性慢性呼吸系患者症状统计表
    注：①总人数共292人，表内百分比系对总人数的百分比；
    ②此项中大量咯血者为23．3％；
    ③现在有症状的总人数共262人占89％。
    (附图表）
    二、现诊断
    根据病员在俘中的症状（参看表十）我们认为这些病例的最初诊断是急性呼吸系感染或暴行所致的呼吸系伤害。例如：受冻后可以发生肺炎或枝气管炎；毒气可以引起枝气管炎、肺水肿、并可继发枝气管肺炎和肺脓肿；胸部受外伤可以发生气胸、血胸或肺炎等。如所周知，急性呼吸系病症状若处理得当，一般是不会严重的。但在身体抵抗力低落，环境条件恶劣的时候，病变和症状可以持续或加重而成为慢性。
    慢性呼吸系疾患的成因是：1．在临床方面，在急性期延误治疗或治疗不得当，尤其是感染未加控制，以致炎症不能及时消散；
    2．在病理方面，枝气管粘膜水肿久不消退，以致渗出物潴留，肉芽组织和瘢痕组织形成，枝气管管壁受损害，肺实质受侵，进而发展为枝气管扩张、肺硕变、肺气肿等不能修复的病变。美方战俘营极端恶劣的环境和毫不负责的医疗处理，就促成了这一系列变化的增恶。更严重的是病员们不仅没有得到合理的休养和治疗，反而不断遭受迫害。他们在回到祖国之后，经过积极治疗，虽然显示了症状减轻，但89．7％还遗留了不同程度的症状。（参看表十）许多人还咯血或咯大量的痰，几乎半数还有胸痛。这些症状足够充分的指明他们的呼吸系病早已成为慢性，其中许多并已造成了枝气管扩张，甚至成了肺脓肿。以下二例足以说明：
    第三十五例  张德海  病历号849  拘留号718734  男性  二十三岁  一九五一年十月十一日被俘。
    四年前咳嗽过。被俘后即患咳嗽，日渐加剧，有气喘，咯多量绿色臭痰，感胸上部疼痛，有时发烧。美方军医照X线胸像后告为肺结核，并使住在肺结核病人一起。病员在病中仍继续遭受虐待和暴行，如服劳役，被脚踢、棒打、断食断水等。
    归来后，仍有气喘、咳嗽。痰量已较少，但仍有臭味。有时微发热。检查肺左侧背部下方呈枝气管呼吸音及哮鸣音。经检查未见结核菌。X线胸像显示两肺纹理普遍增厚，纹理局×有点状浸润，并表现蜂窝状阴影。以上各种变化在两肺下部尤为显著，符合枝气管扩张症。（见图47）
    本例说明慢性呼吸系疾患在拘留中发展为枝气管扩张。
    第三十六例  高子义  病历号398  拘留号709117  男性  二十八岁  一九五一年六月二十八日被俘。
    一九五一年初曾有咳嗽，被俘时已愈。一九五二年十一月即被俘后一年零五个月，又患咳嗽，不能起床，咯多量绿色臭痰。并有右胸痛和下午发烧病。病中曾受毒气，受毒气后约一个月后开始吐血。美方军医未给予任何治疗。
    归来后，仍咳嗽，咯大量痰，下午发烧。检查右肺中部呈浊音，呼吸音弱，无囉音。痰中未见结核杆菌。X线胸片表示右肺下叶有大片状致密阴影，其中有一空洞，约2×4厘米。右侧有肺膜肥厚和粘连。左肺清朗。（见图43）
    本例说明病员所患呼吸系疾患，因缺乏治疗又遭受毒气，已发展成为慢性肺脓肿。
    关于这些病例的客观所见，如许多病员（28．1％）有胸部体征，叩诊异常、呼吸音改变、干、湿性囉音等；胸部X线摄影除证明无结核性病变外，有些呈胸气肿或枝气管扩张，有些显肺影像纹理增厚。这些都说明他们具备着慢性呼吸系疾患的指征。
    三、战俘营当局的医疗处理
    美方战俘营对于这些呼吸系疾患的处理是极端违反医疗原则的。约三分之一以上的病员始终没有得到任何治疗，其他很少接受过化学疗法或抗生素疗法。许多人还继续被强迫劳役，还继续受毒气和其他迫害。几乎三分之二的患者在未经详细检查之前就被认为患肺结核而送到肺结核患者住在一起，本组病员中有64．3％受过这样的“隔离”。更荒谬的，无病的被俘人员，有时也被强迫送入肺结核病“休养所”。反之，有些结核患者，美方军医却置之不理，任之继续与健康者同住一起。在所谓“休养所”中，轻重病人杂居，结核患者和非结核患者不分，根本谈不到隔离，更缺乏应有的设备和消毒。美方军医集中这些呼吸系病患者。只图省事，却毫不顾及病员们彼此传染病菌的危险。在这种情况下，不仅结核病容易散播，其他细菌性或病毒性感染也很容易蔓延。这样，病员招致了继发感染，加重了病状，延长了病程，他们所受的损害是无法估量的。以下二例说明美军战俘营的胡乱“隔离”病人：
    第三十七例  全韩吉  病历号887  拘留号717283  男性  三十三岁  一九五一年六月十七日被俘。
    被俘前从无呼吸系症状。一九五一年八月开始咳嗽，咯多量白色痰，痰中有时带血丝，感左胸痛，曾有短期发烧。美方军医听诊后谓有“三期肺病”，当即送入釜山第五“休养所”隔离。在病中先后于一九五一年十一月及一九五二年二月被棒打，每次被打后症状更重。归来后，仍咳嗽，咯白痰，夜间有盗汗。检查左肺呼吸音稍低。痰中无结核杆菌。X线胸片表明肺无实质病变，而有肺气肿现象。（见图49）
    本例说明美方军医不予详细检查即将非结核性患者当成结核病人“隔离”。
    第三十八例  李小洪  病历号832  男性二十二岁  一九五一年十二月二十六日负伤被俘。
    在俘前与俘后均无呼吸系症状。一九五一年十二月被美军非法审问，被绑在棹上，用皮鞭毒打。一九五二年七月在釜山被强迫“甄别”时，被美军手榴弹伤及右上臂的上三分之一，且断食断水七天，这时还没有咳嗽。同月美方军医听诊检查谓有肺结核。即行“隔离”于济州岛第八号战俘营“B”号营场内，与肺结核病人住在一起。未接受任何治疗，但仍多次遭受暴行，如被打、脚踢、受毒气等。归来前已经有了咳嗽及咯痰，并有午后发烧，食欲不好，体重减轻等症状。检查右肺上方呼吸音减弱。痰中无结核杆菌。X线胸片显示，右肺上部纹理增厚，肺无显明实质病变。（见图50）
    本例说明：无病的被俘人员被美方军医随便“隔离”，反而发生了咳嗽等症状。
    总结二九二名非结核性慢性呼吸系病患者的情况，我们可以说他们大多数已经因病残废。美方战俘营给予他们的伤害，不减于断臂截肢，长远的痛苦可能更大，只是所使用的方法不同而已。这批病员的病情就是美国军事当局虐待我方被俘人员的证据。
    第九章  美军暴行的医学证据
    本报告中所调查的1609名归来人员中，几乎每人均在被俘期中遭受到一次或数次的暴行迫害，包括使用木棍、铁棍、刺刀、冲锋枪、轻机枪、重机枪、手榴弹、毒气弹、装甲车、坦克车等作战武器及火烧、冰冻、电刑、灌水、割肉等残暴杀害方法所致之伤害。本章是用医学方面的事实来证明美军的暴行是无可抵赖的。本章的内容分为两部分：
    一、暴行和疾病的关系
    在第一批归来的350名内科病员中，我们曾进行研究了病员所遭受的暴行和疾病发生或加重的关系。在研究过程中，我们发现有347人（99％）曾在被俘期间遭受到美军的暴行迫害。每人都遭受过不止一次的暴行；在每次暴行中，所受的酷刑又有多种。兹将他们遭受到的迫害分为病前及病中两期列表（表11）如下：
    表11、350名内科病员所受暴行统计表（每种暴行均不止一次）
    注：一、强迫劳役：抬重石头或木料，上兵舰杠大汽油筒等。
    二、禁闭：禁闭室无窗户，室内黑暗，空气不流通。
    三、“其他”项内包括水牢、火烧（火烧皮肤、火烧阴毛等）、灌水（凉水或辣椒水）、用竹签扎入指甲下、烙铁烫等。
        四、百分比系每百名病员中曾遭受暴行之人数。
    由上表可以看出在病中曾遭受到暴行的是很多的。这些暴行对于原有疾病所起的恶劣影响是很大的，已在内科疾病章中述及。
    在各种暴行中，毒气对疾病的影响最为严重。在350例内科病员中，313例（89．4％）曾受过毒气的直接危害。有些病员曾遭到多达二十次以上的毒气，一般的也都遭到三至十次之多。
    二、暴行所致的伤残
    1172名归来伤员经过详细的询问及检查后，发现有76名（6．5％）曾因遭受暴行迫害而遗有伤痕及残废，在这七十六例中，四十九例遗有大小不等的伤痕，二十七例则有各种程度的残废，应该特别提出的是在76名伤员中，有40名系在战俘营中遭受迫害，其余36名则系在医院中或往医院转送途中被美军所残害的。兹分别举例说明如下：
    一、虐待伤病战俘：美军对于身负重伤的战俘，甚至亦横加虐待，以致造成更多的伤残，可由下列三例说明：
    第三十九例  病历号103  刘铃（曾用名刘长元）拘留号不明。
    一九五一年十月二十七日，左上臂枪伤，肱骨骨折。当天被俘，被俘后美军非但未固定伤肢，反将双手腕部用电线反缚背后，强令伤员步行十余里后始由同时被俘的其他伤员松缚。当时伤员即发现左手肿胀、冰冷及麻木。此后该肢情况逐日恶化。至伤后二十余日。该肢肘部以下均已变黑。后曾施行两次截肢手术（图51）。
    第四十例  病历号1475  杨庆福  拘留号733236。
      一九五三年六月十六日，左胸部炸伤合并血胸，并有右肩部枪伤。伤后一小时被俘。美军强迫其步行，但伤员因伤重体力不支不能行走，美军将伤员背部着地拖行约二、三里路。以致头枕部、背部、右足跟和外裸部皮肉磨烂，现均遗有瘢痕（图52甲、乙）。
    第四十一例  病历号1024  谢成俭  拘留号175613。
    一九四九年体格检查时，视力正常。一九五一年四月在朝鲜中线被俘。先被拘在巨济岛，一九五二年六月转移到济州岛第八号战俘营。在俘中食粗糙大麦饭及萝卜汤，经常有腹部疼痛及腹泻，身体极弱。屡次请求美军军医检查及治疗，皆遭拒绝。一九五二年七月被强迫劳役，因行走不快，为监工美军以木棒击伤左眼，当时失去知觉约半小时许。醒后左眼极疼。经过两次请求。始给白色药膏一管，令自己擦。一个半月后，刺激症状消退，角膜上出现了白色翳，视力大减。回国后检查：左眼视力仅在一尺距离可数指。在角膜中心部位，有约五毫米大小之圆形粘连性白斑（图53）眼压增高。
    上述第三十九例说明因故意将受伤并有骨折的肢体反缚，以致骨折断端伤及附近血管，使肢体坏死，造成严重残废。第四十例说明美军对于重伤战俘，非但不护理转送，反而着地拖行二、三里之远，除增添新伤外，必然的会使原有伤病更形恶化。
    第四十一例中述及之伤员在俘中经常生病，身体极其衰弱。有病无人过问。在这种情况下还被迫从事劳役，又以暴力造成了左眼的损伤。
    在眼伤发生后，美军医务人员又无视伤病员之痛苦及严重的后果，不施以及时有效的治疗，以致造成左眼近于失明的结果。
    二、关于非法审讯：美军违反日内瓦公约的规定，对战俘普遍进行追索军事情报的审讯。在审讯过程中，经常对战俘以及伤病战俘施以种种刑罚，举例说明如下：
    第四十二例  病历号105  郝端和（曾用名柴守忠）拘留号不明。
    一九五一年十一月，左大腿及左小腿炸伤，左股骨下三分之一及左胫腓骨折。当天被俘，未给任何治疗，即行审讯。审讯时用粗木棍殴打左大腿伤口，边打边问，打二十余下后，伤员即昏迷。用凉水喷醒后，又重复毒打，以致再度昏迷。二日后左大腿伤口以下部分变黑，以后经过两次截肢手术（图54）。
    第四十三例  病历号787  孙克义  拘留号718251。
    一九五一年八月二十四日被俘。九月十八日非法审讯，用电线绑缚在行军床上，自鼻孔灌入辣椒水一壶，然后用木棒在腹部挤压，并将该员倒悬，倒出灌入之辣椒水。该员在审讯过程中，曾数度昏迷。次日起开始吐血，共吐血七次之多。现左上臂仍遗有电线绑缚之伤痕（图55）。
    上述第四十二例说明，由于美军非法审讯，对已有重伤的战俘施以酷刑，以致造成不应有的严重残废。第四十三例说明该伤员在遭受酷刑迫害后，虽幸免一死，但身罹重疾（吐血七次），伤痕至今犹存，可为暴行之铁证。
    三、关于强迫“甄别”：美军为了达到扣留我方被俘人员的目的，曾强迫在被俘人员臂上及身上刺反动字句。对于拒不刺字的被俘人员，则当着其他被俘人员面前施行酷刑及毒打至昏迷后刺字，甚至有在麻醉及手术后强行刺字者。例如郭六根（病历号596，拘留号733000）就是在一九五二年五月行双侧小腿截肢手术后抬回病房途中，右上臂被刺八个字。在76名曾因暴行迫害而被伤残之归来伤员中，12名系在强迫“甄别”时负伤者。如：
    第四十四例病历号1968  胡德忠  拘留号712968。
    在强迫“甄别”时双侧下肢均被炸伤，至今伤痕累累，清晰可见（图5）。
    第四十五例病历号122  徐成高（曾用名徐保宫及赵天高）  拘留号730767。
    该伤员在一九五一年三月初颈部及双手烧伤后被俘。一九五一年底被强迫在左上臂刺反动字句。一九五二年四月八日，当进行强迫“甄别”时，因该员仍坚持要回祖国，左上臂有字部分连皮带肉被割下示众，以威吓其他被俘人员（见图57）。
    四、关于一九五二年十月一日暴行：一九五二年十月一日上午七时，济州岛第八号战俘营第“H”号营场内被俘人员升起我国国旗纪念我国国庆，美军武装部队向在帐篷内和营场上的战俘开始猛烈射击，因而死伤甚众。在76名因暴行而遗有伤残的归来伤员中，17名系在该次暴行时负伤者，兹举二例，借资说明：
    第四十六例  病历号26  胡天银（曾用名李月良）拘留号731113。
    在该次暴行中左侧头部受卡宾枪弹伤，左顶骨及颞骨骨折。现在左顶骨及颞骨有大块缺损（图58甲及乙），伤员有运动性失语症，造成严重残废。
    第四十七例  病历号114  张国栋  拘留号708313。
    在该次暴行中左肩部受枪伤，左肱骨及左肩胛骨均有骨折。现在肩关节运动已完全丧失，造成严重残废（图59甲、乙及丙）。
    小结：
    美军对于手无寸铁的我方被俘人员所施的暴行，其残忍之程度，实属骇人听闻。伤员的伤痕和残废是他们所受暴行的铁一般的证据。
    第十章  结论
    综观前述1609名归来伤病员的检查结果，根据人道主义和医疗原则，我们重点地进行了分析研究，获得了如下结论。
    在治疗外科战伤方面最突出的表现，是有意识的牺牲被俘伤员的肢体、无理地截肢及高位截肢。对早期战伤不及时处理，不扩创。对骨折不加运输固定。在后方医院中，对骨折不设法使其复位、也不作正式固定。手术指征不合理，不注意预防畸形。对于其他战伤，例如眼部战伤，遇紧急情况不及时治疗以减轻患者痛苦，不设法预防后遗症。这种种罪恶行为当然要形成大量的残废。至于拖延治疗，不加护理等等，更是笔不胜书。这种所谓“治疗”不仅违反了战伤治疗原则，同时也违反了人道主义。
    567名内科病员中，有92％患慢性呼吸系病。而肺结核中有71％是活动性的；非结核性患者在归来后约90％还有着各种的呼吸系症状。这些数字是惊人的。这些病员症状的发生和增重，是和美方战俘营的生活条件、非人道待遇和残酷暴行有直接、间接关系的。例如，只就营养一项来讲，普遍的营养缺乏，尤其是蛋白质和各种维生素缺乏，就已足构成这些呼吸系病的诱因。许多病员在患病以后不能休养，没有得到及时诊断，没有得到及时合理治疗，还继续遭受着各种各样的虐待和迫害（包括毒气袭击），连住在“休养所”的也不能免。所有我方被俘人员。连伤病员在内，吃的都是质、量距最低标准很远的食物，以致营养缺乏病在被俘人员中普遍发生。
    战俘营中的所谓“休养所”只不过是随便把伤病者集中在一起，根本谈不到休养与治疗，更谈不到隔离。在这样的条件下，伤病被俘人员即或免于死亡，亦成为慢性病患者。
    今天我们看到的我方被俘人员的各种残废和慢性病是美方虐待和迫害我方战俘的铁证，是美方违反一九四九年日内瓦战俘待遇公约的具体说明，我们有责任从医学和人道主义的观点向全世界揭发和控诉。
