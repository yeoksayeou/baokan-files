    各地又有大批厂矿提前完成全年生产计划
    全国各地继续有一批国营、地方国营和公私合营厂矿提前完成全年生产计划。连以前报道过的计算，华北区到十一月中旬已有七十一个厂矿、沈阳市到十一月底已有四十八个厂矿、旅大市到十一月二十日有十六个厂矿、吉林省到十一月二十八日已有八个厂矿，辽西省到十一月初已有八个厂矿，提前完成了全年生产计划。东北区国营煤矿、电业、石油和有色金属工业系统，已先后于九、十月份超额完成今年全年的上缴利润计划。继续完成全年计划的厂矿有：鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂、第一薄板厂、铸管厂、养气厂、弓长岭铁矿、樱桃园矿山等九个单位，大连起重机器厂、大连机床厂、石油七厂、工矿车辆厂、油漆厂、电瓷厂、电工器材厂、化学制药厂、橡胶厂、机械制造厂、旅大罐头食品总厂、度量衡仪器厂、渔网工厂、阿城仪表厂，苏家屯砂轮厂、绥化制粉厂、哈尔滨水泥厂、北京建筑器材公司金属结构工厂、华北骨胶厂、利津化学染料厂、首都木材厂、北京仪器厂、度量衡厂、玻璃厂、石景山钢铁厂铸造部、粗苯、焦油、硫氨等车间，天津电讯器材厂、耐火器材厂、动力机器厂、第三机器厂、染料厂、振业石棉厂、华北管胶厂、津南制革厂，唐山钢厂、启新磁厂，大同发电厂，太原皮革厂、矿山机器厂，张家口面粉厂，绥远官村云母厂，兰州电厂，广州电业局、广州西村水泥厂，江西上饶茶厂，重庆五零一电厂、重庆綦江铁矿，旅大金县石棉矿、蛟河老头沟煤矿，京西城子煤矿，阳泉四矿，山西潞安煤矿、太原东山煤矿、郑家屯车站，武昌车辆厂客车车间黄宣友小组等。还有不少单位提前完成了今年基本建设任务。石家庄市建筑工程局第二工程处于十一月十八日，已全面超额完成了国家计划。蛟河矿务局基本建设工程公司到十一月二十七日止，已按期完成了各项基本建设计划。淮南钻探工程队于十月十五日提前两个半月完成了全年钻探任务。鹤岗矿务局地质钻探公司提前两个月超额完成十二亿元的节约任务。山西省运输公司提前四十九天全面完成全年国家计划。山东五○一厂四十九号钻探队从今年六月下旬开工，至十一月中提前一个半月完成了下半年的钻探任务。
