Dear Chairman Mao:

　　In the first year of the motherland’s First Five-Year Plan, under your leadership and the leadership of the Party, remarkable achievements have been made in all fields. The various crops on the 718 mu of land in our agricultural production cooperative have also achieved bumper harvests. A total of 282,148 jin of grain was harvested, with an average yield of approximately 400 jin per mu, an increase of 53 jin per mu compared to last year.

　　As production increased, the income of cooperative members also increased. Among the 59 households in the entire cooperative, more than ten households saw an increase of over 20% compared to last year, and over thirty households saw an increase of about 3%. Only a very small number of members experienced a slight decrease in income compared to last year due to individual reasons. As our income increased, our lives have also greatly improved. Many members have put on new padded jackets and trousers, and every family is eating golden corn pancakes and snow-white tofu. All forty-plus school-age children in the cooperative are attending school, and fifteen young men and women are studying at night school. The cooperative members generally realize that as long as we take a step forward on the road to agricultural collectivization, our lives will also improve accordingly. Now many members are saying: "When we worked individually, the threshing ground was empty; when we were in a mutual aid team, we had a little bran after threshing; after joining the cooperative, we have surplus grain in our granaries."

　　Dear Chairman Mao! Now all of our cooperative members, after repeatedly studying the Party and the state's general line and general task for the transition period as you pointed out, are very excited and say: "Socialism will not come by waiting, we must work hard with practical actions!" Therefore, the members unanimously requested at the meeting to sell more than 30,000 jin of surplus grain from the cooperative to the state. From the wheat season to now, we have contributed a total of 67,250 jin of coarse and fine grains to the national construction.

　　Now, in order to welcome 1954, all cooperative members are conducting rectification work, preparing to recruit new members, and formulating a comprehensive production plan for 1954. At the same time, they are enthusiastically engaged in winter sideline production, preparing sufficient fertilizer and farm tools to lay the foundation for a bumper harvest next year.

　　Dear Chairman Mao, now many peasant brothers and sisters outside the cooperative are asking to join. Our cooperative must expand. Under your leadership and the Party's leadership, and illuminated by the general line, we guarantee that we will run the cooperative well, produce more grain, and purchase national economic construction bonds to support national construction, and strive for a steady transition to a socialist society!

　　And wish you—our wise leader—eternal health!

    吕鸿宾农业生产合作社各种庄稼获得丰收亲爱的毛主席：
    祖国第一个五年计划的头一年，在您和党的领导下，各方面都取得了辉煌成就。我们农业生产合作社的七百一十八亩土地上的各种庄稼也都得到了丰收。共收二十八万二千一百四十八斤粮食，每亩平均约四百斤，比去年每亩增产五十三斤。
    随着产量的提高，社员的收入也增加了。全社五十九户中，比去年增加百分之二十以上者有十余户，增加百分之三左右的有三十多户，仅有极少数社员因个别原因比去年收入略有减低。我们随着收入的增加，生活也大大地改善了，很多社员都穿上了新袄新裤、每家吃上了焦黄的玉米煎饼、雪白的小豆腐。全社四十多名学龄儿童都上了学，十五名男女青年在夜校里学习。社员普遍认识到：只要往农业合作化的道上前进一步，生活也随着提高一步。现在很多社员说：“单干时场了粮光，在组时粮少打上点糠，入社后囤里有了余粮。”
    亲爱的毛主席！现在我们全体社员，多次学习了您指出的党和国家在过渡时期的总路线总任务后，十分兴奋地说：“社会主义不是等来的，咱们得用实际行动加劲干哪！”因此，社员们在大会上一致要求把社里的三万多斤余粮卖给国家。我们由麦季到现在共计把六万七千二百五十多斤粗细粮，投入国家建设中去了。
    现在全体社员为了迎接一九五四年，正一面进行整社，准备吸收新社员，制订一九五四年全面生产计划；一面热火朝天的投入冬季副业生产，预备了充足的肥料及农具为来年丰收打下了基础。
    亲爱的毛主席，现在有很多社外农民弟兄，纷纷要求入社。俺社一定要扩大，在您和党的领导和总路线的照耀下，我们保证把社办好，打更多的粮食，认购国家经济建设公债以支援国家建设，为稳步过渡到社会主义社会而奋斗！
    并祝您——我们的英明领袖永远健康！

    农业生产合作社社长  吕鸿宾
