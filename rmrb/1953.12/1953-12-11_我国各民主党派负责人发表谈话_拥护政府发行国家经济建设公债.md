Xinhua News Agency, December 10th: Leaders of China's various democratic parties have issued statements unanimously endorsing the Central People's Government's issuance of the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds. They also expressed their intention to actively respond to the state's call and encourage the masses they are connected with to enthusiastically subscribe to the bonds.

    Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said, "I believe the government's measure of issuing construction bonds is correct and timely. Under the illumination of the general line of the state's transition period, the people of the whole country are advancing towards the socialist industrialization of the country. The country's socialist industrialization is the highest interest of all the people in the country, and all the people in the country should contribute their greatest strength to this great national construction cause. Issuing bonds is one of the important and regular methods of raising funds for socialist industrialization, and it is also completely consistent with the common long-term interests of the people of the whole country. For this issuance of construction bonds, the Central People's Government has fully estimated the purchasing power of the people of the whole country, and its issuance figures are also rationally allocated according to the actual situation of the income and living expenses of people of all classes. I believe that the people of the whole country will show a high degree of patriotism and unanimously support this bond issuance. Our democratic party members should take the lead in responding to the state's call, and drive the masses they are connected with to enthusiastically subscribe, and widely publicize, so as to successfully complete and overfulfill the purchase task in the shortest possible time."

    Zhang Lan, Chairman of the China Democratic League, said, "I warmly endorse the government's upcoming issuance of the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds. The government's issuance of national economic construction bonds will not only accelerate the country's industrialization economically, but also demonstrate the high degree of patriotism of the people of the whole country politically. We firmly believe that it will surely receive the unanimous and enthusiastic support of the people of the whole country. In the past four years, people's lives have been generally improved, whether in cities or in rural areas, and it is entirely possible to take out part of their income and savings to buy bonds. The number of national economic construction bonds issued this time and the subscription methods have fully estimated the people's purchasing power, and the amount allocated is also very reasonable. It can be asserted that the issuance of these bonds can not only be successfully completed, but may even be overfulfilled."

    Huang Yanpei, Director of the Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, said, "It is absolutely necessary to issue economic construction bonds during the period when the country begins large-scale economic construction. Judging from the successful restoration and development of the national economy and the rising economic life of the people, the successful completion of the amount of bonds issued is also completely certain. This means that the issuance of economic construction bonds represents the fundamental and long-term interests of the broad masses of the people. The people of the whole country, after studying the general line of the state's transition period, have realized the great prospect of the country's socialist industrialization, and will surely enthusiastically subscribe to bonds to express their love for the great motherland and their loyal support for the country's general line. As far as private industry and commerce are concerned, the national market has been unprecedentedly prosperous this year, and the business of private enterprises has generally improved; private industrialists and businessmen have made certain progress in their understanding under the education of the Communist Party of China and the People's Government in recent years, and recently they have also studied the general line and received education on patriotism and law-abiding. Therefore, we believe that private industrialists and businessmen will be able to complete and even overfulfill the glorious task of purchasing bonds this time. To this end, the Federation calls on all members to play a leading and backbone role in the bond subscription work this time, and together with all industrialists and businessmen, strive to overfulfill and contribute their greatest strength to the country's economic construction."

    Ma Xulun, Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, said, "I firmly support this important measure taken by the government to accelerate national economic construction. I remember that in 1950, our country issued Victory Inflation-Proof Bonds, and at that time, the people of the whole country completed the subscription task with unparalleled enthusiasm in a very short time. This time, the issuance of construction bonds is very necessary for the country to carry out planned construction, gradually realize the country's socialist industrialization, and ensure that the people obtain a happier life. All members of our China Association for Promoting Democracy guarantee to do our best, together with the people of the whole country, to strive for the successful completion of the glorious task of issuing national economic construction bonds in 1954."

    Peng Zemin, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, said, "When our country enters a period of large-scale economic construction and gradually realizes socialist industrialization, the issuance of national economic construction bonds is timely, completely necessary, and also completely in line with the interests of the people of the whole country. Enthusiastically subscribing to national economic construction bonds is a concrete manifestation of our people's love for the motherland and socialist construction. We call on our party members not only to enthusiastically subscribe, but also to mobilize their relatives and the masses they are connected with to quickly and overfulfill the subscription amount, and widely do a good job of publicity."

    Spokesperson of the Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party said, "The issuance of bonds in our country at present has special significance. Because our country has entered a period of large-scale planned economic construction, and the issuance of bonds is an extremely necessary method to accumulate funds to accelerate the country's socialist industrialization. In recent years, people's lives have been generally improved, and people's political awareness has been greatly improved. They can recognize the vision and future of our country, and everyone will be willing to take out their savings to subscribe to bonds to help national construction and save for themselves. All comrades of our China Zhi Gong Party warmly support the government's correct measure of issuing construction bonds, and will enthusiastically subscribe, and at the same time will promote the masses we are connected with to subscribe in large quantities, to fulfill our patriotic responsibility."

    Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Jiusan Society, said, "The issuance of the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds is timely. Bonds are both people's savings and a manifestation of people's patriotism. Trickles of water flow into rivers, and small amounts of money, as long as they are gathered together, can have a positive effect on the country. Therefore, purchasing national economic construction bonds is a sincere expression of love for the motherland, a concrete patriotic action in the process of national industrialization, and a glorious obligation that each of us should fulfill to the country. Our cultural, educational, and scientific workers should enthusiastically purchase national economic construction bonds, quickly and overfulfill this great and glorious task, and ensure the victorious progress of the country's socialist industrialization."

    Spokesperson of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League Office in Beijing said, "National construction needs to raise funds from all aspects to have guarantees. The issuance of bonds is one of the important and regular methods of raising funds. 1954 is the second year of the first five-year construction plan. The victorious completion of this annual plan has a great relationship to future construction. Therefore, the issuance of national economic construction bonds is a completely necessary measure. Members of our Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League will actively publicize the significance of issuing the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds, and work together with the people of the whole country to strive for the victorious completion of this task of great significance."

    Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, said, "The Chinese youth, who have a glorious tradition of patriotism, yearn for the beautiful life of socialism and spare no effort to promote the accelerated progress of socialist construction. In this bond issuance, they will surely make valuable contributions. The issuance of national economic construction bonds is another most vivid and practical education for our youth and all the people. Chinese youth should become a propaganda team to mobilize the people of the whole country to subscribe to bonds, actively and patiently conduct propaganda work to their families, relatives, friends, and the surrounding masses, repeatedly explain the political and economic significance of issuing bonds, and its benefits to the country and the people. Our youth must also enthusiastically subscribe to bonds according to their strength. We believe that the youth of the whole country will, together with the people of the whole country, set off a patriotic upsurge of purchasing bonds and successfully complete this national bond issuance task."

    我国各民主党派负责人发表谈话
    拥护政府发行国家经济建设公债
   【新华社十日讯】我国各民主党派负责人发表谈话，一致拥护中央人民政府发行一九五四年国家经济建设公债，并表示将积极响应国家号召，带动所联系的群众踊跃认购。
    中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深说，我认为政府发行建设公债的措施，是正确的，适时的。全国人民在国家过渡时期总路线照耀之下，正在向国家的社会主义工业化前途迈进。国家社会主义工业化是我们全国人民的最高利益，全国人民都应为这一伟大的国家建设事业贡献其最大力量。发行公债是筹集社会主义工业化资金的重要的和经常的方法之一，也是与全国人民共同的长远的利益完全一致的。这次建设公债的发行，中央人民政府是充分估计到全国人民的购买能力的，其发行数字也是按照各阶层人民的收入和生活开支的实际情况合理分配的。我相信这次公债的发行，全国人民定会表现高度的爱国热情，一致拥护。我们民主党派成员应该首先响应国家号召，并带动所联系的群众踊跃认购，广泛宣传，务期于最短期间胜利完成和超额完成购买任务。
    中国民主同盟主席张澜说，我对于政府将发行的一九五四年国家经济建设公债表示热烈拥护。政府这次发行国家经济建设公债，不仅在经济上可以加速国家工业化的进行，而且在政治上也可以表现全国人民的高度的爱国主义精神。我们深信它一定会得到全国人民一致的热烈拥护。近四年来，不论在城市或农村，人民生活有了普遍的改善，拿出一部分收入和积余来购买公债是完全可能的。这次发行的国家经济建设公债的数目及认购的办法，是充分估计到人民的购买力量，数额分配也很合理。可以断言，这次公债的发行，不但可以胜利完成，而且可能超额完成。
    中国民主建国会总会常务委员会主任委员黄炎培说，在国家开始大规模经济建设时期发行经济建设公债是完全必要的，根据国家经济胜利恢复和发展以及人民经济生活上升的情况来看，发行公债数额的胜利完成，也是完全有把握的。这就是说，发行经济建设公债是代表了广大人民的根本利益和长远利益的。全国人民经过了国家过渡时期总路线的学习，认识了国家社会主义工业化的伟大前途，一定会踊跃地认购公债来表示自己对于伟大祖国的热爱，对于国家总路线的忠诚拥护。就私营工商界来说，今年全国的市场空前繁荣，私营企业的业务普遍好转；私营工商业者几年来在中国共产党和人民政府的教育下，认识上有了一定的进步，最近又学习了总路线，受到了爱国守法的教育，因此，我们相信，私营工商业者一定能够完成乃至超额完成这次购买公债的光荣任务。为此，本会号召全体会员在这次公债的认购工作中，发挥带头和骨干的作用，并和所有工商业者一起，争取超额完成，为国家经济建设贡献出自己最大的力量。
    中国民主促进会主席马叙伦说，我坚决拥护政府为加速国家经济建设所采取的这一重要措施。记得一九五○年我们国家发行过胜利折实公债，当时全国人民曾以无比的热情在极短的时间内超额完成了认购任务。这次发行建设公债对于国家进行有计划的建设，逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，保证人民获得更幸福的生活，都是十分必要的。我们中国民主促进会全体会员保证尽自己最大的力量，和全国人民一道，为胜利完成一九五四年国家发行经济建设公债这一光荣的任务而努力。
    中国农工民主党中央委员会副主席彭泽民说，当我们国家进入大规模经济建设，逐步实现社会主义工业化时期，发行国家经济建设公债，是及时的，完全必要的，同时也是与全国人民的利益完全符合的。踊跃认购国家经济建设公债，是我们全国人民热爱祖国、热爱社会主义建设的具体表现。我们号召我党成员不仅要踊跃认购，而且要动员自己的亲属和所联系的群众，迅速地超额地完成认购数额，并广泛做好宣传工作。
    中国致公党中央委员会发言人说，在我国目前发行公债，具有特殊的意义。因为我国已进入大规模计划经济建设的时期，而发行公债，是积累资金以加速国家社会主义工业化的一项极为必要的办法。几年来，人民生活普遍得到改善，人民的政治觉悟都已大大提高，能够认识到我们国家的远景和前途，人人都会愿意拿出自己的节余来认购公债，以帮助国家建设并为自己进行储蓄。我们中国致公党全体同志热烈拥护政府发行建设公债的正确措施，并将踊跃认购，同时将推动我们所联系的群众大量认购，以尽我们爱国的责任。
    九三学社主席许德珩说，发行一九五四年国家经济建设公债是适时的。公债一方面是人民的储蓄，一方面又是人民爱国的一种表现。涓涓之水，流为江河，小额的金钱只要聚集起来，就可以对国家发生积极作用。所以，购买国家经济建设公债，是热爱祖国的真诚表现，是在国家工业化进程中一种具体的爱国行动，也是我们每一个人对国家应尽的一项光荣义务。我们文教科学工作者，应当踊跃购买国家经济建设公债，迅速地超额地来完成这一伟大光荣任务，保证国家社会主义工业化的胜利进行。
    台湾民主自治同盟驻京办事处发言人说，国家建设需要从各方面筹集资金，才有保障。发行公债就是筹集资金的重要和经常的方法之一。一九五四年是第一个五年建设计划的第二年，这一年度计划的胜利完成对今后建设有极大关系，因此发行国家经济建设公债是完全必要的措施。我们台湾民主自治同盟的成员将积极宣传发行一九五四年国家经济建设公债的意义，和全国人民一道为胜利完成这个有重大意义的任务而奋斗。
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记处书记胡耀邦说，具有爱国主义光荣传统的中国青年，对于社会主义的美好生活倾心向往，毫不吝惜自己的力量，来推动社会主义建设事业加速前进。在这次公债发行中，他们一定会作出有价值的贡献。国家经济建设公债的发行，对我国青年和全体人民来说，又是一次最生动最实际的教育。中国青年要成为动员全国人民认购公债的一支宣传队伍，积极地耐心地向自己家庭、亲戚、朋友和周围的群众作宣传工作，反复地解释发行公债的政治意义和经济意义，及其对国家和对人民的好处。我们青年还要按照自己的力量，踊跃地认购公债。我们相信，全国青年一定会和全国人民一道，掀起一个爱国主义的购买公债的热潮，胜利完成这一次国家发行公债的任务。
