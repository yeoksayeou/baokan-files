Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, December 5th: The state-owned Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, in its production increase and economy drive labor emulation, has solved many key problems in production, fundamentally reversing the situation where most workshops failed to complete their production plans from January to August. All workshops continuously overfulfilled the state production plans in September and October. The Refractory Materials Department even fully completed its annual production plan on October 17th, 75 days ahead of schedule.

Starting in September, the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant launched a Red Flag Project competition based on the implementation of operation plans. The main content of the competition was, on the one hand, to mobilize workers to actively find shortcuts and propose rationalization suggestions, and on the other hand, to earnestly implement the suggestions of Soviet experts. In order to mobilize workers to find shortcuts and propose rationalization suggestions to solve key problems in production, the plant held forums for skilled workers, forums for engineers, technical conferences, technical exhibitions, and so on. These organizational efforts played a significant role. In September and October, workers in ten workshops, including steelmaking, ironmaking, coking, and electric furnace steelmaking, put forward more than 640 rationalization proposals. After these suggestions were implemented, the production outlook changed rapidly. Wu Fawang, a worker in the high-section steel production team of the Rolling Mill Department, automated the operation of the two lifting platform ground rollers for rolling medium-sized steel, fundamentally solving the problem that the operation of the lifting platform could not keep up with the needs of the rolling mill. This not only saved 15 man-hours per day but also increased work efficiency by eight times. Workers in the Refractory Materials Department implemented the "thermal curve" kiln firing method, which greatly shortened the firing cycle. For example, the firing time for each kiln of refractory bricks in Kiln No. 6 was reduced from 148 hours in the past to 94 hours.

Since September, the plant has implemented more than 200 suggestions from Soviet experts, which has improved the situation in key production links in many production procedures. For example, the central problem in the production of the Electric Furnace Steelmaking Department was to extend the life of the furnace wall and shorten the smelting time. Since September, the department has earnestly tried using magnesia furnace walls, and as a result, the steel produced per furnace wall replacement has increased by about 170% compared to the past. According to the suggestions of Soviet experts, the Steelmaking Department added blowers and implemented advanced operating methods such as "watching the stopwatch to test molten steel," which not only reduced the number of defective products caused by low furnace temperature but also shortened the average smelting time per furnace of steel by about 20 minutes. The Cold Casting Workshop also reduced the scrap rate of cast rolls by 80% compared to the past by implementing methods such as "rapid heating."

Since October, the plant has also fully launched a campaign to strengthen equipment maintenance and repair in the work of establishing a production responsibility system, gradually reducing production accidents.

    开展劳动竞赛解决生产中的关键问题
    太原钢铁厂连续超额完成计划
    【新华社太原五日电】国营太原钢铁厂在增产节约劳动竞赛中，解决了许多生产中的关键问题，从根本上扭转了一月至八月大部分车间不能完成生产计划的局面。各车间在九、十两个月连续超额完成了国家生产计划。耐火材料部并在十月十七日提前七十五天全面完成了全年生产计划。
    从九月份开始，太原钢铁厂在贯彻作业计划的基础上，展开了红旗课题竞赛。竞赛的内容主要是一方面发动职工积极找窍门提合理化建议，一方面认真实行苏联专家的建议。为发动职工找窍门提合理化建议解决生产中的关键问题，该厂曾召开了技术工人座谈会、工程师座谈会、技术会师会、技术展览会等。这些组织工作起了很大作用。九、十两月炼钢、炼铁、炼焦、电炉炼钢等十个车间的职工提出六百四十余条合理化建议。这些建议实现后，迅速改变了生产面貌。轧钢部高车生产组工人武发旺使轧中型钢材的两道升降机地辊的操作自动化，从根本上解决了升降机操作赶不上轧钢机需要的问题。这样，不仅每天节省了十五个人工，而且把工作效率提高了八倍。耐火材料部工人实行了“热成曲线”烧窑法，使烧成的周期大大缩短。如第六号窑每窑耐火砖的烧成时间，就由过去的一百四十八小时降低到九十四小时。
    从九月以来，全厂实行了苏联专家的建议二百余条，使许多生产程序中主要生产环节的情况得到了改进。如电炉炼钢部生产的中心问题是延长炉墙寿命、缩短冶炼时间。从九月以来，该部认真地试用了镁砂炉墙，结果电炉每换一次炉墙所出的钢比过去增加了百分之一百七十左右。炼钢部根据苏联专家建议，增加了吹风机，又实行了“看秒表试验钢水”等先进操作法，不仅减少了因炉温低而出的废品，而且把每炉钢冶炼时间平均缩短了二十分钟左右。冷铸车间也因实行了“快速加温”等方法，使铸造轧辊报废率比过去降低了百分之八十。
    从十月以后，该厂又在建立生产责任制工作中，全面地展开了加强设备维护检修运动，使生产事故逐渐减少。
