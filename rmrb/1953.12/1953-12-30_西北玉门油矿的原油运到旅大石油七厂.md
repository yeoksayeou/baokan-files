    [This newspaper reports] Crude oil produced by the Yumen Oil Mine in Gansu Province has been transported to the Dalian No. 7 Petroleum Factory in Northeast China's Dalian city after traversing a remote distance of over 7,000 li on December 15th.

    The Dalian No. 7 Petroleum Factory has been operating for twenty years since its establishment in 1933, and has never refined crude oil produced in our motherland. Since liberation, the potential capacity of the Dalian No. 7 Petroleum Factory has not been fully realized due to insufficient raw material supply. The arrival of crude oil from the Northwest is of great significance to promoting the factory's production development. Next year, the factory's equipment utilization rate can be increased by more than double compared to this year, and more petroleum can be produced to supply the needs of national construction and people's lives.

    The biggest feature of the crude oil produced by the Yumen Oil Mine is its high freezing point, which is most suitable for manufacturing lubricating oil. The Dalian No. 7 Petroleum Factory is currently stepping up its expansion project. Once the expansion project is completed, it can immediately use the crude oil transported from the Northwest to refine lubricating oil for industrial production and transportation.

    When the crude oil from the Northwest arrived, all the workers and staff of the Dalian No. 7 Petroleum Factory were overjoyed and held a celebration meeting on the same day. The director of the Dalian No. 7 Petroleum Factory called on all workers and staff to earnestly carry out major equipment overhaul, repair the machines, and refine the crude oil transported from the Northwest of the motherland to accelerate the construction of national industrialization. The Dalian No. 7 Petroleum Factory also sent a telegram to the workers and staff of the Yumen Oil Mine, thanking them for their support.

    西北玉门油矿的原油运到旅大石油七厂
    【本报讯】甘肃省玉门油矿生产的原油，越过了七千多里的遥远路程，已在十二月十五日运到东北旅大市石油七厂。
    旅大市石油七厂从一九三三年建厂以来，已经二十年了，从来没有炼制过祖国出产的原油。解放以来，旅大市石油七厂的潜在力量因受原料供应不足的限制，不能充分发挥。西北的原油运来之后，对促进该厂生产的发展有极大的意义，明年该厂的设备运用率可比今年提高一倍以上，可以生产出更多的石油，供给国家建设和人民生活的需要。
    玉门油矿出产的原油的最大特点是凝固点高，最适合于制造润滑油。旅大市石油七厂目前正在加紧进行扩建工程，扩建工程竣工后，立即就可以用西北运来的原油炼制润滑油，供给工业生产和交通运输业使用。
    当西北的原油运到的时候，旅大市石油七厂全厂职工欢欣鼓舞，并在当天举行了庆祝大会。旅大市石油七厂厂长号召全体职工认真做好设备大检修工作，把机器修理好，好炼制从祖国西北运来的原油，加速国家工业化的建设。旅大市石油七厂并打电报给玉门油矿职工，感谢他们的支援。
