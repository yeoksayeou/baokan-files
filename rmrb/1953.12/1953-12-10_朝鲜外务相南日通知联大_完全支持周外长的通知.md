Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 9th: DPRK Foreign Minister Nam Il sent a notification to the United Nations General Assembly on the 8th, fully supporting the notification of Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, to the United Nations General Assembly on December 7 regarding the current situation in Korea. The full text of Foreign Minister Nam Il's notification is as follows:

To His Excellency Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Hammarskjöld, New York, USA, and hoping that this notification will be forwarded to Mrs. Pandit, President of the Eighth Session of the United Nations General Assembly.

Since the realization of the Korean Military Armistice, the important provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement have been constantly obstructed due to the deliberate planning of the US side; as a result, serious events have now occurred in Korea.

The explanation work for prisoners of war by the Korean-Chinese side has been interrupted for a long time due to various despicable and vile sabotage by the US side, creating a serious situation that violates the relevant provisions of the Armistice Agreement.

The talks currently being held in Panmunjom regarding the issue of the Korean Political Conference have encountered difficulties due to the US side's unreasonable delaying tactics, failing to achieve the expected progress.

The Korean Armistice Agreement stipulates that non-directly repatriated prisoners of war shall be repatriated after ninety days of explanation in accordance with the provisions of the terms of reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. After the Korean-Chinese side began explanations on October 15th, explanations were conducted for only seven days, and explanation work has been unable to proceed since November 17th. The reason is that the US side used special agents of the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek gangs to continuously carry out activities of massacre and sabotage.

The US ruling clique, which had previously condoned the Syngman Rhee gang's shameful incident of forcibly detaining more than 27,000 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army, is now continuing to use this despicable means in the Tongchang-ri prisoner-of-war camp. The world's fair-minded public opinion cannot but express serious concern about this.

Recently, the Indian custodial forces intercepted secret US instructions from the US military command to the special agents of the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek gangs deployed in the prisoner-of-war camps, which clearly proves that the fundamental responsibility for the Korean-Chinese side's forced interruption of the explanation work to the prisoners of war lies with the US side.

These secret instructions from the US side confirm that the US military authorities directed the special agents of the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek gangs stationed in the prisoner-of-war camps to implement a cruel and inhumane policy of terror and assassination, obstruct the explanation work, and prevent prisoners of war from requesting repatriation, in order to continue the US side's consistent criminal conspiracy to forcibly detain captured personnel of the Korean-Chinese side.

According to these secret instructions from the US side, the brutal special agents are massacring Korean-Chinese captured personnel who demand repatriation, and are using extremely vicious terror methods, even digging out the hearts of prisoners of war and burning them. At the same time, the US side manipulates its special agents to prevent the smooth implementation of the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work" and to prevent the implementation of measures to isolate prisoners of war who have listened to the explanations from those who have not.

Even though the Korean-Chinese side's explanation work to the prisoners of war has been interrupted due to the US side's despicable and shameless instigation, the Korean-Chinese side's military authorities still provide the United Nations Command with all the conveniences to enable it to smoothly carry out the explanation work.

The Korean-Chinese side's military authorities have not imposed any suppression on the prisoners of war in the prisoner-of-war camps, but have helped them to freely listen to the explanations. At the same time, in accordance with the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work," various facilities for isolating prisoners of war have been provided.

In view of this unfair and unequal situation regarding the prisoners of war, the Korean-Chinese side, just as pointed out by Senior General Li Sang-cho, chief member of the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission on December 5th, firmly insists that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission must strictly exercise its legal powers in accordance with the provisions of the "Terms of Reference" and the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Interview Work," completely stop the atrocities of the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek gang special agents manipulated by the US side, and eliminate the special agent organizations.

In order to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, the Korean Armistice Agreement stipulates the convening of a higher-level political conference. Now, talks on the issue of the Korean Political Conference have been held in Panmunjom for a month and a half. In this meeting, the US side continued to stubbornly adopt shameless delaying tactics, wasting 18 days just in the discussion of the agenda issue. In order to stop this despicable trick of the US side and to quickly convene the political conference, the Korean-Chinese side put forward the fairest and most reasonable comprehensive proposal on November 30th. However, the US side has not shown any sincerity. On the issue of the members of the political conference, the US side ignores Article 37 of the Armistice Agreement regarding neutral countries, attempts to continue to deny the solemn status of the Soviet Union as a neutral country, and stubbornly adheres to unjust and unreasonable conditions for other neutral countries in Asia, and also uses various improper excuses on the issue of the time and place of the political conference to evade and delay serious discussion of the issue.

The above-mentioned destructive activities carried out by the US side in Korea prove that the US ruling clique is strongly opposed to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the easing of international tension, attempting to delay the convening of the political conference, so that the prisoner-of-war issue cannot be properly resolved in accordance with the terms of the Armistice Agreement, forcibly detaining Korean-Chinese captured personnel, and using them for new provocative purposes. The situation created in Korea as described above fully proves how correct the notification of Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, to the United Nations General Assembly on December 7th is. Therefore, I am authorized to represent the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and fully support the notification of Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, to the United Nations on December 7th regarding the current situation in Korea.

The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, supported by the progressive people of the whole world, considers that the vicious policy implemented by the US government in Korea will not only trample on the hopes of peace-loving people around the world who desire a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, but also bring serious negative results in the resolution of the Korean issue. Therefore, it believes that the United Nations General Assembly needs to take appropriate measures based on its original mission to stop the US government's dangerous planning on the Korean issue.

I am authorized to represent the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and issue the above notification to Your Excellency regarding the recent policy implemented by the US government in Korea, and hope that this notification will be forwarded to the representatives of the member states of the United Nations other than the Kuomintang remnant group.

Please accept, Your Excellency, my highest respect.

Nam Il
Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
Pyongyang, December 8, 1953

### 朝鲜外务相南日通知联大  完全支持周外长的通知

    朝鲜外务相南日通知联大
    完全支持周外长的通知
    【新华社平壤九日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日在八日发出给联合国大会的通知，完全支持中华人民共和国中央人民政府周恩来外交部长在十二月七日就朝鲜问题目前局势致联合国大会的通知。南日外务相的通知全文如下：
    美国纽约联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德阁下并望将这个通知转达联合国第八届大会主席潘迪特夫人。
    在朝鲜军事停战实现以后，朝鲜停战协定的各项重要规定，由于美方有意的策划，不断受到阻碍；结果，现在在朝鲜发生了严重的事态。
    朝中方面对战俘的解释工作，由于美方种种卑鄙恶劣的破坏而长时间陷于中断，造成了破坏停战协定的有关规定的严重局势。
    目前之板门店进行的关于朝鲜政治会议问题的会谈，由于美方不合理的拖延战术，未能得到预期的进展而碰到了难关。
    朝鲜停战协定规定：不直接遣返的战俘，根据中立国遣返委员会的职权范围的规定，经过九十天的解释予以遣返。朝中方面从十月十五日开始解释后，仅仅进行了七天的解释，从十一月十七日起解释工作就未能进行。原因是美方利用李承晚、蒋介石匪帮的特务不断进行屠杀和破坏的活动。
    过去曾纵容李承晚匪帮制造强迫扣留二万七千多名朝鲜人民军被俘人员的可耻事件的美国统治集团，现在又在东场里战俘营继续使用这种卑劣的手段。对此，全世界的公正舆论不能不表示重大的关心。
    最近，印度看管部队截获了美军司令部给布置在战俘营内的李承晚、蒋介石匪帮特务们的美方秘密指令，它清楚地证明：朝中方面不得已而中断对战俘的解释工作，其根本责任在于美方。
    美方的这种秘密指令证实了美国军事当局指挥布置在战俘营里的李承晚、蒋介石匪帮的特务分子，施行残酷的非人道的恐怖暗杀政策，阻挠解释工作，阻止战俘要求遣返，以继续进行美方强迫扣留朝中方面被俘人员的一贯的罪恶阴谋。
    依照美方这种秘密指令，残暴的特务分子屠杀着要求遣返的朝中被俘人员，并且使用着甚至挖出战俘的心脏用火焚烧的极其凶恶的恐怖手段。同时美方操纵它的特务分子使“解释和访问工作细则”不能顺利地实施，使隔离听过解释的战俘和未听解释的战俘的措施不能实行。
    尽管朝中方面对战俘的解释工作已因美方的这种卑鄙无耻的策动而告中断，朝中方面军事当局仍给予联合国军方面以能够顺利进行解释工作的一切便利。
    朝中方面军事当局对于战俘营内的战俘没有加以任何压制，而帮助他们自由地听取解释。同时依照“解释和访问工作细则”，提供了隔离战俘的各种设备。
    鉴于对战俘的这种不公正、不对等的情形，朝中方面，正如同十二月五日军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将在谈话中所指出的一样，坚决主张中立国遣返委员会必须根据“职权范围”和“解释和访问工作细则”的规定，严格执行其合法职权，完全制止美方操纵的李承晚、蒋介石匪帮特务分子的暴行和清除特务组织。
    为了和平解决朝鲜问题，朝鲜停战协定规定召开高一级的政治会议。现在，关于朝鲜政治会议问题的会谈已在板门店进行了一个半月。在这个会谈中，美方继续顽固地采取厚颜无耻的拖延战术，仅在议程问题的讨论中，就浪费了十八天的时日。朝中方面为了制止美方这种卑劣的伎俩和迅速召开政治会议，在十一月三十日提出了最公正最合理的全面提案。但是，美方迄未表示任何诚意。在政治会议的成员问题上，美方无视停战协定第三十七款关于中立国的规定，企图继续否认苏联作为中立国的严正地位，并对亚洲其他中立国固执着不正当和不合理的条件，对政治会议的时间和地点问题，也以各种不正当的藉口，回避和拖延问题的认真讨论。
    美方在朝鲜所进行的上述破坏性的活动证明：美国统治集团极力反对朝鲜问题的和平解决和国际紧张局势的缓和，企图拖延政治会议的召开，使战俘问题不能按照停战协定条款获得正当解决，强迫扣留朝中被俘人员，把他们利用于新的挑拨目的。现在在朝鲜造成的如上所述的事态充分证明：中华人民共和国中央人民政府周恩来外交部长十二月七日给联合国大会的通知是多么正当。因此，我受权代表朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府，完全支持中华人民共和国中央人民政府周恩来外交部长十二月七日就朝鲜的目前局势给联合国的通知。
    受到全世界进步人类支持的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府考虑到美国政府在朝鲜实行的凶恶政策，不仅会蹂躏渴望和平解决朝鲜问题的全世界爱好和平人民的热望，并且在朝鲜问题的解决上还会带来严重的否定的结果，因而认为联合国大会有必要基于自己本来的使命，采取制止美国政府对朝鲜问题的危险策划的适当措施。
    我受权代表朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府，就最近美国政府在朝鲜所施行的政策，向阁下发出如上的通知，并望把这个通知转达给除国民党残余集团以外的联合国各成员国代表。
    向阁下表示我的崇高敬意。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相  南日
    一九五三年十二月八日平壤
