Factories and mines affiliated with the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, as of the 5th of this month, already had thirty-six units that completed the annual state plan ahead of schedule. Among these factories and mines are ten units from Anshan Iron and Steel including the Medium Rolling Mill, Iron Smelting Plant, Medium Plate Mill, Thin Plate Mill, Steel Rope Plant, Dagushan Iron Mine, Gongchangling Iron Mine, Yingtaoyuan Iron Mine, Qidaogou Iron Mine, and Dalizi Iron Mine; six units from the Iron and Steel Industry Administration system including Tangshan Steel Plant, Asia Iron and Steel Plant, Shanghai Iron and Steel Company No. 2 Plant, Shanghai Iron and Steel Company No. 3 Plant, Xinhu Steel Plant, and 104 Steel Plant; eight units from the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration system including Liguo Iron Mine, Qijiang Iron Mine, Shenyang Smelting Plant, Kunming Smelting Plant, Tianbaoshan Mine, Laoniugou Mine, Xiuyan Mine, and Xikuangshan Mine; eleven units from the Building Materials Industry Administration system including the First Cement Plant, Third Cement Plant, Fourth Cement Plant, Liangcun Cement Plant, Taiyuan Cement Plant, Second Glass Factory, First Asbestos Tile Factory, Second Asbestos Tile Factory, First Cement Pipe Factory, First Paper Bag Factory, and Qixin Porcelain Factory; as well as the Shenyang Dye Factory in the chemical industry. In addition, the major products of four other key factories and mines, such as electric furnace steel from Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, pig iron from 101 Steel Plant, synthetic ammonia and nitric acid from Yongli Ning Plant, and caustic soda from Tianjin Chemical Plant, have also completed the state plan ahead of schedule.

However, among the factories and mines affiliated with the ministry, there are still a few units where the completion of the plan to date is relatively poor, and some factories and mines even have many equipment and personal accidents and poor quality due to crash production. Therefore, the ministry issued a circular to all administrations and factories and mines in early December, instructing all units to quickly correct the adverse phenomena in production and immediately prepare for next year's production.

    重工业部所属厂矿纷纷提前完成全年计划
    中央重工业部所属厂矿，到本月五日为止，已有三十六个单位提前完成了全年国家计划。这些厂矿中有鞍钢中型厂、炼铁厂、中板厂、薄板厂、钢绳厂、大孤山铁矿、弓长岭铁矿、樱桃园铁矿、七道沟铁矿、大栗子铁矿等十个单位，钢铁工业管理局系统有唐山钢厂、亚细亚钢铁厂、上海钢铁公司第二厂、上海钢铁公司第三厂、新沪钢厂、一○四钢铁厂等六个单位；有色金属工业管理局系统有利国铁矿、綦江铁矿、沈阳冶炼厂、昆明冶炼厂、天宝山矿、老牛沟矿、岫岩矿、锡矿山等八个单位；建筑材料工业管理局系统有第一水泥厂、第三水泥厂、第四水泥厂、两村水泥厂、太原水泥厂、第二玻璃厂、第一石棉瓦厂、第二石棉瓦厂、第一水泥管厂、第一纸袋厂、启新瓷厂等十一个单位；以及化学工业中的沈阳染料厂。此外，还有四个主要厂矿的部分主要产品如太原钢铁厂的电炉钢、一○一钢铁厂的生铁、永利宁厂的合成氨、硝酸及天津化工厂的烧碱等也提前完成了国家计划。
    但该部所属厂矿中仍有少数单位，到目前为止完成计划的情况较差，甚至有部分厂矿因突击生产造成设备、人身事故多，质量不好的情况。因而该部于十二月初向各管理局、各厂矿发出通报，指示各单位迅速纠正生产中的不良现象，并即时作好明年生产准备工作。
