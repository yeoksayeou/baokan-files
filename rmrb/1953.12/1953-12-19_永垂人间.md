Forever Among Us
Yan Zhao

　　During the recent activities of the Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea, I deeply realized the meaning of the phrase "the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people is a friendship cemented with blood." I was deeply moved by the following event.

　　It was the spring of 1952. Gujili Village, near the front lines of Jincheng, suffered a severe test of war. Enemy blockade fire constantly exploded here, houses were destroyed, cattle were killed, seedlings were overturned, and farmers planting the fields fell in pools of blood. In the village was Mother Kim, in her forties, whose husband and son had successively died under enemy fire. She personally buried her husband and then buried her son. She did not despair of life. She and her fifteen-year-old daughter, Kim Feng, continued to rush to plant under the threat of artillery fire. All of these circumstances were clearly seen by the Volunteer Army constructing fortifications on Baiyi Mountain near the village, further increasing their hatred of the enemy and their respect and sympathy for the Korean people. Ren Tingchang, the deputy squad leader of the Third Platoon machine gun squad of a certain unit, was particularly restless. He thought of the great motherland, of the peaceful life in his hometown of Xiushan County, Sichuan. He felt that the sacrifices that Mother Kim and others endured to rush the planting were not for themselves, but for his hometown of Xiushan County, for his motherland, for the cause of world peace. He felt as if Mother Kim was his own mother. He said to the soldiers in his squad: "We must help Mother Kim!" The next day, on May Day, Ren Tingchang took two soldiers from his squad, Xu Baotong and Yang Yansi, down the mountain to help Mother Kim with transplanting rice seedlings. At noon, the enemy suddenly launched a barrage of artillery fire. Ren Tingchang hurriedly told everyone to lie down. Forgetting himself, a shell exploded in the paddy field, and shrapnel hit him in the back and lower back. Bright red blood flowed onto the seedlings he had just planted. He fainted.

　　After a while, Ren Tingchang regained consciousness. He saw that he was lying in Mother Kim's arms, and Mother Kim's hot tears were dripping from her face onto his body. Her lips trembled as she called out: "Deputy Squad Leader, Deputy Squad Leader..." Xu Baotong, Yang Yansi, and Mother Kim's daughter, Kim Feng, were all by his side, anxiously watching his expression. Ren Tingchang struggled to open his eyes, looked at the seedlings that had not yet been transplanted, looked at Mother Kim and her daughter, and looked at his close comrades. With great effort, he said, "Comrades, don't worry about me, quickly transplant the seedlings, don't forget the autumn harvest, don't forget Mother Kim..." In this way, Ren Tingchang sacrificed his twenty-four-year-old youthful life.

　　Ren Tingchang thus sacrificed himself, but Ren Tingchang's spirit did not die. People came to Ren Tingchang's grave, not to mourn, but to take an oath. Park Jae-lang, the chairman of the village's Women's Alliance, and Mother Kim, who initiated the organization of the "Ren Tingchang Labor Team," said to the martyr's tomb: "We will continue to work under the enemy's artillery blockade, allowing the rice you planted to grow, thrive, and until the harvest! When the battle needs us, we will organize stretcher teams to support the front lines and rescue the wounded! We will never disgrace your name!"

　　Park Jae-deok, the chairman of the Gujili Labor Party, said to the martyr's tomb: "Volunteer Army comrades, you are such troops, risking your lives to fight the American devils, helping us with production, and not fearing sacrifice. I want to assure you: this year our whole village will not leave an acre of land uncultivated, strive for a bumper harvest, support the war, and support you!"

　　The battle on the Jincheng front began, and the Ren Tingchang Labor Team became a stretcher team in the battle, and Gujili's rice also had a bumper harvest.

　　In October, during the golden harvest season, the Second Chinese People's Delegation to Korea came to Gujili. The delegation paid tribute to the immortal son of the great motherland, Martyr Ren Tingchang, and visited the people of Gujili who were struggling hard in the flames of war. Mother Kim, holding the most precious gift—rice cake made from the rice personally planted by Martyr Ren Tingchang—treated the delegates of the delegation. Mother Kim said, while shedding tears: "Dear comrades, please eat! When you return to your motherland, please don't forget to tell the great Chairman Mao and the great Chinese people one thing: this grain was irrigated with the blood of our dear Chinese People's Volunteer Army Martyr Ren Tingchang!" The old woman said, sobbing, "This rice cake has his blood in it..."

　　Mother Kim left the rest of the rice and distributed it to the people of Gujili. She kindly instructed every villager: "For thousands of generations, you must plant this grain! This is the Ren Tingchang seed!"

　　Yes, Ren Tingchang's seeds are sown on the land of Korea, and Ren Tingchang's spirit lives in the hearts of the Korean people. Listen to the lyrics of the Korean people singing his praises: "Our dear Ren Tingchang! Now is the time of autumn harvest. This is the rice and sorghum you irrigated with blood, each grain growing fat and strong. We will keep it as seeds, sow it on the land of all of Korea, so that your name will be famous everywhere. These fragrant flowers, this plain wine, represent the hearts of millions of Korean people. We will work hard to produce, grow more grain, support the People's Army, support the Volunteer Army, avenge you, avenge us, your blood will not be shed in vain! The friendship between China and Korea will last forever!"

    永垂人间

　　在最近中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团的慰问活动中，使我深刻地体会到“中朝人民的友谊是血肉凝结成的友谊”这句话的意义。我深深地被下面这件事感动着。
      那是一九五二年的春天，临近金城前线的古直里村庄，受到了严重的战争考验，敌人的封锁炮火不断在这里爆炸，房屋被打垮，耕牛被炸死，秧苗被翻了过来，种地的农民倒在血泊里。村里有个金老大娘，四十多岁，她的丈夫和儿子先后在敌人的炮火下牺牲了，她亲手掩埋了丈夫又掩埋了儿子，她没有对生活绝望，她带着十五岁的姑娘金凤，继续在炮火威胁下抢种。所有这些情形，被村庄附近的白易山上修工事的志愿军看得十分清楚，更增加了他们对敌人的仇恨，对朝鲜人民的尊敬和同情。某部三排机枪班副班长任廷昌尤其不平静，他想起了伟大的祖国，想起了他的故乡四川秀山的和平生活，他觉得金老大娘们为抢种忍受的牺牲，不是为了她自己，而是为了他的故乡秀山县，为了他的祖国，为了全世界的和平事业，他仿佛觉得金老大娘就是他的亲生的母亲，他对班里的战士们说：“我们要帮助金老大娘！”第二天，正是五一劳动节，任廷昌就带着班里的两名战士许宝同和杨言思下山来帮助金老大娘插秧抢种。中午，敌人突然打来一阵排炮，任廷昌急忙招呼大家卧下，他忘了自己，炮弹在稻田里爆炸了，弹片打中了他的后背后腰部，鲜红的血淌在他刚插好的秧苗上。他昏倒过去了。
    稍许，任廷昌清醒了过来，他看看自己正躺在金老大娘的怀里，金老大娘的热泪从脸上往他身上滴，滴，她嘴唇颤动着在喊：“副班长，副班长……”许宝同，杨言思还有金老大娘的女孩金凤都在他的身边，焦急地注视着他的神情。任廷昌挣扎着睁大眼睛，看了看还没有插完的秧苗，看了看金老大娘母女，看了看他的亲密战友，很吃力地说道：“同志们，不要顾我，快把秧苗插上，不要忘记秋收，不要忘记金老大娘……”就这样，任廷昌献出了自己二十四岁的青春的生命。
    任廷昌就这样牺牲了，但任廷昌的精神不死，人们来到了任廷昌的墓前，来祭奠，不，是来宣誓。里女性同盟委员长朴在浪和金老大娘发起组织的“任廷昌劳动班”对着烈士的坟墓说：“我们要在敌人的炮火封锁下继续劳动，让你栽种的稻谷生长、茁壮直到丰收！我们要在战斗需要时，组织担架队，支援前线，抢救伤员！我们绝不会辱没你的名字！”
    古直里劳动党委员长朴在德对着烈士的坟墓说：“志愿军同志们，你们是这样的部队，打美国鬼子不顾性命，帮助我们生产，也不怕牺牲，我要向你们保证：今年我们全里决不荒一亩地，争取丰收，支援战争，支援你们！”
    金城前线的战斗开始了，任廷昌劳动班在战斗中成了一支担架队，古直里的稻谷也得到了丰收。
    十月，正是金黄色的丰收季节，古直里来了中国人民第二届赴朝慰问团。慰问团祭奠伟大祖国的不朽儿子任廷昌烈士，访问了在战火中艰苦斗争的古直里人民，金老大娘捧着最珍贵的礼品——任廷昌烈士亲手种上的稻谷作的糍粑，款待慰问团的代表们。金老大娘一边流泪一边讲：“亲爱的同志们，你们吃吧！请你们在回到自己祖国的时候，不要忘记告诉伟大的毛主席和伟大的中国人民一件事：这谷子是我们亲爱的中国人民志愿军任廷昌烈士用自己的鲜血灌溉出来的！”老大娘泣不成声地最后说了一句：“这糍粑里有他的鲜血呀……”
    金老大娘将其余的稻谷全部留下散发给古直里的人们，她亲切地嘱咐每一个老乡：“千秋万代，你们把这谷子种下去吧！这是任廷昌谷种！”
    是的，任廷昌的谷种撒在朝鲜的土地上，任廷昌的精神活在朝鲜人民的心里，请听朝鲜人民歌唱他的歌词吧：“我们亲爱的任廷昌！如今已是秋收时光，这是你用血浇种的稻谷高粱，一颗颗长得又肥又壮，我们要把它留作种子，撒在全朝鲜的土地上，让你的名字遍地流芳。这香花，这素酒，代表着千万个朝鲜人民的心。我们要努力生产，多打粮食，支援人民军，支援志愿军，为你报仇，为我们雪恨，你的血不会白流！中朝友谊万古长青！”
