    Exquisite Craftsmanship, Outstanding Creation
    ——After Viewing the Exhibition of Practical Arts of the German Democratic Republic
    Wu Lao
    Following the successful conclusion of the Industrial Exhibition of the German Democratic Republic, we are now delighted to welcome the Exhibition of Practical Arts of the German Democratic Republic in our capital.
    This exhibition is truly "dazzling," and all the exhibits are extremely exquisite. It displays more than nine hundred pieces of fine art and crafts made of various materials, including creations of various practical art forms from the heyday of Renaissance handicrafts (16th century) to the present day. These include bronzes, ceramics, woodwork, ironware, tinware, carpets, embroidery, textiles, printed fabrics, glassware, children's toys, etc. These exhibits demonstrate the wisdom of the German working people's artistic creation and the achievements of science and technology. They also illustrate the concern of the government of the German Democratic Republic for improving the people's artistic life and the importance it attaches to inheriting the national cultural traditions. The patterns, shapes, and colors of each handicraft item exhibited truly reflect the social life and artistic creation characteristics of the German nation. They represent a part of the excellent German culture. This exhibition will help the Chinese people better understand the development of the social culture of the German people and the direction of efforts of today's practical art workers.
    The creation of arts and crafts always serves the actual needs of life. Only the beauty expressed under the principle of the actual needs of life is the essence of the beauty of arts and crafts. Taking the porcelain pots exhibited in this exhibition as an example, the shape and decoration of each pot are suitable for practical requirements. For example, the spout pours water smoothly, the handle is easy to hold and firmly attached to the pot body with a sense of solidity, and the entire porcelain pot is stable in shape, the glaze is harmonious, the volume and weight are appropriate, and the firing temperature in the kiln is scientifically controlled. Because of these practical conditions, all the porcelain pots are practical and beautiful.
    From the exhibits, we can see that the practical utensils made in Germany from the 16th century to the mid-19th century, such as these exquisite castings made of tin, iron, brass, and red copper, were also designed according to this principle. Another example is several wooden and pottery containers with a layer of tin decoration on the outside. The patterns of this tin decoration are appropriately arranged according to the proportions of the shape, which not only increases the beauty but also makes the utensils durable. This proves that the creators of arts and crafts understand best that practicality is the starting point of beauty. Of course, it is incorrect to only require "use" of arts and crafts and think that there is no need to pay attention to beauty. Furthermore, overly complicated decorations, or decorations that deviate from practicality or even hinder practicality, are even more inappropriate. These exhibits clearly tell us about this principle, which is indeed worth learning for designers engaged in arts and crafts.
    In the 18th and 19th centuries, metal casting works in Germany were very exquisite. This can be seen on the ancient buildings in major cities such as Leipzig, Dresden, and Berlin, where many large-scale copper-cast human and animal-shaped decorations add vitality to the static buildings and make them appear magnificent and majestic. In the exhibits, such as the statues and castings of Goethe and Wieland, Humboldt and Bruhl, as well as a bronze bell from Marx City, we can imagine the development and beauty of its casting art. In the porcelain sculptures, the expressions and postures of figures such as the insurgents of Paris, various German craftsmen and fishmongers, flower girls, shepherds, and gardening couples are all very realistic and vividly reflect the people's lives and struggles.
    The production of German porcelain actually began in Meissen in the 18th century. In the early days, the shapes, patterns, and glazes of porcelain were mostly imitated from Chinese imported porcelain. After a considerable period of integration, simple and pure white-glazed porcelain with its own national characteristics was created. The Meissen porcelain factory, with large-scale scientific and modern equipment, produces a large number of daily-use porcelain and exquisite art porcelain. Its porcelain quality and artistic processing have reached an astonishing level.
    The development of children's toy manufacturing also illustrates the improvement of the cultural life of the people of the German Democratic Republic and the importance attached to the education of the new generation. The many dolls on display, each with such a moving and lovely little face, are adorned with clothing of various working people from different professions, so that children can develop an interest in and concepts of loving labor from toys. Among the animal toys, leisurely sheep, galloping horses, grazing cattle, pecking chickens, barking dogs... the shapes and expressions of these birds and animals skillfully express their characteristics, making them lively and very popular. Mechanized toys, such as house models, electric toy trains, excavators, tractors, steam engines, automobiles, etc., can guide and inspire children's interest in scientific and technological research, develop and nurture children's ability to "assemble" and "structure" as well as operational accuracy, and make this character highly effective, which is of great value. These toys educate children to love peace, love labor, love science, and love beautiful things, so that people can develop excellent moral character from an early age.
    Material is a major condition for the production of crafts. The development of general crafts is often determined by the special materials of its place of origin. However, the scientists of the German Democratic Republic have overcome the limitations of natural conditions with amazing wisdom. For example, the textiles on display are generally thought to be processed from cotton and wool raw materials. No one would have thought that they were woven from chemical fibers. The colors and patterns give people a very pleasing feeling, and the texture is firm and soft. This is the new material created by the ingenious German people.
    Design experts in the German Democratic Republic also attach great importance to practical knowledge of production. I once met Professor Lindler making large-scale murals of colorful porcelain tiles. He and the technical workers repeatedly studied and successfully completed it. Now this mural has been installed on public buildings in Berlin. The reason why these exhibits can achieve such harmony in the combination of practicality and beauty is inseparable from the efforts of experts in combining theory with practice.
    From the antiques exhibited in the first hall, we learned about the rich heritage of national culture inherited by the German people in terms of practical art. From the modern products displayed in the second hall, those beautiful textiles, ceramics, glassware, etc., we were even more amazed by the creation of practical art by the German people, whose quality has reached an extremely high level of science and technology. Because the power of the German Democratic Republic is in the hands of the working people themselves, the production of these products has been restored and developed in just a few years after liberation. As soon as I saw these exquisite utensils, I immediately thought of the decorations I saw in the homes of farmers when I visited the German countryside last year, which are exactly the same as these. They have become very common supplies for the daily use of the people throughout the German Democratic Republic.
    Everyone who has visited the Exhibition of Practical Arts of the German Democratic Republic unanimously praised: The strength of the German people is great and admirable, and their ingenious creations are infinite and admirable.

    精美的工艺，出色的创造
    ——德意志民主共和国实用艺术展览会观后
    吴劳
    继德意志民主共和国工业展览会胜利闭幕之后，我们又欣幸地在我们的首都欢迎德意志民主共和国实用艺术展览会的举行。
    这个展览会，真是所谓“琳琅满目”，所有展品，都精美极了。它陈列了各种不同材料所制成的九百余件美术工艺品，包括从文艺复兴手工艺全盛时代（十六世纪）起，直到现代的各种实用艺术品的创作，其中有铜器、陶瓷、木器、铁器、锡器、地毯、刺绣、纺织、印花布、玻璃器皿、儿童玩具等。这些展品，显示了德意志劳动人民艺术创造的智慧与科学技术的成就，也说明了德意志民主共和国政府对提高人民艺术生活的关怀和对继承民族传统文化的重视。展出的每一件工艺品的纹样、造型、色彩，都真实地反映出德意志民族的社会生活和艺术创造的特色，它们代表了德意志优秀文化的一部分。这次的展出，将帮助中国人民更加了解德意志人民的社会文化的发展，以及今天实用艺术工作者努力的方向。
    工艺美术品的创作总是服从于生活的实际需要，只有在生活的实际需要的原则下所表现出来的美，才是工艺美术的美的本质。以这次展览中展出的瓷壶为例，每一种壶的造型与装饰都是适合于实用的要求的。如壶口倒水流畅，把手便于执握并坚附壶身而有结实之感，以及整个瓷壶造型的安定，釉彩的调和，容积和重量的恰当，入窑火度的科学掌握等等，由于具备了这些实际的条件，所有瓷壶都是实用而又美观的。
    从展品中看到德意志十六世纪至十九世纪中叶这时期制造的实用器具，如锡、铁、黄铜、红铜等这些精美的铸造品，也同样是根据这个原则设计的。再如几件木制和陶质的容器，它的外体包一层锡的装饰，这种锡的装饰纹样依着造型的比例恰当的安排着，不仅增加了美感，同时也使器物经久耐用。这证明工艺美术的创造者，是最懂得：实用才是美的出发点。当然，对工艺美术品只要求“用”，认为不必讲究美的观点，是不正确的，而过于繁琐的装饰，或脱离了实用甚至妨碍了实用的装饰，更是不妥当的。在这些展品里，都很清楚的告诉了我们关于这个道理，这确是很值得从事工艺美术的设计者学习的。
    德意志在十八世纪至十九世纪，金属熔铸的作品是很精致的。这在莱比锡、德累斯顿、柏林等各大城市的古建筑物上，可以看见许多大件铜铸的人形、兽形的装饰品，使静的建筑物增加生气，显得壮观雄伟。展品中，如哥德与韦兰德、洪波特与布鲁希尔的雕像和铸版，以及马克思城的一口铜钟，可以使我们想见其熔铸艺术的发达和美妙。在瓷器的塑造品中，如巴黎起义者，德意志各种手工业者和卖鱼妇、卖花女、牧羊者、园丁夫妇等人物的表情和姿态都表现得非常真实生动，出色地反映了人民的生活与斗争。
    德意志瓷器的制作，实始于十八世纪的麦生地方。在初期瓷器的造型、纹样、釉彩，大多是仿照中国输入的瓷器，经过相当时期的融会，才创造了具有自己民族特色的那样朴素精纯的白釉瓷。具有大规模的科学化现代设备的麦生瓷器厂，出产的大批日用瓷器和精美的美术瓷，其瓷质和艺术加工，已达到惊人的水平。
    儿童玩具制造的发达，也说明了德意志民主共和国人民文化生活的提高和对于新一代的教育工作的重视。展出的许多洋娃娃，每个小脸都是那么的动人、可爱，身上饰以各种不同职业的劳动人民的服装，借此使得儿童们能从玩具中养成爱好劳动的兴趣和观念。在走兽的玩具中，悠闲的羊、驰奔的马、吃草的牛、啄食的鸡、奔吠的狗……这些禽兽的形态和神情都很巧妙地表现了它们的特点，因而生动活泼，非常受人喜爱。机械化的玩具，如房屋的模型、电动的小火车、挖泥机、拖拉机、蒸汽机、汽车等等，能引导和启发儿童对科学技术研究的兴趣，发展和养成儿童“拼合”和“结构”的能力以及操作的精确性，并使这种性格能高度地发挥起来，是有很大作用的。这些玩具，教育儿童爱和平、爱劳动、爱科学、爱美好的事物，使人们从小就养成优美的品德。
    材料对工艺品的制作是一个重大的条件，一般工艺的发展，常常决定于其产地的特殊材料。然而德意志民主共和国的科学家，却用惊人的智慧战胜了自然条件的限制。例如展出的那些纺织品，人们总以为是棉、毛原料的加工品，谁也不会想到它是化学纤维所织成，它的颜色和纹样给人的感觉是异常悦目的，质地坚厚而又柔软。这就是天才的德意志人民创造出来的新的物质。
    德意志民主共和国的设计专家还很重视生产的实际知识。我曾遇见林德勒教授制作五彩瓷砖的大壁画，他与技术工人们反复的研究，才完满地成功。现在这壁画已安装在柏林的公共建筑物上。这里所展出的这些展品，其所以在实用与美观两者的结合上能达到如此的和谐，是和专家们的理论结合实际的努力分不开的。
    从第一馆展出的古物，使我们认识了德意志人民在实用艺术方面所继承的民族文化的丰富遗产。从第二馆陈列的现代产品，那些美丽的纺织物、陶瓷、玻璃器皿等等，更使我们惊佩德意志人民实用艺术的创造，其质量都已达到极高度的科学技术水平。由于德意志民主共和国的政权掌握在劳动人民自己的手里，在解放后短短几年中，已经恢复并发展了这些产品的生产。我一见到这些精美的器物，立即联想起去年我参观德国的农村时，在农民的家里，所见到的和这些正是一样的那些摆设，它们已成为德意志民主共和国全国人民日常享用的极普通的用品了。
    每一个参观了德意志民主共和国实用艺术展览会的人都一致地称赞：德意志人民的力量是伟大的、可敬的，他们智慧的创造是无穷的、可佩的。
