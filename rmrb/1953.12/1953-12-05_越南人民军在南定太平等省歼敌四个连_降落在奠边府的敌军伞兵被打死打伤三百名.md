Xinhua News Agency, 4th: According to Vietnam News Agency, the recently published communique stated that in late November, the Vietnamese People's Army annihilated four enemy companies in the provinces of Nam Dinh, Thai Binh, and Guang'an in North Vietnam, and strengthened the guerrilla warfare in the Red River area; victories were also achieved in battles in Long Châu Sa, Gia Định Ninh provinces in South Vietnam.

　　On November 21 and 22, the Vietnamese People's Army launched four counter-"sweeping" operations in the southern area of Bui Chu in Nam Dinh province, annihilating 210 enemy soldiers, most of whom belonged to the French Army's Second Mobile Group. At 7:00 AM on November 27, in an ambush conducted by the Vietnamese People's Army 500 meters from the capital of Nam Dinh province, after only three minutes of combat, a company of the puppet army's 707th Light Infantry Battalion was completely annihilated, and 103 light machine guns, submachine guns, and carbines were seized.

　　On November 27, the enemy gathered two battalions of mobile troops, attempting to land and "sweep" the base area in the southern region of Kien Xuong County, Thai Binh Province. However, as soon as these two battalions landed 22 kilometers southeast of the capital of Thai Binh province, they were fiercely intercepted by the Vietnamese People's Army. In this battle, the People's Army annihilated 150 enemy soldiers, mostly European and African, and destroyed two amphibious tanks and three amphibious vehicles.

　　On November 26, the enemy's Third Mobile Group "swept" the An Bai area in Guang'an Province, 60 kilometers east of Hanoi. The People's Army launched a counterattack on the same day, annihilating more than 100 enemy mobile troops.

　　In addition, since November, the Vietnamese People's Army and guerrillas have been actively fighting in the eastern region of South Vietnam, achieving good results. From November 2 to 8, the People's Army sank two enemy gunboats in Tan Chau, Long Châu Sa province (formed by merging all of Sa Dec province and the areas of Long Xuyen and Chau Doc provinces on the left bank of the Ba Sa River). All personnel on board were drowned. On November 19, guerrillas ambushed an enemy force on Highway 26 in Gia Định Ninh province (formed by merging Gia Định and Tay Ninh provinces), killing many enemies, and also killing 40 French reinforcements, including two captains and one lieutenant.

Xinhua News Agency, 4th: According to Vietnam News Agency, the "Voice of Vietnam" radio broadcast on the 2nd that enemy paratroopers airdropped into Dien Bien Phu (100 kilometers south of the capital of Lai Châu Province) on November 20 were fiercely attacked by a Vietnamese People's Army unit as soon as they landed. According to recent reports, 200 enemy soldiers were killed and 100 were wounded, most of whom were European and African soldiers.

　　Since then, the People's Army and guerrillas have launched continuous attacks on the enemy in Dien Bien Phu, making it impossible for the enemy to stray far from their strongholds. Residents near Dien Bien Phu are actively assisting the People's Army in fighting the enemy.

    十一月二十七日，敌军纠集了两营机动部队，企图登陆“扫荡”太平省建昌县南部地区的根据地。但是，这两营敌军在距太平省会东南二十二公里处刚一登陆，就遭到越南人民军猛烈的截击。这次战斗，人民军共歼灭大部是欧非籍的敌军一百五十名，并击毁了水陆两用坦克二辆、水陆两用汽车三辆。
