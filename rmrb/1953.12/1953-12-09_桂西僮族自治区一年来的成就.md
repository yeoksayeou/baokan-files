    Achievements of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region in the Past Year
    He Jiali
    The Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region was established on December 9th of last year and is an autonomous region equivalent to an administrative office. The autonomous region governs a total of thirty-eight counties and three other minority autonomous regions equivalent to counties; the total area is 134,463 square kilometers. Within the autonomous region, in addition to the Zhuang ethnic group, there are eleven other minority ethnic groups such as Miao, Yao, and Dong, as well as Han people. Among them, the Zhuang people number approximately 5.4 million, the Miao, Yao, and Dong ethnic groups together number about 600,000, and the Han people number about 2.3 million. The total population of the autonomous region is about 8.4 million. This is the most populous autonomous region among the ethnic autonomous regions that have been established in our country.
    In the year since the establishment of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the people of all ethnic groups in Guixi, under the direct leadership of the Autonomous Region People's Government, have made the autonomous region even more beautiful, and political, economic, and cultural undertakings within the autonomous region have been universally developed. First of all, after the establishment of the autonomous region, a new atmosphere of ethnic unity that has never existed before has emerged in the Guixi region. For example, Zhuang farmers in Zuodeng Street, Third District, Tiandong County, gave more than 3,000 catties of grain from their land reform struggle to the Yao brothers in Xinfaxiang, who were short of grain. Over 200 men and women went to deliver it with gongs and drums. The Yao people also gathered more than 100 people to greet them halfway with gratitude. When 31 households of Yao compatriots in Langhan Village, Sixth District, Fengshan County, moved down the mountain, many Zhuang farmers automatically helped the Yao compatriots build houses. When Xinzao Township, Jingxi County, discovered that more than 200 monkeys were damaging crops, the Zhuang people in the township, lacking experience in hunting monkeys, asked the Miao brothers, who had experience in hunting monkeys, for help. The Miao brothers helped them hunt all the monkeys. These new things have never happened in history, but now they can be seen and heard in every mountain city and village in Guixi. The people of all ethnic groups have closely united together, eliminating the mutual hatred and distrust between ethnic groups that were created in history.
    After the establishment of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the Zhuang people more actively united the people of all fraternal ethnic groups, and actively responded to the call of the state and the call of the Autonomous Region People's Government. This spring, under the direct leadership of the Autonomous Region People's Government, the Zhuang people continued to carry out the land reform movement, liberating the productive forces and further raising their level of awareness. At the same time, the Zhuang people united the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region to launch a patriotic production increase movement and develop agricultural production.
    With the active efforts of the people of all ethnic groups and the help of the People's Government, more than 10,000 small-scale water conservancy projects were built in the autonomous region this year, and four large-scale water conservancy projects and six pumping stations were built. These water conservancy projects have expanded and consolidated the benefited farmland to one million mu. Among them, the Binyang Tanglai Reservoir, one of the large-scale water conservancy projects, can irrigate more than 30,000 mu of farmland. This not only protects the farmland in many areas from the threat of drought, but also turns single-season rice fields into double-season rice fields in some areas. For example, Zhuang farmers in Bapen Village, Fusu County, converted more than 1,800 mu of land to grow two crops, greatly increasing grain production. The highest yield per mu of early rice reached more than 670 catties. In order to meet the production and living needs of farmers of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region, the People's Government issued more than 43 billion yuan in agricultural loans and more than 10 billion yuan in relief funds. According to incomplete statistics, farmers of all ethnic groups have used this batch of loans to purchase more than 13,000 heads of cattle, more than 170,000 pieces of agricultural implements, and more than 12,000 dan of seeds. Many farmers have solved the difficulty of lacking the means of production. Everyone said: Chairman Mao values us so much and lets us be the masters of our own affairs, and also lends us money. If we don't work hard to produce, we will be letting down Chairman Mao.
    The Zhuang people have rich experience in agricultural production and are one of the ethnic groups in our country that learned to grow rice very early. The rice they grow is neat and even, and the seedlings grow very strong. At the same time, they have long had the habit of "helping each other" (mutual aid). This year, after the victory of the land reform, in order to meet the needs of developing production, under the correct leadership of the Autonomous Region People's Government, this good habit of "helping each other" has been greatly improved on the original basis, and the mutual aid and cooperation movement has also flourished. In the original Yongning Special Zone's fifteen counties and the counties of Yishan Special Zone alone, there are more than 52,000 mutual aid groups, with a total of more than 880,000 participants, including more than 2,800 permanent mutual aid groups. In Longshou Village, Longxian Township, Jingxi County, Baise Special Zone, there were no mutual aid groups last year, but this year 18 mutual aid groups have been organized. This year, the mutual aid groups generally achieved bumper harvests, and many model mutual aid groups and labor models emerged. The Li Chunhua model mutual aid group in Pingguo County increased grain production by 34% this year compared to last year. Women of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region have also organized themselves. Their labor is as strong as men's. Currently, the number of women participating in mutual aid groups accounts for more than 15% of the total number of working women in the autonomous region. The Yang Zulu mutual aid group in Binyang County, which includes some working women, increased rice production by 79% compared to when they worked individually in 1951. Many counties in the autonomous region have held labor model conferences to further promote production.
    This year, some areas in the autonomous region suffered from drought, but thanks to the unity of the people of all ethnic groups and the leadership cadres of the People's Governments at all levels deeply mobilizing the masses and organizing them to find water sources to fight the drought, statistics by the end of August showed that 400,000 mu of farmland had been rescued, and the drought was overcome. Wild animals harming crops is a historical disaster in the local area. In order to protect the production and life safety of the people of all ethnic groups, the Autonomous Region People's Government organized farmers to hunt during the slack season, and also achieved remarkable results. Many areas have basically eliminated the disaster of wild animals. For example, Yao farmers in the Seventh District of Longlin County hunted 228 tigers, wild boars, porcupines, etc. in half a year.
    This year, all seasonal crops in the autonomous region have achieved bumper harvests. Early rice generally increased by 5% compared to last year, and many counties increased by an average of more than 10%. Intermediate rice, soybeans, and corn have also achieved bumper harvests. In the poorest Baise Special Zone in the autonomous region, intermediate rice, soybeans, and corn have also increased by more than 15%. According to statistics from ten townships in the Fifth District of Jingxi County in the special zone, grain production this year increased by 26% compared to last year. In Liming and Longsheng Townships in the Second District of Zhendu County, soybean production increased by one million catties compared to last year. In order to further respond to Chairman Mao's call for "increasing production and practicing economy," Zhuang farmers and farmers of other ethnic groups created various methods of conservation during the autumn harvest, changed the past phenomenon of not paying attention to the loss of rice during harvesting, and generally achieved "every grain returns home," "harvest well, thresh well, dry well, and store well." For example, Zhuang and Han farmers in Datong Township, Baise County, came up with various active methods, so that each mu of land lost one to two catties less of rice, and the entire township harvested more than 4,700 catties more. After the bumper harvest, Zhuang farmers united with brothers of all ethnic groups to actively respond to the government's call to sell surplus grain to the state to support industrial construction. For example, the Liang Zengcheng mutual aid group of three Zhuang farmer households in Shijing Township, Heng County, sold more than 2,900 catties of surplus grain to the state after the early rice harvest. Huang Kun, a labor model in Tianyang County, sold 1,000 catties of grain and 700 catties of rice to the state and prepared to sell another 2,200 catties of grain. Farmers of all ethnic groups enthusiastically paid patriotic public grain and guaranteed that the public grain they delivered was "completely dry, completely clean, and completely full," delivered quickly, and did not leave any arrears. They said: "Public grain is given to the state, but it is still for ourselves. If the public grain is bad, we will still suffer."
    With the development of production, the lives of people of all ethnic groups have also generally improved. This year, the market in the autonomous region has greatly become active. According to this development, the trade departments of the autonomous region have increased the number of trade institutions set up in the primary market by 22% compared to last year, and have generally organized mobile purchase and sales teams. According to preliminary statistics, the agricultural implements, cotton yarn, kerosene, handicrafts, etc. supplied by trade institutions to the people of all ethnic groups have increased by an average of one to three times compared to the same period last year. Guixi is rich in local specialties and is known as a "warehouse of local products." The trade departments have also increased funds and vigorously purchased local specialties in the autonomous region. In the first half of this year, the funds invested in purchasing local specialties such as yellow sugar, white sugar, star anise (ie fennel), medicinal materials, cloud ears, wood ears, and live pigs increased by 22% compared to the same period last year. The prices of local specialties have also been reasonably increased. For example, during the Kuomintang rule, one catty of star anise could only be exchanged for one catty of grain or four taels of salt, but now one catty of star anise is worth ten catties of grain. The tung oil and tea oil produced in large quantities in the autonomous region also have sales this year. Therefore, the living standards of ethnic minorities who rely on selling local specialties have improved rapidly. The impoverished state of "half a year of bran and vegetables, half a year of grain" has basically been eliminated in the autonomous region.
    After the material lives of people of all ethnic groups have improved, their demands for culture have become even more urgent. In order to meet this need, the Autonomous Region People's Government has expanded and built cultural centers and radio stations in various counties in the region; increased the number of ethnic middle schools, ethnic normal schools, and general schools, and expanded the equipment of existing schools. The number of complete primary schools and township primary schools in the Baise Special Zone under the jurisdiction of the Autonomous Region alone has increased to 3,904, and the number of students has increased to 269,479. For example, the number of students in the Second Complete Primary School in the First District of Baise County has increased fourfold compared to 1950. On average, there are more than two complete primary schools in each district and two to three township primary schools in each township in the entire Baise Special Zone. With the help of the People's Government, 166 more classes were added to ethnic primary schools and the number of ethnic primary school teachers also increased to more than 6,400 in the entire special zone in the second half of this year. Most teachers have learned ethnic languages and teach in ethnic languages. The number of secondary schools in the entire special zone has increased to thirteen, and there are also two normal schools. There are a total of 6,935 students in middle schools and normal schools. This year, the autonomous region has cultivated and promoted a large number of ethnic cadres, and relevant special zones have established ethnic cadre training classes. Up to now, the number of ethnic cadres trained and being trained by ethnic cadre training classes and the Guangxi Ethnic College has reached 1,343. The autonomous region has also focused on establishing ethnic hospitals and expanding county health centers, and adding health clinics. In addition, mobile medical teams are organized to go to the countryside to treat people of all ethnic groups. Due to the development of health work, the spread of epidemics has now been basically stopped. The autonomous region has also trained a large number of health workers. For example, the Baise Special Zone has trained 600 health workers and 286 midwives from all ethnic groups, and the special zone medical school is training hundreds of health cadres.
    In carrying out various tasks, the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region People's Government has attached importance to the development of other ethnic minorities in the autonomous region, and paid special attention to solving the special difficulties of other ethnic minorities. This year, in order to solve the fundamental problems of the Yao, Miao, and other ethnic minorities living in mountainous areas with extremely poor production conditions, the Autonomous Region People's Government has carried out immigration work. With the help of the Guangxi Provincial People's Government, more than 20,000 Yao, Miao, and other ethnic people living in mountainous areas will be moved to Zhuang and Han areas with more and better land in succession, in order to further strengthen ethnic unity and develop production.
    Since the implementation of regional autonomy for the Zhuang people in Guangxi Province, the unprecedented development in politics, economy, and culture is inseparable from the concern and help of the Central People's Government and the higher-level People's Governments, in addition to the efforts of the Zhuang people themselves. The Guangxi Provincial People's Government has always attached importance to the development of the Zhuang people and other ethnic minorities in the province, and has done a lot of work in leading the production of various ethnic minority areas, promoting ethnic regional autonomy, and training ethnic cadres. Recently, the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a meeting on ethnic work to summarize the experience of promoting ethnic regional autonomy and training ethnic cadres, and studied other issues related to ethnic work. This is of great help to the further development of work in the Zhuang Autonomous Region and other ethnic minority autonomous regions in Guangxi Province.
    The achievements of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region in the past year have powerfully illustrated the correctness and greatness of Chairman Mao's policy of ethnic regional autonomy. As pointed out in the "Basic Summary of the Experience of Promoting Ethnic Regional Autonomy" of the Third (Expanded) Meeting of the Ethnic Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, the implementation of ethnic regional autonomy "enhanced the patriotism, enthusiasm, and initiative of the people of all ethnic groups," "strengthened the unity between ethnic groups and within each ethnic group," "close the ties between the autonomous organs and the people," and "gradually promoted the political, economic, and cultural development of various ethnic minorities."

    桂西僮族自治区一年来的成就
    何家礼
    桂西僮族自治区成立于去年十二月九日，是相当于行署一级的自治区。自治区共辖三十八个县和三个相当于县一级的其他少数民族自治区；总面积共为一三四、四六三平方公里；自治区境内，除僮族外，还有苗、瑶、侗等十一个少数民族和汉族人民；其中僮族约五百四十万人，苗、瑶、侗等少数民族共约六十余万人，汉族约二百三十万人，全自治区人口共约八百四十万人。这是我国目前已建立的民族自治区中人口最多的一个自治区。
    桂西僮族自治区成立一年来，桂西各族人民，在自治区人民政府的直接领导下，已把自治区建设得更加美好了；自治区内的政治、经济、文化事业都得到了普遍的发展。首先，自治区成立后，在桂西地区内出现了从来没有的民族团结的新气象。如田东县三区作登街的僮族农民，在土地改革中把三千多斤粮食的斗争果实送给了缺粮的新发乡的瑶族兄弟，男女二百多人敲锣打鼓送去；瑶族人民也集合一百多人以感激的心情来半路迎接。凤山县六区朗汉屯瑶胞三十一户移住山下时，许多僮族农民自动去帮助瑶胞盖房子。靖西县新造乡发现有二百多只猴子损害农作物，这乡僮族人民因缺乏打猴子的经验，就去请打猴子有经验的苗族兄弟来帮助；苗族兄弟一直帮助他们把猴子打完。这些新事情，是历史上从来没有过的，但现在在桂西的每一个山城和乡村，都可以看到和听到。各族人民已经亲密地团结在一起，消除了历史上造成的民族间的互相仇视和互不信任心理。
    桂西僮族自治区成立后，僮族人民更加主动地团结各兄弟民族人民，积极响应国家的号召和自治区人民政府的号召。今年春天，僮族人民在自治区人民政府的直接领导下，继续开展了土地改革运动，解放了生产力，并进一步提高了自己的觉悟程度。同时，僮族人民团结自治区内各族人民展开了爱国增产运动，发展了农业生产。
    在各族人民的积极努力和人民政府的帮助下，自治区内今年共兴修小型水利一万多处，修建大型水利工程四处、抽水机站六个。这些水利工程共扩大与巩固受益农田达一百万亩，其中仅大型水利工程之一的宾阳塘来水库即可灌溉农田三万多亩。这样不但使很多地区的农田免受旱灾的威胁，而且已使部分地区的一季稻田变成了二季稻田。如扶绥县岜盆村僮族农民改种两造的田即有一千八百多亩，大量增产了粮食，早稻的每亩最高产量有达六百七十多斤的。人民政府为了满足自治区内各族农民生产上和生活上的要求，并发放了四百三十多亿元的农业贷款，一百多亿元的救济金。据不完全统计：各族农民用这批贷款已购得耕牛一万三千多头，农具十七万多件，种籽一万二千多担，很多农户都解决了缺乏生产资料的困难。人人都讲：毛主席这样看重我们，让我们当家作主了，又贷给我们款，再不努力生产，就对不起毛主席。
    僮族人民在农业生产方面是有丰富的经验的，是我国历史上很早就学会种水稻的民族之一。他们种的水稻整齐而均匀，禾苗也长得很结实；同时，他们很早就有了“帮工背工”（变工互助）的习惯。今年土地改革胜利完成后，为适应发展生产的需要，在自治区人民政府的正确领导下，这种“帮工背工”的优良习惯，已在原有基础上大大提高了一步，互助合作运动也蓬勃地展开了。仅原邕宁专区的十五个县和宜山专区各县就有互助组五万二千多个，参加人数共八十八万多人，其中常年互助组有二千八百多个。百色专区靖西县龙显乡龙首屯去年没有帮工互助组，今年已组织了十八个互助组。今年互助组一般都获得了丰收，并出现了不少模范互助组和劳动模范。平果县李春花模范互助组所种谷物，今年就比去年增产三成四。自治区内各族妇女也组织起来了。她们的劳动和男人一样强，目前参加互助组的妇女，已占全自治区劳动妇女百分之十五以上。宾阳县包括一部分劳动妇女的杨祖露互助组水稻产量比一九五一年分散单干时增加了七成九。自治区内不少县份都召开了劳动模范大会，进一步推动了生产。
    今年自治区内，部分地区曾遭受旱灾，但由于各族人民团结一致，各级人民政府领导干部深入发动群众，组织群众找水源抗旱，至八月底的统计，就抢救了四十万亩田地，战胜了旱灾。野兽危害农作物在当地是历史性的灾害，自治区人民政府为了保障各族人民生产和生命的安全，在农闲时就组织农民打猎，也获得了显著的成绩。很多地区基本上消灭了兽灾。如隆林县七区瑶族农民在半年内，就打得老虎、山猪、箭猪等二百二十八只。
    自治区内今年各季农作物都获得了丰收。早稻一般比去年增产百分之五，许多县则平均增产一成以上。中稻、黄豆、玉米亦已得到丰收；自治区内最贫瘠的百色专区，今年中稻、黄豆、玉米也增产一成五以上。该专区靖西县第五区的十个乡的统计，今年粮食产量比去年增加二成六。镇都县二区黎明、龙盛等乡的黄豆比去年增产一百万斤。僮族农民和其他各族农民，为了进一步响应毛主席“增产节约”的号召，在秋收中创造了各种节约办法，改变了过去不注意稻谷在收获中的损耗现象，普遍做到了“颗粒还家”，“收好、打好、晒好、藏好”。如百色县大同乡僮、汉农民想出了各种积极办法，使每亩田里少损耗了一斤到二斤稻谷，全乡就多收了四千七百多斤。在丰收之后，僮族农民又团结各族兄弟积极响应政府号召，把余粮卖给国家，支援工业建设。如横县石井乡梁增成互助组三户僮族农民，在早稻丰收后，即卖了二千九百多斤余粮给国家。田阳县劳动模范黄昆，卖了一千斤谷、七百斤大米给国家，并准备再卖二千二百斤谷。各族农民热烈地缴纳爱国公粮，并保证自己交的公粮是 “一干二净三饱满”，交得快，不留尾欠。他们说：“公粮交给国家，还是为了自己，交的公粮坏，还是自己吃亏。”
    随着生产的发展，各族人民的生活也普遍提高了。今年自治区内的市场大大活跃起来，自治区贸易部门根据这一发展情况，在初级市场中设立的贸易机构比去年增加了百分之二十二，并普遍组织了流动购销组。据初步统计：贸易机构供应各族人民的农具、棉纱、煤油、工艺品等，平均比去年同期增加了一倍到三倍。桂西土特产丰富，素有“土产仓库”之称，贸易部门又增加了资金，大力收购自治区内的土特产。今年上半年收购黄糖、白糖、八角
  （即茴香）、药材、云耳、木耳、生猪等土特产所投放的资金即比去年同期增加了百分之二十二。土特产价格也合理地提高了。如在国民党统治时期，一斤八角只换到一斤多谷或四两盐，现在一斤八角能值十斤谷了。自治区内大宗出产的桐油、茶油，今年也有了销路。因此靠出卖土特产生活的少数民族人民的生活水平飞跃地提高了。自治区内已基本消除了“半年糠菜半年粮”的贫困状态。
    各族人民的物质生活提高后，对文化的要求也就更迫切。自治区人民政府为了适应这一需要，已在区内各县扩充和兴建了文化馆及收音站；增设了民族中学、民族师范学校和一般学校，并扩充了原有学校的设备。仅自治区所辖百色专区的完全小学和乡小学就发展到了三九○四所，学生增加到二六九、四七九人。如百色县一区第二完全小学学生比一九五○年增加了四倍。全百色专区平均每一个区有两所以上的完全小学，每一个乡有两所至三所乡小学；今年下半年在人民政府帮助下，全专区民族小学还增设了一百六十六班，民族小学教师也增至六千四百多人。大部分教师都学习了民族语言，并用民族语言授课。全专区的中等学校已增加到十三所，还有两个师范学校，中学和师范的学生共达六九三五人。自治区内今年培养、提拔了大批民族干部，有关专区都办了民族干部训练班。到目前为止民族干部训练班和广西民族学院培养出来的和正在培养的民族干部即达一三四三人。自治区内还重点建立了民族医院和扩充了各县卫生院，增设了卫生所；另外还组织巡回医疗队，下乡为各族人民治病。由于卫生工作的发展，现在已基本上制止了流行病的蔓延。自治区并培养了大批卫生工作干部，如百色专区即训练出各族卫生员六百人、接生员二百八十六人，专区医士学校并正训练着数百名卫生干部。
    桂西僮族自治区人民政府在进行各项工作中，都重视了自治区内其他少数民族的发展，特别注意解决其他少数民族的特殊困难。今年自治区人民政府为解决住在生产条件极差的山区的瑶、苗等少数民族的根本问题，进行了移民工作；在广西省人民政府的帮助下，将陆续把住在山区的二万多瑶、苗等族人民移住土地较多较好的僮、汉族地区，以进一步加强民族团结，发展生产。
    广西省僮族实行区域自治以来，在政治、经济、文化各方面的空前发展，除由于僮族人民自身的努力外，是与中央人民政府和上级人民政府对他们的关怀和帮助分不开的。广西省人民政府一向重视境内僮族和其他少数民族的发展，在领导各少数民族地区的生产、推行民族区域自治和培养民族干部等方面都作了很多的工作。最近中国共产党广西省委又召开了民族工作会议，总结了推行民族区域自治、培养民族干部等工作的经验，并研究了其他有关民族工作的问题。这对僮族自治区和广西省内的其他少数民族自治区进一步开展工作，是有很大帮助的。
    桂西僮族自治区一年来的成就，又有力地说明了毛主席的民族区域自治政策的正确和伟大。正如中央人民政府民族事务委员会第三次（扩大）会议“关于推行民族区域自治经验的基本总结”中所指出的，民族区域自治的推行，“增强了各民族人民的爱国主义、积极性和自动精神”，“加强了民族间和各民族内部的团结”，“密切了自治机关同人民之间的联系”，“逐渐促进了各少数民族政治、经济、文化的发展”。
