The Great Seven-Year Struggle of the Vietnamese People Against Aggression and for National Independence

　　In 1883, French imperialism occupied Vietnam and established a bloody colonial rule. At that time, prisons outnumbered schools, and prisoners outnumbered students; Vietnam exported more than one million tons of rice every year, while the Vietnamese people often suffered from hunger and famine. In order to get rid of their enslaved status, the Vietnamese people never ceased their struggle against French imperialism for decades. The anti-French struggles of Huang Hua Tan and Pan Tingfeng, both famous in history, lasted for more than ten years. After the birth of the Dongyang Communist Party in 1930, it led the Vietnamese people in fighting against French imperialism. From the Yian uprising in October 1930, the establishment of people's power, to the launch of guerrilla warfare during World War II, the Vietnamese people's struggle against imperialism developed more widely and deeply. By 1945, the Vietnamese people had won the victory of the "August Revolution," overthrown the colonial rule, and established the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In January 1946, they held a national general election and elected the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, headed by President Ho Chi Minh, which was unanimously supported by the people of the whole country.

　　However, French imperialists still attempted to restore their colonial rule over Vietnam. On September 23, 1945, they launched an armed offensive against southern Vietnam. In order to deceive public opinion and buy time to deploy military forces, they negotiated with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and signed the "March 6th Agreement" and the "September 14th Preliminary Agreement" in 1946. On December 19th of the same year, French imperialists perfidiously tore up these agreements and launched a full-scale military offensive against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Thereupon, the people of the whole of Vietnam were forced to take up arms and launch a great and heroic war of resistance against French imperialist aggression.

　　When the war began, French imperialists, relying on their superior equipment and numbers, clamored to "conquer Vietnam in three months"; but it took them more than three months just to occupy Hanoi. In October 1947, the French army launched a large-scale offensive against the Viet Bac liberated area, attempting to annihilate the main force of the Vietnamese People's Army and overthrow the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam; but the Vietnamese People's Army won a victory in the Luo River campaign, thwarting this arrogant attempt by the French army. In September 1950, the Vietnamese People's Army victoriously launched the border campaign, gaining the military initiative on the main battlefield. Subsequently, the Vietnamese People's Army won major victories in the four major campaigns of 1951, the Peaceful Campaign in late 1951 and early 1952, and the Northwest Campaign in the winter of 1952, further consolidating its military initiative on the main battlefield. Despite the fact that French and American imperialists formulated a "Navarre military plan" this year, attempting to reverse the passive situation, and launched the so-called "Seagull Campaign," "the most powerful offensive since the outbreak of the Indochina War," in October this year, they were defeated by the Vietnamese People's Army. Subsequently, the Vietnamese People's Army launched an offensive in the Northwest and liberated Lai Chau City, which had been occupied by the French army for seven years, once again thwarting the French imperialists' struggle to regain the military initiative.

　　On the enemy's rear battlefield, the Vietnamese people have extensively developed guerrilla warfare in the enemy's rear areas in the north, south, and central regions for several years. With the victory of the front battlefield, guerrilla warfare is also developing day by day. From July 1952 to July 1953 alone, the Vietnamese People's Armed Forces in the northern enemy's rear area wiped out more than 52,000 French and puppet troops and removed 162 large and small strongholds, increasing the area of ​​the guerrilla zone and guerrilla base on the left bank of the Red River from one-half of the total area of ​​the region to two-thirds.

　　Over the past seven years, the Vietnamese People's Army has grown stronger and stronger. When the war broke out, the Vietnamese People's Army had less than 10,000 people, with backward equipment and lack of combat experience; after seven years of arduous and heroic war training, it not only seized a large number of weapons from the enemy to gradually improve its equipment, but also greatly improved the political quality and combat effectiveness of the People's Army. Today, the Vietnamese People's Army has grown into a force of hundreds of thousands of people with a high degree of political consciousness, and a large number of brave and resourceful combat heroes have emerged. For example, Luo Wenqiu, a combat hero who had his right hand broken by the enemy in battle, still used his left hand to hold explosives and advance to complete the blasting task. There were 142 such heroes in the armed forces of Viet Bac alone before April 1952. Today, the Vietnamese People's Army has grown into a force capable of carrying out mobile warfare and siege battles, and capable of destroying the "indestructible" defense system boasted by French imperialists.

　　In the seven years of the war, the French imperialists' military strength has been weakened day by day. The loss of troops increased rapidly. Before the Border Campaign, the French army lost an average of 2,460 people per month. From the Northwest Campaign to November 20 this year, the average monthly loss increased to 6,132 people. The proportion of enemy soldiers who were tired of war and surrendered or were captured has increased even more. From the beginning of the Border Campaign to before the Peaceful Campaign, French and puppet troops who surrendered or were captured accounted for 21 percent of the number of people wiped out. During the Northwest Campaign, it increased to more than 40 percent. The enemy's reinforcements and supplementary troops could not keep up with the consumption on the battlefield, and their combat effectiveness was very poor.

　　In the seven years of the war, the Vietnamese People's Army has wiped out 320,026 French and puppet troops (as of November 20 this year), liberated most of the country and people, and gained and maintained military initiative on the main battlefield. The Vietnamese People's Army is growing stronger and stronger, and the French imperialists' military strength is weakening day by day. The balance of power is changing in favor of the Vietnamese people. Even former French Prime Minister Daladier had to admit: "In the end, we must leave this country."

(II)

　　The seven-year Vietnamese war has fully exposed the barbarity and injustice of the aggressive war waged by French imperialism, and proved the justice and progressiveness of the liberation war waged by the Vietnamese people.

　　French imperialists, believing that force could conquer the Vietnamese people, implemented the barbarous policy of "kill all, burn all, loot all." They even buried twenty-six old men alive in Deban Village, Henan Province, and threw the palms of three hundred Hongji coal miners into the sea. In some areas, more than 80 percent of women were raped. The enemy also implemented the policies of "merging villages" and "establishing no-man's lands." In He Dong, Tai Ping and other provinces, French troops burned down residents' houses and forced people to move to live near French strongholds. The enemy issued instructions such as "destroying the Viet Minh's crops is a basic military operation," put forward the slogan "killing a Vietnamese peasant is equal to killing a Vietnamese soldier," and blew up water conservancy projects, attempting to destroy the Vietnamese people's will to resist aggression.

　　In order to salvage military defeats, French imperialists also implemented the sinister conspiracy of "using war to support war, and using Vietnamese to fight Vietnamese," supporting Bao Dai, the emperor during the French and Japanese rule who fled to Hong Kong after the "August Revolution" and lived in dance halls, and organizing a puppet government that was actually completely controlled by French imperialists, and using this government to conscript soldiers on a large scale and plunder war expenses. In the puppet Bao Dai-controlled area, the current taxes are more than ten times higher than before the war; from 1947 to 1953, prices rose twelve times, while wages increased less than once; on average, one in five workers in the city is unemployed, and one in ten women is a prostitute.

　　In order to carry out this unjust war, French imperialists also drove tens of thousands of French youth to serve as cannon fodder, created a large number of orphans and widows in the country, and extorted three trillion francs in military expenses from the French people, increasing the national fiscal deficit, aggravating inflation, rapidly increasing prices, and gradually deteriorating the lives of the broad masses of the people. The number of unemployed and semi-unemployed people reached 3.1 million. However, the beneficiaries of the war were a very small number of French monopoly capitalists. According to official French figures, the profits earned by 45 French companies in Indochina in 1951 increased by 18.6 times compared with 1946. United Press reporter Hobrecht reported: "The profits that French capitalists get from Indochina are actually more than the military expenses spent by the French government there." This is the sinister face of French imperialist aggressive war.

　　The Vietnamese people are waging a war of resistance against French imperialist aggression in order to defend their national independence and freedom. Over the past eight years since the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, various social reforms have been continuously carried out in the difficult environment of the war; the free and happy life of the people in the liberated areas and the painful life of the people in the French-occupied areas form a sharp contrast. The Vietnamese people are deeply aware that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is a truly independent government and a government of the Vietnamese people themselves. It gives the Vietnamese people the political rights to elect, remove, supervise and criticize officials. In rural areas, poor and hired peasants, middle peasants and other working people who account for 80 to 90 percent of the population control the rural political power. At the same time, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is constantly improving the economic and cultural living standards of the people under the conditions permitted by the war. In the past few years, it has distributed more than 300,000 hectares of land seized by French imperialists and Vietnamese traitors to farmers without or with little land. This year, it launched the masses to reduce rent and return rent and prepare to implement land reform, improving the lives of farmers and making many poor and hired peasants rise to middle peasants. This year, for the first time, it achieved a balance of fiscal revenue and expenditure, gradually stabilized finance and prices, and developed agricultural and industrial production. The government decided to increase in-kind subsidies for workers and cadres, improving the lives of workers and cadres. Illiteracy has been basically eliminated in the liberated areas. During the period of French imperialist rule, the number of primary school students in the country was 165,000, but by the end of 1952, it had increased to 432,000 (excluding the south). Unemployment has been basically eliminated in the liberated areas.

　　The Democratic Republic of Vietnam is a symbol of the independence and freedom of the Vietnamese people. The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam under the leadership of President Ho Chi Minh has won the enthusiastic support of the Vietnamese people.

(III)

　　The just struggle of the Vietnamese people has been supported by peace-loving people all over the world from the very beginning. Especially after the Soviet Union, China, and various people's democratic countries established diplomatic relations with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, this just support has become increasingly widespread. In various conferences such as the World People's Peace Congress, the Asian and Pacific Region Peace Conference, the World Federation of Trade Unions, the World Federation of Women, and the World Federation of Youth, as well as all just public opinion in the world, they have expressed unlimited sympathy and support for the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people, and expressed deep hatred for French and American imperialism. This year, the Third Congress of the World Federation of Trade Unions decided that December 19 will be the "International Day of Active Support for the Vietnamese People and the Struggle to Stop the Colonial War in Vietnam," calling on the working class and working people all over the world to support the just struggle of the Vietnamese people and stop the French and American imperialist aggression against Vietnam.

　　Under the leadership of the French Communist Party, the French people actively launched the "End the Dirty War" movement to support the Vietnamese people. Henri Martin, who launched the movement against the war of aggression against Vietnam in the French Navy in 1950, and Raymond Dayan, who lay on the train tracks to prevent troops from going to Vietnam, have become the banner of the French people against the war of aggression against Vietnam. On June 21 this year, the masses in 36 provinces of France simultaneously held demonstrations, shouting the slogan "End the Vietnam War," marking that the movement of the French people against the war of aggression against Vietnam is becoming more and more extensive and has become an irresistible force.

　　The French people's movement against the war of aggression against Vietnam has affected the ranks of the French bourgeoisie. Some bourgeois elements in France have felt that there is no guarantee of victory in the war in Vietnam, and that this war has weakened France's military strength in its homeland and endangered France's position in Western Europe. Another result is that the United States is squeezing France out of Vietnam. Therefore, in the French parliament in 1948, there were only five non-Communist members who voted against the Vietnam War. When the French parliament debated the Vietnam issue at the end of October this year, the number of non-Communist members who voted against the Vietnam War increased to 151.

　　The current French government's policy of continuing to expand the Vietnam War is the result of pressure from the United States. Everyone knows that without the support and intervention of the United States, France would not be able to continue the Vietnam War. This year, more than 40 percent of France's military spending in Indochina comes from U.S. "aid." The U.S. military delegation to Indochina is helping France formulate combat plans and expand the Bao Dai puppet army. American imperialism attempts to use this to maintain the tense situation in the Far East, continue to implement its military plan to invade the world, and further replace France in controlling Indochina.

　　Recently, President Ho Chi Minh, in answering a question from a reporter from the Swedish "Expressen" on the peaceful settlement of the Vietnam issue, stated that if "the French government truly respects the independence of Vietnam," "a ceasefire in Vietnam can be achieved"; and pointed out: "If the French colonialists continue their war of aggression against Vietnam, the Vietnamese people are determined to carry out their patriotic struggle to the final victory." This speech has won the support of people all over the world and has thrown the French government into chaos. U.S. President Eisenhower hurriedly put great pressure on the French government at the Bermuda Conference to prevent it from holding ceasefire negotiations with the Vietnamese people, and guaranteed that the United States would continue to fully support the French troops fighting in Indochina. As a result, French Foreign Minister Bidault expressed "France's determination to fight in Indochina." However, due to the strength of the Vietnamese people and the active support of people all over the world, the conspiracy of French and American imperialism to continue to expand this war of aggression will definitely be met with a shameful defeat.

    越南人民七年来反抗侵略争取民族独立的伟大斗争
    黄德
    （一）
    一八八三年法帝国主义侵占了越南，建立了血腥的殖民地统治。那时，监狱比学校多，囚犯比学生多；越南每年有一百多万吨大米输出，而越南人民却常常遭受饥饿与灾荒的威胁。越南人民为了要摆脱被奴役的地位，几十年来没有停止过反抗法帝国主义的斗争。历史上有名的黄花探与潘庭逢的反法斗争，都坚持了十多年之久。一九三○年东洋共产党诞生之后，就一直领导越南人民与法帝国主义作斗争。从一九三○年十月的宜安起义、建立人民政权，到第二次世界大战时期的发动游击战争，越南人民反对帝国主义的斗争日益广泛而深入地发展。到了一九四五年，越南人民取得了“八月革命”的胜利，推翻了殖民地的统治，建立了越南民主共和国，并于一九四六年一月举行全国普选，选出了为全国人民一致拥护的、以胡志明主席为首的越南民主共和国政府。
    但是，法帝国主义者仍图恢复对越南的殖民地统治，它于一九四五年九月二十三日开始向越南南部实行武装进攻。为了欺骗舆论，争取时间部署军事力量，它又与越南民主共和国政府进行谈判，且于一九四六年签订了“三·六协定”和“九·一四初步协定”。到了同年十二月十九日，法帝国主义者便背信弃义地撕毁了这些协定，向越南民主共和国发动全面的军事进攻。于是，越南全国人民被迫拿起武器来，展开了英勇的反抗法帝国主义侵略的伟大战争。
    当战争开始时，法帝国主义者恃其军队的装备与数量的优势，叫嚣着要在“三个月内征服越南”；但仅仅攻占河内一城，就花了三个多月。一九四七年十月，法军大举进攻越北解放区，企图歼灭越南人民军的主力，推翻越南民主共和国政府；但越南人民军在罗江战役中获得胜利，粉碎了法军这个狂妄的企图。一九五○年九月，越南人民军胜利地发动了边界战役，取得了主要战场的军事主动权。接着，一九五一年的四大战役、一九五一年底与一九五二年初的和平战役、一九五二年冬的西北战役，越南人民军都获得重大的胜利，更巩固了主要战场的军事主动权。尽管今年法、美帝国主义者拟订了一个“纳瓦尔军事计划”，企图挽回被动挨打的形势，并于今年十月发动所谓“自从印度支那战争爆发以来最强大的一次攻势”的“海鸥战役”，结果却被越南人民军所击溃。接着，越南人民军在西北发动攻势，并解放了七年来为法军所盘据的莱州省城，再一次粉碎了法帝国主义者企图夺回军事主动权的挣扎。
    在敌后战场上，几年来越南人民在北部、南部、中部的敌后地区广泛地发展了游击战争。随着正面战场的胜利，游击战争也日益发展。仅自一九五二年七月至一九五三年七月，北部敌后越南人民武装就歼灭了法军及伪军五万二千余名，拔除了大小据点一百六十二个，使红河左岸地区的游击区和游击根据地的面积，由该区总面积的一半增加到三分之二。
    七年来，越南人民军日益壮大了。当战争爆发时，越南人民军不到一万人，且装备落后，战斗经验缺乏；经过七年艰苦而英勇的战争的锻炼，不仅从敌人手中夺得大批武器来逐步改善了自己的装备，而且大大地提高了人民军的政治素质与战斗力。到今天，越南人民军已成长为一支有高度政治觉悟的数十万人的队伍，涌现了大批勇敢、机智的战斗英雄。如在战斗中被敌人打断了右手，仍用左手抱炸药前进完成爆破任务的战斗英雄罗文求等。这样的英雄人物仅在一九五二年四月以前的越北武装队伍中，就有一百四十二个。今天越南人民军成长为能够进行运动战与攻坚战斗的力量，能够摧毁法帝国主义者吹嘘的“牢不可破”的防御系统。
    七年的战争中，法帝国主义的军事力量则日益削弱了。军队的损失迅速增加。边界战役以前，法军平均每月损失二千四百六十人，从西北战役到今年十一月二十日，平均每月损失增至六千一百三十二人。敌方士兵厌战投降或被俘比例更加增长。自边界战役开始到和平战役前，法军及伪军投降或被俘者占被歼人数的百分之二十一，在西北战役期间增至百分之四十以上。敌军增援、补充的军队赶不上战场上的消耗，且战斗力很差。
    在七年的战争中，越南人民军已歼灭了法军和伪军三十二万零二十六名（至今年十一月二十日止），解放了大部分国土与人民，取得并保持了主要战场的军事主动权。越南人民军在日益壮大，法帝国主义的军事力量在日益削弱，力量的对比在向有利于越南人民方面变化中。这就证明了最后胜利必属于越南人民。法国前总理达拉第也不能不承认：“到最后，我们必须离开这个国家。”
    （二）
    七年来的越南战争，充分揭露了法帝国主义进行的侵略战争的野蛮性和非正义性，证明了越南人民进行的解放战争的正义性和进步性。
    法帝国主义者迷信武力可以征服越南人民，实行了“杀光、烧光、抢光”的野蛮政策。他们甚至在河南省德板村把二十六个老人活埋，把三百个鸿基煤矿工人的手掌串起来抛到海里去，在有些地区把百分之八十以上的妇女都奸污。敌人又实行了“并村”、“建立无人地带”的政策。在河东、太平等省，法军把居民的屋宇烧毁，强迫人民搬到法军据点附近居住。敌人发出“破坏越盟的庄稼是一个基本的军事行动”的指示，提出“杀一个越南农民等于杀一个越南士兵”的口号，并炸坏水利工程等，企图摧毁越南人民反抗侵略的意志。
    为了挽救军事上的失败，法帝国主义者又实行了“以战养战、用越南人打越南人”的恶毒阴谋，扶植法国及日本统治时代的皇帝、“八月革命”后逃到香港去在舞场中过活的保大，组织实际上完全受法帝国主义控制的傀儡政府，并通过这个政府来大规模地抓壮丁充炮灰、搜刮战费。在傀儡保大统治区，现在的捐税比战前增加了十多倍；自一九四七年到一九五三年，物价高涨了十二倍，而工资增加不到一倍；城市中平均五个工人即有一个失业，平均十个妇女即有一个娼妓。
    法帝国主义者为进行这个不义的战争，还驱使成千成万的法国青年充当炮灰，在国内制造了大量孤儿、寡妇；从法国人民身上搜刮了三万亿法郎的军费，使国家财政赤字增加，通货膨胀加剧，物价迅速上涨，广大人民生活日趋恶化，失业和半失业者达三百一十万。而在战争中获得利益的却是法国的极少数独占资本家，据法国官方公布，印度支那的四十五家法国公司在一九五一年所得的利润和一九四六年比较，增加了一八·六倍。合众社记者霍布雷奇德报道：“法国资本家从印度支那获得的利润，实际上比法国政府在那里作战所花的军费还要多。”这就是法帝国主义侵略战争的罪恶面目。
    越南人民是为了保卫自己的民族独立、自由，而进行反抗法帝国主义侵略的战争。越南民主共和国成立八年多来在战争的艰苦环境中，仍不断进行各种社会改革；解放区人民的自由幸福生活和法占区人民的痛苦生活形成鲜明的对比。越南人民深刻地认识到，越南民主共和国政府是真正的独立政府，是越南人民自己的政府。它把选举、罢免官员、监督和批评政府的政治权利给予越南人民。在农村，占人口百分之八十至九十的贫雇农、中农和其他劳动人民掌握了乡村的政权。同时，越南民主共和国政府在战争所容许的条件下，不断地提高人民的经济和文化生活水平。几年来，它已把三十万公顷以上的法帝国主义和越奸霸占的土地分给无地或少地的农民，今年又发动群众减租退租、准备实行土地改革，改善了农民的生活，使许多贫雇农上升为中农。今年第一次达到了财政收支平衡、金融物价逐步稳定，农业、工业生产有了发展，政府便决定增加工人与干部的实物津贴，改善了工人与干部的生活。在解放区，文盲基本上已肃清。法帝国主义统治时期全国小学生人数为一十六万五千人，一九五二年底则已增加到四十三万二千人（南部未计算在内）。在解放区内，基本上消灭了失业现象。
    越南民主共和国是越南人民独立、自由的标志。在胡志明主席领导下的越南民主共和国政府获得了越南人民的热烈拥护。
    （三）
    越南人民的正义斗争一开始就得到全世界爱好和平人民的支援，特别是苏联、中国和各人民民主国家与越南民主共和国建立邦交之后，这种正义的支持愈来愈广泛。在世界人民和平大会、亚洲及太平洋区域和平会议、世界工联、世界妇联、世界青联等各次会议中以及世界一切正义的舆论，都对越南人民的英勇斗争表示无限同情与支持，对法、美帝国主义表示深刻的憎恨。今年，世界工联第三次代表大会决定十二月十九日为“国际积极支援越南人民日与争取停止越南殖民战争斗争日”，号召全世界工人阶级与劳动人民支援越南人民的正义斗争，制止法、美帝国主义侵略越南的行为。
    法国人民在法国共产党的领导下，积极展开“结束肮脏的战争”运动来支援越南人民。一九五○年在法国海军中展开反对侵略越南战争运动的亨利·马丁、卧在火车轨道上阻止军队开赴越南的雷蒙达·第安，已成为法国人民反对侵略越南战争的旗帜。今年六月二十一日，法国三十六个省的群众同时举行示威游行，高呼“结束越南战争”的口号，标志着法国人民反对进行侵越战争的运动愈来愈扩大，已成为不可抗拒的力量。
    法国人民的反对侵略越南战争的运动已影响到法国资产阶级的队伍。法国的一部分资产阶级分子已感到对越南战争毫无胜利的把握，且这个战争削弱了法国在本土的兵力，危害了法国在西欧的地位，而另一结果则是美国把法国排挤出越南。所以在一九四八年的法国国会中，投票反对越南战争的非共产党议员只有五个，今年十月底法国国会辩论越南问题时，投票反对越南战争的非共产党议员增加到一百五十一名。
    目前法国政府继续扩大越南战争的政策，是受到美国压力的结果。谁都知道，没有美国的支援与干涉，法国就不可能继续进行越南战争。今年法国在印度支那的军费，百分之四十以上来自美“援”。美国的驻印度支那军事代表团帮助着法国拟订作战计划，扩充保大伪军。美帝国主义企图借此以维持远东的紧张局势，继续执行其侵略世界的军事计划，并进一步代替法国控制印度支那。
    最近胡志明主席就和平协商解决越南问题答复瑞典“快报”记者时曾表示：如果“法国政府真正尊重越南的独立”，“越南停战便可实现”；并指出：“假如法国殖民主义者继续其侵略越南的战争，越南人民是有决心将自己的爱国斗争进行到最后胜利的。”这个谈话获得全世界人民的拥护，使法国政府内部陷于混乱。美国总统艾森豪威尔慌忙在百慕大会议中向法国政府大施压力，以阻止它和越南人民进行停战谈判，并保证美国将继续全力支持在印度支那作战的法国军队，于是法国外交部部长皮杜尔便表示“法国要在印度支那作战的决心”。但是由于越南人民力量强大，并获得全世界人民的积极支持，所以法、美帝国主义企图继续扩大这一侵略战争的阴谋，肯定是会遭到可耻的失败的。
