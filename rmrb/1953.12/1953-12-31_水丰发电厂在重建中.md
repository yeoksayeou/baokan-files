Xinhua News Agency Dispatch from Korea:

    The huge Sup'ung Dam hydroelectric plant on the Yalu River presents a renewed appearance. The towering, gray-white dam stands majestically, with rushing torrents surging in front of the power plant, and countless high-voltage power lines forming a dense web in the sky above. All the plant's staff are working intensely on projects like restoring the plant buildings, welcoming the large-scale reconstruction effort.
    The Sup'ung Dam hydroelectric plant is one of the sources of happiness for the Korean people. The electricity generated here can supply many factories and cities throughout the country. It keeps the machines turning in many factories across the country, constantly producing necessities for the people's lives; it lights the lamps and warms the electric stoves in many cities across the country. However, during the Korean War, American imperialism actually treated such a peaceful facility as a "military target" and bombed it barbarously. Parts of the plant buildings were damaged, and the dam was riddled with bullet marks. American imperialism was confident that such barbaric bombing would stop this huge power plant from generating electricity, thereby creating serious difficulties for the lives and struggles of the Korean people. However, the strong will of the Korean people, especially the Korean workers, cannot be conquered by any aggressor. The workers of the Sup'ung Dam hydroelectric plant used tenacious labor and astonishing wisdom to move several huge transformers into mountain caves, continuing to transmit electricity to various parts of Korea.
    Since the armistice, cities and villages in the northern half of the Republic have begun a vigorous recovery work everywhere, and the recovery work of the Sup'ung Dam hydroelectric plant is at the forefront. The workers know the significant role of restoring the power plant in developing the people's economy and improving the people's lives, and put forward the resounding slogan: "Don't waste a minute or a second, strive to fully restore the power plant as soon as possible!"
    The publication of the Sino-Soviet and Sino-Korean communiqués has further greatly encouraged the workers' enthusiasm for labor. According to the Sino-Soviet communiqué, this power plant is one of the key projects of Soviet assistance to Korea for reconstruction. Soon, a group of Soviet experts will come to the plant to assist in the reconstruction work, and a large number of Soviet-aided machines will also be shipped in continuously.
    At present, all the staff of the Sup'ung Dam hydroelectric plant are working hard. The beam erectors quickly climbed onto the roof frame, started the hoist, and suspended the huge roof beams; the movers kept moving the rubble and waste soil out of the plant buildings, and carried various building materials into the plant buildings; the line erectors climbed on the towering iron towers to sort out the transmission lines; the electrical repair workers were busy collecting various parts and repairing complex machines...
    In order to accelerate the recovery of this project, every employee of the power plant has used his wisdom to find many tricks and put forward a large number of rationalization proposals. In the work of repairing a huge part on a certain generator, Chi Zongchun, the head of the electrical repair section, alone created more than ten kinds of tools, which saved more than eight hundred man-hours of repair work and completed the repair plan thirty-eight days ahead of schedule.
    In the arduous work of restoring the Sup'ung Dam hydroelectric plant, the female workers also made significant contributions. Thirty-five percent of the workers doing heavy work in the whole plant are female workers. They are all very young, and many of them came to work in the power plant just after graduating from primary and secondary schools; they demanded to take on more arduous work and contribute more to the country's construction. Like the male workers, they carry mud and wood, and their labor efficiency is sometimes higher than that of the male workers. I visited a young female worker, Kim Gwi-nyeo, who is a labor party member and serves as the leader of a workers' team. She took the lead actively in every work she did, never fell behind others, and overfulfilled the work tasks. She also put forward a rationalization proposal to change the railway for transporting mud from a single track to a double track, which greatly improved the labor efficiency. She said: If we completely restore our power plant, we can enable the factories to produce more things, and we will have everything we need. If we work harder today, our lives will be as good as those in the Soviet Union tomorrow.
    Driven by the desire to build a better life for the people of the country, the workers are making rapid progress in various projects. Now, a huge transformer has been moved back to its original location from the cave. It took a total of 1,700 man-hours and 68 hours to move this transformer into the cave during the war; this time, after the workers' research and improvement of the method, it took only 696 man-hours and 48 hours to move it. The arduous roof beam erection project has also been completed, and the workers are now busy laying the roof. In addition, the workers also repaired a large crane. The repair of this crane created more favorable conditions for the future repair of a certain generator.
    In order to accelerate the recovery project and ensure the quality of the project, the technical personnel and workers of the Sup'ung Dam hydroelectric plant are adopting and studying the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. In the recovery of the plant building project, Li Wanzhu, a civil engineering technician who had just returned from studying in the Soviet Union not long ago, adopted the Soviet advanced construction method and designed a drawing of a plant building beam. It is the first time in Korea to use this kind of beam for building a plant building, which can save a lot of iron and has good quality. After the beam was approved by the Electrical Bureau of the Cabinet and manufactured according to this design, another problem was encountered: how to suspend such a beam, which is more than 20 meters long and weighs more than 20 tons, to the roof? Kang Zonggen, the leader of the team who won the medal for transporting transformers using Soviet experience during the war, designed a method of suspending the beam with two frames based on the method introduced by the Soviet pictorial. When the first beam was suspended, three professors of architecture from the Korean Academy of Sciences who came to visit the power plant expressed their admiration for the great achievements made by the workers in adopting Soviet experience.
    While restoring the power plant, all the staff members and workers of the plant, in addition to completing their own work, also spend one hour every day on "patriotic labor" and built 90 new staff and worker residences in 20 days. Many staff members and workers' families have moved into their new homes.
    Now, the workers of the Sup'ung Dam hydroelectric plant are engaged in a heated labor competition, working selflessly to restore the work; on the one hand, they are preparing to welcome the upcoming Soviet experts. The Korean people love labor, love peaceful construction, and desire a better life. With the assistance of the Soviet Union, China, and various people's democratic countries, they will certainly be able to heal the wounds of war quickly.

    水丰发电厂在重建中
    新华社记者  袁光强
    鸭绿江上巨大的水丰发电厂，呈现着新生的气象。灰白色的大水坝巍峨地屹立着，滚滚的急流在厂房前面汹涌着，无数根高压电线在发电厂上空织成了密密的网。发电厂的全体职工，正在紧张地进行着恢复厂房等工程，迎接着规模宏大的重建事业。
    水丰发电厂是朝鲜人民的幸福源泉之一。从这里发出的电，可供应全国的许多工厂和城市。它使全国许多工厂的机器转动，不断地生产出人民生活必需品；它使全国许多城市的电灯明亮，电炉发热。但是，美帝国主义在侵朝战争期间，竟把这样一个和平设备当做“军事目标”加以野蛮地轰炸。发电厂的部分厂房被炸坏了，水坝上也是弹痕累累。美帝国主义满以为这样野蛮轰炸，就可以使这个巨大的发电厂停止发电，从而给朝鲜人民的生活和斗争造成严重困难。但是，朝鲜人民、特别是朝鲜工人的坚强意志是任何侵略者都不能征服的。水丰发电厂的工人用顽强的劳动和惊人的智慧，把几台巨大的变压器搬进了山洞，继续向朝鲜各地输送电力。
    停战以后，共和国北半部的城市和农村，到处都开始展开了蓬勃的恢复工作，水丰发电厂的恢复工作走在最前面。工人们知道恢复发电厂对发展人民经济和改善人民生活的重大作用，提出了响亮的口号：“不浪费一分一秒时间，为争取早日全部恢复发电厂而奋斗！”
    苏朝会谈公报和中朝会谈公报的发表，更大大地鼓舞了工人们的劳动热情。根据苏朝会谈公报，这座发电厂是苏联帮助朝鲜进行恢复建设的重点之一。不久，一批苏联专家就要到厂里来协助进行重建工作，苏联援助的大批机器也将随着源源运来。
    现在，水丰发电厂的全体职工正在紧张地劳动着。架梁工人迅速地攀登到房架上，开动起卷扬机，把巨大的房梁悬吊上去；搬运工人不停地把厂房里的碎石废土搬运出去，又把各种建筑器材搬运到厂房里来；架线工人攀登在高耸的铁塔上整理着送电线；电气补修工人忙着搜集各种零件，修理复杂的机器……。
    为了加速这一工程的恢复，发电厂每个职工都发挥了自己的智慧，找出了许多窍门，提出了大量合理化建议。在修理某发电机上的一个巨大机件的工作中，电气补修课课长池宗淳独自就创造了十多种工具，使修复工作节省了八百多个人工，并提前三十八天完成了修复计划。
    在恢复水丰发电厂的艰巨工作中，女工们也作出了重大的贡献。全厂干重活的工人中有百分之三十五是女工。她们都很年轻，许多刚从小学和中学毕业就来发电厂工作；她们要求担任更繁重的工作，对祖国的建设事业贡献得更多些。她们和男工们一样地搬运泥土和木材，她们的劳动效率有时比男工还高。我访问了一个青年女工金贵女，她是劳动党员，担任一个工人小组的小组长。她在进行每一件工作时，都积极带头，从来没有落在别人的后面，并且超额完成工作任务。她并提出了一项合理化建议，把搬运泥土用的铁轨由单轨改成双轨，这样就大大提高了劳动效率。她说：把我们发电厂完全恢复了，就可以使各工厂生产出更多的东西，要什么有什么。今天我们加把油，明天我们的生活就会像苏联一样的美好。
    为全国人民建设美好生活的愿望推动着的工人们，使各项工程都在迅速地进展着。现在，有一台巨大的变压器已经从山洞里搬回到原处。在战时往山洞里搬运这台变压器时，共费一千七百个人工、六十八个小时才搬运停当；这次，经工人们研究，改进了方法，只费六百九十六个人工，四十八个小时就搬运停当了。艰巨的厂房架梁工程也已完工，现在，工人们正紧张地铺盖着房顶。此外，工人们还修好了一部大起重机。修好这部起重机，为将来修复某号发电机创造了更便利的条件。
    为了加速恢复工程和保证工程质量，水丰发电厂的技术人员和工人们正在采用和研究苏联的先进经验。在恢复厂房工程中，不久以前才从苏联留学回来的土木技师李完洙，采用苏联的先进建筑法，设计了一种厂房大梁的图样。建筑厂房使用这种房梁在朝鲜来说还是第一次，这可节省大量铁材，质量也好。经内阁电气局批准并根据这个设计制好了大梁后，又碰到了一个问题：像这样一个长达二十多公尺，重有二十多吨的大梁，怎样把它悬吊到房顶上去呢？在战时采用苏联经验搬运变压器而荣获奖章的小组长康宗根，又根据苏联画报介绍的办法，设计出用两个架子来悬吊大梁的办法。当第一根大梁悬吊上去的时候，来发电厂参观的朝鲜科学院的三位建筑学的教授，对工人们采用苏联经验所获得的巨大成就表示钦佩。
    在恢复发电厂的同时，全厂职工除了完成自己的工作外，又每天抽出一小时的时间进行“爱国劳动”，在二十天内新建了九十户的职工住宅。许多职工家属已迁入新居了。
    现在，水丰发电厂的工人们，一面在展开热烈的劳动竞赛，忘我地进行恢复工作；一面在准备着欢迎即将到来的苏联专家。朝鲜人民是热爱劳动、热爱和平建设和渴望美好生活的，在苏联、中国及各人民民主国家的援助下，他们一定能够很快地医治好战争的创伤。
