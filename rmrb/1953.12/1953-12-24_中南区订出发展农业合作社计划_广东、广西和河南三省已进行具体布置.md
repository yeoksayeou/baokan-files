    Central-South Region Formulates Agricultural Cooperative Development Plan
    Guangdong, Guangxi, and Henan Provinces Have Made Specific Arrangements

      [Our Newspaper News] The CCP Central Committee's Central-South Bureau has formulated a plan for developing agricultural production cooperatives throughout the region this winter and next spring. At the same time, it has made general arrangements for the development of mutual aid teams in the region next year. Guangdong, Guangxi, and Henan provinces have also made specific arrangements for the development of mutual aid and cooperative organizations.

    After two or three years of mutual aid and cooperation movements in the Central-South Region, more than 11 million peasant households have participated in mutual aid and cooperative organizations, accounting for more than 30 percent of the total number of agricultural households in the region. There are now 929 agricultural production cooperatives in the region (including those recently approved) and 225,000 permanent mutual aid teams.

    According to the experience of various regions, the development of mutual aid and cooperation movements is faster in areas where agricultural production cooperatives are well-run. For example, the Yang Yunxing Agricultural Production Cooperative, which was established on a trial basis in Gushimiao Township, Nanle County, Henan Province, in February of last year, had an average yield per mu that was 52 percent higher than that of ordinary farmers during the autumn harvest. This allowed many mutual aid teams and individual farmers to see the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives, and they actively demanded to establish cooperatives and participate in mutual aid teams. Now Gushimiao Township has nine agricultural production cooperatives, thirty-five permanent mutual aid teams, and fifty-seven temporary mutual aid teams. The number of peasant households organized in the township has accounted for more than 79 percent of the total number of agricultural households in the township. Recently, in studying the general line for the state's transition period, farmers in various regions have further realized the benefits of implementing the socialist transformation of agriculture, and the number of people requesting to establish agricultural production cooperatives and participate in mutual aid teams is increasing day by day. After studying the general line, district and township cadres and peasant activists in Xiuwu County, Henan Province, automatically wanted to set up 81 agricultural production cooperatives throughout the county.

    In order to meet the demands of farmers in the entire region, the CCP Central Committee's Central-South Bureau plans that by next year, the number of peasant households participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations will reach 50 percent of the total number of agricultural households in the region. Before the spring plowing next year, the number of agricultural production cooperatives will increase to 3,325. The number of permanent mutual aid teams will increase to more than 787,000 next year, and a large number of temporary mutual aid teams will also be developed.

    The plan of the CCP Central Committee's Central-South Bureau was put forward to various regions based on the different conditions of each region. The pilot program for agricultural production cooperatives proposed that the number of pilot programs required in the northern Henan area and the areas south of the Yellow River in Henan Province, where land reform was completed earlier or where experience in running agricultural production cooperatives has been gained, should be larger. For example, Anyang and Xinxiang prefectures will each develop from the original 160 agricultural production cooperatives to 450 to 550 this winter and next spring. Counties with a good foundation for mutual aid and cooperation and have already piloted one or two agricultural production cooperatives should develop five or six more. General counties will pilot one to three. Counties that are not yet suitable for running agricultural production cooperatives should further strengthen their leadership over the mutual aid and cooperation movement to create conditions for the active establishment of agricultural production cooperatives. In addition, the suburban rural areas of Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other large and medium-sized cities should also focus on piloting a number of agricultural or horticultural production cooperatives.

    At present, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Henan provinces in the Central-South Region have made specific arrangements for the development of mutual aid and cooperative organizations. The CCP Central Committee's South China Sub-Bureau held a mutual aid and cooperation conference and formulated a plan for Guangdong to pilot agricultural production cooperatives this winter and next spring: more than 160 agricultural production cooperatives will be piloted in 75 counties, with one to several pilot programs in each county. The target put forward by the Second Congress of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China is: to establish 175 agricultural production cooperatives in qualified counties this winter and next spring, and the organization coverage of permanent mutual aid groups is required to reach 8 percent of the total number of households in the province, and the temporary and seasonal mutual aid groups reach 32 percent of the total number of households. The mutual aid and cooperation conference held by the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China unanimously agreed with the plan put forward by the Henan Provincial Committee: the province will develop from the existing 852 agricultural production cooperatives to 2,500 by the autumn harvest next year, and the number of farmers participating in mutual aid and cooperative organizations will increase from the current 40+ percent to 65 percent. At present, the provinces have arranged the work of running agricultural production cooperatives to the county level, and the training of cadres will generally begin in various places this month.

### 中南区订出发展农业合作社计划  广东、广西和河南三省已进行具体布置

    中南区订出发展农业合作社计划
    广东、广西和河南三省已进行具体布置
      【本报讯】中共中央中南局已订出今冬明春全区发展农业生产合作社的计划，同时对明年全区互助组的发展工作也作了大体安排。广东、广西、河南三省也分别作了发展互助合作组织的具体布置。
    中南区经过两三年互助合作运动的开展，全区参加互助合作组织的农户已达一千一百多万户，占全区农业户数的百分之三十强；现在全区共有农业生产合作社九百二十九个（包括最近批准的在内），常年性互助组二十二万五千个。
    根据各地的经验，凡是农业生产合作社办得好的地区，互助合作运动的发展就比较快。如河南省南乐县古寺庙乡在去年二月试办的杨运兴农业生产合作社，秋收时每亩平均产量比一般农民的产量高出百分之五十二，使许多互助组和单干农民看到了农业生产合作社的优越性，他们积极要求建社和参加互助组。现在古寺庙乡已经有九个农业生产合作社、三十五个常年性互助组和五十七个临时性互助组。全乡组织起来的农户已占全乡农业总户数的百分之七十九强。最近各地农民在学习国家过渡时期的总路线中，更进一步认识了实行农业社会主义改造的好处，要求建立农业生产合作社和参加互助组的日益增多。河南省修武县区、乡干部和农民积极分子学习总路线后，全县自动要办的农业生产合作社就有八十一个。
    中共中央中南局为适应全区农民的要求，计划明年全区参加互助合作组织的农户，要达到占全区农业总户数的百分之五十。在明年春耕前，农业生产合作社要增加到三千三百二十五个。常年性互助组在明年要增加到七十八万七千多个，另外还要大量发展临时性互助组。
    中共中央中南局的这个计划，是根据各个地区的不同条件分别向各地提出的。关于农业生产合作社的试办计划中提出：河南省的豫北地区和黄河以南完成土地改革较早或者已取得办农业生产合作社经验的地区，要求试办的数量较多。如安阳和新乡两个专区在今冬明春要各由原有的一百六十个农业生产合作社，发展到四百五十到五百五十个。互助合作运动基础较好并且已经试办过一、二个农业生产合作社的县，要再发展五六个。一般的县试办一个到三个。目前还不宜办农业生产合作社的县，要进一步加强对互助合作运动的领导，为积极建立农业生产合作社创造条件。此外，武汉、广州两市和其他大中城市的郊区农村，也要重点试办若干的农业或园艺生产合作社。
    现在，中南区广东、广西、河南三省已分别作了发展互助合作组织的具体布置。中共中央华南分局召开了互助合作会议，拟定了今冬明春广东试办农业生产合作社的计划：在七十五个县试办农业生产合作社一百六十多个，每县试办一个至数个不等。中共广西省第二次代表会议提出的指标是：今冬明春在有条件的县建立一百七十五个农业生产合作社，常年互助组的组织面要求达到全省总户数的百分之八，临时、季节性互助组达到总户数的百分之三十二。中共河南省委会召开的互助合作会议，一致同意河南省委提出的计划：全省到明年秋收前，在现有八百五十二个农业生产合作社的基础上发展到两千五百个，参加互助合作组织的农户由现在的百分之四十多增加到百分之六十五。现在，各省已把办农业生产合作社的工作布置到县，本月内各地就将普遍开始训练干部。
