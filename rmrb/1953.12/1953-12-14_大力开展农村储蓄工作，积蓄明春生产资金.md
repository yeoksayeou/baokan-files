    After enthusiastically publicizing the General Line to farmers in various regions, the farmers' understanding has improved. For the sake of the country's socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture, they have sold their surplus grain to the state, even selling grain they had stored for years, vividly demonstrating the farmers' spirit of patriotism. However, we must clearly recognize that mobilizing farmers to sell surplus grain is only part of our work. Another important task is to help farmers make reasonable arrangements for the proceeds from grain sales, in order to accumulate funds for next year's production and expand production next year. This work is also very important and very arduous.

    In the past, farmers stored their surplus grain themselves and sold it gradually according to the needs of the production season, naturally arranging for the year's production and life. The society's means of production and means of subsistence were also adapted to this seasonal need for production, and were supplied to the market in timely installments. This year is different from previous years. Farmers will sell their grain in a concentrated, large-scale way in a short period of time. This is of course beneficial to the farmers and the country, and is necessary. However, because the law of grain sales has changed, while the seasonal law of rural production has not changed, and the law of social material production and supply has not changed, a contradiction has arisen. Farmers have sold their grain and have a large sum of cash in hand. Some of them do not need the money right now, and some have not spent it because the supply and transportation of rural materials is insufficient. Therefore, how should this large sum of money be arranged? How can the proceeds of a year's hard work be used in the most useful place, in the most economical way, without loss or waste? This is a major concern for farmers at present. Helping farmers to solve this problem very properly is also a central issue of current rural economic work.

    Many methods can be adopted to solve this problem, the main one being to mobilize farmers to save their remaining money. For farmers, appropriately saving the proceeds from grain sales will not only avoid losses, but also allow them to invest this fund in production in a planned way, according to the seasonal requirements of production, and in the places where life is most needed. This is harmless and beneficial. For the country, accumulating this extra currency put into circulation, then paying it out gradually according to the normal ratio, that is, according to the seasonal needs of the farmers, is also beneficial. This not only meets the normal needs of farmers, but also avoids the impact of currency on the market, and connects with the supply of materials, so that the circulation law of social materials and currency can be normal. This is also harmless and beneficial to the country and the farmers. As long as our work is done well, farmers will understand this principle and will actively engage in savings. For example, after the National Bank held grain sales savings in Zhangguozhuang Township in the suburbs of Beijing, it was warmly welcomed by farmers. Farmers deposited 52 percent of all grain-selling households' proceeds from grain sales into banks and credit cooperatives, and savings accounted for 58 percent of all grain-selling funds. Among them, those who saved for three to six months accounted for 93 percent of the depositors, and those who saved for less than three months accounted for only 3 percent. Judging from the term of deposit and based on the understanding of the investigation, their savings are mostly for the purpose of purchasing fertilizer, replacing farm tools, and preparing for next year's production investment in the spring of next year; some are also for repairing houses, making clothes, and holding weddings. It can be seen here that with savings, farmers can calmly calculate and properly arrange their family affairs for next year. Some farmers said: "Saving up can prevent waste, and taking it out next year can buy more fertilizer and produce more grain"; some farmers said: "The money from selling grain is deposited in the bank, which can help the country's production, build workshops, and manufacture machines; and I get more interest, and production will also increase next year." We should deeply understand the farmers' concerns, help them make plans, tell them the benefits of savings, and help them do a good job in savings.

    What are the benefits of saving in the National Bank?

    First, grain sales savings are not subject to loss. Farmers store grain at home, and insects and rodents bite and gnaw, and drying and turning must cause losses, so farmers say: "There are only ninety-nine, not one hundred and one." However, when farmers sell grain and deposit it in the bank as currency, not only will there be no loss, but they can also get interest. Now the country has full strength to ensure the stability of grain prices, so that there will not be any rise or fall in grain purchase prices this year. In this way, farmers who sell grain and deposit it early will not suffer losses. Although some farmers are still worried that "grain prices will rise in the future, and it is not worthwhile to sell them now." But this is based on their narrow historical experience. Farmers can be told that under the new circumstances, this factor will change. According to the bank's calculations, according to the preferential interest rate for current grain sales savings, storing the proceeds from grain sales now and withdrawing the principal and interest in five or six months can still buy the original amount of grain, without any loss. And you can also get some interest.

    Second, depositing grain sales funds into the National Bank can get generous interest. In order to encourage farmers to save, the National Bank has specially launched "Preferential Fixed-Term Fixed-Amount Savings for Grain Sales" with preferential interest rates. The monthly interest rate for farmers' grain sales deposits is 1.5 percent for less than three months, and 2 percent for three to six months. A simple example can be made: if a farmer sells eight or nine hundred catties of grain at one time and deposits 500,000 yuan in the bank, he can get a net interest of 60,000 yuan after six months, which is equal to an increase of seventy or eighty catties of grain. With this money, farmers can buy thirty or forty catties more fertilizer, or twenty feet more of white cloth. This interest rate is generally more than double the seasonal price difference that farmers earned in the past, which is very beneficial to farmers. The National Bank is actually losing money by paying this interest. Therefore, it can only be limited to preferential treatment for grain-selling households, and the time is limited to six months, after which it will be discontinued. In this way, it can be connected to the use of funds in the spring production season of next year. If farmers continue to save, they can be converted into general savings deposits.

    Third, grain sales savings can be withdrawn and used seasonally, so there will be no waste. Now farmers sell grain in a concentrated way and get a large sum of money at one time. If the calculation is not careful, it will be used for unnecessary expenses, resulting in waste. Farmers need money in many places. Relaxing a little and spending this fund will cause difficulties in next year's production. At the same time, if farmers deposit this money in the bank, the country can also invest more in the country's economic construction, which is also beneficial to the country. Therefore, active savings is also an important manifestation of farmers supporting the General Line.

    What are the disadvantages of not saving in the bank? There are also some people in rural areas who are unwilling or unwilling to save. This is basically because they do not have the habit of saving and do not have a clear understanding of today's savings. What will happen as a result? Because they have suffered from inflation and rising prices in the past, they only believe that storing goods is more reliable than storing money based on old experience. As a result, they blindly rush to the market to snap up goods with the money they get from selling grain, and buy some things that they don't need. This may cause a temporary imbalance in supply and demand in the market, which may affect price fluctuations. In this way, it will only benefit speculators, and it will not be good for the country or the farmers. We should explain clearly to the farmers that the country's economic situation today is different from the past. Now the country's production is normal and continuously rising, the supply of materials is sufficient, the prices are stable, and inflation has gone forever. Today, even if there is a supply imbalance in a short period of time, in a certain area, or for a certain material, state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperatives are fully capable of accelerating the transfer of materials to supply farmers' needs and stabilize the market. Therefore, storing money is still more beneficial than storing goods. Therefore, we must strengthen the publicity of the General Line and the national Five-Year Plan construction in rural areas, explain the significance of savings and the harm of rushing to buy goods, and improve farmers' understanding to reduce blindness. At the same time, we must strengthen the management of rural markets, eliminate black markets, prohibit usury, and ensure the smooth development of rural grain sales savings.

    The current rural savings work is essentially the work of preparing for next year's production investment, which is closely combined with next year's production. This is an important part of the current rural work. To this end, the responsible comrades of the local party and government must unify the leadership and deployment of this work, and must not simply regard it as the work of the bank or the work of the cooperative. And because this work is almost related to every farmer, mobilizing farmers to save must also follow the mass line, and must combine persuasion and education with adherence to voluntariness. Simple matching and apportionment methods cannot be adopted, and the proportion of savings should be determined according to the farmers' economic situation. In terms of savings working methods and procedures, we should try our best to meet the requirements and habits of farmers and provide farmers with various conveniences. We should not formulate methods from a purely business perspective, but should set up more savings points, entrust cooperatives to act as agents, and simplify and expedite deposit and withdrawal procedures. The length of deposit should be as flexible as possible, etc. For this reason, the bank must organize a large number of cadres to go to the countryside to serve. In addition, various cooperatives can be used to mobilize farmers and help them formulate their own savings, fund use, and goods use plans, and arrange for next year's production and family affairs. Various supply and marketing cooperatives should take this opportunity to strengthen their ties with their members, understand their needs for means of production and means of subsistence for next year, so as to cooperate with state-owned commercial enterprises to implement a certain degree of organized and planned supply. This is an extremely heavy and important task for current cooperatives and state-owned commercial enterprises.

    Every farmer and rural work cadre must clearly recognize that the current rural savings work is an important work to organize farmers' production investment, an important work to help farmers plan production costs, help farmers accumulate funds, and enable farmers to use this important fund reasonably in order to expand next year's production. We must vigorously develop rural savings and strive to help farmers accumulate funds for spring production next year!

### 大力开展农村储蓄工作，积蓄明春生产资金

    大力开展农村储蓄工作，积蓄明春生产资金
    各地大张旗鼓向农民宣传总路线以后，农民的认识提高了，为着国家社会主义工业化及农业的社会主义改造，纷纷将余粮卖给国家，甚至卖出多年的存粮，生动地表现了农民爱国主义的精神。但是我们必须清楚的认识到，动员农民卖出余粮还只是我们工作的一部分，还有重要的工作，就是要很好地帮助农民将卖粮款项作合理的安排，以便积蓄明年生产的资金，扩大明年的生产。这个工作也是十分重要和十分艰巨的。
    在往年，农民将余粮自己储存下来，依照生产季节的需要，陆续卖出，用以购买生产资料与生活资料，很自然的安排了一年的生产与生活。社会的生产资料与生活资料也是适应着这一种生产季节性的需要，适时的分期的供应到市场上。今年与往年不同了，农民要在短时间内集中的、大批的卖出自己的粮食，这对农民和对国家固然都是有利的，是必须的，但是由于卖粮的规律变了，而农村生产季节性的规律未变，社会物资生产与供应的规律未变，这便发生了矛盾。农民卖了粮食，手中拿了一大笔的现款，有的是目前还不到用钱的时候，有的是由于农村物资供应调运不及而未用出去，因此这一大笔钱款，如何安排呢？如何把一年辛劳的代价用到最有用的地方，用得最经济，既不会损失，又不会浪费，这是农民当前的一件大心事。帮助农民十分妥善地解决这一个问题也是当前农村经济工作的一个中心问题。
    解决这一个问题可以采取很多办法，其中主要的一条，就是动员农民将剩余的钱储蓄起来。对农民来说，把售粮钱款适当地储蓄起来，既不会受损失，还可以按照生产季节性的要求，有计划地把这一笔资金投入生产，投到生活最需要的地方，这是无损而有利的。对国家来说，将这一笔较往年例外增加投放的货币，加以蓄积，然后按照正常的比例，也就是按照农民季节性的需要陆续付给。这样既适合了农民正常的需要，又免除了货币对市场的冲击，并与物资的供应衔接起来，使社会物资与货币的流转规律能够正常，对国家和对农民，也都是无损而有利的。只要我们的工作作得好，农民是能明白这个道理的，是会积极进行储蓄的。例如国家银行在北京市郊区张郭庄乡举办售粮储蓄后，受到了农民热烈的欢迎。农民将卖出粮食所得款项存放在银行及信用合作社内的占全体售粮户的百分之五十二，储款占全部售粮款的百分之五十八。其中储蓄三个月到六个月的占存户百分之九十三，储三个月以下的只占百分之三。从存款期限上看，和根据调查的了解，他们储蓄多是为着明春购买肥料、添换农具、准备明年生产投资之用；也有一些是为了修盖房屋、以及做衣服办喜事。这里可以看到，有了储蓄，农民就能从容地加以计算，妥善地安排明年的家计。有的农民说：“储蓄起来，可以不浪费了，明年取出来，可以多买肥料，又多打粮食”；有的农民说：“卖粮的钱存在银行里，可以帮助国家生产，盖工房、造机器；自己多得了利息，明年也增加了生产”。我们应当深切地体会农民的心事，帮他们作打算，告诉他们储蓄的好处，帮助他们作好储蓄工作。
    向国家银行储蓄有什么好处呢？
    第一、售粮储蓄，不受损失。农民把粮食存放在家中，虫咬鼠啮、翻晒倒腾，一定要有损耗，所以农民说：“只有九十九，没有一百一。”但是农民卖了粮食到银行以货币存款，不但不会有损失，而且可以得到利息。现在国家完全有力量，保证粮食价格的稳定，可以使今年粮食收购价格不致有什么涨落。这样，农民早卖粮、早存款，便不致吃亏。虽然有些农民还担心“粮食价格以后会涨，现在卖了不合算”。但这是根据他们狭隘的历史经验出发的。可以告诉农民，在新的情况下，这种因素是会改变的。据银行的计算，根据现行售粮储款的优待利息，将现在卖粮的款项存储起来，五、六个月后取出本利，还可以买到原数的粮食，这是一点损失没有的。而且还可得点利息。
    第二、将售粮款项存入国家银行，可以得到优厚的利息。国家银行为了鼓励农民储蓄，特别举办了有优厚利率的“优待售粮定期定额储蓄”，农民售粮存款在三个月以下的月息一分五厘，存款在三个月到六个月的月息二分。可以简单做个例比，如果一户农民一次卖出八、九百斤粮食，存入银行储蓄五十万元，六个月后取款，可以净得利息六万元，等于增加了七、八十斤粮食的数目，农民得到这笔钱，可以多买三、四十斤肥田粉，可以多买二十尺白布。这笔利息比较过去农民得的季节差价，大体上高过一倍，对农民是很有利的。在国家银行付出这笔利息，实际上是赔本的。因此只能限于优待售粮户，时间规定六个月，过期停办，这样，便可接上明春生产季节的用款，如农民继续存储，可转为一般储蓄存款。
    第三、售粮储蓄按季节取出使用，便不致浪费。现在农民集中售粮，一次便得到一大笔钱款，如果计算不周到，便会用于不必要的化费，发生浪费。农民需要用钱的地方很多，放松一下，花掉了这笔资金，便造成明年生产的困难。同时，农民把这笔钱存入银行，对国家来说，也可以多投资在国家经济建设事业上，对国家也是有利的。因此，积极储蓄也就是农民拥护总路线的一个重要表现。
    不向银行储蓄又有什么坏处呢？农村中也有一部分人，不愿意或者不肯储蓄。这基本上是由于他们没有储蓄的习惯，对今天的储蓄认识不清。这会发生什么结果呢？他们由于在过去遭受了通货膨胀，物价上涨的苦处，因此根据旧的经验，只认为存货比存钱靠得住，于是盲目地把售粮所得的钱款，争先恐后地到市场上去抢购物资，把一些并不需要的东西，也购买去了。这就可能造成市场上一时的供求失调，以致影响物价波动，这样，只有利于投机商人，对国家、对农民都是没有好处的。我们应当向农民讲解清楚，今天国家的经济情况和过去不同了。现在国家的生产是正常的、不断上升的，物资供应是充足的，物价是稳定的，通货膨胀已一去不复返。今天即使在一个短时间，在某个地区、某种物资发生供应失调，国营商业和合作社也完全有力量加速调运物资，以供应农民需要，稳定市场。所以还是存钱比存货有利。所以，我们一定要在农村中加强总路线和国家五年计划建设的宣传，讲清楚储蓄的意义以及抢购物资的为害，提高农民的认识，以减少盲目性。同时要加强农村市场的管理，消灭黑市，禁止高利贷，保证农村售粮储蓄的顺利开展。
    当前农村的储蓄工作实质上是准备明年生产投资的工作，是和明年的生产密切结合的，这是当前农村工作中的一个重要部分。为此，当地党政的负责同志必须统一的领导和布置这件工作，而不能简单地把它看做是银行的工作、合作社的工作。又由于这件工作差不多与每个农民皆发生一定的联系，动员农民储蓄也就要走群众路线，必须做到说服教育与坚持自愿相结合，不能采用简单的搭配与平摊的办法，依照农民的经济情况，确定储款的比例。在储蓄工作方法与手续上，应尽量做到适合农民的要求与习惯，给农民以各种方便，不能从单纯的业务观点去制定办法，要多设储蓄点子，要委托合作社代理；存款、取款手续要简单、捷便；存期长短要尽量灵活等等，为此，银行必须组织大批干部到农村去服务。另外，可以通过各种合作社去发动农民并帮助他们自订储蓄、用款、用货的计划，安排明年的生产与家计。各个供销合作社要借此加强与社员的联系，了解他们对明年生产资料与生活资料的需要，以便与国营商业配合起来，实行一定程度的有组织有计划的供应，这是当前合作社与国营商业一件极为繁重的重要工作。
    必须使每个农民及农村工作干部明确地认识：目前农村储蓄工作，是组织农民生产投资的重要工作，是帮助农民计划生产费用、帮助农民积蓄资金，并使农民将这一笔重要的资金得以合理的使用，以便扩大明年生产的重要工作。必须大力开展农村储蓄，为帮助农民积蓄明春生产资金而努力！
