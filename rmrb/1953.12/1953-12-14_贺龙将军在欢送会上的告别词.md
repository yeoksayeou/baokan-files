Comrades,

The nearly two months of慰问 work are coming to an end, and we are about to return to our motherland. Here, with a feeling of reluctance, I represent all the comrades of the Third Chinese People's Delegation to Korea to bid farewell to you – the most beloved people of our motherland. I truly have unspeakable nostalgia.

Korea, the Korea where you have fought bloody battles for three years, since I set foot on this glorious land, I have personally witnessed the great achievements you have made for the motherland, for Korea, and for the peace-loving people of the world over the past three years. I cannot forget any position you have fought for, nor can I forget the homes you have built for the Korean people from the ruins. I especially cannot forget the underground Great Wall you have built with blood and sweat. This underground Great Wall has consolidated the front line of the Chinese and Korean people resisting the enemy's attack. Because you have such a solid front, especially because of your ever-stronger combat effectiveness, you have defeated the American imperialists and their vassal states' armies, crushed Li Seung-man's gang's war clamors, especially in this year's famous summer campaign, defeating nine divisions of the American and Li gangs, causing them casualties of about 130,000, and advancing our position 18 kilometers forward, which more powerfully forced American imperialism to sign the armistice agreement. This time I personally went to many positions on the front line. On these positions, the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army fought countless victories, and tens of thousands of heroes and meritorious persons emerged, annihilating millions of barbaric enemies. I also personally talked with many battle-tested generals who mastered modern command art, and I also personally held symposiums with incomparably brave combat heroes, listening to their personal experiences. Their spirit of selfless sacrifice and high degree of revolutionary heroism deserve to be good soldiers of Mao Zedong and the most outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people. I can say with certainty that if the American imperialist warmongers dare to launch another war, they will suffer even more disastrous defeats.

Comrades, isn't this ironclad proof that you are getting stronger as you fight?

Comrades, who can say that you are not great warriors for peace? The people of the motherland call you the most beloved people, and I think you deserve it. Comrades, dear comrades, please allow me to express my greatest respect to you.

Your love for the Korean people has also deeply moved me. After the armistice, one of your units contributed more than 130,000 workdays to building roads, bridges, factories, houses, and cinemas for the Korean people. This has never happened in history. Before the armistice, just to repair the Guicheng Fengshan reservoir destroyed by enemy aircraft, you organized a repair team of more than 1,000 people, built a flood control dam more than 200 meters long, blocked the impact of mountain torrents, and ensured the bumper harvest of more than 300,000 mu of land, thus winning Marshal Kim Il-sung's letter of thanks for "Eternal and Immortal Friendship." Like such examples, each of your units can cite many.

Comrades, isn't this as glorious as defeating the enemy on the battlefield? I have contacted many Korean people, and their respect and love for our Chinese people and our great leader Chairman Mao are indescribable. In the People's Army positions, a six-year-old child can sing "The East is Red," and everywhere you see slogans such as "Korean-Chinese Friendship Forever" and "Thank Chairman Mao Zedong for Sincere Assistance to Our Country." When Chinese and Koreans meet, no matter whether they can communicate in words or not, their feelings immediately merge. Especially the soldiers of the People's Army, as soon as they see us, they swarm up to us, and when they talk about you, they talk about the scene of holding the same determination in the same trench to strike the same enemy. When sleeping, the People's Army and the Volunteers sleep side by side on the same kang, which can be regarded as fighting side by side, united and without gaps. Whenever I hear these things, I immediately feel that this is the achievement of your resolute implementation of the wise instructions of the Party and Chairman Mao, and also the achievement of your uniting the Korean people and supporting the instructions of the Korean government and its leader Marshal Kim Il-sung. I cannot but deeply thank you, you have used blood, sweat, and even precious lives to do the best internationalist solidarity work for the people of the motherland and Chairman Mao. This kind of internationalist solidarity will make American imperialism tremble when they hear it. And for the people of our two countries, China and Korea, it is truly as the Korean comrades themselves said, it will be passed down for thousands of generations.

Comrades, isn't this your glory? Yes, this is your glory, the greatest glory. I heartily congratulate you on this greatest glory.

For the sake of national construction, after the ceasefire, you responded to the motherland's call for increasing production and practicing economy. Every time I went to a position, I saw the artillery shells you picked up around the position. One unit picked up more than 200,000 jin in one month. Saving one or two liang of grain per person per day has been generally achieved, and some have even saved more than one or two liang. Saving the timber sent by the motherland to build houses, and taking out all the money that can be saved to build the motherland. Seeing these scenes, I cannot help but think that if the Volunteers can save like this, we people in the motherland should learn from you, and more vigorously practice economy and build the motherland. Therefore, I am more full of confidence in the completion of our motherland's first five-year plan.

Comrades, I also saw that although Korea has ceased fighting today, the lives of the Korean people are still very difficult, and the restoration and construction are still difficult. The economic and cultural cooperation agreement between China and Korea recently signed in Beijing by Marshal Kim Il-sung and Premier Zhou Enlai is precisely to help the Korean people recover after the war, and further expresses our Chinese people's, our great leader Chairman Mao's deep concern for the friendship between China and Korea and for peace in the Far East. I think that you in Korea should also work hard to assist our government in implementing this agreement, and like helping the Korean people during the war, use your strength in a more planned way to help the Korean people carry out spring plowing production, manufacture agricultural tools, and exchange some production knowledge and organization production methods. In this way, the friendship between our Chinese people and the Korean people will be further consolidated.

However, comrades, I also saw that the enemy is only four kilometers away from you – eight li, and the enemy is still adding to the fortifications and conducting military exercises every day, which cannot but arouse our utmost vigilance. You are soldiers, and the task of soldiers is to take up guns to defend the construction of the motherland and defend peace. Therefore, you cannot have any illusions, you cannot have any carelessness, and you must be vigilant against the enemy's sudden attack at any time. Therefore, you must carefully repair your fortifications, train well, sum up experience, and unite the Korean people. The more solid your fortifications are, the better your training, the more proficient your military science, the tighter the guns you hold in your hands, the greater your power to defend the construction of the motherland and defend world peace, and no matter how cunning and rogue the enemy is, they cannot escape your grasp. Comrades, you are the defenders of Korea and the people of the motherland, and also the defenders of peace in the Far East and the world. The Korean people, the people of the motherland, and the peace-loving people all over the world are watching you and caring about you. They are all comforted because you are holding on to the 38th parallel. Your responsibility is great, and it is also the most glorious. American imperialism and the Li Seung-man gang are continuing to obstruct the convening of the political conference. They are妄想 to make a comeback, disrupt peace, and re-ignite the war. I believe that you will annihilate them as you did in the past!

Dear Comrades: Goodbye, after returning to the motherland, we must bring back your great achievements, your deep friendship with the Korean people, your highest vigilance against the enemy, and especially your love and loyalty to the motherland and Chairman Mao, to encourage the people of the whole country to devote themselves wholeheartedly to the great construction of the motherland, and continue to fully support you!

Finally, I should express my gratitude to you, to all the military, political, and logistics personnel of all the troops and services who assisted us in our慰问 work, thank you for the assistance and encouragement you gave us in our work in all aspects, so that we can successfully complete our task!

Long live the great motherland!

Long live the Chinese People's Volunteers!

Long live our Party and our great leader Chairman Mao who lead the construction of our motherland and inspire the courage of our Volunteers!

Long live the eternal and immortal friendship between the people of China and Korea!

### 贺龙将军在欢送会上的告别词

    贺龙将军在欢送会上的告别词亲爱的同志们：
    将近两个月的慰问工作，现在快要结束了，我们就要回到祖国去，在这里我怀着依依不舍的心情，代表中国人民第三届赴朝慰问团全体同志来向你们——我们祖国最可爱的人告别，我真是有说不出的留恋。
    朝鲜，你们三年来血战的朝鲜，自从我踏上这块光荣的国土以后，我就亲眼看到你们三年来为祖国、为朝鲜、为全世界爱好和平的人民所建树的伟大功勋，我不能忘记任何一个你们曾经争夺过的阵地，我也不能忘记你们为朝鲜人民从废墟中所建立起来的家园，我尤其不能忘记你们用血和汗修筑起来的地下长城，这个地下长城把朝中人民抵抗敌人进攻的阵线巩固下来了。由于你们有了这样巩固的阵线，特别是由于你们愈战愈强的战斗力，把美帝国主义及其仆从国家的军队打败了，把李承晚匪帮的战争叫嚣打得稀烂，尤其在今年有名的夏季战役中，打了美李匪帮九个师，使他们伤亡达十三万人左右，把我方的阵地向前推进了十八公里，更有力地迫使美帝国主义不敢不在停战协定上签字。我这次亲自到了前线上的许多阵地，在这些阵地上中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军打了无数的胜仗，出现了几十万的英雄功臣，歼灭了成百万的野蛮敌人；我也亲自和许多掌握现代指挥艺术的百战百胜的将军们谈过话，我也亲自和英勇无比的战斗英雄们开过座谈会，听取他们的亲身经历，他们那种忘我牺牲的精神，高度的革命英雄主义，不愧是毛泽东的好战士，中国人民最优秀的儿女。我肯定地说，如果美帝国主义战争贩子们胆敢再发动战争，他们必将遭受更惨重的失败。
    同志们，这难道不是你们越战越强的铁证吗？
    同志们，谁能说你们不是伟大的和平战士呢？祖国人民称你们为最可爱的人，我想你们是当之无愧。同志们，亲爱的同志们，请允许我向你们表示最大的敬意。
    你们对朝鲜人民的友爱，也使我非常感动。停战后你们有一个部队出了十三万多个工，为朝鲜人民修路、修桥梁、修工厂、修房子、修学校、修电影院，这是历史上从来没有过的。停战以前单为修复被敌机炸毁的龟城丰山贮水池，你们就组织了一个一千多人的抢修队，筑成两百多公尺长的防汛坝，阻挡了山洪暴发的冲击，保证了三十多万亩地的丰收，因而荣获金日成元帅“永恒不灭的友谊”的感谢信。像这样的例子，你们每个部队都可以举出很多来。
    同志们：这难道不是和你们在战场上打败敌人一样的光荣吗？我接触过好多朝鲜人民，他们对我们中国人民和我们伟大领袖毛主席的尊敬和热爱是难以形容的。在人民军阵地，一个六岁的孩子就会唱“东方红”，到处看到“朝中永远亲善”、“感谢诚心诚意援助我国的毛泽东主席”的标语。中国人和朝鲜人一见面，无论话讲的通讲不通，感情马上就会融汇起来，特别是人民军的战士们，一见我们就纷纷拥上前来，一讲起你们，就说起在一个战壕抱着同样的决心打击同一的敌人的情景，睡觉的时候，一个炕上人民军和志愿军并头同睡，真可算得并肩作战，团结无间。每当听到这些事情的时候，我就马上感到，这是你们坚决执行党和毛主席的英明指示的成就，也是你们团结朝鲜人民、拥护朝鲜政府及其领袖金日成元帅指示的成就。我不能不深深感谢你们，你们用血、用汗、以至于用宝贵的生命为祖国人民和毛主席作了最好的国际主义的团结工作，这种国际主义的团结，美帝国主义听到就会发抖。而对我们朝中两国人民来说，那就真是如朝鲜同志自己所说的将千秋万代的流传下去。
    同志们：这难道不是你们的光荣吗？是的，这是你们的光荣，最大的光荣。我衷心祝贺你们这个最大的光荣。
    为了国家建设，你们在停火之后，就响应祖国增产节约的号召。我每到一个阵地，就看到你们在阵地周围拾起来的炮弹壳，有一个部队一个月就拾了二十多万斤。每人每天节约一两粮食，已经普遍做到，有的节约还超过一两。节省祖国运来盖房子的木料，把一切可能节省的钱拿出建设祖国。看到这些情景，我也不禁想，志愿军还能这样节约，我们在祖国的人应向你们学习，更加厉行节约，建设祖国。我因此对我们祖国第一个五年建设计划的完成更充满了信心。
    同志们，我还看到，朝鲜今天虽然停战了，但朝鲜人民的生活还是很艰苦的，恢复建设也还是有困难的。最近金日成元帅和周恩来总理在北京签订的朝中两国经济和文化合作协定，正是为了帮助朝鲜人民战后的恢复，进一步表示我们中国人民，我们伟大的领袖毛主席对朝中友谊和远东和平的深切关怀。我想，你们在朝鲜也要好好地来协助我国政府执行这一协定，像在战争时期帮助朝鲜人民一样，更有计划的来使用力量，帮助朝鲜人民进行春耕生产，制造农具，并交流一些生产知识和组织生产的办法。这样，我们中国人民和朝鲜人民的友谊将会更进一步地巩固下去。
    但是，同志们，我也看到敌人离你们只有四公里——八华里，而且敌人还在天天加修工事，进行军事演习，这就不能不引起我们万分警惕。你们是军人，军人的任务就是拿枪杆子保卫祖国建设，保卫和平，因此你们不能有任何幻想，不能有任何麻痹大意，随时要提防敌人的突然袭击。所以你们要很好地检修你们的工事，好好地练兵，总结经验，团结朝鲜人民。你们的工事越巩固，兵练的越好，军事科学越精通，你们手中握的枪越紧，你们保卫祖国建设、保卫世界和平的力量就越大，敌人就是再狡猾，再耍流氓，也跳不出你们的手心。同志们，你们是朝鲜和祖国人民的保卫者，也是远东与世界和平的保卫者，朝鲜人民，祖国人民，全世界爱好和平的人民都注视着你们，关怀着你们，都因为有你们坚守着三八线而得到安慰，你们的责任是重大的，也是最光荣的。美帝国主义，李承晚匪帮，正在继续阻挠政治会议的召开，他们妄想卷土重来，破坏和平，重新挑起战争，我相信你们一定会像过去一样来歼灭它！
    亲爱的同志们：再会了，回到祖国后，我们一定要把你们的伟大功勋，把你们对朝鲜人民的深厚友谊，把你们对敌人的最高警惕性，特别是把你们对祖国和毛主席的热爱和忠诚带回去，鼓励全国人民，全心全力投进伟大的祖国建设，并继续全力支援你们！
    最后，我应当向你们，向协助我们进行慰问工作的所有部队、所有兵种的军事工作人员、政治工作人员以及后勤工作人员表示感谢，感谢你们在我们的工作中给予的各方面的帮助和鼓励，使我们能够圆满地完成我们的任务！
    伟大的祖国万岁！
    中国人民志愿军万岁！
    领导我们祖国建设、鼓舞我们志愿军勇气的我们的党和伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！
    朝中两国人民永恒不灭的友谊万岁！
