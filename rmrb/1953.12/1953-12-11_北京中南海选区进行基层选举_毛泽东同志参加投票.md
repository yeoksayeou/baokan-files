The leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong, and his comrades-in-arms participated in the voting together with the voters of the district.

    Before the election, the voters of the Zhongnanhai electoral district completed all the necessary preparations in accordance with the provisions of the Election Law. The staff of the Party Central Committee and the Central People's Government organs enthusiastically carried out voter registration and the nomination of representative candidates before the election. The electoral district had two representative positions. After joint consultation between the Committee of Organs Directly Under the CPC Central Committee and the democratic parties and people's organizations of the Central Government's directly affiliated organs, Communist Party member Wang Jingxian and non-party personage Shen Qian were jointly nominated as representative candidates.

    The election was held at four polling stations from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM on the 8th and 10th.

At the entrance of the polling stations, long plaques bearing the words "Polling Station of Zhongnanhai Electoral District, Xidan District, Beijing Municipality" were hung. Bright red national flags were hung inside the polling stations. In front of the red ballot boxes, beautiful potted chrysanthemums and various flowers were arranged. The election work group had prepared all the facilities to facilitate voters in conducting the election in the room a few days ago. Each polling station was filled with a solemn and simple atmosphere. After the voting began, voters stepped on the light snow of early winter, carrying their voter registration cards and successively entering the polling stations.

    The election was conducted in a solemn atmosphere. Participating in the voting were many revolutionary leaders of the leading organs of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, senior leaders of the Central People's Government, democratic personages from various parties and non-party individuals, as well as all Communist Party members and staff members from various departments within the organs.

After presenting their voter registration cards at the verification and ballot distribution point, they received and filled out their ballots. At 8:40 PM, Comrade Mao Zedong and the leading comrades of the CPC Central Committee successively cast their votes into the ballot boxes. After voting, Comrade Mao Zedong shook hands with Du Ruo, Secretary of the Xidan District Committee of the CPC Beijing Municipal Committee and Head of the Xidan District People's Government, and Li Zhesheng, Chairman of the Xidan District Election Committee, one by one.

    According to Xinhua News Agency: The primary-level election work in the capital of the great motherland has been fully launched in various districts within the city since December 6th. More than 2,000 general election reporters and literary propaganda workers have enthusiastically launched general election propaganda activities in various factories, enterprises, organs, organizations, schools, and streets.

    In recent days, report meetings have been held one after another in various electoral districts. In Chongwen District, 37,000 people, including workers, students, industrialists and merchants, and street residents, listened to general election reports in two days. The East Chang'an District Federation of Trade Unions has held fifteen report meetings, giving general election reports to more than 9,000 workers and staff members in private factories and shops throughout the district.
