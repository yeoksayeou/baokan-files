"Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Issue 49 in Chinese, the organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, has been published in 1953.

This issue publishes an editorial entitled "The Soviet Constitution is the Most Democratic Constitution in the World." The editorial points out: December 5th—Soviet Constitution Day is a great festival for the Soviet working people and all progressive people in the world. The Soviet Constitution, based on the indestructible principles of the invincible doctrine of Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin, has fixed the greatest achievements of the Soviet people. The foundation of the Soviet Constitution is the socialist principle: the socialist ownership of the means of production. Due to the victory of socialism in the Soviet Union, it has become possible for all Soviet people to enjoy extensive democratic rights. Soviet socialist democracy is true democracy shared by all the people. The Soviet Constitution has become a model for all people's democratic countries advancing confidently along the road of socialist construction. The working people of the world look to the banner of the Soviet Constitution with hope and confidence, believing that they will surely win in the struggle for peace and democratic rights.

Important articles published in this issue include: "Constant Concern for the Welfare of the Working People is the Primary Responsibility of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and Government" by Ya. Duranski, Secretary of the Political Secretariat of the Czechoslovak Communist Party; "Struggle for the Freedom and Independence of Morocco" by Ali Yata, Secretary of the Moroccan Communist Party; "Fundamental Changes in the Lives of the Albanian People" by B. Spasiu, Member of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party.

Duranski's article points out: The measures taken by the Czechoslovak Communist Party and government in the past few years and some measures currently being implemented are to maximize the satisfaction of the ever-growing material and cultural needs of the working people. The Czechoslovak working people have made significant achievements in developing and transforming the national economy, and have achieved great victories in improving their welfare. However, based on the achievements of socialist construction, and considering the labor enthusiasm and capabilities of the working class and all working people, the Party and government have decided to accelerate the improvement of their living standards. According to the law of planned (proportional) development of the national economy, it is now necessary to slightly reduce the development speed of heavy industry in order to concentrate efforts on accelerating the construction of raw material and power bases, while concentrating maximum financial and human resources to ensure a substantial increase in agricultural output.

B. Spasiu's article was written to celebrate the ninth anniversary of the liberation of Albania. The article says: November 29, 1944, marked a great turning point in the history of the Albanian people. Albania has firmly embarked on the road to laying the foundations of socialism. Now, our people are completing the first five-year plan (1951-1955). In the first six years of the people's regime, our industry not only reached but also exceeded the pre-war level. By the end of the five-year plan, Albania will transform from a backward agricultural country into an agricultural-industrial country. The article continues: Our Party and government have always been very concerned about improving the lives of the working people. Recently, the government has also passed some resolutions to ensure further improvement of the people's material and cultural standards, and to further strengthen the alliance between the working class and the working peasants.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第四十九期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五三年第四十九期已经出版。
    本期以“苏联宪法是世界上最民主的宪法”为题发表社论。社论指出：十二月五日——苏联宪法日是苏联劳动人民和全世界一切进步人士的伟大节日。以战无不胜的马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林学说的不可摧毁的原则为依据的苏联宪法，把苏联人民所获得的最伟大的成果固定了下来。构成苏联宪法的基础是社会主义的原则：生产工具和生产资料的社会主义所有制。由于苏联社会主义的胜利，就使得全体苏联人民有可能享受广泛的民主权利。苏维埃社会主义民主是全体人民所共享的真正的民主。苏联宪法已成为一切满怀信心地沿着社会主义建设道路前进的人民民主国家的典范。全世界劳动人民满怀希望和信心，瞩望着苏联宪法的旗帜，相信自己在争取和平和民主权利的斗争中一定胜利。
    本期刊载的重要文章有：捷克斯洛伐克共产党政治书记处书记雅·杜兰斯基的“经常关怀劳动人民的福利是捷克斯洛伐克共产党和政府的首要职责”，摩洛哥共产党书记阿里·雅塔的“为摩洛哥的自由和独立而斗争”，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员伯·斯巴修的“阿尔巴尼亚人民生活的根本变化”等。
    杜兰斯基的文章指出：捷克斯洛伐克共产党和政府过去几年来所采取的措施以及目前正在执行的一些措施，是为了最大限度地满足劳动人民经常增长的物质和文化需要。捷克斯洛伐克劳动人民在发展和改造国民经济方面已经取得了重大成就，在增进自己的福利方面取得了巨大胜利。但是党和政府根据社会主义建设的成就，并考虑到工人阶级和全体劳动人民的劳动热情和能力，决定加速提高他们的生活水平。根据国民经济有计划的（按比例的）发展的法则，现在必须稍微降低重工业的发展速度，以便集中力量来加速建设原料和动力基地，同时要集中最大限度的财力和人力以保证大大提高农业产量。
    伯·斯巴修的文章是为庆祝阿尔巴尼亚解放九周年而写的。文章说：一九四四年十一月二十九日标志着阿尔巴尼亚人民历史上的一个伟大转变。阿尔巴尼亚已经坚定地走上了奠定社会主义基础的道路。现在，我国人民正在完成第一个五年计划（一九五一—一九五五年）。在人民政权的最初六年中，我们的工业不仅达到而且超过了战前水平。到五年计划结束时，阿尔巴尼亚将由一个落后的农业国变成一个农业—工业国家。文章接着说：我们的党和政府一向非常关怀劳动人民生活的改善。最近政府又通过了一些决议，保证进一步提高人民的物质和文化水平，并进一步加强工人阶级和劳动农民的联盟。
