Gaokan Agricultural Production Cooperative

Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the farmers of the Gaokan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Gaokan Village, a suburb of Shenyang, implemented the production experience of Zhaoyuan County in Heilongjiang Province, adopted new technologies, and rationally organized labor, achieving an unprecedented bumper harvest this year. The cooperative has a total of 633 mu of cultivated land, producing 485,795 jin of grain, with an average yield of 767 jin per mu, an increase of 75 percent over the highest yield before liberation. It is one to two times higher than the local average yield. Their victory has created a good example for farmers across the country to embark on the road of mutual aid and cooperation. This is the scene of the members of the Gaokan Agricultural Production Cooperative busily threshing grain with a thresher.

Sixty-nine-year-old cooperative member Ni Yuling said to another cooperative member: "Look, our cooperative is selling such good grain to the country, Chairman Mao will be happy to see it."

Cooperative members can earn an average of more than 40 jin of grain per work day. Zhao Hengzhen and his brother earned more than 18,000 jin for their labor, and the cooperative is responsible for delivering the grain they earned to their homes.

Cooperative Chairman Zhang Zhenfa explained the general line of the state during the transition period to the cooperative members, calling on all cooperative members to sell surplus grain to the state.

Cooperative members raise large and small pigs to ensure the supply to the cities.

After the wheat harvest, cooperative members also planted many vegetables, which can both meet the needs of the city and increase income.

Female cooperative members selected seeds for expanding production next spring while threshing grain.

Technicians from the agricultural technology guidance station are tidying up the disc harrow in preparation for use in expanding production next year.

After hearing the cooperative chairman explain the general line of the state during the transition period, the cooperative members actively responded to the call to screen and pack the surplus grain, ready to haul it to the grain station and sell it to the state.

On the basis of increased production, the cooperative built a primary school. The children of cooperative members have the opportunity to receive education. These farmers' children are playing games on the playground after class.

In order to strive for a greater harvest next year, most of the cooperative's land has been autumn-plowed with tractors with the help of the agricultural technology guidance station.

Members of the Gaokan Agricultural Production Cooperative and the Xinglong Agricultural Production Cooperative in the same village are rushing to transport public grain to the city in large carts and hand it over to the state.

    高坎农业生产合作社
    共产党和人民政府领导下的沈阳市郊区高坎村高坎农业生产合作社的农民推行了黑龙江省肇源县的生产经验，采用了新的技术，合理地组织了劳动力，今年获得空前丰收。全社共有六百三十三亩耕地，产粮四十八万五千七百九十五斤，平均每亩产量为七百六十七斤，比解放前最高产量提高了百分之七十五。较当地一般产量高一倍到两倍。他们的胜利为全国农民走向互助合作的道路创造了好的榜样。这是高坎农业生产合作社的社员们正在用脱谷机紧张打场的情形。
    六十九岁的老社员倪玉龄。他对另一个社员说：“你看，咱们社里把这样好的粮食卖给国家，毛主席见了也高兴。”
    社员平均一个工作日可以分得四十多斤的粮食。赵恒珍兄弟二人参加劳动共分了一万八千多斤，社里并负责把分得的粮食送到他们家里去。
    社主席张振发向社员们讲解了国家过渡时期总路线，号召全体社员把余粮卖给国家。
    社员们饲养了大猪小猪，保证对城市的供应。
    麦收之后社员们还种了很多蔬菜，既能供城市需要又能增加收入。
    女社员在打场时就把明年春天扩大生产用的种籽选好了。
    农业技术指导站的技术工人把圆盘耙整理好，准备明年扩大生产时使用。
    社员们听到社主席讲解国家过渡时期总路线之后，积极响应号召把余粮筛净、装好，准备拉到收粮站去卖给国家。
    在生产提高的基础上，社里修了一座小学校。社员们的子女得到受教育的机会。这些农民的孩子们下课的时候正在操场上作游戏。
    为了争取明年更大的丰收，社里的大部分土地已在农业技术指导站的帮助之下用拖拉机进行了秋耕。
    高坎农业生产合作社和同村的兴隆农业生产合作社的社员们争先恐后地把公粮用大车运到城里，缴给国家。
