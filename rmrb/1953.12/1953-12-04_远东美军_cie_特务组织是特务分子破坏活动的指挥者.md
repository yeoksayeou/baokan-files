The Korean-Chinese side has obtained conclusive evidence proving that the Far East U.S. Military's "CIE" special agent organization directed the Kuomintang special agents in the Tongchang-ri prisoner-of-war camp to carry out sabotage of the explanation work.

The U.S. military radio receiver intercepted by the Indian custodial forces on November 7th has proven to have been smuggled into the camp by the notorious Far East U.S. military's special agent organization "CIE." According to the letter from the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to the Korean-Chinese side, this radio receiver was packaged in Tokyo in September of this year, and the receiver was marked with: Army Unit 8239, 1st Radio Broadcast and Publication Team (formerly translated as 1st Radio Broadcast and Leaflet Group), Military Post Office Box 500. Evidence has now been obtained that the 1st Radio Broadcast and Publication Team is the "CIE" special agent organization. A Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoner of war who recently returned from repatriation brought out a book compiled by James Yen, called "The Mass Education Movement." On the lower left of the first page of this book, there are Chinese characters printed: "U.S. Army Far East Garrison First Broadcast Publication Team (Formerly Civilian News Education Office)". Above it is printed in English: "1ST RADIO BROADCAST AND LEAFLET GROUP (FORMERLY CIAND E) US ARMED FORCES FAREAST". The facts are very clear that the "CIE" special agent organization of the Far East U.S. Military smuggled the radio receiver to the special agents, directing their sabotage of the explanation work and the criminal activities of forcibly detaining prisoners of war. However, according to the Associated Press, after the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission condemned the U.S. side for smuggling the radio receiver to the special agents on November 13th, the U.S. side still brazenly stated in a letter to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission that it knew nothing about the radio receiver.

According to reports from our repatriated prisoners of war, the "CIE School" in the Tongchang-ri prisoner-of-war camp was the center for the Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents to plan sabotage of explanation work and persecute prisoners of war. Wang Shunqing, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agent leader and "Commander" of the "First Regiment," was the "Principal" of the "First Regiment's" "CIE School." This type of "CIE" special agent organization was moved in its entirety from the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps. As early as the autumn of 1951, the U.S. military headquarters in Tokyo dispatched many U.S. military officers to establish "CIE Schools" in the U.S. prisoner-of-war camps on Geoje Island, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits from Taiwan sent many special agents to serve as "Instructors" in the "Schools." This so-called "School" was actually a terrorist organization where U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents forcibly conducted fascist education on prisoners of war, forced prisoners of war to tattoo themselves, write oaths in blood, and conduct "screening." When the armistice agreement was about to be signed, the U.S. military authorities actively deployed to move this type of special agent organization into the neutral nations custodial camps. Wang Xu, a returning volunteer army prisoner of war, said that on July 19th, Hansen, the head of the Psychological Warfare Department of the U.S. military headquarters in Tokyo, and Ausman, the head of "CIE," went to the prisoner-of-war camp on Jeju Island. They openly stated at a meeting of "Battalion Commanders" and above that the original "CI E" staff, "Priests," "Pastors," "Monks," and prisoner-of-war camp management personnel in the prisoner-of-war camp would go to the neutral zone along with the prisoners of war. Many returning prisoners of war from our side have proven that the "CIE's" Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents "Teacher Ma," "Teacher Wu," "Teacher Zhu," etc., have all infiltrated the neutral nations custodial camps. "Teacher Ma" infiltrated the U.S. 64th Field Hospital under the name of "translator" and continued to direct special agents to carry out sabotage activities.

According to reports from our repatriated prisoners of war, the activities of sabotaging the explanation work carried out by the "CIE School" in the neutral nations custodial camps are as follows: First, forcibly conducting reactionary education on prisoners of war, intimidating and deceiving them to prevent them from requesting repatriation. When prisoners of war were on Geoje Island and Jeju Island, they were forced to "attend classes" for four to six hours a week, but now they have to "attend classes" for five hours a day. After the bugle call every day, the "security guards" would take sticks and search each tent, forcing prisoners of war to "attend classes." Anyone who did not go to "attend classes" would be beaten. Anyone who did not "attend classes" quietly would be dragged to the podium to stand at attention as punishment. The "Instructors" were the "Education Section Chiefs" of the "Battalion Headquarters" of the "CIE," and the textbooks were supplied by the "CIE" headquarters of the U.S. military in Tokyo.

Second, planning sabotage of the explanation work, forcing prisoners of war to rehearse, and requiring prisoners of war to memorize more than one hundred slanderous "questions" printed by the U.S. military "CIE" organization to "interrogate the Communist explanation representatives." He Tianlong, a returning volunteer army prisoner of war, said that before coming to Tongchang-ri in late August, he personally saw U.S. soldiers using jeeps to send the printed "questions" to Zhang Zunxian, the "Principal" of the "CIE School" of the Third Regiment, and then he distributed them to the large teams, companies, and squads. The "Education Section Chiefs" of the large teams and the "Education Committee Members" of the companies organized by the "CIE" forced the prisoners of war to rehearse. During the explanation work, the special agents used these "questions" to entangle the explanation representatives and delay the explanation time.

Third, forcing prisoners of war to carry out "demonstrations" against the explanation, against the Indian custodial forces, and against the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The slogans and catchphrases used in the demonstrations were drafted by the U.S. military "CIE" organization. Wang Xu, a returning volunteer army prisoner of war, said that before he came to Tongchang-ri, he had seen forty-seven slogans typed in English on a typewriter at the office of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agent Zhang Zunxian. Zhang Zunxian told him that this was sent to him by "Teacher Ma," a Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agent of the "CI E." Later, he translated these slogans into Chinese and distributed them to the special agents for writing slogans and chanting catchphrases.

Fourth, monitoring and murdering prisoners of war who wanted to return to their country. According to Chang Zhongxin, a returning volunteer army prisoner of war, Zhang Yuwang, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agent "Battalion Commander" of Camp No. 28, wrote to Zhang Zunxian, the "Principal" of the "CIE School," a Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agent leader, to ask for instructions before murdering Zhang Zilong. One of the main culprits in the murder of Zhang Zilong was Shi Yun, the "Education Section Chief" of the "CIE" of Camp No. 28. Returning prisoners of war from our side said: The Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents of the "CIE School" received instructions from the U.S. side on sabotaging the explanation work through radio receivers. Some of these radio receivers were brought in by Chiang Kai-shek bandit special agents when they infiltrated the camp, and others were smuggled in by the U.S. side later. These radio receivers were all hidden in the tents of the "Regiment Headquarters" or the "Principal" of the "CIE School."

    远东美军“CIE”特务组织是特务分子破坏活动的指挥者
    朝中方面已掌握确凿证据，证明远东美军的“CIE”特务组织指挥着东场里战俘营场中的国民党特务进行破坏解释工作的活动。
    印度看管部队在十一月七日截获的一架美国军用无线电收报机，已经证明是由臭名昭著的远东美军的特务组织“CIE”偷运给营场中的特务的。根据中立国遣返委员会给朝中方面的信件，这架无线电收报机是今年九月在东京包装的，收报机上面标着：陆军八二三九部队第一广播出版队（前译为第一广播和传单组），军邮五百号。现在已经得到证据，第一广播出版队就是“CIE”特务组织。最近遣返归来的一个中国人民志愿军被俘人员，从营场里带出来一本晏阳初编的称为“平民十字课”的书。这本书第一页的左下方，印有中文字：“美军远东驻军第一广播出版队（前民间新闻教育处）”。在正上方印有英文字：“1ST RADIO BROADCAST AND LEAFLET GROUP（FORMERLY CIAND E）US ARMED FORCES FAREAST”。事实非常清楚，偷运无线电收报机给特务分子，指挥他们破坏解释工作和强迫扣留战俘罪恶活动的就是远东美军的“CIE”特务组织。但是，据合众社报道，在十一月十三日中立国遣返委员会谴责美方偷运无线电收报机给特务分子以后，美方在写给中立国遣返委员会的信中还厚颜无耻地说，它不知道关于无线电收报机的事情。
    据遣返归来的我方被俘人员报告：东场里战俘营场里的“CIE学校”是蒋匪特务布置破坏解释工作和迫害战俘罪恶活动的中心。蒋匪特务头子“第一联队”的“联队长”王顺清就是“第一联队”
  “CIE学校”的“校长”。这种“CIE”特务组织是原封不动地从美方战俘营里搬进来的。早在一九五一年秋，东京美军总部派遣很多美国军官到巨济岛的美方战俘营内成立“CIE学校”，并由台湾蒋匪派来许多特务担任“学校”的“教官”。这种所谓“学校”实际上是美蒋特务对战俘强制进行法西斯教育，强迫战俘刺字、写血书、“甄别”的恐怖组织。在停战协定即将签字之时，美军当局就积极部署把这种特务组织搬进中立国看管营场。归来的志愿军被俘人员王旭说：七月十九日，东京美军总部心理作战处负责人汉生和“CIE”的负责人奥斯门曾到济州岛战俘营里，他们在“大队长”以上的会议上公开说，原来在战俘营中的“CI E”工作人员、“神父”、“牧师”、“法师”及战俘营的管理人员都将与战俘一道到中立区去。许多归来的我方被俘人员证明，“CIE”的蒋匪特务“马老师”、“吴老师”、“朱老师”等都混进了中立国看管营场。“马老师”就以“翻译”的名义混在美方第六十四野战医院中继续指挥特务进行破坏活动。
    据归来的我方被俘人员报告：中立国看管营场里的“CIE学校”所进行的破坏解释工作的活动，第一是强制对战俘进行反动教育，恫吓和欺骗他们不得要求遣返。战俘在巨济岛、济州岛上时每周被迫“听课”四个到六个小时，现在每天要“听课”五个小时。每天吹号以后，“警备队员”就拿着棒子到各个帐篷去搜查，强迫战俘“听课”。谁不去“听课”，就要遭到殴打。谁不安静“听课”，就要被拖到讲台上罚站。“教官”由“大队部”的
  “CIE”“教育股长”担任，课本由东京美军“CIE”总部供给。
    第二是布置破坏解释工作，强迫战俘进行演习，要战俘背诵由美军“CIE”组织印发的“质问共产党解释代表”的一百多个诬蔑性“问题”。归来的志愿军被俘人员何天隆说，八月下旬来东场里以前，他亲眼看见美国兵用吉普车把印好的“问题”送到第三联队“CIE学校”“校长”张遵贤那里去，然后由他分发给各大队、中队和小队，由“CIE”组织的大队“教育股长”，中队的“教育委员”强迫战俘演习。在解释工作进行时，特务分子就用这些“问题”来纠缠解释代表，拖延解释时间。
    第三是强迫战俘进行反对解释、反对印度看管部队和中立国遣返委员会的“示威”游行。游行所用的标语及口号是由美军“CIE”组织拟发的。归来的志愿军被俘人员王旭说，他在来东场里以前，曾在蒋匪特务张遵贤那里看到用英文打字机打好的四十七条口号，张遵贤告诉他说，这是“CI E”的蒋匪特务“马老师”发给他的。后来，他把这些口号译成中文后发给特务供书写标语和喊口号之用。
    第四是监视和谋杀想回国的战俘。据归来的志愿军被俘人员常中信说：第二十八号营场的蒋匪特务“大队长”张宇旺在谋杀张子龙以前，曾写信给蒋匪特务头子“CIE学校”的“校长”张遵贤请示。谋杀张子龙的主犯之一就是第二十八号营场的
  “CIE”“教育股长”施云。归来的我方被俘人员说：“CIE学校”的蒋匪特务由无线电收报机接受美方破坏解释工作的指示。这些无线电收报机一部分是蒋匪特务混进营场时带进去的，另一部分是美方后来偷运进去的。这些无线电收报机都藏在
  “联队部”或“CIE学校”“校长”的帐篷内。
