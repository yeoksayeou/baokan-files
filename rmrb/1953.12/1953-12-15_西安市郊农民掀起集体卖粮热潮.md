Farmers in the Suburbs of Xi'an Launch a Collective Grain Selling Upsurge

    After more than 3,000 cadres conducted in-depth publicity of the general line, a patriotic collective grain selling upsurge was launched in the rural areas of the suburbs of Xi'an. In the first ten days of this month, the farmers have already organized and delivered the first batch of nearly 600,000 jin of surplus grain to the grain stations. In those days, the snow in the suburbs had not yet melted, and the cold wind was biting, but on the avenues leading to the grain purchasing stations, collective grain selling convoys holding red flags, beating gongs and drums, and performing Yangko dances passed by from time to time. On the 7th, the farmers of Xicun, Hongmiaopo in the 11th district, "fired the first shot" and collectively sold more than 10,000 jin of wheat. From the 9th to the 12th, the farmers in each township of the district were unwilling to lag behind, and collectively sold nearly 200,000 jin of surplus grain one after another. The grain selling upsurge then spread to other districts. On the 12th, the farmers in the 9th district also collectively sold more than 90,000 jin. That night, the farmers in the 12th district filled grain bags and loaded vehicles all night long, and adorned their livestock with silk and tassels. Early the next morning, 159 carts loaded with more than 290,000 jin of grain formed a convoy as long as five li on the West Gate Avenue, heading towards the grain station in a mighty and impressive manner. The patriotic grain selling enthusiasm of the farmers in the suburbs of Xi'an has won the warm praise of the people of the city. When the grain selling convoys passed by, workers, soldiers, citizens, students, and cadres gathered on both sides of the avenue to applaud, cheer, and wave to the convoys. When the grain selling convoy of the 11th district passed by the Xi'an Municipal People's Government on the 11th, Deputy Mayor Zhang Fengbo specially came out to welcome them and made a brief speech, expressing his respect for the farmers' patriotic enthusiasm. The grain selling convoy also gave Deputy Mayor Zhang a letter, which read: "After listening to the publicity of the general line of the state's transition period, we all unanimously support it and guarantee to sell all surplus grain to the state to support the state's industrial construction."

    西安市郊农民掀起集体卖粮热潮
    经过三千多名干部深入宣传总路线后，西安市郊区农村掀起了爱国集体卖粮的热潮。本月上旬，农民们已把第一批近六十万斤余粮有组织地送进了粮站。那几天，市郊积雪未消，寒风凛冽，但在通往粮食收购站的大道上，不时通过举着红旗、敲着锣鼓、扭着秧歌的集体卖粮车队。七日，十一区红庙坡西村农民打了“头一炮”，集体卖出小麦一万多斤。九日至十二日，该区各乡农民不甘落后，先后集体卖出近二十万斤余粮，卖粮热潮跟着扩展到其他各区。十二日，九区农民也集体卖出九万多斤。当天晚上，十二区农民通夜灌粮装车，给牲口挂绸戴套，第二天一早，一百五十九辆大车装上了二十九万多斤粮食，在西关大道上摆成足有五里长的队伍，一行行、一溜溜、浩浩荡荡奔向粮站。西安市郊区农民的爱国卖粮热情，获得了全市人民的热烈赞扬。当卖粮车队通过时，工人、士兵、市民、学生、干部便拥集在大道两旁向车队鼓掌、欢笑、挥手。十一区卖粮车队在十一日路过西安市人民政府门口时，张锋伯副市长特地出来欢迎，并作了简短的讲话，对农民们的爱国热情表示敬意。卖粮车队还交给了张副市长一封信，信上写着：“我们听了国家过渡时期总路线的宣传后，都一致拥护，保证把全部余粮卖给国家，来支援国家工业建设。”
