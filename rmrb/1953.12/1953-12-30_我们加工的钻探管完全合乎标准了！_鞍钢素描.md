    "The drilling pipes we processed are completely up to standard!"
    — Sketch of Anshan Iron and Steel

In the past, they were all rural girls who did not understand industrial production. After six or seven months of learning, they have mastered the operating technology of new lathes. The threads on the first batch of drilling pipes they manufactured have been proven by inspection to be completely up to standard.
