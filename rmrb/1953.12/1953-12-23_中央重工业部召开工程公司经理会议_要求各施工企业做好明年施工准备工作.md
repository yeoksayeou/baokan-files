    The Central Ministry of Heavy Industry recently convened a meeting of engineering company managers to arrange for construction preparation work for 1954. From now until the start of construction next year, construction enterprises must do the following: First, organize the construction organization according to next year's tasks and equip it with a backbone force; focus on establishing a production area management system so that the leaders at all levels of production areas know what to do, what responsibilities to bear, and how to do it. If this work is done well, the construction team will be able to "go to the construction site with a system of responsibility," avoiding chaos at the start of construction. Second, train cadres by summarizing experience. The training targets are construction site directors, chief engineers, and foremen in construction; engineering plan section chiefs and dispatchers in planning management; a group of economic accounting personnel, including the financial and material section chiefs of both parties, in financial work; and engineering and technical personnel conferences to summarize technical management experience and discuss major technical issues in technical management. All this is to establish the ongoing work of construction enterprises. In addition, the construction organization design and the annual plan of the construction enterprise should be compiled so that next year's work is orderly and begins to proceed according to the principles of economic accounting.
    At this meeting, Soviet expert Kolekseva also introduced the important significance of the one-man management system and the organizational structure of Soviet construction and installation enterprises, and explained the main responsibilities of various functional personnel in site organization. Anshan Iron and Steel Rolling Mill Engineering Company, the engineering company directly under the Ministry of Heavy Industry, and Anshan Iron and Steel Electromechanical Installation Engineering Company, among others, introduced their organizational structures and experiences in promoting the basic-level administrative responsibility system.

    中央重工业部召开工程公司经理会议
    要求各施工企业做好明年施工准备工作
    中央重工业部最近召开了工程公司经理会议，布置了一九五四年施工准备工作。从现在起到明年开工，各施工企业要做好以下几件工作：一、根据明年任务把施工机构组织起来，把骨干力量配备齐全；着重地把生产区域管理制建立起来，让各级生产区域的负责人知道要做什么事，负什么责任，怎样干法。这个工作做好了，就能使施工队伍“带着责任制走上工地”，避免开始施工时发生混乱现象。二、采取总结经验的方式，训练干部。训练的对象，在施工方面为工地主任、总工长和工长；计划管理方面为工程计划科长和调度员；在财务工作方面，训练一批经济核算人员，包括甲、乙方的财务和材料科长；在技术管理方面，举行工程技术人员会议，总结技术管理经验，讨论一些重大技术问题。这些都是为了把施工企业的经常工作建立起来。此外，还要把施工组织设计和施工企业年度计划编制出来，使明年工作有次序地并开始按经济核算的原则进行。
    在这个会议上，还由苏联专家珂列克谢娃介绍了关于一长制的重要意义和苏联建筑安装企业组织机构的情况，并对工地组织中各职能人员的主要职责作了说明。鞍钢轧钢工程公司、重工业部直属工程公司，鞍钢机电安装工程公司等单位，分别介绍了各该单位的组织机构及推行基层行政责任制的体会。
