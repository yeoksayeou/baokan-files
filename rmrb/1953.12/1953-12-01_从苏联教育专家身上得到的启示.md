    Inspiration Gained from Soviet Education Experts
    Ding Haochuan
    Since the summer vacation of 1950, seven Soviet experts have come to work at Beijing Normal University. In their work, they have all demonstrated the characteristics of Soviet people with a communist attitude towards labor and internationalist spirit. They have given us theoretical guidance and specific help in the teaching of educational science and other majors. They have provided us with invaluable suggestions on general education reform. They have also cultivated, and are cultivating, new types of educational work cadres who meet the needs of national construction. In particular, it should be pointed out that each of them has set an example for us as people's teachers and people's education workers.
    
    Work According to Plan
    In September 1950, when Soviet education expert Karpova, pre-school education expert Gorina, and biology expert Suijina had just decided to come to work at Beijing Normal University, the Central Ministry of Education notified the school to send some comrades to meet with the experts. At that time, we thought that the first meeting "should" be a few words of greeting, to get to know each other; as for work, that would be later. Therefore, we went into the experts' office of the Central Ministry of Education with a careless attitude. Who knew, after a simple introduction of names and positions by the translator, we were divided into three groups for conversation. My counterpart was Comrade Karpova. After she sat down, she spread her notebook on the table, holding a pencil in her hand, and asked item by item. She asked how many teachers and students there were in the Education Department of Beijing Normal University, how many classes there were, etc. When I answered accurately, a pleasant and satisfied look appeared on her face; if the answer was a little vague, the other party would ask one question after another. After the question and answer came to a conclusion, I hoped to end this kind of "examination" as soon as possible, just like a student who usually doesn't study hard and is ashamed to escape the examination room after a failed exam. Who knew that after a pause, Comrade Karpova asked me a question that made me even more embarrassed: "Comrade Ding, what do you want me to do?" To this question, I had to bite the bullet and say: "I haven't considered it yet." Immediately afterwards, she took out a piece of paper full of words from her bag and said to me: "I have drafted a work plan myself, and I request your approval!" She had roughly planned the work items she wanted to do and the time to complete each item. I could not raise any objections to such a plan she proposed, so I could only say: "Let's discuss the work later!"
    
    The first meeting with the Soviet experts profoundly educated me: leaders must grasp the specific situation, and work must be planned. Work without a plan is like a ship without a direction, not knowing where it will drift.
    
    No Trivial Matters in Education
    Once, after seeing the roll call situation in a middle school class, Soviet expert Pushkin raised the following question:
    "Checking the number of people in the classroom is mainly to check the absence. Why waste class time calling out the names of those who are present one by one?"
    He told us: in the Soviet Union, the class's responsible students usually check the names of the absentees before class, list them, and put them on the teacher's desk; after the teacher looks at it, he marks the names of the absentees in his handbook. This is to understand the students' absence situation, and to provide supplementary lessons for the absent students later.
    
    The Soviet school's method of checking attendance reflects the spirit of the teacher's leading role and the teacher responsibility system consistently advocated in communist pedagogy and the Soviet education system. The teacher's responsibility is not to objectively record the students' learning situation and learning achievements, but to be responsible for making the students understand (of course, this should not be understood as the teacher replacing the students' learning, or neglecting to cultivate students' independent work ability).
    
    In guiding students in education internships, Soviet experts pointed out: a teacher must pay attention to blackboard writing, hanging charts, drawing, and other "trivial matters" that many people regard as "purely technical." If the teacher's blackboard writing is sloppy, it will make students develop the habit of sloppy writing; if a picture is hung crookedly, it will affect the cultivation of students' serious and earnest attitude; if an equal sign in a formula is not neat, parallel, or of appropriate length, it will affect the students' attitude towards scientific knowledge; if a map of a region is drawn without drawing a larger map at the same time to indicate the location of this region, it will cause students to understand this region in isolation, and thus fail to get a correct understanding.
    
    From here, we can see that educating the next generation is a very detailed work. Every teacher should not be careless about any details. Every small action will leave its mark on the students' character and understanding. We must earnestly and responsibly shape the souls of our next generation – the builders of socialism and communism.
    
    Those Who Do Education Work Should Study Pedagogy
    In June of this year, when the students of the Education Department were interning at Tongxian Normal School in Hebei, they organized a demonstration class on "Pedagogy" under the guidance of expert Cuikov. The students of the Education Department, the principals of several middle schools in Tongxian, and teacher representatives attended the class. At the evaluation meeting, a middle school teacher declared that he was a "layman" and "did not understand pedagogy" when he spoke. Comrade Cuikov made a conclusion, solemnly stating at the beginning: "Just now a teacher said in his speech that he does not understand pedagogy and is an 'outsider' to pedagogy. This is a noteworthy issue." He then pointed out that Soviet pedagogy is the Marxist-Leninist science about educating the younger generation, and it is a science that every teacher must understand and learn.
    
    Many comrades who do education work, and even many comrades who teach in normal schools and normal colleges, do not understand pedagogy. Indeed, this is mainly because we did not have the opportunity to learn scientific pedagogy in the past, or did not realize the necessity of learning pedagogy, but the situation today should be different. The serious task of cultivating the next generation according to the principles of educational science in a planned and serious manner has been placed before us.
    
    Some people think that studying pedagogy is only the business of teachers who teach pedagogy, and those who teach Chinese or natural sciences do not need to study it; or they think that it is still necessary for primary and secondary school teachers to learn pedagogy, but it does not matter much whether university teachers learn it or not; others think that those who do teaching work should study it, but it is not necessary for those who are in charge of educational administrative work. These understandings are all incorrect.
    
    Protect the Prestige of Teachers
    Also on the day when the pedagogy demonstration class was held at Tongxian Normal School.
    Comrade Cuikov carefully pointed out the advantages of the teacher in charge and the roots of the shortcomings when making the conclusion of the evaluation meeting, and seriously analyzed the shortcomings themselves. At this time, the bell rang, and students flocked towards the door and outside the windows of the classroom in groups of three or five.
    
    Seeing this situation, Comrade Cuikov immediately stopped speaking, walked down from the podium, and told the translator to ask the school leaders present to ask the students to leave. Only when no students remained outside the windows did Comrade Cuikov go back to the stage to continue speaking.
    
    Soviet experts told us: do not criticize the shortcomings of teachers in public, especially not in front of students. If teachers have mistakes or shortcomings, they should be criticized and corrected, but this should be done in individual conversations. In any case, teachers should not be criticized in front of students.
    
    Although the specific situation in our China is still different from that of Soviet schools, the expert's words are of great enlightenment to us: because in general, our respect for teachers shows that we respect knowledge and respect teachers' labor. This is not only necessary to encourage teachers' enthusiasm for work, but also necessary to cultivate healthy morals in the next generation.

    从苏联教育专家身上得到的启示
    丁浩川
    从一九五○年暑假后到现在，先后有七位苏联专家来到北京师范大学工作。他们在工作中都以共产主义的劳动态度和国际主义精神显示了苏维埃人的特点。他们在教育科学和其它专业的教学上给我们以理论的指导和具体的帮助，他们在一般的教育改革上给我们提供了十分宝贵的建议，他们还为我们培养了、并正在培养着新型的、合乎国家建设需要的教育工作干部。特别应该指出的是：他们每个人都为我们树立了人民教师和人民教育工作者的榜样。
    要按计划办事
    一九五○年九月，当苏联教育学专家卡尔波娃、学前教育专家戈林娜和生物学专家绥吉娜刚决定到北京师范大学来工作的时候，中央教育部通知学校方面派几位同志去和专家见面。当时我们想，第一次见面，“照理”应该是寒暄几句，认识认识；至于工作，那是以后的事。所以，我们就以满不在乎的心情跑进中央教育部的专家办公室里。谁知，经过翻译同志简单介绍了一下姓名职务之后，便分三组对谈。我的对方是卡尔波娃同志。她坐下来之后就把笔记本摊在桌上，手里拿着铅笔，一项一项地问起来。她问到北京师范大学教育系有多少教师，有多少学生，分多少班级，……。当我回答得准确时，对方的脸上显出了愉快的满意的神色；如果回答得有些含糊，对方就一句接一句地追问。问答告了一个段落，我希望尽快地结束这样的“考问”，像一个平常不用功的学生经过了一番失败的考试羞愧得急于逃出考场一样。谁知道停了一歇之后，卡尔波娃同志向我提出了一个使我更加狼狈的问题：“丁同志，你准备要我做什么工作？”对于这一个问题，我只好硬着头皮说：“我还没有考虑。”紧接着，她就从皮包里取出了一张写满了字的纸，对我说：“我自己拟了一个工作计划，请求你的同意！”她把她要做的工作项目，每项工作完成的时间，都大体上规划好了。对于她提出的这样的计划，我提不出任何意见，只能说：“关于工作，以后再商量吧！”
    跟苏联专家的第一次会见，深刻地教育了我：领导人要掌握具体情况，做工作要有计划。工作如果没有计划，就好像一只没有方向的船，不晓得要飘流到那里去。
    教育工作无琐事
    有一次，苏联专家普希金看到一个中学上课点名的情况以后，这样地提出了问题：
    “在课堂上检查人数，主要是为了检查缺席的情况，为什么反要把出席的人一个一个地叫起来浪费上课的时间呢？”
    他告诉我们：在苏联，学校里通常都是由班级的负责同学在上课前把缺席人的姓名查清楚，开列名单，放在教师的讲桌上；教师看了以后，就在自己的手册上把缺课人的名字打上记号。这一方面是为了了解学生的缺勤情况，一方面是为了以后给缺课的学生补课。
    苏联学校检查缺勤情况的办法，体现着共产主义教育学和苏联教育制度中所一贯主张的教师的主导作用和教师负责制的精神。教师的责任不是客观主义地去记录学生的学习情况和学习成绩，而是要负责把学生教懂（当然，这不应该理解为教师要替代学生学习，或忽视培养学生的独立工作能力）。
    在指导学生进行教育实习的过程中，苏联专家指出：一个教师一定要注意板书、挂图、画图这类被很多人看成“纯技术”的“琐事”。如果教师的板书潦草，会使得学生养成写字潦草的习惯；一张图挂得不端正，会影响到学生严肃认真的态度的培养；算式中一个等号画得不整齐、不平行、不长短适度，会影响到学生对于科学知识的态度；画一个地区的地图，而不同时画一个更大范围的地图来指明这一地区的位置，则会使学生孤立地来认识这一地区，因而不能得到正确的理解。
    从这里我们可以看到：教育下一代是一个十分细致的工作，每一个做教师的人对于任何细节都不应马虎大意，每一个细小的动作都会在学生的性格和认识上打下它的烙印，一定要认真负责地来塑造我们下一代——社会主义和共产主义的建设者的灵魂。
    做教育工作的要学教育学
    今年六月，教育系同学在河北通县师范实习时，在崔可夫专家指导下组织了一次“教育学”的观摩课。出席听课的有教育系同学，通县几个中学的校长和教师代表。在举行评议会的时候，一位中学教师在发言时声明自己是“外行”，“并不懂教育学”。崔可夫同志做结论时，一开头就郑重地提出：“刚才有一位教师在发言中说他不懂教育学，对教育学是‘门外汉’，这是一个值得注意的问题。”紧接着他指出：苏维埃教育学是关于教育年青一代的马克思列宁主义科学，是每一位教师所必须了解学习的科学。
    很多做教育工作的同志，甚至很多在师范学校、师范学院教书的同志，是并不懂教育学的。诚然，这主要是由于过去我们没有学习科学的教育学的机会，或者没有认识到学习教育学的必要，但是今天的情形，总应该有所不同了。有计划地认真地、按照教育科学的原理来培养下一代的严重任务，已经摆在我们面前。
    有些人认为，学教育学那只是教教育学的教师的事，教语文或自然科学的人就不必去学习；或者认为，中小学教师学教育学还有必要，大学教师学不学就没有多大关系；又有人认为，做教学工作的人应该学习，而担负教育行政工作的人则并非必要。这些认识都是不对的。
    保护教师的威信
    也是在通县师范举行教育学观摩课的那一天。
    崔可夫同志在做评议会的结论时，很细致地指出了任课教师的优点，也指出了缺点产生的根源，而对于缺点本身则严正地做了分析。这时，下课钟打响了，同学们三五成群地向这间教室的门口、窗外涌来。
    崔可夫同志看到这种情形，立刻就停止了发言，从讲台走下来，告诉翻译，请在座的学校负责人要同学走开去。一直到没有一个同学停留在窗外时，崔可夫同志才又走上台去继续发言。
    苏联专家告诉我们：不要在公众的场合，特别是不要当着学生的面来指责教师的缺点。教师如有错误、缺点，应该予以批评、指正，但这应该是在个别谈话时，无论如何，不应该当着学生的面批评教师。
    虽然，我们中国的具体情况和苏联学校的情况还有所不同，但是专家的话对于我们却有很大的启发：因为在一般情况下，我们对于教师的尊重，表示我们尊重知识，尊重教师的劳动。这不仅在鼓励教师工作的积极性上是必要的，而且在培养下一代的健康的品德上也是必要的。
