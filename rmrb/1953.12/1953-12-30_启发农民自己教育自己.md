    Since the large-scale promotion of the General Line began in the vast rural areas of the country, the thinking of rural work cadres at all levels and the broad masses of peasants has undergone great changes. Many people feel enlightened, their direction is clear, and their work is energetic. The great truths of socialism are inextricably linked with the real life of the masses, turning into a tremendous material force. This force is driving forward grain purchases, agricultural production, and the mutual aid and cooperation movement; it is motivating more and more rural cadres and peasants to consciously transform their thinking, consciously abandon the capitalist road, and choose the socialist road.
    In this large-scale publicity and education work, various localities are constantly enriching the content of publicity and education, and have created and used a variety of vivid and effective methods and approaches. In addition to helping peasants calculate detailed accounts, some places have also organized peasants to recall and compare, which has also achieved good results. During the Liberation War and the land reform, inspiring the masses to recall and speak out about their suffering was one of the important methods to raise the masses' class consciousness and fighting enthusiasm. Under the leadership, organization, and inspiration of the Communist Party, the working people used concrete facts from their own experiences and vivid language they could understand to educate themselves, turning centuries of hatred into an invincible force, and achieving the great victory of the People's Liberation War and the anti-feudal struggle. Today, as long as the Party organization pays attention to guiding, gradually improving the ideological content of the recollections, gradually adding to its content of class education, gradually deepening its socialist content, and preventing and correcting deviations at any time, guiding it in the right direction, this method of inspiring the masses to carry out self-education can still be adopted. Of course, today the basic suffering of the Chinese people has been removed, the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucrat-capital in China has been overthrown by the people, and political power is firmly in the hands of the people. The Communist Party and the people's regime have already brought many blessings to the peasants and are still creating greater and everlasting happiness for the people of the whole country. At this time, when people compare the past suffering with the improvement of their current lives, they will be more enthusiastic about the cause of national construction; from recalling the past road they have traveled to looking forward to the future, they will also be more full of confidence in the cause of building socialism. At a time when real life has taken a big step forward and the road ahead is even clearer, inspiring peasants to recall the past suffering will cause deeper and broader ideological changes than past accusations, making them more determined to abandon all plans to take the old road, and more courageous to overcome all difficulties, work hard, and constantly move forward on the new road of common prosperity.
    In the publicity and education work of the General Line, what should we inspire the peasants to recall and compare? There are mainly the following three things:
    The first is to recall and denounce the suffering that imperialism and all reactionary forces of the old society inflicted on the peasants, and to compare it with the benefits that the state, the Party, the working class, the People's Liberation Army, and the Volunteers have given to the peasants since liberation. The purpose of guiding the masses to recall and compare this matter is to make everyone further understand the importance of a strong people's regime, the importance of consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, and the importance of national industrialization. The exhibition on publicizing the General Line in Guowangdu Village, Anyang, Henan, used pictures to show that before liberation, the masses suffered from the trampling and exploitation of imperialism and the Kuomintang, living a miserable life of poverty, hunger, and worse than animals. It was drawn here: in 1937, Japanese devils killed twenty-five peasants in this village with machine guns in one go, and five others were injured. The father of peasant Guo Zhenyu and the son of Yao Fude in this village were both killed in this massacre. Here it is drawn: Blockade ditches and blockhouses surround the village, and the masses are anxious and cannot go to the fields to produce. There is also: in 1946, bandit Wang Ziquan disregarded the life and death of the people and set fire to most of the wheat that the masses in Houjie had already harvested in the field, forcing 80% of the masses to flee famine and beg for food. Guo Zhenyu, whose father was killed by the Japanese devils, is working here as an explainer. With tears in his eyes, he told of the past disasters with grief and indignation. After visiting this exhibition, a rural woman, Hu Xiuying, said: "If my father hadn't been killed by the Japanese devils, how could I have become a child bride at the age of eight!" Why did we suffer such bullying in the past? It was because there was no strong people's democratic regime at that time, no people's own country. Now we already have a people's democratic regime, and we are the masters of this regime; we must build our country into a strong country, we must develop national industry, and we must strive to consolidate national defense. Guo Zhenyu's mother had already sold many grains to the state. After visiting the exhibition, recalling the situation of her husband being killed and thinking about the current good times, she decided to save another three hundred catties of grain to sell to the state. Then more than thirty households sold 6,700 catties of grain, and many farmers were still preparing to sell grain. At the exhibition recently held in the first district of Guanyang County, Guangxi, paintings were exhibited showing the great losses brought to the people of the whole country and the people of the area by Japanese imperialism in the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan. The narrator explained to the masses the great victory of our War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, and also explained that US imperialism is still constantly planning to invade us again. After everyone saw the pictures, listened to the explanations, and saw the exhibits about the relationship between industry and agriculture, the relationship between selling grain and prices, etc., the enthusiasm for selling grain to support national construction and expand production became even higher. They said: Without a strong country, everything is empty! The suffering that the old society gave to the peasants is endless. Many peasants recalled the tragic scenes of thousands and hundreds of people starving to death when there was a famine before liberation, and those who survived wandering everywhere; compared to this, although some places also suffered disasters after liberation, because there was a people's government and the state controlled the grain, the situation of surviving the famine was very different. Many rural cadres and masses recalled all kinds of hard days they had personally experienced in the discussion of the General Line, remembering how their lives had become better day by day under the leadership of the Communist Party. Many people said: In the past, they never dreamed that they would have surplus grain to sell today. After recalling and complaining about the suffering, the idea of ​​always following the Communist Party and the idea of ​​the worker-peasant alliance became more solid, and the enthusiasm for supporting industrial construction and consolidating national defense became even greater.
    The second is to recall and denounce the suffering that unscrupulous merchants and usurers inflicted on the peasants, and to compare it with the help that state-owned commerce, cooperatives, and state banks provided to the peasants; to compare the disadvantages of selling agricultural products to unscrupulous merchants with the benefits of selling agricultural products to the state. This is an important link in drawing a clear line between rural cadres and peasants and capitalism, and in raising socialist ideological awareness. Expanded meetings of district and township cadres in Songjiang County, Jiangsu, training classes for mutual aid team leaders in Xishui, Hubei, and many villages in various places carried out such accusations, and achieved good results. In addition to exposing how unscrupulous merchants and usurers colluded with the Kuomintang and landlords to defraud peasants and create the pain of "cheap grain hurts farmers" and "bumper harvests become disasters" before liberation, they also focused on accusing unscrupulous merchants and usurers of continuing to rush to buy grain, loaning green seedlings, hoarding, disrupting the market, and harming national construction and the interests of the people after liberation. In five villages in Dongjing Township, Chengdong District, Songjiang County, farmers borrowed more than 110 million yuan in usury from unscrupulous merchants this spring, and repaid more than 180 million yuan after the autumn harvest. Unscrupulous merchants loaned more than 400 million yuan of "green seedlings" in Dongjing Township alone, asking farmers for 500,000 to 600,000 catties of rice. After this account was calculated, the township cadres were shocked and said: "We have been busy increasing production all year round, but we never thought that the rice produced by more than 10,000 mu of land would flow into the hands of unscrupulous merchants!" Many farmers in Hubei Province said: In the past, speculative merchants controlled the grain, and grain prices rose and fell three times a year: we harvested rice in July, and it fell once; we bought New Year goods and repaid debts in December and sold grain, and it fell again; we harvested wheat in April and May, and it fell again; after the wheat was sold, grain prices rose; we lacked grain in the first month of the lunar year, and it rose again; we wanted to buy rice seedlings in April, and it rose again. Three rises and three falls, the rich are all unscrupulous merchants, and the losers are all farmers. After such accusations, rural cadres and peasants realized that usury and speculative merchants are two poisonous snakes that poison farmers, and we must cut off the long tails of usurers and speculative merchants wrapped around farmers so that we can live a good life. Everyone realized that if the state did not control the grain, and there were no state-owned commercial and supply and marketing cooperatives, farmers would suffer even more losses; no matter how much grain farmers produced, the benefits would still fall into the pockets of unscrupulous merchants and usurers. After such accusations, many farmers righteously refused the temptation of unscrupulous merchants and refuted the instigation of unscrupulous merchants; many people examined that they should not have been greedy for small profits and sold grain to unscrupulous merchants, and should not have "lifted a rock to hit their own feet"; they should not have hoarded grain and not sold it, unknowingly helping unscrupulous merchants. Therefore, everyone consciously and enthusiastically sold the surplus grain to the state. Some rural cadres who had previously lent usury and hoarded grain and sold grain tearfully examined their mistakes. Some said: "We used to be exploited, but now we are exploiting others in a muddled way." Everyone is determined to wash away the capitalist dirt on their bodies and stand up straight to lead the masses to take the socialist road.
    The third is to inspire peasants to use local or even personal examples to illustrate that the small-scale peasant economy cannot fundamentally rid peasants of poverty, and to compare it with the existing benefits of mutual aid and cooperation to peasants. This is to enable rural cadres and peasants to understand that the small-scale peasant economy is extremely unstable; without transforming the small-scale peasant economy, peasants can never completely get rid of poverty; allowing the small-scale peasant economy to develop "freely" will inevitably give birth to capitalism, causing most peasants to fall into even more painful situations; only by taking the bright road of socialism can all peasants become prosperous. Many places have done this, and the effect is also very good. For example, at the expanded meeting of district and township cadres in Songjiang County, Jiangsu, the discussion focused on how peasants suffered a lot because of decentralized management and weak strength; sometimes it seemed that they could live a slightly stable life, but they could not withstand natural and man-made disasters, "three illnesses, one emptiness." Everyone realized that the decentralized, backward small-scale peasant economy is the root of poverty; some people said: "If the root of poverty is not uprooted, it will definitely sprout!" Like Zheng Zhili, a farmer in Zhengjia Village, Chengxi District, Songjiang County, was a hired peasant before liberation. During the land reform, he was allocated thirteen mu of land, one room, and one bed. In 1951, he joined the mutual aid team, and the average yield per mu of land reached 600 catties of rice. In 1952, he withdrew from the team and worked independently. His wife fell ill during the busy farming season, and the rice was not planted in time. As a result, he only harvested 350 catties per mu, owed 300,000 yuan, and lacked two months of rations; in 1953, interest was added to the interest, and he owed more than 1 million yuan, so he had to sell the bed and work part-time again. Similar things happen everywhere. As long as the unstable facts of the small-scale peasant economy are clarified, and then compared with the fact that mutual aid and cooperative organizations increase agricultural production and increase farmers' income, farmers are willing to take the bright road of mutual aid and cooperation.
    When conducting these three types of recall and comparison, there must be correct leadership and a clear purpose. The purpose should be to enable rural cadres and peasants to draw a clear line between socialism and capitalism, raise socialist ideological awareness, and fight with full enthusiasm and consciously with practical actions to realize the General Line. It is neither to let the masses shed tears and vent their anger, nor is it to "struggle" against certain individual people, nor to "struggle" against certain individual people. It should be understood that the vast majority of rural cadres who have taken the capitalist road or want to develop towards the capitalist road are blind, because they have not been educated enough in the past, and they have not studied enough themselves, so they have lost their way. As for the general masses of peasants who do this, it is even more unconscious, and they must not be blamed. This part of the cadres and the masses should be enthusiastically helped; help them raise their awareness and actively strive for socialism. Especially when carrying out the second type of recall and comparison, attention should be paid to distinguishing between speculative thinking and speculative behavior, distinguishing between those who specialize in grain speculation and ordinary working peasants who have slightly speculative behavior, and not randomly "labeling" or attacking them, hindering the unity between peasants, and hindering the enthusiasm of peasants who seek to improve their lives from developing production in a legitimate way. It should also be emphasized that having more surplus grain is by no means a bad thing; as long as the surplus grain is obtained through hard work, the more surplus grain and the more grain sold, the more glorious it is. As long as attention is paid to grasping this point, there will be no deviations.
    Various places have already paid attention to "helping peasants calculate three accounts" (the benefits that the state, the Party, and the working class have given to the peasants since liberation; the benefits of selling agricultural products to the state; the benefits of mutual aid and cooperation), plus "leading peasants to recall three things" (the suffering that imperialism, landlords, and the Kuomintang gave to the peasants, the suffering that unscrupulous merchants and usurers gave to the peasants, and the fact that the small-scale peasant economy prevents peasants from finally getting rid of poverty), comparing the two, it can make the publicity of the General Line go deeper, and it can better achieve the purpose of "teaching peasants to do three things" (selling grain to the state, striving to increase production, developing mutual aid and cooperation) and "leading peasants to take one road" (the road of socialism). Whether it is helping peasants calculate accounts or leading peasants to recall and compare, various places have used a variety of methods. There are exhibitions (including pictures, photos, objects, and real people and real events, explanations by people who have experienced it), various discussion meetings (cadres, youth, elderly, women, military families, demobilized soldiers, etc.), large reports and typical reports (at cadre meetings, various representative meetings, or mass meetings), discussion meetings in newspapers (such as the discussion on the thinking of two rural cadres who began to degenerate and re-become good in Henan Daily and New Hunan Daily), visits (visiting factories, farms, rural areas with more serious class differentiation, etc.), and family visits; in addition, winter schools and various cultural and artistic activities are also closely combined with the publicity and education of the General Line. These methods can complement and assist each other. As long as the content is in line with the General Line and combined with reality, and the method is vivid and popular, the publicity work will definitely be done well. If the publicity work is done well, plus the necessary economic work, the socialist awareness of the peasants will definitely be further improved, and the socialist construction cause in the rural areas will definitely proceed more smoothly.

    启发农民自己教育自己
    在全国广大农村里开始大规模地宣传总路线以后，各级农村工作干部和广大农民群众的思想已有很大的改变。许多人感到眼光明亮了，方向明确了，工作有劲了。社会主义的大道理和群众的现实生活血肉不可分地联系了起来，变成了巨大的物质力量。这个力量正推动着购粮、农业生产和互助合作运动等项工作；推动着越来越多的农村干部和农民群众自觉地改造自己的思想，自觉地抛开资本主义的道路，选择了社会主义的道路。
    在这大规模的宣传教育工作中，各地不断充实着宣传教育的内容，创造了、运用了多种多样的生动有力的方式和方法。除了帮助农民算细账以外，有些地方还组织农民回忆、对比，也收到很好的效果。在解放战争中，在土地改革中，启发群众回忆、诉苦曾是提高群众的阶级觉悟和斗争热情的重要方法之一。在共产党的领导、组织、启发下，劳动人民用亲身经历的具体的事实和自己能懂的生动的语言教育了自己，把千百年来的仇恨化成了不可征服的力量，取得了人民解放战争和反封建斗争的伟大胜利。在今天，只要党组织注意加以引导，把回忆的思想内容逐步提高，逐步加多它的阶级教育的内容，逐步加深它的社会主义的内容，随时防止和纠正偏差，把它引导到正确的方向上去，这种启发群众进行自我教育的方式还是可以采用的。当然，今天我国人民的基本痛苦已经去掉了，帝国主义、封建势力和官僚资本在中国的反动统治已经被人民打倒，政权已经牢固地掌握在人民手里，共产党和人民政权已经带给农民许多幸福，还正在为全国人民创造更大的永远的幸福。在这时候，人们把过去的痛苦和当前生活的改善对比起来，就会对国家建设事业更加热爱；从回忆过去走过的道路到展望将来，也会对建设社会主义的事业更充满信心。在现实生活已经前进了一大步而且继续前进的道路已经更明确了的时候，启发农民再回忆一下过去的痛苦，就会比过去的诉苦引起更深更广的思想变化，会使农民更坚决地抛开走旧道路的一切打算，更勇敢地克服一切困难，艰苦奋斗，在大家一同富裕的新道路上不断前进。
    在总路线的宣传教育工作中，应该启发农民回忆、对比一些什么呢？主要的有以下三宗事情：
    第一宗是回忆和控诉帝国主义和旧社会的一切反动势力给农民的苦，和解放以来国家、党和工人阶级、解放军和志愿军给农民的利益作个对比。引导群众回忆、对比这宗事情的目的，是使大家进一步认识强大的人民政权的重要，巩固工农联盟的重要和国家工业化的重要。河南安阳郭王度村宣传总路线的展览会上，用图画表现出解放前群众受着帝国主义和国民党的蹂躏和压榨，过着贫困饥饿牛马不如的悲惨生活。这里画着：一九三七年日本鬼子
  一次用机枪就打死了这个乡村的二十五个农民，还有五个打伤了。本村农民郭振玉的父亲和姚富德的儿子，都是这一次被惨杀的。这里画着：封锁沟、炮楼包围着村子，群众干着急不能下地生产。还有：一九四六年匪军王自全不顾人民死活，把后街群众已经收到场里的麦子放火烧了大半，逼得百分之八十的群众逃荒要饭。父亲被日本鬼子打死了的郭振玉，就在这里做说明员。他满眼含泪，悲愤地讲述过去的灾难。参观了这次展览会后，一个农村妇女扈秀英说：“要不是我父亲被日本鬼子打死，我怎么能八岁上当童养媳！”为什么过去受这样的欺负呢？就因为那时候没有强大的人民民主政权，没有人民自己的国家。现在我们已经有了人民民主政权，自己就是这个政权的主人；我们就一定要把我们的国家建设成一个强大的国家，就一定要发展国家工业，就一定要努力巩固国防。郭振玉的母亲已经卖给国家许多粮食了，参观了展览会后想起丈夫被打死的情形，想想现在的好光景，决定再节约三百斤粮食卖给国家。接着就又有三十多户卖粮六千七百多斤，很多农民还在准备卖粮。广西灌阳县一区最近举办的展览会上，展览了日本帝国主义在八年侵华战争中给全国人民和该地人民带来的重大损失的图画，讲解员向群众说明了我们抗美援朝的伟大胜利，又说明了美帝国主义还在每天不断地打主意再来侵略我们。大家看了图画，听了讲解，又看了展览会上关于工业和农民的关系，卖粮和物价的关系等等陈列品，卖粮支援国家建设、扩大生产的热情就更加高涨了。他们说：没有强大的国家，什么都是空的！旧社会给农民的苦难是诉不尽的。许多农民回忆起解放以前闹灾荒的时候成千成百人饿死、活下的人到处流浪的悲惨景象；比起来，解放以后有的地方虽然也遭了灾，可是因为有了人民政府，国家掌握了粮食，渡荒的情形可就大不一样了。许多农村干部和群众在讨论总路线中都回忆到了过去亲自经历的种种苦日子，想起自己怎样在共产党领导下把日子过得一天比一天好了起来。许多人说：过去自己做梦也想不到今天会有余粮出卖。经过回忆诉苦以后，永远跟着共产党走的思想和工农联盟的思想更加坚固了，支援工业建设、巩固国防的劲头更大了。
    第二宗是回忆和控诉奸商、高利贷者给农民的苦，和国营商业、合作社、国家银行等对农民的帮助做个对比；把卖农产品给奸商的坏处和卖农产品给国家的好处做个对比。这是使农村干部和农民群众与资本主义划清界限，提高社会主义的思想觉悟的一个重要环节。江苏松江县区乡干部扩大会议、湖北浠水互助组长训练班和各地许多乡村都进行了这样的控诉，收到了很好的效果。他们除了揭发解放前奸商、高利贷者如何与国民党、地主勾结起来欺诈农民、造成“谷贱伤农”“丰收成灾”的痛苦以外，并且着重控诉了解放后奸商、高利贷者继续抢购粮食、放青苗债、囤积居奇、捣乱市场、危害国家建设和人民利益的种种事实。松江县城东区洞泾乡的五个村，农民今年春天向奸商借高利贷一亿一千多万元，秋收后付还一亿八千多万元。奸商只在洞泾乡就放了四亿多元的“青苗”，向农民要稻谷五六十万斤。这笔账算出来以后，乡干部都大吃一惊，说：“一年到头忙着搞增产，想不到一万多亩田增产的稻谷都要流到奸商手里去了！”湖北省许多农民都说：过去投机商人掌握了粮食，粮价一年三涨三跌：七月间我们收了稻子，一跌；腊月间我们办年货、还债要卖粮食，又一跌；四五月间我们收了麦子，又一跌；麦子卖完了，粮价就涨；正月间我们缺粮，又一涨；四月间我们要买栽秧米，又一涨。三涨三跌，发财的都是奸商，吃亏的都是农民。这样控诉了之后，农村干部和农民群众都认识了高利贷和投机商人是毒害农民的两条大毒蛇，一定要斩断高利贷者和投机商人缠在农民身上的长尾巴，我们才能过好日子。大家认识到，要是没有国家掌握粮食，没有国营商业和供销合作社，农民不知道更要多吃多少亏；农民打粮食再多，利益还是会落到奸商和高利贷者的腰包里去。经过这样的控诉以后，许多农民义正辞严地拒绝了奸商的引诱，驳斥了奸商的挑拨；许多人检讨了自己不该贪眼前的小便宜把粮食卖给了奸商，不该“搬起石头砸自己的脚”；不该囤粮不卖，不知不觉帮了奸商的忙。于是，大家就自觉地踊跃地把余粮卖给了国家。一部分过去放过高利贷和囤粮贩粮的农村干部痛器流涕地检讨了自己的错误。有的说：“我们过去受人剥削，现在糊糊涂涂又剥削起别人来了。”大家决心把自己身上的资本主义的污垢洗掉，挺起腰来领导群众走社会主义的路。
    第三宗是启发农民自己用本地以至本人的事例说明小农经济不能使农民从根本上摆脱贫困，和互助合作对农民已有的好处作个对比。这是为了使农村干部和农民群众了解：小农经济是极不稳定的；不改造小农经济，农民就永远也不能完全摆脱贫困；听任小农经济“自由”地发展，必然要生长出资本主义来，而使大多数农民陷入更加痛苦的境地；只有走社会主义的光明大路，才能使全体农民都富裕起来。不少地方这样做了，效果也很好。例如江苏松江县区乡干部扩大会议上，讨论了农民因为分散经营，力量薄弱，吃了许许多多苦；有时候虽然似乎也能稍安稳一些日子，可是经不起天灾人祸，“三场病，一场空”。大家认识了分散的、落后的小农经济是一条穷根；有的人说：“穷根不拔，一定要发芽！”像松江县城西区郑家?村农民郑志利，解放前是个雇农，土地改革时分进了十三亩土地、一间房、一张床。一九五一年参加互助组，平均每亩田产量达到六百斤谷。一九五二年退组单干，农忙时妻子病倒了，稻子没有及时种上，结果每亩只收了三百五十斤，负了三十万元债，缺了两个月口粮；一九五三年利上加利，已欠了一百多万元债，只好把床卖掉，自己又打零工去。类似的事情各地都有。只要把小农经济不稳定的事实弄清楚，再和互助合作组织使农业产量增加，农民收入增多的事实加以对比，农民是乐意走互助合作的光明大道的。
    进行这三宗事的回忆、对比时，都要有正确的领导，要有明确的目的。目的应当是使农村干部和农民划清社会主义和资本主义的界限，提高社会主义的思想觉悟，满腔热情地自觉地以实际行动为实现总路线而斗争。既不是让群众流流眼泪、发泄一下心头的愤恨就算完事，也不是为了“斗争”某些个别的人，也不要去“斗争”某些个别的人。要了解：农村干部走了资本主义的路或者想向资本主义的路发展的，绝大多数都是带有盲目性的，是因为过去对他们教育不够，他们自己学习也不够，以至迷失了方向。至于一般农民群众这样做的，就更是不自觉的，决不能责怪他们。对这一部分干部和群众，都应该热情地帮助；帮助他们提高觉悟，积极地为社会主义奋斗。特别是在进行第二种回忆、对比的时候，应当注意把投机思想和投机行为分别开，把专门进行粮食投机的分子和一般的稍有投机行为的劳动农民分别开，不可乱“戴帽子”，乱打击，妨碍农民之间的团结，妨碍正当的从发展生产中求改善生活的农民的积极性。还要强调说明：余粮多决不是什么不好的事情；只要余粮是勤劳生产得来的，余粮越多、卖粮越多就越光荣。只要注意掌握这一点，就不会发生偏差。
    各地已经都注意了“帮农民算三笔账”（解放以来国家、党和工人阶级给农民的利益；把农产品卖给国家的好处；互助合作的好处），再加上“引农民回忆三宗事”（帝国主义、地主和国民党给农民的苦，奸商和高利贷者给农民的苦，小农经济使农民不能最后地摆脱贫困），把两者对比起来，就可以使总路线的宣传更深入一步，就能更好地达到“教农民做三件事”（卖粮食给国家、努力增加生产、发展互助合作）、“领农民走一条路”（社会主义的路）的目的。不论是帮农民算账或是引农民回忆、对比，各地都运用了多种多样的方式。有展览会（包括图画、照片、实物和真人真事、现身说法的解说），有各种座谈会（干部、青年、老人、妇女、军属、退伍军人等），有大报告和典型报告（在干部会、各种代表会或群众会上），有报纸上的讨论会（如河南日报、新湖南报上对于开始蜕化和重新变好的两个农村干部的思想的讨论），有参观（参观工厂、农场、阶级分化比较严重的农村等），有家庭访问；此外，冬学和各种文艺活动也都和总路线的宣传教育密切地结合了起来。这些方式是能够互相补充、互相辅助的。只要内容是符合总路线而又结合实际的，方式是生动通俗的，宣传工作就一定能够做好。宣传工作做好了，再加上必要的经济工作，农民的社会主义觉悟就一定能更进一步提高，农村的社会主义建设事业就一定能更顺利地进行。
