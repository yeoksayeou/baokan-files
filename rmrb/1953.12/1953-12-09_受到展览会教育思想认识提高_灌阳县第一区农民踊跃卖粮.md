Guanyang County, Guangxi Province: The First District of Guanyang County has used exhibitions to promote the Party's General Line for the Transition Period to farmers and mobilize them to sell their surplus grain to the state, achieving preliminary success.

Starting from November 13th, the First District of Guanyang County used exhibitions to educate activists and key group farmers in each township about selling surplus grain to the state. Farmers were very enthusiastic about visiting the exhibitions. For example, when the exhibition was held in Tangjia Group, Longzhong Township, nearly 300 of the group's 331 people attended; farmers maintained order on their own and listened attentively to the explanations of the work cadres.

After seeing the exhibition, farmers' ideological understanding was greatly improved. First, they recognized the benefits of national industrial construction for farmers and the close relationship between workers and farmers. For example, after seeing the exhibition, farmer Sun Ruifu from Longzhong Township said: "Workers and farmers cannot do without each other. We rely on workers to sell us cloth, chemical fertilizers, etc., and workers need us to sell them grain. Since liberation, the prices of industrial products have been decreasing year by year. If we sell our surplus grain to the state, workers will be able to supply us with more good things, and the prices will be even cheaper." Second, they recognized the consistency between individual and national interests. For example, the pictures and slides exhibited in Longzhong Township depicted the scene of Su Baiqing, a farmer in the township, being beaten and sawn to death by Japanese invaders. This evoked painful memories for the visitors. After Tang Rongyi recalled the rape of his mother and sister by Japanese invaders, he said sadly: "Alas, no matter how much you produce, it is all in vain without a strong country!" He resolved to sell his surplus grain to the state to ensure the consolidation of national defense. Third, they recognized the importance of the state's control of grain in ensuring supply and stabilizing prices. One of the pictures at the exhibition depicted Fan Anzhen, a landlord in Renhe Township before liberation, collecting a lot of rent grain, watching farmers starve and eat tree leaves because they had no money to buy grain, but he set fire to two large granaries of rice. After seeing this picture, an old woman said to the work cadre: "Comrade, this exhibition is really right. Before liberation, in 1947, adults were starving and children were crying, it was really hard! This year, there was such a long drought in June. If the government hadn't controlled the grain, I'm afraid many people would have starved to death!" After the exhibition was held in Yeguan Township, many farmers said: Grain must be controlled by the state, and we must never allow grain hoarders to exploit us with high prices or high interest! Fourth, they realized that they should actively participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations, increase production and practice economy, and sell a large amount of surplus grain to the state. The exhibitions in each township announced the increased production of key mutual aid groups and the plans for saving and selling grain. For example, the exhibition in Longzhong Township announced that the six households in the Tang Zuxian mutual aid group had increased the production of rice by 2,340 catties and buckwheat by 600 catties this year; in addition to the 1,800 catties of grain they had already sold, they planned to sell another 1,600 catties of rice. These typical examples of mutual aid groups made the visitors recognize the benefits of mutual aid and cooperation and promoted the majority of farmers to enthusiastically sell their surplus grain to the state. In Yeguan Township alone, twenty-three activists sold more than 12,300 catties of grain.

Farmers who were educated by the exhibition actively sold grain to support national construction. By November 20th, the district had purchased more than 159,000 catties of rice, and another 76,000 catties were included in the farmers' grain sales plan and will soon be sold to the state.

At present, the First District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of Guanyang County is preparing to revise and enrich the content of the exhibition in accordance with the spirit of the People's Daily editorial "We Must Vigorously Publicize the Party's General Line for the Transition Period to the Farmers," and is preparing to manufacture several more sets for exhibitions in various townships and villages.

    受到展览会教育思想认识提高
    灌阳县第一区农民踊跃卖粮
    广西省灌阳县第一区运用展览会的方式，向农民宣传国家过渡时期的总路线，动员农民把余粮卖给国家，已经取得了初步成绩。
    灌阳县第一区从十一月十三日开始，对各乡积极分子及重点组农民运用展览会进行了把余粮卖给国家的宣传教育。参观展览会的农民非常踊跃。如在龙中乡唐家组展出时，全组三百三十一人，到会的近三百人；农民在会场上自动维持秩序，静心听工作干部的宣传解释。
    看过展览会后，农民思想认识有很大提高。首先是认清了国家工业建设对农民的好处，认清了工人和农民的亲密的关系。如龙中乡农民孙汝甫看过展览后说：“工人和农民谁也离不了谁。我们靠工人卖给我们布匹、化学肥料等，工人需要我们把粮食卖给他们。解放后工业品价格年年降低，我们把余粮卖给国家，工人就能多供给我们些好东西，价格还会更便宜。”第二、认识了个人利益和国家利益的一致性。如龙中乡展出的图画和幻灯片里，画着该乡农民苏白清被日寇毒打、锯死的情景。这引起了参观者的惨痛的回忆。唐荣易想起母亲、姐姐被日寇强奸等情形后，沉痛地说：“唉呀，你生产再多，没有强大的国家都是空的！”他下定决心，把余粮卖给国家，保证巩固国防。第三、认识了国家掌握粮食对保证供应、稳定物价的重要作用。展览会上有一幅画，画着解放前仁合乡地主范安珍收了许多租谷，眼望着农民没钱买粮挨饿吃树叶，他却放火烧了两大仓稻谷。一个老太婆看了这幅画后对工作干部说：“同志，这个展览会讲得实在对。解放前，一九四七年那一年，大人饿得发慌，小孩又哭又闹，真难过啊！今年六月天旱那么久，要不是政府掌握粮食，怕早就有好多人饿死了！”叶官乡举行展览会后，许多农民说：粮食一定要让国家掌握，绝不能让囤粮的家伙用高价或高利来剥削我们！第四、认识到应该积极参加互助合作组织，增产节约，把大量余粮卖给国家。各乡的展览会上，都公布了重点互助组产量增加的情况和节约卖粮的计划。如龙中乡展览会上公布了唐祖贤互助组六户农民，今年增产稻谷二千三百四十斤、荞麦六百斤；他们除早已卖出的一千八百斤粮食外，计划还卖一千六百斤稻谷。这些互助组的典型事例，使参观者认识了互助合作的好处，并推动广大农民踊跃把余粮卖给国家。仅叶官乡二十三个积极分子，就卖粮一万二千三百多斤。
    受到展览会教育的农民，纷纷卖粮，支援国家建设。到十一月二十日止，全区收购稻谷达十五万九千多斤，另外还有七万六千多斤，农民已订入卖粮计划，即将卖给国家。
    目前，中共灌阳县第一区委会正准备根据人民日报“必须大张旗鼓地向农民宣传过渡时期的总路线”这一社论的精神，把展览会的内容加以修改、充实，并准备多制造几套，以便深入各乡、各村进行展览。（中共灌阳县第一区委会）
