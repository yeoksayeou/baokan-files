The 48th issue of the Chinese edition of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!", the organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, has been published.

In its editorial entitled "The Main Question of the Moment," this issue points out that the question of easing international tensions is the main question of the moment, and its solution is of vital interest to the vast majority of people in the world. However, on this issue, there are currently two lines, two positions: one is the position of the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries, and the other is the position of the imperialist forces headed by the ruling clique in the United States. The editorial then discusses the Soviet government's recent proposals aimed at a peaceful resolution of all international disputes and puts forward the issues that urgently need to be resolved in easing international tensions, such as the German question, the Korean question, the question of the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, the question of the establishment of aggressive U.S. bases around the world, and the reduction of armaments, especially the prohibition of the use of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. The editorial emphasizes that all good people attach great importance to the peaceful settlement of international disputes. The unbreakable peace movement of our time is growing and flourishing. The movement of people in various countries demanding that their governments resolve international disputes has spread all over the world. Hundreds of millions of people are increasingly convinced that as long as there is determination, a peaceful solution to international disputes can be found.

Important articles published in this issue include: "The Italian Communist Party Cultivates and Educates Party Activists" by Pietro Secchia, Deputy General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party; "On the Eve of Elections for Local People's Councils in Romania" by Dumitru Coliu, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, etc.

Secchia's article points out that the Italian Communist Party has achieved good results since 1945 by implementing the correct policy of reorganizing party organizations into smaller units. The Italian Communist Party now has 97 provincial organizations, 283 local committees, 9,993 district organizations, and 52,481 regional and factory branches. The increase in intermediate leading bodies has further enhanced the political enthusiasm of Communist Party members, accelerated the growth of cadres, and enabled the Party to mobilize more members to engage in work inside and outside the Party, thereby accelerating the development of Party activists and all Party organizations. The article emphasizes that the Italian Communist Party's purpose in cultivating activists and building the Party has always been to win over the majority of the working people, strengthen the unity of the working class and the unity of the whole country, consolidate and expand the alliance of the Party and other organizations, and strengthen the strength of democratic groups, especially trade unions. Coliu's article points out that the elections for local people's councils in Romania, which will be held on December 20, are a major event in Romania's political and economic life. The campaign launched before the elections is being carried out under the slogan of strengthening the foundation of the people's democratic state – the worker-peasant alliance led by the working class. In this election campaign, the number of voters has increased two-fold compared with the past era of landlord and bourgeois rule. The working people have put forward many suggestions on improving the work of local people's councils at various gatherings and have demonstrated initiative and creativity in their production posts. All this illustrates the truly democratic nature of the electoral system and the more unbreakable unity between the Party, the government, and the people. (Xinhua News Agency)

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第四十八期介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五三年第四十八期已经出版。
    本期在题为“当前的主要问题”的社论中指出：缓和国际紧张局势的问题是当前的主要问题，它的解决与全世界绝大多数人都有切身的利害关系。但是在这个问题上目前存在着两条路线，两种立场：一种是苏联及其他爱好和平的国家的立场，一种是以美国当权派为首的帝国主义势力的立场。社论接着谈到了苏联政府最近提出的旨在和平解决一切国际争端的建议，并提出了当前在缓和国际紧张局势中亟待解决的问题，如德国问题、朝鲜问题，中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位问题，美国在世界各地建立侵略基地问题，裁减军备，特别是禁止使用原子武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器问题等。社论着重说：所有善良的人们都十分重视和平解决国际争端。当代的坚不可摧的和平运动正在壮大和蓬勃发展。各国人民要求本国政府解决国际争端的运动已遍及全世界。亿万人民越来越相信，只要有决心，就能够找到和平解决国际争端的办法。
    本期刊载的重要文章有：意大利共产党副总书记彼·谢嘉的“意大利共产党培养和教育党的活动分子”，罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会政治局候补委员杜·柯柳的“罗马尼亚地方人民议会选举前夕”等。
    谢嘉的文章指出：意大利共产党从一九四五年起，由于实行了把党组织改组成较小单位的正确政策，已收到了良好效果。意大利共产党现在有九十七个省组织，二百八十三个地方委员会，九千九百九十三个区组织和五万二千四百八十一个地区支部和工厂支部。由于中级领导机关的增加，更加提高了共产党员的政治积极性，加速了干部的成长过程，并使党能够动员更多的党员从事党内外的工作，从而加速了党活动分子和所有党组织的发展。文章着重说：意大利共产党在培养活动分子和建党工作方面的目的，过去和现在始终是争取大多数劳动人民，加强工人阶级的团结和全国的团结，巩固和扩大党和其他组织的联盟，加强民主团体首先是工会的力量。柯柳的文章指出：将于十二月二十日举行的罗马尼亚地方人民议会的选举，是罗马尼亚政治和经济生活中的一件大事，选举前展开的运动是在加强人民民主国家的基础——工人阶级领导的工农联盟——的口号下进行的。在这次选举运动中，选民的数目比过去地主、资产阶级统治时代增加了两倍。劳动人民在各种集会上提出了许多关于改进地方人民议会工作的建议，并在生产岗位上发挥了积极性和创造性。这一切说明了选举制度的真正民主性质，以及党、政府和人民之间的团结更加不可摧毁。（新华社）
