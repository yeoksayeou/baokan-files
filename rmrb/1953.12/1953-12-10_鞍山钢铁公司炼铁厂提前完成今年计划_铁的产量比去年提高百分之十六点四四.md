    鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂提前完成今年计划
    铁的产量比去年提高百分之十六点四四
    鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂在十二月四日下午二时，提前全面完成今年国家计划。铁的产量比去年提高百分之十六点四四。
    去年，炼铁厂有八个月没有完成国家计划，在第四季度进行了突击生产，才在去年年底提前五天完成全年计划。今年，炼铁厂加强了政治教育工作，提高了全厂职工的政治觉悟和劳动热情；实行了计划管理，贯彻执行了生产区域管理制；积极学习苏联先进经验，实行炉顶调剂法和全风量操作法，并且按照苏联专家建议，采取了保护高炉炉底的措施。结果，月月均衡地超额完成国家计划，并提前二十七天全面完成了全年计划（包括产量、质量、品种、成本、劳动生产率）。现在，炼铁厂全体职工正在为完成增产节约计划而努力，并热烈学习国家总路线和加强明年的生产准备工作。
