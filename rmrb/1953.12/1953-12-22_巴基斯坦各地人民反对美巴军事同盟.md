Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, December 20th: People in various parts of Pakistan strongly oppose the United States' conspiracy to form a military alliance with Pakistan.

The Barisal Peace Committee of East Pakistan passed a resolution at a recent meeting protesting against the conclusion of a US-Pakistan military alliance and demanding that the East Pakistan Peace Committee organize a signature campaign to support the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact and the settlement of international disputes through consultation.

In Dhaka, a mass rally was held on the 7th, calling on "the Pakistani government to live in peace with all countries" and "not to conclude any military alliances with any country."

In West Pakistan, more and more people are expressing opposition to a military alliance with the United States. A dispatch from Hyderabad, Sindh Province, in "Today's News" on the 9th, wrote: "Sober and rational people in this area demand that the government announce an impartial foreign policy, which is necessary for the construction of Pakistan and world peace. Prominent Muslim League leaders Abdul Qayyum Khan Qumri Mullah, farmer leader Ghulam Hussain Soomro, and social worker Mir Rasud Baksh Talpur all said: This measure, which lacks public support, is harmful to the country." The dispatch went on to say: "Altaf Hussaini, General Secretary of the Provincial (Sindh Province) Trade Union Federation, said: This alliance seriously threatens the peace of our country and the prosperity of the people." A report from Sukkur in "Today's News" on the same day said: "Sober people in this place are also concerned about this and are frightened by American propaganda." Shamsuddin, the convener of the local People's Front, in a statement, demanded that the Pakistani government "remain completely neutral and in no way grant foreign countries military bases."

Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, December 18th, TASS dispatch from Delhi, December 17th: The All-India Women's Liaison Committee held a meeting in Delhi a few days ago. Representatives from Bombay Province, West Bengal Province, Hyderabad State, East Punjab Province, and Uttar Pradesh Province attended the meeting.

The resolution on the US-Pakistan military agreement passed at the meeting said: The recent negotiations between the United States and Pakistan on the conclusion of a military alliance have caused a growing threat to international peace, which deeply worries Indian women. The committee called on the people of India and Pakistan, especially the women of the two countries, to "establish solid friendship and mutual understanding between the two neighboring countries in order to crush the conspiracies of warmongers."

The committee expressed the solidarity of Indian women with the national liberation movement in British Guiana. The committee resolution demanded "the immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops from the territory of Guiana and the restoration of the rights of the democratic government."

    在达卡，七日曾举行群众大会，呼吁“巴基斯坦政府与各国和平相处”，“不要与任何国家缔结任何军事同盟”。
    在西巴基斯坦，越来越多的人表示反对与美国缔结军事同盟。“今天报”信德省海得拉巴九日通讯写道：“这个地区的清醒和理智的人要求政府宣布一个不偏不倚的外交政策，这对巴基斯坦的建设和世界和平是很必要的。著名的回教联盟领袖阿布都尔·卡玉姆·康普利毛拉，农民领袖吴拉姆·胡森·梭姆鲁，社会工作者米尔·拉苏德·巴克希·塔尔普尔都说：这种没有舆论支持的措施是对国家有害的。”这篇通讯接着写道：“省（信德省）工会联合会总书记阿尔塔夫·侯赛尼说：这种同盟严重威胁着我国的和平和人民的繁荣。”“今天报”同一天发自苏库尔的报道说：“这个地方的清醒人士也对此表示关切，对美国的宣传感到恐惧。”当地人民阵线召集人桑苏丁在一项声明中，要求巴基斯坦政府“完全保持中立，无论如何不给予外国以军事基地”。
