Over the past three years, the large number of new-style agricultural tools supplied to farmers by the state, and the machine tractor stations established this year as a priority, have become an important material foundation for the state to help farmers improve farming techniques, increase agricultural production, and guide farmers to take the road of collectivization.

Since 1950, the country has promoted new-style agricultural tools, and to date, more than 600,000 sets have been promoted. Among them, in North China, Northwest China (excluding Xinjiang), and the areas north of the Yangtze River in East China and Central South China, more than 540,000 sets of various single-piece new-style agricultural tools, mainly walking plows, have been promoted. In Northeast China and Xinjiang, where animal power is stronger, more than 60,000 sets of large-scale Soviet-style new agricultural tools such as single-furrow plows, double-furrow plows, disc harrows, seeders, rollers, harvesters, mowers, and threshers have been promoted.

These new-style agricultural tools have greatly helped farmers' production in various regions. According to statistics on ten crops in nine provinces and regions in North China, Northwest China, East China, and Central South China in 1951, under the same natural conditions, using new-style walking plows for cultivation resulted in an average increase of 16.8% compared to old plows. This year, Sun Huanchang's mutual aid group in Laiyang, Shandong, used new-style plows to cultivate land and plant millet, resulting in an average increase of 47 jin per mu and an additional 100 jin of millet stalks. In the Northeast region, the promotion of complete sets of large-scale animal-powered new agricultural tools (generally each set includes four plows, one harrow, two rollers, one seeder, one harvester, a total of five types and nine pieces; some also include threshers, animal-powered transmissions, or diesel-powered machines) has enabled deep plowing, flat sowing, dense planting, and timely harvesting. As a result of using these tools in more than 60 mutual aid groups last year, the average increase in production was about 25%. Currently, farmers have more than 4,000 sets of such agricultural tools. Most of the land cultivated with these tools can increase production by 30 jin per mu, and in wheat-producing areas, the increase can reach 50-60 jin per mu. The Gaokan and Xinglong agricultural production cooperatives in Gaokan Village, a suburb of Shenyang City, cultivated several major crops this year, such as wheat, sorghum, millet, and soybeans, using new-style agricultural tools under the specific guidance of the agricultural technology guidance station, resulting in an overall increase in production, averaging more than 30% higher than the local average yield. Farmers in Tacheng and Yili Prefectures in Xinjiang, due to the widespread use of large-scale new agricultural tools, achieved a general wheat yield of over 200 jin even under extensive farming habits of no fertilization, no weeding, and broadcasting.

In grain and dry-land farming plains areas, eleven machine tractor stations were established this year with a focus, equipped with 64 tractors and 303 agricultural implements (including three combine harvesters), carrying out mechanized operations on more than 80,000 mu of land belonging to five collective farms, 58 agricultural production cooperatives, 39 mutual aid groups, nine local state-owned farms, and a small number of individual farmers, further demonstrating the role of agricultural mechanization in increasing grain production. The Xinghuo Collective Farm, served by the Huachuan Machine Tractor Station in Northeast China, has achieved a mechanization level of 40% of the total annual labor volume. Because the farm used tractors to plow the land and adopted the new "dry direct seeding of rice" cultivation method, the 3,060 mu of rice achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with an average rice yield of over 800 jin per mu, more than double the yield of the general public. The Zhongsu Youhao (Sino-Soviet Friendship) Collective Farm, served by the Changzhi Machine Tractor Station, planted a total of 12,035 mu of autumn grain. Because the plowing and harrowing operations were basically mechanized, despite suffering from insect pests and drought before the autumn harvest, it still achieved a harvest of 271 jin of raw grain per mu, exceeding the yield before mechanization last year (226 jin per mu) by 19.9%; exceeding the best mutual aid group in the village (203 jin per mu) by 33.4%; and exceeding individual farmers (184 jin per mu) by 47.2%. In terms of crops, corn increased by 33% compared to the surrounding masses, and soybeans increased by 47.4%. The Beijing Machine Tractor Station cultivated more than 970 mu of cotton for the Hongxing Collective Farm, with an average increase of more than 50% per mu compared to last year.

Because new-style agricultural tools and mechanical agricultural tools have a significant effect on promoting agricultural production increases, they have been warmly welcomed by the vast number of farmers, enabling farmers to see the prospects for industrial assistance in agricultural development and promoting the further development of agricultural production mutual aid and cooperative organizations.

Gaocun Village in Dingxiang County, Shanxi Province, originally did not have a single mutual aid group. In 1951, through the promotion and use of new-style walking plows, thirteen mutual aid groups were established. Last year, 129 individual farmers in the second and fifth districts of the suburbs of Jinan City, Shandong Province, also organized 39 mutual aid groups by borrowing new-style walking plows. Yumin County in Tacheng Prefecture, Xinjiang Province, promoted 304 new-style plows, promoting farmers to newly organize 304 mutual aid groups. In the Northeast and Xinjiang regions, many farmers have organized themselves from individual farming to using complete sets of large-scale Soviet-style new agricultural tools and maximizing the effectiveness of new-style agricultural tools, breaking down land boundaries and concentrating the use of draft animals, and growing into agricultural production cooperatives. Wang Yongzhen's mutual aid group in Hailun, Heilongjiang, expanded from six households to eleven households in the spring of the year before last because they used new-style agricultural tools, and grew into an agricultural production cooperative last year. After using large-scale new agricultural tools, Bawa's mutual aid group in Baiyanggou Village, Suiding County, Yili Prefecture, Xinjiang Province, also changed from a mutual aid group to an agricultural production cooperative this year, and this year's wheat yield is expected to increase by nearly 50% compared to last year.

After seeing the benefits of machine cultivation with their own eyes, 23 agricultural production cooperatives near the Jiaoxian Machine Tractor Station in Shandong Province registered with the district government to request machine cultivation. The contract initially signed by the Guan Xiangyun agricultural production cooperative with the Jiaoxian Machine Tractor Station was to cultivate 405 mu with machines, but after the cultivation was completed, it requested an increase to 600 mu. The Gao Yumei agricultural production cooperative in Xihua County, Henan Province, also saw the benefits of machine cultivation with their own eyes and temporarily changed the land to connect it into a single piece, requesting the Xihua Machine Tractor Station to cultivate it with machines, increasing from 207 mu to 266 mu. In the Zhongsu Youhao (Sino-Soviet Friendship) Collective Farm in Changzhi County, Shanxi Province, about half of the members did not recognize the benefits of the collective this spring and their thinking wavered. Through the practical education of increased production through mechanization, after the autumn harvest and the distribution of grain, most of them no longer mentioned withdrawing from the farm, and the agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid groups, and many individual farmers in the nearby Lujiazhuang, Nantian Gong, and Zhangtou villages voluntarily requested to join the farm and organize agricultural production cooperatives. After the bumper harvest this year, more than 40 farmers joined the Xinghuo Collective Farm in Huachuan County, Songjiang Province. When the Mentai Zi State-owned Fang Qiu Lake Machine耕 Farm in Fengyang County, Anhui Province, was cultivating land and planting wheat for the Li Shulan mutual aid group in Pubaogang Village, the fact that a small piece of land belonging to other farmers was sandwiched in the midst of the more than 50 mu of land connected to the Li Shulan mutual aid group and affected the mechanized operation caused the members of the Li Shulan mutual aid group to be dissatisfied with the small piece of land, and they decided to exchange land and establish an agricultural production cooperative to use machines for cultivation next year. This fact spread to the ears of the farmers in the entire village and the suburbs of Wuhu City, also educating the vast number of farmers and promoting farmers to actively develop mutual aid groups and establish agricultural production cooperatives.

    三年来国家用新农具和拖拉机帮农民增产
    推动农业互助合作组织巩固发展
    三年多来国家供应农民的大量新式农具和今年重点建立的机器拖拉机站，已成为国家帮助农民改进耕作技术，提高农业生产，引导农民走合作化道路的重要物质基础。
    全国从一九五零年开始推广新式农具，到现在已推广六十余万部。其中在华北、西北（新疆除外）和华东、中南的长江以北地区，推广了以步犁为主的各种单件新式农具五十四万多部；在东北、新疆畜力较强的地区，推广了苏联式大型新式农具如一铧犁、双铧犁、圆盘耙、播种机、镇压器、收割机、割草机、脱粒机等共六万多部。
    这些新式农具对各地农民的生产都有很大帮助。一九五一年就华北、西北、华东、中南九个省区十一种农作物的统计，同样自然条件，用新式步犁耕作比旧犁耕作平均增产了百分之十六点八；今年山东莱阳孙焕昌互助组使用新式犁耕地、种谷子，平均每亩增产四十七斤，多收谷秸一百斤。东北区推广的成套大型畜力新式农具（一般每套包括犁四、耙一、镇压器二、播种机一、收割机一，共五种九件，有的还包括脱粒机、畜力传动机或柴油动力机），由于做到了深翻、平播、密植、及时收割，去年六十多个互助组使用的结果，平均增产百分之二十五左右。现在，农民手中已经有了四千多套这样的农具。用这些农具耕作的地，大部分每亩都可增产三十斤，麦产区每亩增产可达五六十斤。沈阳市郊高坎村的高坎、兴隆两个农业生产合作社，今年几种主要作物如小麦、高粱、谷子、大豆等，都是在农业技术指导站具体指导下，用新式农具耕种的，结果达到了全面增产，平均每亩超过当地一般产量百分之三十以上。新疆塔城、伊犁两专区的农民，由于广泛地使用了大型新式农具，在不施肥、不除草、撒播的粗放耕作习惯下，小麦一般产量还在二百斤以上。
    粮谷旱作平原地区，今年有重点地建立了机器拖拉机站十一个，配备了六十四台拖拉机，三百零三台农机具（其中包括联合收割机三台），在五个集体农庄、五十八个农业生产合作社、三十九个互助组、九个地方国营农场和少数个体农民的八万多亩土地上，进行机械化作业，更加显示了农业机械化对增产粮食的作用。东北桦川机器拖拉机站所服务的星火集体农庄，机械化作业已达到全年总劳动量的百分之四十。由于该农庄使用拖拉机翻地和采用“水稻旱直播”的新耕作法，使三千零六十亩水稻获得空前丰收，每亩稻谷产量平均达到八百斤以上，比一般群众的产量高出一倍。长治机器拖拉机站所服务的中苏友好集体农庄，共种秋粮一万二千零三十五亩，由于耕、耙作业基本上达到了机械化，虽在秋收前遭到虫灾、旱灾，仍获得每亩平均二百七十一斤原粮的丰收，超过去年机械化作业前产量（每亩二二六斤）百分之十九点九；超过所在村最好互助组（每亩二○三斤）百分之三十三点四；超过个体农民（每亩一八四斤）百分之四十七点二。就作物讲，其中玉米较周围群众增产百分之三十三，大豆增产百分之四十七点四。北京机器拖拉机站为红星集体农庄耕种的棉花九百七十多亩，每亩平均比去年增产百分之五十以上。
    由于新式农具和机械农具在促进农业增产上有显著作用，因而它受到了广大农民的热烈欢迎，使农民看到了工业帮助农业发展的远景，推动了农业生产互助合作组织的进一步发展。
    山西省定襄县高村原来没有一个互助组，一九五一年通过推广使用新式步犁，才成立了十三个互助组。去年山东省济南市郊二区、五区有一百二十九户个体农民，也通过贷用新式步犁，组织了三十九个互助组。新疆省塔城专区裕民县推广三百零四张新式犁，推动农民新组织了互助组三百零四个。东北和新疆地区，许多农民为了使用成套的苏联式大型新式农具和发挥新式农具的效能，由单干而组织起来，由互助组而打破地界、集中使用耕畜，成长为农业生产合作社。黑龙江海伦王永珍互助组，前年春季因为使用了新式农具，由六户扩大到十一户，去年又成长为农业生产合作社。新疆省伊犁专区绥定县白杨沟村巴娃互助组，在使用了大型新式农具后，今年也由互助组变为农业生产合作社，并且今年小麦产量要比去年增产将近百分之五十。
    山东胶县的机器拖拉机站在为农民使用机器耕作中，让农民亲眼看到了机器耕地的好处以后，附近有二十三个农业生产合作社到区政府登记要求机耕。管相云农业生产合作社起初和胶县机器拖拉机站签订的合同是：用机器耕种四百零五亩，但是耕完以后，又要求增加到六百亩。河南省西华县高玉梅农业生产合作社也是亲眼看到了机器耕种好，临时换地连片，要求西华机器拖拉机站用机器耕种，由二百零七亩增加到二百六十六亩。山西省长治县中苏友好集体农庄，今春有半数左右的庄员认识不到集体的好处，思想动摇，通过机械化增产的实际教育，秋收分到粮食后，大部分都不再提退庄的话，并且附近的鹿家庄、南天贡和漳头村的农业生产合作社、互助组和不少的单干农民还自愿要求加入农庄和组织农业生产合作社。松江省桦川县的星火集体农庄，今年丰收后，有四十多户农民加入了农庄。安徽省凤阳县门台子国营方邱湖机耕农场，在为蒲包岗村的李树兰互助组耕地种麦时，因为李树兰互助组连成一片的五十多亩地当中，夹有其他农民的一小块地，而影响了机械化的作业，就引起了李树兰互助组组员对小块土地的不满，决心调换土地，成立农业生产合作社，下年用机器进行耕作。这一事实传到了全村和芜湖市郊区农民的耳朵里，也教育了广大农民，推动了农民积极发展互助组，成立农业生产合作社。（杨茂武）
