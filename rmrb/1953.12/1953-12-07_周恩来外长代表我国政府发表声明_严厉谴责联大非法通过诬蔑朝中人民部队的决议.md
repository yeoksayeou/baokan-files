Xinhua News Agency, December 6th:

Premier Zhou Enlai of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China issued a statement regarding the United Nations General Assembly's illegal passage of a resolution slandering the Chinese and Korean People's Forces. The full text is as follows:

I. Following its illegal passage of a slanderous resolution on February 1, 1951, falsely accusing the People's Republic of China of being an aggressor, the United Nations General Assembly, on December 3, 1953, again disregarded the opposition of peace-loving people and fair-minded public opinion worldwide, ignored the just demands of representatives from the Soviet Union and People's Democratic countries, and disregarded the dissenting opinions of the vast majority of Asian-Arab nations. In the absence of representatives from the People's Republic of China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the UN General Assembly blatantly adopted a resolution jointly proposed by the United States and four of its puppet states, based on a report fabricated by the U.S. government accusing the Chinese and Korean People's Forces of committing "atrocities" against UN POWs and Korean civilians, expressing "grave concern" and "condemning" the so-called "atrocities". This resolution is clearly illegal, slanderous, and invalid, and it once again casts a shameful mark on the history of the United Nations.

II. The U.S. government's slander against the Chinese and Korean People's Forces is baseless. The war waged by the Chinese and Korean People's Forces against U.S. aggression is highly just. Therefore, whether at the front or in the rear, they are filled with a spirit of great revolutionary humanitarianism. The fact that they cherish the people and treat prisoners of war with leniency has long been known to the people of the world. Many directly repatriated UN POWs have demonstrated, through their own healthy bodies and expressions of gratitude for the lenient treatment received from the Chinese and Korean side, that the Chinese and Korean side has consistently provided UN POWs with treatment exceeding that stipulated in the Geneva Convention. This policy of cherishing the people and treating prisoners of war with leniency, adopted by the Chinese and Korean People's Forces, stands in stark contrast to the policy of the U.S. aggressor troops, who indiscriminately slaughtered Korean people and abused Chinese and Korean POWs. Therefore, the U.S. government is trying to fabricate lies to confuse the public. However, in the face of ironclad facts, no matter how the U.S. government manipulates the majority in the UN General Assembly to engage in malicious and despicable slander against the Chinese and Korean side, it cannot achieve its shameful goals. On the contrary, it can only further expose the brutal nature of U.S. imperialism and cause the United Nations organization to increasingly lose its moral standing.

III. In the Korean War, it was precisely the U.S. aggressors who wantonly violated international law and humanitarian standards. People will never forget that U.S. troops dropped millions of tons of bombs on peaceful cities and villages in Korea; U.S. troops unscrupulously used large-scale destructive incendiary napalm bombs and poison gas bombs; U.S. troops conducted inhumane bacteriological warfare on the territory of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and in Northeast China; U.S. troops and the Rhee Syngman troops slaughtered and plundered tens of thousands of Korean civilians, and frantically destroyed Korean factories, hospitals, schools, cultural relics, and civilian residences; U.S. troops and the Rhee Syngman reactionary clique violated the Geneva Convention, using extremely barbaric and cruel means to persecute and abuse captured Chinese and Korean personnel in POW camps on Koje Island, Jeju Island, and Pongam Island. Even today, U.S. military authorities are directly directing Rhee Syngman's and Chiang Kai-shek's agents to carry out appalling terrorist control in the non-directly repatriated POW camps in the Korean Demilitarized Zone, and persecuting and abusing POWs who wish to be repatriated, in order to achieve their goal of forcibly detaining POWs.

All of these atrocities can be separately corroborated by conclusive evidence from the fair and outstanding investigation reports of the Women's International Democratic Federation, the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, and the International Scientific Commission for the Investigation of the Facts Concerning Bacteriological Warfare in Korea and China, from the dispatches of American and British journalists, from the reports of the Swiss International Committee of the Red Cross, and from the confessions of U.S. POW camp commanders Brigadier General Dodd and Brigadier General Colson, and from the recent secret orders conveyed by South Korean agent Park Dong-hyuk to the Rhee-Chiang agents in the POW camps in the Korean Demilitarized Zone, as announced by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. The U.S. government and the Rhee Syngman reactionary clique have never dared to deny this; they can only maintain a criminal silence. They are truly the objects that the United Nations General Assembly should condemn.

IV. Just as the world is concerned about the Panmunjom talks between the two parties to the Korean Armistice Agreement, the U.S. government, with its hands stained with the blood of the Chinese and Korean people, is presenting such a retaliatory report to the United Nations General Assembly, which has a major conspiracy behind it. The reason why the U.S. government wants to use the United Nations General Assembly to peddle its fabricated lies is to divert world public opinion, maintain the tension in the Far East and Asia, so that it can continue to delay the convening of the Korean political conference, completely destroy the process of explaining to prisoners of war, step up its military aggression in Southeast Asia, accelerate the rearmament of Japan, expand the establishment of a network of military bases in Asia, and promote the organization of aggressive military alliances in Asia, so as to push forward its policy of expanding its arms race. Every kind man and woman who wishes for a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue and the easing of international tensions must be especially vigilant against the U.S. government's major conspiracy behind this slanderous report to undermine peace. The Chinese people will resolutely oppose this major conspiracy of the United States to the end.

V. The United Nations organization should be an important tool for maintaining and promoting international peace. Today, when the Korean armistice has brought some easing of international tensions, the United Nations organization should, in accordance with the wishes of peace-loving people around the world, take effective measures to ensure the effective implementation of the Korean POW repatriation agreement and promote the rapid convening of a political conference to facilitate the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. However, today, the majority of countries in the United Nations continue to follow the United States' "Cold War" and provocative policies, disregarding the existence of the People's Republic of China and its legitimate rights in the United Nations, and even passing a resolution slandering the Chinese and Korean People's Forces. This has further diminished the prestige and role of the United Nations organization in maintaining international peace and cooperation. Although the Soviet Union and the various People's Democratic countries have made continuous efforts to make the United Nations take responsibility for maintaining international peace, and many Asian-Arab countries have also had this desire, the majority of countries in the United Nations have succumbed to U.S. pressure, causing the United Nations to move further and further away from its original purpose and fall into a deep crisis.

It should be pointed out that this absurd and shameful resolution of the United Nations General Assembly, like the slanderous resolution "condemning" China as an "aggressor" in 1951, cannot harm the Chinese and Korean people who are fighting for justice and truth in the slightest; on the contrary, it can only show that the United Nations organization has been reduced to a propaganda organ of the U.S. government and a docile tool to help U.S. warmongers create international tensions. Therefore, the countries that supported the U.S. proposal this time must bear serious responsibility for the consequences of this action.

VI. The Chinese people express infinite indignation at the United Nations General Assembly's illegal adoption of the shameless resolution slandering the "atrocities" of the Chinese and Korean People's Forces. I am authorized to represent the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China in severely condemning this action by the United Nations General Assembly. We call on the people of the world who love peace and uphold justice to rise up and launch a vigorous struggle to oppose all conspiracies to turn the United Nations into a tool for implementing U.S. war policies and covering up U.S. aggressive atrocities, and to strive to bring the United Nations back to the path prescribed by the United Nations Charter. To achieve this goal, the government and people of the People's Republic of China are willing to work together with the governments and people of all peace-loving countries!

    周恩来外长代表我国政府发表声明
    严厉谴责联大非法通过诬蔑朝中人民部队的决议
    【新华社六日讯】中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长为联合国大会非法通过诬蔑朝中人民部队的决议发表声明。全文如下：
    一、联合国大会继一九五一年二月一日非法通过了诬蔑中华人民共和国为侵略者的诽谤决议案之后，现在又于一九五三年十二月三日，在没有中华人民共和国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加的情况下，不顾全世界爱好和平人民和公正舆论的反对，不顾苏联和人民民主国家代表的正义主张，不顾绝大多数亚洲—阿拉伯国家的不同意见，公然根据美国政府所捏造的朝中人民部队对联合国军战俘和朝鲜平民施行“暴行”的报告，通过了一项由美国挟持着四个仆从国家联合提出的“表示严重关注”并“谴责”所谓“暴行”的决议案。这一决议显然是非法的，诽谤的，无效的，它又一次在联合国的历史上打下了一道可耻的烙印。
    二、美国政府对于朝中人民部队的诬蔑，是毫无根据的。朝中人民部队所进行的反对美国侵略的战争，具有高度的正义性，因此，不论在前线或后方，他们都充满了伟大的革命人道主义的精神。他们爱护人民和宽待战俘的事实，早已为世界人民所共知。许多直接遣返的联合国军战俘，都以他们自己的健康身体和感谢朝中方面宽待的表示，证明了朝中方面始终以超过日内瓦公约规定的优遇给予联合国军战俘。朝中人民部队这种爱护人民和宽待战俘的政策，与美国侵略军滥杀朝鲜人民和虐待朝中战俘的政策，形成了尖锐的对照。因此，美国政府就力图捏造谎言，混淆人民的视听。但是，在铁的事实面前，无论美国怎样挟持着联合国大会的多数对于朝中方面进行恶毒卑鄙的诬蔑，都是不能达到它的可耻的目的的。相反地，它只能更加暴露美帝国主义的残暴本质，使联合国机构日益在道义上声名扫地。
    三、在朝鲜战争中，肆意破坏国际法准则和人道标准的，恰恰就是美国侵略者自己。人们将永远不会忘记：是美国军队对朝鲜的和平城市和乡村投下了成百万吨的炸弹；是美国军队肆无忌惮地使用了大规模毁灭性的燃烧汽油弹和毒气弹；是美国军队在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国领土上和中国东北境内进行了灭绝人性的细菌战；是美国军队和李承晚军队成千上万地屠杀和掳掠朝鲜的平民，疯狂地毁灭朝鲜的工厂、医院、学校、文化古迹和平民住宅；是美国军队和李承晚反动集团违反日内瓦公约，在巨济岛、济州岛和蜂岩岛等地战俘营中采用极野蛮残酷的手段来迫害和虐杀朝中被俘人员。就在今天，美国军事当局还在直接指挥李承晚、蒋介石的特务对朝鲜非军事区战俘营中不直接遣返的朝中被俘人员，实行令人发指的恐怖控制，并迫害和虐杀有遣返愿望的战俘，以图达到其强迫扣留战俘的目的。
    所有这些暴行，都可分别从国际民主妇女联合会、国际民主法律工作者协会、和调查在朝鲜和中国的细菌战事实国际科学委员会的公正卓越的调查报告中，从美英记者的通讯报道中，从瑞士红十字国际委员会报告及美国战俘营长官杜德准将和柯尔生准将的自供中，从最近中立国遣返委员会公布的南朝鲜特务朴东赫传达给朝鲜非军事区战俘营中的李蒋特务的密令中，得到确凿不移的证据。美国政府和李承晚反动集团对此从来不敢加以否认，他们只能保持犯罪的沉默。他们才真是联合国大会应该谴责的对象。
    四、正当举世关心板门店朝鲜停战缔约双方会谈的时候，满手沾染着朝中人民鲜血的美国政府，在联合国大会提出这样一个反噬的报告，是有其重大阴谋的。美国政府之所以要利用联合国大会来贩卖它凭空捏造的弥天大谎，就是企图转移世界舆论的注意，保持远东及亚洲局势的紧张，以便于它继续拖延朝鲜政治会议的召开，彻底破坏战俘解释工作的进行，加紧对于东南亚的军事侵略，加速日本的重新武装，扩大亚洲军事基地网的建立，并推动亚洲侵略性军事同盟的组织，从而使其扩军备战的政策得以推行。对于美国政府隐藏在这一诽谤报告背后的破坏和平的重大阴谋，每个愿望和平解决朝鲜问题和缓和国际紧张局势的善良男女，必须特别警惕。中国人民对于美国这种重大阴谋，将坚决反对到底。
    五、联合国机构本应成为维护和促进国际和平的重要工具。在今天，朝鲜停战已使国际紧张局势有了一些缓和的时候，联合国机构更应根据世界爱好和平人民的愿望，采取有效的措施，来保证朝鲜战俘遣返协议的切实执行，推动政治会议的迅速召开，以利于朝鲜问题的和平解决。可是，现在联合国的多数国家却继续追随美国的“冷战”和挑衅政策，无视中华人民共和国的存在及其在联合国中的合法权利，甚至还通过这样一个诽谤朝中人民部队的决议案。这就使联合国机构在维护国际和平合作事业上，更加失去它的威信和作用了。虽然苏联和各人民民主国家曾经不断努力，争取联合国负起维护国际和平的责任，许多亚洲—阿拉伯国家也曾具有这种愿望，但是联合国中大多数国家却屈服于美国压力之下，致使联合国离开它的宗旨愈来愈远，陷入了深重的危机之中。
    应该指出，联合国大会这一荒谬可耻的决议，正如一九五一年“谴责”中国为“侵略者”的诽谤决议一样，丝毫中伤不了为正义和真理而奋斗的朝中人民；相反地，它只能表明：联合国机构已经被降低为美国政府的宣传机构和帮助美国战争贩子制造国际紧张局势的驯服工具了。因此，这次赞成美国提案的国家，都应对这种行动的后果负起严重的责任。
    六、中国人民对于联合国大会非法通过的诬蔑朝中人民部队“暴行”的无耻决议案表示无限的愤慨。我受权代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府，对于联合国大会这一行动，提出严厉的谴责。我们号召全世界爱好和平主张正义的人民起来，展开强有力的斗争，来反对一切把联合国变为执行美国战争政策和掩盖美国侵略暴行的工具的阴谋，并努力争取联合国真正回到联合国宪章所规定的道路上来。为了达到这个目标，中华人民共和国政府和人民愿意同各国爱好和平的政府和人民共同奋斗！
    一九五三年十二月六日于北京
