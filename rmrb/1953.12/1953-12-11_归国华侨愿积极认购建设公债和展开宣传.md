Xinhua News Agency, December 10th: Returned Overseas Chinese in Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and other places warmly support the Central People's Government's measure to issue the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds and express their intention to make every effort to purchase them.

Returned Overseas Chinese residing in Guangzhou unanimously expressed their support for the government's decision to issue construction bonds. Huang Jie, chairman of the Overseas Chinese Industrial Construction Co., Ltd., said, "We Overseas Chinese are all eagerly looking forward to a strong motherland and hope to participate in the motherland's great construction. This time the government's decision to issue construction bonds is a very good opportunity for us Overseas Chinese to do our best for the country." Wang Jianchu, a returned Overseas Chinese from Jambi, Indonesia, said, "This issuance of construction bonds is for accelerating national industrialization and for the prosperity of the motherland. Purchasing construction bonds is like planting seeds of happiness. We are indescribably excited to hear this news." He stated that, in addition to doing his best to subscribe, he would also vigorously promote it to Overseas Chinese, so that Overseas Chinese can play their due role in the motherland's planned construction.

Lin Zhuguang, a returned Overseas Chinese from Indonesia and vice chairman of the Fujian Provincial Investment Company, said, "In the past, the Kuomintang reactionaries issued many public bonds, with the aim of swindling money from the people to buy guns and cannons to massacre the people. Now, the People's Government issues public bonds for the country's economic construction and for the welfare of the people. There is an essential difference from the Kuomintang reactionary government's bonds. Overseas Chinese have always hoped to have an independent and prosperous motherland, so they will definitely warmly support this measure of the People's Government." Ye Hongbao, a returned Overseas Chinese from Indonesia and former chairman of the Jakarta Fuzhou Association, said, "The People's Government's issuance of national economic construction bonds is for completing the economic construction of a century-long plan, so that everyone's children and grandchildren can live a free and happy life. We warmly express our support."

Cai Yanji, a returned Overseas Chinese from the Philippines and director of the Xiamen Federation of Industry and Commerce, said, "In order to accelerate national economic construction, it is absolutely necessary to issue national economic construction bonds. Thanks to the recovery and development of production and construction in recent years, the people of Xiamen, like the people of the whole country, are fully capable of supporting the country's large-scale economic construction with the action of subscribing to bonds." Lin Caizhi, chairman of the Xiamen Overseas Chinese Federation, said: Many returned Overseas Chinese and relatives of Overseas Chinese in Xiamen subscribed to the People's Victory Discount Bonds in 1950. Now many people have received the principal and interest, which shows that our country is becoming increasingly prosperous and strong, the currency value is very stable, and the government has a high reputation. The bonds issued are credible. Subscribing to national economic construction bonds is a practical action of loving the motherland. We returned Overseas Chinese and relatives of Overseas Chinese wholeheartedly support it and will do our best to purchase them.

    归国华侨愿积极认购建设公债和展开宣传
    【新华社十日讯】广州、福州、厦门等地归国华侨，热烈拥护中央人民政府发行一九五四年国家经济建设公债的措施，并表示将尽力购买。
    居住在广州的归国华侨，对政府决定发行建设公债一致表示赞同。华侨工业建设股份有限公司董事长黄洁说：“我们华侨都热切盼望着有一个强大的祖国，盼望能够参加祖国的伟大建设，这次政府决定发行建设公债，对我们华侨来说是个为国尽力的很好的机会。”印尼巨港归侨王健初说：“这次发行建设公债是为了加速国家工业化，为了祖国的富强，购买建设公债好比栽种幸福的种子。我们听到这个消息，心情的兴奋是无法形容的。”他表示：除自己尽力认购外，还要大力向海外侨胞宣传，使海外侨胞在祖国计划建设中，发挥应有的作用。
    印尼归国华侨、福建省投资公司副董事长林珠光说：“过去国民党反动派发了很多公债，目的是向人民骗钱，用来买枪炮屠杀人民；现在，人民政府发行公债是为了国家的经济建设，为人民谋福利，同国民党反动政府的公债是有本质的区别的。海外华侨一直盼望自己有一个独立富强的祖国，因此，一定会热烈拥护人民政府这一措施。”印尼归国华侨、前雅加达福州公会主席叶鸿宝说：“人民政府发行国家经济建设公债是为了完成百年大计的经济建设，是为了使大家子子孙孙能够过自由幸福的生活，我们热烈表示拥护。”
    菲律宾归国华侨、厦门市工商业联合会主任委员蔡衍吉说：“为了加速国家经济建设，发行国家经济建设公债是完全必要的。由于几年来生产建设的恢复和发展，厦门市人民和全国人民一样，完全有能力用认购公债的行动，来支援国家大规模经济建设。”厦门市归国华侨联谊会主席林采之说：厦门市有许多归国华侨和华侨眷属在一九五零年曾认购人民胜利折实公债，现在许多人已领到本息，这说明了：我们国家日益富强，币值十分稳定，政府有很高威望，发出的公债是有信用的。认购国家经济建设公债是热爱祖国的一种实际行动，我们归国华侨和华侨眷属都衷心拥护，并要尽力购买。
