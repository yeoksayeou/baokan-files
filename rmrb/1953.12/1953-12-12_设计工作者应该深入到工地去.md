    Design Workers Should Go Deep into Construction Sites
    Shen Conglong, Engineer, Fourth Design Bureau, First Ministry of Machine Building

    Correct designs can only be realized through correct construction; at the same time, only correct designs can guarantee the smooth progress of construction. The relationship between design and construction is as close as lips and teeth. Therefore, design personnel must give good consideration to the needs of construction departments during the design process, avoiding construction difficulties caused by impractical designs as much as possible. After the design is completed, they should also inform construction personnel of their design intentions, enabling them to deeply understand and implement them into construction.

    In the past, we didn't do enough in this regard, which caused great losses to the country. For example, last November, we conducted an inspection of the projects constructed by the Harbin Electric Machinery Factory last year and found more than 500 problems. Some were caused by the carelessness and inadequate consideration of design personnel; some were caused by insufficient communication among various specialties within the design department; some were caused by design delays, leading to construction departments halting work and waiting for drawings, and errors occurring due to hurried construction when the drawings arrived; some were caused by construction departments rushing progress, not paying attention to quality, and not constructing according to the drawings; some were caused by too many design modifications, with construction departments unable to keep up, leading to a loss of confidence in the design and treating the drawings as merely a reference, proceeding with their own set of plans during actual construction; some were due to the discovery of problems with the drawings during construction, but construction departments being unwilling or unable to easily contact the design department, forcing them to handle the situation expediently; some were due to construction departments being unable to find the materials specified in the design, leading them to independently decide to replace them with other materials, resulting in non-compliance with the design intent; and some were simply due to construction departments not clearly reading the drawings, resulting in errors.

    The exposure of these errors made us deeply realize that, at a time when design standards are not yet high and basic construction projects are being carried out on a large scale, if design personnel do not closely cooperate with construction departments, it will inevitably lead to construction errors, rework, and work stoppages, affecting the progress and quality of the project.

    Learning from these lessons, this year, when we started working on construction drawings, we extensively solicited opinions from construction departments, understood their requirements, and met their needs. After the widespread commencement of work, we also dispatched a working group consisting of design personnel from various specialties to work at the construction site on a permanent basis, to further strengthen the coordination between design and construction.

    Before going to the construction site, we first carried out some preparatory work.

    First, we drafted a work plan for the working group and organized everyone to discuss it repeatedly, so that everyone clearly understood that going to the construction site was to better serve construction. Second, we selected the construction designs of two key workshops and conducted a major quality inspection. During the inspection, we discovered that there were as many as 696 problems on the drawings that had already been sent to the construction site, of which design errors accounted for 76 percent. This showed that our design was hasty and the quality was poor. If the construction site had proceeded according to these erroneous drawings, it would have caused serious losses. This made us feel even more strongly the necessity of design personnel going to the construction site. In addition, before the construction drawings were sent to the construction site, we also organized the responsible design personnel from various specialties to go to the construction units to explain the contents of the construction drawings. Because the construction units attached great importance to this matter, they put forward many valuable opinions for improving the design, making the combination of design and construction even closer.

    After we arrived at the construction site, we did the following:

    1.  Corrected errors on the drawings at any time. These errors were diverse, including numerical errors, unclear drawings, errors in design principles, and errors in the coordination of various designs. For example, there were 20 incorrect numbers on the roof truss drawing of the forging workshop, the bend of the power pipeline was larger than the trench and could not be put in; the heating pipes of the foundry workshop collided with the crane beam, etc. If these errors were not corrected in time, they would inevitably cause rework, waste, or work stoppage losses.

    2.  According to the requirements of the construction and materials departments, we promptly and appropriately revised the design work. For example, simplifying the specifications of rivets, so that the preparation of rivets could be carried out in advance; changing hollow bricks to cinder cement, which facilitated construction, etc.

    3.  Checked the quality of the project and the errors in construction, promptly put forward opinions, urged the relevant departments to take necessary measures to improve, or directly participated in and helped solve problems by design personnel. For example, the quality accidents of steel in the large rolling mill plant, the welding accidents of crane beams, etc., were all promptly raised by the design personnel, which aroused the attention of all parties, and were solved closely relying on Soviet experts. In addition, the design personnel also worked with the construction units to jointly study and remedy the shortcomings of the concrete columns in the tool factory, which developed cracks after the roof trusses were hoisted, and the insufficient strength of the drainage pipe materials.

    4.  According to the progress of the project, timely put forward the necessary measures for the civil construction to be coordinated with the production design and public design, so that in the future, when installing production equipment and public works construction, the civil construction can minimize rework and modification. A prominent shortcoming in our design is that the civil construction drawings do not fully express the electrical, lighting, heating, ventilation, and production design requirements for civil construction. Therefore, during civil construction, necessary wall holes, trenches, and lintels are often omitted. Therefore, when constructing in places where wall holes are reserved, the design personnel should timely put forward specific conditions and drawings of other projects, and require the construction units to cooperate. For example, the production pipeline trench of the paint resin workshop must pass through the block stone foundation of the wall. If no holes are pre-reserved in the wall foundation, it will be extremely difficult to handle in the future. We promptly reminded the construction personnel of similar problems.

    We worked at the construction site for a total of five months and gained many experiences.

    First of all, these months of work have made us deeply feel that correct designs must be well implemented among the worker masses in order to be fully realized; therefore, it is very important to explain the design ideas and design content to the workers before construction. Our design adopts many Soviet advanced experiences, but the worker masses sometimes do not understand the superiority of advanced experiences and feel that new things are unreliable. This must be clearly explained to them.

    Design work is an important part of basic construction. It is necessary to do a good job in design work in order to avoid losses in basic construction. This is also an experience we gained from vivid examples after going to the construction site. Before going to the construction site, design personnel always felt that what they calculated and drew might not be realized, so they were not very serious when calculating and drawing. After arriving at the construction site, seeing that thousands of workers were working cautiously and enthusiastically based on what we calculated and drew, and that they had to find the design personnel to solve any problems they could not decide on before they could be at ease, this made us concretely realize how serious the impact of the shortcomings of our work was on practical work, thereby greatly strengthening our sense of responsibility.

    Drawings must not be late. This is also a deep understanding we gained after going to the construction site. Before going to the construction site, we always felt that a few days' delay in the drawings would not have much impact on the project. This time, we realized that if the drawings are issued late, the construction units will not have time to make a budget, and will not be able to do a good job of construction organization design and appropriately prepare materials. In fact, in order to ensure the start of construction, construction departments have to prepare materials in advance, but the result is that, in addition to some materials meeting the requirements of the construction drawings, the rest are either replacing small ones with large ones, causing waste, or replacing large ones with small ones, which is inconsistent with the design intent and affects quality. The Second Engineering Company of the Electric Power Bureau prepared materials that could not be used due to the uncertainty of the design, resulting in a backlog of more than 20 billion yuan. Some projects are also related to the season. When the suitable season comes for construction, there are no drawings. When the drawings come, it is the unsuitable season, and construction cannot be carried out. There are also some projects that have been prolonged due to the drawings not arriving early enough, which increased the project cost. We have also emphasized that construction units can make budgets based on the technical design, without waiting for the construction design. However, the discrepancies between our construction design and technical design accounted for more than 90 percent. If we really made budgets based on our technical design, the difference in materials, equipment, and labor would be astonishing, and the losses caused would be inestimable.

    Going to the construction site has also further strengthened our concept of cherishing national wealth. For example, more than 5,000 precast roofing panels in the foundry workshop, 90 percent of which were unusable due to poor construction quality, which we had originally decided to scrap. However, after going to the construction site and seeing with our own eyes that state property worth 800 to 900 million yuan was about to be lost, we put our minds to work and came up with a way to save more than 2,000 pieces. If the design personnel were not at the construction site, I am afraid that these precast panels would have been completely scrapped long ago.

    In short, our experience is that, under the current situation of low design standards, organizing design personnel to go deep into the construction site to discover problems and solve problems is indeed very beneficial.

    设计工作者应该深入到工地去
    第一机械工业部第四设计分局工程师  沈从龙
    正确的设计必须通过正确的施工才能实现；同时，也只有正确的设计才能保证施工的顺利进行。设计和施工的关系就是这样像唇齿相依一般的密切。所以，设计人员在设计的时候，必须很好地为施工部门考虑，尽量避免由于设计不切实际所引起的施工上的困难；在设计完成以后，又应该将自己的设计意图告诉施工人员，使他们深刻了解，以便贯彻到施工中去。
    过去，我们恰恰在这方面做得不够，以致给国家造成了很大的损失。譬如，去年十一月，我们对哈尔滨电机厂去年施工的工程进行了一次检查，就发现了五百多个问题。其中有些是由于设计人员粗枝大叶，考虑不周所造成的；有些是由于设计部门内各工种联系不够造成的；有些是由于设计迟缓，施工部门停工待图，图纸来了，不得不忙乱施工发生的错误；有些是由于施工部门赶进度，不重视质量，不按图施工造成的错误；有些是由于设计修改得太多，施工部门跟不上修改，于是对设计失去信心，只将图纸作为参考之用，实际施工时另干一套；有些是施工中发现图纸有问题，而施工部门不肯或不易与设计部门联系，不得不权宜处理；有些是施工部门找不到设计中所规定的材料，便自行决定以别种材料来代替，以致与设计意图不符；还有一些则是施工部门没有看清图纸，以致造成了错误。
    这些错误的暴露，使我们深切地体会到，在目前设计水平还不高，而基本建设工程又大量施工的时候，设计人员如不和施工部门密切配合，必将造成施工的错误和返工、窝工，影响工程的进度和质量。
    接受这些教训，今年我们在动手做施工图的时候，便广泛地征求了施工部门的意见，了解他们的要求，满足他们的需要。在普遍开工之后，又派遣了一个包括各工种设计人员的工作组，常驻工地工作，以进一步加强设计和施工的配合。
    下工地前，我们先进行了一些准备工作。
    首先是拟好工作组的工作计划，组织大家反复讨论，使大家明确下工地是为了更好地为施工服务。其次，选择了两个重点车间的施工设计，进行质量大检查。在检查中，发觉已发到工地的图纸上，竟存在着六百九十六个问题，其中属于设计错误的占百分之七十六。这说明了我们的设计是草率的，质量是低劣的，如果工地按照这些错误的图纸施工，必将造成严重的损失。这件事使我们越发感到了设计人员下工地的必要。此外，在施工图发到工地以前，我们还组织了各工种设计负责人员到施工单位去讲解施工图纸的内容。由于施工单位很重视这件事，对改进设计提出了许多宝贵的意见，使设计与施工的结合更加紧密了。
    我们到工地以后作了下面几件工作：
    一、随时纠正图纸上的错误。这些错误是多种多样的，有的是数字错误，有的是图纸不清楚，有的是属于设计原则上的，有的是各种设计配合方面的。例如锻工车间的屋架图上错了二十个数字，动力管路的弯管比地沟还大，搁不进去；铸工车间的暖气管和吊车梁相碰等等，这些错误如不及时纠正，必然会造成返工浪费或窝工损失。
    二、根据施工部门和材料部门的要求，对设计工作及时地适当地修正。如简化铆钉的规格，使铆钉的准备工作能够提前进行；空心砖改用煤渣水泥，便利了施工等等。
    三、检查工程质量和施工上的错误，及时提出意见，督促有关部门采取必要措施加以改进，或由设计人员直接参加，帮助解决。例如大型轧钢厂厂房的钢材质量事故，吊车梁焊缝事故等等，都是由设计人员及时提出，引起各方面重视，紧密地依靠苏联专家解决的。此外，设计人员还和施工单位共同研究，补救了工具厂混凝土柱子在屋架吊装后发生了裂缝，下水管材料强度不够等等缺点。
    四、根据工程进度，及时提出土建施工必须与生产设计及公用设计配合的必要措施，以便将来安装生产设备和公用工程施工时，土建方面尽量少返工和少修改。我们设计上一个突出的缺点是土建施工图上未全部表示电力，照明、暖气、通风和生产设计对土建的要求，因而在土建施工时，常常遗漏了必要的墙洞，地沟和过梁等。所以在预留墙孔的地方进行施工时，设计人员应及时提出具体条件和其他工程的图纸，要求施工单位加以配合。例如油漆树脂车间的生产管路地沟必须穿过墙的块石基础，如果不在墙基上预留洞口，将来处理时会极其困难。类似这种问题，我们都及时提醒了施工人员。
    我们在工地上，前后一共工作了五个月，得到的体会是很多的。
    首先，这几个月的工作使我们深深感到正确的设计必须很好地贯彻到工人群众中去，才能不折不扣地实现；因此在施工以前很好地向工人交代设计思想和设计内容，是十分重要的。我们的设计中采用了很多苏联的先进经验，但工人群众有时不了解先进经验的优越性，觉得新玩艺不可靠。这就必须很好地向他们解说清楚。
    设计工作是基本建设的重要环节，必须做好设计工作才有可能不使基本建设遭受损失，这也是我们下工地以后从生动的事例中得到的体会。未到工地以前，设计人员总觉得自己算的画的不一定会实现，因而在算和画的时候不太认真。到了工地以后，看到成千的劳动者就是根据我们所算的所画的在谨慎地热情地工作，遇到不能决定的问题，必须找设计人员解决才放心。这使我们具体地体会到了自己工作的缺点对实际工作有多么严重的影响，从而大大加强了自己的责任感。
    图纸晚不得，也是我们下工地以后才有了深刻的认识。未到工地以前，我们总觉得图纸晚几天对工程的影响不大。这次才体会到，图纸发得晚，施工单位就来不及做预算，就无法做好施工组织设计和适当地准备材料。事实上，施工部门为了保证开工，不得不在事先准备材料，但结果除掉部分材料能符合施工图要求之外，其余的不是以大代小造成浪费，就是以小替大与设计意图不符，影响质量。电工局第二工程公司由于设计没有肯定，准备了材料用不上，积压了二百多亿元。还有些工程是与季节有关系的，适宜季节可以施工时，没有图纸，等图纸来了，又碰上不适宜的季节，不能施工。还有些工程就因为图纸不能早日到齐，拖长了施工过程，增加了工程成本。我们还曾经强调过施工单位可以根据技术设计做预算，不必等待施工设计。可是我们的施工设计和技术设计有出入的地方竟占百分之九十以上，如果真的根据我们的技术设计做预算，材料、设备和人工的差额一定大得惊人，造成的损失将无法估计。
    下工地以后也使我们进一步加强了爱护国家财富的观念。如铸工车间五千多块预制屋顶板，由于施工质量低劣，百分之九十不能用，我们原已决定作废。但是，下工地以后，亲眼看到价值八、九亿元的国家财产要遭到损失，就开动脑筋想出办法，挽救了二千多块。如果设计人员不在工地，恐怕这些预制板早就全部作废了。
    总之，我们的体会，在目前设计水平不高的情况下，组织设计人员深入工地去发现问题，解决问题，确实有很大的好处。
