Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 24th: South Korean POWs who have not received explanations, in front of the Neutral Nations personnel and reporters from both sides this morning, condemned the "United Nations Command" for having "no sincerity" in allowing them to return home to live peaceful lives. They demanded to be given explanations. However, in order to forcibly detain Korean and Chinese POWs, the US side unilaterally announced that the explanation period had expired last night.

Today, three South Korean POW representatives, speaking for 103 South Korean POWs who were deprived of the right to hear explanations and apply for repatriation, spoke with an affiliated body of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. They said: "The US side waited until December 2nd – about 70 days after the start of the explanation period – before sending their Syngman Rhee puppet officers to talk to us. During these talks, the puppet officers refused to clarify our doubts about repatriation and help us make a decision." These POWs said that if the US side genuinely wanted the POWs to return home, they would not have interrupted the explanation work for nine days and, after only one hour of broadcasting yesterday, announced the end of the explanation. These POWs said: "All of this further proves the 'United Nations Command' has no sincerity."

The US side broadcast to them yesterday, saying that "a few bad elements" were obstructing the repatriation of POWs in their camp. The POWs denounced this statement as a "fabrication" and an "insult." They protested the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission allowing the US side to broadcast such insulting words to them. One POW representative told the Neutral Nations personnel: "The actual situation is that when we were still in the POW camps along the Yalu River, the personnel of the Korean and Chinese side who were detaining us repeatedly advised everyone here to go back. But we ourselves decided to stay." The POW representatives also said that the POWs welcome the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to investigate the actual situation in the POW camps to expose this lie.

The chairman of the affiliated body promised to convey their opinions to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.

The conversation took place in a wooden house next to a rice paddy in the custody camp. During the conversation, the POWs were consistently polite and spoke quietly. They listened attentively to the chairman's speech and took notes. After the meeting, they shook hands with the Neutral Nations personnel to express their gratitude.

    未听解释的南朝鲜战俘代表与中立国人员谈话
    斥责美方破坏解释工作要求继续听取解释
   【新华社开城二十四日电】松谷里的未听解释的南朝鲜战俘在今天上午当着中立国人员和双方记者的面，斥责“联合国军司令部”“毫无诚意”使他们遣返回家过和平生活。他们要求向他们进行解释。但是，美方为了强迫扣留朝中战俘，片面地宣布解释期限已于昨晚满期。
    今天，三名南朝鲜战俘代表一百零三名被剥夺听取解释和申请遣返的权利的南朝鲜战俘，与中立国遣返委员会的一个附属机构谈了话。他们说：“美方一直等到十二月二日——解释时期开始以后约七十天——才派遣他们的李承晚傀儡军官来向我们谈话。在进行这种谈话时，傀儡军官拒绝澄清我们对于遣返问题的怀疑，和帮助我们作出决定。”这些战俘说：如果美方真心希望战俘遣返回家，他们就不会中断解释工作达九天之久，并且在昨天仅进行了一小时的广播以后就宣布解释结束了。这些战俘说：“这一切情形进一步证明‘联合国军司令部’毫无诚意。”
    昨天美方对他们广播说：“少数坏蛋”阻挠他们的营场中的战俘的遣返。战俘们斥责这种说法是一种“谰言”和“侮辱”。他们抗议中立国遣返委员会允许美方向他们广播这种侮辱性的广播词。一位战俘代表对中立国人员说：“实际情况是，当我们还在鸭绿江沿岸的战俘营里的时候，拘留我们的朝中方面的人员曾几次劝我们这里的每一个人回去。但是我们自己决定留下来。”战俘代表们还说：战俘们欢迎中立国遣返委员会对战俘营中的实际情况进行调查，以揭穿这种谎言。
    附属机构的主席答应向中立国遣返委员会转达他们的意见。
    这次谈话是在看管营地的一块稻田旁边的一所木头房子里进行的。在谈话的过程中，战俘们始终很有礼貌地安静地说话。他们聚精会神地听主席的讲话，并且还做记录。在会议结束以后，他们还向中立国人员握手致意。
