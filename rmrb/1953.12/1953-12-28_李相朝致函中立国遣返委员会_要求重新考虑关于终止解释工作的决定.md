Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 27th. Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao, Chief Delegate of the Korean-Chinese side to the Military Armistice Commission, wrote to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on the 27th, resolutely demanding that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission reconsider the decision by the majority of its members to terminate the explanatory work, so that the Korean-Chinese side can carry out ninety days of explanations, allowing all prisoners of war the opportunity to hear explanations and exercise their right to be repatriated.

Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao emphasized: The various provisions of the "Terms of Reference" are an interconnected whole and cannot be arbitrarily separated. The "Terms of Reference" guarantees the basic spirit that the side to which the prisoners of war belong has the freedom and convenience to carry out ninety days of explanations, so that all prisoners of war have the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated, and Article 8 of the "Terms of Reference" regarding the specific provisions for explanation is an indispensable prerequisite for Article 11 of the "Terms of Reference." The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission not only failed to take the necessary measures to ensure ninety days of explanatory work, but also, after the explanatory work resumed for three days due to the efforts of the Korean-Chinese side, declared the termination of the explanatory work under the pretext that the provisions of Article 11 of the "Terms of Reference" are so-called mandatory provisions. The decision of the majority of the members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission is obviously incompatible with the neutral stance of the neutral nations.

Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao then pointed out: Because the US side deliberately delayed the construction of explanation facilities, instructed Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee special agents to obstruct and sabotage the explanation work, and opposed the implementation of the regulations for isolating prisoners of war, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has never taken effective measures to break the control of the special agents over the prisoners of war and guarantee the necessary conditions for the explanation work. The explanation work of the Korean-Chinese side could neither start on schedule nor continue uninterruptedly. Therefore, during the ninety-day period up to December 23, the Korean-Chinese side only had an incomplete ten days to carry out explanation work, and more than 87 percent of the prisoners of war had not heard a single explanation. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission cannot sit idly by the fact that nearly 20,000 of our captured personnel have not heard the explanations and must guarantee that the Korean-Chinese side carries out ninety days of explanations in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 of the "Terms of Reference."

    李相朝致函中立国遣返委员会
    要求重新考虑关于终止解释工作的决定
    【新华社开城二十七日电】军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将二十七日写信给中立国遣返委员会，坚决要求中立国遣返委员会重新考虑其多数委员终止解释工作的决定，使朝中方面得以进行九十天的解释，以便全部战俘有听取解释和行使被遣返权利的机会。
    李相朝中将着重指出：“职权范围”的各项规定是一个互相关联的整体，不容加以任意割裂。“职权范围”保证战俘所属一方有自由与便利进行九十天的解释，使全部战俘有机会行使其被遣返权利的基本精神，及“职权范围”第八款关于解释的具体规定，是“职权范围”第十一款的不可缺少的前提。中立国遣返委员会不但没有采取必要措施保证九十天的解释工作，却反而在解释工作在朝中方面的努力下恢复三天后，藉口“职权范围”第十一款的规定是所谓强制性的规定，宣布终止解释工作。中立国遣返委员会多数委员的这一决定，显然是与中立国的公正立场不相容的。
    李相朝中将接着指出：由于美方故意拖延解释设备的修建，指使蒋李特务阻挠破坏解释工作，反对实施隔离战俘的规定，而中立国遣返委员会一直没有采取有效措施打破特务对战俘的控制，保证解释工作的必要条件，朝中方面的解释工作既未能按期开始，又不能不间断地一直进行下去。因此，在到十二月二十三日为止的九十天期间，朝中方面只有不完整的十天得以进行解释工作，百分之八十七以上的战俘没有听过一次解释。中立国遣返委员会不能坐视将近两万名我方被俘人员没有听取解释的事实，必须按照“职权范围”第八款的规定保证朝中方面进行九十天的解释。
