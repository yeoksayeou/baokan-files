    The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government
    Measures for Land Requisition for National Construction
    (Passed at the 192nd Session of the Government Administration Council on November 5, 1953)
    Article 1: These measures are specifically formulated to meet the needs of national construction and to handle land requisition for national construction cautiously and appropriately.
    Article 2: These measures shall apply to all land required for the construction of national defense projects, factories and mines, railways, transportation, water conservancy projects, municipal construction, and other economic and cultural construction projects.
    Article 3: The basic principles for land requisition for national construction are: firstly, to ensure the land necessary for national construction based on the actual needs of national construction; secondly, to take care of the vital interests of the local people, and to properly resettle those whose land is requisitioned for their production and livelihood. Wherever there is wasteland or vacant land that can be utilized, it should be utilized as much as possible, and the cultivated land and fertile fields of the people should not be requisitioned or requisitioned less. Projects that are not urgently needed at present should not be undertaken. If a project is needed, but those whose land is requisitioned cannot be resettled for the time being, it should be undertaken after proper resettlement, or another site should be selected.
    Article 4: For all land requisition, the land-using unit shall, based on the principle of economical land use, submit a land requisition plan, and after it is approved by its higher-level leading authority according to the following provisions regarding approval authority, it shall be transferred to the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government or the Administrative Committee of the Greater Administrative Area or the People's Government of the province, city, or county for verification and promulgation:
    A. Land for national construction undertakings shall be approved by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government after being verified by the State Planning Commission of the Central People's Government;
    B. For local construction undertakings, land use of 5,000 mu or more, or relocation of 300 households or more, shall be approved by the Administrative Committee of the Greater Administrative Area; land use of less than 5,000 mu but more than 1,000 mu, or relocation of fewer than 300 households but more than 50 households, shall be approved by the People's Government of the province (city); land use of less than 1,000 mu, or relocation of fewer than 50 households, shall be approved by the County People's Government;
    C. National defense construction projects shall be verified by the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government, the Greater Military Region, or the Provincial Military Region according to their size, and transferred to the Government Administration Council or the local People's Government for approval.
    When submitting the land requisition plan for approval, the land-using unit shall provide detailed explanations of the land's location, position (with a map), and quantity, the number of households and population involved in the land use, the attachments and crops on the land, and the compensation and resettlement plan for those whose land is requisitioned, and submit them together with the opinions of the local government where the land is located. The higher-level authorities shall also carefully verify the information, adhering to the spirit of economical land use.
    Article 5: After the land requisition plan completes the approval procedures stipulated in Article 4, the land-using unit shall, in coordination with the local People's Government and the CCP Committee (or directly under the local Party and government leadership for some small units), explain the situation to the local people, announce the specific measures for compensating and resettling those whose land is requisitioned, and give the masses the necessary preparation time, so that the masses consciously obey the national interest and the long-term interests of the people under the condition that their current vital interests are properly taken care of, and then the requisition can be determined and construction can begin. If a large amount of land is requisitioned, a large number of residents are relocated, or even an entire village is relocated, thorough preparations should be made among the local people before convening a people's congress to discuss and resolve the matter.
    Article 6: Before the land is determined to be requisitioned, if it is necessary to conduct surveying, drilling, and other work to investigate whether the land is suitable, the land-using unit shall also report to the People's Government of the province, city, or county for approval according to the scope of the survey, and in coordination with the local People's Government and the CCP Committee, explain the situation clearly to the people (or directly under the local Party and government leadership for some small units) and obtain their consent before proceeding. If the local people suffer losses due to this survey, appropriate compensation shall also be given.
    Article 7: In case of emergency needs such as temporary disaster relief, when there is not enough time to prepare the approval procedures for land requisition, construction may be started on the land while reporting to the local People's Government and promptly completing the requisition procedures during construction.
    Article 8: The compensation fee for the requisitioned land in rural areas shall be discussed and determined by the local People's Government in conjunction with the land-using unit, the Farmers' Association, and the original owner (or user) of the land or the representative elected by the original owner (or user). The general standard is the total value of the land's production in the most recent three to five years, and special land may be handled flexibly as appropriate. If there is other public land that can be allocated, the farmers whose land is allocated shall also be given a relocation subsidy. The compensation for houses, wells, trees, and other attachments and planted crops on the requisitioned land shall be based on the current situation jointly determined by the local People's Government, the land-using unit, the Farmers' Association, and the original owner and user of the land (or the representative elected by the original owner and user), and shall be compensated at a fair and reasonable price.
    Article 9: When requisitioning public land and state-owned land in urban suburbs, the farmers who cultivate the land shall also be given appropriate subsidies based on their living conditions. The attachments and crops on the land shall be handled in accordance with Article 8, paragraph 2.
    For public welfare undertakings that originally relied on income from public land to maintain their operations, if they still need to continue after the land is requisitioned and lack funding, the local People's Government shall allocate funds from the department in charge's operating expenses according to the nature of the undertaking. If it is impossible to allocate funds, the matter shall be promptly reported to the higher-level People's Government for resolution.
    Article 10: When it is necessary to relocate graves due to land requisition, the tomb owners must be notified in advance to relocate the graves, and appropriate relocation expenses shall be given, and local customs and habits shall be taken into consideration for proper handling. Graves with no owners shall be relocated by the land-using unit. Those who have no land for relocation shall be assisted in finding land for relocation. The graves of martyrs shall be relocated properly, and the local county (city) People's Government shall be notified.
    Historical sites and scenic spots within the requisitioned land area shall be preserved as much as possible without hindering construction.
    Article 11: When constructing projects, if it is necessary to temporarily use land outside the requisitioned area as a material storage site and temporary transportation road, the land-using unit shall negotiate with the owner (or user) of the land for temporary borrowing or temporary leasing by signing a contract.
    If the owners (or users) of nearby land that has not been requisitioned suffer losses due to the construction of the project, they shall also be given due compensation.
    Article 12: If the use of requisitioned land is stopped due to changes in circumstances during exploration and construction, or if the exploration results prove that it is not suitable, it may be returned to the original owner (or user). If the original owner (or user) has suffered certain losses due to the exploration and construction, appropriate compensation shall also be given.
    If the requisitioned land is not used for construction for more than one growing season and to facilitate production, farmers should still be allowed to continue cultivation temporarily, provided that it does not hinder construction use.
    Article 13: After the land cultivated by farmers is requisitioned, the local People's Government must be responsible for assisting in solving the problem of land needed for their continued production or assisting them in changing careers, so that they are not displaced. The land-using unit shall also, in coordination with the government labor department and the trade union, absorb them into work as much as possible within the scope permitted by the conditions.
    Article 14: The compensation fee for the requisitioned land and its attached houses, etc., shall be collected by the original owner or his legal agent from the land-using unit upon presentation of the certificate of ownership or the certificate from the local township or higher People's Government (which may be distributed by the local People's Government). If the certificate is lost or the certificate is not presented during the period when the land-using unit is distributing the compensation fee and the local township or higher People's Government cannot prove it, or if no one comes to claim the compensation fee during the period when the land-using unit is distributing the compensation fee, the land-using unit shall send the compensation fee to the local People's Government for safekeeping, which shall be kept for one year. If the original owner or his legal agent comes to claim it within one year, or submits a supplementary certificate that is recognized by the land administration agency or certified by the township People's Government, it may be reissued. If no one claims it or cannot provide a certificate to claim it after the deadline, the local People's Government shall submit the compensation fee it manages on behalf of the government to the state treasury and notify the land-using unit.
    Article 15: If all the land and houses recorded on the certificate of ownership of the land and houses of the original owner have been requisitioned, the certificate shall be handed over to the local People's Government for cancellation when the compensation fee is collected. If not all of it has been requisitioned, the local People's Government shall indicate the requisitioned part on the certificate when the compensation fee is collected and return it to the owner or issue a new certificate. If the remaining land after the requisition is not much, and the original owner is unwilling to use it or it is inconvenient to dispose of, it may be requisitioned together with the approval of the local People's Government.
    All land requisitioned with the approval of the People's Government in accordance with these measures shall be exempt from deed tax when the property rights are transferred.
    Article 16: After the compensation fee has been fully distributed, the land-using unit shall draw a map and compile a register of the requisitioned land in duplicate, and send it to the local county (city) People's Government for record and stamping, one copy to be kept by the land-using unit and one copy to be kept by the county (city) People's Government for reference.
    Article 17: When land is requisitioned in urban areas due to the needs of national construction, the houses and other attachments on the land shall be compensated at a fair and reasonable price based on the current situation jointly determined by the local People's Government, the land-using unit, and the original owner and user (or the representative elected by the original owner and user). If the ownership of the land base and the house belongs to the same person, the land base will not be compensated separately; if it belongs to two people, the land base shall be compensated at the discretion of the land base owner's living conditions.
    Vacant land in urban areas may be requisitioned free of charge.
    Agricultural land leased by landlords in urban areas may be requisitioned free of charge, but the farmers who lease the land shall be compensated for the crops and attachments on the leased land in accordance with Article 8, paragraph 2.
    When agricultural land cultivated by farmers in urban areas is requisitioned, the compensation method shall be handled in accordance with Article 8.
    After the land cultivated or leased by farmers in urban areas is requisitioned, their production and living problems shall be properly resettled in accordance with Article 13.
    Article 18: The ownership of all requisitioned land belongs to the state. When the land-using unit does not need it, it shall be returned to the state and shall not be transferred.
    Article 19: Private economic enterprises and private cultural and educational undertakings may apply to the People's Government above the province (city) level, and after obtaining approval, the local People's Government shall requisition land on their behalf with reference to these measures.
    Article 20: The land requisition measures promulgated in various places shall be repealed after the promulgation of these measures.
    The People's Governments of all provinces (cities) may formulate specific implementation measures for their respective regions based on these measures, and submit them to the Administrative Committee of the Greater Administrative Area for approval and implementation, and report them to the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government for record.
    Article 21: In ethnic minority autonomous regions, the measures for land requisition for national construction shall be formulated by the autonomous region government, submitted to the People's Government above the province level for approval and implementation, and reported to the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government for record. Before the separate measures for autonomous regions are formulated, they shall be handled with reference to these measures in accordance with local ethnic customs.
    Article 22: These measures shall be approved and promulgated by the Chairman of the Central People's Government after being passed by the Government Administration Council, and shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.

    中央人民政府政务院
    关于国家建设征用土地办法
    （一九五三年十一月五日政务院第一百九十二次政务会议通过）
    第一条  为适应国家建设的需要，慎重地妥善地处理国家建设征用土地问题，特制定本办法。
    第二条  凡兴建国防工程、厂矿、铁路、交通、水利工程、市政建设及其他经济、文化建设等所需用之土地，均依本办法征用之。
    第三条  国家建设征用土地的基本原则是：既应根据国家建设的确实需要，保证国家建设所必需的土地，又应照顾当地人民的切身利益，必须对土地被征用者的生产和生活有妥善的安置。凡属有荒地、空地可资利用者，应尽量利用，而不征用或少征用人民的耕地良田。凡属目前并不十分需要的工程，不应举办。凡虽属需要，而对土地被征用者一时无法安置，则应俟安置妥善后再行举办，或另行择地举办。
    第四条  凡征用土地，均应由用地单位本节约用地的原则，提出征用土地计划书，按业务系统报经其上级领导机关批准后，依关于批准权限的下列规定，分别转请中央人民政府政务院或大行政区行政委员会或省、市、县人民政府核准公布征用之：
    甲、全国性的建设事业用地，经中央人民政府国家计划委员会核定，由中央人民政府政务院批准；
    乙、地方性建设事业，用地在五千亩以上或迁移居民三百户以上者，由大行政区行政委员会批准；用地不足五千亩而在一千亩以上者或迁移居民不足三百户而在五十户以上者，由省（市）人民政府批准；用地不足一千亩，或迁移居民不足五十户者，由县人民政府批准；
    丙、国防建筑工程，分别大小经中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会、大军区或省军区核定，移送政务院或地方人民政府批准。
    征用土地的计划书，送请上级批核时，均应详细说明用地的属境、位置（附图标明）和数量，用地所涉及的户数和人口数，用地上的附着物和农作物，以及对土地被征用者的补偿安置计划，并连同用地所在的地方政府意见一并报核。上级机关审批时，亦须掌握节约用地的精神仔细核实。
    第五条  征用土地计划书完成第四条规定的批准手续后，用地单位应协同当地人民政府和中共党委（有些小的单位则直接在当地党政领导下），向当地人民进行解释工作，宣布对土地被征用者补偿安置的各项具体办法，并给群众以必要的准备时间，使群众在当前切身利益得到适当照顾的条件下，自觉地服从国家利益，服从人民的长远利益，然后始得确定征用，进行施工。如征用大量土地，迁移大量居民甚至迁移整个村庄者，应先在当地人民中切实做好准备工作，然后召开人民代表大会讨论解决之。
    第六条  在土地未确定征用前，为勘查该土地是否适用，须进行测量、钻探等工作时，亦应由用地单位视勘测范围，分别报经省、市、县人民政府核准后，协同当地人民政府和中共党委向人民解释清楚（有些小的单位则直接在当地党政领导下），取得人民同意后始得进行。如因此项测探工作，使当地人民蒙受损失时，亦须予以适当补偿。
    第七条  如遇临时抢险等紧急需要，不及备办征用土地的批准手续时，得一面先行进入地内施工，一面报告当地人民政府，并在施工中及时补办征用手续。
    第八条  被征用土地的补偿费，在农村中应由当地人民政府会同用地单位、农民协会及土地原所有人（或原使用人）或由原所有人（或原使用人）推出之代表评议商定之。一般土地以其最近三年至五年产量的总值为标准，特殊土地得酌情变通处理之。如另有公地可以调剂，亦须发给被调剂土地的农民以迁移补助费。对被征用土地上的房屋、水井、树木等附着物及种植的农作物，均应根据当地人民政府、用地单位、农民协会及土地原所有人和原使用人（或原所有人和原使用人推出之代表）会同勘定之现状，按公平合理的代价予以补偿。
    第九条  征用公有土地及城市郊区国有土地时，对耕种该土地的农民亦应依其生活情况适当予以补助。该土地上的附着物和农作物同样按第八条第二项规定办理。
    对于原来依靠公有土地收入维持的公益事业，在该项土地被征用后仍须续办而经费无着者，应由当地人民政府按该事业性质分别在主管部门的事业经费内开支。如无法开支时，应及时报请上级人民政府解决。
    第十条  凡因征用土地而须迁移坟墓者，必须事前通知坟主迁移，发给适当的迁葬费用，并应照顾当地的风俗习惯妥善处理。坟墓无主者应由用地单位代迁。对无地迁葬者应协助找地迁葬。对烈士的坟墓更应妥善迁移，并应通知当地县（市）人民政府。
    在已被征用的土地范围内的名胜古迹，应在不妨碍建设的条件下尽力保存之。
    第十一条  凡修建工程，须临时使用征用范围以外之土地作为材料堆存场所及临时运输道路等用途者，应与该项土地所有人（或使用人）协商临时借用，或订立契约临时租用。
    凡因修建工程而使附近未被征用之土地蒙受损失者，对该项土地所有人（或使用人）亦应给以应得的补偿。
    第十二条  已征用之土地在勘探施工过程中，如因情况变化停止使用，或勘探结果证明不合用者，可以退还原所有人（或原使用人）。如原所有人(或原使用人）已因勘探施工而蒙受一定损失者，亦应给以适当补偿。
    已征用的土地，如在农作物的生长时间一季以上暂不修建，并为了有利生产，在不妨碍建设用途的条件下，应仍准农民暂时继续耕种。
    第十三条  农民耕种的土地被征用后，当地人民政府必须负责协助解决其继续生产所需之土地或协助其转业，不得使其流离失所。用地单位亦应协同政府劳动部门和工会在条件许可的范围内，尽可能吸收其参加工作。
    第十四条  被征用的土地及其附着的房屋等应由原所有人或其合法的代理人凭所有权的证状或当地乡以上人民政府的证明，向用地单位领取补偿费（可由当地人民政府代发）。如证状遗失或在用地单位发补偿费期间未能提出证状而当地乡以上人民政府又不能证明者，以及在用地单位发补偿费期间无人前来承领者，用地单位应将补偿费送交当地人民政府代为保管，保管期间一年。如原所有人或其合法的代理人在一年内前来承领，或补提证状经地政机关认可或乡人民政府证明者，得予补发。逾期无人请领或不能提证请领时，当地人民政府即将所代管的补偿费报缴国库，并通知用地单位。
    第十五条  原所有人的土地房屋所有权的证状上所载之土地房屋，如全数已被征用，此项证状在领取补偿费时即应交与当地人民政府注销。未全部被征用者，则于领取补偿费时，由当地人民政府在该证状上注明被征用部分后发还本人或换发新证。如征用后所余土地无多，原所有人不愿使用或不便处理时，可经当地人民政府核准，一并征用。
    凡按本办法，经人民政府批准征用之土地，其产权转移时，一律免纳契税。
    第十六条  补偿费发放竣事后，用地单位应将征用的土地，绘图造册，一式两份，送当地县（市）人民政府备案盖印，一份由用地单位收执，一份即存县（市）人民政府备查。第十七条  凡因国家建设的需要，在城市市区内征用土地时，地上的房屋及其他附着物等，应根据当地人民政府、用地单位及原所有人和原使用人（或原所有人和原使用人推出之代表）会同勘定之现状，按公平合理的代价予以补偿。地基与房屋的产权同属一人者，地基部分不另补偿；分属两人者，视地基所有人的生活情况酌情补偿之。
    市区内的空地得无偿征用。
    地主在市区内出租的农地得无偿征用，但对租种此项土地的农民，应对其在此项租入土地上的农作物及附着物等按第八条第二项的规定予以补偿。
    征用农民在市区内自耕的农地时，补偿办法按第八条规定办理。
    市区内农民自耕或租种的土地被征用后，其生产、生活问题应按第十三条的规定予以妥善安置。
    第十八条  凡征用之土地，产权属于国家。用地单位不需用时，应交还国家，不得转让。
    第十九条  私营经济企业和私营文教事业用地，得向省（市）以上人民政府提出申请，获得批准后由当地人民政府援用本办法，代为征用。
    第二十条  各地已颁行的征用土地办法于本办法公布后即行废止。
    各省（市）人民政府得根据本办法制定当地的具体实施办法，报请大行政区行政委员会批准实施，并报中央人民政府政务院备案。
    第二十一条  在少数民族自治区，国家建设征用土地办法，由自治区政府制定，报请省以上人民政府批准施行，并报中央人民政府政务院备案。在自治区的单行办法未制定前，应根据当地的民族习惯，参照本办法变通办理之。
    第二十二条  本办法经政务会议通过，报请中央人民政府主席批准公布，自公布之日起实行。
