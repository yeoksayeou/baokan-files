Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, December 26th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru delivered a speech in the People's Assembly on the 23rd, at the beginning of the debate on foreign policy issues.

    Prime Minister Nehru said: "We are in favor of cooperation between countries - large and small." He said, "Now, some people often talk about so-called 'Asianism'... I don't know what people have in mind when they talk about 'Asianism,' because I'm simply not clear on what it means... But when I think along different lines, it has a certain meaning for me. In addition to the geographical factors that bring these countries closer together, in addition to cultural and other contacts (which often last two or three thousand years or more), there is a very important point, and that is the long-term common experience of these Asian countries - the common experience of being controlled for a long time and common suffering. Due to this common experience, especially in the past few hundred years, or what might be called the Asian 'colonial centuries,' we have become closer to each other spiritually - you might say psychologically and morally. Therefore, we can understand each other better to some extent, even though we may be completely isolated from each other due to language and other ways of life."
    Speaking about the Korean issue, Nehru said: The situation in Korea is a matter of great importance. It is important because it is important in its essence and may well affect world peace or war. "It is especially important to us because we are closely related to it in a variety of ways." Because India is a member of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. Second, India is the chairman of the committee. Third, India is also responsible for guarding the prisoners of war. Nehru said:
    "The ninety days (for explanation) expire today. Therefore, in a sense, today is a turning point in the Korean situation."
    Nehru said: The purpose of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission is to give prisoners of war the time, opportunity, and facilities to decide what they want to do.
      "Of course, under normal circumstances - I don't think this kind of problem has happened before - after an armistice or ceasefire or peace is achieved, prisoners of war naturally return to their home countries. But undoubtedly, some difficulties have arisen this time. They have been arguing about this for a year. That fact alone shows that there are difficulties."
    Nehru said: "There are ninety days, and these prisoners of war should be provided with facilities to listen to explanations, and then they can make decisions. It was also stipulated that those who remained in the following thirty days would be considered by the political conference, which people previously hoped would be formed before that period. Not only on the issue of prisoners of war, but also on other very important issues, the political conference is a very important part of this agreement."
    Nehru said: "That is to say, the political conference has thirty days to consider this issue; and another thirty days - if I may say so - to settle things. That is to say, ninety days plus thirty days is one hundred and twenty days, plus another thirty days, for a total of one hundred and fifty days."
    Nehru said: "The ninety days expire today. However, in the course of these ninety days, what was originally intended to be done was not done, so difficulties arose. The ninety days were for explanation work. However, the explanation work did not even begin when it should have started. ... After about twenty days, the explanation work began. In this way, about twenty days of the ninety days were wasted simply waiting for the construction of houses, the erection of tents, or the provision of equipment. When the explanation work actually started, various difficulties arose... The explanation work started for two or three days, then it stopped, a stalemate arose, and then some other things happened... As a result, only a small part of the ninety days was used for this explanation work. Now this period has passed."
    Nehru said: "If the explanation work can be carried out and produce results, there should be no difficulty in extending the period to end that work. Naturally, if extending the period only prolongs the stalemate, then extending it is meaningless; but if it is possible to really end this matter, then there should be no difficulty, and there should be no great reason to oppose extending the period. ... But if a few more weeks can solve this problem more satisfactorily, then, undoubtedly, in my opinion, insisting on that pound of flesh (from Shakespeare's play - translator's note) - if I may use such an analogy - is a very rigid, literal, and rather stingy interpretation."
    Nehru then said: "Since the second period of thirty days has now begun, or will begin tomorrow (December 24), other difficulties have arisen. During this period, the political conference must be convened and decide these issues. But the political conference does not yet exist. It has not been formed, let alone convened. No one can know for sure whether it will be formed. I still hope and somewhat expect that the political conference will eventually be formed. But it does not exist now.
    So, who will consider the fate of the prisoners of war who have not returned home? It must be done by the political conference. The political conference does not yet exist. So, obviously, something that is an important part of the agreement between the two commands has not been formed. This is a big loophole in the agreement. How to fill it? ...
    If both parties reach an agreement, and difficulties arise in the implementation of that agreement, then it should obviously be considered by the relevant parties - in the current situation, the two commands - and the agreement should be changed, or a new agreement should be reached."
    Nehru said: "If you say that on a certain day, that is, on the one hundred and twentieth day - around January 23, according to the terms of the agreement, these prisoners of war will be restored - whatever the wording - to civilian status - whatever that really means, then what will happen overnight between December 23 and January 23? Now there are twenty thousand or twenty-five thousand people. If we decide to do so, we may simply withdraw our guard troops. Are we going to push those prisoners of war living in the demilitarized neutral zone out of the barracks? Or do we hand them over to others? Various extraordinary and difficult problems arise. Even without talking about the principles involved, this is not a simple matter."
    Emphasizing the responsibility that the United Nations should bear in the current situation, Nehru said: The General Assembly should study this issue and try to seek some solution, or put forward some suggestions or plans for this; doing so is "correct."
    He went on to say: "This issue had been raised there, but it was considered inappropriate to have such a discussion at that time. Therefore, the United Nations General Assembly adjourned. The United Nations General Assembly can reconvene at any time, of course, with the consent of a majority of member states. They have set February 9 as the date for the meeting. But under certain circumstances they have determined, the Assembly can be reconvened earlier. One point is extremely important, and that is that the Korean situation should not evolve naturally as some people imagine, and that this issue should not simply be handled by military commanders, and that the United Nations General Assembly should use its thoughts and wisdom as much as possible to solve this problem."
    Nehru said: According to his understanding, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission "intends to report to both commands in the near future on the issue of the ninety-day period, pointing out the difficulties they have encountered, how they have been unable to fully fulfill the responsibilities entrusted to them, and requesting both commands to change the previous agreement, or reach some agreement, or express their opinions on how the issue should be handled."
    Nehru said: "I hope that even at the current stage it is still possible for both commands to reach some agreement on what should be done now, either by extending the period somewhat, or by taking any other measures, so that we may be able to break this deadlock without having to face various complicated and difficult problems a month later or longer. The United Nations General Assembly may meet on February 9, as they have scheduled, or even earlier if necessary. Without a doubt, there, or even earlier, the Indian government will fully express its views on all these issues."

### 尼赫鲁在印度人民院关于战俘问题的演说

    尼赫鲁在印度人民院关于战俘问题的演说
   【新华社新德里二十六日电】印度总理尼赫鲁二十三日在人民院开始进行外交问题辩论时发表演说。
    尼赫鲁总理说：“我们赞成各国——大国和小国——之间的合作。”他说，“现在，常有一些人谈起所谓‘亚洲主义’……我不知道人们谈到‘亚洲主义’时想的是什么，因为我根本不清楚它意味着什么……但是当我沿着不同的思路思考时，它对我却有某种意义。除了使这些国家互相接近的地理因素外，除了文化上和其他方面的接触外（这种接触往往持续两三千年或更长的时间），还有着很重要的一点，这就是这些亚洲国家的长期共同经验——长期受人控制的共同经验和共同痛苦。由于这种共同经验，特别是在过去几百年中，或者可以称之为亚洲‘殖民世纪’中，我们已在精神上——你们或许可以说是心理上和道义上——彼此更为靠近。因此我们彼此之间可以在某种程度上有较好的了解，虽然我们可能由于言语和其他生活方式的隔阂而彼此处于完全隔离的状态。”
    尼赫鲁在谈到朝鲜问题时说：朝鲜的情势是具有极大重要性的问题之一。它之所以重要是因为它在本质上就具有重要性，并且很可能影响世界的和平或战争。“它对我们尤其重要，因为我们在多种多样的方式下与它发生密切关系。”因为印度是中立国遣返委员会的一员。其次，印度是该委员会的主席。第三，印度还负责看管着战俘。尼赫鲁说：
  “九十天（的解释期限）在今天满期了。因此，在某种意义上，今天是朝鲜这种局势的转折点。”
    尼赫鲁说：中立国遣返委员会的目的是要给战俘以时间、机会和便利条件，让他们决定他们希望怎样做。
      “当然，在正常情况下——我认为在以往并没有发生过这种问题——休战或停战或和平实现之后，战俘就自然而然地回到他们祖国去。但是，无疑地，这一次却发生了一些困难。他们为这件事争了一年。单单这个事实就说明是有困难的。”
    尼赫鲁说：“有九十天的时间，应向这些战俘提供便利，使他们听取解释，他们然后可以作出决定。当时并规定在接着的三十天中留下的人将由政治会议加以考虑，先前人们希望政治会议在那个期间以前能够形成。不但就战俘问题来说，而且就其他各种非常重要的问题来说，政治会议都是这个协定的非常重要的一部分。”
    尼赫鲁说：“这就是说政治会议有三十天的时间来考虑这个问题；另外还有三十天——如果我可以这样说的话——来把事情安顿完毕。这就是说九十天加三十天是一百二十天，另外有三十天，一共是一百五十天。”
    尼赫鲁说：“九十天在今天就满期了。但是，在这九十天的过程中，原来打算做的事情都没有做到，因此就发生了困难。九十天是供进行解释工作用的。可是解释工作在应该开始的时间甚至还没有开始。……过了二十天左右，解释工作才开始。这样，九十天中就有二十天左右浪费在单单等候修建房舍、架设帐篷或提供设备上面了。而解释工作实际开始时，各种各样的困难又发生了……解释工作开始进行了两三天，跟着就停顿了，僵局产生了，跟着又发生一些别的事情……结果，在九十天中，只有很小一部分时间是用来进行这种解释工作的。现在这个期限却过去了。”
    尼赫鲁说：“如果解释工作能够进行并产生结果，延长期限以结束那一工作，就不应当有困难。自然，如果延长期限只是延长僵局，那么延长就没有意义；但如果有可能真的结束这件事，那就应当没有困难，就应当没有很大理由反对延长期限。……但如果多几星期就可以比较圆满地解决这个问题的话，那么，无疑地，在我看来，坚持要那一磅肉（语出莎士比亚名剧——译注）——如果我可以这样譬喻的话——就是一种非常呆板的、死扣条文的和颇为小气的解释”。
    尼赫鲁接着说：“由于为时三十天的第二个时期现在已经开始，或者将从明天（十二月二十四日）开始，其他困难发生了。在这个时期中，政治会议必须召开，并决定这些问题。但是政治会议还不存在。它还没有组成，更不用说召开了。谁也不能肯定知道它会不会形成。我仍然希望而且有些料想政治会议终会形成。但是现在它并不存在。
    那么，由什么人去考虑那些没有回家的战俘的命运呢？必须由政治会议来做。政治会议还不存在。所以，很明显，作为两个司令部之间的协定的一个重要部分的某种东西还没有组成。这是协定中的一个大漏洞。怎样弥补呢？……
    如果双方成立协议，而在执行那个协议的过程中发生困难的话，那显然应当由有关的双方——在目前情况下是双方司令部——来考虑那个问题，并且更改那个协议，或者成立新的协议。”
    尼赫鲁说：“如果你说，在某日，那就是说在第一百二十天——一月二十三日左右，根据协定条款，这些战俘将恢复——不管是用什么字眼——平民身份——不管这究竟是什么意思，那么，在十二月二十三日和一月二十三日之间会一夜之间发生什么事情呢？现在有二万或二万五千人。如果我们那样决定的话，我们或许可以干脆地撤退我们的看管部队。我们是要把那些住在非军事的中立区战俘推出营房呢？还是我们把他们交给别人呢？各种非常的和困难的问题就发生了。即使不谈所牵涉的原则，这也不是一个简单的问题。”
    尼赫鲁在强调联合国在目前情况下应负的责任时说：大会应当研究这个问题并设法寻求某种解决办法，或为此提出一些建议或方案；这样做是“正确”的。
    他接着说：“这个问题曾在那里提出过，但是认为在那个时候不适宜于进行这种讨论。因此，联合国大会就休会了。联合国大会可以随时复会，当然这需要经多数会员国的同意。它们已经确定二月九日为开会的日期。但是在它们确定的某些情况下，可以使大会提前复会。有一点是极关重要的，那就是朝鲜局势不应当如一些人想像的那样自然而然地演变，这个问题不应当只是由军事指挥官来处理的问题，联合国大会应当尽可能运用它的思想和智慧来解决这个问题。”
    尼赫鲁说：据他了解，中立国遣返委员会“打算在最近就九十天的期限问题向双方司令部提出报告，指出他们所曾经遇到的困难，他们如何无法充分完成托付给他们的责任，要求双方司令部改变以前达成的协议，或达成某种协议，或就应如何处理问题表示他们的意见”。
    尼赫鲁说：“我希望甚至在目前的阶段双方司令部仍有可能就现在应怎么做法方面取得某种协议，或者是把这个期限延长一些，或者采取其他任何办法，这样我们也许可以打破这种僵局，而不必在一个月以后或更长的时间以后面临各种各样的错综困难的问题。联合国大会可能在二月九日开会，像他们预定的那样，必要时也可能提前开会。毫无疑问，在那里，或者在更早一些时候，印度政府将充分表达它对这一切问题的意见。”
