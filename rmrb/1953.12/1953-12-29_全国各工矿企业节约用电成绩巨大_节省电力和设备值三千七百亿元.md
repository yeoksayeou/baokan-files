    National Industrial and Mining Enterprises Achieve Great Success in Conserving Electricity;
    Saving Electricity and Equipment Worth 370 Billion Yuan
    National industrial and mining enterprises have achieved remarkable success in carrying out rational and economical use of electricity. According to statistics from January to September this year alone, the total value of electricity, transformers, and motors saved by industrial and mining enterprises across the country is 370 billion yuan. The saved electricity can be used for industrial production to spin 550,000 pieces of 20-count yarn; smelt 140,000 tons of steel; grind 100 million bags of flour; and is also equivalent to saving the country's basic construction investment in a 35,000 kW power plant.
    Since the Ministry of Fuel Industry held a national power supply and consumption conference at the end of last year, calling for rational use of electricity, industrial and mining enterprises in major cities across the country such as Shenyang, Anshan, Dalian, Harbin, Jinan, Tianjin, and Shanghai have launched efforts to conserve electricity. In particular, factories and mines in the Northeast region that receive high-voltage power have generally adopted measures to conserve electricity. During the discussion of the first quarter national plan, factories and mines in the Anshan area alone formulated 365 measures to conserve electricity. Shenyang Chemical Plant promoted electricity conservation, shortened the inter-electrode distance of electrolytic cells, and improved current efficiency, resulting in a 20 percent increase in production and an 8.47 percent reduction in unit power consumption. After promoting electricity conservation, Shanghai Qinfeng Paper Mill improved the Type 15 tin lining bucket, shortening the pulping time by 30 percent, saving 15,000 kWh of electricity per month.
    After the launch of electricity conservation efforts, power bureaus also actively helped users inspect power equipment, assisted industrial and mining enterprises in formulating electricity conservation plans, and organized the exchange of electricity conservation experiences. Power bureaus in Shenyang, Beijing, and other places have opened training classes for factory and mine electricians to help users' electricians further improve their theoretical and technical levels. The Dalian Power Bureau held a professional technical experience exchange conference on electricity conservation, and the Luzhong Power Bureau helped the Luzhong Paper Mill and coal mines carry out electricity conservation work. These have been generally welcomed by users. Recently, the Paper Industry Bureau of the Central Ministry of Light Industry convened a national conference of electrical professionals to summarize the experience of the paper industry system in the rational use of electricity. Many paper mills reported that close contact between power supply and consumption not only greatly saved electricity, but also guaranteed production.

    全国各工矿企业节约用电成绩巨大
    节省电力和设备值三千七百亿元
    全国各工矿企业开展合理节约用电，已获得显著成就。仅据今年一月至九月的统计，全国工矿企业节约的电量、变压器和马达的总价值为三千七百亿元。节约的电量用于工业生产可纺二十支纱五十五万件；可炼钢十四万吨；可磨一万万袋面粉；也相当为国家节省了三万五千瓩发电厂的基本建设投资。
    自从去年年底中央燃料工业部召开全国供用电会议，号召合理用电以后，全国各大城市如沈阳、鞍山、旅大、哈尔滨、济南、天津、上海等地的工矿企业，都展开了节约用电工作。特别是东北地区高压受电的厂矿，普遍采取了节约用电的措施。仅鞍山地区各厂矿在讨论第一季度国家计划时，就订出了节约电力的措施三百六十五项。沈阳化工厂推行节约用电，缩短电解槽极间距离，提高了电流效率，使产量提高了百分之二十，单位电耗降低了百分之八点四七。上海勤丰造纸厂推行节约用电后，改进了一五式锡令桶，打浆时间缩短了百分之三十，每月节约电力一万五千度。
    在节约用电工作开展后，各电业局也积极帮助用户检查用电设备，协助各工矿企业制订节约电力计划，并组织交流节约电力的经验。沈阳、北京等地电业局开办了厂、矿电工训练班，帮助用户电工进一步提高理论与技术水平。旅大电业局召开专业节约电力技术经验交流会议，鲁中电业局帮助鲁中纸厂和煤矿，开展了节约用电工作。这些都受到用户的普遍欢迎。最近中央轻工业部造纸工业局，为了总结纸业系统合理用电的经验，召开了全国性的电气专业人员会议。许多纸厂反映供用电互相密切联系，不仅大大节约了电力，而且保证了生产。
