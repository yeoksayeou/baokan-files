    The CCP Central Committee North China Bureau Holds Third Industrial Report Meeting to Promote Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement and Deploy Next Year's Production

    In order to promote the sustained development of the increase production and practice economy competition, and to prepare for next year's production, the CCP Central Committee North China Bureau held its third industrial report meeting from December 7th to 12th.

    The reports from various provinces and cities vividly showed that the three-month increase production and practice economy competition has provided a strong guarantee for striving to overfulfill the state plan. The completion of state plans by various factories and mines is increasing month by month. By the end of November, 205 state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines in the entire region had completed their annual state plans or increase production and practice economy plans ahead of schedule. Among them, Beijing Municipality has 50 units, including Shijingshan Power Plant, No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, North China Agricultural Machinery General Plant, and People's Printing Plant; Tianjin Municipality has 52 units, including Bicycle Factory, Power Machine Factory, and No. 3 Machine Factory; Hebei Province has 65 units, including Tangshan Steel Plant, Xiahuayuan Mining Bureau, and Zhangjiakou Flour Mill; Shanxi Province has 29 units, including Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant, Taiyuan Cement Plant, and Luan Coal Mine; and Suiyuan Province has 9 units, including Guancun Mica Factory and Baotou Leather Factory. Although the targets of the state plan for November were generally raised compared to October, the completion of the plan was better than in October, with state-owned factories and mines completing 106% of the output value plan and local state-owned factories and mines completing 121.9% of the output value plan. With the efforts in December, except for individual units with special reasons (unresolved production and sales issues or technical issues), most have the conditions to complete or overfulfill the state plan. Some advanced units that have already completed the state plan have also added plans to increase production and hand over profits.

    After generally analyzing the development of the increase production and practice economy competition over the past three months, the meeting believed that most factories and mines could combine the competition with improving management and improving technology, resulting in a new situation: the increase in labor productivity is not based on temporary rushes and increased labor intensity, but on effectively solving key problems, improving operating techniques, implementing Soviet expert suggestions, and further establishing sound management systems. The inter-factory competition organized by Hebei Province in the same industries such as machinery, cotton spinning, coal, and flour has yielded results in exchanging advanced technology and management experience and in continuously promoting each other to complete state plans. The 37 participating units have been able to maintain full political enthusiasm, learn from others, and improve themselves, thus achieving varying degrees of progress. Trade union organizations in Tianjin Municipality have widely promoted the experience of production meetings in the competition. For example, among 158 groups in the municipal system, 151 groups have established a group production meeting system. Through production meetings, specific issues such as mutual cooperation between different types of work, reducing defective products, and promoting advanced experience under leadership have been resolved. Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant focused on solving the problem of fully implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts in the competition. The plant's administration and trade union signed a collective contract to implement the suggestions of Soviet experts. The plant's employees not only ensured safe power supply in the competition, overfulfilled the power generation and sales plan, but also made a big step forward in technical management. The situation of reduced quality and increased defective products that occurred in the past competition rarely appeared in this year's competition. The situation of accidents and casualties is still serious in the entire region, but it has also decreased since the competition compared to the past. The meeting required all regions to continue to strengthen the leadership of the increase production and practice economy competition on the existing basis, rely on the situation of different types and different management levels of enterprises, closely combine with the improvement of production technology, and continuously enrich the content of the competition. The in-depth development of the publicity and education of the general line will become a driving force for promoting the competition to occur regularly. Therefore, all regions must firmly grasp this link, so that the competition can be carried out continuously, and the level of enterprise management can be further improved.

    The meeting also focused on discussing how to prepare for next year's production. The meeting pointed out that the Party committees of all provinces, cities, and factories and mines should first clearly affirm that the production in the first quarter of 1954 should be guaranteed not to be lower than the actual production level reached in the fourth quarter of this year. The production in the first quarter of next year will be carried out on the basis of this year's increase production and practice economy movement. The preparations for next year's production in various factories and mines will be relatively adequate. The production in the fourth quarter of this year is rising month by month, and this rise is based on improving technology and improving management. In the first quarter of next year, some completed capital construction projects will be put into production, especially after the publicity and education of the national general line is further deepened, the enthusiasm of the workers and masses for realizing socialist industrialization will be greatly enhanced. All of these, coupled with the continued efforts of leading cadres at all levels and the broad masses of workers, the units that have completed the plan should especially prevent complacency, and the factories and mines with difficulties should be given specific assistance and make overall arrangements as soon as possible, and take effective measures. Then, the production level in the first quarter of next year will at least not be lower than the level in the fourth quarter of this year, which is conditional. To this end, the production plan must be issued in advance. Some units that issue it later should first make a plan based on the plan for the fourth quarter of this year, so that the workers and masses have sufficient ideological preparation. Secondly, various production preparations for next year must be done this year, such as preparing a certain number of spare parts in the machinery industry and preparing sufficient mining faces in coal mines. Various technical organization measures to ensure the completion of the production plan must also be carefully prepared. Again, combined with the summary and commendation work, combined with the education of the general line, in-depth ideological mobilization should be carried out among the workers. The Party, trade union, and the Communist Youth League in various factories and mines should use certain strength to ensure the normal attendance rate.

    After analyzing the situation of various types of factories and mines improving enterprise management this year, the meeting believed that the main task of improving enterprise management next year should be to consolidate existing achievements and strive for further improvement. For example, the implementation of operation plans in the machinery and coal mining industries, the implementation of technical regulations education in the power industry, and the establishment of regional responsibility systems in the heavy industry have made great achievements this year, but a series of arduous work must be continued to consolidate it and drive the overall management of the entire factory to play a role in guiding future production. At present, the level of enterprise management is still very unbalanced in various factories and mines. Therefore, the Party committees of all regions must continue to implement the method of classified guidance, analyze the situation realistically, and conscientiously study the instructions of various ministries of the central government to their subordinate factories and mines to make specific improvement plans. It is impossible to leave the existing conditions, catch the wave, and establish an advanced enterprise management system in one step; it is also wrong to be blindly satisfied with existing achievements and several established systems without considering how to promote the gradual improvement of the overall management level.

    The meeting believed that with the gradual improvement of the level of enterprise management, the work of the Party committee, trade union, and the Communist Youth League in the factories and mines will not be reduced in the future but will be increasingly heavy. In order to ensure the completion of the state plan, the Party must lead and organize the strength of the trade union and the Communist Youth League to fully promote the increase production and practice economy competition, and make it regular, so that it can continuously improve in promoting the improvement of enterprises. The production meeting is a good form of using the strength of the masses to supervise and ensure the completion of the production plan. This is the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. Some factories and mines have achieved success in trial implementation and should be well promoted. The Party must support the trade union, start with doing a good job in the group production meeting, and gradually improve to establish the production meeting of the work section, workshop or the entire factory. With the expansion of production and the continuous increase of new worker components, the urgency of improving business technology is becoming increasingly important. The Party must call on, promote, and organize all aspects of strength to set off an upsurge in learning business and learning technology. With the comprehensive improvement of production, many complex political and ideological work issues closely related to production will be constantly raised to the Party committee. Therefore, the Party committees of all regions must recognize their important responsibilities, and strive to study in the work of 1954, so that political and ideological work can better serve production and meet the needs of the country during the construction period.

    中共中央华北局召开第三次工业汇报会议
    推动增产节约运动部署明年生产
    为推动增产节约竞赛持续地展开，并做好明年生产的准备工作，中共中央华北局在十二月七日到十二日，召开了第三次工业汇报会议。
    这次各省、市的汇报生动地显示出，连续三个月的增产节约竞赛已为争取超额完成国家计划提供了有力的保证。各厂矿完成国家计划的情况在逐月上涨着。全区国营、地方国营厂矿到十一月底已有二百零五个单位提前完成了全年国家计划或增产节约计划。其中，北京市有石景山发电厂、第一机床厂、华北农业机械总厂、人民印刷厂等五十个单位；天津市有自行车厂、动力机器厂、第三机器厂等五十二个单位；河北省有唐山钢厂、下花园矿务局、张家口面粉厂等六十五个单位；山西省有太原矿山机器厂、太原水泥厂、潞安煤矿等二十九个单位；绥远省有官村云母厂、包头皮革厂等九个单位。十一月份国家计划的指标虽然比十月份普遍提高了，但完成计划的情况却比十月份更好，计国营厂矿完成产值计划百分之一百零六，地方国营厂矿完成产值计划百分之一百二十一点九。再经过十二月份的努力，除有特殊原因（产销问题或技术问题未解决）的个别单位外，一般都有条件完成或超额完成国家计划。某些已经完成国家计划的先进单位，并纷纷追加增产计划和上缴利润的计划。
    会议在概括地分析了三个月来增产节约竞赛发展的情况以后，认为多数厂矿都能使竞赛和改进管理、提高技术相结合，因而普遍出现一种新的情况：即劳动生产率的提高不是建立在一时的突击和增强劳动强度的基础之上，而是建立在切实解决关键问题、改进操作技术、实现苏联专家建议、进一步建立良好的管理制度等的基础之上。河北省所组织的机器、棉纺、煤、面粉等四类同行业的厂际竞赛，在交流先进的技术和管理经验上，在不断相互推动完成国家计划上，都有了收获。参加竞赛的三十七个单位能够始终保持饱满的政治热情，学习别人，提高自己，因而取得了不同程度的进步。天津市的工会组织在竞赛中普遍推广了生产会议的经验，如市政系统一百五十八个小组中，就有一百五十一个小组建立了小组生产会议制度。通过生产会议，各个不同工种之间的相互配合、减少废品次品、有领导地推广先进经验等具体问题，得到了解决。北京石景山发电厂在竞赛中着重解决了全面贯彻苏联专家建议的问题，厂的行政与工会为贯彻苏联专家建议订立集体合同，全厂职工不但在竞赛中保证了安全供电，超额完成了发电和售电计划，而且技术管理水平向前迈进了一大步。过去竞赛中发生质量降低、次品增多的情况，在今年的竞赛中很少出现。事故伤亡情况就全区来说还是严重的，但自竞赛以来也比过去有所减少。会议要求各地在现有基础上，继续加强对增产节约竞赛的领导，依靠不同类型和不同管理水平的企业情况，紧密结合生产技术的改进，不断充实竞赛的内容。总路线的宣传教育的深入展开，将成为推动竞赛的经常发生作用的动力，因而各地要紧紧掌握这一环节，使竞赛能持续地展开，并使企业的管理的水平再提高一步。
    会议同时着重讨论了关于如何做好明年生产准备工作的问题。会议指出，各省市和各厂矿的党委首先应该明确肯定，一九五四年第一季度的生产要保证不低于今年第四季度实际达到的生产水平。明年第一季度的生产将是在今年增产节约运动的基础上进行的，各厂矿明年生产的准备工作将进行得比较充分，今年第四季度的生产是逐月上升的，而且这种上升是建立在提高技术、改进管理的基础之上的，明年第一季度将有一部分已经完工的基本建设工程投入生产，特别是国家总路线的宣传教育进一步深入后，职工群众为实现社会主义工业化的积极性将大大提高。所有这些，加上各级领导干部和广大职工继续努力，已经完成计划的单位特别防止自满情绪的产生，有困难的厂矿则加以具体的帮助，及早做出通盘的安排，采取有效措施，那末，明年第一季度生产水平至少不低于今年第四季度水平，是有条件的。为此，首先要把生产计划提前下达。某些下达较晚的单位，要依据今年第四季度的计划先做出计划，使职工群众有充分的思想准备。其次，明年各项生产准备工作必须要在今年作好，如机器业中准备一定数量的备件，煤矿中准备足够的回采工作面等。为保证生产计划完成的各种技术组织措施，也都要做周密的准备。再次，结合总结评奖工作，结合总路线的教育，要在职工中进行深入的思想动员，各厂矿党、工会、青年团要用一定的力量保证出勤率的正常。
    会议在分析了今年各种不同类型的厂矿改进企业管理工作的情形后，认为明年改进企业管理工作的主要任务，应以巩固现有成绩并争取进一步提高为主。如机器、煤矿工业中的推行作业计划，电力工业中的贯彻技术规程教育，重工业中的建立区域负责制等，今年虽然有了很大成绩，但还必须继续进行一系列的艰苦工作，使它巩固下来，并能带动全厂的全盘管理工作，使之在指导今后的生产中发挥作用。目前企业管理水平在各厂矿表现还很不平衡，因而各地党委必须继续贯彻分类指导的方法，实事求是地分析情况，认真负责地研究中央各部对所属厂矿的指示，做出具体的改进计划。离开现有条件，赶浪头，想一步就建立起先进的企业管理制度，是不可能的；盲目满足于已有成绩和已订立的几种制度，而不考虑如何推动全盘管理水平的逐步提高，也是不对的。
    会议认为，随着企业管理水平的逐步提高，厂矿中的党委、工会、青年团的工作在今后不是减轻而是日渐加重了。为了保证完成国家计划，党必须领导组织工会、青年团的力量，把增产节约竞赛全盘推动起来，并使它经常化，使它在推动企业的改进上不断有新的提高。生产会议是运用群众力量监督和保证生产计划完成的一种很好的形式。这是苏联的先进经验，有些厂矿在试行中已取得成效，应该很好地加以推广。党必须支持工会，先从搞好小组生产会议入手，逐步提高到建立工段、车间或全厂的生产会议。随着生产的扩大，新的工人成分不断增加，提高业务技术的迫切性是越来越显得重要了。党必须号召、推动、组织各方面的力量，掀起一个学习业务、学习技术的热潮。随着生产的全面改进，许多与生产紧相结合的复杂的政治工作思想工作问题，将不断地提到党委的面前。因而各地党委要认识自己的责任重大，要在一九五四年的工作中努力学习，使政治思想工作更能服务于生产，适应国家在建设时期的需要。（新华社）
