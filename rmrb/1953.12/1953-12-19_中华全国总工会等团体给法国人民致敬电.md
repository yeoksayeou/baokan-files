To the General Confederation of Labour of France, and forwarded to the National Peace Council of France, the French Republican Youth League, the French Women's Union, and the cultural circles:

    On the occasion of the 7th anniversary of the Vietnamese people's war of resistance, we, the entire Chinese people, express our warm sympathy and support for the Vietnamese people. At the same time, we express our respect to the French people who are fighting heroically for the end of the Vietnam War.

    The French colonialists, violating the peaceful will of their own people, infringed upon the national independence and freedom of the Vietnamese people and perfidiously launched a dirty war of aggression against Vietnam, an unjust war of aggression against Vietnam waged for the benefit of a small number of French rulers and the interests of American monopoly capitalists, which not only harmed the interests of the Vietnamese people but also plunged the French people into a painful situation.

    Over the past seven years, the French people have achieved many successes in their heroic struggle to end the Vietnam War. Today, after the conclusion of the Korean Armistice Agreement, when the forces demanding the relaxation of international tensions throughout the world are unprecedentedly strong, and after President Ho Chi Minh of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on the peaceful settlement of the Vietnam issue, the struggle of all strata of the French people demanding that the French government conduct peaceful negotiations with the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which truly represents the Vietnamese people, as soon as possible to end the Vietnam War is of greater significance for safeguarding world peace.

    Chinese people's organizations pay tribute to you—Vietnamese friends in France, righteous sons and daughters of France!

    中华全国总工会等团体给法国人民致敬电法国总工会并转法国全国和平理事会、法兰西共和青年联盟、法兰西妇女联盟及文化界：
    值此越南人民抗战七周年纪念日之际，我们中国全体人民一致表示对越南人民的热烈同情与支援。同时向你们为争取结束越南战争而英勇奋斗的法国人民表示敬意。
    法国殖民者违背着本国人民的和平意志，侵犯了越南人民的民族独立与自由，背信弃义地发动了侵略越南的肮脏战争，为法国一小撮统治者的利益与美国垄断资本家的利益而进行的非正义的侵略越南的战争，不但侵害了越南人民的利益，而且陷法国人民于痛苦的境域。
    七年来，法国人民在争取结束越南战争的英勇的斗争中获得了许多成就。今天在朝鲜停战协定缔结之后全世界要求缓和国际紧张局势的力量空前壮大的时候，在越南民主共和国政府胡志明主席发表关于和平解决越南问题的谈话之后，法国人民各阶层要求法国政府与真正代表越南人民的越南民主共和国政府尽速进行和平谈判、结束越南战争的斗争，对保卫世界和平更具有重大的意义。
    中国各人民团体向你们——在法国的越南朋友、法兰西正义的儿女们致敬！
