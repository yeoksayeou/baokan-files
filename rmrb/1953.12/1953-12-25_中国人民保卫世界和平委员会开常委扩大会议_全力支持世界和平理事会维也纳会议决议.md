Xinhua News Agency, December 24th: The Standing Committee of the China Peace Committee held an expanded meeting on the 23rd, at which Mao Dun, head of the Chinese delegation to the World Peace Council Vienna Conference, gave a report.

Those present at the meeting included Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman, and members of the Standing Committee in Beijing: Situ Meitang, Li Siguang, Shao Lizi, Zhang Xiruo, Xu Deheng, Xu Baoju, Peng Zemin, Liu Ningyi, Xiao San, Luo Longji; Chinese council members who attended the World Peace Council Vienna Conference: Cai Tingkai, Liu Guanyi; and specially invited representatives: Jiang Guangnai, Zheng Zhenduo, Guo Zechen, Zhu Shilun, Tang Mingzhao; heads of various departments of the China Peace Committee, representatives from the North China General Branch and Beijing Branch of the China Peace Committee, as well as representatives from organizations such as the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the All-China Democratic Youth Federation, the All-China Students' Federation, and many figures from the scientific, literary, art, and business communities.

The meeting was presided over by Guo Moruo.

In his report, Mao Dun said: In the five months since the World Peace Council Budapest meeting, the forces for peace have greatly developed. The task of this Vienna conference was to exchange views and methods based on the development of peace movements in various countries, to launch broader and deeper activities in the future, to defeat the peace enemies' continuous "Cold War" conspiracy to deceive the people, and to strive for further relaxation of international tensions.

Mao Dun pointed out: Because the idea of consultation is widely supported by the people of the world, the US government and its European partners are constantly deceiving the people with false statements pretending to be willing to ease international tensions. Mao Dun said: How can the principle of resolving international disputes through consultation, which is recognized by the people of the world, be truly implemented in action without being used by Washington as a tool to deceive and paralyze the people? This is the unanimous understanding and demand of all the representatives attending the Vienna Conference.

Mao Dun said: To discuss all the issues that are actually interconnected under a general principle (to solve them through consultation), and to focus action on a general goal that every kind man and woman can understand and accept—easing international tensions—while calling on all peace fighters to work hard to expose the deceptive propaganda of the enemies of peace, and to persuade many deceived kind men and women and win them over: this is one of the characteristics of the Vienna Conference. Another feature of this conference is the upsurge of anti-American policy sentiments. All the representatives who spoke at the conference strongly expressed this sentiment when mentioning various international disputes, especially the US military bases spread all over the world. The third feature is that this conference put forward clear and firm proposals on major international disputes that the people of the world are most concerned about, such as the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, the ceasefire in Vietnam, and the rearmament of Germany. The general resolution of the conference implements this spirit.

Mao Dun concluded: The Vienna Conference has broad representation, and therefore it correctly reflects the will of the people of the world. Therefore, the resolutions of the Vienna Conference are just, reasonable, and in line with the interests of the people. We, the Chinese people, warmly support the general resolution and declaration passed by this conference.

Those present at the meeting unanimously expressed their agreement with Mao Dun's report.

Subsequently, Liu Guanyi, Secretary-General of the China Peace Committee, read out the "General Resolution on Calling on the People of All Countries to Strengthen the Struggle for World Peace," "Letter to Organizations and Individuals Hoping to Ease International Tensions," and "Resolution on Promoting Cultural Relations Between the People of All Countries" adopted by the World Peace Council Vienna Conference. All participants unanimously supported these resolutions, and they expressed that the Chinese people will make unremitting efforts to implement these resolutions.

    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会开常委扩大会议
    全力支持世界和平理事会维也纳会议决议
    【新华社二十四日讯】中国人民保卫世界和平委员会常务委员会于二十三日举行扩大会议，由出席此次世界和平理事会维也纳会议的中国代表团团长茅盾作报告。
    出席会议的有中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若、副主席陈叔通，常务委员会在京委员司徒美堂、李四光、邵力子、张奚若、许德珩、许宝驹、彭泽民、刘宁一、萧三、罗隆基，出席世界和平理事会维也纳会议的中国理事蔡廷锴、刘贯一和特邀代表蒋光鼐、郑振铎、郭则沉、朱世纶、唐明照，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会各部门负责人和中国人民保卫世界和平委员会华北总分会、北京市分会以及中华全国总工会、中华全国民主妇女联合会、中华全国民主青年联合会、中华全国学生联合会等团体的代表们，及科学家和文艺界、工商界人士多人。
    会议由郭沫若主持。
    茅盾在报告中说：世界和平理事会布达佩斯会议以后，五个月来，和平力量有了很大发展。这一次维也纳会议的任务就是：根据各国和平运动发展的情况，交换意见和办法，展开今后的更广泛更深入的活动，击败和平敌人的持续“冷战”欺骗人民的阴谋，争取国际紧张局势的进一步缓和。
    茅盾指出：由于协商的思想被世界人民广泛拥护，美国政府和它的欧洲伙伴不断以装作愿意缓和国际紧张局势的虚伪的声明来欺骗人民。茅盾说：以协商精神解决国际争端这一为世界人民所公认的原则，如何能真正贯彻在行动中而不被华盛顿用作欺骗、麻痹人民的工具，这是出席维也纳会议全体代表一致的认识和要求。
    茅盾说：把所有的实际上是互相关联着的问题，放在一个总原则（以协商方式来解决）下来讨论，而把行动集中于每个善良的男女都能明了，都能接受的一个总目标——缓和国际紧张局势，同时号召所有和平战士要为暴露和平敌人的欺骗性的宣传而努力，要说服许多受了蒙蔽的善良的男女而把他们争取过来：这就是维也纳会议的特点之一。本届会议的又一特点是反对美国政策的情绪的昂扬，所有在会议上发言的代表们在提到各项国际争端时，特别是提到布满于全世界的美国军事基地时，都强烈地表示了这种情绪。第三个特点是本届会议对于世界人民所最关怀的国际重大争端，如朝鲜和平解决、越南停战和德国重新武装等问题，提出了明确坚决的主张。会议的总决议就是贯彻着这样的精神的。
    茅盾最后说：维也纳会议的代表性是广泛的，因而它是正确地反映了世界人民的意志的。维也纳会议的决议因而也就是公正合理的和符合于人民利益的。我们中国人民热烈拥护此次会议通过的总决议和宣言。
    出席会议的人们一致表示同意茅盾的报告。
    接着，中国人民保卫世界和平委员会秘书长刘贯一宣读了世界和平理事会维也纳会议通过的
  “关于号召各国人民加强为世界和平而斗争的总决议”、“告希望缓和国际紧张局势的各组织和个人书”和“关于促进各国人民之间的文化关系的决议”。全体与会者一致拥护这些决议，他们表示：中国人民将为贯彻这些决议而作不懈的努力。
