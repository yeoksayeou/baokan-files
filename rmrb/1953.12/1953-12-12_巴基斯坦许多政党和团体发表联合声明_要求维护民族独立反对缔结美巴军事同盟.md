Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, 9th: Pakistani public opinion is exceptionally uneasy about the US-Pakistan military negotiations and resolutely opposes turning Pakistan into a military base for American aggressors. The Jinnah Awami Muslim League, Free Pakistan Party, Sindh Provincial Trade Union Committee, All Pakistan Peace Committee, Sindh Provincial Peasants Committee, and Pakistan Bank Employees Union published a joint statement in the newspapers. The statement said: We express our concern and unease due to reports and commentaries in foreign newspapers. Foreign newspapers say that Pakistan will form some kind of "defense alliance" with the United States or with Turkey, which has already been tied to the North Atlantic bloc. This would mean allowing foreign rule over our internal affairs, and providing all our manpower and material resources to foreigners who will bring war to our country. Our young country needs peace to realize national development plans, so that the people can be free from hunger, poverty and ignorance. Any similar measures would not only gradually lose our sovereignty, but would also help maintain and consolidate foreign rule over all countries struggling for their national independence. Based on the above, we demand that the government clearly state that it will not participate in any military alliance, nor assume any obligations in this regard, that it will pursue a neutral policy, and at the same time use its influence to ease international tensions and assist other Islamic countries in their struggle for freedom and independence.

The Free Pakistan Party, in a statement issued to the press, sharply criticized Pakistani government officials for secretly plotting a military alliance with the United States behind the backs of the people. The statement said that their forced "explanations and clarifications" are completely inconsistent with the actual situation. The Free Pakistan Party believes that it is completely understandable that neighboring countries have expressed unease about the news of the proposed US-Pakistan military alliance. The statement continued to point out that no country in the Middle East and Asia can calmly watch the development of these events. Asian countries are extremely uneasy about the United States establishing military bases in the Asian region and encircling those countries that are friendly to them. The Free Pakistan Party's statement pointed out that the Pakistani people oppose all military alliances. The party demanded that the government immediately clarify its policy on the following issues: 1. Is Pakistan's foreign policy based on the principles of maintaining peace and preventing a new world war? 2. Does the government's policy include: establishing peaceful and friendly relations with all neighboring countries regardless of ideological differences? 3. What steps has the government taken to strengthen the struggle of the people of the Middle East for self-determination and to break free from enslavement? 4. Is Pakistan going to conclude a military alliance with the United States or do something similar, regardless of the position of most Asian-Arab countries? 5. Is the Pakistani government aware that most Asian-Arab countries oppose US-Pakistan negotiations on the conclusion of a military alliance? 6. Has the Pakistani government ignored the reaction of countries around the world to this event, and is it determined to take a path that will seriously damage relations with other countries and threaten Pakistan's freedom and unity?

    巴基斯坦许多政党和团体发表联合声明
    要求维护民族独立反对缔结美巴军事同盟
    【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社喀喇蚩九日讯：巴基斯坦舆论界对美巴军事谈判感到异常不安，并坚决反对把巴基斯坦变为美国侵略者的军事基地。真纳人民回教联盟、自由巴基斯坦党、信德省工会委员会、全巴基斯坦和平委员会、信德省农民委员会和巴基斯坦银行职员联合会在报纸上发表联合声明。声明说：我们由于外国报纸的报道和评论而表示忧虑和不安。外国报纸说：巴基斯坦将和美国或是和已被捆缚在北大西洋集团中的土耳其结成某种“防御同盟”。这将意味着允许外国统治我们的内部生活，意味着把我们的一切人力和物力供给将会给我们国家带来战争的外国。我们年青的国家需要和平，以实现国家发展的计划，使得人民免于饥饿、贫乏和愚昧。任何类似的措施，不仅会使我们的主权逐渐丧失，而且还将帮助维持和巩固外国对所有在为自己的民族独立而斗争的国家的统治。根据以上所述，我们要求政府明白表示它将不参与任何军事同盟，不在这方面担负任何义务，它将执行中立政策，同时利用自己的影响以缓和国际紧张局势，以及援助其他回教国家进行争取自由和独立的斗争。
    自由巴基斯坦党在向报界发表的声明中，尖锐地斥责巴基斯坦政府官员背着人民与美国秘密策划军事同盟。声明中说，他们迫不得已的“解释和辟谣”是与实际情况毫不相符的。自由巴基斯坦党认为，邻国对拟议中的美巴军事同盟的消息表示不安，这是完全可以理解的。声明中继续指出，中东和亚洲的任何一个国家都不能泰然地看着这些事件的发展。亚洲国家对美国在亚洲地区建立军事基地并包围那些与它们友好的国家表示极大的不安。自由巴基斯坦党的声明指出，巴基斯坦人民反对一切军事同盟。该党要求政府立即就下列问题阐明其政策：一、巴基斯坦的外交政策是否基于维护和平和防止新的世界大战的原则。二、政府政策中是否包括：不论思想上的差别而与所有邻国建立和平与友好的关系。三、政府在加强中东各国人民为自决和摆脱奴役的斗争的事业中采取了怎样的步骤。四、巴基斯坦是否不顾大多数亚洲—阿拉伯国家的立场，要与美国缔结军事同盟或做出类似的事情。五、巴基斯坦政府是否知道大多数亚洲—阿拉伯国家反对美巴关于缔结军事同盟的谈判。六、巴基斯坦政府是否忽视了世界各国对这一事件的反应，是否坚决要走将会严重地破坏与其他国家的关系并使巴基斯坦的自由与统一遭到威胁的道路。
