Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, 30th: The World Peace Council passed a resolution on promoting cultural relations among peoples of all countries at its closing meeting on the 28th.

The resolution said: The World Peace Council at its last meeting correctly pointed out that the widespread development of cultural exchange is necessary and possible, and believes that this is a valuable factor in achieving and consolidating the relaxation of international tensions.

We are pleased to see that, despite the countless difficulties that still exist, great achievements have been made in this area since then. At the same time, we believe that even greater achievements will be made in the near future.

If every organization and individual who cherishes their own culture and world culture decides to establish contact and work to establish fruitful international relations on the basis of mutual exchange, then the future is unlimited.

The peace movement guarantees full support for the many activities that have been completed or are being planned, such as: visits, exchange of delegations, exchange of works of art, exchange of literary, scientific and other publications, holding international exhibitions, convening conferences, holding festivals, mutual visits by scientists, representatives of intellectual circles, artists and athletes, and so on.

We appeal to all organizations and individuals who are concerned about developing cultural relations among the peoples of all countries. We call on them to increase these activities, to cooperate more widely, and to make this work more effective.

    关于促进各国人民之间的文化关系的决议
    【新华社三十日讯】据塔斯社维也纳讯：世界和平理事会在二十八日闭幕会议上通过了关于促进各国人民之间的文化关系的决议。
    决议说：世界和平理事会上次会议曾正确地指出，广泛地发展文化交流是必须的而且是可能的，认为这是达成和巩固国际紧张局势的缓和的有价值的因素。
    我们高兴地看到，尽管仍然存在着无数困难，从那时起，已在这方面取得很大的成就。同时我们认为，在不久的将来，将取得更大的成就。
    如果每一个珍视本国文化和世界文化的组织和个人，都决定建立接触，并为在互相交换的基础上建立有成果的国际关系而工作，那末前途是无限的。
    和平运动保证充分支持许许多多已经完成的或是在计划中的活动，例如：访问，互派代表团，交换艺术作品，交换文学、科学和其他出版物，举办国际展览会，召开大会，举行联欢，科学家、知识界代表、艺术家和运动员互相访问等等。
    我们向一切关心发展各国人民之间的文化关系的组织和个人呼吁。我们号召他们增加这些活动，号召他们更加广泛地进行合作，使这种工作更加有效。
