    State-Owned Guangdong Zini Sugar Factory Completes Construction Project Ahead of Schedule
    The construction project of a new type of machine-made sugar factory in our country—the state-owned Guangdong Zini Sugar Factory—was basically completed one month ahead of schedule at the end of October. It is now intensively carrying out all preparations before production, so that it can be put into production immediately after the overall trial run is completed.
    Workers transferred from the four major sugar factories in Shunde, Dongguan, Shitou, and Jieyang have all arrived. They will become the backbone of the production team of this new sugar factory. On November 15th, production workers began to enter the beautiful, spacious, and bright workshops, taking their positions and intensively carrying out preparations before production. They carefully inspect every part and every pipe of the machine, understand and become familiar with every part of the machine, to ensure safe production in the future. Staff in the laboratory are also working hard on testing.
    The most important raw material for the factory's production—sugar cane, as well as essential materials such as oil, sacks, and sulfur ore—have been basically prepared.
    Staff of the agricultural affairs section went deep into the cane-growing areas and have organized farmers in more than 30 villages, helping them establish sugar cane delivery teams and signing sugar cane delivery contracts with them. Farmers in various villages have proposed that they must strive to increase production and deliver good sugar cane to the factory. Huang Sheng, chairman of the Guba Township Farmers Association, said: Our sugar cane is growing very well this year, and production has generally increased; we will deliver good sugar cane to the factory. Their township alone will sell more than 889,000 kilograms of sugar cane to the sugar factory. The factory's agricultural affairs section is also planning to hold a meeting of sugar cane farmers before the official start of crushing to listen to their opinions.
    In order to welcome the upcoming production tasks, workers have discussed the production targets for the crushing season from the end of 1953 to 1954, taking the workshop as a unit. Everyone unanimously expressed confidence in completing the tasks.

    国营广东紫坭糖厂提前完成建厂工程
    我国新建的一座新型的机器制糖工厂——国营广东紫坭糖厂的建厂工程已在十月底提前一个月基本完成，现正紧张地进行生产前的一切准备工作，以便在全面试机完成后，立即投入生产。
    从顺德、东莞、市头、揭阳四大糖厂调去的工人，已经全部到达。他们将成为这个新建糖厂生产队伍的骨干。十一月十五日，生产工人开始走进漂亮、宽大而光亮的车间，各就岗位，紧张地进行生产前的准备工作。他们细心检查机器的每一个零件、每一条管道，了解和熟识机器的每一个部位，以保证今后进行安全的生产。化验室里的工作人员也正紧张地做着化验工作。
    工厂里最重要的生产原料——甘蔗与油类、麻包、硫矿等必需材料，已基本上准备好了。
    农务科工作人员深入蔗区，已将三十多个乡的农民组织起来，帮助他们成立交蔗小组，并和他们签订交蔗合同。各乡的农民都提出一定要努力增产，把好蔗交给工厂。古坝乡农民协会主席黄生说：我们今年甘蔗长得很好，普遍增产；我们要把好蔗送到工厂里来。单他们一个乡，就要把八十八万九千多公斤的甘蔗卖给糖厂。该厂农务科并准备在正式开榨前召开蔗农会议，听取蔗农的意见。
    为了迎接即将到来的生产任务，工人已经以车间为单位，讨论了一九五三年底至一九五四年度的榨季生产指标。大家一致表示有信心完成任务。
