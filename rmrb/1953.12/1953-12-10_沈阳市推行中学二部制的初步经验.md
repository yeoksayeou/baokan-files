Preliminary Experience of Shenyang City in Promoting the Two-Part Middle School System
Shenyang Municipal People's Government Education Bureau, Secondary Education Section

Shenyang City began piloting the two-part system in fourteen middle schools (a total of 105 classes) from the second semester of 1951. After more than two years of practice, it has been fully proven that the two-part system can guarantee teaching quality, provided that certain conditions are met. The results of the junior high school graduates from Shenyang No. 1 Middle School and No. 10 Middle School, which implemented the two-part system, participating in the senior high school entrance examination this summer are clear proof of this. A total of 273 students from No. 1 Middle School participated in the examination, and 242 passed, accounting for approximately 89% (of which 85 students scored above 80, accounting for approximately 35% of the passing students), and only 31 failed, accounting for approximately 11%; the total average score was 72.26 points. A total of 285 students from No. 10 Middle School participated in the examination, and 255 passed, accounting for approximately 90% (of which 80 students scored above 80, accounting for approximately 31% of the passing students), and 29 failed, accounting for approximately 10%; the total average score was 71.54 points. This shows that the general view that the two-part system cannot guarantee teaching quality is unfounded.

Now, we will write down our preliminary experiences in running the two-part system for the past two years.

First, it is necessary to make all parties aware of the important significance of promoting the two-part system. At the beginning of the pilot implementation of the two-part system in Shenyang City, the Municipal Education Bureau did not fully understand the importance of the two-part system and had no experience, so it did not pay enough attention to this work and lacked leadership. The administrative and teaching staff of the schools also lacked a clear understanding of the two-part system. At that time, some teachers regarded the promotion of the two-part system as a temporary emergency measure. One director of studies said: "The two-part system is a temporary night school and cannot be run for a long time." The more common idea was that it was troublesome and that it would be best not to run it if possible, and to run it as little as possible if necessary. In addition, some people lacked confidence in running the two-part system, believing that if the two-part system were added with insufficient manpower and resources, not only would the second part not be run well, but the quality of the first part would also be affected. Although some schools accepted the task of running the two-part system, they still focused their main efforts on the first part. It seemed that the second part was an "additional" task, and it was enough to "take along" and run it, and it didn't matter if it didn't run well. In addition, running the second part was a new task with many difficulties, such as the inability to allocate time and classrooms, the poor quality of students, and the fact that the teachers in the second part were mostly newly recruited or promoted from primary school teachers. Therefore, some teachers in the first part looked down on the teachers in the second part, saying that the teachers in the second part were "nothing"; some students in the first part also looked down on the students in the second part, and even wrote allegros to satirize them. Teachers teaching in the first part did not want to be transferred to the second part, thinking that going to the second part was a demotion and a disgrace; teachers promoted from primary schools were also uneasy, thinking that they were not as impressive as they were in primary school. The students in the second part were also very unstable, unwilling to study, and many wanted to go to the factory; or study at home and prepare for the exam again next year. When parents saw this situation, they also lost confidence in the second part, thinking that the second part was "useless" and "there was no point in studying". Some parents even went to the school to ask that their children be transferred to the first part to study.

These situations affected the promotion of the two-part system. This made us feel that the cadres of the Municipal Education Bureau must first recognize the importance of the two-part system, and educate school leaders, teachers, students, and parents of students to recognize the importance of the two-part system. After the cadres of the Education Bureau corrected their thinking, attached importance to the two-part system, and strengthened their leadership over the two-part system, they conducted necessary publicity and education work for school leaders, teachers, and students and parents through the school, explaining the relationship between the promotion of the two-part system and national economic construction. Everyone was told that if manpower and resources were sufficient, it would be entirely possible not to run the two-part system; the problem is that today and for a considerable period in the future, due to the limitations of manpower (mainly teachers) and resources (mainly school buildings), it is still impossible to completely run the first part (even in the Soviet Union, some schools still have the two-part system today). Therefore, it is very necessary to run the two-part system. In terms of the current situation in Shenyang City, if all middle schools implement the two-part system, they will be able to enroll more than 75% more students into schools each year. This will not only appropriately meet the needs of the people, but also prepare reserve forces for national economic construction and universities. Therefore, running the two-part system today has special and important significance. After such publicity and education, the resistance to the promotion of the two-part system was reduced, and the two-part system was run more smoothly.

Second, schools that promote the two-part system should appropriately adjust their organizational structure. With the promotion of the two-part system, the number of students and classes has increased compared to before, and there are many new problems in teaching. The school's organizational structure should be appropriately adjusted, and the number of leading cadres should be appropriately increased. If the original structure and old working methods are still used, it will inevitably cause chaos in the school. When Shenyang City began to implement the two-part system, the principals and directors of studies of some schools did not have new divisions of labor, and several leaders grasped both the first and second parts, resulting in them arriving at school at five o'clock in the morning and not leaving until seven o'clock in the evening. They could not take a nap at noon, and they could not rest on Sundays. Everyone was busy and exhausted, but the work was not done well; some schools only focused on the first part and abandoned the second part, leaving the second part in a state of no leadership. According to our experience, two-part schools with many students should preferably have two directors of studies; if there is really no one, a better and more capable teacher should be selected to serve as the director of the second part, responsible for leading the teaching work of the second part. The first and second parts should cooperate closely and work under the unified leadership of the principal. The general affairs office and the teaching affairs office of the first and second parts do not need to be separated, but the number of staff can be appropriately increased according to the number of students (personnel for statistics, general affairs, etc.).

Third, solve the problem of teachers in a realistic manner. Where do teachers come from when the number of students increases sharply? At present, higher normal schools cannot meet the needs of secondary schools. In this case, our solution to the teacher problem is: running teacher training classes to train unemployed intellectuals, promoting primary school teachers, and retaining high school graduates from various schools to teach, etc. In addition, we have also absorbed some graduates from secondary normal schools. Facts have proved that these high school and secondary normal school graduates are generally progressive in politics, most of them are Youth League members, and their academic performance in school is also relatively good. They can basically handle junior high school courses. These comrades are characterized by being young, having simple thoughts, wanting to make progress, and being enthusiastic and active in their work; their shortcomings are that their knowledge scope is relatively narrow and they lack teaching experience. However, as long as attention is paid to their training in their work, they will progress quickly. Based on the above situation, in the case of insufficient teachers today, in addition to recruiting and promoting primary school teachers, selecting some outstanding secondary normal school and high school graduates can still solve some problems.

Fourth, alternating classes in the morning and afternoon is a better way to solve the problem of time and classrooms. Taking the city's No. 12 Middle School as an example, before the first semester of 1952, the first part was fixed to attend classes in the morning, and the second part was fixed to attend classes in the afternoon. The disadvantage of this method is that students in the second part had to bring lamps to attend classes, which affected their eyesight. Therefore, some students in the second part said: "We are black students." No matter how the school explained it, they still felt that the treatment was unfair, had a sense of inferiority, and were not very motivated to study. From the second semester of 1952, the school adopted the method of alternating classes between the first and second parts every week in the morning and afternoon, changing the first and second parts to "Group A and Group B". Both Group A and Group B have classes of high and low grades so that students can independently participate in necessary social activities. The advantage of this method is that it eliminates the boundaries between the first and second parts and provides equal treatment, eliminating all incorrect understandings of the second part such as "black students." The disadvantage is that changing every week is frequent, and the students have just gotten used to it, and they have to change again, and sometimes some confusion occurs. Currently, all two-part schools in Shenyang City change at least once every two weeks, and at most once every four weeks.

In this regard, there is a problem that must be paid attention to: The time for the first part to leave school and the time for the second part to start class should preferably be separated by 30 to 50 minutes. Otherwise, before the first part leaves school, the students in the second part will have already arrived at school and have nowhere to stay. They have no choice but to wander the streets or crowd into nearby bookstores to read "comic books"; or, the students are all crowded in the yard, fighting and making noise, which affects the class and the order is very chaotic.

In addition, according to our experience, it is best not to run two schools in one school building, that is to say, when adding two-part classes, it should not exceed one-half of the original number of classes in the school. In this way, a few empty classrooms can be left as "mobile classrooms", and there will be no difficulty in scheduling classes, and the difficulty of students having nowhere to go in windy and rainy weather or cold weather in winter will also be solved.

Fifth, earnestly solve the problem of class tutoring and students' extracurricular self-study. One of the difficulties of the two-part system is that students stay at school for a short time, and extracurricular activities and tutoring work cannot be carried out, which brings great difficulties to the work of the class teacher. However, if the class tutoring work is not done well, there will be a phenomenon of chaotic study discipline, and students' good qualities cannot be cultivated well. The preliminary experience of the two-part middle schools in Shenyang City in this regard is: It is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the class teachers, such as strengthening the class teachers' understanding of the class tutoring work and their sense of responsibility to the motherland and the youth through the study of the "Regulations on Class Teacher Work", so as to enable them to give full play to their high enthusiasm and creativity and do the class teacher work as best as possible. The class teacher must be good at using time and space to carry out his work. It is impossible to solve any problems by waiting passively or emphasizing objective difficulties.

In order to solve the problem of students' extracurricular self-study, Shenyang City has universally organized "family study groups". The experience of running "family study groups" is: First, the grouping must be based on the principles of students' willingness and convenience of study, and consideration should be given to the distance of residence and the quality of academic performance; second, the class teacher should help formulate specific group study covenants and plans. In addition to listening to the reports of each group every week, all subject teachers should be mobilized to go to each group to tutor, supervise and help students solve difficulties in learning; third, it is necessary to attach importance to and do a good job in the work of parents, that is, to help students publicize the importance of promoting the two-part system to parents in order to obtain the support of parents; fourth, pay attention not to turn the family study group into a mutual aid group, so as not to cultivate the dependence of students with poor performance and create an excessive burden for students with good performance; finally, the school should always pay attention to the leadership of the family study group, otherwise it will form a free flow state and even collapse.

    沈阳市推行中学二部制的初步经验
    沈阳市人民政府教育局中等教育科
    沈阳市从一九五一年下学期起开始在全市十四个中学（共一○五班）试办二部制。经过二年多来的实践，已经充分证明，只要具备一定的条件，二部制是可以保证教学质量的。今年暑期，实行二部制的沈阳市第一中学和第十中学两校初中毕业生参加高中升学考试的成绩就是明证。第一中学参加考试的学生共二百七十三人，及格的有二百四十二人，约占百分之八十九（其中考试成绩在八十分以上的有八十五人，约占及格人数的百分之三十五），不及格的只有三十一人，约占百分之十一；总平均分数是七十二点二六分。第十中学参加考试的学生共二百八十五人，考试成绩及格的有二百五十五人，约占百分之九十（其中考试成绩在八十分以上的有八十人，约占及格人数的百分之三十一），不及格的二十九人，约占百分之十；总平均分数是七十一点五四分。这就说明，笼统地认为二部制不能保证教学质量的看法，是没有根据的。
    现在把我们两年来办二部制的初步经验，写在下面。
    第一、要使各方面都认识推行二部制的重要意义。沈阳市试办二部制之初，市教育局不大了解二部制的重要性，也没有什么经验，所以对这项工作重视不够，领导不力。各校的行政和教学人员对二部制的认识也不明确。当时有些教师把推行二部制看成临时性的救急措施。有一个教导主任说：“二部制是临时夜中学，不能长期办下去。”较为普遍的思想是嫌麻烦，主张能不办最好不办，要办也尽量少办。另外，有些人对办二部缺乏信心，认为：在人力和物力不足的情况下，如果增设二部，不但二部办不好，一部的质量也会受到影响。有的学校虽然接受了办二部制的任务，但仍然把主要的力量放在一部。好像二部是“附加”的任务，“捎带”着办一办也就可以了，即或办不好也没啥。再加上办二部是新的工作，困难重重，如时间和教室支配不开，学生质量较差，二部的教师也多半是新招聘或由小学教师提升的，因而一部的某些教师看不起二部的教师，说二部的教师“啥也不是”；一部的某些学生也看不起二部的学生，甚至编了快板，加以讽刺。教一部的教师，谁也不愿调到二部，认为到二部是降级，是耻辱；从小学提升的教师，情绪也不安，认为没有在小学神气。二部的学生，思想也很波动，不愿学习，很多人想到工厂去；或者在家补习，准备来年再考。学生家长看到这些情形，对二部也失掉了信心。认为二部是“白搭”，“念不念没啥劲”。有些家长还到校要求把他们的子女转入一部学习。
    这些情况，影响了二部制的推行。这使我们感到，市教育局的干部必须首先认识二部制的重要性，并教育学校领导人员、教师、学生、学生家长都认识二部制的重要性。在教育局的干部端正了思想，重视了二部制，加强了对二部制的领导之后，向学校领导人员、教师，并由学校向学生和学生家长，进行了必要的宣传教育工作，说明推行二部制和国家经济建设的关系。告诉大家，如果人力和物力充足，完全可以不办二部；问题在于今天以至今后相当长的时期内，因为人力（主要是教师）、物力（主要是校舍）的限制，还不可能完全办一部（就是在苏联，今天还有一些学校仍然有二部制），因此，办二部制是十分必要的。以沈阳市现在的情况来说，如果中学全部实行了二部制，每年就能够多吸收百分之七十五以上的学生进入学校学习，这不但能够适当地满足人民的要求，同时也能够为国家经济建设及高等学校准备后备力量。所以今天办二部制是有着特殊重要意义的。经过这样的宣传教育，减少了推行二部制的阻力，二部制就比较顺利地办起来了。
    第二、推行二部制的学校，要适当地调整组织机构。推行二部制，学生和班次比以前增加了，教学中有许多新的问题，学校的组织机构自应作适当的调整，领导干部应有适当的增加，如果仍按原来的机构，老一套的工作方法，一定会造成学校中的混乱。沈阳市在开始实行二部制的时候，有些学校的校长、教导主任没有新的分工，几个领导人员一、二部一齐抓，结果早晨五点钟到校，晚七点钟才走，午觉也不能睡，星期日也得不到休息，大家忙忙乱乱，疲惫不堪，工作却没有做好；有的学校只抓一部，放弃了二部，二部陷于无人领导的状态。据我们的体会，学生多的二部制学校，最好能设两个教导主任；如实在无人，也要挑选一个较好的、能力强的教师来担任二部的主任，专责领导二部的教学工作。一、二部之间要紧密配合，在校长统一领导下进行工作。一、二部的总务处和教导处则不必分开，可根据学生人数适当地增加职员人数
  （统计、总务等人员）。
    第三、实事求是地解决师资问题。学生骤增，教师从那里来呢？在目前，高等师范学校还不能满足中等学校的需要。在这种情况下，我们解决教师问题的办法是：举办师资训练班训练失业知识分子，提升小学教师，各校高中毕业生留校任教等。此外，我们还吸收了一部分中等师范毕业学生。事实证明：这些高中和中等师范毕业生，在政治上一般都是进步的，大多数是青年团员，他们在校时候的学习成绩也都是较好的，他们担任初中课程基本上是可以的。这些同志的特点是年轻，思想单纯，要求进步，工作积极热情；缺点是知识范围比较狭窄，缺乏教学经验。但是，只要在工作中注意培养，他们的进步是很快的。根据上述情况来看，在今天师资不足的情况下，除招聘和提升小学教师外，挑选一部分优秀的中等师范和高中毕业学生还是可以解决一些问题的。
    第四、上下午轮换上课是解决时间问题和教室问题的较好办法。以本市第十二中学为例，该校在一九五二年上学期以前是一部固定在上午上课，二部固定在下午上课，这种办法的缺点是二部学生要带灯上课，影响视力。于是，二部有的学生说：“我们是黑学生”，无论学校怎样解释，他们仍认为待遇不均，有自卑感，学习劲头不大。该校从一九五二年下期起采取了一、二部按上下午每周轮换上课的办法，改一、二部为“甲乙组”。甲乙组都编有高低年级的班次，以便学生独立参加必要的社会活动。这种办法的好处是：消灭了一、二部的界限，待遇均等。消除了“黑学生”等等一切对二部的不正确认识。缺点是：每周轮流一次，调动频繁，学生刚刚习惯了，又要调动，有时也要发生一些紊乱情形。现在沈阳市所有二部制学校最少的是两周轮换一次，多则四周轮换一次。
    这方面，有个问题须要注意：一部放学的时间，和二部上课的时间，最好要相隔三十分钟到五十分钟，不然，不等一部放学，二部学生早已到校，无处可呆，只好溜大街或挤在附近的书店里去看“小人书”；或者，学生都挤在院内打闹、吵嚷，影响上课，秩序很乱。
    此外，根据我们的经验，最好不要以一个校舍办两个学校，也就是说，在增设二部制班级时，最多也不超过本校原班数的二分之一。这样，能留几个空教室作为“机动教室”，排课不致发生困难，也解决了风雨的天气或冬季天冷时，学生没处去的困难。
    第五、认真解决班级辅导和学生的课外自习问题。二部制的困难之一是学生留校时间短，课外活动和辅导工作没法开展，这就给班主任工作带来了很大的困难。但如果班级辅导工作作不好，定会产生学习纪律混乱的现象，不能好好培养学生的优良品质。沈阳市二部制中学在这方面的初步经验是：必须加强对班主任的领导，如通过对“班主任工作条例”的学习，加强班主任对班级辅导工作的认识，及对祖国对青年的责任感，从而使他们发挥高度的积极性和创造性，尽一切可能做好班主任工作。班主任必须善于利用时间和空间进行自己的工作，消极等待或强调客观困难，是不能解决任何问题的。
    为了解决学生课外的自习问题，沈阳市普遍组织了“家庭学习小组”。搞“家庭学习小组”的经验是：首先，编组必须以学生自愿及学习方便为原则，并应照顾到住址远近及学习成绩的好坏；其次，班主任应帮助制订具体的小组学习公约及计划，除每周听取各组汇报外，并应发动全体科任教师分别到各小组去辅导，督促和帮助学生解决学习中的困难问题；第三，必须重视和做好家长工作，即帮助学生向家长宣传推行二部制的重要性，以取得家长的支持；第四，注意不要把家庭学习小组弄成互助组，以免养成功课差的学生的依赖性，造成功课好的学生的过重负担；最后，学校要经常注意对家庭学习小组的领导，不然会形成自流状态以至于垮台。
