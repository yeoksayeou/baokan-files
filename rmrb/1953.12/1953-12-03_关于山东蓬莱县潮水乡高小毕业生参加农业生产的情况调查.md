Investigation on the Participation of Senior Elementary School Graduates in Chaoshui Township, Penglai County, Shandong Province in Agricultural Production
    Tian Mu
    A Heartening Phenomenon
    The peasants of Chaoshui Township, Penglai County, Shandong Province, often speak with gratitude about the many good things the People's Government has done for them. One of these is the establishment of schools.
    This township has a complete primary school with six hundred and fifty students, accounting for 18% of the township's population. Currently, there are 140 households in this township with two children in school, 40 households with three children, 8 households with four children, and 3 households with five children. All school-age children in the township are enrolled.
    With the expansion of the school, the number of senior elementary school graduates has increased year by year. In 1951, there were thirty-one senior elementary school graduates. At that time, people said: "Amazing, our ancestors never had so many students!" In 1952, there were another sixty-five graduates, and in 1953, another seventy-nine graduates. This heartening phenomenon encourages everyone. Everyone sees that the cultural landscape of the countryside is indeed changing with each passing day.
    The issue of senior elementary school graduates' further education once caused confusion in the thinking of the peasants
    With the increasing number of senior elementary school graduates year by year, the future of these graduates has become a major social issue. In the past three years, out of the 175 senior elementary school graduates in the township, twenty-six have gone on to further education, accounting for less than 15%; thirty-four have found employment elsewhere, accounting for just over 19%; and 114 are at home, accounting for just over 65%. Although the number of students going on to further education is unprecedentedly high in this township, it is still far from meeting the masses' demands for further education. One hundred percent of the 175 senior elementary school graduates want to go on to further education, and 70% of the parents planned to provide their children with secondary education. However, the current national economic strength does not allow for the establishment of so many secondary schools that all senior elementary school graduates can go on to further education. Therefore, the issue of senior elementary school graduates' further education once caused confusion in the thinking of the peasants. Before and after the secondary school enrollment, the issue of further education was being discussed everywhere. Some peasants asked cadres: "Will my child be able to get into school this year? What if they don't get in?" Upon hearing that the school had announced the results, many parents rushed to the city to inquire whether their children had been admitted and to the post office to inquire whether the school had sent a letter. Upon hearing that their children had not been admitted, they were dejected and full of complaints. The senior elementary school graduates who were not admitted were even more anxious. Whenever there were recruitment opportunities, they would definitely go. Many students ran to Yantai, and even to cities such as Dalian and Shenyang to find a way out. Later, because they couldn't find work, they returned home. Some people joined the production, while others were still unwilling to participate in production. Some students were lazy and did not work, "opening their mouths for food and reaching out for clothes," and they quarreled with their parents all day long. They generally did not participate in rural political activities, and even if they did, they considered themselves intellectuals, "criticizing and commenting" and gesticulating. The masses were very dissatisfied with this chaotic situation and were full of discussions.
    A large number of senior elementary school graduates participated in agricultural production
    The fact that senior elementary school graduates in Chaoshui Township all want to go on to further education and all try to leave the countryside is not only not allowed by the current national economic situation, but also not allowed from the perspective of developing agricultural production in this township.
    The people of the old revolutionary base area have contributed a large number of people in the decade of revolutionary war and in the current national industrial construction. At present, Chaoshui Township has a total of 270 households of revolutionary martyrs' families, military dependents, and workers' families, and nearly 1,000 peasants have gone elsewhere. Therefore, there are fewer young and middle-aged people here, and a labor shortage has begun to appear. The township has a total of 8,221 mu of land, with a total of 497 full laborers and 179 semi-laborers, with each full laborer having to bear an average of 13 mu of land.
    Due to the shortage of labor, the processing of land has been considerably restricted. The township has 1,005 mu of land cultivated on behalf of families of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, and workers, with each laborer who is not a family member of a revolutionary martyr, military dependent or worker having to cultivate 4 mu on behalf of them. Because each laborer bears too much land on behalf of others, the quality of cultivation on behalf of others is inevitably affected. At present, there are 51 households of orphans and widows without labor in the township, and they often cannot hire people during the busy farming season, so their harvest every year is not good enough. Some well fields that must and can be used to grow vegetables have to be planted with general crops due to lack of labor. Therefore, some old farmers have different views on the future of senior elementary school graduates, and they very much hope that a group of senior elementary school graduates will invest in agricultural production, and they repeatedly try to persuade students who want to go on to further education to stay. With deep affection for the land, they said to their children: "We are no longer good for heavy work, so we will rely on you to farm in the future. You must not leave the land barren and abandoned." However, some senior elementary school graduates did not listen to the elders' advice and insisted on leaving. The old farmers were afraid that resolutely preventing them would delay the students' "future" and be blamed, so they had to let them "try their luck" with a conflicted heart. Some old farmers secretly shed tears at home at night after sending their sons to take the exam, fearing that "production will be cut off in the future." When some senior elementary school graduates returned, some old farmers said: "It is the best policy for the government to ask you to participate in production. If you all go on to further education, who will produce? Will the land be left barren? Then we won't have to eat!" As for some of the more far-sighted farmers in the township, they recognize that in order to develop agricultural production, it is necessary to cultivate a large number of production activists with a considerable level of education because they have seen the future social prospects and the broad prospects of agricultural production. Therefore, they warmly welcome a group of senior elementary school graduates to invest in agricultural production.
    Thanks to the education of the Party and the People's Government, and thanks to the influence of advanced peasants and old farmers, senior elementary school graduates who did not go on to further education slowly changed their thinking that they must go on to further education, and successively responded to the call of the People's Government and invested in production.
    According to statistics, in the past three years, 60% of the 114 senior elementary school graduates at home have actively participated in agricultural production, and they have played a great role in production. Many people have become production experts. Of the forty-seven senior elementary school graduates at home in 1951 and 1952, fifteen have become recognized production experts in the village. For example, Zhang Zilin, a graduate of 1951, is only seventeen years old this year, and is now the main force of production in his family. He cultivates four mu of land and one mu of garden by himself; last year, he planted 850 Chinese cabbages, watering and pruning them himself, and the cabbages grew very well. Last year, he responded to the call of the higher authorities to apply more fertilizer, used the money he earned by "running transportation" with his own cart to build a pigsty, and bought a piglet. Now the piglet is growing very fat, and the manure is full of the pen. Everyone envies and praises him. Another example is Zhou Lianfang, a female student who graduated in 1952. When she first joined production, others looked down on her and said: "Girls are money-losing goods, and participating in production is just a blind alley." However, after a year of labor training, she has become a model for women's production in the village. Her father is a semi-laborer and is often ill, so all eleven mu of land in the family depend on her. Last year, she planted one mu of scallions, 250 Chinese cabbages, and also planted sorghum and corn. She does all the work of drawing water with a waterwheel, fertilizing, hoeing, and plowing the land. She also pushes a cart to the market more than thirty miles away to sell vegetables.
    In the mutual aid and cooperation movement, many senior elementary school graduates actively promoted the benefits of mutual aid groups. Some persuaded their parents to join the mutual aid groups, and some played an active role in the mutual aid groups. The Zhang Zixu mutual aid group in Village One is one of the best in the township. Among them are two members of the Communist Youth League, one named Zhang Huaying and the other named Zhang Shumei. They both graduated last year and work best in the mutual aid group and have been classified as full laborers. The yield of the land they cultivate has increased by fifty to one hundred jin per mu compared to before. They often publicize the benefits of mutual aid to the masses.
    Before these students participated in production, many old farmers worried that their production technology would not find anyone to pass it on and would "break the string." Now, senior elementary school graduates are actively learning production technology from old farmers. Most of them have learned how to use the waterwheel, dig seedlings, hoe, and fertilize, and some have learned how to soak and select seeds, and some have also learned how to plow and sow the land. For example, Zheng Jianye, a student who graduated in 1952, his father is an old farmer with rich production experience, and he used to be very worried that his technology would be cut off; now he is no longer worried, because his son is enthusiastically learning his technology.
    Before these students participated in production, some old farmers still had the idea that "production does not need culture." In the past, when new cultivation methods and improved varieties were promoted, some old farmers said: "I have been farming all my life and have never heard of using any chemical fertilizers, let alone close planting, and I still harvest grain." But after these senior elementary school graduates heard about the new cultivation methods, they quickly accepted the scientific principles behind them and carried out propaganda and mobilization work to the old farmers. Zhang Shumei, a senior elementary school graduate, her mother initially disagreed with using chemical fertilizers and also disagreed with close planting. After Zhang Shumei mobilized her, she agreed to give it a try. Zhang Shumei used chemical fertilizers according to the method introduced in the newspaper, and the millet grew very well. In the past, when planting corn in the eighteenth-grade land, the densest was only 1,500 plants per mu. This year, they tried planting wide ridges with close planting, leaving 2,000 plants, and as a result, the corn grew very well and yielded nearly 100 jin more. Through the facts, she finally convinced her mother. Therefore, some parents said: "Old brains are really not good, it is still faster to have culture and understand the truth." Some said: "As long as these kids work hard, production will definitely be stronger year by year."
    Because many senior elementary school graduates have played an active role in production, the masses respect and praise them. Some parents said: "These kids have not received education for nothing. Now they are producing well, and they will be able to do anything in the future." At present, three of these students who are actively engaged in production have been absorbed into the Communist Youth League, and two have been elected as constituency cadres and people's representatives. The status of female students who are actively engaged in production has also been greatly improved, and men no longer say that they are "money-losing goods."
    In the course of production, many students have truly experienced the glory of labor and the broad prospects of engaging in agricultural production. Some said: "In the past, saying that labor is glorious was empty talk. Now, the food and clothing we eat and wear are all grown by our own hands. At the same time, the grain we grow can also supply industrial construction. This is glory!" Some said: "When the society is well-constructed in the future, someone will ask us, 'What did you do during the first five-year plan!' We will tell him: 'We came from the agricultural front, and the food that the workers eat has our share', and this is also patriotism." These experiences of theirs are very good.
    County and district leading organs should strengthen the education and leadership of senior elementary school graduates
    In the past, the leading personnel of Penglai County and districts and some cadres in the townships did not pay enough attention to the issue of senior elementary school graduates. When the masses were discussing the issue of senior elementary school graduates not being able to go on to further education, many cadres were still indifferent and let it go. It was not until this issue caused a tense situation that the county leading organs realized the seriousness of the problem and began to carry out propaganda and education work. The Penglai County People's Representative Conference held in mid-August repeatedly discussed the issue of senior elementary school graduates as one of the agenda items. After understanding the national economic situation and the reasons why senior elementary school graduates could not all go on to further education, the representatives changed their past dissatisfaction caused by the fact that senior elementary school graduates could not all go on to further education. They expressed that they would definitely help the People's Government solve this difficulty and formulated a plan to publicize to the masses and organize senior elementary school graduates to invest in production. If this work had been paid attention to earlier, the problem would have been solved better. County and district leading organs should accept the experience and lessons learned in dealing with this problem, strengthen the education and leadership of senior elementary school graduates who have not been able to go on to further education and their parents, so that those who have participated in production can produce well, and those who have not participated in production can participate in production.
    The materials from Chaoshui Township prove that as long as we can explain the national economic situation to the masses, explain the development prospects of agriculture, and explain the reason why primary school graduates cannot and should not all go on to further education, the peasants can accept it. This township has held some forums (with the participation of students' parents, party members, village cadres, and old farmers). At the meeting, many students' parents said that the upper-level plan was correct, and we should first build heavy industry because they understood the principle that cultural construction must be subordinate to economic construction. This is like living a life, we should first deal with the big things. Some said: "Now we are laying the foundation (referring to industrial construction), we cannot do everything at once, we have to do it slowly." Some said: "It is not wrong to listen to what Chairman Mao says. What Chairman Mao tells the children to do, they will do." Zhang Enjia, a peasant, has five children in school. This year, two of them graduated from senior elementary school and failed to get into school. At first, he was very dissatisfied with the government, but after he knew the reason why senior elementary school graduates could not completely go on to further education, he said:
  "The country has difficulties, and we should help solve them." Therefore, he immediately made a plan to have his two senior elementary school graduate children participate in production, and they participated in production this autumn. This shows that as long as the county and district leading organs do a good job, they will definitely be able to attract more senior elementary school graduates to agricultural production.
    Judging from the materials from Chaoshui Township, most of the senior elementary school graduates in rural areas should and can be organized into agricultural production.

    关于山东蓬莱县潮水乡高小毕业生参加农业生产的情况调查
    田牧
    可喜的现象
    山东省蓬莱县潮水乡的农民们经常怀着感激的心情，谈论着人民政府为他们办的许多好事。其中的一件就是兴办了学校。
    这乡有一所完全小学，有六百五十个学生，占全乡人口的百分之十八。目前这乡一家有两个孩子上学的共一百四十户，三个孩子上学的共四十户，四个孩子上学的共八户，五个孩子上学的共三户。全乡的学龄儿童都已入学。
    随着学校的扩大，高小毕业生的数目，也就一年比一年增加。一九五一年有三十一个高小学生毕业。当时人们都说：了不起呀，祖辈没有过这么多学生！一九五二年又有六十五人毕业，一九五三年又有七十九人毕业。这种可喜的现象，鼓舞着每一个人。大家都看到农村文化的面貌确实是日新月异地变化着。
    高小毕业生升学问题一度引起了农民思想的混乱
    在高小毕业生逐年增加的情况下，高小毕业生的出路，便成了一个重大的社会问题。三年来，全乡的一百七十五个高小毕业生，升学的有二十六人，占百分之十五弱；外出就业的三十四人，占百分之十九强；在家的一百一十四人，占百分之六十五强。学生升学的数字，虽然在这乡是空前的多，但这和群众升学的要求却还离得很远。一百七十五个高小毕业生，百分之百地要求升学，家长有百分之七十打谱供给孩子上中学。但目前国家经济力量还不容许兴办这么多的中学，使全部高小毕业生都能升学，于是高小毕业生的升学问题，曾经一度引起农民思想的混乱。在中学招生前后，大街小巷都在谈论着升学问题。有的农民见了干部就问：“今年孩子能考上学吗？考不上学怎么办？”听说学校发榜了，许多家长就跑到城里去探听孩子考上没有，到邮局去打听学校来信没有。一听说孩子没有考上，便垂头丧气，牢骚满腹。而没有考取的高小毕业生，更是焦躁。每逢各地招人，他们必到。不少学生跑到烟台，甚至到大连、沈阳等城市找出路。后来因为找不到工作又回到家里，一部分人就投入了生产，一部分人仍然不愿参加生产。有的学生好吃懒作，“饭来张口，衣来伸手”，还和父母成天打闹。农村的政治活动，他们一般也不参加，即便参加也是以知识分子自居，“说三道四”，指手划脚。群众对于这种混乱状况很不满，议论纷纷。
    大批高小毕业生参加了农业生产
    潮水乡的高小毕业生都要升学，都企图离开农村。这不仅是目前国家经济情况所不允许的，从本乡发展农业生产的利益来说也是不允许的。
    老区人民在十几年的革命战争中和在当前国家工业建设中出了大批人力。目前潮水乡共有烈属军属工属二百七十户，外出的农民约近一千人。因此这里的青壮年较少，开始出现了劳动力缺乏的现象。全乡共有土地八千二百二十一亩，共有整劳动力四百九十七个、半劳动力一百七十九个，每个整劳动力平均要负担十三亩土地。
    由于劳动力不足，土地的加工已经受到了相当的限制。全乡烈属军属的代耕地有一千零五亩，平均每个不是烈属军属工属的劳动力须代耕四亩。由于每个劳动力负担的代耕地太多，不能不影响到代耕的质量。目前全乡无劳动力的孤寡户五十一户，在农忙时，往往雇不到人，因此他们每年的收成都不够好。有些必须而又可以种菜的井地，由于劳动力不足，不得不种一般农作物。因此有些老农对高小毕业生的出路有着不同的看法，他们非常希望有一批高小毕业生投入农业生产，并再三挽留去升学的学生。他们怀着对土地深厚的感情对自己的子女说：我们干重活已经不中用了，以后种地就靠你们，你们可不能把地荒了，丢了。但有些高小毕业生没有听老人们的劝解，执拗着非走不可；老农们怕坚决阻止会耽误学生们的“前途”，受埋怨，只好怀着矛盾的心情让他们“碰去”。有的老农白天送走了去考学的儿子，晚上在家偷偷地掉泪，他们生怕“将来生产断了根”。当一些高小毕业生回来的时候，一些老农就说：政府叫你们参加生产是上策。如果都升了学，谁生产？让地荒了吗？那饭也不用吃啦！至于本乡的一些比较有远见的农民，由于他们看到了将来的社会远景和农业生产的广阔前途，认识了要想发展农业生产，必须培养大批有相当文化水平的生产积极分子。因此他们更热烈地欢迎有一批高小毕业生投入农业生产。
    由于党和人民政府的教育，由于先进农民和老农的影响，没有升学的高小毕业生慢慢改变了非升学不可的想法，先后响应了人民政府的号召，投入了生产。
    据统计，三年来，在家的一百一十四个高小毕业生中，有百分之六十积极参加了农业生产，他们在生产上发挥了很大的作用，不少人已成为生产能手。一九五一、一九五二年在家的四十七个高小毕业生，已有十五个成为全村公认的生产能手。例如，一九五一年毕业的学生张子林，今年才十七岁，现在是家庭的生产主角。他自己种了四亩地、一亩园；去年种了八百五十棵大白菜，自己浇水，自己修理，白菜长得很好。去年他响应上级多施肥的号召，用自己推小车“跑运输”赚的钱修了一座猪圈，买了一口小猪，现在小猪长得很肥，粪也积满了圈。人人都羡慕，人人都夸奖。再如一九五二年毕业的女学生周莲舫，刚参加生产时，别人瞧不起她，说：姑娘是赔钱货，参加生产不过是瞎胡闹。但经过一年的劳动锻炼，她已成为全村妇女生产的榜样了。她父亲是个半劳动力，又常病，因此家里的十一亩地全靠她。去年种了一亩葱，二百五十棵大白菜，还种了高粱、棒米。打辘轳浇水、施肥、锄地、耕地等活都是靠她干。她自己还推着小车到三十里地以外去赶集卖菜。
    在互助合作运动中，有不少高小毕业生积极宣传互助组的好处，有的说服自己的家长参加了互助组，有的在互助组中起了积极的作用。一村张子绪互助组是全乡最好的一个。其中有两个青年团员，一个叫张华英，一个叫张淑梅。她们都是去年毕业的，在互助组里劳动最好，被划为整劳动力。她们所耕种的土地的产量每亩比从前增加了五十斤到一百斤。她们经常向群众宣传互助的好处。
    在这批学生没有参加生产以前，许多老农发愁，怕他们的生产技术找不到人传授，“断了弦”。现在，高小毕业生们都在积极地向老农学习生产技术，他们大部学会了打辘轳、挖苗、锄地、施肥等，一部分学会了浸种、选种，有的并学会了耕地、耧地。如一九五二年毕业的学生郑建业，他父亲是个有丰富生产经验的老农，过去很犯愁，怕自己的技术断了根；现在再也不犯愁了，因为他的儿子正在热情地学习他的技术。
    在这批学生未参加生产以前，有些老农还存在着“生产不用文化”的思想。过去推广新的耕作法和改良品种时，有的老农说：“我种了一辈子地没听说用什么化学肥料，更没有用过密植，也是一样打粮。”但这些高小毕业生听到有新的耕作法后，便迅速接受了其中的科学道理，并向老农进行了宣传动员工作。高小毕业生张淑梅的母亲开始时不同意用化学肥料，也不同意密植，经过张淑梅动员，答应试试看。张淑梅根据报纸上介绍的施化学肥料的办法，使用了化学肥料，谷子长得很好。过去种棒米在十八级地里每亩最密才种一千五百棵，今年试种宽垅密植留了两千棵，结果棒米长得很好，多收了近一百斤。通过事实，终于把母亲说服了。因此有的家长说：“老脑筋真不行了，还是有文化懂道理快。”有的说：“这伙孩子只要好好干，生产准一年比一年强。”
    由于许多高小毕业生在生产中起了积极作用，群众对他们又尊重又赞扬。有的家长说：“这伙孩子没有白受教育，现在好好生产，将来干啥也行。”目前这批积极生产的学生有三个被吸收为青年团员，两个被选为选区干部和人民代表。积极生产的女学生们的地位也大大提高了，男人们再没有说她们是“赔钱货”的了。
    在生产当中，许多学生真正体验到劳动的光荣和从事农业生产的远大前途。有的说：“过去说劳动光荣是空的，现在，吃的穿的都是自己亲手种的，同时自己种的粮食还能供给工业建设，这才是光荣呢！”有的说：“将来社会建设好了，有人问我们‘第一个五年计划期间你们干什么来哪！’我们会告诉他说：‘我们在农业战线上来，工人们吃的粮食有我们的一份’，这也是爱国。”他们这些体验是很好的。
    县区领导机关应该加强对高小毕业生的教育和领导
    过去蓬莱县县区的领导人员和乡的一些干部对高小毕业生的问题重视不够。当群众因高小毕业生不能升学而议论纷纷的时候，许多干部还是不闻不问，听之任之。直到这个问题造成紧张情况时，县领导机关才觉察到问题的严重性，开始进行宣传教育工作。蓬莱县八月中旬召开的各界人民代表会议，把高小毕业生问题作为会议议程之一进行了反复讨论。代表们在了解了国家经济情况和高小毕业生不能全部升学的原因后，才改变了过去因高小毕业生不能全部升学而产生的不满情绪，他们表示一定帮助人民政府解决这个困难，并订出了向群众宣传及组织高小毕业生投入生产的计划。如果这项工作注意得早一些，那问题一定会解决得好一些。县区领导机关应该接受在处理这个问题上的经验教训，加强对未能升学的高小毕业生和他们家长的教育和领导，使已参加生产的好好生产，使未参加生产的都参加生产。
    潮水乡的材料证明：只要能够向群众说明国家经济情况，说明农业的发展前途，讲清小学毕业生不能也不应全部升学的道理，农民是可以接受的。这乡曾召开过一些座谈会（有学生家长、党员、村干部、老农参加），会上，不少学生家长因为明白了文化建设必须服从经济建设的道理，都说：上级打算的对，应该先建设重工业，这像过日子一样，应该先依大事办。有的说：“现在是在打基础（指工业建设），不能什么事情一下子都兴办。”有的说：“学校教育已经发展得够快啦，再要多办不是说句空话就行，得慢慢来。”有的说：“听毛主席的话没有错，毛主席叫孩子们干什么，就干什么。”农民张恩家，有五个孩子读书，今年有两个在高小毕业了，去考学没考上，开始对政府很不满，但他知道了高小毕业生为什么不能完全升学的道理以后说：
  “国家有困难，咱应该帮助解决。”因此他马上作好了让两个高小毕业的孩子参加生产的计划，今秋参加了生产。这就说明，只要县区领导机关好好进行工作，就一定能够吸收更多的高小毕业生到农业生产中去。
    从潮水乡的材料看来，农村的高小毕业生，大多数是应该而且可以组织到农业生产中去的。
