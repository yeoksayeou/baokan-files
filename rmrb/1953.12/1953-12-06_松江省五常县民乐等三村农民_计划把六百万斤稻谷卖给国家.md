    Farmers in Minle and Two Other Villages in Wuchang County, Songjiang Province,
    Plan to Sell Six Million Jin of Rice to the State
    In Minle, Xinle, and Fusheng villages in the eighth district of Wuchang County, Songjiang Province, all 1,088 hectares of paddy fields have achieved a bumper harvest this year due to the key promotion of reasonable close planting methods, producing a total of 11 million jin of rice, with an average yield of over 10,000 jin per hectare. This year, the state has reasonably adjusted grain prices, and recently, the publicity and education of the state's general line during the transition period has greatly increased the patriotic enthusiasm of the farmers in these three villages. Many farmers have expressed that they will definitely sell their surplus grain to the state to support national economic construction. The land of the four agricultural production cooperatives and eleven mutual aid teams in these three villages accounts for 60% of the total cultivated land area of the three villages and can produce 6.06 million jin of rice. After deducting public grain, seeds, and food rations, there is still a surplus of 4.06 million jin. These agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams have decided to collectively sell all the surplus grain to the state. The Li Xiujing mutual aid team in Fusheng Village can harvest 350,000 jin of rice and has already signed a contract with the supply and marketing cooperative to sell 200,000 jin of rice. The Li Longji mutual aid team in Xinle Village can harvest 367,000 jin of rice, and they plan to sell 230,000 jin to the state, using the money from the sale to purchase production materials such as ammonium sulfate. Under the impetus of these agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, all farmers in these three villages guarantee to sell 5.3 million jin of rice to the state and strive to sell 6 million jin. At present, all the farmers in the village are working hard from dawn to dusk to speed up the threshing, striving to sell the rice to the state as soon as possible. In the threshing process, they have adopted the method of threshing and sending simultaneously, loading the grain from the threshing ground onto trucks and sending it directly to the supply and marketing cooperative. By November 18, the three villages had sold 1.37 million jin of rice to the state.

    松江省五常县民乐等三村农民
    计划把六百万斤稻谷卖给国家
    松江省五常县第八区的民乐、新乐、富胜等三个村子，今年因为重点推行了合理密植的耕作方法，一千零八十八垧水田全部获得丰收，共计产稻  一千一百万斤，平均每垧产量达一万斤以上。今年国家合理地调整了粮价，最近又展开了国家过渡时期总路线的宣传教育，这三个村的农民爱国热情大大提高。很多农民都表示一定把余粮卖给国家，支援国家经济建设。这三个村的四个农业生产合作社、十一个互助组的土地，占三个村总耕地面积的百分之六十，能产稻谷六百零六万斤，除去公粮，种籽及吃粮，还能余剩四百零六万斤。这些农业生产合作社和互助组决定集体把全部余粮卖给国家。富胜村李秀井互助组能收三十五万斤稻谷，现已和供销合作社订了卖二十万斤稻谷的合同。新乐村李龙吉互助组能收三十六万七千斤稻谷，他们计划卖给国家二十三万斤，用卖稻得到的钱购买硫安等生产资料。在这些农业生产合作社和互助组的带动下，这三个村全体农民保证要卖给国家五百三十万斤稻谷，并争取卖到六百万斤。目前，全村农民正起早贪黑地加紧打场，争取早日把稻谷卖给国家。在打场中，他们采取了边打边送的办法，把粮食从场院装车直接送往供销合作社。到十一月十八日，三个村已卖给国家一百三十七万斤稻谷。
