    Northeast Rural Areas Universally Use Physical Object and Picture Exhibitions to Publicize the General Line
    Farmers' Understanding of Mutual Aid and Cooperation and Expanded Production Greatly Increased
    The propaganda and education work on the general line is being universally carried out in the rural areas of Northeast China. In November, each province (including urban suburbs) trained a large number of county, district, and village-level cadres, propagandists, and activists by holding expanded cadre meetings. Subsequently, a propaganda team composed of hundreds of thousands of cadres, propagandists, and activists went deep into the rural areas to conduct propaganda and education on the general line to the broad masses of farmers. Currently, Jilin Province has 3,000 reporters, 50,000 propagandists, and 100,000 activists engaged in propaganda activities. Since late November, Liaoxi Province has had a propaganda team of over 130,000 people展开in twenty-one counties across the province. By December 7, Heilongjiang Province had launched propaganda work in 269 districts of 34 counties (accounting for 80 percent of the districts in the province). Generally, various localities have used the form of physical object and picture exhibitions in their propaganda, which has been welcomed by the farmers. At the exhibition held in Chaoyang County, Rehe Province, a series of illustrations vividly depicted the lives of the people in two villages, Guan Zhangzi and Ma Zhangzi, in the Daying Zhangzi Village, District Three of the county: Guan Zhangzi Village, due to the implementation of organization, has seen production increase year after year, and the people of the whole village have moved from poverty to prosperity; Ma Zhangzi Village, due to the failure to develop mutual aid and cooperation, has seen increasing class differentiation, and some farmers have already sold their land and are living by doing short-term labor. After seeing this picture, village cadre Liu Xizong said with emotion: "If we don't take the road of mutual aid and cooperation, we will have to repeat the old ways! Ma Zhangzi Village is an example!" Various counties in Heilongjiang Province held forums for youth, women, the elderly, military families, etc., to repeatedly educate them in light of different objects. Designated propagandists are conducting propaganda to farmers in public places such as cinemas, cultural centers, storytelling halls, grain shops, and cart inns in various towns. The Cultural Bureau of Liaoxi Province has sent twenty-one film teams to screen films such as "Golden Star Hero" and "Road to Happiness" for farmers in various places. Various counties in Jilin Province organized labor models and cooperative directors to give reports in various places, using the specific facts and personal experiences of their own villages, cooperatives, and groups to educate the broad masses of farmers.
    After receiving education on the general line, the farmers in Northeast China expressed warm support for the Party's general line and general task during the transition period. They generally reflected: "After studying the general line, we have a direction to strive for. Let's work with peace of mind; following the Communist Party and Chairman Mao is definitely right!" Liu Zongxi, the Party branch secretary of Majia Yingzi Village, Chaoyang County, Rehe Province, said happily after studying the general line: "After studying the general line, it feels like two doors have been opened in my heart. It turns out that we are already sitting on a boat and transitioning to socialism!" They clearly recognized that developing mutual aid and cooperation and taking the socialist road is the direction of rural economic development.
    The enthusiasm of farmers in Northeast China for developing mutual aid and cooperation and expanding production has been unprecedentedly increased, and new agricultural producers' cooperatives and mutual aid groups are being established one after another in rural areas on the basis of voluntary participation by farmers. The members of Qu Chuanyong's mutual aid group in Bao Yingzi Village, Fengcheng County, Liaodong Province, requested the district to help them establish an agricultural producers' cooperative. In Hejiatun Village, District Three, Yixian County, Liaoxi Province, more than seventy households have requested to join or organize agricultural producers' cooperatives. In order to expand production next year, the whole village has ordered 120,000 jin of ammonium sulfate and 1.1 million jin of dried manure from the supply and marketing cooperative. Zhang Weidong, a farmer from Beishang Taizi Village, Guoqian Banner, Jilin Province, bought two horses and a cart after selling 27 dan of grain to the state. He said: "In order to transition to a socialist society sooner and live a better life, we must produce more grain next year to support national construction!"

    东北各地农村普遍用实物和图片展览形式宣传总路线
    农民对互助合作和扩大生产的认识大大提高
    东北各地农村中普遍展开总路线的宣传教育工作。在十一月份内，各省（包括城市郊区）都以召开扩大的干部会议的方式，训练了大批县区村级干部、宣传员和积极分子。接着，由数十万名干部、宣传员和积极分子组成的宣传队伍便深入农村，向广大农民进行了总路线的宣传教育。现在，吉林省有三千名报告员、五万名宣传员和十万名积极分子在进行宣传活动。辽西省自十一月下旬起，有十三万多人的宣传队伍在全省二十一个县内展开了宣传活动。黑龙江省到十二月七日，已在三十四个县的二百六十九个区（占全省区数百分之八十），开展了宣传工作。各地在宣传中一般都运用了实物和图片展览会的形式，受到农民的欢迎。在热河省朝阳县举办的展览会上，有一幅连环画鲜明地描绘了该县三区大营杖子村两个屯人民的生活情景：关杖子屯由于实行组织起来，生产年年上升，全村人民由贫穷走向富裕；马杖子屯由于没有发展互助合作，阶级的分化日益显著，部分农民已卖地，靠卖短工过活。村干部刘希宗看完这幅画后感慨地说：“要不走互助合作的道路，咱们就得车走旧辙呀！马杖子屯就是个样子！”黑龙江省各县分别召开青年、妇女、老头、老太太、军属等座谈会，针对不同对象反复进行教育。各城镇的电影院、文化馆、说书馆、粮栈、大车店等公共场所，都有指定的宣传员在向农民进行宣传。辽西省文化局已派出二十一个电影队，给各地农民放映了“金星英雄”、“幸福之途”等影片。吉林省各县组织劳动模范、合作社主任等到各地作报告，用本村、本社、本组的具体事实和切身体验，向广大农民进行教育。
    受到总路线教育后，东北各地农民对党在过渡时期的总路线和总任务，表示热烈的拥护。普遍反映：“学习总路线以后，有了奔头了。放心地干吧，跟着共产党和毛主席走没错！”热河省朝阳县马家营子村党支部书记刘宗喜学习总路线后，高兴地说：“学习了总路线，心里好像打开了两扇门，原来咱们已经坐在船上正往社会主义过渡着哪！”他们明确认识了发展互助合作走社会主义道路，是农村经济发展的方向。
    东北各地农民空前地提高了发展互助合作和扩大生产的积极性，农村中新的农业生产合作社和互助组正在农民自愿的基础上纷纷成立起来。辽东省凤城县包营子村曲传永互助组组员们，要求区上帮助他们建立农业生产合作社。辽西省义县三区贺家屯村要求加入或组织农业生产合作社的已有七十多户。为了扩大来年生产，全村已向供销合作社订购了硫安十二万斤、粪干一百一十万斤。吉林省郭前旗北上台子村农民张维东卖给国家二十七石粮后便买进两匹马、一辆车。他说：“为了早点过渡到社会主义社会，过更好的生活，明年还得打更多的粮食，支援国家建设！”
