This victory encourages all employees of the plant to strive to complete the national plan and the production increase and savings plan ahead of schedule.
    All employees and technicians of No. 1 Blast Furnace were very excited after listening to the Party Committee's report on the general line of the country during the transitional period on November 20th, and then overfulfilling the production increase and savings tasks from September to December. The employees of No. 1 Blast Furnace enthusiastically discussed the general line of the country during the transitional period and proposed to increase the production of pig iron by 1,800 tons for the country by the end of the year. The water watch team managing the blast furnace cooling equipment guarantees that the blast furnace will not have accidents due to poor cooling equipment, and strives to be a model team. The Party, administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League organizations of No. 1 Blast Furnace have mobilized employees to focus on inspecting equipment, and have revised the group covenants through the trade union. Now, the employees of No. 1 Blast Furnace are excitedly engaged in a new battle. (Zuo Linshu, An Ruihua)
