Yunnan Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region

Increases Rice Production by Over 20 Million Jin

    The Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region in Yunnan Province reaped a bumper harvest of rice and early rice this year. The total rice production in the region increased by approximately 24 million jin. The Dai farmers living in the plains generally have surplus grain, and many ethnic minority farmers in the traditionally grain-deficient Manbie mountainous area are also beginning to have surplus grain. Many high-yield households have emerged in various parts of the autonomous region. Bai Tingrong, a Dai high-yield farmer in Mengyang, Banna, achieved a maximum yield of 1,000 jin of rice per mu, more than double the local average yield. In addition to supplying the needs of the people of all ethnic groups in the region, the rice produced by the autonomous region this year will also be sold to the state to support industrial construction.

    The Autonomous Region People's Government actively leads and assists the people of all ethnic groups in developing production. This year, a total of 492 irrigation canals were built throughout the region. In Jinghong and Mengzhe, Banna alone, the newly built and rebuilt irrigation canals stretched for 160 li. Among them were the two major water conservancy projects of Meng Xu Zai and Mengzhe Nai, which the Dai people had longed to repair for more than a century but were unable to. As a result, more than 10,000 mu of dry land and previously water-deficient rice fields in Jinghong, Banna, have all been irrigated. Mengzhe, Banna, also increased rice production by 3 million jin due to water conservancy construction and newly reclaimed land. The Autonomous Region People's Government also pays attention to guiding farmers in mountainous areas to develop production. This year, ten villages in the Suhu mountainous area of the Gelanghe Hani Autonomous Region expanded the planting area of dry rice by one-third of the original area. (Xinhua News Agency)

    云南西双版纳傣族自治区
    增产稻谷二千多万斤
    云南省西双版纳傣族自治区今年水稻、早稻丰收，全区共约增产稻谷二千四百万斤。居住在平坝里的傣族农民普遍有了余粮，历来缺粮的曼别山区，也有许多少数民族农民开始有了余粮。自治区各地出现了很多丰产户。版纳勐养的傣族丰产户白廷荣种植的水稻每亩最高产量达一千斤，超过当地一般产量一倍以上。自治区今年所产的稻谷，除供应本区各族人民食用外，并将余粮卖给国家，支援工业建设。
    自治区人民政府积极领导和帮助各族人民发展生产。今年全区共兴修水渠四百九十二条。仅版纳景洪和版纳勐遮两地新修和重建的水渠就长达一百六十华里，其中有傣族人民盼望了一百多年而无法修复的勐许宰和勐遮耐两个较大的水利工程，也在今年修好了。因此版纳景洪一万多亩旱地和往年缺水的稻田全部得到了灌溉。版纳勐遮也因修水利和新开荒地而增产稻谷三百万斤。自治区人民政府并注意领导山区农民发展生产。格朗和爱尼族自治区苏湖山区十个村寨今年扩大旱谷种植面积达原来面积的三分之一。（新华社）
