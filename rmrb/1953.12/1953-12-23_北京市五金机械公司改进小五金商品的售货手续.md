    Beijing Hardware Machinery Company
    Improving Sales Procedures for Small Hardware Items
    Letter from Beijing Company of China National Hardware & Machinery Corporation: Wang Kuijing's criticism in the "Reader's Letters Summary" column on November 8th regarding the overly complicated sales receipts for small hardware items in our company is correct. We accept the criticism and have already printed and are using a new format for the receipts. The new format receipt is drafted according to actual needs, reducing the number of copies from seven to six, allowing for the entry of six items at a time (originally only three), and allowing goods from different countries to be entered together (originally they had to be separated). The number of stamps on the receipts has been greatly reduced; in order to reduce waiting time for customers, except for the invoice and bill of lading that must be given to customers at the time, the rest are stamped after business hours every day.

    北京市五金机械公司
    改进小五金商品的售货手续
    中国五金机械公司北京市公司来信：十一月八日“读者来信摘要”栏中，王魁经同志对我公司小五金商品售货票据太繁复的批评是对的。我们接受批评，已经印制和使用新格式的票据了。新格式票据是根据实际需要拟定的，一联由七张减到六张，一次可开六件商品（原只能开三件），不同国别的货物也可以开在一起了（原来必须分开）。票据上盖章数量已经大大减少；为了减少顾客等候时间，除了必须当时交给顾客的发票及提单立刻盖章外，其余都在每天营业时间后盖章。
