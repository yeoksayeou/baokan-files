    Liu Ansen Persistently Fights Bureaucrats Who Disregard State Property
    Saving Over Three Thousand Tons of Steel Beams from Loss

    In April of this year, the People's Supervisory Office of the Ministry of Railways, based on materials from a letter of complaint from Liu Ansen, foreman of the paint shop of the Changsha Repair Factory of the Wuhan Bridge Engineering Bureau of the New Railway Construction Engineering Bureau (formerly the Changsha Engineering Repair Factory of the Guangzhou Railway Administration Engineering Department, hereinafter referred to as the Repair Factory), sent a working group to inspect the leadership cadres of the Repair Factory, the Surplus Materials Committee, and other units for not valuing the rationalization proposals of employees and allowing a large number of steel beams to rust in the open air. This incident has been dealt with, and the relevant derelict personnel have been disciplined accordingly. Liu Ansen was commended in an order issued by the Ministry of Railways on September 28 for protecting state property and actively making suggestions to higher authorities, preventing more than three thousand tons of steel beams, worth hundreds of billions of yuan, from rusting.

    After liberation, the Guangzhou Railway Administration and other departments successively stored more than three thousand tons of steel beams in the Repair Factory, most of which were unused. However, the leading cadres of the Repair Factory treated this property with an irresponsible attitude, piling it haphazardly on the soil and in puddles, allowing it to be exposed to the elements, and the steel beams quickly developed rust two or three millimeters thick. Although the leading cadres of the factory saw the steel beams rusting every day, they did not care, and did not actively find ways to preserve them. At the end of 1951, Liu Ansen was transferred from the Hengyang Engineering Repair Factory to the Repair Factory, and the first thing he saw was this batch of severely rusted steel beams, which caused him great distress. In January 1952, he actively put forward his opinion to the factory director, requesting that the steel beams be painted and properly maintained. The factory director reflected this opinion to the original Hengyang Railway Administration Engineering Department, asking them to forward it to higher authorities for approval.

    Two months passed without any news. Liu Ansen was anxiously waiting, when Guo Weicheng, director of the original Hengyang Railway Administration, happened to come to the factory in March. He was determined to tell Director Guo about this opinion face-to-face. But he thought, "Forget it, Director Guo is so busy, how can he manage these things?" However, when he looked at the steel beams again, the rust on them was getting thicker and thicker, and when he grabbed it with his hand, the rust fell off in chunks. He felt extremely sad, and his courage returned. Finally, he told Director Guo, and then wrote Director Guo a written suggestion. Soon, Director Guo replied, telling him that he had asked the materials department to prepare paint, and the bureau had also notified them to make a plan.

    In August, Liu Ansen prepared a budget plan for sorting out the steel beams and happily sent it up. The plan arrived at the original Hengyang Railway Administration, and after being reviewed by the Engineering Department, it was reported to the Ministry of Railways by the Surplus Materials Committee. In early November, the Ministry of Railways instructed that the painting expenses be paid from the business expenses for handling quantitative external materials. However, Pan Shining, the person in charge of the Surplus Materials Committee, and his secretary, Lin Heda, were unwilling to take money "outward" from the business expenses. They did not notify the Engineering Department, nor did they ask for instructions from higher authorities, and they simply accumulated the official documents. The Engineering Department, which had reviewed the budget, did not ask if the Ministry of Railways had approved it. The Repair Factory, which had made the budget itself, thought that it had "completed its responsibility" after the budget was submitted, and did not inquire about it any further.

    The official documents were piled up, and the steel beams were still exposed to the elements, the rust becoming more and more serious, and the accessories were incomplete. Liu Ansen eagerly waited for news. By February of this year, it was clear that if the steel beams rusted a little more severely, they would become substandard and become scrap. He was extremely anxious. He remembered that when supporting the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project and making the Huangshantou Sluice Gate, he heard that a steel plate six meters long and one and a half meters wide cost more than 20 million yuan. How much would these three thousand tons of steel beams be worth! He made up his mind to save this batch of steel beams. Therefore, he wrote a letter to Minister Teng Daiyuan of the Ministry of Railways. In the letter, he criticized the leadership's long-term failure to solve the steel beam problem and the bureaucratic attitude of disregarding the people's property, and asked the Ministry of Railways to solve it quickly. He was sure that Minister Teng would support him. Sure enough, soon the People's Supervisory Office of the Ministry of Railways replied to him, telling him that they would deal with the matter soon, and then sent someone to investigate, and the approval that had been piled up for more than five months was found.

      On June 1 of this year, the steel beam sorting work finally began. Liu Ansen was overjoyed. In the steel beam sorting work, Liu Ansen again used his brains to create a distillation heating method and a paint mixer, using 11,800 kilograms of waste materials (paint), saving the country more than 160 million yuan. All the workers also displayed a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity, completing the sorting task fourteen days ahead of schedule, while the quality reached 99.6 percent.

    刘安森向漠视国家财产的官僚主义者坚持斗争
    使三千多吨钢梁没有遭到损失
    今年四月间，中央人民政府铁道部人民监察室根据新建铁道工程总局武汉大桥工程局长沙修配厂
  （原广州铁路管理局工务处长沙工务修配厂，以下简称修配厂）油漆车间工长刘安森来信检举材料，派出工作组检查了修配厂、多余物资委员会等单位领导干部不重视职工合理化建议，听任大批钢梁露天锈蚀的事件。这一事件已经处理完毕，有关失职人员已分别受到处分；刘安森因为爱护国家财产，积极向上级提出建议，使价值数百亿元的三千多吨钢梁未被锈坏，在九月二十八日铁道部发出的部令中受到表扬。
    解放后，广州铁路管理局等部门陆续在修配厂存放了三千多吨钢梁，这些钢梁大部分都是没有用过的。但是，修配厂领导干部却以不负责任的态度对待这批财产，乱七八糟地堆放在泥土上、水洼里，任它风吹雨打，钢梁很快地就生了两三分厚的锈。该厂领导干部虽然每天都看见钢梁在被锈蚀，却都不在意，不积极设法加以保管。一九五一年年底，刘安森从衡阳工务修理厂调到修配厂来，第一眼就看见了这批被严重锈蚀着的钢梁，感到无限痛心。一九五二年一月间，他就积极地向厂长提出意见，要求油漆这批钢梁，好好加以保养。厂长把这个意见反映给原衡阳铁路管理局工务处，要他们转报上级批示。
    两个月过去了，没有一点消息。刘安森正在焦急地等待着，恰好原衡阳铁路管理局郭维城局长在三月间来到厂里，他决心要把这个意见当面告诉郭局长。但他又想：“算了吧，郭局长事情这么忙，他能管得了这些事情吗？”可是，他再看钢梁，上面的锈一层一层地厚起来，用手一抓，锈就一块一块地往下掉，他难过极了，勇气又上来了，终于告诉了郭局长，接着又给郭局长写了一封书面的建议。不久，郭局长来了回信，告诉他已叫材料处准备油漆，局里也通知他们做计划。
    八月间，刘安森做好了整理钢梁的预算计划，满心高兴地送了上去。计划到了原衡阳铁路管理局，经过工务处审查，由多余物资委员会报告了铁道部。十一月上旬，铁道部指示油漆费用在处理定量外材料业务费内开支。但是，多余物资委员会的负责人潘世宁和秘书林荷达却不愿在业务费内“往外”拿钱，他们没有通知工务处，也不向上级请示，就把公文积压下来。曾经审核过预算的工务处，也没有追问这件事铁道部批了没有，做预算的修配厂自己预算出了门，就认为“完了责任”，也再不催问。
    公文被积压下来，钢梁仍然任风吹雨打，锈越来越厉害，配件也残缺不全了。刘安森眼睁睁地盼望着消息，直到今年二月间，眼看这批钢梁只要再锈得严重些，就将不合规格而变成废品了。他十分焦急。他记得在支援荆江分洪工程做黄山头节制闸时，听说一块六公尺长、一公尺半宽的钢板就要两千多万元，这三千多吨钢梁要值多少钱呢！他下了决心，一定要挽救这批钢梁。于是，他给铁道部滕代远部长写了一封信，在信里，他批评了领导上长期不解决钢梁问题，漠视人民财产的官僚主义态度，要求铁道部赶快解决。他确信滕部长一定会支持他的。果然，不久铁道部人民监察室就给他回了信，告诉他很快就处理这件事，接着便派人来进行了调查，被积压了五个多月的批示才被查了出来。
      今年六月一日，钢梁整理工作终于开始了。刘安森高兴得不得了，在钢梁整理工作中，刘安森又开动脑筋创造了蒸馏加热法和绞漆机，利用了废料（油漆）一万一千八百公斤，为国家节约了一亿六千多万元。全体工人也都发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，提前十四天完成了整理任务，同时质量达到百分之九十九点六。
