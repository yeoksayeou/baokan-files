Xinhua News Agency, December 7th. Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China sent a notification to the United Nations General Assembly regarding the current situation in Korea. The full text is as follows:

To Mr. Hammarskjöld, Secretary-General of the United Nations in New York, and to Madam Pandit, President of the United Nations General Assembly:

I. The situation in Korea has now developed to a serious stage. The explanation work to the prisoners of war by the Korean and Chinese side has only been carried out for seven days, and after the fifth forced suspension, it has been unable to resume for as long as twenty days, and thus the agreement on the repatriation of prisoners of war in the Korean Armistice Agreement has been seriously damaged; at the same time, the talks between the two parties to the Korean Armistice Agreement held in Panmunjom on the issue of the political conference have also encountered major difficulties, and the convening of the political conference has been conspired to be delayed.

II. The secret order recently intercepted by the Indian Custodial Forces from Park Dong-hyuk, a South Korean secret agent, to the agents of Li Seung-man and Chiang Kai-shek infiltrated into the POW camps by the US military headquarters, is the most fundamental exposure and the most complete confirmation of the above-mentioned situation regarding the POW issue. This secret order shows that the US military authorities directly command the Li-Chiang secret agent elements in the POW camps, implement inhumane terrorist policies, disrupt the explanation work and prevent the POWs from applying for repatriation, in order to completely destroy the explanation work and realize their consistent conspiracy to forcibly detain more than 20,000 captured personnel from the Korean and Chinese side.

According to the provisions of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission", the time limit for the explanation work to prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated was originally set at ninety days, but the explanation work of the Korean and Chinese side, since it began on October 15th, has only been carried out for a total of seven days due to various crazy obstruction and sabotage activities by the Li-Chiang secret agent elements under the command of the US military. These secret agent elements used force and terrorist methods such as murder and heart extraction to persecute the POWs, obstructed and sabotaged the explanation work in various ways, and threatened the POWs not to leave the camp to listen to the explanation. Recently, the explanation work of the Korean and Chinese side was suspended and has not been restored because the US side's secret agents did not allow the isolation of the POWs who had listened to the explanation and those who had not listened to the explanation according to the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Access Work" stipulated by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. Even after the Korean and Chinese side agreed to the conditions proposed by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, that is, agreed that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission would build isolation facilities, as long as the Korean and Chinese side did not carry out explanations to other camp areas before the explanation of one camp area was completed, the isolation facilities were still not built, and thus the situation of the explanation being suspended remained the same. However, the explanation work of the United Nations forces was able to proceed smoothly because the Korean and Chinese side provided isolation facilities in accordance with the provisions of the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Access Work" and isolated the POWs who had listened to the explanation and those who had not listened to the explanation. This contrast clearly shows that the implementation of the "Terms of Reference" and the progress of the explanation work of the Korean and Chinese side depend on the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission resolutely exercising its legal powers in accordance with the provisions of the "Terms of Reference" to realize its control over the POW camps and break the secret agent organizations and violent control of the POW camps. If this is not the case, then the explanation work will not be able to proceed at all, and the "Terms of Reference" will be completely destroyed.

III. The talks between the two parties to the Korean Armistice Agreement on the political conference have been going on for six weeks. During this period, the US negotiator has been implementing the delaying policy predetermined by his government. The US side delayed for eighteen days on the issue of agreeing on the agenda of the bilateral talks alone; later, in the group discussions on the issues of members and locations and time, it delayed for another twelve days. Since the Korean and Chinese side put forward fair and reasonable comprehensive suggestions on the political conference on November 30, the US side has created some unnecessary disputes and delayed for five days, and there is still no hope of a solution. On the one hand, the US representative brazenly obliterated the fact that the Soviet Union has always maintained neutrality in the Korean War and made great contributions to promoting the Korean armistice, disregarded Article 37 of the Korean Armistice Agreement regarding the definition of neutral countries, insisted on sending the Soviet Union to participate in the conference and vote on one side of the warring parties in Korea, and stubbornly denied the neutral status of the Soviet Union; on the other hand, they imposed various unreasonable restrictions on the participation of other neutral countries in the political conference, attempting to prevent the neutral countries from playing their due role in the political conference. At the same time, on the issue of location and time, the US government has been delaying in every possible way and has never conducted serious discussions. In this way, the entire bilateral talks have fallen into a stalemate in the endless debate deliberately arranged by the US side.

The reason why the US negotiator wants to drag the bilateral talks into such endless arguments not only shows that the US government has no sincerity in convening a political conference to seek a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, but also exposes their evil purpose: they are deeply afraid of discussing the POW issue in the political conference. They attempt to take unilateral action to forcibly detain the captured personnel of the Korean and Chinese side after completely destroying the explanation work, so they strive to delay the conference beyond January 22, their so-called POW detention deadline. The speeches of US negotiator Dean, the clamor of Li Seung-man, and many reports from the US news agencies completely confirm this point.

IV. According to the above facts, it can be seen that the current serious situation in Korea is entirely caused by the US government's evil policy of attempting to undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement, forcibly detain POWs, obstruct the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue in order to continue to maintain international tensions. This situation not only strikes a blow to the world people's desire for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, but is also brewing serious consequences. If the United Nations General Assembly evades its responsibility and indulges the US government to do whatever it wants in this situation, it will further increase the seriousness of the Korean situation, and the United Nations will become more of a tool for the US government to create international tensions.

V. In view of this, we believe that we have a responsibility to notify the United Nations General Assembly of this situation through Your Excellency.

VI. I request Your Excellency to distribute this document and two attachments to all member states except the Kuomintang remnant group in the United Nations General Assembly.

VII. Please accept my highest respect, Your Excellency!

Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China
December 7, 1953, in Beijing

### 我中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长  就朝鲜问题目前局势通知联合国大会

    我中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长
    就朝鲜问题目前局势通知联合国大会
    【新华社七日讯】中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长就朝鲜问题目前局势致联合国大会的通知。全文如下：
    纽约联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德先生并转联合国大会主席潘迪特夫人阁下：
    一、朝鲜的局势目前发展到了严重的阶段。朝中方面对战俘的解释工作只进行了七天，在第五次被迫停顿之后，已达二十天之久未能恢复，因之朝鲜停战协定中关于战俘遣返的协议已经遭受到了严重的破坏；同时，在板门店举行的关于政治会议问题的朝鲜停战缔约双方会谈也已遭遇到重大的困难，政治会议的召开已被阴谋拖延。
    二、最近印度看管部队所截获的南朝鲜特务朴东赫传达给美军总部派出混在战俘营中的李承晚、蒋介石特务们的密令，就是上面关于战俘问题所述形势最根本的揭露和最完全的证实。这一密令显示，美国军事当局直接指挥战俘营中的李蒋特务分子，执行惨无人道的恐怖政策，捣乱解释工作和阻止战俘申请遣返，以便将解释工作彻底破坏，来实现其强迫扣留两万多名朝中被俘人员的一贯阴谋。
    根据“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的规定，对不直接遣返战俘的解释工作的期限原定九十天，但是朝中方面的解释工作，自十月十五日开始以来，由于美军指挥下的李蒋特务分子进行种种疯狂阻挠和破坏活动，迄今一共只进行了七天。这般特务分子使用武力和杀人、挖心等恐怖手段来迫害战俘，对解释工作进行了各种阻挠和破坏，并威胁战俘不许出营听取解释。最近，朝中方面的解释工作，竟因美方特务不许按照中立国遣返委员会规定的
  “解释和访问工作细则”来隔离已听解释和未听解释的战俘而停顿至今，不能恢复。甚至在朝中方面同意中立国遣返委员会提出的条件之后，即同意中立国遣返委员会将修建隔离设备，只要朝中方面在解释完毕一个营场前，不对其他营场进行解释之后，隔离设备仍然未曾修建，因之解释停顿的情况依然如故。但是，联合国军方面的解释工作，却由于朝中方面按照“解释和访问工作细则”的规定提供了隔离设备，隔离了已听解释和未听解释的战俘，因此联合国军方面的解释工作得以顺利进行。这一情况的对比，显然说明“职权范围”的实施和朝中方面解释工作的进行都有待于中立国遣返委员会坚决根据“职权范围”的规定行使其合法权力，来实现其对于战俘营的控制，并打破战俘营的特务组织和暴力控制。如果不是这样，那么解释工作必将根本不能进行，“职权范围”必将破坏无遗。
    三、关于政治会议的朝鲜停战缔约双方会谈，已经进行了六个星期。在这一时期中，美国谈判代表一直执行着他的政府所预先规定的拖延政策。仅仅在商定双方会谈的议程问题上，美方就拖延了十八天；后来在成员和地点问题及时间问题的分组讨论中，又拖延了十二天。自朝中方面在十一月三十日提出了关于政治会议的公平合理的全面建议以来，美方又制造了一些不必要的争论，拖延了五天，迄今仍无解决之望。美方代表一方面蛮横抹煞苏联在朝鲜战争中始终保持中立并对推动朝鲜停战具有重大贡献的事实，悍然不顾朝鲜停战协定第三十七款关于中立国的定义，硬要把苏联派在朝鲜交战双方中的一方来参加会议和表决，顽固地否认苏联的中立国地位；另一方面，他们又对其他中立国之参加政治会议提出种种无理限制，企图使中立国在政治会议中不能发生应有的作用。同时，在地点和时间问题上，美国政府又是一味拖延，从来没有进行过认真的讨论。这样，整个双方会谈就陷于美方所蓄意安排的无休止的辩论中而形成了僵局。
    美国谈判代表之所以要把双方会谈拖进到这样无止境的争论中去，不仅表现了美国政府对于召开政治会议谋求和平解决朝鲜问题并无诚意，而且还暴露了他们的一个罪恶目的：他们深怕在政治会议中讨论战俘问题，他们企图在彻底破坏解释工作之后，采取片面行动强迫扣留朝中方面被俘人员，所以才力求把会议拖过一月二十二日他们所谓的战俘拘留期限。美国谈判代表迪安的发言、李承晚的叫嚣和美国通讯社的许多报道，完全证实了这一点。
    四、根据上述事实可以看清，朝鲜当前的严重局势，完全是美国政府企图破坏朝鲜停战协定、强迫扣留战俘、阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题以便继续保持国际紧张局势的罪恶政策所造成的。这种局势不仅使世界人民要求和平解决朝鲜问题的渴望受到了打击，而且正酝酿着严重的后果。联合国大会对于这种情况，如果逃避责任，纵容美国政府为所欲为，则将更增加朝鲜局势的严重性，联合国亦将更加成为美国政府制造国际紧张局势的工具了。
    五、有鉴于此，我们认为有责任经过阁下将这种情况通知联合国大会。
    六、我要求阁下将这个文件及两个附件在联合国大会上散发给除国民党残余集团以外的各会员国。
    七、阁下，请接受我最高的敬意！
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长  周恩来
     一九五三年十二月七日于北京
    附件一、一九五三年十一月三十日朝中方面全面建议（见一九五三年十二月一日本报第一版）；
    二、一九五三年十一月八日印度看管部队截获的联合国军方面特务朴东赫转达的李承晚、元容德和国民党残余集团驻南朝鲜代理机关的秘密指令（见一九五三年十一月二十七日本报第一版）。
