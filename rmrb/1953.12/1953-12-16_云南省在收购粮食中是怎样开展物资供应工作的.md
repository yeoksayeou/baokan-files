Yunnan Province's state-owned commercial and cooperative systems are actively strengthening the supply of various materials to rural areas in coordination with the state's grain procurement. Many stores, trading companies, and cooperatives have completed or exceeded their sales targets. The Yuxi County State-Owned Department Store completed 123.01% of its total sales plan in the third quarter. In October, to support grain procurement, the store expanded its commodity circulation plan but still managed to complete 108.5%. The China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company's Xiaguan branch completed 119% of its sales plan in October, supplying large quantities to farmers and ethnic minority areas, further meeting the needs of rural areas and fraternal ethnic regions. Thanks to the active supply efforts of state-owned commercial departments and cooperatives, grain procurement has been greatly promoted. The progress of grain purchase work in Yunnan Province proves that state-owned commerce and cooperatives must coordinate with grain purchase work to complete and exceed sales targets.

The reason why the state-owned commercial and cooperative systems in Yunnan Province can actively carry out material supply work is mainly due to the clear instructions of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to strengthen the work of material supply in the process of grain procurement by state-owned commercial and cooperative provincial-level leading organs. Party committees at all levels have strengthened their leadership over local state-owned cooperative financial and economic departments, conducting ideological mobilization from within the Party to outside the Party and from top to bottom, making them realize the political significance of the state's grain procurement and the close relationship between material supply and grain procurement coordination. The Yunnan Provincial Department of Commerce held a special meeting to determine that the current task of the state-owned commercial system is to cooperate with grain procurement and ensure material supply. The specific approaches are:

	One, unify the steps of state-owned commerce and cooperatives, and overcome the one-sided view of emphasizing profits for the sake of completing turnover tasks. In terms of material distribution, it prevented the phenomenon of blind requests for goods and transfers in various places under the pretext of heavy grain purchase tasks. In terms of business scope, the CCP committees and financial committees at all levels actively instructed and led the division. Some materials should be supplied by state-owned commercial departments to cooperatives according to specific circumstances and directly supplied to farmers. For example, the local cloth produced in the province is uniformly processed by cooperatives and supplied to farmers. The Provincial Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company also vigorously supplies it, which makes it easier for provincial departments to allocate and supply in a planned and step-by-step manner.

	Two, the CCP committees and financial committees at all levels strengthen the leadership of market management work from the perspective of policies and ideas as well as specific practices, and overcome the impetuous emotions of the industrial and commercial administrative departments in market management. Through the study of the general line and general task of the state, all localities have realized the important role of the state-owned economy in the transition period, correctly implemented policies, and earnestly educated and transformed private industry and commerce. The province has managed the main materials, and private merchants must go through certain procedures for purchase within a certain quantity, and are not allowed to suppress prices or raise prices for rush purchases. Under the leadership of the CCP Provincial Committee and the Provincial Financial and Economic Commission, the Yunnan Provincial Department of Commerce paid attention to the supply of major commodities in key cities, industrial and mining areas, and state-owned commercial and cooperatives at all levels cooperated to supply organs, troops, etc.

	Three, under the unified leadership of local Party committees and financial committees, state-owned commerce and cooperatives in various places actively organize local sources of goods, overcoming the idea of relying on the province or other places to transfer "famous brand products." The currently popular local cloth is processed locally with raw materials supplied by the province, except for some adjustments. Mengzi Prefecture has arranged for the processing of local cloth to account for 50% of the original plan. Other agricultural tools and non-staple foods such as vermicelli, wrought iron, bellows, and sieves are also processed and supplied locally. Under the leadership of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the CCP and the Provincial Financial and Economic Commission, the Provincial Department of Commerce and the Provincial Federation of Cooperatives are grasping the work of transferring goods and striving for fast transfer and fast transportation. At the end of October, the Provincial Department of Commerce, the Federation of Cooperatives, the Grain Bureau, the Salt Administration, and department stores, trading companies, cotton yarn and cloth companies, and other units established a collective office system of "three-day meeting." At present, state-owned commercial departments regard the work of transferring materials as a combat mission. In addition, under the leadership of Party committees and financial committees, state-owned commercial and cooperative systems in various places organized the masses of mules and horses to strengthen short-distance transportation, greatly accelerating the transfer and supply of materials.

In addition, the specific methods of material supply work of the state-owned commercial and cooperative systems in Yunnan Province are: strengthening the investigation and research work on the needs of farmers, and overcoming the phenomenon of blind allocation; actively expanding temporary supply points, going deep into rural areas to supply, so that commodities can directly meet with farmers, and facilitating farmers to sell and buy at the same time; holding small-scale rural exchange meetings, and carrying out supply in combination with purchase points. In the supply, attention has been paid to publicity work, and the quality and specifications of commodities should be publicized and compared, gradually overcoming the old habits and conservative ideas of farmers, and expanding the variety of sales.

At present, there are still some problems and shortcomings in the supply work of state-owned commerce and cooperatives in Yunnan Province. In particular, the procedures for transferring materials from top to bottom are cumbersome and time-consuming, and they cannot reach the salesmen in a timely and rapid manner, forming "commodity rest," which cannot keep up with the development of the grain purchase situation. Secondly, the investigation and research work is not detailed enough, resulting in blind sales. The organization of local handicraft product sources is still of poor quality and low profit. There is also not enough correct utilization of small wholesalers and urban and rural retailers between urban and rural areas, and not enough attention is paid to the political and ideological education of salesmen, which all need to be seriously improved.

    云南省在收购粮食中是怎样开展物资供应工作的
    施明扬
    云南省国营商业和合作社系统，配合国家收购粮食，积极加强对农村的各种物资供应工作，很多商店、贸易公司及合作社都完成或超额完成销售任务。玉溪县国营百货商店第三季度完成总销售计划百分之一百二十三点零一。十月份，该店为配合粮食收购，扩大了商品流转计划，但仍能完成百分之一百零八点五。中国花纱布公司下关支公司十月份完成销售计划的百分之一百一十九，大量供应农民及少数民族区，进一步满足了农村及兄弟民族地区的要求。由于国营商业部门、合作社积极供应，大大推动了粮食收购工作。禄丰县腰站乡是全县的丰产乡，开始收购时每天只能收进二、三百斤，后来合作社与国营商业密切联系，充分供应农民农具、种籽、百货、生活用品等，因而在一天中购进了稻谷一万七千多斤，收购量比开始时增加了五、六十倍。云南省购粮工作的开展，证明了国营商业和合作社要完成和超额完成销售任务，必须配合购粮工作。
    云南省国营商业和合作社系统所以能积极开展物资供应工作，主要是由于中共云南省委会明确指示国营商业、合作社省级领导机关加强对购粮工作中的物资供应工作。各级党委加强对当地国营合作社财经部门的领导。从党内到党外、从上而下地进行思想动员，使其认识到国家收购粮食的政治意义及物资供应和购粮工作配合的密切关系。云南省商业厅特召开会议，确定了当前国营商业系统的任务是配合购粮，保证物资供应。其具体做法是：
      一、统一国营商业和合作社的步调，克服各自为了回笼任务强调利润的片面观点。在物资分配上，防止了各地藉口购粮任务重而盲目要货调货现象。在经营范围上由中共党委及各级财委积极指示领导，明确划分。有些物资应根据具体情况由国营商业部门供给合作社，直接供应农民。如该省出产的土布，由合作社统一加工供应农民。省花纱布公司并大力供应，这样就便于省级部门有计划有步骤地调拨供应。
    二、各级中共党委和财委从政策思想上以及具体做法上加强对市场管理工作的领导，克服工商行政部门对市场管理的急躁情绪。各地通过国家总路线总任务的学习，认识了国营经济在过渡时期的重要作用，正确执行政策，认真教育改造私营工商业。全省对主要物资进行了管理，私商收购要在一定数量内，办理一定手续，不准压价抬价抢购等。云南省商业厅在中共省委和省财委的领导下，注意了几个重点城市工矿地区的主要商品供应问题，机关、部队等都由各级国营商业和合作社配合供应。
    三、各地国营商业、合作社在当地党委、财委统一领导下，积极组织地方货源，克服了依靠省里或外地调运“名牌货”思想。目前畅销的土布除部分调剂外，各地都由省里供给原料在当地适当加工。蒙自专区已布置加工土布数占原计划百分之五十。其他如粉丝、熟铁、风箱、筛子等农具和副食品也在当地加工供应。在中共云南省委会及省财政经济委员会的领导下，省商业厅和省合作社联合社抓紧下调工作，争取快调快运。十月底，由省商业厅、合作社联合社、粮食厅、盐业管理局及百货公司、贸易公司、花纱布公司等单位建立了“三日碰头会”的集体办公制度。当前国营商业部门把下调物资工作当作战斗任务。此外，各地国营商业及合作社系统在党委、财委领导下，组织群众骡马加强短距离运输，大大加速了物资的调运和供应。
    另外，云南省国营商业和合作社系统的物资供应工作的具体方法是：加强对农民需要的调查研究工作，克服盲目调拨现象；积极扩充临时供应点，深入农村供应，使商品直接和农民见面，便利农民边卖边买。举办农村小型交流会，结合收购点开展供应。在供应中重视了宣传工作，对商品品质规格要加以宣传对比，逐渐克服农民旧习惯和保守思想，扩大推销品种。
    目前云南省国营商业和合作社在供应工作中尚存在着若干问题和缺点，特别是从上而下的物资调运手续麻烦，耽误时间，不能及时而迅速地到达推销员手里，形成“商品休息”，跟不上购粮的形势发展。其次对于调查研究工作还不够细致。盲目推销，对当地手工业品货源组织仍嫌品质差利润低。还有对于正确利用城乡之间小批发商与城乡零售商做得不够，对于推销员政治思想教育工作不够重视，这些都是需要认真改进的。
