The State Council of the Central People's Government
Instructions on Carrying Out Winter Agricultural Production
(Adopted at the 198th meeting of the State Council on December 17, 1953)

I. Winter production is an extremely important preparatory step for next year's agricultural production. In some areas of the south, winter is still an important production season. Although there are many work tasks in the rural areas in the winter of 1953, agricultural production work must still be the overriding center in the rural areas, and all work must serve the requirements of developing production. For example, in the tense task of collecting public grain and purchasing grain, we must strictly implement the policies stipulated by the Central Government. We must conscientiously use the method of persuasion and education, and pay attention to arranging winter production for the masses in a timely manner. We must complete the state's grain tasks and encourage the enthusiasm of farmers for production, and prepare for the various aspects of agricultural production in 1954, laying the foundation for increased production in 1954. Other tasks should also serve agricultural production as the center, without exception. Of course, this does not mean that all other tasks in the rural areas besides agricultural production are canceled. All necessary and feasible economic and political work should still be actively carried out, but the content of all this work and the steps and methods of its implementation, as well as the arrangement of time, should all be subordinate to agricultural production, and must not hinder agricultural production. Anything that would hinder farmers from carrying out winter production must be considered for changes in steps, methods, and timing, or even be stopped.

II. Agricultural production has been growing continuously in recent years, and it is still necessary to ensure that major agricultural products such as grain, cotton, and oil crops continue to increase on the basis of several years of increased production. All localities have formulated their own 1954 production increase plans in accordance with the 1954 production increase target control figures set by the State Planning Commission. Therefore, a series of measures must be taken starting this winter to ensure the completion of this production increase plan. Only by completing this plan can we ensure the balanced development of all sectors of the national economy, meet the growing living needs of urban and rural people, and consolidate market and price stability. Under the favorable conditions created in many ways in recent years, it is entirely possible to complete the target figures for agricultural production increase, and some temporary difficulties still exist, but they can also be overcome. In order to make the target figures for agricultural production increase a reality in 1954, we must first regard the winter production of 1953 as an important link, put in more effort, and mobilize the masses to do it well. People's governments at the county, district, and township levels, and people's governments at the provincial level and their agricultural departments that have the conditions, should, under the leadership of the local Party committee, lead the masses and, through methods such as mutual aid and cooperation representative meetings and labor model conferences, conduct a review and summary of agricultural production in 1953, put forward requirements and measures for increasing production in 1954 in accordance with local conditions, publicize and promote effective local experience in increasing production, and plan the work that should be started this winter, and take action immediately. State-owned farms and agricultural technology promotion stations should actively help farmers do a good job in winter production from a technical point of view according to the needs of local farmers.

III. The primary task in winter production is to develop agricultural mutual aid groups and agricultural production cooperatives. Developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement is the only way to carry out the socialist transformation of the small-scale peasant economy, is the road to consolidating the victories already won in various democratic reforms in the countryside and guiding farmers to continue to move forward, and is the main reliance for the vast number of farmers to overcome difficulties, further develop production, and improve their lives. Only through mutual aid and cooperation and taking the socialist road can we realize the state's requirement to greatly increase grain and other agricultural products in order to meet the needs of socialist industrialization and the needs of the continuous improvement of people's lives. Existing agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups must seize the time this winter to conduct summaries, rectify and improve them, and further consolidate achievements, overcome shortcomings, consolidate the good unity between members within the groups and cooperatives and between the groups and cooperatives and the surrounding masses of farmers, and welcome the production increase tasks in 1954. All personnel working in the countryside must, in accordance with the Central Government's instructions on the general line during the transition period, conduct education on the socialist prospects for farmers in a proper and cordial manner, encourage farmers to participate in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and move step by step towards the broad road of socialism with common labor and common prosperity. Running existing agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups well is also the most powerful form of persuasion and education for farmers. After education and persuasion, further develop mutual aid groups in large numbers on the basis of the farmers' level of awareness and on the basis of the farmers' voluntary participation. Generally speaking, running mutual aid groups well is the basis for developing agricultural production cooperatives; at the same time, in new areas, agricultural production cooperatives should be established on a trial basis by the county, and in old areas, agricultural production cooperatives should be established on a trial basis by the district. Running agricultural production cooperatives well can drive the great development of mutual aid groups. All localities should plan to do a good job in training cadres and all other preparatory work, and strive to complete the development plan for agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups this winter before the spring plowing in 1954, so as not to delay spring plowing production. In order to prevent the development plan for mutual aid and cooperation from failing in this winter's tense work, the heads of leading organs in various localities must personally take action, uniformly arrange time, properly organize forces, and assign special personnel to be responsible for completing the plan on schedule. Whether it is existing or newly developed agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups, they must regard increasing production and increasing income as their goals and strive to gradually improve in terms of farming technology, business management, and distribution system, or exchange labor and find price systems, so that every farmer who participates in the organization can obtain the benefits they deserve, in order to attract individual farmers to voluntarily participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations in increasing numbers.

IV. In terms of specific measures for winter production, the main tasks are:

First, in areas where winter crops are planted, winter wheat, small spring crops, and other winter crops must be well managed to increase spring and summer harvests next year. In areas where winter plowing is still possible, winter plowing should continue to be vigorously organized to preserve soil moisture, eliminate insects, and cultivate soil fertility. In general areas, the masses should be called upon to inspect and sun-dry reserved seeds, and use winter leisure to do a good job in indoor seed selection. Attention should also be paid to solving the difficulties of cotton farmers with cotton seeds and farmers in disaster areas who lack seeds.

Second, universally mobilize the masses to accumulate and produce fertilizer. The area of ​​cultivated land fertilized and the amount of fertilizer applied have increased in recent years, and the amount of commercial fertilizer supplied by state-owned commercial and supply and marketing cooperatives to rural areas has also increased year by year, but the phenomenon that the supply of commercial fertilizer falls short of demand has already occurred and is difficult to change quickly. Natural fertilizers must be greatly increased in order to overcome the current difficulty of insufficient sources of commercial fertilizer. Governments at all levels must explain this situation to the masses and point out that increasing the application of natural fertilizers has many benefits for cultivating soil fertility. They should lead the masses to carry out mass winter fertilizer accumulation and production work in accordance with local conditions to ensure that the amount of cultivated land fertilized in 1954 will still increase under the conditions of insufficient commercial fertilizer.

Third, build and repair farmland water conservancy projects to prevent droughts and floods and ensure high and stable yields on large areas of cultivated land. Generally speaking, in the south, the main task is to repair ponds, dams, and weirs, and to build small reservoirs under the conditions of large returns, low investment, and certain technical guidance. Attention should also be paid to inspecting existing farmland water conservancy projects, improving their effectiveness, and ensuring safety in order to increase water storage capacity and prevent mountain floods. In the north, the main task is to repair wells and ditches, and to universally implement land improvement, water storage, and moisture preservation to prevent spring droughts. In farmland water conservancy work, it is necessary to learn from past successful experiences and the lessons of failure of forced commandism and formalism in some areas. It must be carried out after discussion and approval by the relevant masses based on local needs and possible conditions and the economic burden capacity of the masses. In farmland water conservancy work, special attention must be paid to combining it with the mutual aid and cooperation movement, fully utilizing the labor force saved by organizing to build farmland water conservancy, and using the construction of farmland water conservancy to help consolidate and improve mutual aid and cooperation.

Fourth, maintain livestock. In some areas in 1953, livestock diseases and epidemics occurred, resulting in mass deaths. This loss must be quickly remedied, and the occurrence of livestock epidemics must be actively prevented, especially in winter. Protecting livestock through the winter is an important task at present, especially in pastoral areas, which must be approached from many aspects. On the part of the masses, attention should be paid to storing feed, setting up pens, and protecting livestock health; on the part of the government, attention should be paid to organizing veterinarians to help farmers treat sick livestock. Developing animal husbandry and developing livestock side occupations in agricultural areas are beneficial to increasing natural fertilizer, increasing the income of farmers and herdsmen, and ensuring the growing need for meat supply, and should be actively promoted; however, the feed problem should be solved well to prevent the phenomenon of large-scale waste of grain due to feed. The local government should try to help solve the feed supply problem for livestock in disaster areas. In addition, more appropriate purchase prices for cowhide should be stipulated to prevent excessively high prices, some excessively mechanical regulations in the method of prohibiting the slaughter of draft animals should be changed, the exchange of draft animals between regions should be promoted, and the phenomenon of unreasonable remuneration for animal power in some mutual aid and cooperation organizations should be corrected in order to promote the breeding of draft animals.

Fifth, help farmers increase the purchase and repair of agricultural implements. Supply and marketing cooperatives and state-owned commerce should, in accordance with the production conditions in various places and the needs of the local masses, and in combination with the technical guidance of agricultural departments, actively and steadily promote new agricultural implements. In the past, the promotion of new agricultural implements was generally successful, but there were also some shortcomings and problems, mainly manifested in the commandist work methods and only taking care of sales but not repairs, and not actively guiding farmers on how to use them. This phenomenon has been greatly improved since this spring. In the future, in the work of promoting new agricultural implements, we must still pay attention to correcting and preventing this problem. At the same time, supply and marketing cooperatives and state-owned commerce must systematically supply handicraft workers who manufacture old-fashioned agricultural implements with pig iron and wood to solve the difficulty of insufficient raw materials; and through supply and marketing business organizations, organize handicraft workers to manufacture agricultural implements according to the quality and styles required by local farmers. Local governments should pay attention to organizing a number of handicraft workers to go to the countryside in a timely manner to repair the agricultural implements that need to be repaired on the spot. In coastal areas, attention should also be paid to helping fishermen add and repair fishing nets and develop fishery production.

Sixth, organize winter sideline production to increase farmers' income and increase farmers' investment in agricultural production. Relevant departments of governments at all levels should guide farmers and individual farmers who participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations to use their leisure and surplus household labor to increase wealth and develop sideline production in this area that has raw materials and sales channels, but it is necessary to resolutely avoid blind investment and blind development. The sideline production of farmers in mountainous areas and the winter production of forest farmers should be actively organized and developed.

Seventh, do a good job in the issuance and recovery of agricultural loans this winter. In order to vigorously carry out winter production, appropriate loans should be given to some poor farmers who really need loans. On the other hand, it is necessary to cooperate with the characteristics of the larger task of purchasing agricultural products this winter and the large amount of cash in the hands of farmers to do a good job in the recovery of overdue loans. Only by doing a good job in the recovery of overdue loans this winter can we more forcefully support the loan needs of farmers during the 1954 production season.

V. Since the state commercial organs' purchases of agricultural products this winter have increased compared with previous years and are relatively concentrated, the currency exchanged by farmers urgently needs to be used to purchase the means of production and living that they need. Therefore, according to different regions and different needs, systematically supplying farmers with the necessary industrial products and handicraft products, especially the means of production, has become a major and urgent task for state-owned commerce and supply and marketing cooperatives. Whether this huge material supply work can be done well is most directly related to the success or failure of agricultural production in 1954. On the one hand, all personnel working in rural areas must pay attention to educating farmers so that they understand how to cherish their labor fruits and use the income to add to the means of production and the necessities of life that must be added. If it is not possible to prepare all the suitable spot goods for farmers on the market at once, farmers should save the money that is temporarily not used in the People's Bank and credit cooperative organizations, or use it to order the means of production they need from the supply and marketing cooperative for use next spring. Do not waste it indiscriminately, which will lead to difficulties next year. If possible, they should also take out part of the cash or savings to purchase public bonds to support national economic construction; on the other hand, state-owned commerce and cooperatives must also investigate the needs of farmers, organize goods to go to the countryside as much as possible, and pay special attention to supporting those handicrafts whose products are suitable for the needs of local farmers, make high-quality and low-priced products to meet the requirements of farmers and help complete the state's purchase tasks. Various localities can also hold some small-scale material exchange fairs according to local economic conditions to develop commodity exchanges between counties and between districts and meet the needs of both supply and sales. When holding material exchange fairs, we should neither blindly pursue the exchange figures stipulated in compulsion, nor should we pay attention to formal ostentation and cause mass waste.

VI. Special attention must be paid to strengthening production and disaster relief work in disaster areas, quickly helping all residents in disaster areas overcome difficulties, restore productivity, and complete all production preparation work that should be completed. Agricultural production in non-disaster areas in 1953 all increased, but the national agricultural production increase plan failed to be realized due to the occurrence of floods and droughts in some areas. If we do not actively strive to quickly restore the productivity of the disaster-stricken areas, the agricultural production increase in 1954 will also be affected to a certain extent. Therefore, in these areas, we must seize the opportunity to use all material resources, financial resources, and manpower to organize production for self-rescue, carry out sideline production, solve the difficulties in the lives of disaster victims, make up for the losses of means of production, drain accumulated water, repair land, and treat patients and sick livestock. All production forces and all cultivated land must continue to play their due role in the 1954 production campaign, and the production increase in 1954 will be used to make up for the loss of the production increase plan that was not completed due to disasters in 1953.

VII. In ethnic minority areas, whether they are agricultural areas, pastoral areas, or agro-pastoral areas, winter production work should be firmly grasped. However, the economic conditions in ethnic minority areas are different from those in general areas, and the economic conditions between ethnic minority areas are not entirely the same. The people's governments of various ethnic minority areas should arrange the local winter production work according to the specific conditions of the local areas and according to the spirit of this instruction. Similarly, we must strive to further increase production, increase the wealth of the people, and improve the lives of the people in the winter production work in order to further increase production, increase the wealth of the people, and improve the lives of the people.

It is hoped that the people's governments at all levels will seriously implement the above tasks with reference to the local conditions, and strive to do a good job in the production work this winter, strive to complete and overfulfill the development plan for agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups this winter, and strive to complete and overfulfill the agricultural production increase plan for 1954, so that agricultural production adapts to the speed of industrial development and gradually achieves corresponding balanced development, so that the state's socialist transformation of agriculture and our country's socialist industrialization can cooperate and move forward.

专栏：

    中央人民政府政务院
    关于开展冬季农业生产工作的指示
    （一九五三年十二月十七日政务院第一百九十八次政务会议通过）
    一、冬季生产工作是明年农业生产的极重要的准备步骤。在南方某些地区，冬季也还是重要的生产季节。一九五三年冬农村中工作任务虽然繁多，但仍须以农业生产工作作为在农村中压倒一切的中心，一切工作均须服务于发展生产的要求。例如在紧张的征收公粮和收购粮食的任务中，也必须严格地贯彻中央所规定的政策。认真地运用说服教育的工作方法，并注意及时地安排群众冬季生产，必须做到既完成国家的粮食任务，又使农民的生产积极性得到鼓舞，做好一九五四年农业生产的各项准备，为一九五四年的增产打下基础。其他各项工作，也应以服务于农业生产为中心，不能例外。当然这并不是说，在农村中除农业生产外，取消其他各项工作。一切必要的可行的经济工作和政治工作仍应积极进行，不过这一切工作的内容及其进行的步骤和方法以及在时间的安排上均应服从于农业生产，而不能妨害农业生产。凡足以妨害农民进行冬季生产者，均须在步骤方法和时间上考虑改变，以至停止进行。
    二、几年来农业生产是不断增长的，今后仍须保证粮食、棉花、油类作物等主要农产品，在几年增产的基础上继续增加。各地已按照国家计划委员会所定的一九五四年增产指标控制数字，拟出本地区的一九五四年增产计划，因此必须从今冬起，采取一系列的措施，来保证这一增产计划的完成。只有完成这一计划，才能保证国民经济各部门的平衡发展，满足城乡人民正在增长中的生活需要，巩固市场和物价的稳定。在几年来从多方面所创造的有利条件下，完成农业增产的指标数字，是完全可能的，有些暂时性的困难还存在着，但也是可以克服的。为使农业增产的指标数字在一九五四年成为现实，首先就必须将一九五三年的冬季生产当作一个重要环节，多加一把力，发动群众做好它。县区乡人民政府和有条件的省人民政府及其农业部门，应在当地党委的领导之下，领导群众，通过互助合作代表会和劳动模范会议等方式，对一九五三年的农业生产进行一次评比总结，因地制宜地提出一九五四年增产的要求和措施，宣传推广当地行之有效的增产经验，并计划好今冬即应着手进行的工作，即时行动起来。国营农场和农业技术推广站应根据当地农民的需要，从技术上积极帮助农民做好冬季生产工作。
    三、冬季生产工作中的首要工作就是发展农业互助组和农业生产合作社。发展互助合作运动，是对小农经济实行社会主义改造的必经之路，是巩固农村中各项民主改革的已得的胜利并引导农民继续前进的道路，是广大农民克服困难、进一步发展生产、改善生活的主要依靠。也只有互助合作，走社会主义的道路，才能实现国家的大量增产粮食和其他农产品的要求，以适应社会主义工业化的需要，适应人民生活不断提高的需要，对现有的农业生产合作社和互助组，必须在今年冬季抓紧时间进行总结，加以整顿和提高，并进一步地巩固成绩，克服缺点，巩固组、社内部成员之间的和组、社与周围农民群众之间的良好团结，迎接一九五四年的增产任务。所有在乡村工作的人员，均须依据中央关于过渡时期总路线的指示，以妥善亲切的方式向农民进行社会主义的前途教育，鼓励农民参加互助合作运动，一步一步地向着共同劳动、大家富裕的社会主义的康庄大道前进。办好现有的农业生产合作社和互助组，也就是对农民的一种最有力的说服教育。经过教育说服工作，根据农民的觉悟程度，在农民自愿的基础上进一步地大量发展互助组。一般说来，办好互助组是发展农业生产合作社的基础；同时，在新区普遍地由县试办、老区由区试办农业生产合作社，办好农业生产合作社是可以带动互助组大发展的。各地应有计划地做好训练干部和其他一切准备工作，争取在一九五四年春耕以前，完成农业生产合作社和互助组在今年冬季的发展计划，不要耽误春耕生产。为在今冬的紧张工作中防止互助合作发展计划落空，各地领导机关的负责人均须亲自动手，统一安排时间，适当组织力量，责成专人负责，如期完成计划。不论是现有的和新发展的农业生产合作社和互助组，均须将提高生产增加收入当作自己的奋斗目标，力求在耕作技术、经营管理和分配制度、或换工找价制度等方面获得逐步的改善，使参加组织的农民人人得到应得的利益，以吸引个体农民日益增多地自愿参加互助合作组织。
      四、在冬季生产的具体措施方面，主要的几项工作是：
    第一、在种植过冬作物的地区，必须经营好冬麦、小春作物及其他过冬作物，增加明年的春收和夏收。在尚能冬耕的地区，应继续大力组织冬耕，以保墒、除虫，培养地力。在一般地区应号召群众检查翻晒已留种籽，利用冬闲做好室内选种工作。并应注意解决棉农的棉种和灾区农民缺少种籽的困难。
    第二、普遍发动群众积肥造肥。耕地施肥面积和施肥数量，年来均有增加，国营商业和供销合作社对农村的商品肥料供应额也逐年扩大，但商品肥料供不应求的现象，业已发生，且难于迅速改变。必须大量增加自然肥料，才能渡过目前商品肥源不足的困难。各级政府必须向群众讲明这种情况，并指出增施自然肥料对培养地力有很多好处，领导群众，因地制宜地开展群众性的冬季积肥造肥工作，保证一九五四年在商品肥料不足的条件下耕地施肥数量仍有增加。
      第三、兴办和整修农田水利，预防水旱灾害，保证大量耕地的高产稳收。一般的讲：在南方，主要是修整塘坝圩堰，在收益较大而投资不多并有一定技术指导的条件下兴修小型水库。并注意检查已有的农田水利工程，提高效用，保证安全，以增加蓄水能力，防止山洪灾害。在北方，主要是修井，整渠，并普遍地实行修整土地，蓄水保墒，预防春旱。在农田水利工作中，必须吸取过去成功的经验和某些地区的强迫命令形式主义的失败教训，必须依据当地需要与可能的条件和群众的经济负担能力，经有关群众讨论通过后始得进行。在农田水利工作中，尤须注意与互助合作运动相结合，充分应用组织起来而节省出的劳动力来兴修农田水利，又以农田水利之兴修来帮助巩固和提高互助合作。
    第四、保养牲畜。一九五三年有的地区，曾发生牲畜病疫，成批死亡，这一损失必须迅速补救，冬季尤须积极预防畜疫发生。保护牲畜过冬是当前的一项重要工作，在畜牧区尤其重要，这须从多方面着手。群众方面应注意储备饲料，设置圈棚，保护牲畜健康；政府方面，应注意组织兽医帮助农户医治病畜。发展畜牧业，发展农业地区的畜牧副业，对增加自然肥料，增加农牧民的收入，保证肉食供应之日益增长的需要，都有好处，应积极提倡；但应很好解决饲料问题，防止发生因饲料而大量浪费粮食的现象。灾区牲畜的饲料供应问题，当地政府应设法帮助解决。此外，并应规定更恰当的牛皮收购价格，防止偏高，把禁止屠宰耕畜办法中某些过分机械的规定加以改变，提倡地区间的耕畜交流，以及端正某些互助合作组织中畜力报酬不合理的现象，以促进耕畜的繁殖。
    第五、帮助农民增置和修补农具。供销合作社和国营商业应根据各地的生产条件和当地群众的需要，并与农业部门的技术指导相结合，积极稳步地推广新式农具。过去在推广新式农具方面一般是有成绩的，也存在着部分的缺点和毛病，主要的表现是命令主义的工作方法和只管推销不管修理，不积极指导农民如何使用，这种现象今春以来有了很大的改善，今后在推广新式农具工作中，仍须注意纠正和防止这种毛病。同时，供销合作社和国营商业必须有计划地供应制造旧式农具的手工业者以生铁和木材，解决他们的原料不足的困难；并通过供销业务组织手工业者按当地农民所需要的质量与样式来制造农具。各地政府须注意适时组织若干手工业者下乡，对需要修补的农具就地予以补修。在沿海地区还须注意帮助渔民添置和修补船网，发展渔业生产。
    第六、组织冬季副业生产，以增加农民的收入，增加农民对农业生产的投资。各级政府有关部门，应指导参加互助合作组织的农民和个体农民，根据当地需要与可能条件利用自己的农闲的和家庭剩余劳力去增殖财富，发展在本地区有原料有销路的副业生产，但须切实避免盲目投资，盲目发展。山区农民的副业生产和林农的冬季生产，尤须积极注意组织和发展。
    第七、做好今冬农业贷款的发放与收回的工作。为大力开展冬季生产，对一部分确实需要贷款的贫困农民应适当贷给必要数目的贷款。而另一方面又必须配合着今冬农产品收购任务较大、农民手中现款较多的特点，做好到期贷款的收回工作。也只有做好今冬到期贷款的收回工作，才能更有力地支援农民一九五四年生产季节中的贷款需要。
    五、由于今冬国家商业机关对农产品的收购量较往年增加，也比较集中，农民换得的货币，亟需买进他们所需要的生产和生活资料，因此，按着不同的地区和不同的需要，有计划地供应农民以必需的工业产品和手工业产品，尤其是生产资料，就成为国营商业和供销合作社的一项重大而紧急的任务。这项巨大的物资供应工作能否做好与一九五四年的农业生产的好坏有最直接的关系。一方面所有在农村工作的人员，必须注意教育农民，使他们懂得爱护自己的劳动果实，将进款用于添制生产资料和必须添置的生活必需品方面，如市场上不可能一下子备齐农民合用的现货，农民就应该把暂时不用的钱储蓄于人民银行和信用合作组织、或用以向供销合作社定购自己所需要的生产资料，以备来春使用，万不可胡花浪费，引来明年的困难，如有可能，更应拿出一部分现款或储蓄，用于购买公债，以支援国家经济建设；另一方面国营商业和合作社，也必须调查农民的需要，尽可能地组织货品下乡，特别应注意扶助那些产品适合当地农民需要的手工业，制成物美价廉的产品，以满足农民的要求，帮助完成国家的收购任务。各地还可根据本地经济条件举办一些小范围的物资交流会，借以发展县与县间和区与区间的商品交流，满足供销双方的需要。在举办物资交流会时，既不应盲目追求勉强规定的交换数字，更不应讲求形式上的铺张，造成群众性的浪费。
    六、必须特别注意加强灾区的生产救灾工作，迅速地使灾区全体居民渡过困难，恢复生产力，完成一切应该完成的生产准备工作。一九五三年非灾区的农业都是增产的，但因部分地区发生水旱灾情，而使全国的农业增产计划未能实现。如不积极努力把受灾地区的生产力迅速恢复起来，一九五四年的农业增产也将会受到一定的影响。因此，在这些地区必须抓紧时机利用一切物力、财力和人力，组织生产自救，进行副业生产，解决灾民生活上的困难，弥补生产资料的损失，排除积水，整修土地，医治病人、病畜，要使全部生产力量和全部耕地在
  一九五四年的生产运动中照旧发挥出应有的作用，以一九五四年的增产来弥补一九五三年因灾害而未完成增产计划的损失。
    七、在少数民族地区，无论是农业区、畜牧区或农牧交错区，冬季生产工作都是应该抓紧的。但少数民族地区的经济条件不同于一般地区，少数民族地区彼此之间经济条件也不尽相同，各少数民族区的人民政府应根据当地的具体条件，根据这一指示的精神，布置当地的冬季生产工作。同样，要在冬季生产工作中，争取一九五四年更进一步地增加生产，增殖人民的财富，提高人民的生活。
    以上各项工作，望各级人民政府参照当地情况认真执行，务期努力做好今冬的生产工作，争取完成和超额完成农业生产合作社和互助组的今年冬季的发展计划，争取完成和超额完成一九五四年的农业增产计划，使农业生产适应着工业发展的速度，逐步地取得相应的平衡发展，使国家对农业的社会主义改造工作与我们国家的社会主义工业化得以配合前进。
