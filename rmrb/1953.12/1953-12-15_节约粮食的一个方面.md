    One Aspect of Saving Food
    How to reduce grain consumption in livestock breeding is an aspect of saving food that cannot be ignored. The Ningbo Dazhong (Masses) Daily in Zhejiang, based on the local situation of grain waste caused by the lack of pig feed, carried out effective publicity on solving the pig feed problem in September and October.
    In September, the Ningbo Dazhong Daily received many letters from readers reflecting the serious situation of grain waste caused by the lack of pig feed. With the improvement of production and living standards, the number of farmers in the Ningbo area raising pigs for fertilizer has increased year by year. For example, farmers in Yuyao County raised twice as many pigs this year as last year. Precisely because the number of pigs has increased rapidly, and many farmers use rice bran as the only feed for pigs, a shortage of rice bran has formed. Some pig farmers, in order to obtain more rice bran, do not hesitate to grind rice into bran or mill the rice into refined white rice. Originally, every hundred catties of rice could be milled into more than seventy catties of rice, but now only about sixty catties are milled, resulting in a loss of about ten catties of rice per hundred catties of rice after processing. This has caused a serious waste of grain. Based on the reflections of the masses, the Ningbo Dazhong Daily analyzed and studied this common and prominent problem. The editorial department also invited representatives from the Special Commissioner's Office, the Grain Bureau, the cooperative, and cadres from Jingjia Township in the suburbs of Ningbo City to discuss and further explore solutions to the pig feed problem. On September 29, the newspaper published an article entitled "How to Solve the Problem of Pig Feed?" and a commentary entitled "Resolutely Solve the Problem of Pig Feed." In addition to exposing the serious situation of grain waste in pig feed, educating the masses to conscientiously save grain, and calling on various regions, township governments, and grain departments to discuss with the masses to effectively solve this problem, the newspaper also introduced the method of "fine grinding of rice husks" to increase the production of bran without wasting grain. That is, in processing plants without sand hulling equipment, use raw grain machines to process, milling brown rice and coarse bran, and then use rice machines to process, milling medium white rice and coarse bran. According to experiments in the Xinchang area, this method can yield 71 catties of rice and 28.5 catties of coarse bran per hundred catties of rice, which not only does not waste grain, but also increases rice bran production by more than three times (normally, only 6-7 catties of bran are produced per hundred catties of rice). If there is a sand hulling machine in the processing plant, it is even more convenient. The newspaper also addressed the idea among farmers that "pigs are not accustomed to eating grass feed," analyzed the eating habits of pigs, and pointed out that in addition to rice bran and wheat bran, there are many good feeds, such as weeds in the fields, algae in rivers and ponds, duckweed, taro vines, pumpkin vines and leaves, waste leaves of vegetables, etc.; and introduced the methods of preparation, storage, and feeding of these many things to meet the eating habits of pigs and prevent pig diseases.
    Because the pig feed problem raised by the Ningbo Dazhong Daily is related to the interests of the country and the vital interests of the farmers, it has attracted the attention of the farmers and the grain department. For example, Xu Liangyu, a farmer from Yin County, wrote to the newspaper saying that in order to obtain more bran, he only milled 55 catties of rice per hundred catties of grain; if he followed the method introduced by the Ningbo Dazhong Daily, he could save 540 catties of rice every year. Dongming Production Self-Help Processing Plant in Chengguan Town, Sheng County, and Yin County Grain Bureau and other units have used their brains to find tricks, adopting fine grinding of rice husks and other methods, which not only improved the rice yield and saved grain for the country and farmers, but also increased the production of bran to better meet the needs of farmers raising pigs. The newspaper disseminated the experiences of these units.
    The pig feed problem reflected by the Ningbo Dazhong Daily has also attracted the attention of the local leading organs. The Ningbo Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China has issued instructions on mobilizing the masses to solve the pig feed problem, requiring all localities to effectively solve the pig feed problem under the guidance of increasing production and practicing economy; and pointed out that "in the future, different requirements should be put forward for pig raising according to different regions, the pig raising habits of the masses, and the amount of feed sources, and the past practice of blindly calling for 'every household to raise pigs' in some regions should be corrected."
    In the movement to increase production and practice economy, the Ningbo Dazhong Daily has taken an active and proactive attitude to raise and solve economic and livelihood issues related to the fundamental interests of national construction and the vital interests of the masses. This approach is worthy of attention. (Zhong Xiuda, Wu Jiakai)

### 节约粮食的一个方面

    节约粮食的一个方面
    在饲养牲畜中如何减少粮食的消耗，是节约粮食的一个不容忽视的方面。浙江宁波大众报在九、十月间曾根据当地由于猪食缺乏而造成的浪费粮食的情况，对解决猪食问题进行了有效的宣传。
    九月间，宁波大众报收到很多读者来信，反映了由于猪食缺乏而造成的浪费粮食的严重情况。随着生产和生活水平的提高，宁波专区广大农民养猪积肥的逐年增多；例如馀姚县农民今年饲养的猪就比去年多两倍。正因为猪的数量增加得很快，而许多农民又将米糠作为猪的唯一饲料，就形成米糠供应不足的现象。有些养猪户为了多得米糠，不惜拿稻谷碾成糠末，或者把米轧得精白，原来每百斤谷可碾米七十多斤，现在只碾成六十斤左右，每百斤谷加工后少出米达十斤左右。这就造成了粮食的严重浪费。宁波大众报根据群众的反映，对这一普遍而突出的问题进行了分析研究。编辑部并邀请专署、粮食局、合作社等单位的代表和宁波市郊惊驾乡的干部座谈，进一步探求解决猪食问题的办法。九月二十九日报纸发表了“怎样解决猪的饲料问题？”的文章和“切实解决猪的饲料问题”的评论。报纸除揭露了在猪食方面浪费粮食的严重情况，教育群众认真节约粮食，并号召各地区、乡政府和粮食部门多和群众商量切实解决这个问题外，还介绍了“砻糠轧细”这一在不浪费粮食的原则下增加糠的产量的办法。即在没有砂砻设备的加工厂，用生谷机加工，碾出糙米和大糠，然后再用米机加工，碾出中白米和粗糠。据新昌地区试验，这样每百斤谷可得米七十一斤、粗糠二十八斤半，不但不浪费粮食，而且增产米糠三倍多（平常每百斤谷仅出糠六、七斤）。如在有砂砻的加工厂，则更方便。报纸还针对农民中存在的“猪吃不惯草料”的思想，分析了猪的食性，指出除了米糠和麸皮以外，还有不少好饲料，如田间野草、河塘中的水藻、浮萍、芋艿蕻、南瓜藤叶、菜的废叶等等；并介绍了这许多东西的调制、贮藏、喂饲的方法，以符合猪的食性，防止发生猪病。
    正因为宁波大众报所提出的猪食问题关系到国家利益和农民的切身利益，因而引起了农民群众和粮食部门的重视。如鄞县农民徐良玉写信给报社说，他为了多得糠，每百斤谷只碾米五十五斤；如参照宁波大众报所介绍的办法去做，每年就能节省大米五百四十斤。嵊县城关镇东明生产自救加工厂和鄞县粮食局等单位都动脑筋找窍门，采用砻糠轧细及其他办法，既提高了出米率，为国家和农民节约了粮食；又增加了糠的产量，更好地满足了农民养猪的需要。报纸传播了这些单位的经验。
    宁波大众报所反映的猪食问题，也引起了当地领导机关的重视。中共宁波地委已发出关于发动群众解决猪食问题的指示，要求各地在贯彻增产节约的方针下，切实解决猪食问题；并指出“今后应根据不同地区、群众养猪习惯和饲料来源的多少，对养猪提出不同要求，纠正过去某些地区盲目号召‘家家养猪’的作法”。
    宁波大众报在增产节约运动中，以积极、主动的态度来提出并解决有关国家建设根本利益和群众切身利益的经济生活问题，这种作法是值得重视的。　（钟秀达、吴家凯）
