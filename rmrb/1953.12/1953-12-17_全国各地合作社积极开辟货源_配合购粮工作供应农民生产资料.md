Cooperative Societies Across the Country Actively Explore Sources of Goods to Coordinate Grain Purchase Work and Supply Farmers with Production Materials

[Reported by this newspaper] Cooperatives across the country are actively supplying farmers with production materials to coordinate with the purchase of grain, cotton, hemp, tobacco and other industrial raw materials.

Since the autumn harvest, cooperatives in various regions have focused on the supply of agricultural production materials. For example, in Tong County, Hebei Province, agricultural production materials account for 35.21 percent of the goods prepared by the cooperatives in the fourth quarter; in Baoshan County, Jiangsu Province, the value of production materials already prepared in the fourth quarter reached 6.7 billion yuan, an increase of 1.8 times over the same period last year. Cooperatives in Northwest China, Inner Mongolia, Shandong, Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, Rehe, Heilongjiang and other places have all launched livestock exchange businesses. According to statistics from 26 county cooperatives in Shandong Province, more than 5,000 head of livestock were exchanged for farmers after the autumn harvest; according to incomplete statistics from Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia provinces, cooperatives have supplied farmers with more than 3,400 head of livestock; seven grassroots cooperatives in Yuci County, Shanxi Province, helped farmers exchange 1,311 head of livestock at small-scale material exchange meetings held in October and mid-November. In terms of agricultural implement supply, cooperatives in six special districts, including Zhengzhou and Xuchang in Henan Province alone, supplied farmers with 9,105 waterwheels, 8,406 walking plows, and 186,000 small agricultural implements in September.

At present, cooperatives in many areas have actively prepared for the supply of production materials for this winter and next spring. For example, the Northwest District Cooperative plans to supply 6,100 head of livestock and 2,000 carts (large and small) this winter and next spring. The Shandong Provincial Cooperative plans to supply small agricultural implements with a total value of 100 billion yuan. According to statistics from 15 provinces and cities within the customs, supply and marketing cooperatives have prepared 430,000 tons of oilseed cakes; by the end of the first quarter of next year, about 190,000 tons of chemical fertilizers can be supplied. In order to supply the needs of rural areas for manufacturing agricultural implements and building houses next spring, Shandong, Hebei, Henan, and Jiangsu provinces have ordered 145,000 cubic meters of wood and 19,000 tons of scrap steel; cooperatives across the country expect to purchase about 90,000 tons of scrap steel by the first quarter of next year, which can be used by rural iron handicraft workers to manufacture agricultural implements.

This autumn, cooperatives in various regions have paid attention to organizing and developing local sources of goods, and cooperatives in most provinces across the country have held internal material exchange meetings. According to statistics from 19 regional material exchange meetings, the total turnover reached more than 700 billion yuan, of which handicrafts and local and special products accounted for more than 65 percent. At the material exchange meeting held by the East China District Office of the All-China Federation of Cooperatives, the total turnover reached 200 billion yuan, of which handicrafts and local and special products accounted for 99 percent. At the material exchange meetings held in Huairou, Fangshan, and Liangxiang counties in Hebei Province, grassroots cooperatives ordered and entrusted local handicraft workers and handicraft production cooperatives to process goods worth 1.6 billion yuan, all of which were agricultural implements and household utensils urgently needed by farmers, such as iron shovels, iron hooks, iron spades, grass sieves, and large pots. Some grassroots cooperatives conducted grain purchase work at the material exchange meetings they held. For example, in October, 18 grassroots cooperatives in Juye County, Shandong Province, held small-scale material exchange meetings at 48 locations, selling goods worth 36.86 million yuan and purchasing more than 78,500 jin of grain.

Experiences in various regions have proven that holding primary market material exchange meetings or handicraft product exhibitions below the county level is an effective way to meet the needs of farmers in a timely manner. The All-China Federation of Cooperatives called on cooperatives in various regions to universally hold primary market material exchange meetings. Cooperatives in some counties in Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, Zhejiang, Hebei, Hubei and other provinces have already held such meetings, and Jiangsu is actively preparing for them.

While vigorously developing local sources of goods, cooperatives in various regions are also actively cooperating with state-owned commercial enterprises to organize the supply of industrial products to the countryside. In the fourth quarter, commodities purchased by cooperatives in the Northeast District from state-owned companies accounted for 77.3 percent of the total retail sales, 67.5 percent in the North China District, and about 50 percent in East China, Central South, and Northwest China, with a national average of more than 60 percent. Most of these commodities allocated from state-owned commercial departments have been successively transported to rural areas.

The current problems in the work of preparing and supplying rural materials in the cooperative system are: First, the preparation of agricultural production materials in some areas is still insufficient; second, cooperatives in some areas do not pay enough attention to the operation of small agricultural implements. For example, the Xixiagezhuang Grassroots Cooperative in Laiyang County, Shandong Province, needs to purchase more than 4,800 small agricultural implements within six months in its business scope of 38 villages, but the cooperative only supplied 204 pieces. The cooperative is unwilling to operate car and horse rope sets, traction devices, etc.; third, cooperatives in some areas are still not active in operating handicrafts, resulting in out-of-stock phenomena for household utensils such as pots, bowls, basins, and spoons.

    全国各地合作社积极开辟货源
    配合购粮工作供应农民生产资料
     【本报讯】全国各地合作社配合粮食以及棉、麻、烟等工业原料的收购工作，大力供应农民生产资料。
    各地合作社秋收后着重进行了农业生产资料的供应工作。如河北省通县合作社第四季度准备的货物，农业生产资料占百分之三十五点二一；江苏省宝山县第四季度已准备的生产资料，总值达六十七亿元，较去年同期增加一点八倍。西北，内蒙古，山东、河北、山西、河南、热河、黑龙江等地的合作社，都开展了牲口调剂业务。据山东省二十六个县合作社的统计，秋收后帮农民调剂了五千余头牲口；陕西、甘肃、宁夏三省，据不完全的统计，合作社已供应农民三千四百余头牲口；山西省榆次县七个基层合作社在十月到十一月中旬分别召开的小型物资交流会上，帮农民调剂牲口一千三百一十一头。在农具供应方面，仅河南省郑州、许昌等六个专区的合作社，九月份即供应农民九千一百零五部水车、八千四百零六张步犁、十八万六千件小农具。
    目前，许多地区的合作社已对今冬、明春生产资料的供应工作积极进行了准备。如西北区合作社计划今冬、明春供应牲口六千一百头，大车、小车二千辆。山东省合作社计划供应的小农具总值达一千亿元。据关内十五个省、市的统计，供销合作社已准备饼肥四十三万吨；化学肥料，到明年第一季度末，约可供应十九万吨。为了供应明年春天农村制造农具和修建房屋等的需要，山东、河北、河南、江苏四省已订购木材十四万五千立方公尺、废钢铁一万九千吨；全国各地合作社预计到明年第一季度止要收购九万吨左右的废钢铁，可以供农村铁业手工业者用来制造农具。
    各地合作社今秋都注意了组织和开辟地方货源的工作，全国大部省份的合作社都召开了合作社内部的物资交流会。据十九个地区物资交流会的统计，成交总额达七千余亿元，其中手工业品和土产、特产品占百分之六十五强。全国合作总社华东区办事处召开的物资交流会上，成交总额达二千亿元，其中手工业品和土产、特产品占百分之九十九。河北省怀柔、房山、良乡等县召开的物资交流会上，基层合作社向当地手工业者和手工业生产合作社订货和委托加工的货物值十六亿元，都是农民迫切需要的铁锨、铁钩、铁铲、草筛、大锅等农具和家庭用具。有些基层合作社举行的物资交流会上进行购粮工作，如山东省钜野县十八个基层合作社十月份在四十八处举行了小型物资交流会，销出货物值三千六百八十六万元，收购粮食七万八千五百多斤。
    各地经验证明，召开县以下的初级市场物资交流会或手工业产品展览会，是及时满足农民需要的有效的方式。中华全国合作社联合总社曾号召各地合作社普遍召开初级市场物资交流会，山西、山东、河南、浙江、河北、湖北等省部分县的合作社已经召开，江苏各地正在积极筹备。
    各地合作社在大力开辟地方货源的同时，还积极配合国营商业组织工业品下乡。第四季度，东北区合作社由国营公司进货的商品，占零售总额的百分之七十七点三，华北区占百分之六十七点五，华东、中南、西北占百分之五十左右，全国平均占百分之六十以上，从国营商业部门调拨来的这些商品，大部已陆续运往农村。
    目前合作社系统准备和供应农村物资工作中存在的问题是：一、有些地区农业生产资料准备得还不充足；二、有些地区的合作社对经营小农具还不够重视，如山东省莱阳县西夏格庄基层合作社经营范围内的三十八个村，半年内需要添购小农具四千八百余件，而该社仅供应了二百零四件，车马绳套、輓具之类，该社就不愿经营；三、有些地区的合作社对于经营手工业品仍不积极，以致使锅、碗、盆、勺等家庭用具发生脱销现象。
