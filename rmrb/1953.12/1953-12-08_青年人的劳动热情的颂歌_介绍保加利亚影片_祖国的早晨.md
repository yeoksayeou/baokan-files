    The Bulgarian film "Morning of the Motherland" is a song of the youthful labor enthusiasm.
    The film portrays the high enthusiasm of Bulgarian youth in building their motherland in a simple and truthful manner. They enthusiastically sign up to participate in work teams, vying to contribute two months of voluntary labor to the socialist construction that is underway. Those who are approved are called "lucky ones," and they march towards the construction site amidst the cheers of the crowd. When a fitter wants to join the work team, the entire workshop takes on his production quota. Male and female work team members initiate competitions on the road, and at the construction site, they launch competitions for the Red Banner of Excellence. Cliffs and precipices yield under the swinging arms of the young people, roads are opened, and dams are built. They guarantee the engineers that after pouring the sluice gate foundation slab, they can also rush to build the temporary dam, ensuring that labor efficiency is increased to 200 percent. This labor enthusiasm reaches its climax when rushing to repair the temporary dam on a stormy night to prevent flash floods from destroying the construction site. The young people work intensely under the torrents of rain, with no one thinking about the danger of being submerged by the water. Hundreds of people move in unison like a giant. Young people have already transformed into warriors in labor, and their courage, perseverance, confidence, organization, and efficient operation all tell people that the builders will surely achieve victory. This is a magnificent ode to labor construction.
    The great Russian thinker Belinsky said it well: "To love one's motherland means to aspire for the motherland to become the embodiment of human ideals and to do one's best to promote this." A heart that loves the motherland will never passively be satisfied with the status quo, but it must be filled with the desire to make everything in the motherland even more perfect; and it must devote all its strength to achieve this goal. The images of the young men and women in the film are lovable. They engage in labor with such enthusiasm, joy, and concentration, and they understand the significance of the obligations they undertake with such certainty. To work well and work more for the motherland has become the dominant idea in their hearts. They sing: "Assault in time and space, turn a century into a year..."
    The film focuses on the progress of the young student Ivan Bobchev. When the Party called on young people to participate in voluntary labor work teams, he was focused on entering university to study medicine. He believed that intellectuals like himself should not waste time as "coolies," and that studying medicine could make a greater contribution to the country, which was a person's "future development." This reveals the contradiction between "expert thinking" and current work. This prevents him from enthusiastically rushing to the important construction projects like his companions. Later, he signed up out of spite. On the train, he was out of place with the other work team members. Everyone happily sang, but he was dressed impeccably, afraid of being squeezed, unable to stand the smell of a farmer youth's green onion under his nose, and unable to bear the coal smoke on his face. These stimulated him to decide to leave the team midway, almost getting off the train to go home. Arriving at the construction site, he initially could not endure the physical labor because he lacked the support of spiritual strength, and he appeared dejected. His group could not win the Red Banner because of his lagging behind. He inadvertently gets injured, and he is completely discouraged. He is sure that he is not suitable for this kind of life, and he comes up with a reason that some intellectuals often use, called "Don't let me burden the group" (as if he is unwilling to affect the collective, but in reality, he does not consider himself a useful member of the collective, and he is sure of his incompetence, without confidence in overcoming difficulties) and wants to go home again. These detailed descriptions of thoughts and actions are also true. But he has another side, namely the bright, upward, and transformable side. The film comprehensively grasps both aspects of Ivan's character very well. First, it describes that when Ivan decides not to participate in the work team himself, he is distressed. After arguing with his father, he goes out and wanders aimlessly on the street, seeing mobilization posters everywhere and hearing mobilization broadcasts. His friends have all gone, and he cannot help but feel embarrassed and lonely. Especially when the work team marches past the road singing loudly, even though he does not go, he feels the sadness of becoming an outsider. In fact, it is not that he is further away from everyone, but that the inner contradiction is deepened. It is precisely because of this that he signed up to participate out of spite. This unstable enthusiasm also made him want to quietly leave the team on the train and go home. Coincidentally, among the welcoming crowd at the station, there was an old lady wearing mourning clothes who gave him flowers, saying that he looked like her son who had sacrificed in the guerrilla team, and she wanted him to represent her son and participate well in the construction. Ivan saw for the first time how enthusiastic the people were about building their motherland and what high expectations they placed on them. He stayed.
    The film's description of Ivan's progress meticulously shows how the younger generation constantly grows under the Party's cordial care and education and the inspiration of the noble qualities of revolutionary martyrs. Young people have easily moved hearts, and we can often find the key to opening the door to a young person's progress in this regard. When Ivan wavered again after being injured, the captain's earnest conversation comforted and stabilized him. At night, each team calls the names of the sacrificed martyrs, and under the torchlight, they sing a tragic elegy: "You are the ones who truly walked the heroic and precious path!" Ivan was moved and tore up the letter he had written to apply to leave the team. These good factors and powerful influences enabled Ivan to persevere and finally get used to labor. It was not so difficult to swing a hammer and push a handcart. Labor has gradually become a conscious work. Even when special agents attempted to blow up the dam, a courage supported Ivan to jump into the water to rescue it without regard for his own safety.
    Young people can learn a lot from Ivan's story, thereby understanding that personal plans are the basic obstacle on the road to progress. When Ivan has such thoughts, he is distressed, lonely, and weak. He is also easily targeted by saboteurs for co-opting. And when he begins to wholeheartedly dedicate all his personal strength to the country, his mood is bright and upward, and he will live a happy and fulfilling life; he is surrounded by kind friends and comrades, he has no personal baggage, and he feels that he has strength and confidence. Ivan develops, progresses, and gradually becomes a new person with excellent moral qualities, most needed by the people under such circumstances. The greatest educational significance of the entire film for young people lies here. Especially as our country begins construction and needs young people to completely obey the needs of the national plan even more, it is very necessary to learn the enthusiasm of Bulgarian youth in building their motherland and to learn lessons from Ivan's progress.
    I would also like to mention another issue raised in the film. Imperialism and the remnants of domestic reactionaries will do everything possible to sabotage the economic construction of people's democratic countries. In the film, there are two special agents, George and Monka, who first sabotage the enthusiasm of young people to participate in voluntary labor, and then sneak into the construction site to provoke discord. Furthermore, they attempt to prevent the work team from reinforcing the temporary dam, conspiring to let flash floods destroy the entire project. When people risk their lives to rescue the dam project in the face of floods, they do not hesitate to light explosives. Adding such a plot to the film has great practical significance, reminding us to be highly vigilant and not forget to guard against the sabotage of class enemies in the enthusiasm of labor and the cheers of victory.
      "Morning of the Motherland" is a tempting and hopeful term. People will not forget the end of the film: a determined and heroic young labor army advances bathed in the glory of the morning sun. From every young person, from their neat steps, we hear the sound of Bulgaria advancing towards socialism by leaps and bounds. The planned construction of our beloved motherland has also begun, and the light of socialist industrialization is shining upon us. Our country's youth are marching towards construction posts with the same firm and heroic steps as the Bulgarian youth.

    青年人的劳动热情的颂歌
    ——介绍保加利亚影片“祖国的早晨”

    保加利亚影片“祖国的早晨”，是一首青年人的劳动热情的颂歌。
    影片朴素而真实地表现了保加利亚青年建设祖国的高度热情。他们踊跃报名参加工作队，争先恐后地要去为正在开始的社会主义建设作两个月的义务劳动。被批准的人被称做“幸运儿”，他们豪迈地在群众夹道欢呼中开向工地。一个钳工要参加工作队，全车间就负担他的生产定额。男女工作队员们在路上就发起了竞赛，在工地上，他们展开了优胜红旗的竞赛，悬崖绝壁在年青人的臂膀挥舞下屈服了，道路开成，堤坝筑起来了。他们向工程师担保浇完水闸基底板之后，还能赶好临时坝，保证把劳动效率提高到百分之二百。这种劳动热情在暴风雨之夜抢修临时坝，防止山洪冲毁工地时达到最高潮。青年们在雨的狂流下紧张地劳动，谁也没有想到自己可能被水淹没的危险。几百人像一个巨人一样地一致动作。青年人已经在劳动中变成了战士，他们的勇气、毅力、信心、组织性、有效率的操作都告诉人们建设者一定会得到胜利。这是对劳动建设的壮丽的颂歌。
    俄国伟大的思想家别林斯基说得好：“爱自己的祖国，这就是说，要渴望祖国能成为人类的理想的体现，并尽自己的力量来促进这点。”热爱祖国的心，绝不会消极地满足现状，它一定充满了要使祖国的一切更加完美的愿望；而且一定要为了实现这个目的，拿出自己全部的力量来。影片里男女青年的形象，是令人喜爱的。他们那样热诚、愉快、专心一致地从事劳动，他们那样肯定地理解自己所承担的义务的意义。为祖国工作得好，工作得更多，已成为他们心中的支配思想。他们唱着：“在时间与空间里突击，把一世纪变成一年。……”
    影片着重描写了青年学生伊凡·鲍勃契夫的进步过程。当党号召青年参加义务劳动工作队时，他正在一心想进大学去学医，他认为像自己这样的知识分子，不应该去当“苦力”浪费时间，学医可以给国家更大贡献，这才是一个人的“发展前途”。这里揭露了“专家思想”和当前工作的矛盾。这使他不能和同伴一样热情地奔向重要建设工程。后来他负气报名，在火车上和其他工作队员们格格不入，大家欢快高歌，他一个人却衣冠楚楚，怕挤，受不了一个农民青年伸到他鼻下的大葱的气味，受不了扑面的煤烟。这些刺激得他下决心中途离队，几乎下车回家。到了工地，他开头因为没有精神力量的支持，受不了体力劳动，显得垂头丧气，小组因为他的落后总争不到红旗。他不留神受伤，就完全灰心，肯定自己不适合这样生活，想出一种有些知识分子常会拿起的理由，叫做“不要因为我连累小组”（好像是不愿影响集体，实际是把自己不算做集体里有用的一员，而且肯定了自己的无能，对克服困难没有信心）而又想回家了。这些思想和行动的细致描写，也是真实的。但他有着另一面，即光明的、向上的、可改造的一面。影片很好的全面掌握了伊凡性格的两方面。首先描写了伊凡决定自己不参加工作队时，他是苦恼的。他和父亲吵嘴后出来，在马路上无目的地溜达，四处看到动员的招贴画，听到动员的广播。朋友们又都去了，他不能不感到难堪和孤独。特别是工作队高唱着走过马路时，他虽然不去，但又感受到自己成为局外人的难过。其实并不是他和大家距离更远，而是内心矛盾更加深了。正是由于这一点，他才能负气去报名参加。这种不巩固的热情，也就使得他曾经想从火车上悄悄离队回家。恰巧在车站上欢迎群众中，有一位穿丧服的老太太向他献了花，说他很像自己在游击队里牺牲了的儿子，要他代表她的儿子，好好地去参加建设。伊凡第一次看到人民对建设自己祖国的人是怎样热情和寄托着何等高的期望。他留下了。
    影片对伊凡进步过程的描写，细致地表现了年青一代怎样在党的亲切关怀教导和革命先烈崇高品质的感召下，不断地成长。青年人有着易受感动的心灵，我们经常能从这方面找到打开一个青年人进步之门的锁钥。当伊凡受伤后再次动摇的时候，队长恳切的谈话安慰和稳定了他。夜间各小队点名历数牺牲先烈的名字，在火炬照耀下唱起悲壮的挽歌：“你们才是真正走过英勇珍贵的道路啊！”伊凡被感动了，自己撕毁了写好了的声明离队的信。这些好的因素和有力的影响，使伊凡支持了下去，终于习惯了劳动，挥起铁锤，推起手车来都不是那么困难了。劳动已经逐渐成为自觉的工作。甚至当特务企图炸毁水坝时，就有一股勇气支持伊凡奋不顾身地跳下水去抢救。
    青年人可以从伊凡的故事里受到很多教育，从而懂得个人打算就是进步道路上的基本障碍。当伊凡有这样的思想时，他是苦恼的、孤独的、脆弱无力的。他也很容易成为破坏分子拉拢的对象。而当他开始全心全意为国家献出个人一切力量的时候，他的心情便是光明的、向上的，他会生活得愉快充实；他的周围都是亲切的朋友和同志，他没有个人包袱，感到自己有力量，有信心。伊凡就在这种情况下，得到发展，得到进步，逐渐成为具有优良道德品质，人民所最需要的新人。全部影片对青年最大的教育意义就在这里。特别是在我们国家开始建设，更加需要青年完全服从国家计划需要的时候，学习保加利亚青年这种建设祖国的热情，从伊凡的进步吸取教训，是很有必要的。
    我也要提起影片中提出的另一问题。帝国主义和国内反动派残余分子，对人民民主国家的经济建设，要千方百计地进行破坏。影片里有两个特务乔治和蒙卡，他们先是破坏青年们参加义务劳动的热情，而后就混进工地来挑拨离间。再则企图使工作队不去加固临时坝，阴谋让山洪冲毁全部工程。当人们不顾生命危险在洪水前抢救堤坝工程的时候，他们更不惜点起炸药。影片加进了这样的情节是有极大现实意义的，它提醒我们要有高度警惕，在劳动热情和胜利欢呼中，不能忘了防备阶级敌人的破坏。
      “祖国的早晨”，这是个诱惑人的充满了希望的名词。人们忘不了影片结尾：一支坚定的英勇的青年劳动大军浴着朝阳的光辉前进。从每一个青年身上，从他们整齐的步伐中，我们听到了保加利亚向着社会主义大踏步前进的声音。我们可爱的祖国有计划的建设也开始了，社会主义工业化的光芒正照耀着我们。我国的青年们，正迈着和保加利亚青年同样坚定豪迈的步子，走向建设岗位去。
