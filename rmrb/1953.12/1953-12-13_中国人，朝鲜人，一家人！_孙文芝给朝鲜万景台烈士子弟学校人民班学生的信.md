"Chinese, Koreans, One Family!"
—Sun Wenzhi's Letter to Students of the People's Class at the Mangyongdae Revolutionary School for the Children of Martyrs in Korea

Dear Students,

    I have received your letter. Needless to say, you must have already heard the good news when I write this letter. I can imagine your joyous and excited expressions. I want to tell you that we are just as happy as you are!

    The day before yesterday at noon, my eldest child came back from school and excitedly told me, "Mom, Uncle Kim Il-sung had a heart-to-heart talk with Chairman Mao in Beijing, and Chairman Mao also represented the people of the whole country, giving Korea a lot of money to help the Korean people with construction!"

    Dear students, the Sino-Korean Joint Communiqué has made me truly understand the full meaning of what you said in your letter: "Chinese *saram*, Korean *saram*, *kanjippang*!" (Chinese, Koreans, one family!)

    I remember one afternoon in September, I received a letter from Volunteer Army soldier Yang Wenzhun, who told me that in Korea, regardless of men, women, old, or young, when they saw the Volunteer Army, they always said, "Chinese *saram*, Korean *saram*, *kanjippang*!" To help me understand the meaning of this sentence, he also mentioned two stories in the letter. One was about a cook of a Volunteer Army unit, Comrade Min Gensheng, who rushed into the thick smoke and flames to rescue a Korean girl when American planes were frantically bombing a village, and used his own body to shield her. At that time, he thought, "The Chinese and Korean people are one family, the Korean girl is my little sister, and it is my responsibility to protect her!" Later, Comrade Min Gensheng was seriously injured, and bright red blood stained the girl's white clothes. The other story was about an old Korean man, Jiang Fengcheng, who took off his cotton-padded coat in the biting rain and snow to rescue Comrade Zhang Huihong, a communication soldier of a Volunteer Army unit.

    Dear students, from that day on, I often thought about the meaning of the sentence "Chinese *saram*, Korean *saram*, *kanjippang*." I often thought: Are you living well? Is your economic recovery progressing smoothly? Every day when I opened the newspaper, I would always look at the news about Korea first, to see how you were recovering construction, to see the reconstruction plans for Pyongyang..., which made me extremely excited. What made me most happy was the Sino-Korean Joint Communiqué and the Sino-Korean Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement, because they completely represented the hearts of the entire Chinese people! It expresses the iron-like determination of the people of China and Korea to be forever united and to fight to the end to defend the cause of peace; it expresses the full meaning of the sentence "Chinese *saram*, Korean *saram*, *kanjippang*."

    Dear students, I also often think that the Yalu River is not a dividing line that separates us, but a belt that tightly connects us. The friendship between the Chinese and Korean people is a flower of peace that has grown in the blood of our common battles. If the enemy of peace dares to stick out its pig snout, we will chop it off! I wish you good health!

                            Sun Wenzhi

    “中国人，朝鲜人，一家人！”
    ——孙文芝给朝鲜万景台烈士子弟学校人民班学生的信亲爱的同学们：
    你们的来信已经收到。当我写这封信时，不用说，好消息你们早已知道了。我能想像得到你们那种欢欣鼓舞的神情，我要告诉你们的，是我们也像你们一样，是多么高兴啊！
    前天中午，我的大孩子从学校一回来，就那么兴致勃勃地告诉我说：“妈妈，金日成伯伯在北京和毛主席谈了心，毛主席还代表全国人民，送给朝鲜很多钱，帮助朝鲜人民建设呢！”
    亲爱的同学们，中朝谈判公报使我真正体会到你们来信中所说的：“中国撒拉米，朝鲜撒拉米，阚吉棒！”（中国人，朝鲜人，一家人！）那句话的全部意义了。
    记得是在九月里的一天下午，我接到志愿军战士杨文俊同志的来信，他告诉我说，在朝鲜不论男女老幼，见到志愿军总要说：“中国撒拉米，朝鲜撒拉米，阚吉棒！”他为了使我能体会这句话的意义，在信中，还谈到这样两个故事。一个是说志愿军某部炊事员闵根生同志，在美国飞机疯狂轰炸一个村子时，他冲进浓烟烈火抢救一个朝鲜女孩子，并用自己的身体掩护了她。当时他想：“中朝人民是一家，朝鲜女孩子就是我的小妹妹，救护她是我的责任！”后来，闵根生同志负了重伤，殷红的鲜血染满了那个女孩子的白衣裳。另一个是说朝鲜老大爷姜凤城，在刺骨的雨雪中，脱下自己的棉袄，来救护志愿军某部通讯员张会红同志的动人事迹。
    亲爱的同学们，从那一天起，我就常常体会 “中国撒拉米，朝鲜撒拉米，阚吉棒”这句话的意义。我常常想：你们生活得好吗？你们恢复经济建设进行得顺利吗？每天翻开报纸，我总要先看关于朝鲜的消息，看你们恢复建设的情形，看恢复平壤的建设计划……，这都使我异常兴奋。而使我最高兴的，是这次中朝两国的谈判公报和中朝经济及文化合作协定，因为这完完全全代表了全中国人民的心意呀！它表达了中朝两国人民永远团结得紧紧的，为保卫和平事业奋斗到底的钢铁般的决心；它表达了“中国撒拉米，朝鲜撒拉米，阚吉棒”这句话的全部意义。
    亲爱的同学们，我还常常想，鸭绿江水并不是把我们分开的界限，而是把我们紧紧连在一起的带子，中朝两国人民的友谊，是在共同战斗的血泊中成长起来的和平鲜花。和平的敌人，敢于伸出它的猪嘴来，我们就砍掉它！祝你们健康！
                            孙文芝
                          十一月二十八日于上海
