    A State-Owned Department Store Wholesale Shop Closely Connected with Rural Cooperatives
    Chen Jiyun

    The entire staff of the China Department Store Liaoxi Province Lishu County Company Wholesale Shop, due to their understanding of the significant importance of coordinating with grain purchases and their clear understanding that only by relying on cooperatives can rural needs be met, studied the experience of Sun Fangzhi of the China Department Store Fengcheng County Company in connecting with cooperatives in early October, thereby strengthening their ties with cooperatives. They first realized that the difficulty for cooperative purchasing agents was "running to seven different places on the street"—grain, coal and construction, specialized products, and department stores companies, plus running to the county cooperative, banks, and tax bureaus, and therefore proposed the slogan: "Do everything possible to provide convenience to cooperatives." Sell to cooperatives whenever they come. Once, the Xiaochengzi Cooperative in the Sixth District came to the store to buy goods at 9 p.m. Although the store was already closed, salesperson Pan Fengyi warmly welcomed them, patiently introducing the merchandise, and the cooperative purchased over 14 million yuan worth of goods. Now, when cooperative purchasing agents come, they hand the order to the store and go to take care of other matters. When they come to pick up the goods in the afternoon, the store has already written out the receipts, packaged the goods, and even helped load them onto the vehicle, allowing them to return to the cooperative the same day. If they cannot return on the same day, the store provides them with accommodation. As a result, the cooperative purchasing agents are very satisfied.

    Not only that, but the store staff also goes deep into the cooperatives to understand sales and inventory situations, helping to solve the problem of overstocking. For example, the store director went to the Liushuyingzi Cooperative and saw that the cooperative had a large amount of unsalable goods such as Jishi and Koudeyi toothpaste, wooden mirrors, white thread gloves, pillow towels, monosodium glutamate, and various blue cloths. He tried to transfer these goods to cooperatives in the city; he also transferred unsalable goods such as ping-pong balls and rackets from the Fourth Village Cooperative in the Ninth District to other units. As a result, the director of the Liushuyingzi Cooperative said: "This time, we have less capital tied up, so we can buy more salable goods." He then went to the wholesale shop to buy 53 bolts of striped, blue, and white cloth, more than 40 types of rural salable goods such as dog skin hats and cotton-soled shoes, totaling more than 25 million yuan.

    Some of the store's sales staff are very enthusiastic and go to help city cooperatives sell goods on their days off or when business is not busy. This not only increased the cooperative's turnover but also expanded the cooperative's range of products. For example, Pan Fengyi and Lu Fengxiang went to help the central cooperative sell goods on their days off. They found that the cooperative only had three pairs of single rubber shoes with incomplete sizes. At the time, customers wanted to buy them, but none of them fit. Lu Fengxiang asked the cooperative salesperson to get six pairs of sneakers and six pairs of long five-eye rubber shoes from the wholesale store, which sold out that day. The next day, the cooperative took another two and a half dozen rubber shoes. Thanks to Lu Fengxiang's help, the cooperative added more than 30 types of seasonal goods, and the sales of department store items also increased from 1 million yuan per day in the past to an average of more than 3 million yuan per day. In addition, they also helped them establish a counter registration system, recording all the goods that the villagers needed but the cooperative did not have in a notebook. The goods recorded on the same day were used to help them make plans that evening, and they were stocked the next day. These practical examples also educated the cooperatives, as Director Wang of the central cooperative said: "The store mobilized us to get winter goods, and I always thought it was too early, that the time hadn't come yet, but now I know."

    In the past, the store only took care of urban cooperatives in the allocation of goods, so rural cooperatives could not get to manage some of the smaller quantities of goods. Since the fourth quarter, the store staff has realized the significant importance of meeting the needs of the rural areas after the harvest and changed the past distribution method to "satisfy rural cooperatives as much as possible with goods suitable for rural areas," and rural cooperatives have generally praised this. For example, once the store received a batch of "Fengnianle" white cloth, which rural cooperatives all needed. Although the quantity was not large, the store still left one piece for each rural cooperative to meet their needs.

    In addition to sending a commodity catalog to grassroots cooperatives every half a month, the Lishu County State-Owned Department Store also cut cloth into strips and pasted them into samples, which were sent to grassroots cooperatives as a reference for purchasing goods. It also established communication relationships with salespersons from many key cooperatives to understand the needs of farmers at any time.

    Because of this, the store's turnover has gradually increased, exceeding the October sales plan by 10.2 percent (calculated according to 40 percent of the quarterly plan), the relationship between state-owned stores and cooperatives has been further strengthened, and the supply of the rural market has been met. Now, all the store's staff are working hard with full confidence to ensure the over-fulfillment of the fourth-quarter plan.

    一个密切联系农村合作社的国营百货批发商店
    陈际云
    中国百货公司辽西省梨树县公司批发商店的全体职工，由于认识了配合购粮的重大意义，明确地认识了只有依靠合作社才能满足农村需要，在十月初学习了中国百货公司凤城县公司孙芳芝联系合作社的经验，密切了与合作社的联系。他们首先体会到合作社采购员的困难是上街七处跑——跑粮食、煤建、专卖、百货公司，再加上跑县社、银行、税务局，因而提出：尽一切可能给合作社以方便的口号。合作社什么时候来、就什么时候卖。有一次六区小城子社晚九点来商店买货，虽然商店早已下班，但营业员潘凤义还是热心招待，耐心介绍商品，合作社买去了一千四百多万元商品。现在合作社采购员来时，把买货单交给商店后，就去办其他的事，午后来取货时，商店早已把票开好、货包装好，还帮助装好车，就能当天返回合作社。如果当天不能回去，商店就招待他们住宿。因而合作社采购员都很满意。
    不仅如此，商店工作人员还深入合作社了解销、存情况，帮助解决积压问题。如商店主任到柳树营子合作社看到该社积压着吉士和口得意牙膏、木板镜子、白线手套、枕巾、味素以及各种青布等不少不适销的商品，就设法调剂给城内合作社；又把九区四村合作社积压的根本不能卖的乒乓球、球拍等商品调剂给别的单位。因而柳树营子合作社主任说：“这回我们资金占压少了，可以多买些适销商品。”当时就到批发商店买去条格、青、白布五十三匹，狗皮帽子、棉胶鞋等四十余种，总值二千五百多万元的农村适销商品。
    商店内有的营业员很热情，在休息日或营业不忙时，去帮助城内合作社卖货，这样既增加了合作社的营业额，又扩大了合作社的经营品种。如潘凤义、卢凤祥在自己休息日去帮助中心合作社卖货，发现该社只有三双号码不全的单胶鞋，当时正有顾客要买，都不合脚，卢凤祥就叫该社营业员到批发商店去取来球鞋六双、长五眼胶鞋六双，当天就卖光。第二天该社又拿去了二打半胶鞋。由于卢凤祥的帮助，该社新增加适季商品三十余种，百货类卖钱额亦由过去每天卖一百万元提高到每天平均卖三百余万元。此外还帮助他们建立了柜台登记制度，把老乡需要而合作社没有的商品都记在本子上，当天记下的商品，当晚就帮助他们作计划，第二天就进了货。通过这些实际例子，也教育了合作社，正如中心社王主任说：“商店动员我们取冬货，我老认为早呢，还没到时候，这回可知道了。”
    商店在商品分配上，过去只照顾城市合作社，因而有些数量较少的商品乡村社就摊不着经营。自第四季度以来，商店职工认识到满足丰收后农村的需要的重大意义，改变过去的分配方法为“适合农村的尽量满足农村社”，因而农村合作社普遍称好。像有一次商店来了一批“丰年乐”白布，农村合作社都需要，虽然来的数量不多，商店还是给每个农村合作社留一件，满足了他们的需要。
    梨树县国营百货商店除了半月发送一次商品目录到基层社外，还用布截成条贴成样本，发给基层合作社作为进货参考，并与不少重点合作社营业员建立了通讯关系，随时了解农民需要情况。
    正因为这样，商店营业额逐渐上升，超额完成十月份推销计划百分之十点二（按季度计划百分之四十计算），国营商店和合作社的关系进一步密切，农村市场供应得以满足。现在商店全体职工正满怀信心地为保证超额完成第四季度计划而努力。
