    Romanenko, the leader of the Soviet experts working at Anshan Iron and Steel Company, spoke at the inauguration ceremony of the large rolling mill, seamless steel tube plant, and No. 7 blast furnace. He said: On behalf of the Soviet experts working at Anshan Iron and Steel Company, I congratulate the Chinese comrades on the completion and commencement of production of the large rolling mill, seamless steel tube plant, No. 7 blast furnace, and coke ovens Nos. 15 and 16. The completion and commencement of production of these projects is a huge contribution to the cause of national industrialization of the People's Republic of China. Thanks to the workers' enthusiasm for labor, this huge construction project has been completed in a tight timeframe. The workers in the production departments have smoothly mastered the production. The workers in the newly opened units have contributed thousands of tons of pig iron, seamless steel tubes, steel rails, and high-quality steel billets to their country. This fact is only possible in New China, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government. We, the Soviet experts sent by the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government, thank the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and the Chinese workers and their leaders for creating favorable conditions for our technical assistance work. We will do our best and use all our knowledge to make this assistance as effective as possible. We sincerely congratulate the workers and leaders of Anshan Iron and Steel Company on completing the restoration and reconstruction of Anshan Iron and Steel Company and mastering all production capacity within the period stipulated by the Central People's Government. Let us consolidate and develop the unbreakable friendship between the people of our two great nations, China and the Soviet Union.
