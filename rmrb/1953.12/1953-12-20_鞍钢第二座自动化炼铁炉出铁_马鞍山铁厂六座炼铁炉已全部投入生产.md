    Anshan Iron and Steel's Second Automated Blast Furnace Produces Iron
    All Six Blast Furnaces at Ma'anshan Iron Plant Are Now in Production
   [This Newspaper's News] The second automated and largest blast furnace in China, rebuilt by Anshan Iron and Steel Company, was completed thirteen days ahead of schedule. At 3:30 PM on December 18th, a signing ceremony was held to hand over the blast furnace to the production department. Ignition for iron smelting began at 7:30 PM that evening, and the first batch of molten iron was successfully smelted at 8:30 PM on the evening of the 19th.
    At 7:30 PM on the evening of the 18th, the eagerly awaited moment of ignition arrived. Leaders of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Soviet experts who directly participated in the construction of this blast furnace, and visiting crowds came to the newly born blast furnace with joy. Under the direction of Zhou Chuandian, Deputy Director of the Anshan Iron and Steel Ironmaking Plant, preparations for igniting the blast furnace were quickly completed. When Hua Ming, Acting General Manager of Anshan Iron and Steel, pressed a button next to the hot blast stove, the hot blast valve of the hot blast stove automatically opened, and hot air at 650 degrees Celsius poured into the blast furnace through a black pipe two meters in diameter, and the coke at the bottom of the furnace burned violently. Ironworkers and technicians accurately grasped the melting situation of the ore in the furnace, adding raw materials in a timely manner, striving to smoothly smelt the first batch of molten iron.
    At 8:30 PM on the evening of the 19th, Zhou Chuandian, Deputy Director of the Anshan Iron and Steel Ironmaking Plant, announced that the iron tapping time had arrived. Furnace technician Zhang Diange led the furnace workers to open the taphole. In an instant, red-hot molten iron roared out of the taphole, flowing into the large iron can along the iron ditch. The visiting crowd cheered, celebrating this new victory. From now on, this newly produced blast furnace will produce molten iron with a value approximately equal to the daily production value of 90,000 farmers, continuously supplying iron foundries across the country with pig iron to manufacture a large number of production tools and supplies. According to Xinhua News Agency: All six small blast furnaces recently rebuilt by the state-owned Ma'anshan Iron Plant have been put into production. Among them, blast furnaces No. 1, 2, 3, and 4 produced iron before December; blast furnaces No. 5 and 6 were also put into production on December 11th and 15th, respectively. Thus, Ma'anshan Iron Plant has crossed its historical stage and joined the ranks of the motherland's economic construction with vigor. In the future, Ma'anshan Iron Plant will supply Shanghai and East China with a large amount of pig iron. Ma'anshan Iron Plant received strong support from fraternal factories and mines across the country in the blast furnace reconstruction project. As early as August of this year, Shijingshan, Taiyuan, Benxi, Daye, Longyan, and Yangquan and other factories and mines sent smelting technicians and skilled workers to help build the No. 2 blast furnace, which started construction earlier. When the reconstruction project entered a tense construction phase in October, these fraternal factories and mines sent a second batch of technical personnel to provide assistance. These smelting technicians and skilled workers have also trained a group of new technical workers in the past few months since officially entering production, enabling the six blast furnaces to be put into production quickly.
    The reconstruction project of the blast furnaces at Ma'anshan Iron Plant was designed by Chinese designers under the guidance of advanced Soviet design ideas. Therefore, the production of the several blast furnaces that were put into production earlier has been very smooth, and the output of pig iron has greatly exceeded the design output standards of the puppet regime period, and the quality also meets the standards.

    鞍钢第二座自动化炼铁炉出铁
    马鞍山铁厂六座炼铁炉已全部投入生产
   【本报讯】鞍山钢铁公司改建的我国第二座自动化的最大的炼铁炉，已提前十三天竣工。十二月十八日下午三时三十分举行了炼铁炉竣工移交生产部门的签字仪式，当天晚间七时三十分开始点火炼铁，并在十九日晚八时三十分胜利地熔炼出第一炉铁水。
    十八日晚七时三十分，人们热切地盼望着的点火炼铁的时刻来到了，鞍山钢铁公司负责人、直接参加这座炼铁炉建设的苏联专家和参观的人群，欢欣地来到这座新诞生的炼铁炉旁。在鞍钢炼铁厂副厂长周传典的指挥下，炼铁炉的点火准备工作很快地就做好了。当鞍钢代总经理华明走到了热风炉旁边一按电钮，热风炉的热风开闭器就自动打开，六百五十度的热风从两公尺直径的黑色管道涌进了炼铁炉，炉底的焦炭剧烈地燃烧起来了。炼铁工人和技术人员们，准确地掌握着炉内矿石熔化的情况，适时地往炉内添加原料，争取顺利地熔炼出第一炉铁水。
    十九日晚上八时三十分，鞍钢炼铁厂副厂长周传典宣布出铁的时间已到，炉前技师张殿阁率领炉前工人打开了出铁口，霎那间，通红的铁水吼叫着从出铁口冲出来，顺着铁沟滚滚地流入大铁罐。参观的人群欢呼起来，庆祝这一个新的胜利。从此，这座新产生的炼铁炉每天将吐出价值约等于九万个农民一天生产价值的铁水，源源不断大量地供应全国的铁工厂以翻砂铁，制造大批生产工具和用品。据新华社讯：国营马鞍山铁厂最近改建完成的六座小型炼铁炉，已全部投入生产。其中，第一、第二、第三、第四号炼铁炉先后在十二月份以前出铁；第五和第六号炼铁炉也在十二月十一、十五日先后投入生产。至此，马鞍山铁厂跨过了它的历史阶梯，以矫健的姿态投入祖国经济建设的行列。今后马鞍山铁厂将以大量的生铁，源源供应上海和华东各地。马鞍山铁厂在改建炼铁炉工程中，得到了全国各兄弟厂矿的大力支援。早在今年八月，石景山、太原、本溪、大冶、龙烟和阳泉等厂矿，就派出冶炼技术人员和熟练工人，前来帮助修建开工较早的二号炼铁炉。到十月份，改建工程进入紧张施工阶段时，这些兄弟厂矿又派出第二批技术力量，前来援助。这些冶炼技术人员和熟练工人，在正式投入生产的几个月中，又培养了一批新的技术工人，因此使六座炼铁炉能够迅速地投入生产。
    马鞍山铁厂炼铁炉的改建工程，是在苏联先进设计思想的指导下，由我国设计人员设计的。因此，投入生产较早的几座炼铁炉，生产很顺利，生铁的产量大大超过日伪时期设计产量的标准，质量也都合乎标准。
