State-owned grain departments in Jianyang, Nanping, Yong'an and other districts in northern and western Fujian Province, where mountains overlap, have found that in many places, due to traffic congestion, farmers have difficulty selling their surplus grain, making it impossible to improve farmers' lives. Recently, the state-owned grain departments in these districts have set up many grain purchasing stations in areas with the most "dead-end grain" and "difficult-to-transport grain," vigorously launching the late rice purchasing work. At the same time, relevant departments are building roads and opening up shipping lines in mountainous areas to break through the blockade of high mountains and dangerous waters and transfer the purchased grain. In addition, various localities have also repaired many collapsed mountain roads and bridges, organizing the masses to carry grain by shoulder and using wheelbarrows and other means of transportation. In Ninghua County, Yong'an District, where there used to be the most "dead-end grain," the state-owned grain department has set up ten purchasing stations to carry out purchases this year.

    福建省国营粮食部门深入山区收购粮食
    福建省北部和西部建阳、南平、永安等专区山岭重叠，有不少地方因交通阻塞，农民有很多余粮出售不便，农民生活无法改善。最近这几个专区的国营粮食部门在“死角粮”、“难运粮”最多的地区设立了许多购粮站，大力展开了晚稻收购工作。同时，有关部门在山区修筑道路、开辟航运线，冲破高山恶水的封锁，把收购的粮食调运出来。此外各地还修复很多倒塌了的山路和桥梁，组织群众肩挑和利用独轮车等运输工具运粮。过去“死角粮”最多的永安专区宁化县，今年国营粮食部门在那里设立了十个购粮站进行收购。（据新华社讯）
