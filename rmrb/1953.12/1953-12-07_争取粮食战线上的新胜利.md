Strive for New Victories on the Grain Front
Zhang Ying

I

Before liberation, due to the long-term reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, China's grain situation was in an extremely unreasonable state. On the one hand, the landlord and comprador class monopolized, plundered, and hoarded large quantities of grain as a tool for extravagant desires and rolling profits, which, combined with the malignant inflation of the reactionary rule, stirred up trouble in the market and became one of the main factors in price fluctuations. Therefore, in the producing areas, farmers suffered heavy exploitation and plunder, and although they produced grain, they themselves were hungry or semi-starved. In the selling areas, due to the daily increase in grain prices, the ratio of salaries and wages to goods for the people, especially the working class and lower-middle-class public employees, decreased daily, and people were anxious all day long for grain and other necessities of life; people in disaster areas could not get relief. In addition, the long-term feudal separatism, coupled with the inability to centrally dispatch and mutually assist the country in grain management, further exacerbated the imbalance between grain production and consumption in China. This turned China, originally a grain-producing country, into a country that imported large quantities of grain, thus deepening the colonial nature of China's economy. On the other hand, the reactionary rulers did not pay attention to water conservancy construction, and even destroyed water conservancy facilities in large quantities; they did not pay attention to the promotion of agricultural technology and science, and adopted a policy of destroying and undermining agricultural production; they adopted a policy of levying heavy taxes and plundering the countryside, expanding the scissors difference between industrial and agricultural products. Therefore, various disasters expanded year after year, production deteriorated, and productivity was severely damaged (grain production in the year of liberation was only about 74.6% of the highest annual output before liberation). In addition, the destruction of various animal husbandry and sideline industries in rural areas put the rural economy in a state of bankruptcy. Thus, the grain problem, one of the key problems in the economic life of the Chinese people, had not been solved for a long time before liberation.

Since liberation, thanks to the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government in carrying out the great land reform, and implementing and carrying out the correct policies on agricultural production, water conservancy construction, agricultural loans, agricultural tax collection, and grain management, the unreasonable grain situation that had existed in China for a long time in history has been fundamentally changed in just three or four years: First, grain production has recovered and exceeded the highest annual output level before liberation. The output in 1952 increased by 45% compared with 1949, and exceeded the highest annual output before liberation by about 17%; Second, the national grain dispatch was coordinated. Due to the government's vigorous and regular transportation work, the amount of unscheduled commodity grain (so-called "difficult-to-transport grain" and "dead-end grain") has decreased year by year; Third, the state controls about 85% of the social commodity grain through agricultural tax collection and market purchases, thereby strengthening the material foundation of the state in finance, finance, and the market. Therefore, it has guaranteed the supply of the market and national defense, supported the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and national construction; cracked down on speculation and stabilized grain and commodity prices; developed the socialist commercial front; cooperated with rural production and disaster relief, and gradually improved people's lives. It has also stopped the unfavorable situation of China's long-term grain imports, and on the basis of unified dispatch and increased production, it has a certain amount of necessary exports. The Chinese people have already won great victories on the grain front.

However, it must be pointed out that if we believe that the unreasonable grain situation before liberation has been changed and improved, and grain production has recovered and exceeded the pre-war level, and therefore we can be satisfied with this situation, satisfied with this level, and think that China's grain problem has been completely and finally solved, that is a serious mistake. The task before us is to fully familiarize ourselves with affairs in the grain sector, understand the relationship between grain issues and national construction, understand the current state of the grain economy, grasp its development trends, and, through a series of struggles and efforts, push the victories on the grain front from the recovery period to the construction period.

II

In the past three or four years, many changes have taken place in China's grain production and sales situation. First of all, since the lives of the majority of farmers have been initially improved, the consumption of grain has increased significantly, and the amount of grain stored by many farmers who are not in a hurry to sell has increased. According to typical surveys and statistics in some areas, about 60% of farmers have changed their lives of "half a year of chaff and vegetables" in the past, and can now maintain a level of eating enough. About 20% of farmers can not only eat enough, but also start to demand to eat better (for example, some farmers eat a lot of flour and fine grains, and eat less coarse grains), and have a considerable amount of surplus grain stored. In some places, surplus grain households account for more than 40%. In addition, there are still about 10% of farmers whose lives have improved compared with before liberation, but they still lack grain for several months each year. However, on the other hand, since agricultural production is still basically carried out on a decentralized individual basis using old agricultural tools, coupled with China's vast territory, undeveloped transportation, and uneven land wealth, the speed of grain production growth, especially the speed of commodity grain growth, cannot keep up with the speed of consumption growth; there is still an imbalance between production and consumption.

Secondly, with the development of China's industrial construction, the urban population and industrial population have gradually increased, and the industrial raw material crops, animal husbandry, brewing, food, oil and other industries have also gradually developed, which directly and indirectly increased the need for commodity grain. However, the expansion of our arable land area and the growth rate of commodity grain production are slow, and cannot keep up with the needs. Although the existing grain production and sales are balanced and have a certain surplus, this situation of unadapted development will become more and more obvious before the realization of agricultural collectivization.

According to the statistics of the Central Ministry of Agriculture, if the total grain output in 1950-1951 and the total grain output converted from potatoes are each 100, then the grain output in 1951-1952 is 109.37, the grain output converted from potatoes is 119.47, and the grain output in 1952-1953 is 130.5, and the grain output converted from potatoes is 172.1%. This shows that the total grain output is increasing year by year. However, what about the situation of commodity grain? The absolute number of commodity grain has also been increasing in recent years. For example, the commodity grain in this grain year is about 7.93% higher than the previous year, but the demand has increased by 25.19%, which is obviously faster than the growth rate of commodity grain production.

These situations collectively illustrate the changes in China's grain in recent years, and illustrate the fundamental relationship between China's agricultural economy and industrial economy. Comrade Stalin pointed out in the section on the grain problem in his article "On the Industrialization of the Country and the Right Deviation in the C.P.S.U.(B.)" in November 1928: "Only when the ordinary backwardness of the rural economy compared with industry becomes the excessive backwardness of the development of the rural economy, does the problem of the rural economy, especially the grain problem, appear on the stage." Obviously, the current situation of China's rural economy, especially the grain economy, has not yet reached this stage of "excessive backwardness," but judging from the current situation, this phenomenon will also appear in China. Our task is to accept the Soviet experience, foresee this, and put forward active methods to prevent and overcome it as soon as possible, so as to make the development of the grain economy gradually catch up with the development of the industrial economy as much as possible. Comrade Stalin also said: "In this case, our task is not to reduce the speed of industrial development to the level of the speed of grain economy development (this is reversing right and wrong and will make development regress), but to make the grain economy catch up with the speed of industrial development, and to increase the speed of grain economy development to the level that guarantees the rapid development of the national economy, industry and agriculture. If we solve this task, then the grain problem will be solved accordingly. If we do not solve this task, then a rupture between the socialist city and the small-farmer countryside will inevitably occur...This is the essence of the grain problem." Here, Comrade Stalin elevated the grain problem to the level of guaranteeing the development of the national economy, industry, and agriculture, and pointed out that the essence of the grain problem is the problem of urban-rural relations, that is, the problem of the worker-peasant alliance. Therefore, consolidating the victory on the grain front, and prudently and properly arranging and solving the grain problem step by step with foresight, is presented to the whole party as a political task.

III

So, how should we solve China's grain problem in order to ensure the smooth progress of national industrialization?

The most fundamental way is to increase grain production, which is the primary task on the agricultural production front. Comrade Stalin said in the "Political Report and Conclusion of the Central Committee at the 16th Congress of the C.P.S.U.(B.)": "The following agricultural problems are placed before us: (1) The problem of consolidating the position of technical crops by guaranteeing a sufficient amount of cheap grain products in those areas. (2) The problem of improving animal husbandry and solving the meat problem by ensuring sufficient grain products and feed in those areas. (3) Thoroughly solve the grain problem, which is the main problem in agriculture now. Thus, the grain problem is the basic problem in agriculture, and is the key to solving all other problems." In order to improve the lives of farmers and increase their purchasing power, and to ensure that the state meets its needs for grain and industrial raw materials, it is necessary to greatly increase agricultural production. Industrial raw material crops, such as cotton, soybeans, sugar cane, and tobacco, should gradually increase production in proportion to the development of industry, but the most important thing is to increase grain production. Therefore, the basic task of rural work is to develop agricultural production, and increasing grain production should be placed in the first place in agricultural production. If we can attach great importance to the increase in grain production, and make the annual output reach about 1,000 jin per capita, then China's grain problem will be fundamentally solved initially. After the October Revolution, Lenin put forward the goal of striving for an annual output of 8 billion poods (about 260 billion jin in China) for grain production in the Soviet Union, which means that it is required to reach an average consumption of more than 1,200 jin per person per year. We hope that after two five-year plans or a little more time, China will strive to reach a production level of 550 billion to 600 billion jin of raw grain per year.

It is extremely harmful to have insufficient understanding of the long-term nature of solving the grain problem in China's industrial construction, as well as the ideological emotions and practices of paralysis, relaxation, and complacent waiting for success in the future grain problem. It is easy to develop a tendency of laissez-faire, which is enough to harm our future and make us commit serious political mistakes. But at the same time, it should be pointed out that it is also wrong to take any negative and lamenting attitude towards China's grain problem. Because this does not understand that China's existing grain situation is enough to eat and use, and there is a certain surplus, which lays the material foundation for gradually fundamentally solving the grain problem. Because this ignores the objective possibility that the development of China's agricultural production and grain production can gradually and steadily follow the development of industrial production, so it can gradually solve the problem of unadapted development between the two. Because this does not understand that at present, the state can support and develop agriculture through agricultural organs and cooperatives from seed selection, agricultural science and technology, loans, and rewarding models, and exchange their support for the state through this support, provide the state with more commodity grain, and develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement on the basis of this support, and even transition to collectivization and mechanization in the future. Most importantly, with the strength and experience of the Party and the people in overcoming difficulties and overcoming difficulties for a long time, with the Party's rich experience in the struggle on the grain front, with the Party's wise and correct leadership, with the continuous improvement of the people's level of awareness and organization, and with the advanced experience of Soviet construction, we believe that after arduous efforts, China's grain problem will inevitably be solved.

IV

Since the ultimate solution to the grain problem is long-term, strengthening and improving the purchase of commodity grain has become particularly important while gradually increasing grain production.

Ensuring the full purchase of grain is the main means for us to control grain. During the grain purchase season, it is necessary to ensure the full supply of living materials and means of production with sufficient quantity and appropriate prices to the rural areas (here, handicrafts occupy an important position), so as to exchange as much surplus grain as possible (the purchase of other industrial raw material crops should also be the same). In the industrial raw material crop areas, farmers will buy more grain because they cannot buy enough industrial products, which fuels the psychology of speculation and hoarding of grain. Comrade Mikoyan pointed out in his speech on the first five-year plan at the 15th Congress of the C.P.S.U.(B.) in December 1927: "Decisive measures must be taken to purchase grain. In order to obtain grain from farmers, it is necessary to transfer goods from the city to the countryside, and even temporarily make the urban market completely out of stock." This is enough to illustrate the significance of fully supplying the industrial products needed by agriculture for purchasing grain.

At the same time, the management of the grain market should be strengthened, the speculative activities of illegitimate private merchants should be banned, and the normal purchase of grain should be guaranteed, so that the state can purchase enough commodity grain.

Cooperatives play a particularly important role in purchasing grain, supplying industrial products to rural areas, and other measures. State-owned (grain) businesses must rely on cooperatives to establish close supply and marketing relationships with farmers. Cooperatives at all levels should regard grain purchase as a political task, and sign various supply and marketing, pre-purchase, and deposit combination contracts with farmers through the supply of fertilizers, the supply of agricultural tools, and the supply of daily necessities.

Party and government organs at all levels should strengthen the leadership of grain purchase work, make unified arrangements, strengthen patriotic education for farmers, strengthen the education of the general line, mobilize party members to take the lead in calling on farmers to sell surplus grain to the state through rural party organizations. Judging from the recent examples of farmers actively selling grain to the state, there is full confidence in completing the grain purchase task.

In order to ensure that the purchased grain can guarantee the needs of the market, it is necessary to attach great importance to organizing correct supply, transportation, and storage work. Supply should be organized in a planned, controlled, and focused manner to ensure the grain needs of cities, industrial and mining areas, economic crop areas, and disaster areas. To this end, the planning of transportation work should be strengthened, and efforts should be made to improve the shortcomings of the past grain transportation being forced to concentrate in a few months, and often concentrated in the season when grain is needed for transportation. Dead-end grain and difficult-to-transport grain should be transported out as much as possible, so that things can be used to their full potential. The small warehouse system that seriously affected grain transportation in the past must be resolutely changed. In addition, transportation, escort, and handover and other tasks must be properly organized, and the mutual connection and coordination between them must be improved. Establish a practical and feasible transportation system.

In order to ensure the smooth progress of national construction and cope with unexpected events, the number of grain reserves must be increased, and a five-year reserve target must be set, distributed on the reserve line designated by the state.

In addition, it is necessary to use correct price policies to guide consumption, balance varieties, reward the planting of high-yielding crops, save grain, reduce unnecessary waste, appropriately limit the consumption of brewing, fertilizer, and feeding, and promote the use of other supplies.

Grain is a commodity that is related to the interests of the Chinese people, and is one of the important material foundations of the worker-peasant alliance. The grain problem is directly related to national economic construction, and the whole party and all cadres must be made deeply aware of the development trend of the grain problem as soon as possible, understand the grain situation, and understand the basic tasks and basic policies of grain work. Lead the people of the whole country to fight for improving the future grain situation and for winning new victories on the grain front.

    争取粮食战线上的新胜利
    张莹
    一
    解放前，由于国民党的长期反动统治，使中国过去的粮食情况处于极不合理的状态。一方面，地主、买办阶级垄断搜刮和囤积大批粮食作为穷奢极欲和滚利盘剥的工具，它与反动统治的恶性通货膨胀一结合，就在市场上兴风作浪，成为物价波动的主要因素之一。因此，在产地，农民由于遭受苛重的剥削和掠夺，虽然生产了粮食，但自己还是饿着肚皮，处于饥饿与半饥饿的状态。在销地，由于粮价逐日看涨，人民群众特别是工人阶级，中下层公教人员的薪金工资与实物的比率逐日下降，人们终日为粮食及其他的生活必需资料而焦虑；灾区人民更得不到救济。再加上长期封建割据，在粮食管理上全国粮食不能统筹调度和相互周济，促使中国粮食生产与消费不平衡的形势更加恶化。使中国本是一个粮食出产国家变为一个输入大量粮食的国家，因而加深了中国经济的殖民地性质。另一方面，反动统治者不重视水利建设，甚至大量地破坏水利设备；不重视农业技术科学的推广，对农业生产采取了摧残与破坏的政策；对农村采取了横征暴敛，掠夺搜刮，扩大工农业产品剪刀差的政策，因此，各种灾害连年扩大，生产每况愈下，生产力受到严重破坏，（到解放这一年，粮食生产只及解放前最高年产量的百分之七十四点六。）加上农村各种畜牧副业的破坏，农村经济处于一种破产状态。这样，作为中国人民经济生活中的关键问题之一的粮食问题，在解放前一直未获得解决。
    解放以来，由于中国共产党和中央人民政府领导农民进行了伟大的土地改革，执行和贯彻了正确的农业生产、水利建设、农业贷款、农业税征收和粮食经营的政策。在短短三四年期间，就基本改变了中国历史上长期存在的不合理的粮食状况：一、粮食生产恢复并超过了解放前最高年产量的水平。一九五二年产量比一九四九年提高了百分之四十五，比解放前最高年产量超过了百分之十七左右；二、统筹了全国粮食调度。由于政府大力的经常的进行调运工作，不能调度的商品粮（所谓“难运粮”“死角粮”）已逐年减少；三、国家通过农业税征收和市场收购，掌握社会商品粮约占总产量的百分之八十五左右，从而加强了国家在财政、金融和市场上的物质基础。因而，保证了市场和国防的供应，支持了抗美朝援的斗争和国家的建设；打击了投机，稳定了粮价和物价；发展了社会主义商业的阵地；配合了农村的生产救灾，逐步改善了人民的生活。并停止了我国长期以来粮食输入的不利形势，并在统一调度和增产的基础上有了一定数量的必要输出，在粮食战线上我国人民已经取得了伟大的胜利。
    然而必须指出，如果我们认为改变了和改善了解放前不合理的粮食状况，粮食产量恢复并超过了战前水平，因此就可以满足于这种状况，满足于这个水平，认为我国粮食问题已经完全地最后地解决了，那是一种严重的错误。摆在我们面前的任务是：充分熟悉粮食范围内的事务，弄清粮食问题和国家建设等方面的关系，摸清粮食经济的现有状况，掌握其发展动向，通过一系列的斗争和努力，在粮食战线上从恢复时期的胜利，推向建设时期的胜利。
    二
    三四年来，我国粮食产销情况发生了很多变化。首先，是由于广大农民生活已得到初步改善，消费的粮食有显著增加，不少农民生产的粮食因不急于出卖而储存数量增加了。从有些地区的典型调查及统计数字看，大约有百分之六十以上的农民已改变了过去糠菜半年粮的生活，已可维持在吃饱的水平上。大约有百分之二十以上的农民不但可以吃饱，而且开始要求吃得好一点，（例如有些农民面粉细粮吃得很多了，杂粮吃得少了。）并有相当数量的余粮储存。有些地方余粮户占百分之四十以上。另外大约还有百分之十以上的农民生活虽比解放前改善，但目前每年还要缺几个月粮食。但是另一方面，由于今天农业生产基本上还是在分散的个体的使用旧农具的基础上进行，再加上我国幅员广大，交通运输不发达，土地贫富不均匀，因此粮食生产增长的速度，特别是商品粮食增长的速度，还赶不上消费增长的速度；生产和消费上还存在不平衡状况。
    其次，随着我国工业建设的发展，城市人口、工业人口逐渐增加，工业原料作物、畜牧、酿造、食品、油脂等事业也随之逐渐发展，这些都直接间接地增加了商品粮食的需要。而我们耕地面积的扩展和商品粮食产量的增长速度较慢，还赶不上需要。虽然现有粮食产销是平衡的而且有一定积余，但这种发展速度不适应的情况，在实现农业集体化以前，将会越来越明显。
    根据中央农业部的统计，如果以一九五○年至一九五一年的粮食总产量，薯类折粮食总产量各为一百的话，一九五一年至一九五二年粮食产量为一○九点三七，薯类折粮食产量为一一九点四七，一九五二年至一九五三年粮食产量为一三○点五，薯类折粮食产量为百分之一七二点一。这说明粮食的总产量是逐年增加。但是，商品粮的情况如何呢？几年来商品粮的绝对数字也在不断增加，例如今年这个粮食年度的商品粮食比上一个年度增加约为百分之七点九三，可是需要量却增长了百分之二五点一九，其速度显然快于商品粮产量增长的速度。
    这些情况集中地说明了我国几年来粮食的变化情况，说明了我国农业经济与工业经济发展底根本关系问题。斯大林同志在一九二八年十一月“论国家工业化与联共（布）党内的右倾”一文关于五谷问题一节内指出：“只有在农村经济比工业之平常的落后变为农村经济发展的过度落后的时候，农村经济的问题，特别是五谷问题，才在舞台上出现。”显然我国现时农村经济特别是粮食经济的状况，还未到达这种“过度落后”的地步，然而从现在的情况看，这种现象也将在我国出现，我们的任务就在于接受苏联的经验，预见到这一层，及早提出防止与克服的积极办法，尽可能地使粮食经济的发展逐步赶上工业经济的发展。斯大林同志又说：“在这种情况之下，我们的任务，并不是把工业发展的速度减低到五谷经济发展的速度之水平线（这便是颠倒是非且会使发展向后退），而是使五谷经济赶上工业发展的速度，并且把五谷经济发展的速度提高到保证国民经济、工业与农业迅速向前发展之水平线。我们若解决了这个任务，那么五谷问题也就因此而解决，我们不解决这个任务，那么社会主义的城市与小农的乡村中间就不免要发生破裂……五谷问题的实质便是如此。”在这里，斯大林同志把五谷问题提高到保证国民经济、工业与农业发展的水平，指出五谷问题的实质就是城乡关系问题，也就是工农联盟问题。因此巩固粮食战线上的胜利，有预见地稳重妥善地逐步地安排与解决粮食问题，便在全党面前作为一个政治任务被提出来了。
    三
    那么，为了使国家工业化顺利进行，我们应该如何解决我国的粮食问题呢？
    最根本的办法是增产粮食，这是农业生产战线上的首要任务。斯大林同志“在联共（布）第十六次代表大会上中央委员会的政治报告与结论”中说：“在我们面前就摆着下列的农业问题：（一）巩固技术作物的地位底问题，其方法就是在那些区域保证有足量的贱价的粮食生产品。（二）提高牧畜业和解决肉类问题，其方法就是保证那些区内有充分的谷物产品和饲料。（三）彻底解决谷物问题，这是现在农业中的主要问题。这样看来谷物问题是农业中的基本问题，是解决一切其它问题的钥匙”。为了改善农民生活和提高农民的购买力，为了保证满足国家对于粮食和工业原料的需要，都必须大大增加农业生产。工业原料作物，如棉花、大豆、甘蔗、烟叶等，固然要随着工业的发展而逐渐按比例地增加生产，但最重要的是粮食增产。所以说农村工作的基本任务是发展农业生产，而增产粮食应该摆在农业生产的第一位。如果我们能够十分重视粮食的增产，使年产量到达每人平均一千斤左右的时候，我国的粮食就从根本上得到了初步解决。列宁在十月革命后，对苏联的粮食产量曾提出年产八十亿普特（约合我国二千六百亿斤）的奋斗目标，就是说要求达到平均每人每年消费一千二百多斤。我们希望我国经过两个五年计划或者更多一点时间，争取达到年产五千五百亿至六千亿斤原粮的生产水平。
    对我国工业建设中解决粮食问题的长期性认识不足，以及对今后粮食问题麻痹松弛、高枕无忧，坐待其成的思想情绪和作法都是极端有害的。它容易发展一种自流论的倾向，足以损害我们的前途，使我们在政治上犯严重的错误。但同时应该指出：对我国粮食问题，抱任何消极叫唤的态度也是错误的。因为这是不了解我国现有的粮食状况是够吃够用，而且有一定积余，它奠定了逐渐根本解决粮食问题的物质基础。因为这是忽视了我国农业生产、粮食生产的发展可以逐渐稳步地跟随工业生产的发展，因而也就可以逐步解决两者之间发展底不适应情况的客观可能性。因为这是不懂得在现时国家可以通过农业机关和合作社从选种上、农业科学技术上、贷款上、奖励模范上来扶助与发展农业，通过这种扶助换取他们对国家的支持，向国家提供更多的商品粮食，并在这种扶助的基础上发展互助合作运动，以至将来过渡到集体化机械化。最重要的是，凭着党与人民群众长期以来克服困难、战胜困难的力量和经验，凭着党在粮食战线上丰富的斗争经验，凭着党底英明正确的领导，凭着人民觉悟程度、组织程度的不断提高，以及凭着苏联建国的先进经验，我们相信经过艰巨的努力以后，我国的粮食问题必然可以获得解决。
    四
    既然最终解决粮食问题是长期的，因而在逐步增产粮食的同时，加强与改善商品粮食的采购工作就有了特别重要的意义。
    保证粮食的充分收购，这是我们掌握粮食的主要手段。在购粮季节必须保证以足量的、价格合适的生活资料和生产资料充分供应农村（在这里手工业品占着重要的地位），以便尽量地把余粮换取过来（对其它工业原料作物的收购也应如此）。在工业原料作物区农民会因为不能购得足量的工业品，而更多的购买粮食，助长了投机囤粮的心理。米高扬同志一九二七年十二月在联共（布）十五次代表大会上关于第一个五年计划的发言中曾经指出：“收购粮食要采取断然的措施，为了取得农民的粮食，必须把城里的商品调到农村中去，甚至临时使城市的市场完全缺货，亦所必要”。这就足以说明充分供应农业所需工业品对收购粮食的意义。
    与此同时，应加强粮食市场的管理，取缔不正当私商的投机活动，保证粮食收购正常进行，使国家收购足够的商品粮食。
    在收购粮食、供应农村工业品等措施方面，合作社具有特别重要的作用，国营（粮食）商业必须依靠合作社与农民建立密切的供销关系。各级合作社应把购粮当作一项政治任务，通过供应肥料、供应农具、供给日用必需品，与农民订立各种供销、预购、存实的结合合同。
    各级党政机关应该加强对粮食采购工作的领导，统一部署，对农民加强爱国主义教育，加强总路线的教育，通过农村党的组织，动员党员带头号召农民把余粮卖给国家，从最近一个时期农民踊跃卖粮给国家的事例看，完成粮食采购任务是有充分信心的。
    为使采购的粮食能够保证市场的需要，必须十分重视组织正确的供应调运和储备工作。应有计划地有控制地有重点地组织供应，保证城市、工矿、经济作物区和灾区的粮食需要，为此，应加强调运工作的计划性，设法改进过去粮食调运被迫集中在几个月内，而且常常集中在需要粮食的季节进行调运的缺点。死角粮、难运粮应尽一切可能调运出来，使物尽其用。对过去严重影响粮食调运的小仓库制度必须坚决改变。此外必须妥善地组织运输、押运和交接等项工作，并改善它们相互的联系和衔接。建立一套切实可行的调运制度。
    为了保证国家建设的顺利进行和应付意外事件，必须增加粮食储备的数字，规定五年的储备目标，分布在国家指定的储备线上。
    此外必须运用正确的价格政策，指导消费，平衡品种，奖励多种高产量作物，节约粮食，减少不必要的浪费，适当限制酿造、肥料、饲养的消耗，提倡对其他用品的利用。
    粮食是一个关系我国人民生活利益的商品，是工农联盟重要的物质基础之一。粮食问题与国家经济建设直接关联着，必须及早使全党和全体干部深切明了粮食问题的发展趋势，摸清粮食情况，弄清粮食工作的基本任务和基本政策。领导全国人民为改善今后的粮食状况，为争取粮食战线上新的胜利而斗争。
