Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 22nd: Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao, Chief Delegate of the Korean-Chinese side to the Military Armistice Commission, sent a letter to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on the 22nd, protesting the so-called "explanatory statement" that the US side is preparing to use to explain to American POWs in Songgok-ri.

The US side’s proposal of the so-called “explanatory statement” after ceasing explanations to POWs in Songgok-ri is clearly an attempt to cover up the truth that the US side is unwilling to continue explanations to avoid a greater failure in "Cold War" propaganda, and at the same time use this "explanatory statement" to directly threaten American POWs who are not directly repatriated.

According to news reports, this already published "explanatory statement" is permeated with threats to POWs who are unwilling to return to the United States. The "explanatory statement" claims that if POWs decide not to return to the United States, they will be making a decision that is extremely relevant to their fate, that this decision will be unchangeable, and that POWs should consider the consequences of this decision.

General Li Xiangchao requested the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission to uphold its "Terms of Reference" and ensure that POWs are not threatened. General Li Xiangchao pointed out in the letter that Clause 11 of the "Terms of Reference" clearly stipulates that even after non-directly repatriated POWs have been released from POW status, the authorities in the area where they are located shall be responsible for assisting them in returning to their home countries if they wish to do so. Although the US side’s so-called “explanatory statement” is full of hypocritical words, it seriously violates the letter and spirit of the "Terms of Reference" and the fact that it threatens and insults POWs cannot be concealed.

### 李相朝中将致函中立国遣返委员会  抗议美方准备利用“解释书”威胁美方战俘

    李相朝中将致函中立国遣返委员会
    抗议美方准备利用“解释书”威胁美方战俘
    【新华社开城二十二日电】军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将二十二日致函中立国遣返委员会，对美方准备用来对松谷里美国战俘进行解释的所谓“解释书”提出抗议。
    美方在停止对松谷里战俘进行解释以后提出所谓“解释书”，显然是要掩饰美方为避免“冷战”宣传上的更大失败而不愿继续解释的真相，同时利用这一“解释书”来对不直接遣返的美国战俘直接进行威胁。
    根据新闻报道，这一已经发表的“解释书”贯穿着对不愿回到美国去的战俘的威胁。这个“解释书”声称如果战俘们决定不回美国，他们就将作出一个与命运极为有关的决定，这个决定将是不可更改的，并要求战俘们考虑这一决定的后果。
    李相朝将军要求中立国遣返委员会维护“职权范围”并保证战俘不受威胁。李相朝将军在信中指出：“职权范围”第十一款明白规定，不直接遣返的战俘即使在已被解除战俘身份后如有希望回到他们的祖国的，所在地区当局应负责协助他们回返祖国。美方的所谓“解释书”虽然充满着伪善的词句，但它严重违反“职权范围”的文字和精神，威胁和侮辱战俘的事实，显然是不能掩盖的。
