Integrate the Publicity of the National General Line and Run This Year's Winter School Well

	Conducting large-scale publicity among the peasants regarding the general line of the state during the transition period is an important political task in the current rural work. The "Instructions on Winter School Work in 1953" jointly issued by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government and the National Illiteracy Elimination Work Committee of the Central People's Government clearly point out: "This year's winter school should generally focus on political education, with its content particularly emphasizing the general line of national economic construction, the state's policy on food, and the continued development of mutual aid and cooperation, improvement of agricultural technology, and increase in food production." The instructions also point out that when teaching political lessons, in addition to the original winter school students, efforts should be made to call on and organize the general public to participate in the study. This is very correct.

	Past experience has proven that carrying out political and current affairs education among the broad masses of peasants through winter schools has played a significant role in coordinating local central work and enhancing the political awareness of peasants. To lead peasants to support the country's socialist industrialization and gradually complete the socialist transformation of agriculture in accordance with the state's general line during the transition period, it is necessary to use all possible opportunities and adopt various forms to repeatedly publicize the general line to the peasants, and winter school is an important place to systematically conduct the publicity of the general line. First of all, it is necessary to educate all cadres participating in winter school work to understand the significant political meaning of publicizing the general line in this year's winter school and prevent the tendency of some cadres to only carry out cultural education in winter school without paying attention to political education.

	When publicizing the general line in winter school, it is necessary to make the peasants understand why they must take the socialist road and how to take the socialist road. The publicity of the general line cannot just talk about general principles, but must be linked to the current central work, mainly to the planned purchase of grain. It is necessary to explain and publicize by using specific and vivid facts and model examples, targeting the ideological situation of the local peasants when selling surplus grain. Secondly, it is necessary to combine with the actual situation of local mutual aid and cooperation to educate the broad masses of peasants to take the road to common prosperity. Thirdly, it is necessary to mobilize peasants to actively carry out winter production and make active preparations for next year's production. To complete the above tasks, in addition to seriously conducting the publicity and education of the general line for cultural teachers in winter schools, the local county party committees must also designate appropriate people from the rural party branches, propagandists, and rural cadres to serve as political teachers in winter schools, and promptly provide them with publicity outlines and related materials. The content of education should be popular and specific, and should be combined with the actual life and thinking of the masses, using methods such as detailed accounting, comparison, and recollection, and through methods such as giving large lectures, group discussions, and group chats, to carry out in a planned way. Experience has proven that winter schools with good political education results are those where teachers understand the thinking of the masses, explain the content of political lessons in popular language, and adopt various forms of teaching. All localities must pay attention to guiding teaching and promptly check its teaching effectiveness.

	This year's cultural learning in winter schools can appropriately stipulate the learning progress according to last year's experience and this year's situation, as well as the different learning conditions of the students. It should be pointed out that it is absolutely necessary to carry out socialist transformation of agriculture, gradually organize the scattered small-scale peasant economy and move towards collectivization, and eliminate illiteracy among peasants in a step-by-step manner. Lenin said in "On Cooperation": "Cultural work among the peasants, if it is regarded as an economic goal, is precisely to implement cooperation... But the condition for complete cooperation is that it includes a high cultural level of the peasants (precisely the broad masses of peasants), that is, without the entire cultural revolution, complete cooperation cannot be realized." And the basic prerequisite for cultural revolution is the elimination of illiteracy. This is the relationship between the elimination of illiteracy and the socialist transformation of agriculture. The elimination of illiteracy should be steadily advanced on the basis of gradually carrying out the socialist transformation of agriculture and under the conditions of serving the socialist transformation of agriculture. It is wrong to isolate the emphasis on cultural education work, divorced from the realistic conditions of the countryside, and disregarding the current work situation; but it is also wrong to fundamentally disregard the peasants' demand for learning culture, fail to see the trend that this demand will inevitably increase with the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, neglect the role of improving the cultural level of peasants in the socialist transformation of agriculture, and think that literacy work in rural areas is dispensable, and thus fail to adopt a positive spirit to lead this work in a down-to-earth manner.

	The work of eliminating illiteracy in the past year or so has been successful. It is estimated that by the end of the winter school next spring, 3 million peasants will have reached the standard of non-illiteracy, which will greatly encourage the peasants' confidence in learning. In the future, forms such as winter schools, people's schools, literacy classes, and literacy groups will continue to be used to gradually eliminate illiteracy in rural areas. This year's cultural learning in winter schools should be properly planned and arranged on the premise of not hindering the publicity of the general line and the central work. The national situation is different, and it is not appropriate to demand uniformity in requirements and practices.

	To enable this year's winter school to correctly and effectively publicize the national general line and the food planned purchase policy, as well as appropriately conduct cultural education, party committees and governments at all levels should strengthen their leadership over this work and promptly solve problems such as teachers, teaching materials, and funding. At the end of this winter school, attention should also be paid to summarizing experience in order to prepare better conditions for next year's winter school work.

### 结合宣传国家总路线，办好今年冬学

    结合宣传国家总路线，办好今年冬学
    向农民大张旗鼓地宣传国家过渡时期的总路线，是当前农村工作的一项重要政治任务。中央人民政府教育部和中央人民政府扫除文盲工作委员会联合发布的关于一九五三年冬学工作的指示中明确指出：“今年冬学，一般以进行政治教育为主，其内容应特别注重关于国家经济建设的总路线，国家对粮食的政策和继续发展互助合作，改进农业技术，提高粮食产量等三项”。指示并指出，在上政治课的时候，除原有冬学学员外，应尽量号召和组织一般群众参加学习。这是很正确的。
    过去的经验证明：通过冬学向广大农民进行政治时事教育，对配合当地各项中心工作，提高农民的政治认识，曾起了很大的作用。为了领导农民按照国家在过渡时期的总路线，支持国家的社会主义工业化，逐步完成对农业的社会主义改造，必须利用一切可能利用的机会，采用各种形式，向农民反复进行总路线的宣传，而冬学正是较有系统地进行总路线宣传的重要场所。首先必须教育所有参加冬学工作的干部懂得今年冬学中宣传总路线的重大政治意义，防止某些干部在冬学中只进行文化教育，不注意政治教育的偏向。
    在冬学中进行总路线的宣传时，要使农民懂得为什么必须走社会主义的道路，和怎样走社会主义的道路。关于总路线的宣传，不能光讲大道理，必须联系当前的中心工作，主要是联系粮食的计划收购工作。要针对着当地农民在出售余粮时的思想情况，用具体生动的事实和模范事例来进行讲解和宣传。其次就要结合当地互助合作的实际情况，教育广大农民走向大家富裕的道路。再次，要动员农民积极进行冬季生产和对明年的生产作积极的准备。为了完成上述的任务，除对冬学中的文化教师要认真地进行总路线的宣传教育外，各地县委还必须在农村党的支部、宣传员和乡村干部中，指定适当的人担任冬学的政治教员，并及时地供给他们宣传提纲和有关材料。教育内容要通俗具体，要结合群众的生活实际和思想实际，用算细账、对比、回忆等方法通过上大课、小组讨论、小组漫谈等方式，有计划地进行。经验证明，凡是政治教育效果良好的冬学，都是因为教师懂得群众的思想情况，用通俗的语言讲解政治课的内容，和采取多种形式进行教学。各地必须注意对教学的指导，及时检查其教学效果。
    今年冬学的文化学习，各地可根据去年的经验和今年的情况以及学员的不同的学习条件，适当地规定学习进度。应当指出：要对农业进行社会主义改造，逐步地使分散的小农经济组织起来走向合作化，有步骤地扫除农民中的文盲，是完全必要的。列宁在“论合作制”中说：“农民中的文化工作，如果将它当作经济目的看待，那就正是要实行合作化。……但这完全合作化的条件，是包含有农民
  （正是广大农民群众）底高度文化水准在内，即如果没有整个的文化革命，那么，完全合作化便是不可能实现的。”而文化革命的基本前提，便是扫除文盲。这便是扫除文盲工作与对农业的社会主义改造的关系。扫除文盲工作，应当在逐步进行对农业的社会主义改造的基础上和为农业社会主义改造服务的条件下，稳步前进。脱离农村现实条件，不照顾当前工作情况，孤立地强调文化教育工作是错误的；但根本不考虑农民对学习文化的要求，看不到随着互助合作运动的开展，这种要求将必然要日益增长的趋势，忽视提高农民文化水平对农业的社会主义改造的作用，认为农村中的扫盲工作是可有可无的，因而不采取积极的精神实事求是地领导进行这一工作，也是错误的。
    一年多来的扫除文盲工作是有成绩的。估计到明春冬学结束时，将有三百万的农民达到非文盲标准，这将大大地鼓舞农民对学习的信心。今后将继续采用冬学、民校、识字班、识字组等形式，逐步扫除农村中的文盲。今年冬学的文化学习，各地应在不妨碍总路线的宣传和中心工作的前提下，作妥善的计划和布置。全国情况不同，在要求和作法上也不宜强求一律。
    为了使今年冬学正确而有效地宣传国家总路线和粮食计划收购政策，以及适当地进行文化教育，各级党委和政府应该加强对这一工作的领导，及时地解决教员、教材、经费等问题。在本期冬学结束时，还应注意总结经验，以便为明年的冬学工作准备更好的条件。
