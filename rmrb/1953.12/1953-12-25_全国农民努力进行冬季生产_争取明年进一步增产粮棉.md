Xinhua News Agency, December 24th: Encouraged by the general line and general task of the state's transition period, farmers across the country are working hard to carry out winter production to create conditions for further increasing the production of grain and industrial raw materials such as cotton next year. At present, most areas have made preliminary achievements in winter production.

    Farmers in the Northeast region are universally engaged in winter sideline production to prepare sufficient funds for agricultural production next year. Heilongjiang Province plans a total output value of one million tons of grain for winter sideline production this winter. Counties, adapting to local conditions, are organizing farmers to harvest reeds, fish, hunt, weave, and transport. Rehe Province plans a total output value of 240,000 tons of grain for winter sideline production this winter. Farmers are mainly engaged in raising pigs and sheep, digging medicinal materials, and hunting. Farmers in Liaodong, Liaoxi, and other provinces are also organized to carry out a variety of sideline production.

    In the North China region, Shanxi Province had plowed more than 80% of the autumn fields before the freeze in late November, and the deep plowing area in various places has increased compared with previous years. In 198 townships in 12 counties including Changzi and Hongdong, the province has now accumulated more than 65 million dan of various fertilizers. In Lingchuan County, out of more than 20,000 mu of autumn fields in 76 agricultural production cooperatives, in addition to universally plowing once and accumulating 78 dan of fertilizer per mu, 30% of the land border embankments have been renovated. The Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Pingshun County further renovated the reservoir, increasing the water storage capacity by one time compared to the past. Farmers in the southern and central wheat producing areas are wintering and applying top dressing to protect the wheat seedlings to safely overwinter.

    In the East China region, Shandong Province has basically completed winter plowing, and many areas have increased the area and depth of plowing; in the sixth district of Liangshan County, more than 20,000 farmers have followed the plow to pick up insects, clearing 16,000 jin of underground pests. At present, fertilizer accumulation work is gradually being carried out throughout the province. Even farmers in Lianlan and other counties, who have never been accustomed to winter fertilizer accumulation, are universally pushing soil to compost manure and cutting grass to burn ash for fertilizer storage. Due to the active top dressing and watering by farmers in the wheat producing areas, the wheat seedlings are growing well. Jiangsu Province has completed winter plowing of more than 6 million mu of single-season paddy fields, generally plowing two or three times; more than 10 million mu of dry land winter fallow fields have also been plowed for more than half. In Zhejiang Province, the sown area of wheat, rapeseed, and other crops has exceeded last year in many places, and farmers are working hard to weed and apply top dressing. Farmers in Jiaxing Prefecture have purchased agricultural boats to salvage river mud, aquatic plants, and other fertilizers. Farmers in Xindeng County are starting to build water conservancy projects. In the six townships of Luxian District alone, 27 reservoirs have been built.

    In the Central South region, winter agricultural production is extremely active in various places. Guangdong Province has completed winter planting of about 10 million mu. The Provincial People's Government and the National Bank have allocated 80 billion yuan for water conservancy investment and loans, more than double the amount for the entire last year; after receiving this amount, farmers in various places have started to build farmland water conservancy projects. Farmers in the province are also actively composting green manure or digging river mud as fertilizer. Farmers in the Chaoshan area are vigorously digging rice roots to eliminate rice borers. Guangxi Province has sown more than 8 million mu of wheat, beans, sweet potatoes, and other crops this winter. Farmers of all ethnic groups have begun to protect seedlings and apply top dressing in order to strive for a bumper harvest next year. Winter planting in Jiangxi Province has also been largely completed. According to incomplete statistics from six prefectures including Nanchang, Fuzhou, Ji'an, Ganzhou, Shangrao, and Jiujiang, the planting area of wheat, barley, rapeseed, broad beans, peas, and radishes alone has reached more than 10 million mu, close to the total area of winter planting in the province last year. Winter plowing, pest control, and farmland water conservancy construction are also being stepped up throughout the province. In Hunan Province, the winter plowing area of paddy fields has exceeded 70%, and the sown area of winter miscellaneous grains and green manure crops totals more than 20 million mu, an increase of more than 30% compared to last year. The annual repair project of the Dongting Lake embankment in the province has started in full swing, and ponds and reservoirs in mountainous and hilly areas have also begun to be renovated. In terms of fertilizer accumulation, Shuangtong Township in Hanshou County has dispatched more than 130 boats every day since December to salvage lake grass. After checking seedlings and replanting in various places in Henan Province, the wheat fields have basically guaranteed full seedlings. Farmers in Dancheng County also cleared more than 2,000 jin of underground pests during the inspection and replanting of seedlings. Winter fallow land in many areas of the province has been plowed for about 70%. In addition, various places are leading farmers to carry out handicraft and sideline production in accordance with local conditions to increase income.

    In the Southwest region, various places are focusing on developing winter agricultural production, and appropriately paying attention to sideline production. In Guizhou Province, more than 70% of the winter fields in the central area have been plowed. Farmers in some mountainous areas of Ya'an and Xichang Prefectures in Xikang Province, Daxian, Wanxian, and Fuling Prefectures in Sichuan Province, and Yiliang and Zhaotong Prefectures in Yunnan Province are building small-scale water conservancy projects, processing land, changing dry land into paddy fields, and changing sloping land into terraced fields to increase the soil layer and reduce erosion. In order to ensure full seedlings of wheat and other crops, farmers in various places in the Southwest region are stepping up efforts to replant, thin seedlings, remove insects, and apply top dressing.

    In the Northwest region, according to incomplete statistics in Gansu Province, 3.35 million mu of farmland have been irrigated with winter water, waiting for sowing after spring plowing next year. The mountainous area of the Dongxiang Autonomous Region in the province has been plowed twice, and the river valley and loess plateau areas have generally been plowed four times. In the autonomous region, on the land along the two banks of the Taohe River, Daxia River, and Tongguang River, Dongxiang farmers have irrigated more than 10,000 mu of farmland with winter water. Dongxiang farmers living in mountainous areas are busy accumulating fertilizer, striving to apply more than 20 more loads of manure per mu of land next year than this year.

    全国农民努力进行冬季生产
    争取明年进一步增产粮棉
    【新华社二十四日讯】在国家过渡时期的总路线总任务的鼓舞下，全国农民努力展开冬季生产，为明年进一步增产粮食和棉花等工业原料创造条件。目前，大部地区冬季生产已做出初步成绩。
    东北区农民正普遍进行冬季副业生产，给明年农业生产准备充足的资金。黑龙江省计划今冬副业生产总值一百万吨粮食，各县多因地制宜，组织农民打苇子、捕鱼、打猎、编织、运输等。热河省计划今冬副业生产总值二十四万吨粮食，农民主要从事养猪、养羊、挖药材和打猎。辽东、辽西等省农民也有组织地展开了多种多样的副业生产。
    华北区山西省在十一月底封冻前，耕过的秋地已有百分之八十以上，各地深耕面积都比往年增加。该省长子、洪洞等十二个县一百九十八个乡，目前已积聚各种肥料六千五百多万担。陵川县七十六个农业生产合作社的两万多亩秋地，除普遍耕过一遍和每亩积肥七十八担外，土地边堰整修过的占百分之三十。平顺县李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社进一步修整了蓄水池，使蓄水量比过去增加一倍。南部和中部小麦产区农民正在冬浇和施追肥，以保护麦苗安全过冬。
    华东区山东省冬耕已基本结束，很多地区增加了耕犁的面积和深度；梁山县第六区有两万多个农民随犁拾虫，清除地下害虫一万六千斤。目前积肥工作正在该省各地逐步展开，连向来不习惯冬季积肥的蓼兰等县农民，也普遍推土沤粪和割草烧灰积储肥料。小麦产区由于农民积极进行追肥、浇水，麦苗生长良好。江苏省六百多万亩一熟水田已完成冬耕，一般耕了两三遍；一千多万亩旱地冬闲田也已耕完一半以上。浙江省各地小麦、油菜等播种面积多超过去年，农民正紧张除草、追肥。嘉兴专区农民纷纷添买农船，捞挖河泥、水草等肥料。新登县农民正动工兴修水利，仅陆贤区六个乡就已修好蓄水塘二十七口。
    中南区各地冬季农业生产极为活跃。广东省已完成冬种面积一千万亩左右。省人民政府和国家银行拨发了水利投资和贷款八百亿元，比去年全年增加一倍多；各地农民得到这笔款项后，已纷纷动手兴修农田水利。该省农民并积极沤绿肥或挖河泥作肥料，潮汕地区农民大力挖掘稻根，除治螟虫。广西省今冬播种小麦、豆类、红薯等八百多万亩，各族农民已开始保苗、追肥，争取明年丰收。江西省的冬种也已大体结束。据南昌、抚州、吉安、赣州、上饶、九江等六个专区的不完全统计，仅小麦、大麦、油菜、蚕豆、豌豆、萝卜的种植面积就已有一千多万亩，接近去年全省冬种的总面积。该省各地冬耕、除虫和兴修农田水利等工作也在加紧进行。湖南省水田的冬耕面积已超过百分之七十，播种的冬种杂粮和绿肥作物共有二千多万亩，比去年增加了百分之三十以上。该省洞庭湖堤防岁修工程已全面开工，山区和丘陵地区的塘坝、水库等也已开始整修。在积肥方面，仅汉寿县双铜乡十二月份以来就每天出动一百三十多只船打捞湖草。河南省各地麦田经过查苗补种，基本上保证了全苗。郸城县农民在查苗补种中还清除地下害虫二千多斤。该省很多地区的冬闲地已耕好百分之七十左右。此外，各地并因地制宜领导农民进行手工业和副业生产，以增加收入。
    西南区各地正着重开展冬季农业生产，并适当注意副业生产。贵州省中心地区的冬田已犁翻百分之七十以上。西康省雅安、西昌两专区、四川省达县、万县、涪陵等专区和云南省宜良、昭通等专区的部分山区农民，正在兴修小型水利，进行土地加工，改旱地为水田，改坡地为梯田，以增厚土层，减少冲刷。为了保证小麦等作物全苗，西南区各地农民正抓紧进行补种匀栽、除虫和施用追肥。
    西北区甘肃省据不完全统计，已有三百三十五万亩农田灌上冬水，等待明年春耕后播种。该省东乡自治区的山地已耕过两遍，川地和塬地一般已耕过四遍。在自治区内沿洮河、大夏河和通广河两岸的土地上，东乡族农民已把一万多亩农田灌上冬水。居住在山区的东乡族农民正忙着积肥，争取明年每亩地要比今年多上二十多驮粪。
