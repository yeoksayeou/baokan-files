Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 20th—Following repeated efforts by the Korean-Chinese side, the explanation work for prisoners of war (POWs) who do not directly request repatriation will resume on December 21st. On December 21st, the Korean-Chinese side will conduct individual explanations to 250 captured Chinese People's Volunteer Army personnel in Camp No. 3 of the East Camp POW camp. Since November 17th, the explanation work by the Korean-Chinese side has been interrupted for 34 consecutive days. The reason for this is that the special agents arranged by the US side resisted the provisions of the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visits" regarding the isolation of POWs who have heard explanations from those who have not. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC) and the Indian Custodial Forces also failed to exercise and fulfill the powers and responsibilities entrusted to the Commission by its "Terms of Reference" to arrange for the timely isolation of POWs and to implement the regulations for isolating POWs.
    As early as November 6th, at the request of the Korean-Chinese side, the NNRC promised to build an isolation camp in the East Camp POW camp, in accordance with the "Working Rules," to implement the regulations for isolating POWs. However, the NNRC and the Indian Custodial Forces did not implement this promise, but instead claimed that the special agents, the so-called "camp leaders," opposed isolating POWs who had been explained to from those who had not, and prevented POWs from listening to explanations. Therefore, even if an isolation camp were built, it would have no practical effect. The Korean-Chinese side immediately pointed out that the NNRC and the Indian Custodial Forces have the power and obligation to implement the "Terms of Reference" and the "Working Rules," and should never listen to the words of special agents and refuse to take practical measures to isolate POWs. Under the repeated urging of the Korean-Chinese side, the NNRC and the Indian Custodial Forces finally arranged isolation facilities on December 10th. However, the NNRC and the Indian Custodial Forces still did not take measures to implement the regulations for isolating POWs, still claiming that "camp leaders" opposed isolation, with the result that the explanation work of the Korean-Chinese side could not be resumed until December 20th.
    In order to resume its explanation work as soon as possible, the Korean-Chinese side has made repeated efforts. After the NNRC arranged the isolation facilities in the East Camp POW camp, the Korean-Chinese side immediately proposed a plan on December 11th to conduct explanations to Camp No. 53. When the NNRC still claimed that the US special agents in Camp No. 53 illegally opposed isolation measures and refused to allow POWs to listen to explanations, and therefore the explanation work could not be resumed, the Korean-Chinese side, on the one hand, pointed out that the NNRC and the Indian Custodial Forces should immediately take resolute measures to implement the regulations for isolating POWs, and on the other hand, stated on December 17th that it could reserve the right to explain to the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army in Camp No. 53, and instead conduct explanations to the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army in Camp No. 38.
    The NNRC and the Indian Custodial Forces neither gave a specific reply to this effort by the Korean-Chinese side, nor stated any reasons, but only claimed that they could not arrange for POWs to listen to explanations. On December 20th, in order to resume the explanation work, the Korean-Chinese side made another new effort and sent a letter to the NNRC, stating that it could reserve the right to explain to the captured personnel of the Korean People's Army in Camp No. 38, and proposed to conduct explanations to the captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in Camp No. 3 on December 21st. That afternoon, the Korean-Chinese side received a notice from the NNRC that explanations could be carried out on December 21st.
    Although the explanation work in the East Camp POW camp has been resumed due to the repeated efforts of the Korean-Chinese side, the conspiracy of special agents to continue to sabotage the explanation work under the instigation of the US side is completely foreseeable. The US side must bear full responsibility for this. Whether the explanation work of the Korean-Chinese side can proceed smoothly will depend on whether the NNRC and the Indian Custodial Forces will assume their legal responsibilities, take practical and effective measures, eliminate the control of special agents over POWs, and ensure the implementation of the "Terms of Reference" and the "Working Rules."

### 东场里解释工作经我方努力在昨日恢复

    东场里解释工作经我方努力在昨日恢复
    【新华社开城二十日电】在朝中方面一再努力下，朝中方面对不直接遣返的战俘的解释工作将于十二月二十一日再行开始。十二月二十一日，朝中方面将对东场里战俘营第三号营场的二百五十名中国人民志愿军被俘人员进行个别解释。自十一月十七日以来，朝中方面的解释工作已继续中断达三十四天之久，其原因在于美方所布置的特务，抗拒“解释和访问工作细则”关于隔离听过解释与尚未听过解释的战俘的规定，中立国遣返委员会与印度看管部队也没有行使并履行“职权范围”所赋予该委员会的权力与职责，及时进行隔离战俘的安排，并贯彻隔离战俘的规定。
    早在十一月六日，中立国遣返委员会在朝中方面的要求下，曾允诺在东场里战俘营，按照“工作细则”修建隔离营场，执行隔离战俘的规定。但中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队并未实施这一允诺，却相反地声称所谓“营场头目”的特务反对隔离已经解释与未经解释的战俘，不让战俘听取解释，因此即使修建隔离营场亦无实际效用。朝中方面当即指出，中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队有实施“职权范围”和“工作细则”的权力和义务，决不应听从特务之词，拒不采取隔离战俘的实际措施。在朝中方面的一再催促下，中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队终于在十二月十日安排了隔离的设备，但中立国遣返委员会与印度看管部队却仍不采取措施，贯彻隔离战俘的规定，依然声称“营场头目”反对隔离，以致朝中方面的解释工作，直至十二月二十日为止，始终未能恢复。
    朝中方面为使其解释工作得以尽速恢复，曾一次又一次地作了努力。在中立国遣返委员会安排好东场里战俘营的隔离设备后，朝中方面即在十二月十一日提出了向第五十三号营场进行解释的计划。当中立国遣返委员会仍然声称第五十三号营场的美方特务非法反对隔离措施，并拒绝让战俘前往听取解释，因而解释工作无法恢复时；朝中方面一面指出中立国遣返委员会与印度看管部队应立即采取坚决措施，贯彻隔离战俘的规定，另一方面又于十二月十七日表示，可保留对第五十三号营场的朝鲜人民军被俘人员进行解释的权利，而改向第三十八号营场的朝鲜人民军被俘人员进行解释。
    对于朝中方面的这一努力，中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队既未给予具体答复，也未申述任何理由，而只声称不能安排战俘听取解释。十二月二十日，朝中方面为了解释工作的恢复，又作了一次新的努力，致函中立国遣返委员会，表示可保留对第三十八号营场的朝鲜人民军被俘人员进行解释的权利，提出在十二月二十一日向第三号营场的中国人民志愿军被俘人员进行解释。当日下午，朝中方面获得中立国遣返委员会的通知，十二月二十一日可以进行解释。
    东场里战俘营的解释工作，虽然由于朝中方面的一再努力而得以恢复，但特务在美方指使下继续破坏解释工作的阴谋是完全可以预料的，对此美方必须担负完全的责任。朝中方面的解释工作能否顺利进行，将有视于中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队是否将担负起其合法职责，采取实际有效措施，肃清特务对战俘的控制，保证“职权范围”和“工作细则”的实施。
