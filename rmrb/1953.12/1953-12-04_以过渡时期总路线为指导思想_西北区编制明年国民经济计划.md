    Guided by the General Line for the Transition Period
    The Northwest Region Compiles Next Year's National Economic Plan
    The work of compiling the Northwest Region's 1954 National Economic Plan has entered an intense phase. Draft plans from many grassroots units have already been submitted, and the entire region is expected to complete the task by early December. The compilation of the Northwest Region's 1954 National Economic Plan represents significant progress and improvement compared to the compilation of the 1953 plan last year. Firstly, the preparatory work was better. In September, the Northwest Financial and Economic Committee organized a group of planning personnel from the Northwest Region level and various provinces and cities to study the instructions, methods, and regulations for compiling the plan. When the formal compilation of the plan began, the Northwest Bureau of the CCP Central Committee issued instructions to Party committees at all levels. The Northwest Financial and Economic Committee organized six working groups to assist the work in various provinces and cities, promoting the compilation work in various localities. Secondly, the allocation of state control figures at each level and the discussion of planning work were carried out meticulously. In particular, Party committees at all levels took personal leadership, clarified the situation, and used the advanced norms that emerged during the increase production and practice economy campaign as the basis for formulating the plan, resulting in a more advanced plan. Most units in the industrial and mining enterprise system also organized the masses of workers to participate in discussions during the compilation of the plan, giving the plan a mass foundation. Thirdly, in the process of compiling the plan, some erroneous ideas of greed and recklessness, disregarding the overall situation, were overcome. For example, the economic allocations for local state-owned industries, urban construction, agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry in the figures originally proposed by the Northwest Region were significantly reduced after review, some by more than half. Some units were concerned that the funding would not be sufficient, but after some calculation and studying the state's policy of "increasing production, practicing strict economy, focusing on key construction, and advancing steadily," they felt that some of the reduced portions were enough to use.
    The compilation of the Northwest Region's 1954 National Economic Plan is guided by the state's general line and general task for the transition period, especially the implementation of the basic policy of the First Five-Year Plan. This can be seen from the plans that have already been compiled by some departments, where the proportion of socialist economic components has increased significantly. According to incomplete statistics from the thirteen professional administrative bureaus or offices in the Northwest Region, the state investment in 1954 will increase by about one-third compared to this year, of which heavy industry accounts for more than 50% of industrial construction, an increase of about 100% compared to this year. The textile industry, which is closely related to people's livelihood, accounts for about 37% of the industrial investment in 1954, an increase of 127% compared to this year. These investments will be used to build some large-scale factories and mines in 1954, and to carry out the design, exploration, and drilling work of many new factories and mines. According to the control figures, the total output value of the region in 1954 will increase by about 23% compared to this year, of which local state-owned industry will increase by 35.8%. In terms of agriculture, the planned grain output will increase by 4.3% compared to this year.
    Currently, the work of compiling the 1954 plan is not yet balanced enough. Some units do not have a sufficient understanding of the state's policy of focusing on key construction and advancing steadily. Some appropriation figures are sufficient based on the tasks of 1954 and their own strength, but they blindly demand increases. The relevant leading units are paying attention to correcting these shortcomings.

    以过渡时期总路线为指导思想
    西北区编制明年国民经济计划
    西北区一九五四年度国民经济计划编制工作，已进入紧张阶段，有不少基层单位的计划草案已经上报，全区可在十二月上旬完成。西北区一九五四年度国民经济计划编制工作，比去年编制一九五三年度国民经济计划有很大的进步和提高。首先是准备工作做得比较好。西北财政经济委员会在九月间组织了西北区级和各省市的一批计划工作人员，对编制计划的指示、办法、规定等进行了学习。正式开始编制计划时，中共中央西北局又向各级党委发出指示。西北财政经济委员会组织了六个工作组，到各省市协助工作，推动了各地的编制工作。其次，逐级分配国家控制数字和讨论计划工作做得认真细致，特别是各级党委亲自领导，摸清底子，把增产节约运动中出现的先进定额作为订计划的根据，因而编制出的计划比较先进。工矿企业系统的多数单位，在编制计划中还组织职工群众进行了讨论，使计划有了群众基础。第三，在编制计划过程中，克服了一些贪多冒进、不顾整体的错误思想。如西北区原提出数字中的地方国营工业、城市建设、农林水牧等系统的经济拨款，经审核削减了很多，有的减少了一半以上。有些单位顾虑经费开支不够，但经过一番核算和研究了国家“增加生产、厉行节约、重点建设、稳步前进”的方针以后，感到有些被削减的部分已够使用。
    西北区一九五四年度国民经济计划的编制工作，是以国家在过渡时期的总路线和总任务为指导思想来进行的，特别是贯彻了第一个五年计划的基本方针。这从目前某些部门已经编制出的计划来看，社会主义经济成分比重有显著的增长。根据西北区十三个专业管理局或办事处的不完全统计，一九五四年国家投资额比今年约增加了三分之一左右，其中工业建设中重工业约占百分之五十以上，比今年增加约一倍左右；与人民生活有密切关系的纺织工业，约占一九五四年工业投资额百分之三十七左右，比今年增长了百分之一百二十七。这些投资将在一九五四年要用来建设一些大型的厂矿，并进行很多新建厂矿的设计、勘察、钻探工作。按照控制数字全区一九五四年生产总值比今年增加百分之二十三左右，其中地方国营工业增加百分之三十五点八；农业方面，粮食产量计划比今年增加百分之四点三。
    目前编制一九五四年计划工作，还进行得不够平衡，有些单位对国家重点建设、稳步前进的方针认识不够，本来有些拨款数字根据一九五四年的任务和本身力量是够用的，却盲目地要求增加，有关领导单位对这些缺点正注意纠正。
