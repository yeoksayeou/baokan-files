The CCP Central Committee North China Bureau recently issued instructions on strengthening rural winter production and preparations for agricultural production increase next year.

The instructions pointed out: This winter's rural work tasks are heavy and important, requiring the entire Party's efforts. Under the premise of vigorously publicizing and implementing the Party's general line and general task during the transition period, fully mobilize the masses to complete all tasks on schedule, in order to welcome the arrival of the first year of the First Five-Year Plan. The instructions also pointed out: In completing these heavy work tasks, there are many new and favorable conditions, such as the widespread development of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement, which has already shown its superiority; the national industrialization cause has begun actively, and its impact on rural work will be increasingly strengthened; the Party's general line during the transition period has greatly encouraged farmers' enthusiasm for socialism and promoted farmers' initiative in mutual aid and cooperation. These are the basic driving forces for further advancing rural work in the future. In addition, there is also a contradiction between the many tasks and the short time, and insufficient strength in this winter's rural work. The key to solving this contradiction lies in adhering to production work as the center, planning the allocation of forces, and interspersing production, mutual aid and cooperation work, grain work, and general election work.

The instructions put forward five specific tasks for rural production work this winter:

One, the central link in carrying out winter production is to rectify and develop agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams. Under the principle of active leadership and steady development, strive to double or even more the number of agricultural production cooperatives next year on the basis of the six thousand three hundred cooperatives in 1953. Mutual aid teams should also continue to develop. In completing this task, work must be carried out according to the different conditions in each region. In areas where mutual aid teams already have a considerable foundation, the focus should be on consolidation and improvement, the key to which is to effectively run agricultural production cooperatives, in order to point out the direction for further development to the mutual aid teams (but leadership over mutual aid teams must not be neglected or relaxed in the slightest). In areas where mutual aid teams have a weak foundation or are blank, mutual aid teams should be developed in large numbers with planning and leadership. At the same time, as long as there are other favorable conditions, such as the masses being willing to do so, agricultural production cooperatives can also be established with leadership and planning. Agricultural production cooperatives spontaneously established by farmers without approval should be carefully checked. Those that basically meet the conditions should be approved immediately; those that do not truly meet the conditions should be reorganized and educated, pointing out the direction and methods for running the cooperatives in the future, and allowing them to try it out; simple and crude methods of cancellation should not be adopted, in order to prevent harming farmers' enthusiasm for taking the socialist road. Active support and leadership should be given to both old and newly established agricultural production cooperatives. All specific measures and policies currently adopted in agricultural production and rural work (technical improvements, issuance of loans, grain procurement and purchase, fixed burdens, etc.) must pay close attention to linking them with the socialist transformation of the small-peasant economy. Only in this way can a new look gradually emerge from the very roots in agricultural production and rural work. In order to implement this work, each county should convene mutual aid and cooperation representative meetings, labor model meetings, or other appropriate meetings before spring plowing to seriously summarize the experience of mutual aid and cooperation and the experience of increasing production, and pass on the experience among the broad masses through the attendees. The North China Bureau plans to convene a large-scale agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation conference in February 1954 to briefly and clearly summarize the experience and lessons of the development of the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement in the North China region over the past few years, inspect the development of agricultural production cooperatives this winter, specifically determine the tasks of the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement and the outline of the Five-Year Plan for 1954, and deploy the 1954 agricultural production increase plan.

Two, in disaster areas, the policy of production for self-salvation must be resolutely implemented, and there must be no slackening in the slightest. All kinds of relief grain funds and production loans must be used well to organize a variety of sideline and handicraft production. In production and disaster relief, supply and marketing cooperatives, banks, commerce, and trade economic departments must all go through their own businesses to help the disaster-stricken masses overcome difficulties, so that loans are timely and supply and sales are smooth.

Three, in order to ensure the victorious completion of next year's grain production increase task, all necessary preparatory work must be done this winter. First, it is necessary to mobilize and organize the broad masses to pay great attention to strengthening the management of wheat fields, and to use winter to repair land, prevent plant diseases and insect pests, and build water conservancy projects under the conditions of need and possibility, and to accumulate and rot various fertilizers in large quantities. Second, in pastoral areas, work must be done well to protect livestock through the winter. In addition, in winter production, the technical guidance departments of agricultural production should seriously summarize and improve farmers' experience in increasing production in order to promote it; technical guidance organizations should be reorganized, and technical personnel should be given the necessary political and technical training so that technical guidance work next year can achieve new and greater achievements.

Four, in order to cooperate with the supply work in the acquisition of grain and support next year's agricultural production increase movement, handicraft production, sideline production, credit work, and material exchange work must be carried out well this winter. In material exchange, the experience of the new exchange form of the business organization meetings held in Taiyuan and Shijiazhuang should be promoted. The characteristics of this exchange form are: great importance is attached to the promotion of handicraft products, and handicraft production cooperatives and unorganized handicraft producers are actively supported through purchase and sales contracts. This can not only appropriately solve the difficulty of insufficient supply of goods, but also directly benefit the socialist transformation of handicrafts.

Five, agricultural loans are an important policy of the state to carry out the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement and help poor farmers develop production. All localities should combine winter production and acquisition work to truly lend loans to mutual aid and cooperation organizations and poor farmers who need assistance, so that they can be organized more smoothly with the help of the state, improve production, and gradually get rid of poverty.

    中共中央华北局发出指示
    确定今冬农村生产工作具体任务
    中共中央华北局在最近发出关于加强农村冬季生产和明年农业增产准备工作的指示。
    指示指出：今年冬季农村工作任务很繁重，也很重要，须要全党努力，在大张旗鼓地宣传并贯彻党在过渡时期的总路线、总任务的前提下，充分发动群众，按期完成各项工作，以迎接第一个五年计划第二年度的到来。指示并指出：在完成这些繁重的工作任务中，存在着许多新的有利的条件，如农业互助合作运动的广泛发展，并已显示出它的优越性；国家工业化事业已开始积极进行，这个事业对于农村工作的影响将会日益加强；党在过渡时期的总路线大大鼓舞了农民对于社会主义的热情和促进农民互助合作的积极性。这些是今后进一步推进农村工作的基本动力。此外，今年冬季农村工作中也存在着任务多和时间短、力量不足的矛盾。解决这一矛盾的关键，在于坚持以生产工作为中心，有计划地调配力量，将生产、互助合作工作，粮食工作，普选工作任务穿插进行。
    指示提出今年冬季农村生产工作有五项具体任务：
    一、开展冬季生产的中心环节，是整顿和发展农业生产合作社和互助组。在积极领导、稳步发展的方针下，争取明年农业生产合作社在一九五三年六千三百个社的基础上，发展一倍或者再多一些，互助组亦应继续发展。在完成这一任务时，必须按照各地不同情况进行工作。在互助组已有相当基础的地区，应以巩固和提高为主，其关键又是确实办好农业生产合作社，以为互助组指出进一步发展的方向（但丝毫也不能忽视或放松对互助组的领导）。在互助组基础较差的地区或空白地区，应有计划有领导地大量发展互助组，同时只要有其他有利条件，如群众愿意办时，也可以有领导有计划地举办农业生产合作社。对农民自发成立未经批准的农业生产合作社，应认真地加以检查，凡基本上够条件的应即予批准；真正不够条件的则加以整理和教育，给其指明今后办社的方向、办法，允许其试办；不可采取简单、粗暴的取消办法，以防止伤害农民走社会主义道路的积极性。不论老的或新成立的农业生产合作社，都应给予积极的支持和领导。目前在农业生产和农村工作中所采取的各项具体措施与政策（技术改进、发放贷款、征粮购粮、固定负担等），必须十分注意和对小农经济实行社会主义改造联系起来。只有这样，才能逐步地从根本上使农业生产和农村工作出现一个新的面貌。为贯彻这一工作，各县应在春耕以前召开互助合作代表会议、劳动模范会议或其他适当的会议，认真地总结互助合作的经验和增加生产的经验，并经过到会人员将经验在广大群众中传播开来。华北局准备在一九五四年二月间召开一次较大规模的农业生产互助合作会议，简要而明确地总结几年来华北区农业生产互助合作运动发展的经验和教训，检查今冬农业生产合作社的发展工作，具体确定明年农业生产互助合作运动的任务及五年计划轮廓，布置一九五四年农业增产计划。
    二、在灾区必须坚决贯彻生产自救的方针，绝不能有丝毫放松。要很好地运用各项救济粮款及生产贷款，组织多种多样的副业和手工业生产。在生产救灾中，供销合作社、银行、商业、贸易各经济部门都须经过自己的业务去扶助受灾群众渡过困难，使贷款及时，供销顺畅。
    三、为了保证明年粮食增产任务的胜利完成，今冬必须做好各项必要的准备工作。首先必须动员和组织广大群众十分注意加强麦田的管理工作，在需要和可能的条件下利用冬季修整土地、预防病虫害、兴修水利等，并大量积沤各种肥料。其次在牧区必须做好保畜过冬工作。此外，在冬季生产中，农业生产的技术指导部门应认真地总结农民增产经验，加以提高，以便推广；应将技术指导机构加以整顿，对技术人员加以必要的政治和技术的训练，使明年的技术指导工作取得新的更大的成就。
    四、为了配合收购粮食中的供应工作及支持明年的农业增产运动，今冬必须很好地开展手工业生产、副业生产、信贷工作及物资交流工作。物资交流中，应推广在太原、石家庄两地召开的业务组织会议的新的交流形式的经验。这种交流形式的特点是：十分重视手工业产品的推销，并经过购销合同积极地扶植手工业生产合作社及未组织起来的手工业生产者。这样不仅可以适当解决货源不足的困难，并直接有利于对手工业的社会主义的改造工作。
    五、农业贷款是国家开展农村互助合作运动和帮助穷困农民发展生产的一项重要政策。各地应结合冬季生产及收购工作，把贷款真正贷给需要扶助的互助合作组织和贫困农民，使他们在国家帮助下更顺利地组织起来，提高生产，逐渐摆脱贫困。
