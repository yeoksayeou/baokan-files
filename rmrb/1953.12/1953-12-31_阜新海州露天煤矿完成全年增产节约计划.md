Respected Chairman Mao:
    As our great motherland is about to enter the second year of the first Five-Year Plan, all employees of our Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine report to you with immense joy and excitement: We have victoriously completed the annual production increase and savings plan for this year.
    Since our Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine was officially handed over to production on "July 1st" this year, we have overfulfilled the production tasks assigned to us by the state every month. The annual raw coal production plan was overfulfilled twenty-one days ahead of schedule on December 10th. On this basis, we again overfulfilled the annual raw coal production increase plan by 0.39% six days ahead of schedule on December 25th. The total value of increased production and savings exceeded the plan by 3.8%, and the stripping and basic construction plans were also overfulfilled simultaneously.
    The reason we achieved this accomplishment is first and foremost due to the wise leadership of you and the great Chinese Communist Party. It is also due to the internationalist assistance of the Soviet government and the direct, selfless help and guidance of Soviet experts. All employees have initially grasped the open-pit production technology knowledge, learned from advanced Soviet experience, and improved the utilization rate of mechanical equipment. Secondly, we responded to the Party's great call, launched a production increase and savings campaign, and fully utilized the creativity of the working class by strengthening planned management and deeply tapping potential, thereby improving labor productivity.
    Now, we are studying the Party's general line and general task during the transition period. Under the glorious light of the general line, we are even more confident. Therefore, we guarantee to you that we will increase the production of raw coal by 30,000 tons and increase the amount of stripping by 150,000 cubic meters by the end of the year, as a gift to welcome the second year of the motherland's first Five-Year Plan, and strive to promote the country's socialist industrialization and gradual transition to socialism!
    With highest respect!
                                                All Employees of Haizhou Open-Pit Coal Mine, Fuxin Mining Bureau

    阜新海州露天煤矿完成全年增产节约计划敬爱的毛主席：
    在我们伟大的祖国即将进入第一个五年建设计划第二年之际，我们海州露天煤矿全体职工，怀着无比欢欣鼓舞的心情，向您报告：我们已经胜利地完成了今年全年增产节约计划。
    我们海州露天煤矿，从今年“七一”正式移交生产以后，逐月超额完成了国家给予我们的生产任务。全年原煤生产计划，已于十二月十日提前二十一天超额完成，在这个基础上，又于十二月二十五日提前六天超额百分之零点三九完成了全年原煤增产计划，增产节约总值超过计划百分之三点八，并同时超额完成了剥土和基本建设计划。
    我们之所以取得这个成就，首先应归功于您和伟大的中国共产党的英明领导。并由于苏联政府的国际主义援助和苏联专家的直接的、无私的帮助和指导，全体职工初步掌握了露天的生产技术知识，学习了苏联先进经验，提高了机械设备运用率；其次，我们响应了党的伟大号召，开展了增产节约竞赛，用加强计划管理、深入挖掘潜力的办法，充分发挥了工人阶级的创造性，从而提高了劳动生产率。
    现在，我们正在学习党在过渡时期的总路线总任务，在总路线的光辉照耀下，我们更加具备信心。因此向您保证：我们到年末再为国家增产原煤三万吨，增产剥土量十五万立方公尺，作为迎接祖国第一个五年建设计划第二年的献礼，为促进国家社会主义工业化和逐步过渡到社会主义而奋斗！
    致以崇高的敬礼！
              阜新矿务局海州露天煤矿全体职工
