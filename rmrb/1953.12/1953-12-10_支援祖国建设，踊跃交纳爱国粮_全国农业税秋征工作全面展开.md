    Supporting National Construction, Enthusiastically Paying Patriotic Grain
    The Nationwide Autumn Agricultural Tax Collection Work is in Full Swing
    The autumn agricultural tax collection work for 1953 has been fully launched across the country. Many regions are in the process of delivering grain to storage, and in a few areas such as Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Sichuan, and Shaanxi provinces, the majority of the public grain has already been stored. "Support the nation's socialist industrialization, enthusiastically pay patriotic grain" has become a resounding slogan among the peasant masses in this year's grain delivery. The local CPC committees and people's governments at all levels attach great importance to this year's agricultural tax collection work. When arranging the agricultural tax collection work, they conscientiously discussed the guidelines and policies for agricultural tax collection based on the general line for the transitional period, criticized the partial view of some cadres who one-sidedly emphasized tasks without regard to policies, and also criticized the one-sided "benevolent government view" that some cadres had once produced during the summer collection. They further clarified the consistency of policies and tasks, and clearly recognized the significant role of collecting agricultural taxes and controlling grain in gradually realizing the nation's socialist industrialization. Various regions also vigorously publicized to the peasants the fair, reasonable, and production-encouraging burden policies of "assessing taxes based on the amount of land cultivated, the amount of grain produced, and legally granting reductions and exemptions, with no increase in taxes for increased production," as well as the State Council's provision that "the agricultural tax collection targets should be stabilized at the level of actual collection in 1952 and not increased for the next three years." This has been supported by the broad masses of peasants. The Northeast region also emphasized the policy publicity to ethnic minorities, requiring relevant regions to translate the collection policies into minority languages, provide popular explanations, and make them known to all. Many regions, in accordance with the State Council's "Instructions on Agricultural Tax Work in 1953," have appropriately adjusted the phenomenon of certain excessively high or low fixed yields before or during this year's autumn collection. In Hunan Province, after the yield adjustment, many peasants eliminated their concerns about developing production. Some peasants said, "The yield is reasonable, and the burden will be fixed. We will be even more motivated to produce in the future!" Some areas, after the adjustment, immediately combined it with the collection work and announced the fixed yield, further encouraging the peasants' enthusiasm for production.

    This year's agricultural tax rates and reduction/exemption methods were adjusted by various regions based on local conditions under the unified guidelines and policies of the central government. Therefore, this year's collection methods are even more adapted to the different economic conditions of various regions. For example, Hebei and Shanxi provinces stipulated different tax rates according to the different regions of their respective provinces. Hebei Province is divided into four categories of regions: 22 catties per mu are levied on the fertile plains; 21 catties on general plains and relatively wealthy semi-mountainous areas; 19 catties on general semi-mountainous areas, some mountainous areas, and coastal saline-alkali areas; and 15.5 catties on a few deep mountainous barren areas and old revolutionary base areas severely damaged by war. Xikang Province and Zhejiang Province appropriately raised the tax threshold in mountainous areas to take care of the production and life of farmers in mountainous areas. Regarding reduction and exemption methods, various regions have made appropriate modifications based on the feedback from farmers. Some areas where social reduction and exemption were too narrow in the past have been appropriately broadened this year. For example, in Hebei Province, the tax amount covered by social reduction and exemption last year accounted for only 0.6% of the total tax amount, while this year the social reduction and exemption target will be increased to about 5%. In order to do a good job in legally granting reductions and exemptions, various regions have conducted in-depth investigations into disaster situations. For example, responsible cadres in Jilin Province personally conducted inspections during the investigation; some provinces conducted five audits of the disaster situation, conducted more in-depth investigations, and laid the foundation for correctly implementing the reduction and exemption policies.

    In terms of grain transportation and storage, leaders at all levels emphasized safe storage. All provinces and cities have appropriately increased the number of grain receiving depots and stations based on the lessons learned from last year's experience, and checked warehouse safety equipment and warehouse capacity, and repaired roads and bridges. Some areas have also set up signs on essential dangerous roads and paths, and assigned special personnel to direct traffic, so that the masses delivering grain to storage can travel safely. Leaders at all levels also educated cadres to do a good job in organizing rural transportation, providing medical care and tea, and strictly prohibiting people and animals that do not meet the conditions, such as the old, weak, sick, and pregnant, from participating in transportation. They also adopted the method of village and grain depot signing contracts for public grain storage, implementing a transportation approval system for collective grain delivery, and overcoming the paralysis of thought among some cadres who emphasized collection but neglected transportation.

    However, some problems still exist in individual areas during the autumn collection, mainly the failure to conscientiously publicize and implement policies. Some let the masses deliver grain first and calculate the tax amount afterward; some are only satisfied with the general completion of the collection task, thus leaving many arrears. Secondly, individual areas are afraid of failing to complete the task, so the reduction and exemption are tightened. However, in some individual areas, due to insufficient policy publicity, the masses have doubts, resulting in the phenomenon of reporting minor disasters as major disasters, and reporting disasters even when there are none. In the transportation and storage of grain, some areas are too hasty and poorly organized, failing to implement the policy of safe storage among the masses, resulting in accidents involving casualties of people and animals. These problems have attracted the attention of the relevant local party and government leaders, and are being checked and corrected.

    Currently, various regions are vigorously publicizing policies, and those who have not conducted in-depth and extensive publicity in the past are also making up for it. They are also organizing forces led by responsible cadres to go deep into districts and villages to check the implementation of policies, dispel the ideological doubts of the masses, correct deviations in reduction and exemption work and grain transportation and storage work, and at the same time educate cadres to be realistic, act in accordance with policies, advance steadily, overcome difficulties, and successfully complete the task. It is expected that the autumn agricultural tax collection work in most areas may be completed earlier than in previous years. (Zhang Haoran)

    支援祖国建设，踊跃交纳爱国粮
    全国农业税秋征工作全面展开
    一九五三年农业税秋征工作，已在全国各地全面展开，许多地区正在送粮入库，少数地区如湖南、湖北、江西、四川、陕西等省公粮已大部入库。“支援国家的社会主义工业化，踊跃交纳爱国粮”已成为农民群众今年交粮中响亮的口号。各地中共党委和人民政府对今年农业税的征收工作均十分重视。在布置农业税的征收工作时，根据国家过渡时期的总路线，认真讨论了农业税征收的方针和政策，批判了部分干部的片面的强调任务不顾政策的观点，同时也批判了个别干部在夏征中一度产生的片面“仁政观点”，进一步明确认识了政策和任务的一致性，明确认识了征收农业税，掌握粮食对于逐步实现国家社会主义工业化的重大作用，各地还大力向农民宣传了“种多少田地，应产多少粮食，依率计征，依法减免，增产不增税”的公平合理、鼓励增产的负担政策，以及政务院关于“今后三年内，农业税的征收指标，应稳定在一九五二年实际征收的水平上，不再增加”的规定。得到了广大农民群众的拥护。东北区并重视了对少数民族的政策宣传，要求有关地区将征收政策翻译成少数民族文字，加以通俗的解释，布告周知。许多地区遵照中央人民政府政务院“关于一九五三年农业税工作的指示”，在今年秋征前或在秋征中，对某些定产畸高畸低的现象作了适当调整。湖南省在产量调整后，许多农民消除了发展生产的顾虑。有的农民说：“产量合理了，负担也要固定了，今后生产更有劲啦！”有些地区经过调整后，即结合征收工作，宣布固定，更鼓励了农民的生产积极性。
    今年的农业税税率和减免办法，是在中央统一的方针政策下，由各地因地制宜进行调整，因而今年的征收办法也就更进一步地适应了各地的不同经济情况。如河北、山西两省即根据各该省的不同地区规定了不同税率。河北省分为四类地区：平原富庶区每负担亩征收二十二斤；一般平原区及较富的半山区二十一斤；一般半山区、少数山区及沿海碱洼地区十九斤；少数深山贫瘠区及受战争摧残严重的老根据地十五斤半。西康省和浙江省的山区，起征点较前作了适当提高，以照顾山区农民的生产和生活。对减免办法，各地根据农民的反映，作了适当修改。过去某些社会减免过窄的地区，今年适当放宽了。如河北省去年社会减免照顾的税额，仅占总税额的千分之六，今年则将社会减免指标增为百分之五左右。各地为了把依法减免工作做好，均深入地调查了灾情。如吉林省负责干部在调查中亲自进行了巡视；有的省对灾情曾作五次审核，作了比较深入的调查，奠定了正确贯彻减免政策的基础。
    在运粮入库方面，各级领导强调安全入库。各省、市均在总结去年经验教训的基础上，适当增设了收粮库、站，并检查了仓库安全设备和仓库容量，修补了道路桥梁；有的地区还在必经的道路险径，设置了标牌，并派专人指挥通行，使送粮入库的群众安全行驶。各级领导并教育干部作好乡村运输力的组织、医疗、茶水招待等工作，严禁老弱、病、孕等不合条件的人、畜参加运输，并采用乡村和粮库订立公粮入库合同的办法，实行启运批准制度集体交粮，克服了某些干部重征收、轻运输的麻痹思想。
    但是个别地区在秋征中，还存在一些问题，主要的是没有认真地宣传和贯彻政策，有的先让群众送粮，事后计算税额；有的仅满足于征收任务的大体完成，因而留下不少尾欠。其次个别地区怕完不成任务，对减免收缩的较紧，但也有个别地区，因政策宣传不够，群众存有疑虑，致有轻灾报重灾，无灾也报灾的现象。在运粮入库中，有些地区由于过于仓促，组织不严，未能把安全入库的方针贯彻到群众中去，以致人畜伤亡事故仍有发生。这些问题已引起有关地方党政领导方面的注意，并正在检查纠正中。
    目前各地正在大力宣传政策，对于过去宣传不深入不广泛者亦正在进行补课，并组织力量由负责干部带领，深入区村检查政策执行情况，解除群众的思想疑虑，纠正减免工作和运粮入库工作中的偏向，同时教育干部要实事求是，按政策办事，稳步前进，克服困难，圆满地完成任务。预计今年大部地区的农业税秋征工作可能比往年提早完成。        （张浩然）
