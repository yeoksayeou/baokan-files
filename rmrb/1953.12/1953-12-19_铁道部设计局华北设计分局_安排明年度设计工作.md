The North China Design Branch of the Ministry of Railways Design Bureau is actively preparing for next year's work. Recently, the design branch held a cadre meeting to discuss next year's tasks. Near several lines designed by the North China Design Branch, some key construction factories and mines are under construction or being prospected; some are waiting for the railway to be completed to transport heavy machinery for factory construction, and some are waiting for the railway to be completed to transport industrial raw materials. The timing of the railway's completion is related to the speed of production of these factories and mines and the speed of national economic construction. The cadres attending the meeting realized the glory and importance of the new line design work and excitedly accepted the 1954 design tasks.

　　The meeting analyzed the concentration of construction forces, the progress of construction, and the connection of construction on each line in the coming period, determined the focus of design force deployment, and arranged the design order. First, it concentrated the main force to complete the design tasks of key lines, and did a good job in supplying design documents for the lines under construction and improving the design work.

　　Currently, the North China Design Branch has handed over all the documents required by each construction unit before January 1954, and has sent engineers and design teams to the construction site to assist the construction units in solving technical problems. After the cadre meeting, each section and team is conveying the 1954 plan, improving the organization, and deploying cadres. The supply department is cleaning and repairing communication, transportation, and measurement equipment and materials according to next year's plan and the opinions of the cadre meeting. Some teams have already started winter training.

    安排明年度设计工作
    铁道部设计局华北设计分局，正积极准备明年度的工作。日前，设计分局召开干部会议，讨论了明年的任务。华北设计分局负责设计的几条线附近，有些重点建设的厂矿已在修建或正在钻探；有的等待铁路修通后运重型机械建厂，有的等待铁路修成后往外运工业原料。铁路修通的早晚，关系着这些厂矿的生产和国家经济建设的快慢。到会干部认识到新线设计工作的光荣和重大，兴奋地接受了一九五四年的设计任务。
　　会议分析了今后一个时期内施工力量集结的情况、施工进展情况和各线施工衔接情况，确定了设计力量使用的重点，安排了设计次序，首先集中主要力量完成重点线的设计任务，并做好正在施工线路的设计文件供应及改善设计的工作。
　　目前，华北设计分局已经把各施工单位一九五四年一月以前所需的文件全部交出，并派了工程师和设计小组到工地协助施工单位解决技术问题。干部会议结束后，各科、队正在传达一九五四年计划，健全组织，调配干部。供应部门正根据明年计划和干部会议的意见，清理和修配通信、运输、测量用的机具、材料。有的队已经开始冬训。
