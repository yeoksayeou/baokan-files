Xinhua News Agency, December 21st:

    Southeast Asian countries' public opinion continues to condemn the US-Pakistan military alliance. According to the Indian News Service, the "Ceylon Observer" wrote: "For Ceylon and its Southeast Asian neighbors, the most disturbing news at present is that the US and Pakistan will undoubtedly sign a military treaty in the near future."

    The Indonesian Masjumi Party's newspaper "Abadi" pointed out the reactions of India, China, and the Soviet Union to the US-Pakistan negotiations, and wrote: "We want to ask the Pakistani authorities to pay attention: it would be very unwise if they ignore the reactions of their Asian neighbors." The newspaper expressed its support for Prime Minister Nehru's opinion, and said: "The US-Pakistan military treaty will not only worsen the relations between India and Pakistan (which will have serious consequences for the Kashmir dispute), but will also damage Pakistan's relations with those countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East that do not want to be dragged into the Cold War."

    The "Rangoon Burmese Daily" published an editorial saying: "The rumored US-Pakistan military alliance cannot but make Burma uneasy." The newspaper called on Pakistan to "cooperate closely with other Asian countries" and not to "be dragged into a military alliance with the United States."

    东南亚各国舆论继续谴责美巴军事同盟
    【新华社二十一日讯】东南亚国家舆论继续谴责美巴军事同盟。据印度新闻处消息：“锡兰观察家报”写道：“对锡兰和它的东南亚邻国来说，目前最令人不安的消息是，美巴两国无疑将于最近签订军事条约。”
    印尼马斯友美党机关报“永恒报”指出印度、中国和苏联对美巴谈判的反应，并写道：“我们要请巴基斯坦当局注意一下：如果他们忽视亚洲邻国的反应的话，那就太不聪明了。”该报表示支持尼赫鲁总理的意见，并说：“美巴军事条约不仅会使印度和巴基斯坦的关系恶化（这会给克什米尔纠纷造成严重后果），并且还会损害巴基斯坦与东南亚和中东的那些不愿被拖入冷战的国家的关系。”
    “仰光缅甸人报”发表社论说：“传说中的美巴军事同盟不能不使缅甸感到不安。”该报要求巴基斯坦“和亚洲其他国家紧密合作”，不要“被拖进与美国的军事同盟中去”。
