(Xinhua News Agency, December 13th) One million people in Beijing have been educated on the General Line. From mid-November, more than 600 responsible cadres and reporters from various departments of the Beijing Party and government began to directly report to people from all walks of life in the city about the General Line. Large-scale report meetings were held for a week. Those who listened to the reports included workers from state-owned and local state-owned factories, state-owned trade systems, cooperative systems, joint state-private enterprises, and private enterprises, railway employees, construction workers on various construction sites, porters and handicraftsmen, cadres and some farmers in suburban rural areas, teachers from primary and secondary schools, students from universities and middle schools, activists from residential areas, and private industrialists and merchants.

Inspired by the General Line for the nation's construction during the transition period, the working enthusiasm of the broad masses of people in Beijing has been greatly increased. Workers in state-owned industrial and mining enterprises and construction sites have pledged to practice increased production and thrift, and to overfulfill production plans. Many veteran workers and technicians have expressed their desire to further integrate technology with labor and theory with experience in order to better complete the task of national socialist industrialization. Many factories, such as the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, and the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant, have formed a upsurge in learning science and technology and further expanding labor competitions, and new production records are constantly emerging. For example, the screw pad production efficiency of the Guo Qi group at the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory increased by 30% compared to before the promotion of the General Line. The work efficiency of plasterers in the construction of roofs on a certain construction site increased by more than two and a half times compared to before the promotion of the General Line. Many employees of private enterprises have expressed their desire to actively produce and supervise capitalists. Some employees of factories accepting state processing orders have improved the quality of their products and reported the illegal activities of capitalists. The manager of a cooperative distribution office in the Dongsi District, after listening to the report on the General Line, corrected his idea of ​​underestimating commerce and automatically increased the sales quota of the distribution office for the fourth quarter of this year. After being educated on the General Line, farmers in Zhangguozhuang, Fengtai District, sold more than 40,000 catties of surplus grain to the state within two days, exceeding the original purchase plan of the village's supply and marketing cooperative. Many university professors and primary and secondary school teachers in Beijing have expressed their desire to do a good job in teaching and actively cultivate talents for socialist construction.

The Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently held a propaganda work conference, which determined that promoting the General Line will be the regular work in the future. The conference pointed out that, at present, in addition to continuing to carry out universal propaganda in suburban rural areas, the Party organizations in factories, mines, government departments, organizations, and schools should earnestly lead the systematic study of the General Line for the national transition period, and integrate the General Line into the regular political education of Party members and members of the Communist Youth League, and to repeatedly and deeply propagate the General Line to the masses in combination with various tasks such as the general election and increased production and thrift.

    北京一百万人受到总路线的教育
    【新华社十三日讯】北京已有一百万人受到总路线的教育。十一月中旬，北京市党和政府各部门的负责干部和报告员六百多人开始直接向全市各界人民作有关总路线的报告。大型的报告会连续进行了一周，听到报告的有全市国营和地方国营工厂、国营贸易系统、合作社系统、公私合营企业以及私营企业的职工，铁路员工，各工地的建筑工人，搬运工人和手工业者，郊区农村干部及部分农民，大中小学校教师，大中学校学生，居民积极分子和私营工商业者等。
    北京市广大人民在过渡时期国家建设的总路线的鼓舞下，工作热情更加高涨。国营工矿企业和建筑工地的工人，纷纷保证要厉行增产节约，超额完成生产计划。不少老工人和技术人员表示要使技术与劳动、理论与经验进一步地结合起来，以便更好地完成国家社会主义工业化的任务。石景山钢铁厂、长辛店机车车辆修理工厂、北京第一机床厂等许多工厂已形成学习科学技术和进一步扩展劳动竞赛的热潮，生产上的新纪录不断涌现。例如长辛店机车车辆修理工厂郭起小组生产螺丝垫效率比宣传总路线以前提高了百分之三十。某建筑工地的抹灰工人抹屋顶的工作效率比宣传总路线以前提高了两倍半以上。许多私营企业职工表示要积极生产，并监督资本家。一些接受国家加工订货的工厂的职工提高了产品的质量，并检举了资本家的违法行为。东四区一个合作社分销处的经理，在听了总路线报告后，纠正了自己轻视商业的思想，自动提高了分销处今年第四季度的销货定额。丰台区张郭庄农民在受到总路线教育后，两天内卖给国家的余粮达四万多斤，超过了该村供销合作社原来的收购计划。北京市许多大学教授、中小学教师表示要搞好教学工作，积极地培养社会主义建设人材。
    中共北京市委宣传部最近举行了宣传工作会议，确定将宣传总路线作为今后的经常工作。这次会议指出：目前除郊区农村继续进行普遍的宣传外，党在各厂矿、机关、团体、学校的组织要认真领导对国家过渡时期总路线的系统学习，要将总路线贯穿到对党员、团员的经常的政治教育中去，要结合普选、增产节约等各项工作向人民群众进行反复的深入的宣传。
