    [This Newspaper Reports] Thanks to the intense labor of the broad masses of workers and staff, many state-owned, locally state-owned, and joint state-private factories and mines across the country have completed their annual production plans or increased production and economized plans ahead of schedule during the first year of the Five-Year Plan. According to incomplete statistics, by December 15th, 185 factories and mines in the Northeast region had completed their annual production plans ahead of schedule; by the end of November, 205 in the North China region; and by December 22nd, 51 factories and mines and nine transportation units in the Southwest region. By December 20th, 107 factories and mines in Shanghai had completed their annual plans for output value, profit delivery, or increased production and economization; by December 22nd, 52 of the 72 factories under the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Local Industry had completed their annual production tasks. In addition, many enterprises in Tianjin, Shenyang, Harbin, Chongqing, Xi'an, Wuhan, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Kunming and other cities have also overfulfilled their annual plans.
    The early completion of production tasks by many factories and mines has played a significant role in accelerating national industrial construction and ensuring the needs of the people's lives. Anshan Iron and Steel this year has completed the ordering tasks of more than 1,000 units across the country. The supply of steel, pig iron, and other products to all parts of the country this year has exceeded twelve times that of 1949, an increase of 40% compared to last year. The steel rails produced by the Southwest 101 Steel Plant this year have been continuously supplied to the construction needs of new railways and factories and mines in Northeast China, North China, Inner Mongolia, Central South China, and East China, playing a significant role, especially in the construction of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, the major artery connecting the Southwest and Northwest. The steel rails produced by the plant this year can lay more than 2,000 kilometers of railway, equivalent to the length of four Chengdu-Chongqing railways. The gasoline produced by Lushun-Dalian No. 7 Petroleum Factory this year can supply 1,700 trucks with a carrying capacity of four tons for one year, and the kerosene produced can supply 1.2 million farmers with lighting fuel for one year. Kailuan Coal Mine, one of the largest coal mines in China, completed its annual coal production plan nine days ahead of schedule, and the cost of coal was reduced by 6.26% compared to the plan. The planned output completed this year accounts for more than one-tenth of the country's total coal output. In addition to supplying Anshan Iron and Steel for coking, the coal is also supplied for industrial fuel in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, Nanjing, Qingdao, and other places, and some is exported abroad. Now all employees are full of confidence and are striving to achieve the goal of increasing production and economizing 71 billion yuan this year. Shanghai's 19 state-owned cotton textile mills have all completed their annual cotton yarn and cotton cloth output plans eight or nine days ahead of schedule; the four state-owned printing and dyeing factories completed their annual production plans sixteen days ahead of schedule. Before the end of the year, each cotton textile mill is expected to produce an additional 18,000 bales of cotton yarn and more than 350,000 bolts of cloth; the four printing and dyeing factories are expected to produce extra colored and patterned cloth enough for more than 2.9 million people to make a set of clothes each. In mid-December, the state-owned Northwest No. 1 Cotton Textile Mill, Shaanxi Cotton Textile Mill No. 2, the state-owned Tongchuan Coal Mine, and Shaanxi Daan Asbestos Mine continued to complete their annual national production plans ahead of schedule in the Shaanxi region; in the Gansu region, there were the local state-owned Lanzhou Power Plant, Shimengou Coal Mine, Shajinyi Brick and Tile Factory, and Northwest Wool Textile Factory. The workers and staff of these factories and mines are continuing to tap potential and increase more wealth for the country. The workers and staff of the state-owned Northwest No. 1 Cotton Textile Mill proposed to increase the production of 2,400 bales of cotton yarn and 48,000 bolts of cotton cloth for the country by the end of the year.
    Many factories and mines have completed their profit delivery plans ahead of schedule, accumulating huge amounts of funds for national industrial construction. Shanghai's 30 state-owned textile and printing and dyeing factories completed their annual profit delivery plan two months ahead of schedule with a surplus of 40%, and it is expected that an additional 305.8 billion yuan in net profit can be added by the end of the year. If the profits obtained from the over-planned production of these 30 factories this year are used as basic construction funds, two yarn factories with 50,000 spindles each can be newly built. The Hunan Provincial State-owned Xikuangshan Mining Bureau completed its annual production and financial plans ahead of schedule on December 4th, and the delivered profits are equivalent to all the funds needed to build another enterprise of the same scale as the bureau. The East China Iron and Steel Company overfulfilled the profit delivery plan in the increased production and economization plan on December 17th. This batch of delivered profits can be used to build a steel rolling factory of the same scale as the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company No. 2 Factory.
    This year, in industrial production, the broad masses of workers and staff have given full play to their high level of enthusiasm and creativity and have made great contributions. From January to October, 874 workers, technicians, staff, and management cadres of the Anshan Iron and Steel Bow Ridge Mine proposed 763 rationalization proposals, of which 484 have been adopted. Due to the implementation of these proposals, 2.77 billion yuan of wealth has been created for the country. The workers and staff of Dalian Crane Factory actively looked for tricks in increasing production and saving money, and by mid-November, they had solved 43 key problems, which greatly improved the quality of products. The workers and staff of the Kunming Railway Administration actively promoted Sun Shigui's firing method and thermal measures in the locomotive department, which reduced the coal consumption per 10,000-ton kilometers from an average of 1,098 kilograms in 1952 to an average of 802 kilograms in the first eleven months of this year, saving the country 1 billion yuan for the whole year.
    Now, workers and staff in factories, mines, and transportation enterprises across the country are continuing to work hard to produce, actively preparing for the 1954 production and welcoming the new tasks of the second year of the country's first Five-Year Plan.

    许多厂矿完成全年计划
    对保证国家建设和人民需要起了巨大作用
    【本报讯】在五年计划的第一个年度中，由于广大职工紧张的劳动，全国各地许多国营、地方国营和公私合营厂矿，都提前完成了全年生产计划或增产节约计划。据不完全的统计，提前完成全年生产计划的厂矿，东北区到十二月十五日已有一百八十五个；华北区到十一月底已有二百零五个；西南区到十二月二十二日已有五十一个厂矿和九个交通运输单位。到十二月二十日，上海市已有一百零七个厂矿完成了全年产值、上缴利润或增产节约的计划；到十二月二十二日，北京市地方工业局所属七十二个工厂中已有五十二个完成了全年生产任务。此外，天津、沈阳、哈尔滨、重庆、西安、武汉、南京、广州、昆明等城市也有很多企业超额完成了全年计划。
    许多厂矿提前完成生产任务，对加速国家工业建设和保证人民生活需要起了很大的作用。鞍钢今年已完成了全国一千多个单位的订货任务，今年供给全国各地的钢材、生铁等产品超过一九四九年的十二倍，比去年增加了百分之四十。西南一零一钢铁厂今年生产的钢轨，源源不断地供应了东北、华北、内蒙古、中南、华东等地新建铁路和厂矿建设的需要，特别对沟通西南和西北的大动脉——宝成铁路的修建，起了重大的作用。该厂今年生产的钢轨可铺设铁路两千多公里，相当于四条成渝路的长度。旅大第七石油厂今年增产的汽油可供一千七百辆载重四吨的卡车使用一年，增产的煤油可供一百二十万户农民一年作照明燃料用。我国产量最大的煤矿之一——开滦煤矿提前九天完成全年产煤计划，煤的成本比计划降低百分之六点二六。今年完成的计划产量约占到全国产煤量十分之一以上。这些煤除一部分供应鞍山钢铁公司炼焦用外，并供应北京、天津、上海、武汉、南京、青岛等地工业燃用，部分并输出到国外。现在全体职工正满怀信心地为达到今年增产节约七百一十亿元的目标而奋斗。上海十九个国营棉纺织厂已全部提前八天或九天完成了今年全年的棉纱和棉布产量计划；四个国营印染厂提前十六天完成了全年的生产计划。在年底以前，各棉纺织厂预计还可以生产一万八千件棉纱和三十五万多匹布；四个印染厂预计还可以额外增产足供二百九十多万人每人做一套衣服的色布和花布。在十二月中旬，陕西地区继续提前完成全年国家生产计划的有国营西北第一棉纺织厂、陕西棉纺织厂二厂、国营铜川煤矿、陕西大安石棉矿等；甘肃地区有地方国营兰州发电厂、石门沟煤矿、沙金驿砖瓦厂、西北毛纺厂等。这些厂矿企业的职工正在继续挖掘潜在力，为国家增产更多的财富。国营西北第一棉纺织厂职工提出要到年底再给国家增产棉纱二千四百件，增产棉布四万八千匹。
    许多厂矿提前完成了上缴利润计划，为国家工业建设积累了巨量的资金。上海三十个国营纺织、印染厂提前两个月超额百分之四十完成了全年上缴利润计划，预计到年底还可多增加纯利润三千零五十八亿元。如果把这三十个厂今年超计划增产所得的利润作为基本建设资金，可新建两个五万纱锭的纱厂。湖南省国营锡矿山矿务局在十二月四日提前完成了全年生产、财务计划，上缴的利润相当于再建设一个和该局同样规模的企业所需的全部资金。华东钢铁公司在十二月十七日超额完成了增产节约计划中的上缴利润计划。这批上缴利润，可新建一个像上海钢铁公司第二厂同样规模的轧钢工厂。
    今年在工业生产中，广大职工发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，作出了巨大的贡献。鞍钢弓长岭矿从一月至十月，有八百七十四个工人、技术人员、职员和管理干部提出了七百六十三件合理化建议，已经被采用的有四百八十四件。由于这些建议的实行，给国家创造了二十七亿七千多万元的财富。大连起重机器厂职工，在增产节约中积极找窍门，到十一月中旬已解决了四十三个关键问题，大大提高了产品质量。昆明铁路管理局职工在机务方面积极推行了孙士贵焚火法及热力措施，使万吨公里耗煤由一九五二年的平均一零九八公斤，降低到今年十一个月平均八零二公斤，全年可为国家节约十亿元。
    现在，全国各地厂矿和交通运输企业职工正继续努力生产，积极进行一九五四年生产准备工作，迎接国家第一个五年计划第二个年度的新任务。
