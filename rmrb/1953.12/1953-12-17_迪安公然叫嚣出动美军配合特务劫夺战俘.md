Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 15th: Our correspondent reports: U.S. representative Dean has signaled to Syngman Rhee that he should sabotage the Korean Armistice Agreement on January 22nd, forcibly seize the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war in Dongchang-ri, and openly stated that he will assist with U.S. troops.

After Dean unilaterally interrupted the bilateral talks on the political conference issue, on the 13th, he claimed that "prisoners of war must be released completely according to the timetable." Then, on the 14th, Dean said to U.S. soldiers in Munsan that U.S. troops would be stationed south of the demilitarized zone in January to "ensure" that prisoners of war receive so-called "release." He said that U.S. troops will "receive" the prisoners of war and provide them with transportation when they enter South Korea on January 22nd, the U.S.'s so-called "deadline." Dean also said: "There are currently 22,000 prisoners of war in the demilitarized zone. By January 22nd, there may not be a single prisoner of war left."

Coordinating with Dean's provocative remarks, the Syngman Rhee clique in Seoul and the Chiang Kai-shek remnants in Taipei are also stepping up their clamor and preparations for forcibly detaining prisoners of war. Syngman Rhee's Foreign Minister, Pyun Yung-tai, followed Dean and clamored that the prisoners of war in Dongchang-ri would be "automatically" "handed over" to the U.S. military command on January 22nd. At the same time, an International News Service report from Taipei on the 14th revealed that the concentration camp built by the Chiang Kai-shek remnants in Taiwan to detain more than 10,000 Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war is nearing completion, and various arrangements for transporting them from Korea to Taiwan have also been prepared.

Outside the prisoner of war camp in Dongchang-ri, the U.S. side is frantically clamoring and preparing. Inside the prisoner of war camp in Dongchang-ri, U.S. special agents are also carrying out large-scale preparations for seizing prisoners of war. According to reports from Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who recently broke through special agent control and were repatriated, after the Korean and Chinese side's explanation work in Dongchang-ri was forced to stop, the special agent leaders in the camp held a meeting to discuss the plan to seize prisoners of war and made preparations in various aspects. In some camps, U.S. special agents clamored that "the explanation work is over" and forced the prisoners of war to pack their luggage and practice packing, preparing psychologically for "escape." In some camps, U.S. special agents established "staff headquarters" for riots and escapes, organized "military police" and other special agent armed forces to coerce prisoners of war to leave the camp, and forced prisoners of war to form groups according to combat requirements. U.S. special agents are also forcing prisoners of war to rush to manufacture weapons for use when escaping from the camp. In some camps, Syngman Rhee's special agents are forcing prisoners of war to fill out "registration forms," guaranteeing that they will join Syngman Rhee's puppet army after "escaping."

The U.S. side's conspiracy to seize prisoners of war by force, both internally and externally, has been planned for a long time. After the Korean armistice, the U.S. side made arrangements even before the prisoners of war arrived at the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission's custody camp. According to revelations from our captured personnel who returned, when they were still in the U.S. prisoner of war camps in Busan and Jeju Island, the Kuomintang and Syngman Rhee bandit gangs' special agents in the prisoner of war camps obtained maps of the Indian troops' custody camp from the U.S. side, including the deployment of nearby U.S. military positions. These returnees heard a speech by an American general at the end of August and the beginning of September this year. The general asked the prisoners of war to break out of the Indian troops' custody camp if necessary, and told them that the U.S. military had deployed strong positions near the Indian camp in preparation for receiving them. Now, special agents are actively preparing to coerce prisoners of war to escape from the camp, and on the other hand, they are actively massacring prisoners of war who request repatriation. In camp number 38 alone, the bodies of four people who had been brutally murdered were found overnight. Dean's clamor to use U.S. troops to receive Syngman Rhee's seizure of prisoners of war only proves that U.S. diplomat Dean, who wears white gloves, is in fact an accomplice of the U.S. special agents who have stained their hands with the blood of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war.

The U.S. side's conspiracy to seize prisoners of war by force has now been completely exposed. The reason why the U.S. side is trying to forcibly detain prisoners of war by such unscrupulous means is because the U.S. side's dark secrets of persecuting prisoners of war and sabotaging the explanation work have been revealed, and the U.S. side has suffered a heavy political and moral defeat. In order to avoid the political conference and attempt to mitigate this defeat, the U.S. side does not hesitate to interrupt the bilateral talks on the political conference issue, so that Syngman Rhee can freely sabotage the Korean Armistice Agreement and realize this conspiracy to forcibly detain prisoners of war. This act of playing with fire by the U.S. side is clearly a serious challenge to the world's people's desire for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.

### 迪安公然叫嚣出动美军配合特务劫夺战俘

    迪安公然叫嚣出动美军配合特务劫夺战俘
   【新华社开城十五日电】本社特派记者报道：美国代表迪安已经向李承晚发出了信号，要他在一月二十二日破坏朝鲜停战协定，武力劫夺东场里的朝中被俘人员，并且公开表示将以美国军队来加以协助。
    迪安在片面中断了关于政治会议问题的双方会谈以后，在十三日声称“战俘一定要完全按照时间表予以释放”。接着，在十四日，迪安又在汶山对美军士兵说：美军在明年一月里将在非军事区以南布置军队，以“保证”战俘获得所谓“释放”。他说，美军部队在明年一月二十二日美方所谓“限期”那天，在战俘进入南朝鲜时，将“收容”他们，并供应他们以交通工具。迪安并说：“在非军事区现在共有二万二千名战俘。到明年一月二十二日时，可能一个战俘都不会有了。”
    配合着迪安这种挑衅性的言论，汉城的李承晚集团和台北的蒋介石残匪也在加紧进行着强迫扣留战俘的叫嚣和准备。李承晚集团的外务部长官卞荣泰紧跟在迪安后面叫嚷说，东场里的战俘将在一月二十二日“自动”被“移交”给美军司令部。同时国际新闻社台北十四日电透露，台湾蒋介石残匪为拘禁一万多名中国人民志愿军被俘人员而建筑的集中营已接近完成，把他们从朝鲜运往台湾的各种安排也已经就绪。
    在东场里战俘营外面，美方这样拚命叫嚣和准备。在东场里战俘营里面，美方特务们也在大规模地进行着劫夺战俘的准备活动。据最近突破特务控制遣返归来的朝中被俘人员报告说：在东场里朝中方面的解释工作被迫停顿以后，营场里的特务头子开会讨论了劫夺战俘计划，并进行了各方面的准备工作。在有些营场中，美方特务们叫嚷说“解释工作已经完蛋”，并强迫战俘们整理行装，作打背包的演习，为“逃跑”做心理准备。在有些营场中，美方特务们成立了暴动越营的“参谋部”，组织了“宪兵队”等胁迫战俘离营的特务武装，并按照作战要求迫使战俘编组。美方特务并正强迫战俘赶造武器，准备越营时使用。在有的营场，李承晚特务并强迫战俘填写“登记表”，保证“逃跑”后参加李承晚伪军。
    美方里应外合地用武力劫夺战俘的阴谋，是策划已久了的。在朝鲜停战以后，在战俘还未到达中立国遣返委员会看管营地以前，美方即进行了布置。据归来的我方被俘人员揭露，当他们还在釜山和济州岛美方战俘营中时，战俘营中的国民党和李承晚匪帮的特务，就都从美方得到了印度部队看管营地的地图，其中包括附近美军阵地的部署。这些归来人员在今年八月底到九月初都曾听过一个美国将军的训话，这个将军要战俘们在必要时冲出印度部队看管营地，并且告诉他们说，美军已在印度营地附近布下强大阵地，准备接应他们。现在，特务们一方面积极准备胁迫战俘越营，另一方面又正在积极屠杀要求遣返的战俘。仅仅在三十八号营场，在一夜之间就发现四个被惨杀者的尸体。迪安现在所发出的用美国军队接应李承晚劫夺战俘的叫嚣，只不过证明了戴着白手套的美国外交家迪安，原来和那些双手染满朝中被俘人员的鲜血的美方特务是不折不扣的同谋。
    美方用武力劫夺战俘的阴谋，现在已经彻底暴露。美方所以企图这样不择手段地强迫扣留战俘，是因为美方使用各种卑鄙手段迫害战俘及破坏解释工作的黑幕已被揭发，美方已在政治上及道义上遭到惨重的失败。为了逃避政治会议来妄图减轻这种失败，美方不惜中断关于政治会议问题的双方会谈，以便李承晚得以放手地破坏朝鲜停战协定，实现这个强迫扣留战俘的阴谋。美方这种玩火的行为，显然是对世界人民要求和平解决朝鲜问题的愿望的严重挑战。
