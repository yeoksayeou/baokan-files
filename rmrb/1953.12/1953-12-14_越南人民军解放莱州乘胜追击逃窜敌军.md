Xinhua News Agency, December 13th: A communiqué issued on the 12th by the Vietnam News Agency states that the Vietnamese People's Army liberated Lai Châu, the capital of Lai Châu province in northwestern Vietnam, on the 11th, and is pursuing a portion of the enemy troops retreating from Lai Châu on the mountain road between Lai Châu and Điện Biên Phủ.

After rapidly traversing the 200-kilometer-long highway from Sơn La to Lai Châu, the Vietnamese People's Army entered the capital of Lai Châu province on the morning of December 11th. This is the first time the Vietnamese People's Army has met with the residents of Lai Châu province since the French colonialists invaded Vietnam.

The capital of Lai Châu province was defended by a Franco-African battalion of the French army and more than 2,000 puppet troops commanded by the French army. Under the severe threat of the People's Army, the enemy forces were unable to hold out stubbornly and began airlifting their officers and Franco-African troops to Hanoi on December 8th. The French colonialists thought they would have time to withdraw the remaining troops to Điện Biên Phủ, but the Vietnamese People's Army's rapid offensive disrupted the enemy's retreat plan. On the 10th, when the People's Army opened fire on the banks of the Nậm Pồ River south of Lai Châu, four companies of enemy troops stationed at the Kla Vo Gorge and more than three companies of garrison troops in Lai Châu city fled in panic to the western mountains.

Now, on the mountain road between Lai Châu and Điện Biên Phủ, the People's Army is pursuing these 2,000 enemy troops retreating from Lai Châu and has already engaged in fierce fighting with a batch of enemy troops west of Lai Châu who were the last to escape from Lai Châu. The fighting is still ongoing.

Xinhua News Agency, December 13th: The defeat of the French invading army, which was forced to hastily withdraw from Lai Châu, an isolated stronghold in northwestern Vietnam, once again demonstrates the weakness of the French forces in Vietnam.

After the French invading army's surprise attack on Điện Biên Phủ on November 20th, the French authorities, through news agencies in France, the United States, and other countries, loudly boasted that one of the main purposes of the surprise attack on Điện Biên Phủ was to "block" the threat of the Vietnamese People's Army to the French army's Lai Châu stronghold and that it was the "prelude to a major offensive" by the French army in northwestern Vietnam. However, not long after, these news agencies reported anxiously that the Vietnamese People's Army had inserted itself into the area between Lai Châu and Điện Biên Phủ and was advancing towards Lai Châu and Điện Biên Phủ along multiple routes. On the 8th, the Associated Press reported that the Vietnamese People's Army attacking Lai Châu was "irresistible." Therefore, the French garrison, with nowhere to retreat, hurriedly climbed onto airplanes and retreated from the air.

General Cogny, the French Commander-in-Chief of the French forces in North Vietnam, concealed the failure of the French forces' forced withdrawal from Lai Châu on the 11th in Hanoi, saying that the withdrawal from Lai Châu had been decided "four months ago." However, French spokesmen had repeatedly boasted in recent days: "The strength of the French Federal forces stationed in Lai Châu has been increased in order to deal with the offensive that the Viet Minh forces may launch soon"; the French forces are "determined to maintain control of Lai Châu" and will never withdraw, etc.

Lai Châu is one of only two isolated strongholds occupied by the French army in northwestern Vietnam. After the French forces withdrew from Lai Châu, they felt deeply uneasy about the fate of the remaining isolated stronghold of Điện Biên Phủ. Agence France-Presse quoted French military headquarters as saying that Điện Biên Phủ is now "becoming the focus of the Viet Minh's offensive." The report also said that air transport is underway between Hanoi and Điện Biên Phủ to ensure the supply of arms, food, and reinforcements.

    越南人民军解放莱州乘胜追击逃窜敌军
    【新华社十三日讯】据越南通讯社讯：十二日发表的公报说：越南人民军在十一日解放了位于越南西北部的莱州省省会——莱州，并正在莱州至奠边府间的山路上追击由莱州撤退的一部分敌军。
    越南人民军在迅速通过由山萝通往莱州的二百公里长的公路后，在十二月十一日早上进入莱州省会。这是越南人民军自法国殖民者侵略越南以来第一次和莱州省会的居民会见。
    莱州省会由法军的一个欧非营和由法军指挥的二千多名伪军防守着。敌军在受到人民军严重威胁的情况下，无法负隅顽抗，在十二月八日开始把他们的军官和欧非籍部队空运撤到河内。法国殖民者以为他们还来得及把余下的军队撤到奠边府，然而越南人民军神速的进攻打乱了敌军的撤退计划。十日，当人民军在莱州省会以南的南目河边一开火，驻扎在克拉沃峡路的敌军四个连和莱州城的守军三个多连即仓皇向西部山区逃窜。
    现在，在莱州和奠边府之间的山路上，人民军正在追击这些由莱州撤退的二千名敌军，并已经在莱州西面和最后逃出莱州的一批敌军发生激战，战斗还在进行中。
    【新华社十三日讯】法国侵略军被迫从越南西北孤立据点莱州省会慌忙撤走的败绩，再次说明侵越法军实力的脆弱。
    当侵越法军在十一月二十日偷袭奠边府之后，法军当局曾通过法美等国通讯社大肆吹嘘说，偷袭奠边府的主要目的之一是“挡住”越南人民军对法军莱州据点的威胁，并且是法军对越南西北地区“大进攻的序幕”。但是，没有多久之后，这些通讯社就惶惶不安地报道越南人民军已插到莱州与奠边府之间的地区并分路向莱州和奠边府推进的消息。合众社八日报道说：向莱州进攻的越南人民军
  “势如破竹”。因此，无路可退的法国守军就慌忙爬上飞机从空中撤逃。
    侵越法军北越总司令戈湼十一日在河内掩饰法军被迫撤出莱州的失败说，莱州的撤退在“四个月之前”即已决定。但是法军的发言人几天以来还在一再吹嘘：“驻在莱州的法兰西联邦军队的兵力已经增强，以便对付看来越盟军队很快就可能发动的进攻”；法军“决心要保持对莱州的控制权”，决不撤走等等。
    莱州是法军在越南西北部侵占的仅有的两个孤立据点之一。法军撤出莱州后，对剩下的另外一个孤立据点奠边府的命运深深感到不安。法新社引法军司令部的消息说，奠边府现在“已成为越盟进攻的焦点了”。消息并说，河内与奠边府之间正在进行空运，以便保证武装、粮食和援军的供应。
