Learning from the Outstanding Art Educator, Mr. Xu Beihong
Jiang Feng

Our art community's respected Mr. Xu Beihong was not only an outstanding painter but also an outstanding art educator. He made significant contributions to the growth and development of China's art education. Mr. Xu's most important contribution to art education was his consistent advocacy and insistence on rigorous sketching practice and a realistic spirit faithful to the object in art teaching. Starting from this requirement, he established relatively scientific training methods in his long-term practice, thus cultivating many art workers with practical skills. This prepared excellent conditions and laid a solid foundation for the development of Chinese art education, both in terms of faculty and training methods.

Mr. Xu attached great importance to sketching exercises in teaching, emphasizing that sketching practice is the most important subject for cultivating artists. His purpose was to enable learners to master correct realistic methods and skilled realistic techniques through sketching practice. Mr. Xu believed that only in this way could creation reach the level of mastery. This view can be proven correct from his own artistic practice. Taking his Chinese painting creation as an example, he was able to break through traditional formats and themes, get rid of the general Chinese painters' habit of adhering to old methods and imitating the ancients, and engage in faithful depictions of real things, creating works with correct and vivid images, full of realism, and with a unique style. This is obviously inseparable from his high level of sketching skills. The position of sketching in art education is like the foundation work of building a house. If the foundation is not solid, the house cannot be built or built well. This is the reason why Mr. Xu attached importance to sketching exercises.

Mr. Xu required that sketching exercises must be faithful to the description of the object. This was not advocating the method of "drawing a gourd according to the pattern." He always firmly opposed this kind of naturalistic method. Mr. Xu has always believed that the concept of being faithful to the description of the object requires, in addition to the accurate proportion, light and dark, outline, anatomy, etc. of the object, more importantly, the characteristics of the object should be expressed through the description of these phenomena. In order to achieve this requirement, he advocated observing the object "to the finest detail" and expressing the object "to the broadest extent" in the process of guiding students to paint. This means that the painter is required to observe the object carefully, and according to his understanding of the object, to make choices and generalizations from the complex phenomena of the object, find its laws, and grasp its general form, so as to make the characteristics of the object stand out, in order to achieve a simple and rich effect. In order to prevent students from using their eyes but not their brains when painting, Mr. Xu emphasized the "silent painting" homework of exercising memory. It can be seen that the concept of being faithful to the description of the object that Mr. Xu said has rich content, and it is consistent with the requirements of the realistic art method.

Mr. Xu believed that there was no other shortcut to obtaining proficient realistic techniques except for diligent study and hard practice based on his own experience. Therefore, he asked students to paint more, strictly stipulated the amount of homework inside and outside the classroom, and required "honesty" in learning attitude, and opposed taking chances and empty talk. In order to encourage students to develop a habit of diligence in art learning, he often said to them: To be an artist with real skills, you must have the perseverance of "never leaving your fist and never leaving your song."

If we recall the chaotic situation of general art education in the old China period, the superiority of Mr. Xu's educational propositions and teaching methods will be more obvious. In the old era, most art educators, influenced by Western European formalism art, neglected rigorous sketching exercises and realistic style in teaching, advocated so-called "individual freedom," but in fact, they were letting students arbitrarily smear the picture and encouraging students to develop the habit of being lazy and opportunistic, thus the future of many talented young artists was delayed. At that time, the shortcomings of Chinese painting teaching were also obvious. Students were trained almost in the old method of copying according to manuscripts. As a result, students were trained to become "Chinese painters" who only knew how to imitate their predecessors and could only paint a few ancient themes. Mr. Xu has always sharply criticized this kind of formalism and dogmatism education method that is irresponsible to youth and art with his own art, conscience, and enthusiasm for caring for youth. However, those who were criticized often could not recognize their mistakes. Therefore, Mr. Xu's propositions on art education did not achieve the due effect in the old society. This was not until after liberation that it was truly evaluated and deservedly promoted; and the formalist and dogmatic educational tendencies that Mr. Xu opposed were also powerfully criticized, so that they no longer have a place in the field of art education.

For thirty years as one day, Mr. Xu has been engaged in the education of cultivating young people with unparalleled enthusiasm. In recent years, he has been recuperating from high blood pressure, but he still never forgets to care about the teaching work of the Art Academy. He personally lectured students on art history and presided over the review of new students' examination results and students studying in the Soviet Union... Especially moving is that during the summer vacation this year, when the teachers of the academy organized professional advanced studies, he enthusiastically formulated advanced study plans, selected reference materials, and tirelessly went to the studio on time every day to guide, revise paintings, and explain to the advanced students. In the work of cultivating young people, Mr. Xu always selflessly imparted all his knowledge and skills to them, and he often enthusiastically discovered artistic talents with keen artistic vision. For people with artistic talents, whether inside or outside the school, he was willing to do his best to cultivate them so that their talents would not be buried. Many excellent artists have grown up through his discovery and cultivation. It can be said that Mr. Xu has truly reached the point of selflessness in the work of cultivating young people, showing his noble quality of being willing to be a "stepping stone" for the younger generation. This will always become a model for those engaged in art education. In the art world, there is still the abnormal phenomenon of underestimating the work of cultivating young people. It is of great significance to promote Mr. Xu's spirit of devoting himself to the cause of art education.

Mr. Xu attached importance to sketching exercises and advocated a realistic style, and opposed formalism and dogmatism in educational methods, which has a certain progressive significance in art education. But it cannot be denied that his past educational thought, limited by the times and the environment, did not break through the category of old realism, and therefore still has great weaknesses, that is, it has not combined the purpose of education with the needs of the people as the starting point of education. Pointing out this weakness in Mr. Xu's educational thought is not an attempt to reduce his contribution to education, but to more clearly explain that the old society restricted his development in educational thought. After liberation, because Mr. Xu was brave in pursuing progress and accepted Chairman Mao's literary and art thought of "serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers," his educational thought underwent significant changes, and he began to realize that the people's education cause must be combined with the needs of the people. Therefore, he encouraged students to go to factories and villages for internships and agreed with them to engage in popularization work. In order to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, he repeatedly tried to exchange art works with the Soviet Union as a reference for art learning. At the same time, during this period, Mr. Xu also had new developments in creation. Before falling ill in 1951, he created many works depicting new themes and new characters, such as "Hearing the News of Nanjing's Liberation at the World Peace Conference" (ink painting), "Chairman Mao Among the People" (oil painting), "Lu Xun and Qu Qiubai" (oil painting draft), a portrait of Chairman Mao (oil painting), and more than 20 sketches of labor models and combat heroes.

Mr. Xu's progress in artistic thought, just like his progress in politics, is not accidental. It is the inevitable result of an artist who has always been upright, full of a sense of justice, and loves truth. Unfortunately, Mr. Xu has left us forever! Otherwise, we believe that he would have made more and higher achievements in education and art creation. His death is indeed a major loss to the Chinese art world. (Attached picture)

    向卓越的美术教育家徐悲鸿先生学习
    江丰
    我们美术界敬爱的徐悲鸿先生，不仅是一个卓越的画家，同时也是一个卓越的美术教育家；他对中国的美术教育事业的成长和发展，贡献是很大的。徐先生对美术教育最重要的贡献，就是他在艺术教学上一贯主张和坚持严格的素描练习和忠实于对象的写实精神。从这要求出发，他在长期实践中，建立了比较科学的训练方法，从而培养出了不少具有实学的美术工作者，这给中国美术教育的发展，无论在师资方面或在训练方法上，都准备了良好的条件，打下了结实的基础。
    徐先生在教学上所以十分重视素描练习，强调素描练习为培养美术家的最重要的课题，其目的是为了使学习者通过素描的练习能够掌握正确的写实方法和熟练的写实技术。徐先生认为：只有这样，在创作上才有可能达到得心应手的程度。这一看法，从他自己的艺术实践更可以证明是正确的。以他的国画创作为例，他所以能够突破传统的格式、题材，摆脱一般国画家的墨守陈法和摹仿古人的习气，而从事于现实事物的忠实描写，创造了形象正确生动的、富于现实感的、具有独特风格的作品，这显然与他的高度的素描修养是分不开的。素描在美术教育上的地位，如同造房屋的打基础工作，基础打得不巩固，房屋是造不起或造不好的，徐先生所以重视素描练习，其理由就在这里。
    徐先生要求素描练习必须忠实于描写对象，这并不是在提倡“依样画葫芦”的手法，这种自然主义的手法，他向来是坚决反对的。忠实于描写对象这个概念，徐先生一直认为除了要求对象的比例、明暗、轮廓、解剖等精确之外，更重要的，是通过这些现象的描写，应该表现出对象所具有的特性。为了达到这个要求，他在指导学生作画过程中，主张观察对象要“尽精微”，表现对象要“致广大”。这意思就是要求作画者细致地观察对象，根据自己理解对象的程度，从对象的复杂现象中，加以取舍和概括，找出它的规律，掌握它的大体，从而使对象的特性凸出，以达到单纯而又丰富的效果。徐先生为了防止学生作画用眼不用脑的倾向，曾十分强调锻炼记忆的“默画”作业。由此可见，徐先生所说的忠实于描写对象的这个概念，是有着丰富内容的，它与现实主义的艺术方法的要求是一致的。
    熟练的写实技术的获得，徐先生曾根据自己的经验，认为除了勤学苦练，再没有其它捷径可走。因此他要求学生多画，严格规定了课内外作业数量，并在学习态度上要求“诚实”，反对取巧和空谈。为了勉励学生在艺术学习上养成勤劳的习惯，他经常向他们说：要做一个具有真实功夫的艺术家，必须要有“拳不离手、曲不离口”的恒心。
    我们回忆一下旧中国时期的一般美术教育的混乱情况，就更显得徐先生的教育主张和教学方法的优越。在旧时代，大多数的美术教育工作者，受了西欧形式主义艺术的影响，在教学上轻视严格的素描练习和写实作风，提倡所谓“个性自由”，而实际上是在放任学生任意涂抹画面，鼓励学生养成偷懒取巧的习惯，因而很多有才能的美术青年的前途被贻误了。当时国画教学的缺点也很明显，几乎是以那种依照稿本临摹的陈旧方法去训练学生，结果，把学生训练成为只知摹仿前人和只会画几种古巳有之的题材的“国画家”。这种对青年、对艺术不负责的形式主义和公式主义的教育方法，徐先生一直是凭着自己的艺术、良心和爱护青年的热情，经常尖锐地给予批评的。然而那些被批评者往往不能认识自己的错误，因此，徐先生在美术教育上的主张，在旧社会中并没有得到应有的效果，这直到解放后，才得到了真实的评价和应有的发扬；而徐先生所反对的那种形式主义和公式主义的教育倾向，也受到了有力的批判，从而在美术教育的领域中已不再有它们的地位了。
    三十年如一日地，徐先生一直是以无比的热情从事培养青年的教育工作，近年来因患高血压症在休养中，但还是念念不忘地关心美术学院的教学工作，他亲自给学生讲美术史，主持评审新生和赴苏学习学生的考试成绩……。尤其令人感动的，是今年暑期，学院的教员组织业务进修时，他非常热情地制订进修计划，选集参考资料，不知疲倦地每天按时到工作室指导，给进修者改画和讲解。徐先生在培养青年的工作中，总是无私地将自己所有的知识和技能传授给他们，并且他经常以敏锐的艺术眼光，热心地发掘着艺术的才能，对于具有艺术才能的人，不论是校内或校外的，他都愿尽心加以培植，使他们的才能不被湮没。有不少优秀的美术家，就是经过他的发现和培植而成长起来的。徐先生对培养青年的工作，可以说，真正达到了忘我的程度，表现了他甘愿做青年一代“垫脚石”的崇高品质。这将永远成为从事美术教育工作者的榜样。在美术界中，还存在着轻视培养青年工作的这种反常现象的今天，发扬徐先生以全身心付与美术教育事业的精神，是有重大的意义的。
    徐先生重视素描练习和主张写实作风，反对形式主义和公式主义的教育方法，这在美术教育上是具有一定的进步意义的。但也不能否认，他过去的教育思想，受了时代和环境的局限，并没有突破旧现实主义的范畴，因而还存在着很大的弱点，这就是还没有把教育的目的和人民的需要结合起来作为教育事业的出发点。指出徐先生的教育思想这一弱点，并不是企图降低他对教育事业的贡献，只是更明确地说明旧社会束缚了他在教育思想方面的发展。解放后，由于徐先生勇于追求进步，接受了毛主席所指示的“为工农兵服务”的文艺思想，于是他的教育思想起了显著的变化，开始认识了人民的教育事业必须与人民的需要相结合这一原则。因此，他鼓励学生下厂下乡实习，赞成他们从事普及工作，为了向苏联的先进经验学习，他曾屡次设法与苏联交换美术作品作为艺术学习上的借鉴。同时，在这个时期，徐先生在创作上也有了新的发展，在一九五一年卧病之前，创作了不少描写新主题和新人物的作品，如“在世界和平大会听到南京解放的消息”（水墨画）、“毛主席在人民中”（油画）、“鲁迅与瞿秋白”（油画稿）、毛主席像（油画），以及二十多幅劳动模范和战斗英雄的素描像。
    徐先生在艺术思想上的进步，正与他在政治上的进步一样，并不是偶然的，这是一个向来为人正直、富于正义感和热爱真理的艺术家的必然结果。不幸徐先生已永远离开我们了！否则，我们相信他在教育事业上和艺术创作上一定会有更多和更高的成就的；他的逝世，实在是中国美术界的一个重大损失。（附图片）
