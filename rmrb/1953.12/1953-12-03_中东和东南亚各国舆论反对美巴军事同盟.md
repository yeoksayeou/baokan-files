Xinhua News Agency, December 30th: Middle Eastern newspapers have commented on the proposed US-Pakistan military alliance, denouncing the US conspiracy to threaten the peace and security of Middle Eastern countries.

    The "Anis" newspaper in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, pointed out: The signing of the US-Pakistan military alliance will threaten the security of the Middle East. The newspaper said: We do not need cannons and rifles. We must develop our agriculture and industry and exploit our natural wealth. We need peace and security to achieve these goals.

    The "Al Khabar" newspaper in Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, commented: "The United States is taking advantage of Pakistan's needs." A few months ago, the United States promised to give Pakistan so-called wheat "aid," and "today the United States is exacting a heavy price in return for this aid."

    Baghdad's "Sawt al-Sha'ab" said on the 25th: Even if senior Pakistani authorities try to deny the US-Pakistan negotiations, "Middle Eastern countries still do not believe that a military alliance threatening their fundamental survival is not brewing."

    Southeast Asian public opinion also continues to oppose the US-Pakistan military alliance. The Tamil "Thinakaran" newspaper in Colombo, the capital of Ceylon, said on the 23rd: "Anyone who cares about the peaceful life and development of these three countries (India, Pakistan, and Ceylon) cannot but be troubled by the rumored US-Pakistan alliance."

Xinhua News Agency, December 2nd: Southeast Asian and Middle Eastern newspapers, commenting on the US-Pakistan military alliance negotiations, pointed out that this military alliance will undermine Pakistan's sovereignty and threaten the peace and security of Southeast Asia and the Middle East.

    Indian newspapers continue to oppose the US conspiracy. The Bombay "Blitz Weekly" published a dispatch from its London correspondent. The reporter said that in Britain, the US-Pakistan negotiations are considered "the biggest action since the establishment of Pakistan aimed at opposing India." The reporter pointed out that the proposed military alliance has far-reaching political goals: it is clear that arming Pakistan will inevitably drag India into an arms race and create a threat of "armed conflict" between the two countries. The reporter said that the arms race would seriously damage India's economy and prestige and undermine India's independence. The reporter emphasized that Eisenhower and Dulles' policy of "using Asians to fight Asians" has never been as threatening as it is today.

    Jakarta's "Pedoman" in Indonesia published an editorial on November 27, calling on Pakistan not to sign a military alliance with the United States. The newspaper wrote: The United States wants to conclude a military alliance with Pakistan in an attempt to drag Asian countries into the US-organized aggressive bloc, and to split the unity of Asian and African countries, thereby weakening Asian countries. The newspaper then said: "For these reasons, Arab countries refuse to participate in the Western defense system. Therefore, Pakistan should not form a military alliance with the United States either. The Pakistani government should seriously consider that such a practice would harm Pakistan's friendly relations with its Asian neighbors. Because if Pakistan concludes a military treaty with the United States, this friendly relationship will definitely be lost. We advise Pakistan to consider the consequences of this step, which has caused a wave of unease on the Asian continent."

    In the Middle East, the "Anis" newspaper in Kabul, Afghanistan, published an editorial entitled "The United States Arming Pakistan Threatens the Security of the Middle East," saying: We strongly oppose arming Pakistan because we believe this measure runs counter to the cause of maintaining peace in Asia. The editorial also pointed out that US military aid to Pakistan has aroused the distrust of the people of Middle Eastern countries in "US policy."

    In another article, the newspaper pointed out that the conclusion of the US-Pakistan military alliance and the provision of military aid to Pakistan will make the contradictions in the Middle East region even more acute. The United States should bear direct responsibility for this situation.

### 中东和东南亚各国舆论反对美巴军事同盟

    中东和东南亚各国舆论反对美巴军事同盟
    【新华社三十日讯】中东国家的报纸对拟订中的美国和巴基斯坦的军事同盟发表评论，斥责美国威胁中东各国和平与安全的阴谋。
    阿富汗首都喀布尔“友谊报”指出：美巴军事同盟的签订，将威胁中东的安全。该报说：我们不需要大炮和来福枪。我们必须发展我们的农业和工业，开发我们的天然财富。我们需要和平与安全以达到这些目的。
    伊拉克首都巴格达“消息报”评论说：“美国正在利用巴基斯坦的需要。”几个月前，美国答应了给予巴基斯坦以所谓小麦“援助”，“今天美国索取重大代价以偿付这次援助。”
    巴格达的“人民之声报”在二十五日说：纵然巴基斯坦的高级当局试图否认巴美谈判，但是“中东各国还是不相信威胁着它们的根本生存的军事联盟并不在酝酿。”
    东南亚的舆论也继续反对美巴军事同盟。锡兰首都科伦坡的泰米尔文“丁纳卡兰报”在二十三日说：“只要是关心这三国（印度、巴基斯坦和锡兰）的和平生活与发展的人，没有不因传闻中的美巴联盟而感到烦恼的。”
    【新华社二日讯】东南亚和中东国家报纸在评论美巴军事同盟谈判时指出：这一军事同盟将破坏巴基斯坦的主权，并威胁东南亚和中东的和平与安全。
    印度报纸继续反对美国的阴谋。孟买“闪电周报”刊载了该报驻伦敦记者的一篇通讯。记者说，在英国，美巴谈判被认为是“自巴基斯坦成立以后的旨在反对印度的最大的一次行动”。记者指出，拟议中的军事同盟有其深远的政治目的：很明显，武装巴基斯坦的行动将不可避免地把印度卷入军备竞赛，并将造成两国之间“武装冲突”的威胁。记者说，军备竞赛将给印度经济和威望以严重打击，并将损害印度的独立。记者着重指出，艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯的“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的政策，从来没有像今天这样带有威胁性。
    印尼雅加达的“观察报”在十一月二十七日发表社论，要求巴基斯坦不要和美国签订军事同盟。该报写道：美国想和巴基斯坦订立军事同盟，是企图把亚洲国家拉进美国筹组的侵略集团，并分裂亚洲和非洲国家的团结，从而削弱亚洲各国。该报接着说：“由于这些原因，阿拉伯国家拒绝参加西方国家的防御体系。因此巴基斯坦也不应当和美国结成军事同盟。巴基斯坦政府应当认真考虑到这样一种做法会损害巴基斯坦和它的亚洲邻国的友好关系。因为如果巴基斯坦和美国缔结军事条约，这种友好关系就一定会丧失。我们建议巴基斯坦考虑一下这一在亚洲大陆引起了不安的浪潮的步骤的后果。”
    在中东，阿富汗喀布尔的“友谊报”发表题为
  “美国武装巴基斯坦威胁了中东的安全”的社论说：我们竭力反对武装巴基斯坦，因为我们认为这种措施是与维护亚洲和平的事业背道而驰的。社论并指出，美国对巴基斯坦的军事援助引起了中东各国人民对“美国政策的不信任”。
    该报在另一篇文章中指出，美巴军事同盟的缔结和给予巴基斯坦以军事援助，将使中东这个地区的矛盾更加尖锐。美国对这种情况应负直接责任。
