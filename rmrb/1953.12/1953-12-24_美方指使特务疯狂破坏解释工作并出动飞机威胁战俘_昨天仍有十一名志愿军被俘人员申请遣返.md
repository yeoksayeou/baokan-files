Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 23rd: Today, American "psychological warfare" experts specially selected a group of Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war whom they believed would not apply for repatriation to come to the explanation camp in Dongchang-ri. They also changed their strategy from the previous two days and directed their special agent pawns to turn the explanation tent into a noisy madhouse, attempting to prevent the repatriation of prisoners of war and cover up their failures of the previous two days. At 2:09 PM, four American jet fighters flew over the explanation site, and the piercing screech caused great psychological threat to the prisoners of war. However, despite this, of the approximately 250 prisoners of war who came to listen to the explanations from Camp No. 4, eleven prisoners of war applied for repatriation on the spot. Among these prisoners of war, who were falsely claimed by the U.S. side as "preferring death to repatriation," some openly accused the U.S. side of forcibly detaining prisoners of war in the explanation tents to the neutral nations personnel, once again making the American "representatives" present feel extremely ashamed.

Almost all the prisoners of war who listened to the explanation fearfully sized up the American "representatives" present after entering the tent, and dared not sit down to listen to the explanation. Many people made the same movement – covering their ears with their hands or turning their backs to the explanation representative. They said the same thing in unison:
  "Don't talk, I've already made up my mind!" This was obviously the result of prior coercion by Chiang Kai-shek's special agents.

Today, neutral nations personnel witnessed an event that fully illustrates how the U.S. side coerced prisoners of war into not demanding repatriation. In Tent No. 10, a prisoner of war stole glances nervously at the American "representatives," muttering: "Counterattack the mainland, counterattack the mainland." But after listening to the explanation representative's explanation, he mustered his courage and shouted: "Return home! Return home!" He tore off his reactionary armband with trembling fingers. Just as he stepped out of the tent after applying for repatriation, he suddenly saw two American military personnel pacing outside the tent. The prisoner of war immediately turned pale and ran back to the tent, trembling, asking the explanation representative to accompany him out. Under the accompaniment of the explanation representative, he cautiously walked to the tent waiting for repatriation. Our explanation representative immediately asked the Indian chairman to stop the U.S. personnel from threatening the prisoners of war and to prevent them from deliberately wandering outside the door of the repatriation application tent.

In Tent No. 28, a prisoner of war also said fearfully upon entering, "Don't talk, I've already made up my mind!" The explanation representative explained to him kindly for twenty minutes, and the prisoner of war finally said what he had been afraid to say: "I want to return home!"

In Tent No. 18, a young prisoner of war just shed tears and didn't speak. The explanation representative asked him, "Why don't you come back?" He said, "They (referring to special agents) all say they will kill me." The prisoner of war stayed in the tent and dared not come out until the explanation representative explained the situation clearly and guaranteed that he would not encounter special agent assassinations on the way back. Only then did he walk out of the repatriation application door.

In Tent No. 20, a prisoner of war had a terrified look on his face and kept his head down in silence after entering the tent. After listening to the explanation, he raised his head, his eyes already red. He said excitedly: "How many of our people have the Americans killed! They didn't give us treatment when we were sick, letting people die of illness. Some patients even became experimental subjects for American doctors and were cut open and killed by them. In Jeju Island, the Americans once asked me to bury corpses, and I saw with my own eyes that some had their hearts dug out, their tongues cut off, and some even had their brains dug out. The lucky ones who survived were drawn blood several times a year, but they ate only a small bowl of moldy rice every day, and they only received a set of clothes every two years! In this way, the special agents threatened me, saying that I had tattoos on my body and would definitely be killed if I returned home. Anyway, I want to return home, I can't die in the hands of the Americans!..." The prisoner of war's tragic accusation made the American "representative" sitting aside extremely embarrassed, and the Swedish member of the subsidiary agency also felt uneasy, and said to the Indian chairman: "This prisoner of war has decided to be repatriated and should be rushed out." The Indian chairman told him: "No, this prisoner of war has suffered for more than two years in the prisoner of war camp, it is right to speak out."

Today, the American personnel still disregarded the Indian chairman's repeated warnings, trying every means to threaten the prisoners of war, making them afraid to apply for repatriation. The American "translator" in Tent No. 1 stood up fiercely twice to threaten the prisoners of war. Once, when a prisoner of war calmed down and was thinking, the "translator" actually stood up and said, "Don't be afraid of threats!" Yesterday, this "translator" also deliberately translated our explanation representative as "explanation staff," and was warned by the Indian chairman. Our representative pointed out to the subsidiary agency that this "translator" repeatedly threatened the prisoners of war deliberately, and demanded that he be driven away. When our representative made this request, the American "observer representative" whispered triumphantly to his partner, the "detaining party representative": "Look, they are opposed to the Indian chairman, which is exactly what I want." At this moment, the Indian chairman ordered the "translator" to leave the explanation tent. In Tent No. 4, a Kuomintang special agent acting as the "detaining party representative" shouted loudly at a prisoner of war who was walking towards the repatriation application door: "You're going the wrong way!" Frightened, the prisoner of war hurried back. After our explanation representative protested, the chairman of the subsidiary agency asked the Kuomintang special agent to leave the tent and said, "You are not allowed to come here this afternoon!"

    美方指使特务疯狂破坏解释工作并出动飞机威胁战俘
    昨天仍有十一名志愿军被俘人员申请遣返
    【新华社开城二十三日电】今天美国“心理战”专家们特地挑选了一批他们认为不会申请遣返的中国人民志愿军被俘人员来到东场里解释营场，并且改变了前两天的策略，又指使他们的特务爪牙把解释帐篷弄成像喧嚷的疯人院，企图阻止战俘遣返和遮掩他们在前两天所遭受的失败。到下午两点零九分，竟有四架美军喷气式飞机从解释场所上空飞过，刺耳的啸声使战俘们在心理上受到极大威胁。但是尽管如此，从第四号营场出来的约二百五十名听解释的战俘中，仍有十一名战俘当场申请遣返。这些被美方谎称为“宁死也不愿遣返”的战俘中，有些人在解释帐篷中当场向中立国人员控诉了美方强迫扣留战俘的罪行，又一次使得在场的美国“代表”们无地自容。
    几乎所有听解释的战俘在进入帐篷后就恐惧地打量着在场的美国“代表”，都不敢坐下来听解释。很多人做着一样的动作——用手堵着耳朵或者背对着解释代表。他们不约而同地说着同样的话：
  “你不要讲了，我早决定好了！”这显然都是蒋匪特务在事先胁迫他们这样做的。
    今天中立国人员目睹了一件足以充分说明美方如何胁迫战俘不得要求遣返的事情。在第十号帐篷中，有一个战俘局促不安地偷看美方“代表”的眼色，口中念念有词地喊着：“反攻大陆，反攻大陆。”但他听了解释代表的解释后，就壮着胆量喊：“回国！回国！”他用激动得发抖的手指撕掉反动臂章。在他申请遣返后刚刚跨出帐篷时，他蓦然看见了两个在帐篷外面踱步的美军人员，这个战俘立刻面色如土，颤抖着跑回帐篷，要求解释代表陪同他一块出去。在解释代表的陪伴下，他才战战兢兢地走向等待遣返的帐篷。我方解释代表当即要求印度主席制止美方人员这种威胁战俘的行动，不许他们再故意在申请遣返的门外徘徊。
    在第二十八号帐篷，一个战俘进来后也同样恐惧地连声说：“你不要讲了，我早决定好了！”解释代表亲切地向他解释了二十分钟，这个战俘终于说出了他所一直不敢说出的话：“我要回国！”
    在第十八号帐篷，一个年青的战俘光流眼泪不说话，解释代表问他：“你为什么不回来？”他才说：“他们（指特务）都说要杀我。”这个战俘呆在帐篷里不敢出来，一直到解释代表把情况讲清楚，保证他在遣返回来的路上再不会遇到特务暗害，他才从申请遣返的门走了出来。
    在第二十号帐篷，一个战俘在进入帐篷后一直面带恐怖的神色，低头不语。听过解释后，他抬起头来，两眼已经发红了，他激动地说：“美国人杀死了多少我们的人啊！我们生病，他们不给治疗，让人活活病死。有些病人还成为美国医生的试验品，被他们开刀开死。在济州岛，美国人有一次叫我去埋尸体，我亲眼看见有的被挖了心、割了舌头，有的甚至连脑子也挖出来了。侥幸活着的人，一年要被抽好几次血，每天所吃到的却是一小碗发霉的饭，两年才能领一套衣服！这样，特务们还威胁我说，我身上刺了字，回国一定被杀死。不管怎样，我也要回国，反正不能死在美国人手里！……”这个战俘悲愤的控诉使得坐在一边的美国“代表”异常狼狈，附属机构的瑞典委员也感觉不安，竟向印度主席说：“这个战俘已经决定遣返，应该赶快出去。”印度主席告诉他：“不，这个战俘在战俘营里受了两年多的苦，讲一讲是应该的。”
    今天美方人员仍然不顾印度主席的多次警告，千方百计地威胁战俘，使战俘不敢申请遣返。第一号帐篷的美方“翻译”曾两次凶恶地站起来威胁战俘。有一次当一个战俘冷静下来沉思的时候，这个
  “翻译”竟迳自站起来说：“不要怕威胁！”在昨天，这个“翻译”也故意把我方解释代表译成“解释员”，受到印度主席的警告。我方代表向附属机构指出这个“翻译”一犯再犯，故意威胁战俘，要求把他赶走。当我方代表提出这一要求时，美方的
  “观察代表”竟得意地低声对他的搭挡“拘留一方代表”说：“你看，他们和印度主席对立起来了，这正是我所乐意的。”就在这时候，印度主席命令这个“翻译”离开解释帐篷。在第四号帐篷，一个充作“拘留一方代表”的国民党特务竟对一个走向申请遣返的门的战俘大声说：“你走错了！”吓得那个战俘慌忙走回来。我方解释代表提出抗议后，附属机构主席就要这个国民党特务离开帐篷，并且说：“下午不许你到这里来！”
