    Shandong Province actively seeks effective ways to solve the problem of the future of primary school graduates.
    In the past four years, Shandong Province's secondary education has greatly developed. The number of middle schools has increased from 77 before liberation to 192; the number of middle school students has also increased from more than 28,000 to more than 142,000. However, due to objective limitations, it is still impossible to enroll a large number of applicants. This summer, only 29,218 students were admitted, accounting for slightly more than 9.7% of the total number of applicants. This situation has caused some ideological fluctuations among some students and parents.
    After learning about this situation, the Party committees and people's governments at all levels in Shandong Province, after the summer enrollment this year, held various meetings through Party and administrative leaders or through the Communist Youth League and cultural and educational institutions, such as meetings of unsuccessful students, meetings of parents of students, neighborhood group meetings, and mass rallies, to explain the truth to everyone and explain that participating in agricultural labor after graduating from elementary school also has a promising future.
    This summer, the cultural and educational leading organs in various cities in Shandong fully utilized and leveraged the potential of existing middle school teachers and school buildings to increase the number of classes and expand enrollment. For example, in Jinan, Qingdao, and the locations of various special districts, middle schools with better conditions have implemented a two-shift system. According to statistics, Jinan and Qingdao have added a total of 80 classes, enrolling 4,000 new students. Qingdao has established five cultural tutoring schools, and attached tutoring classes or night schools to junior and senior middle schools with available facilities, solving the enrollment problems of some students. This year, Qingdao had more than 9,000 primary school graduates, and only more than 2,000 new junior high school students were enrolled in the summer. After taking various measures, the study problems of 6,000 people were solved. Currently, the study problems of the remaining 1,000 primary school graduates are still being resolved.
    In the rural areas of Shandong, they are starting to pilot spare-time tutoring schools for rural primary school graduates, vigorously helping them organize spare-time self-study groups to study, or absorbing them into night schools and advanced literacy schools. In addition, they are absorbed into mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives to serve as bookkeepers; they are absorbed into production technology dissemination conferences to teach and publicize agricultural technical knowledge to farmers through them, and to read newspapers to farmers, which is of great help to rural work. The head of Haiya Township, District 1, Rongcheng County, said: "These students are very active in their work and have completed many tasks with their help." Primary school graduates have experienced the loveliness and glory of labor from the process of participating in labor, changed their views of despising labor, and improved their ideological awareness. One young student said: "Now, I can produce grain myself, and what I eat and wear depends on myself; the grain I produce can also supply the needs of the city, which is truly glorious!" Some said: "If someone asks me: What did you do in the country's first five-year plan? I will tell him: We are soldiers on the agricultural production front, supplying the workers with food." Some primary school students said: "We must actively learn agricultural technology and settle down to production; we must respond to the call of the motherland at any time, and we will happily do whatever the motherland wants us to do." These examples fully illustrate that primary school graduates can not only become a vital force on the agricultural production front, but also can become disseminators of agricultural technical knowledge.
    Based on the handling of primary school graduates this year, Shandong is preparing to explain to primary school teachers in the general line propaganda: national education must be subordinate to national industrial construction. Only when industrial production has greatly developed can agriculture, transportation, commerce, and cultural and educational undertakings develop accordingly. After receiving basic education, primary school graduates, according to the needs of national construction, will, in addition to a portion going to middle school to do other work, mostly serve agricultural production. And through teachers, conduct political education of loving labor and loving the motherland to students, so that they establish the idea of serving the people. At the same time, actively pilot spare-time tutoring schools for rural primary school graduates, so that primary school graduates can have the opportunity to continue learning, so that they can engage in labor production and study at the same time. For those primary school graduates who only engage in labor production but do not study, help them overcome difficulties and continuously improve and progress politically and ideologically, so as to give play to their greater role.

    山东积极设法解决小学毕业生出路问题
    山东省各级人民政府，采取各种有效办法，解决小学毕业生的出路问题。
    四年来山东省的中等教育事业有大的发展，中学校已由解放前的七十七所发展到一百九十二所；中学生也由二万八千多人增加到十四万二千余。但由于客观条件的限制，仍不能大量地录取投考的学生。今年暑期仅录取了二万九千二百一十八人，占投考生总数的百分之九点七强。这种情况曾在部分学生和家长中引起了某些思想波动。
    山东省各级党委、各级人民政府了解到这种情况后，在今年暑假招生后，曾由各地党、行政负责人或通过青年团、文教机关召开了各种会议，如落考学生会议、学生家长会议、居民小组会和群众大会，向大家讲清道理，说明小学毕业生参加农业劳动同样是有前途的。
    今年夏季，山东各城市文教领导机关，充分运用和发挥了现有中学教师和校舍设备的潜力，增加班次，扩大招生名额。如济南、青岛两市及各个专署驻地，条件较好的中学都实行了二部制。据统计，济南、青岛两市共增设了八十个班，增收新生四千人。青岛市设立了五处文化补习学校，并在有条件的初级中学、高级中学校中附设补习班或夜校，解决了一部分同学的入学问题。青岛市今年共有高小毕业生九千多人，暑期招收的初中新生只有两千多人，采取各种办法后，解决了六千人的学习问题。目前，其余一千多名小学毕业生的学习问题也正在继续进行解决中。
    山东各地农村中，正开始试办农村小学毕业生业余补习学校，大力帮助他们组织业余自修小组进行学习，或吸收他们到夜校、高级民校学习。此外，吸收他们参加互助组、农业生产合作社，担任记账员；吸收他们参加生产技术传授会，通过他们向农民传授，宣传农业技术知识，给农民读报，这对农村工作帮助很大。荣成县一区海崖乡乡长说：“这批学生工作积极，在他们的帮助下，完成了许多的任务。”小学毕业生从参加劳动的过程中，体验到劳动的可爱和光荣，转变了轻视劳动的观点，提高了思想觉悟。有一个青年同学说：“现在，自己能生产粮食了，吃的穿的都靠自己；我生产的粮食还能供给城市的需要，这才是真光荣啊！”有的说：
  “如果有人问我：你在国家第一个五年计划中干了什么？我就会告诉他：我们是农业生产战线上的战士，供应了工人们的粮食。”有的小学生说：“我们要积极学习农业技术，安心生产；随时响应祖国的召唤，祖国要我们干什么，我们就愉快地去干什么。”这些例子充分地说明，小学毕业生不仅可以成为农业生产战线上的生力军，而且可以成为农业技术知识的传播者。
    根据今年小学毕业生的处理情况，山东各地准备在总路线宣传中向小学教师说明：国民教育必须服从国家工业建设，只有工业生产有了大的发展，农业、交通运输业、商业以及文化教育事业，才有可能得到相应的发展。高小毕业生，在受过基础教育后，根据国家建设的需要，除一部分升入中学将作其他工作外，绝大部分将为农业生产服务。并通过教师，向学生进行爱劳动、爱祖国的政治教育，使他们树立为人民服务的思想。同时，积极试办农村小学毕业生业余补习学校，使小学毕业生能够得到继续学习的机会，使他们一面劳动生产，一面进行学习。对那些只从事劳动生产，而不进行学习的小学毕业生，帮助他们克服困难，使之在政治上、思想上不断提高和进步，以便发挥其更大的作用。
