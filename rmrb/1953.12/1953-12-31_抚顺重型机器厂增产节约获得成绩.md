Respectable Chairman Mao:
    Under the wise leadership of the Party and you, in the first year of the nation's First Five-Year Plan, we responded to the Party's call and launched a campaign to increase production and practice economy. On the basis of strengthening planned management, we solved key production problems by promoting advanced experiences. We completed the state plan for total production value, total commodity value, cost reduction, and profit delivery thirty-eight days ahead of schedule. By the end of October, cost reduction had reached 226.9% of the annual plan. By the end of November, profit delivery had reached 103.4% of the annual production increase plan. By December 19th, total production value had reached 100.11% of the production increase plan, and total commodity value had reached 100.04% of the production increase plan. However, we will never be complacent. Under the illumination of the Party's general line for the transition period, we will further strengthen planned management, strive to overcome shortcomings in our work, and prepare for next year's production to accelerate the socialist industrialization of our motherland.
                  All staff and workers of Fushun Heavy Machinery Plant

    抚顺重型机器厂增产节约获得成绩敬爱的毛主席：
    在党和您的英明领导下，在祖国第一个五年建设计划的第一年，我们响应了党的号召，开展了增产节约竞赛，并在加强计划管理的基础上，以推广先进经验的方法解决了生产的关键问题，全年提前三十八天完成了国家计划的生产总值、商品总值、降低成本和上缴利润的任务。到十月底，降低成本已完成全年计划百分之二二六点九。到十一月底，上缴利润已完成全年增产计划百分之一○三点四。到十二月十九日，生产总值已完成增产计划百分之一○○点一一，商品总值已完成增产计划百分之一○○点○四。但是，我们决不自满。在党的过渡时期的总路线照耀下，我们要进一步加强计划管理，努力克服工作中的缺点，做好明年生产准备工作，为加速祖国社会主义工业化而奋斗。
                  抚顺重型机器厂全体职工
