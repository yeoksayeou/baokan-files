	Professional Talents Must Be Rationally Allocated to Maximize Their Work Efficiency

	Editor's Note: Rationally allocating and utilizing specialized talents to ensure the unity of learning and application is essential for maximizing work efficiency. This is a principle that personnel departments of all agencies must adhere to when assigning cadres. However, there are still some units where irrational phenomena exist in personnel allocation and utilization. The following letters are published in the hope that relevant departments will pay attention to investigating and addressing them.

	It is Inappropriate to Have Automotive Engineering Students Doing Sewer and Water Works
	Readers Wu Cheng and Wang Hancheng write: We are graduates of the Automotive Manufacturing program at Shanghai Jiaotong University this summer. Under the cultivation of the Party and the government, we have overcome various difficulties in our studies, developed a deep love for our chosen field, and are prepared to participate in the construction of our nation's automotive industry with great enthusiasm. However, after arriving at the First Design Bureau of the First Ministry of Machinery Industry in late August, we were assigned to the sanitation engineering section to design water supply, sewerage, heating, and ventilation systems. Of course, this is an indispensable part of the country's basic construction; however, it is too far removed from our area of expertise. As a result, we have to start learning even the basic courses from scratch. We have discussed this with our superiors repeatedly, but the leaders always emphasize that the unit lacks personnel and insist that we do this work. In reality, we have been here for more than a month and still cannot participate in any work, so we can only study Russian first. The construction project of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant is currently accelerating, but those of us who studied automotive manufacturing are idle here, and we feel very sad. We hope that the higher-level leading organs can carefully consider our work issues and allow us to go where the country needs us.

	Why Not Let Surveying Talents Do Surveying Work?
	Yu Lenan, Qian Yongning, Lu Kangsheng, and Zhu Deyi of Nanjing Geological School write: We are this year's graduates of the Surveying Department of Shanghai Tongji University. Sixteen of our classmates were assigned to the Central Geological Department by the Central Personnel Department, and eight of them were sent to Nanjing Geological School. But when they arrived in Nanjing, the Nanjing Geological School said that there were too many people and transferred four classmates back to the Central Geological Department. The four classmates who remained at the Nanjing Geological School were assigned to teach mathematics and physics, and the comrades felt that there was a "mismatch between learning and application." The two comrades assigned to Xi'an Geological School were idle for more than twenty days. Initially, the school asked them to teach mathematics, but after a few days, the number of mathematics teachers increased, and the principal asked them to take a year off. Only after repeated requests were they assigned other work. The two comrades assigned to Xuanhua Geological School were transferred to the North China Geological Bureau because the school was abolished. After being idle for more than twenty days, they were returned to the Central Geological Department. Currently, many work units are using one surveying person as three or four, so why aren't the personnel departments of these agencies letting surveying people do surveying work?

	Wasted Enterprise Financial Talents
	Zhu Furong of the Xikang Provincial People's Government writes: I am a graduate of the Enterprise Financial Management Department of Jiangsu Provincial Cadre School.

	In the past, the school leaders repeatedly said: The Southwest lacks cadres, and being assigned to the Southwest will surely ensure "unity of learning and application." After we graduated, the Southwest Financial Administration assigned us to Xikang. As a result, several of our classmates who studied industrial enterprise cost accounting did not find suitable work. For example, Comrade Jin Zhimei was assigned to Ya'an County, but the Ya'an County Personnel Section said: "We don't need people here." She could only do accounting work in the office. Jin Zhimei only processes three or four accounts each day and has nothing else to do. The other two classmates are the same.

	Currently, the country is engaged in planned economic construction, and there are many places that need industrial enterprise financial accounting personnel. Why did the Xikang Provincial Department of Finance assign people who studied enterprise financial management to counties that have no industrial enterprises?

### 必须合理分配专业人才  发挥他们的工作效能

专栏：读者来信摘要

    必须合理分配专业人才
    发挥他们的工作效能
    编者按：合理地分配和使用专门人才，使学用一致，才能更好地发挥工作效能。这是各机关人事部门在分配干部时必须遵行的原则。但现仍有某些单位在人事分配和使用上存在着不合理的现象。下面刊登的几件来信，希有关部门注意调查处理。
   不该让汽车专业的学生做上下水道的工作
    读者吴成、王汉城来信：我们是今年暑期上海交通大学汽车制造专业的毕业生。在党和政府的培养下，我们克服了学习中的种种困难，树立起对自己所学专业的高度热爱，抱着极大的热忱准备参加祖国汽车工业的建设工作。但八月底我们到第一机械工业部第一设计分局后，被分配的工作却是卫生工程科上下水道与暖气通风设计。当然，这在国家基本建设中是一项不可缺少的工作；但和我们所学的专业距离得太远了。因此，我们甚至连基本课程都必须从头学起。我们和领导同志再三商量，领导同志总是强调本单位缺人，硬要我们做这方面的工作；实际上我们来了一个多月，还是不能参加任何工作，只好先学习俄文。第一汽车制造厂的建设工程目前正在加速进行，我们这些学汽车制造专业的人却在此无所事事，我们感到非常难过。希望上级领导机关能慎重考虑我们的工作问题，让我们能够到国家需要我们的地方去。
    为什么不让测量人才做测量工作
    南京地质学校虞乐南、钱永宁、陆康生、朱德彧来信：我们是上海同济大学测量系本届毕业生。我们有十六个同学经中央人事部分配到中央地质部，其中有八个同志被派到南京地质学校。但他们到了南京，南京地质学校说人多了，就调出四个同学回中央地质部。我们留在南京地质学校工作的四个同学分任教数学物理课程，同志们都感到“学用不一致”。被分配到西安地质学校去的二位同志闲了二十多天没有事干。开始校方让他们教数学，隔了几天，数学教员增多了，校长就要他们休息一年再说。经过一再请求，才给他们另派工作。派到宣化地质学校的二位同志，因为学校撤消了，又被调到华北地质局，闲了二十多天，又被退到中央地质部。现在许多工作单位把一个测量人员当三、四人用，为什么这些机关的人事部门不让测量的人做测量工作？
    被浪费着的企业财务人才
    西康省人民政府朱福荣来信：我是江苏省干部学校企业财务管理系的毕业生。
    过去学校领导方面都一再说：西南缺少干部，派到西南去一定能“学用一致”。我们毕业后，西南财政管理局分配我们到西康，结果我们学工业企业成本会计的几个同学都没有得到适当的工作。如金至美同志分配到雅安县，雅安县人事科说：“我们这里不需要人。”只好做机关中的会计工作。金至美每天只过三、四笔帐，没有什么事可做。另外两个同学也是如此。
    目前国家正在有计划经济建设，需要工业企业财务核算人员的地方很多，为什么西康省财政厅要把学企业财务管理的人员分配到没有工业企业的县里去？
