    Xinhua News Agency, December 20th dispatch from Paris: During the "Week of Struggle for Peace in Vietnam," Parisian workers held a mass meeting at the Salle de la Mutualité on the 18th.

    Speaking at the meeting was Alain Le Léap, Secretary-General of the French General Confederation of Labor (CGT). In his speech, he pointed out the achievements of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in raising the material and cultural living standards of the people and explained why the French working people opposed this colonial war, which went against the national interests of France. Le Léap said: "It is only because some people want to continue this senseless war that our country and army have been brought to disgrace. We are convinced that our demand to end this war is equivalent to defending the interests of the working class and the entire country, and equivalent to contributing to the restoration of France's prestige."

    Also speaking at the meeting were Henri Martin and Prisot, secretary of the French Single Socialist Party, among others.

    The participants in the meeting passed a resolution stating that they would ensure the mobilization of "parliamentarians to demand that the National Assembly and the Senate of the Republic consider Ho Chi Minh's statement and advise the government to begin negotiations."

    Xinhua News Agency, December 20th dispatch from Tokyo: On the "International Day of Active Support for the Vietnamese People and the Day of Struggle for Stopping the Colonial War in Vietnam," many representatives of Japanese progressive trade unions, political groups, and other people's organizations (including Jiichiro Matsumoto, etc.) held a meeting in Tokyo, warmly supporting President Ho Chi Minh of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam’s talk on the peaceful settlement of the Vietnam issue.

    The meeting passed a telegram of respect, expressing respect to the heroic Vietnamese people who have resisted for seven years. The resolution made at the meeting called on the Japanese people to fully support President Ho Chi Minh's statement of November 26th to the Swedish "Expressen" regarding the peaceful settlement of the Vietnam War, to support the World Federation of Trade Unions' proposal to strive for the cessation of the colonial war in Vietnam, and to oppose the French and American governments' obstruction of the realization of peace in Vietnam.

    日本社会领袖拥护胡志明关于和平解决越南问题的谈话
     【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社巴黎讯：在“争取越南和平斗争周”，巴黎工人十八日在团结厅举行了大会。
    在会上发言的有法国总工会总书记阿兰·勒里普。他在发言中指出了越南民主共和国在提高人民物质和文化水平方面的成就，并说明了法国劳动人民为什么要反对这场违背法国民族利益的殖民战争。勒里普说：“只是由于一些人要继续这场毫无意义的战争，我们的国家和军队才弄到名誉扫地。我们确信，我们要求结束这场战争，就等于保卫工人阶级和整个国家的利益，就等于为恢复法国的威信作出贡献。”
    在会上发言的还有亨利·马丁和法国单一社会党书记普里索伊尔等人。
    参加大会的人们通过了一项决议，决议中提到保证动员“议员要求国民议会和共和国参议院考虑胡志明的声明并建议政府开始谈判”。

    会议通过了致敬电，对英勇抗战七年的越南人民表示敬意。会议作出的决议号召日本人民充分支持胡志明主席十一月二十六日对瑞典“快报”发表的关于和平解决越南战争的谈话，支持世界工会联合会关于争取停止越南殖民战争的主张，反对法国和美国政府阻挠越南和平的实现。
