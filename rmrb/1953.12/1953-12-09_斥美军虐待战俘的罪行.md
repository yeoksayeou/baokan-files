Denouncing the US Military's Crimes of Abusing Prisoners of War
Professor of Internal Medicine Liu Shih-hao

The exposure of the US military's crimes of abusing our captured personnel once again reveals the hideous face of US imperialism. Since the Korean armistice, some Chinese People's Volunteer Army prisoners of war have returned home. The atrocities they suffered in US military prisoner-of-war camps, and the serious consequences caused by the US military's irresponsibility in medical care and incorrect treatment, have reached an appalling degree. In order to solve the medical problems of the returning sick and wounded prisoners of war, the Chinese Red Cross Society hired domestic experts in various disciplines to conduct examinations. In the physical examinations of 1,609 returned sick and wounded personnel, it was found that the US military treated our captured personnel inhumanely, violating the provisions of the Geneva Convention regarding the treatment of prisoners of war. This was mainly manifested in the prisoners of war's nutritional deficiencies, the US military's irresponsibility in medical care, and various atrocities against the prisoners of war.

Experts from various disciplines also examined the returned non-sick and wounded prisoners of war. This group of 1,045 non-sick and wounded personnel were generally thin, pale, and malnourished, with a universal decrease in weight. More than 80% of the personnel showed a significant increase in weight after more than 20 days of returning home due to improved nutrition. The remainder who did not gain weight were because they originally suffered from severe nutritional edema. Although their nutrition improved after returning home and the edema disappeared, their weight still did not increase. Anemia was also extremely common, with an average hemoglobin of 10.3 grams. More than 80% were below 12 grams, more than 60% were below 11 grams, and more than 40% were below 10 grams. These non-sick and wounded personnel also universally exhibited vitamin deficiency, especially vitamin A and riboflavin deficiency. Vitamin A deficiency reached nearly 90%, of which 52.2% had night blindness, 63.1% had follicular hyperkeratosis of the skin, and 49.9% had xerophthalmia or Bitot's spots. Riboflavin deficiency affected 79.7% of the non-sick and wounded personnel, manifested as angular cheilitis, stomatitis, glossitis, and scrotal dermatitis. In short, nutritional deficiencies were extremely serious and widespread. According to the statements of returning personnel who served as cooks in the prisoner-of-war camps, the food supplied by the US military to the prisoners of war was not only insufficient in quality but also in quantity. Protein and fat were far below the minimum nutritional requirements, and various vitamins were very lacking, especially vitamin A and riboflavin, which were only one-tenth of the normal requirement. This fact can fully explain the extremely serious and widespread nutritional deficiencies we have witnessed. Non-sick and wounded personnel ate such food, and sick and wounded personnel also ate the same food, further hindering the recovery of illnesses and injuries. Article 26 of the Geneva Convention of August 12, 1949, stipulates: "The basic daily food rations shall be sufficient in quantity, quality, and variety to keep prisoners of war in good health and to prevent loss of weight or nutritional deficiencies." The US military violated the Geneva Convention in food supply, causing widespread and serious nutritional deficiencies among prisoners of war, for which they should bear full responsibility.

In the medical treatment of prisoners of war, the crimes committed by the US military were even more serious. Among the sick and wounded, there were 1,172 surgical cases and 567 internal medicine cases. Among the surgical cases, 637 were bone and joint injuries, of which 66% did not receive due treatment. Many open fractures of the lower extremities were not fixed with splints during transportation, which aggravated pain and trauma, hindering subsequent treatment. Traction was often not used in the treatment of femoral fractures, resulting in deformed and shortened limbs, causing disability. Even more serious was that amputations were performed when they should not have been, or the amputation sites were too high, resulting in the unnecessary sacrifice of useful limbs and joints. These facts, which violated medical principles, prove that the US military was completely irresponsible for the medical treatment of sick and wounded prisoners of war. For example, frostbite was not only common in prisoner-of-war camps (139 cases), but the majority (70%) were treated with high-level amputations, completely violating the principles that should govern the treatment of frostbite. The US side should be fully responsible for the pain and disabilities caused to our returning personnel by the irresponsibility and incorrect treatment of the US military.

The US military subjected prisoners of war to all kinds of extremely brutal atrocities, completely violating the fair and reasonable provisions of the Geneva Convention regarding the treatment of prisoners of war. The US military also brutally inflicted various vicious atrocities on sick and wounded prisoners of war. For example, in internal medicine cases, there were 230 cases of tuberculosis. The widespread occurrence and development of tuberculosis were inseparable from the nutritional deficiencies and poor living environment in the prisoner-of-war camps. More importantly, most of the patients had been subjected to forced labor, poison gas, beatings, forced feeding of chili water, deprivation of water, deprivation of food, and other atrocities during their captivity, before and during their illness. Therefore, in these cases, many patients with pulmonary tuberculosis developed active and severe pulmonary tuberculosis. If the US military had complied with the minimum requirements of the Geneva Convention regarding the treatment of prisoners of war, the vast majority of pulmonary tuberculosis cases would not have occurred.

From this, it can be seen that the deficiencies in the supplies provided by the US military caused widespread and serious nutritional deficiencies among prisoners of war, the negligence, errors, and irresponsibility of the US military in medical care caused undue pain and disabilities to the prisoners of war, and the atrocities of the US military promoted the occurrence and development of diseases among the prisoners of war. All of these illustrate that the US military completely violated the Geneva Convention and its inhumanity. This is intolerable to the righteous people of the world, and this is the reason why we should file charges.

    斥美军虐待战俘的罪行
    内科教授  刘士豪
    美军虐待我方被俘人员的罪行又一次揭露了美帝国主义的狰狞面貌。朝鲜停战以后，一部分中国人民志愿军被俘人员先后回国，他们在美军战俘营中所身受的暴行和因美军医疗上的不负责任及错误的处理而造成的严重后果，达到极其惊人的程度。为了解决归来的伤病被俘人员的医疗问题，中国红十字会曾聘请国内各科专家进行了检查。在一六○九名归国的伤病员的身体检查中，发现美军对待我方被俘人员惨无人道，违反日内瓦公约对待战俘的规定。这主要表现在战俘的营养缺乏、美军医疗上的不负责和对战俘的各种暴行。
    各科专家还对归来的非伤病被俘人员进行了检查。这批非伤病员计有一○四五名，一般都是瘦弱，苍白，营养不良，体重普遍减轻。百分之八十以上人员在回国二十余日后，因为营养改善体重即有显著的增加，其余没有增加者都是因为原来患有严重的营养不良性水肿，虽然回国后营养改善，水肿消失，而体重仍没有增加。贫血也极普遍，血红蛋白平均为一○点三克，在十二克以下者占百分之八十多，在十一克以下者占百分之六十以上，在十克以下者占百分之四十以上。这些非伤病员也普遍地表现维生素缺乏症，尤以维生素甲及核黄素缺乏症为甚。甲种维生素缺乏症几达百分之九十之多，其中百分之五十二点二有夜盲症，百分之六十三点一有皮肤毛囊角化症，百分之四十九点九有干眼病或毕脱氏斑。核黄素缺乏症患者占非伤病员总数的百分之七十九点七，其表现为唇角炎、口腔炎、舌炎、阴囊皮炎等。总之营养缺乏症极其严重和普遍。根据曾在战俘营中充当炊事员的归来人员的陈述，美军供给战俘的食物不但质量不够，数量也不够，蛋白质和脂肪都远不足营养最低的要求，各种维生素都很缺少，尤其是甲种维生素和核黄素只有正常需要量的十分之一。这种事实可以完全说明我们所目睹的极端严重和普遍的营养缺乏症。非伤病员吃这样的食物，伤病员也吃同样的食物，更妨碍病伤的痊愈。一九四九年八月十二日日内瓦公约二十六条规定：“每日基本口粮在量、质与种类上应足够保持战俘健康及防止体重之减轻或营养不足。”美军在食物供应上违反了日内瓦公约，造成了战俘的普遍严重的营养缺乏病，是应当负完全责任的。
    在战俘的医疗上，美军所犯的罪行更属严重。在伤病员中有一一七二例外科病，五六七例内科病。在外科病例中，六三七例为骨和关节创伤，其中百分之六十六没有得到应有的治疗。很多的下肢开放性骨折在输送中没有夹板固定，以致痛苦和创伤加重，妨害以后的治疗。治疗股骨骨折时常不用牵引，以致病肢畸形短缩，造成残废。更严重的是不应当截肢的截了肢，或截肢的部位太高，以致无故而牺牲有用的肢体和关节。这些违反医疗原则的事实，证明美军对病伤战俘的医疗毫不负责。如冻伤在战俘营中不仅普遍（一三九例），而且大多数
  （占百分之七十）以高部位的截肢为处理方法，完全违反了治疗冻伤应有的原则。由美军的不负责任和错误处理所造成的我方归来人员的痛苦和残废，应由美方完全负责。
    美军对战俘施行各式各样的极端凶恶的暴行，完全违反了日内瓦公约对待战俘的公平合理的规定。美军对伤病的战俘也同样地横施以各种毒辣的暴行。例如在内科病例中，有二三○例为结核病。结核病如此普遍地发生和发展，是与战俘营中的营养缺乏及生活环境恶劣分不开的，更重要的是大多数的患者在被俘期间，在病前和病中曾受强迫劳役、毒气、鞭打、灌辣椒水、断水、断食及其他暴行。因此，在这些病例中，很多肺结核患者均发展为活动性的厉害的肺结核。如果美军遵照日内瓦公约关于对待战俘的最低要求，则绝大部分的肺结核不会发生。
    由此可见，美军供应的缺乏造成战俘普遍的严重的营养缺乏病和美军医疗上的疏忽、错误、不负责而给战俘造成的不应有的痛苦和残废，以及美军的暴行促使战俘疾病的发生和发展，都说明了美军完全违反了日内瓦公约和它的惨无人道。这是全世界正义的人民所不能容忍的，这就是我们应当提出控诉的理由。
