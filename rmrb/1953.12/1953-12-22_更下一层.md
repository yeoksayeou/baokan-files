Go Deeper

Ma Tieding

Many cadres have gone to the countryside and factories; this is a good thing. Generally speaking, going down is always better than not going down.

But how should they go down?

Some cadres' usual practice when going to the countryside is: first talk to the branch secretary or township head, then convene a meeting of cadres, then convene a meeting of Party and Youth League members, then convene a mass meeting, and then talk to the branch secretary and township head again. Then, they go to another township. In this way, apart from holding large meetings, the people they come into contact with are always only the branch secretary, branch committee members, township head, and cadres; the space in which they operate is often limited to within the gates of the township people's government.

As for going to factories, it is not uncommon for the offices of the workshop director and branch secretary to be the "end" of their "going down."

Of course, talking with the branch secretary, branch committee members, workshop director, township head, etc., and holding necessary meetings of this kind, are all indispensable steps. However, is this enough? I don't think it is.

Why is it not enough? It is because doing only this cannot deeply understand the thoughts, opinions, and demands of the masses. The talk of cadres can also reflect some, but it is often not reflected very completely; Party, and Youth League members meetings and mass meetings can also reflect some, but they are often not reflected very completely either. In this way, it is often impossible to discover problems more deeply, to see the real achievements, weaknesses, and mistakes in the work more specifically, and therefore, solving problems is often superficial.

In order to overcome this shortcoming, it is necessary to "go deeper," to go from the cadre level to the broad masses, from the meeting level to the daily lives of the masses. Talk heart-to-heart with some ordinary Party and Youth League members and the masses, deeply understand their thoughts, opinions, and demands, and then compare them with the materials reflected by the cadres. This makes it easier to understand the true nature of things. The requirement to "go deeper" is not a new requirement. When land reform was implemented in the past, some places put forward slogans such as "visiting the poor and asking about suffering" and "making friends"; some places implemented "three togethers" (eat together, live together, work together). Of course, it is not necessary to adhere to fixed forms here, but that hard-working and simple, down-to-earth, and mass-oriented style will always be our glorious tradition. Today, in the face of new situations and new tasks, cadres must maintain and carry forward this tradition.

    更下一层
    马铁丁
    许多干部都下乡下厂了，这是好事情。一般说来，下去总比不下去好。
    但是，怎样下法呢？
    有些干部下乡的惯例是：先找支部书记或乡长谈谈，然后召开一个干部会议，然后再开一个党、团员大会，然后再开个群众大会，然后再找支部书记、乡长谈谈，于是，到别的乡去。这样，除了开大会以外，他们所接触的人物，总不外是支部书记、支部委员、乡长、干部；他们活动的空间，往往局限于乡人民政府的大门内。
    至于下厂，以车间主任和支部书记的办公室为“下去”的尽头的，也并非罕见。
    当然，找支部书记、支部委员、车间主任、乡长等等谈谈，开这样那样必要的会议，都是不可少的一步。然而，这样就够了吗？我看是不够的。
    为什么不够？就是因为仅仅这样做还不能深入地了解群众的思想、意见和要求。干部的谈话，也可以反映一些，但往往反映得不很完全；党、团员大会和群众大会，也可以反映一些，但也往往不能反映得很完全。这样，就往往不能更深入地发现问题，更具体地看到工作中的真正成绩、弱点和错误，因而解决问题，也往往是浮面的。
    为了克服这个缺点，就需要“更下一层”，要从干部这一层再下到广大群众中去，从会议这一层再下到群众的日常生活中去。找一些普通的党、团员和群众谈谈心，深入地了解他们的思想、意见和要求，然后把它们与干部所反映的材料相印证，这就比较容易了解事物的真实面貌了。要求“更下一层”，并不是什么新的要求，当年实行土地改革时，有的地方曾提出“访贫问苦”、“交朋友”等等的口号；有的地方实行
  “三同”（同吃、同住、同劳动）。这里当然不必拘泥于固定的形式，但是，那种艰苦朴素、脚踏实地、深入群众的作风，却永远是我们的光荣传统。今天，在新形势和新任务面前，干部们更要保持和发扬这种传统。
