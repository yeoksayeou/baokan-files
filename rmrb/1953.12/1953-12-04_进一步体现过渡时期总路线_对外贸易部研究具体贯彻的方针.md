    Further Embodying the General Line of the Transition Period
    Ministry of Foreign Trade Studies Specific Implementation Policies

    The Central Ministry of Foreign Trade recently held a reporting conference of special commissioners from major regions and ports to study how to further embody the general line of the transition period in foreign trade work, and how to complete this year's procurement and export tasks.

    The conference clearly pointed out that to further embody the general line of the transition period in foreign trade work, the following five tasks must be done well: (1) Continue to implement foreign trade controls and protective trade policies in order to protect China's economic construction from foreign trade and prevent imperialist sabotage in the economy. (2) Actively and systematically organize internal and external exchanges. In import work, efforts should be concentrated on serving industrial construction, especially heavy industrial construction. On this premise, appropriately import some equipment needed for the development of agriculture and light industry, and some daily necessities that the broad masses of people urgently need but that are currently not available or not fully available domestically. In export work, it is necessary to actively organize the export of local and special products under the principles of coordinating the entire economic construction, closely integrating domestic and foreign sales, and taking overall consideration. (3) Develop trade with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries in a planned and proportional manner, and continue to place it in a primary position, in order to guarantee the import of factory equipment and industrial materials necessary for China's industrialization and to strengthen China's economic cooperation and mutual assistance with fraternal countries; at the same time, develop trade with capitalist countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, ensuring that it is politically and economically beneficial to our country. (4) Continue to increase the proportion of state-owned foreign trade in a step-by-step manner, and systematically carry out socialist transformation of private import and export businesses, and ban speculative and destructive activities in import and export businesses. (5) Strive to accumulate funds for national industrial construction, which requires continuous improvement of business management, the step-by-step implementation of economic accounting systems, accelerating capital turnover, practicing thrift, reducing costs, increasing income, and completing the task of turning over profits. The conference also pointed out that foreign trade cadres must conscientiously study the general line and general tasks of the transition period, and should organize private import and export merchants to study under the unified leadership of various regions, so as to correctly implement the general line and fight against all phenomena that violate and distort the general line of the transition period.

    Regarding how to complete this year's procurement and export tasks, the conference emphasized that in addition to continuing to implement the Central Ministry of Foreign Trade's instructions on autumn procurement work, the following points should be done well: (1) Correctly strengthen the management of the domestic market. For some illegal merchants who violate national policies and laws by raising prices and搶購物资 (qiǎnggòu wùzī - rushing to purchase goods), in addition to exposing their destructive behavior to the masses, the local industrial and commercial administrative departments should stop them and impose penalties as appropriate, so that the market can be normally active under the leadership of the state-owned economy. (2) It is recommended that the local financial and economic committees should pay close attention to the procurement of export native products during the centralized procurement of grain and cotton, and make appropriate arrangements. State-owned foreign trade units should take the initiative to strengthen contact with commercial departments and cooperatives, and closely integrate domestic and foreign sales. (4) Actively purchase according to plan. Some commodities (such as hogs) should appropriately expand the procurement area, and some commodities should appropriately adjust prices to steadily restore processing. (5) Conscientiously check the implementation of this year's export contracts, make transportation plans, and ensure the completion of export tasks. (Chen Ming, Zhang Weiqi)

    进一步体现过渡时期总路线
    对外贸易部研究具体贯彻的方针
    中央对外贸易部在近日召开的各大区各口岸特派员汇报会议上研究了如何进一步在对外贸易工作中体现过渡时期总路线，并研究了如何完成今年全年的收购、出口任务。
    会议明确指出：要在对外贸易工作中进一步体现过渡时期总路线，必须作好以下五项工作：（一）继续贯彻对外贸易管制及保护贸易政策，以便从对外贸易方面保护我国经济建设，防止帝国主义在经济上的捣乱。（二）积极地有计划地组织内外交流。在进口工作上要集中力量为工业建设特别是为重工业建设服务，在此前提下适当进口一些为发展农业、轻工业所需要的器材和广大人民迫切需要但目前国内尚不能供应或尚不能完全供应的某些日用必需品。在出口工作上必须在配合整个经济建设及密切内外销结合和统筹兼顾的原则下积极组织土特产输出。（三）有计划地按比例地发展与苏联和人民民主国家的贸易，并继续把它放在首要地位，以保障我国工业化所必需的工厂设备与工业器材进口和密切我国与兄弟国家的经济合作互助；同时，在平等互利基础上与资本主义国家发展贸易，保证在政治上、经济上对我国有利。（四）有步骤地继续增强国营对外贸易比重，并有计划地对私营进出口商业逐步进行社会主义改造，取缔进出口商业中的投机破坏活动。（五）努力为国家工业建设积累资金，这就要不断改善经营管理，有步骤地推行经济核算制，加速资金周转，厉行节约，降低成本，增加收入，完成上缴利润任务。会议还指出对外贸易干部必须认真学习过渡时期的总路线总任务，并要在各地统一领导下组织私营进出口商学习，以便能正确贯彻总路线，并与一切违反和曲解过渡时期总路线的现象作斗争。
    关于如何完成今年全年收购、出口任务，会议强调指出，除继续贯彻中央对外贸易部关于秋后收购工作指示外，要作好以下几点：（一）正确加强对国内市场管理，对一些不遵守国家政策法令抬价抢购物资的违法商人，除应向群众揭露其破坏行为外，各地工商行政部门应加以制止，并酌情惩处，使市场能在国营经济领导下正常地活跃起来。（二）建议各地财政经济委员会在集中收购粮、棉中应对出口土产的收购抓紧季节，加以适当安排。国营对外贸易各单位应主动地与商业部各单位、合作社加强联系，密切内外销结合。（四）积极地按计划收购，有些商品（如毛猪）应适当扩大收购地区，有些商品应适当调整价格，稳步地恢复加工。（五）认真检查今年出口合同的执行情况，作好运输计划，保证出口任务的完成。  （陈明  张维奇）
