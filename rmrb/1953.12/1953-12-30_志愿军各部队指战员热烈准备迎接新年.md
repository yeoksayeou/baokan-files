In the warm "Home of the Position," many company-level soldiers have pasted up brand-new New Year's pictures and slogans, making their residences look completely new. Many cadres and soldiers are happily rehearsing various recreational programs, preparing to perform at the New Year's Eve celebrations. The Volunteer Army unit on the front line of "Dingzi Mountain" specifically wrote a New Year's greeting letter to Chairman Mao on the eve of the New Year, guaranteeing to heighten their vigilance, strictly guard their positions, and defend the construction of the motherland and world peace. A Volunteer Army unit on the Tieyuan front held a hero and model conference on the eve of the New Year to summarize their work over the past year. A Volunteer Army unit guarding the east coast has printed a large number of New Year's cards, preparing to send them to the families of meritorious personnel to celebrate the New Year. The company where first-class hero Huang Jiafu is located has rehearsed many recreational programs on the eve of the New Year, including dragon dances, lion dances, stilt walking, and Yangko dances, preparing to perform with fraternal units on New Year's Day. Second-class hero Ma Xinnian and first-class meritorious person Wang Shiyou, who returned home to attend the National Day celebrations this year, are preparing to introduce the great achievements of the motherland's construction to their comrades on New Year's Day. In addition, many Volunteer Army units are also preparing to hold sports meets during the New Year to further develop the army's sports activities.

    During the New Year, Volunteer Army commanders and fighters will also write letters home to celebrate the New Year and promote the general line of the country during the transition period to their families. Second-class hero Yi Caixue, special-class meritorious person Chen Zhen'an, and others have all written letters before the New Year to encourage their families to sell their surplus grain to the state and take the road of mutual aid and cooperation. They also mobilized their relatives to actively subscribe to the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds.

    The Volunteer Army units are also preparing to comfort the Korean people near their garrisons during the New Year. A Volunteer Army unit on the Jin-cheng front has allocated a batch of grain to send to the people in the war zone who have returned to their homes after the armistice. The various cultural troupes and teams of this unit will also perform for the Korean people in this area during the New Year to express their condolences. A Volunteer Army unit on the Shangganling front is preparing to pay New Year's greetings to the family of the immortal internationalist fighter Park Jae-keun and the support-the-front model Shi Jirong on the eve of the New Year, and to present them with honorary plaques and various gifts. A Volunteer Army unit on the east coast has also prepared many honorary plaques and honorary flowers, ready to present them to the families of the Korean People's Army near their garrison on New Year's Day.

    While the commanders and fighters of the various units are enthusiastically preparing to celebrate the New Year, they are more vigilantly guarding their positions. They all stated: We must not relax our vigilance against the enemy; we will protect the motherland and the Korean people so they can peacefully celebrate the first victorious New Year after the Korean armistice.
