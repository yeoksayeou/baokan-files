    Outstanding Soviet Writer Mikhail Ilyin Passes Away
    [Xinhua News Agency News] The Soviet "Literary Gazette" reports: The outstanding Soviet writer, one of the founders of Soviet science popularization literature, Mikhail Ilyin (Ilya Yakovlevich Marshak), passed away on November 15th at the age of fifty-eight.
    Ilyin engaged in literary activities for thirty years, writing many outstanding works. Among the works well-known to Soviet readers are: "Story of the Five-Year Plan," "Man and the Mountain," "Man's Conquest of Nature," "Man and Nature," etc. He was a writer with a high level of culture, outstanding talent, and rare work ethic. In his works, he vividly explored Gorky's theme – the powerful strength of the wisdom of free people, which is transforming nature for the victory of communism. Gorky paid close attention to Ilyin's writings and gave a high evaluation of his "Story of the Five-Year Plan," saying:
  "'Story of the Five-Year Plan' has achieved outstanding success because Ilyin has the rare talent of explaining complex phenomena and difficult things in a simple and clear way."
    Ilyin's rarest talent made him a writer loved and respected by Soviet young readers. Like any great children's writer, Ilyin was also a writer loved and respected by adults. Ilyin's works are not only widely popular in the Soviet Union but have also been published in large quantities abroad many times. Romain Rolland commented on Ilyin's "Story of the Five-Year Plan," saying: "No book has written so vividly and popularly about the great significance of Soviet heroic work."
    The Soviet government awarded Ilyin the Order of the Red Banner of Labor and the "Glorious Labor in the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945" medal for his great contributions to literary development.
    Ilyin, this outstanding writer, was a tireless worker throughout his life, a great social activist who loved life, loved labor, and loved the people.

    卓越的苏联作家米哈伊尔·伊林逝世
    【新华社讯】苏联“文学报”消息：卓越的苏联作家、苏联介绍科学的文艺的创始人之一米哈伊尔·伊林（伊里亚·雅科夫列维奇·马尔夏克）于十一月十五日逝世，享年五十八岁。
    伊林从事文学活动三十年，写出了许多卓越的作品。其中为苏联读者熟知的作品有：“五年计划的故事”、“人和山”、“人类征服自然”、“人和自然”等。他是一个具有高度文化水平、杰出的天才和罕见的劳动能力的作家，他在自己的作品中鲜明地发掘了高尔基的主题——获得自由的人的智慧的强大力量，这种智慧正在为了共产主义的胜利而改造自然。高尔基极其注意伊林的著作，对他的
  “五年计划的故事”作了崇高的评价，高尔基说：
  “‘五年计划的故事’之所以获得突出的成就，是因为伊林有把复杂的现象和难解的事物讲说得简单明了的罕见才能。”
    伊林的这种最罕见的才能，使他成为苏联青年读者所喜爱和崇敬的作家。伊林像任何一个伟大的儿童作家一样，同样也是为成年人所喜爱和崇敬的作家。伊林的作品不但在苏联广泛地流行着，并在外国多次地大量出版。罗曼·罗兰评论伊林的“五年计划的故事”这本书时说：“没有一本书像这样鲜明和通俗地写出苏联的英雄工作的伟大意义。”
    苏联政府因为伊林在文艺发展中的伟大功绩，曾授予他劳动红旗勋章和“一九四一—一九四五年伟大卫国战争时期的光荣劳动”奖章。
    伊林这位卓越的作家终生是一个孜孜不倦的劳动者，是一个热爱生活热爱劳动热爱人民的伟大的社会活动家。
