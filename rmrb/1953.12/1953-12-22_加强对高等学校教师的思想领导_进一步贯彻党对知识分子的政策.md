    Strengthen Ideological Leadership over University Teachers
    Further Implement the Party's Policy on Intellectuals
    The basic task of universities during the transition period is to cultivate a sufficient number and quality of senior construction talents to ensure the implementation of the national general line and the completion of the first Five-Year Plan. The realization of this task depends on the Party organizations in universities further implementing the Party's policy on intellectuals, strengthening the unity of new and old teachers, adopting a correct attitude towards old teachers, giving full play to the abilities of all teachers, and striving to cultivate a large number of new teachers.
    In the four years since liberation, the Party organizations in universities have generally correctly implemented the Party's policy on intellectuals. Precisely because of this, teachers have been able to play a role that was impossible for them to play before, and through various political movements, especially the ideological remolding study movement, they have been greatly improved politically and ideologically. However, there are still many Party organizations in universities and some Party member cadres who are responsible for school leadership who have not seriously implemented the Party's policy on intellectuals, and some comrades have even violated this policy. These comrades, in their interactions with old teachers, showed pride and arrogance, were overbearing, did not humbly learn from the strengths of old teachers, did not actively help them to progress, and even often treated them with a rude attitude. Some comrades also adopted an attitude of unprincipled accommodation towards old teachers, failing to make necessary criticisms of the old teachers' erroneous ideas, and failing to adopt a truly concerned attitude towards the ideological remolding of old teachers. As a result, the relationship between Party members and the masses, and the relationship between new and old teachers in some schools, have been in an abnormal state for a considerable period of time, affecting the progress of old teachers, hindering the full play of old teachers' enthusiasm, and bringing undue losses to the improvement of teaching quality and the cultivation of new teachers, and even the entire higher education cause.
    Some comrades took a rude attitude towards old teachers because they did not know that, through teaching and scientific research work, old teachers can play a certain positive role in training young experts and young teachers, in solving theoretical and technical problems of applied science for economic construction, and in improving our country's cultural and scientific level. Old teachers can play such a role because, on the one hand, they generally have a certain amount of cultural and scientific knowledge, have certain teaching experience and research capabilities, and some old teachers are nationally known scholars and experts with certain achievements in academics and relatively rich scientific knowledge; on the other hand, their working conditions and their thinking have changed and are continuing to change. Since liberation, our higher education has broken away from the semi-colonial and semi-feudal track, and is now following the general line of the transition period indicated by Comrade Mao Zedong, adapting to the needs of socialist construction, and gradually transforming into socialist higher education. Its guiding ideology and education policy have undergone fundamental changes, and the teaching content, teaching methods, etc. have also undergone important changes through teaching reform and are continuing to change. Old teachers have generally drawn a clear line between ourselves and the enemy ideologically, and have realized the importance of learning from Soviet advanced science and the reactionary and backward nature of Anglo-American bourgeois scientific thought. Some old teachers who have made faster progress have also initially mastered Soviet textbooks and become the backbone of teaching work in various universities. Therefore, Party organizations in universities should have a correct assessment of the role of old teachers and strive to guide them to better play their talents and do more work for the country.
    Some comrades cannot see the role of old teachers in national construction because they regard whether or not they have mastered Marxism-Leninism as the only criterion for measuring old teachers. This requirement is obviously divorced from reality. Old teachers who have lived in old China for a long time, due to various subjective and objective reasons, have not been able to contact or cannot contact Marxism-Leninism more. It is impossible for them to master it in the short few years after liberation. So, how should we look at old teachers? In his article "The Role and Tasks of Trade Unions under the New Economic Policy," written in 1922, Lenin pointed out that as long as the original experts "work honestly, understand their profession, and love their profession," we should cherish them. The situation in the Soviet Union at that time was certainly different from our country today, but we should understand the spirit indicated by Lenin. When we look at old teachers, we should first look at whether they "work honestly, understand their profession, and love their profession." In this way, we will see that many old teachers sincerely want to do their work well and are indeed working hard. As long as they reform their thinking well, they can completely do more things for the country and the people. Therefore, we should also cherish these old teachers as Lenin taught. Of course, we also very much hope that old teachers can master Marxism-Leninism, because only in this way can they better play their role. But this hope can only be gradually realized by relying on our patient help and the old teachers' conscious long-term learning. We must never take a hasty attitude and treat the standards that can only be achieved in the future as today's standards.
    Party organizations in universities must make every Party member realize that our Party attaches great importance to the role of intellectuals in revolution and construction. Therefore, it has consistently adopted a policy of winning over, uniting, and transforming them, guiding them to combine with workers and peasants and serve workers and peasants. When Party members in universities get along with non-Party old teachers, they should conscientiously implement the Party's policy, respect old teachers, care for old teachers, humbly learn from them, and help them to carry out ideological remolding, and help them to do their work well. They must never take a rude attitude towards them. The Party's policy of uniting and transforming intellectuals is unified and cannot be understood one-sidedly. It is certainly wrong to talk about transformation without unity; and it is also wrong to talk about unity without transformation. Because old teachers are all people who come from the old society, most of them have been deeply influenced by European and American bourgeois education, so that whether in political or academic thinking, there are still many European and American bourgeois views. The root cause of why some old teachers have shown a strong conservative ideology in the process of learning from the Soviet Union lies here. Therefore, Party organizations in universities should conscientiously help old teachers carry out ideological remolding, otherwise it will be impossible for them to work better for the country, and they themselves will not be able to make faster progress. Promoting the ideological remolding of old teachers and eliminating reactionary bourgeois ideas is an important task of universities throughout the transition period, and it is also the main aspect of the ideological struggle in the field of education. We must achieve victory in this area in order to push the cause of higher education forward. Some ideologically progressive old teachers have already felt that some communists "take care of them too much, but do not help them enough." Their eagerness to reform their thinking is obvious, and we should give them practical help in this regard.
    The fundamental way to transform the thinking of old teachers is to conscientiously organize them to study Marxism-Leninism. In the process of organizing them to study, we must oppose the mentality of eagerness for quick success that exists among them, and we must also oppose the mentality of being unwilling to study hard in practice under the pretext of the long-term nature of theoretical study. We must help old teachers truly realize that theoretical study is an arduous mental labor. It is impossible to learn anything without continuous hard work. And this continuous hard work depends on the old teachers maximizing their consciousness. Generally speaking, they have a consciousness of learning Marxism-Leninism today, and their enthusiasm for learning is clear evidence. Of course, we must also "always keep in mind that the path experienced by engineers in acknowledging communist ideas is not the same as that experienced by propagandists and writers who worked in secret conditions in the past, but through the practical results they have achieved in their own field of science, for example, agronomists acknowledge communist ideas along their own path, silviculturists acknowledge communist ideas along their own path, and so on." This famous point made by Lenin in his article "On a Unified Economic Plan" has also been proven in the practice of old teachers in universities in our country. Some old teachers have seen in the process of learning advanced Soviet science and technology that many departments of engineering science have made great progress in the Soviet Union, but capitalist countries have not had any new developments in the past one or two decades. As for scientific theory, that goes without saying. Thus, they realized that only under the socialist system and under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism can science have infinitely broad prospects for development. Therefore, conscientiously organizing old teachers to study advanced Soviet science and technology is not only an important link in improving teaching quality, but also an important link in transforming and improving their thinking.
    Since the central work of the school is teaching, doing a good job in teaching is the basic task of teachers and their basic requirement; and the purpose of uniting and transforming teachers is primarily for teaching, so the work of uniting and transforming teachers should be carried out around teaching work. Party organizations in universities should take all possible methods to enable old teachers to fully play their enthusiasm in teaching, and in the process, help them learn to use the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint to continuously improve teaching quality. This requires communists in universities to work hard, humbly learn from old teachers, in order to master their profession, so as to achieve the goal of mutual help and common progress between new and old teachers and running universities well. For old teachers who are currently unable to teach, the school administration should be advised to give them the opportunity to study and prepare for teaching in the future; for old teachers who have difficulty teaching but can conduct research work, they should be given the opportunity to conduct research work; and for some old teachers who are not suitable for teaching work, consideration should be given to assigning other appropriate work to give play to their talents in other areas. In short, appropriate arrangements should be made for all kinds of old teachers to enable them to play a role.
    All old teachers should also know that actively participating in national construction and contributing their knowledge and experience to the magnificent cause of socialist industrialization is their glorious duty. And the size of their contribution to the country depends on whether they sincerely and conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism, learn advanced Soviet science and technology and educational experience, transform their thinking, and carry out creative teaching and scientific research work. Old teachers should clearly recognize their serious shortcomings in thinking, consciously carry out long-term and arduous ideological remolding, eliminate bourgeois viewpoints, and strive to become a Marxist-Leninist teacher.
    The task of cultivating senior construction talents undertaken by universities is very arduous, and the quantity and quality of teachers are not sufficient at present. Under such circumstances, we must fully tap the potential, and strengthening the unity of all teachers and giving full play to their enthusiasm is one of the important methods to tap the potential of the school. Therefore, the role of old teachers in national construction should be valued and given full play. However, this alone cannot meet the growing demand for teachers in our country's higher education. Because the number of original teachers is very small, and their knowledge is also limited to a certain extent. Therefore, universities must also actively train a large number of new teachers in order to fundamentally overcome the difficulties of teachers and better promote the ideological remolding of old teachers. In this work, Party organizations in universities should educate new teachers to humbly learn from old teachers, and at the same time educate old teachers to recognize their responsibility for training new teachers, actively help new teachers, so that new and old teachers can learn from each other's strengths, unite and work together to run universities well, and complete the glorious task of cultivating senior construction talents.

    加强对高等学校教师的思想领导
    进一步贯彻党对知识分子的政策
    高等学校在过渡时期的基本任务，是培养足够数量和具有一定质量的高级建设人才，以保证国家总路线的贯彻和第一个五年计划的完成。这一任务的实现，有赖于高等学校中的党组织进一步贯彻执行党对知识分子的政策，加强新老教师的团结，对老教师采取正确的态度，充分发挥全体教师的能力，并努力培养大批新的师资。
    在解放后的四年中，高等学校中的党组织，一般是正确地执行了党对知识分子的政策的。正因为这样，才使教师们发挥了他们在以前所不可能发挥的作用，并经过各种政治运动，特别是思想改造的学习运动，帮助他们在政治上、思想上大大地提高了一步。但是也还有不少高等学校的党组织和某些担负学校领导工作的党员干部，没有认真执行党对知识分子的政策，有些同志甚至违背了这一政策。这些同志在和老教师相处当中，表现了骄傲自大，盛气凌人，不去虚心地学习老教师的长处，也不主动地帮助他们进步，甚至常常用粗暴的态度对待他们。也有些同志对老教师采取了无原则的迁就态度，对老教师的错误思想，没有进行必要的批评，对老教师的思想改造，没有采取真正关切的态度。这样一来，就使一部分学校的党团员和群众的关系，新教师和老教师的关系，在相当长的时间内都处于不够正常的状态，影响了老教师的进步，妨碍了老教师积极性的发挥，给提高教学质量和培养新师资的工作以至整个高等教育事业带来了不应有的损失。
    有些同志之所以对老教师采取了粗暴的态度，是因为他们不知道，通过教学和科学研究工作，老教师在培养青年专家和青年教师方面，在为经济建设解决应用科学的理论和技术问题方面，在提高我们国家的文化水平和科学水平方面，都能够发挥一定的积极作用。老教师所以能够发挥这样的作用，一方面是因为他们一般具有一定的文化的和科学的知识，具有一定的教学经验和研究能力，若干老教师并且是全国知名的学者和专家，在学术上有一定的成就，科学知识比较丰富；另一方面是因为他们的工作条件和他们的思想已经变化并且正在继续变化。从解放以后，我们的高等教育已经脱离了半殖民地半封建的轨道，现在正遵循着毛泽东同志所指示的过渡时期的总路线，适应社会主义建设事业的需要，逐步地转变为社会主义的高等教育。它的领导思想、教育方针已经发生了根本变化，教学内容、教学方法等等也经过教学改革发生了重要变化，并且正在继续变化。老教师在思想上一般地已经划清了敌我界限，并认识到学习苏联先进科学的重要性，认识到英美资产阶级科学思想的反动性和落后性，有些进步较快的老教师，并且已经初步掌握了苏联教材，成为各高等学校教学工作中的骨干力量。所以，高等学校中的党组织对老教师的作用应该有正确的估计，并努力引导他们更好地发挥自己的才能，为国家作更多的工作。
    一部分同志所以看不清老教师在国家建设中的作用，还因为他们把是否已经掌握马克思列宁主义当作了衡量老教师的唯一的标准。这种要求显然是脱离实际的。长时期生活在旧中国的老教师，由于种种主观和客观的原因，没有能够接触或不能更多地接触马克思列宁主义，要让他们在解放后短短的几年间就掌握它，这是不可能的。那末，怎样看待老教师呢？列宁在一九二二年所写的“新经济政策下职工会底作用与任务”一文曾经指出，只要原有的专家们“诚实工作、通晓本业并酷爱本业”，我们就应该爱护他们。苏联当时的情况和我国今天的情况当然不同，但是列宁所指示的这种精神，我们应该好好领会。我们看老教师，也应该首先看他们是否“诚实工作、通晓本业并酷爱本业”。这样我们就会看到，许多老教师确实是诚心诚意地想把工作作好，并且也确实是在努力工作，只要他们好好改造思想，就完全可以为国家和人民作更多的事情，因而我们也应该像列宁所教导的那样去爱护这些老教师。当然，我们也十分希望老教师能够掌握马克思列宁主义，因为只有这样，他们才有可能更好地发挥自己的作用。但这种希望只有依靠我们耐心的帮助和老教师自觉的长期学习才能逐步实现，决不能采取急躁态度，把将来才能达到的标准当作今天的标准。
    高等学校的党组织必须使每一个党员认识，我们党是十分重视知识分子在革命和建设中的作用的，所以对他们一贯采取争取、团结、改造的政策，引导他们和工农结合，为工农服务。高等学校的党员在和非党的老教师相处当中，应该认真执行党的政策，尊重老教师，关心老教师，虚心地向他们学习，并帮助他们进行思想改造，帮助他们把工作作好，决不能对他们采取粗暴态度。党对知识分子团结改造的政策，是统一的，不能作片面的理解。离开团结来谈改造，固然是不对的；而离开改造来谈团结，也是不对的。因为老教师都是来自旧社会的人，他们当中的绝大部分都受了欧美资产阶级教育的深重影响，以致不论在政治思想上或学术思想上，至今都还存在着许多欧美资产阶级的观点，一部分老教师在学习苏联的过程中，所以表现了浓厚的保守思想，其根本原因就在这里。所以高等学校的党组织应该认真地帮助老教师进行思想改造，否则就不可能使他们更好地为国家工作，他们自己也不可能更快地进步。推动老教师的思想改造，清除资产阶级的反动思想，乃是高等学校在整个过渡时期的重要任务，也是教育领域内思想斗争的主要方面，我们必须在这方面取得胜利，才能把高等教育事业推向前进。有些思想进步的老教师已经感到有些共产党员对他们“照顾有余，帮助不足”。他们改造思想的热望是显然的，我们应该在这方面给他们以切实的帮助。
    改造老教师思想的根本办法是认真地组织他们学习马克思列宁主义。在组织他们学习的过程中，要反对存在于他们中间的急于求成的思想，也要反对藉口理论学习的长期性而实际上不愿努力学习的思想。要帮助老教师真正认识理论学习是一种艰苦的精神劳动，没有持续的苦功，是不可能学到什么东西的。而这种持续的苦功，则依靠于老教师最大限度地发扬自觉性。一般说，今天他们是有学习马克思列宁主义的自觉性的，他们的学习热情就是明证。自然，我们也必须“时刻记着一点，即工程师承认共产主义思想所经历的途径并不像从前那些在秘密条件下工作的宣传员和著作家所经历的一样，而是经过他在自己那一门科学方面所达到的实际成果，例如农艺学家是循着自己的途径来承认共产主义思想的，植林学家是循着自己的途径来承认共产主义思想的等等”。列宁在“论统一经济计划”一文中的这一著名论点，在我国高等学校老教师的实践中也得到了证明。若干老教师在学习苏联的先进科学技术的过程中看到，工程科学的许多部门在苏联已有长足的进步，但资本主义国家，近一二十年中却根本没有什么新的发展。至于在科学理论方面，那更不用说了。从而他们认识到，只有在社会主义制度下，在马克思列宁主义的指导下，科学才有着无比广阔的发展前途。因此，认真地组织老教师学习苏联先进的科学技术，不仅是提高教学质量的重要环节，而且是改造和提高他们的思想的重要环节。
    由于学校的中心工作是教学，搞好教学是教师的基本任务，也是他们的基本要求；而团结和改造教师的目的首先也是为了教学，所以团结和改造教师的工作，应该围绕着教学工作来进行。高等学校的党组织应该采取一切可能的方法，使老教师能够充分发挥在教学方面的积极性，并在这当中，帮助他们学习运用马克思列宁主义的观点，不断地提高教学质量。这就要求高等学校的共产党员努力钻研，虚心地向老教师学习，以便掌握业务，达到新老教师互相帮助、共同前进、办好高等学校的目的。对于目前暂时还不能开课的老教师，则应该建议学校行政方面给他们以进修的机会，准备将来开课；对于开课困难而能进行研究工作的老教师，则应该给予进行研究工作的机会；对某些不适于从事教学工作的老教师，则应考虑分配其他的适当工作，以发挥他们在其他方面的才能。总之对各种老教师都应该作适当安排，使他们发挥作用。
    全体老教师也应该知道，积极参加国家建设，贡献自己的知识和经验于灿烂的社会主义工业化的事业，是自己的光荣职责。而自己对国家贡献的大小，就要看自己是不是诚心诚意地、踏踏实实地学习马克思列宁主义、学习苏联的先进科学技术和教育经验、改造思想、进行创造性的教学和科学研究工作。老教师应该清楚地认识自己在思想上的严重缺点，自觉地进行长期的艰苦的思想改造，清除资产阶级的观点，努力争取成为一个马克思列宁主义的教师。
    高等学校所肩负的培养高级建设人才的任务是很艰巨的，目前教师的数量和质量都不敷需要。在这种情况下，我们必须充分挖掘潜力，而加强全体教师的团结，充分发挥他们的积极性，正是发挥学校潜力的重要方法之一。因此，应该重视老教师在国家建设中的作用，并加以充分发挥。但是，仅仅这样，还不能满足我国高等教育事业日益增长着的师资需要。因为原有教师的数量是很少的，而且他们所学的知识也有着一定的局限性。所以高等学校还必须积极地培养大批新的师资，才能够从根本上克服师资困难，并更好地推动老教师的思想改造。在这一工作中，高等学校中的党组织应该教育新教师虚心地向老教师学习，同时教育老教师认识自己负有培养新师资的责任，主动地帮助新教师，使新老教师互相取长补短，团结一致地办好高等学校，完成培养高级建设人才的光荣任务。
