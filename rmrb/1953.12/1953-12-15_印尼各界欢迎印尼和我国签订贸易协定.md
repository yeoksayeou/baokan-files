    After the news of the signing of the Sino-Indonesian trade agreement reached Indonesia, Indonesian parliamentarian H. Wotodjojo, representing the All-Indonesia Central Trade Union, said: This news will surely be welcomed by Indonesian workers and the majority of the people.

    Motik, the interim chairman of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce, said: The signing of the Sino-Indonesian trade agreement is a very reasonable action by the Indonesian government.

    【新华社十四日讯】雅加达消息：印度尼西亚官方和印尼报刊言论，继续对中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国贸易协定的签订表示欢迎。
    印尼政府外交部部长苏纳约五日在答复新闻记者的问题时表示：对于和中国建立贸易关系感到十分愉快。
    印尼报纸继续发表评论欢迎这一贸易协定的签订。十二月三日，“火炬日报”和“独立报”都兴高采烈地赞扬印尼政府和中国建立贸易关系，并指责美国所采取的损人利己的“禁运”政策。“泉源报”三日的社论并强调说：新中国是我们的近邻，应该和邻人合作，来繁荣社会，保障国与国之间的和平。
    【新华社广州十日电】雅加达消息：据印尼报刊报道：印尼各界热烈欢迎中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国贸易协定的签订。
    中印（尼）贸易协定签订的消息到达印尼后，代表印尼总工会的印尼国会议员禾多约说：这一消息必然获得印尼工人和大多数人民的欢迎。绝大多数人民是支持印尼政府这一步骤的；希望印尼政府不顾来自任何方面的压力，坚决执行这一政策。
