    Tangshan Huaxin Textile Factory's Second Spinning Shop Female Worker,
    Han Guihua, Creates National High Record for Spindle Watching
    Han Guihua, a female worker in the second spinning workshop of the jointly owned Tangshan Huaxin Textile Factory, flexibly applied the Hao Jianxiu work method and created a national record for watching 1,400 spindles, while maintaining a roller lapping rate below 0.49% (the quota is 0.6%), thus increasing output by 33.33% over the quota. This allows for an additional 108.8 pieces of raw yarn to be produced annually, increasing the nation's wealth by 770 million yuan. Due to the promotion of her operational skills and experience, the average number of spindles watched by workers in the entire workshop increased from 435 to 740, greatly increasing labor productivity.
    Han Guihua's operation of the machines is highly planned and proactive. Through her research, she found the recurring patterns of watching seven sides of the machines (200 spindles per side). She often adopts a double-sided patrol method, maintaining a patrol of each spindle every four minutes. She fixes the large spindles and small spindles as the patrol route, patrolling the large yarn once, and then turning around to patrol the small yarn once. This patrol pattern does not change unless there are particularly many breaks during doffing. In order to maintain a regular patrol, she must simultaneously solve the problem of changing roving and doing cleaning work. Under the conditions that the workshop has not yet adopted pagoda-style roving changes, she can accurately grasp the situation, know when to change each machine, and change the yarn ahead of time in the patrol in a flexible way; she also changes the yarn according to the situation of large, medium, and small yarns and the number of breaks, ensuring that there are no empty large tubes and that the patrol route is not disrupted. During the patrol, she also systematically alternates between cleaning and roving changes. When doing cleaning work, she does not start from one machine alone, but pays attention to each machine at the same time, not giving up any opportunity to do cleaning work; she also distinguishes between the primary and secondary cleaning work, placing the main ones—such as the twister surface and the licker-in roller—in the time when there are fewer roving changes, and only seizing the opportunity to do the secondary ones when there are more roving changes. Because she deeply grasped the spirit of the Hao Jianxiu work method and adopted this operation method, she can operate rhythmically when watching 1,400 spindles, neither increasing the roller lapping rate due to watching more spindles, nor ensuring the quality of the yarn.
    The second spinning workshop of the factory only started production in May of this year. The workers were unfamiliar with the new machines and the yarn count of the products. By June, the average number of spindles watched by workers in the entire workshop only reached 435, which generally did not meet the planned targets. Many workers were mentally unstable and requested to be transferred to other workshops. With the help of the workshop Party branch and the factory trade union, Han Guihua worked hard to study and become familiar with the machine conditions, considered improving the operation methods, and gradually increased the number of spindles watched—from 480, 600, to 800 spindles and 1,200 spindles, which inspired the confidence of the workshop workers to improve their spindle watching ability. After the factory launched a campaign to increase production and practice economy, Han Guihua further studied the combination of patrol routes and roving changes and cleaning work, and on September 10, while spinning 20.44 count yarn, created a record of watching 1,400 spindles (at that time, the workshop's end breakage rate was around 120 ends per 1,000 spindles, and the machine speed was 224 revolutions). For the past two months, she has maintained this record. Under her leadership, the average spindle watching ability of more than 90 workers in the entire workshop (about half of whom are new workers) has increased from 435 to 740, and 11 people can watch more than 1,000 spindles. After her advanced experience was promoted in the workshop, it has reduced the number of spinning workers by eight, saving about 9% of labor. (Wang Xi) (Attached picture)

    唐山华新纺织厂第二细纱间女工
    韩桂花创造了全国看锭最高纪录
    公私合营唐山华新纺织厂第二细纱车间女工韩桂花，灵活运用郝建秀工作法，创造了看一千四百纱锭的全国看锭最高纪录，并保持皮辊花率在百分之零点四九以下（定额是百分之零点六），从而使产量较定额提高了百分之三十三点三三，全年可多生产原纱一百零八点八件，为国家增产七亿七千万元的财富。由于她的操作技术经验的推广，使全车间工人平均看锭数目由四百三十五个提高到七百四十个，大大提高了劳动生产率。
    韩桂花看车操作，有着高度的计划性和主动精神。经过她的钻研，找到了看七面车（每面二百纱锭）的巡回规律。她经常是采取双面巡回的方法，保持每个纱锭相隔四分钟即巡回一次。她固定地以大纱锭和小纱锭为巡回路线，巡回一次大纱，转过来巡回一次小纱。这样的巡回规律除遇落纱断头特别多时，总不变更。为了保持有规律地巡回，她必须同时解决换粗纱和做清洁工作的方法问题。在车间尚未具备采取宝塔式换粗纱的条件下，她能确切地掌握情况，知道每挡车要在什么时候换，就在巡回中机动地提前换纱；她又根据大、中、小纱情况和断头情况换纱，保证不空大管又不打乱巡回路线。在巡回中，她又有计划地把做清洁工作和换粗纱工作交替进行。她做清洁工作，不单是从一部车开始，而是同时注意到每部车，不放弃任何做清洁工作的机会；她又分别清洁工作的主次，把主要的—如捻车面和掳毛辊，放在换粗纱少的时间做，遇到换粗纱多时只抓机会做次要的。由于她深刻掌握了郝建秀工作法的精神，采取了这样的操作方法，看一千四百锭时，进行有节奏的操作，既没有因多看纱锭而增加了皮辊花率，也保证了纱的质量。
    该厂第二细纱车间是今年五月才开工生产的。工人对新机器和产品支数都很生疏，到六月，全车间工人平均看锭数只达四百三十五个，普遍达不到计划指标，许多工人思想不安定，要求调换车间。在该厂车间党支部和厂工会的帮助下，韩桂花努力研究熟悉机器情况，考虑改进操作方法，逐步地增加了看锭数量—由四百八十、六百，提到了八百锭、一千二百锭，鼓舞了车间工人提高看锭能力的信心。在全厂开展增产节约竞赛后，韩桂花进一步钻研巡回路线及换粗纱、做清洁工作的结合关系，在九月十日纺二○点四四支纱，创造了看一千四百锭的纪录（当时车间断头率在一百二十根千锭时左右，机器转数二百二十四转。）两个月来，她始终保持了这个纪录。在她带动下，全车间九十多个工人（约有半数是新工人）平均看锭能力已由四百三十五个增加到七百四十个，已有十一人能看一千锭以上。她的先进经验，在车间推广后，已经减少了八个细纱工人，节省劳动力百分之九左右。       （汪溪）（附图片）
