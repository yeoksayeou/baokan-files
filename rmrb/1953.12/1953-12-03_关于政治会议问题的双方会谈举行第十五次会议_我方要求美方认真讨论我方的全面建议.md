Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 2nd. The delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China participating in the bilateral talks on the Political Conference question issued the following communique:

    On December 2nd, the fifteenth meeting of the bilateral talks on the Political Conference question was held.

    After a one-day recess, U.S. representative Dean, still using the excuse of not having enough time to obtain instructions from the other seventeen countries, avoided a serious discussion of the comprehensive proposal put forward by our side. Instead, he deliberately distorted our proposal in various ways in order to provoke disputes, with the aim of hindering the progress of the bilateral talks and thus delaying the convening of the Political Conference. In a speech lasting one and a half hours, the U.S. representative avoided mentioning the central issue of neutral nations participating in the Political Conference. He repeated the same old tune regarding the neutrality of the Soviet Union, attempting to deny it. Our representative, Mr. Huang Hua, immediately questioned him sternly: Why does the other side avoid mentioning the central issue of neutral nations participating in the Political Conference? The armistice agreement clearly defines neutral nations as countries whose combat troops have not participated in hostile actions in Korea. If the other side still recognizes the validity of the armistice agreement, how can it deny the neutral status of the Soviet Union? The U.S. representative still avoided answering. Our representative, Mr. Qi Shi-fu, then spoke out, pointing out that the Soviet Union fully complies with the definition of a neutral nation in Article 37 of the armistice agreement, and its neutral status cannot be denied. Since the other side has already agreed that the Political Conference should take the form of an equal bilateral conference rather than a round table conference, but unreasonably opposes the Soviet Union's participation as a neutral nation, then what status does the other side place the Soviet Union in? The other side attempts to impose various unreasonable restrictions on the participation of neutral nations in the Political Conference, so that neutral nations cannot play their due role in the Political Conference, which is essentially tantamount to rejecting the participation of neutral nations. The other side continues to adhere to this unreasonable proposition, obviously in order to prevent the bilateral talks from reaching an agreement quickly, thereby delaying the convening of the Political Conference. Mr. Qi Shi-fu finally pointed out: Our side has already put forward a fair and reasonable comprehensive proposal for the five agenda items. If the other side is still sincere in resolving the issue, it should conduct a serious discussion of our proposal and abandon its delaying and evasive tactics. For the sake of the rapid progress of the bilateral talks and the smooth convening of the Political Conference, our side solemnly advises the other side to reconsider its position.

    关于政治会议问题的双方会谈举行第十五次会议
    我方要求美方认真讨论我方的全面建议
    【新华社开城二日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国参加关于政治会议问题双方会谈的代表团发表公报如下：
    十二月二日，关于政治会议问题的双方会谈举行第十五次会议。
    美国代表迪安在休会一天之后，竟仍藉口来不及获得对方十七个国家的指示，避免对我方所提出的全面建议进行认真讨论，却故意对我方建议加以种种曲解，以便引起争论，以达到其阻挠双方会谈的进展从而拖延政治会议召开的目的。美国代表在长达一小时半的发言中，对中立国参加政治会议的中心问题竟避而不谈，对苏联的中立地位则老调重弹，企图加以否认。我方代表黄华先生当即严词质问：为什么对方对于中立国参加政治会议的中心问题避而不谈？停战协定对中立国的定义已明白规定为未有战斗部队参加在朝鲜的敌对行为的国家，如果对方还承认停战协定有效，如何能否认苏联的中立国地位？美方代表仍避不作答。我方代表奇石福先生继起发言指出：苏联完全符合于停战协定第三十七款中关于中立国的定义，其中立国的地位是无法否认的。对方既已同意政治会议采取双方对等会议的形式而不采取圆桌会议的形式，却又无理地反对苏联作为中立国参加，那么对方把苏联放在什么地位？对方对中立国的参加政治会议，企图加以种种无理的限制，使中立国不能在政治会议中发挥其应有的作用，实质上等于拒绝中立国参加。对方继续坚持这种无理主张，显然是为了使双方会谈不能迅速达成协议，从而拖延政治会议的召开。奇石福先生最后指出：我方已经对五项议程提出了一个公平合理的全面建议，对方如果还有诚意解决问题，就应对我方建议进行认真严肃的讨论，而放弃其拖延逃避的手段。为了双方会谈的迅速进展及政治会议的顺利召开，我方郑重劝告对方应重新考虑其立场。
