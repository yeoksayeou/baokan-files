    State Council of the Central People's Government
    Instructions on Improving and Developing Higher Normal Education
    (Passed at the 195th meeting of the State Council on November 26, 1953)
    Our country has entered a period of planned economic construction. According to the general line and general task of national construction during the transition period and the basic tasks of the first five-year plan, the basic task of our education cause is to vigorously cultivate construction talents and gradually improve the people's cultural level. Higher normal education is the key to running and developing secondary education well, and running and developing secondary education well is closely related to cultivating national construction talents and improving the people's cultural level. The quantity and quality of higher normal schools directly affect secondary education, the cultivation of the new Chinese youth generation, and indirectly affect the development and improvement of higher education, which also affects the state's plan to cultivate construction cadres and the completion of the state construction plan. In the past four years, China's higher normal schools have undergone rapid recovery and have greatly developed. There are now 31 higher normal schools, with more than double the number of students enrolled in the highest year in old China (1946). In the past four years, more than 20,000 students have graduated, supplying the needs of some teachers in secondary schools. At the same time, higher normal schools have carried out a series of tasks such as ideological transformation of teachers, adjustment of departments, and teaching reform, and have achieved certain results. However, today's higher normal schools, both in terms of quantity and quality, are still far from meeting the requirements of secondary schools. Therefore, developing and improving higher normal education to meet the needs of national construction is a very important task in the current education construction. For this reason, the following instructions are given:
    1. In the future, higher normal education work should adopt the policy of vigorously developing it in a planned and prepared manner based on consolidating existing higher normal education according to needs and possibilities. It should be affirmed that in order to meet the needs of national construction, higher normal education must be vigorously developed in the future, and at the same time, attention must be paid to consolidation and improvement of quality. In the next few years, the development of higher normal schools will mainly focus on expanding existing schools, followed by the establishment of new schools in a prepared manner. It is wrong to have a conservative ideology that disregards the needs of national construction, does not actively develop potential, and does not strive to create conditions and overcome difficulties to strive for development; it is also wrong to start solely from subjective wishes, disregard possible conditions, and blindly pursue quantity while neglecting quality and blindly advance.
    2. In order to achieve a balance between the supply and demand of teachers in secondary schools, in addition to continuing to run four-year undergraduate courses, two-year specialized courses, and two-year normal junior colleges in accordance with the current higher normal school system, it is also necessary to focus on adopting a variety of temporary transitional measures under the principle of ensuring a certain quality, such as undergraduate students graduating one year early, selecting some graduates of specialized courses to serve as senior secondary school teachers, and selecting junior middle school teachers and primary school teachers for short-term training to become senior and junior middle school teachers, etc. Each region should put forward specific plans based on its own needs and possibilities, and submit them to the Central Ministry of Education for approval before implementation.
    Comprehensive universities have the task of training some secondary school teachers. The specific methods shall be jointly studied and determined by the Higher Education Department, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Personnel, and submitted to the Central Cultural and Educational Committee for approval before implementation. Sports colleges and art colleges also have the task of training a certain number of secondary school sports, music, and art teachers, which shall be jointly studied and determined by the Physical Culture and Sports Commission, the Ministry of Culture, the Higher Education Department, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Personnel, and submitted to the Central Cultural and Educational Committee for approval before implementation. In addition, in the streamlining of institutions by central and local agencies and organizations, the Central Ministry of Personnel and personnel departments at all levels should be responsible for transferring a group of people with appropriate conditions to secondary schools to engage in teaching work. This is one of the current methods to supplement the shortage of teachers in secondary schools, and people's governments at all levels should attach importance to and do a good job in this work.
    3. The issue of teachers in higher normal schools themselves is the key to running and developing higher normal education well. All higher normal schools must conscientiously implement the policy of uniting and transforming intellectuals, and strengthen the leadership of teachers' political theory learning and professional learning, in order to improve the political and professional level of existing teachers. The phenomenon of disunity between new and old teachers in some schools must be vigorously corrected. New and old teachers should respect each other, learn from each other, learn from each other's strengths and make up for weaknesses, unite as one, in order to do a good job in education. In order to meet the needs of the future development of higher normal education, all higher normal schools with conditions should vigorously train new teachers in a planned manner. The Central Ministry of Education must formulate specific plans for training graduate students and teaching assistants according to the needs of the future development of higher normal schools, and hand them over to relevant higher normal schools for implementation, in order to solve the problem of teachers in higher normal schools. In addition, comprehensive universities, other institutions of higher learning, and scientific research institutions should also be responsible for training some teachers for higher normal schools. The specific methods shall be jointly studied and determined by the Higher Education Department, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Personnel, and submitted to the Central Cultural and Educational Committee for approval before implementation.
    4. In order to improve the quality of higher normal education, in addition to continuing to overcome the phenomenon of being busy and chaotic, establishing necessary work systems, and strengthening learning discipline, all higher normal schools should focus on the central link of teaching reform, and gradually reform the old teaching content, teaching organization, and teaching methods into new teaching content, teaching organization, and teaching methods with the Marxist standpoint, viewpoint, and method, in order to meet the requirements of national construction. When implementing teaching reform, we should conscientiously and systematically learn from the advanced educational theories and experience of the Soviet Union, and closely integrate them with China's reality, paying special attention to the reality of secondary schools and higher normal schools themselves. It is wrong to not conscientiously learn from the Soviet Union's experience, not understand the essence of Soviet educational theories and experience, and not conscientiously combine them with China's reality, but to formally and mechanically apply the Soviet Union's experience. The progress of teaching reform must be steady, and we must oppose both the impetuous mood of demanding too much and being too impatient, and the conservative ideology of being content with the status quo and delaying reform.
    Teaching reform should focus on the reform of teaching content, which is to first solve the problems of teaching plans, teaching outlines, and textbooks. The Central Ministry of Education must issue the Provisional Teaching Plan for Normal Colleges in the near future, and must revise the Provisional Teaching Plan for Normal Junior Colleges within the next year. Due to the different conditions of each higher normal school, the teaching plans of each school cannot be completely consistent at present. Each higher normal school should formulate its own teaching plan according to the specific conditions of each school based on the Provisional Teaching Plan promulgated by the Central Ministry of Education, and submit it to the Central Ministry of Education for review and approval. The Central Ministry of Education should be responsible for organizing teachers from various higher normal schools to compile teaching outlines and textbooks in a planned and step-by-step manner, and must complete the work of formulating teaching outlines and compiling textbooks and lecture notes for some major subjects within five years. At present, we should immediately organize the exchange of teaching materials to facilitate teaching. While improving teaching content, we should correspondingly reform teaching organization and teaching methods. The teaching research guidance group is the main organizational form for strengthening teaching work, and it is an important tool for exerting collective strength, improving teachers' level and teaching quality, and should be given sufficient attention and full use.
    5. In order to strengthen the leadership and management of higher normal schools and give play to the enthusiasm of local schools, higher normal schools should be led by the central government in a unified manner and directly managed by the local government in accordance with the principle of unified leadership and hierarchical management. The unified leadership of the Central Ministry of Education over higher normal schools across the country mainly involves managing their policies, plans, educational business guidance, and solving textbook problems. The way for local governments to implement direct management of higher normal schools can be decided by the major administrative regions based on local conditions, or managed uniformly by the major administrative region committees, or directly managed by the provincial (municipal) people's governments under the unified planning and supervision of the major administrative regions. The Central Ministry of Education should formulate the leadership relationship and division of responsibilities of education administrative departments at all levels for higher normal schools according to the above principles and taking into account the different situations in various regions, and submit it to the Central Cultural and Educational Committee for approval before implementation. Education administrative departments in major administrative regions and provinces and cities must set up a certain number of personnel to be responsible for the management of higher normal schools. In the future, all localities should actively run higher normal schools in their regions under the unified national plan, and gradually achieve self-sufficiency in teachers for secondary schools in each region. Due to the uneven development of higher normal education in various regions at present, the distribution of graduates from higher normal schools in the future should implement the principle of local distribution and central adjustment. The specific methods shall be formulated by the Ministry of Personnel in conjunction with the Ministry of Education.
    6. In order to run higher normal schools well, education administrative departments at all levels and higher normal schools should continue to deepen the struggle against bureaucracy, subjectivism, and decentralism, and earnestly improve leadership methods and work styles. The education departments of the people's governments above the provincial (municipal) level should strengthen the leadership, management, and inspection of the higher normal schools under their jurisdiction. The principals of all higher normal schools should, under the ideological guidance of Marxism-Leninism, strengthen the political and ideological leadership and professional leadership of the school's work in accordance with the general line and general task of national construction during the transition period and in accordance with the education policies of the people's government, and combine political leadership with professional leadership well, unite and give play to all forces within the school better, and work together to complete the school's education plan.

    中央人民政府政务院
    关于改进和发展高等师范教育的指示
    （一九五三年十一月二十六日政务院第一百九十五次政务会议通过）
    我们国家已经进入了有计划的经济建设时期。根据过渡时期国家建设的总路线总任务和第一个五年建设计划的基本任务，我们的教育事业的基本任务是大力培养建设人才和逐步提高人民文化水平。高等师范教育是办好和发展中等教育的关键，而办好和发展中等教育又与培养国家建设人才和提高人民文化水平有着密切的关系。高等师范学校的数量和质量直接影响中等教育，影响新中国青年一代的培养，间接影响高等教育的发展和提高，也就影响国家培养建设干部的计划和国家建设计划的完成。四年来我国高等师范学校，经过迅速恢复，有了很大的发展。现共有高等师范学校三十一所，在校学生超过旧中国历史上最高一年（一九四六年）的数字一倍以上，四年来共毕业了学生两万人以上，供应了中等学校部分师资的需要。同时高等师范学校进行了教师思想改造、院系调整、教学改革等一系列的工作，并取得了一定的成绩。但今天的高等师范学校，不论在数量上或质量上都还远不能适应中等学校的要求。因此，发展和提高高等师范教育以适应国家建设的需要，是当前教育建设中一个十分重要的任务。为此，特作如下指示：
    一、今后高等师范教育工作应该采取在整顿巩固现有高等师范教育的基础上，根据需要与可能，有计划、有准备地予以大力发展的方针。应该肯定：为了适应国家建设的需要，今后高等师范教育必须大力发展，同时也必须注意整顿巩固，提高质量。在今后若干年内高等师范学校的发展，主要是扩充现有学校，其次才是有准备地建立新校。不顾到国家建设的需要，不积极发挥潜力，不努力创造条件、克服困难、以力求发展的保守思想是不对的；单从主观愿望出发，不考虑可能条件，单纯追求数量而忽视质量，盲目冒进的做法也是不对的。
    二、为了求得中等学校师资供求的平衡，除按照现行高等师范学校学制，继续办理四年制本科、二年制专修科和二年制师范专科学校外，在保证一定质量的原则下，还必须着重采取多种临时过渡的办法，如本科生提前一年毕业，选拔一部分专修科毕业生充任高级中等学校教师，选调初中教师、小学教师予以短期训练培养成为高中和初中教师等等。各地区应根据本区的需要与可能，提出具体方案，送中央教育部批准后执行。
    综合大学有培养一部分中等学校师资的任务，其具体办法由高等教育部、教育部与人事部共同研究确定，送中央文委批准后执行。体育学院和艺术学院亦有培养一定数量的中等学校体育、音乐和美术师资的任务，由体育运动委员会、文化部、高等教育部、教育部与人事部共同研究确定，送中央文委批准后执行。此外，在中央与地方各机关、团体进行精简机构中，应由中央人事部和各级人事部门负责调配一批具有适当条件的人员，到中等学校担任教学工作。这是目前补充中等学校师资不足的办法之一，各级人民政府应重视和做好这项工作。
    三、高等师范学校本身的师资问题是办好和发展高等师范教育的关键。各高等师范学校须认真执行团结和改造知识分子的政策，并加强对教师政治理论学习与业务学习的领导，以提高现有教师的政治和业务水平。现在有些学校中存在着新老教师不团结的现象，必须大力予以纠正。新老教师应彼此尊重，互相学习，取长补短，团结一致，以便做好教育工作。为了适应今后高等师范教育的发展需要，凡有条件的高等师范学校，都应有计划地大力培养新师资。中央教育部须根据今后高等师范学校发展的需要，制订培养研究生和助教的具体计划，交有关高等师范学校执行，以解决高等师范学校的师资问题。此外，综合大学、其他高等学校及科学研究机关亦应负责培养高等师范学校的一部分师资，其具体办法由高等教育部、中国科学院、教育部与人事部共同研究确定，送中央文委批准后执行。
    四、为了提高高等师范教育的质量，各高等师范学校除应继续克服忙乱现象，建立必要的工作制度，加强学习纪律外，尤应抓紧教学改革这一中心环节，以马克思主义的立场、观点和方法，逐步地将旧的教学内容、教学组织和教学方法改革为新的教学内容、教学组织和教学方法，以适应国家建设的要求。在实行教学改革时应认真地系统地学习苏联的先进教育理论和经验，并密切结合中国的实际，特别注意联系中等学校和高等师范学校本身的实际。不认真学习苏联经验，不体会苏联教育理论与经验的实质，不认真结合中国的实际，而只是形式地机械地搬用苏联经验是不对的。教学改革的进行，必须稳步前进，既要反对要求过高过急的急躁情绪，又要反对安于现状、拖延不改的保守思想。
    教学改革应着重教学内容的改革，就是首先解决教学计划、教学大纲和教科书的问题。中央教育部须于最近期间颁布师范学院的暂行教学计划，并须于明年内修订师范专科学校的暂行教学计划。由于各高等师范学校条件不同，各校教学计划目前还不可能完全一致，各高等师范学校应根据中央教育部颁布的暂行教学计划，按照各校具体条件，制订本校的教学计划，送中央教育部审核批准。中央教育部应负责组织各高等师范学校教师有计划有步骤地编订教学大纲和教科书，并须在五年内，完成制订教学大纲的工作，和编译部分主要科目的课本和讲义。现时应即组织交流教材的工作，以利教学的进行。在改进教学内容的同时，应相应地改革教学组织和教学方法。教学研究指导组是加强教学工作的主要组织形式，是发挥集体力量，提高教师水平和教学质量的重要工具，应予以足够的重视和充分的运用。
    五、为了加强对高等师范学校的领导与管理，并发挥地方办学的积极性，高等师范学校应根据统一领导、分层管理的原则，由中央统一领导，地方直接管理。中央教育部对全国高等师范学校的统一领导，主要是掌管其方针、政策、计划、教育业务指导和解决教材问题。地方对高等师范学校实行直接管理的方式可由大区根据当地情况决定，或由大区行政委员会统一管理，或在大区统一计划与督导下，由省（市）人民政府直接管理。中央教育部应根据上述原则并照顾各地区不同情况，规定各级教育行政部门对高等师范学校的领导关系及分工职掌，送中央文委批准后执行。大区和省市教育行政部门必须设置一定人员负责管理高等师范学校。今后各地应在国家统一计划下，积极办好本地区的高等师范学校，逐步做到中等学校师资由各地区自给自足。由于目前各地区高等师范教育发展不平衡，在今后一定时期内高等师范学校毕业生的分配应实行由地方分配、中央调剂的原则。其具体办法由人事部会同教育部规定之。
    六、为了办好高等师范学校，各级教育行政部门和高等师范学校应继续深入反对官僚主义、主观主义和分散主义的斗争，切实改进领导方法和作风。省（市）以上人民政府教育部门应加强对其所属高等师范学校的领导、管理与检查。各高等师范学校校长应在马克思列宁主义的思想指导下，根据过渡时期国家建设的总路线和总任务，遵照人民政府的教育方针政策，加强对学校工作的政治思想领导与业务领导，并把政治领导与业务领导很好地结合起来，更好地团结并发挥校内一切力量，共同为完成学校的教育计划而努力。
                         总理周恩来
                    一九五三年十二月十一日
