Xinhua News Agency, December 19th—The North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a working conference for state-owned farms in the entire North China region from November 26th to December 8th to implement the Party's general line during the transition period and consolidate and develop the socialist agriculture's farm work. The conference summarized the work of the farms in the past and determined the future guidelines and tasks.

In recent years, the state-owned farms in North China have produced a considerable amount of commercial grain and cotton for the country; played a certain demonstration role among the broad masses of peasants; trained a large number of cadres; and gained preliminary experience in running farms. There are currently ten mechanized farms in the region. The total output value of these farms this year reached 39.8 billion yuan, with a net profit of 2.7 billion yuan. The yields of major crops in each farm have increased by 50% to 140% compared to 1950, with some individual farms increasing tenfold. The yield per unit area of general farms is more than 50% higher than the average yield per unit area of local farmers. In addition, there are 315 agricultural experiment stations in the region. In recent years, each agricultural experiment station has improved, cultivated, and promoted a considerable number of improved varieties, and has also conducted some experiments and teaching work on cultivation, planting, crop field management, and other technologies. They have made great achievements in summarizing and promoting the experience of the masses in increasing production and strengthening the production technology guidance for farmers. The total output value of agricultural experiment stations in the region this year is roughly the same as that of mechanized farms, and the yield per unit area is generally 60% higher than the yield of local farmers. Although the farms in North China have made many achievements in various aspects, some farms still have great blindness in operation and management, resulting in high costs, large waste, low returns, and losses year after year.

Based on the situation of farms throughout the region, the conference stipulated that the working guidelines for state-owned farms in 1954 are to consolidate existing farms, tractor stations, and animal-drawn implement stations, and to develop new farms and new tractor stations and animal-drawn implement stations in a planned and step-by-step manner. Regarding the tasks of state-owned mechanized farms, the conference stipulated that they should produce a large amount of commercial grain and cotton for the country, and demonstrate to farmers the superiority of machine production in order to promote the transformation of the small-scale peasant economy. Farms in urban suburbs should supply the state and urban people with vegetables, fruits, meats, oils, dairy products, and other necessities, with a current focus on supplying vegetables. Agricultural experiment stations should take a step forward on the original basis, carry out fewer but more refined experimental research work, and become a base for cultivating and promoting improved varieties, a core for technological reform, a banner for demonstrating increased production in a certain area, and a school for training primary agricultural technicians. The conference attached great importance to the development of agricultural experiment stations, requiring each experiment station to earnestly implement on-site experiments and off-site promotion, and strive to make the varieties of several major crops in the local area into preliminary selected improved varieties within a few years, and should vigorously improve cultivation techniques and strengthen the prevention and control of pests and diseases.

The conference pointed out that to further improve farm work, it is necessary to strengthen the operation and management of farms, implement the economic accounting system, conduct inventory and asset verification, rectify institutions, set reasonable quotas, establish a technical responsibility system, and strengthen the Party's specific leadership over farms at all levels; in addition, we should strengthen the socialist and patriotic education of all employees, continuously improve their political consciousness, and give full play to their enthusiasm and creativity.

    华北确定明年国营农场工作方针
     【新华社十九日讯】中共中央华北局为贯彻党在过渡时期的总路线，巩固和发展社会主义农业的农场工作，于十一月二十六日至十二月八日召开了华北全区的国营农场工作会议。会议总结了过去农场的工作，确定了今后的方针任务。
    华北各国营农场，几年来为国家出产了相当数量的商品粮食和棉花；在广大农民群众中起了一定程度的示范作用；培养了大批干部，取得了办农场的初步经验。全区现有十个机耕农场，这些农场今年的总产值达三百九十八亿元，纯盈利二十七亿元，各农场主要作物产量都比一九五零年增加百分之五十到一百四十，个别农场有增加到十倍的；一般农场的单位面积产量比当地农民的平均单位面积产量高出百分之五十以上。另外，全区有三百一十五个农事试验场。几年来，各农事试验场都改良、培育和推广了相当数量的优良品种，对耕作、栽培、作物田间管理等技术也都作了一些试验与传授工作，在总结和推广群众增产经验，加强对农民的生产技术指导方面有很大成绩。全区农事试验场今年的生产总值大体与机械农场相等，单位面积产量一般比当地农民的产量高百分之六十。华北各地农场虽然在各方面有不少成绩，但有若干农场在经营管理上还存在着很大的盲目性，以致有成本高，浪费大，收益少，连年赔钱的情况。
    根据全区农场情况，会议规定一九五四年国营农场的工作方针是：整顿巩固现有的农场、拖拉机站和马拉农具站，有计划有步骤地发展新的农场和新的拖拉机站、马拉农具站。关于国营机耕农场的任务，会议规定是为国家生产大量的商品粮食和棉花，并运用机器生产的优越性，向农民示范，以促进小农经济的改造。城市郊区的农场，应供给国家及城市人民生活需要的蔬菜、果品、肉类、油脂、乳食等，目前尤应以供应蔬菜为主。农事试验场要在原有基础上提高一步，进行少而精的试验研究工作，在一定地区内成为培育和推广良种的基地，技术改革的核心，增产示范的旗帜，并成为培养农业初级技术干部的学校。会议十分重视农事试验场的工作开展，要求各试验场切实贯彻场内试验、场外推广，争取在几年内使本地的几种主要作物的品种成为初选的优良品种，并应大力改良耕作技术及加强防除病虫害工作。
    会议指出：进一步改善农场工作，必须加强农场的经营管理，贯彻经济核算制，实行清产核资，整顿机构，合理定额，建立技术责任制和加强党对各级农场的具体领导等一系列的工作；另外，应加强对全体职工的社会主义和爱国主义教育，不断提高他们的政治觉悟，发挥他们的积极性和创造性等。
