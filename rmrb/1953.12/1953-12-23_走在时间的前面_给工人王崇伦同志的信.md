    Walking Ahead of Time
    -- A Letter to Comrade Worker Wang Chonglun
    Wei Wei
    Dear young artisan Comrade Wang Chonglun:
    I admire you, I adore you.
    It is now December of 1953, a time when people are working hard to complete this year's work plans. But your lathe has already enthusiastically and passionately crossed into 1956 with a loud and exciting rhythm. Yes, I am not wrong at all, it is precisely 1956, the fourth year of the motherland's first Five-Year Plan! Dear comrade, when I heard this news from the broadcast on the street, I stood under the large loudspeaker hanging on the utility pole for a long, long time. At that moment, I felt a burning, flaming, sincere heart, the heart of the working class, rushing over my head with a sound! I pondered. Who can hear this news without causing their own deep thought, who can not associate it with himself, his own work? Dear comrade, you are like a signal flare announcing the start of a major offensive campaign, rushing into the sky with fascinating colors. How will it attract thousands of people loyal to the motherland, sparing no effort to catch up and rush forward!
    How much I wanted to write you a letter. I must express my gratitude to you as a Chinese. But you will know that my respect and gratitude for you will not only represent myself. I have been to Korea and some islands on our motherland's defense line. I once said that the soldiers of the Volunteer Army cherish the pictures of the motherland's construction that they stick in the trenches or carry in their arms. Even when some soldiers sacrificed, these pictures were stained with blood along with their mother's photos. The soldiers on the defense line, although we mention them less, are also very arduous! They are far away from their hometowns, their wives and children, living on overseas isolated islands, where there is no absence of gunfire, no absence of complex and difficult battles. They still cannot take off their clothes to sleep, and to get a sip of water, they have to climb mountains and cross ridges to carry it from several or even ten miles away. It is very difficult to see a movie once. What is their greatest comfort? It is the little boat swaying in the wind and waves that brings a little bit of news about the motherland's construction. Therefore, Comrade Wang Chonglun, I think you deeply understand their feelings. When our soldiers can hear that our motherland has such excellent workers like you, so courageous and intelligent, and such outstanding labor on the industrial front, how much joy and encouragement will they receive, how much will they thank you from the bottom of their hearts!
    When I talked about you with my fellow workers around me, everyone exclaimed:
    "Hey, look at others! If everyone were like him, our socialist insurance could come early!"
    Yes, Comrade Wang Chonglun, if everyone had such a high spirit of creation as you, our socialism would be realized earlier. Our transition to socialism will not be as accurate as our clock hands pointing to twelve o'clock and the cafeteria opening for lunch. History has not pointed to a page in many calendars and said, "Let's hold a celebration meeting, young people, this day is socialism!" Things will not be like this. The realization of socialism can be earlier or later. Because socialism is not hidden in some mysterious place, it lives in our hands. If each of us is very conscious and uses all the strength of his life to create, then she will come earlier; and if there are still many people among us who want others to "take" them to socialism, many people who want to "drift" to socialism along with the crowd, many selfish people, and many people who are afraid to walk ahead of time, then this beautiful time will come later. Let me quote an old worker here, he said: "As long as we do well, socialism will come early." How correct and straightforward this is! And you, Comrade Wang Chonglun, you are one who does well! You have broken free from the annoying time that often teases us, and bravely and brilliantly walked ahead of time. In our army, there are such people who, as soon as the bugle sounds, no matter how fierce the enemy's artillery fire, he has already rushed to the forefront. This kind of person is often a hundredfold encourager of courage for the entire front line, and this kind of person is the most excellent and lovely soldier in our army. And you, Comrade Wang Chonglun, you are like these soldiers, rushing far ahead. I want to put you and these most excellent soldiers together in my heart. Let us catch up with you, let us walk ahead of time with you in the sound of the general line's bugle!
    Comrade Wang Chonglun, from your experience in creating the "universal tool fixture," I realize that we must promote the creative courage and confidence of our working class even more. Before you created this tool, didn't you have such thoughts: "With my limited skills, how can I create tools out of thin air..." Other workers often have similar ideas: "Creating tools, this is the business of engineers and technicians, can we do it?" This lack of creative courage and confidence is the result of our working class being in a long-term oppressed and despised position in the old society. It should be said that in our country, the era of "ordinary people" creating "miracles" has arrived. The rich creativity of our people can create any "miracle." Comrade Gao YuBao, who is not very literate, can write such good books, isn't this a miracle? Liu Guangzi, holding a rifle, can capture sixty-three enemies at once, isn't this a miracle? Steel fighter Zhang Weiliang, after being seriously injured, crawled for ten days and nine nights and finally crawled back to his own position, isn't this a miracle? Our Jingjiang flood diversion project, which would take many years to complete in capitalist countries, was completed in more than two months by us, aren't these all miracles? On our industrial front, there are no shortage of these miracles either. Seriously speaking, the victory of our War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea is itself a miracle. Our country, in a very short period of time, has achieved amazing achievements, which is the biggest miracle. However, these miracles are all made by us ordinary people. Our worker comrades should muster the courage to create, and on our current industrial front, make the entire working class form a creative torrent full of heroic spirit!
    For three years, the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, which determined the fate of our motherland's people, was extremely arduous and fierce. The glorious Chinese People's Volunteer Army stood at the forefront of this front. Today, as our motherland enters a historical period of great construction, who is standing at the forefront of this grand front that determines the foundation of our motherland for all ages? It is none other than our great working class. It should be said that our Volunteer Army has not failed the heavy trust of the people of the whole country, and they have done a good job in completing the tasks they have shouldered. Today, our great working class will definitely take the Volunteer Army as an example, and will be as heroic as the Volunteer Army, leaving immortal achievements in the history of socialist industrialization for our nation and our people. And you, Comrade Wang Chonglun, on this tense front, I hope to continue to hear your new achievements. Let you and all worker comrades create happiness for our descendants for all generations.
    I wish you and the technical personnel comrades who help you in creative activities good health.
    Finally, I will copy a small poem that I wrote casually at the end as a small gift to you.
    Old Man Time, do you say he's old or not?
    Wearing a pair of reading glasses, his beard and eyebrows are all white.
    But he rides a wind-chasing horse,
    Carrying a large bag of calendars, running ahead of us year after year.
    Chase! Chase!
    So tired that people's backs ache and their legs are sore, they stare with wide eyes and can't catch up.
    Didn't you hear people shouting: "Too much work, too little time."
    But, one young man's legs are truly rare,
    Now it's 1953, and he's starting his work for 1956.
    The old man got anxious when he saw it, his beard cocked up so high,
    He beat the wind-chasing horse with his crutch, making it snort white saliva,
    He didn't catch up with the young man, and he didn't know when he lost his reading glasses.
    Angered, he threw down his calendar bag and sighed:
    "Hey! You're all clumsy, not listening to my arrangements,
    Socialism is up to you to bring forward!"
                              December 2nd

### 走在时间的前面——给工人王崇伦同志的信

    走在时间的前面
    ——给工人王崇伦同志的信
    魏巍亲爱的年轻的工匠王崇伦同志：
    我钦佩您，敬慕您。
    现在是一九五三年的十二月，正是人们为完成今年的工作计划而紧张奋斗的时候，而您的车床已经热情奔放地带着响亮激越的音节跨进了一九五六年。是呀，我一点都没有说错，正是祖国第一个五年计划第四年的那个一九五六年！亲爱的同志，当我从街头的广播里，听到了您的这个消息，我在那个电线杆挂着的大喇叭下，站了很久，很久。我当时觉得，在我的头顶上，冲过一颗带着响声的、燃着火焰的、赤诚的忠心，工人阶级的忠心！我沉思了。谁听了这个消息，能不引起自己的深思呢，谁能够不联想到他自己，他自己的工作？亲爱的同志，您就像一颗宣布大进攻战役开始的信号弹一样，带着迷人的色彩冲上了天空，它将怎样地吸引着万千忠于祖国的人们，不惜一切地赶上前去，扑上前去呵。
    我多么想给您写一封信。我必须表示作为一个中国人对您的感激。但您会知道，我对您的尊敬和感激，不会只是代表我一个人的。我到过朝鲜，也到过我们祖国海防线上的一些岛屿。我曾经说过，志愿军的战士们，他们把祖国建设的画片是如何珍爱地贴在战壕里，或者揣在自己的怀里，甚至当有的战士牺牲时，这些画片，是跟他母亲的照片一起被鲜血染湿的。国防线上的战士们，虽然我们对他们提得少些，但他们也是多么艰苦啊！他们远远离开自己的家乡，自己的妻子老小，住在海外的孤岛上，那儿不是没有枪声的，那儿不是没有复杂而艰苦的战斗，那儿还是不能脱衣服睡觉，吃一口水，也要爬山过岭到几里、十几里以外的地方去抬，看一次电影那就很不容易。什么是他们最大的安慰？那就是靠风浪里摇来的一只小船，带来一点两点祖国建设的消息。因此，王崇伦同志，我认为您是深切地懂得他们心情的人。当我们的战士们，能够听到我们的祖国有像您这样优秀的工人，这么有勇气，有智慧，在工业战线上这么出色的劳动，他们会得到多大的快乐与鼓舞呵，他们会怎样地从心眼里感激您呵！
    当我和我周围的工人同志们谈起您的时候，大家都赞叹地说：
    “嘿，看看人家！要是大家都像他那样，咱们的社会主义保险能提早来到！”
    是的，王崇伦同志，如果大家都像您那样高的创造精神，我们的社会主义是会提早实现的。我们过渡到社会主义的日子，并不会像我们的表针一指到十二点食堂里就开午饭那样的准确。历史老人也并不曾给我们指着许多日历中的一页说：“开庆祝大会吧，小伙子们，这一天是社会主义！”事情是不会这样的。社会主义的实现，是可以早些，也可以晚些的。因为社会主义并没有被藏到什么神秘的地方，他就住在我们的手上。如果我们每个人都很自觉，都用他全部生命的力量来创造，那么她就会来得早些；而如果我们中间，想让别人把自己“带”到社会主义去的人还很多，想随大流“流”到社会主义去的人还很多，自私自利的人还很多，害怕走到时间前面去的人还很多，那么，这个美丽的时间，是会到来得晚些的。让我在这里引用一个老工人的话吧，他说：“只要咱们干得好，社会主义就来得早。”这话说得多正确，多干脆！而您，王崇伦同志，您就是干得好的一个！您摆脱了时常捉弄我们的恼人的时间，勇敢地出色地走到了时间的前面。我们部队中，有这么一种人，只要冲锋号一响，不管敌人的炮火多么激烈，他早已冲到了最前面，这种人常常是全部战线勇气百倍的鼓舞者，这种人是我们部队中最优秀最可爱的战士。而您，王崇伦同志，您就像这些战士一样，远远地冲到前面去了。我要在我的心里，把您和这些最优秀的战士们排在一起。让我们追上您，让我们跟您一起，在总路线的号角声中走到时间的前面去吧！
    王崇伦同志，从您创造“万能工具胎”的经验里，我体会到，必须把我们工人阶级的创造勇气和信心更高地发扬起来。您在创造这个工具之前，不是有过这样的想法吗：“就凭我这两下子，怎么能凭空创造工具呢……”别的工友们，也常有类似的想法：“创造工具，这都是工程师、技术人员的事，咱们能行吗？”这种创造勇气和信心不足的心理，是我们工人阶级在旧社会里长期处在被压迫、被轻视地位的结果。应该说，在我们的国家里，“平凡人”创造“奇迹”的年代已经到来了。我们人民丰富的创造力，可以创造出任何的“奇迹”。识字不很多的高玉宝同志，能够写出那样好的书来，这不是奇迹吗？拿着一枝步枪的刘光子，一下子能捉到六十三个敌人，这不是奇迹吗？钢铁战士张渭良，在负了重伤之后，爬了十天九夜终于爬回自己的阵地，这不是奇迹吗？我们荆江分洪的工程，在资本主义国家里好多年才可以完成，而我们两个多月就完成了，这不都是奇迹吗？在我们的工业战线上，这些奇迹同样不少。认真地说，我们抗美援朝战争的胜利，本身就是一个奇迹，我们的国家，在很短的时间里，取得了惊人的成就，就是一个最大的奇迹。然而，这些奇迹，都是我们这些平凡的人们做出来的。我们的工人同志们，应该鼓起创造的勇气，在我们当前的工业战线上，使整个的工人阶级，形成一个充满英雄气慨的创造的洪流！
    三年来，决定我们祖国人民命运的抗美援朝战争，是极端艰苦、激烈的，光荣的中国人民志愿军站在这条战线的最前列。今天，当我们的祖国进入大建设的历史时期，这条决定我们祖国万世基业的宏大战线，是谁站在它的最前列呢？不是别人，正是我们伟大的工人阶级。应该说，我们的志愿军，没有辜负全国人民的重托，他们对他们所担负的任务，是完成得不坏的。今天，我们伟大的工人阶级，一定会拿志愿军做榜样，一定会像志愿军那样的英勇，在社会主义工业化的历史上，给我们的民族，给我们的人民留下万世不朽的功勋。而您，王崇伦同志，在这条紧张的战线上，我希望继续不断地听到您的新的战绩。让您和所有工人同志为我们的子孙万代创造幸福吧。
    祝您，和帮助您进行创造活动的技术人员同志们健康。
    最后，我把我随手写的一首小诗抄在后面，算是对您的一件小小的贺礼。
    时光老人，你说他老不老？
    戴着一副老花镜，胡子眉毛全白了。
    可是他乘着一匹追风马，
    提着一大包日历，年年月月在我们前面跑。
    追呀！追呀！
    累得人腰疼腿酸，干瞪两眼追不上，
    你没听见人们嚷：“工作太多时间少。”
    可是，有一个小伙子的腿脚真少见，
    现在是一九五三年，他一九五六年的工作开始了。
    老人一看着了急，胡子一翘多么高，
    用拐杖打得追风马喷着白涶，
    没追上小伙子，老花镜也不知什么时候丢掉了。
    气得他日历包一丢，一声长叹：
    “咳！你们毛手毛脚，什么也不听我安排，
    社会主义由你们自己去提早！”
                              十二月二日
