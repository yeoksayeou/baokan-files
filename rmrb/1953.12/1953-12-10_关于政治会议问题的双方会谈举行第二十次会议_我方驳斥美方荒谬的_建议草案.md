Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 9th: The delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China participating in the bilateral talks on the issue of a political conference issued the following communique: On December 9th, the 20th meeting of the bilateral talks on the issue of a political conference was held.

    Our representative, Mr. Qi Xiufu, made a further analysis of the so-called "draft proposal" put forward by the other side yesterday, exposing the absurdity and deceptiveness of the other side's draft proposal. Mr. Qi Xiufu pointed out: The other side stubbornly denies the absurd assertion that the Soviet Union is a neutral country, insists on imposing various unreasonable restrictions on the participation of neutral countries in the political conference, refuses to determine the neutral countries participating in the political conference, opposes determining the agenda of the political conference in the bilateral talks, insists on a voting procedure that monopolizes the voting rights of the countries participating on its side, and even fundamentally denies the nature of the political conference as a bilateral and equal meeting, absurdly asserting that the United Nations should serve as the secretariat of the political conference, and that the Secretary-General of the United Nations should send personnel to discuss the rules of procedure and administrative arrangements of the political conference with both sides. The bilateral talks have lasted for forty-three days, and the other side has not moved forward. Up to now, the only thing the other side can affirm is to hold a political conference in Geneva on a day that is far into the indefinite future, which the other side had proposed long ago and which our side had opposed long ago. The other side's so-called proposal is merely a sum total of the other side's unreasonable demands. The other side's purpose is only to delay the bilateral talks in order to sabotage the Korean armistice, forcibly detain prisoners of war, refuse a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and maintain and create a tense situation. Our side resolutely rejects the other side's so-called draft proposal. For the sake of peace, our side requests the other side to seriously consider and accept our comprehensive proposal of November 30th.

    After the U.S. representative Dean's absurd and deceptive proposal was thoroughly exposed by our side, he became enraged and hurled rampant slander and defamation against the Soviet Union and the Korean-Chinese side, and made a brutal threat to our side to terminate the talks. Our representative, Mr. Huang Hua, immediately refuted this and pointed out: The other side's use of slander and abuse to replace the language of the meeting is sufficient to prove that the other side is conspiring to completely destroy the bilateral talks by this provocative method. If the other side is determined not to continue the current talks, it should make a clear statement and bear all the responsibility for destroying the bilateral talks.

    The full text of Mr. Qi Xiufu's speech is as follows:

    We have carefully studied your "draft proposal" presented on December 8th, and I cannot but point out once again: Your so-called "draft proposal" is not only a sum total of your various unreasonable demands, but also, on many important issues, even more retrogressive than what you have expressed at this meeting in the past. You stubbornly maintain the absurd assertion that the Soviet Union is not a neutral country, you insist on various unreasonable restrictions on the participation of neutral countries in the political conference, and you refuse to determine the neutral countries participating in the political conference at this meeting. You oppose determining the agenda of the political conference at this meeting. You insist on a voting procedure that monopolizes the voting rights of the countries participating on your side. You even disregard the principle that the political conference is a bilateral and equal meeting, absurdly asserting that the rules of procedure and administrative arrangements of the political conference should be discussed and agreed upon by the representatives of both sides and the personnel sent by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, whom you claim to represent. What exactly have you definitely agreed to? Holding a political conference in Geneva on a day that is far into the indefinite future, which you had proposed long ago. What about the neutral countries? What about the agenda of the political conference? We'll talk about that later. Mr. Dean: Isn't this the old trick of dividing the political conference into so-called two stages, which you have consistently advocated and which our side has consistently opposed? The bilateral talks have been going on for forty-three days, and you are still standing in the same place without moving. Isn't this your planned procrastination? You put forward such an absurd and unreasonable plan and even say outside the meeting that this is your "final proposal" and want us to accept it. Do you think we can accept it? That's not going to happen. We solemnly declare once again: We resolutely reject this plan.

    On the issue of the Soviet Union participating in the political conference as a neutral country, your side has not changed your absurd and unreasonable stance in the slightest. You still disregard the facts and unreasonably deny that the Soviet Union is a neutral country, and insist that the Soviet Union participate in the political conference as a country on one side of the belligerents. Is this your "sincere effort" to promote the early convening of the political conference? Please don't be ridiculous! If your side does not understand our side's position on this issue, then let me tell you again: The neutrality of the Soviet Union is a fact, it is the truth, and therefore it is undeniable and indisputable. The Soviet Union must participate in the political conference as a neutral country.

    In your statement on December 7th, you have already admitted that neutral countries participating in the political conference "should not be hindered by unworkable and impractical meeting procedures and unnecessary restrictive rules," but your so-called "draft proposal" is precisely designed to make it impossible for neutral countries to play their role in the political conference by means of unworkable and impractical meeting procedures and unnecessary restrictive rules. In your so-called "draft proposal," you not only did not abandon the various unreasonable restrictions that you had previously proposed on the powers of neutral countries in the political conference, but also added a new layer of restrictions, even depriving neutral countries of the right to make proposals. Your proposal turns the participation of neutral countries in the political conference into a farce, and no neutral country with self-respect will participate.

    Our side has already specifically suggested inviting five neutral countries, the Soviet Union, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Burma, to participate in the political conference, but your side has consistently refused the five neutral countries nominated by our side, but has not been able to provide any tenable reasons. You agree to resolve the issue of neutral countries participating in the political conference in the current bilateral talks, and you have at least superficially agreed that it is necessary to invite neutral countries to participate in the political conference, but your so-called "draft proposal" is to refuse to determine the neutral countries participating in the political conference, actually shelving the issue of inviting neutral countries to participate in the political conference without resolving it. This is not only a step backward, but simply a hoax.

    In your statement on December 7th, you have already admitted that the agenda items for the political conference suggested by our side are "in accordance with the scope of authority of the armistice agreement and prisoners of war" and "must be dealt with in the political conference," but in your so-called "draft proposal," you oppose determining the agenda of the political conference in the current bilateral talks. Since the agenda of the political conference suggested by our side is completely in accordance with the relevant provisions of the armistice agreement, you have no reason to oppose it, and even less reason to oppose determining the agenda of the political conference in the bilateral talks. Your proposal puts forward many unreasonable but specific opinions on the issue of some administrative affairs, but delays the resolution of central issues such as the participation of neutral countries in the political conference and the agenda of the political conference. What ulterior motives are you harboring in doing so?

    Regarding the voting procedure of the political conference, although your so-called new proposal no longer mentions the name of unit voting, in fact you still insist on a voting procedure that monopolizes the voting rights of the countries participating on your side. If your side is not reserving a way for some of your member countries to undermine the agreement, what reason do you have to insist on this voting procedure, which is superficially called simplification, but in reality does not solve the problem?

    In your statement on December 7th, you said: "As for your suggestions regarding the way of drafting the rules of procedure and regarding administrative matters, our opinions are roughly similar," and also said: "These matters can be suggested to the political conference by the representatives of both sides and the representatives of the host government after consultation before the political conference is convened." But one day later, in your so-called "draft proposal," you absurdly suggested that the Secretary-General of the United Nations should provide the political conference with a joint secretariat and simultaneous interpretation equipment. What is particularly absurd is that you suggested that the representatives of both sides and the representative appointed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations should jointly discuss the rules of procedure and other related administrative and procedural matters of the political conference. How is this similar to the reasonable proposal put forward by our side based on the principle of bilateral and equal meetings? Our side has already pointed out yesterday that your side seems to have forgotten that there are no representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China in the United Nations agencies. Your side claims to be the side representing the United Nations, and it is precisely this organization that, under the control of the United States, recently slandered and defamed the Korean-Chinese side. Our side really cannot imagine how your side can put forward such an absurd and ridiculous proposal. Our side does not underestimate your wisdom, but your side's presentation of this proposal can only lead our side to the conclusion that your side intends to create disputes so that the two sides cannot reach an agreement quickly.

    In order to promote the rapid conclusion of an agreement between the two sides, our side has abandoned the location previously suggested for the convening of the political conference, and has proposed New Delhi, India, which your side cannot oppose, but your side has found new but untenable excuses to oppose it. Not only that, but your side has even retreated to Geneva, which your side previously suggested. No matter how you quibble, you cannot call this regressive approach of your side a "sincere proposal."

    It is obvious that your so-called "draft proposal" is not put forward in order to solve the problem, but in order to further obstruct the convening of the political conference. Precisely because of this, your side opposes our side's proposal to convene the political conference on December 28th. In your so-called "draft proposal," you not only insist on old unreasonable demands, but also add new absurd demands, making it more difficult for the two sides to reach an agreement, thereby indefinitely delaying the convening of the political conference. This would facilitate your side in achieving evil conspiracies such as forcibly detaining our captured personnel, obstructing the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and maintaining a tense world situation. This evil conspiracy cannot be concealed by any deceptive means on your side. The peace-loving people of the whole world will never allow your side to realize this evil conspiracy. If your side does not want to suffer a new shameful defeat under the blows of the people of the world, your side should honestly strive for an agreement on the basis of our comprehensive proposal in order to quickly convene the political conference.

    关于政治会议问题的双方会谈举行第二十次会议
    我方驳斥美方荒谬的“建议草案”
    【新华社开城九日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国参加关于政治会议问题双方会谈的代表团发表公报如下：十二月九日，关于政治会议问题的双方会谈举行第二十次会议。
    我方代表奇石福先生对于对方昨日提出的所谓“建议草案”作了进一步的分析，揭露对方建议草案的荒谬与欺骗性。奇石福先生指出：对方坚持否认苏联为中立国的荒谬主张，坚持对中立国的参加政治会议加以种种无理限制，并拒绝确定参加政治会议的中立国，反对在双方会谈中确定政治会议的议程，坚持垄断本方参加国家表决权利的表决程序，甚至根本否认政治会议是双方对等会议的性质，荒谬地主张由联合国担任政治会议的秘书机构，并由联合国秘书长派人与双方商定政治会议的议事规则与行政安排。双方会谈四十三天，对方未前进一步。谈到现在，对方所能肯定的只是在遥遥无期的日子，在对方早已提出而为我方所早已反对的日内瓦召开政治会议。对方的所谓建议只是对方无理主张的总和。对方的目的只是拖延双方会谈，以便对方破坏朝鲜停战，强迫扣留战俘，拒绝和平解决朝鲜问题，保持并制造紧张局势。我方断然拒绝对方的所谓建议草案。为了和平，我方要求对方认真考虑并接受我方十一月三十日的全面建议。
    美方代表迪安在其荒谬与欺骗性的建议遭到我方彻底揭露之后，竟恼羞成怒，对苏联及朝中方面横肆诬蔑与诽谤，并横蛮地对我方提出终止会谈的威胁。我方代表黄华先生当即予以驳斥，并指出：对方以诬蔑、谩骂代替会议的语言，适足以证明对方阴谋以这种挑衅的办法来完全破坏双方会谈，如果对方决心不继续当前的会谈，就应作出明白的表示，并负担破坏双方会谈的全部责任。
    奇石福先生的发言全文如下：
    我们仔细的研究了你们十二月八日提出的“建议草案”，我不能不再一次指出：你方的所谓“建议草案”，不仅是你方各种无理主张的总和，而且在许多重要问题上，甚至比你方过去在这个会上所表示的还倒退了一些。你们坚持苏联不是中立国的荒谬主张，你们坚持对中立国参加政治会议的各种无理限制，并拒绝在这个会上确定参加政治会议的中立国。你们反对在这个会上确定政治会议的议程。你们坚持垄断本方参加国家表决权利的表决程序。你们甚至无视政治会议是双方对等会议的原则，荒谬地主张政治会议的议事规则与行政安排，要由你方自称你方所代表的联合国秘书长派人来和双方商定。你们究竟确定地答应了什么呢？在一个遥遥无期的日子，在你方早就提出的日内瓦开政治会议，中立国呢？政治会议的议程呢？将来再说。迪安先生：这不就是你们所一贯主张而为我方所一贯反对的将政治会议分成所谓两个阶段来进行的老花样吗？双方会谈谈了四十三天，你们还站在原来的地方不动，这不是你们有计划地拖延是什么？你提出这样一个荒谬无理的方案，还在会外说这是你们的“最后建议”，要我们接受。你以为我们可能接受吗？这是不行的。我们再次郑重声明：我们断然拒绝这个方案。
    在苏联以中立国的身分参加政治会议的问题上，你方丝毫没有改变你方荒谬无理的主张。你方仍然不顾事实，蛮不讲理地否认苏联为中立国，并坚持苏联作为交战双方中一方的国家参加政治会议，难道这就是你方为了促成政治会议早日召开的“热诚努力”？请不要荒唐了吧！如果你方还不明白我方在这个问题上的立场，那么再次告诉你方：苏联的中立性是事实，是真理，因此是无可否认、不可争辩的。苏联必须以中立国的身分参加政治会议。
    你方在十二月七日的发言中，已经承认参加政治会议的中立国家“不应该为不可行的与不实际的会议程序和不必要的限制性的规则所阻碍”，但是你方的所谓“建议草案”却正是以不可行的与不实际的会议程序和不必要的限制性的规则来使中立国根本不能在政治会议中发挥其作用。你方在所谓“建议草案”中不仅没有放弃你方对中立国在政治会议中的权限所早已提出过的种种无理限制，而且更增加一层新的限制，连中立国提建议的权利都加以剥夺。你方提案使中立国参加政治会议变成一幕滑稽戏，有自尊心的中立国是不会来参加的。
    我方早已具体建议邀请苏联、印度、印度尼西亚、巴基斯坦和缅甸五个中立国家参加政治会议，你方始终拒绝我方所提名的五个中立国家，但是又提不出任何站得住的理由。你方同意在目前的双方会谈中解决中立国参加政治会议的问题，你方至少在表面上也已同意有邀请中立国参加政治会议的必要，但是你方的所谓“建议草案”却是拒绝确定参加政治会议的中立国，实际上把邀请中立国家参加政治会议的问题压置起来不加解决，这不仅是倒退了一步，而且简直是个骗局。
    你方在十二月七日的发言中，已经承认我方所建议的政治会议的议程项目是“符合于停战协定和有关战俘的职权范围的”，并且“必须在政治会议中加以处理”，但是你方在所谓“建议草案”中，却又反对在目前的双方会谈中确定政治会议的议程。我方建议的政治会议的议程既然完全符合停战协定中的有关规定，你们就没有理由反对，更没有理由反对在双方会谈中就将政治会议的议程确定下来。你们的建议对于一些行政事务的问题，倒提出不少无理的但是具体的意见，而对于中立国参加政治会议以及政治会议议程等中心问题却延不解决，你们这样做究竟抱着怎样不可告人的目的？
    关于政治会议的表决程序，你们的所谓新建议虽然没有再提单位表决这个名字，但实际上你们仍然坚持垄断本方参加国家表决权的表决程序。如果你方不是为了替你方某些成员国家预留破坏协议的后步，你们有何理由坚持这种表面上叫做简单化、但实际上并不解决问题的表决程序？
    你方在十二月七日的发言中说：“至于你们关于草案议事规则的方式与关于行政事宜的建议，我方的意见大致是相似的”，又说：“这些事项可以在政治会议召开以前由双方代表连同所在地政府的代表协商之后向政治会议作建议”。但是一天以后，你方在所谓“建议草案”中却荒谬地建议要求联合国秘书长为政治会议提供联合秘书处和同时传译的设备。尤其荒谬的是你方建议双方代表与联合国秘书长指派的代表共同商定政治会议的议事规则及其他有关的行政与程序事项。这与我方根据双方对等会议原则所提出的合理建议有何相似之处？我方昨天已经指出，你方似乎忘记了联合国机构中并无朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国的代表。你方自称是代表联合国的一方，而且正是这个机构在美国操纵之下前不久还对朝中方面进行诽谤和诬蔑。我方实在不能设想你方如何能提出如此荒谬可笑的建议。我方并不低估你方的智慧，但是你方提出这种建议来只能使我方得出一个结论，那就是你方有意制造争论，使双方不能迅速达成协议。
    为了促使双方迅速达成协议，我方已经放弃了前所建议的召开政治会议的地点，并提出了你方无法反对的印度新德里，你方却又找寻了新的但是站不住的藉口来加以反对。不仅如此，你方更退回到你方前所建议的日内瓦，不论你方如何诡辩，也不能把你方这种倒退的作法称为“诚意的建议”。
    很明显，你方的所谓“建议草案”不是为了解决问题，而是为了进一步阻挠政治会议的召开而提出的。正因为如此，你方反对我方提出的在十二月二十八日召开政治会议的建议，你方在所谓“建议草案”中，不仅坚持旧的无理主张，而且更增加了新的荒谬主张，使双方更难达成协议，从而无限期地拖延政治会议的召开，这样就可以便于你方达到强迫扣留我方被俘人员、阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决和保持世界紧张局势等罪恶阴谋。这种罪恶的阴谋是你方不论用任何欺骗的手法也掩盖不住的。全世界爱好和平的人民决不容许你方这种罪恶的阴谋实现。如果你方不希望在世界人民的打击下遭到新的可耻的失败，你方就应该老老实实地以我方的全面建议为基础努力谋求协议，以便迅速召开政治会议。
