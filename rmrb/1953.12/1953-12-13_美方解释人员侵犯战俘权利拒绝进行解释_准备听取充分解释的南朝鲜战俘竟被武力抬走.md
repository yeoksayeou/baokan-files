Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, December 11th: Today, the Syngman Rhee explanation personnel became even more agitated. They refused to say anything to the POWs about their future and lives, and withdrew from the tents, forcing the subsidiary organs to use force to carry away compliant POWs who were requesting full explanations. As a result, the POWs who were prepared to listen to explanations today had to protest to the subsidiary organs about the Syngman Rhee explanation personnel's violation of the POWs' right to hear explanations, and demanded that the subsidiary organs guarantee that they would be given full explanations. Because the Syngman Rhee explanation personnel adopted an attitude of evasion and refusal to explain, the five POWs who had been to the explanation tents today without hearing explanations, and the twenty-five POWs waiting to hear explanations, all returned to their original camps.

    When a young female POW asked the Syngman Rhee explanation personnel to talk about the situation of life in South Korea, the American observer immediately gestured to the explanation personnel, and the two of them left the tent together. Then, the Swiss representative asked the subsidiary organs to expel her from the tent. The female POW protested: "It is wrong to force me to make a decision without explaining it to me." The female POW stayed in the tent, waiting for the explanation personnel to return to hear the explanation, but the explanation personnel still refused to return to the tent. In the No. 5 explanation tent, a POW asked the Syngman Rhee explanation personnel to specifically explain the seven guarantees in the "Proclamation" of the Syngman Rhee Minister of National Defense. The POW said: "For example, priority is given to introducing occupations. What kind of occupations are introduced? I couldn't find a job in South Korea in the past, and no one introduced me to a job. Why is that? Also, for example, you can go to school. Are the schools ready? What kind of schools are they? What about tuition? When I was in South Korea, like many people, I couldn't go to school without money. This is different from what you are saying now. I hope you can explain it again." The Syngman Rhee explanation personnel refused to clarify these questions about the POW's future and life, but said agitatedly: "If you believe me, come with me; if you don't believe me, I can't do anything." The POW said: "You just read a few sentences of the proclamation in general terms. How can that make me believe you? Please give me a specific explanation. Didn't you say you were here to help me?" The explanation personnel immediately glared and said gruffly: "I am helping you, not saying that if you don't have rice at home, I will give you rice, or if you don't have money at home, I will give you money. I am here today to help you choose which door to go out of." The POW patiently and quietly asked: "If you don't tell me the real situation in South Korea, how can I choose which door to go out of? Please tell me more specifically!" This Syngman Rhee explanation personnel ignored the POW and turned to announce to the chairman of the subsidiary organs: "The explanation is over," forcing the subsidiary organs to use force to carry the POW who patiently requested an explanation of his questions out of the tent.

    For several consecutive days, the U.S. side has refused to give POWs full explanations in Songgok-ri, and even used vulgar language such as "son of a bitch" to insult POWs, violating their dignity and rights. In Dongjang-ri, the U.S. side has instructed Lee and Chiang Kai-shek secret agents to do everything possible to prevent POWs from listening to explanations, bringing the explanation work on the Korean-Chinese side to a standstill for a long time. This attitude of the U.S. side shows that they completely disregard the rights that POWs should enjoy according to the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission."

### 美方解释人员侵犯战俘权利拒绝进行解释  准备听取充分解释的南朝鲜战俘竟被武力抬走

    美方解释人员侵犯战俘权利拒绝进行解释
    准备听取充分解释的南朝鲜战俘竟被武力抬走
    【新华社开城十一日电】今天，李承晚解释人员变得更加暴躁，他们不愿对战俘说一点儿有关他们前途和生活的话就退出帐篷，迫使附属机构使用武力把要求听取充分解释的遵守规矩的战俘抬走。因此，今天准备听取解释的战俘不得不向附属机构对李承晚解释人员侵犯战俘听取解释的权利的行为提出抗议，并且要求附属机构保证给予他们听取充分解释。由于李承晚解释人员采取躲避和拒绝进行解释的态度，今天到过解释帐篷而没有听到解释的五个战俘和等待听取解释的二十五个战俘都回到了原营场。
    一个年青的女战俘要求李承晚解释人员谈一些南朝鲜的生活情形时，美国观察代表立刻对解释人员做了个手势，两个人就一起离开了帐篷。接着，瑞士代表就要求附属机构把她撵出帐篷。这个女战俘抗议说：“还没对我进行解释就强迫我作出决定是不对的。”这个女战俘就留在帐篷里，等候解释人员回来听取解释，但是解释人员仍然拒绝回帐篷去。在第五号解释帐篷中，一个战俘要求李承晚解释人员具体解释李承晚国防部长官“文告”中的七项保证。战俘说：“譬如说，优先介绍职业，介绍什么职业？我过去在南朝鲜找不到职业，也没有人替我介绍职业，这是为了什么？又譬如可以上学，是不是已准备好了学校？上什么样的学校？学费怎么办？我在南朝鲜时像很多人一样，没有钱进不了学校，这和你们现在所说的不一样。希望你能再解释一下。”对于这些有关战俘的前途和生活的问题，李承晚解释人员都拒绝澄清，只是暴躁地说：“你相信我，就跟我走；不相信我，我也没办法。”战俘说：“你只是笼笼统统地念了几句文告，怎能使我相信呢？请你对我作具体的解释。你不是说你是来帮助我的吗？”解释人员立刻瞪起眼睛粗声怪气地说：“我帮助你，不是说你家里没有米就给你米，你家里没有钱就给你钱，我今天是来帮助你走哪个门出去。”战俘又耐心而安静地要求道：“你不告诉我南朝鲜的真实情况，我怎么走哪个门呢。还是请你讲具体一些吧！”这个李承晚解释人员就再也不理睬这个战俘，回过头来向附属机构主席宣布：“解释完了”，迫使附属机构使用武力把这个耐心地要求解释疑问的战俘抬出帐篷去。
    连续几天来美方在松谷里拒绝给予战俘充分解释，甚至用“婊子养的”之类下流话辱骂战俘，侵犯战俘的尊严和权利。而在东场里美方却指使李、蒋特务想尽办法阻止战俘听取解释，使朝中方面的解释工作陷于长期停顿。美方的这种态度表明：他们完全蔑视战俘根据“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”所应享有的权利。
