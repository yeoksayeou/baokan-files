    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, December 30th: A unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Kim Sung front in Korea has completed the 1953 construction project to help the Korean people rebuild Changdo Township.
    Changdo Township, where the Changdo County People's Committee of Gangwon Province is located, was a beautiful industrial area before the outbreak of the Korean People's Anti-Aggression War. During the war, the city suffered serious damage from the US aggressor army's air force, and the city's houses were bombed into rubble. In early October of this year, a unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army decided to help the local government and people rebuild Changdo Township. After more than two months of hard work, a batch of new buildings has reappeared on the ruins of Changdo Township. Among these buildings are a cinema that can accommodate more than 1,000 spectators, a senior high school that can accommodate more than 300 students, and a hospital with more than 20 wards, all rebuilt with the help of the Volunteer Army unit. In addition, the Volunteer Army unit helped the Changdo County People's Committee and other government agencies build more than 40 houses. Currently, these newly completed buildings have been handed over to the Changdo County People's Committee. The Changdo County People's Committee and other government agencies have moved into new houses to work, and the hospital has begun to receive inpatients.
    In the reconstruction project of Changdo Township, the Volunteer Army soldiers and the people of Changdo Township worked together. In order to supply construction materials in time, the people of Changdo Township actively went to the mountains to cut trees, cut grass, and quarry stones, and enthusiastically contributed their sorghum stalks and rice straw. In the construction, the Volunteer Army soldiers who were mainly responsible for the labor worked more than eight or nine hours a day. In their work, they also tried to overcome difficulties to save materials for the Korean people and strive for an early completion. Many soldiers persisted in their work even when their hands and feet were cracked from the severe cold of minus fifteen degrees Celsius. The soldiers of the Hu Guien group, who were responsible for sawing wood, once worked continuously for four days and nights, resting only three or four hours a day. The soldiers also used old and waste products to make many tools. They said: Saving a nail is also adding a point of strength for the Korean people.
    In order to thank the Volunteer Army for their help, the Changdo County People's Committee and the people built a cement monument next to the newly built cinema. The monument is engraved with the deeds of the Volunteer Army unit helping the Korean people rebuild Changdo Township. Kim Yong-seok, vice chairman of the Changdo County People's Committee, said: "The Volunteer Army defended the freedom and independence of our country with their blood and flesh, and helped us heal the wounds of war with the greatest enthusiasm. Such great friendship can only appear in the big family of the peace and democracy camp. We will cherish these buildings built by the hands of the Volunteer Army as we cherish the great friendship between the Chinese and Korean people."

    我志愿军某部帮助朝鲜人民重建昌道邑
    【新华社平壤三十日电】朝鲜金城前线中国人民志愿军某部，已经完成了一九五三年度帮助朝鲜人民重建昌道邑的建筑工程。
    江原道昌道郡人民委员会所在地——昌道邑，在朝鲜人民反侵略战争爆发以前是一个美丽的工业区。战争期间，这座城市遭受到美国侵略军空军的严重破坏，全市房屋被炸成一片瓦砾。今年十月上旬，中国人民志愿军某部决定帮助当地政府和人民重建昌道邑，经过两个多月的艰苦劳动，一批新的建筑物已经在昌道邑的废墟上重新出现了。在这批建筑物中，有志愿军部队帮助重建的一座能容一千多观众的电影院、一所能容三百多名学生的高级中学和一所有二十多间病房的医院。此外，还有志愿军部队帮助昌道郡人民委员会等政府机关修建的四十多间房子。目前这些已经落成的新建筑都已移交给昌道郡人民委员会。昌道郡人民委员会等政府机关已经搬进新屋办公，医院里已开始接收住院病人。
    在重建昌道邑工程中，志愿军战士和昌道邑人民共同劳动。为了及时供应建筑材料，昌道邑人民积极地上山伐树、割草、开凿石头，并且踊跃地拿出自己的秫秸和稻草。在施工中，担任主要劳动的志愿军战士们，每天工作都在八、九小时以上。他们在劳动中还想办法克服困难为朝鲜人民节省材料，并争取早日完工。许多战士在零下十五度的严寒天气里，手脚冻裂了仍坚持劳动。担任锯木料的胡贵恩小组的战士们，有一次曾连续工作四昼夜，每天只休息三、四小时。战士们还利用旧品、废品制造了许多工具。他们说：能节省一根钉子，也是为朝鲜人民增加一分力量。
    为了感谢志愿军的帮助，昌道郡人民委员会和人民在新落成的电影院旁，修建了一座水泥的纪念碑。碑上刻着志愿军部队帮助朝鲜人民重建昌道邑的事迹。昌道郡人民委员会副委员长金龙石说：“志愿军以血肉保卫了我们国家的自由和独立，又以最大的热情帮助我们医治战争创伤，只有在和平民主阵营的大家庭里，才能出现这样伟大的友谊。我们将像爱护中朝人民的伟大友谊一样来爱护这些由志愿军的手建筑起来的建筑物。”
