    Long-Term and Unremitting Efforts to Study Business

    Today's article "Blind Complacency is the Enemy of Studying Business" published in this newspaper, clearly illustrates that cadres transferred to industrial and mining enterprises must follow Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions: "...must learn economic work from all experts (regardless of who they are). Take them as teachers, learn respectfully and honestly. If you don't understand, you don't understand, don't pretend to understand. Don't put on bureaucratic airs. Delve into it, for a few months, a year or two, three to five years, and you can always learn it." ("On the People's Democratic Dictatorship") This is because industrial production, especially modern industrial production, is a science. Without certain scientific and technological knowledge and knowledge of production management, it is impossible to manage industrial production well. Cadres transferred to industrial and mining enterprises in various places are precisely unfamiliar with this aspect of knowledge. Therefore, we must "learn respectfully" and "learn honestly," and it must be a "year or two, three to five years" of long-term and unremitting learning. When Comrade Wang Yue Ruo first arrived at the Gejiu Tin Mine Concentrator, he was able to study in this way, and thus he initially understood the basic situation of the concentrator, and initially understood the basic knowledge of production management. As a result, the production management of the concentrator was initially improved, and the production of the concentrator began to exceed the state's tasks. Logically speaking, Comrade Wang Yue Ruo should have continued to work hard to learn and manage the concentrator better. However, Comrade Wang Yue Ruo became complacent because of this and no longer worked hard to study business. Instead, he just sat in the office listening to reports and reviewing official documents. This bureaucratic work style was of course not in line with the requirements of the superiors, so Comrade Wang Yue Ruo complained that the instructions of the superiors were not specific, did not solve the problem, or were not in line with the actual situation; of course, it was also not in line with the requirements of everyone, so Comrade Wang Yue Ruo complained that other comrades were progressing too slowly to become his strong assistants, and complained that workers were lax in discipline and could not carry out production according to their own intentions. As a result, the production of the concentrator declined and the state's production tasks could not be completed. When Comrade Wang Yue Ruo was transferred to the Datun Concentrator, he was able to go deep into the front lines and deep into the masses, learning while working, and the production of this plant gradually increased, exceeding the state's tasks. This vividly illustrates the correctness of Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions. All cadres transferred to industrial and mining enterprises must follow Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions to learn respectfully and honestly, and work hard to learn for a year or two, three to five years, and do it persistently. This will not only enable them to learn, but also to do their work well. Otherwise, they will not learn well, they will not be able to learn, and they will not be able to do their work well.

    This also shows that even those who have the same early problems as Comrade Wang Yue Ruo; or those who have not even tried to study business hard, as long as they can discover their mistakes in time, correct their mistakes, and honestly study business, they can still learn economic work and still be good cadres of the Party. Comrade Wang Yue Ruo is a very good example.

### 长期不懈地努力学习业务

    长期不懈地努力学习业务
    今天本报所发表的“盲目自满是钻研业务的敌人”一文，很好地说明了转业到工、矿企业部门工作的干部，必须按照毛泽东同志指示“……必须向一切内行的人们（不管什么人）学经济工作。拜他们做老师，恭恭敬敬地学，老老实实地学。不懂就是不懂、不要装懂。不要摆官僚架子。钻进去，几个月，一年两年，三年五年，总可以学会的。”（“论人民民主专政”）这是因为工业生产，特别是近代化工业生产是一种科学，没有一定的科学技术知识和管理生产的知识，是无法管理好这些工业生产的。而各地转业到工、矿企业部门的干部，对这方面的知识恰恰是不熟悉的。因此我们必须“恭恭敬敬地学”、“老老实实地学”，而且是“一年两年，三年五年”的长期不懈的学。王月如同志初到个旧锡矿选矿厂时，也还能这样去学习，因而初步了解了选矿厂的基本情况，初步了解了管理生产的基本知识，选矿厂的生产管理因此有了初步的改善，选矿厂的生产也开始超额完成国家的任务。照理说，王月如同志应当是继续努力学习，把选矿厂管理得更好。但是王月如同志却因此自满起来，不再努力学习业务，而只是坐在办公室里听汇报，批阅公文。这种官僚主义作风当然与上级的要求是不相符合的，于是王月如同志埋怨上级指示不具体不解决问题或者是不符合实际情况；当然与大家的要求也是不相符合的，于是王月如同志埋怨其他同志进步太慢，不能成为自己有力的助手，埋怨工人纪律松懈，不能按照自己的意图进行生产。其结果，选矿厂的生产就下降，国家的生产任务就完不成。当王月如同志调到大屯选矿厂后，又能深入现场，深入群众，一面学习，一面工作，这个厂的生产就逐步上升，超额完成了国家任务。这多么生动地说明了毛泽东同志指示的正确。一切转业到工、矿企业部门工作的干部必须按照毛泽东同志指示去恭恭敬敬、老老实实地学习，一年两年，三年五年，长期不懈地努力学习，这不仅能学会，而且能把工作做好。否则就学不好，学不会，也做不好工作。
    这也说明了，同样犯有王月如同志初期毛病的人；或者根本还没有努力学习业务的人，只要能够及时发现自己的错误，改正自己的错误，老老实实地学习业务，仍可以学会经济工作的，仍不失为是党的好干部。王月如同志就是一个很好的榜样。
