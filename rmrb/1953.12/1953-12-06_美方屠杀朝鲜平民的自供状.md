After the US government's shameful attempt to use the United Nations platform to whitewash its crimes of bacteriological warfare failed, it is now concocting a conspiracy in the United Nations General Assembly accusing the Chinese and Korean People's forces of committing "atrocities" against prisoners of war and civilians.

The US government's continued use of these despicable tactics is an attempt to cover up the various war crimes it committed during the Korean War, to conceal its conspiracies to undermine the repatriation of prisoners of war and obstruct the convening of political conferences, to damage the prestige of China and Korea among the people of the world, and to save itself from complete moral bankruptcy.

But the US government's approach is in vain.

The insane slaughter of Korean civilians by the invading US military and other serious war crimes are already known throughout the world. These are things that the American executioners cannot hide. John Foster Dulles, the spokesman for the US reactionaries and current US Secretary of State, reluctantly admitted on September 17th of last year: "Most of the world today believes that we (the United States) have committed unspeakable atrocities." In particular, the Asian people neighboring Korea know this more clearly, and are therefore more angry and shocked. Dulles said: "... a billion Asians believe that we are not only militarists, but the most barbaric militarists, waging war with bacteria, napalm bombs, and other terrible means against defenseless towns and women and children. ... At least 90 percent of all Asians are horrified by what they believe to be the barbaric means we are using in Korea." (Associated Press, San Francisco, September 17, 1952)

The unspeakable atrocities committed by the United States in Korea, as Dulles admitted, have been exposed to the world by the people of China and Korea and many international impartial organizations and upright individuals. Even the pro-American and British propaganda machines that frequently defended the invading US military have revealed some of these facts.

Less than two months after the outbreak of the Korean War, Osborne, a reporter for the American reactionary magazines "Time" and "Life" stationed in Korea, reported in "Time" published on August 21, 1950: "I have to say that this is a particularly terrible war. Because we want to win, we force our soldiers to adopt the most savage actions and styles on the battlefield. This savagery is not the ordinary inevitable savagery on the battlefield, but: more cruel and savage than that. Regardless of whether there are enemies there, villages are completely destroyed; refugees are indiscriminately killed. The South Korean army fighting alongside us is equally savage and inhumane. I personally saw South Korean police killing prisoners alive when they were escorting them back to the rear, for fear of danger. When they retreated from the front line, they even strafed the civilians filling the road in order to escape. The barbaric means they used to extract the information we needed from civilians are even more unspeakable." Osborne admitted that the US military's use of such inhuman and barbaric means was planned and prepared by the US government long ago. Osborne said: "In American history, we have never prepared for a war as fully as we have prepared for this one." Preparing so fully to go to a foreign country 14,000 miles away to slaughter civilians and prisoners by the thousands, and to destroy cities and villages entirely, is unprecedented in history.

Killing civilians in war has long been strictly prohibited by civilized mankind. The Geneva Convention of August 12, 1949, concerning the protection of civilians in wartime, explicitly prohibits murder, torture, collective punishment, and all means of intimidation or terror, as well as pillage and destruction. But the US government, like it treats the 1925 Geneva Protocol on the prohibition of bacteriological weapons, disregards and tramples on such humanitarian principles and international conventions at will. Thompson, a reporter for the British bourgeois newspaper "Daily Telegraph Morning Post," published a book in the winter of 1951 describing the Korean War, entitled "Cry Korea." In this book, this British reporter, who echoed the American policy of aggression against Korea, wrote that American soldiers were "people who enjoy shooting for fun." Thompson described the atrocities he witnessed of the US and Lee aggressor forces massacring innocent civilians when they advanced to the Yalu River and retreated to the 38th parallel, saying: "I have become accustomed to many kinds of deaths that I could not have imagined before. ... I deeply remember ... the terrifying scene of corpses lying in disarray in the mass grave. ... People were roasted alive, or starved into grotesque shapes." Thompson said: "As far as I can see, the Americans have never considered that these Koreans are also men, women, and children. ... It is certain that it indiscriminately kills a large number of civilians, men, women, old and young, and destroys everything they own." This British reporter, who was with the murderers, therefore had to call himself a "death reporter."

However, those American reporters who have completely lost their humanity are proud of the invading US military's massacre of Korean civilians. The Associated Press shamelessly boasted about the US military's slaughter of the people of Chongjin on October 16, 1951, saying: "The 190,000 residents of Chongjin were just targets for our gunners to fire at."

American bandits who "enjoy shooting for fun" not only used Korean peaceful residents as "targets" on the front line, but also carried out equally cruel massacres against displaced refugees in the rear. Osborne, the "Time" and "Life" magazine reporter mentioned above, described such a barbaric event in his dispatch:

Osborne said: "Once, at midnight, there were scattered gunshots around the mountains. The phone rang from the outpost. An officer picked up the receiver and listened for a while, then turned around and said: 'Oh no, what should we do? Three or four hundred refugees are coming towards Company B.' The commanding colonel replied: '... If you're happy, just shoot at them. I said, if you're happy.' So, this order was passed down over the phone."

People all over the world who have parents, wives, and children, think about it, the US military colonel who ordered his soldiers to "shoot straight at" the refugees may now be getting a medal from the US government! Righteous mankind will not allow such heinous executioners to go unpunished.

The insane atrocities of the US military and the Lee Syngman gang, which it cultivated and commanded, in massacring the Korean people even caused terror among some officers and soldiers in the British accomplice army participating in the war of aggression against Korea. A Reuters report on December 16, 1950, described the tragic incident of the US military and Lee Syngman gang armies collectively massacring innocent Korean civilians that British soldiers witnessed. Among the 34 Korean civilians killed that time, there were two women and two children. Reuters said: "They had no right of appeal, and no specific charges were announced against them—especially the children." "The execution started at 7:30 a.m. and ended at 8:10 a.m. It was disgustingly cruel. ... The youngest was a boy about eight years old. He knelt in a trench, crying, waiting to be shot. He turned his head to look at a guard. The guard cursed him, told him to turn his face away, and then shot him." Reuters said: The British soldiers who repeatedly witnessed such atrocities also "felt terrified." They cursed the US and Lee gangs, saying: "What are we doing coming to this ghostly place to fight for these bastards? As long as this kind of thing continues, the ideal of the entire UN Charter is finished."

This kind of collective massacre was everywhere in the areas occupied by the US military. On November 17, 1950, Cho Byeong-ok, the puppet Minister of Internal Affairs of South Korea, admitted that in the three or four days starting from November 13, the invading US military and the Lee Syngman gang arrested 55,909 people. These arrested people were massacred in batches. United Press admitted on December 16 of the same year that on December 11 alone, 578 people, including women and children, were brutally killed in the northern suburbs of Seoul. In Seoul alone, the "military tribunal" sentenced 84 such cases of mass "death sentences" in six days. Greenlees, a reporter for the British "Daily Mirror," reported on November 7 of the same year that 5,000 civilians were crowded into Seoul's prisons waiting for "judgment." The police beat the arrested unconscious in order to force confessions. Sixty people had to be locked up in a small room 15 feet long and 9 feet wide. One room contained fifty-four women and twelve babies. They could not lie down all day and all night, shivering in the cold. Some had not had water for four days and were waiting to die of hunger.

The number of civilians killed by the US military and the Lee Syngman gang in their massacre atrocities over the past three years is currently impossible to count. But American news agencies have repeatedly admitted that one million civilians were killed or injured in South Korea alone. The blood of these millions of innocent people must be repaid by the American aggressors with blood!

Along with the American aggressors' insane massacres, American generals also inhumanely boasted publicly about their plan to destroy Korea entirely. A report issued in May 1951 by the so-called "United Nations Korean Reconstruction Agency," which was obedient to the United States, quoted one of this "committee's" special representatives as saying: "I doubt whether there has ever been such a complete destruction of Korea in the history of the world since the sack of Carthage." How was this destruction caused? Take a look at a report by United Press reporter Moore on January 7, 1951: "The cold, hard fact, but the fact that must be faced, is that most of the destruction was done by the Americans for military needs." This American literary beggar, who delusionally used "military needs" as an excuse to absolve the invading US military of its guilt, also admitted that the Chinese and Korean troops always "avoided destructive attacks on towns," while "the UN forces, whether retreating or advancing, found it necessary to blow up and burn many towns in North Korea and virtually all of its industry." The fact is that "regardless of retreating or advancing," regardless of whether it was on the front line or in the rear, and regardless of whether there was any excuse, the US military implemented the shameful so-called "scorched earth" policy. Therefore, United Press shamelessly called the US military "skilled masters of destruction." This news agency said that when the invading US military retreated from Hungnam, they "set off more than 150,000 pounds of high explosives, leaving a pile of messy ruins in the Hungnam area." Another report from this news agency said that in the four days of December 1951, the US military "systematically" destroyed 107 Korean villages in the western Korean area. United Press reporter Chapman described: The US military's "high command" ordered the villages to be "burned to the ground," making the Korean people's "life's work disappear in black smoke," "burning them out of their homes and families," so that everywhere there were "old men and women, cripples, and children with faces hidden in despair, helplessness, and confusion."

The inhuman American bandits often took arbitrary destruction and looting as a skill. Associated Press reporter Lambert reported on December 26, 1950: "When fighting, combatants often destroy simple and non-military things such as a fence or a house." Lambert also cited the facts he witnessed: American soldiers used bulldozers to destroy a three-room mud-walled house for no reason, making a family homeless. A Reuters reporter reported on June 1, 1952, about the maritime bandits of the US and British invading forces landing on a small peninsula in Korea to rob civilians. Reuters said: More than 150 Marines who "even demons would be afraid of" "ignored the battle and went to rob communist farmers' cattle." They "regarded the cattle as great spoils of war." The commander of this force even "presented" a stolen cow to the captain as a "gift." See how shameless these shoulder-patched pirates are.

The crimes of the invading US Air Force in cruelly destroying peaceful Korean facilities and slaughtering peaceful Korean people are too numerous to mention. Korean cities, villages, churches, hospitals, schools, cultural relics, and ordinary farmers working in the fields were all targets of their bombing and strafing. They even dropped "toy bombs" specifically to injure children. The invading US military also openly announced that it would systematically bomb 78 cities in northern Korea.

These atrocities horrified many conscientious Americans. The American reactionary newspaper "New York Times" published a letter last year from a New York doctor named Fierst, saying: "I read in the May 9th issue of 'Time' magazine the story of how the UN Air Force destroyed the ancient city of Suan all day long in an air raid. At the beginning of this air raid, 12,000 gallons of burning gasoline were poured on the city and its residents. ... Undoubtedly, this would cause thousands upon thousands of elderly people, the sick, hospital patients, women, and children to be bombed to death or burned to death." This American doctor said: "In the 1930s, we watched newsreels of Italian fascists bombing Abyssinians. In the 1940s, we watched films of Nazis bombing European cities. But now, in the 1950s, we hear that the US Air Force is doing the same thing. How can we pretend to be at ease? ... No kind person in America or the world does not condemn this kind of thing."

It is precisely because the invading US military's heinous crimes have been unanimously condemned by the people of the world that the US government has been using various despicable and vile methods to try to cover up and quibble. The US military headquarters and the invading US military authorities in Korea have increasingly intensified the implementation of news censorship during the three-year-plus war of aggression against Korea, hoping to hide the increasingly serious atrocities of massacring civilians by the invading US military due to the failure of the war. The Associated Press reported: The US military's newly revised "extremely strict inspection regulations" in 1952 stipulated that "inspectors can delete anything they do not want to publish," including "illegal acts by the military in the rear," and so on. Recently, they even took fascist means to force the repatriated prisoners of war who had confessed to the US's bacteriological warfare crimes to "recant" and fabricated a big lie slandering the "atrocities" of the Chinese and Korean People's forces by stealing the bell while the thief cries "stop thief." But these ugly practices are as foolish as a murderer washing his hands in blood. The more he washes, the more obvious his crimes become.

The materials listed above about the invading US military's massacre of Korean civilians are only some of the materials that leaked out from under the scissors of the American news censors during the Korean War, and are obviously extremely incomplete. But even based on these incomplete materials, people can see that the seriousness of the invading US military's brutal crimes has exceeded Hitler's destruction of Warsaw and the Nanjing Massacre by the Japanese fascists. This part of the material is irrefutably recorded in American and British newspapers, which makes it even more impossible for the US government to cover up their war crimes, and thus even more impossible to escape the guilt they should bear.

    美方屠杀朝鲜平民的自供状
    李高
    美国政府在企图利用联合国讲坛洗刷它所犯下的细菌战罪行的可耻行为遭到失败之后，现在又在联合国大会上捏造朝中人民部队对战俘和平民施行“暴行”的阴谋。
    美国政府连续施行这种卑鄙手段，是希图借此掩盖它在侵朝战争中所犯下各种战争罪行，掩盖它在朝鲜破坏战俘遣返工作、阻挠政治会议召开的各种阴谋，以损害中朝两国在世界人民中的威信，而挽救它在道义上的彻底破产。
  但是，美国政府的这种做法是徒然的。
    侵朝美军对朝鲜人民的疯狂屠杀和其他种种严重的战争罪行，早已是举世皆知的了。这是美国的刽子手们无法掩盖的。美国反动集团的代言人、现任美国国务卿杜勒斯在去年九月十七日曾无可奈何地承认：“世界上大部地区的人，今天都认为我们
  （美国）干了大恶不赦的暴行。”特别是邻近朝鲜的亚洲人民知道得更清楚，因而也更为愤怒和震惊。杜勒斯说：“……十亿亚洲人相信我们不仅是军国主义者，而且是最野蛮的军国主义者，用细菌、汽油弹及其他可怕的手段对赤手空拳的村镇和妇孺进行战争。……在所有的亚洲人中，至少有百分之九十对他们所相信是我们在朝鲜使用的野蛮手段感到恐惧。”（美联社一九五二年九月十七日旧金山电）
    杜勒斯所承认的、美国在朝鲜所犯下的大恶不赦的暴行，除了朝中两国人民和许多国际公正团体与正直人士曾向全世界加以揭露之外，那些经常为侵朝美军辩护的美英宣传机器，也曾透露了其中的某些事实。
    侵朝战争发生后不到两个月，美国反动杂志“时代”和“生活”派驻朝鲜的记者奥斯本在一九五○年八月二十一日出版的“时代”上报道说：“我得说这是一场特别恐怖的战争。因为我们要获取胜利，所以就强迫自己的士兵在战场上采取最野蛮的行动和作风。这种野蛮，不是在战场上普通的不可避免的野蛮，而是：比那还要更残忍更野蛮的。不管那里有没有敌人，见了村庄就整个整个地彻底摧毁；对于难民不分皂白地杀害。和我们并肩作战的南朝鲜军队，也是同样的野蛮到惨无人道，我亲眼看见南朝鲜警察在押送俘虏回后方时，为了害怕危险而活活将俘虏杀死。在他们从前线溃退下来的时候，他们甚至扫射充塞路途的平民，以便夺路奔命。他们向平民探取我们所需要的情报时所用的野蛮手段，更是惨不忍述的。”奥斯本承认，美国军队采取这种惨无人道的野蛮手段，是美国政府早就计划、准备好了的。奥斯本说：“在美国历史上，我们没有一场战争在开始时，就准备得像这次那么充分的。”这样充分地准备着到一万四千英里以外的外国去成千成万地屠杀平民和俘虏，整个整个地毁灭城市和村庄，这在历史上是找不到任何先例的。
    在战争中屠杀平民，是文明人类早就严加禁止的。一九四九年八月十二日关于战时保护平民之日内瓦公约，就明文规定禁止谋杀、酷刑、集体惩罚及一切恫吓或恐怖手段，禁止掠夺和禁止破坏。可是美国政府对于这样的人道原则和国际公约，正像它对待一九二五年关于禁用细菌武器的日内瓦议定书一样，是毫无顾忌地任意加以践踏。英国资产阶级报纸“每日电讯晨邮报”记者汤普逊在一九五一年冬天出版了一本描写朝鲜战争的书“朝鲜的呼号”。在这本书中，这个附和美国侵朝政策的英国记者曾经写道：美国士兵是一些“以开枪取乐的人”。汤普逊描写他所目睹的美李侵略军在前进到鸭绿江又溃退到三八线时屠杀无辜平民的暴行说：“我已看惯了许多种从前无法想像的死法。……我深深地记得……死人坑中横七竖八的可怖情景。……人活活地被拿来烤，或者饿成了奇形怪状。”汤普逊说：
  “照我看来，美国人从来没有考虑到这些朝鲜人也是男人、女人和小孩。……确定无疑的是，它不分青红皂白大量杀死男女老幼的平民，毁灭他们所有的一切。”这个和杀人犯在一起的英国记者因此而不得不称他自己是“死亡报道者”。
    但是，那些已经完全失去了人性的美国记者们，却为侵朝美军对朝鲜平民的大屠杀而感到洋洋得意。美联社在一九五一年十月十六日无耻地夸耀美军屠杀清津市人民时的情况说：“清津城内十九万居民，对于我们的炮手说来，他们只是发射的靶子而已。”
    “以开枪取乐”的美国匪徒不仅在前线上拿朝鲜和平居民做“靶子”，对后方流离失所的难民也进行了同样惨酷的屠杀。上述的“时代”和“生活”杂志记者奥斯本在他的通讯中描述了这样一个野蛮的事件：
    奥斯本说：“有一次是在午夜的时候，在山岭的四周都有疏落的枪声。前哨摇来的电话响了，一个军官提起听筒听了一会，回头说道：‘哎呀，怎么办，三四百个难民正向B连走来。’指挥的上校答道：‘……如果你们高兴，就对正放枪好了。我说，如果你们高兴的话。’于是，这个命令就这样从电话传下去了。”
    全世界有父母妻子的人们想一想吧，这样命令他的士兵向难民“对正放枪”的美军上校，现在也许正得到了美国政府的勋章哩！对于这种万恶的刽子手，正义的人类是不会容许他们逍遥法外的。
    美国军队和它所培养、指挥的李承晚匪帮屠杀朝鲜人民的疯狂暴行，甚至曾引起参加侵朝战争的英国帮凶军中某些军官和士兵的恐怖。路透社在一九五○年十二月十六日的报道中描述了英国士兵看到的美军和李承晚匪帮军队集体屠杀朝鲜无辜平民的凄惨事件。那次被杀的三十四名朝鲜平民中，包括两个妇女两个小孩。路透社说：“他们没有上诉权利，也未宣布他们——特别是小孩子——的任何具体罪状”。“枪决从上午七时三十分开始，八时十分结束。那真是令人恶心地残忍。……最年青的一个是年约八岁的男孩子，他跪在一个壕沟里哭，等着被枪毙，他掉过头看一个卫兵。卫兵咒骂他叫他转过脸去，然后就枪毙了他。”路透社说：连连不断地目睹这种暴行的英国士兵也“感到恐怖”，他们咒骂美李匪帮说：“我们干什么到这种鬼地方来替这些王八旦打仗？只要这种事情还在继续下去，整个联合国自由宪章的理想就完蛋啦。”
    这种集体屠杀的暴行，在美军侵占的地区是到处都有的。一九五○年十一月十七日南朝鲜的伪内务部长官赵炳玉承认，从十一月十三日起的三、四天中，侵朝美军和李承晚匪帮就逮捕了五万五千九百零九个人。这些被逮捕的人一批一批地被屠杀了。合众社在同年十二月十六日承认，在十二月十一日一天中，就有包括妇女儿童在内的五百七十八人在汉城北郊惨遭杀害。这种成批的判处“死刑”的屠杀案件，仅汉城一地的“军事法庭”在六天中就判决了八十四件。英国“每日镜报”记者格林利斯在同年十一月七日报道说：五千平民被堆挤在汉城的监狱里等待“判决”。警察为了逼取口供，把被捕者打得昏了过去。在一间十五呎长九呎宽的小屋里要关六十个人。有一间关了五十四个妇女和十二个婴儿。他们整日整夜地无法躺下，在严寒中冻得发抖。有的四天喝不到水，在饥饿中等死。
    美军和李承晚匪帮的这种屠杀暴行，三年多中究竟杀死了多少平民，这是目前无法统计的。但是美国通讯社无数次承认，仅在南朝鲜就有一百万名平民死伤。这成百万无辜人民的鲜血，是必须美国侵略者用血来偿还的！
    随着美国侵略者的疯狂屠杀，美国将军们还毫无人性地公开夸耀他们的整个毁灭朝鲜的计划。听命于美国的所谓“联合国朝鲜复兴统一委员会”在一九五一年五月发表的一个报告中，引用这个“委员会”的一名特别代表的话说：“我怀疑世界历史上自从洗掠迦太基以来，是否有过像朝鲜这样彻底的毁灭。”这种毁灭如何造成的呢？请看看合众社记者摩尔在一九五一年一月七日的一段报道吧：“冷酷的事实，但也必须面对的事实是：大部分的破坏都是美国人因军事上的需要而干出来的。”这个妄想以“军事上的需要”做藉口来给侵朝美军推卸罪责的美国文丐也承认：朝中部队在战争中总是“避免对城镇作破坏性的攻击”，而“联合国军队不管是后退或者前进，都有必要炸毁和烧掉北朝鲜的许多城镇以及实际上是它的全部工业。”事实是“不管后退或前进”不管在前线或后方，不管有没有任何藉口，美国军队实行的是可耻的所谓“焦土”政策。因此，合众社竟无耻地称美国军队为“熟练的破坏的能手”。这个通讯社说，侵朝美军在兴南市溃退时，“燃放了十五万磅以上高度爆炸药，给兴南地区留下了一大堆杂乱的废墟。”这个通讯社的另一段报道说，在一九五一年十二月的四天当中，美军就在朝鲜西线地区“有系统地”破坏了一百零七个朝鲜村庄。合众社的记者查普曼描写道：美军“高级指挥部”下令把村庄“烧光”，使朝鲜人民“一生的劳动消失在黑烟里”，“把他们烧得没有住屋和家庭”，以致遍地是“脸上隐藏着绝望无援和茫然不知所措的老年男女，残废者和儿童”。
    灭绝人性的美国匪徒还常常以肆意破坏抢掠为能事。美联社记者兰伯特在一九五○年十二月二十六日报道说：“在作战的时候，作战的人时常像破坏一道篱笆或一座房子这种简单而没有军事意义的东西。”兰伯特并举出了他所目睹的事实：美国士兵无缘无故地用开路机撞毁一座三间泥墙的房子，把一家老小弄得流离失所。路透社记者在一九五二年六月一日报道了美英侵略军的海上强盗登陆朝鲜一个小半岛上抢劫平民的情况。路透社说：一百五十多名“魔鬼看了都害怕”的陆战队士兵“不顾战斗而去抢共产党农民的牛只”，他们“把牛只看做了不起的战利品”。这支部队的指挥官还把抢来的一头牛“呈献给舰长”做“礼物”。请看这些挂肩章的海盗们无耻到了什么地步。
    侵朝美国空军残忍地破坏朝鲜和平设施、屠杀朝鲜和平人民的罪行更是罄竹难书。朝鲜的城市、村庄、教堂、医院、学校、文化古迹和在田间操作的普通农民，都是他们轰炸、扫射的目标，他们甚至投下“玩具炸弹”来专门杀伤儿童。侵朝美军还公然宣布要有计划地炸毁朝鲜北部的七十八个城市。
    这种暴行使许多有良心的美国人也感到恐怖。美国反动报纸“纽约时报”去年发表一个纽约医生费尔斯特的来信说：“我在五月九日的‘时代’杂志上读到联合国空军如何以整天的空袭毁灭遂安古城的故事。这空袭的一开始就向这个城市及其居民倾倒了一万二千加仑燃烧汽油。……无疑地，这会使成千上万的老年人、病弱者、医院病人、妇女、小孩被炸死或者烧死。”这个美国医生说：“在三十年代里，我们细看过意大利法西斯轰炸阿比西尼亚人的新闻影片。在四十年代里，我们细看过纳粹轰炸欧洲城市的影片。而如今，在五十年代里，我们听到美国空军正干着同样的事情，怎么可以装得心安理得呢？……在美国或者全世界没有一个善良的人不谴责这种事情的。”
    正是由于侵朝美军的万恶罪行遭到了全世界人民的一致谴责，美国政府一直在使用各种卑鄙下流的办法企图掩饰和狡赖。美国军部和侵朝美军当局在三年多的侵朝战争中曾日益加紧实行新闻封锁，希图掩藏侵朝美军因战争失败而日益加甚的屠杀平民暴行。美联社报道说：一九五二年美军新订的“极为严格的检查条例”，规定“检查员可以删去他们所不愿发表的任何东西”，包括“军队在后方的不法行为”等等。最近，他们竟采取法西斯手段强迫遣返回去的曾经供认美国进行细菌战罪行的战俘“翻供”，并以贼喊捉贼的办法凭空制造诬蔑朝中人民部队“暴行”的弥天大谎。但这些丑恶做法正如杀人犯以血洗手一样愚蠢，越洗越使他的罪行昭彰。
    上面所列举的侵朝美军屠杀朝鲜平民的材料，都是在朝鲜战争期间从美国新闻检查官的剪刀下走漏出来的部分材料，显然是极不完全的。但即使根据这些不完全的材料，人们也可以看出，侵朝美军的残暴罪行的严重程度已经超过了希特勒的毁灭华沙和日本法西斯在南京的大屠杀。这部分材料都是铁案如山地记载在美英报纸上的，这使美国政府更加无法掩饰他们的战争罪行，从而也就更加无法逃避他们所应担负的罪责。
