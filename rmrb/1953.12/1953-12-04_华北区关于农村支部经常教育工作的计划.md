Xinhua News Agency, December 3rd:

    The North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, in order to strengthen the regular political and ideological education of rural party members, issued on November 21st an instruction on strengthening the regular education work of rural branches, and at the same time formulated the "North China Region's Plan for Regular Education Work in Rural Branches from November 1953 to October 1954," requiring its implementation in various localities.

    The plan first stipulates that the content of rural branch education in the current and foreseeable future should be: 1. The Party's general line during the transition period, focusing on the country's socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture; 2. The Party's specific policy on the mutual aid and cooperation movement in agricultural production and other important policies of the Party's work in rural areas; 3. The Party Constitution and the Party Member's Textbook; 4. The working methods and work style of branches and party members.

    Based on the various situations of Party branches in rural North China, the plan puts forward specific requirements: All Party branches that have undergone rectification should spend one year educating rural Party members on the general line, national industrialization, and the socialist transformation of agriculture, with emphasis on the socialist transformation of agriculture. All Party branches that have not undergone rectification should systematically conduct education on the eight requirements of Party member standards in conjunction with Party rectification. After this education is completed, education on the general line, national industrialization, and the socialist transformation of agriculture should be carried out. Newly established branches, or branches with more new party members, may organize party members to attend classes during the prescribed branch education time and systematically conduct education on the Party Constitution and the eight requirements of Party member standards. Branches with fewer new Party members may organize the new Party members from their affiliated branches to be concentrated by the township general branch during the slack season, or the district committee will be responsible for concentrating the new Party members in groups, to conduct several sessions of education on the Party Constitution and the eight requirements of Party member standards. All types of branches should regularly conduct education on current events and policies through party member and cadre meetings, pre-class speeches, or by organizing party members to participate in winter schools and people's schools. When assigning work tasks to the branches, the policies in the work should be explained clearly, and education on working methods and work style should be carried out.

    The plan also requires that when conducting this education, in addition to Party members, a certain number of non-Party activists can also be absorbed based on the principle of voluntarism, so that the backbone members of agricultural producers' cooperatives and the leaders of mutual aid teams can participate as much as possible.

    Regarding the selection and training of branch instructors, the plan points out: Setting up branch instructors is an important link in adhering to regular branch education, and all localities must pay attention to the selection and training of branch instructors. The methods to solve the source of branch instructors are: (1) District committee members should be the natural branch instructors and must insist on regularly giving classes to branch party members; (2) Each district should draw one or two people from the organizers, under the leadership of the district committee propaganda member, to be in charge of branch education work and give classes to branch party members; (3) Hire Party member cadres in the county and district people's governments and people's organizations who can serve as branch instructors to concurrently serve as branch instructors; (4) Select Party member cadres or general Party members from the branch who have a higher political and cultural level and have the ability to give lectures to serve as branch instructors; when county and district-level instructors come to the village to give lectures, they can serve as guidance. In order to ensure the quality of teaching and regular classes, we should adhere to the system of imparting knowledge to village branch instructors and the system of filling in cards after lectures.

    Regarding the teaching methods and class time, the plan stipulates: Branches that are close to the general branch can be concentrated to attend classes at the general branch; branches that are far from the general branch can be concentrated in groups to attend classes, or branches can attend classes as a unit; Party members in mountainous areas are very scattered, and it is also difficult to concentrate branches to attend classes, so people can be assigned to teach in groups. Under normal circumstances, classes should be held twice a month; during busy farming seasons, classes can be held once, and time should be used as much as possible during gaps. Each class should not exceed two hours. The content of the lecture should not be too much, but it should be linked to reality, explained thoroughly, and discussed well.

    The plan also makes specific provisions on how to solve the necessary funding problems for regular education work.

    The plan finally talks about the leadership of regular education work in rural branches. The plan requires Party committees at all levels to regularly study the ideological situation of Party members and branch education work, and to grasp the key points in order to absorb experience and guide the general. The propaganda departments of Party committees at all levels should have special personnel to manage the business work of branch education, and jointly with the organization department and rural work department of the Party committee at the same level, formulate branch education plans, and regularly inspect and summarize branch education work. The plan also specifically stipulates: The county party committee should have special personnel responsible for regularly inspecting and supervising branch education work, convene a branch education work meeting every three months, study and solve problems in branch education work, and exchange work experience. The county party committee should train branch instructors once during the winter training of grassroots cadres. The district committee should convene a meeting of branch instructors every three months. In addition to exchanging experiences, they should study the content of the teaching materials for the next stage. Each member of the district committee should combine his own general work to be responsible for the branch education work in a certain area and help the branch instructors prepare lessons. Where there are newspapers and periodicals, the Party committee should guide the newspapers and periodicals to run well the "Party Life" column. Where there are branch newsletters, the branch newsletters should be run well. The "Party Life" column and the branch newsletters should carry supplementary teaching materials for branch education, and regularly reflect the learning situation of Party members and introduce the experience of branch education work, so that they can become a powerful tool for guiding branch education work and become materials for Party members to study regularly.

    华北区关于农村支部经常教育工作的计划
    【新华社三日讯】中共中央华北局为了加强对农村党员的经常的政治思想教育，在十一月二十一日发出关于加强农村支部经常教育工作的指示，同时制订了“华北区一九五三年十一月到一九五四年十月关于农村支部经常教育工作的计划”，要求各地执行。
    计划中首先规定了在目前和今后相当长的时间内，农村支部教育的内容是：一、党在过渡时期的总路线，着重国家的社会主义工业化和农业的社会主义改造；二、党对农业生产中互助合作运动的具体政策和党在农村工作中的其他重要政策；三、党章、党员课本；四、支部和党员的工作方法与工作作风。
    计划根据目前华北农村中党的支部各种不同情况，提出了具体要求：凡已整过党的支部，都应以一年时间向农村党员进行关于总路线、国家工业化和对农业的社会主义改造的教育，并应以农业的社会主义改造为重点。凡未经过整党的支部，都应结合整党系统地进行一次党员标准八项条件的教育，这一教育结束后，就应进行总路线、国家工业化和对农业的社会主义改造的教育。新建立的支部，或新党员较多的支部，可在规定的支部教育时间内，组织党员上课，较系统地进行党章和党员标准八项条件的教育。新党员较少的支部，可在农闲时由乡总支集中所属新党员，或由区委负责分片集中新党员，进行几次党章和党员标准八项条件的教育。各种类型支部，都应通过党员干部会议、课前讲话或组织党员参加冬学、民校等方法，经常进行时事政策的教育，在向支部布置工作任务时，应讲清工作中的政策，并进行工作方法和工作作风的教育。
    计划并要求，在进行这一教育时，除党员外，还可依自愿原则吸收一定数量的非党积极分子，尽可能地使农业生产合作社的骨干分子和互助组的领导人员都能够参加。
    关于支部教员的选拔与培养，计划指出：设置支部教员，是坚持支部经常教育的重要环节，各地必须注意对支部教员的选拔与培养。解决支部教员的来源问题的方法是：（1）区委委员应是当然的支部教员，必须坚持经常给支部党员上课；（2）每区由组织员中抽出一人至二人，在区委宣传委员领导下，专管支部教育工作，并给支部党员上课；（3）聘请县、区人民政府、人民团体中能担任支部教员的党员干部兼任支部教员；（4）从支部中选择政治文化水平较高，并有讲课能力的党员干部或一般党员，担任支部教员；县、区级的教员到村讲课时，他们可担任辅导工作。为了保证教学质量和上课经常，应坚持对村支部教员的传授制度和讲课后填写卡片的制度。
    关于上课方法和上课时间，计划规定：分支离总支近的，可集中到总支上课；分支离总支远的，可分片集中上课，或以分支为单位上课；山区党员居住很分散，集中分支上课也有困难，可指定人在小组传授。一般情况下，每月上课两次；农忙时，可上课一次，并应尽可能利用空隙时间进行。每次上课时间不要超过两小时。讲的内容不应过多，但要联系实际，讲透彻，讨论好。
    关于如何解决经常教育工作所需的必要的经费问题，计划中也作了具体规定。
    计划最后谈到了农村支部经常教育工作的领导问题。计划要求各级党委要定期研究党员思想情况和支部教育工作，并要掌握重点以便吸取经验，指导一般。各级党委宣传部，要有专人管理支部教育的业务工作，并和同级党委组织部、农村工作部共同制订支部教育计划，定期检查和总结支部教育工作。计划并具体规定：县委应有专人负责经常检查和督促支部教育工作，每三个月召开一次支部教育工作会议，研究解决支部教育工作中的问题，交流工作经验。县委于冬季训练基层干部时，应训练一次支部教员。区委每三个月要召开一次支部教员会议，除交流经验外，要研究下一阶段的教材内容。区委委员每人应结合自己的一般工作，负责作好一片地区的支部教育工作，并帮助支部教员备课。凡有报纸、刊物的地方，党委要指导报纸、刊物办好
  “党的生活”栏。凡有支部小报的地方，要办好支部小报。“党的生活”栏和支部小报，都应刊载支部教育的辅助教材，并经常反映党员的学习情况，介绍支部教育工作的经验，使其成为指导支部教育工作的有力工具，并成为党员经常学习的材料。
