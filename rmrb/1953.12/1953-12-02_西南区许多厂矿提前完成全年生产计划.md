Many factories and mines in Southwest China have fulfilled their annual state plans for this year ahead of schedule. These include the Gejiu Ore Dressing Plant of Yunnan Tin Company, Chengdu Qianjin Iron Factory, Chengdu Food Company, Local State-owned Chongqing Measurement and Instrument Factory, light bulb workshop and battery workshop of Chongqing Electrical Equipment Factory, Borax Workshop of Gongjing By-product Department of Zigong Jiuda Company, Chongqing 501 Power Plant, Qijiang Iron Mine, Steelmaking Plant of Chongqing 104 Factory, and Longchang Carbon Black Factory. All these have completed this year's production tasks ahead of schedule in late October and mid-November.

The production plans of the above factories and mines this year are generally higher than those of last year, and the completion of the plans is also better. In addition to completing 100% of this year's output task, Longchang Carbon Black Factory increased its productivity by 409.16% compared with last year; the quality pass rate increased from 40.64% in January of this year to 99.37% in October; the ash content decreased from 0.76% in December last year to 0.06%, breaking through the upper-level requirement of not exceeding 0.38%; the tinting strength increased to 98%, and the average product cost from January to October was 40.16% lower than the state plan target, and the profit turned over exceeded the state plan by 72.66%. The Borax Workshop of Gongjing By-product Department of Zigong Jiuda Company has overfulfilled the task of turning over profits and reduced costs by 16%.

In fulfilling the first annual plan of China's first five-year plan, the workers of these factories and mines demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity. The workers of Chongqing 501 Power Plant persisted in working in workshops with a high temperature of 130 degrees Fahrenheit. The workers of the line section rushed to work under the scorching sun or in heavy rain, sometimes even neglecting to eat, and finally completed the overhaul and maintenance of the machine furnace and lines ahead of schedule, completing the annual power generation task 44 days in advance. From the beginning of this year to the present, the workers of Longchang Carbon Black Factory have put forward 665 rationalization proposals, of which 126 have been implemented, creating a value of more than 300 million yuan. Among them, a major one is the rationalization proposal by Zhao Yuanqing, an old worker in the second workshop, to open the skylight in the fire room, and the collective proposal by all the workers in the workshop to open the white iron sheet of the fire room. After successful testing, the average daily output increased by 3%, which can increase the country's wealth by more than 210 million yuan throughout the year. Through joint efforts, the workers of Qijiang Iron Mine have successively created 22 advanced experiences, such as the "one-character trapezoidal mining method," "V-shaped stage mining method," and "triangular slotting blasting method," which greatly improved productivity and ensured the completion of the annual production task ahead of schedule. Qiu Zegu, a young worker in the Borax Workshop of Gongjing By-product Department of Zigong Jiuda Company, created the "boron soil filtration method," which increased the daily evaporation from six pots to eight pots. In August, the workers raised the stove body, leveled the stove core, improved the flue, and increased the firepower, so that nine to ten pots could be evaporated every day. Coal consumption was reduced by 1.81%, and defective products were eliminated, and the national plan was fully completed two months ahead of schedule. The above achievements are inseparable from the in-depth mobilization of the masses and the solution of key production problems in the production reform and increase production and practice economy campaign in various factories and mines.

Now the workers of these factories and mines are working hard to create more wealth for the country. Chongqing 501 Power Plant is conducting safety assessment work intensively, striving to overfulfill the power generation by 16 million kWh, to increase production and save 3 billion yuan, and to turn over profits exceeding 11 billion yuan. Longchang Carbon Black Factory is further developing labor emulation, putting forward the slogan of overfulfilling the national production plan by 15%, and striving to overfulfill the glorious task of increasing production and saving 5 billion yuan in the second half of this year. The workers of Chengdu Food Company have revised the plan for increasing production and practicing economy, increasing it from the original 3 billion yuan to 7 billion yuan. The workers of the steelmaking plant of Chongqing 104 Factory expressed that they would continue to work hard to shorten the steelmaking time, extend the life of the furnace, and work with the workers of other workshops to strive to overfulfill the task of increasing production and practicing economy of 33.7 billion yuan for the whole factory this year.

    西南区许多厂矿提前完成全年生产计划
    西南区有一批厂矿提前完成了今年全年国家计划。这批厂矿包括云南锡业公司个旧选矿厂、成都市前进铁工厂、成都市食品公司、地方国营重庆度量衡厂、重庆电工器材厂灯泡车间和蓄电池车间、自贡久大公司贡井副产处硼砂车间、重庆五○一电厂、綦江铁矿、重庆一○四厂炼钢场、隆昌炭黑厂等，都相继在十月下旬和十一月中旬，提前完成了今年生产任务。
    上述各厂矿今年的生产计划比去年一般为高，完成计划也较好。隆昌炭黑厂除百分之百地完成今年产量任务外，生产率比去年提高了百分之四百零九点一六；质量合格率由今年一月份的百分之四十点六四提高到十月份的百分之九十九点三七；灰粉含量由去年十二月的百分之零点七六下降到百分之零点零六，突破了上级规定的不超过百分之零点三八的指标；着色力提高到百分之九十八，产品成本一至十月份平均比国家计划指标降低了百分之四十点一六，上缴利润超额完成国家计划百分之七十二点六六。自贡久大公司贡井副产处硼砂车间已超额完成上缴利润任务，并降低了成本达百分之十六。
    这些厂矿的职工，在完成我国第一个五年计划第一个年度计划中，表现了高度的积极性和创造精神。重庆五○一电厂职工在华氏一百三十度的高温车间坚持工作。线路工区的职工，在酷热的太阳下或在大雨中赶工，有时连饭都顾不上吃，终于提前完成了机炉和线路的检修维护工作，提前四十四天完成全年发电任务。隆昌炭黑厂的职工，从今年年初到目前为止，已提出六百六十五件合理化建议，已经实现了一百二十六件，创造价值约三亿元以上。其中较大的一项，是该厂二车间老工人赵远卿建议打开火房日光窗，和全车间职工集体建议开火房白铁皮的合理化建议，经试验成功后，日产量平均提高了百分之三，全年可为国家增产了二亿一千余万元的财富。綦江铁矿的职工共同努力，先后创造出二十二项先进经验，如“一字梯形开采法”、“V形阶段采矿法”、“三角形掏槽爆破法”等等，大大提高了生产率，保证提前完成了全年生产任务。自贡久大公司贡井副产处硼砂车间青工邱泽顾，创造了“硼土过滤法”，使以前每天蒸发六锅提高到八锅。八月份，工人又把灶身升高，灶心铺平，改进烟巷，加大了火力，每天可蒸发九锅到十锅。降低了煤耗百分之一点八一，并消灭了废次品，提前两个月全面完成了国家计划。上述这些成绩和各厂矿在生产改革与增产节约运动中深入发动群众，解决生产关键问题是分不开的。
    现在这些厂矿的职工正积极努力，争取为国家创造更多的财富。重庆五○一电厂正在紧张地进行安全查定工作，争取超额完成发电量一千六百万度，以增产节约三十亿元，超额上缴利润一百一十亿元。隆昌炭黑厂进一步深入开展劳动竞赛，提出超额完成国家生产计划百分之十五的口号，争取超额完成今年下半年增产节约五十亿元的光荣任务。成都市食品公司的职工，修订了增产节约计划，由原订的三十亿元增加到七十亿元。重庆一○四厂炼钢场工人表示要继续努力，缩短炼钢时间，延长炉子寿命，与其他车间工人一起，为超额完成全厂今年增产节约三百三十七亿元的任务而奋斗。
