The propaganda network in Haojia'nao Village, Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, was established in the summer of 1951 and consists of eighteen propagandists. In past work, propagandists carried out many propaganda activities and achieved certain results. However, there were also many problems in the work. First, propagandists were not good at publicizing the good people, good deeds, and good experiences of the local area, but instead copied or recited news from newspapers. For example, the blackboard newspaper in this village wrote news such as "Factory Safety Production Plan," "Workers Finding Tricks," and "India Sends an Elephant for Viewing," but did not publicize the village's experience in high-yield production and promoting close planting. Secondly, there were also phenomena of distorting policies and randomly propagating. For example, when mobilizing the masses to organize mutual aid teams, it was said: "Individual households and mutual aid teams are not allowed to exchange labor, and team members are not allowed to work for relatives." To Li Xiaosi, who was unwilling to deposit money in the bank, it was said: "You are disrupting work, and you are responsible if you fail to complete the task." Some propagandists were just figureheads. Among the eighteen propagandists, only five were actively engaged in propaganda work, six were pushed along, and five did not engage in propaganda at all. Propaganda tools were also unmanaged. The blackboard newspaper was broken and no one cleaned it up. The four loudspeakers became tools for calling people.

The main reasons for the above phenomena are: (1) The county and district Party committees relaxed their leadership over the work of the propaganda network. Although the village is only eight miles away from the county seat, the county and district committees rarely sent cadres to work in the village in the past year. On the other hand, it criticized the village for being backward, and criticized it three times in a row in last year's community evaluation work. As a result, some people said: "The district committee is focusing on model cases, and backward villages are only asked for materials and information." (2) Propaganda and instruction work was not done well. The propaganda instruction station only instructed five times in nine months. The instruction time was very long (one day), but few problems were solved. As a result, one-third of the propagandists did not go to listen to the instruction. (3) The branch did not fully understand the significance of establishing a propaganda network and lacked experience in leading the propaganda network. When the propaganda network was first established, some rules were stipulated, but they were slowly not implemented. For example, it was stipulated that the ideological situation of the masses should be studied regularly, which was a very important working system, but because some branch committee members said: "We are all from the same village, we meet every day, we understand each other, there is no need to study." This system was also cancelled. In the work, good deeds are not commended, and bad deeds are not criticized. Many propagandists felt that "it doesn't matter whether you propagate or not."

Based on the above situation, the work team reorganized the village's propaganda network: First, it learned about the work of the propaganda network, discovered problems, and studied methods to solve the problems through conversations with the propaganda network and branch committee members, and small forums with propagandists. Then, it started the reorganization of the propaganda network from three aspects.

(1) First, the branch committee members were organized to study the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Establishing a Propaganda Network for the People in the Whole Party," thereby initially solving the two ideological problems of the branch committee members: "the masses are backward, and the work is not easy to do" and "administrative orders are not good, but they can complete the task." Branch committee member Shi Fengxiang said: "The Party is right. Thinking back to the past struggle against the enemy, the masses supported us in posting slogans in the enemy's heart – Duan Village and Panlong. The enemy harassed us every day, but the masses never succumbed. The masses directly supported our struggle. If you say the masses are backward, it can only be blamed on us for not doing our job well." Branch committee member Shi Zhenyu said: "Studying has opened my mind. In the past, some of the work was inconsistent on the surface and at the lower levels, forming a 'vicious cycle'. For example, last year's Shi Jia'nao mutual aid team nominally organized 40 households, but in reality, only 10 households worked together. Forced orders really ruined good things." In this way, everyone affirmed that it is not that the masses are backward, but that the work is not in-depth. Only through propaganda and education can the work be done well. The practice of forced orders is bound to be opposed by the masses, causing the policies to go awry, and the work cannot be done well.

With the resolution of these ideas, everyone also criticized the district committee's erroneous attitude of relaxing the leadership of the propaganda network. The work team patiently listened to everyone's opinions and promised to convey them to the district committee for adoption. At the same time, it organized everyone to study the leadership experience of the Quzhai branch and examined their own work. Branch committee member Shi Fengxiang said: "It is not right to only criticize the district. Our own championship mentality and pessimistic mood really killed people. Last autumn, after the district criticized us for being backward, we made the mistake of forced orders in organizing mutual aid teams." Branch propaganda committee member Shi Zhenyu also reviewed his own problems of only talking but not doing, and not managing the propaganda network well. He also said: "In the past, I ignored the leadership of propagandists' studies, and only knew to hold meetings when there was no other way, which affected the enthusiasm of the propagandists. This should be changed in the future." Finally, it was unanimously agreed that it is necessary to strengthen the study of the masses' thoughts.

(2) Through the propaganda of agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation, the propaganda work level of the propagandists was improved and the development of mutual aid teams was promoted. The work team first convened a forum for branch committee members and activists among the propagandists. At the meeting, they studied documents such as the "Instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Spring Ploughing Production to Party Committees at All Levels" and the "Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Agricultural Production Mutual Aid and Cooperation," and focused on studying the thoughts of the masses and how to carry out propaganda work. At that time, the thoughts of some of the masses were very chaotic, and they did not understand the future of agricultural development. Many young people were not at ease with agricultural production and wanted to go to the city and to factories. In response to this situation, the "Instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Spring Ploughing Production to Party Committees at All Levels" and the "Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Agricultural Production Mutual Aid and Cooperation" and the benefits of being organized were deeply publicized. After such publicity, most of the masses understood and supported the "Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Agricultural Production Mutual Aid and Cooperation" and believed that "the real policy has come." However, some people also said: "Mutual aid is not as good as individual farming. In the old society, no one led us and we could still harvest grain." The propagandists reported these situations to the branch. The branch committee members conducted research and arranged for the propagandists on how to further publicize the benefits of mutual aid and cooperation. According to the instructions of the branch, the propagandists held discussions and conversations with the masses separately, and corrected some of the masses' misunderstandings about mutual aid and cooperation. After more than ten days of propaganda, about 65% of the farmers in Shi Jia'nao Village participated in mutual aid teams. The production mood of the masses stabilized and rose.

(3) Summarize and inspect the work of the propaganda network and set simple and easy-to-implement systems. Through the propaganda of rectifying mutual aid teams, the branch committee members and propagandists were educated with facts, proving that propaganda work can be done well. On this ideological basis, a general meeting of all branch members in the village was convened. The propaganda committee member made a summary report on the work of the propaganda network, pointing out the shortcomings of the past propaganda work, such as having too many meetings. At the same time, it pointed out that the main experience in this reorganization of the propaganda network was: grasping the study of propagandists, paying attention to the study of the masses' thoughts, patiently persuading and educating the masses, and vigorously developing the propaganda role of reading newspapers at meal times and individual conversations, so the propaganda work was done very well. Next, the branch researched and determined the following systems: 1. The general meeting of propagandists in the whole village shall be held once every two months; the meeting of propagandists in the natural village shall be held once every single month. The main content of the propagandists' meeting is to summarize and exchange propaganda experience, check work, commend the good, criticize the bad, and arrange the propaganda work for the next month. The content of the propagandists' meeting in the natural village is mainly to exchange propaganda experience, discover typical cases, check deviations and problems, and provide them to the propagandists' meeting in the whole village for resolution. 2. The branch's monthly work research meeting must study propaganda work. The branch propaganda committee member should compile simple propaganda materials or mobilization slogans for the resolutions of the branch general meeting (all that can be publicized publicly), and the branch committees distributed in the natural villages are responsible for assigning propaganda to the propagandists. 3. Branch committee members study the thoughts of the masses once a month. The study of propagandists, in addition to listening to the instruction at the instruction station once a month, is mainly carried out in the natural village at ordinary times. Before reading the newspaper, the propagandists must first study it well.

Finally, a general meeting of propagandists in the whole village was convened, summarizing the propaganda work, discussing the branch's opinions on improving the work of the propaganda network in the future, and the propagandists divided the work. For the two propagandists who did not meet the requirements (impure thoughts), in addition to criticizing them, they were also reported to the district committee, and their positions as propagandists were revoked after approval.

    山西武乡郝家垴村整理宣传网的经验
    山西武乡县郝家垴村的宣传网是一九五一年夏季建立的，共有宣传员十八人。在过去的各种工作中，宣传员进行了不少的宣传活动，取得了一定成绩。但是，工作中也存在着不少问题。首先，宣传员还不善于宣传本地的好人好事好经验，而是抄录或背诵报纸上的消息。例如这个村的黑板报上就写着“工厂安全生产计划”、“工人找窍门”、“印度送来一只大象，欢迎参观”等消息，而本村的丰产经验和推广密植的经验，却都不宣传。其次还有歪曲政策胡乱宣传的现象。比如在发动群众组织互助组时说：“不准单干户和互助组变工，不准组员给亲戚干活。”对不愿向银行存款的李小四说：“你破坏工作，完不成任务你负责任。”宣传员中还有些是挂名的，在十八个宣传员中，真正能积极进行宣传工作的只有五人，推推动动的有六人；根本不宣传的有五人。宣传工具也无人管理，黑板报坏了，无人收拾，四个广播筒，变成了叫人的工具。
    所以产生上述现象，主要是：（一）县、区党委放松了对宣传网工作的领导。虽然这个村距县城只有八里路，但是去年一年中，县委、区委就很少派干部到这个村工作。另一方面，又批评这个村落后，在去年的小区评比工作中，连续批评了三次。这样，就有人说：“区委搞的是典型，落后村只是要要材料，问问情况。”（二）宣传传授工作没做好。宣传传授站在九个月的时间内，只传授过五次，传授的时间很长（一天），但是解决问题不多。这样就有三分之一的宣传员不去听传授了。
  （三）支部对建立宣传网的意义还了解不够，也缺乏领导宣传网的经验。宣传网在开始建立时，曾规定过一些制度，但是，慢慢地就不执行了。比如规定要定期研究群众的思想情况，这是一项很重要的工作制度，但因为有些支部委员说：“都是本村人，天天见面，彼此了解，不必研究。”这个制度也就取消了。工作中，对好的不表扬、对坏的也不批评，许多宣传员感到“宣传不宣传，关系不大。”
    工作组根据上述情况，对这个村的宣传网进行了整理：首先通过宣传网和支部委员交谈，和宣传员小型座谈会，了解了宣传网工作的情况，发现了问题，研究了解决问题的方法。接着从三方面着手进行了宣传网的整理工作。
      （一）先组织支部委员学习了中共中央“关于在全党建立对人民群众的宣传网的决定”，从而初步解决了支部委员的“群众落后，工作不好做”和“行政命令不好，但能完成任务”的两个思想问题。支部委员史凤翔说：“党说的很对。回想起过去对敌斗争的时候，群众支持我们把标语贴在敌人的心脏——段村和蟠龙。敌人天天来骚扰，群众终未屈服。群众直接支持了我们的斗争。要说群众落后，那只能怪我们没作好工作。”支部委员史珍玉说： “学习开动了我的脑筋，过去有的工作是表里不一，一级哄一级，成了‘连环套’。比如去年史家垴互助组，名义上组织起四十户，其实只有十户一块干活。强迫命令真把好事办坏了。”这样大家肯定了：不是群众落后，而是工作不深入，只有经过宣传教育，才能把工作做好。强迫命令的作法，必然要遭到群众反对，使政策走了样子，工作也不能做好。
    随着这些思想的解决，大家对区委放松宣传网领导工作的错误态度也提出了批评。工作组耐心听取了大家的意见，并保证转达给区委采纳，同时组织大家学习璩寨支部的领导经验，检查自己的工作。支部委员史凤翔说：“光批评区上也不对，自己的锦标主义和悲观情绪也确实害死人。去年秋天，经过区上批评落后，咱们就在组织互助组工作中犯了强迫命令的错误。”支部宣传委员史珍玉也检讨了自己光说不干，和没有很好管理宣传网的毛病。并说：“过去忽略了领导宣传员学习，只知道没办法了就开会，影响了宣传员的热情，今后应该改变。”最后一致认为：必须加强对群众思想的研究工作。
      （二）通过农业生产互助合作的宣传，提高了宣传员的宣传工作水平，推动了互助组的发展。工作组事先召开了支部委员及宣传员中的积极分子座谈会，会上学习了中共中央“关于春耕生产给各级党委的指示”、中共中央“关于农业生产互助合作的决议”等文件，并着重研究了群众思想和如何进行宣传工作的问题。当时有些群众的思想很混乱，不了解农业发展的前途，许多青年人不安心于农业生产，要到城市、要到工厂去。针对这种情况，深入地宣传了中共中央“关于春耕生产给各级党委的指示”、中共中央“关于农业生产互助合作的决议”等文件和组织起来的好处。经过这样的宣传，大部分群众了解和拥护中共中央“关于农业生产互助合作的决议”，并认为“真政策来了”。但也有些人说：“互助还不如单干，旧社会没人领导也能打粮食。”宣传员把这些情况向支部作了汇报，支部委员作了研究，并给宣传员布置了如何进一步宣传互助合作的好处。按照支部的指示，宣传员分别和群众座谈、拉话，纠正了某些群众对互助合作的错误认识。经过十余天的宣传，史家垴村就有百分之六十五左右的农户参加了互助组。群众生产情绪安定了，高涨了。
    （三）总结检查宣传网工作，定出简单易行的制度。经过整顿互助组的宣传，用事实教育了支部委员和宣传员，证明了宣传工作是可以做好的。在此思想基础上召开了全村支部党员大会，由宣传委员作了宣传网工作总结报告，指出了过去宣传工作上存在着会议多等毛病。同时指出了这次整理宣传网工作中的主要经验是：抓紧了宣传员的学习，注意研究群众思想，耐心说服教育群众，而且大力发挥了饭场读报和个别谈话的宣传作用，所以宣传工作就搞得很好。接着，支部研究确定了以下几个制度：一、全村宣传员大会每逢双月召开一次；自然村宣传员会议逢单月召开一次。宣传员大会的主要内容是总结交流宣传经验，检查工作，表扬好的，批评坏的，布置下月宣传工作。自然村的宣传员会议的内容，主要是交流宣传经验，发现典型，检查偏向与问题，提供全村宣传员大会来解决。二、支部每月一次的工作研究会议，必须研究宣传工作，支部大会的决议（凡能公开宣传的），支部宣传委员应编出简单的宣传材料或鼓动口号，由分布在各自然村的支委负责给宣传员布置宣传。三、支部委员每月研究一次群众思想。宣传员的学习，除每月在传授站听一次传授外，平时主要在自然村进行。凡在读报前，宣传员首先要学好。
    最后，召开了全村宣传员大会，总结了宣传工作，讨论了支部关于今后改进宣传网工作的意见，宣传员进行分工。对两个不够条件的宣传员（思想不纯），除大家对其进行了批评外，同时报告区委，待批准后取消其宣传员的职务。
