    Taking the Socialist Road
    The Hubei Daily published a news item on November 4th entitled "Wuchang Holds Training Class for Mutual Aid Team Leaders" and an article entitled "How Future Education is Conducted in the Wuchang County Mutual Aid Team Leader Training Class." The news and the article indicate that the mutual aid team leader training class is a good place to conduct two-road education for farmers.
    The Wuchang County Committee of the Communist Party of China held the first training class for mutual aid team leaders in late October. In the training class, in addition to solving practical work problems such as consolidating and improving mutual aid organizations and carrying out mutual aid and cooperation movements in conjunction with winter production, the focus was on conducting two-road education for the trainees. A total of seventy-eight mutual aid team leaders participated in the training class. Although most of them were activists in rural areas, their understanding of the purpose and future of mutual aid and cooperation was not clear. Some people knew that they would go to a socialist society in the future, but they did not understand how people in a socialist society produce and live, when they would go to a socialist society, and how to get to a socialist society. There were even various misunderstandings about this, such as the idea that in a socialist society, one only relies on machine production, people do nothing, they just eat and play, play and eat, and they don't have to worry about anything, and adults and children are supplied by the government; the idea that socialism is "returning to the big pile" and "eating from the big pot," etc. In response to the specific ideological situation of the trainees, the training class first used the Soviet Union as an example to specifically explain the real situation of socialist society, explaining that socialist society is about common prosperity for everyone and happiness for everyone; socialism is about each giving according to their ability and distribution according to their work; socialism is about using machines for collective production, and the proceeds of labor are still freely disposed of by oneself. This eliminated everyone's misunderstandings and concerns. Trainee Ai Sichun said: "I used to only know that socialism was about living in multi-story buildings with electric lights and telephones, but I didn't know that we would still be paid according to our work." Trainee Dong Shufa said: "Now I know that we still have to work in a socialist society." But how can we achieve a beautiful socialist society? The training class also guided everyone to discuss and criticize two confused views based on the trainees' ideological situation, namely, the view that it is possible to reach a socialist society without taking the road of mutual aid and cooperation, and the view that agricultural production has no future, and educated everyone to realize that only when farmers across the country work hard to produce and increase grain production, support national industrial construction, and organize themselves to participate in mutual aid and cooperation, can they gradually move towards a socialist society.
    After solving these problems, the issue of the two roads was discussed. The training class inspired the trainees to recall the pain of the old society, recognize the harm and evil consequences of taking the capitalist road of a few people getting rich and the majority of farmers becoming poor and bankrupt, and educated the farmers with their own personal experiences through self-education methods such as comparison and accounting. For example, trainee Wang Cairun said: "The old road is that a few people exploit the majority. We suffered in the past because we were exploited by those few landlords." Trainee Tu Shiyong said: "To be honest, our farmers' families produce individually with very little strength and a very weak foundation. After the land reform, we encountered two years of drought. If we took the old road, I'm afraid we would have sold our wives and children." When conducting two-road education for the trainees, the training class also linked it to the current spontaneous tendencies in rural areas and conducted analysis and criticism, explaining that if certain speculative buying and selling activities, usury activities, land sales, and employment exploitation that are growing in some rural areas are allowed to develop, the peasant masses will be plunged back into a state of exploitation and suffering. After discussion, everyone unanimously agreed that if we do not take the capitalist road and want to take the socialist road, we must do a good job in mutual aid teams, organize credit cooperatives, and develop supply and marketing cooperatives. Trainee Wang Dagen also criticized his mistake of doing cattle trading business.
    In addition to introducing the situation of the Wuchang County Mutual Aid Team Leader Training Class in a prominent position, the Hubei Daily also published a short commentary entitled "Vigorously Conduct Two-Road Education." The short commentary pointed out that the method of conducting two-road education in the Wuchang County Mutual Aid Team Leader Training Class is worth promoting. Only by conducting two-road education for farmers earnestly and repeatedly based on their specific ideological situation can we better stimulate farmers' enthusiasm for production and attract farmers to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation, so as to gradually complete the socialist transformation of agriculture by the state.

    走社会主义的路
    十一月四日湖北日报刊登了“武昌举办互助组长训练班”的消息和“武昌县互助组长训练班中是如何进行前途教育的”的文章。消息和文章表明，互助组长训练班是向农民进行两条道路教育的良好场所。
    中共武昌县委曾于十月下旬举办第一期互助组长训练班。在训练班中，除解决巩固提高互助组织和结合冬季生产开展互助合作运动等实际工作问题外，着重向学员进行了两条道路的教育。参加训练班的共有七十八名互助组长。他们虽然大都是农村中的积极分子，但对互助合作的目的和前途的认识并不明确。有人虽然知道将来是要到社会主义社会，但弄不清社会主义社会中的人们是怎样生产和生活的，什么时候才到社会主义社会，以及怎样走到社会主义社会。对此甚至有各种误解，如认为在社会主义社会中，光靠机器生产，人不做事，只是吃了玩，玩了吃，百事不操心，大人小孩都是政府供给；认为社会主义就是“归大堆”、“吃大锅饭”等。针对学员们的具体思想情况，训练班首先以苏联为例，具体讲解了社会主义社会的真实情况，说明社会主义社会是要大家共同富裕，人人幸福；社会主义是各尽所能，按劳取酬；社会主义是使用机器集体生产，劳动所得仍由自己自由支配。这就消除了大家的误解和顾虑。学员艾思春说：“以前只晓得社会主义是楼上楼下，电灯电话，那里晓得还要按劳取酬。”学员董书发说：“现在才晓得社会主义社会中也要劳动。”但是怎样才能达到美好的社会主义社会？训练班也根据学员们的思想情况，引导大家讨论和批判了两种糊涂观点，即认为不走互助合作道路也可以到社会主义社会和认为农业生产无前途的观点，教育大家认识只有全国农民努力生产，增产粮食，支援国家工业建设，同时组织起来，参加互助合作，才能逐步走到社会主义社会。
    在解决这些问题后，又讨论了两条道路的问题。训练班启发学员们回忆旧社会的痛苦，认清走少数人发财、大多数农民穷困破产的资本主义道路的危害和恶果，通过对比、算账等自我教育的方法，以农民的切身体验教育了农民。如学员王才润说：“旧道路就是少数人剥削多数人，我们过去受苦遭孽，还不是那些少数地主剥削穷的。”学员涂师勇说：“说句老实话，我们农民一家一户的生产，力量很小，底子很薄，土地改革后碰到两年旱灾，要是走旧道路，怕连自己的老婆孩子也卖光了。”训练班在向学员进行两条道路的教育时，并联系到当前农村中的自发倾向，进行了分析批判；说明某些农村中正在滋长的投机买卖活动、高利贷活动、土地买卖、雇工剥削的情况，如听其发展，就会使农民群众重新陷入被剥削、受痛苦的境地。经过讨论，大家一致认为不走资本主义的路要走社会主义的路就必须搞好互助组，组织信用合作社，发展供销合作社。学员王大根并批判了自己做贩牛生意的错误。
    湖北日报除以显著地位介绍了武昌县举办互助组长训练班的情况外，并发表了“大力进行两条道路的教育”的短评。短评指出，武昌县在这次互助组长训练班中进行两条道路教育的方法是值得推广的。只有根据农民的具体思想情况认真地反复地向农民进行两条道路的教育，才能更好地激发农民的生产积极性，吸引农民走互助合作的道路，以逐步完成国家对农业的社会主义改造。
