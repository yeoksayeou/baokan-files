    Local Cultural and Educational Departments Should Do a Good Job in Streamlining and Saving

    Editor's Note: Recently, we have received many letters from readers reflecting that some cadres in cultural and educational departments still have a wrong view of streamlining and saving work, believing that cultural and educational departments are "money-spending organs"; believing that cultural and educational departments are "poor departments" and "cannot be saved"; believing that cultural and educational departments can only save "bits and pieces," which is of no help to the accumulation of funds for national industrialization. These understandings show that these comrades do not yet understand that the funds for national industrialization must be saved from all aspects, even a very small amount of wealth. Drops of water form a stream, and grains of sand form a tower. If all cultural and educational departments in the country can pay attention to saving, then the total amount accumulated will be very large. Judging from the several letters published today, the phenomenon of waste in some cultural and educational departments is still quite serious. It is hoped that the leading organs of cultural and educational departments in various places will attach great importance to streamlining and saving work, strengthen ideological education for cadres, and check and correct wasteful phenomena such as violations of financial systems and unreasonable use of funds, so that cultural and educational funds can be used where they are most needed.

    An Guang, Zhan Yu, Bei An and other counties have phenomena of misusing illiteracy eradication funds

    Cong Zhiyu of the Finance Supervision Office of the Finance Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government wrote: The Finance Supervision Office of the Finance Department, the Finance Section of the Education Department, and the Illiteracy Eradication Office of the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government organized a joint inspection team, which successively inspected the use of illiteracy eradication funds in the fourth quarter of last year and the first and second quarters of this year in An Guang, Zhan Yu, Bei An, and Sui Hua counties from late August to mid-September. During the inspection, it was found that the illiteracy eradication agencies in An Guang, Zhan Yu, and Bei An counties all had violations of financial systems and unreasonable expenditures; Sui Hua County had a better situation because the leadership attached more importance to it, but there were also wasteful phenomena in the expenditures of individual projects.

    An Guang, Zhan Yu, Bei An and other three counties falsely reported more than 38 million yuan in final accounts. For example, Zhan Yu reimbursed the wage subsidies that were not turned over to the trade union at the end of last year; and deposited a portion of the publicity fees into Xinhua Bookstore, and reported it to the higher authorities with a temporary receipt first, but this amount has not been used up by August this year. The above-mentioned three counties also have serious cases of loose financial procedures and arbitrary misappropriation of funds. When compiling the final accounts, the staff member and accountant of the Bei An Illiteracy Eradication Office arbitrarily filled in various subjects and fabricated expenditures, and all the receipts and IOUs were not approved by the director. The director of the county's Illiteracy Eradication Office arbitrarily approved notes to lend more than 5 million yuan of illiteracy eradication funds to other units for long-term use, which has not been repaid so far.

    Unreasonable expenditures and extravagance and waste are common in the four counties. For example, An Guang, Bei An, and Zhan Yu counties spent more than 5.3 million yuan on watching movies, taking pictures, buying sweets, cigarettes, and holding banquets when training part-time teachers. Zhan Yu County used nearly 1 million yuan of publicity funds to make stage curtains. The counties also used huge amounts of funds to buy books that are not suitable for promoting rapid literacy. For example, the An Guang County Illiteracy Eradication Office bought Das Kapital, Historical Materialism, A General History of China, Accounting Tutorials, Psychology, The Storm, etc., spending 75% of the book purchase funds. Sui Hua County purchased books such as On Mass Philosophy, Pushkin, Soviet Geography, University Students, and Methodology, spending 88% of the book purchase funds.

    The above situation not only makes it impossible for state funds to be used reasonably, but also affects the development of illiteracy eradication work. It is recommended that the finance departments and education administrative departments in various places pay attention to checking the use of illiteracy eradication funds to prevent the recurrence of the above-mentioned phenomena.

    Liuzhou Agricultural School should not allow the farm to be abandoned

    Reader Shi Shunqing wrote: The farm of Liuzhou Agricultural School in Guangxi has more than ten acres of land. Since October last year, the school has allowed these lands to be abandoned. Among them, there is one acre of land, on which the school mobilized students to plant sesame seeds last year, and also applied a lot of fertilizer. The sesame seeds matured, but the school did not collect them. After repeated urging by the students, when the school decided to mobilize the students to collect them, the sesame seeds had matured and cracked and fallen off, and as a result, not a single sesame seed was harvested from one acre of land. This year, the school hired people to cultivate about one acre of land, but nothing was planted, and it looks like this acre of land is again full of weeds. The People's Government calls for not abandoning a single piece of land, and not wasting a single grain of food, but our school allows more than ten acres of land to grow weeds, and allows all the mature sesame seeds to be lost. The students have raised opinions to the school, and the local farmers are also very dissatisfied with the school's abandonment of farmland, but the school still believes that there is nothing wrong with abandoning these lands.

    Extravagance and waste were serious at the former Hunan University

    Li Jieren of the former Political and Legal Department of Hunan University wrote: Our school has now been changed to Central China Institute of Technology, Central South Institute of Civil Engineering and Architecture, and Hunan Normal College. Before the adjustment of departments, our school had a lot of extravagance and waste. For example, the science museum only needed to replace the roof on the third floor, but the school authorities wasted more than 14 tons of cement, and more than 1,400 stonemasons and masons, and used cement to wash and seal the building all around. For example, the school already had enough sports fields, but the school authorities decided to open up a large playground of more than 40 acres of land (which can harvest more than 300 dan of grain every year) in order to show off. It cost nearly 400 million yuan and wasted more than ten tons of cement. Later, due to lack of funds, only half of it was completed and the work was stopped halfway. Now, very few students go there to exercise. The school has more than 3,000 old desks, which could have been used with a little repair. However, in order to pursue "beauty," the school decided to paint them all; as a result, nearly 1,000 desks were painted, costing more than 30 million yuan. There are 50,000 to 60,000 red bricks piled up in the orange garden on the campus. They have been exposed to the sun and rain for several years, and many have been damaged, and no one cares about them; however, when the school repairs toilets and walls, it spends money to buy new bricks.

    The school leaders also do not educate the students enough on saving state property, and sometimes they take a conciliatory attitude towards the unreasonable demands of a few students. For example, some students requested to travel to Nanyue during the summer vacation this year, and the school accepted this request, resulting in the spending of 40 to 50 million yuan. Later, some people said: Our production welfare funds have a surplus of more than 300 million yuan, and we should have a dinner party. The school killed pigs and slaughtered cattle, decorated with lanterns and colored streamers, and wasted another 50 to 60 million yuan. For another example, a few students in the lung disease dormitory suggested that the school build a shed and a stove to boil sputum pots. At that time, the workers suggested: The sputum pots have been disinfected with medicine, so there is no need to build this stove. However, this opinion did not work, and the school still spent more than 1 million yuan to build a shed and a stove. But as a result, no one went to boil sputum pots at all, and now there are many weeds growing in the shed and on the stove.

### 各地文教部门应该做好精简节约工作

专栏：读者来信摘要

    各地文教部门应该做好精简节约工作
    编者按：最近我们收到许多读者来信，反映有些文教部门的干部对精简节约工作还有着一种错误的看法，认为文教部门就是“用钱的机关”；认为文教部门是“清水衙门”，“无可节约”；认为文教部门可以节约的只是“点点滴滴”，对国家工业化的积累资金无济于事。这些认识说明了这些同志还不了解：国家工业化的资金，是要从各方面来注意节约每一点即使是很微小的财富。滴水成流，聚沙成塔，如果全国文教部门都能注意节约，那末，积累起来的总数将是很大的。从今天选登的几封来信看来，某些文教部门的浪费现象还是相当严重的。希望各地文教部门的领导机关切实重视精简节约工作，加强对干部的思想教育，并检查和纠正违反财政制度、不合理使用经费等浪费现象，把文教经费用到最需要的地方去。
    安广、瞻榆、北安等县有乱用扫除文盲经费的现象
    黑龙江省人民政府财政厅财政监察室丛致宇来信：黑龙江省人民政府财政厅财政监察室、教育厅财务科和扫除文盲办公室曾组织联合检查组，在八月下旬至九月中旬先后检查了安广、瞻榆、北安、绥化等四县去年第四季度和今年一、二季度扫除文盲经费的使用情况。在检查中发现安广、瞻榆、北安三县扫除文盲机构都有违犯财务制度和开支不合理的现象；绥化县因为领导方面比较重视，情况较好，但个别项目的开支也有浪费现象。
    安广、瞻榆、北安等三县假报决算三千八百多万元。如瞻榆在去年年底将没有上缴工会的工资补助费报销了；并把一部分宣传费存入新华书店，拿一张临时单据先向上级报销，但这笔款项到今年八月还没有用完。上述三县财务手续制度不严格而随便挪用资金的情况也很严重。北安扫除文盲办公室科员与会计在编造决算时，任意填写各项科目，假造开支，而所有的单据、借据又都未经主任批准过。该县扫除文盲办公室主任擅自批条子把扫除文盲经费五百多万元借给别的单位长期使用，至今未还。
    开支不合理和铺张浪费的情况在四县普遍存在。如安广、北安、瞻榆三县在训练兼职教师时，看电影、照像、买糖果、烟卷以及会餐等就花了五百三十多万元。瞻榆县拿将近一百万的宣传费来做剧幕。各县还用巨额经费买些不适用于推行速成识字用的书籍。如安广县扫除文盲办公室买了资本论、历史唯物论、中国通史、会计教程、心理学、暴风雨等，用掉购书款项的百分之七十五。绥化县购置论群众哲学、普式庚、苏联地理、大学生、思想方法论等书籍，用掉购书款项的百分之八十八。
    上述情况，不但使国家资金不能得到合理使用，还影响了扫除文盲工作的开展。建议各地财政部门和教育行政部门，注意检查扫除文盲经费的使用情况，防止上述现象的重复发生。
    柳州农业学校不应该任凭农场荒废
    读者石顺清来信：广西柳州农业学校的农场有十多亩地。去年十月以来，学校就任凭这些土地荒废着。其中有一亩地，去年学校发动同学种上了芝麻，还下了很多肥。芝麻成熟了，但学校也不去收。经同学多次催促，到学校决定发动同学去收时，芝麻都已成熟裂开而落掉了，结果一亩地的芝麻一粒也没收到。今年学校请人耕了约一亩地，结果什么东西也没有种，眼看这亩地上又长满了杂草。人民政府号召不丢荒一块土地，不浪费一粒粮食，而我们学校却听任十多亩地生杂草，听任成熟的芝麻全部受损失。同学们曾向学校提出意见，当地农民对学校荒废农场田地也很不满意，但学校却还认为荒废这些土地没有什么关系。
    前湖南大学铺张浪费严重
    前湖南大学政治法律系李杰人来信：我校现已改为华中工学院、中南土建学院和湖南师范专科学院。在院系调整以前，我校有着很多铺张浪费的情况。譬如，科学馆的房子本来只是三楼需要换个屋顶，但学校当局却浪费十四吨多水泥，一千四百多石工、泥工，把这栋房子四周用水泥弥洗做缝。又如学校里已经有了足够的运动场，但校方为了铺张门面，又决定新辟一块四十多亩田（每年可收割谷子三百多石）的大操坪。化了将近四亿元，浪费了十几吨水泥，后来因为缺乏资金只完成了一半就中途停工了。现在也很少有同学到那里去运动。学校有三千多张旧课桌，本来只要略加修补就可以使用。但校方为了追求“好看”，就决定普遍上漆；结果漆了将近一千张课桌，就化了人民币三千多万元。校内橘园里堆着五、六万块红砖，几年来任凭日晒夜露，风吹雨打，损坏了不少，也无人过问；但学校里修厕所、补墙头时，却又花钱另买新砖。
    学校领导方面对同学们进行节约国家财产的教育也是很不够的，有时对少数同学的不合理要求也采取迁就态度。譬如今年暑期有部分同学要求旅行南岳，校方就接受了这一要求，结果花了四、五千万元。后来又有人说：我们的生产福利费有三亿多元的盈余，要进行一次聚餐。校方就杀猪宰牛、张灯结彩，又浪费了五、六千万元。再如，肺病宿舍有少数同学建议校方搭个棚、打个灶来煮痰盂。当时工人同志提出：痰盂既用药水消了毒，不必打这个灶。但这个意见不起作用，校方还是花了一百多万元去搭棚打灶。但结果，根本没有人去煮痰盂，现在棚里、灶上都已长着很多的野草。
