The Right of Prisoners of War to Hear Explanations Must Not Be Deprived
By our reporter Hu Jin

Our side's explanation work, which resumed on the 21st for three days, has been forced to stop again. According to Washington's timetable for forcibly detaining prisoners of war, the deadline for explaining to prisoners of war was to expire on December 23rd, and their future criminal task is to step up preparations to abduct the more than 20,000 of our captured personnel under the supervision of the Indian forces.

Washington and the U.S. military headquarters in Tokyo have brazenly and deliberately distorted the provisions of the Korean Armistice Agreement regarding the repatriation of prisoners of war, attempting to justify their barbaric and illegal act of depriving prisoners of war of their right to hear explanations. The Armistice Agreement is by no means a fig leaf for the Washington-Seoul-Taiwan criminal group's forced detention of prisoners of war. The "Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" stipulates that prisoners of war have the right to hear 90 days of explanations, and in the past 90 days, our side has only conducted 10 days of explanation work. This is an iron fact that the US side cannot cover up no matter what.

The U.S. side instructed special agents to interrupt our explanation work five times, with the fifth interruption lasting 34 days. When the so-called explanation period had only three days left, they suddenly accepted our explanation to the prisoners of war in camps 3 and 4 in order to cover up the illegal acts of the U.S. side in instructing them to obstruct our explanation work five times and depriving our captured personnel of their right to hear 90 days of explanations. According to returnees Ren Guangyu (teacher at the "CIE School" in Camp 3) and Liu Zhizhong ("correspondent" in the battalion headquarters of Camp 3), who were repatriated after receiving explanations, the special agent leaders in Camp 3, "CIE School" "Principal" Dong Zhongqian and "Deputy Battalion Commander" Ding Zhengxing, requested the Indian forces to convene a meeting of special agent leaders from various camps of the First Regiment when they received the explanation notice on the 20th. Dong Zhongqian returned to the camp after the meeting and said: "Wang Shunqing (i.e., 'Regimental Commander' of the First Regiment) has instructed that we should go to listen to the explanations because there are only three days left in the explanation period. We should deal with these few days so that the Communist Party will have nothing to say." He also said: "This is an emergency period. If we get through these three days, more than 20,000 prisoners of war will never have to listen to explanations again. Just wait for the order to break out of the camp."

However, the US attempt to deceive world public opinion and make people unable to see the true situation of how the 90-day explanation time was deprived in the past is futile. It is obviously unreasonable for the U.S. side to count the 20 days it deliberately delayed the construction of the explanation camp and postponed the start date of the explanation work as the time our side conducted explanation work; even after our explanation work began, the U.S. side instructed Li Jiang special agents to interrupt the explanation work five times, so that our side only conducted ten days of explanation for about one-seventh of our captured personnel, and it can definitely not be said that the right of our captured personnel to hear explanations has not been wantonly deprived.

On the contrary, the resumption of our explanation work for these three days will only further expose the U.S. side's untrustworthy behavior to the people of the world, and prove that it should be the unshirkable responsibility of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Force to safeguard the "Scope of Authority."

The explanation to the prisoners of war in Camp No. 3 was conducted according to the explanation plan and isolation method proposed by our side, that is, our side would explain to about 250 prisoners of war out of about 500 prisoners of war in one camp each day, and then the prisoners of war who had heard the explanation would be isolated and guarded by the Indian forces. As everyone knows, the long-term interruption of the explanation work since November 17th was due to the fact that the U.S. side instructed Li Jiang special agents to sabotage the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visitation Work" and refused to isolate the prisoners of war who had been explained and those who had not been explained, because they believed that this would disperse the special agent organization and weaken control over the prisoners of war. Although the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission agreed to arrange isolation facilities, it delayed in fulfilling its promise due to the so-called "prisoner of war representatives," who were actually US special agents, opposing isolation and bringing 250 prisoners of war out to listen to explanations every day, believing that if isolation was implemented, it would be necessary to "use force," which might cause a "bloody" incident.

Therefore, the US side must bear the main responsibility for the long-term interruption of the explanation work; and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian forces should also bear certain responsibility for failing to break the US special agent organization and its obstruction and sabotage activities in accordance with the "Scope of Authority" and "Working Rules" to ensure the smooth progress of our explanation work. Therefore, there is absolutely no reason to count the more than one month consumed by the fifth long-term suspension of our explanation work as our side's actual explanation time.

In order to cover up its unreasonable long-term interruption of the explanation work and deprive our captured personnel of their right to hear 90 days of explanations, the U.S. side has fabricated a lot of lies, such as our captured personnel "refusing to listen to explanations" and "refusing repatriation." However, in these three days of explanation work, even though our captured personnel were subjected to the terrorist threats and strict control of the U.S. side and its special agents inside and outside the explanation camp, the fact that 67 people boldly applied for repatriation once again thoroughly exposed this shameful lie of the U.S. side.

The prisoners of war in camps 3 and 4 have long suffered the bloody persecution and deception of the US-Chiang special agents. Before this explanation, the special agent leaders forced the prisoners of war to sign their names and write letters to various "free world" countries, expressing their determination to "return to Taiwan." The special agents also threatened the prisoners of war, saying: "You have tattooed words and written letters of determination. If you go back, the Communist Party will kill you." When listening to the explanation, the special agent leaders personally directed and intimidated the prisoners of war, and inserted a large number of special agents and so-called "resolute elements" into the prisoners of war to monitor them. When 250 prisoners of war in Camp 4 listened to the explanation on the 23rd, "Deputy Battalion Commander" Zhao Xingchang believed that it was the "last day" to listen to the explanation and was not afraid of isolation, so he and two company commanders personally led the "core" force (30 members drawn from the 50 members of the "Guard Team," 16 members drawn from the 19 "squad leaders" and "deputy squad leaders," all "CIE" teachers, and more than 60 squad leaders and deputy squad leaders), and the members selected from each squad, to make a lot of noise in the explanation tent, attempting to turn the explanation work into a farce. At the same time, a large number of Taiwan "teachers" whose hands were stained with the blood of our captured personnel, including "Teacher Ma" from the "hospital," illegally entered the explanation camp in the name of so-called "observer representatives" of the United Nations forces, "representatives of the detaining party," and "translators," suppressing the prisoners of war from applying for repatriation, making the explanation camp filled with a terrifying atmosphere.

However, among the 67 returnees who applied for repatriation, when they entered the explanation tent and dispelled their fears, many of them immediately accused the U.S. side of forcibly detaining prisoners of war. Returnees Liu Zhizhong and Song Guichen had been looking forward to returning to their country. When they heard the news of the explanation, they were happy and thought: "The day to stand out has come." Before they even entered the explanation tent, they angrily tore off the badges, chest badges, and armbands of the Taiwan Chiang bandits, trampled them under their feet, walked to the explanation representative with tears streaming down their faces, shouted slogans of "Long live Chairman Mao" and "Down with U.S. imperialism," and walked out of the door to apply for repatriation. Returnee Wang Shan had deep doubts because he had been persecuted and deceived for a long time. Just as he was about to enter the explanation tent, he ran into a special agent walking out of the door without applying for repatriation, threatening him: "Don't go through the back door (i.e., the door to apply for repatriation). Director Dong (i.e., special agent leader Dong Zhongqian) is guarding there with a knife." As soon as he entered the explanation tent, the United Nations army "observer representative" Taiwan "teacher" who often conveyed orders to Dong Zhongqian stared at him fiercely. He immediately remembered the situation during the US illegal "screening" in the past, and felt terrified. But he was determined to listen to the words of the explanation representative. When the representative said that they did not have to worry about being forced to tattoo words, and that the people of the motherland welcomed them back to the country, he could not stop crying. Then he asked the representative if there were special agents at the door when he went back. The representative told him that it was absolutely safe, so he loudly said that he wanted to return to the motherland, and angrily accused: "U.S. imperialism has oppressed me so bitterly, I want to take revenge."

These countless facts full of blood and tears powerfully prove that our captured personnel all yearn to go home and live a peaceful life, and as long as they are given full right to hear explanations, they will boldly apply for repatriation. Therefore, the U.S. side's interruption of the bilateral talks, sabotaging the convening of the political conference, and now depriving our captured personnel of their right to hear 90 days of explanations in order to achieve the purpose of forcibly detaining prisoners of war is absolutely intolerable. This extremely serious situation cannot but arouse the close attention of the people of the world.

    战俘听解释的权利不容剥夺
    本报记者  胡今
    我方解释工作于二十一日起恢复进行了三天后，又被迫停顿了。按照华盛顿规定的强迫扣留战俘的时间表，战俘解释期限要在十二月二十三日截止，他们今后的罪恶任务就是加紧准备劫夺在印度部队看管下的两万多名我方被俘人员。
    华盛顿和东京的美军总部厚颜无耻地有意曲解朝鲜停战协定关于遣返战俘的规定，妄图替其横暴地剥夺战俘听解释权利的非法行为作辩护。停战协定决不是华盛顿—汉城—台湾罪恶集团强迫扣留战俘的一块遮羞布。“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”规定战俘享有听取九十天解释的权利，而在过去的九十天中，我方仅进行了十天的解释工作，这是美方无论如何也掩盖不了的铁的事实。
    美方指使特务五次打断我方解释工作，第五次竟中断三十四天。到了它们所谓的解释期限仅剩最后三天的时候，突然接受我方对三号及四号营场战俘进行解释，是为了借此掩饰美方指使他们五次阻断我方解释工作、剥夺我方被俘人员听取九十天解释权利的非法勾当。据解释后遣返的归来人员任光瑜（三号营场“CIE学校”教员）和刘志忠（三号营场大队部“通讯员”）揭露：三号营场特务头子
  “CIE学校”“校长”董仲谦和“大队副”丁正兴，在二十日接到解释通知时向印度部队要求召集第一联队各营场特务头子开会，董仲谦开会后回到营场说：“王顺清（即一联队“联队长”）有指示，我们要去听解释，因为解释期限仅剩三天，我们应付这几天后，共产党才没有话讲。”又说：“这是紧急时期，混过了三天，两万多战俘将永远不要再听解释，只要等到命令就突营。”
    然而，美方企图借此欺蒙世界舆论，使人们看不见过去九十天解释时间是怎样被剥夺的真实情况，是徒劳的。美方把它故意拖延修建解释营场，推迟解释工作开始日期的二十天，算作是我方进行了解释工作的时间，显然是毫无道理的；就在我方解释工作开始后，美方指使李蒋特务五次阻断解释工作，使我方仅对约占总数七分之一的我方被俘人员进行了十天的解释，也绝对不能说我方被俘人员听取解释权利没有横被剥夺。
    刚刚相反，这三天我方解释工作的恢复进行，只有进一步使美方这一毫无信义的行为彻底暴露在世界人民的面前，并证明维护“职权范围”应是中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队不可推卸的职责。
    第三号营场战俘听取解释，是根据我方提出的解释计划和隔离方法进行的，即由我方一天对一个营场约五百名战俘中的二百五十名战俘进行解释，然后已听解释的战俘由印度部队加以隔离看管。大家知道，自十一月十七日起解释工作所以长期中断，就是由于美方指使李蒋特务破坏“解释和访问工作细则”，拒绝隔离已经解释与未经解释的战俘，因为他们认为这样就会分散特务组织，削弱对战俘的控制。中立国遣返委员会虽然答应安排隔离设备，但又以所谓“战俘代表”实即美方特务反对隔离和每天带出二百五十名战俘听解释，而迟迟未能实践诺言，认为如果要实行隔离就必须“使用武力”，可能造成“流血”事件。
    因此，美方必须负担解释工作长期中断的主要责任；而中立国遣返委员会和印度部队未能根据
  “职权范围”和“工作细则”，打破美方特务组织及其阻挠破坏活动，以保证我方解释工作的顺利进行，也应负有一定的责任。所以，由此造成我方解释工作第五次长期停顿所消耗的一个多月的时间，也是绝对没有理由算作我方的实际解释时间的。
    美方为了掩饰其无理长期打断解释工作，以剥夺我方被俘人员应听取九十天解释的权利的罪行，大肆捏造所谓我方被俘人员“拒绝听解释”、“拒绝遣返”的漫天谎言。但是，在这三天的解释工作中，我方被俘人员即使受到美方及其特务在解释营场内外的恐怖威胁与严厉控制，仍有六十七名大胆申请遣返的事实，就又一次彻底地揭穿了美方这一可耻的谎言。
    三号和四号营场战俘，曾长期地遭受了美蒋特务的血腥迫害和蒙蔽欺骗。这次听解释前，特务头子又强迫战俘签名和向“自由世界”各国写信，表示“回台湾”的决心，特务并威胁战俘说：“你们已刺了字，写了决心书，回去共产党杀你的头。”在听解释时，特务头子亲自指挥和威吓战俘，并在战俘中插入大批特务和所谓“坚决分子”进行监视。四号营场二百五十名战俘在二十三日听解释时，
  “大队副”赵兴昌认为是“最后一天”听解释，不怕隔离，就和两个中队长亲自率领“核心”力量
  （五十名“警备队”员中抽出三十名，十九名“小队长”“副小队长”中抽出十六名，全部“CIE”教员和六十多名班长副班长），和从各小队中挑选的队员，到解释帐篷大吵大闹，企图使解释工作成为滑稽剧。同时，大批双手染满我方被俘人员鲜血的台湾“老师”，包括“医院”的“马老师”在内，又以所谓联军“观察代表”、“拘留一方代表”和“翻译”的名义，非法混入解释营场，压制战俘不得申请遣返，使解释营场内外弥漫着一片恐怖气氛。
    但是，申请遣返的六十七名归来人员中，当他们进入解释帐篷解除了疑惧时，很多人当场控诉了美方强迫扣留战俘的罪行。归来人员刘志忠和宋贵臣，一直渴望回国，听到解释消息时，心里高兴地想：“这回出头的日子到了。”他们还没有进入解释帐篷，就愤怒撕下台湾蒋匪帽徽和胸章、臂章，把它踩在脚下，走到解释代表面前热泪双流，高呼“毛主席万岁”“打倒美帝国主义”口号走出申请遣返的门。归来人员王山因受长期迫害欺骗，心存深重疑虑，刚要进入解释帐篷就又碰到一个特务走出未申请遣返的门，威吓他说：“不要走后门（即申请遣返的门），董‘主任’（即特务头子董仲谦）拿刀在那里把守着。”他一进解释帐篷，常常给董仲谦传达命令的联合国军“观察代表”台湾“老师”就狠狠地盯住他。他立即想起过去在美方非法“甄别”时的情况，浑身感到恐怖。但他一心要听解释代表的话。当代表说到被迫刺字不必顾虑，祖国人民欢迎他们回国时，他流泪不止。然后问代表回去时门口有没有特务，代表告诉他绝对安全，他就大声说我要回祖国，并愤恨地控诉：“美帝国主义压迫得我好苦，我要报仇。”
    这无数充满血泪的事实，有力地证明了我方被俘人员都是渴望回家过和平生活的，只要他们得到充分听取解释的权利，都会大胆申请遣返。因此，美方中断了双方会谈，破坏政治会议的召开，现在又剥夺我方被俘人员听取九十天解释的权利，以达到强迫扣留战俘的目的，是决不能容忍的。这
  一极端严重的局势不能不引起世界人民的密切注视。
