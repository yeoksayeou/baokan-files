State-owned commercial departments and cooperatives in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Guangzhou and other places are actively preparing large quantities of New Year goods to ensure the supply of materials for the New Year and Spring Festival.

In order to ensure the supply of non-staple foods for the New Year and Spring Festival, the China Native Produce Company and the China Food Export Company jointly convened a non-staple food supply meeting for the New Year and Spring Festival, and signed material supply contracts at the meeting. According to the supply pattern of materials in previous years, the continuous increase in population and the increase in purchasing power of suburban farmers after selling grain this year, all state-owned trading companies and cooperatives in Beijing began preparations for the supply of New Year goods in November. Under the unified leadership of the non-staple food working group of the Beijing Municipal Retail Supply Office, various state-owned trading companies and cooperatives formulated supply plans and dispatched additional staff to various places for procurement. Shenyang City held a New Year goods supply meeting with the participation of state-owned commercial enterprises, the Municipal Cooperative General Society, the Administration for Industry and Commerce and other units, and formulated a supply plan based on the actual situation. In early December, state-owned commercial departments and cooperatives in Guangzhou established a New Year and Spring Festival material supply working group to prepare for the supply of non-staple foods for the festival. The Shanghai Native Produce Company's retail department began organizing sources of non-staple foods from various local native produce companies and cooperatives two months ago.

With the improvement of people's living standards, the demand for non-staple foods has increased. This year, Beijing plans to increase the supply of pork for citizens' New Year consumption by about 65% compared with the same period last year; the Shanghai Municipal Cooperative Federation plans to increase the supply of cured meat by 80% compared with the actual sales volume last year, dried bamboo shoots by 96%, and vermicelli by 41%; Guangzhou plans to increase the supply of live pigs by 33%, chickens, ducks and geese by 36%, and eggs by 22%. The main non-staple food plans in other regions have also been increased.

Currently, state-owned commercial departments and cooperatives in the above-mentioned regions are purchasing large quantities of New Year goods from various places. The Beijing Native Produce Company and cooperatives have transported large quantities of cattle and sheep from Inner Mongolia, Baotou and Suiyuan. The Municipal Cooperative and Retail Company purchased hundreds of thousands of kilograms of eggs, and transported large quantities of cured meat and dried meat from Chongqing, Hankou and other places. The Municipal Native Produce Company also prepared fresh fish and ice fish for citizens. State-owned trading companies and cooperatives in Beijing also prepared nearly one million kilograms of fruit. The Beijing Department Store Company also prepared various daily necessities and a large number of sweets and pastries. The Shanghai Native Produce Company's retail department has transported a large number of non-staple foods from various places. There is plenty of sugar, black fungus, Hunan lotus seeds, dried shrimps, scallops, preserved meat, sausages, dried lychees, longans, and apples. The Shanghai Department Store Company has prepared a large number of sweets and pastries, and children's toys have also begun to be widely supplied. The Shenyang Native Produce Company has now transported a large amount of non-staple foods, including a large amount of pork, beef, eggs, vermicelli, Chinese cabbage, chicken, fish, fruits and vegetables, dried vegetables, and seafood. In addition to organizing fabrics, clothing, daily necessities and New Year paintings, the Shenyang Department Store Wholesale Station and the Municipal Department Store Company have also purchased a large amount of granulated sugar and brown sugar from various places. The tea alone amounts to more than 300,000 kilograms. In addition to actively transferring raw oil from the producing areas, the Guangzhou branch of the China Oils and Fats Company also transferred a large amount of sesame seeds and peanuts to Guangzhou for entrusted processing to expand the supply. In addition to actively organizing the supply of flour and soybeans, the Guangzhou branch of the China Grain Company also processed glutinous rice flour and transferred a batch of glutinous rice flour to state-owned retail stores for sale, directly supplying consumers.

Most of the large quantities of New Year goods organized in various places have been put on the shelves of the retail departments to facilitate customers' selection, some have been stored in warehouses, and some are still being transferred.

    为了保证做好新年和春节的副食品供应工作，中国土产公司和中国食品出口公司曾联合召开了新年、春节的副食品供应会议，会上签订了物资供应合同。北京市各国营贸易公司和合作社根据往年年节物资供应的规律、人口不断增加和今年郊区农民在出卖粮食后购买力增长等情况，在十一月份就开始了年货供应的准备工作。各国营贸易公司和合作社在北京市零售供应办公室副食品工作组的统一领导下，分别订出供应计划，增派工作人员分赴各地采购。沈阳市召开了有国营商业、市合作总社、工商管理局等单位参加的年货供应会议，根据实际情况，制订了供应计划。广州市国营商业部门和合作社在十二月初成立新年、春节物资供应工作组，进行准备节日的副食品供应工作。上海市土产公司门市部早在两个月前就分向各地土产公司和合作社组织副食品的货源。
