Cheng Ximeng Says:
　　The Motherland's Future is Infinitely Bright
　　Taiwan's Military and Government Personnel Should Change Their Plans and Return to the Motherland
    I feel immensely honored and infinitely excited to participate in this CPPCC (Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference) meeting. Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference, and the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Chen Yun, and Vice Premier Li Fuchun at the CPPCC meeting gave me tremendous inspiration and encouragement. I express my complete agreement and heartfelt support.
    Now I would like to say a few personal experiences and opinions, and ask the assembly for correction.
      (1) Ideological remolding plays a significant role in the great development of our country's socialist cause, and it is necessary to continue to actively promote it. Our ideological remolding is entirely a people's internal, voluntary self-education process: through work exercises, social practice and observation, as well as political theory learning, we remold our bad habits and bad ideas from the old society, establish a revolutionary outlook on life, stand on the position of the working people, learn to use the scientific ideological method of dialectical materialism, comprehensively and objectively consider problems, improve ourselves, and improve our work. Such ideological remolding is also for the benefit of the people, starting from the desire for unity, and through criticism and self-criticism, to achieve unity on a new basis, to achieve the purpose of treating illnesses and saving people, and transforming negative factors into positive factors. In a backward and poor large country, the reason why our socialist construction and socialist transformation have achieved decisive victory in just a few years after liberation is inseparable from the achievements of our self-education and self-transformation work under the leadership and care of the Party and the government.
    I am an old intellectual and also a former diplomat. After returning to the embrace of the motherland from the United States in 1950, I conducted self-education in work and study, and only then did I understand the laws of social development, truly appreciate the greatness of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and accept the truth of Marxism-Leninism. I deeply hate the sins of serving the ruling class and harming the interests of the people before liberation. Ideologically distinguishing between ourselves and the enemy, I was spiritually liberated and worked with a hundred times the courage, feeling incomparably excited and supremely happy to be able to contribute all my strength to the motherland's great socialist construction.
    One of the characteristics of our ideological remolding work is to carry out learning in accordance with the principle of consciousness and voluntariness. Since the Party clearly put forward the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom in literature and art and a hundred schools of thought contend in academics, the atmosphere of free discussion and independent thinking has been increasingly promoted. It is deeply believed that the development of our country's culture and academics will inevitably reach a new high along with economic construction. Marxism-Leninism, as the guiding ideology of socialist countries, has developed from a long struggle. It is a universally scientific truth that has been proven by social practice. The more truth is debated, the clearer it becomes. The contention of a hundred schools of thought will help enrich and develop Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, I believe that the contention of a hundred schools of thought and ideological remolding are not opposed but complementary. However, because we are in a socialist society, objective development is advancing rapidly, and our subjective understanding is more likely to lag behind objective development. Therefore, the meticulous and long-term work of ideological remolding must be carried out regularly and continuously. In old China and in capitalist countries, the ruling class, in order to fool the people, does not allow the people to come into contact with the truth. Only in socialist countries, in the people's democratic China led by the Communist Party, is it possible to widely carry out conscious, voluntary, and planned self-education and self-transformation throughout the country in various appropriate ways, forming an atmosphere of "tireless learning" and achieving the atmosphere of "daily renewal, daily new again" that the ancients sought, overcoming subjectivism in thought, strengthening the foresight in our work plans, and enabling our understanding and efforts to meet the objective needs of the development of socialist cause. This is also one of the great things that we have done under the leadership of the Party and the government that no one has ever done before. We should work together to persist in it.
      (2) The brilliant achievements in all aspects of our country's economic and cultural construction undeniably prove the superiority of the socialist system and also fully prove the superiority of our people's democracy. Our state system is a system of people's congresses based on the principle of democratic centralism. People's congresses at all levels are the highest organs of power, both decision-making organs and working organs with real power. The people control their own country through it. This is fundamentally different from the parliamentary system in capitalist countries. The parliament of the bourgeoisie is nominally supreme, but in reality, it is subject to the executive branch (for example, the US president has the power to veto parliamentary resolutions), which makes it easier for the oligarchy of monopoly capital to implement dictatorship over the vast majority of the people. The power of our people's congress comes directly from the people. The people's representatives are freely elected by the people in accordance with the democratic electoral law. Therefore, people's congresses at all levels are composed of representatives of the overwhelming majority of workers, peasants, working intellectuals, and various democratic strata. This gives our state organs the broadest mass base and makes it easier to give play to the wisdom and creativity of the masses. At the same time, it is the most powerful and prestigious, calling on the people to exert collective strength, overcome difficulties, and create miracles for socialist construction. The victorious progress of our construction cause is inseparable from the superiority of our socialist democratic political system. This is in sharp contrast to the situation in capitalist countries, where all kinds of restrictions turn universal suffrage into a deceptive trick, and oppression and deception are used to manipulate elections, so that the will of the voters cannot be expressed, and the two major parties are used to control parliament, and the dictatorship of monopoly capital is implemented in the name of parliamentary democracy. For example, more than 10 million black workers in the United States are not only largely deprived of the right to vote in practice, but also suffer unimaginable racial discrimination and persecution. Under the threat of organized (Ku Klux Klan) lynching and massacres, the lives and property of blacks are not guaranteed. The vast number of workers in the United States fill the wallets of capitalists with their blood and sweat. They not only do not have their own representatives in parliament, but certainly do not have their own friends in government agencies, and have been subjected to oppression and bullying under the rule of laws such as the Taft-Hartley anti-labor bill. In China, as in the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, the people are the masters of the country. In the United States, the bourgeoisie, mainly the monopoly capital group, not only dominates the country's economic life, controls political power, and uses the two major parties to play "democracy," but also places important newspapers, book publishing undertakings, news agencies, forums, films, television, radio, schools, research institutions and all other major undertakings related to cultural education under their monopoly rule in order to create public opinion and control people's thoughts. In the United States, where fascist legislation such as the Smith Act and McCarthyism are rampant, everyone who demands democracy, peace, and progress faces crazy persecution. Except for capitalists and the lackeys of capitalists, the people have no freedom. Here, we practice democracy for ourselves and exercise dictatorship only over the enemies of the people. However, the imperialists falsely accuse people's China of not having "democracy." I would like to advise some friends who remain in the United States and yearn for democracy to return to China as soon as possible to share freedom and happiness.
    There are many difficulties encountered in the development of our cause, and shortcomings and mistakes in our work are inevitable. However, with the basic solution of domestic class contradictions, democratic life is increasingly developed, and the new legal system is increasingly sound. The further development of criticism and self-criticism of the work of organs and the work style of cadres in various meetings, the continued strengthening of democratic management in enterprises and agricultural cooperatives, and the widespread launching of inspections against bureaucracy in state organs all show that the contradictions within the people brought about by the new situation are non-antagonistic, and can be adjusted and satisfactorily resolved through criticism and self-criticism in accordance with the principle of overall planning and appropriate arrangements.
    The people's democratic united front, as an important link in our people's democracy, is increasingly developed and consolidated. After the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision was put forward, all democratic parties were deeply moved by the Communist Party's great public spirit and humble spirit, and were encouraged to work hard for the great responsibilities in the future. Our country is a socialist country led by the working class, and the Communist Party of China is the leading force in our revolutionary and construction cause and the leading force in our united front. Therefore, on the one hand, all democratic parties have political freedom and organizational independence. On the other hand, they move closer to the Party, accept leadership, and work together for the socialist cause. This is the correct path to implement long-term coexistence and mutual supervision, and it is also an effective method to further exert their positive role. All democratic parties have participated in the government, accepted socialism, and are willing to do their best to serve the people. This socialist ideological unity and common stand, especially under the conditions of the basic solution of domestic class contradictions, determines that all different opinions of democratic parties can be resolved through consultation, and there is no possibility of the bourgeois parties in Western countries fighting for power and profit. Under the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision, all democratic parties must further do their own work well, especially strengthen ideological education and expand the work of contacting the masses. At the same time, they should take the initiative to reflect situations to the Party and the government and actively put forward opinions, knowing everything and saying everything, carry out criticism and self-criticism, discuss and consult to achieve mutual supervision, and assist in uniting all forces that can be united to jointly struggle for building a socialist society and defending world peace. As a member of a democratic party, I wholeheartedly support this policy and am willing to make due efforts for its implementation.
    (3) Finally, I would like to say a few words to the Kuomintang personnel in Taiwan from the podium of the CPPCC. We are very excited to know from Premier Zhou's report that more and more Kuomintang personnel in Taiwan are willing to promote peaceful liberation, and the possibility of peaceful liberation of Taiwan is getting bigger and bigger. Therefore, we are extremely angry at the US government's conspiracy to obstruct and undermine it. Taiwan is Chinese territory. Liberating Taiwan is our own business. Any interference by the United States, as well as any so-called "two Chinas" conspiracy, will be resolutely opposed by the Chinese people and is destined to fail completely.
    The Kuomintang personnel in Taiwan left their hometowns back then, succumbed to the US imperialists, and vainly hoped to rely on external forces to make a comeback, or regarded the enemy as a friend, thinking that sheltering in the United States could survive and wait for an opportunity to move. Now, the prosperity and strength of the motherland, the great development from victory to victory in all aspects, has shattered all the illusions you had in the past of being an accomplice of evil, fighting among yourselves, and succeeding by chance. The US imperialism has revealed its true colors and has instigated elements who advertise so-called "free China" and so-called "Taiwan independence elements" to carry out pro-US and anti-Chiang activities, attempting to turn Taiwan into an American colony like Honolulu. This is probably something that the Kuomintang personnel in Taiwan did not expect when they left the motherland back then, right? We are all one family of patriots. The people of the motherland have already extended their hands to welcome you back. This is the time for you to resolutely promote the peaceful liberation of Taiwan and save the country and yourselves. With the support of 600 million compatriots on the mainland, the imperialists' obstruction and sabotage are futile. If you do not make a decisive decision today and implement peaceful liberation, there will be a conspiracy from the United States externally and popular grievances in Taiwan internally. Calamities will arise unexpectedly, and you will be ruined and discredited. It will be too late to regret!
    The brilliant achievements of the motherland's construction and the happy and free life of the people have amazed the enemy and cheered the friends. All Chinese people are delighted and united to continue their efforts. Are the so-called "free China elements" and "Taiwan independence elements" not Chinese? They are willing to recognize thieves as fathers and sell their country for glory. Where is your conscience? Where is the way out? The ancients said, "What Zhao Meng values, Zhao Meng can despise." You should also learn a lesson from the United States' treatment of the Kuomintang personnel in Taiwan. Premier Zhou said it well: "Selling the country for glory will not only gain no glory, but will also leave a bad name for ten thousand years." For your own sake and the sake of your children, you should change your plans and return to the motherland. The motherland is the loving mother of all Chinese people, and she always welcomes her children who have lost their way.
    If the Kuomintang personnel in Taiwan still pin their dreams of "armed homecoming" on the opportunity of the United States provoking a third world war, it is time to wake up. As Premier Zhou analyzed, the general trend in the world is towards easing and progress. The socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union are increasingly united and powerful, the forces of peace and neutrality are expanding, the contradictions between the United States and Britain and France are becoming increasingly acute, the internal contradictions of the US economic foundation, which are deep and cannot be resolved, are becoming increasingly unstable, and the US policy of expansion, aggression, and arms expansion and war preparations is becoming increasingly unpopular and is falling into political isolation. All this makes it necessary for US imperialism to think twice before launching a war. Even if it launches a war in disregard of the opposition of the people of the world, it will only follow in the footsteps of Hitler and Tojo and bring destruction upon itself. I believe that the Kuomintang personnel in Taiwan will not abandon the motherland and perish with the decadent and self-destructive imperialism.
    The Kuomintang personnel in Taiwan should also dispel all concerns and recognize that the united front policy is a basic policy firmly implemented by the Communist Party of China and the People's Government, which is sufficient to ensure that the spirit of patriotism and family will always be implemented. Facts have proved that the Communist Party always puts the interests of the people above everything else. Therefore, it can give play to the great spirit of impartiality and unite all patriotic people to achieve today's construction achievements. Only socialist society regards people as the most valuable social wealth and does not allow talents to be buried. In order to unite all forces that can be united to build socialism, New China fully takes care of the old personnel, especially the uprising Kuomintang personnel, in life, and appropriately arranges their work, so that everyone can give play to their strengths and feel mentally happy. There is no distinction between early and late patriotism. If the Kuomintang personnel in Taiwan resolutely promote the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, it will be a major contribution to the interests of the nation and world peace, and will be warmly welcomed and duly valued by the motherland. The future of the motherland is infinitely bright, and the future of the people who return to the embrace of the motherland is also very bright.
    Premier Zhou said in his report: "The trend of Taiwan returning to the embrace of the motherland is irresistible. There is no force in the world that can forever separate the Chinese from the Chinese." "All Chinese people with blood should unite in the spirit of patriotism and family, unite as one, and smash the conspiracies of US imperialism." Premier Zhou's great call represents the voice of more than 600 million Chinese people on the mainland. I hope that the Kuomintang personnel in Taiwan will respond to the call, resolutely promote the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, return to the embrace of the motherland, and build a socialist society and share the happiness of freedom and prosperity with the people of the whole country.

　　程希孟说
　　祖国前途灿烂无比
　　台湾军政人员应憣然改计归向祖国
    我参加这次政协会议，感到莫大的光荣和无限的兴奋。毛主席在最高国务会议上的讲话，周总理、陈云副总理和李富春副总理在政协会议上的报告给了我极大的启发和鼓舞。我表示完全的同意和衷心的拥护。
    现在我想说几点个人的体会和意见，请大会指正。
      （一）思想改造工作对于我国社会主义事业的伟大发展起很大的作用，继续积极提倡是必要的。我们这种思想改造完全是一种人民内部的、自愿的自我教育过程：通过工作的锻炼、社会实践和观察，以及政治理论的学习，改造自己从旧社会得来的坏习惯和坏思想，树立革命的人生观，站在劳动人民的立场，学习运用辩证唯物主义的科学思想方法，全面的、客观的考虑问题，提高自己，改进工作。这样的思想改造也正是为了人民的利益，从团结愿望出发，经过批评和自我批评，达到在新基础上的团结，达到治病救人，变消极因素为积极因素之目的。在一个落后而又贫困的大国里，我们的社会主义建设和社会主义改造所以能在解放后短短几年内取得决定性的胜利，是和我们在党和政府领导与关怀之下进行的自我教育和自我改造工作的成就分不开的。
    我是一个旧知识分子，也是一个旧外交人员。1950年，从美国回到祖国怀抱后，就是在工作和学习中进行自我教育，才认识社会发展的规律，真正体会共产党和毛主席的伟大，接受马克思列宁主义的真理，对于解放前为统治阶级服务，损害人民利益的罪过，深自痛恨。从思想上分清敌我，在精神上获得解放，勇气百倍地进行工作，以能把自己全部力量贡献给祖国伟大的社会主义建设而感到无比的兴奋与无上的幸福。
    我们的思想改造工作的一个特点是依照自觉自愿原则进行学习。自从党明确提出在文艺上百花齐放，在学术上百家争鸣的方针以来，自由讨论、独立思考的风气，日益发扬。深信我国的文化学术的发展，必将随着经济建设而达到新的高涨。作为社会主义国家的指导思想的马列主义，是从长期斗争中发展起来的。经过社会实践证明了的普遍科学真理。真理愈辩愈明。百家争鸣将有助于马克思列宁主义的丰富和发展。所以我认为百家争鸣和思想改造不是对立的而是互相配合的。但是由于处在社会主义的社会里，客观的发展一日千里，我们的主观认识更容易落后于客观的发展，思想改造这种细致的长期的工作就必须经常的不断的进行。在旧中国和在资本主义国家，统治阶级为了愚民，不让人民接触到真理。只有在社会主义国家，在共产党领导的人民民主的中国，才有条件在全国范围内，以各种适当方式，广泛的进行自觉自愿而又有计划的自我教育和自我改造，形成“好学不倦”的风气，达到古人所企求的“日日新又日新”的气象，克服思想上的主观主义，加强我们工作计划中的预见性，使我们的认识和努力能够符合社会主义事业发展的客观需要。这也是在党和政府领导下我们所做的前人从未做过的伟大事情之一。我们应该共同努力坚持进行。
      （二）我国经济文化建设各方面的辉煌成就，无可争辩地证明了社会主义制度的优越性，也充分证明了我们人民民主的优越性。我们的国家制度是基于民主集中原则的人民代表大会制。各级人大是最高权力机关，既是议事决策机关，又是真正有权力的工作机关。人民通过它掌握自己的国家。这与资本主义国家议会制根本不同。资产阶级的议会名为至高无上，实则受制于行政（例如美国总统就对议会决议有否决权），使垄断资本的寡头统治更便于对广大人民实行专政。我国人大的权力直接来自人民，人大代表是由人民依照民主的选举法自由选出的，因而各级人大都是由压倒多数的工人、农民、劳动知识分子和各民主阶层的代表所组成的，这使我们国家机关具有最广泛的群众基础，最便于发挥群众的智慧和创造能力，同时也最有力量和威信，号召人民为社会主义建设发挥集体力量，克服困难，创造奇迹。我们建设事业所以能胜利进行，是与我们社会主义的民主政治制度的优越性分不开的。这和资本主义国家，用种种限制把普选变为欺人的把戏，并且采用压迫和欺骗手段，操纵选举，使选民的意志无法表现，从而运用两大政党支配议会，假借议会民主之名，实行垄断资本独裁的情况，成为鲜明的对照。例如：美国的一千多万黑人劳工不仅实际上大都被剥夺了选举权，而且遭受难以形容的种族歧视与迫害。在有组织的（三K党）私刑和屠杀的威胁下，黑人的生命财产朝不保夕。美国广大的工人将自己的血汗充填了资本家的钱包，他们不仅在议会中没有自己的代表，在政府机关中当然更没有自己的朋友，而且一直在塔夫脱—哈特莱反劳工法案之类的法令统治下，受尽压迫欺凌。在中国，也同在苏联及其他社会主义国家一样，人民是国家的主人。在美国，资产阶级，主要是垄断资本集团不仅支配国家的经济生活，掌握政权，运用两大政党，扮演“民主”，而且将重要的报刊图书出版事业、通讯社、讲坛、电影、电视、广播、学校、研究机构等一切有关文化教育的主要事业，都放在它们垄断统治之下，以便制造舆论，控制人民的思想。在史密斯法之类法西斯立法和麦卡锡主义大肆猖狂的美国，每一个要求民主和平与进步的人都面临着疯狂的迫害。除了资本家和资本家的走狗之外，人民是没有自由的。在我们这里人民对自己实行民主，只对人民的敌人实行专政，然而帝国主义者反诬蔑人民中国没有“民主”。我倒想奉劝留在美国而向往民主的一些朋友及早回国同享自由幸福。
    在我们事业的发展中遇到的困难是很多的，工作上的缺点和错误也是难免的。但是随着国内阶级矛盾的基本解决，民主生活日益发展了，新的法制日益健全了。在各种会议上，对机关工作和干部作风的批评与自我批评的进一步展开，企业和农业合作社中民主管理的继续加强，国家机关中反对官僚主义的检查的广泛发动，这一切都足以说明由新情况带来的人民内部的矛盾都是非对抗性的，完全可以通过批评与自我批评，按照统筹兼顾适当安排的原则，加以调整，获得满意的解决。
    作为我国人民民主重要一环的人民民主统一战线是日益发展和巩固了。长期共存互相监督的方针提出后，各民主党派莫不为共产党的大公无私虚怀若谷的精神所深深感动，为今后自己责任的重大而鼓舞奋发。我国是一个以工人阶级为领导的社会主义国家，中国共产党是我们革命和建设事业的领导力量，是我们统一战线的领导力量，因此各民主党派一方面政治自由，组织独立，一方面向党靠拢，接受领导，共同为社会主义事业而努力，这是贯彻长期共存互相监督的正确道路，也是进一步发挥自己的积极作用的有效方法。各民主党派均已参加政府，接受社会主义，愿为人民服务尽最大的努力。这种社会主义的思想一致性和共同立场，尤其在国内阶级矛盾基本解决的条件下，就决定了各民主党派一切不同意见更可以协商解决，而根本没有西方国家资产阶级政党那种争权夺利互相倾轧的可能。在长期共存互相监督的方针下，各民主党派必须进一步做好自己的工作，特别加强思想教育和扩大群众联系的工作，同时对于党和政府更主动反映情况，更积极提出意见，知无不言，言无不尽，开展批评与自我批评，讨论协商达到互相监督，并协助团结一切可能团结的力量为建设社会主义社会、保卫世界和平而共同奋斗。作为民主党派的一个成员，我衷心拥护这个方针，并愿为它的贯彻作应有的努力。
    （三）最后，我愿借政协的讲坛对台湾国民党人员讲几句话。我们从周总理报告中，知道台湾国民党人员愿意促进和平解放的越来越多，台湾和平解放的可能性越来越大，而感到非常兴奋，因而对美国政府阻挠破坏的阴谋，更是万分愤恨。台湾是中国的领土。解放台湾是我们中国人自己的事。美国的任何干涉，以及任何方面搞的所谓“两个中国”的阴谋，都为中国人所坚决反对，是注定要彻底失败的。
    台湾国民党人员当年离乡背井，屈从美帝国主义者，无非妄想凭借外力，卷土重来，或者认敌为友，以为托庇美国可以苟延残喘，待机而动。现在，祖国的繁荣强盛，在一切方面从胜利走向胜利的伟大发展，已使你们过去为虎作伥、同室操戈、侥幸得逞的种种幻想全归破灭，而美帝国主义图穷而匕首现，已经策动标榜所谓“自由中国”分子和所谓“台湾独立分子”，进行亲美反蒋活动，企图把台湾变成像檀香山一样的美国属地。这大概也不是台湾国民党人员当年脱离祖国时始料所不及的吧？爱国一家。祖国人民早已伸出双手欢迎你们回来，这正是你们坚决促成和平解放台湾，报国自救的时候了。有大陆上六亿同胞支持你们，帝国主义的阻挠破坏是徒然的。事至今天，如果不当机立断，贯彻和平解放，则外有美国之阴谋，内有台湾之民愤，祸起腋下，变生不测，身败名裂，悔之何及！
    祖国建设的辉煌成就，人民生活的幸福自由，使敌人为之惊异，朋友为之欢呼，凡是中国人都欢欣鼓舞，团结一致继续努力。所谓“自由中国分子”和“台湾独立分子”难道不是中国人？竟肯认贼作父，卖国求荣。良心何存，出路何在？古人说“赵孟之所贵，赵孟能贱之”。你们也应该从美国对台湾国民党人员的作法吸取教训。周总理说得好：“卖国求荣不仅无荣可得，而且还得遗臭万年”。为你们自身及你们子孙计，你们也应憣然改计，归向祖国。祖国是一切中国人的慈母，对于迷途知返的儿女总是欢迎的。
    台湾国民党人员如果还把“武装还乡”的迷梦寄托在美国挑起第三次世界大战的机会上，现在是应该清醒了。正如周总理所分析的，世界总的趋势是走向和缓走向进步的。以苏联为首的社会主义国家日益团结而强大，和平中立的力量日益扩大，美国和英法的矛盾日趋尖锐化，内在矛盾深刻无法解决的美国经济基础日益不稳固，美国的扩张、侵略、扩军备战的政策日益不得人心而陷于政治上的孤立。这一切使得美帝国主义在发动战争之前必须三思而行的。即令它不顾全世界人民的反对，发动战争，也只有步希特勒、东条的后尘，自取灭亡。相信台湾国民党人员是不会自绝于祖国，而与腐朽的自掘坟墓的帝国主义同归于尽的。
    台湾国民党人员还应该打消一切顾虑，认识统一战线政策是中国共产党和人民政府坚决执行的一项基本政策，足以保证爱国一家的精神始终贯彻下去。事实证明：共产党永远是把人民的利益放在一切之上，因此，能够发挥大公无私的伟大精神，把一切爱国的人士团结起来，达到今天的建设成就。只有社会主义社会把人当作最宝贵的社会财富，不让人才埋没。为着团结一切可能团结的力量以建设社会主义，新中国对于旧人员，特别是起义的国民党人士，生活上充分照顾，工作上适当安排，使大家都能发挥所长，精神愉快。爱国不分先后。台湾国民党人员如果坚决促成台湾的和平解放，对民族利益与世界和平都是重大的贡献，将获得祖国的热烈欢迎与应有的重视。祖国的前途，灿烂无比，回到祖国怀抱的人们的前途也是很光明的。
    周总理在报告中说道：“台湾回到祖国怀抱的大势是不可阻挡的。世界上没有任何力量可以把中国人同中国人永远分割开来”。“一切有血性的中国人都应该本着爱国一家的精神，团结起来，一致对外，粉碎美帝国主义的阴谋”。周总理这个伟大的号召代表着大陆上六亿多中国人民的呼声。希望台湾国民党人员响应号召，坚决促成台湾的和平解放，回到祖国怀抱，和全国人民一起建设社会主义社会，同享自由繁荣的幸福。
