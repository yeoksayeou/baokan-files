Xinhua News Agency, March 26th—The People's Liberation Army's work in evaluating outstanding marksmen and technical experts in various units has recently concluded. Based on the 1956 training results, hundreds of thousands of people throughout the army have been selected as outstanding marksmen and technical experts, and many others have received the title of advanced worker. These outstanding marksmen, technical experts, and advanced workers have been praised and rewarded by their superiors, and their families have also received congratulatory messages from the leadership organs of the units.

During the past year’s campaign for outstanding marksmen and technical experts, PLA units have launched a wave of learning technology and delving into skills, and training results have greatly exceeded those of previous years. Many divisions and regiments have achieved excellent results in overall evaluations. At the same time, many companies, platoons, and squads with "all members excellent" have emerged: in one unit, twenty-seven platoons had all members as outstanding marksmen; in another unit, the communications platoon leader of the third battalion was an advanced worker, and all others were technical experts. Many of those selected as outstanding marksmen and technical experts were new recruits who joined the army last year. Among the thirteen new recruits in the sixth company of a certain unit, twelve became outstanding marksmen.

Currently, various units are summarizing the experiences of the outstanding marksmen and technical expert campaign and have decided to continue to vigorously carry out this campaign in this year's training work, striving for the emergence of more outstanding marksmen and technical experts. According to this year's training tasks, the leading organs of the garrison troops in Nanjing, Beijing and other regions have also revised the conditions and standards for the selection of outstanding marksmen and technical experts.
