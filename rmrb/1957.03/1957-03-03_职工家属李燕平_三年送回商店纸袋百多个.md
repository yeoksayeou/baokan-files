    Employee's Family Member Li Yanping
    Returns Over a Hundred Paper Bags to the Store in Three Years
    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: When you return from the store after buying something, have you ever thought of returning the paper bag to the store for reuse? In Shanghai's Caoyang New Village, there is a housewife who has been doing this for three years, returning a total of more than one hundred paper bags to the store.
    This housewife is named Li Yanping, and she is an employee's family member. After moving into Caoyang New Village in the second half of 1953, she couldn't bear to destroy the paper bags every time she came back from shopping. She always flattened the used paper bags and put them away, and when she had accumulated a certain number, she would return them to the store.
    Li Yanping's deeds of cherishing public property have recently been commended by the store where she frequently shops and the family committee she belongs to. The store's salespersons did the math: if every customer was like Li Yanping, the store could use more than thirty yuan less of paper each month.

    职工家属李燕平
    三年送回商店纸袋百多个
    新华社讯  当你从商店里买东西回来的时候，有没有想到过把盛东西的纸袋送回给店里再度使用？上海曹杨新村有一位家庭主妇，三年来一直这么做了，一共给商店送回了一百多只纸袋。
    这位家庭主妇名叫李燕平，是职工家属。她在1953年下半年搬进曹杨新村以后，每次从商店买东西回来，都舍不得把纸袋毁掉。她总是把用完的纸袋折平放起来，积到一定数量，就送回给商店。
    李燕平爱护公共财物的事迹，最近受到了她经常买东西的商店和她所在的家属委员会的表扬。商店的营业员算了一下账：如果每个顾客都和李燕平一样，这个店每月就能少用三十多元的纸张。
