Some Opinions on How to Conduct Research on the Periodization of Ancient History
Chen Mengjia

Since liberation, many historical workers have been very interested in the problem of periodization of ancient Chinese history. This is of great practical significance for the study of periodization of ancient history. Whether in the study of historical facts, in teaching, or in museum displays, it is necessary to correctly divide the stages of development of Chinese society.

There are various different opinions on how to solve such an important problem. Some people think that this problem should be solved quickly. They propose to discuss this issue intensively in books, newspapers and magazines, or to bring different schools of thought together to discuss and solve it. Some people think that a conclusion should be reached sooner rather than later, even if it is not definitive. A generally accepted view, even temporary, could be immediately put into effect in teaching, book writing, and museum displays. Others believe that it is not necessary to "solve" this problem within a deadline, nor to formally stipulate a temporary adoption of any particular view, but rather to conduct long-term research and discussion on this issue.

Personally, I have always been involved in organizing materials. Based on my own conservative view, I advocate a slow and deliberate approach to the study of such an important and complex problem. Academic problems cannot be handled hastily. When opinions are divided and there is no consensus, different opinions should be debated as much as possible. If we consider the issue of historical periodization as a long-term discussion and research, and conduct detailed research work in a more relaxed manner, I think it may reach its goal sooner. Within ten or eight years, if efforts are made effectively, perhaps we can get a rough outline of the periodization of Chinese history. Constantly discovered underground materials, the organization and research of documentary materials, and more in-depth research in theoretical aspects will surely revise and supplement our views at any time.

I feel that to solve the problem of periodization of ancient history, we must first prepare several important materials. They are: First, the textual research and interpretation of documentary materials, especially official histories and classics. Second, the comprehensive research, dating research, and ancient writing research of archaeological materials.

First, let's talk about the textual research and interpretation of documentary materials, especially official histories and classics. In recent years, we have often seen people eagerly using ancient books. However, very few people have done some actual basic work, that is, to test the age of ancient books and to sort out and interpret the content of books. For such an important issue as historical periodization, it is even more necessary to carefully distinguish the source of materials and their correct age. The classics, histories, philosophical works, and collections of literature are still the most important documentary materials today, but there are still many problems. Recently, some people have been working hard to find materials outside of official histories that were not valued in the past, which is very correct. However, when studying history, official history is still the most basic material. A young graduate student, studying the social nature of the Han Dynasty, wrote a lengthy article, citing many books, including the Book of Han. However, in order to complete a paper in two or three years, and with the conclusion already decided in the assigned topic, he had no time to conduct detailed and objective research on the Book of Han, but only looked for evidence in the book that was favorable to the conclusion. Such a research method, of course, cannot solve major problems.

Here, I am reminded of Mr. Wang Guowei's research on ancient history. There are at least two points worth mentioning again today. One is that he had a general understanding of the traditional historical records, geography, and customs of a certain period he studied (such as the Yin and Zhou dynasties), before he could conduct focused exploration of some specialized issues. Second, he had a general understanding of a batch of documentary materials he used (such as the Book of Poetry, the Book of Documents, the Spring and Autumn Annals, the Discourses of the States, etc.) before he could combine underground materials (oracle bones, bronze inscriptions) and verify each other to write works like "New Evidence of Ancient History." I think this method of learning is still worth learning today. To study ancient history, one must have a basic knowledge of history, be able to focus on solving some key problems; must read several complete official histories and classics, and must also be proficient in some specialized books (such as the Book of Documents, the Bamboo Annals). If our understanding of classics such as the Book of Documents, the Spring and Autumn Annals, and the Bamboo Annals is still only at the past level, then even if we have a very good method, it will be difficult to solve major problems in history.

Mr. Wang Guowei was not a philologist, nor was he specialized in archaeology. However, in the study of ancient history, he was an outstanding master in the past fifty years because he himself delved into archaeological materials and found new facts from ancient writings. If we only talk back and forth among different opinions today, and quote back and forth in limited documents, without better inheriting the textual research of the Qing Dynasty to organize ancient books, and without better inheriting the ancient writing studies of the late Qing Dynasty to study oracle bone inscriptions and bronze inscriptions, then our research on the problem of historical periodization will certainly not be able to leap forward. In the past ten years, the discipline of ancient writing studies has stagnated, which is a major and fatal injury to the study of ancient history. Of course, we must also avoid some nitpicking ideas, thinking that ancient writings can solve all the intractable diseases of ancient history, and thinking that recognizing a character can invent great principles. I once saw a manuscript saying that he found the character for iron in oracle bone inscriptions, so the Yin Dynasty must have used iron, which is inappropriate. We need to study philology patiently, which is a knowledge that cannot be rushed.

Now everyone is eyeing the newly unearthed archaeological materials, waiting for it to tell some news that is not found in books. Our gratifying excavation work today has been expanded and developed because of the great socialist construction. Because of this, a lot of field work has been done, but there is no time to do detailed work on comprehensive research. Archaeological reports are not only hideous, but also biased, due to our lack of time, learning, and theory. However, historical workers are constantly making demands on archaeological workers, and also asking philologists to translate ancient writings into modern texts, in short, demanding to use this material as soon as possible. This requirement is understandable. We once called for archaeological work to serve historical science, making archaeology an important resource in historical research. But today, I think we also have reason to hope that historical workers do not have to wait for ready-made comprehensive and well-translated materials, but should jointly participate in this work, and should make archaeology an indispensable part of historical research. Now young archaeological workers have a passion for learning historical documents, and I think that, conversely, young historical researchers should also learn more about archaeology and philology.

Regarding archaeology, we might as well add another sentence: it started in the Song Dynasty. The era of "epigraphy" before scientific excavation was a period of which Chinese archaeology can be proud. Today, our research on the history of the Yin and Zhou dynasties mainly relies on the materials left over from "epigraphy." Not to mention modern scientific excavation products, but the ancient artifacts and their inscriptions since the Song Dynasty still need us to better organize, research, and date. Field excavation materials are very important, and should be published in a timely manner, and also comprehensively studied in a timely manner. Past archaeological data should be sorted out quickly, simply put, printed out as soon as possible. Now everyone is willing to study big topics and disdain to do the work of sorting out data. When you advise people to sort out materials, they say I still have to do research. Examining books and examining old archaeological materials are both urgent tasks for today's research on historical periodization.

In addition, there are some problems in ancient geography and ancient chronology, which must also be studied by someone in a timely manner. We need accurate chronologies and usable historical maps. We have some foundation for these past works, and we only need to do further research.

I am full of confidence in the new historical science and the study of the periodization of Chinese history, and I am willing to do my best to organize materials. I believe that doing so will not only help the study of historical problems, but can also be said to be a contribution.

    对怎样进行古史分期的研究的一些意见
    陈梦家
    解放以来，不少历史工作者对中国古史分期问题感到很大的兴趣。这对古史分期的研究有很大的现实意义。无论在历史事实的研究上、在教学上、在博物馆的陈列上，都需要正确地划分中国社会的发展阶段。
    对如何解决这样一个重要的问题，目前有各种不同的意见。有人以为应该快一点解决这个问题，他们提议在书报杂志上集中讨论这个问题，或是集不同诸家于一堂而讨论解决。有人以为应该快一点早一点决定一种说法，那怕是未成定论。有一种大家可暂时通用的说法，那末在教学、编书和博物馆的陈列上可以立刻生效。还有人以为不必要求在一个期限内“解决”这个问题，不必非正式地规定暂时采用哪一种说法，而对此问题进行长期的研究和讨论。
    我个人一向是整理材料的，根据自己保守的看法是，对待这样一个重要而复杂的问题，主张慢慢地从容地去研究。学术问题不能采用急躁处理的办法，在意见纷歧、莫衷一是的时候，应该尽量地进行不同的意见的辩论。假使我们对历史分期问题认为是长期性的讨论和研究，比较从容地进行细致的研究工作，我想它反而可能早一点达到目的。在十年八年内，要是努力得法，也许对于中国的历史分期可以得到一个大致的轮廓。不断发现的地下材料和文献资料的整理研究和理论方面更深入的研究，一定会随时修正和补充我们的看法。
    我觉得要解决古史分期问题，目前先要作好几种重要材料的准备工作。就是：一、对文献材料，特别是正史、经典的考订、考释。二、对考古材料的综合研究、断代研究和古文字研究。
    先说对文献材料，特别是正史、经典的考订、考释。这几年来，我们常常看到有人对古代典籍，急不可待地加以利用。但是还很少有人作一些实际的基础的工作，就是试将古书的年代考证一下，对于书本内容整理考释一下。对于历史分期这样一个重要问题，更需要详确地分辨材料的来源及其正确的年代。经史子集还是今天最重要的文献材料，但是问题还多。近来有些人很用力于在正史以外找从前不大重视的材料，这是非常对的。但是研究历史，正史还是最基本的材料。有一个青年研究生，研究汉代的社会性质，写出了洋洋大文，引了许多书，当然也引了汉书。但是，要在二、三年内完成一篇论文，并且在指定的题目早已决定了结论的情况下，他就无暇对汉书作详细的客观的研究，只是在书本中找与结论有利的证据罢了。这样的研究方法当然不能解决重大的问题。
    我在此想到王国维先生的古史研究，至少有二点值得今天再提出来的。一是他对所研究的某一段时期（譬如殷、周）的传统历史记载、地理、礼俗有一个大概的认识，然后才有可能对某一些专门问题作集中的探讨。二是他对于所应用的一批文献材料（譬如诗、书、春秋、国语等）有一个大概的认识，然后才有可能结合地下的材料（甲骨、金文），互相印证，写出“古史新证”一类的著作。这种治学的方法，我认为至今还是值得学习的。要研究古史，必须有历史的基础知识，必须能专门集中地解决一些关键问题；必须通读若干整本的正史、经典，也必须精通某一些专书（如尚书、竹书纪年）。我们今天对于尚书、春秋、纪年等经典若仍然只有过去的水平，那末即使我们有很好的方法，也很难解决历史上的重大问题。
    王国维先生不是一个文字学家，也并不以考古为他的专长的。然而在古史的研究中，他所以是近五十年来杰出的大师，在于他自己钻入考古材料中，自己从古文字中找新的事实。我们今天倘使只在不同的说法中说来说去，在有限的文献中引来引去，不更好地承继清代的考证之学而整理古书，不更好地承继清末古文字学而研究甲骨金文，那末我们的历史分期问题的研究一定不容易飞跃而成。近十年中，古文字学这一门学科，停滞不前，这对于研究古史是个重大的致命伤。当然同时也要避免一些钻牛角尖的想法，以为古文字能解决古史的一切疑难杂症，以为认识一个字可以发明大道理。我曾见到一篇稿子，说他发现了甲骨文有铁字，因此殷代一定用铁了，这是不妥当的。我们需要耐心地研究文字学，这是一件急不来的学问。
    现在大家都虎视眈眈地看着新出土的考古材料，等待它说出一些书本上所没有的新闻。我们今天可喜的发掘工作，是因为伟大的社会主义建设而有了扩大和发展。也因为如此，田野工作作得多，而无暇作综合研究的细致工作。考古报告不但面目可憎，而且是亲疏不分，这由于我们的时间、学力、理论都不够。然而历史工作者对考古工作者不断提出要求，也向文字学者提出翻译古文字为今文的要求，总之要求及早利用这种材料。这种要求是可理解的。我们曾经呼吁考古工作为历史科学服务，使考古成为历史研究中重要的一个资源。但到了今天，我想我们也有理由希望历史工作者不必等待现成综合好和翻译好的材料，应该共同参加这种工作，应该使考古成为历史研究者不可少的一部分。现在青年的考古工作者对于历史文献有要求学习的热情，我想反过来青年历史研究者也该多多学习考古学和文字学。
    关于考古学，我们不妨再补一句，它是从宋代开始的。科学发掘以前的“金石学”时代是中国考古学可以骄傲的一个时期。我们今天研究殷周史，主要靠“金石学”遗留下来的资料，不要说近代科学发掘品，就是宋以来的古器物及其铭文，还需要我们更好地作整理研究和断代研究的工作。田野发掘材料非常重要，要及时地发表，也要及时地综合研究。过去的考古资料，要快快地整理出来，简单说，早点印出来。现在大家都愿意研究大题目，不屑于作整理资料的工作。你劝人整理材料，他就说我还要研究呢。考证书本和考订旧日的考古材料，都是今天研究历史分期急不可缓的工作。
    此外，古地理和古年代存在着若干问题，也是必须及时有人研究的。我们需要准确的年表和可用的历史地图。这些，我们过去的工作是有些底子的，只需要作进一步的研究。
    对于新的历史学，对于中国历史分期的研究，我是满怀信心的，愿以所能努力地整理材料，我相信这样做不但有助于历史问题的研究，也可以说是有贡献的。
