　　Listen to the Opinions of Veteran Farmers

    This newspaper reports that the contract production plan of the Liu Lin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Miao Li Township, Zhengzhou City suburbs, Henan Province, is positive, reliable, and satisfies everyone this year. One of the main reasons is that this cooperative pays attention to listening to the opinions of veteran farmers.

    Last year, the agricultural cooperative's annual production plan was set too high and too large, failing to align with reality. At that time, many people, especially veteran farmers, disagreed, but the cooperative cadres did not consider these opinions. Instead, they considered them to be "right-leaning conservative" ideas at play. As a result, the original plan fell through.

    During last year's cooperative rectification work, the cooperative management committee deeply recognized this lesson and valued the experience of veteran farmers. During the promotion of democracy, special attention was paid to soliciting the opinions of veteran farmers, and a group was organized to visit veteran farmers. Veteran farmers offered many criticisms and rationalization suggestions on all aspects of production leadership and management. Now, many correct opinions have been implemented into the 1957 production plan. For example, the plan stipulates to make full use of water conservancy conditions to irrigate 5,000 mu of wheat and convert 5,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields. Relying on cooperative members to accumulate fertilizer, spending less money on buying fertilizer. Regarding the promotion of fine varieties, in addition to the universal promotion of already successfully tested varieties, it was decided to gradually test and promote untested good varieties. At the same time, in implementing the policy of running the cooperative diligently and thriftily, the opinions of veteran farmers were accepted, reducing production costs from 27% of the total agricultural income last year to 20%, and management costs from 0.45% to 0.235%.

    Because of the respect for veteran farmers, veteran farmers have played an active role in the rectification of the cooperative, which has been supported by the masses. Some experienced elderly farmers have been elected into the leadership and became cooperative member representatives.

    Now, a new atmosphere has emerged in the cooperative's production and unity. The enthusiasm of the elderly for production has generally increased, and the middle-aged and young people have also become more active, changing the situation of last year where "young people work, old people watch, and middle-aged people are neither forward nor backward." Young people have changed their views of veteran farmers as "ideologically backward and conservative"; the elderly, seeing that some young people do rough work and do not pay attention to quality, no longer passively ignore it, but instead persuade and educate, and take the lead in doing a good job in production.

### 倾听老农的意见

　　倾听老农的意见
    本报讯　河南省郑州市郊区庙李乡柳林农业生产合作社今年的包工包产计划，订得积极可靠，人人满意。主要原因之一，就是这个社注意倾听老农的意见。
    去年这个农业社的全年生产计划订得过高过大，不切合实际。当时，有很多人特别是老农不同意，但是社干部不考虑这些意见，反而认为是“右倾保守”思想在作怪。结果，原来的计划都落了空。
    在去年冬季的整社工作中，社管理委员会深刻认识了这个教训，重视了老农的经验。在发扬民主时，特别注意征求了老农的意见，并组织了访问老农小组。老农对生产领导和经营管理各方面都提了很多批评意见和合理化建议。现在，许多正确意见，都贯彻到1957年生产计划中去了。如计划规定充分利用水利条件浇麦五千亩，改旱田为水田五千亩。依靠社员积肥，少花钱买肥料。在推广优良品种上，除已经试验成功的普遍推广外，对未试验过的良种决定逐步试验推广。同时，在贯彻勤俭办社的方针上，接受了老农的意见，把生产费用由去年占农业总收入的27％降低到20％，管理费用由0.45％降低到0.235％。
    因为尊重老农，老农在整社中发挥了积极性，得到群众的拥护。一些有经验的老年农民被选入领导机构和当了社员代表。
    现在，社里生产和团结上出现了新面貌。老年人生产积极性普遍高涨，壮年人、青年人也就更加积极起来了，改变了去年“青年干，老年看，壮年不前不后在中间”的局面。青年人改变了对老农“思想落后保守”的看法；老年人看见有些青年人做活粗糙，不注意质量，不再消极不理，而是说服教育，并且带头搞好生产。
