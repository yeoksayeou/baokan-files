Xinhua News Agency, London, March 30th: Negotiations between Singapore and Britain regarding Singapore's internal self-government reached an agreement on the issue of Singapore's security and other remaining unresolved issues at a meeting on the 29th.

It is reported that an important event at the meeting on the 29th was the adoption of Singapore's proposal to amend the British proposal on Singapore's internal security issues. According to a Singaporean source, this means that the "consultative" foreign affairs council proposed by Britain will be downgraded to an informal committee, and all disputed issues regarding internal security will be submitted to the Defense and Security Committee.

The agreement reached at the meeting on the 29th also included issues concerning the protection of the interests of Malays and other ethnic minorities in Singapore in all aspects.

    英新谈判达成协议
    据新华社30日讯　伦敦消息：新加坡和英国关于新加坡内部自治的谈判在29日的会议上对新加坡的安全问题和其他一些剩下没有解决的问题达成了协议。
    有消息说，29日的会议的重要事件是通过了新加坡的建议，来修改英国关于新加坡内部治安问题的建议。据一位新加坡方面的人士说，这意味着英国建议成立的“咨询性”的对外事务会议将被降级成为一个非正式的委员会，而在内部治安方面所有的争执问题将提交防御和安全委员会。
    在29日的会议上达成协议的还包括关于保护新加坡的马来人和其他少数民族的各方面的利益问题。
