Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 30th (By our reporter Kong Mai) The second Indian general election has now concluded, except for a few regions like Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. The election results for most of the thirteen states have already been announced. The Congress Party has continued to gain a majority in the Parliament and in the legislative assemblies of eleven states, and will therefore form stable governments in the center and these eleven states. Prime Minister Nehru was already elected as the leader of the Congress Party parliamentary group on March 29th. He will represent the Congress Party in reorganizing the cabinet in early April.

These days, Indian newspapers have been commenting on some new political situations reflected in the results of this election.

	The "Times of India" published an editorial titled "Challenge to the Congress Party," pointing out that although the Congress Party has won a majority in the center and eleven states, its position has been weakened in many states. In addition to significant losses in Kerala, Orissa, and Maharashtra, the Congress Party's seats in its traditionally strongholds of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have also decreased compared to the previous election. In addition, five central ministers and deputy ministers, and thirty state ministers and deputy ministers lost their elections.

	The Communist Party of India, having secured an absolute majority in Kerala under single-party competition, will form a government in this state. It has also gained seats in the legislative assemblies of all states for the first time nationwide. Except for Andhra, Madras, and Punjab, the Communist Party of India has also increased its seats in the state assemblies compared to the previous election. In Uttar Pradesh, it increased from one seat to nine seats, and in Bombay State, from one seat to eighteen seats. The parliamentary leaders of the Communist Party, Gopalan, Mukherjee, and others, have continued to be elected. The Communist Party has consolidated its position as the largest opposition party in the Parliament. These facts are considered important events in Indian political life.

	The upper-level pro-American, anti-communist leaders of the Praja Socialist Party, such as Asoka Mehta, H.V. Kamath, and S. Das (who were originally members of Parliament), have all lost their elections. Nationwide, the party's strength is trending towards weakening. However, it has increased its seats in areas where it formed electoral alliances or other forms of cooperation with the Communist Party and other parties, such as West Bengal and Bombay. In Kerala, the Praja Socialist Party refused to cooperate with the Communist Party, and only nine of its sixty-two candidates were elected. Lohia, the leader of the Socialist Party, which split from the Praja Socialist Party, has also lost his election.

	Right-wing sectarian organizations such as the Jan Sangh and the Hindu Mahasabha have suffered defeats in the election.

	The main candidates supported by the pro-American groups such as the Democratic Research Society, the Congress for Cultural Freedom, and the Forum of Free Enterprise, such as Costa, have not been elected. The only one elected was Masani of the Forum of Free Enterprise, who ran from Bombay to the tribal areas of Bihar and was elected with the support of foreign missionaries from the Catholic Church.

	On the eve of the convening of the new Parliament, agents of the big bourgeoisie with close ties to the West have launched activities in the Indian capital, attempting to influence the government's domestic and foreign policies.

    印度大选结果反映出新的政治趋势
    国大党继续获得多数但在许多邦中有所削弱  
    共产党仍是最大反对党　右翼势力遭到挫败 
    据新华社新德里30日电　本社记者孔迈报道：印度第二届大选除克什米尔、喜马偕尔等少数地区外，现在已经宣告结束。十三个邦的选举结果绝大部分都已经揭晓。国大党在国会和十一个邦立法会议中继续获得了多数地位，因此将在中央和这十一个邦组成稳定的政府。尼赫鲁总理已经在3月29日当选为国大党议会党团领袖。他将代表国大党在4月上旬重新组阁。
    这几天，印度报纸纷纷评论本届选举结果所反映出的一些新的政治情况。
      “印度时报”以“对国大党的挑战”为题发表社论，指出国大党虽然在中央和十一个邦获得多数，但它在许多邦的地位都有所削弱。除在克拉拉、奥里萨和马哈拉施特拉显著的失势外，国大党在它传统的势力雄厚的北方邦、比哈尔邦的席位也比上届减少了。此外，有五个中央部长、副部长和三十个邦的正、副部长落选。
    印度共产党在克拉拉邦单独竞选情况下取得了绝对多数地位，它将在这个邦组织政府。它还第一次在全国所有各邦的立法会议中都获得了席位。除安得拉、马德拉斯和旁遮普外，印度共产党在各邦议会中的席位也比上届增加了。在北方邦从原有的一席增加到九席，在孟买邦从一席增加到十八席。印度共产党的议会领袖高普兰、慕克吉等人都继续当选。共产党巩固了它在国会中的最大反对党的地位。这些事实被认为是印度政治生活中的重要事件。
    人民社会党上层亲美、反共领袖如阿索卡·梅达、赫·夫·卡马特和斯·达斯（原来都是国会议员）等都已经落选。在全国范围内，这个党力量趋向削弱。但是它在同共产党和其他党派组成竞选联盟或其他合作形式的地区如西孟加拉、孟买等处的席位都有所增加。在克拉拉，人民社会党拒绝同共产党合作，它的六十二名候选人只有九人当选。从人民社会党分裂出去的社会党领袖洛希亚也已经落选。
    右翼教派组织如人民同盟、印度教大会在选举中遭到失败。
    亲美团体民主研究会，文化自由协会和自由企业论坛所支持的主要候选人科斯塔等都没有当选。唯一当选的是自由企业论坛的马萨尼，他是从孟买跑到比哈尔部族地区在天主教会外国传教士支持下当选的。
    在新国会召开前夕，和西方有密切关系的大资产阶级代理人在印度首都展开了活动，企图影响政府的内外政策。
