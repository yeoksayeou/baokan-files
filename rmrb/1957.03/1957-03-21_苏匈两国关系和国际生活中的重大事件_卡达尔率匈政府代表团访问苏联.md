Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 20th: A Hungarian government delegation headed by János Kádár, Prime Minister of the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government, arrived in Moscow on the morning of March 20th aboard a Tu-104 jet airliner.

Welcoming them at the airport were Soviet leaders Bulganin, Voroshilov, Malenkov, Mikoyan, Suslov, Khrushchev, Zhukov, and others.

Bulganin delivered a welcoming speech first. He said that the delegation's arrival is not only a major event for the Soviet Union and Hungary, but also a major event in international life. The delegation's visit and the talks between the Soviet Union and Hungary will further promote the friendship and cooperation between the people of the two countries.

Kádár then delivered a speech, saying that the Hungarian people expect that the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Hungary can be further developed through this negotiation. With the help of the Soviet army, the Hungarian people have crushed the counter-revolutionary rebellion and are now healing the wounds. This shows that any socialist country can rely on the assistance of other socialist countries, especially the Soviet Union. The delegation will hold negotiations with the Soviet government on various important issues and meet with the broad masses of Soviet working people.

On the 20th, Moscow newspapers published photos of Kádár and Dobi, their short biographies, as well as editorials welcoming the delegation's visit and articles on Soviet-Hungarian friendship.

Xinhua News Agency, March 20th: According to a TASS dispatch from Budapest: The Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government held a meeting on the 19th and decided to send a delegation to hold talks with the Soviet side. The meeting adopted the negotiation plan and the list of the delegation.

The head of the delegation is János Kádár, Chairman of the Provisional Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and Prime Minister of the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government. The members are: Dobi István, Chairman of the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic; György Marosán, Member of the Executive Committee of the Socialist Workers' Party and Minister of Industry; Endre Sík, Member of the Provisional Central Committee of the Socialist Workers' Party and Minister of Foreign Affairs; György Kállai, Member of the Executive Committee of the Socialist Workers' Party and Minister of Culture; Károly Kiss, Member of the Executive Committee of the Socialist Workers' Party; Ferenc Münnich, Member of the Provisional Central Committee of the Socialist Workers' Party and Minister of Defense; and Pál Bodor, Hungarian Ambassador to the Soviet Union.
