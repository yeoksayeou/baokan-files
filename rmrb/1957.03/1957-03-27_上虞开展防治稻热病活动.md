　　Shangyu Carries Out Rice Blast Prevention Activities

    This newspaper reports that in Shangyu County, Zhejiang Province, more than 60,000 mu of paddy fields suffered from rice blast last year, with an estimated loss of 4.67 million jin of rice. This year, the county leaders have learned from last year's lessons and are determined to take measures to eliminate rice blast.

    In order to strengthen the specific leadership of the rice blast elimination work, the county has established a headquarters, and each township is organizing a rice blast prevention team. On the 15th of this month, the County Party Committee and the County People's Committee issued a "Joint Instruction on Rapidly Launching the Rice Blast Prevention Movement" to each township, requiring the following tasks to be done well in a short period of time: (1) Replace disease-resistant varieties and gradually eliminate disease-susceptible varieties. (2) Properly handle diseased grains and grasses to reduce the spread of bacteria. (3) Apply fertilizer rationally, control the amount of nitrogen fertilizer, and promote the normal development of rice.

    After this instruction was issued, each township generally launched a rice blast prevention campaign after discussion. For example, the Xingfu Cooperative in Yue Dong Township processed 3,000 jin of "503" diseased grain into rations. Xinhua Cooperative has recently been carrying out seed replacement and has also proposed a plan to properly handle diseased grass in the short term. (Ye Ning Sun)

　　上虞开展防治稻热病活动
    本报讯　浙江省上虞县去年六万多亩水稻因稻热病危害，估算损失稻谷四百六十七万斤。今年县领导上接受了去年的教训，决心采取措施，消灭稻热病。
    为了加强对消灭稻热病工作的具体领导，县成立了指挥部，各乡正在组织防治稻热病大队，县委和县人委在本月15日向各乡发出了“关于迅速开展防治稻热病运动的联合指示”，要求在短时期内做好以下几点工作：（一）调换抗病品种，逐步淘汰感病品种。（二）处理好病谷病草，减少病菌传染。（三）合理施肥，控制氮肥用量，促进水稻正常发育。
    这个指示发下后，各乡经过讨论就普遍开展了一个防治稻热病的活动。如越东乡的幸福社将三千斤“503”病谷加工成了口粮；新华社最近一面进行换种，一面提出了在短期内处理好病草的计划。（叶宁荪）
