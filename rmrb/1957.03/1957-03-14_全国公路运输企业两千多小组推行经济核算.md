Xinhua News Agency, March 13th: In order to tap transportation potential and reduce costs, 2,023 groups in highway transportation enterprises across the country have implemented group economic accounting and individual vehicle economic accounting. In the past, some drivers in the motorcade of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Transportation Bureau were unwilling to use old materials, and some accumulated new materials. This increased the difficulty of material supply and affected the exertion of transportation capacity. After the implementation of group economic accounting, the drivers repaired and put into production all one hundred tires that had been backlogged for half a year within a month, which improved the transportation capacity of the entire team. In the past, the Xuchang Transportation General Station in Henan Province had lax material requisition systems. Regardless of whether the original parts could be used, they invariably asked to replace them with new ones. If only one part of a set of machine parts was broken, the entire set would be scrapped. This resulted in the failure to supply machine parts and vehicles waiting for materials for repairs. Since the fourth quarter of last year, they have implemented single-vehicle economic accounting and implemented a system of exchanging old materials for new ones. Workers generally pay attention to material conservation, and the efficiency of vehicle repair has also improved compared to the past.

Within six months, the Xi'an Automobile Repair Factory in Shaanxi Province repaired 646 old parts, saving more than 41,500 yuan and solving many difficulties in the supply of automobile parts, enabling many repaired vehicles to leave the factory in time to participate in busy transportation work.

    全国公路运输企业两千多小组推行经济核算
    据新华社13日讯  为挖掘运输潜力和降低成本，全国公路运输企业有两千零二十三个小组推行了班组经济核算和单车经济核算。新疆维吾尔自治区运输局汽车队，在以前有些驾驶员不愿意使用旧料，有些人积存新料。这样就增加了材料供应的困难，影响了运输力量的发挥。实行班组经济核算以后，驾驶员们在一个月内就把半年来积压的一百条轮胎全部修补好投入生产，提高了全队的运输力。河南省许昌运输总站过去领料制度不严格，不问原件是否能用一律要求换新，一套机件只坏了一件，就全部报废。因此造成机件供应不上，车辆待料停修。从去年第四季度起他们推行了单车经济核算，执行了材料交旧领新制度，工人们普遍重视了材料的节约，修车的效率也较前提高。
    陕西省西安汽车修理厂半年内修复旧料六百四十六件，节约资金四万一千五百多元，并解决了很多汽车配件的供应困难问题，使许多修理的汽车能够及时出厂参加繁忙的运输工作。
