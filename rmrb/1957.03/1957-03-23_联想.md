    Association
    Xu Xuanzheng
    In 1953, an old professor of philology told me that the ancient form of the character "祖" (zǔ, ancestor) was "且" (qiě), which some people thought was a pictogram of a memorial tablet. However, according to his research, it actually resembled the shape of the male reproductive organ. He explained it to me in great detail. This was a leading philologist in the country, a very upright person, even a bit feudal in his uprightness, and already over sixty years old; there was not a trace of jest in what he said.

    Therefore, I associated it with flowers. Botanists tell us that flowers are the reproductive organs of plants. However, throughout history, people at home and abroad have mostly appreciated flowers as beautiful objects. Even botanists, knowing what flowers are, outside the scope of their research work, when they see flowers, whether on trees, in fields, in vases, in paintings, or on women's clothing, only see them as objects of beauty, and may not associate them with their aspect as plant organs; even if they do, they may not further associate them with other things. Even human physiologists, when studying the lower body, do not necessarily have other thoughts.

    Why are scientists so lacking in that kind of "sensitivity"? Logically, scientists are the most imaginative. Association is what Pavlov called "conditioned reflexes" and "temporary connections," which is extremely important for understanding objective reality, acquiring knowledge, and expanding the scope of knowledge; it is an indispensable condition for scientists (and also for artists). However, scientists do not have the associative power to "see a person washing their face...and immediately infer that they will keep washing, and will eventually wash their buttocks" (Lu Xun). Why is this? I think the reason is very simple: precisely because they are scientists. They treat things with a scientific attitude; they strictly define the characteristics of objects within a certain range; they use their rich imagination in terms of the natural and inevitable connections between the objective object and its surrounding world; when conducting scientific research, they completely forget about "self" and do not involve any personal desires.

    Now that we have learned dialectics, we know that everything is in connection with other things, so we consciously pay attention to connections and greatly develop our associative power, which is very good. However, in reality, incorrect associations and all kinds of far-fetched connections still exist.

    There was such a case: Several cadres were chatting during their rest time, talking about "Romance of the Three Kingdoms." One of them said that Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang seemed to have a good relationship on the surface, but they had differences in their political lines. Zhuge Liang insisted on allying with Wu to attack Wei, wanting to ultimately achieve the unification of Han; Liu Bei, however, feared Cao Cao's power and only wanted to annex the weaker Sun Wu, and would be satisfied with dividing the world with Cao Cao. Somehow, this discussion was learned by the leader, and he became nervous, associating it with the fact that these cadres were discussing him, and discussing him was tantamount to opposing the leadership.

    There was also such a case: A teacher, when talking about laws, said something like this: "People have to eat and defecate every day due to the action of metabolic laws." This statement caused a great uproar, and under the leadership, people rose up to criticize it: saying that eating and defecating is a law is first of all absurd and vulgar; and talking about eating on the platform is promoting the reactionary and decadent vulgar idealism of the bourgeoisie; and the intention is to corrupt the cadres and disintegrate the revolution.

    Such a way of thinking is naturally rare, but in life, it can sometimes have a significant, albeit temporary, impact on a part of the cause.

    As for psychological phenomena such as being suspicious and fearful due to special conditioned reflexes in daily life, barking at shadows, being startled by bent wood, and being alarmed by knocks on the door, there are many. All these have a negative effect on life.

    Correctly grasping materialist dialectics and developing correct associative power is necessary for life, science, and art; while "far-fetched" associative power will only lead people astray and cause no small harm. Pavlov's theory once warned us that when thinking with language and words, "the countless stimuli of words enable us to move far away from reality, so we must often remember not to distort our relationship to reality."

    联想
    徐选牲
    1953年，一位研究文字学的老教授，告诉我祖宗的“祖”字，古时作“且”，有人以为是牌位的象形；但据他考究，象的其实是男性生殖器的形。他给我解释得很详细。这是国内一位有数的文字学家，人又是极正派的，甚至很带点封建性的正派，何况已经六十多岁了；他说的这话，丝毫没有一点玩笑在里头。
    因此，我联想到花。植物学家告诉我们，花是植物的生殖器。但是古今中外，人们对于花，倒是作为美物来欣赏的多。就是植物学家，明知花是什么，但是在他的研究工作的范围以外，当他看到花的时候，不论树上的、田间的、瓶中的、画里的，或在妇女的衣衫上的，也只当着美的对象看，未必联想到其为植物器官的一面；即使联想到这一面，也未必进一步联想到其他。就是人体生理学家，在研究下体时，也何尝引起过别的想头。
    科学家为什么偏没有那种“敏感”？论理，科学家是最富于联想力的。联想，就是巴甫洛夫所说的“条件反射”、“暂时联系”，这对于认识客观现实，获得知识，扩大知识范围，有极重要的意义，是科学家必不可少的条件（也是艺术家必不可少的条件）。但是，科学家竟没有“看见洗脸的人……即能推见他一直洗下去，将来一定要洗到屁股”（鲁迅）的联想力。这是为什么？我想，道理很简单，正因为他们是科学家。他们以科学态度对待事物；他们把对象的特性，严格地规定在一定的范围之内；他们把丰富的联想力，用在客观对象与其周围世界的自然必然的联系方面；他们在进行科学研究的时候，是完全忘了“我”，不涉任何私欲的。
    我们现在学了辩证法，知道任何事物是处在与别的事物的联系之中的，因此自觉地讲究联系，大大发展了联想力，这是很好的。但是，在实际上，不正确的联想，想入非非的种种联系，也还是存在的。
    有这样的事：几个干部在休息时间闲谈，谈起“三国演义”。有一个说到，刘备和诸葛亮，表面关系似乎很好，但政治路线上是有分歧的。诸葛亮坚持联吴伐魏，想最后实现汉的统一；刘备却惧曹操势大，只想并吞较弱的孙吴，与曹操二分天下，就心满意足。不知怎的，这一番议论，被领导人知道了，他就神经紧张起来，联想到这几个干部是在议论他，而议论他就是反领导。
    也有这样的事：一个教员，在讲规律的时候，说了一句这样的话：“人每天要吃饭、拉屎，是由于新陈代谢规律的作用”。这话，引起了很大的风波，人们在领导之下群起而批判之：说吃饭拉屎是规律，首先是荒谬和庸俗；而在讲台上讲吃饭，是宣传资产阶级的反动的、腐朽的庸俗唯心主义；而用意，是腐化干部，瓦解革命。
    这样的思想方法，自然是少见的，但在生活中，有时候却可以对于一部分事业发生虽然是暂时的，却很重大的影响。
    至于在日常生活中，由于特种的条件反射，疑神疑鬼，吠影吠声，见曲木而肉跳，闻敲门而心惊等等心理现象，是不少的。凡这些，对于生活，也起了消极的作用。
    正确地掌握唯物辩证法，发展正确的联想力，对于生活、科学与艺术，都是必要的；而“想入非非”的联想力，则只会使人走入迷途，贻害非浅。巴甫洛夫的学说曾经警告我们，在以语言、词进行思维的时候，“词的无数刺激，使我们能远离开现实，因此我们常常应当记住，不要曲解了我们对现实的关系。”
