Xinjiang's Autonomous Prefectures, Special Districts, and County Leading Cadres

Go Deep into Rural and Pastoral Areas, Sharing Hardships with the Masses

Promptly Solving Various Problems in Production, Greatly Encouraging the Production Enthusiasm of the Masses

(Our Urumqi Dispatch) Leading cadres at all levels in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have gone deep into rural and pastoral areas, promptly solving problems discovered in agricultural and animal husbandry production, and encouraging the production enthusiasm of farmers and herdsmen.

Currently, the heads of various autonomous prefectures, special districts, and counties, as well as members and secretaries of the CPC regional and county committees, are mostly in the countryside. They do not stay in township governments or agricultural cooperative offices but live directly in the homes of farmers and herdsmen. Of the seven standing committee members of the CPC Urumqi Regional Committee, five have gone to the countryside, except for two who are studying in Xi'an. Chu Nansheng, secretary of the regional committee, is now living in a farmer's home in the third district of Mulei Kazakh Autonomous County. All four county heads and deputy county heads of Urumqi County are in the countryside. In Hotan Special District at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains, more than 1,200 staff members, led by leaders at all levels, have gone deep into every corner of the countryside.

The integration of leaders who go deep into agricultural and pastoral areas with the lives of farmers and herdsmen has gradually formed a trend of sharing weal and woe with the vast number of cadres and the masses. Many district and township cadres in Hotan Special District have picked up shovels and carried manure baskets to work alongside the farmers. The arrival of Party committee secretaries at the homes of farmers and herdsmen has become a joyful event widely spread among them.

The deep involvement of responsible persons has not only strengthened ties with the masses and helped them understand their hardships and demands but also promptly solved problems in production. After Shi Luofu, secretary of the CPC Changji Regional Committee, and Ga Wenxiang, governor of Changji Hui Autonomous Prefecture, arrived in Miquan County, they found that some areas of the county were experiencing foot-and-mouth disease among livestock, and some agricultural cooperatives lacked food rations, fodder, seeds, and fertilizer, affecting preparations for spring plowing. After discussing the matter with the county's responsible persons, they immediately dispatched veterinarians and cadres to the areas affected by foot-and-mouth disease, taking urgent measures such as isolation, injection, and disinfection, basically eradicating the disease. At the same time, it was decided to allow mutual adjustment of seeds, fodder, and food rations between townships and agricultural cooperatives. After mobilization throughout the county, a wave of manure accumulation was also launched. Chen Baoshan, secretary of the CPC Urumqi County Committee, upon arriving at the pastoral cooperative in Maquan Gully Township, found that the cooperative members' enthusiasm for production was affected by the small number of livestock they were allowed to keep for themselves. He held discussions with the director of the pastoral cooperative and the cooperative members, resolving the issue of livestock kept for private use by the members. During his stay at the pastoral cooperative, he deeply felt that the frequent slaughter of livestock by herdsmen was affecting the increase in livestock. He then calculated the accounts of increasing production and practicing economy with the herdsmen.

In the past year, many responsible persons of special districts and counties suffered from too many meetings, too many documents, and too many office affairs. Since this spring, this phenomenon has been changing. Before going to the countryside, responsible persons at all levels made proper arrangements for various tasks, with only a few people remaining in the office to handle daily affairs. Many unnecessary meetings have also been reduced accordingly. The Party committee secretary returns once in a while to handle and arrange some important tasks and then goes back into the countryside. As for important or urgent matters or documents that need to be handled or reviewed by the secretary, they are sent to the countryside by messengers.

    新疆各自治州、专区和县的领导干部
    深入农村牧区与群众同甘苦
    及时解决了生产中的各种问题大大鼓舞了群众的生产热情
    本报乌鲁木齐电  新疆维吾尔自治区深入到农村和牧业区的各级领导干部，及时解决了农、牧业生产中所发现的问题，鼓舞了农、牧民的生产情绪。
    目前，各自治州、专区和县的负责人以及中共地委、县委的委员和书记，绝大多数在乡下，他们不住乡政府和农业社的办公室，直接住在农、牧民家中。中共乌鲁木齐地委会有常务委员七人，除二人在西安学习外，其余五人都下了乡。地委书记褚南声现在住在木垒哈萨克族自治县第三区的农民家里。乌鲁木齐县正副县长四人，都在乡下。昆仑山下的和阗专区，有一千二百多名工作人员，分由各级领导干部率领，深入到农村各个角落。
    深入农牧区的领导人和农、牧民生活打成一片，使广大干部和群众同甘共苦的风气逐渐形成。和阗专区许多区乡干部，拿起砍土镘，挑起粪筐，和农民一道劳动。党委书记深入农、牧民之家，已成为农、牧民奔走相告的喜事。
    负责人深入下去，不但密切了和群众的联系，了解了群众的疾苦和要求，还及时解决了生产中的问题。中共昌吉地委书记史洛夫和昌吉回族自治州州长尕文祥等到了米泉县后，发现这个县有的地区牲畜流行口蹄疫，有的农业社缺少口粮、马料、种籽和肥料，影响到备耕。他们和县的负责人研究后，立即调动兽医和干部，下到口蹄疫流行的地区，采取隔离、注射、消毒等紧急措施，基本上扑灭了口蹄疫。同时决定让各乡和农业社之间，互相调剂种籽、马料和口粮，全县经过动员，也掀起了积肥热潮。中共乌鲁木齐县委书记陈保山到了马泉沟乡的牧业社，发现社员因自留牲畜过少，影响了生产情绪，他和牧业社主任及社员们座谈，解决了社员自留牲畜问题。他住在牧业社期间深感牧民经常宰杀牲畜，影响到牲畜的增加，他又和牧民们算了增产节约的账。
    过去一年，许多专区和县的负责人，苦于会议多、文件多和机关事务多。今春以来，这种现象正在改变着。各级负责人下乡之前，先妥贴地安排了各项工作，只有少数人留在机关处理日常事务。许多不必要的会议也随之减少了，党委书记每隔一定时间回来一次，处理和安排一些重要工作，然后再深入下去。至于有重要或紧急的问题或文件需要书记处理或审阅时，则由通讯员送到农村。
