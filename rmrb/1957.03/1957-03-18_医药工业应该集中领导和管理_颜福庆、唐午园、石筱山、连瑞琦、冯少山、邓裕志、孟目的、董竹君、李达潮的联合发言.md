We listened to Chairman Mao's twelve-point report at the Supreme State Conference, and to the reports by Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li, and Vice Chairman Chen at the CPPCC meeting. These reports gave us great inspiration and encouragement.

We now put forward some opinions on the centralized leadership and management of the pharmaceutical industry.

We are striding forward on the socialist road, marching towards science! Marching towards the elimination of the roots of class and exploitation, backwardness and poverty! The people of the whole country are more closely united under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, carrying out intense work and creative labor, striving to complete the general task of the state during the transition period and to improve our country's scientific and cultural level! Striving to improve the health level of the people of the whole country! Therefore, the centralized management of the pharmaceutical industry, the weapon to protect the health of 600 million people, is a very important issue for the State Council to consider. A country with a health cause for 600 million people is unprecedented in the world.

In the past thirty years, the Chinese pharmaceutical industry has been under the long-term oppression of the three major enemies of imperialism, feudalism and bureaucratic capitalism, forming a deformed semi-colonial state that relies on imperialism and focuses on processing and manufacturing.

	The Development of the Medical Device Industry is Still Restricted

In the seven years since liberation, China's pharmaceutical industry has basically changed its semi-colonial status. In terms of utilizing the country's industrial base to develop the pharmaceutical industry, coordinating with health work, the principle of "prevention first, treatment second" and the direction of serving workers, peasants and soldiers have been established. In the pharmaceutical industry, the principle of "manufacturing raw materials first, preparations second" has been established, fundamentally breaking away from dependence on imperialism and achieving independence and self-reliance. Most medicines and medical devices have gradually become self-sufficient. For example, antibiotics, sulfonamides, biological medicines, large X-ray machines, and microscopes are all self-sufficient, and sulfonamides are even self-sufficient. However, the pharmaceutical industry is still managed in a decentralized manner, which restricts its development and, as a result, encounters many specific facts of insufficient internal connections and mutual contradictions among the people. For example, the Pharmaceutical Industry Administration originally belonged to the Ministry of Light Industry and now belongs to the Ministry of Chemical Industry. Although it is more reasonable than the former, it is difficult for the Ministry of Chemical Industry to focus on the pharmaceutical industry if it wants to develop it as a priority. The medical device industry used to be under the leadership of the Pharmaceutical Industry Administration of the Ministry of Light Industry. After several years of practical experience, it was believed that there were restrictions on the development of the medical device industry. It is now under the leadership of the First Ministry of Machine Building, but the First Ministry of Machine Building cannot focus on the development of the medical device industry, so it regards medical devices as an ancillary business. For example, the Shanghai State-owned Precision Medical Device Factory, formerly under the Pharmaceutical Administration, manufactured X-ray machines and various electrotherapy machines. Now, after being transferred to the First Ministry of Machine Building, part of it is used to transform instruments on machines, and part of it is used to transform motor materials, which hinders the development of X-ray machines and various electrotherapy machines. At the same time, under decentralized leadership, the institutions are huge, there are too many personnel, and waste is caused. For example, if the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Company and the Pharmaceutical Industry Company are merged to streamline personnel, at least half can be saved.

	Decentralized Management of Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine Also Makes It Difficult to Make Overall Arrangements

Traditional Chinese medicine is a valuable heritage of China's thousands of years of culture and a weapon for the Chinese people to fight against diseases for thousands of years. At present, the health security of more than 80% of the people in our country still depends on traditional Chinese medicine. The production task of traditional Chinese medicine was originally the responsibility of the Traditional Chinese Medicinal Materials Administration of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, and is now handled by the China Medicinal Materials Company attached to the commercial sector. Traditional Chinese medicine is a by-product of agriculture and also a handicraft production. It is an important weapon for people's health, not a general product. It is also not appropriate for the medicinal materials company to belong to the commercial sector. However, the management of Western medicine is in the Ministry of Chemical Industry, while the management of traditional Chinese medicine is in the Ministry of Commerce, and the management of medical devices is in the First Ministry of Machine Building. In this way, in terms of business, not only can the effect of unity and mutual assistance not be achieved, but also there are barriers to mutual learning and exchange of experience, and it is especially difficult to make overall arrangements for production plans. In Shanghai, according to the great achievements of the first five-year plan, we drafted the second five-year plan for the pharmaceutical industry. There are only materials for Western medicine, but no materials for traditional Chinese medicine and medical devices. This plan is only a one-third plan. Therefore, the management of traditional Chinese medicine, Western medicine and medical devices must be in one institution, so that, according to the principle of overall planning and appropriate arrangement, the unity of the overall and comprehensive viewpoint of traditional Chinese medicine, Western medicine and medical devices can be achieved. Last year, there were more than 50 kinds of traditional Chinese medicine out of stock in Shanghai, and even rehmannia glutinosa could not be bought on the market, because the cooperative only unilaterally paid attention to increasing grain production and ignored the planting of traditional Chinese medicine; the commercial department only unilaterally emphasized profits, lowered the purchase price of traditional Chinese medicine and ignored the needs of the people in fighting against diseases. Also, closing mountains to protect forests hinders farmers from collecting herbs, which affects the lives of medicinal farmers. These contradictions have caused a shortage of traditional Chinese medicine. This is a part of man-made cessation of traditional Chinese medicine production, and it is also a partial and one-sided view of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine production, which is caused by not unifying leadership. Looking at the phenomenon of non-unified foreign trade of traditional Chinese medicine, last year, musk was exported from Tianjin (5,500 yuan per kilogram), while Shanghai imported it (5,690 yuan per kilogram); another example is potassium penicillin, the import price of each bottle (1 billion units) by the trade department is 140 yuan (including customs declaration, transportation and inspection), while the production department has to calculate 1,040 yuan per bottle. These contradictions are caused by the lack of a unified leadership institution for the pharmaceutical industry.

	It is Recommended to Establish a Pharmaceutical Industry Department for Centralized Leadership and Management

Therefore, the necessity of the Chinese Pharmaceutical Company belonging to the Ministry of Commerce is also worth discussing. Medicines and medical devices are weapons for people's health care, and should be linked with the production department, which is not only good for overall planning and production and sales balance, but also for saving funds and reducing the burden on the people. For example, the price of 200,000 units of penicillin potassium salt per bottle to the supply and marketing department or forwarded to the national hospital is 55 cents, while it is 81 cents through the pharmaceutical company (71 cents wholesale), and one bottle of penicillin potassium salt increases the burden on the people by 26 cents after being transferred by the commercial department's pharmaceutical company. If other medicines are sold directly by the industrial sector, the burden on the people can be reduced by 18% compared to passing through the commercial sector. From the industrial sector's point of view, it is paying 18% more profit to the state, but more importantly, it is reducing the burden on the people. Therefore, we suggest that the pharmaceutical company of the commercial department should also be transferred to the unified management of the Ministry of Pharmaceutical Industry. In short, the decentralized management of the pharmaceutical industry is a disadvantageous method for the requirements of the development of the pharmaceutical industry in socialist construction and for the people's health care cause. Therefore, we suggest that the Pharmaceutical Industry Administration of the Ministry of Chemical Industry, the Medical Device Administration of the First Ministry of Machine Building, the Pharmaceutical Administration Department of the Ministry of Health, the China Pharmaceutical Company of the Ministry of Commerce, the China Medicinal Materials Company, the supply of raw materials for the pharmaceutical industry, pharmaceutical glass, the Pharmaceutical Industry Design Institute, the Pharmaceutical Industry Science Research Institute (focusing on intermediate product trial production) and the birth control drug production institutions (such as contraceptive ointment, condoms, cervical caps, etc.) needed by Chairman Mao's instructions on birth control issues should all be concentrated together, and the State Council should establish a Ministry of Pharmaceutical Industry to concentrate leadership and management, so as to achieve streamlined institutions, save manpower and material resources. This is not only of great benefit to the health care cause of 600 million people, but also of great benefit to socialist construction.

    医药工业应该集中领导和管理
    颜福庆、唐午园、石筱山、连瑞琦、冯少山、邓裕志、孟目的、董竹君、李达潮的联合发言
    我们在最高国务会议上听了毛主席的十二条报告，在政协会议上听了周总理、李副总理和陈副主席的报告，这几次报告给了我们很大的启发和鼓励。
    我们现在提出关于医药工业集中领导管理的几点意见。
    我们正在社会主义道路上大踏步地前进，向科学进军！向消灭阶级和剥削、落后和贫困的根源进军！全国人民更加紧密地团结在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，进行紧张的工作和创造性的劳动，为努力完成国家在过渡时期的总任务和提高我国的科学文化水平而奋斗！为提高全国人民健康水平而奋斗！因此，保障六万万人民健康的武器，医药工业的集中管理是国务院考虑的一个很重要的问题。一个国家六万万人民的保健事业，在世界上找不到前例的。
    中国医药工业在近三十年来，处在帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义三大敌人的长期压迫下面，形成于依赖帝国主义、偏于加工制造的畸形发展的半殖民地的状态中。
    医疗器械工业的发展仍然受到限制
    解放七年来，中国的医药工业已基本上改变了半殖民地的状况。在利用本国工业基础发展制药工业，配合卫生工作方面所揭橥的“预防为主、治疗为辅”的原则，和为工农兵大众服务的方向，在医药工业方面确定以“制造原料为主，制剂为辅”的方针，从基本上脱离帝国主义的依赖，做到独立自主，大部分药品和医疗器械逐步做到自给自足。例如抗生素、磺胺类药品、生物药品及大型爱克斯光机、显微镜都做到自给，磺胺类药品更做到了自足。但是医药工业目前还是分散管理的，这就限制了它的发展，而且因此碰到了许多人民内部的联系不够，互相矛盾的具体事实。例如医药工业管理局原属轻工业部现又改属化学工业部，虽然比前者合理些，但是化学工业部重点不在医药工业，想要重点发展就有困难；医疗器械工业过去属轻工业部医药工业管理局领导，经过数年的实际经验，认为对于医疗器械工业的发展有限制，现改归第一机械工业部领导，但第一机械工业部也不能重点的发展医疗器械工业，故将医疗器械看作附属业务。例如过去医药管理局所属上海国营精密医疗器械厂，制造爱克斯光机及各种电疗机械，现拨归一机部，就将一部分改造机器上的仪表，一部分改造电机材料，这样就妨碍了爱克斯光机及各种电疗机的发展。同时在分散领导下机构庞大、人员过多、造成浪费。如将上海医药公司与医药工业公司合并精减人员最少可省一半。
    中西药分散管理也不便于全面安排
    中药是中国几千年的文化宝贵遗产，也是中国人民几千年来与疾病作斗争的武器，目前我国80％以上的人民的健康保障还是依赖着中药。中药的生产任务原属中华全国供销合作总社中药材管理局负责的，现改为附设在商业部门的中国药材公司办理。中药是农业的副产品，也是手工业生产，是人民健康的重要武器，不是一般生产品，药材公司属于商业部门也不适宜。但是西药的管理在化学工业部，而中药的管理却在商业部，医疗器械的管理又在第一机械工业部，这样在业务方面既收不到团结互助之效果，而相互学习交流经验也有了隔阂，在生产计划全面安排上尤其感到困难。我们在上海根据第一个五年计划伟大的成绩拟草医药工业第二个五年计划，只有西药的材料，而中药和医疗器械的材料就没有，这个计划只是个三分之一的计划。因此，中药与西药和医疗器械管理一定要在一个机构里，这样才能根据统筹兼顾、适当安排的方针，把中药与西药和医疗器械做到全局全面的观点统一性。去年在上海中药断挡的有五十余种，连生地市面上也买不到，因为合作社只片面注意增产粮食而忽略中药的种植；商业部门只片面的重视利润，压低中药收购价格而又忽视了人民与疾病作斗争的需要。还有封山为了保护森林，但又妨碍了农民的采药，以致影响药农的生活。这几种矛盾造成中药的缺乏，这是人为的一部分中药生产停止，也是中药西药生产局部的、片面的观点，不统一领导所造成的。再看中药对外贸易不统一的现象，去年麝香天津出口（每公斤五千五百元），而上海却是进口（每公斤五千六百九十元）；又如钾盐青霉素，贸易部门每瓶（十亿单位）进口价为一百四十元（包括报关运输检验），而给生产部门要算一千零四十元一瓶，这种矛盾现象都是医药工业无统一领导机构所造成的。
    建议设立医药工业部门集中领导管理
    因此，中国医药公司属于商业部也有讨论的必要。药品、医疗器械是人民保健事业的武器，应当与生产部门连在一起，这样不仅对统筹兼顾、产销平衡有好处而对于节约资金、减轻人民负担也有极大的好处。例如二十万单位青霉素钾盐，每瓶价给供销处或转发给国家医院是五角五分，而经过医药公司就要八角一分（批发七角一分），一瓶青霉素钾盐通过商业部门医药公司一转手就给人民增加了二角六分的负担。其他药品如由工业部门直接出售也可比通过商业部门给人民减低18％的负担，这从工业部门角度来看是给国家多上缴了18％的利润，更主要的却是给人民减少了负担。因此我们建议将商业部门的医药公司也拨归医药工业部统一管理，总之，医药工业的分散管理，对社会主义建设中医药工业发展的要求，和对人民的保健事业是不利的办法。因此，我们建议将化学工业部医药工业管理局、第一机械工业部医疗器械管理局、卫生部药政司、商业部中国医药公司、中国药材公司、医药工业原料供应、医药用玻璃、医药工业设计院、医药工业科学研究院（着重中间品试制）和毛主席指示节育问题所需要设立的节育药品生产机构（如避孕油膏、如意袋、子宫帽等）等医药重点部门全部集中起来，由国务院设立医药工业部集中领导管理，达到精减机构、节约人力、物力，这不仅对六万万人民的保健事业有很大的好处，而对于社会主义建设也有极大的利益。
