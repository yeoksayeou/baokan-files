Xinhua News Agency dispatch: U.S. Vice President Nixon arrived in Rabat, the capital of Morocco, on March 1. The Sultan of Morocco received Nixon at the palace and held a twenty-minute secret meeting with him.

On March 2, Nixon told reporters in the Moroccan capital that he had discussed Eisenhower's Middle East plan with the Sultan of Morocco the day before.

Nixon said that although the plan "technically speaking" does not include Morocco and Tunisia, he believes that the plan "does not necessarily" have to be limited to the "traditionally defined" Middle East region. He said that Sultan Yusuf agreed "in principle" with the entire Eisenhower Doctrine, and was particularly interested in its economic aspects.

Nixon said that the two sides also discussed the U.S. air bases in Morocco, the possibility of U.S. economic "aid" to Morocco, and the Algerian question.

On the same day as Nixon's arrival, a Moroccan palace spokesman announced that the Speaker of the Moroccan Consultative Assembly and leader of the main ruling party, the Independence Party, Mehdi Ben Barka, had been invited to visit the United States in mid-March.

    美国在北非投下问路石
    尼克松同摩洛哥苏丹密谈
    据新华社讯  美国副总统尼克松1日到达摩洛哥首都拉巴特。摩洛哥苏丹在皇宫接见了尼克松，并且同他进行了二十分钟的秘密会谈。
    尼克松2日在摩洛哥首都对新闻记者说，他在前一天同摩洛哥苏丹讨论了艾森豪威尔的中东计划。
    尼克松说，虽然目前这个计划“从技术上说”不包括摩洛哥和突尼斯，但是他认为这个计划“没有必要”只局限于“传统意义上的”中东地区。他说，苏丹优素福在“原则上”同意整个艾森豪威尔主义，特别对其中的经济方面感兴趣。
    尼克松说，双方还曾经讨论了有关摩洛哥境内美国空军基地和美国可能对摩洛哥进行经济“援助”的问题，以及阿尔及利亚问题。
    在尼克松到达的同一天，摩洛哥皇宫发言人宣布，摩洛哥咨询议会的议长和主要执政党独立党的领袖麦迪·本·巴尔卡应邀，将在本月中旬访问美国。
