Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 10th: According to the Middle East News Agency, a Jordanian government official in Amman said on March 8th that due to Jordan's adherence to neutrality, Western countries have begun waging an "economic war" against it.

He cited as an example that the US Point Four Program agency has suspended most of the projects it had agreed to carry out with the Jordanian government, resulting in the unemployment of 15,000 workers.

At the same time, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East has notified the Jordanian government that it will close its technical office in Amman. The technical office has already laid off 75 Jordanian employees.

There are reports that some British companies in Jordan are liquidating, and Shell Oil Company intends to end the operations of its branch in Jordan on July 9th.

Xinhua News Agency, March 10th: Baghdad News: Iraqi officials announced on March 9th that the Iraqi Petroleum Company has agreed to loan the Iraqi government 25 million Iraqi dinars (equivalent to 25 million pounds). This loan will serve as an advance payment to the Iraqi government for oil extraction royalties.

These officials said that since the Iraqi Petroleum Company's pipeline through Syria to the Mediterranean Sea was cut, the Iraqi government has suffered daily losses of $700,000 due to its inability to export oil. The Iraqi government requested the Iraqi Petroleum Company to advance this amount to cope with budget deficits and other expenses.

    西方对约旦施加经济压力
    伊拉克石油公司贷款给赛义德政府
    据新华社开罗10日电　据中东通讯社报道，约旦一位政府人士3月8日在安曼说，由于约旦坚持中立，西方国家已经开始对它进行 “经济战”。
    他举例说，美国第四点计划机构把它和约旦政府商定进行的计划中的大部分项目停顿了下来，结果有一万五千名工人失业。
    同时，联合国难民救济及就业局已经通知约旦政府，它将撤销它在安曼的技术办事处。技术办事处已经解雇了七十五名约旦雇员。
    有消息说，约旦的一些英国公司正在清理，壳牌石油公司打算在7月9日结束它在约旦的分公司的营业。
    据新华社10日讯　巴格达消息：伊拉克官方人士3月9日宣布，伊拉克石油公司已经同意给伊拉克政府二千五百万伊拉克第纳尔（等于二千五百万英镑）的贷款。这项贷款将作为该公司预付给伊拉克政府的开采石油的租费。
    这些人士说，自从伊拉克石油公司通过叙利亚到地中海的油管被割断以来，伊拉克政府由于石油运不出去每天所受的损失达七十万美元。伊拉克政府要求伊拉克石油公司预付这笔款子，以对付预算上的赤字和其他开支。
