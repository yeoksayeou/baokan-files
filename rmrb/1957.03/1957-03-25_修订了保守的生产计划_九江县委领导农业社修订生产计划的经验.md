　　Revised Conservative Production Plan
　　— Jiujiang County Party Committee's Experience in Guiding Agricultural Cooperatives to Revise Production Plans
　　By our reporter Li Lianbin
　　As early as September of last year, the Jiujiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Jiangxi Province, began mobilizing the masses of farmers to start formulating production plans for 1957. By the end of the year, the production plans of the vast majority of agricultural cooperatives had been finalized. In early January of this year, the County Committee conducted an inspection of the agricultural cooperatives and found that the production plans of many agricultural cooperatives were too low, and the planned output of some cooperatives was even lower than the actual output of the previous year. For example, the Xing'ai Cooperative in Shili Township actually harvested an average of 490 jin of early rice per mu in 1956, while the planned output for 1957 was only 380 jin per mu, more than 25% lower than the actual harvest. Another example is the fifth production team of the Longmen Cooperative in Miaozhi Township, which actually harvested an average of 534 jin per mu in 1956, while the planned output for 1957 was only 464 jin on average. When Jiujiang County began formulating its production plans, it was precisely the time to oppose the "Leftist" tendency of rash advance in agricultural production. The inspection results showed that in the process of opposing "Leftism," there was also a tendency to lean to the "Right."
　　The main reason for this tendency was that some cadres and farmers developed the idea that "production has reached its peak" after the county's unprecedented bumper harvest last year. Jiujiang County's total grain output last year increased by 40% compared with 1955; cotton production increased by 138%. Some farmers said, "Last year's grain was borrowed from this year, and there will be no increase in production this year, but rather a decrease." Others said: plans are "written on paper, posted on the wall, planted on the ground, and harvested in the sky," meaning that no matter how well the plans are made, they are useless if the harvest is bad. Another reason was that some township and cooperative cadres, after opposing subjectivism and the commanding style of work, did not dare to take bold responsibility for their work, and developed a tailism of following the masses. For example, Hu Yexing, deputy secretary of the general branch of the Jianquan Township Party Committee in the Third District, led the formulation of plans in the Saiyang Cooperative. Fearing to commit subjectivism, he did not dare to offer concrete opinions, and more than a dozen meetings did not solve the problem, causing the work of formulating production plans in this cooperative to fall into laissez-faire.
　　In order to correct the above-mentioned tendencies and smoothly carry out this year's great agricultural increase production movement, the Jiujiang County Committee instructed the entire county to conduct a comprehensive inspection of planning work and revise production plans at the same time. The County Committee also personally grasped this work, and the County Committee Secretary and County Committee members went deep into the agricultural cooperatives to personally lead the members in formulating and revising production plans. In advance, a conference of more than a thousand agricultural activists from the entire county was convened to carry out ideological mobilization and exchange advanced production experiences, laying an ideological foundation for the work of revising plans.
　　Last year's unprecedented bumper harvest, can production be increased this year? The County Committee gave the farmers a big calculation, resolving this problem: In 1952, the year with the best harvest, neither drought nor flood, the county's total output only reached 106 million jin. In 1956, some fields suffered from drought, but the output reached 144 million jin, much higher than in 1952. Why? Because in 1956, agricultural cooperation was realized and large-scale technical reforms were carried out. However, last year was still the first year of cooperation, and there was not much work experience. This year, with last year's experience and lessons, the cooperatives will inevitably be run better. This shows that a bumper harvest last year does not mean production cannot still be increased this year; it also shows that a bumper harvest does not only rely on the heavens, but mainly on people.
　　The County Committee also summarized typical examples to educate the masses. The twelfth production team of the Yangping Agricultural Cooperative, led by County Labor Model Liu Yousong, planted 158 mu of rice, averaging 1,025 jin per mu. The average yield of rice per mu in the county was only 472 jin. It can be seen that the potential for increasing production in the county's fields is still very large. This made the masses realize that production has not reached its peak, and as long as they find the right approach and tap the potential, production can still be increased.
　　Accepting Last Year's Experience and Lessons
　　So, how should the plans be made?
　　The County Committee emphasized summarizing last year's experience and lessons, and basing the plans on a positive and reliable foundation. In terms of production guidelines, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of focusing on grain and cotton while simultaneously developing diversified operations. In the first half of 1956, the emphasis on agriculture and neglect of sideline occupations caused great losses to sideline production; when making plans for 1957, there was a phenomenon of emphasizing sideline occupations and neglecting agriculture. These two tendencies should be corrected and prevented in this revision of the plan. Last year, many places violated the principle of adapting planting to local conditions, and the work of expanding cotton fields was very blind. In the entire county, there were 4,000 mu of land that were not suitable for planting cotton but were planted with cotton. This year, this lesson must be accepted. After investigation and research, in addition to changing the 4,000 mu of cotton fields that are not suitable for planting cotton to other crops, the county can also expand the cotton fields by 10,000 mu. Last year, too much emphasis was placed on the state plan, and the needs of the masses were not sufficiently taken care of. This year, emphasis is placed on combining the state plan with the needs of the masses. For example, if farmers in many places ask to plant soybeans, their request to plant soybeans should be met. In addition, emphasis is also placed on tapping production potential and raising production increase targets.
　　Masses Decide, Field by Field
　　Last year, most plans were assigned tasks and targets from top to bottom. This year, emphasis is placed on going from bottom to top, from team to production team, from production team to cooperative, from cooperative to township, and from township to county. In the past, planting plans were based on numbers for acreage. This year, emphasis is placed on determining planting numbers field by field. In the past, plans were mostly made by cadres, and the opinions of the masses were rarely solicited. This year, cadres and the masses work together to make plans. Farmers in Longgang Township described the scene of making production plans in the past, saying: "Cadres make plans, and the masses don't speak." In the past, the Lion Cooperative in Longgang Township assigned tasks when making plans. The plans were too large, and Party members did not accept them. They were forced to accept them by using Party lessons. Activists who did not accept them were told that they would not be allowed to join the Party. Ordinary people who did not accept them were labeled as "backward elements." Plans made in this way cannot play a role in guiding production and improving the enthusiasm of farmers. This year, the County Committee especially emphasized that making plans should follow the mass line. As a result of doing so, the enthusiasm of the masses was brought into play, and the masses put forward many methods for increasing production. Taking the Xingxing Cooperative in Shili Township as an example, the original plan did not fully mobilize the masses, and the plan was to plant only 700 mu of late rice, 370 mu less than last year. This time, the plan was revised, and the masses were asked to decide field by field. In the process of revision, the masses not only considered the existing conditions, but also considered the possible conditions, and actively tapped the potential. As a result, the late rice planting plan was expanded to 1,490 mu. After the plan was finalized, the members actively worked hard to realize the plan, and the daily attendance rate was 100%. Now, the farmers' reaction to making plans is: "Say it in your mouth, decide it in the field, settle it in your heart." They regard the plan as their own goal.
　　Three Searches and Three Calculations
　　In the revision of the plan, in order to make the plan positive and reliable, the "Three Searches and Three Calculations" were also universally promoted. The three searches are: 1. Find the reasons for the increase in grain and cotton production last year and the planting experience of typical fields; 2. Find the lessons from last year's production decrease and failure; 3. Find the favorable and unfavorable conditions for increasing production in 1957. The three calculations: 1. Calculate last year's increase in income; 2. Calculate last year's deficit; 3. Calculate how to increase income this year.
　　The "Three Searches and Three Calculations" enabled the members to more specifically accept the experience and lessons of 1956 and clarified the goals of struggle. Before the revision of the plan, the members of the Lion Cooperative in Longgang Township reflected "three haves and three have-nots," namely: there are plans but no measures, there are indicators but no material basis; there are tasks but no confidence. Through the "Three Searches and Three Calculations," the members generally clarified that the reasons for the increase in production last year were: 1. Vigorously building water conservancy projects in the spring and increasing the application of fertilizer; 2. Expanding double-cropping rice; 3. Careful cultivation; 4. Doing a good job in pest control. The reasons for the reduced harvest in some teams and groups last year: 1. Insufficient base fertilizer and less top dressing; 2. Fields that should have been double-cropped were not planted; 3. Emphasizing sideline occupations and neglecting agriculture; 4. Not paying attention to late rice, and holding a negative attitude towards late rice of "harvesting if there is, discarding if there is not." The members believe that the favorable conditions for this year's production are: 1. After a year of running the cooperative, the members and cadres have gained some experience; 2. The members' enthusiasm for running the cooperative and working has increased; 3. They have understood the potential of the land; 4. They have mastered some advanced technologies.
　　Finally, the Lion Cooperative's total grain output in 1957 is planned to increase by 23.1% compared with 1956; the total cotton output is planned to increase by 44.8% compared with 1956; the total oil crop output is planned to increase by 52.82% compared with 1956; and the total sideline income is planned to increase by 80% compared with 1956.
　　Now the work of revising plans in the county's agricultural cooperatives has basically ended. On the basis of the plans of the agricultural cooperatives, the Jiujiang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has formulated the county's production plan: the total grain output will increase by 11.6% compared with 1956, exceeding the target assigned by the province. Cotton production will increase by 32% compared with 1956, and oil crops will increase by 88.63% compared with 1956. Cotton and oil crops also slightly exceed the state plan.

　　修订了保守的生产计划
　　——九江县委领导农业社修订生产计划的经验
　　本报记者　李连斌
    还在去年9月的时候，中共江西省九江县委会就开始发动农民群众着手制定1957年的生产计划。到年底，绝大多数农业社的生产计划都订完了。今年1月初县委对农业社进行检查，发现许多农业社的生产计划偏低，有的社计划产量甚至低于去年的实收产量。如十里乡星爱社1956年早稻每亩平均实收四百九十斤，而1957年计划产量每亩平均却只订三百八十斤，低于实收产量25％以上。又如妙智乡龙门社第五生产队1956年每亩平均实收五百三十四斤，1957年计划产量平均只订四百六十四斤。九江县在开始制订生产计划的时候，正是反对农业生产上的左倾冒进偏向的时候。从检查结果看出，在反左当中，又偏到右的一面去了。
    产生这种偏向的主要原因，是一部分干部和农民在去年全县空前大丰收以后，产生了“生产到顶”的思想。九江县去年粮食总产量比1955年增长40％；皮棉产量增长138％。有的农民说：“去年借了今年的粮，今年不会增产，而且要减产。”也有的说：计划是“订在纸上，贴在墙上，种在地上，收在天上”，意思是说，计划订得再好，年成不好也没有用。另一个原因，是某些乡、社干部在反对主观主义，强迫命令的思想作风以后，对工作不敢大胆负责，产生了跟着群众跑的尾巴主义。如三区涧泉乡党总支副书记胡叶兴到赛阳社领导订计划，怕犯主观主义，不敢提具体意见，开了十多个会也不解决问题，使这个社订生产计划的工作陷于放任自流。
    为了纠正上述偏向，顺利开展今年的农业大增产运动，九江县委指示全县对计划工作进行一次全面检查，同时修订生产计划。县委并亲自抓这一工作，县委书记、县委委员分头深入农业社，亲自领导社员制定和修订生产计划。事先，召开了全县千余人的农业活动分子大会，进行思想动员，交流先进的生产经验，为修订计划工作打下思想基础。
    去年空前丰收，今年能否增产？县委给农民们算了一笔大账，解决了这个问题：1952年年成最好，不旱也不涝，全县产量只达一亿零六百斤，1956年部分田受了旱，但产量达一亿四千四百万斤，比1952年高得多。为什么呢？因为1956年实现了农业合作化，进行了大规模的技术改革。但去年还是合作化的第一年，工作经验还不多，今年有了去年的经验教训，合作社必然会办得更好。这说明去年大丰收，今年仍然可以增产；同时也说明丰收不光靠天，主要还是靠人。
    县委又总结典型实例教育群众。县劳动模范刘友松领导的垟坪农业社第十二生产队，种植水稻一百五十八亩，平均达到亩产一千零二十五斤。全县水稻平均每亩产量只不过四百七十二斤。可见全县田地的增产潜力还是很大的。这使群众认识到生产没到顶，只要找门路、挖潜力，还是可以增产的。
　  接受去年的经验教训
    那么，计划应该怎样订呢？
    县委强调总结去年的经验教训，把计划制定在积极而又可靠的基础上。在生产方针上，必须坚持以粮棉为重点同时开展多种经营的方针。1956年上半年重农业轻副业，使副业生产受到很大损失；在订1957年计划的时候，又产生重副业轻农业的现象。这两种倾向，要在这次修订计划中注意纠正和防止。去年许多地方违反因地制宜的种植原则，扩大棉地的工作盲目性很大，全县有四千亩地不适于植棉而种了棉，今年必须接受这一教训。经过调查研究，除把不适于植棉的四千亩棉地改种其他作物外，全县还可扩大一万亩棉田。去年过分强调国家计划，对群众需要照顾不够，今年强调国家计划与群众需要相结合。如许多地方农民要求种黄豆，就应该满足他们种黄豆的要求。此外，还强调挖掘生产潜力，提高增产指标。
    群众订，逐丘订
    去年订计划大多数从上往下分任务，分指标，今年强调从下而上，从组到队，从队到社，从社到乡，从乡到县；过去以种植计划数字套田亩，今年强调逐丘订出种植数字。过去计划多由干部订，很少征求群众意见，今年干部和群众在一起订。龙岗乡农民描写过去订生产计划的情景说：“干部订计划，群众不讲话。”龙岗乡狮子社过去订计划分任务，计划过大，党员不接受，用上党课的办法强使他们接受，积极分子不接受说不让他们入党，一般群众不接受扣上“落后分子”的帽子。这样订出来的计划起不了指导生产和提高农民积极性的作用。今年县委特别强调订计划要走群众路线。这样作的结果，发挥了群众的积极性，群众提出很多增产办法。以十里乡星星社为例，原来订计划没有充分发动群众，计划晚稻只种七百亩，比去年少种三百七十亩。这次修订计划，逐丘叫群众自己订。在修订过程中，群众不但考虑到现有条件，还考虑到可能的条件，积极挖掘潜力，结果扩大晚稻种植计划达一千四百九十亩。计划订好后，社员积极为实现计划而努力，每天出勤率都是百分之百。现在，农民对订计划的反映是：“说在嘴里，订在丘里，安在心里。”他们把计划看成了自己的奋斗目标。
    三找三算
    在修订计划中，为了使计划订得积极可靠，还普遍推行了“三找三算”。三找是：一找去年粮棉增产原因及典型田地的种植经验；二找去年减产失败的教训；三找1957年增产有利条件和不利条件。三算：一算去年增加收入账；二算去年的欠收账；三算今年如何增加收入账。
      “三找三算”使社员们更具体地接受了1956年的经验教训，明确了奋斗的目标。龙岗乡狮子社在修订计划之前，社员们反映“三有三无”，即：有计划无措施、有指标无物质基础；有任务无信心。通过“三找三算”，社员们普遍明确了去年增产的原因是：一、春季大力兴修了水利，增施了肥料；二、扩大了双季稻；三、耕作精细；四、防虫工作做得好。去年部分队、组少收的原因：一、底肥不足，追肥少；二、应种双季的田没有种；三、重副业轻农业；四、不重视晚稻，对晚稻抱着“有就收，无就丢”的消极态度。社员们认为今年生产的有利条件是：一、经过一年办社，社员和干部都有了一些经验；二、社员对办社和劳动热情提高了；三、对土地潜在能力摸了底；四、掌握了一些先进技术。
    最后，狮子社1957年计划粮食总产量比1956年增长23.1％；棉花总产量比1956年增长44.8％；油料作物总产量比1956年增长52.82％；副业总收入比1956年增长80％。
    现在全县各农业社修订计划的工作已基本结束。中共九江县委在各农业社计划的基础上，订出了县的生产计划：粮食总产量比1956年增产11.6％，超过省里分配的指标。皮棉比1956年增产32％，油料比1956年增产88.63％。棉和油料作物也略超过国家计划。
