Let Everyone Think
    ——Also Starting with “Song of Razi”
    Yue Fu

    In January of this year, I went to Shanghai on business. One evening, I took some time to stroll along the Bund. Suddenly, behind me, I heard the sound of “Song of Razi.” A young man with a shaved head, wearing a short coat, walked slowly past me, singing, and stopped under a lamppost facing the river, repeatedly singing this song. His voice was beautiful and bright, with a slight melancholy, as if he had something on his mind that he wanted to express through singing. Soon, I left, but the young man was still singing... That night left me with an unforgettable impression.

    I didn't talk to this young man, and I don't know what kind of person he is, or why he sings this song for so long. But it made me think about youth, about songs, and about poetry.

    ＊　＊

    With this impression, I returned to Beijing, and at the same time, I read Comrade Yuan Shuipai's article published in the People's Daily. Recently, I also saw Comrade Li Ling's "Starting from 'Wandering Everywhere'" in the Beijing Daily. I also looked at Comrade Yao Mu's article published in the Liberation Daily. I feel that these articles have not touched on another important issue.

    Young people eagerly seek knowledge, need to study and work, and they also urgently need music and poetry. Young people not only want to listen to and appreciate songs, but also want to sing themselves; to use songs to praise life and labor, to praise the people and the motherland, and also to use songs to express their inner love, sadness, and melancholy... They have earnest expectations for poets (lyricists) and composers, and they are so respectful and grateful to the poets and composers who write good songs.

    ＊　＊

    If someone tries to obliterate the achievements of song creation in recent years, saying that no moving song has been created at all, that is also wrong. The problem is that young people need a variety of beautiful and moving songs with diverse themes and forms. Because, a few good songs, if you sing them today and sing them tomorrow, everyone will get tired of them.

    The lack of good songs is an undeniable fact. Therefore, it is perfectly understandable for young people to sing songs from the "May Fourth" era, to sing folk songs, and to sing foreign songs (of course, even if there are many good songs, these songs should also be sung). I think, from the other side reflected by young people's love of singing "Song of Razi," is that there are too few good songs. It should be said that this is a rather serious problem.

    ＊　＊

    No one has any reason to deny what is mentioned and pointed out in the articles by Comrades Yao Mu, Yuan Shuipai, and Li Ling. However, if we ignore what Comrade Li Ling put forward at the end of his article: How to further meet the needs of young people? Simply criticizing young people for liking to sing this song, or simply attributing it to the translators and performers singing the song with a somewhat "frivolous" and playful taste, or blaming the lack of music criticism, I think the problem is not fundamentally solved.

    Why can't our poets write beautiful lyrics? Why do many of our lyrics lack poetic elements, lack vivid vocabulary, and cannot stand alone without music? Why does writing lyrical songs (including love songs) form a set pattern?

    Why are the melodies of many of our songs not moving or pleasant to listen to? Why can't some of our experienced song writers write works that touch the depths of young people's hearts? Why are our themes relatively narrow and our techniques not diversified?

    The problem may be more than just these. In short, please poets (lyricists) and composers think carefully, is it just that criticizing young people for singing "Song of Razi" or "Phantom of the Opera" means that they have problems with their tastes and hobbies?

    ＊　＊

    One afternoon, in a literary teahouse, a singer met a composer and immediately reached out to him and said:

    "Write two songs for us, or we'll be unemployed."

    This didn't seem like a joke at all. The singer's voice was very sincere and earnest. Indeed, it is a very serious problem for a soloist to not be able to find songs to sing. His feelings are understandable. Although this is different from the lack of songs for the young masses to sing, the nature of the problem is the same.

    In this situation, the songs of "Wandering Everywhere" and "Ah, Girl" will not easily disappear for a while.

### 请大家想一想——也从“拉兹之歌”谈起

    请大家想一想
    ——也从“拉兹之歌”谈起
    岳扶
    今年1月间因事到上海，一天晚上抽空去逛外滩，突然身后传来一阵“拉兹之歌”的歌声，一个光着头身穿短大衣的青年边走边唱地慢慢绕过我走到面江矗立的一根灯柱底下，反复咏唱这支歌曲。他的音色很美很亮，稍带沉郁，仿佛有心事欲借歌声宣泄。不久，我走了，这个青年仍在歌着……。这一夜给我留下难忘的印象。
    我不曾和这个青年谈话，不知道他是什么样的人，为什么久久咏唱这支歌。但是却引起我想到青年，想到歌曲，想到诗。
    ＊　＊
    怀着这个印象回到北京，同时看了袁水拍同志在人民日报上发表的文章。最近又看到了北京日报上李凌同志的“从‘到处流浪’谈起”。再找姚牧同志发表在解放日报上的文章看了一下。觉着这些文章还没有接触到另外一个也是相当重要的问题。
    青年迫切地企求知识，需要学习和劳动，他们也迫切地需要音乐、需要诗。青年们不仅要倾听、欣赏歌曲，而且自己也想歌唱；借歌声来赞美生活和劳动，赞美人民和祖国，同样也借歌声来抒发自己心底恋情、悲伤和忧郁……。他们对诗人（歌词作家）、作曲家抱着殷切的期望，他们对写出好歌的诗人和作曲家又是多么的崇敬和感激。
    ＊　＊
    如果有人企图抹煞近几年歌曲创作的成就，说根本没有创作出一支动人的歌曲来，也是不对的。问题是青年们需要多种多样题材和形式的优美动人的歌曲。因为，少数几支好歌，今天唱明天也唱，谁也会腻烦的。
    好歌少，是谁也不能否认的事实。因此，青年们去唱“五四”时代的歌，去唱民歌，去唱外国歌，是完全可以理解的（当然，就是好歌很多，也应该唱这些歌的）。我想，从青年爱唱“拉兹之歌”所反映的另一面，就是好歌太少。应该说这是一个相当严重的问题。
    ＊　＊
    在姚牧、袁水拍、李凌同志的文章中所提到的、所指出的，谁也没有理由加以否认。但是，如果忽略了李凌同志文章中最后所提出的：如何进一步满足青年们的需要呢？单单指摘青年们爱唱这支歌，或者单单归咎翻译和演唱者把歌唱得有些“轻浮”嬉戏的味道，或者责怪由于音乐批评不力，我以为问题并没有根本解决。
    我们的诗人为什么写不出优美的歌词？为什么我们许多歌词缺乏诗的因素，缺乏形象的语汇，脱离了音乐就不能独立？为什么一写抒情歌曲（包括爱情歌曲）就形成一个套子？
    为什么我们的许多歌曲的曲调不动人、不好听？为什么我们的一些有经验的歌曲作家写不出打动青年心灵深处的作品？为什么我们的题材比较窄狭、手法不多样化？
    问题也许不止这一些。总之，请诗人（歌词作家）和作曲家仔细地想一下，是不是单指责青年们唱 “拉兹之歌”或者“夜半歌声”就是趣味爱好上有毛病？
    ＊　＊
    有天下午，在文艺茶馆里，一位歌唱家见到了一位作曲家，立刻向他伸出手来说：
    “给我们写两个歌吧，要不然我们就失业了。”
    这一点也不像是开玩笑，歌唱家的声音十分真挚、诚恳。的确，一个独唱家找不到歌唱，问题很严重。他的心情是能够了解的。虽然，这和青年群众缺乏歌唱有所不同，问题的性质却是一样的。
    处在这样的情况，“到处流浪” “啊，姑娘”的歌声一时就不容易消逝了。
