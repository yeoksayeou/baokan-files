Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 16th, TASS reported: The Soviet Foreign Ministry issued a statement to the press on March 16 regarding the plans of the governments of France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg to establish the "European Atomic Energy Community Organization" and the "Common Market."

    The Soviet Foreign Ministry pointed out that the practice of establishing these two exclusive organizations, the European Atomic Energy Community and the "Common Market," in Western Europe will bring dangerous consequences to the people of European countries. All participating countries in the European Atomic Energy Community and the "Common Market" are members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a military bloc. Obviously, all their activities will be subject to the aggressive purposes of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The implementation of these plans will inevitably further deepen the division of Europe, aggravate tensions in Europe, add many difficulties to the work of arranging economic and political cooperation throughout Europe, and create many new difficulties in solving the problem of European security.

    The statement pointed out that the intention of the ruling groups of some Western European countries to use the European Atomic Energy Community as a tool to control West German atomic energy production is unfounded. The experience of the European Coal and Steel Community has already proven this point. The establishment of the European Atomic Energy Community will inevitably remove all restrictions on West Germany's manufacture of atomic weapons, which poses a direct threat to the French people and the people of other Western European countries.

    The hope of some people in France, Italy, and other Western European countries that the establishment of the European Atomic Energy Community will reduce the economic dependence of Western European countries on the United States is also unfounded. On the contrary, their dependence on the United States will only be strengthened, because the fissile materials and atomic energy equipment of the member states of the European Atomic Energy Community are mainly supplied by the United States. Powerful groups in Britain, considering the consequences that participation in the European Atomic Energy Community would bring to Britain, oppose Britain's participation in this organization. The statement said that the plan to establish a European "Common Market" is also the same.

    The statement emphasized that the solution to the problem of economic cooperation among European countries and their cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy can and should be established on a pan-European basis, rather than through the establishment of new, exclusive organizations.

    In order to achieve this goal, the Soviet Union suggests utilizing existing pan-European organizations or establishing new pan-European organizations under conditions acceptable to all European countries (regardless of the social system of these countries).

    The statement recalled that the Soviet Union had suggested at the eleventh session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe in April 1956 that an institution be established under this commission to study the peaceful use of atomic energy and the conclusion of a pan-European economic cooperation agreement. These suggestions will be discussed at the twelfth session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe to be held on April 29 this year.

    In order to enhance cooperation among European countries in the peaceful use of atomic energy, the Soviet government also suggested discussing the following issues:

    Regarding the establishment of one or more pan-European atomic energy scientific research institutes;

    Regarding the joint establishment of enterprises producing atomic energy for industrial, scientific, and technological purposes.

    The statement emphasized: In this regard, European countries will have the opportunity to apply the Soviet Union's experience.

    The statement said: In terms of pan-European economic cooperation, the Soviet government suggested that the following issues should also be discussed:

    A. On cooperation in the construction of large-scale hydropower projects that are beneficial to many countries, and the construction of such projects should obtain the consent and participation of these countries.

    B. On cooperation in the development of European fuel and power resources to relieve the tension in power supply in many European countries.

    C. European countries concerned conclude agreements on measures to facilitate trade between each other.

    D. Mutual economic and financial assistance among countries to promote economic development.

    The Soviet government believes that these suggestions can be discussed at the twelfth session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.

    This statement by the Soviet Foreign Ministry has been sent to the embassies and legations of European countries in Moscow, the United States Embassy in the Soviet Union, and the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.

    苏联指责西欧原子能联营和共同市场计划
    建议建立全欧原子能和经济合作
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科16日讯：苏联外交部16日就法国、西德、意大利、比利时、荷兰和卢森堡六国政府建立“欧洲原子能联营组织”和“共同市场”的计划向报界发表声明。
    苏联外交部指出，在西欧建立欧洲原子能联营组织和“共同市场”这两个排他性组织的作法将会给欧洲各国人民带来危险的后果。欧洲原子能联营组织和“共同市场”的所有参加国都是北大西洋公约组织这个军事集团的成员国。显然，它们的一切活动将服从北大西洋公约组织的侵略性目的。实现这些计划，就必然会更加加深欧洲的分裂，加剧欧洲的紧张局势，给安排全欧范围内经济和政治合作的工作增加许多困难，而且还会在解决欧洲安全问题的工作上造成许多新的困难。
    声明指出，某些西欧国家的统治集团打算利用欧洲原子能联营组织作为控制西德原子能生产的工具的打算是毫无根据的。欧洲煤钢联营的组织的经验已经证明了这一点。欧洲原子能联营组织的建立将不可避免地会取消西德制造原子武器方面的一切限制，这就造成对法国人民以及对其他西欧国家人民的直接威胁。
    法国、意大利和其他西欧国家的某些人士指望建立欧洲原子能联营组织会减少西欧国家对美国的经济依赖也是没有什么根据的。相反的，它们对美国的依赖性只会加强。因为欧洲原子能联营组织成员国的分裂物质和原子能的设备主要是美国供应的。英国有势力集团考虑到参加欧洲原子能联营组织会给英国带来的后果，而反对英国参加这一组织。声明说，建立欧洲“共同市场”的计划也是这种情况。
    声明强调指出，欧洲各国经济合作问题的解决和它们在原子能和平利用上的合作能够、并且应该在全欧的基础上建立，而不是通过建立新的、排他性的组织的办法。
    为了达到这个目的，苏联建议在一切欧洲国家（不管这些国家的社会制度如何）都能接受的条件下，利用已经存在的全欧性的组织或建立新的全欧组织。
    声明回顾苏联曾经在1956年4月在联合国欧洲经济委员会第十一届会议上建议在这个委员会下设立一个机构，负责研究和平利用原子能和缔结一项全欧经济合作协定的问题，这些建议将在今年4月29日举行的联合国欧洲经济委员会第十二届会议上讨论。
    为了增进欧洲各国在和平利用原子能方面的合作，苏联政府还建议讨论下列几个问题：
    关于建立一个或几个全欧规模的原子能科学研究所的问题；
    关于大家合作建立生产工业用和科学技术用的原子能的企业的问题。
    声明强调指出：在这方面，欧洲各国将获得机会来运用苏联的经验。
    声明说：在全欧经济合作方面，苏联政府建议还应该讨论这些问题：
    甲，关于在建设对许多国家有利的大水电工程方面的合作，建设这种工程应取得这些国家的同意和参加。
    乙，关于在发展欧洲燃料和动力资源方面的合作，以解除欧洲许多国家在动力供应上的紧张状态。
    丙，欧洲各有关国家就便利彼此间贸易的措施缔结协定。
    丁，各国在经济和财政方面互助以促进经济发展。
    苏联政府认为，这些建议可以在联合国欧洲经济委员会第十二届会议上加以讨论。
    苏联外交部这个声明已经分别送交欧洲国家驻莫斯科大使馆和公使馆，美国驻苏联大使馆以及联合国欧洲经济委员会执行秘书。
