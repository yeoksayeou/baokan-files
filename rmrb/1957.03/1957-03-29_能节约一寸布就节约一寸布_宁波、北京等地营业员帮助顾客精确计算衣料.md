Save Every Inch of Fabric Possible
　　Ningbo, Beijing, and Other Places' Salespeople Help Customers Calculate Fabric Requirements Accurately

　　(Our Newspaper) News: In the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, salespeople in cotton cloth joint venture stores in Ningbo, Yuyao, Zhejiang Province, are accurately "estimating fabric" for customers, saving large quantities of cotton cloth. In order to learn the "fabric estimating" work, they specially invited local skilled sewing masters to teach "fabric estimating" methods and introduce knowledge such as the shrinkage rate of various cotton fabrics after washing. Some cloth shops have also vacated rooms for clothing production cooperatives to set up "processing business departments," with cooperative members stationed in the store to guide fabric estimating work and provide processing services for customers. Some cloth shops have consulted with clothing production leadership departments to jointly formulate the most fabric-saving estimating standards. After adopting these measures, general salespeople's fabric estimation has become more accurate. A set of uniforms can save four or five inches of fabric compared to before, and a set of uniforms for children around ten years old can save one chi (foot) of fabric. According to preliminary estimates, in Zhejiang Province, if each person saves an average of one inch of fabric per set of clothing, 2 million meters of cotton cloth can be saved annually.

　　能节约一寸布就节约一寸布
　　宁波、北京等地营业员帮助顾客精确计算衣料
    本报讯  浙江省宁波、余姚等地棉布合营商店的营业员，在增产节约运动中精确地为顾客“估料”，节约了大量棉布。他们为了学会“估料”工作，特请当地技术好的缝纫师傅授“估料”方法，介绍各种棉布下水的回缩率等知识。有的布店还腾出空房，供服装生产社设立“加工营业部”，社方派员驻店指导估料工作，并可代顾客加工。有的布店同服装生产领导部门协商，共同制定最省布的估料标准。采取这些办法后，一般营业员估料已较准确，一套制服可较前节省四、五寸布，一套十来岁儿童的制服可省一尺布。据初步估计，在浙江省，如果每人每套衣料平均节省一寸布，全年就可节约棉布二百万公尺。
