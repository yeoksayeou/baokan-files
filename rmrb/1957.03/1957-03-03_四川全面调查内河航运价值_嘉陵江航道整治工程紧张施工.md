Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, March 1st: Sichuan Province, which has the largest inland waterway navigable mileage in the country, is now starting with exploring the transportation capacity of existing inland waterways, and is investigating the navigation value of large and small rivers throughout the province.

The current purpose of the investigation is to identify rivers where channels can be opened up or the shipping tonnage of vessels can be increased in the future. There are mainly two categories: one category is rivers flowing through the resource-rich heartland of Sichuan; the other category is rivers connecting the interior and minority areas. Currently, seven survey teams composed of technical personnel from the Sichuan Provincial Inland Waterway Navigation Administration are active on the Fujiang River, Minjiang River, Qujiang River, and various tributaries of the Yangtze River. They collect information on the geography, geology, riverbed, flow rate, shoals, and socio-economic conditions along the rivers through field surveys and interviews with residents along the river. From November of last year to the present, these seven teams have surveyed a total of more than 5,000 kilometers. Now, the Sichuan Provincial Inland Waterway Navigation Administration has formed two more survey teams, preparing to explore channel conditions on the Jinsha River, Dadu River, Yalong River, and other rivers.

Sichuan Province currently has 12,000 kilometers of inland waterway navigable mileage, connecting more than 90 cities and counties, with the navigable mileage accounting for about one-tenth of the country's total inland waterway length. After the plan to survey more than 30,000 kilometers of inland rivers this year is completed, Sichuan Province will add more inland waterways.

Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, March 1st: The Jialing River channel improvement project, which started in October last year, has now entered the full construction phase. On the 1,600-kilometer-long waterway, more than 800 workers are working day and night to dredge channels, build dams, blast reefs, and set up navigation marks.

According to relevant负责人 from the Sichuan Provincial Inland Waterway Navigation Administration, the improvement project is to raise the channel water level and dredge some non-navigable channels. This project will be completed before the arrival of the flood season this year. At that time, the Jialing River will be navigable all year round, and the shipping tonnage of vessels will also increase compared to the past.

While improving the channel, the Sichuan Provincial Inland Waterway Navigation Administration also surveyed more than 30 shoals from Hechuan to Nanchong on the Jialing River and decided to use a combination of improvement and dredging methods to increase the water level of this section of the channel, which can only be navigated by wooden boats, in order to extend the shallow-water vessels traveling from Chongqing to Hechuan to Nanchong.

### 四川全面调查内河航运价值  嘉陵江航道整治工程紧张施工

    四川全面调查内河航运价值
    嘉陵江航道整治工程紧张施工
    新华社成都1日电  内河通航里程占全国第一位的四川省，现在正从发掘现有内河水道的运输能力着手，在全省范围内调查大小江河的航运价值。
    现在调查的目的在于今后开辟航道或增加船只航运载重量的河流，主要有两类：一类是流经四川腹心地区物产丰富的河流；另一类是沟通内地和少数民族地区的河流。目前，由四川省内河航运管理局技术人员组成的七个普查队，正活动在涪江、岷江、渠江和长江的各条支流上，他们通过实地勘查和访问沿河居民，搜集了这些河流的地理地质、河床、流量、滩险、沿河社会经济情况等资料。从去年11月到现在，这七个队普查的里程共有五千多公里。现在，四川省内河航运管理局又组成两个普查队，准备到金沙江、大渡河、雅砻江等河流上，勘查航道情况。
    四川省现在的内河通航里程有一万二千公里，连接九十多个市县，通航里程约占全国内河通航长度的十分之一；今年普查三万多公里内河的计划完成以后，四川省将增加更多的内河航道。
    新华社成都1日电  从去年10月份开始的嘉陵江航道整治工程，现在进入全面施工阶段。在全长一千六百公里的航道上，有八百多个工人正在日夜进行淘漕、筑坝、炸礁和设置航标。
    据四川省内河航运管理局有关负责人谈，整治工程是为了提高航道水位，疏浚部分不能行船的航道。这项工程将在今年洪水到来以前完成，那时嘉陵江将终年畅通，船只的航运载重量也将比过去增加。
    在整治航道的同时，四川省内河航运管理局还勘查了嘉陵江合川到南充的三十多个滩险，决定采用整治和疏浚相结合的方法，增加这段只能通航木船的航道水位，以便把重庆行驶合川的浅水轮船延伸到南充。
