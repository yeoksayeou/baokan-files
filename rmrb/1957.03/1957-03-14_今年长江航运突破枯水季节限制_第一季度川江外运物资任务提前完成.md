    Xinhua News Agency Report:

    This year, Yangtze River Shipping has broken through the limitations of the dry season.
    The first quarter's task of transporting goods from the Sichuan River has been completed ahead of schedule.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, the Yangtze River Shipping Administration overfulfilled its passenger and freight transportation plans for January and February of this year. Among them, the freight turnover completed in February exceeded the plan by more than 9%. The freight turnover completed in these two months increased by more than 25% compared with the same period last year. These are the best two months for completing the transportation plan and the largest amount of transportation completed in the dry season of the Yangtze River route every year since liberation.
    January and February are the driest seasons of the year for the Yangtze River, and also the off-season for Yangtze River transportation. In the past, after completing the busiest transportation season of the previous year - the fourth quarter, the employees of the Yangtze River route always had some slack emotions, and the plans for January and February of the following year were often not well completed. At the end of last year, the Yangtze River Shipping Administration held a series of meetings based on this situation, focusing on reversing this undesirable situation.
    In these two months, the Yangtze River Shipping Administration also paid special attention to the balance of transportation, strictly controlled blind shipping, thereby reducing the situation of too many ships arriving at the port, the port could not load and unload in time, and the transportation was blocked; in the ship scheduling work, it promoted the method of assigning ships to fixed routes for some bulk cargo, ensuring the balanced operation of about 40% of the ships on the entire line.
    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, March 13th: The Sichuan River shipping department, in the movement to increase production and practice economy, completed this year's first quarter's task of transporting materials out of Southwest China nineteen days ahead of schedule, on the 12th. In the next nineteen days, the Sichuan River shipping department expects to transport more than 100,000 tons of Sichuan grain.
    Starting from January this year, the Sichuan River shipping department has been trying to overcome the loss of transport capacity. In January and February this year, because the experience of safe navigation in the dry season was widely promoted on Sichuan River ships, the loss of transport capacity caused by marine accidents and mechanical failures has been reduced by 55% compared with last year, reducing the loss of transport capacity by more than 20,000 tons.
    Since February, the Sichuan River shipping department has also vigorously organized direct transportation and dedicated line transportation. Now there is a fleet of ships fully loaded with grain and live pigs heading directly to the Jiang’an Wharf in Hankou every day; a fleet of ships fully loaded with steel leaves Chongqing Port every other day. Due to the balanced departure of Sichuan River ships and the improvement of port loading and unloading efficiency, Chongqing Port has completely eliminated the phenomenon of port delays in ship departures. In addition, all ships operate at night as usual during the dry season, and the round trip between Chongqing and Yichang has been reduced from six days to five days, and between Chongqing and Hankou has also been reduced from ten days to nine days.

### 今年长江航运突破枯水季节限制  第一季度川江外运物资任务提前完成

    今年长江航运突破枯水季节限制
    第一季度川江外运物资任务提前完成
    据新华社讯  长江航运管理局超额完成了今年1、2月份的客货运输计划。其中，2月份完成的货运周转量比计划超过了9％以上。这两个月份完成的货运周转量跟去年同期相比，增加达25％以上。这是解放以来长江航线每年枯水季节中完成运输计划最好、完成运输量最多的两个月。
    1、2月份是长江一年中江水最枯的季节，也是长江运输的淡季。向来，长江航线的职工在完成了上一年运输最忙的季节——第四季度的任务以后，总有一些松劲情绪，第二年1、2月份的计划往往完成得不大好。去年底，长江航运管理局根据这个情况，召开了一系列会议，着重扭转了这种不良情况。
    这两个月里，长江航运管理局，还特别注意了运输的平衡问题，严格控制了盲目发船，因而减少了船舶到港太多，港口装卸不及而使运输阻塞的情况；在船舶调度工作中推行了对部分大宗货物实行定船定线的办法，保证了全线40％左右船只的均衡运行。
    据新华社重庆13日电  川江航运部门在增产节约运动中，提前十九天，在12日完成了今年第一季度的西南物资外运任务。在今后十九天中，川江航运部门预计还可以运出十多万吨的川粮。
    今年川江航运部门从1月份起就设法战胜运力损失。在今年1、2月份，因为在川江船舶上广泛推广了枯水期中的安全航行经验，由于海损机务事故造成的运力损失已经比去年减少了55％，减少运力损失达二万多吨。
    从2月份起，川江航运部门还大力组织了直达运输和专线运输。现在川江上每天都有一个船队满载粮食和生猪直开汉口江岸码头；隔天有一个满载钢铁的船队从重庆港开出。由于川江轮船的均衡发航和港口装卸效率提高，重庆港已经彻底消灭了港口延误船舶发航的现象。加上枯水期间全部船舶照常夜航，船只往返重庆宜昌间已经从六天减少到五天，重庆汉口间也从十天减少到九天。
