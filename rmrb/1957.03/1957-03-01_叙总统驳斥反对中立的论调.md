Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 28th - Syrian President Kuwatly stated on the 27th that the view that it is impossible to maintain neutrality in the current situation of "great power rivalry" is incorrect. He said, "Arab countries can certainly maintain neutrality without harming their independence."

The Syrian President made these remarks during an interview with reporters from the Middle East News Agency. He cited India as an example, saying that India is pursuing a policy of strict neutrality, but so far, it has managed to maintain its independence. He said, "In a world plagued by ambitions and desires to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, maintaining neutrality is difficult, but as long as the people of Asia and Africa resolutely advocate continuing to maintain neutrality, then they will certainly be able to continue to maintain neutrality."

    叙总统驳斥反对中立的论调
    新华社开罗28日电  叙利亚总统库阿特利27日说，有人认为，在目前“强国争斗”的局面下没有可能保守中立，这种看法是错误的。他说：“阿拉伯国家当然能够既保守中立而又不损害它们的独立。”
    叙利亚总统是在接见中东通讯社记者时发表这番谈话的。他举印度为例说，印度奉行着严守中立的政策，但是到目前为止，它仍然设法保持了自己的独立。他说：“在一个被干涉别国内政的野心和欲望所折磨的世界中，保守中立是困难的，但是，只要亚非两洲各国人民坚决主张继续保守中立，那末他们一定有可能继续保守中立”。
