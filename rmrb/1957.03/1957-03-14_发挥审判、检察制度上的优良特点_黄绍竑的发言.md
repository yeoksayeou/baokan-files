First, I would like to say that the Ministry of Public Security, the People's Court, and the People's Procuratorate have provided satisfactory handling and responses to the issues and opinions we raised in our judicial inspection reports on Shanghai and Zhejiang in the first half of last year. Some erroneous cases have been legally corrected, and workers and students who were dismissed due to the cases have been restored to their jobs and student status. Our reasonable suggestions have been adopted, and those that could not be adopted have been well explained. This proves that judicial work is improving rapidly and also proves the superiority of our country's people's democratic system, which is encouraging for us. In the second half of last year, I inspected the work of the procuratorial, judicial, and public security departments in Guangxi and Guangdong, and I also participated in the symposium of the political and legal group of the National People's Congress deputies and National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference members stationed in Beijing for inspection work. I saw and heard some good aspects and some shortcomings.

**Strengthen Public Trials and the Defense System**

I believe that to improve these shortcomings, the most fundamental task is to give full play to the excellent features of our judicial and procuratorial systems. We have a good system, but some judicial cadres have not yet thoroughly understood and implemented it, which has also affected the people's understanding and their inability to exercise the rights they should have under the system. Let's start with the trial aspect. Public trial is stipulated by law, but in some places, some cases that should be tried publicly are not, such as some deputies and committee members reflecting that civil cases in Gaoyao County, Guangdong, are generally not tried publicly, and 25 out of 26 wrong cases in the Hainan District are not tried publicly. This shows that non-public trials are one of the main causes of wrong cases, and cadres who violate the law by not holding public trials should be educated and corrected. On the other hand, I have not heard any defendants or people protesting or expressing opinions against non-public trials. Defense is a right granted to the defendant by law, but some cadres have not yet fully understood and implemented it. I have seen some interrogation records from public security organs, in which annotations such as "does not confess truthfully," "resistant attitude," and "quibbling" were added after the defendant's defense; I have also seen some prosecutors' indictments containing words such as "resistance," "quibbling," and "does not confess truthfully." Some courts did not appoint defense lawyers for cases with long prison sentences. These situations indicate that some cadres do not recognize or implement the defense system. Lawyers from the Guangzhou Legal Advisory Office raised the question of when the defendant's right to defense begins to be exercised. Can it only be exercised in public trials? Can it be exercised in preliminary hearings or interrogation hearings by public security and procuratorial organs? This is worth studying. I believe that, first of all, cadres should be educated not to mistake the defendant's defense as "resistance" or "quibbling," and not to unilaterally emphasize "leniency for confession, severity for resistance" and neglect the defense system. At the same time, the people should also be educated to exercise the right to defense granted by law and not to be afraid that defending oneself will be considered "resistance" and result in a heavier sentence. The widespread promotion of the lawyer system is a key link in the implementation of the defense system, and it is a division of labor in the judiciary, which can reduce cases and make trials more accurate. It should be accelerated. The implementation of the appeal system is relatively good, but there are still shortcomings in some places. Some deputies and committee members reflect that the Guangzhou Municipal Court does not pay enough attention to the protection of the right to appeal, and there are phenomena of disguised restrictions on the parties' right to appeal. According to my understanding, the parties' understanding of appeals is also insufficient, either because they believe that the government's handling is completely appropriate and that even if it is inappropriate, the higher authorities will correct it, or because they do not trust the intention of the right to appeal granted by law and believe that even if they appeal, they will not be able to obtain justice, or because they fear that appealing will be considered "resistance" and result in a heavier sentence. Under such circumstances, wrong cases are prone to occur.

The People's Courts of Guangxi and Guangdong provinces are serious about checking past wrong cases. It is said that joint offices organized by procuratorial organs, judicial organs, and public security organs are conducting inspections throughout the country. I think this measure is very good and very necessary. I will give an example to prove the serious inspection by the higher courts and the systemic problems mentioned earlier. In July last year, I received a letter from a defendant's family member saying that her husband had been detained in Longguan County, Hebei, for more than a year without trial due to a counter-revolutionary issue in 1955. I replied that I had forwarded the letter to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for handling. In November, she came to see me and showed me five reply letters from the People's Reception Office of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the Hebei Provincial People's Government, the Zhangjiakou Special Zone, Longguan County, and me. The general idea was: "Your letter has been received and has been transferred to a certain agency for handling," while the reply from Longguan County said that it was requesting instructions from the higher authorities. She was very dissatisfied with this kind of run-around reply and wanted me to find a way. I said I could urge the People's Reception Office of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to expedite the trial. After a month or so, she wrote again, crying and saying: "It may be because of the urging that the defendant was sentenced to eight years in prison. The defendant knew that the crimes written in the verdict did not conform to the facts, but he was afraid that appealing would offend the local court and cause misfortune, so he was willing to strive for a reduction or exemption from sentence in labor reform. At the same time, he suffered pain during long-term detention, and labor reform and imprisonment could be lifted, so he would not appeal." Not long after, she wrote again saying that the Hebei Provincial People's Court had revoked the original verdict of the Longguan County Court and changed it to education and release. Her husband returned, and she was very grateful to the Party and the government. This example vividly illustrates the serious supervision of the higher-level court, and it also shows the big difference in judgments between the lower-level court and the higher-level court—from eight years in prison to education and release. At the same time, it shows that the defense and appeal systems still have problems in remote counties, and the parties are afraid to defend themselves and afraid to appeal, and they dare not exercise their legal rights. If it were not for a higher-level court that seriously implemented supervision, they would not have received the state's lenient treatment or would have been wrongly buried.

**Replenish the Ranks of Cadres and Strengthen National Procuratorial Organs**

Let's talk about the procuratorial system. The powers and functions granted by Articles 3 and 4 of the Organizational Law of the People's Procuratorate of the People's Republic of China are very broad and very important. It is a working organ of the National People's Congress and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and it is the eyes and ears of the people. Its staffing is small, and its cadres are weak. Among the 875 cadres in Guangxi, 21 have a college education, and six or seven have studied law. They are not yet able to shoulder all the tasks, especially in general supervision. The procurators general of Guangxi and Guangdong unanimously believe that the cadres' level is low, their understanding of policies and measures is insufficient, and they have not yet achieved good results. However, in this situation, some events are still done very well, gaining the trust of the people and the attention of governments at all levels. For example, the Guangdong People's Procuratorate discovered that the People's Congresses of many counties did not hold meetings in accordance with the provisions of the law, and protested to the Provincial People's Committee, which immediately took measures to correct them. The approval rate for cases submitted by public security organs for arrest is only a little over 50%, which shows the seriousness of the review, which greatly reduces the phenomenon of wrongful arrests and also shows that the work of public security organs in submitting applications for arrest is somewhat rough. Among the 26 cases protested by the Guangxi People's Procuratorate, only one was able to maintain the original verdict, and the Provincial Court admitted that the quality of the protests was very high. The Guilin Municipal Procuratorate corrected the harsh penalty rules of the Hydropower Company that were not approved by the Municipal Government—a fine of ten times for the first offense, twenty times for the second offense, and sixty times for the third offense. Similar incidents across the country may be numerous and are worthy of attention. These facts show that if the general supervision work of the People's Procuratorate is done well, it can ensure the implementation of laws and policies and prevent cadres from issuing mandatory orders and violating laws and discipline. Its benefits are large or small, otherwise its harm is also large or small. If the supervision of criminal offenses is done well, it can restrict public security organs and courts, so that wrongful arrests and wrong judgments will not occur or will occur less frequently, and the basic rights of the people will be protected. The powers and functions given to it by law and its work are the most basic and occupy a vital position. Therefore, I hope that in the current movement to streamline institutions and personnel, we should still pay attention to strengthening the national procuratorial organs and replenishing their cadres. I suggest that the Supreme People's Procuratorate appoint some people with higher political levels (such as people's representatives and CPPCC members at the same level) to serve as procurators and be responsible for general supervision work.

**Strengthen the Publicity and Education of the Legal System and Promulgate the Criminal Code**

I believe that to fundamentally eliminate wrong cases: 1. We must strengthen the publicity and education of the legal system. Our newspapers and radio stations have not done enough in this work. I suggest opening a special column on the legal system in newspapers and setting up a legal system program on radio stations to carry out regular publicity and education. 2. It is difficult to have a unified standard for judging wrong cases. Often, the judgments in different places are different for the same case, the judgments of lower-level courts and higher-level courts are different, and the judgments of various judges are also different. The main reason is that there is no complete criminal law yet. Therefore, the promulgation of the criminal code has become a common requirement of all parties.

I saw fairly good labor reform prisons in Nanning, Guilin, and Guangzhou, but in the symposium, some deputies and committee members reflected that the labor reform work in some places was not done well, there were cases of abuse and forced detention beyond the sentence period, or excessive labor. People's letters reflected that the Yingde Labor Reform Farm also had the same situation. The conditions in detention centers in Nanning and Guilin are far worse than those in labor reform prisons. In the Nanning Detention Center, among the dozens of prisoners I asked, there were several who had been detained for more than a year without being prosecuted and sent to court for trial. One person reflected that his problem had basically been clarified long ago, and only a small problem needed to be investigated in Hunan, but there had been no reply for a long time, so it had been dragging on for more than a year without a resolution. It is even more conceivable that the situation in counties, especially remote counties, is worse, and these situations must be improved. I also suggest that the labor of prisoners should be used to carry out the basic construction of prisons and detention centers in a planned and step-by-step manner.

At the group discussion, some deputies and committee members reflected that some cadres who violated laws and regulations were only criticized and asked to make self-criticisms. Some reflected that some people received production and education disciplinary actions during the suppression of counter-revolutionaries without following legal procedures, which was illegal; others explained that this was an administrative penalty and not illegal. I feel that these different views are due to the lack of a criminal law and administrative disciplinary law. Therefore, in addition to hoping that the criminal law will be promulgated as soon as possible, we should also formulate administrative disciplinary laws as soon as possible. (Attached picture)

### 发挥审判、检察制度上的优良特点  黄绍竑的发言

专栏：

    发挥审判、检察制度上的优良特点
    黄绍竑的发言
    我先谈一下人民公安部、人民法院、人民检察院对于我们去年上半年视察上海、浙江司法报告中所提的问题和意见已获得了满意的处理和答复。某些错误案件得到合法的改正，因案被开除的工人和学生恢复了工作和学籍。我们所提的合理建议被采纳了，不能采纳的也有很好的解释。这就证明了司法工作正以很快的速度改进，也证明了我国人民民主制度的优越性，这是值得我们鼓舞的。我去年下半年视察了广西、广东的检察、审判、公安部分的工作，并且参加了驻京全国人民代表和全国政协委员视察工作政法组的座谈会，看到了、听到了好的方面一些情况和缺点方面的一些情况。
    加强公开审判和辩护制度
    我认为要改进这些缺点，最基本的工作是如何发挥我们审判、检察制度上的优良特点。我们有良好的制度，但是有些司法干部还未能彻底地认识和执行，同时也影响了人民方面的认识和不能运用制度上所应有的权利。先就审判方面来说吧，公开审判是法律所规定的，但某些地方某些应公开审判的案件尚没有公开，如有的代表、委员反映广东高要县民事案件一般不公开审理，海南区二十六件错案有二十五件是不公开审理的。这就说明不公开审理是错案发生主要原因之一，对违反法律规定不公开审判的干部，应加教育纠正。另一方面，我还没有听见过被告或人民群众对不公开审判提出抗议或意见。辩护是法律上给予被告的权利，某些干部也尚未很好的认识和执行。我看到过一些公安机关的审讯记录，对被告的抗辩后加了“不坦白认罪”“态度抗拒”“狡辩”的按语；也看到过有些检察员的起诉书里也有 “抗拒”“狡辩”“不坦白认罪”的字样。有些法院对判长期徒刑的案件没有指定辩护律师，这些情况表示了某些干部对辩护制度没有认识、没有执行。广州法律顾问处律师们提出：被告辩护权在什么时候开始行使的问题，在公开审判才能行使呢？在预审庭中或公安、检察机关的审讯庭中是否可以行使呢？是很值得研究的。我认为首先要教育干部不要把被告的抗辩误认为“抗拒”“狡辩”，不要片面地强调“抗拒从严”“坦白从宽”而把辩护制度忽视了。同时也要教育人民实行法律所付与的辩护权利，不要怕辩护就成为“抗拒”而被加重的判刑。律师制度的普遍推行是执行辩护制度的主要环节，并且是司法的分工，可以减少案件，可以使审判更加正确，应该加紧推广。上诉制度的执行比较好，但有些地方尚有缺点，有的代表、委员反映广州市法院对上诉权利的保护不够重视，有变相限制当事人上诉的现象。照我的了解，当事人对上诉的认识也不够，或者是信赖政府处理是完全得当的，即或不得当上级也会纠正的，或者是不信任法律给予的上诉权利的用意，即使上诉也无法伸冤，或者恐上诉成为“抗拒”而被加刑。在这样的情形之下错案是容易发生的。
    广西、广东省人民法院对于过去错案的检查是认真的，据说全国各地都由检察机关、司法机关、公安机关组织联合办公室进行检查。我认为这个措施是十分好、十分必要的，我举一个例子来证明高级法院的认真检查和前面所说的制度问题。去年7月间我接到一个被告家属来信说她的爱人1955年因肃反问题被押在河北龙关县一年多没有审判，我答复她已将信件转送人大常委会处理。11月她来见我，把人大常委会人民接待室、河北省人民政府、张家口专区、龙关县连我的五封回信给我看，大意都是说：“你的来信收到了，已转某机关处理”，而龙关县的复信说是请示上级处理。她很不满意这种兜圈子的复信，要我想办法，我说可以向人大常委会人民接待室催请快些审理。过了个把月又来信哭诉说：“可能是因为催请，被告被判处八年徒刑，被告明知判词所写的罪行与事实不符，但怕上诉会触怒当地法院而招不测，甘愿在劳改中争取减刑或免刑，同时在长期扣押中受了痛苦，劳改服刑可以解除，因此就不上诉了。”不久又来信说，河北省人民法院撤销龙关县法院原判改为教育释放，她的爱人回来了，她非常感激党和政府。这个例子生动地说明了上级法院的认真监督，也说明了下级法院与上级法院的判决差得很大——从八年徒刑改为教育释放，同时更说明辩护和上诉制度在边远的县里尚有问题，当事人怕辩护、怕上诉，尚不敢运用法律上的权利。如果不是遇到认真实行监督的高级法院的话，就会得不到国家宽大处理，或者是冤沉海底了。
    充实干部力量，加强全国检察机构
    再谈一谈检察制度问题，中华人民共和国人民检察院组织法第三、第四两条所付与的职权是非常广泛非常重大的，它是全国人民代表大会、全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作机关，是人民的耳目。它的编制小，干部弱。广西八百七十五个干部中大学文化程度的二十一人，学过法律的六、七个人。尚不能肩负所有的任务，尤其是对一般监督工作，广西、广东检察长们一致认为干部水平低，对政策措施上的认识不够，还没有很好的成绩。但在这种情形之下有些事件仍然做得很出色，获得人民的信仰和各级政府的重视。如广东人民检察院发现好些县的人民代表大会没有依据法律规定开会，向省人民委员会提出了抗议，省人民委员会随即采取措施加以纠正。对公安机关提请逮捕的案件批准的约百分之五十多一点点，可见审核的认真，大大减少了错捕的现象，同时也看出公安机关提请逮捕的工作做得粗糙一些。广西人民检察院抗议的二十六件案子，只有一件能维持原判的，省法院承认抗议的质量很高。桂林市检察院纠正了水电公司未经市政府核准的苛刻罚则——第一次罚十倍，第二次罚二十倍，第三次罚六十倍。全国类似的事件可能还不在少数，是值得注意的。这些事实说明了如果人民检察院的一般监督工作做得好，就能保证法律政策的实施，防止干部的强迫命令、违法乱纪，它的利益是或大或小的面，否则它为害也是或大或小的面。如果刑事犯罪的监督工作做得好，就可制约公安机关和法院，不致发生或少发生错捕错判，保障人民的基本权利，法律上所付予它的职权和工作，都是最基本的居冲要地位的。因此，我希望在目前精简机构人员的运动下，仍然要注意加强全国的检察机构，充实它的干部。我建议最高人民检察院任命一些政治水平更高的人（如同级的人民代表、政协委员）充当检察员，负责一般监督工作。
    加强法制的宣传教育，颁布刑法典
    我认为要根本上消除错案：一、必须加强法制的宣传教育，我们的报纸和广播电台对这工作做得不够，我建议在报纸上开辟一个法制专栏，广播电台设一个法制节目，作定期的宣传教育。二、错案的看法难有统一的标准，往往有同一案情各地的判决不同，下级法院上级法院的判决不同，各个审判员的判决也有不同。最主要的原因是尚未有完整的刑法。因此，刑法典的颁布就成为各方面的共同要求。
    我在南宁、桂林、广州看到相当好的劳改监狱，但在座谈会中有的代表、委员反映某些地方劳改工作做得不好，有虐待和刑满强留不放，或过度劳动的情事，人民来信反映英德劳改农场也有同样的情况。南宁、桂林的拘留所情况远不如劳改监狱好。南宁拘留所几十犯人中就我问过的，就有好几个拘留一年以上没有起诉送法院审判的。有一个反映他的问题基本上早已清楚了，只有一点小问题要向湖南调查，久不答复因而拖了一年多尚未解决。更可以想见县尤其边远的县情形更坏，这些情况必须改进。我并建议应该利用犯人的劳动有计划、有步骤地进行监所的基本建设。
    在小组座谈会上有的代表、委员反映某些违法乱纪干部仅是批评、检讨了事。有的反映在肃反中某些人受到生产教养处分，没有按照法律手续是违法的；有的解释这是一种行政处分并不违法。我觉得这些不同的看法，都是由于没有刑法和行政方面的惩戒法的原故。因此，除希望刑法早日颁布外，并从速制定行政方面的惩戒法。（附图片）
