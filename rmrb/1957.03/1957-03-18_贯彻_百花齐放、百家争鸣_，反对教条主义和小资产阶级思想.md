    Implement the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," Oppose Dogmatism and Petty-Bourgeois Ideology
    Mao Dun
    Approximately eight months ago, the Party Central Committee put forward the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend." Eight months is truly too short a time for such an academic and literary activity that inherits the past and ushers in the future, is grand in scale, extracts the essence, and is full of vigor, and it shouldn't be expected to yield abundant and brilliant fruits already. However, despite this short period, not only has a scene of myriad renewals appeared, but also the first batch of commendable harvests has already been achieved. Dogmatism and sectarianism, which are harmful to academic research and literary creation, have been further overcome.
    Naturally, things won't be as easy and smooth as some people imagine. "Letting go" and "contending" are still not fully expressed, and right-leaning thoughts have appeared in the process of opposing dogmatism. This includes uncritically negating past achievements, becoming lazy and even厌恶 in the study of Marxism-Leninism, emphasizing the particularity of literature and art, and weakening the ideological nature of literature and art under the pretext of this particularity, even to the point of questioning the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and questioning the guiding role of the Marxist worldview in creation.
    In literary creation, works have appeared that "write about love for the sake of love," even with a considerable amount of eroticism, as well as works that are self-pitying, appreciate "trivial matters of daily life," and have almost no ideological content.
    There have also been strange arguments that the root of formulaic and conceptualized literary works lies in the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers.
    These erroneous thoughts, the "weeds" we dislike, and the harmful "poisonous weeds," are all reflections of petty-bourgeois ideology. Since the petty bourgeoisie is an objective reality, its ideology will inevitably express itself stubbornly. We should not turn a blind eye, nor should we be alarmed. Our literary and artistic activities are basically healthy and developing forward.
    However, since right-leaning thoughts have appeared, to a greater or lesser extent, in various departments of literature and art, they naturally attract widespread attention and even concern. There are probably quite a few people who hold worried or even alarmed feelings. The "Several Opinions on Current Literary and Artistic Work" by Comrades Chen Qitong and others is quite representative. I sincerely admire their unwavering devotion to defending the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, defending socialist culture, and engaging in ideological struggle against petty-bourgeois ideology. However, their article lacks persuasiveness, the method of criticism is dogmatic, and the result is not only ineffective in combating petty-bourgeois ideology, but also gives readers the impression that "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" has more disadvantages than advantages, and pours cold water on the vast number of intellectuals who are encouraged and active under the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend."
    Comrades Chen Qitong and others did not make a correct estimate of the comparison of strength between the active socialist factors and the backward petty-bourgeois factors in the arts. They saw the "weeds" or "poisonous weeds" blooming among the "hundred flowers" since June last year, and the strange arguments and muddled theories emerging among the "hundred schools," and then, without analysis, said that "the combat effectiveness of literature and art has weakened, the face of the times has become blurred, the voice of the times has become low, and the brilliance of socialist construction has dimmed in the mirror of literature and art," which is not in accordance with the facts.
    The article by Comrades Chen Qitong and others mentioned some important issues in literary and artistic work, such as "domestic affairs and love affairs" in terms of subject matter, such as the problem of formulaization and conceptualization, such as the excavation and arrangement of traditional drama repertoire, and the discussion of socialist realism, and so on. But regrettably, the article by the four comrades simplified these problems, did not comprehensively analyze the content of these problems, and easily negated opinions that differed from theirs: this is not convincing. Such a method of criticism cannot but be said to be dogmatic. They believe that some comrades today's opinions on socialist realism are "skepticism, cancellationism, and products of petty-bourgeois artistic thought" - this conclusion is also difficult to agree with.
    Comrades Chen Qitong and others oppose petty-bourgeois artistic thought. I extremely support this proposition of theirs, and I believe that this should be an important topic on our ideological front of literature and art. But when we carry out this ideological struggle, we must be careful to guard against returning to the old tune of dogmatism, and at the same time vigorously oppose dogmatism; simply adopting the method of prohibiting "letting go" and "contending" cannot solve the problem. The elimination of petty-bourgeois ideology is a long-term, complex, and meticulous task. Our attitude towards criticism should be to start from the desire for unity, and through criticism and struggle, achieve new unity on a new basis; our working method should be to let everyone "let go" and "contend," and carry out free discussion, and strengthen Marxist-Leninist ideological education through discussion. We should encourage and help literary and artistic workers to go deep into life, throw themselves into struggle, participate in socialist construction, and transform their thinking for the better.
    Now there are also such arguments: life experience is a writer's most important asset, and writing truthfully is the "soul" of the work. It seems that this is not wrong. However, behind such arguments there is a "theory" that learning Marxism-Leninism is unimportant and that the ideological transformation of writers is unnecessary. In other words, it is also believed that the Marxist worldview is not necessary for writers. Such a so-called theory is wrong. Because when a writer does not yet have a Marxist worldview, there is indeed another worldview in his mind (a bourgeois ideology or a non-proletarian worldview mixed with feudal thoughts), and when he observes life and artistic practice, this original worldview plays a "guiding" role. Isn't this very dangerous?
    I believe that the Marxist worldview is something that we who engage in creation must acquire. We hope that everyone has this magic weapon. But we must also make it clear that this matter cannot be done well if it is not on the basis of the writer's own volition, through study and life practice, plus the collective's meticulous and patient help. If we demand today that our writers must first have a Marxist worldview before writing, that is unrealistic and too demanding. And if a writer (even out of sincerity) first estimates whether his worldview is Marxist enough and then starts writing, then he will either be self-deceiving and self-confident, or he will hesitate and wander. The Marxist worldview is not a discipline, not something that can be graduated from after reading a few books and being able to recite a set of theories. How can a writer be considered to have a Marxist worldview? It depends on whether he can see social reality far and deep, grasp the key issues, and grasp the essence of social development. And whether he has this ability can only be measured from his works. Therefore, the writer's own method of effort is to constantly study, constantly experience life, participate in struggle, and constantly write. The method of helping writers is to conduct scientific criticism of his works. On the other hand, whether a critic has mastered Marxist literary theory can only be measured from his critical articles. In addition to study and writing, the critic's own method of effort should also include broad knowledge of life. The method of helping critics is to conduct criticism of the criticism of his articles. Do not be afraid of "letting go" of bad things, but conduct timely, kind, meticulous, profound, and scientific criticism; do not be afraid of "contending" with unpleasant sounds, but conduct criticism of criticism and launch free discussions.
    Whether it is criticism of works or criticism of criticism, what is useless and harmful is always dogmatic criticism.
    Opposing dogmatism and opposing right-leaning thoughts at the same time: this is a struggle on two fronts. This is a long-term and meticulous task; we cannot think that a single movement can solve the problem, but we must do a little bit at any time and anywhere we see it. But there should also be a comprehensive long-term plan. My personal opinion is that we should still advance in three aspects at the same time, that is, strengthening the study of Marxism-Leninism, conducting artistic practice in a planned way, and experiencing life in a planned way - learning from the people and learning from society. We have had a lot of experience in these three aspects of work, with achievements and shortcomings. The biggest shortcomings, I think, are formalism (some but not most of the study and life experience), dogmatism (mainly in the aspect of study), and generalization (the method of arranging study and the method of arranging writers to go down to life). Now everyone should use their brains to summarize experience and improve methods. To improve our learning methods and working methods, we should deeply understand the spirit of Chairman Mao's speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" at the Supreme State Conference Enlarged Meeting. I believe that we should not only carefully study the part of the "speech" on "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," but also carefully study the entire "speech," so that it will be of great help in overcoming our mistakes of dogmatism, bureaucracy, and sectarianism.

### 贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”，反对教条主义和小资产阶级思想
茅盾

    贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”，反对教条主义和小资产阶级思想
    茅盾
    大约八个月前，党中央提出了“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针。八个月的时间，对于这样一种继往开来、规模远大、取精用宏、生气勃勃的学术、文艺活动说来，实在还是太短，不应该要求它已经会获得茂盛灿烂的果实。然而，尽管在这样短促的时间内，不但已经出现了万象竞新的局面，而且也已经有了值得称道的第一批收获。有害于学术研究和文艺创作的教条主义和宗派主义得到进一步的克服。
    自然，事情不会像有些人所想像那样轻而易举、通顺无阻。“放”和“鸣”还是未见大畅，而在反对教条主义的过程中，右倾思想也出现了。这就是不加分析地抹煞过去的成就，这就是懈怠乃至厌恶马列主义的学习，这就是强调了文艺的特殊性，并在文艺特殊性的借口下削弱文艺的思想性，乃至怀疑工农兵方向、怀疑马克思主义世界观对于创作的思想指导作用。
    在文学创作中，出现了“为恋爱而写恋爱”的、乃至色情气味相当浓重的作品，也出现了顾影自怜、欣赏“身边琐事”、几乎没有任何思想性的作品。
    也出现过这样的怪论：文艺作品的公式化、概念化之根源，在于工农兵方向云云。
    这些错误的思想，我们所不喜欢的“莠草”，以及有害的“毒草”，都是小资产阶级思想的反映。小资产阶级既是客观的存在，它的思想意识一定要顽强地表现出来。我们不应视而不见，亦不必惊惶失措。我们的文艺活动，基本上是健康的，向前发展着的。
    但是，右倾思想既已或多或少地见于文艺各部门，自然要引起普遍的注意乃至忧虑。抱着忧虑甚至惊惶心情的人们恐怕不少。陈其通等四位同志的“我们对目前文艺工作的几点意见”是有相当广泛的代表性的。我衷心地赞扬他们的保卫工农兵方向、保卫社会主义文化、向小资产阶级思想进行思想斗争的耿耿赤忱。可是他们的文章是缺乏说服力的，批评方法是教条主义的，其结果不但不能对小资产阶级思想作有效的斗争，而且给读者以“百花齐放、百家争鸣”原来是弊多利少的印象，给广大的、在“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针下鼓舞活跃的知识分子一瓢冷水。
    陈其通等四位同志没有把艺术事业中积极的社会主义因素和落后的小资产阶级因素两者力量的对比，作出正确的估计。他们看到去年6月以来的“百花”中放出了“莠草”或“毒草”，“百家”中鸣出了怪论、糊涂论，就不加分析地说，“文学艺术的战斗性减弱了，时代的面貌模糊了，时代的声音低沉了，社会主义建设的光辉在文学艺术这面镜子里光彩暗淡了，”这是不符合事实的。
    陈其通等四位同志的文章中提到了文艺工作中的一些重要问题，如题材方面的“家务事、儿女情”，如公式化概念化的问题，如戏剧传统剧目的挖掘与整理的问题，以及对于社会现实主义的讨论等等。但是令人遗憾，四位同志的文章把这些问题简单化了，没有全面分析这些问题的内容，而轻易地否定了和他们意见不合的议论：这是不能说服人的。这样的批评方法不能不说是教条主义的。他们认为今天有些同志对于社会主义现实主义所提出的意见是“怀疑论、取消论，是小资产阶级艺术思想的产物”，——这一论断，也是使人难以同意的。
    陈其通等四位同志反对小资产阶级艺术思想。我极端拥护他们这一个主张，而且我以为这应当是我们在文艺思想战线上的一个重要的课题。但我们进行这一思想斗争时，要小心提防回到教条主义的老调，要同时大力反对教条主义；简单地采取禁止“放”和“鸣”的方法，不能解决问题。小资产阶级思想的肃清，是长期的、复杂而细致的工作，我们的批评态度应当是从团结的愿望出发、通过批评和斗争，在新的基础上达到新的团结；我们的工作方法应当是让大家来“放”，来“鸣”，开展自由讨论，从讨论中加强马列主义的思想教育。我们应当鼓励和帮助文艺工作者深入生活、投入斗争，参加社会主义建设，把思想改造得更好。
    现在又有这样的议论：生活经验是一个作家最重要的本钱，而写真实，则是作品的“灵魂”。看来这话并不错。可是，这样的议论的背后却还有一个“理论”，即认为学习马列主义是无关重要的，认为作家的思想改造是不需要的。换言之，亦即认为马克思主义世界观不是作家所必要的。这样的所谓理论，是错误的。因为一个作家当其还没有马克思主义世界观的时候、脑子实在另有一种世界观（资产阶级思想乃至渗杂着封建思想的非无产阶级的世界观），而当他观照生活、艺术实践的时候，这原来有的世界观就在起“指导”作用。这不是很危险么？
    我以为马克思主义世界观是我们从事创作的人所必须获得的。我们希望人人都有这法宝。但是我们也要说清楚，这件事如果不在作家自愿的基础上，通过学习和生活实践，再加上集体的细致而耐心的帮助，就不能做好。如果我们今天就要求我们的作家都应当先具有马克思主义世界观而后写作，那就是不切实际，要求过高。并且一个作家如果（即使出于至诚）先来估量一下自己的世界观够不够马克思主义水平，然后下笔写作，那他将不是自信自欺，就会踌躇仿徨。马克思主义世界观不是一种学科，不是读完若干册书，能够说一套，就算毕了业的。一个作家怎样才能够算是具有了马克思主义世界观，要看他是不是能够对社会现实看得远，看得深，抓住关键问题，把握到社会发展的本质。而他的是否具有这个本领，也只有从他的作品来衡量。因此，作家的自己努力的方法，是不断地学习，不断地体验生活、参加斗争，不断地写作。帮助作家的方法，是对他的作品进行科学的批评。另一方面，一个批评家是不是掌握了马克思主义文艺理论，也只有从他的批评文章来衡量。批评家自己努力的方法，除了学习和写作，也应当有广泛的生活知识。帮助批评家的方法是对他的文章进行批评之批评。不要怕“放”出不好的东西来，而要及时进行与人为善的细致深刻的科学的批评、不要怕“鸣”出不入耳的声音，而要进行批评之批评，展开自由讨论。
    无论是对作品的批评，或者是对批评的批评，无益而有害的，永远是教条主义的批评。
    反对教条主义，同时要反对右倾思想：这是两条战线的斗争。这是长期的、细致的工作；不能以为一次运动就能够解决问题，而要随时随地，见一点就做一点。但是也应当有全面的长期的规划。个人意见，以为还是应当三方面并进，这就是加强学习马列主义，有计划地进行艺术实践，有计划地体验生活，——向人民学习，向社会学习。这三方面的工作，我们有过不少经验，有成就，也有缺点。最大的缺点，我以为是形式主义（有些而不是大部分的学习和体验生活）、教条主义（主要是学习方面），一般化（布置学习的方法和布置作家下去生活的方法）。现在应当大家来动脑筋，总结经验，改进方法。要改进我们的学习方法和工作方法，应当深深地体会毛主席在最高国务会议扩大会议的“正确地处理人民内部矛盾的问题”讲话的精神。我以为我们不但要认真学习“讲话”的关于“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的部分，也应当好好地认真地学习“讲话”的全部，这样，对于克服我们的教条主义、官僚主义和宗派主义的错误，才会有很大的帮助。
