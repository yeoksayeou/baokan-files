　　Rationally Arrange and Utilize Rural Women's Labor Force
    In the struggle to strive for a bumper harvest in 1957, attention must be paid to giving full play to the labor efficiency and potential strength of rural women. Agricultural cooperatives in various regions should regard the rational arrangement and use of women's labor as an important task, formulate specific plans for using women's labor, and enable women to play a greater role in agricultural and sideline production.
    The achievements of rural women participating in production in 1956 were tremendous. In areas where production is well-organized and where women have a relatively good habit of participating in agricultural production, women who regularly participate in agricultural production account for more than 90% of the total female labor force. In most areas, it reaches about 60% to 80%. In areas where women did not participate in production labor in the past, although it only reached 40% to 50%, there was a significant increase compared to before cooperation. Women have also made considerable contributions to rural sideline production. For example, in the Liyuan Advanced Agricultural Cooperative in Xinfan County, Sichuan Province, the output value of women engaged in sideline production accounts for about 73.8% of the total sideline output value of the entire cooperative.
    The reason why women have made great achievements in agricultural and sideline production is not only because the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of women has been greatly improved and the principle of "to each according to his work" has encouraged the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of women, but also because agricultural production cooperatives attach greater importance to the arrangement and use of women's labor than ever before. According to a survey of 772 agricultural cooperatives in six counties in Henan, about 60% of the agricultural cooperatives plan and use women's labor in a planned way.
    However, there are problems in the arrangement and use of women's labor. The relevant leadership did not adequately take into account the actual conditions of women's physiological characteristics, physical strength, and housework, and used women's labor too much and too heavily, neglecting safe production; and overemphasized agricultural collective labor, neglecting family sideline occupations and care for housework, which affected the actual income and family life of peasant families, and some casualties of women and children occurred in many places. There are also many agricultural production cooperatives that do not recognize the important role of tapping the potential of women's labor, and lack plans for using women's labor, resulting in the phenomenon of "men can't finish their work, women are rushing to do it, and old people have nothing to do but sit and watch," which can't appropriately meet women's requirements for participating in production, affecting the production of agricultural cooperatives and the increase of family income, and causing dissatisfaction among male and female members.
      The book "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside" points out: "Chinese women are a great human resource. This resource must be tapped and struggled for to build a great socialist country." In order to strive for a bumper harvest in 1957, we must accept the experiences and lessons of last year, arrange women's labor more rationally, and give fuller and more appropriate play to women's labor role. All agricultural production cooperatives should incorporate male and female labor into the plan in a unified manner, implement a rational division of labor between men and women, and formulate labor use plans in accordance with the spirit of being active and reliable.
    The rural female labor force roughly falls into the following categories: The first category is women who are strong, have no housework burden, or have a lighter housework burden, and they can participate in production labor for the vast majority of the time; the second category is those who have some housework burden, but who need to and may participate in certain production labor; and the third category is those who have an excessive housework burden or who have difficulty participating in collective labor within the commune due to physical conditions. Because each person's age, physical strength, work attitude, level of consciousness, and family needs are different, the actual attendance of women is also different. Some people, because there is little labor in the family and no other income, go to work too much regardless of physical strength and housework; some families are relatively wealthy, have a lot of labor, or have other income, and are unwilling to go to work more. In addition, the situation of each agricultural production cooperative is different, the original habits of women participating in production labor are different in various places, and each woman also has her own special situation. Agricultural cooperatives should, according to these different situations, implement labor project rankings, work order rankings, and labor rankings for agricultural and sideline labor, and make appropriate arrangements according to the characteristics of various types of female labor.
    Planning female labor should follow the mass line, adopt the method of combining leadership with the masses and persuasion and education, prevent and correct unrealistic situations such as women reporting too high or too low work points or not being able to adapt to the needs of increased production, and establish attendance requirements on an active and reliable basis. At the same time, it is also necessary to educate male and female members on safe production and maternal and child hygiene knowledge, and not allow women to engage in excessively heavy labor that harms their health, especially paying attention to labor protection during menstruation and pregnancy and appropriate rest during childbirth.
    Under the policy of taking agriculture as the mainstay and comprehensively developing diversified production, attention should be paid to organizing women to participate in agricultural and sideline production. On the one hand, it is necessary to continue to mobilize a large number of women and male members to jointly complete the task of agricultural production increase. On the other hand, attention should be paid to organizing women to participate in various sideline productions, especially some decentralized family sideline occupations and some family handicrafts. Some women with heavy housework burdens or who have difficulty participating in field production due to age and physical conditions are most suitable for engaging in family sideline production. And family sideline production is beneficial to the country, to agricultural production cooperatives, and to member families.
    On the premise of serving production, we must also appropriately take care of housework. Today's housework is to assist agricultural production and serve the socialist collective farmers. Taking care of the family life of members on the premise of subordinating to collective interests is a problem that should be paid attention to in correctly handling the relationship between the collective and the individual. When formulating labor use plans and allocating women's production, agricultural production cooperatives should leave women with the necessary time to freely dispose of. Some women rush to make clothes, shoes and socks for the whole family during slack farming seasons so that they can concentrate on participating in production during busy farming seasons; some peasant families implement a division of labor, with some people participating more in field labor and some people taking more responsibility for household affairs. These practices are all good. During busy farming seasons, there are certain contradictions between housework and production labor, especially in areas with more land and less labor and in cash crop areas, this contradiction is more prominent. On the premise of subordinating to production needs, it is necessary to find ways to reduce some housework that can be reduced. The method of organizing mass mutual assistance can be promoted. Some agricultural production cooperatives have established some service-oriented organizations on the basis of mass mutual assistance, such as the widespread establishment of childcare mutual assistance organizations, and a small number of areas have flour milling groups, sewing groups, and mutual cooking assistance, which have played a certain role in solving the difficulties of housework. In the future, we should still adhere to the principle of diligence and thrift, and solve practical problems, and take various simple, flexible, and convenient methods for the masses according to the needs of the members and the specific conditions of the agricultural cooperatives to solve this problem.
    In short, we should give full play to the labor enthusiasm of the masses of women, guide women to consciously abide by labor discipline, pay attention to production safety, and strive to do a good job in production, household affairs, and physical health. We should always pay attention to strengthening political and ideological education among the masses of women and improve the communist consciousness of the masses of women. We should further implement the principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women, and correct the various unreasonable phenomena of suppressing women's work points in various forms that still exist in many agricultural cooperatives, in order to improve women's enthusiasm for production. We should universally cultivate female backbones in agricultural cooperatives, help them to have closer ties with the members, improve their work ability, and strive to do a good job in production.

### 合理地安排和使用农村妇女劳动力

　　合理地安排和使用农村妇女劳动力
    在争取1957年大丰收的斗争中，必须注意发挥农村妇女的劳动效能和潜在力量。各地农业社应该把合理地安排和使用妇女劳力当作一项重要工作，制定使用妇女劳力的具体计划，使妇女在农副业生产上发挥更大的作用。
    1956年农村妇女参加生产的成绩是巨大的。在生产组织得好而且过去妇女参加农业生产的习惯比较好的地区，经常参加农业生产的妇女达到女劳力总数的90％以上。多数地区达到60％至80％左右。在过去妇女没有参加生产劳动习惯的地区，虽只达到40％到50％，但比合作化以前也有了显著增加。妇女在农村副业生产方面也有不少贡献。如四川省新繁县李园高级农业社，妇女从事副业生产的产值约占全社副业总产值的73.8％。
    妇女在农副业生产上所以取得巨大成绩，除了妇女群众的社会主义觉悟大大提高，按劳取酬的原则鼓舞了妇女群众的生产热情以外，就是因为农业生产合作社对妇女劳动力的安排和使用，比以往任何时期更加重视。据河南六个县七百七十二个农业社的调查，有计划地安排和使用妇女劳力的社约占农业社总数的60％左右。
    但是，在安排和使用妇女劳力方面并不是没有问题的。有关领导方面对妇女的生理特点、体力条件和家务劳动等实际情况照顾不够，曾经过多过重地使用妇女劳动力，忽视了安全生产；并且过于偏重农业集体劳动，忽视家庭副业和对家务的照顾，以致影响了农民家庭的实际收入和家庭生活，许多地方还发生了一些妇女儿童伤亡事故。也还有不少农业生产合作社，对发挥妇女劳动潜力的重要作用认识不够，使用妇女劳力缺乏计划，以致发生“男人活计干不完，女人活计抢着干，老人没活坐着看”的现象，不能适当地满足妇女参加生产的要求，影响到农业社的生产和家庭收入的增加，引起男女社员的不满。
      “中国农村的社会主义高潮”一书指出：“中国的妇女是一种伟大的人力资源。必须发掘这种资源，为了建设一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗。”为了争取1957年的大丰收，必须接受去年的经验教训，更加合理地安排妇女劳力，更充分而又适当地发挥妇女的劳动作用。各农业生产合作社应该把男女劳动力统一纳入规划，实行男女合理分工分业，根据积极而又可靠的精神，制定劳力使用计划。
    农村妇女劳动力大体有以下几种情况：第一种是身强力壮、没有家务负担或家务负担较轻的妇女，她们能够以绝大部分时间参加生产劳动；第二种是有一些家务负担，但本人需要也可能参加一定的生产劳动的；第三种是家务负担过重或因身体条件参加社内集体劳动有困难的。由于每个人的年龄、体力、劳动态度、觉悟程度、家庭需要不同，妇女实际出勤的情况也不相同，有的因为家中劳动力少又无其他收入，就不顾体力和家务而过多的出勤；有的家中比较富裕，劳动力多或另有收入，就不愿多出勤。此外，各农业生产合作社的情况不同，各地妇女原来参加生产劳动的习惯不同，每个妇女也都有其特殊情况等。农业社应该根据这些不同情况，实行农副业劳动项目排队，工序排队，劳力排队，按照妇女劳动力的各种不同类型的特点，分别作适当的安排。
    规划妇女劳动力，要走群众路线，采取领导同群众相结合和说服教育的方法，防止和纠正妇女群众报工偏高偏低等不切实际或不能适应增产需要的情况，使出勤要求建立在积极而又可靠的基础上。同时，还要对男女社员进行安全生产和妇婴卫生常识教育，不要让妇女从事伤害健康的过重劳动，尤其要注意经期、孕期的劳动保护和产期的适当休息。
    在以农业为主、全面发展多种生产的方针下，要注意组织妇女参加农副业生产。一方面要继续发动大量妇女和男社员共同完成农业增产的任务。另一方面，要注意组织妇女参加多种副业生产，特别是一些分散的家庭副业和一些家庭手工业等。一部分家务负担重，或因年龄体力条件参加田间生产有困难的妇女，最适宜于从事家庭副业生产。而家庭副业生产也是对国家、对农业生产合作社、对社员家庭都有好处的。
    在为生产服务的前提下，还要适当照顾家务劳动。今天的家务劳动是辅助农业生产和为社会主义集体农民服务的。在服从集体利益的前提下，照顾社员的家庭生活，是正确处理集体同个人关系应注意的问题。农业生产合作社在制定劳动力使用计划、分配妇女生产的时候，要留给妇女必要的可以自由支配的时间。有些妇女在农闲时把一家的衣服鞋袜赶作好，以便农忙时集中力量参加生产；有些农民家庭实行分工，有的人多参加田间劳动，有的人多负责料理家务，这些作法都是好的。在农忙季节，家务劳动和生产劳动有一定的矛盾，特别在地多劳力少的地区和经济作物区，这种矛盾比较突出。在服从生产需要的前提下，须要设法减轻一些可能减轻的家务劳动。组织群众互助的办法是可以推广的。有些农业生产合作社建立了一些在群众互助的基础上的服务性的组织，如普遍建立了托儿互助组织，少数地区有磨面组、缝纫组和做饭互助等，对解决家务劳动的困难起了一定的作用。今后仍应本着勤俭节约，又能解决实际问题的原则，根据社员需要和农业社的具体条件，采取简便灵活便利群众的多种办法，来解决这方面的问题。
    总之，应该充分发挥妇女群众的劳动积极性，引导妇女自觉地遵守劳动纪律，注意生产安全，努力做到生产好，家务好，身体好，应该经常注意在妇女群众中加强政治思想教育，提高妇女群众的共产主义觉悟。应该进一步贯彻实行男女同工同酬的原则，纠正目前还在不少农业社存在的各种不同形式的压低妇女工分的不合理现象，以提高妇女生产的积极性。应该普遍培养农业社妇女骨干，帮助她们更加密切同社员的联系，提高工作能力，努力搞好生产。
