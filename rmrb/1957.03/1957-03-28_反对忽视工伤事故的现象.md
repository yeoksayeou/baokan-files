　　Oppose the Phenomenon of Neglecting Work-Related Accidents
　　Shen Shi
　　The Karamay Mining Bureau is vigorously carrying out work to prevent accidents.

　　Since January of this year, the Karamay Mining Bureau has been experiencing continuous engineering and casualty accidents in drilling, derrick installation, and transportation. Some serious accidents were caused by failure to comply with safe operating procedures or dereliction of duty. On February 17th, when lowering the drill string in well number 250, the driller did not comply with operating procedures and raised the traveling block at a fast speed before it was stable, resulting in the right arm of a derrick worker being broken into three pieces. The driller of well number 122 casually handed over the brake handle on the drilling rig to a worker from another drilling team. This worker did not understand drilling methods, resulting in the drill pipe being broken. Well number 86 broke its drill pipe three times in February, all due to the carelessness of the staff. During the installation of derricks at the Wuerhe Engineering Section, there was even a tragic incident of a tractor running over and injuring a worker.

　　Frequent accidents have caused serious losses. According to statistics from the Mining Bureau, the ninety-five engineering accidents that occurred from January of last year to February of this year resulted in a loss of more than 18,200 work hours, equivalent to more than two years of work for a drilling rig. The reason for the continuous occurrence of accidents is mainly due to insufficient safety production education for employees. Karamay is a newly discovered oil field, and exploration work is developing rapidly, with new workers accounting for a large proportion of the total number of employees. Among them, some are demobilized and transferred soldiers, and some come from rural or pastoral areas. They have never seen drilling before and do not understand safety production knowledge. In theory, after they start working, they must first learn safety production regulations. However, the Mining Bureau has neglected this aspect, so more than half of the work-related accidents are caused by workers not understanding safety technology knowledge. Secondly, some leaders and engineering technicians of the Mining Bureau do not pay attention to preventing accidents from happening in peacetime, and are forced to deal with them only after serious accidents occur; and when dealing with them, they rarely pay attention to educating all employees through specific accidents. At the Karamay Mining Bureau, it is not that there are no drilling teams or workshops that do a good job in safety production, but the leadership has not summarized their experience in a timely manner. Many employees are still negligent and have not realized that production accidents are the biggest enemy of oil field development. Some drilling teams do not write accident reports after accidents occur, and some even conceal accidents.

　　At a recent meeting convened by the Karamay Engineering Section with the participation of section chiefs, engineers, and drilling technicians, some drilling technicians pointed out that in order to complete the monthly drilling footage plan, the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration, the Karamay Mining Bureau, and the Engineering Section often focus on catching up with footage during drilling, sometimes emphasizing newly started exploration wells and neglecting exploration wells that have not yet been completed and are drilling slowly or have had accidents. People from the Engineering Section and the Drilling Department also frequently visit the wells, believing that newly started wells have potential, while those that have not yet been completed, are drilling slowly, or have more accidents do not. This understanding of production potential is only covering up shortcomings in production, attempting to make up for footage from newly started wells.

　　The Karamay oil field is located in a remote border area. Thanks to the support of the people of all ethnic groups in the country and Xinjiang, production and living conditions have improved to some extent, but they are still difficult. In the past year, all employees of the Mining Bureau have achieved certain results in developing this new oil field, but in a difficult environment, it is even more necessary for the persons in charge of the Mining Bureau and the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration to conduct in-depth work and discover problems in production and work in a timely manner. However, according to workers' reflections, a small number of persons in charge are still floating on the surface and rarely inquire about their hardships. Therefore, they cannot discover problems in production in a timely manner and solve them.

　　In the campaign to increase production and practice economy, the Karamay Mining Bureau and the CPC Karamay Mining Bureau Committee believe that to increase production and practice economy, it is necessary to first grasp the important links and reduce and eliminate accidents in production. Currently, the Mining Bureau is launching work to prevent accidents. We hope that the leaders of this bureau will conduct in-depth work, give employees a safety production lesson, and make the education on eliminating accidents and preventing accidents deeply rooted in everyone's heart.

　　反对忽视工伤事故的现象
　　沈石
    克拉玛依矿务局正在大张旗鼓地开展防止事故的工作。
    今年1月以来，克拉玛依矿务局在钻井、安装井架和运输当中，不断发生工程和伤亡事故。某些恶性事故，有的是由于不遵守安全操作规程或玩忽职责所造成的，今年2月17日，二百五十号井下钻杆时，钻井员不遵守操作规程，没有等到游动滑车稳定，马上用快速度将游动滑车向上提升，结果将一名井架工的右臂折成三段。一百二十二号井钻井员随便将钻机上的闸把交给别的井队的工人来操作，这个工人不懂得钻井方法，结果将钻杆折断。八十六号井在2月份折断钻杆三次，都是因为工作人员粗心大意所造成。在乌尔禾工程段安装井架时，甚至发生拖拉机辗伤工人的惨事。
    频繁的事故，造成了严重的损失。据矿务局统计，从去年1月到今年2月发生的九十五次工程事故中，损失一万八千二百多个工作小时，相当于一台钻机工作两年多的时间。事故不断发生的原因，主要是对职工的安全生产教育做得不够。克拉玛依是新发现的油田，勘探工作发展很快，新工人占职工总数很大的比重。他们当中，有的是复员转业军人，有的来自农村或牧业区。他们过去从来没有见过钻井，不懂得安全生产知识。按照道理，他们参加工作以后，必须首先学习安全生产规程。但是矿务局恰恰忽略了这一方面，因此在工伤事故中，有一半以上是由于工人不懂得安全技术知识造成的。其次，矿务局的某些领导人员和工程技术人员，平时不注意防止事故的发生，等到有了严重的事故，才被迫去处理；而在处理的时候，又很少注意通过具体事故来教育全体职工。在克拉玛依矿务局，并不是没有对安全生产做得好的井队或车间，但是领导方面也没有及时地总结他们的经验。许多职工仍然麻痹大意，没有认识到生产上的事故是开发油田最大的敌人。有的井队在事故发生以后，不写事故报告，甚至有的井队还隐瞒事故。
    在克拉玛依工程段最近召集的有段长、工程师和钻井技师参加的一次会议上，有的钻井技师指出：新疆石油管理局、克拉玛依矿务局和工程段，为了完成每月钻井进尺计划，在钻井当中，往往热衷于赶进尺，在赶进尺的工作中，有时偏重于新开钻的探井，忽视尚未完钻以及钻进缓慢或者已经发生事故的探井。工程段和钻井处的人也经常来往井上，他们认为新开的井有潜力，而那些尚未完钻、钻进缓慢或事故较多的井却没有潜力，这种对于生产潜力的了解，只不过是掩盖生产当中的缺点，企图从新开钻的井来弥补进尺罢了。
    克拉玛依油田僻处边陲，由于全国和新疆各族人民的支援，在生产和生活条件方面，虽然有所改善，毕竟还是艰苦的。过去一年，矿务局全体职工开发这一新的油田取得了一定的成绩，但是在艰苦的环境中，更需要矿务局和新疆石油管理局的负责人深入进行工作，及时发现生产和工作中的问题。但据工人们反映，有少数的负责人还是漂浮在上面，很少过问他们的疾苦，因此，不能及时发现生产中的问题，加以解决。
    在增产节约运动中，克拉玛依矿务局和中共克拉玛依矿务局委员会认为要增产节约，必须首先抓住重要的环节，减少和消灭生产中的事故。目前，矿务局正在展开防止事故的工作。我们希望这个局的领导人员深入地进行工作，给职工群众补上一次安全生产的课，使消灭事故、防止事故的教育深入到每一个人的心中。
