Nine months ago, U Nu resigned from the post of Prime Minister in order to carry out the reorganization of the ruling Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League. It is reported that U Nu's reappointment as Prime Minister will not affect his leadership in the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League.

Prime Minister U Nu will deliver his first policy statement to the parliament on March 4th.

    缅甸新内阁宣誓就职
    新华社仰光2日电  缅甸总理吴努和内阁全体阁员3月1日上午在总统府在总统巴宇和最高法院首席法官吴登貌面前宣誓就职。
    新内阁包括副总理吴巴瑞（负责国防）、藻昆卓（负责外交）、吴觉迎（负责国民经济）、德钦丁 （负责社会事务）和其他二十五名阁员。
    除了已经被提名为缅甸总统的前交通部长吴温貌以外，吴巴瑞内阁的全体成员都留在新政府中。新任命的两位部长是反法西斯人民自由同盟总书记德钦觉顿（担任农林部长）和克钦族领袖杜瓦信瓦瑙 （担任民族团结部长）。
    九个月以前，吴努为了进行执政党反法西斯人民自由同盟的改组工作而辞去了总理的职务。消息说，吴努再次被任命为内阁总理并不会影响他在反法西斯人民自由同盟中的领导。
    吴努总理将在3月4日向国会发表第一次政策声明。
