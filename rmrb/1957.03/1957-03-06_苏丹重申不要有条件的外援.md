    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 5th: Sudanese Prime Minister Khalil said on the 4th that the Sudanese government, in past official statements, had clearly announced that it refuses to participate in any military treaties and refuses to accept foreign aid with conditions attached, whether from Eastern or Western countries.
    Khalil said that this is the unwavering policy that the government has adhered to in the past and continues to adhere to now.
    According to a report from the Middle East News Agency from Khartoum, Khalil made these remarks when commenting on recent rumors that the Sudanese government is leaning towards the Western camp and accepting "financial aid" from the US Point Four Program.

    苏丹重申不要有条件的外援
    新华社开罗5日电　苏丹总理哈利勒4日说，苏丹政府在过去的正式声明中曾经明确地宣布，它拒绝参加所有的军事条约，并且拒绝接受不论是东方国家还是西方国家所提供的带有条件的外国援助。
    哈利勒说，这是政府过去和现在所奉行的确定不移的政策。
    据中东通讯社自喀土穆报道，哈利勒是在评论最近流传的关于苏丹政府倾向西方阵营、并且接受美国第四点计划的“财政援助”的谣言时说这番话的。
