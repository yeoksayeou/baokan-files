　　Survey of Lancang River Hydropower Resources

　　Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 25th. China has begun surveying the hydropower resources of the Lancang River. In mid-March, a group of surveyors dispatched by the Kunming Hydropower Design Institute arrived in the middle and lower reaches of the Lancang River and began surveying. Four survey teams will also begin work soon.

　　The Lancang River originates in Qinghai, flows into Yunnan through the Changdu area, and flows out of the country from southern Yunnan. It is about 1,600 kilometers long within Yunnan Province, winding between the Yunling and Nushan mountains from north to south. The current is rapid and the drop is very large. Because the upper reaches pass through many snow-capped mountains, the water volume is very abundant even in the dry season. The middle and lower reaches of the Lancang River have relatively straight riverbeds, and navigation can be possible with slight dredging.

　  普查澜沧江水力资源
    据新华社昆明25日电　我国开始普查澜沧江的水力资源。3月中旬，由昆明水力发电设计院派出的一批测量人员已经到达澜沧江的中段和下段，开始测量。四个普查组也将在最近开始工作。
    澜沧江发源于青海，经昌都地区流入云南，由云南南部流出国境。在云南省境内长约一千六百公里，河身自北而南蜿蜒于云岭和怒山之间，流势湍急，落差很大。因为上游经过重重雪山，即使在枯水季节水量也很充沛。澜沧江的中段和下段，河床较直，稍为疏浚就可以通航。
