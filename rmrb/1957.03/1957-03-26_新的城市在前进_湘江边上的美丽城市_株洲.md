    A train on the Yuehan Line slowly pulled into Zhuzhou Station. In the carriage I was in, eight or nine out of ten passengers were getting off here. Those who were continuing their journey also looked out through the windows on both sides with interest. Amidst the loud whistle, the noise of talking, and the commotion of moving luggage, one could hear the passengers' joyful and surprised exclamations:
    "Hey, look, that must be a big factory!" A middle-aged man pushed his friend and said.
    "Well, look! The scale of this factory is much grander than the one you pointed out!" Although I was about to get off in a few minutes, looking out from the train window, the huge chimneys and water towers, like countless pillars supporting the sky, proudly soared into the clouds. The newly built houses, seemingly like stars in the sky, were scattered across a large expanse of land, stretching as far as the eye could see. The rooftops, the buildings under construction, the tall scaffolding, and the distant hills were covered with a thin layer of spring snow, shimmering silver in the sunlight. What a charming scene!
    In the past few years, this emerging city has built seventeen main roads, crisscrossing and interweaving, with a total length of twenty kilometers. There are two thousand newly built two- and three-story buildings. These include workers' dormitories, department stores, banks, post offices, cinemas, workers' cultural palaces, and more. Under construction are: an automated coal preparation plant with an annual output of 1.8 million tons, a fully mechanized ramie textile factory, as well as smelters, chemical plants, electric pole preservation plants, rubber factories, glass factories, oil factories, a large-scale automated rice processing plant, a thermal power plant, a water plant, and more than ten other large factories. Some of these factories have already started production, while others are under construction.
    In the early days of liberation, this ancient Zhuzhou, with a history of over 1,700 years, was just a small town under the jurisdiction of Xiangtan County, with a population of only 7,000. Now it is an industrial city with a population of over 100,000. It not only has the convenience of the Xiang River's thousand-mile waterway, but also connects the Yuehan and Zhegan railway arteries; the Xiangqian Railway, which is about to be built, will start in Zhuzhou.
    We passed through rows of neat new buildings, crossing many roads under construction. Trucks transporting materials were lined up on the road in a "long dragon"; the heavy roar of excavators, road rollers, bulldozers, and cars, the sound of cranes, booms, and hoists, plus all kinds of miscellaneous noises, formed a magnificent symphony. One can imagine how beautiful it would be when the roads are paved with asphalt and planted with plane trees and citrus trees, and people ride in new-type buses and bicycles on tree-lined avenues!
    The section of the Xiang River flowing through the urban area meanders and twists, revealing the endless beauty of nature! People will plant peach, willow, osmanthus, maple, and poplar trees along the river. On Sundays, people can go to the riverside park, participate in musical dances, or chat and drink tea under the trees, or sit in a recliner under the osmanthus trees, admiring the white sails on the green Xiang River.
    This beautiful new industrial city is just one of the new cities that have emerged during our country's first Five-Year Plan! (Attached picture)

　　新的城市在前进
　　湘江边上的美丽城市——株洲
　　柯善文
    粤汉线上一列火车缓缓地开进了株洲车站。我乘坐的这列车厢里，十之八九的旅客都要在这里下车。还要继续行程的人，也不安静地从两边的玻璃窗往外看。在高亢的气笛声、说话声和搬动行李的繁杂的声浪中，听得出旅客们的充满了欢乐、惊奇的赞美声：
    “喂，你看，那准是个大工厂！”一个中年人推着他的朋友说。
    “嗯，你看！这个厂的规模，比你指的那个要宏伟得多！”。我虽然几分钟就要下车，从车窗往外看去，那巨大的烟囱和水塔，像无数根顶天柱一般，高傲地直耸云霄。新盖的房屋，仿佛像天上的星星一般，布满在大片土地上，一眼望不到边。楼顶上，和那正在施工中的建筑物、高大的脚手架上，以及远处的小山上，还复盖着一层薄薄的春雪，经太阳照射，银光闪闪。多么迷人的景色！
    几年来，这座新兴的城市，仅纵横交错的道路干线就修了十七条，全长二十公里。新建的两层到三层的楼房有两千栋。其中包括工人宿舍、百货公司、银行、邮局、电影院、工人文化宫等等。正在加紧施工的有：年产一百八十万吨的自动化生产的选煤厂、全部机械化的苎麻纺织厂，还有冶炼厂、化工厂、电杆防腐厂、橡胶厂、玻璃厂、油脂厂、大型自动化的大米加工厂、火力发电厂、自来水厂等十多个大工厂。这些工厂有的已经投入生产，有的在加紧施工中。
    解放初期，这个已经有一千七百多年历史的古老的株洲还是隶属于湘潭县的一个小镇，当时仅有七千人口。现在它已经是一个拥有十多万人口的工业城市了。它不仅有千里湘江航运之便，还连贯着粤汉、浙赣两条铁路动脉；将要兴建的湘黔铁路，株洲就是它的起点。
    我们穿过一排排整齐的新建筑物，横跨过许多条正在修筑的马路。运材料的汽车，在马路上摆成一条“长龙”；开山机、压路机、推土机、和汽车的沉重的马达轰隆声，吊车、吊杆、起重机的响声，加上各种各样的噪杂声，组成了一支雄壮的交响乐。可以想像，再过些时候，当马路铺上柏油，栽上梧桐和柑橘树的时候，人们乘坐着新型的公共汽车、自行车在林荫大道行驶的情形，是何等美丽的一幅图画啊！
    流临市区的这一段湘江，回湾曲折，显出大自然的无穷的秀美！人们将要沿江种上桃、柳、桂、枫和白杨。星期天，人们可以到江边公园，参加音乐舞会，或在树荫底下品茶谈心，也可坐在桂树下的躺椅上，欣赏那碧绿的湘江之上的片片白帆。
    这秀丽的崭新的工业城，不过是我们祖国第一个五年计划期间出现的新城市之一！（附图片）
