People in old revolutionary base areas such as Longyan, Fujian
Donate a batch of precious revolutionary cultural relics

    (Our newspaper's dispatch) The people of the old revolutionary base area of Longyan, Fujian Province, have donated a batch of precious revolutionary cultural relics. Among these cultural relics are a letter from the Presidium of the Executive Committee of the Communist International to the Chinese Communist Party, autobiographies of sixty-four members of the Party Central Committee during the Soviet period, the "Party Central Committee's Resolution on the Work of Red May in 1929," written materials of Chairman Mao at the Camellia Party in Meikeng Village, Ruijin, the "Outline of the Poor Peasants' Association Organization and Work," the resolutions of the First Congress of Workers and Peasants' Representatives in Western Fujian, the Organizational Law and Marriage Law of the Chinese Soviet, the "Party's Ten Major Programs," and the "Teaching Outline of the Soviet Regime," etc.
    According to incomplete statistics from nine counties including Longyan, Shanghang, and Ninghua, from December last year to the end of January this year, the masses have contributed a total of 849 pieces of valuable revolutionary historical materials. These precious revolutionary cultural relics are of great value for compiling revolutionary history.
    In the dark years before liberation, the people of the old revolutionary area of Western Fujian, full of confidence in the victory of the revolution, regardless of the Kuomintang reactionaries' wanton destruction and brutal searches, used various methods to preserve these revolutionary cultural relics in ancestral halls, old houses, old residences, secret rooms, underground caves, and walls. Comrade Qiu Ruiqi, an old revolutionary comrade from Ninghua County, contributed a box of revolutionary cultural relics that had been preserved for more than 20 years in this donation of revolutionary historical archives and cultural relics. Cao Yucheng from Tongxian Township, Caixi District, Shanghang County, pasted the "Red China Daily" on the wall during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, with a layer of grass paper pasted on top to cover it, and now he has also donated it.

    福建龙岩等革命老根据地群众
    捐献一批珍贵革命文物
    本报讯  福建省龙岩革命老根据地群众捐献了一批珍贵的革命文物。这批文物中有共产国际执委主席团给中国共产党的信，苏维埃时期党中央六十四个委员的自传，“1929年党中央关于红五月的工作决议”，毛主席在瑞金梅坑村茶花会上的文书材料，“贫农团组织与工作大纲”，闽西第一次工农代表大会的决议，中华苏维埃组织法、婚姻法，“党的十大政纲”，“苏维埃政权讲授大纲”等。
    据龙岩、上杭、宁化等九个县的不完全统计，从去年12月到今年1月底为止，群众共献出有价值的革命历史资料八百四十九件。这些珍贵的革命文物，对编写革命历史有很高的价值。
    在解放前黑暗的年代里，闽西老区人民满怀革命胜利的信心，不顾反动派大肆摧残和凶暴的搜查，用各种办法把这些革命文物保藏在祠堂、旧舍、老屋、暗房、地洞、墙壁中。宁化县老革命同志丘瑞齐，在这次捐献革命历史档案文物中，献出了保藏二十多年的一箱革命文物；上杭县才溪区通贤乡曹玉成在第二次国内革命战争时期，将“红色中华报”贴在壁上，上面加贴一层草纸遮住，现在也把它献了出来。 （本报福建记者站）
