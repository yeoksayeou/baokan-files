Xinhua News Agency, March 6th: Peng Zhen, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committe and First Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, delivered a report today at a meeting held by the Beijing Municipal Women's Federation, calling on every woman to strive to become an activist in socialism. More than seven thousand female cadres from central and Beijing municipal机关 attended the report meeting.

    In his report, Peng Zhen first discussed the current international situation and domestic conditions.

    Then, Peng Zhen said: Women should continue to transform their thinking and improve themselves in socialist construction and socialist transformation, so that they can become active participants in transforming and building socialism.

    He said: For women to become socialist activists, they must serve the country and the people wholeheartedly, improve their abilities, increase their knowledge, and work hard. He said: We should compete in politics, work, and knowledge, not in enjoyment, ostentation, or extravagance.

    He said: Women should participate in work in a realistic manner, according to the situation, and to the best of their ability. If they have several children at home, they should take good care of and educate their children. If they can do other work, they should do it well. What is progress? A person who does things that are beneficial to the country and the people is making progress.

    Peng Zhen said: Some people are now unwilling to do women's work, thinking that women's work is trivial. This is wrong. Can we say that doing the work of more than 300 million people is trivial? He hopes that women will take active action. Those who do women's work must first focus on solving the ideological problems of women, be good at grasping typical examples, systematically study them, and solve the urgent problems of women. At the same time, attention should be paid to mobilizing the broad masses of women to solve their own problems. The Party and the state will naturally support women and help them solve the difficulties in their work.

    彭真向中央和北京市机关女干部作报告
    号召妇女争取做社会主义积极分子
    据新华社6日讯　中共中央政治局委员、北京市委第一书记彭真，今天在北京市民主妇女联合会举办的一个报告会上，号召每一个妇女要争取做社会主义的积极分子。参加这个报告会的有七千多个中央机关和北京市机关的女干部。
    彭真在报告中首先讲了目前的国际形势和国内情况。
    接着彭真说：妇女应该在社会主义建设、社会主义改造中，继续改造自己的思想和提高自己，使自己成为改造和建设社会主义的积极分子。
    他说：妇女要成为社会主义积极分子，就要全心全意为国家、为人民服务，好好提高自己的能力，增加知识，努力工作。他说：我们要比政治、比工作、比知识，不要比享受、比排场、比阔气。
    他说：妇女参加工作要实事求是，按照情况，各尽所能。家里有几个孩子，就应该把孩子带好、教好。能做别的工作的，应该把别的工作做好。什么是进步呢？一个人做对国家对人民有益的事情，就是进步。
    彭真说：现在有些人不愿做妇女工作，认为妇女工作是琐碎事情，这是错误的，能说做三万万多人的工作是琐碎的事情吗？他希望妇女们积极行动起来。做妇女工作的人，首先要抓紧解决妇女中的思想问题，要善于抓住典型，系统地加以研究，解决妇女们的迫切问题。同时要注意发动广大妇女自己解决自己的问题。党和国家自然要支持妇女，帮助她们解决工作中的困难。
