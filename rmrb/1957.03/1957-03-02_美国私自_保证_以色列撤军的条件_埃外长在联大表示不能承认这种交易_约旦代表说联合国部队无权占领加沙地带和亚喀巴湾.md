Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 1st: The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary meeting on the afternoon of February 28th to continue discussing the issue of Israeli withdrawal.

    Egyptian Foreign Minister Fawzi stated that Israel is currently playing tricks on the withdrawal issue. Fawzi pointed out that some private talks are currently taking place outside the United Nations, and these talks are rarely consulted with Egypt, nor with the United Nations General Assembly. In these talks, some people are making guarantees that they have no right to make in exchange for Israeli withdrawal. Egypt believes that Israel's withdrawal must not be the result of a deal made anywhere. Egypt and the United Nations cannot recognize such a deal.

    Bulgarian representative Voutov demanded sanctions against Israel.

    Jordanian representative Rifai said that UN forces have no right to occupy the Gaza Strip and the Gulf of Aqaba, as this is not within the scope of the UN forces' duties.

    Indonesian representative Hanifa said that the first step taken by the General Assembly must be to eradicate Israeli aggression in order to pave the way for a more lasting solution to the entire Palestinian issue.

    Iraqi representative Jamali demanded that Israeli troops withdraw from Egypt immediately. Jamali said he wanted to appeal to the United States: Now is not the time to engage in "opposition to the Arabs, opposition to principles, opposition to justice," but rather to adopt an attitude of "fairness and impartiality."

    Ukrainian representative Kizya said that the General Assembly should have condemned Israel long ago and taken strong measures against it, including sanctions. He accused the United States, Britain, and France of supporting Israel.

Xinhua News Agency, March 1st: United Press International Washington reported that US and Israeli officials were holding meetings on February 28 to finalize an agreement providing "guarantees" for Israeli withdrawal.

    US news agencies reported that the content of this agreement includes: after Israeli troops withdraw from the Gaza Strip, UN forces will immediately enter Gaza and establish a UN force military government there; UN forces will occupy the Sharm el-Sheikh area after Israel withdraws, while the United States and other countries will guarantee "free navigation" in the Gulf of Aqaba. The period for which UN forces will occupy the Gaza and Aqaba Gulf regions will last until the Egyptian-Israeli dispute is resolved.

    The report said that Mollet and Ben-Gurion actively participated in the negotiations of this agreement during their stay in Washington.

    美国私自“保证”以色列撤军的条件
    埃外长在联大表示不能承认这种交易
    约旦代表说联合国部队无权占领加沙地带和亚喀巴湾
    据新华社1日讯  纽约消息：联合国大会2月28日下午举行全体会议，继续讨论以色列撤军问题。
    埃及外交部长法齐发言，他指出，以色列目前正在撤军问题上玩弄把戏。法齐指出，目前在联合国外正在进行一些私下的会谈，这些会谈都是很少同埃及商量，也没有同联合国大会商量。在这些会谈中，有人正在为了换取以色列撤军而作出他们根本无权作出的保证。埃及认为，以色列的撤退决不能是在任何地方进行的一种交易的结果。埃及和联合国不能承认这种交易。
    保加利亚代表伏托夫要求对以色列进行制裁。
    约旦代表里法伊说，联合国部队无权占领加沙地带和亚喀巴湾，因为这不在联合国部队的职权范围内。
    印度尼西亚代表哈尼法说，大会采取的第一个步骤必须是根除以色列的侵略，以便为整个巴勒斯坦问题的较为持久的解决铺平道路。
    伊拉克代表贾马利要求以色列军队马上撤出埃及。贾马利说，他要向美国发出呼吁：现在不是进行“反对阿拉伯，反对公理、反对正义”的时候，而是采取“公平无私”的态度的时候。
    乌克兰代表基齐亚说，大会早就应当谴责以色列，并且对它采取包括制裁在内的有力措施。他指责美、英、法三国支持以色列。
    据新华社1日讯  合众社华盛顿消息说，美国和以色列官员2月28日正在举行会议，就给予以色列撤军提供“保证”的协议进行最后润色。
    美国通讯社传说，这个协议的内容有：在以色列军队撤出加沙地带以后，联合国部队立即进驻加沙，并且在那里成立联合国部队的军政府；联合国部队在以色列撤军后占领沙姆沙伊赫地区，同时由美国和其他一些国家保证亚喀巴湾的“自由通航”。联合国部队占领加沙和亚喀巴湾地区的期限，将一直到埃及—以色列争端解决时为止。
    消息说，摩勒和比诺在华盛顿期间，曾经积极参与了这个协议的谈判。
