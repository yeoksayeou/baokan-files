Shanxi Provincial Leading Cadres Go Deep into Grassroots to Inspect Spring Plowing

    (Our report) The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Shanxi Provincial People's Committee recently extracted one hundred and fifty cadres (including some democratic personages) from provincial-level organs to form a spring plowing inspection team. They will spend one month going deep into the grassroots to inspect and assist spring plowing production work. The inspection team is divided into five groups: The first group is led by Tao Lujia, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, to Yanbei Prefecture; Acting Governor Wei Heng leads one group to Xinxian Prefecture; Deputy Governor Liu Kaiji leads one group to Yuci Prefecture; Provincial Party Secretary Wang Qian leads one group to Changzhi Prefecture; and Provincial Party Propaganda Minister Huang Zhigang leads one group to Jinan Prefecture. On the afternoon of the 6th, Wang Qian, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, made a mobilization report to all members of the inspection team. The inspection teams will depart separately on the 10th.
