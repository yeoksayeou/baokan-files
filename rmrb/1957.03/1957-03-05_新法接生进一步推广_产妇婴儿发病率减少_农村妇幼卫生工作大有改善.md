 The agricultural cooperation has created more favorable conditions for improving rural women's and children's health and welfare. At present, various places have particularly improved the backward delivery methods that have the greatest impact on the health of women and children, greatly improving the historically backward situation of neglecting maternal hygiene.

 Since last year, all parts of the country have trained a large number of new-method midwives for cooperatives. According to preliminary statistics from seventeen provinces including Jiangxi, Henan, Jiangsu, Shandong, Guangdong, Gansu, and Shaanxi in November last year, there were more than 475,000 midwives, more than 163,000 more than the national number of midwives in 1955. In addition, according to preliminary statistics from ten provinces and autonomous regions including Xinjiang, Guizhou, Guangxi, Anhui, and Inner Mongolia, more than 138,000 new midwives have been trained since agricultural cooperation. Now, the number of blank townships without new-method midwives has been greatly reduced. In Changzhi Prefecture, Shanxi Province, one-third of the townships had no new-method midwives in 1955, but there were no blank townships in 1956.

 Due to the widespread promotion of new-method delivery, the incidence of newborn tetanus and maternal puerperal fever has been greatly reduced. According to statistics from ten counties in Cangxian Prefecture, Hebei Province, the incidence of puerperal fever in women in 1955 was 0.7%, which dropped to 0.2% in 1956; the incidence of newborn tetanus also dropped from 4.9% in 1955 to 1.2% in 1956. From the second half of 1955 to the first half of 1956, the Jialingjiang No. 1 Advanced Agricultural Cooperative in Zhaohua County, Sichuan Province, had a total of 99 infants born in the community. Among the 97 infants delivered by the new method, none suffered from tetanus. In the past, the mortality rate of infants delivered by the old method in this area due to tetanus often reached 50% to 60%. In addition, since last year, small maternity hospitals have also been established in some agricultural cooperatives with better conditions, so that women in difficulty can get more care and nursing during childbirth.

 Maternal and child health work in various ethnic minority areas has also been improved to varying degrees. According to statistics from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in November last year, a total of 179 maternal and child health stations and 3,000 delivery stations were established in the region, and more than 12,000 midwives were trained and reformed. On average, there is one midwife for about 87 households or 100 women of childbearing age, basically meeting the requirements of having a delivery station in every township and a midwife in every cooperative. In many places in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, according to the characteristics of pastoral areas, a method is adopted in which pregnant women go to the central delivery station one month before delivery and return home to work one month after delivery, so that women can get adequate rest before and after delivery, reduce premature births and postpartum morbidity, and also overcome the difficulty of pregnant women not being able to find a midwife while nomadic.

    新法接生进一步推广  产妇婴儿发病率减少
    农村妇幼卫生工作大有改善
    本报讯  农业的合作化对改进农村妇女和儿童的卫生福利事业创造了更多的有利条件。目前，各地特别对影响妇女儿童健康最大的落后的接生办法进行了改进，使历史上遗留下来的不注意产妇卫生的落后状况有了很大改善。
    从去年以来，全国各地为合作社训练了大批新法接生员。据江西、河南、江苏、山东、广东、甘肃、陕西等十七个省去年11月份的初步统计，共有接生员四十七万五千多人，比1955年全国的接生员多十六万三千多人。另外根据新疆、贵州、广西、安徽、内蒙古等十个省和自治区的初步统计，在农业合作化后新训练的接生员就有十三万八千多人。现在没有新法接生员的空白乡已经大大减少，山西省长治专区1955年还有三分之一的乡没有新法接生员，1956年已经没有空白乡了。
    由于广泛地推广了新法接生，新生儿因患破伤风和产妇因患产褥热而死亡的现象大大减少了。据河北省沧县专区的十个县统计，1955年妇女产褥热的发病率为0.7％，1956年降为0.2％；新生儿的破伤风发病率也由1955年的4.9％降为1956年的1.2％。四川省昭化县嘉陵江第一高级农业社从1955年下半年到1956年上半年，全社共出生婴儿九十九个，用新法接生的九十七个中没有一个患破伤风的。而这个地方过去用旧法接生的婴儿，因破伤风死亡的常常达到50％到60％。除此以外，从去年以来，在一些条件比较好的农业社里，还建立了小的产院，使有困难的妇女在生产时得到了更多的照顾和护理。
    各少数民族地区的妇幼卫生工作也有了不同程度的改善。据内蒙古自治区去年11月份的统计，全区共建立了妇幼保健站一百七十九处，接生站三千处，训练、改造了接生员一万二千多人。平均大约在八十七户、一百个生育年龄的妇女中就有一个接生员，基本上达到了乡乡有接生站、社社有接生员的要求。内蒙古自治区的许多地方还根据牧区的特点，采取产妇在产前一个月到中心接生站待产，产后一个月再回家劳动的办法，使妇女在生产前后能得到适当休息，减少了早产现象和产后的发病率，同时也克服了产妇在游牧中找不到接生员的困难。
