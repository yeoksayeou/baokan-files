    Xinhua News Agency, London, March 8th: A British Foreign Office spokesman revealed on the 7th that Japanese Ambassador Nishi Haruhiko had presented Britain with a formal protest from the Japanese government on the 4th, opposing Britain's hydrogen bomb test.

    This is the third time in just over a month that the Japanese government has demanded that Britain cancel its planned hydrogen bomb test on Christmas Island.

      The "Times" published an editorial entitled "Japan's Protest is Justified," expressing sympathy for the feelings of the Japanese people. However, the newspaper did not call for the cancellation of the hydrogen bomb test, but instead urged the government to propose a restriction on the number of nuclear tests immediately after the explosion. According to reports, this editorial caused unease among British government officials.

    Xinhua News Agency, London, March 8th: The Liberal Party on the 7th distributed to all Liberal Party branches a petition to Queen Elizabeth, requesting her to stop hydrogen bomb tests, and asked them to collect public signatures. The petition advocates "engaging in negotiations with other countries to plan and sign an international agreement so that they, like us, can cease such explosive tests."

    日本第三次照会英国
    要求取消氢弹试验计划
    据新华社8日讯　伦敦消息：英国外交部发言人7日透露，日本大使西春彦曾经在4日把日本政府反对英国试验氢弹的正式照会递交给英国。
    这是一个多月以来日本政府第三次要求英国取消计划在圣诞岛举行的氢弹试验。
      “泰晤士报”发表了一篇题为“日本抗议得对”的社论，对日本人的情绪表示同情。但是这家报纸并没有要求取消这次氢弹试验，而是要求政府在这次爆炸以后马上提出限制核子试验次数的建议。有消息说，这篇社论引起了英国政府人士的不安。
    据新华社8日讯　伦敦消息：自由党7日把送交伊丽莎白女王要求制止氢弹试验的请愿书分发给自由党全国各支部，要它们收集公众的签名。请愿书主张“同其他国家展开谈判，以求筹划和签订一项国际协定，使它们能同我们一样停止这种爆炸试验”。
