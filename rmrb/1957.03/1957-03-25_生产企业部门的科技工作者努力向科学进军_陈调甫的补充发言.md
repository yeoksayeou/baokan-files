Science and technology workers in production enterprises are not only an important force in the advancement towards science, but also a scientific commando team on the front line. Everyone knows its importance. According to my observation, since our wise and great leader Chairman Mao issued the call to advance towards science, the enthusiasm of science and technology workers in production enterprises (especially small and medium-sized enterprises) in responding to this call does not seem as warm as that of workers in research and teaching institutions. Upon careful analysis, there are many objective reasons. Mainly, there is not enough time, there are too many crash tasks, and they more or less have to take care of some administrative affairs, so that ordinary personnel cannot fully exert their potential and enthusiasm. However, if the "advancement" work of this team can never be rapidly and actively advanced, the entire "advancement" movement will be greatly affected, so that the advanced scientific level of various countries cannot be achieved as scheduled. I now put forward some methods for the reference of comrades in the production departments, and ask the members to criticize and correct them.

　　(1) Actively carry out the propaganda work of advancing towards science in the enterprise, and absorb the cooperation of workshop workers and administrative departments.

Advancing towards science is not only the responsibility of science and technology personnel, but also the responsibility of all the people. We must mobilize all forces from all aspects to move towards this goal in order to easily achieve the goal. Science and technology personnel in enterprises should first publicize the importance of advancing towards science for the construction of the motherland to workshop workers and administrative departments, express their willingness to learn from them, ask for their help and cooperation, and sincerely solicit their opinions. In this way, we can obtain a lot of scientific intelligence, clarify the advancement route, and directly and indirectly obtain many assistants. Workshop workers are the most familiar with all production issues and the most concerned about all production issues. From them, we can obtain many valuable data, and at the same time, we can do some experimental work through them to solve the problem of lack of assistants. As for other departments, such as accounting, purchasing, supply, sales, etc., they are also directly related to the advancement towards science; if they are willing to help, the advancement will be fast, and if they adopt a lukewarm attitude, the advancement speed will be slow, and even be subject to unnecessary obstacles. This subtle relationship is worth paying attention to. For example, if the purchase of materials and instruments is not carried out diligently, it may delay a lot of valuable time; if new products are trial-produced without the assistance of purchasing personnel, they may not be needed by the market after they are made, and those needed are not made, resulting in a closed-door approach.

　　(2) Contact colleagues in the same industry wholeheartedly, exchange experiences, and strive for division of labor and cooperation to save manpower and material resources.

The biggest difficulty in the advancement towards science in production enterprises is the lack of manpower and material resources, and the lack of time for personnel. If the entire industry can unite, clearly divide labor, and cooperate sincerely, then the problem of manpower and material resources can be solved at least in large part. Now there are often units of different sizes in an industry, some state-owned, some local state-owned, and some joint state-private. The coordination between each other does not seem to be close, and too much repetitive work is done. Some joint state-private units still retain some bourgeois ideas, like to do repetitive work, compete with each other, and have the intention of competing for fame and showing off, which is contrary to the socialist principle. Scientists doing repetitive work not only wastes too much, but also is more difficult to succeed. If several cobblers get together, they may become a Zhuge Liang, and success will be faster.

　　(3) Contact research and teaching institutions more to obtain their assistance.

Research institutions and institutions of higher learning have more talents and a higher theoretical level. Science and technology personnel in production units should humbly learn from them and establish contacts, which will benefit each other. Some people engaged in production are confident in their rich experience and do not like to interact with scientists who study theory, which is extremely wrong. Because production relies solely on practical experience, and the problem is not thoroughly solved theoretically, the foundation cannot be consolidated. Production units should often invite people from research and teaching institutions to make scientific reports, and provide them with research materials to assist students in colleges and universities to do graduation theses. In this way, the production team will be supported by many fresh troops, and the problem of few people can be solved at least in large part. In short, we must try every means to integrate the production department with the research department and the teaching department, so that the three armies of the scientific community will be closely combined and meet at the destination together. I believe that within twelve years, my country's scientific achievements will certainly reach the level of advanced countries.

　　(4) Do not forget the legacy of our ancestors when learning advanced technology.

Advancing towards science and learning advanced technology are certainly important, but some native methods left by our ancestors also have the value of promoting and developing, especially in this great movement of increasing production and practicing economy. It is also a contribution to the advancement towards science to make some improved native products with domestic raw materials to solve the current urgent needs. Here are a few examples:

　　(A) Ancient method of steelmaking and manufacturing swords. Ancient books say "cutting iron like mud, unparalleled sharpness", although some are exaggerated, there is also some accuracy. To this day, many places are known for making good knives. Metallurgists seem to have research value for the native method of steelmaking.

　　(B) In the inland areas with rapid currents, wooden water wheels are used as power. If they are slightly improved and some steel is used for the rotating parts, the efficiency can be increased to make up for the lack of power supply.

　　(C) Building houses and making rammed earth as foundations are solid and durable. This is our country's old method, and architects should conduct further research on this issue. At present, there is a shortage of cement. In Zhejiang, lime is mixed with soil and mixed with camphor tree leaf pulp to make tombs and pave the ground. It is as hard as concrete, so it is also worth studying to replace cement with lime.

　　(D) Tung oil is one of my country's national treasures. My country has been refining cooked tung oil for thousands of years, and it has become a habit to use it to paint houses, vehicles, and ships. The countryside likes to use it, and it is packaged in paper bags and bamboo baskets, so there is no need to use tinplate, which can save foreign exchange. However, when making cooked tung oil, workers must work hard to stir, sweating like rain, otherwise it will clump into glue and be difficult to use. We should improve the manufacturing method to improve the quality of tung oil and reduce labor intensity. This is an important work of the paint industry and is worth paying attention to. The output of cooked tung oil may be higher than the output of chemical paint in the country, which is worth detailed investigation by the authorities. It is heard from people from Hunan that in recent years, tung seeds have fallen to the ground and no one collects them, and the purchase price of tung oil is low, and tung trees have been cut down. The United States has planted tung trees for decades without success, and is it not painful for our country to waste things like this? I hope that domestic chemists will pay attention to this natural synthetic precious material before studying organic synthesis.

　　(E) Inner Mongolia and other places produce natural alkali and beef and mutton oil. If cold method is used to make soap, it can be made without new machines and foreign raw materials for rural washing. The products of Yongli Alkali Factory are now sold well abroad. If we can use some native alkali instead of chemical alkali, we can increase the export quantity and earn foreign exchange.

There are many other similar problems. Most of my country's handmade native products are artistic. If they are made scientific, they may make a great contribution, and there is no need to add large machines to build large factories, which is in line with the meaning of increasing production and practicing economy.

In addition, there are still several existing problems that I would like to mention in passing.

　　(1) The issue of scientific advancement in joint state-private enterprises

If the private party in a joint state-private enterprise is also an intellectual engaged in science and technology work, he has a dual identity to be transformed. When doing scientific research work, he must be extra cautious, particularly patient, and sincerely unite with the public party, patiently and tactfully explain in detail, and must not show any impatience. Even so, this type of private party has encountered difficulties more or less in the past. Now the situation has changed, but the situation where the private party puts forward rationalization proposals and is not adopted by the public party, as Comrade Zhu Jisheng said, still exists, and it is hoped that it can be slowly eliminated.

The main thing is to rely on the private party's own hard work and produce results to win the public party's trust and change the workers' views. If the private party has the enthusiasm of loving science and loving the motherland, of course, they can try every means to persuade the public party, and will not stop until they achieve their goals.

　　(2) The issue of new products and old products

Now the leadership encourages the production department to produce more new products, which is very correct. However, there is a lack of clear definition of what a new product is. The degree of difficulty in making new products also varies greatly. Many new products must go through long-term and in-depth research before they can be successful. There are also many new products that can be successful with a little brainstorming and changing the soup without changing the medicine. What's more, there are many products that are taken out of formulas from more than a decade ago and repeatedly manufactured and called new products, which is not appropriate to boast about. The most serious point is that while promoting new products, it is easy to forget old products. Everyone likes to do the work of trial-producing new products and does not like to do the work of improving old products. As a result, new products may not be successful, and the quality of old products will decline. This is an important key that cannot be ignored.

　　(3) The issue of bonuses

Some leaders give cash rewards to people who have made new products in order to stimulate the enthusiasm of science and technology personnel. This further打击了the emotions of those engaged in improving old products. Moreover, the bonus cannot be awarded universally. Laboratory personnel have it, but workshop personnel and other participating personnel (such as those who purchase raw materials and sell finished products) do not have it, which may cause misunderstandings from all parties. I suggest canceling this bonus. If there is a special invention, it can be handled on a case-by-case basis. If material rewards are used, the winners should be more widespread, because the achievements of scientific research depend entirely on the assistance of the masses, and cannot be achieved by science and technology workers alone.

　　生产企业部门的科技工作者努力向科学进军
　　陈调甫的补充发言
    生产企业部门的科技工作者，非但是向科学进军中的一支重要队伍，并且是在最前线的一支科学冲锋队，它的重要性是人人都知道的。据我的观察，自从英明伟大的领袖毛主席发出了向科学进军号召以来，生产企业部门（尤其是中小型的企业）中的科技工作人员响应这个号召的情绪，似没有研究和教学机关工作人员热烈。细细分析，客观原因很多，主要是由于时间不够，突击任务太多，或多或少还须兼顾一些行政事务工作，以致一般人员还不能充分发挥它们的潜在力和积极性。但是这支队伍的“进军”工作，倘使永远不能迅速地积极地向前迈进，整个“进军”运动，必受到巨大影响，以致不能如期达到先进各国的科学水平。我现在提出一些办法，以备生产部门的同志参考，请各位委员批评指正。
      （1）积极地在本企业内做好向科学进军的宣传工作，吸收车间职工及事务部门人员的协作。
    向科学进军，不单独是科技人员的责任，也是全体人民的责任，必须动员各方面一切力量，向此目标迈进，才容易达到目的。企业中的科技人员，首先应向车间职工及事务部门人员宣传向科学进军对于祖国建设的重要性，表示愿向他们学习，请求他们帮助和合作，并极诚恳地征求他们的意见。这样一来，就可以得到许多科学情报，明确进军路线，直接间接地得到了许多助手。车间职工，是最熟悉生产方面一切问题的人，也是最关心生产方面一切问题之人，由他们中间，可以得到许多宝贵资料，同时亦可以通过他们，做一部分试验工作，以解决助手缺乏的问题。至于其他部门，如会计、采购、供应、推销等等，对于向科学进军亦有直接联系的；他们乐意帮助，进军就快，他们如采取半温半冷的态度，进军速度就慢，甚至会受到不必要的障碍。这种微妙关系，值得深刻注意的。例如采购材料仪器，倘不努力进行，可能耽误很多的宝贵时间；试制新产品，倘没有采购人员协助，可能制成后市场不需要，而需要的没有制，造成闭门造车现象。
      （2）全心全意地与同业同行联系，交流经验，努力争取分工合作，以节省人力物力。
    生产企业部门向科学进军中的最大困难，是人力物力不够，人员的时间不够。倘使全行业能团结起来，明确分工，竭诚合作，那末，人力物力问题至少大部分可以解决了。现在一个行业往往有大小不同的单位，有的国营，有的地方国营，有的公私合营，彼此间协调关系，似还没有搞得密切，做的重复工作太多。有的公私合营单位，仍保留一部分资产阶级思想，喜欢做重复工作，彼此竞争，有争名出风头的意思，这是违背社会主义原则的。科学家做重复工作，非但浪费太多，并且成功亦较难，如果几个皮匠凑在一起，亦许就会变成一个诸葛亮，成功就较快了。
      （3）多与研究、教学机关联系，取得他们的助力。
    研究机关、高等院校，人才较多，理论水平较高，生产单位的科技人员应虚心地多向他们学习，取得联系，彼此均有益处。有一部分从事生产的人员，自负经验丰富，不大喜欢同研究理论的科学家来往，这是极不对的。因为生产单凭实际经验，不从理论上彻底解决问题，基础不能巩固下来的。生产单位最好常请研究、教学机关人士来做科学报告，并供给他们研究资料，协助高等院校学生做结业论文。这样一来，生产方面的队伍，就得到许多生力军的支援了，人少问题，至少可解决一大部分了。总之我们必需想尽一切方法把生产部门和研究部门及教学部门打成一片，使科学界三军，密切结合起来，一同向目的地会师，我相信十二年内，我国的科学成绩，一定可以达到先进各国的水平。
      （4）学习先进技术不要忘记祖宗遗产。
    向科学进军，学习先进技术，固然重要，然而我们祖宗遗留下来一些土法，亦有发扬光大的价值，尤其在此增产节约的大运动中，就国产原料，制一些改良土产，以解决目前急切的需要，也是向科学进军中的一种贡献，今略举几个例子如下：
      （甲）古法炼钢，制造刀剑，古书传说“砍铁如泥，锋利无比”，虽有些夸大，亦有一些准确性，至今有许多地方，以善制刀闻，冶金学家，对于炼钢铁土法似有研究价值。
      （乙）内地有急水流泉的地方，用木制水轮，作为动力，如稍为改良，转动部分改用一些钢铁，似可增加效能，以补救电力供应之不足。
      （丙）盖屋打灰土作地基，坚固耐久，这是我国老法，建筑师对此问题，似应作进一步研究。目前水泥缺乏，浙江地方用石灰与土搀拌加茑樟树叶浆舂捣后作坟及铺地之用，坚硬不下于混凝土，所以用石灰代替水泥，也值得研究的。
      （丁）桐油为我国国宝之一。我国制炼熟桐油已数千年，用以涂饰房屋车辆船只，久成习惯，农村喜用，且用纸袋竹篓包装，不必用马口铁，可以节省外汇。惟制熟桐油时，工人须努力搅拌，挥汗如雨，否则结块成胶，难以使用。我们应把制法改良，以提高桐油质量，减少劳动强度，这是油漆工业的重要工作，值得注意，熟桐油产量，可能比全国化学漆的产量还高，值得当局详细调查的。闻湖南来人说：近年来桐子落地，无人收取，收购桐油价低，桐树都被砍伐，美国植桐数十年，未有成绩，而我国人这样暴殄天物岂不痛心？望国内化学家在研究有机合成之前，先注意这种天然合成的宝贵材料。
      （戊）内蒙古及其他地方产天然碱亦产牛羊油，如用冷法制成肥皂，不必用新式机器与外来原料，即可制成，供农村洗涤之用。现在永利碱厂出品，畅销国外，如我们能用一部分土碱代替化学碱，则可增加出口数量，换取外汇。
    其他类此的问题很多，我国手工土产，大都有艺术性的，把它们科学化一下，可能作出巨大的贡献，并且不需要添大机器盖大工厂，正合增产节约的意义。
    此外还有几个存在的问题，我顺便提出来。
      （一）公私合营企业中的科学进军问题
    公私合营企业中的私方，如他同时亦是一个搞科技工作的知识分子，他就有了双重被改造的身份，做起科学研究工作来，就必需格外慎重，特别耐心，与公方切实团结，不惮烦劳地详细婉转说明，不可稍露急躁情绪。虽然如此，以前这一类的私方，是或多或少遭遇到困难的，现在情势转变了，然而像朱继圣同志所说的私方提出合理化建议不蒙公方采纳的情形，至今还存在，希望慢慢可以消灭。
    主要还是靠私方自己努力工作，做出结果来，以博得公方的信心，且改变职工的观感。私方如有热爱科学热爱祖国的热忱，当然能委曲求全想出千方百计说服公方，不达目的不止。
      （二）新产品与旧产品问题
    现在领导方面，鼓励生产部门多制新产品，这是很对的。但是新产品的定义如何，缺乏明确规定。制成新产品的难易的程度，亦大有区别，有许多新产品，须经过长期深刻的研究，始能成功，亦有许多新产品，稍稍开动脑筋，换汤不换药，即可成功。更有许多产品，拿出十几年前配方，重复制造一下，亦称为新产品，以此自夸，殊不恰当。最严重一点，是提倡了新产品，同时容易忘记了旧产品，大家都喜欢做试制新产品工作，不喜欢做改进旧产品工作，结果可能新产品没有成就，旧产品质量下降，这是一个重要的关键，不可忽视。
      （三）奖励金问题
    有的领导上面，为了刺激科技人员的积极性，给予制成新产品人员现金奖励，这样一来更打击了从事改良旧产品人员的情绪。并且奖金颁发不能普遍，试验室人员有，而车间人员以及其他参加工作人员
  （如采购原料推销成品的人员）没有，可能引起各方的误会。我建议把这种奖金取消。如真有特殊发明，可以专案办理，倘用物质奖励方法，得奖者应普遍一些，因为研究科学的成绩全赖群众的协助，不是科技工作者单干所能造成的。
