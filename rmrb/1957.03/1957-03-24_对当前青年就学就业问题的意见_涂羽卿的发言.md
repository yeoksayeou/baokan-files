Allow me to express some opinions on the current employment and education issues for young people. Please offer your criticisms and suggestions.

In this meeting, we have heard that a considerable number of children will not be able to attend school after this summer vacation. Primary school graduates will not be able to enter junior high school, junior high school graduates will not be able to enter senior high school, and senior high school graduates will not be able to enter university. At the same time, Vice Premier Li stated in his report that the average number of employed workers each year during the second five-year plan will be approximately 1 million. Therefore, the employment and education issues for young people have become a relatively serious problem and one that we should all be very concerned about.

Young people are the reserve force for our country's socialist construction and the nation's most valuable asset. Since the arrival of the socialist revolution's high tide, the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce has achieved a basic victory, and agricultural collectivization has developed rapidly throughout the country. Especially after the Party and government put forward the call to advance towards science, the socialist enthusiasm of young people has reached an unprecedented high. The demand for culture, technology, and employment to participate in the construction of the motherland has also emerged as a high tide. This demand is entirely correct and should be given deep sympathy and vigorous encouragement. However, due to our country's large population and relatively backward economic conditions, there is a contradiction in a certain period between the country's construction and the improvement of the people's material and cultural lives and demands. Chairman Mao teaches us that this is a contradiction among the people, a non-antagonistic contradiction. As long as we have a correct understanding of this contradiction and work together, the problem can be reasonably resolved.

I would like to offer my personal views on the current employment and education issues for young people for everyone's criticism and correction.

	1. The Essence of the Problem

If we compare before and after liberation, we can clearly see the essence of the problem and the guarantee of solving it. From a quantitative perspective, since liberation, education and other construction endeavors, like other construction undertakings, have undergone unprecedented development. Vice Premier Li stated in his report that the number of higher education graduates during the first five-year plan will be 1.3 times the total number of graduates in the thirty-six years before liberation (i.e., more than 270,000). The development of primary and secondary schools will be even more astonishing. In terms of employment, according to Vice Premier Chen Yun's speech, more than 2.2 million new workers were added nationwide in 1956. Together with the 600,000+ from secondary technical schools and technical training classes, there are a total of more than 2.8 million workers who are either already employed or preparing for employment. In terms of our country's current economic conditions, this is a considerable number. This fact fully illustrates the essence of the problem. The reactionary ruling class disregards the interests of the people, while the people's government is always thinking of the people and making the greatest efforts to meet the needs of the people.

From a qualitative perspective, graduation before liberation meant unemployment. So-called education was nothing more than a decoration. Today, there is a world of difference. All undertakings and measures are for socialist construction. The country's construction and the interests of the people are completely consistent. Construction is to seek the happiness of the people, education is for employment, and the interests of the individual and the interests of the country are consistent. The current interests and the long-term interests are also consistent. Although there are certain difficulties at present, we should have full confidence that, under the policy of overall planning, appropriate arrangements, seeking truth from facts, and steady progress, difficulties can be overcome, and the problem can be appropriately resolved with the development of the national economy.

	2. The Truth of the Problem

Education must be closely linked to economic development, must be suitable for the current needs of economic construction, and must serve the country's construction. From this perspective, I fully agree with Vice Premier Li's view. In a certain period (which I believe is a fairly long period), our education system will inevitably be pyramid-shaped. It is impossible for all primary school students to automatically advance through the grades. According to the second five-year plan, the number of students in higher education institutions may reach 800,000, that is, an average of about 160,000 per grade. If every child born this year were to attend university, higher education institutions would have to enroll more than 10 million students each year. This is obviously impossible and completely unnecessary. Therefore, if everyone recognizes the reality of the pyramid-shaped education system, recognizes that there is an irreconcilable contradiction between the ideal of the right to enjoy higher education and its realization under the current circumstances, the issue of education, at least the issue of education for graduates above primary school, should not become a serious problem. The issue of children entering school is another matter.

The nature of the employment problem has both similarities and differences. According to Vice Premier Li's report, "Arranging a large labor force is a major issue." As the national economy develops, the number of employees can gradually increase each year, but it is obviously somewhat difficult to hope to completely solve the youth employment problem in the near future. However, many young people who cannot go on to further education and are not readily able to find employment will become a serious social problem. Therefore, the focus of the problem is on employment, not education, and the employment problem must be properly arranged. Since 80% of our country's population is in rural areas and industrialization has only just begun, the focus of employment should be in rural areas. I fully support Vice Premier Li's suggestion that labor should primarily be arranged in rural areas and secondarily in cities. Of course, we believe that the relevant government departments will definitely follow Chairman Mao's instructions, take overall planning into account, make appropriate arrangements, and take all possible measures to solve the problem as much as possible. However, it is also impossible for the government to solve the entire, 100% employment problem under the current circumstances.

	3. Specific Suggestions

	(1) The issue of children's education. This is fundamentally an issue of universal education. According to statistics, there are currently 63 million primary school students nationwide. If calculated on an average five-year system, there are currently an average of approximately 12.6 million students per grade in primary schools. This means that if the two-part system continues to be implemented and promoted, even if the number of children entering school increases by 12.6 million (2% of 630 million) each year, the current primary schools can handle the regular task of children entering school for a short period. What needs to be solved is the problem of children who should be in school now but are not. I suggest considering the following measures to solve this as much as possible:

	A. Postpone school entry by one or two years. Rural and urban areas can be handled separately. This can reduce some of the pressure.

	B. Increase the number of primary schools year by year according to the country's economic strength. The second five-year plan must have already taken this issue into account.

	C. Under the unified leadership of local education administrative institutions and through the promotion of local CPPCCs, use cooperatives, various urban agencies, organizations, and residents' committees to utilize all possible time, housing, and equipment to run small, informal primary schools. The curriculum is basically the same as regular primary schools, but it may take more years to complete. The method should have considerable flexibility. Teachers can consider utilizing current junior and senior high school graduates who cannot continue their education.

	D. If necessary and possible, the length of primary education can also be considered to promote the resolution of the problem.

These measures can not only solve the current problem of children's education but also solve the overall problem of universal education. If our country completes universal education within the next five years, it would be another miracle in the world.

	(2) Employment Issues.

The employment issue is a relatively big issue and will be a regular issue for a certain period, not only the employment issue of young people who cannot continue their education at present, but also the issue every year from now on. It should be pointed out that this issue is closely related to the population birth rate. Therefore, vigorously promoting birth control is the most effective way to solve this problem. It must also be pointed out that promoting it is the government's responsibility, and whether or not to implement it seriously is everyone's own responsibility. Not only to solve the employment problem, but also to accelerate socialist industrialization, to enable the people to obtain the improvement in life they deserve, and for the happiness of the next generation, birth control is also completely necessary (except in ethnic minority areas). This is publicity and education number one.

Facing the countryside, facing labor. Under the current circumstances, only by facing the countryside can the employment problem be basically solved. Only the countryside has a large enough employment surface. There is no doubt that most of the employment in rural areas will be labor employment. Therefore, labor education is publicity and education number two.

In order for the problem to be effectively solved, the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy, and building the country through diligence and frugality is also necessary. The superiority of socialism is certain, and the prospects of socialism are extremely beautiful, but the road to socialism is arduous. This is publicity and education number three.

Chairman Mao said that the contradictions among the people should not be dealt with by crude methods, but by detailed, patient persuasion. Parents, it is completely wrong to crudely blame their children for not being able to continue their education. Forcing young people to face the countryside and face labor is wrong and impossible. Young people have a high level of socialist consciousness, and persuasive education is entirely possible.

In addition to actively carrying out the above publicity and education work, I would also like to suggest the following measures to help solve part of the employment problem.

	(1) Make full use of primary school graduates to participate in literacy work after short-term training.

	(2) Utilize rural primary and junior high school graduates to engage in agricultural and sideline production and pay them appropriately according to their labor.

	(3) Hold various cultural tutoring classes to prepare some young people for further education and adopt appropriate entrance exams. Academic performance can be used as one of the conditions for future further education to encourage them.

	(4) Hold various short-term cultural, recreational and sports training classes (such as music, dance, drama, art, fitness, ball games, swimming, etc.) as recreational activities on the one hand, and as preparation for employment on the other.

	(5) Hold various short-term technical training classes (such as carpentry, electrical work, ironwork, tap water, sanitation equipment, sewing, nursery service, etc.). Equipment should avoid mechanization as much as possible. Teachers can make full use of older workers, high-level students in universities, housewives, and intellectuals who have not yet found employment. Encourage voluntary or semi-voluntary work as much as possible to achieve the purpose of running classes diligently and frugally and reducing the burden on the country. (Attached picture)

　　对当前青年就学就业问题的意见
　　涂羽卿的发言
    请允许我对当前青年的就学就业问题发表一些意见，请批评指教。
    在这次会议里，我们听到今年暑假后将有相当多的儿童不能入学，高小毕业生不能入初中，初中毕业生不能入高中，高中毕业生不能入大学。同时李副总理在他的报告中说，在第二个五年计划内，每年平均的就业职工人数将在100万左右，因此青年的就学就业问题就成为一个比较严重的问题，也是我们大家应当很关心的问题。
    青年是我国社会主义建设的后备军，是国家最宝贵的财富，自从社会主义革命高潮到来，资本主义工商业社会主义改造取得了基本胜利，农业合作化在全国范围内突飞猛进地发展，特别在党和政府提出向科学进军的号召以后，青年的社会主义热情有了空前的高涨，要求文化、要求技术、要求就业参加祖国的建设，也出现了一个高潮。这个要求是完全正确的，应当予以深厚的同情和有力的鼓励。但是由于我国人口众多，经济条件还比较落后，在一定的时期内，国家的建设与人民物质文化生活的提高和要求之间是有矛盾的，毛主席教导我们，这是人民内部的矛盾，是一个非对抗性的矛盾。只要我们对于这个矛盾有正确的认识，大家共同努力，问题可以得到合理的解决。
    我愿意将我个人对当前青年的就学就业问题的看法提供大家批评指正。
        1、问题的本质
    如果我们拿解放前后作一对比，就很清楚地看出问题的本质和解决问题的保证，从量方面看，自从解放以来，教育事业和其他建设事业一样，有了史无前例的发展。李副总理在报告中说，第一个五年计划的高等学校毕业生数将为解放前三十六年毕业生总数的1.3倍（即27万余人）。中小学的发展将更为惊人。在就业方面，据陈云副总理的发言，1956年全国增加了新职工220余万人，再加上中等技术学校和技工训练班的60余万人，共有已经就业和准备就业的职工280余万人。就我国目前的经济条件而论，这是一个相当大的数目，这种事实充分说明了问题的本质。反动统治阶级是不顾人民利益的，人民政权是处处为人民着想的、尽最大的努力来满足人民的需要的。
    从质方面看，解放以前毕业就是失业。所谓教育只不过是一种装饰而已，今天就有了天壤之别。各种事业、各种措施，都是为了社会主义建设，国家的建设与人民的利益是完全一致的，建设就是为谋求人民的幸福，就学就是为了就业，个人的利益与国家的利益是一致的，目前的利益和长远的利益也是一致的。虽然目前有一定的困难，我们应当有充分的信心，在统筹兼顾、适当安排、实事求是、稳步前进的方针下，困难是可以克服的，问题可以随着国民经济的发展得到适当的解决。
        2、问题的真相
    教育事业必须密切结合经济的发展，必须适合当前经济建设的需要，并且应当为国家的建设服务。从这个角度来看，我完全同意李副总理的看法。在一定的时期内（我认为是一个相当长的时期）我们的教育制度，必然是宝塔式的。所有的小学生必不可能一律顺序的升学，根据第二个五年计划，高等学校的在校学生可能达到80万人，即每班平均16万人左右。今年生的儿童，若每人都要入大学的话，高等学校将要每年招生一千多万人。这显然是不可能的，也是完全不必要的。因此，若是大家认识到宝塔式教育制度的现实性，认识到享受高等教育的权利的理想和实现之间在目前的情况下还存在着不可统一的矛盾，就学问题，至少是小学以上毕业生的就学问题就不应当成为一个严重的问题，儿童入学问题则另当别论。
    就业问题的性质有相同之处也有不同之处，据李副总理的报告，“安排大量劳动力是个大问题。”将随着国民经济的发展，每年就业的职工可以逐步增长，但是希望在不久的将来能完全解决青年就业问题，显然是有些困难的。然而有许多青年既不能升学，又不比较能就业，就将成为一个严重的社会问题。因此问题的重点在就业，不在就学，而就业问题必须有妥善的安排。由于我国的80％的人口在农村，工业化才刚开始，因此就业的重点应在农村。我完全拥护李副总理的建议，劳动力应只能先在农村多安排，城市少安排。当然我们相信政府的有关部门一定会遵照毛主席的指示，统筹兼顾，适当安排，采取一切可能的措施，尽可能解决问题。但是希望政府在目前的情况下解决，包干整个的，百分之百的就业问题也是不可能的。
        3、具体的建议
      （一）儿童的就学问题。基本上这是普及教育问题。据统计，全国目前共有小学生6，300万人。若以平均五年制计算，小学校目前每班平均约有1，260万人，这就是说，若继续执行和推广二部制，即使每年增加儿童1，260万（6.3亿的2％）目前的小学可以担负一个短时期内儿童入学的经常任务。所需要设法解决的是现在应当入学而尚未入学的儿童的入学问题。我建议考虑以下的措施来尽量的解决：
    甲、推迟一年或二年入学，农村和城市可以分别处理，这样可以减少一部分的压力。
    乙、根据国家经济的力量逐年增加小学的数量，第二个五年计划一定已经考虑到这个问题。
    丙、由各地教育行政机构统一领导，通过地方政协的推动，利用合作社、城市各机关、团体、居民委员会，运用一切可能运用的时间、房屋、设备，举办小型的非正规小学。课程基本上与正规小学相同，但可能需要更多的年限方可完成。办法要有相当大的灵活性，师资可以考虑利用现在不能升学的初高中毕业生。
    丁、如有必要和可能，也可考虑小学教育的年限问题，以俾促进问题的解决。
    这些措施不但可以解决目前的儿童就学问题，也可同时解决全面的普及教育问题。若在今后的五年之内完成我国的普及教育，那就是世界上的另一奇迹。
      （二）就业问题。
    就业问题是一个比较大的问题，而且在一定的时期内将是一个经常性的问题，不单是目前不能升学的青年的就业问题，而是今后每年的问题。应当指出，这个问题与人口的生育率有密切的关系。因此，大力的提倡节育，是解决这个问题最有效的办法。也须指出，提倡是政府的责任，认真贯彻与否是人民每一个人自己的责任，不仅是为了解决就业问题，为了加速社会主义工业化，为了使人民得到应有的生活的提高，为了后一代的幸福，节育也是完全必要的，（除了少数民族地区外）这是宣传教育之一。
    面向农村、面向劳动，在目前情况下，只有面向农村方可基本上解决就业问题，只有农村才有足够大的就业面。毫无疑问，在农村就业，大部分将是劳动就业，因此，劳动教育是宣传教育之二。
    为要使问题得到有效的解决，增产节约，勤俭建国的精神也是必要的，社会主义的优越性是肯定的，社会主义的远景是极其美丽的，但是走向社会主义的路程是艰巨的，这是宣传教育之三。
    毛主席说，处理人民内部的矛盾不可用粗暴的方法，而是要细致的、耐心说服的方法，家长们，因为子弟不能升学，就加以粗暴的责难，这是完全错误的，勉强青年面向农村、面向劳动是错误的也是不可能的。青年们的社会主义觉悟是高的，说服教育是完全可能的。
    除了积极进行以上的宣传教育工作外，我还愿意建议以下的措施，协助解决部分的就业问题。
    （一）充分利用高小毕业生，经过短期的训练参加扫盲工作。
    （二）利用农村高小、初中毕业生从事农副业生产，并酌量按照其劳动予以报酬。
    （三）举办各种文化补习班以作部分青年的升学准备，并采用适当的入班考试。学习成绩可作为以后升学条件之一，以资鼓励。
    （四）举办各种短期文娱体育训练班（如音乐、舞蹈、戏剧、美术、健身、球类、游泳等），一方面作为文娱活动，另一方面作为就业的准备。
    （五）举办各种短期技术训练班（如木工、电工、铁工、自来水、卫生设备，缝纫、托儿所服务员等），设备应尽量避免机械化，师资可以充分利用老年工人、高等学校高班生、家庭妇女和尚未就业的知识分子。尽可能鼓励义务或半义务性的工作，以达到勤俭办班的目的，减轻国家的负担。（附图片）
