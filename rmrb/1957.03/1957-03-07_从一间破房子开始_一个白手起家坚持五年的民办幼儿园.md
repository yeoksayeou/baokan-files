    Starting from a Dilapidated House
    A Privately Run Kindergarten Persisting for Five Years Through Self-Reliance
    By Our Correspondent Zhang Jing

    In our country, there are countless diligent and intelligent women, scattered in every corner, laboring silently. However, their labor, like stars, shines with an undying light throughout the year.

    Li Tai-rao and the Yongjian Kindergarten she loves, introduced here, are just one example of the thousands upon thousands of ordinary achievements.

    Yongjian Kindergarten is located in the middle of a small alley inside Zhonghua Gate in Nanjing. It has a total of six rooms. In the children's activity room, there are various small stools, sandboxes, wooden horses, and rocking boats. Paper flowers and children's health posters are pasted on the walls. Although each room is simply decorated, it looks very organized and clean. It's hard to imagine that in these few rooms, more than two hundred and fifty children are being educated and cared for every day.

    Yongjian Kindergarten's current situation is hard-earned. From its opening to the present, for more than five years, it has not received any government subsidies. It relies on the support of the surrounding masses and the diligent efforts of its staff, starting from a dilapidated house and gradually developing.

    The predecessor of Yongjian Kindergarten was the nursery station of the Yingfu Street Women's Congress, which was established in the winter of 1951 to mobilize housewives to participate in social activities. The person who organized it was Li Tai-rao, the director of the Yingfu Street Women's Congress, who is now the director of Yongjian Kindergarten.

    Starting a business is inherently difficult, and starting from scratch is especially so. Running a nursery station encountered difficulties everywhere: first of all, there was no house. Where to settle the children? Li Tai-rao finally found an empty house in Jianzi Lane, but it had no roof, no floor, incomplete doors and windows, and was drafty in all directions, worse than a chicken coop. If it were to be repaired, there wasn't even a penny of start-up funds. What to do? Li Tai-rao went home and took down all the partition walls and sleeping planks in her room, and found Zhang Jia-kun, a carpenter and activist in the residential section, and asked him to repair it as a voluntary service. But how could he start without nails? Li Tai-rao then mobilized the women in her section to make a pair of shoe soles each, and she herself rushed to make two pairs overnight, raising just over two yuan in wages. Half of this money was used to buy nails, barely fixing up a dilapidated house, and the rest was used as the nursery station's "start-up fund" to buy some candy and paper. All other necessary supplies were borrowed from nearby residents, and the children brought their own small stools, towels, and teacups. In this way, twenty-two children were admitted in the first phase.

    However, not having money could not be sustained for long. Seeing that the children had no candy, Li Tai-rao went home and found a few old things, sold them without telling everyone, and bought some candy and boiled water to send to the nursery station. As for herself, because life was difficult at that time, she sometimes dug up wild vegetables on the outskirts of the city and mixed them into porridge to satisfy her hunger. This was discovered by a child's parent, and when it spread, everyone was very moved. Later, the parents voluntarily contributed a dime or five cents for candy. This money became the nursery station's funding, which lasted for more than a year.

    By 1953, the number of children had increased to more than sixty. One room was really too crowded, and many parents were still asking to send their children in. Li Tai-rao had to find a house in every possible way, and later at No. 64 Santiaoying (the current site), she found one and a half rooms. This one and a half rooms were also dilapidated and unable to keep out the wind and rain. But after all, there was half a room more. Li Tai-rao negotiated with the landlord, and then she and several female activists started working on their own, spending a few days cleaning it up and repairing it neatly, and moving the children from Jianzi Lane here. From this time on, the nursery station began to have a few fixed staff members. Each child paid five cents a month, and the nursery station had a normal income.

    It seemed that the difficulties were just beginning, and new problems followed one after another. In the same building as the nursery station, there were also four or five other families living. With more than sixty children moving in, making noise all day long, it would naturally disrupt their original way of life. After the nursery station moved in, there were almost daily disturbances. Either someone's water tank was overturned, or someone's chicks were crushed to death. Even if the teachers kept the doors closed all day, how could they restrain the children's nature? In this situation, either the children had to move out, or the neighbors had to be persuaded to move, there was no other way. Li Tai-rao had to find a way out again, first finding a good house, and then persuading the neighbors to exchange with them, until 1955, when she managed to acquire the whole piece of six rooms as it is now, and the children had a few relatively spacious activity rooms.

    Having a house and a certain income, of course, requires a thrifty and calculating housekeeper. Before June 1954, although Li Tai-rao had put her heart and soul into organizing the nursery station and had made great efforts, she also had to be responsible for the work of the Women's Congress, and the administrative management of the nursery station had never been on the right track. On June 24, 1954, the higher authorities officially decided that Li Tai-rao should be responsible for the work of the nursery station.

    At that time, she saw that the walls of the house were blackened by coal smoke. The children often had patches of black oily ash on their bodies. She wanted to find a plasterer to whitewash it, but after calculating, it would cost at least thirty yuan for labor and materials. Li Tai-rao was reluctant to spend this money. She took a Sunday, found an acquaintance who was a plasterer, learned the method of whitewashing walls from him, bought the materials herself, and mobilized the teachers in the kindergarten to do it themselves. As a result, it only cost three yuan, and by using one Sunday and a few days of spare time, all the walls in the kindergarten were whitewashed and looked brand new.

    The number of children in the kindergarten was increasing day by day. How could they not feel bored staying in the small activity room all day? Li Tai-rao had already planned this for the children. Behind the house, there was a relatively large courtyard, which was square and suitable for making a small playground for the children. But it was because there were several piles of garbage in the yard, which no one had dared to touch for many years, and they had been piled higher and higher, almost like small mountains. Li Tai-rao discussed it with the staff in the kindergarten and encouraged everyone to dig it out themselves. All seven staff members in the kindergarten really started working. Their spirit moved the children's parents, and some parents volunteered to help. Sure enough, in less than two weeks, this garbage mountain was conquered by them.

    However, the new playground brought new demands: how nice it would be to have some large toys on the playground! One day, Li Tai-rao went to a sports equipment store to inquire, and was told that a slide, a rocking boat, a seesaw, and a rocking horse would cost 150 yuan just for these four items. This number simply shocked Li Tai-rao! Later, she bought wood from a lumberyard herself, and negotiated with residents nearby who had large carts, promising to exchange labor by knitting sweaters and doing needlework for them, and asked them to transport the materials to the sports equipment factory to have them custom-made. This saved a sum of transportation costs. In terms of the price of the custom-made items, she helped the factory to calculate carefully, and as a result, these four items were made successfully for a total of only eighty-one yuan.

    There are countless examples of not spending money, spending less money, and doing things oneself in Yongjian Kindergarten. The sand that the children played with was carried back in bags by the teachers, and they also found ways to wash it themselves. The mud boards that the children used for homework were made from the wooden boards of old soap boxes. The toys that the children played with, such as dolls, puppies, white rabbits, and big-nosed elephants, were also made by the teachers from scraps of cloth and waste materials.

    Because of their frugality, although each child only pays seven cents a month now, in addition to supplying the children with candy and snacks, the kindergarten has also added many necessary furniture and toys one after another. All the things that were borrowed at the beginning have been returned to their original owners. Recently, fifty small chairs have been added. There is now a surplus of 625 yuan.

    The children's lives are becoming richer and more colorful day by day. What about the staff of the kindergarten? From the director of the kindergarten to the teachers and nannies, they have always maintained the traditional style of diligence and thrift. They arrive at the kindergarten at 6:30 at the latest every morning and work until 5:30 in the afternoon. Every day at noon and in the afternoon, regardless of the hot summer or cold winter, regardless of whether it is windy or rainy, the teachers in each class are responsible for taking each child home for meals and rest. Sometimes during the rainy season, heavy rain floods the entrance, and the director and teachers take off their shoes and carry the young children home one by one. They also have to make a general home visit once a week to solicit the opinions of parents and understand the effect of education. There are no odd-job workers in the kindergarten, so they take turns being responsible for cleaning. The work is quite hard. However, the staff in the kindergarten are all semi-voluntary. They only receive a living allowance of seven to ten yuan per month. In the past five years, there has never been an accident or an infectious disease in this kindergarten, and several children have also been praised by the neighborhood committee. Just these few things are enough to let us know the achievements of this kindergarten in childcare work.

    从一间破房子开始
    一个白手起家坚持五年的民办幼儿园
    本报记者　张竞
    在我们的国家里，有多少勤俭而聪慧的妇女，她们散布在每个角落里，默默无闻地劳动着。然而，她们的劳动，却像星星一样，终年闪耀着不灭的光辉。
    这里介绍的李泰铙同志和她所热爱的永坚幼儿园，正是千千万万平凡的业迹中的一例。
    永坚幼儿园设在南京市中华门内一条小巷子的中段，共有六间房子。在小孩活动室里，摆着各式各样的小板凳和沙箱、木马、摇船。壁上贴着纸花和儿童卫生宣传画。每一个房间虽然布置得很简单，看上去却很有条理，很整洁。真想不到，就在这几间屋子里，每天有二百五十多个孩子在这里受着教养。
    永坚幼儿园能有今天这样的景况，是很不容易的。它从开办到如今，五年多来，没有接受过政府津贴，它是依靠着周围群众的支持和工作人员的勤俭努力，从一间破房子开始，慢慢发展起来的。
    永坚幼儿园的前身是膺福街妇代会的托儿站，那时是1951年冬天，为了动员家庭妇女参加社会活动而筹办起来的。筹办的人就是膺福街妇代会的主任李泰铙，她，也就是现在永坚幼儿园的主任。
    创业固然很艰难，而尤其艰难的是白手创业。办一个托儿站，处处都遇到了困难：首先是没有房子，把孩子安顿在那里？李泰铙好容易在剪子巷找到了一间空房子，可是上无屋顶，下无地板，门窗不全，四面透风，简直连鸡棚都不如。要待修理吧，手头连一文开办费都没有。怎么办？李泰铙回家把自己房间里的板壁和睡觉的铺板统统拆下来，找到了居民段里一个积极分子——木匠张嘉坤，请他来尽义务修理。可是没有钉子又怎么动手？李泰铙便又动员本段上的妇女每人义务扎一双鞋底，自己连夜赶了两双，凑了二块多钱工钱。这一点钱，一半买了钉子，勉强把一间破房子整了起来，余下的就作为托儿站的“开办费”，买些糖果、纸张。其他的一切必要用具，全部都是附近居民借出来的，孩子们的小板凳、毛巾、茶杯都是自己带来的。就这样第一期收进了二十二个小朋友。
    可是，没有钱总不能长期支持下去。李泰铙看到孩子们没有糖果，便回家找了几件旧东西，瞒着大家卖掉了，买些糖果、开水送到托儿站去。她自己呢？那时因为生活困难，有时却在城脚下挖些野菜掺在粥里充饥。这事被一个孩子的家长发现了，一传开去，大家都很感动。以后，家长们便自愿拿出一角或五分钱的糖果费来。这些钱就成了托儿站的经费，维持了一年多的时间。
    到1953年，小朋友增加到六十多个。一间房子实在挤不下去了，许多家长还在要求把自己的孩子送进来。李泰铙只得又千方百计四出找房子，后来在三条营六十四号
  （现在的园址），找到了一间半。这一间半同样是破旧不堪，不蔽风雨。但毕竟多了半间。李泰铙和房主人交涉好，便和几个妇女积极分子自己动起手来，花了几天时间把它打扫干净，修补整齐，把剪子巷的孩子们搬到这里来。从这时起，托儿站才开始有几个固定的工作人员。送来的孩子每人每月缴五角钱，托儿站才算有了正常的收入。
    困难好像还只是开始，新的问题一个个接踵而来。在托儿站同一幢房子里，还住有四、五户人家。六十多个孩子搬进来，整天吵吵嚷嚷的，自然会破坏他们原来的生活秩序。托儿站一进来，差不多天天要闹事，不是你家闹水缸打翻了，就是他家闹小鸡被砸死了。教养员即使整天关紧了门，又怎么能关得住孩子们的性子？在这种情况下，或者是孩子们搬走，或者是动员邻居搬家，别的办法是没有的。李泰铙又只得四出想办法，一面找好了房子，一面说服邻居和他们对调，一直到1955年，才争取到像现在这样一整片的六间房子，孩子们才有了几间比较宽敞的活动室。
    有了房子，也有了一定的收入，当然就需要有一个会精打细算的当家人。1954年6月以前，李泰铙虽在筹办托儿站的工作上呕心沥血，尽了很大力量，但她还要负责妇代会的工作，托儿站的行政管理始终没有走上轨道。到1954年6月24日，上级正式决定李泰铙负责托儿站工作。
    当时她看到房子的墙壁被煤烟熏得黑油油的。孩子们的身上，常常挨着一块块的黑油灰。她很想找一个泥水匠来粉一粉，谁知计算了一下，连工连材料至少得花三十元。李泰铙没舍得出这笔钱，她抽了一个星期天，找到一个熟识的泥水匠，向他学会了粉墙的方法；自己去买了材料，动员园里的教养员们大家动手粉。结果，只花了三块钱，利用了一个星期日和几天业余时间，就把园里的墙壁全部粉刷得焕然一新。
    园里的孩子们一天天多起来了，整天蹲在小活动室里，怎不闷得发慌？李泰铙早就替孩子们打算到了。屋子后面有一个比较大的院子，这院子方方正正，给孩子们做一个小操场挺合适。可就是因为院子里堆了好几个垃圾堆，多少年都没有人敢动过它，而且越堆越高，简直像小山一样。李泰铙就和园里的工作人员商量，鼓动大家自己来扒。全园七个工作人员真的干起来了。她们这种精神，感动了孩子们的家长，有些家长便自愿来帮忙，果然不到两个星期，这座垃圾山居然被她们征服了。
    可是，新的操场却又带来了新的要求：要是这操场上有几件大型玩具多好！一天，李泰铙到运动器具店去打听，一问，滑梯、摇船、跷跷板、摇马，光这四件就要一百五十元。这个数字简直把李泰铙吓了一跳！后来，她自己去木行里买了木料，和附近有大车的居民商量，答允用替他们打毛衣做针线活换工的办法，请他们到木行里把材料拖到运动器具厂去定做。这样就省下了一笔运费。在定做的工价方面，她又帮助厂里精打细算，结果，这四件东西，总共只花了八十一元就做成功了。
    像这样不花钱、少花钱、自己劳动自己动手的例子，在永坚幼儿园里是举不胜举的。孩子们玩的沙，是教养员拿了口袋出去背回来，又自己设法淘洗出来的；孩子们做作业用的泥工板，是利用旧肥皂箱的木板做的；孩子们玩的娃娃、小狗、小白兔和大鼻象等玩具，也是教养员用零碎布和废料做起来的。
    由于她们的勤俭，现在，每个孩子每月虽只收七角钱，除供应孩子们糖果、点心以外，园里还陆续添置了很多必要的家具和玩具。开办时所有借来的东西都已经归还了原主。最近又添了五十张小椅子。现在还积余了六百二十五元。
    孩子们的生活是一天天丰富多采了。幼儿园的工作人员呢？从园主任到教养员、保育员，始终保持着勤俭朴素的传统作风。她们每天清晨最迟在六点半钟就到园，一直工作到下午五时半离园。每天中午和下午，不论是盛暑寒冬，不论是刮风下雨，各班老师都要负责把每个孩子送到家里吃饭、休息。有时在雷雨季节，暴雨使门口涨满了水，园主任便和老师们脱掉鞋子，把一个个年纪小的孩子背着送回家。每星期还得作一次普遍的家庭访问，征求家长的意见，了解教育的效果。园里没有勤杂工，她们就轮流负责打扫清洁，工作是够辛苦的。可是，园里的工作人员，却全是半义务性的。她们每月只拿七元到十元的生活补贴。五年来，在这个幼儿园里没有出过一次事故，也没有闹过一次传染病，有好几个孩子还受到了居民委员会的表扬。仅仅就是这一些，已经可以使我们知道这个幼儿园在保教工作上的成绩了。
