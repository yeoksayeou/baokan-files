Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd: According to a report from the Polish News Agency, the third plenary session of the Provisional Central Committee of the Polish Socialist Youth League was held in Warsaw in mid-March and concluded on the 21st. The meeting discussed the tasks, organization, and personnel matters of the League. Morawski, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, spoke at the meeting.

He said that many young people in Poland have become active, and the October Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party aroused many hopes. However, later, feelings of disappointment arose in the hearts of many young people. They hoped that the October decisions would magically eliminate all the shortcomings and difficulties in life and immediately improve the situation. This is impossible, and indeed no one can achieve this.

Morawski then pointed out that the Socialist Youth League had not carried out propaganda and explanation work for young people in the past and had not regarded this as its primary task. He said that the important thing is to carry out ideological work among young people in a form and method that they can accept, strengthen their understanding of socialist ideas, so that these ideas can stimulate their imagination and arouse their sense of responsibility. First of all, it is necessary to care about politics and mobilize young people to participate in socialist construction, improve their awareness, talent, understanding of social interests, and strengthen labor discipline. The important thing is not to recruit as many new members as possible or to pull young people into the organization, but to influence the young masses and guide the young masses.

Morawski pointed out that the Party hopes that this socialist organization of young people will become a fighting organization with rich ideological and political content, and an independent organization according to Leninist principles. Such an organization will become a real force in the struggle for socialism, a communist school, and a center for training new cadres for the Party.

The resolution passed by the plenary session stated that the task of the Socialist Youth League is to assist the Party in overcoming the difficulties and obstacles in implementing the program of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party and to participate in the struggle for comprehensive reform.

The meeting elected Lenk as the First Secretary of the Provisional Central Committee of the Socialist Youth League, and Sokolowski as the Economic Secretary of the Provisional Central Committee.

    莫拉夫斯基在波社会主义青年联盟中央全会上讲话
    强调对青年加强政治思想教育
    新华社23日讯据波兰通讯社报道：波兰社会主义青年联盟临时中央委员会第三次全体会议3月中旬在华沙举行，并且已经在21日结束。会议讨论了联盟的任务、组织和人事问题。波兰统一工人党中央委员会政治局委员莫拉夫斯基在会上讲了话。
    他说，波兰许多青年都积极地活动起来了，波兰统一工人党中央委员会十月全体会议激起了许多希望，但是，后来许多青年心中产生了失望的情绪。他们希望十月的各项决定像魔法一样地消除生活中的一切缺点和困难，使情况立即改善。这是不可能的，的确谁也不会作到这一点。
    莫拉夫斯基接着指出，社会主义青年联盟过去没有向青年进行宣传、解释工作，没有把这件事当作主要任务。他说，重要的事情是要以青年所能接受的形式和方法在他们中间展开思想工作，加强他们对社会主义思想的了解，使这些思想能够激发他们的想像力，唤起他们的责任感，首先必须关心政治，要动员青年投入社会主义建设，提高青年的觉悟、才能、对社会利益的了解和加强劳动纪律。重要的事情不是要吸收尽可能多的新盟员，或是把青年拉进组织里来，而是要影响青年群众，要指导青年群众。
    莫拉夫斯基指出，党希望青年的这个社会主义组织成为一个具有丰富的思想内容和政治内容的战斗组织，一个根据列宁主义的准则来看是独立的组织。这样一个组织将成为争取社会主义斗争中的一支真正的力量，一所共产主义学校，一个为党培养新干部的中心。
    全体会议通过的决议说，社会主义青年联盟的任务是协助党克服在执行波兰统一工人党八中全会的纲领方面的困难和障碍，参加争取全面革新的斗争。
    会议选举伦克为社会主义青年联盟临时中央委员会第一书记，索科洛夫斯基为临时中央委员会经济书记。
