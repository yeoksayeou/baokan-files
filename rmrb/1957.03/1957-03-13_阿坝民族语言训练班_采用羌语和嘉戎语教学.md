Xinhua News Agency News: The phonetic symbols for the Qiang and Jiarong languages, preliminarily designed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Minority Languages Survey Team, have been adopted by the national language training class of the Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture's National Normal School in Sichuan Province. This language training class uses experimental teaching to enrich and revise the phonetic symbols, creating conditions for the creation of Qiang and Jiarong writing systems.

In the second half of last year, the Minority Languages Survey Team of the Chinese Academy of Sciences conducted focused and in-depth investigations into the phonology, grammar, and vocabulary of the Qiang and Jiarong languages in Heishui, Li County, Ma'erkang, and other places in the prefecture. After collecting several thousand words, they initially determined forty-three Qiang language vowels and consonants and seventy-one Jiarong language vowels and consonants.

The Qiang people who speak the Qiang language and the Tibetans are distributed in Wenchuan, Li County, and Heishui in this prefecture, totaling more than 60,000 people; the Tibetans who speak the Jiarong language are distributed in the agricultural area counties of this prefecture and Danba in the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, totaling about 70,000 people.

    阿坝民族语言训练班
    采用羌语和嘉戎语教学
    新华社讯　中国科学院少数民族语言调查队初步设计的羌语和嘉戎语的拼音符号，已被四川省阿坝藏族自治州民族师范学校的民族语言训练班采用。这个语言训练班通过实验教学，来充实和修正拼音符号，为创立羌文和嘉戎文创造条件。
    中国科学院少数民族语言调查队去年下半年在这个州的黑水、理县和马尔康等地，对羌语和嘉戎语的音系、语法、词汇等，进行了重点的深入调查，搜集了几千个词汇后，初步确定了四十三个羌语和七十一个嘉戎语的元辅音。
    说羌语的羌族和藏族分布在这个州的汶川、理县和黑水，约六万多人；说嘉戎语的藏族分布在这个州的农业区各县和甘孜藏族自治州的丹巴，约七万人。
