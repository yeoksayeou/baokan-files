    China's Most Automated Hydropower Equipment
    Modekou Hydropower Station Begins Supplying Power to the Capital

    (Our newspaper dispatch) The Modekou Hydropower Station in the western suburbs of the capital, China's first remote-measuring hydropower station, officially began supplying power to the capital at 10 PM on March 3rd. This hydropower station is built outside Modekou Village in Shijingshan District, utilizing the drop in the Yongding River diversion channel to generate electricity. It is currently China's most automated hydropower station, requiring only two minutes from start-up to electricity generation. However, the project cost is low, averaging only about 800 yuan per kilowatt, and all costs can be recovered in just over a year after power generation.

    Construction of this hydropower station began on January 18, 1956. After nine months of intense construction, all hydraulic structures and electromechanical installation work were completed by the end of September of the same year. After the Yongding River diversion project released water, various projects of the hydropower station underwent flushing tests and unit trial operation. After a week, more than 20 tests were completed smoothly and safely. After assessment by relevant personnel, the project quality fully met the design standards.

    During the construction of the hydropower station, the staff launched socialist labor competitions and advanced producer movements, proposing 290+ rationalization proposals, which greatly shortened the construction period and completed the task ahead of schedule. The entire project saved a total of 200,700+ yuan, exceeding the savings target required by the higher authorities by 119.4%. Thanks to the joint efforts of all employees, the hydropower station project was completed under the principles of "good, fast, economical, and safe". Therefore, from the start of the project in early 1956 to its completion, it won the national socialist labor competition collective award from the Ministry of Electric Power Industry for three consecutive quarters.

    After the Modekou Hydropower Station generates electricity, it can generate 40 million kilowatt-hours of cheap power for the capital every year, which is also equivalent to saving the country more than 20,000 tons of coal every year. This is of great significance for accelerating the rapid development of the capital's industry and further meeting the growing demand for electricity for living. (Attached picture)

    我国目前自动化程度最高的水电设备
    模式口水电站开始向首都送电
    本报讯  我国第一座遥远测量水电站——首都西郊模式口水电站在3日下午10时正式向首都送电了。这座水电站建筑在石景山区模式口村外，是利用永定河引水河道上的落差发电的。它是我国目前自动化程度最高的水电站，从开机到发出电来只需二分钟时间。但是工程造价低廉，平均每瓩只有八百元左右，发电后一年多就可以收回全部造价。
    这个水电站是在1956年1月18日开工兴建的，经过九个月的紧张施工，全部水工建筑物和机电安装工程在同年9月底就完成。永定河引水工程放水后，水电站各项工程进行冲水试验和机组试运转。经过一星期时间，顺利安全地完成了二十多项试验，经过有关人员的鉴定，工程质量完全达到设计标准要求。
    水电站施工过程中，职工们开展了社会主义劳动竞赛和先进生产者运动，提出合理化建议二百九十多件，大大缩短了工期，提前完成了任务。整个工程共节约了二十万零七千多元，超过了上级要求的节约指标119.4％。由于全体职工共同努力，保证了水电站工程在好、快、省、安全的原则下完成了任务，因此，从1956年初工程开工到结束，连续三个季度都获得了电力工业部全国社会主义劳动竞赛集体优胜奖。
    模式口水电站发电后，每年可以为首都产生出四千万度廉价的电源，还等于每年给国家节省二万多吨煤，这对加速首都工业的迅速发展和更加满足生活用电日益增长的需要有着重要意义。（附图片）
