I agree with and support Chairman Mao's speech and the reports of Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong.

I would like to offer a small suggestion regarding the Second Five-Year Plan proposal for your reference.

What is this small suggestion?

I believe that the Second Five-Year Plan proposal should emphasize the planned and systematic strengthening of tea production in tea-producing areas to enrich the country and benefit the people.

Our country's tea has a history of over two thousand years and has long been famous throughout the world. Many countries like to use Chinese tea to express their hospitality when entertaining distinguished guests. Therefore, the highest annual export volume of Chinese tea in the 19th century reached as much as 2.6 million dan.

The Uses of Tea

Why do people in various countries around the world like to drink tea? What are the benefits of drinking tea?

From a physiological and hygienic point of view, tea can break down fats, aid digestion, stimulate nerves, restore energy, precipitate decay, and soften blood vessels. From a pharmacological and therapeutic perspective, it can promote diuresis and strengthen the heart, contain tannins and promote astringency, relieve hangovers and alleviate pain, prolong life and strengthen vitality; it can also cure dysentery, fistulas, anemia, diabetes, scurvy, and is a preventative for tuberculosis, a good medicine for aviators, and can also save food.

Tea has so many benefits for life that people everywhere, regardless of age, gender, or nationality, all like to drink it. Especially in our country's ethnic minority areas, it is considered as important as grain and is indispensable. In Inner Mongolia, there is a saying: "You can't get on a horse or work in the fields without tea," and even "You can't defecate without tea." Tea is so important to life that it can sell well in countries around the world.

Later, due to imperialist aggression and the cruel oppression and exploitation of tea farmers by the feudal ruling class and bureaucratic bourgeoisie, tea gardens were abandoned and production sharply declined. Most of the foreign markets were replaced by Japan and other countries. Since liberation, with the advocacy and encouragement of the Communist Party of China and the People's Government, the national tea production has gradually increased year by year. If we take 1949 as 100%, then 1952 was 200.7% and 1956 was 292.7%; nearly tripling in seven years, which can be said to be a very rapid increase. This is a demonstration of the superiority of our socialist system. However, this increased figure is still far from the highest annual output in our country's history and cannot meet the needs of the vast people whose lives have improved. When I inspected Inner Mongolia last summer, people reported that the supply of tea was somewhat tight and inconvenient. This shows that our country's current tea production is not only insufficient to meet the needs of the domestic people, but also insufficient to meet international demands. Let's look at the export sales figures for the past few years! If we take 1949 as 100%, then 1952 was 273.2%, 1955 was 262%, and 1956 was 389.4%; almost tripling in seven years, which cannot be said to be a slow increase. The year-by-year increase in export volume also shows that our country's friendly relations and economic ties with other countries are developing and strengthening. However, this figure still cannot meet the needs of Europe, America, North Africa, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, the Soviet Union, and the New Democratic countries. Therefore, increasing tea production is very necessary at present.

Increasing Tea Production Will Not Compete with Grain and Cotton for Land

Will increasing tea production compete with grain and cotton for land?

I don't think so.

Because tea is suitable for production in hilly areas and mountains, and its altitude must be between 250 meters and 800 meters, and the higher the altitude, the better. It is even better if it is in the clouds and mist all year round. Haven't we heard the praise for Mengshan tea: "The water in the Yangtze River, the tea on the top of Mengshan"? The reason why the tea on the top of Mengshan is so good is that it is in the clouds and mist all year round. We also know that the Junshan tea from Dongting Lake in Hunan, the Wuyi tea from Fujian, and other famous teas are also famous for the same reason. Here, let me briefly explain why tea with high mountains and lots of fog has better quality. This is because the tea leaves are less exposed to the ultraviolet rays of the sun during growth, and the important components it contains, such as tea polyphenols, tannins, vitamin C, and aromatic oils, are relatively rich. Naturally, there are other natural conditions such as rainfall, temperature, and soil, as well as different management practices such as fertilization, cultivation, weeding, and pest control. This means that tea is suitable for planting in high places. And grain? It is suitable for low-lying areas with sufficient sunlight. From this, we can see that the place suitable for growing tea is not necessarily suitable for growing grain, and the place suitable for growing grain is not suitable for growing tea. In this way, it is natural to say that there will be no contradiction between growing tea and competing with grain and cotton for land.

Three Major Benefits of Increasing Tea Production

What are the benefits of growing tea?

The benefits of growing tea:

First, the income from growing tea is higher than that from growing grain.

Tea-growing areas mostly can only grow miscellaneous grains such as corn, sweet potatoes, and beans, and are not suitable for growing millet (rice), as we all know. For the sake of explanation, let's compare it with millet! At present, the general yield of millet is 500 jin per mu at the low end, with a price of 4 fen per jin, resulting in an income of 20 yuan. At the high end, it is 800 jin to 1,000 jin, resulting in an income of 32 yuan to 40 yuan. And what about growing tea? Taking the lowest yield of 150 jin per mu as an example, with a price of 3 jiao per jin, the income is 45 yuan, and the highest yield is 340 jin, resulting in an income of 102 yuan. (The Hangzhou October Tea Cooperative produced 143 jin per mu in 1955, with the highest yield being 346 jin. The Qimen Tea Experiment Station in Anhui produced 306 jin per mu. The Pingzhou Tea Cooperative in Anxi County, Fujian, produced 112 jin to 320 jin per mu. The Qunfeng Tea Cooperative in Xiangtan, Hunan, produced 116 to 214 jin per mu.) In comparison, the income from growing tea is indeed one or two times higher than that from growing millet. If we compare it with corn or sweet potatoes, the difference is even greater. From this, we can see that the income from growing tea is higher than that from growing grain, which is very clear. Since the income from growing tea is higher than that from growing grain, we should vigorously promote the cultivation of tea in areas suitable for growing tea to increase farmers' income, which is also in line with our country's guiding ideology of developing a diversified economy.

Second, it expands exports, earns foreign exchange, increases national accumulation, and accelerates industrialization.

In the six years since the liberation of Zhejiang Province, the tea exported by the state-run companies alone can be exchanged for 398,675 tons of steel rails, which can lay more than 4,600 kilometers of railway. There are more than 600 counties in 15 provinces in our country that produce tea. If the output of each province is the same as that of Zhejiang (naturally, the tea output of some provinces and regions may not be able to catch up with Zhejiang now, but there are also many provinces and regions such as Sichuan, Yunnan, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Fujian, which can catch up or exceed Zhejiang, if they are vigorously developed, they can all catch up.), the steel rails exchanged can lay more than 69,000 kilometers of railway. This figure will exceed the 7 times of the 8,000 to 9,000 kilometers of new railway planned in our current Second Five-Year Plan. From this, we can see that increasing tea production, expanding exports, and is very capable of accelerating our country's industrialization.

Third, it enhances friendly relations and peaceful unity among countries.

Our country has mutual economic exchanges and assistance with socialist fraternal countries and independent national countries. They help us with industrial machinery, and we supply them with their favorite tea. We exchange what we have for what we lack, which benefits both parties. This is the best way to consolidate friendship and strengthen unity.

Although the rulers of capitalist countries have built high barriers in an attempt to prevent the exchange of people between the two sides, tea is the most favorite beverage of their people. If we can supply them with tea, no matter how high the barriers are, they cannot stop this envoy of friendship. In this way, we can achieve the goal of friendly exchanges among the people of all countries, and even unity, friendship, and maintenance of peace.

From this, it seems very clear that increasing tea production has great benefits for the people, for the country, and for world peace. Since increasing tea production has so many and such great benefits, I suggest that the Second Five-Year Plan should have a planned and systematic expansion of tea production to benefit the country and the people.

Will developing tea production hinder industrialization?

The investment in developing tea production does not need to be very large. As long as we attach importance to the guiding ideology of developing diversified operations, correct the phenomenon of valuing grain over tea, rationally stipulate the purchase price of tea, make appropriate investments in cooperatives or state-owned tea farms, and cultivate tea talents, it can be done. Not only will it not hinder industrialization, but it will promote industrialization.

Tea is a perennial plant. It takes five or six years from sowing to start picking tea, which means that cultivation starting from the Second Five-Year Plan will not be harvested until the Third Five-Year Plan. At that time, our people's lives will definitely be better, and the need for tea will definitely be greater, and our international trade and economic exchanges will definitely be more frequent. And we now have many barren mountains and wastelands waiting to be developed and operated to increase production, so we should start planning to develop production and expand tea areas at this time in order to adapt to the needs of the domestic people and international friends, otherwise, we will lag behind objective requirements.

Please correct me if there is anything inappropriate in this small suggestion.

Finally, I wish the conference success and the comrades good health!

    发展茶叶生产　可以裕国福民
    张志和就第二个五年计划建议里茶叶生产一项提出意见
    我对于毛主席的讲话，周恩来主席、李富春副总理、陈叔通副主席的报告，均表示同意和拥护。
    我现在就第二个五年计划的建议提供一点小小的意见，以备参考。
    什么小意见呢？
    我觉得第二个五年计划的建议里应该着重有计划、有步骤地在产茶区域加强发展茶叶生产，以裕国福民。
    我国茶叶，已有两千多年的历史，早已驰名世界，很多国家里的人招待佳宾，多喜用中国茶叶来表达热情。因此，我国的茶叶在十九世纪时最高年度的出口数量就已达到了二百六十万担之多。
    茶叶的功用
    世界各国的人喜欢喝茶，究竟喝茶有什么好处呢？
    茶，从生理卫生方面讲，它能够分解脂肪、帮助消化、兴奋神经、恢复疲劳、沉淀化腐、柔软血管。从药理治疗方面讲，它能利尿强心、含?收敛，醒酒止痛、延命强精；并能治愈：痢疾、瘘疮、贫血、糖尿病、坏血病，而且是结核病的预防剂，飞行者的良药，还可以节约食米。
    茶，对于人生有这么多的好处，所以地不问中外，年不论老少，家家户户，男男女女，无不喜欢喝它。特别是在我国少数民族地区把它当成同粮食一样重要不可一天或缺。内蒙古有“没茶喝，不能上马，不能下地”的说法，甚至有“没茶喝，拉不出屎来”的事情。茶叶对人生有这样的重要，所以它能畅销于世界各国。
    后来，因为帝国主义的侵略，封建统治阶级和官僚资产阶级对于茶农的残酷压迫剥削，以致茶园荒芜，生产锐减，所有国外市场，大半为日本和其他国家的所代替。解放以来，经中国共产党和人民政府的提倡奖励，全国茶叶产量逐年有所提高，如以1949年为100％，那末，1952年是200.7％。1956年为292.7％；七年间将近增产到三倍，这可以说是增产很快了。这是我们社会主义制度优越的说明。但是这个增产了的数字，距离我国历史上最高年产量还远，还不能满足生活改善了的广大人民的需要。去年夏天我去内蒙古视察时，人民就反映茶叶供给有些紧张，感觉不便。这说明我国现在的茶叶产量，不但不够供应国内人民的需要，也不够满足国际间的要求。我们看这几年的出口外销数量吧！如以1949年为100％，那末1952年是273.2％，1955年为262％，1956年为389.4％；七年之间几乎增加了三倍，这不能说增加的不快了，外销数量的逐年增加，也可说明我国同各国的亲善友好、经济关系是日益发展和加强的。但是，这个数字还是不能满足欧、美、北非、中亚、南洋、苏联、新民主主义各国的需要。因此，增产茶叶在目前是很有必要的。
    增产茶叶不会同粮棉争地
    增产茶叶是否会同粮棉争地呢？
    我以为是不会的。
    因为茶叶适于生产在丘陵地区和山地，其高度要在二百五十米到八百米之间才行，而且是高度愈高愈好。如能高到终年在云雾中更好。我们不是听说过赞美蒙山茶好的一句话是：“扬子江中水，蒙山顶上茶”吗？蒙山顶上茶所以好，就是它终年在云雾中的缘故。我们又知道湖南洞庭湖的君山茶、福建的武夷茶和其他的名茶所以四远驰名，也是由于同样的理由。这里附带说一说为什么山高雾多的茶叶品质就好呢？这是因为茶叶在生长中少受太阳光线的紫外线的照射，它所含的重要成分如茶素、丹宁、维生素C、芳香油之类就比较丰富的缘故。自然，还有其他雨量、温度、土壤等天然条件和施肥、中耕、除草、驱虫等经营管理不同的关系。这就是说，茶适宜于种在高的地方。而粮食呢？则适宜于日光照射充足的低地。由此可知，适于种茶的地方，不一定适于种粮，而适于种粮的地方是不适于种茶的。这样，自然就说不上种茶会有同粮棉争地的矛盾了。
    增产茶叶的三大好处
    种茶，有什么好处呢？
    种茶的好处：
    第一是种茶的收入比种粮食的多。
    种茶的地区，大都只能种玉米（包谷）、白薯（红苕）豆类等杂粮而不适于种黄谷（大米），这是我们都知道的。为便于说明，姑以黄谷来比较吧！现在一般黄谷的产量，低的以亩产五百斤计，每斤价四分，收入二十元。高的八百斤到一千斤，收入三十二元到四十元。而种茶呢？以最低亩产一百五十斤计，每斤价三角，收入四十五元，最高产三百四十斤，收入一百零二元。（杭州十月茶合社1955年亩产一百四十三斤，最高产三百四十六斤。安徽祁门茶叶试验站亩产三百零六斤。福建安溪县萍州茶合社亩产一百一十二斤到三百二十斤。湖南湘潭群峰茶合社亩产一百一十六到二百一十四斤。）两相比较，种茶的收入，实在比种黄谷的要多一、两倍。如以玉米或白薯来比，相差更多。由此可知，种茶比种粮的收入要多些，是很明白的了。既是种茶比种粮的收入多，所以我们宜在适于种茶的地区大力提倡种茶，以增加农民的收入，这也是符合我们国家发展多种经济的指导思想的。
    第二是扩大外销、换取外汇，增加国家积累，加速工业化。
    浙江省解放后六年来，只是国家经营出口的茶叶，就可换回钢轨三十九万八千六百七十五吨，这些钢轨，可以铺铁路四千六百余公里。我国产茶的地方，有十五个省计六百余县之多，假如每个省的产量都像浙江一样（自然，现在有些省区的茶叶产量是不一定赶得上浙江的，但也有好些省区如四川、云南、湖南、湖北、江西、安徽、福建等，是可以赶上或超过浙江的，如均大力发展，都是可以赶上的。）换回的钢轨，就可以铺铁路六万九千多公里，这个数字，将超过我们现在所拟的第二个五年计划预定新修铁路八到九千公里的七倍还多。由此，可知增加茶叶生产、扩大外销，是很可以加速我国工业化的。
    第三是增强各国友好亲善、和平团结。
    我国，同社会主义阵营各兄弟国家和民族独立各国都是有相互经济往还援助的，它们以工业品的机器来帮助我们，我们以他们最喜爱的茶叶去供给他们，彼此以有易无，双方皆利，这是巩固友谊、加强团结的最好办法。
    资本主义国家的统治者，尽管高筑障壁，企图阻止双方人民的往来，但茶叶是它们的人民最喜爱的，我们如能以茶叶供给它们，障壁虽高，是不能阻挡这一亲善使节的。这样，就可以达到各国人民亲善往来以至团结友好、维护和平的目的。
    由此看来，增产茶叶，对于人民，对于国家，对于世界和平都有很大好处，是很明白了。增产茶叶，既有这么大、这么多的好处，所以我建议在第二个五年计划里应有计划有步骤地扩大茶叶生产，以利国福民。
    发展茶叶生产，是否会妨碍工业化呢？
    发展茶叶的投资，为数并不要好大，只要我们重视发展多种经营的指导思想，纠正重粮轻茶的现象，合理规定茶叶收购价格，酌量向合作社或国营茶场投资，并培植茶叶人才，就可能办到，不但不会妨碍工业化而且会促进工业化。
    茶叶是多年生植物，从播种起，要五、六年以后才能开始采茶，就是说从第二个五年计划开始培植，也要到第三个五年计划才有收获。那个时候，我们人民生活一定会更加美好，需要茶叶，一定更多，我们的国际贸易经济交流，一定更加频繁。而我们现在又还有很多荒山荒地正待开发经营、增加生产，所以此时即应着手计划发展生产、扩大茶区，才能适应国内人民、国际友邦的需要，不然，就会落后于客观要求。
    这一小小意见，不当之处，请大家指正。
    最后，祝大会成功，同志们健康！
