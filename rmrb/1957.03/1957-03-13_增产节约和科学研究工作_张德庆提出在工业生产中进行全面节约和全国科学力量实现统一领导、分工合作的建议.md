Increase Production and Practice Economy, and Scientific Research Work
    Zhang Deqing proposes comprehensive conservation in industrial production and unified leadership and division of labor and cooperation of national scientific forces

    I would like to express my humble opinions on the leadership, division of labor, and cooperation of increased production and economy and scientific research work. Please criticize and correct me if there is anything inappropriate. Increasing production and practicing economy is an important factor in my country's current socialist construction. At present, the conservation work in my country's industrial production is not systematic enough, not comprehensive enough, and not in-depth enough. The possibilities for conservation in industrial production have not been comprehensively examined from the aspects of stress distribution of components, material selection, process design, and waste recycling. My country still lacks strategic materials such as nickel, chromium, and titanium, but these materials are still being consumed in civilian products. The manganese-molybdenum quenched and tempered steel researched by the Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics of the Academy of Sciences can largely replace medium-carbon chromium steel, and the carburized boron steel researched by this institute can largely replace chromium-manganese-titanium carburized steel. However, these steels have not been fully tested and promoted. Waste cotton from yarn mills can be mixed with plastics to manufacture substitutes for cold-rolled steel plates. The Austrian automobile factory in East Germany has been formally using this plastic to manufacture car bodies in the production of cars, but in my country's machine industry, this material is still in the initial stage of research. Due to the fact that the development of the metallurgical industry has not kept up with the development of the machine industry, the machine industry feels a lack of raw materials, but the situation of uneconomical use of materials still exists. To improve this situation, it is best to establish increase production and economy committees in various industrial departments, organize expert groups, and urge the relevant professional divisions, departments, sections, institutes, or offices of the department to carry out the following tasks:
    (1) Review the structural design of various products in the department, and through experiments and calculations, seek the full utilization of materials.
    (2) Change to using materials that my country has already produced or can produce to replace imported materials.
    (3) Use my country's abundant materials to create various materials with properties similar to imported materials.
    (4) Combine the use of domestic materials and make necessary modifications to product structure design and process design.
    (5) After adopting new materials, new designs, and new processes, conduct test bench tests and application tests of new products, so as to test the safety and durability of the new products after changing the design and materials in practice before production. The increase production and economy committee should supervise and inspect the above tasks, summarize experience, and submit successful increase production and economy methods to the leadership for implementation, and report them to the National Technology Commission for review and promotion. By doing so, in the industrial sector, generally speaking, more comprehensive conservation can be achieved, while also playing a role in increasing production.
    The above work requires the cooperation of research departments. Therefore, it is hoped that research institutions will pay attention to research topics related to conservation and the creation of new domestic materials when selecting research topics.
    Regarding the leadership of scientific research work, I think we can make use of existing institutions and manpower. If the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Higher Education, and the National Technology Commission unite, on the basis of the Department of Technical Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the academic committees of the various research institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the outstanding scientists of the country can be organized into professional groups by region according to their specialties. These groups can lead scientific research throughout the country, such as discussing the selection, coordination, research methods, and research reports of topics. Scientific research institutions of the Academy of Sciences, industrial departments, and universities can carry out division of labor and cooperation according to their tasks and characteristics. The Academy of Sciences should mainly study basic scientific theories and scientific issues of great significance to the national economy. The scientific research institutions affiliated to the ministries and bureaus of the industrial departments should mainly study the development, improvement, and creation of new products. The research departments of factories should mainly solve technical problems in production. The characteristic of universities is that they can regard part of the scientific research work as graduation theses for students to undertake. At present, graduation theses have not yet generally started in engineering colleges. What has already started is graduation design, which is assisted and guided by outside the school. In the future, after adopting the graduation thesis system combined with research work, teachers in universities will have to guide the graduation thesis research work of more than five students each, which will inevitably be very busy. It will be difficult to spare a lot of time to carry out a lot of research on their own in the first few years of starting graduation theses. Therefore, industrial departments can request universities to conduct research that can be completed in two to three months as graduation theses. Research on the development of basic scientific theories and important but not very urgent research topics that require a long time to study can be undertaken by teachers. Graduation theses can also be conducted in the research institutes of industrial departments under the guidance of engineers from industrial departments. Such cooperation can ensure that the problems waiting to be solved in the industrial departments are studied, and the students' graduation theses can be combined with practice. Extremely important issues for the industrial departments, such as the establishment of domestic alloy steel, can be undertaken by the Academy of Sciences, but the research results, such as the research and testing of the process performance and use performance of these new steel grades, should be borne by the industrial departments. Between the Academy of Sciences and universities, researchers from the Academy of Sciences can concurrently serve as professors in universities, and professors from universities can also concurrently serve as researchers in the Academy of Sciences. I think the above can be used as the basis for the division of labor and cooperation between the Academy of Sciences, industrial departments, and engineering colleges. Please criticize and correct me if there is anything inappropriate.

    增产节约和科学研究工作
    张德庆提出在工业生产中进行全面节约和全国科学力量实现统一领导、分工合作的建议
    我现在就增产节约和科学研究工作的领导与分工合作两个问题表示管见，不妥当的地方请各位批评指正。增产节约是我国目前社会主义建设中的一个重要因素。目前我国工业生产方面的节约做得还不够有系统，不够全面，不够深入。工业生产中的节约可能性还没有从机件的应力分布，材料选择，工艺设计和废料回收等方面进行全面检查。我国目前还缺少镍、铬、钛等战略物资，但民用产品中还在消耗这些物资。科学院冶金陶瓷研究所已经研究出来的锰钼调质钢大体上可以代替中炭铬钢，这个所研究出来的渗炭硼钢大体上可以代替铬锰钛渗炭钢。但是这些钢还没有得到充分的试用和推广。用纱厂的废棉花混合塑胶可以制造冷轧钢板代用品，民主德国奥地汽车厂在生产小汽车中已正规运用这种塑胶制造车身，但在我国机器工业中这种材料尚在开始研究。由于冶金工业的发展跟不上机器工业的发展，以致机器工业中感到原料缺乏，但用料不经济的情况仍然存在。要改善这种情况，最好在各工业部门中成立增产节约委员会，组织专家小组，督促本部门的有关专业司、处、科、院、所或室进行下列工作：
    （1）审核本部门各种产品的结构设计，通过试验、计算，求得材料的充分利用。
    （2）改用我国已经生产或可以生产的材料，代替进口的材料。
    （3）用我国富裕物资，创造各种和进口材料性能相近的材料。
    （4）结合采用国产材料，进行产品结构设计和工艺设计的必要修改。
    （5）等到采用新材料、新设计和新工艺后，进行新产品的试验台试验和应用试验，俾得于生产前在实践中考验更改设计和材料后新产品的安全性和耐用性。增产节约委员会要督促检查以上各项工作，总结经验，把成功的增产节约方法，提请领导上执行，并转报国家技术委员会请予审核后推广提高。这样做，在工业部门中，大体说来，可以做到比较全面的节约，同时起着增产的作用。
    进行以上工作，需要研究部门的合作，因此希望研究机构在选择研究课题时，重视有关节约和创造国产新材料的研究课题。
    科学研究工作的领导，我想可以利用现有的机构和人力。倘若中国科学院、高教部和国家技术委员会联合起来，在中国科学院技术科学部和中国科学院各研究所的学术委员会的基础上，把全国优秀的科学家，按照专业，分区组织成专业小组，这些小组就可以在全国各地领导科学研究，如讨论课题的选择、协调、研究方法及研究报告。科学院、产业部门和高等学校的科学研究机构之间，可以按照他们的任务和特点，进行分工和合作。科学院主要的应该研究基本的科学理论和对于国民经济具有重要意义的科学问题。产业部门的部属和局属科学研究机构，主要的应该研究产品的发展、改进和新产品的创造。工厂的研究部门主要的应该解决生产中的技术问题。高等学校的特点是可以把一部分科学研究工作，当作毕业论文，让学生承担。目前在工学院中一般还没有开始毕业论文。已经开始的是毕业设计，由校外协助指导的。将来采用结合研究工作的毕业论文制度后，高等学校的教师要一个人指导好五个以上学生的毕业论文研究工作，势必已经十分忙碌，在开始毕业论文的几年内很难抽出许多时间，自己进行大量的研究。因此，二个月至三个月内可以完成的研究工作，产业部门可以提请高等学校作为毕业论文研究。发展基础科学理论的研究工作以及需要长时间研究的、重要的、但是不甚迫切的研究题目，可以由教师承担。毕业论文也可以到产业部门的研究所去，在产业部门工程师的指导下进行。这样的合作可使产业部门等待解决的问题得到研究，而学生的毕业论文能够结合实际。对产业部门极为重要的问题，如国产合金钢的建立，可由科学院承担，但研究成果，如这些新钢种的工艺性能和使用性能的研究试验，则应由产业部门负担。在科学院与高等学校之间，科学院的研究员可以兼任高等学校的教授，高等学校的教授也可以兼任科学院的研究员。以上所述我想可以作为科学院、产业部门以及工学院之间分工合作的基础。不当之处请各位批评指正。
