　　Syrian Foreign Minister Criticizes Western Anti-Communist Clichés
Xinhua News Agency report: The Lebanese public is criticizing the government for accepting the Eisenhower Doctrine. The Lebanese National Congress Party issued a statement saying that the foreign policy currently implemented by Lebanon violates the Bandung Conference declaration and the Arab League charter and poses a serious threat to national independence.
According to "Politics News," the Lebanese Youth League issued a condemnation communique. The statement said that the Lebanese government's actions seriously threaten the country's independence and abandon the policy of neutrality. The Lebanese Youth League believes that this communique is an open call to turn Lebanon into an American military base.
"Telegraph" published a statement by Lebanese politician Adnan Hakim, who condemned the pro-American policy pursued by the Lebanese authorities. While criticizing the Lebanese-American joint communique, Hakim emphasized that the content of this communique is in conflict with the Arab League Security Treaty and the Bandung Conference resolutions.
Lebanese newspapers reported that opposition leaders are preparing to submit a memorandum to the Lebanese President. In this memorandum, the opposition leaders criticized the Lebanese-American joint communique issued after the talks between U.S. President Special Envoy Richards and the Lebanese government. The opposition leaders pointed out that the only correct policy that Lebanon should adopt is a policy of active neutrality and close cooperation with all Arab countries.
Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, March 23rd, TASS: Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar, when talking to reporters about the Western propaganda cliché concerning the so-called "communist threat" facing Arab countries, said that this threat does not exist. Bitar said that "the threat from imperialism and Israel is the real danger that makes us feel threatened."

    据“政治报”报道，黎巴嫩青年同盟发表谴责公报。声明说，黎巴嫩政府的行动严重地威胁了国家的独立，放弃了中立政策。黎巴嫩青年同盟认为，这个公报是一个要把黎巴嫩变成美国军事基地的公开号召。
