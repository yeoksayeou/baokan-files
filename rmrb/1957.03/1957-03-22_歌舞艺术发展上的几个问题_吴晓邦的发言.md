Several Issues in the Development of Song and Dance Art
Wu Xiaobang's Speech
　　Song and dance troupes should be enterprise-oriented; develop folk song and dance art; attach importance to the sorting and preservation of ancient music and dance.
    I very much support the twelve instructions put forward by Chairman Mao at the Supreme State Conference. Among them, the principle of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend; long-term coexistence, mutual supervision" deeply impresses me as the cornerstone of our nation today. It is the fundamental policy for the revival and prosperity of all walks of life among the Chinese people. It also guarantees freedom of creation and research for experts in all walks of life.
    All human creation and research require freedom, but freedom is never obtained out of thin air. Freedom is earned by constantly reaching out to society and nature.
    Yes, "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend; long-term coexistence, mutual supervision" will be our guiding star in overcoming difficulties and moving towards a prosperous and happy life in the future. And people's true freedom can only be earned through difficulties.
    As a literary and art worker, I would like to offer the following opinions based on my superficial understanding.
    1. There are already more than eighty national song and dance ensembles in the country (including central, local, industrial, and military systems). This kind of song and dance troupe is a new type of artistic organization in China's performing arts. Its audience is very wide (including international people, all ethnic groups, all classes, and all industries in China).
    In my personal view, this new form of song and dance art has a mass base in China at present, so it can be considered to take the road of enterprise management. For example, many old troupes have a history of six or seven years since their establishment. They have a lot of resources (assets and programs) and many members. The largest troupe has reached two to three hundred people, and even the smallest has eighty people. For these older troupes, the Chinese cultural authorities should resolutely implement enterprise management methods. Let them streamline their organizations, go deep among the masses, and conduct more performances for the people, gradually improving the quality of the programs through performances. At present, older song and dance troupes across the country rely on state funding, resulting in considerable waste of manpower and money in artistic practice, and lack of originality and unique style in artistic creation. I think this is related to the bureaucratization and supply system of the performing troupes. This system must be gradually abolished in the future.
    2. We must vigorously open up a broad field for the amateur song and dance art of the Chinese masses. In the past, some literary and art comrades and gentlemen believed that China had no dance, so they proposed that we must first borrow European music and dance to build a new Chinese dance. This theory no longer exists. However, the staff of China's professional song and dance troupes still do not pay enough attention to and promote folk song and dance. Assistance and respect for folk artists still remain at the level of simple utilization, or standing in for and monopolizing. In this way, it is difficult to preserve the characteristics and features of folk songs and dances in various places; on the contrary, their characteristics and features are destroyed.
    To vigorously develop the amateur song and dance art of the Chinese people, the most important aspect is to respect and cherish the current folk artists. At the same time, we must arrange their artistic activities and let them train their own apprentices and compete with each other. In the past, China's apprenticeship system was an effective way to inherit and develop art. Today, during the transition period, not only do we need an apprenticeship system in mass amateur art, but all walks of life need to appropriately consider its advantages in socialist transformation, so as to promote the old and bring forth the new to meet the needs of the vast number of Chinese people in employment and learning. At present, it is impossible for schools specifically established for all walks of life to have everything. Some special skills and stylized art cannot be taught in schools.
    Today, we must not only rely on European school art forms, or solve the direction of amateur mass song and dance art by opening one or two training courses. At the same time, we cannot use European dance standards to measure the various song and dance arts loved by the vast number of Chinese people.
    3. We must attach importance to the preservation of ancient music and dance and folk song and dance art with historical value. In the past, Chinese musicians and dancers paid little attention to this. Elderly artists are gradually disappearing with increasing age. The Party Central Committee and the government have repeatedly sounded the alarm, asking us to value national heritage. However, almost most of the teachers and students in music schools and dance schools are indifferent to China's ancient music and dance. Although the alarm is ringing, no one pays much attention.
    In my personal opinion, there should be concrete measures in the future to attach importance to the sorting and preservation of China's ancient music and dance in order to meet the cultural needs of the vast number of people. First of all, there must be a trial-playing and trial-performing organization for the study of ancient Chinese music and dance, including talents in singing, music, and dance. These talents do not necessarily have to be selected from people engaged in European music and dance. We can recruit many people who are enthusiastic about ancient music and dance to conduct small-scale research work and conduct regular trial-playing and trial-performing. I think this approach will be more effective than a piece of paper.
    The above four immature opinions are issues in the development of China's song and dance art. Now I put them forward for everyone's criticism and correction. (Attached picture)

### 歌舞艺术发展上的几个问题　吴晓邦的发言

　　歌舞艺术发展上的几个问题
　　吴晓邦的发言
　　歌舞团应该企业化；发展民间歌舞艺术；重视古代乐舞的整理和保存工作。
    我非常拥护毛主席在最高国务会议上提出的十二条指示。其中关于“百花齐放，百家争鸣；长期共存，互相监督”一条，我深深感到这是我们今天立国的方针。它是我国人民中各行各业复兴和繁荣的基本政策。它也保障了各行各业上专家们有创造的自由和研究的自由。
    一切人类的创造和研究都需要有自由，但是自由决不凭空会得到的，自由是靠我们向社会和自然伸出手来不断去争取的。
    是的，“百花齐放，百家争鸣；长期共存，互相监督”将是我们今后冲破困难，走向繁荣、幸福生活的指路标。而人们真正的自由，也只有从困难中去争取得来的。
    我作为一个文艺工作者，就根据我粗浅的理解，提出下面几点意见来。
    一、全国国家歌舞团体，已经有八十多个（包括中央、地方、产业和部队系统的）。这种歌舞团是我国表演艺术中新兴的一种艺术形式的团体，它的观众面很广（包括国际人士、国内各民族、各阶层、各行业的人民）。
    我个人的看法，这种新兴歌舞艺术形式在目前我国已有群众的基础，因而可以考虑走企业化的道路。比如有许多老团体，从成立到现在已有六、七年的历史，它们的家底（财产及节目）很多，团员也很多。其中最庞大的团体已经达到了二、三百人，就是最小的也有八十人。对于这些老团体，我国文化当局应该坚决执行企业化的办法。让他们精简机构，深入群众，为人民进行更多的演出，从演出中逐渐提高节目的质量。现在全国较老的歌舞团体，由于依赖国家的经费，在艺术实践中人力和经济上的铺张浪费相当大，在艺术创造上没有独创性和特有风格。我想这和演出团体的机关化和供给制度是有关的。今后必须逐渐取消这种制度。
    二、要大力的为我国群众业余歌舞艺术开辟广阔的园地。过去有些文艺界的同志们和先生们认为中国没有舞蹈，因而提出了必须首先借欧洲的音乐和舞蹈去建设新中国的舞蹈。现在这种理论已经不存在了。可是我国的专业歌舞团人员，对于民间歌舞的重视和提倡还很不够。对民间艺人的帮助和尊重，还流于单纯的利用，或站在代替和包办的情况下。这样，对各地民间歌舞的特色和特点是很难保存，相反破坏了它们的特色和特点。
    我们要大力发展中国人民中业余的歌舞艺术，最重要的方面是尊敬和爱护目前的民间艺人。同时要安排他们的艺术活动，让他们去培养自己的徒弟，互相竞赛。我国过去师徒制度在艺术的继承和发挥上是行之有效的办法。今天在过渡时期内，不仅在群众业余艺术上需要有师徒制，就是各行各业都需要在社会主义改造中适当的考虑它的优点，从而推陈出新，以符合目前中国广大人民就业和学习上的需要。现在专门为各行各业设立的学校还不可能样样都有，有些特殊性的技术和风格化的艺术，又非学校可以传授。
    今天我们决不能仅仅依靠欧洲学派的艺术形式，开一、二个训练班就可以解决业余群众歌舞艺术方向的。同时也不能用欧洲舞蹈的标准来衡量中国广大人民喜爱的各种歌舞艺术。
    三、对古代乐舞和民间流传有历史价值的歌舞艺术要重视其保存工作。过去我国的音乐家和舞蹈家，对于这方面注意得很少。老年艺人随着年龄的增加逐渐在消失。党中央及政府在这方面，已经敲过几次警钟，要我们重视民族遗产。可是在音乐学校和舞蹈学校的师生们，几乎大部分人，对我国古代乐舞处于不闻不问的状态中。虽然警钟敲着，可是谁都不太注意。
    我个人的意见，今后应该有一个具体措施，来重视我国古代乐舞的整理和保存工作，以符合广大人民在文化上的要求。首先要有一个研究中国古代乐舞的试奏和试演性的组织，包括歌、乐、舞几方面的人才。这些人才也不必一定要从事欧洲音乐和舞蹈的人中来选择，可以网罗现在许多热心于古乐古舞的人，去进行一种小规模的研究工作，定期试奏试演。我想这样做法比一纸命令要收效大些。
    以上四种不成熟的意见，是我国歌舞艺术发展上的问题，现在我提出来请大家批评指正。（附图片）
