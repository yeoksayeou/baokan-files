Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, March 27th. The people of Kerala, India, held a grand mass rally in Ernakulam yesterday to warmly welcome Namboodiripad and other Communist Party members elected in the recent general election. The procession of workers, farmers, and citizens welcoming the Communist Party members on the streets of Ernakulam stretched for three miles.

Indian Communist Party General Secretary Ghosh, speaking at the mass rally, said that the Communist Party would try to cooperate with everyone in Kerala—including capitalists. "We want to ensure fair treatment for workers, but we will also protect the legitimate interests of capitalists."

Ghosh not only called on those who voted for the Indian Communist Party to cooperate with the party but also called on those who voted against the Indian Communist Party to cooperate with it.

He welcomed constructive criticism from all parties opposed to the Indian Communist Party.

Namboodiripad, a member of the Politburo of the Indian Communist Party who was elected leader of the Communist Party parliamentary group in the state assembly, said at a press conference on the same day that the main problems facing the new Kerala government were eliminating corruption and raising the living standards of farmers, the working class, and other low-income people. He said that the Communist Party state leaders who are preparing to organize the state government will maintain a frugal lifestyle, so that the people will recognize that a new order of things has emerged. The Communist Party-led government will pursue policies that protect workers and will not discriminate against workers belonging to different trade unions. He also said that the Communist Party-led government will not interfere in the religious or social activities of any sect.

　　喀拉拉邦人民欢迎印共执政
　　高士宣布将同一切人合作
    新华社新德里27日电　印度喀拉拉邦的埃纳库拉姆昨天举行盛大群众集会，热烈欢迎南布迪里巴德等在这次大选中当选的共产党议员。在埃纳库拉姆街上欢迎共产党议员的工人、农民和市民队伍，长达三英里。
    印度共产党总书记高士在群众集会上发表演说时说，共产党将在喀拉拉邦设法同一切人——包括资本家在内——进行合作。“我们要使工人得到公正的待遇，不过我们也会使资本家的合法利益得到保护”。
    高士不仅呼吁投印度共产党票的人们同共产党合作，并且还呼吁那些投票反对印度共产党的人同它合作。
    他表示欢迎一切同印度共产党对立的党派提出建设性的批评。
    当选为邦议会共产党议会党团领袖的印度共产党政治局委员南布迪里巴德，同一天在一次记者招待会上说，喀拉拉邦新政府所面临的主要问题是消除腐化和提高农民、工人阶级和其他收入低的人民的生活水平。他说，正在准备组织邦政府的共产党的邦长们将在生活方式上保持勤俭朴素，使人民认识到事物的新秩序已经出现。共产党领导的政府将奉行维护工人的政策，对于属于各种不同工会的工人不予任何歧视。他还说，共产党领导的政府不会干涉任何教派的宗教活动或社会活动。
