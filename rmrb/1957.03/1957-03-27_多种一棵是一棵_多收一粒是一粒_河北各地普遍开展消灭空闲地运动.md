Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 22nd - A widespread movement to eliminate idle land is unfolding across Hebei Province. According to recent information, statistics from some agricultural cooperatives in the Baoding, Handan, and Tianjin regions alone show that, in conjunction with preparations for spring plowing, they have mobilized members to cultivate more than 25,000 mu of scattered idle land that was left barren in previous years, including roadsides, field ridges, ditch banks, threshing grounds, gravesides, as well as around wells, houses, and vacant courtyards. They plan to plant grains, oil crops, or vegetables, etc., according to local conditions.

The Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative in Linzhang County, under the slogan of "Plant one more tree if you can, harvest one more grain if you can, accumulate small gains into large ones," has three hundred male and female members cultivating small plots of idle land every day. They have already opened up more than five hundred mu. Calculating a harvest of 100 jin per mu, the cooperative will increase its production by 50,000 jin of grain in the autumn. The Shigecunzhuang Township Agricultural Cooperative in Wen'an County originally had a low-lying area of more than 4,000 mu that was waterlogged year-round and unsuitable for cultivation. During this movement to eliminate idle land, the members came up with the idea of building a 500-meter-long earth embankment to convert the low-lying area into rice paddies, with a planned yield of 800 jin per mu. The Jimingcun District in Zunhua County launched a movement to plant "one hundred clumps of miscellaneous grains" per person on idle land. Calculating a harvest of 50 jin of miscellaneous grains per hundred clumps, the 10,034 male and female laborers in the district can harvest an additional 500,000 jin of grain.

In the movement to eliminate idle land and expand cultivated area, agricultural cooperatives in various localities have assigned dedicated personnel to conduct surveys of the scattered idle land around their respective cooperatives, clarifying the situation. At the same time, they have made unified plans for the identified idle land, delineating the scope of operation for teams, groups, and individual members, and clarifying that whoever plants harvests, thus combining collective interests with the individual interests of the members, which has stimulated the enthusiasm of the broad masses of members.

　　多种一棵是一棵　多收一粒是一粒
　　河北各地普遍开展消灭空闲地运动
    新华社保定22日电　一个广泛的消灭空闲地运动正在河北省各地普遍展开。据最近了解，仅保定、邯郸、天津专区部分农业社的统计，已发动社员结合备耕工作，将往年荒废的道边、地埂、沟埝、场面、坟边以及井台、宅旁、空院等零散闲地二万五千多亩翻耕起来，准备因地制宜的种上粮食、油料或蔬菜等作物。
    临漳县曙光农业社在多种一棵是一棵，多收一粒是一粒，聚少成多的口号下，每天有三百个男女社员开垦小片空闲地，现在已开出五百多亩，按每亩收获百斤计算，秋后全社即可增产五万斤粮食。文安县史各庄乡农业社，原来有一块四千多亩常年积水不能耕种的洼地，在这次消灭空闲地运动中，经社员们出主意，决定筑一条五百公尺长的大土埝，在洼内改种稻田，计划每亩可收八百斤。遵化县鸡鸣村区开展了在空闲地上每人增种“百簇杂粮”的运动。按一百簇收获五十斤杂粮计算，全区一万零三十四名男女劳力种植的杂粮，即可多收粮食五十万斤。
    在消灭空闲土地，扩大耕地面积运动中，各地农业社均责成专人对本社周围的零星闲地进行了勘查，摸清了底细。同时对查出的空闲地进行了统一规划，划出队、组和社员个人经营的范围，并明确了谁种谁收，使集体利益和社员个人利益结合起来，因此，激发了广大社员的积极性。
