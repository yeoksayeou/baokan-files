Developing local sources of goods through the business method of "obtaining materials locally, producing locally, and selling locally" has many benefits. First, it can extensively utilize local resources to develop local industry. Second, it can increase local sources of goods and reduce long-distance transportation of some commodities. Third, it can produce goods that satisfy consumers' needs according to their requirements. Therefore, this method is both a way to increase production and a way to economize.

However, to do this work well, the first important issue is to further "strengthen the relationship between industry and commerce in terms of production and sales." The Shenyang Cultural Goods Company has made achievements in this area.

The employees of the Shenyang Cultural Goods Company actively went to factories and handicraft cooperatives to understand their production potential and also conveyed consumer opinions to the factories. They also helped factories and cooperatives solve difficulties in production, such as the shortage of raw materials and low technical levels. For example, when trial-producing red and blue pencils, the factory lacked technical personnel. Through their efforts, they finally found three technicians to help the factory successfully trial-produce red and blue pencils. The result of their actions was not only a continuous increase in the supply of goods for the commercial sector but also beneficial to the development of local industrial products.

However, the commercial departments in some areas do not pay enough attention to organizing local sources of goods and lack the spirit of actively helping local industries solve their difficulties. They even pursue "famous brands" and make long-distance purchases. This approach neither helps local industries develop production nor meets market needs in a timely manner. At the same time, because purchasing personnel from various places concentrate on purchasing goods in a few large cities, it inevitably creates an artificial supply shortage for some commodities that are already limited in production. Therefore, strengthening the relationship between production and sales and developing local sources of goods are very important for improving the current market supply situation.

### 开辟地方货源

    开辟地方货源
    “就地取材，就地生产，就地销售”的经营方法好处很多。一，可以广泛利用地方资源，发展地方工业；二，可以增加地方货源，减少一些商品远程运输；三，可以根据消费者的要求，生产消费者满意的商品。所以，这种办法既是增产之道，也是节约之道。
    但是，要做好这件工作，首先一个重要的问题，就是进一步“密切工商之间的产销关系”。沈阳市文化用品公司，在这个工作上做出了成绩。
    沈阳市文化用品公司的职工们，主动地到工厂和手工业合作社去，了解了工厂、合作社的生产潜力，也给工厂反映了消费者的意见；他们还帮助工厂和合作社解决在生产中原料不足、技术低等困难，如：试制红蓝铅笔的时候，工厂缺少技术人员，在他们的努力下，终于找到了三名技术人员，帮助工厂成功地试制了红蓝铅笔。他们这样做的结果，不仅使商业部门的货源不断增加，而且也有利于地方工业产品的发展。
    但是，有些地方的商业部门，不太重视组织地方货源，更缺乏主动帮助地方工业解决困难的精神。甚至为了追逐“名牌货”而远程采购。这种做法，既不能帮助地方工业发展生产、又不能及时满足市场需要；同时，由于各地采购人员集中到几个大城市里采购商品，对一些生产本来有限的商品，就免不了造成人为的供应紧张。因此，密切产销关系，开辟地方货源，对改进目前市场供应工作是很重要的。
