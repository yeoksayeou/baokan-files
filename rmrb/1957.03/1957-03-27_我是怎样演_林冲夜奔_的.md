    The play "Lin Chong's Night Flight" has a very prominent characteristic: the script is not only very concise but also full of strong expressiveness. The performance of the character's emotions must be coordinated with the script. For example, when reciting the eight lines of poetry, "Wishing to send my gaze a thousand miles high, sorrowful clouds hang low over the road to Hengyang…", one should fully express the feeling of a fallen hero longing for his hometown. When reciting, "A man does not shed tears easily, only when grief is unbearable," it should contain a sense of sorrow, but it must not give people the feeling of pessimism. Then, in the "epilogue": "One night running through the wilderness, risking my life to escape, I will borrow troops from Liangshan and sweep away the treacherous officials," the emotion is different from before. At this time, Lin Chong has already arrived near Liangshan, and his mood is no longer as tense as when he was walking at night, fearing being discovered and chased. However, the hatred for Gao Qiu in his heart is burning like a raging fire. He cannot forget the frame-ups and humiliations suffered at the hands of the treacherous officials, and he is certain that one day he will eliminate them.

    I really like this play, especially Lin Chong's heroic spirit and upright, unyielding character. Although I have performed this play hundreds of times, I have never relaxed in each performance. On the stage, infected by the role, it seems as if I am experiencing the same misfortunes, unconsciously becoming a captive of the character.

    Through each performance of "Lin Chong's Night Flight," I always have different experiences. Compared with the original, I always feel that I am not good enough in portraying Lin Chong.

    During this performance in Shanghai, I received guidance from the veteran Peking Opera artist Gai Jiaotian, which brought me many new gains. After Gai Jiaotian watched my performances of "Lin Chong's Night Flight," "Wu Song Fights the Tiger," and "Single Sword Meeting," I visited him a few days later to ask for guidance. He was very straightforward and received me like an old friend, and agreed to my request. He very meticulously corrected and pointed out the things I had not done well, and very sincerely demonstrated them. For example, before, after my initial appearance on stage, my eyes would only focus on one point in front of me. Gai Jiaotian asked me to look around in several different directions, according to the character's environment, to show that I was observing the surrounding environment to see if I was being discovered. This is completely reasonable, and I have now modified my performance accordingly. Through this study, I not only enriched my portrayal of Lin Chong, but also became good friends with this energetic old gentleman in his sixties.

    In short, the reason why my performance of "Lin Chong's Night Flight" is loved by the audience is inseparable from the teachings of the old master and the guidance and help of friends in the literary and artistic circles. For example, Mr. Cheng Yanqiu and other fellow artists have encouraged me, and some old friends with higher literary cultivation often explain the plot and script to me. Their concern and love for me and for art are constantly urging me to seize the time to study hard. Now, although I like this play the most, have performed it the most times, and have learned some things from the old master, it does not mean that it is completely perfect. There are still many shortcomings in the performance of this play. Artistic creation and improvement are endless. I sincerely hope that the audience can give their opinions without reservation after watching the play. This will be of great help to the development of Kunqu Opera. (End)

### 我是怎样演“林冲夜奔”的

　　我是怎样演“林冲夜奔”的
　　侯永奎
    “林冲夜奔”这出戏有一个极大的特点，剧词不但非常精练，而且富有强烈的表现力，人物情绪的表演，必须配合剧词。譬如：念“欲送登高千里目，愁云低锁衡阳路，……”八句诗，应该完全把一个落魄英雄那种怀念家乡的心情表示出来。如念到“丈夫有泪不轻弹，只因未到伤心处。”应该含有一种悲伤的情绪，但决不能使人感到是悲观。再如“尾声”里：“一宵儿奔走荒郊，穷性命挣出一条，到梁山借得兵来，定把你奸臣扫”一段，就和前面的情绪不同了。这时林冲已经来到梁山近处，心情再不像夜间走路时怕被人发现和追赶的那样紧张，可是内心里对高俅的仇恨却像烈火一样地在燃烧着，他不能忘记受奸臣的陷害与凌辱，确信终有一天，定会把奸臣除掉。
    我很喜欢这出戏，尤其是林冲那种豪迈的英雄气派和耿直不屈的性格。虽然这出戏我已演过不止几百次，可是每次演出中，从来没有松过劲儿。在舞台上，由于受到角色的感染，好像这就是自己所受的遭遇，不自觉地作了角色的俘虏。
    通过“林冲夜奔”的每场演出，自己总有些不同的体会，和原来的东西相形对比之下，总感觉自己在表现林冲这个人物上还很不够。
    这次在上海演出时，又曾经得到京剧界老前辈盖叫天先生的指导，使我又有了不少新的收获。当盖叫天先生看了我演的“林冲夜奔”、“武松打虎”和“单刀会”以后，过几天我去拜访了他，请他指教。他很爽快，立刻像老朋友似地接待了我，并答应了我的要求。他非常细致地纠正和指出了我所没有做到的地方，又十分诚恳地加以示范。如：从前我刚出场亮相后，眼神只是向前集中地看某一点。盖叫天先生要求我根据人物所处的环境，应该是向几个不同的方向多看几眼，以表示在观察四周的环境，是否被人发现。这样做完全合理，现在我演出时已按此修改。通过这次学习，不但又丰富了我对林冲人物的表演，而且也和这位年逾花甲、精力充沛的老前辈成了要好的朋友。
    总之，我演“林冲夜奔”之所以能为观众所喜爱，这是和老先生的教导，以及文学艺术界的朋友们的指导与帮助分不开的。如：程砚秋先生和其他同行好友们都曾经鼓励过我，一些文学修养较高的老朋友们，也经常为我讲解剧情和剧词。他们对我和对艺术这种关心与爱护的态度，随时在督促着我得抓紧时间努力学习。现在，尽管我最喜欢这出戏，演的次数也最多，也从老先生那里得到了一些东西。但是，这并不等于就完全尽美尽善了，在这出戏里的表演上，还是有不少缺点的。艺术上的创造与提高是永无止境的。我衷心地希望观众们看过戏之后，能毫不客气地提出意见。这会对昆曲艺术事业的发展有很大帮助的。　（完）
