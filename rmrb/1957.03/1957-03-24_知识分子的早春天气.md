    The Early Spring Weather of Intellectuals
    Fei Xiaotong
    I would like to talk about intellectuals, about the feelings of some of my old friends who teach in universities, whom I am familiar with. What I'm going to talk about is nothing more than a limited view, a temporary feeling; writing it out is just something like an essay.
  I was away from home for half a year, and not long after I returned, I received a notice from the Labor Cadre School inviting me to attend a symposium to discuss Mr. Chen Da's outline of a paper on population issues. Mr. Chen is one of my teachers. Many friends are familiar with him. He is a scholar who has been the same for decades, a veteran of sociology, a gray-haired professor whose students fill his halls. Since liberation, he has been constantly studying, but his name is rarely seen in newspapers and magazines, and his books can no longer be found in bookstores. Old friends in the profession often inquire about Mr. Chen's recent situation. This notice is good news. His scientific research work is active again. Also, I arrived home just in time for the Spring Festival, and the next day I saw Mr. Li Jinghan's "The Past and Present of Rural Family Life in the Suburbs of Beijing" in the People's Daily. This article was serialized for three days. Mr. Li is another veteran in the profession, the author of "Rural Families in the Suburbs of Beiping," published thirty years ago. I remember that about a year ago, at a symposium on the issue of intellectuals convened by the China Democratic League, Mr. Li mentioned that since the restructuring of colleges and departments, he had prepared three different new courses in more than three years, none of which had the opportunity to be taught. Although he used an extremely humorous tone, relating it very lightly, the friends present were silent for a long time. At that time, no one could have imagined that he would offer this precious gift this Spring Festival. In my opinion, he not only reported the good news of the improvement of rural family life but also reported the good news of the victory of the policy on intellectuals.
  Spring has come to the world, and even old trees have sprouted new branches.
  I didn't have this feeling until I returned to Beijing. Last summer, when I first arrived in Kunming, I met Mr. Liu Wendian, who had recently returned from Chengdu's Thatched Cottage after interviewing for annotating Du Fu's poems. At the end of last year, Mr. Zhang Wenyuan invited me to a small restaurant for a farewell dinner, talking a lot about the typesetting machine he was designing. In the past six months, the changes in intellectuals have been quite significant. How can one not look at a scholar with new eyes after three days of separation?
  This is, of course, a matter of course. In the past few years, after storm-like movements, infected by multiple high tides of socialist victory, and with accumulated learning, intellectuals have already begun to change. In January last year, Premier Zhou's report on the issue of intellectuals, like spring thunder, played a role in awakening the dormant, and then, with the gentle breeze of a hundred schools of thought contending, the positive factors of intellectuals moved in response to the times. But for the average old intellectual, it still seems like early spring weather. Their vitality is just beginning to emerge, but they are still a little shy, their confidence is not so strong, and their concerns seem to be many. Early spring weather is inevitably cold and warm, which is the most difficult time to take care of. Looking closer, there are still many problems. Of course, there are always problems, but the current problems are different from the past after all.
  At the end of the year before last, I traveled to Nanjing, Suzhou, and Hangzhou. Along the way, I also met many old friends. In their conversations, one could feel a sense of loneliness: that sense of helplessness that arises in one's heart when one encounters a beloved thing but feels that one has no part in it. When these old intellectuals understood what socialism was, they wholeheartedly yearned for it. But they inevitably discovered that they were a step late, it seemed that there was no place for them in the advancing team, how could they not feel the sigh of "laughter gradually unheard, voices gradually silent, the sentimental are annoyed by the heartless." In the second half of last year, I was running around in the southwest, and I didn't hear much of this kind of sigh among my friends. The encouraging effect of Premier Zhou's report on those friends who felt lonely was beyond words; some even used "second liberation" to describe their feelings. The status of intellectuals in the new society has been affirmed, and their hearts have settled down. With peace of mind, they will look forward, to see their own future, and therefore, they have also put forward new demands on themselves. Some dare to apply to join the Party, some privately plan to buy some large books with surplus money and do some basic construction. This kind of long-term planning reflects the change in the minds of those old intellectuals. Not to mention others, even I have moved the Twenty-Four Histories to my bookshelf, and recently bought a Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government.
    This kind of mood of intellectuals is gratifying, it is a positive factor, breeding the requirements for progress, and also raising new problems.
  What are the main demands of these intellectuals now?
  It is difficult to answer this question in general terms. I can only try to figure it out within the scope of a group of friends I am more familiar with. Some intellectuals' New Year wishes were published in the newspaper in the New Year. Mr. Li Da, the president of Wuhan University, said it very simply: to be a full-time professor or a full-time researcher. What do you want after becoming a professor? At a symposium at Chengdu Institute of Technology, Professor Kang Zhenhuang summed up the wishes of many friends present: "One room, two books," meaning to be able to quietly do homework.
    To understand these requirements, one must tell the origin. More than a year ago, intellectuals were distressed that they could not use their strength; this problem has been basically solved in the past year, and now they feel that their strength is insufficient and require improvement.
    After Premier Zhou's report, schools in various places have done a lot of work on the issue of intellectuals, improving their living and working conditions. Comparing the two, living conditions seem to have improved more. For example, wages have increased, and many teachers who only had enough for food and clothing in the past can now buy books, and even households with many children and sick family members have mostly received special care. Generally speaking, the problems in life have been basically solved. Intellectuals are satisfied, even a little ashamed. And in the past period of time, many schools have also taken very good care of senior intellectuals. For example, in order to save time queuing for haircuts, medical treatment, and grocery shopping, senior intellectuals are given priority treatment, and even going to the theater can reserve front-row seats. Senior intellectuals are naturally grateful for these preferential treatments, but this also makes them overly prominent, making others feel uncomfortable, and even causing resentment among the masses. Whether these methods are appropriate is still worth considering. I myself have not used these preferential tickets, because it is embarrassing to take them out.
    It should be said that the improvement of living conditions is basic, but this is not the focus now. In response to the requirements of intellectuals, the main thing now is to help them improve their professional skills. Let's talk about their professional situation first. In the early days of teaching reform, teachers were nervous for a while. That was because they had to learn from the Soviet Union, many textbooks had to be newly compiled, and because after ideological remolding movements, many teachers negated what they had learned, and a new system had not been established, resulting in some gaps. So they rushed to learn Russian and translate lectures, which seemed very busy. In the past two years, have they learned the Soviet Union thoroughly? Has a new academic system been established? I think it is not all like this. But the difficulty of attending classes seems to be relatively small. That is because on the one hand, teachers have improved, and on the other hand, a set of lectures has been compiled, and there is no big problem in reading from the book in class. But last year, new situations occurred, and the result of anti-dogmatism put forward new requirements for teachers. To cultivate students who can think independently, teachers must first think independently. In the past, different statements from the textbook, whether they believed it or not, could be kept silent, but now they have to talk about the similarities and differences between the various schools, which inevitably requires criticism. If they have not studied it themselves, the reasoning will not be clear. In the past, they could verbally repeat some theories they didn't quite agree with, but now it is difficult to reconcile what they say with what they think, and even it is difficult to justify themselves. In the past, they could follow the authorities to criticize those different sayings that they had never even seen the original book of, but now they will be exposed if others ask questions. In short, now it is not easy to teach without a little real talent and learning. The reason why anti-dogmatism can improve the quality of teaching lies here, and the reason why it causes teachers' professional tension also lies here.
    Many friends I have come into contact with support anti-dogmatism and are positive about their own requirements for improving their professional skills. Their requirements for help are also real. The saying "one room, two books" to quietly do homework refers to this. To be more specific, they require to carry out scientific research, to have the opportunity to attend academic conferences, and even to leave production for a period of further study, and to study abroad, etc. This kind of requirement is good and should be said to be valuable.
    Now let us look at the actual situation, how is the scientific research to help teachers improve their professional skills carried out? Some schools are better, some schools are worse. Generally speaking, I don't think it has met the requirements of teachers.
    If we study the situation where scientific research work is not satisfactory enough, what is the key problem? Is it that the working conditions are not good? I don't think so. Teachers' working conditions have been greatly improved in the past six months. First of all, let's talk about the time issue that was the most contentious in the past. Since the regulation of six-fifths of the business hours, universities in various places have thought of many ways to implement it, and the effect is not bad. In the first half of last year, about three-quarters of the teachers in Beijing's universities were guaranteed. In August, I went to Kunming and heard that less than one-fifth of the teachers in Yunnan University could not guarantee business hours. At the beginning of this year, I learned that in some schools, the proportion of teachers who could not guarantee business hours had dropped to less than one-tenth. Although this problem cannot be said to be completely solved, and the situation mentioned by Mr. Li Da in his New Year's wishes still exists, and those who cannot guarantee business hours are mostly capable of scientific research, generally speaking, the time problem is no longer the main obstacle to carrying out scientific research. Secondly, what about the conditions of books, materials, instruments, and equipment? These conditions are unbalanced in various places and schools. In the past year, the purchase of books in various schools has generally increased. The main problem now is not the lack of books, but the slow cataloging, difficult circulation, and insufficient distribution. There are still many problems in the production, supply, repair, and use of instruments, especially in inland and border areas. But in the past year, we have done a lot of work in these areas. Except for special topics, generally, no one has been unable to conduct scientific research due to the lack of conditions in these areas.
    So what is the most important problem for teachers in universities to carry out scientific research now? I think it is insufficient specific leadership. During this half-year trip, I saw that wherever the leadership of teachers' scientific research work has been strengthened, the teachers in these schools have also worked with peace of mind, their professional skills have been improved, and the students are also satisfied; wherever the leadership in this area has been relaxed, the teachers are confused and distressed, and their emotions are also more. This difference is understandable. Teachers are actively demanding to improve their professional skills, and they feel at ease when they have a goal. If enthusiasm rises and there are demands, but they cannot be met and they cannot see the direction of their efforts, their hearts will be in chaos.
    I am not clear about how scientific research work is carried out in universities across the country, but I know that there are still many schools that have not seriously led scientific research work. Some schools treat "marching towards science" as a movement, and after making an appeal-oriented mobilization report, they issue forms for teachers to fill in topics and make plans, and even reach out for results after a while. What kind of research should be done in universities? How should scientific research and teaching be combined? What problems should each department focus on? How should teachers be organized, divided, cooperated, and helped each other? What specific conditions are required for research? How to help overcome difficulties encountered in work? How to organize discussions to improve academic thinking? - This series of questions is obviously not something that any teacher can solve alone. Specific leadership is required on these issues. If the school leadership does not go deep into reality, rely on teachers with experience in scientific research, and gradually solve these problems with the development of the work, teachers, no matter how positive they are subjectively, will not be able to carry out scientific research work, or it will be somewhat chaotic. I have met friends who have filled in scientific research plan forms several times, but when they see me, they still say that the direction of scientific research is unclear, the topics are difficult to find, and even some are not clear about what they have filled in on the form. For these friends, marching towards science is like a gust of wind, only "ruffling a pool of spring water." In addition, some friends are eager to catch up with the world level, and they do not consider the actual conditions enough. As soon as they start, they first clash with the existing teaching tasks, time conflicts, and they cannot take care of their energy, resulting in contradictions. I have also noticed that some school leaders are not anxious about the first situation, and they are waiting and seeing, satisfied with completing the current teaching tasks, and the scientific research forms have been reported to the superiors and submitted. They are quite sensitive to the second situation, fearing that teaching tasks will be affected. They do not analyze why this situation occurs, and they are even less aware that this is the result of a lack of specific leadership; instead, they shout that there is a contradiction between teaching and scientific research, and that teachers are fame-seeking and value research over teaching. It seems that they have found a legitimate reason for waiting and seeing and filling out forms. This kind of shouting is detrimental to the enthusiasm of teachers. Pushing up and pulling down, it is difficult to advance or retreat, how can they not be confused in their thinking and how can their emotions not be affected? It is necessary to further clarify how to carry out scientific research in universities. If there is really a contradiction between scientific research and teaching in universities and scientific research cannot be carried out freely, we must also come up with a specific way to improve the professional level of teachers. I have not conducted in-depth research on this issue, but I always feel that the solution is not to freeze scientific research and ensure teaching, but to strengthen specific leadership of scientific research and closely combine it with teaching. Is there too much or too little scientific research in universities? I think this question is worth checking.
    The active demand of intellectuals to improve their professional skills reflects that they have consciously realized that their professional level is not enough to adapt to the rapid development of socialist construction. This consciousness indicates that their political awareness has been improved, which is the effect of ideological remolding and learning in the past few years. If they still consider themselves bystanders of the socialist cause, why should they suffer so much that they do not go to bed until midnight? I want to emphasize that it is not good to say that intellectuals engage in scientific research for fame and fortune, which is a personal plan, because it does not conform to the facts.
    Next, I would like to talk about the contention of a hundred schools of thought.
    The contention of a hundred schools of thought has really hit the hearts of many intellectuals, which is great. The ideological remolding of intellectuals started from the level of standpoint. It seems easier to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, but when it comes to viewpoints and methods, the problem of idealism and materialism arises, which seems not simple. For example, supporting the Party and the government, loving the country and the people, is easy for intellectuals to understand, but to criticize the bourgeois idealistic ideological system, many people are not clear about what is materialistic and what is idealistic. If the boundary between materialism and idealism is not clear, we can only simply draw a line, saying that all academics taught in bourgeois countries are idealistic, and all academics taught in socialist countries are materialistic. If this line is drawn correctly, things will be easier. Books in English and American fill the bookshelf and are sold as waste paper; if you don't have time to learn Russian, you can buy translated pamphlets to read. When writing articles and giving lectures, cite a few more quotations and scold a few American and British scholars. These are easy to do, and many people have done so. But after learning some dialectical materialism, they will gradually feel that this simple method of drawing lines seems very problematic, and it feels a bit like children watching stage plays, not understanding the plot, but looking at white faces or red faces, and cheering when white faces are beaten. They gradually understand that it is not right to think that what those people say must be materialistic and what those people say must be idealistic. They began to demand to distinguish between idealism and materialism from the academic ideas themselves. I think this should be said to be a step forward in learning, but with this step, there are more problems, and the mood becomes more complicated. They very much hope to clarify the case and clarify which of their academic ideas are materialistic and which are idealistic. But before the principle of a hundred schools of thought contending was put forward, there was no such condition.
    If positive things are not done well, they can become negative things. It should be affirmed that the demand to clarify the boundary between materialism and idealism is positive, but if the conditions are not met and this demand cannot be satisfied, others will still treat him as a red face or a white face, and he will be unconvinced and emotional. I have realized that there is such a situation in learning from the Soviet Union. At first, some people did oppose learning from the Soviet Union, which was essentially a matter of standpoint. But recently, there have been some emotions of dissatisfaction with the attitude of learning from the Soviet Union. If it is not analyzed, it will be felt that the standpoint is unstable again, but in fact, the nature is different from the past. In the past period of time, some places have indeed simplified learning from the Soviet Union. Some things from the Soviet Union are not necessarily correct, and some people who raise doubts or different opinions are criticized, so emotions arise. These emotions do not arise from the issue of standpoint. But once there are emotions, negative factors will also grow, which is not good.
    The contention of a hundred schools of thought happens to solve these problems arising from the ideological development of intellectuals. According to my understanding, the contention of a hundred schools of thought is to clarify right and wrong through free discussion, which is a further ideological remolding of intellectuals, and a further acceptance of dialectical materialism in terms of viewpoints and methods. Now, the vast majority of intellectuals have the demand to accept dialectical materialism. They hope to concretely clarify which are materialistic and which are idealistic, why idealism is wrong, and enter the working class ideologically convincingly. They welcome the contention of a hundred schools of thought, because the contention of a hundred schools of thought can guarantee that no correct thing will be wronged, and it gives any point that can grow into a correct thing sufficient conditions for development. In this way, we can prevent the positive from turning into the negative, and fully develop the potential of intellectuals.
      How has the principle of "a hundred schools of thought contending" been implemented? Compared with "marching towards science," it seems to be a little worse. First, from the perspective of intellectuals: they are enthusiastic about the contention of a hundred schools of thought; they are enthusiastic in their hearts, but their mouths are still tight, and it is best for others to contend and listen to themselves. To come forward themselves, they have to take a look and wait and see, not to be the first in the world. According to the scope I have come into contact with, most people are still unwilling to open up and expose their thoughts. In the past year, the situation has improved somewhat. Under certain circumstances, some people are willing to confide some heartfelt words, but they are still quite shy. Marching towards science can be done behind closed doors, but the contention of a hundred schools of thought requires showing your face, and it cannot be contended if you are shy.
    What are you worried about? Of course, there are still people who do not understand the principle of a hundred schools of thought contending. They are afraid that it is a trap, collecting some ideological information, so that they can be properly rectified when another movement comes. Not too many people can say this. More people are afraid of making fools of themselves. If you don't speak and just carry books to class, no one can measure how much stuff is in your stomach. If you show your face, you will show your true colors. To put it bluntly, there is still a "face problem" here. The face problem is not simple. I remember that at one symposium, a friend said vividly, he said, I am not afraid of being criticized, we have been criticized before, and academic debates have been held, but now we can't bear it, because once someone says that they have idealism, the faces of the students in class tomorrow will be different, and their feet will be weak. Face is a very realistic thing. Being labeled as a "backward element" will be put in a cold palace, which will always affect the material foundation, because this is "virtue", and salary evaluation, promotion, further study abroad, and even dating and finding a lover will be affected. This trend is changing now, but it is difficult to change the accumulated habits, and the scope involved is wide, and it cannot be changed all at once. Intellectuals who have not completely eliminated the idea of "protecting oneself wisely" and "not suffering immediate losses" think that it is okay not to speak, and that speaking may cause trouble, so why bother to speak.
    On the other hand, have the people who specifically lead the work of intellectuals understood the principle of a hundred schools of thought contending? Not all of them understand it. Some have concerns from the beginning. "The principles set by the Central Committee are certainly correct, but our specific situation here does not have the conditions." Then some people want to circle the scope of this principle: first circle it in academics, then circle it outside of teaching, so that there will be no problems. When the contention starts, and they smell some idealism, some people sound the alarm: "Idealism is rampant," "Bourgeois ideas have emerged again." It looks like they have finally suppressed the demons, and once this stone tablet is uncovered, they will rush out and disrupt the world. Although there are not many people who resist this principle, it seems that there are not a few people who are not enthusiastic about this principle and are waiting to see.
      "The grass color looks remotely, but there is nothing close by" - this is the scenery that early spring weather should have.
    The early spring weather of intellectuals means that their enthusiasm has been mobilized, especially in the demand to improve their professional skills, but there are still many negative factors. They are still full of concerns about the contention of a hundred schools of thought, and they dare not contend; as for the issues that are more closely related to actual politics, most of them are even more tight-lipped, with a bit of an air of aloofness. For example, when the Polish and Hungarian events occurred, I was traveling in the border area and did not directly hear the reactions of senior intellectuals at that time, but when I returned to the city at the end of last year and talked to my friends about these things, my impression was that such a big thing did not cause much fluctuation among senior intellectuals. On the one hand, this is good, indicating that the standpoints of these intellectuals of ours are stable; but on the other hand, if we understand it carefully, we can see that they are not very stable because they have distinguished right from wrong in their thinking very clearly, but they have not thought deeply about it, the ancient well has not rippled, and they do not care much.
    I think that not caring much about world and national affairs may be the general situation of many senior intellectuals now. This situation is certainly not new, and it has been going on for a long time. Once I was chatting with a few friends and we talked about why many friends don't care much about politics. One friend said something very interesting. He said that there are probably four reasons: first, there is a fairly common idea that national affairs are naturally taken care of by capable people, and they don't need to worry about them. Everyone does believe that the leadership of the Communist Party cannot be wrong, and they are very relieved, as long as they follow the Communist Party well and do their job well, that is enough. Secondly, many people lack confidence in themselves, and without waiting for others to criticize them, they often ask themselves whether old ideas are emerging again, so they don't have their own opinions and ideas about world affairs or national affairs, and they only start thinking after the People's Daily publishes an editorial. Third, they consciously feel that they are very ignorant of world affairs, not to mention other things, even the names of many foreigners sound awkward. If they are not familiar with the situation, there is no material to think about. Fourth, they have developed the lazy habit of not learning without arrangements over the years. We have tried to put a hat on these ideas, but none of the hats fit very well. Is it wrong to trust the Party and accept leadership? Of course, you can't say that. But how can trust become dependence? It is good to be humble, but how can you not have your own opinions? In any case, in general, not caring enough about national affairs is always a negative thing.
    Why do these ideological situations occur? What do these ideological situations illustrate? The friends who were chatting with me admitted that they were not good enough and could not explain it clearly. We seem to feel that does this reflect that these intellectuals feel that it makes no difference to the country or to themselves whether they ask about national affairs or not? What is the relationship between having an opinion and not having an opinion? Is it that they feel that it seems unnecessary to actively put forward opinions, and others may not consider it, without saying a word, the country's affairs are still handled very well? If this is really the idea, does it mean that the political enthusiasm of these intellectuals has not been well developed? So how can we develop their enthusiasm in this regard? - When it comes to these issues, I think it may exceed the scope of this essay. That's a matter for when spring is in full bloom.

    知识分子的早春天气
    费孝通
    我想谈谈知识分子，谈谈我所熟悉的一些在高等学校里教书的老朋友们的心情。所谈的无非是一隅之见，一时之感；写出来还是杂文之类的东西而已。
  出门半年，回家不久，接到一个通知，是劳动干部学校邀我去参加一个座谈会，讨论陈达先生的一篇有关人口问题论文的提纲。陈先生是我的一位老师。提起他，很多朋友是熟悉的；他是个几十年如一日的学者，社会学的老前辈，桃李满门墙的灰发教授。解放以来，一直还是手不释卷，但是报纸杂志上却很少见他的名字，书店里也已经找不到他所写的书，同行老朋友见面时常会互相打听陈先生近来怎样了。这个通知是一个喜讯。他老人家的科学研究工作又活跃起来了。还有，到家刚逢春节，次日在人民日报上看到了李景汉先生写的“北京郊区乡村家庭生活的今昔”。这篇文章连载了三天。李先生又是一位同行的老前辈，三十年前出版的“北平郊外之乡村家庭”一书的作者。我记得大概一年多前，在一个民盟召集的关于知识分子问题的座谈会上，李先生曾说起过他自从院系调整后，三年多来已准备过三门不同的而都没有上堂机会的新功课。尽管他用了极为幽默的口吻，很轻松地道来，在座的朋友却半响接不上话头。那时谁也想不到，他今年春节会献出这份珍贵的礼物。在我看来，他不仅报了乡村家庭生活改善的喜讯，同时也报了知识分子政策胜利的喜讯。
  春到人间，老树也竟然茁出了新枝。
  这个感觉并不是回到了北京才有的。去年暑假，我初到昆明，曾会见过不久前为了笺注杜诗特地到成都草堂去采访回来的刘文典老先生。去年年底，张文渊先生邀我去吃小馆子送行，大谈他正在设计中的排字机器。这半年多来，知识分子的变化可真不小。士隔三日怎能不刮目而视？
  这自是情理之中的事。几年来，经过了狂风暴雨般的运动，受到了多次社会主义胜利高潮的感染，加上日积月累的学习，知识分子原本已起了变化。去年1月，周总理关于知识分子问题的报告，像春雷般起了惊蛰作用，接着百家争鸣的和风一吹，知识分子的积极因素应时而动了起来。但是对一般老知识分子来说，现在好像还是早春天气。他们的生气正在冒头，但还有一点腼腆，自信力不那么强，顾虑似乎不少。早春天气，未免乍寒乍暖，这原是最难将息的时节。逼近一看，问题还是不少的。当然，问题总是有的，但当前的问题毕竟和过去的不同了。
  前年年底，我曾到南京、苏州、杭州去走过一趟。一路上也会到不少老朋友。在他们谈吐之间，令人感觉到有一种寂寞之感：当一个人碰到一桩心爱的事而自己却又觉得没有份的时候，心里油然而生的那种无可奈何的意味。这些老知识分子当他们搞清楚了社会主义是什么的时候，他们是倾心向往的。但是未免发觉得迟了一步，似乎前进的队伍里已没有他们的地位，心上怎能不浮起了墙外行人的“笑渐不闻声渐悄，多情却被无情恼”的感叹。去年下半年，我一直在西南一带东跑西走，在朋友中听到的这种感叹是不多了。周总理的报告对于那些心怀寂寞的朋友们所起的鼓舞作用是难以言喻的，甚至有人用了“再度解放”来形容自己的心情。知识分子在新社会里的地位是肯定了，心跟着落了窠，安了。心安了，眼睛会向前看，要看出自己前途，因此，对自己也提出了新的要求。有的敢于申请入党了，有的私下计议，有余钱买些大部头书，搞点基本建设。这种长期打算念头正反映那些老知识分子心情的转变。不说别人，连我自己都把二十四史搬上了书架，最近还买了一部资治通鉴。
    知识分子这种心情是可喜的，这是积极因素，蕴育着进步的要求，也提出了新的问题。
  这些知识分子当前主要的要求是什么呢？
  要概括地答复这个问题是有困难的。我只能就比较熟悉的一部分朋友们这个范围里来捉摸捉摸。新年里报纸上曾发表过一些知识分子的新年愿望。武汉大学校长李达先生说得很干脆：要做一个专任教授或专任研究员。做了教授之后要什么呢？在成都工学院的一次座谈会上康振黄教授总结了在座许多朋友们的心愿：“一间房，二本书”，意思是要能静静地做做功课。
    要体会这些要求，得说个由来。一年多前知识分子苦恼的是有力使不上；一年来这个问题基本解决了，现在感觉到自己力量不足，要求提高。
    周总理报告之后，各地学校在知识分子问题上都做了不少工作，改善了他们的生活条件和工作条件，两者比较起来，生活条件似乎改善得更多一些。比如工资提高了，过去许多只够衣食的教师们现在可以买买书了，就是子女多，家属中有病人的困难户也大多得到了特殊照顾。生活上的问题总的说来基本上是解决了。知识分子是满意的，甚至有点受之有愧。而且过去这一段时间里，很多学校里对高级知识分子照顾得也非常周到。比如为了剪发、医疗、买菜等排队费时间，给高级知识分子优先待遇，甚至看戏都可以预定前排坐位。高级知识分子对于这些优待自然是领情的，但是这也使他们过分突出，叫别人看来不很舒服，甚至引起了群众的反感。这些办法是否妥当还值得考虑。我自己就没有用过这些优待券，因为拿出来怪不好意思的。
    应当说生活条件的改善是基本的，但是现在这已不是重点了。针对知识分子的要求来说，现在主要是要帮助他们提高业务。先谈谈他们的业务情况罢。在教学改革初期，教师们曾经紧张过一阵。那是由于要学习苏联，很多教材都要新编，又由于经过思想改造运动，许多教师们把原来学来的一套否定了，而新的体系没有建立，有些青黄不接。所以突击俄文，翻译讲义，显得很忙。这两年来，是不是学习苏联已经学通了呢？是不是新的学术体系已经建立了呢？我想并不都是如此。但是上课的困难似乎确是比较少了。那是因为一方面教师已有所提高，另一方面讲义也编出了一套，上堂照本宣读，问题已不大。但是到了去年，却又发生了新的情况，反教条主义的结果，对教师提出了新的要求。要培养能独立思考的学生，老师自己先得要独立思考一番。过去和教本不同的说法，不论自己信与不信，可以闭口不谈，现在得讲讲各家的异同，那就免不了要批判批判，如果自己没有钻研过，道理也就说不明白。过去可以口头上复述一些心里不太同意的理论，现在心口不一致，连自圆其说都有难处了。过去可以根据权威对那些自己连原书都没有见过的异说，跟着大加驳斥，现在别人一追问就会露马脚了。总之，现在没有一点真才实学，教书这个行道是不容易搞了。反教条主义能提高教学质量的道理在此，引起教师们业务上的紧张的道理也在此。
    我所接触到的许多朋友们，对反教条主义是拥护的，对自己提高业务的要求也是积极的，他们要求帮助也是真实的。要“一间房、二本书”静静地做做功课就是指这个。说得具体一些，他们要求开展科学研究，要有机会出席学术性的会议，甚至要脱离生产进修一个时期，和出国留学，等等。这种要求是好的，应当说是可贵的。
    现在让我们看看实际情况，帮助教师们提高业务的科学研究开展得怎样了呢？有的学校好些，有的学校差些，总的说来，我认为并没有满足教师们的要求。
    如果研究一下科学研究工作开展得不够令人满意的情况，关键问题是什么呢？是不是工作条件不好呢？我看并不如此。教师们工作条件在过去半年中是有很大改善的。首先说过去吵得最凶的时间问题。自从规定六分之五的业务时间之后，各地高等学校想了很多办法来贯彻，效果是不坏的。去年上半年，北京的高等学校里大约已有四分之三的教师得到了保证。8月里我到昆明，听说云南大学里只有不到五分之一的教师还不能保证业务时间。今年年初我知道有些学校业务时间得不到保证的教师比例已降到十分之一以下。这个问题虽则不能说全部解决，而且像李达先生在新年愿望中所提到的情况还是存在，这些业务时间得不到保证的人又多是有能力搞科学研究的，但是一般说来时间问题已不是开展科学研究的主要障碍了。其次，图书、资料、仪器、设备的条件怎样呢？这些条件各地、各校是不平衡的。过去一年中，各校购置图书一般都有增加，现在的问题主要不是书少，而是编目慢、流通难，分配还不够合理。仪器方面在生产、供应、修配、使用上问题还多，特别是内地和边区的学校困难不少。但过去一年中，我们在这些方面的工作还是做得不少的。除了特别的专题外，一般还没有发生有人因为这些方面的条件缺乏而不能进行科学研究的。
    那么现在高等学校里的教师们在开展科学研究上最重要的问题是什么呢？我认为是具体领导不够。在这半年的旅行中，我看到：凡是加强了对教师们科学研究工作的领导，这些学校里的教师们也就安心工作，业务有提高，学生也满意；凡是放松了这方面领导的，教师们彷徨苦闷，情绪也多。这种区别是可以理解的。教师们当前积极要求提高业务，一有奔头就心安理得。如果积极性起来了，有了要求，不能满足，看不到用力的方向，心就乱了。
    全国各高等学校里科学研究工作开展得怎样，我不清楚，但是我知道没有把科学研究工作认真领导起来的学校还是不少的。有些学校把“向科学进军”当运动来搞，做了号召性的动员报告之后，发表格要教师们填题目，造计划，甚至过了一个时候就伸手要成果。在高等学校里究竟应当搞些什么研究？科学研究和教学怎样结合？各科抓些什么问题？教师之间又怎样组织起来，分工合作，互相帮助？进行研究时要什么具体条件？工作中遇到了困难怎样帮助克服？怎样组织讨论来提高学术思想？——这一系列的问题显然不是任何一个教师能单独解决的。在这些问题上都须要具体领导。如果学校领导上不深入实际，依靠科学研究上有经验的教师，逐步地跟着工作的发展，解决这些问题，教师们尽管主观上怎样积极，科学研究工作不是开展不起来，就是搞得有些混乱。我就遇到过已经填过几次科学研究计划表的朋友，见了我还是说科学研究方向不明，题目难找，甚至有些连自己在表上填过些什么都不大清楚了。对于这些朋友，向科学进军真像一阵风，只“吹皱了一池春水。”另外还有些朋友，急于赶世界水平，对实际条件考虑不够，一动手首先和已有的教学任务碰了头，时间冲突，精力兼顾不来，发生了矛盾。我又注意到有一些学校领导上对第一种情况倒并不焦急，按兵不动，但求完得成当前教学任务就满意了，而且科学研究表格已汇报了上级，交了卷了。他们对于第二种情况却相当敏感，惟恐教学任务受到影响。他们不去分析怎么会发生这种情况的，更少自觉到这正是缺乏具体领导的结果；反而大叫教学和科学研究有矛盾，教师们名利心重，轻教重研。好像为按兵不动，填表了事，找到了正当理由。这种叫喊对教师们的积极性是不利的。上推下拉，进退两难，他们思想上怎能不混乱，情绪上怎能不受波动？高等学校里怎样开展科学研究的问题进一步明确一下是必要的。如果真的在高等学校里科学研究和教学有矛盾，不能放手开展科学研究，也得拿出个提高教师们业务水平的具体办法来。我对这个问题没有深入研究，但总觉得解决的办法，不是在冻结科学研究、保证教学，而是在加强对科学研究的具体领导，密切和教学的结合。高等学校里科学研究搞得太多了还是太少了？我想这个问题是值得检查一下的。
    知识分子提高业务的积极要求反映了他们已自觉到业务水平不足以适应社会主义建设急速发展的需要。这种自觉表示了他们的政治觉悟已有了提高，是过去几年思想改造和学习的效果。如果他们还是自认为是社会主义事业的旁观者，他们为什么要不到午夜不上床的自苦如此呢？我想强调知识分子搞科学研究是为名利双收，是个人打算是不好的，因为和事实不符。
    接着想谈谈百家争鸣。
    百家争鸣实实在在地打中了许多知识分子的心，太好了。知识分子的思想改造是从立场这一关改起的。划清敌我似乎还比较容易些，一到观点、方法，就发生唯心和唯物的问题，似乎就不简单了。比如说，拥护党、政府，爱国家、人民，对知识分子来说是容易搞得通的，但是要批判资产阶级唯心主义思想体系，就有不少人弄不大清楚什么是唯物的，什么是唯心的那一套。唯物和唯心的界线弄不大清楚，只有简单地划一下，说凡是资产阶级国家里讲的学术都是唯心的，凡是社会主义国家里讲的学术都是唯物的。如果这条线划对了，事情是容易办些。英美的书本占书架，当废纸卖掉；俄文来不及学，就买翻译的小册子来读。写文章、上讲堂多引几句引经据典的话，找几个英美学者骂上一番。这些都好办，而且很多人是这样办了。但是学习了一些辩证唯物主义之后，逐步会觉得这样简单的划法，似乎是很成问题的，觉得有一点像小孩子看草台戏，剧情看不懂，就看白脸还是红脸，白脸挨打了就叫好。他们逐步明白过去那样以为那些人说的话一定是唯物的，那些人说的话一定是唯心的想法不很对头的。他们开始要求从学术思想本身来辨别唯心还是唯物。我想这应当可以说是学习上进了一步，但是这步一进，问题却多了，心情也跟着复杂起来了。他们很希望把官司打清楚，自己的学术思想里究竟哪些是唯物的，哪些是唯心的。但是在百家争鸣的方针提出之前，却还没有这个条件。
    积极的东西搞得不好会变成消极的东西。要求搞清楚唯物唯心的界线应当肯定是积极的，但是如果条件不具备，这种要求不能满足，别人还是红脸白脸地来对待他，他心里就会不服气，会产生情绪。我体会到学习苏联这个问题上就有这种情况。最初确是有人反对学习苏联，本质上是立场问题。但是最近又出现一些对学习苏联的态度不满的情绪，如果不加分析，会觉得立场又不稳了，其实性质是和过去不同的。在过去一段时期里确有一些地方把学习苏联简单化了。有些苏联传来的东西不一定是正确的，有些人提出了怀疑或不同意见，反而受到批评，于是搞出了情绪。这些情绪并不是从立场问题上发生的。但一有情绪，消极因素也跟着滋长，那就不好了。
    百家争鸣恰好解决当前知识分子思想发展上发生出来的这些问题。据我的了解，百家争鸣就是通过自由讨论来明确是非，即是知识分子进一步的思想改造，在观点、方法上更进一步的接受辩证唯物主义。现在绝大多数知识分子是有接受辩证唯物主义的要求的。他们希望具体地弄清哪些是唯物的，哪些是唯心的，唯心的为什么不对，口服心服地在思想上进入工人阶级。他们欢迎百家争鸣，因为百家争鸣可以保障不会冤屈任何一点正确的东西，而且给任何一点可以长成为正确的东西充分发展的条件。这样，可以防止积极转化为消极，而使知识分子的潜力充分发挥出来。
      “百家争鸣”的方针贯彻得怎样了呢？和“向科学进军”来比较似乎又差一些。先从知识分子方面来说：他们对百家争鸣是热心的；心里热，嘴却还是很紧，最好是别人争，自己听。要自己出头，那还得瞧瞧，等一等再说，不为天下先。依我接触到的范围来说，不肯敞开暴露思想的人还是占多数。这一年来，情况是有些好转，在一定场合之下，有些人是肯吐露些知心话了，但是还是相当腼腆的。向科学进军可以关起门来进，而百家争鸣就得抛头露面来鸣，腼腆了就鸣不成。
    究竟顾虑些什么呢？对百家争鸣的方针不明白的人当然还有，怕是个圈套，搜集些思想情况，等又来个运动时可以好好整一整。这种人不能说太多。比较更多些的是怕出丑。不说话，抱了书本上堂念，肚子里究竟有多少货，别人莫测高深。抛头露面，那就会显原形。说穿了这里还有个“面子问题”。面子问题并不是简单的。我记得有一次座谈会上有一位朋友说得很生动，他说，我不是怕挨批评，我们以前还不是大家有被批评的，学术论战还是搞过，现在可挨不得，因为一有人说自己有了唯心主义，明天上课学生的脸色就不同，自己脚也软了。面子是很现实的东西。带上一个“落后分子”的帽子，就会被打入冷宫，一直会影响到物质基础，因为这是“德”，评薪评级，进修出国，甚至谈恋爱，找爱人都会受到影响。这个风气现在是正在转变中，但是积重难返，牵涉的面广，也不是一下就转得过来的。“明哲保身”“不吃眼前亏”的思想还没有全消的知识分子，想到了不鸣无妨，鸣了说不定会自讨麻烦，结果是何必开口。
    另一方面是具体领导知识分子工作的人对于百家争鸣的方针是不是都搞通了呢？也不全是通的。有些是一上来就有的担心。“中央定的方针当然是正确的，但是我们这里具体情况还没有条件。”接着有些人想把这个方针圈个范围：先圈在学术里，再圈在教学之外，这样一来就可以不出乱子了。等到鸣了起来，闻到一些唯心主义的气味，就有人打起警钟：“唯心主义泛滥了”，
  “资产阶级的思想又冒头了”。大有好容易把妖魔镇住了，这石碣一揭开，又会冲出来，捣乱人间的样子。对这方针抗拒的人固然不算多，但是对这方针不太热心，等着瞧瞧再说的人似乎并不少。
      “草色遥看近却无”——这原是早春天气应有的风光。
    知识分子的早春天气意味着他们的积极性是动起来了，特别表现在提高业务的要求上，但是消极因素还是很多的。他们对百家争鸣还是顾虑重重，不敢鸣，不敢争；至于和实际政治关系比较密切的问题上，大多更是守口如瓶，有点事不关己，高高挂起的神气。比如说：波匈事件发生时，我正在边区旅行，没有直接听到当时高级知识分子的反映，但是去年年底回到城市里和朋友们谈起了这些事，我的印象是这样大的事情在高级知识分子中引起的波动却是不大的。一方面这是好的，说明我们的这些知识分子立场是稳的；但另一方面，如果仔细了解一下，可以看到他们并不是思想上是非辨别得很清楚所以很稳，而是没有深刻地动过脑筋，古井没有生波，不很关心。
    我想，对世界的和国家的大事不很关心可能是当前许多高级知识分子的一般情况。这种情况当然不是新发生的，由来已久。有一次我和几个朋友一同聊天，谈起了为什么很多朋友不很关心政治。有一位朋友说得很有意思。他说大概有四个原因：第一是有一种相当普遍的想法，认为国家大事自有贤能，自己可以不必操心。大家的确相信共产党的领导是错不到那里去的，很放心，只要好好跟共产党走，把自己岗位工作做好了，就是了。其次是很多人对自己缺乏信心，不必等别人批评，自己常常会问问自己是不是旧思想又在冒头，所以对于世界大事或是国家大事自己没有个看法和主张，等等人民日报发表了社论才动脑筋。第三，对世界大势，自觉很孤陋寡闻，不要说别的，连很多外国人的名字说起来都觉得绕口。情况不熟悉，要动脑筋也没有资材。第四，年来养成了没有布置就不学习的懒汉习惯。我们曾经想替这些思想配个帽子，但是配来配去头寸都不很合。说信任党、接受领导不对么？当然不可以这样说。但是怎么会信任得成了依赖了呢？虚心些也是好的，但是怎么搞得没有了主张了呢？不论怎样，总的看来，对国家的事情关心不够总是消极性的东西。
    为什么会发生这些思想情况的呢？这些思想情况又说明些什么呢？我们在一起聊天的朋友，自认水平不够，说不清楚。我们似乎觉得这里是不是反映着这些知识分子觉得问不问国事对国家对自己都没有什么区别呢？自己有个主张和没有个主张又有什么关系呢？是不是他们觉得积极来提出意见似乎也没有什么必要，别人也不见得考虑，不赘一词，国家的事还是办得很好呢？如果真是这样想法，是不是说这些知识分子的政治积极性还没有很好发挥呢？那么怎样能把他们在这方面的积极性发挥出来呢？——说到了这些问题，我想可能会超过我这篇杂文的范围。那是春暖花开时节的事了。
