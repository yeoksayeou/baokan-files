Qinghai's Minority Education Has Developed Greatly
Sangre Gyatso's Speech

I fully agree with the reports made by Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong, and I am willing to implement them after the meeting.

Qinghai is a multi-ethnic region. For many years, it has suffered from extremely cruel oppression and plundering by the reactionary ruling class, resulting in extreme poverty and backwardness in politics, economy, and culture, especially for ethnic minorities in pastoral areas, this phenomenon is even more serious. After liberation, thanks to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the People's Government, and under the brilliant illumination of the equal and united ethnic policy, the political and ideological consciousness of the people of all ethnic groups has been raised, and their lives have been improved. As a result, people of all ethnic minorities have an urgent need to learn culture, which undoubtedly promoted the rapid development of ethnic education. Now, I would like to express my personal opinions on ethnic minority education in Qinghai, especially on cultural education in pastoral areas: First, Main Achievements

Primary schools and normal schools have increased significantly; primary school teachers are being vigorously trained; primary school textbooks are now entirely in Tibetan.

1.  Due to the correct leadership of the Party and government, the enthusiastic help of Han cadres, and the strong support of many public figures from ethnic minorities, the cultural and educational work of ethnic minorities in our province has made considerable progress. At present, there are 428 special ethnic primary schools with 43,467 students. Last year, the Ethnic Public School was changed to the Ethnic Institute, with 565 students. The original Provincial Ethnic Teacher Training Class was changed to Ethnic Normal School, with 600 teachers in training.

2.  Before liberation, the pastoral areas were full of miserable scenes of hunger and cold, and displaced people. How could we talk about learning culture! Since 1951, when ethnic primary schools began to be established in pastoral areas, children in pastoral areas, like flowers in spring, have been thriving under the sunshine. According to statistics in September last year, there were a total of 173 primary schools in pastoral areas throughout the province, with 11,449 students. At the same time, Party and League organizations in schools are constantly developing, making these spring flowers bloom brightly and develop in an all-round way.

3.  There are many difficulties in carrying out cultural and educational work for ethnic minorities in pastoral areas. In particular, the lack of suitable teachers is a major issue. In order to meet the needs of future work, we changed the Ethnic Teacher Training Class to the Provincial Ethnic Normal School last year; and built an ethnic normal school in each of the six autonomous prefectures, preparing to enroll students this year. After two or three years, the problem of teachers for ethnic primary schools in pastoral areas can be solved.

4.  In order to implement the teaching policy of focusing on the language and writing of ethnic minorities, the Provincial Department of Education, after several years of hard work, translated all primary school textbooks into Tibetan last September, which not only met the needs of our province, but also served as teaching materials and references in some provinces. Last year, more than 330,000 copies were distributed, and this year it is expected to distribute 450,000 copies, which will exceed the total number of copies distributed in previous years. Compilation of teaching materials for junior high schools and junior normal schools has also begun.

What I have reported is indeed insignificant in the interior. But in our pastoral areas, it is really not easy. This is also the biggest feature of the concrete implementation of the policies of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, and we should affirm it. Second, Several Experiences

It is necessary to do a good job of publicity and education for parents and headmen in advance; conscientiously implement the teaching policy of focusing on the language and writing of ethnic minorities; and adopt different forms of school organization according to local conditions.

1.  In ethnic minority areas, to carry out cultural and educational work, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the Party's ethnic policy and do a good job of publicity and education. In recent years, because we have paid enough attention to this issue, the cultural and educational work in pastoral areas has achieved the above results. The specific method is to start with publicity and education, and use different methods to persuade and educate different objects, so that our teaching policies and policies can be deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. For upper-level people, we can adopt methods such as meetings, visits, and individual talks to get their ideas across. As long as these people take action, the teaching work in pastoral areas will have the support of the society. Now, almost all the heads in pastoral areas send their children to school for training, so the pastoral people have eliminated unnecessary concerns, and the number of children going to school is increasing day by day. It is also impossible to ignore carrying out necessary publicity and education for the parents of children, and maintaining regular contact with them. It is necessary to deeply understand that the remnants left by the reactionaries in this regard are very deep. Many parents have various concerns before their children enter school, and even after they enter school, some are still very worried. In view of this ideology and social situation, we must work hard on social publicity and education. For students who have already enrolled, we should use their ethnic language and examples that they can fully understand to talk more about ethnic policies, so that their political thinking can be improved accordingly, so as to achieve one for one, consolidate one; receive a batch, consolidate a batch, rather go slower, not suitable for simply seeking quantity and ignoring consolidation work.

2.  Conscientiously implementing the teaching policy of focusing on the language and writing of ethnic minorities and using ethnic language textbooks is the key to running ethnic primary schools in pastoral areas well. I deeply realize that this policy is very correct. In the early days of running schools in pastoral areas, we only taught students one lesson in their ethnic language, without adding other subjects. In Tibetan areas, Tibetan is spoken and Tibetan is taught, and in Mongolian areas, Mongolian is spoken and Mongolian is taught. When hiring teachers, we must consult with local heads and people, and hire whoever they like. We should not force the appointment of people they do not like, otherwise it will cause a lot of trouble and affect the progress of the work. The above is the issue of concrete implementation of ethnic policies and democratic school management in teaching work that cannot be ignored.

The teaching work in pastoral areas, like other construction work throughout the country, is constantly developing, and has not remained at the level of just starting up. Now, most primary schools in pastoral areas have added subjects such as arithmetic, singing, physical education, and drawing. The level of only teaching language subjects has been broken through. This new situation has brought us many new problems, such as whether the content of various primary school textbooks in pastoral areas is the same as that of general primary schools; the requirements for the progress of teaching cannot be exactly the same as those of schools in agricultural areas. In addition, based on the teaching policy of focusing on the language and writing of ethnic minorities, it is very necessary to appropriately add Chinese in areas where conditions permit, but it should not be rushed. It should be active and yet steady.

3.  In establishing schools, it is necessary to adopt different forms of school organization according to the actual conditions and characteristics of each ethnic group and tribe, and with the consent of local public leaders and representatives and the support of the people of all ethnic groups. In the state, county, and township government locations, or small agricultural areas, fixed adobe primary schools can be established. Among those nomads who cannot live in a fixed place, mobile tent primary schools can be established along with the tribes, which can take care of the living conditions of ethnic tribes and facilitate children's schooling. But in the future, we will try our best to gradually fix all mobile schools according to specific circumstances. Other factors, such as doing a good job in all necessary equipment for primary schools in pastoral areas as much as possible; providing appropriate scholarships to students from poor pastoral families; encouraging teachers in many ways, and obtaining the attention and support of local party and government, are also important factors in running primary schools in pastoral areas well, and we should strengthen this work in the future. Third, Problems and Opinions

There is a severe shortage of people who understand both Chinese and Tibetan, making it very difficult to compile junior high school textbooks; it is hoped that the scholarships for herdsmen will be appropriately increased.

Although our achievements are not small, there are still some problems and shortcomings. The main ones are that the summary of work experience is not enough, the leading organs lack specific guidance and inspection, the quality of teachers is not high, the school equipment is not complete, the printing conditions are not available, and the supply of teaching materials is not timely. This inevitably affects the quality of teaching, which is a problem that we will pay special attention to solving in our future work.

My opinions are: (1) The Provincial Department of Education has started the compilation of junior high school and junior normal school textbooks, but due to insufficient manpower and a severe shortage of talents who understand both Chinese and Tibetan, it has encountered many insurmountable difficulties. Please give specific guidance and assistance from relevant central departments so as to jointly and quickly complete this new work.

(2) Thanks to the deep concern and care of the Party and the People's Government for the pastoral areas, scholarships have been issued to more than 5,000 children of poor herdsmen, but because the economic foundation of the pastoral areas is weak, the herdsmen still have the requirement to subsidize scholarships. Can the scholarships be appropriately increased to encourage their enthusiasm for schooling. If there are any incorrect places in the above opinions, please correct them.

    青海少数民族教育已有很大发展
    桑热嘉措的发言
    我完全同意周总理、李富春副总理、陈叔通副主席给我们所作的各项报告，并愿在会后贯彻执行。
    青海是一个多民族地区，多年来受着反动统治阶级极其残酷的压榨和掠夺，形成政治、经济、文化各方面极端贫困和落后状态，特别是牧业区的少数民族，这种现象更为严重。解放后，由于中国共产党、毛主席和人民政府的正确领导，以及在平等团结的民族政策光辉照耀下，各族人民政治思想觉悟提高了，生活得到了改善，因而各少数民族人民就有了迫切学文化的要求，无疑的也就促进了民族教育事业的迅速发展。现在我就青海少数民族教育，特别是牧业区民族文化教育工作，发表个人的意见：一、主要成绩
    小学和师范学校有显著增加；小学师资正在大力培养；小学课本已全部使用藏文。
    1、由于党政正确领导，汉族干部的热诚帮助，少数民族中许多公众领袖人物的大力支持，我省少数民族文教工作有了长足的进展，目前已有民族专设小学四二八处，学生四万三千四百六十七名。去年将民族公学改为民族学院，有学生五百六十五名。原省民族师资训练班，改为民族师范，培养中的师资学生有六百名。
    2、解放前牧业区到处是啼饥号寒，流离失所的悲惨景象，哪里还谈得上学文化的事呢！从1951年在牧业区开始创办了民族小学，牧业区的儿童们，像春天的花朵一样，在太阳光下，欣欣向荣。据去年9月份的统计，全省牧业区共有一百七十三处小学，学生一万一千四百四十九名。同时在学校里的党团组织，不断的得到发展，使这些春天的花朵，鲜艳的开放，全面的发展。
    3、在牧业区里开展少数民族文化教育工作，所遇到的困难是很多的，尤其缺乏合适的师资问题，是一件大事。我们为了适应今后工作的需要，去年已将民族师资训练班改为省民族师范学校；并在六个自治州内，各建民族师范一所，准备在今年招生，经两三年后，就可以解决牧业区民族小学师资问题。
    4、为了贯彻以本民族语言文字为主的教学方针，省教育厅经几年来的最大努力于去年9月份已将小学课本，全部用藏文译成，不但供应了本省的需要，而且有的省也作了教材和参考，去年共发行三十三万多册，今年预计能发行四十五万册，将要超过以往数年的发行总数。初中、初师教材，也开始着手编译。
    我所报导的这些事，在内地来讲，的确是微不足道。但是在我们牧业区来说，实在是很不容易的，这也是中国共产党、人民政府各项政策具体贯彻的最大特征，我们应该肯定下来。二、几点体会
    要事先对家长和头人做好宣传教育；认真贯彻以本民族语言文字为主的教学方针；因地制宜，采取不同的学校组织形式。
    1、在少数民族地区，开展文化教育工作，首先要认真贯彻党的民族政策，做好宣传教育工作。几年来由于我们足够的重视了这个问题，因而牧业区的文化教育工作，才获得了以上的一些成绩。具体的办法，就要先从宣传教育着手，用不同的方法，对不同的对象，进行说服教育。使我们的教学方针政策深入人心。对上层人士可采取开会、参观及个别交谈等方式打通他们的思想，只要这些人动起来，那么牧业区的教学工作，就有了社会上支持的力量。现在牧区的头目人中，差不多都把自己的子女送到学校里来培养，这样牧区群众也就消除了不必要的顾虑，陆续上学的儿童，日益增多。对儿童的家长进行必要的宣传教育，经常保持和他们的连系，也是不能忽视的。需要深刻了解到反动派在这方面留下的遗毒是很深的，很多家长，在他们的子弟没有入学之前，甚至入学之后，都存在着各式各样的疑虑，有的还很不放心。针对这种思想和社会情况，我们必须在社会宣传教育工作上下一番苦工。对已入学的学生应该用本民族的语言，通过他们能完全理解的事例，多讲民族政策，使他们的政治思想相应的得到提高，以达到收一个，巩固一个；收一批，巩固一批，宁可走慢一些，不宜单求数量而忽视巩固工作。
    2、认真贯彻以本民族语言文字为主的教学方针，采用本民族的语文教材，是办好牧区少数民族小学的关键问题。我深深体会到这个方针政策是非常正确的，在办牧区学校的初期，我们向学生只教本民族文字的语文一课，不加其他课目。藏族地区上藏文说藏话，蒙古族地区上蒙文说蒙古话。聘请教员，一定和当地头目人及群众商量，他们喜欢谁就请谁，他们不喜欢的人我们不要勉强聘任，否则增加很多麻烦，影响工作的进展。以上是在教学工作中具体贯彻民族政策和民主办学的问题不可忽视的。
    牧业区的教学工作，和全国各地的其他建设工作一样是不断发展着的，并没有停留在刚创办的水平上，现在大多数牧区小学里，添授了算术、唱歌、体育图画等科目，只上语文科的水平线已经突破了，这个新形势，给我们提出了许多新的问题，比如牧业区各种小学课本内容是否和一般小学的内容一样；教学进度的要求和农业区的学校不可能完全一致。另外应本着以本民族语言文字为主的教学方针，在有条件地区适当的加以汉语汉文是非常必要的，但不宜操之过急，应该是积极的而又是稳步的。
    3、在建立学校工作上，必须根据各民族各部落的实际情况和特点，并取得当地公众领袖代表人物的同意下，和各族群众的支持下，可采取不同的学校组织形式，在州、县、乡政权所在地，或小块农业区，可设立固定的土房小学，在那些居住不能固定的牧民中，可设立随着部落流动的帐房小学，这样既能照顾到民族部落的生活条件，又能便利儿童的上学。但我们今后尽可能把所有的流动学校，按具体情况，逐步固定起来。其他如尽可能办好牧业区小学的各项必要的设备；给贫苦牧民的上学子弟予以适当的助学金；从多方面鼓励教员，并得到当地党政的重视和支持等，也是办好牧区小学的重要因素，今后应该加强这方面的工作。三、问题和意见
    懂得汉藏两种文字的人奇缺，编译初中课本困难很大；希望把牧民助学金适当增加。
    虽然我们的成绩是不小，但还存在着一些问题和缺点，主要的是对工作经验总结不够，领导机关缺乏具体的指导与检查，教员质量不高，学校设备不够完整，印刷条件不具备，教材供应不及时等问题，这就不可避免的影响了教学质量，这是我们今后工作中特别注重解决的问题。
    我的意见是：（1）本省教育厅已开始了初中、初师课本的编译工作，但因人力不足，懂得汉藏两种文字的人材奇缺，遇到了很多难以克服的困难，请中央有关部门予以具体的指导与协助，以便共同迅速的完成这项新的工作。
    （2）由于党和人民政府对牧业区的深切关怀与照顾，给贫苦牧民的五千多子弟，发了助学金，但因牧区经济基础薄弱，牧民尚有补助助学金的要求，可否把助学金予以适当的增加，以鼓励其上学情绪。以上意见，有不对的地方，请各位指正。
