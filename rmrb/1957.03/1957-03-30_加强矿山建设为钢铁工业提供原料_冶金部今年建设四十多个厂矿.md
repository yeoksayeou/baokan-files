Xinhua News Agency, 28th. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry is strengthening mine construction for the steel industry, planning to newly build and continue building thirty mines and twelve iron ore concentration and sintering plants this year.

Among the projects being built by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry this year, fifteen are iron ore mines. These iron ore mines will be completed one after another in the next few years, and this year, production equipment with an annual output of 7.9 million tons of iron ore will be put into production successively. The remaining projects are manganese ore and non-metallic ore projects; the products of these mines are important raw materials for the development of the steel industry, of which, in addition to some ores used as flux for iron smelting, most are used to manufacture refractory materials.

The growth rate of investment in iron ore and non-metallic ore construction by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry this year exceeds the growth rate of any of the previous years; it also greatly exceeds the growth rate of investment in iron smelting, steelmaking, and rolling steel projects this year.

The production plan of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry this year shows that in steel production, iron smelting capacity is greater than ore mining capacity, and steelmaking capacity is greater than iron smelting capacity. Therefore, strengthening mine construction has become the key to increasing steel production this year and in the next few years.

In order to increase steel production this year, the Ministry has decided to recover 200,000 tons of ore from the stripping of intermixed ore and waste rock during the construction of the Daye Iron Mine, which belongs to the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation. This will create conditions for increasing the production of nearly 100,000 tons of pig iron.

　　加强矿山建设为钢铁工业提供原料
　　冶金部今年建设四十多个厂矿
    新华社28日讯  冶金工业部加强钢铁工业的矿山建设，今年计划新建和续建三十个矿山和十二个铁矿精选厂及烧结厂。
    冶金工业部今年建设的这些工程中，有十五个是铁矿。这些铁矿将在今后几年内先后建成，今年将有年产七百九十万吨铁矿石的生产设备陆续投入生产。其余的工程是锰矿和非金属矿工程；这些矿的产品是发展钢铁工业的重要原料，其中除一些为炼铁作熔剂的矿石外，大部分是用来制造耐火材料的。
    今年冶金工业部建设的铁矿和非金属矿的投资增长速度，超过前几年任何一年的增长速度；也大大超过今年炼铁、炼钢和轧钢工程投资的增长速度。
    冶金工业部今年的生产计划表明，钢铁工业生产中炼铁能力大于矿石开采能力，炼钢能力大于炼铁能力。因此加强矿山建设，就成了今年和今后几年增产钢铁的关键。
    为了今年增产钢铁，这个部决定在建设武汉钢铁公司所属的大冶铁矿过程中，从剥离铁矿上面的夹有矿石的杂石中回收二十万吨矿石。这样就可以为增产近十万吨生铁创造条件。
