Bangda Yangbi Speaks:
The Tibetan People Uphold the Seventeen-Point Agreement

I fully endorse Chairman Mao's speech and Premier Zhou's friendly visit report. These two reports are of great educational significance to me. I guarantee to convey them in detail upon my return to Tibet.

I would now like to briefly report to the assembly on the situation in Tibet: Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, Tibet has undergone fundamental changes in politics, economy, culture, and health in recent years. Following the opening of the Qinghai-Tibet and Sichuan-Tibet Highways, internal Tibetan highways from Lhasa to Shigatse, to Gyantse, and to Yatung have also been successfully constructed. The highway from Heihe to Dogetou has been surveyed and completed. In addition, some highways in Shannan and other areas have been built, and others are under construction. The airport near Lhasa has been completed. Through aviation and highways, the political and economic ties between Tibet and the interior of the motherland have become closer. Primary and secondary schools have been established in various parts of Tibet, with free admission and a set of clothing issued to each student every winter and summer. Students from impoverished families also receive living allowances. The preparatory committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region is extensively training cadres at all levels, expanding cadre schools, and training various types of Tibetan cadres. Trainees continue to receive their salaries. Medical institutions have been established in certain central areas, providing free medical care and alleviating the suffering of the Tibetan people. The Tibet Branch of the People's Bank of China and the Tibet General Trading Company, the former to facilitate business operations for people in industry and commerce by opening silver dollar exchange services, and the latter to transport supplies from the interior to meet market needs, have established new trade relations, greatly meeting the people's need for daily necessities.

What is particularly worth mentioning is that after the establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region last April, its subordinate divisions, sections, and agency-level offices were successively established. On November 8th of last year, the Preparatory Committee for the Political Consultative Conference was also established, bringing the work in Tibet to a new stage. Under the wise and correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, and under the direct leadership of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, everyone is working very hard for the increasing development and progress of work in Tibet.

In order to consolidate and develop the unity between the Han and Tibetan nationalities, we Tibetan people only know to abide by the Seventeen-Point Agreement, and do not consider anything else. Imperialist elements say that the Dalai Lama has no freedom, but isn't the fact that the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni went to India this time sufficient proof that they have complete freedom? The attempts of imperialist elements who dislike revolutionary elements are doomed to failure.

Regarding the issue of reform in Tibet: In the speeches of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni at the founding meeting of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, it was mentioned that the motherland is moving towards socialism, Tibet must undergo reform, and the reform in Tibet depends on whether the conditions are ripe and must be carried out gradually, starting with pilot projects. Last year, during the reform process in the Tibetan areas of Sichuan and Dege and other places on the east bank of the Jinsha River, although the central government's policies were not wrong, cadres made mistakes in implementing the policies, and the reform in some areas did not go well, causing disturbances in all directions. Many rich and poor people on the east bank of the Jinsha River fled to the west bank, and some fled to Lhasa, causing panic and doubt among the Tibetan people about reform. Now, Chairman Mao has instructed that reforms will not be carried out during the Second Five-Year Plan period, and whether they will be carried out during the Third Five-Year Plan period will depend on the people's willingness. Work in Tibet will be carried out in accordance with the Seventeen-Point Agreement, thus eliminating the panic and doubt of the Tibetan people. The central government has sent a special delegation to visit the Tibetan areas of Sichuan, repair damaged temples, and resettle affected people. In areas where peaceful reform has been carried out well, the people's ideological awareness has been raised.

The cultural level of the Tibetan people is very low and relatively backward. Now there are primary and secondary schools, which is very good. We hope that in the future, universities will be further established in this vast area to train more Tibetan cadres. In the national plan for new railway construction during the Second Five-Year Plan, it has been decided to complete the construction of the Qinghai-Qaidam Railway. We hope that this railway will continue to be extended to Tibet, which will definitely be of great benefit to the lives of the Tibetan people. (Picture attached)

### 邦达养璧说　西藏人民维护十七项协议

　　邦达养璧说
　　西藏人民维护十七项协议
    我完全拥护毛主席的讲话和周总理的友好访问报告，这两个报告对我有很大的教育意义。我保证回藏后作详尽的传达。
    我现在把西藏的一些情况简单地向大会报告一下：西藏地区在毛主席、中央人民政府的领导下，几年来政治、经济、文化、卫生等方面都发生了根本的变化，继青藏、康藏二条公路通车以后，西藏内部的从拉萨到日喀则，到江孜，到亚东的公路也已修筑成功，从黑河到多格头的公路已经测量完竣。此外山南等地的公路有的已经筑成，有的正在修筑。拉萨附近的飞机场已经修筑完成，通过航空和公路，西藏与祖国内地间的政治、经济上的联系更加密切了。在西藏各地设立了中小学校，不但免费入学，每年冬夏季还给每个学生各发一套服装，对家境贫寒的学生还有生活补助费用。西藏自治区筹备委员会的各级干部进行大量培养，扩建干部学校，训练藏族各类干部，受训的干部工资待遇照发。在某些中心地区建立医疗机构，免费医疗，解除了藏族人民的疾病痛苦。中国人民银行西藏分行、西藏贸易总公司两机构，前者为了工商界人士经营方便，开放银元兑换业务，后者经内地运入物资供应市场需要，建立了新的贸易关系，这样就大大满足了人民对日用物品的需要。
    特别值得提出的是，去年4月间西藏自治区筹备委员会成立之后，随后会下所属的各处、科以及机巧级办事处也相继成立，去年11月8日又成立了政治协商会议筹备委员会，这样就使西藏的工作到达新的阶段。在毛主席、中央人民政府的英明正确领导下，在达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼的直接领导下，为了西藏地区工作的日益开展和进步，大家都非常努力。
    为了巩固和发展汉藏民族之间的团结，我们西藏人民只知道遵循十七项协议，其他任何东西概不考虑，帝国主义分子说达赖喇嘛没有自由，而事实呢，这次达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼之去印度不是充分说明他们有完全的自由吗？帝国主义分子不喜欢革命的分子的企图注定是要失败的。
    关于西藏的改革问题。在西藏自治区筹备委员会成立大会上，达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼的讲话中提到：祖国是要走向社会主义的，西藏必须进行改革，西藏的改革是要看条件成熟与否，要逐步地进行，开始先要试办。去年四川藏区以及金沙江东岸一带德格等地在改革过程中，虽然中央的政策不会有错误，但是干部在执行政策时出了偏差，有些地区的改革进行不好，因而四方惊扰，金沙江东岸贫富人家很多逃到西岸，有的逃到拉萨，因而西藏人民对改革发生了惊恐和疑虑。现在毛主席指示第二个五年计划期间不进行改革，第三个五年计划期间是否进行，要看人民的自愿，西藏工作根据十七项协议进行，这样就消除西藏人民的惊恐和疑惧。四川藏区中央特派了访问团前往访问，对破损的寺庙加以整修，对受灾的群众给以安置，和平改革进行得好的地区，人民的思想觉悟有了提高。
    西藏人民文化很低，比较落后，现在有了中小学，这是很好的，我们希望今后在这广大的地区里，再进一步建立大学，更多地培养藏族干部；第二个五年计划全国新建铁路的计划中决定完成青海—柴达木铁路的修筑，我们希望这条铁路继续延伸筑到西藏，这样对西藏人民的生活一定会有莫大的好处。（附图片）
