    The Education of the God of Wealth
    Xu Xuan Sheng
    In imperialist countries, the God of War directly serves the God of Wealth; the former is the sincere lackey of the latter. However, any sincere lackey seems to be a bit too enthusiastic about his own profession; moreover, the God of War is, after all, the God of War, inevitably with more crudeness and clumsiness; furthermore, perhaps it is due to the objective laws of social development as the Communists say, or perhaps God's blessing is not comprehensive enough; in short, the result of the Gods of War's service brings trouble to their master. Therefore, the God of Wealth must educate the Gods of War. This is the real meaning of the secret letter from the American billionaire Rockefeller to Eisenhower (the original translation of the letter can be found in the "People's Daily" on February 24).
    The God of Wealth is always realistic; therefore, this billionaire first pointed out from the facts that America's "military alliances are becoming increasingly unpopular... In the past two or three years, the policy of establishing military alliances has suffered serious setbacks." This setback, although partly "due to the aggressive diplomatic offensive launched by the Russians," is "mainly due to" the Americans' own "concept of force being too blatant and focusing too much on the military aspect." The God of War was criticized.
    Thus, the God of Wealth gave a lesson to the God of War. The topic is called "The General Line of Our Foreign Policy" and its "philosophical" foundation, "theoretical principles," and methods.
    Rockefeller first simply and clearly expounded his "philosophical" idea: "What is good for Standard Oil is good for America." Based on this "philosophy," the "theoretical principle" as a guide to action for Americans is stipulated as: there must be "a unified foreign policy using all pressures" to "create... what we hope is the establishment of a consolidated military alliance."
    Based on this "philosophy" and "theoretical principle," the "general line" of American foreign policy is defined as: "Our policy must be both ‘global’ and ‘total’; ‘global’ means to include every part of the world, and ‘total’ means to include political, psychological, economic, military and special methods, and combine these methods into a whole." What a great "general line"! But in our opinion, there seems to be nothing new here, just the old line of Japan and Hitler's Germany.
    Regarding "philosophy," "theoretical principles," and "general line," the God of War did not violate the will of the God of Wealth. The problem lies in the "methods."
    Regarding "methods," Rockefeller also put forward a basic principle, that is, the principle of America's "smart tradition": "Trade first, then the flag." This principle, expressed in modern language, is to "provide economic and technical assistance to underdeveloped countries" to "strengthen existing military arrangements and give them new vitality, thereby greatly facilitating the completion of any military tasks we may face in the future." The teacher also uses figurative language to express this principle, using "bait" to make "fish" "take the hook."
    Rockefeller also taught that it is necessary to analyze specific situations and adopt different countermeasures for different countries: first, for those "fish that have already taken the hook," such as Turkey, there is "no need for bait"; second, for neutral countries, such as Egypt, and "the most important... is India," use "economic assistance" to make them "inevitably fall into excessively large projects, thereby needing our support for a long time"; "Through this method, we can hope to steer the foreign policies of these countries in a more desirable direction"; third, for "those colonial countries that are still directly dependent on the suzerain states (naturally the suzerain states other than the United States - author)," such as Morocco, etc., it is necessary to "support the local business people who are fighting against colonial status."
    Our God of Wealth is truly cunning and sophisticated. He emphasized that these methods should be used with "flexibility," "care," "caution," and "patience." He emphasized the strategy of "giving before taking," "in the initial stage, we must limit ourselves to seeking minimal political concessions in exchange for our economic assistance," and even "in certain special circumstances... no concessions are required in return," "In this way, at a later stage, we will be able to step up the proposal of political prices and military demands." He emphasized in propaganda that those "fish" should be "informed of the selfless nature of the U.S. policy of assisting underdeveloped countries."
    There are indeed some creative things in this set of methods.
    I don't want to estimate what impact Rockefeller's lecture will have on Eisenhower and his ilk. But this is of great significance to us, it makes us more clearly understand the essence of the "general line of American foreign policy." The lackeys of imperialist countries, such as Dulles, blindly put on airs and act hypocritically, urging our vomiting; now, the master is educating the lackeys on how to be hypocritical, and the words are true.
    The people of the world, especially the people of those countries that Rockefeller mentioned as already "hooked" and not yet "hooked," will study this letter. The result of the study will be to "make future historians say: In the second decade after World War II, the freedom of the world was lost due to the U.S. budget needing to be balanced (or not balanced - author's addition)." - However, a note should be added: the God of Wealth's word "freedom" should be interpreted as "shackles."

    财神爷的教育
    徐选牲
    在帝国主义国家里，战神是直接为财神服务的；前者是后者的真诚的奴才。但是，任何真诚的奴才，似乎都有点过分热中于自己的专业的倾向；加以战神究竟是战神，不免更多一些粗暴气和笨拙气；还有，或者是共产党人所说的社会发展客观规律之故，或者是上帝保佑得不周全；总而言之，战神们服务的结果，给主子带来烦恼了。因此，财神就要对战神进行教育了。这就是美国的亿万富翁洛克菲勒给艾森豪威尔的秘密信的真正意义（原信译文见2月24日的“人民日报”）。
    财神总是现实的；所以这位亿万富翁，首先从事实出发，指出美国的“军事同盟现在正在越来越不得人心……在过去两三年中，建立军事同盟的政策遭到了严重的挫折。”这挫折，虽然一方面是“由于俄国人发动的积极的外交政策攻势”，但“主要原因”，则是美国人自己“武力的概念太露骨，过于着重军事方面”了。战神挨到了批评。
    于是，财神就给战神上课了。课题叫做“我们外交政策的总路线”及其“哲学”基础、“理论原则”和方法。
    洛克菲勒首先简单明了地阐明他的“哲学”思想道：“对美孚油公司是好的，对美国也是好的。”根据这个“哲学”，规定了作为美国人的行动指南的“理论原则”是：必须有“一项使用一切压力的统一的外交政策”以“造成……我们希望是一种巩固的军事同盟的建立”。
    以这种“哲学”和“理论原则”为依据，规定了美国外交政策的“总路线”是：“我们的政策必须既是
  ‘全球的’又是‘总体的’；所谓‘全球的’是指要包括全世界每一个部分，所谓‘总体的’是指要包括政治、心理、经济、军事和特别的方法，而把这些方法结合为一个总体”。多么伟大的“总路线”啊！但在我们看来，这里似乎并没有什么新鲜东西，只是过去日本和希特勒德国的老路线。
    关于“哲学”、“理论原则”和“总路线”，战神是没有违背财神的意志的。问题是出在“方法”方面。
    关于“方法”，洛克菲勒也提出了一个基本原则，就是美国的“聪明的传统”原则：“先贸易而后军旗”。这个原则，用现代语言来表述，是“给予不发达国家的经济和技术的援助”以“加强现有的军事安排并且赋予新的生命力，从而也会大大便利将来我们可能会面临的任何军事任务的完成”。教师又用形象化的语言，表述这个原则，是以“诱饵”使“鱼儿”来“上钩”。
    洛克菲勒还教育道，要分析具体情况，对不同的国家采取不同的对策：一，对于那些“已经上钩的鱼儿”，如土耳其，再“用不着诱饵”；二，对于中立国家，如埃及，而“最重要的……是印度”，则以“经济援助”使得它们“必定陷于过分庞大的工程上，从而长期需要我们的支持”；“通过这种办法，我们可以希望使这些国家的外交政策转向比较合乎希望的方向”；三，对“现在仍旧直接依附于宗主国 （自然是美国以外的宗主国——作者）的那些殖民地国家，如摩洛哥等等，则要“支持当地正在进行反对殖民地地位的斗争的企业界人士”。
    我们的财神爷，也真是老谋深算。他强调在运用这些方法时要“灵活”、“小心”、“谨慎”、“耐心”。他强调“将欲取之，必先予之”的策略，“在最初阶段，必须限于谋取起码的政治上的让步作为我们经济援助的交换”，甚至于“在某些特殊情况下……不需要任何让步作为回报”，“这样，在稍后的一个阶段，我们就能够加紧提出政治上的代价和军事上的要求了。”他强调在宣传上，要对那些“鱼儿”“交代美国援助不发达国家的政策的大公无私的性质方面”。
    在这一套方法里面，确乎有些创造性的东西。
    洛克菲勒的这一篇讲义，对艾森豪威尔们将会发生什么影响，我不想去估计它。但这对于我们是极有意义的，它使我们更清楚地了解美国“外交政策的总路线”的实质。帝国主义国家的奴才们，如杜勒斯之流，一味冠冕堂皇地弄虚伪，尽催我们的呕吐；现在是，主子在教育奴才怎样弄虚伪，话倒是真实的。
    全世界的人民，特别是洛克菲勒所说的那些已经“上钩”和尚未“上钩”的国家的人民，都会学习这封信的。学习的结果，则将使“将来的历史学家说：在第二次世界大战后第二个十年中，全世界的自由都由于美国预算要保持平衡（或不保持平衡——作者附加）而丧失殆尽了”。——不过，要加一点注释：财神爷的“自由”二字，应作“枷锁”解。
