Visiting Professor Gupta's Home
　　Geng Yan

　　Sincere friendship is precious. Living and studying with the Indian people far from our motherland makes us deeply appreciate the friendly feelings of Indian friends towards the Chinese people. Professor Gupta is one of our many Indian friends. He is a professor in the English Department of Allahabad University in India and a critic of Hindi literature. As Professor Gupta's students, several of us Chinese students often visit his home, and we have become acquainted with his family. He has a son who graduated from university last year and has been promoted to lecturer in the English Department. His two younger daughters are in junior high school, and his youngest daughter is in elementary school. Professor Gupta's wife is a typical kind and generous Indian woman.

　　Professor Gupta is very pleased that New China can send students to Indian universities to study Hindi. Because before India's independence, few foreigners came to India specifically to study Indian languages, except for missionaries. Whenever he meets other friends at his home or elsewhere, he always introduces us to others enthusiastically. He believes that this is one of the signs of New China's friendship towards the Indian people. Usually, to help us study, he often introduces us to relevant Hindi literary works and reviews, and sometimes lends us his own collection of books. He often says enthusiastically: "If you want to read any books, come to my small study." Later we learned that Professor Gupta does not allow his children to enter the study casually in order to keep the study clean and not affect his research work.

　　At first, we were afraid of disturbing Professor Gupta during his rest time, so we only visited occasionally. However, he liked to be with us, and he even came to our dormitory several times. This made us feel uneasy. He also guessed our concerns and said to us: "If you think like this, you would treat me as an outsider."

　　Mr. Gupta's wife loves us like her own children. Every time we go, she always asks about everything, fearing that we are not used to living here. Last summer, she was afraid that we would be bitten by mosquitoes, so she gave us her family's mosquito repellent. In winter, she also specially knitted two pairs of woolen socks for us with her little daughter. That day, when I received the woolen socks, I was so excited that I couldn't speak. I remember in Beijing, due to habit, I rarely wore woolen socks in winter; in Allahabad, India, it is possible to spend the winter by wearing a jacket, but Professor Gupta's wife knitted woolen socks for us with such meticulous care. She laughed heartily and said: "Ah! When you are away from home, especially like you children who are far away from your motherland, you must pay attention to the cold and heat!"

　　Usually, chatting at Professor Gupta's house is also an interesting thing. We talk about a wide range of topics, from Hindi literary works and writers, world affairs, to the development of Sino-Indian friendly relations, sometimes tracing back to the past, talking about history, Xuanzang, and Faxian. Professor Gupta and his eldest child are very talkative. The three little girls and their mother listen more and talk less. But sometimes Little Nina, who always likes to sit next to me, can't bear it, because these things are still a bit boring for her. She tried her best to divert the topic, and sometimes gesticulated to tell us about the interesting things that happened in her elementary school, one by one. Among the conversations of adults, there is one thing that she finds most interesting—"Go to China!" Whenever Professor Gupta and his wife talk about their wish to go to China one day, Little Nina is so happy! She kept shouting: "Daddy! Mommy! You must take me with you too!"

　　Last summer vacation, because we traveled to Kashmir, we returned to school a few days late. It happened that someone rumored that we had transferred to another place. When Nina heard the news, she tugged at her mother's clothes and cried and asked: "Why do Chinese brothers want to transfer? Is the university here not good?" According to what Mrs. Gupta told us later, Little Nina was unhappy for several days alone. The day we returned to the university, she jumped up and down with great joy. That day I asked her: "Little Nina, what are you going to do after we finish our studies and return to our country?" She was stunned for a while and said: "Take me away! Okay?"

　　India has many traditional ethnic festivals throughout the year. Indian people like to use all kinds of sweets to worship gods, and at the same time invite relatives and friends to celebrate the festival together at home. For several major festivals such as Holi (Water Splashing Festival), Dussehra (Festival of a Hundred Gods), and Diwali (Festival of Lights), Professor Gupta always calls us to go, asks Nina to put red dots of cinnabar between our eyebrows, indicating auspiciousness, and of course, we have to gather with Professor Gupta's family to eat sweets. Last year, on one occasion, we had something to do and did not go to his home to celebrate Holi. The next day, Mr. and Mrs. Gupta sent their eldest child to visit us with two boxes of sweets. They thought we were not feeling well and that was why we did not go. Their whole family had been waiting for us until night that day. Mr. and Mrs. Gupta repeatedly urged us: "You must come to our place for the New Year and festivals, and everyone will gather together happily. You will definitely miss home more when you are far away from your motherland. Treat our home as your own home." Indeed, we treat the home of Professor Gupta in India as our own home, which makes our study life far away from our motherland full of warmth and friendship.

    在古柏达教授家里作客
    耕砚
    真挚的友情是可贵的，当我们远离祖国和印度人民一起生活和学习的时候，更能切身地体会到印度朋友对于中国人民这种友好的情感。古柏达教授就是我们许多印度朋友中的一位，他是印度阿拉哈巴大学英文系的教授、印地文文学批评家之一。作为古柏达教授的学生，我们几个中国留学生常去他家作客，也就和教授一家人熟识了。他有一个男孩，去年大学毕业后已被提升为英文系的讲师，他的两个小女孩在念初中，另一个最小的女孩在念小学。古柏达教授的夫人是一位典型的慈祥而厚道的印度妇女。
    古柏达教授对于新中国能派留学生到印度的大学学习印地文，感到非常高兴。因为在印度独立以前，除了传教士以外，很少有外国人专门为学习印度语言到印度来的。每当在他家里或在其它地方碰到别的朋友的时候，他总是热情地把我们介绍给别人。他认为，这是新中国对于印度人民友好的标志之一。平时，他为了帮助我们学习，经常给我们介绍有关印地文文学作品和评论，有时还把他自己的藏书，借给我们看。他常热情地说：“你们要看什么书，到我这个小书房里来吧。”后来我们才知道，教授为了保持书房的整洁和不影响他的研究工作，他是不准自己的小孩随便进这个书房的。
    开头，我们深怕在休息时间打扰古柏达教授，只是偶尔去坐坐。但是，他喜欢同我们在一起，有几次他亲自到我们的宿舍里来了。这使我们心里不安起来。他也猜想到我们的顾虑，对我们说：“如果你们这样想，可就把我当作外人看了。”
    古柏达先生的夫人，把我们当做自己的孩子那样疼爱。我们每次去，她总要问长问短的，深怕我们在这里生活不习惯。去年夏天，她怕我们挨蚊子咬，就把家里的避蚊药水给了我们。冬天，她还特地和她的小女儿一起，替我们打了两双毛线袜子。那天，当我拿到毛线袜子的时候，真使我激动得说不出话来。记得在北京，由于习惯，我很少穿毛线袜过冬；在印度的阿拉哈巴，本来穿夹衣就可以过冬，教授夫人却这样的无微不至，给我们织起毛线袜子来。她爽朗地笑着说：“啊！出门在外，尤其像你们远远地离开自己祖国的孩子们，冷热可得要注意哪！”
      平时，在古柏达教授家里聊天，也是一件有趣的事。我们谈的题目很广，从印地文文学作品、作家，世界局势，到中印友好关系的发展，有时追溯到过去，谈到历史、玄奘、法显。古柏达教授和他的大孩子都很健谈。三个小女孩和她们的妈妈，听的时候多，谈得较少。但是有时候老喜欢坐在我旁边的小妮娜往往熬不住，因为这些对她说来却还有些枯燥乏味。她极力想把话题拉开去，有时候就指手划脚地把她在小学校所发生的有趣味的事情，一五一十地讲给我们听。大人中间的谈话，有一件使她最感趣味——“到中国去！”每当古柏达教授夫妇谈到有一天要到中国去看看的愿望的时候，小妮娜可就高兴了！她直嚷嚷：“爸爸！妈咪！可要把我也带上的噢！”
    去年暑假，因为我们到克什米尔去旅行，迟了几天回学校。刚好有人传说我们转学到别处去了。妮娜听到了这个消息，扯着妈妈的衣服哭着问：“中国哥哥为什么要转学呢？这里大学不好吗？”听古柏达夫人后来告诉我们，小妮娜一个人不高兴了好几天。当我们回到大学里的那天，她跳跳蹦蹦地高兴极了。我那天问她：“小妮娜，我们学完回国去了以后，你准备怎么办呢？”她楞住了一会儿说：“把我带去吧！好吗？”
    印度在一年之中有许多传统的民族节日。印度人民都喜欢用各式各样的甜食敬神，同时邀请亲戚朋友，到家里一起过节。像火丽节（泼水节）、突释呵罗（百神节）、蒂华利（灯节）等几个主要节日，古柏达教授总把我们叫了去，叫妮娜用朱砂在我们眉间点红痣，表示吉祥，少不了还要和古柏达教授一家，欢聚在一起吃甜食。去年有一次，我们有事没到他家里去过火丽节，第二天古柏达夫妇就差他们的大孩子提了两盒甜食来探望我们。他们以为我们身体不舒服才不去的。他们全家在那天一直等我们到晚上。古柏达教授夫妇平时再三向我们叮嘱：“过年过节，都要到我们这儿来，大伙儿热闹地聚会在一起，你们远离祖国一定会更想家。要把我们的家就看作你们自己的家一样。”的确，我们就是把印度古柏达教授的家当做自己的家一样，使我们远离祖国的学习生活充满了温暖和友情。（寄自印度阿拉哈巴大学）
