Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd, London Dispatch: The British strike movement has expanded, with a million mechanical workers beginning their strike at twelve noon today. The striking workers are demanding a 10% wage increase.

According to the decision of the leadership of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, this is the "first phase" of the mechanical workers' strike. If the workers' demands are not met, nearly three million mechanical workers will hold a general strike on April 6th. This would shut down 4,300 factories in the British aircraft manufacturing, electrical, machinery, and heavy machinery industries, whose products account for 40% of Britain's total exports.

Today's "first phase" strike affects ten regions including Liverpool, Bristol, Manchester, Glasgow, Sheffield, Southampton, and Belfast. Strike pickets have already begun patrolling these areas today.

At the same time, the strike of 200,000 British shipyard workers is still ongoing. The French General Confederation of Labor called on French shipyard workers on the 22nd to support them. On the same day, the West German Metalworkers' Union also called on its 1.7 million members to express their support for the British shipyard workers' strike and not to take any work transferred from British shipyards to West German shipyards as a result of the strike.

After the British National Union of Railwaymen rejected the Arbitration Tribunal's recommendation on the 20th to increase wages by 3% (they had originally demanded a 10% wage increase), they announced on the 22nd that they agreed to accept a 5% wage increase and would no longer hold a strike.

    英国百万机械工人开始罢工
    新华社23日讯　伦敦消息：英国罢工运动已经扩大，一百万机械工人的罢工在今天中午十二时开始。罢工工人要求增加工资10％。
    根据机械工人工会联合会领导机构的决定，这是机械工人的“第一期”罢工。如果工人提出的要求不能得到满足，近三百万机械工人将在4月6日举行全体罢工。这样，就会使得英国的飞机制造、电气、机器和重型机械等工业部门的四千三百家工厂停工，它们的产品占英国出口货物总值的40％。
    今天的“第一期”罢工波及利物浦、布利斯托尔、曼彻斯特、格拉斯哥、设菲尔德、南安普敦和培尔法斯特等十个地区，在这些地区，罢工纠察队今天已经开始巡逻。
    同时，二十万英国造船工人的罢工仍在继续进行中。法国总工会22日号召法国造船工人支持他们。西德五金工人工会同一天也号召它的一百七十万会员对英国造船工人的罢工表示支持，不作任何因罢工而从英国的造船厂转移到西德造船厂的工作。
    英国全国铁路工人工会在20日拒绝了仲裁法院关于增加工资3％（他们原来要求增加工资10％）的建议以后，22日表示同意接受增加工资5％的建议而不再举行罢工。
