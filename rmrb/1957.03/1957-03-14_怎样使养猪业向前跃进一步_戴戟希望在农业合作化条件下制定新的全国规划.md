I have listened to the reports of Premier Zhou and other leaders, and Vice Chairman Chen, especially the wise instructions of Chairman Mao, which made me feel extremely excited and encouraged. I express my agreement and support.

I come from Anhui. Anhui was a province severely affected by disaster last year, which is something everyone cares about. Fortunately, under the leadership of the Party, all departments have worked very hard on disaster relief and have done a great job. The severe disaster is quickly becoming a thing of the past, which is gratifying and needs no further elaboration. As for my personal work in the Anhui Provincial Sports Department, I spoke about it last year, and from last year to now, it has been progressing along the foundation laid before, so there is no need to talk about it much. What I want to talk about now is the decline in hog production in some areas I have seen in Anhui. At first, I thought it was a phenomenon in local areas, but a few days ago, on March 1st, I saw the decision of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on developing hog production in the People's Daily, and I realized that this is a very serious national problem. I would like to provide some opinions on this, not limited to Anhui. I believe that everyone must pay great attention to the decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council. The decision clearly states the reasons for the decline in hog production and the remedies. Whether the trend of declining hog production can be reversed and turned into increased production in the future depends on how the established methods are implemented. According to statistics in June 1954, the total number of hogs produced nationwide reached 101 million. In June 1955, it dropped to 87 million, a decrease of 14 million in one year. By June 1956, it had fallen to 84 million. That is, from June 1955 to June 1956, the total number decreased by 17 million compared to the statistics in June 1954. In the two years from June 1954 to June 1956, the total reduction was 31 million. If we calculate the cost and profit of each pig, assuming an average price of 50 yuan, the total value of the reduction would reach 1.55 billion yuan. The corresponding reduction in pig manure fertilizer due to the reduction in hog production is also quite large, and has not been included in the calculation. Therefore, the reduction in hog production directly affects the progress of national construction and the improvement of people's lives, with quite serious consequences. Simply thinking about this number makes it worthy of special attention from the entire population. The Party Central Committee and the State Council have made very detailed decisions on reversal methods. Some of these methods can take effect as soon as they are stipulated, such as raising the purchase price of hogs. As for one of the reasons for the decline in hog production, such as the majority of tofu workshops, oil workshops, and flour workshops in rural areas ceasing production, resulting in insufficient hog feed. In the future, it is necessary to restore the production of closed tofu workshops, oil workshops, and flour workshops, which cannot be achieved by a single regulation. It is necessary to allow various localities to determine specific methods for restoring their production according to local conditions in order to achieve this. I hope the government will pay attention to this. As for the third reason for the decline in hog production pointed out in the decision: the guidance for farmers raising pigs has not adapted to the new situation after agricultural cooperativization. In other words, the original environment and conditions for farmers raising pigs have changed after agricultural cooperativization, resulting in many difficulties, changes in many environments conducive to pig raising, and the cancellation of many conditions conducive to pig raising. This aspect of the contradiction is most worthy of attention. In my country's vast rural areas, in the stage of individual agriculture, farmers raising pigs has become an important part of the rural economy over a long period of time, with many mutually adapted habits. After agricultural cooperativization, the previously adapted habits are no longer fully applicable, and farmers raising pigs have encountered some new difficulties. However, individual agriculture is behind cooperativization. We must push agriculture onto the road of cooperativization and progress. It is absolutely impossible to cancel cooperativization and restore individual agriculture because of pig raising, so that the environment and conditions adapted to farmers raising pigs in the past can exist one by one, and the habits adapted in the past can continue to be effective. Therefore, we must grasp the new environment of raising pigs after cooperativization and create new conditions according to the new environment. This is the correct direction for increasing pig production in the future. In other words, agricultural cooperativization is fundamentally changing my country's ancient rural areas, and the pig raising industry accompanying agriculture cannot but change as a result. Raising pigs in the old individual agricultural environment was generally in line with the economic conditions at that time. In the future, if we make it return to the old state one by one, it may be extremely uneconomical. The reason why farmers have not been able to profit from raising pigs recently is, of course, partly due to the rigid regulations on purchase prices and price suppression. Because the environment and conditions have changed, if the method of raising pigs is still the same as before, it may not be very economical or extremely uneconomical, that is, the cost will be high. If the increased purchase price cannot compensate for the loss caused by excessively high costs in the future, farmers' enthusiasm for raising pigs will still not be restored. I believe that in addition to various measures to reverse the decline in hog production, the state may as well gather experts and experienced old farmers to study a new national plan that is in line with the situation after agricultural cooperativization. This plan is by no means to return the pig raising industry to the state of a sideline of the old individual agriculture, but to advance it a step further in line with the new conditions after agricultural cooperativization, so that all new and most scientific methods can be applied, so that the new pig raising industry is more economical and larger in scale than raising pigs in the old individual agriculture, and makes more rational arrangements for the supply of meat to urban and rural people and the export of pork. I believe that when the state pays attention to the serious problem of the decline in hog production, this seems to be another aspect worth paying attention to.

### 怎样使养猪业向前跃进一步  戴戟希望在农业合作化条件下制定新的全国规划

    怎样使养猪业向前跃进一步
    戴戟希望在农业合作化条件下制定新的全国规划
    我在这次会议中先后听到了周总理和各位首长、陈副主席的报告，尤其是毛主席的英明指示感到无上兴奋和鼓舞，我表示同意和拥护。
    我来自安徽。安徽在去年是一个灾情严重的省份，这是大家所关怀的。幸而在党的领导下，各部门对于救灾工作，都非常努力，做得很好，严重的灾情也快成过去，这是可以告慰的。用不着多说。至于我个人所担任安徽省体育部门工作，在去年曾有发言，在去年一年到现在，还是循着以前所打下的基础进展，也用不着多谈。我现在所欲谈一谈的就我在安徽眼见到某些地区的生猪减产的情况。我初以为是局部地区的现象，在前几天本月1日人民日报上看到中共中央和国务院发展养猪生产的决定，才晓得这是一个全国性的很严重的大问题。我愿就此不限于安徽提供些意见。我以为党中央和国务院的决定，大家必须十分重视。在这个决定内，已经把生猪生产下降的原因与补救的办法，说得十分清楚。挽救生猪生产下降的趋势，从而转为增产，今后就在于所定办法如何贯彻执行了。据1954年6月统计，全国生猪生产，总数达到一亿零一百万头，1955年6月降到八千七百万头，在一年内减产一千四百万头。至1956年6月又降到八千四百万头，就是1955年6月至1956年6月比1954年6月统计总数减少了一千七百万头，在由1954年6月至1956年6月两年内计共减产了三千一百万头。如果把每头猪的成本利润计算在内，假定平均作价五十元计算，则减产总值就达人民币十五亿五千万元，而因生猪减产致猪粪肥料相应减少这个总值也相当庞大，还没有算在里面。所以生猪减产直接影响国家建设的进行和人民生活的改善，后果相当严重。简单从这个数字一想，就值得全体人民对此特别重视了。在党中央与国务院所做决定扭转办法已十分周详，其中有些办法只要作出规定便可生效，如提高生猪收购价格这一类。至于生猪减产原因之一，如农村中豆腐坊、油坊、粉坊，大部分停止生产，致生猪饲料不足。今后须使停业的豆腐坊、油坊、粉坊恢复生产，那就不是一个规定所能做到，必须允许各地因地制宜地确定它们能够恢复生产的具体办法才能办到的，我希望政府对此加以注意。至于决定内所指出生猪减产的第三原因是：对于农民养猪的指导，没有适应农业合作化后的新情况，换句话说，就是农民养猪的原来环境与条件，因农业合作化以后，发生了许多困难，变更了许多便利于养猪的环境与取消了许多便利于养猪的条件，这一方面的矛盾是最值得重视的。在我国广大的农村，在个体农业阶段，农民养猪业，在历时久远中，自成为农村经济一个重要环节，其中有许多彼此适应的习惯。农业合作化以后，以前适应的习惯，不再完全适用了，农民养猪便发生了些新的困难。但个体农业是落后于合作化的，我们必须把农业推上合作化前进的道路上，既绝对不可能因为养猪把合作化取消，恢复个体农业，使旧时适应于农民养猪的环境与条件，一一存在，使旧时适应的习惯，继续通行有效，那么，我们必须把握合作化后新的适应养猪的环境，依照新的环境去创造新的条件，这才是今后养猪增产的正确方向。换言之，农业合作化，使我国古老的农村起着根本变化，伴随着农业的养猪业，因而也是不可能不发生变化的。在旧的个体农业环境基础上养猪，一般是合乎当时经济的条件进行的，今后如果使它一一退回旧时的状态，可能是极不经济的。农民养猪在近来的不能获利，固然有些因为收购价格硬性的规定与压级压价所致，因为环境与条件变更了，养猪的方法如仍照从前一样，可能是不甚经济的或极不经济的，那就是会成本高了。如果将来在收购价格提高的部分，仍不能弥补因成本过高的损失时，农民养猪的积极性仍是不能恢复的。我以为国家在扭转生猪减产情况各种措施之外，似不妨集合专家与有经验之老农研讨一个具有全国性的符合于农业合作化以后的情况的新的规划。这个规划决不是把养猪业退回到旧时个体农业的一种副业状态，而是把它合乎农业合作化后新的条件，向前跃进一步，使一切新的最科学的方法都可应用上去，使新的养猪业比在旧时个体农业中养猪更为经济，规模更为巨大，与城乡人民肉食的供应以及猪肉出口加以更合理的安排。我以为国家在注重生猪减产的严重问题时，这似乎是值得重视的另一方面。
