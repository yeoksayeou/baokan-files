Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 13th -- Producing products of superior quality has become a major focus of the increase production and practice economy campaign at Anshan Iron and Steel's Large Rolling Mill. In the first two months of this year, the mill produced more than 6,700 tons of high-quality steel for the country and saved more than 160,000 yuan in wealth.

    During this year's increase production and practice economy campaign, the workers and technicians of the Large Rolling Mill paid special attention to improving product quality and came up with many ways to do so. Technician Chen Yijun proposed adding baffles next to the quenching machine to solve the problem of uneven quenching at both ends of heavy rails. Workers in the heating, rolling, and finishing sections proposed methods such as mastering the temperature of the heating furnace and slow cooling pit, evenly pouring cold water, and constantly paying attention to the guide plates to improve product quality. They also established systems such as holding preparation meetings before rolling and summarizing experiences and lessons learned after rolling. As a result, the product quality of the Large Rolling Mill has improved rapidly this year. In February, it created the highest record of first-class heavy rail since the plant opened, exceeding the state plan by 7.37% and increasing by 10.86% compared with the same period last year. The average first-class rate of various steel products in the plant increased by 4.82% compared with the state plan, saving the country wealth worth nearly 1,200 taels of gold.

    Currently, the workers of the Large Rolling Mill have proposed a goal of striving to produce more high-quality products. After the quality improvement plan is realized, it will save the country more than 900,000 yuan in wealth this year.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, the situation of Daye Steel Plant's product quality, which was once not high last year, has been reversed this year. In January, electric furnace steel, converter steel, high-quality forged steel, high-quality rolled steel, ordinary steel, and pig iron, among the plant's eight major products, all completed or exceeded the state-specified quality targets; in February, the quality of various products except pig iron improved again. Due to the improvement of product quality, production costs have also been reduced.

    In response to the decline in product quality, Daye Steel Plant has placed the improvement of product quality as the top priority in the increase production and practice economy campaign, and mobilized the masses of workers to solve the weak links affecting product quality. The electric furnace workshop organized technicians to study and solve the problem of subcutaneous bubbles affecting quality, and established a quality inspection and analysis meeting system to regularly check operating procedures, so that the subcutaneous bubble problem, which required the scrapping of dozens of tons of steel ingots every month, has been basically solved.

    鞍钢大型轧钢厂努力生产优等钢材
    大冶钢厂改进生产管理以后产品质量提高成本降低
    新华社鞍山13日电  生产优等质量的产品已经成为鞍钢大型轧钢厂开展增产节约运动的一个主要努力方向。这个厂在今年头两个月就为国家多生产了六千七百多吨优等质量的钢材，并且节约了十六万多元的财富。
    大型轧钢厂的职工和技术人员在今年的增产节约运动中，特别注意改进产品的质量，并且想出了许多提高产品质量的办法。技术员陈以俊提出在淬火机旁边增加挡板的办法，解决了重轨两端淬火不均匀的问题。加热、轧钢、精整等工段的职工提出了掌握加热炉、缓冷坑的温度，均匀的浇注冷水、经常注意导卫板等办法，来提高产品的质量，并且建立了轧钢前开准备会，轧钢后总结经验、吸取教训等制度。因此，今年以来，大型轧钢厂的产品质量提高很快，2月份并创造了开厂以来重轨一级品率的最高纪录，比国家计划超过7.37％，比去年同期提高10.86％。全厂各种钢材的一级品率平均比国家计划提高4.82％，为国家节约了价值将近一千两黄金的财富。
    目前，大型轧钢厂的职工已经提出为生产更多的优等质量产品而奋斗的指标。提高质量计划实现以后，今年就能给国家节约九十多万元的财富。
    据新华社讯  大冶钢厂去年产品质量一度不高的局面今年以来已经扭转。一月份，全厂八种主要产品中的电炉钢、转炉钢、优质锻钢材、优质轧钢材、普通钢材和生铁都完成或超额完成了国家规定的质量指标；2月份除生铁以外，各种产品质量又都有了提高。由于产品质量的提高，生产成本也降低了。
    针对产品质量一度降低的情况，大冶钢厂在增产节约运动中把提高产品质量列为首要的地位，发动职工群众解决影响产品质量的薄弱环节。电炉车间组织技术人员研究解决影响质量的皮下气泡问题，并建立质量检查分析会议制度，定期检查操作规程，使得每月要报废钢锭达几十吨的皮下气泡问题得到了基本解决。
