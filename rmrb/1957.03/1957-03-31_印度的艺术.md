    Indian Art
    Chang Renxia
    The history of Indian art is very long. Judging from the ancient artworks that have been discovered, highly accomplished art had already appeared in northwestern India as early as 3000 BC. In Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, seals with animal and plant patterns and primitive writing, bronze dancing girls, pottery toys, stone sculptures of human figures, and pottery and gemstone ornaments with geometric patterns have been found. These works of art have a graceful realism in the technique of human body carving, and also have good expression in physical sensation and dynamics. Therefore, it can be inferred that India had a long history of artistic creation in the prehistoric period.
    Mohenjo-daro is an ancient city with neat buildings of streets and drainage systems, and rich gold, silver, gems and colored pottery decorations. According to the inferences of historians and archaeologists, this art was created before the Aryans entered India. This nation left architectural remains and other cultural relics, and began the first page of Indian art history. Among the original inhabitants of India, the Dravidians also created a high culture; but since the Aryans settled in India, the culture and art of these two ethnic groups have gradually merged into one, becoming the foundation of today's Indian art tradition.
    Around 3000 to 2000 BC, the Aryans arrived in the five river basins of northwestern India (now Punjab Province), and around 2000 to 1500 BC, they migrated to the Ganges River basin. During this development process, the Aryans created Brahmanism. In the sixth century BC, Buddhism and Jainism arose to resist the caste system of Brahmanism. These religions have had a great influence on Indian art such as architecture, sculpture and painting. Due to the spread of Buddhism in Eastern countries, its artistic influence also spread from India to many countries in the East.
    Indian Buddhist art began in the era of King Ashoka of the Mauryan Dynasty of Magadha in the third century BC. The stone pillars erected by King Ashoka to commemorate Shakyamuni still exist in ten places. The tops of the pillars have carvings of lions, elephants, cattle, horses, and precious wheels, which are solemn and beautiful. Among them, the lion capital of Sarnath is the most famous and has been used as the national emblem of the new India after its independence. During the Ashoka period, many stone pagodas were also built to store the relics of the Buddha. The outside of the pagoda is surrounded by stone railings, carved with ancient myths and legends. It is said that 84,000 pagodas were built at that time, and the Great Stupa of Sanchi is the most complete and beautiful one preserved to this day. The doors of the Great Stupa of Sanchi are carved with stories of the Buddha's Jataka, carving the hard stone as if it were ivory filigree; other great stupas, such as the Great Stupa of Bodh Gaya, have been rebuilt, but the stone railings surrounding the outside of the stupa are still ancient carvings. Another large pagoda is in Bharhut, which has been destroyed. The remaining buildings of its stone railings are still preserved in the Indian Museum in Calcutta. Some of these carvings depict the images and lives of ancient working people, some depict stories from ancient legends, and some depict animals and plants of the time. They are full of working enthusiasm and good wishes, and have no illusory colors. In terms of carving techniques, there is a delicate and solid foundation. The artistic achievements left by the Mauryan Dynasty have lasted for 2,200 years to this day, and its brilliance has not diminished due to the long years. It is an original Indian artistic style in ancient times, and has valuable contributions in world art. These artworks are treasures of India and the people of the world.
    Following the Magadha Kingdom, in the first century AD, the Great Yuezhi occupied Gandhara in the upper reaches of the Indus River and merged with Taxila to establish the Great Yuezhi Kingdom. By the third generation of King Kanishka, around the end of the first century to the middle of the second century, he made some contributions to Buddhist art. The carving of Buddha statues began at this time. In previous Buddhist art, there were no Buddha statues. The footprints of the Buddha, the Buddha's bone tower, or the Buddha's preaching throne became objects of worship for believers. At this time, the image of the Buddha was carved according to the human image, which is the Gandhara art passed down through the ages. For a period of time, some scholars said that this art was a combination of Greek and Indian art, but it is still an original Indian style, and there is an obvious difference from Greek art.
    In the third century AD, the power of the Great Yuezhi in central and northern India and the Andhra kingdom in the south declined. The Gupta Dynasty rose up after that. It unified India, stabilized the lives of the people, and encouraged the development of its inherent literature, art, and religion. Hinduism rose at this time, and its sculptural art swept away the past style of Gandhara. It selected strong and beautiful archetypes from the Indian people. The refined techniques such as the back light and clothing patterns of the Buddha statue have surpassed the artistic achievements of the past. The Buddhist art of the Gupta Dynasty had a great influence on Chinese Buddhist art. For example, the construction of Buddhist art in Yungang, Longmen, and Dunhuang in China was influenced by the Buddhist art of the Gupta Dynasty. The famous Chinese monk Faxian also toured the Buddhist sites in India during the Gupta Dynasty. The Indian art of this period has been called the golden age in history.
    At the end of the fifth century, the Gupta Dynasty suffered looting and destruction by the Huns, and almost all Buddhist buildings in northwestern India were destroyed. Gandhara also became ruins, and its political power gradually declined and eventually perished. The Dravidian kings in the south protected Hinduism and revered the Hindu god Shiva, and built many temples and pagodas in various places. Often the entire stone mountain is split open and a temple is carved according to the composition design. The architectural feature of Hinduism is that both the interior and exterior focus on sculpture. There are two types of architectural styles, circular and square, which are very harmonious. It has a unique style in world architectural art. Because the construction uses stone, it is strong and durable. To this day, ancient Hindu buildings still exist in South India. King Shiladitya in the north believed in Buddhism, and Buddhist temples were very prosperous in the early seventh century. The famous Chinese monk Xuanzang went to India at this time, and he recorded the carvings and architecture of Buddhist temples at that time in "The Great Tang Records on the Western Regions". The King Harsha recorded in the Chinese Tang Dynasty books is the Indian Shiladitya II.
    Northern India was occupied by Muslims in the early eleventh century. As a result, new elements were added to its culture and art, which was distinctly different from Southern India, which preserved ancient traditions. The Islamic architectural style also developed in Indian art, especially the exquisite and perfect architectural pattern carving, which reached amazing skills. It fully expresses the wisdom and perseverance of the Indian people. The famous Taj Mahal is an outstanding example.
    The architecture of northern and eastern India mostly originated from small round-roofed huts. Bamboo and wood were first used as the framework, covered with mud and grass to shield from wind and rain. Ordinary people and monks in the mountains lived in this kind of hut, which still exists today. This kind of hut is also a thatched hut, and its form still exists in the Northern Wei murals in Dunhuang, China. Later, in its development into magnificent stone buildings, or in the carving of grottoes, this primitive construction style was still preserved.
    The Hindu temple and pagoda architecture in South India has a round pile shape and a rectangular pile shape, which is similar to the form of piled straw. Its origin is probably related to the primitive hut like a straw pile. The interior and exterior carvings and decorations of these stone buildings are very rich and exquisite.
    Indian painting also has a long history. Primitive cave murals still exist today. From the first and second centuries to the seventh century AD, the Ajanta cave paintings in western India are world-renowned treasures. These murals are works of Buddhist art, and are recorded in Xuanzang's "The Great Tang Records on the Western Regions". Due to the influence of Islamic culture, Indian painting was also stained with Persian style. In the sixteenth century, the Mughal dynasty was founded. Due to the advocacy of the rulers, the painters abandoned the traditional mural creation and turned to movable small paintings, turning from religious themes to the life themes of officials and nobles. The Indian painting style then merged with the Persian painting style. Since the Tang Dynasty in China, Persia has worshipped Chinese art and imitated the style of Chinese painting. Therefore, it was passed to India, indirectly influencing Indian flower and bird painting.
    From that time until the British colonialists invaded India, India had various schools of painting, such as the Rajput School, the Jodhpur School, the Mughal School, and the Kangra School, but they could not get rid of the influence of Persian miniature paintings. After the British imperialists ruled India, the European painting style was also introduced into India.
    Under the initiative of the famous Indian poet Tagore, the Indian Renaissance movement was launched in the 1870s. The poet created an international university and established an art academy. His nephew, Abanindranath Tagore, was the chief painter of India and succeeded him as president. Nandalal Bose, the principal of the art academy, was also the successor of Abanindranath. They pursued the traditional methods of ancient Ajanta murals, searched for painting topics from ancient myths and epics, created images from the lives of Indian people, abandoned the colors of oil paintings and used watercolors. Mr. Nandalal Bose once came to China and Japan, absorbing methods from Chinese and Japanese paintings. His creations integrated the excellent traditions of the East and ancient India in terms of sentiment, charm, and even techniques, becoming the artistic style of modern Indian painting. Poet Tagore also made great efforts in the research and development of poetry, drama, music, dance, as well as colored pottery, colored leather making, weaving, printing and dyeing, and工艺美术.
    Today's Indian handicrafts, such as carvings, inlays, bronzes, sandalwood wood products, etc., are all made by Indian labor craftsmen. Its patterns, styles and colors express the different ingenuity of local artists. Especially its brocade art, which has a style similar to that of China, has aroused great love from the Chinese people.
    The close relationship between China and India in art has a long history. Since the Eastern Han Dynasty, Chinese monks have gone to India for pilgrimage, and Indian monks have also come to China for pilgrimage. Due to the spread of religion, religious sculptures and paintings, music, dance and folk art have also been passed on. The Ajanta of India and the Mogao Grottoes, Maijishan Grottoes, Yungang Grottoes and Longmen Grottoes in China are mainly creations of the Gupta Dynasty and the Northern Wei Dynasty. They are the simultaneous expressions of wisdom of the two major ethnic groups. By the Sui and Tang Dynasties, Indian music and dance were listed as a part of court music and dance and were popularized among the people. However, according to the records of Master Xuanzang, the Qin Wang Po Zhen music was also transmitted to India and received great praise from King Harsha. From these historical documents, it can be seen that more than a thousand years ago, Chinese art and Indian art had already exchanged and absorbed each other. Now, with the increase of friendship between the people of China and India, our love for Indian art has also deepened. (Attached picture)

    印度的艺术
    常任侠
    印度艺术的历史是非常悠久的，就现在已经发现的古代艺术品来判断，远在公元前三千年，印度西北部已出现了高度艺术的成就。在莫罕交·达罗和哈拉巴，发现了带有动物植物图样和原始文字的印章、铜制的舞女、陶烧的玩具、石刻的人像，以及绘有几何纹的陶器和宝石制的装饰品等等。这些艺术品在人体雕造的技巧上，具有优美的写实性，在肉体的感觉与动态上，也有很好的表现。因此可以推知印度在史前期，已有很久的艺术创造的历史。
    莫罕交·达罗是一处古代的城市，这里有街巷和排水系统的整齐建筑，有丰富的金银宝石和彩色陶烧的装饰品。据历史学者和考古学者的推论，这种艺术是雅利安人进入印度以前的作品。这个民族留下了建筑的遗址和其他文化遗物，开始了印度艺术史上的第一页。在印度先住民族中，达罗毘荼族人也曾创造了很高的文化；但自雅利安人定居印度后，这两族的文化艺术，业已逐渐混合为一，成为今日印度艺术传统的基础。
    约在公元前三千至两千年间，雅利安人就到达了印度西北的五河（即今旁遮普省）流域，约在公元前两千至一千五百年间，再移殖到恒河流域。在这个发展过程中，雅利安人创造了婆罗门教。到公元前六世纪，佛教与耆那教兴起，以反抗婆罗门教的种姓制度。这几种宗教，在印度的建筑、雕刻和绘画等艺术方面，都发生了很大的影响。由于佛教在东方各国的传播，它的艺术影响也从印度传播到东方的许多国家。
    印度的佛教艺术，始于公元前三世纪摩竭陀国孔雀王朝的阿育王时代。阿育王为纪念释迦牟尼所立的石柱，现在保存的尚有十处。柱顶有狮子、象、牛、马、宝轮等雕刻，庄严华美，其中以鹿野苑的狮子柱头为最有名，已经做为独立后新印度的国徽。在阿育王时代，又曾建立很多石塔，以藏佛的遗骨，塔外有石栏围绕，雕刻着古代的神话和传说中的事物。据说当时曾建了八万四千塔，保存至今的，山奇大塔是最完整美好的一处。山奇大塔的各门，雕刻着佛本生的故事，把坚硬的石质，雕刻得仿佛像是象牙细工；其他如菩提场的大塔，已经重建，但是大塔外围绕的石栏，还是古代雕刻的旧物。另一处大塔在巴尔胡提，业已残毁，它的石栏残余建筑，还保存在加尔各答的印度博物馆中。这些雕刻中有的表现着古代劳动人民的形象和生活，有的表现着古传说中的故事，有的表现着当时的动物和植物，它们都充满着劳作的热情和善良的愿望，并无虚幻的色彩。在雕刻的手法上，有精巧而坚实的基础。孔雀王朝所留下的艺术成绩，到今天已经二千二百年，并不因为年代的悠久而减少它的光彩，它是印度古代独创的艺术风格，在世界艺术中，有可贵的贡献，这些艺术品是印度的也是世界人民的珍宝。
    继摩竭陀国之后，在公元一世纪时，大月氏族占据了印度河上游的犍陀罗，与塔克西拉地方合并，建立了大月氏国。到第三代的迦腻色伽王，约在公元一世纪末至二世纪中，又对佛教艺术作了一些贡献，佛像的雕造，即开始于这个时候。以前的佛教艺术中，并没有佛像。佛的足迹、佛的骨塔，或是佛说法的宝座，成为信徒们礼拜的对象。到这时按照人的形象，雕刻了佛的形象，也就是传世的犍陀罗艺术。有一个时期，在学者中曾说这种艺术是希腊与印度艺术的合体，但它仍然是印度的特创风格，与希腊艺术有显然的区别。
    在公元三世纪，印度中部和北部的大月氏国与南部的安度罗国，势力都已衰退。继之而起的是笈多王朝。它统一了印度，安定了人民的生活，奖励发展固有的文学艺术与宗教。印度教就在这个时候兴起，它的雕刻造型艺术，一扫过去犍陀罗的风貌。它从印度人中，选择壮健与美丽的典型。如佛像的背光和衣纹等精细的手法，已超越了过去的艺术成绩。笈多王朝的佛教艺术，给中国的佛教艺术以很大的影响，如中国的云岗、龙门和敦煌等佛教艺术的修造，都曾受笈多王朝时代佛教艺术的影响。中国著名的高僧法显，也曾在笈多时代巡礼过印度的佛迹。这时期的印度艺术，曾被称为历史上的黄金时代。
    到五世纪末，笈多王朝遭受匈奴人的劫掠破坏，印度西北部的佛教建筑，几乎都被毁灭。犍陀罗也成了丘墟，其政治势力逐渐衰退，终于灭亡。在南方的达罗毗荼族诸王，保护印度教，崇敬印度教湿神婆，在各地建筑了许多寺塔。常常将整个的石山劈开，按照构图设计，凿成一座寺宇。印度教建筑特点是内部和外部都注重雕刻。建筑式样，有圆形和方形的两种，都很和谐，它在世界建筑艺术中，独具一种风格。由于建造取用石材，坚固耐久，在南印度至今仍存有这种印度教的古建筑。在北方的尸罗迭多王崇信佛教，在七世纪初年，佛寺颇盛。我国著名的玄奘法师，即在这时赴印，他在“大唐西域记”中，曾记录着当时佛寺的雕刻建筑。我国唐书中记录的戒日王，就是印度的尸罗迭多二世。
    北方印度在十一世纪初，为伊斯兰教人所侵占。因之文化艺术均有新的成分加入，与保存着古代传统的南方印度，有显明的不同。伊斯兰建筑作风，在印度艺术中也有发展，特别是建筑图案雕刻的精细完美，达到了可惊的技巧。它充分地表达了印度人民的智慧和毅力。著名的泰姬·玛哈儿陵就是一个杰出的例子。
    北部和东部印度的建筑，多起源于圆顶的小草屋，最早使用竹木作骨干，上面敷着泥和草，以蔽风雨，一般人民与山林间的修士，都居住着这种至今尚有遗存的小屋。这种小屋也就是草庵，在我国敦煌的北魏壁画中，尚存有它的形式。以后在其发展为石材的壮丽建筑中，或是石窟的雕凿中，都仍旧保存着这种原始的建造式样。
    在南印的印度教寺塔建筑，有圆堆形的，有长方堆形的，与堆集稻草的形式相似，它的起源与草堆似的原始小屋大概也有关系。这些石材的建筑，其内部的雕刻装饰与外部的雕刻装饰，都很丰富精巧。
    印度的绘画，也有其悠久的历史。原始的洞窟壁画，至今尚存。自公元第一、二世纪到第七世纪，西印度的阿旃陀石窟画，是驰名世界的宝藏。这些壁画是佛教艺术的作品，在玄奘的“大唐西域记”中，曾有记载。由于伊斯兰文化的影响，在印度的绘画上也沾染了波斯的作风。到十六世纪时，莫卧儿王朝创立，画家们由于统治者的提倡，舍弃了传统的壁画创作，趋向于可移动的小型画，从宗教的题材，转向官廷贵族的生活题材。印度画风，遂与波斯画风合于一途。波斯自从中国唐代以来，崇拜中国的艺术，模仿中国画的式样，因此辗转传入印度，使印度的花鸟画，也间接受了中国画的影响。
    从那时起，到英国殖民主义者侵入印度以前，印度曾有过各种画派，例如拉吉普坦派、汝德堡尔派、莫卧儿派、康葛拉派等等，但都脱不了波斯小型画的影响。英帝国主义者统治印度以后，欧洲的画风也随之传入印度。
    在著名的印度诗人泰戈尔的创议下于十九世纪七十年代发起了印度的文艺复兴运动。诗人自创国际大学，设立美术学院。他的侄子阿邦宁·泰戈尔，是印度的首席画师，曾继他而任校长。美术学院的院长南陀·报司，又是阿邦宁画师的继承者。他们追求古代阿旃壁画传统的方法，从古代神话传说和史诗中寻找画题，从印度人民生活中创造形象，舍弃了油画的颜色而用水彩，南陀·报司先生曾来中国和日本，从中国绘画中和日本绘画中吸取方法，其创作在情调、韵味以至技巧方面，都融合了东方的以及古印度的优良传统，成为现代印度绘画的艺术风格。诗人泰戈尔同时在诗歌、戏剧、音乐、舞蹈以及彩画陶器、彩画制革、织布印染工艺美术的研究和发展上，都尽了很大的努力。
    印度今天的手工艺品，如雕刻细工、嵌石、铜器、檀香木器等等，都出于印度的劳动手工艺人之手，它的图案、式样与色泽，表现着各地艺人不同的匠心。尤其它的织锦艺术，与中国颇有相似的作风，引起中国人民很大的爱好。
    中国与印度，在艺术上的亲密关系，是有悠久历史的。从东汉以来，中国的僧侣到印度去巡礼，印度的僧侣也到中国来巡礼，由于宗教的传播，宗教的雕刻与绘画，音乐舞蹈和民间艺术，也伴随着传来。印度的阿旃陀与中国的敦煌千佛洞、麦积山石窟、云岗石窟和龙门石刻等，主要是笈多王朝和北魏时代的创造，是两大民族同时代的智慧表现。到隋唐时代，印度的音乐舞蹈，被列为宫廷乐舞的一部，并且普及到民间。但据玄奘法师的记载，秦王破阵乐也传至印度，得到戒日王很大的赞美。从这些历史的文献看来，可知在千余年前，中国艺术与印度艺术，已经互相交流、互相吸收。现在，随着中、印两国人民友谊的增进，我们对印度艺术的爱好也更加深了。（附图片）
