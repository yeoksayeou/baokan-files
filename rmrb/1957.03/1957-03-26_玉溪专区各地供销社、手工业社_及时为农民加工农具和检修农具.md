　　Yuxi Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperatives and Handicraft Cooperatives
　　Promptly Process and Repair Farm Tools for Farmers

    Our newspaper, Yuxi, 23rd Dispatch: Supply and marketing cooperatives and handicraft cooperatives in Yuxi Special District, Yunnan Province, have been going deep into the countryside to promptly resolve the supply of production materials.

    Since December of last year, supply and marketing cooperatives in many counties in the district have specifically organized production material procurement and supply teams to go deep into the countryside to purchase raw materials and investigate actual needs. In addition to concentrating their main efforts on farm tool processing, most handicraft cooperatives have also organized a portion of their workforce to go to the countryside to repair farm tools for farmers. For example, there are forty-nine blacksmith furnaces in Jiangchuan County going to the countryside. Chengjiang County plans to have a furnace in each agricultural cooperative during the spring plowing season, specifically for repairing farm tools for the agricultural cooperative.

    In organizing the supply of production materials, various places have generally felt that there is a shortage of iron raw materials. For example, Yimen County needs more than 3,000 shovels and hoes, but due to the shortage of iron, handicraft cooperatives can only deliver 700. Other counties have similar situations. In order to solve this problem, the Jiangchuan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative specifically organized forces to go deep into the countryside to purchase scrap iron, calling for "one jin per household." This call was enthusiastically supported by farmers, and more than 35,000 jin of scrap iron were purchased in a short period of time.

　　玉溪专区各地供销社、手工业社
　　及时为农民加工农具和检修农具
    本报玉溪23日电　云南省玉溪专区各地供销社和手工业社，深入农村及时解决生产资料供应问题。
    自去年12月以来，该区不少县的供销社专门组织了生产资料采购供应小组，深入农村采购原料和调查实际需要。大部分手工业社除了集中主要力量进行农具加工外，也组织了一部分力量下乡为农民修补农具。如江川县下乡的铁匠炉就有四十九盘。澄江县计划在春耕生产期间，做到每个农业社设一盘炉，专门为农业社修理农具。
    在组织生产资料供应中，各地普遍感到铁的原材料不足。如易门县，需要板锄、条锄三千多把，但因缺铁，手工业社只能交七百把。其他各县也都有类似的情况。为了解决这一问题，江川县供销社专门组织力量，深入农村收购废铁，号召“每户一斤”。这一号召受到农民热烈的支持，在短短的时间内就收购了三万五千多斤废铁。
