    Prime Minister Široký in Zhangguozhuang
    By our reporter

    Among the tens of thousands of villages in our motherland, many are famous far and wide for various reasons, even though they cannot be found as a small dot on the map. The name of Zhangguozhuang in Fengtai District, Beijing, has spread far beyond the borders due to the friendship between China and Czechoslovakia. On March 12, Prime Minister Široký and the Czechoslovak government delegation visited the site of this China-Czechoslovakia Friendship Agricultural Production Cooperative, bringing the greatest honor and excitement to the more than two thousand peasant households of Zhangguozhuang.

    Yesterday morning, the early spring sun bathed Lujing Village in Zhangguozhuang. A joyful crowd gathered in the east of the village from about eight o'clock in the morning to welcome the distinguished guests. When the clock struck 9:45, Prime Minister Široký, accompanied by his wife and distinguished members of the delegation, arrived here. Amidst warm applause, the boisterous sound of gongs and drums, and the melodious Czech folk songs emanating from the loudspeakers, the distinguished guests were welcomed into the welcome venue – a small square in front of the township people's committee. A welcoming meeting with nearly a thousand people in attendance was held here. Guo Rong, the director of the cooperative, delivered a speech first. He said: In the few years since we established friendship with the agricultural production cooperative of Vinarice village in Czechoslovakia, we have received tractors, new agricultural machinery, medical equipment, and books from Czechoslovakia. Because of your support and encouragement, you have helped our cooperative develop rapidly from a small cooperative of dozens of households to a large cooperative of more than two thousand one hundred households now. ... Comrade Prime Minister, we will never forget the benefits you have given us. Therefore, on behalf of all the cooperative members, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to you and the people of Czechoslovakia! The Minister of Finance of the Czechoslovak Republic, J. Ďuriš, responded by saying that the people of Czechoslovakia have always been enthusiastically concerned about the construction of the Chinese people. He said that the exhibits seen by the delegation at the agricultural exhibition on the 11th proved that Chinese farmers are striving for high yields.

    After the welcoming meeting, the distinguished guests were welcomed into a meeting room of about fifty square meters to be seated. On the table were plates of locally made refreshments – fried sweet potatoes and peanuts. While eating, the distinguished guests listened to Cooperative Director Guo Rong introducing the development of the cooperative over the past few years and future production plans. After Guo Rong finished speaking, Prime Minister Široký stood up to introduce the members of the delegation to everyone. His introduction was brief and humorous. When introducing the Minister of Health, Plojhara, he said that this minister had discovered a panacea that could cure all diseases, and that this medicine was wine. This sentence aroused applause and laughter. Later, the Prime Minister inquired in detail about the production management, income distribution, state assistance to the cooperative, and the use of labor within the cooperative. He then said that Czechoslovakia and China are different, and there are many differences in climate, crop types, agronomic practices, and labor. The collectivization of agriculture in Czechoslovakia must
    be achieved through mechanization, so the role of agricultural machinery stations is very important.

    When the director of the cooperative sought Prime Minister Široký's opinions and criticisms, he politely said that because the situations in China and Czechoslovakia are different, it is difficult for him to make any suggestions to the hosts. He said that the situation introduced by the host just now shows that the cause of socialism is advancing victoriously in this village.

    After Prime Minister Široký finished speaking, the members of the delegation began to talk with the hosts nearby. The Prime Minister's wife left her seat and took the interpreter to talk with the women and children in the cooperative. While praising the health and vitality of the Chinese children, she distributed the gifts she had specially brought today – Czechoslovak Young Pioneer badges and landscape postcards. At this time, the sun was already shining obliquely through the window, adding warmth and friendship to the room.

    At 11:15, the distinguished guests drove to visit the cooperative's pumping station. This pumping station, located on the banks of the Yongding River, was built last spring using machines donated by Czechoslovak friends. Here, Prime Minister Široký and the members of the delegation personally went down to the basement to learn about the equipment of the pumping station and its functions. Afterwards, Cooperative Director Guo Rong introduced to the distinguished guests the members' quarrying of stones on the river bank (one of the cooperative's side businesses) and afforestation on the opposite bank.

    Next, the distinguished guests returned to visit the "China-Czechoslovakia Friendship Exhibition Room" displaying various gifts donated by Czechoslovak friends, and a primary school in the township. When he learned that this was originally a temple, he specifically asked: Was the conversion of the temple into a school the government's idea or the people's idea? The director of the cooperative replied: This was the request of the villagers. Prime Minister Široký and the members of the delegation also took a group photo with the cadres of the China-Czechoslovakia Friendship Agricultural Cooperative. Later, they visited the clinic built with medical equipment donated by Czechoslovakia. Prime Minister Široký asked the doctor with concern how many people came to the clinic for treatment every day and how many people's health this clinic had to take care of. When saying goodbye, he wished Zhangguozhuang fewer and fewer patients every year, and humorously said: None of us who came here are patients, so we can leave. Finally, Prime Minister Široký and his wife visited the homes of cooperative members Zhang Jinhua and Liang Dejin respectively and had cordial conversations with them. When the Prime Minister's wife learned that the ten-member family she visited had an income of more than 1,200 yuan and a surplus of more than 600 yuan last year, she expressed her satisfaction and shook hands with the Liang Dejin family one by one.

    At 12:20, the distinguished guests bid farewell to all the residents of the village. Prime Minister Široký shook hands firmly with Cooperative Director Guo Rong and said that they must tell the old friends of Zhangguozhuang – the members of Vinarice village – about what they saw and heard today when they returned, and encourage them to work harder and launch a mutual competition with the members of Zhangguozhuang.

    西罗基总理在张郭庄
    本报记者
    在我们祖国成千成万个乡村中，有许多村庄虽然在地图上占不到一个小点，但它们却由于各种原因而远近闻名。北京丰台区张郭庄的名声就以中捷友谊而远远越出了国界。3月12日，西罗基总理和捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团来到这个中捷友好农业生产合作社的所在地访问，给张郭庄的二千多户农民带来了最大的光荣和兴奋。
    昨天上午，早春的阳光沐浴着张郭庄的卢井村。欢乐的人群从早上八点左右就聚集在村东头迎候贵宾。时针指到九点三刻时，西罗基总理偕同夫人和代表团贵宾们来到这里。在热烈的掌声，喧闹的锣鼓声和从广播器传出来的悠扬的捷克民歌声中，贵宾们被拥着迎到了欢迎会场——乡人民委员会前的小广场上。在这里举行了一个有近千人参加的欢迎会。社主任郭荣首先致词。他说：我们和捷克斯洛伐克维纳尔日采村的农业生产合作社建立友谊的几年来，曾经收到来自捷克斯洛伐克的拖拉机、新式农业机器、医疗器械和图书。由于你们对我们这样的支持和鼓舞，帮助我们的合作社迅速的发展起来，由几十户的小社，发展到现在的两千一百多户的大社了。……总理同志，你们给予我们的这些好处，我们是永远不能忘记的。所以，我受全体社员的委托，向你和捷克斯洛伐克人民表示诚恳的感谢！捷克斯洛伐克共和国财政部长尤·杜里什致答词说，捷克斯洛伐克人民一向热情地关切着中国人民的建设。他说代表团11日在农业展览会上看到的展品证明中国农民在努力争取丰产。
    在欢迎会后，贵宾们被迎入一间约有五十平方公尺的会议室就座。这里的桌上摆着一盘盘土制的茶点——炸白薯和花生果。贵宾们一边吃一边听社主任郭荣向大家介绍合作社几年来的发展情况和今后的生产规划。在郭荣讲完后，西罗基总理站起来向大家介绍了代表团的各位团员。他的介绍简短而风趣。在介绍到卫生部长普洛伊哈时，他说这位部长发现了一种能治百病的灵药，这种药就是酒。这句话引起了人们的掌声和欢笑。后来，总理详细地询问了合作社的生产管理、收益分配、国家对合作社的帮助，合作社内劳动力的利用情形等。接着他说，捷克斯洛伐克和中国不同，在气候、作物种类、农艺操作规程、劳动力等方面都有许多差别。捷克斯洛伐克农业的合作化必须
    要靠机械化来实现，因此农业机器站的作用很重要。
    当社主任征求西罗基总理的意见和批评时，他客气地表示，由于中捷两国情况不同，所以他很难向主人提什么建议。他说，刚才主人介绍的情况说明，社会主义的事业正在这个村庄里胜利前进。
    在西罗基总理讲完后，代表团的人员就分别同邻近的主人交谈起来。总理夫人离开座位带着翻译找社里的妇女和儿童谈话。她一面称赞中国儿童的健康活泼，一面就把今天特地带来的礼物——捷克斯洛伐克少先队章和风景画片分送给大家。这时，阳光已经从窗口斜照进来，使这间屋子更加增添了暖意和友情。
    十一时一刻，贵宾们驱车前往合作社的抽水机站参观。这个设立在永定河畔的抽水机站是去年春天用捷克斯洛伐克朋友赠送的机器建立起来的。在这里，西罗基总理和代表团人员亲自下到地下室里了解了抽水机站的设备和它们的功能。出来，社主任郭荣又向贵宾们介绍了社员们在河岸采石（社里的副业之一）和对岸造林的情形。
    接着，贵宾们又回来参观了陈列着捷克斯洛伐克朋友赠送的各种礼物的“中捷友谊展览室”和乡里的一个小学。当他知道这里原来是一个庙宇的时候，特别问道：把庙宇改成学校是政府的意见还是老百姓的意见。社主任回答说：这是村里居民的要求。西罗基总理和代表团人员还在这里同中捷友好农业合作社的干部们合影留念。后来他们又参观了用捷克斯洛伐克赠送的医疗器材建立起来的诊疗所。西罗基总理关心地问大夫，这里一天有多少人来治病，这个诊疗所要照顾多少人的健康。在告辞的时候，他祝张郭庄的病人一年比一年少，并且幽默地说：我们来的人中间没有病人，因此可以走了。最后，西罗基总理和夫人又分别访问了社员张金华和梁德金的家庭，同他们作了亲切的谈话。当总理夫人知道她所访问的这个十口之家，去年一年收入达一千二百多元并结余六百多元时，她表示十分满意，并且同梁德金家人一一握手。
    十二时二十分，贵宾们向全村居民辞别。西罗基总理紧紧地握着社主任郭荣的手说，他们回去一定要把今天的所见所闻告诉张郭庄的老朋友——维纳尔日采村的社员们，并且要勉励他们加紧努力，同张郭庄的社员们展开相互的竞赛。
