　　Solving the Problems of Member Overpayments and Debts
　　Jianghong Agricultural Cooperative Establishes Advance Payment System
    (Our newspaper's dispatch) Our reporter Chen Jun reports: The Guanzhuang Jianghong Agricultural Cooperative in Hongzhao County, Shanxi Province, has resolved the problems of member overpayments and debts by establishing a system of three advance payments and two distributions per year. This has further enhanced the members' understanding of the principle of "more work, more pay" and has greatly increased their enthusiasm for production. The attendance rate for male laborers has increased to 97%, and for female laborers, it has reached over 90%.
    When the reporter arrived in Guanzhuang, a strong impression was that the village was very quiet. The members were all busy collecting manure, delivering manure, repairing irrigation ditches, and selecting cotton seeds. Sections of the main road had been dug up to use the old surface as fertilizer, and new river mud had been laid down.
    The Jianghong Cooperative members' enthusiasm for production was high throughout the past year. In the fall, 90% of the cooperative's fields were plowed, and the winter wheat was planted quickly and well. However, around the Spring Festival, the members' morale suddenly declined. The reason was that after the distribution and final settlement, members with many workdays and small advance payments could not receive the money they were due; and those who had taken too much in advance payments could not repay the cooperative.
    When the cooperative cadres encountered this problem, under the direction of the county party committee, they decided to improve the economic system and conducted an education campaign among the members, combining theory with practice, on the principle of "more work, more pay."
    The cooperative's management committee first conducted an inspection. Last year, because the higher authorities emphasized taking care of members' living difficulties, the cooperative cadres had a paternalistic view and lent money whenever members asked for it. In addition, last year's plan was overly ambitious, estimating that each workday would be worth three yuan, so some members borrowed as much as possible. As a result, more than 142,000 yuan was lent out throughout the year. At the time of distribution, the production shares, equity fund, public welfare fund, public accumulation fund, and the surplus funds of some members were all used to make up the difference, but there was still a shortfall of more than 33,000 yuan. Two hundred and twenty-nine households were unable to receive the money they were due, and five hundred and ten households had borrowed more from the cooperative than the value of the grain and money they were entitled to receive, owing the cooperative a total of more than 44,000 yuan. This situation caused ideological confusion among the members.
    In addition, they analyzed the specific circumstances of the indebted households.
    Therefore, the management committee convened a meeting of member representatives, a meeting of all members, and a forum for indebted households to explain the actual situation and repeatedly discussed solutions to the problem.
    The measures they took were, first, to clear the accounts. Among the overpayment households, after offsetting unpaid equity funds, production equity funds, and debts owed to the cooperative from the elementary cooperative stage, only ninety-three households had remaining funds in the cooperative, if conditions allowed. After offsetting the debts of indebted households with any surplus funds in the cooperative from previous years and the unpaid balance for production materials, the number of households still owing money to the cooperative was reduced to two hundred and fifty-eight.
    The second step was to help indebted members make plans to ensure that they could repay their debts. Among them, one hundred and fifty-two households could support themselves through production. The methods included organizing sideline occupations, raising pigs, and accumulating fertilizer; the cooperative assigned light work to take care of elderly and weak women so they could participate in labor; and some, without affecting their livelihood, deducted a portion of their money from each advance payment to repay the cooperative. Others could use their existing surplus grain and cotton to repay their debts. Forty-six households of officers, staff, teachers, and doctors could use the remittances and wages sent back to repay their debts. In addition, the cooperative used public welfare funds to provide relief to those who were truly in difficulty and unable to solve their problems on their own.
    Third, it was decided to adopt a system of three advance payments (during the spring plowing, the Dragon Boat Festival, and the Mid-Autumn Festival) and two distributions (after the summer harvest and the autumn harvest), with no arbitrary small loans during normal times. Regular advance payments would allow members to use each advance payment in a planned manner.
    Through these efforts, the members received a profound education. Indebted households said that they had not considered the difficulties of the cooperative in the past and that they would work hard this year to repay the money they had borrowed from the cooperative.

　　解决社员长款和欠款问题
　　江宏农业社建立预支制度
    本报讯　本报记者陈浚报道：山西省洪赵县官庄江宏农业社，解决了社员的长款和欠款问题，规定每年三次预支、两次分配的制度，使社员进一步认识到多劳多得、按劳取酬的原则，生产热情空前提高。出勤率男劳动力已提高到97％，女劳动力也达到90％以上。
    记者走进官庄，一个强烈的印象是，村里静悄悄的。社员们都忙着起粪、送粪、修水渠、选棉花籽去了，一段段的大路，旧的路面都被挖去做了肥料，铺上了新挖的河泥。
    江宏社社员的生产热情去年一年都是较高的。在秋后，社里90％的田地进行了秋翻，冬麦种得又快又好。可是，到了春节前后，社员情绪突然低落了。原来是经过分配决算以后，劳动日多、预支少的社员，应分的钱拿不到手；预支过多，欠了社里的钱的还不出来。
    社干部碰到这个问题，在县委的指示下，决定改进经济制度，并在社员中进行一次结合实际的多劳多得、按劳取酬的教育。
    社管理委员会首先进行了检查。去年由于上级强调照顾社员生活困难，社干部有恩赐观点，社员提出要借钱就借给；加上去年计划偏高，预计每个劳动日能够分配三元，有的社员就尽量借支。结果，全年借出十四万二千多元。到分配的时候，把生产股金、股份基金、公益金、公积金和部分社员多余的款项都垫付出去，还差三万三千多元。有二百二十九户应分的钱，拿不到；有五百一十户向社预借的钱，超过了应分得的粮款，共欠社四万四千多元。这种情况，造成了社员的思想混乱。
    此外，他们还分析了欠款户的具体情况。
    于是，管理委员会先后召开了社员代表大会、社员大会、欠款户座谈会，说明实际情况，并反复讨论了解决问题的办法。
    他们采取的办法是第一步清算账目。长款户中，在条件允许的情况下，抵销了未缴的股份基金、生产股份基金和在初级社欠社的钱以后，在社还有余款的就只剩下九十三户。欠款户同历年在社有余款、生产资料折价未还的款项抵销后，还欠社款的也缩小到二百五十八户。
    第二步，逐户帮助欠款社员，订出计划，保证还清欠款。其中，可以生产自救的有一百五十二户。办法有组织搞副业、养猪、积肥；社分配轻活照顾老弱妇女多参加劳动；还有的在不影响生活的情况下，今年每次预支的时候，扣除一部分钱还社，也有的可用现存余粮余棉归还欠款。有四十六户军官、工作人员、教员、医生的家属，可以用寄回来的薪金、工资归还欠款。另外，还有实在困难、自力无法解决的，由社用公益金救济。
    第三步，确定采用三次预支（春耕的时候、五月节、八月节），两次分配（夏收、秋收），平时不能任意零星借支。按期预支，可以使社员能够有计划地使用每次预支的钱。
    经过这些工作，社员都受到了一次深刻的教育。欠款户表示过去没有想到社的困难，今年一定要好好劳动，把借社的钱还清。
