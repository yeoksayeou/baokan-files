    The Clever Servant
    (Turkic Folk Tale)
    Many years ago, a prince and his son went hunting with their servant. While walking, they both felt very hot, so these two noble hunters took off their armor and clothes and asked the servant to carry these items.
    The prince saw the servant sweating profusely and panting, so he mockingly said:
    "What's wrong? What you are carrying is only what a donkey usually carries!"
    "You are wrong, my lord!" the servant replied, "What I am carrying is the load of two donkeys!"
              Translated by Liu Hua and Yang Guanglu

    聪明的仆人
    （突厥族民间故事）
    很多年以前，一个王爷和他的儿子带着仆人一起打猎去了。走在路上的时候，他们都觉得很热，于是这两位高贵的猎人脱下了盔甲和衣服，并叫仆人背上这些衣物。
    王爷看到仆人热得满身是汗，呼哧呼哧地喘着气，于是他讥笑地说道：
    “怎么了，你身上所背的只不过是一匹驴子通常所负的东西呀！”
    “你错了，我的老爷！”仆人回答说，“我身上所背的是两匹驴子的东西！”
              刘骅、杨光禄译
