    At the Fuzhou School for the Blind
    The Fuzhou School for the Blind is Fujian Province's only institution specifically established for the visually impaired. Over one hundred and sixty blind individuals live here, leading happy lives just like their sighted counterparts. 1. Blind women knit woolen sweaters in the warm sunshine, and they can even knit various exquisite patterns. 2. Blind people can also make many outstanding handicrafts. This is them weaving bamboo shells for thermos bottles. The products are not only of good quality but also beautiful, making it almost unbelievable that the producers of the finished products are people who have lost their sight. 3. The School for the Blind has a variety of Braille reading materials. This blind person is reading the Soviet novel "How the Steel Was Tempered." 4. The cultural and recreational life of the blind is also rich and colorful. Every evening, the sounds of music and singing can be heard everywhere.

    在福州盲人教养院
    福州盲人教养院是福建省唯一的、专门为两眼失明的人而设立的。这里生活着一百六十多位盲人，他们也和健康的人一样过着愉快的生活。1、女盲人在和煦的阳光下编织毛线衣，她们还能织出各种精美的花纹。  2、盲人还会做许多出色的工艺品。这是他们在编制热水瓶的竹壳，产品不只质量好，而且美观，简直使你不敢相信成品的生产者是失去视觉的人们。  3、盲人教养院备有各种盲文读物。这个盲人正在摸读苏联小说“钢铁是怎样炼成的”。  4、盲人的文娱生活也是丰富多彩的，每到黄昏，到处传出琴声、歌声。  林彤摄（新华社稿）
