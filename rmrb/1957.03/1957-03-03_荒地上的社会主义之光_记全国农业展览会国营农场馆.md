The central hall of the National Agricultural Exhibition features a large map showing the distribution of wasteland resources in the motherland. This map tells people that our country has about 1.5 billion mu of wasteland waiting for us to develop and utilize. State-owned farms and ranches, the most advanced socialist agricultural enterprises, have gradually grown from scratch, from small to large, and from few to many on these wastelands.

Since 1948, the People's Government has begun to establish state-owned farms on wasteland. With the attention and support of the Party and the government, the state-owned farm business has gradually developed. According to statistics at the end of 1956, the number of state-owned farms and ranches nationwide had grown to 454, distributed in every corner of the motherland: from Hainan Island to Heilongjiang, from the coast to the north and south of Tianshan; even on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which is more than 3,000 meters above sea level, we can see the light emitted by state-owned farms and ranches.

When talking about the development of state-owned farms in our country, we will never forget the valuable assistance given to us by fraternal countries. In the State-Owned Farm Pavilion, we see the growth process of the State-Owned Friendship Farm and the Sino-Czech Friendship Farm. The State-Owned Friendship Farm, located in Jixian County, Heilongjiang Province, was established in 1954 with the help of Soviet experts, and all the farm's machinery and equipment were donated by the Soviet Union. In 1956, the farm handed over more than 24,700 tons of commercial grain and about 600,000 yuan in profits to the state. The State-Owned Sino-Czech Friendship Farm was built on the saline-alkali wasteland of Huanghua County, Hebei Province, with machinery donated by the Czechoslovak government. Trial planting in 1956 also yielded good harvests. When visiting the exhibits related to these two farms, we are excited to bless these two huge farms, which symbolize the fraternal friendship between the Chinese, Soviet, and Czech people, to flourish and bear fruit on our land!

The various electric charts and red indicators in the Farm Pavilion show us the hard work that the vast number of employees of state-owned farms and ranches have put in over the past few years in their advance towards the Gobi Desert, saline-alkali land, lake depressions, sandy wasteland, red soil, and grasslands. It is these hard-working people who have awakened the wasteland that has been dormant for who knows how many years. In the past few years, state-owned farms and ranches have produced 3 billion jin of grain and 70 million jin of cotton for the country. In 1956, the cultivated land area reached 13.62 million mu, the sown area was 7.76 million mu, and the output of grain was 1.1 billion jin, soybeans 137 million jin, and ginned cotton 290,000 dan. Let's take a look at the colorful agricultural products displayed in the corridor: there are highland barley, broad beans, and rapeseed sent from highland farms, sugarcane, cassava, derris, and sea island cotton sent from subtropical farms, cotton, winter wheat, corn, and safflower sent from the north and south of Tianshan, golden soybeans and spring wheat sent from the Heilongjiang River Basin, as well as pilos deer antlers, ginseng, honey, and many other fruits.

State-owned farms and ranches have also created some national highest unit yield records for the country. You see, the national highest unit area yield record for corn (2,055 jin per mu) and the national highest unit area yield for cotton (1,686 jin per mu) were both created by state-owned farms. The mu yield of spring wheat and winter wheat of state-owned farms exceeding 1,000 jin is no longer a small plot of one or two mu. The average yield per mu of rice and soybeans in state-owned farms nationwide is also higher than the national average yield. Here, according to the order of the exhibits in the State-Owned Farm Pavilion, I record the following figures: the yield per mu of corn is 67% higher than the national average per mu yield, rice is 51% higher, cotton is 84% higher, winter wheat is 67% higher, spring wheat is 37% higher, and soybeans are 13% higher.

Although the proportion of agricultural products produced by state-owned farms in the total national output is still very small, their future development is of extremely great significance. Regarding this point, the Farm Pavilion has calculated several accounts for us: for example, taking the average annual yield of cotton from the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps farms as a calculation, if 50 million mu of cotton are planted in Xinjiang, the output of these cotton fields is equivalent to the output of 100 million mu of cotton fields in the interior. According to preliminary general surveys, Xinjiang has 120 million mu of wasteland; if 40% of it is cultivated for cotton planting, it can produce 892,900 jin of industrial cotton every year. How promising is the future of developing state-owned farms for cotton planting in Xinjiang! The exhibited materials show that if large areas of wasteland in Xinjiang and Heilongjiang are cultivated to plant 30% and 40% of wheat and other grain crops, 16.5 billion jin of commercial grain can be produced annually, which can feed 41.4 million people for one year.

State-owned farms should not only do a good job in production themselves but also help surrounding farmers improve their technology and increase their yields. Here is a touching photo: a farm technician on the plateau is helping Tibetan farmers with grain threshing, guiding them to visit the farm's crops. Another picture is of Mou Xiufen, a cotton-picking expert from the farm, who introduced her experience of picking more than 700 jin of cotton with both hands in one day to the Uyghur brothers. Farms in the Yellow River flooded area have established ties with 60 agricultural cooperatives near the farms, helping them with cultivation and sowing, and have also trained 83 technicians for the cooperatives. Many farms are wholeheartedly helping agricultural cooperatives increase their yields. In 1956, farms nationwide bred 200 million jin of various improved crop varieties for cooperatives, and promoted more than 4,600 heads of improved breeds of sheep and horses. The enthusiastic support of the farms in these areas has made the surrounding farmers regard the farms as schools for learning technology.

Many staff members of state-owned farms attach great importance to the experience of some well-run farms during their visits. Here, the achievements of farms that can make profits in the year of establishment are particularly emphasized. In 1956, there were not just one or two such farms, but many. For example, the Xiting Lake Farm in Hunan Province made a profit of 230,000 yuan in the year of establishment, and the Fengxian Farm in Jiangsu Province also made a profit of 60,000 yuan in the year of establishment. Why can these farms achieve such good results? The exhibited materials show that these farms have implemented the principle of running farms diligently and frugally. Their basic construction work is carried out gradually according to the needs of production, not blindly spreading the stalls. The necessary basic construction work is also carried out on the principle of using local materials and being practical. The non-productive expenses of the farms have been reduced, the costs have been lowered, and the output has been increased, so naturally, production is profitable. In the first year of construction, the basic construction investment of Xidong Lake Farm only accounted for 6%, and 94% of the funds were used for production. Seeing these materials, I remembered that there used to be a "farm losing money theory," and this exhibition refuted this argument with eloquent facts.

One of the important ways to run farms diligently and frugally is to implement diversified operations. Many farms have made good achievements in this regard. The Nan Jiao Farm in Beijing, the Lutai Farm, the Qinghe Farm, the Zhujiang Farm and other farms and ranches introduced by the State-Owned Farm Pavilion, all combine the main business and correspondingly develop animal husbandry, operate fruit trees, vegetables, poultry, fisheries, and use agricultural and livestock products for some processing side businesses, making full use of the available land and water surfaces, producing a variety of products, and achieving profitability in every item. In 1956, the profits of state-owned farms and ranches nationwide reached 48 million yuan, reversing the previous situation of losing money, which is closely related to the fact that many farms have begun to pay attention to diversified operations.

What will the development prospects of state-owned farms and ranches in our country look like? This is a question that everyone visiting the exhibition is very concerned about.

The Farm Pavilion uses large maps, charts, and real objects to introduce the growth process and long-term plan of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps farm group in reclaiming wasteland and building farms in the border areas of the motherland. Now, Xinjiang has 31 state-owned farms and 28 state-owned ranches, reclaiming 3.08 million mu of wasteland. On the grassland on the west bank of the Manas River, a new type of city that completely serves the farms—Shihezi—is rapidly growing. In 1950, there was only one dugout dwelling here, and now it has a population of more than 20,000. This city has processing plants, schools, hospitals, and parks. A huge sand table electric model introduces the plan of the Railway Corps Reclamation Bureau to develop wasteland in the four counties of Mishan, Hulin, Baoqing, and Raohe in Heilongjiang Province. This area has established five general farms and fourteen branch farms, reclaiming 3.7 million mu of land. It is planned to turn all 10 million mu of wasteland into fertile land by 1960. The farm group in this area alone can produce 2 billion to 4 billion jin of grain and 50,000 tons of pork for the country every year.

The face of the vast wasteland of the motherland is being transformed into a rich and lovely granary with the birth and growth of batches of state-owned farms. After the visit, one visitor excitedly wrote: "Every inch of land in the motherland is lovely."

    荒地上的社会主义之光
    ——记全国农业展览会国营农场馆
    小余
    全国农业展览会的中央大厅里，悬挂着一幅宽大的祖国荒地资源分布示意图。这幅地图告诉人们，我国有十五亿亩左右的荒地正等待我们去开发利用。国营农场、牧场，这些最先进的社会主义的农业企业，就是在这些荒地上，从无到有，从小到大，从少到多，逐步生长起来的。
    从1948年起，人民政府就开始在荒地上建立国营农场。国营农场事业在党和政府的重视与扶持下，逐步发展。到1956年底统计，全国国营农、牧场已经发展到了四百五十四个，分布在祖国的每一个角落：从海南岛到黑龙江，从大海之滨到天山南北；就是在海拔三千公尺以上的青藏高原上，也会看到国营农、牧场放出的光芒。
    在谈到我国国营农场的发展的时候，我们永远不会忘记兄弟国家给予我国的珍贵的援助。在国营农场馆里，我们就看到国营友谊农场和中捷友谊农场的成长过程。位于黑龙江省集贤县的国营友谊农场，是1954年起在苏联专家的帮助下建立起来的，农场的全套机器设备都是苏联赠送的。1956年这个农场上缴的商品粮食有两万四千七百多吨，上缴利润六十万元左右。国营中捷友谊农场是用捷克斯洛伐克政府赠送的机具，在河北省黄骅县的盐碱荒地上建立起来的。1956年试种，也得到良好的收成。在参观有关这两个农场的展品的时候，我们怀着兴奋的心情，祝福着这两个标志着中苏、中捷人民兄弟友谊的巨大农场，在我国的土地上繁盛地开花结果！
    农场馆的各种电动图表、红色的指标，向我们指出国营农、牧场的广大职工，几年来在向戈壁滩、盐碱地、湖洼地、沙荒、红壤和草原进军中所付出的辛勤劳动。就是这些勤劳的人们，使得沉睡了不知多少年的荒地开始苏醒了。几年来国营农、牧场已经为国家生产了三十亿斤粮食、七千万斤棉花。1956年耕地面积达到一千三百六十二万亩，播种七百七十六万亩，生产粮食十一亿斤，大豆一亿三千七百万斤，皮棉二十九万担。我们看看长廊上陈列着的五光十色的农产品吧：这里有高原农场送来的青稞、胡豆、油菜，有亚热带农场送来的甘蔗、木薯、鱼藤、海岛棉，有从天山南北送来的棉花、冬小麦、玉米、红花，有从黑龙江流域送来的金黄的大豆、春小麦，有鹿茸、人参、蜂蜜，此外还有很多果品。
    国营农牧场还为国家创造了一些全国最高单位产量纪录。你看，全国玉米最高单位面积产量纪录（每亩二千零五十五斤）、棉花全国最高单位面积产量（每亩一千六百八十六斤），都是国营农场创造的。国营农场的春小麦、冬小麦亩产千斤以上的，已经不是一两亩的小块地了。全国国营农场的水稻、大豆的每亩平均产量也比全国平均产量高。这里按照国营农场馆的展品的顺序，记下下面几个数字：玉米每亩产量比全国平均每亩产量高67％，水稻高51％，棉花高84％，冬小麦高67％，春小麦高37％，大豆高13％。
    虽然国营农场的农产品产量在全国总产量中所占的比重还很小，但是，它们的未来的发展，却具有极其重大的意义。关于这点，农场馆为我们算了几笔账：比如，拿新疆军垦农场的棉花常年平均产量来计算，如果在新疆种棉花五千万亩，这些棉田的产量就相当于内地一亿亩棉田的产量。据初步概查，新疆有一亿二千万亩的荒地；如果开垦以后用40％来植棉，每年可产工业用棉八十九万二千九百斤。新疆发展国营农场植棉业的前程多么远大！展出的材料说明，如果把新疆、黑龙江的大片荒地开垦出来种植30％和40％的麦类和其他谷类作物，每年可产商品粮食一百六十五亿斤，可供四千一百四十万人食用一年。
    国营农场不仅要自己搞好生产，还要帮助周围农民改进技术，提高产量。这里有一张动人的照片：高原上的农场技术员正在帮助藏族农民进行谷物脱粒工作，引导他们参观农场的庄稼。又一张图片是农场拾棉能手牟秀芬的，她把一天双手拾棉花七百多斤的经验，介绍给维吾尔族的兄弟。黄泛区农场跟农场附近六十个农业合作社建立了联系，帮助它们代耕代播，而且还为合作社培养了八十三名技术员，很多农场都是在尽心地帮助农业社提高产量。1956年全国农场就为合作社繁殖了二亿斤的各种作物优良品种，推广优良的种羊、种马四千六百多头。农场在这些方面的热情支援，使得周围的农民把农场当成学习技术的学校。
    许多国营农场的工作人员在参观中非常重视一些办得较好的农场的经验。这里特别着重介绍了建场当年就能获利的农场的成绩。在1956年，这种农场已经不是一个两个，而是很多个。像湖南西庭湖农场建场当年就盈利二十三万元，江苏奉贤农场建场当年也盈利六万元。为什么这些场能够做出这样良好的成绩呢？展览的材料表明，这些农场贯彻执行了勤俭办场的方针。它们的基本建设工作是随着生产的需要逐步进行的，不是盲目地铺摊子。必需的基本建设工作，也是本着就地取材、切合实用的原则进行的。农场非生产性费用减少了，成本降低了，产量提高了，自然就做到了生产有利。西洞湖农场建场第一年基本建设投资只占6％，94％的资金用到生产中去。看到这些材料，我想起从前曾经有一种“农场赔钱论”，这个展览会用雄辩的事实驳倒了这种论调。
    勤俭办场的重要办法之一，是实行多种经营。很多农场在这方面做出了良好的成绩。国营农场馆所介绍的北京市南郊农场、芦台农场、清河农场、珠江农场等农牧场，都是结合主业，相应地发展畜牧业，经营果树、蔬菜、家禽、渔业，和利用农、畜产品进行的一些加工副业，尽力利用了可以利用的土地和水面，生产了多种多样的产品，做到项项有利。1956年全国国营农、牧场的盈利达四千八百万元，扭转了过去赔钱的局面，这同许多农场开始注意了多种经营有密切关系。
    我国国营农、牧场的发展远景将是什么样子？这是每个参观展览会的人都十分关心的问题。
    农场馆用了大幅的地图、图表和实物，来介绍新疆军垦农场群，在祖国的边疆开荒建场的成长过程和远景规划。现在新疆已有三十一个国营农场，二十八个国营牧场，开垦荒地三百零八万亩。在玛纳斯河西岸的草原上，一个完全为农场服务的新型城市——石河子，正在迅速地成长着。1950年这里只有一间地窝子，现在它已拥有两万多人口了。这个城市里有加工厂，有学校、医院和公园。一个巨大的沙盘电动模型，介绍了铁道兵农垦局在黑龙江省密山、虎林、宝清、饶河四县地区的开发荒地的规划。这个地区已经建立了五个总场、十四个分场，开垦了三百七十万亩土地。计划到1960年把一千万亩的荒地全部变为良田。光是这个地区的农场群，到那时就可以每年给国家生产粮食二十亿到四十亿斤、猪肉五万吨。
    祖国的广阔的荒地的面貌，正在随着一批批国营农场的诞生和成长，而变成富饶可爱的谷仓。一个参观者在参观以后兴奋地写下了这样一句话：“祖国的每一寸土地都是可爱的。”
