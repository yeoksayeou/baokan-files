Increase Production and Practice Economy and Production Plans
    Wu Lü

It would be hard to believe anyone who said, "Grasping the campaign to increase production and practice economy actually makes it impossible to complete the production plan." But, it "actually happened."

This happened at the Qingdao Pesticide Factory. The factory was very strict in grasping the campaign to increase production and practice economy. Meetings were held frequently, and they were very long. Once, an enlarged cadre meeting was held to discuss the campaign to increase production and practice economy. They sat down after dinner and didn't adjourn until 7:00 a.m. the next morning. But what about production? It was terrible! In January and February, they failed to complete the plan for two consecutive months, producing one hundred tons less of sodium fluoride and wasting four hundred and fifty tons more of coal.

What was the reason? Could it be that the campaign to increase production and practice economy really contradicts the completion of the production plan? Of course not. Carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy is precisely to comprehensively complete the production plan, and comprehensively completing the production plan requires carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy. This is a well-known truth. So, why did the Qingdao Pesticide Factory fail to complete the production plan after grasping the campaign to increase production and practice economy? The reason is also very simple: they themselves forcibly separated the campaign to increase production and practice economy from the completion of the production plan.

Look! This is how they carried out the campaign to increase production and practice economy: they brought the cadres to meetings, one after another, working behind closed doors to develop plans. Also, they endlessly argued about issues that could be resolved with a serious investigation. The issue of coal ash disposal was discussed five times. Should the coal ash be contracted to porters, or should they buy a truck and hire people to haul it? They argued back and forth without a result. And what about the daily production issues? They didn't study them properly. In January, when manufacturing sodium fluoride, they changed to a new raw material. They should have analyzed it and re-studied the formula, but no one cared. The result was a new raw material with an old formula, and the sodium fluoride content in the semi-finished product was significantly reduced, making it impossible to extract the finished product, and the output dropped by nearly half.

Thinking about it carefully, there are quite a few things like this. Every time a campaign comes, there are always some "contradictionists with production," who either stand still or put production a thousand miles away, closing their doors to develop plans, working day and night. Although they are working hard, the problem lies here.

All work in the factory, directly or indirectly, is for the purpose of improving production; even some work that doesn't touch on production directly always strives not to affect production. The campaign to increase production and practice economy is different from these tasks. It is production itself. Potential comes from production; the results are manifested in production. To carry out the campaign to increase production and practice economy, we must closely focus on production, especially on the key issues in production. Leaving production, especially leaving the key issues in production, and engaging in increasing production and practicing economy in isolation, although it is possible to squeeze out a little "profit" here and there, it is a loss if production is not done well.

The Qingdao Pesticide Factory's practice of ignoring production and engaging in increasing production and practicing economy in isolation has not seen any "gain," but the "loss" is considerable. I hope the Qingdao Pesticide Factory will change it, and other factories will take warning.

### 增产节约和生产计划

    增产节约和生产计划
    吴滤
    若说：“抓了增产节约运动，反而完不成生产计划”，是不会有人相信的。但，竟“确有其事”。
    这事发生在青岛农药厂。厂里对开展增产节约运动是抓得很紧的。经常开会，而且次数很多，时间很长。有一次召开扩大干部会议讨论增产节约运动，从吃过晚饭坐下来，一直开到第二天早上七点才散会。可是，生产呢？糟得很！1、2月份连续两个月没有完成计划，少产了一百吨氟化钠，多费了四百五十吨煤炭。
    原因何在呢？莫非开展增产节约运动真同完成生产计划有矛盾吗？当然不是。开展增产节约运动正是为了全面完成生产计划，全面完成生产计划必须开展增产节约运动，这是众所周知的道理。那么，青岛农药厂为什么抓了增产节约运动，反而完不成生产计划呢？原因也很简单：他们自己硬把增产节约运动同完成生产计划割裂开来。
    看！他们是这样开展增产节约运动的：把干部找来开会，一个接着一个，闭门搞方案。还有，就是不停息的争论一些只要认真调查一下就可以解决的问题。一个煤灰的处理问题，前后讨论了五次。是把煤灰包给搬运工人拉，还是自己买车雇人拉？争来争去，没有结果。而日常生产上的问题呢？却没有好好的研究。1月份，制造氟化钠换了新原料，理应化验分析，重新研究配方，却没有人管。结果是新原料旧配方，半成品中氟化钠含量显著降低，提炼不出成品来，产量下降了近一半。
    这类事，细想起来还不少。每来一次运动，总有一些“同生产矛盾论者”，或则按兵不动，或则置生产于千里之外，关起门来搞方案，通宵达旦，夜以继日，虽然辛苦，毛病也就出在这儿。
    工厂里的工作，直接间接的，都是为了搞好生产；有些工作，虽然挨不上生产的边，也总力求不影响生产。增产节约运动同这些工作不同，它本身就是生产，潜力，从生产中来；结果，表现在生产中。要开展增产节约运动，就要紧紧围绕着生产，特别是围绕着生产中的关键问题行动。离开了生产，特别是离开了生产中的关键问题，孤立地搞增产节约，虽然也可以从这里哪里挤出一点“油水”来，但生产搞不好，是得不偿失的。
    青岛农药厂撇开生产，孤立地搞增产节约运动的做法，还不见有所“得”，“失”却可观。愿青岛农药厂改之，别的工厂戒之。
