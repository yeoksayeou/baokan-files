Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 22nd: According to the Czechoslovak News Agency, the Czechoslovak National Front issued an announcement on the 21st regarding the election of People's Committees (local organs of state power) scheduled for May 19th this year.

The announcement stated that during the period of preparation for the People's Committee elections, the important resolutions made by the National Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party are being implemented into practical life. Socialist democracy is being greatly strengthened and deepened throughout the country, the legal system is also being greatly strengthened, and the powers and responsibilities of the People's Committees are being further expanded and deepened. Therefore, the National Front organizations at all levels will nominate candidates for the People's Committees from among the most outstanding workers, who will prove their abilities in the process of serving the people and their determination to further implement the tasks of socialist construction.

The announcement called on everyone to unanimously support the candidates nominated by the National Front—the most outstanding sons and daughters from the ranks of workers, peasants, and intellectuals. It said that the strength and invincible source of our people's democratic system lies in the unity of all the people within the National Front led by the Czechoslovak Communist Party.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, March 21st: The meeting of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak National Front opened in Prague on the 20th. The meeting will study the issue of the People's Committee elections scheduled for May 19th.

The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the National Front, Antonín Novotný, delivered a long speech at the meeting.

In his speech, he focused on the task of greatly increasing the enthusiasm of the working people in participating in management and gave a high evaluation of the work of the People's Committees, pointing out their achievements and shortcomings.

When talking about the principles of the National Front, Novotný said: The public organizations of the working people and the various parties other than the Communist Party voluntarily recognize the leading position of the Czechoslovak Communist Party in the National Front. The Czechoslovak Communist Party has achieved the position of leading the country because it has unswervingly fought to safeguard the rights of the working people and improve their lives, and because it follows the doctrine of Marxism-Leninism. Our people's democratic system is built on this principle, and we will never retreat from this principle.

Finally, Novotný emphasized the great responsibility of the entire National Front in electing candidates. He expressed his conviction that the elections of the People's Committees, as in the past, will once again prove the complete unity of all the people, prove their determination to complete new tasks in socialist construction, and demonstrate the further consolidation of the people's democratic system.

　　诺沃提尼号召提高劳动人民参加管理的积极性
    据新华社布拉格22日电　据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社报道，捷克斯洛伐克民族阵线21日就定于今年5月19日举行的人民委员会（地方国家权力机关）选举发表了一项公告。
    公告说，在准备人民委员会选举的这个时期里，捷克斯洛伐克共产党全国代表会议所作出的重要决议正在贯彻到实际生活中去。社会主义民主正在全国各地得到大大的加强和加深，法制也得到大大的加强，人民委员会的权限和责任正在进一步扩大和加深。因此，民族阵线各级组织将从最优秀的工作者中提出人民委员会的候选人，这些人将在为人民服务的过程中证明自己的才能和进一步贯彻实现社会主义建设任务的决心。
    公告号召大家一致支持民族阵线所提出的候选人——工人、农民、知识分子队伍中的最优秀的儿女。它说，我们人民民主制度的力量和不可战胜的泉源，就在于捷克斯洛伐克共产党所领导的民族阵线内的全体人民的团结。
    据新华社布拉格21日电　捷克斯洛伐克民族阵线中央委员会会议20日在布拉格开幕。会议将研究定于5月19日举行的人民委员会选举问题。
    共产党中央委员会第一书记、民族阵线中央委员会主席团委员安·诺沃提尼在会上发表了长篇讲话。
    他在讲话中着重地谈到了大大提高劳动人民在参加管理方面的积极性的任务并且对人民委员会的工作作了很高的评价，指出了它们的工作成绩和缺点。
    诺沃提尼在谈到民族阵线的原则的时候说：劳动人民的公共团体和共产党以外的各政党，都自愿地承认捷克斯洛伐克共产党在民族阵线中的领导地位，捷克斯洛伐克共产党取得领导国家的地位，是由于它坚持不渝地为维护劳动人民的权利并且改善他们的生活而进行斗争，因为它是遵循马克思列宁主义的学说的。我们的人民民主制度就是建立在这种原则上的，我们决不在这种原则上退却。
    诺沃提尼最后着重地谈到了整个民族阵线在选举候选人方面的重大责任，他表示确信，人民委员会的选举将要同过去一样地再一次证明全体人民完全团结一致，证明他们决心完成社会主义建设中的新任务，并且表明人民民主制度的进一步巩固。
