Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd dispatch from Bermuda: On the second day of the U.S.-British government heads' meeting, a U.S. spokesperson announced that the U.S. had notified Britain of its willingness to participate in the Baghdad Pact's military committee. The U.S. had previously joined the pact's economic committee.

White House Press Secretary Hagerty said at a press conference on the 22nd that the U.S. decision was "a natural development" of the "Eisenhower Doctrine."

Hagerty also emphasized that the U.S. decision does not mean that the U.S. is now a formal member state of the Baghdad Pact. Local observers believe this is a gesture to ease the opposition of Arab countries.

Yesterday's bilateral talks were conducted in two parts. In the morning, the foreign ministers of the two countries held talks, and in the afternoon, the heads of government held talks. Dulles and Lloyd mainly discussed European issues in the morning talks, including so-called European integration, the Common Market and Free Trade Area, the European Atomic Energy Community, German unification, the withdrawal of British troops from Western Europe, and the situation in the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries.

The two foreign ministers also briefly discussed the Far East issue, the embargo issue, and the China issue in the morning. U.S. spokesman Bedell said that the "exchange of views on these issues has ended." He said that the United States has not changed its attitude towards the People's Republic of China. It was reported that "no positive conclusions were reached" on the embargo issue either.

According to Western news agencies, the afternoon talks discussed the issue of the United States supplying Britain with "fully equipped" atomic rockets and exchanging rocket weapons intelligence, as well as West Germany's role in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Agence France-Presse said that Eisenhower "advised" Macmillan in the talks to "proceed with caution" on the issue of withdrawing troops from Western Europe.

Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd dispatch from New York: The "New York Times" pointed out on the 22nd, in its commentary on the Bermuda U.S.-British summit, that the readjustment of relations between the two countries is for the strength of the United States to fill the weakening of British strength.

The "New York Times" said that the decline of British power "has been compensated by the astonishing growth of American power, and even surpassed it." The newspaper said that because of this shift in power, it requires "a major psychological and practical readjustment" in U.S.-British relations.

The newspaper concluded by saying that one of the main issues discussed at the Bermuda conference was "whether the United States can further increase its strength and obligations to continue to make up for this weakening."

    美国宣布参加巴格达条约军事委员会
    “纽约时报”说美国要填补英国被削弱的地位
    据新华社23日讯　百慕大消息：在美英政府首脑会谈的第二天，美国发言人宣布，美国通知英国，美国愿意参加巴格达条约的军事委员会。美国在这以前参加了这个条约的经济委员会。
    白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂在22日的记者招待会上说，美国的决定是“艾森豪威尔主义”的“一种必然的发展”。
    哈格蒂又着重说，美国的这一决定并不意味着美国现在已经是巴格达条约的正式成员国。当地观察家认为，这是为了缓和阿拉伯国家的反对而作出的姿态。
    昨天的两国会谈是分两部分进行的。上午由两国外交部长举行会谈，下午举行政府首脑会谈。杜勒斯和劳埃德在上午会谈中主要讨论了欧洲问题，其中包括所谓欧洲整体化、共同市场和自由贸易区、欧洲原子能联营组织、德国统一、英国从西欧大陆撤军以及苏联和东欧国家的局势问题。
    两国外长在上午还简短讨论了远东问题，禁运问题和中国问题。美国发言人贝丁说，关于这些问题的“意见交换已经结束了”。他说，美国没有改变它对中华人民共和国采取的态度。据报道，在禁运问题上双方也“没有得出任何积极的结论”。
    据西方通讯社透露，下午会谈中讨论了由美国供给英国“装备齐全”的原子火箭及交换火箭武器情报的问题，以及西德在北大西洋公约组织中的作用。法新社说，艾森豪威尔在会谈中“劝告”麦克米伦在从西欧大陆撤军问题上要“谨慎从事”。
    据新华社23日讯　纽约消息：“纽约时报”22日在评论百慕大英美首脑会议的时候指出，两国关系的重新调整就是要由美国的力量来填补英国力量的削弱。
    “纽约时报”说，英国力量的衰落“已经由于美国力量的惊人增长而得到弥补，而且只有过之而无不及”。这家报纸说，由于这种力量的转移，它就要求英美关系上“有必要作重大的心理上和实际上的重新调整”。
    报纸最后说，百慕大会议讨论的主要问题之一就是“美国能否进一步增加自己的力量和义务来继续弥补这种削弱”。
