Xinhua News Agency, Accra, March 5th: Ghanaian Prime Minister Nkrumah said on the 4th that Ghana will continue to participate in the Commonwealth as long as the Commonwealth continues to maintain its policy of resolving common problems. Prior to this, the Commonwealth countries had already agreed to Ghana becoming a member state of the Commonwealth.

Xinhua News Agency, Accra, March 5th: Ghanaian Prime Minister Nkrumah received U.S. Vice President Nixon on the 4th and had a 35-minute conversation.

Nixon arrived in Accra on the 3rd to attend Ghana's independence ceremony. According to the Associated Press, Nixon, who was recovering from a severe cold, tried to meet with Nkrumah ahead of the British chief representative Butler to discuss Ghana's future policies.

On the same day, Nixon said at a press conference held at the U.S. Consulate that Ghana will formulate a policy of "never accepting foreign rule from any side," and its policy "will be national, but not neutral." Nixon said: "This can indicate the direction to be followed when other African countries gain independence."

Nixon also said that he had expressed to Nkrumah the United States' willingness to provide technical assistance to Ghana in order to build a large hydroelectric power plant on the Volta River.

    加纳总理谈同英联邦关系问题
    尼克松抢在巴特勒头前会见恩克鲁马
    据新华社5日讯　阿克拉消息：加纳总理恩克鲁马4日说，只要英联邦继续保持解决共同问题的政策，加纳将继续参加英联邦。在这之前，英联邦各国已经同意加纳为英联邦的成员国。
    据新华社5日讯　阿克拉消息：加纳总理恩克鲁马4日接见了美国副总统尼克松，并且作了三十五分钟的谈话。
    尼克松是在3日到达阿克拉参加加纳独立典礼的。据美联社说，患重伤风刚好的尼克松是想法子抢在英国首席代表巴特勒头里去和恩克鲁马谈论加纳今后的政策的。
    当天，尼克松在美国领事馆举行的记者招待会上说，加纳将制订“决不接受来自任何方面的外国统治的”政策，它的政策“将是民族的，但是不是中立的”。尼克松说：“这可以表示出在其他非洲国家获得独立时所要遵循的方向。”
    尼克松还说，他已经向恩克鲁马表示美国愿意向加纳提供技术援助，以便在佛尔塔河上建造一个巨大的水电厂。
