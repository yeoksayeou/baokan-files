Breaking the Ice to Rescue Fishing Boats
		Pan Xiaochen

Late at night, the northwest wind howled across Jiaozhou Bay. Waves rose and fell on the sea. At this moment, a small艇 (tǐng - small boat) moored in the harbor suddenly left the dock, riding the wind and waves straight towards the west. The merciless wind and waves attacked the艇's hull, with waves crashing against the bow one after another. The艇 would climb the crest of a wave for a moment, then slide into the trough.

This was a minesweeper艇 of a certain naval unit, now under orders to complete an urgent mission. Two days earlier, three small fishing boats had sailed into the bay near Cangkou Bay to seek shelter from the wind, but the weather turned cold, the wind picked up, and the sea froze over, trapping the three fishing boats in ice. This naval minesweeper艇 was sailing out overnight to rescue these fishing boats.

The minesweeper艇 stubbornly forged ahead through the waves. Splashes of water froze into a thin layer of ice on the deck. Standing on the command platform was a young officer, Li Danxiu, a lieutenant in the navy and the squadron leader of the minesweeper艇 unit. Seven years ago, he was just an ordinary soldier in the army, but now he was a commanding officer capable of skillfully operating naval vessels. He held binoculars and searched the sea ahead.

After more than thirty minutes of high-speed sailing, the minesweeper艇 spotted a vast expanse of white ice. Then, within this ice area, they spotted three small black dots. Lieutenant Li Danxiu immediately ordered: "Target black dots, full speed ahead!"

The艇 continued to advance. The sailors saw that they were indeed fishing boats, and they couldn't wait to rush forward.

However, at this moment, the艇 began to move in a serpentine path, swerving from left to right. The waves churned up by the propeller left a winding white trail behind the艇. "What's going on? Is there something wrong with the艇?"

Lieutenant Li Danxiu immediately told the艇长 (tǐng zhǎng - boat captain) to stay on deck and rushed to the rudder room. It turned out that the helmsman was a new recruit who had not been in the service for long. When he saw the minesweeper艇 approaching the ice area, he didn't know what to do and panicked, losing control of the rudder. Lieutenant Li Danxiu immediately took the helm himself and steered straight toward the location of the fishing boats, advancing rapidly.

This minesweeper艇 was not an icebreaker, but rescuing the fishermen was of paramount importance, and the officers and men on board had to navigate carefully. Now that they had entered the ice area, they became even more tense.

The ice layer grew thicker and thicker. The艇 used the momentum of its bow to break through the ice and create a channel, advancing slowly. But the艇's movements became more and more difficult, and ice floes crashed against the hull with a rustling sound. Lieutenant Li Danxiu held the rudder with both hands, scanning for thinner areas of ice, sometimes detouring, sometimes advancing in a straight line. Finally, they were close to the fishing boats. Logically, at this point, the people on the fishing boats, if they were still alive, should have come out to greet them. But the fishing boats remained quietly sealed in the ice, with no smoke and no voices. This situation made the sailors realize that an urgent rescue was needed. Li Danxiu thought, "If we can get on board the fishing boats just one minute sooner, perhaps the fishermen who have been freezing and starving for two days and two nights can be saved!" The officers and men on board were all anxious.

The engine roared, and the minesweeper艇 broke through the ice and approached the fishing boats.

Suddenly, the engine of the minesweeper艇 emitted a strange "wuwu" sound and stopped running. The艇's hull was stuck in an ice hole, unable to move.

The engine room soldiers busied themselves in the engine room. After a thorough inspection, they found that the seawater intake pipe and filter were blocked by ice. Without seawater passing through, the engine overheated and could not start.

The engine room soldiers rolled up their sleeves and began to dig out the ice with their hands. When their fingers went numb, they used bowls to scoop it out, and then they used boiling water to flush it away. Finally, the engine started running again. The minesweeper艇 continued to advance.

The minesweeper艇 had to clear ice every few meters to move forward.

Finally, as the east began to lighten, the minesweeper艇 had opened a long waterway in the icy sea, approaching the fishing boats. At this moment, several people suddenly appeared on the fishing boats, waving their clothes and hats. The officers and men on the minesweeper艇 were overjoyed. They immediately waved back and shouted to the fishermen, cupping their hands to their mouths, "Fishermen brothers! We're coming!"

They were very close now, but the艇's bow suddenly plunged into a foot-thick layer of ice. Although the engine was still "dududu" jumping, the艇 could not move forward at all. At this time, the soldiers all pitched in, forgetting the cold and the danger. They climbed onto the rails of the minesweeper艇 and used the bamboo poles and simple tools they had brought with them to break the ice and move forward.

The ice was broken through. As the fishing boats approached the艇's rail, more than a dozen pairs of sailors' hands reached down from the艇. The seven fishermen from the three fishing boats were rescued. Their faces were frozen purple, and they hadn't eaten for two days and two nights. As soon as an old fisherman in his forties was pulled onto the deck, before he could even stand firmly, radioman Yang Keping immediately draped his leather coat over the old fisherman's shoulders. In the galley of the minesweeper艇, the sailors were busy making ginger soup for the fishermen. When the fishermen saw these sailors, their eyes filled with tears of gratitude, and they were speechless.

The minesweeper艇 towed the three fishing boats back. But it didn't go smoothly. Before they had gone far, a piece of ice overturned the last fishing boat, and then the second fishing boat also capsized.

As the soldiers righted the fishing boats, the ice tightly surrounded the minesweeper艇 again. The tide was gradually receding, and the艇's waterline finally climbed above the surface of the sea. The hull of the艇 tilted to the right, and the minesweeper艇 ran aground.

At this moment, the radioman immediately appeared on the command platform. He reported to Lieutenant Li Danxiu, "The base is sending a telegram asking if we need to send a艇 to assist us?" Hearing these words, Li Danxiu pondered deeply, not uttering a word. He thought, "We came out to rescue people, how can we ask others to rescue us again? No, we can't." He looked at the sea and ordered the radioman to reply to the base, "No rescue is needed for the time being." Not long after, the tide rose. The minesweeper艇 floated up, carrying the three fishing boats, and steamed towards the base, breaking the waves.

    破冰救渔船
    潘晓晨
    深夜，胶州湾西北风呼呼地吹着。海面上波浪起伏。这时，在海港上停着的一艘小艇突然离开了码头，乘风破浪直向西面飞驶而去。风浪无情地向这艘小艇的艇身袭击，浪头一个接着一个猛扑着艇首。艇一会爬上浪峰，一会滑进浪窝。
    这是海军某部的一艘扫雷艇，现在奉命去完成一项紧急任务。两天前，在沧口湾附近的海面上，有三只小渔船因为避风驶进湾内，谁知天冷风大，海面结冰，三只小渔船被冰封住了。海军的这艘扫雷艇就是连夜出海去营救这些渔船的。
    扫雷艇顽强地破浪前进。浪花打在甲板上结了一层薄冰。站在指挥台上的是一位年轻的军官，他是扫雷艇队中队长李丹修海军中尉。七年前，他还是陆军的一个普通战士，现在已经是能够熟练操纵舰艇的指挥军官了。他拿着望远镜向海面的前方搜索着。
    扫雷艇破浪飞驶了三十多分钟以后，发现了白茫茫的一片冰区。接着，就在这冰区中又发现了三个小黑点。李丹修海军中尉立即命令：“目标黑点，快速前进！”
    艇在继续前进。水兵们看到果然是渔船，他们都恨不得马上赶上前去。
    可是，就在这时，艇却忽左忽右走成蛇形道了。螺旋桨掀起的浪花在艇后留了一条弯弯曲曲的白色尾巴。“这是怎回事呢？是否艇出了故障？”
    李丹修海军中尉立即叫艇长留在上面，自己赶到舵房。原来操舵的是个入伍不久的新兵，他看到扫雷艇快驶进冰区，不知如何才好，心里一慌，操舵就不稳了。李丹修海军中尉马上亲自操舵，对准了渔船所在，急速前进。
    这艘扫雷艇并不是破冰船，但是，营救渔民要紧，艇上官兵不得不小心谨慎地操艇前往。现在进入冰区了，他们更加紧张起来。
    冰层越来越厚，艇借着艇首的冲力冲破冰层开辟着航道，缓缓前进。但艇的行动越来越困难，冰块撞击着艇身沙沙作响。李丹修海军中尉两手操舵，两眼寻找着冰薄的地方，一会儿绕道穿行，一会儿直线前进。好容易，现在快接近渔船了。按理，这时候，渔船上的人，如果还活着，是应该出来打招呼的。但是，渔船静静地封在冰里，没有烟火，没有人声。这情况，使水兵们预感到需要紧急前往救援。李丹修想：“如果能早一分钟登上渔船，也许冻饿了两天两夜的渔民能够得救！”艇上官兵都焦急着。
    机器怒吼起来，扫雷艇冲破冰层向渔船靠近。
    突然，扫雷艇的发动机发出一阵“唔唔”的怪声后，停止了跳动。艇身卡在冰窟窿里，一动也不能动了。
    轮机兵们在机舱里忙碌起来，经过一番详细检查，原来是通海水的管子和过滤器都被冰块堵死了。机器没有海水通过，就发生高热，不能开动。
    轮机兵们就卷起袖子，用手扒冰块。手指头麻木了，就用碗舀，以后又用开水来冲。终于，机器跳动起来。扫雷艇继续前进。
    扫雷艇每前进几公尺就得排一次冰，才能前进。
    直到东方发白的时候，扫雷艇终于在冰海上开出一条长长的水道，向渔船靠近。这时，渔船上突然出现了几个人，还不时地挥动着衣帽。扫雷艇上的官兵们高兴极了，他们立即招着手，用手卷成一个筒向渔民喊道：“渔民兄弟们！我们就来！”
    相距已经很近了，艇首突然钻进了一尺多厚的一个冰层里。机器尽管还是一个劲儿“嘟嘟嘟”地跳动，艇却丝毫也不能前进。这时，水兵们便一起动手，他们忘记了寒冷和危险，爬在扫雷艇的艇舷，用艇上带着的几根竹杆和一些简单工具破冰前进。
    冰块打通了。当渔船接近艇舷时，从艇上伸下了十几双水兵的手，三只渔船上的七个渔民被救上来了。他们脸色冻得发紫，两天两夜没有吃饭了。一个四十多岁的老渔民刚被拉上甲板，还没有站稳，报务员杨克平便首先把自己的皮大衣披到这个老渔民身上。在扫雷艇的伙房里，水兵们在忙着给渔民做姜汤。渔民们见到这些水兵们，眼里含着无限感激的泪花，顿时说不出一句话来。
    扫雷艇拖着三条渔船返航了。但是并不顺利，没走多远，一块冰把最后一只渔船顶翻了，接着第二只渔船也翻了个。
    当水兵们扶正渔船时，冰块又把扫雷艇紧紧包围起来。海潮逐渐在下落，艇的吃水线终于爬上了海面，艇身向右倾斜，扫雷艇搁浅了。
    这时，报务员立即出现在指挥台前，他向李丹修海军中尉报告：“基地来电报询问是否要派艇来援助？”李丹修听了这话，凝神沉思，一言未发。他想：“我们是出来救人的，怎能再叫别人来救我们呢。不，不能。”他看了看海面，命令报务员回报给基地：“暂时不需营救。”不多时，涨潮了。扫雷艇浮起来，带着三条渔船，向基地破浪驶去。
