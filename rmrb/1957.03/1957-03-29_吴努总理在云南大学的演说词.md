Yunnan University students:

　　I have long been looking forward to an opportunity like today to meet with you all, so I am very happy about today's meeting. For this, first of all, let me express my sincere thanks to the Yunnan University authorities for arranging this meeting opportunity today.

　　I would like to take this opportunity to say a few words to you all. Your People's Republic of China and our Union of Burma have one thing in common, and that is: the masses of people in both our countries have only recently gained sovereignty over creating their own destiny.

　　Therefore, what I want to say to you students of Yunnan University today is also what I often say to the students of my country. I hope you will keep this in mind first.

　　In the near future, you will become leaders leading the construction of your motherland. And as a future leader, you must possess at least three qualities, which are:

　　1. Possess sufficient working ability;

　　2. Be selfless;

　　3. Be loyal and honest.

　　After graduating from university, you will become engineers, doctors, scientists, mechanics, educators, military officers, judges, administrative officers, lawyers, politicians, etc. That is to say, you will serve as leaders in all aspects of the country. When you become leaders, you can serve the masses of people according to your ability. Leaders with weak working ability can only do very little work for the masses, while those with strong working ability can do more for the masses.

　　Let us take engineers as an example: Engineers with weak working ability can only be used to build small one- or two-story buildings, small factories that only employ a dozen people, and small bridges over small rivers. However, to build large workers' cultural palaces, government office buildings, large exhibition halls, large factories that can employ three or four thousand workers, and large bridges spanning rivers and mountains, only engineers with strong working ability can be competent. Therefore, if you are willing to do more work for the masses of people, then you must work hard to enrich your working ability.

　　When you first graduate from university, you cannot be said to possess all the necessary working abilities; you must continue to work hard and constantly improve your working abilities after graduating from university. However, the education you receive in university is an important foundation for you. When building a building, if the foundation is not solid, no matter how good the building above is, it will collapse soon. Similarly, when you study courses like the foundation of a building in university, if you do not study hard, then your life will be like a building with an unstable foundation. Therefore, just as the Burmese proverb says: "Strike while the iron is hot," I sincerely hope that you will take advantage of this good opportunity to receive higher education in university and study hard.

　　Here, I would like to deeply draw your attention to an important issue regarding working ability. It is not enough for you to just study hard the various courses prescribed by the university; you should also strive to learn to get along well with people around you who are higher in position than you, equal in position to you, or lower in position than you. People with excellent academic performance but who do not get along well with the people around them cannot be called people with sufficient working ability. You will see many such people in the world: although they are very knowledgeable, they cannot obtain personal benefits or serve the interests of the majority because they do not do well in getting along with people. In order to prevent you from becoming such people, I hope that you will start now to intensify your efforts in this area.

　　The university is a place of learning for people from all over the country. Therefore, you must strive to get along in harmony with the people you come into contact with every day! When you work hard in this way, the experience and knowledge you gain will be very helpful to you when you graduate from university and go to society to get along with the masses.

　　So much for the issue of working ability. Now I will briefly talk about the second condition—the issue of being selfless. The progress and prosperity of a country depends first and foremost on the people of that country. Therefore, if the people of a country do not see the interests of the country but only see their own personal interests, then there is no hope for this country. Such a country will never progress no matter what, and it will surely decline. Therefore, if you are willing to see your motherland catch up with the advanced countries in the world in the near future, I sincerely hope that you will thoroughly eliminate the bad idea of only thinking about personal interests and not thinking about the interests of the majority from now on when you are young.

　　The most important quality you must possess is loyalty and honesty. Even if you have perfect qualities, if you are not loyal and honest, you will not become a builder who can make your motherland progress, but will become a destroyer who makes your motherland decline. A disloyal citizen in a country is the country's greatest internal enemy. This kind of internal enemy is more terrible than external enemies. We learned a story in school: Once upon a time, there was a yak in Tibet named "Shamoli." This yak was very proud of its tail. And when its tail was caught by thorns, because it was afraid of the hair on its tail falling off, it dared not swing its tail, and as a result, this yak stood in this place and was killed.

　　I sincerely hope that you can cherish your honest qualities as much as this yak cherishes its tail; and I hope that you, like this yak who is unwilling to lose a single hair on its tail, can strive to maintain your loyal and honest qualities in any difficult situation and not allow it to be damaged in the slightest.

　　Long live Chairman Mao!

　　Long live Sino-Burmese friendship!

　　Long live peace!

### 吴努总理在云南大学的演说词

　　吴努总理在云南大学的演说词云南大学的同学们：
    我很久以来就一直期望着能有像今天这样的机会同你们大家见面，所以我对今天的见面感到非常高兴。为此，首先让我对安排今天这个见面机会的云南大学当局，表示非常感谢。
    我想利用这个见面的机会，对你们大家讲几句话。你们的中华人民共和国和我们缅甸联邦之间，有一个共同点，这个共同点并非别的，那就是：我们两国的人民大众都是在不久以前才获得了创造自己命运的主权。
    因此，今天我要向你们云南大学学生们讲的话，也就是我经常向我国的学生们讲的话。这一点，希望你们首先把它记住。
    在不久的将来，你们将成为领导你们祖国进行建设的领导者。而做为一个未来的领导者，至少必须具备三个条件，这三个条件是：
    一、具备充分的工作能力；
    二、不自私自利；
    三、忠诚老实。
    大学毕业以后，你们将成为工程师、医生、科学家、机械师、教育家、军官、法官、行政官、律师、政治家等，也就是说，你们将在国家的各方面，担任领导人员。当你们成了领导人员，你们就可以按自己所具备的能力为人民大众服务。而工作能力薄弱的领导人员，只能替人民大众做很少的工作，而工作能力强的，就能够替人民大众做更多的工作。
    让我们以工程师做为例子：工作能力薄弱的工程师，只能使用在建筑一些一层两层的小楼房，建筑一些仅供十几个人工作的小工厂，建筑一些小河流的小桥梁等方面。而要建筑大的工人文化宫、政府的办公大楼、大的展览馆、可以供三四千工人工作的大工厂和横渡河山的大桥梁，则只有工作能力强的工程师，才能够胜任。因此，假如你们愿意为人民大众做更多的工作，那么，你们就必须努力充实自己的工作能力。
    当你们从大学刚毕业出来时，你们还不能说是具备了一切应有的工作能力；你们从大学毕业出来后，还必须继续努力，不断提高工作能力。但是，你们在大学里所受到的教育，对你们来说是重要的基础。在建筑一座楼房时，假如基础不稳固，尽管上面的建筑物多么好，不久就会倒塌下来的。同样的，当你们在大学里学习像楼房的基础一样的课程时，假如你们不认真去深造，那么你们的一生，就会像一座基础不牢固的楼房。因此，正如缅甸俗语所说：“乘热打铁”一样，我深切地期望你们利用这个在大学里受到高等教育的好机会，努力学习。
    在这里，我愿意深切地提请你们注意关于工作能力的一个重要问题。你们仅仅努力学好大学规定的各门课程是不够的，还应该努力学会与自己周围的地位比自己高的人、地位与自己同等的人或地位比自己低的人融洽地相处。学习成绩优良但同自己周围的人们相处不好的人是不能称为有充分工作能力的人的。你们会在世界上看到不少这样的人：他们虽然学问很好，但由于他们在同人们相处上搞得不好，因此他们既不能获得个人利益也不能为大多数人的利益服务。为了使你们不成为这样一类人，我希望你们从现在开始就加紧在这方面努力。
    大学是一个来自各地的人们的学习场所。因此，你们要努力与你们周围每天接触的人和睦地相处！在你们这样努力的时候，你们所获得的经验知识在你们从大学毕业后，到社会上与人民群众相处时，对你们是很有帮助的。
    关于工作能力问题就谈到这里。现在我就简单谈谈第二个条件——关于不自私自利的问题。一个国家的进步繁荣是首先依靠这个国家的人民。因此，如果一个国家的人民不看到国家的利益而只看到个人的利益的话，那么这个国家是没有希望的。这样的国家是无论怎样也不会进步的，一定会衰亡的。因此，假如你们愿意看到自己的祖国在不久的将来能与世界上先进的国家并驾齐驱的话，我深切地希望你们从现在年轻的时候起，就彻底扫除那种不为大多数人的利益着想，而只为个人利益着想的坏思想。
    你们要具备的最重要的条件是忠诚老实，纵然你们有完美的品质，如果你们不忠诚老实，你们就不会成为能使自己祖国进步的建设者，而将成为使祖国衰亡的破坏者。一个国家中的不忠实的公民是这个国家中的最大的内在敌人。这种内在敌人比外来敌人更为可怕。我们在学校里曾学过这样一个故事：从前西藏有一只名叫“沙默莉”的牦牛，这只牦牛很以它的尾巴为荣。而当它的尾巴为荆棘绊住时，由于它害怕尾上的毛脱落，它便不敢摆动自己的尾巴，结果这只牦牛就站在这个地方被杀死了。
    我深切地希望你们也像这只牦牛珍贵自己的尾巴一样能珍贵你们诚实的品质；并希望你们像这只不愿使自己尾巴上的毛脱落一根的牦牛一样，在任何困难的情况下都能努力维护自己忠诚老实的品质，不使其受一毫一发的损伤。
    毛主席万岁！
    中缅友好万岁！
    和平万岁！
