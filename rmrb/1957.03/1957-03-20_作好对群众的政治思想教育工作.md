Do a Good Job in Political and Ideological Education of the Masses
Yu Lin, in his speech, pointed out that the main trend of thought among the masses in Heilongjiang Province is progressive and healthy, but some unhealthy ideological tendencies have also emerged. These unhealthy tendencies should be given full attention and actively educated and overcome.

I fully endorse Chairman Mao's instructions at the Supreme State Conference, Premier Zhou's report, and Vice Chairman Chen Shutong's work report.

In 1956, the people of Heilongjiang Province, like the people of the whole country, under the correct leadership of the Central Committee, made great progress in political thought, demonstrated an unprecedentedly high socialist enthusiasm, carried out vigorous socialist construction and socialist transformation movements, and achieved great victories. Last year, the province made significant progress in industry, agriculture, and commerce, and the socialist economy has become the basic economic form in our province. New developments have also taken place in culture, education, and scientific research. In particular, after the Central Committee put forward the policy of "Letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," a thriving new atmosphere emerged in ideological activity, scientific research, and literary and artistic creation. Last year's practice proves that the people of the whole province actively support socialism, have a high spirit of patriotism, and have a high level of political awareness. The people's thinking is progressive and healthy. This is the mainstream and the basic aspect of the people's thinking.

A Very Few People Have a Tendency Towards Extreme Democratization

However, in the past year, a series of major events occurred at home and abroad, and class relations underwent tremendous changes. These changes inevitably reflected on people's ideological consciousness. Therefore, some noteworthy ideological problems were more prominently exposed in people's thinking. A very few people, due to our insufficient educational work, their own unhealthy thinking, and the influence of the bourgeoisie's hypocritical ideas of democracy and freedom, could not distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, right and wrong, and exposed some tendencies toward extreme democracy and anarchism. For example, some people believe that: "Democracy means that I have the final say, and everything must be done according to my opinion"; "Leadership means interfering with everyone's freedom, which is undemocratic"; "Leaders deciding issues is bureaucracy." They pitted democracy against organizational discipline and freedom against collectivism. A middle school student in Harbin beat a drum in the middle of the night, saying he was "developing his personality." Some believe that democracy means they can criticize others, but when criticized by others or encountering counter-criticism, they feel that others are undemocratic; some even resist criticism and self-criticism, openly advocating that everyone should "coexist peacefully and not interfere with each other" ideologically. Obviously, these actions are intended to undermine the democratic centralism of the people and to practice anarchism. In response, a tendency of laissez-faire, where some units and a few individuals did not dare to boldly lead or criticize, also occurred in some units, resulting in a period of laxity, loose labor discipline, and disruption of normal production and work order.

Erroneous Understanding in Implementing the "Hundred Schools" Policy

After the Central Committee put forward the policy of "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend and a hundred flowers bloom," there were also many ideological problems due to insufficient study. Some people only wanted to "sound off alone" and did not welcome others to "contend"; they felt uncomfortable as soon as they were criticized. In addition, some people were afraid of being criticized and did not dare to "sound off" or "bloom." Some people had unrealistic ideas of "not sounding off until it's earth-shattering," failing to understand that the level of academics and culture can only be gradually improved from the existing level through "contention." Still others misinterpreted this policy, using the excuse of "contention" to not perform administrative tasks. For example, a director of a theater troupe openly refused the task assigned to him by the leadership to direct a play, saying it was "freedom of creation." Some people took a liberal attitude toward "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend," not caring about how you "bloom" or "contend," accepting everything regardless of whether it was "fragrant flowers" or "poisonous weeds." For example, a theater troupe continuously performed "Living Buddha Ji Gong," which had absurd content and depicted despicable characters, for more than a month without anyone commenting. Conversely, some people were somewhat "tied up" and did not dare to let everyone "contend" and "bloom." They were a little "alarmed" when a little "weed" or "poisonous weed" emerged in the "contention" and "blooming," failing to understand that it is inevitable that some "weeds" or "poisonous weeds" will emerge in the "contention" and "blooming." These "weeds" can be turned into fertilizer after being processed, and "poisonous weeds," if handled well, can also immunize the broad masses of people. This is also the unity of opposites. If someone imagines that they do not want "weeds" and "poisonous weeds" to appear at all, or takes hasty, crude attitudes and simplistic methods to deal with them, it will only lead to bad consequences. It will not only hinder the implementation of the Party's policy of "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend and a hundred flowers bloom" but also damage the development of our academic and artistic undertakings.

Erroneous Thoughts in Improving Life

In addition, some incorrect ideas were also exposed in the relationship between national construction and people's lives. When the national construction, especially various economic constructions, achieved many brilliant achievements, some people had illusions (the one-sided and erroneous propaganda in our newspapers and periodicals for a period of time, such as talking more about improving life and less about hard struggle, talking more about a bright future and less about hard work to create it, further fueled this illusion). They believed that the era of hardship and difficulty in our country had passed, and now they could "enjoy" and "be particular." They forgot that the economic and cultural level of our country is still very backward. They did not proceed from the reality and possibilities of the country and often made some excessive demands. When these wishes were not met, they expressed dissatisfaction and complained. The phenomenon of extravagance and waste in some organs and enterprises and the phenomenon of luxury and waste among some workers and masses also grew. For example, a worker in Harbin invited more than sixty tables of guests for a big meal and drink when he got married. Individualism that sought fame and status and haggled over treatment was also more exposed. Some individuals cried during salary evaluation, and some worked passively and sang the tune of "payment according to work." Some people even made a "ten-year plan for promotion" (a cadre in a provincial company planned to become a section chief in five years and a manager in ten years). Some in the industrial and commercial circles always think, "More salary, higher status, less work," while not considering how to give full play to their personal strengths and do a good job.

Purely Technical Views in Advancing Towards Science

In the advance towards science, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of intellectuals is very high, and they have also achieved many successes. However, in a considerable number of people, the neglect of politics, purely technical views, and purely professional views have arisen. Some people have given up political study, and some even no longer read newspapers. Some have pitted the advance towards science against current work, with "doctors not seeing patients" and "teachers not preparing lessons." Some did not combine it with their own professional work or proceed from the reality, resulting in not having enough time and energy, and both work and the "advance" were delayed. In the advance of cadres in organs toward culture, some phenomena of neglecting politics also occurred, becoming a purely advance toward "mathematics, physics, and chemistry." Some young students had slogans such as "If you learn mathematics, physics, and chemistry, you can go anywhere in the world," "Technology first, politics later," and "Family first, red later."

These Undesirable Tendencies Can Be Overcome with Proper Education

What should be the view of the above-mentioned some bad phenomena? We believe that these phenomena are neither the mainstream of the people's thinking nor the ideological degeneration of some people. They are merely making hidden thoughts openly exposed, which is conducive to helping them. Therefore, it is not necessarily a bad thing. Some of these ideological problems belong to the problem of thinking methods, which is inevitable in the face of new and complex problems, and there is no need to worry and fear. But it should attract our full attention, so that we can actively work and patiently and meticulously carry out education, so as not to let it drift. Otherwise, it will develop and corrode our socialist construction. Our society today is still a vast ocean of the petty bourgeoisie, and the influence of bourgeois ideology is difficult to completely eliminate in a short period of time. That is to say, the occurrence of many erroneous ideas has its objective social roots and cannot be completely resolved in the short term. It seems to be resolved under certain circumstances, but it appears in another form under other conditions. Therefore, there is no need to be alarmed by their public exposure. The main problem should focus on examining and improving our ideological and political work. In this regard, our work indeed has many weaknesses, such as the dogmatic habits in propaganda and education work, which are not lively and lack persuasiveness, and some units still have the phenomenon of neglecting ideological and political work. The practice of last winter also proved this point. When we discovered and paid attention to some ideological problems and carried out some appropriate work, the situation changed. Some unhealthy trends have declined, and the atmosphere of thrift and simplicity has re-emerged. Of course, we must not make too high an estimate of these effects now. Therefore, in the future, we will resolutely follow Chairman Mao's instructions, strive to strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, conscientiously improve and do a good job in all aspects of ideological and political work, further improve the political consciousness of the masses, encourage and give play to the socialist enthusiasm of the masses, work diligently and thriftily, unite and strive for the construction of our great socialist motherland.

### 作好对群众的政治思想教育工作

专栏：

    作好对群众的政治思想教育工作
    于林　发言中指出，在黑龙江省群众的思想主流是前进的和健康的，但也发生了一些不良思想倾向。这些不良倾向应该引起充分注意，积极地去进行教育和克服。
    我完全拥护毛主席在最高国务会议上的指示，周总理的报告和陈叔通副主席的工作报告。
    1956年黑龙江省人民和全国人民一样，在中央的正确领导下，政治思想有了极大的提高，表现了空前高涨的社会主义积极性，进行了轰轰烈烈的社会主义建设和社会主义改造的运动，并且取得了巨大的胜利。去年全省工、农、商业各方面都有重大的进展，社会主义经济已经成为我省的基本经济形态。在文化教育和科学研究等方面也有了新的发展，特别是中央提出“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针以后，更出现了思想活跃、科学研究和文艺创作上的欣欣向荣的新气象。去年的实践证明：全省人民是积极拥护社会主义的，人民有高度的爱国主义精神，政治觉悟很高。人民的思想是前进的和健康的。这是人民思想的主流和基本的方面。
    极少数人有极端民主化的倾向
    但是，在去年，国内外发生了一系列的重大事件，阶级关系曾有巨大的变化，这些变化不能不反映到人们的思想意识上来，因而在人们的思想上也较为突出地暴露了一些值得注意的思想问题。有极少数的人，由于我们的教育工作不够，他们本身的思想不够健康，和受了资产阶级的虚伪的民主自由的思想影响，分不清敌我、是非的界线，暴露了某些极端民主和无政府主义的思想倾向。如，有的人认为： “民主就是我说了算，一切都得根据我的意见办事”；“有领导，就是干涉大家的自由，就是不民主”；“领导上决定问题，就是官僚主义”。他们把民主和组织纪律性对立起来，把自由和集体主义对立起来。哈尔滨有一个中学生，夜半击鼓，说是在 “发展个性”。有的认为：民主只能是他批评别人，受到别人批评或遇到反批评时，就觉得别人不民主了；甚至有人抵制批评和自我批评，公开主张大家在思想上应该“和平共处、互不干涉”。很显然，这些是要破坏人民内部的民主集中制，是要实行无政府主义。对此，在少数单位和少数人中也发生过不敢大胆领导，不敢批评的放任自流的倾向，因而在那些单位曾一度出现了自由散漫、劳动纪律松弛、影响了正常生产与工作秩序的现象。
    在贯彻百家争鸣方针中的错误认识
    中央提出“百家争鸣、百花齐放”的方针后，由于学习的不够，也有不少的思想问题。有的人只想“独鸣”，不欢迎别人“争鸣”，一受到批判就觉得不舒服；另外，有些人则因怕受批判不大敢“鸣”和“放”；有的人存在着“不鸣则已，一鸣惊人”的脱离实际的想法，不了解学术和文化的水平只有经过“争鸣”才能从现有水平上逐步提高；还有少数人错解了这个方针，借口“争鸣”不执行行政任务，如一位剧团导演，公开拒绝领导上给他的排戏任务，并且说这是“创作自由”；还有人对“百家争鸣”采取自由主义的态度，任你怎样“放”怎样“鸣”，概不过问，不管是“香花”、“毒草”一概接受，如某剧团连续演了一个多月的内容荒诞、形象恶劣的“济公活佛”，也没有人出来评论。与此相反，另外有些人则是有点“束手束脚”，不大敢让大家“争鸣”和“齐放”，看到“争鸣”和“齐放”当中出来一点“野草”或“毒草”，就有点“大惊小怪”，不了解在“争鸣”与“齐放”当中出来一点“杂草”或“毒草”是难免的，这些“杂草”经过处理可以变成肥料，“毒草”处理得好，还可以对广大的人们起免疫作用，这也是矛盾的统一。假如有人设想，根本不愿意有“杂草”和“毒草”出现，或者采取急躁的、粗暴的态度和简单化的方式来处理，那只能得到不好的后果，不但将要阻碍党的“百家争鸣、百花齐放”方针的贯彻，而且将损害我们的学术和艺术事业的发展。
    在改善生活方面的错误思想
    另外，在国家建设和人民生活的关系上，也暴露了一些不正确的思想。在国家建设，特别是各种经济建设得到了许多辉煌的成就的时候，有一部分人产生了错觉（我们在一个时期的报刊宣传上的片面性的错误宣传，如讲改善生活多，讲艰苦奋斗少，讲美好前途多，讲艰苦缔造少，更助长了这种错觉），他们认为：我国的艰难困苦时代已经过去了，现在可以“享乐”和“讲究”了；他们忘记了我们国家的经济和文化水平仍然是很落后的，他们不从国家的现实和可能出发，往往提出某些过高的要求，当这种愿望得不到满足的时候，就表示不满和牢骚。在一部分机关、企业中的铺张浪费现象和在部分职工群众中的奢侈浪费的现象也滋长了。如哈尔滨一个工人结婚时请了六十多桌客人大吃大喝。闹名誉地位、计较待遇的个人主义也更多地暴露了。个别人在评薪时哭鼻子，有的消极怠工，并唱出“按酬付劳”的论调。还有人竟作出“十年升官计划”（省某公司一个干部，计划五年当科长，十年后当经理）。在工商界当中也有些人总想：“工薪多一点、地位高一点、工作少一点”，而如何发挥个人所长、作好工作则考虑的不多。
    向科学进军中的单纯技术观点
    在向科学进军当中，广大知识分子的热情是很高的，也取得不少成就。但在相当多的一部分人当中，又产生了忽视政治、单纯技术观点和单纯业务观点。有些人放弃了政治学习，甚至有人连报纸也不看了。有的人则把向科学进军和当前业务对立起来，“医生不看病”，“教师不备课”。有些人不是结合本行业务和从现实水平出发，结果是时间、精力都来不及，业务和“进军”两耽误。在机关干部向文化进军当中，也发生了某些忽视政治的现象，成了单纯地向“数、理、化”进军，在一部分青年学生中则有“学会数、理、化，走遍天下都不怕”，“先技术、后政治”，“先家、后红”等口号。
    只要进行适当教育就能克服这些
      不良倾向
    对上述的某些不好的现象，应该是怎样看法呢？我们认为：这些现象，既不是人民思想的主流，也不是某些人的思想退化。只不过是把隐蔽的思想公开暴露出来，这样，反而有利于去帮助他们。所以，这并不一定是坏事。这些思想问题中，有些是属于思想方法的问题，这也是在新问题和复杂问题面前难免发生的，因而也不必耽虑害怕。但是应该引起我们的充分注意，这样才能积极地去作工作，去耐心地、细致地进行教育，不致于放任自流。否则，它会发展，会腐蚀我们的社会主义建设事业。我们今天的社会仍然是一片小资产阶级的汪洋大海，而且资产阶级思想影响也难于在短时期内肃清。这即是说，有许多错误思想的发生是有其客观社会根源的，不是短期内能彻底解决的，它在某种情况下，看起来好像解决了，但在另一种条件下又以另一种形式出现，所以不必因它们公开暴露了而大惊小怪，而主要的问题应该着重检查和改进我们的思想政治工作。在这方面我们的工作的确还有很多弱点，比如：宣传教育工作中的教条主义习气，不生动活泼，缺乏说服力，某些单位也还有忽视政治思想工作的现象等。去冬的实践也证明了这一点。当我们发现和注意了一些思想问题，并适当地进行了一些工作时，情况就有了变化，某些歪风邪气已经下降，节约朴素的风气又抬头了。当然，现在对这些收效决不可作出过高的估计。因此，我们今后将坚决遵照毛主席的指示，努力加强马克思列宁主义的学习，认真改进和作好各方面的政治思想工作，进一步提高人民群众的政治觉悟，鼓励和发挥人民群众的社会主义积极性，克勤克俭，团结奋发，为建设我们伟大的社会主义祖国而奋斗。
