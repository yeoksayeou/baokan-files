Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd: The Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs held a rally in Tokyo on March 1 to commemorate the third anniversary of the harm suffered by Japanese sailors from the US hydrogen bomb tests at Bikini Atoll and to oppose British hydrogen bomb tests on Christmas Island. More than 2,000 people attended the rally, including representatives from 22 prefectures and cities across the country, as well as Tokyo citizens.

Yasui Kaoru, Secretary-General of the Council, delivered a report at the meeting. He said that the number of signatures from the Japanese people demanding the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen bombs had exceeded 34 million. He emphasized that the movement to ban atomic and hydrogen bombs had grown from a stage of merely demanding prohibition through signatures to a stage capable of promoting political action.

Representatives from various sectors of Japan, including culture, fisheries, women, youth, workers, and religion, addressed the conference, demanding that Britain stop conducting hydrogen bomb tests. Prominent figures such as Katayama Tetsu and Kazami Akira, in their speeches, emphasized that the tragedy of Bikini Atoll must not be repeated.

The conference unanimously adopted a declaration expressing its firm opposition to Britain's plan to test hydrogen bombs on Christmas Island. The declaration pointed out that this plan is a dangerous link in the preparation for nuclear war. The declaration called on the British people, the people of Asian and African countries, as well as the governments of all countries in the world and the United Nations, to provide assistance in stopping the British hydrogen bomb tests.
