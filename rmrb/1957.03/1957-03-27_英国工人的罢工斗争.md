　　British Workers' Strike Struggle
　　Li Yichuan
    The largest strike movement in Britain since the 1926 general strike has begun. Since the end of last year, workers in the automotive, dock, and other industries have been holding strikes one after another. In January of this year, the number of participants in the strike increased threefold compared to December of last year, reaching 48,300; the number of working days lost due to the strike was approximately 132,000. On March 16, 200,000 shipbuilding workers went on strike together, bringing the manufacturing and repair of four to five million tons of ships in Britain to a standstill. On March 23, one million mechanical workers joined the strike struggle. This is the "first phase" of the mechanical workers' strike. If the workers' demands are not met, nearly three million mechanical workers will hold a general strike on April 6. This will halt the operations of 4,300 factories in Britain's aircraft manufacturing, electrical, machinery, and heavy machinery industries, whose products account for 40% of Britain's total exports.
        Demanding Wage Increases
      "Increase wages by 10%!" This is the current demand of the British working masses. By mid-January, eight million workers, including workers in various industrial sectors, even doctors, actors, bank clerks, and police, had made this demand. The strikes by mechanical and shipbuilding workers are also to fight for the realization of this demand.
    Due to the Conservative government's implementation of policies of military expansion, war preparations, and colonial suppression, especially the invasion of Egypt, Britain's economic situation has deteriorated, and the ruling bloc is attempting to solve its difficulties by intensifying the exploitation of laborers, thus threatening the lives of laborers more and more seriously. According to official statistics, the cost of living increased by 3% in 1956. However, even the pro-Conservative "News Chronicle" published an article on January 23 of this year, arguing that this kind of statistics is an absurd trick of playing with numbers. In fact, in 1956, prices rose due to the Conservative government's cancellation of bread and milk subsidies and price restrictions; after the Suez War, prices soared even more. According to price indices, bread prices increased by 17% in 1956, while milk, eggs, tobacco, rent, coal, medical expenses, shoe repairs, and laundry also increased by 5.5% to 7% respectively. Currently, the Conservative government has decided to cut social welfare expenses, and Parliament will soon pass a rent bill to abolish rent subsidies and rent restrictions. This will further increase the burden on the working people. However, while the lives of workers are deteriorating, the profits of capitalists have continued to grow. For example, the profits of shipbuilding companies increased by 13% in 1954-1955 and 11% in 1955-1956; in 1956, the dividends distributed by 397 mechanical companies after taxes increased by 11%; and the dividends of 114 electrical companies increased by 23%. Under these circumstances, the working masses have no choice but to take action to resist this attack by the ruling bloc and defend their right to live.
        Opposing Layoffs
    Opposing layoffs is another current struggle task of the British working masses. After the invasion of Egypt, the blockage of the Suez Canal caused Britain to face a serious oil shortage, and many companies reduced working hours and laid off workers in large numbers. At the same time, the British government also adopted a policy of deliberately creating unemployment as a means of preventing workers from demanding wage increases. As a result, the number of unemployed and semi-unemployed workers is increasing day by day. Last November, the number of unemployed people nationwide was 364,000, but by mid-February of this year, the number of registered unemployed people in Britain had increased to 421,500, an increase of 38,900 compared to mid-January. This rate of increase in unemployment is unprecedented since 1948. And now, the trend of increasing unemployment has not stopped. According to reliable estimates, even if the British economic situation does not continue to deteriorate, the number of unemployed people will increase to 560,000 this year. The number of semi-unemployed people was 73,000 in November 1956; on January 4 of this year, it increased to 150,000; recently, it is said to have fallen to 110,000, but this is because many semi-unemployed workers have become completely unemployed. In addition, millions of workers in Britain rely on extending working hours to make a living, and now their income has also been greatly affected. This situation is most serious in the automotive industry. The entire automotive industry has about 300,000 workers, and 70,000 are semi-unemployed. The Briggs Motor Factory's car manufacturing department has a total of 16,000 workers, of whom 12,000 only work three days a week, and 1,000 workers are to be laid off. In order to defend their right to work, workers in many automotive factories have successively held strikes against layoffs. The strike by workers at the Briggs Motor Factory has lasted the longest. Last December, 500 workers at this factory held a strike against the factory's layoffs; on January 2 of this year, another 1,000 workers went on strike against capitalists forcing them to work under unacceptable conditions; on January 27, another 7,300 workers broke out in a strike against the layoff of worker representatives, causing all 21,000 workers in the factory to stop working, forcing the capitalists to "take back their order." However, because the capitalists insisted on firing a worker representative, the workers continued to struggle.
  The "Daily Herald" described the strike struggle at this factory in an article: "In that factory, strike...negotiation...another strike...another negotiation...then stalemate...another strike." "The result creates the impression that the large automobile factory is not like a factory, but rather like a battlefield."
    Currently, the workers' strike struggle, especially the large-scale strike by mechanical workers, has greatly frightened the British ruling bloc. The Conservative government fears that this strike will turn into "political action" and drive them out of power, so it hurriedly used various conspiracies and tricks to "transform" this strike before the mechanical workers' strike began. The political reporter of the "Sunday Times" wrote at the time: "This struggle to be launched by capitalists and organized workers will have the serious danger of turning into 'political action' against the government." "Various urgent efforts are being made this week to avoid the threatened strike in the mechanical industry that will begin next week...the government is viewing this issue with greater worry than the shipbuilding workers' strike."
  Do Not Allow Capitalists to Open "Escape Hatches"
    However, the British workers' struggle for the right to live cannot be obstructed by the Conservative government. The British working masses have increasingly clearly realized that the Conservative government is a powerful helper to the monopoly groups' attack on laborers. Because the Conservative government has been shouting about "freezing wages," many capitalists dare to refuse workers' demands for wage increases. Shipbuilding worker leader McGarvey said, when talking about why capitalists in shipbuilding factories obtain high profits themselves but are unwilling to increase workers' wages, that this is because the capitalists received instructions from "higher authorities." The "higher authorities" he referred to are the Confederation of British Industries and the Conservative government.
    As for the government's "mediation" or "arbitration" of labor-capital disputes, it is also a way to openly help capitalists. For example, when the Briggs auto worker representative was fired by the capitalist last time, the government did not intervene; but when the workers decided to strike, the government came out to mediate. A "Reynold's News" reporter wrote on March 17: "I studied 261 cases that went to the Industrial Disputes Tribunal," and concluded: "There is some progress in cases with small problems and affecting a small number of people; but almost all large cases (labor side) lost." "The arbitration tribunal is just an (capitalists') escape hatch."
    With the gradual development and deepening of the workers' movement, the British Communist Party's election slogans have increasingly become the voice of the working masses. Dozens of trade union branches support the "elections now" slogan. Because the fact is very clear, only by forcing the Conservatives to step down and changing Britain's current domestic and foreign policies can Britain's economy escape its current disaster, and the lives of the working people be guaranteed and improved.

### 英国工人的罢工斗争

　　英国工人的罢工斗争
　　李一川
    在英国，1926年总罢工以来规模最大的罢工运动开始了。从去年年底以来，汽车、码头等业的工人就此起彼伏地举行着罢工。今年1月，参加罢工的人数比去年12月增加了三倍，达到四万八千三百人；因为罢工而损失的工作日约十三万两千个。3月16日，二十万造船工人一起停止了工作，这使得英国四、五百万吨船只的制造和修理工作陷于停顿状态。3月23日，一百万机械工人进入了罢工斗争。这是机械工人的“第一期”罢工。如果工人提出的要求不能得到满足，近三百万机械工人将在4月6日举行全体罢工。这样，就会使得英国的飞机制造、电气、机器和重型机械等工业部门的四千三百家工厂停工，它们的产品占英国出口货物总值的40％。
        要求增加工资
      “增加工资10％！”这是英国工人群众当前的要求。到1月中旬为止，提出这种要求的工人达到八百万人，其中包括各工业部门的工人，甚至医生、演员、银行职员和警察等。机械、造船工人的罢工，也正是为了争取他们这个要求得到实现。
    由于保守党政府执行了扩军备战和殖民镇压的政策，特别是由于发动了对埃及的侵略，英国经济情况日益恶化，而统治集团又企图用加强对劳动者进行剥削的办法来解决自己的困难，因此劳动者的生活就受到越来越严重的威胁。按照官方统计，1956年生活费用上涨了3％。可是，连亲保守党的“新闻纪事报”在今年1月23日发表的一篇文章里也认为这种统计是荒唐可笑的玩弄数字的把戏。事实上，1956年由于保守党政府取消了面包、牛奶补助和物价限制，物价就有所上涨；苏伊士战争之后，物价更是扶摇直上。据价格指数，1956年一年中，面包价格提高了17％，牛奶、鸡蛋、烟草、房租、煤炭、药费、鞋子修补和洗衣等也都分别涨价5.5％到7％。目前，保守党政府已经决定削减社会事业费，议会不久又将通过房租法案来取消房租津贴和房租限制。这就进一步加重了劳动人民的负担。但是，在工人生活恶化的同时，资本家的利润却一直在增长着。例如，造船公司的利润1954—1955年增长了13％，1955—1956年增长了11％；在1956年，三百九十七个机械公司纳税之后所分配的红利增加了11％；一百一十四个电气公司红利增加了23％。在这种情况下，工人群众就不得不行动起来抗击统治集团的这种进攻，保卫自己的生活权利。
        反对解雇工人
    反对解雇，这是当前英国工人群众的另一个斗争任务。在侵埃战争以后，苏伊士运河的堵塞使得英国面临着严重的石油荒，许多企业就减少工作时间和大批解雇工人。同时，英国政府还采取了故意制造失业的政策，来作为阻止工人要求增加工资的手段。因此失业工人和半失业工人与日俱增。去年11月，全国失业人数有三十六万四千人，而到今年2月中旬，登记的英国失业人数已增至四十二万一千五百人，比1月中旬的失业人数增加了三万八千九百人。失业人数的这种增加速度，是1948年以来未曾有过的。而现在，失业人数增加的趋势并没有停止。据可靠的估计，即使英国经济状况不再继续恶化下去，今年失业人数也将增加到五十六万。半失业人数在1956年11月是七万三千人；今年1月4日就增加为十五万人；最近据说已经下降到十一万，而原因是很多半失业工人已经完全失业了。此外，在英国有数以百万计的工人是靠延长工作时间来维持生活的，现在他们的收入也大受影响。这种情况，在汽车工业中显得最为严重。整个汽车工业大约有三十万工人，半失业人数就有七万人。布列格斯汽车工厂制造卧车部共有一万六千工人，其中一万二千人每星期只有三天工作，一千工人就要被解雇。为了保卫自己的工作权利，不少汽车工厂的工人已经先后举行了反对解雇工人的罢工。其中布列格斯汽车工厂工人的罢工坚持得最长久。去年12月，这个工厂的五百个工人举行罢工反对厂方解雇工人；今年1月2日，又有一千工人罢工反对资本家迫使他们在不可接受的条件下进行工作；1月27日，又爆发七千三百人反对解雇工人代表的罢工，使得厂里的二万一千名工人都停止工作，迫使资本家不得不“收回成命”。但是，由于资本家坚持开除一位工人代表，工人们又继续进行了斗争。
  “每日先驱报”在一篇文章中描写这个工厂的罢工斗争说：“在那个厂里，罢工……谈判……又一次罢工……又谈判……然后僵局……又罢工。”“结果造成这样一个印象：大汽车工厂不像是一个工厂，而倒像一个战场。”
    目前工人的罢工斗争，特别是机械工人的大罢工，已经使得英国统治集团大感恐惧。保守党政府唯恐这个罢工会转变成“政治行动”，把它们赶下台来，因此在机械工人罢工开始以前急忙运用各种阴谋诡计来“转变”这种罢工。“星期日泰晤士报”的政治记者在当时写道：“资本家和有组织的工人将要展开的这种斗争将有转变成反对政府的‘政治行动’的严重危险性”。“本周正在作各种紧急的努力来避免下周开始的威胁中的机械工业的罢工，……政府是以比对造船工人罢工更大的忧虑心情来看这个问题的。”
  不许给资本家开“太平门”
    但是，英国工人争取生存权利的斗争，决不是保守党政府所能阻挠得了的。英国工人群众已经越来越清楚地认识到，保守党政府正是垄断集团向劳动者进攻时的一个得力帮手。由于保守党政府一直喊着要“冻结工资”，因此很多资本家就敢于拒绝工人增加工资的要求。造船工人领袖麦克加微在谈到为什么造船工厂的资本家自己得到高额利润却不肯增加工人工资的时候说，这是因为资本家从“上级”接受了指示。他所说的“上级”，指的就是英国工业联合会和保守党政府。
    至于政府对劳资争执的“调解”或“仲裁”，也是公开给资本家帮忙的一种办法。例如，上次布列格斯汽车工人代表被资本家开除时，政府就不过问；但是当工人决定罢工时，政府却出来调解了。“雷诺新闻”的记者在3月17日就写道：“我研究了二百六十一起到工业争执法庭的案件”，结论是：“凡是问题小的、影响人数少的案件，还有些进展；而大的案件差不多（劳方）都输了。”“仲裁法庭不过是（资本家的）太平门”。
    随着工人运动的逐步发展和深入，英共提出的大选口号，已日益成为工人群众的呼声。数十个工会分会都支持“现在选举”的口号。因为，事实是很明白的，只有迫使保守党下台，改变英国现行的国内外政策，英国的经济才有摆脱目前灾难的可能，劳动人民的生活才能得到保障和提高。
