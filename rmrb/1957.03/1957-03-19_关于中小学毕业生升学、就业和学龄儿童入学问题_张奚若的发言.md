Now I would like to express some opinions on the issues of enrollment and employment for primary and secondary school graduates and school enrollment for school-age children.

I. The People's Cultural Demands Can Only Be Gradually Satisfied

This summer, many graduates from senior primary schools and junior high schools will not be able to continue their education, and the same is true for senior high school graduates. On the other hand, a considerable number of school-age children are unable to enroll in school. These are issues of great concern to everyone.

Why is this situation occurring this year? Is this situation normal? How can this problem be solved? These are questions that need to be clearly answered.

Some people may ask: Since the problems of enrollment and continuing education are so pressing, why doesn't the state build more schools? Is it that the state does not pay enough attention to education, resulting in this problem? I think I should first talk about the development of primary and secondary education since the founding of the People's Republic of China. As everyone knows, our primary and secondary education has developed rapidly in the past few years. In 1956, the number of secondary school students nationwide reached more than 5.15 million, nearly five times more than in 1949. The number of primary school students reached more than 63 million, equivalent to 258.3% of the number of students enrolled in 1949. Such a rate of development cannot be considered slow. At the same time, the state has provided huge and practical guarantees for the development of education in terms of financial, material, and human resources. From the perspective of funding, it has increased year by year. In 1956 alone, the funds for general education and normal education under the Ministry of Education accounted for 4.96% of the total state expenditure and 38.51% of the total expenditure on culture, education, and health. I think such a proportion is enough to show the state's emphasis on education. Looking at the construction of new school buildings, from 1950 to 1956, the newly built secondary school buildings were equivalent to 211.9% of the total area of secondary school buildings in old China before liberation, which is also enough to show that our schools are developing quite rapidly.

Of course, if we look at it from the perspective of the people's needs, there are still not enough schools, which is entirely true. So, can we develop as rapidly as we did last year? No! Because the state's financial and material resources are limited, it is impossible to invest too much in education. This contradiction exists not only today but will continue to exist for many years to come. How can this contradiction be resolved? It depends on the development of the national economy, and this contradiction can only be gradually resolved with the development of the national economy. Economic construction is the foundation of our entire national construction, and industrial construction is the focus of socialist construction. Our country must concentrate its main efforts to ensure industrial construction, and cultural and educational construction must be gradually developed on the basis of production development. Therefore, the development of general education must be carried out in appropriate proportions. If it "takes the lead" and attempts to exceed the development of economic construction, it will inevitably disperse the forces of key construction, affect the realization of industrialization, and shake the foundation of socialist construction, resulting in a lack of material guarantees for the development of education. This is obviously contrary to the long-term interests of the country and the people. On the other hand, if schools develop too quickly, the supply of teachers will not be able to keep up, and the schools will not be run well. We have already had this situation in recent years. This is also something that must be considered in our educational construction.

From this, it can be seen that the people's cultural demands can only be gradually satisfied. In a large country with a population of 600 million like ours, building more schools is not a question of whether it should be done or not, but a question of whether it is possible at a certain time.

II. It is Unrealistic and Unreasonable for All Primary and Secondary School Graduates to Advance to Higher Levels of Education

The phenomenon that not all primary and secondary school graduates can advance to higher levels of education will exist not only this year but also for a long time to come. This should be regarded as a normal phenomenon. Primary and secondary education is general education. General education is a kind of civic education. Its task is to cultivate new citizens with socialist consciousness, cultural cultivation, and healthy physiques for the country, and to train a reserve force and successors for the labor army to build socialism. Whether primary and secondary school students engage in productive labor or continue their education after graduating from school, their fundamental and ultimate goal is to develop socialist production and increase labor productivity. Starting from such a general task, primary and secondary school students should be ideologically prepared to engage in industrial and agricultural production labor or other construction work if they cannot continue their education.

No country in the world can achieve a situation where graduates of all levels of schools advance to higher levels of education without exception. The number of primary school students is always the largest, the number of secondary school students is smaller, and the number of university students is the smallest, forming a pyramid with a large base and a small top. This is a common law of educational development, and it is also a common law of social life. We know that the Soviet Union has been established for forty years and is currently transitioning to communism, but they are only now popularizing ten-year primary and secondary education. Most of their secondary school graduates do not go to university but engage in industrial and agricultural production labor. In the not too distant future, everyone in China will receive primary education, and even secondary education. By then, everyone will be intellectuals. If everyone refuses to participate in, for example, agricultural production labor, what will everyone eat? There is no reason why someone who has studied and become an intellectual should starve themselves to death. Therefore, I think the idea of requiring all primary and secondary school graduates to advance to higher levels of education is unrealistic and unreasonable.

Perhaps some people will ask: If this is the case, why was the enrollment rate so high last year, and why did the vast majority of senior primary school and junior high school graduates continue their education last year? Our answer to this question is: Last year, under the high tide of socialist construction, all undertakings experienced a special leap in development, and our schools at all levels enrolled more students. However, this brought many difficulties to the work, which was a shortcoming in our work last year. It cannot be assumed that our schools can develop as rapidly as they did last year in the future. Not only now, but even in the future after we have achieved universal compulsory education, most of those who have completed compulsory education will still have to participate in productive labor, and only a minority will continue their education. The reasons have already been stated above.

III. Labor is the Most Glorious in the New Society

How should the current issues of school enrollment for school-age children and continuing education for students be resolved and arranged?

We believe that primary and secondary education should be developed as appropriately as possible within the limits of the state's financial resources, while ensuring a certain quality. At present, in order to appropriately meet the people's cultural demands, in primary education, in addition to public schools, in rural areas, it is necessary to encourage relying on the strength of the masses, giving play to the enthusiasm of the masses, and appropriately developing private primary schools. Cooperatives with the conditions can also run schools to supplement the public schools. Advocating private primary schools must, of course, be based on the possibilities and willingness of the masses and cannot be forced. At the same time, urban primary and secondary schools should continue to implement the two-shift system. In addition, it is also necessary to encourage government agencies, factories, and mining enterprises to run schools, or neighborhood committees to run schools using the houses of government agencies. All of this is to enable more school-age children to have the opportunity to learn. Private primary schools and schools run by government agencies should be realistic and act according to conditions, and should not be forced to be uniform or demand too much.

However, we must point out that despite such efforts, it will still be impossible for all school-age children to have the opportunity to enroll in school for a considerable period of time, and it will still be impossible for all primary and secondary school graduates to continue their education for a considerable period of time. Therefore, school-age children who cannot enroll in school will have to enroll in school later, and primary and secondary school graduates who cannot continue their education should participate in productive labor. This is the correct path they should take. The purpose of educating the new generation is to make them conscious and active laborers with cultural cultivation, who can produce and labor more efficiently. Therefore, primary and secondary school graduates who are from rural areas should resolutely and happily return to the countryside to participate in agricultural production if they cannot continue their education. Urban students should also find jobs according to specific circumstances and possibilities. If they cannot find jobs for the time being, they should participate in household labor and study at home.

In recent years, we have relaxed the leadership of political and ideological education in primary and secondary schools. In particular, because labor education was relaxed last year, it is easier to create ideological confusion this year. Therefore, we must strengthen ideological work among students to enable them to have a correct view of productive labor. At the same time, we must also conduct publicity and explanations to all sectors of society, hoping to reverse the various misconceptions in people's minds and form correct public opinion.

Some students or parents believe that it is too uneconomical to go to the fields or work in factories after finishing middle and primary school. Some people say that it is "unlucky" for primary and secondary school graduates to engage in productive labor. We say that these views are wrong. It is a good phenomenon for primary and secondary school graduates to engage in industrial and agricultural production labor. This is in line with the requirements of socialist construction. Because building socialist industry and agriculture requires workers and peasants to have a certain level of education. The higher their level of education, the more conducive it will be to the development of production. If the majority of peasants and workers gradually have a primary school or even a middle school education, it is conceivable how great the benefits will be to improving and raising production technology, to developing production, and to the country! It is our fundamental task in carrying out the cultural revolution to enable workers and peasants to enjoy culture. Primary and secondary school graduates participating in productive labor is a measure to realize this task. In our country, it will take decades for all peasants to have a junior high school education. Today, primary and secondary school graduates who engage in agricultural production are of course the first to realize this ideal. They will become the first generation of new-style farmers with culture in China. As long as they are willing to work hard in production and study hard, they will inevitably be supported by the peasants and become the pillars and backbones of building a new socialist countryside. In the Soviet Union, it is also very common for secondary school graduates to participate in industrial and agricultural production labor. In 1953, 70% of the technicians at the Stalin Automobile Factory in Moscow were graduates of ten-year primary and secondary schools (equivalent to our high school level); at the same time, many secondary school graduates also participated in agricultural production. From this, it can be seen that it is by no means a "unlucky" thing for primary and secondary school graduates to participate in industrial and agricultural production labor. It is necessary for national construction and is a very glorious thing.

Therefore, at present, we must widely publicize the idea of "labor is glorious" among the broad masses of students and in society, and further criticize the erroneous ideas of "all trades are inferior, only studying is superior" and "one who excels in learning can become an official." At the same time, we must also criticize the kind of view that divides labor into grades, such as thinking that mental labor is stronger than physical labor, being a worker is stronger than being a farmer, and being a cooperative accountant is stronger than farming, and so on. We must make everyone deeply realize that labor is the source of creating wealth, creating material civilization, and creating human happiness, and recognize that labor is the most glorious and most noble cause in our new society. Everyone should respect labor, love labor, and work hard in production and construction in order to build our country into a great socialist country. Some students feel that engaging in labor is okay, but they are unwilling to return to the countryside, unwilling to farm, and feel that rural life is hard and farming has no future. Obviously, this idea is wrong. We know that to realize the country's socialist industrialization, it is necessary to develop agriculture accordingly. That is to say, socialist industrialization must have a strong socialist agriculture as an important condition for its development. At present, our country has basically completed the socialist transformation of agriculture, and the superiority of agricultural cooperation has been recognized by the people of the whole country. Although the lives of peasants are not good enough at present, they have improved compared with the past, and will gradually improve even more in the future. As for saying that "farming has no future," that is even more unfounded. We believe that as long as primary and secondary school graduates correctly understand the meaning of labor, put down the airs of intellectuals, and actively engage in labor, they will make achievements in their work, gain the trust of the masses, and even be elected as cadres by the masses. As everyone knows, Xu Jianchun, a graduate of senior primary school in Yexian County, Shandong Province, participated in agricultural production in 1951 and is now a capable director of a cooperative, and was gloriously elected as a national agricultural labor model. Last year, she led more than 4,000 members of the whole community to overcome natural disasters and achieve large-scale high yields of wheat, which increased the income of the members. Another example is Li Youxuan, a junior high school graduate and pig farmer at a farm in Yucheng County, Henan Province, who loves the pig farming business and raises more than 100 pigs he raises fat and strong, and his work is very outstanding, and because he paid attention to the use of substitutes in feeding, he saved the country 32,000 kilograms of soybean cake last year. Due to his active work, he was rated as a labor model by the farm three times. There are many similar examples. These young people engaged in agricultural production labor have made outstanding contributions to the motherland. Is this still "no future" and "no prospects"? Similarly, in the past few years, there has also been a large number of primary and secondary school graduates who have invested in industrial production, with about 600,000 people in last year alone. Many of them have also shown a high degree of initiative and creativity in their work, and many have also become advanced workers or labor models. All of the above shows that in our country, engaging in any cause of building a socialist motherland is promising, and all have an infinitely bright and broad future. We must widely publicize these examples in society, as they are living materials for communist education and labor education.

Today, all primary and secondary school students should clearly recognize their learning purpose, which is to engage in productive labor better and increase labor productivity. It is to be a laborer with socialist consciousness and cultural cultivation, and to contribute all their youthful strength to the country's industrialization and agricultural construction. In particular, the majority of primary and secondary school graduates should know that our country's agricultural production is still very backward, and the Party and the People's Government eagerly hope that a large number of educated young people will participate in agricultural construction, so that they consciously use their knowledge and labor to shoulder the glorious task of building a new socialist countryside. At the same time, we must not only educate students, but also make all parents of students and all members of society understand this truth. Cadres and intellectuals, especially senior cadres and senior intellectuals, should take the lead by example. If their children do not have the opportunity to continue their education, they should actively persuade them to engage in labor. Workers and peasant parents should persuade their children together with teachers to inherit the excellent tradition of hard work and thrift, and make contributions to the motherland on the labor front. In addition, we also require rural grassroots cadres, cadres of agricultural production cooperatives, and responsible persons of relevant industrial departments and factories and mines to take a warm welcome attitude towards primary and secondary school graduates who participate in agricultural labor and industrial production, do a good job in organization and arrangements, and give them more encouragement and help in their actual work.

Judging from the current economic development situation in our country, it is not yet possible for the country to immediately make them all employed. For some primary and secondary school graduates in cities who can neither continue their education nor be employed, we hope that parents will encourage them to participate in household labor and study at home, and arrange the necessary self-study environment and conditions for them as much as possible. In order to help these self-studying students, in the past, local education administrative departments, youth league organizations, and relevant departments have adopted methods such as organizing self-study groups, running tutoring classes, and radio lectures to guide their self-study, and have achieved certain results. In the future, local education departments should continue to work with relevant departments to do this work well, and at the same time, we hope that relevant departments, off-campus education institutions, and so on will arrange more self-study conditions for them and provide some convenience, so that they can better help these students improve in self-study, so as to prepare better conditions for them to participate in productive labor and continue their education in the future.

Regarding the proposal made by Vice Premier Li Fuchun to organize a part of the senior primary school and junior high school graduates who cannot continue their education to receive one or two years of spare-time technical education, we are also preparing to conduct specific research in coordination with the relevant departments.

IV. Conducting Labor Education for the Younger Generation

In the future, we must further and deeply carry out labor education in our schools at all levels. Labor education is a regular and basic content in the political and ideological education of students. This education should be closely combined with patriotism education, especially the current education of building the country with diligence and thrift, and hard work. We must educate our young generation to let them know the hard work of revolutionary creation, know the various difficulties that may be encountered on the road to construction, so that they can carry forward the fine traditions of hard work of our ancestors and revolutionary martyrs, and we must educate and encourage them to often approach workers and peasants, learn the hard work, diligence, and simplicity of workers and peasants, actively create their own new life, and solve personal learning and life problems in the spirit of hard work and simplicity. Today, we especially want to encourage students and school cadres and teachers to build schools hard, run schools with diligence and thrift, and strive to run schools well and study hard under difficult conditions. At the same time, labor education should also be combined with collectivism education and discipline education. In the issue of continuing education and employment, there is often a contradiction between personal interests and collective interests. In this case, we require students to consciously make personal interests subordinate to collective interests. We must greatly emphasize the issue of students observing discipline. Needless to say, just from the perspective of production, without labor discipline, nothing else can be done well. We must train labor reserve forces for the country, so we must pay great attention to discipline education so that students can consciously abide by discipline. In the past, our education administrative departments did not pay enough attention to labor education. In 1953 and 1954, we once paid more attention to it, but later we relaxed it somewhat. Generally speaking, in the past few years, our labor education has been limited to generalized calls, lacking specific measures and specific guidance. This has formed the current tendency of schools to a certain extent to be detached from production, and students' production knowledge, labor views, and labor habits are very poor. They have ideas of despising labor, especially physical labor. This is a fundamental shortcoming in our current education work, which must be corrected and improved. To this end, we must increase the content related to labor education and production knowledge in the textbooks in the future, and at the same time, we must also deeply implement labor education through extracurricular life and organized activities inside and outside the school.

Conducting labor education cannot rely solely on the efforts of the school. It requires the common attention and common advocacy of the entire society. To this end, we hope that all members and all relevant departments and all members of society will unanimously support us and jointly shoulder the responsibility of conducting labor education for the younger generation, thereby establishing a new social atmosphere of loving labor and respecting labor.

Dear members:

Today I only talked about one problem in our general education. In fact, as everyone knows, there are many problems. The most important thing is: at present, our school education has a tendency to be detached from reality and cannot adapt well to economic development. There are many problems in the school system, curriculum, teaching materials, and so on, which need to be re-examined. Therefore, this year we are preparing to sum up experience and seek proper solutions to these problems in response to these problems. In the second half of last year, the Ministry of Education successively sent two batches of investigation teams to investigate and study these issues, and this year we are also preparing to concentrate our main efforts to study and solve these problems throughout the year. Not long ago, after the CPPCC members and NPC deputies inspected the work, they put forward many valuable opinions on our work. Many members' speeches in this meeting also put forward many useful opinions on education work, which is very enlightening and helpful for us to improve our work. We hope that all members will continue to give us more and greater help in the future so that we can better complete the glorious tasks assigned to us by the country and the people.

专栏：

    关于中小学毕业生升学、就业和学龄儿童入学问题
    张奚若的发言
    现在我想就中、小学毕业生升学就业和学龄儿童入学问题，发表一点意见。
    一、人民文化要求只能逐步满足
    今年暑假，高小和初中毕业生都有很多人不能升学，高中毕业生也有同样情况。另一方面，还有相当数量的学龄儿童不能入学。这些都是大家非常关心的问题。
    为什么今年会出现这种情况呢？这种情况是不是正常的呢？如何解决这个问题呢？这些问题都是需要明确回答的。
    有人会问：目前既然入学和升学问题如此紧张，为什么国家不多办一些学校呢？是不是国家对教育事业重视不够，以致造成这样的问题呢？我想，我应当先谈一谈建国以来中、小学教育事业的发展状况。大家知道，过去几年，我们中、小学教育的发展是很快的。1956年，全国中学学生已经达到五百一十五万余人，与1949年相比，发展到将近五倍。小学学生达到六千三百余万人，相当于1949年在校人数的258.3％。这样的发展速度无论如何不能说是慢的。同时，国家对教育事业的发展，在财力、物力和人力上都给了巨大和切实的保证。从经费上看，逐年都有增长。1956年仅教育部所主管的普通教育和师范教育事业的经费，就占国家总支出的4.96％，占整个文教卫生总支出的38.51％。这样的比例我想足以说明国家对教育事业的重视。再从学校校舍增建情况来看，1950年到1956年，中学新建的校舍已相当于解放前旧中国中学校舍总面积的211.9％，这也足以说明我们的学校发展是相当快的。
    当然，如果从人民需要看，学校还很不够，这完全是事实。那末，能不能像去年那样大发展呢？不能！因为国家财力物力有限，不可能对教育事业投资过多。这一矛盾不仅今天存在，就是在今后许多年内还要存在。这一矛盾怎样解决呢？这决定于国民经济的发展，只有随着国民经济的发展才能逐步解决这个矛盾。经济建设是我们整个国家建设的基础，而工业建设又是社会主义建设的重点。我们国家必须集中主要力量保证工业建设，文化教育建设必须在生产发展的基础上逐步予以发展。因此普通教育事业的发展必须按照适当的比例进行。如果它“一马当先”企图超过经济建设的发展，那就必然会分散重点建设的力量，影响工业化的实现，动摇社会主义建设的根基，结果是使教育事业的发展缺乏物质保证。这显然是与国家和人民的长远利益相违背的。另一方面，学校发展过快，师资供应不上，学校就办不好。近几年来我们已有这种情况。这也是在我们的教育建设中必须考虑到的。
    由此可见，人民的文化要求只能逐步满足。在我们这样一个六亿人口的大国中，多办学校不是应该不应该的问题，而是在某一时期中可能不可能的问题。
    二、中小学毕业生全部升学不现实也不合理
    小学、中学毕业生不能全部逐级升学的现象，不仅在今年，并且在今后很长时期内也将存在。这应当看作是一种正常的现象。中、小学教育是普通教育。普通教育是一种公民教育。它的任务是为国家培养具有社会主义觉悟、有文化教养和健康体质的新公民，培养建设社会主义的劳动大军的后备队和接班人。中小学生从学校毕业后不论从事生产劳动或升学，其根本的、最后的目的都在于发展社会主义生产，提高劳动生产率。从上述这样一个总的任务出发，当前，中、小学学生毕业后，应当在思想上做好准备，如果不能升学，就应去从事工农业生产劳动或其他建设工作。
    世界上无论哪个国家，都不可能作到各级学校毕业生一律逐级升学。总是小学学生数量最大，中学学生数量较小，大学学生数量最小，形成一座下面大上面小的宝塔形式。这是教育发展的一个共同规律，这也是社会生活的一个共同规律。我们知道苏联建国已经四十年了，目前正在向共产主义过渡，但是现在他们也不过才正在普及十年制中小学教育。他们的中学毕业生也不是全部升大学，而是大多数从事工农业生产劳动。中国在不太远的将来，也会人人都受小学教育，甚至中学教育。到那时人人都成了知识分子，如果大家都不去参加，譬如说，农业生产劳动，请问大家吃什么？天下那有念了书，成了知识分子，反而要把自己自动饿死的道理？所以，我认为，要求中小学毕业生全部逐级升学这种想法是不现实的不合理的。
    也许有人会问：既然如此，那末为什么去年升学率那么大，为什么去年高初中毕业生绝大多数都升了学呢？对于这一问题，我们的回答是：去年在社会主义建设的高潮下，各项事业有着特别飞跃的发展，我们的各级学校也就多招了一些学生。但是这给工作带来了不少困难，这是我们去年工作中的一个缺点。不能设想我们的学校今后都能像去年那样地大发展。不仅是现在，就是在将来我们实现普及义务教育之后，那些受完了义务教育的人，大多数还是要去参加生产劳动，升学的只能占少数。理由上边已经说过。
    三、新社会劳动最光荣
    对当前学龄儿童入学和学生升学问题该怎样解决，怎样安排呢？
    我们认为：在国家财政力量允许的范围内，在保证一定质量的前提下，中小学教育是应当尽可能作适当的发展的。现时，为了适当地满足人民对文化的要求，在小学教育方面，除了公办以外，在农村，要提倡依靠群众的力量，发挥群众的积极性，适当发展民办小学，有条件的合作社也可以办学，以补公立学校之不足。提倡民办小学，当然要根据群众的可能和自愿，不能有强迫命令，同时城市中小学，要继续推行二部制。此外，还要提倡机关、厂矿企业办学，或者街道借机关的房屋办学。所有这一切都是为了使较多的学龄儿童得到学习的机会。对民办小学和机关办学，要实事求是，根据条件办事，不可强求一律，要求过高。
    但是我们一定要指出，尽管经过这样的努力，在相当长的时期内仍然是不可能使所有学龄儿童都得到入学机会的，在相当长的时期内仍然是不可能使所有中小学毕业生全部升学的。因此不能入学的学龄儿童就只好晚一些入学，不能升学的中小学毕业生，就应当去参加生产劳动。这是他们应走的正确道路。我们要使新生一代都受教育，目的就是要使他们成为有文化教养的自觉的积极的劳动者，能够更有效率地生产劳动。因此凡是家在农村的中小学毕业生，如果不能升学，就应当毅然决然愉快地回到农村去参加农业生产。城市学生也应当根据具体情况和可能条件去找职业。如果一时找不到职业，就应当参加家庭劳动和在家自学。
    近年来我们对中小学的政治思想教育的领导有些放松。特别是因为去年放松了劳动教育，今年发生这样情况就更容易造成思想混乱。因此我们要对学生加强思想工作，使他们对生产劳动能有正确的看法。同时我们对社会各方也须进行宣传解释，期能扭转当前人们思想上的各种错觉，形成正确的社会舆论。
    有些学生或家长认为：念完了中学、小学，还要去种地、做工，未免太不上算。有些人说，中小学毕业去从事生产劳动是“倒霉”。我们说这些看法是不对的。中小学毕业生从事工农业生产劳动，这是一种好现象。这是符合社会主义建设要求的。因为建设社会主义的工业和农业，就要求工人农民有一定的文化程度。他们的文化程度越高，对发展生产就越有利。如果逐步做到多数的农民、工人都有了小学以至中学程度，可以想见，那对改进和提高生产技术，对发展生产将有多么大的好处，对国家将会有多么大的好处！使工农劳动者享有文化本是我们进行文化革命的根本任务。中小学毕业生参加生产劳动就是实现这个任务的一种措施。在我们中国，要所有的农民都具有初中毕业的文化程度，那是几十年后的事情。今天的中小学毕业生去从事农业生产当然是首先实现了这个理想，他们将会成为中国第一代有文化的新式农民。只要他们肯努力生产、努力学习，他们必然会受到农民的拥护，成为建设社会主义新农村的支柱和骨干。在苏联，中学毕业生参加工农业生产劳动也是极普通的事情。在1953年时，莫斯科的斯大林汽车工厂的技术工人就有70％是十年制中小学毕业生（相当于我们的高中程度）；同时也有很多中学毕业生参加了农业生产。由此可见，中小学毕业生参加工农业生产劳动，决不是什么“倒霉”的事，它是国家建设之所必需，是一种很光荣的事情。
    为此，目前我们必须在广大学生中、在社会上广泛宣传“劳动光荣”的思想，进一步批判“万般皆下品、唯有读书高”和“学而优则仕”的错误思想。同时我们也要批判那种对劳动分等级的看法，如认为脑力劳动比体力劳动强，当工人比当农民强、当合作社会计比种地强等等。我们要使每个人深刻认识到劳动是创造财富、创造物质文明、创造人类幸福的根源，认识到劳动在我们新社会里是最光荣、最崇高的事业。人人都应当尊重劳动、热爱劳动，努力生产建设，才能把我国建设成为伟大的社会主义国家。有的学生觉得从事劳动可以，但是不愿意回农村，不愿意种地，觉得农村生活苦，种地最没有前途。显然这种想法是错误的。我们知道要实现国家社会主义工业化，必须要相应地发展农业。也就是说，社会主义工业化必须有强大的社会主义农业作为它发展的一个重要条件。目前我国已经基本上完成了农业社会主义改造，农业合作化的优越性已经为全国人民所公认。农民的生活虽然目前还不够好，但是较以往已经有了提高，并且今后将会逐步有更大的提高。至于说“种地没有前途”，那更是没有根据的。我们认为：中小学毕业生只要正确地认识劳动的意义，放下知识分子的架子，积极从事劳动，那么他们就会在工作中做出成绩，得到群众的信任，以至被群众推选为干部。大家知道山东省掖县高小毕业生徐建春，1951年参加农业生产，现在已经是一个能干的合作社主任了，并且被光荣地选为全国农业劳动模范。去年她领导全社四千多社员，战胜了天灾，获得小麦的大面积丰产，使社员们增加了收入。又如河南虞城县农场养猪工人、初中毕业生李友轩，热爱养猪事业，把自己所饲养的一百多头猪养得又肥又壮，工作非常出色，并且由于他在饲养中注意使用了代用品，去年一年为国家节约了三万二千斤豆饼。由于他的积极工作，他被农场三次评为劳动模范。类似这样的事例是很多的。这些从事农业生产劳动的青年们，为祖国作出卓越的贡献，这难道还是“没前途”、“没出息”的吗？同样的，几年来中小学毕业生投入工业生产的也有很大的一个数量，仅仅去年一年就有六十万人左右。他们中间也有很多人在劳动中发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，不少人还成为先进工作者或劳动模范。以上这一些都说明：在我们国家中，从事建设社会主义祖国的任何一项事业都是有出息的，都同样有着无限光明广阔的前途。这些事例我们要在社会上广为宣传，它们是活生生的共产主义教育和劳动教育的材料。
    今天，全体中小学学生都应该明确认识自己的学习目的，就是为着更好地从事生产劳动，提高劳动生产率。就是为着作一个有社会主义觉悟、有文化教养的劳动者，为国家工业化、为国家农业建设贡献出自己全部的青春力量。特别是要使大多数的中小学毕业生知道，我国农业生产现时还很落后，党和人民政府殷切希望大量的知识青年参加农业建设，从而使他们自觉地以自己的知识和劳动，担负起建设社会主义新农村的光荣任务。同时我们不仅要向学生进行教育，并且还要使所有的学生家长和全体社会人士懂得这样的道理。干部和知识分子，特别是高级干部和高级知识分子，首先应该以身作则。如果自己的孩子没有机会升学，就要积极说服他们从事劳动。工人和农民家长们，要同教师一起说服自己的子女，继承艰苦勤劳的优秀传统，在劳动战线上为祖国立功。此外，我们还要求农村基层干部、农业生产合作社的干部，要求有关工业部门和厂矿负责人，对于参加农业劳动和工业生产的中小学毕业生，采取热诚欢迎的态度，做好组织安排工作，并在实际工作中多多给予他们以鼓励和帮助。
    从我国当前经济发展的情况看来，目前国家还没有可能立即使他们全部就业。城市中一部分既不能升学又不能就业的中小学毕业生，我们希望家长们鼓励他们参加家庭劳动，在家自学，尽可能地为他们安排必要的自学环境和条件。为帮助这些自学的学生，过去各地教育行政部门、青年团组织和有关部门，曾经采取组织自学小组，举办补习班、广播讲座等办法指导他们自学，并且已经收到了一定的效果。今后，各地教育部门仍然要会同有关部门做好这项工作，同时也希望有关部门、校外教育机关等更多地为他们安排一些自学条件，给予一些方便，以便能更好地帮助这些学生在自学中得到提高，从而为他们日后参加生产劳动和升学准备更好的条件。
    关于李富春副总理所建议的，组织一部分不能升学的高小、初中毕业生受一、两年业余技术教育的问题，我们也准备协同各有关部门进行具体研究。
    四、向青年一代进行劳动教育
    今后，在我们各级学校中，必须进一步地、深入地进行劳动教育。劳动教育是对学生政治思想教育中的一个经常的基本的内容。这一教育应当和爱国主义教育、特别是当前的勤俭建国、艰苦奋斗的教育紧密结合起来。我们必须教育我们的青少年一代，让他们知道革命的艰苦缔造、知道建设道路上可能遇到的各种困难，从而使他们发扬我们祖先和革命先烈们艰苦奋斗的优良传统，并且要教育鼓励他们经常去接近工人农民，学习工人农民的艰苦勤劳朴素的作风，积极地创造自己的新生活，对个人的学习和生活问题都本着艰苦朴素的精神去解决。我们今天特别要提倡学生和学校干部、教师们一道艰苦建校，勤俭办校，在困难的条件下，力求把学校办好，使自己学好。同时，进行劳动教育也要和集体主义教育和纪律教育结合起来。在升学就业问题上，常常发生个人利益和集体利益的矛盾。在这种情况下，我们要求学生们都能自觉地作到个人利益服从集体利益。我们要大大强调学生遵守纪律的问题。不必说别的，只从生产的角度来说，没有劳动纪律，那就其他都办不好。我们要为国家培养劳动后备力量，自然必须十分注意纪律教育，使学生能够自觉地遵守纪律。过去我们教育行政部门对劳动教育重视不够，1953、54两年曾经一度较为重视，以后又有些放松。一般地说，几年来我们对劳动教育多限于一般化的号召，缺乏具体措施和具体指导。这样就形成目前学校在一定程度上的脱离生产的偏向，学生的生产知识和劳动观点、劳动习惯都很差。他们存在着轻视劳动，特别是轻视体力劳动的思想。这是我们当前教育工作中的一个带根本性的缺点，必须切实纠正和改进。为此，我们今后要在教材中增加有关劳动教育和生产知识的内容，同时还要在校内、校外通过课外生活、组织活动等深入贯彻劳动教育。
    进行劳动教育，决不能仅仅依靠学校的努力，它需要整个社会的共同注意和共同提倡。为此，我们希望各位委员和各个有关部门、全体社会人士一致支持我们，共同担负起向年青一代进行劳动教育的责任，从而树立起热爱劳动和尊重劳动的新的社会风气。
    各位委员：
    今天我只谈了我们普通教育中的一个问题。其实，大家知道，问题是很多。最重要的是：目前我们的学校教育有脱离实际的倾向，还不能很好地和经济发展相适应。学制、课程、教材等方面都存在不少问题，须要我们重新加以研究。因此今年我们准备针对这些问题，总结经验，谋求予以妥善的解决。去年下半年教育部已经先后派出两批调查组对这些问题作了调查研究，今年我们并准备以全年的时间，集中主要力量来研究解决这些问题。前此不久，政协委员和人大代表视察工作后曾对我们的工作提了许多宝贵的意见，这次会议中很多委员的发言也对教育工作提了很多很有益的意见，这对我们改进工作很有启发和帮助，希望今后各位委员继续给我们以更多更大的帮助，以便我们能更好地完成国家和人民交给我们的光荣任务。
