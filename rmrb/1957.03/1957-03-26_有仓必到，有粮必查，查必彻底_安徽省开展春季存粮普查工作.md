Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, March 23rd. Anhui Province has recently launched a comprehensive spring grain stock census. More than 1,400 cadres have been drawn from the provincial to county levels to form nearly 200 grain stock census teams, which have been dispatched to various regions. Grain departments below the county level have also drawn a large number of cadres to conduct in-depth inspections of the safety of grain stocks at various storage points. This grain stock census work has basically met the requirements of "inspect every granary, check every grain, check thoroughly."

The grain stock inspection work in Anhui Province is expected to be completed in early April. In the process of inspecting grain stocks, various localities have promptly dealt with a batch of grain that had experienced mold, insect infestation, rodent damage, and bird damage. Some areas, due to the large amount of such grain, were unable to handle it all in a timely manner, so they formulated plans for handling it in stages and batches. Through the grain stock census, various localities have also promoted the cleaning and sanitation of granaries and improved and established warehousing management systems.

Thanks to the attention paid to grain storage work by the grain departments of Anhui Province, by the end of last year, the granaries in 22 counties and cities across the province had basically achieved no rats, no birds, no insect pests, no mold, and no accidents. In addition, the granaries of 662 grain management stations had all achieved "four nos." By the end of last year, the capacity of granaries in the province that achieved the "four nos" accounted for 78.2% of the province's total storage capacity. Due to the good grain storage work done in Anhui Province last year, the province saved more than 8.5 million catties of grain for the state, based solely on the grain that was released from storage.

　　有仓必到，有粮必查，查必彻底
　　安徽省开展春季存粮普查工作
    新华社合肥23日电　最近安徽省全面地开展了春季存粮的普查工作。从省到县已经抽调了一千四百多名干部，组成了将近二百个存粮普查小组，分赴各地。县级以下的粮食部门，也抽调了大批干部深入存粮点检查存粮的安全情况。这次普查存粮的工作，基本上做到了“有仓必到，有粮必查，查必彻底”的要求。
    安徽省这次检查存粮的工作预计在4月上旬结束。各地在检查存粮的工作中，及时地处理了一批发生霉变、虫害、鼠害和雀害的粮食。有些地区由于这类粮食较多，不能及时处理完，就订出了分期、分批处理的计划。各地通过存粮的普查，还推动了粮仓的清洁卫生工作，并且健全和建立了仓储管理制度。
    安徽省粮食部门由于注意了粮食保管工作，去年年底，全省已经有二十二个县、市的粮仓基本上做到了无鼠雀、无虫害、无霉变、无事故，另外有六百六十二个粮食管理站的粮仓全部做到“四无”。去年年底，全省做到“四无”的粮仓的容量占全省总仓容量的78.2％。安徽省去年由于粮食保管工作做的好，仅仅以出仓的粮食计算，就为国家节约了八百五十多万斤粮食。
