Weinan County Achieves Results in Breeding Draught Animals; Jianhua Cooperative Develops a Strong Atmosphere of Caring for Draught Animals
    (Reported by this newspaper) Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, has actively bred draught animals since cooperativization, basically meeting the requirements of a county abundant in draught animals.
    Weinan County has 17,127 female animals, of which 11,670 have reproductive capacity. In the winter of 1955 and 1956, 9,568 were bred, with a conception rate of over 81%. Last year, the county produced 2,579 foals and calves, with a survival rate of 93%.
    After agricultural cooperativization, Weinan County regarded draught animal breeding as a fundamental measure to solve the widespread shortage of draught animals. The county's Party and government leading departments frequently arranged and inspected draught animal breeding work, and widely publicized that animal power is a major driving force in China's agricultural production both now and in the future, and also a major asset of agricultural cooperatives, aiming at correcting the mistaken ideas among farmers such as "With tractors, why bother with livestock? Breeding costs money and is troublesome." In May of last year, the county launched a month-long campaign for a concentrated draught animal breeding drive. In the Chongning District, over 55% of the female animals were bred during this month. The general breeding rate in the county reached over 31%.
    In order to achieve "guaranteed breeding, guaranteed pregnancy, and guaranteed survival" in draught animal breeding, Weinan County universally organized "folk studs" (farmers who raise breeding animals), veterinarians, and agricultural cooperatives to sign contracts, with each party responsible for its own duties. After signing contracts, the conception rate of 2,792 draught animals throughout the county increased. For example, after the fifteen agricultural cooperatives in Shijiazhuang, Xinyi Township, signed contracts with folk studs and veterinarians, 123 out of 126 female animals bred conceived, reaching a conception rate of 97%. Some agricultural cooperatives also designated special personnel to monitor the estrus of female animals, striving for timely breeding, continuous breeding, and repeated breeding if one attempt failed. Hongqi No. 2 Cooperative in Yuanqu Township also established a registry for the estrus of female animals, ensuring timely breeding. This agricultural cooperative also gave the feeders the authority to mobilize livestock for work, taking care of the health of the female animals. As a result, all 39 female animals in the cooperative were successfully bred and remained pregnant, and three of them even had two pregnancies in one year, and all 15 calves born also survived.
    Weinan County also reasonably solved the labor remuneration for personnel breeding and raising draught animals, giving play to their work enthusiasm, so as to ensure abundant draught animal production. In the early stages of the animal breeding campaign, many agricultural cooperatives were unwilling to breed female animals for fear of affecting production; some feeders thought that caring for calves and female animals was too tiring and troublesome; and folk stud households also felt that raising breeding animals was useless and preferred to change careers. In response to this situation, in addition to publicizing the importance of breeding draught animals to farmers, Weinan County focused on solving the wage remuneration for folk stud households and the labor remuneration for feeders, so that they could increase their income. It was also stipulated that during the upgrading and merging of cooperatives, all old, weak, and young animals should be taken over by the cooperative, and no exclusion was allowed. In addition, appropriate provisions were made for the feed of breeding animals.
    In the use of draught animals, the agricultural cooperatives in Weinan County also took care of the health and rest of the bred female animals, and fed the young animals separately. For example, Suwu Cooperative in Tianshi Township paid attention to the use of female animals, and all 16 female animals of breeding age in the cooperative were successfully bred and remained pregnant.
    In the past year, Weinan County has carried out draught animal appraisal work in every cooperative and every township, and has widely rewarded advanced workers and units in the work of feeding and breeding draught animals.
    (Reported by this newspaper) The livestock in Jianhua Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiajia Township, Wudi County, Shandong Province, is numerous, large, and strong. In the past year, not a single draught animal in the cooperative has died due to illness or other abnormal causes.
    In the past, the protection and breeding of draught animals in this agricultural cooperative was unmanaged and unattended. The cooperative committee discovered this serious situation and decided to mobilize and educate all members to care for draught animals, and correct the chaotic phenomenon of excluding young animals, etc. The cooperative cadres repeatedly conducted ideological education for the members in light of practical examples, explaining that the cooperative has a lot of land and little labor, and without a large number of draught animals, production cannot be increased. The cooperative cadres also specifically calculated the accounts for breeding young animals for the members: The cooperative has five breeding animals and four hundred female animals. If two hundred animals can be bred each year after breeding, and sold after raising them for one year, it can sell for 15,000 yuan. If raised for two years, they can plow the fields and pull carts, and can also accumulate more than 1,000 carts of fertilizer each year. After such education, the members became particularly concerned about feeding the livestock well. The cooperative also established a livestock breeding management committee, and each production team established a feeding management team. The cooperative selected members who love draught animals and have feeding management experience as feeders; the remuneration for the feeders was also reasonably stipulated to ensure that their income increased.
    In order to breed a large number of draught animals, it is now stipulated: Those who make the female animals pregnant will be given five more workdays per animal. After the mule, horse, donkey foal, and calf live for half a year, bonuses will be issued separately. If miscarriage or death is caused by poor care, criticism or punishment will be given. In this way, each feeder can get nearly 300 workdays throughout the year. The adoption of these measures has stimulated the enthusiasm of the feeders.
    It is not enough to just feed them well. The cooperative also divides the draught animals into first, second, and third grades according to their size and strength, and stipulates different work quotas. If the quota is exceeded without following the regulations, no work points will be recorded, and criticism will also be given; if the draught animals are damaged or die due to excessive use, the user will be responsible. Now, it has become a common practice for members to care for draught animals.
    In this cooperative, the work of breeding young animals is also valued. Last year, the cooperative concentrated two stallions and three breeding donkeys together and established a breeding station. In the past year, 350 female animals were mated, and it was confirmed that 210 were pregnant. All of them will be born this spring. (Attached picture)

    牛马兴旺增产有望
    渭南县繁殖耕畜有成绩  建华社爱护耕畜成风气
    本报讯  陕西省渭南县在合作化后积极繁殖耕畜，基本上达到耕畜丰产县的要求。
    渭南县共有母畜一万七千一百二十七头，其中有繁殖能力的一万一千六百七十头。1955年冬和1956年，配种的有九千五百六十八头，受胎的81％以上。去年，全县产驹下犊两千五百七十九头，成活率达93％。
    渭南县在农业合作化以后把耕畜繁殖工作作为解决耕畜普遍缺乏的根本措施。县的党政领导部门经常布置和检查耕畜繁殖工作，并且针对农民中的“有了拖拉机，何必要牲口；配种要花钱，又麻烦”的错误思想，广泛宣传畜力在目前和将来都是我国农业生产中的主要动力，也是农业社的主要财富。去年5月，全县开展了耕畜突击配种运动月。崇凝区有55％以上的母畜，都在这个月里配了种。全县一般配种率达到了31％以上。
    为了在繁殖耕畜中做到“保配、保胎、保成活”，渭南县普遍组织民桩（养种畜的农民）、兽医和农业社签订合同，三方面各负专责。签订合同以后，全县共有两千七百九十二头耕畜受胎率提高。例如信义乡石家庄十五个农业社在与民桩和兽医签订合同以后，配种的一百二十六头母畜，就有一百二十三头受胎，受胎率达到97％。一些农业社还指定专人负责掌握母畜发情情况，争取及时配、连续配、一次配不上就再配一次。员曲乡红旗二社，还建立了母畜发情登记簿，做到及时配种。这个农业社又给饲养员以调动牲畜使役的权力，照顾了母畜健康。结果，全社三十九头母畜全部配种保胎，其中有三头还是一年两胎，生下的十五头牛犊也全部成活。
    渭南县还合理解决了繁殖、饲养耕畜人员的劳动报酬，发挥他们的工作积极性，以保证耕畜丰产。在繁殖牲畜运动初期，不少农业社怕影响生产，不愿意给母畜配种；有些饲养员认为照管牛犊和母畜太劳累、太麻烦；民桩户也觉得养种畜没处用，不如改行。针对这一情况，除了向农民宣传繁殖耕畜的重要意义外，渭南县着重解决了民桩户的工资报酬和饲养员的劳动报酬问题，使他们能增加收入。又规定升社、并社当中，对老、弱和幼畜，全部由社包下来，不许排斥。此外，对种畜的饲料也作了适当的规定。
    在使役耕畜当中，渭南县的农业社还照顾配种后的母畜健康和休息，并对幼畜分槽喂养。例如田市乡苏武社由于注意使役母畜，全社十六头适龄母畜全都配种保胎。
    渭南县一年来，社社、乡乡都开展了耕畜评比工作，对饲养、繁殖耕畜工作中的先进工作者和单位，广泛进行了奖励。
    本报讯  山东省无棣县贾家乡建华农业生产合作社里的牲口，又多、又大、又肥壮。全社七百七十六头耕畜，一年来没有一头耕畜因病或其它非正常原因死亡。
    过去，这个农业社对耕畜的保护和繁殖，无人管理过问。社委会发现了这一严重情况，决定发动和教育全体社员关心爱护耕畜，纠正排斥幼畜等混乱现象。社干部结合着实际事例，反复地向社员进行了思想教育，说明社里地多劳动力少，如果没有大批耕畜使用，就不能增产。社干部还向社员具体算了一下繁殖幼畜的账：全社五头种畜，四百头母畜，配种后，如每年能繁殖二百头，养活一年后，可卖一万五千元，养活二年，就可以耕田拉车，每年还能积一千多车肥。经过这样教育后，社员们对喂好牲畜特别关心了。社内又建立了畜牧饲养管理委员会，各个生产队内建立饲养管理小组，全社选择了爱护耕畜、又有饲养管理经验的社员当饲养员；对饲养员的报酬也做了合理规定，保证他们的收入增加。
    为了大量繁殖耕畜，今年又规定：凡使母畜怀住驹的，每头再算五个工日。骡、马、驴驹及牛犊活到半年后，再分别发给奖金。如因护理不善，造成流产或死亡，即进行批评或处罚。这样，每个饲养员全年可得近三百个工日。采取这些措施后，激发了饲养员的积极性。
    单靠喂养好，还不行，社里还按耕畜的大小强弱，分成一、二、三级，规定不同的作活定额。如不按规定超过定额不多记工，还要受批评；如因使用过度，耕畜有损伤或死亡，由使用者负责。现在，社员们关心爱护耕畜，已成为一种风气。
    在这个社里，繁殖幼畜工作也被重视起来了。去年，社里把两头种马三头种驴集中在一起，设立了一处配种站。一年来交配三百五十头母畜，证实保驹的达二百一十头，今春可全部下生。（附图片）
