    Congratulating Ghana on its Independence
    Today, on the African continent, another flag of freedom is raised! The more than four million six hundred thousand people of Ghana (Gold Coast) are celebrating the independence of their motherland. All people who love freedom and independence are also cheering for the birth of this new country. Our special envoy, Marshal Nie Rongzhen, has arrived in Accra, the capital of Ghana, and will participate in the Ghana Independence Day celebrations to express warm congratulations to the government and people of Ghana.
    Africa is a vast continent with endless riches. However, the people of African countries have long suffered the barbaric plunder of Western colonial countries, living a life of poverty and suffering. Western colonial countries have always called Africa the "Dark Continent," treating it as a place for them to get rich. Western monopoly capitalist groups extract staggering profits in Africa. Africa produces 98% of the world's diamonds, 80% of cobalt, 60% of gold, 70% of cocoa and chocolate, 20% of copper, and 30% of manganese every year, all of which are plundered by Western colonial countries. In order to guarantee their huge profits and maintain their enslavement of the African people, the colonialists built countless prisons, concentration camps, and military bases on the African continent, brutally suppressing the resistance of the African people.
    However, the people of African countries have not remained silent. They have always held high the banner of striving for independence and freedom in the face of violent oppressors. Especially after the Second World War, the national independence movements in African countries have developed even further. From Kenya to the Gold Coast, from Cameroon to Algeria, almost the entire continent is seething. In addition to Egypt and Ethiopia, which were originally independent countries, Sudan, Morocco, and Tunisia successively gained independence in 1956. Now, the people of Ghana have stood up again and achieved a great victory in national independence. The successive embarkation of African countries on the road to independence is one of the greatest events in human history, and it has great significance for the oppressed people of Africa and the world.
    Ghana's independence is the result of a long and heroic struggle by the people of the Gold Coast against the colonialists. The people of the Gold Coast suffered nearly five hundred years of colonial rule. In the post-war years, the colonialists still tried to suppress the struggle of the people of the Gold Coast for national independence. However, the powerful independence movement of the people of the Gold Coast finally forced the British government to concede and agree to make the Gold Coast an independent member of the Commonwealth. According to the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly on December 13, 1956, the British-administered Togoland region was also incorporated into the Gold Coast. Thus, Ghana, named after an ancient West African independent kingdom, was born. The people of Ghana should of course feel proud and elated by the victory they have achieved. However, the people of Ghana also deeply know that the independence of their motherland still needs to be further consolidated and developed. As Ghanaian Prime Minister Kwame Nkrumah said, "Now that we have gained freedom, the first thing we must do is to very carefully defend this independence." There is no doubt that all the efforts made by the people of Ghana in carrying out peaceful construction and seeking independent development will be supported by the people of the world, especially the people of Asian and African countries.
    Although China and Ghana are far apart, the will of our two peoples to love peace, independence, and freedom is the same. The closeness of our two peoples did not just begin now. At the famous Asian-African Conference, the leaders of our two countries had friendly contacts. On this day of Ghana's independence, the Chinese people extend our heartfelt respect and congratulations to the people of Ghana with excitement and affection.

### 祝贺加纳独立

    祝贺加纳独立
    今天，在非洲大陆上，又一面自由的旗帜升起来了！加纳（黄金海岸）四百六十多万人民正在欢庆自己祖国的独立。一切爱好自由和独立的人们也都为这个新国家的诞生而欢呼。我国特使聂荣臻元帅已经到达加纳首都阿克拉，将参加加纳庆祝独立典礼，向加纳政府和人民表示热烈的祝贺。
    非洲是一个辽阔的大陆，它有着无尽的富藏。但是，非洲各国人民长期遭受西方殖民国家的野蛮掠夺，过着贫穷的痛苦生活。西方殖民国家一向把非洲叫做“黑暗大陆”，把非洲当做它们发财致富的地方。西方垄断资本集团在非洲榨取着惊人的利润。非洲每年出产的金刚石占世界产量的98％，钴占80％，金占60％，可可和巧克力占70％，铜占20％，锰占30％，全部都被西方殖民国家所掠夺。殖民主义者为了保障他们巨额的利润，维持他们对非洲人民的奴役统治，在非洲大陆上建筑了无数监狱、集中营和军事基地，残酷地镇压非洲人民的反抗。
    但是，非洲各国人民并没有沉默下来。他们在强暴的压迫者面前始终高擎着争取独立自由的旗帜。特别是在第二次世界大战以后，非洲各国的民族独立运动有了更大的发展。从怯尼亚到黄金海岸，从喀麦隆到阿尔及利亚，差不多整个大陆都沸腾起来了。除埃及和埃塞俄比亚等原来独立的国家以外，苏丹、摩洛哥、突尼斯在1956年相继获得了独立。现在，加纳的人民又站起来了，取得了民族独立的伟大胜利。非洲各国人民相继走上独立的道路，是人类历史上最伟大的事件之一，它对非洲和全世界被压迫的人民都有重大的意义。
    加纳取得独立，是黄金海岸人民同殖民主义者进行长期和英勇斗争的结果。黄金海岸人民遭受了将近五百年的殖民统治。在战后年代中，殖民主义者仍力图镇压黄金海岸人民争取民族独立的斗争。可是，声势浩大的黄金海岸人民的独立运动，终于迫使英国政府让步，并同意使黄金海岸成为英联邦的一个独立的成员国。根据1956年12月13日联合国大会的决议，英国托管的多哥地区也并入黄金海岸。于是，这个以古代西非洲独立王国的名字命名的加纳便诞生了。加纳人民当然要为他们所取得的胜利而感到骄傲和欢欣鼓舞。但是，加纳人民也深深地知道，它们祖国的独立还有待于继续巩固和发展。正如加纳总理恩克鲁玛所说：“现在我们已经获得了自由，我们必须作的第一件事情，就是要非常小心地保卫这种独立。”毫无疑问，加纳人民在进行和平建设和谋求独立发展的道路上所作的一切努力，将得到全世界人民首先是亚非各国人民的支持。
    中国和加纳两国相距虽然遥远，但是我们两国人民爱好和平、独立和自由的意志是相同的。我们两国人民的接近，并不是从现在才开始。在著名的亚非会议上，我们两国的领导人就有过友好的接触。在此加纳独立的日子里，中国人民怀着兴奋和亲切的心情向加纳人民遥致衷心的敬意和祝贺。
