Director Yang of the Commercial Bureau of a certain county in Hunan Province took out some official documents from his desk drawer to review. As he read and made notes, he suddenly burst into laughter. Why was Director Yang laughing? It turned out that he had just seen five notices in a row like this:

    The first one, from the Provincial Department of Commerce, was about: Regulations concerning the cotton cloth purchase ticket measuring stick.

    The second one, from the Provincial Textile Company (copied), was also about: Regulations concerning the cotton cloth purchase ticket measuring stick.

    The third one, from the Prefectural Commercial Bureau, was still about: Regulations concerning the cotton cloth purchase ticket measuring stick.

    The fourth one, from the Special District Textile Company (copied), was still about: Regulations concerning the cotton cloth purchase ticket measuring stick.

    The fifth one, from the County Textile Company (copied), was no different from the above four.

Although this happened in January, regrettably, similar phenomena have not disappeared to this day.

　　杨局长的笑声
　　徐醒余
    湖南省某县商业局杨局长，从自己办公桌的抽屉里拿出一些公文来审阅。他批着、批着，突然发出了一阵笑声。杨局长为什么好笑呢？原来是他刚才一连看到了五个这样的通知：
    第一个，省商业厅来的，内容是：有关棉布收票折尺的规定。
    第二个，省纺织品公司来的（抄送），内容也是：有关棉布收票折尺的规定。
    第三个，专署商业局来的，内容还是：有关棉布收票折尺的规定。
    第四个，专区纺织品公司来的（抄送），内容仍然是：有关棉布收票折尺的规定。
    第五个，县纺织品公司来的（抄送），内容与上述四个不差分毫。
    这件事情虽然发生在1月间，但遗憾的是，类似现象至今并未绝迹。
