Reactions to Criticism
    The Hubei Provincial Department of Water Resources wrote: After the "People's Daily" published the article "A Document with a Mismatched Title" on October 27, 1956, on the fourth page, our department immediately sent people to the Wuchang County Water Resources Bureau to investigate. It turned out that the copyist mistakenly wrote "to do a good job in 'management and maintenance'" as "to do a good job in 'soil and water conservation'." We have already educated the relevant staff.

　　对批评的反应
    湖北省水利厅来信：1956年10月27日“人民日报”第四版发表“题文不符的公文”一文后，我厅立即派人到武昌县水利局进行了解。原来是缮写员把“为做好‘管理养护’工作”误写成“为做好‘水土保持’工作”，我们已对有关工作人员进行了教育。
