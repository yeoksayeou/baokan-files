Xinhua News Agency, March 27th: Czechoslovakian Prime Minister Viliam Široký told Chinese and foreign reporters in Beijing today that Czechoslovakia, the western outpost of the great socialist camp, and China, the eastern outpost, have consistent views on the issues discussed in their bilateral talks. Both sides hold common views on the relations between socialist countries.

When asked about the conclusions reached on international issues during the Sino-Czech prime ministers' talks, Prime Minister Široký replied that they had concluded that international tension cannot be eased by strengthening aggressive treaties; only by eliminating such treaties can genuine cooperation be achieved.

Prime Minister Široký said that they had noted with great attention that although the imperialist aggressors suffered a clear defeat in Egypt, and although their attempts to split the solidarity of the socialist camp also failed, some groups still want to intensify international tension.

He cited the further strengthening of the North Atlantic Treaty and the role of West German militarism within this treaty as proof.

Secondly, the United States joined the Baghdad Pact.

The third proof is the Eisenhower Doctrine announced by the United States not long ago. The purpose of this doctrine is to implement new colonialism by harming the interests of old-line colonialist countries and conquering Middle Eastern countries.

Prime Minister Široký said that the most profound impression of this visit to China on him and the members of the Czechoslovak government delegation was the complete unity of all strata of the Chinese people, namely the People's Democratic United Front under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.

He said that from this unity, they saw the Chinese people's unstoppable efforts to build their country into an industrial power, develop agricultural cooperativization, agricultural production, and culture. From this unity, one can see the guarantee for strengthening the solidarity between socialist countries, easing international tension, and striving for world peace.

When discussing the issue of economic cooperation between Czechoslovakia and China, Prime Minister Široký said that there are many favorable factors in the prospects for developing economic cooperation between the two countries. The two countries will develop economic cooperation on the basis of international division of labor and mutual benefit.

Before Prime Minister Široký answered questions from reporters, Foreign Minister David pointed out in his speech that the newly signed Sino-Czech Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation laid a good foundation for the further development of friendly cooperative relations between the two countries. This treaty is also a contribution to world peace and the cause of friendship between peoples of all countries. He firmly believes that the Czechoslovak people will welcome this treaty with joy and excitement.

When answering a question about cultural cooperation between the two countries, David said that Czechoslovakia will support the exchange of delegations and scholars in science, culture and art, education, sports, journalism, etc., in order to learn from each other, exchange experiences, and thereby deepen mutual understanding.

    西罗基总理对中外记者说
　　中捷会谈对各项问题看法一致
    新华社27日讯　捷克斯洛伐克共和国总理西罗基今天在北京对中外记者说，伟大的社会主义阵营的西方前哨捷克斯洛伐克和东方前哨的中国对它们双方的会谈中所涉及的问题具有共同一致的看法。双方对于社会主义各国之间的关系，抱有共同的见解。
    在记者问到关于中捷两国总理会谈中关于国际问题有那些结论时，西罗基总理回答说，我们得出的结论是国际紧张局势是不可能靠加强侵略性的条约来缓和的，只有消除这种条约才能获得真诚的合作。
    西罗基总理说，我们十分注意到帝国主义侵略者虽然在埃及受到明显的失败，虽然他们分裂社会主义阵营团结的企图也遭到了失败，但是有一些集团仍想加剧国际紧张局势。
    他举例说，进一步加强北大西洋公约和西德军国主义在这个公约中的作用就是一个证明。
    其次是美国加入了巴格达条约。
    第三个证明就是美国不久以前所宣布的艾森豪威尔主义。这个主义的目的是想靠损害老牌殖民主义国家的利益，和征服中近东国家，来实行新的殖民主义。
    西罗基总理说，这次访问中国给他和捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团成员最深刻的印象是中国各阶层人民的完全团结一致，即在中国共产党领导之下的人民民主统一战线。
    他说从这种团结一致，他们看到中国人民为把自己的国家建设成为一个工业大国，发展农业合作化，农业生产和文化方面的不可阻挠的努力。从这种团结一致，可以看到加强社会主义国家之间的团结，缓和国际紧张局势，争取世界和平的保证。
    在谈到捷中两国经济合作问题时，西罗基总理说，在发展两国经济合作的远景中有很多有利因素。两国将在国际分工和互利的基础上发展经济合作。
    在西罗基总理回答记者提出的问题以前，外交部长戴维在他的讲话中指出，刚刚签订的中捷友好合作条约为两国之间的友好合作关系的进一步发展打下了良好的基础。这个条约也是对世界和平和各国人民友好事业的贡献。他深信捷克斯洛伐克人民将怀着欢欣鼓舞的心情来欢迎这个条约。
    戴维在回答关于两国之间的文化合作的问题时说，捷克斯洛伐克将支持两国交换科学、文化艺术、教育、体育、新闻等方面的代表团和学者，以互相学习，交流经验，从而加深彼此间的了解。
