Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 28th – Following an intensive manure accumulation drive last winter and this spring, Shaanxi Province has transitioned manure accumulation into a regular practice.

Since last winter, agricultural cooperatives in Shaanxi Province have adopted methods such as renovating well platforms and digging manure pile bases to accumulate fertilizer. They have also conducted short-term manure accumulation competitions through manure accumulation movement weeks and movement fortnights, resulting in some progress in manure accumulation. According to statistics from more than 40 counties including Lantian and Weinan, over 9 billion jin of manure has already been accumulated. However, in the past period, various localities focused more on intensive manure accumulation. Due to the short time and small scope of accumulation, the amount of manure accumulated is far from meeting the needs of spring planting, and the quality of fertilizer is also poor. Heyang County originally planned to accumulate more than 900 million jin of fertilizer before spring plowing, but as of now, only more than 600 million jin has been accumulated. In many mountainous areas in southern and northern Shaanxi, each mu of cultivated land has only more than 100 jin of fertilizer. The quality of the fertilizer is also poor. In Qishan County, the fertilizer accumulated last winter had a ratio of manure to soil of one to six, forming a situation of "moving yellow soil."

In order to make up for the shortcomings of small quantity and poor quality of intensive manure accumulation, various localities in the province are currently taking various measures to expand fertilizer sources and improve fertilizer quality, and are integrating manure accumulation into routine practice. In order to accumulate more fertilizer, agricultural cooperatives in the Hanzhong area of southern Shaanxi have currently raised more than 540,000 pigs, an increase of more than 50,000 compared with last autumn. The Yulin area of northern Shaanxi plans to raise more than 140,000 pigs this year. Places that never raised pigs in the past, such as Zhidan and Yijun counties, have also begun to raise pigs. In order to regularly accumulate human waste and urine, more than 4,000 toilets have been added in five counties including Zhashui and Suide, and some counties have also added manure pits and composting pits. Agricultural cooperatives in Liuba, Huayin, Chang'an and other counties are preparing to promote contracting livestock, pigs, and toilets to supply manure for cultivated land. In this way, the fertilizer needs of most farmland can be solved. Dali County adopted this method, and the fertilizer shortage problem for 67% of the county's farmland planting area has been resolved.

### 陕西省积肥转入经常化

    陕西省积肥转入经常化
    新华社西安28日电  陕西省各地在去冬今春开展突击性的积肥后，已经把积肥工作转入经常化。
    去冬以来，陕西省各地农业社采取起井台和挖粪堆底等方法积肥，并通过积肥运动周、运动旬，开展了短期积肥竞赛，使积肥工作有了一定成绩。据蓝田、渭南等四十多个县的统计，目前已积肥九十多亿斤。但是，过去这一段时间里，各地多偏重于突击性的积肥，由于时间短、积肥范围小，积肥数量还远不能满足春播的需要，另外肥料质量也较差。郃阳县原定在春耕前积肥九亿多斤，但截至目前，只积了六亿多斤，陕南、陕北许多山区每亩耕地仅有肥料一百多斤。肥料质量也差。岐山县去冬所积的肥料，粪土是一与六之比，形成黄土搬家。
    为了弥补突击积肥量少、质差的缺点，目前这个省各地正在采取各种措施扩大肥源和提高肥料质量，并把积肥工作转入经常化。陕南汉中专区的农业社为了多积肥料，目前已养猪五十四万多头，较去年秋季增加了五万多头；陕北榆林专区今年计划养猪达十四万多头；志丹、宜君等县境内过去从来不养猪的地方也开始喂养起猪来。柞水、绥德等五县为了经常积攒人粪尿，已经增设厕所四千多个，有些县还添置了粪坑和沤肥坑等。留坝、华阴、长安等县的农业社准备推行牲畜、猪和厕所包干耕地用粪，这样，能够解决大部分农田所需肥料问题，大荔县采取这个办法，全县67％的农田种植面积缺肥问题已能解决。
