Xinhua News Agency, March 12th: Premier Viliam Široký was invited to deliver a speech at the Third Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) this afternoon.

Premier Viliam Široký said that there are solid friendly ties and comprehensive, genuine brotherly cooperation between the peoples of China and Czechoslovakia. He said that the great power of socialist thought has promoted the rapprochement between our nations and opened a new era in the relations between our two countries. The common struggle for socialism and peace has built a solid bridge of friendship, mutual respect, and comprehensive cooperation between our two countries, which are thousands of miles apart.

At 2:35 PM, Premier Viliam Široký, accompanied by Zhou Enlai, Chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, ascended the rostrum. At this moment, the entire audience stood up and applauded enthusiastically for five minutes to express their welcome to the distinguished guests. Also on the rostrum were members of the Czechoslovak government delegation, Vice-Chairmen and the Secretary-General of the CPPCC National Committee, Vice-Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Vice-Premiers of the State Council, the President of the Supreme People's Court, the Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the Vice-Chairman of the National Defense Council, and the Chinese Ambassador to Czechoslovakia.

Chairman Zhou Enlai delivered a welcoming speech at the meeting. He said that China and Czechoslovakia have increasingly broad cooperation in political, economic, and cultural fields. Over the past few years, China's economic construction has received much significant assistance from the people of Czechoslovakia. Zhou Enlai, on behalf of the Chinese people, expressed heartfelt thanks to the fraternal people of Czechoslovakia.

Zhou Enlai said that Czechoslovakia has a united front organization composed of various democratic parties and people's organizations—the National Front—under the leadership of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. It has done a great deal of work and achieved great success in coordinating with the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and the government to unite the people of the country in socialist construction and in supporting the government's peaceful foreign policy. We are very pleased to have the opportunity to meet with some of the leaders of the various democratic parties of Czechoslovakia who are in the delegation led by Premier Široký.

Premier Široký conveyed the fraternal respect of the Czechoslovak people, the National Front, and the government to the participants—representatives from all sectors of the Chinese people's democratic united front.

Premier Viliam Široký said that the historical traditions, current conditions, and different premises inevitably lead to many differences between China and Czechoslovakia in socialist construction. However, in fundamental and most important aspects, our paths are common and completely consistent because both of our countries are following the path of the great October Socialist Revolution. He highly praised the revolutionary and construction achievements of the Chinese people and the experiences they have gained, and introduced the construction achievements of the Czechoslovak people and the work of the Czechoslovak National Front.

Premier Široký expressed his indignation at the fact that the People's Republic of China is still being deprived of its legitimate right to representation in the United Nations. Premier Široký said that the government of the Czechoslovak Republic most resolutely condemns the United States for continuously escalating the tension in the Taiwan region and its aggressive policy of occupying Taiwan. He expressed unreserved agreement with the view that the issue of liberating Taiwan is China's internal affair. Premier Široký said that Premier Zhou Enlai's recent friendly visit to eleven countries in Asia and Europe has made a new and important contribution to further strengthening the solidarity and strength of the socialist camp and to further enhancing cooperation between socialist countries and nationally independent countries.

Premier Široký pointed out that the main driving forces in the world today are two powerful global currents. They have profound agreement and common interests on fundamental international issues. The continuous growth of the strength of the socialist camp is accelerating the collapse of world colonial (imperialist) rule and helping the free development of Asian and African countries liberated from this rule. On the other hand, the vigorous development of the liberation struggles of the people of Asia and Africa is shaking the positions of imperialism and strengthening the front of peace and progress in the world.

Premier Široký's speech was warmly welcomed.

Today, those who attended the speech delivered by Premier Široký included all attendees and observers of the Third Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC, members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the Secretary-General and Deputy Secretaries-General of the State Council, the heads of various offices, ministries, commissions, and directly affiliated institutions, the heads of the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, Czechoslovak experts in Beijing, and personnel from the Czechoslovak Embassy, totaling more than 1,300 people.

    中捷友谊　永恒长存
    西罗基总理应邀在政协全体会议上发表演说
    新华社12日讯　威廉·西罗基总理今天下午应邀在中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第三次全体会议上发表演说。
    威廉·西罗基总理说，中捷两国人民之间有着巩固的友好联系和全面的真正兄弟合作。他说，社会主义思想的伟大力量促进了我们民族间的接近，并为我们两国的相互关系开辟了新的纪元。争取社会主义和争取和平的共同斗争，在我们相距万里的两国之间架起了一座友谊、互相敬爱和全面合作的坚固桥梁。
    下午二时三十五分，威廉·西罗基总理由政协全国委员会主席周恩来陪同登上主席台。这时全场起立，热烈鼓掌达五分钟之久，向贵宾们表示欢迎。一同登上主席台的还有捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团团员们，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席和秘书长，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长，国务院副总理，最高人民法院院长，最高人民检察院检察长，国防委员会副主席和中国驻捷克斯洛伐克大使。
    周恩来主席在会上致欢迎词。他说，中捷两国在政治、经济、文化方面都有日益广泛的合作。几年来在我国的经济建设中，得到了捷克斯洛伐克人民的许多巨大的援助。周恩来代表中国人民向兄弟的捷克斯洛伐克人民表示衷心的感谢。
    周恩来说，捷克斯洛伐克有着以捷克斯洛伐克共产党为领导的由各民主党派、各人民团体所组成的统一战线组织——民族阵线。它在配合捷克斯洛伐克共产党和政府团结全国人民进行社会主义建设和支持政府和平外交政策中做了许多工作，并且取得了很大的成就。这次以西罗基总理为首的代表团中有些就是捷克斯洛伐克各民主党派的领导人，我们有机会和他们会见，感到十分高兴。
    西罗基总理向与会者——中国的人民民主统一战线各界代表们转达了捷克斯洛伐克人民、民族阵线和政府的兄弟敬意。
    威廉·西罗基总理说，历史的传统、当前的条件和前提的不同，必然使中国和捷克斯洛伐克在社会主义建设中有许多不同之点，可是在根本性和最主要的方面我们的道路是共同的，是完全一致的，因为我们两国都是走的伟大十月社会主义革命的道路。他盛赞了中国人民的革命和建设成就以及所取得的经验，并且介绍了捷克斯洛伐克人民的建设成就和捷克斯洛伐克民族阵线的工作情况。
    西罗基总理对中华人民共和国仍被剥夺了在联合国中的合法代表权利一事表示愤慨。西罗基总理说，捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府最坚决地谴责美国不断加剧台湾地区的紧张局势和占踞台湾的侵略政策。他表示毫无保留地同意这观点：解放台湾问题是中国的内政。西罗基总理说，周恩来总理最近对亚洲和欧洲十一个国家的友好访问，是中国对进一步加强社会主义阵营的团结和力量，对进一步增强社会主义国家和民族独立的国家之间的合作作了新的重要的贡献。
    西罗基总理指出，目前世界上主要的推动力量是两股强大的世界性的激流。它们在原则性的国际问题上有着深刻的一致和共同的利益。社会主义阵营力量的不断增长加速着世界殖民（帝国）主义统治的崩溃，并有助于从这种统治下解放出来的亚非国家的自由发展。另一方面，亚非各国人民解放斗争的蓬勃发展动摇着帝国主义的阵地并加强着世界上和平和进步的战线。
    西罗基总理的演说受到了热烈的欢迎。
    今天出席听西罗基总理演说的，有政协第二届全国委员会第三次全体会议全体出席、列席人员，全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员，国务院秘书长、副秘书长，各办公室、各部、各委员会和各直属机构负责人，最高人民法院和最高人民检察院负责人，在京的捷克斯洛伐克专家和捷克斯洛伐克使馆人员，共一千三百多人。（附图片）
