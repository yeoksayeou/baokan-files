Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The Japanese Diet's House of Representatives passed the government's proposed 1957 budget draft on the afternoon of the 9th. The House of Representatives has already submitted this draft to the House of Councillors for deliberation.

This new budget, formulated by the former Ishibashi Cabinet, is the largest budget in Japan's post-war history. Both revenue and expenditure are 1,137.4 billion yen, an increase of over 102.5 billion yen compared to the 1956 fiscal year. According to this budget, state investment and loans that benefit capitalists will increase by more than 63.3 billion yen compared to the 1956 fiscal year, and military spending will also increase. This budget also implements a 100 billion yen tax cut that benefits the wealthy.

After the House of Representatives passed the budget draft, the Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement pointing out that this budget would cause inflation. The lives of most Japanese people with an annual income of less than 500,000 yen will be threatened by the government's increase in freight rates and rising prices.

    日本众议院通过新预算草案
    社会党指出这个预算将引起通货膨胀
    据新华社讯　日本国会众议院9日下午通过了政府提出的1957年度的预算草案。众议院已经把这个草案交给参议院审议。
    这个由前石桥内阁制订的新预算是日本战后规模最庞大的一个预算。岁出和岁入都为一万一千三百七十四亿日元，比1956年度增加了一千零二十五亿日元以上。根据这个预算，有利于资本家的国家投资和贷款比1956年度增加了六百三十三亿日元以上，军费也有了增加。这个预算中还要实行有利于收入富裕的阶层的一千亿日元减税。
    日本社会党在众议院通过这个预算草案后发表声明指出，这个预算将会引起通货膨胀。大多数一年收入不到五十万日元的日本人民的生活将由于政府提高运费和物价上涨等而受到威胁。
