　　Political Consultative Conference Work Requires Initiative and Depth
　　He Naiyang Discusses the Future Working Methods of the Changzhou Municipal Political Consultative Conference
　　Since I attended the conference as a non-voting delegate, I have been greatly educated and encouraged. Please allow me to express some thoughts and opinions, and I welcome criticism and corrections.
　　This time, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held its Second Session of the Third National Committee, and as many as 272 responsible cadres from provincial and municipal local political consultative conferences were invited to attend as non-voting delegates, which is unprecedented in history. It was even more unexpected that a local political consultative conference would be invited to participate in the Supreme State Conference and hear Chairman Mao's two cordial speeches. It can be seen that in the future, the work of local political consultative conferences will definitely be more concerned and supported by the Party and government. Therefore, how can we, who are responsible for the work of local political consultative conferences, be satisfied with receiving this great honor? We should be more inspired to make due achievements for the local united front work in the future.
　　The conference is not far from closing. At the meeting, I have heard many special reports made by responsible comrades from the central government, and I have also heard many committee members' analysis and suggestions on current issues. In particular, I heard the instructions made by the great leader Chairman Mao on the correct handling of contradictions among the people. This great instruction is the development of Marxism-Leninism and the historical experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Using this principle to analyze and solve many problems within the people can be easily solved. However, with my level, it is still very difficult to fully understand the instructions and reports I have heard. Therefore, my first step is to seriously study these many instructions and reports. Only through continuous study and self-transformation can I truly understand and integrate them. Only by being able to integrate the spirit and essence of these many instructions and reports can I return to my job and play the role of the political consultative conference as an assistant to the Party and the government, mobilize all positive factors, solve the existing contradictions, and promote the cause of socialist construction.
　　Our Changzhou City in Jiangsu Province, like other small and medium-sized cities in various provinces, has achieved great results in recent years under the correct leadership of the Party and the government in increasing production and practicing economy, agricultural issues, political and legal work, education work, etc. However, it cannot be said that there are no contradictions in various issues. All work is constantly progressing, and difficulties are bound to be encountered in the process of progress. Old contradictions are resolved, and new contradictions arise. The work of the local political consultative conference has close relations with local Party and government organs, groups, and social democrats. In other words, there is a lot of work waiting for our political consultative conference to unite, educate, adjust, and promote in various aspects of organs, groups, social enterprises. It seems that it does not matter if the political consultative conference does not do anything, but it also feels that it cannot be done exhaustively. If you can take the initiative to devote yourself to work, you can discover many problems through in-depth understanding. Once the problems are exposed, we can use the role of our political consultative conference and help solve these problems based on the Party's policies. It is not enough to sit and talk; we must take action. However, action must also be planned and step-by-step to carry out the work in an orderly manner. Therefore, I will talk about my working methods after I go back.
　　I said, first, we must first summarize the work in 1956 and determine the tasks for the future. Only by examining our own work on the original basis, affirming the achievements, pointing out the shortcomings, and then determining the direction of future work based on the specific local conditions, can we avoid deviating from reality and gradually improve. Second, doing the work of the political consultative conference is the same as other work, we must mobilize the masses and promote democracy. The method is to first convene a plenary meeting of the political consultative conference to conduct in-depth discussions, carry out criticism and self-criticism. Only when the awareness of each member is improved can we give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses and push the work of the political consultative conference forward. Third, in addition to continuously improving the quality of consultation, conducting in-depth inspections and contacts in various aspects, giving play to the special research of the working group, and strengthening the study of political theory, the current central work of the political consultative conference must focus on political and ideological education. After the three major upsurges, the antagonistic contradictions of classes basically no longer exist. The current contradictions are mostly contradictions among the people. The method of resolving contradictions among the people is mainly to proceed from the desire for unity, strive for new unity through criticism and struggle. By constantly helping each other and gradually improving political awareness, and clarifying the problems, the difficulties hindering our socialist progress will be overcome one after another.
　　Finally, I feel that so many local political consultative conference workers are attending this time, which also shows the importance of local political consultative conference work in the future. However, the local political consultative conference institutions are generally not sound enough so far. I suggest that the central leadership promptly stipulate the establishment of local political consultative conferences, and stipulate that one or two vice-chairmen or standing committee members be stationed in the office. In this way, the role of the political consultative conference can be gradually brought into play better. That is to say, the political consultative conference can contribute a certain amount of strength to socialist construction and socialist transformation. (Attached picture)

### 政协工作需要主动和深入　何乃扬谈常州市今后政协工作方法

　　政协工作需要主动和深入
　　何乃扬谈常州市今后政协工作方法
    我自列席大会以来，受到的教育和鼓舞非常之大，请容许我发表一些感想和意见，还望批评指正。
    这一次全国人民政协召开二届三次全体会议，各省市地方政协负责干部被邀列席的达二百七十二名之多，这是历史上所没有过的。一个地方政协会被邀参加最高国务会议，并听到毛主席两次亲切讲话，更是意料所不及的。可知今后地方政协工作一定更为党政所关怀与支持了。因而我们负责地方政协工作者，岂能以受到这次莫大光荣而满足？我们更应该鼓起精神来为今后地方统战工作作出应有的成绩。
    现离大会闭幕为期不远。我在会上已听到中央负责同志所作的专题报告很多，又听到不少委员对当前问题的分析和建议。尤其是听到了伟大领袖毛主席所作正确解决人民内部矛盾的问题的指示。这个伟大指示是马克思列宁主义的发展，是无产阶级专政的历史经验。用这个原则指示去分析和解决人民内部许多问题，是可以迎刃而解的。但是以我的水平来全部领会所听到的指示和报告，有些地方还是很吃力的。所以，我第一步打算还要认真学习这许多指示和报告。只有经过不断的钻研和自我改造过程，才能心领神会融会贯通，也只有能够融会贯通了这许多指示和报告的精神实质，才能回到自己工作岗位去发挥政协是党和政府的助手作用，才能调动一切积极因素，解决当前存在的矛盾，为社会主义建设事业推进一步。
    我们江苏常州市地方和其他各省中小城市一样，近年来在党和政府的正确领导下，在增产节约、农业问题、政法工作、教育工作等成绩都很大。但是不能说各种问题没有矛盾了。各项工作都在不断的进步，进步中必定会遇到困难，老的矛盾解决了，又有新的矛盾发生。地方政协工作对当地党政机关团体和社会民主人士都有密切关系的。也就是说有不少关于机关团体社会企业各方面的工作等待着我们政协去团结，教育，调整和推动。政协工作不做似乎也无所谓，要做也觉得做不尽。你能主动的投入工作，就能够由深入了解而发现出许多问题。问题暴露了就可运用我们政协的作用，根据党的政策去帮助解决这许多问题。坐而言是不够的，一定要起而行，但是行动也得有计划和步骤，才能按部就班的进行工作。所以，我再来谈一谈我回去的工作方法。
    我说，第一、要先总结1956年的工作并定出今后的任务来。只有在原有的基础上去检查自己的工作，肯定成绩，指出缺点，再根据当地具体情况定出今后工作方向，才不致脱离实际，才能逐步提高。第二、做政协工作和其他工作一样，要发动群众，发扬民主。方式是可先召开政协全体委员会议来深入讨论，开展批评与自我批评。只有待各个委员自觉性提高了，才能发挥群众的积极性和创造性，把政协工作向前推进。第三、政协工作除了要不断提高协商质量，深入各方面视察和联系，发挥工作组专题研究，加强政治理论学习外，目前中心工作要抓紧政治思想教育。三大高潮以后，阶级的对抗性矛盾基本上不存在了，现在的矛盾大都不外是人民内部的矛盾。解决人民内部矛盾的方法主要以团结愿望出发，通过批评斗争，争取新的团结。由于不断的互相帮助逐步提高政治觉悟，把问题讲清楚了，阻碍我们社会主义前进的困难，会一个又一个的克服的。
    最后，我觉得这次地方政协工作人员列席如此之多，亦就说明了今后地方政协工作的重要性。但是，地方政协机构到现在一般还不够健全的。我建议中央领导迅速将地方政协编制规定下来，并要规定一两位副主席或常委驻会办公，这样，才能更好的逐步发挥出政协作用。也就是政协更能为社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业贡献出一定的力量。（附图片）
