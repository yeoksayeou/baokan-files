    (Reported by this newspaper) The Red Star Agricultural Cooperative in the Ninth District of Xian County, Hebei Province, has suffered from disasters for seven consecutive years, and the disaster last year was particularly severe. In order to help cooperative members overcome the famine, the cooperative promptly formulated a comprehensive production and conservation plan. First, the cooperative made a general conservation plan. Regarding food conservation, the cooperative plans to eat 45,000 jin of substitutes such as vegetable leaves and sweet potato leaves, which, calculated at five jin to one jin of grain, can save a total of 9,000 jin of grain. At the same time, it is required that the flour be ground coarser, so that an average of one jin of grain can be saved per person per month, and the cooperative can save 2,719 jin of grain per month. Regarding firewood conservation, the slogan "Lower your head when burning fire, save a cow a year" was put forward, requiring each household to save one jin of firewood per day. The 605 households in the cooperative can save more than 18,000 jin of firewood per month. In addition, weddings, funerals, and daily expenses should also be economized as much as possible, requiring everything to be simplified, and the saved money should be used for necessary and urgent production and living purposes. Under the principle of "running the cooperative diligently and thriftily," the spirit of doing things without spending money or doing more things with less money should be upheld, and expenses such as office expenses and the purchase of production tools should be saved.
    Next, the cooperative members also made their own conservation plans. More than 80% of the 605 households in the cooperative have already made plans. The cooperative members are working hard to implement the conservation plan and have achieved good results.

    红星农业社精打细算节约渡荒
    本报讯　河北省献县九区红星农业社连续七年受灾，去年灾情又很严重。为了使社员渡过灾荒，这个社及时制订了全面的生产节约渡荒计划。首先，社里作出了全社的节约计划。在节约粮食上，全社计划吃菜叶、山芋叶等代食品四万五千斤，如按五斤折一斤粮食计算，共可节约粮食九千斤。同时，要求磨面的时候磨粗一些，这样，平均每人每月可节约一斤粮食，全社每月可节约粮食二千七百十九斤。在节约烧柴上，提出“烧火低低头，一年省条牛”的节约口号，要求每户每天节约一斤柴，全社六百零五户，每月可节约柴一万八千多斤。另外，在婚丧嫁娶、日常开支上，也尽量节约，要求一切从简，把节余的钱用到必要的急需的生产和生活的用途上去。在“勤俭办社”的原则下，本着不花钱也办事、少花钱多办事的精神，节省办公费和购买生产工具等开支。
    接着，社员也订出了自己的节约计划。全社六百零五户已作好计划的占80％以上。社员们努力执行节约计划，并已取得了良好的成绩。
