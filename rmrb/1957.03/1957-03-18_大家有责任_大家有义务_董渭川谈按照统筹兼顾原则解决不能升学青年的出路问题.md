    Everyone Has Responsibility, Everyone Has Obligation
    Dong Weichuan Discusses Solving the Problem of Young People Unable to Continue Their Education According to the Principle of Overall Planning and Comprehensive Consideration
    I would like to talk about the problem of a certain number of young people who will be unable to continue their education after the summer vacation this year. Several committee members have already discussed this issue, and I will add some supplementary remarks. Because our socialist construction has been continuously progressing in recent years, and the people's economic life and demands for culture have been continuously improving, although schools at all levels have greatly increased every year, they cannot keep up with the people's needs. Many middle schools have implemented a two-shift system, but they still cannot accommodate the primary school graduates who apply for admission. Last year, national universities almost took in all high school graduates, and also allowed some employed cadres to apply, which caused many difficulties for higher education. Not only are the material conditions such as housing and experimental equipment not keeping up, but even the number of teachers is insufficient. They had no choice but to adopt large classes, which inevitably lowered the teaching level. These are all factual limitations. Not to mention that today we should not take the funds used for industrial construction to build more schools, even if schools were to increase significantly, whether advanced or intermediate, there would not be enough teachers. Therefore, it is entirely correct that the number of admissions to national universities this year has been slightly reduced compared to last year. This is precisely to ensure the quality of the reserve force being trained for construction.
    However, in this way, some high school graduates will not be able to enter universities, and at the same time, some junior high school graduates will not be able to enter high schools, and even more primary school graduates will not be able to enter junior high schools. This is a problem both from an individual and a national perspective. What will tens of thousands of teenage boys and girls, who already have a certain level of education, do if they cannot continue their education? If they are told to prepare for another year to re-apply, who will help them prepare? If they are to study on their own, do they have a good environment for self-study? If they lead a life of boredom and wandering, will it not be a great loss? If they are told to find employment, then what kind of employment? Who will arrange it for them? They have received general education in primary and secondary schools. Before engaging in a certain profession, do they need to make some preparations?
    I am very concerned about this issue, but the scope of my personal experience is too narrow to provide an overall solution. Now I will just talk about some fragmentary ideas that I have thought of as examples.
    Guiding Young People to Participate in Productive Labor
    Guiding young people to the countryside should be said to be a broad and correct path. After the high tide of agricultural cooperativization, rural cooperatives in various places lacked accountants and technicians. At this meeting, I heard some committee members say that some cooperative accountants cannot even write Arabic numerals correctly, and some cooperatives even use soybeans to calculate work points, and the soybeans are sometimes eaten by mice. To meet this need, could we hold some short-term training courses to give them some knowledge and skills in accounting and agricultural technology, and at the same time, educate them professionally to be content with working in rural areas? In recent years, there have been many cases proving that young people with a certain level of education have played a very good role in agricultural cooperatives. After this cultural army enters the countryside, it can also play an active role in eliminating illiteracy, improving farmers' culture, and promoting production, which is worthy of special attention by governments at all levels.
    From the perspective of education: in recent years, we have added many primary and secondary schools, but many teachers have not received professional education, and the quality of their work is not high; however, if we want to transfer them to study full-time for a period, there is no one to take over their work. To meet this need, if we hold some short-term training courses to give some young people who cannot continue their education some knowledge and skills related to education, and at the same time, educate them to be content with being people's teachers, this can replace some primary and secondary school teachers who leave their posts for study. In Beijing, you can see some high school graduates teaching in junior high schools, and their performance is very good. With more teachers, the system of rotational training for primary and secondary school teachers can be established.
    In addition, some newly established factories, mines, and enterprises need cadres with considerable cultural and scientific knowledge, and often recruit from various places. Various handicraft and service departments can also accommodate a part. If there is a comprehensive plan in advance within a province or city, it can also be trained and placed in different categories.
    Recommend the Establishment of a Joint Organization
    Work Together to Overcome Difficulties
    The above are just a few examples. From these examples, it seems that the problem can be solved. But this is no longer a purely educational issue, and cannot be solved by the education department alone. Could the relevant departments of each province and city establish a joint organization to gather the needs of all aspects of the province and city, make overall considerations for young people who cannot continue their education, and entrust the training tasks to the relevant units according to categories. For example, the training of primary and secondary school teachers can be entrusted to secondary and higher normal schools; the training of accountants and agricultural technicians can be entrusted to agricultural schools or agricultural organs. This will certainly generate problems such as housing, equipment, teachers, and funding, but because it is short-term, there should be ways to overcome the difficulties. As long as we ideologically recognize that solving this major problem is everyone's responsibility, everyone has an obligation to undertake it. Chairman Mao's principle of overall planning and comprehensive consideration should also be reflected in this issue.
    Can doing so find a way out for all out-of-school youth? This depends on the provinces and cities themselves to conduct investigations and research, and it is impossible to estimate it without any basis. Assuming that it can only solve a large part, or even a small part, it is better than letting it go unchecked. For those who are employed, a condition can also be attached, that is, those with excellent work performance can be allowed to continue their education and given time to prepare for the exam, so as not to make them think that once they are employed, they can no longer continue their education. If they go to continue their education, new graduates can come to replace them in the future.
    If there are some people who do not want to work but only want to prepare for continuing their education next year, the Ministry of Education can also be asked to stipulate methods, and the youth's alma mater or the school in their hometown can help them organize, give them a few extra lessons every week, and assign them homework, so that they will not waste their studies. After there are more new teachers, the work of the original teachers can be reduced, which gives them time to tutor those who are preparing to continue their education.
    Strengthen Labor Education and Production Technology Education
    The above is about the way out for a large number of young people who cannot continue their education. Below, it is also necessary to talk about the future, because this is not a problem for this year only, but also for next year and the year after. In order to enable future primary and secondary school graduates to have the knowledge, ability, and correct understanding suitable for employment when they cannot continue their education and go to work, we should strengthen labor education, basic production technology education, and political and ideological education in primary and secondary schools. With these foundations, they will have better conditions to go to work than today, and they can shorten the time for certain training, and some jobs may not require training. Strengthening these aspects of education is not solely for employment, but also greatly benefits further education. As for high schools, it seems that we can seriously discuss whether it is necessary to separate arts and sciences. If arts and sciences can be separated, whether for further education or employment, the foundation may be better than today. Marx opposed premature differentiation, which is correct, but is it too early to differentiate after graduating from junior high school? Aren't our various secondary technical schools of different nature a differentiation at the high school level?
    In summary, the state has no obligation to guarantee that everyone can continue their education, and no country has ever done so, but for a large number of teenage boys and girls who cannot continue their education, it is necessary to think of ways for them to find employment; although today there are no conditions to enable them to all be employed, we still hope to think of as many ways as possible.
    These opinions of mine may be unrealistic empty talk, and I hope everyone will give me more advice!

    大家有责任　大家有义务
    董渭川谈按照统筹兼顾原则解决不能升学青年的出路问题
    我想谈谈今年暑假后将有一定数量的青年不能升学的问题。前边已有几位委员谈过这个问题，我再作些补充。由于这几年来我们的社会主义建设在不断地进步，人民的经济生活和对文化的要求都在不断地提高，因而各级学校虽然每年都大量增加，可是赶不上人民的需要。很多中学施行了二部制，但还是容纳不了小学毕业的投考生。去年全国高等学校几乎把高中毕业生全包下来，还允许一部分在职的干部投考，这就给高等教育造成了许多困难，不光房舍、实验设备等等物质条件跟不上，连教师的数量也不够，不得已采取大班上课的方式，无形中就不免降低教学的水平，这都是事实上的限制。不要说在今天我们不应该把用之于工业建设的经费拿过来再多办学校，倘使学校再大量增加，不论是高级的、中级的，也没有那么多的教师。所以今年全国高等学校的招生数字比去年稍稍缩减，是完全正确的，这正是为了保证所培养的建设后备军的质量。
    不过这样一来，有若干高中毕业生就不能升入大学，同时有若干初中毕业生就不能升入高中，更有若干小学毕业生不能升入初中，这不论从个人看，从国家看，都是问题。多少万十几岁的男女青年，他们已经有了一定程度的文化水平，这些人不能升学干什么呢？要说让他们准备一年再投考，谁给他们准备呢？如果要他们自学，他们有没有好的自学环境？假使他们过起烦闷、游荡的生活来，是不是很大的损失？要说让他们就业，那末，就什么业呢？谁给他们安排呢？他们在小学、中学里受的都是些普通教育，在从事于某种职业以前，要不要作些准备呢？
    我很为这一问题焦虑，但是个人见闻的范围太狭小了，不可能提供全盘解决的办法。现在只就所想到的零碎意见，作为例子谈谈。
    引导青年参加生产劳动
    引导青年们走向农村，应当说是一条广阔的而且正确的道路。在农业合作化高潮到来之后，各地农村合作社里很缺少会计和技术员。在这次会上听到有委员说，有些合作社的会计连阿拉伯数字还写不对头，甚至有的合作社中还用黄豆计工分，而黄豆有时被耗子吃掉。为适应这一需要，是不是可以举办些短期训练班，给他们一些关于会计的、农业技术的知识和技能，同时对他们进行安心于农村工作的专业思想教育，近年来已有好多事例证明，有了一定文化程度的青年在农业合作社里已经起了很好的作用。这批文化大军走入农村之后，对于扫除文盲、提高农民文化、促进生产，也都能起积极的作用，是值得各级政府特别注意的。
    再从教育方面看：几年来我们增设了很多中、小学，但是有不少的教师没受过专业教育，工作的质量不高；可是要想调他们脱产学习一个时期，而又没有人接替他们的工作。为适应这一需要，假如举办些短期的训练班，给一部分不能升学的青年一些有关教育的知识技能，同时对他们进行安心于当人民教师的思想教育，这就可以替换一部分中、小学教师离职学习。在北京市就可以看到有些高中毕业生当初中的教师，并且他们的成绩很好。在多了一部分教师之后，中、小学教师的轮训制度，就可以建立起来。
    此外有些新成立的厂、矿、企业需要具有相当文化和科学知识的干部，常常到各地招考。各种手工业和服务部门也可以容纳一部分。如果事前在一省或一市之内有通盘的筹划，也可以作分门别类的训练和安置。
    建议成立联合机构
    共同设法克服困难
    以上只是举了几方面的例子。从这些例子看，问题是有可能解决的。但这已经不是单纯的教育问题，非教育一个部门所能解决。可不可以由各省、市的有关部门成立联合机构，把本省、本市各方面的需要汇集在一起，为不能升学的青年作总的考虑，并且按照门类把训练的任务分别交托给有关的单位。例如：训练中、小学的师资工作就可交给中等和高等师范学校负责；训练会计和农业技术人员的工作就可交给农业学校或农业机关负责。这当然也产生房舍、设备、教师、经费等等的问题，但因为是短期的，应当有办法克服困难。只要在思想上承认解决这一重大问题是大家的责任，大家就有义务来承当。毛主席指示的统筹兼顾的原则，在这一问题上，也应该体现出来。
    这样做能不能为全部失学的青年都找到出路呢？这要依靠各省、市自己去作调查研究，无法悬空估计。假定只能解决一大部分，甚或一小部分，也比听其自然的好。对于就业的人，也可附一个条件，就是工作成绩优良的，可以准许他们升学，并给他们以考试前的准备时间，以免他们认为就了业就再也不能升学了。他们去升学了，将来又可以有新的毕业生来接替。
    如果有些不愿工作只愿准备来年升学的人，也可请教育部规定办法，由这些青年的母校或者他们家乡的学校，帮他们组织起来，每星期给他们补几次课，并给他们指定作业，使他们不至荒废学业。在多了一部分新的教师之后，原有教师的工作可以减轻，这就有了给准备升学的人补课的时间。
    加强劳动教育和生产技术教育
    以上是就大量不能升学的青年的出路说的。下边还有必要谈谈今后，因为这并非今年一年的问题，明年、后年还会有。为了使将来的中、小学毕业生不能升学而去就业的时候有适于就业的知识、能力和正确的认识，就应当加强中、小学的劳动教育、基本生产技术教育和政治思想教育，有了这几方面的基础，他们去就业就要比今天有更好的条件，也就可以把受某种训练的时间缩短，并且有的工作可以不需要训练。加强这几方面的教育，并非单纯为了就业，对于升学也是大有好处的。至于高中，似乎可以认真地讨论一番，有无文、理分科之必要，如能文、理分科，不论升学、就业，都可能比今天的基础好。马克思反对过早的分化是对的，但初中毕业后再分化，还算不算过早呢？我们多种不同性质的中等技术学校不就是高中程度的分化吗？
    总起来说，国家没有保证任何人都能升学的义务，并且在任何国家也都没有这样做过，但是对于大量不能升学的十几岁的男女青年却有必要给他们想就业的办法；尽管在今天还没有条件使他们都能就业，也还是希望尽可能的多想办法。
    我这些意见可能是些不切实际的空谈，希望大家多多指教！
