Xinhua News Agency, March 10th: The early spring Summer Palace welcomed distinguished guests from the Czechoslovak Republic this morning.

Prime Minister Viliam Široký and his wife, accompanied by Vice Premier He Long and his wife, visited the palace. Members of the Czechoslovak government delegation and accompanying staff also joined the tour.

The ice and mud in the Summer Palace were just beginning to thaw. Tourists cheered the distinguished guests. Prime Minister Široký visited the Hall of Benevolence and Longevity (Renshou Dian) and strolled into the Garden of Virtue and Harmony (Dehe Yuan). He praised the Chinese classical pavilions, terraces, and scenery in the garden, saying, "I feel like I have come to a fairyland!"

The statues in the Sea of Wisdom (Zhihui Hai) reminded Prime Minister Široký of a humorous Western myth.

After telling the myth, he made everyone around him laugh. After seeing the Marble Boat, the hosts invited the guests to lunch at the Listening to Orioles Hall (Ting Li Guan).

After lunch, the guests toured the Long Corridor and took photos in front of the magnificent Cloud-Dispelling Hall (Pai Yun Dian) as a memento.

Xinhua News Agency, March 10th: The All-China Women's Federation (ACWF) held a tea party this afternoon to welcome the wife of Czechoslovak Prime Minister Široký. Mrs. A. Gregor, the wife of the Czechoslovak Ambassador to China, and the wives of diplomatic officials from the Czechoslovak Embassy in China were also invited to attend the tea party.

Zhang Yun, Vice President of the ACWF, extended a warm welcome to the guests. She asked Mrs. Široký to convey the respect of Chinese women to all sisters in Czechoslovakia.

In her reply, Mrs. Široký conveyed the respect of Mrs. Zápotocký, the wife of the Czechoslovak President, and Czechoslovak women to Chinese women.

Also present at the tea party were Deng Yuzhi, General Secretary of the National Association of the Young Women's Christian Association of China, Liu Wang Liming, President of the National Association of Women's Christian Temperance Union of China, Liu Qingyang, Chairman of the Beijing Women's Federation, and the wife of Cao Ying, the Chinese Ambassador to Czechoslovakia.
