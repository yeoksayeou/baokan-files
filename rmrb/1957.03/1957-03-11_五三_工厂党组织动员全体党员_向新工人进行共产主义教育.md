The Party organization of the "May 3rd" Factory mobilized all Party members to focus on conducting communist education for new workers.

    (Our report) According to the "Shenyang Daily," the Party organization of the "May 3rd" Factory has mobilized all Party members to concentrate efforts on conducting communist education for new workers.

    This factory recruited a large number of new workers last year based on production needs. These new workers came from various social strata and had not received systematic communist education. Therefore, with their entry into the factory, they also brought various non-working-class ideologies. Although most of them can actively study politics and technology, constantly overcome various erroneous ideas, master production skills, and strive to complete production tasks, there is also a small number of new workers who have not overcome the non-working-class consciousness they had previously acquired. They are undisciplined and lax in their work, disobey leadership commands, are often absent from work, disrespect veteran workers, are unwilling to participate in physical labor, and some individual workers are even morally corrupt and degenerate. The Party committee noticed this phenomenon and held a plenary meeting to discuss the issue. The Party committee believes that helping these workers who frequently violate labor discipline, especially those from exploiting-class families, to establish a working-class ideology is a process of complete transformation. To this end, the Party committee decided to concentrate efforts on conducting communist education for all new workers for a period of time.

    Currently, under the leadership of the factory's Party committee, the forces of the trade union, the Communist Youth League, and other aspects have been organized, and the ideological trends of employees have been initially grasped. On February 28, the Party committee convened a cadre meeting, requiring all Party members to conduct communist education for new workers and to make this work the central task of the entire factory's education work. In terms of working methods, a combination of positive education and criticism and self-criticism will be adopted. The Party committee requires all Party members and leaders at all levels to enhance their understanding, clearly recognize the new problems currently emerging among new workers, and understand the important significance of strengthening ideological education for new workers. All Party members and members of the Communist Youth League should take helping new workers as their important responsibility; Party and Communist Youth League branch meetings should be held in workshops with many new workers to discuss this issue. The Party committee also decided to set aside a month of spare time to teach new workers courses on the working class and the Chinese Communist Party. In addition to preparing to use outstanding figures among the new workers to conduct positive education for everyone, the factory also plans to organize discussions and criticisms of erroneous ideas among the new workers. The factory Party committee also instructed leaders at all levels to further care for the lives of new workers while conducting ideological education, and to pay attention to solving practical problems that can be solved.

### “五三”工厂党组织动员全体党员  向新工人进行共产主义教育

    “五三”工厂党组织动员全体党员
    向新工人进行共产主义教育
    本报讯　据沈阳日报消息：“五三”工厂党组织动员全体党员，集中力量向新工人进行共产主义教育。
    这个工厂在去年根据生产需要曾招收了大量的新工人。这些新工人出身于各个阶层，没有受过系统的共产主义的教育，因此随着他们的入厂，也就把各种非工人阶级思想带到了工厂来。虽然他们当中的大多数都能够积极学习政治和技术，不断克服各种错误思想，掌握生产本领，努力完成生产任务；但是，也有一小部分新工人没有克服过去所沾染的非工人阶级意识，他们在工作中自由散漫，不服从领导指挥，任意旷工，不尊重老师傅，不愿参加体力劳动，甚至还有个别工人道德败坏，腐化堕落。党委会注意了这种现象，曾召开全体会议讨论了这一问题。党委认为：帮助这些经常违犯劳动纪律的工人，特别是那些出身于剥削阶级家庭的子弟树立工人阶级思想，乃是一个脱胎换骨的过程。为此，党委决定在一个时期内，集中力量向全体新工人进行共产主义教育。
    目前，在该厂党委领导下，已组织了工会、青年团等各方面的力量，初步掌握了职工思想动向。2月28日，党委召开了干部会议，要求全体党员向新工人进行共产主义教育，并把这项工作列为全厂整个教育工作的中心任务。在工作方法上，采取正面教育与开展批评与自我批评相结合的方法。党委要求全体党员和各级领导提高认识，明确认识目前新工人中出现的新问题，懂得对新工人加强思想教育的重要意义。全体党员、团员要把帮助新工人做为自己的重要责任；在新工人多的车间要召开党、团员支部大会讨论这一问题。党委还决定抽出一个月的业余时间，向新工人讲授有关工人阶级和中国共产党的课程。该厂除准备通过新工人中的优秀人物向大家进行正面的教育以外，还准备有组织地，讨论和批评新工人中的错误思想。该厂党委还指示各级领导人员，在向新工人进行思想教育的同时，要进一步关心新工人的生活，注意解决那些能够解决的实际问题。
