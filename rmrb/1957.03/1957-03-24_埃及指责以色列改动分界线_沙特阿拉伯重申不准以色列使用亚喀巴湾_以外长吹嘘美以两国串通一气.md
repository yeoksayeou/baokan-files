Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd dispatch from Gaza City: The Egyptian representative to the United Nations Mixed Armistice Commission, Osman, today accused Israel of moving the boundary line between Israel and Egypt several hundred yards into Egyptian territory during its occupation of the Gaza Strip.

Osman said: The Egyptian authorities will request the United Nations to appoint an international investigation team to determine the exact location of the boundary line stipulated in the 1949 Armistice Agreement. He said that Egypt will demand the restoration of the original boundary line as it existed at the time of the 1949 armistice.

Meanwhile, on the morning of the 22nd, another Israeli jet plane flew over the northern part of the Gaza Strip. The Egyptian delegation to the Mixed Armistice Commission had already protested on the 22nd against the intrusion of Israeli aircraft into Gaza. A spokesman for the delegation said that this was the fifth protest lodged by the Egyptian delegation in a week against Israeli aircraft intrusions.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 23rd: Saudi Arabian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Faisal told reporters from the Middle East News Agency last night that Saudi Arabia's policy had not changed in any way as a result of the Saudi King's recent visit to the United States, and that his country's views were consistent with those of Egypt on all important issues.

He reiterated that his country and Egypt have the right to prohibit Israeli ships from using the Gulf of Aqaba. He said: The Saudi Arabian government will take all necessary measures to defend its historical rights in the Gulf of Aqaba and to ensure the security of its territory and territorial waters.

Xinhua News Agency, March 23rd dispatch from Tel Aviv: Israeli Foreign Minister Golda Meir said on the 22nd that the United States had not violated its promises regarding the Gaza Strip and the Gulf of Aqaba, and that the United States had even expressed a desire to implement its policies together with Israel.

Meir said that the United States now holds "the same attitude" towards the Middle East issue as it did before Israel's withdrawal. There is no difference between the Israeli government and the US government in interpreting the guarantees that led Israel to withdraw its troops.

The Israeli government has consistently said that it withdrew its troops on the premise that the United States made certain "guarantees." According to them, this is to prevent the Egyptians from returning to Gaza and to internationalize the Gulf of Aqaba.

    埃及指责以色列改动分界线

    以外长吹嘘美以两国串通一气
    据新华社23日讯　加沙城消息：出席联合国混合停战委员会的埃及代表奥斯曼今天指责以色列在占领加沙地带期间把以色列和埃及的分界线向埃及这一边移动了几百码。
    奥斯曼说：埃及当局将要求联合国任命一个国际调查组来确定1949年停战协定所规定的分界线的确切地点。他说，埃及将要求恢复1949年停战时的原来的界线。
    同时，22日早晨又有一架以色列喷气式飞机飞越加沙地带北部。混合停战委员会埃及代表团已经在22日就以色列飞机侵入加沙提出抗议。代表团发言人说，这是埃及代表团在一星期内第五次抗议以色列飞机入侵。
    据新华社开罗23日电　沙特阿拉伯首相兼外交大臣费萨尔昨晚对中东通讯社记者发表谈话说：沙特阿拉伯的政策并没有因为沙特国王最近访问了美国而有任何改变，在一切重要问题上，他的国家和埃及的意见是一致的。
    他再一次重申他的国家和埃及有权禁止以色列船只使用亚喀巴湾。他说：沙特阿拉伯政府将采取一切必要的措施来保卫它在亚喀巴湾的历史权利和保证自己领土和领水的安全。
    据新华社23日讯　特拉维夫消息：以色列外交部长梅厄夫人22日说：美国并没有违背它在加沙地带和亚喀巴湾问题上的诺言，美国甚至表示要求同以色列一起执行它的政策。
    梅厄说，美国现在对中东问题抱着同以色列撤军前“一样的态度”。在对于使以色列撤军的保证的解释方面，以色列政府同美国政府没有分歧。
    以色列政府一直说，它是在美国作了某些“保证”的前提下撤军的。据他们说，这就是不让埃及人回到加沙以及亚喀巴湾的国际化。
