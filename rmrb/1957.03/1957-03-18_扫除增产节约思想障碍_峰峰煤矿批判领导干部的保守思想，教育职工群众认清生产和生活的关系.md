Xinhua News Agency report: The Fengfeng Mining Bureau Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has adopted effective measures to vigorously eliminate the ideological obstacles to carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy. The political and ideological education work of the Fengfeng Mining Bureau is carried out from two aspects: criticizing the current right-leaning conservative thinking of leading cadres; and educating the workers and masses to understand the correct relationship between production and life.

The leading cadres of various mines in the Fengfeng Coal Mine, due to the widespread existence of relatively serious right-leaning conservative thinking, have hindered the further development of the movement to increase production and practice economy. The manifestations of these conservative ideas are diverse. Some people believe that "there is not much potential left, there is nothing to be done"; others lack in-depth understanding, have no idea, and are not clear about the potential of their units, and dare not accept the tasks given by higher authorities. More common is the idea of ​​"waiting and seeing," feeling that the annual plan has not yet been finalized. Another is the existence of a "holding back" mentality, knowing that the potential of the enterprise is great, but not mobilizing the masses, not daring to calculate, fearing that the leadership will determine the annual task based on the calculated figures, and fearing that they will "suffer losses" and be "passive" in the future. Among the workers and mining area cadres, there is also the fear that if the plan is too high, it will be "difficult to over-produce and the rewards will not be guaranteed."

The Fengfeng Mining Bureau Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, after studying and analyzing the above situation, believes that solving the right-leaning conservative thinking of the current cadres, especially leading cadres at all levels, is the key to further carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy. Therefore, it held two consecutive meetings of factory and mine responsible cadres, criticized and analyzed conservative thinking, and based on the current huge production potential and loopholes in the work, calculated several accounts on national resources, labor organization, and pit prop consumption. The calculations showed that if the masses were fully mobilized and painstaking and meticulous work were done, the country could save more than six million yuan throughout the year, using these specific examples to educate the cadres. The results of this work have already been effective. According to the preliminary investigation and calculation results of the Fourth Mine under the Bureau, it can save the country 480,000 yuan throughout the year without adding any equipment.

A problem that has not been resolved for a long time in the movement to increase production and practice economy in the five coal mines under the Fengfeng Mining Bureau is the incorrect ideological sentiments that are currently growing among the workers and masses, such as demanding better treatment, demanding enjoyment, unwillingness to endure hardship, reaching out to the state for money, and creating trouble if they are not resolved. This kind of thinking seriously affects the further development of the movement to increase production and practice economy. In response to these ideological sentiments, the party organizations of the Fengfeng Coal Mine successively mobilized all employees in early March to discuss the relationship between increasing production, practicing economy, and improving the lives of workers.

After discussion, many workers understood the reason why they must work hard, and many complaints and problems were easily solved. For example, some people were dissatisfied with the wage reform because they were not promoted, but they were satisfied after the discussion. Jia Zhichao of the First Mine said: "I always thought that the higher the treatment, the better, and the lighter the work, the better. This is very wrong." Song Qinglin, a technician from the Fifth Mine, said: "The dissatisfaction with wages is mainly because we didn't compare it with the hard life in the past." In the discussion, many people who made trouble due to dissatisfaction with wages examined their mistakes and expressed their willingness to actively produce. On the housing issue, everyone also realized that the state has built a lot of houses, mainly because everyone's living standards have improved, and family members come to visit one after another, which is not enough. It's okay if family members come a little later. Wang San, who lives in an adobe house in the First Mine, said: "I originally wanted to ask to change it, but now compare it with my adobe house at home, it's better than the adobe house at home, so don't change it."

In the discussion, many old workers recalled their poor lives in the past and were very satisfied with the current workers' living standards and welfare undertakings. Gao Shengtang and Zhang Quanxi, workers from the Fifth Mine, said: In the past, we lived in broken kilns, and no one cared when we got sick. Now we live in new houses, and the state provides treatment when we get sick, and the cadres often come to see us; in the past, we couldn't even afford a quilt, but now we can bring our families; in the past, no one cared about us when we came out of the mine like black people, but now we can take a shower whenever we want, twice a day. We must do a good job.

After the discussion, and after the employees' thoughts were cleared, the employees' enthusiasm for work generally increased, and the production situation in each mine has undergone great changes. Taking the First Mine, which had failed to complete its production tasks since January of this year, as an example, according to statistics from March 1st to 5th, the output completed 126.55% of the plan; the tunneling efficiency completed 117% of the plan; the overall efficiency completed 132.35%; the recovery attendance rate increased by 8.9% compared with the same period in February. The consumption of pit props was reduced by seventy-seven point three five cubic meters. The safety situation has also improved. Now, each mine is further mobilizing the workers and masses to tap potential and do a good job in the movement to increase production and practice economy.

    扫除增产节约思想障碍
    峰峰煤矿批判领导干部的保守思想，教育职工群众认清生产和生活的关系
    据新华社讯　中共峰峰矿务局委员会采取有效措施，大力扫除开展增产节约运动的思想障碍。峰峰矿务局的政治思想教育工作，从两方面进行：批判当前领导干部中的右倾保守思想；教育职工群众认清生产和生活的正确关系。
    峰峰煤矿各矿领导干部，由于普遍存在较为严重的右倾保守思想，妨碍了增产节约运动的进一步开展。这些保守思想的表现是多种多样的。有的人认为“油水不大了，没有什么搞头了”；有的人缺乏深入，心中无数，对本单位的潜力不摸底，对上级给的任务不敢接受。较为普遍的是觉得年度计划还没有最后确定下来，存有“等一等”的思想。另一种则是存在“留一手”思想，明明知道本企业的潜力很大，但是不去发动群众，不敢算账，怕领导方面按算账的数字给确定全年任务，怕自己“吃了亏”，将来“被动”。在工人群众和采区干部中则存在着怕计划高了“不好超产，奖励没保证”。
    中共峰峰矿务局委员会，对以上情况作了研究分析，认为解决当前干部尤其是各级领导干部中的右倾保守思想，是进一步开展增产节约运动的关键。于是连续召开了两次厂矿负责干部会议，对保守思想作了批判、分析，并且根据当前生产的巨大潜力和工作中的漏洞，就国家资源、劳动组织、坑木的消耗算了几笔账。经过算账表明，如果充分发动群众，作艰苦细致工作，全年就可能为国家节约资金六百多万元，用这些具体事例对干部进行了教育。这样作的结果目前已经收到效果。据这个局所属第四矿初步摸底算账的结果，全年在不增加任何设备的情况下，可以为国家节约四十八万元。
    峰峰矿务局所属五个煤矿，在开展增产节约运动中长时间没有解决的问题，就是目前在职工群众中普遍滋长着闹待遇、闹享受、不愿吃苦、伸手向国家要钱，不解决就闹情绪不生产等不正确的思想情绪。这种思想情绪严重地影响着增产节约运动的进一步开展。针对这些思想情绪，峰峰煤矿党的组织3月上旬先后发动全体职工，对增产节约和改善职工生活的关系问题展开讨论。
    经过讨论，许多职工弄清了为什么必须艰苦努力的道理，许多不满意见和问题都迎刃而解了。例如一些人没有升级对工资改革不满的问题，讨论以后都满意了。一矿的贾志超说：“我老想着，待遇越高越好，工作越轻越好，这是非常错误的。”五矿技术员宋清林说：“对工资不满，主要是没和过去的艰苦生活对比。”在讨论中许多因对工资不满而闹情绪的人检讨了自己的错误，都表示要积极生产。在住房问题上，大家也认识到：国家盖的房已经不算少了，主要是大家生活提高了，家属纷纷来，不够住，家属慢点来就行了。一矿住土房的王三说：“我原想要求换一换，现在和我家的土房比比，比家里的土房还好，不要换了。”
    在讨论中许多老工人都回忆了过去的穷苦生活，对现在的工人生活待遇、福利事业十分满意。五矿工人高升堂、张全喜都说：过去住破窑，病了没人管，现在住新房，病了国家给治疗，干部还常来看；过去连个被子也带不起，现在能带家属了；过去下井出来像个黑人谁管咱，现在随便洗澡，一天洗两回。这得好好干。
    经过讨论，打通了职工思想以后，职工劳动热情普遍提高，各矿生产局面已经有了很大变化。以今年1月以来完不成生产任务的一矿为例，据3月1日到5日的统计，产量完成计划的126.55％；掘进效率完成计划的117％；全员效率完成132.35％；回采出勤率比2月份同期提高8.9％。坑木消耗量降低七十七点三五立方公尺。安全情况也有好转。现在，各矿正进一步发动职工群众挖掘潜力搞好增产节约运动。
