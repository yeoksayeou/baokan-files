    据新华社柏林11日电　斯德哥尔摩消息：中国男子乒乓球队3月10日在第二十四届世界男子乒乓球团体赛复赛中，以一比五输给上届世界冠军日本队。日本取得决赛权。中国选手王传耀在比赛中击败了上届世界单打冠军荻村伊智朗。
    这一场比赛，中国队以姜永宁、王传耀、傅其芳上场。日本队以上届世界冠军荻村伊智朗、上届单打亚军田中利明以及角田启辅上场。
    第一盘姜永宁对荻村。荻村以二十一比十一，二十一比十三连胜两局。第二盘王传耀对角田。王传耀以二十一比七胜第一局。角田以二十一比十五赢得了第二局。第三局中，王传耀以旋转得十分厉害的发球屡屡得分，角田摸索了好久才找到了回击的方法，结果角田以二十一比十七又胜一局。第三盘由傅其芳对田中。这两人都以善于正手抽杀著称，结果田中以二十一比十四和二十一比十二取胜。
    第四盘，王传耀对世界单打冠军荻村。王传耀在第一局中以生龙活虎的攻击把荻村打成十九比十三，领先六分，这时候日本队长南俊一在旁边打气，大叫“赶上去”，“赶上去”，但是荻村仍被王传耀连得两分而取得胜利。第一局失败后，荻村同教练程塚商量了一会，并且脱去了外衣回到桌子边上，企图扭转局势。比赛开始，荻村好几次错误判断了王传耀的杀球路线，结果又以十三比二十一输给了王传耀。
    第五盘姜永宁第二次上场，对手是田中。田中的速度比姜永宁快，连胜两局。这两人在比赛中都好几次在离桌很远的地方救球，有一次姜永宁冲到了离桌子十五英尺的地方救了一个险球。
    第六盘第一局傅其芳以二十一比十九胜角田。后来角田以二十一比十五扳回一局。第三局，傅其芳曾经以十八比十七领先，但是角田以凶猛的杀球转入优势，以二十二比二十胜第三局。
    比赛后，被王传耀打败的世界冠军荻村说，中国选手的发球太凶了。他说，我花了好多时间才摸到如何接这些球的办法。王传耀有惊人的速度。他一旦有更多的经验，将能成为一个世界无敌的乒乓球选手。其他中国选手也同样是这样，他们进步得非常快。
    据新华社柏林11日电　斯德哥尔摩消息：匈牙利男子乒乓球队3月10日在世界男子乒乓球团体赛复赛中，以五比○战胜捷克斯洛伐克队。匈牙利队将同日本队争夺这一届的世界冠军。
