    Oppose Imperialist Interference in Indonesia's Internal Affairs
    Recently, the political situation in Indonesia has appeared particularly turbulent, and this turbulence is inseparable from imperialist interference in Indonesia's internal affairs. Indonesian public opinion, in commenting on the recent domestic situation, has repeatedly pointed out that imperialism is colluding with domestic reactionary forces, plotting military coups, creating regional divisions, attempting to subvert the current Indonesian government, and stifle the independence of this young republic. As everyone knows, the four military coups staged by Lubis in Jakarta last year and the local military coups in central and northern Sumatra were directly and openly supported by imperialism. Now, imperialist interference and subversion activities are even more rampant, and they are plotting new conspiracies.
    The U.S. Embassy in Jakarta has consistently participated in subversive conspiracies in the past, and recently there have been new activities. Jakarta Garrison Commander Major Dahler, at a press conference on February 7, condemned certain foreign embassies for providing funds to purchase weapons in a plot to overthrow the current Indonesian government. According to a February 16 report in "Indonesian News," the foreign embassy funding the subversive activities is the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta. Indonesian newspapers also revealed that on February 13, U.S. Embassy in Jakarta Air Force Attaché Lieutenant Colonel Smith, along with three U.S. military personnel, flew a seaplane to the waters off Edam Island, 25 miles north of Jakarta, without the permission of the Indonesian Air Force authorities. This island is a base for arms smuggling. Smith's visit there obviously had ulterior motives. More noteworthy is the role played by the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) in this subversive activity. Long ago, Indonesian military authorities discovered that foreign aircraft and submarines of unknown nationality were secretly intruding into Indonesia, supplying weapons to the Indonesian rebel group "Darul Islam." According to a recent report in the Indonesian "Eastern Star Daily," Indonesian authorities have collected documents and photographs proving that some foreign aircraft frequently flying over Indonesian territory and submarines of unknown nationality appearing in the Indian Ocean waters near Indonesian territory are using the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean as bases. And SEATO's base in the southwestern Pacific has been moved to these two islands. This not only proves that this military bloc is directly planning this subversive activity but also once again exposes the aggressiveness of this bloc.
    President Sukarno's reform plan, announced on February 21, aroused even further hatred from the imperialists, who have consistently conspired to divide and subvert the Republic of Indonesia. U.S., British, and other imperialist news agencies and newspapers, in addition to slandering Sukarno's plan as "obviously clumsy system," "an imitation of something worse," etc., when reporting on the situation after the announcement of Sukarno's plan, further claimed that Jakarta was "filled with an atmosphere of tension and chaos, and Western diplomats and expatriates felt that their personal safety was not guaranteed," etc. They maliciously portrayed the mass movement in support of Sukarno's plan as "communist terrorist activities," even fabricating rumors and slandering that "the movement of the Communist Party and leftists to force people to accept Sukarno's plan has reached the point where violence is about to occur." As Indonesian newspapers and some public leaders have pointed out, such distorted reports by imperialist news agencies "harbor the purpose of subversion." According to a United Press International report, after the announcement of Sukarno's plan, Washington's diplomatic authorities are watching the development of the Indonesian situation with great interest and "fear." U.S. military authorities also "bluntly" stated: "If the Communist Party controls Indonesia," it "will create a large gap in the anti-communist defense between Australia and Singapore." Dulles also said at a press conference in Washington on March 5: Because "Indonesia is located between Indochina, which is included in the Manila Treaty, and certain countries in other treaty areas, such as Australia and New Zealand, what happens there will naturally make member countries feel interested and concerned." According to Western news agencies, the meeting of foreign ministers of the eight member countries of SEATO, scheduled to be held in Canberra from March 11 to 13, is expected to "discuss the developments in Indonesia quite thoroughly." The above-mentioned remarks and activities of the imperialists all foreshadow that they are brewing new conspiracies to implement further interference in Indonesia.
    The intensification of imperialist interference in Indonesia, which seriously threatens Indonesia's independence and security, has aroused great indignation among the Indonesian people of all strata. On January 27, a mass rally against subversion activities was held in Bandung with the participation of 100,000 people. The rally passed a resolution calling on the Indonesian people to unite and shatter the imperialist conspiracy of interference. President Sukarno said at the rally: The imperialists cannot be allowed to continue to carry out activities in Indonesia, and the Indonesian people must resist their political and economic subversive activities. The spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs also issued a statement opposing SEATO's discussion of Indonesia's internal affairs. Indonesian newspapers have published comments condemning imperialist interference in Indonesia's internal affairs. We believe that the patriotic Indonesian people, as long as they unite closely, have the power to safeguard their national independence and national unity and defeat the new conspiracies of imperialism.

### 反对帝国主义干涉印度尼西亚内政

    反对帝国主义干涉印度尼西亚内政
    最近一个时期，印度尼西亚的政治局势显得特别动荡不安，而这种动荡不安是同帝国主义对印度尼西亚内政的干涉分不开的。印度尼西亚的舆论在评论最近的国内局势时一再指出，帝国主义正勾结国内的反动势力，策划军事政变、制造地方割据、力图颠复印度尼西亚的现政府，扼杀这个年轻共和国的独立。尽人皆知，去年在雅加达发生的卢比斯四次军事政变和在苏门答腊中部和北部发生的地方性军事政变，都受到帝国主义直接和公开的支持。现在帝国主义的干涉和颠复活动更加猖獗，他们正在策划新的阴谋。
    美国驻雅加达大使馆过去一贯参与颠复的阴谋，近来又有新的活动。雅加达卫戍司令达赫尔少校在2月7日的记者招待会上，斥责某些外国大使馆正在提供购买武器的基金，阴谋推翻印度尼西亚现政府。据2月16日的“印度尼西亚新闻”揭露，这个资助颠复活动的外国大使馆就是美国驻雅加达大使馆。印度尼西亚报纸还揭露，2月13日美国驻雅加达大使馆空军武官史密斯中校带领三个美国军人，未经印度尼西亚空军当局的允许，即乘一架水陆两用飞机飞到雅加达以北二十五英里的厄达姆岛的海面上。这个岛是军火走私的基地。史密斯到那里去，显然怀有不可告人的目的。更值得注意的是东南亚条约组织在这一颠复活动中所起的作用。很久以前，印度尼西亚军事当局就发现有不明国籍的外国飞机和潜水艇秘密侵入印度尼西亚，供给印度尼西亚的叛军“伊斯兰教军”武器。近据印度尼西亚“东星报”报道，印度尼西亚负责当局已经搜集到一些文件和照片，证明常常在印度尼西亚领土上空来往飞行的一些外国飞机和在印度尼西亚领土附近印度洋海面出没的不明国籍的潜水艇，是以印度洋中的可可岛和圣诞岛作为基地的。而东南亚条约组织在西南太平洋的基地已经搬到这两个岛上。这不但证明这个军事集团是直接策划这种颠覆活动的，而且再一次暴露了这个集团的侵略性。
    苏加诺总统2月21日公布的改革方案，引起了一贯阴谋分裂和颠复印度尼西亚共和国的帝国主义的更进一步的仇恨。美、英等帝国主义通讯社和报纸，除了诽谤苏加诺方案是“显然笨拙的制度”，“是对更坏的东西的模仿”等等而外，在报道苏加诺方案公布后的情况时，更说什么雅加达“充满了紧张混乱的气氛，西方外交官和侨民感到自身安全缺乏保障”等等。他们恶意地将群众拥护苏加诺方案的运动，说成是“共产主义分子的恐怖活动”，甚至造谣诬蔑说，“共产党和左翼分子强迫人们接受苏加诺的方案的运动，已经达到快要发生暴力的程度了”。正如印度尼西亚报纸和一些公众领袖所指出的，帝国主义通讯社这种歪曲事实的报道，“包藏着颠复活动的目的”。据合众社消息，苏加诺方案公布之后，华盛顿的外交当局正怀着很大的兴趣和“害怕”的心情注视着印度尼西亚局势的发展。美国的军事当局还“直率地”说：“如果共产党控制了印度尼西亚的话”，“将会在澳大利亚和新加坡之间的反共防御中，造成一个很大缺口”。杜勒斯在3月5日在华盛顿举行的记者招待会上也说：因为“印度尼西亚位于包括在马尼拉条约中的印度支那和其他条约地区的某些国家，如澳大利亚和新西兰之间，那里发生的事情自然会使成员国家感到兴趣和关切”。据西方通讯社报道，即将于3月11日至13日在堪培拉举行的东南亚条约八个成员国的外长会议，预定要“相当彻底地讨论印度尼西亚的事态发展”。帝国主义的上述言论和活动，都预示着他们正在酝酿对印度尼西亚实行进一步干涉的新阴谋。
    帝国主义加紧对印度尼西亚的干涉，严重地威胁着印度尼西亚的独立和安全，已引起印度尼西亚各阶层人民的极大愤慨。1月27日在万隆举行了有十万人参加的反颠复活动大会，大会通过了一项决议，号召印度尼西亚人民团结一致，粉碎帝国主义的干涉阴谋。苏加诺总统在大会上说：不能听任帝国主义分子继续在印度尼西亚进行活动，印度尼西亚人民必须抵抗他们在政治上和经济上的颠复活动。印度尼西亚外交部发言人也发表谈话，反对东南亚条约组织讨论印度尼西亚的内政。印度尼西亚报纸纷纷发表评论谴责帝国主义对印度尼西亚内政的干涉。我们相信：爱国的印度尼西亚人民，只要紧紧地团结起来，是有力量维护自己民族的独立和国家的统一，而打败帝国主义的新阴谋的。
