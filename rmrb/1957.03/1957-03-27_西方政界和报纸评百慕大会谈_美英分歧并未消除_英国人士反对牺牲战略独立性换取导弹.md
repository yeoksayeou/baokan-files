Xinhua News Agency report: Western political circles and newspapers have been commenting on the results of the Bermuda summit between British and American leaders. Some newspapers, such as the "New York Times," said that the talks eliminated "discord" between the two countries and "laid a solid foundation" for bilateral relations. At the same time, many newspapers pointed out that the talks failed to achieve a common policy between the two countries on issues such as the Middle East.

	The "Times" believes that the Anglo-American talks, to a certain extent, coordinated the policies between the two countries. However, it believes that the joint communique on the Middle East issue is still not clear enough. Because the communique did not clearly state what should be done if Egypt ignores the Western countries' proposals put forward by Hammarskjöld regarding the Gaza Strip, the Gulf of Aqaba, and the Suez Canal.

	At the same time, some French newspapers also believe that this meeting deepened the unequal relationship between the two countries. "Le Monde's" correspondent reported from Bermuda on the 25th: "The meeting prominently illustrates the fact that Britain is not negotiating with the United States on an equal footing, and its dependence on the United States has even increased."

	Reuters reporters believe that the United States' decision to participate in the Baghdad Pact Military Committee is actually part of the United States' plan, which is to use American power to fill the void left by the weakening of British power, in order to strengthen the "defense of the free world."

	The "News Chronicle," in discussing the United States' intention to give missiles to Britain, pointed out: The United States is using the provision of something to Britain to obtain the right to manage and use rocket bases in Britain.

	London's "Daily Mirror" published an article by Labour MP Richard Crossman on the 25th, saying that Macmillan had signed away Britain's strategic independence in Bermuda. He said: According to the Bermuda agreement, "For the first time, we have agreed to the direct control of our defense system by the United States."

	A commentator for the "Daily Express" wrote: These conditions basically amount to leaving "these missiles still in the hands of the U.S. armed forces" and "they cannot be used without the consent of the U.S. armed forces," even though these missiles will be stored in Britain. The "Daily Express" said: "Some British defense leaders believe that the conditions attached to this agreement are paralyzing conditions." Because of these conditions, Britain "will be in a situation where its existence will be determined by the United States." American sources also said that Britain can only obtain medium-range ballistic missiles that can carry atomic warheads, not the warheads themselves.

	An Agence France-Presse reporter said that the communique did not mention many issues on which no agreement had been reached. Among these issues, the most prominent is the Far East issue, because Britain's request to relax the "embargo" against China was once again opposed. The communique made no mention of the issue of possible U.S. economic aid to Britain. While Macmillan and Eisenhower did discuss this issue in separate talks, there was nothing definite. The communique also made no mention of the British plan to reduce its troops stationed in West Germany, indicating that no agreement has yet been reached on this matter.

### 西方政界和报纸评百慕大会谈  美英分歧并未消除  英国人士反对牺牲战略独立性换取导弹

    西方政界和报纸评百慕大会谈
    美英分歧并未消除
    英国人士反对牺牲战略独立性换取导弹
    据新华社讯　西方政界和报纸纷纷评论百慕大英美首脑会谈的结果。“纽约时报”等一些报纸说，会谈消除了两国间的“不和”，为两国关系“奠定了坚实的基础”。同时，也有不少报纸指出会谈并没有能使两国在中东等方面有共同的政策。
      “泰晤士报”认为英美会谈在一定程度上协调了两国间的政策。但是，它认为，会谈公报关于中东问题还是说得不够清楚。因为公报没有说明白如果埃及不理会哈马舍尔德所提出的西方国家关于加沙地区、亚喀巴湾和苏伊士运河的建议的话应该怎么办。
    同时，法国一些报纸也认为，这次会谈加深了两国不平等的关系。“世界报”记者25日从百慕大发出的电讯说：“会谈突出地说明了一个事实，那就是英国并不是在平等的基础上同美国进行会谈，它依靠美国的程度甚至增加了。”
    路透社记者认为，美国参加巴格达条约军事委员会的决定实际上是美国的计划的一部分，美国的计划就是要以美国的力量来填补英国力量削弱的地方，以加强“自由世界的防御”。
    “新闻纪事报”在谈到美国打算给英国导弹的问题的时候指出：美国利用给英国一点什么而在英国取得管理和使用火箭基地的权利。
    伦敦“每日镜报”25日刊载了工党议员理查德·克罗斯曼写的一篇文章说，麦克米伦在百慕大签字出让了英国的战略独立性。他说：根据百慕大协定，“我们第一次同意美国对我们的防御体系进行直接的控制。”
      “每日快报”的评论员写道：这些条件基本上等于使“这些导弹仍然为美国武装部队所掌握，而且“不得到美国武装部队的同意就不能使用它们”，尽管这些导弹将存放在英国。“每日快报”说：“英国一些国防领导人认为，这个协定所附带的条件是使人瘫痪的条件。”由于这些条件，英国“将处于这样一种境地：它的存在将由美国决定。”美国人士也说，英国只能获得能够装载原子弹头的中程弹道导弹，而不是弹头本身。
    法新社记者说，在会议公报里没有谈到许多没有达成协议的问题，在这些问题中，突出的是远东问题，这是因为英国要求放宽对中国“禁运”再度遭到了反对。公报对美国可能给予英国经济援助问题只字未提。而麦克米伦和艾森豪威尔在单独会谈时的确讨论了这个问题，但是，没有任何肯定的东西。公报也只字未提英国裁减驻西德军队计划，这表明在这件事情上还没有达成协议。
