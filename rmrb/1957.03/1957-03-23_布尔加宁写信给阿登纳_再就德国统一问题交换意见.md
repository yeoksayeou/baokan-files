Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 21st - Bonn dispatch: The Soviet Ambassador to West Germany, Smirnov, paid a visit to West German Chancellor Adenauer on the 20th and handed him a letter from the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, to Adenauer.

Smirnov and Adenauer held talks for forty minutes.

On the same day, he said: This letter from the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, to West German Chancellor Adenauer is a continuation of the exchange of views between the two sides on the issue of German reunification.

Speaking at a luncheon meeting of the Foreign Press Association in Bonn, Smirnov said: The exchange of letters should be seen as a new step in the Soviet side's efforts to overcome difficulties in relations between the two countries, and a new step in developing friendship between the Soviet Union and West Germany. He pointed out that the current relations between the two countries are still far from the kind of relations that the Soviet Union hopes to establish. He said that eliminating the current difficulties requires time and patience.

When talking about trade relations between the two countries, Smirnov pointed out that in a period before World War II, the amount of Soviet-German trade once reached 3 billion marks for each side. Smirnov believes that the total turnover of trade between the two countries should be developed to the pre-war level of 6 billion marks, while the current level is less than 1 billion marks.

Smirnov also talked about the decision of the United Kingdom to withdraw 13,500 occupation troops from West Germany. He said that the number of withdrawals is not enough. The Soviet government has suggested withdrawing one-third of the occupation troops from Germany.

　　布尔加宁写信给阿登纳
　　再就德国统一问题交换意见
    据新华社柏林21日电　波恩消息：苏联驻西德大使斯米尔诺夫20日拜会了西德总理阿登纳，同时把苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁写给阿登纳的信交给他。
    斯米尔诺夫同阿登纳会谈了四十分钟。
    同一天，他说：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁这次给西德总理阿登纳的信，是双方就德国统一问题所进行的意见交换的继续。
    斯米尔诺夫在波恩外国记者协会的午餐会上说：应该把信件的来往看作是苏联方面为了克服两国关系中的困难而作的努力的新步骤，是发展苏联和西德的友谊的新步骤。他指出：两国目前的关系还同苏联所希望建立的那种关系相距甚远。他说：消除目前的困难是需要时间和耐心的。
    斯米尔诺夫在谈到两国贸易关系的时候指出：在第二次世界大战以前的一个时期里，苏德贸易数额曾经达到双方各三十亿马克。斯米尔诺夫认为，两国贸易总周转额应该发展到战前六十亿马克的水平，而目前的水平还不到十亿马克。
    斯米尔诺夫还谈到关于英国从西德撤出占领军一万三千五百人的决定。他说，撤出的人数还不够多。苏联政府曾经建议从德国撤出三分之一的占领军。
