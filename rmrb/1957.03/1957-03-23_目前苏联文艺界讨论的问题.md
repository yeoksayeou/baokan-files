　　Problems Currently Discussed in Soviet Literary and Art Circles
　　Fang Xuan
    Since the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, a series of meetings have been held in Soviet literary and art circles to criticize the past bureaucracy in the leadership of literary and art work and some shortcomings in literary and art creation caused by the influence of the personality cult. Discussions and debates have been launched on striving for the further prosperity of Soviet literature and art and some issues involving the Marxist-Leninist principles of literature and art. In recent times, the main issues discussed and debated in Soviet literary and art circles have been: the evaluation of the past Soviet life and literary and art development, issues concerning the Party's leadership of literary and art work, and socialist realism. In recent months, the Soviet Ministry of Culture, the Soviet Writers' Union, as well as relevant organizations in the Soviet republics and major cities, and the vast number of Soviet literary and art workers have participated in the discussion of these issues. The following is a simple and comprehensive introduction to these discussions based on recent Soviet newspaper reports.

　  Evaluation of the Past Soviet Life and Literary and Art Development
    The Soviet magazine "New World" published a novel by Dudintsev in its eighth, ninth, and tenth issues of 1956, titled "Not by Bread Alone". This novel tells the story of an inventor in Soviet society who is subjected to endless torment due to bureaucratic obstruction, and it has attracted many readers with its fierce criticism of bureaucracy. This novel has aroused heated debate in Soviet literary and art circles.
    The third issue of the Soviet magazine "Kommunist" this year published an editorial entitled "The Party and the Development of Soviet Literature and Art". The editorial pointed out: "The editorial department of 'New World' magazine did not help the young writer Dudintsev to recognize the incorrect tendencies in his work, but hastily published this novel with its inaccurate summary and distortion of Soviet reality. There is no reason to doubt that the author of the novel had pure motives, and he attempted to condemn bureaucracy and its representatives in our state organs. However, he was enthusiastic about exposing things, lost perspective, and fell into a state of panic. He exaggerated the danger, and essentially regarded bureaucracy in our conditions as an impenetrable wall, and depicted government workers, and even scientific workers, as almost all degenerates. The novel lacks the active and vigorous force of Soviet people under the leadership of the Party who are firing at bureaucracy, and only portrays a few isolated individuals with ardent loyalty who suffer endless torment and hardship because of their loyalty. Instead of calling for a struggle against ugliness in the Leninist way, the novel spreads a sense of decadence and reveals an anarchist attitude towards state organs."
    An article by Sokolsky published in the eleventh issue of the Soviet magazine "Theater" in 1956, entitled "Instead of a Review", also aroused controversy. Throughout the article, the author used sharp language to criticize the activities of the Soviet Bolshoi Theater over the past twenty years, believing that the theater had maintained an extremely cautious attitude in expanding its repertoire, especially in developing the traditions of classical opera. In analyzing the reasons, he said, "...For many years, the Bolshoi Theater directly obeyed and worshiped a certain taste, an indisputable opinion. This greatly limited the theater's initiative and creative possibilities. In this atmosphere, some fixed traditions and habits were formed. One habit was not to think, but to cater; not to create, but to compare with the latest instructions; not to experiment, but to fear not being able to please, to fear making mistakes..."
    Lemishev and Churaki disagreed with Sokolsky's view. In an article they published in the second issue of the Soviet magazine "Kommunist" this year, they believed that the Bolshoi Theater should indeed bravely and greatly expand its repertoire, but they strongly disagreed with Sokolsky's attitude of writing off the theater's activities over the years. In the article, Lemishev and Churaki listed some excellent repertoire performed by the Bolshoi Theater in the past twenty years and some outstanding actors who have emerged, and said,
  "Why is Sokolsky unwilling to see these situations? We feel that his point of view arises from a tendency to obliterate all artistic practices of the past, and all the valuable things painstakingly accumulated by cultural workers who are loyal to the Soviet people and Soviet art, under the guise of struggling against the personality cult. Unfortunately, this tendency now has a certain prevalence in some of our art intellectual circles..."
    The editorials in the Soviet "Literary Gazette" on December 15th last year and January 8th this year criticized one-sided nihilistic views. The editorials said that some literary and art workers, in their struggle against the influence of the personality cult, failed to notice the dominant direction of Soviet society and ignored past achievements. This is a nihilistic tendency. The editorials believed that the past cannot be evaluated from a one-sided point of view.

　  On the Party's Leadership of Literary and Art Work
    In the recent discussions in Soviet literary and art circles, the broad masses of literary and art workers, using the article "The Problem of Backwardness in Drama Creation and Drama Performance" published by Nazarov and Gridneva in the fifth issue of the Soviet magazine "Problems of Philosophy" in 1956 as an example, criticized the remarks of some people, believing that these people adopted a nihilistic attitude towards the past, emphasized "freedom" of creation under the pretext of criticizing past shortcomings, and ignored the Party's leadership of literary and art.
    Nazarov and Gridneva divided the development of Soviet drama into two stages in their article, believing that Soviet drama achieved vigorous development before 1936 because there was freedom of creation at that time, the Party implemented leadership based on patient, comradely criticism, and the widest democracy was practiced in artistic leadership methods; while after 1936, the development of Soviet drama completely stagnated because "starting from the mid-1930s, in the field of art, the concept of 'leadership' became increasingly equivalent to the concept of 'command'. Thus, administrative orders and the widespread use of various repressive measures became the main methods of influencing art. After the war, the influence of the personality cult became even more serious." Nazarov and Gridneva concluded their article by saying, "Life proves that in the field of literature and art, the method of autonomy is the most reliable way to realize Lenin's requirement of 'less leadership and more practical work'. In dramatic art, we should also abandon direct and frequent 'leadership' from top to bottom, and we must give dramatic art extensive autonomy. As for what the form of autonomy should be, this should be carefully discussed. Obviously, it would be most appropriate to let the Ministry of Culture no longer manage art issues, and to establish an Academy of Art or an Academy of Literature and Art."
    Soviet Minister of Culture Mikhailov published an article in the Soviet "Culture Newspaper" on December 1st last year, expressing disagreement with many of the views in Nazarov and Gridneva's article. He said, "Comrades Nazarov and Gridneva are trying to force readers to accept the idea that direct and frequent 'leadership from top to bottom' must be abandoned." Mikhailov then used facts to refute the claim that Soviet art experienced a period of stagnation. Nazarov and Gridneva expressed the idea in their article that "free competition - this is the manifestation of creative freedom; while administrative orders and the rejection of free competition undermine this freedom and create a certain dependence in creation." Mikhailov pointed out specifically when talking about this point, "We should not forget this principle of Marxism-Leninism: in modern society, there can be no literature and art independent of politics and class struggle. ...The creative freedom of Soviet writers, artists, and actors - this is the freedom to create works that should serve the great and lofty ideals of striving for the victory of communism."
    Three Soviet philosophers, Nikolayev, Dalmatov, and Fedorov, published an article in "Pravda" believing that the article "The Problem of Backwardness in Drama Creation and Drama Performance" generally described the state of Soviet drama in the past twenty years or so as a black spot, advocating "freedom of creation", and in essence opposing the Party's leadership of literature and art.
    The editorial "Hold Higher the Banner of Marxist-Leninist Thought" in the first issue of the Soviet "Kommunist" magazine this year also emphasized the issue of the Party's leadership of literature and art. The editorial pointed out: "Our public opinion cannot but resolutely counter the attacks of individuals, even if they are a minority, on one of the main principles of socialist ideology, including literature and art - the leading role of the Party. Gorky once reminded writers that literature should understand its role as inspiring greater enthusiasm, and without the ideological leadership of the Party, it is inconceivable to do so. ...However, some individual literary and art workers want to doubt this truth. For example, the remarks made by writer Simonov in the article published in the twelfth issue of 'New World' magazine in 1956 are like this. Simonov tried his best to prove that Fadeyev, a writer who has always been thoughtful and strict with himself, seemed to have made the novel 'The Young Guard' worse after accepting the Party's criticism and making creative revisions to it, the reason being that Fadeyev added chapters reflecting the leadership and guidance of the Communist Party and its local organizations in the severe years of the Great Patriotic War. Why did Simonov want to doubt the will of one of our outstanding writers? Isn't it in order to repeat the old tunes that have long been rebuked? The purpose of these old tunes is ultimately to 'liberate' literature from 'Party guardianship', to advocate the so-called freedom of creation that foreign bourgeois liberals are now clamoring for. Some individual literary and art workers have also made some remarks that simply scold our Party for the resolutions it made on ideological issues from 1946 to 1948."
    The opinion of Soviet writer Simonov is as follows. In the article he published in the aforementioned "New World" magazine, he specifically talked about a special article published in the Soviet "Literature and Life Newspaper" in the autumn of 1947 criticizing writer Fadeyev's novel "The Young Guard". He disagreed with many of the criticisms in this article. He believed that this critical article, as the Party's point of view, had two bad influences: first, the article said that "the Soviet people's anti-fascist war was organized from the beginning". Simonov believed that this whitewashed statement made many writers give up writing about the early stages of the war because they were unwilling to violate the truth; second, this criticism made Fadeyev revise the novel with a heavy heart. Simonov said that some people, including himself, still liked the unrevised "The Young Guard", and some people liked the revised novel. But if the critical article had only made some criticisms without requiring the author to revise it, then Fadeyev could have used the four years he spent revising the novel to complete his epic "The Last of the Udege".
    At the end of last year, the Soviet Ministry of Culture convened a meeting of representatives from the art circles to discuss the development of fine arts. Soviet First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Molotov, in his speech at the meeting, criticized the administrative orders and bureaucratic factors in the leadership of fine arts, and also emphasized the necessity of the Party's in-depth and constant leadership in artistic creation. He said: We advocate that the guiding ideology in art should not be replaced by administrative means, but we demand that our artists' creations have a high degree of Bolshevik ideology.

　　Views on Socialist Realism
    One of the many important issues recently discussed in Soviet literary and art circles is socialist realism. The discussion surrounding this issue has two aspects. One aspect is whether socialist realism is good or not, and the other involves understanding the method of socialist realism.
    In the discussion of socialist realism in Soviet literary and art circles, some individuals have doubts about socialist realism. For example, at the meeting of the Moscow branch of the Soviet Writers' Union in mid-November last year to discuss Soviet drama issues, the speech by children's literature writer Kubarev was generally opposed, because he suggested "abolishing" socialist realism, believing that the socialist realism method was unfounded and that it hindered the development of drama.
  Recently, literary and art workers in various parts of the Soviet Union have refuted the arguments that the socialist realism method is "unfounded", "imperfect", and "limited" at some meetings and in newspapers, and reiterated their firm socialist realism position. For example, the "Letter to All Literary and Art Workers of Soviet Ukraine" passed at the recent meeting convened by the Ministry of Culture of the Ukrainian Republic pointed out: "Those who want to abandon the method of socialist realism are like an unfortunate captain who sails into the sea and wants to 'freely' steer the ship, so he throws the compass overboard."
    The "Letter to Writers and Young Literary and Art Workers of the Lithuanian Republic" passed at the enlarged meeting of the Lithuanian Writers' Association not long ago also said, "We should argue. Ideological stagnation and lack of criticism are particularly harmful to creative work. But the object of our argument will not be the kind of fabricated questions such as 'Does socialist realism exist? Is socialist realism good or bad?' Life itself and the practice of multinational Soviet literature have proved the historical law and vitality of socialist realism."
    At the aforementioned meeting convened by the Soviet Ministry of Culture to discuss the development of fine arts, the vast majority of people confirmed that only on the road of socialist realism can true creative achievements be obtained, believing that socialist realism gives creation broad possibilities. At the end of the meeting, Comrade Molotov emphasized in his speech that the socialist realism method is the basis for future artistic creation.
    In understanding the socialist realism method itself, some people in Soviet literary and art circles in the debate believe that it is more appropriate to say socialist realism "principle" than socialist realism "method". Simonov has such a view. In the article he published in the twelfth issue of "New World" magazine last year, he said that the statement in the Writers' Association charter that socialist realism is the basic method of Soviet literature and art has caused controversy among writers. He believes that the two words "method" are debatable, because "method" can also be interpreted as "technique" and "style", which seems to limit the possibility of stylistic diversification for artists, so it is more correct to say "principle" instead of "method".
      Many people disagree with Simonov's opinion. They said that the issue is not to generally talk about the two words "method", but to talk about the socialist realism method, that is, the artistic creation method that includes recognizing and describing reality in artistic images. We cannot abandon the concept of this creative method as an artistic method of understanding reality.
    Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Shepilov pointed out at the All-Union Congress of Artists on March 2: A suggestion has been put forward in newspapers and at artists' meetings: do not regard socialist realism as a method of creation, but as the artist's worldview. The dispute here is not a matter of a noun, but it concerns very important things. The view of treating socialist realism as a worldview rather than a creative method will only confuse important concepts and open the way for subjectivism.
    There are still many issues in the Soviet debate on realism and socialist realism. For example, the Soviet art circles have launched a heated debate on the comparison between impressionism and realism, because some individuals believe that impressionism is realism, and it seems to be a further development of realism. The Soviet "Gorky Institute of World Literature" is preparing to invite well-known writers and artists from all over the Soviet Union to hold a discussion on realism issues in April this year. This discussion will make a comprehensive analysis of realism and socialist realism from a theoretical and historical perspective.
                  ×　×　×
    Currently, the discussion in Soviet literary and art circles is still ongoing. These discussions, as pointed out in the Soviet newspapers, are of great significance for further promoting Soviet literature and art and enlivening the creative life of Soviet writers.

　　目前苏联文艺界讨论的问题
　　方萱
    自从苏联共产党第二十次代表大会以来，苏联文艺界召开了一系列的会议，批评了过去文艺工作领导上的官僚主义和文艺创作上因个人崇拜的影响而产生的一些缺点，对争取苏联文艺进一步的繁荣和一些涉及马克思列宁主义文艺原则的问题展开了讨论和争论。最近一个时期，苏联文艺界讨论和争论的主要问题是：对过去苏联生活和文艺发展的估价、关于党对文艺工作的领导和社会主义现实主义等问题。最近几个月来，苏联文化部、苏联作家协会以及苏联各加盟共和国、各大城市的有关组织和苏联广大的文艺工作者都参加了这些问题的讨论。下面是根据苏联最近报刊的报道，对这些讨论作一简单和综合的介绍。
　  对过去苏联生活和文艺发展的估价
    苏联“新世界”杂志1956年第八、九、十期上刊登了杜金采夫写的一部小说，题目是“不仅仅靠面包”。这部小说是叙述苏维埃社会中一个发明者受到官僚主义的千方阻碍无限折磨的故事，它以对官僚主义的激烈批评吸引着很多读者。这部小说在苏联文艺界引起了热烈的争论。
    今年第三期苏联“共产党人”杂志发表了一篇题为“党和苏联文艺发展问题”的社论。社论中指出：“‘新世界’杂志编辑部没有帮助青年作家杜金采夫去认识作品中不正确的倾向，而匆匆忙忙发表了这部内容概括得不正确、歪曲苏联现实的小说。没有理由去怀疑，小说的作者是出于纯正的动机的，他企图斥责我们国家机关中的官僚主义及其代表。但是他热衷于揭露，失去了远景，陷入惊惶失措的境地，他把危险性扩大了，把在我国条件下的官僚主义实质上当做一面击不破的墙，把机关工作人员，甚至把科学工作人员形容成几乎全都是蜕化分子。小说中没有在党的领导下向官僚主义开火的苏维埃人的活跃而雄厚的力量，而仅仅是一些孤零零的赤胆忠心的人在反对官僚主义，他们由于自己的忠诚而遭到无限的折磨和苦难。小说没有按照列宁的方式号召向丑恶作斗争，而是散布一种颓丧情绪，流露出对国家机关的无政府的态度。”
    索科里斯基在1956年第十一期苏联“戏剧”杂志上发表的一篇文章“代评论”也引起了争论。作者在全篇文章中以尖锐的笔调指责了苏联大剧院二十多年来的活动，认为大剧院过去在扩大剧目特别是发展古典歌剧的传统上抱有一种异常谨小慎微的态度。他在分析原因时说道，“……大剧院许多年以来就是直接服从和崇拜一种口味，一种不可争论的意见。这在很大的程度上限制住了剧院的积极性和创作的可能。在这种气氛中就形成了一些固定的传统和习惯，有一种习惯就是，不去思考，而是迎合，不去创作，而是对照最近的指令，不去实验，而是害怕不能讨好，害怕犯错误……”。
    列米谢夫和楚拉基不同意索科里斯基这种说法，他们在今年第二期苏联“共产党人”杂志上发表的文章中认为大剧院的确应当勇敢地大大扩大剧目，可是很不同意索科里斯基把大剧院多年的活动一笔勾销的态度。列米谢夫和楚拉基在文章中列举了大剧院在最近二十年来上演的一些优秀剧目和涌现出的一些优秀演员，并且说，
  “为什么索科里斯基不愿意看到这些情况呢？我们觉得，他的观点是从这样一种倾向产生的，这种倾向就是，在反对个人崇拜的斗争形式下，把以往年代里的一切艺术实践，把忠实于苏联人民和苏联艺术的文化工作者辛勤积累的一切宝贵的东西都一概抹煞，遗憾的是，这种倾向现在在我们部分艺术知识界里有一定的普遍性……”。
    去年12月15日和今年1月8日的苏联“文学报”社论批评了片面性的虚无主义观点。社论说，有些文艺工作者在同个人崇拜的影响作斗争时，没有注意到苏联社会的主导方向，忽视了以往的成就。这是一种虚无主义的倾向。社论认为，不能以片面的观点估价过去。
　  关于党对文艺工作的领导
    在最近苏联文艺界的讨论中，广大文艺工作者都以纳扎罗夫和格里德涅娃在苏联“哲学问题”杂志1956年第五期上发表的文章“戏剧创作和戏剧演出的落后问题”作例子，批评一些人的言论，认为这些人以虚无主义的态度对待过去，借口批评过去的缺点，强调创作“自由”，忽视党对文艺的领导。
    纳扎罗夫和格里德涅娃在文章中把苏联戏剧的发展分为两个阶段，认为在1936年以前苏联戏剧获得了蓬勃的发展，原因是那时有创作自由，党实现了以耐心的、同志式的批评为基础的领导，在艺术领导方法上实行了最广泛的民主；而在1936以后苏联戏剧的发展完全陷于停滞状态，原因是“从三十年代中期开始，在艺术领域里，‘领导’的概念越来越相等于‘命令’的概念。于是行政命令和广泛运用各种各样的压制办法就成为影响艺术的主要方法。战后，个人崇拜的影响更加严重了。”纳扎罗夫和格里德涅娃在文章结尾说道，“生活证明，在文学和艺术领域里，自治的方法最能保证实现列宁提出的‘少去领导，而多作实际工作’的要求。在戏剧艺术中也应该放弃自上而下的直接的和经常的‘领导’，必须给予戏剧艺术广泛的自治权。至于自治的形式应该怎样，这要好好地加以讨论，显然，让文化部不再管理艺术问题，成立艺术研究院或文学和艺术研究院，这是最恰当的了。”
    苏联文化部长米哈伊洛夫在去年12月1日苏联“文化报”上发表了一篇文章，对纳扎罗夫和格里德涅娃这篇文章的许多观点表示不同意。他说，“纳扎罗夫和格里德涅娃同志硬要使读者接受这样一种思想：必须放弃直接的和经常的‘自上而下的领导’。”米哈伊洛夫接着用事实反驳了苏联艺术经历了一段停滞时期的说法。纳扎罗夫和格里德涅娃在文章中表达了这种思想，即“自由竞赛——这是创作自由的表现；而行政命令和拒绝自由竞赛则破坏这种自由，而且造成创作的某种依赖”。米哈伊洛夫在谈到这一点时特别指出，“不应该忘记马克思列宁主义的这一原理：在现代社会里，不可能有脱离政治、阶级斗争而独立的文学和艺术。……苏联作家、艺术家和演员的创作自由——这是创作这样一种作品的自由，这种作品应该为争取共产主义胜利的伟大而崇高的思想服务。”
    苏联三位哲学家尼古拉也夫、达尔马托夫和费多罗夫在“真理报”上发表文章认为，“戏剧创作和戏剧演出的落后问题”这篇文章把苏联最近二十多年的戏剧状况笼统地形容成一片黑斑，主张“创作自由”，实质上是反对党对文艺的领导。
    苏联“共产党人”杂志今年第一期的社论“更高地举起马克思列宁主义思想的旗帜”中也强调了党对文艺的领导问题。社论中指出，“我们的舆论界对于个别的人，即或是少数人对包括文艺在内的社会主义思想的主要原则之一——党的领导作用——的攻击不能不予以坚决的回击。高尔基曾经提醒作家说，文学应当把自己的作用理解为激发起更大的热情，如果没有党的思想领导，作到这一点是不可思议的。……但是，有个别的文艺工作者却想怀疑这个真理。例如作家西蒙诺夫在1956年第十二期‘新世界’杂志里发表的文章中的言论就是这样。西蒙诺夫尽力证明，一向是深思熟虑、严格要求自己的作家法捷耶夫，在接受了党的批评并且对小说‘青年近卫军’作了创造性的修改后，似乎反倒使这部作品变得糟糕了，原因就是，法捷耶夫增添了反映共产党和它的地方组织在伟大卫国战争的严峻的年代里的领导和指导作用的篇章。西蒙诺夫为什么要去怀疑我们杰出的作家之一的作者的意愿呢？难道说不是为了重弹早已备遭斥责的老调吗？这些老调的目的归根结底就在于使文学从‘党的监护’下‘解放出来’，就在于鼓吹目前外国的资产阶级自由主义者百般叫嚷的所谓创作自由。个别的文艺工作者还发出一些言论，简直是责骂我们党在1946年至1948年作的关于思想问题方面的决议。”
    苏联作家西蒙诺夫的意见是这样的。他在上述“新世界”杂志发表的文章里专门谈到了1947年秋天在苏联“文学和生活报”上刊登的一篇批评作家法捷耶夫的小说“青年近卫军”的专文。他不同意这篇文章中的很多批评，他认为这篇作为党的观点的批评文章起了两种不好的影响：第一，文章中说道“苏联人民反法西斯的战争从一开始就是有组织的”，西蒙诺夫认为这种粉饰现实的说法使得很多作家因不愿违反真实情况而放弃了描写战争初期的写作意图；第二，这个批评使得法捷耶夫怀着沉痛的心情去修改这部小说。西蒙诺夫说，有些人，连他自己在内还是喜欢没有修改过的“青年近卫军”，也有一些人喜欢修改过的这部小说。可是如果那篇批评文章仅限于提出一些批评意见，而不要求作者修改的话，那么法捷耶夫满可以利用修改小说的四年时间来完成他的史诗“乌兑格的末裔”。
    去年年底苏联文化部召集了广大艺术界代表开会讨论造型艺术发展的问题。苏联部长会议第一副主席莫洛托夫在会议上的发言中，批评了造型艺术领导上的行政命令和官僚主义的因素，同时也强调了党对艺术创作方面深入的、时刻的领导的必要性。他说：我们主张艺术中的领导思想不要被行政手段所代替，但是我们要求我们的艺术家的创作要有高度的、布尔什维克式的思想性。
　　对社会主义现实主义的看法
    苏联文艺界最近讨论的许多重要问题之一，是关于社会主义现实主义。围绕着这一问题的讨论有两个方面。一方面是关于社会主义现实主义好不好的问题，另一方面涉及到对社会主义现实主义方法的理解。
    苏联广大的文艺工作者在讨论社会主义现实主义问题中，有个别的人对社会主义现实主义发生怀疑。例如，去年11月中旬在苏联作家协会莫斯科分会理事会讨论苏联戏剧问题的会议上，儿童文学作家古巴列夫的发言遭到了普遍的反对，因为他建议“取消”社会主义现实主义，认为社会主义现实主义方法是无根据的，认为它给戏剧的发展造成了阻碍。
  最近，苏联各地的文艺工作者在一些会议上，在报刊上纷纷驳斥了所谓社会主义现实主义方法“无根据”、“不完善”、
  “有局限性”的论调，重申了自己坚定的社会主义现实主义的立场。例如，在最近乌克兰共和国文化部召集的会议上通过的
  “告苏维埃乌克兰全体文艺工作者书”中指出：“想要放弃社会主义现实主义方法的人，就像一个时运不佳的船长一样，他驶到大海中要想‘自由地’驾驶舰船，就把指南针抛出船外。”
    在不久以前立陶宛作家协会理事会扩大会议上通过的“告立陶宛共和国作家和青年文艺工作者书”中也说道，“我们应当争论。思想停顿、没有批评对创作工作来说特别有害。但是我们争论的对象将不是类似‘社会主义现实主义存在不存在？社会主义现实主义是好还是不好？’这一类无中生有的问题。生活本身和多民族的苏维埃文学实践，证明了社会主义现实主义的历史规律性和生命力。”
    在上述苏联文化部召集的讨论有关造型艺术发展问题的会议上，绝大多数的人都确认，只有在社会主义现实主义的道路上才能获得真正的创作成果，认为社会主义现实主义给予创作以广泛的可能。会议结束时，莫洛托夫同志在发言中强调指出，社会主义现实主义方法是今后艺术创作的基础。
    对社会主义现实主义方法本身的理解上，苏联文艺界在争论中有人认为与其说社会主义现实主义“方法”不如说社会主义现实主义“原则”更恰当些。西蒙诺夫就有这样的见解。他在去年第十二期“新世界”杂志里发表的文章中说道，作家协会章程里关于社会主义现实主义是苏联文艺的基本方法的表述，在作家间引起了争论。他认为“方法”这两个字是可争论的，因为“方法”也可解释成“手法”和
  “方式”，这样似乎就限制了艺术家在风格上多样化的可能性，所以不说“方法”而说“原则”比较正确些。
      西蒙诺夫的这个意见有很多人不同意。他们说，问题不是一般地谈论“方法”这两个字，而是谈社会主义现实主义方法，即包括在艺术形象中认识和描述现实的艺术创作方法，我们不能摒弃作为认识现实的艺术方法的这个创作方法的概念。
    苏联共产党中央委员会书记谢皮洛夫在3月2日全苏美术家代表大会上发言指出：在报纸上和在美术家会议上提出了这样一个建议：不要把社会主义现实主义看作是创作的方法，而看作是艺术家的世界观。这里的争论不是一个名词的问题，而是关系到非常重要的东西。把社会主义现实主义当作世界观、而不当作创作方法的这种见解，只会使得重要的概念混淆起来，并且为主观主义打开道路。
    苏联关于现实主义和社会主义现实主义争论中的问题还有很多，例如，苏联美术界曾在印象主义和现实主义的比较上展开了热烈的争论，因为有个别的人认为印象主义就是现实主义，似乎是现实主义进一步的发展。苏联“高尔基世界文学研究所”准备在今年4月份邀请全苏各地的著名文学家、艺术家举行关于现实主义问题的讨论。这次讨论将从理论上、历史上对现实主义和社会主义现实主义作出全面的分析。
                  ×　×　×
    目前，苏联文艺界的讨论还在进行着。这些讨论，正像苏联报刊所指出的，对于进一步繁荣苏联的文艺、活跃苏联作家的创作生活有着重要的意义。
