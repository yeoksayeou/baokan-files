    Worker-Peasant Get-Together Strengthens Fraternal Friendship
　　Our Correspondent in Shanxi
    Not long ago, Shanxi Province launched a province-wide worker-peasant get-together. Among the worker-peasant get-togethers in recent years, this year's was the largest in scale. Worker representatives from various cities were dispatched to rural areas throughout the province for visits, and representatives from agricultural cooperatives throughout the province also gathered in Taiyuan for visits. This activity dispelled various misunderstandings and developed friendship between workers and peasants.
    With the realization of socialist agricultural cooperativization in Shanxi Province, the worker-peasant alliance has been further consolidated, and mutual support between industry and agriculture has been greatly enhanced. However, since 1956, some peasants have developed some misunderstandings, believing that "workers' labor is light, their treatment is high, and their lives are good; peasants' labor is heavy, their income is low, and their lives are hard." This misunderstanding hinders the further consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance.
    The Origin of Misunderstandings
    The peasants' misunderstanding of the workers did not arise out of thin air. This is mainly because they came into contact with some workers: these people had left the countryside for only a short time, worked as temporary workers in factories or mines or construction sites for a few days, and had not received a good education. So when they returned to their hometowns, they showed off and looked down on everyone.
    Therefore, when hundreds of worker representatives from Taiyuan went to visit twenty-five mountainous counties, many peasants were initially unwilling to approach them. There is such a vivid story. The ninth branch of the worker representative visiting group composed of eight units including Shanxi Provincial Construction Engineering Company visited the Five-Star Agricultural Cooperative in Dongmafang Township, Ningwu County. When the comrades arrived in the village, they enthusiastically greeted the peasant brothers and asked the peasants to sit down and watch a movie together, but people always walked far away. Later, Dr. Shen from the delegation treated the peasants, and the engineering technicians taught the agricultural cooperative cadres knowledge of repairing dams. The relationship between workers and peasants gradually became closer. At a symposium, representatives from both sides introduced the production and living conditions. An old man in the agricultural cooperative said, "Alas! Only now do we know the workers. They are different from Gong Gui-ru." At this time, everyone in the room nodded in agreement. Gong Bin, the secretary of the township party branch, also said: "Yes, everyone says you don't look like Gong Gui-ru who came back from the city." Worker representative and youth shock brigade leader Chang Hongbin heard this familiar name and asked, "Is Gong Gui-ru the young man who has changed his name to Gong Gui-xi?" Gong Bin said yes. Chang Hongbin said, "Gong Gui-xi is in the same shock brigade as me in Taiyuan Municipal Engineering Company. He works under my leadership." Everyone listened and spoke in more detail, and asked more questions. People said: Gong Gui-ru only talked about the workers' life enjoyment when he came back for the festival, but he didn't talk about the production situation. He went home wearing a short coat, and also paid someone to carry his luggage for him. When he walked up to us, he covered his nose and mouth, complaining that the people in the countryside were dirty and smelly. How could you be so kind to us as soon as you came? Gong Bin asked, "How much does he earn a month on the construction site?" Chang Hongbin replied, "Thirty-nine yuan." At this time, the meeting place was in an uproar, and people said: "But he said he earned sixty yuan when he came back. You should educate this kind of worker well." On the day the worker delegation left, the peasants were no longer indifferent, but reluctant to leave.
    This incident powerfully illustrates what kind of bad consequences weak ideological work can cause! Although not all returning temporary workers are as vain as Gong Gui-ru, it is a fact that many people have left a bad impression on the peasants because they did not comprehensively introduce the workers' situation. Through the extensive visits of the worker delegations, the peasants felt that the workers were kind and amiable brothers.
　　Workers' Labor Is Not Easy
    More than a thousand agricultural cooperative representatives who came to Taiyuan also experienced such a transformation process. The vast majority of them were unfamiliar with the living and working conditions of industrial workers. Therefore, before visiting the factories and mines, they had various questions. After they saw the new factories with good working conditions and the old factories with poor working conditions, browsed many workshops where miners were producing, and visited the workers' residential areas, all the questions were answered.
    The most practical person was Jing Yanghe, a member of the Heping Agricultural Cooperative in Quyu Township, Jincheng. He used to love to say the phrase "workers work really leisurely." Therefore, no matter which factory he went to, he looked at it very carefully. Walking into the steelmaking workshop of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, he saw the cranes moving back and forth overhead, the steel plates under his feet trembling from the machines, and his face burning hot from the furnace. At this time, the workers were enthusiastically operating under high temperatures. He stepped out of the crowd of visitors, picked up the tools used by the workers, and tested the weight to see if they were lighter than the peasants' labor tools. "Good fellow," he said to himself, "it's several times heavier than the clumsy hoe we use!" He was admiring the worker elders in his heart when a worker came over and said to him, "You've worked hard!" He quickly shook the other's hand and said sincerely, "You are the ones who really work hard!" In this way, after the peasant representatives saw the factories, no one said that the workers' labor was easy anymore. They all said in unison: When we work in the fields, we even have to look up to see a crow flying in the sky. But the worker elders, who are not working with concentration? It's really that their hands and feet can't stop, their eyes can't look around, and their minds can't think wildly. The old farmer Song Jinshan, who came from the agricultural cooperative led by Li Shunda, said: "If we peasants also work as hard as the workers, we will definitely produce more grain and strive for a great agricultural harvest this year."
    Originally, everyone said: workers have high salaries and good lives, while peasants have low incomes and hard lives. After the visit, the statements all changed. Guo Huacheng from the Victory Agricultural Cooperative in Tunliu County calculated an account. The worker elders in some factories produce goods worth 13,000 yuan a year, and their wages only account for 10% of their production. In addition to costs, much of the value of their production is used for construction. Last year, the Victory Agricultural Cooperative had 6.7 cents per labor day, and one person produced goods worth only 130 yuan for two hundred labor days a year, and agricultural tax accounted for only 8%. Therefore, everyone said: The worker elders create great value for the country, work hard, and deserve higher treatment than us.
　  Peasant Incomes Increase Year by Year
    So, is the peasants' income low? Ju Erzhu from the Guangyao Agricultural Cooperative in Liulin Township, Zuoquan County, answered this question. He said that their agricultural cooperative has been increasing its income year by year since embarking on the road of mutual assistance and cooperation. In 1953, each person could only eat 270 jin of grain, 314 jin in 1954, 360 jin in 1955, and 395 jin in 1956. Last year, each family also increased its sideline income by 42 yuan. He said: "I am an ordinary family in our cooperative, and it is not difficult to eat and use. In 1946, we were liberated there. At that time, the whole family of five only had one tattered quilt. I had to cover myself with a burlap bag. By last year, not only did everyone have a quilt, but everyone also added a mattress and bought a wool blanket, and I also wore a short coat." The situation of general improvement in living standards can actually be seen from the clothing of the peasants who came to Taiyuan this time. A few years ago, not many peasant representatives who came to Taiyuan for meetings wore fine cloth. This time, almost all of them wore fine cloth. These facts also prove that the peasants' lives are not hard, but are improving year by year. However, why do some people shout that life is hard? They said: This is because they are not content and only listen to rumors that the workers' lives are good. In fact, although workers' lives are better, the situation in cities and rural areas is different. Peasants can eat vegetables and live in houses without spending money, while workers have to calculate expenses for food, clothing, housing, and transportation.
  　Learn from Each Other and Support Each Other
    The visit not only eliminated the above-mentioned misunderstandings of more than a thousand agricultural cooperative representatives, but also made them discover various unexpected shortcomings. After seeing the steel plant, they thought of the double-wheeled double-shared plow produced by the workers. After seeing the textile factory, they thought of the clothes they were wearing. After seeing the chemical factory, they thought of the chemical fertilizers and "666" produced by the workers for improving crop yields. After seeing the impurities removed from wheat by the workers in the flour mill, they wondered if the public grain they handed over was not clean... All of this made them very excited. Mo Erhai, director of the "July 1st" Agricultural Cooperative in Licheng County, said: "Looking at the worker elders, who is not supporting us? But, we are not happy to sell a little more surplus grain. In the past, people often said that workers and peasants are brothers. I always mumbled: Brothers are brothers, but Chairman Mao only loves the older brother and does not love the younger brother. Now I understand that Chairman Mao loves both brothers equally. I have been the director of the cooperative for a few years, and today I understand what the worker-peasant alliance is." Although their agricultural cooperative sold more than 20,000 jin of surplus grain last year than the year before, when he saw that the hard-working workers were still eating some coarse grain, he said: "We still have more than 10,000 jin of grain stored in our cooperative. In addition to the part that should be given to the members, we will definitely sell the remaining grain to the state when we go back this time."
    Many people said: We will work hard to produce grain and cotton, plant more oil crops and raise more pigs to support industry. We will also widely publicize what we have seen with our own eyes, educate everyone to learn from the worker elders' spirit of hard work, and educate everyone not to compare enjoyment, but to compare whether mutual support is sufficient.

### 工农联欢加强了手足之谊

    工农联欢加强了手足之谊
　　本报驻山西记者
    不久以前，山西省展开了一次全省规模的工农联欢活动。在近几年来的工农联欢活动中，要数今年的规模最大。各个城市都有工人代表分散到全省各地农村去进行访问，全省各地也派有农业社的代表汇集太原市进行参观。这次活动消除了各种误解，发展了工农之间的友谊。
    随着山西省社会主义农业合作化的实现，工农联盟已更加巩固，工业和农业之间的相互支援已大大增强。但是，1956年以来，在部分农民中产生了一些误解，认为“工人的劳动轻，待遇高，生活好；农民的劳动重，收入少，生活苦”。这种误解阻碍着工农联盟的进一步巩固。
    误解的由来
    农民对工人的误解，不是凭空产生的。这主要是由于他们接触了一部分这样的工人：这些人离开农村的时间很短，到城市的厂矿或工地当了几天临时工，又没有受到很好的教育，于是回乡便抖威风，把谁也不放在眼里。
    因此，当太原市的数百名职工代表前往二十五个山区县份进行访问的时候，好些地方的农民起初都不愿意同他们接近。有这样一件生动的事。由山西省建筑工程公司等八个单位组成的工人代表访问团第九分团，访问了宁武县东马坊乡五星农业社，同志们到村便热情地问候农民兄弟们，请农民们一起坐下看电影，人们却总是走得远远的，后来代表团里的沈大夫替农民们治病，工程技术人员教给农业社干部修水坝的知识，工农之间渐渐亲热了些。在一次座谈会上，双方的代表介绍了生产和生活情况，农业社里的一位老大爷说：“唉！这一下我们才认识了工人。原来跟龚桂如是不一样的。”这时屋里的人都点头称是。乡党支部书记龚斌也说：“是呀，人人都说你们不像从城里回来的龚桂如”。工人代表、青年突击队长常洪斌听到这个熟悉的名字便问：“龚桂如是不是已经改名龚桂喜的那个青年？”龚斌说不错。常洪斌说：“龚桂喜同我在太原市政工程公司一个突击队里，他在我的领导下工作。”大家听了，说的更详细了，提的问题也更多了。人们说：龚桂如过节回来，光谈工人的生活享受，不谈生产的情形。他回家身穿短大衣，还花钱雇人替他背行李，走到我们跟前就捂住嘴鼻，嫌乡里的人脏臭哩。哪里像你们一来就对我们这样亲热。龚斌问道：“他在工地里一月收入多少？”常洪斌答道：“三十九元。”这时会场上乱哄哄的，人们说：“可他回来说他收入六十元。你们应当好好教育这种工人啊。”在工人代表团离别那天，农民们再不是冷冷淡淡，而是依依不舍了。
    这件事有力地说明了思想工作薄弱会造成怎样的恶果！虽然许多返乡的临时工不全像龚桂如那样具有浓厚的虚荣心，但是不少人由于不全面介绍工人的情况，给农民们留下了不好的印象却是事实。通过工人代表团的广泛访问，农民们都感到工人是和蔼可亲的兄弟。
　　工人的劳动并不轻松
    千余名来太原的农业社代表，也经历了这样的转变过程。他们中绝大多数对产业工人的生活和劳动情况是陌生的。因此在参观厂矿之前，都怀着各种疑问。他们在看了劳动条件良好的新厂和劳动条件较差的老厂，浏览了许多厂矿工人进行生产的车间，到职工住宅区进行了访问以后，各种疑问都找到了答案。
    最讲实际的人要数晋城?峪乡和平农业社的社员荆阳和了。他原来是顶爱说“工人干活真清闲”这句话的。所以，无论到那个工厂，他看的也顶仔细。走进太原钢铁厂炼钢车间里，他看到头顶上吊车来回跑动，脚下的钢板被机器震得颤抖，脸皮被火炉烤得火辣辣的，这时工人们却热情地在高温下操作着。他从参观的人群里迈步走出，去拿起工人们操作用的工具，试了试重量，看看是不是比农民劳动工具轻些。“好家伙，”他自言自语地说“比咱使的那笨重的镢头还重好几倍呢！”他正在心里赞佩工人老大哥，一个工人走了过来，对他说：“辛苦了！”他连忙握着对方的手，诚挚地说：“你们才真辛苦啊！”就这样，农民代表们在看了工厂以后，再没有一个人说工人劳动清闲了。他们异口同声地表示：我们在地里劳动，连天上飞过一只乌鸦也要抬起头来看看。可是工人老大哥，谁不是在聚精会神的干活。真是手足不能停，眼不能东张西望，脑筋不能胡思乱想。从李顺达领导的农业社里来的老农宋金山说：“要是我们农民也像工人一样地紧张劳动，肯定还会多打粮食，准能争取到今年的农业大丰收。”
    原来大家都说：工人的待遇高生活好，农民的收入少生活苦。经过参观以后，说法全变了。屯留县胜利农业社郭花城算了一笔账，有的工厂的工人老大哥，一个人在一年生产的东西值一万三千元，得的工资只占他生产的10％，除了成本，他们生产的价值许多都用到建设上去了。胜利农业社去年每个劳动日六角七分钱，一个人一年作二百个劳动日，才生产了价值一百三十元的东西，交农业税只占8％。所以人人都说：工人老大哥给国家创造的价值大，劳动辛勤，待遇比我们高些是应该的。
　  农民收入逐年提高
    那么，是不是农民的收入就少呢？左权县柳林乡光耀农业社巨二珠解答了这个问题。他说他们农业社自从走上互助合作道路以来，收入是逐年提高的，1953年每人只能吃到二百七十斤粮食，1954年三百一十四斤，1955年三百六十斤，1956年三百九十五斤，去年每家人还增加了四十二元的副业收入。他说：“我在我们社里是生活平平常常的人家，吃用都不困难。1946年我们那里获得解放，当时全家五口人只一条破被，我只好盖麻布口袋，到去年为止，不仅一人有了一条被，还每人添了一条褥子，买了一条线毯，我还穿了短大衣。”生活普遍提高的情形，其实从这次来太原的农民的穿戴上就可以看到，前几年到太原开会的农民代表，穿细布的并不多。这次来的几乎全穿了细布。这些事实也证明：农民生活并不苦，而是逐年有所改善的。但是，为什么又有人嚷叫生活苦呢？他们说：这是由于不知足，光听了谣传说工人的生活好。其实工人生活虽然比较好些，但城市和农村的情况不一样，农民吃菜住房可以不花钱，工人衣食住行都要计算开支。
  　互相学习互相支援
    参观不仅使千余名农业社的代表消除了上述那些误解，还使他们发现了各种想不到的缺点。看了钢铁厂，他们想起了工人生产的双轮双铧犁，看了纺织厂，他们想起了身上穿的衣，看了化学厂，他们想起了工人生产的化学肥料和“六六六”对提高农作物产量的作用，看了面粉厂工人从小麦里清除出来的杂物，想起了自己交的公粮是不是不干净……这一切一切，使他们内心非常激动。黎城县“七一”农业社主任莫二孩说：“看看工人老大哥，谁不在支援我们，可是，我们多卖了点余粮，心里就不乐意。从前，人们常说工人农民是兄弟，我就老嘀咕：兄弟倒是兄弟，就是毛主席只疼哥哥，不疼弟弟。现在我才懂得，毛主席爱这两兄弟是一样的。我当了几年社主任，今天算懂得了什么是工农联盟了。”他们农业社去年虽比前年多卖了两万多斤余粮，但是当他看到辛勤劳动的工人们还吃了一部分粗粮以后，就说：“我们社里还存了一万多斤粮食，除了应给社员的一部分，这次回去一定把剩余的再卖给国家。”
    许多人都表示：回去努力生产粮食棉花，多种油料作物多喂猪来支援工业，更要广泛宣传自己亲眼看到的东西，教育大家学习工人老大哥不畏艰苦的劳动热情，教育大家不要比享受，而应当比相互支援做得够不够。
