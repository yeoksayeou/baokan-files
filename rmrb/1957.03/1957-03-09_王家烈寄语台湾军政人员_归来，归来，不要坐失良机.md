    Wang Jialie's Message to Military and Government Personnel in Taiwan
    Return, Return, Don't Miss the Opportunity
    It is with great honor and excitement that I attended the Third Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. After listening to Chairman Mao's report at the Supreme State Conference on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, as well as the reports made by Chairman Zhou Enlai and other responsible comrades, I was deeply enlightened and greatly encouraged. I wholeheartedly support all the reports of the conference and will strive to implement the resolutions of this meeting.
    I would like to share some of my feelings about the benefits and progress I have gained in recent years under the education and cultivation of the Party, and seek your advice.

    The Leadership of the Communist Party is the Source of Happiness
    I feel that being able to accept the leadership of the proletariat's political party—the Communist Party—and actively serve the people is the source of happiness. For me, since Guizhou was liberated in 1949, I was nearly sixty years old. I witnessed the disintegration of the Kuomintang reactionary regime, destined to perish. At the same time, I saw that the strength of the people's revolution would inevitably achieve a great victory, which was the general trend and could not be resisted. Because I was unwilling to be exploited by the counter-revolutionaries, I was determined to sever ties with the reactionaries and return to the people. But I also deeply felt that I used to be an old warlord who controlled one side, and during the period from 1932 to 1935, I once controlled the reactionary regime in Guizhou, riding on the heads of the people and acting as a bully. Especially from 1934 to 1935, when the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army passed through Guizhou on the Long March, I mistakenly acted as an accomplice of the counter-revolutionaries, even hindering the Red Army from going north and destroying the revolution, causing serious harm to the cause of the Chinese people's revolution. When liberation came, I thought, although these sinful historical facts had passed, I wondered whether the Party and the people would be able to tolerate me. Thinking about it today, these were actually some superfluous worries. Because since I firmly embarked on the bright road of revolution, the great Chinese Communist Party has not only cared for me kindly, but also made proper arrangements and taken care of my life and work. Under the education and cultivation of the Party, I have been happily learning, happily working, and happily living for several years. In the practice of work and life, I have personally experienced that a person like me can be reborn from decay after liberation. This is entirely due to the brilliant light of the Party and Chairman Mao, which enabled me to be educated, gradually improve my political consciousness, and thus be able to repent of the past and encourage the future. Based on this concrete fact, it fully proves that the Chinese Communist Party is indeed selfless, and everything starts from the interests of the people, from the revolution, and from unity. As long as a person can return to the people and support the revolution, the Party and the People's Government have always forgiven the past, implemented a lenient policy, and carried out unity, education, and transformation. Based on this fact, it also fully demonstrates the brilliance, correctness, and greatness of the Party's people's democratic united front policy. The people's democratic united front under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party not only widely unites all forces that can be united, but also educates and transforms many people, enabling them to resolutely advance on the road of infinite happiness.

    The Motherland's Construction Undertakings are Progressing Rapidly
    Furthermore, from the observation and practice of society: In recent years, I have personally experienced and witnessed the vigorous development and rapid progress of the construction undertakings of our great motherland, which is truly progressing by leaps and bounds. The industrial construction and municipal construction in various cities, as well as the agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy construction in rural areas, have all achieved great results, showing that the beautiful rivers and mountains of the great motherland are truly lovely. With the rapid development of our country's construction undertakings, industry and commerce throughout the country are becoming increasingly prosperous, and the lives of the broad masses of the people are getting better and richer year by year. Taking our Guizhou as an example, in the past, there was the saying that "the sky is not clear for three days, the ground is not flat for three miles, and people have no three cents of silver." But since liberation, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of all ethnic groups in Guizhou have gradually built Guizhou and are about to change the past face. In the near future, after the Qian-Gui and Chuan-Qian railways are open to traffic, Guizhou will soon become the transportation hub of Southwest China, and prosperity will bring more happiness to the people of Guizhou! All of this makes every Chinese person feel excited and encouraged.

    Unite and Fight Against Foreign Enemies
    Therefore, I want to solemnly tell the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan: You have been away from the mainland of the motherland for eight years. During these long years, you have abandoned your lovely hometown, cut off from your family members, living under someone else's roof, and enduring the ugly faces of the United States, living a life of humiliation. Thinking of the past in the morning and evening, swallowing your anger, this kind of bitter situation is conceivable. Since the People's Government called for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, the number of Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan who are willing to promote peaceful liberation has been increasing, striving to return to the mainland of the motherland as soon as possible, visit relatives and friends, and joyfully reunite. This kind of feeling is also very natural. However, the United States government is extremely afraid of this and will not hesitate to take all measures to sabotage it. Recently, the United States instigated a group of people who flaunt so-called free China and so-called Taiwanese independence to carry out activities to overthrow the Taiwan authorities, attempting to turn Taiwan into an American territory like Honolulu. Chairman Zhou Enlai said: "In fact, this kind of tactic by the United States government can only make all patriotic Chinese people more clearly recognize the true face of the United States government's attempt to enslave China. Since the United States can launch a movement to overthrow the Taiwan authorities today, why can't the United States abandon those who flaunt so-called free China and Taiwanese independence tomorrow? Seeking glory by betraying the country will not only not bring glory, but will also leave a stench for thousands of years." Therefore, Chairman Zhou issued a solemn call here: "All Chinese people with blood should unite in the spirit of patriotism, and fight against foreign enemies to smash the conspiracies of American imperialism." This is especially the case for the Kuomintang military and government personnel in Taiwan, who should understand this profound significance, make a decisive decision, respond to Chairman Zhou's call with practical actions, and strive to return Taiwan to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible. This is a great contribution to the people; it is a great contribution to the country. The compatriots on the mainland are reaching out their hands to welcome you. Return! Return! Do not hesitate and mislead yourself, and miss the opportunity. (Attached picture)

### 王家烈寄语台湾军政人员  归来，归来，不要坐失良机

    王家烈寄语台湾军政人员
    归来，归来，不要坐失良机
    我以十分荣幸和非常兴奋的心情，列席了政协二届全国委员会第三次全体会议，在听了毛主席在最高国务会议上关于正确地处理人民内部矛盾问题的报告和周恩来主席及各位负责同志所作的报告以后，受到了深刻的启示和很大的鼓舞，我衷心拥护大会的各项报告，并为贯彻执行这次会议的决议而努力。
    我想就我个人几年来在党的教育和培养下所得的教益和进步，谈谈我的一些感受，借请指教。
    共产党的领导是幸福的源泉
    我感到：能够接受无产阶级的政党——共产党的领导，积极为人民服务，这就是幸福的泉源。以我来说，自1949年贵州获得解放，那时我已年近六旬，眼见国民党反动政权的分崩离析，注定必然要归于灭亡。同时也看见人民革命的力量必然要取得伟大的胜利，这已是大势所趋，不可阻挡。由于自己不愿再被反革命利用，决心割断与反动派的关系归向人民。但又深深感到：我过去是一个割据一方的旧军人，在1932年至1935年期间，一度掌握过贵州的反动政权，骑在人民头上，作威作福。尤其是在1934年至1935年，当中国工农红军万里长征路过贵州的时候，我更错误的作了反革命的帮凶，竟然阻挡红军北上，摧残革命，对中国人民革命事业有过严重的危害。当解放时我想，这些罪恶史实，虽然已成过去，但不知党和人民对我是否能够宽容？今天想来，实在是一些多余的顾虑。因为，自从我坚定走向革命的光明大道以后，伟大的中国共产党不仅亲切的关怀着我，而且对我的生活和工作都作了妥善的安排和照顾。我在党的教育和培养下，一直是愉快的学习、愉快的工作和愉快的生活着。几年来，在工作和生活实践中切身体验到，像我这样的人，自解放以后能够从衰朽而获得新生，这完全是党和毛主席的光辉照耀，才能受到教育，逐步提高了政治觉悟，从而能够悔悟过去，策励将来。根据这一具体事实，充分证明：中国共产党的确是大公无私，一切是从人民利益出发，从革命出发，从团结出发。只要一个人能够归向人民，拥护革命，党和人民政府一直是既往不咎，实行宽大政策，进行团结、教育和改造。根据这一事实，也充分说明党的人民民主统一战线政策的英明、正确和伟大。在中国共产党领导下的人民民主统一战线，不仅广泛的团结了一切可能团结的力量，而且也教育、改造了不少的人，使他们能够坚决的在无限幸福的道路上前进。
    祖国建设事业一日千里
    再从对社会的观察和实践来说：几年来，我亲身体验、亲眼看见我们伟大祖国建设事业的蓬勃发展、突飞猛进，真是一日千里。各地城市的工业建设和市政建设，农村中的农林水利建设，到处都取得伟大的成绩，显示出伟大祖国的锦绣河山实在令人可爱。随着我们国家的建设事业的飞速发展，全国各地的工商业都日益繁荣，广大人民的生活一年比一年过得更加美好和富裕。以我们贵州来说，过去有所谓“天无三日晴，地无三里平，人无三分银”的说法，但是自从解放以后，贵州各族人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，也逐渐的把贵州建设起来，快要改变过去面貌了。不久的将来，黔桂、川黔两条铁路通车以后，贵州即将成为西南交通的枢纽，富裕繁荣，将会给贵州人民带来更多的幸福！所有这一切，使每一个中国人都要感到兴奋和鼓舞。
      团结起来，一致对外
    因此我要正告在台湾的国民党军政人员：你们逃离祖国大陆已经八年了。在这悠悠的岁月中，抛别了可爱的故乡，隔绝了家庭的亲人，寄人篱下，受尽美国的脸嘴，过着屈辱的生活。风晨月夕，饮恨吞声，这种苦况，是可想而知的。自从人民政府号召和平解放台湾以来，台湾国民党军政人员中愿意促进和平解放的人日益加多，争取早日回归祖国大陆，省亲视友，欢然团聚，这种心情也是很自然的。但是美国政府对此，却是极端恐惧，不惜采取一切办法进行破坏。最近美国策动一批标榜所谓自由中国的分子和所谓台湾独立的分子，进行推翻台湾当局的活动，企图把台湾变成像檀香山一样的美国属地。周恩来主席说：“其实，美国政府这种手段只能使一切爱国的中国人更加认清美国政府企图奴役中国的真面目。今天美国既然可以发动一个推翻台湾当局的运动，明天美国又何尝不可以抛弃那些标榜所谓自由中国和台湾独立的分子呢？卖国求荣不仅无荣可得，而且还将遗臭万年。”所以周主席在此发出庄严的号召：“一切有血性的中国人，都应该本着爱国一家的精神，团结起来，一致对外，粉碎美帝国主义的阴谋。”这尤其是在台湾的国民党军政人员更应该体会这一深刻的意义，当机立断，以实际行动，响应周主席的号召，争取早日把台湾回到祖国的怀抱。这对人民来说是立了一件大功；对国家来说是有了巨大的贡献。大陆上的同胞正在伸出双手，欢迎你们。归来！归来！不要迟疑自误，坐失良机。（附图片）
