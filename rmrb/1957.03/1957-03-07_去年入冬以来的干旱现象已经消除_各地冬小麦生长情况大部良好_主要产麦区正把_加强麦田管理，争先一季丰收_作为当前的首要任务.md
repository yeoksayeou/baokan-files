    The drought since the beginning of winter last year has been eliminated.
    Winter wheat is growing well in most areas.
    Major wheat-producing areas are making "strengthening wheat field management and striving for a good harvest" their top priority.
    (Reported by this newspaper) According to preliminary statistics from agricultural departments: Although the planting area of ​​winter wheat this year has decreased slightly in Guangxi, Henan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi and other provinces due to the expansion of early-maturing crops such as barley, rapeseed, green manure, and beans, the planting area of ​​winter wheat has been expanded in North China and Southwest provinces, as well as Hubei, Hunan and other provinces. The national planting area has still increased by about 6 million mu compared with last year, totaling more than 370 million mu.
    In most areas, the normal development of wheat seedlings was affected due to drought and insufficient base fertilizer in wheat fields. However, since January, there have been three consecutive rain and snowfalls in various places. Except for Guangdong, Fujian, western Sichuan, and the upper reaches of the Liaohe River and southern Yunnan, where rain and snow were less than in the same period in previous years, other areas have had more rain and snow than in the same period in previous years. Especially in the North China Plain, western Inner Mongolia, and the middle and upper reaches of the Huai River, the amount was two to three times more than in the same period in previous years, thus eliminating the long period of drought since the beginning of winter. According to reports from various places: the growth of winter wheat has greatly improved. The 16 million mu of wheat in the Qinchuan area of ​​Shaanxi Province have generally turned green. The 56 million mu of wheat fields in Jiangsu Province have seedlings that are four to six inches tall. The 16 million mu of winter wheat in Hubei Province are mostly growing very well, with seedlings as tall as half a foot. The more than 4 million mu of wheat fields in Zhejiang Province have entered the vigorous tillering period, and only some late-sown wheat is not growing well. The 2.4 million mu of winter wheat in Fujian Province, the early-planted wheat has already begun to ear and head; harvesting has begun in individual areas. In Henan Province, which suffered from drought for about four months, about 30% of the province's 70 million mu of winter wheat has more roots and tillers and is growing well, about 40% has fewer roots and tillers and is growing generally, and about 30% is growing weakly and has many missing seedlings.
    In order to strive for a bumper wheat harvest, major wheat-producing provinces such as Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Shaanxi, and Jiangsu have all made "strengthening wheat field management and striving for a good harvest" their top priority in arranging spring production work. Xinxiang and other special districts in Henan Province have held meetings to study how to ensure a bumper wheat harvest and arrange winter wheat spring irrigation work. The Xinxiang Prefectural Commissioner's Office decided that the entire district should complete 3.8 million mu of spring irrigation tasks. From the northern Xuhuai Plain to Taihu Lake in Jiangsu Province, tens of millions of agricultural members are carrying out ditching and drainage. 80% of the low-lying wheat fields have been drained. On the more than 10 million mu of wheat fields in Huaiyin Special District, members are enthusiastically carrying out the "Wheat Field Topdressing Assault Month." Wheat fields in Songjiang, Suzhou and other special districts have been generally topdressed, and 40% of the wheat fields have been topdressed twice; half of the province's wheat fields have been fertilized with manure. In Shandong Province, after three general rain and snowfalls, the work of transporting snow to cover wheat has been particularly active. In Qihe County, more than 110,000 people and hundreds of large and small vehicles were dispatched after the snow to carry out the "field clear, road clear, house clear" snow sweeping and wheat covering activities. At the same time, various localities have actively carried out wheat field topdressing, rolling wheat and other activities. As early as the end of January, more than 20 million mu of wheat fields in Henan Province had been topdressed, and the amount of topdressing in many areas reached two to three thousand catties per mu. According to statistics from Lantian, Weinan, Xianyang, Mei County and Baoji City in Shaanxi Province, 52% of the wheat fields have been topdressed. In Hebei Province, by mid-February, more than 9.7 million mu of wheat fields had been hoed, harrowed, rolled and topdressed.
    In order to strive for a bumper wheat harvest this year, various localities will continue to work harder on the existing basis, do a good job in wheat field management, and seize the time to carry out topdressing, weeding, soil moisture conservation, spring irrigation, ditching and drainage, preventing frost and controlling pests and diseases.

### 去年入冬以来的干旱现象已经消除  各地冬小麦生长情况大部良好  主要产麦区正把“加强麦田管理，争先一季丰收”作为当前的首要任务

    去年入冬以来的干旱现象已经消除
    各地冬小麦生长情况大部良好
    主要产麦区正把“加强麦田管理，争先一季丰收”作为当前的首要任务
    本报讯　据农业部门初步统计：今年冬小麦的种植面积，尽管广西、河南、江苏、浙江、江西等省因扩大了大麦、油菜、绿肥、豆类等成熟较早的作物而略有减少，但华北和西南各省，以及湖北、湖南等省都扩大了冬小麦种植面积。全国种植面积仍比去年增加六百万亩左右，共计有三亿七千多万亩。
    大部地区曾因干旱和麦田底肥不足，麦苗正常发育受到影响。但从1月份以来，各地连下三次雨雪，除广东、福建、川西地区和辽河上游、云南南部雨雪比历年同期少外，其他地区都比历年同期多，尤其华北平原，内蒙古西部，淮河中、上游地区比历年同期多二至三倍，入冬以来较长时期的旱象因而消除。据各地反映：目前冬小麦生长情况已有很大好转。陕西省八百里秦川的一千六百多万亩小麦已普遍返青。江苏省五千六百多万亩的麦田，已苗高四至六寸。湖北省一千六百多万亩冬小麦，大部生长得很好，麦苗已高达半尺。浙江省四百多万亩麦田，早的已进入发棵旺期，只有部分迟播的小麦生长得不甚好。福建省二百四十多万亩冬小麦，早种的都已孕穗、抽穗；个别地区已开始收割。曾遭受干旱达四个月左右的河南省，全省七千多万亩的冬小麦，盘根分蘖较多、生长良好的约30％，盘根分蘖较少、生长一般的约40％，生长细弱和缺苗较多的约30％。
    为了争取小麦大丰收，河南、山东、河北、陕西、江苏等主要产麦省份，在布置春季生产工作中都把“加强麦田管理，争先一季丰收”当做首要任务。河南新乡等专区曾召开会议研究确保小麦丰收和布置冬麦春浇工作，新乡专署决定全区要完成三百八十万亩的春浇任务。江苏省北至徐淮平原，南至太湖，千万农业社员正在进行开沟排水。低洼麦田有80％已开好排水沟。淮阴专区一千多万亩麦田上，社员们正热烈开展着“麦田追肥突击月”。松江、苏州等专区的麦田已普遍追过肥，并有40％的麦田追了二次肥；全省有一半的麦田上了腊肥。山东省在三次普降雨雪后，运雪盖麦工作特别活跃。齐河县雪后出动十一万多人，数百辆大、小车，进行“场光、路光、宅光”的扫雪盖麦的活动。同时各地积极开展了麦田追肥、轧麦等活动。河南省早在1月底麦田施了追肥的即有二千多万亩，不少地区的麦田追肥数量每亩达两三千斤。陕西省据蓝田、渭南、咸阳、郿县和宝鸡市的统计，追肥麦田已有52％。河北省至2月中旬已进行锄、耙、轧和追肥的麦田达九百七十多万亩。
    为努力争取今年小麦丰收，各地将在现有的基础上继续加把劲，搞好麦田管理，抓紧追肥、锄草、保墒、春浇、开沟排水、防止霜冻和防治病虫害等工作。
