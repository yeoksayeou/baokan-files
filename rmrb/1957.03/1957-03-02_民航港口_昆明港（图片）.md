    Civil Aviation Port—Kunming Port
    Kunming Port occupies an important position in the development of China's civil aviation industry. It is not only the starting and ending point for aircraft traveling to and from southwestern China, but also a civil aviation port for China to reach Southeast Asian countries. The safe flight of the 1,400-kilometer route between China and Myanmar is entirely the responsibility of the port's employees. Last year, the entire port overfulfilled the state's task and ensured flight safety. Xinhua News Agency reporter Jiang Qisheng photographed.

    民航港口—昆明港
    昆明港在我国民用航空事业的发展中占有重要的地位，它不仅是我国西南一带飞机往来的起止点，也是我国通往东南亚各国的民航港口。中缅之间一千四百公里航线的安全飞行完全要由这个港的职工负责。去年全港超额完成了国家任务，保证了飞行安全。  	新华社记者  蒋齐生摄
