Absurd Ban
--American Newspaper Accuses Dulles of Fallacious Arguments in Banning American Journalists from Visiting China
Li Fang

Last August, the U.S. State Department issued a ban prohibiting American journalists from visiting China, which caused an uproar of protest in American public opinion circles. Despite this, the U.S. State Department has been unwilling to change its attitude on this issue. Secretary of State Dulles reaffirmed the ban at a press conference on February 5th of this year, even offering many ridiculous and absurd reasons as arguments. Dulles's speech once again aroused dissatisfaction in American public opinion circles. The American Society of Newspaper Editors and the Radio and Television News Directors Association sent telegrams to Dulles requesting the State Department to change this unreasonable ban. Various bourgeois newspapers and periodicals with different backgrounds, such as "The New York Times," "New York Herald Tribune," "The Christian Science Monitor," "The Wall Street Journal," "The Baltimore Sun," "The Washington Post," "Time" magazine, "The New Republic" magazine, and "The Nation" magazine, also published commentaries. "The New York Times" had as many as four commentaries on this issue on February 7th alone. Many newspapers criticized Dulles's incoherent and absurd arguments very impolitely.

Dulles recklessly claimed that China "actually" linked the imprisonment of American criminals with the issue of American journalists visiting China because China "hoped that some American journalists" would visit China, so they "detained" American criminals. However, Reston, the diplomatic correspondent of "The New York Times," immediately pointed out that the State Department could not "explain when and where Communist China proposed a transaction with the United States in order to release American civilians detained in that country." In another article, Reston also wrote that not only could the State Department not answer such a question, but even the Pentagon and the Central Intelligence Agency were "unaware" of this claim. The "Baltimore Sun" editorial on February 13th also said: "The press certainly does not know that the Chinese attempted to use reporters as items in a transaction. The press is completely unaware of this, and for the press, this is news." "Time" magazine added on February 18th that Dulles's claim was "not only unknown to journalists, but also apparently unknown to President Eisenhower."

In fact, it was Dulles himself who deliberately linked the issue of American criminals with the issue of journalists visiting China. "The New York Times" made this clear. In a commentary on February 7th, the newspaper wrote: "Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs, Mr. MacCardle, Assistant Secretary of State Murphy, and other senior State Department officials knew at least two years ago that some American journalists intended to go to China, but were obstructed by the State Department." And two years ago, the so-called issue of American criminals had not even occurred.

Dulles also falsely accused China of using "American citizens" as a "means of exerting pressure" on the United States. But the American press believes that Dulles himself wants to use American journalists as "tools of American foreign policy." "The New York Times" wrote on February 7th: "In 1949, the State Department accused the Peiping regime of not giving American journalists the opportunity to conduct objective reports in Communist China, and also accused China of doing so in order to influence Washington's recognition policy. Now the State Department says that this kind of suggestion from China is also a form of pressure." The State Department's attitude today is "a regression" compared to more than seven years ago. "The Wall Street Journal" editorial on February 7th said: "It is Dulles himself who has treated the ten imprisoned American criminals as diplomatic hostages." "The Christian Science Monitor" frankly accused "Washington of using the obstruction of journalists' access as a means of forcing China to release American criminals."

Dulles fabricated in his fallacious arguments that the journalists who came to China were all "selected" by China. This particularly aroused the indignation of the American press.

"The New York Times" pointed out: It is "untrue" to say that China "selected" journalists to visit. The four journalists from "The New York Times" who wanted to go to China chose themselves, and "the Chinese were willing to issue them visas." As for other journalists who requested to visit China, they also "included prominent figures in the American press." The newspaper later added that these famous journalists included the newspaper's "diplomatic column" reporter Sulzberger, CBS's Murrow, the "St. Louis Post-Dispatch"'s Childs, and the "New York Herald Tribune"'s Steele. They were not "selected by the Communist regime." "The New York Times" even ruthlessly criticized Dulles for saying that all journalists willing to visit China were "selected" by the Communists, which was actually to regard anyone who violated Dulles's ban as a Communist suspect. The newspaper accused Dulles of doing so: "It is a final despicable method adopted by a person who has committed a willful and indefensible mistake and lacks the virtue of admitting the mistake."

Another "reason" Dulles reiterated for banning American journalists from visiting China was that the United States and the People's Republic of China did not have diplomatic relations, and therefore could not issue passports to journalists requesting to visit China and provide them with "the protection of the American government."

"The New York Times" criticized this reason as untenable and inconsistent with the State Department's past practices. The newspaper said: "Linking the right to report news with the government's recognition policy is equally unsuitable for American tradition." "American journalists had been reporting in the Soviet Union for sixteen years before the United States recognized Moscow." The newspaper also pointed out that last year, the State Department approved the newspaper's reporter to visit the Mongolian People's Republic, but the United States did not diplomatically recognize this country. "The Washington Star" also believed that "American journalists are now in many unfriendly countries, and the governments of those countries have not arrested these visitors and held them hostage."

The American press believes that the State Department's ban on journalists visiting China violates the principle of freedom of the press. "The New York Herald Tribune" editorial on February 12th wrote: "In discussing the State Department's ban on journalists going to Red China, Dulles made a bad thing worse... The State Department cannot send American journalists to any part of the world. For the right of readers to be informed, the newspapers themselves can accomplish these things." "The New York Times" also said: "The American public has the right to understand what is happening in Communist China from their own observers. This is a matter of freedom of the press and freedom of understanding." "The Baltimore Sun" criticized the U.S. State Department's ban on journalists visiting China, which damaged the role of journalists, "the effect is very bad."

What is the purpose of the U.S. State Department's ban on journalists visiting China?

The "Washington Post and Times Herald" of March 5th was right: The ban on journalists visiting the People's Republic of China, in the final analysis, is to prevent the American people from knowing the situation on the vast Chinese mainland. "This policy of burying one's head in the sand is bound to fail."

    荒谬的禁令
    ——美报指责杜勒斯禁止美记者访华的谬论
    李方
    去年8月美国国务院发出了禁止美国记者访问中国的禁令后，曾引起了美国舆论界的一阵抗议风潮。尽管如此，美国国务院在这个问题上一直不肯改变态度，国务卿杜勒斯并于今年2月5日在记者招待会上重申禁令，甚至还拿出许多荒唐无稽的理由来作为论据。杜勒斯的这次谈话再次激起美国舆论界的不满。美国报纸编辑协会、美国无线电和电视记者协会都打电报给杜勒斯要求国务院改变这一无理的禁令。“纽约时报”、“纽约先驱论坛报”、“基督教科学箴言报”、“华尔街日报”、“巴尔的摩太阳报”、“华盛顿邮报”、“时代”周刊、“新共和”周刊以及“民族”周刊等各种不同背景的资产阶级报刊也都纷纷发表评论；“纽约时报”在2月7日一天之内对这个问题的评论就有四篇之多。许多报刊都很不客气地驳斥了杜勒斯语无伦次的荒谬论调。
  杜勒斯信口开河地说什么中国“实际上”把监禁美国犯人和美国记者访华问题联系起来，因为中国“希望能有某些美国记者”到中国访问，所以才“扣留”美国犯人不放。但是“纽约时报”的外交记者赖斯顿马上指出，国务院无法“说明何时何地共产党中国提出过为了释放被扣留在那个国家的美国平民要同美国进行一项交易。”赖斯顿在他的另一篇文章中还写道：不仅国务院对这样一个问题无法回答，就是连五角大楼和中央情报局对于这种说法也是“一无所闻”。“巴尔的摩太阳报”2月13日的社论也说：“新闻界当然不知道中国人企图利用记者作为一项交易中的物品。新闻界完全不知道这件事，对新闻界来说，这倒是个新闻”。2月18日的“时代”周刊则补充说：杜勒斯提出的这种说法，“不仅新闻记者不知道，连艾森豪威尔总统也显然不知道”。
    实际上正是杜勒斯自己故意把美国犯人和记者访华问题扯在一起的。关于这一点，“纽约时报”说得很清楚，该报在2月7日的一篇评论中写道：“国务院负责公共事务的助理国务卿麦卡德尔和国务卿帮办墨菲以及其他国务院高级官员，至少在两年前就知道，有些美国记者打算到中国去，但是遭到了国务院的阻挠”。而在两年前所谓美国犯人问题就根本还未发生。
    杜勒斯还诬蔑中国把“美国公民”当作向美国“施加压力的手段”。而美国报界却认为是杜勒斯自己想把美国记者当作美国“外交政策的工具”。“纽约时报”2月7日写道：“1949年国务院指责北平政权不给美国记者在共产党中国进行客观报道的机会，还指责说，中国所以这样作是为了影响华盛顿的承认政策。现在国务院却说，中国这种建议同样是一种压力的形式。”国务院今天这种态度与七年多以前相比“是一种倒退”。“华尔街日报”2月7日的社论说：“是杜勒斯自己把十个被监禁的美国犯人当作了外交上的抵押品”。“基督教科学箴言报”则坦率地指责“华盛顿利用阻止记者的通路作为迫使中国释放美国犯人的手段”。
    杜勒斯在他的谬论中捏造说，要到中国来的记者都是中国“挑选出来的”。这特别激起美国新闻界的愤慨。
      “纽约时报”指出：说中国“挑选”记者前去访问“是不真实的”。“纽约时报”的四名要去中国的记者就是自己选择的，“中国人也愿意发给他们签证”。至于其他要求访华的记者当中也“包括有美国新闻界杰出的人物”。该报后来又补充说：这些著名记者当中有该报“外交专栏”记者苏兹贝格、哥伦比亚广播公司的穆罗、“圣路易邮电报”的蔡尔兹和“纽约先驱论坛报”的史蒂尔。他们都不是“共产党政权所选定的”。“纽约时报”甚至不留情面地斥责杜勒斯把所有愿意访问中国的记者都说成是：共产党“挑选”的，实际上是要把任何违犯杜勒斯禁令的人都认为是一个共产党嫌疑犯。这家报纸指责杜勒斯的这种做法：“是一个犯了任性的、无可辩护的大错而又缺乏承认错误的美德的人所采用的一种最后的下流办法”。
    杜勒斯重申禁止美国记者访问中国的另一个“理由”是美国和中华人民共和国没有外交关系，因而不能发给要求访华的记者以护照并向他们提供“美国政府的保护”。
      “纽约时报”斥责这种理由是站不住脚的，并且和国务院过去的作法自相矛盾。该报说：“把报道新闻的权利同政府的承认政策联系起来，对于美国的传统说来同样是不适合的”。“在美国未承认莫斯科以前，美国记者在苏联已经进行了十六年的报道”。该报还指出，去年国务院曾批准该报记者访问蒙古人民共和国，可是美国并没有在外交上承认这个国家。“华盛顿明星报”也认为，“美国记者现在在许多不友好的国家里，而那些国家的政府并没有把这些访问者抓起来，把他们当作人质”。
    美国新闻界认为，国务院禁止记者来中国访问违反了新闻自由的原则。“纽约先驱论坛报”2月12日的社论写道：“在讨论国务院禁止新闻记者到红色中国去时，杜勒斯把一件坏事搞得愈发糟糕了……国务院不能把美国记者派到世界上任何一个地方去。为了读者了解情况的权利，报社自己能完成这些事情。”“纽约时报”也说：“美国公众有权从他们自己的观察家那里了解共产党中国所发生的事情。这是一个新闻自由和了解自由的问题。”“巴尔的摩太阳报”则抨击美国国务院禁止记者访问中国，损害了记者的作用，“其效果是很坏的。”
    美国国务院禁止记者访华的目的究竟何在呢？
    3月5日的“华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”说得对：禁止记者访问中华人民共和国，归根到底是不让美国人民知道辽阔的中国大陆上的情况。“这种把头藏在沙里的政策肯定是会失败的。”
