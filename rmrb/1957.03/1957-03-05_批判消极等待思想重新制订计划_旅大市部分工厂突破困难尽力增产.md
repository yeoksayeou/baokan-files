    Criticizing the Ideology of Passive Waiting, Re-formulating Plans
    Some Factories in Lüda City Break Through Difficulties and Strive to Increase Production
    (Our newspaper reports) Some factories in Lüda City have broken through difficulties such as insufficient raw materials and decided to do their best to increase production.
    Insufficient raw materials are the main difficulty in increasing production this year. Therefore, some factories in Lüda City are not confident in increasing production this year. They believe that "there are no raw materials, so what is there to increase?" Others say, "The characteristic of this year's production increase and economy campaign is that it can only focus on economy." When some factories, such as Dalian Mining Vehicle Factory, initially proposed measures to increase production and economize, they showed a tendency to only focus on economizing without increasing production. The Lüda Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, at an enlarged meeting, criticized this erroneous idea that only economizing was possible and not increasing production. It also explained that increasing production and economizing are active measures, and that the passive waiting attitude of not actively taking measures to economize on raw materials and expand sources of raw materials due to insufficient raw materials is incorrect. It also pointed out that increasing production and economizing are unified and indivisible. The purpose of economizing is to increase production; without increasing production, it is impossible to overcome the current difficulties in construction. After this meeting, leading cadres of many factories raised their understanding and adopted a proactive attitude to economize on raw materials and strive to increase production. When Dalian Mining Vehicle Factory initially compiled its annual plan, the total value of goods and the total tonnage of products did not reach the figures suggested by the state, but now they have exceeded them, and the total tonnage of products has even exceeded by 5.8%. By adopting various economizing measures, the more than 300 tons of steel saved from the production of tippers alone can increase the production of ten tippers. The original annual production plan compiled by Dalian Alkali Plant was 5,000 tons lower than the figure suggested by the state. After the enlarged meeting of the Lüda Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the factory criticized conservative thinking and re-examined the potential for increasing production. As a result, it overcame difficulties such as imbalances in equipment capacity and insufficient raw materials, and the annual output could be increased by 10,000 tons of soda ash compared with the original plan, which is 5,000 tons more than the figure suggested by the state. Many other factories, such as Dalian Oil and Fat Chemical Factory and Lüda Glass Products Factory, are actively using waste materials or substitutes to increase production and can guarantee product quality. These facts have proved that the view that only economizing is possible and not increasing production is wrong.

    批判消极等待思想重新制订计划
    旅大市部分工厂突破困难尽力增产
    本报讯  旅大市部分工厂突破原材料不足等困难，决定尽力增产。
    原材料不足是今年增产的主要困难，因此旅大市有些工厂对今年增产表示信心不足，他们认为“原材料都没有，还增什么产”，还有些人说“今年增产节约运动的特点是只能搞节约”，大连工矿车辆厂等一些工厂在初步提出增产节约措施时，就出现了只有节约而没有增产的偏向。中共旅大市委在一次扩大会议上，批判了这种认为只能节约不能增产的错误思想，并说明增产节约是积极的，因原材料不足而不积极采取措施节约原材料和扩大原材料来源的消极等待态度是不对的。还指出：增产和节约是统一不可分割的。节约的目的是增产；不增产，就不能克服当前建设中的困难。这次会议以后，许多工厂的领导干部提高了认识，都用积极的态度来节约原材料，力求增产。大连工矿车辆厂初步编制年度计划时，商品总值和产品总吨位都没达到国家建议的数字，现在却超过了，产品总吨位还超过了5.8％。经过采取各种节约措施，光是从生产翻车上节约下来的三百多吨钢材，就可增产十辆翻车。大连碱厂原来编制的全年产量计划比国家建议的数字还低五千吨。中共旅大市委扩大会议以后，这个工厂批判了保守思想，重新研究了增产的潜力，结果克服了设备能力不平衡和原材料不足等困难，全年可比原计划增产一万吨纯碱，即比国家建议的数字还多五千吨。其他许多工厂，如大连油脂化学厂、旅大玻璃制品厂等都在积极用废料或代用材料增加生产，并能保证产品质量。这些事实已经证明，认为只能节约不能增产的看法是错误的。
