Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 27th - According to surveys by relevant units, there are large quantities of scrap steel buried in the silt at the bottom of the Yangtze River near Zhongtianshengang in Jingjiang County, Jiangsu Province. During the early stages of the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang adopted a policy of non-resistance against the Japanese aggressors and blew up five warships and forty-eight steamships here.

After learning that a large amount of scrap steel was buried at the bottom of the river, the Jingjiang County People's Committee established a salvage company in October last year to specialize in salvage operations. To date, they have salvaged five tons of copper, three and a half tons of brass, forty tons of iron, and two intact boilers weighing fifteen tons each.

　  长江水下打捞废钢铁
    新华社南京27日电　据有关单位探测证实，在江苏靖江县中天生港一带的长江底下，有大批的废钢铁埋在泥沙里。抗日战争初期，国民党因为对日本侵略者采取不抵抗政策，曾经在这里炸毁了兵舰五艘，轮船四十八艘。
    靖江县人民委员会知道江底埋有大批废钢铁以后，在去年10月成立打捞公司专门进行打捞。到现在为止，已经打捞出紫铜五吨，黄铜三吨半，铁四十吨，还有两只十五吨重的完好的锅炉。
