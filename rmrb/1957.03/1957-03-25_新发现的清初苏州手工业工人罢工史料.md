Newly Discovered Historical Materials on a Strike by Handicraft Workers in Early Qing Dynasty Suzhou
Ji Yong
    Recently, many historians have suggested that Suzhou was a city where the seeds of capitalist production were germinating at the end of China’s feudal society. After the 16th century, silk weaving workshops appeared here, with handicraft workers who were paid by the day and lived on wages. In the winter of 1955, we discovered the "Eternal Prohibition of Machine Weavers' Strike Stele" from the twelfth year of the Yongzheng reign (1734) in the Machine Room Hall next to the Xuanmiao Temple, proving that labor-capital disputes already existed here in the 18th century. The workers "initiated a guild by name," demanding that factory owners increase wages and not arbitrarily dismiss workers; otherwise, they would call a strike (叫歇). Therefore, the factory owners (then called machine households) requested the government to issue a strict prohibition and stipulated the date and amount of "liquor money" to be paid annually, which the factory owners were to "engrave in stone for eternal compliance." This stele aroused great interest in the historical community. In the summer of 1956, the author and the Jiangsu Museum Preparatory Office conducted investigations with some veteran workers and learned that strikes like this were common in the late Qing Dynasty. Workers called strikes “bangxing” (帮行); the term “jiaoxie” (叫歇) was probably coined by the government.

    Recently, the Jiangsu Provincial Museum Preparatory Office discovered many such steles (used as wall stones) at the office of the Jinqiao Residents' Committee on Guangji Bridge outside Changmen, dating back to the thirty-second year of the Kangxi reign (1693), forty years earlier than the previous stele. Most of these steles were erected by cloth merchants at the time, mainly prohibiting the stamping workshop workers from coercively raising prices, and some prohibited the paper mill workers from stopping work to demand wage increases. These steles are of great value for understanding the class struggle and the lives of handicraft workers in the handicraft production of the time.

    The "chuanfang" (踹坊) were dyeing workshops specializing in dyeing cotton cloth, different from dyeing houses that dyed satin. At that time, the center of cotton cloth production was not in Suzhou, but in Songjiang to the east and Wuxi to the west. However, after Suzhou cloth merchants purchased it, the dyeing workshops processed and dyed it into cyan and blue colors, and then the stamping workshops pressed it to make it smooth before it was sold to various provinces to supply the vast countryside. The stamping and dyeing workshops were concentrated on Shantang Street outside Changmen, with no less than ten thousand workers. According to the "Suzhou Prefecture Gazetteer" of the Qianlong reign and Li Wei's memorial to the throne in the eighth year of the Yongzheng reign (1730) (see the Yongzheng Emperor's handwritten instructions), the work of the stamping workshop workers was to roll the dyed cotton cloth on a shaft, lay it on a smooth stone slab, and press it with a large stone in the shape of a concave character, weighing up to a thousand pounds. One person stepped on both ends with their feet, moving back and forth, so that the cloth was tight, thin, and glossy. The stamping workers were all propertyless, homeless, and physically strong people, supplied with stamping stones, food, and lodging by local "baotou" (包头, foremen), with a monthly rent of 3.6 qian for each stamping stone. However, the wage for stamping a bolt of cloth (generally 40 feet long) was only 1.1 fen (later increased by 3 hao after struggle). Such wages were so meager! A "baotou" controlled dozens to hundreds of workers and could earn several hundred taels of silver per month. This kind of intermediate exploitation was particularly abhorrent!

    Since the Kangxi reign, there had been frequent strikes by stamping artisans demanding wage increases. The discovered evidence proves the existence of:

    (1) A stele erected in the thirty-second year of the Kangxi reign by Lu (named Tenglong, of the Bordered White Banner of Fengtian), the chief magistrate of Suzhou Prefecture, prohibiting stamping workers from "stirring up trouble" in accordance with various "constitutional" decrees. The content was roughly that in the thirty-first year of the Kangxi reign, cloth merchants complained that "hooligans" such as Gan Gui, Luo Gui, Zhang Erhui, Wang Hua, Chen Jiuzhi, etc., posing as stamping workers, were "inciting everyone to increase prices" and "gathering crowds to beat and rob, and destroy official notices." The government put all the leaders in shackles for a month, gave them thirty strokes with a heavy rod, and escorted them back to their place of origin. Thereafter, the wages would still be in accordance with the regulations of the former governor Ma Hu, 1.1 fen per bolt (Ma Hu served in Kangxi’s eighth year—1669. Since there was this regulation at the time, there must have already been labor disputes). The stele says that the stamping workers were "physically strong and fierce, not local people with homes and land," "single and penniless, carrying nothing." This truly deserves to be called the predecessor of the "proletariat." It should be affirmed that the historical value of this stele is even greater than that of the Yongzheng "jiaoxie" stele.

    (2) "Eternal Prohibition Stele Record according to the Regulations Set by the Governor-General and Provincial Governor" established in the fortieth year of the Kangxi reign (1701) with the approval of Prefect Shi Wenzhuo (of the Plain White Banner of Fengtian) upon the merchants' request. The inscription mainly says that since the government prohibited strikes and forced wage increases, there had been temporary peace for several years. However, since the thirty-ninth year of the Kangxi reign, "the disaster of hooligans arose again." "As soon as the order of the hooligans was issued, hundreds of stamping artisans followed suit, and there was not a single day without them forming groups and beating people. As a result, the ‘baotou’ feared and avoided them, and the workshops were helpless, daring not to start working. The momentum of the chaos was even worse than in previous years!" This was clearly a large-scale riot, so the cloth merchants requested strict prohibition. The Governor-General and the Provincial Governor instructed that in the future, the baojia system should be used, with ten households jointly responsible. A circulation register should be established, and if one household harbored so-called "hooligans," the other nine households would be jointly punished. If anyone gathered a crowd, others were allowed to report it secretly. Those who caused trouble would be "transferred to the authorities" for minor offenses and "sent to the Provincial Governor for investigation" for serious offenses. The deputy magistrate and the garrison troops were responsible for the task. It seemed that the suppression was becoming more severe.

    (3) "Prohibition Stele by Imperial Envoy, Minister, Governor-General and Provincial Governor to Expel Stamping and Dyeing Hooligans," erected by cloth merchants in the fifty-fourth year of the Kangxi reign (1715). In this inscription, the stamping artisans' strike had a new development. A "hooligan" named Wang De organized the stamping workers to strike, demanding a price increase. The reason was that the workers wanted to use the increased wages to run the Universal Relief Home and the Infants' Nursery and establish a "Stamping Artisans' Guild." The cloth merchants requested strict prohibition. Officials believed that if the guild were established, it would cause "unregistered people to form cliques and come in groups, and the harm would be unpredictable." Therefore, the Governor-General, Provincial Governor, and Prefect strictly ordered the magistrates of Changyuan and Yuan counties to cane these so-called "hooligans," expel them, and escort them back to their place of origin, and erect a stele to strictly prohibit them. Here, we can understand that the "guild" was the earliest "trade union" organization, marking that the workers already had their own organization.

    (4) A prohibition stele jointly erected by cloth merchants in the fifty-ninth year of the Kangxi reign (1720). In this stele, the prohibitions against stamping artisans and hooligans were summarized into nine articles by the government based on the opinions of the cloth merchants and announced. The main points of the articles are as follows: 1. The Fengxun garrison commander (Fengqiao Xun, outside Changmen) is responsible for patrolling the workshops and is not allowed to harbor "hooligans." If any are discovered, they should be immediately expelled back to their place of origin. Those who know but do not report will be punished as neighbors. 2. The foreman (the foreman is the accountant of the "baotou") is responsible for the stamping artisans when they first enter the workshop. The foreman must be responsible for the stamping artisans. If the stamping artisans commit any illegal acts, they are not allowed to implicate the "baotou." The foreman is not allowed to omit the names of the artisans, so that "hooligans" can take the opportunity to impersonate artisans. 3. When a stamping artisan enters a workshop, he must have four artisans vouch for each other, and the details of their coming and going must be recorded in the circulation register. 4. The "baotou" shall not harbor stamping artisans without a registered residence. 5. The "baotou" shall check in rotation monthly. The method is that twelve "baotou" form a "jia" (甲, group), and one family shall be on duty as the "jiazhang" (甲长, head of the group) each month, rotating every week of the year, in charge of the circulation seal book. A "fangzong" (坊总, workshop head) shall be selected from among the "jiazhang" to manage each "jia." The stamping artisans "work during the day and are locked in the workshop at night." 6. The garrison commander dispatches patrolmen to guard the workshops, patrolling the area day and night without negligence. If there are any cunning artisans who steal cloth and flee, gamble, commit adultery, fight, gather crowds to make oaths, stop work to extort money, idly loiter, engage in drum performances, incite others to illegal acts, they shall be arrested and brought to justice. 7. If "illegal" stamping artisans are arrested and commit suicide by drowning or hanging themselves, the "fangzong" and "jiazhang" shall not be involved. 8. If artisans who have left the workshop commit crimes and confess to informing on the "baotou" for harboring stolen goods, the arresting officers are not allowed to extort money. 9. The wages are 1.13 fen per bolt, as stipulated by the various "constitutional" decrees. If the price of rice rises to 1.5 taels per stone, 2.4 qian of silver will be added per thousand bolts until the price of rice falls to 1.2 taels per stone. The cloth merchants will add 5 li for every tael of wages, called "donation," which will be a permanent regulation. From the above prohibitions, we can see the severe feudal oppression suffered by the workers at that time. But from this stele, we can also see the victory of the workers' struggle, that is, Article 9 on wages and rice subsidies. According to the inscription, this regulation was stipulated by the former Prefect Chen Pengnian (appointed in the forty-sixth year of the Kangxi reign) because the stamping artisans had repeatedly "increased prices together" (Note: In the forty-fifth year of the Kangxi reign, there was a great famine, and the price of rice skyrocketed, so there must have been a wave of strikes at this time). It can be seen that although the increase was minimal, it was not easy to obtain. Also, the stele explained "hooligans," saying that they were: "lodging in temples, appearing and disappearing in stamping workshops, or recognizing fellow villagers or claiming relatives to incite the artisans to increase prices together." It also said that at that time, "there were more than 300 "baotou" households, some with two workshops, some with three workshops, unable to check themselves, each workshop used ten accountants, specifically responsible for checking, called foremen." It can be seen that at this time, the number of workshop artisans increased rapidly, and the power of the "baotou" became greater and greater. The inscription fully shows the government's bias towards them.

    (5) "Eternal Compliance Stele Enjoining Authorities to Strictly Prohibit Paper Workshop Artisans from Holding Prices to Force Wage Increases," erected in the twenty-first year of the Qianlong reign (1756). According to the inscription, in the ninth year of the Qianlong reign, the prefect had stipulated that paper workshop wages should be based on 99% pure silver at 95% fineness. Workshop owners were not allowed to deduct, and artisans were not allowed to stop work to force increases. This year, workshop owners Pan Yongfeng, Xu Wanyuan, etc., complained that artisans Zhang Shengming, Dai Xiangkun, Xu Yulin, etc., "used the workshop owners' discount of purity as an excuse to incite everyone to stop work" and requested strict prohibition by the authorities. The authorities greatly condemned "Zhang Shengming and others for inciting work stoppages to increase prices" and stipulated that from now on, wages must still be issued according to 99% pure silver at 95% fineness, and no deductions are allowed. If violated, the offender will be punished with eighty strokes of the cane according to the law. However, if artisans request a wage increase, they will also be punished with eighty strokes of the cane according to the "holding the market to make cheap things expensive law." If they dare to incite everyone to stop work, "in addition to being punished according to the law, they will be put in shackles for two months," and "those who conceal and protect them will be punished together." Those artisans who are particularly illegal will be "sent back to their place of origin." Below is a detailed list of the various dyeing paper wages. Taking brushing Southern Red as an example, brushing five knives per day is one labor. Excluding food, the wage is 2.4 fen per labor. If five more knives are brushed, the wage and food money will be increased by 5 fen. For the following various dyeing works, the quantity unit per labor varies according to the color, but one labor is 2.4 fen, and the additional wage is 5 fen. For example, gold sprinkling, two knives per labor; sand green, seven knives per labor… There are also several kinds of wages reduced to 2.1 fen. People in the southern paper industry today probably still understand the terms used. According to historical materials from the early Qing Dynasty, the price of rice in Suzhou during the Qianlong reign was generally 1,200 wen per stone, that is, 1.2 taels. However, in the twentieth year of the Qianlong reign, there was a major drought, and the price of rice rose to 3,500 wen per stone (3.5 taels). According to this calculation, the wage for each labor, even with one sheng of rice, was less than two sheng (according to 2.4 fen, it seems to be based on two sheng). The hardship of the workers' lives can be imagined. The reason for the work stoppage to increase prices in the twenty-first year of the Qianlong reign can also be understood.

    According to Mr. Xu Yunti of the Jiangsu Museum Preparatory Office, there are more than 20 such steles on the walls of this residents' committee on Guangji Bridge, which may all be of the same system, but due to their location, it is not easy to take rubbings. It is hoped that the Suzhou Municipal Party Committee and the People's Committee will pay attention to these cultural relics and find ways to move them out for rubbing, which will be of great help to the historical community.

    Appendix: According to Gu Gongxie, a native of Wu County in the Qianlong period, in his "Excerpts from Summer Leisure Notes," there is a brief record of the stamping artisans' strike, which is consistent with the records on the stele. It is recorded as follows: "Outside Changmen Shetan, stamping workshops are lined up, with tens of thousands of artisans. They form parties and create trouble. The Duke (referring to Li Wei, from Xuzhou, who was the Provincial Governor from the seventh year of the Yongzheng reign) requested to move in one deputy magistrate, one garrison commander, one chief secretary, and one scribe to suppress and manage them (original note: now all have been cut off, only one garrison commander remains). Since then, the evil artisans have disappeared." The aforementioned memorial by Li Wei in the eighth year of the Yongzheng reign was about this matter. Because the wave of stamping artisans' strikes since the Kangxi reign did not stop until the end of the Yongzheng reign. However, there was then the "jiaoxie" of the weaving workers and the work stoppage to increase prices of the paper artisans. The workers' economic struggles rose one after another, which is indeed worthy of our attention and research.

　　新发现的清初苏州手工业工人罢工史料
　　纪庸
    近来不少史学家认为苏州是我国封建社会末期孕育了资本主义生产萌芽的城市。十六世纪以后，这里出现了丝织业手工工场，有了按日计酬、依工资为生的手工业工人。1955年冬，我们曾在玄妙观旁的机房殿发现清雍正十二年（1734）的“永禁机匠叫歇碑”，证明十八世纪在这里已有劳资纠纷。工人们“倡为帮行名色”，要求场主增加工资，并且不许随意开革工人，否则叫歇（罢工）；因此，场主们（时称机户）就请求官府出示严禁，并且规定了每年给付“酒资”的日期和数目，由场主们“勒石永遵”。这块碑引起史学界很大兴趣。1956年暑假，作者和江苏博物馆筹备处曾向一些老工人作了调查，知道在清末像这样的罢工是常有的事。工人们把罢工就叫做“帮行”；所谓“叫歇”，恐怕是官府给起的名字。
    最近，江苏省博物馆筹备处又在阊门外广济桥上津桥居民委员会的办公处发现了许多这样的碑（被用作砌墙石），时间早到康熙三十二年（1693），比前碑又早了四十年。这些碑，大部分是当时布商立的，多系奉“宪”禁止踹坊工人勒加工价，也有是禁止纸坊工人停工要求加工资的。这些碑对了解当时手工业生产中的阶级斗争和手工业工人的生活，有重要的价值。
    踹坊是专门染棉布的染坊，同染缎的染房不同。那时棉布的生产中心并不在苏州，而在东面的松江、西面的无锡。可是苏州的布商把它贩来之后，由染坊加工染成青蓝等色，再经踹坊压光，然后转贩各省，供给广大农村。踹坊染坊集中在阊门外山塘街，工人不下万余。据乾隆苏州府志及雍正八年（1730）李卫的奏疏（见雍正朱批谕旨），踹坊工人的工作是把染好颜色的棉布卷在轴上，下铺光滑石板，上压凹字形大石，重可千斤，一人足踏其两端，往来运转，则布质紧薄而有光泽。踹工均系无产无家有膂力之人，由本地的“包头”供给踹石和食宿，每月每块踹石的租金三钱六分，但踹一匹布（一般棉布每匹长四十尺）的工价只有一分一厘（后来经过斗争，增加了三毫），这样的工资是多么低廉！一个包头控制几十个到几百个工人，每月可有几百两银子收入，这种中间剥削尤为可恶！
    康熙以来，屡有踹匠罢工要求增加工资的风潮，现在所发现的证明有：
      （一）康熙三十二年苏州府正堂卢（名腾龙、奉天镶白旗人）奉各“宪”禁止踹工“倡乱”碑。内容大致是，康熙三十一年布商控告，有甘贵、罗贵、张尔惠、王华、陈久之……等“流棍”冒充踹工，“煽惑齐行增价”，“聚众殴抢，复毁官示”。官府把所有为首的人，枷号一月，并重责三十板，递解原籍。以后工价仍依前任巡抚马祜的规定，每匹一分一厘（马祜任职在康熙八年—1669，当时既有这个规定，必是已有劳资纠纷了）。这碑里说踹工是“膂力凶悍，非有家土著之民”，“孑身赤汉，一无携带”，这真配称为“无产者”的前身了。应当肯定，这个碑的史料价值，比雍正叫歇碑还要大。
      （二）康熙四十年（1701）由商人呈请知府石文焯（奉天正白旗人）批准建立的“奉督抚各宪定例永禁碑记”。碑文主要说，自从官府禁止罢工勒增工价后，数年之间，暂时安谧，但自康熙三十九年起，“流棍之祸复起”，“流棍之令一出，千百踹匠景从，成群结队抄打竟无虚日。以致包头畏避，各坊束手，莫敢有动工开踹者。变乱之势，比之昔年尤甚！”这显然已成较大规模的暴动，故布商请求严禁。总督、巡抚批示，以后要用保甲制度，十家连保，设立循环簿，如有一家容留所谓“流棍”，九家连坐。如有聚众者，许别人密告。闹事的，轻则“移解有司”，重则“送宪究办”。并责成典史和驻防军负责。看起来镇压是愈加厉害了。
      （三）康熙五十四年（1715）布商所立“奉钦差部堂督抚各宪驱逐踹染流棍禁碑”。在这个碑文里，踹匠罢工又有了新发展。有个名叫王德的“流棍”，组织踹工罢工，要求增价。其理由是工人们要用增加的工价办理普济院、育婴堂，并建立“踹匠会馆”，布商呈请严禁。官方认为如果会馆建立起来，就会使“无籍之徒，结党群来，害将叵测”。因此，由督、抚知府严令长元两县将这些所谓“流棍”杖责驱逐递解回籍，并立石严禁。这里我们体会，“会馆”就是最早的“工会”组织，标志着工人们已经有了自己的团体。
      （四）康熙五十九年（1720）布商公立的禁条碑。在这个碑里，把对踹匠流棍的禁令，按照布商的意见，由官府概括成九条公布出来。其条文要点如下：1、枫汛把总（阊门外属枫桥汛）负责巡视各坊，不许窝顿“流棍”，如有发现，立即驱逐回籍。知情不报，邻右同罪。2、踹匠初次进坊系坊长容留（坊长是包头的管账人），坊长要对踹匠负责。如踹匠有犯法之事，不许扳扯包头。坊长不许漏报匠名，致“流棍”乘机冒充匠人。3、一个踹匠进坊，必须有四个匠人互保，来去要详登循环簿。4、包头不得容留无册籍的踹匠。5、包头按月轮流稽查。其办法是包头十二家为一甲，每月一家轮值甲长，每年轮值一周，掌管循环印簿。并于甲长中推选一名为坊总，管理各甲。踹匠“日则作工，夜则关闭在坊”。6、把总调拨值坊巡役，分地巡查，昼夜毋忽。如有奸匠拐布盗逃赌博行奸斗殴聚众插（歃）盟停工科敛闲闯花鼓纠众不法，即行拿解究办。7、“不法”踹匠经拿获，如有投河自刎自缢等情同坊总甲长无涉。8、已出坊之匠如有为匪等情，供扳包头停顿赃物等不许捕役讹诈。9、工价奉各宪定例每匹一分一厘三毫，米价如涨到每石一两五钱，每千匹加银二钱四分，至米价跌至每石一两二钱为止。每工价一两，布商加给五厘，名曰“捐助”，永为定例。由上面的禁令里，看出那时工人所受的严重封建压迫。但从这个碑里也看到工人斗争的胜利，那就是第9条的工价和米贴等。据碑文，这个定例，是因为踹匠屡次“齐行增价”，由前知府陈鹏年（康熙四十六年任）规定的（按，康熙四十五年大荒年，米价暴涨，想必这时会有罢工潮）。可见虽所增极微，却也不是容易获得的。又，碑中对“流棍”作了解释，说他们是：“寄迹寺院，隐现踹坊，或认同乡，或称亲戚煽惑众匠，齐行增价。”又说当时“包头有三百余户，或有两作，或有三坊，不能分身稽查，每作用管账十人，专责稽查，名曰坊长”。 可见这时坊匠增加的迅速，包头的势派也越来越大，由碑文中充分看出官府对他们的偏袒。
    （五）乾隆二十一年（1756）“奉各宪严禁纸作坊工匠把持勒增工价永遵碑”。据碑文说，乾隆九年，曾由知府规定纸坊工银以九九平九五色为准，坊主不许克扣，工匠不许停工勒增。至本年，坊主潘永丰、许万源等呈控工人张圣明、戴象坤、徐玉林等“以坊主折扣平色为词，纠众停工”，请求官方严禁。官方对“张圣明等煽惑停工加价”大加申斥，并规定，今后工银仍必须照九九平九五色给发，不许克扣。如违，依律杖八十。可是工匠如请求增工价，也依“把持行市以贱为贵律”杖八十。如敢纠众停工，“除照律问拟外，加枷号两个月”，“小甲循隐袒庇，一并究处”。工匠不法之尤者，“解回原籍”。下面并将各种染纸工价详为开列，以刷南红为例，每日刷五刀为一工，除饭食外，每工银二分四厘，如多刷五刀，另加工银并伙食银五分。以下各种染工，按颜色不同而每工数量单位有异，但一工都是二分四厘，另加工银都是五分。例如洒金，以二刀为一工；砂绿，七刀为一工；……也有几种工银减至二分一厘的。所用术语，恐怕现在南纸行的人，还能懂得。据清初史料，乾隆间苏州米价一般是一千二百文一石，即一两二钱。但乾隆二十年有大旱灾，米价上涨至三千五百文一石（三两五钱）。准此数则每一工的工银连一升米还不到（按二分四厘，似以二升米为准），工人生活之苦可以想像；乾隆二十一年所以闹停工增价，也就可以明白其原因了。
    据江苏博物馆筹备处的徐澐杕先生说，广济桥这个居民委员会的墙壁，像这样的碑有二十多块，可能均是同一系统，但因位置关系，不易拓取。希望苏州市委和人民委员会重视这些文物，设法移出传拓，对于史学界一定有很大帮助。
        附记：按清乾隆时吴县人顾公燮所作的“消夏闲记摘抄”，对踹匠罢工，略有记载，同碑文所记相合，录之如下：“阊门外社坛，踹坊鳞次，匠以数万计，结党生事，公（指李卫，徐州人，雍正七年起为巡抚）请移驻同知一、守备一、总司一、经历一、弹压管束（原注：今皆裁去，仅存守备一），自此恶匠敛迹。”前引雍正八年李卫的折子，即为此事。因为康熙以来的踹工罢工风潮，直至雍正末始止。可是，接着就有了织工的叫歇和纸匠的停工增价。工人的经济斗争一波未平，一波又起，确是值得我们注意研究的。
