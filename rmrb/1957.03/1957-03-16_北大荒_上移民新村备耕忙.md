Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, March 14th: Immigrants in more than 400 new immigrant villages in Heilongjiang Province plan to sow more than 288,000 hectares of crops this year. Currently, they are busy with spring planting preparations.

    The Lianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Tuoli River Township, Tailai County, is striving to become a high-yield cooperative producing 4,000 jin of grain per hectare this year. They started preparing for spring planting a month ago, have now selected 150,000 jin of seeds, and are preparing firewood for the production season. All large and small farm tools have been inspected and repaired. The Dangbi Township Agricultural Cooperative in Mishan County, which achieved a bumper harvest last year, has already built a reservoir during the winter. The reservoir's storage capacity can irrigate 80 hectares of paddy fields. At the same time, the cooperative members are using the manure composting methods from their old homes in Shandong to prepare fertilizer for cultivating 100 hectares of high-yielding fields. The entire workforce of the Beijing Youth Collective Farm in Luobei County has投入(tóurù)投入 themselves to spring planting preparations. This year's planting area will increase from 300 hectares last year to 843 hectares, and 20 hectares of paddy fields will also be reclaimed. To meet the needs of large-scale planting, the labor organization has been reorganized and work areas have been divided. In addition to doing some spring planting preparations, the women in the new immigrant villages are dismantling and washing bedding and sewing single garments and shoes, so they can free up their hands to work in the fields together when the production season arrives.

    Judging from the current spring planting preparations in various villages, the production planning of the new villages has been greatly strengthened this year. Each village has formulated this year's production plan and increased production measures based on last year's production experience, rectified the production organization, and is preparing to go to the fields for production as soon as the season arrives.

    “北大荒”上移民新村备耕忙
    新华社哈尔滨14日电  黑龙江省四百多个移民新村的移民，今年计划播种二十八万八千多公顷农作物。当前，正在紧张地进行春耕准备工作。
    泰来县拖力河乡连丰农业生产合作社，争取今年成为每公顷地产粮四千斤的丰产社，在一个月以前就动手备耕，现已选好了十五万斤种子，正准备生产季节用的烧柴；大、小农具全部检修完毕。去年得到丰收的密山县当壁镇农业社，在冬季中已经修好了一座水库，这座水库的蓄水量能灌溉八十公顷水田。同时社员们用山东老家的积肥办法，沤粪准备培植一百公顷高产量的丰产田。萝北县北京青年集体农庄全部人马都投入了春耕准备工作。今年的种植面积将从去年的三百公顷增加到八百四十三公顷，还要开垦二十公顷水田。为适应大面积播种的需要，已经重新调整了劳动组织，划分了作业区。各移民新村的妇女，除了做些备耕活路外，正在拆洗被褥和缝制单衣、单鞋，以备生产季节到来好腾出身手一齐下地。
    从目前各村备耕情况看，今年新村的生产计划性大大加强，每村都根据去年的生产经验，制定今年的生产计划和增产措施，整顿了生产组织，准备季节到来立刻下地生产。
