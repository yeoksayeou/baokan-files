The problem of surgical sterilization.
    Surgical sterilization that only focuses on women is unreasonable. Vasectomy in men is simple and easy, and future anastomosis surgery can restore the function of the vas deferens, which can not only be used as a sterilization method, but also as a temporary contraceptive method.
    Family planning is currently a requirement of the vast majority of people, and therefore it is also a problem that the government attaches great importance to.
    There are various methods of family planning, mainly scientific contraception, surgical sterilization, and post-event remedial abortion.
    Scientific contraception includes the use of devices, drugs, and mastering the safe period. According to statistics, if these contraceptive methods are used properly, that is, with correct guidance from a doctor and patient persistence, the success rate can reach more than 85%. Before there are more reliable and convenient methods, these scientific contraceptive methods should be vigorously promoted. However, the effectiveness of scientific contraception is not very reliable if it does not receive correct guidance from a doctor or if it is not careful and patient enough. Therefore, people often have concerns when using them and are afraid of getting pregnant. In addition, some medicines and equipment are sometimes not easy to buy; some methods reduce the pleasure of sexual life; and some methods require special guidance and cumbersome procedures before and after use. Therefore, some people have a fluke mentality and are unwilling to use these methods. Some people are careless when using them, and it is inevitable that contraception will fail. Therefore, we need to further promote general scientific contraception; train contraception instructors; fully supply contraceptive drugs and devices, and ensure that they are used correctly; and we need to educate people to be patient and persistent, and not to be lucky. This is the only way to maximize the effectiveness of scientific contraception.
    Some people fail to prevent pregnancy. If the pregnant woman's health and other conditions are not suitable for having another child, the only remedy is abortion. However, this is an unphysiological and quite dangerous method and should be used as little as possible.
    Surgical sterilization is of considerable significance in certain situations, and is specifically described below.
    Surgical sterilization includes tubal ligation and vasectomy; and vasectomy in men is much superior to tubal ligation in women. As early as 1909, Belfield had a very clear description of the advantages of vasectomy, such as "under cocaine local anesthesia," "one-inch incision," "no need to stay in bed," "easier than a tooth extraction," "does not affect erection and ejaculation," etc. However, this surgery has not been taken seriously in the past, neither in China nor abroad. When it comes to surgical sterilization, people immediately think of tubal ligation. For example, Velde, in his book "Fertility and Infertility," actually said: "Surgical sterilization is to use surgery to prevent women from having children..." and insisted that male sterilization surgery can only be performed under two conditions: (1) the man has a serious hereditary disease; (2) the woman is young and the man is too old..." This is a wrong and absurd view. Many people in China also have this view. It seems that family planning is only a matter for women and has nothing to do with men.
    Family planning is a matter for both men and women, and it is unreasonable to simply think that surgery should be performed on women. Especially when women have chronic diseases (heart, lung, kidney, liver diseases, etc.), their bodies are already very weak, and it is difficult to actively treat them. For the sake of contraception, instead of performing surgery on men, it is even more unreasonable to perform abdominal surgery on them again. This incorrect view is generated on the one hand because the deep-rooted remnants of the idea of ​​valuing men over women have not been completely eradicated, and on the other hand because having too many children directly affects women's health and life, so women's demands for contraception are more urgent than men's. Some men do not understand their wives and simply ask their wives to have their fallopian tubes ligated, but refuse to have their vas deferens ligated. This is wrong. This wrong view should be reversed as soon as possible. Surgical contraception should use vasectomy ligation and transection as much as possible. Both of these operations are reliable, and neither affects the sexual life, temperament, or appearance of either party after the operation; but vasectomy has many obvious advantages over tubal ligation. The advantages are listed below:

    Vasectomy Ligation and Transection
    1. The operation is easy to perform, does not require hospitalization, can be completed in a few minutes, and saves a lot of manpower, material resources, time, and money.
    2. Extremely safe and painless.
    3. Absolutely does not affect health after surgery, and some people may be healthier.
    4. If used as a temporary contraceptive measure, anastomosis surgery can be redone, and this anastomosis is easy to perform and easy to succeed.
    5. No complications occur after successful anastomosis.

    Tubal Ligation and Transection
    1. The operation is more difficult, requires hospitalization, and consumes a lot of manpower, material resources, time, and money.
    2. There is danger and great pain.
    3. After the operation, some women recover their health very slowly, or even have unhealthy years (such as adhesions in the abdominal cavity after the operation, etc.).
    4. Tubal anastomosis or ovarian transplantation is more difficult to perform, and another laparotomy is required, and the operation is not easy to succeed.
    5. Even if the anastomosis is successful, ectopic pregnancy is very likely to occur when pregnancy occurs again.

    Looking at the above table in detail, it can be said with certainty that if a couple needs to undergo surgical sterilization, unless the man is not suitable for surgery due to certain special diseases or other reasons, and the woman's conditions permit it, or the woman undergoes laparotomy for other reasons (such as appendectomy, cesarean section, ectopic pregnancy, etc.), tubal ligation can be performed incidentally, vasectomy is best.

    Many people are still very unfamiliar with vasectomy. Some people are afraid that they will not be able to ejaculate during sexual intercourse after the operation, which will hinder the pleasure of sexual intercourse; some people are even afraid that semen will accumulate in the body and cannot be discharged, causing bad consequences. These concerns are unnecessary. Because semen is mainly secreted by the seminal vesicles, prostate, and bulbourethral glands, and the testicles mainly produce sperm. After cutting off the vas deferens, sexual intercourse still ejaculates as usual, but there are no sperm in it. Others worry that sexual desire may decline, and appearance and temperament will change after the operation. This is also unfounded. Because sexual desire, appearance, etc. are governed by the endocrine part of the testicles, this endocrine (or hormone) directly reaches the blood and takes effect, and does not pass through the vas deferens.

    Ge's Minor Surgery contains two sets of statistics on vasectomy, one for 3,232 people and the other for 633 people, all of which prove that there are no adverse side effects. In 1950, Garrison and Gamble reported three groups of vasectomy cases totaling 171 people, plus his own 50 cases, totaling 221 cases. After detailed investigation, 12 people (5.5%) had decreased sexual ability after the operation, 27 people (12.2%) had increased sexual ability, and 182 people (82.3%) had no change. Those with increased sexual ability were more than those with decreased sexual ability, and most of those with decreased sexual ability could find other reasons. The results of these clinical experiments fully demonstrate that vasectomy does not affect a person's sexual life.

    How many days after the operation will there be no more live sperm in the semen? This is an important issue. Belt studied 200 cases: live sperm continued to be present in the semen within 21 days after the operation, and almost all sperm in the semen were dead after 28 days. This is because the sperm remaining in the seminal vesicles have not been completely discharged. Therefore, other contraceptive methods should still be used within one month after the operation.

    Another advantage of vasectomy is that anastomosis surgery can be performed to restore the function of the vas deferens; therefore, it can be used not only as a sterilization method, but also as a temporary contraceptive method. Recently, when people talked about the problem of vasectomy, they believed that it was impossible to have children after cutting it off; even if some people heard that it could be reconnected, they also doubted how such a thin tube as the vas deferens could be connected well. The fact is not the case. From an anatomical point of view, the wall of the vas deferens is quite thick and tough, and the cavity is small, so if the intubation method is used, the broken ends can be easily aligned and the lumen can be prevented from closing. Therefore, anastomosis surgery is quite simple, and any experienced surgeon can do it well. From a physiological point of view, the vas deferens is not like other tubes in the human body such as the intestines, ureters, arteries and veins, bile ducts, etc. If the intestines, ureters, etc. are not repaired well, a slight leak may cause serious consequences, while the vas deferens will not. Furthermore, taking animal experiments as an example, some people cut off an inch of the dog's vas deferens and returned the two broken ends to their original positions in the seminal vesicles, and the two broken ends could still reconnect themselves and discharge sperm. This shows that the vas deferens has considerable recovery power.

    As for clinical experience, the success rate of anastomosis surgery in the past was 35% to 40%. According to recent literature reports, the success rate has been greatly improved due to technological improvements. In 1953, Dorsey reported on six cases he performed, three of which underwent anastomosis 3, 6, and 7 years after vasectomy, respectively, and their wives were all pregnant after the operation. One case underwent anastomosis thirteen years after vasectomy, and the sperm in the semen was normal in all aspects, but his wife was not yet pregnant when the report was made. One case underwent anastomosis nine years later, and the sperm condition was normal after the operation; however, after six months, his wife was still not pregnant. Examination of his wife's reproductive organs revealed that both fallopian tubes were blocked. Only one case had poor sperm quality in the semen after anastomosis. In 1956, Schmidt reported on five anastomosis surgeries he performed, three of whose wives were pregnant, one had poor sperm quality, and the doctor and the patient lost contact with each other in the other case and could not know the consequences. According to the above literature records, although the success rate has not reached 100%, it is still very high.

    In short, if a couple has the conditions to undergo surgical contraception, it is best for the man to undergo vasectomy. I believe that there should not be too many restrictions on people who voluntarily undergo vasectomy. As long as both husband and wife agree, and the doctor believes that there are no other diseases that are not suitable for vasectomy, the operation can be performed.

    If a man who undergoes vasectomy intends to have anastomosis surgery in the future, the doctor should not cut the vas deferens too low during vasectomy. It should be about 2.5 cm below the subcutaneous ring. If it is too low, the vas deferens will be tortuous and difficult to anastomose. At the same time, the vas deferens should only be cut off but not removed, so as to avoid tension on the vas deferens after anastomosis. Furthermore, the lower end of the vas deferens should not be ligated, so as to avoid the back pressure of accumulated semen damaging the sperm-producing vas deferens cells.

    As for how to perform vasectomy and vas deferens anastomosis, because it is entirely a technical problem, I have explained it in an article I wrote in the March 5th Health News, and I will not repeat it here.

    手术节育问题
    中医研究院附属医院外科主任  冯兰馨
    实行手术节育，单单要把手术做在妇女身上是不合理的。男子输精管结扎切断术简便易行，将来还可以施行吻合手术，恢复输精管功能，不但可作为绝育手段，也可作为一时性避孕手段。
    节制生育，目前是广大人民的要求，因而也是政府所重视的问题。
    节制生育的方法是多样的，主要的有科学避孕法，手术节育法以及事后补救的人工流产等。
    科学避孕法包括使用器械、药物、掌握安全期等。据统计，这些避孕方法若使用得当，也就是说，有医生正确的指导，并耐心坚持使用，成功率可达85％以上。在目前还没有更可靠简便的方法以前，这些科学避孕法应该大力提倡。但是科学避孕法若得不到医生正确的指导或用时不够细心和耐心，功效就不十分可靠。因此人们在使用时常有顾虑，害怕怀孕。另外有些药品器材有时不易购买；有些方法减低了性生活的快感；又有些方法除需要专门指导外，并且在使用前后手续麻烦。因此有些人存在着侥幸心理，不愿意使用这些方法。有些人使用时马马虎虎，也难免避孕失败。所以我们对一般的科学避孕法还须要进一步大力宣传；同时培养避孕指导人员；充分供应避孕药械，并使其得到正确的使用；更须要教导人们耐心坚持，不要存心侥幸。这样才能使科学避孕法达到最高的效果。
    有些人避孕失败，如果怀孕者的健康状况和其他条件，不适于再生育，补救之法只有人工流产。但是这是一种违反生理而且相当危险的方法，应当尽量少用。
    手术节育法在某些情况下是有相当意义的，今特着重叙述于下。
    手术节育法包括输卵管结扎切断术和输精管结扎切断术；而男子输精管结扎切断术较女子输卵管结扎切断术优越得多。早在1909年贝勒非（Belfield）对于输精管切断术的优越性就有很鲜明的记述，如“在可卡因局部麻醉下”“一寸刀口”，“不用卧床”，“比拔牙还容易”，“不影响勃起与射精”等。但这一手术过去无论在中国和外国都没有被重视。一谈到手术节育，人们立即想到是结扎输卵管。例如非勒迪（Velde），在他所著的“生育与不孕症”一书内竟说： “手术绝育就是用手术使女子不再生育……”，并主张只有在两个条件下可以给男子行绝育手术：（1）男子有重性的遗传病；（2）女子年青而男子年龄太大者……”。这是一个错误而荒唐的看法。在我国目前也同样有许多人有这种看法。好像节制生育只是妇女的事情，与男子无关。
    节育是男女双方的事，而单单认为要将手术做在妇女身上是不合理的。特别是当妇女有慢性病（心、肺、肾、肝病等）的时候，她们的身体已经十分衰弱，为她们积极治疗尚感棘手，为了避孕，不行手术于男子，反而再在她们身上进行剖腹手术，更不合理。这一种不正确看法的产生，一方面是由于根深蒂固的重男轻女的思想残余仍未根除，另一方面是因为生育子女过多直接影响女方的健康和生活，所以女方对避孕的要求比男方更为迫切，这样相衍成风，有些男子不体谅自己的妻子，单纯要求妻子结扎输卵管，而自己拒绝结扎输精管，这是不对的。这种错误观点应当早日扭转。手术避孕应当尽量采取结扎切断输精管法。这两种手术功效都可靠，而且手术后都不影响双方性生活和性情、外观等；但输精管手术较输卵管手术有许多明显的优点。兹表述于下：
    输精管结扎切断术1、手术易做，不用住院，几分钟可以完成，人力、物力、时间、金钱都节省得多。2、极安全、痛苦小。3、手术后绝不影响健康，有些人可能更健康。4、如果作为一时性的避孕手段，可重做吻合手术，这一吻合术容易做也容易成功。5、吻合成功后不产生任何并发症。
    输卵管结扎切断术1、手术较难做，须住院，人力、物力、时间、金钱都耗费得多。2、有危险、痛苦大。3、手术后有些妇女健康恢复得很慢，甚或有多年不健康者（如因手术后腹腔内可能发生粘连等。）4、输卵管接通术或卵巢移植术较难作，又须重新剖腹，手术也不易成功。5、即或接通成功，再怀孕时，很容易引起极有危险的子宫外孕。
    详细地看一看上表，可以肯定地说，若某对夫妇需要实行手术节育时，除男方因某些特殊疾患或其他原因不宜接受手术，而女方条件许可，或女子因其他原因（如阑尾切除、剖腹产、子宫外孕等）施行剖腹手术时可顺便做输卵管结扎切断术外，最好做输精管手术。
    现在很多人对输精管结扎切断术还很不了解。有人怕做手术后性交时不能射精，妨害了性交快感；甚至有人怕精液郁积在体内排不出来，产生恶果。这些顾虑是不必要的。因为精液主要是精囊前列腺尿道球腺所分泌的，睾丸主要是产生精子。切断输精管后，性交仍照常射精，只不过其中没有精子而已。另有人顾虑手术后性欲性能可能减退，面容、性情将有所改变。这也是毫无根据的。因为性欲性能和面容等乃睾丸内分泌部分所司理，这种内分泌（或称荷尔蒙激素）是直达血内发生作用，并不经过输精管的。
    葛氏小外科学载有输精管结扎切断手术的两组统计，一组为三千二百三十二人，另一组为六百三十三人，均证明无任何不良副作用。1950年加勒生（Garrison）及甘布（Gamble）报告的三组输精管手术计一百七十一人，另外加上他自己的五十例共二百二十一例，经过详细的调查，手术后性能力减退者十二人（5.5％），增强者二十七人（12.2％），无改变者一百八十二人（82.3％）。性能力增强者多于减退者，而且所有减退者大多数可以找出其他原因。这些临床实验的结果，充分说明输精管结扎切断手术不影响人的性生活。
    手术后多少天精液内才不再有活精子？这是一个重要问题。拜勒脱（Belt）曾研究了二百例：在手术后二十一天内精液中仍不断有活精子，到二十八天后精液中的精子则几乎全是死的。这是由于在精囊内残存的精子还没有排净的缘故。所以在手术后一个月内仍应当使用其他避孕方法。
    输精管结扎切断手术的另一个优点是，可以施行吻合手术，恢复输精管的功能；因此不但可用为绝育手段，也可以作为一时性的避孕手段。近来有人谈到输精管手术问题时，认为切断后再不能生育了；即或有人听说还可以再行接通，也怀疑像输精管这样细的管子如何能接得好呢？事实并不如此。从解剖学方面看，输精管的壁相当厚韧而腔细小，因而若用管内插线方法，断端很容易对准，又可防止管腔闭塞。所以吻合手术颇为简易，凡有经验的外科医生都能做得很好。从生理学方面说，输精管不像人体内其他管道如肠、输尿管、动静脉、胆管等那样，肠、输尿管等若修复不好，稍有漏泄，可能引起严重后果，而输精管则不会。再拿动物试验来说，有人将狗的输精管切除一寸后使两断端归还至精囊内原来的位置，两断端仍能自行接通，排出精子。这说明了输精管的恢复力是相当大的。
    至于临床经验，以往吻合手术的成功率为35％至40％。据最近文献报告，由于技术的改进，成功率已大为提高。1953年杜尔赛（Dorsey）报告了他做的六例，其中三例分别于输精管切断后三、六、七年施行吻合术，术后他们的妻子均已怀孕。一例于切断后十三年施行吻合手术，结果精液内精子各方面正常，惟做报告时其妻尚未怀孕。一例于九年后施行吻合手术，术后精子情况正常；但过了六个月其妻仍未怀孕，经检查其妻生殖器官，发现系因两侧输卵管皆不通。惟有一例施行吻合术后精液内精子情况不佳。1956年斯密特（Schmidt）报告他做的五例吻合手术，其中三例之妻均已怀孕，一例精子情况不佳，另一例医生和病人失掉了联系，未能知其后果。根据上述文献上的记载，成功率虽未能达到百分之百，但也是很高的。
    总之，一对夫妇如果有条件实行手术节育，最好由男子做输精管结扎切断术。我认为对自愿施行输精管结扎手术的人，不宜有过多的限制，只要夫妇双方同意，经医生检查认为没有其他不适于作结扎切断术的疾病，即可以施行手术。
    施行输精管结扎切断术的男子，如果有以后再作吻合术的意图，医生在作输精管切断时，切断的位置不要太低，应该在皮下环下方约2.5厘米处，若太低则精管纡曲不易吻合。同时输精管只切断而不切除，以免吻合后精管紧张。再者，精管下端不可结扎，以免囤积精液后返压力损坏产生精子的精管细胞。
    至于怎样做输精管结扎切断术和输精管吻合术，因为完全属于技术上的问题，在3月5日的健康报上我写的一篇文章中已有说明，这篇里不再多述。
