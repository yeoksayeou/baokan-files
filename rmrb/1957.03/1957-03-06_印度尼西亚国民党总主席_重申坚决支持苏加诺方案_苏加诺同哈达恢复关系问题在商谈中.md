Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 5th: Indonesian Nationalist Party Chairman Suwirjo today reaffirmed that his party, after thorough and in-depth study, has firmly decided to fully support the concept put forward by the President, and his party hopes that the President's plan can be implemented as soon as possible.

He said that as long as there is sincerity among the various political parties, a middle road to get rid of the current difficult situation can certainly be found.

President Sukarno met this morning with a delegation of seven small parties in the parliament, including the Pembangunan faction and the Hazairin faction of the Greater Indonesia Unity Party. These parties generally agree with the President's plan. Some of these parties proposed some revisions.

The President also met with Army Chief of Staff Nasution and Deputy Chief of Staff Subroto. It is believed that the two army generals reported on the recent developments in Sulawesi.

President Sukarno told "Sin Po" reporters upon returning from Surabaya that his concept is gaining increasingly widespread support from the people.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, March 5th: According to a report by Antara News Agency today, Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo had met with President Sukarno a few days ago with Army Chief of Staff Nasution and Deputy Chief of Staff Subroto. One of the important issues discussed was the relationship between President Sukarno and former Vice President Hatta and the possibility of restoring close relations between the two.

When the Army Chief of Staff and Deputy Chief of Staff met with the President again on the afternoon of March 1st, President Sukarno handed them a letter he wrote to Hatta. The content of the letter was not disclosed.
