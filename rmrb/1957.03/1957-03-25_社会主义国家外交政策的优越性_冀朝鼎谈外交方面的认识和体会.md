    Chairman Mao's instructions at the Supreme State Council meeting, Premier Zhou's report at the current CPPCC session, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report, Vice Premiers Chen Yun, and President of the Supreme People's Court Dong Biwu's speeches, all explained the superiority of the socialist system with profound theory and concrete examples. I fully support this. The very rich content in the speeches of various committee members also cited many vivid examples and statistics, fully proving the superiority of the socialist system. Of course, we still have very little experience in building socialism. Now it is still the youth of the socialist system, just like a fifteen or sixteen-year-old young person who is about to become an adult but is not yet an adult. Although he is full of vigor and has a bright future, it is inevitable that some aspects will show shortcomings of immaturity. Many of the shortcomings criticized by the committee members that I heard are this type of shortcoming. They are problems that occur in the process of growth, not difficulties exposed in the process of death like imperialism. The fact that everyone can speak freely and without reservation to raise these criticisms, this phenomenon of frank criticism is a powerful manifestation of the superiority of the socialist system. Only under the socialist system, the leadership not only does not suppress but encourages the people to raise criticisms, and only under the socialist system, these criticisms can be valued and properly and appropriately handled.

    "Peaceful Coexistence" and "Revolution Cannot Be Exported" are the Basis of Our Superiority in Handling International Relations

    Many people have talked about domestic affairs. I would like to talk about my understanding and experience in foreign affairs. I believe that Premier Zhou's report has comprehensively explained our country's foreign policy and profoundly explained the superiority of the socialist system in handling international relations. The basis of this superiority is twofold: First, our policy of peaceful coexistence. The basis of this policy is established on the fundamental principle that socialist countries do not expand outward and do not carry out aggression against other countries. At the same time, the responsible comrades of socialist countries have repeatedly made it clear, and Premier Zhou has reaffirmed this time: "We believe that revolution cannot be exported." These principles not only express the subjective wishes of the people in socialist countries, but more importantly, are determined by the objective laws of development of the socialist system. The domestic market of socialist system countries expands with the development of its productive forces, so socialist countries advocate trade with all countries on the principle of equality and mutual benefit and do not need to compete for foreign markets. Therefore, of course, there is no need to expand outwards. Socialist society opposes the exploitation of man by man. Since there is no relationship of exploitation between classes at home, there will never be a colonialist exploitation relationship between countries internationally. From this, it can be seen that the root of our peaceful policy is deeply rooted in the socialist system. It is deeply rooted, unlike the imperialism country talk peace, it is just a guise to aggression, just talking! Therefore, the peaceful policy itself is also a manifestation of the superiority of the socialist system.

    The superiority is also manifested in the unity of the socialist camp, and now this unity has been raised to a higher and more solid foundation.

    The second manifestation of the superiority of the socialist system in international relations is the unity among socialist countries. On basic issues, Premier Zhou explained that "there are no fundamental contradictions and conflicts of interest between socialist countries. Contrary to the relationship of mutual exclusion and annexation between imperialist countries, the relationship of solidarity and mutual assistance between socialist countries is a completely new type of international relationship." Premier Zhou then pointed out that the Soviet Union "is the socialist country with the strongest national strength and the most experience. It has always given the most significant assistance to other socialist countries. Therefore, the Soviet Union has naturally become the center of unity of the socialist countries. And the friendly unity between China and the Soviet Union is an extremely important part of the great unity of the socialist countries." Especially today, when imperialists are doing everything possible to sow discord and attempt to weaken us by undermining our unity, it is extremely necessary for us to deeply recognize the importance of the unity of socialist countries, especially the close unity between China and the Soviet Union. After the Polish and Hungarian incidents, the imperialists were eagerly hoping that the relationship between us would deteriorate. However, after efforts by all parties, especially the Soviet Union's declaration on October 30, China's statement on November 1, and a series of mutual visits and joint statements and communiques after negotiations, the relationship between socialist countries has improved, and the unity between us has been strengthened rather than weakened. The Polish and Hungarian incidents can be said to be a test of the relationship between socialist countries in a sense. And the experience of the past few months shows that the relationship between brotherly countries without fundamental contradictions between them can not only withstand this test, but also raise the unity between socialist countries to a higher and more solid foundation on the basis of overcoming great-power chauvinism and narrow nationalism.

    The Influence of Peaceful Forces on the World Stage Has Been Greatly Expanded, and the Imperialists Continue to Create Tensions, Which Can Only Lead to Increasing Isolation.

    Because the socialist system has the above-mentioned two advantages in handling international relations, people from socialist countries who engage in international activities always tell the truth. Therefore, the old saying that diplomats do not speak the truth is completely inapplicable to our diplomats. This situation will of course make socialist countries make more and more friends in countries and people outside the socialist society, so that the imperialists will say that we are "aggression" or "neo-colonialism" lies more and more no one believes, thus greatly expanding the influence of peaceful forces on the world stage.

    The current stage of the international comparison of progressive and reactionary forces and the above-mentioned superiority of the socialist system in handling international relations determines the general trend of the world pointed out by Premier Zhou, that is, the trend of "moving towards detente and moving towards progress." This means that we neither invade other countries nor launch any war, and because of the growing strength of the socialist camp and the growing peaceful forces of the Bandung spirit in Asia and Africa, imperialists may not dare to easily launch a war. But this does not mean that the imperialists will stop there. The imperialist system must take the path of continued expansion and create tension in an attempt to alleviate its internal contradictions. Therefore, although a global war may not dare to be easily launched, some influential magazines in the United States have predicted that there will be small local wars this year! Therefore, we must be vigilant! At the Manila Treaty Organization meeting recently held in Canberra, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles reiterated his "hatred" for the People's Republic of China and threatened: "If anyone asks him to take action in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization region, the United States will use atomic weapons!" The organization also decided to set up a permanent military planning office in Bangkok and prepare to hold three or four large-scale joint naval exercises in the Southeast Asia region this year. This is obviously unfounded and deliberately creating tension, a threat to the peace and security of the entire Asia! In fact, Dulles is trying to use the anti-communist excuse to provoke the growing friendly relations between the people of Asian countries and the Chinese people, intimidate Asian countries, and use military threats to force them to abandon various policies that are beneficial to their national independence, including neutral policies. However, according to reports from various sources, Dulles's clamor is not only dissatisfied by Asian countries, but also coldly received in the countries of most Southeast Asian organizations. Even a major newspaper in Washington, "The Washington Post and Times Herald," said that "Dulles did a foolish thing" and also believed that his "unrealistic" attack "is unlikely to make many neutral countries change their original attitude and support his cause." Yes, despite Dulles creating his tension, in today's world of growing peaceful forces, warmongers are ultimately becoming increasingly isolated. Therefore, I fully agree with Premier Zhou's view that the general trend is "towards detente and progress." At the same time, I fully support Premier Zhou's statement that "although we are willing to coexist peacefully with all countries, imperialism is still threatening us with war. We must always be vigilant and, while further developing our economy, continue to strengthen our national defense forces. The ever-growing, united socialist camp led by the Soviet Union is invincible." (Attached picture)

    社会主义国家外交政策的优越性
　　冀朝鼎谈外交方面的认识和体会
    毛主席在最高国务会议的指示，周总理在政协本次会议的报告，李富春副总理的报告，陈云副总理，董必武最高法院院长的发言，都以深刻的理论具体的事例说明社会主义制度的优越性，我完全拥护。各位委员们发言中十分丰富的内容里也举出了很多生动的事例及统计数字，充分的证明了社会主义制度的优越性。当然我们对建设社会主义的经验还很少，现在还是社会主义制度青年时代，就好像十五、六岁的将成年的尚未成年的青年，虽然生气勃勃，前途远大，但是有些地方还难免表现些不够成熟的缺点。我听到很多委员们所提出批评的缺点，就是这一类型的缺点，是生长过程中所发生的问题，而不是像帝国主义一样死亡过程中所暴露的困难。大家能够畅所欲言毫无忌讳的提出这些批评意见，这种坦白批评的现象正是社会主义制度优越性的有力表现。只有在社会主义制度下，领导上不只不压制而是鼓励人民提批评的意见，也只有在社会主义制度下，这些批评的意见才能得到重视和正确适当的处理。
    “和平共处”和“革命不能输出”是我们在处理国际关系上优越性的基础
    关于内政方面大家谈的不少了，我想在外交方面谈一谈我的认识和体会。我认为周总理的报告已全面的说明了我国的外交政策并且很深刻的说明了社会主义制度的国家在处理国际关系上的优越性。这种优越性的基础有二：第一是我们的和平共处的政策。这个政策的基础是建立在社会主义国家不向外扩张，不对其他国家进行侵略的根本原则上的。同时社会主义国家的负责同志们也曾一再的明确说过而这次周总理又重新声明：“我们认为革命是不能输出的”。这些原则不只是表现了社会主义国家中人民的主观愿望，而且更重要的是由于社会主义制度的客观发展规律所决定的。社会主义制度国家的国内市场是随着它的生产力的发展而扩大的，因此社会主义国家主张和各国在平等互利原则下进行贸易而并不需要争夺国外市场。因此，当然也不需要向外扩张。社会主义的社会是反对人剥削人的，国内既然没有阶级间的剥削关系，因此在国际间也决对不会有国与国之间的殖民主义剥削关系。由此可见我们和平政策的根子是扎在社会主义制度的里边，根深蒂固，不像帝国主义国家谈和平，只不过是进行侵略的幌子，说说而已！因此，和平政策的本身也是社会主义制度优越性的表现。
    优越性还表现在社会主义阵营的团结，现在这种团结已提高到更高的更稳固的基础上了
    社会主义制度在国际关系问题上的优越性的第二点表现是社会主义国家间的团结，周总理就基本问题说明“社会主义各国之间没有根本的矛盾和利害冲突。同帝国主义国家之间互相排挤、互相并吞的关系相反，社会主义各国的团结互助关系是一种完全新型的国际关系。”周总理接着指出苏联“是国力最强大和经验最丰富的社会主义国家。它对于其他社会主义国家一直给予最重大的援助。因此，苏联很自然地成为社会主义各国团结的中心。而中国和苏联的友好团结又是社会主义国家伟大团结的一个极其重要的部分。”特别在今天当帝国主义者千方百计的设法挑拨离间企图拿破坏我们团结的方法来削弱我们的时候，我们深刻的认识社会主义国家团结的重要性，尤其是中苏两国密切团结的重要性，是十分必要的。波匈事件后帝国主义者是引领而渴望着我们之间关系的变坏的。但是，经过各方面的努力，特别是苏联10月30日的宣言，中国11月1日的声明以及一系列的互相访问及谈判后的联合声明和公报，社会主义国家间的关系是改善了，我们之间的团结是加强了而不是削弱了。波匈事件，在某种意义上可以说是社会主义国家关系中的一种考验。而几个月以来的经过可以看出互相间没有基本矛盾的兄弟国家间的关系不只是经得起这种考验，而且是在克服大国主义倾向及狭隘民族主义倾向的基础上，把社会主义国家间的团结提高到更高的更稳固的基础上了。
    和平力量在世界舞台上的影响已大大扩大，帝国主义继续制造紧张局势，只能日趋孤立
    因为在社会主义制度下处理国际关系有上述的两种优越性，所以社会主义国家从事国际活动的人总是讲老实话的。因此外交家不讲诚实话的那句老话对于我们的外交家是完全不适用了。这种情况当然会使社会主义国家在社会主义以外的国家与人民中也结交了日益增多的朋友，使帝国主义者硬说我们是“侵略”或“新殖民主义”的谎言愈说愈没有人相信，这样就大大的扩大了和平力量在世界舞台上的影响。
    现阶段国际上进步与反动力量的对比以及上面所述社会主义制度在处理国际关系上的优越性决定了周总理所指出的世界动向的总趋势，那就是“走向和缓、走向进步的”趋势。这就是说我们既不侵略别国也不会发动任何战争，而因为社会主义阵营的日益强大以及亚非国家万隆精神的强大的和平力量的增长，帝国主义者也不一定敢轻易发动战争。但这并不是说帝国主义者就从此罢休。帝国主义制度是必须拿继续扩张以及制造紧张局势的途径来企图缓和它内部矛盾的。因此虽然全球大战也许还不敢轻易搞，但美国有一些影响的杂志已经预言今年会有小的局部战争！因此我们不能不提高警惕！最近在堪培拉召开的马尼拉条约组织会议上，美国国务卿杜勒斯曾重申他对中华人民共和国的“憎恶”，并且恫吓说：“如果有人要求他在东南亚条约组织的地区里采取行动的话，美国将使用原子武器！”该组织并决定在曼谷增设一个永久性的军事计划处并准备今年要在东南亚地区举行三次或四次大规模的联合海军演习。这显然是无的放矢，故意制造紧张局势，对整个亚洲和平和安全的威胁！实际上杜勒斯是企图用反共的借口，挑拨亚洲各国人民和中国人民之间日益增长的友好关系，恫吓亚洲国家，用军事的威胁，强迫他们放弃对他们民族独立有利的各种政策，包括中立政策。但是据各方面的报道，杜勒斯的叫嚣，不只为亚洲各国所不满，而且在大部分东南亚组织成员的国家的反映也是冷淡的。甚至华盛顿的一家主要报纸“华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”也说“杜勒斯做了一件傻事”，也认为他这“脱离实际”的攻击“不可能使许多中立国家改变他们原来的态度而支持他的事业。”是的，杜勒斯尽管制造他的紧张局势，在今日和平力量增长的世界，好战分子终究是日趋孤立的，因此我完全同意周总理的看法，总的趋势是“走向和缓，走向进步的”。同时我也完全支持周总理的说法“尽管我们愿意同一切国家和平共处，帝国主义仍在用战争来威胁我们。我们必须经常保持警惕，在进一步发展我们经济的同时，继续加强我们的国防力量。不断壮大的、团结一致的以苏联为首的社会主义阵营是不可战胜的。”（附图片）
